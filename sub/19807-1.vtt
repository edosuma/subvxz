00:39.339 --> 00:41.707
Kill the freak!
Remember the nun!

00:41.709 --> 00:43.642
Kill the freak!
Remember the nun!

00:43.644 --> 00:46.045
Kill the freak!
Remember the nun!

00:46.047 --> 00:48.047
Kill the freak!
Remember the nun!

01:08.768 --> 01:11.570
Kill the freak!
Kill the freak!

01:13.907 --> 01:15.107
Kill the freak!

01:46.739 --> 01:49.508
One last look.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.043
Okay?

01:51.045 --> 01:54.079
I want you all to look.

01:54.081 --> 01:56.849
I want you all to remember.

01:56.851 --> 01:58.484
This was a nun.

01:58.486 --> 02:02.187
<i>A few months shy
of her 80th birthday.</i>

02:02.189 --> 02:04.256
<i>A nun.</i>

02:04.258 --> 02:08.160
<i>He did this... to a nun.</i>

02:12.265 --> 02:15.601
We all know the book of Matthew.

02:15.603 --> 02:18.470
We all know what Jesus did.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.405
He called his twelve
disciples to him

02:20.407 --> 02:22.774
and he gave them the authority

02:22.776 --> 02:25.043
to cast out evil spirits.

02:25.045 --> 02:27.246
Well, today,

02:27.248 --> 02:29.148
each and every one of you

02:29.150 --> 02:32.151
has that same authority.

02:32.153 --> 02:34.286
And have no doubts
in your minds.

02:34.288 --> 02:37.689
Johnny frank Garrett
is the essence of evil.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.925
That boy is more animal
than man.

02:42.529 --> 02:46.431
But I'm not asking you
to take that on faith.

02:46.433 --> 02:49.701
You take that on the people
that knew him.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.371
From his teacher.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.339
You take it from the facts.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.942
Johnny frank Garrett's
fingerprints

02:56.944 --> 02:59.545
were found all over
sister Benz's bedroom.

02:59.547 --> 03:03.282
On the headboard, no less.

03:03.284 --> 03:06.151
There's more fingerprints
on the nightstand table,

03:06.153 --> 03:09.888
right next to her stabbed,
mutilated,

03:09.890 --> 03:12.991
and violated body.

03:16.496 --> 03:18.363
You take it from the fact

03:18.365 --> 03:20.966
that he's got a history
of violence.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.168
You take it from the fact
that he's got a history

03:23.170 --> 03:24.603
of drug abuse.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.438
Indeed, the night of the murder,

03:26.440 --> 03:28.874
he'd ingested two tabs of LSD.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.643
Two!

03:31.645 --> 03:33.979
And then he was seen
acting in an agitated

03:33.981 --> 03:35.514
and very suspicious manner

03:35.516 --> 03:39.151
mere feet from
St. Francis convent.

03:39.153 --> 03:42.020
But mostly,

03:42.022 --> 03:44.323
ladies and gentlemen,

03:45.692 --> 03:48.594
you take it from
the boy's words.

03:50.663 --> 03:53.465
You take it from his own words.

03:53.467 --> 03:56.868
He's already confessed
to the crime.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.503
To his arresting officers.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.272
He admitted it
to fellow prisoners.

04:00.274 --> 04:03.008
Hell, he even bragged about it.

04:06.679 --> 04:08.380
I'm sorry.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.787
You know...

04:21.461 --> 04:23.228
They always say
you're not supposed to

04:23.230 --> 04:26.431
take the devil at his word.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.467
And I believe that, I do.

04:28.469 --> 04:31.270
In my heart of hearts,
I believe that.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.676
But we even caught him boasting.

04:37.678 --> 04:40.712
We caught that boy
boasting about it.

04:47.186 --> 04:49.388
Let's take one last look

04:49.390 --> 04:53.058
at sister Benz.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.295
That's who you're looking at,
sister Benz.

05:00.967 --> 05:04.202
You convict that devil.

05:04.204 --> 05:07.906
You convict that devil or I
swear to god he will kill again.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.393
<i>"Avenge not yourself,</i>

05:28.395 --> 05:31.930
<i>but rather give place
unto wrath.</i>

05:31.932 --> 05:34.599
For it is written,
'justice is mine;

05:34.601 --> 05:37.169
<i>I shall repay, '
saith the lord."</i>

05:37.171 --> 05:39.338
<i>District attorney Danny hill</i>

05:39.340 --> 05:40.839
<i>has left no stone unturned</i>

05:40.841 --> 05:44.009
<i>in his zealous pursuit
for justice.</i>

05:46.914 --> 05:50.649
Well, there's dreams,
and then there's visions.

05:50.651 --> 05:54.753
This was a vision
that came to me in a dream.

05:54.755 --> 05:58.423
<i>I urge all the citizens
of Amarillo, Texas,</i>

05:58.425 --> 06:01.126
<i>to follow the lord's teachings.</i>

06:01.128 --> 06:03.962
<i>- He's investigating
- 47 individuals</i>

06:03.964 --> 06:05.497
<i>who settled in Amarillo</i>

06:05.499 --> 06:07.466
<i>under former president
Jimmy Carter's</i>

06:07.468 --> 06:09.801
<i>Cuban special placement program.</i>

06:09.803 --> 06:11.570
<i>I will not rest</i>

06:11.572 --> 06:13.505
<i>until the perpetrator
of this heinous crime</i>

06:13.507 --> 06:15.874
<i>is arrested, incarcerated,</i>

06:15.876 --> 06:19.311
<i>and executed, so help me god.</i>

06:19.313 --> 06:22.180
<i>And in this vision,
you saw the killer's face?</i>

06:22.182 --> 06:23.682
<i>Well, Kathy,</i>

06:23.684 --> 06:25.550
<i>I saw his face,</i>

06:25.552 --> 06:27.652
<i>I saw his address.</i>

06:27.654 --> 06:31.189
<i>I even saw a name.
Mr. Clyde.</i>

06:40.200 --> 06:41.767
Slow down!

06:41.769 --> 06:43.335
He's right there!

06:43.337 --> 06:45.737
Come out with your hands up!

06:45.739 --> 06:48.974
God will have mercy
on your soul.

06:54.714 --> 06:57.749
"Our father, who art in heaven,

06:57.751 --> 06:59.785
hallowed be thy name.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.521
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

07:02.523 --> 07:05.390
on earth as it is in heaven.

07:05.392 --> 07:08.260
Give us this day
our daily bread,

07:08.262 --> 07:09.928
and forgive us our trespasses,

07:09.930 --> 07:13.665
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.101
And lead us not into temptation,

07:16.103 --> 07:18.236
but deliver us from evil.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.771
For thine is the kingdom

07:19.773 --> 07:22.407
and the power and the glory,

07:22.409 --> 07:25.844
forever and ever. Amen."

07:25.846 --> 07:29.047
Okay, then. All in favor?

07:32.518 --> 07:34.986
Raise your hand
if you're in favor.

07:36.522 --> 07:39.591
Um, I'm sorry, y'all.
I have some doubts.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.393
You have some doubts?

07:41.395 --> 07:43.195
Would you like us to pray again?

07:43.197 --> 07:45.430
Uh, no, ma'am.
Thank you.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.332
Okay, okay.
First of all, a psychic?

07:47.334 --> 07:49.034
That's how they found him?

07:49.036 --> 07:51.837
Look, I don't believe in this
mumbo jumbo stuff either, but...

07:51.839 --> 07:53.772
But it turned out she was right.
Exactly.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.073
And all the other evidence...

07:55.075 --> 07:56.942
His fingerprints
all around the room?

07:56.944 --> 07:59.678
Yeah, but they didn't even...
The room? All over the bed!

07:59.680 --> 08:01.847
But they didn't even have
those prints till after...

08:01.849 --> 08:03.615
Days after...
They arrested him.

08:03.617 --> 08:06.418
But the prints were there.
They still found them.

08:06.420 --> 08:07.686
Thank god for that.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.188
I-I don't know,
it just seems backwards.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.057
You want to explain
why a 17-year-old boy's

08:12.059 --> 08:14.593
fingerprints would wind up
in a catholic nun's bedroom?

08:14.595 --> 08:16.528
I don't know, but it seems like

08:16.530 --> 08:18.163
the tail's wagging the dog here.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.065
Let's not forget, pal,

08:20.067 --> 08:21.867
he was spotted
in front of the convent

08:21.869 --> 08:24.636
the evening of the murder
and that ain't backwards.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.104
Well, he lived near
the convent, so...

08:26.106 --> 08:28.540
Acting violently,
hitting a bush with a stick

08:28.542 --> 08:30.509
over and over again.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.943
Under the influence of LSD.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.679
That's what Charles Manson
was using.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.615
Come on, we're not comparing
this scared kid

08:36.616 --> 08:38.082
to Charles Manson, are we?

08:38.085 --> 08:39.985
Remember, we have a confession.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.886
Yeah, which he did not sign.
And in my mind,

08:41.889 --> 08:44.222
it sounds like he got bullied,
or was confused.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.558
He was confused?

08:46.560 --> 08:49.427
The guy raped a nun
because he was confused?

08:49.429 --> 08:51.129
Look, his IQ is under 70.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.732
Just because he's stupid,
that doesn't make him innocent.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.133
It doesn't make him
guilty either.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.702
I'd like to say something here.

09:00.339 --> 09:03.141
I don't know about the rest of
the elderly women in Amarillo,

09:03.143 --> 09:06.711
but those weeks
after the murder,

09:06.713 --> 09:09.614
I was terrified to go to sleep.

09:09.616 --> 09:12.651
Every whistling wind,
every bump in the night.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.085
Terrified.

09:17.690 --> 09:20.258
Now, we're good people here.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.627
Good, god-fearing people.

09:22.629 --> 09:24.930
We look after each other

09:24.932 --> 09:27.299
and we look after our community.

09:28.935 --> 09:33.305
And when that is threatened,
we do something about it.

09:33.307 --> 09:35.674
Which is what we have to do.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.043
Right now.

09:38.045 --> 09:41.346
We've heard all your doubts.

09:41.348 --> 09:44.883
Now, how much longer
are you gonna keep us here?

10:08.141 --> 10:10.542
<i>Sworn and impaneled
in this case,</i>

10:10.544 --> 10:14.245
<i>find the defendant...</i>

10:14.247 --> 10:18.416
<i>Guilty of the crimes of rape
and murder in the first degree.</i>

10:18.418 --> 10:20.051
I didn't do that.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.253
I didn't do that!
I'm innocent!

10:22.255 --> 10:24.255
I didn't kill her!
I wouldn't do that!

10:24.257 --> 10:25.724
I'm innocent, I swear!

10:25.726 --> 10:27.492
I didn't kill her!
I wouldn't do that!

10:27.494 --> 10:29.094
Thank you for your fine work.

10:31.131 --> 10:34.199
- I didn't kill her!
- I'm innocent!

10:34.201 --> 10:35.667
I am innocent!

10:35.669 --> 10:37.936
I didn't kill her.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.504
I wouldn't do that!

10:39.506 --> 10:42.607
I'm innocent.
I wouldn't do that!

10:42.609 --> 10:44.943
<i>I'm innocent!</i>

10:44.945 --> 10:47.245
<i>I wouldn't do that.</i>

11:42.301 --> 11:44.969
Got one last visitor
here for you.

11:53.079 --> 11:57.215
Johnny, this is our
last chance to talk.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.853
It's not too late.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.591
Johnny, please.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.393
Get gone!

14:55.561 --> 14:59.163
We're assembled here today
to witness the execution

14:59.165 --> 15:01.232
of Johnny frank Garrett,

15:01.234 --> 15:04.502
<i>sentenced to death
by lethal injection</i>

15:04.504 --> 15:07.939
for the murder
of sister Tadea Benz.

15:07.941 --> 15:11.609
<i>Have you got anything you want
to say to us right now, son?</i>

15:17.450 --> 15:20.885
I would like to tell you all
for a final time

15:20.887 --> 15:23.388
that I am innocent...

15:25.591 --> 15:30.094
And you all can kiss
my ever-loving ass

15:30.096 --> 15:33.097
'cause I got a surprise
coming for you.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.567
<i>All of you.</i>

15:37.937 --> 15:41.005
<i>Your children,</i>

15:41.007 --> 15:43.775
<i>your families,</i>

15:43.777 --> 15:46.978
every person remotely connected

15:46.980 --> 15:50.114
to your bitch-infested
bloodlines.

15:51.817 --> 15:54.652
<i>I got a surprise for you.</i>

15:56.288 --> 16:01.092
You're gonna hear the rest
of my words soon enough.

16:04.063 --> 16:06.364
Thank you, warden.

16:38.263 --> 16:41.265
Mama.

17:36.088 --> 17:37.789
Burn in hell, freak.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.842
We got a problem.
Oh.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.343
There you go.
All right.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.978
I didn't blow them all at once.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.379
Will god still Grant my wish?

18:35.381 --> 18:37.115
Yeah, of course he will, buddy.

18:37.117 --> 18:40.251
You get them all in the first
ten seconds, god's cool with it.

19:00.540 --> 19:03.174
You need to quit messing around
with them spud joints, pal,

19:03.176 --> 19:04.775
and open a grill.
Now, I run the numbers.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.878
Trust me, the profit's
in the potatoes.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.412
Have some faith.
You got a gift.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.548
My husband is right.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.650
Paul, you are
absolutely right, sir.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.785
It is a gift

19:14.787 --> 19:17.588
when a man is so good
with his meat.

19:17.590 --> 19:20.158
We got kids running around
here, Carol.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.626
Some of them you teach.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.262
Laura, Laura...
Take it from this one.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.964
You're a woman
most surely blessed.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.701
Mom, mom, we got a man down.

19:34.072 --> 19:35.540
Jesus, Carol.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.141
Put a bell on that collar.

19:37.143 --> 19:38.809
I'm sorry about before, Laura.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.345
Sometimes I just quit
a beer too late.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.547
Oh, don't worry about it.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.415
It was funny, especially
coming from you.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.851
You ever get dirt
under your fingernails?

19:46.853 --> 19:49.587
I been getting dirt
stuck under my fingernails.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.556
You been working a lot
in the garden?

19:51.558 --> 19:53.958
They killed him
last week, you know?

19:53.960 --> 19:56.394
Johnny frank Garrett.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.229
It took ten years
but they finally did it.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.897
I know.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.333
The boy wasn't as bad
as I made him sound.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.569
He's just troubled.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.705
That da and his questions.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.440
I got flustered.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.242
That was a long time ago.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.411
And no more murders.
So that's good, right?

20:13.413 --> 20:16.280
Johnny's... you know,
it's just Johnny's murder.

20:16.282 --> 20:19.850
You know what he said
to them, right?

20:19.852 --> 20:21.719
"Kiss my ever-loving ass."

20:21.721 --> 20:23.387
Why don't we go
back down to the party?

20:23.389 --> 20:25.122
You can help me tend
to the casualties.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.457
Sometimes I am there.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.859
I'm sitting there
behind the glass,

20:28.861 --> 20:30.494
seeing the poison go in.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.563
I am watching him die.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.131
You been having
dreams about him?

20:34.133 --> 20:35.733
Uh-huh.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.069
And other times...

20:38.071 --> 20:40.338
I-I'm the nun.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.007
And he's behind me,

20:43.009 --> 20:44.475
inside me,

20:44.477 --> 20:46.510
whispering in my ear,

20:46.512 --> 20:50.448
"kiss my ever-loving ass."

20:50.450 --> 20:52.583
And he's not...
He's not too rough about it.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.418
And he's not too gentle either,

20:54.420 --> 20:56.153
oh, no, ma'am.

20:56.155 --> 20:59.557
He knows what he's doing.

20:59.559 --> 21:02.827
Let's get some coffee
inside you right now.

21:04.763 --> 21:09.634
I've been getting dirt
stuck under my fingernails.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.009
Dad?

21:18.011 --> 21:20.077
Yeah?
You passed out early.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.312
Just tucking you in.

21:21.314 --> 21:23.948
Okay.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.416
Tickle fight first?

21:25.418 --> 21:27.585
A tickle fight?
Come on, you're half asleep.

21:27.587 --> 21:28.819
Please?

21:28.821 --> 21:30.855
You think just 'cause
it's your birthday

21:30.857 --> 21:33.124
you get to have a tickle fight?

21:34.694 --> 21:37.094
Okay, okay!
Oh, no. Too late, too late.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.863
Stop, I can't...

21:38.865 --> 21:41.032
No, once it starts,
it's never gonna stop!

21:47.472 --> 21:49.140
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.408
Hey.
What do you want?

21:50.410 --> 21:51.809
What do you mean?
I know that look.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.211
What look? Well, nothing.
What do you want?

21:54.213 --> 21:55.813
All right, now, seriously.

21:55.815 --> 21:58.516
We got ten tubs of sour cream
in the Potter restaurant,

21:58.518 --> 22:00.117
in that temperamental
refrigerator.

22:00.119 --> 22:02.987
If I don't fix it,
it's gonna be a huge mess.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.890
Okay.
So, uh,

22:05.892 --> 22:07.425
about church tomorrow.

22:07.427 --> 22:10.027
Go ahead.
Really?

22:10.029 --> 22:11.696
Who loves you?
You do.

22:11.698 --> 22:14.432
You do. Thank you,
sweetheart.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.902
Yeah, I'll just sit
with Carol anyway.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.704
I'll take her to ihop
afterwards.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.639
Well, you think
she's gonna make it?

22:21.641 --> 22:23.240
I'll call her and get her up.

22:23.242 --> 22:25.643
I've been meaning to spend
some time with her anyway.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.611
She's been acting
really strange lately.

22:27.613 --> 22:29.146
Yeah, well,
you got your happy drunks,

22:29.148 --> 22:31.615
you got your angry drunks,
you got your messy drunks.

22:31.617 --> 22:34.318
She's...
She's all three at once.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.920
I mean, it's...
It's a little weird.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.521
She said she's been
having dreams

22:37.523 --> 22:39.757
about Johnny frank Garrett.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.859
Hm.

22:49.434 --> 22:52.703
<i>I don't know about the rest of
the elderly women in Amarillo,</i>

22:52.705 --> 22:54.972
<i>but those weeks
after the murder...</i>

22:54.974 --> 22:57.241
Stop. No, I can't.
<i>I was terrified to go to sleep.</i>

22:57.243 --> 22:58.676
That's not right.
<i>Terrified.</i>

22:58.678 --> 23:00.878
- No, he said...
<i>- I'm innocent!</i>

23:00.880 --> 23:02.913
<i>I wouldn't do that!
I wouldn't do that.</i>

23:02.915 --> 23:04.382
No!

23:36.181 --> 23:37.715
Oh!

23:43.121 --> 23:44.755
No!

24:00.338 --> 24:03.607
No. Leave me be!

24:15.020 --> 24:19.023
Don't you know... don't you know
who I told you to...

24:20.526 --> 24:21.926
That's not gonna work.

24:21.928 --> 24:25.062
Jesus, come back.
Jesus hold my hand.

24:25.064 --> 24:27.031
The devil said...

25:17.884 --> 25:19.250
No.

25:23.955 --> 25:25.890
Oh!

25:55.387 --> 25:56.820
The lord will protect you

25:56.822 --> 25:59.723
and there will be no evil.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.092
And the day of judgment
will come...

26:06.531 --> 26:08.365
No!

26:12.271 --> 26:14.038
Stop! No!

27:43.495 --> 27:46.964
Who can read what I've written
on the board?

27:58.109 --> 27:59.410
Lacey.

28:01.579 --> 28:03.814
Read what I've written.

28:11.322 --> 28:13.424
Go on. Read it.

28:13.426 --> 28:16.994
"Kiss my ever-loving..."

28:20.131 --> 28:21.732
Read it!

28:21.734 --> 28:24.568
"Kiss my ever-loving...

28:24.570 --> 28:26.770
Ass?"

29:34.172 --> 29:38.108
A wife, a teacher, a friend.

29:38.110 --> 29:42.246
We all knew Carol
as a selfless, happy woman,

29:42.248 --> 29:45.349
who was loved unconditionally

29:45.351 --> 29:47.251
and unanimously.

29:47.253 --> 29:49.219
That is how she
will be remembered

29:49.221 --> 29:51.922
as she takes her place with god.

29:51.924 --> 29:57.895
This we pray, this we know.

30:07.539 --> 30:10.307
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.743
The lord bless her and keep her.

30:12.745 --> 30:14.378
Amen.

30:22.754 --> 30:24.822
Dad?

30:26.758 --> 30:29.359
Dad, did you screw up?

30:29.361 --> 30:30.761
What makes you say that?

30:30.763 --> 30:32.830
Well, whenever mom takes a bath

30:32.832 --> 30:34.331
and we're in charge of dinner,

30:34.333 --> 30:36.867
it usually means you screwed up.

30:36.869 --> 30:38.435
That's a good point, but no.

30:38.437 --> 30:40.804
No major screw ups
that I'm aware of.

30:40.806 --> 30:44.541
We're just giving your mom
a night off.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.143
She sad about Mrs. Moore?

30:48.580 --> 30:50.848
Yeah, we're both sad.

30:50.850 --> 30:53.183
Aren't you sad?

30:53.185 --> 30:55.219
The kids in her class,

30:55.221 --> 30:58.355
they say she got
possessed by Satan.

30:58.357 --> 31:01.525
Which is basically the worst
thing that can happen to anyone.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.093
Possessed by Satan?

31:03.095 --> 31:04.361
What do you think about that?

31:04.363 --> 31:06.930
I think what you think.
Yeah?

31:06.932 --> 31:09.166
What do I think?

31:09.168 --> 31:10.400
Life can be shitty enough

31:10.402 --> 31:12.269
without having to worry
about Satan.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.838
Whoa, whoa. When the heck did
you ever hear me saying that?

31:14.840 --> 31:16.306
Thin walls in this house, dad.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.475
Yeah, I might have said
life can be "crappy enough."

31:18.477 --> 31:20.244
No, you didn't.
All right, all right.

31:20.246 --> 31:24.882
Look, miss Moore
got real sick real fast

31:24.884 --> 31:26.383
and that's a scary thing to see.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.453
Sometimes when people
get scared,

31:29.455 --> 31:31.722
they like to have
someone to blame.

31:31.724 --> 31:34.591
And who better to blame than...

31:45.904 --> 31:48.572
What's on your mind?

31:51.075 --> 31:54.077
So if we don't believe in Satan,

31:54.079 --> 31:56.446
does that mean we also
can't believe in god?

31:59.051 --> 32:01.518
Uh, hold that thought.

32:04.555 --> 32:07.758
Mr. Redman? Kathy Jones.
I work for channel 10.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.894
Look, sorry. I just don't want
to answer any more questions.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.763
I don't think Amarillo needs
another story

32:12.765 --> 32:13.964
on Johnny frank Garrett.

32:13.966 --> 32:15.399
Oh, my producer
feels the same way.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.501
Look, there's no story
here, Mr. Redman.

32:17.503 --> 32:19.970
At least not one I can report.

32:19.972 --> 32:21.638
I know you're friends
of Carol Moore.

32:21.640 --> 32:22.940
Yeah.

32:22.942 --> 32:24.675
I assume you remember
novella Sumner?

32:24.677 --> 32:26.109
Sure, she was on the jury.

32:26.111 --> 32:27.544
She died a few days ago.

32:27.546 --> 32:29.713
There's been
a lot of strange things

32:29.715 --> 32:31.081
happening these past few weeks.

32:31.083 --> 32:33.283
Illnesses, accidents,

32:33.285 --> 32:35.986
people connected to the trial.

32:37.722 --> 32:40.557
He wrote it the night
of his execution.

32:54.339 --> 32:57.641
Jesus. You sure this isn't
some sort of hoax or something?

32:57.643 --> 33:00.744
Six different guards witnessed
him writing it. Tipped me off.

33:00.746 --> 33:02.179
It's considered public record

33:02.181 --> 33:05.549
so the warden was obligated
to hand it over.

33:05.551 --> 33:08.452
I've got a bunch of other people
to talk to. Have a good evening.

33:08.454 --> 33:11.188
Uh, wait.
Miss Jones, um,

33:11.190 --> 33:13.991
they told us his IQ
was below 70.

33:13.993 --> 33:16.660
That's right. His teacher said
he could barely read or write.

33:16.662 --> 33:20.630
Well, then, how the hell
did he write this?

33:28.940 --> 33:31.274
"All of you responsible
for my death.

33:31.276 --> 33:32.843
You can't kill me.

33:32.845 --> 33:35.278
I will live on.
In your shadow.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.880
In the corner of your eye.

33:36.882 --> 33:39.483
I will be your secret shame.

33:39.485 --> 33:43.787
The fear that seizes you
upon your last breath."

33:43.789 --> 33:46.223
Did you take all the cushions
off the patio furniture?

33:46.225 --> 33:47.457
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Sure did.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.526
"And at the time of your death,

33:49.528 --> 33:52.496
at the death of your
wives and children,

33:52.498 --> 33:55.265
I will be there to meet you all.

33:55.267 --> 33:59.069
Damning your souls to the
deepest depths of hell."

33:59.071 --> 34:01.038
He wrote that?
Uh-huh.

34:01.040 --> 34:05.242
"And your rotten
grandparents' souls,

34:05.244 --> 34:09.612
and your worm infested
ancestors. I...

34:09.614 --> 34:12.081
I curse you all

34:12.083 --> 34:15.185
through the beginnings
and ends of time,

34:15.187 --> 34:18.722
with illness, with terror.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.357
With the agony and suffering

34:20.359 --> 34:22.225
you inflicted upon me
and my loved ones."

34:22.226 --> 34:24.127
Okay, Adam?
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

34:24.129 --> 34:27.697
"Because I know this curse
will be fulfilled,

34:27.699 --> 34:31.802
I meet death in good spirit
and with a stronger soul."

34:31.804 --> 34:34.538
Adam, can you put that
away somewhere?

34:34.540 --> 34:36.639
Somewhere I don't
have to see it?

34:36.641 --> 34:39.676
It's a curse.

34:39.678 --> 34:42.312
He cursed us.

34:43.547 --> 34:46.315
And you got to admit
it's kind of weird.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.585
Carol, novella Sumner.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.387
You know, my daddy used to say,

34:50.389 --> 34:51.922
"you talk enough about shit

34:51.924 --> 34:54.257
and you'll end up with some
on your shoes."

34:54.259 --> 34:58.128
Kind of like, "speak of the
devil and the devil appears."

34:58.130 --> 34:59.796
Except my daddy
would never say that,

34:59.798 --> 35:03.467
'cause he didn't like
to speak of the devil.

35:03.469 --> 35:06.570
- Okay, buddy, come on in.
- Just till the storm's over.

35:06.572 --> 35:10.207
Come on. Get that shoe
off our bed.

41:01.793 --> 41:05.228
- Sam?
- Coming.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.930
Sam!

41:06.932 --> 41:08.531
I'm coming.

41:08.533 --> 41:11.801
Adam.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.436
You heard your mother, pal.

41:13.438 --> 41:15.738
Uh-huh. She's saying
it's time for bed,

41:15.740 --> 41:17.874
but I'm almost to fort hall.

41:19.478 --> 41:21.678
See? I was totally coming.

43:45.456 --> 43:46.723
Babe.
Hmm?

43:46.725 --> 43:48.124
Babe, I'm at the blue mountains.

43:48.126 --> 43:50.059
I think I'm going
to make it to Oregon.

43:50.061 --> 43:51.461
Uh-oh.

43:51.463 --> 43:53.863
Yeah, you better not save that,

43:53.865 --> 43:56.165
otherwise Sam's gonna know
you've been playing.

43:56.167 --> 43:57.166
He will?
Yeah.

43:57.168 --> 43:58.601
So, what do I do?
I don't know.

43:58.603 --> 44:00.236
Adam, help me.
What do I do?

44:00.238 --> 44:03.806
Oh, Mrs. Redman, your son is
going to be very, very upset.

44:14.486 --> 44:16.719
Sam, wake up!
Hey, hey, hey!

44:16.721 --> 44:18.354
Hey, Sam, come on.

44:18.356 --> 44:19.555
Wake up. Wake up, buddy.

44:19.557 --> 44:21.224
Come on, wake up.

44:24.262 --> 44:25.595
Why isn't he waking up?

44:25.597 --> 44:28.031
I think it's a night terror.

44:28.033 --> 44:29.599
Hey, come on, Sam.

44:29.601 --> 44:31.000
Sammy, you can do it.
You can do it.

44:31.002 --> 44:32.502
- There you go.
- Hey.

44:32.504 --> 44:34.570
There you go, buddy.

44:34.572 --> 44:36.105
You gave us a big scare.

44:36.107 --> 44:38.775
You were having one doozy
of a nightmare.

44:42.913 --> 44:45.715
What's wrong with him now?

44:52.556 --> 44:54.490
- Sam!
- Whoa, whoa!

44:54.492 --> 44:56.292
Sam.
Whoa, buddy.

44:56.294 --> 44:58.461
Hey, Sam.

45:02.599 --> 45:04.167
Where am I?

45:04.169 --> 45:06.469
- Hey, it's okay.
- You're in your bedroom.

45:06.471 --> 45:07.737
What happened?

45:07.739 --> 45:09.906
You had a bad dream.

45:13.277 --> 45:14.811
I'm sorry.

45:16.214 --> 45:17.613
I didn't mean to.

45:17.615 --> 45:19.749
Don't you worry about that.

45:19.751 --> 45:20.950
It happens to the best of us.

45:20.952 --> 45:23.119
That was a pretty bad nightmare.

45:23.121 --> 45:25.521
Yeah, well,
that's not surprising,

45:25.523 --> 45:28.758
given what all the kids
are saying about Mrs. Moore.

45:28.760 --> 45:31.694
But it wasn't
about Mrs. Moore.

45:31.696 --> 45:33.830
Or the devil.

45:33.832 --> 45:35.364
It was just...

45:35.366 --> 45:36.799
Men.

45:39.069 --> 45:40.103
Men?

45:40.105 --> 45:42.338
They were in a circle around me,

45:42.340 --> 45:46.909
laughing and smoking cigarettes.

45:46.911 --> 45:50.480
But they were also using
the cigarettes to burn me.

45:50.482 --> 45:52.482
Everywhere.

45:52.484 --> 45:55.084
All over.

45:56.253 --> 45:59.122
I was naked.

45:59.124 --> 46:00.990
Mr. Clyde
tried to stop them,

46:00.992 --> 46:05.828
but that just made
them laugh harder.

46:05.830 --> 46:08.297
Then they burned him too.

46:08.299 --> 46:11.801
There was a Mr. Clyde
in your dream?

46:11.803 --> 46:14.403
Mr. Clyde was my dog.

46:33.824 --> 46:36.826
You have kids
or kids are on the way.

46:36.828 --> 46:38.795
We have a 10-year-old son.

46:38.797 --> 46:40.396
Judd.

46:40.398 --> 46:42.598
You sure do.

46:42.600 --> 46:44.400
Judd's a good boy.

46:44.402 --> 46:46.269
Most of the time.

46:46.271 --> 46:50.139
Does get a bit of the devil
in him from time to time, right?

46:50.141 --> 46:52.542
Yeah, well, you nailed it.

46:52.544 --> 46:57.513
He likes sports and video games.

47:00.784 --> 47:04.420
Judd looks up to you a lot,
in case you didn't know that.

47:09.560 --> 47:12.094
There's something...

47:14.364 --> 47:17.900
There's something potentially
troubling with your son.

47:25.108 --> 47:28.811
And there's something
you need to avoid.

47:28.813 --> 47:30.613
What?

47:33.817 --> 47:35.818
I can't see what it is.

47:35.820 --> 47:37.854
Then how do I know
how to avoid it?

47:38.856 --> 47:40.990
Well, yeah...

47:40.992 --> 47:43.259
That's easy.

47:44.294 --> 47:47.597
I can just do
a full tarot sweep.

47:47.599 --> 47:51.567
It's only 20 bucks
on top of the read.

47:51.569 --> 47:56.005
Okay. So you helped crack
the Johnny frank Garrett case?

47:56.007 --> 47:57.540
I sure did.

47:58.977 --> 48:03.246
It's my most renowned
psychic achievement.

48:03.248 --> 48:06.048
So you had a dream about him

48:06.050 --> 48:08.918
and his dog, Mr. Clyde?

48:08.920 --> 48:10.753
It was a vision.

48:10.755 --> 48:13.389
Came to me in a dream.

48:13.391 --> 48:17.226
That's how most people know
I'm not just some phony.

48:17.228 --> 48:19.595
See, when the cops are in a jam,

48:19.597 --> 48:24.100
they come to yours truly.

48:28.338 --> 48:29.705
Wow.

48:29.707 --> 48:34.543
Um, so then the police
came to you for help?

48:34.545 --> 48:36.345
Then you had the dream?

48:36.347 --> 48:38.981
The vision.
The vision. Yeah.

48:38.983 --> 48:41.651
Yeah. That's right.

48:41.653 --> 48:44.153
Then you ID'd Johnny.

48:44.155 --> 48:48.124
Then the cops arrested him,
took his prints.

48:48.126 --> 48:50.026
I'm just trying
to figure it out.

48:50.028 --> 48:51.861
Then they went back
to the convent

48:51.863 --> 48:53.696
and made the match?

48:53.698 --> 48:56.165
My husband's back soon.

48:56.167 --> 48:59.702
Are you gonna
cut the deck or what?

49:00.904 --> 49:02.939
What do you know about curses?

49:05.142 --> 49:08.110
Baby, this is just a reading.

49:08.112 --> 49:10.313
You want a full consult,

49:10.315 --> 49:15.518
that's gonna cost you
50 bucks an hour.

49:15.520 --> 49:17.653
It's just a lot of strange
things have been going on

49:17.655 --> 49:20.323
since Johnny's execution,
and I guess I...

49:20.325 --> 49:22.792
I'm just wondering.
I don't know if...

49:22.794 --> 49:27.163
If you've experienced
anything out of the ordinary.

49:27.165 --> 49:30.232
Well, the moment
they sent that demon child

49:30.234 --> 49:33.069
back to the hell he came from,

49:33.071 --> 49:37.373
I had this sense of purging.

49:38.443 --> 49:41.677
It was like a spiritual release.

49:43.513 --> 49:45.481
That night, I...

49:45.483 --> 49:49.652
I dreamt of sunshine
on the lake...

49:50.754 --> 49:53.456
Fresh baked pies.

49:58.595 --> 50:02.465
So you want to know
how to help Judd or what?

50:02.467 --> 50:04.533
Judd?

50:04.535 --> 50:07.636
Your son.

50:52.015 --> 50:53.649
Aah!

51:15.338 --> 51:18.607
What did you do with my sweetie?

51:48.271 --> 51:49.805
Kathy Jones, please.

51:55.378 --> 51:58.380
<i>You know what kind of curse
holds the most power?</i>

51:58.382 --> 51:59.949
<i>The curse of the innocent.</i>

51:59.951 --> 52:03.319
<i>Those unfairly persecuted
who died unjustly.</i>

52:03.321 --> 52:04.987
<i>Martyrs. Heretics.</i>

52:04.989 --> 52:06.789
<i>Witches burned at the stake.</i>

52:06.791 --> 52:09.525
<i>What's that got to do
with anything?</i>

52:13.029 --> 52:14.663
What aren't you telling me?

52:18.768 --> 52:20.236
The psychic lied to me.

52:20.238 --> 52:23.139
It just all happened so fast.

52:23.141 --> 52:25.040
The tide was going with Johnny,

52:25.042 --> 52:26.976
I got an exclusive with her.

52:26.978 --> 52:31.080
It was a career-changing move.
I just... I went with it.

52:31.082 --> 52:32.748
How can you be sure
she was lying?

52:32.750 --> 52:34.316
She called me.

52:34.318 --> 52:36.485
I asked her if she'd been
in contact with the police,

52:36.487 --> 52:37.820
and she acted like she hadn't.

52:37.822 --> 52:39.622
Well, she told me
the police came to her.

52:39.624 --> 52:42.992
That was later, before they got
their stories straight.

52:42.994 --> 52:44.326
Who got their stories straight?

52:44.328 --> 52:46.228
Her and Danny hill.

52:46.230 --> 52:48.097
The district attorney?

52:48.099 --> 52:49.732
She tried to gloss it over.

52:49.734 --> 52:53.235
Said she sometimes gets confused
after severe psychic activity.

52:53.237 --> 52:54.537
But you knew she was lying?

52:54.539 --> 52:55.971
Everybody just followed suit.

52:55.973 --> 52:57.339
Lazy defense lawyers,

52:57.341 --> 52:59.808
corrupt medical examiners
losing evidence.

52:59.810 --> 53:02.645
A priest from St. Francis
not being allowed to testify.

53:02.647 --> 53:05.548
A priest? Why would a priest
testify on his behalf?

53:05.550 --> 53:09.285
Because Johnny did
volunteer work at St. Francis.

53:09.287 --> 53:11.420
Why didn't anybody tell us that?

53:11.422 --> 53:12.922
They didn't want us to know.

53:12.924 --> 53:15.057
You're saying he might
have been innocent.

53:15.059 --> 53:16.659
I convicted him.

53:16.661 --> 53:18.160
We all did.

53:18.162 --> 53:20.062
No, "we" didn't. I did.

53:20.064 --> 53:22.598
I was on that jury.

53:42.619 --> 53:44.353
Johnny was a troubled boy.

53:44.355 --> 53:46.855
The things he shared with me,
with the sisters.

53:46.857 --> 53:48.624
It was very sad.

53:48.626 --> 53:50.092
Like what kind of things?

53:50.094 --> 53:52.561
Johnny took us into
his confidence, Mr. Redman.

53:52.563 --> 53:54.396
I will tell you this, though.

53:54.398 --> 53:56.765
There were many nights
he did not want to go home.

53:56.767 --> 53:58.500
He'd make up excuses
to stay here.

53:58.502 --> 54:00.069
Find chores that needed doing.

54:00.071 --> 54:02.404
So his fingerprints
would have already been here,

54:02.406 --> 54:03.973
all over the place.

54:03.975 --> 54:05.374
I'll tell you this:

54:05.376 --> 54:07.910
Johnny Garrett was not
a rapist or a killer.

54:07.912 --> 54:10.412
And I should have done more,

54:10.414 --> 54:12.581
far more, to make that known.

54:12.583 --> 54:14.183
I mean, I did try.

54:14.185 --> 54:16.252
I went to Dan hill,
to the lawyers.

54:16.254 --> 54:17.486
Said I would testify.

54:17.488 --> 54:18.887
I just kept getting
the runaround.

54:18.889 --> 54:20.756
Even from
Johnny Garrett's lawyers?

54:20.758 --> 54:21.890
From everyone.

54:21.892 --> 54:24.159
But ultimately,
I must take the responsibility.

54:24.161 --> 54:25.461
I didn't do enough.

54:25.463 --> 54:29.131
And so I played a role
in what happened to him

54:29.133 --> 54:32.001
and what he finally became.

54:33.837 --> 54:37.139
I'm not one for religion,
no offense,

54:37.141 --> 54:39.541
but do you believe in...

54:39.543 --> 54:42.077
I can't even believe
I'm asking this.

54:42.079 --> 54:43.512
Evil spirits?

54:43.514 --> 54:46.649
Well, I believe Satan rarely
misses an opportunity

54:46.651 --> 54:49.318
to inveigle himself
into our world.

54:49.320 --> 54:51.954
It could be in a jealous thought

54:51.956 --> 54:53.555
or an angry gesture.

54:53.557 --> 54:57.793
Or on the dying lips
of an innocent man.

54:57.795 --> 54:58.994
Why?

55:06.970 --> 55:09.972
No. No. No.

55:13.643 --> 55:16.879
Would you rather be
a piece of pizza

55:16.881 --> 55:18.914
or an ice-cream cone?

55:21.118 --> 55:22.985
Ice cream melts.

55:22.987 --> 55:25.721
<i>Johnny Garrett was not
a rapist or a killer.</i>

55:25.723 --> 55:27.623
<i>I convicted him.</i>

55:27.625 --> 55:32.394
<i>They sent that demon child
back to the hell he came from.</i>

55:32.396 --> 55:35.331
<i>Johnny Garrett was not
a rapist or a killer.</i>

55:35.333 --> 55:37.499
<i>Johnny Garrett
was not a rapist...</i>

55:37.501 --> 55:38.901
<i>I convicted him.</i>

55:38.903 --> 55:40.769
<i>The psychic lied to me.</i>

55:40.771 --> 55:42.604
<i>I convicted him.</i>

55:42.606 --> 55:45.240
<i>Johnny Garrett was not
a rapist or a killer.</i>

55:45.242 --> 55:48.043
<i>- The psychic lied to me.
- The psychic lied to me.</i>

55:48.045 --> 55:50.913
<i>Johnny Garrett was not
a rapist or a killer.</i>

55:50.915 --> 55:52.648
What?

55:52.650 --> 55:55.117
You're flopping around
like a fish.

55:55.119 --> 55:56.385
You're mumbling too.

55:58.289 --> 55:59.555
I could sleep on the couch.

55:59.557 --> 56:03.125
No, stay here.

56:03.127 --> 56:07.396
Seems like such a shame to let
all that energy go to waste.

56:13.136 --> 56:15.003
Baby, stop, stop.

56:15.005 --> 56:16.905
I got to tell you something.

56:20.945 --> 56:22.511
What is it?

56:27.884 --> 56:30.986
I saw a man die today.

56:32.322 --> 56:33.956
You what?

56:37.127 --> 56:39.128
I saw a man die today.

56:41.765 --> 56:43.665
I didn't... I didn't want
to say anything,

56:43.667 --> 56:45.934
because I didn't want
Sam to hear before.

56:45.936 --> 56:47.669
And then, I don't know.
I was just...

56:47.671 --> 56:51.807
I was just trying to
block it from my mind.

56:54.778 --> 56:57.112
You want to talk about it?

57:00.417 --> 57:03.919
I think it's got something
to do with Johnny frank Garrett.

57:06.055 --> 57:08.223
Adam, you don't really
think that's true.

57:09.994 --> 57:12.094
What was that?

57:12.096 --> 57:14.096
I don't know.

57:29.279 --> 57:31.180
Sam? Sam?
Sam?

58:51.794 --> 58:53.595
A degenerative heart condition?

58:53.597 --> 58:54.796
What does that mean?

58:54.798 --> 58:56.798
He was most likely born with it.

58:56.800 --> 58:58.901
But Sam's a healthy kid.

58:58.903 --> 59:00.702
It just didn't
present itself until now.

59:00.704 --> 59:02.237
I've made a few phone calls.

59:02.239 --> 59:04.439
I'd like to get more
opinions on how to proceed.

59:04.441 --> 59:06.174
But you can fix it?
We can stabilize him.

59:06.176 --> 59:08.777
Make sure he doesn't put any
more strain on the ventricles.

59:08.779 --> 59:10.279
But in the next 24 hours

59:10.281 --> 59:12.514
there's a high possibility
of cardiac failure.

59:12.516 --> 59:13.916
Cardiac failure?

59:13.918 --> 59:16.585
He's 10.
My son is 10 years old.

59:16.587 --> 59:18.420
This doesn't happen
to 10-year-olds.

59:18.422 --> 59:20.889
Like I said, I have some
very knowledgeable colleagues

59:20.891 --> 59:23.525
I'm excited to consult with.
More knowledgeable than you?

59:23.527 --> 59:25.861
Mrs. Redman,
the good news is

59:25.863 --> 59:28.030
we're no longer flying
under the radar.

59:28.032 --> 59:30.632
Let's just be thankful for that.

59:30.634 --> 59:32.768
Thank you, doctor.

59:43.079 --> 59:45.614
I got the same blood type
as my son.

59:45.616 --> 59:46.815
Doctor said it might help.

59:46.817 --> 59:48.250
Uh-huh.

59:48.252 --> 59:49.818
You a fainter?

59:49.820 --> 59:52.988
No, ma'am.
I'm just not a fan of needles.

59:52.990 --> 59:54.089
Uh-huh.

59:54.091 --> 59:57.259
Now, this is gonna
be a piece of cake.

01:00:04.068 --> 01:00:05.634
Didn't even feel it, did you?

01:00:07.304 --> 01:00:10.038
No, no, no. You're...

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.306
You're good.

01:00:11.308 --> 01:00:12.741
I know.

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:13.976
That's the worst of it.

01:00:13.978 --> 01:00:16.645
Why don't you take a nap?

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.900
Burn in hell, freak.

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:42.704
Burn in hell, freak.

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:48.577
Burn in hell, freak.

01:00:48.579 --> 01:00:50.679
Burn in hell, freak!

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:56.752
Hey! Whoa!

01:01:05.261 --> 01:01:07.763
Burn in hell, freak.

01:01:07.765 --> 01:01:11.199
Burn in... Hell...

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:17.105
I know what to do.

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:34.856
Mr. hill?

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:37.859
I apologize for disturbing you,

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:39.695
but my son, he's very sick.

01:01:39.697 --> 01:01:42.564
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,
Mr....?

01:01:42.566 --> 01:01:44.199
Redman. Adam Redman.

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:47.302
I was on the
Johnny frank Garrett jury.

01:01:47.304 --> 01:01:50.539
And now, as I said,
my son is very sick.

01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:52.507
Well, that's a shame.

01:01:52.509 --> 01:01:54.376
You did Amarillo
a great service.

01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:57.045
I'm sorry to hear you're
having a rough go of it.

01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:59.414
A lot of people
are having a rough go of it.

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:02.217
But I know how we can stop it.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:04.252
Johnny Garrett
didn't get a fair shake.

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:09.191
You want him to get
a fair shake?

01:02:09.193 --> 01:02:11.093
It's done, son.

01:02:11.095 --> 01:02:13.295
You understand?
The bastard's dead.

01:02:13.297 --> 01:02:15.931
No. A part of him isn't.

01:02:15.933 --> 01:02:17.365
Now, look, I'm the last person

01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:19.301
to believe in that
sort of thing, I really am.

01:02:19.303 --> 01:02:21.403
I work hard.
I take care of my family.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:22.904
That is what I believe in.

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:24.406
But this is happening.

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:29.811
He's doing this because
he wants people to know.

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:32.247
To know what?

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:35.250
The church. The fingerprints.
The things you didn't tell us.

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:38.920
The truth. We clear his name,
the curse will break.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:41.289
And my son will get better.

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:45.994
Yeah, see, I understand
what you're saying, boy.

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:49.765
Remember, you was...
You was trying your best.

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:52.868
Hell, we were all
trying our best.

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:55.103
You can believe that.

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.007
You know what?

01:02:59.009 --> 01:03:00.776
Why don't we all go take a walk?

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:02.477
Let's just take
a nice little walk.

01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:04.446
Let's get this
whole mess sorted out.

01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:06.081
You like that?

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:14.489
Ain't no curse, boy.

01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:16.792
It's just bad luck.

01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:19.728
It's not always
about work and family.

01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:22.531
Sometimes you just got to make
yourself good with god.

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:27.369
Then maybe someday
your luck will change.

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:38.880
I'm sorry about your son.

01:05:05.636 --> 01:05:06.835
I'm sorry.

01:05:06.837 --> 01:05:08.403
I need to see father Colvin.

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:11.072
He's in Tulsa.
Left this morning.

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:13.074
I need his help to get
Danny hill to come forward

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:15.410
and tell the truth
about the Johnny Garrett trial.

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:16.611
I know who you are

01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:19.447
and what you're doing here,
Mr. Redman.

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:22.384
Would you mind coming with me?

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.888
Rafael Chago.

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:29.024
He's in prison now.

01:05:29.026 --> 01:05:30.558
In Mcalester, Oklahoma.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.262
He was convicted
five years after Johnny.

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:36.097
He used to live in Amarillo.

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:40.135
This guy, he raped
and killed old women.

01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:42.337
I saw him that night,

01:05:42.339 --> 01:05:46.241
that Halloween night,
creeping outside by the window.

01:05:47.977 --> 01:05:49.544
I told the police.

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.480
They brought him in,

01:05:52.482 --> 01:05:56.451
but they didn't have
any evidence.

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:58.887
No fingerprints.

01:05:58.889 --> 01:06:01.456
With Johnny,
they had fingerprints.

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:05.560
Yeah, but this is the same m.O.
It's the same everything.

01:06:05.562 --> 01:06:07.996
Danny hill just wanted
a conviction.

01:06:07.998 --> 01:06:10.365
I doubt he'll be willing
to admit that.

01:06:10.367 --> 01:06:13.034
Yeah, but with this guy,
I'm gonna make sure he does.

01:06:13.036 --> 01:06:15.837
Johnny's soul wants justice.

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:18.907
The book of Ephesians says,

01:06:18.909 --> 01:06:21.443
"have nothing to do
with darkness,

01:06:21.445 --> 01:06:25.780
but instead expose it
to the light."

01:06:25.782 --> 01:06:27.983
<i>There's just one problem.</i>

01:06:27.985 --> 01:06:33.355
<i>That thing that has a hold
of Johnny now, of his soul,</i>

01:06:33.357 --> 01:06:37.392
<i>it will prefer
to remain in darkness.</i>

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:50.138
Look, I know it doesn't
make any sense.

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:52.874
I don't care about
Johnny frank Garrett.

01:06:52.876 --> 01:06:55.176
I care about Sam.
That's it.

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:58.013
Our son is dying.
He needs his father.

01:06:58.015 --> 01:07:00.081
I need my husband.

01:07:00.083 --> 01:07:02.917
And I'm trying to tell you,
that's why this is happening.

01:07:02.919 --> 01:07:04.386
And I might know how to stop it.

01:07:04.388 --> 01:07:06.454
We got less than 48 hours here.

01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:09.190
I'm just asking you to trust me.

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:12.660
And I'm sorry
you don't understand this.

01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:16.064
Maybe when it's all over
you will.

01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:20.268
Adam.

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:30.612
Adam!

01:07:30.614 --> 01:07:31.813
Adam!

01:07:33.115 --> 01:07:34.716
I want you to have this.

01:07:37.653 --> 01:07:39.521
Take it.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:36.504
What's the matter with you?

01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:39.100
<i>We're good people here.</i>

01:10:39.102 --> 01:10:41.836
<i>Good, god-fearing people.</i>

01:10:41.838 --> 01:10:43.705
<i>We look after each other</i>

01:10:43.707 --> 01:10:48.643
<i>and we look after our community.</i>

01:10:52.015 --> 01:10:54.249
<i>Would you like us to pray again?</i>

01:10:54.251 --> 01:10:55.683
<i>Let's not forget, pal,</i>

01:10:55.685 --> 01:10:57.986
<i>he was spotted in front
of the convent</i>

01:10:57.988 --> 01:11:00.755
<i>the evening of the murder,
and that ain't backwards.</i>

01:11:02.993 --> 01:11:05.627
<i>We look after our community.</i>

01:11:05.629 --> 01:11:08.329
<i>And when that is threatened,
we do something about it.</i>

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:49.637
<i>Rotten grandparents' souls,</i>

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:51.506
<i>and your stinking,
worm-infested</i>

01:11:51.508 --> 01:11:53.141
<i>maggot-ridden ancestors,</i>

01:11:53.143 --> 01:11:55.376
<i>clean back
to the damnable bitch dog</i>

01:11:55.378 --> 01:11:56.944
<i>that began your bitch line.</i>

01:11:56.946 --> 01:11:59.781
<i>I curse every adult,
every person</i>

01:11:59.783 --> 01:12:01.683
<i>that's born after my death</i>

01:12:01.685 --> 01:12:04.786
<i>that is remotely related
to your pitch-infested blood.</i>

01:12:04.788 --> 01:12:06.988
<i>And I will be there
to meet you all.</i>

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:10.825
<i>Damning your souls
to the deepest depths of hell.</i>

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:36.377
I didn't do nothing wrong.

01:13:39.381 --> 01:13:41.983
I have a big family in Cuba.

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:50.625
I am a family man,
and I am with god.

01:13:50.627 --> 01:13:52.527
Oh, yeah, I believe you.

01:13:52.529 --> 01:13:54.996
That you got a family.

01:13:54.998 --> 01:13:56.931
I also believe
that you got a thing

01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:59.100
for raping and killing
old women.

01:14:00.302 --> 01:14:01.936
No.

01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:05.173
My friend Jorge,

01:14:05.175 --> 01:14:07.208
he brags about this.

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:12.146
He tells me he fucks them.

01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:14.315
<i>And they like it.</i>

01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:17.785
<i>They like choking their neck.</i>

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:21.088
They're so old.

01:14:22.892 --> 01:14:25.793
They've forgotten
they can be sinful.

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:28.529
He makes them to remember.

01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:34.602
That guy in your dreams?

01:14:34.604 --> 01:14:37.872
Crazy guy? Long hair?

01:14:37.874 --> 01:14:41.209
Big beard?

01:14:41.211 --> 01:14:43.411
How do you know this man?

01:14:43.413 --> 01:14:45.980
His name is
Johnny frank Garrett.

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:47.882
He was executed
for the rape and killing

01:14:47.884 --> 01:14:50.651
of sister Tadea Benz,
in Amarillo.

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:53.821
But you already know that.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:58.426
Before he died,
something got into him.

01:14:58.428 --> 01:14:59.894
Into his soul.

01:14:59.896 --> 01:15:04.165
The same thing that's coming
after you right now.

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:05.933
The dreams?

01:15:05.935 --> 01:15:08.269
Well, they're just
the beginning.

01:15:08.271 --> 01:15:10.705
I do nothing wrong.

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:13.007
I can stop it.

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:17.745
The dreams,
the sickness, the death.

01:15:17.747 --> 01:15:20.248
But you got to confess.

01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:22.617
Admit what you did,

01:15:22.619 --> 01:15:25.086
so I can clear
Johnny Garrett's name.

01:15:29.492 --> 01:15:31.893
He will have mercy on my soul.

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:33.895
It's not god
you have to worry about.

01:15:33.897 --> 01:15:36.864
See, when you piss off god,

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:40.668
he doesn't come
after your whole family.

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:43.037
Johnny Garrett will.

01:15:45.007 --> 01:15:47.608
You understand what I'm saying?

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:18.372
Give me Danny hill.
Can I tell him who's calling?

01:16:18.374 --> 01:16:19.607
This is Adam Redman.

01:16:19.609 --> 01:16:21.208
Can I tell him
what this is regarding?

01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:23.878
Keeping his lying, crooked ass
out of federal prison.

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:25.479
What the hell
do you want from me?

01:16:25.481 --> 01:16:28.516
<i>My name is Rafael Jose Chago,</i>

01:16:28.518 --> 01:16:29.984
<i>and I can prove</i>

01:16:29.986 --> 01:16:32.753
<i>that Johnny frank Garrett
is innocent.</i>

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:34.922
You're gonna clear
Johnny Garrett's name.

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:36.457
Everyone's gonna know.

01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:39.560
My house. Later tonight.

01:16:39.562 --> 01:16:41.195
Oh, shit.
You're still in Lubbock?

01:16:41.197 --> 01:16:43.598
I'm covering the governor's
re-election campaign.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.832
I need you back in Amarillo.

01:16:44.834 --> 01:16:46.467
I figured out
how to solve the curse.

01:16:46.469 --> 01:16:47.802
You've lost your mind.

01:16:47.804 --> 01:16:49.537
You really want to go
after Danny hill?

01:16:49.539 --> 01:16:51.138
We don't have to go after him.

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:53.007
He's gonna clear
Johnny Garrett himself.

01:16:53.009 --> 01:16:54.408
What are you talking about?

01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:55.610
Meet me at Danny hill's house

01:16:55.612 --> 01:16:57.011
with a camera crew tonight.

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:01.682
- How's Sam?
<i>- He's hanging in there.</i>

01:17:01.684 --> 01:17:03.117
<i>Are you coming home soon?</i>

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:04.852
Yeah, I am.
I'm leaving now.

01:17:04.854 --> 01:17:07.989
<i>Everything's
gonna work out just fine.</i>

01:17:07.991 --> 01:17:09.523
I love you.

01:17:09.525 --> 01:17:12.860
<i>I love you too, baby.</i>

01:20:44.306 --> 01:20:45.673
Mom?

01:20:45.675 --> 01:20:47.942
Hey, champ.

01:20:47.944 --> 01:20:50.377
When's daddy coming back?

01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:52.680
Soon.

01:20:52.682 --> 01:20:54.481
He's coming back soon.

01:20:54.483 --> 01:20:56.217
<i>Reports are coming in</i>

01:20:56.219 --> 01:20:57.985
<i>of a plane crash
just outside Amarillo,</i>

01:20:57.987 --> 01:20:59.386
<i>leaving two people dead.</i>

01:20:59.388 --> 01:21:01.055
<i>The passenger is believed to be</i>

01:21:01.057 --> 01:21:03.557
<i>channel 10 reporter Kathy Jones,</i>

01:21:03.559 --> 01:21:06.126
<i>a respected journalist...</i>

01:21:42.697 --> 01:21:44.531
<i>Hello, son.</i>

01:21:44.533 --> 01:21:46.567
Cigar?

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:49.904
I want you to tell the truth.

01:21:52.475 --> 01:21:54.241
Sam? Nurse!

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:58.145
I want to buy some restaurants.

01:21:58.147 --> 01:22:00.648
Maybe a boss potato or three.

01:22:00.650 --> 01:22:02.416
<i>I'm thinking
half a million a pop.</i>

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:03.784
Help! Help!

01:22:06.656 --> 01:22:08.989
I'm not here to talk
about my restaurants.

01:22:16.565 --> 01:22:17.932
You could send your son

01:22:17.934 --> 01:22:19.667
for the best medical
treatment known to man.

01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:22.002
You'd never have to worry
another day in your life.

01:22:22.004 --> 01:22:24.605
He's coding. Bag him.

01:22:27.342 --> 01:22:28.776
You take that deal.

01:22:28.778 --> 01:22:30.878
It's the American dream, son.

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.246
It's what everybody wants.

01:22:32.248 --> 01:22:34.515
Five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

01:22:34.517 --> 01:22:37.017
That's not what
Johnny Garrett wants.

01:22:37.019 --> 01:22:39.753
You still flapping your jaw
about Johnny?

01:22:39.755 --> 01:22:40.988
Is that what you're doing?

01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:43.457
One, two, three, four, five...

01:22:43.459 --> 01:22:46.226
My son is fighting for his life.

01:22:46.228 --> 01:22:48.462
You screwed the system
to get your conviction.

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:50.397
I'm telling you
to tell the truth.

01:22:50.399 --> 01:22:53.300
Johnny frank Garrett
was born stupid, boy.

01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:54.868
You get that through your head.

01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:57.271
Prep him.

01:22:57.273 --> 01:22:59.073
He was abused by his parents.

01:22:59.075 --> 01:23:00.975
Sexually, physically.

01:23:00.977 --> 01:23:03.010
Strung out on all kind
of fucking drugs.

01:23:03.012 --> 01:23:04.511
He spent hours in his front yard

01:23:04.513 --> 01:23:07.614
just whipping that fucking bush
with a goddamn stick.

01:23:09.452 --> 01:23:11.518
I ain't saying
he was gonna rape a nun,

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:14.688
but that filthy fucking boy
was gonna do something.

01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:16.357
Instead, he...

01:23:16.359 --> 01:23:19.126
He brought comfort
to our little community.

01:23:19.128 --> 01:23:20.728
Peace of mind.

01:23:22.031 --> 01:23:23.330
Now, I'm a firm believer

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:25.733
that everybody has
a purpose in this world.

01:23:25.735 --> 01:23:27.368
And that was Johnny's purpose.

01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:28.369
Clear.

01:23:28.371 --> 01:23:29.670
You can't play god like that.

01:23:29.672 --> 01:23:31.972
Maybe even god
shouldn't play god.

01:23:31.974 --> 01:23:33.540
Because, going by
your standards,

01:23:33.542 --> 01:23:35.909
he shit the bed a little
too often anyway, didn't he?

01:23:35.911 --> 01:23:38.078
Why don't you just
go ask poor Johnny.

01:23:39.281 --> 01:23:40.914
Everybody got pain.

01:23:40.916 --> 01:23:42.449
You ain't the only one.

01:23:42.451 --> 01:23:44.518
You just got to suck
that shit up and live with it.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.653
I am asking you
to do the right thing.

01:23:46.655 --> 01:23:48.956
To end this right now.

01:23:48.958 --> 01:23:50.557
What do you want me to do, boy?

01:23:50.559 --> 01:23:52.593
What the fuck
do you want me to do?

01:23:53.863 --> 01:23:55.195
You think an apology gonna mean

01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:56.630
one hell of a difference here?

01:23:56.632 --> 01:23:58.132
He's dead!
Again.

01:23:58.134 --> 01:24:00.901
You could make this stop.
Right now!

01:24:00.903 --> 01:24:02.503
Well, there you go!

01:24:02.505 --> 01:24:07.241
Now finally, you and I see
eye to eye on something here!

01:24:07.243 --> 01:24:08.675
You fucking crazy?

01:24:08.677 --> 01:24:11.245
No more than normal, boy,
but the night is young.

01:24:11.247 --> 01:24:12.446
Clear.

01:24:12.448 --> 01:24:15.816
You stalked me for far too long.

01:24:15.818 --> 01:24:19.353
And this shit ends tonight.

01:24:19.355 --> 01:24:20.954
Again.

01:24:30.633 --> 01:24:31.832
Clear!

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:36.837
No!

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:51.418
What are you...? What?

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.120
No.
I'm sorry.

01:24:53.122 --> 01:24:55.656
No! No!

01:24:55.658 --> 01:24:57.991
No, Sam! Sam!

01:24:57.993 --> 01:24:59.893
Sam! Get off me!

01:24:59.895 --> 01:25:02.196
Sam. Sam, wake up, baby.

01:25:02.198 --> 01:25:03.864
Get off of me!

01:25:05.101 --> 01:25:06.300
Wake up, baby.

01:25:06.302 --> 01:25:07.935
Wake up. You're okay.

01:25:07.937 --> 01:25:09.670
You're okay. Wake up.

01:25:09.672 --> 01:25:12.806
Wake up. Wake up.

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:15.609
Wake up, baby.

01:25:15.611 --> 01:25:18.745
Sam. Sam.

01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:28.589
<i>No. No.</i>

01:26:07.395 --> 01:26:11.064
I should have done
more to help you.

01:26:11.066 --> 01:26:14.468
You were innocent.

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:17.871
But so is my son.

01:26:20.275 --> 01:26:22.709
Whatever comes next,

01:26:22.711 --> 01:26:24.912
if you hurt him,

01:26:24.914 --> 01:26:27.447
I will fight you.

01:26:27.449 --> 01:26:31.852
And I will never
stop fighting you.

01:27:10.658 --> 01:27:11.992
Mom?

01:27:13.962 --> 01:27:15.395
Sam.

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:16.897
Sam. Oh, my god.

01:27:16.899 --> 01:27:19.166
Sam, you're okay.

01:27:19.168 --> 01:27:21.268
Oh, god, Sam!

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:26.840
Oh, my god.

01:27:26.842 --> 01:27:28.342
Oh, my god.

01:27:28.344 --> 01:27:30.844
Oh, thank god.

01:27:32.081 --> 01:27:33.313
Oh, Sam.

01:28:49.557 --> 01:28:51.191
This is the bread

01:28:51.193 --> 01:28:53.493
which cometh down from heaven,

01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:57.030
that a man may eat thereof,
and not die.

01:28:57.032 --> 01:29:01.401
I am the living bread
which came down from heaven.

01:29:01.403 --> 01:29:04.805
If any man eat of this bread...

01:29:22.323 --> 01:29:26.159
If any man eat of this bread...

01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:28.495
He shall live forever.

01:29:31.467 --> 01:29:33.700
Lara. Sam.

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:35.001
Hi, father.

01:29:35.003 --> 01:29:37.170
That was a really good
service, father.

01:29:37.172 --> 01:29:39.873
It made me think, you know?

01:29:42.377 --> 01:29:44.010
Is everything okay?

01:29:45.646 --> 01:29:48.248
Good. Good.
I'm a little tired, that's all.

01:29:48.250 --> 01:29:50.917
Haven't been sleeping well.

01:29:50.919 --> 01:29:54.087
Well, if you ever need
someone to talk to,

01:29:54.089 --> 01:29:55.889
you know where I am.

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:23.877
<i>I have been charged,</i>

01:31:23.879 --> 01:31:26.480
<i>convicted, sentenced
and more than punished</i>

01:31:26.482 --> 01:31:28.215
<i>for rape and murder.</i>

01:31:28.217 --> 01:31:31.084
<i>And a lot of real bad stuff
has been said about me that,</i>

01:31:31.086 --> 01:31:32.586
<i>if given the chance,</i>

01:31:32.588 --> 01:31:35.822
<i>I could have proven not only
beyond a reasonable doubt,</i>

01:31:35.824 --> 01:31:38.925
<i>but beyond any doubt
of my innocence.</i>

01:31:38.927 --> 01:31:43.830
<i>But you, society, did not
give me a chance to do so.</i>

01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:46.700
<i>I never really
went to school, as you did.</i>

01:31:46.702 --> 01:31:49.302
<i>I didn't learn to read there,
as you did.</i>

01:31:49.304 --> 01:31:50.937
<i>I learned at home.</i>

01:31:50.939 --> 01:31:53.039
<i>And because of that,
I spent over half my life</i>

01:31:53.041 --> 01:31:55.242
<i>in juvenile and adult
institutions,</i>

01:31:55.244 --> 01:31:58.445
<i>detention centers,
halfway houses, state schools,</i>

01:31:58.447 --> 01:32:02.182
<i>jails with grown men,
all before my 19th birthday.</i>

01:32:02.184 --> 01:32:03.917
<i>You people...</i>

01:32:03.919 --> 01:32:06.186
<i>I despise every one of you,</i>

01:32:06.188 --> 01:32:10.390
<i>from the government
to the ignorant judge and jury.</i>

01:32:10.392 --> 01:32:12.225
<i>The Das, the media.</i>

01:32:12.227 --> 01:32:16.096
<i>And especially you,
cowardly society.</i>

01:32:16.098 --> 01:32:18.798
<i>You think you can kill me?
You can't kill me.</i>

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:20.967
<i>I was born dead.</i>

01:32:20.969 --> 01:32:22.969
<i>I will live on in the love</i>

01:32:22.971 --> 01:32:26.239
<i>that is within my family and
friends and their descendants.</i>

01:32:26.241 --> 01:32:29.743
<i>And I will live
in your deepest fears.</i>

01:32:29.745 --> 01:32:31.711
<i>I am your fear.</i>

01:32:31.713 --> 01:32:34.314
<i>You fear me, because I am
what you hate:</i>

01:32:34.316 --> 01:32:35.849
<i>Yourself.</i>

01:32:35.851 --> 01:32:38.084
<i>When you judge me,
you only judged yourself,</i>

01:32:38.086 --> 01:32:40.620
<i>for I am a reflection
of you, society.</i>

01:32:40.622 --> 01:32:43.857
<i>Your rotten flesh fears me
because when you see me,</i>

01:32:43.859 --> 01:32:47.193
<i>you see something dark
and perverted and twisted,</i>

01:32:47.195 --> 01:32:50.397
<i>which became so because of you,
society.</i>

01:32:50.399 --> 01:32:53.567
<i>You think you can scare me
with death.</i>

01:32:53.569 --> 01:32:55.735
<i>I've faced death before.</i>

01:32:55.737 --> 01:32:58.371
<i>I'm resigned to death.</i>

01:32:58.373 --> 01:32:59.773
<i>All people die.</i>

01:32:59.775 --> 01:33:01.308
<i>I know that if I die,</i>

01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:03.877
<i>I'm going to die
with a clear conscience,</i>

01:33:03.879 --> 01:33:06.313
<i>a whole spirit, and as a man.</i>

01:33:06.315 --> 01:33:10.951
<i>But you, society,
will live in shame.</i>

01:33:10.953 --> 01:33:13.954
<i>In your nightmares I will live.</i>

01:33:13.956 --> 01:33:17.324
<i>In your times of fear,
big or small, will I be.</i>

01:33:17.326 --> 01:33:20.961
<i>Every frustration in your lives
will be me.</i>

01:33:20.963 --> 01:33:23.430
<i>Every death of your families
will be me.</i>

01:33:23.432 --> 01:33:25.832
<i>I will be the one
to meet your family's souls.</i>

01:33:25.834 --> 01:33:28.368
<i>I will be the fear
you will experience</i>

01:33:28.370 --> 01:33:30.003
<i>upon your last breath.</i>

01:33:30.005 --> 01:33:33.239
<i>I curse your souls
to the deepest depths</i>

01:33:33.241 --> 01:33:34.874
<i>of your own hell.</i>

01:33:34.876 --> 01:33:37.310
<i>And I curse your parents' souls
to the same hell,</i>

01:33:37.312 --> 01:33:39.279
<i>and your rotten
grandparents' souls,</i>

01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:41.047
<i>and your stinking,
worm-infested,</i>

01:33:41.049 --> 01:33:42.849
<i>maggot-ridden ancestors,</i>

01:33:42.851 --> 01:33:46.453
<i>clean back to the damnable dog
that began your line.</i>

01:33:46.455 --> 01:33:48.188
<i>I curse every adult,</i>

01:33:48.190 --> 01:33:50.991
<i>every person that's born
after my death</i>

01:33:50.993 --> 01:33:54.961
<i>that is remotely related
to your pitch-infested blood.</i>

01:33:54.963 --> 01:33:58.231
<i>And because I know the curses
will be fulfilled,</i>

01:33:58.233 --> 01:34:03.403
<i>I meet death in a better spirit
and stronger soul.</i>

01:34:03.405 --> 01:34:05.739
<i>Johnny frank Garrett.</i>
