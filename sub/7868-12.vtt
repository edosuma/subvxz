00:22.352 --> 00:25.721
Okay kids, time to apply the
final "date night" touch.

00:25.789 --> 00:29.024
Lisa, spray just a hint
of perfume on my neck.

00:29.092 --> 00:31.861
Bart, you tell me this dress
doesn't make me look fat.

00:31.928 --> 00:33.395
And now!

00:33.463 --> 00:34.797
(mist spritzing) you don't look fat.

00:34.865 --> 00:35.998
Thank you!

00:36.066 --> 00:37.600
(bird squawks)

00:37.667 --> 00:39.768
(spritzing) homer, you don't look fat.

00:39.836 --> 00:41.036
(chuckling): Oh, carl!

00:41.104 --> 00:43.672
You're a liar, but I love it.

00:43.740 --> 00:45.908
Date night: It's the embalming fluid

00:45.976 --> 00:47.977
That keeps the mummy of a marriage fresh

00:48.044 --> 00:49.111
After the heart and brain have been

00:49.179 --> 00:50.746
Pulled out through the nose.

00:50.814 --> 00:54.683
Ugh, I never should've given
you that egyptology book.

00:54.751 --> 00:57.820
Gentlemen, I'm afraid we've
detected a small leak

00:57.888 --> 01:00.055
Somewhere in the heavy
water piping facility.

01:00.123 --> 01:03.158
Don't leave until you find that leak!

01:03.226 --> 01:04.959
Uh, mr. Burns, couldn't we
patch the leak tomorrow?

01:05.028 --> 01:06.495
It's date night.

01:06.563 --> 01:07.830
Oh, indeed it is.

01:07.898 --> 01:09.899
Tonight I will be continuing my courtship

01:09.966 --> 01:12.268
Of princess wilhelmina of prussia.

01:12.335 --> 01:13.602
(whimpers)

01:13.670 --> 01:15.738
Tonight's the night I pop the question:

01:15.805 --> 01:18.040
Where is the kaiser's gold?

01:18.108 --> 01:19.642
Now get to work on that leak!

01:22.546 --> 01:24.413
(sighs disconsolately)

01:27.450 --> 01:30.686
<i>Tv announcer: We now return to:</i>

01:30.754 --> 01:34.256
Angelo stood me up on date night,
so I showed him:

01:34.324 --> 01:36.825
I had one of my boobs reduced.

01:36.893 --> 01:39.361
You're one smart cookie, rosemary.

01:39.429 --> 01:41.497
That left boob was too good for him.

01:41.565 --> 01:42.631
(clink)

01:42.699 --> 01:44.166
Housewife: We're appalling!

01:44.234 --> 01:45.367
(tv turns off)

01:45.435 --> 01:47.202
I'm sorry I missed dinner, honey.

01:47.270 --> 01:48.704
We still have time to catch a movie.

01:48.772 --> 01:51.006
That can be romantic. Really?

01:51.074 --> 01:51.540
How romantic?

01:52.809 --> 01:54.677
It'll make a walk on the beach

01:54.744 --> 01:57.012
Seem like a punch in the face.

01:57.080 --> 01:58.380
Whoa!

02:00.784 --> 02:02.751
Did you call the furnace man?

02:02.819 --> 02:05.521
You said you were gonna call him!
He's your cousin!

02:05.589 --> 02:06.855
Well, maybe we can just
get through (chewing ice)

02:06.923 --> 02:08.223
The winter without heat. (cell phone rings)

02:08.291 --> 02:09.858
Guess I'll have to take care of this

02:09.925 --> 02:11.860
Like I took care of your
speeding tickets! (crunching ice)

02:11.928 --> 02:14.930
(sighs) it's so noisy in here.

02:14.998 --> 02:17.800
I can't hear the ad telling
everyone to be quiet!

02:17.867 --> 02:19.435
Hey, we came here to enjoy the movie,

02:19.502 --> 02:21.003
And we're going to enjoy the movie.

02:22.272 --> 02:23.739
We're out of here.

02:23.807 --> 02:26.175
This isn't fair; I want romance.

02:26.242 --> 02:27.509
How about bromance?

02:27.577 --> 02:28.677
It's not the same.

02:28.745 --> 02:29.712
Dude...

02:29.779 --> 02:32.147
I'm not a dude, I'm a hottie.

02:32.215 --> 02:35.517
This bromance just got interesting.

02:35.585 --> 02:36.885
(groans, gasps)

02:36.953 --> 02:39.054
Ooh, ice skating.

02:39.122 --> 02:41.824
A sport that encourages hand-holding.

02:41.891 --> 02:45.027
Would you like to wear
mittens or go commando?

02:45.095 --> 02:46.762
Oh! (giggling)

02:47.964 --> 02:49.098
Oh!

02:49.165 --> 02:52.568
Why not? Sorry, no skating tonight.

02:55.071 --> 02:57.406
What, they come here on
Saturday night to clean the ice?

02:57.474 --> 02:58.707
Losers.

02:58.775 --> 03:00.209
Actually, it's called "curling."

03:00.276 --> 03:03.012
Players slide the heavy stones
toward the circle, or "house,"

03:03.079 --> 03:05.347
As teammates control the
direction and speed of the stone

03:05.415 --> 03:08.050
By sweeping in front of
it with a special broom.

03:08.118 --> 03:10.653
Marge, this is perfect for both of us!

03:10.720 --> 03:13.088
It's got bowling for me
and sweeping for you.

03:13.156 --> 03:15.024
Maybe you'd like to give it a try?

03:15.091 --> 03:16.959
Mm... Hmm.

03:18.461 --> 03:21.030
Let us curl, milady.

03:21.097 --> 03:22.731
Let us throw and sweep a'twain

03:22.799 --> 03:24.299
Until the heavens themselves

03:24.367 --> 03:26.435
Drop their jaws in wonder and envy!

03:26.503 --> 03:29.004
And afterwards there'll be beer and cocoa,

03:29.072 --> 03:30.773
With marshmallows floating in the foam.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.442
And if, from now till the end of time,

03:33.510 --> 03:35.644
Someone should ask what we were doing

03:35.712 --> 03:37.680
On the eve of the 17th of November,

03:37.747 --> 03:40.215
We shall proclaim that

03:40.283 --> 03:43.919
We... Were... Curling!

03:43.987 --> 03:46.855
This is what you're like
when you don't drink!

03:46.923 --> 03:49.758
(orchestral waltz playing)

03:51.000 --> 03:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:12.348 --> 04:14.183
Young woman.

04:14.250 --> 04:15.751
Where'd you learn to sweep like that?

04:15.819 --> 04:17.853
I've been training all my life.

04:17.921 --> 04:20.956
I once swept red wine off a white carpet.

04:21.024 --> 04:22.291
I like your style, blue.

04:22.358 --> 04:23.826
Want to join our team?

04:23.893 --> 04:25.461
If homer can join with me.

04:25.528 --> 04:27.496
Fine. You two are off the team.

04:27.564 --> 04:29.264
I see.

04:29.332 --> 04:32.668
Well, I guess we can return
these bodysuits to the store.

04:32.736 --> 04:34.770
Hmm.

04:34.838 --> 04:37.306
So, we'd just thrown a biter,

04:37.373 --> 04:39.308
And homer said to kick harder off the hack.

04:39.375 --> 04:42.544
So I did and I almost fouled the hog line!

04:42.612 --> 04:43.846
(laughing)

04:43.913 --> 04:45.514
Exciting, exciting.

04:45.582 --> 04:48.217
I just have one question:
Is curling a real thing?

04:48.284 --> 04:50.953
Yeah, or is it just a cover
story for a grown-up thing

04:51.020 --> 04:52.387
We're not allowed to know about?

04:52.455 --> 04:53.822
Yeah, like the time you said

04:53.890 --> 04:55.924
Dad was taking a weekend leadership seminar,

04:55.992 --> 04:57.960
When he was really stuck in
a barrel at the junkyard?

04:58.027 --> 04:59.795
Curling is real.

04:59.863 --> 05:02.631
The realest thing I've ever done.

05:02.699 --> 05:04.099
(doorbell rings)

05:04.167 --> 05:05.033
Hmm.

05:06.169 --> 05:07.302
(gulps)

05:07.370 --> 05:08.403
Principal skinner?!

05:08.471 --> 05:09.938
This is bogus, man.

05:10.006 --> 05:11.740
You know the rules:
Two letters and a conference

05:11.808 --> 05:13.442
Before I get a home visit.

05:13.510 --> 05:14.910
Bart, my cargo pants indicate

05:14.978 --> 05:16.845
That I'm not here on school business.

05:16.913 --> 05:19.348
I'm here on "cool" business, I.E. Curling.

05:19.415 --> 05:22.785
<i>Hey, look who slid into our house.</i>

05:22.852 --> 05:25.320
(chuckling) great curling reference.

05:25.388 --> 05:26.722
What's up, seymour?

05:26.790 --> 05:28.724
Astonishing news out of
eau claire, wisconsin.

05:28.792 --> 05:30.993
The olympic committee has
announced that mixed curling

05:31.060 --> 05:33.195
Will be a demonstration event
at the winter olympics.

05:33.263 --> 05:35.664
There's a winter olympics?

05:42.705 --> 05:45.340
(laughing)

05:45.408 --> 05:48.110
Homer, while you were imagining
what the winter olympics were,

05:48.178 --> 05:52.014
Seymour said we were all
going to the olympic trials!

05:52.081 --> 05:55.250
Olympic trials, eh?

05:55.318 --> 05:58.153
He usually stays out like
this for about 30 seconds.

05:58.221 --> 05:59.321
Want some coffee?

05:59.389 --> 06:00.589
Mmm, that'd be great.

06:04.419 --> 06:05.887
Terrible, seymour!

06:05.955 --> 06:08.357
You're a disgrace to frozen water!

06:08.424 --> 06:09.758
You love your son.

06:09.826 --> 06:11.493
How can you be so hard on him?

06:11.561 --> 06:15.197
Marge, love has nothing to do with winning.

06:15.264 --> 06:17.366
Believe me, I know.

06:17.433 --> 06:22.571
<i>I was in love with a soldier boy,
on leave from korea.</i>

06:22.638 --> 06:25.307
<i>It was a 50's style romance--</i>

06:25.375 --> 06:27.476
<i>Three minutes of sex and a
lifetime of regret.</i>

06:30.013 --> 06:34.282
<i>He went back to his war, and I went back to
my dream:</i>

06:34.350 --> 06:36.752
<i>Pole vaulting in the
helsinki olympics.</i>

06:36.819 --> 06:39.054
<i>But there was a bump in the road...</i>

06:39.122 --> 06:41.990
<i>A bump named seymour!</i>

06:42.058 --> 06:43.492
<i>The whole nine months,</i>

06:43.559 --> 06:45.260
<i>Seymour had just laid
there like a lump.</i>

06:45.328 --> 06:47.362
<i>Then this pre-natal nitwit</i>

06:47.430 --> 06:49.464
<i>Decides to do his rockettes
impression.</i>

06:52.568 --> 06:53.535
(all sigh with relief)

06:53.603 --> 06:55.971
<i>Before he was even born,</i>

06:56.039 --> 06:58.540
<i>He ruined my life.</i>

06:58.608 --> 07:01.743
Yes, that involuntary pre-conscious reflex

07:01.811 --> 07:04.579
I made in utero was unforgivable.

07:04.647 --> 07:06.081
The point is, don't let your feelings

07:06.149 --> 07:07.916
Get in the way of winning.

07:07.984 --> 07:10.719
They don't give out medals
for being a loving wife.

07:10.787 --> 07:11.987
Well, they should.

07:12.055 --> 07:13.221
Well, they don't!

07:15.591 --> 07:17.659
(barking)

07:17.727 --> 07:18.827
(fussing)

07:18.895 --> 07:22.831
(snoring and snorting)

07:22.899 --> 07:24.699
(grunting)

07:24.767 --> 07:26.601
(guzzling)

07:26.669 --> 07:28.236
(jabbering)

07:28.304 --> 07:30.605
Oh, wise guys, eh?

07:30.673 --> 07:33.141
(slapping)

07:33.209 --> 07:34.576
Homer: Sweep, sweep.

07:34.644 --> 07:36.278
Left, right, left, right, back and forth.

07:36.345 --> 07:38.246
(humming)

07:38.314 --> 07:39.281
Hmm?

07:39.348 --> 07:40.949
Excuse me?

07:41.017 --> 07:43.051
I think this fell off your hat.

07:43.119 --> 07:45.120
Oh, thanks! That's chilbert.

07:45.188 --> 07:47.355
One of the four winter games mascots.

07:47.423 --> 07:48.924
Would you like it? I've got doubles.

07:48.991 --> 07:51.059
Thank you.

07:51.127 --> 07:55.564
Just beware, collecting olympic
pins can be kind of addictive.

07:55.631 --> 07:59.634
(chuckles) come on, they're just pins.

07:59.702 --> 08:00.869
(chuckling)

08:00.937 --> 08:03.371
He does look lonely all by himself.

08:04.841 --> 08:06.241
(gasps) oh!

08:06.309 --> 08:08.276
Buy us!

08:08.344 --> 08:10.879
Buy us with money!

08:10.947 --> 08:12.581
One labatty, please.

08:16.119 --> 08:19.054
(chuckling) looks like
we hooked another one.

08:19.122 --> 08:21.156
(hoarse male voice): Please let
me go back to the cruise ship.

08:21.224 --> 08:22.924
I was chief purser.

08:22.992 --> 08:26.294
Never! Now get back in character,
monsieur wee wee.

08:26.362 --> 08:28.697
Someday I'll be the tall guy.

08:28.764 --> 08:30.565
¶ ¶

08:41.510 --> 08:43.445
All dad needs to do is put his stone

08:43.513 --> 08:45.247
Inside that circle and they win.

08:47.850 --> 08:50.619
Oh, my god, dad threw too hard!

08:55.791 --> 08:57.759
That stone is coming in like a rocket.

08:57.827 --> 09:00.095
It's gotta be going four,
maybe five miles an hour!

09:01.898 --> 09:05.000
Someone needs to convert that
kinetic energy back into potential.

09:22.018 --> 09:22.884
(cheering)

09:22.952 --> 09:25.754
Homie, we're going to vancouver!

09:25.821 --> 09:27.189
Pack your winter coat.

09:27.256 --> 09:29.658
We're going to canada's warmest city!

09:42.635 --> 09:43.835
Homer, who's that?

09:43.903 --> 09:45.270
She used to be my therapist.

09:45.338 --> 09:49.040
(beatboxing-like chant) (guttural chanting)

09:57.083 --> 09:58.517
(chanting continues)

09:58.584 --> 09:59.484
(chanting stops)

09:59.552 --> 10:01.453
How can I ever thank you?

10:01.521 --> 10:02.854
Pay your bill!

10:02.922 --> 10:03.989
I couldn't hear the last thing you said!

10:04.056 --> 10:05.290
Good-bye forever!

10:05.358 --> 10:08.560
Bob costas at the 2010 vancouver games.

10:08.628 --> 10:11.163
For the beijing games,
china picked famed director

10:11.230 --> 10:13.865
Zhang yimou to stage its opening ceremony.

10:13.933 --> 10:16.968
<i>Tonight, canada turns to its
most famous director:</i>

10:17.036 --> 10:20.338
<i>Ivan reitman, the man who
brought us ghostbusters.</i>

10:20.406 --> 10:22.908
Announcer (over pa): Who you gonna call?

10:22.975 --> 10:24.910
Albania!

10:24.977 --> 10:26.411
Who you gonna call?

10:26.479 --> 10:28.380
Algeria!

10:28.447 --> 10:30.015
Who you gonna call?

10:30.082 --> 10:31.783
Argentina!

10:31.851 --> 10:33.385
(wearily and hoarsely): Who you gonna call?

10:33.452 --> 10:35.687
Zimbabwe.

10:35.755 --> 10:38.190
And now, not competing but observing:

10:38.257 --> 10:39.624
Who you gonna call?

10:39.692 --> 10:41.626
Angola.

10:41.694 --> 10:44.863
(drumroll, cheering)

10:44.931 --> 10:48.099
Bob costas: And now, in the olympic
spirit of peace and goodwill,

10:48.167 --> 10:50.569
We release the canadian dove,

10:50.636 --> 10:52.604
The beaver!

10:54.807 --> 10:57.309
(squeaking)

11:00.613 --> 11:02.247
This was all preventable!

11:05.818 --> 11:07.385
Hey, lis, want to come with?

11:07.453 --> 11:08.887
I'm snowboarding

11:08.955 --> 11:10.555
With my new canadian friend, milhoose.

11:10.623 --> 11:13.658
Hey, bort, your sister's hotter
than a calgary brushfire.

11:13.726 --> 11:15.260
Mind if I ask her oot?

11:15.328 --> 11:16.795
Sorry, but I was planning

11:16.862 --> 11:18.496
To stop by the olympic pin center

11:18.564 --> 11:20.799
To fill in a few small
gaps in my collection.

11:20.866 --> 11:22.801
You know, just to get me through the day.

11:22.868 --> 11:25.904
She's as loony as a one-dollar coin.

11:25.972 --> 11:28.506
Hey, hoser, want some canadian club?

11:28.574 --> 11:29.874
Do I?!

11:29.942 --> 11:32.310
Oh! Hoo-hoo!

11:32.378 --> 11:34.579
(to tune of "old macdonald") ¶ oh,
a pork bao ¶

11:34.647 --> 11:36.748
¶ a shrimp bao, everywhere a bao bao ¶

11:36.816 --> 11:41.019
¶ homer simpson wins a gold,
sliding rocks on ice, bao bao! ¶

11:41.087 --> 11:43.555
Marge, we need to talk about your husband.

11:43.623 --> 11:44.956
Oh, my favorite subject.

11:45.024 --> 11:47.025
I'll go first. Isn't he cute?

11:47.093 --> 11:48.593
A little.

11:48.661 --> 11:50.762
But as an olympic curler,
he's dragging us down

11:50.830 --> 11:52.664
Like an anchor on a bag of toasters.

11:52.732 --> 11:53.798
Hmm?

11:53.866 --> 11:55.867
But homer tries his best.

11:55.935 --> 11:57.836
We know. That's why we're positive

11:57.903 --> 11:59.704
He'll never get any better.

11:59.772 --> 12:02.907
I had one olympics ruined by a bald,
drooling idiot,

12:02.975 --> 12:04.476
But it's not gonna happen again.

12:04.543 --> 12:06.144
I was not bald.

12:06.212 --> 12:07.679
My fontanel was covered by lanugo.

12:07.747 --> 12:09.180
Whatever.

12:09.248 --> 12:10.582
We want homer off the team.

12:10.650 --> 12:12.484
Well, who made you the coach?

12:12.551 --> 12:14.419
The hat makes me the coach.

12:14.487 --> 12:18.790
Well, homer's my soul mate,
and you don't dump a soul mate.

12:18.858 --> 12:20.925
Oh, my god, I'm holding back the team.

12:20.993 --> 12:22.927
But our marriage is based on curling.

12:22.995 --> 12:25.263
Oh, what am I gonna do?

12:25.331 --> 12:26.364
Hmm...

12:30.903 --> 12:32.170
Hmm...

12:35.641 --> 12:37.409
Hmm...

12:41.180 --> 12:42.480
Hmm.

12:42.548 --> 12:43.615
Mm.

12:48.254 --> 12:50.188
(gaping in awe)

12:50.256 --> 12:50.755
(gasps)

12:50.823 --> 12:52.490
Oh, my gosh.

12:52.558 --> 12:55.193
It's the mascot from the
1924 games in chamonix.

12:55.261 --> 12:56.861
That's right.

12:56.929 --> 12:58.730
It's ennui, himself.

12:58.798 --> 13:00.398
I must have him.

13:00.466 --> 13:02.167
Um... Can I have it on account?

13:02.234 --> 13:03.635
On account of I want it?

13:03.703 --> 13:05.103
(laughs)

13:05.171 --> 13:06.738
You've heard that one, huh?

13:06.806 --> 13:08.807
No, it's just not funny the first time.

13:08.874 --> 13:10.975
But if you want to trade, I could take--

13:11.043 --> 13:13.712
Uh, oh, I don't know-
those pearls you're wearing.

13:13.779 --> 13:15.146
My pearls?

13:15.214 --> 13:16.881
These were a gift from my mom

13:16.949 --> 13:19.284
When I could first read
at a twelfth grade level.

13:19.352 --> 13:21.252
You want to yak, or you want to trade?

13:21.320 --> 13:23.488
(whimpers) just take them.

13:24.924 --> 13:26.324
(laughs)

13:30.730 --> 13:34.032
(jazzy saxophone music)

13:38.904 --> 13:41.072
I saw you grooving to the beat.

13:41.140 --> 13:42.640
You got to pay for that.

13:42.708 --> 13:44.142
Lis, what's going on?

13:44.210 --> 13:45.744
You're not normally this interesting.

13:45.811 --> 13:47.212
Nothing's going on.

13:47.279 --> 13:48.713
Just sharing my music

13:48.781 --> 13:50.348
With the good people of vancouver.

13:50.416 --> 13:51.883
A dime?!

13:51.951 --> 13:54.986
What do you think I am-
a payphone from 1980?!

13:55.054 --> 13:56.955
Are you sure you're okay?

13:57.022 --> 13:58.656
I'm fine.

13:58.724 --> 14:00.992
Fine, fine, fine, fine,
fine, fine, fine, fine.

14:01.060 --> 14:02.827
What's that noise?

14:02.895 --> 14:05.630
Your dress is covered with pins.

14:05.698 --> 14:06.898
There is no dress.

14:06.966 --> 14:08.366
It's just pins.

14:08.434 --> 14:09.768
(crying)

14:09.835 --> 14:11.035
Help me?

14:16.976 --> 14:19.511
(explosion)

14:19.578 --> 14:22.647
What are you doing? I like to warm up.

14:22.715 --> 14:24.282
By sweeping behind the snack bar.

14:24.350 --> 14:25.817
Boo yeah!

14:25.885 --> 14:27.485
Well, no matter what you do,

14:27.553 --> 14:30.155
It won't make up for sir sli
p-a-lot over there.

14:30.222 --> 14:32.757
(grunting)

14:32.825 --> 14:34.092
Uh-oh.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.860
Yes, it will.

14:35.928 --> 14:38.430
I'll just sweep harder than
anyone's ever swept before.

14:38.497 --> 14:40.899
Because without homer,
I'm a broom without a stone.

14:40.966 --> 14:43.735
No use for anything.

14:43.803 --> 14:46.504
Wow. That's love, seymour.

14:46.572 --> 14:49.541
I'm glad you saw it once before you died.

14:49.608 --> 14:52.777
Bob costas: If homer simpson doesn't
land this stone in center house,

14:52.845 --> 14:54.579
The only gold they'll be going home with

14:54.647 --> 14:55.980
Is lisa's pin collection.

14:56.048 --> 14:57.515
That tidbit courtesy

14:57.583 --> 14:59.317
Of our highly paid intern, tom brokaw.

14:59.385 --> 15:02.187
I love to learn about lisa.

15:07.293 --> 15:10.829
Costas: Oh, my, that delivery has
less juice than sunny delight.

15:10.896 --> 15:12.564
(audience sighing)

15:12.631 --> 15:14.599
Marge simpson is sweeping fast and clean,

15:14.667 --> 15:16.868
But it won't be enough.

15:16.936 --> 15:18.369
I've never seen this before.

15:18.437 --> 15:22.207
Marge simpson is trying to restart a stone.

15:22.274 --> 15:23.875
Come on, baby! She did it!

15:23.943 --> 15:25.643
She pulled off an impossible move,

15:25.711 --> 15:28.213
Just like the time I shaved
off larry bird's moustache

15:28.280 --> 15:29.814
While he was napping.

15:29.882 --> 15:31.316
(soft grunting)

15:31.383 --> 15:32.684
(loud pop) aah!

15:32.751 --> 15:34.752
(cheering)

15:38.324 --> 15:40.124
Team u.S.A. Heads to the gold medal match.

15:40.192 --> 15:41.526
But wait a minute.

15:41.594 --> 15:43.061
Marge simpson looks hurt.

15:43.128 --> 15:45.330
This is the sort of bittersweet melodrama

15:45.397 --> 15:47.031
Olympic coverage feeds on.

15:47.099 --> 15:48.766
I admit it.

15:48.834 --> 15:51.035
We're vampires who suck on shattered dreams.

15:51.103 --> 15:52.337
That's my marge!

15:52.404 --> 15:54.339
High five. Hold on a sec.

15:54.406 --> 15:56.207
Marge, let me look at that shoulder.

15:56.275 --> 15:57.642
(winces) hmm. Sorry, but

15:57.710 --> 15:59.811
I'm afraid she'll never curl again.

15:59.879 --> 16:02.547
That looks like the end of team usa's dream.

16:02.615 --> 16:05.183
It appears team sweden will clinch the gold,

16:05.251 --> 16:07.619
And they are over the moon with joy.

16:07.686 --> 16:10.421
Joy is but the shadow pain casts.

16:20.342 --> 16:21.744
Can I help you with that?

16:21.811 --> 16:23.445
I'll do it myself.

16:23.513 --> 16:25.014
When we do things together,

16:25.081 --> 16:27.283
They always turn out badly... For me.

16:27.350 --> 16:29.351
Ooh, you're hot when you're horny.

16:29.419 --> 16:32.054
I'm not horny. I'm mad.

16:32.122 --> 16:34.189
Ooh, you're mad when you're angry.

16:34.257 --> 16:35.591
(angry grunt)

16:37.160 --> 16:39.728
Marge, you're really
good with your left hand.

16:39.796 --> 16:41.463
I should be. I'm left-handed.

16:41.531 --> 16:43.832
I've been using my right
hand all these years

16:43.900 --> 16:46.302
'cause I didn't want to
seem unusual in any way.

16:51.708 --> 16:53.208
Hmm.

16:54.844 --> 16:56.679
Lisa, I know everything about addiction

16:56.746 --> 16:58.514
That you can learn from watching dad.

16:58.581 --> 17:00.783
The first thing you have to do is get clean,

17:00.850 --> 17:02.518
So give me your pins.

17:02.585 --> 17:05.154
All of 'em. What is this, tough love?

17:05.221 --> 17:07.388
Uh, it's a little more like soft hate.

17:11.060 --> 17:13.494
I said, all of them.

17:13.563 --> 17:15.731
(sighs) oh.

17:18.768 --> 17:20.069
And now, just put your pearls back on,

17:20.136 --> 17:21.502
And we'll go get some coffee.

17:21.570 --> 17:22.972
It's not that easy, bart.

17:23.039 --> 17:24.940
I...

17:25.008 --> 17:26.508
Traded away my pearls.

17:26.576 --> 17:28.109
Oh. (cries)

17:28.178 --> 17:30.813
Without them, I'm just a big maggie.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.016
(sobbing)

17:56.106 --> 17:58.407
What'll you take for the pearls?

17:58.475 --> 17:59.509
Nothing you got, junior.

17:59.576 --> 18:00.977
Really?

18:01.044 --> 18:02.678
Not even this first-ever pin

18:02.746 --> 18:05.748
From the 2014 winter
olympics in sochi, russia?

18:05.816 --> 18:07.650
His name is fatov.

18:07.718 --> 18:11.254
He represents the russian
spirit of sloth and alcoholism.

18:11.321 --> 18:13.689
Ah. Fatov.

18:13.757 --> 18:15.892
<i>("lara's theme" from dr.
Zhivago plays)</i>

18:21.064 --> 18:22.532
All for you.

18:29.106 --> 18:30.439
(laughs)

18:31.909 --> 18:33.276
We'll return to sudden-death overtime

18:33.343 --> 18:34.911
In the gold medal hockey game

18:34.978 --> 18:36.846
Between russia and the u.S. In a moment,

18:36.914 --> 18:38.948
But first, the forfeiture-signing ceremony,

18:39.016 --> 18:41.517
Where the injury-stricken u.
S. Mixed curling team

18:41.585 --> 18:44.186
Is about to concede its
chance at gold to sweden.

18:44.254 --> 18:47.590
Team captain seymour skinner
is preparing to sign.

18:47.658 --> 18:49.225
There's been some question

18:49.293 --> 18:51.027
As to whether he'll use his middle name.

18:51.094 --> 18:52.695
I guess we're about to find out.

18:52.763 --> 18:54.297
Okay, here comes the pen.

18:54.364 --> 18:56.399
The ink appears to be blue.

18:56.466 --> 18:58.701
No surrender!

18:58.769 --> 19:00.403
Let's give the olympics a miracle.

19:00.470 --> 19:02.972
But this time, on ice.

19:12.683 --> 19:16.752
(cheering)

19:16.820 --> 19:18.487
Oh, look at that broom work.

19:20.958 --> 19:23.025
Ah, they shouldn't be
playing quidditch at all.

19:23.093 --> 19:26.395
Not while four of the seven
horcruxes are still unfound.

19:31.501 --> 19:32.868
<i>Sacre bleu.</i>

19:32.936 --> 19:34.437
Sacred blue.

19:34.504 --> 19:36.172
It's okay, son.

19:36.239 --> 19:37.907
You did your best.

19:37.975 --> 19:40.476
Really, mother? Y-you mean that?

19:40.544 --> 19:42.244
I do.

19:42.312 --> 19:45.081
Before now, I never knew a
mother could love her child.

19:45.148 --> 19:49.685
Win or lose, I'm taking you
out for pizza and ice cream,

19:49.753 --> 19:51.921
And we can sit at the same table.

19:51.989 --> 19:53.255
(happy grunt)

20:00.364 --> 20:02.932
Costas: The u.S.A.
Has won demonstration gold.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.668
Our first and only medals
of these entire olympics.

20:05.736 --> 20:09.338
Kids, open your history books,
tear out the pages

20:09.406 --> 20:12.942
And put this indelible olympic moment in.

20:16.413 --> 20:18.781
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

20:18.849 --> 20:21.350
Oops.

20:21.418 --> 20:24.053
(crowd cheering)

20:24.121 --> 20:26.288
(the "star-spangled banner" plays)

20:29.826 --> 20:32.261
How's this for a date night?

20:32.329 --> 20:34.096
Wonderful, homie.

20:35.298 --> 20:36.832
Take that, sweden!

20:36.900 --> 20:39.268
Tell me how my ice tastes.
