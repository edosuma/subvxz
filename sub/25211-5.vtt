01:29.788 --> 01:32.428
I've been calling.

01:42.434 --> 01:44.304
Standard protocol
and resources in play,

01:44.336 --> 01:46.606
but the clock is short.

01:46.639 --> 01:47.779
Hungry?

01:48.841 --> 01:49.911
No thanks.

01:51.677 --> 01:52.817
Bring the Factor?

01:58.784 --> 02:00.624
Like I said, the clock is short.

02:02.454 --> 02:04.654
You know, fish have
a memory span of three seconds.

02:04.690 --> 02:06.490
I thought that was a myth.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.894
When does she expect
your report?

02:10.930 --> 02:13.930
Within the hour.
She's in transit now.

02:13.966 --> 02:15.836
Do you need more than that?

02:17.269 --> 02:19.569
No.

02:19.605 --> 02:22.375
That's plenty.

03:35.281 --> 03:37.651
Be alert for some
difficult driving conditions

03:37.683 --> 03:39.723
due to blowing snow
and drifting snow

03:39.752 --> 03:42.022
and icy snow-covered roads.

03:42.054 --> 03:45.294
National Weather Services
alerts states that visibility

03:45.324 --> 03:48.364
will be impacted for a mile
or less at times.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.934
In the southern part
of the state,

03:49.962 --> 03:52.032
including Bennington
and Windham Counties,

03:52.064 --> 03:54.634
snow is expected to begin
developing Monday night

03:54.667 --> 03:56.467
and last through Wednesday.

03:56.502 --> 03:59.742
Those areas are forecast
to receive 12 to 18 inches

03:59.772 --> 04:01.712
of snow. The snowfall rate

04:01.740 --> 04:03.410
is one to three inches an hour,

04:03.442 --> 04:05.512
according to the National
Weather Service.

04:05.544 --> 04:08.814
April 17, 1983
holds the record for snow

04:08.847 --> 04:10.517
received latest in the year

04:10.549 --> 04:12.319
that is greater
than eight inches.

04:12.351 --> 04:14.621
According to the National
Weather Service...

04:35.908 --> 04:37.508
Lizzie.

04:39.378 --> 04:40.588
What do you think you're doing?

04:40.612 --> 04:42.082
Um...

04:42.114 --> 04:45.014
- You're stealing from me?
- No, no. Um...

04:45.050 --> 04:46.750
Could you just..

04:46.785 --> 04:48.396
Could you please, please
put the gun down?

04:48.420 --> 04:50.320
Not doing that.

04:50.356 --> 04:52.996
Okay, I'm... I'm leaving.
I will leave.

04:53.025 --> 04:54.595
You sure are.

04:54.626 --> 04:56.826
Okay.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.600
All right, okay, um, just...

04:59.631 --> 05:01.701
Yeah, okay, okay.

05:01.734 --> 05:03.804
I'm just leaving.

05:03.836 --> 05:06.436
Leaving, leaving now.

05:30.129 --> 05:31.499
Fuck.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.550
You ever heard of the story
of the eagle and the bee?

05:51.583 --> 05:53.853
No, I... I haven't.

05:53.886 --> 05:56.986
It's a Russian fable.

05:57.022 --> 05:59.662
The bee was busying himself
by a flower

05:59.691 --> 06:02.891
when the eagle flew over
to express pity.

06:02.928 --> 06:05.728
He said, for all the work
the bee does,

06:05.764 --> 06:08.804
molding the honeycomb
and the hive,

06:08.834 --> 06:10.874
his labors
would go unrecognized.

06:10.903 --> 06:11.973
Unlike the eagle,

06:12.004 --> 06:13.844
who spread his wings

06:13.872 --> 06:16.612
and soared above for all to see,

06:16.642 --> 06:19.982
the bee would die
without distinction.

06:21.613 --> 06:24.413
The bee tried to explain
to the eagle

06:24.450 --> 06:27.920
that he was born to work
for the common good.

06:27.953 --> 06:30.023
He didn't seek attention.

06:30.055 --> 06:32.955
He said that when he looked
at the honeycombs,

06:32.991 --> 06:35.891
he consoled himself
with the thought that in them

06:35.928 --> 06:39.168
are a few drops of
his own honey,

06:39.198 --> 06:41.638
and that is enough.

06:41.667 --> 06:44.807
Well, I hope I'm not the eagle
in the story.

06:48.740 --> 06:50.210
Do you know why I'm here, Bill?

06:50.242 --> 06:51.642
I'm gonna assume it wasn't

06:51.677 --> 06:53.777
to tell me a fable.

06:54.680 --> 06:58.520
Does it have something to do with
the body they found in town?

06:58.550 --> 07:00.920
I heard a rumor
he was a Mennonite.

07:00.953 --> 07:02.193
Was he from your order?

07:02.221 --> 07:04.661
He was Amos.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.690
My son.

07:06.725 --> 07:09.625
Jesus, Jeremiah.

07:09.661 --> 07:11.901
Sorry. I didn't know.

07:15.167 --> 07:18.607
I used to tell him that story.

07:18.637 --> 07:20.637
I tried to instill in him

07:20.672 --> 07:23.742
that hard work
was distinction enough.

07:23.775 --> 07:25.215
Of all his peers,

07:25.244 --> 07:29.684
he was the last to return
from Rumspringa.

07:29.715 --> 07:31.715
Esther and I...

07:31.750 --> 07:35.050
We feared that the world
had taken him, but then,

07:35.087 --> 07:39.257
like all the others,
he came back to the fold,

07:39.291 --> 07:40.961
deliberate,

07:40.993 --> 07:42.963
committed,

07:42.995 --> 07:45.695
ready for covenant.

07:45.731 --> 07:46.931
And we told ourselves

07:46.965 --> 07:48.235
that he had stared sin

07:48.267 --> 07:50.737
squarely in the eyes.

07:50.769 --> 07:53.239
He had seen the pores
of the devil,

07:53.272 --> 07:56.542
only to come home inured.

07:56.575 --> 07:59.815
He overdosed on our fentanyl,

07:59.845 --> 08:01.615
the honey we make.

08:04.850 --> 08:06.020
I don't know what to say.

08:06.051 --> 08:08.751
We made a pact, our community.

08:08.787 --> 08:11.157
The product was not
for our own taking.

08:11.189 --> 08:13.029
So I continue to ask myself,

08:13.058 --> 08:15.598
was Amos

08:15.627 --> 08:17.167
weak?

08:17.195 --> 08:18.735
Was he unready?

08:18.764 --> 08:22.164
I felt the same way when
my son Clay was hurt.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.270
All due respect, Bill,
your boy's still alive.

08:24.303 --> 08:26.543
Only by the grace of God.

08:30.642 --> 08:33.741
Esther is mute with grief.

08:33.779 --> 08:36.578
The entire congregation
looks to me now,

08:36.615 --> 08:38.155
wondering which way is north.

08:38.183 --> 08:41.153
It's the same place
it always was, Jeremiah.

08:43.020 --> 08:45.061
Your people will follow
your lead.

08:47.759 --> 08:50.229
Do you know why my son
was in Reston?

08:52.631 --> 08:54.231
I was going to ask you
the same question.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.280
May I ask a favor of you?

09:06.311 --> 09:07.951
Anything.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.650
Local authorities
are holding his body,

09:09.681 --> 09:12.951
but we need to bury him
come sundown tomorrow.

09:12.985 --> 09:16.085
Given your connections,
I was hoping you could help.

09:16.121 --> 09:18.961
I'll make some phone calls.

09:56.194 --> 09:57.934
What the fuck is going on?

10:00.432 --> 10:02.072
Deputy Hulce.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.270
What is this?

10:03.301 --> 10:05.141
This is a DEA safe house.

10:05.170 --> 10:06.740
I'm Agent Nora Barnes.

10:06.772 --> 10:09.712
You've already met my partner,
Luis Castillo.

10:09.741 --> 10:10.785
Sorry, I couldn't
tell you anything

10:10.809 --> 10:14.009
until Agent Barnes arrived.

10:14.046 --> 10:15.616
Kolach?

10:17.716 --> 10:19.856
Is this about Bill Boone?

10:19.885 --> 10:21.785
He's smuggling drugs
into the US.

10:21.820 --> 10:23.760
The Mennonites are
his supplier, right?

10:23.789 --> 10:26.659
That's some good police work,
Deputy,

10:26.692 --> 10:29.132
but we need you to step aside.

10:30.328 --> 10:32.298
I can't.

10:32.330 --> 10:34.930
I have a body in the morgue.
I have an open case.

10:34.966 --> 10:36.336
Close it.

10:36.368 --> 10:38.368
We don't want to scare
either party away.

10:38.403 --> 10:40.803
They got eyes
in your department.

10:44.843 --> 10:46.713
Amos Miller was 19.
He was murdered.

10:46.745 --> 10:48.345
If we find evidence of a murder,

10:48.380 --> 10:49.920
we will bring charges,

10:49.948 --> 10:51.718
but for now,
we have bigger priorities.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.920
There's an opioid
crisis in this country.

10:53.952 --> 10:55.392
And we don't want
a small-town hunch

10:55.420 --> 10:57.120
jeopardizing our investigation.

10:57.155 --> 10:59.325
I'm not... I was in the NYPD.

10:59.357 --> 11:01.057
We know. We pulled your file,

11:01.093 --> 11:02.933
saw what happened there.

11:02.961 --> 11:08.001
Ortez Mackey, 19,
same age as Amos Miller.

11:08.967 --> 11:10.837
Look, we all got our own shit.

11:10.869 --> 11:13.339
You played nice
with the department then.

11:13.371 --> 11:15.311
We're just asking you
to do the same now.

11:15.340 --> 11:16.780
That's not why I...

11:16.808 --> 11:18.748
Let this go.

11:23.315 --> 11:24.345
There are many ways

11:24.382 --> 11:26.782
we let ourselves suffer.

11:26.818 --> 11:29.418
We all have mental
and physical pain

11:29.454 --> 11:33.394
that at times can feel like
too much to bear.

11:33.425 --> 11:35.325
This is why the first step

11:35.360 --> 11:37.200
is to recognize it,

11:37.229 --> 11:41.429
and only then
can we regain control.

11:43.769 --> 11:45.309
What the f...

11:48.106 --> 11:51.146
Jeremiah Miller
just paid me a visit.

11:53.011 --> 11:56.011
He's afflicted
by his son's overdose.

11:58.083 --> 11:59.323
Get some rest?

12:19.337 --> 12:21.977
There's no way Bill needs you
at the dealership this early.

12:22.007 --> 12:24.047
I just want to get a head start.

12:24.075 --> 12:25.775
Don't worry, I'll be
out of here soon.

12:25.811 --> 12:26.811
I...

12:26.845 --> 12:27.915
About last night,

12:27.946 --> 12:29.946
I wasn't trying to be a dick.

12:29.981 --> 12:31.526
You just... don't know Bill
the way I do.

12:31.550 --> 12:33.250
Thomas, you made your point...

12:33.285 --> 12:35.225
A number of times...

12:35.253 --> 12:38.093
But I'm not changing my mind.

12:38.123 --> 12:41.523
I need this job.

12:41.560 --> 12:42.960
Okay.

12:47.432 --> 12:49.972
Okay.

12:50.001 --> 12:52.141
What are you doing?

12:53.972 --> 12:57.212
Come here.

12:57.242 --> 13:00.112
It's your first day. You're
gonna need to eat something, so

13:00.145 --> 13:02.845
scrambled, or sunny side up?

13:13.024 --> 13:14.164
Townes.

13:14.192 --> 13:15.262
I can't talk.

13:15.293 --> 13:16.463
Have you seen Henry?

13:16.494 --> 13:17.594
She wasn't in homeroom.

13:17.629 --> 13:19.229
Not my problem.

13:19.264 --> 13:21.204
Wait, weren't you helping her?

13:21.233 --> 13:24.803
Henry doesn't want my help.
She doesn't want friends.

13:30.342 --> 13:31.619
Hey, it's Henry.
Leave a message.

13:31.643 --> 13:33.443
Hey, Jenna.

13:33.478 --> 13:35.178
Shit, sorry,
were you on the phone?

13:37.549 --> 13:40.389
- No, it's okay.
- Um, listen, I was wondering,

13:40.418 --> 13:43.058
a few of us are going to Lincoln
tonight to prank them back,

13:43.088 --> 13:45.366
you know, after the stunt they
pulled on our girls' bathroom.

13:45.390 --> 13:46.430
Right.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.328
Um, do you think

13:48.360 --> 13:51.200
maybe you want to come with me?

13:51.229 --> 13:53.269
I don't know if
it sounds stupid to you.

13:53.298 --> 13:56.138
I mean, it kind of does,
but I think it'll be fun.

13:56.167 --> 13:58.937
I don't know...
Unless you got other stuff.

13:58.970 --> 14:00.140
Sure.

14:00.171 --> 14:01.441
Sweet. Cool, okay.

14:01.473 --> 14:03.343
Well, I will text you
the details.

14:04.943 --> 14:06.913
You know, in fact, I can even...

14:06.945 --> 14:09.385
I can even pick you up,
if you want.

14:09.414 --> 14:10.914
Yeah, okay.

14:10.949 --> 14:13.189
Cool, awesome.

14:53.658 --> 14:56.658
You're crazy. All right!

14:56.695 --> 14:58.435
Have you been in my barn
all night?

14:58.463 --> 14:59.963
I'm... I'm pretty sure
I can explain.

14:59.998 --> 15:01.198
You don't get off my porch,

15:01.232 --> 15:03.172
I'm gonna split you in half.

15:03.201 --> 15:05.101
Okay.

15:05.136 --> 15:06.536
It's just, my car broke down.

15:06.571 --> 15:09.311
- In my closet?
- No.

15:09.341 --> 15:12.411
No, just, like,
a mile down the road.

15:12.444 --> 15:14.614
And how did you get in my house?

15:16.147 --> 15:17.617
I have a key.

15:17.649 --> 15:19.519
The hell you do.

15:19.551 --> 15:24.191
I do. Lizzie gave it to me.

15:24.222 --> 15:25.522
Lizzie?

15:27.559 --> 15:32.129
Why would my daughter give some
nutty girl the key to my house?

15:32.163 --> 15:35.303
Because I'm a student aide.

15:35.333 --> 15:37.403
I volunteer
in the homes of sick people

15:37.435 --> 15:39.035
- and sort of help them.
- I'm not sick.

15:39.070 --> 15:40.440
Even if I were,

15:40.472 --> 15:41.749
what would Lizzie know about it?

15:41.773 --> 15:44.643
Not that she'd give a damn.

15:44.676 --> 15:46.246
Lizzie, your daughter?

15:46.277 --> 15:47.717
Um...

15:47.746 --> 15:50.246
I...

15:50.281 --> 15:54.021
You know, I don't know.
She just hired me to...

15:54.052 --> 15:56.752
come help around the house,
to help clean the house

15:56.788 --> 15:58.658
because it needs it

15:58.690 --> 16:01.030
and... on my way here,

16:01.059 --> 16:03.429
my car literally just
slid off the road

16:03.461 --> 16:05.561
because of the black ice,

16:05.597 --> 16:08.197
and I have no cell reception
out here,

16:08.233 --> 16:10.633
so I had to walk a mile
from my car to get here.

16:10.668 --> 16:14.008
And when I knocked on the door,
nobody answered,

16:14.039 --> 16:17.009
so I just decided
to start working...

16:17.042 --> 16:18.582
in the closet.

16:18.610 --> 16:22.550
How come Lizzie didn't tell
me she was sending someone?

16:22.580 --> 16:24.120
I don't know.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.459
I don't know why
she would do that.

16:25.483 --> 16:28.223
Did she warn you about me?

16:29.521 --> 16:31.321
- Um...
- No, you can tell me.

16:31.356 --> 16:32.626
What did she say?

16:32.657 --> 16:35.027
She does have a tendency
not to hold back.

16:35.060 --> 16:36.230
I know that much.

16:36.261 --> 16:37.601
Yeah, right.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.734
I think you should just ask
her when she gets here.

16:43.134 --> 16:45.134
Lizzie's com...

16:45.170 --> 16:47.040
Coming here?

16:48.440 --> 16:51.540
Yeah, she just told me to call
her when I'm finished cleaning,

16:51.576 --> 16:53.216
and that should only
take a few hours,

16:53.244 --> 16:55.744
and then she's gonna be here.

17:00.318 --> 17:03.058
I hope you brought a vacuum.

17:05.522 --> 17:07.723
Have you got a name?

17:07.759 --> 17:09.628
Henry.

17:09.661 --> 17:11.401
Henry?

17:11.429 --> 17:13.368
Well, that's dumb.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.637
You can call me Dippy.

17:17.669 --> 17:20.239
That's much better.

17:21.606 --> 17:23.076
Sorry.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.651
So have you always lived here?

17:27.679 --> 17:29.249
Since '62.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.550
Same year I got pregnant.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.623
Terrible winter.

17:36.821 --> 17:41.231
Y... it isn't always like this,
just so you know.

17:41.259 --> 17:43.399
I'm in the middle of a project,

17:43.428 --> 17:45.828
and I wasn't expecting company.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.434
What project?

17:49.267 --> 17:52.407
What time did you say
that Lizzie was coming by?

17:52.437 --> 17:54.477
It should just be a few hours.

17:57.342 --> 17:59.342
I...

17:59.377 --> 18:01.517
Not so sure this is a good idea.

18:04.215 --> 18:06.255
I haven't even showered.

18:07.886 --> 18:11.126
Well, if you want
to go get ready, I can...

18:11.156 --> 18:13.756
you know, I can start
cleaning up around here.

18:16.794 --> 18:18.864
You won't even know
that I'm here.

18:20.632 --> 18:23.702
All right.

18:23.735 --> 18:27.835
Well, if... if you
steal anything, I'll know it.

18:27.872 --> 18:30.442
- Got it.
- And you can start with dishes.

18:30.475 --> 18:31.775
Okay.

18:46.524 --> 18:48.824
You have reached
the voice mailbox

18:48.860 --> 18:50.800
- belonging to...
- Townes Linderman.

18:50.828 --> 18:53.728
Please leave a message
after the tone.

18:57.502 --> 18:59.242
Hey, Townes...

18:59.270 --> 19:01.270
It's me. It's Henry.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.606
Um...

19:04.409 --> 19:08.249
So listen, I teleported again

19:08.279 --> 19:09.619
to the same place,

19:09.647 --> 19:12.617
and it turns out
that it is a house:

19:12.650 --> 19:14.190
My house,

19:14.219 --> 19:15.519
or at least it used to be.

19:15.553 --> 19:16.597
I'm pretty sure
I used to live here

19:16.621 --> 19:17.821
when I was little.

19:17.855 --> 19:19.595
I don't really remember.

19:19.624 --> 19:21.694
Um, but I think there
has to be something

19:21.726 --> 19:23.226
pretty significant about it.

19:23.261 --> 19:26.501
Because I moved around,
like, a lot.

19:26.531 --> 19:28.471
Anyway, I don't know
what the fuck to do,

19:28.499 --> 19:29.769
so call me back. Wait!

19:29.801 --> 19:31.941
No, no, no, don't call me back.

19:31.970 --> 19:34.640
I don't have service, so do not
call me back, not on this number.

19:34.672 --> 19:36.872
I'll... I can just call you again.

19:36.908 --> 19:38.608
Okay, bye.

19:46.718 --> 19:50.518
This model has a 1.8-liter,
four-cylinder engine,

19:50.555 --> 19:51.855
132 horsepower,

19:51.889 --> 19:53.829
gets about 30 miles
to the gallon,

19:53.858 --> 19:56.558
driving with the standard
five-speed manual transmission.

19:56.594 --> 19:57.594
Yeah, but this car's got

19:57.629 --> 19:59.899
over 150,000 miles on it.

19:59.931 --> 20:01.008
It's not about
the number of miles.

20:01.032 --> 20:02.502
It's about how they got there.

20:02.533 --> 20:03.503
There's no wear
on the suspension,

20:03.534 --> 20:04.534
no cracks in the belts.

20:04.569 --> 20:06.009
I'm gonna think about it.

20:06.037 --> 20:07.615
Well, let's... let's take it
for a test drive.

20:07.639 --> 20:09.409
No, I appreciate your help,
ma'am.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.884
Just around the block.
It'll take about five minutes.

20:10.908 --> 20:12.678
- You won't regret it.
- You have a good day.

20:20.551 --> 20:22.851
You got this, Cleo.
You got this, Cleo.

20:22.887 --> 20:24.527
Now, why am I...

20:24.555 --> 20:25.855
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry about that.

20:25.890 --> 20:27.034
Excuse me...
No, no, it's... it's my fault.

20:27.058 --> 20:28.028
I'm a little on edge.

20:28.059 --> 20:29.399
I'm... it's my first day.

20:29.427 --> 20:30.597
I'm Cleo Coles.

20:30.628 --> 20:31.928
I'm Lucas Boone.

20:31.963 --> 20:33.663
Nice... yeah,
you're Bill's other son.

20:33.698 --> 20:35.598
Yeah, yeah. Um...

20:35.633 --> 20:36.877
So... you mind if I bum
one of those off of you?

20:36.901 --> 20:38.271
Yeah.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.703
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

20:40.738 --> 20:41.978
Thanks.

20:42.006 --> 20:44.006
- You mind if I...
- Yeah.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.811
Can I ask you something?

20:48.846 --> 20:49.946
Have you ever seen anybody

20:49.981 --> 20:51.521
sell a car on their first day?

20:51.549 --> 20:54.619
I don't know.
I... work back here.

20:54.652 --> 20:56.892
I memorized everything,
that whole manual,

20:56.921 --> 20:59.361
and I just...
It's just not taking, you know?

20:59.390 --> 21:00.990
Well, my dad's favorite
catchphrase is.

21:01.025 --> 21:02.303
"You don't sell cars
with numbers,

21:02.327 --> 21:03.327
sell them with feelings,"

21:03.361 --> 21:05.561
for whatever that's worth.

21:05.596 --> 21:07.596
So, like, how the car
makes you feel,

21:07.632 --> 21:10.432
you know, like, with the wind
in your hair, kind of thing?

21:10.468 --> 21:13.368
Yeah, sure, I guess. Yeah.

21:13.404 --> 21:14.682
That's... that's
really good advice.

21:14.706 --> 21:15.676
Thanks, Lucas.

21:15.707 --> 21:16.737
Yeah. Good luck.

21:16.774 --> 21:18.344
Thanks.

21:25.550 --> 21:27.020
Deputy?

21:27.051 --> 21:30.521
What's the status on
that Mennonite DB?

21:30.555 --> 21:32.055
Open.

21:32.090 --> 21:33.530
You waiting on tox reports?

21:33.558 --> 21:34.958
No. Screenings came back

21:34.992 --> 21:36.532
with fatal levels of fentanyl.

21:36.561 --> 21:37.931
So why the hell is it
still open?

21:37.962 --> 21:40.702
These people want
their son's body back.

21:41.999 --> 21:43.339
How do you know that?

21:43.368 --> 21:45.968
Excuse me?

21:46.003 --> 21:48.643
I'm just curious how you know
they want their son's body back.

21:48.673 --> 21:50.113
Who told you that?

21:50.141 --> 21:52.541
The case is closed, Deputy.

21:52.577 --> 21:54.947
Hand it over.

22:07.058 --> 22:09.728
All right, no peeking.

22:09.761 --> 22:10.961
Yeah.

22:10.995 --> 22:12.135
Okay?

22:12.163 --> 22:14.733
Hang on.

22:14.766 --> 22:15.806
Open 'em.

22:20.104 --> 22:21.104
What do you think?

22:21.139 --> 22:22.679
Nice, right?

22:22.707 --> 22:24.107
Yeah, it's your room.

22:24.142 --> 22:26.482
Biggest room in the house.
It's on the main floor.

22:26.511 --> 22:30.081
- I brought all your stuff...
- No, I don't want these here.

22:30.114 --> 22:32.454
- What?
- I don't want these trophies here.

22:32.483 --> 22:34.523
Yeah, yeah, you want to be
surrounded

22:34.552 --> 22:36.852
- by your accomplishments...
- Just get rid of 'em!

22:36.888 --> 22:38.828
Okay.

22:39.590 --> 22:42.030
Okay, we'll get 'em out for now.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.398
Look, this is just
the beginning, Clay.

22:45.430 --> 22:46.673
We're... we're putting in ramps.

22:46.697 --> 22:48.697
We're gonna put railings
in the bathroom.

22:48.733 --> 22:50.433
We're lowering
all the countertops.

22:50.468 --> 22:51.645
We're gonna get things
back to normal around here

22:51.669 --> 22:53.469
real quick, son.

22:55.873 --> 22:57.843
Just get out.

23:00.845 --> 23:02.156
All right, buddy,
you just take a minute.

23:02.180 --> 23:03.850
Okay.

23:05.450 --> 23:07.850
- You let me know if you need anything.
- Yeah.

23:41.118 --> 23:43.718
Hey, this is Jenna. Sorry I
couldn't take your call,

23:43.754 --> 23:45.624
but leave a message,
and I'll get back to you

23:45.656 --> 23:47.496
as soon as I can.
Have a great day.

24:30.902 --> 24:33.042
Daddy?

24:34.038 --> 24:35.838
Come on.

24:35.873 --> 24:37.573
Shh, it's okay.

24:37.608 --> 24:39.278
Shh...

24:39.310 --> 24:41.910
Be quiet.

24:41.946 --> 24:43.786
Daddy?

24:48.753 --> 24:50.923
Daddy?

24:52.223 --> 24:53.593
Daddy?

25:13.644 --> 25:16.544
What was that?

25:16.581 --> 25:17.651
Henry?

25:49.246 --> 25:51.046
Lucas.

25:51.082 --> 25:52.952
Hey, Mom.

26:00.691 --> 26:01.661
Hi.

26:01.692 --> 26:02.962
- Hi.
- Hey.

26:06.030 --> 26:09.200
You said if I was ever in town

26:09.233 --> 26:12.603
to drop by, so I just figured...

26:16.974 --> 26:19.244
How are you? How's Clay?

26:19.276 --> 26:21.176
He's... he's all right.

26:21.212 --> 26:23.352
He's... getting
more used to things.

26:23.381 --> 26:25.921
Well, what a nice surprise.

26:25.950 --> 26:27.260
Honey, you didn't tell me
Lucas was visiting.

26:27.284 --> 26:29.054
Yeah, I didn't call. I'm Sorry.

26:29.086 --> 26:30.397
Well, you picked the perfect
time to drop by.

26:30.421 --> 26:32.291
We're just about to eat.

26:35.192 --> 26:37.032
Yeah, sure, that...
That would be great.

26:37.061 --> 26:38.231
All right.

26:41.732 --> 26:43.010
You want to take it
for a test drive?

26:43.034 --> 26:44.934
I'm just looking, thanks.

26:44.969 --> 26:47.339
You looking
for anything specific?

26:47.371 --> 26:48.971
I just need something

26:49.006 --> 26:52.176
to take my kids from school
to hockey practice.

26:52.209 --> 26:54.249
Well, what about you?

26:54.278 --> 26:55.748
What about me?

26:55.780 --> 26:57.350
Well, what kind of car
do you want?

26:57.381 --> 26:59.021
What would make you feel good?

26:59.050 --> 27:01.050
I just need something big enough

27:01.085 --> 27:03.385
to schlep the kids around.

27:03.421 --> 27:05.298
What kind of car did you
drive when you were younger?

27:05.322 --> 27:08.962
I had a VW Rabbit in high school.
Remember those?

27:08.993 --> 27:10.293
Yeah, of course.

27:10.327 --> 27:11.997
What color?

27:12.029 --> 27:13.969
Yellow.

27:13.998 --> 27:17.398
Then you are definitely not
a minivan girl.

27:17.435 --> 27:19.175
Follow me.

27:19.203 --> 27:20.973
Now,

27:21.005 --> 27:22.245
this one is not a Rabbit,

27:22.273 --> 27:23.943
but it's pretty great.

27:23.974 --> 27:26.214
It's got a five-star
safety rating,

27:26.243 --> 27:27.383
all-wheel drive,

27:27.411 --> 27:30.081
and most importantly,

27:30.114 --> 27:31.754
leather seats.

27:31.782 --> 27:33.152
Take a look.

27:36.320 --> 27:37.290
That's nice.

27:37.321 --> 27:38.891
Yeah?

27:38.923 --> 27:41.293
Maybe a bit too nice.
I have three boys,

27:41.325 --> 27:43.395
six, nine, and 12, so...

27:43.427 --> 27:44.727
Oof.

27:44.762 --> 27:46.032
Well, the good news is that

27:46.063 --> 27:48.003
the leather's
not that much more,

27:48.032 --> 27:50.010
and I gotta tell you, I
practically raised my daughter

27:50.034 --> 27:51.734
in a station wagon
with cloth seats.

27:51.769 --> 27:53.269
It was a nightmare,

27:53.304 --> 27:55.004
'cause, like, you know,
with leather,

27:55.039 --> 27:57.939
you can wipe the spills away
and the stains, no problem,

27:57.975 --> 27:59.475
but with cloth, not so much.

27:59.510 --> 28:00.980
After a few months,

28:01.011 --> 28:02.781
I wanted to set that thing
on fire

28:02.813 --> 28:04.853
'cause everything smelled like
rotten milk and tuna.

28:06.283 --> 28:09.153
Now, we don't have this
in yellow, but...

28:09.186 --> 28:11.956
what do you think of this
cherry red?

28:11.989 --> 28:14.229
- Can I... Yeah?
- Yeah, please.

28:19.897 --> 28:21.967
It's nice, right?

28:21.999 --> 28:23.739
Can I take it for a test drive?

28:23.768 --> 28:25.408
Yeah, yeah, let me just
go get the keys.

28:25.436 --> 28:27.036
- Great.
- You make yourself at home.

28:35.946 --> 28:38.286
I'd make you pay
for whatever it is you broke,

28:38.315 --> 28:40.055
but it's all a heap of junk
anyhow.

28:40.084 --> 28:42.884
They can throw it away
when I die.

28:42.920 --> 28:46.390
Nice job cleaning.

28:46.423 --> 28:48.293
Do you want me to...

28:49.794 --> 28:50.894
Can I?

28:50.928 --> 28:53.298
Can you what?

28:53.330 --> 28:55.400
I can help.

28:58.969 --> 29:01.339
If it'll make you feel useful.

29:04.275 --> 29:05.945
I need to ask you something.

29:05.976 --> 29:07.976
You know, I used
to get my nails done

29:08.012 --> 29:10.982
once a week.

29:11.015 --> 29:13.215
Not much point these days.

29:21.058 --> 29:23.858
When I called Lizzie

29:23.894 --> 29:25.939
to tell her I got lung cancer,
you know what she said?

29:25.963 --> 29:28.433
She said...

29:28.465 --> 29:30.165
"I'm sorry for you, Mom."

29:30.201 --> 29:31.901
Well, what does that mean?

29:31.936 --> 29:33.976
"I'm sorry for you."

29:37.842 --> 29:40.382
When my mother died,
I was on my honeymoon

29:40.411 --> 29:41.981
and I called my father

29:42.012 --> 29:43.382
and asked if I should come back,

29:43.414 --> 29:45.014
and he said,

29:45.049 --> 29:46.949
"No, your mother has
a little cold.

29:46.984 --> 29:49.854
Nothing to worry about."

29:56.060 --> 29:57.600
Is your mother still alive?

30:00.564 --> 30:03.564
Are you two close?

30:03.601 --> 30:05.471
Not really.

30:05.502 --> 30:08.472
You know, I have never
met a family

30:08.505 --> 30:10.905
that didn't do anything
but make themselves

30:10.941 --> 30:15.411
miserable with each other?
Not my own, not my friends.

30:15.446 --> 30:18.516
And then, when my husband
took off,

30:18.549 --> 30:19.989
I had to

30:20.017 --> 30:21.917
move in with my sister,

30:21.952 --> 30:24.492
and boy, that was not good
for anybody.

30:24.521 --> 30:26.161
So you haven't always
lived here?

30:26.190 --> 30:29.890
Well, I rented it out
for a couple of years

30:29.927 --> 30:32.167
to a young married couple.

30:32.196 --> 30:35.336
Did they have kids?

30:35.366 --> 30:37.606
A little girl.

30:37.635 --> 30:40.275
And for a while, they seemed
okay... happy enough...

30:40.304 --> 30:43.074
But then, of course,
that wasn't the case.

30:43.107 --> 30:47.277
That husband was
a piece of work.

30:47.311 --> 30:50.011
Really?

30:50.047 --> 30:51.447
How... how so? What was he...

30:51.482 --> 30:53.652
Well, he had that,

30:53.684 --> 30:56.254
now what do they call it?
Some condition.

30:56.287 --> 30:58.157
Paranoid schizophrenic.

31:02.259 --> 31:04.129
Are you sure that
that's what he had?

31:04.161 --> 31:06.001
Yes, a violent one.

31:06.030 --> 31:08.000
He destroyed half my house

31:08.032 --> 31:09.632
and then left them
without a penny.

31:09.667 --> 31:11.267
That woman

31:11.302 --> 31:12.942
and her little girl...

31:12.970 --> 31:15.540
What a mess.

31:15.572 --> 31:19.282
But they were better off
for it, that's what I think.

31:19.310 --> 31:21.210
Watch the skin!

31:21.245 --> 31:22.545
Sorry.

31:28.452 --> 31:32.222
Lucas, what college
did you say you were going to?

31:32.256 --> 31:35.126
Actually, I don't...

31:35.159 --> 31:38.029
I don't go to college.

31:38.062 --> 31:40.432
I'm sorry.
I thought that I heard

31:40.464 --> 31:42.104
you were studying
with your father.

31:42.132 --> 31:44.072
Yeah, to be a mechanic.

31:44.101 --> 31:45.701
Lucas deferred school
for a few years.

31:45.736 --> 31:47.276
He still might go back, though.

31:47.304 --> 31:49.674
Of course.

31:49.707 --> 31:53.947
Lucas, your mom told me that you've had
your plate full lately with your brother.

31:53.978 --> 31:57.248
It's very good of you
to be by his side.

31:57.281 --> 31:59.121
Yeah, well, you do what you can
for family.

31:59.149 --> 32:01.589
Absolutely. I can't imagine

32:01.618 --> 32:04.358
how hard it's been
for all of you.

32:04.388 --> 32:07.358
Especially you, Wendy.
You're so busy with church.

32:07.391 --> 32:09.331
Well, we have a very supportive
community here,

32:09.360 --> 32:12.060
but... it's been difficult.

32:12.096 --> 32:14.166
Well, I can attest to that.

32:14.198 --> 32:17.368
After my knee surgery, I was
in a wheelchair for six weeks.

32:17.401 --> 32:19.241
Miserable experience.

32:23.073 --> 32:24.743
You know, Lucas, I,

32:24.775 --> 32:27.075
gave a sermon last Sunday
about your brother.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.611
You did?

32:28.645 --> 32:30.545
Robert, Lucas doesn't
want to discuss religion.

32:30.581 --> 32:33.481
- Let him...
- No, actually, I'd like to hear it.

32:33.517 --> 32:35.287
It was about challenges

32:35.319 --> 32:37.419
that God allows into our
lives to test us.

32:37.454 --> 32:40.554
There's a passage from
the book of Romans that goes,

32:40.591 --> 32:42.461
"Those who are strong

32:42.493 --> 32:47.303
have an obligation to bear with
the failings of the weak."

32:47.331 --> 32:49.401
Yeah, that makes sense.

32:53.203 --> 32:55.473
You have reached the voice...

32:55.506 --> 32:56.606
Fuck.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.520
Wow.

33:11.555 --> 33:14.095
Don't compliment me.

33:14.124 --> 33:18.034
I know, I clean up all right.

33:18.062 --> 33:20.462
And besides, if you compliment

33:20.497 --> 33:22.637
as well as you clean,

33:22.666 --> 33:25.066
well, I might just
end up insulted.

33:27.071 --> 33:28.811
Look at this place.

33:28.839 --> 33:30.617
Worse than when you got here.
Wait till Lizzie sees

33:30.641 --> 33:33.481
what she's paying you for.

33:38.582 --> 33:41.122
Do you think I look okay?

33:42.753 --> 33:44.423
I do.

33:46.757 --> 33:50.327
It's been seven years.

33:52.496 --> 33:54.396
- Since you saw Lizzie?
- Yeah.

33:58.202 --> 34:01.402
When... when is she

34:01.438 --> 34:04.338
getting here, anyway?

34:04.374 --> 34:06.674
She still driving that pickup?

34:10.313 --> 34:13.414
You know, maybe I should
give her a call and see

34:13.449 --> 34:15.650
like, just where she's at.

34:15.686 --> 34:18.356
Yeah, go ahead.

34:18.388 --> 34:20.088
Okay.

34:28.732 --> 34:31.702
Do you have a phone
somewhere else?

34:31.735 --> 34:34.775
You want to talk behind my back?

34:34.804 --> 34:36.875
No.

34:36.907 --> 34:38.647
What has Lizzie been
telling you about me?

34:38.675 --> 34:39.752
- Nothing.
- Did she tell you

34:39.775 --> 34:41.275
that I'm some kind of maniac?

34:41.311 --> 34:42.681
A... a shut-in?

34:43.914 --> 34:45.284
No.

34:58.362 --> 35:00.562
You can use the phone
in my bedroom.

35:15.712 --> 35:18.512
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

35:18.549 --> 35:20.149
Food was great.

35:20.184 --> 35:21.924
Come by next Sunday.

35:21.952 --> 35:25.452
I gotta work then,
but thank you for

35:25.489 --> 35:26.689
having me here.

35:32.629 --> 35:33.669
Thanks.

35:40.504 --> 35:41.704
I called him several times.

35:41.738 --> 35:43.638
I told you that.

35:43.674 --> 35:46.414
He wouldn't call me back,
and your dad and I are just

35:46.443 --> 35:49.313
- oil and water.
- You know, honestly, Mom, it's fine.

35:49.346 --> 35:50.886
Don't worry about it.
You were too busy

35:50.914 --> 35:52.584
telling people
about your son's accident

35:52.616 --> 35:54.516
to actually go and visit him,

35:54.551 --> 35:56.491
so...

35:56.520 --> 35:57.920
I pray for you two every night.

35:57.955 --> 35:59.625
It's actions, Mom.

35:59.656 --> 36:01.756
Actions show love.

36:01.792 --> 36:02.936
I knew you came here
to guilt me.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.260
No, I didn't.

36:04.294 --> 36:05.494
No? Then why?

36:06.930 --> 36:08.530
I don't see you for months

36:08.565 --> 36:10.635
and then you just show up
out of the blue?

36:24.648 --> 36:25.818
Good-bye, Mom.

36:37.561 --> 36:38.701
- Shh, be quiet.
- No.

36:38.729 --> 36:39.799
Stop being so paranoid.

36:41.698 --> 36:44.338
- Yo, this prank is sick.
- I know, right?

36:44.368 --> 36:46.338
Yo, Lincoln's basically
underwater, bro.

36:46.370 --> 36:47.780
Look at this. School's...
school's drowning.

36:47.804 --> 36:48.974
Drowning. School's drowning.

36:49.006 --> 36:50.346
Let me to the other side.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.974
Okay, okay. Sorry, sorry.

36:54.011 --> 36:58.311
It's genius. I know.

36:58.348 --> 37:01.448
So, what's up with you and Zach?

37:01.485 --> 37:03.485
Nothing.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.860
He's cute.

37:04.888 --> 37:06.828
He's sweet, too.

37:06.857 --> 37:08.327
Do you like him?

37:08.358 --> 37:10.028
I don't know.

37:10.060 --> 37:11.830
Jenna, you always do this.

37:11.862 --> 37:13.632
No, I don't. Do what?

37:16.533 --> 37:18.478
You always have all these boys
vying for your attention

37:18.502 --> 37:21.442
and you never do anything
about it.

37:21.471 --> 37:22.971
It's like you're asexual
or something.

37:23.006 --> 37:25.776
I'm not asexual.

37:25.809 --> 37:27.879
Look, I'm just saying that

37:27.911 --> 37:30.651
Zach would be the perfect
starter boyfriend.

37:30.681 --> 37:31.911
Starter boyfriend?

37:31.948 --> 37:34.488
Yeah, like the samples
at Costco.

37:34.518 --> 37:35.862
You take a bite,
but you don't have to buy it

37:35.886 --> 37:37.656
if it leaves a bad taste
in your mouth.

37:37.688 --> 37:39.658
Patty, you're ridiculous.

37:39.690 --> 37:41.330
I'm just saying...

37:41.358 --> 37:42.498
Damian!

37:42.526 --> 37:43.826
Just put me down!

37:43.860 --> 37:45.760
Whoa, you're heavier
than I thought.

37:45.796 --> 37:46.866
No.

37:46.897 --> 37:47.897
You're such a jerk.

37:47.931 --> 37:49.701
Come on, grab these cups.

37:49.733 --> 37:50.910
We've gotta get all this water

37:50.934 --> 37:52.904
and pour it down the hall.
Come on.

37:53.603 --> 37:56.943
Hey. Having a good time?

37:56.973 --> 37:58.573
Yeah.

37:58.608 --> 38:00.578
Good. Glad you came.

38:01.678 --> 38:03.448
I thought you said
security started at 10:00.

38:03.480 --> 38:04.450
That's what they said
when I called.

38:04.481 --> 38:05.751
You called the school?

38:05.782 --> 38:08.382
Guys, guys, security!
Go, go, go.

38:08.418 --> 38:10.518
- Hey, hey, stop! Who's there?
- This way.

38:10.554 --> 38:12.031
- Where are you going?
- He can't follow all of us.

38:12.055 --> 38:13.325
God damn it!

38:13.357 --> 38:14.997
This way.

38:15.025 --> 38:16.395
Shit, get down!

38:16.426 --> 38:17.566
Under here.

38:17.594 --> 38:18.594
Goddamn kids...

38:18.628 --> 38:19.628
Shh, shh.

38:19.663 --> 38:20.733
God damn it.

38:20.764 --> 38:22.604
- What if we...
- Shh.

38:22.632 --> 38:24.372
- What if we get caught?
- We won't.

38:24.401 --> 38:26.441
- You don't know that.
- Yeah, I do. I'm a ninja.

38:27.604 --> 38:28.844
Don't move. Don't move.

38:41.385 --> 38:43.525
Um...

38:43.553 --> 38:45.453
We should get going.

38:45.489 --> 38:46.929
Wait.

38:46.957 --> 38:48.597
But what if...

38:48.625 --> 38:51.425
Can I kiss you?

38:51.461 --> 38:52.761
Um...

40:11.208 --> 40:12.678
Is this okay?

40:12.709 --> 40:14.749
A little slower.

40:38.134 --> 40:40.974
We can stop.

40:41.004 --> 40:44.104
No, I... I can go slower.

40:47.978 --> 40:50.248
I'm sorry. It's okay.

40:50.280 --> 40:52.750
I think we should just
go meet up with everyone.

41:01.958 --> 41:03.928
Good night, Lucas.

41:08.798 --> 41:10.098
Lucas?

41:10.133 --> 41:11.973
Lucas, I did it!

41:12.002 --> 41:15.802
I did what you told me to,
and I just sold my first car!

41:15.839 --> 41:17.239
Thank you so much.

41:18.308 --> 41:20.508
I can't believe it.

41:49.573 --> 41:50.973
It's freezing out there tonight.

41:51.007 --> 41:52.118
Yeah, thanks for meeting me.

41:52.142 --> 41:53.982
Of course.

41:54.010 --> 41:56.250
I've been wanting to get a
side business going for years,

41:56.279 --> 41:58.579
but my father refuses to listen.

41:58.615 --> 42:00.055
Yeah, mine too.

42:00.083 --> 42:03.123
It's kind of hot in here.

42:03.153 --> 42:05.053
I run cold.

42:07.123 --> 42:08.923
So what's your plan
for getting the

42:08.959 --> 42:12.259
product into new markets?

42:12.295 --> 42:13.565
What?

42:14.598 --> 42:16.698
What'd you do that for?

42:18.301 --> 42:20.671
- For Clay.
- Clay?

42:20.704 --> 42:21.744
That's my fucking brother,

42:21.771 --> 42:23.241
you fucking piece of shit!

42:25.208 --> 42:26.678
Fuck you!

42:26.710 --> 42:28.350
Fuck you!

43:23.066 --> 43:25.666
Sorry, I know it's a long drive.

43:25.702 --> 43:29.702
I just really need
to get out of here, so...

43:29.739 --> 43:34.749
Yeah, I think I'm, like,
about a mile from the highway.

43:34.778 --> 43:35.948
Okay.

43:37.714 --> 43:39.284
Yeah, please hurry.

43:39.315 --> 43:41.855
Okay, bye.

43:45.155 --> 43:49.055
- Dippy, I...
- She's not coming, is she?

43:51.828 --> 43:53.172
I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't...

43:53.196 --> 43:55.296
Get out.

43:58.468 --> 44:00.838
Please, th...

44:00.870 --> 44:03.910
There's just this thing
that happens to me,

44:03.940 --> 44:05.180
and it brought me here

44:05.208 --> 44:07.048
and I was just trying
to figure out why.

44:07.077 --> 44:08.747
Get out of my house.

44:47.417 --> 44:48.887
Everything's in order.

45:04.200 --> 45:06.100
You're free to take him now,
Mr. Miller.

45:25.388 --> 45:27.388
I'm sorry.

45:42.272 --> 45:43.783
And then we were in
the bathroom and we were

45:43.807 --> 45:45.151
crammed into this
tiny little stall

45:45.175 --> 45:46.285
and Damian wouldn't stop
laughing,

45:46.309 --> 45:47.909
so I had to tell him to shut up.

45:47.944 --> 45:49.044
And I saw the flashlight,

45:49.078 --> 45:50.356
and I just jumped out the window

45:50.380 --> 45:52.320
and it wasn't even
that far of a drop,

45:52.348 --> 45:54.418
but Damian, with his knee hurt,

45:54.450 --> 45:57.020
and... such a baby.

45:58.888 --> 46:01.188
Jenna.

46:01.224 --> 46:03.094
Sorry, what?

46:03.126 --> 46:04.496
How far did you go with Zach?

46:04.527 --> 46:06.267
Jesus, Patty,
keep your voice down.

46:06.296 --> 46:08.296
What? Your dad's not
even working tonight.

46:08.331 --> 46:11.501
Just tell me before
the boys get here.

46:11.534 --> 46:12.974
It wasn't a big deal.

46:13.002 --> 46:15.802
Well, did you make out?

46:15.839 --> 46:17.069
A little.

46:17.106 --> 46:19.246
And then I gave him a hand-job.

46:20.610 --> 46:22.410
Really?

46:22.445 --> 46:26.285
I mean... it's just what
seemed like was right.

46:26.316 --> 46:29.056
Well tell me he gave you
a little something, too.

46:30.520 --> 46:31.920
There... there wasn't enough time.

46:31.955 --> 46:34.825
Jenna, there's always time.

46:36.526 --> 46:38.926
Boys can be so selfish.

46:42.232 --> 46:44.832
Here they come. Please don't
say anything to Zach.

46:44.868 --> 46:46.808
You know I wouldn't.

46:48.338 --> 46:49.308
Hey, guys.

46:49.339 --> 46:50.839
- Hey.
- Hi.

46:58.214 --> 47:00.154
Starter boyfriend.

47:01.417 --> 47:02.587
Another round, Iris?

47:02.619 --> 47:03.629
No, I'm gonna settle up, Gill.

47:03.653 --> 47:04.623
I gotta get to work.

47:04.654 --> 47:05.624
Didn't know you were

47:05.655 --> 47:06.895
working night shifts.

47:06.923 --> 47:08.923
I'm filling in for Cleo.

47:08.958 --> 47:10.328
She's working for Bill Boone
now.

47:10.360 --> 47:13.060
Yeah? Good for her.

47:13.096 --> 47:14.296
Right.

47:14.330 --> 47:15.370
What man doesn't love

47:15.398 --> 47:16.498
a good Cinderella story?

48:09.519 --> 48:10.959
Hey.

48:14.490 --> 48:16.190
Thanks for coming to get me.

48:16.225 --> 48:17.265
You okay?

48:20.463 --> 48:23.363
Can you take me to Reston?

48:23.399 --> 48:25.669
Yeah.

48:27.403 --> 48:28.573
Where is that?

48:28.604 --> 48:31.004
Just drive. I can show you.

49:04.607 --> 49:06.747
Really, Nikolai?

49:06.776 --> 49:07.746
I'm done.

49:07.777 --> 49:09.217
We lost one.

49:09.245 --> 49:11.045
That's not good for the company.

49:11.080 --> 49:12.380
We...

49:12.415 --> 49:13.515
We lost two.

49:13.549 --> 49:15.749
Yes, the boy.

49:15.785 --> 49:18.655
That was unfortunate.

49:18.688 --> 49:20.688
But there's a new series
of gravitational shifts

49:20.723 --> 49:21.993
that match the profile.

49:22.025 --> 49:23.725
You know how rare this is.

49:25.228 --> 49:27.168
We have an arrangement, Nikolai.

49:27.196 --> 49:28.996
Which I've paid for twice over.

49:29.032 --> 49:31.002
And what are you going to do

49:31.034 --> 49:33.004
with only one shipment of
Factor?

49:33.036 --> 49:36.606
Crawl under the porch and die?

49:36.639 --> 49:39.209
One last assignment, and I'll
give you enough for a year.

49:39.242 --> 49:41.242
How does that sound?
A whole year.

49:41.277 --> 49:44.477
One more. One more.

49:44.514 --> 49:46.214
Where?

49:46.249 --> 49:48.719
A small town
in upstate New York.

49:48.751 --> 49:50.621
A place called Reston.

49:51.305 --> 49:57.370
