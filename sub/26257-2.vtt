WEBVTT

00:15.056 --> 00:17.726
That's a nice suit you've got on, sir.

00:18.143 --> 00:20.854
I was in Milan until yesterday.

00:20.979 --> 00:23.565
Domenico tailored it especially for me.

00:23.648 --> 00:24.858
Wow.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.818
I had to return home once I got there.

00:28.111 --> 00:31.656
Fate is finally on the move.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.679
<i>Hey! Quit dawdling!</i>

00:54.763 --> 00:58.183
Erm... Foxtrot mode... Foxtrot... Ack!

01:09.444 --> 01:11.696
How did she do, Captain Zaito?

01:12.280 --> 01:13.490
Hisone Amakasu.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.992
It's unthinkable.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.494
She lacks that much promise?

01:18.745 --> 01:20.080
She doesn't have the passion.

01:20.163 --> 01:20.997
What?

01:21.623 --> 01:22.665
For women,

01:23.333 --> 01:26.461
I'd welcome them
from the cradle to the grave!

01:26.920 --> 01:29.506
But Amakasu doesn't respond whatsoever!

01:30.799 --> 01:34.052
Ah, Flight Leader Kakiyasu,
she can do it.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.011
Do not worry!

01:36.304 --> 01:38.014
That does not put me at ease.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.023
Well done.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.401
Here! Eat up!

01:50.652 --> 01:52.320
K-Kaizaki...

01:52.403 --> 01:55.365
You only chose Amakasu
for her flip phone, right?

01:55.448 --> 01:57.325
She sure is persistent.

01:57.659 --> 02:01.412
Come here and eat me! Eat me! Come on!

02:04.582 --> 02:05.959
He ate Kaizaki!

02:13.091 --> 02:14.843
The flip phones are gone...

02:14.968 --> 02:18.763
That's amazing.
You're quite nimble, aren't you?

02:20.515 --> 02:23.143
-How dare you mock me!
-Violence isn't the answer!

02:23.226 --> 02:25.145
Don't mess with me, you--

02:27.438 --> 02:28.273
I...

02:28.898 --> 02:30.233
Ikushima?

02:30.441 --> 02:32.235
You've come home!

02:32.318 --> 02:34.571
Finally, we meet.

02:35.113 --> 02:39.576
I... I really wanted to see you, too.

02:39.742 --> 02:43.288
But... I never thought
you'd say this here...

02:45.832 --> 02:46.666
Huh?

02:53.798 --> 02:56.217
Hips, 33.9 inches.

02:56.301 --> 02:59.971
I NAME THE DRAGON MASOTAN

03:21.034 --> 03:23.036
DRAGON PILOT: HISONE & MASOTAN

04:43.574 --> 04:46.411
This man worked for Okamoto Kasei
and Barnes Wallis

04:46.494 --> 04:50.290
heading specialized clothing development.
This is Manager Ikushima.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.207
Mm-hmm.

04:51.582 --> 04:53.710
He develops pilots' suits?

04:53.793 --> 04:56.337
Well, the OTF suits

04:56.462 --> 04:59.090
are incomparable to other suits.

04:59.173 --> 05:03.803
First, they must not be dissolved
by gastric juices.

05:03.886 --> 05:08.641
Furthermore, they function as sensors
to check the organism and collect data.

05:08.933 --> 05:13.313
The OTF has been rejecting pilots
for three years.

05:13.479 --> 05:18.109
No matter what goodies we tried
to feed it, it wouldn't keep it in.

05:18.901 --> 05:22.822
But thanks to you,
we can rise to the next stage.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.451
Now then. Take off your clothes.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.120
I want you to relax.

05:29.954 --> 05:33.124
I'm only interested in your... body.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.168
A major problem is taking place!

05:35.251 --> 05:36.961
Shoulders, 14 inches.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.214
Mr. Ikushima!

05:40.631 --> 05:42.425
Oh, Kaizaki.

05:42.675 --> 05:46.637
I wrote a report on the prototype suit!

05:49.015 --> 05:52.393
Ask me anything!
I will cooperate to the fullest!

05:52.477 --> 05:53.644
I just have one question.

05:54.062 --> 05:57.023
Does Hisone Amakasu like sweet things?

05:57.106 --> 05:58.107
Huh?

05:58.191 --> 06:03.529
From what I could see, she's bordering
between a B-cup and a C-cup.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.615
Are you talking about Amakasu's suit?

06:06.032 --> 06:09.494
An extreme fluctuation in weight
will affect the measurements.

06:09.786 --> 06:10.787
Please excuse me.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.916
That bastard...

06:15.375 --> 06:17.043
I'm going to bully you to death!

06:17.377 --> 06:18.211
Achoo!

06:19.420 --> 06:20.838
Oh my.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.341
The mysterious Joa lady.

06:24.092 --> 06:26.886
Why do you always appear
when I'm troubled?

06:27.178 --> 06:29.389
Oh dear, you're feeling troubled?

06:29.555 --> 06:31.557
Oh! Um, yes.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.769
Well, I met someone recently.

06:36.354 --> 06:39.065
I felt like fate was calling me,

06:40.066 --> 06:43.486
like it saw something that only I have.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.822
Isn't that nice?

06:45.905 --> 06:47.824
But now that I've started,

06:47.907 --> 06:51.619
it's not going well, and I'm full of
bewilderment, hardship, and distress.

06:51.702 --> 06:54.622
And then this very forward
pervert appeared...

06:55.415 --> 06:56.374
Here.

06:56.457 --> 06:59.544
Have a yogurt.

06:59.627 --> 07:00.628
Thank you very--

07:04.966 --> 07:08.928
That lady works in mysterious ways.
There must be some meaning attached.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.848
I don't have a spoon.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.520
Ground beef cutlet today, huh?

07:19.105 --> 07:20.982
You eat this one.

07:22.316 --> 07:27.029
<i>You're undeserving of this super delicious</i>
<i>ground beef cutlet, newbie.</i>

07:27.155 --> 07:29.782
<i>You're only worthy of</i>
<i>this crappy croquette I made.</i>

07:31.367 --> 07:35.538
The potatoes are so chunky,
they roll in my mouth. It's so yummy!

07:43.880 --> 07:45.673
<i>Try sleeping through this.</i>

07:46.132 --> 07:49.802
<i>You'll be too tired to function tomorrow!</i>

07:50.094 --> 07:52.972
Lakitu, Lakitu...

07:53.556 --> 07:56.517
Goro loved that character...

07:56.642 --> 07:59.270
Imagine being on that cloud...

08:03.691 --> 08:05.193
How is she sleeping?!

08:05.276 --> 08:06.819
The nerve of this nitwit...

08:17.246 --> 08:19.332
I'm so hooked on the story, I can't sleep.

08:22.418 --> 08:23.377
I slept like a baby!

08:23.878 --> 08:26.214
Oh, good morning!

08:27.465 --> 08:30.259
Kaizaki, you've got some
dark circles under your eyes.

08:30.426 --> 08:31.385
Shuddap!

08:33.095 --> 08:35.181
You forgot to gargle!

08:38.100 --> 08:42.188
<i>Kaizaki might act like</i>
<i>she's in a bad mood, but I know better.</i>

08:42.355 --> 08:46.067
<i>She gave me her croquette so I didn't have</i>
<i>to eat ground meat I don't like.</i>

08:46.234 --> 08:49.111
<i>She cheered me up</i>
<i>so I wouldn't feel homesick.</i>

08:49.195 --> 08:52.198
<i>She's actually a kind and mature woman.</i>

08:52.448 --> 08:53.491
Kaizaki...

08:53.574 --> 08:56.369
no, maybe I'll call her Nao next time.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.580
A stable position in the body
directly after being swallowed

08:59.664 --> 09:04.627
greatly affects the reaction speed of the
following Action Control Signal, or ACS.

09:04.710 --> 09:05.920
Onto action coordinates.

09:06.003 --> 09:08.339
-Nao. Nao!
-All positions start with actions...

09:08.673 --> 09:11.467
Hey! Who gave you permission
to be casual with me?!

09:11.551 --> 09:13.052
-You--
-Third Class Kaizaki.

09:20.351 --> 09:24.772
I understand the arrival of a new Dragon
Pilot prospect can divert your attention.

09:24.855 --> 09:25.690
However,

09:26.399 --> 09:31.195
what would Former Officer Kaizaki
think of your carefree attitude?

09:34.323 --> 09:35.783
Now then, continuing on.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.705
Wow, a lot is coming off of you!

09:40.997 --> 09:43.499
It's because it's very humid here.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.836
Every three days we need
to wash off the red mold.

09:47.211 --> 09:50.089
You look like you're
enjoying yourself, Mr. OTF.

09:50.172 --> 09:53.593
Come to think of it,
what is Mr. OTF's name?

09:53.676 --> 09:56.262
Can't he just be F-15J?

09:56.345 --> 09:58.472
That's just the name of his armor.

09:58.764 --> 10:03.644
-It's like calling me "work uniform."
-I see what you mean.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.272
What about Otofu?

10:06.606 --> 10:07.607
"Otofu?"

10:07.898 --> 10:08.774
Said like that?

10:09.025 --> 10:10.901
Don't you get it?

10:11.110 --> 10:12.612
OTF.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.031
OTF. Oh-to-fu.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.366
Oh tofu. Otofu!

10:17.450 --> 10:18.284
Like that!

10:18.618 --> 10:21.078
No I mean, I got that part...

10:21.162 --> 10:24.790
Speaking of names,
who is Former Officer Kaizaki?

10:25.082 --> 10:27.918
Oh, I believe that's Kaizaki's mother.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.172
Huh? Is being a Dragon Pilot hereditary?

10:31.297 --> 10:33.174
No, that's not it.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.259
But before you came,

10:35.343 --> 10:38.638
Kaizaki was the leading
Dragon Pilot candidate.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.681
Before I came?

10:41.015 --> 10:45.728
Yes. Commander Sosoda and Flight Leader
Kakiyasu had high hopes for her--

10:48.022 --> 10:49.315
Ah, I'm sorry!

10:49.732 --> 10:51.400
You shouldn't feel burdened--

10:51.484 --> 10:53.486
What a truly amazing person she is,

10:53.694 --> 10:54.528
Nao!

10:55.863 --> 10:58.282
Normally, I wouldn't think it's possible!

10:58.366 --> 11:01.744
But to think that she extended a hand
to a rival who destroyed her dreams!

11:02.536 --> 11:04.705
I... I...

11:05.539 --> 11:06.582
Ah!

11:09.418 --> 11:10.503
Yogurt?

11:10.878 --> 11:13.506
Yeah! It's been in my pocket
since yesterday.

11:13.589 --> 11:14.423
Yech...

11:14.674 --> 11:17.677
And I've just realized
something extraordinary!

11:18.135 --> 11:22.890
The Joa lady was using this yogurt's
catchphrase to tell me to root for Nao!

11:23.224 --> 11:27.937
I shall support the stomach.
Nay, I shall support Nao!

11:28.020 --> 11:31.482
W-What the hell is she saying?

11:31.899 --> 11:34.402
That's why I'm sorry, Otofu,

11:34.485 --> 11:37.405
but could you let Nao
ride you instead of me?

11:38.447 --> 11:40.574
-A-Amakasu...
-It'll be great!

11:40.658 --> 11:42.827
Nao may look like a child,

11:42.910 --> 11:44.578
-Um...
-but she acts her age,

11:44.912 --> 11:46.831
and she has good judgment!

11:47.164 --> 11:50.501
On top of that, I'm not as eager
to be a Dragon Pilot.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.670
You'll see that she's a kind person.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.840
And you shouldn't judge a person
before you eat her, Otofu!

11:55.923 --> 11:58.426
Amakasu! I think
that's unnecessary to say...

12:02.972 --> 12:04.974
I don't need your damn charity!

12:08.269 --> 12:12.398
You... half-assed wench!

12:16.235 --> 12:19.071
Oh no... did Nao hear everything?!

12:19.530 --> 12:20.573
Otofu!

12:20.656 --> 12:22.533
What should I do?!

12:29.915 --> 12:31.834
Wait, Otofu!

12:32.752 --> 12:35.254
Otofu!

12:39.842 --> 12:41.218
U-Um...

12:45.556 --> 12:47.808
I shouldn't talk to her.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.519
My frankness only hurts people.

12:50.603 --> 12:54.231
I can't mimic the same kind of attack
on Nao after hurting her.

12:54.440 --> 12:59.153
We'll both calm down after a night
and Nao's stance should soften.

13:00.070 --> 13:03.157
<i>Why do I have to be calm?!</i>

13:03.282 --> 13:06.285
<i>The only one who's gonna calm down</i>
<i>is you, dumbass.</i>

13:08.204 --> 13:09.705
<i>Heh heh, time to cut it.</i>

13:10.039 --> 13:11.916
<i>Snip. Shock!</i>

13:13.375 --> 13:16.921
<i>Ah, I can't dance anymore.</i>

13:18.047 --> 13:19.924
I've got it.

13:20.007 --> 13:24.720
Hiso Maso!

13:26.680 --> 13:30.392
Now then, shall we begin
viewing the suit fittings?

13:37.191 --> 13:38.400
Oh.

13:38.776 --> 13:39.652
<i>Bon.</i>

13:39.902 --> 13:40.986
<i>Tres bien.</i>

13:41.195 --> 13:42.154
<i>Wunderbar.</i>

13:44.365 --> 13:47.535
What do you call
this kind of shaming for fun?

13:47.618 --> 13:52.623
I've taken fantasy into reality
from head to toe on Hisone's body.

13:52.790 --> 13:56.043
Please, enough with
the unpleasant visceral expressions!

13:56.126 --> 13:57.586
Looking good, Amakasu.

13:57.711 --> 13:59.922
Everything looks good on you, doesn't it?

14:00.005 --> 14:01.298
Commander Sosoda now, too?!

14:01.841 --> 14:04.134
Try on the next suit.

14:04.969 --> 14:08.722
Now then, let's have you
board the OTF so we may collect data.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.684
Do I really have to wear this suit?

14:27.449 --> 14:29.034
What are you doing?

14:29.451 --> 14:31.412
Oh, um, nothing.

14:38.752 --> 14:41.046
Hand it over, 3rd Class Kaizaki.

14:47.553 --> 14:51.265
Doing this will only make you miserable.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.809
If it were Former Officer Kaizaki,

14:53.893 --> 14:55.436
she would be fair and graceful--

14:55.519 --> 14:57.521
Please stop saying Mama's name.

14:58.522 --> 15:01.358
If you've got a problem,
we can rotate you.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.818
You can request it anytime.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.531
I quit.

15:08.407 --> 15:11.160
I quit the Gifu Air Base!

15:15.289 --> 15:17.458
Don't be so down about it!

15:17.625 --> 15:20.419
We aren't men without
our hunting instinct!

15:20.836 --> 15:22.254
It's my pride.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.298
-If a woman cooks well--
-Huh?

15:26.175 --> 15:27.885
Oh, Nao!

15:27.968 --> 15:29.887
Are you finally running into my arms--

15:31.513 --> 15:32.598
-Eh?
-Hey!

15:32.681 --> 15:33.557
Hey, wait!

15:34.975 --> 15:36.852
My bike!

15:39.605 --> 15:41.607
Nao's gone off the rails!

15:44.276 --> 15:48.280
<i>It turns out that Nao</i>
<i>left on the bike she stole,</i>

15:48.572 --> 15:51.909
<i>and didn't even come back</i>
<i>the following night.</i>

15:52.826 --> 15:55.371
<i>The number you are trying to reach</i>
<i>is unavailable.</i>

15:55.704 --> 15:57.414
-A deserter, eh?
-My bike...

15:57.498 --> 15:58.374
What a problem.

15:58.791 --> 16:02.169
This is why we've got a problem with
the all-women Dragon Pilots.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.422
They do as they please.
We're sick of cleaning up after them!

16:05.965 --> 16:07.216
My deepest apologies.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.094
But I wonder if she'll be okay?

16:10.678 --> 16:13.472
She doesn't seem
like she has a fat wallet.

16:13.597 --> 16:14.682
Wallet?

16:14.974 --> 16:17.768
A search party costs about a million.

16:17.893 --> 16:21.188
The fee comes out
of the deserter's pocket of course.

16:21.271 --> 16:24.692
Nao will be in that much debt
at such a young age?

16:25.275 --> 16:27.778
What if she gets fired
from the Air Self-Defense Force?

16:27.861 --> 16:29.947
She'd need a night job that pays well,

16:30.030 --> 16:33.534
but with her childish looks,
she'd need to falsify her record.

16:33.617 --> 16:35.577
-But before that...
-She talking to herself?

16:35.661 --> 16:38.622
-We can hear it all.
-Isn't she saying some terrible things?

16:38.706 --> 16:39.999
You're one to talk.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.625
Let me say one more thing!

16:42.209 --> 16:47.006
Let me and OTF Otofu take over
the search for Nao!

16:48.382 --> 16:50.342
If we do that, it won't cost any money.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.721
And you think you can so easily
maneuver the OTF to fly?!

16:54.638 --> 16:57.975
What if we deploy it tonight in the dark?

16:58.308 --> 16:59.810
Commander Sosoda!

17:00.019 --> 17:01.478
Thank you very much!

17:05.149 --> 17:06.483
-Oh.
-Mr. Ikushima!

17:06.775 --> 17:07.901
Oh, Hisone.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.988
-You know, I'm satisfied with--
-Is that a suit?!

17:13.824 --> 17:14.992
I'm borrowing this.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.620
So she picked that suit.

17:18.912 --> 17:20.289
That's just like her.

17:20.706 --> 17:21.999
Nice sense.

17:22.583 --> 17:23.751
Otofu!

17:24.251 --> 17:25.252
Hm? Ah!

17:25.419 --> 17:28.630
Amakasu... your suit...

17:29.715 --> 17:32.593
All right, Otofu. Hurry up and swallow me!

17:34.720 --> 17:35.637
What's wrong?

17:36.221 --> 17:37.931
I want to find Nao!

17:38.223 --> 17:39.266
Please.

17:42.644 --> 17:43.479
Huh?

17:51.945 --> 17:53.030
I wonder if

17:53.781 --> 17:55.324
Otofu and Nao

17:55.991 --> 17:57.284
share the same feelings?

18:00.287 --> 18:01.288
I'm sorry!

18:01.747 --> 18:04.625
If I'm asked if I want to be
a Dragon Pilot,

18:04.792 --> 18:07.878
I still don't actively and passionately
feel that I want to.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.756
You're supposed to lie and say you do...

18:10.881 --> 18:16.720
But I do believe I found
something only I can do!

18:17.221 --> 18:18.222
I apologize!

18:18.472 --> 18:20.891
Please forgive my half-witted remarks!

18:21.725 --> 18:23.268
And please,

18:23.352 --> 18:25.646
grant my wish, Otofu!

18:27.523 --> 18:29.441
Otofu!

18:34.780 --> 18:36.448
<i>Mambo Viking 01.</i>

18:37.116 --> 18:39.952
<i>Wind 090 at 7.</i>

18:40.077 --> 18:42.913
<i>Runway 28 cleared for takeoff.</i>

18:43.288 --> 18:45.833
C-Cleared for takeoff.

18:51.588 --> 18:54.133
Ma... so... tan?

18:55.968 --> 18:59.054
By chance, is your name Masotan?

19:05.602 --> 19:06.770
I see.

19:06.895 --> 19:07.729
Well then.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.606
Let's go, Masotan!

19:09.898 --> 19:11.108
Let's go find Nao!

19:30.669 --> 19:34.173
I say that, but how are we gonna find her?

19:39.803 --> 19:41.430
M-Masotan!

19:53.817 --> 19:56.612
It hurts! Someone help me please...

19:57.321 --> 19:58.363
Mama...

20:18.884 --> 20:21.053
We're here to take you home, Nao.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.306
You're... injured!

20:25.432 --> 20:26.850
It's just a scratch.

20:27.559 --> 20:31.188
Masotan, sorry, but could you take Nao?

20:31.271 --> 20:32.522
Masotan?

20:32.940 --> 20:36.944
The base is nearby so at this distance,
you won't melt without a suit.

20:38.528 --> 20:39.404
I can't.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.198
It'll be okay.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.659
-I can just walk--
-That's not it!

20:47.329 --> 20:49.873
He won't swallow me up.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.667
That's not true.

20:51.917 --> 20:55.420
Masotan remembers your scent.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.381
That's how we found you.

20:57.839 --> 20:58.966
This guy did?

21:00.717 --> 21:02.261
It's not "this guy."

21:02.344 --> 21:03.720
Masotan.

21:05.722 --> 21:07.724
Masotan--

21:20.279 --> 21:22.489
Thank you, Masotan.

21:30.455 --> 21:34.459
As an exception, your report
will be taken care of externally.

21:34.751 --> 21:35.585
Huh?

21:35.752 --> 21:38.463
You know too much about the OTF.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.549
I will not allow you
to quit the flight team.

21:40.632 --> 21:41.883
-But--
-If you want to quit,

21:41.967 --> 21:45.053
you will pay the million yen fee
for the search party.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.430
Wait just a minute!

21:46.513 --> 21:48.473
Does that mean I can stay...

21:48.557 --> 21:51.601
In the future, we will need
many Dragon Pilots.

21:51.685 --> 21:56.440
You have cleared the first condition
requiring you to be swallowed by an OTF.

21:57.232 --> 22:00.902
You are an excellent candidate
to become a Dragon Pilot,

22:01.236 --> 22:02.279
Third Class Kaizaki.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.116
I understand how you feel.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.661
I was just like you a long time ago.

22:10.662 --> 22:11.705
Work hard.

22:13.248 --> 22:14.082
Yes, ma'am!

22:14.916 --> 22:15.834
Please excuse me!

22:17.627 --> 22:19.004
Woosh!

22:19.087 --> 22:20.213
Veer!

22:20.297 --> 22:21.798
Pew pew pew!

22:22.591 --> 22:23.425
Oh!

22:23.550 --> 22:24.926
Fire!

22:25.093 --> 22:27.387
M-Masotan! Hang in there!

22:27.471 --> 22:30.223
If you don't want that to be your fate,
then you gotta train!

22:30.807 --> 22:31.641
You got it!

22:32.059 --> 22:33.602
Is that so?

22:33.769 --> 22:37.230
Hisone Amakasu calls her OTF Masotan?

22:37.647 --> 22:38.482
Yes, sir.

22:39.566 --> 22:42.361
Calling an OTF by its true name...

22:42.944 --> 22:45.739
As I thought, she is

22:45.822 --> 22:47.657
the chosen <i>Miko.</i>

22:47.741 --> 22:49.951
TO BE CONTINUED

24:20.750 --> 24:23.253
You said you'd do it,
so take responsibility!

24:23.336 --> 24:25.464
Take responsibility, huh?

24:25.547 --> 24:27.340
Mine should be hard.

24:27.424 --> 24:29.301
Oh! Not there!

24:32.304 --> 24:33.346
Sweet.

24:41.938 --> 24:44.941
