- Let him go free.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.033
- Hey, hey, hey, hey...

12:39.100 --> 12:41.567
hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:41.633 --> 12:43.400
- "Let him go free"?

12:43.467 --> 12:45.000
The man is
a convicted killer.

12:45.066 --> 12:46.600
- He stabbed the inmate
who cut his son's tongue out.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.200
- And he's old.

12:48.266 --> 12:49.500
- He's old, Leo.

12:49.567 --> 12:51.333
- Old doesn't
necessarily mean nice.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.133
If you have any
doubts about that,

12:53.200 --> 12:55.266
spend ten minutes
with my mother-in-law.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.367
- Leo, a 31-year-old inmate

12:57.433 --> 12:59.600
costs $21,000 a year
to maintain.

12:59.667 --> 13:01.700
A senior costs
three times that amount.

13:01.767 --> 13:04.266
- Since when did you get
so interested in the budget?

13:04.333 --> 13:06.033
- Since I figured out that
the money we're gonna waste

13:06.100 --> 13:07.433
taking care of
Ricardo Alvarez

13:07.500 --> 13:08.800
could be put
to much better use.

13:08.867 --> 13:10.667
- Besides, Ricardo doesn't know
where he is

13:10.734 --> 13:12.266
or even why he's here!

13:12.333 --> 13:14.934
There is  such a thing
as criminal menopause, right?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.066
Look, he cannot commit
the crime again.

13:17.133 --> 13:18.934
The man is no longer
a threat to anybody.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.533
- Yeah, but it didn't
change what he did.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.066
And it doesn't
change his sentence.

13:22.133 --> 13:24.400
Life imprisonment
means just that.

13:24.467 --> 13:26.567
Besides, if he really
doesn't know he's in prison,

13:26.633 --> 13:29.166
then he's already free,
isn't he?

13:34.500 --> 13:35.800
- While I was growing up,

13:35.867 --> 13:39.266
both my father and
my grandfather came to Oz.

13:39.333 --> 13:42.133
You know, when I was little,
I always wondered

13:42.200 --> 13:43.900
what was so great
about prison

13:43.967 --> 13:46.367
that they'd wanna
leave us and come here.

13:47.900 --> 13:50.000
But you a kid,
you know,

13:50.066 --> 13:52.000
what do you know?

13:52.066 --> 13:53.867
- Yeah.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.767
So, the word
"grandfather,"

13:56.834 --> 13:58.467
what does the word

13:58.533 --> 14:01.333
mean to you,
emotionally?

14:01.400 --> 14:03.400
- Nothin'.

14:03.467 --> 14:05.800
Don't mean nothin'
at all to me.

14:05.867 --> 14:09.500
[chuckles]
"Pizza" means more.

14:09.567 --> 14:11.100
"Doorknob."

14:12.300 --> 14:14.333
- Would you like
"grandfather"

14:14.400 --> 14:16.066
to mean something
to you?

14:17.900 --> 14:19.033
- Yeah.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.266
- Dr. Nathan's
not sure how long

14:23.333 --> 14:25.266
your grandfather
has to live.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.834
Look.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.900
Since your father's an orderly
in the prison hospital

14:30.967 --> 14:33.000
and is gonna spend the remaining
time with your grandfather,

14:33.066 --> 14:35.100
there's no reason you can't
do the same thing.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.533
Maybe if you
take care of him

14:37.600 --> 14:39.934
you'll learn
to care for him.

14:44.066 --> 14:45.934
- You know,
in my family,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.233
Ricardo was like a god.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.300
You know, he was a legend.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.800
My grandmother used to
show me these pictures.

14:52.867 --> 14:55.266
You know, tell me stories
all about him.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.967
And I wanted--I wanted
to be like him.

14:59.033 --> 15:01.233
You know?
- Yeah.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.433
- And now I see
he's just a man.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.800
You know, he's just an old man

15:09.867 --> 15:12.934
and he's rottin' away.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.100
I don't wanna end up
like my grandfather.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.033
- You don't have to, Miguel.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.967
- Oh, really?

15:20.033 --> 15:23.433
Well, I don't see it
going down any other way.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.900
- Rebadow.

15:38.033 --> 15:40.200
I'm sorry you didn't
make it out.

15:40.266 --> 15:42.367
- It's okay.
It was worth it.

15:45.633 --> 15:46.867
The adrenaline rush,

15:46.934 --> 15:49.467
I felt 25 again
for a moment.

15:51.300 --> 15:54.367
- Here's your dinner.
- I don't want it.

15:54.433 --> 15:57.934
- Okay.
What do you want?

15:58.000 --> 16:01.166
- I'd like a few years
at the end of my life

16:01.233 --> 16:03.200
to be free.

16:11.166 --> 16:12.900
- Do we care for people
when they're sick

16:12.967 --> 16:15.567
'cause we actually
care about them?

16:15.633 --> 16:18.400
- [mumbles] Guys...

16:18.467 --> 16:21.600
- Or do we care for them
because when our time comes

16:21.667 --> 16:23.233
we want someone
to care for us?

16:26.066 --> 16:28.100
Or does it matter?

16:30.734 --> 16:32.700
At least you got
your health!

16:32.767 --> 16:35.066
Don't you hate it
when people say that?!

16:35.133 --> 16:37.700
I mean, you lose your job,
you lose your wife,

16:37.767 --> 16:39.266
you're in prison

16:39.333 --> 16:40.767
and some punk-ass
do-gooder says,

16:40.834 --> 16:42.233
"At least you got
your health!"

16:42.300 --> 16:44.300
Like that's supposed
to make you feel better!

16:44.367 --> 16:45.633
So what if I'm broke?

16:45.700 --> 16:47.533
So what if some dealer
wants to cap my ass?

16:47.600 --> 16:49.200
At least I ain't
got a tumor!

16:49.266 --> 16:52.667
I swear the next person that
says "A.L.Y.G.Y.H." to me,

16:52.734 --> 16:56.166
I'ma make sure they ain't got
their health much longer.

16:56.233 --> 16:58.934
- You say you were
having nightmares.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.734
Can you remember
any of them?

17:00.800 --> 17:03.133
- No. Ow.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.033
- What's the matter?

17:05.100 --> 17:07.133
- My tooth hurts.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.934
It's been hurting
for a week.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.834
- Then go see a dentist.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.533
- No.

17:12.600 --> 17:13.734
- Why?

17:13.800 --> 17:15.333
- I hate the dentist.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.266
- All dentists, or just
Dr. Cochern in particular?

17:18.333 --> 17:20.033
- The concept of dentists.

17:20.100 --> 17:21.567
- Well, then what?

17:21.633 --> 17:23.767
You prefer
the concept of pain?

17:23.834 --> 17:25.900
Make an appointment, Groves.

17:25.967 --> 17:28.533
Okay? Okay?

17:31.100 --> 17:32.734
- Oh, God.
- What?

17:32.800 --> 17:34.033
- Oh, sweet Jesus.

17:34.100 --> 17:35.967
Donald Groves is
coming in to see me.

17:36.033 --> 17:37.600
- So?

17:37.667 --> 17:40.066
- Gloria, he ate
his parents.

17:40.133 --> 17:42.567
I'm not sticking
my fingers in his mouth.

17:42.633 --> 17:44.166
My fingers
are my livelihood.

17:44.233 --> 17:46.166
- He's been working
in the ward as an orderly.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.533
He seems harmless.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.667
- So you'd stick your fingers
in his mouth?

17:49.734 --> 17:51.066
- If I had to.

17:51.133 --> 17:53.800
If he's in pain, you have to.
- No, I don't!

17:53.867 --> 17:55.400
- What about
the Hippocratic oath?

17:55.467 --> 17:57.700
- Dentists don't take
the Hippocratic oath.

17:57.767 --> 18:00.266
We don't make
any promises to anybody.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.567
How's that gas working?

18:05.633 --> 18:08.633
You feel happy, calm?

18:08.700 --> 18:10.834
- Uh-huh.
- Good.

18:12.333 --> 18:15.467
Okay.
Let's have a look.

18:15.533 --> 18:17.533
Open your mouth.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.900
Wide.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.433
Wider.
Wider.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.367
- It can't
get any wider.

18:24.433 --> 18:26.400
- All righty then.

18:28.867 --> 18:30.900
They look fine.
- It hurts.

18:30.967 --> 18:33.200
- It's probably nothing.
Don't be a baby.

18:33.266 --> 18:34.233
- Who you calling
a baby?

18:34.300 --> 18:36.467
- Nobody.

18:36.533 --> 18:39.000
Forget it--
forget I said anything.

18:39.066 --> 18:40.834
Ah-ha.

18:40.900 --> 18:42.834
There is a tooth
that's rotted out.

18:42.900 --> 18:45.166
So we're going to
have to pull it.

18:45.233 --> 18:46.700
That means I have to
take a needle

18:46.767 --> 18:48.300
and inject some novocaine
in your mouth.

18:48.367 --> 18:50.533
- I hate needles.
- Everybody does.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.166
Then I have to drill.

18:52.233 --> 18:53.700
- I hate drills.

18:53.767 --> 18:55.900
- Right now, so do I.

18:55.967 --> 18:59.100
Right now I wish there were
holistic dentistry.

18:59.166 --> 19:00.333
- I'm in pain.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.900
- Well, you're going to be
in a lot more

19:01.967 --> 19:03.467
before we're finished.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.400
But after that,
you won't have any pain.

19:05.467 --> 19:07.500
See, if I cause you pain,

19:07.567 --> 19:10.834
it's not my fault,
so don't bite my head off.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.567
I mean--

19:13.633 --> 19:15.900
- I know what you mean.
- Okay.

19:15.967 --> 19:17.900
Let's get started.

19:17.967 --> 19:21.066
First,
the Novocain.

19:21.133 --> 19:22.967
Open wide.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.734
Carol?

19:31.800 --> 19:34.467
Could you give me
a hand here, please?

19:40.967 --> 19:42.500
- This is my tooth.

19:42.567 --> 19:44.400
It was in my head.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.600
This tooth and I have been
together since we were kids.

19:51.967 --> 19:54.367
This tooth
chewed on my mom.

19:58.166 --> 20:01.200
- You should sell it.
- Sell it?

20:01.266 --> 20:02.533
- Sell it.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.266
The tooth from the mouth
of Donald Groves.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.133
You know how much that's worth
on the open market?

20:06.200 --> 20:07.333
- How much?

20:07.400 --> 20:08.633
- Plenty.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.166
- Who would wanna
buy my tooth?

20:10.233 --> 20:12.000
- Collectors.
- Collectors?

20:12.066 --> 20:15.100
- Collectors.
People collect everything.

20:15.166 --> 20:17.166
Stamps,
salt and pepper shakers,

20:17.233 --> 20:18.967
world's fair tchotchkes.

20:19.033 --> 20:20.834
Some people collect
crime stuff.

20:20.900 --> 20:22.500
Lindbergh ladder,

20:22.567 --> 20:24.867
Ted Bundy's
toenail clippings,

20:24.934 --> 20:28.333
and this.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.200
- We'd have to get
to a fence, though, right?

20:30.266 --> 20:31.467
- We're in prison.

20:31.533 --> 20:32.967
How hard's that gonna be?

20:33.033 --> 20:36.133
- But Ross, if we get
a good price...

20:38.467 --> 20:41.066
I still got 30 more.

20:41.133 --> 20:43.000
- The mind is just
like the body.

20:43.066 --> 20:45.934
It's under
constant assault.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.934
From fear and hate

20:49.000 --> 20:51.300
and our old pal
loneliness.

20:51.367 --> 20:54.266
These stings are as deadly

20:54.333 --> 20:56.133
The mind

20:56.200 --> 20:58.266
is just

20:58.333 --> 21:00.500
The fact that the mind
can survive

21:00.567 --> 21:03.200
is a miracle.
