00:32.433 --> 00:33.667
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE TIME

00:33.701 --> 00:35.369
THESE HAVE TO BE
POST-MARKED TODAY.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.638
OK, I'M WRITING YOUR
COLLEGE ESSAYS FOR YOU,

00:37.671 --> 00:39.207
AND YOU'RE CALLING ME
AN IDIOT?

00:39.240 --> 00:40.574
OK, YOU'RE NOT AN IDIOT.

00:40.608 --> 00:43.277
YOU'RE JUST GOING SLOW
LIKE AN IDIOT.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.613
HEY, I GOT AN EARLY
ACCEPTANCE TO YALE.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.348
CONGRATULATIONS.

"WHAT'S THAT, BRAD?

00:51.719 --> 00:53.087
YALE! GOOD FOR YOU!"

00:53.121 --> 00:55.256
OH, MY GOD, BRAD!

00:55.289 --> 00:57.758
CONGRATULATIONS!

00:57.791 --> 00:59.860
IT'S REALLY, REALLY

BUT THESE HAVE TO BE

01:01.729 --> 01:03.564

01:03.597 --> 01:06.100
OK, OK, LET'S BUST IT
YALIE STYLE.Ê ÓF2Ö

01:06.134 --> 01:06.967
OK.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.838
WHAT WOULD I SAY IS
MY BIGGEST WEAKNESS?

01:10.871 --> 01:12.573
PROCRASTINATION?

01:12.606 --> 01:15.276
NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.043
NO, NO, NO. NO.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.044
AW, COME ON, BABY,
IT'S A KEEPSAKE.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.580
IT'S THE ONLY THING
I HAVE LEFT
FROM THE BAR.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.681
OH, COME ON, EDDIE.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.117
AMY BOUGHT THE BAR.
DIDN'T THE JUKEBOX
COME WITH IT?

01:23.151 --> 01:25.253
SHE SAID ALL THE SONGS
ON IT WERE WHACK.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.688
I WAS LIKE, "WHACK?"
WE'RE SAYING
"WHACK" NOW?

01:27.721 --> 01:29.357
ALL RIGHT, SO SOME
OF THE SONGS SUCK,

01:29.390 --> 01:31.359
BUT AFTER ALL THE YEARS
WE'VE LISTENED TO THEM,

01:31.392 --> 01:32.426
THEY'VE GOT
SENTIMENTAL VALUE.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.627
"COME ON,
FEEL THE NOISE"?

01:33.661 --> 01:36.330
YEAH, COME ON, BABY,
FEEL THE NOISE.

01:36.364 --> 01:37.565
OH, I WILL FEEL
THAT NOISE.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.601
I'LL FEEL THAT NOISE
AS LONG AS YOU ROCK ME
LIKE A HURRICANE.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.370
I'M GONNA ROCK YOU
LIKE A HURRICANE.

01:42.403 --> 01:43.837
HA HA!
COME ON.

01:43.871 --> 01:47.141
GO, RUN!
RUN LIKE THE WIND!

01:47.175 --> 01:49.610
WHAT IS THAT
ALL ABOUT?

01:49.643 --> 01:50.578
OH, YOU KNOW JIMMY.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.381
ALWAYS PUTTING
STUFF OFF TILL
THE LAST MINUTE.

01:53.414 --> 01:57.385
SEAN, I THOUGHT YOU
WERE GONNA BABY-PROOF
THE HOUSE THIS WEEK.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.887
YEAH, YEAH, I AM,
BUT THE BABY'S NOT
COMING FOR 5 MONTHS.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.857
WE GOT PLENTY OF TIME.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON,
GO, JETS!

02:06.727 --> 02:07.961
GO, METS!

02:07.995 --> 02:11.665
SEAN, I THOUGHT YOU
WERE GONNA BABY-PROOF
THE HOUSE THIS WEEK.

02:11.699 --> 02:14.335
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
I'M ON IT.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.172
WHAT ARE YOU WRITING?

02:18.206 --> 02:19.673
MY VALEDICTORIAN
SPEECH.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.442
"AS WE SET SAIL
OFF TO ADULTHOOD,

02:21.475 --> 02:26.280
WE MUST REMEMBER THAT
EVERY JOURNEY BEGINS
WITH ONE SMALL STEP"?

02:26.314 --> 02:27.615
YES.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.717
I THOUGHT WE WERE SAILING.

02:29.750 --> 02:30.518
WE ARE.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.452
SO WE WOULDN'T START OFF
WITH A STEP.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.754
YEAH, WE HAVE TO STEP
ONTO THE BOAT, BUDDY.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.723
IT'S A MIXED METAPHOR.

02:35.756 --> 02:36.790
OK, FINE.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.826
EVERY JOURNEY OF SAILING

02:38.859 --> 02:43.697
BEGINS WITH
ONE SMALL BREEZE.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.799
OH, LIL,
YOU GOT A LETTER.

02:45.833 --> 02:46.634
FROM WHO?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.669
SOUTHERN CONNECTICUT
STATE UNIVERSITY.

02:48.702 --> 02:49.770
REALLY?

02:49.803 --> 02:50.938
WHAT'S IT SAY?

02:50.971 --> 02:52.473
HOW LAZY ARE YOU?

02:52.506 --> 02:55.943
I'M NOT,
I'M JUST NERVOUS, OK?

02:58.412 --> 02:59.046
OH, MY GOD.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.782
OH, MY GOD,
I GOT INTO SCSU.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.385
YOU GOT IN!
CONGRATULATIONS!

03:04.418 --> 03:06.587
YEAH...THANKS.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.321
OH, GOD.

03:07.355 --> 03:08.756
WHAT "OH, GOD"?
YOU GOT ACCEPTED

03:08.789 --> 03:10.358
TO THE SCHOOL
YOU WANTED TO GO TO!

03:10.391 --> 03:13.394
YEAH. YEAH, BECAUSE
SCSU IS IN NEW HAVEN,

03:13.427 --> 03:16.597
WHICH IS WHERE YALE IS,
WHICH IS WHERE BRAD
IS GOING.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.699
RIGHT, WHICH IS WHAT
YOU WANTED, ISN'T IT?

03:18.732 --> 03:22.770
YEAH. YEAH, IT WAS.
IT IS, IT IS...

03:22.803 --> 03:24.037
I GUESS. I JUST...

03:24.071 --> 03:26.874
WHEN I DIDN'T HEAR
FROM THEM, I ASSUMED
I'D BE GOING TO RUTGERS.

03:26.907 --> 03:31.312
BUT I THOUGHT YOU
WANTED TO GO TO SCSU
SO YOU COULD BE WITH BRAD.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.513
WELL, I THOUGHT SO, TOO,

03:32.546 --> 03:36.784
BUT AM I GONNA PICK
A COLLEGE JUST SO
I CAN BE WITH BRAD?

03:36.817 --> 03:38.686
RIGHT, BUT IF YOU
WENT TO RUTGERS,

03:38.719 --> 03:39.587
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'D
NEVER SEE HIM.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.755
I MEAN, IT'S ONLY
2 HOURS AWAY FROM YALE.

03:41.789 --> 03:45.326
THAT'S TRUE, BUT
MAYBE THOSE 2 HOURS

03:45.359 --> 03:48.829
WILL BE THE 2 HOURS
THAT HE MEETS ANOTHER GIRL.

03:48.862 --> 03:49.597
HMM.

03:49.630 --> 03:53.701
WHO CARES?
LIKE I'M THAT INSECURE.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.869
BUT WHAT IF SHE'S
SOME HOT BRAIN CHICK?

03:55.903 --> 03:58.906
I MEAN, WHAT IF SHE
HOOKS HIM BY READING
HIM EROTIC POETRY

03:58.939 --> 04:02.710
FROM, LIKE, THE NEGATIVE
3RD CENTURY OR SOMETHING?

04:02.743 --> 04:03.711
THAT BRAINY BITCH.

04:03.744 --> 04:08.282
WHAT AM I DOING?
BRAD AND I ARE
GREAT TOGETHER.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.950
AND I DON'T WANT
TO HURT HIM.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.720
BUT THIS IS
A MAJOR LIFE PLAN.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.756
I MEAN, YOU DON'T
MARRY YOUR HIGH SCHOOL
BOYFRIEND.

04:15.789 --> 04:21.962
UH, YOU DON'T NECESSARILY
NOT MARRY YOUR HIGH
SCHOOL BOYFRIEND.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.731
I MEAN, ON PURPOSE, MOM.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.367
YOU WERE LUCKY.
YOU GOT PREGNANT.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.768
DIDN'T HAVE TO
MAKE A CHOICE.

04:27.801 --> 04:33.574
OH, YEAH, ONE OF THE MANY
BENEFITS OF TEEN PREGNANCY.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.978
HEY, SEAN.
HEY, ED.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.847
HEY, UNCLE EDDIE.
WHAT'S THAT?

04:39.880 --> 04:42.650
IT'S YOUR
GRADUATION PRESENT.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.653
WHAT

04:48.822 --> 04:49.623
OH, MY GOD.

04:49.657 --> 04:53.361
NO WAY. IT'S A STEREO.
THAT'S AWESOME!

04:53.394 --> 04:56.397
SO, ED, WE HAVE TO
SCRATCH THE SERIAL NUMBERS
OFF THIS THING?

04:56.430 --> 04:57.998
NO, WE DO NOT.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.901
COME ON, HELP ME
WITH THE SPEAKERS.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.975
WHOA, HEY!
WHOSE CAR IS THIS?

05:08.008 --> 05:08.776
IT'S MINE.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.779
ED, YOU CAN'T AFFORD
A CAR LIKE THIS.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.382
I MADE SOME MONEY
WHEN AMY BOUGHT THE BAR.

05:14.415 --> 05:17.117
WE BOTH DID.
VERY LITTLE MONEY,
WHICH WE SPLIT EVENLY.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.854
HOW THE HELL ARE YOU
DRIVING THIS
AND I'M DRIVING THAT?

05:21.922 --> 05:22.956
HERE'S THE BEAUTIFUL PART.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.859
AMY TURNED AROUND
AND SOLD THE BAR.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.596
SHE TRIPLED HER MONEY.

05:28.629 --> 05:29.797
OH, MY GOD.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.400
AND SINCE ME AND HER
ARE LIVING TOGETHER NOW,

05:32.433 --> 05:35.669
WE SORT OF POOLED
OUR ASSETS.

05:35.703 --> 05:38.372
IT'S GREAT, RIGHT?

05:40.040 --> 05:42.543
IT'S FANTASTIC.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.144
IT'S GREAT. IT'S REALLY...

05:44.177 --> 05:46.380
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE!

06:05.265 --> 06:07.468
I'M SORRY. BOOM BOX.
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.437
WHY ARE YOU CARRYING
THAT THING?

06:09.470 --> 06:12.005
BABY, I DIDN'T WANT
TO LEAVE IT IN THE CAR--

06:12.039 --> 06:13.206
OH, GOD, EXCUSE ME.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.776
WHY DID YOU TAKE IT
OUT OF OUR HOUSE AND
PUT IT IN THE CAR?

06:15.809 --> 06:16.810
MUST WE OVERANALYZE
EVERYTHING?

06:16.844 --> 06:20.080
OK, CAN'T WE JUST SIT
AND ENJOY LILY'S GRADUATION?

06:20.113 --> 06:22.550
YES, FINE. I NEED THE
CAR IMMEDIATELY AFTER.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.985
MY ECONOMICS FINAL'S
AT 3:00.

06:25.018 --> 06:25.653
HEY, DAD.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.821
HEY, SON,
THAT SEAT'S SAVED.

06:27.855 --> 06:28.589
FOR WHO?

06:28.622 --> 06:30.057
SOMEBODY ASKED ME
TO SAVE A SEAT.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.726
YOU'RE SAVING A SEAT
FOR A STRANGER?

06:32.760 --> 06:34.995
I'M SAVING THE SEAT
FOR MY GIRLFRIEND, OK?

06:35.028 --> 06:37.798
THE ADS IN THIS PROGRAM
ARE IN COLOR!

06:37.831 --> 06:39.767
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

06:39.800 --> 06:40.768
FINE. NOW YOU KNOW.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.737
WOW, WALT, IF SHE'S COMING
TO LILY'S GRADUATION,

06:43.771 --> 06:44.705
THIS MUST BE SERIOUS.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.039
WE DON'T HAVE TO
DWELL ON THIS.

06:46.073 --> 06:49.810
OK, DAD, JUST HOW LONG
DID YOU THINK YOU COULD
KEEP THIS A SECRET?

06:49.843 --> 06:50.744
IT WASN'T SO HARD.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.213
I'VE KEPT IT A SECRET
FROM YOU FOR 7 MONTHS.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.683
7 MONTHS?
7 MONTHS?

06:55.716 --> 06:56.750
7 MONTHS?

06:56.784 --> 06:59.620
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU KNOW,
EVERY TIME I CALL THE HOUSE,

06:59.653 --> 07:00.488
YOU KNOW, A WOMAN ANSWERS.

07:00.521 --> 07:03.123
YOU ALWAYS SAY IT'S
YOUR CLEANING LADY.

07:03.156 --> 07:03.991
YOU LIED TO US?

07:04.024 --> 07:05.993
NO, I'VE NEVER LIED
TO YOU, NEVER ONCE.

07:06.026 --> 07:10.030
OH, MY GOD, DAD,
YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH
THE CLEANING LADY.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.364
SHE'S GOT A NAME!

07:11.398 --> 07:16.236
WOW. DO YOU REALIZE THIS
IS THE LAST TIME WE'LL
BE IN THIS HALLWAY?

07:16.269 --> 07:19.740
WE HAVE TO COME BACK
TOMORROW TO GIVE BACK
OUR CAPS AND GOWNS.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.074
NO, NO, THAT'S
IN THE CAFETERIA.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.644
THIS IS THE LAST TIME
WE'RE GONNA BE
IN THIS HALLWAY

07:23.677 --> 07:26.480
HERE, OUTSIDE OF ANNEX 2.

07:27.548 --> 07:30.017
AT LEAST WE'RE ALWAYS
GONNA BE TOGETHER.

07:30.050 --> 07:33.053
YEP. NEW HAVEN,
HERE WE COME.

07:33.086 --> 07:37.057
YEAH, IT'S LIKE YOU
AND I WILL HAVE A
"NEW HAVEN" FOR OUR LOVE.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.960
YEAH, IT'S LIKE WE'RE
NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER,

07:39.993 --> 07:41.529
LIKE NOTHING'S CHANGED.

07:41.562 --> 07:44.131
YEP! NO CHANGE.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.098
NONE.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.034
AND WHY SHOULD
THINGS CHANGE?

07:47.067 --> 07:50.804
WE'RE AT A HUGE CROSSROADS
IN OUR LIFE, YOU KNOW.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.040
DOESN'T MEAN THINGS
HAVE TO CHANGE.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.475
HELL, NO!

07:57.077 --> 08:00.047
HOW CAN OUR DAUGHTER BE
GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.248
WE'RE WAY TOO YOUNG
FOR THIS.

08:01.281 --> 08:05.519
IT SEEMS LIKE WE JUST
GRADUATED FROM THIS
PLACE. REMEMBER?

08:05.553 --> 08:06.820
OH, YEAH, I REMEMBER.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.623
YOU WERE PREGNANT
WITH LILY AND...

08:09.657 --> 08:11.725
YOU WANTED ME DEAD.

08:11.759 --> 08:12.760
YEAH.

08:12.793 --> 08:16.096
NOW YOU KNOCKED
ME UP FOR LILY'S
GRADUATION, TOO.

08:16.129 --> 08:19.099
THERE'S A CERTAIN
POETRY TO THAT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

08:19.132 --> 08:23.203
AH, MAYBE
A DIRTY LIMERICK.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.606
IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?

08:25.639 --> 08:28.108
NO, MA'AM!

08:31.344 --> 08:36.183
SEE, THAT'S THE KIND
OF THING THAT MIGHT HAVE
TIPPED US OFF, DAD.

08:36.216 --> 08:40.087
UH, MARICRUZ,
THESE ARE MY BOYS,
EDDIE AND SEAN.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.256
THAT'S SEAN'S WIFE
CLAUDIA, THERE'S JIMMY,

08:43.290 --> 08:44.925
AND HENRY'S SOMEWHERE.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.860
IT'S A REAL PLEASURE--

08:46.894 --> 08:48.195
OH, GOD--BATTERIES.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.897
WHY DID YOU BRING
THAT THING?

08:49.930 --> 08:51.098
WHY? 'CAUSE I JUST--

08:51.131 --> 08:52.165
IF I WANTED TO--

08:52.199 --> 08:58.005
OK. LAST WEEK
I WENT TO SCHOOL
TO PICK UP HENRY...

08:58.038 --> 09:00.073
MR. FINNERTY.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.109
SISTER HELEN.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.912
I KNOW WHAT YOUR
DAUGHTER'S UP TO?

09:04.945 --> 09:05.613
EXCUSE ME?

09:05.646 --> 09:07.347
DON'T PLAY DUMB,
MR. FINNERTY.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.116
NEXT WEEK
IS GRADUATION.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.184
EVERY YEAR THE SENIORS
PLAY A PRANK

09:11.218 --> 09:12.519
TO DISRUPT MY
COMMENCEMENT SPEECH.

09:12.552 --> 09:16.857
LAST YEAR THEY DROPPED
PIG'S BLOOD ON MYSELF
AND MONSIGNOR REILLY.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.826
LIKE IN CARRIE?

09:18.859 --> 09:20.694
THAT WAS A PROM.

09:20.728 --> 09:24.832
I KNOW. WAIT A MINUTE.
ACTUAL PIG'S BLOOD?

09:24.865 --> 09:27.267
FINE, IT WAS
MARINARA SAUCE.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.270
EITHER WAY,
MR. FINNERTY,
I'M NOT NAIVE.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.139
THERE'S A PRANK BEING
PLANNED THIS YEAR,

09:32.172 --> 09:34.107
AND I'M CERTAIN LILY
IS THE RINGLEADER.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.009
SISTER HELEN, LILY
IS A GOOD KID

09:36.043 --> 09:39.980
AND I FIND IT HARD
TO BELIEVE THAT YOU--
A NUN, OF ALL PEOPLE--

09:40.013 --> 09:43.751
WOULD STAND HERE
AND MAKE SUCH
BASELESS ACCUSATIONS!

09:43.784 --> 09:46.153
NOW, I'M GONNA FIND
MY DAUGHTER,

09:46.186 --> 09:47.020
AND I'M GONNA ASK HER,

09:47.054 --> 09:50.123
AND WHEN SHE TELLS ME
THAT YOU'RE WRONG,

09:50.157 --> 09:53.193
I DEMAND A FULL APOLOGY.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.427
WELL, IF I'M WRONG
ABOUT LILY,

09:54.461 --> 09:57.898
I'LL DO NAKED SOMERSAULTS
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE
SENIOR CLASS

09:57.931 --> 09:59.967
WHILE I'M HANDING OUT
THEIR DIPLOMAS.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.137
AN APOLOGY WOULD DO
JUST FINE, THANK YOU.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.674
I WAS BEING SARCASTIC!

10:06.707 --> 10:09.076
I KNOW!

10:09.109 --> 10:10.110
LILY?
YEAH.

10:10.143 --> 10:13.714
ARE YOU PLANNING
ON PULLING A PRANK
AT GRADUATION?

10:13.747 --> 10:14.848
NO.

10:14.882 --> 10:17.184
DON'T LIE TO ME.
ARE YOU PULLING
A PRANK AT GRADUATION?

10:17.217 --> 10:17.885
NO!

10:17.918 --> 10:19.987
OK, I'VE GOT SOME
GREAT IDEAS.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.955
OH, NO. WHAT
WAS YOUR IDEA?

10:21.989 --> 10:22.990
OK, YOU KNOW
HOW EVERY YEAR

10:23.023 --> 10:24.391
SISTER HELEN GIVES THE SAME
HACKNEYED SPEECH, OK?

10:24.424 --> 10:28.295
SO WHEN SHE GETS TO
THAT PART WHERE SHE SAYS,
"ATTITUDE OF GRATITUDE,"

10:28.328 --> 10:30.731
LILY'S GONNA COME
OUT AND TEAR OFF
HER GRADUATION GOWN--

10:30.764 --> 10:32.399
SHE'S GOT THAT SPARKLY
DANCE OUTFIT ON UNDERNEATH--

10:32.432 --> 10:35.769
AND THAT'S WHEN I PLAY
NEW ATTITUDE. GET IT?

10:35.803 --> 10:36.904
I GET IT.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.206
WHICH CUES THE OTHER
CHEERLEADERS TO JOIN
HER ON STAGE.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.340
OH, GOD.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.275
WHAT, BABY? IT'S
JUST A HARMLESS GAG.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.410
NO, THAT WAS THE BABY.

10:43.443 --> 10:44.745
I THINK THAT WAS
A CONTRACTION.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.179
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL?

10:46.213 --> 10:47.748
LET ME KNOW WHEN
YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE?

10:47.781 --> 10:48.982
IS THAT A ROLEX?

10:49.016 --> 10:50.383
YEAH.
OH, GOD.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.351
OH, GOD. OH, GOD.

10:51.384 --> 10:52.119
OK, LET'S GO, BABE.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.321
NO, NO, I CAN'T,
I CAN'T. NOT NOW.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.289
JIMMY CAN VIDEOTAPE
THE GRADUATION.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.959
NO, IT'S NOT
THE GRADUATION--
MY ECON FINAL.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.160
IT COUNTS FOR
MY WHOLE GRADE.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.161
YOUR PROFESSOR
WILL UNDERSTAND.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.964
THAT'S THE PROBLEM--HE'S
BEEN VERY UNDERSTANDING.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.333
I--I KIND OF
TOOK ADVANTAGE.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.302
THIS MID-TERM SHOULD TAKE
NO LONGER THAN ONE HOUR,

11:09.336 --> 11:13.941
AND IT WILL COUNT FOR
40% OF YOUR TOTAL GRADE.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.308
OH-OOHH!

11:15.342 --> 11:16.376
ARE YOU OK?

11:16.409 --> 11:20.180
WHOA. YEAH, YEAH,
I STUDIED SO HARD
FOR THIS TEST.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.215
REALLY, I'M--I'M SURE
IT'S FALSE LABOR.

11:22.249 --> 11:26.219
JUST AS LONG AS THE
CONTRACTIONS ARE
10 MINUTES AP--

11:26.253 --> 11:29.289
APART! OH, OHH.

11:29.322 --> 11:33.360
OH, GOSH.
EXCUSE ME.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.328
I SHOULD GET
THIS CHECKED.

11:37.865 --> 11:38.598
SORRY.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.000
THE TEST IS IN LESS
THAN 2 HOURS,

11:40.033 --> 11:42.335
AND I ACTUALLY
STUDIED THIS TIME.

11:42.369 --> 11:42.903
AH-OHH!

11:42.936 --> 11:43.971
A MINUTE AND 48 SECONDS.

11:44.004 --> 11:48.075
AND THIS IS ACCURATE TO
WITHIN 1/100TH OF A SECOND.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.442
HOSPITAL.
OK, LET'S GO.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.178
OH, GOD, I'M SORRY.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.846
EXCUSE ME.
BOOM BOX, BOOM BOX.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.415
AAH, SORRY, SORRY.
SORRY, BABY.

11:55.448 --> 11:58.418
BOOM BOX, PREGNANT LADY
COMING THROUGH!

11:58.451 --> 12:00.754
BOOM BOX, MAKE WAY!

12:03.223 --> 12:05.158
YEAH, MOM, SHE'S
7 POUNDS, 6 OUNCES.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.327
YEAH, SHE'S VERY CUTE.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.964
NO, I CAN'T PUT HER
ON THE PHONE.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.900
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
'CAUSE SHE'S 1 HOUR OLD.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.803
SECOND OF ALL, THE NURSES
TOOK HER FOR SOME TESTS.

12:15.836 --> 12:19.272
HEY, LISTEN, SEAN'S BACK,
SO TELL DAD I LOVE HIM.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.407
BYE.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.241
HEY.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.910
I BROUGHT SOME BALLOONS
FOR THE BABY.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.112
OH, THANK YOU.
SHE'LL LOVE 'EM.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.346
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE DID YOU GO?

12:26.379 --> 12:28.415
TO THE CIRCUS,
AND THEN McDONALD'S.

12:28.448 --> 12:32.452
LILY, WE'RE SORRY
WE HAD TO LEAVE
THE GRADUATION, OK?

12:32.485 --> 12:35.322
YEAH, WELL, I'M SORRY
YOU LEFT WITH MY MUSIC.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.992
TODAY IS TRULY THANKSGIVING.

12:39.026 --> 12:41.194
"BUT, SISTER HELEN,"
YOU SAY,

12:41.228 --> 12:45.065
"THANKSGIVING IS THE FOURTH
THURSDAY IN NOVEMBER,

12:45.098 --> 12:47.234
AND TODAY, IT IS JUNE."

12:47.267 --> 12:51.304
BUT IF WE APPROACH LIFE
WITH A NEW ATTITUDE,

12:51.338 --> 12:53.073
AN ATTITUDE OF GRATITUDE,

12:53.106 --> 12:55.976
THEN EVERY DAY
IS THANKSGIVING.

12:56.009 --> 12:59.512
SURE, THERE'S NO TURKEY,
NO STUFFING,

12:59.546 --> 13:03.316
NO PUMPKIN PIE,
NO CRANBERRY SAUCE,

13:03.350 --> 13:06.219
NO HORN OF PLENTY, NO--

13:11.058 --> 13:12.459
MUSIC.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.498
COME ON.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.039
HI.

13:26.073 --> 13:29.877
MUSIC!

13:29.910 --> 13:31.845
MAY I CONTINUE?

13:31.879 --> 13:34.114
BY ALL MEANS.

13:34.147 --> 13:38.085
NO MARSHMALLOW-FESTOONED
YAM DISH--

13:38.118 --> 13:40.487
IT'S FITTING--MY FINAL
MOMENTS OF HIGH SCHOOL

13:40.520 --> 13:44.624
IN UTTER HUMILIATION,
THANKS TO YOUR STUPID PLAN.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.692
MY STUPID PLAN

13:45.725 --> 13:48.261
WELL, HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
IF YOU HADN'T GONE ALONG

13:48.295 --> 13:50.463
WITH MY STUPID--

13:50.497 --> 13:52.499
I'M SORRY.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.068
OH, MY GOD,
YOU MISSED IT!

13:56.136 --> 13:57.938
LILY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

13:57.971 --> 14:00.107
DESTROYING THE EVIDENCE.

14:01.909 --> 14:02.910
WELL, YOU'RE NOT DONE.

14:02.943 --> 14:07.380
Sister Helen: --CRANBERRY
SAUCE, HORN OF PLENTY...

14:07.414 --> 14:09.149
AAH!

14:10.250 --> 14:11.952
HEY, WHERE'S
MY LITTLE SISTER?

14:11.985 --> 14:14.888
SHE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
HER NAME IS ROSE.

14:14.922 --> 14:18.091
MM, ROSE. LIKE THE
GIRL IN TITANIC.

14:18.125 --> 14:21.561
NO...YES, I GUESS,
BUT NOT ON PURPOSE.

14:21.594 --> 14:25.966
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
WILL THINK WE NAMED HER
AFTER TITANIC, DO YOU?

14:25.999 --> 14:27.034
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.035
WELL, WE DIDN'T.

14:28.068 --> 14:31.671
HEY, WHERE'S MY NEW NIECE?
I GOT A GIFT FOR HER.

14:31.704 --> 14:35.943
OH, THANK YOU, EDDIE.
THAT'S SO SWEET.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.210
DIAMOND EARRINGS?

14:37.244 --> 14:39.612
OH, GOD, HE'S BUYING
DIAMOND EARRINGS NOW!

14:39.646 --> 14:42.415
OH, ROSE IS A LUCKY
LITTLE BABY.

14:42.449 --> 14:45.385
ROSE FINNERTY.
VERY PRETTY.

14:45.418 --> 14:46.253
THANK YOU.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.455
IT'S LIKE YOUR HEART
WILL GO ON FOR HER.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.124
OK, WE DID NOT NAME
HER FOR TITANIC.

14:51.158 --> 14:52.192
I JUST ASSUMED.

14:52.225 --> 14:55.062
THERE ARE LOTS OF
OTHER ROSES OUT THERE,
ALL RIGHT?

14:55.095 --> 14:57.230
THERE'S ROSIE O'DONNELL.

14:57.264 --> 15:00.033
WE DIDN'T NAME HER
AFTER ROSIE O'DONNELL.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.134
THERE'S A PRECEDENT.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.569
THERE'S LOTS
OF OTHER ROSES.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.171
YEAH. AXEL ROSE.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.573
OH, IT'S NOT THE SAME.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.241
HEY, EVERYBODY.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.277
OH, LOOK, THEY
BROUGHT BALLOONS.

15:10.310 --> 15:13.546
WE FIGURED EVERYBODY
WOULD BRING FLOWERS.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.382
AW, CRAP.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.484
HEY, MRS. FINNERTY.
HEY, BRAD.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.353
MR. FINNERTY,
MR. FINNERTY,
MR. FINNERTY.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.456
WHERE'S THE NEW
LITTLE FINNERTY?
IS SHE OUT YET?

15:23.490 --> 15:26.126
YES, BRAD, SHE'S OUT.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.360
WHERE'S LILY?

15:27.394 --> 15:28.261
RIGHT HERE, BRAD.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.597
OH, HEY, WHY'D YOU
BOLT OUT OF GRADUATION?

15:30.630 --> 15:34.034
ARE YOU KIDDING. I WAS
COMPLETELY HUMILIATED.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.268
I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY NOTICED.

15:35.302 --> 15:38.105
I WAS OUT THERE
IN MY CHEERLEADER OUTFIT,

15:38.138 --> 15:41.541
DANCING ALONE ON STAGE
TO NO MUSIC.

15:41.574 --> 15:42.609
WHAT DIDN'T THEY NOTICE?

15:42.642 --> 15:46.013
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT
THE NIPPLE THING.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.215
WHAT NIPPLE THING?

15:48.248 --> 15:51.184
TH--THE THING
NOBODY NOTICED.

15:51.218 --> 15:53.386
THAT'S GREAT!
THAT'S GREAT.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.687
NO, LILY, COME ON.
WHO CARES?

15:54.721 --> 15:56.156
WE'RE ALL GOING
INTO THE CITY TONIGHT.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.491
YOU KNOW,
I GOT US A LIMO.
REMEMBER?

15:58.525 --> 15:59.526
REALLY?

15:59.559 --> 16:01.594
YOU STILL WANT
TO BE SEEN WITH ME
AFTER ALL THAT?

16:01.628 --> 16:04.097
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I WANT TO BE SEEN
WITH YOU FOREVER.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.133
LILY, I LOVE YOU.

16:06.166 --> 16:10.603
BRAD, COME IN THE HALL
WITH ME. I WANT TO
TALK TO YOU.

16:10.637 --> 16:14.674
MARICRUZ, IS THAT
A DIAMOND RING?

16:14.707 --> 16:17.177
OH...YES.

16:17.210 --> 16:21.248
OH, MY GOD. WALT,
ARE YOU TWO ENGAGED?

16:21.281 --> 16:23.416
HA HA!

16:23.450 --> 16:25.185
ENGAGED?

16:25.218 --> 16:27.054
YES, WE'RE ENGAGED.

16:27.087 --> 16:27.787
WHAT?!

16:27.820 --> 16:28.955
HOW COULD YOU
NOT TELL US THAT?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.690
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO JUMP RIGHT
INTO "ENGAGEMENT"

16:30.723 --> 16:32.692
BEFORE YOU EVEN KNEW
I HAD A GIRLFRIEND.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.261
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU
NEVER TOLD US!

16:34.294 --> 16:35.528
SEE? THAT'S WHY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

16:35.562 --> 16:36.696
I KNEW YOU TWO WOULD
REACT LIKE THIS!

16:36.729 --> 16:40.133
COME ON, WE'RE REACTING
LIKE THIS...WE'RE JUST
SURPRISED.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.268
I MEAN, WE'RE HAPPY
FOR YOU, DAD.

16:41.301 --> 16:44.804
REALLY. IT'S JUST THIS
IS A LOT TO TAKE IN.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.240
YEAH, WELL, ALL RIGHT.
I--I--I'M SORRY.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.509
YOU'RE REALLY HAPPY
FOR ME?

16:49.542 --> 16:50.410
YEAH.

16:50.443 --> 16:53.280
YEAH, WE'RE HAPPY FOR
YOU. WE'RE THRILLED.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.181
WHERE ARE
YOU REGISTERED?

16:54.214 --> 16:56.083
AW, YOU BOYS DON'T
HAVE TO GET ME ANYTHING.

16:56.116 --> 17:00.320
COME ON, YOU DON'T WANT
A 62

17:01.221 --> 17:04.357
UNBELIEVABLE.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.425
WHAT IS IT?

17:05.458 --> 17:10.163
WELL, UH, THERE'S
BEEN SOMETHING
ON MY MIND LATELY.

17:10.197 --> 17:11.131
YEAH?

17:11.164 --> 17:14.767
UM, WELL, WE'VE KNOWN
EACH OTHER A LONG TIME.

17:14.801 --> 17:19.206
AND WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS,
WE'VE BEEN MORE
THAN FRIENDS.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.674
WE'VE BEEN MUCH MORE
THAN FRIENDS.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.310
I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

17:23.343 --> 17:27.147
WHAT I WAS PUTTING IN THE
"MORE THAN FRIENDS" CATEGORY.

17:27.180 --> 17:32.219
UM, THE THING IS,
WE'VE HAD OUR GOOD TIMES,

17:32.252 --> 17:33.820
AND WE'VE HAD
NOT-SO-GOOD TIMES,

17:33.853 --> 17:38.425
BUT YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
THERE, RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

17:38.691 --> 17:43.463
AND I REALIZE THAT I'M
REALLY GONNA MISS THAT.

17:43.496 --> 17:47.600
SO I DECIDED
TO GO TO SCSU.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.338
WELL, YEAH. WELL...

17:51.371 --> 17:52.172
NOT "WELL, YEAH."

17:52.205 --> 17:55.342
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
GOING TO RUTGERS.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.143
WHAT?

17:56.176 --> 17:58.411
HOW COULD YOU EVEN
CONSIDER RUTGERS?

17:58.445 --> 18:00.647
IT'S A COMPLICATED
DECISION, BRAD.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.549
BUT IT'S SO FAR
AWAY FROM ME.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.783
WELL,
I DIDN'T PICK IT!

18:03.816 --> 18:05.252
BUT YOU ALMOST DID!

18:05.285 --> 18:06.653
MAYBE I SHOULD!

18:06.686 --> 18:08.555
MAYBE YOU SHOULD!

18:10.323 --> 18:13.260
PLEASE DON'T.
OK.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.828
WHEN ARE THEY
BRINGING HER BACK?

18:15.862 --> 18:17.697
I WANT TO MEET
MY NEW NIECE.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.466
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING, ED.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.534
HOW MUCH DID THAT
WATCH COST?

18:21.568 --> 18:23.370
WHAT DOES IT
MATTER TO YOU?

18:23.403 --> 18:24.171
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.206
I MEAN, HOW MUCH?
MORE THAN MY CAR?

18:26.239 --> 18:29.342
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
YOUR CAR'S A PIECE
OF JUNK.

18:29.376 --> 18:30.610
YOU KNOW WHAT'S
NOT FAIR?

18:30.643 --> 18:32.545
WHAT'S NOT FAIR IS
THAT I BUSTED MY ASS
FOR 3 YEARS IN THAT BAR

18:32.579 --> 18:34.614
WHILE YOU CAME AND WENT
AS YOU PLEASED.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.284
AND JUST BECAUSE YOUR
CRAZY GIRLFRIEND
GOT LUCKY,

18:37.317 --> 18:38.518
BOUGHT IT
AND FLIPPED IT,

18:38.551 --> 18:39.519
NOW YOU'RE LIVING IT UP,

18:39.552 --> 18:41.388
AND I'M STILL BUSTING
MY ASS TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

18:41.421 --> 18:44.357
HEY, YOU GOT A BRAND NEW
BABY GIRL,

18:44.391 --> 18:46.226
YOU GOT A DAUGHTER GOING
OFF TO COLLEGE.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.395
HOW COULD YOU BE
TALKING ABOUT MONEY NOW?

18:48.428 --> 18:50.197
YEAH, I GOT A KID
GOING TO COLLEGE.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.398
HOW COULD I BE
THINKING ABOUT MONEY?

18:51.431 --> 18:53.400
HEY, LOOK, I'M YOUR
BROTHER, ALL RIGHT?

18:53.433 --> 18:56.236
I'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT THE PAST COUPLE
OF YEARS, TOO,

18:56.269 --> 18:57.470
AND I'M FINALLY DOING
GOOD, ALL RIGHT?

18:57.504 --> 19:00.840
IT WOULD MEAN A LOT
TO ME IF YOU COULD
JUST BE HAPPY FOR ME.

19:00.873 --> 19:04.544
OK? I MEAN, WHAT'S
IT GONNA TAKE?

19:06.713 --> 19:08.348
HOW ABOUT THE WATCH?

19:08.381 --> 19:10.383
YOU WANT THE WATCH?

19:10.417 --> 19:11.017
YEAH.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.252
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SAY SO?

19:12.285 --> 19:12.952
I WANT THE WATCH.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.254
YOU CAN
HAVE THE WATCH.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.255
BECAUSE YOU'RE MY BROTHER,

19:15.288 --> 19:18.925
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THE ROLEX
RIGHT OFF MY WRIST.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.428
YOU REALLY
GONNA KEEP THAT?

19:21.461 --> 19:22.962
YEAH.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.397
ENJOY IT.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.199
LOOK, IT'S
MY LITTLE SISTER!

19:26.233 --> 19:27.934
I FINALLY HAVE
A LITTLE SISTER!

19:27.967 --> 19:29.969
LET ME SEE
MY GRANDDAUGHTER!

19:30.002 --> 19:32.339
AW, SHE'S A BEAUTY!

19:32.372 --> 19:34.307
Claudia: HERE SHE IS.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.211
ROSE MAUREEN FINNERTY.

19:38.245 --> 19:41.381
ROSE, THIS IS YOUR
BIG BROTHER JIMMY,

19:41.414 --> 19:42.181
AND YOUR UNCLE EDDIE,

19:42.215 --> 19:45.485
AND YOUR GRANDPA WALT
AND MARICRUZ,

19:45.518 --> 19:48.455
YOUR...YOUR GRANDMOTHER,
I GUESS.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.657
AND YOUR
BIG SISTER LILY.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.391
AND BRAD...

19:51.424 --> 19:54.494
WHO I GUESS I'LL
BE LIVING WITH.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.763
NEAR! LIVING NEAR.

19:56.796 --> 19:57.864
ROSE.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.467
FROM MY FAVORITE
MOVIE, TITANIC.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.703
THAT'S, UH, THAT'S
NOT WHY WE NAMED
HER THAT, WALT.

20:03.736 --> 20:06.306
IT'S NOT FROM TITANIC?
ARE YOU SURE?

20:06.339 --> 20:08.741
IS IT TOO LATE
TO CHANGE HER NAME?

20:08.775 --> 20:09.809
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.744
WE SPENT A LOT OF
TIME TRYING TO
THINK UP HER NAME.

20:11.778 --> 20:14.381
ALL RIGHT, WE TALKED
ABOUT IT EVERY NIGHT
FOR MONTHS.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.649
AND THE ONE NAME
THAT WE FINALLY
CAME UP WITH

20:16.683 --> 20:18.785
THAT BOTH OF US LOVED
WAS ROSE.

20:18.818 --> 20:21.488
AND THAT'S HER NAME.
ROSE.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.655
WHAT ABOUT "GRACIE"?

20:22.689 --> 20:23.890
GRACIE.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.692
Walt: GRACIE'S PERFECT.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.560
OH, GOOD, WALT.

20:27.594 --> 20:30.263
NOW WE CAN USE
THE NAME ROSE.

20:30.297 --> 20:31.464
YEAH.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.700
WAIT A MINUTE. WHOA.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.468
Sean: HO HO, WHOA.

20:35.502 --> 20:36.703
ARE YOU PREGNANT?

20:36.736 --> 20:38.438
WELL, I WAS
GONNA TELL YOU.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.939
HOW THE HELL
COULD YOU--

20:39.972 --> 20:42.675
HONEY, HONEY,
WE HAVE A NEW BABY.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.377
YEAH, GRACIE.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.346
LOVE YOU, GRACIE.
AW!

20:48.047 --> 20:49.716
SHE'S SLEEPING.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.451
OH, COME ON.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.586
HI, LITTLE ONE.
