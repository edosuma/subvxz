These four alter egos
have come a long way to be here,

01:37.164 --> 01:39.031
but by the end of tonight,

01:39.033 --> 01:40.899
two alter egos
will be eliminated

01:40.968 --> 01:43.602
and reveal their
true identity to the judges,

01:43.637 --> 01:46.672
and two will secure
their spots in the finale.

01:46.707 --> 01:50.008
Judges, what are you hoping
to see tonight?

01:50.044 --> 01:54.113
Well, we've talked a lot
about all those elements
converging together,

01:54.115 --> 01:57.883
like, the technology
with the talent
with the stage presence,

01:57.918 --> 01:59.518
so I think what
I'm looking for tonight

01:59.553 --> 02:03.288
is who can combine
that humanity and that emotion

02:03.357 --> 02:05.591
with this ridiculous technology

02:05.626 --> 02:08.460
and give us
the best "alter ego" moment.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.929
I think that's what's
gonna set two of you apart

02:10.998 --> 02:12.865
and sends you on
into our finals, yeah.

02:15.836 --> 02:18.637
All right, guys,
we're gonna see you all perform
a little later tonight,

02:18.672 --> 02:20.506
but, seven, you're up first.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.374
Let's do this.

02:24.912 --> 02:28.514
To make it to the finals
means everything to me.

02:28.549 --> 02:31.750
By only four votes...

02:31.785 --> 02:33.152

more than this.

02:55.276 --> 02:58.443

03:05.186 --> 03:07.886
Everything is at stake,

03:07.955 --> 03:10.756
I'm really just trying

You really command attention

06:22.649 --> 06:26.251
and you're continuing
to put it all together in
a very cool way, so congrats.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.056
Now the alter ego on the diamond
at the end of the show

06:31.091 --> 06:33.425
will secure a spot
in the finale.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.861
But in this semi-final round,

06:35.896 --> 06:37.929
no one automatically
goes to the diamond.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.899
Each alter ego will need
at least three judge votes

06:40.934 --> 06:42.267
to make it up there.

06:42.302 --> 06:45.437
Judges, it's time for your vote.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.272
I just wanna say
at this point,

06:47.307 --> 06:49.341
I think you should
be feeling really good.

06:49.376 --> 06:50.542
This is, um-- oh, ha-ha.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.177
I didn't even
mean to do that, but, um...

06:53.781 --> 06:55.347
- Like, literally.
- Hold on one second.

06:55.349 --> 06:58.750
Can I just--
did I just hear grimes
make a pseudo-dad joke?

06:58.786 --> 07:01.520
- No, I didn't.
It was an accidental!
- Am I rubbing off on you?

07:01.588 --> 07:05.457
- It was accidental.
It was accidental.
- Some of the best ones are.

07:05.459 --> 07:08.427
Grimes: But to me,
seven, you're on the wave
of the future,

07:08.462 --> 07:11.430
and that was totally fire,
and I'm gonna say yes

07:11.465 --> 07:12.497
to you going on the diamond.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.235
Alanis?

07:17.271 --> 07:22.574
Seven, your voice
is so beautiful,

07:22.609 --> 07:25.110
and your energy is really
exciting to me, too.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.512
So, I'm gonna put seven up
on that diamond.

07:30.384 --> 07:33.385
Rocsi:
That is two votes for seven.

07:33.387 --> 07:37.222
All they need
is one more vote. Will?

07:37.257 --> 07:40.258
The marriage between
your alter ego

07:40.294 --> 07:42.527
and the classic song
that you sang

07:42.596 --> 07:45.096
but with the fresh twist
on it, I think was great.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.466
At the end of the day,
we're looking for a star.

07:47.501 --> 07:50.602
And I think you have what
it takes to go all the way,

07:50.637 --> 07:53.472
and that's the reason
why I want to put seven
on the diamond.

08:01.014 --> 08:04.349
That is the three votes
that seven needs

08:04.384 --> 08:05.984
to be up on that diamond.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.053
Congratulations.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.459
This semi-final
is far from over.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.928
When we come back, the rest
of our alter egos perform,

08:16.964 --> 08:19.297
and we'll find out
who's sticking around

08:19.299 --> 08:20.465
and who's heading home.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.300
More "alter ego"
coming your way after this.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.301
Yeah.

08:26.306 --> 08:29.007
Wow. Wowie.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.209
It's gonna get
really tough now.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.413
It's mariah and safara
till the end.

08:35.449 --> 08:36.581
I thought that was fire.

08:36.617 --> 08:39.184
No one's gonna slip up
in this environment.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.187
Jake:
<i>So many people would kill to be</i>
<i>in a position like this.</i>

08:42.222 --> 08:46.091
At this point, the competition
is between you two.

08:46.159 --> 08:49.127
Rocsi:
The studio audience
has voted for...

08:57.604 --> 09:01.239
Welcome back.
This is "alter ego."
I am rocsi diaz.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.708
Seven has been put
on the diamond by our judges,

09:03.744 --> 09:06.778
and I'm pretty sure
the next alter ego

09:06.780 --> 09:08.246
is ready to get on
the diamond as well.

09:08.282 --> 09:09.681
It's safara.

09:12.553 --> 09:15.086
It feels really great
to be in the semi-finals.

09:15.122 --> 09:18.256
I'm gonna choose safara
to go to the diamond.

09:18.258 --> 09:21.893
<i> When the judges put me through</i>
<i> in the head-to-head round...</i>

09:21.929 --> 09:23.295
Get it, baby.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.096
<i> ...That was really</i>
<i> a breakthrough moment for me.</i>

09:25.132 --> 09:26.565
Rocsi:
Go on up there, girl.

09:26.633 --> 09:29.467
Safara's confidence
is definitely rubbing off on me.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.105
I feel like the reason
I haven't been successful

09:34.141 --> 09:39.210
in my music career this far
is my insecurities
and my social anxiety.

09:39.279 --> 09:42.347
I kind of just feel like maybe
they won't want to talk to me

09:42.382 --> 09:43.949
or something because
of the way that I look.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.718
Yeah, I'm just nervous.

09:46.753 --> 09:50.088
Having safara
has definitely helped me grow

09:50.157 --> 09:53.925
and learn to love myself more
and to be more confident,

09:53.994 --> 09:57.629
and that represents exactly
the kind of artist I want to be.

09:57.664 --> 10:00.465
It's important to me
to make it to the finals

10:00.467 --> 10:05.870
because I want to get
what I've been working for
my entire life,

10:05.906 --> 10:06.938
a spot on that stage.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.941
It's mariah and safara

10:12.512 --> 10:13.545

10:14.815 --> 10:16.715
Are you ready

10:16.750 --> 10:19.417
I am. I am very ready
for tonight's performance.

10:19.486 --> 10:22.320
You know, uh...

10:24.191 --> 10:29.961
This performance
means a lot to me because I--

10:29.997 --> 10:33.898
I've been told
my whole life that--

10:33.967 --> 10:37.235
that I will never
make it as a singer

10:37.270 --> 10:39.037
because of the way
that I look.

10:39.072 --> 10:43.742
And I just wanna
prove everybody wrong,

10:43.810 --> 10:46.277
and I want to everybody
to know that--

10:46.279 --> 10:48.146

10:59.126 --> 11:03.294

that music has no shape.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.665
- Or music is not supposed
to have a shape.
- Yeah. Thank you.

11:08.602 --> 11:10.135

for us tonight?

11:10.203 --> 11:12.604

13:22.602 --> 13:25.804
- That was so awesome.
- Yeah!

13:25.839 --> 13:29.107
Really quick, keep it going
for the musicians backing up

13:29.109 --> 13:31.442
every single one
of our alter egos tonight.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.745
It's the incredible
adam blackstone

13:33.780 --> 13:35.713
and the alter ego band.

13:38.552 --> 13:42.187
Judges, what did you think
of safara's performance?

13:42.189 --> 13:43.822
I thought that was fire.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.426
Yeah, the power you have
in your voice

13:48.461 --> 13:50.862
when you were up there,
that's where you excel.

13:50.897 --> 13:52.997
I think we've seen
a lot of growth.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.433
I mean, you've really--
you've come so-fara.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.269
Oh.

14:01.541 --> 14:05.577
Judges, it's time
to decide if safara
is going on the diamond.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.946
She will need
at least three of your votes

14:07.981 --> 14:11.983
to knock seven off the diamond
and take their place.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.418
It's time for your vote.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.954
You know,
I think at this point,
this competition,

14:15.989 --> 14:18.623
you know, we're looking
at the whole artist's vibe.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.459
Like, who's song
am I waiting for next?

14:21.461 --> 14:23.428
I mean, this is,
like, really hard.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.464
Um, I'm going to keep seven
on the diamond

14:26.499 --> 14:29.734
only just because I think seven
has put a bit more time

14:29.803 --> 14:32.337
into crafting
their artistic persona.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.176
Will?

14:38.245 --> 14:40.745
For me, and how I was moved

14:40.780 --> 14:45.416
not only by the performance--

14:45.485 --> 14:47.285
and seven was great as well.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.253
You brought it tonight.

14:48.321 --> 14:51.789
But there's so much depth

14:51.825 --> 14:55.593
in what safara said
before you sang tonight

14:55.629 --> 14:59.264
that really opened up
my perspective of who safara is

14:59.299 --> 15:01.199
and what you're
truly fighting for.

15:01.234 --> 15:05.470
And I just felt like safara
was my sister tonight
that I wanna fight for.

15:08.275 --> 15:09.340
Yeah, so safara.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.776
Thank you, will!
Thank you!

15:11.811 --> 15:13.411
All right.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.581
So that is one vote for seven
to stay on the diamond

15:16.616 --> 15:18.783
and one vote for safara
to take their place.

15:18.818 --> 15:22.387
Safara, you need three votes
to get on the diamond.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.789
One more vote for seven
will keep them on the diamond

15:24.824 --> 15:26.824
and put you at risk
of going home tonight.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.259
Nick?

15:28.295 --> 15:30.428
I love the way safara
channeled all that emotion

15:30.463 --> 15:32.864
into a really,
really powerful performance.

15:32.866 --> 15:36.634
I really am fascinated
and entranced by seven,

15:36.670 --> 15:39.537
and there's manipulation
of their voice

15:39.606 --> 15:41.439
and the different flavors
and layers.

15:41.474 --> 15:46.377
So I am going to keep seven
up on the diamond.

15:51.084 --> 15:54.419
Safara, unfortunately you didn't
get the three votes needed

15:54.454 --> 15:55.954
to get up on that diamond,

15:55.989 --> 15:58.456
but nobody
is going home just yet.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.258
There's still so much show left.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.760
We've got two more performances,
and we'll find out

16:02.829 --> 16:05.296
which two alter egos
will be one step closer

16:05.298 --> 16:07.966
to becoming our
next generation superstar.

16:08.034 --> 16:10.101
More "alter ego" after this.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.209
-<i> Okay, here we go. </i>
- ( crowd chanting )

16:20.113 --> 16:21.779
<i> okay, here we go, gang.</i>

16:21.781 --> 16:23.815
<i> We're gonna meet</i>
<i> our next alter ego.</i>

16:31.057 --> 16:34.492
Welcome back.
This is "alter ego."
I'm rocsi diaz.

16:34.527 --> 16:38.896
Seven is on the diamond,
hoping to get that coveted
spot in the finale,

16:38.932 --> 16:41.499
but will they be able
to stay there?

16:41.534 --> 16:45.069
That's up to our next alter ego.
It's dipper scott.

16:51.911 --> 16:55.346
Coming out of the head-to-head,
I'm still feeling
a little bit shook up.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.782
♪ a little something
for the pain ♪

16:57.817 --> 16:59.917
I'm not gonna lie.
Dipper's my favorite.

16:59.953 --> 17:01.452
Hell yeah.

17:01.454 --> 17:05.123
Being onstage on a big platform,
it's all very strange to me.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.492
I can't understand why
you're not a superstar already.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.294
But I'm thankful
to be this far along.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.631
I'm excited
about the semi-finals.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.501
<i> The pressure's building.</i>
<i> There's $100,000 on the line.</i>

17:16.536 --> 17:20.171
<i> The mentorship from the judges</i>
<i> could change my life forever,</i>

17:20.240 --> 17:22.707
and just the future
of dipper scott
could be interesting.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.710
He could
technically perform remotely.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.312
<i> I could be here in los angeles</i>

17:28.348 --> 17:30.782
performing
for somebody in japan,

17:30.784 --> 17:33.584
<i> which would definitely</i>
<i> be helpful for me</i>

17:33.620 --> 17:36.421
<i> given the limitations</i>
<i> from my crohn's disease.</i>

17:36.456 --> 17:38.623
<i> ♪ a little something</i>
<i> for the pain ♪</i>

17:38.625 --> 17:40.825
to win the semi-final round,

17:40.827 --> 17:43.261
<i> I'm just gonna have</i>
<i> to bring my a-game</i>

17:43.296 --> 17:45.530
and do something
that no one else is doing.

17:49.803 --> 17:52.203
- Yeah!
- Alanis: Hi, dipper scott.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.505
How do you feel about being
this close to the finale?

17:54.541 --> 17:56.908
A little terrified, but I'm
pretty proud of myself actually.

17:56.943 --> 17:59.744
I've never done anything
like this. It's crazy.

18:01.347 --> 18:02.680
Well, I'm curious too.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.416
How do you feel like you've
raised your level this week?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.785
I brought something unique today

18:07.821 --> 18:10.855
because the meaning of this song
is a little more specific.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.790
Basically, when I was a child,

18:12.826 --> 18:16.094
I lost a big portion
of my childhood,

18:16.129 --> 18:17.462
and that's something
I'll never get back.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.297
So the message of the song

18:19.299 --> 18:21.566
is from my younger self
to me now

18:21.634 --> 18:24.635
telling me to let go
because he would probably

18:24.671 --> 18:25.770
want me to just be happier,

18:25.839 --> 18:28.139
and moving on
is the only way to do that.

18:28.174 --> 18:31.476
- Wow.
- That's awesome.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.112
What would it mean for you
to win the whole thing?

18:34.147 --> 18:35.546
It would mean a lot
to me actually.

18:35.582 --> 18:39.951
Um, I would pay off
a lot of medical bills

18:39.986 --> 18:42.386
with the winning money,
for sure.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.925
Are you ready
to perform for us?

18:47.994 --> 18:50.094
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.697
Nick: Let's do it.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.999
- I like the depth
he put on that.
- Mm-hmm.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.034
- He's very charismatic.
- He is.

Dipper!

21:01.861 --> 21:04.495
Yeah!

21:06.299 --> 21:12.069
Crowd: Dipper! Dipper!
Dipper! Dipper!

21:12.071 --> 21:13.938
Judges.

21:15.642 --> 21:19.310
Tell us what you thought about
dipper scott's performance.

21:19.345 --> 21:24.749
You have so many qualities
and ways of performing

21:24.784 --> 21:26.751
that just really
deeply resonate with me.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.253
So just hearing the idea
of your younger part singing

21:29.322 --> 21:32.056
to your older part and asking
to let go of something,

21:32.125 --> 21:35.559
the fact that there's even
that inner dialogue
going on inside you is--

21:35.595 --> 21:38.262
I would be in your audience,
basically.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.031
I'd love for you
to be in my audience.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.801
Judges, it's time
for your votes.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.804
Will seven stay,

21:46.839 --> 21:49.940
or will dipper scott
take their spot on the diamond

21:49.942 --> 21:52.910
and be one step closer
toward the finale?

21:52.945 --> 21:55.680
And remember, he needs three
of your votes to do so.

22:00.553 --> 22:03.421
I don't know anything about
dipper scott's backstory,

22:03.423 --> 22:06.657
but for some reason I feel
connected to dipper scott.

22:06.693 --> 22:07.892
I don't know what it is.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.093
I think that's the reason

22:09.128 --> 22:11.462
why people are gonna resonate
with dipper,

22:11.464 --> 22:14.198
so I would see dipper scott
on the diamond.

22:17.503 --> 22:18.469
Rocsi: Grimes?

22:18.504 --> 22:20.271
I mean, for me,

22:20.306 --> 22:22.873
I kinda feel like at this point
in the competition

22:22.909 --> 22:24.442
it's between you two.

22:24.477 --> 22:27.311
Um, this is really tough,

22:27.347 --> 22:30.014
and I hate making
these decisions,

22:30.083 --> 22:32.950
but next generation superstar,
to me, seven,

22:32.952 --> 22:34.118
you're on the wave
of the future,

22:34.153 --> 22:35.920
and I'm going to keep seven
on the diamond.

22:38.658 --> 22:41.225
That is one vote for seven,

22:41.260 --> 22:43.060
one vote for dipper.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.161
Alanis?

22:45.264 --> 22:47.431
I'm actually compelled
by both of you,

22:47.433 --> 22:50.634
so this is truly
a torturous moment for me.

22:50.670 --> 22:56.073
Crowd: Dipper! Dipper!

22:56.109 --> 23:00.344
Um, just because
I'm such a highly,
highly sensitive person,

23:00.413 --> 23:03.948
I'm guessing that, dipper,
you are as well,

23:03.983 --> 23:07.418
and I'm going to vote for you
to go up on that diamond.

23:14.026 --> 23:18.095
Rocsi: All right, nick,
dipper scott needs your vote

23:18.131 --> 23:20.030
to take seven's spot
on the diamond.

23:20.066 --> 23:23.667
These are two
of the most compelling,

23:23.669 --> 23:27.905
fascinating, interesting,
enjoyable alter egos

23:27.940 --> 23:30.107
that we've seen throughout
this entire competition.

23:30.109 --> 23:33.577
There's something
about dipper scott

23:33.646 --> 23:37.481
that I gotta vote to put him
up on the diamond.

23:38.684 --> 23:41.285
Those are
the three votes he needed.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.421
Dipper scott, congratulations.

23:43.456 --> 23:45.790
You are headed up
on that diamond.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.324
Go ahead. Wow.

23:51.197 --> 23:55.499
Seven, that means
that you may be leaving
the competition tonight.

23:55.568 --> 23:57.501
( jeering )

23:57.570 --> 24:00.438
we are one performance away
from learning

24:00.440 --> 24:03.574
which two alter egos will be
moving on to the finale

24:03.609 --> 24:05.743
and which two
will be leaving us tonight.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.012
More "alter ego" after this.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.620
<i> Orlando's performance</i>
<i> is up next.</i>

24:16.622 --> 24:19.490
<i> We need him on</i>
<i> the mo-cap stage asap.</i>

24:21.294 --> 24:22.293
<i> All right, here we go.</i>

24:29.502 --> 24:33.437
Welcome back.
This is "alter ego."
I'm rocsi diaz.

24:33.473 --> 24:36.106
Three incredible singers
have performed for us tonight.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.576
Dipper scott is on the diamond

24:38.644 --> 24:41.111
hoping to get that
coveted spot in the finale.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.581
But before we can find out
anyone's fate,

24:43.616 --> 24:45.583
there is one more alter ego
who is ready

24:45.618 --> 24:49.220
to step on this stage--
orlando deville.

24:52.391 --> 24:54.124
<i> The studio audience</i>
<i> has voted for...</i>

24:54.160 --> 24:56.760
( vocalizing )

24:56.796 --> 24:59.196
orlando deville to move on
to the semi-finals.

25:01.901 --> 25:05.135
Going into the semi-finals,
it's a different ballgame.

25:05.171 --> 25:08.739
<i> More than half</i>
<i> of the contestants have been</i>
<i> eliminated by this point,</i>

25:08.741 --> 25:11.809
<i>so the people that are sticking</i>
<i>around are really good.</i>

25:11.878 --> 25:14.712
No one's gonna slip up
in this environment.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.747
Where'd your hair go?

25:21.187 --> 25:23.687
Hey! So what were you thinking
for my performance?

25:23.756 --> 25:25.256
I just shared it with you.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.457
We're going
with the new york skyline.

25:26.492 --> 25:28.392
Chase:
Aw, that looks awesome.

25:28.427 --> 25:31.095
- Hey, what's up, guys?
- I just wanted to know,

25:31.130 --> 25:33.230
can I start with my leg up
on one of the buildings?

25:33.266 --> 25:34.565
Yeah, I think
that should be fine.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.867
Hey, gang.
What can I do for you?

25:36.869 --> 25:40.437
Any chance
orlando could be gold,
but a more orange gold?

25:40.473 --> 25:43.507
Something that's bold,
makes more of a statement
than we've had before?

25:43.543 --> 25:46.110
- I think we can do that.
- Thanks, everybody.
Appreciate you.

25:46.145 --> 25:49.280
- I like the suit.
- Oh, thank you very much.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.749
I'm glad you're digging
my tux-cheeto this evening.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.284
- Tux-cheeto.
- You like that?

25:53.319 --> 25:55.452
That's 24 karat velveeta
right there.

25:56.455 --> 25:58.222
Nick:
These are the semi-finals.

25:58.257 --> 26:00.791
How have you elevated
your performance?

26:00.793 --> 26:05.095
Well, first off,
I've been lucky enough to work
with some brilliant designers

26:05.131 --> 26:07.631
in this building
to bring my vision to life.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.533
Let's give it up for everybody
in this building, y'all.

26:12.505 --> 26:14.371
Orlando, you ready to show us
what you got tonight?

26:14.440 --> 26:17.308
- I'm ready to show you.
- All right, let's do it, man.

Yeah! All right.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.815
Crowd: Orlando! Orlando!

28:04.850 --> 28:09.920
Whoo! Orlando deville.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.856
- That was hot.
- Crowd: Orlando! Orlando!

28:12.858 --> 28:16.460
Judges, was the third time
a charm?

28:16.495 --> 28:19.029
Well, it sure was charming.
I'll give him that.

28:19.065 --> 28:22.700
It was really, really,
really strong.

28:22.702 --> 28:25.903
- Alanis?
- Yeah, I'm just excited.

28:25.971 --> 28:28.572
Your swagger was sort of
bubbling up at the beginning,

28:28.607 --> 28:31.308
and then now I feel like
your swagger's full blown.

28:31.343 --> 28:34.344
Full blown swagger. That sounds
like a medical condition.

28:37.183 --> 28:39.249
Well, it all comes down to this.

28:39.318 --> 28:42.453
The alter ego that the judges
put on the diamond right now

28:42.488 --> 28:44.788
will secure a spot
in the finale.

28:45.791 --> 28:48.726
So, will dipper stay,

28:48.794 --> 28:51.462
or will orlando deville
take his spot on the diamond

28:51.464 --> 28:53.630
and in the finale?

28:53.666 --> 28:57.334
Remember, he needs three
of your votes to do so.

28:57.403 --> 29:00.437
Judges, it's time
for your votes. Grimes?

29:00.473 --> 29:02.940
Like, when you first,
like, came here, I was like,
"oh, I don't know.

29:02.975 --> 29:05.409
I don't know about
this old school kind of thing."

29:05.444 --> 29:07.144
and then you've sort of been
slowly winning me over,

29:07.179 --> 29:10.013
and I feel like that
was your best performance.

29:10.049 --> 29:14.084
But at this point right now
in the competition,

29:14.153 --> 29:18.255
I'm looking more for
who am I attaching
to the most?

29:18.257 --> 29:21.592
And I feel like I'm already
an actual fan of dipper.

29:21.627 --> 29:25.462
So I'm gonna keep dipper
on the diamond.

29:25.498 --> 29:29.133
So that is one vote
for dipper scott
to stay on the diamond.

29:29.168 --> 29:32.269
Orlando deville,
you need three votes
to get on the diamond,

29:32.304 --> 29:34.438
and that is one vote
for dipper scott.

29:34.473 --> 29:37.107
One more vote for dipper
will keep him on the diamond

29:37.143 --> 29:40.110
and put you at risk
of going home tonight. Nick?

29:40.146 --> 29:42.780
Yeah, I thought,
orlando, your performance
was really strong tonight.

29:42.782 --> 29:45.582
I thought continued
to show growth on your part.

29:45.618 --> 29:46.784
When I think of
next generation superstar

29:46.786 --> 29:48.619
and I think of what
that means to me

29:48.621 --> 29:51.088
in terms of being
the entire package

29:51.157 --> 29:53.624
of this combination
of artistry

29:53.626 --> 29:55.926
and technology and talent,

29:55.995 --> 30:01.064
for me, there's just
some superstar quality

30:01.100 --> 30:04.134
about dipper scott.

30:04.203 --> 30:08.205
And so I will also vote
to keep dipper on that diamond.

30:09.909 --> 30:14.344
Dipper scott is officially
going to the finale.

30:16.615 --> 30:18.949
Orlando deville,
that means that you

30:18.951 --> 30:21.485
may be leaving
the competition tonight.

30:24.957 --> 30:28.959
Three alter egos remain
in the running for one spot
in the finale.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.261
Who will it be
and who will go home?

30:31.297 --> 30:34.832
We'll find out after the break.
More "alter ego" after this.

30:44.476 --> 30:47.544
<i> First elimination</i>
<i> of the night coming up.</i>

30:47.613 --> 30:49.913
<i> Everyone to their marks.</i>

30:49.949 --> 30:52.649
<i> Going to rocsi</i>
<i> in three, two, one.</i>

30:54.320 --> 30:56.286
This is "alter ego."
I'm rocsi diaz.

30:56.322 --> 30:59.122
Three alter egos remain
in the running

30:59.158 --> 31:01.625
for one spot in the finale.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.660
Let's welcome orlando deville,

31:03.662 --> 31:06.463
seven, and safara
back to the stage.

31:13.105 --> 31:17.541
I will now ask
the audience to vote
for their favorite alter ego.

31:17.576 --> 31:22.880
And the alter ego
that receives the fewest number
of audience votes

31:22.915 --> 31:25.148
will have to
say goodbye tonight.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.820
I'm gonna have ptsd
from this show.

31:35.027 --> 31:36.560
I can now confirm

31:36.595 --> 31:41.231
that the alter ego who received
the fewest audience votes,

31:41.233 --> 31:45.068
becoming the first alter ego
to leave us tonight is...

32:01.520 --> 32:02.786
Safara.

32:02.821 --> 32:04.788
What?

32:04.823 --> 32:06.590
What?

32:06.625 --> 32:09.459
( crowd gasping, groaning )

32:09.461 --> 32:10.928
- man: Don't let her go!
- Woman: Safara!

32:10.996 --> 32:14.231
- What? What?
- Rocsi: Safara,
this is the end

32:14.266 --> 32:18.068
of your journey with us here
on "alter ego."

32:18.070 --> 32:22.039
orlando deville and seven,
you are safe for now.

32:22.074 --> 32:24.441
The judges will decide your fate
later tonight.

32:26.912 --> 32:32.149
Safara, it's been such
a pleasure having you here,

32:32.184 --> 32:35.786
and we'd love if you would
perform for us one last time

32:35.821 --> 32:39.356
and reveal your true identity
to the judges.

32:39.391 --> 32:40.924
All righty, let's do it.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.094
( laughs, sniffles )

32:44.163 --> 32:46.897
make it loud one last time
for safara.

32:49.435 --> 32:52.436
Grimes: I feel like that's
the most we've seen from her.

32:52.438 --> 32:54.237
She's been very shy
in the talking.

32:54.273 --> 32:56.740
Yeah, she was shy before.

32:56.809 --> 32:59.276
Alanis: Any nerves
that may have been there
seem to have disappeared.

32:59.278 --> 33:00.911
Will:
Definitely no nerves there.

aka mariah.

34:35.908 --> 34:36.907
Ow!

34:39.711 --> 34:43.180
What do you learn from safara?

34:43.215 --> 34:46.416
I learned to be
confident in myself

34:46.485 --> 34:49.119
and to love myself--

34:49.154 --> 34:52.622
man, no matter what
anybody has said about me.

34:52.658 --> 34:53.657
( sobs )

34:56.462 --> 34:58.261
alanis?

34:58.297 --> 35:01.031
- I'm just so excited
for you, yeah.
- Aw, thank you.

35:01.066 --> 35:04.267
I just get really excited,
because when those
voices in our head

35:04.303 --> 35:07.571
that sabotage us
and hold us back step aside,

35:07.639 --> 35:12.576
then the real mariah emerges,
and I am so excited for her.

35:12.611 --> 35:15.579
And that voice inside your head,
what I would say to it is,

35:15.614 --> 35:18.415
"thanks for trying
to help her and protect her,
but it's not helping."

35:18.450 --> 35:22.085
yeah. Thank you.
Yeah.

35:22.154 --> 35:24.454
- You have a beautiful voice.
- Thank you.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.790
Will: A beautiful aura.
Like, when I said like,

35:26.825 --> 35:29.092
"for some reason,
you make me feel like

35:29.128 --> 35:31.928
my sister that I wanna protect,"
I really meant that.

35:31.997 --> 35:35.298
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
Thank you so much.

35:36.735 --> 35:39.069
Honestly, like,
yeah, you've been amazing,

35:39.104 --> 35:41.438
and I think you should be
really proud that you made it
this far in the show.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.740
- Thank you.
- Everyone got to hear you
sing and stuff, so...

35:43.775 --> 35:48.545
Thank you. I am. I am.
And I got confidence back.
I got my happiness back.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.581
And that's inval--
I mean, there's no money

35:51.617 --> 35:53.016
in the world that can buy that.

35:53.085 --> 35:55.752
Couldn't have said it better.
Absolutely true.

35:55.787 --> 35:58.421
- Thank you so much
for being here.
- Thank you.

35:58.457 --> 36:01.625
Orlando deville and seven
remain in the competition.

36:01.660 --> 36:05.462
We only have room for one more
alter ego in the finale.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.631
Who will it be,
and who will go home?

36:07.666 --> 36:10.901
We'll find out after the break.
More "alter ego" after this.

36:10.936 --> 36:14.938
<i> Last semi-final</i>
<i> elimination coming up.</i>
<i> Places everyone.</i>

36:19.144 --> 36:21.378
<i> Here we go.</i>
<i> Coming out of commercial.</i>
<i> Here we go.</i>

36:21.413 --> 36:25.048
- ( trilling )
-<i> here we go in five seconds.</i>

36:25.117 --> 36:26.149
<i> Big applause.</i>

36:32.558 --> 36:34.090
Welcome back to "alter ego."

36:34.159 --> 36:35.892
it's the end of our semi-final,

36:35.928 --> 36:39.863
and now only two alter egos
are left standing,

36:39.898 --> 36:42.699
orlando deville and seven.

36:42.734 --> 36:45.635
We're about to find out
which alter ego will be taking

36:45.704 --> 36:48.238
the very last spot
in the finale.

36:48.273 --> 36:51.074
Judges, it's time
for your votes.

36:51.109 --> 36:54.644
The alter ego
who gets the most votes
will head to the finale.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.748
- Seven! Seven!
- Orlando! Orlando!

36:58.784 --> 37:01.251
Nick, which one
of these alter egos

37:01.286 --> 37:04.054
is the next generation
superstar?

37:04.056 --> 37:06.790
The tricky part for me in this

37:06.825 --> 37:09.626
is that while both of you
did such an outstanding job,

37:09.661 --> 37:12.929
you're also both
very different performers.

37:12.965 --> 37:15.098
But I keep coming back
to the phrase you used--

37:15.100 --> 37:18.268
next generation superstar.

37:18.303 --> 37:21.438
And when I think about
all the ingredients
that we've talked about

37:21.473 --> 37:24.174
that make up that
next generation superstar,

37:24.209 --> 37:26.409
I just feel like--

37:26.478 --> 37:30.113
I feel like seven
is more poised

37:30.148 --> 37:31.715
to step into that role.

37:31.750 --> 37:36.786
So, I vote to send seven
onto the finals.

37:36.822 --> 37:40.590
- Rocsi: Alanis?
- Orlando, you really
brought it, and...

37:45.864 --> 37:49.899
Yeah, it's style of music
that I don't always listen to,
but I always appreciate,

37:49.935 --> 37:51.601
and I just feel
like you stepped into it

37:51.637 --> 37:55.272
and have zero ambivalence
about being that performer.

37:55.274 --> 37:57.274
And, seven, I still feel

37:57.309 --> 37:58.875
very compelled by
your performance

37:58.910 --> 38:01.578
and by who you are
as an alter ego,

38:01.580 --> 38:02.579
and I wanna know more.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.247
And that counts
for a lot for me,

38:04.283 --> 38:07.217
so I'm going to choose seven.

38:09.221 --> 38:13.456
That is two votes for seven
to move on to the finale.

38:13.458 --> 38:16.526
They only need one more vote.

38:16.561 --> 38:18.361
Will?

38:18.430 --> 38:20.897
Orlando, when somebody
has the ability

38:20.932 --> 38:25.568
to transfix audiences to come,
to go on tour,

38:25.637 --> 38:29.272
inspire people to want
to buy merchandise,
that's magic.

38:29.308 --> 38:30.740
And you have that.

38:30.776 --> 38:35.111
But I have to go with what makes
my heart feel a certain way.

38:35.147 --> 38:37.013
The complete package was there,

38:37.049 --> 38:40.617
and so I'm gonna vote
to send seven to the finale.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.090
That is three votes for seven.

38:47.159 --> 38:49.626
Seven, you will be
moving on to the finale.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.633
We will see you there.
Congrats.

38:56.668 --> 39:00.904
Ugh! Orlando deville,
I am so sorry.

39:00.939 --> 39:05.508
But we would love for you
to perform one last time

39:05.544 --> 39:07.777
and reveal your true identity

39:07.779 --> 39:10.013
by coming on out here
and meeting the judges.

39:10.048 --> 39:12.949
- How about that?
- Sounds like a plan.
Let's make it happen.

39:12.984 --> 39:16.886
All right. Let's hear it
for orlando deville.

39:20.425 --> 39:23.460
Yeah!

39:23.495 --> 39:25.862
So, I'm just really curious
what orlando deville looks like.

39:27.299 --> 39:29.265
I have no clue.

39:40.912 --> 39:44.948

40:51.850 --> 40:53.917
- Man, chase.
- Good to meet you, chase.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.318
Good to meet you too, mr. Nick.

40:55.353 --> 40:57.754
Look, it was obvious
as orlando deville.

40:57.789 --> 41:02.025
It was just obvious as chase
that you just love to entertain.

41:02.027 --> 41:06.095
Like, you have a gift.
- That is the truth.An?

41:06.131 --> 41:09.399
Chase, what originally
brought you to "alter ego?"

41:09.468 --> 41:11.601
well, for my whole my life
I've been told

41:11.636 --> 41:13.736
I had this voice
made for the stage

41:13.805 --> 41:16.706
but a face made for it, and--

41:16.708 --> 41:17.841
oh, my god.

41:17.876 --> 41:21.144
It's funny 'cause it's true.

41:22.514 --> 41:24.614
He's a hottie.
I don't know what
anybody's talking about.

41:27.285 --> 41:30.453
- I always loved the nerds.
I'm always team nerd.
- Chase: No, I'll take it.

41:30.522 --> 41:33.623
You and me,
we speak binary code.
I get it.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.658
- Yeah.
- Yep.

41:35.727 --> 41:38.428
You know that saying
don't judge a book
by its cover?

41:38.430 --> 41:40.530
You put a whole new
definition to that.

41:40.599 --> 41:42.765
You're not supposed
to judge the bowl

41:42.801 --> 41:44.434
because you don't which bowl
got the soul,

41:44.436 --> 41:46.069
- and you got a lot
of soul, bro.
- That's right.

41:46.104 --> 41:48.104
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

41:50.642 --> 41:52.075
Is there anything
that you would like to say

41:52.110 --> 41:53.443
to orlando deville
before you go?

41:53.478 --> 41:55.445
Mr. Deville,

41:55.480 --> 41:58.281
- I will take it from here.
- Oh!

41:59.484 --> 42:00.783
- I like that!
- Hell yeah.

42:00.819 --> 42:03.419
- I like that a lot.
- Chase!

42:03.421 --> 42:07.023
Everyone, big round
of applause for chase,
one last time.

42:08.293 --> 42:10.460

42:10.462 --> 42:12.629
It never gets any easier
saying goodbye

42:12.664 --> 42:14.864

talented alter egos.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.399
Make sure you tune in

42:16.434 --> 42:19.102
where we crown
the winner of "alter ego."

42:20.605 --> 42:22.071
good night.

42:23.108 --> 42:24.507
I did not see that coming.
