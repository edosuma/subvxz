WEBVTT

00:39.600 --> 00:43.100
<i>Yeah</i>

00:43.300 --> 00:46.200
<i>Yes, I've never been to Graceland</i>

00:46.300 --> 00:48.600
<i>Never took that trip</i>

00:53.600 --> 00:58.500
<i>No, I never been to Vegas
'cept once on a plane</i>

00:58.700 --> 01:01.400
<i>I never left the airport</i>

01:01.600 --> 01:04.400
<i>Ain't goin' back again</i>

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
<i>Yes, I've never been to Graceland</i>

01:11.300 --> 01:14.500
In Jailhouse Rock, he was
everything rockabilly's about.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.400
Nah, nah. I mean, he is rockabilly.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.000
Mean, surly, nasty, rude.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.600
In that movie, he couldn't give a fuck
about nothin'. It's, like, rockin' and rollin',

01:24.800 --> 01:28.100
livin' fast, dying young and
leaving a good-lookin' corpse.

01:28.400 --> 01:32.900
Some people said he's crazy

01:33.100 --> 01:36.700
I watched that hillbilly, and
I would wanna be him so bad.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.600
Elvis looked good.

01:40.800 --> 01:45.500
I mean, I ain't no fag, but Elvis was
prettier than most women, you know?

01:45.700 --> 01:47.800
Most women.

01:50.100 --> 01:53.200
You know, I always said
if I had to fuck a guy--

01:53.500 --> 01:57.000
you know, I mean, had to--
if my life depended on it--

01:57.200 --> 02:00.400
I'd fuck Elvis.

02:00.600 --> 02:04.300
I'd fuck Elvis.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.900
- Really?
- Well, when he was alive. Not now.

02:08.199 --> 02:13.800
Well, I don't blame you.
So we'd, uh, we'd both fuck Elvis.

02:14.100 --> 02:18.800
It's nice to meet people with
common interests, ain't it? Yeah.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.300
Well, enough about the King.
How 'bout-- How 'bout you?

02:24.600 --> 02:28.700
How 'bout me, what?

02:28.900 --> 02:31.800
How 'bout you go to the
movies with me tonight?

02:33.400 --> 02:37.600
- What are we gonna see?
- A Sonny Chiba triple feature.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.900
The Street Fighter, Return of the
Street Fighter and Sister Street Fighter.

02:42.200 --> 02:46.700
- Who's Sonny Chiba?
- Who is Sonny Chiba?

02:47.000 --> 02:51.900
He is, bar none, the finest actor
working in martial arts movies today.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.400
You wanna take me to a Kung Fu movie?

02:57.500 --> 03:00.200
3 Kung Fu movies.

03:04.200 --> 03:08.800
I don't think so. Not really my cup of tea.

03:09.100 --> 03:12.000
Ah, all right.

04:51.500 --> 04:55.900
<i>I had to come all the way from the highway
and byways of Tallahassee, Florida...</i>

04:56.200 --> 05:00.100
<i>to Motor City, Detroit,
to find my true love.</i>

05:00.300 --> 05:03.300
<i>If you gave me a million years to ponder,</i>

05:03.600 --> 05:08.100
<i>I would never have guessed that true
romance and Detroit would ever go together.</i>

05:08.400 --> 05:13.100
<i>And to this day, the events that
followed all seem like a distant dream.</i>

05:13.400 --> 05:19.000
<i>But the dream was real and was
to change our lives forever.</i>

05:22.300 --> 05:25.800
<i>I kept asking Clarence why our
world seemed to be collapsing...</i>

05:26.000 --> 05:29.600
<i>and everything seemed
so shitty, and he'd say,</i>

05:29.800 --> 05:32.200
<i>"That's the way it goes.</i>

05:32.500 --> 05:36.400
<i>But don't forget: It
goes the other way too."</i>

05:36.600 --> 05:42.200
<i>That's the way romance is.
Usually, that's the way it goes.</i>

05:42.500 --> 05:47.300
<i>But every once in a while,
it goes the other way too.</i>

05:53.600 --> 05:56.600
<i>My heart beats, and there's time.</i>

06:14.200 --> 06:19.300
Don't move, Tojo. You'll be unconscious
soon through lack of oxygen.

06:19.500 --> 06:24.500
<i>- It's an ancient technique.
- An oxygen--</i>

06:29.800 --> 06:33.200
Oh, look what happened.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.700
- That's okay. I'm fine.
- You okay?

06:35.900 --> 06:39.300
Oh, Jesus. I'm the clumsiest
person in the world.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.000
It's all right. Accidents happen.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.500
What a wonderful philosophy.
Thanks for being a sweetheart,

06:45.800 --> 06:48.000
'cause you could've been a real dick.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.100
<i>- Come on. Ready?
- Yes.</i>

06:51.300 --> 06:54.400
<i>Larry, where are we going?</i>

07:05.300 --> 07:07.900
<i>Look, we don't know what's
going to be coming next.</i>

07:08.100 --> 07:11.000
<i>- You mean, you're scared?
- Aren't you?</i>

07:11.100 --> 07:13.000
<i>Hey, laundromat clothes!</i>

07:13.200 --> 07:17.000
- Mind if I smoke?
- No, no.

07:17.100 --> 07:19.900
Listen, do you mind filling
me in on what I missed?

07:21.200 --> 07:23.500
No, no. Um--

07:25.300 --> 07:28.800
Let's see. Uh, that guy up there,
that's Sonny Chiba.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.200
- The Oriental?
- Yeah. The one in black.

07:33.500 --> 07:38.300
- Want a Goober?
- Uh, no-- Yeah.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.100
In the beginning of the movie,
he was hired to get this guy--

07:41.300 --> 07:46.200
- You've got popcorn all over you.
- Thanks. That's all right.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.900
- Is he supposed to be a good guy?
- Uh, well,

07:51.100 --> 07:53.800
he ain't so much a good guy as
he is just a bad motherfucker.

07:54.100 --> 07:57.900
He gets paid by people
to fuck guys up, you know?

08:02.800 --> 08:05.000
You came to see 3 Kung Fu movies?

08:05.100 --> 08:08.100
- Sure. Why not?
- Nothin', nothin'.

08:08.300 --> 08:11.300
It's just you're a girl after
my own heart, that's all.

08:11.500 --> 08:15.400
- Do you know what time it is?
- It's about 12:00.

08:15.600 --> 08:19.000
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?

08:19.300 --> 08:22.200
No, not particularly. How come?

08:22.400 --> 08:27.200
It's just after I see a movie, I like to
go get a piece of pie and talk about it.

08:27.500 --> 08:31.900
It's sort of a little tradition I have. Do you
like to get pie after you see a good movie?

08:33.900 --> 08:37.400
Yeah, I love to get pie after a movie.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.900
Would like to go get some pie with me?

08:41.100 --> 08:43.400
Yeah, I'd love some pie.

08:43.799 --> 08:47.800
<i>In my life</i>

08:48.000 --> 08:50.700
In that movie, he didn't
give a fuck about nothin'...

08:50.900 --> 08:55.400
except rock 'n' roll, livin' fast, dyin'
young and leavin' a good-lookin' corpse.

08:55.700 --> 08:59.200
Enough about the King. How about you?

08:59.400 --> 09:03.700
- How about me, what?
- Tell me-- Tell me about yourself.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.800
What do you wanna know?

09:07.000 --> 09:11.500
Well, for starters, uh, what do you do,
where are you from, what's your favorite color,

09:11.800 --> 09:15.500
who's your favorite movie star,
what kind of music do you like,

09:15.700 --> 09:18.400
what are your turn-ons, your turnoffs?

09:18.600 --> 09:21.500
I guess the big question
is do you have a fella?

09:21.800 --> 09:25.100
Okay. Ask me again, one by one.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.700
- What do you do?
- I don't remember.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.800
- Where are you from?
- I don't know.

09:29.900 --> 09:34.400
- What's your favorite color?
- I don't know. Black?

09:34.700 --> 09:37.500
- Who's your favorite movie star?
- Burt Reynolds.

09:37.700 --> 09:41.500
- You want a bite of my pie?
- Yes, I would. A little one.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.800
All right. Oop. You all right?

09:45.000 --> 09:48.500
- It's good. You like it?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

09:48.800 --> 09:53.400
- What kind of music you like?
- Phil Spector. Girl group stuff like "He's a Rebel."

09:53.700 --> 09:56.200
What are your turn-ons?

09:56.400 --> 10:01.300
Mm, Mickey Rourke. A man who can appreciate
the finer things in life, like sugar.

10:02.900 --> 10:05.700
Elvis's voice, Kung Fu, pot.

10:06.100 --> 10:09.400
- Turnoffs?
- Turnoffs.

10:09.600 --> 10:13.100
- Mm-hmm.
- Persians.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.500
Do you, uh, have a fella?

10:18.700 --> 10:21.700
Ask me that one a little bit later.

10:21.900 --> 10:26.800
In a theater full of empty
seats, why did you sit by me?

10:28.300 --> 10:32.300
'Cause you looked like a nice guy.

10:32.600 --> 10:36.000
So I had to dump my popcorn all over you.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.300
I'll get the check. Where to next?

10:41.800 --> 10:45.100
- Can I peek?
- Don't peek. Keep your eyes shut.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.200
All right? All right.
I'm turnin' the lights on.

10:48.300 --> 10:51.100
Okay. Open 'em.

10:51.300 --> 10:56.400
Oh, wow! Wow, what a swell place to work!

10:56.700 --> 11:01.600
Yeah, it's pretty cool. I got the keys,
so I just come in, read comics, play music.

11:01.900 --> 11:05.600
- You worked here a long time?
- Almost 4 years.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.800
That's a long time.

11:08.700 --> 11:12.000
I know, but it's not so bad. I mean,
I'm pretty friendly with most of the customers,

11:12.200 --> 11:15.500
so I just hang out, you know,
bullshit, read comic books.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.100
You get paid a lot?

11:17.200 --> 11:21.400
Uh, no. That's where the trouble
comes into paradise. But--

11:21.800 --> 11:26.200
the boss, he's a pretty nice guy.
He lets you borrow money from time to time.

11:27.500 --> 11:30.400
<i>To be lonely</i>

11:30.800 --> 11:33.000
You wanna see what Spider-Man
number 1 looks like?

11:34.400 --> 11:35.300
You bet.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.400
Just great stories, great
characters, beautiful artwork.

11:39.600 --> 11:43.100
See, in this one here, Nick,
he's gotten this ring for his sweetheart,

11:43.400 --> 11:46.200
and he wears it around his neck on a chain.

11:46.400 --> 11:50.900
And later on in the story, he gets
in this fight with this Nazi bastard.

11:51.100 --> 11:54.300
And the Kraut, he grabs ahold of
the chain. The ring goes overboard.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.900
<i>But I just don't know</i>

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Nick, he dives into the ocean to get it.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.000
Isn't that cool?

12:02.100 --> 12:05.100
<i>- Haven't you heard
- Haven't you heard</i>

12:05.400 --> 12:08.200
<i>Guess we're just 2 wounded birds</i>

12:09.700 --> 12:13.500
<i>Now we're both here</i>

12:13.800 --> 12:16.600
<i>And we're alone</i>

12:21.700 --> 12:25.700
<i>We still don't know</i>

12:25.900 --> 12:29.900
<i>What it takes Oh, girl</i>

12:34.100 --> 12:38.300
<i>We wanna feel love</i>

12:40.100 --> 12:43.800
<i>We're just so scared</i>

12:45.100 --> 12:48.100
<i>I know we've got nothing</i>

12:48.200 --> 12:51.200
<i>- But haven't you heard
- Haven't you heard</i>

12:51.400 --> 12:55.900
<i>I guess we're just 2 wounded birds</i>

12:59.800 --> 13:03.300
<i>Oh, we wanna say it</i>

13:03.500 --> 13:06.700
<i>- And can't find the words
- Can't find the words</i>

13:06.900 --> 13:10.100
<i>I guess we're just 2 wounded birds</i>

13:46.500 --> 13:49.800
What is it? Are you cryin'?
What'd I do? Did I do somethin'?

13:49.900 --> 13:53.100
- You didn't do nothin'.
- What is it?

13:55.200 --> 13:58.100
I have something I gotta tell you.

14:00.500 --> 14:04.000
I didn't just happen to be at that
theater. I was paid to be there.

14:06.100 --> 14:09.400
You were paid to be there? Are you a
theater checker? You get paid to check up...

14:09.700 --> 14:12.400
on the box office girls, make sure
they're not ripping the place off?

14:12.600 --> 14:15.500
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.

14:17.400 --> 14:21.400
- You're a whore?
- No, I'm a call girl, and there's a difference.

14:24.800 --> 14:30.300
Here it goes. You know the place you
took me last night, the place you work?

14:30.600 --> 14:33.200
- Heroes for Sale?
- You got a boss, right?

14:33.300 --> 14:35.500
- Yeah.
- What's his name?

14:35.700 --> 14:39.400
- Lance.
- That's him. He called the place where I work.

14:39.700 --> 14:42.500
He ordered a girl for you.
He said he wanted you to get laid,

14:42.600 --> 14:46.100
seein' you didn't get out much
and it was your birthday and all.

14:48.300 --> 14:51.900
He wanted me to act like I just showed up. How
did he know you were gonna be at that theater?

14:52.200 --> 14:55.000
Uh, well, I go to the movies
every year on my birthday.

14:55.200 --> 14:59.200
In fact, he called me up this week to find
out what my birthday movie was gonna be.

14:59.400 --> 15:03.400
- You're not mad?
- No, man.

15:03.700 --> 15:07.800
I can't tell you-- That's one of
the best times I ever had. It was.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.800
I knew something must be rotten in Denmark.
There was no way you could like me that much.

15:12.100 --> 15:16.700
I can't tell you how relieved I was when you
took off your dress, you didn't have a dick.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.500
Stop being so fucking calm about
all this! Go look in your house!

15:20.800 --> 15:24.100
There's a note on your TV. It says "Dear
Clarence," 'cause I couldn't write any more.

15:24.200 --> 15:28.500
So I just said, "Alabama, come
clean and just tell him what's what.

15:28.800 --> 15:33.400
And if he tells you to go back to Drexl and
fuck yourself, then go back and fuck yourself."

15:33.700 --> 15:37.700
- Drexl? What's a Drexl?
- Please shut up! I'm trying to come clean, okay?

15:38.000 --> 15:41.700
I've been a call girl for exactly 4 days,
and you're my 3rd customer.

15:41.900 --> 15:45.100
I want you to know that
I am not damaged goods.

15:45.400 --> 15:49.900
I'm not what they call in Florida
"white trash." I'm a really good person.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.300
And when it comes to relationships,

15:53.500 --> 15:56.300
I'm 100%--

15:56.500 --> 16:00.700
I'm 100% monogamous.

16:00.900 --> 16:04.600
- You stay with one guy?
- Exactly.

16:04.900 --> 16:09.400
If I'm with you, then I'm with
you, and I don't want anybody else.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.400
Now, I gotta tell you something
else. When you said last night...

16:16.600 --> 16:19.500
was one of the best times you
ever had, did you mean physically?

16:19.600 --> 16:23.100
Well, yeah. Yeah, but I'm
talking about the whole night.

16:23.300 --> 16:27.000
I mean, I never had as much fun with a
girl as I had with you in my whole life.

16:27.300 --> 16:31.400
It's true. You like Elvis. You like Janis.

16:31.700 --> 16:35.300
You like Kung Fu movies. You
like The Partridge Family.

16:35.500 --> 16:39.400
- Star Trek.
- Actually, I don't like The Partridge Family.

16:39.700 --> 16:44.100
That was part of the act.

16:44.300 --> 16:49.400
Clarence-- and I feel
really goofy saying this...

16:49.600 --> 16:52.800
after only knowing you one night...

16:53.000 --> 16:56.200
and me being a call girl and all--

16:56.400 --> 16:59.300
but I think I love you.

17:06.099 --> 17:09.099
Wait a second.

17:09.200 --> 17:13.800
Look, I've been tryin' to keep
this whole thing in perspective.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.400
You just said you love me. Now, if I say I
love you and just throw caution to the wind...

17:17.599 --> 17:20.900
and let the chips fall where they may,
and you're lyin' to me, I'm gonna fuckin' die.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
I'm not lyin' to you, and I
swear from this moment forth,

17:26.300 --> 17:29.500
I'll never lie to you again.

17:40.100 --> 17:44.800
- Whoo-hoo! Well, hello, Mrs.Worley.
- How do you do, Mr.Worley?

17:45.000 --> 17:48.900
- Top of the mornin' to ya, Mrs.Worley.
- Bottom of the ninth, Mr.Worley.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.800
- By the way, have you seen your lovely little wife today?
- Are you speaking...

17:52.000 --> 17:54.800
of my beautiful, charming,
sexy wife, Mrs. Alabama Worley?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.600
- Why, are there any others, Mr.Worley?
- No. None for me. No.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.600
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

18:05.900 --> 18:09.000
- It's a nice day for a white wedding
- Excuse me.

18:09.300 --> 18:12.300
Do you think you could turn
down the heat just a teeny bit?

18:12.400 --> 18:16.700
It's a nice day to start again

18:16.900 --> 18:19.500
'Bama, I gotta ask you a
question. Who and what is a Drexl?

18:22.500 --> 18:26.200
- He was my pimp.
- You had a pimp?

18:27.700 --> 18:32.500
- I was a call girl. Call girls have pimps.
- Was he black?

18:32.800 --> 18:37.000
He thinks he is. He said his mama was
an Apache, but I suspect he's lyin'.

18:37.300 --> 18:41.600
- Is he nice?
- I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice,

18:41.900 --> 18:44.300
but he treated me pretty decent.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.400
I was only there for 4 days. He got
a little bit rough the other day.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.400
- What do you mean? With you?
- No. My friend Arlene.

18:50.700 --> 18:55.500
- What did he do to Arlene?
- Slapped her around a little bit, kicked her.

18:55.800 --> 19:00.000
- It was pretty scary.
- This motherfucker sounds beautiful.

19:00.300 --> 19:04.800
What'd you do to end up with
a son of a bitch like that?

19:08.300 --> 19:12.500
- What you motherfuckers talkin' about?
- Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.

19:12.800 --> 19:16.700
Drexl, shit. Any nigga say he don't
eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.

19:16.900 --> 19:21.000
- I heard that.
- Hold on a second, Big "D." You sayin' you eat pussy?

19:21.200 --> 19:24.200
Yeah, motherfucker. I eat everything.
I eat pussy. I eat the butt.

19:24.500 --> 19:27.600
- I eat every motherfuckin' thing.
- If I ever did eat some pussy--

19:27.800 --> 19:31.600
I would never eat any pussy, right?
But if I did eat some pussy,

19:31.900 --> 19:34.600
I sure as hell wouldn't tell
no-goddamn-body about it.

19:34.800 --> 19:38.100
- I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker, man.
- Nigga, you smoke enough Sherm,

19:38.200 --> 19:41.100
your dumb ass'll do a lot
of motherfuckin' things.

19:41.200 --> 19:44.700
You'd be up in there suckin' niggas' dicks!

19:45.900 --> 19:48.800
- Oh.
- Yo, man! Fuck you guys!

19:49.100 --> 19:53.300
- You guys is fucked up.
- Yo, yo, why you trippin'? We just fuckin' with you.

19:53.500 --> 19:58.100
In fact, I'm gonna show you what
I mean with a little demonstration.

19:58.400 --> 20:01.400
Toss me the burner.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.400
All right. Peep this.

20:06.200 --> 20:09.600
Pretend it's that fine centerfold bitch.

20:09.700 --> 20:14.000
Know what I'm sayin'? And you're you.

20:24.300 --> 20:28.600
You say it ain't tough I got
ya I can't get enough, Get it

20:28.900 --> 20:33.000
Get it, get it

20:33.300 --> 20:36.100
Get it

20:57.500 --> 21:01.200
- Honey, where are you going?
- Bathroom.

21:10.700 --> 21:13.900
<i>Johnny!</i>

21:14.100 --> 21:19.000
- Oh.
- I'm so lonely

21:19.500 --> 21:22.200
I'm so lonely

21:22.400 --> 21:25.200
I'm so lonely I could die

21:25.500 --> 21:29.900
- Well, can you live with it?
- What?

21:30.200 --> 21:32.700
- I said, can you live with it?
- Live with what?

21:32.800 --> 21:36.000
That son of a bitch walkin' around,
breathing the same air as you,

21:36.300 --> 21:39.200
gettin' away with it every day.

21:39.400 --> 21:43.000
- Are you haunted?
- Yeah.

21:43.100 --> 21:46.600
- You wanna get un-haunted?
- Oh, yeah.

21:46.900 --> 21:50.600
Well, I'd kill him, shoot him in the face,

21:50.900 --> 21:53.100
put him down like a dog.

21:53.100 --> 21:56.500
- I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
- I'm just sayin' what I'd do.

21:56.800 --> 22:01.000
- You'd do that?
- Fuck don't deserve to live.

22:01.300 --> 22:04.700
Look, he's hauntin' me, you know? I mean,

22:04.900 --> 22:08.100
I do wanna kill him, but I don't wanna
spend the rest of my life in jail.

22:08.400 --> 22:11.400
- Hey, man, I don't blame you.
- If I thought I'd get away with it--

22:11.500 --> 22:15.400
Get away with it? Killing's the hard part.

22:15.700 --> 22:19.800
Gettin' away with it, that's easy.
You think a cop gives a fuck about a pimp?

22:21.300 --> 22:24.200
Listen. Every pimp in the world gets shot.

22:24.300 --> 22:28.400
2 in the back of the fuckin' head.
Cops'd throw a party, man.

22:31.800 --> 22:35.400
As long as you're not at the scene of
the crime, smokin' gun in your hand,

22:35.700 --> 22:37.800
you'd get away with it.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.400
Clarence, I like you. I always have.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.400
Always will.

23:07.600 --> 23:12.400
- 'Bama.
- Where are you goin'?

23:13.300 --> 23:15.900
I need you to write down
your former address.

23:16.900 --> 23:17.900
Why?

23:18.000 --> 23:21.100
Well, so I can go over there and
pick up your stuff. That's why.

23:21.400 --> 23:25.000
Oh, baby. Come on, Clarence.
I just wanna disappear from there.

23:25.200 --> 23:28.400
Look, 'Bama, I know he scares the shit out of
you, but I'm not scared of that motherfucker.

23:28.700 --> 23:32.000
You are completely out of his reach.
He poses no threat to you.

23:32.200 --> 23:36.300
If he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it
would seem silly, you to lose all your things.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.200
- Now, that's all.
- Listen.

23:39.300 --> 23:43.400
- You don't know him.
- No. You don't know me,

23:43.600 --> 23:46.500
not when it comes to shit like this.

23:46.700 --> 23:52.200
I need to do this. I want you to know
that you can count on me to protect you.

23:54.800 --> 23:58.300
Come on. Please. Just write it down.

24:06.300 --> 24:10.200
- This isn't a good idea.
- I tell ya, it's gonna be fine.

24:10.500 --> 24:13.600
I'll be in and out of there.

24:15.500 --> 24:18.300
- Be careful.
- I will.

24:21.500 --> 24:25.100
- I love you.
- Love you too.

25:28.100 --> 25:31.100
- You want something?
- Hey. You Drexl?

25:31.200 --> 25:34.900
- No, man. I'm Marty.
- Well, I wanna talk to Drexl.

25:35.000 --> 25:40.300
- What the fuck you wanna talk to him about?
- It's about Alabama.

25:55.200 --> 25:58.000
He was askin' about Alabama.

25:59.500 --> 26:02.900
- Where the fuck is that bitch?
- She's with me.

26:03.100 --> 26:06.500
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm her husband.

26:11.400 --> 26:14.300
Well, that makes us practically related.

26:16.100 --> 26:18.800
You have a seat, boy.
Grab yourself a'egg roll.

26:18.900 --> 26:21.800
We got everything here from a
Little-Eyed Joe to damned if I know.

26:22.100 --> 26:24.400
No, thanks.

26:28.200 --> 26:32.500
"No, thanks"? What that mean, hmm?

26:32.700 --> 26:35.500
I think you're too scared to be eatin'.

26:42.300 --> 26:46.900
Now, see, we're sittin' down
here, ready to negotiate,

26:47.200 --> 26:50.000
and you've already given up your shit.

26:50.200 --> 26:55.100
I'm still a mystery to you, but I know
exactly where your white ass is comin' from.

26:55.400 --> 26:59.600
See, if I ask if you want some dinner and
you grab a' egg roll and start to chow down,

26:59.800 --> 27:02.600
I say to myself, this motherfucker,
he's carryin' on like he ain't got a care.

27:02.800 --> 27:06.000
And who knows? Maybe he don't.

27:06.300 --> 27:11.800
Maybe this fool is such a bad motherfucker,
he don't got to worry about nothin'.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.800
He just sit down, watch my motherfuckin' TV.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.900
See?

27:20.300 --> 27:23.200
You ain't even sat down yet.

27:23.400 --> 27:26.600
Man, that TV over there-- Since you been in the
room, there's a woman with her "breastuses"...

27:26.800 --> 27:31.100
hangin' out, and you ain't
even bothered to look.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.900
You just been clockin' me.

27:36.800 --> 27:39.700
I know I'm pretty,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.900
but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.

27:43.100 --> 27:47.300
Ooh, wee! This child be fierce.

27:59.100 --> 28:03.100
I'm not eatin' 'cause I'm not hungry.
I'm not sittin' 'cause I'm not stayin'.

28:03.400 --> 28:07.100
I ain't lookin' at the movie 'cause
I already seen it 7 years ago.

28:07.400 --> 28:11.200
It's The Mack. Max Julian,
Carol Speed and Richard Pryor.

28:11.300 --> 28:15.100
I ain't scared of ya. I just don't like ya.

28:15.400 --> 28:19.100
In that envelope right there is some payoff
money. Alabama is movin' to greener pastures.

28:19.400 --> 28:23.400
We're not negotiatin'. I don't barter. What's
in that envelope is for my peace of mind.

28:23.700 --> 28:27.700
My peace of mind is worth
that much, not one penny more.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.700
It's empty.

28:48.500 --> 28:51.300
Marty, you know what we got here?

28:51.500 --> 28:54.600
Motherfuckin' Charlie Bronson.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.100
Mr.Majestyk?

28:57.200 --> 29:00.500
Lookie here, Charlie.

29:00.700 --> 29:05.700
None of this bullshit is necessary.
I don't got no hold over Alabama.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.800
I was just tryin' to lend
the girl a helpin' hand.

29:41.800 --> 29:44.900
- Come here, you mother--

30:07.100 --> 30:10.100
This is what you get...

30:10.300 --> 30:13.000
if you fuck with me, white boy!

30:13.200 --> 30:16.200
Talkin' that smack in front
of my motherfuckin' freaks!

30:16.500 --> 30:20.000
Shit, motherfucker! Your ass gotta be crazy!

30:29.100 --> 30:33.400
You must've thought it
was white boy day, huh?

30:33.700 --> 30:37.300
- It ain't white boy day, is it?
- No, man. It ain't white boy day.

30:37.500 --> 30:42.600
Shit, man. You done fucked up again. Huh?

30:56.700 --> 31:01.400
Well, well, well. Lookie what we got here.

31:01.700 --> 31:05.100
"Clarence Worley"?

31:06.700 --> 31:12.400
It sounds almost like a nigger
name. And I know where you live.

31:18.500 --> 31:22.500
And I make a million-dollar bet
that Alabama is at the same address.

31:22.800 --> 31:28.000
Marty, take the car. Go get her.
Bring her dumb ass back here.

31:28.200 --> 31:32.600
- I think I'll keep lover boy here entertained.
- Roxanne, where's my jacket?

31:32.800 --> 31:38.100
- Hey, Roxanne!
- Hey, Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?

31:38.400 --> 31:42.400
- I gotta find my jacket.
- Look in the fuckin' hamper.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.800
Drexl?

31:51.000 --> 31:54.100
You! Get a bag and put
Alabama's things in it.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.700
Wanna get fuckin' shot? Get a bag
and put Alabama's things in it.

31:57.900 --> 32:02.000
I just did you the biggest
fuckin' favor of your life!

32:02.300 --> 32:07.200
Open your eyes. I said,
open your fuckin' eyes!

32:07.400 --> 32:10.800
You thought it was pretty
fuckin' funny, didn't you?

32:11.100 --> 32:15.300
Well, fuck you! Fuck you, you piece of shit!

32:18.400 --> 32:20.200
Don't fuckin' move!

32:20.200 --> 32:23.000
<i>I was selfish. I know I was selfish.</i>

32:23.300 --> 32:28.400
<i>I was, but I was carrying your child.</i>

32:30.400 --> 32:32.700
<i>Please don't leave.</i>

32:34.300 --> 32:37.100
<i>And if I told you--</i>

32:39.400 --> 32:43.900
I killed him. Want a hamburger or
somethin'? I'm fuckin' starvin' to death.

32:44.100 --> 32:48.300
- Is this a joke?
- No joke.

32:50.200 --> 32:53.100
That's probably the best goddamn fuckin'
hamburger I ever had in my entire life.

32:53.300 --> 32:56.200
I've never had a hamburger taste this good.

32:56.300 --> 32:59.500
Come on. Eat something. You'll feel better.

33:00.900 --> 33:04.400
<i>You and I had this one night.</i>

33:04.600 --> 33:06.300
What the fuck you cryin' for, huh?

33:08.500 --> 33:10.700
I mean, Christ, he's not
worth one of your tears.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.800
Would you rather it have
been me? Is that it, huh?

33:13.900 --> 33:17.500
Is that what you want? I mean,
do you love him? Do you love him?

33:17.800 --> 33:20.400
I said, do you fuckin' love him, huh?

33:20.600 --> 33:24.100
- I think what you did wa-- - What?
- I think what you did...

33:24.400 --> 33:29.400
- What?
- was so romantic.

33:32.900 --> 33:33.900
Yeah.

33:35.700 --> 33:39.100
- Oh, baby, you're bleeding.
- Yeah.

33:41.200 --> 33:44.400
I got your things right here.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.100
Clean clothes.

33:49.800 --> 33:51.800
- I love you.
- I love you.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.100
There's a God.

34:17.600 --> 34:21.900
The-- These aren't my clothes.

34:22.500 --> 34:25.300
A little bitty tear let me down

34:25.400 --> 34:28.400
Spoilin' my act as a clown

34:28.600 --> 34:31.300
I was all made up not to frown

34:31.500 --> 34:34.800
But a little bitty tear let me down

34:35.100 --> 34:38.199
A little bitty tear let me down

34:38.300 --> 34:41.300
Spoilin' my act as a clown

34:41.400 --> 34:43.900
Rommel, where are you?
Come here. Come on, boy.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.400
Get in here. You get in here
now. Get in there. Go on.

34:47.699 --> 34:50.900
<i>You said you were leavin' tomorrow</i>

34:51.100 --> 34:54.500
<i>That today was our last day</i>

34:54.800 --> 34:58.100
<i>I said there'd be no sorrow</i>

34:58.200 --> 35:01.000
<i>That I'd laugh when you walked away</i>

35:01.100 --> 35:04.400
<i>A little bitty tear let me down</i>

35:04.700 --> 35:07.500
<i>Spoiled my act as a clown</i>

35:07.700 --> 35:10.400
<i>I had it made up not to make a frown</i>

35:10.600 --> 35:14.200
<i>But a little bitty tear let me down</i>

35:17.000 --> 35:20.700
Good mornin', Daddy. Hey, Rommel.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.900
Long time, no see, huh? Oh,
yeah. Good boy. Good boy.

35:28.600 --> 35:32.600
Now, you're gonna have to excuse the place.

35:32.800 --> 35:36.200
I haven't been exactly doin'
a lot of entertainment...

35:36.500 --> 35:39.300
of company as of late.

35:39.500 --> 35:42.500
I'm sorry if I seem a little tense,

35:42.700 --> 35:46.900
but you're the last person in the world
that I expected to see this morning.

35:47.200 --> 35:50.100
That's okay, Dad. I tend to
have that effect on people.

35:50.400 --> 35:54.000
You, uh, you got anything to drink
around here? I'm dyin' of thirst.

35:54.100 --> 35:58.700
There should be-- There
should be a 7 UP in there.

35:59.000 --> 36:04.100
Anything stronger? Probably not.
Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?

36:04.400 --> 36:08.800
I can, but I don't.

36:09.100 --> 36:12.800
Yeah, that's about all I ever eat.

36:14.100 --> 36:15.300
Excuse me.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.400
Hello, hello, hello. I'm his father.

36:19.600 --> 36:24.100
- How are you?
- That's all right. I'm his wife, Alabama Worley.

36:24.500 --> 36:28.400
- Pleased to meet ya.
- We got married.

36:30.900 --> 36:31.900
Yeah.

36:44.800 --> 36:48.500
Well, lover, why don't you be
a sport and go get us some beer?

36:48.800 --> 36:52.300
You want some beer? I mean, if
you want some, it'll be here.

36:52.500 --> 36:55.100
All right? Where is there
a liquor store around here?

36:55.300 --> 36:58.000
There's a party store down on 54th Street.

36:58.200 --> 37:01.600
Get a 6-pack of somethin' imported.

37:01.900 --> 37:06.000
Hard to tell you what to get, 'cause
different places have different things. Here.

37:06.300 --> 37:09.300
- That should cover it. Okey-dokey.
- Okey-dokey, Doggy Daddy.

37:09.500 --> 37:12.100
Okay.

37:20.400 --> 37:24.200
Ain't she the sweetest goddamn thing
you ever saw in your whole life?

37:24.500 --> 37:27.200
I mean, she-- she a 4-alarm fire or what?

37:29.200 --> 37:33.100
- She seems very nice.
- Nice?

37:33.300 --> 37:36.300
Daddy, "nice" ain't the word. I mean,
this girl, she's a peach, you know?

37:36.400 --> 37:39.500
She even tastes like a peach.

37:39.800 --> 37:43.700
You can tell I'm in
love with her, can't you?

37:44.000 --> 37:46.700
No. Wait. I gotta talk.

37:46.800 --> 37:51.000
Clarence, sit down, shut up.

37:51.300 --> 37:53.800
You're givin' me a fuckin' headache.

37:53.900 --> 37:57.600
I mean, you're so much like
your mother I can't believe it.

37:57.900 --> 38:03.100
You're your fuckin' mother through and
through. I haven't heard from you in 3 years.

38:03.400 --> 38:07.100
You show up all of a sudden
at 8:00 in the morning.

38:07.400 --> 38:10.700
You walk in here like a goddamn bulldozer.

38:10.800 --> 38:14.200
And don't get me wrong. I
love you. I'm glad to see you.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.300
But slow it down, man.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.300
All right?

38:23.100 --> 38:24.900
Now,

38:27.600 --> 38:30.000
when did you get married?

38:31.100 --> 38:33.900
Daddy, uh...

38:36.200 --> 38:39.500
I'm in big fuckin' trouble.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.100
I really need your help.

38:42.200 --> 38:45.900
No, no, no, no. Stop talking.

38:46.200 --> 38:49.400
- What do you want from me?
- What?

38:49.500 --> 38:53.000
What do you want from me?
Stop acting like an infant.

38:53.300 --> 38:58.400
You're here because you want me to help you
in some way. What do you need from me? Money?

38:58.700 --> 39:02.900
- No. You still have friends on the force?
- Yes, I still have friends.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.800
Well, then, could you just find out if they
know anything about us? I don't think...

39:06.000 --> 39:08.300
they know shit, but I don't wanna
think; I wanna know for sure.

39:08.500 --> 39:12.300
- You could do that, right?
- What makes you think that I could do that?

39:12.500 --> 39:16.800
- 'Cause you were a cop.
- But what makes you think that I would do that?

39:17.000 --> 39:21.700
- 'Cause I'm your son.
- Oh, you're my son.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.600
Oh, you got it, huh, all
worked out, don't you, huh?

39:25.900 --> 39:29.100
- Oh, yeah.
- Look. I mean, goddamn, I have never
asked you for a goddamn thing.

39:29.300 --> 39:34.200
But Jesus fuckin' Christ, after Mom divorced
you, did I ever ask you for anything?

39:34.400 --> 39:38.200
No, I didn't. When I wouldn't see
you for a year and a half to 2 years,

39:38.400 --> 39:40.300
did I ever get in your shit about it?

39:40.400 --> 39:43.400
And that whole fuckin' time you were drunk,
did I ever get mad and point my finger at you?

39:43.600 --> 39:46.400
No, I never did. Everybody
else did, but I didn't.

39:46.500 --> 39:49.800
Now, look. I just need help, and
you can fuckin' help me, all right?

39:50.100 --> 39:54.700
Now, I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy.
If I didn't need it, I wouldn't ask.

39:56.500 --> 40:00.300
I mean, if you wanna say
no, then fine, forget it.

40:00.600 --> 40:03.400
Don't worry about it. No
problem. I'm goin'. All right?

40:09.300 --> 40:11.000
The Virgin's back!

40:12.800 --> 40:15.000
Thank God. I could eat a horse if
you slapped enough ketchup on it.

40:15.200 --> 40:18.300
- I didn't get you any chicken.
- Well, how come?

40:18.500 --> 40:21.400
Honey, it's too early in
the morning. It's only 9:00.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.500
Son of a bitch.

40:30.500 --> 40:34.700
- Dick Ritchie. Dick Ritchie!
- That's me. I'm me.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.900
- Come inside.
- Okay.

40:43.700 --> 40:46.700
Sit. Sit, sit, sit.

40:46.800 --> 40:50.200
Now, the part you'll be reading
for is one of the bad guys.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.600
- There's Brian and Marty.
- Who?

40:52.800 --> 40:55.900
- Is there a problem?
- No. No.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.600
Peter Breck has already been
cast in the part of Brian.

40:58.800 --> 41:01.000
So you'll be reading for the role of Marty.

41:01.100 --> 41:03.000
In this scene, you're both in a car,

41:03.100 --> 41:05.700
and Bill Shatner is hanging on the hood.

41:05.800 --> 41:08.500
What you wanna do is get him off.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.400
All right. I'm Marty.

41:12.100 --> 41:15.900
- Ready?
- Yeah. Okay.

41:16.200 --> 41:19.500
I'm driving. Okay.

41:19.800 --> 41:22.900
- Where the fuck did he come from?
- I don't know.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.800
- He just appeared like magic.
- Well, don't just sit there.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.300
Shoot him.

41:27.500 --> 41:29.100
Get him!

41:29.200 --> 41:34.800
Thank you, Mr.Ritchie. I'm very
impressed. You're a very fine actor.

41:35.100 --> 41:38.200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

41:38.400 --> 41:41.700
- We'll let you know.
- Okay.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.900
- Okay, one-handed.
- One-handed. There we go.

41:45.700 --> 41:47.100
Then the other one there.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.600
Here comes the train.

41:58.200 --> 42:00.700
Well, they found nothing.

42:00.900 --> 42:04.000
In fact, they think it's drug related.

42:04.300 --> 42:07.100
Uh, drug related? Why drug related?

42:07.300 --> 42:09.900
Well, apparently, Drexl had
his big toe stuck in that shit.

42:10.000 --> 42:14.800
- Really?
- Drexl had an association with a fellow named Blue Lou Boyle.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.200
- Name mean anything to you?
- No.

42:18.500 --> 42:20.600
Well, if you don't hang around
his circle, no reason it should.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.800
- Why? Who is he?
- Gangster, drug dealer.

42:22.900 --> 42:25.800
Somebody that you don't want on
your ass. Now, look, Clarence,

42:26.100 --> 42:29.200
the more I hear about this Drexl fucker,

42:29.400 --> 42:31.200
the more I think you did the right thing.

42:31.400 --> 42:33.300
This guy wasn't just some wild flake.

42:33.400 --> 42:36.000
No, man. That's what I was
trying to tell you before.

42:36.200 --> 42:38.900
The guy was like a mad dog.

42:39.100 --> 42:41.900
So, the cops, they don't
think-- They're not after us.

42:42.100 --> 42:44.400
No. Until they hear something better,

42:44.600 --> 42:48.100
they'll just assume Drexl had
a falling-out with Blue Lou.

42:48.400 --> 42:52.200
And once you leave town, I
wouldn't even worry about it.

42:53.900 --> 42:56.600
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You
really came through for me.

42:59.300 --> 43:01.100
I got some money I could give you.

43:01.300 --> 43:03.400
No. Keep it. Keep it.

43:04.800 --> 43:07.000
Well, now, son,

43:07.200 --> 43:09.700
I want you to know that, uh,

43:09.800 --> 43:13.100
I hope everything works
out with you and Alabama.

43:13.300 --> 43:15.100
I like her.

43:16.900 --> 43:20.300
And I think you... make a real cute couple.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.700
Yeah, well, now, you--
you stay out of trouble.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.800
Hmm?

43:27.900 --> 43:32.500
Remember, you got a--you got
a wife to think about now.

43:32.800 --> 43:35.600
Quit fuckin' around.

43:37.400 --> 43:39.400
Son...

43:41.700 --> 43:43.800
I love you.

43:52.100 --> 43:54.500
- All right.
- All right.

43:54.700 --> 43:58.600
This is my friend Dick Ritchie's
number and address in Hollywood.

43:58.800 --> 44:00.700
That's where we're gonna be.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.700
You can get in touch with me through him.

44:02.800 --> 44:05.600
Come on, Alabama. We're
taking off. Kiss Pops good-bye.

44:09.600 --> 44:12.700
Bye, Daddy. Hope to see you again soon.

44:15.900 --> 44:19.400
Hey! Hey! What kind of smackaroo is that?

44:23.300 --> 44:26.000
- We'll send you a postcard from Hollywood, all right?
- Alabama.

44:26.100 --> 44:27.700
- Alabama.
- Yes, sir?

44:27.900 --> 44:30.300
- Take care of that one for me.
- Don't worry, Daddy.

44:30.500 --> 44:33.400
- I'm gonna keep this fellow on a short leash.
- As the sun sets...

44:33.600 --> 44:36.700
slowly in the West, we
bid you a fond farewell.

44:40.900 --> 44:43.300
- Bye, Daddy!
- See you later, Pops!

44:43.500 --> 44:45.700
Son of a bitch was right.

44:45.900 --> 44:48.800
She tastes like a peach. Come on, Rommel!

44:49.000 --> 44:51.400
Come on, boy! Come on! Come on!

45:07.400 --> 45:08.100
Hello.

45:08.400 --> 45:10.400
- Hello, baby!
- Hello, baby!

45:10.600 --> 45:12.200
- Clarence?
- You got it.

45:12.400 --> 45:15.100
Clarence, it's great to hear
from you. What's going on?

45:15.300 --> 45:19.000
- Well, you are gonna be seeing me shortly.
- You're coming to L.A.? When?

45:19.300 --> 45:21.100
Uh, tomorrow.

45:21.300 --> 45:24.100
There is a story behind all that.
I will tell you when I see you.

45:24.200 --> 45:27.200
And by the way, I ain't gonna be
alone. I am bringing my lovely wife.

45:27.400 --> 45:30.000
Get the fuck out of here.
Clarence, you got married?

45:30.200 --> 45:32.600
- I'm a married man, buddy.
- Chantilly lace

45:32.700 --> 45:35.300
I'm a married man. You wanna say
hello to my better half? Come here.

45:35.500 --> 45:39.300
- Hi, Dick. This is Alabama Worley.
- How you doing, Alabama?

45:39.600 --> 45:43.400
Hi. Clarence told me all about you.
He said you were his best friend.

45:43.600 --> 45:47.600
- So I guess that makes you my best friend too.
- Tell him we gotta go.

45:47.700 --> 45:50.700
- Clarence says we gotta be going.
- Can I speak to Clarence?

45:51.000 --> 45:53.600
- Ask him if he got the letter.
- Did you get the letter?

45:53.800 --> 45:55.900
- What letter?
- What letter?

45:56.100 --> 45:57.600
- Letters.
- Letters.

45:57.700 --> 46:00.100
- I didn't get any letter.
- Has he gotten his mail yet?

46:00.300 --> 46:03.600
- Have you gotten your mail yet?
- Well, no. My roommate Floyd--

46:03.800 --> 46:09.100
- Has he looked through it?
- Have you looked through it? No.

46:09.400 --> 46:11.500
Tell him to go look through it.

46:11.700 --> 46:14.200
Go and, uh-- Go look through it.

46:14.400 --> 46:18.100
Wait. Can I speak to Clarence, please?

46:18.400 --> 46:21.500
- He wants to talk to you.
- No time. Tell him we gotta go.

46:21.700 --> 46:24.000
- No time. Read the letter.
- Read the letter.

46:24.200 --> 46:26.300
Tell him I love him.
Tell him as of tomorrow--

46:26.500 --> 46:28.800
- He loves you. Honey, hold this.
- All right.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.800
- As of tomorrow, all of his money problems...
- As of tomorrow,

46:31.000 --> 46:35.500
- are gonna be over.
- all your money problems are gonna be... over.

46:35.700 --> 46:38.000
Hello? What money problems?

46:42.800 --> 46:45.600
Hello? Hello?

46:45.800 --> 46:47.500
You know what I like

46:47.600 --> 46:51.200
Chantilly lace and a pretty face

46:51.300 --> 46:53.900
A ponytail hangin' down

46:54.100 --> 46:56.700
A wiggle in the walk and
a giggle in the talk, Lord

46:56.800 --> 46:58.600
Make the world go 'round

46:58.600 --> 47:01.700
Floyd, you used up the
last piece of toilet paper!

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
Make me act so funny Make me spend my money

47:05.200 --> 47:07.500
Make me feel real loose
like a long-necked goose

47:07.700 --> 47:11.000
Oh, baby that's-a what I like

47:23.300 --> 47:25.200
Hey! Hey! Rommel!

47:25.300 --> 47:28.100
Hey, come here! Rommel! Rommel!

47:48.800 --> 47:52.800
Frankie, tell Luca to go
outside and do you know what.

48:00.600 --> 48:04.000
Do you know who I am, Mr.Worley?

48:05.900 --> 48:08.000
I give up. Who are you?

48:08.200 --> 48:12.800
I'm the Antichrist. You got
me in a vendetta kind of mood.

48:13.100 --> 48:17.000
You tell the angels in heaven you've never
seen evil so singularly personified...

48:17.300 --> 48:19.700
as you did in the face
of the man who killed you.

48:19.900 --> 48:23.900
My name is Vincent Coccotti. I work
as counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle,

48:24.100 --> 48:26.000
the man your son stole from.

48:26.100 --> 48:30.800
I hear you were once a cop, so I can
assume you have heard of us before.

48:31.100 --> 48:34.300
- Am I correct?
- I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.

48:34.600 --> 48:36.500
I'm glad.

48:36.700 --> 48:40.700
Hopefully, that will clear up the
"how full of shit am I" question...

48:40.800 --> 48:43.500
you've been asking yourself.

48:43.600 --> 48:45.500
We're gonna have a little Q and A.

48:45.600 --> 48:48.800
And at the risk of sounding redundant,

48:49.000 --> 48:51.500
please make your answers genuine.

48:51.700 --> 48:54.000
You want a Chesterfield?

48:54.100 --> 48:56.100
No.

48:56.300 --> 48:59.800
I have a son of my own,
about your boy's age.

48:59.900 --> 49:02.800
I can imagine how painful
this must be for you.

49:02.900 --> 49:05.100
But Clarence...

49:05.300 --> 49:08.200
and that bitch of a girlfriend of
his brought this all on themselves.

49:08.500 --> 49:12.100
I implore you not to go
down that road with them.

49:12.300 --> 49:15.900
You could always take comfort in
the fact you never had a choice.

49:17.900 --> 49:22.100
Look, I'd like to help you if I
could, but I haven't seen Clarence.

49:26.300 --> 49:29.200
- You see that?
- Ah, shit!

49:29.400 --> 49:32.000
- Fuck!
- That smarts, doesn't it?

49:32.200 --> 49:34.400
To get slammed in the nose.

49:34.600 --> 49:36.400
Fucks you all up.

49:36.500 --> 49:39.300
You get that pain shooting through your brain.
Your eyes fill up with water.

49:39.500 --> 49:42.400
That ain't any kind of fun.

49:42.700 --> 49:47.300
But what I have to offer you,
that's as good as it's gonna get.

49:47.600 --> 49:50.400
And it won't ever get that good again.

49:50.600 --> 49:55.100
We talked to your neighbors.
They saw a Cadillac.

49:55.400 --> 49:57.200
Purple Cadillac.

49:57.400 --> 50:01.900
Clarence's purple Cadillac, parked
in front of your trailer yesterday.

50:02.200 --> 50:06.200
Mr.Worley, you seen your son?

50:06.300 --> 50:09.100
- I've seen him.
- I can't be sure...

50:09.300 --> 50:11.500
of how much of what he told you, so...

50:11.700 --> 50:13.700
in the chance you're in
the dark about some of this,

50:13.900 --> 50:15.700
let me shed some light.

50:15.900 --> 50:17.700
That whore your boy hangs around with,

50:17.900 --> 50:20.600
her pimp is an associate of mine.

50:20.800 --> 50:22.600
Among his pimping and other affairs,

50:22.800 --> 50:24.700
he works for me in a courier capacity.

50:24.900 --> 50:26.800
Well, apparently,

50:26.900 --> 50:30.300
that dirty little whore found out
we were gonna do some business...

50:30.500 --> 50:33.300
'cause your son, the
cowboy, and his flame...

50:33.600 --> 50:36.500
came into the room
blazing and didn't stop...

50:36.600 --> 50:38.800
until they were pretty
sure everybody was dead.

50:40.200 --> 50:42.400
What are you talking about?

50:42.600 --> 50:44.900
I'm talking about a massacre.

50:45.100 --> 50:47.100
They snatched my narcotics.

50:47.300 --> 50:50.000
Hightailed it out of there.
Would have got away with it,

50:50.100 --> 50:53.300
but your son, fuck-head that he is,

50:53.600 --> 50:57.800
left his driver's license
in the dead guy's hand.

50:59.800 --> 51:04.000
- You know, I don't believe you.
- That's of minor importance.

51:04.300 --> 51:08.500
What is of major fucking
importance is that I believe you.

51:08.800 --> 51:11.300
Where did they go?

51:11.500 --> 51:14.100
On their honeymoon.

51:19.500 --> 51:22.300
I'm getting angry asking
the same question a 2nd time.

51:22.600 --> 51:24.900
- Where did they go?
- They didn't tell me.

51:25.100 --> 51:27.500
You just wait a minute and listen to me.

51:27.700 --> 51:30.100
I haven't seen Clarence in 3 years.

51:30.300 --> 51:32.600
He shows up yesterday...

51:32.700 --> 51:36.200
with a young girl, saying
that he got married.

51:37.800 --> 51:40.400
He asked for, uh,

51:40.600 --> 51:44.500
some quick cash to go on a honeymoon.

51:44.800 --> 51:48.500
He asked me if he could borrow $500.

51:48.600 --> 51:51.800
I felt like helping him,
so I wrote him out a check.

51:52.100 --> 51:55.500
We went to breakfast in the morning.

51:55.700 --> 51:58.500
And that's the last I saw of him,

51:58.600 --> 52:01.300
so help me God.

52:01.600 --> 52:04.800
They never thought to tell
me where they were going.

52:06.600 --> 52:09.300
And I never thought to ask.

52:22.200 --> 52:23.800
No!

52:31.700 --> 52:35.500
Don Vincenzo.

52:40.800 --> 52:46.200
You know, Sicilians are great liars.

52:46.400 --> 52:49.200
The best in the world.

52:51.100 --> 52:52.900
I'm Sicilian.

52:53.100 --> 52:57.200
My father was the world heavy
weight champion of Sicilian liars.

52:57.500 --> 53:01.700
From growing up with him,
I learned the pantomime.

53:01.900 --> 53:05.900
There are 17 different things a guy can
do when he lies to give himself away.

53:06.100 --> 53:09.500
A guy's got 17 pantomimes. A woman's got 20.

53:09.800 --> 53:14.000
A guy's got 17. But if you know
them like you know your own face,

53:14.100 --> 53:16.100
they'd beat lie detectors all to hell.

53:16.200 --> 53:19.800
Now, what we got here is a
little game of show-and-tell.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.700
You don't wanna show me nothing,
but you're telling me everything.

53:24.500 --> 53:28.500
I know you know where
they are, so... tell me...

53:28.800 --> 53:32.100
before I do some damage
you won't walk away from.

53:35.300 --> 53:38.200
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?

53:40.500 --> 53:43.000
Sure.

53:47.300 --> 53:51.000
You got a... match? No. Wait. No, no.

53:51.300 --> 53:53.400
Don't bother. I got one.

54:03.400 --> 54:07.300
- You're Sicilian, huh?
- Yeah. Sicilian.

54:11.600 --> 54:12.600
You know...

54:14.700 --> 54:16.800
I read a lot,

54:17.000 --> 54:19.400
especially about things-- about history.

54:21.200 --> 54:23.900
I find that shit fascinating.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.500
Here's a fact I don't know
whether you know or not.

54:32.200 --> 54:35.900
Sicilians were spawned by niggers.

54:43.300 --> 54:45.500
Come again?

54:45.600 --> 54:49.000
No, it's-- it's a fact.
Yeah. You see, uh,

54:49.200 --> 54:51.900
Sicilians have, uh,

54:52.000 --> 54:54.500
black blood pumping through their hearts.

54:54.800 --> 54:59.300
If you-- If you don't believe
me, uh, you can look it up.

54:59.600 --> 55:02.900
Hundreds and hundreds of
years ago, uh, you see, um,

55:03.000 --> 55:05.700
the Moors conquered Sicily.

55:05.900 --> 55:07.700
And the Moors are niggers.

55:07.900 --> 55:11.300
You see, way back then, uh,

55:11.500 --> 55:14.800
Sicilians were like, uh,
wops from northern Italy.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
They all had blond hair and blue eyes.

55:17.200 --> 55:19.900
But, uh, well--

55:20.100 --> 55:22.900
then the Moors moved in there, and...

55:24.300 --> 55:27.100
well, they changed the whole country.

55:27.200 --> 55:31.800
They did so much fucking
with Sicilian women...

55:32.100 --> 55:35.500
that they changed the
whole bloodline forever.

55:35.600 --> 55:37.700
That's why...

55:37.800 --> 55:42.900
blond hair and blue eyes
became black hair and dark skin.

55:43.200 --> 55:46.800
You know, it's absolutely amazing to me...

55:49.000 --> 55:52.500
to think that to this day,
hundreds of years later,

55:52.700 --> 55:56.900
that-- that Sicilians...

55:57.200 --> 56:00.000
still carry that nigger gene.

56:01.400 --> 56:03.300
Now, this--

56:03.400 --> 56:05.400
No, I'm quoting history.

56:07.000 --> 56:10.500
It's written. It's a fact. It's written.

56:10.800 --> 56:13.300
- I love this guy.
- No.

56:18.100 --> 56:20.500
Your ancestors are niggers. Huh?

56:22.000 --> 56:23.200
Hey.

56:23.400 --> 56:25.400
Yeah.

56:25.600 --> 56:29.600
And-- And your
great-great-great-great- grandmother

56:29.900 --> 56:32.800
fucked a nigger.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.900
Yeah. And she had a half-nigger kid.

56:36.100 --> 56:41.200
Now, if that's a fact, tell me,

56:41.500 --> 56:43.900
am I lying?

56:47.300 --> 56:49.200
'Cause you--

56:51.200 --> 56:54.400
you're part eggplant.

56:59.700 --> 57:03.400
Huh? Hey, hey, hey.

57:03.500 --> 57:06.100
You're a cantaloupe.

57:16.500 --> 57:18.900
That's beautiful.

57:39.500 --> 57:42.700
I haven't killed anybody...

57:43.000 --> 57:44.800
since 1984.

57:48.300 --> 57:50.200
Go to this comedian's son's apartment.

57:50.400 --> 57:54.800
Come back with something that
tells me where that asshole went...

57:55.000 --> 57:56.800
so I can wipe this egg off my face.

58:10.900 --> 58:14.000
Fix this fucked-up family for good.

58:19.300 --> 58:21.200
Hey, boss.

58:21.300 --> 58:24.500
Get ready to be happy.

58:25.300 --> 58:27.600
<i>Morning, everybody.
It's 6:22 here in L.A.</i>

58:27.700 --> 58:29.700
<i>I'm David Perry at K.B.L.U.</i>

58:46.500 --> 58:49.500
Hello? Hi.

58:54.900 --> 58:56.000
Floyd.

58:58.300 --> 59:01.100
Floyd. Can't you answer
the door at least for me?

59:01.400 --> 59:03.200
Oh, man, I didn't even hear it.

59:05.000 --> 59:05.900
Hello?

59:06.000 --> 59:08.200
- You can't help me out every now and then?
- Hi.

59:08.200 --> 59:10.100
Yes.

59:12.200 --> 59:14.000
You call for a date?

59:15.000 --> 59:18.200
- Hey!
- I knew it was you! How you doing?

59:20.100 --> 59:22.800
- Dick, this is Alabama. Alabama, this is Dick.
- Nice to meet you.

59:23.100 --> 59:25.500
- How long have you been living here?
- Hi. I'm Alabama.

59:25.700 --> 59:28.300
- Clarence, you look good.
- This is a great place. This is nice.

59:28.500 --> 59:31.000
I'm starving. Let's get
something to eat. Who's this?

59:31.200 --> 59:33.000
- It's Floyd.
- Floyd. Let's go.

59:33.200 --> 59:36.600
Okay, Floyd, watch yourself. Be careful.

59:36.700 --> 59:38.700
Hey.

59:52.600 --> 59:54.400
Hey, I didn't tell you guys yet?

59:54.500 --> 59:58.000
I had this really, really good
audition for TJ Hooker the other day.

59:58.300 --> 01:00:02.000
- You're gonna be on TJ Hooker?
- Yeah. It's the new TJ Hooker.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:05.100
- Knock on wood.
- You get to meet Captain Kirk?

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.300
Well, you don't get to
meet him in the audition.

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.900
But if I get the part-- Hope, hope.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.700
- That would be amazing.
- It would be cool. It would be a real--

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.600
Meeting Captain Kirk, that would be cool.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.300
Here we are.

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.500
The honeymoon suite.

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:35.900
You're really in love, aren't you?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.300
Very first time in my life.
You know what that's like?

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.400
No.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.000
- Nah.
- Shut the fuck up. Hey.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.100
What are you doing in L.A. anyway, huh?

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:55.900
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.000
This shit can't be real.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.300
- It'll get you high.
- What?

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.100
- I said, it'll get you high.
- Hey, we got cable.

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:06.900
- You want some wine, sweetheart?
- Yeah, just a little bit.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.100
I'm not much of a wine gal.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.900
This stuff is fucking real.
This is fucking real, Clarence.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:18.500
- I certainly hope so.
- You've got a hell of a lot of cocaine here, man.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.200
- I know.
- Do you realize how much fucking coke you have here?

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:24.200
No. Tell me.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.900
I don't know, but it's a fucking lot.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.300
This is-- This is Drexl's coke?

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.800
No, Drexl's dead, you
see. It's Clarence's coke.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And Clarence, he can do
whatever he wants with it.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.100
What Clarence wants to do is to sell it.

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:40.600
Then me and 'Bama, we're gonna jump a jet plane
and spend the rest of our lives spending it.

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.900
You got my letter? You
lined up buyers for me?

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:46.800
- Listen, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine, okay?
- You're an actor.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.200
I hear these Hollywood guys get it
delivered to the set all the time.

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.400
Well, they do, all right? They do.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:55.300
And maybe one day, when I start being a
successful actor, I'll be like one of those guys.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.800
But until that day, I ain't got nothing.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.800
I don't have a pot to piss in or a window
to throw it out. All I got is fucking Floyd.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.700
If you want me to help you sell a little
bit at a time, that's all I can do.

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.300
No, no. None of that
little-bit-at-a-time shit.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.200
It's got to be the whole enchilada in one
shot, and that's the way it's gotta be.

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:14.300
Clarence, do you have any idea
how difficult that's gonna be?

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.600
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.800
I'm offering half a million dollars' worth
of white for 200 grand. That's difficult?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.700
Very difficult. That's very
difficult, do you understand?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.500
It's difficult because you're
selling to a particular group.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.100
Fat cats. Big shots. Guys
who can afford $200,000.

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.700
And guys who can use a whole
fucking suitcase full of cocaine.

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.900
Basically, Clarence, guys I don't know.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:40.600
And guys you don't know. And more
importantly, they don't know you.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.700
Come on, Dick.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.300
Okay, Clarence. Listen.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.200
There's one guy that I know
that can help you out, Clarence,

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.300
but... I'm not guaranteeing you anything.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.100
Is he big league?

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:07.800
No. He's not big league. Okay?

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:13.200
But he works as an assistant to a very
big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:16.400
Lee Donowitz could afford and can use...

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.900
$200,000 worth of coke,

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:22.300
- being that that's what you have.
- So what did you tell him?

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.300
What the fuck you expect
me to tell him, huh?

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.800
I didn't know what the hell
was bullshit and what wasn't.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.200
And besides, Floyd smoked the
2nd page of the letter. Okay?

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:35.100
What's this acting class guy's name?

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.900
Elliot.

01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:39.000
Elliot what?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Elliot Blitzer.

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.400
Okay, we'll get him on the phone
and we'll arrange a meeting...

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.900
so we can get through all
this getting-to-know-you stuff.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:52.000
- Where?
- Where should we meet?

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.100
- Roller coaster.
- Roller coasters.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.300
So, you got, uh--you got
$500,000 worth of cola...

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.400
that you're unloading for $200,000.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.000
- You want an animal cracker?
- Um, thanks.

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.000
Wait. Save the gorillas.

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:18.000
Thanks.

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:20.100
That's all right. Anyway, thanks.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:25.000
So, you got--you got
$500,000 worth of cola...

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.500
that you're unloading for $200,000.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.800
"Unloading." That is a hell of a way
to describe the bargain of a lifetime.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:33.200
Where did you get it?

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.800
Where did I get it?

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:37.900
I, uh-- I grow it on my windowsill.

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:41.300
See, the light's really good up there.
I'm up high enough off the street...

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.300
so you can't see it.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.200
- It works perfectly.
- Yeah.

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:49.000
Where, really-- where
does it come from?

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:51.900
- Where does it come from? Coca leaves.
- Yeah.

01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:54.900
- You know what? I'm out of here.
- Elliot, chill out.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.800
Sit down here. All right? We're both here.

01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:02.100
We might as well enjoy the ride. I'll
tell you, okay? But keep it quiet.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.100
If Dick didn't ensure me you're good people,
I'd just tell ya, "None of your fucking business."

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.400
- Okay, okay, okay.
- This is gonna be fun.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.500
Let's go!

01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:13.400
The truth of the matter is,
I got a friend in the department.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.300
What department?

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.900
"What department?" What
do you think, 8 ball?

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:22.200
- The police department?
- Give the man a prize!

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.700
About a year and a half ago, this friend
of mine got access to the evidence room,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.800
and he snagged this coke, but he's
a good cop with a wife and a kid.

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:30.800
So he held on to it for
about a year and a half,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.600
- until he found a guy he could trust.
- And he trusts you?

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:38.500
Yeah. We were in 4-H together. We've known
each other since childhood. I'm handling sales.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.800
He's my silent partner. He knows if I
get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him.

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.600
Okay? Now, no further, you understand?

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:47.600
He's kind of paranoid. I didn't tell
you nothing. You didn't hear nothing.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.600
I didn't hear nothing!

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.700
Here we go!

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.700
Ride it out, baby!

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.100
Yeah!

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:15.400
We're going in for another
one! Hang on, Elliot! Whoo!

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:33.000
Oh, yeah, we got this
puppy. This was a good idea.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.600
Elliot looks a little green.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Elliot, do I look like a
beautiful blond with big tits...

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:53.100
and an ass that tastes like
French vanilla ice cream?

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.200
What?

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:57.800
Do I look like a beautiful
blond with big tits...

01:06:57.900 --> 01:06:59.800
and an ass that tastes like
French vanilla ice cream?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.800
No.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.600
No. Okay, then why are you
telling me all this bullshit, huh?

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:07.200
- What, you wanna fuck me?
- Clarence.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.600
- He's sick.
- Let me handle this, all right?

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:12.500
Look. You know what? Just get it straight.

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:16.800
Lee is not into taking risks, okay?

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:21.300
He's got a couple of guys. He's
been dealing with them for years.

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:24.700
They're reliable, they're
dependable, and they're safe.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.100
Riddle me this, Batman.

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.300
If you're all so much in love with each other,
what the hell are you doing here?

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.300
I'm sure you got better
things to do with your time...

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.300
than hang around upside down
on a roller coaster all day.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:38.700
Your guy is interested because with
that much shit at his fingertips,

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:41.200
he could play Joe-fucking-Hollywood
until the wheels come off.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.500
He can sell it. He can snort it.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.100
He can play Santa Claus with
it as far as I'm concerned.

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.000
At the price he's paying, he's gonna be
able to afford to just throw it around.

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.700
He's gonna be everybody's
best friend, all right?

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.700
I mean, I'm not putting him down here.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.700
It's his money. Let him do
whatever the hell he wants.

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:57.700
But don't expect me and my
friends to hang around forever,

01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:01.600
waiting for you guys to grow some guts.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.100
- Yeah, hello?
- Hi, Lee.

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:11.200
Elliot, it's Sunday. Can you tell
me why I'm talking to you on Sunday?

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.800
I don't see enough of you all week,
I gotta talk to you on Sunday too?

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.800
I'm with that party that you
wanted me to get together with, Lee.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
- You know who I'm talking about?
- I don't believe this.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:23.800
Elliot, why the hell are you
talking to me on my phone about that?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.100
Well, because I'm standing--
I'm standing with the guy,

01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:29.200
and he insists on talking to you.

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.399
Are you out of your fucking mind?

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.300
He said that if I didn't get
you on the phone, he would--

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.600
Hello, Lee. It's Clarence. At last we speak.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:43.100
First of all, Lee,
I'm a really big fan of yours.

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:45.800
That's why I wanna open Dr.Zhivago in L.A.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.899
And I need you and your
abilities to distribute it.

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:51.100
Uh, Clarence. Uh--

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:54.600
I don't know, Clarence.
Dr.Zhivago is a pretty big movie.

01:08:54.899 --> 01:08:57.000
The biggest movie you've
ever dealt with, Lee.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.000
We're talking a lot of film here.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.600
A man would have to be an idiot not to be a
little bit cautious about a movie like that.

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:04.600
And, Lee, you are no idiot.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.100
No, no. I'm not saying I'm
not interested, Clarence.

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.500
Being a distributor is not what I'm all
about. I'm a movie producer, you know?

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.500
I am on this earth to make good movies.

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:15.300
Nothing more and nothing--
well, maybe less sometimes.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.300
Hey!

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.000
Choose a fucking lane!

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.000
No, not you. Just some idiot--
Don't give me the finger!

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.700
I'll fucking have you killed!

01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:29.300
The bottom line is, I am not Paramount.
You know what I'm saying?

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.300
I got a select few distributors I deal with.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.100
I buy their little movies, and I
accomplish what I wanna accomplish...

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.200
and get the fuck out of there.

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:38.500
Very businesslike, very easy
and very little risk, Clarence.

01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:42.000
Lee, we're talking Dr.Zhivago. This will
be packing 'em in for a year and a half.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.100
2 years. That is 2 years
you're not gonna have to deal...

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.100
with anybody else's movie but mine.

01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:49.300
Nobody's but yours. Well,
what is the rush here?

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:52.399
I just wanna be able to
announce this deal at Cannes.

01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:56.500
If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would.
I'd take ya out, hold your hand, kiss your cheek.

01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:58.500
But I'm not in that position.

01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:01.800
I need to know right now if you
and I are in bed together or not.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.600
If you want my movie, you're gonna have
to come to terms with your fear and desire.

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:09.300
Uh-huh. Fear and desire, huh, Clarence?

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.800
Don't you know that my films have
grossed more than 2.8 billion, Clarence?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.700
- Let me talk to Elliot. Let me talk to Elliot.
- You wanna talk to Elliot?

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:21.500
Elliot, he wants to talk to you.

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:26.800
- Hi, Lee.
- Elliot, where do you know this guy from?

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:29.700
He's, uh-- He's a friend of Dick's, remember?

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:31.700
Who the fuck is Dick?

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:37.700
You-- You--
You want me to... suck his dick?

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.700
- No. Who the fuck is Dick?
- Oh, who the fuck is Dick?

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.600
- Yeah.
- Dick is my friend. He's in my acting class.

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:48.000
- You told him I'm an actor?
- Is he any good? Is he talented?

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.900
Really? How does Dick know this guy?

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:54.000
- Tell him--
- They--They grew up together.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.600
Okay, uh, Wednesday at the hotel, 3:00.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.600
Bring the whole fucking cast, all right?

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:03.600
Elliot, don't call me here anymore,
especially not on Sunday, all right?

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:06.200
- What did he say?
- Just hold on a second.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.700
- Did you tell him--
- Shut up for a second. Hey, you guys.

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:10.700
This is what's gonna happen.

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:14.500
3:00, Beverly Ambassador. He
wants to see everybody. Okay?

01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:18.200
And he'll talk to you. If after
talking to you he likes you,

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.400
wants to deal with you, he'll deal with you.

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:23.500
If he doesn't, he'll say fuck you,
and he'll walk out of the room.

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.600
- Did you tell him--
- Shut up for a second.

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.800
And he wants a sample bag.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.400
- No problem on all counts.
- Great.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.800
Did you tell him I was an actor?

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.800
- Yes, I told him.
- You told him I was good?

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.000
Yeah, I lied.

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:55.400
- Hi.
- How you doing?

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.200
- Oh, pretty good.
- You Dick? Dick Ritchie?

01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:00.800
No. No, he's not here right now.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.100
- You live here?
- Yes, I do.

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.600
You're sort of, uh, roommates?

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.600
Exactly roommates.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.100
Maybe you can help me. I'm
looking for a friend of mine.

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.100
- Sure.
- Clarence Worley from Detroit?

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:18.700
- He's traveling with a real pretty girl named Alabama?
- Oh, yeah, man, I know 'em.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.700
- They've been by here.
- You've seen 'em?

01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:22.700
- Mm-hmm.
- They staying here?

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:25.000
No, they're staying at the...

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:27.700
Safari Motor-- Motel Inn.

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:31.000
- Safari Motel.
- Safari Motel?

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.500
Yeah.

01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.800
How do you know that?
Have you been over there?

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:38.200
No. They were here,

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:42.300
and they said that they
were going to go there.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.500
Then they went.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:47.400
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Safari-- Safari Motel.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:48.900
Safari Motel.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.800
Hey, you wanna watch some
TV? They might be back here.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.200
- No. No, thank you. Thank you, though.
- Okay.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.400
- You take care. I might be back.
- Yeah.

01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:00.400
Good. Be cool.

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:05.800
Don't condescend to me, man.

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:08.800
I'll fucking kill you, man.

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:18.300
I'm so proud of you. Did I do my part okay?

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:21.500
- Alabama, you were perfect.
- Like a ninja?

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.600
Like a ninja. I'm gonna go
grab us something to eat.

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:28.600
I'm gonna go jump in the tub and
get all wet and slippery and soapy...

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:31.700
and hop in that water bed
and watch X-rated movies...

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.100
till you get your ass
back in my lovin' arms.

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.900
Hurry back now.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:49.400
We now return to Bullitt,
already in progress.

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:57.200
You give your love

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.900
So sweetly

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:02.000
Hi.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.100
Hi!

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.200
Hi.

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.600
- Cigarette?
- No.

01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:24.500
That's a very nice outfit.

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.900
Oh. This?

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.400
I got this in Las Vegas, Nevada.

01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:46.200
Alabama, where's our coke,
and, uh, where's Clarence?

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:49.100
When's he coming back?

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:51.200
I'm sorry. I think you have the wrong room.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.600
My name is Sadie.

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:59.300
We don't have any Coke, but there's
a Pepsi machine down the hall.

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.800
I don't know anybody named Clarence,
but perhaps my husband does.

01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:05.500
You can ask him,
'cause he'll be home in a minute.

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.700
He plays football.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.800
He's just at practice.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:24.000
- Give me your hand.
- Okay.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.200
You are unbelievably cute.

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:35.800
Thank you. Thanks.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.300
Let me see those eyes.

01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:44.800
What a face.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.500
Do me a favor. Turn around for me.

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.500
Okay.

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:53.500
No, go the other way.

01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:56.300
Okay.

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.900
Ooh. That hurts, don't it?

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.900
Get on your feet, sweetie.
You ain't hurt that bad.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:25.700
Now, where's our coke? Where's Clarence?
And when's he coming back?

01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:28.800
Okay. Okay.

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:33.400
Fuck you.

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:38.300
Fuck me.

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.700
What's the matter, baby, huh?

01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:49.500
Can't breathe?

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:56.000
You better get used to that.

01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:59.600
- Mmm. Smells like hamburgers in here.
- Hi.

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:02.500
Tell me, what is the biggest,
fattest hamburger you guys got?

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:05.100
That would be Steve's
double chili cheeseburger.

01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:07.200
Give me 2 of them bad boys, 2 chili fries

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:12.300
- and, uh, 2 large Diet Cokes.
- Anything else?

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:18.700
Come here. Look at yourself!
Look! Take a good look!

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.900
You think your boyfriend would go for this
shit? If you do, you're fucking stupid.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.900
You're a very pretty girl, but you
ain't gonna be very pretty for very long.

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:29.200
I'm gonna ask you a fucking question,

01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:32.200
and you give me the right fucking answer!

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.400
Now,

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.600
where's my coke?

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:45.100
Turn around. Turn around.

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:47.200
Answer me!

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.600
Come on.

01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:00.100
You got a lot of heart, kid.

01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:05.000
Now, that is a great issue.

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:08.700
You gotten to the story on Elvis yet?

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:11.500
No, I hadn't.

01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:14.000
That is probably the single best piece
I have ever read on Elvis Presley...

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:16.800
in my entire life.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.300
Look. It tries to pin down what the
attraction is after all these years.

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.500
It covers the whole spectrum.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:27.300
Talks to the fans, people who grew up
with him, people who love his music.

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:30.400
Then there's the fanatics. Right?

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:34.300
I don't know about you,
but they give me the creeps.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:37.400
- Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean.
- I mean, look at her.

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:41.300
It looks like she fell off the ugly tree
and hit every branch on the way down.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.400
Now, the first time you kill
somebody, that's the hardest.

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:57.800
I don't give a shit if you're
fucking wired up or Jack the Ripper.

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:07.900
Remember that guy in Texas? The guy in
that fucking tower, killed all them people?

01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:12.900
I bet you green money, that first
little black dot he took a bead on,

01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:15.500
that was the bitch of the bunch.

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:19.600
1st one is tough. No fucking fooling.

01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:22.800
The 2nd one ain't no
fucking Mardi Gras either,

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.100
but it's better than the 1st, 'cause you
still feel the same thing, except it's diluted.

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:31.300
You know, it's-- it's better.

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.700
I threw up on the 1st one. You believe that?

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.000
Then the 3rd one--

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:40.000
The 3rd one is easy. You level right off.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:45.100
That's no problem. Now--

01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:47.200
Shit.

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:50.600
Now I do it just to watch
their fucking expression change.

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.000
I don't fucking believe it.

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.800
Did you put it under the bed?

01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:11.900
I can't believe it. You put
it under the fucking bed.

01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:14.700
I didn't look under the fucking bed.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.300
I can't believe you put
it under the fuckin' bed,

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.900
and I can't believe I didn't
look under the fuckin' bed.

01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:26.100
I'm gettin' fuckin' old.

01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:28.400
Journey's end, baby.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:31.100
Snow at the end of the rainbow.

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:36.100
One less thing I gotta fuckin' worry about.

01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:47.900
This is it, baby.

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:50.500
Moment of truth.

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.300
You got a lot of heart, kid. You know that?

01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:06.500
Wanna play?

01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:10.000
Is that what you want?

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.500
You wanna play with Daddy?

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:15.700
Come on. Come on. I'll give
you one shot 'cause I like you.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Stick it in me, baby.
Come on. Stick it in Daddy.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:22.300
Stick it in me. Go ahead.

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.200
Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.400
Motherfucker!

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:50.200
- All right. No more Mr. Fuckin' Nice Guy.
- Oh, God.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.800
What do you think of that, baby?

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.700
What do you think about that?
What do you think about that?

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.600
Wait! Wait!

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:05.800
What?

01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:10.100
- Hey, what the fuck are you laughing at?
- You look ridiculous!

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:18.000
Come here! I look fuckin'
ridiculous? Get up! Laugh it up!

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:22.100
Come on, laugh it up! You were
in hysterics a minute ago! Laugh!

01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:24.700
- You like that, don't you?
- Fuck you!

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.600
Shit! Fuck!

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:30.500
Fuck! Come on. We gotta
go. Baby, we gotta go.

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.600
Jesus Christ!

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.900
Come on, darlin'. We gotta
get the fuck out of here.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.100
Come on.

01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:39.500
Come on. The cops are gonna
be here any fuckin' second.

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.100
Fuck!

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.300
Fuck! Come on.

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:45.900
Fuck. Come on. I'm sorry.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.500
Fuck! Fuck!

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:04.600
I'm sorry. Oh, fuck!

01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:06.600
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:09.500
Get the fuck out of the way!

01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:12.900
Those eyes, those thighs They're part

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.900
Oh, fuck!

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:24.900
- Fuck!
- What?

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.600
I don't fuckin' believe this!
Goddamn it! I fucking knew it!

01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:44.600
I should have my goddamn head
examined for driving like this.

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:48.900
Look, Carla-- Kandi,
you've gotta help me.

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:51.600
- What can I do?
- Take this. Hold this.

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.500
- What, are you high? No.
- Fucking put this in your purse.

01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:57.000
- I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
- He's not gonna search you.

01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:59.400
You didn't do anything.
Just put it in your bra.

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:04.400
- I'm not wearing one.
- Please! He's almost here! Just put it in your pants!

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:08.300
- No.
- You are the one that wanted to drive fast.

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.100
Read my lips. No!

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:15.100
- After all I did for you, you fucking whore.
- Asshole.

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.500
Who the fuck do you think you're--

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:24.400
Hi.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Look, dick-head, it's your bad
luck that we caught you speeding,

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.800
and it's your bad luck that
you had a bag of uncut cocaine.

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:33.800
- Not a tiny little vial.
- A fuckin' baggy.

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:37.300
Hey, you got caught. It's all fun
and fuckin' games till you get caught.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:41.100
But now we got you, okay, Mr. Elliot
Fuckin' Actor. You just made the big time.

01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:43.600
- You're no longer an extra.
- Or a bit player.

01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:45.600
- Or a supporting actor.
- You're a fuckin' star.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.000
You're a fucking star, and you're gonna
be playing your one-man show nightly...

01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:53.100
for the next 2 fuckin'
years for a captive audience!

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:55.900
Listen to this. You get out in
a few years, meet some old lady,

01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:58.800
you'll get married, and you'll be so
understanding to your wife's needs...

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.200
because you'll know what
it feels like to be a woman.

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:05.200
You'll only want to fuck her in the ass because
that pussy won't be tight enough anymore.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:08.800
Good point, Detective.
Right? Fuckin' faggot.

01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:11.600
Krinkle, this is it. We
got it, and it's all ours.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.600
- You talk about fallin' into something.
- We got it.

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:16.400
Will both you idiots shut
up? I can't understand shit.

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.600
What happened? What are you talking about?

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:23.900
Okay. A patrol car pulls a guy over for
speedin', right? Suspect's covered with coke.

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:26.300
They bring the suspect to me and
Nicholson, and we go to work on him.

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:30.200
- "Nicholson and I."
- What's the fuckin' difference?

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:33.200
So we go to work on the guy, and we
know something's rotten in Denmark,

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:36.800
'cause this guy's fuckin' stupid, and
he's got a big bag of coke and it's uncut.

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:40.300
And you ain't gonna fuckin'
believe what he's got to say.

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:43.700
Seems a cop from some department--
we don't know which one--

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:46.100
stole a half a million dollars
of coke from the property cage.

01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:48.300
Had been sittin' on the
shit for a year and a half.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:51.800
- The cops got this weirdo who's a front for him.
- Suspect's words.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.400
Our guy, Elliot Blitzer, he's making
a deal between them and his boss,

01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:58.800
a big-time fuckin' movie
producer named Lee Donowitz.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.400
He did the movie Coming Home in a Body Bag.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.000
- A Vietnam movie? Good fuckin' movie.
- Yeah.

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.500
- Fuckin' "A."
- Great fuckin' movie.

01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:09.400
- So, you believe him?
- I believe he believes him.

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:12.000
This guy's too fuckin' rattled
to be lyin'. He'd roll over...

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:16.200
on his mommy, daddy, 2-pantied granny and
the King of Siam if he had anything on them.

01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:21.000
This guy was a sissy. This rabbit
will do anything not to do any time.

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.800
You know what he'll do? He'll wear a wire.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.100
- He'll wear a wire?
- He'll wear a wire. We talked to him.

01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:32.200
Dirty cops. We gotta get
Internal Affairs on this.

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.100
I don't give a shit who you bring in.
You can bring in the militia, L.A. Thunderbirds,

01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:37.800
the ghost of Steve fuckin' McQueen,
10 fuckin' Roman gladiators.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.700
I don't give a shit as long as me
and Todd get credit for the bust.

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:44.200
Listen, we found him. We
just want the fuckin' collar.

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:46.200
That's it. End of story.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:49.900
- You got it.
- Fuckin' "A."

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:57.400
Have I ever told you how much I hate airports?

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:02.800
See, I used to live by one
back in Dearborn, you know?

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.900
Really frustrating living next to
an airport when you ain't got shit.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:13.500
All day long I'm seeing
and hearing people...

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:16.400
doing exactly what I wanna
be doing but couldn't.

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:19.000
What?

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:22.300
Starting new lives, leaving Detroit.

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:24.400
Vacations, business trips.

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.400
Fun, fun, fun.

01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:27.800
You all right?

01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:36.200
You and me, we can jump on any one of those
planes out there and go anywhere we want.

01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:39.800
It gives me a whole new
outlook. Love airports now.

01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:42.500
Yeah, you ain't kiddin'. We
got our lives to start over.

01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:45.300
We should go somewhere where we
can really start from scratch.

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:48.600
I've been in America all my life.

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:51.500
I've always wanted to see what
TV in other countries looks like.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:55.000
Where do you think we should
go, my little turtle dove?

01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:58.900
Cancun.

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:01.200
Cancun? Why Cancun?

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:04.900
It's got a nice ring to
it. It sounds like a movie.

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:08.300
Clarence and Alabama Go
to Cancun. Don't you think?

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:12.900
In my movie, darling, you get top billing.

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:17.000
Don't you worry about nothin', all right?

01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:19.900
It's all gonna work out for us.

01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:21.900
We deserve it.

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:36.400
Floyd, you're sure that's how
you get to the Beverly Ambassador?

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:39.600
Yeah, man, I'm positive.

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:42.800
- Yeah, well, if we get lost, that's your ass.
- Clarence--

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.100
- Why don't you get out of my beer and get a fuckin' job?
- Yeah, okay.

01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:47.700
- Can we go?
- We're out the door.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:50.100
I gotta meet Elliot in the
lobby. I don't want to be late.

01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:53.700
I just want to make sure
we got everything. Let's go.

01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:57.700
- Yes?
- I'm out. I'm out, Floyd.

01:29:57.700 --> 01:29:59.600
- Are you here? No, he's not here.
- I'm out.

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:02.300
- Wait, wait. Let me get this.
- Come on!

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:05.300
- Okay, I-- Fuck!
- Hello?

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.800
Hi, Catherine. I was just walkin' out--

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:10.900
- What?
- Do you know what time it is?

01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:14.300
Serious? She said that?

01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:16.200
What'd she say? Come on.

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:20.700
- Yo, Catherine, thank you. Thank you.
- Ask him what time it is.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.900
- You got the time?
- I'm gonna talk to you tomorrow.

01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:25.200
- Hey, man, can you get me some food?
- All right.

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:28.500
Come on. We gotta go. Come on.

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.500
I got the part.

01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:33.000
- Wow!
- I got the part!

01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:36.000
- That's great, man.
- That's great. That's wonderful.

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:38.200
They didn't even want a callback.

01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:40.900
I can't believe it. That's great.

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.700
That's so cool. Way to go.

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.800
- I got a 7:00 call.
- That's great.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.500
Come on, let's go. I want to hear
all about it in the car, okay? Come on.

01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:53.700
- Hey, Clarence.
- What?

01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:57.300
Nothin'.

01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.900
- Forget it.
- All right. Come on.

01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:02.400
Come on!

01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:05.400
Hey, get some-- get some beer...

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.000
and some--

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
and some cleaning products.

01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:13.600
<i>His legacy lives on.</i>

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.900
<i>That was Bob Henderson with a touchdown.</i>

01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:23.300
I'm losin' a fuckin' fortune over here.

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:32.700
You talkin' to me, you fuckin' wop, you?

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:34.800
Fuckin'--

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.000
You're okay.

01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:58.300
- Put your jacket on.
- Put your jacket on.

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:00.400
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:04.400
Put your jacket on. One sleeve at a time.

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.800
It's a big game now, Elliot.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.900
- It's okay. Come on. You all right?
- No.

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:12.200
Elliot, look at me.

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:14.300
Look at me. You comfortable?

01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:17.100
Am I comfortable? I've got a,

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:20.800
like, you know, brick in... my scrotum.

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:24.300
That's the best place for it. If they pat you
down, they're not gonna search your balls.

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:27.500
- Okay. You think they might see this, perhaps?
- No, it's okay.

01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:30.000
- When you stand up, it'll be okay. Elliot.
- Okay. Yeah.

01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:32.700
Elliot, say something.

01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:35.500
- Just--
- Okay. Hi. How are you?

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:38.400
My name's Elliot, and I'm
with the Cub Scouts of America.

01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:43.700
We're selling uncut cocaine
to get to the jamboree.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.600
- Just talk regular.
- Stop fuckin' around.

01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:51.100
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- You get that shit?

01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:54.400
We're gonna be right down the hall,
monitoring you the whole time.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:57.000
What happens if somebody
does something you can't hear,

01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:59.500
like pulls out a gun and
puts it to my fucking eye?

01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:01.700
We've done this a thousand times.

01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:04.400
We know what we're doing,
okay? We're the best.

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:06.400
Now, listen. No fuckin' around.

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:09.200
Anything happens, we'll be in
there like fuckin' gangbusters.

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:13.100
You gotta remember something. You don't
wanna go to jail. Do you wanna go to jail?

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.300
No, I don't wanna go to jail.

01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:18.700
So what do we gotta do? We gotta
put your boss in jail, okay?

01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:21.700
And to do that,
we've got to show in court,

01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:24.400
beyond a reasonable doubt, that this man,

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:27.400
a very respectable man in the Hollywood
community, is also dealing cocaine.

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.700
We've got to prove it in court,
and you've gotta do it.

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:31.000
That's what we're doing here.

01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:33.700
Okay? You're gonna be okay.
You're not gonna get hurt.

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:37.100
So what you've gotta do--
you've gotta get him to admit...

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:38.700
on tape, all right?

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:41.700
That he's buyin' this coke. Okay, champ?

01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:44.600
- Get ahold of yourself. You'll be okay.
- Okay.

01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:46.900
I'm gonna get some coffee.

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:52.400
You really got that playin' basketball?

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:54.500
Yep, I got elbowed right in the eye.

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:58.800
Then, as it that's not enough, I got hurled
the ball right when I'm not lookin'. Wham!

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.800
- Right in my face.
- You should be careful.

01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:05.000
I should.

01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:19.600
Clarence, what the fuck
did you bring that for?

01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:22.400
- In case.
- In case of what?

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:25.100
I don't know. What the
hell do you want me to say?

01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:28.200
Look, Clarence, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp.

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:31.200
I know that. But one thing
this last week has taught me,

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:35.300
it's better to have a gun and not need
it than to need a gun and not have it.

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:38.500
Paging Mr.Sherek.

01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:40.700
- Sherek.
- He's over at the bar.

01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:43.000
There he is.

01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:55.700
Elliot, your motivation
is to stay out of jail.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.700
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Hey.

01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:02.900
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:05.200
I guess it's about that time, huh?

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.700
Yeah.

01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:09.600
Here we go.

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:20.800
You're an actor. Act, motherfucker.

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.200
- Elliot?
- Yeah?

01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:33.000
- Get on your knees.
- Oh, no.

01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:37.000
- What?
- I said, get on your fuckin' knees!

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:40.100
Shut the fuck up! I know
what the fuck I'm doin'.

01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:43.100
- You think I'm pretty fuckin' stupid, don't you?
- No.

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:45.700
Don't you fuckin' lie
to me, you motherfucker!

01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:48.800
He's bluffing you,
Elliot! Can't you see that?

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000
I want to hear you say,
"Clarence, you are--"

01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:54.800
Shut up! Say it, goddamn
it! I wanna hear you say it!

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.700
"Clarence, you are without a doubt,
the dumbest motherfucker I've ever seen!"

01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:02.600
- Say it!
- Dumb fucker!

01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:05.600
- Apparently, I'm not as dumb-- Shut up!
- He didn't do nothin'!

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:08.000
Apparently, I'm not as dumb as
you fuckin' think I am, am I?

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:10.300
- No.
- What the fuck is waiting for us up there?

01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:13.600
- What the fuck's waiting for us?
- He's gonna shoot him.

01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:16.100
Tell me, or I'm gonna pump
2 in your face right here.

01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:18.800
He's not gonna shoot him.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.200
- Motherfuck--
- He's gonna shoot him.

01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:25.500
Like Nick Curry used to say, if I'm wrong,
I swear to God I'll fucking apologize!

01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:29.200
Something's amiss. I can feel it.
If anything out of the ordinary goes down,

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:31.100
you are gonna be the first one shot.

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:33.700
- He didn't do anything! What the fuck--
- Shut up!

01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:35.700
I'm gonna blow this
motherfucker away. Fuck you!

01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:39.000
I wish somebody would
just come and get me,

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:40.900
because I don't like this anymore!

01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:43.100
Get ahold of yourself, you fuckin' sissy!

01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:47.800
I really wish somebody would just come
and take me away! Just take me away!

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Hang in there, will you? Goddamn it!

01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:54.300
I can't take this! I'm sorry,
but I just can't! I wish somebody...

01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.300
would just come to my rescue,
and everything would be all right!

01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.700
Elliot? Elliot?

01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:03.800
- What?
- I'm sorry, all right?

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Friends?

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.800
I'm sorry.

01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:14.300
- What's with this guy?
- Quit playing around.

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.300
I wasn't playing around.
I just had to be sure.

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:19.300
That's all. I'm sure now, okay?

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:22.200
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:24.200
Oh, man!

01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:27.100
I like this Clarence kid.
This fuckin' guy's crazy.

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:39.100
Yeah.

01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:48.300
<i>I got up feelin' so down</i>

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:54.300
- Oh, man.
- I got off bein' sold out

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:58.600
- Are you Dick Ritchie?
- Uh, no.

01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:02.700
- But the story's getting old now
- Do you know a Clarence Worley?

01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:05.600
- Yes.
- Do you know where we can find him?

01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:09.800
- Yes, I do. Oh.
- I just looked in the mirror

01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:12.300
Well, where?

01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:15.500
At the Beverly Ambassador.

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:19.000
- Where's that?
- Well,

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:21.200
you go--

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:23.700
No. Yeah. Go down--
Go down Beach--

01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:26.800
You guys want to smoke a bowl or--

01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:31.100
Oh. Go down Beachwood and drive a while,

01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:34.300
and then you're gonna turn right, okay?

01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:38.300
And then you go, and you keep drivin',
and you keep drivin'.

01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:47.500
- Hello, Elliot.
- Monty.

01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:49.900
Are these your friends?

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.500
Yeah. Yeah.

01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:55.000
You could say that.
Everybody, this is Monty.

01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:59.700
Hi. Come on in. Lee's in the
can. He'll be out in a quick.

01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:04.900
Holy shit. Look at this.
Do you believe this?

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.700
- It's a helicopter.
- Sorry. Nothing personal.

01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:11.300
Clarence.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.800
There ain't gonna be a need to search me.
All you're gonna find is this right here.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.900
What compelled you to bring that along?

01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:22.000
I guess the same thing
that compelled you guys...

01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:25.100
to bring heavy artillery
to a business meeting.

01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:28.100
- I'll take that.
- Well, you're gonna have to.

01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:31.100
Oh, hi.

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:35.100
Everybody's here. Elliot, who's who?

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.900
Uh, that's Dick on the end there.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.700
Oh, that's Dick! Elliot
tells me you're quite gifted.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.800
And, uh, Alabama in the middle.

01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:49.100
- Hello.
- Clarence on the end.

01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:52.200
- Lee, this guy is--
- Boris, please. I'm meeting people right now.

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:56.400
- Mr.Donowitz?
- Come on, Clarence. Don't insult me. Call me Lee.

01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:58.700
- Lee?
- Boris, shut the fuck up.

01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:01.000
Come on, everybody.
Don't be shy. Come on in.

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:03.100
Okay, uh, Lee.

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:04.800
- Lee.
- Lee.

01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:08.500
- That's right, Lee.
- I gotta tell you, I really am a big fan.

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:11.200
Coming Home in a Body Bag is
my favorite movie of all time.

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:14.800
After Apocalypse Now, I think that
is the best Vietnam movie ever made.

01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:17.300
- Wow. Thank you very much, Clarence.
- Lee.

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:19.700
- What?
- This guy's packin'.

01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:22.100
Really?

01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:25.000
Well, I've been pretty
scared about this whole thing.

01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:30.000
But I'm fairly confident you're just here to
do business. I don't want to be a wise guy.

01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:32.500
If you want, I'll take my
gun out, lay it on the table.

01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:35.100
It's up to you.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.100
Mm, no, I don't think that's
necessary. Boris, be nice.

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.400
Make everybody some coffee, okay?

01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:45.000
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:47.600
Honey, sit down. Relax. Relax.

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:50.800
- Elliot, you look like shit.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.200
I mean, it's completely disgusting.

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:56.800
Um, I need to get a quick
signature. It would be great--

01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:01.300
- Whatever Bonnie wants.
- Okay.

01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:03.500
- Like my dailies there, Clar?

01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:06.300
- Is that what these are? Yeah, they're great.
- You like 'em?

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:08.500
Better fuckin' be great.
They cost me enough.

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:11.800
- What'd that day cost me?
- $357,000.

01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:15.400
Elliot, I swear to God,
somebody is stealing from me.

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:18.000
What's this one called anyway?

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:21.500
- It's a sequel to Body Bag.
- Really?

01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:23.900
We don't have a title
yet. What does Joe like?

01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:27.300
Uh, Body Bags II.

01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:31.200
Ooh, that's imaginative. I've
got more taste in my penis.

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:34.900
This guy's really fuckin' funny.

01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:38.200
You know, most of these movies that
win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand them.

01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:41.200
They're all safe, geriatric
coffee-table dogshit.

01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:44.500
We park our cars in the
same garage. It's all right.

01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:47.800
All those assholes make are unwatchable
movies from unreadable books.

01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:51.700
Mad Max, that's a movie. The Good,
the Bad and the Ugly, that's a movie.

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:56.000
Rio Bravo, that's a movie. And Coming Home
in a Body Bag, that was a fuckin' movie.

01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:59.100
It was the only movie up to that time
that won a lot of Oscars with balls.

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:02.600
- I mean, since Deer Hunter.
- I don't believe you.

01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:07.900
Do you like a little coffee
with your sugar, or what?

01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:10.400
Lee, I'm not satisfied till
the spoon stands straight up.

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:13.400
Give me a coffee, will you?

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:19.300
My Uncle Roger and Uncle Jerry, both of whom
were in 'Nam, saw Coming Home in a Body Bag.

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:23.900
They said to me, Clarence, that is the most
accurate Vietnam film they'd ever seen.

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:27.300
When veterans in that bullshit
war say that about my project,

01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:29.600
it makes the whole thing worthwhile.

01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:31.600
Here's to you.

01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:34.800
My friend-- I'm calling you my
friend. I just met you. You know why?

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.100
I think 'cause we got the same interests.

01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:41.700
You know what I'd like to do right now?
I'd like to see Dr.Zhivago.

01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:44.400
Where is it?

01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:47.000
Is there a fucking doctor
in the house, or what?

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:49.700
Hang on a second. Lee, when you
see this, you are gonna shit.

01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:51.700
- I better.
- Bingo.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.200
- What's the guy's name?
- Donowitz.

01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:05.800
When somebody loves you

01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:10.300
It's no good unless you love them

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.700
Uh, Lee, that is all practically uncut.

01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:17.500
If you so desire, you can
cut that a hell of a lot more.

01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:20.800
Don't worry. I'll desire. Boris,
get me another cup of coffee, will you?

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.000
- Me too, Boris.
- I have to hand it to you, this is not nose garbage.

01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:27.400
It's quality stuff.

01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.700
Perfect merchandise.

01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:33.700
The only trouble is, whenever I'm
offered a deal that's too good to be true,

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.300
it's because it's a lie.

01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:40.200
Jesus, what's going on?

01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:47.300
- Why don't you convince me you're on the level?
- Convince him.

01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:49.600
If he don't bite, we ain't
got shit except possession.

01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:53.200
Boris, we got all kinds of sandwich shit
back there. Make something for somebody.

01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.400
We got lean pastrami, nice
rye. Anybody want anything?

01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:00.000
- You got any aspirin?
- Yeah, sure. Get him that.

01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:02.800
Well, uh, Lee, it's like this.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:06.700
You're getting the bargain of a lifetime
because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:10.700
You're used to dealing with professionals,
and I'm not. I'm a rank amateur.

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:14.400
What the fuck's goin' on?
What the fuck's goin' on?

01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:19.300
I can take that and sell it a little
bit at a time. Make a lot more money.

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:22.400
- What's going on, Joe?
- Elliot's too far away.

01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:25.400
- This is the whole ball game. The game is set!
- He's too far away!

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:27.700
I'm not a drug dealer. I'm not
saying you're a drug dealer.

01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:32.100
But you're a movie producer. You got access
to all kinds of money and shit like that.

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:34.600
Shit!

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:38.700
- Joe, you are fuckin' killing me. Joe--
- Wait, wait. Wait.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.400
I cannot get a million for it, but you can.

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.900
All right? So I'll sell
it to you for 200,000.

01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:45.900
You go make a million with it.

01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:49.600
Shit, it's all found money
to me anyway, you know?

01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:51.500
There he is.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.200
Me- Me and my wife,
we're minimum-wage kids.

01:44:57.300 --> 01:45:01.200
$200,000, that means the world to us.

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:05.200
Elliot tells me that you're
fronting for a dirty cop.

01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:08.500
Uh, Elliot wasn't supposed
to tell you anything.

01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:11.200
He's not a dirty cop. He's a good cop.

01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.600
He saw his chance, and
he took it, that's all.

01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:15.900
Why does he trust you?

01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:18.800
Well, we grew up together, that's why.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Clarence, if you don't know shit,

01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:24.400
then why does he think that you can sell it?

01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:28.000
I bullshitted him.

01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:33.600
You are nuts!

01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:36.700
He's a wild man, this
kid Clarence. I like him.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.200
- You're wild! I love you! I love this guy.
- Hey, Lee.

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:43.000
He bullshitted him. You
believe this kid? I love him.

01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:45.600
<i>Elliot, I love this kid.
Monty, get the money.</i>

01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:48.100
That's it, fellas. Let's
get these sons of bitches.

01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:51.700
Now, wait, wait.

01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:54.300
I forgot. Excuse me. What
is your part in this again?

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:57.800
- I'm his wife.
- Oh, you're the wife! Right.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.400
Clarence, what, did you
beat her or something?

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.700
No, no. She got that playing basketball.

01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:07.100
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm sorry.

01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:10.000
- Why are you here?
- I'm an actor.

01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:13.900
Dick, if you were just a fuckin' actor,
you never would've got in the room.

01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:16.700
I'm-- I'm friends with Elliot.

01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:19.200
He's your friend? You got problems.

01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:22.300
All right, all right. It's
all right. And Elliot knows me.

01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:25.100
- Elliot, here. Call Joe.
- Sorry.

01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:27.200
Tell that cocksucker the
production manager reports...

01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:30.500
that he's taking 30 cents of every
dollar and putting it in his own pocket.

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:34.200
Don't you want to count your money?

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:37.200
No, that's all right. She can count
it. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:39.400
Give it to her.

01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:43.600
Well, since my baby left me

01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:45.600
I found a new place to dwell

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:48.700
It's down at the end of Lonely Street

01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:51.400
The Heartbreak Hotel

01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:53.900
- I gotta hand it to you, Clarence.
- I was cool?

01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:56.000
Man, you were cooler than cool.

01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:58.300
Oh, my God. I forgot my fuckin' vest.

01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:00.300
- Stupid.
- Cody, on 3.

01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:04.100
- Yeah.
- 1, 2, 3

01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:18.400
Both of you, put the fucking
guns on the floor now!

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:22.100
Fuck you! All you pigs, put your
guns on the floor and back away.

01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:25.300
- Are you fucking nuts? Just do what they say.
- This is your last chance!

01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:29.400
Fuck you! This is your last chance!
We could kill all of you and you know it!

01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:33.200
- Get down on the fucking floor!
- Boris, shut the fuck up.

01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:37.000
- We're all gonna die here. These are cops.
- So? Who gives a shit?

01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:40.700
Something I never told you
about me. I hate fucking cops!

01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:43.600
Let's be nice, guys. Come on.
Let's be nice. We don't want to die.

01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:45.600
We don't want any of you guys to die.

01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:48.900
You look like a blond Frankenstein.
Now put your gun down!

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.400
- 211?
- Yeah, 211.

01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:57.300
There you go, Mad Dog.

01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:09.800
- Holy shit. Motherfucker.
- What the fuck is goin' on?

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.100
- Who are these guys? Put 'em down!
- Put your fuckin' guns down!

01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:16.500
Put 'em down, motherfucker! Put 'em down!

01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:18.800
Fuck you!

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.900
Put those fuckin' guns down!

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.300
How you really think
I'm doin' with Lee, huh?

01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:28.400
- You kidding? He loves you.
- You don't think I'm kissing his ass or anything, do you?

01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:32.500
You're telling him what he wants to hear.
That ain't the same thing as kissing his ass.

01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:36.700
Yeah, I saw Coming Home in a Body Bag.
I loved it. I'm not lyin' to the guy.

01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:39.300
No. That's why it ain't ass-kissin'.

01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:44.100
What you're doin' is
genuine, and he knows it.

01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:48.700
I like you, Clarence.

01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:52.300
Always have. Always will.

01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:04.500
Put 'em down! Put 'em down, motherfuckers!

01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:08.800
Officer Dimes. Officer Dimes.

01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:11.200
Put 'em down, motherfucker!
Put 'em down!

01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:14.200
- Officer Dimes?
- What?

01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:18.300
- Officer Dimes? Officer Dimes?
- What?

01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:21.800
Um, this has nothing to
do with me anymore, right?

01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:24.900
Okay? So I'm just gonna leave,

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.100
and you guys just settle
this by yourselves, all right?

01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:29.200
Just shut up and stay the fuck put, Elliot.

01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:32.000
How do you know his name?

01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:34.700
Why the fuck did he know your name?

01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:37.800
You little piece of shit!

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.700
You can forget about acting for the next
20 years! Your fuckin' career is over!

01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:44.300
Take you fuckin' SAG card and burn it!

01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:47.000
You little cocksucker!

01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:51.000
I treated you like a son,
and you fuckin' stab me in the heart!

01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:53.600
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:56.300
Mother-- Watch it, motherfucker!

01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:05.800
Cody!

01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:14.500
Son of a--

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:33.300
Clarence!

01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:15.900
Sweetie! Sweetie!

01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:21.200
Baby!

01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:25.300
Okay, you with the shotgun
behind the couch, come out!

01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:27.400
Guy's a wop.

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:31.600
I said come out from behind the
couch, you fuckin' guinea, now!

01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:38.100
I said-a come out from-a behind
the couch-o, okay? Capisce?

01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:43.000
Nice and slow.

01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:55.700
Shit! The guy hit me.

01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:07.300
Son of a bitch shot me.

01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:10.700
Sweetie!

01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:15.200
Don't you die on me!

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:20.300
You're gonna be okay.

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:22.300
I need an ambulance!

01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:27.200
I need an ambulance!

01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:39.800
Fuck you!

01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:43.300
I'll blow this bitch's brains
to kingdom come!

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.800
I need an ambulance!

01:52:48.900 --> 01:52:51.300
Shut up!

01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:53.500
Fuck you! I'm bleeding!

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.600
I'll call you a hearse.

01:52:57.500 --> 01:52:58.800
This is for Cody.

01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:03.200
Fuck you!

01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:52.800
Honey, you're alive!

01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:55.400
Honey!

01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:57.600
I can't see.

01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:02.500
Honey, you have blood in your eye.

01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:04.600
Come on.

01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:07.000
All right. Okay.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.100
Fuck you!

01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:13.700
I want a car to take me to the
airport and a plane full of gas!

01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:23.700
And a million bucks!
Small bills! And--

01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:32.500
Get outta my face, motherfucker!

01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:18.600
<i>Amid the chaos of that day,</i>

01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:22.200
<i>when all I could hear was
the thunder of gunshots...</i>

01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:25.600
<i>and all I could smell was
the violence in the air,</i>

01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:28.000
<i>I look back and am amazed...</i>

01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:30.900
<i>that my thoughts were
so clear and true--</i>

01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:34.700
<i>that 3 words went through my mind endlessly,</i>

01:55:34.900 --> 01:55:38.000
<i>repeating themselves like a broken record.</i>

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:42.200
<i>"You're so cool. You're so cool.</i>

01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:45.500
<i>You're so cool."</i>

01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:50.200
<i>And sometimes Clarence asks me what
I would have done if he had died,</i>

01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:54.400
<i>if that bullet had been
2 inches more to the left.</i>

01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:56.500
<i>To this, I always smile...</i>

01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:00.100
<i>as if I'm not going to
satisfy him with a response.</i>

01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:02.200
<i>But I always do.</i>

01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:05.000
<i>I tell him of how I would want to die,</i>

01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:10.800
<i>but that the anguish and the want of
death would fade like the stars at dawn...</i>

01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:15.500
<i>and that things would be
much as they are now, perhaps.</i>

01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:18.800
<i>Except maybe I wouldn't
have named our son...</i>

01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:21.000
<i>Elvis.</i>

01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:04.300
<i>No stars in the sky</i>

01:57:06.700 --> 01:57:10.000
<i>The night seems so dark around you</i>

01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:13.600
<i>You won't say a word</i>

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:19.500
<i>And wonder why no one's found you</i>

01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:22.600
<i>Waiting for love</i>

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.700
<i>Praying for love again</i>

01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:46.000
<i>Love's a heavy weight</i>

01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:50.300
<i>Give it to me Don't hesitate</i>

01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:52.300
<i>Love's a heavy thing</i>

01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:55.700
<i>Too heavy for one heart</i>

01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:58.600
<i>To bring me your love</i>

01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:03.300
<i>Give me your love again</i>

01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:05.300
<i>It's not your fault</i>

01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:08.400
<i>One heart can never win</i>

01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:11.200
<i>It takes 2 hearts</i>

01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:16.100
<i>2 hearts just to hold love</i>

01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:19.100
<i>2 hearts</i>

01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:27.200
<i>2 hearts just to hold your love</i>

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:33.500
<i>Your love</i>

01:58:54.200 --> 01:58:57.200
<i>And if your heart should ache</i>

01:58:57.300 --> 01:58:59.200
<i>Remember me</i>

01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:03.100
<i>And if your heart should break</i>

01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:08.600
<i>2 hearts</i>

01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:13.000
<i>2 hearts They can mend it</i>

01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:15.200
<i>Heartache</i>

01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:19.800
<i>Heartaches can be mended by love</i>

01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:23.300
<i>By love</i>

01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:27.700
<i>Love's a heavy weight</i>

01:59:29.100 --> 01:59:31.700
<i>Give it to me Don't hesitate</i>

01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:33.900
<i>Love's a heavy thing</i>

01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:37.100
<i>Too heavy for one heart</i>

01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:40.100
<i>To bring me your love</i>

01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:43.700
<i>Give me your love again</i>

01:59:44.900 --> 01:59:46.800
<i>It's not too late</i>

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:49.800
<i>One heart can never win</i>

01:59:50.100 --> 01:59:52.900
<i>It takes 2 hearts</i>

01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:57.400
<i>2 hearts just to hold love</i>

01:59:57.500 --> 02:00:00.500
<i>2 hearts</i>

02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:08.600
<i>2 hearts just to hold your love</i>

02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:18.000
<i>Your love</i>
