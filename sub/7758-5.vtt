00:09.810 --> 00:11.150
- * ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR

00:11.179 --> 00:13.179
* ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,
FIVE, SIX *

00:13.214 --> 00:16.254
* SHAKE IT, DUDE

00:16.283 --> 00:24.234
*

00:28.262 --> 00:31.802
* ONE, TWO, DO IT

00:31.832 --> 00:33.402

01:02.863 --> 01:04.703
[knocking on door]

01:04.732 --> 01:07.742
- [sighs]

01:07.768 --> 01:13.108
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

01:13.141 --> 01:16.241
- I'M THE GUY YOU FUCKED
LAST NIGHT.

01:17.345 --> 01:20.245
- OH, YEAH.

01:20.281 --> 01:23.721
WERE YOU ANY GOOD?

01:23.751 --> 01:27.261
[knocking on door]

01:27.288 --> 01:30.418
OKAY!
I'M COMING.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.358
AND YOU'RE GOING.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.474
- HI! WE JUST HAPPENED
TO BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

01:42.503 --> 01:46.143
SO I--
ARE WE INTERRUPTING SOMETHING?

01:46.174 --> 01:47.744
- NOT AT ALL.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.675
WE'RE ALL DONE.

01:49.710 --> 01:50.810
- THIS YOUR KID?

01:50.844 --> 01:53.284
- UH, YES.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.484
- OH-HO,
HE IS PRECIOUS!

01:56.517 --> 01:58.687
HELLO, HELLO!

01:58.719 --> 02:00.489
OH, BABY.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.261
HELLO, BABY.
HELLO.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.229
WE'LL DO THIS AGAIN.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.763
- YEAH. SURE.

02:10.798 --> 02:14.338
- LET ME GUESS.
YOUR ITALIAN TUTOR?

02:14.368 --> 02:17.238
[chuckles]

02:17.271 --> 02:18.171
- GRAZIE.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.506
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU VISITED
ONCE IN A WHILE,

02:19.540 --> 02:21.340
WE WOULDN'T NEED
TO DROP BY UNANNOUNCED.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.675
- TALK TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

02:22.710 --> 02:26.250
- YOU CAN'T EXACTLY BLAME HER,
THE WAY YOU BEHAVE.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.750
- SHE'S JUST JEALOUS
BECAUSE SHE THINKS YOU LOVE ME

02:27.781 --> 02:29.381
MORE THAN YOU LOVE HER.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.677
AND SHE'S RIGHT.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.348
- LOOK,
WE HAVE A CHILD NOW.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.586
- YEAH, YOU AND ME.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.261
- AND MELANIE.

02:35.289 --> 02:38.829
SO ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
WE ALL HAVE TO GET ALONG.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.829
- I'LL TRY.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.201
IF SHE DOUCHES.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.560
- [humorless chuckle]

02:43.597 --> 02:45.467
I THOUGHT WE COULD TRY
SOMETHING SMALL.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.499
A NICE, CIVILIZED,
HOME-COOKED MEAL?

02:48.536 --> 02:50.396
- SEASONED WITH A DASH
OF RAT POISON?

02:50.438 --> 02:51.808
- I WAS THINKING GARLIC.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.569
THERE'S A CHICKEN THING
I WANT TO TRY.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.277
IT HAS 40 CLOVES.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.439
COULD YOU STOMACH THAT?

02:56.477 --> 03:01.747
- THE CHICKEN OR MELANIE?

03:01.782 --> 03:05.822
- FRIDAY, EARLY?
SO YOU CAN STILL HIT THE BARS?

03:11.725 --> 03:13.585
- I HAVE 35Â¢ OFF
THE KITTIE BITES.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.427
- OH, WE DO COUPONS
AT THE END, AND, UH...

03:15.463 --> 03:18.973
THAT ONE EXPIRED IN 1992.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.629
- MARLEY,
YOU FREE TONIGHT?

03:20.668 --> 03:21.998
- DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
I'VE BEEN WAITING

03:22.035 --> 03:23.235
FOR A MAN TO ASK ME THAT?

03:23.271 --> 03:26.471
- I NEED SOMEBODY TO STAY LATE
AND HELP ME WITH INVENTORY.

03:26.507 --> 03:29.977
- OH, SORRY.
I'VE GOT CHURCH CHOIR PRACTICE.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.610
- WELL, THAT'S A NEW EXCUSE.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.305
- HOW MANY TIMES
CAN MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER

03:33.347 --> 03:34.817
BE ON HER DEATHBED?

03:34.848 --> 03:36.718
- I HAVE A COUPON
FOR THE JOHNNY-BOWL TOO.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.590
- I'M JUST FLUSHED
WITH EXCITEMENT, PRINCESS.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.550
- MIKE?

03:40.588 --> 03:42.458
IF YOU NEED SOMEONE
TO STAY LATE, I'M FREE.

03:42.490 --> 03:43.890
- YOU ARE?

03:43.924 --> 03:45.994
THAT'D BE GREAT.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.756
IT'LL ONLY TAKE
A COUPLE HOURS.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.356
- SHE WOULDN'T MIND
IF IT TOOK ALL NIGHT.

03:50.398 --> 03:53.368
- MARLEY.

03:54.602 --> 03:55.902
SO WE'LL MEET
AFTER CLOSING.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.666
- GREAT.
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.536
- JUST BE CAREFUL
YOU TWO DON'T GET CAUGHT

04:00.574 --> 04:01.914
ON THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS.

04:01.942 --> 04:05.752
[giggles]

04:05.779 --> 04:09.319
- WE USED TO SHARE THINGS.
WE...

04:09.350 --> 04:11.490
ENJOYED EACH OTHER.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.789
BUT NOW, I, UH...

04:13.821 --> 04:17.930
I TALK TO HIM,
HE SLAMS THE DOOR, RUNS AWAY.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.887
AND HE LIES.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.557
HE SAYS HE'S SPENDING
THE NIGHT AT DAPHNE'S,

04:21.595 --> 04:22.855
BUT I KNOW HE'S NOT.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.626
AND I FOUND THINGS.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.795
- WHAT SORT OF THINGS?

04:26.834 --> 04:28.804
- UM, DRAWINGS,

04:28.836 --> 04:31.866
SKETCHES THAT HE DID, OF...

04:31.905 --> 04:35.375
MEN...

04:35.409 --> 04:38.849
NAKED.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.649
I JUST HAVE...

04:41.682 --> 04:45.552
TO KNOW.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.386
- IF JUSTIN MIGHT BE GAY?

04:47.421 --> 04:50.961
- [sighs]

04:53.827 --> 04:55.397
HE'S ONLY 17.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.999
HE'S TOO YOUNG TO BE HAVING
THOSE FEELINGS TO BE--

05:01.969 --> 05:05.639
JUSTIN, HOW CAN YOU
POSSIBLY KNOW NOW WHO YOU ARE?

05:05.673 --> 05:08.543
- JUSTIN,
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY?

05:13.013 --> 05:15.823
- I LIKE DICK.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.819
I WANNA GET FUCKED BY DICK.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.421
I WANNA SUCK DICK.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.794
I LIKE SUCKING DICK.

05:22.823 --> 05:27.133
AND I'M GOOD AT IT TOO.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.860
- WELL, THAT'S A START.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.967
- YOUR EXISTING CAMPAIGN
IS SOLID, MR. TELSON,

05:36.003 --> 05:38.043
BUT YOU NEED MORE MUSCLE
TO BREAK OUT

05:38.071 --> 05:40.111
OF THE BORING
FAMILY MARKET BOX.

05:40.140 --> 05:43.740
TARGET MALES, OF COURSE,
18 TO 34.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.047
FEATURE SPEED, FASHION,
VISIBILITY.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.919
YOU SPONSOR A NASCAR TEAM,

05:47.948 --> 05:50.578
BUT YOU NEED A CAMPAIGN
TO MAX THE INVESTMENT.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.448
TV, PRINT,

05:52.486 --> 05:54.456
SELECTED WEBSITES.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.158
- JUST SO YOU KNOW,
MR. TELSON,

05:56.189 --> 05:59.929
UH, BRIAN IS OUR MOST DYNAMIC
AND CREATIVE ACCOUNT EXEC.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.530
HIS CAMPAIGNS HAVE WON
CLIO AWARDS FOR US.

06:02.563 --> 06:03.603
- UH-HUH.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.131
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE...

06:05.165 --> 06:06.895
FOR YOU.

06:06.934 --> 06:09.404
HOW DOES THAT TRANSLATE
TO NATIONAL SALES FOR ME?

06:09.437 --> 06:11.907
- WELL, UH,
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO SIT DOWN

06:11.939 --> 06:13.739
AND FLESH OUT THE STRATEGY
WITH HIM.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.414
HE'S ALSO, UH,
ONE HELL OF A HOST.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.714
HE CAN GET YOU
INTO ALL THE TOP RESTAURANTS.

06:18.746 --> 06:23.146
HE CAN GET YOU THE BEST TICKETS
TO THE GAMES.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.723
TELL ME, DO YOU LIKE BASEBALL,
MR. TELSON?

06:25.753 --> 06:28.163
- I'M PRETTY TIRED AFTER
THE FLIGHT THIS MORNING, AND...

06:28.188 --> 06:30.988
I'VE GOT A FULL SET
OF MEETINGS TOMORROW.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.534
- WELL,
HOW ABOUT TOMORROW NIGHT?

06:32.560 --> 06:34.430
THE PIRATES ARE PLAYING.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.832
WE HAVE COMPANY SEATS
ON THE FIRST BASE LINE.

06:36.864 --> 06:40.634
- WELL, IF I HAVE ANY TIME,
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.

06:40.668 --> 06:43.398
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.513
- I KNOW WHAT THE SON
OF A BITCH IS UP TO.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.505
HE'S PLAYING US AGAINST
EVERY OTHER AGENCY IN TOWN,

06:53.547 --> 06:55.117
PUMPING US
FOR OUR BEST IDEAS,

06:55.148 --> 06:58.148
AND HE'LL TAKE THEM
WHERE HE WANTS TO.

06:58.185 --> 07:01.585
- YOU JUST MAKE SURE
WHERE HE WANTS TO GO IS HERE.

07:06.126 --> 07:10.696
[indistinct chatter]

07:10.731 --> 07:12.801
- WELL, IF I DON'T GET
THIS ACCOUNT, I'LL BE FUCKED.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.233
AND WITHOUT LUBE.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.867
- AND THAT'S A BAD THING?

07:15.903 --> 07:17.473
- IT'S AMAZING
HOW YOU ALWAYS WORK

07:17.505 --> 07:19.235
ANAL INTERCOURSE
INTO THE CONVERSATION.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.872
- HEY, YOU TRY
SPENDING AN EVENING

07:20.908 --> 07:23.038
WITH SOME BACK-SLAPPING
BREEDER FROM ALTOONA,

07:23.076 --> 07:25.076
SMOKING CIGARS
AND TALKING ABOUT PUSSY.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.252
- I'D LOVE TO HEAR WHAT YOU
HAVE TO SAY ABOUT PUSSY.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.320
- THAT IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU'VE GOT ONE

07:28.348 --> 07:30.878
BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH A DICK.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.948
- MOVE OVER.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.757
SO YOU BOYS IN THE MOOD
FOR SOMETHING SWEET,

07:35.789 --> 07:37.729
OR ARE YOU GONNA PICK UP
A LITTLE SOMETHING AT WOODY'S?

07:37.758 --> 07:39.058
[chuckles]

07:39.092 --> 07:40.832
- MA, STOP PINCHING
MY CHEEKS.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.031
- OH, BEND OVER,
SO I CAN PINCH THE OTHER ONES.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.573
[laughs]

07:44.598 --> 07:45.828
- I'VE GOT SOME TAX REPORTS
TO GO OVER.

07:45.866 --> 07:46.966
SCOOT.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
- I WOULD THINK AFTER
CHECKING OUT NUMBERS ALL DAY,

07:49.036 --> 07:51.036
YOU'D LIKE TO COME CHECK OUT
SOME NUMBERS AT NIGHT.

07:51.071 --> 07:55.111
- WELL, IN LIGHT OF MY RECENT
NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE,

07:55.142 --> 07:57.582
I'VE DECIDED TO TAKE ACCOUNT
OF MY NEAR-LIFE.

07:57.611 --> 08:01.681
WOODY'S AND BABYLON ARE
NO LONGER DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.015
- HE'LL BE BACK.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.093
LOOKS LIKE IT'S, UH,
IT'S JUST US.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.721
THE THREE MUSKETEERS.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.257
- MORE LIKE
THE POINTER SISTERS.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.791
[chuckles]

08:12.826 --> 08:14.286
- I CAN'T GO EITHER.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.857
- WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

08:15.896 --> 08:17.196
- I HAVE TO GO BACK
TO THE STORE.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.970
WE'RE RESTOCKING.
- POOR BABY.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.940
SPEND THE ENTIRE EVENING ALONE
IN THAT DREARY CRAP EMPORIUM.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.210
- TRACY WILL BE THERE.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.838
- YOUR BRIDE-TO-BE?

08:26.874 --> 08:28.844
- SHE'S NOT MY BRIDE-TO-BE.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.276
- THEN YOU CAN TELL HER
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.351
- I AGREE.

08:32.379 --> 08:36.149
I ALWAYS SAY, COME CLEAN,
OR DON'T COME AT ALL.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.753
- I CAN'T.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.215
WHERE I WORK,
THEY LAUGH AT FAGGOTS.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.722
- HEY, THE ONLY FAGGOTS
WORTH LAUGHING AT

08:40.754 --> 08:43.164
ARE THE ONES
WHO DON'T TELL THE TRUTH.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.890
DON'T BE ONE OF THOSE ASSHOLES
WHO HIDES, MIKEY.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.596
AND STOP LEADING HER ON.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.128
- WHO'S LEADING HER ON?
WE'RE...

08:49.162 --> 08:51.302
COUNTING CARTONS
OF TOILET PAPER.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.871
- YEAH, WHICH YOU CAN USE,

08:52.900 --> 08:56.700
BECAUSE YOU'RE
SO FULL OF SHIT.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.169
- DON'T TOUCH ME.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.838
- OKAY, WE'VE DONE
TOILET PAPER, PAPER TOWELS,

09:03.877 --> 09:08.047
PAPER NAPKINS,
PAPER PLATES--

09:08.081 --> 09:09.681
TRACY?

09:09.717 --> 09:11.687
TRACE?

09:11.719 --> 09:13.919
- I'M HERE.
- WHERE?

09:13.954 --> 09:15.724
- IN FEMININE HYGIENE.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.656
I'M CHECKING PANTY LINERS.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.331
LIGHT DAYS AND HEAVY DAYS.

09:19.359 --> 09:20.659
- SO HOW WE DOING?

09:20.694 --> 09:21.934
- WE'RE HEAVY
ON LIGHT DAYS,

09:21.962 --> 09:23.662
AND LIGHT ON HEAVY DAYS.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.697
- GOTCHA.
LET'S MOVE ON.

09:25.733 --> 09:29.073
- IT'S ALWAYS WORK WITH YOU.
DON'T YOU EVER HAVE FUN?

09:29.102 --> 09:30.372
- YEAH, I HAVE FUN.
I HAVE LOTS OF FUN.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.503
- REALLY?

09:31.538 --> 09:34.208
'CAUSE YOU NEVER WANT
TO GO OUT WITH US AFTER WORK.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.081
- I'VE GONE OUT
WITH YOU GUYS.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.349
- ONCE.

09:38.378 --> 09:41.648
MARLEY SAYS NO ONE KNOWS
WHAT YOU'RE REALLY LIKE,

09:41.682 --> 09:45.092
THAT YOU PROBABLY LEAD
THIS DOUBLE LIFE.

09:45.118 --> 09:48.088
- SHE'S RIGHT.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.629
I'M NOT
WHO I APPEAR TO BE.

09:52.660 --> 09:56.800
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE
NOT TO TELL ANYONE.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.170
TRUTH IS,
WHEN I WAS A BOY,

09:58.198 --> 10:00.868
I WAS EXPOSED TO A LASER
LIGHT SHOW AT A KISS CONCERT,

10:00.901 --> 10:03.871
AND AFTER THAT,
I DEVELOPED THE STRANGE POWER

10:03.904 --> 10:06.174
TO SEE
INTO PEOPLE'S MINDS,

10:06.206 --> 10:09.236
TO READ
THEIR MOST PRIVATE THOUGHTS.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.376
[gruffly]
"I'M GOING TO ROB A BANK."

10:12.412 --> 10:15.052
"I'M GOING TO BLOW UP
A BRIDGE."

10:15.082 --> 10:16.352
[normal voice]
AND SINCE THEN, I SET OUT

10:16.383 --> 10:18.953
TO PREVENT CRIMES
BEFORE THEY HAPPENED.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.046
AND MY REAL NAME...

10:21.088 --> 10:24.758
IS "LASER MAN."

10:24.792 --> 10:29.832
- SO, LASER MAN,
WHAT AM I THINKING?

10:29.863 --> 10:33.733
- UM, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GET BACK TO WORK.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.737
WHOA.

[dance music]

10:38.772 --> 10:40.442
*

10:40.473 --> 10:42.283
- IF YOU TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF,
YOU GET A FREE DRINK.

10:42.309 --> 10:46.879
- I DON'T SHOW MY TITS
FOR A WATERED-DOWN BUD.

10:46.914 --> 10:47.884
- GET ME A BEER?

10:47.915 --> 10:50.015
- GET YOUR OWN.
- I'M TOO YOUNG.

10:50.050 --> 10:53.050
- WELL, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.146
YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.687
YOUR MOM'S PROBABLY
WORRIED SICK.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.093
- [scoffs]
SHE'S PATHETIC.

10:57.124 --> 11:01.764
SHE TOOK ME TO A FUCKING
WASTE-OF-TIME THERAPIST.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.895
- MAYBE SHE'S TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND YOU.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.831
- I DON'T WANT HER
TO UNDERSTAND ME.

11:05.866 --> 11:10.166
I WANT HER
TO LEAVE ME ALONE.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.313
WHAT DID YOUR PARENTS DO
WHEN THEY FOUND OUT YOU WERE...

11:12.339 --> 11:15.039
YOU KNOW, GAY?

11:15.075 --> 11:18.475
- THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.111
- * JUST LET ME BE

11:20.147 --> 11:21.777
- BECAUSE I NEVER TOLD THEM.

11:21.815 --> 11:24.275
- YOU DIDN'T?

11:24.317 --> 11:27.987
- IT'S NOT THEIR LIFE.

11:28.021 --> 11:33.061
I DON'T NEED
THEIR APPROVAL.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.303
- DAPH?
- PLEASE DON'T KILL ME.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.328
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
- WHAT'S NOT YOUR FAULT?

11:37.364 --> 11:39.004
- MY MOM ANSWERED.
SHE SAID YOU WEREN'T THERE.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.232
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

11:40.267 --> 11:43.467
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.843
- [sighs]

11:45.873 --> 11:49.083
- FUCK ME.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.509
WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?

11:50.543 --> 11:52.213
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO TELL YOU.

11:52.245 --> 11:55.375
I SAID YOU WERE HERE.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.986
- JUSTIN.

12:07.227 --> 12:12.167
- * JUST LET ME BE
WHAT I WANT TO BE *

12:14.534 --> 12:19.874
* JUST LET ME LIVE
HOW I WANT TO LIVE *

12:21.875 --> 12:25.845
* JUST LET ME BE
WHAT I-- *

12:25.879 --> 12:27.109
- [sighs]

12:27.147 --> 12:28.347
HE'S DOWN.

12:28.381 --> 12:31.951
- HE'LL BE UP.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.015
YOU LOOK BEAT.

12:33.053 --> 12:36.023
- SO DO YOU.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.255
COMING TO BED?
- SOON.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.434
I GOTTA GO
OVER THESE BRIEFS.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.473
- LISTEN, ABOUT FRIDAY...

12:45.498 --> 12:46.528
- MM-HMM?

12:46.566 --> 12:48.496
- YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS,
DO YOU?

12:48.535 --> 12:50.235
- NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.810
- NOT WORKING LATE?
- NO.

12:53.841 --> 12:54.911
[sighs]

12:54.942 --> 12:57.112
- THAT'S GOOD,

12:57.144 --> 12:59.014
BECAUSE I INVITED BRIAN
FOR DINNER.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.406
- OH, CHRIST.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.477
- I THOUGHT I'D MAKE
THAT CHICKEN YOU LIKE.

13:01.514 --> 13:02.854
- FORGET IT.

13:02.883 --> 13:03.983
I WOULDN'T LET HIM
TOUCH MY SILVERWARE,

13:04.017 --> 13:05.287
KNOWING WHERE HIS HANDS
HAVE BEEN.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.488
- YOU KNOW, I WISH
THE TWO OF YOU WOULD MAKE

13:06.519 --> 13:08.319
THE SLIGHTEST EFFORT
TO GET ALONG,

13:08.355 --> 13:09.155
SO I DON'T HAVE TO BE

13:09.189 --> 13:11.159
THE SMILING LESBIAN
IN THE MIDDLE.

13:11.191 --> 13:14.231
- WHO ASKED YOU TO BE?
JUST LEAVE HIM OUT OF MY LIFE.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.231
- HOW CAN WE?
HE'S GUS'S FATHER.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.303
- AS IF I NEED
TO BE REMINDED.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.572
YOU KNOW, WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE FAMILY,

13:21.601 --> 13:23.441
WHICH MEANS TWO MOMMIES.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.570
- I'M THE ONE WITH
THE SUBSCRIPTION TO NEWSWEEK,

13:25.605 --> 13:27.365
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.037
ONLY THERE'S NOTHING
"ALTERNATIVE" ABOUT US.

13:30.077 --> 13:31.607
WE'RE AS FUCKED UP
AS ANY OTHER FAMILY

13:31.644 --> 13:33.314
IN THE HISTORY
OF THE WORLD.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.576
[chuckles]

13:35.615 --> 13:37.475
- SO...

13:37.517 --> 13:40.187
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

13:40.220 --> 13:43.960
- I WANT TO BE
A GOOD MOTHER.

13:43.991 --> 13:46.391
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.059
AND I WANT YOU
TO GIVE BRIAN A CHANCE.

13:51.098 --> 13:52.468
- AW, YOU ALMOST
HAD ME THERE.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.199
- HE'S A GOOD PERSON.
- HE'S A SELFISH SHITHEAD.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.135
- MAYBE, BUT HE'S HONEST.
- [sighs]

13:57.170 --> 13:59.270
- AND HE TELLS THE TRUTH,
AND HE DOESN'T PRETEND.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.036
- YEAH, WELL I WISH
HE'D TRY.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.744
- I WISH
YOU WOULD TOO.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.954
[groan]

14:10.984 --> 14:12.394
[playful giggle]

14:15.322 --> 14:18.332
[dance music]

14:18.358 --> 14:20.328
*

14:20.360 --> 14:22.400
- OH, MAN.
I'M SO HORNY.

14:22.429 --> 14:25.199
I WANT YOU TO FUCK ME
FOR HOURS...

14:25.232 --> 14:26.202
[whispering]
AND I'M A TOP.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.673
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT ALL
THE BIGGEST BOTTOMS SAY.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.071
- YEAH?

14:31.104 --> 14:32.644
- OH, FUCK.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.242
- JESUS, WHO'S THIS?

14:34.274 --> 14:36.314
- THAT'S THE PRESIDENT
OF MY FAN CLUB.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.643
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.277
- MY MOM'S OUT OF CONTROL.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.682
NOW SHE'S FOLLOWING ME.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.053
- THAT MUST BE
AN INHERITED TRAIT.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.122
- I'M NOT GOING HOME.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.220
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT
STAYING HERE.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.491
- THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE
I CAN GO.

14:45.518 --> 14:46.918
DO YOU WANT ME TO SLEEP
ON THE STREET?

14:46.954 --> 14:47.964
I COULD GET KILLED.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.518
- WHY DON'T YOU GET LOST,
YOU LITTLE ASSHOLE?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.256
I WAS HERE FIRST.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.631
- BETTER YET,
WHY DON'T YOU?

14:53.660 --> 14:55.430
- [scoffs]
- BEAT IT.

14:55.462 --> 14:56.702
- FUCK YOU.
- [chuckles] YEAH.

14:56.729 --> 15:01.029
YOU'RE THE BOTTOM,
REMEMBER?

15:01.068 --> 15:03.998
- THANKS.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.267
- LOOK, I TOLD YOU.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.605
I'M NOT YOUR LOVER,

15:06.639 --> 15:09.079
I'M NOT YOUR PARTNER,
I'M NOT EVEN YOUR FRIEND.

15:09.109 --> 15:12.109
YOU'RE NOT ANYTHING
TO ME.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.145
- I COULD BE...

15:14.181 --> 15:15.451
IF YOU GAVE ME A CHANCE.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.682
- [chuckles]

15:16.716 --> 15:18.546
WHERE DID YOU LEARN
TO TALK LIKE THAT?

15:18.585 --> 15:22.155
WATCHING SOME TEEN DRAMA?

15:22.189 --> 15:24.419
- I NEED YOU.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.127
- NO, YOU THINK YOU DO

15:26.159 --> 15:27.459
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE TAUGHT TO THINK,

15:27.494 --> 15:29.404
WE ALL NEED EACH OTHER.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.059
WELL, IT'S A CROCK
OF SHIT.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.628
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
YOU NEED.

15:32.665 --> 15:36.065
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
YOU'VE GOT.

15:44.777 --> 15:48.077
THE COUCH.
JUST FOR TONIGHT.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.445
AND DON'T JERK OFF ON IT.

15:56.156 --> 15:59.356
- MORNING, SWEET PEA.
[giggles]

16:01.794 --> 16:05.004
- [groans]

16:05.032 --> 16:06.632
GOD, I AM STILL STIFF.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.096
- STIFFER THAN LAST NIGHT?

16:08.135 --> 16:10.335
- HEY, YOU TWO,
LET'S KEEP IT CLEAN.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.340
- WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT MY NECK.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.312
- YOU MUST HAVE BEEN DOING
MORE THAN INVENTORY.

16:14.341 --> 16:17.241
- SHUT UP, MARLEY.
CAN'T YOU SEE HE'S IN PAIN?

16:17.277 --> 16:20.047
- IT'S THE WORST PAIN
I'VE EVER FELT IN MY LIFE.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.350
- DID YOU TAKE SOMETHING?

16:21.381 --> 16:23.081
- YEAH.
LIKE, TWO BOTTLES OF TYLENOL.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.746
- THAT WON'T HELP.
YOU NEED A CHIROPRACTOR.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.615
- NO.
I'M OKAY, REALLY.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.094
- A FRIEND
OF MINE'S FIANCE

16:29.122 --> 16:31.362
GOES TO SOMEONE WHO DOES
SOME OF THE STEELERS.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.491
HE SWEARS BY HIM.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.685
- IT'S NOT NECESSARY.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.197
- YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

16:37.230 --> 16:41.270
I CAN TELL
YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT THAT.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.105
- RYDER WANTS TO SEE YOU.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.580
- WELL,
HE CAN GO FUCK HIMSELF.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.408
HE'S PISSED AT ME
FOR NOT LANDING TELSON.

16:51.444 --> 16:52.784
HE WANTS TO CHEW ME
A SECOND ASSHOLE.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.452
- I ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU COULD USE ONE OF THOSE.

16:54.481 --> 16:55.681
- MARVIN.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.375
- I WAS JUST
COMING TO SEE YOU.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.817
- WELL, I'LL JUST BE SURE
AND GIVE MR. RYDER YOUR MESSAGE.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.652
EXCUSE ME.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.388
- I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ME
DROPPING BY.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.593
- NOT AT ALL.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.464
ALTHOUGH AFTER YESTERDAY,
I SORT OF GOT THE IMPRESSION--

17:06.492 --> 17:09.433
- WELL, YOU KNOW HOW MISLEADING
FIRST IMPRESSIONS CAN BE.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.202
AFTER YOU GET
TO KNOW SOMEBODY,

17:11.231 --> 17:15.441
YOU DISCOVER JUST HOW MUCH
IN COMMON YOU ACTUALLY HAVE.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.798
- SO SHALL WE LOOK
AT SOME IDEAS I HAVE?

17:16.836 --> 17:17.836
- GREAT.

17:17.869 --> 17:18.970
OH, AND ABOUT THIS EVENING,

17:19.005 --> 17:22.234
I THOUGHT I MIGHT TAKE YOU UP
ON YOUR OFFER TO, UH,

17:22.275 --> 17:23.734
SHOW ME THE TOWN.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.445
- WELL, I COULD HAVE CYNTHIA
MAKE US SOME RESERVATIONS.

17:26.479 --> 17:27.549
YOU LIKE STEAKS?

17:27.579 --> 17:29.420
I KNOW
A GREAT CHOPHOUSE.

17:29.449 --> 17:33.319
AND I COULD GET US TICKETS
FOR TONIGHT'S GAME.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.553
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
I HAD A...

17:34.587 --> 17:36.187
DIFFERENT SORT OF EVENING
IN MIND.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.563
YOU KNOW, THE SORT OF EVENING
THAT YOU MIGHT...

17:38.591 --> 17:40.391
PLAN FOR YOURSELF.

17:40.427 --> 17:41.727
- AND WHAT SORT OF EVENING
IS THAT?

17:41.761 --> 17:44.731
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
ONE THAT'S MORE FUN.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.504
LIKE THIS CLUB
THAT I HEARD ABOUT.

17:46.533 --> 17:49.803
UH, BABYLON?

17:49.836 --> 17:51.296
- WHY, MARVIN.

17:51.338 --> 17:54.808
YOU OLD DOG.

17:54.841 --> 17:58.711
CHRIST.
ISN'T ANYONE STRAIGHT ANYMORE?

17:58.745 --> 18:00.675
- [chuckles]

18:13.460 --> 18:16.900
- [sighs]

18:16.929 --> 18:18.769
- HI.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.728
I'M, UH, I'M DR. CAMERON.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.642
WHAT SEEMS TO BE
THE PROBLEM?

18:27.674 --> 18:29.344
- UM, NOTHING.
NOTHING.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.276
[chuckles]
NOTHING AT ALL. I'M FINE.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.511
[softly]
OW.

18:38.651 --> 18:39.821
- HOW DID YOU
HURT YOURSELF?

18:39.852 --> 18:42.222
- UM...
I WAS WORKING AT THE STORE.

18:42.255 --> 18:47.485
I'M AN ASSISTANT MANAGER
AT THE BIG Q OVER ON BUTLER.

18:47.527 --> 18:52.267
I ACCIDENTLY FELL.
- HMM.

18:52.299 --> 18:55.699
OKAY, TURN TO THE LEFT.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.365
HOW'S THAT FEEL?

18:57.404 --> 18:59.944
- FINE.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.242
- TO THE RIGHT.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.375

19:11.284 --> 19:12.694
- MM.

19:12.719 --> 19:15.689
SURE.
ON MY BACK.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.585
THIS IS
MY FAVORITE POSITION.

19:20.627 --> 19:21.827
I'M JUST KIDDING.
[crack]

19:21.861 --> 19:23.231
OH.

19:48.921 --> 19:49.761
- HE DIDN'T COME HOME
LAST NIGHT,

19:49.789 --> 19:52.359
AND I WAS HOPING
YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN HIM.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.762
- UH, NO, I'M SORRY.

19:54.794 --> 19:58.574
SWEETIE, I WISH I HAD.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.298

"GET HAPPY."

20:32.899 --> 20:34.029
YOU NEED IT.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.636
- * FOOLING YOURSELF

20:36.669 --> 20:39.509
* AND EVERYBODY ELSE

20:39.539 --> 20:41.369
- SO WHAT'D HIS DAD SAY?

20:41.408 --> 20:42.578
- HE DOESN'T KNOW.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.339
- HOW COULD HE NOT KNOW?

20:44.377 --> 20:45.877
YOU ALWAYS KNOW.

20:45.912 --> 20:49.322
- SAME REASON I DIDN'T.
DIDN'T WANT TO.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.349
- BELIEVE ME,
THERE ARE FAR WORSE THINGS.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.554
- I JUST KEEP THINKING
IT'S MY--

20:52.585 --> 20:53.585
- IT'S NOT.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.460
- THAT I WAS--
- YOU DIDN'T.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.458
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.630
- YEAH, I DO.

20:59.659 --> 21:04.059
'CAUSE I ASKED MYSELF
ALL THE SAME THINGS.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.896
- SO YOU DON'T THINK
IT WAS BECAUSE I...

21:06.933 --> 21:07.973
- SMOTHERED HIM?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.500
YOU SMOTHER
A PORK CHOP.

21:10.537 --> 21:13.367
NOT A SON.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.436
PEOPLE ARE WHAT THEY ARE.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.705
- * HEY,
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE *

21:17.744 --> 21:18.514
* IN A HURRY

21:18.545 --> 21:21.645
- SO DID HE TELL YOU
TO FUCK OFF?

21:21.681 --> 21:23.521
- WASN'T EVEN
THE WORST OF IT,

21:23.550 --> 21:27.820
HE TOLD HIS THERAPIST
THAT HE LIKES...

21:27.854 --> 21:28.924
DICK.

21:28.955 --> 21:29.915
- * PSYCHOANALYZE

21:29.956 --> 21:31.086
- THERE, YOU SEE?

21:31.123 --> 21:33.733
YOU ALREADY HAVE SOMETHING
IN COMMON.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.400
I'M SURE YOU WERE THINKING
YOU'D PROBABLY

21:35.428 --> 21:37.398
NEVER HAVE ANYTHING
TO SHARE AGAIN.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.530
[chuckles]

21:39.566 --> 21:41.726
- * IN A HURRY

21:41.768 --> 21:43.998
* STILL IN A HURRY

21:44.036 --> 21:46.936
- LISTEN.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.543
THEY TALK BIG,
AND THEY ACT TOUGH,

21:50.577 --> 21:53.377
BUT THE TRUTH IS, THE THING
HE'S THE MOST AFRAID OF,

21:53.413 --> 21:54.553
EVEN MORE THAN HIS DAD
FINDING OUT

21:54.581 --> 21:57.651
AND BEATING
THE SHIT OUT OF HIM,

21:57.684 --> 22:00.894
IS THAT YOU'LL
STOP LOVING HIM.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.760
- I COULD NEVER DO THAT.

22:02.789 --> 22:07.029
- THEN YOU BE SURE HE KNOWS
HE HASN'T LOST YOU.

22:08.861 --> 22:11.031
- CROSS YOUR HANDS
OVER YOUR CHEST.

22:11.063 --> 22:13.933
GOOD.
BRING YOUR KNEES UP.

22:13.966 --> 22:18.436
GOOD.

22:18.471 --> 22:22.511
OKAY.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.442
FIRST TIME
TO A CHIROPRACTOR?

22:24.477 --> 22:25.947
- YEAH, BUT IF I KNEW
IT WAS GOING TO BE LIKE THIS,

22:25.978 --> 22:27.908
I'D HAVE COME SOONER.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.447
[groan]

22:29.482 --> 22:32.752
- GOOD.
LEGS DOWN.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.962
LITTLE STRETCH.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.591
- [groans]

22:40.627 --> 22:42.597
- AM I HURTING YOU?

22:42.629 --> 22:45.899
- NOT AT ALL.

22:45.932 --> 22:48.472
- OKAY.

22:48.501 --> 22:51.471
ROLL OVER.

22:53.773 --> 22:56.743
- OH.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.949
[groans of relief]

23:05.985 --> 23:07.445
- HOW'S THAT FEEL?

23:07.487 --> 23:10.187
- OH, YEAH.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.832
- WELL, I THINK YOU'RE SUFFERING
FROM A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION

23:12.859 --> 23:15.429
THAT WAS JUST AGGRAVATED
BY THAT FALL.

23:15.462 --> 23:18.202
YOU GIVE IT A LITTLE TIME
AND SOME REST AND...

23:18.230 --> 23:19.900
LET THE SWELLING GO DOWN.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.732
- RIGHT.

23:21.768 --> 23:25.098
- YOU, UH, YOU MIGHT WANNA
PUT SOME ICE ON IT.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.137
- GOOD IDEA.

23:26.172 --> 23:28.742
- OKAY, YOU CAN GET UP.

23:28.775 --> 23:31.035
- UM, IF IT'S OKAY
WITH YOU,

23:31.077 --> 23:34.077
I'D LIKE TO JUST LIE HERE
FOR A COUPLE MINUTES?

23:34.113 --> 23:35.583
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

23:35.615 --> 23:36.575
SOMETHING I SHOULD LOOK AT,
OR--

23:36.616 --> 23:37.846
- NO.

23:37.884 --> 23:41.854
NO, UM...I FEEL GREAT.
[deep breath]

23:41.888 --> 23:46.658
TOO GREAT.

23:46.693 --> 23:49.203
- DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.

23:49.228 --> 23:51.998
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.971
EVEN TO FOOTBALL PLAYERS.

24:03.710 --> 24:06.450
[crowd cheering]

24:16.155 --> 24:20.985
- 7 3/4 INCHES.

24:21.027 --> 24:23.627
OH, COME ON, GUYS.
LET'S GET IT UP FOR HIM.

24:23.663 --> 24:27.803
COME ON.
[crowd cheering]

24:27.834 --> 24:29.974
- THERE'S THOMAS.
HE'S 17.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.242
HE'S GOING INTO HARVARD
THIS FALL.

24:31.270 --> 24:33.640
AND THERE'S TRISH,
SHE'S 12.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.113
SHE LOVES SOCCER.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.811
- [laughs]
THIS HAS GOT TO BE A FIRST.

24:37.844 --> 24:40.084
FAMILY PHOTOS IN BABYLON?

24:40.112 --> 24:44.052
- OOH. WHAT IS THIS?
5 1/8.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.753
NOW--
NOW, CONTESTANTS ARE REMINDED

24:46.786 --> 24:48.886
THAT THEY MUST BE
AT LEAST 6 INCHES.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.721
UH, THAT IS
THE RULE OF THUMB,

24:50.757 --> 24:53.727
AND QUITE FRANKLY,
I'VE SEEN BIGGER THUMBS.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.730
[crowd laughing]

24:55.762 --> 24:58.262
- I MARRIED YOUNG,
BEFORE I KNEW.

24:58.297 --> 25:00.127
WENT INTO
THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.966
BY THE TIME I REALIZED
WHAT I WAS,

25:02.001 --> 25:03.741
IT WAS TOO LATE
TO CHANGE THINGS.

25:03.770 --> 25:08.040
I LOVE MY WIFE
AND MY KIDS.

25:08.074 --> 25:11.144
WHY SHOULD I DESTROY
ALL THAT?

25:11.177 --> 25:13.047
- YOU KNOW, MY FRIENDS
THINK THAT...

25:13.079 --> 25:16.549
- SO YOU TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS
WHILE YOU'RE AWAY,

25:16.583 --> 25:17.983
TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS?

25:18.017 --> 25:20.587
- EXACTLY.

25:20.620 --> 25:23.160
- SMART MAN, MARVIN.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.859
- YOU'RE A SMART MAN TOO.

25:24.891 --> 25:27.261
THE QUESTION IS,
HOW SMART?

25:27.293 --> 25:30.803
- 10 5/16.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.830
WE HAVE A WINNER!
[cheering]

25:37.937 --> 25:40.167
- SO IS THERE ANYONE HERE
YOU'D LIKE TO MEET?

25:40.206 --> 25:44.206
I HAPPEN TO KNOW
THE WINNER.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.713
- NO, NOT MY TYPE.

25:46.746 --> 25:50.946
HOWEVER, THERE IS SOMEBODY
I'M INTERESTED IN.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.023
- YEAH?
WHO?

26:01.193 --> 26:02.603
- THAT'S SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.699
- YEAH, REMIND ME
TO PRESS CHARGES.

26:04.731 --> 26:05.701
- WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE?

26:05.732 --> 26:06.902
- LIKE THE KIND OF GUY,

26:06.933 --> 26:08.203
IF HE WAGGED HIS DICK
IN FRONT OF YOU,

26:08.234 --> 26:10.304
YOU WOULDN'T LOOK TWICE.

26:10.336 --> 26:12.166
BUT IF HE DANGLED HIS ACCOUNT
IN FRONT OF YOU,

26:12.204 --> 26:13.974
YOU MIGHT CONSIDER IT.

26:14.006 --> 26:18.076
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
YOU WOULDN'T ACTUALLY DO--

26:18.110 --> 26:19.650
WOULD YOU?

26:19.679 --> 26:21.679
- WELL, CONSIDERING SOME
OF THE OTHER THINGS I'VE DONE.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.154
- YEAH, BUT THAT
WAS FOR FUN.

26:23.182 --> 26:26.652
YOU'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING
LIKE THIS.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.216
- [chuckles]

26:28.254 --> 26:30.824
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFULLY NAIVE,
MIKEY.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.387
IT'S BUSINESS.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.794
YOU FUCK,
OR YOU GET FUCKED.

26:34.827 --> 26:37.857
- YEAH, ONLY WHICH END
ARE YOU ON?

26:42.334 --> 26:44.844
- IT'S IN MY LOCKER.

26:44.871 --> 26:47.841
- JUSTIN?

26:47.874 --> 26:49.714
HONEY, PLEASE.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.842
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
TO COME WITH ME.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.048
- WHERE?

26:53.079 --> 26:55.109
TO SEE ANOTHER SHRINK?

26:55.147 --> 26:58.177
- IT'S A SURPRISE.
- I'M NOT INTERESTED.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.824
[car alert beeping]

27:03.856 --> 27:06.356
- YOU STOP RIGHT THERE.

27:06.392 --> 27:07.992
STOP RUNNING FROM ME

27:08.027 --> 27:11.727
BECAUSE I'M NOT RUNNING
FROM YOU.

27:11.764 --> 27:14.104
I'M STILL YOUR MOTHER,
AND YOU'RE STILL MY SON,

27:14.133 --> 27:17.743
AND I STILL LOVE YOU.

27:28.881 --> 27:31.081
- [laughs]
WHAT'S THIS?

27:31.117 --> 27:33.147
- A GET-WELL BASKET.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.285
BENGAY, ASPIRIN,
HOT WATER BOTTLE.

27:35.321 --> 27:38.321
EVERYTHING YOU NEED
FOR A PULLED MUSCLE.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.827
- THAT'S REALLY NICE OF YOU,
TRACY.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.800
- AT BIG Q, WE GUARANTEE
FULL MONEY BACK

27:42.829 --> 27:44.199

COMPLETELY SATISFIED.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.400
- [chuckles]

27:45.431 --> 27:48.771
- I HOPE YOU WON'T
BE NEEDING ALL THAT.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.141
- OH, HI.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.899
- HI.
HOW'S YOUR NECK?

27:51.938 --> 27:55.708
- UH, IT'S STILL A LITTLE SORE,
BUT, UH, MUCH BETTER.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.382
I THINK YOU DID THE TRICK.
- GOOD TO HEAR.

27:57.409 --> 28:00.049
- UH, TRACY,
THIS IS DR. CAMERON,

28:00.079 --> 28:01.409
THE CHIROPRACTOR

28:01.447 --> 28:03.177
- THANKS FOR THE REFERRAL,
TRACY.

28:03.215 --> 28:06.285
- THANKS
FOR TAKING CARE OF MIKE.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.448
WELL, I SHOULD GO AND TAKE CARE
OF MY CASH REGISTER.

- SHE'S CUTE.
- YEAH.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.401
WHAT A COINCIDENCE,
RUNNING INTO YOU HERE.

28:16.428 --> 28:19.028
- WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY
A COINCIDENCE.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.995
YOU TOLD ME WHERE YOU WORKED,
REMEMBER?

28:21.033 --> 28:22.873
- OH, YEAH.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.272
WELL, THAT'S REALLY NICE,

28:24.303 --> 28:25.913
COMING ALL THIS WAY
JUST TO SEE HOW I AM.

28:25.938 --> 28:27.308
- NOTHING IS
MORE IMPORTANT

28:27.339 --> 28:28.839
THAN MY PATIENTS' HEALTH
AND WELL-BEING.

28:28.875 --> 28:29.775
- [chuckles]

28:29.809 --> 28:31.479
- I ALSO WANTED
TO GET A NEW SCREWDRIVER.

28:31.510 --> 28:32.810
- OH, WELL,
LET ME SHOW YOU

28:32.845 --> 28:33.945
WHERE THE HARDWARE
DEPARTMENT IS.

WE HAVE A COMPLETE LINE
OF TOOLS,

28:35.147 --> 28:36.817
ALL AT EVERYDAY LOW PRICES.

28:36.849 --> 28:39.049
- AND I WANTED TO, UH...

28:39.085 --> 28:42.345
ASK IF YOU'D LIKE
TO HAVE DINNER WITH ME.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.418
- HUH?
- DINNER.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.526
YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU SIT
AT A TABLE

28:46.558 --> 28:49.058
AND EAT FOOD
FROM A PLATE?

28:49.095 --> 28:50.455
- MIKE?

28:50.496 --> 28:51.826
THERE ARE THESE TWO BRATS

28:51.864 --> 28:53.474
CLIMBING UP
THE SOFT DRINK DISPLAY.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.129
- [chuckles]
SOUNDS LIKE A JOB FOR SUPERMAN.

28:55.167 --> 28:59.967
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

29:00.006 --> 29:01.936
- SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

29:01.974 --> 29:03.384
- ABOUT WHAT?

29:03.409 --> 29:06.179
- I THINK
I JUST ASKED YOU OUT.

29:06.212 --> 29:09.052
- YOU MEAN YOU'RE--

29:09.081 --> 29:10.251
- YEAH.

29:10.282 --> 29:13.392
I-I HOPE YOU ARE TOO.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.989
- [whispering]
I HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL.

29:15.021 --> 29:18.121
NO ONE HERE KNOWS.

29:18.157 --> 29:19.227
HOW DID YOU?

29:19.258 --> 29:21.528
- REMEMBER THAT LITTLE PROBLEM
YOU HAD ON MY TABLE?

29:21.560 --> 29:23.100
- YEAH, BUT YOU SAID
THAT EVEN HAPPENS

29:23.129 --> 29:24.399
TO FOOTBALL PLAYERS.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.530

ONLY THE GAY ONES.

29:26.565 --> 29:30.835
[chuckling]

29:30.870 --> 29:35.010
- JUSTIN, I HAVE SO MISSED
COMING HERE WITH YOU.

29:35.041 --> 29:38.411
THE VAN GOGHS
AND THE HOPPERS.

29:38.444 --> 29:41.984
YOU KNOW, IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME,
YOU WOULDN'T BE AN ARTIST.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.924
I MEAN,
I ENCOURAGED YOU.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.590
[both chuckle]

29:46.618 --> 29:47.818
HEY, AFTER WE'RE DONE,

29:47.854 --> 29:50.394
YOU WANT TO SHARE A PIECE OF
THAT INCREDIBLE CHOCOLATE CAKE

29:50.422 --> 29:52.222
LIKE WE USED TO?

29:52.258 --> 29:54.288
- YEAH, SURE.

29:54.326 --> 29:57.556
- OH, JUSTIN, LOOK.
MY FAVORITE.

29:57.596 --> 30:03.236
REMEMBER?

30:03.269 --> 30:06.169
- NO.

30:06.205 --> 30:10.035
- I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT WITH YOU.

30:10.076 --> 30:14.046
I EVEN PUT IT
ON YOUR BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENT.

30:14.080 --> 30:17.050
[rock music]

30:17.083 --> 30:19.093

WHERE YOU'VE BEEN *

30:37.503 --> 30:39.543

- ALL THAT COUNTS
IS A LITTLE, WHITE JACKET

31:19.145 --> 31:21.105
AT A COMFORTABLE
MID-THIGH LENGTH.

31:21.147 --> 31:22.507
IT'S EVERY MOTHER'S DREAM.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.148
- JUST BE SURE
NOT TO TELL MINE.

EVERY TIME I GO OUT.

31:38.297 --> 31:39.667
PROBABLY 40.

31:39.698 --> 31:41.398
- THAT IS OLD.

31:41.433 --> 31:43.273
- ON THE OTHER HAND,
THEY DON'T COME AS QUICK,

31:43.302 --> 31:45.002

LOTS OF MONEY.

31:45.037 --> 31:46.337
SO WHERE'S HE TAKING YOU?

31:46.372 --> 31:48.142
- SOME PLACE
CALLED PAPPAGANO.

31:48.174 --> 31:50.584

I HOPE HE'S PAYING.

31:50.609 --> 31:52.139
- IS IT EXPENSIVE?

31:52.178 --> 31:55.448

33:29.808 --> 33:32.508

WHAT TO DO OR SAY.

- THAT SHOULD MAKE
THE EVENING FLY BY.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.419

TO THE SEX?

- [chuckles]
THE POINT OF A DATE,

33:41.487 --> 33:42.817
OR SO IT'S BEEN EXPLAINED
TO ME

33:42.854 --> 33:44.564
BY THOSE WHO DO THAT SORT
OF THING,

IN NOTHING.

BESIDES, HE'S NOT
EVEN INTERESTED IN ME.
