00:01.251 --> 00:02.711
Previously on Prison Break...

00:02.794 --> 00:04.754
You have
a hypothalamus hamartoma.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.548
The doctor feels
that you need surgery.

00:06.631 --> 00:07.757
Otherwise, you could die.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.509
Are you not following
direct orders?

00:09.592 --> 00:12.387
Oh, I'm following
direct orders, sir.

00:12.470 --> 00:13.930
Just not from you anymore.

00:14.014 --> 00:17.142
I would've died on this table
if it weren't for you, Doc.

00:17.225 --> 00:19.019
What?

00:19.102 --> 00:20.520
Time to come home now.

00:20.603 --> 00:22.105
You're going to help me find
a new buyer for Scylla.

00:22.188 --> 00:25.025
His name is Vikan, and he's
not a buyer, he's a conduit.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.109
Let's go.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.527
And Bagwell's
staying here.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.154
I warned you
not to screw me over.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.531
-It's been a long time, Gretchen.
-Who's he?

00:31.614 --> 00:33.074
I'm the guy
that's holding Scylla.

00:33.158 --> 00:36.411
It's incomplete. There's
a piece missing, slick.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.499
Hello, Don.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.501
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

00:44.544 --> 00:45.545
Come and get it.

00:56.097 --> 00:58.433
Just so it's fresh in your mind,
this isn't a magic elixir.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.560
You still need a hospital.

01:00.643 --> 01:02.270
You need real equipment.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.273
Could probably
use a doctor

01:05.356 --> 01:07.275
who's still got a license
to practice medicine.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.568
First we get Scylla.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.362
Then I'll go to the hospital.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.688
You're surrounded.

02:26.771 --> 02:29.190
Come out with your
piece of Scylla, Michael.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.316
You first.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.028
Come out,
or I'm going to gas you out.

02:34.112 --> 02:38.741
If it's the latter, I have a
full magazine with 30 rounds.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.994
Want to bet at least
one of them could outrun you?

02:41.077 --> 02:43.079
What makes you think I'd
even keep the piece on me?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.205
Oh, I know you, Michael.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.999
You're not letting that
thing out of your sight.

02:46.082 --> 02:48.001
I stand by my
original offer.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.085
Come and get it.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.211
Okay.

02:53.798 --> 02:56.217
Stay low. Let the gas
rise to the ceiling.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.553
This is a big space, but it
won't take many more of those

02:58.636 --> 03:00.096
before we start
to asphyxiate.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.389
Where's Lincoln?!

03:04.184 --> 03:05.810
Here we go, Michael.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.231
All right, now we take a ride
and we pick up Scylla.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.565
Or I put a bullet
in your head.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.067
It ain't gonna happen.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.235
Try me.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.785
Good morning.

04:05.245 --> 04:09.040
Okay, all right, now that we
all have guns pointed at us,

04:09.123 --> 04:10.250
let's talk, okay?

04:10.333 --> 04:11.584
Fine.

04:11.668 --> 04:15.546
You could start by telling me
who I'm talking to, Don?

04:15.630 --> 04:16.839
You're talking to a guy
who spent 17 years

04:16.923 --> 04:19.842
in service of his government,
all by the book.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.594
You know what the
sum total of it was?

04:21.678 --> 04:23.638
Nothing. Nada.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.098
But we're very similar, Michael,

04:25.181 --> 04:26.516
and fundamentally,
we want the same thing.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.226
And I have a way to get it.

04:28.309 --> 04:29.602
How's that?

04:29.686 --> 04:30.895
I got a buyer for Scylla.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.731
A guy who wants to destroy
the Company as much as you do.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.984
And he's willing to pay
a lot of money for it.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.277
How much?

04:37.360 --> 04:40.738
Nine figures in an offshore
account of your choosing.

04:41.656 --> 04:42.865
So, there it is.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.117
Or...

04:44.200 --> 04:46.160
you could stand
by your principles.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.495
I'll pass.

04:48.579 --> 04:49.831
Look, I burned you, right?

04:49.914 --> 04:51.833
And I'd apologize,
but what's the point?

04:52.041 --> 04:53.710
We're all out in the cold now.

04:54.043 --> 04:56.045
But we're not going to be
able to hide from the Company

04:56.129 --> 04:57.171
on a shoestring budget.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.172
Who's the buyer?

04:58.256 --> 04:59.966
He's an ex-Company guy
with a bone to pick.

05:00.049 --> 05:01.718
Just like your father.

05:02.677 --> 05:03.678
Michael?

05:05.555 --> 05:07.140
I'd need to
meet him first.

05:07.348 --> 05:08.516
That can be arranged.

05:08.599 --> 05:10.310
And just so you know, this...

05:10.518 --> 05:12.562
This wasn't personal.
This is just business.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.188
We'll be in touch.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.499
We stick to the plan, all right?

05:33.583 --> 05:34.834
We're going to get Scylla.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.045
We wait for Alex to
come through on his end.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.963
All right?

05:57.440 --> 05:59.108
Hello, Alex.

06:00.651 --> 06:01.778
You came.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.780
I always do,

06:03.863 --> 06:06.908
to the detriment
of my pay grade.

06:08.701 --> 06:09.911
These last few weeks,

06:09.994 --> 06:11.662
I've been part of an
off-the-books operation

06:11.746 --> 06:13.790
under the hand
of Homeland Security.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.751
Felicia, the people
I'm working with,

06:16.834 --> 06:18.544
we're this close
to coming up with

06:18.628 --> 06:19.962
the one thing that can
destroy the Company:

06:20.046 --> 06:23.424
their little black book.
We can get it. Names, numbers.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.928
Look, I don't want to get caught
up in some interagency politics.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.304
So, if this is
Homeland's show...

06:28.388 --> 06:31.599
Homeland buried the operation.
We can't come back in.

06:31.682 --> 06:33.518
But we could still
take the Company down.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.728
So, my question
to you is:

06:35.812 --> 06:37.647
Who do you know in the Bureau
that you can trust?

06:37.730 --> 06:39.982
It used to be you, Alex.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.611
I've lost a lot of things
these last few months,

06:43.694 --> 06:45.822
not the least of which
is your trust.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.116
But I don't come
to you hat in hand.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.993
Scylla is real.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.538
But if you don't want anything
to do with it, it's okay.

06:53.621 --> 06:56.541
It's all right;
I could walk away.

06:59.961 --> 07:04.757
Yeah, there is someone
who might be able to help.

07:08.052 --> 07:12.306
Sir, there are over ten
million faces in Los Angeles.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.976
Even with NSA and CIA satellite
links, we're going to be sifting

07:15.059 --> 07:17.478
through millions of
gigabytes of image data.

07:17.562 --> 07:18.938
The chances of
finding Don Self,

07:19.021 --> 07:21.274
Scofield and Burrows...
it's not good.

07:21.357 --> 07:22.483
Well, let's improve the odds.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.860
Self and
the brothers

07:23.943 --> 07:25.778
may have stolen Scylla
but none of them have

07:25.862 --> 07:27.530
the connections
to off-load it.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.825
Add Gretchen's face
to the search.

07:30.908 --> 07:33.494
She won't be welcome
in Scofield's camp.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.830
So, connect her image
with Self's.

07:35.913 --> 07:38.624
We find those two within
five feet of each other

07:38.708 --> 07:42.086
anywhere in Los Angeles,
and we've found Scylla.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.265
Are you friends with
my Auntie Gretchen?

07:55.725 --> 07:59.270
Go play in your room.
Mommy will be in soon.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.946
Where's her daddy?

08:10.490 --> 08:11.866
Gretchen doesn't
talk about him.

08:11.949 --> 08:15.369
So, Emily doesn't
know that you ain't...

08:15.453 --> 08:17.747
That Gretchen's her mama?

08:17.830 --> 08:20.666
No, and I'd like to
keep it that way.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.092
Cute girl.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.097
Don't hurt my little girl.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.809
If you have to do something,
do it to me.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.356
What do you think I am?

08:43.439 --> 08:44.982
A monster?

08:45.066 --> 08:47.818
You're holding us prisoner
in our own home.

08:47.902 --> 08:51.864
I'm just as much
a prisoner as you.

08:54.492 --> 08:58.454
Eggshell white.
Bold lettering.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.082
Double embossed.

To hell with it.
We are who we are, right?

09:25.481 --> 09:27.441
What were you selling?

09:27.525 --> 09:29.735
Never you mind.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.697
You just pray your
sister comes through.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.325
The Company gets destroyed
and we get paid.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.035
It's a great deal.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.162
This guy is just another General
Krantz waiting to happen.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.415
Let's say we do sell it
to him and the Company burns,

09:42.498 --> 09:43.833
You know what
happens then?

09:43.916 --> 09:47.461
Another company is built
right on top of that one.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.089
We're not selling.

10:02.810 --> 10:03.894
Sucre pulled it off.

10:04.645 --> 10:05.771
Great.

10:24.790 --> 10:25.875
Is this
going to work?

10:25.958 --> 10:27.168
It's like
an ultrasound.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.045
It can see
through everything.

10:44.435 --> 10:45.978
You're building up
a tolerance.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.230
Then we'll up the dosage.

10:48.814 --> 10:49.815
Yeah, I have,

10:49.899 --> 10:51.442
and at this point,
a higher dosage would have

10:51.525 --> 10:53.736
more side effects
than the tumor itself.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.363
I'll manage without it.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.285
and never came back.

15:11.368 --> 15:12.578
That's right.

15:12.661 --> 15:15.789
And I think that if you don't
like this mean man,

15:15.873 --> 15:18.751
then very soon,
he's going to leave

15:18.834 --> 15:21.295
and he's never coming back.

15:21.378 --> 15:23.088
You think so?

15:23.172 --> 15:24.131
Baby, I know so.

15:24.214 --> 15:26.091
All right, that's enough.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.636
Emily, baby, put the mean man
back on the phone.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.016
Listen to me.
I'm going to call you

15:34.099 --> 15:35.726
in two hours with the exact
location of the exchange.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.227
If you don't hear from me,

15:37.311 --> 15:38.687
kill them both.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.411
You expecting somebody?

15:55.329 --> 15:56.664
No.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.756
Look lively.

16:05.839 --> 16:07.633
Hey, buttercup,
why don't you

16:07.716 --> 16:09.093
go play with your
dollsies or something.

16:09.176 --> 16:12.346
It's okay, honey.
Go to your playroom.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.062
Hi, there.

16:20.145 --> 16:22.189
My name is Ralph Becker,
and I'm selling Bibles

16:22.272 --> 16:24.441
to raise money for the
Church of the Holy Trinity.

16:24.525 --> 16:25.943
And I wonder if I
could spend five minutes

16:26.026 --> 16:28.028
of your time and talk
about the Gospel with you.

16:28.112 --> 16:32.408
We're a bit, uh, indisposed
at the moment, Ralph.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.701
Can you come back tomorrow?

16:33.784 --> 16:36.453
Well, actually, today is the
last day of the fund-raiser.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.788
I said we're busy.

16:37.871 --> 16:40.457
We're never too busy for God.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.126
And what's
a few minutes

16:42.209 --> 16:44.169
of your afternoon
for a place in His kingdom?

16:44.253 --> 16:48.757
You're a bit pushy for a Bible
salesman, ain't you, friend?

16:48.841 --> 16:51.552
I'm on a mission.

16:51.635 --> 16:54.972
Yeah, I bet you're on a mission,
all right.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.100
What are you doing?!
Close the door!

16:59.184 --> 17:00.769
This guy is Company!
What company?!

17:00.853 --> 17:01.812
Get me some rope
to tie him up with.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.480
This guy is a Bible salesman.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.649
Get me the rope, now!

17:34.928 --> 17:37.890
Good choice for a
meeting spot, Alex.

17:37.973 --> 17:39.975
Crowded place.
Two exits.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.020
Corner table with a
full view of the room.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.689
Looks like you're getting
acclimated to life on the run.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.487
I hear you got promoted.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.072
Your own field
office.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.199
That's impressive.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.868
When you're neither
a disgrace to the Bureau

17:57.951 --> 18:00.245
nor a drug addict,
good things can happen.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.288
He's clean, Mark.

18:01.371 --> 18:02.498
Thank you, Felicia.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.625
Look, I know
you, Mark.

18:04.708 --> 18:05.793
You're a good
agent, ambitious.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.252
So, let me appeal
to the side of you

18:07.336 --> 18:08.837
that likes to see
your name in print.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.799
Want to be on a short list
for Deputy Director? Huh?

18:11.882 --> 18:14.384
Right. Lang filled me in.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.012
You've got solid gold intel.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.057
I don't know if I'm more
skeptical of a burned out ex-Fed

18:20.140 --> 18:23.018
or the mythical cabal
known as the Company.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.687
You came all the way
here for a myth?

18:28.607 --> 18:30.567
What do you want, Alex?

18:30.651 --> 18:33.237
Felicia tells me you have
the attorney general's ear.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.404
That's right.

18:34.488 --> 18:38.575
The Bureau is compromised.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.411
Homeland Security
is compromised.

18:41.495 --> 18:44.373
I need someone I can trust.
Can I trust you?

18:50.671 --> 18:55.134
You get me credible intelligence
against the Company...

18:55.217 --> 18:56.969
I'll walk you into the

18:57.052 --> 18:59.847
attorney general's
office myself.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.184
We'll get it.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.825
Alex, talk to me.

19:19.908 --> 19:22.244
I think I found someone
in government we can trust.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.121
How close are you
to getting Scylla?

19:24.204 --> 19:25.289
Very.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.373
Michael...

19:26.456 --> 19:27.457
We're in escrow here.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.126
You've got to come through
with the house.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.460
Don't worry.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.171
We're getting Scylla.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.965
All right.

19:35.674 --> 19:36.884
Look what I found.

19:36.967 --> 19:39.636
But we have no way
to shoot them.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.187
Yeah, we do.

19:48.270 --> 19:52.357
But I need you to buy
some hair spray and a lighter.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.499
What's this?

20:09.583 --> 20:11.376
My resignation.

20:14.129 --> 20:16.798
Lisa, I tried to shield you
from everything

20:16.882 --> 20:17.966
I didn't think
you could handle.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.510
The only thing you
shielded me from

20:20.594 --> 20:22.262
was knowing who you really are.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.390
Now I know.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.269
I wanted a son.

20:30.103 --> 20:33.190
Sir...

20:33.273 --> 20:35.150
Taken less than
an hour ago.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.779
You were right--
Gretchen's with Self.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.578
Your mission is the safe
retrieval of Scylla.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.038
What are the rules
of engagement?

20:48.121 --> 20:49.539
There are none.
Shoot on sight.

20:49.623 --> 20:52.793
Flauntleroy Hotel. Downtown.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.640
Who sent you?!

21:06.807 --> 21:08.183
The Church of The Holy Trinity.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.309
Liar!

21:09.476 --> 21:10.978
Are you out of your mind?!

21:11.061 --> 21:12.104
You're beating up

21:12.187 --> 21:13.230
a Bible salesman!

21:13.313 --> 21:14.314
I ain't Scofield.

21:14.398 --> 21:15.399
I ain't Burrows.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.858
This ain't my lot!
Leave me alone!

21:16.942 --> 21:18.610
I'm not a part of this

21:18.735 --> 21:19.736
company!

21:19.987 --> 21:21.238
I don't know anything,
I swear.

21:21.321 --> 21:22.614
Look at him! Please, please,
just look at him!

21:22.698 --> 21:23.991
Does he look
like some kind

21:24.074 --> 21:25.617
of a undercover agent to you?!

21:25.742 --> 21:26.952
They blend in!

21:27.035 --> 21:28.245
That's how
they get you!

21:28.328 --> 21:29.663
Look at this, okay,
his wallet, okay?

21:29.746 --> 21:31.164
He's got a California
driver's license.

21:31.248 --> 21:32.291
"Ralph Becker," okay?

21:32.416 --> 21:34.751
He's got a library card
and a prayer card.

21:34.835 --> 21:35.919
That is pretty convincing.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.045
Look at this.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.588
"Freedom, Honor, Country.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.757
Southeastern Military Academy,
Class of '98."

21:40.841 --> 21:43.677
How many Bible salesman
do you know graduate

21:43.760 --> 21:45.220
from a military
academy?!

21:45.345 --> 21:48.557
No! I didn't go to Southeastern!
It's my kid brother's ring!

21:48.640 --> 21:50.767
He died in Baghdad
last year!

21:51.143 --> 21:53.061
It was a car bomb!

21:53.478 --> 21:55.981
I swear!

21:56.231 --> 21:57.858
Listen to me.

21:58.191 --> 21:59.151
Please.

21:59.234 --> 22:00.819
That made sense.

22:00.944 --> 22:02.070
Okay...

22:02.404 --> 22:05.157
That made sense.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.325
Please!

22:11.997 --> 22:13.540
We're not going nowhere!

22:13.915 --> 22:15.625
Not till I get a phone call!

22:26.053 --> 22:27.888
It's $25 for the hour.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.515
We don't need a room.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.017
I, uh, I'm looking
for my sister.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.310
Her name's Gretchen Morgan.

22:33.393 --> 22:34.686
Can you tell me
what room she's in?

22:34.770 --> 22:36.897
You want information,
call 411.

22:42.611 --> 22:43.653
How about now?

22:46.615 --> 22:48.116
No Gretchen Morgan.

22:49.242 --> 22:50.494
No refund.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.871
She's about five-seven.

22:52.954 --> 22:54.289
She's got black hair
and blue eyes,

22:54.373 --> 22:55.874
and I imagine she'd stand out

22:55.957 --> 22:57.459
in a fine establishment
like this one.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.468
Room 308.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.470
Thank you so much.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.975
No urinating in the stairwell.

23:14.976 --> 23:16.186
That's the golden rule.

23:19.523 --> 23:20.857
Yeah?

23:21.358 --> 23:22.692
Yeah, they're on
the third floor,

23:22.776 --> 23:23.902
front of the hotel,

23:23.985 --> 23:25.445
just to the left
of center.

23:26.613 --> 23:27.781
Got it, thanks.

23:27.906 --> 23:28.907
Yeah.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.784
Third floor up, just
left of the balcony.

23:33.703 --> 23:35.789
Why don't you set up on
that rooftop over there?

23:42.129 --> 23:43.255
Scylla's almost complete.

23:43.338 --> 23:44.589
Is everything
ready on your end?

23:44.673 --> 23:45.924
Let me talk to Gretchen.

23:46.007 --> 23:47.467
No, you're talking to me.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.636
The buyer has touched down.

23:49.803 --> 23:51.680
This isn't the kind of person
you keep waiting.

23:51.763 --> 23:52.639
Likewise.

23:52.722 --> 23:54.057
Just make sure he has
the money ready.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.225
Listen to me, you mook.

23:55.308 --> 23:56.977
You're in the deep end
of the pool now.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.812
At least act like you can swim.

23:58.895 --> 24:00.897
And the next time I call,
I want to talk to Gretchen.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.482
No, no, no,
you listen to me, okay?

24:02.566 --> 24:04.109
The next time you call,
it better be

24:04.192 --> 24:06.194
to tell me that the money's
ready, you understand?

24:10.365 --> 24:11.366
Hello.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.534
I thought you should know

24:12.617 --> 24:15.120
a man and a woman
came in looking for you.

24:15.203 --> 24:16.913
Scofield found us.
How?

24:16.997 --> 24:18.081
Who cares? Just get ready.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.249
How long ago?

24:19.332 --> 24:20.417
A couple of minutes.

24:27.174 --> 24:30.385
I don't want
no trouble in my place!

25:19.726 --> 25:20.936
I'm gonna recon
the hallway.

25:21.019 --> 25:22.771
Anything goes down,
get Scylla, get out.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.189
I will find you.

25:24.272 --> 25:25.398
Okay.

27:04.664 --> 27:06.333
♪ ♪

27:31.858 --> 27:33.610
Go, go, go, go! Go!

28:23.702 --> 28:27.080
Like I said before,
this is just business.

28:30.083 --> 28:32.127
Don't move!

28:32.794 --> 28:34.129
Get in!

28:48.935 --> 28:51.855
Help me get him
in the back of the van!

29:01.573 --> 29:03.366
Michael!

29:19.799 --> 29:20.925
What is that?

29:21.009 --> 29:23.470
It's the warehouse.

29:24.637 --> 29:26.055
The chip.

29:33.646 --> 29:35.398
You sure it's here?

29:35.482 --> 29:36.399
Yeah, I'm sure.

29:36.483 --> 29:40.069
From the schematic,
it can only be in one place.

30:04.010 --> 30:07.096
Look, don't be stupid,
okay, Gretchen?

30:07.180 --> 30:10.725
You're gonna get your daughter
back and your money.

30:10.809 --> 30:14.437
I'll see you
in the car.

30:28.993 --> 30:30.620
He was brought
in like this.

30:30.703 --> 30:32.455
Who's there?

30:34.415 --> 30:36.000
I'm giving him 10cc's
of clonazepam

30:36.084 --> 30:38.419
and taking him downstairs.
We'll know more soon.

30:45.593 --> 30:47.595
Try and relax.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.666
Don't worry, we're gonna
get Michael back.

31:16.749 --> 31:18.167
-How?
-Self took the piece.

31:18.251 --> 31:19.836
We got nothing
to trade for Michael.

31:19.919 --> 31:21.504
He's sick, Lincoln.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.923
If they haven't killed
him already...

31:24.007 --> 31:27.343
We'll get him back, I promise.

31:28.595 --> 31:31.180
Hello.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.434
Hold on.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.019
It's Alex.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.521
Yeah.

31:38.605 --> 31:39.647
Did you get it yet?

31:39.731 --> 31:41.816
No, Self's got it.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.484
All of it.

31:44.485 --> 31:45.987
What?

31:46.070 --> 31:47.572
Just forget about Scylla.

31:47.655 --> 31:49.157
The Company's taken Michael.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.577
Your friend in government--
can he do anything for him?

31:52.660 --> 31:54.621
No, I don't think so.

31:57.206 --> 31:59.584
There's no reason
for you to come back, Alex.

32:00.376 --> 32:01.502
I'm sorry.

32:03.963 --> 32:05.506
Yeah, me, too.

32:16.809 --> 32:18.102
Should have known.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.460
Vikan's meeting us here?

33:25.586 --> 33:27.338
We'll be off the
Company's radar here.

33:31.759 --> 33:32.760
Yeah.

33:32.885 --> 33:34.137
We got a problem.

33:34.262 --> 33:35.471
Well, whatever it is,
it can wait.

33:35.555 --> 33:36.514
We're in the home stretch here.

33:36.597 --> 33:37.724
Grab the sister
and the girl.

33:37.807 --> 33:38.891
I'm going to call you back

33:38.975 --> 33:40.309
with the exact location
of the exchange.

33:40.393 --> 33:42.020
I'd love to, but a, uh...

33:42.603 --> 33:45.356
third party has been introduced
into the mix.

33:45.773 --> 33:47.150
Who?

33:47.233 --> 33:48.234
I'm not sure yet.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.820
He might be a Company operative.

33:51.029 --> 33:51.946
So kill him.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.699
He could also be
a Bible salesman.

33:54.824 --> 33:56.034
Then he should have
no problem

33:56.117 --> 33:57.660
getting past St. Peter.
Kill him.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.168
Go back in the playroom

34:05.251 --> 34:06.753
-with your daughter.
-What are you going to do?

34:06.836 --> 34:08.212
Go now!

34:16.888 --> 34:19.098
Please... please,
please don't kill me.

34:19.724 --> 34:20.975
Please don't kill me.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.810
Please...
Look, I won't tell anyone!

34:22.894 --> 34:24.937
I won't tell anyone,
I promise!

34:25.021 --> 34:26.147
Please don't kill me!

34:26.606 --> 34:28.149
I swear I won't tell anyone.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.111
Don't do this.

34:32.195 --> 34:34.072
I told you to go
back yonder, okay?

34:34.155 --> 34:35.656
You don't want to see this!

34:37.200 --> 34:39.202
Cole Pfeiffer
wouldn't do this.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.205
Cole Pfeiffer
ain't here no more.

34:42.497 --> 34:44.248
Just ol' T-Bag.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.585
Our Father, who art in Heaven

34:47.668 --> 34:49.212
hallowed
be thy name...

34:49.295 --> 34:51.881
You want to be free?

34:52.090 --> 34:53.257
Start now.

34:53.591 --> 34:54.634
Right this minute.

34:55.802 --> 34:57.011
If you pull
that trigger...

34:57.345 --> 34:59.138
Cole Pfeiffer is gone forever.

35:00.973 --> 35:02.558
Don't do this.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.230
Don't do this.

35:15.196 --> 35:18.116
You know, my daddy was
a religious man, too, Ralph,

35:18.199 --> 35:19.283
just like you.

35:19.367 --> 35:23.121
We used to... pray together

35:23.204 --> 35:24.872
in my room at night.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.208
I used to go down
to the floor crying

35:27.291 --> 35:28.960
just like you now.

35:31.712 --> 35:33.464
Sometimes when I just
couldn't take it no more,

35:33.548 --> 35:35.716
my daddy would recite
a particular piece

35:35.800 --> 35:38.261
of Scripture that
he was fond of...

35:38.344 --> 35:39.804
"Weeping

35:39.887 --> 35:44.517
may endure through the night..."

35:44.600 --> 35:47.145
"But joy cometh in the morning."

35:47.228 --> 35:49.063
Psalms 30:5.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.056
Rita...

36:24.140 --> 36:25.141
Yeah?

36:25.224 --> 36:26.893
Have you got a car?

36:26.976 --> 36:30.313
My car's in the...
it's in the garage.

36:30.396 --> 36:31.856
You get in that car right now

36:31.939 --> 36:33.816
and you drive far, far away
from right here,

36:33.900 --> 36:35.067
right now, okay?

36:35.151 --> 36:36.360
Here.

36:36.444 --> 36:37.987
Take this.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.116
Rita...

36:44.202 --> 36:46.746
Thank you.

36:50.958 --> 36:53.252
What are you going to do to me?

37:00.218 --> 37:01.219
I want you to go.

37:01.302 --> 37:03.471
I want you to be free.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.433
Be as free as me.

37:07.516 --> 37:09.185
Thank you.

37:10.561 --> 37:12.230
Thank you so much.

37:28.663 --> 37:30.414
Yeah, I got one.

37:30.498 --> 37:33.542
Not Gretchen.
It's Bagwell.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.962
I'm bringing him in.

37:38.881 --> 37:41.592
The growth is malignant.

37:41.676 --> 37:42.969
It's pushing up against
his temporal lobe

37:43.052 --> 37:45.263
and it will kill him
if it's not removed.

37:45.346 --> 37:46.305
Have you seen

37:46.389 --> 37:48.057
anything like this before?

37:48.140 --> 37:49.100
This advanced?

37:49.183 --> 37:51.185
Once.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.062
Sir...

37:53.145 --> 37:56.857
you'll never guess
who just came through the door.

38:04.407 --> 38:06.200
I want to see my brother.

38:17.003 --> 38:17.920
Thank you, gentlemen.

38:18.004 --> 38:23.009
Mr. Burrows, won't be a
problem... will you?

38:25.761 --> 38:28.139
This started with me.
It ends with me.

38:28.222 --> 38:29.223
Let Michael go.

38:29.307 --> 38:32.059
I think you made
the right decision.

38:32.143 --> 38:35.021
Let's go downstairs
and see your brother.

38:57.251 --> 38:59.003
Gretchen.

38:59.086 --> 39:04.175
Don... this better be
the real thing this time.

39:04.258 --> 39:05.259
It's all here.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.552
Well, no offense,

39:06.635 --> 39:08.095
but I'll check it myself.

39:13.476 --> 39:16.020
So the buyer's
on the way?

39:16.812 --> 39:19.732
He will be here shortly.

39:19.815 --> 39:21.859
And he's bringing
the money?

39:21.942 --> 39:25.613
Yes, Don, he is
bringing the money.

39:31.452 --> 39:34.455
Scylla is complete.

39:34.538 --> 39:37.958
Gretchen, you did it.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.753
What I wouldn't give to see

39:40.836 --> 39:42.463
the look on the General's face.

39:45.758 --> 39:46.967
What the hell
are you doing?!

39:47.051 --> 39:49.303
We need him alive
to sell this thing!

39:49.387 --> 39:50.721
You heard what he said.

39:50.805 --> 39:52.515
Buyer's already on the way.

39:52.598 --> 39:54.350
You think I'm going
to give this clown 30%

39:54.433 --> 39:56.143
for just making
introductions?

40:01.273 --> 40:03.317
Come on, how could you
miss it-- it's a glass door!

40:04.985 --> 40:06.570
Okay, I hear you.

40:06.654 --> 40:08.114
We'll be right out.

40:33.722 --> 40:34.890
Well?

40:37.226 --> 40:40.896
The attorney general
is willing to hear you out.

40:42.356 --> 40:45.067
You know, from where
I'm sitting, it looked like...

40:45.151 --> 40:49.238
Your flight to Dulles
leaves in 45 minutes.

40:58.873 --> 41:00.332
Can I trust this guy?

41:03.794 --> 41:05.463
We better go.

41:24.148 --> 41:26.317
Come on, Alex, short
trip to the airport.

41:28.944 --> 41:30.821
Attorney general's
waiting.

41:42.583 --> 41:43.834
There is no meeting

41:43.918 --> 41:45.336
with the attorney general,
is there?

42:01.435 --> 42:02.686
Thank you, Felicia.

42:03.604 --> 42:05.314
For everything
you've done.

42:06.232 --> 42:07.358
Everything.

42:19.495 --> 42:20.871
What did you do
to my brother?

42:21.163 --> 42:23.541
Michael needs an operation
to remove a tumor

42:23.624 --> 42:26.335
from his temporal lobe,
and he needs it now.

42:26.418 --> 42:28.212
The Company can provide

42:28.295 --> 42:30.965
such an operation
at a cost.

42:31.048 --> 42:32.716
What do you want from us?

42:32.800 --> 42:34.009
Not "us," Lincoln...

42:34.093 --> 42:35.469
you.

42:35.928 --> 42:37.429
The price
of the operation

42:37.513 --> 42:38.847
is the safe return of Scylla.

42:39.181 --> 42:41.225
You bring back to me
what you stole,

42:41.850 --> 42:45.062
and I will make sure Michael
gets the finest medical care

42:45.145 --> 42:46.105
in the world.

42:46.313 --> 42:48.857
The Company has science
and technology

42:48.941 --> 42:51.944
that's years ahead of anything
available to the public.

42:52.027 --> 42:53.195
And it's all right here--

42:53.279 --> 42:54.488
in this facility.

42:54.947 --> 42:56.782
Now, I would imagine

42:56.865 --> 43:00.202
that working for me would be
difficult for you to accept.

43:02.913 --> 43:04.039
What's this?

43:04.415 --> 43:06.667
Added incentive.
