Previously on ER:

00:05.530 --> 00:06.730
The Medical Board called me.

00:06.950 --> 00:07.990
I bet they did.

00:08.039 --> 00:11.040
They said they're issuing a letter for
us to cease and desist our **ug
program.

00:11.140 --> 00:15.400
Dr**Pratt is under arrest for violation
of The Controlled Substance Act.

Call your husband.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.060
Call him.

00:40.100 --> 00:42.060
I just called him. He didn't pick up.

00:42.460 --> 00:43.540
Shh.

00:44.420 --> 00:45.450

00:46.290 --> 00:47.490

Sammy,you smell that?

01:49.530 --> 01:50.230

02:09.020 --> 02:11.910

02:13.970 --> 02:14.930
Wait,Meg...

02:14.990 --> 02:16.650
She got dizzy and pulled over.

02:16.680 --> 02:17.600
What happened? Meg,Meg?

02:17.640 --> 02:19.790
Stridorous resps! Let's lie her down!

02:20.470 --> 02:22.130
What'd you take,Meg?

02:22.220 --> 02:24.220
- It's definitely E.T.o.H.

02:22.220 --> 02:24.220
- **Bunch of stuff...

02:24.220 --> 02:25.870

02:29.300 --> 02:31.010

02:32.030 --> 02:33.280
Alprazol**?

02:33.670 --> 02:34.670
Oh...

02:34.740 --> 02:35.910

02:35.910 --> 02:37.030
What is this?

02:38.450 --> 02:39.650
Amitrptylene.

02:39.650 --> 02:40.690
That's her pick-me-up medicine.

02:40.740 --> 02:42.750
It's a tricyclic. She needs a cardiac
monitor.

02:42.790 --> 02:44.560
How long have you been on the
anti-depressants,huh?

02:44.600 --> 02:46.580
There shou** be a lot more pills in
here.

02:47.150 --> 02:48.860
- Great.

02:47.150 --> 02:48.860
- Roll her.

02:50.690 --> 02:53.160
Hold on,Meg. Hold on.

02:53.550 --> 02:55.990
There is no need for this. He hasn't
broken any law.

02:56.040 --> 02:58.390
You'll be able to post bail for him in
a few hours. Sit tight.

02:58.430 --> 03:00.270
Look,this is not a criminal matter.

03:00.330 --> 03:01.550
It's just a misunderstanding.

03:01.580 --> 03:03.030
Yeah,never heard that one.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.800
Hey,uh,sorry,I couldn't pick up before.

03:06.870 --> 03:08.390
I'm at the police station.

03:08.390 --> 03:10.590
- Are you okay?

03:08.390 --> 03:10.590
- Luka...

03:10.590 --> 03:12.070
Can you come home now?

03:12.130 --> 03:14.670
No,it's probably going to be a couple
of hours. Pratt's been arrested.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.850
You need to come home now.

03:16.930 --> 03:17.880
What's wrong?

03:17.920 --> 03:19.510
Nothing,I just...

03:20.390 --> 03:23.040
Just something happened and we need to
discuss it.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.050
Is Joe okay?

03:24.100 --> 03:25.430
He's fine. Just come home.

03:25.470 --> 03:26.970
Okay,tell me what's the matter.

03:27.210 --> 03:28.960
I need to see you.

03:29.560 --> 03:32.320
Okay,I'll-I'll be right there.

03:38.940 --> 03:40.530
Thank you.

03:42.820 --> 03:45.190
I appreciate that.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.610
Hurry up!

04:10.690 --> 04:13.920
Move away from the building so our
people can work!

04:13.920 --> 04:15.880
Where's Sammy? Where's Alex?

04:15.990 --> 04:17.730
We should all...stay together.

04:17.730 --> 04:18.640
She went inside to go get him.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.300
They've got to be outside by now.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.380
They're,they're still inside?

04:22.440 --> 04:23.960
No,no,they must be around here
somewhere.

04:24.150 --> 04:25.260
- Where are they?

04:24.150 --> 04:25.260
- If you can walk...

04:25.260 --> 04:28.460
If you can walk,head to an ambulance to
be assessed.

04:28.460 --> 04:32.650
- sammy

04:28.460 --> 04:32.650
- Command,give me EMS plus one at 1215
Granger Avenue.

04:32.720 --> 04:37.190
Ale** That's my granddaughter,Sam
Taggart!

04:42.410 --> 04:43.770
******How's he doing?

04:44.190 --> 04:45.390
Who?

04:47.060 --> 04:48.720
Joe.

04:51.050 --> 04:53.160
****He's fine.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.570
**Please?

05:00.530 --> 05:02.500
My daughter was easy.

05:02.570 --> 05:06.750
My little boy,I told you,he was always
colicky.

05:06.800 --> 05:09.580
*Didn't sleep through the night for the
firs**three months.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.240
How about Joe?

05:13.410 --> 05:15.370
He sleeps fine.

05:16.610 --> 05:18.850
He grew big since the park.

05:18.900 --> 05:19.590
They grow up fast...

05:19.640 --> 05:21.960
** Look,what do you want?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.280
**I want to talk t**Luka.

05:23.340 --> 05:25.870
Like this?

05:26.880 --> 05:29.090
This happened to the both of us,

05:29.160 --> 05:30.730
him and me,

05:30.800 --> 05:33.910
so I see no reason why we should go
throu** it alone.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.890
**It's over.

05:36.850 --> 05:39.340
Is that what you think?

05:43.110 --> 05:46.570
You're the successful doctor,right?

05:47.110 --> 05:50.610
You're smart,you're beautiful

05:50.610 --> 05:53.910
you got the man you got the baby,you
got everything.

05:56.240 --> 06:04.550
So don't take ** personal when I say to
you you have no idea where I am right
now.

06:06.590 --> 06:09.160
You're wrong.

06:10.070 --> 06:13.210
- Yeah.

06:10.070 --> 06:13.210
- You think so?

06:13.210 --> 06:16.970
I think I know exactly where you are
right now.

06:20.750 --> 06:24.330
** You know,nine yea** ago,I had...

06:26.790 --> 06:32.380
my marriage was over,my mother was in a
mental institution for the seventh or
tenth time.

06:32.450 --> 06:35.870
I don't know. And I drank a lot.

06:35.930 --> 06:38.970
A lot.

06:39.210 --> 06:42.430
And I had reached this... You know
what?

06:42.460 --> 06:48.070
One morning I woke up in this apartment
and I had no idea how I got there,

06:48.810 --> 06:51.670
next to some guy I didn't even remember
meeting,

06:51.720 --> 06:57.350
and he was going through my stuff
looking for money so he and his buddy
could get a fix.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.520
So I ran out of there **and I went
downstairs

07:01.370 --> 07:03.420
and I tried to get a cab,but I had no
idea where I was

07:03.480 --> 07:07.450
and it was 5:00 in the morning and
there were no cars on the street,so I
j**t...

07:08.740 --> 07:14.530
I just sat down on a stoop and I just,I
waited **r something to happen.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.820
And at that moment,I'm telling you,

07:18.870 --> 07:22.710
I knew,I mean,I was positive

07:24.010 --> 07:27.810
that happiness was something I was
never going to find.

07:29.330 --> 07:30.780
You getting deep on me now?

07:30.850 --> 07:32.650
No.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.160
I am just trying to tell you that
things can change.

07:36.220 --> 07:39.670
They can get better,even if you don't
see it,they can.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.710
Do you have any bourbon?

08:13.750 --> 08:15.420
Dr. Gates,lo time,no see.

08:15.490 --> 08:16.710
Suction and intubation.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.160

08:18.210 --> 08:19.230
Guess Jenny didn't tell you it was me.

08:19.310 --> 08:20.100
Thanks for coming.

08:20.170 --> 08:21.190
Why do you think we took our time?

08:21.240 --> 08:22.390
This lady's pretty messed up,huh?

08:22.440 --> 08:23.140
It's Meg.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.610
Hey,I'm sorry,man,I didn't know.

08:26.150 --> 08:27.760
Are you going to give her medicine?

08:27.810 --> 08:28.960
Take Sarah to the rig.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.020

08:30.060 --> 08:31.260

08:42.070 --> 08:43.960
We're gonna place a tube down your
throat.

08:44.049 --> 08:46.700
It's gonna help you breathe,okay?

08:46.760 --> 08:49.000

08:58.700 --> 09:02.710
She's yours.

You don't belong here,huh?

09:32.330 --> 09:33.990
No.

09:34.050 --> 09:35.480
Do you?

09:35.510 --> 09:37.590

09:37.640 --> 09:39.180
It's complicated,man.

09:39.240 --> 09:42.020
So now you calling me stupid?

09:45.380 --> 09:48.410
I helped some people get some
medications they needed.

Medications?

09:49.880 --> 09:51.590

It's been too long,Ben.

10:14.350 --> 10:15.400
Where are they?

10:15.450 --> 10:18.440
Maybe she went out a back way,Gracie,or
they went up to the roof,okay?

10:18.490 --> 10:19.460
Would you ask 'em again?

10:19.510 --> 10:20.150
Ask 'em!

10:20.150 --> 10:22.570
Okay.

10:22.810 --> 10:25.880

Hey! Hey,up here!

10:34.660 --> 10:39.110
I got a little boy and a man with
intensive burns!

10:39.420 --> 10:40.730

Let me take care of your cut.

10:47.820 --> 10:48.740

11:00.940 --> 11:03.060
You come back when you clean up that

Burns to face,chest and arms.

11:04.450 --> 11:05.040
Pulse ox?

11:05.110 --> 11:06.320
Below 90. He's getting stridorous.

He needs a line. Chem

11:09.170 --> 11:11.050
He's my neighbor. He slept through
everything.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.530
Hey,Mr. Owens,you're gonna be okay.

11:12.570 --> 11:13.820
How'd this thing get started?

11:13.870 --> 11:16.510
Uh,I'm not sure. Alex said
he,uh,knocked over a candle.

11:16.580 --> 11:17.750
Have somebody look at that,all right?

11:17.820 --> 11:21.090
Let's get him exposed and check the
airway!

Hey,sorry it took me so long. The
traffic was...

11:36.890 --> 11:41.350
Hey,hey. I got fired.

11:44.550 --> 11:46.420
What are you doing here?

11:46.470 --> 11:49.640
You said if ever I needed anything,I
should give you a call.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.330
So...

11:51.380 --> 11:52.800
this is my call.

11:52.870 --> 11:55.600
Okay. What do you need?

11:55.650 --> 11:59.520
To talk,to be listened to.

11:59.570 --> 12:01.570
Abby,take the baby upstairs.

12:01.620 --> 12:02.500
No,need for that.

12:02.500 --> 12:06.060
Hey,Curtis... Take the baby up**airs.

12:06.110 --> 12:10.060
It can stay right here 'cause we going
for a ride.

12:10.060 --> 12:11.570
- No,don't.

12:10.060 --> 12:11.570
- All right,okay.

12:11.570 --> 12:13.410
No,it's okay.

12:13.490 --> 12:14.500
My car's right around the corner.

12:14.540 --> 12:16.110
No,please,come on. Please,don't do
this.

12:16.190 --> 12:19.660
- Abby,Abby...

12:16.190 --> 12:19.660
- Luka,don't go. You can't go.

12:28.810 --> 12:34.730
Abby... thanks for the talk.

12:48.870 --> 12:50.280
911 operator.

12:50.360 --> 12:53.830
Um,uh,there was a man in my apartment
with a gun and he,

12:53.930 --> 12:57.520
he's taken my husband. His name is
Curtis Ames.

12:57.580 --> 12:59.080
I can't find a pulse.

12:59.080 --> 12:59.710
V- fib.

12:59.770 --> 13:02.670
- Charge to 360,amp of epi and bicarb.

12:59.770 --> 13:02.670
- Starting compressions.

13:02.670 --> 13:04.690
Charged. Let 'em know we're in full
arrest.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.650
Back off,back off.

13:06.770 --> 13:08.550
Clear.

13:08.600 --> 13:09.450
Still in fib.

13:09.540 --> 13:11.340
All right,we're going to take your mom
in the ambulance.

13:11.390 --> 13:12.640
You go with Neela in the car.

13:12.700 --> 13:13.720
No,I want to stay with you.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.670
- I want to stay with you!

13:13.720 --> 13:15.670
- Sarah,please,I need you to do this.

13:15.910 --> 13:17.780
Go with Neela,please.

13:15.910 --> 13:17.780
We're going to follow them all the
way...

13:17.780 --> 13:20.420
- No...

13:17.780 --> 13:20.420
- Sarah,go with Neela now!

13:21.390 --> 13:25.020
Just go straight.

13:26.390 --> 13:30.690
I can help you find another job if
that's the problem.

13:37.310 --> 13:40.200
Look,do you need money? I have money.

13:40.250 --> 13:43.140
Just turn right right over here.

13:43.210 --> 13:44.780
Come on,talk to me,Ames.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.430
I thought that's what you wanted.

13:46.510 --> 13:50.170
Just... pull up here.

13:50.170 --> 13:54.330
Park it,turn off the lights.

13:54.580 --> 13:56.630
- No.

13:54.580 --> 13:56.630
- You have no idea how he got in?

13:56.630 --> 13:58.080
Look,why aren't you looking for him?

13:58.160 --> 13:59.780
I told them I saw the car.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.660
'96 station wagon,light tan?

14:01.720 --> 14:02.610
I think so,yeah.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.930
We ran a check,he's got one registered
to him. We're already on it.

14:04.980 --> 14:08.020
Okay,so you know his history - Ames?

14:08.090 --> 14:09.890
You know,I told the cops this!

14:09.890 --> 14:12.860
He... he had a stroke,he lost the use
of his left arm.

14:12.910 --> 14:14.460
There was a lawsuit.

14:14.530 --> 14:17.490
Okay,I'll get somebody on that right
away.

14:17.550 --> 14:18.730
Okay...

14:18.790 --> 14:21.140
um,Louise,could you take him to your
place for a little while?

14:21.210 --> 14:24.090
- Thanks.

14:21.210 --> 14:24.090
- Sure,Abby. We'll be fine.

14:25.050 --> 14:26.680
Listen,you need to catch up.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.040
There's a medical record with all kinds
of information on it-

14:29.090 --> 14:31.560
numbers,addresses,there's probably even
a psych assessment.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.790
- County General. I can get it.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.790
- Where?

14:33.790 --> 14:35.420
Mr. Owens,you doing okay?

14:35.460 --> 14:36.540
Throw me a cordis,I'll go central.

14:36.590 --> 14:39.180
We don't want to do a subclavian
through this eschar.

14:39.240 --> 14:42.630
The fire... it started downstairs.

14:42.690 --> 14:43.560
Femoral?

14:43.600 --> 14:44.690
Too much infection risk.

14:44.750 --> 14:45.750
In my apartment.

14:45.830 --> 14:46.810
How?

14:46.840 --> 14:48.120
I'm not sure.

14:48.180 --> 14:51.170
Proximal arm is spared.

14:51.770 --> 14:54.220
I think it was a candle.

14:54.290 --> 14:55.770
I am so sorry.

14:55.770 --> 14:59.780
Give me the ultrasound. I'll cannulate
the basilic vein.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.800
Can't we give him something for the
pain?

15:02.870 --> 15:03.790
There it is.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.540
All right,morphine,five milligrams IV.

15:06.590 --> 15:08.110
Look,his nasal hairs are singed.

15:08.210 --> 15:10.010
- No,no,no,not enough time.

15:08.210 --> 15:10.010
- Should we go fiber optic?

15:10.080 --> 15:14.470
We got to get in before it closes.

15:10.080 --> 15:14.470
His airway's already swollen.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.190
She's going to be okay,isn't she?

15:26.240 --> 15:28.160
Tony's going to fix her.

15:28.230 --> 15:32.040
Your mom took too much of a medicine
that can be bad for the heart.

15:32.100 --> 15:35.610
They're trying to get it started again.

15:36.620 --> 15:39.720
Tony can fix her.

15:40.860 --> 15:42.810
Can't see the cords- there's too much
edema.

15:42.880 --> 15:43.830
Pulse ox 78.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.400
Help me out,Ray,we don't want to crike
this guy.

15:45.460 --> 15:46.620
I know. I'm working on it.

15:46.620 --> 15:48.370
You need more pressure?

15:48.490 --> 15:50.660
No,no,anatomy's too distorted.

15:50.740 --> 15:52.760
Okay,damn it,let's go,crike tray.

15:52.830 --> 15:53.950
Wait,wait,hold on.

15:54.010 --> 15:56.350
Sat's down to 70.

15:56.430 --> 15:59.450
Watch carefully,okay? Look for bubbles.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.920
This will force the air back up the
trachea.

16:03.010 --> 16:04.950
The bubbles will show you where to
place the tube.

16:05.060 --> 16:06.390
That works?

16:06.440 --> 16:07.900
Once in awhile.

16:07.970 --> 16:10.400
Wow,that's really good. I can see it.

16:10.500 --> 16:14.840
- All right,bag him.

16:10.500 --> 16:14.840
- Well,push that baby home.

16:17.770 --> 16:19.740
You got it,we're in.

16:19.820 --> 16:20.890
Color change.

16:20.950 --> 16:22.290
Sam is the man.

16:22.290 --> 16:24.610
Mr. Owens,take it easy,okay?

16:24.690 --> 16:27.360
We're taking real good care of you.

16:28.980 --> 16:31.390
Ben went to find her some clothes.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.950
Mr. Owens all right?

16:34.050 --> 16:35.620
Uh,yeah,I think he's going to be.

16:35.680 --> 16:36.630
He's a nice man.

16:36.690 --> 16:38.390
He helped me with the groceries the
other day.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.910
But he drinks too much.

16:40.980 --> 16:43.430
What happened tonight,Sammy?

16:43.520 --> 16:45.120
Uh...

16:45.180 --> 16:46.160
what did Alex say?

16:46.210 --> 16:47.040
Nothing.

16:47.170 --> 16:49.530
Won't talk to me.

16:49.630 --> 16:52.250
Well,I don't know what happened.

16:52.310 --> 16:56.850
If it is what I think,it scares the
hell out of me.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.810
I heard the cops took Pratt on the long
walk of shame.

17:00.870 --> 17:02.410
If they did,they got it wrong,okay?

17:02.480 --> 17:04.099
Pratt's as good as they come.

17:04.150 --> 17:05.380
Get away from my desk.

17:05.450 --> 17:06.670
Sorry,man,I was just asking.

17:06.670 --> 17:08.790
- Keep it to yourself.

17:06.670 --> 17:08.790
- Frank...

17:08.790 --> 17:10.369
Hey,you're either a little late or very
early...

17:10.430 --> 17:13.400
Frank,I need you to cal up to
records,tell them to pull Curtis Ames'
chart.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.180
- Just do it.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.180
- Curtis Ames? Kovac's guy?

17:15.450 --> 17:19.480
- Frank,just do it!

17:15.450 --> 17:19.480
- You know,this late,I don't know if...

17:28.810 --> 17:30.560
Who lives here,Curtis?

17:30.650 --> 17:33.050
Quiet. Shh,shh.

17:38.890 --> 17:42.460
I've had a gun pointed at me before.

17:42.550 --> 17:45.830
I know you're not the type of man to
use that.

17:48.270 --> 17:50.530
You see?

17:50.630 --> 17:53.380
I used it.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.310
There's Cheryl- there she is.

18:04.380 --> 18:06.470
Remember Cheryl?

18:09.920 --> 18:12.800
She remarried in October.

18:13.230 --> 18:16.350
Banker.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.660
Investments or something. I- I don't...

18:18.740 --> 18:21.850
I don't know about that kind of stuff.

18:22.180 --> 18:23.790
But my...

18:23.860 --> 18:27.460
my daughter's recital was tonight.

18:27.610 --> 18:31.650
They asked me not to come this time.

18:31.720 --> 18:35.760
Said we would try rotating.

18:38.560 --> 18:42.220
You know,at the movies last week,

18:42.620 --> 18:49.870
they wanted to know if it would be okay
with me if they called this new guy...

18:50.160 --> 18:52.410
dad.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.370
I mean,they would still call me that,

18:55.470 --> 19:01.360
but they just wanted to know if it was
okay if they called this new guy
that,too.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.760
I know she put them up to it.

19:03.840 --> 19:07.090
Know she put them up to it.

19:07.150 --> 19:10.180
I know she...

19:19.310 --> 19:22.250
But...

19:22.300 --> 19:26.410
the fact is...

19:27.530 --> 19:31.730
I think they like the idea.

19:31.780 --> 19:33.730
They're just confused. You can...

19:33.800 --> 19:37.390
you can help them understand.

19:41.890 --> 19:46.500
Pretty soon,they'll be going to bed.

19:48.190 --> 19:50.840
He's goi** to be screwing my wife

19:50.840 --> 19:57.640
with my children sleeping in the next
room.

20:04.760 --> 20:11.570
She gets to... to move on.

20:11.870 --> 20:16.940
She gets to... be happy.

20:23.900 --> 20:27.680
Guys like you and me...

20:28.150 --> 20:31.830
we got to live with it.

20:34.470 --> 20:36.730
She's gone,man.

20:36.810 --> 20:40.740
There's nothing else we can do.

20:42.640 --> 20:45.090
Please give me a little more time.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.320
Can you spare the room?

20:46.430 --> 20:49.350
Of course.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.750
Take what you need.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.240
Another round of epi and bicarb.

20:55.290 --> 20:59.170
Coming up.

21:06.030 --> 21:09.690
Sarah,you want to talk to your mom?

21:09.760 --> 21:13.570
Is her heart beating now?

21:13.650 --> 21:17.720
We're giving her more medicine,so...

21:18.300 --> 21:21.700
Is she getting better?

21:21.800 --> 21:26.650
I don't know.

21:26.730 --> 21:29.800
Can she hear me?

21:30.960 --> 21:35.700
I'm sure she'd like to hear your voice,

21:35.760 --> 21:39.400
know that you're here with her.

21:40.050 --> 21:43.870
Is she going to die?

21:59.240 --> 22:01.930
Mom...

22:03.030 --> 22:06.710
Mom,I'm here.

22:08.870 --> 22:12.140
I'm sorry you're sick.

22:12.200 --> 22:16.420
And I'm sorry that you've been so sad.

22:16.500 --> 22:19.960
And I'm sorry if I've been a
pain,but,Mom,

22:20.050 --> 22:23.500
you've got to fight now,okay?

22:24.050 --> 22:27.090
You always said we were survivors.

22:27.170 --> 22:31.810
Didn't you say that?

22:32.290 --> 22:36.740
So,please,Mommy,Please.

22:36.790 --> 22:40.590
You've got to survive this.

22:40.700 --> 22:43.350
I know you can do it.

22:43.440 --> 22:49.640
I know you can do it!

22:53.910 --> 22:56.310
Thanks for bailing me out. I'll make
sure you get your money right back.

22:56.310 --> 22:57.450
Greg...

22:57.600 --> 22:58.810
I told you to shut it down.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.580
Why didn't you do that?

23:00.620 --> 23:01.840
Because the day hadn't come yet.

23:01.900 --> 23:03.650
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

23:03.700 --> 23:05.390
Let me tell you about my favorite
prophet.

23:05.440 --> 23:06.970
This about your bookie again?

23:06.990 --> 23:11.090
Isaiah knew the day would come when the
spirit of God would unburden the
brokenhearted,

23:11.170 --> 23:12.420
give strength to the meek

23:12.510 --> 23:14.640
and open the prisons so the captives
could go free.

23:14.710 --> 23:19.440
You sound like the love child of David
Koresh and Al Sharp**n,you realize
that,right?

23:19.510 --> 23:22.730
Greg,you're looking for something.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.560
I could see that the first time you
walked into my church.

23:26.850 --> 23:29.070
You needed to feel like you belonged to
a family.

23:29.130 --> 23:33.110
Well,we are your family.

23:33.110 --> 23:35.520
You know,Isaiah's all fine,

23:35.590 --> 23:39.120
but I prefer the one about the prodigal
son.

23:39.180 --> 23:42.780
Even he came back eventually.

23:42.850 --> 23:45.790
Don't hold your breath.

23:48.200 --> 23:52.180
Sarah,we've been working on your mom
and giving her medicine for over an
hour now.

23:52.180 --> 23:54.250
-Fix her.

23:52.180 --> 23:54.250
-It's not working.

23:54.250 --> 23:58.360
That's why you wanted to be a doctor,so
you could fix people.

23:58.450 --> 24:01.470
Sometimes you can't fix people if
they've taken...

24:01.560 --> 24:02.910
Shut up!

24:02.910 --> 24:06.080
Go away! Why are you even here? We
don't want you here!

24:06.180 --> 24:11.680
She doesn't want you here! We don't
want you!

24:19.310 --> 24:24.240
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

24:31.120 --> 24:34.830
Now I'm going to s**p CPR.

24:34.930 --> 24:40.390
If her heartbeat comes back,it's good.

24:40.480 --> 24:47.730
but if it doesn't,that means your mom
has died.

24:50.320 --> 24:57.020
Are you ready?

25:10.270 --> 25:12.280
No,Tony...

25:12.370 --> 25:15.560
No,you can't let this happen,Tony!

25:15.640 --> 25:16.900
No!

25:16.970 --> 25:18.030
Come on,Mom!

25:18.090 --> 25:19.360
You've got to wake up!

25:19.440 --> 25:24.910
You got to wake up!

25:25.010 --> 25:26.540
No!

25:26.610 --> 25:29.160
Mom,you've got to wake up!

25:41.470 --> 25:46.670
Tony,you have to do something!

25:49.230 --> 25:54.940
Mom...

26:05.250 --> 26:08.180
Tony...

26:15.800 --> 26:17.180
Okay.

26:17.260 --> 26:20.390
Okay,let's go.

26:20.480 --> 26:23.140
Curtis,please,just tell me,what are we
doing?

26:23.220 --> 26:24.540
You're gonna like this.

26:24.600 --> 26:27.530
I'm gonna show you something that's
really beautiful,all right?

26:27.530 --> 26:29.370
Let's go. Let's go.

26:29.430 --> 26:31.790
Come on. Come on.

26:53.350 --> 26:57.280
I should have said that this,this,uh,

26:57.350 --> 27:01.050
this could've been beautiful,right?

27:01.130 --> 27:03.640
Is this yours?

27:03.760 --> 27:07.330
Was.

27:07.430 --> 27:10.420
I bought it four years ago.

27:10.510 --> 27:15.120
I figured we'd live on the bottom two
floors

27:15.180 --> 27:17.550
and we'll rent out the top.

27:17.620 --> 27:22.380
Started working on it,fixing**t up.

27:22.480 --> 27:27.130
My own two hands.

27:28.320 --> 27:34.220
Those spindles on the staircase.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.960
Yeah,that's-that's...

27:36.050 --> 27:37.770
that's me.

27:37.860 --> 27:41.910
The paneling...

27:42.350 --> 27:47.520
it took me two months before I had to
stop.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.900
You still own it?

27:50.960 --> 27:56.530
I held on to it even after everything
that happened.

27:58.820 --> 28:02.120
I tried to keep working on it,

28:02.200 --> 28:06.660
but it just took me so long.

28:06.740 --> 28:12.920
You know,I couldn't be as detailed as I
used to be.

28:13.890 --> 28:22.880
I gave Cheryl half the market value in
the divorce.

28:23.580 --> 28:30.010
You know,it was stupid because I don't
know why I didn't just sell it.

28:31.800 --> 28:36.360
Now the bank owns it.

28:45.530 --> 28:49.130
There was a time where...

28:49.220 --> 28:57.640
I thought that we,we understood each
other,

28:57.710 --> 29:00.930
where we were,where we were...

29:00.990 --> 29:05.440
we were hearing each other.

29:06.050 --> 29:10.960
You know,like that time up by the
river.

29:11.010 --> 29:16.770
You were just,you were just
talking,weren't you?

29:16.830 --> 29:20.000
Because you never really felt me.

29:20.060 --> 29:21.460
I don't know what else you expected.

29:21.520 --> 29:26.270
I don't know what you want. Tell me
what you want.

29:26.370 --> 29:31.990
Are you a righty or are you a lefty?

29:32.060 --> 29:34.550
Why?

29:34.610 --> 29:36.610
I'm right-handed,I'm right-handed.

29:36.680 --> 29:37.950
Why?

29:38.010 --> 29:39.950
I want you to...

29:40.000 --> 29:44.110
put your hand in that vise there.

29:44.180 --> 29:49.450
I want you to feel that.

29:49.500 --> 29:51.330
No.

29:51.380 --> 29:52.900
Do it.

29:52.950 --> 29:54.260
Look,Curtis...

29:54.340 --> 29:56.200
look,you're confused.

29:56.280 --> 30:00.960
I know you're upset...

30:04.970 --> 30:09.210
Do... it.

30:16.730 --> 30:18.800
Tighten it.

30:18.870 --> 30:20.930
Curtis,look...

30:21.000 --> 30:24.360
Tighten it.

31:03.620 --> 31:10.910
Report sighting of suspect's vehicle
outside a residence formerly owned by
suspect located at 321 Parkdale.

31:10.980 --> 31:12.640
You guys get over there,help secure the
scene.

31:12.710 --> 31:13.970
I'm going to go pick up Mrs. Ames.

31:14.050 --> 31:15.360
Did they find them?

31:15.440 --> 31:16.600
Not yet,just the car.

31:16.670 --> 31:18.550
All right,I'm going with you.

31:18.660 --> 31:20.140
That's 321 Parkdale.

31:20.210 --> 31:21.170
Possible shots fired.

31:21.240 --> 31:24.270
The best thing for you is to stay put
until we have more information.

31:24.340 --> 31:25.560
Did she say "shots fired"?

31:25.630 --> 31:26.700
I know this can't be easy.

31:26.740 --> 31:27.910
No. No,no!

31:27.910 --> 31:30.270
- Are you kidding me?

31:27.910 --> 31:30.270
- I'll send an officer back. He'll stay
with you,you'll be apprised...

31:30.270 --> 31:32.250
- I'm sorry.

31:30.270 --> 31:32.250
- I'm not just going to wait here.

31:32.300 --> 31:36.910
You need to trust us now.

32:19.380 --> 32:25.740
It hurts,doesn't it?

32:30.110 --> 32:34.580
Don't be so easy on yourself!

32:39.390 --> 32:43.960
Tell me how it feels.

32:45.040 --> 32:50.580
Tell me,tell me what it's... what it's
doing to you.

32:51.860 --> 32:54.740
I can,uh...

32:54.830 --> 32:58.760
I can feel,uh...

32:58.820 --> 33:03.250
crushing of the metacarpal heads.

33:03.340 --> 33:05.500
Uh...

33:05.530 --> 33:09.320
the digital nerves being compressed...

33:09.650 --> 33:11.250
I'm losing...

33:11.310 --> 33:13.620
sensation...

33:13.720 --> 33:16.310
uh,motor control.

33:16.390 --> 33:17.540
You know what I mean.

33:17.600 --> 33:18.690
You know what I mean?

33:18.760 --> 33:21.210
I don't.

33:21.210 --> 33:24.810
- I don't! I don't! Wait,wait,wait.
Hey,hey...

33:21.210 --> 33:24.810
- You know what I mean.

33:24.880 --> 33:26.150
Stop,please.

33:26.150 --> 33:34.590
- Just stop it.

33:26.150 --> 33:34.590
- You tell me how it feels!

33:34.670 --> 33:36.150
Come on,Luka!

33:36.220 --> 33:37.490
Come on!

33:37.550 --> 33:40.490
You see people in pain every day!

33:40.560 --> 33:42.440
You tell me how it feels!

33:42.500 --> 33:48.240
Oh,son of a bitch.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.350
So do you...

33:51.420 --> 33:54.840
do you feel me now?

33:54.920 --> 33:56.100
What do you want from me,huh?

33:56.200 --> 33:59.790
What do you want from me!

34:09.489 --> 34:13.320
I can't...

34:13.370 --> 34:15.610
do it without my hands.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.020
I'm a doctor.

34:17.230 --> 34:21.409
I have a wife,a child.

34:22.389 --> 34:23.900
It's hard,right?

34:23.969 --> 34:25.790
Is that what you want,huh?

34:25.880 --> 34:29.830
Is that what you want?

34:29.889 --> 34:34.409
I won't be able to take care of my
family.

34:34.480 --> 34:36.610
I won't be able to do anything.

34:36.690 --> 34:37.830
I'm nothing,okay?

34:37.889 --> 34:40.010
I'm nothing!

34:40.090 --> 34:41.380
You want to kill me?

34:41.460 --> 34:42.960
Is that what you want? You want to kill
me?

34:42.960 --> 34:44.690
- Now you get it!

34:42.960 --> 34:44.690
- Kill me now!

34:44.690 --> 34:46.940
Now you're saying something!

34:47.010 --> 34:52.090
Now you finally understand a little!

34:52.560 --> 34:55.120
Get the hell out of here!

34:55.179 --> 34:58.110
This is my house!

35:23.580 --> 35:25.630
- I've got to somebody.

35:23.580 --> 35:25.630
- Hey! Get back here!

35:25.630 --> 35:29.430
- I got to talk to somebody. I know
him. I work at...

35:25.630 --> 35:29.430
- What?

35:29.630 --> 35:32.190
- Hey! Hey! I work at County!

35:29.630 --> 35:32.190
- Boss.

35:32.190 --> 35:35.770
- Look,let her go.

35:32.190 --> 35:35.770
- I know Curtis Ames.

35:35.830 --> 35:37.230
I brought his medical record.

35:37.290 --> 35:39.260
It's the reason why he's doing this.

35:39.310 --> 35:40.310
There's a lot of information...

35:40.390 --> 35:41.340
Who are you again?

35:41.420 --> 35:43.140
That's my husband in there with him.

35:43.220 --> 35:43.990
- Yes.

35:43.220 --> 35:43.990
- Your husband?

35:43.990 --> 35:47.480
We both work at County and I thought
that maybe your negotiator could use...

35:47.550 --> 35:50.940
Yeah,move in.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.730
No,look.

35:52.830 --> 35:53.700
Thanks.

35:53.800 --> 35:57.210
I don't think this is gonna help.

36:01.250 --> 36:03.820
46-45 clear.

36:03.890 --> 36:04.480
Somebody was here.

36:04.550 --> 36:07.620
Signs of a struggle.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.830
Command,this is Chopper One.

36:17.900 --> 36:18.930
We got two men on the roof.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.620
One of them is armed.

36:20.690 --> 36:23.410
All right,I want that **chopper to back
off.

36:23.530 --> 36:28.900
Tell the pilot to get some altitude
now.

36:30.160 --> 36:32.710
Look,does Kovac have a cell phone with
him.

36:32.790 --> 36:36.030
I tried to call him before,but he
didn't answer.

36:36.120 --> 36:38.510
What does he want?

36:38.590 --> 36:39.510
I mean,what does he want?

36:39.570 --> 36:43.230
If he wanted to kill Luka,he could have
shot him an hour ago.

36:43.310 --> 36:46.450
Maybe he wanted a bigger audience.

36:46.540 --> 36:47.940
46-25 Charlie.

36:48.010 --> 36:49.680
What's your status?

36:49.750 --> 36:51.870
Securing second floor.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.980
Curtis,it's time to let this go.

36:54.040 --> 36:57.250
The hospital said it.

36:57.340 --> 37:00.210
The court said it.

37:00.300 --> 37:02.820
My damn lawyers said it.

37:02.910 --> 37:07.150
Even my own wife.

37:07.220 --> 37:09.420
"Curtis,let it go.

37:09.490 --> 37:14.490
Let it go.

37:14.950 --> 37:22.460
" You know what it's like to lose
everything.

37:23.420 --> 37:25.850
It's not just about the arm.

37:25.940 --> 37:36.670
It's about feeling like everything that
ever made you a man has been taken
away.

37:37.380 --> 37:42.580
How are you supposed to fix that?

37:42.660 --> 37:51.280
How am I supposed to just let this go?

37:51.350 --> 37:54.930
Hey.

37:54.960 --> 38:00.800
It's just probably them again,Curtis.

38:10.420 --> 38:12.250
Yeah,this is Kovac.

38:12.340 --> 38:14.430
We're both here.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.440
Yeah,hold on.

38:16.510 --> 38:17.160
It's the police.

38:17.260 --> 38:20.340
They want to talk to you.

38:20.340 --> 38:25.180
Just put it on... on speaker.

38:26.200 --> 38:30.780
Mr. Ames,this is Deputy Superintendent
John Valentine.

38:30.870 --> 38:34.530
we'd like to resolve this quickly and
peacefully,so first off,

38:34.600 --> 38:36.320
is there anything we can get you?

38:36.400 --> 38:41.230
Yeah,could you just go away?

38:41.290 --> 38:44.720
Can you just leave me alone?

38:44.790 --> 38:46.270
Just go... Just go over there.

38:46.350 --> 38:48.540
Just get over there.

38:48.620 --> 38:51.550
Curtis,we both have families.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.060
Children we love.

38:53.110 --> 38:55.060
A lot to live for.

38:55.140 --> 38:56.790
This won't solve anything.

38:56.850 --> 38:58.790
Mr. Ames...

38:58.870 --> 39:01.800
The numbness happened twice.

39:01.850 --> 39:03.730
So it was TIA,right?

39:03.810 --> 39:06.750
Yes!

39:03.810 --> 39:06.750
Right?

39:07.110 --> 39:10.170
You should have considered that!

39:07.110 --> 39:10.170
Well,you didn't consider that.

39:10.230 --> 39:12.350
i thought it was from sleeping on the
gurney.

39:12.420 --> 39:14.070
We've been through all this.

39:14.150 --> 39:18.850
Intermittent numbness is associated
with TIA.

39:18.920 --> 39:22.030
You should've considered that. You
should have thought about my heart.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.690
It was noisy,I explained that.

39:24.770 --> 39:27.480
That's 'cause you listened**ith a
steth.

39:27.560 --> 39:30.330
But the standard of care,would have
been a cardiac echo.

39:30.450 --> 39:31.200
It doesn't matter.

39:31.240 --> 39:33.300
It does!

39:33.380 --> 39:36.240
It does!

39:36.320 --> 39:38.460
Because...

39:38.550 --> 39:44.650
you would have seen the patent foramen
ovale.

39:44.710 --> 39:47.260
And you would have pulled the central
line!

39:47.330 --> 39:50.390
yes!ok yes yes...

39:50.450 --> 39:52.080
You're right.

39:52.160 --> 39:53.230
You're right all along.

39:53.300 --> 39:54.940
I blew it. I missed it.

39:55.010 --> 39:57.160
I missed the murmur.

39:57.230 --> 40:00.680
I'm sorry for that.

40:01.190 --> 40:07.400
Why didn't you ever just say that,man?

40:07.480 --> 40:10.580
I'm saying it now,okay?

40:10.630 --> 40:13.700
Maybe I needed all this to...

40:13.700 --> 40:16.640
I... I'm not innocent.

40:16.730 --> 40:18.240
I'm just...

40:18.320 --> 40:21.330
Look,if I can take it **all back,if I
can fix it...

40:21.410 --> 40:22.590
but I can't. Okay?

40:22.660 --> 40:30.080
I can't. I just can't. I can't.

40:35.340 --> 40:36.830
Luka...

40:36.900 --> 40:39.360
Mr. Ames?

40:39.420 --> 40:43.050
Mr. Ames.

40:58.830 --> 41:03.220
Curtis...

41:15.070 --> 41:16.070
Who fired?

41:16.140 --> 41:17.700
There was no command to fire.

41:17.700 --> 41:20.100
Not us. It came from the roof.

41:20.170 --> 41:21.240
Grab her!

41:21.240 --> 41:25.020
- Go! Go! Go!

41:21.240 --> 41:25.020
- No! Let me go!

41:32.190 --> 41:34.390
All units,I want status reports now.

41:34.470 --> 41:37.290
2-5 Charlie,we have a man down. We have
a man down.

41:37.290 --> 41:39.570
Oh,God. Oh,no. You have to let me go.

41:39.630 --> 41:40.760
Listen,I'm an ER doc.

41:40.830 --> 41:43.580
Just let me go...
