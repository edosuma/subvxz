WEBVTT

00:01.796 --> 00:04.025
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

00:04.145 --> 00:07.580
No, babe. Are you ready?

00:07.614 --> 00:08.290
Yes?

00:08.410 --> 00:10.330
I got fired from running
the Sweetums Foundation.

00:10.404 --> 00:11.956
Thanks to me.
Sorry, again.

00:12.081 --> 00:14.099
Hey, blessing in disguise.

00:14.150 --> 00:15.684
I took a job
at this accounting firm,

00:15.718 --> 00:18.119
they've tried to hire me
three times, I finally gave in.

00:18.137 --> 00:20.722
But I've had a week off
in between jobs,

00:20.756 --> 00:23.375
and I've been cooking up
something pretty big.

00:23.426 --> 00:25.610
The last time
he was in between jobs,

00:25.645 --> 00:27.595
he got deep into claymation,

00:27.613 --> 00:31.383
so this should be different,
hopefully.

00:31.434 --> 00:34.119
Presenting
"The Cones of Dunshire,"

00:34.153 --> 00:38.223
a brand-new gaming experience.
8 to 12 players.

00:38.274 --> 00:41.276
Two wizards, a Maverick,
the arbiter, two warriors,

00:41.310 --> 00:42.978
a corporal, and a ledgerman.

00:43.012 --> 00:44.696
Now, the ledgerman
just keeps score,

00:44.730 --> 00:46.998
and he wears this hat.

00:47.049 --> 00:48.082
Oh, boy.

00:48.100 --> 00:49.818
Now, the object
is to accumulate cones.

00:49.852 --> 00:52.254
Four cones wins,
but in order to get a cone,

00:52.288 --> 00:54.356
you have to build
a civilization.

00:54.390 --> 00:57.325
The other amazing thing
is the challenge play.

00:57.360 --> 00:59.261
Actually, let me tell you
more about the trivia cards,

00:59.295 --> 01:01.129
'cause you're gonna need to know
about roadblocks first.

01:01.163 --> 01:03.031
Nah, never mind. The thing
about the challenge play

01:03.065 --> 01:06.434
is that it's basically
the game...in reverse.

01:06.469 --> 01:09.020
Then you roll three dice to see
how many dice you roll with.

01:09.071 --> 01:10.956
Oh, 16.
Perfect, lots of choices.

01:11.007 --> 01:13.859
Okay, each turn goes:
Roll, buy, action.

01:13.893 --> 01:15.944
I mean, obviously, this would be
much taller in the real game.

01:15.978 --> 01:17.829
But the corporal can veto.

01:17.864 --> 01:19.297
This should be green too.
How did this happen?

01:19.332 --> 01:21.416
Are the cones a metaphor?
Well, yes and no.

01:21.450 --> 01:24.169
- What is this called again?
- "The Cones of Dunshire."

01:24.203 --> 01:26.221
Oh, my God, the Maverick should

01:26.255 --> 01:28.190
be able to trade lumber
for agriculture credits.

01:28.224 --> 01:32.127
How have I not
thought of this before?

01:32.161 --> 01:33.211
This is nothing, right?

01:33.262 --> 01:34.846
When do you go
back to work again?

01:34.881 --> 01:35.881
Tomorrow. It's fine.

01:35.915 --> 01:36.882
I'll just throw this
in the garbage.

01:39.852 --> 01:50.795
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:56.935 --> 01:58.336
As soon as Knope is gone,

01:58.387 --> 02:00.572
these are going up
all over Chambers.

02:00.606 --> 02:02.123
Jamm for three!

02:02.158 --> 02:03.324
Ha ha! What,
are you trying to build a house

02:03.342 --> 02:04.960
with those bricks?

02:04.994 --> 02:06.861
Ooh!
The girl is attacking me.

02:06.896 --> 02:08.930
Any new business
before we adjourn?

02:08.965 --> 02:10.431
Yes, I have one--

02:10.466 --> 02:11.399
the Pawnee Commons.

02:11.434 --> 02:12.617
Oh, boy.

02:12.652 --> 02:13.932
The money
for the Pawnee Commons,

02:13.953 --> 02:16.021
aka the greatest future park
in the world,

02:16.055 --> 02:17.355
aka my personal dream project...

02:17.390 --> 02:19.241
Aka...

02:19.275 --> 02:21.760
Is currently
in a discretionary fund.

02:21.811 --> 02:23.211
I'd like to move it
to a lockbox,

02:23.229 --> 02:25.163
to ensure that it is used
for that project.

02:25.197 --> 02:27.716
The thing is, Leslie,
this kind of decision is--

02:27.750 --> 02:29.434
it's not really up
to you anymore.

02:29.468 --> 02:32.820
Because the voters, to use
a technical political term,

02:32.838 --> 02:34.556
gave you the stanky boot.

02:34.590 --> 02:36.658
But we'll keep your money safe,
baby girl.

02:36.692 --> 02:37.826
What, you think
I'm gonna use it

02:37.860 --> 02:39.544
to put a new limestone shower
in my office?

02:39.578 --> 02:41.179
Yeah, now I do.

02:41.230 --> 02:42.714
I propose that
we table this discussion

02:42.748 --> 02:45.300
until, let's say,
the second Knope is gone.

02:45.334 --> 02:47.001
Later, bunheads.

02:47.019 --> 02:48.186
Glass!

02:49.822 --> 02:51.890
Video Ron demand.

02:51.924 --> 02:53.207
What you carrying, my dude?

02:53.225 --> 02:55.660
The time has come
to sell my cabin.

02:55.695 --> 02:57.662
But I haven't had much luck
finding a buyer.

02:57.713 --> 02:59.264
"For sale. Small house.

02:59.298 --> 03:00.899
Location: Forest."

03:00.933 --> 03:02.483
It's a little wordy,
don't you think?

03:02.501 --> 03:03.668
"Current owner will not
clean up

03:03.703 --> 03:07.388
shotgun shells
or animal carcasses."

03:07.406 --> 03:08.907
The hell is wrong with you,
Swanson?

03:08.941 --> 03:10.375
Fine, I'll clean up
the shotgun shells,

03:10.409 --> 03:12.994
but the carcasses remain
to fertilize my berry patch.

03:13.029 --> 03:15.030
If you really want to unload
that little horror cabin,

03:15.064 --> 03:17.515
you gonna need a professional
to stage it properly.

03:17.550 --> 03:22.153
Lucky for you, I recently
got my real estate license.

03:22.188 --> 03:23.771
Spladow!

03:23.789 --> 03:24.772
Check it.

03:24.790 --> 03:26.591
"Regal Meagle Realty."

03:26.642 --> 03:29.394
"Find your castle."

03:29.445 --> 03:32.013
Fine, I suppose
I could use some help.

03:32.048 --> 03:33.348
Yo, Donna,
let me get a little skin

03:33.382 --> 03:34.766
in the game,
maybe split that commission?

03:34.800 --> 03:36.121
All right.
Show me what you got.

03:36.135 --> 03:37.485
I'll split that commish.

03:37.503 --> 03:39.704
â™ª Split that commish

03:39.755 --> 03:41.639
The question I always
ask myself is,

03:41.674 --> 03:43.325
what kind of mogul should I be?

03:43.359 --> 03:45.627
Fashion mogul,
energy drink mogul.

03:45.661 --> 03:47.462
I even thought
about downhill skiing.

03:47.496 --> 03:48.496
A mogul mogul.

03:48.530 --> 03:50.682
But a real estate mogul?

03:50.733 --> 03:51.733
Hmm.

03:51.767 --> 03:54.052
That's a hot mogul right now.

03:54.086 --> 03:56.137
Ben Wyatt, reporting for duty.

03:56.172 --> 03:57.639
How you doing, Barney?
Good to see you again.

03:57.673 --> 04:00.942
I just can't believe
it's finally happening.

04:02.144 --> 04:03.762
Dad! He's here!

04:03.796 --> 04:05.580
He really came!

04:05.598 --> 04:07.232
Hello, Ben. I'm Frank.

04:07.266 --> 04:09.701
I took the job
when you passed it up last time.

04:09.752 --> 04:10.719
Heard a lot about you.

04:10.753 --> 04:12.587
Well, all good things, I hope.

04:12.605 --> 04:13.721
A little too good.

04:13.739 --> 04:15.223
Let's see if you live up
to the hype.

04:16.509 --> 04:18.176
I'm not joking.

04:18.209 --> 04:19.560
Oh.

04:19.595 --> 04:22.096
Frank seems cool.

04:22.130 --> 04:24.115
Well, tell everybody
in Michigan I said hi,

04:24.150 --> 04:26.384
and tell your mom that
I love the banana cake

04:26.435 --> 04:27.402
she posted on Pinterest.

04:27.436 --> 04:29.204
Oh, the father of your child
is here.

04:29.238 --> 04:30.488
I have to go.
I'll talk to you soon.

04:30.523 --> 04:31.806
- I love you.
- Was that Ann?

04:31.841 --> 04:33.641
I hope you were speaking
to her in a calming voice

04:33.676 --> 04:35.193
'cause babies can hear
everything.

04:35.244 --> 04:37.779
Baby, if you can still hear me,
I love you.

04:37.797 --> 04:39.447
- The phone is hung up.
- Oh.

04:39.482 --> 04:42.383
You got my message
about Jamm being a dinkhead?

04:42.401 --> 04:44.969
Yes, but as city manager,
I can't play sides.

04:45.004 --> 04:46.004
And I think
all of our heads can be

04:46.055 --> 04:47.555
a little dinky at times.

04:47.590 --> 04:49.107
Fine, but his is the dinkiest.

04:49.141 --> 04:51.025
And I would know
because I'm keeping score.

04:51.043 --> 04:53.044
Ever since
I started city council,

04:53.095 --> 04:56.064
I have gone head-to-head
with Jamm 112 times.

04:56.098 --> 04:59.084
He has won 56 times,
I have won 56 times.

04:59.135 --> 05:02.270
I will not lose
our last battle.

05:02.304 --> 05:06.207
Will you help me?

05:06.242 --> 05:07.559
No.

05:07.593 --> 05:08.593
Oh.

05:08.644 --> 05:09.761
The way you stood up like that,

05:09.812 --> 05:11.112
I thought it was gonna go
a different way.

05:11.146 --> 05:13.331
No, I can't help directly,
but I am on your side.

05:13.382 --> 05:16.317
And I will assist you
in any way that I can.

05:16.352 --> 05:18.186
Maybe I can mediate,
like Dr. Phil,

05:18.220 --> 05:21.656
only qualified.

05:21.674 --> 05:22.755
So what's the story, Ron?

05:22.758 --> 05:23.925
Diane making you sell
this place?

05:23.959 --> 05:24.926
Not at all.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.945
Recently, I purchased
a new cabin

05:26.979 --> 05:28.580
big enough
for the whole family.

05:28.614 --> 05:32.934
I just can't justify
owning four cabins.

05:32.968 --> 05:35.019
Two cabins.

05:35.070 --> 05:37.772
The new cabin I bought
has a great tire swing

05:37.807 --> 05:39.641
for the girls, access to a lake

05:39.675 --> 05:43.478
for all the kids to play in.

05:43.512 --> 05:45.513
Plus, it doesn't have
these razor-sharp

05:45.548 --> 05:48.633
perimeter defense planks
sticking out of the ground.

05:48.667 --> 05:51.536
I usually get a 5% commission,
but I'll do it for 3%.

05:51.570 --> 05:52.504
Friends and family discount.

05:52.538 --> 05:53.988
Make it 5%.

05:54.006 --> 05:56.641
I don't want you getting any
ideas about us being friends.

05:56.675 --> 05:58.309
- Respect.
- Donna, baby.

05:58.360 --> 06:00.528
For the fireplace,
I'm thinking fake antlers.

06:00.563 --> 06:02.130
But what kind of scarves
do we want to hang

06:02.164 --> 06:03.498
off the fake antlers?

06:03.532 --> 06:05.650
- Oh, duh. Crocheted.
- Most def.

06:05.684 --> 06:08.135
That'll look legit next to those
antique "Visit France" posters.

06:08.154 --> 06:10.488
Mm.

06:10.523 --> 06:11.873
Ron, you want to stay outside

06:11.907 --> 06:12.907
and do nothing while they make

06:12.925 --> 06:13.958
your cabin look like garbage?

06:14.009 --> 06:15.443
I'd like that very much.

06:15.478 --> 06:17.612
We can watch the shadows
get longer.

06:17.646 --> 06:19.247
Okay.

06:19.281 --> 06:21.049
Wow, you guys sure take

06:21.083 --> 06:23.268
the start-up paperwork
seriously around here.

06:23.302 --> 06:25.436
Sorry to start you out
like this,

06:25.488 --> 06:26.988
and on a Friday no less.

06:27.022 --> 06:28.957
But it's our toughest case.

06:28.991 --> 06:32.994
Three competing family trusts,
a contested will--

06:33.012 --> 06:36.347
it's a real puzzler!

06:36.398 --> 06:41.703
So let's see
what you got, genius.

06:41.737 --> 06:42.987
If I'm murdered tonight,

06:43.022 --> 06:46.140
start the investigation
with those two guys.

06:54.750 --> 06:56.117
The hell you nerds doing here?

06:56.151 --> 06:57.835
We're not done talking
about the lockbox.

06:57.870 --> 06:58.986
This isn't over.

06:59.004 --> 07:01.289
And I am here to mediate.

07:01.323 --> 07:03.208
You can't just show up
at my door like this.

07:03.259 --> 07:04.676
Look, I know we have had
our differences,

07:04.710 --> 07:06.094
but this is very important
to me.

07:06.128 --> 07:08.880
And I'm not leaving
until we hash this out.

07:08.931 --> 07:10.098
I respect the moxie, Knope.

07:10.132 --> 07:11.549
You can come in for a minute.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.851
Shoes off.
This is a house of respect.

07:13.886 --> 07:15.353
Well, I don't need to do that.
My feet are very clean.

07:15.387 --> 07:17.388
No shoes, you lose.

07:17.439 --> 07:18.856
"No shoes, you lose"?

07:18.891 --> 07:20.942
That means we should have shoes
then, right?

07:20.976 --> 07:23.878
No shoes...

07:23.913 --> 07:26.264
Hmm.

07:26.298 --> 07:28.950
Yeah, so this is
my weekend dojo.

07:28.984 --> 07:31.018
Sorry, the place
is a bit of a mess.

07:31.036 --> 07:32.987
My wife's in Oklahoma
for eight months.

07:33.021 --> 07:36.140
Maybe forever.
We'll see if she forgives me.

07:36.175 --> 07:38.826
- Who's that, Michelle Wie?
- It's not sexual.

07:38.860 --> 07:39.994
I'm just a really big fan
of her game.

07:40.028 --> 07:41.579
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:41.630 --> 07:43.631
Because in that picture,
she's wearing a bikini.

07:43.666 --> 07:46.050
Yeah, thanks.
Photoshopped it myself.

07:46.085 --> 07:47.051
Fantastic.

07:47.086 --> 07:48.052
Well, this is about the time

07:48.087 --> 07:49.470
I hit the hay, so...

07:49.505 --> 07:51.055
Why don't we all hit the hay?

07:51.090 --> 07:52.640
We'll stay here,
get a good night's sleep,

07:52.675 --> 07:54.676
and we can start negotiations
tomorrow.

07:54.710 --> 07:57.145
We stopped at the outlet mall
on the way here.

07:57.179 --> 08:01.015
Got ourselves a sleeping bag,
a giant tin of caramel corn,

08:01.049 --> 08:04.319
and an irregular skirt
from DKNY.

08:04.353 --> 08:06.053
The hem is crooked,
but it was 8 bucks.

08:06.071 --> 08:08.940
The point is, I am not leaving
until I get that lockbox.

08:08.991 --> 08:10.358
Oh, playing hardball, huh?

08:10.392 --> 08:11.993
Hey, no sweat off my sack.

08:12.027 --> 08:13.394
You can take the couch,

08:13.412 --> 08:15.246
if you can get
my exercise equipment

08:15.281 --> 08:18.232
out of the way.

08:18.250 --> 08:20.201
I think I can handle it.

08:27.467 --> 08:29.547
How sweet is this table,
by the way, huh?

08:29.952 --> 08:31.595
I got it
from an actual benihana.

08:31.715 --> 08:34.438
Cost me 4 grand.
Worth every penny.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.440
Hai!

08:35.491 --> 08:36.524
Can I interest anyone

08:36.542 --> 08:39.376
in an authentic
a-Japanese a-break-a-fast?

08:39.412 --> 08:41.813
Scrambled eggs eaten
with chopsticks? Okay.

08:41.847 --> 08:43.148
Hai!

08:43.198 --> 08:44.732
You know,
maybe we should negotiate

08:44.750 --> 08:46.251
- while we're eating.
- No, what's the rush?

08:46.302 --> 08:47.586
Plenty of time for that later.

08:47.637 --> 08:50.772
You know what might put you
in the mood to talk is

08:50.806 --> 08:52.490
a couple of brewskis

08:52.525 --> 08:55.243
and a calendar featuring

08:55.261 --> 08:56.845
some of your favorite
female wrestlers.

08:57.930 --> 08:59.748
Oh, yeah.

08:59.782 --> 09:01.449
Knope, you know the way
to a man's heart.

09:01.467 --> 09:02.851
Yeah, okay.
Let's talk.

09:02.885 --> 09:04.102
You got it.

09:04.136 --> 09:05.787
These people won't leave.

09:05.821 --> 09:07.855
One guy even looked
in the bathroom.

09:07.873 --> 09:09.457
Yeah, that means
they like the place.

09:09.491 --> 09:11.009
If you just leave them alone,

09:11.043 --> 09:12.927
I think we might get
some offers.

09:12.945 --> 09:14.195
This evergreen scented candle
should help put people

09:14.229 --> 09:15.614
in the mood to buy.

09:15.665 --> 09:17.048
You could just open the door

09:17.099 --> 09:19.067
and let the actual smell
of the pines in.

09:19.101 --> 09:22.120
Trees are sticky,
and they got bugs in them.

09:24.874 --> 09:27.609
This place is so random.

09:27.643 --> 09:30.111
I don't know. It's kind of,
like, in the middle of nowhere.

09:30.129 --> 09:32.297
I know. That's,
like, the hilarious part.

09:32.331 --> 09:34.747
It's like a joke
how long it takes to get here.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.121
It's like a meta-cabin.

09:36.241 --> 09:38.425
- Oh yeah.
- That's what I thought, yeah.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.802
I heard that Dave Eggers
wrote a short story

09:40.922 --> 09:42.524
about this tape cassette
that he found

09:42.558 --> 09:43.591
under that tree over there.

09:43.609 --> 09:45.527
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing?

09:45.561 --> 09:46.894
I'm trying to get
these annoying dumdums

09:46.912 --> 09:48.280
to pay more money
for your cabin.

09:48.331 --> 09:50.015
Carry on.

09:50.049 --> 09:51.716
Oh, my God, I heard that

09:51.767 --> 09:53.801
Neko Case and Ben Gibbard
made out here once.

09:53.819 --> 09:56.288
What?

09:56.339 --> 09:58.757
Saturday at the firm with Ben.

09:58.808 --> 10:00.892
Okay, we dissolve
the loan-out

10:00.926 --> 10:02.243
and file bankruptcy.

10:02.278 --> 10:04.613
That way only our clients
have claim to the assets.

10:04.647 --> 10:07.048
Great idea...

10:07.066 --> 10:09.034
that we had a month ago.

10:09.068 --> 10:11.336
The problem is,
the trust still has claim

10:11.370 --> 10:13.388
to the property.

10:13.422 --> 10:16.358
Then we dissolve the trust.

10:16.392 --> 10:19.961
Clients "A," "B," and "F,"
they would have to agree,

10:19.995 --> 10:22.047
but if they went for it,
we could arbitrate.

10:22.098 --> 10:23.481
He's right.

10:23.516 --> 10:26.368
We never thought of that.

10:26.402 --> 10:28.503
Oh, oh!
Ben, Ben.

10:28.537 --> 10:31.839
Say it again but this time
I'm gonna turn the light on,

10:31.857 --> 10:33.274
like you just had an idea.

10:33.308 --> 10:34.642
Sure, sure.
Yeah, I'm with you.

10:34.660 --> 10:37.262
Um, okay.

10:37.296 --> 10:40.448
What if we dissolve the trust?

10:40.483 --> 10:42.901
Yes!
You just cracked the case.

10:42.952 --> 10:44.169
I'm just doing my job.

10:45.838 --> 10:47.138
Okay, here's an idea.

10:47.173 --> 10:48.956
Maybe we name part of the park

10:48.974 --> 10:50.909
- the "Jamm Zone"?
- Hmm.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.410
Yeah, Jamm could dig on that.

10:52.445 --> 10:54.162
How about if in the Jamm zone,

10:54.196 --> 10:55.547
there's no married chicks
allowed?

10:55.598 --> 10:56.964
Caution, Jeremy.

10:56.982 --> 10:58.183
I think there are people
that will find

10:58.234 --> 10:59.834
the "No Married Chicks" zone

10:59.869 --> 11:01.569
both morally repugnant
and hard to enforce.

11:01.587 --> 11:02.587
All right.

11:02.621 --> 11:05.056
Listen, let us celebrate
this progress

11:05.091 --> 11:09.627
by sharing
these authentic edamame,

11:09.662 --> 11:11.779
or Tokyo beans.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.114
Now I want you
to be very careful

11:13.149 --> 11:14.349
about eating these.

11:14.383 --> 11:16.735
You eat the shells,
and you throw the seeds out.

11:16.769 --> 11:18.987
Wow. You have really immersed
yourself in Asian culture.

11:19.021 --> 11:20.805
Now I think maybe
we should revisit

11:20.840 --> 11:22.090
the holding bond idea.

11:22.108 --> 11:23.669
Ugh, Lezzie.
Come on, I'm getting bored.

11:23.693 --> 11:25.243
I mean, we've been
at this for hours.

11:25.294 --> 11:26.711
Can we please take a break?

11:26.746 --> 11:27.746
Perhaps he has a point.

11:27.763 --> 11:29.347
And we've made some progress.

11:29.382 --> 11:31.332
Maybe we go home and take
the rest of it up on Monday.

11:31.350 --> 11:32.317
No, I cannot wait until Monday.

11:32.368 --> 11:33.401
I need to close this deal now.

11:33.435 --> 11:34.486
So I have an idea.

11:34.537 --> 11:36.270
Let's have a change of venue

11:36.288 --> 11:38.406
and keep negotiating
while we have fun.

11:38.424 --> 11:40.191
If I remember correctly,
you enjoy

11:40.226 --> 11:44.028
the ancient art of karaoke,
yes?

11:44.063 --> 11:46.781
I do.
And kudos on that pronunciation.

11:46.799 --> 11:49.050
I remembered
your favorite duet.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.686
Maybe it's time to take
this party to Rydell High.

11:51.721 --> 11:53.071
Whoa!

11:53.105 --> 11:54.856
I cannot wait to hear
your Travolta.

11:54.890 --> 11:56.875
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm Sandra Dee.

11:56.926 --> 11:58.626
That's more of my register.

11:58.644 --> 12:01.146
You're Zuko.

12:01.197 --> 12:05.083
â™ª He got friendly,
holdin' my hand â™ª

12:05.134 --> 12:08.787
â™ª She got friendly
down in the sand â™ª

12:08.821 --> 12:12.306
â™ª He was sweet,
just turned 18 â™ª

12:12.324 --> 12:15.543
â™ª Well, she was good,
you know what I mean? â™ª

12:15.577 --> 12:16.744
â™ª Uh

12:16.762 --> 12:19.514
â™ª summer heat
boy and girl meet â™ª

12:19.548 --> 12:23.034
â™ª but ah, oh,
those summer nights â™ª

12:23.068 --> 12:25.086
I would like to buy five DVDs
of this.

12:25.121 --> 12:26.337
No, 20.

12:26.372 --> 12:27.772
No, 60!
No, that's insane.

12:27.807 --> 12:29.140
20.

12:29.191 --> 12:30.241
â™ª Dubee doo dubee doo

12:30.276 --> 12:32.860
â™ª dubee dubee dubee dow â™ª

12:32.878 --> 12:34.512
Good news.

12:34.547 --> 12:36.181
We have multiple bidders.

12:36.215 --> 12:37.916
That guy's getting
his financials together.

12:37.950 --> 12:39.067
Plans on tearing
the whole place down,

12:39.101 --> 12:40.652
just wants it for the land.

12:40.703 --> 12:43.104
Why would he want to tear down
a perfectly good cabin?

12:43.122 --> 12:44.122
I think he's a developer,

12:44.123 --> 12:46.707
wants to put in
a luxury glamp-ground.

12:46.725 --> 12:48.443
Glamping is "glamour camping."

12:48.477 --> 12:50.695
Heated tents,
catered meals, wi-fi--

12:50.729 --> 12:51.963
You're describing a hotel.

12:51.997 --> 12:53.915
And I think we still have
traction with those two.

12:53.949 --> 12:55.583
Oh, hey, man.
I love the mustache.

12:55.601 --> 12:56.885
So funny.

12:56.919 --> 12:58.386
You ever think about twisting
it up at the ends, huh?

12:58.404 --> 12:59.404
Use a little beeswax?

12:59.438 --> 13:01.656
The open house is now closed.

13:01.690 --> 13:03.725
We are not accepting bids
at this time.

13:03.759 --> 13:05.927
The sun sets in 95 minutes.

13:05.961 --> 13:08.980
Good day.

13:10.432 --> 13:12.450
That's part of the charm
of this whole place--

13:12.501 --> 13:14.369
the cantankerous old coot
who owns it.

13:14.403 --> 13:15.870
It's authentic!

13:15.888 --> 13:18.223
I gotta say,
that was pretty fun up there.

13:18.274 --> 13:20.825
We have fun
when we collaborate, right?

13:20.860 --> 13:23.745
Working together?
Lockbox, right?

13:23.779 --> 13:26.747
You know, in some weird,
perverted, sexual way,

13:26.765 --> 13:27.782
I'm gonna miss you
when you're gone.

13:27.817 --> 13:29.818
- Oh.
- You are my Nemesis.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.369
You're the Superman
to my Lex Luthor.

13:31.420 --> 13:33.338
You want to be Lex Luthor?

13:33.372 --> 13:36.007
Uh, yeah.
Lex Luthor is rich.

13:36.058 --> 13:38.309
Well, okay.
I can't argue with that.

13:38.344 --> 13:40.812
So I did Zuko for you.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.463
Now you give me the lockbox.

13:42.498 --> 13:44.899
Leslie put a beautiful cross
into the box, Jeremy.

13:44.917 --> 13:46.217
Time for you to head it in.

13:46.252 --> 13:47.669
All right, Knope.
What can I say?

13:47.703 --> 13:49.137
You wore me down.

13:49.171 --> 13:52.190
I will give you my word,
and I will put it in writing,

13:52.224 --> 13:53.942
so I can't back out.

13:53.976 --> 13:56.644
We won't touch the money
for one year.

13:56.662 --> 13:59.697
And if the economy holds up,
you can start construction then.

14:01.784 --> 14:03.868
Leslie, you have your lockbox.

14:03.919 --> 14:05.653
And you scored
a triple dragon on your song.

14:05.671 --> 14:07.872
No, I cannot wait a year.

14:07.923 --> 14:09.123
I want to get started now.

14:09.157 --> 14:10.375
I want construction started
on Monday.

14:10.426 --> 14:11.543
You have his word.

14:11.594 --> 14:13.628
And this is riddled
with spelling errors,

14:13.662 --> 14:15.630
- but it is binding.
- It's not good enough!

14:15.664 --> 14:18.433
Jamm, I sang your stupid song,

14:18.467 --> 14:20.852
I ate your stupid
fake Asian food,

14:20.886 --> 14:22.169
and by the way,
you should know,

14:22.187 --> 14:23.504
you don't make sushi rolls
out of tuna salad--

14:23.522 --> 14:24.806
Maybe you don't.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.558
I did practically
everything you wanted,

14:26.609 --> 14:28.210
and you won't just give this
to me today?

14:28.227 --> 14:29.777
Screw you!

14:31.179 --> 14:33.299
- You're giving a card to me?
- You left me no choice.

14:33.315 --> 14:35.650
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Please, could you excuse us?

14:36.953 --> 14:38.823
Leslie, you should be happy!

14:39.063 --> 14:41.030
You beat Jamm
in the final battle.

14:41.765 --> 14:44.817
Unless there's something more
going on here.

14:44.835 --> 14:46.118
Ann.
This is about Ann.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.754
Ann Perkins?
I love Ann Perkins.

14:47.788 --> 14:51.157
Pawnee Commons is why
I met Ann five years ago.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.709
And I know you guys are
talking about moving.

14:52.743 --> 14:55.428
But I guess I thought
if maybe Ann came back

14:55.462 --> 14:57.030
from Michigan tomorrow,
and I was able to look

14:57.064 --> 15:00.066
into her smoky,
ethnically ambiguous eyes

15:00.084 --> 15:01.835
and tell her that we were
breaking ground

15:01.869 --> 15:04.470
on a new park,
she might--

15:04.488 --> 15:07.273
- she might want to stay.
- Leslie, I'm sorry.

15:07.291 --> 15:10.059
Ann didn't just go
to Ann arbor to visit family.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.945
She went to sign the lease
on our new home.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.230
Ann arbor sounds disgusting.

15:14.265 --> 15:16.115
She already has family there.

15:16.150 --> 15:18.510
And I have a new job lined up
at the University of Michigan.

15:18.519 --> 15:20.904
Go blue!

15:20.955 --> 15:22.121
It's a good town.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.623
And it's a great place
to raise a family.

15:23.657 --> 15:25.958
What is great about it?
There's no JJ's Diner there.

15:25.976 --> 15:28.060
There's no
"Welcome to Pawnee" sign.

15:28.078 --> 15:29.629
I mean, the stupid state

15:29.663 --> 15:31.047
is split up into two pieces!

15:31.081 --> 15:32.048
It's ridiculous.

15:32.082 --> 15:33.666
Unexpected play here, Superman.

15:33.684 --> 15:35.385
Not exactly sure
what you're going for,

15:35.419 --> 15:36.435
but I dig your Gambit.

15:36.453 --> 15:38.504
There is no Gambit here, Jamm.

15:38.539 --> 15:41.841
And who sides
with Lex Luthor, by the way?

15:41.859 --> 15:43.776
You probably watch
<i>Million Dollar Baby</i>

15:43.794 --> 15:44.777
and root for the stool.

15:44.795 --> 15:45.762
I haven't seen it.

15:45.796 --> 15:47.680
Not a big Morgan Freeman guy.

15:47.715 --> 15:50.099
I find his voice very grating.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.001
I am leaving now.
I am not moving.

15:52.036 --> 15:53.202
I'm just going home.

15:53.237 --> 15:54.470
Are you guys coming back
to my place?

15:54.505 --> 15:56.573
What's--what's--
or are you guys going back to--

15:56.607 --> 15:59.125
we wrapping up the weekend?

16:00.661 --> 16:01.895
No?

16:01.929 --> 16:05.064
â™ª Need a cup to perk me up

16:05.098 --> 16:07.200
â™ª coffee in the morning

16:07.234 --> 16:09.335
- Surprise!
- Oh, my God!

16:11.388 --> 16:12.405
I hope you don't mind.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.140
We decided to throw you
a pizza party

16:14.158 --> 16:16.509
to say congrats
for cracking the case.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.878
Oh, my God, you guys.

16:18.896 --> 16:20.063
See what we got here.

16:20.114 --> 16:22.065
Wait a second.
That's not pizza.

16:22.099 --> 16:23.249
Those are calzones!

16:24.301 --> 16:26.853
- I love calzones!
- We know!

16:26.887 --> 16:30.707
I think it's safe to say
I made the right choice.

16:30.741 --> 16:31.857
What's up, guys?

16:31.875 --> 16:35.428

16:44.271 --> 16:47.757
BFF slideshow?

16:47.791 --> 16:49.425
You know that
even after we leave Pawnee,

16:49.476 --> 16:50.927
Ann will always be
your best friend.

16:51.979 --> 16:53.579
And it's not that long a trip.

16:53.614 --> 16:54.774
Well, it would be even faster

16:54.782 --> 16:56.332
if the governor would return
my calls

16:56.367 --> 16:59.251
about my Pawnee-to-Ann arbor
bullet train idea.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.029
You know, I went
to Jamm's with you because

17:01.054 --> 17:04.457
I also want to leave
the right kind of legacy,

17:04.491 --> 17:06.592
and that includes
Pawnee commons.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.094
Well, I think
I burned that bridge with Jamm.

17:08.112 --> 17:09.529
We're not gonna get
that lockbox.

17:09.563 --> 17:12.080
And I am not singing
<i>Beauty School Dropout.</i>

17:12.132 --> 17:14.733
It's sexist,
and I don't do slow jams.

17:14.768 --> 17:16.185
I have an idea.

17:16.236 --> 17:19.271
And I'd like you to consider it

17:19.289 --> 17:21.424
a good-bye gift
from me to you.

17:23.227 --> 17:26.496
No, thank you.
I will let him know.

17:26.530 --> 17:28.164
That was that couple you liked
at the open house.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.465
I despised them.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.684
Well, they just came back
with a new offer

17:31.719 --> 17:34.237
and jacked that shizz up.

17:34.288 --> 17:35.955
Way over asking price.

17:35.990 --> 17:38.408
Ron, who cares who they are?
That's a massive bid.

17:38.442 --> 17:39.809
I'ma be a mogul.

17:39.843 --> 17:42.628
I bought that cabin
18 years ago for $2,200.

17:42.646 --> 17:44.113
I do not care about the money.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.082
I can't even understand
what you're saying right now.

17:46.116 --> 17:48.468
That cabin served
an important purpose for me,

17:48.502 --> 17:51.654
as a quiet refuge from
the nonsense of modern life.

17:51.689 --> 17:53.305
I'd like the next owners
to understand

17:53.323 --> 17:54.940
and share that purpose.

17:54.958 --> 17:58.127
Find me someone like that,
and I'll happily sell.

17:58.162 --> 17:59.429
I'll buy it.

17:59.480 --> 18:01.680
You can't afford that house.

18:01.699 --> 18:02.899
Can you afford that house?

18:02.950 --> 18:04.534
What would you use it for?

18:04.585 --> 18:08.121
I'd go up there
and take Andy and Champion

18:08.155 --> 18:09.872
and just get away
from everyone else

18:09.907 --> 18:10.940
and look at spiders.

18:10.974 --> 18:12.658
And it's where I'd bury
the bodies

18:12.693 --> 18:14.444
of that annoying couple
after I murder them.

18:14.495 --> 18:15.861
Here's my offer.

18:15.879 --> 18:19.599
I will give you everything
in my purse.

18:19.633 --> 18:23.436
$8, a bunch
of loose cough drops,

18:23.454 --> 18:25.922
and Larry's asthma inhaler.

18:25.956 --> 18:27.590
Thank God.
I've been looking for that.

18:27.641 --> 18:29.675
Larry, this is part of
a real estate transaction now.

18:29.693 --> 18:31.144
You have no legal claim to it.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.813
Sorry, I had no idea.

18:33.831 --> 18:36.265
This is the best offer
I've heard yet.

18:36.300 --> 18:38.267
Uh, you tripping right now.

18:38.302 --> 18:39.385
Sold.

18:39.403 --> 18:40.703
Don't even trip.

18:40.738 --> 18:42.021
Your commission.

18:42.039 --> 18:45.925
Thanks a lot.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.960
Your share, mogul.

18:47.994 --> 18:49.512
I'm about to play golf
with a guy

18:49.563 --> 18:51.314
who was almost
on <i>The Apprentice,</i>

18:51.348 --> 18:52.548
so this better be good.

18:52.583 --> 18:54.901
You give Leslie her lockbox,

18:54.935 --> 18:57.536
and you get me
in your hip pocket.

18:57.554 --> 18:59.088
Starting in my next term
as city manager,

18:59.123 --> 19:03.559
I will give you
one huge I.O.U.,

19:03.610 --> 19:05.545
no questions asked.

19:05.579 --> 19:06.546
Hmm.

19:06.580 --> 19:09.966
Jamm likes the sound of that.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.102
Let's make it five I.O.U.s,
and you got a deal.

19:13.137 --> 19:17.190
You drive a hard bargain,
but you leave me no choice.

19:17.224 --> 19:20.076
Fine.
Five huge IOUs.

19:20.110 --> 19:21.227
Deal, guys.

19:21.245 --> 19:22.912
You must really want that park.

19:22.946 --> 19:24.030
I do. Yes.

19:24.064 --> 19:26.249
And to tell you the truth,

19:26.283 --> 19:28.284
I'm doing it all
for my best friend.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.436
That's all I wanted to hear.

19:30.734 --> 19:33.235
Leslie,
you're my best friend too.

19:35.984 --> 19:39.181
Well, vote passed. 3-2.

19:39.421 --> 19:41.705
Jamm is gonna be so pissed
when he finds out

19:41.723 --> 19:42.531
that you're leaving

19:42.651 --> 19:43.891
and your I.O.U.s are worthless.

19:43.906 --> 19:45.039
Are you sure you're okay
with what you did?

19:45.073 --> 19:47.041
Well, it's not
the most ethical thing

19:47.075 --> 19:48.343
that I've ever done,

19:48.377 --> 19:50.244
but on the flip side,
Jamm is a big, mean dope.

19:50.262 --> 19:51.579
- Mm-hmm.
- And I hope that this eases

19:51.614 --> 19:53.398
some of the pain of us
moving away a little bit.

19:53.432 --> 19:54.532
Oh, I'm currently
in deep denial

19:54.567 --> 19:55.850
that that's happening.

19:55.885 --> 19:58.136
Speaking of which,
how's the new gig coming?

19:58.187 --> 19:59.187
Well, I got a raise,

19:59.221 --> 20:00.855
and my fridge is full
of calzones,

20:00.890 --> 20:02.256
so not complaining.

20:02.274 --> 20:03.641
The reason I ask is
this town is gonna need

20:03.692 --> 20:05.092
a new city manager.

20:05.111 --> 20:06.478
And I've talked to some people,

20:06.529 --> 20:09.697
and you have the votes
if you want the job.

20:09.732 --> 20:11.816
Wh--

20:11.867 --> 20:12.901
Seriously?

20:12.935 --> 20:13.935
Is this for realskis?

20:13.953 --> 20:16.905
This is 100% certified
for realskis.

20:16.939 --> 20:19.457
- What do you say?
- I mean, I--wow.

20:19.492 --> 20:21.409
I would be insane to say no.

20:21.443 --> 20:22.944
Oh, no.

20:24.914 --> 20:26.548
Wyatt, you're late.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.919
I'm just kidding,
you can do whatever you want.

20:30.953 --> 20:33.087
Actually, Barney,

20:33.121 --> 20:36.124
I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

20:36.158 --> 20:38.042
Today's my last day.

20:38.077 --> 20:40.295
I got an opportunity
I couldn't say no to,

20:40.329 --> 20:42.464
and I have to quit.
Again.

20:42.498 --> 20:45.550
No need to explain.

20:45.584 --> 20:48.169
I knew it was too good
to be true.

20:48.203 --> 20:51.556
Oh, I do have
a little going-away gift.

20:51.590 --> 20:53.925
Left it in the break room.

20:53.976 --> 20:56.427
If anyone could appreciate it,
it's you guys.

20:56.479 --> 20:58.980
"You can play with one warrior,

20:59.014 --> 21:00.715
"but it's just
not nearly as good.

21:00.733 --> 21:03.268
Enjoy.
Ben Wyatt."

21:03.319 --> 21:04.269
Let's play.

21:04.320 --> 21:06.053
- I call ledgerman!
- No.
