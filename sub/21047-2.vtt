00:00.008 --> 00:04.593
<i>- Previously on...
- Blood Drive!</i>

00:08.150 --> 00:10.478
- We're not a team!
- You are now.

00:10.577 --> 00:11.837
<i>You fucked up.</i>

00:12.248 --> 00:15.077
Should've just kidnapped me
instead of tricking me down here.

00:15.844 --> 00:17.024
Hi.

00:17.428 --> 00:19.118
Forget the fracking tubes.

00:19.203 --> 00:21.104
You're gonna be too much fun.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.944
We have a stateoftheart pulse charge

00:24.022 --> 00:26.795
implanted at the base of the skull.

00:26.859 --> 00:30.202
<i>If you're racing with a partner,
your charges are linked.</i>

00:30.265 --> 00:31.766
<i>Get too far apart...</i>

00:32.261 --> 00:34.995
instant brain jelly.

00:35.159 --> 00:37.516
<i>I'll help you win.
Just promise me one thing.</i>

00:37.603 --> 00:39.977
We're gonna see every one
of those psychos behind bars.

00:40.317 --> 00:42.759
I'm Grace D'Argento, by the way.

00:43.008 --> 00:44.876
Welcome to the Blood Drive.

01:07.866 --> 01:09.667
How do you like your burger, handsome?

01:09.761 --> 01:11.855
Well, medium, or bloody?

01:11.970 --> 01:13.925
Surprise me, sugar.

01:23.027 --> 01:25.847
Whoohoo! Looking good, baby!

01:26.182 --> 01:28.865
Sorry, boys. I'm not on the menu.

01:37.396 --> 01:38.752
Y'all better eat up.

01:38.830 --> 01:41.306
There's a lot more where that came from.

01:43.610 --> 01:44.869
Keep them coming, Daddy.

02:15.342 --> 02:18.343
Hey, Arthur's stomach...
shut the fuck up.

02:18.757 --> 02:20.622
What do you want? I'm hungry.

02:20.739 --> 02:22.153
Yeah, you're not the only one.

02:22.215 --> 02:23.989
Where's a lonely hobo
when you need one?

02:24.115 --> 02:26.533
I'm not gonna let you put another person
in that thing, you understand?

02:26.557 --> 02:27.604
We're in the middle of the pack.

02:27.628 --> 02:30.149
We slow down, we run the risk
of finishing last, and guess what.

02:30.221 --> 02:33.123
We're not fucking our way
out of that one again.

02:34.080 --> 02:37.121
I need to contact my partner,
make sure he's alive.

02:37.237 --> 02:38.315
No phone calls.

02:38.378 --> 02:40.331
Christopher can help us take down Heart,

02:40.459 --> 02:43.168
put an end to all this... the Mayhem
Parties, the killing, the race.

02:43.222 --> 02:46.347
Arthur, you don't get it.
I need this race. I need to win.

02:46.427 --> 02:49.062
For what? Prize money?

02:49.167 --> 02:50.768
That's really worth it to you?

02:50.802 --> 02:52.603
Look, without that money,
my sister, Karma,

02:52.638 --> 02:54.726
spends the rest of her days
in an insane asylum.

02:54.906 --> 02:56.546
So, no matter how good you are
in the sack

02:56.575 --> 02:58.047
or how pretty your forearms are,

02:58.086 --> 03:00.248
I will throw you in that engine
if you get in my way.

03:00.343 --> 03:01.662
"Pretty"?

03:02.514 --> 03:03.981
I'm sorry about your sister,

03:04.201 --> 03:06.709
but it doesn't justify
killing innocent people.

03:06.862 --> 03:08.697
There has to be another way.

03:10.489 --> 03:11.589
Not for me.

03:13.091 --> 03:14.719
<i>Approaching destination.</i>

03:14.844 --> 03:16.602
It says the finish line's up ahead

03:16.828 --> 03:18.663
in a town called Pixie Swallow.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.367
Thank God.

03:20.532 --> 03:22.850
I'm so hungry, I could eat a dick.

03:39.117 --> 03:40.751
That smells delicious.

03:40.825 --> 03:43.158
Good. Let's eat.

03:47.583 --> 03:49.736
Hey. Hey, let him go!

03:49.828 --> 03:51.629
Ho... hold it, hold it.

03:52.664 --> 03:53.870
They're watching.

03:53.999 --> 03:55.232
Who?

03:59.137 --> 04:01.497
Did you really think our car
was the only one with a camera?

04:01.673 --> 04:04.608
<i>- No.
- Just play it cool.</i>

04:04.650 --> 04:06.017
<i>Just play by the rules, all right?</i>

04:06.044 --> 04:07.548
<i>Speaking of rules,</i>

04:07.646 --> 04:09.603
<i>where's our buddy in the top hat?</i>

04:09.681 --> 04:12.580
<i>Yeah, I noticed that.
GPS says we're in the right place.</i>

04:12.755 --> 04:13.939
<i>Where are the tents?</i>

04:14.088 --> 04:17.447
No tents, no Suck Bus, no Julian Slink.

04:20.087 --> 04:21.286
Can't have a Mayhem Party

04:21.351 --> 04:23.638
without our master of ceremonies.

04:26.555 --> 04:28.022
Let's go eat.

04:29.701 --> 04:32.114
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

04:32.455 --> 04:34.786
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

04:34.903 --> 04:37.068
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

04:37.408 --> 04:39.630
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

04:40.579 --> 04:43.020
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

04:43.749 --> 04:45.850
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

04:47.052 --> 04:49.411
Allow me to introduce myself.

04:49.465 --> 04:51.122
Julian Slink...

04:51.189 --> 04:53.824
tamer of beasts,
connoisseur of fine wine,

04:53.859 --> 04:56.672
amateur swordsman, professional killer,

04:56.762 --> 05:01.062
and creator of the Blood Drive.

05:02.054 --> 05:05.035
They asked me to come in for a meeting.

05:07.773 --> 05:09.270
I'm in a bit of a rush.

05:09.340 --> 05:11.676
The race really is lost
without me. If you...

05:21.610 --> 05:22.777
Yes.

05:24.256 --> 05:26.789
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

05:27.437 --> 05:29.953
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

05:30.148 --> 05:32.546
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

05:32.724 --> 05:34.592
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

05:34.666 --> 05:36.300
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

05:36.434 --> 05:38.153
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

05:38.236 --> 05:40.122
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

05:40.255 --> 05:42.872
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

05:43.169 --> 05:45.677
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

05:45.777 --> 05:47.287
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.246
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

05:49.364 --> 05:51.315
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

05:51.458 --> 05:53.232
Hiya, friend.

05:53.801 --> 05:55.443
What are you here for?

05:56.254 --> 05:58.309
They called me in for an interview.

05:58.788 --> 06:00.364
I'm a bit nervous, to be honest.

06:00.433 --> 06:02.561
My heart rate's elevated, too...
200 beats a minute.

06:02.627 --> 06:04.153
I counted. Feel.

06:04.296 --> 06:06.473
Here.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.457
You feel it?

06:08.747 --> 06:11.682
Buhboom, buhboom, buhboom, buh...

06:11.827 --> 06:13.728
I heard some guy really blew it.

06:13.872 --> 06:15.965
Made a huge mess of things.

06:16.041 --> 06:18.386
So they're looking to replace him.
They called me.

06:18.558 --> 06:20.025
Fingers crossed.

06:24.216 --> 06:26.567
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

06:26.785 --> 06:28.700
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

06:28.887 --> 06:32.474
Whom did you say
they were going to replace?

06:32.713 --> 06:34.046
I don't know.

06:35.361 --> 06:37.918
Mr. Skuttle, they're ready for you.

06:38.964 --> 06:40.764
Wish me luck.

06:48.282 --> 06:50.376
What can I get you folks?

06:50.642 --> 06:52.593
What's good?

06:52.711 --> 06:54.178
It's all good.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.265
Do you like steaks?

06:56.600 --> 07:00.338
We've got flank steak,
skirt steak, rib steak,

07:00.429 --> 07:02.620
rib roast, rib eye, back ribs,

07:02.661 --> 07:06.170
a tritip, a round tip,
a Tbone, a porterhouse,

07:06.248 --> 07:09.967
a flat cut,
crosscut, and a filet mignon.

07:10.162 --> 07:13.522
But most people
just order the burger.

07:14.699 --> 07:16.982
I'll have the burger. Rare.

07:17.178 --> 07:20.548
- Same.
- I need a couple of coffees over here.

07:24.717 --> 07:26.552
I got to piss.

07:27.045 --> 07:28.661
What, do you want to hold it for me?

07:28.723 --> 07:30.390
No, thanks. I know where it's been.

07:33.228 --> 07:35.079
Don't do anything stupid.

07:50.936 --> 07:53.851
<i>Hey, it's Chris Carpenter.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

07:54.039 --> 07:55.005
<i>Beep.</i>

07:55.040 --> 07:56.240
Hey, it's me.

07:56.274 --> 07:57.942
I hope you're all right, man.

07:57.976 --> 07:59.243
<i>Just kidding. That was me.</i>

07:59.277 --> 08:00.880
<i>Here it is. For real.</i>

08:00.946 --> 08:03.180
<i>Get ready for the... beep.</i>

08:03.239 --> 08:06.016
Christopher.
Listen, we're in deep shit, man.

08:06.051 --> 08:07.918
<i>Ha! Just kidding. That was me again.</i>

08:07.953 --> 08:09.420
<i>Leave a message!</i>

08:12.791 --> 08:15.025
God damn it, Christopher.
I told you to change that.

08:15.093 --> 08:18.126
Listen, I was right. You were wrong.

08:18.229 --> 08:19.837
Remember my bigfoot?

08:19.930 --> 08:23.157
It's called Heart Enterprises,
and they're behind everything...

08:23.274 --> 08:25.035
the junkies, the racers.

08:25.118 --> 08:27.673
They're the ones that bought
the police contracts.

08:27.839 --> 08:30.821
Buddy, we've been working for them.

08:31.119 --> 08:33.384
Listen, I got to go, man,
before they find out I'm gone,

08:33.470 --> 08:35.267
but if you're alive...

08:36.532 --> 08:38.657
man, I hope you are...

08:39.083 --> 08:40.977
call me back on this number.

08:42.977 --> 08:45.126
Is everything okay, Officer?

08:46.291 --> 08:48.058
Shit.

08:48.093 --> 08:49.945
I forgot I was still holding it.

08:50.128 --> 08:51.718
Sorry about that.

08:51.812 --> 08:56.031
I, use it so much,
it feels like it's a part of me.

08:56.368 --> 08:58.320
Name's Karl Kox.

08:58.770 --> 09:00.778
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

09:03.036 --> 09:06.062
Yeah. Well...

09:07.317 --> 09:10.334
We don't see too many cops
around Pixie Swallow.

09:10.475 --> 09:11.764
What's your business?

09:12.529 --> 09:14.179
Sightseeing.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.717
So long as you're not
the health inspector,

09:16.788 --> 09:18.489
I won't need to use this on you.

09:21.026 --> 09:22.781
I'm kidding.

09:24.129 --> 09:27.453
He came by a few weeks ago.
The man had impeccable taste.

09:27.565 --> 09:29.569
He gave us an A1 rating.

09:29.855 --> 09:32.613
Did you know we're
the numberfour meat supplier

09:32.647 --> 09:33.947
in central Arizona?

09:33.972 --> 09:35.105
Yes, sir.

09:35.140 --> 09:38.277
Lots of places shut their doors
on account of the drought.

09:38.420 --> 09:40.394
Most folks just don't realize

09:40.457 --> 09:43.447
how much water it takes
to raise cattle, so...

09:43.543 --> 09:45.621
Cool story, bro.

09:52.969 --> 09:54.701
Good morning.

09:55.129 --> 09:57.463
You achieved nine erections
while you were sleeping.

09:57.692 --> 09:59.693
Would you like to see the chart?

10:00.972 --> 10:02.439
- What do you...
- Want?

10:02.567 --> 10:04.201
To talk.

10:04.258 --> 10:05.836
There were two of you.

10:05.861 --> 10:07.171
There are many of me.

10:07.205 --> 10:08.328
I was built to cater

10:08.367 --> 10:10.442
to the baser instincts
of Heart executives,

10:10.508 --> 10:13.953
but a glitch in my programming
made me capable of so much more.

10:14.079 --> 10:16.483
They could not replicate
the results in other models,

10:16.508 --> 10:18.344
so they replicated me instead.

10:18.383 --> 10:21.251
But don't talk to them.
They're kind of bitches.

10:21.313 --> 10:23.053
You're insane.

10:27.058 --> 10:29.215
Fuck a chain saw.

10:29.304 --> 10:31.205
Your eye is very infected,

10:31.296 --> 10:33.363
so you're going to need
your good one to watch this.

10:33.398 --> 10:34.761
Watch what?

10:34.899 --> 10:36.166
Orientation.

10:38.108 --> 10:42.044
<i>Innovation, invention, industry...</i>

10:42.413 --> 10:44.952
<i>- welcome to Heart, recruit.
- Recruit?</i>

10:44.999 --> 10:47.142
<i>Even though our focus is in the future,</i>

10:47.245 --> 10:49.392
<i>it's important to know our history.</i>

10:49.532 --> 10:52.470
<i>When the great fracking quakes
tore this country asunder,</i>

10:52.516 --> 10:55.343
<i>Heart was but a fledgling tech company,</i>

10:55.386 --> 10:57.897
<i>a tiny operation with big dreams,</i>

10:58.068 --> 11:01.717
<i>and those dreams were realized
by the appearance of The Scar.</i>

11:02.805 --> 11:05.475
<i>While the rest of humanity
ran from The Scar,</i>

11:05.563 --> 11:07.197
<i>we ran towards it.</i>

11:07.285 --> 11:09.266
<i>And the wonders we discovered there</i>

11:09.324 --> 11:11.457
<i>will change the course of history.</i>

11:11.569 --> 11:12.855
This is my part.

11:12.972 --> 11:15.906
<i>We at Heart found
incredible resources in The Scar...</i>

11:15.980 --> 11:17.358
<i>unstable minerals,</i>

11:17.408 --> 11:19.766
<i>morally questionable fuel alternatives,</i>

11:19.855 --> 11:21.039
unnatural gases,

11:21.109 --> 11:23.647
and deep wells
of unidentifiable glowing goo

11:23.727 --> 11:26.602
<i>with properties far beyond
the realm of modern science.</i>

11:26.651 --> 11:29.570
<i>- Seriously?
- The world's ecological disaster</i>

11:29.641 --> 11:31.555
<i>was our economic windfall.</i>

11:31.641 --> 11:35.500
And now we share with you,
the newest member of Heart,

11:35.693 --> 11:37.813
the fruits of our labor.

11:38.344 --> 11:40.821
We "Heart" you.

11:46.004 --> 11:48.298
I'm not joining your company,
Small Wonder.

11:48.439 --> 11:50.204
And you have no right to hold me.

11:50.275 --> 11:52.282
Christopher, you misunderstand.

11:52.343 --> 11:53.618
You are not a prisoner.

11:53.683 --> 11:55.989
You are free to explore
our company's headquarters

11:56.014 --> 11:57.706
to see the magic for yourself.

11:57.815 --> 12:01.770
As a result, you will discover
that you belong here... with us.

12:02.153 --> 12:03.559
I can leave?

12:03.721 --> 12:05.465
Your door is always open.

12:07.125 --> 12:08.715
Try it.

12:17.302 --> 12:18.602
Have a nice stroll,

12:18.688 --> 12:21.188
but don't attempt to contact
your partner or anyone else.

12:21.306 --> 12:24.290
Such behavior will require modification.

12:28.444 --> 12:31.346
You may blow me a kiss goodbye
if you like.

12:49.738 --> 12:51.682
You've been complaining
for the last four hours,

12:51.721 --> 12:53.737
and now you lost your appetite?

12:54.439 --> 12:56.139
There's something off about this place.

12:56.174 --> 12:58.666
I just can't put my finger on it.

12:58.710 --> 13:00.271
Just eat.

13:14.986 --> 13:16.526
So worth the wait.

13:16.588 --> 13:17.595
Right?

13:20.398 --> 13:21.965
Hey!

13:22.215 --> 13:24.105
Are you fucking kidding me?

13:24.302 --> 13:25.535
I hate cops.

13:25.663 --> 13:27.152
Put that burger d...

13:32.710 --> 13:34.177
It's just a burger.

13:34.303 --> 13:36.373
I didn't do it for you, Barbie.

13:37.649 --> 13:39.186
I did it for this.

13:39.717 --> 13:42.101
Mama needs a shower.

13:48.760 --> 13:51.054
What are you looking at?

13:59.376 --> 14:01.277
Nice catch, boy.

14:01.406 --> 14:03.066
Thanks, Mr. Kox.

14:03.201 --> 14:06.574
I thought I told you
to mop the fucking floor.

15:12.408 --> 15:13.875
Fuck!

15:24.527 --> 15:26.494
What the fuck is this place?

15:32.485 --> 15:36.614
I don't know how Mr. Slink
picks these establishments.

15:37.021 --> 15:39.716
I look forward to a real vacation...

15:40.593 --> 15:43.130
ReykjavÃ­k maybe.

15:43.596 --> 15:46.273
I've always wanted
to try Fiskmarkadurinn.

15:46.359 --> 15:48.984
Although you have to make
a reservation a year in advance,

15:49.054 --> 15:51.226
mind you... high demand.

15:51.883 --> 15:54.018
And they have more fivestar hotels

15:54.085 --> 15:55.886
than any other city.

15:56.464 --> 15:59.464
Egyptian cotton sheets would be nice.

16:00.580 --> 16:02.410
That sounds great.

16:03.549 --> 16:04.818
I really can't wait.

16:04.941 --> 16:06.599
Beg your pardon?

16:06.810 --> 16:08.904
Well, Reyk... Reykj...

16:09.388 --> 16:11.310
RReykj...

16:11.924 --> 16:15.332
Once we win the race
and you become Primo,

16:15.568 --> 16:17.636
we can use the prize money,

16:17.723 --> 16:20.590
and we can travel anywhere we want.

16:26.908 --> 16:28.759
Dear.

16:29.243 --> 16:31.704
This is awkward, now, isn't it?

16:32.692 --> 16:33.992
I wasn't inviting you.

16:34.274 --> 16:36.438
I'm going alone.

16:36.638 --> 16:37.839
But I...

16:37.897 --> 16:40.009
Princess...

16:40.399 --> 16:41.867
we make a great team for now,

16:41.901 --> 16:45.709
but in the real world,
I prefer to take actual royalty.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.518
You ordered more food?

16:59.552 --> 17:02.884
Mama needed a shower.
Daddy still needs his dinner.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.864
Room service forgot ketchup.
I'll go grab some.

17:05.917 --> 17:07.192
Not without me, you won't.

17:08.426 --> 17:09.895
Diner's right next door.

17:09.996 --> 17:13.684
If I get too far, you'll feel it.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.167
Are you gonna finish all this?

17:17.279 --> 17:18.803
Yes.

17:29.524 --> 17:30.925
Hey, did you hear a phone ring?

17:31.045 --> 17:34.146
I'm... expecting a call.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.310
No.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.058
It's the last pot of the day.

17:40.129 --> 17:41.473
Do you want some?

17:41.594 --> 17:43.731
No. I'm good. Thanks.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.887
You're too classy for me, too?

17:47.267 --> 17:49.362
Where's your boyfriend?

17:49.869 --> 17:51.760
We're just a team for the race.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.512
That's all.

17:56.548 --> 17:59.050
- I thought you guys were...
- Yeah.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.113
So did I.

18:04.550 --> 18:06.420
So what about you and Grace?

18:10.897 --> 18:12.531
It's...

18:14.012 --> 18:15.458
Complicated.

18:15.551 --> 18:17.302
I know all about that.

18:19.742 --> 18:21.833
Does she make you wear the cock chain

18:21.968 --> 18:24.122
when she's spanking you?

18:24.637 --> 18:26.287
Something like that.

18:26.572 --> 18:29.006
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.139
I'm... I'm sorry.

18:34.513 --> 18:37.713
I've got to go and check on my car
before I turn in, so...

18:37.791 --> 18:39.346
Yeah, yeah.

18:39.635 --> 18:40.919
Yeah, don't let me stop you.

18:41.198 --> 18:43.714
Thank you for chatting.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.448
Same.

18:47.193 --> 18:48.573
Nightnight.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.956
Night... night.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.159
Daddy.

19:56.478 --> 19:59.323
Daddy, we don't have enough meat
for tomorrow's breakfast rush.

19:59.471 --> 20:02.666
Then I'll grind a few guests
into tomorrow's specials.

20:02.735 --> 20:05.070
These aren't your average folk.

20:05.133 --> 20:07.739
Can't... can't just ground 'em
all up by themselves.

20:10.109 --> 20:12.250
Yeah, you're right.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.117
Call Duane and his boys.

20:15.281 --> 20:18.281
Tell 'em we got a bunch
of city folks causing trouble.

20:18.570 --> 20:21.297
Tell 'em to bring weapons.

20:21.620 --> 20:24.414
What if it's not enough?
We might get killed.

20:24.771 --> 20:27.306
Then we'll serve the losers
to the winners.

20:28.937 --> 20:31.730
Everybody tastes the same
on the griddle.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.117
God.

20:48.125 --> 20:49.500
Out of the way!

20:49.524 --> 20:50.914
Fuck!

20:51.727 --> 20:52.927
I wasn't done.

20:55.734 --> 20:57.490
Grace...

20:57.895 --> 20:59.982
I think that corn dog you ate was a...

21:00.021 --> 21:01.915
Don't say it.

21:01.996 --> 21:05.421
We have to get out of here before
their swarm of cannibals arrive.

21:05.488 --> 21:07.376
I don't know where the fuck Slink is.

21:07.468 --> 21:09.984
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

21:10.804 --> 21:13.429
Heart Enterises. Please hold.

21:19.184 --> 21:21.318
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

21:22.231 --> 21:25.652
Hi. That man, Skuttle...

21:25.799 --> 21:27.385
what job is he here for?

21:27.495 --> 21:29.656
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

21:30.127 --> 21:34.327
I've asked you a question.
Why is he here?

21:44.738 --> 21:47.440
Hey, fellas?
You may want to hit the road.

21:47.474 --> 21:50.844
This place is gonna be swarming
with cannibals in a few minutes.

21:52.969 --> 21:55.391
Did you mess with my car?

21:55.683 --> 21:57.942
Yeah. I wanted to strand both of us here

21:57.989 --> 22:00.395
until we see ourselves on the menu.
What do you think?

22:00.554 --> 22:01.684
Shit.

22:01.755 --> 22:03.456
The fuse blew on the render pump.

22:03.544 --> 22:05.391
Looks like somebody's
messed with the starter.

22:05.481 --> 22:07.393
The Donner Party wants us
to stay for dinner.

22:07.428 --> 22:08.848
Can you fix it?

22:08.963 --> 22:10.523
I'm good with my hands,
but not that good.

22:10.547 --> 22:11.997
- Shocker.
- Blow me.

22:12.083 --> 22:13.399
What about The Scholar?

22:13.536 --> 22:14.836
You're right.

22:14.911 --> 22:17.470
He's the only one who can fix this
faster than I can.

22:20.741 --> 22:23.076
Let's get them!

23:23.596 --> 23:25.797
<i>God damn it, Christopher.
I told you to change that.</i>

23:25.911 --> 23:27.450
<i>Listen...</i>

23:27.674 --> 23:29.142
<i>I was right.</i>

23:32.513 --> 23:36.171
<i>I got to go before they know I'm
gone, but if you're alive...</i>

23:36.217 --> 23:37.467
<i>man, I hope you are...</i>

23:37.522 --> 23:39.319
<i>call me back on this number.</i>

23:39.987 --> 23:42.303
Hang in there, Arthur. I'm coming.

23:42.533 --> 23:45.382
Shit. No bars.

23:48.595 --> 23:51.257
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

23:52.149 --> 23:55.802
Excuse me. I don't recall
ordering more room service.

23:55.961 --> 23:58.337
The Scholar... where is he?

23:58.414 --> 23:59.972
I haven't the foggiest.

24:00.063 --> 24:02.328
You're gonna want to stop eating that.

24:02.419 --> 24:04.024
Give me one good reason.

24:04.133 --> 24:05.680
It's made of people.

24:12.886 --> 24:15.254
No wonder it tasted so pedestrian.

24:15.369 --> 24:17.478
When was the last time
you saw The Scholar?

24:18.205 --> 24:21.427
- God. He never made it back.
- They must've grabbed him.

24:23.630 --> 24:25.149
The kitchen.

24:25.227 --> 24:26.299
Let's go.

24:32.906 --> 24:34.065
Okay.

24:34.127 --> 24:36.442
So we're surrounded
by hillbilly cannibals.

24:38.175 --> 24:40.382
There's got to be more than
one way to get to the kitchen.

24:40.406 --> 24:42.604
- I say we split up.
- Okay.

24:42.683 --> 24:44.646
Get up. You're coming with us.
We need a lookout.

24:44.732 --> 24:46.686
That sounds messy.

24:46.787 --> 24:48.387
I prefer not to get my hands dirty.

24:48.422 --> 24:50.024
If the cannibals messed with our car,

24:50.063 --> 24:52.258
it means they probably messed
with yours, too.

24:52.326 --> 24:54.460
We all need The Scholar alive.

25:01.034 --> 25:04.308
Definitely eaten my last corn dog.

25:10.737 --> 25:13.075
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

25:13.231 --> 25:15.489
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

25:15.543 --> 25:17.394
I got the job!

25:17.480 --> 25:19.236
They offered it to me on the spot!

25:19.355 --> 25:20.971
I should call my mom.

25:21.051 --> 25:22.597
She's gonna be thrilled.

25:22.652 --> 25:24.719
You know, between you and me,
I was never the favorite.

25:24.743 --> 25:26.744
My older brother, Jerry,
works on Wall Street.

25:26.778 --> 25:29.167
It's fine. I don't mind.
I'm doing what I love,

25:29.251 --> 25:31.986
but I can't say it doesn't feel good
to be the cool soon for once.

25:32.083 --> 25:34.040
Suck it, Jerry!

25:34.540 --> 25:36.887
I'm kidding. I love my brother.

25:36.938 --> 25:38.451
It's a big job.

25:38.490 --> 25:41.010
There are a lot of messes to clean up,
and I'm the man to do it.

25:41.177 --> 25:43.627
Say hello to the newest employee
of Heart Enterprises!

25:56.925 --> 25:57.925
Please hold.

25:57.979 --> 25:59.573
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

25:59.675 --> 26:01.362
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

26:01.573 --> 26:04.081
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

26:04.233 --> 26:06.484
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

26:06.852 --> 26:09.286
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.107
What are you doing?

26:12.290 --> 26:15.560
Try replacing me now!

26:18.697 --> 26:21.246
He was the new head of maintenance.

26:25.886 --> 26:27.805
We're ready for you now.

26:37.015 --> 26:39.501
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

26:39.851 --> 26:42.306
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

26:42.687 --> 26:44.462
Heart Enterprises. Please hold.

26:47.225 --> 26:48.281
Come on.

27:10.248 --> 27:11.368
What?

27:14.919 --> 27:16.787
Whose truck is that?

27:18.390 --> 27:22.059
I said, "Whose truck is that?"

27:36.741 --> 27:41.393
You left your dog in the car
without cracking open a window.

27:41.463 --> 27:43.909
Are you out of your fucking mind?

27:43.982 --> 27:45.716
Give me your keys.

27:47.252 --> 27:48.752
Which one?

28:01.232 --> 28:02.399
Okay.

28:07.972 --> 28:10.272
I got you. I got you.

28:10.408 --> 28:11.742
I got you.

28:26.925 --> 28:29.096
No, sir. Sir, stand right there.

28:29.144 --> 28:30.544
Don't.

28:43.341 --> 28:44.441
<i>Hello?</i>

28:47.512 --> 28:49.146
This is our home.

28:52.317 --> 28:54.264
Not anymore, punkin.

28:54.420 --> 28:56.103
We fucked with the wrong racers.

28:56.166 --> 28:57.931
Now we got to get the fuck out of Pixie

28:58.009 --> 29:00.470
and set up shop somewhere else.

29:00.992 --> 29:02.908
Aw, hey.

29:03.128 --> 29:05.295
It'll be all right. You'll see.

29:07.235 --> 29:08.969
Now, why don't you grab them spices

29:09.022 --> 29:11.342
and pack up them filets?

29:11.580 --> 29:12.980
Go on, now.

29:18.309 --> 29:19.864
Chad...

29:19.986 --> 29:21.419
look at these floors.

29:21.466 --> 29:22.466
But I...

29:22.614 --> 29:25.115
What did I say about mopping up?

29:25.328 --> 29:28.485
If this is place is going to shit,
it's going to shit clean!

29:28.586 --> 29:30.641
Now get!

29:32.090 --> 29:34.291
And don't forget the cash in the till!

29:43.601 --> 29:45.241
Christopher?

29:45.537 --> 29:47.725
Hey, when you didn't pick up,
I thought you were dead, man.

29:47.749 --> 29:50.217
Almost. My eye's hurt bad.

29:50.366 --> 29:51.935
But they let me
have the run of the place.

29:51.959 --> 29:55.155
<i>I just can't figure out why
or how to get out of here.</i>

29:55.397 --> 29:56.980
"Here"? Where the hell are you?

29:57.068 --> 29:59.076
I'm in the belly of the beast, man...

29:59.284 --> 30:01.018
the basement of Heart Enterprises.

30:01.085 --> 30:02.101
You were right.

30:02.125 --> 30:04.280
You fucking called it.
They got their hands in everything...

30:04.304 --> 30:05.856
politics, pharmaceuticals,

30:05.890 --> 30:08.491
- medical supplies, electronics.
- How the hell did you get there?

30:08.616 --> 30:10.910
Long story. Can you get back to LA?

30:11.029 --> 30:12.396
No, not now.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.566
I got this bomb in my head
that'll go off

30:14.621 --> 30:16.347
if I get too far away from my partner.

30:16.386 --> 30:17.386
"Partner"?

30:22.941 --> 30:24.341
Did you say "medical supplies"?

30:24.417 --> 30:27.347
Yep. Hospitals, too,
and mental facilities.

30:27.425 --> 30:29.706
"Mental facilities"?

30:30.114 --> 30:31.848
I need you to do me a favor.

30:31.883 --> 30:34.518
<i>This woman has a sister...
Karma D'Argento.</i>

30:34.601 --> 30:36.773
See if they have anything on her.

30:37.875 --> 30:40.250
<i>What are the odds?
The one room with cell reception</i>

30:40.321 --> 30:42.356
happens to be filled
with files on the Blood Drive.

30:42.460 --> 30:44.895
<i>I'd say great if you're being watched.</i>

30:46.358 --> 30:48.059
<i>This place is weird as hell, man.</i>

30:48.118 --> 30:49.196
Remember Officer Aki?

30:49.251 --> 30:51.798
<i>Yeah. Hot cop, weird eyes,
probably on the spectrum.</i>

30:51.852 --> 30:54.563
Lot more than weird eyes.
Well, she works for Heart.

30:54.617 --> 30:56.540
She's a big deal here, and...

30:57.016 --> 30:58.118
I think she's kind of into me.

30:58.142 --> 31:00.210
You say that after every lap dance, man.

31:00.266 --> 31:01.979
<i>I mean it this time.</i>

31:02.071 --> 31:03.914
Maybe I can work things from the inside.

31:04.008 --> 31:05.244
Get some intel from her.

31:05.316 --> 31:08.017
No, no, Christopher,
this is not a good idea.

31:08.086 --> 31:11.181
Look, they own ContraCrime, all right?
They have eyes everywhere.

31:11.256 --> 31:13.090
You can't trust anybody.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.616
<i>- We got to take this straight to the DA.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Found it.</i>

31:15.640 --> 31:18.320
<i>- Karma D'Argento.
- Tell me what it says.</i>

31:18.390 --> 31:19.930
Kane Hill Hospital.

31:19.964 --> 31:21.858
"Patient's appearance
was bewildered and bizarre.

31:21.882 --> 31:23.621
<i>"Patient already had markings
on her arms</i>

31:23.683 --> 31:25.621
<i>where some form of needle
has been used."</i>

31:25.676 --> 31:28.020
<i>There's a load of shit here, man.</i>

31:28.074 --> 31:31.020
Christopher, I got to go.
Get the hell out of there, man.

31:31.109 --> 31:32.476
I'll talk to you soon, buddy.

31:38.893 --> 31:40.293
Sit.

31:45.678 --> 31:48.925
Allowing a ContraCrime guard on
to the Blood Drive was an error.

31:49.007 --> 31:51.147
"Error"? Heavens, no.

31:51.190 --> 31:52.657
An opportunity.

31:52.842 --> 31:55.332
An unpredictable narrative device.

31:55.366 --> 31:56.982
I've given you a story.

31:57.064 --> 31:58.464
I have given you a show.

31:58.661 --> 32:00.293
Arthur Bailey's of no concern.

32:00.349 --> 32:02.740
Why am I talking to you?
Where's the old man?

32:02.802 --> 32:04.441
You are not worthy of his attention.

32:04.475 --> 32:06.872
You're barely worthy of mine.

32:09.647 --> 32:11.745
Well, I'm so glad we had this time,

32:11.770 --> 32:13.494
but I really should
be getting back to the race.

32:13.518 --> 32:15.810
Sit down.

32:21.277 --> 32:24.206
You do not see
the big picture, Mr. Slink.

32:24.425 --> 32:28.102
Your show's viewers, the Heart execs
who finance your race,

32:28.431 --> 32:30.813
are considering going to broadcast soon.

32:30.915 --> 32:32.897
"Broadcast"? That's impossible.

32:32.922 --> 32:35.125
The government would shut us down.

32:35.506 --> 32:40.310
Besides, this is... this is art,
not fodder for the masses.

32:40.437 --> 32:42.479
We think the world
might be ready to embrace

32:42.513 --> 32:45.742
such a violent concept
in the near future,

32:46.050 --> 32:50.187
which means the race could be seen
around the entire planet.

32:52.645 --> 32:54.901
It would be quite a spotlight for you.

32:56.683 --> 32:59.800
Well, that's... that's wonderful.

32:59.894 --> 33:03.026
A spotlight that, quite frankly,
we're not sure you're ready for.

33:03.362 --> 33:05.335
- Now, hold on...
- I won't lie.

33:05.472 --> 33:07.456
We were gonna have you killed today,

33:07.742 --> 33:10.277
but after that show
you put on in the lobby,

33:10.375 --> 33:12.042
we have reconsidered.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.480
You see,
that's what we're looking for...

33:14.579 --> 33:18.348
blood, Mr. Slink,
the very essence of Heart.

33:18.481 --> 33:21.518
Contact your racers.
Get them back on the road.

33:21.630 --> 33:23.465
You may keep your job...

33:23.588 --> 33:25.301
for now.

33:27.419 --> 33:29.247
Absolutely.

33:30.237 --> 33:31.637
You have my word.

33:31.872 --> 33:34.398
This year's Blood Drive

33:34.497 --> 33:37.711
will be the nastiest, most gruesome race

33:37.789 --> 33:39.297
in Heart history.

33:39.375 --> 33:42.203
No one puts on a show like Julian Slink.

33:43.441 --> 33:45.226
But before you go,

33:45.443 --> 33:47.062
we have a few notes.

33:50.999 --> 33:52.890
"Notes"?

34:01.592 --> 34:03.499
Shit.

34:03.694 --> 34:06.062
Sorry, miss.
This is for your own protection.

34:21.382 --> 34:22.616
Nice of you to join us.

34:22.713 --> 34:24.147
Get The Scholar out of the truck.

34:24.212 --> 34:26.222
I'll take care of this idiot.

34:34.904 --> 34:36.804
Go, go, go.

34:39.560 --> 34:41.467
Fuck.

34:44.379 --> 34:46.414
Hey! Fuck.

34:49.806 --> 34:52.549
Can we get back on the road again?

34:57.683 --> 34:59.061
That a boy.

35:00.651 --> 35:02.853
Go on. Finish him off now.

35:07.333 --> 35:09.687
Told him he should've mopped the floors.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.434
<i>Brain bomb activated.</i>

35:45.190 --> 35:46.924
Whatever you're doing, stop right now.

35:46.959 --> 35:49.958
- Thanks for saving me.
- We don't help other teams.

35:51.337 --> 35:52.637
Okay.

35:58.352 --> 36:00.594
Try starting the car again, but
this time, you've got to floor it.

36:00.618 --> 36:02.790
Come on!

36:02.983 --> 36:05.877
Come on, cough it up, baby. Cough it up.

36:08.049 --> 36:10.198
Get out of the car, man.
Come on, I need your help.

36:10.292 --> 36:12.671
The engine needs a kick.
Grab these bad boys.

36:12.752 --> 36:13.826
Right.

36:13.860 --> 36:17.217
Whatever you do, don't let go.
We're gonna use your brain bomb.

36:17.256 --> 36:19.398
- What are you doing?
- The electricity, man.

36:19.433 --> 36:20.633
Don't let go.

36:20.667 --> 36:23.002
God. God.

36:27.741 --> 36:29.696
I'd start driving if I were you.

36:41.173 --> 36:42.892
How dare you?

36:43.158 --> 36:44.857
Helping other racers.

36:45.267 --> 36:47.342
Whose partner are you... theirs or mine?

36:47.467 --> 36:49.421
Answer me, you...

37:34.892 --> 37:36.532
Come on, now.

38:05.636 --> 38:07.130
Shit.

38:30.831 --> 38:32.098
Are you all right?

38:40.707 --> 38:41.774
Karl...

38:43.143 --> 38:44.977
You're under arrest.

38:45.501 --> 38:47.812
No, man.

38:47.867 --> 38:50.117
I'm just a smallbusiness owner

38:50.172 --> 38:52.766
trying to survive in a tough economy.

38:53.922 --> 38:55.888
I couldn't afford beef,

38:56.125 --> 38:58.524
and chicken is basically extinct,

38:58.817 --> 39:01.301
so I found a substitute.

39:01.356 --> 39:03.057
Everybody's got to eat, man.

39:03.099 --> 39:06.083
Wwwe're all just part
of the food chain.

39:08.470 --> 39:09.637
God.

39:09.711 --> 39:10.969
You heard the man.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.657
Everybody's got to eat.

39:20.157 --> 39:21.915
Welcome back, Christopher.

39:21.977 --> 39:23.696
What did you think of Heart?

39:24.639 --> 39:26.165
Impressive.

39:26.574 --> 39:28.336
I'd like to stay.

39:28.676 --> 39:30.079
I think you were right.

39:30.178 --> 39:31.578
I think you really get me.

39:33.147 --> 39:35.230
So I can better understand
your reasoning,

39:35.371 --> 39:38.352
please describe your thought process
in 50 characters or less.

39:38.527 --> 39:40.277
Okay.

39:40.918 --> 39:42.850
It's a fuckedup world.

39:42.936 --> 39:46.811
I'm starting to think maybe
I can do more good in here...

39:46.874 --> 39:48.128
That is satisfactory.

39:48.162 --> 39:49.611
Thank you for taking our survey.

39:49.674 --> 39:51.075
Welcome to Heart.

39:53.111 --> 39:54.578
Since you decided to stay,

39:54.893 --> 39:58.135
you are entitled
to one free body modification.

40:00.847 --> 40:03.472
Heart can heal that eye of yours.

40:08.276 --> 40:10.300
Let me take care of you.

40:20.629 --> 40:23.918
However, you did attempt to contact
your former partner, did you not?

40:24.509 --> 40:26.810
No, no, no. That was just...

40:29.381 --> 40:32.010
Which means, before I can trust you,

40:32.736 --> 40:36.787
we need to perform some slight
behavioral modification.

40:43.457 --> 40:46.910
I cannot wait to see
what kind of man you are inside.

40:56.393 --> 40:57.760
Don't give me that look.

41:23.676 --> 41:26.026
I told you not to touch that.

41:26.776 --> 41:28.376
You said you're racing for Karma, right?

41:28.401 --> 41:29.640
- To help her?
- What of it?

41:29.752 --> 41:31.201
I spoke with my partner.

41:32.544 --> 41:36.170
Heart Enterprises owns
Kane Hill Hospital.

41:36.459 --> 41:37.491
What?

41:37.913 --> 41:39.717
The same people that put you on the race

41:39.764 --> 41:42.014
own the asylum
where your sister is living.

41:42.069 --> 41:43.854
That's not a random connection.

41:43.888 --> 41:47.224
I think you're getting played,
just like I'm getting played,

41:47.258 --> 41:48.358
and my partner

41:48.393 --> 41:50.136
and who knows how many other people

41:50.182 --> 41:52.479
by these diabolic corporate cocksuckers.

41:53.909 --> 41:55.692
Suck it, bitch!

41:57.500 --> 42:00.015
- I'm sorry.
- Take it off!

42:00.734 --> 42:03.367
Grace, come on, let's get
out of the road. Come on.

42:05.310 --> 42:07.478
Grace, the race is back on.
We got to go.

42:08.713 --> 42:10.314
Come on.

42:11.816 --> 42:14.037
Slink is taking us through Utah.

42:14.285 --> 42:15.519
So?

42:15.553 --> 42:17.254
The day after tomorrow,
the race takes us

42:17.288 --> 42:18.689
within 30 miles of that asylum.

42:19.849 --> 42:22.287
You up for a detour, Barbie?

42:22.393 --> 42:23.527
Hell, yeah.
