WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.471
It's time to take a stand
with The Gifted.

00:03.504 --> 00:06.006
-People need something
to believe in.
-Ahh!

00:06.040 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.977
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.010 --> 00:11.579
9-1-1, The Resident,

00:11.612 --> 00:12.880
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.913 --> 00:15.749
-Hey, partner.
-Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.019
ECLIPSE:
That was the entire
national leadership

00:19.053 --> 00:20.654
of the Mutant Underground.

00:20.688 --> 00:21.922
THUNDERBIRD:
You're just gonna stand around

00:21.955 --> 00:23.724
while the Inner Circle
murders people?

00:23.757 --> 00:24.925
This is not our fight.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.026
(grunting)

00:30.398 --> 00:33.167
Running into a battle you know
you're gonna lose isn't noble--

00:33.201 --> 00:34.168
it's selfish.

00:34.202 --> 00:35.203
What are you saying?

00:35.236 --> 00:36.437
I'm saying goodbye.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.939
ERG:
This is your community now.

00:38.972 --> 00:40.908
Welcome home, Blink.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.876
REED:
Lauren's changing.
She's becoming more violent.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.348
Your sister is in danger. Let us
help you reach out to her.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.250
We're the only ones who
really understand each other.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.584
Think of what we could do.

00:50.618 --> 00:51.585
I can't resist.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.053
I think I can help you.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.688
(exhales)

00:54.722 --> 00:56.023
You said she was coming.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.391
I can't feel her anymore.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.394
Someone was in my room.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.130
No one here is gonna mess
with your stuff.

01:02.163 --> 01:05.233
-Maybe. Maybe not.
-POLARIS:
He suspects something.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.400
ECLIPSE:
Is there any way
that you can find out

01:06.434 --> 01:07.435
when he might be alone?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.605
Okay.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.207
"Kilroy's Liquor Store."

01:13.241 --> 01:14.242
Gotcha.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.810
Move real slow.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.746
(grunting)

01:24.118 --> 01:27.087
MAN (over radio):
Bottom line: if some mutie
is at my kid's school,

01:27.121 --> 01:29.490
that's like a loaded gun
in the classroom.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.159
It's just common sense.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.927
But until we stand up,
acknowledge

01:33.961 --> 01:36.397
that there is a mutant problem
in this country,

01:36.430 --> 01:37.898
nothing is gonna happen.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.168
All right, that's our time.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.269
Until tomorrow.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.937
Stay safe. Stay vigilant.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.939
-(beep)
-And we're out.

01:45.973 --> 01:47.241
ANNOUNCER:
You're listening to WROG...

01:47.275 --> 01:48.509
When are you gonna talk
to management

01:48.542 --> 01:49.677
about this damn leak?

01:49.710 --> 01:51.078
You're gonna get me
electrocuted.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.147
I'll leave another message.

01:53.181 --> 01:55.416
Also, your appointment is here.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.186
Oh, right. Uh...

01:58.219 --> 02:00.154
yeah, send her in.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.622
I don't understand.

02:01.655 --> 02:02.990
When you called,

02:03.023 --> 02:04.825
I thought this was
about some kind of job.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.328
What I'm offering
is much more than a job.

02:07.361 --> 02:10.130
Think of it as a partnership.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.332
A partnership?

02:11.365 --> 02:13.267
I don't even know who you are.

02:13.301 --> 02:15.436
Oh, but I know plenty about you.

02:15.469 --> 02:18.005
The businesses
that you sold to investors

02:18.038 --> 02:19.673
and then ran into the ground.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.142
That "run" for Congress.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.844
Sixth place, was it?

02:23.877 --> 02:25.112
And now this.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.113
For your information,

02:26.146 --> 02:28.316
this is
a top talk radio program.

02:28.349 --> 02:29.317
(chuckling):
In Maryland?

02:29.350 --> 02:31.819
Let's not mince words.

02:31.852 --> 02:36.123
Mr. Ryan, you are
a failed two-bit opportunist.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.892
You saw the wave
of anti-mutant hate after 7/15,

02:38.926 --> 02:39.993
and you have been trying
to ride it

02:40.027 --> 02:41.895
to fame and fortune ever since.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.131
Well, I've got great news.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.399
I'm here to help you.

02:45.433 --> 02:48.802
Mr. Ryan, I have been looking
for someone like you.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.804
Someone with your need.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.307
Someone with your raw ambition.

02:53.341 --> 02:57.911
And, not to mention, your face
is wasted on the radio.

02:57.945 --> 03:02.283
How would you like to be the
most important man in America?

03:04.218 --> 03:06.387
I can make it happen.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.223
(chuckles)
How exactly would you do that?

03:09.257 --> 03:11.425
Well, let's just say that...

03:11.459 --> 03:14.762
I have... abilities.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.897
Gifts.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.600
I'm not working with a mutant.

03:19.633 --> 03:20.668
I am a patriot.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.571
No, Mr. Ryan,
you are a salesman.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.177
And I've got something
for you to sell.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.859
You took your time.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.695
Yeah, well,
I don't have a bunch of freaks

03:47.728 --> 03:49.297
to teleport me through traffic.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.332
I took the Beltway, actually.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.935
We had to meet here?

03:54.968 --> 03:58.205
Oh, I thought that you might
appreciate the symbolism.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.040
A nation divided,

04:00.073 --> 04:03.377
a civil war for our time.

04:03.411 --> 04:05.813
I have a job for your Purifiers.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.589
-This is crazy.
-It's necessary.

04:15.623 --> 04:19.293
And it needs to happen quickly
and very, very quietly.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.128
That's a tall order.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.297
Anyone I send out
on this little errand,

04:23.331 --> 04:25.966
there's a good chance
they're not coming home.

04:25.999 --> 04:29.102
I'm supposed to convince men
to die for this?

04:30.137 --> 04:32.005
You might want to leave out
the dying part.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.107
Why don't you ask
your new puppet?

04:34.141 --> 04:35.443
Turner, is it?

04:35.476 --> 04:37.277
He's ambitious.
Promise him something.

04:37.311 --> 04:38.946
Promise him what?

04:38.979 --> 04:40.948
He's a broken-down
ex-Sentinel Services guy.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.617
I will leave the details to you.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.786
But this is an essential part
of the plan.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.288
Our plan.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.724
Get it done.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.837
(panting)

05:03.871 --> 05:06.039
(Andreas speaking German)

05:13.514 --> 05:14.648
(shuddering)

05:14.682 --> 05:16.149
She's getting worse.

05:16.183 --> 05:18.786
I knew she would,
but I had no other choice.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.554
You do realize
what we're up against?

05:20.588 --> 05:21.689
Clarice is gone,

05:21.722 --> 05:23.991
Marcos got shot trying
to protect Lorna,

05:24.024 --> 05:26.394
and you are taking away
our daughter's powers.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.128
She ran away, Cait.
They were pulling her

05:28.161 --> 05:30.531
-toward the Inner Circle.
-I-I get that it's

05:30.564 --> 05:31.732
a serious situation.
I just think

05:31.765 --> 05:34.167
it's crazy that
you're suppressing her powers,

05:34.201 --> 05:36.036
after what your father
did to you.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.471
She hadn't slept in days.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.407
I was afraid
we were gonna lose her forever.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.642
-The medicine was all we had.
-For how long?

05:41.675 --> 05:43.977
We don't even have enough serum
for you.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.513
(Lauren speaking German)

05:47.748 --> 05:49.983
What the hell was that?

05:50.017 --> 05:51.419
It's German.

05:51.452 --> 05:54.021
Reed, I am pretty sure
speaking German

05:54.054 --> 05:55.423
is not a normal drug reaction.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.824
What is going on?

05:56.857 --> 05:59.393
Lauren found a letter

05:59.427 --> 06:00.828
that my grandfather had hidden

06:00.861 --> 06:02.530
in a secret compartment
in the music box.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.197
-It was in German.
-Our daughter found

06:04.231 --> 06:07.034
a secret message from
your mass murderer grandfather,

06:07.067 --> 06:09.202
a-and you didn't think
to mention it to me?

06:09.236 --> 06:10.838
-Things were happening so fast.
-These are the kind

06:10.871 --> 06:12.339
of things you tell your wife!

06:12.372 --> 06:15.075
(Lauren speaking German)

06:16.877 --> 06:19.747
(Lauren panting)

06:19.780 --> 06:22.282
ESME:
We waited for Lauren for hours.
We had her.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.617
I don't know.
Something went wrong.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.218
More like everything went wrong.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.220
Things are coming together.
We're about to change the world.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.523
I don't need excuses.
Understood?

06:29.557 --> 06:31.124
Of course.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.461
Your efforts with the Strucker
girl will have to wait.

06:33.494 --> 06:37.531
We need to put our own house
in order.

06:37.565 --> 06:38.932
Thank you all for coming.

06:38.966 --> 06:41.702
A situation has come up
that is concerning.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.804
Max went out last night.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.272
He hasn't come back.

06:46.674 --> 06:48.041
ANDY:
So, he's missing?

06:48.075 --> 06:49.376
Like he-he disappeared?

06:49.409 --> 06:51.445
We're not sure.
We're searching for him now.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.446
We don't know if it's serious.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.747
Of course it's serious.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.616
If you people let something
happen to him...

06:55.649 --> 06:57.217
Hey, it's not our fault
if he left the building.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.887
Our security system
is at least 98% impenetrable.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.289
Okay, well, someone penetrated
it. He's not just gonna run off.

07:02.322 --> 07:03.557
And if someone
hit him out there,

07:03.591 --> 07:04.792
it means they knew
where he was going.

07:04.825 --> 07:05.993
POLARIS:
Okay, let's just calm down.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.295
Chances are he's sleeping off
a bender.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.464
Let's hope that's all it is.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.065
ESME:
We've increased security.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.100
For now.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.401
REEVA:
If you know something,

07:14.434 --> 07:15.669
you know how to find us.

07:31.384 --> 07:32.920
THUNDERBIRD: Trying to make that
ring with your mind?

07:32.953 --> 07:36.490
(chuckles)
Yeah, kinda.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.293
How you doing, man?

07:40.327 --> 07:42.295
Well, I got shot.

07:42.329 --> 07:43.664
You're lucky it wasn't serious.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.432
I still haven't heard
from Lorna.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.100
Could be a lot of reasons
for that.

07:47.134 --> 07:50.137
(groans) And about 50 of them
involve her getting killed.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.039
You know, she doesn't even know
that things went sideways

07:52.072 --> 07:53.674
when I tried to grab Max.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.308
(sighs)

07:55.342 --> 07:57.044
She's out there alone.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.445
Lorna is gonna be fine.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.480
Okay? She could always
handle herself.

08:00.514 --> 08:04.284
I remember how angry you were
when Lorna left.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.119
I thought to myself,
there's nothing

08:06.153 --> 08:08.488
Clarice could ever do
to make me that mad.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.691
I was wrong.

08:10.724 --> 08:13.226
Hey, John.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.528
(strained exhale)

08:14.562 --> 08:16.730
She still cares about you.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.165
I could see it.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.667
Then why did she leave?

08:19.700 --> 08:22.570
Lorna left for the dream
of a mutant homeland,

08:22.603 --> 08:24.037
and Clarice runs off
with a bunch of strangers

08:24.071 --> 08:26.073
who don't believe in anything
but hiding in the dark.

08:26.106 --> 08:29.476
Well, at least she's safe.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.878
Believe it or not, she's there

08:30.911 --> 08:33.080
because she wants
to help people.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.383
(indistinct chatter)

08:42.522 --> 08:44.792
-Hey, Blink.
-Hey.

08:49.563 --> 08:51.264
I know you guys
have strict rules

08:51.298 --> 08:52.766
about who gets
to come down here.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.201
But at this point
we are sitting

08:54.234 --> 08:56.236
in the safest place in the city.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.872
If we can bring more mutants
down, even just temporarily...

08:58.906 --> 09:01.408
You're talking about going
against everything we stand for.

09:01.441 --> 09:02.876
No, I'm talking
about saving lives.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.177
I know the Morlocks
did this kind

09:04.211 --> 09:06.513
-of thing in the past...
-That was a long time ago.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.215
And you aren't seeing
what's going on now.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.884
-That supply run. The cops...
-We've dealt with cops before.

09:10.918 --> 09:14.554
They didn't even try to arrest
us before they shot Glow.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.590
Thanks to you and your friend,
she's fine.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.058
She's with the Morlocks
in Pittsburgh,

09:18.091 --> 09:19.059
where a healing mutant...

09:19.092 --> 09:20.293
This isn't just about Glow.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.963
Everyone on the surface
is in danger.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.598
If we don't open our doors...

09:24.632 --> 09:27.134
This is a community,
not a refugee camp.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.401
People come here because

09:28.435 --> 09:30.237
-it's a place where they belong.
-Besides,

09:30.270 --> 09:31.605
we don't have the resources.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.106
Then let's get more resources.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.042
There are people up there
who hate mutants.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.376
They want to wipe us out.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.778
If we're only gonna protect
ourselves,

09:37.811 --> 09:39.246
what kind of community is that?

09:47.855 --> 09:50.557
JACE:
So they're really living
in the sewers?

09:50.590 --> 09:51.892
Afraid so.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.895
Mutant separatists living
right under our feet.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.230
Parasites. Criminals.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.565
I mean,
I heard about the Morlocks

09:58.598 --> 09:59.967
when I was in Sentinel Services,

10:00.000 --> 10:01.301
but nobody could ever find 'em.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.970
Where'd you get this intel from?

10:03.003 --> 10:04.838
A well-placed source.

10:04.872 --> 10:08.308
I want you to put together
a team to go down there

10:08.341 --> 10:10.277
and clear them out.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.413
Clear 'em out?

10:13.446 --> 10:14.682
What are you talking about?
Nobody's ever

10:14.715 --> 10:16.283
even put a Morlock in custody.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.618
Which is why they're laughing
at us from their sewers.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.587
Okay, but sending in
a hit team--

10:20.620 --> 10:22.189
that's crossing a line.
I mean, last time I checked,

10:22.222 --> 10:23.857
it's still against the law
to shoot people.

10:23.891 --> 10:26.626
We're not talking
about upstanding citizens here.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.364
The Morlocks are the worst
of the worst.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.268
I know it's a lot to ask.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.670
(scoffs)

10:36.704 --> 10:39.272
You remember when we first met
at that barbershop?

10:39.306 --> 10:40.808
I was looking for a face
for our movement.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.542
You wanted to deal
with the mutant problem,

10:42.575 --> 10:45.212
to do what Sentinel Services
couldn't.

10:45.245 --> 10:48.248
And to get justice
for your little girl.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.386
There aren't enough good men
out there, Mr. Turner.

10:53.420 --> 10:56.323
But you are one of the best
I've ever met.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.726
When this is done,

10:58.759 --> 11:00.828
I promise you,
you won't just have a job

11:00.861 --> 11:02.830
at Sentinel Services--
you can transform it

11:02.863 --> 11:05.398
into what it
always should have been.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.200
Because you'll be running it.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.514
(door opens)

11:57.084 --> 11:59.052
(sighs)

11:59.086 --> 12:00.520
What do you mean
the elevator's not working?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.522
It's for security purposes.
I'm sorry.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.624
Until we get
this Max situation resolved,

12:04.657 --> 12:06.359
Reeva doesn't want
anyone going anywhere.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.261
Or calling anyone.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.397
-I noticed
the phones are down, too.
-Nothing in or out.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.399
Yeah, but why? I mean,
it's not like Reeva suspects

12:12.432 --> 12:14.201
-somebody here, does she?
-She's just being careful.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.235
POLARIS:
She should've been careful
when recruiting

12:15.268 --> 12:17.070
that psychopath drunk.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.907
I'm sorry, okay?
This wasn't my decision.

12:22.675 --> 12:25.145
WILSON:
All right, listen up.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.314
This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.983
Nobody has ever taken on
these Morlocks before.

12:30.017 --> 12:32.752
Not the cops.
Not Sentinel Services.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.654
Nobody.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.289
We're gonna be breaking
into two groups.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.725
Most of you are gonna be
on the teams

12:38.758 --> 12:40.760
that block all the exits
of the tunnels around the city.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.129
Now, I'm gonna need volunteers
for the group

12:42.162 --> 12:44.231
that's going down there with me,
and I'm not gonna lie to you--

12:44.264 --> 12:45.332
it's gonna be dangerous.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.467
We're gonna be hunting monsters
down there.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.569
But that's why this job fell
to us, right?

12:49.602 --> 12:50.971
(Purifiers muttering)

12:51.004 --> 12:53.640
Look, I'm scared. I'm...

12:53.673 --> 12:56.143
I'm dreading every second
we're gonna be down there.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.911
But I'm doing this for a reason.

12:57.945 --> 13:02.282
I'm doing this for my daughter
Grace, who died on 7/15.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.953
I'm doing it for my grandson.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.787
He's about to be born.

13:07.821 --> 13:08.856
I'm in.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.658
I'm doing it for my country.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.026
For my species.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.295
-For my family.
-For our future.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.398
Thank you for your service.

13:31.845 --> 13:35.782
I want to go down there
with you.

13:35.815 --> 13:40.187
I got more combat experience
in Iraq than any of these guys.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.389
No, Ted, I need you running the
teams blocking the tunnel exits.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.058
Yeah, Mike and Don got
that covered.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.660
A cockroach won't be able
to get out.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.199
After what happened
at the youth center...

13:56.603 --> 13:58.205
That's why I have to do this.

13:58.238 --> 14:01.074
Jace, I screwed up down there.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.576
Only reason
I'm not in jail is you.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.113
I just want a chance to have
your back like you had mine.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.907
All right, let's move out.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.876
CAITLIN:
Drink slowly.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.711
How are you feeling?

14:38.745 --> 14:40.447
(exhales)

14:40.480 --> 14:42.482
A little bit better.

14:44.084 --> 14:47.354
Your father told me
about the dreams with Andy.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.557
-How you almost...
-Went to the Inner Circle?

14:50.590 --> 14:52.792
Yeah.

14:52.825 --> 14:55.262
Thank goodness they found you.

14:55.295 --> 14:58.798
-I never should've left.
-Mm, it's not your fault.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.733
(sighs)

15:00.767 --> 15:04.471
And now I'm hearing about
this letter and the music box.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.439
I mean, apparently,
you're bilingual now

15:06.473 --> 15:08.608
because you were speaking German
in your sleep.

15:08.641 --> 15:09.876
I was?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.611
Look on the bright side.

15:11.644 --> 15:15.548
Remember all of those Spanish
tests I bombed at school?

15:15.582 --> 15:19.319
I read one letter and boom--
speak German.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.721
Look, if that's the problem,

15:21.754 --> 15:23.756
then let's get rid
of the damn thing.

15:23.790 --> 15:24.791
I don't think it is.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.060
The letter, the music box,

15:27.094 --> 15:29.963
researching
our family's history...

15:29.997 --> 15:32.665
made me feel stronger.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.734
And I liked it.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.470
I saw that you liked it.

15:37.504 --> 15:41.041
We talked about needing
to be strong for Andy, and...

15:42.709 --> 15:44.677
...I didn't have a choice.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.713
God.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.784
I'm so sorry, Lauren.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.128
(Caitlin sighs)

16:01.161 --> 16:02.996
The dose is wearing off.

16:05.865 --> 16:08.201
We're gonna have
to figure out what to do

16:08.235 --> 16:11.638
about her situation soon.
And yours.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.507
Cait, the music box
and the letter--

16:14.541 --> 16:16.543
it didn't only affect Lauren.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.679
Did your powers manifest again?

16:19.712 --> 16:21.048
Yeah.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.682
-But it's not just that.
-(exhales)

16:22.715 --> 16:24.351
It brought something out of me,

16:24.384 --> 16:27.620
something that I thought
I'd buried a long time ago.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.123
It is so...

16:30.157 --> 16:32.225
powerful,

16:32.259 --> 16:34.327
so overwhelming.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.363
That was why I gave Lauren
the serum.

16:36.396 --> 16:39.199
We all have a darkness inside.

16:39.232 --> 16:42.169
No serum is gonna control that.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.837
Look, I-I've done things
I'm not proud of.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.906
-What do you mean?
-When we went to Atlanta

16:46.939 --> 16:49.142
to talk to my brother,

16:49.176 --> 16:51.744
we had to fight off
Sentinel Services.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.847
I encouraged Lauren to be more
aggressive, I pushed her.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.383
I wanted her to fight.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.251
Well, I've been watching
you training.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.852
You've been
pushing yourself, too.

16:59.886 --> 17:02.222
Maybe I have.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.194
You don't know what it's like
to be the only non-mutant here.

17:07.227 --> 17:10.330
I shouldn't have blamed you
for what happened to her.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.166
I-I'm just worried.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.269
If we're gonna give her
more medicine,

17:16.303 --> 17:18.605
it's gonna have to be soon.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.039
Reed, there's not enough.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.574
Cait...

17:23.943 --> 17:25.745
Make this about Lauren.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.780
(exhales sharply)

17:29.549 --> 17:31.118
I don't know.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.919
If we give it to her,

17:32.952 --> 17:35.555
it could put out the light
inside of her.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.690
But if we don't,

17:37.724 --> 17:40.593
we might lose her forever.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.498
(indistinct chatter)

17:52.305 --> 17:54.241
-Just a moment.
-Oh, sorry.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.276
-I, um...
-(chuckles)

17:56.309 --> 17:57.977
I didn't mean to barge in.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.413
It's fine. Come in.

18:00.447 --> 18:03.150
Uh...

18:03.183 --> 18:06.085
I just wanted to apologize
for earlier.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.754
I spent the last year watching

18:07.787 --> 18:09.656
the Mutant Underground
get destroyed.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.825
All the people we used to help
have nowhere to go.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.761
I know how much you care
about our mutant brothers

18:14.794 --> 18:16.563
and sisters, and I do, too,

18:16.596 --> 18:19.566
but if we change our entire way
of life, what do we stand for?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.268
I'm not saying that we should
all get jobs

18:21.301 --> 18:22.802
at Starbucks and buy condos.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.004
(chuckles)

18:25.037 --> 18:28.275
Blink, if there's any way
that we can help

18:28.308 --> 18:31.411
without compromising who we are
and what we believe,

18:31.444 --> 18:33.680
I'm willing to listen.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.849
Thank you.
That's all I wanted.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.518
MASON:
Erg.

18:40.853 --> 18:41.954
What is it? What's going on?

18:41.988 --> 18:43.523
Someone's in the tunnels.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.363
All right, everyone,
this is not the first time

18:50.397 --> 18:53.333
we've had intruders.
Membrain,

18:53.366 --> 18:55.835
what's the status?
Where are they now?

18:58.205 --> 19:00.006
MEMBRAIN:
In the south tunnel.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.709
That's Jace Turner.
Former Sentinel Services.

19:02.742 --> 19:03.976
Recently joined the Purifiers.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.545
He's the one that tortured John.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.247
This is exactly
what we planned for.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.149
Iris, can you hold them off?

19:10.183 --> 19:12.385
I'm putting up false walls,
trying to turn them around.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.787
He took down the Mutant
Underground in Atlanta.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.190
-We had to evacuate.
-MASON: That won't happen here.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.959
The tunnels are still connected
to the city's water system.

19:19.992 --> 19:23.296
If it comes to it, we seal the
south tunnel and we flood it.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.164
Mason, take a team.
Hit them hard.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.866
Make sure they don't come back.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.203
We need to get the ones
who can't fight out of here--

19:30.237 --> 19:32.572
the children, the sick,
the elderly.

19:32.605 --> 19:33.873
Can you?

19:33.906 --> 19:36.643
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.944
Let's move out.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.998
JACE:
Hold up, hold up.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.834
This doesn't match
the intel that I got.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.103
We've been in this tunnel
before?

20:04.136 --> 20:06.072
Seems like we keep turning
the same direction.

20:06.105 --> 20:07.707
They moving the walls somehow?

20:07.740 --> 20:09.709
Moving that much concrete would
be one hell of an ability,

20:09.742 --> 20:11.744
even for a mutant.
It's got to be something else.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.713
-Like what?
-I don't know.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.820
When it comes to mutants,
I never trust what I see.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.066
Lead on.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.415
(line ringing)

20:51.017 --> 20:53.553
(phone vibrating)

20:53.586 --> 20:55.888
-Who is this?
-It's Blink.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.990
I mean, Clarice.
Look, I need your help.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.792
Okay, I-I would have called
John, but...

20:59.826 --> 21:01.394
Look, it's fine.
What's going on?

21:01.428 --> 21:02.762
Purifiers are in the tunnels.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.331
-Jace Turner is leading them.
-How?

21:04.364 --> 21:05.965
I thought no one could
get to them down there.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.900
I know, I thought so, too.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.437
There are people down here
who can't fight.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.071
I-I can take them to the alley

21:12.104 --> 21:13.340
by the old utility plant, but...

21:13.373 --> 21:16.476
Uh, okay, okay, we'll-we'll get
there as soon as we can.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.411
That was Clarice.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.279
-She called you?
-Yeah.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.181
The Purifiers are hitting
the Morlocks.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.351
She needs our help.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.487
REEVA:
I have some bad news.
Max is dead.

21:27.520 --> 21:30.357
What the hell do you mean,
Max is dead?

21:30.390 --> 21:31.958
REEVA:
Look, I know you're upset.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.526
HEATHER (distant):
Yeah, we're a lot more
than upset.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.562
REEVA (fading):
We all want answers
and we will get answers.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.165
All we know for sure
is that he died

21:39.198 --> 21:41.434
in a car fire
at a nearby liquor store.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.302
-Yeah, but did somebody
kill him, or...?
-REEVA: We don't know.

21:43.336 --> 21:44.871
It may have been an accident,
but the girls

21:44.904 --> 21:46.373
-are looking for witnesses.
-HEATHER: Yeah, no way.

21:46.406 --> 21:47.940
-This was a hit.
-You sure?

21:47.974 --> 21:49.376
I mean, the guy liked
to blow stuff up.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.878
-He makes a mistake-- boom.
-He didn't make mistakes.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.312
-Do you know something
that we don't?
-Stop it.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.781
-HEATHER: Really,
you want to go there?
-ESME: Heather...

21:54.814 --> 21:57.149
I said to stop!
We are too close

21:57.183 --> 21:59.018
to our goal to fight
amongst ourselves.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.221
(exhales)

22:02.254 --> 22:04.991
We will get to the bottom
of this.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.026
No matter what it takes.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.872
REEVA:
Anything from the liquor store?

22:19.906 --> 22:22.141
-Phoebe and Sophie are looking.
-They need to push hard.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.243
They ransacked the cashier's
brain for hours, okay?

22:24.276 --> 22:26.846
The guy won't stop screaming.
He didn't see anything.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.415
-Esme...
-We're trying.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.749
Try harder!

22:29.782 --> 22:31.317
Someone knew
where Max was gonna be.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.886
I want to know who,
I want to know how,

22:33.920 --> 22:35.855
and I want them brought to me.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.393
-(elevator bell dings)
-(doors opening)

22:41.694 --> 22:44.931
Okay, well,
how many do you need?

22:44.964 --> 22:46.232
All right.

22:46.265 --> 22:47.934
Yeah. We'll figure it out.

22:47.967 --> 22:51.070
-What's happening?
-Another Purifier attack.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.605
They're hitting
the Morlocks this time.

22:52.639 --> 22:54.674
What? How did they
get caught up in this?

22:54.707 --> 22:56.676
John and Marcos are
on their way to help evacuate,

22:56.709 --> 22:57.944
and they need us, too.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.278
There's a whole city down there.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.614
Children. I...
Where are we gonna put them all?

23:01.648 --> 23:03.115
I don't know, the-the scrapyard
for a few days?

23:03.149 --> 23:05.117
After that-- uh, God knows.

23:05.151 --> 23:08.354
All right. Uh, one of us
should stay with Lauren.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.388
-All right.
-LAUREN: No.

23:10.823 --> 23:13.192
-I'm coming.
-Lauren, you can't go anywhere.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.360
You're still sick.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.895
-I'm feeling better.
-That's because

23:15.928 --> 23:17.430
the medication is wearing off.

23:17.464 --> 23:19.198
Your X-Gene is gonna start
expressing itself again.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.200
And if it does,
it's gonna make you vulnerable.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.202
The pull you felt
toward the Inner Circle,

23:23.235 --> 23:24.871
toward your brother,
it could come back, and...

23:24.904 --> 23:27.039
-without another dose...
-No.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.209
(sighs)
I don't want another dose.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.811
You sure about that?

23:31.844 --> 23:33.646
Yes. I think you're right.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.815
Situations like this,
people need help,

23:35.848 --> 23:37.484
I can't just sit here
and watch them suffer.

23:37.517 --> 23:38.951
I know it's dangerous.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.753
But I can't use the serum
as a crutch.

23:40.787 --> 23:43.155
I need to face this.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.991
Head-on.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.796
All right, then.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.599
Let's get moving.

24:10.349 --> 24:11.684
(whispers):
Go.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.686
Everybody stay sharp.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.387
On me. Let's go.

24:19.158 --> 24:21.528
(echoing screech)

24:21.561 --> 24:23.663
PURIFIER:
What was that?

24:26.666 --> 24:28.635
(whispers):
Come on.

24:32.505 --> 24:35.374
(echoing screeches)

24:35.407 --> 24:38.444
-CHIP: Where are they?
-Jace, I don't see anything!

24:38.477 --> 24:40.547
-What the hell, man?
-JACE: Calm down! Calm down!

24:40.580 --> 24:41.948
(low, echoing growls)

24:41.981 --> 24:44.116
They're just trying
to scare us off.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.519
First it was false walls,
now it's... noises in the dark.

24:46.553 --> 24:49.188
I've seen this before.
All we got to do is stay strong.

24:49.221 --> 24:52.224
-(screams)
-Everybody down!

24:52.258 --> 24:53.693
Hold your fire!

24:54.594 --> 24:55.762
Hold your fire!

24:58.164 --> 24:59.732
What the hell was that?

24:59.766 --> 25:01.568
-(screams)
-Jace! Behind us!

25:01.601 --> 25:02.735
Hold your fire!

25:02.769 --> 25:04.704
(echoing screeching, growling)

25:04.737 --> 25:05.772
They got Chip, too.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.710
What are we doing down here?
We're up against monsters.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.383
Hey, James, Faith.
Oh, you need to pack light.

25:17.416 --> 25:19.752
Okay? Just bring what you
can carry in your backpacks.

25:21.754 --> 25:24.356
Hey, Gabby, Mara, you guys are
in the first group. Let's go.

25:24.390 --> 25:26.358
-I know. She's just... scared.
-Well, there's nothing

25:26.392 --> 25:28.427
-to be scared of.
-All the exits are blocked.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.329
-If the Purifiers...
-I have a way around that.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.498
-Elizabeth?
-But it's just that Mara

25:32.531 --> 25:34.934
hasn't been on the surface
in years.

25:34.967 --> 25:37.069
Mara, this is my home, too.

25:37.103 --> 25:40.406
Okay? This is the first place
that I've ever truly belonged.

25:40.439 --> 25:42.842
You're gonna have to trust me.
We'll be back.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.711
Okay?

25:44.744 --> 25:46.913
Okay, we have to go now.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.347
Let's go.

25:56.322 --> 25:57.590
-Where's Clarice?
-I don't know.

25:57.624 --> 25:59.058
She said they'd be here.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.528
There.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.864
Hey! Cars are up here!
Let's go!

26:04.897 --> 26:07.433
Let's go! We got
to keep it tight! Let's move!

26:11.638 --> 26:13.740
You gonna be all right, man?

26:14.907 --> 26:17.209
Yeah, it's okay.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.647
I don't have an exact number,
but there are more down there.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.481
The Struckers are on their way.
We'll get everyone out.

26:22.514 --> 26:25.985
Thank you. I wa...
I wasn't sure you'd come.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.387
Clarice, look, the things...

26:28.420 --> 26:29.956
that I said and I did,

26:29.989 --> 26:33.760
maybe... someday,
when this is over...

26:34.794 --> 26:36.328
For now, let's focus on today.

26:36.362 --> 26:39.598
-I have to go.
-Next time...

26:39.632 --> 26:41.167
you call me.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.202
I will always come.

27:04.991 --> 27:06.325
(panting)

27:08.527 --> 27:10.129
We found them
in the next tunnel.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.664
Are they...

27:11.698 --> 27:12.832
Dead.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.867
(echoing screeches)

27:17.870 --> 27:20.306
We still got those canisters
of Halothane-X gas, right?

27:20.339 --> 27:22.608
-That'll knock 'em out.
-We only have a few canisters.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.443
We don't have enough
to fill a tunnel.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.145
We don't even know
where the hell they are.

27:26.178 --> 27:27.479
Maybe there's
something we can do.

27:27.513 --> 27:28.948
I learned a few tricks
in Fallujah.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.216
-What are you talking about?
-JACE: Shh.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.284
If we stay down here,
we're dead.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.386
He's right.
We can still go back.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.055
What, do you want to let
these men die for nothing?

27:36.088 --> 27:37.323
Go back to their families
and tell them what?

27:37.356 --> 27:38.357
Tell 'em we ran?
Tell 'em we left

27:38.390 --> 27:40.159
these things down here
under their feet?

27:40.192 --> 27:41.828
No, but you saw what happened.

27:41.861 --> 27:44.130
FRANK:
We're on their turf.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.497
They're just picking us off.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.307
All right, we need to decide,

27:55.341 --> 27:58.010
and we need to decide together.

27:58.044 --> 28:02.014
Do we move forward
or do we retreat?

28:05.584 --> 28:06.886
(elevator dings)

28:08.454 --> 28:11.223
(footsteps approaching)

28:15.127 --> 28:17.263
So how long is this gonna last?

28:17.296 --> 28:19.231
Excuse me?

28:19.265 --> 28:21.500
Whole place is shut down.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.602
People are asking questions,
checking computers.

28:23.635 --> 28:25.738
We said that there
would be security checks.

28:25.772 --> 28:28.007
Yeah, but you didn't say
you suspected one of us.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.375
How are we supposed
to fight a war for you

28:29.408 --> 28:30.709
if you don't trust us?

28:34.747 --> 28:37.884
I think you'd want to know if
someone stabbed us in the back.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.919
ESME:
Lorna.

28:39.952 --> 28:42.588
Would you excuse us?
We need to speak with Reeva.

28:50.129 --> 28:52.064
You have news?

28:52.098 --> 28:53.599
I'm afraid so.

28:53.632 --> 28:56.302
We checked
the computer's security log.

28:56.335 --> 28:59.071
And... what did you find?

29:01.007 --> 29:03.142
We found the spy.

29:14.821 --> 29:16.989
When you came to us,
you made a commitment.

29:17.023 --> 29:20.259
In exchange for the opportunity
to build a nation,

29:20.292 --> 29:22.094
all we asked for
was your loyalty.

29:22.128 --> 29:24.831
And you betrayed us.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.665
Reeva...

29:26.698 --> 29:28.600
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:28.634 --> 29:30.469
-I would nev...
-Sage, we know.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.404
Two hours before Max was killed,

29:32.438 --> 29:34.573
you accessed security footage
of him from this terminal.

29:34.606 --> 29:37.409
No.
Uh, there must be some mistake.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.111
-No mistake.
-Your password.

29:39.145 --> 29:41.780
-Your terminal.
-No one else had access.

29:41.814 --> 29:43.482
Interesting
that you were the one

29:43.515 --> 29:46.185
insisting that our security
was 98% impenetrable,

29:46.218 --> 29:48.454
that it was almost impossible
that Max could have been killed.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.322
Trying to protect yourself?

29:50.356 --> 29:53.192
-Reeva, I swear.
-It was a risk

29:53.225 --> 29:55.194
bringing you
into the Inner Circle.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.795
The girls objected,

29:56.829 --> 29:58.430
because the more technical
aspects of your brain

29:58.464 --> 29:59.832
made it difficult--

29:59.866 --> 30:02.168
impossible even--
for them to penetrate.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.771
(grunts softly)

30:05.804 --> 30:07.974
Just ones and zeros.

30:08.007 --> 30:09.808
REEVA:
I insisted

30:09.842 --> 30:11.610
that we needed your skills.

30:11.643 --> 30:14.480
I vouched for you.

30:15.514 --> 30:18.450
I... was wrong.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.887
Reeva, I didn't do this.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.089
How can I prove myself to you?

30:24.356 --> 30:26.458
That's just it.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.194
You can't.

30:31.830 --> 30:32.999
(singing high tone)

30:33.032 --> 30:34.600
(groaning)

30:40.539 --> 30:41.840
(Sage screams)

30:46.178 --> 30:47.880
(knocking)

30:54.553 --> 30:56.722
ANDY:
Lorna, open the door.

30:56.755 --> 30:58.224
(sighs)

30:58.257 --> 30:59.625
Andy.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.529
-What is it?
-It's Sage.

31:03.562 --> 31:04.730
Wh...

31:04.763 --> 31:07.699
What are you talking about?

31:07.733 --> 31:08.767
She was a spy.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.836
Th-That's impossible.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.105
Well, there's proof.
The Frosts figured it out.

31:13.139 --> 31:15.607
Sage checked her terminal
at the training room

31:15.641 --> 31:17.643
to see exactly when Max
was leaving the building.

31:19.745 --> 31:21.147
(quietly):
Yes.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.451
What's, uh...

31:25.484 --> 31:27.586
what's Reeva doing?

31:28.620 --> 31:30.089
What... It's already done.

31:31.991 --> 31:33.392
Sage is dead.

31:34.994 --> 31:37.396
I mean, they had to.

31:37.429 --> 31:38.897
She betrayed us.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.866
Max is dead because of her.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.069
(crying):
No.

31:56.115 --> 31:59.651
Hey, guys, before we get there,
I want to talk about something.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.253
What is it?

32:01.287 --> 32:03.255
It's about the serum.

32:03.289 --> 32:05.891
I know you're worried,
but I've made up my mind--

32:05.924 --> 32:07.793
I'm not running from this.

32:07.826 --> 32:10.829
It's not that.
In fact, I realized...

32:10.862 --> 32:12.631
you're right.

32:12.664 --> 32:16.202
And... I'm gonna stop taking
the serum, too.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.305
-What?
-When you think about

32:19.338 --> 32:21.340
everything that's happened...

32:21.373 --> 32:24.310
it all comes down to this:
one way or another,

32:24.343 --> 32:27.579
I have spent my entire life
fighting the X-Gene.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.848
And I'm beginning to realize
how much it's cost me,

32:29.881 --> 32:32.351
how much it's cost all of us.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.586
The lies and-and the denial

32:34.620 --> 32:37.323
and the-the constant
battle with myself.

32:37.356 --> 32:40.126
And listening
to you today, Lauren,

32:40.159 --> 32:43.595
I realized that
it's a part of who I am...

32:43.629 --> 32:45.897
for better or worse.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.500
Reed...

32:48.534 --> 32:52.304
if you stop taking the serum,
you could die.

32:52.338 --> 32:53.872
It's gonna run out eventually.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.643
He's right.

32:59.145 --> 33:00.846
This is who we are.

33:02.481 --> 33:05.551
I've been given these powers
for a reason...

33:05.584 --> 33:08.887
and it's time for me to work out
what that reason is.

33:09.921 --> 33:11.723
You're sure about this?

33:13.392 --> 33:15.361
I'm sure.

33:20.066 --> 33:22.068
All right.

33:24.070 --> 33:26.372
Powers it is.

33:28.874 --> 33:31.043
What's the status?
Are they coming closer?

33:32.411 --> 33:34.046
MEMBRAIN:
No.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.747
No, no.
From what I can see,

33:35.781 --> 33:36.982
it looks like
they're retreating.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.150
BLINK:
Are you sure?

33:38.184 --> 33:39.851
Jace isn't the retreating type.

33:39.885 --> 33:42.188
-Something's going on.
-Nah, we've got this.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.190
Hit 'em hard, Mason.

33:44.223 --> 33:45.657
On it.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.727
We'll make sure
they don't change their minds.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.670
Search the bodies.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.839
Any IDs or walkies,
any intelligence,

34:00.872 --> 34:02.941
we get it to Erg right away.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.252
Run!

34:13.285 --> 34:15.621
(all shouting, clamoring)

34:15.654 --> 34:17.856
(shouting)

34:17.889 --> 34:19.891
(coughing)

34:24.330 --> 34:25.664
(panting)

34:28.066 --> 34:29.301
ERG:
What's going on?

34:29.335 --> 34:30.869
Mason?

34:30.902 --> 34:32.304
They booby-trapped the bodies.

34:32.338 --> 34:34.140
Halothane-X gas grenades.

34:34.173 --> 34:35.641
W-Who's left?

34:35.674 --> 34:37.443
(coughs)
The gas got the others.

34:37.476 --> 34:39.111
-(gunfire)
-They're killing them.

34:39.145 --> 34:40.879
(coughing)

34:40.912 --> 34:43.382
Get to the pump room.
We have to flood the tunnels.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.584
-(gunfire continues)
-I'm... (coughing)

34:45.617 --> 34:47.653
I barely got away from the gas.

34:47.686 --> 34:50.088
Well, how close are you?

34:50.122 --> 34:51.323
They're coming.

34:51.357 --> 34:52.991
Mason.

34:53.024 --> 34:54.726
Mason, are you in yet?

34:54.760 --> 34:58.096
(men shouting in distance)

35:01.367 --> 35:02.734
(men shouting)

35:02.768 --> 35:04.002
Erg...

35:05.604 --> 35:07.439
...I'm-I'm sorry.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.975
-I'm so sorry.
-(gunfire)

35:10.008 --> 35:11.410
(static)

35:11.443 --> 35:13.345
My God.

35:15.013 --> 35:16.348
We might still be able
to flood the tunnels, I might

35:16.382 --> 35:18.750
-be able to get
to the pump room.
-Erg, that's impossible.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.086
We have to evacuate.
They're closing in.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.921
I'm sorry. I know you don't want
to lose this place.

35:22.954 --> 35:25.857
Neither do I. But we have to
keep all of these people alive.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.765
Okay, we have to barricade
the entrance to the city.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.702
We'll hold them off
as long as we can.

35:46.378 --> 35:48.847
-We dropped the first group off
at the scrapyard.
-How many more?

35:48.880 --> 35:50.349
We don't know, but it doesn't
sound good. Clarice said

35:50.382 --> 35:52.150
-they're evacuating everyone.
-Do you know

35:52.184 --> 35:54.620
-how many people that is?
-John, we don't
have enough space.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.188
-One problem at a time.
-All right.

35:56.222 --> 35:57.656
Over here! Let's go!

35:57.689 --> 35:59.157
-Let's go! Let's go!
-I'll get the back.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.527
-Find your space. Let's move.
-Come on.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.662
Cops are already on their way.
We got to get you out of here.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.197
No. I have to bring up
the others.

36:05.231 --> 36:08.033
-I'm their only way out.
-Let me come with you.

36:08.066 --> 36:10.001
John, you have to make sure
these people get to safety.

36:10.035 --> 36:11.803
What about you, right?
You're the one that said

36:11.837 --> 36:13.739
there's nothing noble
about fighting for a lost cause.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.042
I was wrong.

36:17.075 --> 36:18.410
I'm sorry.

36:20.846 --> 36:21.980
(scoffs)

36:22.013 --> 36:24.916
Clarice, wait!

36:34.293 --> 36:36.928
(indistinct chatter)

36:39.231 --> 36:41.900
Hurry! Seal off the entrance!

36:45.404 --> 36:48.540
Fall back!
Take up positions!

36:48.574 --> 36:50.676
How much longer?

36:50.709 --> 36:51.977
They're at the junction.

36:53.312 --> 36:55.747
-We need to get you guys
out of here.
-Get the others.

36:55.781 --> 36:58.817
We'll buy you time.
Hurry.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.258
Everybody, this way.

37:06.292 --> 37:08.460
Blink, over here!

37:08.494 --> 37:10.896
Okay, sorry. Excuse me.

37:10.929 --> 37:12.130
Okay, stand back.

37:14.433 --> 37:15.801
(grunts)

37:15.834 --> 37:17.803
Okay, go! Hurry!

37:19.638 --> 37:21.273
Closer.

37:21.307 --> 37:24.310
Almost... almost here.

37:31.016 --> 37:32.017
(explosion)

37:59.645 --> 38:01.913
Stay down!
Everyone, stay down.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.983
Go! Go! Go! Reload! Reload!

38:05.016 --> 38:07.285
(grunts)

38:07.319 --> 38:08.854
Jace, look out!

38:21.367 --> 38:23.001
-We got him!
-Chris!

38:41.252 --> 38:42.220
(growls)

38:42.253 --> 38:44.122
Everybody down!

38:44.155 --> 38:45.424
(shouts)

38:48.727 --> 38:51.830
Go! Run down
to the end of the alley.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.669
All right, if you can run fast,
head south.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.004
The police aren't there yet.

38:59.037 --> 39:00.839
There's some abandoned buildings
where you can hide. Go.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.708
Get in here!
Okay, squeeze in tight.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.976
-You're gonna be okay.
-We're gonna get you safe.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.379
The cars are full!
We need to move!

39:07.413 --> 39:09.180
-Cops are almost here.
-I'm not leaving without her!

39:09.214 --> 39:11.216
-What? You can't just...
-I'm not leaving
without Clarice!

39:11.249 --> 39:14.420
Caitlin, take John's car.

39:14.453 --> 39:15.854
Come on, ride with me!

39:26.364 --> 39:28.133
(sirens wailing in distance)

39:33.539 --> 39:35.273
Come on.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.845
-Come on, damn it.
-Mom, they're coming.
What are we gonna do?

39:39.878 --> 39:41.447
We can still get out of here.

39:44.416 --> 39:46.552
(siren chirps)

39:51.890 --> 39:53.124
Can anyone here fight?

39:53.158 --> 39:55.360
All the fighters
are in the tunnels.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.028
Lauren, try to use your powers.

39:57.062 --> 40:00.432
(grunts)
I can't reach them.

40:00.466 --> 40:01.867
Everyone, out of the car!

40:01.900 --> 40:04.369
Hands on your head, right now!

40:04.402 --> 40:07.238
-We can negotiate.
-COP: This is your last warning.

40:07.272 --> 40:08.707
Leave your vehicle now.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.977
No.
They're not gonna negotiate.

40:12.010 --> 40:14.112
And neither are we.

40:16.014 --> 40:17.382
-Get down, all of you.
-What are you gonna do?

40:17.415 --> 40:19.284
-Just do it!
-Mom!

40:19.317 --> 40:20.452
Get down! Take cover!

40:33.499 --> 40:34.966
-Move! Move!
-Go!

40:44.309 --> 40:45.777
(sirens wailing)

40:45.811 --> 40:47.445
They're coming!

40:49.648 --> 40:50.949
Hold your fire!

40:50.982 --> 40:53.652
Stop shooting the one with the
eye patch! Focus on the others.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.521
What are you saying? That
son of a bitch killed Chris!

40:55.554 --> 40:57.589
He's redirecting the energy
of the bullets somehow.

40:57.623 --> 40:59.290
Shoot the other ones!

41:05.063 --> 41:06.665
(grunts)

41:08.567 --> 41:11.036
You want to shoot someone,
shoot me!

41:12.738 --> 41:13.739
(groaning)

41:15.206 --> 41:18.276
No! Cowards!

41:18.309 --> 41:20.378
(gunfire continuing)

41:23.414 --> 41:26.184
(grunts)

41:33.224 --> 41:36.227
Erg! We have to go.
It's over!

41:38.830 --> 41:40.231
You first.

41:40.265 --> 41:42.400
I have to be the last one out.

41:42.433 --> 41:43.702
(Faith crying)

41:43.735 --> 41:45.571
BLINK:
What is she doing here?

41:45.604 --> 41:48.406
Faith! Stay there!

41:48.439 --> 41:51.509
Stay right there. Don't move.

41:53.545 --> 41:55.013
PURIFIER:
They're retreating!
Move forward!

41:59.184 --> 42:00.518
Let's go.

42:07.025 --> 42:09.260
Clarice, come on.

42:16.367 --> 42:19.104
(gunshot echoes)

42:23.809 --> 42:26.645
No!

43:57.535 --> 43:59.504
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:01.907 --> 44:04.042
It's time to pick a side
on The Gifted.

44:04.075 --> 44:06.377
Here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.415
Welcome to the galaxy.

44:11.649 --> 44:13.584
Should be fun. I'll lead.

44:15.420 --> 44:18.323
* We're breaking waves
Shooting stars *

44:18.356 --> 44:19.691
We're gonna make a run for it.

44:19.725 --> 44:20.959
* Live for glory, not forever *

44:20.992 --> 44:25.396
-Go!
-* Reach out *

44:25.430 --> 44:29.000
* Make this right here
Right now *

44:29.034 --> 44:32.804
