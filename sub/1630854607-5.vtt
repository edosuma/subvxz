WEBVTT

00:04.754 --> 00:06.464
<i>That was the fifth expert</i>

00:06.464 --> 00:07.632
to dismiss my theory.

00:07.632 --> 00:09.467
Your grandfather left you his house.

00:09.467 --> 00:12.262
There's probate,
renovations, tax liabilities.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.347
<i>Peter may have been off
his rocker for the past few years.</i>

00:14.347 --> 00:16.975
That doesn't mean his death
doesn't deserve to be investigated.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.226
<i>I'll support you a hundred percent.</i>

00:18.226 --> 00:19.894
<i>The rando hipster guy
who we thought</i>

00:19.894 --> 00:21.938
was following us to Graceland?
He was following us.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.732
Billie really is still keeping tabs on us.

00:23.732 --> 00:26.484
- What is this place?
- Sadusky's Clue Room.

00:26.484 --> 00:27.986
- It's locked.
- <i>Intruder lockdown.</i>

00:27.986 --> 00:29.320
- Help!
- Help!

00:29.320 --> 00:32.782
Ben's family tried to crack the clue
about The Charlotte for three generations.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.117
He thought it was a woman.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.493
The Charlotte was a ship.

00:35.493 --> 00:37.829
The twin-tongued serpent was Sacagawea.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.081
<i>Intruder lockdown canceled.</i>

00:40.081 --> 00:42.959
Sacagawea hid the clue
in the journal Meriwether

00:42.959 --> 00:44.711
dedicated to his Newfoundland dog.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.589
The journal is at the governor's mansion.

00:47.589 --> 00:48.965
Aren't you glad we never dated?

00:48.965 --> 00:49.883
Yeah.

00:49.883 --> 00:50.800
Like Meena?

00:50.800 --> 00:52.761
- How long have you guys been dating?
- About six weeks.

00:52.761 --> 00:53.720
You must really like her.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.305
There's no greater treasure
than lost time.

00:56.097 --> 00:59.142
Not only do I have two pieces
of the treasure map,

00:59.142 --> 01:01.644
I've just acquired a clue to the third.

01:01.644 --> 01:03.938
No one knows about that recording
except me and my friends.

01:03.938 --> 01:04.981
One of your friends

01:04.981 --> 01:06.524
<i>may not be your friend.</i>

01:13.073 --> 01:16.117
That girl stole this from Graceland?

01:16.993 --> 01:18.119
Wow, she's scrappy.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.329
You gotta give her that.

01:19.329 --> 01:22.332
Well, that little girl may be scrappy,
but she's no match for my tech.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.500
Watch this.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.336
The feathered serpent.

01:26.336 --> 01:30.882
An ancient Mayan snake deity that appears
only twice a year during the equinoxes.

01:30.882 --> 01:34.636
See, when the sun sets,
the serpent descends the steps.

01:35.136 --> 01:37.597
It's an illusion caused by the angle
of the sun

01:37.597 --> 01:39.599
and the shadow cast by the temple.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.476
Pretty amazing, right?

01:41.476 --> 01:44.187
Let me just figure out exactly
where this is.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.939
It's Chichen Itza.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.858
Temple of Kukulkán.

01:50.110 --> 01:55.323
Look, all this would be incredible
if we were looking for a serpent's tail.

01:55.323 --> 01:56.699
T-A-I-L.

01:56.699 --> 01:59.744
But I think the Elvis clue
was referring to a tale.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.663
T-A-L-E.

02:01.663 --> 02:05.959
Written by the twin-tongued serpent,
Cortés's translator

02:05.959 --> 02:11.297
and member of the Daughters
of the Plumed Serpent, Malinche.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.174
Oh.

02:13.174 --> 02:14.134
Oh?

02:14.134 --> 02:16.678
"Oh" isn't gonna find it for us, Dario.

02:18.721 --> 02:19.973
Seriously, Wikipedia?

02:19.973 --> 02:21.599
This is your "high tech," Dario?

02:21.599 --> 02:23.935
Um...

02:23.935 --> 02:28.773
The Azcatitlan Codex mentioned Malinche,
but there's nothing written by Malinche.

02:28.773 --> 02:32.235
According to the history
written by the conquistadors.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.696
But maybe there's a codex
that nobody knows about.

02:34.696 --> 02:37.240
If nobody knows about it,
how are we gonna find it?

02:37.240 --> 02:41.327
Because we have well-to-do friends
in low places.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.831
Sweeping for bugs is a waste of time.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.791
Five minutes ago,
you were convinced it was Liam.

02:46.791 --> 02:47.959
I know.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.546
But I can't just accuse him of something
that I'm not sure of.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.131
Well, we weren't bugged.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.507
Liam's not a traitor.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.302
He's doing this for his dad,
just like I am.

02:57.927 --> 02:58.970
What about Oren?

02:59.554 --> 03:00.555
He's an oversharer.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.056
And we did play him the clue
the other night.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.392
Nope. I already checked
his conspiracy subreddits.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.686
Just his usual fringe theories there.

03:08.229 --> 03:09.439
You're the history buff.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.858
Liam is our Benedict Arnold.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.069
- It's Liam.
- Ah...

03:15.653 --> 03:17.071
Don't answer that honeypot.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.449
What is he saying?

03:20.366 --> 03:22.368
He wants me to go
to the governor's mansion with him

03:22.368 --> 03:24.204
to check out Meriwether Lewis's Journal.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.914
Just ghost him.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.208
But why would he ask me to go with him
if he's the mole?

03:28.208 --> 03:31.461
He's clearly using you
to feed information to Billie.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.213
What if I'm wrong about Sacagawea?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.590
I need to look at Lewis's journal
and find that clue.

03:36.090 --> 03:37.634
Something tells me I better do it now.

03:41.304 --> 03:44.265
I have three million, four to my right.

03:44.265 --> 03:46.100
Five, do I have five?

03:46.100 --> 03:47.518
Uh, six in the front.

03:47.518 --> 03:49.520
Beautiful pieces.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.565
You know, the last time I saw them,
they were at the British Museum.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.818
And now they're here
at your little black-market auction.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.737
Don't worry, I won't tell.

03:57.737 --> 03:58.947
Ms. Pearce.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.865
To what do we owe the pleasure?

04:00.865 --> 04:02.450
I come bearing gifts.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.955
The one thing you've wanted
for a long time.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.918
It belonged
to the most infamous Roman emperor.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.544
Caligula's lost mosaic.

04:13.544 --> 04:17.257
It adorned the bow
of one of his floating palaces.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.508
Don't touch.

04:18.508 --> 04:21.010
A pleasure barge of sorts.

04:21.010 --> 04:25.181
Who knew one of history's most cruel
and unpredictable leaders

04:25.181 --> 04:26.975
was also a boat guy?

04:26.975 --> 04:28.226
What do you want for it?

04:28.810 --> 04:30.728
Malinche's lost codex.

04:30.728 --> 04:31.854
That doesn't exist.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.564
I know you have it.

04:33.564 --> 04:35.191
Whoever told you that lied.

04:35.191 --> 04:36.776
Then the deal is off.

04:38.027 --> 04:42.198
You have no idea
how many so-called experts assured me

04:42.198 --> 04:45.076
there was no Malinche Codex.

04:45.660 --> 04:46.869
Lost or otherwise.

04:46.869 --> 04:49.038
It's actually not a codex.

04:49.038 --> 04:51.040
It's Cortés's journal.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.252
Malinche made several entries
in the Nahuatl language.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.212
Here and here.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.469
So she really did teach herself
how to write.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.221
Amazing.

05:06.055 --> 05:09.392
Don't you just love a persistent woman?

06:29.889 --> 06:32.975
<i>♪ She sits up high... ♪</i>

06:33.851 --> 06:35.061
You're awfully quiet.

06:37.730 --> 06:38.564
Come on. What's up?

06:39.273 --> 06:40.733
Billie got the Elvis clue.

06:41.192 --> 06:42.360
Somebody leaked it.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.195
Oh, that's bad.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.488
Gets worse.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.572
We think...

06:46.572 --> 06:48.449
Actually, Tasha's convinced it's...

06:48.449 --> 06:49.575
Liam?

06:51.285 --> 06:52.453
You went there fast.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.705
Do you think it's him?

06:55.289 --> 06:56.207
No.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.585
Liam opened his entire Clue Room to us.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.295
Why would a traitor do that?

07:02.338 --> 07:04.715
Look, I know you like him, and I get it.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.843
He seems like a good guy, but...

07:07.760 --> 07:09.345
I just don't think we can rule him out.

07:12.473 --> 07:14.350
<i>Welcome to the Governor's Mansion.</i>

07:14.350 --> 07:17.311
<i>Please only stay
on the designated museum areas.</i>

07:17.311 --> 07:21.065
<i>We are open Mondays through Fridays,
9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.</i>

07:21.065 --> 07:23.734
This journal's been scrutinized
by historians.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.821
If there was a clue, wouldn't someone
have noticed it by now?

07:27.238 --> 07:28.656
People don't know to look for it.

07:28.656 --> 07:31.325
To them, it's just a journal about a dog.

07:31.325 --> 07:33.536
Let's get to it
before Billie figures it out.

07:35.037 --> 07:36.247
It should be this way.

07:36.998 --> 07:40.376
Lewis's journal
was usually displayed here, right?

07:40.376 --> 07:41.294
What?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.253
- Liam's here.
- So?

07:42.253 --> 07:44.547
So he can't see me
or he'll know I'm ghosting him.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.007
I'm sorry, but...

07:46.007 --> 07:48.176
Lewis's journal is no longer on display.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.303
To prevent it from deteriorating,

07:50.303 --> 07:52.180
we only bring it up for special events.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.931
Well, is there any way I can see it?

07:54.432 --> 07:56.434
Come to the Governor's Ball tomorrow.

07:56.434 --> 07:57.602
Is that open to the public?

07:57.602 --> 07:59.020
Of course,

07:59.020 --> 08:00.480
at 500 dollars a head.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.191
It's a fundraiser
for the governor's re-election campaign.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.525
Five hundred bucks?

08:04.525 --> 08:06.152
Sounds like the opposite of public.

08:08.613 --> 08:09.655
- Thank you.
- Mm.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.580
Hey, I'm gonna need you
to wire me the money today.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.042
What?

08:25.963 --> 08:27.632
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.009
Liam was at the governor's mansion.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.512
- Did he see you?
- No.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.722
Hmm.

08:34.847 --> 08:35.723
What?

08:36.349 --> 08:37.350
Don't be mad at me.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.519
I sent Liam a fake email

08:39.519 --> 08:41.604
from his bank asking him
to change his password.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.689
- You phished Liam?
- He fell for the oldest trick in the book.

08:43.689 --> 08:44.941
That's not my fault. That's on him!

08:44.941 --> 08:46.859
Anyway, it gave me access,

08:46.859 --> 08:49.111
and come check this out.

08:49.987 --> 08:53.115
Fifty thousand dollars was wired
into his bank account just now.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.952
- Fifty thousand dollars?
- Yes.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.164
Billie was willing to pay you anything
for that box,

09:00.164 --> 09:02.166
I'm guessing she paid Liam off.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.960
Trust no one.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.004
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

09:10.258 --> 09:14.136
I'm about to spend the next six hours
working right next to that weasel.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.349
- What am I supposed to do?
- Well...

09:18.349 --> 09:22.144
What you aren't gonna do is mention
anything about the treasure hunts.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.062
Okay?

09:28.734 --> 09:29.569
Hey.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.280
You... you get my text this morning?

09:32.863 --> 09:34.031
Sorry.

09:34.031 --> 09:36.450
Um, my phone died earlier.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.578
Oh, that's a bummer.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.789
Ended up going to check out that journal.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.709
Couldn't get a look at it,
but it's gonna be on display

09:44.709 --> 09:46.711
at the Governor's Ball tomorrow.

09:47.211 --> 09:48.754
So I got us two tickets.

09:49.755 --> 09:50.798
Two tickets?

09:52.508 --> 09:54.468
Aren't those, like, super expensive?

09:55.344 --> 09:56.387
No, it's...

09:56.887 --> 09:57.763
It's no big.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.056
I was able to swing it.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.684
So can you go?

10:02.810 --> 10:03.894
Um...

10:07.023 --> 10:08.733
Hey, you okay?

10:09.066 --> 10:10.735
I, I thought you'd be pumped.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.446
Hey, what's going on?

10:14.238 --> 10:16.866
If this is about us yesterday,
I, I thought you were into it.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.367
It's not about that.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.079
Then, what is it?

10:22.788 --> 10:24.415
Billie knows about the Elvis clue.

10:25.249 --> 10:26.584
And she knew at the wake.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.004
Wait.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.465
You think that I told her about it?

10:34.216 --> 10:36.469
How could you for a second imagine
that I would betray you like that?

10:36.469 --> 10:37.470
For money?

10:38.721 --> 10:40.890
- Maybe Billie paid you off?
- Seriously?

10:40.890 --> 10:43.059
Then how do you explain the 50 grand

10:43.059 --> 10:44.935
wired into your bank account today?

10:45.603 --> 10:46.771
You looked at my bank account?

10:47.813 --> 10:48.981
I should've seen this coming.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.568
This is what treasure hunting does
to people.

10:54.236 --> 10:57.281
It makes you paranoid
and suspicious of everyone.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.748
<i>Just touched down in Mexico City.</i>

11:05.748 --> 11:07.750
<i>Please tell me my investment
in Jess's life</i>

11:07.750 --> 11:09.043
<i>has coughed up more clues.</i>

11:09.043 --> 11:10.795
Nothing yet. Keeping a lookout.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.429
I mean, I'm partial to roses,

11:20.429 --> 11:23.974
but, uh, I'll settle for... yard waste?

11:23.974 --> 11:26.268
Actually, it's English yew.

11:26.268 --> 11:27.436
And it's toxic.

11:27.436 --> 11:28.562
Sometimes deadly.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.648
Gee, thanks.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.692
I found it in Sadusky's study.

11:33.109 --> 11:36.320
Good work, agent, but English Yew
doesn't usually kill a person

11:36.320 --> 11:38.030
unless they already
have one foot in the grave.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.533
Then, it can cause cardiogenic shock.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.743
Sadusky was 87.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.539
I'll take a look at his stomach contents.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.917
I, I know there's
a lot riding on this for you.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.544
My boss signed off on it, actually.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.587
- That's great! Congrats!
- Thank you.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.382
I Googled you.

11:57.341 --> 11:58.843
You were top of your class at Quantico.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.682
I told my mom
to take that off her Facebook page.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.144
Well, she's obviously really proud of you.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.855
Just makes me wonder
what "top of her class"

12:10.855 --> 12:13.232
is doing
in bottom-of-the-ladder Baton Rouge.

12:16.110 --> 12:20.573
All FBI agents must be willing and able
to serve anywhere in the FBI jurisdiction.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.824
They tell you that day one.

12:26.370 --> 12:30.082
UNIVERSITY OF MEXICO CITY
MEXICO CITY

12:30.082 --> 12:31.083
<i>♪ Y ahora de día ♪</i>

12:31.083 --> 12:33.711
<i>♪ Yo que decía que no bebería ♪</i>

12:33.711 --> 12:35.880
<i>♪ Y sigo aquí contigo todavía ♪</i>

12:48.476 --> 12:50.269
Do I look like a student?

12:50.269 --> 12:51.854
You flatter me, Professor.

12:53.522 --> 12:56.525
I was hoping you could translate
something for me.

12:58.986 --> 13:00.237
Cortés's journal.

13:00.237 --> 13:04.241
Malinche made several entries in it,
in the Nahuatl language.

13:04.241 --> 13:05.659
Amazing.

13:05.659 --> 13:10.372
A girl called me recently asking
about Malinche's lost writing.

13:10.372 --> 13:11.415
She was very insistent.

13:11.415 --> 13:13.542
I told her it didn't exist.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.840
This is one of Malinche's entries.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.842
I need you to translate it.

13:25.387 --> 13:28.307
I guess the governor
is a fan of Ethan's mom's art.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.935
He came through with a free ticket
to the ball.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.395
I thought that's what you wanted.

13:33.395 --> 13:34.688
I did.

13:34.688 --> 13:36.148
But now Liam will be there.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.025
And if he's working with Billie,

13:38.025 --> 13:39.819
they'll probably be there together.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.156
And worse, does it even matter
if we get the journal?

13:44.156 --> 13:46.909
I mean, Liam has the entire Clue Room
plus Billie's resources,

13:46.909 --> 13:48.577
- and we have--
- Stop it.

13:48.577 --> 13:51.705
Friends don't let friends go full spiral.

13:51.705 --> 13:52.998
Listen,

13:52.998 --> 13:55.543
we got pictures of the box.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.338
And your brain and they don't.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.465
A million points for Gryffindor.

14:02.466 --> 14:03.968
What? That was a pep talk.

14:03.968 --> 14:06.846
You should have seen how hurt Liam was
when I confronted him at the club.

14:06.846 --> 14:07.930
Jess, the boy is guilty.

14:07.930 --> 14:11.308
He may not be U-G-L-Y,
but he sure ain't got no alibi.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.019
Hey.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.188
Can I, uh... Can I hang here for a while?

14:16.897 --> 14:18.274
Um, sure.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.151
Are you okay?

14:21.151 --> 14:25.364
Yeah, uh, Ethan and Meena we're having
morning-after breakfast,

14:25.364 --> 14:28.284
and I felt like a third wheel,
so I had to bounce.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.827
What is this?

14:29.827 --> 14:31.370
Oren, please don't touch that.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.414
Whoa!

14:35.791 --> 14:37.126
It's green.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.253
Shh!

14:39.253 --> 14:40.629
- What the...
- Give it.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.131
What the hell...

14:45.301 --> 14:46.886
- Stop squirming!
- No, no!

14:46.886 --> 14:48.470
Those cost half a g!

14:48.470 --> 14:49.930
Jess, you... Just...

14:49.930 --> 14:50.931
Hey!

14:51.599 --> 14:52.516
Shh!

14:53.350 --> 14:54.184
Those are just...

15:00.649 --> 15:02.318
<i>What's up, y'all? It's Oren Bradley here</i>

15:02.318 --> 15:04.987
<i>with yet another sneaker review.
And let me tell you,</i>

15:04.987 --> 15:06.614
-<i>I had not been this excited...</i>
- No.

15:06.614 --> 15:07.948
-<i>...about strap sneakers since my...</i>
- No. Not my Inversions.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.700
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- What are you doing?

15:09.700 --> 15:11.660
-<i>In my 21 years of existence.</i>
- Giving Billie something to listen to.

15:11.660 --> 15:14.038
-<i>Truly you guys are not been...</i>
- Not, my baby.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.289
My baby, my baby.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.875
So Liam's not the mole,
Oren's shoe's the mole.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.711
I look ridiculous.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.421
When was the last time you wore those?

15:22.421 --> 15:23.714
You don't follow my sneaker Insta?

15:23.714 --> 15:25.633
- No.
- Absolutely not.

15:26.383 --> 15:27.217
Okay.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.345
Let's see, shall we?

15:30.095 --> 15:30.930
Oh.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.474
When I came over for trivia night.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.517
And we played you the Elvis clue?

15:39.229 --> 15:40.773
So...

15:41.482 --> 15:43.192
- not Liam.
- Mm.

15:43.692 --> 15:44.652
Oren's shoe.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.445
Whoops.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.405
It's my bad.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.575
No, it's okay.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.869
I was convinced too.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.623
Are you sure this belonged to Cortés?

15:57.623 --> 15:58.666
Oh, yes.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.503
Provenance has been confirmed
and carbon-dated.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.632
Cortés famously wrote five letters

16:06.632 --> 16:10.177
to the Emperor Charles the Fifth,
ruler of Spain,

16:10.177 --> 16:13.931
who was very anxious to hear
about his investments in a New World.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.435
Here is one of them.

16:18.435 --> 16:19.853
This is Cortés's handwriting.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.984
See the little pen stroke flourishes?

16:24.984 --> 16:30.072
Cortés put flourishes everywhere,
except on his capital G.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.583
He sold me a fake.

16:41.583 --> 16:45.087
I doubt whoever sold this to you
knew it was a fake.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.506
I know what you're looking for.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.341
The Pan-American treasure.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.843
What do you know about it?

16:51.552 --> 16:52.803
That it's a myth.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.472
Malinche was a traitor to her people.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.683
She didn't leave behind any treasure maps.

17:05.065 --> 17:05.983
New song?

17:07.735 --> 17:08.902
I'm sorry.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.362
I knocked, but...

17:13.949 --> 17:15.617
I came to apologize.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.495
I know you're not the mole.

17:19.246 --> 17:20.164
Yeah.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.499
Well, I told you it wasn't me.

17:22.499 --> 17:25.335
Look, I don't expect you to forgive me,
but can you at least look at me?

17:27.629 --> 17:28.672
You know...

17:30.340 --> 17:32.301
I'm used to people writing me off.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.807
I guess I just thought you were different?

17:41.268 --> 17:45.147
If anyone should have given you
the benefit of the doubt, it's me.

17:45.731 --> 17:50.069
Because I've never gotten it before, and...

17:50.444 --> 17:52.196
- I know how bad it feels.
- You?

17:54.198 --> 17:55.699
How's that even possible?

17:57.785 --> 17:59.453
It's just how it is.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.415
The minute someone's milk money
went missing at school,

18:03.415 --> 18:05.459
whose backpack do you think
they checked first?

18:06.460 --> 18:10.422
The scholarship kid with the last name
no one could pronounce.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.011
I can't even imagine what that feels like.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.222
- I'm so sorry.
- What?

18:18.222 --> 18:22.059
No, I wasn't trying to make you apologize.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.186
I was trying to apologize.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.395
You were right.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.605
I'm sorry.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.150
Hunting for treasure made me paranoid.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.819
The pressure got to me.

18:32.986 --> 18:34.321
Can you forgive me?

18:46.625 --> 18:49.002
Out of curiosity, what was that 50k for?

18:51.547 --> 18:53.924
That was dumb. I'm sorry.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.384
No, I, I can tell you.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.553
No, it's none of my business.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.180
Let's get back to kissing.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.266
No, you wanna know so bad?

19:02.266 --> 19:04.017
I never wanted to know anything less.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.647
Fine, fine. Then I won't tell you
that my mom lent me the money

19:08.647 --> 19:10.983
to help pay the property taxes
on this stupid house

19:10.983 --> 19:11.984
that I don't even want.

19:13.026 --> 19:14.069
Wow.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.947
That's so boring.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.366
We can't go back to kissing after that.

19:19.366 --> 19:22.202
Oh, come on, I was saving
my exciting stories for the ball.

19:24.663 --> 19:25.998
We're still going, right?

19:27.541 --> 19:28.709
Any chance you own a tux?

19:28.709 --> 19:30.377
No.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.004
Never even worn one.

19:34.548 --> 19:35.966
But I think I know someone who did.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.720
<i>♪ Hoy que ya no estás ♪</i>

19:39.720 --> 19:41.972
<i>♪ Pude descrifrar ♪</i>

19:41.972 --> 19:44.474
<i>♪ Tú eras la mentira ♪</i>

19:45.309 --> 19:46.435
Wow!

19:46.435 --> 19:47.561
<i>Miralo!</i>

19:47.561 --> 19:49.938
Your, your grandpa was full of surprises.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.148
His tux looks good on you.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.817
- Except it's, uh, it's a little big.
- Don't worry.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.819
I know the best tailor in town.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.948
We'll find Malinche's Codex.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.533
I have two other dealers
that I can hit up.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.744
There is no codex.

20:05.787 --> 20:06.788
Missed something.

20:07.414 --> 20:11.752
They found the bug and they put us
in a loop of Oren's sneaker channel.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.337
- Hmm?
- Listen to this.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.672
<i>This is the best thing
Michael Jordan has done</i>

20:15.672 --> 20:17.591
<i>since</i> Space Jam. <i>Like...</i>

20:20.344 --> 20:24.097
<i>This is the best thing Michael Jordan
has done since</i> Space Jam.

20:24.097 --> 20:26.058
<i>Like, look at this shoe...</i>

20:27.392 --> 20:28.393
See.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.728
Interesting.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.190
That means they're having conversations
they don't want us to hear.

20:33.190 --> 20:36.443
Surveillance just caught Liam and Jess
leaving Sadusky's house...

20:37.110 --> 20:38.278
with a tuxedo.

20:38.278 --> 20:39.947
Find out where they're going.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.496
Wait, wait, wait.

20:48.038 --> 20:48.956
Zoom in.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.707
Zoom in on her necklace.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.755
The medallion.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.966
It was worn by the women
who hid the treasure.

20:59.549 --> 21:03.720
The Daughters
of the Plumed Serpent Medallion.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.978
Can't be. They're dead.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.854
- Who's dead?
- Rafael Rios,

21:13.647 --> 21:15.524
his wife, and his baby.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.944
- Rafael Rios, the treasure hunter?
- Yes.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.363
He was killed,
and his wife and his daughter

21:21.363 --> 21:24.074
died trying to cross the border
20 years ago.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.200
At least, everyone thought they did.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.994
You think Rafael Rios is Jess's dad?

21:26.994 --> 21:29.037
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

21:29.037 --> 21:32.708
Rafael had one
of the only surviving medallions

21:32.708 --> 21:34.584
of the Daughters of the Plumed Serpent.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.878
Guess we know why Sadusky gave her
that clue.

21:37.462 --> 21:40.549
This changes everything.

21:41.300 --> 21:45.387
Okay, so the only black-tie event
that I can find is the Governor's Ball.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.014
Doesn't seem like their kind of party.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.432
Of course.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.685
Lewis and Clark.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.520
The clue.

21:53.520 --> 21:57.482
Meriwether Lewis was governor
of Louisiana.

21:58.066 --> 21:59.818
Right after the famous expedition,

21:59.818 --> 22:05.198
Lewis was on his way to deliver a journal
to the president in Washington, DC.

22:05.532 --> 22:10.537
He checked into an inn
where he was found, later dead.

22:10.537 --> 22:15.125
Shot twice, once in the stomach,
once in the head.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.252
His death was ruled a suicide

22:17.252 --> 22:19.838
but... it was a cover-up,

22:19.838 --> 22:22.716
an obvious cover-up to steal the journal.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.427
One of 19 surviving journals
from the expedition

22:25.427 --> 22:26.887
is at the governor's mansion

22:26.887 --> 22:30.390
and it was written by Meriwether Lewis
about his dog.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.517
Guess what the breed of dog is?

22:33.352 --> 22:34.311
What?

22:34.895 --> 22:36.438
Newfoundland.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.985
Lewis was murdered for the wrong journal.

22:41.985 --> 22:44.821
Jess is going to that ball to take a look
at that journal.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.698
Clever girl.

22:47.574 --> 22:49.034
Just like her father.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.078
Looks like we're going
to that ball.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.622
<i>♪ I'm tryin' ♪</i>

22:53.622 --> 22:56.833
<i>♪ 'Cause you're everything
I've spent my whole life fightin' ♪</i>

22:57.417 --> 22:59.086
<i>♪ So when I walk away... ♪</i>

22:59.086 --> 23:00.295
Perfect.

23:01.254 --> 23:03.090
I don't think I can do this.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.758
It's not really my scene. You know?

23:04.758 --> 23:08.428
You wanna see that journal,
you got to do it in a tux.

23:08.428 --> 23:10.263
That's what black-tie means.

23:10.263 --> 23:11.681
It's the only way in.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.141
You ready?

23:14.393 --> 23:19.356
Welcome to Oren Bradley's Cruelty-Free
Spring Fashion Show.

23:19.356 --> 23:22.901
<i>♪ I always let the good ones go ♪</i>

23:22.901 --> 23:24.986
Imagine it...

23:24.986 --> 23:26.113
with a shirt on.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.492
Or not.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.205
What's going on here?

23:36.164 --> 23:39.668
Jess and Liam are going
to the Governor's Ball.

23:40.544 --> 23:41.753
Wait, so who's--

23:41.753 --> 23:43.130
It was Oren's shoe.

23:46.299 --> 23:47.467
I don't understand.

23:47.467 --> 23:49.010
Oh, it's a long story,

23:49.010 --> 23:50.512
but it's all good.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.639
And now Liam and I
are going to the ball together.

23:52.639 --> 23:55.392
Okay, but my mom only got you one ticket.

23:55.392 --> 23:58.603
Right, but Liam bought two,

23:58.603 --> 24:01.022
so now we have an extra.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.900
Oh, I have an idea.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.361
I'll buy a ticket,
and then you and I can go too.

24:06.987 --> 24:10.073
Double date at the biggest bash
in Baton Rouge.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.286
Yeah, fun.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.081
Agent Ross!

24:18.081 --> 24:19.541
Dr. Zeke!

24:19.541 --> 24:20.792
Hi, what are you doing here?

24:20.792 --> 24:22.711
I came to see you.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.672
Turns out your suspicions were right.
The English yew killed him.

24:25.672 --> 24:26.715
Really?

24:26.715 --> 24:28.383
Well, I mean, if you believe in science.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.759
Not everybody does these days.

24:29.759 --> 24:31.470
Definitely a believer.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.679
Thank you for this.

24:32.679 --> 24:33.930
No problem.

24:35.223 --> 24:37.726
So, uh, you, you got any suspects yet?

24:39.478 --> 24:43.190
Uh, the grandson, initially,
because he inherited Sandusky's house

24:43.190 --> 24:44.399
but...

24:44.399 --> 24:46.193
...he's this loner musician type.

24:46.193 --> 24:49.404
I just don't think he killed his grandpa
to fast-track to homeownership, you know?

24:49.404 --> 24:50.322
Yeah.

24:50.322 --> 24:53.116
The, uh, loner musician gathers no moss

24:53.116 --> 24:54.326
because he doesn't...

24:54.326 --> 24:55.869
doesn't put down roots.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.287
Right.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.206
And then there's
the grandson's girlfriend,

24:59.206 --> 25:00.582
who was the last person to see him alive.

25:00.582 --> 25:04.419
Well, you know, uh, the last person to see
a victim alive is always a prime suspect.

25:04.419 --> 25:05.420
Exactly.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.965
Except she admitted that to me
when she came in to report a kidnapping.

25:08.965 --> 25:11.801
Why would a murderer do that,
or come into the FBI at all?

25:11.801 --> 25:14.763
- Kidnapped? Who, who was kidnapped?
- I don't know. She wouldn't tell me.

25:14.763 --> 25:17.641
It was this crazy story.
I thought it was a joke, but then...

25:22.270 --> 25:24.481
Oh, man. I got to go, but I owe you one.

25:24.481 --> 25:26.733
Yeah. Uh, coffee sometime?

25:26.733 --> 25:28.527
I like anything
with the word "Nitro" in it.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.486
You got it.

25:32.113 --> 25:34.824
This is Agent Ross
from the FBI field office.

25:34.824 --> 25:37.536
I need to request some security footage.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.413
So you got a plan figured out?

25:40.413 --> 25:43.667
We're just gonna go in, open the journal,
and take some pictures.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.210
Isn't it under lock and key?

25:45.210 --> 25:46.503
Well, it's a digital lock

25:46.503 --> 25:50.382
that I was hoping you could find
the factory reset on?

25:51.925 --> 25:53.885
If you know the make and model.

25:55.095 --> 25:56.888
What about security cameras?

25:58.265 --> 26:00.016
- It's the Governor's Mansion.
- Oh.

26:00.016 --> 26:01.476
He values his privacy.

26:01.476 --> 26:03.019
Hey!

26:03.603 --> 26:05.146
Oh, why is he always here?

26:05.146 --> 26:06.314
It's like he never left.

26:06.314 --> 26:07.941
Just here to pick up my baby!

26:07.941 --> 26:09.359
Hey!

26:09.359 --> 26:10.569
Hey.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.905
- There he is.
- Here you go.

26:13.905 --> 26:14.823
Bug-free.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.575
Oh, my god. You cut up the sole.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.577
Oren, that's where
they hid the bug.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.870
I was gonna wear these tonight
to the ball.

26:20.870 --> 26:22.163
What?

26:22.163 --> 26:23.290
Since when are you going?

26:23.290 --> 26:25.584
Since I begged Ethan to get me in?

26:25.584 --> 26:27.711
And that place is gonna be crawling
with big shots.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.671
That's when I can pitch
my sneaker business

26:29.671 --> 26:31.881
to people with money.

26:31.881 --> 26:33.383
So he got us a table.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.718
We're all going.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.970
Even you, Tash.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.221
I'm gonna go get ready.

26:38.638 --> 26:41.099
And I gotta do my hair.

26:41.474 --> 26:43.935
Tasha, I need to prove my mom was right.

26:45.186 --> 26:46.896
I just can't risk anything going wrong

26:46.896 --> 26:50.984
and that party is gonna be crawling
with politicians.

26:50.984 --> 26:53.445
I, Tasha Rivers,

26:53.445 --> 26:56.906
can completely handle myself
at a political fundraiser.

26:58.199 --> 26:59.159
I promise.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.077
And what if Billie shows up?

27:01.494 --> 27:02.829
You're gonna need me.

27:04.247 --> 27:06.666
Well then, I guess we're both gonna have
to find something to wear.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.001
Let's do it.

27:08.001 --> 27:10.503
<i>♪ I'm in the stars tonight ♪</i>

27:10.503 --> 27:14.466
<i>♪ So watch me bring the fire
and set the night alight ♪</i>

27:15.091 --> 27:16.551
Ba ba boom.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.723
It's like prom all over again.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.683
Please don't mention prom.

27:23.683 --> 27:26.227
Okay, but we are in our prom dresses.

27:26.227 --> 27:28.605
These are vintage.
They're never going out of style.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.232
Here.

27:31.232 --> 27:32.901
Make sure you pump the brakes twice.

27:32.901 --> 27:33.902
All right?

27:35.195 --> 27:36.905
Check it.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.323
Full slayer mode.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.244
You look amazing.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.252
Excuse me.

27:51.252 --> 27:53.797
Gentlemen are required to wear a tie.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.006
What happened to the tie I gave you?

27:55.006 --> 27:55.965
The clip broke.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.426
What if I just button my collar?

27:58.426 --> 28:00.220
This is the Governor's Ball.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.430
You're already pushing it
with the blue tux.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.016
That's okay.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.351
I have an idea.

28:11.272 --> 28:12.565
Fashion triage.

28:12.565 --> 28:14.359
Come on, MacGyver.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.819
MacGirl.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.529
I gotta pitch that.

28:18.071 --> 28:19.989
Am I making you nervous, Valenzuela?

28:19.989 --> 28:21.449
Shut up.

28:21.449 --> 28:23.535
Hm?

28:24.619 --> 28:26.037
There.

28:26.037 --> 28:27.497
Perfect.

28:38.341 --> 28:39.342
- Hey.
- Oh.

28:39.342 --> 28:41.428
- So you guys are already here.
- Retro dresses.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.763
You two just crushed every ball gown here.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.348
Ethan, I must say,

28:45.348 --> 28:47.142
your girlfriend has incredible taste.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.310
I like to think
I'm the one with good taste.

28:51.771 --> 28:53.356
- Let's do this.
- Yeah.

28:53.356 --> 28:55.442
The faces are here, y'all.

28:56.192 --> 28:57.360
What's this?

28:57.360 --> 29:00.321
Just a list of things you can't say
or do tonight.

29:00.321 --> 29:01.656
What?

29:01.656 --> 29:05.076
I expressly came here to, uh, say and do
all these things.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.036
Where are your mom's sculptures?

29:07.036 --> 29:08.955
Upstairs. Come on, I'll show you.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.127
Whoa.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.421
These people are blinged-out.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.631
Everyone here is straight-up loaded.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.384
Did you see that guy who just went by?

29:21.384 --> 29:22.677
- You mean Senator Waller?
- Yeah.

29:22.677 --> 29:23.970
More like Senator Baller.

29:23.970 --> 29:27.098
Dude was wearing a 40,000-dollar Rolex.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.475
40k for a watch?

29:31.853 --> 29:35.231
I mean, uh, I am sure

29:35.231 --> 29:37.901
there is a perfectly legal and ethical,

29:37.901 --> 29:40.570
even, story on how he acquired said watch.

29:41.321 --> 29:44.908
So I heard from the band that this ball
is actually a surprise birthday party

29:44.908 --> 29:45.992
for the governor.

29:45.992 --> 29:50.038
Okay? They're bringing out cake,
champagne, the works, at 6:15.

29:50.038 --> 29:52.707
So we have less than an hour
until all eyes,

29:52.707 --> 29:54.918
including security,
will be on the governor.

29:56.127 --> 29:59.005
Yeah. A perfect time
to get a private look at that journal.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.218
Okay, let's move.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.469
Okay, um...

30:05.386 --> 30:07.305
So I know you said the journal
would be on display

30:07.305 --> 30:08.681
but how about we make sure it's there?

30:08.681 --> 30:10.391
You're a double-checker, I get it.

30:10.391 --> 30:11.976
I am, and it's a lifestyle.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.603
So you might wanna unfollow right now.

30:13.603 --> 30:16.022
Can't, I already liked and subscribed.
And who knows?

30:16.022 --> 30:18.316
Maybe we'll get to look at it quick
and get out of there.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.401
Yeah. I'm already sick of you.

30:27.575 --> 30:28.535
Whoa.

30:28.535 --> 30:30.078
There is Meriwether's journal.

30:30.078 --> 30:32.664
Didn't expect all these people
to be in here. It's like a...

30:32.664 --> 30:34.582
private nerd party.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.709
Yeah, who looks at books at a party?

30:36.709 --> 30:38.127
I mean, besides us.

30:38.753 --> 30:40.088
That's okay.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.590
The room will clear out the minute
they start singing "Happy Birthday".

30:42.590 --> 30:45.552
Except for the guards
I'm sure they'll keep making the rounds.

30:45.552 --> 30:48.888
I'll keep a lookout
while you take pictures of the pages.

30:48.888 --> 30:51.099
Yeah, it should only take five minutes
at the most.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.017
And you're sure you know
how to factory reset the lock?

30:53.017 --> 30:54.727
Tasha showed me how to do it three times.

30:54.727 --> 30:57.105
I had it on at first,
but she's very thorough.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.064
Good.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.274
Then we're in and out.

30:59.274 --> 31:00.650
Solve the clue later.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.861
Yeah. Crab claws for everyone.

31:05.488 --> 31:07.073
Deconstructed gumbo?

31:07.615 --> 31:08.658
Uh-uh.

31:08.658 --> 31:10.743
That right there is colonialism
on a plate.

31:10.743 --> 31:12.287
Okay, have a crab leg.

31:12.287 --> 31:14.038
That's still being complicit, Oren.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.999
Think about it like this, okay?

31:15.999 --> 31:18.501
We're here for free.

31:18.501 --> 31:19.586
Mm.

31:19.586 --> 31:21.045
Everyone else

31:21.045 --> 31:23.673
paid to come kiss the governor's butt.

31:23.673 --> 31:25.675
So, essentially,

31:26.259 --> 31:28.094
we're sticking it to the man

31:28.094 --> 31:30.263
with every crab leg we eat.

31:30.263 --> 31:31.347
I'm right?

31:31.347 --> 31:32.390
Okay.

31:32.390 --> 31:33.433
Yeah.

31:37.186 --> 31:38.313
Hey.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.440
I heard you and Ethan are official now.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.733
Very cool.

31:41.733 --> 31:42.734
Thanks.

31:43.818 --> 31:45.403
I really like him.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.823
And I know he really likes you.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.034
I mean, he went golfing with you.

31:51.534 --> 31:52.535
What?

31:53.077 --> 31:54.871
Ethan doesn't like golf?

31:56.706 --> 31:58.207
Well, yeah...

31:58.750 --> 32:01.294
No, except miniature golf.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.297
Oh, he never told me that.

32:06.049 --> 32:08.384
Does he think he can't be himself with me?

32:08.384 --> 32:09.594
No.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.512
He's trying to impress you.

32:11.512 --> 32:14.515
Trust me, he's refused to play golf
with plenty of girls.

32:18.478 --> 32:19.395
Keith, let me tell you.

32:19.395 --> 32:21.356
Small-batch manufacturing

32:21.356 --> 32:23.066
is the way of the future, right?

32:23.066 --> 32:26.861
Buyers are craving innovative ideas
from independent artists

32:26.861 --> 32:29.447
that can be replicated and promoted

32:29.447 --> 32:32.033
in a marketplace demanding freshness.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.701
Keith if I'm being honest,

32:34.285 --> 32:36.454
all me and my sneaker designs need

32:36.913 --> 32:39.040
is that one manufacturing partner.

32:39.040 --> 32:43.002
Someone who aligns
with my high expectations.

32:43.711 --> 32:44.837
So what do you say?

32:50.927 --> 32:52.470
Email me the business proposal.

32:54.347 --> 32:55.264
Thank you.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.143
Yeah, okay.

32:59.727 --> 33:03.022
I just talked to the richest guy
in the room.

33:03.022 --> 33:05.733
- Hm.
- Keith Heisler.

33:05.733 --> 33:06.693
Oh, my god.

33:06.693 --> 33:09.153
I need to take a selfie
to immortalize this moment.

33:09.153 --> 33:10.905
Absolutely not. No.

33:11.322 --> 33:12.657
We don't need any evidence
that we were here.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.200
It's bad enough my DNA's on this fork.

33:14.200 --> 33:17.328
Hey, "no selfies" is third
on the list I gave you.

33:18.663 --> 33:19.580
See?

33:20.832 --> 33:22.375
Oh, my god!

33:22.375 --> 33:24.836
You guys!

33:24.836 --> 33:25.962
- Absolutely not.
- No.

33:25.962 --> 33:27.005
No, you have to.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.257
What are the odds
that they would play this song?

33:29.257 --> 33:30.258
It's obviously a sign.

33:30.258 --> 33:31.426
Yeah, a sign you've lost your mind.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.553
So, this is the song
Jess and Ethan danced to

33:33.553 --> 33:34.804
at their middle school cotillion.

33:34.804 --> 33:37.181
And they crushed the competition.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.766
Aww, I did cotillion too.

33:38.766 --> 33:40.018
What's cotillion?

33:40.018 --> 33:42.228
Exactly. Nobody cares.

33:42.228 --> 33:45.273
But they also reprised it at prom
when the song randomly came on,

33:45.273 --> 33:46.607
and people freaked out.

33:46.607 --> 33:48.067
Oh, well, now I gotta see it.

33:48.067 --> 33:50.403
Come on, give us a little reunion tour.

33:50.403 --> 33:52.238
The cake's coming out in...

33:52.238 --> 33:53.781
less than ten minutes.

33:53.781 --> 33:56.034
Uh, so, songs are, like, two.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.744
Come on, show us what you got.

34:01.956 --> 34:04.375
Yes!

34:04.375 --> 34:05.585
Come on!

34:05.585 --> 34:07.045
This is gonna be great.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.130
Watch this.
They always clear the dance floor.

they did this at prom?

35:34.841 --> 35:37.176
Hey, don't they say

36:12.420 --> 36:14.130
- Where's Meena?
- They were...

36:14.130 --> 36:15.798
They were just here. So weird.

36:17.341 --> 36:18.342
Meena, wait!

36:19.302 --> 36:21.012
We shouldn't have danced that dance.

36:21.762 --> 36:23.222
The cake is coming out any second.

36:23.222 --> 36:24.557
I need to find Liam.

36:25.808 --> 36:26.767
Oh.

36:35.276 --> 36:36.611
Come on, bubble.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.910
<i>Hey, it's Liam. Leave a message.</i>

36:43.910 --> 36:46.078
Okay, you're ghosting me. I get it.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.789
But that dance
wasn't what you think it was.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.502
Hey, you okay?

36:56.255 --> 36:57.673
That was, um...

36:57.673 --> 36:59.383
That was quite a dance.

37:00.927 --> 37:03.262
It's just a silly routine
we learned in middle school.

37:04.555 --> 37:07.225
There's nothing silly about the way
you were looking at her.

37:07.808 --> 37:09.560
Meena, it's...

37:10.269 --> 37:13.064
We're just friends, okay?

37:13.439 --> 37:14.899
- I swear.
- Yeah.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.360
You might be just friends,

37:17.360 --> 37:19.654
but I'm pretty sure you wish it were more.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.031
It's not like that. I truly like you.

37:22.031 --> 37:24.200
And I truly wanna believe you.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.119
But you need to be sure about
who you really wanna be with.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.502
Anyways, I know I'm rambling

37:35.419 --> 37:37.797
but can we please just finish
what we started?

37:38.422 --> 37:39.465
Find me.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.974

37:51.727 --> 37:52.645
Liam!

37:58.859 --> 38:00.486
Hey, you! Freeze!

38:00.486 --> 38:01.570
You stole the journal.

38:03.906 --> 38:06.075
In progress burglary.
Female suspect exiting the library.

38:06.075 --> 38:07.201
Brunette, purple dress.

38:10.746 --> 38:12.581
Why is she not texting back?

38:12.999 --> 38:14.458
Have you tried tracking her?

38:15.126 --> 38:17.253
Oren, how did I not think of that?

38:17.253 --> 38:18.337
Yes.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.966
Okay. So she's still somewhere
inside the mansion.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.009
That's good.

38:53.122 --> 38:55.041
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

38:55.041 --> 38:56.375
Cheers!

38:56.375 --> 38:57.710
- Cheers.
- Uh...

38:57.710 --> 39:01.047
Shame on all of y'all fat wallets!

39:01.047 --> 39:04.633
Wining and dining
while our public schools crumble,

39:04.633 --> 39:09.430
while our aging senior population
experiences food insecurity.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.849
Shame on everybody here.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.809
Hey-hey, ho-ho!

39:13.809 --> 39:15.686
Politicians gotta go.

39:15.686 --> 39:17.480
- Hey-hey, ho-ho! Yeah!
- Hey-hey, ho-ho!

39:17.480 --> 39:19.690
- Small business' taxes gotta go!
- Has gotta go!

39:19.690 --> 39:21.067
What the hell are you doing?

39:21.442 --> 39:22.610
I got your back.
I'm fighting for the people.

39:22.610 --> 39:23.819
Oren, that's the opposite
of what you're doing.

39:23.819 --> 39:25.571
Hey-hey, ho-ho!

39:25.571 --> 39:28.407
Grab these, grab these.
Politicians gotta go!

39:28.407 --> 39:30.409
- Hey-hey, ho-ho!
- Hey, you!

39:30.409 --> 39:32.536
The people's blood is on your hands!

39:32.536 --> 39:34.789
- What she said!
- It's on your hands!

39:34.789 --> 39:36.665
Y'all need to leave.

39:36.665 --> 39:38.000
So...

39:38.000 --> 39:39.293
what's it gonna be?

39:42.046 --> 39:43.506
Youth activism.

39:43.506 --> 39:45.174
We love to see it.

39:45.174 --> 39:47.259
Thank you for bringing
these matters up to my attention.

39:47.259 --> 39:50.096
I promise I'll work hard
to earn your vote.

39:51.555 --> 39:53.015
Just to win.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.048
Get in.
