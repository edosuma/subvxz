00:22.001 --> 00:24.686
Wow, I thought last year's
art crawl was terrible,

00:24.754 --> 00:26.938
but they really outdid
themselves this year, huh?

00:27.006 --> 00:28.473
Yeah.
Ugh, bad.

00:28.541 --> 00:30.175
Very bad.
Mm-hmm.

00:30.243 --> 00:32.377
Oh, look at that.
Really bad.

00:32.445 --> 00:34.012
Really, really bad.
Ugh!

00:34.080 --> 00:35.513
Ugh!
I think they're... good.

00:35.565 --> 00:38.233
Dad, why does art crawl
suck so much?

00:38.317 --> 00:40.986
Well, it's just a very
loose definition of art, Louise.

00:41.037 --> 00:42.537
And don't say suck.

00:42.622 --> 00:44.656
Don't say suck, please.

00:44.724 --> 00:46.374
You're right, though.
It does suck.

00:46.459 --> 00:48.459
I don't want you kids
to think this is what art is.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.662
We should go to a museum.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:50.730 --> 00:52.608
Whoa. Yeah, maybe not. Yeah, we should...
We should not go to a museum.

00:52.632 --> 00:54.382
Let's not overdo it.
Let's just walk around

00:54.467 --> 00:56.585
and make fun of this stuff.
Yeah. Okay.

00:56.652 --> 00:59.521
Why don't we just go back
to the restaurant?

00:59.589 --> 01:01.806
Because your aunt Gayle is there
hanging up her art,

01:01.874 --> 01:04.208
which we're not allowed
to make fun of at all.

01:04.260 --> 01:06.645
Well, why can't we make fun
of aunt Gayle's paintings?

01:06.712 --> 01:08.647
She's family.
Yeah.

01:08.714 --> 01:11.016
That means never holding back
anything, right, pit stains?

01:11.067 --> 01:12.817
Am I showing?

01:12.885 --> 01:15.554
Let's just say your shirt looks
like my underwear right now.

01:15.621 --> 01:18.356
Yeah. Well, look, no one tells
Gayle anything she can't handle.

01:18.407 --> 01:20.525
That's your mom's rule,
all right?

01:20.593 --> 01:21.993
You treat her
like a mental patient.

01:22.017 --> 01:24.246
Well, I mean, she probably
should be one, right?

01:24.330 --> 01:26.431
Yeah, I heard she
ate her lipstick once

01:26.499 --> 01:28.066
because she wanted
to feel red inside.

01:28.117 --> 01:31.453
And she made a dress out of
live shrimp and wore it to mass.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.954
Oh, and she shaved her cat.

01:33.022 --> 01:34.389
Come on, Louise.

01:34.457 --> 01:35.690
You know none of that is true.

01:35.758 --> 01:37.475
Except for the cat shaving.

01:37.543 --> 01:39.578
And maybe the shrimp
and the lipstick.

01:39.645 --> 01:42.047
Are you kidding me?
My kid could paint that.

01:42.114 --> 01:44.149
Wow. It costs $200.

01:44.216 --> 01:45.817
Someone bought that mess?!

01:45.885 --> 01:47.335
How rude!

01:47.403 --> 01:48.837
Harold!

01:48.904 --> 01:50.605
Harold?!
What?

01:50.690 --> 01:52.971
There are some poorly supervised
children amongst the art.

01:52.995 --> 01:54.092
Get rid of them!
All right.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.660
Let's go.
Keep moving.

01:55.728 --> 01:57.408
Excuse me. Are you a...?
Are you a bouncer?

01:57.432 --> 01:59.364
Are you gonna bounce my kids?

01:59.432 --> 02:01.266
No, no. Just
keep it moving, chubs.

02:01.334 --> 02:04.269
Chubs? You don't have to go
home, but you can't stay here.

02:04.337 --> 02:06.638
Hey, easy, pal, all right?
Don't touch.

02:06.706 --> 02:08.840
Come on, dad.
This guy's not worth it.

02:08.907 --> 02:11.610
Ah, listen to your kids, fatsy.
Fatsy?

02:11.677 --> 02:12.944
Come on. Come on, dad.
Louise...

02:13.012 --> 02:14.532
Dad, look me...
Give me your eyes, dad.

02:14.556 --> 02:15.947
Give me your eyes.
Mm-hmm.

02:16.015 --> 02:17.716
Take a deep breath.
You are lucky, pal.

02:17.783 --> 02:19.618
It's not worth it, dad.

02:19.685 --> 02:22.604
If you hit him, your hand would
smell like ointment and pee.

02:22.672 --> 02:24.022
You smell like ointment and pee.

02:24.090 --> 02:25.423
You smell like ointment and pee.

02:25.491 --> 02:27.759
You smell like ointment and pee.

02:27.827 --> 02:30.128
You smell like ointment and pee.
You...

02:32.698 --> 02:33.999
Well, that was awkward.

02:34.066 --> 02:35.600
What is that place?

02:35.668 --> 02:36.748
You don't know reflections?

02:36.786 --> 02:38.253
They sell art,

02:38.321 --> 02:39.988
not just during art
crawl, but year-round.

02:40.056 --> 02:41.690
Reflections.

02:41.757 --> 02:44.092
It sounds like a strip club,
the way you say it.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.827
Reflections.
Mmm.

02:45.895 --> 02:48.463
So, brace yourselves
for aunt Gayle's art show.

02:48.531 --> 02:51.399
Mom said aunt Gayle told her
they're just adorable animals.

02:51.467 --> 02:53.651
Oh, yeah? Well,
that doesn't sound so bad.

02:53.703 --> 02:56.071
Hi, hon!
How was art crawl? Hey.

02:56.138 --> 02:58.573
Huh? Everything's going
great here. We're having fun.

02:58.641 --> 02:59.741
Oh, wow.

02:59.809 --> 03:00.992
Lin...
Gayle's here!

03:01.060 --> 03:02.310
We hung-hung her paintings!

03:02.378 --> 03:04.429
Look at this one!
Look at that one!

03:04.496 --> 03:07.515
Linda, can you just
let me see...? Oh, my God!

03:09.051 --> 03:10.919
Yeah! Anuses!

03:14.768 --> 03:17.269
Oh, God. Oh, my God, Lin.
It's a few days, Bobby.

03:17.337 --> 03:19.688
Linda, there are animal anuses
all over our walls.

03:19.773 --> 03:21.674
Just think of 'em as
cute little rumps.

03:21.741 --> 03:23.175
Lin, they're anuses.

03:23.243 --> 03:24.843
I'm trying to think
of worse paintings

03:24.911 --> 03:26.278
to hang in a restaurant.

03:26.346 --> 03:28.530
Um... nope, I can't
think of any.

03:28.615 --> 03:30.716
Bad monkey!
Kids, stop that.

03:30.784 --> 03:31.884
No. I'm spanking
the monkey!

03:31.951 --> 03:33.652
No way, dad.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.138
This is the best thing
that has ever happened to us.

03:36.206 --> 03:37.506
Horse butt.

03:37.574 --> 03:39.007
Oh, hello, sir.

03:39.075 --> 03:40.676
Don't look at the pictures
of the anus...

03:40.744 --> 03:42.578
Yup, he already did. Okay.
You see that, Lin?

03:42.645 --> 03:44.913
No one wants to eat with one
of those staring at them.

03:44.981 --> 03:47.341
Come on, you can't seriously
think that this is a good idea.

03:47.365 --> 03:49.518
Well, they're not for me,
but we promised Gayle

03:49.586 --> 03:51.653
she could display her art
for the art crawl.

03:51.721 --> 03:53.122
We can't take it back now.

03:53.189 --> 03:55.157
She's fragile.
We have to support her.

03:55.225 --> 03:56.892
She's not that fragile, Lin.

03:59.295 --> 04:00.596
What happened?
What happened?

04:00.663 --> 04:03.031
Gayle, Gayle honey, look,
look, it's a fork.

04:03.099 --> 04:04.933
What?
Look, it's a fork.

04:05.001 --> 04:06.435
Oh, it's a fork. Ha.

04:06.503 --> 04:07.970
Oh, you're killing me.

04:08.037 --> 04:09.405
She's killing me.

04:09.472 --> 04:10.939
Okay, so she's fragile.

04:11.007 --> 04:13.292
And that means we have
to be the anus restaurant?

04:13.359 --> 04:14.910
Yes, it means that.

04:14.978 --> 04:16.728
Oh, we can make t-shirts!
It'll say:

04:16.796 --> 04:18.313
"Milk, milk, lemonade.

04:18.380 --> 04:20.699
Around the corner art is made."

04:20.767 --> 04:22.718
Bob! Do you
love 'em?

04:22.786 --> 04:24.586
Or do you just love 'em?

04:24.654 --> 04:26.355
Um, how did you...?

04:26.423 --> 04:29.875
Why... why would you
paint... this?

04:29.943 --> 04:33.662
The inspiration came to me
on a mountaintop.

04:33.730 --> 04:36.432
What should I paint?

04:48.962 --> 04:51.780
Huh.
He loves 'em!

04:54.400 --> 04:56.568
All right, listen up.

04:56.619 --> 04:59.872
All the suckers come out
for art crawl.

04:59.939 --> 05:01.907
And they all want
to pay money for crap.

05:01.975 --> 05:03.809
So paint some crap,
and we can sell it.

05:03.877 --> 05:05.144
Wait. You're not painting?

05:05.211 --> 05:06.612
No, I'm management.

05:06.679 --> 05:08.564
You two paint the stuff,
I'll do the rest.

05:08.631 --> 05:09.965
I'll be wheeling and dealing.

05:10.033 --> 05:11.400
I'll be getting my percent.

05:13.169 --> 05:15.087
Okay, let's see
what you got so far.

05:15.138 --> 05:16.688
Time's up.
Paint brushes down.

05:16.756 --> 05:18.457
What the hell is this?

05:18.525 --> 05:21.827
I told you to paint
commercial touristy crap.

05:21.895 --> 05:23.462
I'm sorry I'm not a sellout.

05:23.530 --> 05:25.230
I can only paint what I feel.

05:25.298 --> 05:26.899
And I can only paint the truth!

05:26.966 --> 05:28.400
The robots are coming!

05:30.136 --> 05:31.487
Hide!

05:31.554 --> 05:33.021
Ah, this is great.

05:33.106 --> 05:34.973
You guys want
to be real artists, huh?

05:35.024 --> 05:37.659
Okay, that's an angle.
I can sell that.

05:37.727 --> 05:40.779
But if you're going artsy,
then you're going all the way.

05:40.847 --> 05:43.648
Someone's cutting off an ear.

05:43.700 --> 05:45.551
I need both of mine.
I wear glasses.

05:45.618 --> 05:46.952
Welp, what's your excuse?

05:47.020 --> 05:48.687
Don't got one.
Have at it.

05:48.755 --> 05:50.856
Teddy, what's wrong? You
haven't touched your food.

05:50.924 --> 05:52.758
I don't, Bob.
It's just the, uh...

05:52.826 --> 05:54.276
The anuses? Yeah.
Yeah, you know.

05:54.344 --> 05:55.811
Yeah, they're, uh...
I know.

05:55.879 --> 05:57.412
Oh, they're like
Mona Lisa's eyes.

05:57.480 --> 05:58.797
They follow you wherever you go.

05:58.865 --> 06:00.199
Ooh, you're right.

06:00.266 --> 06:01.717
Well, I like 'em!

06:01.801 --> 06:03.368
You like 'em?
Ugh.

06:03.436 --> 06:04.820
Yeah. What's the problem?

06:04.888 --> 06:06.839
The anus is the window
of the butt.

06:06.906 --> 06:08.386
It's true. I guess
she's just painting

06:08.410 --> 06:09.507
what we're all thinking.

06:09.559 --> 06:11.093
Well, okay, but, Mort,

06:11.160 --> 06:12.880
would you hang them up
in your funeral home?

06:12.947 --> 06:14.867
'Course not. That would be
terrible for business.

06:14.891 --> 06:15.614
I'm not an idiot.

06:15.682 --> 06:17.916
Count to three,
but do it on "two."

06:17.984 --> 06:20.452
I'll keep it on ice until art
crawl's over. Thanks, T.

06:20.519 --> 06:22.304
Here goes. Now listen, gene.

06:22.372 --> 06:24.940
I'm gonna have trouble cutting
through the cartilage at first.

06:26.543 --> 06:29.244
While I'm doing it,
just think about your art.

06:29.312 --> 06:30.963
Okay!
All right. Ready?

06:31.030 --> 06:32.531
Ninja robot. Ninja robot.
Ninja robot.

06:32.599 --> 06:34.383
One... two...

06:34.450 --> 06:35.834
Hey, kids.
Oh, hey, dad.

06:35.885 --> 06:38.604
I had to get away
from those anuses for a while.

06:38.671 --> 06:42.441
You mean Mort and Teddy? No. No.
Your... Gayle's paintings.

06:42.508 --> 06:43.976
What are you kids doing?
What knife?!

06:44.043 --> 06:45.854
What do you mean, what knife?
Why are you holding a knife?

06:45.878 --> 06:47.262
Why am I holding a knife?

06:47.330 --> 06:48.770
She's turning me into a real artist.

06:48.838 --> 06:50.478
No, she's not.
Put the knife down, Louise.

06:50.502 --> 06:51.633
I want to be an artist!

06:51.701 --> 06:53.101
Like Leonardo DiCaprio.

06:53.169 --> 06:54.603
That's right.

06:54.671 --> 06:56.705
That's Da Vinci, gene.
No!

06:56.773 --> 06:58.824
The only way
I can sell this garbage

06:58.891 --> 07:00.325
is if I make them legit!

07:00.393 --> 07:02.244
Hey, wait a second.
I have an idea.

07:02.328 --> 07:04.479
You know who loves the stuff
you kids draw?

07:04.547 --> 07:06.131
You?
No. Your mother.

07:06.199 --> 07:08.483
This crap is like catnip to her.
She can't resist it.

07:08.551 --> 07:10.352
Bring 'em inside.

07:10.420 --> 07:13.021
All right, we need to get
these up before they get back.

07:13.089 --> 07:15.190
Your mom will be so excited
to see this stuff,

07:15.258 --> 07:17.498
she won't even notice that
I took Gayle's paintings down.

07:17.522 --> 07:18.794
Pretty manipulative, dad.

07:18.861 --> 07:20.429
I see where I get it.

07:20.496 --> 07:22.064
Thank you.
You should see my taxes.

07:22.131 --> 07:23.849
Uh, what's this supposed to be?

07:23.917 --> 07:26.317
A ninja robot fighting a vampire
tape recorder at Stonehenge.

07:26.369 --> 07:27.886
Who's that in the background?

07:27.937 --> 07:29.821
That's my friend Ken.
Why is he like that?

07:29.889 --> 07:31.223
He's an albino.

07:31.291 --> 07:32.658
Oh.
Yeah.

07:32.725 --> 07:34.676
I've never met Ken.
Is he real or imaginary?

07:34.744 --> 07:36.395
He's real, and he does
improvised hip-hop.

07:36.446 --> 07:38.447
Okay, how old is he?
He's 28.

07:38.514 --> 07:41.800
You can't have a 28-year-old,
albino friend. Yes, I can!

07:41.868 --> 07:43.588
All right, I can't deal
with this right now.

07:43.612 --> 07:44.786
Tina, what do you got?

07:44.871 --> 07:46.955
It's our dentist. Dr.
Yap? Why is he nude?

07:47.023 --> 07:49.024
Wait, has he been
nude with you, Tina?!

07:49.092 --> 07:51.059
I exercised
some artistic license.

07:51.127 --> 07:53.211
Uh, I...
We're switching dentists.

07:53.279 --> 07:55.330
No! I can't deal
with that right now.

07:55.415 --> 07:58.233
But... Let's get 'em up.

07:58.301 --> 08:00.035
Linda, Gayle.
How was lunch?

08:00.103 --> 08:01.937
Very interesting.

08:02.005 --> 08:05.340
I think... ♪ the waiter might
have been hitting on me. ♪

08:05.408 --> 08:07.592
Yes. He was very attentive.

08:07.644 --> 08:10.245
And he asked you a lot
of questions about food.

08:10.313 --> 08:13.131
What was that all about?
Uh, Bob?

08:13.199 --> 08:14.833
Where are my paintings?

08:14.901 --> 08:17.602
What? Wha...? Oh, I had
to take a few down

08:17.670 --> 08:19.471
to make room
for the kids' stuff.

08:19.539 --> 08:22.007
Bobby! Aw.
The kids' stuff!

08:22.075 --> 08:25.143
Yeah. It's like our wall is a
giant refrigerator. I love it.

08:25.211 --> 08:27.713
Huh. Gee, Bob,
if I didn't know any better,

08:27.780 --> 08:30.215
I'd think...
You didn't like my paintings.

08:30.283 --> 08:31.717
What, no? I...

08:31.784 --> 08:33.217
Aw.
No, no, no.

08:33.285 --> 08:35.386
I know when
I'm being lied to, Bob.

08:35.455 --> 08:38.056
It's like when I look at myself
in the mirror and say,

08:38.124 --> 08:40.292
"it's going to be okay."

08:40.360 --> 08:42.126
Fine, look, Gayle, I'm
gonna level with you.

08:42.178 --> 08:44.846
No. No, Bob.
No. No levelling. No.

08:44.914 --> 08:45.714
Here we go.

08:45.782 --> 08:47.632
Gayle,

08:47.700 --> 08:49.500
the thing about your paintings...
Bobby! Ah...

08:49.524 --> 08:51.737
Oh, look, senior
visitors! Yay!

08:51.804 --> 08:54.022
Oh. Well, look who it is.

08:54.090 --> 08:56.174
Great. The art
store people.

08:56.242 --> 08:57.676
Oh! Reflections.

08:57.744 --> 08:59.511
I love that store!

08:59.579 --> 09:01.246
I love your yarn.

09:01.314 --> 09:02.764
What can we get for you?

09:02.832 --> 09:04.700
I'm not here as a patron.

09:04.767 --> 09:06.802
I'm here as Edith Cranwinkle,

09:06.869 --> 09:08.754
chairperson of the art crawl.

09:08.821 --> 09:11.089
I rushed right over here
because there are murmurs,

09:11.157 --> 09:13.325
whispers and murmurs
around town,

09:13.393 --> 09:15.594
that you're displaying...

09:15.661 --> 09:18.530
Certain offensive
orifices during the art crawl.

09:18.598 --> 09:20.515
Offices?
Orifices!

09:21.551 --> 09:23.001
Not anymore.

09:23.069 --> 09:24.269
I took them all down.

09:24.337 --> 09:25.870
Oh, what a relief.

09:25.922 --> 09:27.556
I'm glad you agree
with my decision.

09:27.623 --> 09:29.024
Your decision?
What decision?

09:29.092 --> 09:31.159
That you can't display
that type of art here.

09:31.227 --> 09:32.661
Wait. I can't?

09:32.729 --> 09:34.362
Absolutely not!
It's obscene.

09:34.430 --> 09:36.398
Obscene.
Oh, really?

09:36.466 --> 09:38.500
Yes. I won't allow it.

09:38.568 --> 09:40.602
Excuse me?
You won't allow it?

09:40.686 --> 09:42.437
That's right, Tubsy.
You heard her.

09:42.505 --> 09:46.007
Who are you two to tell me what
I can or can't hang on my wall?

09:46.075 --> 09:48.393
I am chairperson
of the art crawl.

09:48.461 --> 09:50.221
Well, I'm the chairperson
of this restaurant.

09:50.245 --> 09:52.564
And you know what?
They're gonna go back up.

09:52.632 --> 09:53.999
How dare you!

09:54.067 --> 09:56.268
Aw, Bobby!

09:56.335 --> 09:58.086
Gene, Louise, go
get the paintings.

09:58.171 --> 09:59.704
Here they are!

09:59.772 --> 10:01.339
Step into the butt closet!

10:01.407 --> 10:03.275
I will not!
You should try it.

10:03.342 --> 10:04.443
I will not!

10:04.510 --> 10:05.977
What's it going to take

10:06.045 --> 10:07.525
to get you into this
rhino anus today?

10:07.580 --> 10:11.483
You are in direct violation
of my wife, Bob.

10:11.551 --> 10:12.984
Oh, I am, am I?

10:13.052 --> 10:14.519
Well, how about this?

10:14.587 --> 10:15.887
Horse anus.
Oh! Oh!

10:15.955 --> 10:17.889
Look at it.
No!

10:17.957 --> 10:19.424
Oh.
Chicken anus.

10:19.492 --> 10:20.692
No!
Take a closer look.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.627
Fox anus.
Harold!

10:22.695 --> 10:25.197
Gayle, I'm commissioning a
new series of anus paintings.

10:25.264 --> 10:27.899
Two words... bigger and more.

10:27.950 --> 10:29.701
Oh!
Out!

10:29.768 --> 10:31.119
Aah!
I cast you out.

10:31.204 --> 10:33.071
Oh, my gosh.

10:38.100 --> 10:39.567
Keep 'em coming, Gayle!

10:39.634 --> 10:41.168
Almost done!

10:41.236 --> 10:44.505
Oh, my, I feel like
I could fall into this one!

10:44.573 --> 10:47.875
Bob, I thought you didn't want
to become the anus restaurant.

10:47.943 --> 10:49.276
Well, I've embraced it.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.779
We are the anus restaurant, Lin.

10:51.847 --> 10:54.215
A-nus! A-nus! Kids.

10:54.282 --> 10:56.750
A-nus! A-nus! A-nus!

10:56.818 --> 10:59.019
That's right!
Go tell your friends!

10:59.087 --> 11:01.789
Or don't. Either way.
It's your choice.

11:01.857 --> 11:03.390
Hey, you asked for this, Lin.

11:03.458 --> 11:05.426
I'm just doing what
you wanted me to do,

11:05.494 --> 11:06.827
support your sister.

11:06.895 --> 11:08.829
Oh, what a crock of crap!

11:08.897 --> 11:11.765
This is about you and your
pride and that Edith.

11:11.833 --> 11:13.801
And you just want
to provoke her.

11:13.869 --> 11:15.302
Damn right, I do.

11:15.387 --> 11:17.471
This one

11:17.556 --> 11:19.056
big enough for you, Edith?!

11:24.229 --> 11:26.197
Fresh from their
triumphant debut

11:26.264 --> 11:27.882
at Bob's burgers!

11:27.949 --> 11:29.950
That's right,
gallery-quality paintings

11:30.035 --> 11:31.368
at sidewalk prices.

11:31.436 --> 11:33.287
Art lover, check this out!

11:33.355 --> 11:34.905
Hey, that's Dr. yap.

11:34.973 --> 11:36.493
He's my dentist.
That's a good likeness

11:36.517 --> 11:37.708
in the face, but, uh...

11:37.776 --> 11:39.193
The proportions are off.

11:39.261 --> 11:41.228
No, I... the
proportions are right.

11:41.296 --> 11:43.230
Well, I'm getting adult braces.

11:43.298 --> 11:45.282
So?
So I should know!

11:45.350 --> 11:48.052
Dr. yap has short, strong
legs, and his torso is...

11:48.119 --> 11:50.304
Well, I'm off to do
some more roller-skating!

11:50.372 --> 11:53.140
You know what?
I've done all I can for you hacks.

11:53.225 --> 11:55.125
You refuse
to paint touristy art,

11:55.193 --> 11:57.661
dad won't let me cut off
gene's ear... we're through!

11:57.729 --> 11:59.196
We are through!

11:59.264 --> 12:00.898
I'm dropping you as my clients,

12:00.965 --> 12:03.517
and I'm dropping you
as my siblings!

12:03.585 --> 12:06.220
Go take some art classes,
you wannabes!

12:07.756 --> 12:08.989
Hey, Andy, Ollie.
Hm? Huh?

12:09.057 --> 12:10.057
You, too, red.
Huh?

12:10.125 --> 12:12.493
Come here.

12:12.561 --> 12:14.028
You ever heard of the game,

12:14.095 --> 12:16.580
"you guys paint whatever I
say and then I sell it"?

12:16.648 --> 12:18.983
Does the winner
get a hug from Ollie?

12:19.050 --> 12:22.586
Ah, Andy, you can have
one of those any old time.

12:22.654 --> 12:23.954
Now?

12:25.624 --> 12:27.191
All right, stop hugging!
Let's paint!

12:27.259 --> 12:29.894
Let's paint shells
and sunsets and crap!

12:29.961 --> 12:30.961
Yay! Yay!
Yay!

12:32.964 --> 12:34.999
Attention everyone!

12:35.066 --> 12:37.368
This installation
is not approved

12:37.435 --> 12:39.637
by the art crawl association.

12:39.704 --> 12:42.706
It's obscene, and should
be taken down immediately!

12:42.774 --> 12:45.242
Well, I'll tell you this...
it doesn't need

12:45.310 --> 12:48.145
to be approved by the
art crawl association,

12:48.213 --> 12:51.181
because this is now a
permanent installation.

12:52.234 --> 12:53.234
Permanent?

12:53.268 --> 12:54.435
You'll regret this, Bob!

12:54.502 --> 12:55.970
Oh, is that a threat?

12:56.037 --> 12:57.905
Oh, when I threaten you,
you'll know it!

12:57.973 --> 13:00.608
Yeah, when she threatens you,
you'll know it!

13:00.675 --> 13:01.875
Okay, was that a threat?

13:01.943 --> 13:03.077
You bet it was!

13:03.144 --> 13:04.411
Is that supposed to scare me?

13:04.479 --> 13:06.530
Defi...

13:08.600 --> 13:09.633
Yes.

13:11.436 --> 13:12.920
You want some water?

13:12.988 --> 13:15.189
He would never drink your water!

13:15.257 --> 13:17.291
I really need s...

13:17.359 --> 13:19.026
He's fine!

13:19.094 --> 13:20.461
You're fine.

13:20.528 --> 13:22.062
I could use some water.

13:22.130 --> 13:23.130
You're fine.

13:23.198 --> 13:24.565
Bob, water.
No!

13:24.633 --> 13:26.967
He'd rather die
than drink your water!

13:27.035 --> 13:29.403
I wouldn't!
Yes, he would!

13:29.487 --> 13:31.272
I'll drink it!
No, water, Harold!

13:31.356 --> 13:32.806
Please!
Never!

13:46.638 --> 13:48.405
Edith!

13:48.456 --> 13:51.492
Unbelievable.
This is nuts.

13:51.559 --> 13:54.028
I can't believe Edith would do this.

13:54.095 --> 13:55.362
My artwork!

13:55.430 --> 13:57.014
It's ruined!

13:57.082 --> 14:00.534
They painted underpants
on my beautiful anuses!

14:00.602 --> 14:03.404
Gayle, Gayle, no need
to go off the deep end, okay?

14:03.471 --> 14:05.656
You should be flattered, right?

14:05.724 --> 14:07.691
All the great artists
get censored.

14:07.759 --> 14:10.377
They do not.
Yes, yes! All of 'em do.

14:10.445 --> 14:11.912
Every... all
the good ones.

14:11.980 --> 14:13.914
Oh, God, what a whirlwind
we've been on.

14:13.982 --> 14:17.184
I feel like let's just put this
all behind us and move on.

14:17.252 --> 14:19.119
I'm going down there.
What? Where?

14:19.187 --> 14:20.421
To see Edith.

14:20.488 --> 14:22.573
Bobby, don't do anything crazy.

14:22.641 --> 14:24.274
I'm not crazy, they're crazy!

14:24.342 --> 14:26.427
And they're not gonna
get away with it!

14:28.179 --> 14:30.381
Glue that shell
in the middle, Andy!

14:30.448 --> 14:32.199
What are you doing?!

14:32.267 --> 14:33.651
My hand is cramping up!

14:33.718 --> 14:35.102
I ate too much glue!

14:35.170 --> 14:37.404
Andy, Ollie, come here.

14:37.472 --> 14:41.108
Listen, I'm pushing you because
you've got talent, babies.

14:41.176 --> 14:44.912
And I'm gonna take care of you,
oh, you better believe it.

14:44.979 --> 14:48.048
But first you've got
to make some money for mommy.

14:48.116 --> 14:49.683
Okay, babies?

14:49.751 --> 14:51.652
You, too, red.
What's your name, sweetheart?

14:51.720 --> 14:53.354
Devin McJim...
Shut up!

14:53.421 --> 14:54.755
It doesn't matter!

14:54.823 --> 14:57.391
Stop talking!
Start working!

14:57.459 --> 15:01.078
Work! Shells go
in the middle!

15:01.145 --> 15:02.496
Here you go.

15:02.564 --> 15:04.098
One-of-a-kind original.

15:04.165 --> 15:07.334
Help support these poor,
deformed orphans.

15:07.402 --> 15:09.036
20 bucks.

15:11.506 --> 15:12.506
Dad's pissed.

15:12.574 --> 15:14.375
That's a take five.

15:14.459 --> 15:16.660
For me! Not you!

15:18.496 --> 15:20.431
Oh, look, everyone,

15:20.498 --> 15:22.299
the town pornographer.

15:22.367 --> 15:24.718
Can it, Edith.
I'm here to get an apology.

15:24.786 --> 15:27.087
For what, standing up
for artistic integrity

15:27.155 --> 15:28.756
and common decency?

15:28.823 --> 15:30.491
There's nothing decent
about what you did.

15:30.558 --> 15:33.260
First you tried to tell me
what to put on my walls,

15:33.328 --> 15:34.628
then you vandalised it.

15:34.696 --> 15:36.263
Have you no shame?

15:36.331 --> 15:38.348
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.983
And neither does he.
What?

15:40.051 --> 15:41.268
Hit her, dad!

15:41.336 --> 15:42.970
I'm not gonna hit her, Louise.

15:43.037 --> 15:44.121
Hit her, dad!
Gene?

15:44.189 --> 15:45.789
Tina? What are you
two doing here?

15:45.857 --> 15:47.057
Learning to paint.

15:47.125 --> 15:48.258
We're honing our craft.

15:48.326 --> 15:49.443
Okay, well, good luck

15:49.511 --> 15:51.145
trying to Polish a turd.

15:51.212 --> 15:52.746
Wait, I thought
you hated my kids.

15:52.814 --> 15:55.315
My artwork shop is open
to all who respect art.

15:55.383 --> 15:57.885
So I'll have to
ask you to leave.

15:57.952 --> 15:59.953
Then ask me.
Please leave.

16:00.021 --> 16:02.589
Not before I get an apology.
Not on your life!

16:02.657 --> 16:04.458
Have it your way, art lady!

16:04.526 --> 16:05.609
Hey.

16:05.677 --> 16:07.211
Poke her in the eye
with the brush.

16:07.278 --> 16:08.779
Oh, I've got
a better idea, Louise.

16:08.847 --> 16:10.547
Ha-ha-ha!
Take that!

16:12.294 --> 16:13.294
Dad, what is that?

16:13.318 --> 16:14.752
It's an anus.

16:14.819 --> 16:16.386
Oh...
What else would it be?

16:16.438 --> 16:18.272
What has this been all about?

16:18.339 --> 16:19.473
You call that an anus?

16:19.541 --> 16:21.141
It looks just like a black dot!

16:21.209 --> 16:22.543
What kind of anus is that?

16:22.610 --> 16:24.111
Oh!
Well, then, Harold,

16:24.179 --> 16:26.480
it looks like I'll need
to practice a little more.

16:26.548 --> 16:28.048
I'll say.
How about one right here!

16:29.150 --> 16:30.551
And what about here!
Ow!

16:30.618 --> 16:32.052
This one might need an anus!

16:32.120 --> 16:34.121
Aah!
How about this lighthouse!

16:34.189 --> 16:36.156
It has an anus now!

16:36.224 --> 16:37.357
Looking good, dad.

16:37.425 --> 16:38.192
Thanks, teen.

16:38.259 --> 16:39.259
Rip that lighthouse

16:39.327 --> 16:40.377
a new one, dad!

16:40.445 --> 16:41.962
I feel so alive!

16:42.030 --> 16:43.964
This is what God must feel like.

16:44.032 --> 16:46.533
Kids, tell your mother
not to wait up!

16:46.601 --> 16:50.003
Use the brown!
Use the brown!

16:53.827 --> 16:55.394
You should've seen it, mom.

16:55.462 --> 16:56.896
Dad went nuts!

16:56.964 --> 16:58.764
Aw, Bobby, what'd you do?

16:58.832 --> 16:59.966
I got justice, Lin.

17:00.033 --> 17:02.134
Dad painted an anus
on a lighthouse.

17:02.202 --> 17:03.836
Yeah.
And on a Mountain

17:03.904 --> 17:06.571
and on a sunset
and on a sailboat...

17:06.640 --> 17:08.608
And on Dr. yap.
And Ken.

17:08.675 --> 17:10.876
Yeah, I'm sorry I painted
on your paintings, kids.

17:10.944 --> 17:12.712
They were in the line of fire.

17:12.779 --> 17:15.181
You painted anuses on paintings?
Where's Gayle?

17:15.248 --> 17:17.617
I got to tell her
how I stood up for her.

17:17.684 --> 17:20.619
She's in the basement trying to get
the underwear off her paintings.

17:20.686 --> 17:22.821
You shouldn't have done it, Bob.
Are you kidding, Lin?

17:22.888 --> 17:25.340
It's the best thing
I've ever done in my life.

17:25.409 --> 17:26.709
Ow.
See,

17:26.741 --> 17:28.021
that's how you put on handcuffs.

17:28.045 --> 17:29.478
They don't look
tight enough to me.

17:29.546 --> 17:30.913
Why are these on me?

17:30.981 --> 17:32.882
Because you anally
defaced her property.

17:32.950 --> 17:34.717
But she started it...
look what she did.

17:34.785 --> 17:36.485
Oh. I like the new direction

17:36.553 --> 17:37.987
and wish I could take credit.

17:38.055 --> 17:40.523
But like I said,
I had nothing to do with it.

17:40.590 --> 17:41.724
Yeah, we'll see about that.

17:41.792 --> 17:42.858
I'm pressing charges.

17:42.926 --> 17:44.660
We're gonna take this to court!

17:44.728 --> 17:46.028
Wait, now you're charging her?

17:46.096 --> 17:47.396
This is confusing.

17:47.464 --> 17:48.965
Is dad going to jail?

17:49.032 --> 17:50.916
I'll wait for you.
Word of advice, dad:

17:50.984 --> 17:53.019
Don't tell your cell mate
what you're in for.

17:53.086 --> 17:54.954
I hope our new dad is a blond.

17:55.038 --> 17:57.073
I can't take it anymore!

17:57.140 --> 17:59.625
Edith didn't paint
the underwear! I did it!

18:01.194 --> 18:03.429
What? You painted
all those underpants, Linda?

18:03.497 --> 18:04.864
Oh, I couldn't help it.

18:04.931 --> 18:06.899
Those anuses were haunting me

18:06.967 --> 18:07.967
in my sleep.

18:27.371 --> 18:28.871
Anus! Anus! Anus!

18:28.939 --> 18:31.057
No...!

18:31.124 --> 18:33.626
You were the one who said
we had to support your sister.

18:33.694 --> 18:35.494
I did support her,
until I figured out

18:35.562 --> 18:38.364
a way to destroy her art while
preserving her feelings

18:38.432 --> 18:39.832
and blaming someone else.

18:39.900 --> 18:41.217
I thought those looked familiar.

18:41.284 --> 18:43.185
Oh, yeah!

18:43.253 --> 18:45.705
Mom! You painted
your own underwear!

18:45.772 --> 18:48.591
What? How do you know
what my underwear looks like?

18:48.658 --> 18:49.992
How don't I know?

18:50.060 --> 18:51.327
She wears it around the house,

18:51.395 --> 18:52.862
flaunting it,
like she's all that.

18:52.929 --> 18:54.130
I do not!

18:54.181 --> 18:56.082
Okay, Bobby, let's go to jail.

18:56.149 --> 18:57.833
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Can't I...

18:57.901 --> 18:59.568
Edith, can't I just pay
for the paintings?

18:59.636 --> 19:01.570
Well, the retail value
of what you destroyed

19:01.638 --> 19:03.039
was over a thousand dollars!

19:03.106 --> 19:04.440
We'll give you $200.

19:04.508 --> 19:06.308
We haven't sold a burger
all week, Lin.

19:06.376 --> 19:07.727
We don't have
that kind of money.

19:07.811 --> 19:11.263
I got this one, dad.

19:11.331 --> 19:12.732
Are we good here?

19:12.799 --> 19:14.867
Fine!
We'll take it.

19:14.935 --> 19:16.435
Me and you can settle up later.

19:16.503 --> 19:18.337
Where the hell'd you get
all that money from?

19:18.405 --> 19:19.905
Shh. Don't ask,
don't ask.

19:19.973 --> 19:21.240
It's art crawl.
But...

19:21.324 --> 19:24.076
Shh! Shh, shh, shh, shh,

19:24.161 --> 19:26.162
shut your mouth. It's art crawl.
What... but I...

19:26.229 --> 19:27.947
Shh! Shut your mouth.
But the m...

19:28.014 --> 19:29.415
Shut your mouth.
I...

19:29.483 --> 19:31.567
I said shut your mouth.
It's art crawl.

19:31.635 --> 19:34.253
Come on, Harold, let's
get out of this ass parlour.

19:34.337 --> 19:35.521
It stinks!
O-okay.

19:38.775 --> 19:40.420
You know, Linda, none
of this would have happened

19:40.444 --> 19:42.124
if you'd just been
honest with your sister.

19:42.148 --> 19:43.462
It's true, mom.
I've been honest

19:43.530 --> 19:45.848
with these two
since the day gene got fat.

19:45.899 --> 19:48.000
I remember the ice cream
sandwich that did it.

19:48.068 --> 19:49.435
I regret nothing!

19:49.503 --> 19:51.687
And Tina...
bad breath every day.

19:51.755 --> 19:52.972
Not if you like fish.

19:53.039 --> 19:54.356
See how tough they are?

19:54.424 --> 19:55.491
We've been desensitised.

19:55.559 --> 19:56.692
I'm so numb.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.127
All right, from now on,

19:58.195 --> 20:00.196
I'm going to be honest
with my sister.

20:00.247 --> 20:01.730
She deserves to know the truth.

20:01.798 --> 20:03.532
I did it! I did it!

20:03.583 --> 20:05.451
I fixed all the paintings!

20:05.519 --> 20:09.221
I added pants
and huge, pendulous breasts.

20:09.289 --> 20:11.640
Oh, I'm so excited!
I think it's my best work ever.

20:11.708 --> 20:12.708
What do you think?

20:14.161 --> 20:15.327
I'm not hearing anything.

20:16.857 --> 20:17.857
Oh, my God.

20:17.881 --> 20:20.049
Gayle, it's beautiful.

20:20.117 --> 20:21.877
They're great. They look great.
Great. Great!

20:21.901 --> 20:22.785
They're great!

20:22.853 --> 20:24.420
Fantastic!
Yes, they are...

20:24.488 --> 20:26.388
Yeah, look at that!
Very, very...

20:26.456 --> 20:28.274
I knew it!
I knew they were great!

20:28.341 --> 20:29.975
Here, you hang these,

20:30.043 --> 20:32.795
and I'm gonna go back down
and finish the rest of 'em.

20:32.863 --> 20:34.697
Oh, I couldn't do it.
I wouldn't have done it.

20:34.764 --> 20:36.549
There's exceptions
to the honesty policy.

20:36.616 --> 20:39.218
Yeah, yeah, I mean, Lin,
you did the right thing.

20:39.286 --> 20:40.920
Oh, thank you for supporting me.

20:40.987 --> 20:43.506
I want to hug
each and every one of you!

20:43.573 --> 20:45.307
Come here, all of you!
Come on! All right.

20:45.375 --> 20:47.977
Oh, I love my family!

20:48.044 --> 20:49.278
I love you!

20:49.329 --> 20:51.130
Let me out of your love jail!

20:53.016 --> 20:55.317
Do you think she's coming back?

20:55.385 --> 20:57.353
I don't know.
I'm so cold.

20:57.420 --> 20:59.788
Cut me open and crawl inside me.

20:59.856 --> 21:02.191
One of us should live.
Okay.

21:02.259 --> 21:03.926
Mama's comin' back,

21:03.994 --> 21:06.896
and mama better
see some paintings!
