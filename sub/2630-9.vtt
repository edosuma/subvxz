WEBVTT

00:04.629 --> 00:05.879
What am I sitting on?

00:06.381 --> 00:07.840
Top of the world?

00:08.173 --> 00:09.925
Dock of the bay?

00:10.969 --> 00:12.052
I'm out.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.598
- Oh, ew, undies! Oh.
- Oh!

00:18.268 --> 00:21.145
All right, whose are they?

00:21.396 --> 00:23.522
- Whose are they?
- Not mine.

00:23.773 --> 00:25.399
Joey's. Got to be Joey's.

00:30.238 --> 00:31.280
They're mine.

00:31.531 --> 00:34.366
See, Joey's. They're Joe-Joe-Joey's.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.452
Why are they here?

00:37.120 --> 00:38.704
I don't know, uh...

00:40.999 --> 00:42.458
I'm Joey.

00:43.501 --> 00:44.585
I'm disgusting.

00:44.794 --> 00:47.546
I take my underwear off
in other people's homes.

00:49.424 --> 00:52.259
Get them out of here.
What's wrong with you?

00:52.427 --> 00:53.469
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.140
- Take them!
- I got them.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.351
You can touch them. They're yours.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.317
Chandler? A word?

01:08.485 --> 01:09.902
Yeah.

01:16.659 --> 01:21.163
I'm tired of covering for you two.
This has got to stop. Aah.

01:22.707 --> 01:24.917
Tighty-whiteys? What are you, 8?

01:26.461 --> 01:28.504
Thank you, Joey, so much.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.255
You're not welcome, okay?

01:30.757 --> 01:34.343
Look, I hate this.
You guys keep embarrassing me.

01:34.594 --> 01:38.097
Yesterday, Rachel found
your razor in our bathroom.

01:38.306 --> 01:42.434
I said it was mine, and that
I was playing a woman in a play.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.480
Then one thing led
to another and...

01:51.986 --> 01:54.947
And around the ankles,
that is a tough spot.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.865
It was. All right, listen...

01:57.117 --> 01:59.535
All this lying has been
hard on us too.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.329
Yeah, I bet all the sex
makes it easier.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.749
Yeah, actually.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.502
We'll be more careful.

02:08.752 --> 02:12.673
We don't want them to know,
because it's going really well.

02:13.383 --> 02:16.468
And maybe it's going well
because it's a secret.

02:16.719 --> 02:20.222
It sounds weird,
but we're so bad at relationships.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.516
- We are. Help us.
- Help.

02:24.435 --> 02:28.105
All right. But you do it with me once.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.193
Joey!

02:33.403 --> 02:34.528
Didn't think so.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.790
- Hey, Phoebe.
- Hey, Pheebs.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.083
What are you reading?

03:30.251 --> 03:31.793
Um, Wuthering Heights.

03:32.003 --> 03:36.006
I have to finish it by tomorrow
for my literature class.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.508
You're taking a class? That's so cool.

03:38.843 --> 03:41.845
I really liked
that Lamaze class I took.

03:42.096 --> 03:45.807
I thought this time I'd go
for something more intellectual...

03:46.059 --> 03:48.393
...with a less painful final exam.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.313
That sounds like fun.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.774
Oh, you should come with me!

03:54.025 --> 03:56.235
Then I'll have someone to sit with.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.444
Okay.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.322
Yay! Okay.
Ooh, but, do you have time to read it?

04:00.490 --> 04:01.573
I read it in school.

04:01.741 --> 04:05.702
This is going to be so much fun!
Shh. I have to finish.

04:09.958 --> 04:10.999
Hi.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.502
What's wrong, buddy?

04:13.670 --> 04:16.046
Someone at work ate my sandwich.

04:18.048 --> 04:20.091
What did the police say?

04:21.094 --> 04:24.054
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.139
I can't believe someone ate it.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.641
It's just a sandwich.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.476
Just a sandwich?

04:29.727 --> 04:31.645
I am 30 years old, okay?

04:31.896 --> 04:34.189
I'll be divorced twice and
I got evicted.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.693
That sandwich was
the only good thing in my life!

04:37.902 --> 04:41.697
Someone ate the only good thing
going on in my life!

04:43.700 --> 04:46.034
I have enough for one more sandwich.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.787
I was going to eat it myself, but...

04:50.248 --> 04:53.959
Mon, that would be incredible.
Thank you so much.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.170
I still can't believe someone ate it!

04:59.340 --> 05:01.550
Look, I left a note and everything.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.219
"Knock-knock."
"Who's there?"

05:04.470 --> 05:06.263
"Ross Geller's lunch."

05:07.181 --> 05:09.224
"Ross Geller's lunch, who?"

05:09.559 --> 05:13.312
"Ross Geller's lunch.
Please don't take me. Okay?"

05:14.981 --> 05:17.274
I'm surprised you didn't wear it home.
Ha-ha-ha.

05:19.068 --> 05:21.778
Want to keep your food?
Scare people off.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.572
I learned that on the street.

05:23.740 --> 05:24.781
Really?

05:25.491 --> 05:27.326
What would you say, Pheebs?

05:27.535 --> 05:31.621
Stuff like, uh,
"Keep your mitts off my grub."

05:33.249 --> 05:37.711
Do you picture Phoebe on the street
with the entire cast of Annie?

05:40.340 --> 05:43.216
This'll keep them away from your stuff.

05:46.387 --> 05:48.055
Whoa!

05:49.724 --> 05:51.683
Phoebe, you are a badass!

05:53.227 --> 05:55.854
Someday I'll tell you
how I stabbed the cop.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.523
- Phoebe.
- He stabbed me first!

06:02.612 --> 06:05.947
The BrontÃ« sisters were
remarkable women for their time.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.533
They lived in a patriarchal society.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.660
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.

06:11.245 --> 06:13.038
- Ahem.
- Okay.

06:13.748 --> 06:16.291
So, what is the book about?

06:16.542 --> 06:18.293
Didn't you read it in high school?

06:18.503 --> 06:21.546
I started it, but then
there was this pep rally.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.548
And I was on top of the pyramid.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.550
But anyway, um...

06:25.760 --> 06:26.802
...what's the book about?

06:28.054 --> 06:31.765
It's a tragic love story
between Cathy and Heathcliff.

06:32.016 --> 06:34.893
It takes place on these
creepy moors in England.

06:35.144 --> 06:39.231
Which I think represent the wildness
of Heathcliff's character.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.149
I totally get symbolism.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.320
How would you characterize
the theme of this book?

06:45.488 --> 06:47.906
Uh, let's see... Rachel Green?

06:51.744 --> 06:53.286
Ahem, um...

06:53.454 --> 06:57.290
I would have to say
that it's a tragic love story.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.252
That's sort of a given...

07:00.461 --> 07:02.421
...but, yes. Anyone else?

07:03.047 --> 07:04.756
Oh, oh, oh. Symbolism!

07:07.802 --> 07:10.178
And the wildness of the moors...

07:10.430 --> 07:12.889
...which I think, is mirrored...

07:13.141 --> 07:16.560
...in the wildness
of, uh, Heathcliff's character.

07:18.062 --> 07:21.648
Excellent! What Rachel
has shrewdly observed here...

07:23.109 --> 07:24.985
You completely stole my answer!

07:25.236 --> 07:26.987
Honey, that was pretty obvious.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.489
How would you know?
You didn't read it!

07:31.492 --> 07:34.911
What do you think?
Uh, you in the blue shirt?

07:37.540 --> 07:42.210
I think that, um, yours is a question
with many possible answers.

07:43.588 --> 07:48.383
Would you care to venture one?

07:50.052 --> 07:54.514
Are you just repeating me?

07:56.726 --> 07:58.351
All right. Let's move on.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.312
Okay, then.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.860
Why didn't you say
you hadn't read the book?

08:07.111 --> 08:09.571
I didn't want him to think I was stupid.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.908
That was really embarrassing,
what happened to you.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.078
- Phoebe! Phoebe!
- Yeah?

08:17.580 --> 08:18.830
Your note?

08:19.248 --> 08:20.290
Amazing!

08:20.833 --> 08:23.168
Not only did no one
touch my sandwich...

08:23.419 --> 08:26.213
...but people at work are
actually afraid of me.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.465
A guy called me "Mental."

08:28.716 --> 08:30.133
"Mental Geller."

08:30.718 --> 08:33.470
I've always wanted
a cool nickname like that.

08:34.847 --> 08:38.390
The best you got in high school
was, uh, "Wet Pants Geller."

08:38.643 --> 08:40.393
It was the water fountain, okay?

08:42.522 --> 08:43.605
Anyway...

08:45.316 --> 08:47.150
...people are writing reports for me...

08:47.318 --> 08:50.070
...uh, pushing back deadlines
to fit my schedule.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.531
I tell you,
you get tough with people...

08:52.740 --> 08:55.534
...and you can get anything you want.

08:55.743 --> 08:58.745
Hey, Tribbiani!
Give me that coffee! Now!

09:08.589 --> 09:10.173
This was really fun.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.593
I've been wondering
if you'd ask me out.

09:13.844 --> 09:16.179
So you, uh, still wondering?

09:17.098 --> 09:19.266
No. We just went out.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.436
You're smart.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.522
I like that.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.441
Oh.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.281
Oh, candles!

09:36.367 --> 09:37.951
What is that, a blanket?

09:38.202 --> 09:40.662
A video camera? Oh, my God!

09:40.830 --> 09:42.038
No, no, no. Wait.

09:42.206 --> 09:47.335
I can't believe you thought you'd
tape us having sex on the first date!

09:52.300 --> 09:53.341
Hi.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.470
Joey, is what she just said, um...

09:58.723 --> 09:59.973
Oh, my God!

10:00.224 --> 10:01.683
You're actually going...

10:06.564 --> 10:08.106
What is going on here?

10:10.776 --> 10:14.029
And with Chandler in the next room.
What are you, sick?

10:19.368 --> 10:20.785
I'm Joey.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.665
I mean, I'm disgusting.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.545
I make low-budget adult films.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.052
Huh.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.974
You promised to be more careful!

10:43.225 --> 10:46.311
The good Joey name's been
dragged through the mud!

10:48.522 --> 10:49.564
We're so sorry.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.274
I'm telling everyone.

10:51.484 --> 10:56.279
It's the only explanation that
doesn't make me look like a pig!

10:56.656 --> 10:58.323
No, there's a better explanation.

10:58.574 --> 11:02.077
Tell them you had to make
an adult film for your...

11:02.286 --> 11:04.537
...adult film class.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.457
I like that. But no!

11:07.708 --> 11:11.002
How does that explain
my underwear at your place?

11:12.546 --> 11:13.672
I don't know.

11:14.548 --> 11:17.467
Get ready to come out
of the non-gay closet.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.763
I promise to come up with something.
Just give us time.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.182
All right.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.519
But it better make me look really good.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.230
And another thing:

11:30.690 --> 11:32.065
The video camera?

11:32.316 --> 11:33.566
Nice!

11:41.575 --> 11:42.701
Ross?

11:43.285 --> 11:44.452
May I have a word?

11:44.704 --> 11:45.995
Of course, Donald.

11:46.872 --> 11:51.126
We've been getting reports
of very angry behavior on your part.

11:51.460 --> 11:52.836
- What?
- Threatening letters...

11:53.087 --> 11:54.963
...refusal to meet deadlines.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.800
Apparently people now call you Mental.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.428
Yeah.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.765
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.

12:05.933 --> 12:07.851
Oh, no. Uh, you...

12:08.018 --> 12:10.520
You don't understand. This is so silly.

12:10.688 --> 12:14.357
Um, this is all just
because of a sandwich.

12:15.484 --> 12:16.860
A sandwich?

12:17.319 --> 12:21.656
You see, my sister makes
these amazing turkey sandwiches.

12:21.991 --> 12:26.953
Her secret is, she puts an extra slice
of gravy-soaked bread in the middle.

12:27.204 --> 12:29.038
I call it "The Moistmaker."

12:30.040 --> 12:32.500
Anyway, I put my sandwich
in the fridge...

12:32.668 --> 12:35.295
Ha-ha-ha. Oh, you know what?

12:35.546 --> 12:36.755
I'm sorry.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.923
I believe I ate that.

12:43.471 --> 12:44.888
You ate my sandwich?

12:45.431 --> 12:47.640
A simple mistake.
It can happen to anyone.

12:47.892 --> 12:48.933
Oh, really?

12:51.395 --> 12:56.524
Did you confuse it with your own
turkey sandwich with a Moistmaker?

12:57.401 --> 12:58.443
No, I...

12:58.652 --> 13:00.361
Do you, perhaps, remember...

13:00.571 --> 13:04.115
...seeing a note on top of it?

13:04.366 --> 13:08.453
There may have been a joke
or limerick of some kind.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.538
That said it was...

13:10.748 --> 13:12.582
...my sandwich!

13:13.417 --> 13:14.918
Now calm down.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.254
Look in my office.
Some may be in the trash.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.382
What?

13:22.676 --> 13:26.095
It was quite large.
I had to throw most of it away.

13:28.098 --> 13:30.850
You threw my sandwich away?

13:31.977 --> 13:36.231
My sandwich?

13:38.442 --> 13:39.484
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.277
What's this book about?

13:41.529 --> 13:42.862
You didn't read it, either?

13:43.113 --> 13:46.658
I was going to, but I, uh, accidentally
read something else.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.660
- What?
- Vogue.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.455
So tell me about Jane Eyre.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.207
No, read it yourself.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.293
Come on,
don't be such a goody-goody.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.504
Fine.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.841
All right. So Jane Eyre?

14:03.092 --> 14:05.760
First you'd think she's a woman,
but she's not.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.345
She's a cyborg.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.308
A cyborg? Isn't that like a robot?

14:13.352 --> 14:16.312
This book was light years
ahead of its time.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.316
Sorry I'm late.
Let's get started.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.987
What did you think of Jane Eyre?

14:24.154 --> 14:29.409
Um, Rachel and I were discussing it,
and she had very interesting insights.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.120
Go ahead, Rachel.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.747
Um, thank you, Phoebe.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.961
What struck me most
when reading Jane Eyre...

14:40.170 --> 14:43.339
...was, uh, how the book was
so ahead of its time.

14:43.591 --> 14:47.343
If you're talking about feminism,
I think you're right.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.891
Well, feminism, yes. But also the robots.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.147
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.735
Since that video camera thing
didn't work out...

15:04.653 --> 15:08.948
...I thought that I would give you
just a little preview.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.784
You're naked!

15:12.036 --> 15:13.077
I know!

15:24.423 --> 15:25.465
Ross?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.718
Hey, Chandler.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.095
Monica!

15:31.847 --> 15:33.097
Are you okay?

15:33.349 --> 15:34.724
I'm fine.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.644
I saw a psychiatrist at work today.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.062
Why?

15:39.355 --> 15:41.272
On account of my rage.

15:42.399 --> 15:46.069
Which, if I may say,
right now is out of control.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.656
He gave me a pill for it.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.367
A pill?

15:52.534 --> 15:55.870
Uh-huh. When the psychiatrist told me
to take a leave of absence...

15:56.080 --> 16:00.375
...because I yelled at my boss,
I started to get worked up again.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.294
So he offered me a tranquilizer.

16:03.545 --> 16:05.838
And I thought it was a good idea.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.590
So I took it.

16:09.593 --> 16:12.387
They're making you take time off work?

16:12.596 --> 16:13.930
And you're okay with that?

16:14.306 --> 16:15.723
I don't know.

16:16.350 --> 16:19.811
It's going to be weird
not having a job for a while.

16:20.062 --> 16:23.231
But I definitely don't care
about my sandwich.

16:25.734 --> 16:30.238
It's so embarrassing! I can't believe
you let me go on like that!

16:30.447 --> 16:31.864
I'm sorry.

16:34.326 --> 16:37.996
It was so funny when you compared
Jane Eyre to Robocop.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.208
That was not funny!

16:42.418 --> 16:46.004
I snapped, okay?
You weren't taking the class seriously.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.214
Come on! What is the big deal?

16:48.424 --> 16:51.175
I thought it'd be something
we could do together.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.802
I thought it would be fun.

16:53.053 --> 16:54.387
Fun is good.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.597
But I also wanted to learn.

16:56.849 --> 17:01.352
People talk about what they learned
in high school. I never went.

17:01.729 --> 17:02.937
Oh.

17:03.939 --> 17:06.523
So you really wanted to learn.

17:08.609 --> 17:11.570
You know, Pheebs,
I just wanted to have fun.

17:12.656 --> 17:13.990
You know who should go?

17:14.241 --> 17:16.325
I know! I know! I know!

17:18.037 --> 17:20.829
Monica, you asked the question.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.672
Oh, yeah.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.893
Oh, my God, that's Monica!

17:43.062 --> 17:44.103
Oh, no, no, no!

17:45.522 --> 17:48.900
You get away from me,
you sick, sick, sicko!

17:49.693 --> 17:50.860
What's going on?

17:51.361 --> 17:53.529
Joey has got a secret peephole!

17:55.532 --> 17:56.824
Oh, no, no, no, no!

17:57.076 --> 17:58.826
He has a naked picture of Monica!

17:59.078 --> 18:02.622
He takes naked pictures of us, then
he eats chicken and looks at them!

18:05.876 --> 18:08.544
- Look.
- Oh! Dude, that's my sister!

18:08.796 --> 18:10.088
Give me that!

18:10.339 --> 18:12.673
Wait! Everybody calm down, okay?

18:12.925 --> 18:17.220
Let's give our friend a chance
to explain why he's such a big pervert!

18:18.972 --> 18:21.015
I am not a pervert, okay?

18:21.225 --> 18:22.600
It's just...

18:22.810 --> 18:23.851
I just kind of...

18:25.479 --> 18:27.647
I think I can explain this.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.190
Thank you.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.360
Joey's a sex addict.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.488
What? No, I'm not!

18:35.739 --> 18:37.949
It's okay! It's good!

18:39.660 --> 18:41.577
It's a disease.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.122
I am not a sex addict!

18:44.373 --> 18:45.790
Yes, you are!

18:46.708 --> 18:49.210
That's the only way
to explain all this stuff!

18:49.419 --> 18:51.170
No, it isn't. It's not.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.965
Because you could also explain it
with the truth!

18:55.175 --> 18:56.259
What is the truth?

18:56.468 --> 18:58.261
- What's up?
- What's going on?

19:04.226 --> 19:06.144
I slept with Monica.

19:12.359 --> 19:15.862
Well, let's see what everybody
thinks of that.

19:19.366 --> 19:20.783
Oh, no.

19:21.743 --> 19:23.703
You slept with my sister?

19:24.663 --> 19:26.330
Uh, yes, but it was...

19:26.582 --> 19:28.666
We just did it once, uh, in London.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.710
This is not good for my rage.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.549
Monica.

19:36.717 --> 19:37.758
Is this true?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.260
Of course, it's true.

19:40.220 --> 19:44.390
How else would you explain all the
weird stuff that's been going on?

19:45.976 --> 19:47.018
Yes, it's true.

19:49.521 --> 19:53.191
If it happened once, how come we
found your underwear in our apartment?

19:53.358 --> 19:56.194
Uh... Oh!

19:56.361 --> 19:59.447
That was the underwear
I was wearing that night in London.

19:59.698 --> 20:00.990
Right, Monica?

20:04.328 --> 20:06.287
I guess I wanted to keep it...

20:07.623 --> 20:08.789
...as a souvenir.

20:11.084 --> 20:12.752
My God, Monica!

20:13.712 --> 20:17.048
Are you sure you're not
just a sex addict?

20:18.884 --> 20:19.926
No!

20:20.135 --> 20:23.346
If anyone's a sex addict here,
it's Monica.

20:24.848 --> 20:28.517
She has been trying to get me back
in the sack ever since London!

20:29.561 --> 20:32.396
That's why she gave you
a naked picture of herself.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.065
That makes sense.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.151
And the video camera?

20:37.319 --> 20:39.111
Uh, Monica?

20:41.823 --> 20:46.077
I guess I set up the video camera
to try and entice Joey.

20:47.371 --> 20:50.331
But, sadly, I could not be enticed.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.084
Unbelievable!

20:53.335 --> 20:56.003
You really kept Joey's underwear?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.714
Why? Why would you do that?

21:02.594 --> 21:03.970
I'm Monica.

21:05.138 --> 21:06.555
I'm disgusting.

21:08.433 --> 21:11.185
I stalk guys and keep their underpants.

21:15.148 --> 21:16.190
Well...

21:16.400 --> 21:20.403
I think we've all learned
who's disgusting and who's not.

21:20.570 --> 21:21.988
Huh?

21:22.155 --> 21:23.197
All right.

21:23.365 --> 21:26.242
Now, I'm going to get back
to my bucket.

21:27.703 --> 21:30.913
I'm only eating the skin,
so the chicken's up for grabs.

21:37.504 --> 21:39.505
You were making a good point.

21:39.756 --> 21:41.674
I mean, till you got cut off.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.385
What's up with that girl Monica?

21:44.636 --> 21:46.470
I don't know. I didn't come with her.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.017
Hey, everybody!
Everybody, guess what!

21:51.268 --> 21:53.519
I just convinced Carl to give us a test.

21:53.770 --> 21:54.854
Test?

21:55.105 --> 21:57.898
Come on!
Tests make us all better learners!

22:00.110 --> 22:02.778
Oh, yeah!
We should have essay questions!
