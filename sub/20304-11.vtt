WEBVTT

00:01.292 --> 00:03.169
That is not Lamont.

00:03.461 --> 00:05.880
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:06.756 --> 00:08.216
-This... is a bitch.
-(barks)

00:08.299 --> 00:10.218
This man is not 47.

00:10.635 --> 00:14.389
-Castaneda.
-Come on, Wally! This guy's in his 70s.

00:14.764 --> 00:19.144
-Will you... marry me, Grace?
-Oh, Phil.

00:19.561 --> 00:22.147
-She said no to me, Francis.
-Grace?

00:22.480 --> 00:24.190
Mick, I wanna be your snitch.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.818
How much weight were you looking for?

00:26.901 --> 00:28.486
I'm lookin' to do...

00:28.570 --> 00:31.114
-Kilos?
-(chuckles) Pounds.

00:31.531 --> 00:34.534
I went crazy. I choked.

00:35.076 --> 00:38.121
-I ought to quit. I'm a coward.
-Good idea.

00:38.663 --> 00:39.664
(both moaning)

00:41.124 --> 00:43.001
-Look, you're his girl.
-What if I wasn't?

00:43.293 --> 00:44.961
I don't think we should see
each other anymore.

00:45.336 --> 00:47.380
-Is that right?
-I'm gonna kill you, man!

00:47.464 --> 00:49.924
NARRATOR:<i> And now,</i>
<i>tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:50.008 --> 00:51.384
-Hey!
-You guess you're straight, huh?

00:51.468 --> 00:52.677
Man, I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.095
(yells) Teresa!

00:54.471 --> 00:57.182
We're gonna get him, Frank.
Once and for all.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.726
They want you out.
They want another chief coroner.

01:01.811 --> 01:05.190
-Right dog this time, Mr. Anderson?
-Looks like the McCoy.

01:05.273 --> 01:07.150
Wasn't anything different out there today.

01:07.942 --> 01:10.570
There wasn't a damn thing different
from down in the sewer.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.363
I was just as scared.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.324
-Pig squealer!
-Get him out of here.

01:14.407 --> 01:15.950
-Come on!
-Pig squealer!

01:16.034 --> 01:19.162
-Oh, my God.
-You're dead, butterfly.

01:19.662 --> 01:22.749
Why wasn't the body available
for a second autopsy?

01:22.832 --> 01:24.417
The body had been cremated.

01:25.376 --> 01:29.756
There are still frontiers of passion
for us to penetrate.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.967
I-I think we've penetrated
all those frontiers.

01:35.804 --> 01:40.767
(indistinct chattering)

01:42.018 --> 01:44.938
-All right. Item nine, Big Bertha.
-OFFICER 1: Yeah.

01:45.021 --> 01:48.024
Our antiquated heating system
once more is kicking in

01:48.108 --> 01:51.778
-with a period of thermal hyperactivity.
-(all groaning)

01:51.861 --> 01:54.364
After knuckling under to an overnight
low of 16 degrees,

01:54.447 --> 01:59.536
Bertha continues to produce in excess
of 1.8 million BTUs per hour,

01:59.619 --> 02:04.040
despite every effort
by our crack janitorial squad

02:04.249 --> 02:06.751
-to get her to cool down.
-(all chuckling)

02:06.835 --> 02:11.339
-When you're hot, you're hot.
-(all groaning)

02:11.422 --> 02:13.675
It will please you to know that
a city-wide search is under way

02:13.758 --> 02:17.095
for a building engineer experienced
enough, i.e., old enough,

02:17.971 --> 02:20.306
to be familiar with the inner workings
of a furnace that,

02:20.390 --> 02:24.269
contrary to popular belief,
was not brought over in the<i> Mayflower,</i>

02:24.727 --> 02:27.480
but certainly predates
the Hoover administration.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.773
-(all chattering)
-OFFICER 2: Try the cemetery!

02:28.857 --> 02:31.234
In the meantime, let's keep
those upstairs windows open...

02:31.401 --> 02:32.485
-OFFICER 3: Yeah.
-OFFICER 4: Yeah.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.989
...and let's be certain to bundle up
properly before going outside.

02:37.282 --> 02:41.828
Item ten, illness continues to play havoc
with our duty roster.

02:42.704 --> 02:46.124
Revised pairings for the day.
Officers Hill and Crawford, foot patrol.

02:46.207 --> 02:49.210
Officers Nichols and Renko, Unit 2202.

02:49.294 --> 02:53.089
We can expect this fluid state of affairs
as regards duty assignments

02:53.464 --> 02:55.800
to continue throughout
the cold and flu season.

02:55.884 --> 02:56.718
(all groaning)

02:56.801 --> 03:02.348
Item 11, regards the ongoing canine
vicissitudes of Lamont.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.601
-(muffled howling)
-(laughter)

03:04.684 --> 03:08.980
Lhasa Apso, beloved of Trudy,
woman and wife to the governor.

03:09.731 --> 03:11.357
Officially, the dog continues missing.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.194
But it will hearten you to know
that even as I speak,

03:14.527 --> 03:17.197
a negotiated release
is being finalized upstairs,

03:17.280 --> 03:21.075
and the little nipper should be returned
safe and sound before day's end.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.995
-(officer 1 whistling)
-(cheering, applauding)

03:24.078 --> 03:25.830
Let us hope for this happy outcome.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.250
Let us hope for the well-being
of this little scamp.

03:29.918 --> 03:34.839
And more than anything, let us hope
for an end to the plague of dog hair

03:34.923 --> 03:38.801
that has assaulted our coffee,
our clothes, our sweet rolls,

03:38.885 --> 03:40.845
our nasal orifices

03:40.929 --> 03:44.474
over the intervening days via the various
Lamont pretenders.

03:45.266 --> 03:46.851
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.604
And let's be careful out there.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.524
Officer Hill, may I see you up here?

04:05.245 --> 04:09.290
You think, uh, young Crawford bought that
explanation of the new pairings?

04:09.707 --> 04:11.501
-Probably not.
-Hmm.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.170
Will you see what you can do to convince--

04:14.254 --> 04:15.505
-(banging)
-BOBBY: Hey!

04:18.800 --> 04:20.009
-(clanging)
-I'm gonna kill you, man!

04:20.093 --> 04:21.970
Hey, man! What the hell's wrong with you?

04:22.053 --> 04:23.388
(indistinct dialog)

04:23.471 --> 04:25.723
You guess you're straight, huh?

04:25.807 --> 04:28.309
-She bounce you off the walls, huh?
-All right. All right.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.644
Man, I don't know
what you're talkin' about!

04:29.727 --> 04:31.896
(yells) Teresa! Teresa!

04:31.980 --> 04:33.773
-I'm talkin' about Teresa!
-Renko!

04:33.856 --> 04:35.483
I'm talkin' about Teresa!

04:35.566 --> 04:37.777
-Hey, Renko! Hey! Stop it!
-PHIL: Renko!

04:37.860 --> 04:40.613
-Hey!
-PHIL: Stop it! Stop it!

04:41.906 --> 04:44.325
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:44.409 --> 04:46.160
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:46.244 --> 04:49.998
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:50.081 --> 04:51.666
(sirens wailing)

04:57.338 --> 05:01.050
(theme music playing)

06:06.366 --> 06:09.285
I will not tolerate such displays
in my station house.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.789
What you were fighting about
is personal business between you.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.708
There's no law says
you have to be friends.

06:16.459 --> 06:20.004
Either you keep your differences
off duty and off premises,

06:20.838 --> 06:23.800
or I'll have you reassigned. Understood?

06:27.553 --> 06:28.763
All right, dismissed.

06:31.849 --> 06:35.603
-(dog barking)
-(chattering)

06:38.981 --> 06:39.941
(sighs)

06:40.942 --> 06:43.069
-Woman troubles?
-I expect.

06:43.152 --> 06:46.739
Ah, the bachelor's life.
Hey, Phil, let's have lunch.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.492
Some other time, Ray.
I-I wouldn't be very good company.

06:49.575 --> 06:50.993
-LEO: Sarge!
-Excuse me.

06:55.873 --> 06:56.874
Come on, Phil.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.335
Let's put Grace Gardner
out of your mind, huh?

07:00.044 --> 07:02.922
We'll have a nice glass of wine,
enjoy a good meal.

07:03.506 --> 07:06.008
-Noon?
-12:30.

07:07.051 --> 07:08.302
-All right.
-Great!

07:14.308 --> 07:16.519
-FRANK: Hi, Irwin.
-Oh. Morning, Captain.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.729
-Listen, thanks for coming down.
-A little warm in here.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.273
-Well, we have a runaway furnace.
-Oh.

07:20.356 --> 07:22.984
Now, Irwin, I need a postponement
on the Edwards hearings.

07:23.067 --> 07:25.987
-With a little time, we could make a case.
-Uh...

07:29.574 --> 07:32.034
I can't do it, Frank. No postponements.

07:32.660 --> 07:35.997
Uh, I don't have reason one to keep
Edwards in custody an hour over the limit.

07:36.330 --> 07:39.083
-Then let's turn him loose for a few days.
-IRWIN: Still no.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.961
My office has decided
to go with what we've got.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.338
We're putting our faith
in Coroner Nydorf's testimony.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.382
Then we're dead, and you know it.

07:47.675 --> 07:48.926
IRWIN: Sorry you think that.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.763
What's going on, Irwin? I'm trying to keep
from losing a murder case.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.682
And you guys seem willing to let it go.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.647
We're gonna get him, Frank,
once and for all.

08:03.774 --> 08:05.276
-Nydorf.
-Damn right.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.362
-You're gonna let a murderer walk?
-IRWIN: We are?

08:10.031 --> 08:12.450
Who was it that lost
the damn autopsy report?

08:13.117 --> 08:16.537
And then who burned up the damn body
so he couldn't perform another one?

08:16.621 --> 08:19.123
If we postpone, m-maybe
we can-- we can get Edwards to plead

08:19.207 --> 08:20.583
and-- or we develop--

08:20.666 --> 08:23.753
Frank, our office has had egg on its face
'cause of this guy too many times,

08:23.836 --> 08:25.254
for too many years.

08:25.755 --> 08:29.383
Since I came on in '79,
I can quote you seven cases.

08:29.467 --> 08:30.885
FRANK: Then tell him to resign.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.971
What? And go through two more years
of civil service hearings?

08:34.430 --> 08:35.264
And in the meanwhile,

08:35.348 --> 08:38.893
how many more killers like Bubba Edwards
does he open the cell door on?

08:39.143 --> 08:43.314
No. No, Wally Nydorf
wants to testify, Frank.

08:43.606 --> 08:47.818
He thinks he can get his report to fly.
And we're gonna let him try.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.905
He's been that department for 32 years.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.241
That's nothing to brag about.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.870
(sighs) I'll see you in court.

09:01.457 --> 09:05.920
-(chattering)
-(telephone ringing)

09:13.553 --> 09:17.557
-Mick, I'm terrified.
-Eddie, your part of it is over.

09:17.765 --> 09:20.601
All you have to do is disappear
till around four o'clock.

09:20.685 --> 09:24.063
You know that all you can do is get
yourself made showing up here.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.566
Oops. Poorly put.

09:26.649 --> 09:27.858
I can't be alone.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.404
I keep thinking what I'm doing to Jose.
I'm getting him in trouble.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.407
What do you mean, getting him in trouble?
The guy killed three people!

09:34.490 --> 09:38.494
But I still-- I can't stand causing pain.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.663
-Mick--
-All right, you listen to me.

09:41.038 --> 09:42.331
You did the right thing.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.251
Now you gotta let me and the people
I work with do our jobs.

09:45.585 --> 09:49.005
But what's gonna happen to me?
What's going to happen to the betrayer?

09:49.088 --> 09:50.923
Nothing is gonna happen to you, Eddie!

09:56.971 --> 09:57.805
Go to the movies.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.684
I should. I was thinking I should.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.061
-Well, I think it's a good idea.
-And then...

10:05.438 --> 10:07.732
And after today,
I-I thought I'd go away for a while.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.568
If things go good,
we don't need more information,

10:10.651 --> 10:12.236
I think that's right on the ball.

10:16.699 --> 10:17.533
I cleaned your apartment.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.661
I think you had the cure for something
growing in your sink.

10:22.538 --> 10:24.915
-Thank you.
-EDDIE: And your mother called.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.793
-She's a doll.
-Go to the movies.

10:28.544 --> 10:29.587
See you later.

10:35.885 --> 10:38.888
(scoffs) You're immature.
You're promiscuous.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.350
You got a lousy attitude toward women.
You stay out all night long.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.976
Well, I'll kill myself tomorrow, okay?

10:44.060 --> 10:46.270
Oh, I mean,
putting it to a buddy's girl, Joe.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.481
-That is the lowest.
-Hey, you don't know all the facts, Luce!

10:48.564 --> 10:50.441
-So just knock it off!
-Well, fine. Why don't you tell me?

10:50.524 --> 10:51.734
You're not my mother, either!

10:51.817 --> 10:55.488
Oh, perfect, beautiful.
You're right.<i> "Perfecto"!</i>

10:56.781 --> 10:57.782
I can't believe you.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.534
-Well, maybe you want a new partner.
-(car door opens)

11:01.077 --> 11:03.996
-Maybe I do.
-Yeah, maybe Phil Donahue's available.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.630
-So. Any messages?
-Mmm.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.174
-What?
-(inaudible whispers)

11:22.348 --> 11:23.182
What do you want?

11:23.265 --> 11:25.559
I saw him comin' out of your house
last night. Joe Coffey.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.978
So what? Who I see is my own business.

11:28.062 --> 11:31.023
-You are trying to ruin this relationship.
-What relationship?

11:33.609 --> 11:35.903
We had some really nice times together.
We had a lot of fun.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.239
And some of the other times
were not so enjoyable.

11:38.989 --> 11:41.951
-What you did the other night--
-(yells) It's Joe Coffey, isn't it?

11:44.453 --> 11:45.287
If you say so.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.165
How could you do this?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.252
You're such a jerk.

11:54.213 --> 11:57.133
I want to tell you something,
not that it's any of your business.

11:59.593 --> 12:01.846
But nothing happened last night
between Joe and I.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.265
I wanted to, and he passed.

12:11.939 --> 12:15.651
-And no, it doesn't change anything.
-Look, couldn't we just...

12:16.861 --> 12:19.238
Maybe if I... changed.

12:22.032 --> 12:25.077
You're not gonna be happy
until you bulldoze yourself into nothing.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.463
I care for you so much.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.051
Just go, okay?

12:42.845 --> 12:46.056
Don't make me... sad I ever met you.

12:54.398 --> 12:56.734
(knocking on door)

12:57.485 --> 12:58.778
-Lee?
-MICK: Yeah.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.281
Right on the button,<i> amigo.</i>

13:02.364 --> 13:03.908
-How you doin', Sid?
-How are you doing?

13:03.991 --> 13:05.910
-I'm good. I'm good.
-Didn't have any trouble gettin' here?

13:05.993 --> 13:09.455
No. No sweat. The stuff in there?

13:09.538 --> 13:12.541
Hey, Lee, that is 14 polo shirts

13:12.625 --> 13:15.085
and a half a case
of coconut tanning butter.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.338
(chuckles) What're you doing?
You taking a trip?

13:17.421 --> 13:19.340
Uh-huh. And you wanna know
something crazy?

13:19.423 --> 13:20.925
-MICK: What?
-I don't even know where.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.469
-(Mick chuckles)
-I'm just gonna go out to the airport,

13:23.803 --> 13:25.262
and I'm gonna see what's flying.

13:25.721 --> 13:30.309
-I'm gone. Come on down!
-(both laugh)

13:30.392 --> 13:32.895
And, uh, what is it that I can do for you?

13:33.395 --> 13:36.440
Well, I think you can do
a couple of LBs for me.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.483
Mm-hmm.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.361
Well, I think I can cover your action.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.573
Now, listen, Lee.
I don't wanna cause any embarrassment,

13:44.657 --> 13:47.368
but, uh,
I'm gonna have to see your talent.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.912
Sidney, this is not an embarrassment.

13:56.293 --> 13:59.588
Peekaboo. Which I'm not gonna
count it or nothin', Lee.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.299
-I'm not gonna waste our time.
-MICK: Thank you very much.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.884
-You ready?
-MICK: I'm ready.

14:05.344 --> 14:10.683
-Ta-da. Ta-da.
-(chuckles)

14:11.517 --> 14:13.727
Check whichever one you want.
What do you use? Heat?

14:13.811 --> 14:17.314
What? Are you kidding?
I know you're not gonna stiff me, Sid.

14:17.857 --> 14:23.279
Absolutely. I'll tell you.
This is 100 percent Peruvian soda.

14:24.029 --> 14:27.700
I'm only moving it for a friend
who got caught in a couple of switches.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.828
You know, it's too bad
Teddy and Steve can't be here,

14:30.911 --> 14:32.496
-because we could, uh--
-(knocking on door)

14:32.788 --> 14:34.498
I think that can be arranged.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.003
SID: Teddy. Steve.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.504
-Neal.
-John.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.215
-Lee?
-Michael.

14:45.759 --> 14:46.594
I'm sick.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.430
I'm sick in my heart.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.693
-Frank.
-How're you doing, Wally?

15:04.028 --> 15:06.572
-All right. How 'bout yourself?
-Fine.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.659
Come down to give me the Rockne speech
before the big hearing, Frank?

15:10.743 --> 15:12.453
Oh. Well, I don't know what I'd think

15:12.536 --> 15:14.955
I could teach you about testifying
at a prelim.

15:15.039 --> 15:19.126
(chuckles) Yeah, I've been around that
block a couple of times.

15:19.752 --> 15:23.255
-FRANK: I'm looking for a favor.
-Oh, yeah? Sure.

15:24.256 --> 15:28.510
Our evidence on, uh, Bubba Edwards seems,
uh, iffy to me.

15:28.719 --> 15:31.305
I thought maybe you could develop
a 48-hour flu bug,

15:31.388 --> 15:33.641
and, uh, meantime
we could get him into plea.

15:33.807 --> 15:36.352
Plea to what? Felony bad looks?

15:36.685 --> 15:37.978
FRANK: Well, we've been going
through the records.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.648
We think we might be able to connect him
with some other business.

15:41.357 --> 15:44.693
-What other business?
-A couple of unsolved homicides.

15:45.486 --> 15:49.156
(chuckles) They why doesn't the DA
postpone on that, Frank?

15:49.907 --> 15:51.033
Why get me to stiff the hearing

15:51.116 --> 15:53.285
for something that takes
a phone call downtown?

15:54.161 --> 15:55.788
Stop yankin' my chain.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.334
It's a hanging party up there.
They're after you, Wally.

16:01.210 --> 16:05.381
Frank, you've always been a good kid.
And I appreciate your concern.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.132
But believe me, Frank,

16:07.466 --> 16:11.345
there isn't a trial lawyer around
I can't waltz through one of these things.

16:11.428 --> 16:13.555
I'm gonna get you your indictment, Frank.

16:14.431 --> 16:17.226
W-Wally, you're not seeing
the situation clearly.

16:18.602 --> 16:21.939
They want you out.
They want another chief coroner.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.024
Now, don't make me lose my temper, Frank.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.986
Wally, when I first came on the force,

16:27.069 --> 16:29.738
as much as anyone,
you showed me what it took to do my job.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.241
Don't give me a eulogy. Nobody's dead.

16:34.284 --> 16:38.372
This department is in bad enough
shape... without a public humiliation.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.417
Please, Wally. Take 48 hours.
Consider retirement.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.545
You wanna know when I'll retire?

16:46.171 --> 16:48.882
When I'm the guy out there on that slab.
That's when.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.887
Get out of here.

17:10.362 --> 17:13.824
You guys draw straws for who got me?
You lose?

17:15.701 --> 17:17.995
-You're being too sensitive, brother.
-Sure.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.164
Three partners in three days.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.292
Nate, stop thinking so much.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.254
-You see the tall guy across the street?
-Which one?

17:28.213 --> 17:30.924
He took a TV out of the Marquis
and put it in his own car.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.510
Had an extension cord
and a circuit tester in his back pocket.

17:33.594 --> 17:37.556
Maybe a repairman or... (chuckles)
the Einstein of the B&amp;E set.

17:41.727 --> 17:42.978
(car horn honks in distance)

17:46.065 --> 17:49.193
-Say, could we lend you a hand?
-Yes, please!

17:49.276 --> 17:50.319
Okay, get in the car.

17:52.613 --> 17:56.992
-You know, I was shot two years ago, Nate.
-You were?

17:58.118 --> 17:59.745
Going into one of those buildings.

18:00.621 --> 18:03.665
Every time I walk into a hallway,
I have to fight off the fear.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.211
Comes with the territory, man.

18:08.879 --> 18:12.007
-Try it!
-(engine starts)

18:13.926 --> 18:16.053
-MAN 1: That's good.
-Thanks, officers!

18:17.971 --> 18:18.847
NATE: You got it.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.976
-Phil. Ready for lunch?
-Oh? Yeah, all set.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.979
-Oh, thank you, Ray.
-You're quite welcome.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.232
Hey, look who is here!

18:29.608 --> 18:33.278
Well, that's Rosa... and somebody else.

18:33.362 --> 18:36.907
I think, uh...
that's her cousin, Esperanza.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.451
(in Spanish)<i> Hola, muchacha! ¿Cómo está?</i>

18:40.994 --> 18:44.540
Ray, it was my understanding that...
You and I, man to man.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.959
Oh, this Esperanza
is an exceptional woman.

18:47.042 --> 18:51.171
She's bright, intelligent,
hardworking and single!

18:51.255 --> 18:54.383
-Ray.
-Should we invite 'em for lunch?

18:56.343 --> 19:01.140
-Esperanza!<i> Qué coincidencia!</i>
-(speaking in Spanish)

19:03.517 --> 19:07.146
(speaking in Spanish)

19:07.229 --> 19:10.357
-"Felipe" Esterhaus.
-(speaking in Spanish)

19:10.440 --> 19:12.609
She says it's a great pleasure
to meet you.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.653
RAY: She really knows much more
English than she thinks.

19:14.736 --> 19:17.906
-ROSA: She just gets nervous.
-I'm pleased to meet you too, Esperanza.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.952
-(speaking in Spanish)
-(in Spanish)<i> Ay, gracias. </i>(chuckles)

19:22.035 --> 19:23.579
-Hi, Phil.
-Hello, Rosa.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.206
-W-Were the two of you shopping?
-Yes!

19:26.498 --> 19:28.208
Imagine the coincidence!

19:28.292 --> 19:30.002
ROSA:
We were just at the new mall, right there.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.588
-Mm-hmm. Imagine.
-RAY: Boy, am I hungry!

19:32.671 --> 19:33.630
ROSA: Oh, me too!

19:34.715 --> 19:38.552
(speaking in Spanish)

19:41.013 --> 19:42.723
(exhales) You guys.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.934
You really make me sick, you know that?

19:46.351 --> 19:47.311
So, what? Now what am I supposed to do?

19:47.394 --> 19:49.771
I'm supposed to lie down?
I'm supposed to roll over?

19:50.731 --> 19:53.025
-Forget about it.
-Jose.

19:53.775 --> 19:57.029
-Jose who?
-Come on, Sid. Jose.

19:57.112 --> 19:59.740
You know, the guy that shot
and barbecued three Peruvians?

20:00.616 --> 20:02.367
I don't know who you're talkin' about.

20:03.660 --> 20:06.788
Look, uh, one of you guys wanna check
the thermostat? It's like a oven in here.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.458
Man, you give him up, you could probably
walk away from the whole bust.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.629
Oh, I could walk away
if I rat on this guy?

20:14.421 --> 20:15.547
I'm gonna walk where?

20:16.423 --> 20:19.593
Relocation. Maybe a couple of bucks
in your pocket.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.221
Captain, these guys just whistlin'?

20:22.429 --> 20:25.599
Because I wouldn't believe these two
if they told me the sky was blue.

20:28.936 --> 20:29.770
The guy's got friends.

20:31.271 --> 20:35.234
Money and relocation are good,
but I'm gonna need more.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.653
I'm gonna need surgery.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.408
Take a couple of John Doe warrants
besides the one from Jose,

20:43.492 --> 20:45.202
-in case he needs company.
-Right.

20:46.745 --> 20:47.663
Movie's over.

20:48.705 --> 20:52.084
You are driving me crazy, you know that?
You're up here more than a bail bondsman!

20:52.167 --> 20:56.338
You! Butterfly! You did this?
It was you! Pig squealer!

20:56.421 --> 20:57.256
-Get him out of here!
-Come on!

20:57.339 --> 20:59.675
-Pig squealer!
-Oh, my God!

21:00.384 --> 21:03.887
You're dead, butterfly.
How does it feel to be dead, huh?

21:04.221 --> 21:06.890
I'm gettin' a nose job!
You're gettin' a pine box!

21:06.974 --> 21:08.183
(yells) Shut up!

21:09.184 --> 21:11.520
-So long, dead man!
-(grunts)

21:19.945 --> 21:22.906
-You happy?
-Oh, God! Oh, God!

21:22.990 --> 21:24.408
That's why I told you not to come up here.

21:24.491 --> 21:26.868
-I'm dead! I'm a dead man!
-All right. Just calm down.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.413
-Oh, I'm dead now. What have I done?
-Eddie! Stop it.

21:30.998 --> 21:31.999
Come here.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.627
I'm worthless. (hyperventilating)
I wish I didn't exist.

21:35.711 --> 21:40.507
Hey, stop it! You're staying here.
We're gonna take care of you.

21:41.174 --> 21:46.346
Nobody's gonna hurt you, Eddie.
You're with friends now. You hear me?

21:48.473 --> 21:49.349
Okay.

21:53.437 --> 21:57.316
Eddie, this is Sergeant Goldblume.
Sergeant Goldblume's gonna stay with you.

21:57.899 --> 21:58.942
How do you do?

22:02.821 --> 22:05.907
-Henry Goldblume.
-Eddie Gregg.

22:06.825 --> 22:09.619
-How do you do?
-(door closes)

22:10.829 --> 22:13.373
-You okay?
-Yeah.

22:14.875 --> 22:15.709
All right.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.004
(chattering)

22:19.087 --> 22:20.839
You could pick up those warrants
at 2:30, Mick.

22:20.922 --> 22:21.798
Thank you.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.217
(mimicking Eddie) I love you.

22:25.802 --> 22:28.305
-I love your hot breath.
-Excuse me?

22:28.597 --> 22:29.556
Excuse me.

22:31.141 --> 22:34.436
-Cut it out, hair bag!
-Oh, Mick. Mick, I'm damp.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.772
-My breast is heaving--
-(yells) I said, cut it out!

22:36.855 --> 22:38.815
-Hey, hey, calm down. Be cool, baby.
-My God!

22:39.441 --> 22:42.527
-Geez.
-MICK: You make me sick!

22:44.654 --> 22:47.449
Just 'cause a guy's different,
what the hell is it to you?

22:48.992 --> 22:50.869
What are you afraid of?
He's gonna come up to you

22:50.952 --> 22:52.537
and touch you and give it to you?

22:57.751 --> 23:00.087
Eddie Gregg is scared, that's all!

23:01.671 --> 23:05.467
He's just a poor, scared guy
trying to get through the day!

23:06.468 --> 23:07.302
(grunts)

23:15.560 --> 23:17.104
I was dumbfounded, Howard.

23:17.187 --> 23:19.398
I'm sure the man had the best
of intentions, Phil.

23:19.481 --> 23:20.565
Granted. Of course he did.

23:20.649 --> 23:23.026
But the fact remains
with the best intentions in the world,

23:23.110 --> 23:26.405
the man put me
in an extremely precarious spot.

23:27.239 --> 23:30.450
I felt like he had a license in his pocket
and a clergyman in the car.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.494
-Clergyman in the car?
-(scoffs)

23:32.911 --> 23:36.206
Phil has just survived an assault
on his bachelorhood, Henry.

23:36.289 --> 23:40.794
It seems that our Ramon Calletano is not
above a few Machiavellian machinations

23:40.877 --> 23:44.172
to procure citizenship
for a friend of the family.

23:44.631 --> 23:48.051
Did I understand you
to use the word procure, Howard?

23:50.762 --> 23:52.055
Calm yourself, amigo.

23:52.139 --> 23:56.268
I didn't use that term
in a "solicitorial" context.

23:56.685 --> 24:00.147
I am sorry your meeting with Esperanza
did not have a happy outcome.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.107
But it is not fair for you to accuse me--

24:02.190 --> 24:06.111
I'm not accusing you of anything.
It was just a very awkward situation.

24:06.611 --> 24:09.322
It is true Esperanza's visa
is running out.

24:09.656 --> 24:12.784
It is true we hoped something
might develop between the two of you.

24:13.535 --> 24:17.164
But only if you had both fallen in love
in the next eight days,

24:17.247 --> 24:18.957
we would have considered marriage.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.002
Stranger things have happened!

24:22.085 --> 24:24.463
-Well, not to me.
-GRACE: Excuse me.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.383
Hello, Howard.

24:29.342 --> 24:31.178
-Ray.
-HOWARD: Hello, Grace.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.304
RAY: Miss Gardner.

24:37.142 --> 24:40.187
Phil, could we have a private moment?

24:43.940 --> 24:45.400
If you gentlemen will excuse us.

24:46.234 --> 24:49.029
-Uh, you'll follow me, please?
-GRACE: Roll call?

24:54.910 --> 24:55.952
Any word on Lamont?

24:57.412 --> 24:59.539
Lots of sugar, just like you wanted.

25:04.252 --> 25:06.046
I was gone two minutes, Frank.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.508
-I went to get him some coffee.
-Where do you think he went?

25:10.217 --> 25:12.594
Probably to the bus station.
He was scared to death.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.139
What time are we busting the boyfriend?

25:16.515 --> 25:18.683
Uh, 45 minutes.

25:18.767 --> 25:21.144
He could be running back there
to warn him, you know.

25:21.436 --> 25:22.979
-We better notify Belker.
-Right.

25:26.691 --> 25:29.319
GRACE: It seems like
such a terrible waste.

25:30.153 --> 25:34.199
Well, still, if we break,
I feel we should break clean.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.326
And I appreciate that.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.412
If I were fair-minded I'd say, "I...

25:40.330 --> 25:45.085
"I have to give Phil emotional space
to develop new attachments.

25:46.586 --> 25:48.964
I have to respect his desire for...

25:49.965 --> 25:53.593
for a relationship
which has marriage as its goal."

25:53.677 --> 25:56.721
But, Phil, I'm not fair-minded.

25:57.430 --> 26:00.517
I still feel hot fire...

26:00.600 --> 26:03.603
burning inside me
every time I think of you.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.356
I smell your...

26:07.232 --> 26:12.112
your smell on my pillow
and-and on my clothes.

26:13.071 --> 26:17.033
Oh, I-I nearly go crazy wanting you.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.078
(gasps) Oh, Phil!

26:22.414 --> 26:23.248
(breathing heavily)

26:24.207 --> 26:28.920
There are still frontiers of passion
for us to penetrate.

26:29.004 --> 26:32.799
Grace, I-I think we've penetrated
all those frontiers...

26:32.882 --> 26:36.886
(laughs) No, we haven't.

26:42.726 --> 26:45.854
We haven't... begun.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.315
We haven't?

26:50.108 --> 26:54.446
No. And there's something
I want to do to you.

26:55.822 --> 26:58.908
-(inaudible whispers)
-Oh, ooh.

27:00.243 --> 27:02.078
Ooh, Grace.

27:02.787 --> 27:05.707
-Right here? Right now?
-Oh, you must know of a place.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.336
(breathing hard, moans)

27:12.922 --> 27:14.758
-The furnace room.
-Oh!

27:17.218 --> 27:18.178
Little ferret.

27:18.803 --> 27:21.389
Little wetback con artist.
He won't bring the dog back.

27:21.681 --> 27:24.643
-Jesus usually delivers.
-Well, it doesn't matter anyway.

27:24.726 --> 27:25.852
It couldn't matter less.

27:26.394 --> 27:28.355
You know what you're looking at?
You know what I am?

27:28.438 --> 27:31.149
<i>"Finito." </i>"Write-off-areeno."

27:31.775 --> 27:33.068
I figured it out last night.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.071
I don't get the dog,
I'm a failure. I do, I'm a joke.

27:36.696 --> 27:37.989
Every fund-raiser emcee,

27:38.073 --> 27:42.494
every smart-assed reporter
looking for a sidebar on a slow day.

27:42.577 --> 27:44.621
"Hey, let's work over Anderson.

27:45.121 --> 27:46.915
Let's do something on that stiff

27:46.998 --> 27:49.250
that spent 50 grand
finding the governor's dog."

27:49.501 --> 27:52.462
Oh, I'm out. I bought the farm.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.799
My career got creamed
by a runty little mutt.

27:58.593 --> 28:00.303
Why do you guys keep it so hot in here?

28:01.262 --> 28:05.308
(dog whining)

28:08.144 --> 28:10.146
Somebody lookin' for a dog?

28:14.901 --> 28:16.486
I don't believe it!

28:18.697 --> 28:20.657
-Is it really him?
-Check him out.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.369
(growls, barks)

28:24.953 --> 28:28.123
-MAN: Right dog this time, Mr. Anderson?
-Looks like the McCoy!

28:28.456 --> 28:30.375
Better get the governor's missus
down here.

28:32.043 --> 28:32.919
Lamont?

28:36.423 --> 28:39.092
I'm telling you, I'm looking forward
to getting back to the capitol.

28:39.175 --> 28:41.761
We've been here three days.
We were scheduled for four hours.

28:41.845 --> 28:44.389
(chuckles) I didn't even pack
an overnight bag.

28:44.931 --> 28:46.891
Martinez, with a "Z".

28:47.308 --> 28:50.520
Listen, pencil pusher,
you learn to spell that correctly.

28:50.812 --> 28:53.481
You're talking to the big cheese
of the new youth program.

28:53.565 --> 28:54.899
MAN: All right. M-A-R-T-I-N-E--

28:54.983 --> 28:56.776
-"Z" as in snake.
-MAN: "Z", got it.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.237
-You're a little lethargic.
-(whimpers)

28:59.320 --> 29:01.489
We'll get you on
a physical training program.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.199
We'll get you a shave and a haircut.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.077
You're hangin' around
with the wrong people, Lamont.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.163
Fetch. Fetch.

29:08.246 --> 29:09.372
-(whines)
-Fetch!

29:11.249 --> 29:13.418
-(barking)
-(car horns honking)

29:13.501 --> 29:16.129
(tires screeching)

29:20.300 --> 29:25.263
Dr. Nydorf, you've testified
that you've conducted autopsies

29:25.346 --> 29:28.141
-on more than 600 homicide victims.
-DR. NYDORF: That's right.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.270
You've, uh, supervised preparation
of autopsy reports.

29:32.353 --> 29:34.606
Over 7,000 other homicides.
That's correct.

29:35.523 --> 29:38.777
JOYCE: Doctor, what would you say
is the typical length of such a report?

29:39.527 --> 29:41.905
(chuckles)
Well, there's no typical length.

29:42.864 --> 29:47.035
Some reports go into great detail,
30 or 40 pages.

29:47.118 --> 29:47.952
Others-others--

29:48.036 --> 29:51.581
Would you put two and a half pages
on the low end of the scale?

29:52.582 --> 29:56.461
Do you want to weigh it?
It establishes cause of death.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.214
Doctor, when in time
was this report prepared

29:59.297 --> 30:01.549
relative to performance
of the autopsy itself?

30:01.633 --> 30:04.177
It's a reconstruction
of the original report.

30:04.260 --> 30:05.845
JOYCE: When in time was it prepared?

30:05.929 --> 30:07.847
Three weeks later.
That's all been stipulated.

30:08.139 --> 30:10.058
JOYCE: What happened
to the original autopsy, Doctor?

30:10.141 --> 30:13.937
That's all been stipulated.
The original report was misplaced.

30:14.521 --> 30:16.356
JOYCE: You're sure the autopsy was done?

30:20.568 --> 30:21.569
Oh, yes.

30:23.446 --> 30:26.157
Now, to the extent that
there is a customary procedure

30:26.241 --> 30:28.159
when an autopsy report is lost,

30:28.368 --> 30:30.662
in the case of a homicide,
what would that procedure be?

30:30.745 --> 30:33.581
Perform another autopsy.
Look, this has all been--

30:33.665 --> 30:35.875
Why wasn't that done in the present case?

30:36.209 --> 30:38.127
-The body was unavailable.
-JOYCE: Why?

30:39.337 --> 30:42.632
Look. This is a preliminary hearing.

30:43.216 --> 30:47.595
All he has to do is show reason to believe
a crime has been committed.

30:48.346 --> 30:50.515
Now, I have testified that the victim...

30:52.642 --> 30:57.313
Ca-- uh, uh... Castaneda,

30:57.897 --> 31:00.608
died from application of force
to the neck.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.652
JUDGE: Answer the question, please.

31:03.027 --> 31:06.447
Why wasn't the body available
for a second autopsy, Doctor?

31:09.492 --> 31:14.122
There were difficulties involved in,
uh, retrieval of the body.

31:14.747 --> 31:19.878
As you all know, as you all should know,
our office is understaffed and...

31:19.961 --> 31:22.005
Doctor, speak directly
to the question, please.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.423
DR. NYDORF: If you'd just let me ex--

31:23.506 --> 31:26.593
Why wasn't the body available
for a second autopsy, Doctor?

31:27.010 --> 31:30.263
I have said the body was not retrievable.

31:30.346 --> 31:32.765
-What prevented--
-The body had been cremated!

31:35.018 --> 31:40.982
Now, the, uh, body had been switched
with the body of a-- of a vagrant

31:41.065 --> 31:45.320
who died of natural causes,
and while we-- while we, uh,

31:45.403 --> 31:48.114
(stammers) we keep the body, we-we...

31:49.991 --> 31:53.620
We do not cremate the bodies
of homicide victims...

31:54.495 --> 31:58.833
to guard exac-- against exactly
this kind of eventuality.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.084
Now, in this particular situation--

32:00.168 --> 32:02.670
Doctor, isn't it true
that this report is worthless?

32:05.423 --> 32:06.466
That's argumentative.

32:06.549 --> 32:10.929
That it's a collage of unverifiable
recollections and borrowings

32:11.012 --> 32:12.013
from other documents?

32:12.096 --> 32:14.807
That's argumentative!
Bernstein, where the hell are you?

32:15.725 --> 32:17.060
Your Honor, with the court's permission,

32:17.143 --> 32:20.146
I'd like to reopen the question
of Dr. Nydorf's qualification...

32:20.229 --> 32:22.690
-to be admitted as an expert witness.
-What?

32:23.650 --> 32:25.777
-JUDGE: Objection?
-No objection, Your Honor.

32:32.367 --> 32:37.372
If I told you, Doctor,
that I have before me documentation

32:37.455 --> 32:40.792
of eleven instances
in just the last four years

32:40.875 --> 32:43.127
in which capital cases
have been dismissed...

32:43.503 --> 32:45.797
-Where did you get that?
-...in this county, on court holdings...

32:45.880 --> 32:47.090
-DR. NYDORF: Where did you get that?
-...that your office

32:47.173 --> 32:49.175
had provided inadequate information,

32:49.258 --> 32:50.885
or that it had not provided information
in timely fashion.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.846
-Where did you get that?
-Would that surprise you, Doctor?

32:56.933 --> 33:00.478
DR. NYDORF: Well, it's easy to see
who's really on trial here.

33:04.482 --> 33:08.903
Come on, everybody.
Get over on the prosecution side.

33:09.362 --> 33:10.363
JUDGE: Dr. Nydorf--

33:13.074 --> 33:14.617
This is a lynch mob.

33:16.828 --> 33:17.912
It's a hanging.

33:19.372 --> 33:22.500
And I've got people in my own
department tying the rope!

33:22.875 --> 33:23.710
Doctor--

33:25.837 --> 33:31.175
Alberto Lorenzo.
Alberto Lorenzo of Lisbon, Portugal,

33:31.884 --> 33:36.139
found dead in Waterloo Park,
July 15, 1957.

33:37.140 --> 33:42.562
Body all busted up.
Cause of death: acute hypothermia.

33:44.313 --> 33:45.523
Nobody could explain it.

33:45.773 --> 33:49.235
How he got there, how he froze to death
in the middle of summer.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.154
Nobody could explain it!

33:51.362 --> 33:53.906
They called experts
from all over the world!

33:54.490 --> 33:57.243
Even called in that hotshot forensic
from New York!

33:57.410 --> 34:00.997
He couldn't explain it!
Nobody could! Nobody!

34:01.080 --> 34:03.249
But me, I did! I did!

34:03.332 --> 34:08.629
Me! Wally Nydorf,
Assistant Coroner Wally Nydorf.

34:10.214 --> 34:14.177
I sat in that park for six hours...

34:16.471 --> 34:17.346
and I knew.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.894
(chuckles)

34:25.688 --> 34:30.777
America. Alberto Lorenzo...

34:32.320 --> 34:34.072
wanted to come to America.

34:36.032 --> 34:39.911
So he climbed inside the wheel well
of a commercial airliner

34:39.994 --> 34:41.579
at Lisbon Airport and hid.

34:44.415 --> 34:48.336
He died over the Atlantic...

34:49.212 --> 34:53.341
at 40,000 feet where the air temperature
is ten below zero.

34:56.010 --> 34:57.345
And when the plane landed...

35:01.599 --> 35:02.809
the wheels came down...

35:05.436 --> 35:07.063
and Alberto Lorenzo...

35:09.565 --> 35:10.775
dropped out of the sky.

35:13.569 --> 35:14.737
I figured it.

35:15.863 --> 35:20.451
I did... when nobody else could.

35:22.995 --> 35:26.374
Oh, I was good.

35:29.544 --> 35:31.045
I was the best in the business.

35:34.215 --> 35:35.716
No further questions, Your Honor.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.053
JUDGE: You may stand down, Doctor.

36:02.952 --> 36:06.789
Court reserves the judgment
on the showing of probable cause.

36:09.375 --> 36:10.918
72-hour rule, Your Honor.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.546
My client has to be charged
before 5:00 p.m.

36:14.213 --> 36:16.507
JUDGE:
Judgment will be issued by 5:00 p.m.

36:16.799 --> 36:18.342
-(gavel bangs)
-Court's adjourned.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.651
All right? Everybody got him?

36:35.735 --> 36:36.611
-All right.
-Yeah.

36:37.028 --> 36:40.615
This guy's wasted three people.
Also, there's a chance he's been warned.

36:40.698 --> 36:42.950
These things do not make
a promising combination,

36:43.034 --> 36:46.704
so you keep your eyes open
and don't be afraid to use your radios.

36:46.871 --> 36:50.708
-You and you, you come with me.
-Just let's get this over with.

36:51.918 --> 36:54.420
-(gun cocks)
-Police! Open up!

36:54.503 --> 36:59.258
-EDDIE: Mick! Help me!
-(growls)

37:04.639 --> 37:06.807
-Where is he?
-Gone. The window.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.392
-(car horn honks)
-Oh, Mick.

37:08.684 --> 37:10.269
-How long ago?
-Just now.

37:10.895 --> 37:13.231
This is Red Squad One.
Suspect just left by the window.

37:13.314 --> 37:15.733
Street teams watch the alley.
We're goin' up to the roof.

37:15.816 --> 37:16.901
You watch the room.

37:20.655 --> 37:21.864
-You okay?
-Okay.

37:28.704 --> 37:30.289
You think he could have made it
to the street?

37:30.373 --> 37:32.917
No, we would have seen him.
Check that door.

37:42.551 --> 37:43.386
Bobby.

38:01.904 --> 38:03.489
You go there, and I'll go this way.

38:03.698 --> 38:06.575
-Shouldn't we stick together?
-Not enough time.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.077
Just play it cautious.

38:09.161 --> 38:10.204
(metal clanks)

38:12.331 --> 38:14.542
(object rattling)

38:47.158 --> 38:50.536
Make a sound, and you're dead! Drop it.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.290
You're just what I needed, piggy.

38:55.207 --> 38:56.334
Now move to the door.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.544
Why? What're you gonna do?

38:59.712 --> 39:01.213
What do you think, stupid?

39:01.797 --> 39:05.384
You're gonna help me walk past
your buddies. Now move it!

39:12.683 --> 39:16.437
-No.
-You wanna die, pig?

39:17.355 --> 39:22.735
You wanna kill me? Kill me.
I'm not going out there with you.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.404
You crazy. Now move it!

39:25.946 --> 39:27.156
(groan)

39:27.239 --> 39:29.241
(both grunting)

39:29.325 --> 39:31.160
(chains rattling)

39:35.706 --> 39:37.666
-(groans)
-(grunts)

39:39.418 --> 39:42.922
(groaning)

39:45.091 --> 39:49.053
(panting)

39:50.346 --> 39:52.139
(woman speaking indistinctly on radio)

39:52.681 --> 39:55.059
Billy, you wanna give the precinct a call.
Tell 'em we're comin' in.

39:55.142 --> 39:55.976
Okay.

39:56.644 --> 40:00.481
(helicopter blades whirring)

40:00.564 --> 40:02.775
-Better get over to County.
-I'm all right.

40:03.025 --> 40:06.320
No you're not. Go get yourself fixed up.
The city will pay for it.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.157
Mick, I'm sorry.
I did a terrible thing. I know.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.576
I'm weak. I'm a slave to my emotions.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.454
Don't give me any garbage
about your emotions, hair bag!

40:15.538 --> 40:17.790
-People almost got killed here.
-You're right.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.376
I deserve the worst that can happen to me.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.587
I don't blame you if you never forgive me.

40:25.756 --> 40:28.259
-Do you forgive me?
-Don't run your act with me, Eddie.

40:28.342 --> 40:29.260
I'm sick of it.

40:30.052 --> 40:33.055
I went the extra yard with you,
and you betrayed me. That's all.

40:33.764 --> 40:35.057
Please don't hate me, Mick.

40:36.851 --> 40:40.646
I don't hate you, Eddie.
I was just hoping you'd surprise me.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.773
(groans)

40:46.277 --> 40:50.030
After you get fixed up,
I think you'd better leave town.

40:52.741 --> 40:54.118
My 30 pieces of silver.

40:58.330 --> 40:59.415
I thought I'd go south.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.709
I don't care where you go.

41:04.336 --> 41:06.297
I'll always think of you
as my friend, Mick.

41:07.256 --> 41:09.842
I'll always be grateful to you
for taking care of me.

41:10.885 --> 41:11.927
(chattering on radio)

41:23.856 --> 41:25.774
-(no audible dialog)
-Thank you.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.236
I heard what went down, Crawford.
Good work.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.738
-Thank you, sir.
-Welcome to the Hill.

41:30.821 --> 41:31.697
Thank you.

41:33.657 --> 41:35.201
You call me down here!

41:35.284 --> 41:37.828
You cruelly and deliberately
build my hopes!

41:37.912 --> 41:40.247
Now you tell me that
he's disappeared again!

41:40.331 --> 41:43.584
Uh, we're as distressed
as you are, Mrs. Sandler.

41:43.667 --> 41:47.254
No you aren't.
You aren't nearly as distressed!

41:47.338 --> 41:50.966
You aren't nearly as unhappy
as you're going to be!

41:51.050 --> 41:53.260
-Go break your leg.
-What?

41:54.053 --> 41:55.137
Go kill yourself.

41:55.721 --> 41:58.557
-He's--
-How dare you talk to me like that?

41:58.641 --> 41:59.600
You're fired!

41:59.683 --> 42:03.604
-(scoffs) I'm fired? I quit!
-Wait. Just wait. Let me see.

42:06.857 --> 42:09.235
Rotten luck, Anderson. Fortunes of war.

42:18.035 --> 42:20.371
(scoffs) Today's hero, yesterday's goat.

42:21.205 --> 42:23.958
Yes, sirree, it's up and down, up and down
on the Hill Street elevator.

42:24.041 --> 42:25.501
It's all right, Nate.

42:26.043 --> 42:28.045
It wasn't anything different
out there today.

42:28.587 --> 42:31.215
There wasn't a damn thing different
from down in the sewer.

42:31.715 --> 42:33.175
I was just as scared.

42:34.051 --> 42:36.845
Just as much being-- Man, I was blind!

42:36.929 --> 42:40.307
-Take it ea-- Take it easy, Nate.
-(panting)

42:40.391 --> 42:42.601
Do you wanna know what kind of hero I was?

42:43.644 --> 42:47.314
He had a gun on me!
He was using me to get clear!

42:48.607 --> 42:52.570
I didn't want the others to see it.
Cowardly Crawford strikes again!

42:53.487 --> 42:54.613
Man, I was so scared.

42:54.697 --> 42:58.200
I was willing to die rather than
go through any more of that.

42:59.577 --> 43:00.744
(breathing heavily)

43:00.828 --> 43:03.455
I don't think I'm cut out
to be a police officer.

43:05.332 --> 43:08.794
I'm gonna quit. (chuckles)

43:12.715 --> 43:13.841
That's up to you, Nate.

43:16.302 --> 43:21.390
But if you do, don't do it because
you think you're a coward.

43:22.266 --> 43:23.934
There's all kinds of bravery, brother,

43:24.018 --> 43:26.478
and-and you're showing me
a lot of it right now.

43:30.691 --> 43:34.236
I don't know. I just don't know.

43:37.656 --> 43:39.116
Nate, for whatever it's worth,

43:39.450 --> 43:42.745
I was glad it was you next to me
in that building.

43:44.872 --> 43:45.706
Damn glad.

43:54.840 --> 43:56.925
-RENKO: Joe!
-You wanna hit me, Renko?

43:57.009 --> 43:59.345
-Go ahead. Hit me.
-No. No, I don't. I...

44:00.387 --> 44:03.891
I want to tell you I'm sorry
about what happened. I'm stupid.

44:05.601 --> 44:07.936
I went and saw Teresa,
and she told me, you know,

44:09.229 --> 44:10.064
nothing happened.

44:13.150 --> 44:15.611
(sighs) Look, I don't know
what I was thinkin'.

44:16.362 --> 44:18.322
She was your lady. I was out of line.

44:18.656 --> 44:22.201
You went over there because
I was too hardheaded to realize

44:22.284 --> 44:23.994
that some woman don't want me no more.

44:25.621 --> 44:28.499
So, you got a free run at her now.

44:31.335 --> 44:33.170
What? Me and Teresa? No.

44:34.004 --> 44:36.423
I mean, Teresa's okay, but, uh...

44:38.008 --> 44:39.051
she's just not our type.

44:39.677 --> 44:40.803
You know, cops.

44:42.763 --> 44:44.932
Yeah. Yeah.

44:46.684 --> 44:50.229
Okay, um, you're right. Okay.

44:52.898 --> 44:53.899
Square.

44:57.695 --> 45:01.657
Joe. Why didn't you tell me
nothin' happened?

45:02.658 --> 45:04.535
Because it wasn't important, that's why.

45:04.785 --> 45:07.705
It wasn't important? I'm out there today
acting like a fishwife.

45:07.788 --> 45:11.417
Look, let's just forget about it.
I mean, it's over. Everything's cool now.

45:11.500 --> 45:13.836
You know that stuff I said
about changing partners?

45:14.420 --> 45:16.797
-I don't want to be with anybody but you.
-(scoffs)

45:17.840 --> 45:20.634
They got 50 cent draws tonight
at, uh, MacHenry's.

45:21.093 --> 45:24.972
What do you say we go lift a few
and fish and chip, huh?

45:27.766 --> 45:28.600
Yeah.

45:34.106 --> 45:37.067
Things got a little bit out of hand
in there, didn't they, Frank?

45:40.028 --> 45:41.822
Lost my cool a little bit, didn't I?

45:42.990 --> 45:46.243
I'll tell you. I appreciate you trying
to tell me what was up.

45:46.326 --> 45:48.078
You know, I-I appreciate that.

45:50.914 --> 45:55.085
Hey, Frank, these things happen.

45:57.504 --> 45:58.630
It's all political.

45:59.465 --> 46:03.051
A couple of young turks over there
in my department with the DA.

46:03.677 --> 46:06.889
Wally, this isn't business as usual,
and it's not politics.

46:08.348 --> 46:10.267
Why don't you do yourself
a favor and quit?

46:13.061 --> 46:15.189
You're misreading the situation, Frank.

46:16.190 --> 46:18.066
I promise you. This will all blow over.

46:19.568 --> 46:21.069
Hey, listen.
What are you doing for dinner?

46:21.153 --> 46:24.406
-You wanna have some chow or something?
-FRANK: I don't think so, Wally.

46:25.866 --> 46:28.368
-Don't want to be seen with me, do you?
-FRANK: That isn't it.

46:31.371 --> 46:32.206
Hey, Frank.

46:36.335 --> 46:40.380
They'll never get rid of me.
I'm a civil servant.

46:42.466 --> 46:45.594
It'll take years for 'em to get rid of me.

46:47.387 --> 46:49.431
I only got 19 months to retirement.

46:53.143 --> 46:54.478
You're a doctor, Wally.

46:56.855 --> 46:59.358
You were one of the most distinguished men
in your field.

46:59.900 --> 47:04.780
You're gonna hide now behind the skirts
of-of some bureaucratic regulations?

47:04.863 --> 47:07.074
Don't do that to yourself. Quit now.

47:14.456 --> 47:15.332
What would I do?

47:18.710 --> 47:20.754
Oh, hey, Frank. Listen.

47:24.216 --> 47:26.552
I'll go out to my cabin
up in the hills there.

47:27.636 --> 47:30.347
A couple of weeks and... you'll see.

47:30.430 --> 47:34.101
When I come back,
no one will even remember this...

47:35.769 --> 47:38.063
Bubba Castaneda. (scoffs)

47:39.064 --> 47:40.858
No one will even remember his name.

47:51.451 --> 47:52.369
Listen, Frank.

47:56.415 --> 47:57.708
You take care of yourself.

48:01.378 --> 48:02.504
Don't work too hard.

48:12.139 --> 48:16.226
(mechanical rattling)

48:18.729 --> 48:21.273
Old Bertha just shut herself down,
Captain.

48:32.200 --> 48:36.330
(closing theme playing)
