WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:00.793
_

00:04.632 --> 00:08.320
Harry! One day, your
luck is going to run out.

00:08.355 --> 00:09.312
I'm not lucky.

00:09.347 --> 00:11.563
Wait. Where did you get that?

00:11.626 --> 00:12.860
Same as you, I imagine.

00:12.939 --> 00:15.565
Though, you don't seem to be
having half as much fun as I am.

00:15.646 --> 00:17.157
Did you know there was another bracelet?

00:17.192 --> 00:18.309
- Did you know that?
- No.

00:18.355 --> 00:19.892
About the mysterious Isabella?

00:19.947 --> 00:23.847
When you were given your bracelet,
you got a warning, I imagine.

00:23.882 --> 00:25.038
Something like that, yeah.

00:25.111 --> 00:26.111
It's drivel.

00:29.888 --> 00:31.680
I can't believe it missed you.

00:33.663 --> 00:35.681
Steve won't be running anything.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.596
He didn't follow protocol, and
as a result, he's been reduced to

00:38.631 --> 00:42.207
the rank of Detective
Constable with immediate effect.

00:42.262 --> 00:43.351
It was Anna, sir.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.740
I heard you stopped mid-sentence
like you'd seen a ghost

00:45.775 --> 00:47.049
and then you just ran out.

00:47.124 --> 00:48.819
I thought I saw Golding.

00:49.545 --> 00:51.708
I want to know what else it can do.

00:51.787 --> 00:53.227
I want to know everything.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:10.839 --> 01:14.135
"Kevin Jones-Okeyale."
I like the sound of that.

01:14.170 --> 01:17.071
Jones-Okeyale?
Okeyale-Jones.

01:17.125 --> 01:17.978
Are you kidding me?

01:18.017 --> 01:21.107
West-Kardashian. I rest my case.

01:59.884 --> 02:01.555
God, yes, another 11!

02:03.060 --> 02:05.118
Harry, come on, join me.

02:05.153 --> 02:07.582
I thought you were going to show
me something I don't know how to do.

02:07.617 --> 02:09.589
- Ugh.
- I've seen that movie.

02:09.667 --> 02:11.945
Luck isn't just about winning, you know.

02:12.018 --> 02:14.548
Oh, really? Bore me with what it is about.

02:19.367 --> 02:21.322
Fortune's a river.

02:21.357 --> 02:23.254
You don't try to control it,

02:23.320 --> 02:26.607
you just allow yourself to be swept along.

02:26.729 --> 02:28.322
Until you understand that,

02:28.385 --> 02:30.712
you'll never be able
to control the bracelet

02:30.772 --> 02:33.989
and that's when bad things happen, Harry.

02:34.054 --> 02:36.516
What's the point of having
it if I can't control it?

02:36.551 --> 02:38.548
I can't use it to do good.

02:48.186 --> 02:48.913
Suri?

02:48.983 --> 02:51.975
<i>Harry, where are you? There's been
a serious assault in Vauxhall.</i>

02:52.025 --> 02:53.305
I'm on my way.

02:54.930 --> 02:57.487
Harry! Harry...

03:28.060 --> 03:29.287
Yeah.

03:29.342 --> 03:31.473
God, you still stink of alcohol.

03:31.536 --> 03:34.662
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Then you won't need a mint.

03:34.725 --> 03:36.699
- Thanks.
- Take two.

03:36.770 --> 03:39.584
So this is DC Okeyale's partner?

03:39.619 --> 03:41.575
- His fiance.
- Alright.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.380
Whatever you need, just ask.

03:46.721 --> 03:50.195
So what's so special about this
chap that they got me out of bed?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.475
Heir to the Empire?

03:51.510 --> 03:54.848
He's the fiance of one of
the officers from our station.

03:55.519 --> 03:58.351
Oh, sorry. How's she taking it?

03:58.386 --> 04:01.239
Uh, time is a factor here, Ralph.

04:01.274 --> 04:03.955
Right, of course. Single blow to the head.

04:03.990 --> 04:07.820
Uh, the attacker was strong,
potentially right-handed,

04:07.872 --> 04:10.462
tall, probably male.

04:11.312 --> 04:15.677
We couldn't get any prints off
the handle, but it's been used.

04:15.712 --> 04:16.992
There'll be DNA.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.899
What's that on the
shoulder? Is that a bruise?

04:20.935 --> 04:22.530
Could he have fought back?

04:22.593 --> 04:24.078
I don't think it's a bruise.

04:24.358 --> 04:25.835
It's a tattoo.

04:26.017 --> 04:28.600
It's been removed... badly.

04:29.332 --> 04:30.224
Wham!

04:30.259 --> 04:32.984
No, I don't think he had time
to struggle and get a bruise.

04:33.034 --> 04:34.959
Is it consistent with a hate crime?

04:35.110 --> 04:37.190
Yes, but I thought you said he was...

04:38.881 --> 04:40.898
Oh. Ah, right.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.320
What about me, then, Suri?

04:44.430 --> 04:46.351
Collect CCTV in here and from traffic.

04:46.393 --> 04:47.820
Log every face and every car.

04:47.862 --> 04:48.750
Come on!

04:48.785 --> 04:50.155
_

04:50.218 --> 04:53.439
Are you enjoying this? Punishing me?

04:53.517 --> 04:56.317
You don't get it, do you?
This isn't about punishment.

04:56.352 --> 05:00.338
You need to prove to us you can
be trusted. Now get the CCTV.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.640
Jesus will forgive you!

05:14.773 --> 05:18.315
Listen, Ade, why do you think
Kevin left the club alone?

05:18.396 --> 05:20.886
I've asked myself that 1000 times.

05:21.565 --> 05:23.275
Sorry to do this, but...

05:23.551 --> 05:25.252
Do you think he could have been...

05:25.456 --> 05:27.271
- Meeting someone?
- Yeah.

05:27.358 --> 05:30.847
Guv, he wasn't that guy. He wasn't.

05:31.844 --> 05:34.149
- Had he fallen out with anyone?
- No.

05:34.391 --> 05:36.675
There was that stabbing last month in Soho.

05:36.710 --> 05:39.639
They never caught them. And
that acid attack around here.

05:39.727 --> 05:42.689
Guv, this is a straight-up hate crime.

05:42.751 --> 05:45.195
I could put a list together
of the usual scum myself.

05:45.230 --> 05:46.348
No, we're prelimming already.

05:46.383 --> 05:48.691
Ade, we'll look into everything. Stay here.

05:49.999 --> 05:52.971
- Our friend is dead!
- The wages of sin are death!

05:53.006 --> 05:55.282
Bitch, I've had just about
enough that I can take all of you!

05:55.348 --> 05:59.170
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey,
hey! Honour your friend peacefully.

05:59.268 --> 06:00.590
OK, if I just say, move away.

06:00.625 --> 06:04.188
As Reverend Huxley says, as
they sow, so shall they reap!

06:04.225 --> 06:06.557
Alright. Listen, love, one more word out
of you, I'll nick you myself, all right?

06:06.614 --> 06:09.293
Why are you protecting
these filthy sodomites?

06:09.355 --> 06:11.149
Right, mate, that's it.
Come on, you go in the tank.

06:14.347 --> 06:16.179
Oi. Oi. Bring him as well. Him!

06:17.145 --> 06:18.225
Jesus.

06:19.375 --> 06:21.181
Who have you arrested, the Salvation Army?

06:21.229 --> 06:23.595
You don't want to know. What you got?

06:23.706 --> 06:28.709
Sean Blake, caught loitering
outside Vauxhall Station on CCTV.

06:28.744 --> 06:30.263
Previous for hate crime.

06:30.328 --> 06:34.086
He's done time for trying to glass
a copper at a Britain First rally.

06:34.188 --> 06:36.086
We actually arrested him
eight months ago for assaulting

06:36.135 --> 06:40.210
a rival drug dealer in the
area, but he got off in court.

06:40.271 --> 06:42.111
Bring him in.

06:42.204 --> 06:43.444
Sure thing.

07:16.636 --> 07:18.561
Couldn't you just text like everyone else?

07:18.631 --> 07:20.591
Stay away from Harry Clayton.

07:25.088 --> 07:26.326
I mean it.

07:26.470 --> 07:29.790
Using the bracelet has
consequences. You should know that.

07:33.452 --> 07:36.080
I know all about consequences.

07:36.174 --> 07:39.441
You were happy enough for Harry to use
the bracelet when it suited your purposes,

07:39.522 --> 07:40.803
weren't you?

07:40.967 --> 07:42.692
I'm not the one lying to Harry.

07:44.559 --> 07:47.395
All you've done is lie, Eve.

07:47.593 --> 07:48.638
To me.

07:49.723 --> 07:51.251
To Harry.

07:51.387 --> 07:53.879
Does he know you put this on my wrist?

07:55.132 --> 07:57.394
He doesn't, does he?

07:59.289 --> 08:00.837
Shall we go tell him?

08:01.878 --> 08:03.198
Shall we?

08:04.566 --> 08:05.646
Don't.

08:06.783 --> 08:12.160
Does he know the pain you've
caused? The deaths on your hands?

08:12.239 --> 08:16.370
I warned you, and you wouldn't listen.

08:17.510 --> 08:19.736
You destroyed my life.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.606
I won't let you destroy his.

08:25.139 --> 08:26.556
Leave us alone.

08:32.469 --> 08:34.649
Would you mind telling me what
you were doing between the hours of

08:34.712 --> 08:37.452
1 and 3am the night before last?

08:38.369 --> 08:40.196
I was ministering to lost souls.

08:40.231 --> 08:42.850
We need you to be a bit more specific.

08:42.951 --> 08:47.551
I was giving soup and sandwiches
to the homeless at Vauxhall Station.

08:47.637 --> 08:50.461
And can anyone vouch for that?

08:50.496 --> 08:52.518
A man whose word is beyond doubt.

08:53.270 --> 08:55.075
Reverend Huxley.

08:55.209 --> 08:59.295
Huxley? That's the second time
I've heard that name today.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.855
The Reverend led me out of
a life of violence and drugs.

09:01.919 --> 09:03.639
Is flower arranging your thing?

09:07.791 --> 09:09.115
You don't mock a holy man.

09:09.181 --> 09:11.812
Verily, I say unto thee.

09:12.491 --> 09:16.015
The Reverend has a vision...
redemption for this city.

09:17.048 --> 09:18.326
A new dawn.

09:19.567 --> 09:23.268
You know who I blame for the
collapse of family values?

09:24.382 --> 09:26.315
Not the homosexuals

09:26.646 --> 09:30.583
or the bleeding-heart
liberals who pander to them.

09:30.645 --> 09:32.461
I blame the Christians.

09:32.563 --> 09:36.616
Yes, us. I blame us.

09:36.686 --> 09:39.571
We have apologised for
what is written in the Bible

09:39.642 --> 09:44.377
and the book could not be more
clear. Man shall not lie with man.

09:44.412 --> 09:47.890
It is abomination. Say it. It is...

09:47.958 --> 09:50.386
Abomination!

09:50.456 --> 09:54.849
Those who rebel against the
true path will be annihilated

09:54.888 --> 09:58.315
- at the day of judgment, for they are...
- Abomination!

09:58.369 --> 10:02.435
These are our streets,
and we're taking them back!

10:12.094 --> 10:13.698
He's got his own army.

10:15.259 --> 10:18.433
Sean Blake, a man with
a history of violence,

10:18.500 --> 10:22.908
claims to have been with you
and members of your... church

10:22.967 --> 10:25.926
between 1am and 3am two
nights ago. Is that true?

10:26.020 --> 10:30.008
Well, Detective Inspector,
I am proud to vouch for Sean.

10:30.071 --> 10:32.401
Sean has put violence behind him.

10:32.464 --> 10:35.145
We've all turned our backs on sin.

10:35.180 --> 10:38.345
The tragedy is that young
man did not do the same.

10:38.410 --> 10:41.127
The tragedy is that he was
the victim of a hate crime.

10:41.188 --> 10:45.480
Every weekend, young men are pulled
out of those clubs on stretchers,

10:45.566 --> 10:47.776
veins full of street drugs,
hearts full of despair.

10:47.847 --> 10:50.092
What are you doing about that?

10:50.182 --> 10:53.578
We're here to lead the
lost out of the wilderness.

10:55.672 --> 11:00.479
And if you don't mind me saying
so, Detective Inspector Harry,

11:00.544 --> 11:01.840
you look like one of the lost

11:01.881 --> 11:05.299
with your tired eyes and
that haunted expression.

11:05.782 --> 11:09.122
How are you filling the
God-shaped hole in your soul?

11:10.338 --> 11:12.985
Drink? Women?

11:13.215 --> 11:14.415
Gambling?

11:15.130 --> 11:20.584
Ah! So, you spent your
nights at the tables.

11:20.693 --> 11:23.824
That's the devil's pact you've
made to give you succour.

11:23.887 --> 11:27.030
If we find evidence that incriminates
Sean Blake in Kevin Jones' death,

11:27.065 --> 11:28.512
it will implicate you in murder.

11:28.562 --> 11:31.927
Ooh! I can see I've touched a nerve.

11:32.340 --> 11:34.678
You won't find a solution
to your self-loathing

11:34.744 --> 11:36.767
in the roll of a dice, Harry.

11:37.353 --> 11:40.506
Only God can bring sunlight into your soul.

11:41.820 --> 11:43.662
Men like him are the reason I left home.

11:43.697 --> 11:45.862
God, I'd love to nail that bastard.

11:46.488 --> 11:48.460
We're here if you need us, Harry.

11:48.538 --> 11:50.265
We don't shoot the wounded.

11:50.336 --> 11:54.260
The solution to your pain is not at
the roulette table, Inspector Harry.

12:05.973 --> 12:07.835
Did you know Kevin Jones?

12:08.612 --> 12:11.029
The dead man? No.

12:13.646 --> 12:16.082
He had a tattoo of that cross on his arm.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.625
Shame he didn't live by it.

12:19.691 --> 12:21.220
He might not be dead now.

12:30.228 --> 12:33.680
- Sex Discrimination Act?
- 1975.

12:33.751 --> 12:36.081
And then what were the
implications for working women?

12:36.159 --> 12:39.305
I don't have to know what it did,
I just have to know when it was.

12:39.395 --> 12:41.366
I despair of that school.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.242
- Bye.
- Go and teach these people something.

13:17.850 --> 13:19.102
Where has she gone?

13:21.988 --> 13:23.348
She was right here.

13:26.420 --> 13:28.589
You've been following me for
the last 20 minutes. Who are you?

13:28.649 --> 13:30.947
- You blinded me!
- Right, I'm calling the police.

13:31.020 --> 13:33.135
- We are the police.
- What?

13:36.730 --> 13:37.638
How long is he going to be?

13:37.673 --> 13:39.838
Someone's on their way, Mrs. Clayton.

13:40.109 --> 13:42.274
- You looking for Harry?
- Yes.

13:42.380 --> 13:45.556
I wanted to ask him why I've
been put under police protection.

13:45.629 --> 13:47.949
It's all right, I'll take her down. Thanks.

13:53.193 --> 13:54.852
Just tell me, is it Golding?

13:56.646 --> 14:00.500
We've had an unconfirmed
sighting of him in London.

14:02.081 --> 14:02.715
Right.

14:02.789 --> 14:05.058
Harry asked us to put
a watch on you and Daisy

14:05.093 --> 14:06.865
until we knew either way.

14:06.900 --> 14:08.544
- And do you?
- We're still investigating.

14:08.594 --> 14:12.465
It's probably not him.
Harry just didn't want us...

14:13.738 --> 14:15.258
...scare you.

14:15.482 --> 14:17.354
Well, it'd be hard to scare
the woman that got the better of

14:17.447 --> 14:18.649
two undercover police officers

14:18.731 --> 14:21.641
and put one in A&E. Very impressive.

14:21.719 --> 14:24.941
- You're the talk of the station.
- Yes, aren't I a genius?

14:28.624 --> 14:29.621
You should have told me.

14:29.656 --> 14:31.302
I thought you'd been through enough.

14:35.005 --> 14:36.215
OK?

14:37.116 --> 14:38.236
Of course.

15:00.020 --> 15:02.585
Anna, I was wondering
if I could have a word.

15:02.679 --> 15:06.225
Gala at the reform club is
next week and I wondered...

15:06.293 --> 15:07.789
If I'm out of line, then I apologise,

15:07.870 --> 15:11.711
but I wondered if you
might like to go together.

15:11.746 --> 15:13.066
As a date.

15:14.825 --> 15:16.127
Excuse me.

15:17.262 --> 15:18.735
Or not.

15:46.753 --> 15:47.814
What?

15:49.689 --> 15:50.929
No...

15:57.768 --> 15:59.248
Oh, come on!

16:00.066 --> 16:02.028
Oh, bad luck.

16:13.122 --> 16:15.557
It's getting late. I should go.

16:15.791 --> 16:18.470
We have just arrived.

16:18.556 --> 16:20.332
I have a murderer to catch.

16:20.393 --> 16:24.157
It's Huxley. Let someone else do it.

16:24.227 --> 16:28.345
They don't know what I'd do.
He says he can see into my soul.

16:28.380 --> 16:30.818
Well, I've seen into his. It's rotten.

16:30.873 --> 16:33.275
What does he claim to see in yours?

16:35.535 --> 16:37.460
I have to go.

16:37.572 --> 16:39.921
So you solve this case, then another one,

16:40.010 --> 16:42.905
then another one and
another one, and then what?

16:43.740 --> 16:46.665
The world is full of bad people.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.997
Are you going to spend your
whole life chasing them all?

16:50.821 --> 16:52.506
It's what I do.

16:52.819 --> 16:56.425
Work is dull. People are dull.

16:56.993 --> 16:58.360
You and I are different.

16:58.429 --> 17:00.799
We can step out into this
night and anything can happen,

17:00.834 --> 17:02.262
and always in our favour.

17:02.297 --> 17:04.577
This thing's not a toy to be played with.

17:04.688 --> 17:06.544
No-one's luck lasts forever.

17:07.462 --> 17:12.027
So speaks the gambler who loves
to lose as much as he loves to win.

17:12.108 --> 17:15.233
- I'm not that person anymore.
- No, exactly, you're not.

17:15.269 --> 17:17.500
Pain, trouble disaster, injury...

17:17.588 --> 17:19.977
they have no dominion over us.

17:20.074 --> 17:24.060
Ours is a life of continual good fortune.

17:24.121 --> 17:26.204
You can't know that. Not for sure.

17:26.259 --> 17:28.571
Oh. Jesus, Harry.

17:28.608 --> 17:31.316
How much proof do you need?

17:41.076 --> 17:42.105
Isabella?

17:42.168 --> 17:45.681
Forget racetracks, casinos...

17:45.769 --> 17:47.453
Isabella, get down.

17:47.540 --> 17:49.363
- We can win at life...
- Please.

17:49.441 --> 17:52.291
...over and over and over again.

17:52.356 --> 17:53.898
Get down from there.

17:53.974 --> 17:57.299
- You've had your share of bad luck.
- Stop it.

17:57.334 --> 17:59.620
- And so have I.
- Isabella.

17:59.691 --> 18:03.629
Now nothing need go wrong
for either of us ever again.

18:03.698 --> 18:05.584
Come away from the edge, please.

18:06.959 --> 18:08.209
Come get me.

18:09.429 --> 18:10.705
Isabella?

18:14.580 --> 18:16.166
Don't you get it, Harry?

18:18.924 --> 18:20.825
We're invincible.

18:21.170 --> 18:23.424
Whoo!

18:37.228 --> 18:38.305
You really think this preacher

18:38.383 --> 18:40.647
could have something to do
with Kevin Jones' murder?

18:40.717 --> 18:42.567
Well, he's lying about not
knowing him, I'm certain.

18:42.630 --> 18:44.368
Yeah, but that doesn't make him a murderer.

18:44.415 --> 18:45.785
You said he's got an alibi.

18:45.873 --> 18:49.519
Well, he could have organised it
and provided an alibi for the killer.

18:49.613 --> 18:50.878
So, what, one of his congregation?

18:50.917 --> 18:52.385
You haven't seen his congregation.

18:52.436 --> 18:54.560
It's not as implausible as it sounds, sir.

18:54.622 --> 18:56.585
His sermon was straight
out of the Old Testament...

18:56.620 --> 19:00.341
man shall not lie with
man, abomination, hellfire.

19:00.418 --> 19:01.578
I hate that shit.

19:04.108 --> 19:07.349
What do you know about this
Huxley guy? Where's he from?

19:08.231 --> 19:10.803
He set up the church five years ago,

19:10.966 --> 19:14.385
split from the evangelical
movement for being too radical.

19:14.552 --> 19:16.984
Before that, he was a psychiatrist.

19:17.067 --> 19:19.476
Taught at several London hospitals.

19:19.555 --> 19:20.985
He was struck off.

19:21.129 --> 19:22.724
Really? Why?

19:22.794 --> 19:24.665
There was a nondisclosure agreement.

19:25.067 --> 19:27.145
I don't know if it was to
protect him or the hospital.

19:27.180 --> 19:29.530
Well, I'd like to know what he's hiding.

19:29.616 --> 19:32.182
What's that got to do with the
murder? No, leave that for now.

19:32.217 --> 19:35.888
Just come back with something
more concrete. Steve?

19:39.577 --> 19:42.025
We need to get a copy of
Huxley's disciplinary hearing.

19:42.095 --> 19:44.753
You mean the one our boss
specifically told us to leave?

19:44.808 --> 19:47.211
- Exactly. You're getting better.
- Yeah.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.998
- All the best. Night, Glenda.
- Bye, Rev.

19:52.220 --> 19:54.226
Powerful message, Reverend.

19:56.279 --> 19:59.432
- Ah... Safe home. Thanks for coming.
- Thank you so much.

20:25.407 --> 20:27.604
How is this a hate crime?

20:27.706 --> 20:29.827
Well, is it the same killer?

20:29.862 --> 20:31.523
It's too early to tell.

20:31.610 --> 20:33.890
The murder weapon's from the same brand.

20:39.010 --> 20:41.280
Huxley has an alibi.

20:41.357 --> 20:44.082
You need to open out
the investigation, Harry.

20:44.443 --> 20:45.989
I don't think I've got the wrong guy.

20:46.062 --> 20:48.041
If the victims are unconnected,

20:48.127 --> 20:50.173
we could have a serial killer on our hands.

20:50.227 --> 20:51.083
They <i>are</i> connected.

20:51.131 --> 20:53.336
Kevin Jones had a tattoo
of that cross on his arm.

20:53.402 --> 20:55.827
I think Huxley lied when
he said he didn't know him.

20:56.231 --> 20:57.812
Huxley's involved.

20:57.858 --> 20:59.435
I can feel it.

20:59.478 --> 21:02.203
You and I both know that half
of all policing is instinct.

21:02.258 --> 21:03.852
You get a feel for a case.

21:03.944 --> 21:06.708
Instinct won't bring Ade justice.

21:07.334 --> 21:09.334
Open up the investigation.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.452
Follow the evidence.

21:15.187 --> 21:17.815
You're letting prejudice
cloud your judgment.

21:17.951 --> 21:19.837
Talk to the husband, Harry.

21:21.899 --> 21:22.961
We argued.

21:24.135 --> 21:26.352
Last thing I did was shout at her.

21:26.387 --> 21:27.064
Why?

21:27.127 --> 21:30.732
I was sick of her spending all
her time with her... church.

21:30.908 --> 21:33.148
There are worse places to spend your time.

21:36.030 --> 21:38.759
Huxley had some kind of hold over her.

21:40.113 --> 21:42.450
She thought he was God or something.

21:43.778 --> 21:46.810
And I didn't like the
people that went there.

21:46.927 --> 21:49.370
Attracted all sorts.

21:49.467 --> 21:52.299
Do you have any objection to
us taking a sample of your DNA

21:52.359 --> 21:54.673
so we can rule you out of our enquiries?

21:55.410 --> 21:56.935
No, of course not.

21:56.970 --> 21:59.438
And we need to ask you
where you were this evening.

22:00.261 --> 22:02.547
At home with the kids.

22:04.565 --> 22:05.899
Oh, God.

22:07.268 --> 22:08.668
What am I going to say to them?

22:15.780 --> 22:18.093
<i>And if you don't mind me saying so,</i>

22:18.164 --> 22:21.928
<i>Detective Inspector Harry,
you look like one of the lost,</i>

22:21.985 --> 22:25.545
<i>with your tired eyes and
that haunted expression.</i>

22:26.003 --> 22:29.584
<i>How are you filling the
God-shaped hole in your soul?</i>

22:30.040 --> 22:31.244
<i>Gambling?</i>

22:31.767 --> 22:33.588
I thought it was Huxley, too.

22:34.631 --> 22:35.930
Are you sure it's not?

22:36.497 --> 22:39.234
It might not be a hate crime,
but he knew both victims.

22:39.304 --> 22:40.810
We don't know that for sure.

22:40.884 --> 22:41.995
And why kill Melanie?

22:42.030 --> 22:43.513
She was his biggest fan.

22:44.019 --> 22:46.612
Maybe she caught him with his
hand in the collection tin?

22:46.694 --> 22:48.059
Maybe they were having an affair?

22:48.165 --> 22:50.010
That's weak, Harry. You've got nothing.

22:50.146 --> 22:52.172
You're letting Huxley get under your skin.

23:12.805 --> 23:13.638
Suri?

23:13.722 --> 23:15.896
<i>You're meant to be at
Melanie Spencer's postmortem.</i>

23:15.977 --> 23:17.142
<i>Winter's here.</i>

23:17.324 --> 23:19.188
Oh, bollocks!

23:19.805 --> 23:20.799
Why's Winter here?

23:20.856 --> 23:23.181
- I lied. I thought it might hurry you up.
- What?

23:23.216 --> 23:26.061
We're three days into a double
murder, and we don't have any leads.

23:26.096 --> 23:27.341
We've Huxley.

23:27.415 --> 23:29.580
Like I said, we don't have any leads.

23:29.770 --> 23:32.570
You don't need me to tell you
this was a frenzied attack.

23:32.661 --> 23:35.610
- Multiple blunt force head injuries.
- Mm-hm.

23:35.645 --> 23:40.040
But no defensive injuries in either case...

23:41.965 --> 23:45.685
...which sometimes indicates that
the victim was known to the killer.

23:47.390 --> 23:49.902
You see? Not expecting
an assault from them.

23:50.003 --> 23:51.292
So they're not stranger killings,

23:51.364 --> 23:53.621
but we can't find a
connection between them.

23:53.686 --> 23:57.470
I think we can. Could you
turn her arm round, please?

24:01.388 --> 24:04.017
Ta-da! There's your connection. Huxley.

24:04.087 --> 24:05.576
He has an alibi for both killings.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.416
Not one I'd trust.

24:08.955 --> 24:11.290
1-8-2-2.
What's that?

24:11.325 --> 24:12.570
What?

24:12.714 --> 24:14.674
There's numbers around the tattoo.

24:17.991 --> 24:19.876
Can you bring up Kevin's?

24:20.129 --> 24:21.519
Yeah.

24:21.606 --> 24:23.771
See? Same numbers on Kevin's.

24:23.925 --> 24:25.210
What do they mean?

24:25.329 --> 24:27.885
- I've no idea.
- Well, it proves Huxley was lying.

24:27.920 --> 24:30.208
No, it's just proves Kevin
was connected to the church.

24:30.269 --> 24:31.590
Huxley <i>is</i> the church.

24:31.654 --> 24:32.887
He said he'd never met Kevin.

24:32.953 --> 24:34.976
- OK.
- OK.

24:39.804 --> 24:42.049
Ade, Kevin had a tattoo removed.

24:42.084 --> 24:43.616
Do you know anything about that?

24:47.308 --> 24:50.473
I knew he had a tattoo
removed before we met.

24:50.651 --> 24:52.718
He said it was a mistake.

24:53.547 --> 24:55.166
There's some numbers under it.

24:56.245 --> 24:57.969
18-22.

24:58.460 --> 25:00.840
Why would he have Leviticus on his arm?

25:01.543 --> 25:02.917
Leviticus?

25:03.375 --> 25:06.677
Erm... Chapter 18, verse 22. Err...

25:07.393 --> 25:10.081
Man shall not lie with
man. It's abomination.

25:11.143 --> 25:12.783
That's what Huxley preaches.

25:14.703 --> 25:15.929
How do you know that?

25:16.018 --> 25:19.383
When I came out, my
parents wouldn't accept it.

25:19.485 --> 25:21.112
They thought I could be cured.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.604
It's what my dad shouted
at me when he kicked me out.

25:23.686 --> 25:26.483
Huxley was struck off the
register of psychiatrists.

25:26.551 --> 25:29.454
Gay conversion therapy is
against their code of practice.

25:29.510 --> 25:31.411
So Kevin joins Huxley's church,

25:31.475 --> 25:32.920
Huxley...

25:32.970 --> 25:34.913
tries to make him straight.

25:34.999 --> 25:37.827
We need to find out if that's
the reason he was struck off.

25:37.983 --> 25:40.543
Harry, wait. We need a court
order to get a copy of Huxley's

25:40.618 --> 25:43.177
disciplinary hearing, and we
need Winter's approval for that.

25:43.226 --> 25:44.061
Meh.

25:44.198 --> 25:45.918
You can't get it without Winter's approval.

25:45.953 --> 25:47.650
Yes, I can.

25:47.908 --> 25:49.164
What are you going to do?

25:49.240 --> 25:50.600
I'll think of something.

25:57.026 --> 25:59.211
_

26:59.485 --> 27:00.546
_

27:05.511 --> 27:06.364
_

27:11.196 --> 27:11.978
Come on.

27:12.041 --> 27:12.892
_

27:41.956 --> 27:46.341
- _
- <i>We have no defence against it.</i>

27:47.330 --> 27:49.032
Not any of us.

27:49.102 --> 27:52.278
Is there really anyone here
who believes themselves a match

27:52.330 --> 27:54.269
for Satan and all his words?

27:56.542 --> 27:59.510
Is there anyone here with an ego that big?

27:59.573 --> 28:02.570
Anthony Huxley, I need you to
accompany us to the station.

28:02.678 --> 28:04.090
And why is that?

28:04.237 --> 28:06.518
It's not a conversation
you want to have in public.

28:06.604 --> 28:07.810
I have nothing to hide.

28:07.845 --> 28:11.001
Anything you want to ask me, you can
do it in front of my congregation.

28:11.071 --> 28:13.423
You'll want a solicitor to be present.

28:13.556 --> 28:15.251
I see into you, Harry.

28:16.345 --> 28:18.495
I see how scared you are.

28:18.573 --> 28:19.939
Scared you can't stop.

28:20.006 --> 28:23.491
Scared your addiction will
destroy everything you hold dear.

28:23.636 --> 28:25.170
This man...

28:25.205 --> 28:27.650
is destroying his life through gambling.

28:29.095 --> 28:31.021
For your information, I don't gamble.

28:32.687 --> 28:33.850
Really?

28:34.107 --> 28:36.523
That's clearly news to your sergeant.

28:36.604 --> 28:39.157
How long has it been since
you've been at the tables, Harry?

28:39.227 --> 28:41.050
How long have you sworn off?

28:41.188 --> 28:43.234
Waking up every day
wondering if this is the day

28:43.269 --> 28:46.628
your willpower will break and
you'll roll the dice again.

28:47.285 --> 28:50.570
Gamble away your family, your career.

28:50.762 --> 28:52.210
You know nothing about me.

28:52.278 --> 28:54.734
Oh, I know everything about you...

28:55.095 --> 28:57.578
because, you see, Harry, I was you.

28:58.483 --> 29:00.181
I do see into you...

29:00.997 --> 29:03.099
...and you are terrified.

29:04.045 --> 29:05.350
I'm not scared of anything.

29:05.398 --> 29:08.181
Except the blackness of your own soul.

29:12.037 --> 29:14.243
Anthony Huxley, I am arresting
you on suspicion of murder...

29:14.278 --> 29:15.670
Harry... Harry...!

29:15.723 --> 29:18.190
...you do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence if,

29:18.260 --> 29:21.066
when questioned, you do not mention
something that you later rely on in court.

29:21.128 --> 29:22.747
Anything you do say can
be used in evidence...

29:22.782 --> 29:24.846
Sit down, Sean, or I'll put you down.

29:33.215 --> 29:35.380
We'll all pray for you, Harry.

29:35.602 --> 29:36.808
Cheers.

29:40.047 --> 29:41.224
Where's Harry?

29:43.488 --> 29:44.835
Sir, I'm joining him in the interview...

29:44.870 --> 29:46.482
Why's he arrested Anthony Huxley?

29:46.517 --> 29:49.945
I specifically told
him to follow procedure.

29:50.057 --> 29:51.074
We found a tangible connection...

29:51.109 --> 29:53.527
Are you going to spend the
rest of your life making excuses

29:53.589 --> 29:56.097
- for his behaviour?
- I'm not making excuses for anyone.

29:56.132 --> 29:58.319
She's telling the truth, sir.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.923
There's a link, she explained it to me.

30:00.978 --> 30:02.596
Huxley's been lying to them.

30:03.992 --> 30:05.592
Which interview room's he in?

30:14.808 --> 30:16.188
I have indulged you, Harry,

30:16.241 --> 30:19.078
because I feel some sympathy
for your gambling problem,

30:19.140 --> 30:21.956
but lashing out at me
with absurd allegations

30:22.006 --> 30:24.649
is not going to help you face your demons.

30:25.388 --> 30:28.519
You lied to me about
not knowing Kevin Jones.

30:28.577 --> 30:30.537
He was a member of your congregation.

30:31.461 --> 30:36.513
Kevin had a tattoo on his arm
of the cross from your church.

30:36.536 --> 30:38.923
Half of London decorate
their bodies with the cross.

30:38.989 --> 30:41.754
The tragedy is, they don't
take it into their hearts.

30:41.789 --> 30:44.874
Melanie Spencer, also a
member of your congregation,

30:44.965 --> 30:46.822
had the same tattoo.

30:46.858 --> 30:50.783
The two things these people
had in common are you.

30:51.157 --> 30:53.481
And the fact that they
were both brutally murdered.

30:55.002 --> 30:57.722
That's why I've been
arrested? That's it? Really?

30:59.951 --> 31:02.031
Please tell me this isn't all he's got?

31:03.597 --> 31:04.557
Not quite.

31:11.641 --> 31:16.172
"Dr. Huxley has repeatedly breached
professional rules of conduct,

31:16.265 --> 31:19.388
"pursuing his unethical and
damaging conversion therapy with

31:19.423 --> 31:21.121
"vulnerable gay clients.

31:21.196 --> 31:24.025
No, no, no, no... that
report was confidential.

31:24.060 --> 31:27.696
"He is..." And this is my favourite part,

31:28.391 --> 31:32.027
"...pathological in his
hatred of gay men, and is

31:32.078 --> 31:36.508
"a danger to vulnerable lesbians
and gay men in the community."

31:36.570 --> 31:39.695
I only didn't tell you that I
knew Kevin because I knew you

31:39.730 --> 31:42.495
would jump to exactly this conclusion.

31:42.530 --> 31:46.106
But you did know him, didn't you?
You tried to make him straight.

31:46.155 --> 31:49.815
At the church, after I'd stopped
practising as a psychiatrist.

31:49.865 --> 31:52.530
There is nothing illegal about that.

31:52.592 --> 31:54.202
And when he refused your offer of help,

31:54.237 --> 31:56.120
you couldn't let it go, could you?

31:56.181 --> 31:58.786
You pursued him, you murdered him.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.211
Harry...

32:01.145 --> 32:02.865
why would I kill Kevin?

32:04.146 --> 32:05.760
I was the same as him.

32:08.109 --> 32:09.437
What do you mean?

32:10.382 --> 32:13.860
I was led out of the
darkness of homosexuality,

32:13.895 --> 32:18.290
and so I lead others into the light.
And they, in turn, help others.

32:18.332 --> 32:20.330
We are all sinners, Harry.

32:20.421 --> 32:24.205
But some of us are willing to
face our demons and banish them.

32:24.670 --> 32:26.347
Is that all? Can I go?

32:26.413 --> 32:30.098
We are going to have one mother
of a complaint made against us.

32:30.214 --> 32:33.859
Kevin tried this therapy with other men?

32:33.940 --> 32:36.570
We keep our recovery from homosexuality

32:36.659 --> 32:39.011
by giving that recovery to others.

32:39.851 --> 32:43.089
Kevin was my greatest protege.

32:43.167 --> 32:44.741
Who did he try to convert?

32:44.791 --> 32:47.987
Members of the church. Lots
of people came to us for help.

32:48.061 --> 32:50.112
Did he convert Melanie Spencer?

32:50.179 --> 32:52.183
Melanie wasn't gay.

32:52.218 --> 32:54.903
She wore the tattoo to support her husband.

32:55.458 --> 32:58.412
Kevin converted Robert Spencer?

32:58.485 --> 32:59.785
Yes. Why?

33:02.920 --> 33:07.394
It's 1:40pm, I am terminating the
interview and turning off the tape.

33:07.452 --> 33:09.281
Take him back to the cells,
he hasn't killed anyone.

33:09.327 --> 33:11.598
Well, that's what I've
been telling you all along.

33:11.856 --> 33:14.345
- And I think I'm owed an apology.
- Apology?

33:15.169 --> 33:17.450
You may not have killed anyone physically,

33:17.657 --> 33:19.985
but you sure as hell have
got blood on your hands.

33:20.020 --> 33:22.317
Y... I know, I know. Just...

33:22.411 --> 33:25.051
Orwell, bring up the CCTV
footage from the club.

33:27.587 --> 33:29.332
I've viewed this footage a dozen times.

33:29.385 --> 33:31.773
If there was anything on
here, I would have seen it.

33:31.838 --> 33:34.088
I kept asking myself, why
would Kevin leave the club?

33:34.158 --> 33:35.701
Ade said he wouldn't
leave with someone else,

33:35.762 --> 33:38.690
but why abandon your
fiancee on your stag night?

33:38.748 --> 33:40.659
Right, here's Kevin Jones.

33:41.246 --> 33:43.932
- No-one follows him out.
- No, go back, go back.

33:46.496 --> 33:47.456
There.

33:48.654 --> 33:50.313
Leaving ahead of him.

33:51.119 --> 33:53.667
- Who's that?
- Melanie Spencer's husband.

33:53.715 --> 33:55.549
- How could you miss that?
- Oh, my God.

33:55.584 --> 33:58.592
No, Melanie Spencer was still
alive when I viewed this footage,

33:58.651 --> 33:59.838
her husband wasn't in the frame.

33:59.892 --> 34:02.244
We were looking for a connection
between Kevin and Melanie.

34:02.307 --> 34:04.440
Kevin was involved in
converting gay men at the church,

34:04.522 --> 34:06.756
Melanie's husband was
a member of that church.

34:06.791 --> 34:08.943
Robert Spencer is the connection.

34:30.717 --> 34:34.264
All right, we've got officers
at all the ports and stations.

34:34.391 --> 34:37.424
Spencer's car will light up the
ANPR like a Christmas tree if

34:37.458 --> 34:40.304
he even indicates onto an A road.

34:40.458 --> 34:43.536
- He's not going to run.
- Why not?

34:43.572 --> 34:44.696
When we first interviewed him,

34:44.731 --> 34:46.797
he had no reservation about giving his DNA.

34:46.877 --> 34:47.745
No.

34:48.206 --> 34:51.505
- So it's never been about getting away.
- So what is it about?

34:51.577 --> 34:54.815
In his mind, he's putting things right.

34:55.956 --> 34:58.177
Then we need more officers on this search.

34:58.233 --> 34:59.439
- All right.
- Yes.

34:59.512 --> 35:01.376
All right, uh...

35:01.428 --> 35:03.248
- Incident room.
- <i>Custody suite.</i>

35:03.311 --> 35:05.868
- <i>Huxley's brief is asking for release?</i>
- No.

35:05.930 --> 35:08.175
Best keep him under lock and key.

35:08.261 --> 35:08.800
Who's that?

35:08.847 --> 35:11.901
Huxley's solicitor
wants him out. I said no.

35:11.979 --> 35:13.779
Not with Spencer on the loose.

35:15.048 --> 35:17.836
Steve, bring up the CCTV footage again.

35:26.141 --> 35:27.691
I don't know how I missed that.

35:27.770 --> 35:30.225
I checked every feed, I logged every face.

35:30.260 --> 35:32.318
Like you said, Spencer wasn't on the radar

35:32.373 --> 35:33.594
when you went through the tapes.

35:33.629 --> 35:36.945
No, I should have checked
again. After the second death.

35:36.980 --> 35:38.647
This is DI Clayton, change of plan.

35:38.733 --> 35:40.493
You can release Anthony Huxley.

35:42.375 --> 35:46.324
You know, one day, Harry's
luck is going to run out.

35:46.396 --> 35:49.128
You're not careful, he's going
to take you down with him.

35:49.163 --> 35:50.801
If you spent more time
thinking about your work

35:50.856 --> 35:53.346
and less about Harry,
you'd get better results.

35:53.410 --> 35:55.369
He sure as hell isn't thinking about you.

35:58.265 --> 35:59.345
Where is he?

36:38.063 --> 36:39.985
Harry!

36:42.560 --> 36:43.760
Harry!

36:44.405 --> 36:45.786
It's alright, guys.

36:45.821 --> 36:47.392
I'm going to get us out of here.

36:50.963 --> 36:54.851
Jesus! Come on, get your seat
belts off! You can do it, come on!

36:56.060 --> 36:58.662
I'll take care of him! Go, go!

37:01.050 --> 37:02.415
Go, run!

37:02.473 --> 37:05.564
Go, it will be fine! Go, Harry! Go!

37:43.286 --> 37:45.651
This could all be over in a moment.

37:45.780 --> 37:47.073
You'll be at peace.

37:48.577 --> 37:50.611
Wouldn't that be a relief?

37:50.977 --> 37:52.273
You're right.

37:52.379 --> 37:53.738
I deserve to die.

37:55.953 --> 37:57.236
It'll be a relief.

38:00.740 --> 38:04.047
I'll do you first, and then I'll do me.

38:04.601 --> 38:06.572
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, please!

38:06.642 --> 38:08.705
Please, stop!

38:08.793 --> 38:10.882
I'm begging you, please!

38:11.533 --> 38:13.479
Robert, wait.

38:14.116 --> 38:15.745
You come any closer and
I'll slit his throat now.

38:15.780 --> 38:16.908
Oh, no, no, no, no, no...

38:19.742 --> 38:21.579
I know what happened, Robert.

38:22.648 --> 38:24.394
I know why you killed Kevin.

38:26.010 --> 38:27.131
I understand.

38:28.618 --> 38:31.075
- You couldn't understand.
- I do.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.502
You went to the club,

38:35.463 --> 38:37.104
and there he was.

38:37.732 --> 38:39.395
On his stag night.

38:40.460 --> 38:41.814
Getting married.

38:43.340 --> 38:45.066
The life you should have had.

38:47.233 --> 38:49.662
- It could've been me.
- I know.

38:51.105 --> 38:52.065
Should've been.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.208
God, I loved him.

38:58.129 --> 39:02.183
And all those bloody stupid
sessions, pretending to change.

39:04.252 --> 39:06.028
When all I wanted him to do...

39:07.121 --> 39:08.281
was hold me.

39:10.227 --> 39:14.037
He followed you out of the club,
didn't he? He wanted to talk to you.

39:17.194 --> 39:18.754
He said we could start again.

39:19.751 --> 39:21.345
Start a new life.

39:21.785 --> 39:23.305
Said it wasn't too late.

39:25.376 --> 39:27.710
But he didn't have a wife and two kids.

39:27.773 --> 39:29.370
He hadn't ruined everything because of him.

39:29.405 --> 39:30.915
No, no, no, no, no, no!

39:30.950 --> 39:31.985
Yeah.

39:32.257 --> 39:34.781
- Yeah, well, this is where it ends.
- No. Please, please, please, please...

39:34.841 --> 39:37.561
No-one else is going to go
through what I went through.

39:41.553 --> 39:42.316
Do it.

39:44.437 --> 39:45.397
What?

39:46.762 --> 39:47.722
Do it.

39:50.717 --> 39:52.505
He's responsible.

39:52.680 --> 39:53.868
For Kevin.

39:55.034 --> 39:56.529
For Melanie.

39:58.107 --> 39:59.779
His hypocrisy.

40:01.104 --> 40:04.361
- His lies.
- Harry, please!

40:04.439 --> 40:06.467
You'd be doing the world a favour.

40:09.260 --> 40:10.385
Ahh!

40:14.019 --> 40:16.187
He was going to kill me!

40:16.354 --> 40:17.434
Me!

40:24.274 --> 40:25.813
Cut me loose, Harry.

40:27.023 --> 40:28.441
Thank God.

40:28.820 --> 40:29.892
Cut me loose.

40:48.193 --> 40:49.949
Untie me, Harry.

40:51.823 --> 40:53.103
Harry!

41:03.860 --> 41:06.390
So, if I were to ask the custody
sergeant, "Who released Huxley?,"

41:06.468 --> 41:08.483
would I like the answer?

41:08.671 --> 41:11.419
- We got him, didn't we?
- Yeah, Robert Spencer, it wasn't Huxley.

41:11.521 --> 41:13.866
- Your instincts were wrong.
- I was half right.

41:14.135 --> 41:16.492
- Right-ish.
- No, you were lucky.

41:24.583 --> 41:25.855
I can't talk now.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.131
- Hi.
- Hey.

41:28.197 --> 41:30.988
Come on, Dais, you'll
miss the start of the film.

41:33.180 --> 41:35.465
She can't go anywhere without eyeliner.

41:35.593 --> 41:37.042
She's really bad at it.

41:38.305 --> 41:39.509
Hi, Dad.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.947
Oh, my God, Robert Smith in the flesh.

41:42.603 --> 41:43.905
Who?

41:43.979 --> 41:44.899
In you get.

41:47.455 --> 41:49.050
You sure this is a good idea?

41:49.985 --> 41:51.458
There's nothing new on Golding.

41:51.581 --> 41:53.019
I'm doing everything I can, I promise.

41:53.089 --> 41:55.788
Anyway, I wouldn't take her
out if there was any risk.

41:55.854 --> 41:58.469
- You wouldn't take that gamble, right?
- Of course not.

41:58.531 --> 42:00.874
- Not again, anyway.
- Oh, Jesus.

42:00.939 --> 42:02.197
Sorry, that was low.

42:03.706 --> 42:04.634
Go on, have fun.

42:04.705 --> 42:06.131
I don't know what to say.

42:07.041 --> 42:09.074
- If I could take it off...
- Don't.

42:09.320 --> 42:12.103
- I keep trying to tell you.
- There is no magic.

42:13.450 --> 42:15.130
You're an addict.

42:16.144 --> 42:17.645
That's all there is.

42:17.727 --> 42:18.833
Dad.

42:19.740 --> 42:20.754
Yeah.

42:21.524 --> 42:24.153
- Go on, you'll miss it.
- Anna.

42:37.312 --> 42:38.312
Hello.

42:39.660 --> 42:42.256
Ah, you sound tired.

42:42.326 --> 42:44.311
Yeah, long day. This case, you know?

42:44.389 --> 42:46.644
The awful Huxley.

42:46.738 --> 42:48.482
Sometimes, there's no justice.

42:49.418 --> 42:51.698
Fortune favours the bold, Harry.

42:51.763 --> 42:54.818
As far as I can tell, it
favours bigoted hypocrites.

42:55.788 --> 42:58.585
You should learn to trust in the bracelet.

42:58.723 --> 43:01.080
Even with the bracelet,
I failed to stop him.

43:02.043 --> 43:03.888
Why would you say that, Harry?

43:16.021 --> 43:18.046
Luck always finds a way.

43:18.081 --> 43:21.606
If that were true, Anthony
Huxley wouldn't be walking around.

43:22.112 --> 43:25.676
Oh, Harry, I think you'd be surprised.

43:31.149 --> 43:32.013
- _
- Something strange turned up

43:32.065 --> 43:34.885
in the contents of his
stomach. Human flesh.

43:34.943 --> 43:35.945
You think I did it.

43:36.031 --> 43:37.289
You made the pies yourself?

- Get me backup, now!
- The silver bracelet on her wrist, Harry.

43:42.699 --> 43:43.867

43:43.930 --> 43:45.532

I found out who the girl
is, it's Eve Alexandri.

43:53.480 --> 43:55.013

43:55.048 --> 43:56.966
