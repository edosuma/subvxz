Whose birthday is it?

00:14.480 --> 00:16.070
Everyone's!

00:16.100 --> 00:17.940
We celebrate them all on Birthday Day

00:17.970 --> 00:20.100
so we don't have to have
25 parties and 25 cakes.

00:21.970 --> 00:25.040
Yeah. It's part of Principal
Skidmore's "War on Fun."

00:27.280 --> 00:30.950
For the record, I am against anything
that reduces cake consumption.

00:32.580 --> 00:33.990
It's un-American.

00:38.290 --> 00:40.990
Okay!
Time to exchange gifts!

00:42.030 --> 00:43.930
Oh, right, gifts.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.060
Let me just go get them.

00:49.070 --> 00:50.000
This is for you.

00:52.100 --> 00:53.970
This is for you.

00:54.310 --> 00:55.270
Oh!

00:55.310 --> 00:55.340
This is for you.

01:00.110 --> 01:03.980
And for you, Olive, I got...

01:04.019 --> 01:06.920
A "Caution: Wet Floor" sign!

01:08.120 --> 01:10.220
It's in English and Spanish!

01:10.260 --> 01:11.290
I love this so much!

01:13.930 --> 01:14.930
Whoa!

01:18.100 --> 01:20.900
School should really get one of these.

Hope you didn't get anything
this nice for Fletcher.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.890
You wouldn't want to lead him on

02:20.930 --> 02:22.030
since he's totally in love with you.

02:24.030 --> 02:25.860
What?

02:25.900 --> 02:27.970
Olive, Fletcher is not in love with me.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.830
And I'm giving him this glove
I got from the dumpster.

02:29.870 --> 02:31.200
I mean, the mall.

02:31.240 --> 02:35.870
Well, just in case, casually mention to him

02:35.910 --> 02:36.970
that you have a boyfriend.

02:37.010 --> 02:39.140
That way you let him down easy.

02:39.180 --> 02:42.850
But, Olive, I don't have a boyfriend.

02:42.880 --> 02:45.150
And even if I did, casually mention that?

02:46.920 --> 02:48.850
Like this.
"Hey, Fletcher.

02:48.890 --> 02:49.990
"Do you know what the specials are

02:50.020 --> 02:50.990
"in the 'I have
a boyfriend' cafeteria?"

02:53.090 --> 02:55.130
Hey, Chyna.
Happy Birthday Day.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.970
A remote control plane!

03:02.000 --> 03:04.070
Cool!
Thank you so much.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.140
Yeah.
Let me show you how it works.

03:05.170 --> 03:06.170
Okay.

03:09.840 --> 03:10.970
Ooh, a plane.

03:13.910 --> 03:15.150
He must love me.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.030
I have a boyfriend.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.900
And do you know what the specials are

03:35.930 --> 03:39.940
in the 'I have a boyfriend' cafeteria?

03:39.970 --> 03:42.210
Because I have a boyfriend, and
my boyfriend wants to know.

03:43.940 --> 03:43.970
Boyfriend.

03:46.140 --> 03:48.910
Wow, I'm so embarrassed.

03:48.950 --> 03:50.110
I gave you the wrong gift.

03:50.150 --> 03:50.950
This one's for my girlfriend.

03:54.020 --> 03:56.890
You have a girlfriend?

03:56.920 --> 03:58.920
Oh, yeah, and that message was for her.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.960
You see, I got you a plane that says,

04:01.990 --> 04:02.990
"Hey look!
I got you a plane,

04:05.200 --> 04:06.900
"just like the one I
got my girlfriend."

04:08.130 --> 04:09.200
Girlfriend.

04:15.110 --> 04:17.910
I've got terrible news.

04:17.940 --> 04:18.940
Coach Mandy quit.

04:20.950 --> 04:20.980
Breathing.

04:22.180 --> 04:24.110
What?

04:24.150 --> 04:26.050
She always told us never to quit.

04:28.850 --> 04:29.950
What a hypocrite.

04:32.060 --> 04:33.120
What now?

04:33.160 --> 04:35.860
The Pom Pom Cheerlympics are on Friday.

04:35.890 --> 04:36.890
Who's going to be our coach?

04:36.930 --> 04:40.100
Hey, guys!
I'm going to be your new coach!

04:40.130 --> 04:41.970
So, who's ready to make some noise?

04:44.170 --> 04:45.940
Gibson?

04:45.970 --> 04:48.940
What could you possibly
know about cheerleading?

04:48.970 --> 04:51.910
It so happens

04:51.940 --> 04:54.980
I was cheerleading captain
when I went to Webster,

04:55.010 --> 04:56.050
until the incident.

04:58.880 --> 05:01.890
<i>I had led my squad</i>
<i>to the finals.</i>

05:01.920 --> 05:04.960
<i>I was hoisting</i> <i>Samantha
Herkheimer</i> <i>into the air,</i>

05:04.990 --> 05:08.860
<i>when a ladybug</i>
<i>landed on me.</i>

05:08.890 --> 05:10.890
<i>For most,</i>
<i>it's a sign of luck.</i>

05:10.930 --> 05:12.900
<i>For me, it triggered</i>
<i>a horrific memory.</i>

05:14.830 --> 05:18.140
<i>I was riding the bike I got</i>
<i>for my tenth birthday,</i>

05:18.170 --> 05:20.940
<i>when a ladybug landed</i>
<i>on my hair helmet.</i>

05:22.910 --> 05:24.940
<i>It was</i>
<i>a traumatic experience,</i>

05:24.980 --> 05:27.040
<i>not just for me.</i>

05:27.080 --> 05:31.010
<i>It reminded the ladybug</i>
<i>of a horrific incident</i>

05:31.050 --> 05:33.050
<i>it had witnessed</i>
<i>just days earlier.</i>

05:33.080 --> 05:39.990
<i>It watched its own mother</i> <i>being
eaten</i> <i>by a praying mantis.</i>

05:40.020 --> 05:42.990
<i>Mommy! Mommy! No!</i>

05:43.030 --> 05:45.900
Mommy!
I'll always love you!

05:47.870 --> 05:49.170
Does this story have a point?

05:49.200 --> 05:53.000
Yes. The point is,
as you can see,

05:53.040 --> 05:55.210
I'm perfectly qualified
to coach cheerleading.

05:59.210 --> 06:02.810
I shouldn't have lied
about having a boyfriend.

06:02.850 --> 06:04.780
I mean, what if Fletcher wants to meet him?

06:04.820 --> 06:06.150
He does.

06:06.180 --> 06:08.890
That's why I set up a double date
for you guys on Friday night.

06:11.060 --> 06:13.760
Why would you do that?

06:13.790 --> 06:15.790
Because I couldn't get a
reservation on Saturday.

06:17.060 --> 06:19.060
Anyway, it'll be fun!

06:19.100 --> 06:21.160
Olive, I don't actually have a boyfriend.

06:23.070 --> 06:23.900
Oh.

06:23.940 --> 06:26.140
Then it probably won't be that fun.

06:29.940 --> 06:31.110
A double date?

06:31.140 --> 06:32.940
Dude, you don't have a girlfriend.

06:32.980 --> 06:34.780
I know!

06:34.810 --> 06:37.050
I mean, I don't know why I said yes!

06:37.080 --> 06:40.180
It's Olive. She got all in my
head and twisted my brain around.

06:41.950 --> 06:44.050
She's like an evil sorceress.

06:45.990 --> 06:48.030
Yeah.
It's hot, isn't it?

06:51.030 --> 06:52.900
What am I going to do?

06:52.930 --> 06:54.060
How am I going to find a
girlfriend by Friday?

06:54.100 --> 06:59.870
I've been trying nonstop
for 11 years and nothing!

06:59.900 --> 07:02.070
Hey, if I could bottle
my lady magic I would.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.710
But you can basically get the same effect

07:06.740 --> 07:08.710
by rubbing a hamburger on yourself.

07:15.150 --> 07:17.750
Okay, ladies.
We have a big competition Friday night.

07:17.790 --> 07:19.090
Let's see what you got.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.790
And five, six, seven...

07:20.820 --> 07:22.960
Stop! I've seen enough!

07:25.030 --> 07:27.790
We have a lot of work to do.

07:27.830 --> 07:29.060
Let's start with the basics.

07:29.100 --> 07:32.130
What is cheerleading all about?

07:32.170 --> 07:34.770
Being popular and making
everyone else at school

07:34.800 --> 07:35.970
feel bad about themselves.

07:37.170 --> 07:40.110
No, that's only part of it.

07:40.140 --> 07:41.980
A lot of people don't know,

07:42.010 --> 07:44.180
"cheerleading" is actually an acronym.

07:48.850 --> 07:51.890
The "C" stands for, well, cheerleading.

07:53.190 --> 07:55.920
The "H" stands for heart.

07:56.190 --> 07:57.990
The "E"...

07:58.030 --> 07:59.890
Oh, man, I forgot what "E" stands for!

08:02.030 --> 08:04.060
Eggs? Emphysema?

08:05.070 --> 08:06.770
Earwax?

08:07.840 --> 08:10.040
What about "E" for effort?

08:10.070 --> 08:10.900
No. That makes no sense.

08:13.010 --> 08:15.080
What about "E" for fun?

08:16.140 --> 08:18.750
Ooh, how about energy?

08:18.780 --> 08:20.050
Let's go with energy.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.080
Okay, next.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.050
Oh, man!
Not another "E!"

08:29.860 --> 08:30.790
I don't know, Chyna.

08:30.830 --> 08:33.890
Holding auditions to find a fake boyfriend?

08:33.929 --> 08:36.799
I can get any guy with just my eyes.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.870
Look, don't worry.
I can feel it.

08:42.900 --> 08:46.140
The perfect boy is about
to walk through that door.

08:49.840 --> 08:55.150
Next!

08:55.180 --> 08:58.820
Hi. My name is Jared and I'll be
reading for the part of the boyfriend.

08:58.850 --> 09:01.050
By the way, I really enjoyed your
play, "My Dinner With Chyna."

09:01.090 --> 09:03.090
Powerful stuff.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.790
Well, thank you.
I'll read with you.

09:07.130 --> 09:11.000
Knock knock. Hi.
I'm here to pick up Chyna.

09:13.830 --> 09:16.070
Nice to meet you.
I am Chyna.

09:18.810 --> 09:22.980
Wow. You are the most
beautiful, pretty, lovely,

09:23.010 --> 09:28.110
gorgeous, well put together,
attractive, charming, vivacious, cute,

09:29.120 --> 09:32.120
mesmerizing girl I have ever laid eyes on.

09:32.150 --> 09:36.820
He's perfect.

09:36.860 --> 09:38.890
If you want to go with the obvious choice.

09:38.930 --> 09:40.760
I like this guy.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.030
He's got animal magnetism.

09:48.100 --> 09:51.070
All right. Getting a girlfriend
is all a numbers game.

09:51.110 --> 09:51.910
If you ask enough girls out,

09:51.940 --> 09:54.870
one of them will eventually say yes.

09:54.910 --> 09:56.040
But, before you do.

10:03.180 --> 10:05.090
Okay, okay, okay.

10:10.060 --> 10:10.890
Hey.
Are you free Friday night?

10:14.000 --> 10:16.030
Either of you free Friday night?

10:19.970 --> 10:22.140
Hey, are you free Friday night?

10:22.170 --> 10:23.200
Please don't hit me.

10:24.170 --> 10:25.970
Actually, I am.

10:26.010 --> 10:27.210
You need a babysitter?

10:28.180 --> 10:31.140
Um. Yes. Yes I do.

10:33.080 --> 10:35.220
I'll have my mom call you
as soon as you turn around.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.550
Hello?

10:41.590 --> 10:46.130
Hello, this is Mrs.
Quimby calling about my little boy, Fletchie.

10:47.960 --> 10:49.930
Wow! Great reception!

10:49.960 --> 10:51.230
You sound like you're in
the same room with me.

10:59.970 --> 11:03.140
The "L" stands for leadership.
And...

11:03.180 --> 11:05.080
Seriously, another "E"?

11:07.080 --> 11:09.820
Any questions?

11:09.850 --> 11:12.820
Do baby teeth ever come back

11:12.850 --> 11:14.920
or does the tooth fairy keep them forever?

11:17.120 --> 11:18.990
I have a question.

11:19.030 --> 11:21.900
Are we ever going to do
any actual cheerleading?

11:21.930 --> 11:22.930
Yes.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.060
Thk goodness.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.970
You do get your baby teeth back.

11:27.970 --> 11:28.900
Okay. Now, we're going
to make a pyramid.

11:36.910 --> 11:39.110
Okay, there are 6,000 more of
these out in the parking lot.

11:39.150 --> 11:39.910
Go team!

11:42.980 --> 11:43.980
Whoo!

11:51.890 --> 11:54.830
Hey, Olive!

11:54.860 --> 11:57.900
I want your opinion about what
outfit I should wear tomorrow night.

11:57.930 --> 11:59.170
What do you think of this?

11:59.200 --> 12:00.870
Too flouncy.

12:03.170 --> 12:05.070
How about this one?

12:05.110 --> 12:07.010
Too formal.

12:10.780 --> 12:11.480
Well, how about this one?

12:11.510 --> 12:12.780
Oh, and for modesty's sake,

12:12.810 --> 12:14.880
I really hope you like it.

12:15.950 --> 12:18.890
I do, but it's missing a key accessory

12:18.920 --> 12:20.790
that would tie it all together.

12:20.820 --> 12:22.020
Oh, you mean, like a purse?

12:22.060 --> 12:22.920
No, I mean, like a unicycle.

12:26.860 --> 12:28.930
What?

12:28.960 --> 12:31.770
Fletcher has been asking a lot of
questions about your boyfriend,

12:31.800 --> 12:33.800
so I told him you met
while riding a unicycle.

12:33.830 --> 12:35.800
Why would you say that?

12:35.840 --> 12:38.100
Because, in order to make
a lie more believable,

12:38.140 --> 12:40.010
you have to have specific details.

12:41.110 --> 12:42.980
So, in case it comes up,

12:43.010 --> 12:45.880
you both met on a plane in
2008 and exchanged numbers.

12:45.910 --> 12:47.980
But you absentmindedly used
it to spit out your gum,

12:48.020 --> 12:49.850
so you lost touch, until
you ran into each other

12:49.880 --> 12:53.990
at the Sydney Opera House's production
of Verdi's <i>La Traviata.</i>

12:56.920 --> 12:59.160
Then you lost touch again, until last year,

12:59.190 --> 13:01.860
when you all went on your annual
family unicycling trip in.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.960
Venkatanarasimharajuvaripeta, India.

13:06.800 --> 13:10.070
Olive, I'm never going to be
able to remember all that.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.870
You have to come with me.

13:11.910 --> 13:13.940
What? No, I don't have
anyone to go with.

13:13.970 --> 13:17.840
Looks like you need some arm candy.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.200
Ooh, look!
Arm candy!

13:27.430 --> 13:29.840
Okay, girls, a next lesson.

13:29.880 --> 13:31.850
Projecting your voice.

13:31.880 --> 13:35.720
It's a skill my father taught
me at a very young age.

13:35.750 --> 13:36.780
Ooh, was he a cheerleader?

13:36.820 --> 13:38.990
No, he just had road rage.

13:41.090 --> 13:42.060
Here's how the drill works.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.960
What's the matter with you?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.800
Where'd you get your license?
A cereal box?

13:54.740 --> 13:55.970
Okay, now your turn.

13:56.010 --> 13:57.940
So, everyone, go to the parking
lot and get a car door.

14:01.740 --> 14:04.050
No. We're not doing it.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.050
What? I can't hear you.
Hold on.

14:08.950 --> 14:09.880
Okay. Go.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.890
We're not doing any more
of your dumb drills.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.920
You're out.

14:15.930 --> 14:17.690
Wait!

14:17.730 --> 14:18.990
I smell mutiny!

14:19.030 --> 14:21.930
And not just because I'm wearing
a cologne called "Mutiny."

14:23.870 --> 14:24.970
I think you'll change your mind

14:25.000 --> 14:26.800
once you see my choreography.

14:26.840 --> 14:28.000
Watch this.

14:51.060 --> 14:53.800
Sorry, but we voted.

14:53.830 --> 14:55.760
Seven votes to get rid of you,

14:55.800 --> 14:58.070
zero votes to keep you,

14:58.100 --> 15:00.100
and one vote for Clay Aiken.

15:04.010 --> 15:06.910
Fine. I'll go.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.040
You won't have Gibson
to kick around anymore.

15:12.010 --> 15:14.720
So I'll leave you this dummy
of me to kick around instead.

15:17.690 --> 15:18.950
Here, I'll get you started.

15:31.830 --> 15:35.640
Hey, Fletcher.
Where's your mommy?

15:35.670 --> 15:36.800
Did she leave you here all by yourself?

15:36.840 --> 15:39.010
Oh, no, she saw you coming in.

15:39.840 --> 15:42.040
Bye, Mommy!
Love you!

15:48.820 --> 15:49.980
I miss my mommy.
Could you hold my hand?

15:50.020 --> 15:52.990
Of course, Fletchie.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.960
Would a hug help?

15:54.990 --> 15:56.020
It's worth a shot.

16:00.930 --> 16:02.660
Where is Jared?

16:02.700 --> 16:04.700
I specifically told him
his character was punctual.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.870
Wait, Pi is a math themed restaurant?

16:09.910 --> 16:13.840
No, it's the math themed restaurant.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.740
It is way better than
Long Division John Silver's.

16:20.620 --> 16:21.880
Hey, guys!
This is Ella.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.820
Isn't she sweet?

16:23.850 --> 16:25.920
So, Chyna, where's your boyfriend?

16:25.950 --> 16:28.820
Good evening, friends, Romans, countrymen!

16:30.930 --> 16:32.630
'Sup.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.740
Whoo! Go Wolves!

16:47.740 --> 16:49.810
The ladybug mishap also
affected my ability to

16:49.850 --> 16:50.710
clap at a normal pace.

16:53.020 --> 16:55.750
Gibson, you're too late.

16:55.780 --> 16:58.950
We performed without you
and we were awesome.

16:58.990 --> 17:00.790
Oh, I'm not here for you.

17:00.820 --> 17:05.730
Webster Wolves, meet the Gibsonettes.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.829
Lexi, this is Susan.
Susan, this is Paisley.

17:11.869 --> 17:14.740
Paisley, this is Becky.
Becky, did you meet Lexi?

17:14.770 --> 17:15.700
You know what?
We'll do names after.

17:49.670 --> 17:50.970
They're really good.

17:51.010 --> 17:54.980
Shut up, Paisley!

17:55.010 --> 17:57.850
You really have to work
on your bad sportsmanship.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.640
Ladybug!

18:31.780 --> 18:34.780
Awesome!
Now we're going to win for sure!

18:34.820 --> 18:36.650
Huh.

18:36.690 --> 18:39.850
In the movies, the ragtag
team of misfits usually wins,

18:39.890 --> 18:42.760
not the team headed by the
evil blonde cheerleader.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.690
I'll get this one.

18:46.730 --> 18:47.900
Shut up, Paisley!

18:50.870 --> 18:52.630
Open your mouth.

18:52.670 --> 18:54.770
Here comes the spoon with your food on it.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.740
I don't like to talk down to kids.

18:58.770 --> 19:00.840
They know it's not a train,
I know it's not a train.

19:02.680 --> 19:03.740
Why is she feeding you?

19:03.780 --> 19:06.610
Oh. Ella loves to
take care of me.

19:06.650 --> 19:10.550
But enough about our
rock solid relationship.

19:10.590 --> 19:12.550
Let's talk about you.

19:12.590 --> 19:15.820
So, Jared, besides unicycling and dueling,

19:15.860 --> 19:17.730
do you do anything interesting?

19:19.660 --> 19:21.800
We mostly like to
spend quiet time together.

19:21.830 --> 19:24.830
That is, when he's not breeding llamas.

19:26.670 --> 19:28.670
Right.

19:28.700 --> 19:29.870
He doesn't like to talk about that.

19:29.910 --> 19:30.740
I love llamas.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.780
Cradling a baby llama in my hands.

19:35.810 --> 19:37.680
There's nothing more life affirming.

19:38.750 --> 19:39.710
They're so gentle.

19:39.750 --> 19:42.850
Actually, llamas can be quite vicious

19:42.890 --> 19:45.720
and prone to spitting and
sounding their distinctive alarm.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.830
Why do you always undermine me?

19:52.860 --> 19:56.730
Ever since Chyna and I started
dating, you felt threatened!

19:56.770 --> 19:59.670
Threatened I was stealing your best friend!

19:59.700 --> 20:02.800
And I know it was you who cut
the brakes on my unicycle!

20:03.970 --> 20:05.810
Aw!

20:05.840 --> 20:09.740
He's so possessive, and dramatic,
and slightly unstable.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.750
But that's what I love about him!

20:17.650 --> 20:18.920
Mommy usually rubs my back after dinner.

20:18.950 --> 20:20.660
Can you do that?

20:20.690 --> 20:22.820
Aw! You have
a little gas bubble?

20:22.860 --> 20:24.660
No, I don't have a...

20:26.660 --> 20:27.860
Huh. I guess I did.

20:29.030 --> 20:31.670
She's so attentive.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.670
Well, that's what I get paid for.

20:33.700 --> 20:34.840
Tell your mommies,

20:34.870 --> 20:36.770
because references are
everything in my line of work.

20:37.940 --> 20:39.810
Work?

20:39.840 --> 20:40.910
Right, because...

20:40.940 --> 20:44.850
Because relationships are a lot of work.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.680
Tell me about it.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.680
Olive can be a handful,

20:49.820 --> 20:52.650
but she's worth the effort.

20:52.690 --> 20:52.790
More bread?

20:57.690 --> 20:59.830
Hey, don't I know you?

21:00.060 --> 21:02.830
Oh, yeah.

21:02.860 --> 21:04.900
Two years ago, New Year's Eve.

21:05.870 --> 21:09.670
Wait a minute.
You guys used to date?

21:09.710 --> 21:12.770
What?
No, I babysat for him.

21:14.910 --> 21:15.610
Now I babysit Fletcher.

21:15.640 --> 21:16.680
Small world, huh?

21:17.980 --> 21:19.850
She's your babysitter?

21:19.880 --> 21:23.650
No. Wow,
are you jealous!

21:23.690 --> 21:26.650
To make up a story like that

21:26.690 --> 21:28.760
and implant it in her head somehow.

21:30.830 --> 21:31.930
What is going on here?

21:31.960 --> 21:33.860
I'll tell you what's going on!

21:33.900 --> 21:36.660
Someone at this table

21:36.700 --> 21:37.730
is a murderer!

21:41.770 --> 21:43.900
You hired her to pretend
to be your girlfriend?

21:44.040 --> 21:47.810
Fine, the truth is,

21:47.840 --> 21:48.980
I pretended I had a girlfriend

21:49.010 --> 21:50.980
because this thing between you and me...

21:53.850 --> 21:54.780
You're just coming on too strong.

21:54.820 --> 21:56.720
I was trying to send you a message.

21:58.820 --> 22:01.820
What?
I have a boyfriend!

22:01.860 --> 22:02.860
A real one!

22:02.890 --> 22:04.730
Sorry, Chyna,

22:04.760 --> 22:06.760
you're going to have to cast someone
else to play your boyfriend.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.760
I just booked a zit cream commercial!

22:08.800 --> 22:10.700
I better start preparing for my role.

22:16.810 --> 22:19.670
So, what was I saying?

22:20.810 --> 22:23.910
I like that cologne you're wearing,

22:23.950 --> 22:25.750
but this is what I usually use.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.820
Lexi, this is Susan.
Susan, this is Paisley.

22:36.860 --> 22:37.930
Paisley, this is Becky.
Becky, this is Gabby.

22:37.960 --> 22:41.630
Gabby, this is Cindy.
Cindy, this is Debbie.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.000
Debbie, this is Emma.
Emma, this is Amy.

22:43.030 --> 22:45.730
Amy, this is Katie.
Katie, this is Zoe.

22:45.770 --> 22:47.740
Zoe, this is Julie.
Julie, this is Kerry.

22:47.770 --> 22:49.700
Kerry, this is Michelle.
Michelle, this is Lexi.

22:49.740 --> 22:50.740
Lexi, this is Amber.
Amber, this is Paisley.

22:52.810 --> 22:54.810
Nice to meet you, Paisley.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.780
No, you're Paisley.
This is...

22:57.810 --> 22:59.710
I'll just start again.

22:59.750 --> 23:01.850
Lexi, this is Susan.
Susan, this is Paisley.

23:01.880 --> 23:02.550
Paisley, have you met Becky?

23:02.580 --> 23:03.880
Becky, have you met Cindy?

23:03.920 --> 23:05.000
<i>Cindy, have you met Debbie?</i>

23:05.050 --> 23:06.840
<i>Debbie, have you met Emma?</i>
<i>Emma have you met...</i>
