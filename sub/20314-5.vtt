00:03.000 --> 00:06.208
-Okay, ah so right now we
have left a two dollar tip.

00:06.250 --> 00:08.458
-Awesome.
-Good.

00:08.500 --> 00:11.583
-No, not awesome. I know none
of you have worked in the
restaurant industry like I have

00:11.625 --> 00:14.750
but we have to leave
at least 15 percent.

00:14.792 --> 00:17.458
So we're going to have to
do this again, I'm going to
pass it around.

00:17.500 --> 00:21.875
Please put in what you owe,
add 15 percent and add tax.

00:21.917 --> 00:24.875
-Look, I just had a small salad
with easy dressing.

00:24.917 --> 00:28.041
-Easy dressing has nothing
to do with how much the
salad costs.

00:28.083 --> 00:30.250
Simon, I didn't even
see you put money in.

00:30.291 --> 00:34.583
-I just had the water. Easy ice.
-No, you ate half a plate
of nachos.

00:34.625 --> 00:36.792
-Emma ordered those.
-I got those to share.

00:36.834 --> 00:39.917
-I thought you were buying them.
-I was buying half of them.

00:39.959 --> 00:43.583
-And who had four margaritas?

00:43.625 --> 00:47.500
-That'd be me.
-Did you put in for
four margaritas?

00:47.542 --> 00:49.750
-No, I did not.

00:49.792 --> 00:53.667
I paid for two margaritas
because Bobbi ordered
me the other two.

00:53.709 --> 00:56.500
-No, no, no I ordered two,
but I didn't pay for two.

00:56.542 --> 01:00.417
-What the hell is that?
-At no time did I say,
I'm going to buy you a drink.

01:00.458 --> 01:03.667
I ordered you a drink,
I did not pay for it.

01:03.709 --> 01:05.792
-That's pathetic.

01:05.834 --> 01:10.458
-Okay Trudy, 'cause I saw you
put in $15 and then you took
out a 20.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.458
-Five dollar tip,
you're welcome.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.583
-Okay, waitress?

01:15.625 --> 01:18.041
Sorry, could we get separate
cheques please?

01:18.083 --> 01:20.875
Instead of one bill? Thank you.

be shadowing you this week.

01:37.625 --> 01:40.834
-Ms. Garland? Ah...Why?

01:40.875 --> 01:43.458
As I've already explained
to the entire staff.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.959
She's taking concurrent
education at university.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.250
This is part of the program.

01:48.291 --> 01:50.500
-You want to be a teacher.

01:50.542 --> 01:53.083
Well, she's already seen me
teach for three years, sir,
so why my class?

01:53.125 --> 01:55.750
-She's rotating classes,
you're up. Enjoy, Maya.

01:55.792 --> 01:57.875
-Thanks, Mike.

01:57.917 --> 02:00.250
-You can't call him
Mike, first of all.

02:00.291 --> 02:02.500
-He told me to.
-Well, he told me not to.

02:02.542 --> 02:04.792
-So, what's the plan?

02:04.834 --> 02:07.250
-Alright, you sit at the back
where I can't see you or
feel you.

02:07.291 --> 02:09.792
You observe, that means
you don't talk.

02:09.834 --> 02:11.792
You don't ask questions.
And you don't bug me

02:11.834 --> 02:14.000
like you did for the
past three years.

02:14.041 --> 02:16.333
-Got it. And I won't
correct you once.

02:16.375 --> 02:18.542
Like I did, everyday, for
the past three years.

02:18.583 --> 02:20.917
-No, don't do that either.
-Maya!

02:20.959 --> 02:23.166
-Hey Lori.
-Come sit beside me.

02:23.208 --> 02:25.333
-[Maya]: Yeah!
-Ignore her, everybody.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.083
-Hide your wallet.
-That's Graham. He's a
new student.

02:32.125 --> 02:34.291
-A student here?
-Yup.

02:34.333 --> 02:36.792
-Kind of rough around the
edges, don't you think?

02:36.834 --> 02:39.542
He looks so poor.
-That's the point, Robert.

02:39.583 --> 02:41.792
This is Callaghan's new
initiative.

02:41.834 --> 02:45.417
He's giving underprivileged
kids the opportunity to get a
private education.

02:45.458 --> 02:48.041
-The man's a saint.

02:48.083 --> 02:51.875
Graham, I'm vice principal
Robert Cheeley.

02:51.917 --> 02:53.875
It's nice to meet you.
-Hey.

02:53.917 --> 02:56.834
-Allow me to be the first to
welcome you aboard the
Xavier train.

02:56.875 --> 02:59.083
I'm going to punch your ticket.
-What?

02:59.125 --> 03:01.792
-To a first class education.
-Robert.

03:01.834 --> 03:04.333
-Uh huh?
-Just get him a uniform will ya?

03:04.375 --> 03:06.583
-Graham? Right this way.

03:08.375 --> 03:10.875
-I think you just have to
be really up front with men.

03:10.917 --> 03:13.333
There's nothing wrong with
knowing what you want and
going after it.

03:13.375 --> 03:16.750
-Give me a break.
-Gerry, do you have something
to add to our conversation?

03:16.792 --> 03:20.291
-Yeah, well, you're getting
dating advice from a child?
-I'm nineteen.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.875
-You know what the
word teen stands for?
Teenager.

03:22.917 --> 03:27.000
-Y'know, out of the three of us,
she's the only one in a
relationship.

03:27.041 --> 03:30.375
-I'm nineteen, I'm in a
relationship. We go
to the movies.

03:30.417 --> 03:32.583
Teenagers aren't
in relationships.

03:32.625 --> 03:35.834
-I'm not dating a teenager.
I'm actually dating someone
a lot older.

03:35.875 --> 03:38.542
-Really?
-How old is a lot older for you?

03:38.583 --> 03:40.834
-Why do you care?

03:40.875 --> 03:43.500
-'Cause if there's a possible
child predator lurking, I tend
to care, Maya.

03:43.542 --> 03:45.792
-Gerry, leave her alone.
-He's 33.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.083
-How old?
-[Lisa]: Wow. That is older.

03:48.125 --> 03:52.625
Leave some for the rest of us.
It's totally your prerogative.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.834
-Do you know what a 33 year
old wants from you Maya?

03:54.875 --> 03:58.375
Do you know? And I have a
pretty good idea what I'll be
like when I'm 33.

03:58.417 --> 04:01.542
So, I know what that guy's
thinking. Does he go to
Thailand?

04:01.583 --> 04:03.750
Does he hang out in Thailand?
Does he do that?

04:03.792 --> 04:06.208
You might want to check on that.
Have you told your parents?

04:06.250 --> 04:09.542
-I'm an adult now. I don't have
to tell my parents everything.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.834
-You're an adult.

04:11.875 --> 04:14.917
-That's true. You know, I dated
an older guy once.

04:14.959 --> 04:19.667
-No, Lisa. You've dated once.
An older guy.

04:19.709 --> 04:21.875
Big difference.

04:21.917 --> 04:23.709
-Thanks Dad.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.834
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Did
you guys get rid of the lice?

04:29.875 --> 04:32.166
-Yes, Bobbi.
-Okay, you can sit.

04:32.208 --> 04:35.834
-What a horrible experience.
-Ugh, thank god for Mr. Malik.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.291
His olive oil treatment
saved my hair.

04:38.333 --> 04:41.709
-He is the lice whisperer.
-Oh, it just creeps me out.

04:41.750 --> 04:45.667
I'm just glad I didn't get it.
It's still floating around
the school though.

04:45.709 --> 04:48.250
-Okay, what?
-What are you doing Boobi?

04:48.291 --> 04:50.959
-I just don't want to get lice.
And you have a lot...

04:51.000 --> 04:54.041
You know, of that hair.
You've been exposed to it.

04:54.083 --> 04:56.375
-I understand the lice, Boobi.

04:56.417 --> 04:59.000
My kids had lice. You
know why you don't have them?

04:59.041 --> 05:02.291
-Probably 'cause I'm very clean.
I condition, daily.

05:02.333 --> 05:05.792
Not saying that you
are not clean.

05:05.834 --> 05:08.875
I'm just more clean. I'm not
saying that you're dirty. Okay?

05:08.917 --> 05:10.834
-I think you just did.

05:10.875 --> 05:13.333
You did not get the lice,
because you are like a man.

05:13.375 --> 05:16.667
-Excuse me?
-Lice is not attracted
to testosterone.

05:16.709 --> 05:19.959
So, like me, you must have
high levels in your body.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
-[Quietly]: Okay.
-You will probably never get it,
because...

05:25.166 --> 05:29.250
You are like this.
-[Trudy laughs]

05:29.291 --> 05:32.125
-What's so funny?
-Nothing Sir, sorry.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.875
-Maya, can I speak
to you please.

05:37.917 --> 05:39.792
-Just one second, Gerry.

05:42.959 --> 05:45.458
[Maya]: I'll see you at lunch.

05:45.500 --> 05:49.125
-Alright, first of all, in front
of the students you call me
Mr. Duncan, not Gerry.

05:49.166 --> 05:52.000
-Then I'm Ms. Garland.
-Oh yeah, I forgot you're
all grown up now.

05:52.041 --> 05:54.375
Well, welcome to adult world.
Guess what.

05:54.417 --> 05:56.667
Those aren't your friends
anymore. They're your enemies.

05:56.709 --> 05:58.959
-My enemies? Why?

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
-Because, there's a line
between student and teacher
that we can't cross.

06:02.041 --> 06:04.500
-So I can't talk to my friends?
-You're not listening.

06:04.542 --> 06:06.750
You have no more
friends here anymore.

06:06.792 --> 06:09.166
Do you understand that?
That is gone for you.

06:09.208 --> 06:12.667
And you have to establish that
early in your teaching career.

06:12.709 --> 06:16.250
They are not your friends.
You are their boss.

06:16.291 --> 06:21.917
Now, to test that, go into
my class, find a student and
rip a strip off them.

06:21.959 --> 06:24.667
-For what?
-No reason. Make up a reason.

06:24.709 --> 06:27.000
I don't care, but show
them you're a teacher.

06:27.041 --> 06:30.875
-I can't do that.
-You see? That's the difference
between kids and adults.

06:30.917 --> 06:34.041
Adults do their job.
-[Maya takes a deep breath]

06:34.083 --> 06:36.875
Fine.
-Good luck.

06:48.333 --> 06:51.125
-Are you chewing gum?
-Yes.

06:51.166 --> 06:53.291
-Are you supposed to
be chewing gum?
-[Tammy]: No.

06:53.333 --> 06:55.917
-What's so interesting
about the floor?

06:55.959 --> 06:58.083
Look at me when
I'm talking to you.

06:58.125 --> 07:00.875
-[Tammy]: I was just...
-[Maya]: You were just screwing
up.

07:00.917 --> 07:04.917
I better not have this
conversation with you again.
Understood?

07:04.959 --> 07:08.625
-Yes, Miss.
-Good.

07:08.667 --> 07:10.750
Gum.

07:16.333 --> 07:19.291
Happy?
-Welcome to teaching.

07:19.333 --> 07:23.166
She hates you.
And that's gross.

07:23.208 --> 07:25.625
-Well, it looks as though
Graham's fitting in.

07:25.667 --> 07:28.208
-Haha, not fitting into
his pants apparently.

07:28.250 --> 07:31.000
Don't worry El Capitain,
I'll handle it.

07:31.041 --> 07:34.000
-No, let's cut him some slack.
This is a big change for Graham.

07:34.041 --> 07:36.000
-Doesn't mean the
rules don't apply.

07:36.041 --> 07:39.041
-No, but we can give him a
couple of days to settle in,
okay?

07:39.083 --> 07:40.959
-Okay.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.083
Ah, the tie Graham,
is kind of the centrepiece
of the entire Xavier uniform.

07:48.125 --> 07:51.083
Some would say it even, kind of,
ties the whole thing together.

07:51.125 --> 07:53.709
-Who might say that?
- Well, I just did.

07:53.750 --> 07:56.500
-Yeah, ya did.
[Laughs]

07:56.542 --> 08:00.208
-So, tie.
-It's the centrepiece.

08:00.250 --> 08:02.250
I got it.

08:02.291 --> 08:04.458
-Cool.

08:06.083 --> 08:08.709
-[Door closes]

08:08.750 --> 08:12.375
-Oh god Bill, please go
upstairs. We've talked
about this.

08:12.417 --> 08:14.875
[Gerry sighs]
-What are you doing
home so early?

08:14.917 --> 08:17.041
I thought you had practice.
-It got cancelled.

08:17.083 --> 08:20.166
Can you take your date upstairs
so I can watch TV?

08:20.208 --> 08:22.792
Can you pass me the remote
please? Come on Bill.

08:22.834 --> 08:24.834
Bill!

-Hi Gerry.

throw up here, guys.

-See ya tomorrow, Gerry.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.375
[Door closes]

08:44.834 --> 08:46.583
-Unbelievable.
-What?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.208
-What do you mean what? You
can't date one of my students.

08:50.250 --> 08:52.500
-Was one of your students.
-Doesn't matter.

08:52.542 --> 08:54.750
Once a student, always a
student. She's off limits Bill.

08:54.792 --> 08:57.000
-Yeah, I mean if you dated
her, it would be weird.

08:57.041 --> 08:59.875
-Roommates too, you can't date
any of my former students.
They're off limits.

08:59.917 --> 09:02.083
-See this is why I didn't tell
you about this.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.333
'Cause I knew you'd make
a whole big deal of it.
-Big deal of it?

09:04.375 --> 09:06.667
She's a child, Bill.
-She's nineteen.

09:06.709 --> 09:09.875
-Exactly.
-I've dated 19 year olds before
and you thought it was great.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.250
-I never taught them.
-I didn't teach Maya.

09:12.291 --> 09:14.834
-You gotta end it, so that's it,
you gotta end it right now.

09:14.875 --> 09:17.083
-I'm sorry, but I really
like this one.

09:17.125 --> 09:19.041
-I thought you really liked
this one.

09:19.083 --> 09:21.375
-Okay, this conversation's
taking a weird turn.

09:21.417 --> 09:24.417
-Either she goes or I go.
End of story.

09:26.208 --> 09:29.375
-See ya.
-You're choosing her over me?

09:29.417 --> 09:31.959
-Yeah, I am.

-What now?
-[Robert]: What now?

09:40.125 --> 09:42.583
Look, I know what it's like
to be the new guy.

09:42.625 --> 09:45.583
There's a lot of pressure to
fit in, well you want my advice?

09:45.625 --> 09:47.917
You want to fit in?
Just follow the rules.

09:47.959 --> 09:50.625
It's so much easier that way.
-You know what would make
my life easier?

09:50.667 --> 09:53.125
For you to get out of my face.

09:53.166 --> 09:56.417
-I'm just trying to give you a
bit of lee-way 'cause I know
it's important to Mr. Callaghan.

So, help me, help you.

treatment? Would you grow up?

10:30.625 --> 10:35.166
-Actually Maya, I think
the problem here is that
you need to grow up

10:35.208 --> 10:37.291
before you start dating someone
in their mid-thirties.

10:37.333 --> 10:40.125
-When are you going to accept
the fact that I'm a grown woman?

10:40.166 --> 10:42.542
-Because I've taught you.
Do you see how that works?

10:42.583 --> 10:44.750
I taught you when you were 15.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.959
So to me, you're always my
student. That'll never change.

10:47.041 --> 10:49.166
When I'm 80 and you're
70 you're still my student.

10:49.208 --> 10:52.291
It doesn't matter, that's how
it works. Maybe you'll
understand that as a teacher.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.333
And that's why I care about you.

10:54.375 --> 10:56.625
That's why I'm so invested in
this and trying to help you.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.834
And that's why right now,
you disgust me.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.000
-Well, I'm sorry, but who I date
is not up to you.

11:01.041 --> 11:03.291
-Well, plant this in your
little head.

11:03.333 --> 11:06.583
You should know you're
going to be planning Bill's
40th very soon.

11:06.625 --> 11:10.583
-Isn't that just a few years
after you plan yours?

11:10.625 --> 11:13.125
-Maybe I can set you up with
one of the boys in this class.

11:13.166 --> 11:15.166
It's the same thing, right?
No, it's worse actually.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.166
'Cause Bill dating you, is
like you dating a five year old.

11:18.208 --> 11:20.417
-It is not the same
and you know it.

11:20.458 --> 11:23.792
-Hey, Maya.
-Ms. Garland to you Alex.

11:23.834 --> 11:27.625
-Hey, maybe...ah...maybe Alex
can be your new man.

11:27.667 --> 11:29.875
-Really?
-Sit down Alex.

11:29.917 --> 11:32.166
You see how ridiculous
that sounds?

Ra, ra, ra, ra, ra.

12:08.041 --> 12:10.709

12:23.625 --> 12:28.125
-So, let me get this straight,
G, you think I don't get you?
-Nope.

12:28.166 --> 12:31.542
-Well this might come as a bit
of a surprise to you, but this

12:31.583 --> 12:35.250
homie over here used to be
a pretty bad apple.

12:35.291 --> 12:38.417
-What are you telling me?
-What am I telling you, dog?

12:38.458 --> 12:41.333
What'chu hearing bro?
Y'na what I mean?

12:41.375 --> 12:44.792
Now I'm like, if I want to beat
the man I better dress like that
hustler G.

12:44.834 --> 12:48.625
Nome sayin'? That's what's real.
You better start dressing like a
baller.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.917
Boom!

12:50.959 --> 12:53.792
-So, you're a baller?
-That's right, y'man.

12:53.834 --> 12:56.000
Y'know what I mean?
I used to dress like you.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.208
Nome sayin'.
Like a little bitch.

12:58.250 --> 13:01.959
Then I was like, hang on a
second dog, problem with
the threads that you sport

13:02.000 --> 13:07.959
when people see you, they like,
who dat light, weak-ass, white
boy.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.959
When people see me, they like,
dang! That's some type a shit.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.208
-That makes sense.
-That's right.

13:15.250 --> 13:17.709
So why you all up in my grill
for 'den? Y'know what I mean?

13:17.750 --> 13:19.917
You best back up!

13:19.959 --> 13:22.667
-So, you dress they way you do,
to hide what you're really
doing?

13:22.709 --> 13:24.875
-What'chu think I'm doin' thug?

13:26.500 --> 13:29.333

-Exactly, 'cause it's workin'.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.458
-Sure am Truders.

13:46.500 --> 13:49.375
What do you think shorty
means by cupcakes?

13:49.417 --> 13:53.792
It's code for Candy.
Rhymes with rugs. Feel me?

13:53.834 --> 13:56.083
-I feel you.

Sorry, woman talk?

14:29.500 --> 14:32.041
-Maya was just telling me how
great things are going.

14:32.083 --> 14:34.375
-We're checking out that
new burger place tonight.

14:34.417 --> 14:36.959
-So, you're okay with this Lisa?
-[Lisa]: Of course I am.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.166
You know, Maya's right,
you need to let this go.

14:39.208 --> 14:41.417
-You have no problem
at all with this scenario?

14:41.458 --> 14:45.166
-No. There is nothing wrong with
a woman dating an older man.

14:45.208 --> 14:48.583
-Just checking. Because...
[does a drumroll]

14:48.625 --> 14:50.458
She's dating Bill!

14:52.041 --> 14:55.917
-Your Bill?
-I would say in this situation
we're talking about your Bill.

14:55.959 --> 14:58.208
Probably a little
more applicable.

14:58.250 --> 15:01.041
But, none of my business.
I'm getting out of here.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.583
Sorry to interrupt.
As you were.

-Did you two...ever...
-Yeah, quite a bit.

-There they are.
-I thought you said he
wasn't going to be here.

15:30.667 --> 15:32.792

15:33.917 --> 15:37.500
What are the odds of this?
Ha!

[Gerry]: Hey guys.
-What the hell are
you doing here?

15:40.417 --> 15:42.583
-Better question, what the
hell are you doing here?

15:44.542 --> 15:48.208
-Yeah. What I'm not allowed to
take a student out for a burger
after school?

15:48.250 --> 15:50.458
-Are you allowed to take a
student out for a burger after
school?

15:50.500 --> 15:53.375
-Yeah...If you tell their
parents they need extra help.

15:53.417 --> 15:57.625
-And I don't have to be home
until nine, so let's get this
party started.

15:57.667 --> 16:00.417
Hey Maya.
-Ms. Garland to you, Alex.

16:00.458 --> 16:03.792
-So that's how you
want to play it?

16:03.834 --> 16:06.000
-[Whispers]: Bit much.

16:06.041 --> 16:08.333
-What are you doing?
This isn't funny.

16:08.375 --> 16:10.583
-It's not meant to be funny.

16:10.625 --> 16:13.709
I want to show you that the age
difference between them is
actually very similar to this.

16:13.750 --> 16:16.000
And that's...Them dating is
like you dating.

16:16.041 --> 16:18.333
-It's not the same thing Gerry.
-It's not the same at all.

16:18.375 --> 16:22.208
He could be our son. Look at us
Gerry, we're a happy little
family.

16:22.250 --> 16:25.542
-What?
-No, I'm just...I'm
making a point.

16:25.583 --> 16:30.375
I see what you're doing and it's
not going to work because we
are two consenting adults.

16:30.417 --> 16:35.333
You gotta get it in your head,
it's not up to you if we're
dating or we move in together.

16:35.375 --> 16:38.125
-You two are moving in together?
-What are you talking about?

16:38.166 --> 16:40.333
-It's just, like,
a hypothetical.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.625
I'll see you at home.

16:42.667 --> 16:45.458
-I got this.
-Thank you, Alex.

16:46.667 --> 16:49.083
-I don't have any money.

16:49.125 --> 16:52.417
-Then why'd you say, I got this?
-I got caught up in the moment.

16:52.458 --> 16:55.208
-Put the bill back on the table.
-Okay.

16:55.250 --> 16:56.667
-Walk away.

16:57.625 --> 17:01.333
Changed his mind. My date
changed his mind.

17:05.583 --> 17:07.750
-Well? Hmm?

17:10.750 --> 17:13.083
-Boobi?
-Mmm? Yeah?

17:13.125 --> 17:15.333
-What are you wearing?
-Oh this?

17:15.375 --> 17:18.458
Nothing, it's just...It's what
I always wear when I go out.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.917
So, I think it's pretty obvious
that the lice were wrong.

17:20.959 --> 17:24.875
-Don't blame the lice, Boobi.
Lice do not judge.

17:24.917 --> 17:27.709
-Okay, all I'm saying...

17:27.750 --> 17:30.041
Here. Yup.

17:30.083 --> 17:34.959
All I'm saying is that I'm not
going to let a bunch of lice
tell me that I'm not a woman.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.041
Got it?

17:39.750 --> 17:41.625

blow his cover somehow.

18:15.917 --> 18:18.125
So why do we need a narc here?

18:18.166 --> 18:21.542

is selling marijuana on the
