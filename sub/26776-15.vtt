- Well now we're definitely
going to burn it.

10:02.168 --> 10:05.271
- No, no, no...
- What a terrible idea.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.440
- Stop!

10:07.506 --> 10:10.676
That vacuum is gold.

10:10.743 --> 10:13.245
Pure internet gold.

10:13.312 --> 10:14.413
You get me?

10:14.480 --> 10:18.451
- Whaaaaaat are you
talking about?

10:18.517 --> 10:22.288
- I'm talking about hiring
a ghost hunter to come here,

10:22.355 --> 10:26.025
and then recording them yanking
the ghost out of the vacuum.

10:26.092 --> 10:29.128
- Ummm...
- Yeah, ummmm...

10:29.195 --> 10:32.365
- We'll have the first proof
that ghosts exist.

10:32.431 --> 10:33.933
We put that up on the web...

10:34.000 --> 10:35.901
- We'll be famous...

10:35.968 --> 10:37.937
- We'll be better than famous.

10:38.004 --> 10:40.973
We will be internet famous.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.943
And that is the longest-lasting
fame that there is.

10:44.010 --> 10:47.980
- I'll finally be able
to quit my new job...

10:48.047 --> 10:50.282
- I'll look up local
ghost hunters right now.

10:50.349 --> 10:51.384
I'm sure there's plenty.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.486
- Or, or, or...

10:53.552 --> 10:56.455
orrrr...or....

10:56.522 --> 10:57.757
- Or what?

10:57.823 --> 11:00.326
- If you just let me finish...

11:00.393 --> 11:02.628
Orrrr...

11:02.695 --> 11:04.997
we could call my boss.

11:05.064 --> 11:06.832
- Why would we call your boss?

11:06.899 --> 11:08.667
- Is he a ghost hunter?
- Yep.

11:08.734 --> 11:10.436
- Is he?
- YEP.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.338
- Well, I don't see him
listed on this website

11:12.405 --> 11:14.073
of licensed Swellview
ghost hunters.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.008
- Well, that's because
he's an amateur.

11:16.075 --> 11:17.176
You know?
So he'll do it for free.

11:17.243 --> 11:18.344
You know?
For the experience.

11:18.411 --> 11:22.181
- Free? Daddy like.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.850
- Fine.
Just get him over here.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.352
- Yeah, I'm calling
him right now

11:26.419 --> 11:28.821
don't tell me how
to live my life, Piper. Okay?

11:31.023 --> 11:35.194
Hey, ghost?
What's it like being dead?

11:35.261 --> 11:37.296
- It's...fine?

11:37.363 --> 11:41.033
- I knew it!

11:41.100 --> 11:43.836
- C'mon, Ray...
pick up pick up...

11:43.903 --> 11:46.372
[ phone rings ]

11:46.439 --> 11:47.807
- Rayyyy-llo?

11:47.873 --> 11:50.876
- Okay...
um...

11:50.943 --> 11:52.144
I need you to come
over to my house,

11:52.211 --> 11:53.179
pretend to be a ghost hunter,

11:53.245 --> 11:54.880
so you can distract my family,

11:54.947 --> 11:56.782
and then I can get Charlotte
out of Schwoz's vacuum.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.017
- Is your--

11:58.084 --> 11:59.218
- Yes, my mom is here.

11:59.285 --> 12:00.486
- See you soon!

12:00.553 --> 12:02.555
- Wait wait wait,
lemme talk to Schwoz!

12:02.621 --> 12:06.125
- Schwoz!

12:06.192 --> 12:07.893
And I need you to blast me
to Henry's house.

12:07.960 --> 12:08.894
- Hello? Schwoz?

12:08.961 --> 12:11.063
- Schwozzzup, Henry?

12:11.130 --> 12:13.399
- Hey umm, I accidentally
sucked Charlotte

12:13.466 --> 12:14.733
into your vacuum.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.670
- Just hit the "Unsuck" button.
No biggie.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.705
- Jasper and I smashed it.

12:19.772 --> 12:21.373
- Oof, that's a biggie.

12:23.209 --> 12:24.677
- Yeah, can you come over
to my house and fix it?

12:24.743 --> 12:28.013
- Yah, yah, yah, just scoop up
all the smashied bits

12:28.080 --> 12:29.982
from the vacuum,
bring them to your bedroom

12:30.049 --> 12:31.517
and I'll meet you there.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.586
- Okay, okay, cool.
Is Ray on his way yet?

12:33.652 --> 12:36.088
- Oh yah yahhh.

12:39.325 --> 12:41.594
He should be there
by the time I finish

12:41.660 --> 12:44.497
thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiissss...

12:44.563 --> 12:45.664
- Ha ha ha!

12:45.731 --> 12:47.099
Caaaaaatch meeeeeee...

12:47.166 --> 12:48.834
- Ahh!

12:55.908 --> 12:59.612
- Would it have killed
you to catch me?

12:59.678 --> 13:02.581
- Yes.

13:02.648 --> 13:04.250
- Yeah you're probably right...

13:16.862 --> 13:18.397
- Okay, attention
spans are short--

13:18.464 --> 13:21.100
so I want that ghost
outta that suck box in five.

13:22.501 --> 13:24.703
- Henry, get over here
and participate.

13:24.770 --> 13:26.972
- Uh yea I'm just, you know,
I'm still cleaning up...

13:27.039 --> 13:29.208
remember The Chore Wheel?

13:29.275 --> 13:31.777
- Oh wow, was that today?

13:31.844 --> 13:33.445
- Yeah Mom,

13:33.512 --> 13:36.649
and um I just got
to dump these vacuum parts

13:36.715 --> 13:38.250
in the upstairs trash can

13:38.317 --> 13:40.452
it's my favorite one
don't ask questions bye...

13:42.821 --> 13:46.592
- I'm picking up a message...

13:46.659 --> 13:48.460
the ghost says that...

13:48.527 --> 13:50.563
Henry's Mom should
switch seats with her husband

13:50.629 --> 13:52.431
and sit next to me.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.600
- Go, honey!

13:54.667 --> 13:58.270
Charlotte: Uhhhh, no,
I did not say that.

13:58.337 --> 14:01.507
- Oh well then uh it must
have been a different ghost.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.342
- So there's more
than one ghost in there?

14:03.409 --> 14:05.978
- ...sure.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.813
Let's, uh, hear
from a different ghost.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.082
- Okay, I'm a...

14:10.149 --> 14:12.418
different ghost...

14:12.484 --> 14:14.086
what's up?

14:15.888 --> 14:17.356
- This guy's legit.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.697
- Schwoz? Where are you?
Are you--

14:24.763 --> 14:26.165
Ahh!

14:26.232 --> 14:27.700
- You got the smashee piece-ees?

14:27.766 --> 14:29.368
- Is that my dad's robe?

14:29.435 --> 14:31.837
- I got bored
and took a shower.

14:31.904 --> 14:33.839
- What if my parents saw you?!

14:33.906 --> 14:37.543
- That would have
been hilarious.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.144
- Just...

14:39.211 --> 14:40.713
here are your
smashee piece-ees.

14:40.779 --> 14:41.714
- Oof.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.716
I'm gonna need some tools.

14:43.782 --> 14:45.351
- Tools? Um okay,

14:45.417 --> 14:46.685
I guess I can sneak
into my garage

14:46.752 --> 14:47.987
and get my dad's tool box--

14:48.053 --> 14:51.223
- Relax, I got it.

14:51.290 --> 14:53.459
- Schwoz, did you hide
your toolbox in my bedroom?!

14:53.525 --> 14:55.961
- Do you want me
to answer that question,

14:56.028 --> 14:58.564
or do you want me
to fix the vacuum?

14:58.631 --> 15:00.065
- Both, Schwoz!

15:02.801 --> 15:04.403
- Ahhh.....

15:04.470 --> 15:06.905
Yes...yes...

15:06.972 --> 15:08.974
the spirits
definitely want you

15:09.041 --> 15:11.810
to keep giving me
a hand massage.

15:11.877 --> 15:14.213
- Fascinating.

15:14.280 --> 15:17.349
- Are there any ghosts
from Japan in there?

15:17.416 --> 15:20.252
- I can get you a ghost
from any city you want, darlin'.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.554
- I don't think you can...

15:22.621 --> 15:26.725
- Uh, I'd like to hear
from the Japanese ghost.

15:26.792 --> 15:27.893
Charlotte: [ sighs ]

15:27.960 --> 15:30.596
Konichiwa.

15:30.663 --> 15:31.997
- Okay, enough!

15:32.064 --> 15:34.767
We're not paying you
to talk to ghosts.

15:34.833 --> 15:37.403
- You're not paying me at all.

15:37.469 --> 15:39.371
- Look! I'm gonna
hit record again,

15:39.438 --> 15:40.773
but this time
I want to see you

15:40.839 --> 15:44.076
rip one of those ghosts
right out of that vacuum.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.411
Ya got me?

15:45.477 --> 15:47.513
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
in a couple minutes.

15:47.579 --> 15:48.947
In the meantime...

15:49.014 --> 15:53.052
Who wants to hear from
Jamaican superstar Sean Paul?

15:53.118 --> 15:55.254
- Uh, dude...

15:55.321 --> 15:58.090
- I'mmmmm...
not actually dead yet, mon.

15:58.157 --> 16:01.560
- Yeah, he's still alive.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.761
- Huh...

16:05.497 --> 16:07.266
- Dude, did you hide anything
else in my room, dude?

16:07.333 --> 16:10.469
- Why would I only
hide one thing?

16:12.705 --> 16:13.639
- Schwoz, are you close?!

16:13.706 --> 16:14.907
Ray is dying down there

16:14.973 --> 16:16.742
and Charlotte is
running out of ghost voices.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.778
Charlotte: Yeehaw!
I'm Janey, the dead cowgirl!

16:19.845 --> 16:21.313
You can't see me,

16:21.380 --> 16:24.983
but I'm a riding a pretty
ghost pony, y'all.

16:25.050 --> 16:27.486
- Wait--Janey the cowgirl's
not dead.

16:27.553 --> 16:30.222
- Just--did you fix
the vacuum piece or not!?

16:30.289 --> 16:31.490
- Yah yah yah.
It's finished, here.

16:31.557 --> 16:32.591
- Yeah, yeah okay.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.659
- Now, go downstairs,

16:33.726 --> 16:35.260
and when no one is
looking, you---

16:35.327 --> 16:36.762
- Ow, this thing's getting
kinda hot, dude...

16:36.829 --> 16:38.831
- Yah, the piece-ees
were too smashied for me

16:38.897 --> 16:40.332
to fix the cooling system.

16:40.399 --> 16:44.269
- What? Wait, so it's gonna get
hotter than this?

16:44.336 --> 16:46.271
- Yah, and eventually
it will melt or catch fire

16:46.338 --> 16:48.173
and Charlotte will be
stuck in that vacuum

16:48.240 --> 16:50.142
until I can order
a new part from China.

16:50.209 --> 16:52.678
- What?! How much
time do we have?

16:52.745 --> 16:54.446
- Like, four minutes,

16:54.513 --> 16:56.648
unless you drop it
on the ground or something.

16:56.715 --> 16:59.318
- Too hot!

16:59.385 --> 17:02.654
- You have two minutes.

17:10.229 --> 17:11.630
- What are you doing?

17:11.696 --> 17:13.699
Stop playing
taco taco turkey

17:13.766 --> 17:15.701
and put that back
on the vacuum downstairs.

17:15.768 --> 17:19.637
- Yeah well, how are we supposed
to when it's so hot?!

17:19.704 --> 17:21.272
- Wait no no no, dude!
Don't put it on my bed!

17:21.339 --> 17:22.875
- It's too hot.
- You can't just put it...

17:22.941 --> 17:25.810
- How about you touch it...
- You're gonna catch it...

17:25.877 --> 17:27.479
- It's a very nice duvet.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.014
Very comfortable to sleep on.

17:29.081 --> 17:31.116
- Just use these oven mitts!

17:34.453 --> 17:36.355
- How many things do you have
hidden in my room, dude?

17:36.422 --> 17:39.525
- Wouldn't
you like to know...

17:39.591 --> 17:42.127
- YES.

17:46.064 --> 17:48.000
- You only have
90 seconds left

17:48.066 --> 17:49.501
before that part melts

17:49.568 --> 17:52.404
and Charlotte is stuck
in that vacuum for 4-6 weeks

17:52.471 --> 17:54.973
while I wait for the part
to arrive from China.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.542
- A soda fountain?

17:56.608 --> 17:58.243
Dude, that takes
pipes and plumbing

17:58.310 --> 17:59.578
and when did you do all this?!

17:59.645 --> 18:02.748
- 85...84...

18:02.815 --> 18:04.216
83...

18:04.283 --> 18:05.751
- Let's go!

18:05.818 --> 18:06.952
- Ahhhh!

18:12.090 --> 18:13.725
- [ laughs ]

18:13.792 --> 18:15.027
- So what you're saying,

18:15.093 --> 18:17.429
ghost of William Shakespeare...

18:17.496 --> 18:20.499
is that writers are garbage,

18:20.566 --> 18:22.601
and actors are the real heroes.

18:22.668 --> 18:25.237
Charlotte: Yes, actors
are the real heroes.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.005
- Truest word I've ever heard.

18:27.072 --> 18:29.041
- Far superior.

18:29.107 --> 18:32.344
- Dude, they're too close
to the super sucker.

18:32.411 --> 18:34.246
How am I supposed to get
this thing on the vacuum

18:34.313 --> 18:35.681
without anybody seeing me?

18:35.747 --> 18:37.349
- I have a plan to make them
close their eyes.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.017
- Don't take your pants off.

18:39.084 --> 18:42.354
- Okay I have another plan to
make them to close their eyes.

18:42.421 --> 18:43.922
EVERYBODY CLOSE YOUR EYES!

18:43.989 --> 18:44.957
- What are you doing--

18:45.023 --> 18:46.692
- CLOSE YOUR EYES,

18:46.758 --> 18:48.427
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU CLOSE
YOUR EYES! CLOSE YOUR EYES!

18:48.494 --> 18:49.695
LISTEN TO ME!
BUT DON'T LOOK AT ME

18:49.761 --> 18:52.598
BECAUSE YOUR EYES
SHOULD BE CLOSED!

18:52.664 --> 18:55.033
- What are you talking about?

18:55.100 --> 18:56.568
- Umm...

18:56.635 --> 18:59.371
- No, Jasper's right!
Everybody close your eyes!

18:59.438 --> 19:00.539
The ghost is about
ready to come out.

19:00.606 --> 19:03.242
- Which one?
William Shakespeare?

19:03.308 --> 19:04.710
Janey the cowgirl?

19:04.776 --> 19:06.645
The Japanese ghost that
could only say "konichiwa?"

19:06.712 --> 19:09.481
- Yeah, I thought she'd be
able to say more than that.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.416
- Just--everybody
close your eyes!

19:11.483 --> 19:13.285
- I don't wanna close my eyes.

19:13.352 --> 19:15.988
I want to see
the ghost come out.

19:16.054 --> 19:17.155
- If you don't close your eyes

19:17.222 --> 19:19.124
the ghost will steal your soul!

19:19.191 --> 19:20.626
- No way...

19:20.692 --> 19:22.728
- YES WAY I WILL STEAL YOUR SOUL

19:22.794 --> 19:24.129
NOW JUST CLOSE
YOUR DANG EYES, PIPER!

19:24.196 --> 19:25.831
- It knows my name!

19:25.898 --> 19:28.734
- I ALSO KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE
NOW CLOSE YOUR DANG EYES!

19:31.003 --> 19:32.137
- Okay...

19:32.204 --> 19:34.506
now everybody keep
your eyes shut

19:34.573 --> 19:37.943
until I tell you
to open them.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.678
- That's right keep em, closed!

19:42.214 --> 19:43.849
- What was that?!

19:43.916 --> 19:45.317
- Ahhh!

19:45.384 --> 19:47.352
- It's the ghost!
I'm bringing it out now.

19:47.419 --> 19:49.087
Everybody keep your eyes closed

19:49.154 --> 19:51.690
until I tell you to open them.

19:51.757 --> 19:54.293
[ air hissing ]

19:54.359 --> 19:57.429
[ all screaming ]

20:04.369 --> 20:06.038
Don't open your eyes!!!

20:32.130 --> 20:33.365
Nobody open your eyes,

20:33.432 --> 20:35.434
there could still
be more ghosts in there!

20:47.112 --> 20:48.380
[ machine humming ]

20:48.447 --> 20:51.416
- Oh god no!

20:51.483 --> 20:52.818
[ machine humming ]

20:52.884 --> 20:54.720
- And three...

20:54.786 --> 20:56.088
two...

20:56.154 --> 20:57.756
one...

21:10.102 --> 21:11.336
- Is it over?

21:11.403 --> 21:14.673
- Are the ghosts gone?

21:14.740 --> 21:17.442
- What happened to my phone?!?!

21:17.509 --> 21:19.244
- Those are all...

21:19.311 --> 21:22.848
great questions.

21:22.914 --> 21:25.917
But I am actually late
for my next...

21:25.984 --> 21:30.255
ghost thingy so...

21:30.322 --> 21:34.593
This house is clean.

21:38.997 --> 21:43.301
- Uh...the ghosts are gone.
That's gooood.

21:43.368 --> 21:44.970
- No it's not!

21:45.037 --> 21:46.538
My phone is fried

21:46.605 --> 21:48.540
so I don't even have
any video of the ghosts!!!

21:48.607 --> 21:52.811
- And the house is
dirtier than it was before.

21:52.878 --> 21:56.148
Who's gonna clean this up?

21:56.214 --> 21:59.484
- I invoke the Chore Wheel!

21:59.551 --> 22:00.952
[ all gasp ]

22:01.019 --> 22:03.555
- Dad--you fool!
