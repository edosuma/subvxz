07:09.069 --> 07:12.209
team rider in Europe.

07:12.220 --> 07:15.029
When I was 18,

07:12.220 --> 07:15.029
I went to University.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.209
I was the Portuguese champion.

07:16.220 --> 07:20.019

07:16.220 --> 07:20.019

07:20.029 --> 07:22.040
Bruno actually

07:20.029 --> 07:22.040
beat Kelly Slater once.

07:22.050 --> 07:24.170
-Oh really?

07:22.050 --> 07:24.170
-You beat Kelly Slater?

07:24.180 --> 07:27.040
You know what I say to that?

07:24.180 --> 07:27.040
Shaka brah!

07:27.050 --> 07:28.170
Shaka ya ya.

07:28.180 --> 07:29.279
By the way, do you still surf?

07:29.290 --> 07:31.259
That's kind of the reason

07:29.290 --> 07:31.259
of my life.

07:31.269 --> 07:35.180
I work, then I want--

07:31.269 --> 07:35.180
we want to go surfing.

07:35.189 --> 07:37.000
-You surf too!

07:35.189 --> 07:37.000
-Yes.

07:37.009 --> 07:39.009
That is also part of

07:37.009 --> 07:39.009
the connection.

07:39.170 --> 07:41.029
It's handy that your wife

07:41.040 --> 07:43.000
-likes the same stuff.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.000
-It is handy.

07:43.009 --> 07:45.000
Dr. Dubrow and I, you know,

07:43.009 --> 07:45.000
we have our own hobbies

07:45.009 --> 07:47.060
together and that's

07:45.009 --> 07:47.060
basically him insulting me

07:47.069 --> 07:49.250
and me just kind of letting it

07:47.069 --> 07:49.250
go in one ear, out the other.

07:49.259 --> 07:51.199
I don't know if we wanna

07:49.259 --> 07:51.199
consider that a hobby.

07:51.209 --> 07:53.149
-But that's one.

07:51.209 --> 07:53.149
-Do you usually wear a wetsuit?

07:53.159 --> 07:57.079
Almost always. Because if not,

07:53.159 --> 07:57.079
it gets worse much faster.

07:57.090 --> 08:00.009
Because the bumps, they get

07:57.090 --> 08:00.009
bruised and start hurting.

08:00.019 --> 08:02.129
And at night I cannot

08:00.019 --> 08:02.129
lay down on my stomach.

08:02.139 --> 08:04.220
Becomes very, very painful.

08:05.079 --> 08:07.089
If that's getting bruised,

08:05.079 --> 08:07.089
then that's not

08:07.100 --> 08:08.220
really soft tissue as much.

08:08.230 --> 08:10.160
That's rib right there,

08:08.230 --> 08:10.160
cartilage usually

08:10.170 --> 08:12.019
unless it became ossified.

08:12.029 --> 08:14.220
-Is it osteoma?

08:12.029 --> 08:14.220
-Well, if it was osteoma,

08:14.230 --> 08:16.209
the CAT scan would show it.

08:16.220 --> 08:18.189
Our minds are going places.

08:18.199 --> 08:20.160
We're like medical

08:18.199 --> 08:20.160
detective for the moment.

08:20.170 --> 08:22.250
There's a thing called

08:20.170 --> 08:22.250
differential diagnosis

08:22.259 --> 08:26.009
in medicine.

08:22.259 --> 08:26.009
What are the possible diagnoses

08:26.019 --> 08:29.269
that this thing could be, from

08:26.019 --> 08:29.269
most likely to least likely.

08:29.279 --> 08:32.220
And when you have to

08:29.279 --> 08:32.220
form a differential diagnosis,

08:32.230 --> 08:35.009
it usually means

08:32.230 --> 08:35.009
the diagnosis is not obvious.

08:35.019 --> 08:39.059
But you had a cat scan

08:35.019 --> 08:39.059
and it didn't show anything.

08:39.070 --> 08:41.009
Yeah so this is the crazy story.

08:41.019 --> 08:44.179
So, 20 years ago,

08:41.019 --> 08:44.179
I tried the liposuction

08:49.259 --> 08:53.090
-It's very weird.

08:49.259 --> 08:53.090
-That's why I wanna see it.

08:54.029 --> 08:55.210
The first thing

08:54.029 --> 08:55.210
he said when he came out

08:55.220 --> 08:57.090

08:55.220 --> 08:57.090

08:57.100 --> 09:00.169
-of cartilage that is a defect--

08:57.100 --> 09:00.169
-What was it?

09:00.179 --> 09:03.179
He referred to it as,

09:00.179 --> 09:03.179
like, a deformity.

09:03.190 --> 09:06.230
He made it very clear

09:03.190 --> 09:06.230
that it was unavoidable.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.009
Look at little baby.

09:09.190 --> 09:11.070
Is this the first time

09:09.190 --> 09:11.070
he's fed her?

09:11.080 --> 09:13.230
-He's tried before.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.230
-Whoa, wait a minute-- ahh!

09:17.009 --> 09:18.240
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

09:19.169 --> 09:21.090
Stand up for a second.

09:21.100 --> 09:25.259
This one is soft and

09:21.100 --> 09:25.259
it's distinct from the rib too.

09:25.269 --> 09:27.230
-This one looks bigger.

09:25.269 --> 09:27.230
-This one is bigger.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.149
So when

09:27.240 --> 09:29.149
you're lying down sometimes,

09:29.159 --> 09:32.159
it probably goes right

09:29.159 --> 09:32.159
over and that's when it hurts?

09:32.269 --> 09:36.000
These masses

09:32.269 --> 09:36.000
feel like balls of fat.

09:36.009 --> 09:39.019
I've never seen

09:36.009 --> 09:39.019
anything like this before.

09:39.029 --> 09:44.070
Have a seat. So, what is

09:39.029 --> 09:44.070
the differential diagnosis?

09:44.080 --> 09:46.129
What do you think is at

09:44.080 --> 09:46.129
the top of the list?

09:46.139 --> 09:49.000
-Lipoma.

09:46.139 --> 09:49.000
-He thinks it's just lipomas.

09:49.009 --> 09:51.129
-A fatty tumor.

09:51.139 --> 09:53.080
I don't think

09:51.139 --> 09:53.080
it's necessarily that.

09:53.090 --> 09:56.019
I think you would probably

09:53.090 --> 09:56.019
see a fatty tumor on a CAT scan.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.200
Particularly when

09:56.029 --> 09:57.200
they're this big.

09:57.210 --> 09:59.100
I think,

09:57.210 --> 09:59.100
see if you agree with this,

09:59.110 --> 10:02.190
and you don't have to,

09:59.110 --> 10:02.190
and if he doesn't, he's wrong.

10:04.009 --> 10:05.100
We'll just-- no.

10:06.059 --> 10:09.000
So, I think it's--

10:06.059 --> 10:09.000
wait for it--

10:09.110 --> 10:12.279
Paradoxical Fatty

10:09.110 --> 10:12.279
Hypoplasia.

10:14.190 --> 10:16.159
Think about cool sculpting.

10:19.120 --> 10:22.279
There's this phenomenon

10:19.120 --> 10:22.279
when it comes to fat.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.190
You consider doing liposuction.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.210
You put these

10:24.200 --> 10:26.210
freezing devices on.

10:26.220 --> 10:28.110
It's called cryolipolysis.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.240
It kills

10:28.120 --> 10:30.240
the fat through freezing it

10:30.250 --> 10:34.110
and then it dies

10:30.250 --> 10:34.110
and then you urinate it out.

10:34.120 --> 10:38.070
But three to as much as

10:34.120 --> 10:38.070
10% chance that instead

10:38.080 --> 10:43.059
of it dissolving the fat, it

10:38.080 --> 10:43.059
causes the fat to grow up. Yes.

10:43.070 --> 10:45.039
I don't have one of

10:43.070 --> 10:45.039
these freezing machines,

10:45.049 --> 10:47.179
but I have

10:45.049 --> 10:47.179
seen this dozens of times.

10:47.190 --> 10:50.230
My theory is

10:47.190 --> 10:50.230
that all of the trauma

10:50.240 --> 10:53.240
that Bruno's chest has

10:50.240 --> 10:53.240
sustained from that surfing

10:53.250 --> 10:56.269
has caused

10:53.250 --> 10:56.269
the masses in his chest.

10:56.279 --> 10:59.289
Usually, you would think,

10:56.279 --> 10:59.289
it would cause atrophy

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
or reduction in fat in

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
that area, but in his case,

11:04.009 --> 11:07.169
it's caused a more

11:04.009 --> 11:07.169
rare form of paradoxical

11:07.179 --> 11:10.019
increase

11:07.179 --> 11:10.019
in the amount of tissue,

11:10.029 --> 11:13.090
which is very unusual

11:10.029 --> 11:13.090
but very interesting.

11:13.100 --> 11:17.269
Now, what's confusing though,

11:13.100 --> 11:17.269
is that if I am right

11:17.279 --> 11:19.279
and it's

11:17.279 --> 11:19.279
Paradoxical Fatty Hypoplasia,

11:19.289 --> 11:22.169
the liposuction

11:19.289 --> 11:22.169
should have worked.

11:22.179 --> 11:24.049
No change.

11:22.179 --> 11:24.049
That's the weird part.

11:24.059 --> 11:25.240
Very weird.

11:25.250 --> 11:28.059
So, we have

11:25.250 --> 11:28.059
our differential diagnosis of--

11:28.070 --> 11:30.059
I think it's

11:28.070 --> 11:30.059
Paradoxical Fatty Hypoplasia.

11:30.070 --> 11:32.250
I think most doctors

11:30.070 --> 11:32.250
like Dr. Nassif

11:32.259 --> 11:34.049
would think it's a lipoma.

11:34.059 --> 11:36.080
I think that's second

11:34.059 --> 11:36.080
on the list

11:36.090 --> 11:40.059
and then there's a third

11:36.090 --> 11:40.059
"oma" that's possible

11:40.070 --> 11:42.210
called a fascinoma,

11:40.070 --> 11:42.210
where we don't know

11:42.220 --> 11:44.120
what it is but

11:42.220 --> 11:44.120
it's totally fascinating.

11:44.129 --> 11:48.090
Either way, it has to be

11:44.129 --> 11:48.090
operated on to remove it.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.019
We do a tummy tuck,

11:48.100 --> 11:50.019
make an incision.

11:50.029 --> 11:52.009
Lift it up,

11:50.029 --> 11:52.009
take the whole thing out

11:52.019 --> 11:57.049
and pull down the excess skin

11:52.019 --> 11:57.049
and in your case the advantage

11:57.059 --> 12:00.139
of that is that all

11:57.059 --> 12:00.139
of this would be gone.

12:00.149 --> 12:01.289
The skin would be all tight.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.210
I never imagined

12:02.000 --> 12:03.210
I would get a tummy tuck.

12:03.220 --> 12:05.110

12:05.120 --> 12:08.220

12:08.230 --> 12:11.029
We have to take it out because

12:08.230 --> 12:11.029
I don't know if they're going

12:11.039 --> 12:12.269

realize that it was crooked.

13:57.019 --> 14:00.129
There is such

13:57.019 --> 14:00.129
a crookedness to my tip.

14:00.139 --> 14:03.019
And I feel like

14:00.139 --> 14:03.019
that is the main thing,

14:03.029 --> 14:06.100
when I look at pictures,

14:03.029 --> 14:06.100
that is all I see.

14:06.110 --> 14:08.230
And there's

14:06.110 --> 14:08.230
a fear that the older I get,

14:08.240 --> 14:10.090
the worse it will get.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.279
It's been 26 years

14:10.100 --> 14:12.279
since my first surgery.

14:12.289 --> 14:14.129
Dr. Nassif

14:12.289 --> 14:14.129
and Dr. Dubrow are really

14:14.139 --> 14:16.259
the only ones

14:14.139 --> 14:16.259
that I have reached out to.

14:16.269 --> 14:18.129
Call me ambitious

14:16.269 --> 14:18.129
but I just thought

14:18.139 --> 14:21.000
that I'd go straight

14:18.139 --> 14:21.000
to the top.

14:21.009 --> 14:24.259
I just want to hear "yes, I can

14:21.009 --> 14:24.259
make it better

14:24.269 --> 14:28.059
"and it's certainly not going

14:24.269 --> 14:28.059
to be any worse than it is."

14:28.070 --> 14:30.169
-Mrs. Mississippi.

14:28.070 --> 14:30.169
-Yes! Well, not really.

14:30.179 --> 14:33.019
-How are you? Dr. Nassif.

14:30.179 --> 14:33.019
-Terry Dubrow.

14:33.029 --> 14:34.120
[overlapping greetings]

14:34.129 --> 14:36.039
Love the outfit.

14:34.129 --> 14:36.039
Who's this, your sister?

14:36.049 --> 14:38.190
-It is, oh the compliments.

14:36.049 --> 14:38.190
-What's your name?

14:38.200 --> 14:41.129
-Jackie.

14:38.200 --> 14:41.129
-Jackie. Dr. Dubrow, Dr. Nassif.

14:41.139 --> 14:44.009
-Pleasure to meet you.

14:41.139 --> 14:44.009
-So nice to meet you.

14:44.019 --> 14:46.039
Look at that southern charm.

14:46.049 --> 14:48.159
So we'd like to know,

14:46.049 --> 14:48.159
tell us when this all started.

14:48.169 --> 14:50.159
Give us a little

14:48.169 --> 14:50.159
history behind everything.

14:50.169 --> 14:53.009
Well, I come from

14:50.169 --> 14:53.009
a long line of beautiful women.

14:53.019 --> 14:55.029
All have a hump on their nose.

14:55.039 --> 14:56.169
This is what

14:55.039 --> 14:56.169
God had to work with.

14:56.179 --> 14:58.090
But I don't

14:56.179 --> 14:58.090
feel like it was nearly

14:58.100 --> 15:00.169
as prominent on

14:58.100 --> 15:00.169
their face because their face

15:00.179 --> 15:02.019
is just shaped differently.

15:02.029 --> 15:04.029
So you had a bump, a hump.

15:04.039 --> 15:05.250
Yes.

15:04.039 --> 15:05.250
Exactly. Huge bump.

15:05.259 --> 15:06.289
On a petite face.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.289
Yes, and it was thicker too.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.179
Was it straight?

15:09.000 --> 15:10.179
It was.

15:10.190 --> 15:13.250
So, when I was 16,

15:10.190 --> 15:13.250
we went to an ENT because

15:13.259 --> 15:19.009
I had a serious sinus infection

15:13.259 --> 15:19.009
and he looked at me and was like

15:19.019 --> 15:21.059
"I can do something about that."

15:19.019 --> 15:21.059
And wanted to do--

15:21.070 --> 15:23.070
he was like " I can

15:21.070 --> 15:23.070
do something about that too."

15:23.080 --> 15:24.200
-Like, you know--

15:23.080 --> 15:24.200
-So he wanted two-for-one,

15:24.210 --> 15:26.049
take care of the humps.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.269
Wait, wait,

15:26.059 --> 15:27.269
let me ask you a question.

15:27.279 --> 15:29.279
Did he bring it up or did

15:27.279 --> 15:29.279
you guys

15:29.289 --> 15:31.120
-bring it up?

15:29.289 --> 15:31.120
-He brought it up.

15:31.129 --> 15:33.080
What happened

15:31.129 --> 15:33.080
to Christy and her mother

15:33.090 --> 15:36.000
is retail medicine at its worst.

15:36.009 --> 15:38.039
She went in

15:36.009 --> 15:38.039
for a sinus infection,

15:38.049 --> 15:41.169
and they got offered

15:38.049 --> 15:41.169
a two-for-one rhinoplasty.

15:41.179 --> 15:43.059
Unbelievable.

15:43.070 --> 15:45.129
What happened, you said

15:43.070 --> 15:45.129
"No, I'm fine with mine".

15:45.139 --> 15:47.129
Well, for one thing,

15:45.139 --> 15:47.129
who's gonna take care of her?

15:47.139 --> 15:50.080
So the first thing he said

15:47.139 --> 15:50.080
when he came out of surgery.

15:50.090 --> 15:54.039
There is a piece

15:50.090 --> 15:54.039
of cartilage that is a defect.

15:54.049 --> 15:57.009
-What was it?

15:54.049 --> 15:57.009
-Well, he referred to it as,

15:57.019 --> 15:59.080
like a deformity,

15:57.019 --> 15:59.080
like a flap,

15:59.090 --> 16:03.259
and he made it very clear

15:59.090 --> 16:03.259
that it was unavoidable.

16:03.269 --> 16:06.009
It's looked like this

16:03.269 --> 16:06.009
since that day.

16:06.019 --> 16:09.000
It's just

16:06.019 --> 16:09.000
progressively gotten worse.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.200
Lift your head back,

16:09.009 --> 16:10.200
lift your head up.

16:10.210 --> 16:15.000
-Was it that--

16:10.210 --> 16:15.000
-Yes, it's 100% what this is.

16:15.009 --> 16:16.220
Is that what

16:15.009 --> 16:16.220
we're talking about?

16:16.230 --> 16:18.129
-Yes.

16:16.230 --> 16:18.129
-When you are aggressive

16:18.139 --> 16:22.070
with the tip, and most

16:18.139 --> 16:22.070
doctors 25, 26 years ago,

16:22.080 --> 16:24.019
you remember this,

16:22.080 --> 16:24.019
we're going there

16:24.029 --> 16:25.179
and cutting away cartilage.

16:25.190 --> 16:27.220
Christy's nose does

16:25.190 --> 16:27.220
not have a deformity.

16:27.230 --> 16:30.289
Most likely, the doctor

16:27.230 --> 16:30.289
took too much cartilage out

16:31.000 --> 16:32.200
and that's what caused it

16:31.000 --> 16:32.200
to become crooked.

16:32.210 --> 16:35.039
And instead of

16:32.210 --> 16:35.039
admitting the error in his ways,

16:35.049 --> 16:38.000
he just blamed it on her nose

16:35.049 --> 16:38.000
and made excuses.

16:38.009 --> 16:39.200
The hump though, was it better?

16:39.210 --> 16:40.259
Yes, the hump, was,

16:40.269 --> 16:42.149
I mean, it was a hump.

16:42.159 --> 16:45.080
I loved the fact that I liked

16:42.159 --> 16:45.080
my profile better.

16:45.090 --> 16:47.220
You know,

16:45.090 --> 16:47.220
so I focused on that.

16:47.230 --> 16:52.070
Then fast forward to me

16:47.230 --> 16:52.070
becoming a real estate broker.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.120
We slap our face on everything.

16:54.129 --> 16:56.139
-So, it-- Yes!

16:54.129 --> 16:56.139
-That's true.

16:56.149 --> 16:59.039
It's just

16:56.149 --> 16:59.039
a constant thing, still.

16:59.049 --> 17:01.139
In the back of my head.

16:59.049 --> 17:01.139
I hate my nose.

17:01.149 --> 17:03.279
I can see your beautiful face

17:01.149 --> 17:03.279
on a nice bus stop.

17:03.289 --> 17:06.089
You actually would

17:03.289 --> 17:06.089
look good with that.

17:06.200 --> 17:09.160
Listen, if I was

17:06.200 --> 17:09.160
going to be on a billboard,

17:09.170 --> 17:11.019
of course,

17:09.170 --> 17:11.019
you know, looking good,

17:11.029 --> 17:12.230
looking just like this.

17:11.029 --> 17:12.230
Nice and dapper.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.059
I'd have to be on Sunset Strip

17:12.240 --> 17:16.059
as you're driving down,

17:16.069 --> 17:18.130
all the traffic,

17:16.069 --> 17:18.130
everyone's cruising

17:18.140 --> 17:21.019
and then you see

17:18.140 --> 17:21.019
my gorgeous picture up there.

17:21.029 --> 17:24.279
Would I like that?

17:21.029 --> 17:24.279
Yeah, I think I would.

17:24.289 --> 17:26.150
Christy, what are your goals?

17:26.160 --> 17:28.240
I hate to say, I mean,

17:26.160 --> 17:28.240
I'm a semi-vain person.

17:28.250 --> 17:32.059
So it's like, OK, do

17:28.250 --> 17:32.059
I trade a good cosmetic outcome

17:32.069 --> 17:34.220
and still not be able

17:32.069 --> 17:34.220
to breathe? I probably would.

17:34.230 --> 17:38.000
So, you know,

17:34.230 --> 17:38.000
I just would like it straight.

17:38.009 --> 17:40.000
There's stuff going on

17:38.009 --> 17:40.000
with the tip

17:40.009 --> 17:42.059
but I do not want a wider nose.

17:42.069 --> 17:44.240
-If that's possible.

17:42.069 --> 17:44.240
-When patients dictate

17:44.250 --> 17:46.170
what you should do, it's scary.

17:46.180 --> 17:50.079
So am I a little bit worried

17:46.180 --> 17:50.079
about working with Christy?

17:50.089 --> 17:53.029
Absolutely.

17:50.089 --> 17:53.029
This is your wish.

17:53.039 --> 17:55.130
-Don't know if it's real.

17:53.039 --> 17:55.130
-Wrong answer?

17:55.140 --> 17:58.150
[laughing]

17:58.160 --> 18:00.160
So all that

17:58.160 --> 18:00.160
has to be softened.

18:00.170 --> 18:02.220
Is it gonna drop the tip?

18:00.170 --> 18:02.220
We have to drop the tip.

18:02.230 --> 18:06.109
I do not wanna trade

18:02.230 --> 18:06.109
one insecurity for another.

18:07.079 --> 18:09.109
I gave my doctor free

18:07.079 --> 18:09.109
reign and I woke up

18:09.119 --> 18:11.170
and he said, "All I could

18:09.119 --> 18:11.170
get in there was 1250 CC's."

18:11.180 --> 18:13.200
And what did you think,

18:11.180 --> 18:13.200
right away?

18:13.210 --> 18:15.230
-Whatever makes her happy.

18:13.210 --> 18:15.230
-You never do that to me.

18:15.240 --> 18:18.029
Well I shaved your back once.

18:15.240 --> 18:18.029
That made you happy.

18:18.039 --> 18:19.190
Oh no.

18:25.200 --> 18:28.089
back for us.ht, put yo

18:28.099 --> 18:30.089
So there's your deviated septum.

18:30.099 --> 18:32.220
Your whole left septum

18:30.099 --> 18:32.220
is in the airway on the left.

18:32.230 --> 18:36.000
When a patient states

18:32.230 --> 18:36.000
"I don't want a wider nose"

18:36.009 --> 18:37.250
and you have to do

18:36.009 --> 18:37.250
a reconstruction,

18:37.259 --> 18:40.049
to make the nose straighter,

18:37.259 --> 18:40.049
I have to make it bigger.

18:40.059 --> 18:41.210
So that's a red flag,

18:40.059 --> 18:41.210
so now we have

18:41.220 --> 18:43.160
to work through

18:41.220 --> 18:43.160
this one way or the other.

18:43.170 --> 18:45.220
So first of all, you need

18:43.170 --> 18:45.220
that work on the septum.

18:45.230 --> 18:48.019
Number one thing

18:45.230 --> 18:48.019
to help straighten your nose.

18:48.029 --> 18:49.180
I'm gonna make

18:48.029 --> 18:49.180
your breathing better.

18:49.190 --> 18:52.089
Now you're also crooked

18:49.190 --> 18:52.089
besides the septum.

18:52.099 --> 18:54.190
You're caved in on the middle

18:54.200 --> 18:57.160
part of your nose,

18:54.200 --> 18:57.160
especially on the right side.

18:57.170 --> 19:00.259
Now that's because some of the

18:57.170 --> 19:00.259
cartilage up there is just weak.

19:00.269 --> 19:03.119
I have to do something

19:00.269 --> 19:03.119
called spreader grafts.

19:03.130 --> 19:05.259
That will give us

19:03.130 --> 19:05.259
the best success

19:05.269 --> 19:07.099
for getting a straighter nose.

19:07.109 --> 19:09.259
It's better to have

19:07.109 --> 19:09.259
a little wider,

19:09.269 --> 19:13.259
straight nose

19:09.269 --> 19:13.259
versus a skinny, crooked nose.

19:13.269 --> 19:17.089
What Dr. Nassif

19:13.269 --> 19:17.089
is describing scares me

19:17.099 --> 19:20.160
because the grafts

19:17.099 --> 19:20.160
that he would have to use

19:20.170 --> 19:23.180
could make

19:20.170 --> 19:23.180
my nose thicker or wider

19:23.190 --> 19:27.140
and I know for sure that's

19:23.190 --> 19:27.140
one of the things I do not want.

19:27.150 --> 19:29.150
This is that typical old school,

19:29.160 --> 19:31.160
overdone looking nose

19:29.160 --> 19:31.160
where this hangs.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.109
It's called

19:31.170 --> 19:33.109
over-rotated infratip.

19:33.119 --> 19:35.109
So all that has to be softened.

19:35.119 --> 19:37.069
-Is it gonna drop the tip?

19:35.119 --> 19:37.069
-We have to

19:37.079 --> 19:38.210
drop the tip, directly.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.210
Here's the long

19:38.220 --> 19:40.210
and the short of it.

19:40.220 --> 19:43.089
I do not want to trade

19:40.220 --> 19:43.089
one insecurity--

19:43.099 --> 19:45.109
-For another one.

19:45.119 --> 19:46.259
If my tip was dropped or if

19:46.269 --> 19:50.039
it was piggy, I would rather

19:46.269 --> 19:50.039
not do anything.

19:50.049 --> 19:52.150
You've voiced some concern,

19:52.160 --> 19:54.200
which puts up my little

19:52.160 --> 19:54.200
hairs on the back of my neck.

19:54.210 --> 19:57.150
He might say

19:54.210 --> 19:57.150
that I have a lot but I don't.

19:57.160 --> 20:01.049
But I have to do these

19:57.160 --> 20:01.049
things so I can help your nose.

20:01.059 --> 20:02.160
What do you think

20:01.059 --> 20:02.160
she should do, mom?

20:02.170 --> 20:04.059
I think we need to go home

20:04.069 --> 20:06.019
and just think about

20:04.069 --> 20:06.019
what we're doing.

20:06.029 --> 20:07.160
You do need to do your homework.

20:07.170 --> 20:09.160
I have to be able

20:07.170 --> 20:09.160
to do what I wanna do.

20:09.170 --> 20:11.069
Because it's gonna have

20:09.170 --> 20:11.069
my signature on your nose.

20:11.079 --> 20:13.099
But you have to feel

20:11.079 --> 20:13.099
comfortable with it.

20:13.109 --> 20:17.130
100%. Flying all the way from

Mississippi, just to get

20:17.140 --> 20:22.230
a consultation and not

20:17.140 --> 20:22.230
do the surgery is scary.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.259
But in order to move

20:22.240 --> 20:25.259
forward, I just need to feel

20:25.269 --> 20:30.220
that it is going to absolutely

20:25.269 --> 20:30.220
be better and not worse.

20:30.230 --> 20:34.019
I really wanna take everything

20:30.230 --> 20:34.019
that you told me, look at

20:34.029 --> 20:36.220
some before and after pictures,

20:34.029 --> 20:36.220
and if I do move forward,

20:36.230 --> 20:41.190
I 100% trust that what you do

20:36.230 --> 20:41.190
is going to be perfect.

the amount of rippling.

26:00.210 --> 26:03.269
Now, there are

26:00.210 --> 26:03.269
some solutions for that

26:03.279 --> 26:07.210
and one solution is to downsize

26:03.279 --> 26:07.210
you and use silicone implants,

26:07.220 --> 26:10.079
which would be 50% smaller

26:10.089 --> 26:14.180
because they only make

26:10.089 --> 26:14.180
800 CC silicone implants.

26:14.190 --> 26:17.009
By taking the saline implant,

26:14.190 --> 26:17.009
removing it,

26:17.019 --> 26:19.079
and switching it to silicone,

26:19.089 --> 26:22.190
that should alleviate

26:19.089 --> 26:22.190
most, if not all the rippling,

26:22.200 --> 26:25.039
because silicone is more full,

26:25.049 --> 26:30.140
more viscus and tends to ripple

26:25.049 --> 26:30.140
less than saline or saltwater.

26:30.150 --> 26:34.250
The other thing to do is

26:30.150 --> 26:34.250
moving body fat into the area.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.190
Why don't you stand up

26:34.259 --> 26:37.190
for a sec and let's see.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.230
So, that's gonna

26:37.200 --> 26:39.230
be a problem.

26:39.240 --> 26:42.059
-Yeah, there's no body fat.

26:39.240 --> 26:42.059
-There's no body fat.

26:42.069 --> 26:44.140
-What's this little thingy?

26:42.069 --> 26:44.140
-My other hernia.

26:44.150 --> 26:45.289
But you had your hernias

26:44.150 --> 26:45.289
repaired, right?

26:46.000 --> 26:47.250
Why didn't they fix this one?

26:47.259 --> 26:50.029
When I went in, I told him

26:47.259 --> 26:50.029
I had two, he said, OK.

26:50.039 --> 26:52.190
When I came out,

26:50.039 --> 26:52.190
he said he only saw one.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.069
You know why

26:52.200 --> 26:54.069
your doctor missed this?

26:54.079 --> 26:56.009
-Your doctor didn't come here.

26:54.079 --> 26:56.009
-Oh.

26:56.019 --> 26:59.240
See how this is flat

26:56.019 --> 26:59.240
and this sticks out?

26:59.250 --> 27:02.089
Your doctor only

26:59.250 --> 27:02.089
tied up the lower part.

27:02.099 --> 27:05.089
Have a seat for a second.

27:02.099 --> 27:05.089
So this is very interesting.

27:05.099 --> 27:07.089
I recommend

27:05.099 --> 27:07.089
you don't have that fixed.

27:07.099 --> 27:08.259
Really?

27:08.269 --> 27:11.000
-You could but you might lose--

27:08.269 --> 27:11.000
-My abs.

27:11.009 --> 27:13.269
Some of the local abs there,

27:11.009 --> 27:13.269
'cause to fix it,

27:13.279 --> 27:16.079
you sew it back together.

27:16.089 --> 27:19.069
If you pull this,

27:16.089 --> 27:19.069
it might take the abs with it.

27:19.079 --> 27:22.099
Oh, I didn't think I'd ever

27:19.079 --> 27:22.099
be so happy to have a hernia.

27:22.109 --> 27:24.230
Knowing that it's

27:22.109 --> 27:24.230
saved all the hard work

27:24.240 --> 27:26.250
that I've done in the gyms,

27:24.240 --> 27:26.250
so that I still have abs

27:26.259 --> 27:28.250
is very relieving.

27:28.259 --> 27:30.250
Alright, Cyndi.

27:30.259 --> 27:32.170
Should we go

27:30.259 --> 27:32.170
to the operating room tomorrow

27:32.180 --> 27:35.250
and downsize you

27:32.180 --> 27:35.250
and put an 800 CC silicone

27:35.259 --> 27:38.039
and have loose skin

27:35.259 --> 27:38.039
and be much smaller?

27:39.089 --> 27:41.150
No. How about

27:39.089 --> 27:41.150
we just spray tan it

27:41.160 --> 27:43.049
so we can't see it anymore?

27:43.059 --> 27:44.220
-Right.

27:43.059 --> 27:44.220
-Sounds good to me.

27:44.230 --> 27:46.099
That's an easy fix.

27:46.210 --> 27:48.250
But I actually

27:46.210 --> 27:48.250
learned something today.

I'll begin

28:50.079 --> 28:52.109
by liposuction-ing the fat

28:52.119 --> 28:54.099
on both sides of his flanks.

28:54.109 --> 28:56.119
I will then make an incision

28:54.109 --> 28:56.119
across his lower abdomen,

28:56.130 --> 28:58.259
elevate up the abdominal wall

28:56.130 --> 28:58.259
and remove the masses,

28:58.269 --> 29:01.180
and then send a sample

28:58.269 --> 29:01.180
off to pathology

29:01.190 --> 29:04.039
to confirm what it is

29:01.190 --> 29:04.039
and if it's cancerous.

29:04.049 --> 29:07.230
Lastly, I will remove the exces

29:04.049 --> 29:07.230
skin before closing him up.

29:07.240 --> 29:10.119
Well, his flank fat

29:07.240 --> 29:10.119
suctions very easily.

29:10.130 --> 29:13.119
Let's make

29:10.130 --> 29:13.119
our abdominal incision.

29:13.130 --> 29:17.130
Alright, we're about to enter

29:13.130 --> 29:17.130
into the area of these masses.

29:17.140 --> 29:19.230
Look at this,

29:17.140 --> 29:19.230
it looks like a goddamn alien.

29:19.240 --> 29:22.180
Now that I have

29:19.240 --> 29:22.180
my eyes on this thing,

29:22.190 --> 29:27.119
it seems that my theory

29:22.190 --> 29:27.119
of Paradoxical Fatty Hypoplasia

29:27.130 --> 29:31.069
is probably potentially correct,

29:27.130 --> 29:31.069
but I can tell you,

29:31.079 --> 29:35.029
it doesn't typically

29:31.079 --> 29:35.029
cause these little fatty cysts

with that surrounding

29:35.039 --> 29:38.240
scar tissue on the inside.

29:38.250 --> 29:41.210

29:58.210 --> 30:02.069
Paradoxical Fatty Hypoplasia,

30:02.079 --> 30:05.029
and all those years

30:02.079 --> 30:05.029
of surfing on it

30:05.039 --> 30:07.089
and laying on it

30:05.039 --> 30:07.089
just scarred it in.

30:07.099 --> 30:09.200
That's why

30:07.099 --> 30:09.200
it didn't suction out.

30:09.210 --> 30:13.049
That would make sense.

30:09.210 --> 30:13.049
That would make a lot of sense.

30:26.279 --> 30:29.019
MAN:

30:26.279 --> 30:29.019
Very prominent ribS.

30:29.029 --> 30:31.200
One of the things

30:29.029 --> 30:31.200
that makes this very strange is

30:31.210 --> 30:36.069
that this overgrowth of

30:31.210 --> 30:36.069
fat is causing so much pain.

30:36.079 --> 30:38.210
I think it's probably due

30:36.079 --> 30:38.210
to the fact that there's scar

30:38.220 --> 30:40.109
from the trauma of surfing

30:40.119 --> 30:43.009
within the fat

30:40.119 --> 30:43.009
on his prominent chest wall

30:43.019 --> 30:46.289
where the lower ribs

30:43.019 --> 30:46.289
are located and that's painful.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.079
That makes a lot

30:47.000 --> 30:49.079
of physiological sense.

30:49.089 --> 30:50.220
Okay.

30:50.230 --> 30:52.150
Now, we gotta

30:50.230 --> 30:52.150
deal with the loose skin.

30:52.160 --> 30:55.000
Hopefully it bleeds.

30:55.009 --> 30:57.079
Does seem

30:55.009 --> 30:57.079
to bleed pretty nicely.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.160
Okay.

30:58.170 --> 31:00.130
So this is usually

30:58.170 --> 31:00.130
the same amount of tissue

31:00.140 --> 31:02.109
we usually take off

31:00.140 --> 31:02.109
a previously pregnant abdomen.

31:02.119 --> 31:03.220
You know what I mean?

31:05.210 --> 31:07.160
OK, so, we're done.

31:07.170 --> 31:10.210
In my mind, that was

31:07.170 --> 31:10.210

31:10.220 --> 31:12.269
with an unknown,

31:10.220 --> 31:12.269
mysterious component

31:12.279 --> 31:14.130
that is still a mystery.

31:14.140 --> 31:16.069
The answer

33:00.150 --> 33:04.089
I mean, it looks like coral.

33:00.150 --> 33:04.089
That's freaking weird.

33:07.109 --> 33:09.140
between that mass

33:07.109 --> 33:09.140
and the surrounding tissue.

33:09.150 --> 33:12.190
It was involved in

33:09.150 --> 33:12.190
the surrounding tissue.

33:12.200 --> 33:15.150
Which is very

33:12.200 --> 33:15.150
characteristic of malignancy.

We'll know in about

three days what the story is.

weird stuff inside.

-Absolutely.

34:22.050 --> 34:24.130
-So from the frontal view,

34:24.139 --> 34:27.019
we wanna make sure that

34:24.139 --> 34:27.019
the middle part of your nose

34:27.030 --> 34:28.269
is a lot straighter,

34:28.280 --> 34:31.090
even through it does make it

34:28.280 --> 34:31.090
just a slight little bit wider.

34:31.099 --> 34:33.039
We also wanna pull down

34:31.099 --> 34:33.039
the tip of the nose,

34:33.050 --> 34:34.119
then from the side view,

34:34.130 --> 34:35.280
remember, you're gonna have

a little bit less nostril

PAUL:

34:52.090 --> 34:54.099
For Christy's surgery today,

34:54.110 --> 34:56.079
Dr. Ping will harvest rib

34:54.110 --> 34:56.079
while I open the nose.

34:56.090 --> 34:58.150
Next, I will perform

34:56.090 --> 34:58.150
the septoplastia

34:58.159 --> 35:00.159
with PDS plate and add

34:58.159 --> 35:00.159
spreader grafts to straighten

35:00.170 --> 35:02.110
and widen her nose

35:00.170 --> 35:02.110
and airway,

35:02.119 --> 35:04.179
then we'll use

35:02.119 --> 35:04.179
a Lateral Crural Strut Graft

35:04.190 --> 35:07.079
to help pop out the indentation

35:04.190 --> 35:07.079
on her right side.

35:07.090 --> 35:09.170
Finally we'll insert

35:07.090 --> 35:09.170
articulating rim grafts

35:09.179 --> 35:11.179
in the immediate

35:09.179 --> 35:11.179
intermedial croral overlay

35:11.190 --> 35:14.070

so both Christy and I are happy

35:17.090 --> 35:20.070
Okay,

35:17.090 --> 35:20.070
making my first incision.

35:20.079 --> 35:22.039
Okay, she's already

35:20.079 --> 35:22.039
oozing a lot.

35:22.050 --> 35:25.190
PING: Yeah, she's really oozy

35:22.050 --> 35:25.190
for me too, even in the rib.

35:25.199 --> 35:27.130
When a patient oozes

35:25.199 --> 35:27.130
a good amount of blood

35:27.139 --> 35:30.110
during surgery,

35:27.139 --> 35:30.110
the most common reasons are

35:30.119 --> 35:32.150
one: they've taken

35:30.119 --> 35:32.150
some blood thinners

35:32.159 --> 35:35.050
or two: they drank alcohol

35:32.159 --> 35:35.050
a few days before surgery

35:35.059 --> 35:38.070
which is against

35:35.059 --> 35:38.070
our pre-op instructions.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.210
PING: Got this

35:38.219 --> 35:40.210
nice piece of rib out.

35:40.219 --> 35:43.260
PAUL: Let's

35:40.219 --> 35:43.260
start with the septoplasty.

35:44.099 --> 35:47.050
When you have

35:44.099 --> 35:47.050
a really bad deviant septum,

35:47.059 --> 35:49.190
you wanna take as much

35:47.059 --> 35:49.190
of it away as possible

35:49.199 --> 35:52.010
because the more deviant

35:49.199 --> 35:52.010
and septum you take away,

35:52.019 --> 35:54.059
the easier it is

35:52.019 --> 35:54.059
to get it straight.

35:54.070 --> 35:56.139
So we're gonna

35:54.070 --> 35:56.139
just leave enough

35:56.150 --> 35:59.199
so it supports the nose

35:56.150 --> 35:59.199
and see the PDS plate.

35:59.210 --> 36:02.119
PDS plate is basically made

35:59.210 --> 36:02.119
out of suture material

36:02.130 --> 36:04.239
that will

36:02.130 --> 36:04.239
dissolve in nine months,

36:04.250 --> 36:09.000
but I stitch it to the septum

36:04.250 --> 36:09.000
and that helps it straighten it.

36:09.010 --> 36:11.000
So this is gonna

36:09.010 --> 36:11.000
help pop out

36:11.010 --> 36:13.179
that depression she has

36:11.010 --> 36:13.179
on the side of her nose.

36:13.190 --> 36:15.090
At the same time,

36:13.190 --> 36:15.090
we're able to keep

36:15.099 --> 36:16.250
the tip at this point.

36:16.260 --> 36:19.079
Christy knows what she wants.

36:19.090 --> 36:21.210
However, with reconstructive

36:19.090 --> 36:21.210
rhinoplasty,

36:21.219 --> 36:24.050
you can't always give a patient

36:21.219 --> 36:24.050
what they want,

36:24.059 --> 36:25.250
but in this situation,

36:25.260 --> 36:28.010
she does not want

36:25.260 --> 36:28.010
her tip lowered too much.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.210
We need to respect

36:28.019 --> 36:30.210
those wishes because if I pull

36:30.219 --> 36:34.010
her nose down too much,

36:30.219 --> 36:34.010
she is not going to be happy.

36:34.019 --> 36:37.179
OK that's it.

36:34.019 --> 36:37.179
We're done.

36:49.110 --> 36:53.010
Making her profile

36:49.110 --> 36:53.010
look a lot softer,

36:53.019 --> 36:54.170
making the tip more symmetric,

a little bit rotated up.

has the Nassif tip,

39:11.250 --> 39:14.159
the surgery.

Now when I look at

39:35.190 --> 39:37.179
my nose in the mirror,

39:37.190 --> 39:41.000
I don't see all the

39:37.190 --> 39:41.000
imperfections that I did before.

39:41.010 --> 39:42.280
I just see what I feel like

39:42.289 --> 39:45.070
should have been on my face

39:42.289 --> 39:45.070
my entire life.

39:45.079 --> 39:50.059
-Oh, I love your new sign.

39:45.079 --> 39:50.059
-Doesn't it look amazing?

39:50.070 --> 39:52.239
Before my surgery,

39:50.070 --> 39:52.239
my nose was a real fixer upper.

39:52.250 --> 39:55.079
I had a deficit on the right,

39:52.250 --> 39:55.079
a crooked tip,

39:55.090 --> 39:59.219
and the columella hung too low.

39:55.090 --> 39:59.219
My nose was a hot mess.

39:59.230 --> 40:02.219
And I absolutely refused

39:59.230 --> 40:02.219
to get any new photos taken

40:02.230 --> 40:04.230
for my real estate business.

40:04.239 --> 40:08.099
But now, thank to Dr. Nassif,

40:04.239 --> 40:08.099
my nose is straight.

40:08.110 --> 40:10.099
It fits my face perfectly

40:10.110 --> 40:12.170
and it just makes me

40:10.110 --> 40:12.170
feel so excited

40:12.179 --> 40:14.139
for all the years to come

40:14.150 --> 40:16.190
that I get

40:14.150 --> 40:16.190
to live with my new nose.

40:16.199 --> 40:20.079
And there is a freedom

40:16.199 --> 40:20.079
that I feel that I can put

40:20.090 --> 40:25.230
my face on signs and billboards

40:20.090 --> 40:25.230
if I want to in all the places

40:25.239 --> 40:29.010
that I should be advertising,

40:25.239 --> 40:29.010
to move my business forward.

40:29.019 --> 40:31.280
You do not know what doors

40:29.019 --> 40:31.280
this is gonna open

40:31.289 --> 40:33.230
just because of that

40:31.289 --> 40:33.230
new freedom that you feel.

40:33.239 --> 40:36.280
I wish that Christy

40:33.239 --> 40:36.280
would have gotten

40:36.289 --> 40:40.099
these results at age 16

40:36.289 --> 40:40.099
but I feel like

40:40.110 --> 40:44.159
in the full spectrum of things,

40:40.110 --> 40:44.159
it has turned out perfectly.

40:44.170 --> 40:46.070
There's an insecurity

40:44.170 --> 40:46.070
there that I've carried

40:46.079 --> 40:48.000
with me my entire life.

40:48.010 --> 40:49.159
That's not there anymore

40:49.170 --> 40:51.210
and that's a freeing feeling.

40:51.219 --> 40:53.139
I'm proud for you.

40:53.150 --> 40:54.280
Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow

40:54.289 --> 40:56.289
probably

40:54.289 --> 40:56.289
don't even know how much

40:57.000 --> 40:59.289
it means to me to have

40:57.000 --> 40:59.289
the nose that I have now.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.019
They do amazing work

41:00.000 --> 41:03.019
and they do it every day

41:03.030 --> 41:04.179
so it's normal for them.

41:04.190 --> 41:07.019
The fact that I have a nose

41:04.190 --> 41:07.019
that I love

41:07.030 --> 41:10.239
for the first time in 30 years

41:07.030 --> 41:10.239
means more to me

41:10.250 --> 41:13.079
than they probably

41:10.250 --> 41:13.079
could ever understand.

41:13.090 --> 41:15.000
And I'm glad I was able

41:15.010 --> 41:17.139
to go through this

41:15.010 --> 41:17.139
journey with you, Christy.

41:17.150 --> 41:20.230
I could not have done it without

41:17.150 --> 41:20.230
you, so thank you so much.

41:20.239 --> 41:22.030
It was my pleasure.

41:22.039 --> 41:27.079

41:27.090 --> 41:30.079
♪

41:30.090 --> 41:33.250
BRUNO: We finally

41:30.090 --> 41:33.250
got the pathology report back

41:33.260 --> 41:36.000
and it showed that the masses

41:36.010 --> 41:39.230
were an overgrowth

41:36.010 --> 41:39.230
of fatty cells

41:39.239 --> 41:45.280
which is consistent with

41:39.239 --> 41:45.280
Paradoxical Fatty Hypoplasia.

41:46.250 --> 41:49.210
So, Dr. Dubrow was right

41:46.250 --> 41:49.210
and the best part,

41:49.219 --> 41:52.190
no cancer, thank God.

41:52.199 --> 41:56.000
So the mystery

41:52.199 --> 41:56.000
is finally solved

41:56.010 --> 41:58.130
and hopefully there will

41:56.010 --> 41:58.130
be a lot of surfing trips

41:58.139 --> 42:00.010
in my future.

42:00.019 --> 42:05.210
I cannot actually

42:00.019 --> 42:05.210
remember the last time

42:05.219 --> 42:07.210
I surfed without feeling pain.

42:07.219 --> 42:10.099
Today I was able to

42:07.219 --> 42:10.099
surf laying down on my chest.

42:10.110 --> 42:12.039
The bumps, they're gone.

42:12.050 --> 42:15.260
Absolutely amazing

42:12.050 --> 42:15.260
and my masses are cancer free.

42:15.269 --> 42:19.250
So, I just feel

42:15.269 --> 42:19.250
more connected with the ocean.

Super happy.

Look like a normal person now.

42:35.030 --> 42:36.219
I think he feels

42:35.030 --> 42:36.219
comfortable and confident.

-Enjoy being healthy.

42:38.280 --> 42:41.199
-What a difference, right?

42:41.210 --> 42:43.269
Like a skinny bitch now.

42:43.280 --> 42:46.119
Not that skinny.

42:43.280 --> 42:46.119
Just normal I think.

42:47.039 --> 42:51.119
Before my surgery, I had two

42:47.039 --> 42:51.119
huge masses on my chest

42:51.130 --> 42:54.280
but now, thanks to Dr. Dubrow,

42:51.130 --> 42:54.280
the masses have been removed,

42:54.289 --> 42:58.239
pain is gone and I can

43:05.010 --> 43:08.179
Let's get on it.

43:08.190 --> 43:10.059
I have so much

43:08.190 --> 43:10.059
to look forward to.

43:10.070 --> 43:14.190
Surf trips with Sara.

43:10.070 --> 43:14.190
That's what we live for.

43:16.289 --> 43:20.280
Having this booty has brought

43:16.289 --> 43:20.280
me to another level of success.

Your right buttock cheek--

43:25.019 --> 43:27.070
There's no cup.

43:25.019 --> 43:27.070
No banana peel.

43:27.079 --> 43:29.159
I have a banged-up chin.

43:29.170 --> 43:30.280
When we go out,

43:29.170 --> 43:30.280
I'm, like, hiding.

43:30.289 --> 43:32.179
I don't want

43:30.289 --> 43:32.179
people looking at me.

43:32.190 --> 43:35.210
There is a risk

43:32.190 --> 43:35.210
that I can make it worse.

43:36.070 --> 43:39.289
Brackegy took my breasts.

43:36.070 --> 43:39.289
I had hysterectomy with uterus.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.039
And I had my double mastectomy

43:40.000 --> 43:42.039
that same year.
