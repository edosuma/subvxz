01:30.534 --> 01:31.450
Thank you.

01:37.242 --> 01:40.283
It's been zero-zero forever.
I hate soccer.

01:41.575 --> 01:46.783
Hey, come on! Come on, score a damn goal.
What's wrong with these guys?

01:49.534 --> 01:51.492
- Have a drink, <i>amigo.</i>
- Take it easy.

01:52.741 --> 01:54.866
Why do you love
this restaurant so much?

01:56.158 --> 01:58.200
Because the food here
is amazing.

02:46.825 --> 02:49.908
- What will you have?
- The fillet mignon.

02:51.825 --> 02:53.242
You know what?

02:54.367 --> 02:56.699
I have to use the restroom. Be right back.

03:05.991 --> 03:07.866
Oh, did you see that?

03:10.658 --> 03:11.908
Hey, cheers.

03:12.741 --> 03:15.117
- Get a drink amigo.
- Hey, listen, take it easy.

03:15.908 --> 03:19.115
What a loser.
Did his guy's dog die or something?

03:19.117 --> 03:21.658
What's going on here man? Take it easy.

03:32.574 --> 03:35.156
- Hola, senorita!
- Hola.

03:35.158 --> 03:37.491
- You need a hand?
- I do not know what is wrong.

03:39.700 --> 03:41.117
I can take a look.

04:05.283 --> 04:06.950
Hey. Bathroom is closed.

04:07.866 --> 04:11.075
I got to go, <i>por favor.</i>

04:12.117 --> 04:13.031
Bathroom's closed.

04:20.866 --> 04:24.614
Well, who's in there? Who's in there,
like... like a Kardashian?

04:24.616 --> 04:26.741
Like you're having sex too.

04:28.908 --> 04:30.075
What was that for?

04:30.616 --> 04:33.533
Well, I don't think
you're going anywhere tonight.

04:34.741 --> 04:36.033
This looks bad.

04:36.409 --> 04:37.864
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:37.866 --> 04:38.825
Great.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.825
Maybe I can find you
a place to stay.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.574
Goal!

05:07.075 --> 05:08.117
Where is it?

05:10.908 --> 05:12.325
Do you know what you're doing?

05:14.325 --> 05:15.700
You're being robbed, asshole.

05:20.075 --> 05:22.240
At least show me where the money is.

05:22.242 --> 05:23.698
You will never get it.

05:23.700 --> 05:25.823
Once he knows I got this,
you'll be dead inside an hour,

05:25.825 --> 05:27.242
so you better change your story.

05:29.283 --> 05:30.242
No!

05:46.075 --> 05:47.656
Shit.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.449
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

06:04.783 --> 06:05.866
Time to go.

06:12.699 --> 06:13.658
The back door!

06:43.699 --> 06:44.783
I don't see her.

06:50.075 --> 06:51.533
Don't worry, don't worry.
She'll be here.

06:58.242 --> 06:59.533
A little help, Billy.

07:09.741 --> 07:11.033
Get in the car.

07:12.574 --> 07:16.031
- Wait, what about you?
- No way, we all go, or no one does.

07:16.033 --> 07:17.908
- That was the plan.
- The plan was screwed.

07:22.408 --> 07:24.616
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of here.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.198
Cops, cops, let's go.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.574
I'll hold them off.

07:31.408 --> 07:32.282
How?

07:33.033 --> 07:35.075
I'll give them what they want, me.

07:35.491 --> 07:37.700
Go. Go!

07:38.700 --> 07:40.366
Hey, hey, the drive.

07:42.991 --> 07:43.991
Okay, good.

08:01.282 --> 08:02.574
I give up.

08:12.449 --> 08:15.408
Hey, I give up, I give up. Whoa, whoa.
Hey, I give up.

08:20.075 --> 08:22.491
Do you even know
who you were trying to rob?

08:23.616 --> 08:25.866
Hey, hey, I'm not a thief.
I'm just a liberator.

08:27.783 --> 08:30.282
You think you can come to my country
and cause trouble?

08:31.574 --> 08:32.616
Who are you?

08:33.241 --> 08:35.783
Mr. John Doe, nice to meet you.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.406
Senator what about...

11:08.408 --> 11:12.157
Do you care to make a comment
about the border war proposal?

11:12.533 --> 11:15.989
Well, building a wall between the US
and Mexico will go a long way

11:15.991 --> 11:19.322
in keeping the criminal element
and the drugs out of our country.

11:19.324 --> 11:23.989
The Times, Senator. Are you saying that
all Latinos are criminals?

11:23.991 --> 11:25.614
Far from it.

11:25.616 --> 11:29.280
Actually, our neighbors here to the south
are both proud and ambitious people.

11:29.282 --> 11:31.322
We can't fault them
for a few bad apples now, can we?

11:31.324 --> 11:34.197
Well, then, how do you expect
the tax payers to pay for the wall

11:34.199 --> 11:37.449
when there are so many pressing issues
facing California.

11:38.116 --> 11:40.197
Where there's will, I see opportunity.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.239
And you can tell those tax payers
I will not be fitting them for that bill.

11:43.241 --> 11:45.906
- Thank you.
- Well then, Senator, tell me Senator...

11:45.908 --> 11:49.032
who then will pay for the wall?

11:49.241 --> 11:51.489
I'll take care of that. Thank you.

11:51.491 --> 11:53.741
No more questions, please.

12:00.282 --> 12:01.825
You think the wall's the answer?

12:04.408 --> 12:05.491
Agent Price.

12:11.574 --> 12:16.322
So, please tell me
what is the DEA doing down here,

12:16.324 --> 12:19.157
because I do not see us winning
this war on drugs.

12:19.366 --> 12:21.408
As a matter of fact,
we have a couple things in motion.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.531
I was hoping you could help.

12:23.533 --> 12:24.491
Ha, of course why not.

12:24.990 --> 12:27.489
Seems like cleaning up the border's
become my full-time job.

12:27.491 --> 12:28.697
Yeah, mine too.

12:28.699 --> 12:29.783
Excuse me.

12:33.199 --> 12:34.616
- Damn it.
- What is it?

12:35.157 --> 12:37.199
A complication we don't need.

12:37.449 --> 12:40.906
- One of yours?
- A guy who used to work for me.

12:40.908 --> 12:42.366
Uh, look I'm going
to get a hold of your office.

12:42.658 --> 12:44.449
Let's find a way
we can work together, huh?

13:07.699 --> 13:09.614
You are no common thief.

13:11.533 --> 13:13.241
You have an official visitor.

13:13.825 --> 13:15.074
Tell me who you are!

13:15.825 --> 13:19.449
His name is Jack Smiley, American Embassy.

13:20.074 --> 13:23.032
Need a couple of minutes with him,
official business, you know the drill.

13:41.533 --> 13:43.072
How could you be so dumb?

13:43.074 --> 13:46.364
This, now, trying to rip off one
of the Capitan's men.

13:46.366 --> 13:47.697
Look, I had a plan.

13:47.699 --> 13:50.155
A plan. Since when do you ever
work off a plan?

13:50.157 --> 13:52.658
You never ran anything up a chain
of command when you worked for me.

13:56.366 --> 14:00.574
The agency, and the United States
of America have a vested interest

14:01.032 --> 14:03.197
in the stability of our neighbors.

14:03.199 --> 14:06.988
They are far better, far better equipped
to determine what is best

14:06.990 --> 14:08.656
for regional stability than you.

14:08.658 --> 14:12.825
We do not need tourists running around
meddling in local affairs.

14:13.990 --> 14:17.032
Listen, Capitan is doubling
his production.

14:18.157 --> 14:20.406
He'll be bringing him a product
that I've never...

14:20.408 --> 14:22.990
Oh, so this was a righteous robbery,
is that what you're trying to tell me?

14:23.324 --> 14:25.074
So, what's the agency doing about this?

14:25.408 --> 14:29.364
And your big plan
was to bring down the Capitan

14:29.366 --> 14:32.616
by robbing one of his bakers
in a bathroom?

14:32.907 --> 14:34.907
Well, seemed like a good place to start.

14:36.241 --> 14:37.656
You're insane.

14:37.658 --> 14:39.741
Maybe, but...

14:40.032 --> 14:43.408
I've been called worse,
even by you.

14:45.533 --> 14:48.074
You're being extradited hot shot.

14:50.116 --> 14:52.741
For what? What attempted robbery?

14:53.408 --> 14:55.947
They're sending you to one
of the worst prisons in Mexico.

14:55.949 --> 14:58.408
Being an American
will not be a good thing in there.

14:59.824 --> 15:02.406
You survive those three days,
I'll speak to the Senator.

15:02.408 --> 15:04.531
I'll see what he can do
to get you back to the United States.

15:04.533 --> 15:07.116
You face the music,
it's the best I can do.

15:09.907 --> 15:11.199
Okay, all right.

15:12.116 --> 15:14.700
So, um, Price, what do you know
about this prison?

15:39.782 --> 15:41.782
You are nothing but a rat!

15:42.990 --> 15:44.241
You're a rat.

15:45.324 --> 15:46.739
And like a rat you are going to die...

15:46.741 --> 15:47.782
Am I interrupting?

15:50.116 --> 15:52.865
My love, not at all.

15:56.366 --> 16:00.157
I thought you'd like to see the color
of the napkins for the main table.

16:07.282 --> 16:09.658
I think this one is happier.

16:10.782 --> 16:14.740
Will your friend be joining us
for the party tomorrow? I need to know.

16:25.907 --> 16:27.241
He'll be leaving us today.

16:31.824 --> 16:32.824
Okay.

17:56.865 --> 17:58.282
You're dead meat, gringo.

19:07.116 --> 19:08.282
Cozy.

19:20.366 --> 19:22.865
Hey Billy, look at all this cash.

19:28.657 --> 19:30.032
Well, it doesn't matter.

19:31.573 --> 19:33.988
Look at where he's hiding it.
There's no way we're getting in there.

19:33.990 --> 19:35.740
Maybe that's why he got himself arrested.

19:36.573 --> 19:39.032
Well, maybe it's time you break up
with Jack.

19:40.990 --> 19:43.366
Oh, maybe that's why
he didn't tell us sooner.

19:45.199 --> 19:46.199
Look...

19:47.074 --> 19:49.822
if you want to go follow him
into an early grave,

19:49.824 --> 19:51.157
fine, do it, be my guest.

19:51.740 --> 19:53.239
But not me, I'm done, I'm out.

19:53.241 --> 19:55.116
Hey, hey, you're not getting off
that easy.

19:58.449 --> 19:59.699
Let me call Price.

20:02.408 --> 20:05.116
Every time I say no,
I still keep getting sucked back in.

20:34.032 --> 20:35.282
It's my table.

20:38.490 --> 20:39.573
Really?

20:40.824 --> 20:42.241
Aren't they all the same?

21:05.116 --> 21:07.532
Honestly, that really hurt.

22:25.157 --> 22:26.573
My love,

22:27.907 --> 22:29.990
you've done a great job as always.

22:30.657 --> 22:32.074
This party's going to be a success.

22:32.448 --> 22:34.282
I know how important it is for you.

22:40.490 --> 22:42.074
Is there something else?

22:42.865 --> 22:44.074
Something is wrong.

22:48.032 --> 22:50.282
No, everything is okay.

22:52.782 --> 22:54.407
This is a big deal.

22:55.490 --> 22:56.782
That's all.

23:00.824 --> 23:02.282
Things are changing.

23:04.990 --> 23:06.282
I need this.

23:09.116 --> 23:11.157
You know all matters is this family.

23:12.448 --> 23:14.615
- None of this matters.
- I know.

23:15.740 --> 23:16.949
I know that.

23:21.490 --> 23:22.698
Okay.

23:34.907 --> 23:36.573
- Sir.
- Yes.

23:37.532 --> 23:39.573
We are increasing security
for the party tonight.

23:41.323 --> 23:43.613
- Is there a problem?
- Nothing so far, sir.

23:43.615 --> 23:44.990
We're just being more cautious.

23:49.782 --> 23:54.365
I know you like to meet everybody
that works for you. This is Hector.

23:54.824 --> 23:56.782
I appreciate the opportunity, sir.

24:02.615 --> 24:04.698
- American?
- Yes, sir.

24:07.949 --> 24:10.782
- It's okay.
- Let's go.

24:42.116 --> 24:45.907
I'm here
to see the American patient.

24:48.407 --> 24:50.114
I'll have to frisk you.

24:50.116 --> 24:51.824
They've never asked me before.

24:59.824 --> 25:01.365
That wasn't so bad, was it?

25:04.281 --> 25:06.780
Wait. You can't take that.

25:06.782 --> 25:08.863
They're my work instruments.

25:08.865 --> 25:11.072
Nope, it's the new policy.

25:17.365 --> 25:20.030
Hi. We are the electricians.

25:20.032 --> 25:22.321
- Where is your equipment?
- Right here in the truck.

25:22.323 --> 25:23.532
Wait at the door.

25:50.824 --> 25:52.530
Are you okay, Doctor?

26:01.116 --> 26:03.532
- A nail.
- Gracias.

26:24.573 --> 26:26.865
Is this the place
you need to be?

26:29.490 --> 26:32.613
Hey! Is this the right place?

26:32.615 --> 26:38.156
Um, excuse him. He doesn't speak Spanish.
He's a refugee. You know how they are.

26:43.365 --> 26:45.072
We have to help them, right?

26:45.074 --> 26:46.615
He's a big one.

26:52.573 --> 26:54.198
What are these tanks for?

26:56.156 --> 26:58.738
To clean the air ducts. Don't worry.

26:58.740 --> 27:01.198
We'll have the system back up in no time.

27:07.615 --> 27:09.949
Okay.

27:24.573 --> 27:25.657
Okay, we're in.

27:36.782 --> 27:40.407
This is no way
to treat an injured patient. Please go.

27:41.407 --> 27:42.698
Go. Please. Now.

27:51.240 --> 27:54.657
Hey, hey Norma,
what the hell are you doing here?

27:55.323 --> 27:56.323
Saving your life.

27:57.532 --> 27:59.279
Next time you try to keep me in the dark...

27:59.281 --> 28:01.657
Look, I told Price not
to get you involved.

28:01.865 --> 28:03.613
Well, you can't get rid of me that easy.

28:03.615 --> 28:05.822
We're partners, or did you forget that?

28:05.824 --> 28:07.532
No, of course not.

28:10.323 --> 28:11.573
Fuck.

28:12.865 --> 28:15.281
- Ouch.
- I'm sorry.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.238
Look, I didn't want you
to get hurt, that's...

28:20.240 --> 28:21.907
That's why I couldn't say anything.

28:23.323 --> 28:25.905
Well, I'm here now.

28:25.907 --> 28:27.240
Yeah, I can see that.

28:27.865 --> 28:30.657
- Where's Billy?
- On his way.

28:31.156 --> 28:32.115
Okay.

28:34.907 --> 28:37.824
- Is the foot locker in the armory?
- It's there.

28:39.156 --> 28:42.115
All right. Let's do this.

28:47.407 --> 28:49.448
Billy, I'm in, 20 seconds for the gas.

28:49.699 --> 28:50.949
We're in place.

28:53.156 --> 28:55.532
Wait, the gas. Don't you need...

28:57.115 --> 28:58.115
Masks.

29:01.115 --> 29:02.073
Nice job.

29:02.782 --> 29:07.073
That little stunt back at the restaurant,
you can't keep pulling shit like that.

29:07.657 --> 29:10.488
I'm sorry, I had to get myself thrown
into this place to...

29:10.490 --> 29:11.780
to pull this off, you know.

29:11.782 --> 29:15.699
Well, how about some stability?
Next time you won't be right.

29:16.824 --> 29:18.573
Probably in a place like this.

29:19.240 --> 29:20.238
Excuse me.

29:22.323 --> 29:24.115
We're not getting any younger.

29:24.323 --> 29:26.657
I think it's time for you to take things
to the next level.

29:26.948 --> 29:29.699
Can we talk about this
after we steal 20 million dollars?

29:32.448 --> 29:34.407
Twenty million, that's all?

29:34.989 --> 29:39.029
Yeah, but we're stealing it
from the most notorious drug lord

29:39.031 --> 29:39.865
on the planet.

29:40.657 --> 29:43.156
You... always something.

29:52.365 --> 29:53.532
Good night, folks.

30:26.240 --> 30:27.699
The gas is not working.

30:33.198 --> 30:35.740
Give it 30 seconds. I'll get Billy.

30:43.532 --> 30:45.573
Fullington cameras are dark.

31:04.573 --> 31:05.864
Go get him, Tank.

31:11.906 --> 31:13.782
Lock the gate. Lock the gate.

31:19.532 --> 31:20.823
Lock the prison down!

32:25.198 --> 32:26.615
- Ah.
- Okay.

33:01.323 --> 33:02.615
Tank, that's enough.

33:03.115 --> 33:04.657
Tank, that's enough, man.

33:05.073 --> 33:06.156
<i>Get him inside.</i>

33:20.490 --> 33:24.864
Mask off, guys. Gas is gone,
we control the entire prison.

33:25.073 --> 33:26.530
One of the guards hit the panic button.

33:26.532 --> 33:30.156
Aw, shit. I'm gonna have
to cut through that.

33:31.532 --> 33:34.238
So only thing that's stopping us
from 20 million dollars is one door?

33:34.240 --> 33:36.490
One giant door.
Four inches of steal at least.

33:37.281 --> 33:38.696
Well, why don't we wake up
one of the guards,

33:38.698 --> 33:40.946
- get them to give us the combo?
- That's not going to work.

33:40.948 --> 33:43.490
Once that button's pushed
that shit's in lockdown.

33:44.031 --> 33:45.115
How long?

33:45.698 --> 33:47.115
Twelve, twenty four hours.

33:48.615 --> 33:50.281
It all depends on how they set it up.

33:51.073 --> 33:53.198
All right, Tank, go make sure
the guards are tied up.

33:54.115 --> 33:55.240
You got it.

33:56.115 --> 33:59.365
It's going to take me like,
two or three hours to cut through it.

33:59.823 --> 34:02.823
That's okay,
guards shift change is at 6:00 AM.

34:03.989 --> 34:08.031
Hey Norma, try these on. Change of plans,
I'm going to be here for a while.

34:08.364 --> 34:09.989
- Get to it, Billy.
- Yes, sir.

34:12.114 --> 34:13.281
You got that phone?

34:23.447 --> 34:26.279
Price, why the hell did you send
Norma and Billy?

34:26.281 --> 34:29.864
Hell, you try stopping her,
she's ex-FARC, guerrilla warfare.

34:30.322 --> 34:31.906
Don't remind me of Venezuela.

34:32.239 --> 34:34.612
Yeah, Jack, you turned
that into a real shit show.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.446
That better not be happening now.

34:36.447 --> 34:38.862
Yeah, well,
there was a slight complication.

34:38.864 --> 34:41.532
Jack, I told you no screw ups.

34:42.239 --> 34:44.614
You gave me three days.
I'll be out of here in two.

34:45.447 --> 34:48.407
All right, what are the complications?

34:48.697 --> 34:51.906
We have to cut through the armory door,
should take no more than a couple hours.

34:52.532 --> 34:55.321
Well, if the Capitan finds out
that you're in there,

34:55.322 --> 34:57.530
<i>we're all in deep shit.
You do understand that?</i>

34:57.532 --> 34:59.156
Wanna get Hector sitting on his house?

35:00.823 --> 35:02.240
Capitan gets a call I'll get a call.

35:02.490 --> 35:05.948
Whoa, what Hector?
That little thief. Jesus Christ, Jack.

35:06.156 --> 35:10.198
Look... You guys are on your own in there.
I can't help you.

35:10.989 --> 35:13.614
What else is new? Thanks for the reminder.

35:26.281 --> 35:28.031
Sorry, I had to take that.

35:28.864 --> 35:30.281
No problem.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.614
Me and my drink are fine.

35:36.156 --> 35:39.240
So, I hear the Capitan is in town.

35:39.906 --> 35:41.073
That's right.

35:44.864 --> 35:48.448
He's throwing a big party
for his associates from Bogotá.

35:50.031 --> 35:51.739
Now there's a big deal going down.

35:55.115 --> 35:56.823
Now you didn't hear that from me.

35:59.281 --> 36:00.323
Hear what?

36:22.698 --> 36:24.572
Nice doing business with you, mate.

36:33.198 --> 36:34.323
<i>Tank, come in.</i>

36:40.531 --> 36:41.698
Come in.

36:46.656 --> 36:48.073
Check the monitors.

36:50.489 --> 36:51.823
Tank, come in.

37:01.739 --> 37:02.781
Come in, Tank.

37:05.823 --> 37:08.489
- Tank?
- Are you going alone?

37:11.614 --> 37:12.656
Apparently.

37:14.323 --> 37:15.531
Keep trying him.

37:17.739 --> 37:18.614
Tank, come in.

37:27.281 --> 37:29.031
Tank, come in.

37:30.365 --> 37:31.614
Tank, come in.

37:32.614 --> 37:34.781
Copy. What's up?

37:35.156 --> 37:36.821
Where have you been?

37:36.823 --> 37:38.240
I had to change.

37:38.531 --> 37:41.572
Meet Jack by the K10 entrance
for a delivery ASAP.

37:45.489 --> 37:46.698
On my way.

37:51.698 --> 37:54.821
Hey, who's idea was it to not bring guns?

37:54.823 --> 37:59.113
Mine. Nobody dies here.
And next time answer your radio.

37:59.115 --> 38:00.698
Sure thing, boss.

38:01.365 --> 38:02.864
Norma, open the door.

38:16.948 --> 38:18.198
Just in case.

38:20.240 --> 38:22.737
By the way, who's money
are we stealing anyway?

38:22.739 --> 38:24.572
Billy wouldn't say.

38:25.073 --> 38:26.570
He doesn't know.

38:26.572 --> 38:29.198
The only guy around here with that kind
of cash is Capitan.

38:30.156 --> 38:32.614
- Why'd you ask?
- Trust.

38:32.864 --> 38:35.031
I want to see what kind
of man I'm working with.

38:37.698 --> 38:39.489
Did I pass your little test?

38:40.115 --> 38:41.281
For now.

38:44.823 --> 38:48.989
The money stays where it is,
until I get what we agreed upon,

38:50.031 --> 38:51.363
and I need it quickly.

38:51.365 --> 38:53.404
<i>Don't worry,
I'm working on it.</i>

38:53.406 --> 38:54.531
You better.

38:56.447 --> 38:57.739
There's a lot at stake.

39:05.698 --> 39:07.323
<i>So, let me get this straight.</i>

39:08.906 --> 39:12.323
A giant white guy came

39:13.073 --> 39:15.279
and robbed my accountant,

39:15.281 --> 39:19.948
while he was banging
a waitress in the bathroom.

39:21.156 --> 39:22.489
Yes, sir.

39:23.948 --> 39:25.781
And where were you
while this was happening?

39:27.156 --> 39:32.404
Well, he wanted privacy
and there was a soccer game on, and...

39:32.406 --> 39:34.447
Oh, please! A soccer game?

39:35.447 --> 39:36.531
What else?

39:38.572 --> 39:39.781
They stole money, I guess.

39:41.322 --> 39:47.529
You're trying to tell me that a guy
that has worked for me for ten years

39:47.531 --> 39:49.946
would just disappear
from the face of the Earth

39:49.948 --> 39:52.322
that the Police Chief can't even find him.

39:52.864 --> 39:55.989
And he would do all that because he lost
some cash and credit cards?

39:56.656 --> 39:57.739
Please!

39:59.906 --> 40:01.073
What else was stolen?

40:02.031 --> 40:03.073
A disk.

40:06.447 --> 40:07.698
What kind of disk?

40:09.656 --> 40:10.989
A small disk drive.

40:18.115 --> 40:20.737
A disk he wore around his neck?

40:20.739 --> 40:22.823
Yes, sir.

40:32.156 --> 40:34.322
Get the hell out of here! Get out now!

40:49.322 --> 40:52.240
I want you to bring me
that fucking gringo.

40:53.073 --> 40:55.031
I want you to bring me that disk.

40:55.656 --> 40:58.406
We searched him, he did not have a disk.

41:00.115 --> 41:03.447
And, um, he was transferred.

41:05.489 --> 41:07.322
What do you mean, transferred?

41:09.489 --> 41:12.489
The big prison.

41:21.531 --> 41:22.946
We're being robbed.

41:45.364 --> 41:46.739
Where did you find Tank?

41:47.698 --> 41:50.614
He's ex-special forces.
A couple of friends knew him.

41:51.572 --> 41:53.154
What did you see about him before?

41:53.156 --> 41:56.073
He beat the living shit out of this guard
in the parking lot.

41:58.239 --> 42:00.864
- They'll kill you.
- I can take them, come on.

42:01.364 --> 42:02.656
Of course, you could.

43:13.364 --> 43:15.487
- Hector.
- Yes, sir.

43:15.489 --> 43:17.155
- It's Hector, right?
- Yes, sir.

43:18.239 --> 43:20.614
- How is everything out here?
- Good, all secure.

43:21.280 --> 43:23.280
- Everything fine?
- Yes, sir, secure.

43:25.073 --> 43:28.322
You know, Hector, I like to make sure that

43:28.948 --> 43:32.155
I get to know well
everyone that works for me,

43:33.447 --> 43:34.572
and you are new.

43:36.073 --> 43:37.864
So, I thought we could have a little chat.

43:39.864 --> 43:40.781
Okay.

43:41.656 --> 43:42.698
Sit.

43:49.989 --> 43:52.322
You know, I've hired <i>gringos</i> before.

43:53.489 --> 43:57.698
Ex-military, crooked cops, guys like that.

43:59.155 --> 44:03.072
There's something about them.
They are loyal.

44:05.364 --> 44:08.698
They don't think too much
about themselves, they seem focused.

44:11.280 --> 44:12.656
You seem focused.

44:15.114 --> 44:18.155
- I kind of like you, Hector.
- Thank you, sir.

44:22.531 --> 44:23.698
Military or cop?

44:25.447 --> 44:27.445
Navy. I was a kid.

44:27.447 --> 44:29.739
Really? Me too.

44:30.280 --> 44:32.197
- Mexican Marina, Marines.
- Nice.

44:33.656 --> 44:35.072
Why do you think they call me Capitan.

44:36.364 --> 44:37.447
What about you?

44:38.572 --> 44:39.656
Sir?

44:42.406 --> 44:43.906
What rank were you?

44:45.406 --> 44:47.570
I was just a sailor.
I didn't really... it was a long time ago...

44:47.572 --> 44:48.489
Lieutenant.

44:49.823 --> 44:52.155
- Sir.
- First lieutenant, to be accurate.

44:55.155 --> 44:57.989
First lieutenant, special warfare command.

44:59.114 --> 45:00.614
Navy Seal.

45:02.030 --> 45:05.364
Seal Team Two, to be exact.

45:14.322 --> 45:16.447
Maybe you don't remember, you were a kid.

45:17.447 --> 45:18.572
Anyway...

45:20.239 --> 45:21.239
Iraq,

45:22.280 --> 45:23.364
Afghanistan,

45:25.239 --> 45:26.239
Columbia.

45:27.572 --> 45:28.614
Remember there?

45:30.364 --> 45:31.781
I was in Columbia.

45:33.447 --> 45:35.948
The jungles.

45:38.114 --> 45:39.906
It was a crazy place then.

45:41.072 --> 45:42.197
Wasn't it?

45:45.406 --> 45:47.114
You know who else was there,

45:47.572 --> 45:50.322
running around like a bunch of assholes?

45:52.364 --> 45:53.572
DEA.

45:56.406 --> 45:59.823
When they weren't giving me
and my associates a hard time,

46:02.239 --> 46:03.947
they were always recruiting.

46:05.864 --> 46:08.155
They loved special forces.

46:09.239 --> 46:12.614
Delta, Rangers, Navy Seals.

46:17.239 --> 46:20.572
They must have tried to get you
to join them at some point.

46:21.322 --> 46:22.239
Didn't they?

46:23.239 --> 46:24.489
That's a long time ago.

46:26.906 --> 46:27.906
Yeah,

46:29.656 --> 46:30.823
long time ago.

46:41.030 --> 46:43.322
You realize that there is, uh,

46:45.364 --> 46:49.114
a dignity in what is going to happen
to you now, right?

46:51.322 --> 46:53.489
That's why you have to accept it.

46:54.781 --> 46:56.114
No begging,

46:57.823 --> 46:59.155
no pleading.

47:01.489 --> 47:04.988
Hector, there is no mercy.

47:06.155 --> 47:10.821
Not for you, not for your friends
inside my jail,

47:10.823 --> 47:12.364
trying to steal my money.

47:19.072 --> 47:21.861
No mercy, no way out.

47:21.863 --> 47:24.656
- Capitan, may be...
- Hector...

47:26.781 --> 47:27.739
Dignity,

47:29.447 --> 47:30.947
acceptance.

48:10.863 --> 48:11.988
Don't pick it up.

48:14.239 --> 48:15.531
What if it's for one of the guards?

48:18.322 --> 48:19.364
Okay.

48:22.863 --> 48:24.072
<i>Hola, buenos dias.</i>

48:26.863 --> 48:27.947
Who are you?

48:32.072 --> 48:33.239
<i>So it's you.</i>

48:35.947 --> 48:37.322
I know you're in there.

48:38.489 --> 48:39.697
Hector's dead,

48:41.447 --> 48:44.364
and if you take my money,
you're dead, too.

48:46.656 --> 48:47.988
All of you.

48:50.364 --> 48:51.780
Do you hear me?

48:54.322 --> 48:55.447
Dead.

49:06.030 --> 49:07.364
How bad is it?

49:08.364 --> 49:09.863
They know we're here.

49:28.822 --> 49:29.905
Hector's gone.

49:31.406 --> 49:33.697
Shit man, poor bastard.

49:34.863 --> 49:36.736
What are you going to do?

49:36.738 --> 49:38.364
Find out who's coming for us.

49:39.531 --> 49:40.531
Back to work.

50:05.614 --> 50:07.572
Hey, gringo.

50:12.738 --> 50:14.114
You got a mean left hook.

50:15.406 --> 50:16.572
You, too.

50:18.656 --> 50:20.572
I guess you're in over your head, huh?

50:21.822 --> 50:23.072
Why would you say that?

50:25.656 --> 50:29.030
Everyone knows about the armor, the money.

50:33.531 --> 50:36.114
It's just that no one ever thought
of robbing it before.

50:38.364 --> 50:39.447
You know why?

50:41.322 --> 50:44.155
Because no one steals from the Capitan
and lives to tell.

50:48.239 --> 50:49.696
Mexican Marinas.

50:57.905 --> 50:59.280
US Marine Corp.

51:01.030 --> 51:02.114
Semper Fi.

51:03.738 --> 51:05.197
He was a sniper.

51:13.738 --> 51:15.447
Ah, sometimes I wish I was back.

51:17.780 --> 51:19.030
It was easier then.

51:20.780 --> 51:21.863
The Cartel?

51:26.738 --> 51:28.197
Did you work for Capitan?

51:29.280 --> 51:30.280
Five years.

51:31.030 --> 51:32.696
How else you think I wind up in here?

51:33.822 --> 51:35.905
We had one of those difference of opinion.

51:38.780 --> 51:39.822
I need some help,

51:41.863 --> 51:42.947
information.

51:45.822 --> 51:47.364
I'll give you the keys when we leave.

51:48.197 --> 51:49.364
What do you want to know?

51:50.364 --> 51:51.780
Who's he sending next?

51:58.072 --> 51:59.489
They're called the operators.

52:00.322 --> 52:02.780
Military trained true killers.

52:03.655 --> 52:07.197
Once they get a contract,
you die, or they die trying.

52:09.155 --> 52:10.239
Terrific.

52:11.030 --> 52:12.571
Bet you they're already on their way.

52:15.280 --> 52:18.447
And that, my friend,
is not going to stop them.

52:24.571 --> 52:25.863
Thanks.

52:35.780 --> 52:38.406
Hey Billy, how much longer?

52:38.613 --> 52:39.905
Forty-five minutes, tops.

52:41.364 --> 52:43.114
We're going to get company, be careful.

52:43.696 --> 52:44.822
Should we just blow it?

52:46.655 --> 52:50.406
- Too risky. Fireball could burn the money.
- Got it.

52:52.571 --> 52:55.155
- You seen Tank?
- I thought he was with you.

52:57.822 --> 53:00.320
- Maybe he's got his own agenda.
- Who?

53:00.322 --> 53:02.489
Tank, the big guy. I don't trust him.

53:05.030 --> 53:06.322
Something isn't right.

53:12.655 --> 53:15.694
You know, maybe we should just forget
about the money.

53:17.030 --> 53:20.571
Walk out of here, get a small apartment,

53:21.905 --> 53:24.447
- open a cafe.
- Jack.

53:25.822 --> 53:27.736
What, I thought you wanted the cafe?

53:27.738 --> 53:30.362
I do, but let's not stop now.

53:30.364 --> 53:31.863
We can do this.

53:34.322 --> 53:37.406
All right, it's your call.

53:40.613 --> 53:43.237
Hey, that's him.

53:43.239 --> 53:45.863
- Where is that?
- The guards locker room.

53:48.655 --> 53:50.072
He already cleared that area.

53:52.571 --> 53:55.863
Hey, thanks.

54:02.364 --> 54:03.488
Jack...

54:06.322 --> 54:08.863
After this we're done. Deal?

54:10.530 --> 54:11.613
Deal.

54:54.613 --> 54:56.988
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, everything's okay.

54:57.364 --> 55:01.197
- Look at me, something is wrong.
- Everything is okay.

55:01.905 --> 55:03.488
I'm working things, okay?

55:07.280 --> 55:08.488
What time is it?

55:10.738 --> 55:12.738
In an hour everything's ready.

55:16.988 --> 55:18.072
I'm sorry.

55:21.863 --> 55:23.197
Thanks for everything.

55:37.363 --> 55:38.655
Tank?

55:39.239 --> 55:40.239
Yeah.

55:43.822 --> 55:44.822
What the hell.

55:45.738 --> 55:48.988
Well, they got lose so I had to do
what I had to do.

55:57.155 --> 55:59.528
- I said no one dies here.
- I had no choice.

55:59.530 --> 56:02.528
- How do you figure?
- This ain't no damn robbery, is it?

56:02.530 --> 56:03.988
Who do you work for?

56:04.780 --> 56:05.988
Nobody.

56:06.655 --> 56:08.405
Bullshit, tell me.

56:11.696 --> 56:14.736
- Are you gonna kill me too now?
- Don't push me.

56:14.738 --> 56:16.114
Jack?

56:17.446 --> 56:18.780
Movement outside.

56:19.905 --> 56:21.571
Can you tell me how many?

56:23.446 --> 56:24.446
Norma?

56:29.363 --> 56:30.905
Jack? Jack!

56:32.280 --> 56:33.571
We're being breached.

56:34.488 --> 56:36.030
- <i>Where?</i>
- North end.

56:36.655 --> 56:38.239
<i>Yeah, all right then.</i>

56:39.822 --> 56:40.655
Norma.

56:44.321 --> 56:47.030
Okay, we have to stop those guys
before they get to the armory.

56:48.571 --> 56:50.446
- Truce?
- For now.

56:52.405 --> 56:53.863
All right, let's go.

56:59.072 --> 57:00.279
Come on.

57:13.363 --> 57:14.571
Norma, you all right?

57:17.905 --> 57:18.947
Good.

57:35.738 --> 57:38.863
- Norma, open all the cells in C block now.
- Copy that.

57:39.613 --> 57:40.697
Do it now!

58:10.655 --> 58:12.030
Where the hell are you?

58:13.114 --> 58:14.530
Can't talk right now.

58:19.363 --> 58:20.863
I got company, guys.

01:02:53.154 --> 01:02:55.613
Let's go, let's go.

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:49.196
Is everyone enjoying dinner?

01:03:49.571 --> 01:03:52.154
I'd like to propose a toast.

01:03:52.863 --> 01:03:56.655
To our new partners...

01:04:17.613 --> 01:04:19.363
- You okay?
- No.

01:04:22.862 --> 01:04:26.697
Hey guys, do we get paid overtime
for this job?

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:29.029
Oh, my God, Billy.

01:04:30.363 --> 01:04:32.029
I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:04:37.946 --> 01:04:40.738
- Hey, hey, you're not a doctor.
- Shut up.

01:04:43.904 --> 01:04:44.862
Where's Tank?

01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:46.987
He took off.

01:04:48.987 --> 01:04:50.488
Piece of shit, man.

01:04:50.862 --> 01:04:52.904
He's been looking for the exit
ever since he got here.

01:04:55.904 --> 01:04:57.279
What do we do now?

01:05:19.821 --> 01:05:21.779
Big bucks inside. Let's get paid.

01:05:27.987 --> 01:05:30.446
- What the hell?
- Where's the money?

01:05:31.405 --> 01:05:32.530
I don't know.

01:05:33.655 --> 01:05:35.113
I just can't believe it.

01:05:43.071 --> 01:05:44.154
We've been setup.

01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:46.113
What do you mean?

01:05:46.405 --> 01:05:47.655
Somebody moved the money.

01:05:49.405 --> 01:05:51.779
That's it, we've got to abort now.

01:05:59.405 --> 01:06:00.363
Shit!

01:07:03.279 --> 01:07:04.902
We should have never taken this job.

01:07:04.904 --> 01:07:06.821
This is not the right time
to discuss this.

01:07:08.655 --> 01:07:11.071
We might not get a chance
to when we're all dead, will we?

01:07:16.904 --> 01:07:18.571
So, what's our exit strategy?

01:07:20.946 --> 01:07:22.737
Norma, help Billy load the truck.

01:07:24.196 --> 01:07:25.279
I'll see you there.

01:07:28.904 --> 01:07:32.154
Yeah, set it up.
I'll meet you at the drop.

01:07:34.405 --> 01:07:35.737
Yeah I got it all.

01:07:45.071 --> 01:07:46.279
Don't hang up.

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:48.904
The phone.

01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:51.196
Easy.

01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:57.154
<i>Tank, can you hear me?</i>

01:07:58.405 --> 01:07:59.737
Loud and clear.

01:08:02.363 --> 01:08:03.862
Yeah, and I'm taking your money.

01:08:05.196 --> 01:08:06.696
<i>Who the hell is this?</i>

01:08:09.488 --> 01:08:11.113
The guy who's got the drop on you.

01:08:16.488 --> 01:08:17.612
Pick them up.

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:19.571
Let's go.

01:08:23.821 --> 01:08:25.363
So who's your phone buddy?

01:08:32.029 --> 01:08:34.571
I'm guessing the guy
who's getting the drugs across the border

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:37.446
to your old hood.

01:08:44.154 --> 01:08:47.279
Nice job, genius. Hope it was worth it.

01:08:48.612 --> 01:08:50.529
I never said I was a good guy.

01:08:57.737 --> 01:09:00.862
Oh, yeah, the guard in the parking lot.

01:09:02.569 --> 01:09:03.946
He moved the money for you, right?

01:09:05.113 --> 01:09:06.696
Finally put it together, huh?

01:09:13.238 --> 01:09:14.904
I'm gonna enjoy this.

01:09:28.612 --> 01:09:30.196
Where'd you learn to fight, Peace Corp?

01:09:39.196 --> 01:09:40.569
Who was on the phone?

01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:46.569
Last chance.

01:10:08.279 --> 01:10:09.570
I'll go with.

01:10:21.363 --> 01:10:22.405
Bye, Tank.

01:10:57.445 --> 01:11:00.612
Well, I think this is the part when I say
I'm getting too old for this shit.

01:11:01.987 --> 01:11:03.405
You okay, man?

01:11:04.029 --> 01:11:05.363
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:05.654 --> 01:11:07.612
I fired Tank. I found these.

01:11:13.987 --> 01:11:16.277
Un-freaking-believable.
So much money, man.

01:11:16.279 --> 01:11:19.612
Forget the cafe,
we're opening a hotel, five stars.

01:11:20.737 --> 01:11:21.987
Something like that.

01:11:24.487 --> 01:11:27.113
I hate to be the person to break up
this tender moment,

01:11:27.612 --> 01:11:29.904
but it's about time we leave.
We got to go make a deposit.

01:11:32.279 --> 01:11:33.487
What the hell?

01:11:34.654 --> 01:11:37.071
Man, I knew it. We're too late.

01:11:38.529 --> 01:11:40.196
The van is ready let's go.

01:11:41.154 --> 01:11:42.404
Wait.

01:11:42.821 --> 01:11:45.779
They didn't cut the power
from here, from the outside.

01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:47.779
Perfect, man.

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:50.779
What are we supposed to do now?

01:11:55.529 --> 01:11:58.071
- Get some help.
- Oh, great idea.

01:11:59.779 --> 01:12:00.904
Any idea who?

01:12:02.363 --> 01:12:03.654
I know a guy.

01:12:10.113 --> 01:12:11.529
What if I asked you to help?

01:12:11.987 --> 01:12:13.404
Why would any of us help you?

01:12:14.612 --> 01:12:16.445
I'll give you five million reasons.

01:12:28.904 --> 01:12:30.238
So what's he sending next?

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:34.445
They call it the bus. It's one
of those buses that we all have here.

01:12:35.029 --> 01:12:36.321
What's in the bus?

01:12:37.154 --> 01:12:39.696
Death. Death itself.

01:12:41.279 --> 01:12:44.404
International assassins
always dressed in black.

01:12:45.279 --> 01:12:48.529
When the operators fail, they don't.

01:12:51.737 --> 01:12:55.154
Hey, Norma, open all of three block.

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.154
Double cross me and I'll kill you.

01:12:59.196 --> 01:13:01.610
- That's fine.
- Let's go.

01:13:21.445 --> 01:13:23.279
You got a plan, my friend?

01:13:50.071 --> 01:13:51.445
Come on, Jack, let's go.

01:14:21.487 --> 01:14:23.113
Fire!

01:14:43.445 --> 01:14:45.154
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.362
Remember me?

01:14:57.237 --> 01:14:59.944
<i>Hey, Norma, you make it</i>
<i>to the meeting point yet?</i>

01:14:59.946 --> 01:15:01.404
No, she's with me, Jack.

01:15:01.946 --> 01:15:03.360
<i>Who is this?</i>

01:15:03.362 --> 01:15:05.320
This is the man who got the drop on you.

01:15:05.946 --> 01:15:11.779
Now, you have my money and, well,
if you want to see your girlfriend again,

01:15:13.404 --> 01:15:15.612
I'll suggest you give it back to me, Jack.

01:15:17.445 --> 01:15:18.654
<i>Just tell me where.</i>

01:15:19.029 --> 01:15:21.696
Good. I knew you'd see things
my way, eventually.

01:15:24.612 --> 01:15:26.362
Lover boy misses you, sweetheart.

01:16:06.237 --> 01:16:08.612
It's nice to know
you can still follow orders, Jack.

01:16:10.696 --> 01:16:12.570
How long you been working with the cartel?

01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:17.652
No. You're looking at that
the wrong way, Jack.

01:16:17.654 --> 01:16:21.237
You see, they pay me for protection.

01:16:21.737 --> 01:16:24.445
I send them my snoopy
little agents like Price

01:16:24.737 --> 01:16:26.694
and well, I get the possible re-election.

01:16:26.696 --> 01:16:28.362
I get the money to build my wall.

01:16:28.737 --> 01:16:30.278
It's a win win, Jack.

01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:34.529
Except the drugs go under your wall
to the kids back home.

01:16:35.112 --> 01:16:38.904
Well, politics, details Jack.

01:16:40.237 --> 01:16:42.946
Now show me my money, please.

01:16:43.904 --> 01:16:45.112
Show me Norma.

01:17:02.362 --> 01:17:05.570
Well, I guess, I underestimated you, Jack.

01:17:06.029 --> 01:17:07.195
Billy.

01:17:17.821 --> 01:17:21.029
I guess I underestimated you, Jack.
Indeed I did, but maybe

01:17:21.862 --> 01:17:26.070
you and I can come to some mutual
beneficial arrangement ourselves.

01:17:26.696 --> 01:17:30.278
You and me Jack, another win win.
Would that be so bad?

01:17:34.821 --> 01:17:36.654
Honestly, yeah.

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:40.278
Okay, may I ask why?

01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:43.987
Because you killed my friend.

01:17:44.821 --> 01:17:46.696
Shot him down like a dog in the street.

01:17:47.612 --> 01:17:51.946
Now, Jack, don't go doing anything
you're going to regret.

01:17:52.362 --> 01:17:53.946
You're out gunned here, okay.

01:17:54.612 --> 01:17:56.153
Because you're above the law?

01:17:57.654 --> 01:18:00.445
Actually, Jack, I am the law.

01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:02.821
I am a US Senator

01:18:03.654 --> 01:18:04.904
and you

01:18:06.362 --> 01:18:09.360
are a thief that got booted from the DEA.

01:18:09.362 --> 01:18:10.445
Go on.

01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:16.028
Jack.

01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:21.068
You were wrong about one thing, Senator.

01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:22.362
Oh, yeah, what's that, Jack?

01:18:24.946 --> 01:18:27.028
I was never kicked out of the DEA.

01:18:36.862 --> 01:18:40.237
It's in the van. You kill him.
Go! Kill him!

01:18:46.737 --> 01:18:47.821
Kill him!

01:18:48.445 --> 01:18:50.110
Get in the car.

01:18:50.112 --> 01:18:51.193
- Get in the car.
- What?

01:18:51.195 --> 01:18:52.946
Where are you going?

01:18:53.445 --> 01:18:54.904
Hey, hey!

01:18:56.862 --> 01:18:58.070
Get back.

01:19:03.821 --> 01:19:04.862
Jack!

01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:10.986
Jack, Jack!

01:19:15.404 --> 01:19:16.570
Jack?

01:19:17.153 --> 01:19:18.404
Don't do this.

01:19:21.404 --> 01:19:24.570
Please. We could still make a deal.

01:19:26.445 --> 01:19:27.904
I'll take it from here.

01:19:30.737 --> 01:19:33.320
Jack, do not leave me here.

01:19:34.529 --> 01:19:36.404
God damn it, Jack, do not.

01:19:38.404 --> 01:19:40.362
Jack!

01:19:41.612 --> 01:19:45.445
Guys, you're looking at
a US Senator, okay?

01:19:45.821 --> 01:19:48.612
Conservative republican.
That's me.

01:19:49.696 --> 01:19:51.570
I am American, God damn it.

01:19:52.779 --> 01:19:54.737
There's a lot of money in that bag,
feel free to take it.

01:19:57.278 --> 01:19:58.612
You work for the Capitan.

01:20:00.821 --> 01:20:03.402
- Okay, what's going on?
- Take him.

01:20:03.404 --> 01:20:07.237
No, no, no. Hey did you not hear
what I'm saying? Jack!

01:20:08.903 --> 01:20:10.779
Jack! Jack!

01:20:11.821 --> 01:20:13.568
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

01:20:13.570 --> 01:20:14.821
<i>Oh, yes, I do.</i>

01:20:15.945 --> 01:20:19.860
<i>I'm dealing with the one who put me
and my guys away for five years</i>

01:20:19.862 --> 01:20:21.696
<i>while you sat in your mansion.</i>

01:20:22.362 --> 01:20:23.903
You've got to be kidding me.

01:20:24.737 --> 01:20:26.112
As a matter of fact,

01:20:26.862 --> 01:20:29.821
<i>some of them are about
to visit you right now.</i>

01:20:35.487 --> 01:20:37.070
<i>Make sure you say hello for me.</i>

01:20:38.612 --> 01:20:39.861
<i>And </i> adios,

01:20:40.487 --> 01:20:41.737
mi <i>Capitan.</i>

01:21:28.654 --> 01:21:30.320
Dignity and acceptance.

01:22:00.903 --> 01:22:02.485
Billy, stop the car.

01:22:02.487 --> 01:22:05.153
Stop the car, Billy. Let me out.

01:22:07.945 --> 01:22:09.153
Let me out.

01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:13.070
Move, move.

01:22:13.696 --> 01:22:15.070
This is bullshit!

01:22:15.487 --> 01:22:18.028
Just stay here man,
I'll handle this. Okay?

01:22:18.986 --> 01:22:20.153
Bullshit.

01:22:22.112 --> 01:22:25.195
Norma, Norma wait, wait. Norma, just stop.

01:22:25.654 --> 01:22:27.612
Come on, you know we had
to give the money back.

01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:29.818
We can't keep the money, just chill.

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.570
This next assignment will be our last one.

01:22:31.861 --> 01:22:33.778
He told me this was the last assignment.

01:22:35.445 --> 01:22:36.568
Well, you know how he is.

01:22:36.570 --> 01:22:38.778
I mean, I've told you to break up with him
like a thousand times.

01:22:46.529 --> 01:22:47.654
Please?

01:22:53.153 --> 01:22:54.362
Please.

01:22:56.612 --> 01:22:57.654
Fine.

01:22:59.736 --> 01:23:02.235
- Here we go again.
- Shut up, Billy.

01:26:24.944 --> 01:26:29.944
