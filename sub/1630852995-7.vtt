07:49.649 --> 07:51.818
Till I came back
for Mama's funeral,

07:51.851 --> 07:54.720
and saw
that John Hunchman

07:54.754 --> 07:58.491
was still in Dicktown,
still smiling for the camera.

07:58.524 --> 08:01.260
- So you stuck around
to ruin my life.

08:01.294 --> 08:04.297
- Yep.
Just like you ruined mine.

08:04.330 --> 08:06.499
But you know what?
I can't do it.

08:06.532 --> 08:10.737
Look at you,
you're broke, fat, and old.

08:10.770 --> 08:12.972
Now you're trapped
in a pit full of hair.

08:13.005 --> 08:15.241
How could I make
your life any worse?

08:15.274 --> 08:16.275
- I don't know.

08:16.309 --> 08:17.910
Maybe set my houseboat on fire?

08:17.944 --> 08:19.378
- What?
I didn't do that.

08:19.412 --> 08:20.680
- Are you kidding?

08:20.713 --> 08:22.515
You're trying
to burn us alive right now.

08:22.548 --> 08:24.383
- [blows raspberry]
You big baby.

08:24.417 --> 08:26.753
That old hair is 100% asbestos.

08:26.786 --> 08:27.820
- Oh.
- Phew.

08:27.854 --> 08:29.522
- Ah, what the hell.

08:29.555 --> 08:30.623
Come on, Hunchman.

08:30.656 --> 08:32.759
Give me a big, old
"I'm sorry,"

08:32.792 --> 08:33.826
and I'll let you out.

08:33.860 --> 08:35.561
- What?
No, I'm not sorry.

08:35.595 --> 08:36.729
- Oh, dude, what the fuck?

08:36.763 --> 08:39.932
- I do not apologize!

08:39.966 --> 08:41.734
- [sighs]
Okay.

08:41.768 --> 08:43.302
Have fun in your pit!

08:46.939 --> 08:49.842
[dramatic music]

08:51.344 --> 08:52.845
- Ugh, push, push--
- All right.

08:52.879 --> 08:54.747
- Push me up, push me up.
- Oh, my God, I'm trying.

08:54.781 --> 08:56.616
- Well, try
a little harder, stupid.

08:56.649 --> 08:57.750
- Hey!
What?

08:57.784 --> 08:59.786
- [grunts]
- How am I stupid?

08:59.819 --> 09:01.621
We could both be out of here
if you had just apologized.

09:01.654 --> 09:03.322
- [scoffs]
Why would I do that?

09:03.356 --> 09:04.757
- Kaydee had it rough.

09:04.791 --> 09:06.726
Even if you still think
she stole that trophy--

09:06.759 --> 09:08.261
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:08.294 --> 09:10.396
She did steal that trophy.
- Okay, but you did

09:10.430 --> 09:12.331
basically get her expelled
and mess up her life.

09:12.365 --> 09:14.801
- No, no, she made
a bunch of bad decisions

09:14.834 --> 09:16.035
that I had nothing to do with.

09:16.068 --> 09:17.603
- I think she's innocent.

09:17.637 --> 09:19.705
- Ha! Then you're even stupider
than I thought

09:19.739 --> 09:21.240
when I called you stupid.

09:21.274 --> 09:22.275
- Excuse me.

09:22.308 --> 09:23.209
[phone beeps]

09:24.410 --> 09:25.745
You think I'm stupid?

09:25.778 --> 09:27.613
- Well, what would you call
someone who lives

09:27.647 --> 09:29.649
in his parents' basement,
who takes life advice

09:29.682 --> 09:31.350
from a random stranger
on YouTube?

09:31.384 --> 09:32.985
- You know, you always
think you're right,

09:33.019 --> 09:34.787
but you're the reason
we're stuck

09:34.821 --> 09:37.023
in this hair pit, stupid.

09:37.056 --> 09:38.791
- Fine, you know what?
Maybe I am stupid.

09:38.825 --> 09:40.259
I mean, I've been trying
to pull you

09:40.293 --> 09:41.761
out of the metaphorical
hair pit of your life

09:41.794 --> 09:43.429
for five years.
- Wow.

09:43.463 --> 09:44.897
- You know,
hiring you out of pity

09:44.931 --> 09:47.433
maybe was the stupidest thing
I ever did.

09:47.467 --> 09:49.535
- [grunts]
- Ah!

09:51.604 --> 09:52.672
- Okay, you know what?

09:52.705 --> 09:54.574
Dr. Marjorie Frost?

09:54.607 --> 09:57.577
The random stranger on YouTube
who gives me life advice...

09:57.610 --> 09:58.778
- All right.
- Who is also

09:58.811 --> 10:00.012
a tenured professor,
which means

10:00.046 --> 10:02.415
it's impossible
for her to be stupid?

10:02.448 --> 10:03.883
- Okay.
- She said something once,

10:03.916 --> 10:05.485
and she's right.

10:05.518 --> 10:08.855
"Don't waste time
with leaf-eating losers.

10:08.888 --> 10:11.791
Soar over them on
your mighty, leathery wings."

10:11.824 --> 10:13.860
Goodbye, stupid.

10:13.893 --> 10:15.795
- Argh.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

10:15.828 --> 10:17.797
Free!
- Okay, great, thank heavens.

10:17.830 --> 10:19.265
Now, let me out.

10:19.298 --> 10:20.566
- [chuckles]
No, I'm gonna go find

10:20.600 --> 10:21.734
Taggy and Heather.

10:21.768 --> 10:22.869
- I--I'm up here, guys.

10:22.902 --> 10:24.904
Just chillin' in this trap.

10:24.937 --> 10:26.773
- David.
David! Wait--

10:26.806 --> 10:30.276
I, uh--I didn't mean
what I said just then.

10:30.309 --> 10:32.879
- You really didn't?
- Uh, heat of the moment.

10:32.912 --> 10:33.946
- Okay, you promise?

10:33.980 --> 10:35.314
- Come on. Please?

10:35.348 --> 10:36.682
- Okay, fine.
Give me your hand.

10:36.716 --> 10:38.418
Psych.
Ohh.

10:38.451 --> 10:40.586
You really do think
I'm stupid.

10:40.620 --> 10:42.422
Fuck you, John.
You're fired.

10:42.455 --> 10:44.690
- Fired?
You can't fire me.

10:44.724 --> 10:47.360
I'm the boss.
I'm in charge.

10:47.393 --> 10:50.396
I am in charge!

10:50.430 --> 10:51.731
[rat squeaking]

10:51.764 --> 10:52.799
[grunts]

11:04.010 --> 11:07.213
Made in Georgia
