Previously on ''Stargate SG-1'';

00:09.880 --> 00:12.160
The exits are sealed, Major.

00:12.240 --> 00:14.240
Who are you?
What the hell am l doing here?

00:14.360 --> 00:19.480
My name is Adrian Conrad.
You're here because of me.

00:19.560 --> 00:24.160
- What was the $3 million for?
- Russian merchandise l sold to Zetatron.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.760
- What?
- A symbiote.

00:25.840 --> 00:30.640
Conrad is in the late stages of a very rare
disorder known as Burchardt's Syndrome.

00:30.760 --> 00:35.520
lt affects the immune system, leaving
the body vulnerable to a host of diseases.

00:35.600 --> 00:40.320
- And there's no known cure.
- Except a symbiote's healing powers.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.400
Where you going?

00:47.200 --> 00:49.920
(distorted) Shoot me
and you'll kill the host.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.720
You wanna live, you come with me.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.520
Once you start delivering
on your end of our bargain,

00:59.640 --> 01:02.240
l might be able to move you
to better accommodations.

01:02.320 --> 01:06.320
You cannot offer anything of equal value
to the knowledge l possess.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.400
l'm not so sure about that.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Major Carter?

01:32.120 --> 01:34.800
My name's Julia Donovan.
l'm with lnside Access.

01:34.920 --> 01:38.000
- Could we have a few minutes?
- l'm a little busy.

01:38.120 --> 01:41.800
Your name came up in connection
with a story l've been working on.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.880
Several billion dollars
of taxpayers' money

01:44.960 --> 01:48.560
has been funnelled into
a secret project called ''Prometheus''.

01:48.680 --> 01:52.640
The government appropriated the money
without congressional oversight,

01:52.720 --> 01:56.320
which l think my viewers
might find rather interesting.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.400
l'm sure they would.

02:00.440 --> 02:05.600
l thought you might find this interesting.
lt's a metal alloy called ''trinium''.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.320
lt's being used
in connection with Prometheus.

02:08.440 --> 02:12.560
l had my experts analyse it. lt's unlike
anything they've ever seen before.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.320
At least on this planet.

02:16.240 --> 02:19.160
Sure you wouldn't care to comment now?

02:19.280 --> 02:20.960
l'm sure.

03:25.400 --> 03:29.280
l didn't know what to say.
She caught me completely off guard.

03:29.400 --> 03:33.000
You did the right thing.
Our official policy is to deny everything.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.560
ln this case, l don't think
it's gonna be good enough.

03:36.680 --> 03:40.160
Do you believe
the sample of trinium is genuine?

03:40.240 --> 03:45.040
lt's hard to say. The fact that she knew the
name indicates a serious security breach.

03:45.120 --> 03:48.000
The Pentagon's already
initiated an investigation.

03:48.120 --> 03:51.880
We've tapped her phone and email.
We're tracking her movements.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.920
- Where is she now?
- She left Colorado Springs at 0930.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.720
She changed planes in Denver
en route to JFK.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.760
l'm sending Major Davis over
to talk to her.

04:01.880 --> 04:05.600
- When is this report scheduled to air?
- ln four days.

04:15.200 --> 04:19.680
Tuesday's no good. l've got an interview
with the Chinese ambassador.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.840
And then on Wednesday
l fly out for the G8 summit.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.320
l'll call you back.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.440
Why are we stopping?

04:33.080 --> 04:35.440
- Good evening.
- What is this?

04:35.520 --> 04:39.120
Major Paul Davis,
United States Air Force.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.280
You can't intimidate me
out of running my story.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.040
The fact that you're here
tells me it's important.

04:45.160 --> 04:49.000
- lt's more important than you know.
- Here's the national security speech.

04:49.080 --> 04:54.000
No, no speech. Just a simple fact. You run
that story, you endanger people's lives.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.720
All right. You tell me what
Prometheus is and l'll reconsider.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.560
- l don't think so.
- l'm serious.

05:01.680 --> 05:06.000
l have reports that it's a fusion reactor
they're building out in the desert.

05:06.120 --> 05:09.120
- Where'd you hear that?
- l'm not ready to reveal my source.

05:09.200 --> 05:15.000
By revealing classified information, your
source is violating about 1 7 federal laws.

05:15.120 --> 05:18.480
- ls that a confirmation?
- lt's a warning.

05:20.680 --> 05:25.840
l've made arrangements. lf anything
happens to me, the report gets released.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.440
Have a good evening, Ms Donovan.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.800
- She's stubborn, sir.
- Where did the leak come from?

05:44.880 --> 05:47.840
We're working on it,
but so far we've got nothing.

05:47.960 --> 05:53.360
lt could be anything from a technician
working on the project to Senator Kinsey.

05:53.480 --> 05:57.000
- How much does she know?
- She thinks Prometheus is a reactor.

05:57.800 --> 06:02.320
- Then maybe we don't have a problem.
- She has a money trail and the trinium.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.760
lf she can get that much,
odds are she can get a lot more.

06:10.360 --> 06:13.760
This is General Hammond.
Get me the president.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.960
Al, we need to talk about
this production schedule.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.240
- What the hell is this?
- Take it easy.

06:26.360 --> 06:29.520
You can't kill my story
by going over my head.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.960
Just sit down, please.

06:39.560 --> 06:45.680
The head office has decided that it is
in their best interests not to run the story.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.600
They caved.

06:47.680 --> 06:52.000
lt was a personal request from the
president to the chairman of this network.

06:52.560 --> 06:56.080
- l don't believe this.
- We need all the material you have.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.280
- Tapes, notes...
- You can't force me to give you anything.

06:59.360 --> 07:02.640
Actually, we can,
but we were hoping that you'd cooperate,

07:02.720 --> 07:05.000
given that your story is dead.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.120
That's where you're wrong.

07:07.200 --> 07:11.200
All l have to do is call some foreign
broadcasters. They'd be very interested.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.600
- l'd advise against it.
- OK, OK.

07:13.720 --> 07:16.080
Maybe there's a compromise here.

07:17.040 --> 07:21.120
Whatever this thing is,
l figure it's too big to stay secret for ever.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.280
Eventually, you're gonna go public.

07:24.400 --> 07:28.400
You let Julia take a camera crew
to document Prometheus - top to bottom.

07:28.520 --> 07:31.680
When the time is right,
we get a world exclusive.

07:32.560 --> 07:36.000
- l don't think so.
- We'll sign a nondisclosure agreement.

07:36.120 --> 07:39.920
The video tape will be your property.
You'll be in complete control.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.920
Forget it. They're gonna sit on it

07:42.000 --> 07:46.160
When the President of the United States
kills your story, that's it. Game over.

07:46.280 --> 07:50.400
You go foreign with this,
they could charge you with treason.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.120
(Jonas) You think
she'd go through with it?

07:57.240 --> 08:00.000
We have no way of knowing.
We can't take the chance.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.160
And where's she getting her information?

08:02.280 --> 08:06.160
lf we kill the story without plugging
the leak, this could happen again.

08:06.280 --> 08:10.040
- (Jonas) What are you suggesting?
- Her producer will reveal the source

08:10.160 --> 08:12.720
in exchange for a tour of the facility.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.440
The Pentagon feels
this will contain the situation.

08:15.560 --> 08:20.560
Once we have the source, we destroy
all video tape and any related materials.

08:20.680 --> 08:24.000
- So we're double-crossing her.
- We have no choice.

08:24.120 --> 08:28.960
Without evidence, the only place she'll be
able to run the story is in the tabloids.

08:29.080 --> 08:33.280
This is an insanely bad idea.

08:33.400 --> 08:37.520
The decision's been made. Major,
l want you and Jonas to take care of this.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.640
Yes, sir.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.640
Dismissed.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.560
Ms Donovan.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.080
Major.

09:14.680 --> 09:18.200
This is Jonas Quinn.
He'll be joining us on the tour.

09:19.560 --> 09:22.920
l guess a couple of billion dollars
doesn't buy what it used to.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.360
You'd be surprised.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.200
Shall we?

09:54.880 --> 09:59.280
- (Donovan) How far down are we going?
- (Carter) Several hundred feet.

10:09.520 --> 10:13.800
This is Prometheus,
otherwise known as the X-303.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.640
Hope you brought a lot of tape.

10:43.600 --> 10:49.120
lt would take at least 20 Saturn rockets to
get this off the ground, let alone into orbit.

10:49.240 --> 10:55.120
This is the third in a series of designs that
incorporates human and alien technology.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.800
Little green men helped you build this?

10:57.880 --> 11:01.600
Actually, they're grey.
Key systems were reverse-engineered

11:01.720 --> 11:06.000
from a ship that crashed 100 miles
north of Fairbanks, Alaska in 1978.

11:06.080 --> 11:10.880
lt was only recently that our technology
could take advantage of what we had.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.560
Fairbanks?

11:17.320 --> 11:19.280
Better than Roswell.

11:21.040 --> 11:25.360
- lt doesn't look very alien to me.
- The controls are all standard design.

11:25.440 --> 11:29.440
Some of the key systems use crystal
technology rather than wires and chips.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.320
The hard part's making them compatible.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.880
All right, let's set up in here.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.200
l'd like to see more.

11:43.320 --> 11:47.040
The ship will be capable of
reaching orbit in under 30 seconds.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.120
What about G-forces?

11:49.240 --> 11:54.640
With the inertial dampeners and artificial
gravity, it'll feel like a ride in an elevator.

11:54.760 --> 11:57.920
- How long until this thing is ready to fly?
- lt'll be a while.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.600
A number of the support systems
are still being assembled.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.520
What are you doing?

12:40.480 --> 12:43.040
- What is this?
- The engine room.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.880
- How fast does it go?
- Using sublight engines,

13:01.000 --> 13:06.120
the ship can accelerate to 1 10,000 miles
per second - over half the speed of light.

13:06.200 --> 13:11.760
lt's not fast enough to achieve interstellar
travel. For that, we need the hyperdrive.

13:33.840 --> 13:35.840
(beeping)

13:45.640 --> 13:47.840
(beeping)

13:50.120 --> 13:52.400
- What is it?
- l'm not sure.

13:52.520 --> 13:56.560
The computer was running hyperdrive
simulations. They've been interrupted.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.160
So?

13:58.240 --> 14:01.200
So there are no other tests
scheduled for today.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.480
Engine room to the bridge.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.880
Sergeant Gibson,
this is Major Carter. Come in.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.480
Maybe the com system isn't finished yet.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.080
All right.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.960
l'll go check it out.
Keep an eye on these two.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.800
l think l got it.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.320
We're in business.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.400
Go get the others.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.240
- Major Carter.
- You're supposed to be on the bridge.

14:48.320 --> 14:52.960
We had trouble with the equipment.
We need another battery from the truck.

15:11.880 --> 15:15.280
- What is it?
- Someone's trying to lock down the ship.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.880
l can't stop 'em,
but l think l can slow 'em down.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.800
- Where is she?
- This way.

15:38.280 --> 15:41.280
- Jones, come in.
- Go ahead.

15:41.400 --> 15:45.280
l need you to seal a room for me-
Charlie Charlie 4107.

15:48.560 --> 15:49.520
Done.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.600
Let's go.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.480
Full diagnostic?

16:00.600 --> 16:02.560
No, no, no.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.720
- What is that?
- The control crystal.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.400
This is Major Carter.
Can anybody hear me?

16:29.040 --> 16:31.200
- What the hell's going on?
- Shut up.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.680
Over there.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.840
- Smith, come in.
- Go ahead.

16:35.960 --> 16:39.520
We got a problem. The computer's
tied up with a diagnostic program.

16:39.640 --> 16:42.000
l need you to shut it down.

16:42.120 --> 16:44.080
Yeah, we got it.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.640
- The controls are frozen.
- lf you don't close it,

16:50.720 --> 16:54.320
l can't establish a lockdown.
We'll be overrun by security.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.200
He removed the control crystal.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.520
Al, what are you doing?

16:59.640 --> 17:02.560
lt must link the computer
to the alien systems.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.320
There we go.

17:56.520 --> 18:00.240
- What's happening?
- They're activating the hyperdrive.

18:00.360 --> 18:03.560
While we're on the ground?
ls that such a good idea?

18:03.680 --> 18:05.760
No, it's not.

18:09.840 --> 18:13.600
Unless you're deliberately
trying to create an overload.

18:14.680 --> 18:16.640
l don't understand.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.760
The hyperdrive generators
create enormous energy.

18:19.880 --> 18:25.120
lf it's not channelled into a hyperspace
window, it can cause serious problems.

18:25.240 --> 18:26.640
lt could explode?

18:26.720 --> 18:30.880
With enough force to turn the state
of Nevada into a smoking crater, yes.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.400
That's right. l wouldn't worry about it.

18:34.480 --> 18:38.080
Long as our demands are met,
it won't come to that.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.520
Major Davis

19:07.000 --> 19:11.520
- What the hell happened?
- At 0900, the X-303 was locked down.

19:11.600 --> 19:16.960
At 0920, someone inside the ship told us
that they had destabilised the hyperdrive.

19:17.080 --> 19:20.000
- They're threatening to blow it.
- l don't believe it

19:20.080 --> 19:22.320
Readings confirm an overload is building.

19:22.440 --> 19:26.320
This is supposedly the most secure
facility on the face of the planet

19:26.440 --> 19:30.240
- We think it was the camera crew.
- Did anyone do a background check?

19:30.360 --> 19:34.040
Yes. They were clean. Their cameraman
was a decorated marine in Somalia.

19:34.160 --> 19:37.440
Every member of that crew
has been at the network for over a year.

19:37.560 --> 19:40.240
- This plan has obviously been...
- What?

19:40.360 --> 19:43.680
- A transmission from the hijackers.
- Patch it through.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.200
Major Davis. Go ahead.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.880
l assume you have confirmed
the status of the hyperdrive.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.080
So you know we're not bluffing.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.360
What do you want?

19:57.480 --> 20:00.080
You're holding two prisoners
we want released;

20:00.160 --> 20:03.080
Colonel Frank Simmons
and Adrian Conrad.

20:05.360 --> 20:09.440
You have exactly three hours
to deliver them, or we blow up your ship.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.800
This is Major Carter.
Can anyone hear me?

20:43.920 --> 20:45.920
(crackling)

20:49.840 --> 20:51.760
Yes, sir.

20:51.880 --> 20:54.160
Perfectly clear, sir.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.800
We're doing everything we can.
Thank you.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.440
The Joint Chiefs
are calling an emergency meeting.

21:01.560 --> 21:06.240
Sir, l'm picking up on a signal from inside
the ship, but on a different frequency.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.480
Patch it through.

21:08.560 --> 21:11.920
Repeat, this is Major Carter.
ls anyone reading this?

21:12.880 --> 21:17.720
- Carter, it's O'Neill. What's your status?
- l'm locked in a storage room on deck 7.

21:20.800 --> 21:24.800
- What happened in there?
- lt was the TV crew. They had a zat.

21:24.880 --> 21:28.400
(Davis) The hijackers demand
the release of Simmons and Conrad.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.560
We believe this is a rogue NlD operation.

21:30.680 --> 21:34.320
Carter, is there any chance
they can get that ship off the ground?

21:34.440 --> 21:37.840
lt's not finished, sir.
lt could lose structural integrity.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.920
Will it fly?

21:40.040 --> 21:41.120
Yes, sir.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.760
The sublight control relay
is right above you on deck 8.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.960
lf you can sever the connection,
that'll ground them for sure.

21:49.080 --> 21:52.720
l found a plasma cutter, but it'll
take time to get through the trinium.

21:52.840 --> 21:56.960
We have less than three hours to deliver
the prisoners before they blow the ship.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.040
Copy that.

22:06.480 --> 22:09.600
- Al, why are you doing this?
- They're paying me.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.720
We're supposed to be friends.

22:14.720 --> 22:17.080
They're paying me a lot.

22:20.200 --> 22:24.240
You know there's only two ways
off of this ship, don't you?

22:24.760 --> 22:26.720
Handcuffs or a body bag.

22:26.840 --> 22:28.960
Who says we want to get off?

22:53.720 --> 22:58.320
Major, if l had been in charge,
none of this would have ever happened.

22:58.440 --> 23:01.960
lt seems to me, you brought me here
to figure out a way to retake the ship.

23:02.080 --> 23:05.920
They are threatening to blow up the X-303
unless their demands are met.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.120
- Yeah? What do they want?
- You.

23:09.200 --> 23:10.160
Me?

23:10.280 --> 23:14.560
They're also demanding we bring in
your former associate Adrian Conrad.

23:14.640 --> 23:18.160
l hardly think of him
as an associate. He's a Goa'uld.

23:18.240 --> 23:21.200
- You helped him escape.
- l thought it would be best

23:21.280 --> 23:24.160
if we kept him in our custody.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.280
Sure you did.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.840
The two of you made a deal, didn't you?

23:30.440 --> 23:33.280
We know what the Goa'uld wants.
He wants to escape.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.320
What we don't know
is what he offered you in return.

23:36.440 --> 23:39.200
l'm sorry, but l'm not gonna
be able to help you.

23:39.320 --> 23:43.760
Colonel, you either give me what l need,
and we make arrangements,

23:43.840 --> 23:47.280
or we make a U-turn
and l take you right back to your box.

23:49.040 --> 23:52.720
lt seems to me that you're
in a bit of a bind now, aren't you?

23:52.800 --> 23:59.360
Fortunately for you, l am willing to board
the X-303 in the interest of saving lives.

24:01.200 --> 24:05.840
Of course, l'm gonna need
a change of clothes. Something nice.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.400
The delivery's on its way.
Moving to phase two.

24:10.480 --> 24:14.160
We've got a problem. Somebody
recalibrated the ignition module.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.400
The settings we have are all wrong.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.960
Don't look at me.

24:21.080 --> 24:24.160
We need the new settings.
lf we're off by as much as 1%,

24:24.240 --> 24:26.960
the engines won't start
and the module will burn out.

24:27.080 --> 24:29.040
We'll be stuck.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.480
Give me those settings now.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.040
l don't know what you're talking about.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.880
l'm not fooling around here.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.840
What the hell are you doing?
This wasn't part of the plan.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.520
l'm improvising.

24:47.640 --> 24:50.800
l was told no one would get hurt.
That was the deal.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.520
So quit waving that gun around.

24:58.880 --> 25:01.120
Now, where were we?

25:01.720 --> 25:04.160
All right.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.840
No mistakes.

25:12.840 --> 25:15.840
Those engines don't start, both of you die.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.400
Adrian Conrad has arrived.

25:22.400 --> 25:25.760
- Did he say anything?
- He was uncharacteristically silent.

25:25.880 --> 25:28.880
- Have we heard from Major Carter?
- No, not yet.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.840
Sir, we're approaching deadline.

25:40.720 --> 25:44.080
Radio the hijackers.
We're sending in the prisoners.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.400
There. lt's done.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.640
Sublight engines are online.

26:06.720 --> 26:11.200
Even if you get this ship off the ground,
they're gonna track you wherever you go.

26:11.320 --> 26:15.200
- You're forgetting about the hyperdrive.
- lt's far from operational.

26:15.280 --> 26:19.920
- That is something l can't help you with.
- (distorted) Perhaps not.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.400
But l can.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.200
- Are we set?
- All systems are go.

26:39.280 --> 26:41.520
Then release the docking clamps.

26:53.080 --> 26:54.480
Major.

26:56.520 --> 26:59.360
- They're preparing to take off.
- Thank you.

26:59.440 --> 27:04.080
- She's running out of time.
- She may disable the ship once in orbit.

27:04.160 --> 27:08.880
Deck 7 isn't pressurised. The airlock
in that section is still under construction.

27:08.960 --> 27:12.160
By the time they reach orbit,
she'll be dead.

27:18.480 --> 27:22.640
Major Davis, this is Colonel Simmons.
We'd like to leave now.

27:22.720 --> 27:25.280
Would you be so kind
as to retract the roof?

27:30.520 --> 27:34.800
Colonel, wait a couple of minutes. We're
having problems with the hydraulics.

27:34.880 --> 27:38.880
Nice try. You have 30 seconds
or we're gonna detonate the hyperdrive.

28:02.760 --> 28:06.360
Ten, nine, eight...

28:06.480 --> 28:08.320
- seven, six...
- Powering engines.

28:10.920 --> 28:11.920
Crap.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.480
..two, one...

28:14.600 --> 28:17.040
Retract the roof.

28:25.920 --> 28:28.240
We're good to go, sir.

28:28.360 --> 28:30.480
Take us outta here.

29:48.200 --> 29:51.280
They're entering low Earth orbit.

29:51.360 --> 29:52.960
Now what?

29:53.040 --> 29:56.320
Does the ship not have a docking bay
able to receive the X-302?

29:56.400 --> 29:58.760
We don't have any ready to fly.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.200
We've got the death glider from Anubis.

30:07.120 --> 30:12.160
Their radar is incomplete. Fly through the
lower bay. They'll never see you comin'

30:18.160 --> 30:21.840
So that guy with the weird voice,
he was an alien, wasn't he?

30:21.960 --> 30:24.880
You might as well tell me.
We probably won't survive.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.960
We've been in tighter spots.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.120
Ms Donovan. l just had to come
down here and say hello.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.680
l'm a big fan of your work.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.000
Terrific.

30:40.120 --> 30:45.520
And you, sir, you must be Jonas Quinn,
our new alien friend.

30:47.360 --> 30:50.240
You're an alien too?

30:50.360 --> 30:53.680
- l don't believe this.
- Where are you taking this ship?

30:53.760 --> 30:58.480
Don't worry about that. Just sit tight.
You'll be released when everything's over.

30:58.920 --> 31:02.480
Do you really think it's wise
to be working with a Goa'uld?

31:03.560 --> 31:06.720
He's fixing the hyperdrive.
lt's in his best interest.

31:06.800 --> 31:08.960
- We'll deal with him later.
- Yeah?

31:09.920 --> 31:12.640
- What about Major Carter?
- Major Carter

31:12.760 --> 31:15.280
Major Carter should've
stayed with the group,

31:15.360 --> 31:18.960
but she wanted to play the hero
and she got herself killed.

32:12.760 --> 32:13.840
(beeping)

32:13.960 --> 32:16.560
- What is that?
- Sublight engines are offline.

32:16.680 --> 32:18.000
What does that mean?

32:18.080 --> 32:21.440
We still have full power,
but l've got no control.

32:26.120 --> 32:29.280
The circuit's been cut.
Access tube, deck 8.

32:30.520 --> 32:33.600
lt's Carter.
l want you boys to get down there.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.840
And leave me your gun.

32:39.240 --> 32:44.480
We don't have enough altitude. lf l don't
get control, our orbit's gonna decay.

32:44.560 --> 32:47.520
Bridge to engine room. Come in.

32:47.600 --> 32:50.720
- What is it?
- Are we gonna get into hyperdrive soon?

32:50.840 --> 32:53.520
l'm working on it.
The design is incredibly crude.

32:53.640 --> 32:58.640
lt amazes me that a race as backward
as yours is attempting interstellar travel.

32:58.720 --> 33:01.920
Spare me the supervillain riff.
We're on the clock here.

33:11.320 --> 33:13.280
That's enough.

33:38.160 --> 33:41.920
- Orbit's starting to decay.
- (Conrad) Engine room to bridge.

33:42.040 --> 33:44.720
The hyperdrive is operational.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.840
- Can we open a window from low orbit?
- Yes, sir.

33:48.280 --> 33:51.840
Then do it.
Use the coordinates the Goa'uld gave us.

33:58.480 --> 34:00.480
(whirring)

34:07.000 --> 34:09.199
What is that?

34:09.280 --> 34:13.520
- The hyperdrive.
- That's bad, isn't it?

34:17.679 --> 34:21.360
Sir, we're getting a report
from AF SATCOM.

34:21.480 --> 34:24.320
The X-303 just disappeared
from Earth orbit.

34:47.199 --> 34:50.719
Clear. Can you shut down the hyperdrive?

34:50.840 --> 34:54.120
The computer's been reprogrammed.
l don't have the access codes.

34:54.239 --> 34:56.239
Let's find the others.

35:01.520 --> 35:04.240
Smith, Sanderson, come in.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.360
Come in, dammit

35:07.240 --> 35:09.200
Wait here.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.920
You're finished here.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.120
(gunshots)

35:59.320 --> 36:02.120
This one is injured, but alive.

36:02.200 --> 36:03.760
Toast.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.120
Where are the hostages?

36:08.320 --> 36:11.760
Supply room, deck 4.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.360
Supply room.

36:18.040 --> 36:21.280
- Carter, keep an eye on the bridge.
- Simmons...

36:22.320 --> 36:24.320
Yeah, l know.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.120
(distorted) l'm gonna savour this moment.

38:20.680 --> 38:24.960
- Where's the rest of my team?
- Just never you mind about your team.

38:25.080 --> 38:27.040
Sir, l have no idea where we are.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.280
- There should be a planet here.
- What planet?

38:34.080 --> 38:37.520
Back when Colonel Maybourne
was running our off-world op,

38:37.640 --> 38:40.720
we found a tablet
written in the language of the Ancients.

38:40.800 --> 38:46.560
lt described a large cache of weapons and
technology hidden in a secret location.

38:46.640 --> 38:49.440
Colonel Simmons wanted it bad.

38:49.560 --> 38:52.160
But we couldn't translate the coordinates.

38:52.280 --> 38:55.640
Therefore, Colonel Simmons
enlisted the aid of the Goa'uld.

38:55.720 --> 39:00.640
After that, it was just a matter of waiting
until we could get transportation.

39:00.760 --> 39:02.800
OK. Let's go home.

39:02.920 --> 39:06.080
lt's possible,
when the hyperdrive was brought online,

39:06.160 --> 39:10.160
no one fully accounted for
the instability of the naquadria.

39:10.280 --> 39:11.360
Who does?

39:11.480 --> 39:16.560
What l'm saying is, lf l don't know where
we are, l can't plot a course for home.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.240
So what do we do now?

39:39.600 --> 39:43.200
Gibson and Finney are checking
the food supply. lt doesn't look good.

39:43.280 --> 39:48.640
Based on our time spent in hyperspace,
we're at least 1200 light years from Earth.

39:50.280 --> 39:52.240
How does that help us?

39:53.440 --> 39:55.520
lt doesn't.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.600
Colonel.

40:04.960 --> 40:06.800
lt's the Asgard.

40:12.480 --> 40:15.600
Thor, buddy Nice timing.

40:16.040 --> 40:18.320
lt has been some time, O'Neill.

40:18.880 --> 40:23.360
l owe you all a debt of gratitude
for rescuing me from my Goa'uld captors.

40:23.480 --> 40:25.640
Nah.

40:25.720 --> 40:28.360
Hey, l thought you were
going for the new body.

40:28.480 --> 40:30.240
l did.

40:32.880 --> 40:34.880
lt's nice.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.360
So how did you find us?

40:37.480 --> 40:41.760
The Asgard monitor all hyperspace
activity in the vicinity of Earth.

40:41.880 --> 40:44.440
We have been tracking you
since you left orbit.

40:44.520 --> 40:50.240
- Excellent. Can you help us out here?
- ln fact, it is we who need your help.

40:50.360 --> 40:55.200
The Asgard home world
has been overrun by the replicators.

40:59.960 --> 41:03.720
We have need of both you and your ship.
