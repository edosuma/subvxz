02:47.247 --> 02:49.524
I'm gonna have to ask you
to switch that off for now.

02:49.527 --> 02:50.767
Okay, thanks.

03:05.727 --> 03:09.884
You know what it's kinda like?
It's kinda like a rollercoaster.

03:09.887 --> 03:13.204
You know what I mean?
It's like a roller coaster.

03:15.607 --> 03:17.727
Try it, try it with me.

03:47.167 --> 03:48.767
How tall... How tall is the Eye?

03:54.527 --> 03:56.607
How tall... How tall is Big Ben?

04:23.447 --> 04:24.607
* <i>All right</i> *

04:28.224 --> 04:31.461
Since then, I've been working
as a technology correspondent

04:31.464 --> 04:33.421
for about two years now. It's been great.

04:33.424 --> 04:37.061
Cool, that's awesome. So you do, like,
TV reports and, like, you're like...

04:37.064 --> 04:39.341
- No, just the website.
- Oh, just the website?

04:39.344 --> 04:42.981
I mean, there's some video stuff,
but tech industry pieces mainly.

04:42.984 --> 04:45.221
Cool, tech. Tech's awesome. Tech's...

04:45.224 --> 04:47.421
So where have you been so far?

04:47.424 --> 04:50.261
Travelling around the
map like Indiana Jones?

04:50.264 --> 04:51.701
- Yeah.
- Where the adventure line

04:51.704 --> 04:53.861
goes zigzagging all over the place.

04:53.864 --> 04:57.141
Yeah, actually, I'm almost done. Uh...

04:57.144 --> 05:00.941
But I started off, flew into
Sydney, went to Thailand.

05:00.944 --> 05:03.781
- Oh, jealous.
- India. Yeah.

05:03.784 --> 05:05.461
Did Rome, went to Rome.

05:05.464 --> 05:08.341
- Did the whole Europe vacation.
- Even I haven't done that.

05:08.344 --> 05:09.581
- Oh, really?
- Mm.

05:09.584 --> 05:12.981
It was awesome. I went
to Pamplona in Spain.

05:12.984 --> 05:15.341
- Is that where they do the bull runs?
- Ran with the bulls.

05:15.344 --> 05:17.261
- You ran with the bulls?
- I ran with the bulls.

05:17.264 --> 05:19.061
- That's how I got this.
- Look at that!

05:19.064 --> 05:20.461
You really are Indiana Jones.

05:20.464 --> 05:22.581
Have you got your whip
in your bag and your hat?

05:22.584 --> 05:25.061
I saved the world from the Nazis.
That was pretty cool.

05:25.064 --> 05:28.941
I, you know, just... trying to do,
you know, shit I've never done before.

05:28.944 --> 05:32.384
Is that what you're doing on this trip?
You're, like, finding yourself?

05:33.464 --> 05:37.184
Yeah, um... in a way.
I mean, I...

05:38.424 --> 05:41.581
Really to get away from the
family home is what I'm doing.

05:41.584 --> 05:42.861
Oh.

05:42.864 --> 05:46.821
Yeah, that was...
Whatever, that's boring.

05:46.824 --> 05:49.301
Yeah, well, I'm afraid
Britain's pretty tame

05:49.304 --> 05:51.581
as far as daredevil opportunities go.

05:51.584 --> 05:54.581
Yeah? It's alright, it's the last
leg of the trip anyway so...

05:54.584 --> 05:58.181
I'm... unfortunately home next week.

05:58.184 --> 05:59.781
- Not much time...
- Next week?

05:59.784 --> 06:02.544
- Yeah.
- That's not very long.

06:04.104 --> 06:06.341
- No, it's not.
- Mnh-mnh.

06:06.344 --> 06:10.824
So... I could use some
suggestions on fun shit to do.

06:12.744 --> 06:16.024
- Hmm. Fun shit to do?
- Fun shit to do.

06:26.024 --> 06:28.581
Ow! Ow!

06:28.584 --> 06:30.781
Jesus!

06:30.784 --> 06:32.221
Hello.

06:32.224 --> 06:34.264
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

06:37.704 --> 06:40.304
Oh. Another battle scar.

06:41.344 --> 06:42.981
Kind of.

06:42.984 --> 06:44.861
Let me guess, you were, like,

06:44.864 --> 06:48.664
totally shark fishing
in Cape Town, dude.

06:49.504 --> 06:51.741
Is that your
best American accent?

06:51.744 --> 06:54.981
- Yes.
- That's pretty good. No, um...

06:54.984 --> 07:00.104
It was courtesy of Josh Peters,
high school dick.

07:00.944 --> 07:03.621
He and I got into a fight in shop class.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.981
And he hit me with this,
like, metal rod thing.

07:05.984 --> 07:08.581
What an arsehole.

07:08.584 --> 07:10.341
What an arsehole.

07:10.344 --> 07:12.501
- That's terrible.
- I'm sorry.

07:12.504 --> 07:14.584
Is that you or me?

07:17.624 --> 07:19.261
Oh, it's gotta be you.

07:19.264 --> 07:21.704
"Mom." You're so American.

07:22.464 --> 07:23.781
Yes, I am.

07:23.784 --> 07:25.664
Are you not gonna get that?

07:27.104 --> 07:30.021
Okay, that was a little impersonal.

07:30.024 --> 07:32.661
What, you wanna talk to her now?

07:32.664 --> 07:35.061
- You wanna talk to my mum? I'll call back.
- Fair point.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.024
I don't think so.

07:43.824 --> 07:45.184
You hungry?

07:48.224 --> 07:54.381
Wow, look at all these games.
You're, like, a gamer. Cool.

07:54.384 --> 07:57.101
Of course I am. For my job.

07:57.104 --> 07:59.821
What, a girl never beat you
at <i>Street Fighter</i> ?

07:59.824 --> 08:04.021
Is this... Like, this is, like,
your dating manual?

08:05.744 --> 08:07.141
What? <i> The Singularity?</i>

08:07.144 --> 08:11.341
It's when computers learn to outsmart
man like women did years ago.

08:11.344 --> 08:13.901
Oh! Wow!

08:13.904 --> 08:17.701
See, what I was doing, it was like a joke.

08:17.704 --> 08:18.821
- You know?
- Really?

08:18.824 --> 08:21.341
- Yeah.
- Well, that's what you call a joke?

08:21.344 --> 08:23.381
Mm-hmm. Yeah, you guys have those.

08:23.384 --> 08:26.221
- You guys have those here, right?
- Yeah, yeah. We do at the moment.

08:26.224 --> 08:27.464
Ow!

08:29.064 --> 08:31.824
That was a good joke. That was a good joke.

08:37.024 --> 08:38.104
Enjoy your Marmite.

08:39.744 --> 08:42.821
Whoa! Oh, my...

08:42.823 --> 08:45.341
Do you guys seriously eat this shit?

08:45.344 --> 08:48.021
Okay, alright.

08:48.024 --> 08:50.381
Alright, saved by mum.

08:50.384 --> 08:53.621
The best way to actually just
stop her from calling is...

08:53.624 --> 08:55.621
I don't know, answer it.

08:55.624 --> 09:00.141
Yeah, it's kind of like a can of worms
I just don't wanna open right now, so...

09:00.144 --> 09:04.101
She's worried. You're her son.
You've been travelling,

09:04.104 --> 09:06.981
and I just think if you
speak to her, then...

09:06.984 --> 09:11.421
Yeah, well, I still live at
home with her back in Syracuse.

09:11.424 --> 09:14.184
- That's cool. That's fine.
- Yeah.

09:17.504 --> 09:19.024
I was taking care of my dad.

09:19.784 --> 09:21.544
Oh, shit. Is he...?

09:22.344 --> 09:23.861
- ...okay?
- No, he died.

09:23.864 --> 09:26.061
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
- Last year. No, it's okay.

09:26.064 --> 09:29.944
It was coming for a while.
It was early onset Alzheimer's.

09:30.584 --> 09:34.261
Oh, that must have been really...
uh... tough.

09:34.264 --> 09:36.704
Yeah, he was my best friend.

09:40.064 --> 09:44.944
Sometimes he'd just look at me
and wouldn't even know who I was.

09:48.624 --> 09:52.861
Well, my mum, like, I don't even...
I don't know how to talk to her.

09:52.864 --> 09:56.504
You know, I don't have that connection.
I don't even know where to start.

09:58.144 --> 10:03.864
So that's why I left.
That's why I went on this trip.

10:05.904 --> 10:12.301
Just to get away and make, you know,
all the memories that I can...

10:12.304 --> 10:13.664
while I can.

10:15.184 --> 10:19.704
And I know I gotta talk to her
and I gotta just...

10:20.464 --> 10:24.821
But not on this. You know,
I just... I'll deal with it.

10:24.824 --> 10:28.264
I'll deal with it when I get
back, you know. I'll just...

10:33.704 --> 10:36.344
You're a good guy, Cooper.

10:40.584 --> 10:42.104
Call your mum.

11:21.984 --> 11:25.181
Zero, zero, one, nine,
three, nine, two, nine.

11:25.184 --> 11:29.021
No, I did not buy a pair of
sandals in Koh Samui last night

11:29.024 --> 11:30.981
because I'm in...

11:30.984 --> 11:33.064
And how long does that take?

11:35.944 --> 11:38.861
Because I need to buy a
ticket back to America.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.104
Oh, my God.

11:47.144 --> 11:48.424
Mm-hmm.

12:22.584 --> 12:26.581
Can I just say, this is the most blatant
cover story for a second hook-up ever?

12:26.584 --> 12:31.341
Yes! Yes! Oh, my God.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

12:31.344 --> 12:33.621
Alright. Don't forget your bag.

12:33.624 --> 12:37.941
The bag, yep, my bag.
Alright. You are a top bird.

12:37.944 --> 12:41.224
I don't know what that means, but I heard
somebody say it once, and you're it.

12:42.304 --> 12:44.741
I got a plan.

12:44.744 --> 12:47.464
Yeah. It's odd jobs.

12:48.024 --> 12:50.541
- For who?
- For, like, it's an app.

12:50.544 --> 12:55.501
You can kind of... like, I've used it
all over when funds were low, so...

12:55.504 --> 12:57.501
- Oh, there's some interesting ones.
- Pretty cool.

12:57.504 --> 13:01.181
- "Thrillseekers wanted."
- Ooh.

13:01.184 --> 13:04.704
- This looks right up your street.
- Okay.

13:05.424 --> 13:09.224
Okay, four pound signs.
That's a biggie. That's good.

13:10.384 --> 13:11.901
It's a little out of town.

13:11.904 --> 13:17.661
And some kind of play test deal
for a company called Saitoo...

13:17.664 --> 13:19.701
Saitogoo...

13:19.704 --> 13:22.341
- SaitoGemu?
- SaitoGemu. Yeah.

13:22.344 --> 13:23.344
They're huge.

13:24.704 --> 13:26.941
- They're really big.
- Really?

13:26.944 --> 13:28.624
- Horror games?
- Uh...

13:29.384 --> 13:33.461
Have you heard of...
Oh, what's one of theirs?

13:33.464 --> 13:35.541
<i>- Harlech Shadow.</i>
- <i>Harlech Shadow?</i> Yes, I have.

13:35.544 --> 13:38.021
I used to play that in my
buddy David Ludwig's basement

13:38.024 --> 13:39.781
when we were, like, seventh grade.

13:39.784 --> 13:42.461
Well, that's Shou Saito.
It's his company.

13:42.464 --> 13:45.141
- He's like this genius, super secretive.
- Okay.

13:45.144 --> 13:47.381
And apparently, they're
working on this new project.

13:47.384 --> 13:51.261
Big money involved. Groundbreaking.
But nobody knows anything about it.

13:51.264 --> 13:57.221
Well, maybe if I play my cards right
I can get you an exclusive with Shou.

13:57.224 --> 14:00.261
Hmm? Fo Shou? Yeah?

14:02.464 --> 14:03.864
You should take a photo.

14:05.064 --> 14:09.181
Seriously, if you get a photo of
anything that they're working on,

14:09.184 --> 14:12.224
that's a fuckload more
money than four pound signs.

14:13.824 --> 14:15.104
Cool.

14:16.944 --> 14:19.664
Well, where is this place?

15:11.664 --> 15:13.624
Mr. Copper.

15:14.304 --> 15:17.621
Oh, hi. Um... Just Cooper.

15:17.624 --> 15:19.701
Mr. Cooper, I apologize.

15:19.704 --> 15:22.061
Just Cooper is fine.

15:22.064 --> 15:25.144
Then, in that case, I'm just Katie.

15:25.984 --> 15:27.901
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:27.904 --> 15:29.461
- Follow me.
- Oh, yeah.

15:29.464 --> 15:31.581
- I'll just get my pack here.
- Rav will take care of that.

15:31.584 --> 15:35.261
Oh, Rav will take care
of that. Okay, great.

15:35.264 --> 15:37.341
That's good. I don't
wanna carry it anyway.

15:37.344 --> 15:40.941
Rav kind of reminds me of
like an end-of-level boss.

15:40.944 --> 15:44.184
You know, <i>haiukon.</i> Just...

15:48.504 --> 15:51.624
- How was your journey?
- Great. Thanks.

15:52.304 --> 15:54.904
- The car pick you up okay?
- Yeah.

15:58.184 --> 15:59.104
Wow.

16:06.024 --> 16:07.784
This way.

16:11.224 --> 16:16.744
Are they... seeing? It's cool. Very cool.

16:19.624 --> 16:21.184
Wow.

16:25.104 --> 16:26.144
Come on.

16:35.024 --> 16:39.624
Feel like I'm gonna go meet Dumbledore.
Hope I get Gryffindor.

16:44.424 --> 16:48.464
I'm gonna need your phone and anything
else you might use to send and receive.

16:49.944 --> 16:52.664
- A little paranoid, don't you think?
- Can't be too careful.

16:53.584 --> 16:55.424
Okay, there you go.

16:59.664 --> 17:03.984
Wow, you really are
paranoid. Whoa!

17:05.144 --> 17:06.741
It's white.

17:06.743 --> 17:08.381
Um...

17:08.384 --> 17:13.741
Okay, so I'm guessing this says, like,
I agree to have my kidneys harvested?

17:13.743 --> 17:16.421
Actually, it's a pretty
standard NDA-disclaimer thing.

17:16.424 --> 17:17.701
Okay.

17:17.704 --> 17:21.023
It's important that you realize there
is a small medical procedure involved.

17:22.904 --> 17:24.141
Sorry, for a game?

17:24.144 --> 17:26.741
Nothing permanent and we
don't harvest your kidneys,

17:26.743 --> 17:28.221
- I promise.
- Okay.

17:28.223 --> 17:30.261
It's no more invasive than
having your ears pierced.

17:30.264 --> 17:32.897
"Confidential information,
brain downloads

17:32.922 --> 17:35.101
the game, duration, termination..."

17:35.104 --> 17:39.061
Um... The signature page...

17:39.064 --> 17:40.821
- Where do I sign?
- Oh.

17:40.824 --> 17:43.541
- Signature. Yeah.
- There's a page missing.

17:43.544 --> 17:45.541
- Okay.
- Just a moment.

17:45.544 --> 17:50.141
Alright. I'll just wait... here.

18:00.184 --> 18:01.461
What the fuck?

18:10.944 --> 18:12.661
- All good?
- All good.

18:12.664 --> 18:17.624
What we're working on is an
interactive augmented reality system.

18:18.824 --> 18:22.141
- Like VR?
- More like layers on top of reality.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.344
Oh.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.901
Okay. Um...

18:26.904 --> 18:28.464
Ow.

18:30.584 --> 18:32.421
Um...

18:32.424 --> 18:36.344
- What's that?
- We call this a mushroom.

18:39.224 --> 18:42.741
- Like <i>Mario Brothers</i> ?
- If you like.

18:42.744 --> 18:47.701
- You're qualified to do this, right?
- I haven't killed anyone yet.

18:47.704 --> 18:48.944
May I?

18:50.224 --> 18:51.584
Yeah.

18:55.744 --> 18:56.824
All done.

18:59.024 --> 19:01.544
- That was it?
- See, I told you I'm good.

19:08.064 --> 19:11.464
- No, don't worry, it's not permanent.
- Um...

19:12.944 --> 19:17.221
Okay. What is this, like, some kind
of memory test or something like that?

19:17.224 --> 19:19.821
- You'll find out.
- Oh, okay.

19:19.824 --> 19:23.184
You might feel a slight
twinge as it initializes.

19:24.424 --> 19:26.424
Oh, okay.

19:27.504 --> 19:30.104
Commencing at 5:38.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.304
- You ready?
- Yes, sir!

19:48.024 --> 19:50.141
Nearly there.

19:52.944 --> 19:54.384
I thought I turned that off.

20:01.744 --> 20:05.141
- All done. You feel okay?
- Uh-huh.

20:05.144 --> 20:06.264
Feel great.

20:08.064 --> 20:10.504
- Watch the targets.
- Okay.

20:19.024 --> 20:21.224
Um...

20:26.024 --> 20:27.941
Is...

20:27.944 --> 20:29.944
What do you see?

20:30.984 --> 20:33.341
Like a... um...

20:33.344 --> 20:35.624
Like a video game gopher.

20:36.624 --> 20:39.221
- Is it more detailed now?
- Yeah.

20:39.224 --> 20:41.064
Yep, yeah.

20:42.544 --> 20:44.901
- And now?
- Holy fuck!

20:44.904 --> 20:47.781
Holy shit! He... Fuck. He's right...

20:47.784 --> 20:50.341
He's right... He's right... Can I...

20:50.344 --> 20:51.901
Whoo!

20:51.904 --> 20:54.101
<i>He's not real. He's a
sort of mental projection.</i>

20:54.104 --> 20:57.384
<i>- You can see him. I can't.
- You can't?</i>

20:59.664 --> 21:03.901
Wow! Oh, okay.

21:03.904 --> 21:05.741
Give him a whack.

21:05.744 --> 21:09.781
Give him a whack? Oh. Okay, alright.

21:16.744 --> 21:19.461
Okay! Alright, so just like whack-a-mole.

21:19.464 --> 21:21.464
- Mm-hmm.
- I've played it a million times. Okay.

21:22.504 --> 21:24.301
Alright.

21:24.304 --> 21:27.101
Here we go. Come on up.

21:28.544 --> 21:30.941
Oh! Where you coming up?

21:32.824 --> 21:34.341
No. No.

21:34.344 --> 21:35.781
No.

21:39.824 --> 21:41.021
Oh!

21:44.184 --> 21:45.261
Oh!

21:45.264 --> 21:47.464
Alright. Stay down.

21:48.064 --> 21:51.101
Oh! Okay.

21:51.104 --> 21:55.461
Good game. Very good game.
You are so adorable.

21:55.464 --> 21:58.381
Okay, bye. Bye.

21:58.384 --> 22:00.341
- Is that it?
- Afraid so.

22:00.344 --> 22:01.501
Oh.

22:01.504 --> 22:03.701
Now, were the gophers
two-dimensional or three?

22:03.704 --> 22:08.304
Three. No, no, no.
3D, super 3D. Like... Yeah.

22:09.424 --> 22:12.781
- Now this is just a limited test demo.
- That was a demo?

22:12.784 --> 22:15.901
I think you should beta test the
full experience we're working on.

22:15.904 --> 22:18.741
There'd be more money in it,
of course. If you're game?

22:18.744 --> 22:22.184
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh-huh, I'm game. I'm game.

22:25.024 --> 22:28.904
- This is Shou Saito.
- Oh!

22:29.984 --> 22:33.021
- You must be our latest volunteer.
- Hi.

22:33.024 --> 22:35.301
This is really great. Hi.

22:35.304 --> 22:37.861
Hi.

22:37.864 --> 22:43.424
I just... I wanted to say that
the mole game, super fun.

22:44.384 --> 22:46.181
Super fun... fun.

22:48.424 --> 22:49.461
- Fun?
- Fun.

22:49.464 --> 22:52.181
- Fun is good.
- Yeah. Oh.

22:52.184 --> 22:54.141
- Playing games is good.
- Mm.

22:54.144 --> 22:56.941
Your heart goes faster.

22:56.944 --> 22:58.141
- You smile.
- Yeah.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.581
Yeah. Or, um... scream.

23:00.584 --> 23:03.264
Oh!

23:05.024 --> 23:08.501
I have always liked to
make the player jump.

23:08.504 --> 23:11.301
Frightened. You get scared, you jump.

23:11.304 --> 23:13.501
- Afterwards, you feel good.
- Yeah.

23:13.504 --> 23:14.624
You glow.

23:16.264 --> 23:17.544
Why?

23:18.464 --> 23:20.224
Oh, um...

23:22.184 --> 23:24.741
Because of the adrenaline rush.

23:24.744 --> 23:25.901
- Yes.
- Yeah.

23:25.904 --> 23:30.144
But mostly because you are still alive.

23:31.104 --> 23:34.941
You have faced your greatest
fears in a safe environment.

23:34.944 --> 23:39.221
It is a release of fear.
It liberates you.

23:39.224 --> 23:42.224
Yeah. I mean, totally.

23:43.544 --> 23:45.021
What we are working on now

23:45.024 --> 23:48.701
is the most personal survival
horror game in history.

23:48.704 --> 23:51.301
Cool.

23:51.304 --> 23:54.861
One that works out how to scare
you by using your own mind.

23:54.864 --> 23:59.301
Whoa. That... That sounds crazy.

23:59.304 --> 24:01.261
Can't wait!

24:01.264 --> 24:04.141
I'm uploading a neural net package.

24:04.144 --> 24:06.941
Neural net packing, neural net. Hmm.

24:06.944 --> 24:08.984
Name could use a little work, I think.
It's all 90s.

24:09.464 --> 24:11.261
I'm just kidding, it's a good name.

24:11.264 --> 24:14.261
It's state of the art
intelligence software.

24:14.264 --> 24:18.381
It learns and adapts on the fly.
It'll monitor your brain activity

24:18.384 --> 24:20.421
and try and work out
how best to frighten you

24:20.424 --> 24:22.901
and then adjust to your
experience accordingly.

24:22.904 --> 24:23.781
Whoa!

24:23.784 --> 24:25.381
- Are you ready?
- Oh, yeah.

24:25.384 --> 24:28.544
- Beam me up. Here we go, lock and load.
- Eyes closed.

24:29.824 --> 24:33.024
- Time is currently 6:17 p.m.
- Okay.

24:33.784 --> 24:40.104
It's uploading. Five, four,
three, two, one.

24:55.144 --> 24:56.664
How are you feeling?

24:59.824 --> 25:01.224
Um...

25:03.384 --> 25:05.581
I feel good. I feel normal.

25:05.584 --> 25:08.104
Okay. Stand up, slowly.

25:18.304 --> 25:19.624
Are you ready to play?

25:33.384 --> 25:35.821
Isn't this the
<i>Harlech Shadow</i> house?

25:35.824 --> 25:37.261
It's part of the estate.

25:37.264 --> 25:40.861
The gamekeeper's lodge, actually.
But, yeah, this was the model.

25:40.864 --> 25:44.384
The layout was replicated for
the game and the texture scanned.

25:45.264 --> 25:47.221
Wow!

25:47.224 --> 25:49.224
Very, very cool.

25:58.344 --> 26:00.901
So what's the game, what do I do?

26:00.904 --> 26:03.981
You don't have to do anything.

26:03.984 --> 26:06.581
You just stay in here alone,

26:06.584 --> 26:09.341
see how long you last until
you're too scared to continue.

26:09.344 --> 26:11.624
So all I have to do is,
like, stay here?

26:12.184 --> 26:13.981
And I get paid for that?

26:13.984 --> 26:16.701
I'll be back in the control room, watching.

26:16.704 --> 26:21.261
There are cameras all over,
so no stealing the silverware.

26:21.264 --> 26:23.864
And now there's this.

26:26.184 --> 26:29.101
- And what's this?
- It's an earpiece.

26:29.104 --> 26:30.341
Oh!

26:30.344 --> 26:33.101
Yeah, just pop it in, and you and I
will be in contact the whole time.

26:33.104 --> 26:34.461
Oh, cool.

26:34.464 --> 26:38.581
And I can, like, talk to you,
and you'll hear it? Great, that's great.

26:38.584 --> 26:40.821
Now, nothing you'll see
can physically harm you.

26:40.824 --> 26:43.341
It's all just audio-visual,
like the gopher game.

26:43.344 --> 26:44.421
Oh, okay.

26:44.424 --> 26:47.581
But if it does get too intense,
we can pull you out at any time

26:47.584 --> 26:49.821
- and stop the experiment.
- Okay.

26:49.824 --> 26:51.661
Is there a safe word you can think of?

26:51.664 --> 26:54.101
Something easy to remember in distress?

26:54.104 --> 26:56.304
How about the word "stop"?

26:57.224 --> 27:00.621
- Good choice. "Stop" it is.
- Yeah.

27:00.624 --> 27:02.621
Okay, we'll leave you
to enjoy your evening.

27:02.624 --> 27:04.901
- Alright.
- You'll hear from me in a moment.

27:04.904 --> 27:06.461
Just make yourself at home.

27:06.464 --> 27:10.464
Okay, all right.
Well, take her easy.

27:28.944 --> 27:32.224
<i>Harlech... Shadow.</i>

27:53.304 --> 27:57.184
Is this real? Yeah, it's real.
That's real. It's really dead.

28:02.024 --> 28:04.221
- <i>Cooper.</i>
- Oh, hey.

28:04.224 --> 28:05.944
<i>- Are you hearing me?</i>
- Loud and clear.

28:07.144 --> 28:08.221
Oh!

28:08.224 --> 28:10.904
<i>Reaching for the Dutch
courage already, I see.</i>

28:14.944 --> 28:19.301
<i>- I'm afraid that wine's non-alcoholic.</i>
- Lame.

28:19.304 --> 28:24.344
<i>- Well, we need you with a clear head.</i>
- Okay. Fair point. Fair point.

28:26.864 --> 28:29.464
This is high-quality craftsmanship.
This is nice.

28:30.464 --> 28:32.944
Yeah. It's good woodwork.

28:39.744 --> 28:43.184
- That's this place.
<i>- Full marks for observation.</i>

28:44.104 --> 28:45.944
Mm-hmm! Yep!

29:25.384 --> 29:28.384
Alright, there we go.

29:33.544 --> 29:34.984
Ah!

29:38.704 --> 29:40.901
- Oh, shit.
<i>- What's up?</i>

29:40.904 --> 29:42.501
I just forgot I don't have my phone.

29:42.504 --> 29:45.304
I keep going for it,
I forget it's not in my pocket.

29:47.464 --> 29:51.541
And there's, uh... no TV here, so...

29:51.544 --> 29:56.661
<i>Welcome to the 19th century.
No TV, no Internet, no wi-fi.</i>

29:56.664 --> 30:00.221
Yeah. No wonder people were seeing shit.

30:00.224 --> 30:02.421
Probably were just bored
out of their gourds.

30:02.424 --> 30:04.981
<i>Well, that's the leading
theory about ghost sightings.</i>

30:04.984 --> 30:07.181
<i>The mind plays tricks
when less stimulated.</i>

30:07.184 --> 30:09.461
<i>Fewer distractions,
people saw more ghosts.</i>

30:09.464 --> 30:12.141
Isn't that a nice piece of info?

30:14.104 --> 30:15.984
Well, they got literature, though.

30:17.544 --> 30:19.024
That's pretty sweet, right?

30:21.184 --> 30:25.701
Oh, my God, I can't remember the
actual last time that I read a book.

30:25.704 --> 30:28.261
<i>To think people used
to do this on purpose.</i>

30:28.264 --> 30:31.141
I know. Crazy. Why?

30:31.144 --> 30:34.061
<i>- You know, I don't think I've...</i>
- Shh, alright?

30:34.064 --> 30:37.141
I need to get into some old-school
shit here. Concentrate.

30:37.144 --> 30:39.704
<i>Pardon me.</i>

30:46.784 --> 30:49.941
<i>Can I point out your heart
rate just increased?</i>

30:49.944 --> 30:54.581
Yeah. Well, it should have cos
there's a huge crazy spider.

30:54.584 --> 30:56.141
<i>You see a spider?</i>

30:56.144 --> 30:58.824
<i>- You don't... you don't see that?</i>
- No.

30:59.784 --> 31:03.584
Don't... Don't walk. Don't...

31:11.224 --> 31:13.301
Holy shit!

31:13.304 --> 31:15.621
<i>Tough guy like you, scared of spiders.</i>

31:15.624 --> 31:17.141
Yeah, I'm just not fond of them.

31:17.144 --> 31:19.621
<i>It's worked out you're
an arachnophobe quickly.</i>

31:19.624 --> 31:21.664
<i>It's probing for weak spots.</i>

31:22.464 --> 31:23.664
God damn it.

31:25.744 --> 31:26.824
Fucker!

31:29.584 --> 31:32.144
Yeah!

31:35.704 --> 31:36.864
Um...

31:37.584 --> 31:38.981
Okay.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.781
Yeah, well, yeah.

31:40.784 --> 31:44.384
Whole lot more realistic
than the gopher game.

31:45.584 --> 31:47.024
It's good. It's good graphics.

31:48.064 --> 31:51.024
It's good, uh... Yeah.

31:55.024 --> 31:57.584
Weak sauce.

32:19.864 --> 32:22.581
<i>- What is it?</i>
- Just...

32:22.584 --> 32:24.304
Nothing. Nothing.

32:25.344 --> 32:29.184
Here with the figures.
There's a... No. There's a light on...

32:29.744 --> 32:31.341
now, in the...

32:31.344 --> 32:35.901
Can you... zoom in and... Zoom in on it?

32:35.904 --> 32:38.301
And you can see what
I'm talking about. Whoa!

32:38.304 --> 32:40.261
- <i>Cooper...</i>
- And now there's... Shh!

32:40.264 --> 32:45.624
There's a guy in the window.
That wasn't...

32:47.584 --> 32:50.464
Yeah.

32:52.224 --> 32:55.104
And now he's gone.
Now nobody's in the window.

32:56.584 --> 33:00.304
Which is the...

33:02.544 --> 33:05.021
Mm-hmm.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.861
Yeah, there's a...

33:10.824 --> 33:12.144
Just leaky pipes.

33:21.704 --> 33:26.119
I knew it. It was leaky pipes, like...

33:26.144 --> 33:29.101
Holy fuck!

33:31.504 --> 33:33.181
Fuck!

33:35.424 --> 33:38.381
Oh! Oh!

33:38.384 --> 33:41.184
Okay.

33:41.864 --> 33:44.024
That got me. You got me.

33:44.984 --> 33:46.421
<i>What are you seeing?</i>

33:46.424 --> 33:50.021
Like a creepy fucking guy.

33:50.024 --> 33:51.904
Wow, just...

33:55.064 --> 33:57.864
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

33:59.664 --> 34:02.061
He kinda looks like Josh Peters.

34:02.064 --> 34:04.421
- It's Josh Peters! You're Josh Peters!
<i>- Sorry?</i>

34:04.424 --> 34:07.981
You're Josh Peters from high school!
From a guy I know at high school.

34:07.984 --> 34:11.420
<i>The system could be mining some of
your personal memories for texture.</i>

34:11.424 --> 34:13.981
<i>Was Josh Peters someone
you were scared of?</i>

34:13.984 --> 34:15.621
He was a bully. I wasn't scared.

34:15.623 --> 34:17.664
I wasn't scared of him,
but he was a bully and...

34:18.744 --> 34:24.181
Man! Take a couple of Krav
Maga classes and I'd be ready.

34:24.184 --> 34:27.181
I'd be ready!

34:31.504 --> 34:36.464
<i>Kali ma!</i> Dah!

34:36.944 --> 34:39.504
I'm gonna get some wine. Re-up.

34:40.464 --> 34:44.143
I'd offer you some, but I don't
think you can drink it so...

34:44.824 --> 34:46.904
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

34:48.063 --> 34:49.944
Catch ya later, Peters.

34:52.904 --> 34:55.341
This non-alcoholic wine is pretty good.

34:55.344 --> 34:59.264
I'm not like a expert or anything,
but it's kinda great.

35:01.184 --> 35:05.461
I was in France.
I stayed at this, like, vineyard,

35:05.464 --> 35:10.061
and they had this wine, like,
grape-stomping festival.

35:10.064 --> 35:12.821
Now that, that wine was good. I know that.

35:12.824 --> 35:14.821
<i>You're being discursive.</i>

35:14.824 --> 35:17.941
- What is discursive? Discursive?
<i>- Talkative.</i>

35:17.944 --> 35:20.501
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- Rambling.</i>

35:20.504 --> 35:22.941
Is that a problem?

35:22.944 --> 35:25.701
<i>People sometimes talk
more when they're afraid.</i>

35:25.704 --> 35:27.981
<i>Helps compensate for the fear.</i>

35:27.984 --> 35:29.621
<i>- Masks it, too.</i>
- Oh, yeah?

35:29.624 --> 35:32.701
<i>Similar to when you've got
the TV on late at night.</i>

35:32.704 --> 35:34.864
<i>The voices make you feel less alone.</i>

35:37.104 --> 35:39.741
<i>Even though you are alone.</i>

35:39.744 --> 35:43.944
You aren't scaring me, Katie.

35:44.384 --> 35:46.101
<i>Pity.</i>

35:46.104 --> 35:48.981
Is there like a refrigerator here?

35:48.984 --> 35:51.661
<i>There's some snacks in the cupboard.</i>

35:51.664 --> 35:55.704
Alrighty. Eenie meenie, miney...

35:56.824 --> 35:58.544
Mo! Alright.

35:59.384 --> 36:01.104
Okay, ginger snaps.

36:02.224 --> 36:03.264
Let's see.

36:04.344 --> 36:06.824
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This'll do.

36:07.624 --> 36:10.664
Now... um...

36:12.864 --> 36:16.581
He's gonna be right behind this door
when I close it, isn't he?

36:16.584 --> 36:18.904
Yeah, that's how this works.

36:22.664 --> 36:25.541
Knew it. Jump scares get pretty old...

36:28.584 --> 36:30.061
Fuck!

36:30.064 --> 36:31.664
Oh, God.

36:32.384 --> 36:34.544
<i>- What the hell is that?</i>
- What do you see?

36:37.464 --> 36:39.304
Holy shit!

36:40.784 --> 36:44.304
A fucking... Uh...

36:44.984 --> 36:46.461
Hard to explain.

36:46.464 --> 36:51.261
It's like a huge-ass spider with a
face and dicks coming out of his mouth.

36:51.264 --> 36:52.701
It's...

36:52.704 --> 36:55.701
Peters. Peters is inside.

36:55.704 --> 37:01.304
Like a Peters-spider mash-up.

37:02.024 --> 37:05.861
Ah, Katie! Are you doing
this, or is this fucking me?

37:05.864 --> 37:10.421
<i>- I think that's all you.</i>
- I'm so fucked up!

37:10.424 --> 37:12.664
<i>God! Fuck!</i>

37:14.264 --> 37:17.301
Holy shit, you're fucking gross.

37:17.304 --> 37:20.541
Yeah...

37:20.544 --> 37:22.144
Sorry, can you say again?

37:23.864 --> 37:25.664
Katie, hello?

37:27.304 --> 37:28.584
Damn it, Katie!

37:33.024 --> 37:36.664
Whenever you come back online,
just say the word.

37:37.864 --> 37:40.941
No, I'm not scared, just... bored.

37:45.104 --> 37:46.584
That you guys?

37:52.464 --> 37:55.181
Coming to fix the earpiece?
That's probably a good idea.

37:55.184 --> 37:57.664
Yeah. Yeah.

38:09.904 --> 38:13.424
Fuck it, man!

38:19.784 --> 38:21.024
Come on!

38:22.704 --> 38:23.984
You're in danger.

38:25.384 --> 38:27.061
Sonja?

38:29.584 --> 38:32.021
Now we're talking.
Alright, this is incredible.

38:32.024 --> 38:36.341
This... very impressive.
I am thoroughly impressed.

38:36.344 --> 38:39.301
I am... Wow! Wow!

38:39.304 --> 38:43.941
You look so real.
You're, like, just like her.

38:43.944 --> 38:45.581
I mean, wow.

38:45.584 --> 38:51.501
Except... you're just
unfortunately not... um...

38:51.504 --> 38:54.301
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

38:54.304 --> 38:57.501
- Cooper, you're in danger.
- Shh! Quiet. Quiet! I need to think.

38:57.504 --> 39:01.221
You're fucking real.
You are real. You're real.

39:01.224 --> 39:03.901
- Cooper, you're in...
- You're Sonja. You're actually here.

39:03.904 --> 39:06.781
- Are you actually here right now?
- I'm real. I'm actually here.

39:06.784 --> 39:08.221
- God.
- And we have to go.

39:08.224 --> 39:10.021
- You have to listen to me.
- How are you here?

39:10.024 --> 39:11.941
You know that photo that you sent me?

39:11.944 --> 39:14.381
I dug around and apparently
Shou Saito took out a patent

39:14.384 --> 39:17.901
for a computer brain interface last year.

39:17.904 --> 39:19.981
How are you real? I don't...

39:19.984 --> 39:22.821
Okay, fuck. I don't...

39:22.824 --> 39:24.901
They brought you here!

39:24.904 --> 39:27.541
You are, you're real,
and they brought you here,

39:27.544 --> 39:31.181
and they're trying to fuck with me.
Nice try, good try.

39:31.184 --> 39:33.741
I get it. It's part of the test.

39:33.744 --> 39:38.221
His patent got rejected outright. They
said it was insane, it was dangerous.

39:38.224 --> 39:40.223
Wow. Really? How much
are they paying you?

39:40.248 --> 39:42.222
Honestly. Cos you're
killing it right now.

39:42.224 --> 39:45.181
- Have they given you something?
- Sorry, I thought you were fake.

39:45.184 --> 39:47.701
But now I know you're real,
I'm being a really terrible host.

39:47.704 --> 39:51.104
I got some non-alcoholic wine.
Might put us in the mood.

39:52.184 --> 39:55.781
- Cooper, what I want to do is...
- We'll talk about it in the kitchen.

39:55.784 --> 39:58.821
- Cooper!
- Sonja, relax, okay?

39:58.824 --> 40:01.941
Give it up. I know, the
jig's up, okay? Let it go.

40:01.944 --> 40:03.221
Look, Cooper, there's more.

40:03.224 --> 40:05.621
Five people have disappeared
in the past year.

40:05.624 --> 40:10.021
All tourists, all registered
with that stupid odd jobs app.

40:10.024 --> 40:13.021
Oh, yeah? Wow. God, that's crazy.

40:13.024 --> 40:15.781
Whatever they're doing to you,
whatever they've done to you,

40:15.784 --> 40:20.021
it's dangerous, and we really
have to go now, Cooper.

40:20.024 --> 40:23.141
Okay, okay. Alright.

40:23.144 --> 40:25.981
- Well, if your story's true...
- Cooper.

40:25.984 --> 40:28.541
- Then how'd you find me?
- What?

40:28.544 --> 40:29.824
How'd you know where I am?

40:30.704 --> 40:32.701
It's a games company,
I looked up the address.

40:32.704 --> 40:34.181
Yeah, really?

40:34.184 --> 40:37.581
No, no, no, no. How'd you
find me here? This place.

40:37.584 --> 40:39.301
- I tracked you.
- You tracked me?

40:39.304 --> 40:41.381
Yeah, with your GPS on your
phone. Find My Friends.

40:41.384 --> 40:45.141
Find My Friends? That would've
worked, but they took my phone.

40:45.144 --> 40:51.741
And it's in a building, like, a mile away.
So, yeah, nice try.

40:51.744 --> 40:54.021
That's right.

40:54.024 --> 40:57.264
So much for women outsmarting men.
Singularity <i>that!</i>

40:59.064 --> 41:00.421
Look, all I'm saying is that

41:00.424 --> 41:02.981
I think that you could've
come up with a better story,

41:02.984 --> 41:06.261
it could have been funny or...

41:06.264 --> 41:09.184
Okay, alright, don't be pissed.

41:10.024 --> 41:13.021
Do you ever wonder how your
bank account got hacked?

41:13.024 --> 41:14.941
What are you doing?

41:14.944 --> 41:18.264
- I cloned your card as you were asleep.
- Whoa. Okay.

41:18.744 --> 41:20.501
Put the knife down.
What are you going to do with that?

41:20.504 --> 41:22.941
I drew your attention to this job.

41:22.944 --> 41:26.101
Sonja, put the fucking knife
down, okay? It's not funny.

41:26.104 --> 41:28.701
Should've called your mum, Cooper.

41:28.704 --> 41:31.941
- But you called me, and I led you here...
- Sonja.

41:31.944 --> 41:33.701
- You know what?
- ...like a breadcrumb trail.

41:33.704 --> 41:39.221
Put the knife down. Drop the act.
Okay, seriously, drop the knife, Sonja.

41:39.224 --> 41:42.181
It's not fucking funny. Put the knife...

41:42.184 --> 41:45.861
This isn't what I signed up for.
I'm fucking done, okay?

41:45.864 --> 41:47.984
Fuck!

41:54.104 --> 41:55.944
What the fuck?

42:00.624 --> 42:03.701
Oh, fuck! Oh!

42:11.744 --> 42:12.864
Holy fuck!

42:21.584 --> 42:22.664
Stop!

42:39.904 --> 42:43.741
Fuck!

43:18.144 --> 43:23.064
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

43:43.944 --> 43:46.821
- <i>Cooper.</i>
- Katie!

43:46.824 --> 43:48.221
<i>- Katie!</i>
- Cooper.

43:48.224 --> 43:49.541
<i>- Katie!</i>
- Cooper, what's happening?

43:49.544 --> 43:51.701
What the fuck happened?

43:51.704 --> 43:53.781
<i>What's happening? We've been talking.
You've not been responding.</i>

43:53.784 --> 43:57.101
- You said I wouldn't feel anything!
<i>- What are you seeing? What's there?</i>

43:57.104 --> 44:00.221
- Fuck! She's gone now.
<i>- Who's gone?</i>

44:00.224 --> 44:03.061
Oh, my God, I-I felt it.

44:03.064 --> 44:05.741
There's a knife in my arm!

44:05.744 --> 44:08.741
- In my shoulder.
<i>- Cooper, who was there?</i>

44:08.744 --> 44:10.981
- Fuck... Sonja.
<i>- Who?</i>

44:10.984 --> 44:15.301
Sonja. She's this girl that I know,
that fucking... She stabbed me.

44:15.304 --> 44:18.421
- She had a fucking knife.
<i>- Nothing can harm you, Cooper.</i>

44:18.424 --> 44:22.621
- No, no, no, no. She was solid.
<i>- No, she can't have been.</i>

44:22.624 --> 44:26.101
She... I was stabbed! I would know!

44:26.104 --> 44:28.661
<i>Nothing you see can
harm or even touch you.</i>

44:28.664 --> 44:30.421
<i>It's purely audio-visual.</i>

44:30.424 --> 44:33.741
<i>- There's no physical sensation.</i>
- Fuck! Yes, there was!

44:33.744 --> 44:39.101
<i>- Cooper, you need to calm down.</i>
- I know because I felt it, okay?

44:39.104 --> 44:42.301
I felt her arm, it was warm,

44:42.304 --> 44:45.541
and I felt her fucking
stab me in the shoulder.

44:45.544 --> 44:48.821
<i>- That's not possible.</i>
- Oh, my God.

44:48.824 --> 44:52.061
<i>- It's not possible, Cooper.</i>
- Yeah, it is! Yeah, it is!

44:52.064 --> 44:55.221
<i>Physical sensations
shouldn't be possible.</i>

44:55.224 --> 44:58.101
<i>- Unless, I mean...</i>
- Oh, God. Unless what?

44:58.104 --> 45:01.141
<i>I don't know. The neuron net,
it could have maybe worked out</i>

45:01.144 --> 45:03.701
<i>some means of replicating
physical experiences,</i>

45:03.704 --> 45:06.901
<i>- but that would be unprecedented.</i>
- Jesus Christ.

45:06.904 --> 45:09.061
Okay, you know what? Stop the game.

45:09.064 --> 45:11.541
I want out. Just pull me out now.

45:11.544 --> 45:14.781
Stop, stop, stop. Safe
word. Fucking stop!

45:14.784 --> 45:17.741
<i>- Okay, okay, just let us work it out.</i>
- Oh, God.

45:17.744 --> 45:19.861
No, I want this fucking thing out now.

45:19.864 --> 45:22.341
<i>Cooper, do not attempt
to remove that yourself.</i>

45:22.344 --> 45:24.261
Removing it yourself
is extremely dangerous.

45:24.264 --> 45:26.141
Stop that, that could kill you!

45:26.144 --> 45:27.341
Just stay calm!

45:27.344 --> 45:29.461
Is that Shou?

45:29.464 --> 45:31.221
Is that Shou? What's he saying?
What's he saying?

45:31.224 --> 45:33.861
<i>Okay, Cooper. We're gonna
commence with deactivation.</i>

45:33.864 --> 45:35.621
Oh, that's great news.

45:35.624 --> 45:39.661
<i>We need you to follow instructions
and make it to the access point.</i>

45:39.664 --> 45:43.904
The access point? Great.
Where the fuck's the access point?

45:46.584 --> 45:51.621
- Oh, fuck! More stairs? Come on!
<i>- Just one more level.</i>

45:51.624 --> 45:54.744
<i>- Trust me.</i>
- Okay.

45:56.184 --> 45:57.624
<i>Left at the top.</i>

45:59.064 --> 46:01.224
- Okay, which door?
- <i>Room at the end.</i>

46:05.584 --> 46:06.904
<i>What is it?</i>

46:08.144 --> 46:11.621
There's gonna be something
behind there. I can feel it.

46:11.624 --> 46:13.701
- Something like...
<i>- Like what?</i>

46:13.704 --> 46:17.221
Some personal fucked-up shit.

46:17.224 --> 46:20.581
Like... I don't know, I could
feel it digging around in my head.

46:20.584 --> 46:22.421
<i>Cooper, get to the door.</i>

46:22.424 --> 46:26.421
It's gonna be like my mum,
I don't know, dead.

46:26.424 --> 46:29.661
<i>- Your mum?</i>
- Fucking swinging from a fucking beam.

46:29.664 --> 46:32.384
<i>- Your mother is not in there.</i>
- You're not in control of this!

46:33.264 --> 46:36.261
It's in my head. It
fucking knows. It knows.

46:36.264 --> 46:38.541
- It knows!
<i>- It knows what?</i>

46:38.544 --> 46:40.701
It knows I got this thing with my mum.

46:40.704 --> 46:43.541
<i>Cooper, I promise you,
she's not in there.</i>

46:43.544 --> 46:45.821
<i>- Now open the door.</i>
- Oh, my God.

46:45.824 --> 46:48.981
<i>It's the only way I can
get you out. Listen to me.</i>

46:48.984 --> 46:52.224
Okay, Okay. Fuck. Okay.

46:52.944 --> 46:56.141
<i>Whatever's in there cannot harm you.</i>

46:56.144 --> 46:59.101
<i>But I can't get you out unless
you open that door, Cooper.</i>

46:59.104 --> 47:00.101
Okay.

47:00.104 --> 47:02.021
<i>Would you kindly open the door?</i>

47:02.024 --> 47:04.664
Here we go. Here we go.

47:20.224 --> 47:22.784
Okay.

47:23.984 --> 47:28.981
Okay, okay, I'm in the room.
Where's the access point?

47:28.984 --> 47:30.904
<i>Access point?</i>

47:31.864 --> 47:34.981
<i>- There is no access point.</i>
- What?

47:36.224 --> 47:38.021
<i>I'm fucking with you, Cooper.</i>

47:38.024 --> 47:40.701
<i>I told you to come up here to
see if we've broken you enough</i>

47:40.704 --> 47:43.301
<i>to obey instructions without question.</i>

47:43.304 --> 47:45.861
<i>- And we have.</i>
- Oh, no, no, no.

47:45.864 --> 47:49.381
Katie, come on. Katie, come on, let me out!

47:49.384 --> 47:52.341
Katie, let me out, come on! What the fuck!

47:52.344 --> 47:55.941
Oh, what are you gonna do?
Oh, what are you doing to me?

47:55.944 --> 47:59.621
- Why are you doing this?
<i>- You thought you'd see your mother.</i>

47:59.624 --> 48:02.861
- Oh, fuck!
<i>- What does she look like?</i>

48:04.544 --> 48:06.904
<i>Your mother, can you describe her face?</i>

48:08.424 --> 48:09.784
<i>Her hair colour?</i>

48:10.464 --> 48:11.341
She...

48:11.344 --> 48:13.464
<i>Is she tall, short, fat, thin?</i>

48:15.544 --> 48:17.501
<i>- Where did you grow up?</i>
- She...

48:17.504 --> 48:21.181
<i>What's your favourite band?
Your favourite flavour ice cream?</i>

48:21.184 --> 48:23.501
<i>The name of the girl who stabbed you?</i>

48:23.504 --> 48:26.141
<i>You don't know any of
these things, do you?</i>

48:26.144 --> 48:27.661
<i>Don't you think that's odd?</i>

48:27.664 --> 48:29.981
It's fucking taking my memories!

48:29.984 --> 48:32.421
<i>Overwriting them, technically.</i>

48:32.424 --> 48:34.341
Fuck.

48:34.344 --> 48:36.184
<i>Look in the mirror behind you.</i>

48:39.944 --> 48:41.744
<i>Do you recognize yourself?</i>

48:43.744 --> 48:46.024
<i>Do you even know who you're looking at?</i>

48:48.664 --> 48:53.101
<i>Soon you won't be anything.
You'll be just like your dad.</i>

48:53.104 --> 48:54.941
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

48:54.944 --> 48:56.621
<i>- That's what really scares you, isn't it?</i>
- Stop it.

48:56.624 --> 48:59.421
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
<i>- You're going the same place he did.</i>

48:59.424 --> 49:01.141
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

49:01.144 --> 49:04.061
<i>- You're going nowhere.</i>
- Shut up! Shut up.

49:04.064 --> 49:08.501
<i> You should have called mum.
She's all that's left.</i>

49:08.504 --> 49:11.541
<i>- You abandoned her.</i>
- No, no, no, no!

49:11.544 --> 49:13.501
Get out of my head!

49:13.504 --> 49:16.061
<i>You'll never see her again.
You'll never speak to her again.</i>

49:16.064 --> 49:18.821
<i>- Never see her face.</i>
- Get out of my fucking head!

49:18.824 --> 49:23.381
Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!

49:23.384 --> 49:27.781
<i>You're a bad son. You'll never
see your mother again.</i>

49:27.784 --> 49:29.901
<i>You're going nowhere.</i>

49:29.904 --> 49:32.144
<i>Straight into oblivion.</i>

49:33.184 --> 49:35.621
<i>You deserve it.
You should have called her.</i>

49:35.624 --> 49:37.741
Get out of my fucking head!

49:40.064 --> 49:43.501
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!

49:43.504 --> 49:44.981
Get it out of my fucking head!

49:44.984 --> 49:47.661
Cooper, I'm gonna shut it off, okay?
I just need to connect.

49:47.664 --> 49:48.984
Get it out of my head!

49:49.744 --> 49:52.744
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!

49:53.584 --> 49:57.421
Oh, my God. Where am I?

50:01.584 --> 50:04.181
Who are you?

50:04.184 --> 50:06.901
I can't stop it.

50:09.464 --> 50:14.781
I don't know who I am.
So I... So I need to go home.

50:14.784 --> 50:17.664
The interface has data tendrils like roots.

50:18.864 --> 50:21.421
They've dug in deeper
than they're meant to.

50:21.424 --> 50:25.464
Threaded through your brain,
taken over whole areas, I can't stop it.

50:26.744 --> 50:28.584
I can't remove it, and I can't stop it.

50:29.624 --> 50:33.224
But I...
But I don't know who I am.

50:35.064 --> 50:38.544
I don't know... I don't know who I am.

50:41.984 --> 50:44.341
I don't know who I am.

50:44.344 --> 50:45.621
I don't know.

50:45.624 --> 50:50.424
On behalf of Saito Game Team,
I most humbly apologize.

50:52.824 --> 50:57.784
Who are you?
What have you done to me?

50:58.864 --> 51:02.224
- What have you done to me?
- Put him with the others, please.

51:03.344 --> 51:05.661
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

51:05.664 --> 51:07.981
Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop, stop, stop!

51:07.984 --> 51:11.381
Stop, stop, stop, stop! No, don't, don't!

51:11.384 --> 51:15.501
Don't! Don't!

51:15.504 --> 51:17.701
Stop! Stop!

51:19.144 --> 51:20.544
No!

51:22.744 --> 51:25.904
Oh, fuck.

51:26.784 --> 51:28.104
That was one second.

51:29.664 --> 51:34.621
Either he's super susceptible to this or
the software is way too powerful still.

51:34.624 --> 51:39.021
It's jumped from zero to
18K in five milliseconds...

51:39.024 --> 51:44.461
<i>I'm sorry. The experience was
more powerful than intended, Mr. Cooper.</i>

51:44.464 --> 51:46.504
<i>I hope you can forgive us.</i>

51:58.864 --> 52:00.941
<i>...all luggage under
the seat in front of you.</i>

52:00.944 --> 52:03.661
<i>All electronic devices should
now be turned off and stowed</i>

52:03.664 --> 52:07.424
<i>as they may interfere with the aircraft's
navigational and communication....</i>

52:31.264 --> 52:32.384
Mum?

52:55.704 --> 52:57.024
Mum?

53:09.784 --> 53:11.544
I have to call him.

53:22.504 --> 53:23.664
Mum?

53:25.464 --> 53:27.424
Why did Cooper go?

53:28.224 --> 53:31.664
- I...
- Mom, I'm right here. I'm...

53:34.664 --> 53:38.984
- I'm right here, Mum.
- I have to call Cooper.

53:41.144 --> 53:43.824
I have to call and
make sure that he's safe.

53:44.864 --> 53:48.864
I have to call him. I have to call him.
I have to call him.

53:57.384 --> 53:58.824
Mum?

54:02.424 --> 54:04.821
Mum!

54:04.824 --> 54:08.301
Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum!

55:02.344 --> 55:03.344
"Mum."

55:04.305 --> 55:10.479
