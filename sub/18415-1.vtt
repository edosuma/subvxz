01:42.847 --> 01:44.075
Take it away.

01:47.327 --> 01:51.684
Now lot 43.
Quiet. 5 millions.

01:57.647 --> 02:00.366
5 millions 500.000.
5 millions 500.000.

02:02.247 --> 02:06.763
6 mill. 500.000.
7 mill. 500.000

02:06.887 --> 02:10.562
8 mill. 500.000.
9 mill. 500.000

02:11.327 --> 02:13.682
9 mill. 500.000
10 millions.

02:14.567 --> 02:18.640
Go on ¿500.000?
¿10 mill. 500.000?

02:19.487 --> 02:22.797
11 mill. 500.000.
12 millions.

02:23.047 --> 02:24.765
A 12 millions
500.000 bet here.

02:25.727 --> 02:30.278
12 mill. 500.000.
13 millions.

02:31.487 --> 02:32.966
13 millions.
That's 13 millions now.

02:33.527 --> 02:36.246
¿13 millions?
That's 13 millions.

02:39.647 --> 02:41.683
A bet against
13 millions.

02:41.807 --> 02:42.876
13 mill. 500.000?

02:43.767 --> 02:45.598
13 mill. 500.000 pounds.

02:47.327 --> 02:50.444
13 mill. 500.000
14 millions?

02:51.247 --> 02:53.886
14 millions now!
14 millions.

02:54.647 --> 02:57.764
14 mill. 500.000?

02:58.607 --> 03:01.246
15 millions?
15 millions half?

03:03.407 --> 03:06.285
Do you go so far
on principle, Vincent?

03:09.047 --> 03:10.685
Or it's natural?

03:17.207 --> 03:21.758
I understood you wanted
to live this way when...

03:21.887 --> 03:25.596
you obeyed the Commandments
to the letter.

03:27.287 --> 03:30.484
But now you don't
want to do it...

03:31.567 --> 03:34.525
truly, Vincent,
I can't understand it.

03:37.767 --> 03:40.042
Theo, if you do something,
you must do it well?

03:40.167 --> 03:41.486
Do it well?

03:42.127 --> 03:43.276
What?

03:46.967 --> 03:48.559
I'm going to be a painter.

03:56.687 --> 03:58.086
What do you think of that?

04:02.087 --> 04:03.156
I don't like it.

04:13.407 --> 04:16.204
It's better than
that trash you sell in Gulps.

04:16.966 --> 04:20.482
Not everything is trash.
- It's trash, everything is trash!

04:20.607 --> 04:23.997
- We sell Millet,
Corot. We sell many...

04:24.127 --> 04:26.038
of the artists that
you'd admire, besides...

04:26.167 --> 04:27.361
- Oh, Millet!
That's real art.

04:27.687 --> 04:29.564
Millet is art,
Millet is authentic life.

04:29.847 --> 04:31.360
But here there's life too!

04:33.687 --> 04:35.200
And here is God!

04:35.847 --> 04:37.326
God is everywhere...

04:37.967 --> 04:42.518
but in the church
and in our damned family.

05:08.167 --> 05:12.763
The money that dad
has been sending you...

05:14.327 --> 05:16.045
wasn't his, Vincent.

05:21.007 --> 05:22.235
It was mine.

05:38.407 --> 05:41.001
Last time,
22 millions 500.000 pounds.

05:41.127 --> 05:45.325
22 millions 500.000 pounds.

05:45.487 --> 05:46.886
Sold.

05:47.207 --> 05:50.358
Yes, I think it'll be sold.
- Yes, I think so.

05:50.727 --> 05:52.240
Especially with that frame.

05:59.287 --> 06:02.597
Sir, they want to see
Mr. Theo Van Gogh.

06:03.207 --> 06:05.118
He's over there.
- I'll take care of that.

06:07.207 --> 06:08.686
Hello, I'm René Valadon.
- Andries Bonger.

06:13.887 --> 06:15.286
It's bellow the Gerard.

06:16.127 --> 06:17.480
In the top right-hand corner...

06:17.607 --> 06:19.245
go up, and have a look.

06:22.367 --> 06:23.880
Theo where are you?
- Uncle Cent, I'm here.

06:24.727 --> 06:25.876
Be careful.

06:28.607 --> 06:31.201
Well, Boussod y Valadon
know what they are doing.

06:32.727 --> 06:35.685
They have no idea.
- Things are changing...

06:35.807 --> 06:37.923
and they have no idea
about what's happening here.

06:38.127 --> 06:39.321
If you was here, we could...

06:39.447 --> 06:41.756
- No, no... it's very kind of you
to say that but.

06:41.887 --> 06:43.798
It's not possible.
Cornelia wouldn't allow it...

06:43.927 --> 06:47.317
and the doctors...
- Well, they are so...

06:47.767 --> 06:51.806
...commercial.
- Of course, art is a business...

06:51.967 --> 06:53.082
Good afternoon.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.121
I expect not to interrupt.

06:56.127 --> 06:58.118
No, Andries.
Andries Bonger, Jan Bonger's...

06:58.247 --> 07:00.044
...nephew, my uncle Cent.

07:00.207 --> 07:02.675
Bonger, I used to make
my insurance with him.

07:02.967 --> 07:05.037
Now you can made it
with me, I'm in the firm.

07:06.487 --> 07:09.320
And what brings you to Paris?
- I'm learning the...

07:09.447 --> 07:11.085
trade in the office in Paris.

07:11.207 --> 07:14.643
And you are a friend of Theo,
where are you staying?

07:15.047 --> 07:16.366
He's in my apartment.

07:16.487 --> 07:19.047
Ah! Two Dutch young men
lost in Paris.

07:19.167 --> 07:22.762
It's nothing like that, sir.
We are very serious young men.

07:22.847 --> 07:24.963
He studies the art
of business and me...

07:25.087 --> 07:26.202
the business of art.

07:27.367 --> 07:29.323
I've heard that Vincent
used to work here.

07:31.207 --> 07:33.084
Work?
He used to walk around here...

07:33.207 --> 07:35.277
laughing at the paintings
and offending the clients.

07:36.047 --> 07:39.960
What he didn't understand is
that it doesn't matter if the art...

07:40.087 --> 07:42.157
is good as long as it sells.
- You're right, sir.

07:42.647 --> 07:44.285
And I'm not sure either
that Theo understand it.

07:44.447 --> 07:46.039
What?
- Well...

07:46.807 --> 07:48.286
How is Vincent's art?

07:48.887 --> 07:50.115
He's working really hard.

07:51.327 --> 07:54.319
He paints the peasants.
He dresses, pay and paint them.

08:13.007 --> 08:14.156
Hi, Vincent, how are you?

08:15.407 --> 08:18.558
Do you know, Vincent?
The problem of being an artist...

08:18.687 --> 08:21.042
is that it takes a lot of time
learning the technique.

08:23.287 --> 08:24.766
And when you've learnt it...

08:25.087 --> 08:27.237
probably you've forgotten
what you want it for.

08:28.367 --> 08:29.925
I won't forget it.

08:31.007 --> 08:32.759
Don't turn the art in your religion.

08:34.727 --> 08:36.479
Why not?
It's better than Christianity.

08:38.687 --> 08:40.962
Why don't you go to
a real art school?

08:41.607 --> 08:43.039
I'm not interested, Mauve.

08:43.807 --> 08:47.846
I prefer to learn with you.
- Like in old days.

08:48.727 --> 08:51.799
When all artists had
apprentices, sorry.

08:52.447 --> 08:55.519
But now you live in the
country and Mauve, here...

08:55.687 --> 08:57.837
I'm going to move here.
I can't live with my family anymore.

08:58.007 --> 09:00.202
I despise them.
- I can't believe it.

09:00.967 --> 09:02.161
It's true.

09:03.727 --> 09:06.116
And my father...
I don't get on well with him.

09:07.887 --> 09:10.447
It's a hypocrisy
that I go to the church.

09:11.887 --> 09:13.002
I wonder...

09:15.727 --> 09:19.686
Well, Vincent,
I think you should marry...

09:19.807 --> 09:21.286
a rich woman.

09:23.247 --> 09:24.919
It's the only hope
for an artist.

10:11.207 --> 10:12.435
I can't understand...

10:17.887 --> 10:20.845
how he has abandoned you
being pregnant.

10:23.007 --> 10:24.565
None of my children
had a father.

10:26.847 --> 10:28.758
I thought you just had Maria.

10:32.887 --> 10:36.402
It was one before Maria
and other after her. They died.

10:37.447 --> 10:38.675
I'm sorry.

10:39.527 --> 10:42.405
It doesn't matter. It's the best
thing that could happen to them.

10:43.927 --> 10:45.246
What could I offer to them?

10:48.327 --> 10:49.680
I should go to Leyden.

10:52.767 --> 10:54.166
What is there in Leyden?

10:55.407 --> 10:56.999
The maternity hospital.

10:58.447 --> 10:59.675
The doctor told me,

11:00.407 --> 11:03.285
when I had the last one:
If you get pregnant again...

11:03.407 --> 11:04.601
come back immediately.

11:06.607 --> 11:08.518
I've got something
inside that isn't okay.

11:14.127 --> 11:16.322
I could take you to
Leyden if you want.

11:19.367 --> 11:20.686
Why would you do it?

11:22.727 --> 11:23.876
Because I want to.

11:31.087 --> 11:32.361
Al right
- Fine.

11:40.847 --> 11:42.326
Can drink something?

11:48.487 --> 11:49.476
- Yes.

11:52.607 --> 11:53.881
Have a rest.

14:10.447 --> 14:11.766
Are you painting me?

14:14.127 --> 14:15.116
Yes.

14:17.487 --> 14:18.920
You can't do that.

14:20.967 --> 14:22.082
Why?

14:22.927 --> 14:26.203
Paint me when I'm posing
not when I'm myself.

14:30.047 --> 14:32.003
I'm sorry, I'll stop.

14:43.247 --> 14:44.441
I have to go.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.121
It's raining.

14:58.527 --> 15:00.165
Why don't you stay?

15:05.687 --> 15:10.681
Why don't you stay...
and live here?

15:13.807 --> 15:15.559
There's always room for
one more at the table.

15:20.047 --> 15:21.366
And I could paint you.

15:25.887 --> 15:30.244
You must pay me for posing.
I'm a prostitute.

15:31.287 --> 15:34.199
I know...
...and I'll pay you.

15:36.407 --> 15:39.922
I've a terrible temper.
- Me too.

15:42.687 --> 15:46.157
And I want to bring Maria.
I don't want to leave her.

15:47.127 --> 15:48.526
You can bring Maria.

15:50.767 --> 15:52.120
I'll paint her too.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.806
Okay, I'm going to stay.

16:12.287 --> 16:14.596
Are you going to stay?
- Yes.

16:16.527 --> 16:17.516
I'm glad.

16:22.567 --> 16:23.795
Are you painting me yet?

16:23.927 --> 16:26.122
No, I'm painting
this pipe, the eggs...

16:26.247 --> 16:29.762
the bottle, the candle,
the bowl, the cheese.

16:30.007 --> 16:31.156
And not very well.

16:34.567 --> 16:37.957
Theo!
- Hello Andries.

16:40.527 --> 16:44.076
Who is he?
- Nobody, just a friend.

16:46.487 --> 16:49.445
Is he German too?
- He's a Dutchman.

16:50.447 --> 16:52.278
I'm a Dutchman, not a German.

16:53.607 --> 16:58.522
It doesn't matter.
- He used to live with me and...

17:02.567 --> 17:06.116
Who do you live now with?
- With nobody. I live on my own.

17:09.287 --> 17:13.040
I know somebody that
would like to live with you.

17:21.367 --> 17:22.766
What are you laughing at?

17:26.406 --> 17:28.921
I'm not laughing.
Well, I'm laughing.

17:30.327 --> 17:31.396
Tell me.

17:35.327 --> 17:37.238
I was thinking of something.
- Of what?

17:40.767 --> 17:42.917
In a painting.
- A picture?

17:44.727 --> 17:45.955
Yes, a picture.

17:47.647 --> 17:48.841
What's the matter with it?

17:50.967 --> 17:57.759
When I saw him, years ago,
it stuck in my mind.

17:59.527 --> 18:00.801
I was 17.

18:02.807 --> 18:07.642
It was a picture of
a beautiful woman...

18:08.727 --> 18:11.116
in a room, in a boudoir.

18:12.847 --> 18:18.205
Sitting in a couch,
stroking her hair.

18:21.487 --> 18:22.522
And I thought:

18:24.487 --> 18:31.598
If I could come into
the picture and close it...

18:35.327 --> 18:37.124
I'll stay there forever.

19:24.967 --> 19:26.161
It's so real.

19:30.047 --> 19:32.117
Really incredible.

19:33.247 --> 19:35.442
The ships looks like real ones.

19:37.807 --> 19:40.844
Someday you could paint
a ship like that.

19:42.007 --> 19:43.520
I don't know, I hope that.

19:43.647 --> 19:49.279
I'm sure.
He's a man like you...

19:49.407 --> 19:53.923
and he has painted all this.
- I don't know. He made it with his...

19:54.327 --> 19:55.646
wife and his friends.

19:56.567 --> 19:59.479
A woman painting?
- Yes.

20:03.327 --> 20:07.206
But, why?
You just have to go outside...

20:07.367 --> 20:08.766
and here is the real thing.

20:08.887 --> 20:10.036
That's what he made.

20:11.447 --> 20:15.804
He went outside and saw this.
This is his perception of...

20:15.927 --> 20:17.201
...reality.

20:18.767 --> 20:24.000
And he paint this and leave
it here. It'll be here while this...

20:24.127 --> 20:25.242
place lasts.

20:47.047 --> 20:50.164
She has thought it was the
beach. Well that's art.

20:53.447 --> 20:55.642
I'll take you to Paris.
If you want to piss...

20:55.767 --> 20:57.803
on the paintings,
I'll take you to Paris...

20:57.927 --> 21:00.316
where my brother works.
There there are some paintings...

21:00.447 --> 21:01.516
you can piss on.

21:02.607 --> 21:05.041
In my opinion it's a specially
good example...

21:05.167 --> 21:07.556
of his work.
You can appreciate the...

21:07.687 --> 21:09.917
Turkish and Egyptian
stiles influence.

21:15.447 --> 21:20.885
Here is a Gerome.
That you could like more.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.686
Don't look at that!

21:27.607 --> 21:31.122
My colleague Andre
will tell you about this painting.

21:32.807 --> 21:35.879
Well, gentlemen,
this is an interesting and important

21:36.007 --> 21:38.646
painting:
The fighting cocks

21:42.487 --> 21:45.797
Are you going?
- For lunch, it's something wrong?

21:45.927 --> 21:48.760
We'd like to talk to you.
- It doesn't matter, Theo, I'll wait.

21:52.687 --> 21:53.676
Sit down.

22:00.927 --> 22:05.637
We've been considering
the future of this company.

22:06.967 --> 22:08.639
We know that
you don't like to be here.

22:11.167 --> 22:15.445
It's not I don't like it,
it's just I feel that...

22:15.567 --> 22:18.764
- We don't care what you feel.

22:22.287 --> 22:26.326
You're trying to fire me.
Why don't you get to the point?

22:27.927 --> 22:30.122
Every day more galleries
are open in Montmartre.

22:31.207 --> 22:33.038
It's a different market but...

22:33.167 --> 22:36.443
- We think that any
branch should...

22:36.567 --> 22:39.479
...focus only in painting
And taking into account your...

22:39.607 --> 22:41.359
special interest in that area...

22:42.127 --> 22:43.276
It'd be an experiment.

22:45.967 --> 22:49.562
Are you saying that
I could run my own gallery?

22:50.687 --> 22:51.836
Would you be interested?

22:55.327 --> 22:58.364
I think I should think of it.

23:01.927 --> 23:03.076
I'll think of it.

23:04.687 --> 23:05.756
Good afternoon.

24:28.687 --> 24:30.086
Hello Mauve!

24:31.367 --> 24:32.436
How are you?

24:33.967 --> 24:37.039
I've been painting.
I want you to see my work.

24:38.447 --> 24:40.039
You're never at home when I go.

24:40.167 --> 24:41.919
I won't be again for you.

24:42.367 --> 24:45.006
While you are with that women
I'm not interested in your paintings.

24:48.567 --> 24:49.761
Let's go, Maria.

24:50.407 --> 24:53.205
How is your wife?
Does she know this?

24:53.527 --> 24:55.085
I see you have brought your bitch.

24:56.487 --> 24:59.126
Are you crazy?
Do you have any idea about the...

24:59.247 --> 25:03.160
- Yes, she is a prostitute.
I knew her pregnant and I love her.

25:03.687 --> 25:06.121
I thought they didn't understand you
because you wanted to be an artist.

25:06.247 --> 25:08.283
Shouldn't we care about
other?

25:08.487 --> 25:11.843
You're vicious, venomous
and you look like a worker.

25:12.167 --> 25:14.237
I'm a worker.
- Yes, I see.

25:14.447 --> 25:15.562
A painter.

25:16.287 --> 25:18.482
What do you know about painting?
You have no idea.

25:18.607 --> 25:21.644
This is revolting.
- Stop, Vincent, you're crazy.

25:27.567 --> 25:28.886
I thought you're the servant.

25:39.927 --> 25:43.078
Stay here.

26:12.887 --> 26:15.765
The baby is going to be born.
- Can you walk?

26:28.047 --> 26:30.322
Their hair is darker
than the Dutchwomen's.

26:30.447 --> 26:34.759
Their eyes more brown
and they smile much more.

26:35.367 --> 26:39.918
Listen carefully,
I'll explain it again.

26:40.047 --> 26:41.958
The reason why
we Dutchmen like...

26:42.087 --> 26:46.080
French girls is...
Don't be impatient.

26:46.687 --> 26:47.836
Theo.
- What?

26:47.967 --> 26:49.923
Are you coming tonight?
- I'm not going out.

26:50.047 --> 26:51.241
You're very boring.

26:53.327 --> 26:54.601
I don't want to go out. And you?

26:55.567 --> 26:57.876
Why does he paint this?
It's revolting.

26:59.607 --> 27:00.756
It's what he sees.

27:09.447 --> 27:13.042
Anyway...
he'll paint in oils soon.

27:20.407 --> 27:22.125
Leave him and peel potatoes.

27:37.527 --> 27:38.801
The baby is crying.

28:05.367 --> 28:06.482
He doesn't need much.

28:10.167 --> 28:11.441
Look what I have.

28:13.927 --> 28:16.680
My brother...
uncle Theo...

28:20.447 --> 28:22.483
has sent me some paints.

29:20.687 --> 29:22.325
Where have you got the money?

29:23.487 --> 29:24.556
I've earned it.

29:28.807 --> 29:31.924
How?
- What do you want me to do?

29:33.527 --> 29:35.643
Cleaning the house?
Peeling potatoes?

29:36.167 --> 29:39.921
That's very funny.
While you play with your paints.

30:08.367 --> 30:09.846
Hurry up, before
start raining.

30:11.807 --> 30:13.320
It didn't work.

30:15.287 --> 30:17.403
You're decent and I'm not.

30:18.767 --> 30:20.883
Many times I don't
know what are you talking about.

30:33.247 --> 30:34.396
Did you see the doctor?

30:38.967 --> 30:40.798
What did he said?

30:44.007 --> 30:49.035
The same as always.
Did he say it is me?

30:56.087 --> 30:58.726
He told me that I should
sleep alone for some months.

31:04.327 --> 31:05.601
Who am I going to sleep with?

31:07.527 --> 31:08.642
The door is closed!

31:08.767 --> 31:10.723
When de door is
closed, don't come in.

31:10.847 --> 31:12.599
Poussin, come here.

31:16.927 --> 31:18.997
Where are you going?
- To Saint Germain...

31:19.127 --> 31:21.880
to see the new blacks.
Everybody talks about them...

31:22.007 --> 31:24.077
Are you coming or not?
- I'm not interested.

31:24.967 --> 31:26.878
I'm going
- Then hurry up.

31:27.007 --> 31:29.840
Are you going?
- I can't sleep with you, so...

31:29.967 --> 31:33.164
I can't stay here.
Don't ask questions.

31:33.367 --> 31:37.724
You wanted to change my life.
Mind your own business.

31:37.847 --> 31:39.166
My life is fine like that.

33:32.487 --> 33:35.126
God!
I hate this place!

33:47.647 --> 33:49.558
You know it's
more complicated than that.

33:50.287 --> 33:53.324
The world of art, what we
sell in galleries...

33:54.127 --> 33:55.879
is something very difficult.

33:58.127 --> 33:59.765
I should stop painting.

34:02.687 --> 34:05.121
I can't do it if
you don't believe in me.

34:05.767 --> 34:06.882
I believe in you.

34:10.806 --> 34:12.559
But I can't force
people to buy...

34:12.687 --> 34:14.166
what they don't want.

34:17.007 --> 34:18.485
I always forget you
are a business man

34:21.806 --> 34:23.445
I'm not the owner of the gallery.

34:24.766 --> 34:27.406
I don't even run it, I work there.
They'd fire me if...

34:27.527 --> 34:30.963
I tried to exhibit
your pictures in their premises.

34:34.527 --> 34:36.358
You're generosity
is killing me.

34:42.607 --> 34:44.245
I'm going to Paris.
- What?

34:46.487 --> 34:49.797
I don't think you're ready.
- When do you think I'll be ready?

34:49.927 --> 34:53.601
Probably never!
Not yet.

34:58.127 --> 34:59.924
I want to make a deal.

35:00.087 --> 35:02.396
Every month,
when you send me the pension,

35:02.527 --> 35:04.483
I'll send you the pictures
I have painted.

35:07.087 --> 35:10.124
This way, when they ask me
if I paint for money...

35:10.287 --> 35:11.800
I could answer, yes.

35:13.287 --> 35:14.481
For God's sake!

35:17.487 --> 35:18.681
And what about me, Vincent?

37:44.247 --> 37:45.282
Come in, Andries.

37:50.087 --> 37:53.124
This is my sister
Jo, Theo Van Gogh.

37:53.527 --> 37:55.916
Hello. It's a pleasure.
- Pleased to meet you.

37:57.327 --> 37:58.476
May I have your coat?

38:05.327 --> 38:11.118
I'm sorry about that mess.
I didn't wait you so soon.

38:15.167 --> 38:17.078
Don't worry.

38:18.967 --> 38:21.959
It's new, isn't it?
I think it's Montmartre.

38:22.167 --> 38:23.236
It's a Sisley.

38:24.007 --> 38:27.158
It's not Sisley, it's Montmartre
- The painter is Sisley.

38:27.487 --> 38:28.886
The place is Montmartre.

38:29.967 --> 38:31.161
Sit down, please.

38:45.687 --> 38:47.643
Do you want something to drink?
- Yes, please.

38:54.007 --> 38:56.316
We're in Paris,
it should be champagne.

38:57.887 --> 38:59.081
But I only have wine.

39:14.527 --> 39:15.926
To Paris.

39:36.527 --> 39:38.563
So Andries...
- Yes, I used to live here...

39:38.687 --> 39:42.123
I've spent many
nights here.

39:42.287 --> 39:43.561
Beautiful pictures.

39:47.447 --> 39:48.675
All them are for sale.

39:49.807 --> 39:52.685
I'm just a dealer,
everything is for sale.

39:53.087 --> 39:55.123
Theo' uncles are
art dealers...

39:55.247 --> 39:57.363
According to them,
you can earn a lot of money.

39:57.527 --> 40:01.679
Yes, but I don't earn too
much. Almost nothing.

40:02.287 --> 40:04.278
You sell but don't paint.
- That's it.

40:04.887 --> 40:06.684
My brother is painter.
This one is his.

40:07.727 --> 40:11.037
It's ver Dutch.
- You've noticed it.

40:11.767 --> 40:13.723
We Dutchmen recognise
each other immediately.

40:28.127 --> 40:31.324
I'm going to see my old
bedroom Excuse me.

40:44.007 --> 40:46.043
Go on, please.
- No, thank you.

40:52.647 --> 40:55.719
Do you like pictures?
- Yes, a lot.

40:58.487 --> 41:00.478
Do you sell many pictures?
- Yes, quite a lot.

41:03.407 --> 41:04.920
No, not really.

41:05.727 --> 41:08.560
Well, yes and no.
I mean that...

41:10.367 --> 41:14.042
I sell many
that I don't like and

41:14.847 --> 41:17.725
I don't sell pictures
that I like very much.

41:19.927 --> 41:21.758
Do you mind repeating it?

41:24.127 --> 41:25.640
I don't think I could.

41:29.007 --> 41:30.804
Is this the first
time you are in Paris?

41:30.927 --> 41:32.201
Yes, it's the first time.

41:40.487 --> 41:42.796
Do you mind if I smoke?
- No, I don't mind.

42:18.607 --> 42:19.756
They're Turkish.

43:16.207 --> 43:21.565
What are you doing here?
Nobody returns after lunch.

43:24.167 --> 43:25.316
Emile Bernard.

43:28.047 --> 43:30.197
What's your name?
- Vincent.

43:32.687 --> 43:33.756
Vincent what?

44:23.287 --> 44:26.836
That's a Mauve.
- I knew his wife.

44:26.967 --> 44:28.525
He's my cousin.
- She's very rich.

44:28.647 --> 44:29.796
This one is a Mauve too.

44:31.087 --> 44:32.202
It's not very interesting.

44:34.327 --> 44:37.603
Be careful.
The one in the middle must be...

44:39.607 --> 44:42.997
It's a Cézanne.
This Cézanne has to be on the top.

44:46.527 --> 44:48.040
Be careful, Andries.

44:48.367 --> 44:50.642
It' has been him.
- Be more careful.

44:53.847 --> 44:55.041
This one has to be on the top.

44:59.967 --> 45:02.083
Here. Thank you.

45:18.767 --> 45:21.725
What do you think?
- I understand this one.

45:23.567 --> 45:27.640
Are you going to ask her?
- Who am I going to ask?

45:27.767 --> 45:29.280
Bonger.

45:31.007 --> 45:34.238
Joanna Bonger.
What am I going to ask Joanna?

45:34.967 --> 45:36.241
To marry you.

45:40.447 --> 45:43.200
I'm not going to ask her.
I'd like but I can't.

45:43.487 --> 45:45.318
You can't because you have syphilis.

45:46.167 --> 45:48.522
And you are the poorest
man I've ever known.

45:48.807 --> 45:50.843
And why?
Why I have no money?

45:51.687 --> 45:54.599
Because I take all
you earn.

46:02.647 --> 46:04.717
Has dad told you
how much did uncle Cent...

46:04.847 --> 46:06.997
get for Goupils?
Has he ever told you?

46:07.407 --> 46:08.965
He's the owner of half France.

46:11.447 --> 46:12.562
Yes, I should talk to him.

46:13.407 --> 46:16.524
I have all planned.
It's very sensible.

46:16.647 --> 46:18.638
Anyone would recover his
investment in two years.

46:18.767 --> 46:21.327
More than that.
There would be benefits.

46:21.447 --> 46:23.438
In three years there
would be a lot of benefits.

46:26.247 --> 46:27.521
You should go and see him.

46:30.847 --> 46:32.121
I'll talk to him.

46:34.167 --> 46:37.955
When will you come back to Paris?
- I don't have any reason to go.

46:40.327 --> 46:42.761
To visit your brother.
- My brother?

46:44.687 --> 46:46.803
Have you come to Amsterdam
to visit your uncle?

46:47.887 --> 46:48.876
Yes.

46:51.087 --> 46:54.124
And also expected
to meet you.

46:55.607 --> 46:57.438
And you've made it.
And here we are.

46:57.567 --> 46:59.762
Yes, here we are.

47:07.127 --> 47:11.279
It's so frustrating
to work for people...

47:11.407 --> 47:13.204
that are only
interested in the money.

47:13.327 --> 47:16.364
I have my tastes
and I must be my owner.

47:18.247 --> 47:19.566
For many reasons.

47:21.207 --> 47:22.606
Am I one of them?

47:27.727 --> 47:29.240
I'm 30 years old.

47:36.687 --> 47:41.238
My health is a problem
- Don't you have a good doctor?

47:46.767 --> 47:49.565
I have syphilis
- I know.

47:50.727 --> 47:51.921
My brother told me.

48:00.287 --> 48:03.006
Those are the laws.
There they are, like Newton.

48:03.127 --> 48:05.243
The theory of colours.
And the chromaticism.

48:05.407 --> 48:07.398
Anytime I come to Paris
there is another 'ism'.

48:07.527 --> 48:10.087
Impressionism
Neo impressionism...

48:10.527 --> 48:12.995
What's the name of that one?
Pointillism.

48:15.247 --> 48:20.765
You must know that painter,
he's fabulous.

48:20.887 --> 48:23.879
He uses the colour with
a scientific criterion.

48:24.007 --> 48:26.441
The art is emotional.
- I know.

48:26.567 --> 48:29.764
I don't agree with you.
Emotion is not enough.

48:33.287 --> 48:35.562
It's been probed that
colours are intensified...

48:35.687 --> 48:37.484
with its complementary.
- I've read it.

48:38.487 --> 48:40.762
We thought that we could
change the world...

48:40.887 --> 48:43.242
in two years just because
we wanted to do it.

48:43.407 --> 48:44.681
You were very young.

48:49.887 --> 48:53.038
Now I know we failed.
And we failed for not being...

48:53.167 --> 48:54.520
scientific enough.

48:56.447 --> 49:00.076
I'm not sure about that.
- I have no doubt.

49:00.567 --> 49:01.966
You get too excited.

49:18.207 --> 49:20.801
What has happened
while I was out?

49:22.007 --> 49:27.639
What's the best thing of Paris?

49:29.527 --> 49:31.836
Talking to people,
meeting people,

49:31.967 --> 49:36.199
speaking with other artist.
- You should go to bed.

49:41.207 --> 49:44.517
Don't tell me there's no
market for my work.

49:45.487 --> 49:49.196
Your job is finding it.
If you can sell Corot...

49:49.327 --> 49:50.919
you can sell me.

49:53.407 --> 49:55.967
What are you doing?
What do you do to...

49:56.087 --> 49:57.520
sell my pictures?

49:57.647 --> 50:00.161
I don't need you to
tell me what is my job.

50:01.767 --> 50:04.918
I do what I can to
sell you pictures.

50:07.487 --> 50:09.603
And I only ask you to find
a home when I come

50:10.407 --> 50:11.476
back home.

50:18.727 --> 50:21.321
And how is
the Dutch dolly?

50:29.567 --> 50:30.761
Has the servant come?

50:40.447 --> 50:43.803
I fired her.
- What?

50:44.847 --> 50:47.680
She's not coming!

50:53.207 --> 50:55.482
I needed the money
to buy paint.

51:03.127 --> 51:06.119
And I needed money
to buy this.

51:06.447 --> 51:08.677
You had to buy that.

51:09.287 --> 51:11.755
We have more than a
hundred Japanese printings.

51:18.767 --> 51:20.598
You should have
left me more money.

51:21.247 --> 51:24.159
I've been out
only ten days.

52:01.087 --> 52:02.315
What did she tell you?

52:11.647 --> 52:12.762
Did you ask her?

52:16.087 --> 52:18.043
You didn't do it.
- No!

52:23.327 --> 52:24.442
Why not?

52:27.127 --> 52:28.321
How could I do it?

52:39.287 --> 52:40.436
We will be still alone.

52:44.727 --> 52:45.955
I've got one Dutch.

52:48.767 --> 52:50.803
The same we
made ten years ago.

52:52.727 --> 52:54.319
He has understood impressionism.

52:58.207 --> 53:01.722
It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

53:04.367 --> 53:07.006
I'd like you to meet a friend.

53:08.487 --> 53:11.684
Paul Gauguin,
this is Van Gogh.

53:11.887 --> 53:14.640
Pleased to meet you.
I like your pictures.

53:17.167 --> 53:18.361
Do you know Emile Bernard?

53:19.247 --> 53:22.045
He showed me some and...
- Yes, there were other.

53:23.047 --> 53:24.605
You haven't seen
what made in Martinique.

53:24.727 --> 53:25.876
Look at this one.

53:32.767 --> 53:33.756
It's not bad.

53:37.927 --> 53:39.485
But Pisarro did it before.

53:39.927 --> 53:43.044
I love Pisarro.
- My brother has 2...

53:43.167 --> 53:45.727
- 3 pictures
- 3 Pictures in his gallery.

53:46.727 --> 53:49.002
Theo Van Gogh.
Vincent's brother.

53:49.167 --> 53:50.236
He deals whit art.

53:54.287 --> 53:55.356
I lake these.

53:56.607 --> 53:58.120
Women are so tender...

53:59.967 --> 54:01.082
and wild.

54:01.447 --> 54:02.800
I'm wild too.

54:05.127 --> 54:07.925
I hate this puritan
and missionary north.

54:10.327 --> 54:13.637
The nude, the flesh,
the sunlight. I was born for that.

54:14.847 --> 54:17.122
When I was a child in Peru.
- In Peru?

54:19.527 --> 54:21.245
I grew up in Lima.
- You haven't told that to me.

54:22.807 --> 54:24.365
My ancestors
were viceroys.

54:25.047 --> 54:26.196
Borgias of Aragón.

54:30.207 --> 54:31.356
The sun, the sun.

54:33.927 --> 54:36.316
Half of the people is
always naked.

54:36.447 --> 54:38.677
That's the reason
why the colour is so plain,

54:38.807 --> 54:40.126
dense and without transparency.

54:40.247 --> 54:42.238
The forms are
absorbed by the light.

54:44.367 --> 54:45.482
How are you?

54:49.007 --> 54:50.156
Do you feel better?

54:56.127 --> 54:57.480
He says I'll be better...

54:58.727 --> 54:59.876
in a year but...

55:01.607 --> 55:02.722
it's a year.

55:08.447 --> 55:10.199
I've sold the Pisarro.

55:14.047 --> 55:15.116
Fine.

55:21.887 --> 55:23.878
Could you sell a Gauguin?

55:26.447 --> 55:27.675
I'm trying.

55:29.887 --> 55:31.081
He's ruined.

55:36.847 --> 55:37.962
Do you know what he told me?

55:40.767 --> 55:42.837
He told me that
last winter...

55:42.967 --> 55:45.925
he had to work
cleaning toilets...

55:46.727 --> 55:50.322
in that geriatric hospital
that is in the Gare du Nord.

55:52.647 --> 55:53.841
I can imagine him.

56:10.327 --> 56:12.887
Don't believe in all Gauguin says.
- Really?

56:27.127 --> 56:29.641
I think I'll go south.
- Where?

56:31.087 --> 56:32.202
To Provence.

56:33.767 --> 56:34.916
Alone?

56:37.567 --> 56:40.479
Maybe Paul comes whit me.
- Gauguin?

56:48.207 --> 56:50.767
Would you send me
the pension, like before?

56:52.527 --> 56:53.516
Of course.

56:59.687 --> 57:02.406
Do you think you could
give something to Gauguin?

57:02.487 --> 57:03.476
No, Vincent.

57:06.567 --> 57:08.319
I can hardly
afford me to pay one.

57:11.887 --> 57:13.286
Are you saving for the wedding?

58:28.647 --> 58:30.524
Is everything alright?
- Yes.

58:32.687 --> 58:34.803
Is your husband at home?
- He isn't.

58:38.127 --> 58:39.480
You look very tired.

58:41.247 --> 58:44.080
I've tried to paint.
- Tomorrow is going to rain.

58:44.767 --> 58:48.123
I'll have to paint inside.
Would you want to pose for me?

58:50.007 --> 58:52.077
Who is going to want
a portrait mine?

59:04.607 --> 59:05.881
Can I sit down?

59:10.727 --> 59:11.842
I'm Vincent.

59:13.447 --> 59:18.567
Before I was a Dutch painter,
now I'm a French painter.

59:19.127 --> 59:21.960
Move
- Who is winning?

59:23.607 --> 59:26.246
Christ the Sower.
Christ the Sun.

59:28.007 --> 59:29.326
He sees Christ in everything.

59:30.367 --> 59:31.959
We're a very religious family.

59:36.807 --> 59:38.001
They're wonderful.

59:39.567 --> 59:44.322
For me He's the justification
of everything

59:55.527 --> 59:57.324
He says it's him in the South.

59:59.007 --> 01:00:03.922
A modest Japanese monk
adoring the eternal Buddha.

01:00:04.047 --> 01:00:06.117
Of course he looks like a Japanese.

01:00:07.047 --> 01:00:09.959
He says he's a monk.
Well, the kind of monk...

01:00:10.087 --> 01:00:11.486
that goes to the brothel
twice a week.

01:00:16.087 --> 01:00:19.397
You could go.
- I don't have money to go to Arles.

01:00:20.407 --> 01:00:24.446
It's a pity, because I know
that he'd like you to be there.

01:00:25.607 --> 01:00:27.199
He admires your work.

01:00:29.567 --> 01:00:31.842
You're the only person he
has dedicated a picture to.

01:00:37.047 --> 01:00:39.481
Our uncle
died some weeks ago.

01:00:42.847 --> 01:00:45.202
He left some money, not too much.

01:00:46.407 --> 01:00:50.082
You could take it...
and pay your ticket.

01:04:14.527 --> 01:04:15.801
Your room is upstairs.

01:04:16.367 --> 01:04:17.356
Upstairs?

01:04:19.767 --> 01:04:21.598
There are two floors.
- Two floors!

01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:24.956
What's this?
- To practising fencing...

01:04:25.367 --> 01:04:27.437
and keep fit while
I'm here.

01:04:32.047 --> 01:04:33.162
Is this.

01:04:46.607 --> 01:04:47.676
This is for me.

01:04:52.927 --> 01:04:54.155
Where is your studio?

01:05:08.807 --> 01:05:09.876
It's very...

01:05:13.847 --> 01:05:14.962
very beautiful.

01:05:17.327 --> 01:05:18.760
Where do the rats live?

01:05:21.727 --> 01:05:23.399
What kind of paint
can you buy here?

01:05:24.927 --> 01:05:28.283
The truth is that it's very bad.
Theo sends me from Paris.

01:05:29.287 --> 01:05:31.437
You're lucky of having
a brother like Theo.

01:05:32.087 --> 01:05:35.602
This is very bourgeois.
We'll use the cheaper.

01:07:18.887 --> 01:07:20.639
The yellow is a little bourgeois.

01:07:36.607 --> 01:07:39.804
What does that lady represent?
What is she doing?

01:07:40.767 --> 01:07:42.883
She's shouting for being rescued
by art critics.

01:07:44.087 --> 01:07:46.999
I'm not sure about that.
This is not art.

01:07:47.967 --> 01:07:49.241
They look like posters.

01:07:50.287 --> 01:07:53.324
Look what colours.
I've been in Buenos Aires.

01:07:53.447 --> 01:07:56.883
In South America is
happening something incredible.

01:07:57.007 --> 01:08:00.283
The pictures. They paint
in black and blue velvet.

01:08:00.407 --> 01:08:02.045
I found it fantastic.
- Wonderful.

01:08:02.847 --> 01:08:04.803
It looks like a new movement,
it'll be the future.

01:08:04.927 --> 01:08:07.805
Cockatoos, parrots, tigers...
painted in velvet.

01:08:07.927 --> 01:08:09.406
Wonderful!
- It's the new movement.

01:08:09.527 --> 01:08:10.676
Mr de Plantier!

01:08:14.087 --> 01:08:16.282
Seeing the depth of
your feelings about...

01:08:16.527 --> 01:08:19.041
that new South American
painting in velvet...

01:08:20.647 --> 01:08:23.764
I think you'd like to go to
the Bureau Maritime

01:08:23.886 --> 01:08:27.084
and to buy four return
tickets to Buenos Aires.

01:08:27.767 --> 01:08:31.077
Or better, five tickets.
And have a good day.

01:08:31.447 --> 01:08:32.720
Please, What a manners!

01:08:47.647 --> 01:08:48.761
Good night.

01:08:52.886 --> 01:08:54.115
He was the mayor.

01:09:02.367 --> 01:09:04.358
How are you? Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

01:09:04.487 --> 01:09:06.796
- He's a painter.
Oh, fine!

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:15.283
Which is the younger.
- Cathy, she's there.

01:09:17.006 --> 01:09:18.201
The one with the pink ribbon.

01:09:21.247 --> 01:09:22.760
Hello. Cathy?

01:09:31.367 --> 01:09:33.163
I'm going to read a letter to her.

01:09:35.407 --> 01:09:38.956
Thank you, Vivianne.
- Hello, Cessna.

01:09:46.767 --> 01:09:50.520
He was very rich. He was a
stockbroker and sold everything.

01:09:50.647 --> 01:09:52.683
He had pictures.
He sold everything because...

01:09:52.807 --> 01:09:54.843
he thinks that to paint
you need to be poor.

01:09:57.767 --> 01:09:58.882
I don't know why we...

01:10:01.487 --> 01:10:05.526
bother to do this.
I must be totally...

01:10:06.207 --> 01:10:08.516
impotent.
- Me too.

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:12.726
Do you want to marry me?

01:10:13.727 --> 01:10:16.036
No!
- It was just an idea.

01:10:38.327 --> 01:10:39.442
What are you doing?

01:10:43.527 --> 01:10:44.676
Cooking.

01:10:47.927 --> 01:10:50.077
Nobody can cook in
such a mess.

01:10:52.047 --> 01:10:53.241
How can you find anything?

01:10:56.607 --> 01:10:58.757
You have to do the right thing
in the right order.

01:11:02.447 --> 01:11:03.482
I'll show you.

01:11:27.967 --> 01:11:29.116
You take a tomato...

01:11:33.327 --> 01:11:34.316
peel it...

01:11:45.367 --> 01:11:46.436
cut it...

01:11:53.647 --> 01:11:54.841
take the seeds out...

01:12:01.487 --> 01:12:04.001
cut it in slices.

01:12:15.287 --> 01:12:18.359
And now some
fresh basil.

01:12:22.247 --> 01:12:23.316
Not too much.

01:12:31.807 --> 01:12:32.796
Give it to me.

01:12:39.327 --> 01:12:40.316
Thank you.

01:12:44.767 --> 01:12:45.836
Very good.

01:12:52.447 --> 01:12:55.996
And now you add
some cheese.

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:14.082
Do you see?
The colours are complementary.

01:13:23.447 --> 01:13:26.644
Now some yellow.
Your yellow.

01:13:28.687 --> 01:13:29.836
Olive oil...

01:13:33.087 --> 01:13:37.365
some salt...
and that's it.

01:13:41.607 --> 01:13:43.837
The food is ready
when you think it is.

01:13:44.927 --> 01:13:46.679
You don't need recipes.

01:13:49.287 --> 01:13:52.802
You have to use
your imagination.

01:13:54.327 --> 01:13:55.601
Cooking is like painting.

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:15.679
You don't like the way I paint.
- I don't like the way you cook.

01:15:02.087 --> 01:15:03.361
I can't think of nothing.

01:15:06.887 --> 01:15:07.956
Then practise.

01:15:13.527 --> 01:15:14.676
I'm not crazy.

01:15:17.287 --> 01:15:18.436
You drive me crazy.

01:15:31.767 --> 01:15:34.122
All artists are crazy.

01:17:38.207 --> 01:17:43.759
I'm painting
an self-portrait...

01:17:46.367 --> 01:17:49.120
with moustache of Mona Lisa.

01:18:17.607 --> 01:18:19.723
Don't you like it?
- Take him out of here...

01:18:19.847 --> 01:18:23.726
or I'll call the police.
Is that clear? Out!

01:18:24.727 --> 01:18:27.878
Sr. Holy Spirit,
let's go praying outside.

01:18:32.487 --> 01:18:35.285
Haven't you head me? Out!
- Leave him alone.

01:18:45.007 --> 01:18:49.603
If you do it again, I'll kill you.
- You'll have to kill me.

01:18:49.767 --> 01:18:53.840
Out of here, come on!
- Out of here you two!

01:20:16.247 --> 01:20:17.362
Are you alright?

01:20:27.687 --> 01:20:28.756
What has happened?

01:20:31.087 --> 01:20:35.000
You get drunk.
You wanted to kill me.

01:20:36.327 --> 01:20:39.603
I forgive you.
I'm coming back to Paris.

01:20:47.447 --> 01:20:48.516
You can't.

01:21:05.567 --> 01:21:07.285
Take this knife out of your mouth.

01:21:18.047 --> 01:21:21.244
Go out of here.
Let me sleep.

01:22:45.247 --> 01:22:46.316
Slob.

01:24:26.207 --> 01:24:27.401
I'm going to take you this off.

01:24:54.167 --> 01:24:55.395
Do you love me?
- Yes.

01:25:02.407 --> 01:25:03.396
One moment!

01:25:25.007 --> 01:25:26.201
Who is it?
- Andries.

01:25:31.167 --> 01:25:32.998
Hello, Andries.
- Hello, are you alone?

01:25:33.127 --> 01:25:36.836
- Yes. Well, no. Joanna!

01:25:36.967 --> 01:25:40.596
Joanna is here!
- Your brother has come.

01:25:40.807 --> 01:25:43.560
I went out again with Celeste,
she was in a very bad temper...

01:25:43.687 --> 01:25:45.279
I couldn't stand her.
- Sit down.

01:25:49.527 --> 01:25:52.200
Champagne!
- Do you want a drink?

01:25:52.327 --> 01:25:54.887
It looks like tonight
you had better luck than I did.

01:25:55.007 --> 01:25:57.157
Yes, I'd love a drink.

01:26:07.567 --> 01:26:09.444
Help yourself.
- Thank you.

01:26:15.207 --> 01:26:17.641
Jo, what are you doing?
- She must be washing her hands.

01:26:23.647 --> 01:26:26.036
Seat down.
- Good night.

01:26:36.127 --> 01:26:38.402
Cover yourself, it's cold.
- Really, Andries...

01:26:42.407 --> 01:26:43.726
We have something to tell you.

01:26:45.327 --> 01:26:46.476
We're going to get married.

01:26:48.287 --> 01:26:49.845
Very soon.
- After New Year.

01:26:49.967 --> 01:26:53.004
- That's wonderful.
It's about time. Don't you think?

01:26:53.447 --> 01:26:54.721
We should make a toast for that.

01:27:01.167 --> 01:27:02.600
For a long and happy life.

01:28:06.607 --> 01:28:10.156
Vincent,
it's you?

01:29:02.927 --> 01:29:03.996
Hey, bull!

01:29:43.447 --> 01:29:45.563
That's what I always say.
Good morning.

01:29:45.847 --> 01:29:48.236
Good morning. See you tomorrow.

01:29:51.247 --> 01:29:52.521
Good morning!

01:30:08.887 --> 01:30:11.037
Mr. Theo Van Gogh,
a telegram for you.

01:30:30.727 --> 01:30:31.876
I'm going to vomit.

01:30:34.607 --> 01:30:35.596
Thank you.

01:30:59.487 --> 01:31:03.639
I AM THE HOLY SPIRIT.
I AM WHOLE IN SPIRIT.

01:31:16.127 --> 01:31:18.766
The police wanted to arrest
me for murder.

01:31:24.807 --> 01:31:27.116
I'd like to know what
has been happening here.

01:31:29.487 --> 01:31:32.479
He's completely crazy.
Cutting his ear!

01:31:33.567 --> 01:31:35.398
He didn't cut
his ear, just the lobe.

01:31:39.167 --> 01:31:41.158
Give me money to
come back to Paris.

01:31:43.647 --> 01:31:45.603
You can't.
You must stay here.

01:31:46.927 --> 01:31:48.076
You must see him.

01:31:49.087 --> 01:31:50.315
He's completely crazy.

01:32:01.567 --> 01:32:02.682
This is incredible.

01:32:05.047 --> 01:32:07.003
The whole family
wants to destroy me.

01:32:46.407 --> 01:32:47.396
Your brother.

01:32:52.287 --> 01:32:53.686
Doctor, please.

01:33:31.247 --> 01:33:32.521
The food is delicious.

01:33:34.647 --> 01:33:35.796
Is it a good hospital?

01:33:38.047 --> 01:33:39.196
Yes, I think so.

01:33:42.007 --> 01:33:43.838
It's a very nice doctor.

01:33:44.687 --> 01:33:45.676
What has he said?

01:33:48.127 --> 01:33:49.276
He says he doesn't know.

01:33:52.607 --> 01:33:56.885
It could happen again.

01:33:59.127 --> 01:34:00.719
He isn't crazy, is he?
- No.

01:34:02.567 --> 01:34:03.795
He is not crazy.

01:34:09.247 --> 01:34:13.320
It's jut an illness.

01:34:15.047 --> 01:34:16.036
I understand.

01:34:24.207 --> 01:34:26.402
The doctor says
there is a place where...

01:34:28.287 --> 01:34:29.481
he can be looked after.

01:34:31.007 --> 01:34:33.919
It's in St. Remy.
It's said to be very good.

01:34:41.567 --> 01:34:42.636
My God!

01:34:50.967 --> 01:34:52.036
I'm sorry.

01:34:57.327 --> 01:34:59.397
It's an asylum.

01:35:03.927 --> 01:35:08.159
Vincent is in an asylum.

01:35:21.007 --> 01:35:22.326
Have you got hallucinations again?

01:35:25.647 --> 01:35:28.241
They were nightmares.
- What kind of nightmares?

01:35:29.887 --> 01:35:34.165
Sexual, religious.
- Do you have them more or...

01:35:34.287 --> 01:35:35.276
less frequently?

01:35:38.167 --> 01:35:39.316
Less frequently.

01:35:41.687 --> 01:35:43.405
You know you're here
as a voluntary patient.

01:35:44.127 --> 01:35:45.446
I'm alone, do you understand?

01:35:50.087 --> 01:35:55.445
I drink too much.
And I feel lonely.

01:35:56.167 --> 01:35:57.156
I'm a nuisance.

01:35:59.807 --> 01:36:01.001
They put up with me.

01:36:02.327 --> 01:36:05.683
Don't worry.
For the moment it doesn't matter.

01:36:06.967 --> 01:36:11.279
How many fits have you had?
Four in four months, yes.

01:36:12.247 --> 01:36:16.001
From now on you'll have to
be in a doctor's care.

01:36:17.567 --> 01:36:19.205
You understand that, don't you?

01:36:24.287 --> 01:36:29.315
We'll go on like until now.
There's no treatment for...

01:36:29.447 --> 01:36:33.884
your case, except resting.
And maybe the baths help you.

01:36:37.967 --> 01:36:42.085
I've given you permission to paint.
- I can't. Everybody looks at me.

01:36:46.087 --> 01:36:47.486
We'll see how you progress.

01:36:49.647 --> 01:36:52.559
In a week or two
we'll examine the situation.

01:36:53.887 --> 01:36:56.037
Trabuc, as long as he is
with you there's no problem.

01:36:56.207 --> 01:37:00.086
He can walk, paint...
do what he wants.

01:37:17.647 --> 01:37:18.762
Is it a new one?

01:37:20.847 --> 01:37:22.803
Is it a new one
or are you reading the old ones?

01:37:28.647 --> 01:37:29.762
It arrived yesterday.

01:37:29.887 --> 01:37:31.002
- The coffee.
- Thank you.

01:37:32.127 --> 01:37:33.116
What does he say?

01:37:35.727 --> 01:37:36.876
Nothing, really.

01:37:39.847 --> 01:37:40.996
Where does he get the time?

01:37:41.887 --> 01:37:44.037
What for?
- He writes a daily letter...

01:37:44.167 --> 01:37:46.283
sometimes, two.
- And how many pictures a day?

01:37:46.967 --> 01:37:48.446
Two, three, four...?

01:37:51.327 --> 01:37:53.636
He works a lot.
- Can I read it?

01:38:01.807 --> 01:38:07.564
The letters are private.
He has written it for me.

01:38:11.087 --> 01:38:13.920
They must be read
only by the person...

01:38:14.047 --> 01:38:15.082
they're addressed to.

01:38:16.687 --> 01:38:17.836
I wouldn't read yours.

01:38:20.567 --> 01:38:23.604
There's nothing in them
that could interest you.

01:38:24.087 --> 01:38:26.521
And why do you keep them?
There must be around one hundred.

01:38:27.327 --> 01:38:30.239
Because they're from my brother
and he has written it for me.

01:38:30.367 --> 01:38:32.403
But if you want to read them, read them.

01:38:35.527 --> 01:38:39.725
I don't like your moustache.
And Vincent won't like it either.

01:38:40.647 --> 01:38:44.117
Vincent?
- The baby. It's bristly, do you know?

01:39:24.247 --> 01:39:28.525
So you're going to call
that bastard Vincent.

01:39:30.287 --> 01:39:32.278
It's a foolishness.
- What?

01:39:36.407 --> 01:39:37.601
I was talking to my brother.

01:39:45.127 --> 01:39:46.242
It's ridiculous.

01:39:48.967 --> 01:39:50.764
Me, a godfather,
in these conditions.

01:39:54.727 --> 01:39:55.842
A foolishness.

01:40:00.927 --> 01:40:01.916
What?

01:40:03.127 --> 01:40:04.276
I haven't said anything.

01:40:22.367 --> 01:40:23.766
It's time to come back.

01:40:42.207 --> 01:40:44.482
How many months are you pregnant?
- Six and a half.

01:40:44.607 --> 01:40:45.926
- You have two and a half left.

01:40:47.127 --> 01:40:49.516
He's delighted. Do you want something?
- No thanks.

01:40:49.647 --> 01:40:50.875
- I'll have a glass of water.

01:40:54.487 --> 01:40:56.762
Come, I want to show you
my pictures.

01:41:02.967 --> 01:41:05.242
Do you see that man who
is with Emile Bernard?

01:41:06.127 --> 01:41:08.721
He's Doctor Paul Gachet.
- Did you tell him about Vincent?

01:41:10.287 --> 01:41:11.276
Doctor!

01:41:11.847 --> 01:41:14.919
Ah Tanguy! How are you?
- Fine. I'd like you to meet...

01:41:15.047 --> 01:41:16.036
Vincent's brother.

01:41:16.367 --> 01:41:18.801
Vincent?
- Van Gogh, I told you about him.

01:41:22.207 --> 01:41:24.846
Dr. Paul Gachet,
Vincent Van Gogh.

01:41:25.007 --> 01:41:27.441
Yes, the brother.
The famous brother.

01:41:27.687 --> 01:41:30.997
Pisarro told that they're
the bests pictures in the hall.

01:41:32.087 --> 01:41:34.999
They're very good.
Tanguy told me he is...

01:41:35.127 --> 01:41:38.881
in a sanatorium in the South.
In St. Remy, he went in voluntarily.

01:41:39.367 --> 01:41:41.927
It's depressing.
- Don't you think is good for him?

01:41:42.047 --> 01:41:43.036
Excuse me.

01:41:44.967 --> 01:41:46.036
Marguerite, please.

01:41:50.727 --> 01:41:52.877
I don't want you
to talk to artists.

01:41:53.247 --> 01:41:56.444
Then...?
- They're no good for you, don't do it.

01:41:57.087 --> 01:41:59.806
Who do you want me to talk to.
- This is my daughter Marguerite.

01:41:59.927 --> 01:42:01.679
You know Tanguy.
- Pleased to meet you.

01:42:03.207 --> 01:42:04.401
This is my wife...

01:42:05.047 --> 01:42:06.560
Dr. Gachet...
- Pleased to meet you.

01:42:07.567 --> 01:42:10.081
And his daughter Marguerite.
- Talk to Mrs Van Gogh.

01:42:13.407 --> 01:42:16.205
About your brother and the South...

01:42:16.327 --> 01:42:18.158
- Please...
- Thank you. That's his problem.

01:42:18.887 --> 01:42:21.560
The mistral drives men crazy.

01:42:22.327 --> 01:42:26.036
A man can commit a
murder during the Mistral.

01:42:27.567 --> 01:42:29.125
That's a legal defence.

01:42:29.887 --> 01:42:32.401
This is my brother Andries.
Excuse me a moment.

01:42:32.527 --> 01:42:35.200
I'll be right back.
- Hello.

01:42:36.127 --> 01:42:40.166
Take him out of there.
To the North. To Paris.

01:42:41.927 --> 01:42:43.519
He needs to paint
where healthy people paint...

01:42:43.647 --> 01:42:44.762
- Would you like to see him?

01:42:44.887 --> 01:42:48.846
Do me that favour.
- Send him to Auvers, where I live.

01:42:48.967 --> 01:42:53.643
I'll keep him some time
under observation, we'll see.

01:43:06.647 --> 01:43:08.956
What are you doing?
- Washing the floor, don't you see?

01:43:12.207 --> 01:43:13.196
Why?

01:43:22.367 --> 01:43:25.245
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.

01:43:34.927 --> 01:43:37.282
I've written to Vincent.
- What?

01:43:40.567 --> 01:43:41.556
And if...?

01:43:48.407 --> 01:43:52.036
You'd better call the doctor.
I think I'm going to give birth.

01:44:02.287 --> 01:44:06.405
The exhibition has been wonderful.
Everybody thinks that his...

01:44:06.527 --> 01:44:08.916
pictures are wonderful.
And me too.

01:44:10.087 --> 01:44:12.442
Bernard was there too.
And the critics.

01:44:12.607 --> 01:44:14.120
Who cares about the critics?

01:44:15.367 --> 01:44:16.595
Tanguy was delighted.

01:44:19.567 --> 01:44:20.636
He said nice things about you.

01:44:21.367 --> 01:44:23.198
I'd like you to meet
Mr and Mrs Ravoux...

01:44:23.327 --> 01:44:25.522
they're adorable.
It's very difficult to find...

01:44:25.647 --> 01:44:28.036
a room in Auvers.
Too many artists.

01:44:28.967 --> 01:44:32.323
Doctor Gachet.
- Mrs. Ravoux, Theo Van Gogh.

01:44:32.927 --> 01:44:35.999
I'm Vincent Van Gogh
- Yes, of course. The artist.

01:44:36.927 --> 01:44:39.157
The only one we have is
the attic room.

01:44:39.287 --> 01:44:42.006
- Artists
love attics.

01:44:43.247 --> 01:44:46.284
I see you have a new cook.
How can you know it?

01:44:46.487 --> 01:44:49.957
It must be very hard for your
daughter taking care of everything.

01:44:50.087 --> 01:44:52.317
- I want you to meet my daughter.
- Do you want to drink something?

01:44:52.447 --> 01:44:55.041
Not me.
We'll drink something at home.

01:44:56.887 --> 01:44:58.843
Do you know that seven
painters have made me a portrait?

01:44:59.287 --> 01:45:01.039
Maybe you want to do me one.

01:45:02.887 --> 01:45:05.321
Hello Hilda.
Mr Vincent Van Gogh.

01:45:06.127 --> 01:45:08.721
Is my daughter at home?
Of course she is. Come in.

01:45:10.247 --> 01:45:11.600
She'll love meeting you.

01:45:28.047 --> 01:45:30.607
My brother told me
that you have many pictures.

01:45:31.167 --> 01:45:34.398
Oh, yes!
Monet, Cessna... All them.

01:45:39.847 --> 01:45:43.317
Where are they?
- The pictures? Not here.

01:45:44.367 --> 01:45:45.641
In the safe.

01:45:52.247 --> 01:45:56.126
Did you meet Cessna?
- Yes, I remember him.

01:45:56.247 --> 01:45:58.715
- No, of course not.
You were just a child.

01:46:04.287 --> 01:46:06.357
He's a good company.
- Yes.

01:46:08.527 --> 01:46:11.997
He's a wonderful artist.
And I could help him...

01:46:12.127 --> 01:46:13.526
before he becomes famous.

01:46:14.607 --> 01:46:15.756
Helping people.

01:46:17.287 --> 01:46:18.561
That's my job.

01:46:20.247 --> 01:46:22.477
I am...
although it's bad that I say it...

01:46:23.647 --> 01:46:26.639
a philanthropist
- Yes, that's it, Mr...

01:46:27.407 --> 01:46:31.002
Mr. Van... Mr...
- Van Gogh

01:46:33.847 --> 01:46:34.836
Vincent.

01:46:37.367 --> 01:46:38.561
An identity problem.

01:46:40.447 --> 01:46:41.516
I have one too.

01:46:42.687 --> 01:46:46.441
I've never know who I am.
Gachet is a horrible name.

01:46:47.247 --> 01:46:51.604
People can't pronounce it.
Gachet, Guichet, Gaucher...

01:46:51.727 --> 01:46:53.365
cachet, cliché.

01:47:04.207 --> 01:47:06.482
I like huts.
- What?

01:47:06.687 --> 01:47:08.086
I like huts.

01:47:11.647 --> 01:47:16.118
Adam and Eve lived in one.
They should have lived in a house.

01:47:16.807 --> 01:47:20.402
And maybe then they
wouldn't have lost the Paradise.

01:47:23.807 --> 01:47:25.877
Maybe they shouldn't
have lived in a house.

01:47:26.607 --> 01:47:28.757
Maybe they should
have lived outside...

01:47:29.847 --> 01:47:32.964
sleeping out in the open,
under the stars.

01:47:33.087 --> 01:47:36.159
Nonsense, Marguerite.
People need a shelter.

01:47:37.447 --> 01:47:39.119
In the Paradise?
- Of course.

01:47:39.687 --> 01:47:41.279
God made a lot of mistakes.

01:47:43.567 --> 01:47:44.716
I like the stars.

01:47:45.727 --> 01:47:50.243
The world is a bad picture.
He should have destroyed it.

01:47:50.367 --> 01:47:53.439
The world is crazy.
Everybody knows it.

01:47:58.047 --> 01:47:59.480
Although the nature is perfect.

01:48:02.527 --> 01:48:04.199
Why bother to paint it?

01:48:06.567 --> 01:48:08.478
I can live without God,
but not without painting.

01:48:10.487 --> 01:48:14.958
It's no use telling it to her.
She can't paint.

01:48:15.807 --> 01:48:18.275
No. She can't paint.

01:50:11.567 --> 01:50:12.556
Hello, Hilda.

01:50:27.807 --> 01:50:30.924
Hens.
And some ducks.

01:50:48.527 --> 01:50:49.721
At last I could get him off to sleep.

01:50:52.167 --> 01:50:55.523
This food looks delicious.
I'm starving.

01:50:56.367 --> 01:50:58.198
Can you pass me the lamb?
- Ah, the lamb.

01:51:00.007 --> 01:51:00.996
Do you want some lamb?
- No.

01:51:01.447 --> 01:51:03.642
This is different from St. Remy,
isn't it, Vincent?

01:51:05.887 --> 01:51:07.206
How much time was he there?

01:51:09.527 --> 01:51:13.076
He was there a whole year.
Twelve months.

01:51:17.327 --> 01:51:21.286
In a couple of weeks
he's completely healed.

01:51:25.007 --> 01:51:28.682
Covered with paint...
working anytime...

01:51:31.127 --> 01:51:33.436
What do you think?
Is he an ill man?

01:51:33.847 --> 01:51:34.836
No, he isn't.

01:51:35.727 --> 01:51:36.876
It's a healthy painter.

01:51:43.247 --> 01:51:47.206
Do you think he can come to Paris?
- Of course.

01:51:47.967 --> 01:51:49.525
He can survive
everywhere.

01:51:49.647 --> 01:51:52.036
In El Cairo, Beirut, Macao...

01:51:54.927 --> 01:51:56.121
Can you put me some wine?

01:51:58.287 --> 01:51:59.515
This man is not sick.

01:52:03.047 --> 01:52:07.006
He's an artist.
We are the sick ones.

01:52:08.567 --> 01:52:09.920
The ones who are not artists.

01:52:12.207 --> 01:52:13.196
Just people.

01:52:15.807 --> 01:52:19.038
Working people,
boring people...

01:52:20.567 --> 01:52:21.682
Just people.

01:52:25.327 --> 01:52:27.921
Mr. Boussod... has it be
June our best month?

01:52:28.687 --> 01:52:31.485
Because look at this.
June has been a good month.

01:52:32.247 --> 01:52:33.839
Ah, yes.
- How do you explain it?

01:52:33.927 --> 01:52:35.155
There was an exhibition.
- Whose?

01:52:35.287 --> 01:52:36.276
- Grapelli's.

01:52:43.927 --> 01:52:46.680
You must be satisfied with
the way I run the gallery.

01:52:47.487 --> 01:52:48.761
It looks it goes fine.

01:52:50.087 --> 01:52:52.203
In that case, I'm sure
you won't mind...

01:52:53.687 --> 01:52:55.757
that I remind you
that I'm a married man...

01:52:56.727 --> 01:52:57.876
and that I have a son.

01:52:58.807 --> 01:53:00.923
My expenses have
increased a lot.

01:53:08.287 --> 01:53:11.404
My salary hasn't increased
since I came here.

01:53:12.167 --> 01:53:15.364
You have your commission.
- Yes, of course.

01:53:16.127 --> 01:53:18.402
We've always said that
we couldn't afford...

01:53:18.527 --> 01:53:19.755
an extravagant salary.

01:53:22.007 --> 01:53:23.804
So they are 25.

01:53:30.367 --> 01:53:33.882
I don't think extravagant
is the exact word.

01:53:36.007 --> 01:53:39.397
I just want a decent wage...

01:53:41.087 --> 01:53:42.964
for a 33 years old married man.

01:53:43.647 --> 01:53:46.081
Are you only 33?
- Yes.

01:53:47.527 --> 01:53:50.200
How old are you, René?
- I'll be 34.

01:53:54.047 --> 01:53:58.677
Here there is some mistake.
- Oh, too much.

01:54:22.367 --> 01:54:23.686
You have painted me twice.

01:54:25.967 --> 01:54:27.195
Do you want to paint me naked?

01:54:32.167 --> 01:54:33.520
I can't do that anymore.

01:54:42.007 --> 01:54:43.440
You're too friendly.

01:54:44.007 --> 01:54:45.565
With who?
- With Vincent.

01:54:46.327 --> 01:54:48.318
That man is crazy.
He's incurable.

01:54:48.647 --> 01:54:51.241
A hopeless case.
I don't want you to see him again.

01:54:52.047 --> 01:54:54.402
You say that about
all the men I know.

01:54:56.807 --> 01:54:58.604
Daughter, please.

01:55:03.927 --> 01:55:07.636
Have you fed him?
- Yes, of course, but he doesn't want.

01:55:10.287 --> 01:55:13.802
I can't live here anymore.
I'm tired of going up and down...

01:55:13.927 --> 01:55:15.042
so many steps.

01:55:15.647 --> 01:55:19.083
The baby is heavier everyday.
I'm not a beast of burden.

01:55:20.847 --> 01:55:23.042
I've asked 3 times
for this apartment and...

01:55:23.167 --> 01:55:25.078
I've told you 3 times.
It's too expensive.

01:55:28.527 --> 01:55:31.246
Somebody's calling.
It must be Vincent.

01:55:31.527 --> 01:55:34.087
I can't open.
I'm not dressed.

01:55:35.767 --> 01:55:36.802
I'll open.

01:55:45.607 --> 01:55:46.596
Vincent is here.

01:55:50.447 --> 01:55:53.405
Yes, come in.
And be welcomed.

01:55:54.447 --> 01:55:57.280
I'll fed the baby.
You fed your brother.

01:56:24.567 --> 01:56:25.556
Give me that.

01:56:28.927 --> 01:56:30.883
I'll see them later.
- What's the matter?

01:56:31.007 --> 01:56:31.996
- Nothing.

01:56:35.527 --> 01:56:37.324
We're talking about...

01:56:39.407 --> 01:56:40.522
moving.

01:56:42.127 --> 01:56:45.403
She wants to move.
The steps are too much.

01:56:50.967 --> 01:56:52.286
Can you help me?

01:57:01.007 --> 01:57:02.156
I'll be right back.

02:01:49.327 --> 02:01:50.601
How is the baby?

02:01:52.807 --> 02:01:55.799
Vincent is fine.

02:02:04.127 --> 02:02:06.197
I don't have any
chance of living, have I?

02:02:20.607 --> 02:02:21.960
Can you fill my pipe?

02:04:39.407 --> 02:04:40.601
Vincent's friends:

02:04:43.087 --> 02:04:46.796
I want to say
some goodbye words.

02:04:51.367 --> 02:04:53.198
I knew him for a little time.

02:04:56.607 --> 02:04:57.756
But I love him a lot.

02:04:59.847 --> 02:05:00.836
He was so...

02:05:02.967 --> 02:05:03.956
My daughter...

02:05:06.207 --> 02:05:08.198
He was a part of the family.

02:05:12.287 --> 02:05:15.802
He was an honest man
and a good artist.

02:05:18.207 --> 02:05:20.596
He only have two
aims in his life:

02:05:22.047 --> 02:05:23.480
Humanity and art.

02:05:25.127 --> 02:05:29.086
And his art will live forever.

02:06:37.167 --> 02:06:38.395
I can't urinate.

02:07:49.607 --> 02:07:50.960
It's a series of rooms...

02:07:51.927 --> 02:07:54.395
like a museum or a gallery.

02:07:54.527 --> 02:07:56.040
A series of very
expensive rooms.

02:08:03.127 --> 02:08:06.563
It's just a place
where people can come.

02:08:06.687 --> 02:08:09.918
Where people can come
and see what he made.

02:08:11.087 --> 02:08:12.202
To look at his pictures.

02:08:15.727 --> 02:08:17.604
That's a gallery.

02:08:20.967 --> 02:08:22.559
It's very full, don't you think?

02:08:24.367 --> 02:08:26.358
It won't be any space
in those walls.

02:08:30.487 --> 02:08:31.522
That's the way it should be.

02:08:33.887 --> 02:08:35.206
Dinner is at 7 o'clock.

02:08:37.087 --> 02:08:38.406
We should go now.

02:08:46.967 --> 02:08:48.446
This it the most important...

02:08:53.007 --> 02:08:55.237
This is the most important thing
in my life.

02:09:03.567 --> 02:09:05.444
What are you doing here?

02:09:06.567 --> 02:09:09.445
This is Vincent's room.
Vincent's and mine.

02:09:15.287 --> 02:09:16.276
Out!

02:09:18.887 --> 02:09:21.162
Take your baby and go to Holland.

02:09:34.207 --> 02:09:38.997
What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

02:10:20.967 --> 02:10:21.956
Vincent.

02:10:28.287 --> 02:10:29.481
Where are you?

02:10:39.007 --> 02:10:40.440
Help me.

02:10:41.305 --> 02:10:47.183
