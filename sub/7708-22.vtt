WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:05.738
[Kate humming]

00:07.475 --> 00:10.142
Honey?
Is something wrong?

00:10.144 --> 00:12.244
I just got a chill,
as though something terrible

00:12.246 --> 00:14.413
is about to happen.

00:14.415 --> 00:17.316
It has to do with him.
I know it.

00:17.318 --> 00:21.653
These premonitions are becoming
more frequent, aren't they?

00:21.655 --> 00:25.157
Willie, Kate,
I have some disturbing news.

00:25.159 --> 00:29.561
- I told you. Didn't I tell you?
- That's just a coincidence.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.997
What disturbing news?

00:31.999 --> 00:34.600
I am deeply concerned..

00:34.602 --> 00:39.004
...about the amount of weight
I've put on recently.

00:39.006 --> 00:41.006
Oh, is that all?

00:41.008 --> 00:44.009
Well, you might find it
cute and adorable

00:44.011 --> 00:47.479
but I'm afraid that genetically,
I'm destined to die

00:47.481 --> 00:50.783
from the same fate
my grandparents died from.

00:50.785 --> 00:55.487
- And that is?
- Physical implosion.

00:55.489 --> 00:58.991
So far, this has
all been good news.

00:58.993 --> 01:01.026
I'll let that pass.

01:01.028 --> 01:03.095
You see,
when Melmacians gain weight

01:03.097 --> 01:06.131
our bodies become
denser and denser

01:06.133 --> 01:10.035
until finally,
we just burst from inside.

01:10.037 --> 01:14.039
You're saying that you only
gain weight internally?

01:14.041 --> 01:16.608
Yeah. It's a primitive
survival thing

01:16.610 --> 01:20.379
to ensure our clothes
always fit.

01:20.381 --> 01:24.783
Nature does have a way of taking
care of the important things.

01:24.785 --> 01:28.320
That is the most ludicrous thing
you have ever said.

01:28.322 --> 01:31.356
Well you wouldn't find humor
in it if you had to wet vac

01:31.358 --> 01:33.792
your grandparents
off the carpet.

01:35.329 --> 01:38.530
[theme music]

02:40.961 --> 02:46.165
(woman on TV)
'and one and two
and one and two and breathe.'

02:46.167 --> 02:49.234
'Okay, once again, inhale.'

02:49.236 --> 02:51.770
'And exhale.'

02:54.441 --> 02:55.908
'Ready?'

02:55.910 --> 03:00.879
'And up and back
and up and back.'

03:00.881 --> 03:04.249
- What are you doing?
- Exercising.

03:04.251 --> 03:07.553
This is the sixth time
I've watched this tape today.

03:07.555 --> 03:11.223
I can't wait to weigh myself.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.125
ALF, that's crazy.

03:13.127 --> 03:17.095
You can't lose weight just
by watching a workout tape.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.797
Come on. Get up.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.300
I'll show you
a couple of exercises.

03:21.302 --> 03:27.239
Okay, but I feel it only fair
to warn you I just ate.

03:27.241 --> 03:30.042
[grunting]

03:30.044 --> 03:33.245
- I ate a lot.
- I'll give you a hand.

03:37.017 --> 03:40.652
Let me, let me get my feet
in a better position here.

03:40.654 --> 03:43.355
Uh, use your legs, Willie.
Bend from the knees.

03:43.357 --> 03:46.558
[grunting]

03:50.397 --> 03:52.664
What's going on out here?

03:52.666 --> 03:54.866
It's not what you think.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.135
I'm trying to get ALF
up on his feet.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.204
You know, he is heavier
than he looks.

03:59.206 --> 04:03.775
Yes, but I'm still
a perfect size seven.

04:03.777 --> 04:08.880
Whoa! This is not embarrassing
at all.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.183
ALF, if you're really serious
about losing weight

04:11.185 --> 04:13.585
you're gonna have to start
exercising regularly

04:13.587 --> 04:15.821
and eating less.

04:15.823 --> 04:19.358
How about if I just gave up
eating your cooking?

04:19.360 --> 04:23.962
Oh, forget it. If he wants
to pork out, let him burst.

04:23.964 --> 04:27.699
- He doesn't care.
- I do. Oh, I'm just weak.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.402
I have no willpower, Will.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.604
I'm too young to implode.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.273
All I need is a little help.

04:34.275 --> 04:37.676
Would you help me?
Please help me.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.745
Alright. You heard him.

04:39.747 --> 04:43.815
Starting immediately, you're
going on a supervised diet.

04:43.817 --> 04:48.553
You're gonna be limited
to 1500 calories a day.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.722
No problem.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.824
Now, just out of curiosity

04:52.826 --> 04:55.627
how many calories are there
in a double cheeseburger

04:55.629 --> 04:58.263
large fries and chocolate shake?

04:58.265 --> 05:01.466
Eleven, what, twelve?

05:01.468 --> 05:04.069
I'd say probably 2100.

05:05.239 --> 05:07.205
[gasps]

05:07.207 --> 05:09.541
I'm in big trouble.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.410
I'll diet tomorrow.

05:18.085 --> 05:21.653
- Roast smells good, mom.
- Great. Here you go, ALF.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.589
- What's this?
- Supper.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.692
It's a joke, right?

05:26.694 --> 05:30.062
It's a watercress salad.
It's on your diet.

05:30.064 --> 05:33.932
Well, let's just take it off.

05:33.934 --> 05:38.337
Try it. I know it's tough, but
nobody wants to see you implode.

05:38.339 --> 05:41.973
Well, practically nobody.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.875
Where's the dressing?

05:43.877 --> 05:46.011
I squeezed lemon juice on it
for you.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.813
Oh, for a minute there,
I was worried

05:47.815 --> 05:51.483
it might be dry and tasteless.

05:51.485 --> 05:54.152
When you finish that you can
have some nice white rice

05:54.154 --> 05:57.122
and skinless broiled chicken.

05:57.124 --> 06:02.894
Oh, great. And maybe for dessert
I can have a ball of wax.

06:02.896 --> 06:09.234
Brian, ass-pe the eat-me
and otatoes-pe.

06:10.871 --> 06:14.906
Dad, you speak French.
What did he say?

06:14.908 --> 06:18.110
He said he wants seconds
on his salad.

06:18.112 --> 06:20.245
Look, I'm grateful for the help

06:20.247 --> 06:23.982
but Melmacians can't
crash diet like this.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.651
Sure they can.
All it takes is willpower.

06:26.653 --> 06:28.954
That's not what I mean.

06:28.956 --> 06:32.691
We have to lose weight
very, very slowly

06:32.693 --> 06:34.526
over a period of time.

06:34.528 --> 06:37.229
Say, 13 years.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.633
- Nice try.
- It's true.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.902
Crash dieting can cause
an imbalance

06:43.904 --> 06:46.037
in my enzyme system.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.273
I could be subject
to a chemical reaction

06:48.275 --> 06:53.111
that might make me revert back
to my primal instincts.

06:53.113 --> 06:56.815
Oh, for heaven's sake,
don't eat the damn salad.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.217
I'm serious.

06:59.219 --> 07:02.154
ALF, you pleaded with us
to help you lose weight.

07:02.156 --> 07:04.489
Now, if you think
I can be conned

07:04.491 --> 07:05.924
into letting you off the hook

07:05.926 --> 07:08.226
because of some
ridiculous story like that

07:08.228 --> 07:11.963
well, I'm a bigger fool
than you are.

07:11.965 --> 07:15.333
Well, in that case,
pass the gravy, fool.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.940
Okay, but I'm telling you

07:21.942 --> 07:25.143
it's gonna get<i> weird.</i>

07:31.285 --> 07:33.418
[mumbling]

07:33.420 --> 07:35.954
Ooh. Ah.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.522
Bacon grease.

07:37.524 --> 07:39.758
[sniffs]

07:39.760 --> 07:41.893
Soup's on.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.895
Oh! Uh.. Uh..

07:43.897 --> 07:46.097
[snoring]

07:48.068 --> 07:50.869
Don't wake the sleepwalker.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.938
Very dangerous.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.840
Very dangerous.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.410
You should be ashamed.

07:59.847 --> 08:03.315
Don't yell at the sleepwalker.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.983
Very humiliating.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.786
Very humiliating.

08:07.788 --> 08:11.990
ALF, is that a cockroach
on your shoulder?

08:11.992 --> 08:15.126
Aah! Where? Where?
Get it off! Get it off!

08:17.831 --> 08:20.499
I mean where am I?

08:22.035 --> 08:27.305
Who am I?
It's, it's all so confusing.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.074
Well, goodnight.

08:29.076 --> 08:34.579
Ah! Feet back, spread them.

08:34.581 --> 08:36.181
Hey, hey, am I the only one here

08:36.183 --> 08:38.450
with a salami
in his trench coat?

08:40.120 --> 08:43.321
This has been going on for,
for days.

08:43.323 --> 08:46.925
We're doing this for your,
for your own good.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.393
Don't you remember?

08:48.395 --> 08:52.163
Don't you remember
how you begged us to help you?

08:52.165 --> 08:54.132
Willie, I'm not kidding.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.968
I need food. Real food.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.070
I can feel
my primitive instincts

08:59.072 --> 09:01.172
starting to kick in.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.975
[howls]

09:03.977 --> 09:06.511
Who said that?

09:06.513 --> 09:11.816
Why do you insist on making
an opera out of everything?

09:11.818 --> 09:14.786
Part of my boyish charm,
I suppose.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.755
[growls]

09:16.757 --> 09:19.457
So where was I?

09:19.459 --> 09:22.193
You were saying something
about your boyish charm

09:22.195 --> 09:24.329
then you "grrr'd" at Willie.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.097
[gasps]

09:26.099 --> 09:29.434
Oh, no. I "grrr'd?"

09:29.436 --> 09:31.002
It's happening already.

09:31.004 --> 09:34.139
Once it starts,
I'm afraid I'll have to hunt

09:34.141 --> 09:38.543
and kill fresh meat
to replace my enzymes.

09:38.545 --> 09:41.913
- Goodnight, ALF.
- Happy hunting.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.783
Fine. Don't believe me.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.152
I'm going to need a loincloth.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.794
Hurry up, Bri,
you're gonna be late for school.

09:55.796 --> 10:00.865
Melon and rice cake,
120 calories.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.734
We're not all eating that,
are we?

10:02.736 --> 10:06.504
To answer your question, Bri,
no, it's just for ALF.

10:06.506 --> 10:08.540
Is he handling his diet
any better?

10:08.542 --> 10:10.809
Better?
No, I wouldn't say better.

10:10.811 --> 10:14.045
You should have seen the stunt
he tried to pull last night.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.848
Poor guy, this really
isn't very easy for him.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.951
Yesterday I caught him licking
all the empty trashcans

10:19.953 --> 10:24.456
and he offered me $5
not to tell any..

10:24.458 --> 10:26.124
Oops.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.327
[ALF yelling]

10:34.901 --> 10:37.102
[ALF yelling]

10:38.739 --> 10:41.172
ALF! You know better than
to yell outside

10:41.174 --> 10:42.474
in the yard like that.

10:42.476 --> 10:47.312
Whoa. Who you call ALF,
pale skin? Me Wolf.

10:47.314 --> 10:51.082
Primitive Melmacian
hunting machine.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.485
Pretty butch, huh?

10:53.487 --> 10:55.487
[howls]

10:57.791 --> 11:00.625
There's another thing
you're not good at.

11:00.627 --> 11:05.163
Oh. Guess Wolf need to get
knack of hunting thing.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.565
But got the look down. Yes?

11:09.102 --> 11:12.303
Dad, why is ALF acting this way?

11:12.305 --> 11:16.041
[chuckles]
It's an elaborate
and annoying ploy

11:16.043 --> 11:18.443
to get us to let him off
his diet.

11:18.445 --> 11:21.246
It seems to work on both levels.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.914
We're supposed to think
that ALF--

11:22.916 --> 11:24.349
Wolf.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.685
Name Bambi already taken.

11:26.687 --> 11:30.722
Wolf no match
for Disney legal department.

11:30.724 --> 11:34.192
Look, Wolf, knock it off!

11:36.129 --> 11:37.562
He wants us to believe

11:37.564 --> 11:40.765
that business about his enzymes
becoming unbalanced

11:40.767 --> 11:44.436
and that causing his
primal instincts to kick in.

11:44.438 --> 11:45.904
Silence!

11:45.906 --> 11:48.773
Wolf hear squirrel in distance.

11:48.775 --> 11:51.443
Brian, start hibachi.

11:51.445 --> 11:56.781
Here to good friend
Tonight kind of special

11:56.783 --> 11:58.416
- ALF--
- Wolf.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.751
Wolf.

11:59.753 --> 12:03.021
Come on in the house,
you've made your point.

12:03.023 --> 12:07.058
No good,
Wolf must trap and hunt own food

12:07.060 --> 12:11.329
before get too weak
and become food.

12:11.331 --> 12:14.099
Well, I don't really have time
for this.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.367
Thankfully,
I have to go to work.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.670
You're not leaving me alone
with Wolf, are you?

12:18.672 --> 12:22.807
No, no, let me call the office
and say I won't be in today

12:22.809 --> 12:26.377
because my alien's diet
has made him a warrior hunter.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.646
Silence, suburban ones.

12:28.648 --> 12:32.150
You scare prey
from hunting ground.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.687
See if you can get him
to eat something.

12:35.689 --> 12:37.455
I'll try to get home early.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.090
I'll stay home with you, Mom.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.925
Take your time.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.128
[growling]

12:50.370 --> 12:52.437
Any new developments
since I called?

12:52.439 --> 12:54.439
Nothing.
He slept most of the day.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.642
And refused to eat anything
he didn't hunt down himself.

12:57.644 --> 13:00.311
We even tried attaching a string
to a Pop-Tart

13:00.313 --> 13:01.646
pulling it across the lawn

13:01.648 --> 13:04.215
hoping he'd pounce on it
and kill it.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.717
Pretty pathetic.

13:05.719 --> 13:09.020
So he hasn't eaten anything
for two days.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.922
His only catch
was a garden snail.

13:10.924 --> 13:14.959
He let it go because he didn't
have any garlic and butter.

13:14.961 --> 13:19.264
Wolf said he might be primitive,
but he isn't a barbarian.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.199
Honey, I'm frightened.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.168
Yeah. Every time we go
into the backyard

13:23.170 --> 13:24.969
he throws a stick at us.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.138
What are we gonna do?

13:27.140 --> 13:29.240
Why do you automatically assume

13:29.242 --> 13:32.477
that I have the answers
for these questions?

13:32.479 --> 13:34.813
Should have read those
Smithsonian magazines

13:34.815 --> 13:36.648
you got me for Christmas.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.419
[ALF howls]

13:41.421 --> 13:43.154
[tires screeches]

13:43.156 --> 13:46.558
Oh, my Lord! Wolf just
drove off with our car.

14:01.641 --> 14:04.742
It's over.
He could be anywhere now.

14:04.744 --> 14:08.313
He could be half way
to Las Vegas by now.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.014
Shouldn't we keep looking
for him?

14:10.016 --> 14:13.585
Oh, honey, we've been all
up and down this neighborhood.

14:13.587 --> 14:15.620
Well, still,
we can't just give up.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.689
I don't know
what else we can do.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.758
We can't very well
scour the entire city.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.694
And we can't very well
call the police

14:22.696 --> 14:24.462
and tell them
there's a three-foot alien

14:24.464 --> 14:28.566
driving around in an '82 Ford
looking for fresh meat.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.735
Still, he's driving
without a license

14:30.737 --> 14:34.038
and I don't think
our insurance will cover us.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.241
[phone rings]

14:38.945 --> 14:40.445
Hello?

14:40.447 --> 14:42.280
Yes, this is Willie Tanner.

14:43.516 --> 14:46.784
Is there a problem, officer?

14:46.786 --> 14:47.952
Yes, that's our car.

14:47.954 --> 14:50.722
Did you happen to find
anything unusual in it?

14:52.259 --> 14:56.461
I-I think you'd know
what I mean.

14:58.064 --> 15:01.232
How it got there?

15:01.234 --> 15:03.501
Why, is there something wrong

15:03.503 --> 15:05.637
with the way my wife
parked my car?

15:07.407 --> 15:10.608
Well, you know women drivers.
Oh, sorry, ma'am.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.345
Thank you,
we'll take care of it.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.781
Yes, we will.

15:16.783 --> 15:19.584
Oh, yes.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.152
Goodbye.

15:21.154 --> 15:25.089
- Was there any sign of ALF?
- No.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.926
It seems Wolf is
running around loose

15:27.928 --> 15:30.061
somewhere in Griffith Park.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.596
Griffith Park?

15:31.598 --> 15:34.299
Honey, that park can be
very dangerous at this hour.

15:34.301 --> 15:38.403
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.505
I think I'll wait till morning.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.308
No, I mean dangerous to ALF.

15:43.310 --> 15:46.010
Oh. Of course you did.

15:46.012 --> 15:50.415
How silly of me to think of
myself just this once.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.016
Honey, do you want me
to go with you?

15:52.018 --> 15:55.253
No, no, no.
It's my own personal hell.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.755
I might as well enjoy it.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.290
Ah.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.435
ALF?

16:11.838 --> 16:13.371
Wolf?

16:19.279 --> 16:21.846
ALF.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.381
- Ah!
- Ah!

16:25.352 --> 16:28.987
Don't you know better than to
sneak up on someone like that?

16:28.989 --> 16:31.322
What if I had a guest over?

16:31.324 --> 16:33.524
Excuse me,
I wasn't expecting anyone.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.927
- Hey, I live here.
- I'm sorry.

16:37.630 --> 16:41.532
- Got a cigarette?
- No, I'm afraid I don't smoke.

16:41.534 --> 16:45.703
Good for you. Smoking's bad.

16:45.705 --> 16:49.007
Wish I could give them up,
but I'm under a lot of pressure.

16:50.944 --> 16:54.379
Say, uh, you haven't seen
anything strange

16:54.381 --> 16:56.247
or odd around here lately,
have you?

16:56.249 --> 16:59.384
Lately? Hm.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.586
Someone did throw a stick at me
earlier.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.522
I think it was that little guy
from Fantasy Island.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.525
What a way to end up.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.261
He must be very bitter.

17:10.263 --> 17:13.131
You didn't see which way
he went, did you?

17:13.133 --> 17:14.665
Hey, it's not my business.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.734
I try not to get involved.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.105
Hey, so, what's your story?

17:21.107 --> 17:23.141
When did life turn against you?

17:23.143 --> 17:25.143
[chuckles]

17:26.446 --> 17:28.679
Four years ago, September.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.449
Listen, I, uh,
I really have to go.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.084
Oh, sure. Sure.

17:33.086 --> 17:36.621
Hey, if you bump into
the little guy, be careful.

17:36.623 --> 17:39.023
He's really got a temper.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.025
[ALF howling]

17:46.766 --> 17:50.001
Ah. Say your prayers, Frenchie.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.538
[ALF howls]

17:55.175 --> 17:57.275
ALF.. Uh, Wolf.

17:57.277 --> 18:00.144
Oh. Big game.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.246
Wolf have block party tonight.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.115
B-Y-O-B.

18:05.852 --> 18:09.220
What were you about to do
to this little toy poodle?

18:09.222 --> 18:12.657
It no toy. It real.

18:12.659 --> 18:15.560
Oh, ALF, this is just
someone's runaway dog.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.995
Now listen, Wolf, listen to me.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.800
Will you stop that?

18:22.802 --> 18:27.138
Wolf too tired to hear
whiny man talk.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.841
Must consume food.

18:29.843 --> 18:32.643
Listen, listen,
I'm sorry I doubted you.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.679
I want you to come home now.
Come home with me.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.614
I'll give you all the food
you need.

18:36.616 --> 18:40.118
No. Must eat toy dog.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.321
ALF? Wolf? Whatever.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.589
Look at me.

18:44.591 --> 18:47.024
Don't you recognize me?

18:47.026 --> 18:49.227
Ah. Yes.

18:49.229 --> 18:52.096
You Zog, the timid hunter.

18:52.098 --> 18:55.867
I told you stay in cave,
finish bison mural.

18:55.869 --> 18:57.468
But no.

18:58.538 --> 19:01.005
It's me, Willie.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.107
Don't you remember?

19:03.109 --> 19:06.310
Lynn? Brian? Eric? Kate?

19:06.312 --> 19:08.179
[yells]

19:08.181 --> 19:10.314
Name bring fear.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.650
Not know why.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.752
(Willie)
Alright. Now.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.855
Look at this, look, look.
This is candy.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.056
[growling]

19:19.058 --> 19:20.691
Yes! Candy. Come on.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.126
This could make you better.

19:22.128 --> 19:23.761
This could make you
a lot better.

19:23.763 --> 19:27.665
Take it. Please. Eat it. Eat.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.735
Eat it for me, for Willie.

19:30.737 --> 19:34.272
- Zog.
- Zog.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.540
What heck.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.009
Wolf kill better on sugar high.

19:38.011 --> 19:40.077
Use Twinkie defense.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.913
[growling]

19:41.915 --> 19:45.950
No! No! Wait! Wolf?
Wolf, where are you going?

19:45.952 --> 19:47.718
Wolf! Wolf!

19:47.720 --> 19:49.754
(male #1)
'Uh, excuse me.'

19:50.723 --> 19:54.292
Look, I know you're new here

19:54.294 --> 19:55.626
but it's not really a good idea

19:55.628 --> 19:57.728
to be yelling "Wolf"
after 10 o'clock.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.765
Some of us have to get up early.

20:00.767 --> 20:04.936
I'm sorry.
It was very inconsiderate of me.

20:04.938 --> 20:06.671
A hut.

20:06.673 --> 20:10.174
Hey, you work fast.

20:10.176 --> 20:14.045
I've been here seven years.
Why didn't I think of that?

20:14.047 --> 20:16.614
Oh, it's just something
I slapped together.

20:16.616 --> 20:19.050
I see you've got yourself
a guard dog, too.

20:19.052 --> 20:22.019
A hut and a dog.
The American dream.

20:22.021 --> 20:25.389
I see things are really
coming together for you.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.124
Thank you, thank you.

20:27.126 --> 20:32.730
Well, oh, boy,
I guess I'll turn in now.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.333
Oh, I understand.
First night in a new hut.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.134
[chuckles]

20:37.136 --> 20:38.936
Ah, he'll be talking to himself
in a week.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.005
Shut up, what do you know?

20:43.576 --> 20:46.611
ALF, come on, come out of there.

20:48.214 --> 20:50.615
Oh, look. Dog.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.416
Stand back.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.352
Why? I just want to pet him.

20:54.354 --> 20:58.055
He's such
a cute little puppy dog.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.290
You're back.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.459
You're no longer
the brave, pathetic

21:01.461 --> 21:03.628
feeble, primitive warrior.

21:03.630 --> 21:07.698
Hey, you're no prize.

21:07.700 --> 21:11.402
Wait a minute. Where am I?

21:11.404 --> 21:14.772
Ah. You finally did it,
didn't you?

21:14.774 --> 21:18.843
You drove me to the woods
and dropped me off.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.845
But why did you
dress me like this?

21:20.847 --> 21:23.648
Was it just to humiliate me?
Huh?

21:23.650 --> 21:25.650
We'll talk later.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.451
Actually, I kind of like it.

21:27.453 --> 21:30.855
Kate's gonna wanna borrow
this outfit, I just know it.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.324
I wish she'd stay
out of my closet.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.026
Would you talk to her?

21:37.964 --> 21:39.830
- Thanks again for finding her.
- Oh, no problem.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.165
We were just glad
we were able to return her

21:41.167 --> 21:43.901
before anything life-shattering
could happen.

21:45.238 --> 21:47.204
[dog barking]

21:47.206 --> 21:49.940
Don't, don't,
don't open the door.

21:52.879 --> 21:55.513
Kate, did you know that
bacon grease

21:55.515 --> 21:57.915
mixed with butterscotch syrup

21:57.917 --> 22:01.018
makes a delightful marinade?

22:01.020 --> 22:04.288
I'll add that to my recipe file.

22:04.290 --> 22:08.125
It would be a shame
to disturb the cobwebs.

22:08.127 --> 22:11.228
I take it this is the end
of the hideous four-day diet?

22:11.230 --> 22:14.832
Absolutely.
I've got this eating thing down.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.635
In fact, I'm thinking
about writing a diet book.

22:17.637 --> 22:20.204
ALF's Fat for Life Diet.

22:20.206 --> 22:23.874
Could be a big seller
in the Bavarian countries.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.443
Nice try, pal

22:25.445 --> 22:27.111
but most of the weight you lost

22:27.113 --> 22:29.847
in the last two days
was water weight.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.016
Oh, ha-ha.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.752
You know, I should have
eaten you when I had the chance.

22:37.290 --> 22:38.322
[grumbles]

22:39.659 --> 22:42.860
[theme music]

23:10.890 --> 23:13.424
Ah-ha-ha-ha!
