{\an8}(Chloe)
Summer was finally over,

00:05.171 --> 00:06.464
{\an8}and as fall rolled in,

00:06.548 --> 00:08.675
{\an8}we all got
a major wakeup call.

00:08.758 --> 00:11.094
{\an1}She's (bleep)
using you, Garrett.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.512
{\an1}He came out of nowhere
and just punched me

00:12.595 --> 00:14.097
right in front of the ear.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.598
Who's keeping you
preoccupied?

00:15.682 --> 00:16.181
My girlfriend.

00:16.265 --> 00:18.017
Doesn't seem like it.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.811
{\an5}(Chloe)
Kelsey and Garrett
had allegedly

00:19.894 --> 00:21.271
moved on from each other...

00:21.354 --> 00:21.980
I told you I loved you.

00:22.063 --> 00:24.274
And I told you I loved you.

00:24.357 --> 00:27.485
But that was clearly
a big lie.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.196
We went to his house
and I just passed out.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.448
{\an3}What?

00:31.531 --> 00:33.783
They didn't care
who they hurt along the way.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.201
No, no, no,
nothing happened.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.786
And even though
Juliette and I

00:36.870 --> 00:38.496
weren't really that tight,

00:38.580 --> 00:40.415
telling her
was the right thing to do.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.709
{\an1}Kelsey was at Garrett's
house all night last night.

00:42.792 --> 00:45.170
What a slut!

00:45.253 --> 00:47.088
She was so hurt.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.549
{\an1}You say you're
so different than Alex,

00:49.632 --> 00:51.843
but you're just
as bad, Garrett.

00:51.926 --> 00:54.554
But Juliette was just
playing up the victim card.

00:54.637 --> 00:55.889
We'd soon find out

00:55.972 --> 00:58.975
she wasn't as innocent
as everyone thought.

00:59.058 --> 01:01.352
{\an1}Canvas is gonna
get me in trouble.

01:01.436 --> 01:02.812
(Canvas)
All I do is trouble.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.063
Brandon and Madisson weren't
doing any better.

01:05.147 --> 01:07.233
{\an5}If you come for her,
it's gonna be
like a big problem.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.778
{\an1}I don't owe anyone
my loyalty.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.988
I'm just very confused.
I don't--

01:12.071 --> 01:13.948
{\an1}Wait, what are you
confused about?

01:14.032 --> 01:16.659
Brandon and Garrett
were both turning out

01:16.743 --> 01:17.410
to be a little sketchy.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.579
{\an1}Garrett plays
the quiet card,

01:19.662 --> 01:22.332
{\an1}but really he can talk
the birds out of the tress.

01:22.415 --> 01:26.669

to pay the consequences.

{\an8}Take Madisson there.

02:28.481 --> 02:29.649
{\an7}She's probably pissed at me,

02:29.732 --> 02:30.650
{\an8}You might want to do that.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.861

02:32.944 --> 02:34.571
{\an8}I mean, I saw you
and Canvas kind of, uh...

02:34.654 --> 02:36.906
{\an1}Well, man, I was drinking
a little more

02:38.533 --> 02:40.743

{\an1}So she's probably
mad at me.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.287
But I tried to tell her

we're both sober,

02:44.247 --> 02:46.624

{\an7}Because I was pissed
because Kelsey and Garrett

03:22.368 --> 03:25.371
{\an1}were talking,
and I found out from Chloe

03:25.455 --> 03:27.957
{\an1}that Kelsey slept over
at his house...

03:28.041 --> 03:29.751
the night before.

{\an5}The night before the party?

03:29.834 --> 03:32.128
{\an1}Yeah.

03:32.211 --> 03:33.671
He said nothing happened,

03:33.755 --> 03:36.633
{\an1}and I'm like,
"That's bull(bleep)."

03:36.716 --> 03:39.135
{\an1}I mean, regardless,
she still slept at his house.

03:39.218 --> 03:42.221
Yeah, why?
What was the point?

03:42.305 --> 03:43.932

Exactly.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.145
I'm so over people

{\an1}Have fun.
You're young.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.858
There's still, like,
no reason for her

03:53.942 --> 03:57.487
{\an5}to stay the night
over there.

03:53.942 --> 03:57.487
{\an1}Exactly.

{\an1}The fact that I had to
find out from Chloe, too,

04:00.281 --> 04:01.574
I'm so over that.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.201
{\an1}He'd be like, "Oh, I was
going to tell you."

04:03.284 --> 04:05.161
{\an1}And I'm like, "Then why didn't
I hear it from you first?"

{\an7}At Hannah's party,
I went up to Canvas.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.954
{\an8}I know, I saw.

04:48.037 --> 04:49.622
{\an8}What'd you say?

Don't create any trouble.

She's creating the trouble
by talking to Brandon,

05:05.805 --> 05:08.224
{\an1}but then again, it's, like,
partially Brandon,

05:08.307 --> 05:09.642
{\an5}because they're,
like, sitting...

05:08.307 --> 05:09.642

{\an3}I know.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.360
{\an1}I mean, with what he's
going through right now.

07:24.443 --> 07:26.237
{\an1}I know it meant the world
to him,

07:26.320 --> 07:29.073
{\an1}you coming to see him
the other day, Madisson.

07:29.157 --> 07:32.034
{\an5}It was good to see him.
I hadn't seen him
in a while, so...

07:32.118 --> 07:34.912
When was that?

07:34.996 --> 07:37.874
Um, I went and saw Alex
the other day to, like,

07:37.957 --> 07:42.461
talk to him about his jaw
and everything, so...

07:42.545 --> 07:45.089
{\an1}Does anyone think
he deserved it?

07:45.173 --> 07:47.049
It was tough to
see him like that.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.385
{\an4}(Paul)
I don't think anybody
would deserve that.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.385
{\an3}Yeah.

07:49.468 --> 07:50.928
Madisson, can I talk
to you?

07:51.012 --> 07:52.221
{\an3}Yeah.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.474
All right.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.852
Hope I didn't pour
gasoline on a fire

07:57.935 --> 08:00.771
{\an1}mentioning the whole
Madisson going to see Alex.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.565
(Chloe)
She should've told him.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.734
(Kelsey)
I thought he knew.

08:04.817 --> 08:08.070
I didn't know you met up
with Alex the other night.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.743
I guess I didn't think
to, like, mention it.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.828
{\an1}The last time
that you were with Alex,

08:15.912 --> 08:18.873
{\an1}he was trying
to rekindle the fire.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.125
That (bleep) pisses me off.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.126
You're one to talk

08:22.210 --> 08:23.794
after the way you were
behaving with Canvas

08:23.878 --> 08:25.880
at Hannah's party.

08:25.963 --> 08:29.258
Yeah, I was being a little more
flirtatious and touchy with...

08:29.342 --> 08:31.636
{\an3}Yeah.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.636
...that girl Canvas.

08:31.719 --> 08:34.931
{\an1}I just want to let you know
that that's like...

08:35.014 --> 08:36.474
there's nothing there.

08:37.975 --> 08:39.894
{\an1}I mean, she's a cool girl,
like she does music and stuff,

08:39.977 --> 08:41.187
{\an1}but there's nothing
like that--

08:41.270 --> 08:43.813
Oh, Brandon.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.609
Trouble in paradise.

08:46.692 --> 08:50.196
{\an1}From the talks we've had,
he really like Madisson a lot.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.281
{\an1}If Brandon feels this way,
then he needs to, like,

08:52.365 --> 08:53.950
start expressing them.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.284
{\an5}It sucks to, like...

08:54.033 --> 08:55.284
{\an1}For sure.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.245
see some girl
all over you.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.538
From what I've heard
from other people, too,

08:59.622 --> 09:02.166
{\an1}like, she doesn't care
that you have a girlfriend.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.419
It just-- It was hard
to see that,

09:05.503 --> 09:06.295
and then when you--
when we talked,

09:06.379 --> 09:08.881
you said
you were confused.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.925
{\an1}I literally was
coming from a place

09:11.008 --> 09:12.510
{\an1}not even confused
about us.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.303
{\an1}I was just confused
about the whole situation.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.138
{\an1}On top of had a little
too much to drink.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.473
It is, like,
a little concerning

09:17.557 --> 09:19.850
{\an5}to hear your boyfriend
say, "I'm confused
about where we are."

09:19.934 --> 09:21.227
{\an1}Absolutely, yeah, no,
for sure.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.812
{\an1}And I really don't want you
to feel that way.

09:22.895 --> 09:23.938
{\an4}(Paul)
Maybe Brandon
just needs a girl

09:24.021 --> 09:27.650
{\an1}that is ready to
chase him.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.235
{\an1}She like verbatimly told me
that she's like,

09:29.318 --> 09:31.279
{\an1}"I'm gonna go
after him because..."

09:31.362 --> 09:32.822
{\an5}Wait, she said that?

09:31.362 --> 09:32.822
She told me this.

09:32.905 --> 09:33.864
That she's gonna go after him.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.116
Yeah, she told me this.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.492
{\an1}She's like, "Madisson,
they don't look like

09:36.575 --> 09:37.827
they're together at all."

09:37.910 --> 09:39.829

he's in a relationship.

had seen that,

Just hanging out today.

11:47.957 --> 11:48.958
{\an5}Good to see you.

{\an3}Mwah.

Whatcha doing?

11:49.959 --> 11:51.293

11:49.959 --> 11:51.293
{\an3}Yeah?

11:51.377 --> 11:53.295
{\an1}Just like perfecting a bunch
of music I have right now.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.464
{\an8}EJ, from the studio
I've been going to,

11:55.548 --> 11:58.634
{\an7}just got in contact
with a huge music guy.

11:58.717 --> 12:01.220
His name is Mac Lawless.

12:01.303 --> 12:03.472
{\an1}EJ sent out some of the tracks
that I was doing.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.473
{\an1}And I guess it just
caught Mac's attention.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.476
Oh, my gosh,
that is great.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.270
{\an4}It's huge.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.270
And who's he been
working with?

12:09.353 --> 12:12.064
{\an1}Huge artists like Future,
I've heard Rick Ross.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.942
{\an1}I know you don't listen to
a lot of hip-hop rap like that.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.277
I know who Rick Ross is.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.153
{\an1}But yeah, okay, yeah.
You know who Rick Ross is.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.655
{\an1}This could be, like,
really big for me.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.073
{\an1}This could change my career,
could change everything.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.324
Change my life.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.326
How does Madisson feel
about all this?

12:24.410 --> 12:26.036
'Cause the touring
and not being around

12:26.120 --> 12:27.413
{\an5}can, can be a strain
sometimes.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.413
{\an1}Um...

12:27.496 --> 12:29.707
I-I really don't know.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.834
{\an1}I haven't had that conversation
with her, but...

12:31.917 --> 12:34.003
Now, you talk to her
about it now

12:34.086 --> 12:35.588
and let her know
how important she is

12:35.671 --> 12:37.256
and how she feels about
certain things

12:37.339 --> 12:39.175
{\an5}is very important.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.175
{\an1}But...

12:39.258 --> 12:40.801
{\an1}I actually have to go
meet with Mac now.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.720
{\an1}Yes, yeah! You're meeting him

12:42.803 --> 12:44.680
{\an4}Yep.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.680
You're not wearing this.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.015
No, I'm wearing this.

You're gonna wear this
to go and meet him

12:47.516 --> 12:48.517

12:47.516 --> 12:48.517
{\an1}Yeah.

You ever been in a studio

13:19.673 --> 13:21.550
{\an1}I've been in a studio maybe
half the size of this.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.469

13:27.806 --> 13:29.975
{\an1}So, yeah, man,
I was just, uh, wrapping up,

13:30.059 --> 13:32.728
{\an4}running through
the music you sent me.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.728
Okay, awesome.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.939
And it's okay, you know.
I'll be honest with you.

13:35.022 --> 13:38.108
{\an1}It's what I would qualify
as like a mixtape, if you will.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.861
So, is this more like a hobby
or are you really wanting...

13:40.945 --> 13:43.447
{\an6}No, no...

13:40.945 --> 13:43.447
...to like make this a thing?

13:43.531 --> 13:45.199

13:45.282 --> 13:46.534
for the rest of my life.

13:46.617 --> 13:49.703
{\an1}Where it is right now,
I'd rate it as like a "C."

13:49.787 --> 13:51.163
You know, C-minus.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.873
{\an1}Right now, it just--
it's not there.

13:52.957 --> 13:56.293
What do I gotta do
to get to that quality?

13:56.377 --> 13:59.630
If anything you know about me,
I'll get it done, I'll deliver.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.924
{\an5}I don't want to be
in the "C" range.
I want to get to a "A."

14:02.007 --> 14:05.344
{\an1}I think we should do a little
session, see if we vibe.

14:05.427 --> 14:08.180
{\an1}I think that'll kinda decide
our, our relationship

Like I'm, I'm ready for that,
I'm not...

14:51.765 --> 14:54.268
{\an7}How's the, uh,
the job search going?

14:54.351 --> 14:56.478
It's not going well.

14:56.562 --> 14:57.646
I'm, like,
kind of losing hope

14:57.730 --> 15:00.399
that, like, there is anything
in Siesta Key for me.

15:00.482 --> 15:01.442
{\an5}It's gonna take time.

15:00.482 --> 15:01.442
Is it just that it takes time

15:01.525 --> 15:03.694
or is it that like engineering
is not for me?

15:03.777 --> 15:05.696
Are you passionate
about it?

15:05.779 --> 15:08.824
I don't know,
this is just now

15:08.907 --> 15:11.076
becoming like an issue
where it's like...

15:11.160 --> 15:13.495
did I actually
go into engineering

15:13.579 --> 15:14.455
because I'm passionate
about engineering,

15:14.538 --> 15:16.582
or just 'cause,
like, I'm good at it,

15:16.665 --> 15:18.792
{\an5}and, like, I liked being
good at it?

15:16.665 --> 15:18.792
{\an3}Yeah.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.836
Or is it just
that I'm having trouble now

15:20.919 --> 15:22.338
and, like, that's just
discouraging me

15:22.421 --> 15:23.047
and making me
rethink all these things?

15:23.130 --> 15:24.923
It's confusing,
I'm sure.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.175
Nothing cheese can't solve.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.676
{\an5}(laughter)

15:26.258 --> 15:27.676
Nothing a little cheese...

15:27.760 --> 15:29.720
{\an5}And champagne.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.720
{\an3}Yes.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.597
(cell phone chiming)

15:31.680 --> 15:32.931
Brandon!

15:33.015 --> 15:34.600
{\an3}Boyfriend!

15:34.683 --> 15:36.644
{\an8}Hey, babe.

15:36.727 --> 15:39.355
{\an8}How are you?
Are you coming over?

15:46.487 --> 15:48.697
{\an5}(Madisson)
Oh. I want you to come
see the place.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.576
{\an9}Okay.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.576
{\an8}Sounds like he's not coming.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.249
Well, that's fine.
That's exciting.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.044
I'm glad that it's...
going well.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.255
{\an3}Oh!

16:10.469 --> 16:12.554
{\an8}Okay.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.181
{\an8}(Kelsey)
Did you ever try this one?

16:14.264 --> 16:15.349
{\an9}(Madisson)
All right.

16:14.264 --> 16:15.349
{\an4}No.

16:15.432 --> 16:16.642
{\an9}It's good.

16:16.725 --> 16:17.976
Bye.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.816
Um... Brandon's not coming.

16:25.317 --> 16:25.818
{\an3}Seriously?

16:25.901 --> 16:28.362
Something in the studio.

16:28.445 --> 16:30.489
One hour isn't asking
so much as a girlfriend.

16:30.572 --> 16:31.865
{\an1}I know.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.951
He asked to prioritize
that, though.

16:34.034 --> 16:36.245
You make so many
excuses for him.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.580
{\an1}First he didn't, like,
help you move in,

16:38.664 --> 16:40.958
and then he's, like,
flirting with Canvas.

16:42.626 --> 16:43.836
{\an1}If you don't keep
an eye on her, I will.

16:43.919 --> 16:44.920
{\an3}Yeah.

{\an6}Yeah.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.169
Just the fact that...

17:25.252 --> 17:28.881
{\an1}you guys were at your house,
you didn't tell me.

17:28.964 --> 17:30.674
{\an1}Obviously, like word of mouth
got around

quicker than

17:32.050 --> 17:32.843
When were you planning

17:32.926 --> 17:34.303
{\an6}That day.

17:32.926 --> 17:34.303
You were gonna--

17:34.386 --> 17:35.888
What, were you gonna tell me
that night after the party?

17:35.971 --> 17:39.558
Not after the party,
but eventually.

17:39.641 --> 17:42.144
Obviously, I knew that you
probably assumed the worst,

17:42.227 --> 17:44.229
which you did.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.773
You know,
you got trust issues

17:45.856 --> 17:47.649
like with you and Alex is
probably why you snapped.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.860
You know, like, it's hard
for you to trust a guy.

17:49.943 --> 17:50.736
But I'm not like that.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.362
Um, she slept over, yeah.

17:52.446 --> 17:56.158
{\an1}Like, I'll admit to that
because that's what you heard.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.576
Do you still care about her?

17:58.952 --> 17:59.953
{\an3}Um...

18:02.289 --> 18:04.625
This is just crazy.

18:04.708 --> 18:05.209
{\an3}Um...

18:08.504 --> 18:11.298
Well, I'm glad that
we're, like, here now.

18:11.381 --> 18:14.551
{\an1}I don't like that Kelsey's
still around so much.

18:14.635 --> 18:17.179
{\an1}You guys broke up,
like, three months ago.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.764
Yeah, I mean, I can see that.

18:18.847 --> 18:20.849
But at the end of the day,
like, I'm not gonna, like,

18:20.933 --> 18:23.310
totally just put somebody
out of my life.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.480
I mean, I was really
her only friend

18:26.563 --> 18:28.023
when she first moved here,
you know? Like...

18:28.106 --> 18:29.900
{\an1}I mean, I know that you want
to stay friends with her,

18:29.983 --> 18:32.945
{\an1}but, like, we're going
to Chloe's party.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.072
{\an1}And I don't want
you guys hanging out.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.241
{\an1}Like, I don't even like
seeing you guys talk.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.119
{\an1}I feel like you should
understand that, you know?

18:41.203 --> 18:42.204
{\an3}Yeah.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.290
{\an1}I don't want to have to
worry about her.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.170
{\an5}(Chloe)
Garrett should have listened
and stayed away from Kelsey.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.714
'Cause Juliette was about
to strike back

18:52.798 --> 18:54.258
in a big way.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.390
{\an7}(Juliette)
Tell me if I'm crazy

19:01.473 --> 19:02.558
{\an8}for acting the way that I am.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.310
{\an7}Kelsey slept
at Garrett's house.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.230
{\an7}They both said that
nothing happened.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.482
That's shady.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.482
{\an1}Right?

19:10.566 --> 19:11.859
{\an5}Well, just listen.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.859
{\an3}Oh, Jules!

19:11.942 --> 19:13.402
I know, I know, I know,
'cause I've already been

19:13.485 --> 19:15.237
in this situation
before with Alex.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.864
{\an1}And it looks
really bad, but...

19:16.947 --> 19:19.575
What's your gut telling you?

19:19.658 --> 19:22.703
{\an1}I just, I just don't
trust her, like...

19:22.786 --> 19:24.913
I wouldn't trust her
either, honestly.

19:25.622 --> 19:26.582
That's like his kryptonite.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.585
I feel like they are
like that with each other.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.587
Like you and Alex.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.963
Once you love somebody
for real,

19:33.046 --> 19:33.839
you usually
don't stop, so...

19:33.922 --> 19:36.258
{\an5}See, that's...

19:33.922 --> 19:36.258
{\an3}It's hard.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.968
{\an1}...like, kind of
a huge issue.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.178
Sounds like
it's going downhill.

19:40.262 --> 19:43.056
{\an1}I can't just get her,
like, away.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.601
{\an1}I just can't
get her out of my life.

19:45.684 --> 19:46.977
Maybe that's just something

19:47.060 --> 19:48.520
you don't have
to deal with then.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.481
Here's the thing.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.151
{\an1}I told him, "If you
talk to her at all tonight,

19:54.234 --> 19:56.111
like, I'm gonna lose it."

19:56.194 --> 19:58.989
{\an6}Smart.

19:56.194 --> 19:58.989
"So, like, you're not
associating with her.

19:59.072 --> 20:02.284
{\an5}I'm not having it--"

19:59.072 --> 20:02.284

a tight leash already.

sleeps at your house.

{\an5}Like, she's just gonna--

20:05.120 --> 20:06.747
Is she gonna
go to Chloe's Tiki thing?

20:06.830 --> 20:10.417
{\an4}Yeah, she's supposed to--
I mean, Chloe's, like,
her best friend now.

20:10.500 --> 20:11.668
{\an1}So...

20:10.500 --> 20:11.668

20:13.879 --> 20:15.505
{\an5}None of my friends are going.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.505
Oh, I wish I was too.

20:15.589 --> 20:19.384

{\an5}(Dr. Negroski)
So, the last time
you were in,

21:36.336 --> 21:39.256
{\an8}as you recall, with your
MRI of your brain,

21:39.339 --> 21:42.968
{\an8}you had a couple of spots
in your brain.

21:43.051 --> 21:44.386
{\an4}Yeah.

21:43.051 --> 21:44.386
And so we were worried

21:44.469 --> 21:48.432
{\an1}if you had anything like MS,
or what those spots were.

21:48.515 --> 21:49.933
So, if you look at the scan,

21:50.017 --> 21:53.478
{\an1}we do have about four spots
on your brain

21:53.562 --> 21:54.479
that are very small.

21:54.563 --> 21:58.734
They're kind of
not in a typical location

21:58.817 --> 22:03.780
that you can see
in patients with MS.

22:03.864 --> 22:08.035
{\an1}Right now you don't
fulfill the criteria for MS.

22:08.118 --> 22:10.203
{\an1}This is why
I didn't want to bring her.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.705

{\an5}that you don't have MS.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.918
Okay, I'm glad you're crying

22:17.002 --> 22:19.337
{\an5}happy tears, but--

22:17.002 --> 22:19.337
Why would I be sad?

your concerns about MS,

{\an5}I think we can put that
way down on the list.

22:24.760 --> 22:28.555
{\an1}Good.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.183
{\an6}I mean...

22:28.638 --> 22:31.183
Is it mainly
the rheumatoid arthritis?

22:31.266 --> 22:33.602
With the rheumatoid arthritis,

22:33.685 --> 22:37.147
{\an1}that can cause inflammation
of joints and cause headaches.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.733
So, I think that's probably

22:39.816 --> 22:41.860
where your headaches
are coming from.

22:41.943 --> 22:45.655
{\an5}So we'll set up
