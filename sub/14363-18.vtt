WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:04.467
[Sheep bleating]

00:05.403 --> 00:06.670
So, who's gonna do it?

00:06.671 --> 00:08.103
- I don't want to do it.
- Well, I'm not doing it.

00:08.105 --> 00:09.473
- Can Brick do it?
- He's just a kid.

00:09.474 --> 00:10.574
You can't ask him to do it.

00:10.575 --> 00:12.476
Okay.

00:12.477 --> 00:14.077
I will do it.

00:14.078 --> 00:15.312
Frankie: <i>What's more nerve-wracking</i>

00:15.313 --> 00:17.948
<i>than getting into college?</i>

00:17.949 --> 00:20.317
<i>Opening the financial-aid package.</i>

00:20.318 --> 00:22.085
Should I do it fast or slow?

00:22.086 --> 00:23.720
Fast. No, slow! No, fast!

00:23.721 --> 00:25.455
Oh, God, I can't remember
the band-aid rule.

00:25.456 --> 00:26.456
Just open it!

00:26.457 --> 00:28.358
Okay.

00:28.359 --> 00:29.359
Uh...

00:29.360 --> 00:31.261
What's it say? What's it say?

00:31.262 --> 00:33.029
Uh... I don't know.

00:33.030 --> 00:35.131
Is this for one year or four years?

00:35.132 --> 00:36.800
Oh, my God, how can I go to college

00:36.801 --> 00:38.635
if I can't even figure out
the financial-aid letter?!

00:38.636 --> 00:39.703
[Breathing heavily]

00:39.704 --> 00:42.572
I see room and board. I see tuition.

00:42.573 --> 00:44.574
Yes. They're giving us
everything we needed!

00:44.575 --> 00:45.842
We're poor!

00:45.843 --> 00:47.477
Whoo! [Laughs]

00:47.478 --> 00:49.746
- Yeah! We did it!
- Oh! Whoo!

00:49.747 --> 00:52.382
I told you we were poor enough.
I never stopped believing.

00:52.383 --> 00:54.184
You know, if we'd have
worked a little bit harder,

00:54.185 --> 00:55.419
none of this would be possible.

00:55.420 --> 00:57.187
Oh, I just love America so much!

00:57.188 --> 00:58.889
Oh, hell, I love America, too.

00:58.890 --> 01:00.690
America's the best! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:00.691 --> 01:01.892
[Gasps]

01:01.893 --> 01:03.927
This means I can go to
prospective-students weekend!

01:03.928 --> 01:05.095
Ahh!

01:05.096 --> 01:06.797
Mom, do you think Axl would
let me stay with him?

01:06.798 --> 01:07.931
Come on, Sue.

01:07.932 --> 01:09.365
We can't ask for two miracles in one day.

01:10.401 --> 01:11.401
[Chuckling] Mm!

01:11.402 --> 01:12.469
[School bell rings]

01:12.470 --> 01:13.503
[Knock on door]

01:13.504 --> 01:15.071
Hey, Dr. fulton. You got a second?

01:15.072 --> 01:16.440
Yeah. Uh, come on. Yeah, come on in.

01:16.441 --> 01:17.474
Have a seat.

01:17.475 --> 01:20.310
So, what can I help you with?

01:20.311 --> 01:23.113
Well, I'm hatching a plan to
infiltrate a friend group.

01:23.114 --> 01:24.581
- Uh-huh.
- [Clears throat]

01:24.582 --> 01:26.883
Uh...

01:26.884 --> 01:29.686
Is <i> this</i> the friend group
you're talking about?

01:29.687 --> 01:31.288
- No.
- Ah!

01:31.289 --> 01:33.190
I've singled out a few kids
in my robotics club...

01:33.191 --> 01:34.291
Dante and Parker.

01:34.292 --> 01:35.559
Their friend Max is moving to New York

01:35.560 --> 01:37.360
because his parents think
he can do commercials.

01:37.361 --> 01:40.697
I personally don't see
it, but I wish him luck.

01:40.698 --> 01:43.133
Anyway, this is my chance to
get in with the other two.

01:43.134 --> 01:44.701
They're gonna need a new third.

01:44.702 --> 01:45.702
Ohh, I don't know.

01:45.703 --> 01:47.437
When it comes to friendship,

01:47.438 --> 01:49.439
three isn't <i> always</i> a good number.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.540
[Chuckles]

01:50.541 --> 01:51.875
Have you not heard of the third wheel?

01:51.876 --> 01:52.943
It's classic.

01:52.944 --> 01:54.444
Like in a tricycle...

01:54.445 --> 01:56.446
The third wheel is what provides stability.

01:56.447 --> 01:58.315
Okay, well, what about these boys

01:58.316 --> 02:00.617
makes you think they'll
be receptive to you?

02:00.618 --> 02:02.452
Well, Parker got assigned
to me in science lab,

02:02.453 --> 02:03.753
and he didn't groan.

02:03.754 --> 02:05.388
And the whole time we worked
together, he tolerated me.

02:05.389 --> 02:08.458
Ooh, tolerating is progress.

02:08.459 --> 02:09.860
I'm gonna make my move this Saturday

02:09.860 --> 02:11.728
on the trip to the robotics
exhibit at the museum.

02:11.729 --> 02:14.364
Mm. [Clears throat]

02:14.365 --> 02:16.132
Pretend this is the bus. Ah.

02:16.133 --> 02:17.367
[Clears throat]

02:17.368 --> 02:19.636
When we're lining up to get on,

02:19.637 --> 02:22.272
I slip in between Dante and Parker.

02:22.273 --> 02:25.275
Once we're in, Dante sits down first.

02:25.276 --> 02:26.843
I immediately sit next to him.

02:26.844 --> 02:28.745
If for some reason that doesn't work,

02:28.746 --> 02:30.914
I've got Parker right
behind me as a backup.

02:30.915 --> 02:32.916
I'm guaranteed to sit with one of them.

02:32.917 --> 02:34.417
That's a good plan.

02:34.418 --> 02:36.686
But remember... once
you're in, do not leave,

02:36.687 --> 02:39.189
all right, because... well,
here, let me show you.

02:39.190 --> 02:44.160
Once, I... I left to go get
a coffee stirrer, right?

02:44.161 --> 02:45.829
Then the next thing I know,

02:45.830 --> 02:47.831
that ponytailed, tofu-head barista

02:47.832 --> 02:49.533
is sitting with Shelly.

02:49.534 --> 02:51.835
They're getting married on Saturday.

02:51.836 --> 02:53.203
Yeah.

02:53.204 --> 02:55.705
Do you know I can't drink
coffee anymore, Brick?

02:55.706 --> 02:57.040
I did not.

02:57.041 --> 02:58.375
[Groans]

02:58.376 --> 02:59.942
[Toy clatters] [Sighs]

03:02.446 --> 03:04.680
[Cellphone vibrates]

03:04.681 --> 03:06.549
Oh, my God!

03:06.550 --> 03:08.351
My sister's coming for the weekend.

03:08.352 --> 03:09.785
Aw! Lucky.

03:09.786 --> 03:11.387
Yeah. So lucky.

03:11.388 --> 03:12.421
Hold up.

03:12.422 --> 03:13.756
When you call Sue a loser

03:13.757 --> 03:15.257
and tell her she has a face like a butt

03:15.258 --> 03:17.059
and if they wrote a book
about her, it'd be called

03:17.060 --> 03:18.561
"are you there God? It's me, Dorkaret,"

03:18.562 --> 03:19.862
you're just joking, right?

03:19.863 --> 03:21.630
'Cause I'm super tight with my family.

03:21.631 --> 03:23.432
So, if all that mean stuff was for real

03:23.433 --> 03:25.901
and you didn't have a good
relationship with your sister,

03:25.902 --> 03:28.236
that'd be a deal breaker for me.

03:29.606 --> 03:31.874
Duh. Obvi, I'm joking. [Laughs]

03:31.875 --> 03:32.908
Oh. [Laughs]

03:33.609 --> 03:35.610
Ah, it's a good thing you get my comedy

03:35.611 --> 03:38.246
'cause if you didn't, that'd
be a deal breaker for <i> me.</i>

03:38.247 --> 03:39.481
[Laughs]

03:39.482 --> 03:41.283
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to text my sis.

03:41.284 --> 03:44.092
God, I love her so much.

03:44.093 --> 03:45.163
[Chuckles]

03:46.089 --> 03:47.822
- [Cellphone beeps]
- Oh!

03:49.592 --> 03:53.601
Um, I texted Axl if I could
stay with him this weekend,

03:53.602 --> 03:54.929
and he just texted back,

03:54.930 --> 03:57.384
"awesome, can't wait to see you."

03:57.385 --> 03:59.177
Is there an emoticon with it,

03:59.178 --> 04:00.817
- like sad face barfing?
- No.

04:00.818 --> 04:02.470
Hey, maybe it's an April fools' joke.

04:02.471 --> 04:04.148
That's still a few days away.

04:04.149 --> 04:07.089
Oh, but maybe he's setting me up
for something when I'm there.

04:07.090 --> 04:08.826
You know what? I don't care!

04:08.827 --> 04:10.585
I'm going to college for the weekend!

04:10.586 --> 04:11.808
Whoo!

04:13.348 --> 04:15.817
Oh, hey, mom, what snacks are
you bringing on the field trip?

04:15.818 --> 04:17.118
What are you talking about?

04:17.457 --> 04:19.358
You signed up to chaperone the field trip

04:19.358 --> 04:21.427
to the robotics exhibit in
Indianapolis on Saturday.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.629
Mm, that doesn't sound like me.

04:23.630 --> 04:26.331
Yeah. Remember back in
September when I asked you?

04:26.332 --> 04:27.332
Do you want to do

04:27.333 --> 04:28.834
the back-to-school breakfast next week?

04:28.835 --> 04:30.002
Ew. No.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.403
- Halloween party?
- Negatory.

04:31.404 --> 04:32.905
Thanksgiving feed the homeless?

04:32.906 --> 04:34.473
Too soon. Don't stop till you hit April.

04:34.474 --> 04:35.908
You want to do one of the later ones,

04:35.909 --> 04:37.376
so when the school runs out of money,

04:37.377 --> 04:38.510
they cancel it.

04:38.511 --> 04:40.312
[Sighs]

04:40.313 --> 04:42.347
And, hey, you'll get to see me in action.

04:42.348 --> 04:43.816
I plan to infiltrate a friend group.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.818
Just keeps getting better.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.620
At least I wasn't the only one
having a crappy Saturday.

04:48.621 --> 04:49.888
For the past year,

04:49.889 --> 04:51.423
whenever big Mike was out of the house,

04:51.424 --> 04:52.825
Rusty would call Mike to come over

04:52.826 --> 04:55.294
and secretly weed out the junk.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.328
Oh, good, you got a head start.

04:56.329 --> 04:57.329
Oh, no.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.465
Just catching up on my news. [Chuckles]

04:59.466 --> 05:01.266
Reagan died.

05:01.267 --> 05:02.434
Rusty, we got to move here.

05:02.435 --> 05:03.702
We don't know when dad's coming back.

05:03.703 --> 05:05.270
Oh, no worries.

05:05.271 --> 05:08.273
I already got rid of a C.B.
radio and five microwaves.

05:08.274 --> 05:09.775
Whoa. Don't throw out
too much of one thing,

05:09.776 --> 05:10.843
or he'll notice.

05:10.844 --> 05:11.944
Remember... we're just thinning.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.479
Oh, I didn't do it yet.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.648
No, I just put post-its on
them so you could do it.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.650
Not really post-its.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.520
Actually, just... just little
pieces of toilet paper.

05:21.521 --> 05:23.490
Okay.

05:25.024 --> 05:26.592
[Knock on door]

05:26.593 --> 05:28.527
You're here! Whoo!

05:28.528 --> 05:30.796
I'm glad you made it safe!
I was worried about you!

05:30.797 --> 05:31.930
- [Door closes]
- You were?

05:31.931 --> 05:34.500
Oh, come here, you! [Grunts]

05:34.501 --> 05:37.302
We're gonna have so much fun!

05:37.303 --> 05:38.905
[Chuckling] Aah! Unh!

05:41.375 --> 05:42.876
So, we were off to the robotics exhibit.

05:42.877 --> 05:45.768
Operation infiltration was on.

[Indistinct conversations]

06:14.940 --> 06:17.162
Hey, guys, plenty of room over here.

06:17.163 --> 06:18.454
It's okay. I'm fine.

06:18.455 --> 06:20.694
Oh, really? 'Cause you
look kind of squished.

06:20.695 --> 06:22.359
I don't know why you'd want to be squished.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.470
It's a long trip.

06:23.471 --> 06:25.183
There are certain safety regulations,

06:25.184 --> 06:27.103
so maybe you should just move over here.

06:27.104 --> 06:28.583
Parker: I don't want to.

06:28.584 --> 06:30.775
Hi. I'm Parker's mom. Is everything okay?

06:30.776 --> 06:33.158
Oh, yeah, it's just
they're kind of squished,

06:33.159 --> 06:34.374
and this seat is open,

06:34.375 --> 06:36.070
so I thought Parker could
just scooch on over.

06:36.071 --> 06:38.070
Oh, they're good. He's with his friends.

06:38.071 --> 06:39.518
Well, he can still talk to his friends.

06:39.519 --> 06:41.455
It's not like he can't see them. [Laughs]

06:41.456 --> 06:43.399
"Oh, I'm two feet away.
Where are my friends?"

06:43.400 --> 06:44.526
[Both laugh]

06:44.527 --> 06:46.597
Oh, I don't want him up and
around when the bus is moving.

06:46.598 --> 06:48.855
It'll just take a second.

06:48.856 --> 06:51.046
We can scooch my man Parker on over,

06:51.047 --> 06:53.902
and then we can all sit and
be safe and good and great.

06:53.903 --> 06:56.214
Let's just let it go. They're fine.

06:56.215 --> 06:57.726
Driver, we're good.

06:57.727 --> 07:00.656
[Engine turns over]

07:03.415 --> 07:05.006
Hey, I'm making my own vitamins now.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.015
You want in?

07:06.016 --> 07:07.862
Isn't that a big undertaking?

07:07.863 --> 07:10.239
No, not if you don't involve the FDA.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.182
All they do is dilute the potency.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.132
They don't want you living a long time.

07:15.133 --> 07:17.668
They made the ebola to guard area 51.

07:18.843 --> 07:21.747
We got all our cash tied up in
food and shelter right now.

07:21.748 --> 07:23.955
But if something changes,
I'll let you know.

07:23.956 --> 07:25.084
[Hands clap]

07:27.715 --> 07:29.971
Wow. Our old room!

07:29.972 --> 07:33.274
He hasn't changed anything
from when we were growing up.

07:33.275 --> 07:36.626
All this time I've been
staying in the tire room,

07:36.627 --> 07:38.352
I could have been living here.

07:38.353 --> 07:39.544
My dirt!

07:39.545 --> 07:40.977
[Laughs]

07:40.978 --> 07:43.625
Ah, you remember when pet rocks took off?

07:43.626 --> 07:46.913
Ah. I thought pet dirt
would be right behind it.

07:46.914 --> 07:49.753
That's seven years of my
life I'd like to get back.

07:53.737 --> 07:55.408
There she is!

07:55.409 --> 07:56.745
Oh, man.

07:56.746 --> 07:59.592
That's when pointies meant something.

07:59.593 --> 08:01.681
Ha. Now you see them everywhere.

08:04.529 --> 08:06.705
Hey! Hey, Mike, look at this.

08:07.871 --> 08:09.070
[Chuckles]

08:09.071 --> 08:10.542
We should finish our game.

08:10.543 --> 08:13.014
What? No. We're not here to goof around.

08:13.015 --> 08:15.115
We're here to trick dad
and sneak out his stuff.

08:15.116 --> 08:17.371
Well, that makes sense you
wouldn't want to finish

08:17.372 --> 08:19.123
because I was winning.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.067
You weren't winning. I had more countries.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.916
Yeah, but I had just rolled a 6.

08:22.917 --> 08:24.499
I was about to take over Asia.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.604
Wait. Wait. I remember now.

08:26.605 --> 08:28.062
You rolled a 6 off the board.

08:28.063 --> 08:29.315
- It doesn't count.
- Does.

08:29.316 --> 08:30.318
- Doesn't.
- Does.

08:30.319 --> 08:31.785
Just 'cause you keep saying
"does" doesn't make it true.

08:31.786 --> 08:34.361
Well, no, being true makes it true.

08:34.361 --> 08:38.273
Fine. I'll let you roll
again, see what you get.

08:38.274 --> 08:39.326
Okay.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.890
[Laughter]

08:48.054 --> 08:49.691
All right, Axl, what is going on?

08:49.692 --> 08:51.849
- What? Nothing.
- Oh, please!

08:51.850 --> 08:53.873
You didn't shoot any straws
at me at the restaurant.

08:53.874 --> 08:55.061
You didn't lick my bread

08:55.062 --> 08:56.153
and then put it back on my plate.

08:56.154 --> 08:58.547
The whole day, you have
been calling me "Sue."

08:58.548 --> 09:01.286
Look, there's nothing going on, hmm?

09:01.287 --> 09:03.661
The thing is, maybe it's
you getting into college,

09:03.662 --> 09:05.061
maybe it's you getting your braces off

09:05.062 --> 09:06.205
after four million years,

09:06.206 --> 09:07.989
but you're not the same dork you were.

09:07.990 --> 09:10.045
So I'm trying to treat you the way

09:10.046 --> 09:11.813
you said you always wanted me to treat you.

09:11.814 --> 09:13.557
Unless, of course,

09:13.558 --> 09:15.780
now you're saying you don't want me to.

09:15.781 --> 09:17.357
What? No. No, no, no.

09:17.358 --> 09:22.156
If you mean it... that's great.

09:22.157 --> 09:24.487
It's like a dream come true.

09:24.488 --> 09:28.021
Sue couldn't believe her new
relationship with her brother.

09:29.606 --> 09:31.909
But then Axl made one fatal error.

09:31.910 --> 09:35.797
He kissed her for the
first time in his life.

09:35.798 --> 09:39.437
Calling her by her actual name
was one thing, but a kiss?

09:39.438 --> 09:41.205
She knew he was up to something.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.913
I love that you two are so close.

09:43.914 --> 09:44.968
Yeah.

09:44.969 --> 09:47.104
Well... you do for family.

09:47.105 --> 09:49.552
And there it was.

09:49.553 --> 09:51.376
[Game piece clatters]

09:51.377 --> 09:53.653
Welcome to my empire, Yakutsk.

09:53.654 --> 09:56.149
Rusty, you know what? You're right.
This is fun.

09:56.150 --> 09:57.238
Oh, sure.

09:57.239 --> 10:00.253
Yeah, you got to relive the old days
while you have the chance.

10:00.254 --> 10:02.190
Like, remember when we were little?

10:02.191 --> 10:03.494
Remember that one time?

10:03.495 --> 10:06.910
You pretended to be dead. [Chuckles]

10:06.911 --> 10:08.117
And I cried. [Chuckles]

10:08.118 --> 10:11.310
And you still pretended to
be dead, so I cried more.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.686
And then you laughed and called me a moron

10:13.687 --> 10:16.733
and tickled me till peed
myself [Chuckles] and I cried.

10:16.734 --> 10:18.478
What? I never did that.

10:18.479 --> 10:19.606
Sure you did.

10:19.607 --> 10:21.454
You used to do that stuff
to me all the time.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.926
Ah, you don't know what
you're talking about.

10:22.927 --> 10:24.622
Like what kind of stuff?

10:24.623 --> 10:27.421
Well, you told me Jesus didn't love me.

10:27.422 --> 10:30.510
That one hurt because all
the kids at Sunday school

10:30.511 --> 10:32.733
always said, "Jesus loves me."

10:32.734 --> 10:36.366
So I thought, "man, this
Jesus guy loves everybody.

10:36.367 --> 10:37.774
What's his beef with me?"

10:37.775 --> 10:40.190
Wow. Rusty, I'm sorry.

10:40.191 --> 10:41.398
There was this one time

10:41.399 --> 10:42.814
you locked me in the closet all night.

10:42.815 --> 10:45.702
And I cried, and you said
if I didn't stop crying,

10:45.703 --> 10:48.440
then Bobby Sherman would kill our mom.

10:48.441 --> 10:51.228
- Bobby Sherman the singer?
- Yeah.

10:51.229 --> 10:53.235
Why would you believe that
Bobby Sherman the singer

10:53.236 --> 10:54.437
was gonna kill mom?

10:54.438 --> 10:56.220
Because I believed everything you told me.

10:56.221 --> 10:57.876
Like, remember in high school?

10:57.877 --> 10:59.692
I wanted to be a meteorologist,

10:59.693 --> 11:02.452
but you told me my body would look womanly

11:02.453 --> 11:03.605
against the weather map.

11:03.606 --> 11:06.829
That's when I got into
the old pet-dirt biz.

11:07.254 --> 11:09.915
And we all know how that worked out.

11:12.331 --> 11:15.514
Wow, Sue [Chuckles] you were right.

11:15.515 --> 11:17.938
"You've got mail" is a great rom-com.

11:17.939 --> 11:20.473
I don't know how I've gone
this long without seeing it.

11:20.474 --> 11:23.225
Did you get how Meg Ryan was
falling in love with Tom Hanks

11:23.226 --> 11:25.057
without realizing that he was the one

11:25.058 --> 11:26.274
running her out of business?

11:26.275 --> 11:27.393
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

11:27.394 --> 11:29.847
That was super clear. Yeah. [Grunts]

11:29.848 --> 11:31.897
Well, Devin and I are heading out.

11:31.898 --> 11:34.617
There are cleanish towels in the bathroom.

11:34.618 --> 11:35.865
And I'll see you in the morning.

11:35.866 --> 11:37.844
- Where are you guys going?
- Devin: A party.

11:37.845 --> 11:39.489
We'd invite you, but, uh,

11:39.490 --> 11:40.809
you got that orientation
thing in the morning.

11:40.810 --> 11:42.145
Mnh. [Chuckles]

11:42.146 --> 11:44.177
Sue figured she had two choices...

11:44.178 --> 11:47.034
Get mad that Axl was
pretending to be nice to her

11:47.035 --> 11:48.048
just to impress Devin

11:48.049 --> 11:49.896
or get even.

11:49.897 --> 11:52.824
Actually, I would love
to meet all your friends

11:52.825 --> 11:55.942
and tell them how we're gonna be
East Indy Twinsies next year!

11:55.943 --> 11:57.328
Guess which one she picked.

11:58.987 --> 12:01.464
Okay, never thought I'd
be at a robotics exhibit

12:01.465 --> 12:03.943
with a bunch of middle-schoolers
on a Saturday night,

12:03.944 --> 12:05.302
but here we are.

12:05.303 --> 12:06.574
Life's a journey.

12:06.575 --> 12:08.127
No flash photography.

12:12.207 --> 12:15.117
Don't say anything. Don't
say anything, Frankie.

12:15.118 --> 12:16.990
Don't say anything.

12:16.991 --> 12:18.749
Excuse me. I just have to say one thing.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.805
You know, you said the kids were fine,

12:20.806 --> 12:23.409
but the truth is, your kid was fine.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.521
My kid was not fine.

12:24.522 --> 12:27.705
My kid sat by himself for
the whole two-hour ride,

12:27.706 --> 12:29.785
so maybe it would have been a little finer

12:29.786 --> 12:32.081
if you had told your kid
to sit next to my kid

12:32.082 --> 12:33.809
because 13-year-old boys are horrible.

12:33.810 --> 12:35.281
You can't just let them
make their own decisions.

12:35.282 --> 12:36.617
If it was up to them,

12:36.618 --> 12:37.769
they would have ice cream for breakfast.

12:37.770 --> 12:39.825
But we don't give them ice
cream for breakfast, right?

12:39.826 --> 12:41.457
[Stammers] I don't.

12:41.458 --> 12:43.066
I mean, I have, if it's their birthday

12:43.067 --> 12:45.514
or we're out of milk, but not usually.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.042
The point is, you're teaching your kid

12:47.043 --> 12:49.218
to just look out for number one,

12:49.219 --> 12:51.610
and now he's gonna grow up to run companies

12:51.611 --> 12:52.954
and wreck wall street!

12:52.955 --> 12:55.247
Now, do you know if we keep
the 3D glasses or not?

12:55.248 --> 12:56.712
Ugh, forget it! I'll ask somebody else!

13:00.488 --> 13:01.719
[Sighs]

13:05.810 --> 13:06.831
Hey, mom.

13:06.832 --> 13:09.047
Looks like somebody had an appointment

13:09.048 --> 13:11.431
at the angry salon for a "mad-icure."

13:11.432 --> 13:12.903
[Sighs] You heard that, huh?

13:12.904 --> 13:14.929
Well [Stammers] I was right.

13:14.930 --> 13:17.273
I-I have the blood of righteousness

13:17.274 --> 13:18.522
coursing through my veins.

13:18.523 --> 13:21.386
Mm, this might be more
about you than Brick.

13:21.387 --> 13:23.362
He's having a great time.

13:23.363 --> 13:25.618
I mean, even if he was
bothered by what happened,

13:25.619 --> 13:27.706
he has a good coping mechanism.

13:27.707 --> 13:30.418
We all need coping mechanisms.

13:30.419 --> 13:33.281
Like, I was upset that Shelly
was getting married today...

13:33.282 --> 13:36.138
But now I'm not even thinking about her.

13:36.139 --> 13:38.418
It's almost like she's begging me

13:38.419 --> 13:39.465
to interrupt the wedding.

13:39.466 --> 13:43.872
[Sighs] It's just, being
a parent to Brick is hard.

13:43.873 --> 13:44.942
It's just so hard.

13:44.943 --> 13:46.695
And, I mean, I was spoiled

13:46.696 --> 13:49.893
because, with Axl, it was all so easy.

13:49.894 --> 13:51.238
He always had friends.

13:51.239 --> 13:54.165
Way to blow that wide-open lay-up, dude.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.646
I totally saved you with
that sick three from...

13:55.647 --> 13:57.530
Hey, do they want to ride with Brandon?

13:57.531 --> 13:58.965
He's got room in his car. He...

13:58.966 --> 14:00.613
Oh, they're fine. Good game. Bye!

14:00.614 --> 14:03.540
Oh, my God.

14:03.541 --> 14:05.972
I did it, too.

14:05.973 --> 14:09.012
I was one of the "they're fine" moms.

14:09.013 --> 14:10.092
Ugh. See?

14:10.093 --> 14:12.357
This is why I don't sign
up for field trips.

14:12.358 --> 14:13.829
Well, you can't beat yourself up.

14:13.830 --> 14:14.908
We all make mistakes.

14:14.909 --> 14:17.861
The important thing is to
learn from them and move on.

14:19.172 --> 14:20.473
Seriously, though, the wedding's

14:20.474 --> 14:22.652
over at the first Baptist
Church on Elm Street.

14:22.653 --> 14:23.729
Should I do it?

14:25.773 --> 14:26.908
Ah.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.297
I lost again.

14:29.298 --> 14:32.269
Hey, I should bring my duffel bag up here.

14:32.270 --> 14:33.273
[Chuckles]

14:33.274 --> 14:34.927
Now, when I'm at a bar,

14:34.928 --> 14:38.127
I won't have to ask women to
go back to the tire room.

14:38.128 --> 14:41.448
Now I can ask them to come
back to my boyhood room.

14:41.449 --> 14:43.031
And if they think that's weird,

14:43.032 --> 14:46.016
I'll just tell them, "it's okay.
My mom's dead."

14:46.017 --> 14:47.407
[Chuckles]

14:48.888 --> 14:51.255
Hey, Rusty, do you ever think that, uh,

14:51.256 --> 14:53.828
you know, the way I treated
you when we were growing up

14:53.829 --> 14:55.008
is maybe the reason...

14:55.968 --> 14:59.295
Why you are, you know, the way you are?

14:59.296 --> 15:00.760
How am I?

15:00.761 --> 15:02.747
- Well, great.
- Oh, thank you.

15:02.748 --> 15:06.371
I just mean y-your life is
a little unconventional.

15:06.372 --> 15:07.922
You live here. You don't own a home.

15:07.923 --> 15:09.891
Yeah, no mortgage to pay.

15:09.892 --> 15:11.740
That's got to weigh on you, huh?

15:13.124 --> 15:16.755
Well, I mean, y-you don't
have much stability.

15:16.756 --> 15:17.835
You don't have a steady job.

15:17.836 --> 15:19.822
You don't have a serious relationship.

15:19.823 --> 15:20.857
Right.

15:20.858 --> 15:23.964
And you got to go home to
that short, angry lady, huh?

15:23.965 --> 15:25.347
I don't think you get what I'm saying here.

15:25.348 --> 15:30.211
There's something fulfilling
about raising a family.

15:30.212 --> 15:33.003
Yeah, but I don't have to worry

15:33.004 --> 15:35.108
about getting three girls into college.

15:36.956 --> 15:38.101
Neither do I.

15:38.102 --> 15:40.131
That's a great attitude, Mike. [Chuckles]

15:40.132 --> 15:43.435
If they really want it,
they'll work for it.

15:43.436 --> 15:44.611
Ah.

15:44.612 --> 15:46.563
Listen, I know you've...

15:46.564 --> 15:49.264
You've made some bad choices
in life, and, uh...

15:49.265 --> 15:51.004
- [Scoffs]
- I feel for you, buddy.

15:51.005 --> 15:54.535
Hey, you want me to take you
out and buy you a beer?

15:54.536 --> 15:56.047
I won't be buying.

15:56.048 --> 15:57.408
I'm just using that as an expression.

16:00.264 --> 16:02.583
Can't. Got to get home.

16:02.584 --> 16:04.759
You know, the short, angry lady and all.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.728
- [Sighs]
- Yeah.

16:06.729 --> 16:10.034
[Upbeat music playing]

16:10.035 --> 16:12.036
[Sighs] Hey, what's up, bro?

16:12.037 --> 16:13.038
Oh, hey.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.140
By the way, Sue, very cute hoodie.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.842
[Chuckling] Oh, thanks!

16:17.843 --> 16:19.978
Axl, do you think my hoodie is cute?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.112
Yeah. It's cute.

16:21.113 --> 16:23.181
Aww. What else about me
do you think is cute?

16:23.182 --> 16:24.716
Everything. Everything is cute.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.651
- Oh!
- This party's dead. Let's go.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.019
Ooh! I love this song!

16:28.020 --> 16:29.921
Come on, Axl. Dance with me.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.556
Nobody else is dancing.

16:31.557 --> 16:34.192
Ooh! Well, someone's got to start.

16:34.193 --> 16:37.662
Who better than a loving
brother and sister?

16:37.663 --> 16:38.930
You don't mind, do you, Devin?

16:38.931 --> 16:41.499
No. Go for it. I'm gonna get a drink.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.601
Okay.

16:43.602 --> 16:45.603
[Humming] I know what you're up to.

16:45.604 --> 16:47.605
Oh, yeah? Well, I know what you're up to.

16:47.606 --> 16:50.508
So, if I were you, I would
start voguing real fast.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.876
Or what?

16:51.877 --> 16:54.779
Or I tell Devin every mean thing
you've ever done to me...

16:54.780 --> 16:56.814
How you glued my toothpaste to my hand,

16:56.815 --> 16:59.183
how you glued your dirty
underwear to my head,

16:59.184 --> 17:00.585
every glue story!

17:00.586 --> 17:02.053
And I'll tell her about the farting,

17:02.054 --> 17:06.124
yeah, all the farting,
every day for 18 years,

17:06.125 --> 17:08.059
19 if you count the times that
you farted on mom's stomach

17:08.060 --> 17:09.560
when she was pregnant with me, which I do.

17:09.560 --> 17:10.627
Twirl me!

17:10.628 --> 17:12.063
You can't tell her any of that stuff.

17:12.064 --> 17:13.131
Bro code!

17:13.132 --> 17:15.815
Oh, I am not a bro. I am a "so."

17:15.816 --> 17:17.502
I am a sis!

17:17.502 --> 17:19.137
I am your worst nightmare is what I am.

17:19.137 --> 17:21.939
So you're gonna be nice to me,
and you're gonna like it,

17:21.940 --> 17:24.776
or I will burn this thing down.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.176
So, here's how it's gonna go down.

17:26.178 --> 17:27.612
When we go back to your place,

17:27.613 --> 17:29.580
you and I are going to
cuddle under a blanket

17:29.581 --> 17:31.482
on the couch and take a picture of it,

17:31.483 --> 17:34.585
like I have been begging you
to do since Christmas 2007.

17:34.586 --> 17:37.055
I am going to put that
picture on a photo blanket

17:37.056 --> 17:38.656
and we'll take a picture of that

17:38.657 --> 17:40.058
and then we'll keep going

17:40.059 --> 17:42.527
until we're cuddling under
photo blankets into infinity!

17:42.528 --> 17:44.062
You're the devil!

17:44.063 --> 17:46.130
Oh, well, just so you know,
she's watching right now.

17:46.131 --> 17:48.599
[Music continues]

17:48.600 --> 17:50.636
[Finger snaps]

17:53.707 --> 17:56.779
Oh, hey. Wait up. No, no, no.

17:56.780 --> 17:57.996
Uh, uh, uh, don't be afraid.
[Chuckles nervously]

17:57.997 --> 18:00.412
I-I-I'm done with that. I-I'm sorry.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.092
I overreacted.

18:02.093 --> 18:04.424
Kids are gonna sit where they sit.
They're 13.

18:04.425 --> 18:05.745
You can't make them do what
they don't want to do.

18:05.746 --> 18:07.879
That's okay. I...

18:07.880 --> 18:08.887
No, no, no, no.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.464
You were just looking out for
your kid, and I get that.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.624
I have a cool kid, too... my oldest.

18:13.625 --> 18:14.976
Not that I don't love this one.

18:14.977 --> 18:16.385
I do. [Laughs nervously]

18:16.386 --> 18:19.761
Anyway... I'm sorry.

18:19.762 --> 18:21.074
[Sighs]

18:23.387 --> 18:26.314
Oh, what fun! [Giggles]

18:27.544 --> 18:31.159
Oh, Axl, I need the numbers
of everyone I met tonight.

18:31.160 --> 18:32.431
That way, I can text them.

18:32.432 --> 18:34.751
Fine. Whatever. I'm going to bed.

18:34.752 --> 18:35.986
[Switch clicks]

18:35.987 --> 18:39.991
Mm. Oh, oh, Axl, uh, cuddle picture.

18:39.992 --> 18:41.368

Aah! That's it! I'm done!

19:09.278 --> 19:11.185
Brothers and sisters should
not love each other!

19:11.186 --> 19:12.186
It's unnatural!

19:12.187 --> 19:14.303
We're not supposed to get close
till mom and dad start dying!

19:14.304 --> 19:16.076
He's a fraud, Devin!

19:16.077 --> 19:18.039
He's done a lot of bad
things to me with glue.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.477
He's been playing you!

19:19.478 --> 19:21.515
Actually, I've been playing him.

19:21.516 --> 19:24.913
Axl, all that crap about it
being super important to me

19:24.914 --> 19:27.075
that you get along with your sister...
not so much.

19:27.076 --> 19:29.351
April fools', sucka.

19:29.352 --> 19:32.339
[Gasps] You made me kiss my sister's head.

19:32.340 --> 19:34.555
Yeah. That was awesome.
Did not see that coming.

19:34.556 --> 19:37.212
Sorry, Sue. I didn't mean
to make you my pawn.

19:37.213 --> 19:39.625
[Scoffs] Are you kidding? It was great.

19:39.626 --> 19:41.559
He kissed me on the head

19:41.560 --> 19:42.802
and he cuddled me

19:42.803 --> 19:44.985
and I have pictures to prove it.

19:44.986 --> 19:46.285
[Chuckles]

19:46.286 --> 19:47.778
Oh! Sean Donahue liked it.

19:49.321 --> 19:51.267
Yep, no matter how you got there,

19:51.268 --> 19:52.587
your brother being nice to you

19:52.588 --> 19:54.332
is your brother being nice to you.

19:56.428 --> 19:57.495
[Vehicle approaching]

19:57.496 --> 19:58.529
Oh, no, that's dad.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.465
And there's 15 microwaves on the curb.

20:00.466 --> 20:02.266
He told me never to touch his stuff.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.402
He's gonna kick me out...

20:04.403 --> 20:06.671
Just when I got my bitchin' room back.

20:06.672 --> 20:07.739
Go out the window.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.008
You were gone all day. I'll take the hit.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.343
[Chuckles]

20:14.947 --> 20:16.714
Hey, thanks, Mike.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.884
You're a great brother.

20:20.586 --> 20:22.453
You got to love April fools' day.

20:22.454 --> 20:24.055
You never know what... or who...

20:24.056 --> 20:26.024
Is gonna take you by surprise.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.592
I want you to sit over here.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.394
Parker: What? Why?

20:29.395 --> 20:32.063
It's crowded where you are.
Just move over here, please.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.800
But Dante and I were... Parker, now.

20:40.305 --> 20:42.374
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:49.548 --> 20:52.016
At the end of the day, it's nice to know

20:52.017 --> 20:54.419
that, as moms, we all share a bond.

20:54.420 --> 20:57.455
We're all joined together
in one, big club where...

20:57.456 --> 20:59.724
Brick, what are you doing here?

20:59.725 --> 21:01.426
Eh, I'm done.

21:01.427 --> 21:02.827
I sat with him for a whole minute.

21:02.828 --> 21:04.762
I figured I should go out on a high.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.030
I left in the middle of a sentence

21:06.031 --> 21:07.799
so we wouldn't have any awkward silences.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.268
There's nothing awkward about that.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.470
Oh, and I left my lunch
box back at the museum.

21:12.471 --> 21:13.671
[Sighs]

21:13.672 --> 21:14.972
April fools'!

21:14.973 --> 21:15.973
I didn't.

21:15.974 --> 21:17.842
It was my sweatshirt.

21:17.843 --> 21:19.343
April fools'!

21:19.344 --> 21:21.612
It was my lunch box and my sweatshirt.
