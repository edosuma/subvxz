05:21.655 --> 05:23.198
Problem solved? Woof-woof?

05:23.240 --> 05:24.407
Nope. Headquarters

05:23.240 --> 05:24.407
won't allow it

05:24.449 --> 05:25.700
due to budgetary reasons.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.744
OK, OK, OK, OK.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.830
You know, Captain Holt was

05:27.786 --> 05:29.830
writing an instruction manual

05:29.871 --> 05:31.790
for his replacement in case

05:29.871 --> 05:31.790
he was named commissioner.

05:31.832 --> 05:32.916
Maybe he could tell you

05:31.832 --> 05:32.916
what to do.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.417
That's not necessary.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.544
Top Dog Terry can make

05:34.459 --> 05:36.544
a decision.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.712
And what would that be?

05:40.048 --> 05:43.177
Does Top Dog Terry want

05:40.048 --> 05:43.177
a moment to think about it?

05:43.218 --> 05:45.095
Woof-woof.

05:45.137 --> 05:47.306
[Ray] Since the rejection,

05:45.137 --> 05:47.306
a great sadness has

05:45.137 --> 05:47.306
enveloped me.

05:47.346 --> 05:49.348
I kept expecting this

05:47.346 --> 05:49.348
dark feeling to pass,

05:49.390 --> 05:50.684
but it's only gotten worse.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.519
Not getting the job

05:50.725 --> 05:52.519
you want stinks.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.813
In first grade, I was passed

05:52.560 --> 05:54.813
over for line leader,

05:54.855 --> 05:56.564
and I'm still pissed.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.318
Kyle D.'s lines had curves

05:56.606 --> 05:59.318
and gaps and cutting galore.

05:59.358 --> 06:00.652
It was a frickin' carnival.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.321
Yeah. What's

06:00.694 --> 06:02.321
a line leader?

06:02.361 --> 06:03.822
Well, it's not just that

06:02.361 --> 06:03.822
I didn't get the job.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.240
It's that John Kelly did.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.450
He's already released

06:05.282 --> 06:07.450
a memo detailing his

06:07.492 --> 06:09.244
"vigilant policing"

06:07.492 --> 06:09.244
initiative.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.121
It's essentially a return

06:09.286 --> 06:11.121
to stop and frisk.

06:11.163 --> 06:14.749
Choosing him is a betrayal

06:11.163 --> 06:14.749
of everything I stand for.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.626
I feel the same way

06:14.791 --> 06:16.626
about Kyle D.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.503
I tried to suck it up

06:16.668 --> 06:18.503
and go back to work.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.214
I put on my uniform

06:18.545 --> 06:20.214
and got in my car.

06:20.255 --> 06:23.633
And next thing I knew,

06:20.255 --> 06:23.633
I was on a plane to Mexico.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.426
I didn't even pack a bag.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.554
I bought a bundle of novelty

06:25.468 --> 06:27.554
shirts at a nearby gift shop.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.388
This one says,

06:27.595 --> 06:29.388
"What's up, beaches?"

06:29.430 --> 06:31.808
Instead of "bitches"

06:29.430 --> 06:31.808
for humor reasons.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.019
-But you hate humor.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.019
-Well, I'm a joke now,

06:34.061 --> 06:35.729
so it suits me.

06:35.770 --> 06:39.358
Mm-kay. But, how did

06:35.770 --> 06:39.358
you end up here in Mexico

06:39.398 --> 06:41.651
at the exact same

06:39.398 --> 06:41.651
tiny resort as us?

06:41.693 --> 06:43.653
Gina's been talking up

06:41.693 --> 06:43.653
this place up for years.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.572
[both]

06:43.695 --> 06:45.572
Referral Code GINA30.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.782
I had no idea you'd be here.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.617
You know what?

06:47.824 --> 06:49.617
It's fine, sir.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.161
A lot of people go on their

06:49.659 --> 06:51.161
honeymoon with their boss.

06:51.203 --> 06:52.579
Nope, I thought

06:51.203 --> 06:52.579
if I said it out loud

06:52.620 --> 06:53.830
it would normalize it,

06:52.620 --> 06:53.830
but it's weird.

06:53.872 --> 06:54.998
[Amy]

06:53.872 --> 06:54.998
It's gonna be OK.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.208
How long are you staying, sir?

06:56.250 --> 06:58.001
Just until

06:56.250 --> 06:58.001
I get my head right.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.295
But don't worry.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.295
I'll steer clear of you two.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.880
You won't even know I'm here.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.423
This place is so romantic.

07:04.465 --> 07:07.635
Yeah, and so...intimate.

07:07.677 --> 07:10.138
Don't worry.

07:07.677 --> 07:10.138
I'm not listening to you.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.849
I'm just thinking about

07:10.180 --> 07:12.849
how this sea bass is cold,

07:12.891 --> 07:15.185
but not as cold and cruel

07:12.891 --> 07:15.185
as the hands of fate

07:15.227 --> 07:19.773
that have thrust my entire life

07:15.227 --> 07:19.773
into darkness.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.233
Ah, damn it.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.151
I just ordered the sea bass.

07:25.528 --> 07:28.198
[Amy]

07:25.528 --> 07:28.198
Ahh, babe, this is so nice.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.075
There are hot stones

07:28.240 --> 07:30.075
on our butts for no reason.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.368
Not on mine.

07:31.410 --> 07:32.827
My butt stones

07:31.410 --> 07:32.827
keep falling off,

07:32.869 --> 07:33.995
because I'm so tense about

07:32.869 --> 07:33.995
Holt being here

07:34.037 --> 07:35.330
and ruining everything.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.125
-It hasn't been that bad.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.125
-Really?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.043
Oops. Sorry.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.795
Can't even float right.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.171
Just push me away.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.006
Everyone else does.

07:45.048 --> 07:48.593
It's not great, but as long

07:45.048 --> 07:48.593
as we stay in here, we're safe.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.345
Peralta, Santiago,

07:48.635 --> 07:50.345
I'm in your room.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.972
What? How?

07:52.013 --> 07:53.223
Patio door was open,

07:52.013 --> 07:53.223
I pushed through the hedge.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.016
Tell me,

07:53.265 --> 07:55.016
what is it about me

07:55.058 --> 07:56.726
that screams loser?

07:56.768 --> 07:58.437
Yeah, you know,

07:56.768 --> 07:58.437
we're kind of in the middle

07:58.478 --> 08:00.105
of getting massages

07:58.478 --> 08:00.105
right now, sir.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.564
Oh, how thoughtless of me.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.317
I'll get down here

08:01.606 --> 08:03.317
so you can see my face.

08:03.358 --> 08:04.818
Oh, no, that's...

08:04.859 --> 08:08.071
Hello. The question was,

08:04.859 --> 08:08.071
what is it about me

08:08.113 --> 08:11.658
that screams loser?

08:11.699 --> 08:14.535
I can't figure out what went

08:11.699 --> 08:14.535
wrong between our parents.

08:14.577 --> 08:15.954
They were so in love.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.538
Oh, OK, so we're having

08:15.996 --> 08:17.538
a conversation?

08:17.580 --> 08:19.124
No, to get them

08:17.580 --> 08:19.124
back together,

08:19.166 --> 08:20.250
we need to know what happened.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.250
Did your mom tell you?

08:20.292 --> 08:21.376
-Nope.

08:20.292 --> 08:21.376
-Damn it.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.003
OK, let's brainstorm.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.712
It could be that my dad is

08:23.044 --> 08:24.712
too clingy or too masculine.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.465
You know what? I'm going

08:24.754 --> 08:26.465
to play a game on my phone

08:26.506 --> 08:28.258
while you go

08:26.506 --> 08:28.258
on this little journey.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.760
He overshares,

08:28.300 --> 08:30.760
he's indecisive,

08:30.802 --> 08:32.137
he's always crying.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.221
Oh, I made it

08:32.179 --> 08:33.221
inside the temple.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.681
He wears a kimono a lot.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.266
I became a hawk.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.266
I have talons.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.476
Well, he can't keep a secret.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.227
He has

08:37.517 --> 08:39.227
a clinically loose pelvis.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.146
OK, that did break through.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.146
I heard "loose pelvis."

08:41.188 --> 08:42.314
Charles, you've got to stop.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.898
It's none of those things.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.400
Wait. You said your mom

08:43.940 --> 08:45.400
didn't tell you anything.

08:45.442 --> 08:46.860
-Do you know what happened?

08:45.442 --> 08:46.860
-Yes, I do.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.487
And it's none of your business,

08:46.901 --> 08:48.487
Charles.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.864
Just stop sticking your nose

08:48.528 --> 08:50.864
where it doesn't belong.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.532
Really, Gina.

08:52.573 --> 08:55.869
And where does my nose belong

08:52.573 --> 08:55.869
if not inside our parents?

08:55.910 --> 08:57.204
OK, so we can't get away

08:55.910 --> 08:57.204
from Holt.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.497
I mean, should

08:57.245 --> 08:58.497
we tell him to leave,

08:58.538 --> 08:59.622
that he's ruining

08:58.538 --> 08:59.622
our honeymoon?

08:59.664 --> 09:01.166
No, we can't.

09:01.208 --> 09:04.127
That would crush him,

09:01.208 --> 09:04.127
and he's already so crushed.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.586
Wait, I got it.

09:05.628 --> 09:06.587
We kill Holt.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.173
No.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.883
No, that was crazy

09:08.215 --> 09:09.883
for a multitude of reasons.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.801
We have a bunch of fun

09:09.924 --> 09:11.801
activities planned.

09:11.843 --> 09:15.096
If we include him, it'll cheer

09:11.843 --> 09:15.096
him up, and he'll leave.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.391
Right, but aren't most

09:15.138 --> 09:17.391
of our activities

09:17.432 --> 09:19.017
kind of geared towards couples?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.269
Name one couples' activity

09:19.059 --> 09:21.269
that wouldn't be more fun

09:21.311 --> 09:22.562
with your boss there.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.314
Welcome to Sensual Food

09:22.603 --> 09:24.314
Tasting:

09:24.356 --> 09:26.441
The Art of Feeding Your Lover.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.109
I feel like I don't

09:26.483 --> 09:28.109
belong here.

09:28.151 --> 09:31.530
Mm, I love the way the mud

09:28.151 --> 09:31.530
revitalizes your skin.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.115
And I love how it

09:31.571 --> 09:34.115
masks my shame.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.825
I am loving this.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.952
-Mmm.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.496
Mmm.

09:39.538 --> 09:41.206
This is actually

09:39.538 --> 09:41.206
quite pleasant.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.542
You know, when you invited me

09:41.248 --> 09:43.542
to join you today,

09:43.583 --> 09:44.709
I was skeptical.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.461
I had been sitting

09:44.751 --> 09:46.461
by the pool

09:46.503 --> 09:49.423
contentedly watching a bee

09:46.503 --> 09:49.423
struggle to avoid drowning

09:49.464 --> 09:52.050
and thinking to myself

09:49.464 --> 09:52.050
how I am like that bee.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.343
Man, I hope it survived.

09:53.385 --> 09:54.886
We can't afford to lose

09:53.385 --> 09:54.886
any more bees.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.430
It didn't.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.430
The point is that I am glad

09:56.471 --> 09:58.056
you included me

09:56.471 --> 09:58.056
into your frivolous activities.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.891
You helped me to remember

09:58.098 --> 09:59.891
there's more to life

09:59.933 --> 10:01.101
than the NYPD.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.395
Wow, that's

10:01.142 --> 10:03.395
great to hear, sir.

10:03.437 --> 10:04.563
I feel a lot better.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.147
I think I may be heading home.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.108
Unless you need a third

10:06.189 --> 10:08.108
for tonight's activities.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.609
-What are we...

10:08.149 --> 10:09.609
-Sensual pottery.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.361
I think we're good.

10:11.403 --> 10:13.071
Sarge, I keep getting calls

10:11.403 --> 10:13.071
about my drug case from--

10:13.113 --> 10:14.489
What the hell is going on?

10:14.531 --> 10:16.533
Nothing. Just deciding

10:14.531 --> 10:16.533
what to do about

10:16.575 --> 10:19.160
your sanitation issue,

10:16.575 --> 10:19.160
like a boss.

10:19.202 --> 10:20.537
You're looking for Captain

10:19.202 --> 10:20.537
Holt's manual aren't you?

10:20.579 --> 10:22.330
Please, Diaz.

10:22.372 --> 10:25.125
Top Dog Terry does not need to

10:22.372 --> 10:25.125
look for Captain Holt's manual.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.667
He knows it's on his computer.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.211
Top Dog Terry was

10:26.709 --> 10:28.211
looking for the password.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.255
Why don't you just

10:28.253 --> 10:30.255
make your own decision?

10:30.297 --> 10:32.632
I did that,

10:30.297 --> 10:32.632
and I'm very proud of it.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.217
I just want to make sure

10:32.673 --> 10:34.217
Captain Holt would make

10:34.259 --> 10:36.386
the same decision

10:34.259 --> 10:36.386
so I can be proud of him too.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.679
Gina. Do you know

10:36.428 --> 10:38.679
Captain Holt's password?

10:38.721 --> 10:41.141
Oh, Terry, just because

10:38.721 --> 10:41.141
I know all your passwords

10:41.182 --> 10:43.059
doesn't mean I know

10:41.182 --> 10:43.059
Captain Holt's.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.561
OK, well,

10:43.101 --> 10:44.561
we could probably guess it.

10:44.603 --> 10:47.314
Why don't you try

10:44.603 --> 10:47.314
BaldByChoice or PecMan

10:47.355 --> 10:49.399
or MacklemoreEnthusiast?

10:49.441 --> 10:52.277
Stop saying my passwords.

10:49.441 --> 10:52.277
Damn, Gina.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.694
Now Terry's got to update

10:52.319 --> 10:53.694
his keychain.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.572
Start simple. Kevin

10:53.736 --> 10:55.572
with a capital K

10:55.614 --> 10:56.823
and a 1 instead of an I

10:56.864 --> 10:58.241
Well, I feel good about that.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.204
Locked out?

11:00.827 --> 11:03.204
Too many failed attempts?

11:03.246 --> 11:05.290
I only guessed once!

11:05.332 --> 11:08.335
"Computer will now

11:05.332 --> 11:08.335
delete hard drive"?

11:08.376 --> 11:09.919
I've got to fix this.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.798
Good. You fixed it.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.342
He's leaving.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.342
Our plan worked.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.926
We saved our own honeymoon,

11:15.383 --> 11:16.926
and fun bonus,

11:16.968 --> 11:18.428
-we cheered up Holt.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.428
-Yes.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.971
OK, it's time to celebrate.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.389
You know what that means.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.475
This B needs a C in her A.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.101
Oh, my God.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.394
This babe needs

11:25.143 --> 11:26.394
a coconut in her arms.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.397
Oh, I thought you

11:26.436 --> 11:29.397
were saying

11:29.439 --> 11:30.898
this [bleep] needs a [bleep]

11:29.439 --> 11:30.898
in her [bleep].

11:30.940 --> 11:32.526
-Oh, my God.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.526
-Yeah, that was my reaction.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.110
All right, I'll go get us

11:32.567 --> 11:34.110
a couple of coconuts.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.820
Ahh, hey there, Captain.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.738
Haven't seen you looking

11:35.862 --> 11:37.738
this happy since they picked up

11:37.780 --> 11:39.533
"The Durrells in Corfu"

11:37.780 --> 11:39.533
for a fourth season.

11:39.574 --> 11:42.160
Yes, well, I've reached

11:39.574 --> 11:42.160
the best part of every vacation:

11:42.202 --> 11:43.702
reviewing the charges.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.038
Well, don't let me interrupt.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.038
Have a safe flight.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.789
And I'll see you back

11:45.079 --> 11:46.789
at the Nine-Nine.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.208
No, you won't; I'll never be

11:46.831 --> 11:48.208
going back there again.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.210
What? Why?

11:48.249 --> 11:50.210
I'm confused.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.629
You and Amy made me see

11:50.251 --> 11:52.629
that there's more to life

11:52.671 --> 11:56.299
than the NYPD, so I'm quitting.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.301
Oh.

11:58.343 --> 12:02.430
Well...

11:58.343 --> 12:02.430
what a satisfying result

12:02.472 --> 12:05.433
that we all were hoping

12:02.472 --> 12:05.433
would occur.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.897
Hold on. So let's

12:08.478 --> 12:10.897
just back up a second.

12:10.938 --> 12:12.524
When you say you're quitting,

12:10.938 --> 12:12.524
you mean quitting

12:12.566 --> 12:14.067
for, like, a couple of weeks,

12:12.566 --> 12:14.067
and then you'll come back

12:14.108 --> 12:15.318
Jordan-style with a new badge

12:14.108 --> 12:15.318
number?

12:15.360 --> 12:17.070
No, I mean, quitting

12:15.360 --> 12:17.070
permanently.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.072
I'm putting in my resignation

12:17.111 --> 12:19.072
as soon as I get back home.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.490
I better hurry if I want

12:19.113 --> 12:20.490
to be at the airport

12:20.532 --> 12:21.908
six hours ahead of my flight.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.077
Hey, you know what?

12:21.949 --> 12:24.077
I should drive you there.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.995
Will you come with me to grab

12:24.118 --> 12:25.995
my keys from the room?

12:26.037 --> 12:30.124
OK, they're

12:26.037 --> 12:30.124
just right in here, so...

12:32.377 --> 12:33.420
You're not leaving this room.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.713
What the hell is going on?

12:34.753 --> 12:36.172
I can't let you quit.

12:36.214 --> 12:39.467
Yes, but why the candles

12:36.214 --> 12:39.467
and rose petals?

12:39.509 --> 12:41.636
-Wuh-oh.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.636
-Is that Mr. McClane I hear?

12:41.678 --> 12:45.724
'Cause someone's about

12:41.678 --> 12:45.724
to Die Harrr-- Oh, my God!

12:45.764 --> 12:47.225
Why is Captain Holt here?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.976
Because he's gonna--

12:47.267 --> 12:48.976
Wait, are you dressed like

12:49.018 --> 12:50.144
Bonnie Bedelia in "Die Hard?"

12:50.186 --> 12:51.521
-I am.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.521
-For sexy reasons?

12:51.563 --> 12:53.356
-Yes.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.356
-Oh, boy.

12:53.398 --> 12:54.524
Jake, why is he here?

12:54.566 --> 12:56.025
Because he's

12:54.566 --> 12:56.025
quitting the force,

12:56.067 --> 12:57.569
so I brought him

12:56.067 --> 12:57.569
to convince him not to,

12:57.611 --> 12:59.070
but obviously

12:57.611 --> 12:59.070
that is not important anymore.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.863
All right, Captain,

12:59.112 --> 13:00.863
it's been a good run.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.490
Thank you for teaching me

13:00.905 --> 13:02.490
the importance of a tie

13:02.532 --> 13:03.908
in the workplace,

13:02.532 --> 13:03.908
and the door is right over here.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.452
Whoa, whoa, wait. What?

13:03.950 --> 13:05.452
You're quitting?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.203
-Yes, I am.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.203
-No, you're not.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.955
We're keeping you right here.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.415
How are you going to do that?

13:08.996 --> 13:10.415
Physically restrain me?

13:10.457 --> 13:11.874
Great idea.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.126
Is there anything in Charles'

13:11.916 --> 13:13.126
box of nightmares

13:13.167 --> 13:15.462
that could be used

13:13.167 --> 13:15.462
to tie up Holt?

13:15.503 --> 13:17.672
Yes. Literally everything

13:15.503 --> 13:17.672
in here could be used

13:17.714 --> 13:19.340
to tie up a person.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.718
Wow, Terry, put Captain

13:19.382 --> 13:21.718
Holt's computer back together?

13:21.760 --> 13:23.428
-Looks great.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.428
-Sure did.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.930
Couldn't find room inside

13:23.470 --> 13:25.930
for this stuff, though.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.724
Well, is there any chance

13:25.972 --> 13:27.724
the info on his computer

13:27.766 --> 13:29.225
was maybe saved to the cloud?

13:29.267 --> 13:31.018
I don't know.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.605
Gina, was Captain Holt's hard

13:31.060 --> 13:33.605
drive backed up to the cloud?

13:33.647 --> 13:35.356
-Yeah.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.356
-Then why did you let me try

13:35.398 --> 13:36.357
to rebuild his computer?

13:36.399 --> 13:38.067
Because I'm a rascal.

13:38.109 --> 13:41.738
OK, I'll just log

13:38.109 --> 13:41.738
onto the cloud as Captain Holt

13:41.780 --> 13:44.491
and click "forgot password"

13:44.532 --> 13:46.534
and answer his security

13:44.532 --> 13:46.534
questions.

13:46.576 --> 13:49.370
First up: What is God?

13:49.412 --> 13:50.955
<i>[Scully]</i>

13:49.412 --> 13:50.955
<i>Hey, Gina.</i>

13:50.997 --> 13:52.749
Did you see "Real Housewives"

13:50.997 --> 13:52.749
last night?

13:52.791 --> 13:55.293
If she says no,

13:52.791 --> 13:55.293
then ask about "Below Deck."

13:55.335 --> 13:56.753
What are you doing?

13:56.795 --> 13:58.296
She's getting suspicious,

13:56.795 --> 13:58.296
Scully. Act natural.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.964
Are you wearing an earpiece?

14:00.006 --> 14:01.882
Tell her no. Scully,

14:00.006 --> 14:01.882
stop saying what I'm saying.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.802
Be normal.

14:03.842 --> 14:04.927
Charles, what are you doing?

14:04.969 --> 14:06.137
Damn it, Gina.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.972
What does it

14:06.179 --> 14:07.972
look like I'm doing?

14:08.014 --> 14:09.808
I'm trying to unlock your phone

14:08.014 --> 14:09.808
using a mask of your face

14:09.848 --> 14:11.726
so I can find out

14:09.848 --> 14:11.726
why your mom left my dad.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.186
Charles, give me my phone.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.730
OK, fine.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.232
-Boom, unlocked it.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.232
-Give me my phone, Charles!

14:18.274 --> 14:20.234
Not until I find out

14:18.274 --> 14:20.234
why our parents are breaking up.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.944
-Give it.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.944
-Scrolling, scrolling.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.738
-Give me my phone, you idiot.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.738
-You were the reason.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.573
You sent her a text that says,

14:23.780 --> 14:25.573
"You should divorce him"?

14:25.615 --> 14:28.034
OK, yeah, but that's open

14:25.615 --> 14:28.034
to interpretation.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.619
No, but then she says,

14:28.075 --> 14:29.619
"I don't want to,"

14:29.661 --> 14:31.329
and then you say,

14:29.661 --> 14:31.329
"But you have to.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.955
"Leave him now,

14:31.371 --> 14:32.955
and divorce him.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.499
Don't tell him why."

14:34.541 --> 14:36.835
OK, yeah, you did

14:34.541 --> 14:36.835
interpret it correctly.

14:38.753 --> 14:41.005
Shame, shame.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.799
I'm so sorry

14:41.047 --> 14:42.799
I brought Holt back here.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.718
I had no idea you were doing

14:42.841 --> 14:44.718
this whole "Die Hard" thing.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.386
Man, you really got the hair

14:44.759 --> 14:46.386
exactly right.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.471
Did you contact the onset hair

14:46.427 --> 14:48.471
stylist, Paul Abascal?

14:48.513 --> 14:50.056
No, this is a wig.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.974
Oh, that's cool too.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.974
So here's what I'm thinking.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.852
We let Holt go, I have sex

14:52.016 --> 14:53.852
with Holly Gennaro but hotter.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.270
The squad handles the captain,

14:53.893 --> 14:56.270
or disbands, whatever,

14:56.312 --> 14:57.980
we have sex again--

14:58.022 --> 14:59.566
OK, stop suggesting that.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.566
We need to stay focused.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.067
-Right.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.067
-Holt is fragile.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.485
We need to be gentle, OK?

15:02.527 --> 15:03.986
-Just follow my lead.

15:02.527 --> 15:03.986
-With pleasure.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.530
I love the view.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.530
I'm sorry.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.741
This outfit is

15:05.572 --> 15:07.741
driving me insane.

15:07.782 --> 15:10.451
Hello, sir. Sorry again

15:07.782 --> 15:10.451
for tying you spread eagle

15:10.493 --> 15:13.079
-on the bed.

15:10.493 --> 15:13.079
-Apology not accepted.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.498
Look, I know you're upset,

15:13.120 --> 15:15.498
but this isn't

15:15.540 --> 15:17.542
your last chance

15:15.540 --> 15:17.542
to become commissioner.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.835
John Kelly's old.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.420
He's not gonna be

15:18.877 --> 15:20.420
in office forever.

15:20.461 --> 15:21.962
True, but he'll just

15:20.461 --> 15:21.962
be replaced by another

15:22.004 --> 15:23.423
mediocre old white man.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.841
Nothing will ever change.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.634
All right, well, what

15:24.883 --> 15:26.634
about all your goals

15:26.676 --> 15:28.094
for the Nine-Nine?

15:28.135 --> 15:29.596
You still have

15:28.135 --> 15:29.596
so much left to accomplish.

15:29.637 --> 15:30.805
Wrong,

15:29.637 --> 15:30.805
I've accomplished everything

15:30.847 --> 15:32.181
that I set out to do.

15:32.223 --> 15:33.808
I wanted

15:32.223 --> 15:33.808
to reduce crime, and I did.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.184
There's no crime

15:33.850 --> 15:35.184
in Brooklyn anymore.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.770
Seems like

15:35.226 --> 15:36.770
a bit of a stretch.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.688
What about improving

15:36.811 --> 15:38.688
community relations?

15:38.730 --> 15:40.064
Done. Everyone

15:38.730 --> 15:40.064
loves the police.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.775
It's embarrassing.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.192
Way off. All right, Ame,

15:41.816 --> 15:43.192
step aside; I got this.

15:43.234 --> 15:45.152
Captain, what about

15:43.234 --> 15:45.152
the Halloween Heist?

15:45.194 --> 15:47.113
I'll just come in and win it

15:45.194 --> 15:47.113
and then go back to my house.

15:47.154 --> 15:49.115
-Damn it. I'm out.

15:47.154 --> 15:49.115
-Jake.

15:49.156 --> 15:51.242
All right, fine. Sir, do you

15:49.156 --> 15:51.242
know why I love coming to work?

15:51.284 --> 15:52.993
Because there's a bumper

15:51.284 --> 15:52.993
pool table in the break room.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.788
Yes, obviously I love

15:53.035 --> 15:54.788
the bumper pool table.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.457
But do you want to know

15:54.829 --> 15:57.457
another reason why?

15:57.498 --> 15:58.917
You.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.042
You've made me a better cop.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.586
You've made me a better person.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.671
I've learned so much from you.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.799
So you can't quit.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.551
Because I need you.

16:08.593 --> 16:11.220
-Oh, please. How selfish.

16:08.593 --> 16:11.220
-What?

16:11.262 --> 16:12.597
That little speech

16:11.262 --> 16:12.597
you just gave.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.348
It was all about you

16:12.639 --> 16:14.348
and what you need.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.309
How unbelievably selfish.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.394
OK, well, I don't want

16:16.350 --> 16:18.394
to get mad right now,

16:18.436 --> 16:20.313
'cause I know Amy is worried

16:18.436 --> 16:20.313
about you, so--

16:20.354 --> 16:22.106
No, screw that noise.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.983
How dare you call Jake selfish?

16:24.024 --> 16:26.235
He just wasted

16:24.024 --> 16:26.235
his entire honeymoon

16:26.277 --> 16:28.028
trying to take care of you

16:26.277 --> 16:28.028
while you wallowed

16:28.070 --> 16:30.072
in your misery

16:28.070 --> 16:30.072
like a little baby.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.074
-That seems a little harsh.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.074
-Oh, does it?

16:32.116 --> 16:33.952
-I don't give a hoot.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.952
-Oh, damn.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.078
For the last five years,

16:33.993 --> 16:36.078
all I've done is

16:36.120 --> 16:38.832
give a hoot about you

16:36.120 --> 16:38.832
and what you think.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.708
I gave a hoot about

16:38.873 --> 16:40.708
you as a boss.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.168
I gave a hoot about

16:40.750 --> 16:42.168
you as a mentor.

16:42.209 --> 16:44.044
I gave a hoot about

16:42.209 --> 16:44.044
you as a friend.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.713
She gave so many hoots.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.799
Not anymore.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.799
After the way you've acted

16:47.841 --> 16:50.050
and what you just said

16:47.841 --> 16:50.050
to Jake, I don't give a hoot,

16:50.092 --> 16:52.052
what you think,

16:50.092 --> 16:52.052
and I really don't

16:52.094 --> 16:55.515
give a hoot if you decide

16:52.094 --> 16:55.515
to quit the NYPD, so do it.

16:55.556 --> 16:56.724
I'm all out of hoots.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.100
I'm hootless!

16:59.435 --> 17:01.354
-Now, what I want to say is--

16:59.435 --> 17:01.354
-[Amy] Jake!

17:01.395 --> 17:02.605
Coming, Holly Gennaro!

17:06.025 --> 17:08.778
Hey, I thought piña coladas

17:06.025 --> 17:08.778
might be too festive,

17:08.820 --> 17:10.864
so I got two super-depressing

17:08.820 --> 17:10.864
coconuts filled with merlot.

17:10.905 --> 17:13.073
I'm not depressed.

17:10.905 --> 17:13.073
I'm relieved.

17:13.115 --> 17:16.035
For the first time all week,

17:13.115 --> 17:16.035
it's just the two of us.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.662
I'm right here.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.455
I escaped using some

17:17.704 --> 17:19.455
of the lube Boyle sent you.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.207
It got everywhere.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.207
I had to change.

17:21.248 --> 17:24.168
Yeah, and your new shirt is

17:21.248 --> 17:24.168
very aggressive and confusing.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.419
Is the pineapple the slut,

17:25.461 --> 17:26.754
or is it calling

17:25.461 --> 17:26.754
someone else a slut?

17:26.796 --> 17:28.422
Clearly the pineapple

17:26.796 --> 17:28.422
is the slut.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.757
-Huh.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.757
-Look, I wanted to say

17:29.799 --> 17:31.217
-I'm sorry.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.217
-Yeah?

17:31.258 --> 17:33.052
Maybe find someone

17:31.258 --> 17:33.052
who gives a hoot.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.804
Try an owl cage.

17:34.846 --> 17:37.223
Oh, honey, I love you,

17:34.846 --> 17:37.223
but not your best.

17:37.264 --> 17:39.475
Look, you have every right

17:37.264 --> 17:39.475
not to accept my apology,

17:39.517 --> 17:41.519
but at least hear it first.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.145
I'm sorry

17:41.561 --> 17:43.145
I said Jake was selfish.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.023
I'm sorry I ruined

17:43.187 --> 17:45.023
your honeymoon.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.817
I'm sorry I interrupted your

17:45.105 --> 17:47.817
"Die Hard"-themed sexcapades.

17:47.859 --> 17:50.737
You don't have to

17:47.859 --> 17:50.737
list everything; it's cool.

17:50.778 --> 17:53.740
Right. I thought if

17:50.778 --> 17:53.740
I played by the NYPD's rules

17:53.781 --> 17:56.034
and didn't make any waves, one

17:53.781 --> 17:56.034
day I would rise to a position

17:56.075 --> 17:57.952
where I could make

17:56.075 --> 17:57.952
meaningful change.

17:57.994 --> 18:01.039
When they hired John Kelly,

17:57.994 --> 18:01.039
I realized I was wrong,

18:01.080 --> 18:02.957
and I thought I was

18:01.080 --> 18:02.957
out of options.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.043
But then you tied me

18:02.999 --> 18:05.043
to your bed, legs akimbo,

18:05.084 --> 18:08.963
and made me realize

18:05.084 --> 18:08.963
there was another way.

18:09.005 --> 18:11.298
I could not give a hoot.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.383
Wow, the hoot thing

18:11.340 --> 18:12.383
is catching on.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.968
Didn't see that coming.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.428
I'm going to go directly

18:14.010 --> 18:15.428
to the mayor and tell him

18:15.469 --> 18:18.014
John Kelly's "vigilant

18:15.469 --> 18:18.014
policing" proposal

18:18.056 --> 18:19.599
is regressive and

18:18.056 --> 18:19.599
counter-productive,

18:19.640 --> 18:21.851
and if he implements it,

18:19.640 --> 18:21.851
I'm gonna make

18:21.893 --> 18:23.728
a big stink in the press.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.438
Going over the commissioner

18:23.770 --> 18:25.438
and threatening the mayor, sir?

18:25.479 --> 18:27.273
Don't you think

18:25.479 --> 18:27.273
that'll piss him off?

18:27.314 --> 18:30.026
I don't give a hoot.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.736
Listen, I'm on

18:30.068 --> 18:31.736
the next plane back,

18:31.778 --> 18:33.863
but I wanted to pay

18:31.778 --> 18:33.863
for you two to extend your stay

18:33.905 --> 18:35.949
so you can have

18:33.905 --> 18:35.949
a proper honeymoon.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.909
Oh, sir, thank you.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.786
That's very nice. Right, Jake?

18:39.827 --> 18:41.120
Yeah, super cool.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.747
Just out of curiosity,

18:41.161 --> 18:42.747
asking for a friend,

18:42.789 --> 18:44.665
where did you get the shirt,

18:42.789 --> 18:44.665
and how much did it cost?

18:44.707 --> 18:46.751
Ooh, you're

18:44.707 --> 18:46.751
still wearing the mask?

18:46.793 --> 18:49.670
[Charles] Yeah, to hide

18:46.793 --> 18:49.670
my sadness. I'll take it off.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.338
No, don't.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.132
For some reason, it's easier

18:51.380 --> 18:53.132
to care about what you say

18:53.173 --> 18:54.717
when you look like me.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.427
Why did you tell your mom

18:54.759 --> 18:56.427
to leave my dad, Gina?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.429
Is it so bad being a Boyle?

18:58.471 --> 19:01.432
Yes, it terrible,

18:58.471 --> 19:01.432
but that's not why I did it.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.142
My mom was cheating

19:01.474 --> 19:03.142
on your dad,

19:03.183 --> 19:04.769
so I told her

19:03.183 --> 19:04.769
she had to break it off.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.270
What? Why didn't you tell me?

19:06.312 --> 19:08.106
Because I didn't want

19:06.312 --> 19:08.106
to hurt you or him.

19:08.188 --> 19:10.608
She was being disgusting,

19:08.188 --> 19:10.608
so I told her she had to end it.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.026
You were trying

19:10.650 --> 19:12.026
to protect us.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.486
Gina, you were actually

19:12.068 --> 19:13.486
being sweet.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.780
Uh-doi.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.824
-How's it going, Sarge?

19:15.822 --> 19:17.824
-Not good.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.909
I'm reading this book

19:17.865 --> 19:19.909
on religion, and apparently

19:19.951 --> 19:21.828
there's some debate

19:19.951 --> 19:21.828
as to what God is.

19:21.869 --> 19:22.996
Don't worry about it.

19:23.037 --> 19:24.371
-Gina had the manual.

19:23.037 --> 19:24.371
-What?

19:24.413 --> 19:25.539
Why didn't

19:24.413 --> 19:25.539
she just give it to me?

19:25.581 --> 19:27.291
'Cause she's a rascal.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.835
Look at what it says.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.045
"Never use italics,

19:28.876 --> 19:31.045
lest people think you are

19:31.087 --> 19:32.505
a con-man or a clown."

19:32.546 --> 19:34.590
I'm not sure

19:32.546 --> 19:34.590
how this applies here.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.216
No. Under that.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.469
"If you are unsure

19:36.258 --> 19:38.469
of what to do in any situation,

19:38.511 --> 19:41.514
"consult Sergeant Jeffords.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.724
I trust him completely."

19:43.766 --> 19:45.267
Well, that's

19:43.766 --> 19:45.267
a kick in the butt.

19:45.309 --> 19:48.021
So what should I do, Sarge?

19:48.062 --> 19:50.314
Tell sanitation you'll

19:48.062 --> 19:50.314
work the case together.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.650
You're the primary,

19:50.356 --> 19:52.650
and HQ can take it out

19:52.692 --> 19:53.776
of the supplemental budget.

19:53.818 --> 19:55.695
-I'll find the room.

19:53.818 --> 19:55.695
-Cool.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.697
Top Dog Terry's back.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.697
[barks]

19:57.738 --> 19:58.990
[barks]

19:59.032 --> 20:00.867
[Jake]

19:59.032 --> 20:00.867
OK, you ready?

20:00.908 --> 20:03.036
Mm-hmm.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.578
-[gasps]

20:03.077 --> 20:04.578
-Hello.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.164
Oh, my God.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.456
Are you Melvil Dewey?

20:07.498 --> 20:08.875
Indeed I am.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.251
I invented

20:08.916 --> 20:11.251
the Dewey decimal system,

20:11.293 --> 20:15.173
but right now I'm working on

20:11.293 --> 20:15.173
the Do-me decimal system.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.340
Mm-hmm, yeah.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.341
This is really working for me.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.467
-Really?

20:17.383 --> 20:18.467
-Yeah.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.344
-Awesome.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.344
-So, Mr. Dewey,

20:20.386 --> 20:22.555
can you save me from the

20:20.386 --> 20:22.555
terrorists that have taken over

20:22.596 --> 20:23.556
Nakatomi Plaza?

20:23.597 --> 20:25.641
Yes, Holly Gennaro,

20:25.683 --> 20:30.437
I just need to file them

20:25.683 --> 20:30.437
in the library...

20:25.683 --> 20:30.437
card... catalog.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.564
Yeah, this is

20:30.479 --> 20:31.564
really hard to track.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.066
Let's just take

20:31.605 --> 20:33.066
our clothes off.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.233
Oh, thank God.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.233
This old jacket is so hot.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.484
Yeah.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.361
<i>[Amy]</i>

20:35.526 --> 20:37.361
<i>That was magical.</i>

20:37.403 --> 20:39.405
-I can't believe we're back.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.405
-I refuse to accept it.

20:39.446 --> 20:40.698
I'm still coconuting.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.908
This is filled with coffee.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.159
It is very hot.

20:43.201 --> 20:44.493
Coconut is not a good

20:43.201 --> 20:44.493
insulator.

20:44.535 --> 20:46.370
No, it's not.

20:46.412 --> 20:47.872
-Captain.

20:46.412 --> 20:47.872
-Peralta, Santiago,

20:47.914 --> 20:49.415
how was the end

20:47.914 --> 20:49.415
of the honeymoon?

20:49.456 --> 20:50.833
It was amazing.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.877
Not to brag,

20:50.875 --> 20:52.877
but I saw a sea turtle.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.212
Kind of sounds like

20:52.919 --> 20:54.212
you're bragging, babe.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.713
I was.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.713
It looked right at me.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.506
How'd it go here?

20:55.755 --> 20:57.506
Did you contact the mayor?

20:57.548 --> 20:59.217
Yes. I voiced my concerns

20:57.548 --> 20:59.217
as soon as I got back.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.094
He heard me out,

20:59.258 --> 21:01.094
and he's put John Kelly's

21:01.135 --> 21:03.054
"vigilant policing" initiative

21:01.135 --> 21:03.054
under review.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.556
Way to go, No Hoots Holt.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.433
-Was Kelly pissed?

21:05.598 --> 21:07.433
-Very much so.

21:07.474 --> 21:10.144
To retaliate, he closed the

21:07.474 --> 21:10.144
bottom floor of the Nine-Nine

21:10.186 --> 21:11.645
for renovations indefinitely.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.189
Everyone's been moved

21:11.687 --> 21:13.189
to our bullpen.

21:13.231 --> 21:14.899
-Wait. What?

21:13.231 --> 21:14.899
-[elevator dings]

21:14.941 --> 21:16.650
Prepare yourselves.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.571
The Nine-Nine is

21:17.944 --> 21:20.571
at war with the NYPD.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.784
[both] Ay caramba.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.869
<i>-Not a doctor.</i>

21:24.825 --> 21:26.869
-Shh.

21:26.911 --> 21:29.038
<i>Fremulon.</i>
