40:18.541 --> 40:20.665
Thanks, Holly.

40:33.833 --> 40:35.665
He thinks I blame him.

40:38.916 --> 40:40.540
Do you?

40:59.916 --> 41:02.165
That's me.

41:06.666 --> 41:08.790
Oh... Keir Willis.

41:08.916 --> 41:11.290
He was such a baby.

41:13.875 --> 41:16.415
That's me again.

41:26.416 --> 41:28.582
Duncan Fletcher.

41:28.708 --> 41:30.457
He wet himself.

41:36.625 --> 41:38.957
It was so funny.

41:39.833 --> 41:41.707
See?

41:45.833 --> 41:48.290
He wet his pants.

41:58.541 --> 42:00.999
Rhys Agnew.

42:01.625 --> 42:03.624
Boring!

42:07.666 --> 42:10.457
Here's the one that got away.

42:10.583 --> 42:12.290
Timmy Valentine.

42:23.666 --> 42:26.040
He's probably dead by now.

42:31.333 --> 42:34.124
And lucky last...

42:40.166 --> 42:41.665
Oh!

42:50.333 --> 42:52.040
I'm ready to draw on him now.

43:14.250 --> 43:17.207
Shall we go in after this?

43:17.333 --> 43:19.207
Sick of me already?

43:19.333 --> 43:21.624
No. No, I just thought...

43:21.750 --> 43:24.082
...you know, maybe we should
eat something.

43:31.541 --> 43:33.749
Come here.

43:33.875 --> 43:35.915
I'll feed you.

43:56.416 --> 43:59.499
Your drawing gets better every time.

44:05.916 --> 44:07.499
Throw it.

44:11.541 --> 44:15.332
Not too much.
It's supposed to be bad for you.

44:43.333 --> 44:47.249
We can't hear you!

44:47.375 --> 44:51.332
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!

46:05.250 --> 46:08.624
Maybe...
Maybe we should go in.

46:21.625 --> 46:23.832
Oh, here! You all right?

46:33.458 --> 46:36.040
And this year's
Queen of the Dance is...

46:42.541 --> 46:44.207
...Lola Stone!

47:02.125 --> 47:09.082
Blow your whistle, King.

47:10.291 --> 47:11.332
Daddy!

47:20.833 --> 47:22.290
Crown me.

47:53.875 --> 47:56.082
"Oh, So Lonesome For You")

48:15.166 --> 48:19.249
d I've been tried and then tempted

48:20.208 --> 48:24.999
d But now I'm leaving today

48:25.125 --> 48:28.999
d All we had, baby's over

48:29.666 --> 48:33.707
d So I be on my way

48:34.541 --> 48:39.165
d Go onto another

48:39.291 --> 48:43.124
d And don't you pay me no mind

48:44.250 --> 48:48.749
d You're yet to discover

48:48.875 --> 48:52.707
d Loving something you'll find

48:54.458 --> 49:02.290
d Oh, my head in my hands,
it is sinking

49:04.333 --> 49:11.707
d And my heart inside me is torn

49:14.083 --> 49:18.374
d Are you sitting true...

49:18.500 --> 49:20.415
What the fuck are you looking at?

49:20.541 --> 49:23.165
d ...we were through

49:23.291 --> 49:27.124
d But I'll be oh, so lonesome... d

49:27.250 --> 49:31.832
If you want to do that sort of thing
I suggest you go somewhere else.

49:42.916 --> 49:44.415
"Not Pretty Enough")

49:44.541 --> 49:48.040
d Am I not pretty enough?

49:48.166 --> 49:51.540
d Is my heart too broken?

49:51.666 --> 49:56.040
d Do I cry too much?

49:56.166 --> 49:59.874
d Am I too outspoken?

50:00.000 --> 50:03.999
d Don't I make you laugh?

50:04.125 --> 50:07.707
d Should I try it harder?

50:07.833 --> 50:08.832
d Why do you see...

50:08.958 --> 50:11.332
When I find my Prince,

50:11.458 --> 50:15.707
this is the song we're gonna dance to
at my wedding.

50:15.833 --> 50:19.415
d I live, I breathe

50:19.541 --> 50:22.707
d I let it rain on me

50:22.833 --> 50:23.874
d I see... d

50:24.000 --> 50:27.124
But you're not him.

50:27.250 --> 50:29.999
You're just another FROG!

50:31.750 --> 50:35.207
d I crave, I love

50:35.333 --> 50:39.249
d I've waited long enough...

50:39.916 --> 50:41.874
Dance with me, Daddy.

50:47.833 --> 50:52.207
d Am I not pretty enough?

50:52.333 --> 50:55.999
d Is my heart too broken?

50:56.125 --> 51:03.707
d Do I cry too much?

51:03.833 --> 51:07.957
d Am I too outspoken?
d Don't I make you laugh?

51:08.083 --> 51:11.790
d Should I try it harder?

51:11.916 --> 51:17.124
d Why do you see
right through me?

51:19.333 --> 51:23.082
d I laugh, I feel

51:23.208 --> 51:26.832
d I make believe it's real

51:26.958 --> 51:31.124
d I fall, I freeze

51:31.250 --> 51:35.499
d I pray down on my knees

51:35.625 --> 51:38.874
d I hope, I stand

51:39.000 --> 51:43.082
d I take it like a man... d

51:43.208 --> 51:45.749
You're the Prince.

51:50.458 --> 51:53.832
That's why I can't find one I like.

51:57.916 --> 52:00.749
It's always been you, Daddy.

52:03.541 --> 52:06.165
Just you and me...

52:07.833 --> 52:11.915
d Don't I make you laugh?

52:12.041 --> 52:15.999
d Should I try it harder?

52:16.125 --> 52:21.582
dWhy do you see
right through me?

52:21.708 --> 52:22.707
d Why do you... d

52:32.333 --> 52:34.374
Thanks.

52:34.500 --> 52:38.249
I contacted Search & Rescue.
They'll be here in the morning.

52:39.458 --> 52:43.499
But if you think of anything
or you need me, you ring me.

52:44.666 --> 52:46.999
We'll find him.

53:03.333 --> 53:05.874
'The person you are calling
is unavailable.'

53:06.000 --> 53:07.624
'Leave a message after the tone.'

53:07.750 --> 53:12.624
Hi Mum, I think it's late over there
so you're probably asleep.

53:12.750 --> 53:14.790
So er...

53:14.916 --> 53:17.332
I'll try again later.

53:17.458 --> 53:19.332
OK, bye.

53:43.625 --> 53:45.165
Catch!

54:12.791 --> 54:17.332
Drinkie, drinkie..
 Sing for your supper.

54:20.166 --> 54:22.207
Not loud enough.

54:24.500 --> 54:30.707
d She's a lost cause,
she's a lost, lost cause... d

54:45.958 --> 54:47.582
Fuck me.

55:07.500 --> 55:10.332
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

55:24.541 --> 55:27.415
When I said go somewhere else
I meant off school property.

55:41.333 --> 55:43.999
You're my first drilling.

55:53.250 --> 55:55.207
The trick is not to go too far.

55:55.333 --> 55:57.249
Just enough
to break through the skull.

56:03.166 --> 56:06.624
- Do you know how to turn it on?
- I'm not stupid.

56:11.500 --> 56:14.915
Remove the King's crown,
please, Daddy.

56:56.708 --> 56:58.290
You've got to push harder.

57:00.041 --> 57:01.290
Two hands.

57:02.958 --> 57:04.749
Cradle it into the body.

57:07.541 --> 57:08.749
That's the way.

57:36.500 --> 57:38.040
Stop!

57:49.833 --> 57:51.665
Perfect.

58:33.541 --> 58:36.540
It works, you know.

58:36.666 --> 58:41.415
It boils your brains
and turns you into one of them.

58:48.541 --> 58:51.165
Careful, it's hot.

59:19.750 --> 59:21.540
Sorry!

59:24.958 --> 59:26.874
You've got to give it a bigger tip.

59:44.541 --> 59:47.124
The hole's too small,
can you please make it bigger?

01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:42.415
Daddy?

01:00:45.833 --> 01:02:24.749
Daddy!

01:02:51.916 --> 01:02:53.499
Daddy.

01:04:26.666 --> 01:04:29.582
OK. You all right??
 Mmm.

01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:33.249
All right.
Now, we've just got two steps.

01:05:08.333 --> 01:05:11.499
Must've danced her off her feet.

01:06:20.958 --> 01:06:23.415
Why can't you find him?

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:44.332
- Is she all right?
- Yeah.

01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:22.957
Good night, Mummy.

01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:46.040
'Lola Stone.
That's who asked me.'

01:08:11.916 --> 01:08:13.624
Hello?

01:10:30.666 --> 01:10:33.707
I'm going to your house now.

01:10:33.833 --> 01:10:36.624
I'm going to stab your mummy
in the neck,

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:38.999
just like you did to my daddy.

01:10:47.166 --> 01:10:51.082
And then I'm going to stab Holly
in the heart.

01:10:51.208 --> 01:10:54.499
Just like you did to me.

01:11:57.875 --> 01:12:02.207
d Am I not pretty enough?

01:12:03.625 --> 01:12:07.999
d Is my heart too broken?

01:12:09.166 --> 01:12:13.749
d Do I cry too much?

01:12:14.708 --> 01:12:19.707
d Am I too outspoken?

01:12:20.625 --> 01:12:25.290
d Don't I make you laugh?

01:12:26.125 --> 01:12:31.332
d Should I try harder?
