WEBVTT

00:06.667 --> 00:08.633
Help us
understand, Colin.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.833
We know you did it.

00:10.900 --> 00:14.000
We just need you to tell
us when you got so angry

00:14.067 --> 00:16.167
that you decided
to do it.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.967
And how long
and how carefully

00:18.033 --> 00:19.867
you planned to kill
your ex-wife.

00:19.933 --> 00:22.233
The judge will
need to know.

00:28.967 --> 00:33.567
When was it, Colin?
When she got engaged?

00:33.633 --> 00:35.967
Or when they talked
to you about

00:36.033 --> 00:38.233
moving your children
out of state?

00:38.300 --> 00:41.033
Or when you realized
she couldn't stand

00:41.100 --> 00:43.633
the sight of
your smug face?

01:02.133 --> 01:05.067
I understand
your frustration Colin.

01:06.333 --> 01:09.833
Some people can't appreciate
a love so profound

01:09.900 --> 01:11.367
that it requires
total commitment.

01:11.433 --> 01:13.200
Complete submission.

01:13.267 --> 01:16.967
Few deserve it and
even fewer receive it.

01:17.067 --> 01:19.300
That is true.

01:19.367 --> 01:22.067
When you demand that of
someone and they fail you,

01:22.133 --> 01:24.200
you have to correct the
situation, don't you?

01:24.267 --> 01:25.433
Of course you do.

01:25.500 --> 01:27.067
You have to make
them understand

01:27.067 --> 01:28.433
that you are in control.

01:28.500 --> 01:33.133
You choose who is loved, who
is forgiven, who is punished.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.767
It's my decision.

01:35.833 --> 01:40.067
I would never reject
a gift like that.

01:40.100 --> 01:46.433
But your ex-wife, she
threw it all away, for what?

01:46.500 --> 01:50.500
For a spineless school
teacher with no future.

01:50.567 --> 01:55.500
How could she be so
stupid? So blind?

01:55.567 --> 01:58.800
She needed to
be punished.

01:58.867 --> 02:05.333
And I explained that to
her and she laughed.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.533
She laughed.

02:08.600 --> 02:14.500
I tried to stop the laughter
and make her listen,

02:14.567 --> 02:19.767
but the more she laughed,
the more I had to squeeze.

02:29.433 --> 02:32.333
I didn't mean to --

02:41.200 --> 02:44.533
Not premeditated...
good work.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.600
Teamwork.

02:48.433 --> 02:50.833
We could see the guy
was unhinged.

02:50.900 --> 02:54.067
So Devin presses, then I pretend
I'm on Mr. X's wave length,

02:54.100 --> 02:57.200
and he just opens
up and tells us everything.

02:57.267 --> 02:59.500
Cries all the way
through processing.

02:59.567 --> 03:02.067
It was a little unnerving.

03:02.100 --> 03:03.367
Isn't that incredible?

03:03.433 --> 03:05.267
The most exciting thing
that happened to me today

03:05.333 --> 03:07.533
was having to run my own
PowerPoint during my lecture

03:07.600 --> 03:10.233
because my T.A.
called in sick.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.367
That's gotta keep you
on your toes though Matt.

03:12.433 --> 03:15.433
Always being seconds away
from an interrogation.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.300
Wouldn't have it
any other way.

03:17.367 --> 03:19.533
What's it like to have
that kind of power

03:19.600 --> 03:21.633
over other
people's lives?

03:21.700 --> 03:24.267
I don't really
think of it like that.

03:24.333 --> 03:27.833
I usually meet them
when they've lost control.

03:29.733 --> 03:30.700
You're not leaving
without saying hello

03:30.767 --> 03:34.233
to the McLeans,
are you, Krista?

03:34.300 --> 03:36.200
Hello, Mr. and
Mrs. McLean.

03:36.267 --> 03:38.467
Hey Krista, it's been ages
since we've seen you.

03:38.533 --> 03:40.667
You're so tall and pretty.

03:40.733 --> 03:42.133
Not that you weren't
always pretty.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.867
No, of course!
How's school?

03:44.933 --> 03:47.500
Super busy, in fact I've
gotta run over to Rosie's.

03:47.567 --> 03:50.300
We've got this massive
lab report tomorrow

03:50.367 --> 03:52.300
and the data's not crunching
the way it should.

03:52.367 --> 03:53.700
Okay, don't be too late.

03:53.767 --> 03:57.467
I won't, as long as the
silver nitrate cooperates.

03:57.533 --> 03:58.767
Nice to see you.

03:58.833 --> 04:03.167
Nice to see you too!

04:03.233 --> 04:06.067
She's on the
Honor Roll, again.

04:06.067 --> 04:07.833
It's okay to brag,
isn't it?

04:07.900 --> 04:11.067
Required.

04:11.133 --> 04:14.667
Refill, Come on.

04:16.367 --> 04:19.867
Umm... Allison?

04:19.933 --> 04:23.133
Are you having a
rough time with Rachel?

04:23.200 --> 04:25.067
No, we're actually
going through

04:25.067 --> 04:26.533
a really nice
phase right now.

04:26.600 --> 04:32.700
Krista's gotten quiet,
she's almost withdrawn.

04:32.767 --> 04:34.700
Well it's hard work
staying on the Honor Roll.

04:34.767 --> 04:36.467
Maybe it's stress?

04:36.533 --> 04:39.200
I wish I knew.

04:39.267 --> 04:43.267
Probably it's just hormones.
Mine, if not hers.

04:48.567 --> 04:50.567
I am not a poet!

04:50.633 --> 04:51.767
Don't I know it.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.433
You and Jeff have
Ms. Lowens, right?

04:53.500 --> 04:54.833
Yes.

04:54.900 --> 04:56.867
Just wait until she makes
you read them in class.

04:56.933 --> 04:58.500
Out loud?

04:58.567 --> 04:59.733
That's why I did a haiku.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.667
Seventeen syllables
and I'm back in my seat.

05:02.733 --> 05:04.300
When I had her Ms.
Lowens always said,

05:04.367 --> 05:05.433
write what you know.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.100
Shortest poem ever.

05:07.167 --> 05:08.900
Ha ha ha.

05:08.967 --> 05:10.900
Hey, gang.
How's it going?

05:10.967 --> 05:12.533
Most of us are done
with our homework.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.200
But not all of
us. Thank you.

05:15.267 --> 05:18.267
I need a more
creative space.

05:18.333 --> 05:19.967
Did you have a good time?

05:20.067 --> 05:24.300
Mrs. Harris is off sugar,
so dessert was avocado pudding.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.067
I may never recover.

05:26.067 --> 05:29.500
Hey, Dad, can we change
the light fixture in my room?

05:29.567 --> 05:32.100
Since I moved the
lamp, it feels dim.

05:32.167 --> 05:36.467
Wait, how bright are
we talking here?

05:36.533 --> 05:38.167
Krista says hi.

05:38.233 --> 05:40.900
Really?

05:40.967 --> 05:43.233
Well, not in
so many words.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.467
Do you guys talk
much these days?

05:45.533 --> 05:49.567
We pass in the hall,
but that's about it.

05:49.633 --> 05:52.067
We didn't have much in common
once I stopped taking ballet.

05:52.100 --> 05:54.367
So you wouldn't know
how she's doing?

05:54.433 --> 05:56.567
No, why?
Is she in trouble?

05:56.633 --> 05:57.933
No, I don't think so.

05:58.067 --> 06:01.067
Her mom's just a little
worried about her, that's all.

06:01.067 --> 06:02.833
You always say
that's a mom's job.

06:02.900 --> 06:05.833
Yeah, that and encouraging
ice cream consumption.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.333
Jeff!

06:08.400 --> 06:11.733
Let's get some for Dad.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.367
That avocado thing
was disgusting.

07:00.433 --> 07:03.567
This is one of my
favorite days in the quarter.

07:03.633 --> 07:06.067
Who'd like to share
their poem first?

07:08.200 --> 07:11.767
As the Bard said,
"Boldness be my friend."

07:11.833 --> 07:14.600
Mariah! I always knew
you were a brave soul.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.933
Let's hear it.

07:24.667 --> 07:29.100
Forever Alone.

07:29.167 --> 07:34.700
Caged in a room so small
I can barely breathe.

07:34.767 --> 07:36.833
There are no windows.

07:36.900 --> 07:42.467
The air, dusty and stale,
not a single crack of light.

07:42.533 --> 07:45.567
The door is a barricade,
locked up tight.

07:45.633 --> 07:48.167
No chance for escape.

07:48.233 --> 07:52.133
I call out, no one comes.

07:52.200 --> 07:56.300
Forever alone,
I sit small and still,

07:56.367 --> 08:01.067
shut my eyes and try
to remember to breathe.

08:11.300 --> 08:13.400
Exactly what I asked for:
pain on the page.

08:13.467 --> 08:16.500
Very real.
Excellent job, Mariah.

08:23.067 --> 08:26.767
Who else is ready
to bare their soul?

08:29.067 --> 08:30.467
Hey, Krista.

08:30.533 --> 08:31.567
Rachel.

08:31.633 --> 08:33.967
How've you been?

08:34.067 --> 08:36.433
Why would you
want to know?

08:36.500 --> 08:40.333
I realized we haven't
talked in a while and...

08:40.400 --> 08:43.267
my mom and dad got together
with your mom and dad.

08:43.333 --> 08:46.400
Yes, I saw them.

08:46.467 --> 08:47.633
They were talking
about you --

08:47.700 --> 08:48.967
All of them?

08:49.067 --> 08:51.067
No, our moms.

08:51.067 --> 08:52.867
Our dads were probably
talking about sports

08:52.933 --> 08:56.233
or politics or something.

08:56.300 --> 09:00.200
But it made me realize we
hadn't talked in a while

09:00.267 --> 09:02.700
and I wanted to come
over and say hi,

09:02.767 --> 09:04.400
see how you're doing.

09:04.467 --> 09:05.767
I'm great.

09:05.833 --> 09:06.933
Tons of homework tonight,

09:07.067 --> 09:10.467
so I've got to get
home and study.

09:10.533 --> 09:13.433
It was nice
to talk to you.

09:29.967 --> 09:30.767
Good morning.

09:30.833 --> 09:31.900
Good morning!

09:31.967 --> 09:34.267
You have a friend
waiting for you.

09:34.333 --> 09:37.867
May I help you...?

09:37.933 --> 09:39.533
Diane?

09:39.600 --> 09:40.833
I don't know what to do.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.733
Okay, tell me what happened.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.767
Krista never came
home last night.

09:44.867 --> 09:48.200
She's gone.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.900
My lieutenant thought we'd
be more comfortable in here.

10:11.267 --> 10:13.467
Have a seat.

10:14.467 --> 10:16.100
Walk me through
what happened.

10:16.167 --> 10:19.533
She just went to see
a movie with a friend.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.833
And it got
later and later.

10:21.900 --> 10:27.667
I kept calling her cell and
it kept going to voicemail.

10:27.733 --> 10:33.433
So I thought her phone died
or she lost track of time.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.467
But then the sun came up...

10:36.533 --> 10:39.933
Krista's a good girl, she
doesn't stay out all night.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.600
What if something
terrible happened?

10:41.667 --> 10:44.033
Let's not jump to conclusions.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.267
Is it possible
Krista ran away?

10:46.333 --> 10:50.067
No, I checked her room,
there's nothing missing.

10:50.133 --> 10:53.200
Something awful happened,
I just know it.

10:53.267 --> 10:55.300
We're going to treat this
as a missing person case.

10:55.367 --> 10:58.567
I'm going to need to
ask you a few questions.

10:58.633 --> 11:01.500
Okay, who was she
out with last night?

11:01.567 --> 11:04.633
I'm not sure she said.

11:04.700 --> 11:07.200
Best friend?

11:09.233 --> 11:11.867
Liz Holloway,
they're on Yearbook together.

11:11.933 --> 11:12.967
Boyfriend?

11:13.067 --> 11:15.100
No, she's so focused
on her schoolwork,

11:15.167 --> 11:18.300
she doesn't have time.

11:18.367 --> 11:19.667
All right.

11:19.733 --> 11:21.767
I know this is hard, but
I want you to go home

11:21.833 --> 11:23.233
and just stay there.
Where's Charlie?

11:23.300 --> 11:25.300
He's out looking
for her himself.

11:25.367 --> 11:28.067
I will keep you posted
on everything we learn,

11:28.100 --> 11:29.700
everything we do.

11:29.767 --> 11:31.933
We're going to find Krista.

11:33.400 --> 11:36.867
Mariah, come sit for a sec.

11:39.300 --> 11:44.367
I wanted to check in and
see how things are going.

11:44.433 --> 11:48.500
Your poem was
really powerful.

11:48.567 --> 11:52.833
That small, dark room;
ideal metaphor for loneliness.

11:52.900 --> 11:55.567
Thank you.

11:55.633 --> 12:01.600
The caged and neglected
imagery was powerful too.

12:01.667 --> 12:04.267
I knew that your family
situation was difficult,

12:04.333 --> 12:09.067
but I didn't realize how
challenging things had been.

12:12.200 --> 12:17.267
That's why I loved
this assignment.

12:17.333 --> 12:20.433
It let me express my pain.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.400
I'm glad you did.

12:22.467 --> 12:24.400
Expressing your
feelings is important,

12:24.467 --> 12:28.067
and so is knowing
that you're not alone.

12:28.133 --> 12:30.900
People care
about you, okay?

12:30.967 --> 12:33.800
I really appreciate it.

12:35.067 --> 12:38.067
Okay, just don't be late.

12:41.633 --> 12:43.800
So Liz, you're
Krista's best friend?

12:43.867 --> 12:45.567
Not really.

12:45.633 --> 12:47.433
I mean, she's
sweet and all,

12:47.500 --> 12:49.833
but we aren't super
close or anything.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.300
She was our
lead photographer,

12:51.367 --> 12:53.067
but she quit a
couple weeks ago.

12:53.133 --> 12:55.467
Why'd she quit?
A fight with someone?

12:55.533 --> 12:58.867
No, she just... quit.

12:58.933 --> 13:02.233
We've been scrambling to
cover stuff ever since.

13:02.300 --> 13:03.600
Could we see her pictures?

13:03.667 --> 13:04.667
Sure.

13:05.933 --> 13:08.667
Did she mention
any other problems?

13:08.733 --> 13:11.233
Krista runs
pretty cool and quiet.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.067
What exactly are
you guys looking for?

13:13.067 --> 13:15.233
Anything that stands out.

13:15.300 --> 13:16.967
Like that one.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.500
Oh, him!

13:21.567 --> 13:22.967
Who is that?

13:23.067 --> 13:24.733
He doesn't go here.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.667
Trust me, I keep track
of the cute guys.

13:27.733 --> 13:29.667
I ran into him and
Krista at the mall,

13:29.733 --> 13:34.067
but he pulled her away.
Talk about rude.

13:34.100 --> 13:37.633
Was there anything else
distinctive about him?

13:37.700 --> 13:40.133
He was wearing a Lakeside
High letterman jacket.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.533
That's great.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.067
You've been a really
big help, thank you.

13:44.100 --> 13:46.267
Could you print us off
one of these pictures?

13:46.333 --> 13:48.633
No problem.

13:48.700 --> 13:51.600
So it looks like
she has a boyfriend.

14:00.067 --> 14:02.267
Hey.

14:02.333 --> 14:06.333
Hey. What's up?

14:06.400 --> 14:10.200
My editor sent
me to ask you...

14:10.267 --> 14:11.800
Can the Crestview
High Clarion

14:11.867 --> 14:14.333
print your poem on
the Arts page?

14:14.400 --> 14:17.767
The editor?
She's a senior!

14:17.833 --> 14:19.633
How did she hear
about my poem?

14:19.700 --> 14:21.067
Who knows?

14:21.133 --> 14:24.067
I'm not really a part of
English Geeks Underground.

14:24.133 --> 14:27.667
But, if it's too private,
I can just tell her...

14:27.733 --> 14:29.333
Tell her yes!

14:29.400 --> 14:31.267
Really?

14:31.333 --> 14:34.500
And tell her there's
more where that came from.

14:42.867 --> 14:46.400
Who told you to talk to
me about Brent White?

14:46.467 --> 14:48.500
And why don't you
just talk to Brent?

14:48.567 --> 14:50.500
Your principal told us
he's at the volleyball game.

14:50.567 --> 14:52.933
Right.

14:53.067 --> 14:54.600
Be careful.

14:54.667 --> 14:56.067
They're going to get creamed,

14:56.100 --> 14:58.633
so he'll be lots of fun to talk
to when they get back.

14:58.700 --> 15:00.867
Several people told
us you dated him.

15:00.933 --> 15:02.267
For all of ten seconds.

15:02.333 --> 15:04.967
Mind telling us what happened?

15:07.067 --> 15:09.667
He was all worked
up about a loss,

15:09.733 --> 15:14.433
I told him it was just a
game, and he slapped me.

15:16.433 --> 15:18.600
I was out the door.

15:18.667 --> 15:22.467
My mother taught me:
a man raises his hand,

15:22.533 --> 15:24.200
you leave.

15:24.267 --> 15:25.867
Good for you.

15:25.933 --> 15:27.800
Did you tell
anyone what he did?

15:27.867 --> 15:29.500
No.

15:29.567 --> 15:32.067
But people know
what he's like.

15:32.133 --> 15:35.433
Everything has to be a
certain way, his way.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.667
Most girls steer clear.

15:37.733 --> 15:39.967
So he found a girl
at another school.

15:40.067 --> 15:45.267
He did?
Is she okay?

15:45.333 --> 15:48.500
We hope so.

15:52.467 --> 15:53.767
Excuse me.

15:53.833 --> 15:55.733
I'm Detective McLean,
this is Detective Stewart.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.067
We're looking
for Brent White.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.867
Yeah? Me too.

15:58.933 --> 16:00.967
If we'd had him, we might've
had a fighting chance.

16:01.067 --> 16:02.300
He didn't play today?

16:02.367 --> 16:04.633
No, fool kid said he'd get
to the game on his own,

16:04.700 --> 16:05.667
and never showed.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.633
Thanks.

16:10.967 --> 16:13.733
So, Krista is missing,
and then her boyfriend,

16:13.800 --> 16:17.067
who has a history of
violence, disappears too.

16:17.067 --> 16:18.767
I don't like where
this is headed.

16:18.833 --> 16:22.633
You think he
took her by force?

16:33.200 --> 16:36.900
Mrs. White?

16:36.967 --> 16:42.067
Ma'am? Crestview PD.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.367
Let's check around back.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.600
If you're salesman,
I don't want any.

17:05.667 --> 17:06.667
If you're cops, I'm clean.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.167
Detectives Stewart
and McLean.

17:09.233 --> 17:10.833
Why're you sniffing
around my place?

17:10.900 --> 17:13.633
Are you Gwen White?
Brent White's mother?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.300
What did the
little jerk do?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.533
Did your son come
home last night?

17:17.600 --> 17:19.767
How should I know?
I didn't.

17:19.833 --> 17:23.233
Ms. White, Brent's girlfriend
Krista is missing.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.800
We believe they
might be together.

17:24.867 --> 17:26.567
Do you have any
idea where?

17:26.633 --> 17:28.333
Look, My son and I
have a don't ask,

17:28.400 --> 17:29.800
don't tell policy.

17:29.867 --> 17:31.367
I don't ask who he
spends his time with,

17:31.433 --> 17:35.700
and I don't tell him
who spends time with me.

17:35.767 --> 17:41.067
Oh, maybe he
is home...

17:41.067 --> 17:42.500
No no no no...

17:42.567 --> 17:44.667
Ah, crap!

17:44.733 --> 17:48.200
That lousy,
good-for-nothing...

17:48.267 --> 17:50.167
That weasel
stole my savings!

17:50.233 --> 17:51.400
Three thousand dollars!

17:51.467 --> 17:53.200
Ms. White, focus!

17:53.267 --> 17:56.633
Can you think of anything that
might help us find your son?

17:56.700 --> 17:58.433
I wish I could.

17:58.500 --> 18:01.800
But I want you to get out
there and track him down,

18:01.867 --> 18:03.533
and bring him back
to me, and I will

18:03.600 --> 18:06.867
rip those heard-earned dollars
out of his hand myself.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.900
Hey, Rachel.
Do you have a sec?

18:25.967 --> 18:28.667
Yeah, I guess thermodynamic
equilibrium can wait.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.167
What's up?

18:33.400 --> 18:36.567
Ms. Lowens said I could write
another poem for extra credit.

18:36.633 --> 18:39.133
Could you read it?

18:39.200 --> 18:41.500
I want to make sure it sounds
okay before turning it in.

18:41.567 --> 18:44.167
Yeah, sure.

18:44.233 --> 18:45.800
The Prisoner

18:45.867 --> 18:47.233
I have been in
this room for days,

18:47.300 --> 18:48.833
The Princess in her prison.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.933
Only rags to wear,
scraps to eat.

18:51.067 --> 18:54.067
I huddle in the corner,
covered in filth and shivering.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.933
The darkness my only blanket.

18:57.067 --> 18:59.067
The King and Queen
are too busy

18:59.067 --> 19:01.467
to care for their
forgotten princess,

19:01.533 --> 19:03.933
to hear her
anguished cries.

19:04.067 --> 19:05.867
And so I remain alone.

19:05.933 --> 19:10.433
My only companions, the rats
that scurry across my feet.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.733
I dream of the
sun on my face,

19:12.800 --> 19:15.067
but I am scared
I will wither here

19:15.100 --> 19:17.500
'til there's nothing
left of me but bone.

19:20.833 --> 19:21.600
Mariah...

19:21.667 --> 19:23.367
Intense, right?

19:23.433 --> 19:25.467
Yeah, definitely,

19:25.533 --> 19:28.067
You're going to
freak Ms. Lowens out.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.500
Perfect!

19:33.167 --> 19:34.967
Thanks.

19:36.533 --> 19:38.200
The lojack on Brent's
jeep is disabled,

19:38.267 --> 19:40.267
as are the location
apps on their phones.

19:40.333 --> 19:41.700
We should move to
an Amber Alert.

19:41.800 --> 19:42.767
We can't.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.300
She doesn't meet
the criteria.

19:44.367 --> 19:47.067
There isn't enough evidence
she was actually kidnapped.

19:47.133 --> 19:50.233
Even with Brent's history of
abuse and the stolen cash?

19:50.300 --> 19:51.900
Allison.

19:51.967 --> 19:55.733
Charlie, Diane. This is my
partner, Devin Stewart.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.167
Mr. and Mrs. Harris,

19:57.233 --> 19:58.733
we're doing everything we
can to find your daughter.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.667
What have you learned?

20:00.733 --> 20:03.967
It appears that Krista
is in a relationship.

20:04.033 --> 20:06.467
With a boy named
Brent White.

20:06.833 --> 20:08.800
I'm sorry, what?

20:08.867 --> 20:12.033
Brent White.
He's also missing.

20:12.100 --> 20:13.733
Did you know
about this kid?

20:13.800 --> 20:16.900
No! I'm as surprised
as you are.

20:16.967 --> 20:19.267
What happens now?

20:19.333 --> 20:20.700
We're issuing a
countywide alert.

20:20.767 --> 20:22.533
I'm gonna need some
recent photos of Krista,

20:22.600 --> 20:24.333
and I can come
pick them up.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.200
That way we can get
them to all agencies

20:26.267 --> 20:27.100
as soon as possible.

20:27.167 --> 20:28.467
Of course.

20:28.533 --> 20:30.067
We're assembling a
timeline of recent events,

20:30.133 --> 20:31.967
and looking for
electronic footprints,

20:32.033 --> 20:34.367
financial transactions
and other online activity

20:34.433 --> 20:35.800
that led up to their
disappearance.

20:35.867 --> 20:37.767
And we're continuing to
talk to people who know them.

20:37.833 --> 20:39.333
This is unbelievable.
Who's this kid?

20:39.400 --> 20:41.900
Where are his parents?
I want to talk to them!

20:41.967 --> 20:44.867
Charlie, that's not
productive right now, okay?

20:44.933 --> 20:47.767
I know you're hurting,
and I'm so sorry,

20:47.833 --> 20:50.433
but can you just let
us take care of it?

20:50.500 --> 20:52.467
Keep us in the loop.
Find her.

20:52.533 --> 20:54.633
Of course.

21:02.633 --> 21:04.500
Isn't that your
English teacher, Jeff?

21:04.567 --> 21:07.133
I've turned
everything in, on time.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.167
Mr. McLean?

21:08.233 --> 21:09.700
Ms. Lowens, hi.
How are you?

21:09.767 --> 21:11.167
Hi, good.
Hey Jeff.

21:11.233 --> 21:13.133
I hoped I might catch you.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.233
There's something I
wanted to share with you.

21:15.300 --> 21:17.200
It's not
about you, Jeff.

21:17.267 --> 21:18.667
You're doing just fine.

21:18.733 --> 21:20.500
And your haiku
was delightful.

21:20.567 --> 21:22.500
It's about your
niece, Mariah.

21:24.100 --> 21:25.300
She's struggling?

21:25.367 --> 21:27.967
Her grades are fine.

21:28.067 --> 21:32.100
Her poetry
assignment troubles me.

21:32.167 --> 21:33.433
Troubles you
in what way?

21:33.500 --> 21:36.500
She's very creative and I
don't want to stifle that.

21:36.567 --> 21:39.200
But...

21:39.267 --> 21:41.267
her imagery has a
consistent theme of

21:41.333 --> 21:44.333
abandonment and neglect.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.567
I just wonder if maybe she's
trying to reveal something.

21:48.300 --> 21:52.467
She hasn't had the
easiest road, but...

21:52.533 --> 21:54.667
We'll read all these
and we'll talk to her.

21:54.733 --> 21:55.900
Thanks for your concern.

21:55.967 --> 21:57.867
And if I, or our
guidance counsellor,

21:57.933 --> 22:00.533
can be of any
help, just call.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.733
Yes, we will.
Thanks.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.533
Okay.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.067
My haiku was delightful.

22:10.133 --> 22:12.533
That's awesome Jeff.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.967
Her teacher said what?

22:15.067 --> 22:16.533
Neglect?

22:16.600 --> 22:18.933
We'll certainly
talk about that...

22:19.067 --> 22:20.867
No, nothing on
Krista yet.

22:20.933 --> 22:23.233
I'm actually at
Diane's right now.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.700
Listen, do you want
me to pick up dinner?

22:25.767 --> 22:28.400
You're a good man.
See you later.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.567
Allison?

22:42.633 --> 22:45.133
I came to pick up the
pictures of Krista.

22:45.200 --> 22:51.167
I... I don't know
where they are.

22:51.233 --> 22:54.633
I need the pictures so
that I can distribute them.

22:54.700 --> 22:57.100
To find Krista.

23:01.300 --> 23:04.300
Diane!

23:06.367 --> 23:11.333
I... I was so tired,
I wanted to take a nap.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.200
So I took a sleeping pill,

23:13.267 --> 23:15.833
and then I got up off the couch
to go to the bathroom,

23:15.900 --> 23:18.433
and I tripped
on a wrinkle in the rug

23:18.500 --> 23:20.267
and fell into the corner
of the china cabinet.

23:20.333 --> 23:22.633
It was just a
stupid accident.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.433
There's....

23:24.500 --> 23:30.067
There's no contusion that
matches the corner of a cabinet.

23:30.100 --> 23:31.700
What?

23:31.767 --> 23:33.733
Diane.

23:33.800 --> 23:37.333
I want you to be
honest with me.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.733
Did Charlie do this to you?

23:39.800 --> 23:41.667
Allison,
don't be ridiculous.

23:41.733 --> 23:43.833
I'm a klutz, that's all.

23:43.900 --> 23:46.200
There are steps we can
take to make sure you're safe.

23:46.267 --> 23:47.767
Allison, really.

23:47.833 --> 23:50.200
You're turning this
into something it isn't.

23:50.267 --> 23:51.867
Where's Charlie now?

23:51.933 --> 23:55.100
He's upset about Krista,
he went out.

23:55.167 --> 23:59.800
For a drink?

23:59.867 --> 24:02.667
Has Charlie hurt Krista?

24:02.733 --> 24:06.633
Allison, you know us
better than that.

24:06.700 --> 24:09.900
Your cop imagination
is working overtime.

24:09.967 --> 24:13.067
Thank you for coming over.

24:13.133 --> 24:14.800
I appreciate it.

24:14.867 --> 24:16.933
But I really need
to get some sleep.

24:17.067 --> 24:19.833
I could just stay and
have Devin come pick this up--

24:19.900 --> 24:22.700
No, please go.

24:25.467 --> 24:28.233
Okay.

24:29.100 --> 24:33.667
I'll call you the minute
I have anything, okay?

24:36.467 --> 24:39.200
Diane tried to tell
me it was an accident,

24:39.267 --> 24:42.433
but Charlie hit her, Matt.

24:42.500 --> 24:45.200
She probably can't
even admit it to herself.

24:45.267 --> 24:47.433
But they're our friends,
people we care about.

24:47.500 --> 24:50.067
How could we not
know this was going on?

24:50.100 --> 24:52.433
Because we assumed
they're like us.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.400
We don't go around
thinking that our friends

24:54.467 --> 24:56.467
are hiding some
big dark secret.

24:56.533 --> 24:58.767
We have to get
them some help.

24:58.833 --> 25:02.067
You mean we need to get
them to accept some help.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.267
Iif abuse is happening
in that house,

25:04.333 --> 25:07.533
then maybe Krista went
with Brent willingly.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.400
As an escape or something.

25:09.467 --> 25:13.133
I don't mean to add to
your list of worries,

25:13.200 --> 25:16.267
but we really need
to talk about Mariah.

25:22.133 --> 25:25.967
Nothing left
of me but bone?

25:26.067 --> 25:28.767
No wonder Ms. Lowens
was worried.

25:28.833 --> 25:31.100
But Mariah doesn't
seem depressed.

25:31.167 --> 25:33.433
Or am I missing
that, too?

25:33.500 --> 25:35.267
She may be expressing
something in those poems,

25:35.333 --> 25:37.167
that she's not expressing
with us, I don't know.

25:37.233 --> 25:39.600
I think we have to have
a conversation with her

25:39.667 --> 25:42.800
and be frank about what things
are like with Tim and Jackie,

25:42.867 --> 25:44.433
and then we can
take it from there.

25:44.500 --> 25:45.567
Yeah, okay.

25:45.633 --> 25:47.067
We should just talk
to her together.

25:48.933 --> 25:50.200
Who could that be?

25:50.267 --> 25:52.067
I'll check.

25:58.100 --> 26:02.967
Allison McLean! You mind
your own damn business!

26:06.400 --> 26:08.900
Where is she?

26:09.067 --> 26:10.067
She's upstairs.

26:10.067 --> 26:12.267
You get her down
here right now.

26:12.333 --> 26:15.767
She's ruining my family,
and she will answer for that.

26:15.833 --> 26:17.133
You're drunk, Charlie.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.300
I suggest you sleep it
off and then we'll talk.

26:19.367 --> 26:21.533
My wife locked me
out of my house

26:21.600 --> 26:24.933
because your wife is
telling her lies about me.

26:25.067 --> 26:27.700
You can walk to the
Crestview Inn from here.

26:27.867 --> 26:30.733
You get that nosy cop of
yours down here right now.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.967
She owes me an apology.

26:33.067 --> 26:34.700
Nobody owes you anything,
except maybe a taste

26:34.767 --> 26:36.833
of what you've
been dishing out.

26:36.900 --> 26:38.733
Allison's gonna put a patrol
car on your house tonight.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.700
You leave your wife alone,
you leave my wife alone,

26:41.767 --> 26:43.900
and you pull yourself
together, Charlie.

26:43.967 --> 26:45.200
This is all
Allison's fault.

26:45.267 --> 26:47.600
No, this is your
fault pal.

26:47.667 --> 26:51.267
Crestview Inn.
Two blocks. Go ahead.

26:54.867 --> 26:58.133
Get control of
your woman, Matt.

27:00.600 --> 27:07.300
Tell her to find my daughter
and leave my wife alone.

27:20.967 --> 27:22.900
Okay gang,
have a great day.

27:22.967 --> 27:24.467
Can you ask
Mom to text me

27:24.533 --> 27:26.067
if she learns
anything about Krista?

27:26.067 --> 27:26.967
Yeah sure.

27:27.067 --> 27:28.367
Thanks.

27:28.433 --> 27:29.900
Mariah, remember,

27:29.967 --> 27:32.567
your aunt and I want to talk
to you after school, okay?

27:32.633 --> 27:35.233
Yeah, no problem.

27:42.533 --> 27:45.800
What'd she do?

27:47.667 --> 27:50.900
I need you to be
honest with me, okay?

27:52.500 --> 27:54.800
Were you and
Mariah ever afraid

27:54.867 --> 27:57.067
when you were living with
your mom and dad?

27:57.100 --> 28:00.533
What do you mean?

28:00.600 --> 28:03.200
Mariah's been writing
some poems for English

28:03.267 --> 28:04.700
that are a little
troublesome.

28:04.767 --> 28:08.133
Her teacher was worried
maybe there are things

28:08.200 --> 28:13.300
that she or maybe both of
you should talk through.

28:13.367 --> 28:16.267
Your aunt and I
are worried, too.

28:16.333 --> 28:18.667
Mom and Dad took care of
us the best they could.

28:18.733 --> 28:20.367
Better than they took
care of themselves.

28:20.433 --> 28:22.633
Mariah's making junk up.

28:22.700 --> 28:25.100
Why would she do that?

28:25.167 --> 28:28.200
We just want to
help, Cam.

28:28.267 --> 28:30.433
What do you think
is going on?

28:30.500 --> 28:33.067
I'll find out.

28:42.367 --> 28:44.967
Still no activity on
Krista's credit card.

28:45.067 --> 28:46.967
You getting anything with
Brent's bank statements?

28:47.067 --> 28:50.500
Nothing unusual...
not much activity at all.

28:50.567 --> 28:53.200
No wonder he raided
his mom's cookie jar.

28:53.267 --> 28:56.267
I'm going back through
Krista's bank account now.

28:58.900 --> 29:03.067
Since Charlie is abusive,
I'm wondering if

29:03.067 --> 29:06.333
Krista's disappearance
is less spontaneous

29:06.400 --> 29:08.100
than we've been thinking.

29:08.167 --> 29:11.333
More of a planned escape?

29:11.400 --> 29:14.133
Yeah. Instead of charges
and withdrawals in the last

29:14.200 --> 29:16.567
day or two, maybe
they've been saving up.

29:16.633 --> 29:18.233
Hang on.

29:18.300 --> 29:20.433
Krista withdrew
four hundred dollars

29:20.500 --> 29:22.600
from an ATM
three weeks ago.

29:22.667 --> 29:26.067
But not the one by her
house that she typically uses.

29:26.100 --> 29:30.067
This ATM's
downtown, east side.

29:30.100 --> 29:32.500
Why so far away?

29:35.300 --> 29:38.467
Excuse me, we're looking for
two missing kids,

29:38.533 --> 29:39.800
a boy and a girl.

29:39.867 --> 29:42.067
She came in a few weeks
ago and used your ATM.

29:42.133 --> 29:43.933
She's too young to buy
what you're selling,

29:44.067 --> 29:45.133
so you should remember her.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.800
I sell other stuff:
soda, candy.

29:48.867 --> 29:50.433
It's a long drive
for a candy bar.

29:50.500 --> 29:53.967
Haven't seen
either one of them.

29:54.067 --> 29:57.067
An underage girl comes
here and spends $400.

29:57.133 --> 29:59.200
Either you tell us
what she wanted,

29:59.267 --> 30:01.533
or we bring a team in here
and sweep through this place

30:01.600 --> 30:06.933
from top to bottom and bust you
on every infraction we find.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.300
My eyes aren't as good
as they used to be.

30:12.233 --> 30:16.600
If I squint, I think maybe
she was in here...

30:16.667 --> 30:18.667
and maybe he
was with her.

30:18.733 --> 30:20.400
And maybe she
bought something?

30:20.467 --> 30:21.333
Maybe.

30:21.400 --> 30:24.833
$400 buys a lot
of maybe.

30:24.900 --> 30:26.867
We're not interested in
charging you with anything.

30:26.933 --> 30:29.133
We just want to find her.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.200
Remember when you
were young,

30:37.267 --> 30:40.433
and you couldn't
wait to grow up?

30:40.500 --> 30:44.867
Maybe she wanted a little
help getting a jump on that.

30:46.733 --> 30:48.633
You sold her a fake ID?

30:48.700 --> 30:50.367
Maybe.

30:50.433 --> 30:52.233
So she wanted to
be 21 for --

30:52.300 --> 30:53.633
No, that's the weird thing.

30:53.700 --> 30:56.167
She only wanted to be 18.

30:56.233 --> 30:58.433
Krista's going to
be 18 in six weeks.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.700
Guess something
couldn't wait.

31:00.767 --> 31:04.233
Maybe, thanks.

31:04.300 --> 31:06.933
So what's so magical
about being 18?

31:07.067 --> 31:09.633
You can't drink and who's
that invested in voting?

31:09.700 --> 31:11.067
You can get married.

31:11.100 --> 31:14.667
Krista and Brent
are eloping.

31:22.300 --> 31:24.100
What's with all
these stupid poems?

31:24.167 --> 31:25.700
They're not stupid.

31:25.767 --> 31:29.333
Ms. Lowens likes them and
one's getting published.

31:29.400 --> 31:32.067
The one about how our parents
neglected and abused us?

31:32.133 --> 31:34.133
What are you
talking about?

31:34.200 --> 31:36.600
Ms. Lowens told Aunt
Allison and Uncle Matt

31:36.667 --> 31:38.133
that you're hiding
some dark secret.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.967
So they think Mom
and Dad neglected us

31:40.067 --> 31:41.300
or some stupid thing.

31:41.367 --> 31:42.600
I was being poetic.

31:42.667 --> 31:44.467
You're grinding our
parents to get attention.

31:44.533 --> 31:46.800
No, I was exploring!

31:46.867 --> 31:48.300
We already have
trouble fitting in.

31:48.367 --> 31:50.833
Why'd you have to
make things worse?

31:54.967 --> 31:56.233
Okay, thank you very much.

31:56.300 --> 31:57.767
Please continue to
be on the lookout.

31:57.833 --> 32:00.133
The sighting in
Bremerton didn't pan out.

32:00.200 --> 32:01.867
Well their pictures have gone
out to the airports

32:01.933 --> 32:03.067
and the border crossings.

32:03.133 --> 32:05.467
Okay, great.

32:10.733 --> 32:12.600
Diane?

32:16.767 --> 32:18.933
Diane, are you all right?

32:26.300 --> 32:29.500
Got it. What happened?

32:32.867 --> 32:35.833
Oh Diane!

32:35.900 --> 32:38.467
I need a response to a
domestic violence incident.

32:38.533 --> 32:40.467
Please, don't do that.

32:40.533 --> 32:41.900
He has to, Diane.

32:41.967 --> 32:43.233
316 Meadow Drive.

32:43.300 --> 32:44.433
Let us help you.

32:44.500 --> 32:47.467
He didn't mean to, he
is under so much stress.

32:47.533 --> 32:49.700
He's so worried about Krista.

32:49.767 --> 32:53.300
Diane.

32:56.167 --> 32:58.700
Okay, walk me
through it.

32:58.767 --> 33:01.200
What set Charlie off?

33:01.267 --> 33:03.767
I got a text from Krista.

33:03.833 --> 33:06.100
It was a photo of
her and that boy.

33:06.167 --> 33:07.433
Brent.

33:07.500 --> 33:10.533
They were on a beach.

33:10.600 --> 33:14.233
The text said:
The happiest place I ever knew

33:14.300 --> 33:16.433
is now even happier!

33:16.500 --> 33:20.967
Newlyweds! I couldn't help
it, I started crying.

33:21.067 --> 33:23.633
Charlie demanded to
know what was going on,

33:23.700 --> 33:27.633
so I told him
Krista had eloped.

33:27.700 --> 33:31.233
He went into a rage,
he started destroying things.

33:31.300 --> 33:34.067
He was hitting me.

33:34.067 --> 33:38.800
I've never seen
him so angry.

33:43.867 --> 33:45.567
What did he do next?

33:45.633 --> 33:48.533
He grabbed my phone and
he looked at the photo.

33:48.600 --> 33:51.700
He said he knew where they
were, and then he took off.

33:51.767 --> 33:54.700
Did you recognize the beach?

33:54.767 --> 33:59.133
No. If I knew, I
would tell you...

33:59.200 --> 34:01.833
The happiest
place I ever knew.

34:01.900 --> 34:04.067
Do you have any
idea what she means?

34:04.133 --> 34:05.433
No.

34:05.500 --> 34:08.700
I don't remember
her being happy.

34:08.767 --> 34:12.233
Isn't that horrible?

34:12.300 --> 34:18.200
You can do this, Diane.
Just think.

34:21.067 --> 34:25.400
The summer that
she was nine.

34:25.467 --> 34:27.367
Go on.

34:27.433 --> 34:29.733
We went on a
family vacation.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.733
To Rialto Beach.

34:31.800 --> 34:35.300
There's a little
inn on the water.

34:35.367 --> 34:39.200
Of course! We still talk about
how perfect that trip was.

34:39.267 --> 34:43.067
Things were so
much better then.

34:43.100 --> 34:45.733
A special team will be
here in three minutes.

34:45.800 --> 34:49.467
You need to go with them. They
will protect you from Charlie.

34:49.533 --> 34:54.533
I don't think I can leave
him... he's all I know.

34:54.600 --> 34:59.433
I know it seems impossible,
but it's a process.

34:59.500 --> 35:02.633
Diane, you
have to do this.

35:22.733 --> 35:25.133
Oh, good. That's our room
service Mrs. White.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.633
That's wonderful,
Mr. White.

35:34.733 --> 35:38.900
Dad?
Daddy, no!

35:40.900 --> 35:42.400
Get out of here,
old man!

35:42.467 --> 35:43.900
My daughter is
coming home with me!

35:43.967 --> 35:45.233
No! I'm his wife!
I'm staying here!

35:45.333 --> 35:46.400
Hey!

35:51.933 --> 35:52.867
Krista, stay back!

35:52.933 --> 35:54.933
He's going
to kill you!

35:56.833 --> 36:00.367
Police!

36:00.433 --> 36:01.700
Get off me!

36:01.767 --> 36:02.467
Brent!

36:02.567 --> 36:04.300
Shut up!

36:04.367 --> 36:08.733
Think you can just
take my daughter?

36:08.800 --> 36:10.767
I need to be
with my husband!

36:10.833 --> 36:12.067
No Krista, listen --

36:12.133 --> 36:13.800
I'm not done with you.

36:13.867 --> 36:15.967
No daddy, we're
done with you.

36:16.067 --> 36:17.867
Brent and I are
our own family now.

36:17.933 --> 36:20.533
And we never have to
see you or listen to you,

36:20.600 --> 36:23.400
or be afraid of you again.

36:23.467 --> 36:27.833
Krista!
This is not the answer.

36:27.900 --> 36:29.700
Krista, just look
at this room

36:29.767 --> 36:32.567
with all its satin and hearts.
It's just a fantasy.

36:32.633 --> 36:34.600
Marriage is much more
complicated than that

36:34.667 --> 36:38.433
and it takes a long time
and work to get it right.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.100
Marriage is more
than just love,

36:40.167 --> 36:41.900
it's about respect
and forgiveness.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.067
And those are things you
haven't learned in your house.

36:44.133 --> 36:45.833
Krista!

36:47.900 --> 36:48.867
Stay out!

36:48.933 --> 36:51.233
Hey! Don't you dare.

36:51.300 --> 36:53.433
You're trading one man
who doesn't respect you

36:53.500 --> 36:56.067
or your mother for another
man who doesn't respect you.

36:56.067 --> 36:57.933
Has he hit you yet?

36:58.067 --> 36:58.933
Hey! You can't --

36:59.067 --> 37:01.267
I can and I will.

37:01.333 --> 37:03.867
We're taking you in, too.

37:10.533 --> 37:13.567
What do I do now?

37:13.633 --> 37:17.467
You start over.
Come here.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.067
It's okay.

37:25.100 --> 37:26.933
It's okay,
it's over.

37:30.567 --> 37:33.067
The hotel management
is filing charges

37:33.067 --> 37:35.167
against Brent and Charlie for
the fight in the suite.

37:35.233 --> 37:38.633
And the marriage wasn't
valid, so it's over.

37:38.700 --> 37:41.200
How's Diane doing?

37:41.267 --> 37:43.367
I don't know.

37:43.433 --> 37:45.667
You don't she'll take
Charlie back, do you?

37:45.733 --> 37:46.800
I don't know.

37:46.867 --> 37:49.133
A week ago, I
would have said...

37:49.200 --> 37:50.867
I don't know what
I would've said,

37:50.933 --> 37:53.500
a week ago, I wouldn't
have believed it.

37:53.567 --> 37:56.100
I just hope they get
the help they need.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.467
You guys said you
wanted to see me?

38:00.533 --> 38:02.833
Yeah.
Come on, sit down.

38:02.900 --> 38:06.167
We want to talk
about your poems.

38:06.233 --> 38:07.967
Yeah, sorry.

38:08.067 --> 38:11.833
I'm starting to realize I was
giving people the wrong idea.

38:11.900 --> 38:14.600
But I was just
being creative.

38:14.667 --> 38:18.167
Mom and Dad have issues,
but they didn't hurt us.

38:19.967 --> 38:22.833
Something must be
bothering you though.

38:32.533 --> 38:35.933
I'm not good
at anything.

38:37.767 --> 38:40.067
Since we got here,
Cameron figured out

38:40.067 --> 38:42.100
he's great at track.

38:42.167 --> 38:47.667
But I haven't
found... anything.

38:47.733 --> 38:50.900
So when Ms. Lowens
liked my poem so much,

38:50.967 --> 38:52.800
it felt amazing.

38:52.867 --> 38:57.267
I just wanted it to
keep feeling amazing.

38:57.333 --> 38:59.633
I think you've found
something you're good at

38:59.700 --> 39:02.467
and we want
to support that.

39:02.533 --> 39:06.067
But if you're sad or hurt
or anything else...

39:06.133 --> 39:08.133
we want to help you.

39:08.200 --> 39:14.733
I'm okay. I'm just figuring
stuff out, you know?

39:14.800 --> 39:16.567
Yeah, well that's going
to keep going

39:16.633 --> 39:19.167
for another couple of
decades.

39:19.233 --> 39:24.100
Just be aware of the
power of what you write.

39:24.167 --> 39:27.767
And know that
we're here for you.

39:27.833 --> 39:32.767
Okay... thanks.

39:32.833 --> 39:34.500
And if you want to keep
expressing yourself

39:34.567 --> 39:37.100
with poetry that's
totally cool too.

39:42.533 --> 39:47.067
I'm really glad
you guys liked my poems.

39:50.900 --> 39:52.633
Think Emily Dickinson ever
had that conversation

39:52.700 --> 39:54.633
with her aunt and uncle?

39:57.533 --> 39:58.533
That's you.

39:58.600 --> 39:59.833
I'll get it!

40:04.767 --> 40:06.667
Diane, Krista.

40:06.733 --> 40:08.133
You're probably
about to eat.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.733
No, it's fine.
Come on in.

40:10.800 --> 40:13.267
We can't stay,
I just wanted...

40:13.333 --> 40:15.200
I needed to
come thank you.

40:15.267 --> 40:17.167
For what you did
for both of us.

40:17.233 --> 40:19.900
Of course, I'm just
glad you're both safe.

40:19.967 --> 40:22.000
So Krista and
I had a big talk.

40:22.067 --> 40:24.100
And now I'm going
to do something

40:24.167 --> 40:26.867
I should have done a
very long time ago.

40:26.933 --> 40:29.800
I'm pressing charges
against Charlie.

40:29.867 --> 40:31.800
And I'm leaving him.

40:31.867 --> 40:34.733
That's a huge step
for both of you.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.900
In case you need to reach me,
we're going to be staying

40:36.967 --> 40:38.933
with my sister in
Chicago for a little while.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.667
Just until we figure
out what to do next, together.

40:42.733 --> 40:44.433
We'll miss you.

40:44.500 --> 40:47.067
Email me, let me know what
you think of Chicago.

40:47.133 --> 40:49.867
Thanks, I will.

40:51.867 --> 40:56.200
Thank you.

40:56.267 --> 40:58.433
You're a good man, Matt.

40:58.500 --> 41:01.967
Take care of
yourself, Diane.

41:02.067 --> 41:06.167
Bye.

41:18.500 --> 41:19.400
Hungry?

41:19.467 --> 41:20.467
Yes.

41:24.600 --> 41:29.167
Before we eat, I was wondering
if I could read my new poem?

41:29.233 --> 41:30.467
Of course.

41:30.533 --> 41:33.900
We'd love to hear it.

41:36.833 --> 41:42.567
It's called Family.

41:42.633 --> 41:45.367
A house is made up
of many rooms

41:45.433 --> 41:47.667
and every room
is different.

41:47.733 --> 41:50.133
Some are small and cozy.

41:50.200 --> 41:52.833
Others are big and bright.

41:52.900 --> 41:56.067
Some have doors
that never close,

41:56.100 --> 41:59.267
while some are
locked up tight.

41:59.333 --> 42:03.167
But a calming breeze
can find its way through,

42:03.233 --> 42:08.067
and into them all
shines the sun.

42:10.367 --> 42:11.467
That was lovely.

42:11.533 --> 42:13.200
Great job.

42:13.300 --> 42:16.533
I feel the truth.

42:16.600 --> 42:20.800
It's really nice, but I
kind of miss the rats.
