00:28.335 --> 00:31.781
- Oh, man.
- Hi, Dewey. Did you miss me?

00:32.545 --> 00:34.763
Come on.
Get off the bike.

00:34.798 --> 00:38.260
Arrest me, do whatever you want with
me, just don't touch the bike. Come on.

00:38.295 --> 00:40.044
You skipped out on your
assault hearing yesterday.

00:40.079 --> 00:41.597
You made our captain
very, very angry.

00:41.632 --> 00:43.776
Well, you tell Stottlemeyer
he can kiss my ass.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.879
You can tell him yourself.
He'll be here any second.

00:45.914 --> 00:47.225
Come on, you know the routine.
Put your hands on the car.

00:47.260 --> 00:48.971
- God
- Come on.

00:49.604 --> 00:51.445
Haven't you guys got
anything better to do?

01:00.366 --> 01:01.394
What about my bike?

01:01.429 --> 01:02.990
You're not going to just
leave it there, are you?

01:03.025 --> 01:05.260
- You know, I think I'll take it for a
ride. - Don't do that. Don't ride...

01:05.856 --> 01:09.538
what is this, a heritage softail?
80-incher?

01:09.573 --> 01:11.395
I always wanted to ride
one of these.

01:15.129 --> 01:17.930
Hey, Coop.
This guy giving you any trouble?

01:19.510 --> 01:21.797
- Get down!
- I can't see him!

01:21.832 --> 01:24.650
We're taking fire!
We need help!

01:24.685 --> 01:25.910
Get down!

01:25.945 --> 01:29.265
Shots have been fired on the corner
of Fulton and Drake! Officers need help!

01:29.300 --> 01:32.622
- Where is he? Where is he?
- Look up at the windows!

01:32.647 --> 01:34.488
- He's probably in the building.
- you see him?

01:38.986 --> 01:41.494
- Everybody okay?
- Lock the street down!

01:41.529 --> 01:42.707
Captain, you see him?

01:42.742 --> 01:44.166
Captain?

01:45.995 --> 01:47.205
Officer down!

01:47.240 --> 01:49.701
Blue paramedics!
Officer down!

01:51.211 --> 01:53.479
MONK Season 3 Epi. 09
Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine

02:54.940 --> 02:56.869
So how was your weekend?

03:00.848 --> 03:03.742
This is not the life I wanted.

03:04.528 --> 03:06.690
It's unbearable.

03:07.341 --> 03:09.882
You know that...

03:09.917 --> 03:12.506
I envy...

03:13.246 --> 03:14.953
everybody.

03:14.988 --> 03:17.668
Strangers, people on the street.

03:20.417 --> 03:23.856
Maybe they envy you.
You're an extraordinary man.

03:23.891 --> 03:27.112
Yeah, I don't want to be
an extraordinary man.

03:27.147 --> 03:29.848
I want to be the guy on the bus

03:29.883 --> 03:32.931
coming home at 5:00

03:32.966 --> 03:36.024
to help his kids with their homework.
Where's the trash?

03:36.059 --> 03:38.348
It's over there, but you can,
you can just put it down there.

03:38.383 --> 03:42.728
Just put it right there.
It's fine. Good.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.505
Good.

03:46.502 --> 03:48.884
That's really good.

03:48.919 --> 03:50.866
I'm just so tired...

03:51.970 --> 03:56.180
so tired of being... me.

03:58.387 --> 04:00.414
For example,

04:00.449 --> 04:02.053
that tissue..

04:02.845 --> 04:05.382
I know, I know it's crazy...

04:06.512 --> 04:10.058
right now, that's...
all I can think about.

04:10.093 --> 04:15.676
Adrian, let's not make this
about the tissue.

04:15.711 --> 04:17.353
You know...

04:17.387 --> 04:18.978
sometimes late at night,

04:21.333 --> 04:23.501
I start to think...

04:25.291 --> 04:28.169
that I never really...

04:30.410 --> 04:32.247
Oh, forget it.

04:41.046 --> 04:43.580
Look at me.
I'm, I'm helpless.

04:43.615 --> 04:45.995
I'm, I'm pathetic.

04:46.519 --> 04:49.082
I'm not even a man.
I'm just a...

04:49.622 --> 04:51.975
I'm just a broken machine.

04:54.368 --> 04:57.122
All right, look, Adrian,
maybe I can help you.

04:57.157 --> 04:58.887
I know how you feel
about medication.

04:58.922 --> 05:01.077
No, no, no.

05:01.112 --> 05:03.985
No pharmaceuticals.
We talked about this.

05:04.020 --> 05:08.613
Yes, we did talk about that, but there is
a new drug that's just been approved.

05:08.648 --> 05:11.885
It's called doxinyl, and the side
effects are supposed to be minimal,

05:11.920 --> 05:15.286
and I really think that
it might help in your case.

05:15.321 --> 05:16.621
I can't do it.

05:16.656 --> 05:21.935
The thought of chemicals
inside me, in my head...

05:22.653 --> 05:25.148
- I can't do it.
- All right, we can take it slow.

05:25.183 --> 05:27.810
We can start off with,
with half a dose.

05:27.845 --> 05:30.071
All right, look.
Uh...

05:30.106 --> 05:33.564
This, this is enough
for one week, and it's...

05:36.389 --> 05:39.133
This is enough for one week, okay?

05:39.168 --> 05:40.867
So you keep those with you.

05:40.902 --> 05:42.988
If you're feeling
overwhelmed, take one,

05:43.023 --> 05:46.811
but call me so that I can
just monitor your reaction.

05:48.487 --> 05:50.891
- I can't do it.
- Nobody is forcing you, Adrian.

05:50.926 --> 05:53.092
Keep them with you,
just in case.

05:53.127 --> 05:55.757
Adrian! I, I'm sorry.
I know I'm interrupting, but...

05:55.792 --> 05:58.859
- Sharona.
- Stottlemeyer's been shot.

06:01.459 --> 06:04.211
Taylor, make sure that street
is shut down. - Yes, sir.

06:04.246 --> 06:06.717
- We got guys going door to door?
- Huh-uh. - Good.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.141
Are there cameras on these
traffic lights? - Yes, sir.

06:09.176 --> 06:12.192
All right, check them out.
Maybe they caught something.

06:12.227 --> 06:14.640
Hey, I want you to get
pictures of this crowd.

06:14.675 --> 06:17.185
The shooter might still
be here. All right?

06:17.941 --> 06:21.177
Please get me another
forensics team down here now!

06:22.061 --> 06:24.027
Randy! How is he?

06:24.062 --> 06:25.691
I don't know. He took one
in the shoulder.

06:25.726 --> 06:27.870
He's in the hospital now.

06:27.905 --> 06:29.737
So tell me what you need.

06:29.772 --> 06:31.751
Look, I don't know what I need.
I'm barely holding it together here.

06:31.786 --> 06:33.451
No, you're doing great.
He'd be proud of you.

06:33.486 --> 06:37.291
- So what, what happened?
- Okay.

06:37.326 --> 06:38.795
Okay, we're shaking down a biker.

06:38.830 --> 06:40.876
Lieutenant Cooper's over
here by the bike.

06:40.911 --> 06:43.204
The captain and I drive up,
we get out of the car,

06:43.239 --> 06:46.545
bam, eight shots, eight shots..
Nine, I don't know, Monk.

06:46.580 --> 06:50.342
From, from where? - From one of
these windows, maybe. I mean...

06:50.377 --> 06:52.174
Maybe that one.

06:52.209 --> 06:54.842
I was behind the car.
I didn't see anything. - Yeah.

06:55.429 --> 06:57.389
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

06:57.424 --> 07:01.159
It wasn't from up there.
No, no, it was, it was from ground level.

07:01.194 --> 07:04.423
It was from the street,
maybe, maybe from a car.

07:04.860 --> 07:07.205
- Who got here first?
- Hensley and Salvatore.

07:07.240 --> 07:09.493
- Hensley!, Sal!
- Yes, sir.

07:09.528 --> 07:12.097
Hensley, tell him what
you just told me.

07:12.132 --> 07:15.245
We were four blocks away. There was
a suicide over on Vinton avenue.

07:15.280 --> 07:18.306
A woman went belly-flopping
off her balcony in her bathrobe.

07:18.341 --> 07:20.077
We were waiting for the coroner
when the call came in.

07:20.112 --> 07:21.627
We dropped everything
and came running.

07:21.662 --> 07:24.536
Okay, the shooter might
have been in a car.

07:24.571 --> 07:26.801
- Did you see anything?
- As we were driving up,

07:26.836 --> 07:28.518
we did see a guy making a U-turn.

07:28.553 --> 07:30.717
- What, what kind of car?
- Midsize.

07:30.752 --> 07:32.838
- Color, color, color.
- It might have been blue.

07:32.873 --> 07:34.430
It was two blocks up on Fulton.

07:34.465 --> 07:36.358
He turned around and
headed back this way.

07:36.393 --> 07:38.431
It could have been a bystander
or a witness, Monk.

07:38.466 --> 07:39.517
No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:39.552 --> 07:43.691
This guy drove back toward the shots,
not away from the shots.

07:43.726 --> 07:45.147
Did you get a look at him?

07:45.182 --> 07:47.341
I think he may have
made a left turn up here.

07:48.775 --> 07:50.976
Away from the highway.

07:51.011 --> 07:53.164
- What's down there?
- Reservoir.

07:53.199 --> 07:55.371
- Water. He dumped the gun.
- He dumped the gun.

07:55.406 --> 07:58.060
Get me a team of divers. I need a
team of divers down at the reservoir.

07:58.095 --> 07:59.713
Meet me there. Now. Go.

07:59.748 --> 08:01.470
I don't understand.
Why shoot the captain?

08:01.505 --> 08:03.408
- Some cop hater?
- No, no, no, he's a friend of Dewey's,

08:03.443 --> 08:04.752
trying to keep him out of jail.

08:04.787 --> 08:08.494
Well, you can ask Dewey yourself when you
see him. - Monk, he's halfway to Mexico.

08:08.529 --> 08:12.055
- I don't know. Look.
- What's this?

08:12.090 --> 08:14.944
Gas leak. He's got a gas leak.
He's got a gas leak.

08:14.979 --> 08:18.072
Start checking gas stations, garages.
He did not get far.

08:18.107 --> 08:20.263
Dewey Alber,
that's who we want.

08:20.298 --> 08:23.116
- Thank you.
- He's my captain, too.

08:26.745 --> 08:29.609
Okay, watch yourselves,
watch each other. Be ready.

08:31.851 --> 08:33.888
- What do you got?
- Well, he's in there.

08:33.923 --> 08:36.248
- He's working on his bike.
- Alone? - Yeah.

08:36.283 --> 08:40.119
Let's take him now. Three go in
with me, two go around the back.

08:40.154 --> 08:41.719
Monk, stay here.

08:41.754 --> 08:43.303
Let's go.

08:46.789 --> 08:49.593
- Thanks a lot. Bye.
- What? What, what did they say?

08:49.628 --> 08:52.719
Well, they removed the bullets, and
he's out of surgery, okay? - Really?

08:52.754 --> 08:56.943
Yes. You'll be driving him crazy
again in no time. - Thank god.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.019
Hey.

08:59.054 --> 09:00.654
I know you and Stottlemeyer
go way back.

09:00.689 --> 09:03.935
Oh, yeah, we first met two weeks
after I made detective.

09:03.970 --> 09:05.517
He was my fourth partner.

09:05.552 --> 09:07.218
You had three partners
in two weeks?

09:07.253 --> 09:09.736
Aah, they were all
nice enough guys,

09:09.771 --> 09:12.198
but we just didn't really
click, you know?

09:13.232 --> 09:15.041
Hard to believe.

09:17.371 --> 09:18.838
Oh, my god!

09:19.782 --> 09:21.357
Adrian, get him!

09:21.651 --> 09:23.788
Get him! Get him!

09:25.759 --> 09:28.041
- Hey, what is wrong with you?
- Disher in foot pursuit!

09:28.076 --> 09:30.122
Code three!
You had him.

09:32.814 --> 09:34.331
Here.
Here.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.254
I had him. I...
I had him. I...

09:36.289 --> 09:39.259
It was, it wasn't your fault.

09:39.294 --> 09:42.261
Yes, it was.
It always is.

10:38.252 --> 10:39.582
Hello, Adrian.

10:42.436 --> 10:45.313
You're not still smelling
my pillow, are you?

10:46.652 --> 10:48.806
You can't really smell me
on that old thing.

10:48.841 --> 10:50.495
Sure I can.

10:50.530 --> 10:54.413
It's your strawberry shampoo and

10:54.448 --> 10:57.217
the lilac lotion you always wore.

10:57.252 --> 10:59.899
You never even liked that lotion.

10:59.934 --> 11:03.256
I love it now.

11:03.291 --> 11:05.801
I love it now.

11:07.283 --> 11:08.741
Trudy...

11:09.979 --> 11:11.652
it's so hard.

11:11.687 --> 11:14.688
- I know it is.
- I screwed up bad.

11:14.723 --> 11:18.398
I let a suspect run right by me.

11:18.433 --> 11:20.783
You're doing the best you can.

11:21.698 --> 11:25.967
I am so... so proud of you.

11:26.864 --> 11:30.664
Dr. Kroger gave me some pills.

11:30.699 --> 11:34.283
He said they might help.

11:35.641 --> 11:37.534
But I'm afraid.

11:37.569 --> 11:42.003
- What are you afraid of?
- I'm afraid of... change.

11:42.860 --> 11:45.383
And I'm afraid of not changing.

11:45.418 --> 11:47.637
I'm afraid of change,

11:47.672 --> 11:50.887
and I'm afraid of... not changing.

11:56.972 --> 11:58.859
What do you think?

12:02.190 --> 12:04.525
I want you to be happy.

12:06.448 --> 12:08.363
That's all I've ever wanted.

12:09.498 --> 12:12.582
Be happy, my darling.

12:16.289 --> 12:18.332
You deserve it.

13:49.514 --> 13:51.752
- I think it's down here.
- I don't know.

13:52.753 --> 13:55.060
- What?
- Your button.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.618
What about it?

13:56.653 --> 13:58.747
It's, it's not buttoned.
You always button it up.

13:58.782 --> 14:01.096
Oh, how'd that happen?

14:01.265 --> 14:02.355
I don't know.
Are you okay?

14:02.390 --> 14:03.886
Yeah, I'm fine.
Here it is.

14:05.125 --> 14:08.503
I don't know.
I haven't tried walking.

14:08.538 --> 14:10.987
- Yeah.
- Hi. How you doing?

14:11.022 --> 14:13.245
I'm mad as hell.
Hey, Mikey?

14:13.280 --> 14:15.915
I got, I got visitors.
Keep me posted.

14:15.950 --> 14:18.129
There he is.
There he is.

14:18.164 --> 14:21.543
- It's good to see you.
- What are you doing? Sharona.

14:21.578 --> 14:22.828
- I, I don't know.
- Good to see you.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.542
Oh, my god.
What have you heard?

14:24.577 --> 14:26.797
- What do you mean?
- He never hugs anybody.

14:26.832 --> 14:28.431
- What's wrong with me?
- Nothing. Nothing.

14:28.466 --> 14:30.600
Adrian, Adrian,
come on.

14:30.635 --> 14:32.597
There's nothing wrong.
We just talked to your doctor,

14:32.632 --> 14:35.291
and you're going to be
out in a few days. You're fine.

14:35.326 --> 14:36.780
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:38.772 --> 14:42.079
- So who was that on the phone?
- Captain Hadley.

14:42.114 --> 14:44.243
They caught Dewey Alber,
my biker buddy.

14:44.278 --> 14:46.389
He was hiding out at his
girlfriend's apartment.

14:46.424 --> 14:49.543
- See? Told you they'd find him.
- Well, it's a dead end.

14:49.578 --> 14:51.279
He passed a polygraph test.

14:51.314 --> 14:53.442
He didn't have anything to
do with my getting shot.

14:53.477 --> 14:54.653
He was just running for his life.

14:54.688 --> 14:57.237
Well, if it wasn't Dewey,
who was it, and why?

14:57.272 --> 14:59.028
I was just wondering
the same thing.

14:59.063 --> 15:01.092
Are you going to finish that?

15:01.127 --> 15:02.923
No, you can throw this out.

15:07.750 --> 15:11.402
- Monk, I just took a bite of that.
- Mmm, it's good, isn't it?

15:13.559 --> 15:15.889
I'm hungry.
Is that a crime?

15:15.924 --> 15:16.863
Captain.

15:17.381 --> 15:18.711
Hey.

15:20.185 --> 15:22.621
We found the weapon.
It was in the reservoir.

15:22.656 --> 15:24.366
Thank you very much, Mr. Monk.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.610
It's a Kregmer.45.
Ballistics match.

15:26.645 --> 15:29.454
- It's definitely the same gun.
- Anything else?

15:29.489 --> 15:33.337
Yeah, guess who it was registered to,
the jumper. - What jumper?

15:33.372 --> 15:35.582
The woman who took a swan dive
out of her apartment

15:35.617 --> 15:37.712
five blocks away just
before the shooting.

15:37.747 --> 15:39.629
Her name's Marlene highsmith.

15:39.664 --> 15:42.652
No, I meant, is there
anything else to eat?

15:42.687 --> 15:45.844
Oh. The pudding's got
my name on it.

15:47.431 --> 15:51.099
- Did you bump your head?
- No. Did you?

15:56.691 --> 15:59.009
Oh, to hell with this.
I'm outta here.

15:59.044 --> 16:01.237
Captain, they haven't released
you yet. Just...

16:02.241 --> 16:04.433
Okay, you know what?
I'm just going out in the hallway.

16:04.468 --> 16:06.391
Randy, there's a guy
out there shooting cops.

16:06.426 --> 16:09.903
Sir, just take it slow,
then, please.

16:09.938 --> 16:12.811
- I got to get a look at that apartment.
- What apartment?

16:12.846 --> 16:15.944
Marlene highsmith's.
She owned the gun that shot the captain.

16:15.979 --> 16:17.674
Oh, yeah. Move out.

16:19.107 --> 16:20.989
Smoke them if you got them.

16:21.024 --> 16:24.094
She landed right here
in a bathrobe.

16:24.129 --> 16:25.664
Splat, huh?

16:26.715 --> 16:28.062
Uh-huh.

16:28.097 --> 16:30.797
- This was at 12:05?
- Yes, sir, 12:05.

16:30.832 --> 16:34.095
We've got five witnesses who saw
her on the ledge just before she jumped.

16:34.130 --> 16:36.595
- Was she alone?
- We're not sure.

16:36.630 --> 16:38.386
That's gotta hurt.

16:38.421 --> 16:40.651
- What is your problem?
- What is your problem?

16:40.686 --> 16:43.052
We got here five minutes later,
at 12:10 exactly.

16:43.087 --> 16:45.268
We were securing the area,
about to head upstairs.

16:45.303 --> 16:47.264
That's when we got your call,
"officer down."

16:47.299 --> 16:48.532
There was a meter maid nearby.

16:48.567 --> 16:50.854
We asked her to stay with
the body, and we took off.

16:50.889 --> 16:53.629
- Any questions?
- No. No, I'm fine.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.331
Why don't you take a look upstairs?

16:57.230 --> 16:59.301
Why don't you take a look upstairs?

17:00.202 --> 17:01.718
- Get out of here.
- Let's go.

17:07.665 --> 17:11.217
Sorry I'm late. - You should have called or
something. I'm jumping out of my skin here.

17:13.667 --> 17:15.013
I heard about Marlene.

17:16.228 --> 17:19.047
That's tough. - I guess she
won't be asking for her share.

17:19.726 --> 17:21.465
It'll make the math a lot easier.

17:21.501 --> 17:23.479
How can you joke about it?
It's your own wife.

17:23.513 --> 17:25.355
Ex-wife.

17:25.390 --> 17:28.511
She's probably happier,
wherever she is.

17:28.546 --> 17:31.030
I'm going to miss her,
especially on Friday.

17:31.065 --> 17:32.523
She was the driver.

17:32.558 --> 17:35.777
You can drive.
It's easy. Drive fast.

17:35.812 --> 17:38.373
If we're being followed, drive faster.

17:38.408 --> 17:41.796
- What about the second guard?
- Leave him to me.

17:41.831 --> 17:43.582
Relax.

17:43.617 --> 17:45.844
The plan is rock solid,
even with two people.

17:45.879 --> 17:49.254
Me and Marlene pulled off the same
thing in Cincinnati without any help.

17:49.289 --> 17:51.210
As long as nobody gets hurt.

17:53.197 --> 17:56.158
You understand I'm
shooting the second guard.

17:56.193 --> 17:57.767
I'm going to kill him.

17:57.802 --> 18:01.263
Yeah, I mean, as, as long
as we don't get hurt.

18:02.443 --> 18:06.137
- I'm going to need another gun.
- What happened to your piece?

18:06.172 --> 18:07.899
I had to dump it.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.510
- Was the door locked?
- Yes, ma'am.

18:13.545 --> 18:15.584
The cops didn't get here
till after dinner.

18:15.619 --> 18:18.447
They were busy down the street.
Some detective got shot.

18:18.482 --> 18:20.630
Yeah, we heard about that.

18:20.665 --> 18:23.021
Guess it all hits the
fan at once sometimes.

18:23.056 --> 18:24.796
What hits the fan?

18:25.956 --> 18:27.431
It.

18:28.726 --> 18:30.475
Ah. Ah. It.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.430
It hits the fan.

18:35.756 --> 18:38.149
- How long did she live here?
- Almost three years.

18:38.184 --> 18:39.927
- I know what "it" means.
- What was she like?

18:39.962 --> 18:42.068
She paid her rent,
kept to herself.

18:42.103 --> 18:45.773
You know, like, "nice day,"
"good morning." That's all I know.

18:45.808 --> 18:47.649
Mr. Monk, she left a note.

18:48.369 --> 18:50.351
They found it over there
on the kitchen table.

18:50.386 --> 18:54.197
"The pain is too much.
I am so sorry. Marlene."

18:54.730 --> 18:56.738
There's something
wrong with this note.

18:56.773 --> 18:58.944
- What?
- I don't know.

19:03.793 --> 19:05.219
Hey.

19:05.636 --> 19:07.931
Are you getting enough
sleep? - Me?

19:07.966 --> 19:10.178
- Yes, you.
- Yeah, I'm fine. Never felt better.

19:10.213 --> 19:13.059
These nuts are great.
Are these organic?

19:13.094 --> 19:14.463
What are you doing?

19:14.498 --> 19:16.771
- What do you mean?
- The captain's been shot.

19:18.455 --> 19:20.353
You're right.

19:20.388 --> 19:22.228
You're right.

19:22.263 --> 19:23.983
Here we go.

19:59.878 --> 20:04.800
Unbelievable. It's some kind of
pecan hybrid or something.

20:37.515 --> 20:40.259
- What?
- I got nothing.

20:41.129 --> 20:42.217
What do you mean?

20:42.252 --> 20:44.882
I mean I got nothing.
I'm dry. It happens.

20:45.546 --> 20:47.919
No, it doesn't.
Not to you.

20:47.954 --> 20:50.682
Hey, back off.
You can't rush the Monk.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.140
The monk?

20:52.698 --> 20:55.149
- Adrian, what's going on?
- What do you mean?

20:55.910 --> 20:57.535
Come over here.

20:59.831 --> 21:01.200
Hey.

21:02.325 --> 21:04.127
Are you on something?

21:07.912 --> 21:10.127
- What's this?
- It's called doxinyl.

21:10.162 --> 21:13.045
Dr. Kroger gave them to me.
He is a genius.

21:14.082 --> 21:16.928
- You're taking this?
- Yeah. They're great. You want one?

21:16.963 --> 21:18.766
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm your nurse.

21:18.801 --> 21:21.642
This is why, because I knew
you'd bring me down.

21:21.677 --> 21:23.513
You're bringing
the Monk down, man.

21:23.548 --> 21:26.126
Okay, you know what?
The Monk and I are going to talk later,

21:26.161 --> 21:28.432
but right now, everybody
is counting on you.

21:28.870 --> 21:32.180
Now, we are in the
apartment of the woman

21:32.215 --> 21:34.305
who owned the gun
that shot the captain.

21:34.340 --> 21:35.477
Do you understand?

21:35.512 --> 21:39.023
I know, I know, I know.
It's a conundrum.

21:40.898 --> 21:43.608
Conundrum. Conun..
conundrum.

21:44.204 --> 21:46.038
Conundrum.
That's a funny word.

21:49.858 --> 21:51.304
Excuse me.

21:51.945 --> 21:53.839
- Is this her?
- Yes, ma'am.

21:53.874 --> 21:55.417
- Who's he?
- Ex-husband.

21:55.452 --> 21:58.676
Lester highsmith, 38.
Divorced a year.

21:58.711 --> 22:01.992
He's a security guard, works at an armored
car company in Diamond Heights.

22:02.027 --> 22:04.721
- What do you think?
- About what?

22:04.756 --> 22:07.968
- The ex-husband.
- Absolutely. The ex-husband.

22:08.003 --> 22:09.664
Let's check him out.

22:09.699 --> 22:11.683
God, these are good.

22:11.718 --> 22:13.942
Okay, the Monk needs
a little fresh air.

22:13.977 --> 22:17.017
I will see you cats
and kittens outside.

22:19.225 --> 22:20.891
Who the hell was that?

22:34.945 --> 22:36.948
Welcome to Rocket burger.
May I help you?

22:36.983 --> 22:38.755
Yeah, uh, yeah, listen,

22:38.790 --> 22:41.714
I, I've lived down the street
for, like, 12 years.

22:41.749 --> 22:43.661
I've never been
in here. - Okay.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.809
- So what's good?
- That's the menu.

22:47.343 --> 22:48.708
Ah, pictures.

22:48.743 --> 22:51.337
- Rocket burger, what's that?
- A hamburger.

22:51.372 --> 22:54.274
And, uh, is it good? I mean,
do people like it, regular people?

22:54.309 --> 22:56.681
It's popular.

22:58.421 --> 22:59.953
Super rocket, what's that?

22:59.988 --> 23:02.767
It's bigger, and it has secret sauce.

23:03.188 --> 23:05.315
Secret sauce. Fantastic.

23:05.350 --> 23:07.293
- What's in that?
- They don't tell us.

23:07.328 --> 23:09.107
So it's like a mystery.

23:09.142 --> 23:11.248
Uh, the Monk loves mysteries.
I'm a detective.

23:11.283 --> 23:14.575
- I think it's just Russian dressing.
- Oh, man...

23:14.610 --> 23:16.446
- you just ruined it for me.
- Sorry.

23:16.481 --> 23:18.368
Why'd you do that?

23:18.403 --> 23:20.959
It's no fun now, is it?

23:20.994 --> 23:23.338
You're bringing
the Monk down, man.

23:23.373 --> 23:25.433
You're bringing us all down.

23:31.512 --> 23:33.394
Isn't this great?

23:33.429 --> 23:35.473
- What's that?
- Oh, just this.

23:35.508 --> 23:38.990
people, hamburgers, condiments...

23:39.025 --> 23:43.218
us, you know?
Just two. two regular guys.

23:53.276 --> 23:58.074
- How's your super rocket?
- It's good. Um...

23:58.109 --> 24:00.081
you got a little ketchup
on your shirt there.

24:00.116 --> 24:01.698
Who gives a crap?
I don't.

24:01.733 --> 24:03.714
That is a weird case.

24:03.749 --> 24:06.494
You know, there was a suicide five blocks
away three minutes before the shooting.

24:06.529 --> 24:09.087
- Yeah, I hope they get this guy.
- Oh, they'll get him.

24:09.122 --> 24:10.935
Know why?
I'm on the case.

24:10.970 --> 24:12.809
I'm a detective.
Maybe you've heard of me.

24:12.844 --> 24:15.682
Adrian monk.
I'm pretty famous.

24:16.213 --> 24:20.486
I don't want to brag but I
solve a lot of high-profile cases.

24:20.521 --> 24:22.746
Hey, if it's true,
it's not bragging.

24:22.781 --> 24:25.486
- Huh? - Yeah.
- Can I steal that?

24:27.862 --> 24:30.451
My name's Salvatore.
My friends call me Sal.

24:30.486 --> 24:33.047
- Sal? - Yeah.
- What do you do?

24:36.074 --> 24:37.912
- Car salesman.
- 11 years.

24:38.686 --> 24:39.721
What kind of car you drive?

24:39.756 --> 24:42.622
I'm currently between
vehicles, as they say.

24:42.657 --> 24:44.265
Really?

24:44.795 --> 24:46.336
Why are you smiling?

25:13.614 --> 25:16.208
Lester!
Lester!

25:16.243 --> 25:18.198
Lester!

25:18.233 --> 25:19.244
How you doing?

25:20.204 --> 25:21.320
Listen, I talked to Denny.

25:21.355 --> 25:23.960
He can cover Thursday and Friday
if you want to take some time off.

25:23.995 --> 25:24.951
No, I'm good.

25:24.986 --> 25:26.675
Are you sure? They're
pretty heavy days.

25:26.710 --> 25:28.966
Friday, we got that big
federal money transfer.

25:29.423 --> 25:30.805
I'd rather work.

25:30.840 --> 25:32.788
I don't blame you.
I'm the same way.

25:32.823 --> 25:34.794
It's best to stay busy.

25:37.437 --> 25:40.226
- Call him again.
- I've been calling him every 10 minutes.

25:40.261 --> 25:42.271
Well, then try his shrink.

25:42.306 --> 25:45.109
I already did, and he missed
his appointment this morning.

25:45.618 --> 25:50.068
- Has that ever happened?
- No. He never misses anything.

25:50.103 --> 25:52.494
You know, maybe I should
just call the police.

25:52.529 --> 25:54.447
Hey, how's it going?

25:54.482 --> 25:56.233
Oh, man.

25:56.951 --> 25:59.195
- What are you wearing?
- It's a little something called style.

25:59.230 --> 26:01.749
You wouldn't understand.
Where's the captain?

26:01.784 --> 26:03.651
He's signing us in.

26:03.686 --> 26:06.740
- How you doing, toy store?
- What did you call me?

26:06.775 --> 26:09.290
Toy store.
Your name is Disher.

26:09.325 --> 26:11.243
Dish, plate,

26:11.278 --> 26:13.512
plato. Play-doh.

26:13.547 --> 26:16.079
And where do you buy
play-doh? - A toy store.

26:16.114 --> 26:17.267
That's what I'm talking about.

26:17.302 --> 26:21.321
Adrian, you have got to tell
Dr. Kroger to adjust your dosage.

26:21.356 --> 26:22.896
My dosage is fine.

26:22.931 --> 26:25.323
Everybody needs
to wear one of these.

26:26.619 --> 26:28.756
Mother of mercy,
what happened to you?

26:28.791 --> 26:30.357
Listen to me.

26:30.392 --> 26:32.959
You are having a terrible
reaction to this medicine.

26:32.994 --> 26:36.267
I'm having a terrible reaction,
all right, to you guys, all of you.

26:36.302 --> 26:38.185
- Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Can this wait?

26:38.220 --> 26:40.786
Because I'm
about to tear this one.

26:43.802 --> 26:45.963
Look at me, Monk.

26:45.998 --> 26:47.966
Take off the glasses.

26:50.579 --> 26:52.308
Sharona's right.
You need help.

26:52.343 --> 26:54.958
Leland. Leland, I, I'm fine.

26:54.993 --> 26:57.232
I feel fine. Really.

26:57.267 --> 26:59.430
My mind is clear for
the first time in years.

26:59.465 --> 27:03.499
Like a curtain has been lifted, okay?

27:03.534 --> 27:05.932
Let, let's do some police work here.

27:05.967 --> 27:11.574
Is there a suspect
in the house? - Yeah.

27:12.897 --> 27:14.746
He's right over there.

27:14.781 --> 27:17.564
You thought I was good before,
wait till you see this.

27:17.599 --> 27:20.725
Hey, you might want to take
some notes or something.

27:22.003 --> 27:25.698
- Lester highsmith.
- That's me.

27:25.733 --> 27:28.953
Lester highsmith.
You've been a bad boy, Lester.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.842
Me and my posse would like
to have a little word with you.

27:31.877 --> 27:35.464
Lester highsmith, you were married to
Marlene highsmith. Is that correct?

27:35.499 --> 27:37.739
That's right. - We're sorry about
what happened.

27:37.774 --> 27:40.595
- Are you?
- How long have you worked here, Les?

27:40.630 --> 27:42.510
About a year and a half.
Is this guy with you?

27:42.545 --> 27:45.515
I could never work here.
I couldn't wear the uniform.

27:45.550 --> 27:49.137
- It's not my scene.
- I would never hire you.

27:49.172 --> 27:50.983
Were you here on Monday?

27:51.018 --> 27:55.557
- That depends. What time?
- Oh, say about 12:05 P. M.

27:55.592 --> 27:58.279
Just about the time
your ex was jumping off

27:58.280 --> 28:01.210
her own balcony wearing
nothing but a bathrobe.

28:01.245 --> 28:04.173
- You think I killed her?
- Oh, yeah.

28:04.208 --> 28:06.503
At 12:05, I was standing right here.

28:06.538 --> 28:09.920
That's true. We were with him.
I have his time card right here.

28:11.172 --> 28:14.450
- You left at 12:15.
- Yes, sir. I checked my voice mail.

28:14.485 --> 28:18.522
There was a message from Marlene.
She was depressed... again.

28:18.557 --> 28:21.503
She said she was really gonna do it this
time. - Why didn't you call the police?

28:21.538 --> 28:23.165
Well, she's been threatening
to jump for years.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.536
It's kind of her theme song.

28:24.571 --> 28:26.615
I drove over there
to calm her down.

28:26.650 --> 28:28.947
It was a couple of miles away, but I
couldn't get anywhere near the place.

28:28.982 --> 28:30.405
The whole place had roadblocks.

28:30.440 --> 28:32.240
A cop had been shot.

28:32.275 --> 28:33.889
That was me.

28:34.345 --> 28:36.383
Oh, that's tough. I know.

28:36.418 --> 28:38.482
I was shot a couple
of years ago on the job.

28:38.517 --> 28:40.811
They found a gun.
It was registered to your wife.

28:40.846 --> 28:44.247
- Can you explain that?
- I can't. Can you?

28:44.282 --> 28:45.929
Can you?

28:46.155 --> 28:47.844
I just said I can't.

28:48.860 --> 28:50.620
I didn't even know she had a gun.

28:50.655 --> 28:52.495
What kind of car do you drive?

28:52.530 --> 28:53.622
A corolla.

28:53.657 --> 28:55.796
- What color is it?
- Turquoise.

28:55.831 --> 28:58.421
- That's blue, isn't it?
- I guess it is.

28:58.456 --> 29:01.176
- Did you shoot my partner?
- What? No!

29:01.211 --> 29:03.675
Why would I shoot you, huh?

29:03.710 --> 29:05.764
I mean, do I even know you?
Have we even met?

29:05.799 --> 29:07.543
Give me one good reason
why I would hurt you,

29:07.578 --> 29:11.713
especially then, 10 minutes after my
ex-wife jumps off a balcony in her bathrobe?

29:11.748 --> 29:14.185
Whoa, whoa, time-out.
Time-out.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.975
How did you know she was in a bathrobe?
We never said anything about a bathrobe.

29:17.010 --> 29:18.660
Yes, you did.
Two minutes ago.

29:18.695 --> 29:20.496
All right. - Come on.

29:20.531 --> 29:22.183
Give me those,
give me those pills.

29:22.218 --> 29:26.240
No. No, Sharona, no.
The Monk needs the pills, okay?

29:26.275 --> 29:28.456
Give them to me. - No.
Just don't do this. - No.

29:28.491 --> 29:29.913
- Randy.
- Hey, Randy, give them to me.

29:29.948 --> 29:31.815
- No. Monk, no.
- Give them to me.

29:31.850 --> 29:33.377
All right, come on, give them to me!
I want them.

29:33.412 --> 29:34.909
Sharona, give them to me.

29:34.944 --> 29:36.681
- Just give them to me.
- Captain!

29:39.591 --> 29:41.516
I am so out of here.

29:42.376 --> 29:45.637
- Why'd you throw it to him?
- I thought he would catch it.

29:45.672 --> 29:47.219
Sorry.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.276
Will you give me
those pills? - No.

29:52.212 --> 29:54.211
Adrian, give me
the pills. - No.

29:54.732 --> 29:57.606
Hey, will you stop?
Give me those pills?

29:58.575 --> 30:00.606
- Adrian, you're sick.
- No.

30:00.641 --> 30:04.276
No, I'm well, and
you can't stand it, can you?

30:04.617 --> 30:07.842
I'm doing fine without you,
and it drives you crazy.

30:07.877 --> 30:10.372
- Come on.
- I'm happy, Sharona,

30:10.407 --> 30:13.698
for the first time in years,
and I love it.

30:13.733 --> 30:15.314
I love the Monk.

30:16.806 --> 30:18.728
Is that your car?

30:19.008 --> 30:20.879
Pretty righteous, huh?

30:23.720 --> 30:26.669
- You can't afford this!
- I couldn't afford not to buy it.

30:26.704 --> 30:28.391
You wouldn't understand.

30:29.486 --> 30:31.881
Will you please call Dr. Kroger?

30:31.916 --> 30:35.768
Will you please call Dr...
I thought you'd be happy for me.

30:35.803 --> 30:37.591
But you're just like the others.

30:37.626 --> 30:39.933
You're a big L-7.

30:41.528 --> 30:44.737
It's a square.
That's what you are.

30:46.114 --> 30:49.672
- Where are you going?
- New orleans. Mardi gras.

30:49.707 --> 30:51.532
Mardi gras's not for
another nine months!

30:51.567 --> 30:53.490
Hey, you know what they say.

30:53.525 --> 30:55.709
wherever the monk is,

30:55.744 --> 30:57.753
it's mardi gras.

31:06.811 --> 31:09.610
Oh, you're going down!
Hold on, hold on,

31:09.645 --> 31:11.584
I got you!

31:11.619 --> 31:13.317
I got you!

31:13.352 --> 31:15.233
What are you doing?

31:15.268 --> 31:16.738
Having fun.

31:16.773 --> 31:18.614
Horsing around in the pool.

31:20.574 --> 31:21.739
Could you please stop that, sir?

31:21.774 --> 31:26.329
Hey, hey, I'm heading down to
New orleans for mardi gras. Ever been?

31:26.364 --> 31:27.378
I went last year.

31:27.413 --> 31:29.615
That is so tight.
But dig it.

31:29.650 --> 31:32.155
The Monk on Bourbon street.

31:32.190 --> 31:35.216
That should be pretty wild,
am I right?

31:35.251 --> 31:37.844
Seriously, seriously,
cut it out.

31:37.879 --> 31:40.051
Hey, you guys wanna come?

31:40.086 --> 31:42.143
I got a car. - I can't.
My old man would kill me.

31:42.178 --> 31:44.085
Your old man's bringing me down.

31:44.120 --> 31:46.200
That whole generation...

31:46.235 --> 31:48.813
Man, they just don't get it.

31:48.848 --> 31:50.937
He's younger than you.

31:50.972 --> 31:52.857
Word.

31:53.511 --> 31:55.608
So what do you guys
want to play now?

31:57.677 --> 32:00.066
You ever play a game
called Marco polo?

32:01.696 --> 32:03.534
Marco!

32:06.458 --> 32:08.493
Marco!

32:11.291 --> 32:13.291
Marco!

32:16.282 --> 32:17.995
Marco!

32:19.783 --> 32:22.248
Wait, I'm not sure I get...

32:37.970 --> 32:40.110
A citywide manhunt continues
today for the gunman

32:40.145 --> 32:44.939
who shot and wounded deputy chief of
detectives, Leland stottlemeyer on Monday.

32:44.974 --> 32:47.203
Stottlemeyer, who's still
recovering from his wounds,

32:47.238 --> 32:49.897
spoke to reporters today
outside of police headquarters.

32:49.932 --> 32:53.067
We're asking anyone with any information
to please come forward

32:53.102 --> 32:55.111
if they've seen anything unusual.

32:55.146 --> 32:59.202
We believe that there's somebody
out there, um, shooting at cops.

33:55.842 --> 33:57.183
- Miss Fleming?
- Yes.

33:57.218 --> 33:58.767
He's here.

34:07.855 --> 34:09.420
Is it you?

34:09.891 --> 34:11.433
I think so.

34:18.818 --> 34:20.953
What happened to the Monk?

34:20.987 --> 34:24.248
- Trudy didn't like him.
- Neither did I.

34:24.284 --> 34:26.679
I wanted to strangle him, but...

34:26.715 --> 34:29.414
that would've meant
hurting you. - Yeah...

34:30.587 --> 34:35.344
I don't remember. Did I, did I
say anything stupid? - No.

34:36.068 --> 34:38.107
I mean, no more than usual.

34:38.754 --> 34:41.094
So, tell me, why did you
want me to meet you here?

34:41.130 --> 34:44.437
Well, there's something
wrong with this room.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.350
It's been bothering me.

34:48.270 --> 34:50.911
Do you have a copy
of the suicide note?

34:53.810 --> 34:55.431
"The pain is too much.

34:55.928 --> 34:58.070
I'm so sorry."

34:58.105 --> 35:03.659
"The pain is too much.
I'm so sorry."

35:08.304 --> 35:13.294
"The pain is too much.
I'm so sorry."

35:26.631 --> 35:28.752
- Sharona.
- What?

35:28.787 --> 35:30.985
- Where's the pen?
- What pen?

35:31.020 --> 35:33.660
This note was written
with a red pen.

35:34.563 --> 35:37.977
I don't see a red pen
in here, do you? - No.

35:41.348 --> 35:44.199
I mean, the letter was
written over here, but...

35:44.835 --> 35:47.137
No red pen.

35:47.172 --> 35:49.419
But no red pen.

35:49.454 --> 35:53.083
And there wasn't one on the
body when she jumped.

35:59.394 --> 36:01.553
Somebody else wrote that note.

36:27.663 --> 36:29.243
Get a wipe ready?

36:34.043 --> 36:37.379
- What is it?
- It's the first suicide note.

36:37.414 --> 36:39.127
The real one.

36:39.162 --> 36:42.928
Two years ago in Cincinnati,

36:42.963 --> 36:45.592
I helped my husband

36:45.627 --> 36:50.531
stage... an armored car robbery.

36:53.766 --> 36:55.684
Oh, my god.

36:56.353 --> 36:59.581
Here.
Officer! Officer!

36:59.616 --> 37:01.085
Listen, I want you
to call the captain,

37:01.120 --> 37:03.152
tell him that there's
an armed robbery in progress

37:03.187 --> 37:05.666
at the mountain view industrial park,
do you understand?

37:05.701 --> 37:07.729
Come on, it's 2 miles away.
Let's go.

37:07.764 --> 37:09.342
Let's go.

37:16.748 --> 37:18.895
Yeah, we're on our way now!
We'll meet you right there.

37:18.930 --> 37:20.800
He wants to know if it's
the old you or the new you.

37:20.835 --> 37:23.919
- Blinker, blinker, blinker, blinker!
- You hear that?

37:23.954 --> 37:25.841
He says welcome back.
Fill him in!

37:25.876 --> 37:27.749
Captain, yes, it was Lester highsmith.

37:27.784 --> 37:29.672
He's definitely the guy.
Dog, dog!

37:29.707 --> 37:33.319
Yeah, right. We found his ex-wife's
suicide note. The real one!

37:33.354 --> 37:35.005
That's what this whole
thing has been about...

37:35.040 --> 37:38.736
Trolley, trolley, trolley!
Aah! Look out!

37:39.321 --> 37:41.723
Lester and Marlene were, aah!

37:41.758 --> 37:43.818
Lester and Marlene pulled
an armored car job two years ago.

37:43.853 --> 37:45.362
Right, and they were
planning another one.

37:45.397 --> 37:46.777
But Marlene was racked by guilt.

37:46.812 --> 37:47.907
She couldn't go through it again.

37:47.942 --> 37:49.878
She spilled her guts out
in that suicide note.

37:49.913 --> 37:53.495
You missed it!
What are you..

37:53.530 --> 37:54.666
Whoa.

37:54.701 --> 37:57.054
Listen to this.
Two years ago, in Cincinnati,

37:57.089 --> 37:59.056
I helped my husband stage
an armored car robbery.

37:59.091 --> 38:02.338
We killed the driver.
And now he wants us to do it again...

38:02.373 --> 38:04.583
Friday, 10:00 A. M.,
at the mountain view industrial park.

38:04.618 --> 38:05.983
I'd rather die.
May god forgive me.

38:06.018 --> 38:08.802
Before Marlene killed herself, she
called Lester and left him a message.

38:08.837 --> 38:11.392
She must've mentioned the note
she had just written.

38:11.427 --> 38:14.104
Lester knew that note could
send him to death row,

38:14.139 --> 38:16.698
so he had to recover it
before we found it.

38:16.733 --> 38:18.284
Listen to this.
That was a red light.

38:18.319 --> 38:20.147
He got to her building,
but he was too late.

38:20.182 --> 38:23.080
Some cops had already shown up.
He couldn't go inside.

38:23.115 --> 38:25.743
He had to stop them
from finding that note.

38:25.778 --> 38:27.950
He needed a diversion...

38:27.985 --> 38:32.315
something serious enough to draw
the cops away from her building.

38:32.350 --> 38:33.667
- But what?
- Shooting me.

38:33.702 --> 38:34.950
Exactly!

38:34.985 --> 38:37.601
He drove a few blocks
and shot the first cop he saw.

38:37.636 --> 38:39.643
He knew every officer
in the city would respond,

38:39.678 --> 38:42.537
including the two cops that
were outside Marlene's building,

38:42.572 --> 38:45.956
which meant he had plenty of
time to go back to her place,

38:45.991 --> 38:50.402
destroy the real suicide note,
and replace it with one of his own.

38:50.437 --> 38:53.665
- A stop sign is not a suggestion!
- Yes, it is!

39:05.144 --> 39:07.233
Sorry, Kelly.
Nothing personal.

39:12.029 --> 39:13.456
Lester! Drop the gun!

39:13.491 --> 39:15.902
Just drop it!
Drop it.

39:17.411 --> 39:19.329
You.

39:21.618 --> 39:23.489
Is that a water pistol?

39:24.088 --> 39:26.106
No.

39:27.558 --> 39:31.020
Maybe.
It's hot water.

39:31.055 --> 39:34.560
It's scalding.
Scalding hot water. Just drop it.

39:36.947 --> 39:38.745
Highsmith, drop it!
Drop the gun!

39:38.780 --> 39:40.985
Get down! Get down!
Show me your hands!

39:41.020 --> 39:44.369
Show me your hands!
Down, down!

39:44.404 --> 39:45.907
Down on your knees!

39:54.443 --> 39:57.033
Hey, Lester, you remember
my partner, don't you?

39:57.068 --> 39:59.878
You put a bullet
in his shoulder.

40:00.296 --> 40:04.849
You got anything
to say to him? Yeah.

40:06.182 --> 40:07.639
It's all right, Randy.

40:07.674 --> 40:10.644
He's got at least 50 years
to think of something.

40:11.421 --> 40:13.596
Good job, son.

40:13.631 --> 40:15.384
Get this piece of
crap out of here.

40:20.212 --> 40:23.314
Do you think Dr. Kroger would
want me to throw these away?

40:25.583 --> 40:27.969
I think everybody wants you
to throw them away.

40:28.706 --> 40:32.875
You understand that if, if I toss these
out, you'll never see the Monk again.

40:40.756 --> 40:43.167
- I missed you.
- I missed me, too.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.955
I love you.
