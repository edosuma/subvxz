01:04.635 --> 01:06.275
"It wasn't difficult to gain entry

01:06.370 --> 01:08.136
into one of these private institutions.

01:08.338 --> 01:11.006
I merely listed a series
of symptoms of alcohol abuse

01:11.074 --> 01:12.975
I had read in a medical manual.

01:13.076 --> 01:14.909
Upon hearing I could afford my stay,

01:15.078 --> 01:17.346
the hospital was more
than willing to admit me.

01:17.513 --> 01:19.714
Once inside, I felt like
Lewis Carroll's Alice

01:19.849 --> 01:21.616
on the other side of the looking glass.

01:21.885 --> 01:25.087
What was done to the patients one
could hardly define as treatment."

01:25.255 --> 01:27.689
Do you think this could be
Cromartie where Thackery is?

01:27.824 --> 01:29.757
- Well, there are...
- Listen to this.

01:30.026 --> 01:33.627
"The doctors would routinely do what
was known in the halls as quieting,

01:33.762 --> 01:36.998
drugging the patients
into a lethargic stupor."

01:37.099 --> 01:39.733
The reporter, did he take the drugs?

01:39.734 --> 01:41.869
I don't know.

01:42.037 --> 01:43.971
The article was actually
written by a woman.

01:44.006 --> 01:45.806
Genevieve Everidge.

01:47.109 --> 01:48.442
Look.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.219
Are we going to let them back?

02:00.254 --> 02:03.056
Well...

02:03.090 --> 02:05.325
it may not be up to us.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.061
Report from Cromartie
is that you walked away.

02:08.295 --> 02:11.864
No, no, no, it turned out to
be a dangerously run facility.

02:12.033 --> 02:16.168
I managed to escape
thanks to Dr. Gallinger.

02:16.269 --> 02:18.804
And your time with him has cured you?

02:18.905 --> 02:21.908
I'm here because I'm well again.

02:22.042 --> 02:25.210
I haven't taken any cocaine for some time

02:25.379 --> 02:28.480
and the heroin drug
that they treated me with

02:28.582 --> 02:31.150
is completely gone from my system.

02:50.069 --> 02:51.770
He's back.

02:51.771 --> 02:54.172
What? Where?

02:54.273 --> 02:56.474
I need to be busy again, to work,

02:56.609 --> 02:59.343
and I am confident in my ability to do so.

02:59.412 --> 03:01.580
Well, I for one am not.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.549
Nor am I. You'll have to be monitored.

03:04.584 --> 03:06.051
Monitored? How?

03:06.252 --> 03:09.187
You'll need approval for
any degenerate medications

03:09.288 --> 03:10.755
you take out of the dispensary.

03:10.923 --> 03:14.425
And we'll assign someone
to look at your skin

03:14.627 --> 03:17.996
to be sure there are no signs
of injection of any kind.

03:18.097 --> 03:19.863
Oh, good. For a moment there,

03:19.999 --> 03:21.799
I thought it would be
something humiliating.

03:21.967 --> 03:24.402
You started this by
humiliating this hospital.

03:24.536 --> 03:27.472
And yourself. So let's call it insurance.

03:27.506 --> 03:29.474
And it's not negotiable.

03:29.541 --> 03:31.509
And this is after everything?

03:31.510 --> 03:33.511
Damn it, Thack.

03:33.645 --> 03:37.215
That debt was paid long
ago and you know it.

03:37.283 --> 03:40.084
This is your catastrophe.

03:40.152 --> 03:42.886
Dr. Thackery,

03:43.055 --> 03:46.290
we are doing this because
we want you to succeed.

03:46.525 --> 03:49.760
We're all better off when you
have a scalpel in your hand.

03:49.861 --> 03:52.663
I don't plan on doing much surgery.

03:52.731 --> 03:55.566
Oh, for God's sakes.

03:55.700 --> 03:58.302
What do you plan on doing with your time?

03:58.503 --> 04:01.471
I want to do some research
into what causes addiction.

04:03.474 --> 04:07.344
What we're banking on is
your reputation as a surgeon.

04:07.545 --> 04:11.848
Your towering stature can
help us finance the new Knick.

04:11.916 --> 04:14.884
The donors want to see you

04:15.019 --> 04:17.320
performing magic in the surgical theater,

04:17.422 --> 04:20.023
not you hunched over some microscope.

04:20.158 --> 04:22.058
That's a waste of your time at that.

04:22.193 --> 04:24.761
I don't see how excessive use of narcotics

04:24.862 --> 04:26.996
is worthy of scientific study.

04:27.098 --> 04:28.498
Because it needs to be cured

04:28.499 --> 04:31.067
and it should be treated
like any other disease.

04:31.102 --> 04:32.869
Addiction a disease?

04:33.004 --> 04:35.172
I've never heard of anything so absurd.

04:35.340 --> 04:38.574
Addiction is a failure
of personal morality.

04:38.676 --> 04:40.376
I'd like to test that theory.

04:40.578 --> 04:43.412
I'd happily inject you with
cocaine and heroin for a week

04:43.581 --> 04:46.615
and see if your morals and
character is still intact.

04:46.851 --> 04:49.318
I think everyone here would
agree that's an insane suggestion.

04:49.419 --> 04:51.287
- Indeed.
- I'd like to see it.

04:51.555 --> 04:54.090
- Henry.
- Call it a disease if you wish,

04:54.257 --> 04:56.993
but it's still the disease
of indigents and lowlifes,

04:57.094 --> 04:59.128
present company excluded, Doctor.

04:59.262 --> 05:02.665
It bedevils the rich and the poor alike.

05:02.867 --> 05:05.768
I've certainly seen my
fair share of soused heirs

05:05.803 --> 05:07.937
and addicted heiresses.

05:08.071 --> 05:09.551
Cromartie was full of them.

05:09.607 --> 05:13.275
If I can find a cure,
then the new Knickerbocker

05:13.477 --> 05:15.811
will become the leading
hospital in treating the epidemic

05:15.979 --> 05:18.980
and we can charge handsomely
for that treatment.

05:20.483 --> 05:24.652
If we did decide to go with your plan,

05:24.754 --> 05:27.255
how would you go about finding

05:27.289 --> 05:29.624
this addiction cure?

05:32.128 --> 05:33.862
I have no idea.

05:39.769 --> 05:41.937
I'm terribly sorry, okay?
We're gonna make this up to you.

05:41.938 --> 05:44.706
We're gonna get you all fixed
up, okay? I'm terribly sorry.

05:44.974 --> 05:47.809
We're supposed to bring people to
the hospital, not send them there.

05:47.810 --> 05:49.977
Jesus Christ.

05:52.148 --> 05:54.449
Tom.

05:54.450 --> 05:56.784
Tom!

05:56.818 --> 05:58.853
We got a problem.

05:59.088 --> 06:01.208
This thing came off and
knocked some lady in the head.

06:01.357 --> 06:03.190
Knocked her out cold. Her
husband's real pissed off.

06:03.292 --> 06:04.532
I don't give a fuck about them.

06:04.660 --> 06:06.794
Get it fixed before
this guy meets his maker.

06:06.995 --> 06:09.529
I guess old Cleary hasn't
read the legend of John Henry.

06:09.531 --> 06:11.331
Fuck off, Pete.

06:15.937 --> 06:18.739
- That the stabbing from up on 23rd Street?
- Fuck off, Pete!

06:18.940 --> 06:21.541
We'll have this fixed in
a jiff and be on our way.

06:23.945 --> 06:25.746
Which way does it go?

06:25.813 --> 06:27.480
Are you fucking serious?

06:27.514 --> 06:29.047
I've never done it before.

06:29.216 --> 06:31.817
- Take him.
- All right, let's load her up.

06:31.952 --> 06:34.253
Sure thing, gentlemen. Thanks, Cleary.

08:02.207 --> 08:04.141
I was so worried about you.

08:06.077 --> 08:08.912
I've been sick about it.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.681
Praying every night.

08:13.818 --> 08:15.051
And then you went missing

08:15.153 --> 08:17.588
and I thought I'd never see you again.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.257
I needed to get better.

08:23.395 --> 08:25.228
Are you?

08:25.230 --> 08:27.030
I am.

08:33.236 --> 08:35.104
What's wrong?

08:36.740 --> 08:38.674
John.

08:42.446 --> 08:44.480
I love you.

08:48.752 --> 08:50.486
And you love me.

08:53.691 --> 08:55.357
I know you do.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.560
You said it to me.

08:58.762 --> 09:02.998
I said and did a great many
things that I shouldn't have.

09:05.135 --> 09:06.735
Lucy...

09:08.839 --> 09:11.073
we can't be together.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.920
Don't say that.

09:26.956 --> 09:29.057
You love me.

09:30.627 --> 09:32.327
We just need time together.

09:32.462 --> 09:35.129
Look. Listen, listen. Listen.

09:35.197 --> 09:37.699
You are young and beautiful

09:37.833 --> 09:39.668
and there is so much possibility in you.

09:41.337 --> 09:43.237
Look, if we end things now,

09:43.339 --> 09:45.073
few people will be any the wiser

09:45.141 --> 09:47.776
and you can start anew.

09:47.843 --> 09:51.079
I don't want to start anew.

09:53.148 --> 09:56.350
- I want to continue on.
- No, look.

09:56.518 --> 09:59.019
- It's the only way this can be.
- No! No!

09:59.020 --> 10:00.821
Lucy.

10:00.822 --> 10:04.492
No. No.

10:04.526 --> 10:06.460
I think you should go.

10:10.332 --> 10:13.166
I can't.

10:16.204 --> 10:19.072
I was sent here by Mr. Barrow...

10:21.042 --> 10:23.644
to check you for needle marks.

10:24.879 --> 10:26.947
To map them.

10:30.685 --> 10:33.653
He thought a colleague would
be too humiliating, so...

10:36.457 --> 10:38.825
'Cause I know all your hiding places.

10:56.110 --> 10:57.810
Thank you, James.

10:59.647 --> 11:02.314
Ahoy, Neely Doll!

11:06.920 --> 11:09.321
Dad told me you bought one of those things.

11:09.323 --> 11:11.357
It's miraculous.

11:11.459 --> 11:13.026
Oh, careful you don't get electrocuted.

11:13.227 --> 11:15.078
It's how they're gonna run
the subways when they're built.

11:15.079 --> 11:16.262
- Really?
- Mmm.

11:16.397 --> 11:17.430
I wish I had known you were coming.

11:17.431 --> 11:18.598
I'd have given you a ride.

11:18.733 --> 11:20.799
I didn't know myself until this morning.

11:20.901 --> 11:22.834
My in-laws sat me down last night

11:23.136 --> 11:27.440
and told me I must decide how to keep
the Showalter name in the society pages.

11:27.607 --> 11:30.142
Eunice wanted me to join
her art patrons' group

11:30.277 --> 11:32.178
or do something with the new libraries.

11:32.179 --> 11:33.912
Sounds dreadful.

11:34.081 --> 11:35.948
- You want me to talk to Phillip?
- No.

11:36.016 --> 11:37.583
I owe it to him to do my best.

11:37.751 --> 11:40.318
He was so sad about leaving San Francisco.

11:40.486 --> 11:43.121
Besides, I've decided
I'm going to help organize

11:43.256 --> 11:44.816
the fundraising ball for the new Knick.

11:44.957 --> 11:47.024
So at least I'll be back
at my old stomping grounds.

11:51.764 --> 11:53.698
Why are these charts different?

11:54.967 --> 11:57.068
It's a new system.

11:57.103 --> 11:58.936
It's confusing.

11:59.038 --> 12:01.573
It's easier to read for most people.

12:01.774 --> 12:04.609
Even an orderly can be aware
of a patient's condition.

12:04.777 --> 12:07.177
I agree with Gallinger.
What is that, Latin?

12:10.783 --> 12:13.651
Mr. Watt here suffered
from a severe ear infection.

12:14.853 --> 12:16.286
The buildup of fluid

12:16.388 --> 12:18.455
eventually caused his eardrum to burst.

12:18.657 --> 12:21.325
In order to restore his
hearing and relieve his pain,

12:21.493 --> 12:24.261
he's been scheduled for
a tympanoplasty tomorrow.

12:24.396 --> 12:27.164
Well, you're familiar with the procedure.

12:27.165 --> 12:29.032
You perform it.

12:29.033 --> 12:31.167
Actually...

12:32.837 --> 12:35.071
I think Dr. Gallinger
would be a better choice.

12:37.308 --> 12:39.676
It's time I begin relinquishing patients.

12:39.877 --> 12:42.197
Dr. Gallinger's been out of
the operating room for a while.

12:42.212 --> 12:44.732
This would be a good procedure
on which to resharpen his skills.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.550
Very well.

12:47.652 --> 12:49.285
Gallinger, he's your patient.

12:49.420 --> 12:52.756
I assure you, my skills haven't dulled,

12:52.757 --> 12:54.858
but I'll take him.

12:54.892 --> 12:58.294
You all right, Edwards?

12:58.362 --> 13:01.197
Just surprised to see you back.

13:01.231 --> 13:03.033
I wasn't expecting it.

13:03.067 --> 13:05.135
I'm sure you weren't.

13:05.336 --> 13:08.337
Well, now that I'm back,
let's put things right again.

13:08.505 --> 13:11.073
You can start by rewriting
all of these charts

13:11.075 --> 13:12.608
the correct way.

13:12.909 --> 13:16.045
The orderlies don't need to be
aware of the patient's condition,

13:16.046 --> 13:17.580
but I do.

13:20.917 --> 13:23.686
It's had a few mechanical
difficulties, I'll admit,

13:23.887 --> 13:26.047
but we're talking about a
very sophisticated invention.

13:26.290 --> 13:29.325
Yes, if it was any more sophisticated,
it would never have run at all.

13:29.426 --> 13:31.160
I paid you for a working ambulance

13:31.295 --> 13:32.928
and now we're back to
using the damn horses.

13:32.929 --> 13:34.497
It's temporary.

13:34.598 --> 13:36.030
She's with a mechanic right now.

13:36.199 --> 13:37.799
I'm going down this
afternoon to collect her.

13:37.933 --> 13:39.867
She'll be right as rain
and better than new.

13:40.103 --> 13:43.605
Fine, but any more problems and
I will terminate this arrangement.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.740
Now, on the subject of our arrangement.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.176
I know it's a few more
weeks until the next payment,

13:48.444 --> 13:50.912
but I was hoping you'd be white
enough to advance me the money today.

13:50.980 --> 13:52.614
Pay the mechanic's bill and all.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.683
- No.
- Oh, for fuck's sake, Barrow.

13:54.884 --> 13:57.151
The sooner I get my money,
you sooner you get your cake.

13:57.153 --> 13:59.287
I will happily wait.

14:08.964 --> 14:11.132
Oh, dear God.

14:18.974 --> 14:21.308
Ahem.

14:21.309 --> 14:23.310
Nurse Elkins.

14:23.345 --> 14:25.379
I need your assistance.

14:27.149 --> 14:28.649
What with?

14:28.850 --> 14:33.420
Something that further relies
on your talent for discretion

14:33.522 --> 14:36.056
and your stomach for the less savory.

14:47.701 --> 14:50.603
Ahem.

14:50.637 --> 14:53.005
Hello, everyone.

14:53.006 --> 14:54.907
Ahem.

14:57.478 --> 14:59.412
Hello, my dear.

14:59.513 --> 15:02.515
You're looking very beautiful.

15:04.318 --> 15:06.352
What's he doing here?

15:06.353 --> 15:08.354
You know him?

15:10.023 --> 15:13.025
Of course. Through your...

15:13.127 --> 15:15.795
association with Dr. Thackery.

15:15.963 --> 15:20.300
But we have our own relationship, don't we?

15:20.468 --> 15:23.502
Uh, Nurse Elkins, we are starting

15:23.703 --> 15:27.172
a new philanthropic endeavor
here at the hospital.

15:27.407 --> 15:31.610
These unfortunate women are in
need of regular medical attention.

15:31.711 --> 15:34.879
And as a service to the community,

15:34.981 --> 15:37.115
we are going to provide it to them.

15:37.350 --> 15:40.118
I take it we won't be
registering any of these patients.

15:40.353 --> 15:42.788
As I said, your talent for
discretion will come in handy.

15:42.922 --> 15:45.691
Now, should anything
need further examination,

15:45.825 --> 15:47.959
it should be brought to my attention

15:48.094 --> 15:52.531
and I will somehow find
a doctor to take over.

15:52.599 --> 15:55.467
Right down this hall. Thank you.

15:55.701 --> 15:58.169
Ah, there you are, Herman. They
said you'd come down this way.

15:58.271 --> 16:00.104
- Oh, my.
- Dr. Mays.

16:00.206 --> 16:03.007
I was just explaining a new...

16:03.042 --> 16:05.877
a new philanthropic...

16:07.446 --> 16:08.980
they're pathetic creatures.

16:09.081 --> 16:11.015
And you're helping these poor girls?

16:11.017 --> 16:12.583
We are.

16:12.618 --> 16:16.254
Terribly sad situation.

16:16.421 --> 16:19.390
But Nurse Elkins has
everything under control.

16:19.458 --> 16:20.859
Perhaps I could lend a hand.

16:21.060 --> 16:23.862
I cared for a great number
of women in my practice.

16:23.963 --> 16:25.363
Of course, none as lovely as these.

16:25.397 --> 16:28.099
We're really just organizing it now.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.168
Uh, who's first?

16:30.202 --> 16:32.070
How about you?

16:32.138 --> 16:33.771
Forgive me, my hands are cold,

16:33.873 --> 16:36.841
but my heart is yours, hmm?

16:36.908 --> 16:38.475
Hop up on the table, dear.

16:41.079 --> 16:42.880
I think we have everything under control.

16:42.947 --> 16:46.116
And they need their privacy.

16:46.117 --> 16:48.018
Don't we all.

16:56.327 --> 16:58.195
What are those?

16:58.262 --> 16:59.763
So she can put her legs up.

16:59.964 --> 17:03.166
Oh, ridiculous. She can just
rest them over my shoulders.

17:03.267 --> 17:05.300
I'll get some swabs for you.

17:05.335 --> 17:06.568
That's not necessary.

17:06.670 --> 17:08.271
Then how will you culture them?

17:08.338 --> 17:09.939
A good nose and a pair of eyes

17:10.107 --> 17:12.088
are all a doctor needs to
know what he's dealing with.

17:12.089 --> 17:16.012
Now, let's get that coat off, shall we?

17:21.284 --> 17:22.952
So what do we do now?

17:26.190 --> 17:28.671
You can't believe he's competent
after everything you've heard.

17:29.927 --> 17:31.627
How could he be?

17:34.497 --> 17:36.565
He'll just tear down
anything you've built here.

17:36.666 --> 17:39.468
The madness, the inefficiency,

17:39.636 --> 17:42.471
his circus tent, it will
all come roaring back.

17:42.505 --> 17:44.172
And Gallinger with it.

17:46.109 --> 17:48.811
I'm so glad that you've decided to join us.

17:48.945 --> 17:51.513
Having a Showalter among us will do wonders

17:51.615 --> 17:53.181
for bringing the other ladies along.

17:53.350 --> 17:55.617
Most of them haven't had
the benefit of being raised

17:55.785 --> 17:57.952
in an atmosphere of
refinement like you and I.

17:58.153 --> 18:01.722
Well, everyone seems to be
very enthusiastic, Mrs. Barrow.

18:01.890 --> 18:04.024
Well, they understand
how important our work is.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.561
Vitally. Bertie. Excuse me.

18:06.629 --> 18:08.228
It's good to see you.

18:08.330 --> 18:09.810
I had heard you returned to New York.

18:09.898 --> 18:11.699
My ears were ringing. Who told you?

18:11.700 --> 18:13.601
Dr. Edwards.

18:13.702 --> 18:15.269
I've missed this place terribly.

18:15.404 --> 18:17.104
Well, then you're back
in an employment capacity?

18:17.172 --> 18:19.239
No, only to plan a party,

18:19.374 --> 18:22.409
but at least it keeps me
close to the excitement.

18:22.577 --> 18:26.447
Oh, I assumed you were back
because of Inspector Speight.

18:26.681 --> 18:29.349
I recall you and he were
close when you worked together.

18:29.416 --> 18:30.916
What are you talking about?

18:33.420 --> 18:36.622
He was found washed up dead
on the banks of the East River.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.325
My God. When?

18:39.359 --> 18:40.960
Just a few days ago.

19:08.754 --> 19:11.356
Bertie the Wise.

19:11.424 --> 19:13.691
It's good to see you again.

19:13.793 --> 19:16.928
I'm just trying to set things up.

19:17.063 --> 19:19.197
You've been briefed on
my new line of research?

19:19.299 --> 19:21.166
I hope you're up for another long...

19:21.267 --> 19:23.468
I've come to tender my resignation.

19:27.106 --> 19:30.008
Look, I know you and I had
a rough go at the end there,

19:30.210 --> 19:32.744
but there's no need to
make an abrupt decision now.

19:35.215 --> 19:38.083
This is actually the least
abrupt way I can do this.

19:39.819 --> 19:42.854
Look, I was impaired.

19:43.122 --> 19:47.124
You know, the drugs made me do things
I would never have done otherwise.

19:47.292 --> 19:50.728
And I believe they made
you more your true self.

19:50.830 --> 19:53.164
You sound like your father talking.

19:55.133 --> 19:57.735
I'm not sure if you're aware,

19:57.803 --> 20:00.605
but I actually loved her.

20:00.639 --> 20:02.540
And she's free of me.

20:02.808 --> 20:05.488
You know, the circle of people who
know about our past is miniscule.

20:05.678 --> 20:07.979
- If you can see beyond it...
- You are no more sane than before.

20:08.180 --> 20:12.283
Don't get confused by some
puritanical notion of womanhood.

20:12.485 --> 20:15.820
You know, virginity is a
man's idea meant to shame.

20:17.590 --> 20:19.423
Regardless of what she's done with me,

20:19.625 --> 20:22.460
she's no less pure than she
was the day she got here.

20:24.530 --> 20:27.832
She's now less pure than
when I walked into this room.

20:31.035 --> 20:32.836
You didn't know?

20:35.673 --> 20:38.909
I suppose the circle was even
more miniscule than you realized.

20:44.148 --> 20:47.684
This wood here very, very strong.

20:47.719 --> 20:49.486
But is it the best?

20:49.654 --> 20:52.856
The best? There's better,
but very expensive.

20:52.957 --> 20:55.325
The hospital wants only the best.

20:55.560 --> 20:59.229
Wood that is as strong as the
steel we'll use for the structure.

20:59.330 --> 21:01.164
It's farther away from Catskills.

21:01.299 --> 21:03.032
Have to have more men, more horse.

21:03.200 --> 21:07.137
This wood almost good.
Many, many buildings use.

21:07.305 --> 21:11.207
I am not interested in
a bargain, Mr. Karwoski.

21:12.977 --> 21:15.578
How do I make this plain enough for you?

21:17.415 --> 21:20.617
You bring us the most expensive wood,

21:20.717 --> 21:23.418
and then you get to bill us for more.

21:23.420 --> 21:25.487
- Ah.
- Yes.

21:25.656 --> 21:28.090
Because this hospital
will be here long time.

21:28.091 --> 21:30.192
Ah, no.

21:30.427 --> 21:34.764
Because I only get the one chance
to skim off the building of it.

21:34.865 --> 21:38.233
So I am still giving you back 20%?

21:38.368 --> 21:41.637
Yes, yes, but you profit more in the end.

21:41.672 --> 21:44.339
And so do I. You see?

21:44.441 --> 21:47.075
- I think so. Yes.
- Good. Good.

21:47.276 --> 21:50.078
I throw in nails for free
because you are premium customer.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.914
No.

21:53.015 --> 21:55.550
You charge us for those, too.

21:55.618 --> 21:57.952
You charge us for everything.

21:59.288 --> 22:00.722
All right?

22:00.756 --> 22:02.590
- Yes.
- Good.

22:02.592 --> 22:05.560
Good.

22:05.561 --> 22:08.163
Oh, Polacks.

22:08.364 --> 22:10.026
Your prayers have been answered, Harry.

22:10.027 --> 22:13.167
Mr. Whitting is the finest
lawyer in the whole city.

22:13.235 --> 22:15.369
Maybe even the whole country.

22:15.570 --> 22:18.372
He's got one of them grand
offices down on Broad Street.

22:18.474 --> 22:20.741
- Went to Harvard.
- Hello, Sister.

22:20.775 --> 22:22.376
I'm a sister no more.

22:22.544 --> 22:25.213
You will be in court. I'll make sure of it.

22:25.280 --> 22:28.048
What'd I tell you?

22:28.150 --> 22:30.551
So I'll get 15 years instead of 20.

22:30.652 --> 22:32.953
What are you being so negative for?

22:33.055 --> 22:34.888
Tell him what he don't know.

22:35.124 --> 22:38.659
The law states that any person who
willfully produces a miscarriage

22:38.827 --> 22:41.128
shall be punished by
imprisonment in a state prison

22:41.330 --> 22:44.232
for a term not less than four
years or more than 20 years.

22:44.433 --> 22:46.553
But what kind of bastard
judge would do that to a nun?

22:46.668 --> 22:48.636
They'd do it to a nun
that done what I'd done.

22:48.770 --> 22:50.738
And with all the hoopla
this case will bring,

22:50.906 --> 22:52.381
there's going to be
pressure to make it hurt.

22:52.382 --> 22:53.916
Why you bringing her down?

22:54.016 --> 22:55.312
I thought you said she had a chance.

22:55.313 --> 22:56.809
The fuck did I bring you
all the way out here for?

22:56.814 --> 22:59.215
- Cleary, let the man speak.
- She does have a chance.

22:59.383 --> 23:01.918
Your work with the orphanage
and the poor will help.

23:02.119 --> 23:04.239
Although any mention of your
involvement with children

23:04.321 --> 23:06.589
will remind people of the ones you aborted.

23:06.691 --> 23:08.124
Tell her about them loopholes.

23:08.292 --> 23:10.052
'Cause you didn't even
do the fix on the girl

23:10.127 --> 23:11.561
since she was a fake
for the coppers, right?

23:11.562 --> 23:12.996
Not even pregnant. Tell her.

23:13.163 --> 23:15.131
I'm also looking into
any possible loopholes

23:15.199 --> 23:17.633
in the way the laws are written.

23:17.735 --> 23:19.635
'Cause I asked how can you be arrested

23:19.904 --> 23:22.672
for doing an abortion you didn't
do on a girl who wasn't with child.

23:22.807 --> 23:25.208
Got him thinking about them loopholes.

23:25.409 --> 23:27.649
Well, it's not unusual for
cops working with Mr. Comstock

23:27.678 --> 23:29.312
to set traps such as
the one that snared you.

23:29.413 --> 23:31.580
Mr. Comstock's a pain in my arse.

23:31.816 --> 23:34.951
His Society for the Suppression
of Vice does keep me in business,

23:35.086 --> 23:37.453
but those arrests rarely
end in a conviction.

23:37.688 --> 23:40.222
So I've asked the judge to
schedule an immediate hearing

23:40.491 --> 23:43.693
to decide if the case should be
dismissed before ever going to trial.

23:43.927 --> 23:47.797
See? Me and him, we're gonna
have you out of here in no time.

23:47.931 --> 23:50.733
Now I just need to get some information.

23:51.001 --> 23:55.204
The charges against you were
filed under the name Rose Dolan.

23:55.372 --> 23:58.474
- Is that your full name?
- Rose Agnes Dolan, yes.

23:58.575 --> 24:00.976
Rose? Where'd that come from?

24:01.011 --> 24:03.045
It's my birth name.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.314
Harriet was what I took after my vows.

24:06.783 --> 24:09.418
Harriet's better. You're no Rose.

24:12.189 --> 24:14.156
Thanks for the compliment.

24:17.794 --> 24:19.629
So you think you'll have everything
ready by the first hearing, then?

24:19.630 --> 24:21.463
I believe so.

24:21.698 --> 24:24.199
But there's still the matter
of my fees and expenses.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.301
My office has yet to
receive any money from you.

24:26.435 --> 24:29.938
I've had a slight delay in getting them,

24:30.073 --> 24:33.008
but I'll have them by the end of the week.

24:33.109 --> 24:35.510
- Don't you worry.
- All right.

24:36.813 --> 24:39.446
Full steam ahead.

24:44.419 --> 24:47.654
Cold must have killed the battery.

24:49.992 --> 24:51.525
Not to worry.

24:51.593 --> 24:53.161
I'll hail you a carriage.

25:04.072 --> 25:05.471
I'm Detective Satterlee.

25:05.639 --> 25:07.307
You the lady asking about
the health inspector?

25:07.441 --> 25:10.010
Speight, yes. I'm Cornelia Showalter.

25:10.244 --> 25:13.246
I worked with him at the Knick
chasing a typhoid epidemic.

25:13.347 --> 25:15.548
- Why don't we sit down?
- Thank you.

25:18.019 --> 25:20.253
What do you want to know?

25:20.354 --> 25:23.023
Just what you found out so far.

25:23.091 --> 25:26.159
Well, not much to tell.

25:28.662 --> 25:31.863
He was seen leaving a
saloon on Water Street.

25:31.998 --> 25:34.300
He got on a late ferry home to Brooklyn.

25:34.467 --> 25:36.368
Looks like he must have
fell off and drowned.

25:37.838 --> 25:39.405
Surprised he washed up.

25:39.539 --> 25:40.840
Usually the current takes them out to sea

25:40.841 --> 25:42.641
and we never find them.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.910
Did anyone see him fall in?

25:46.346 --> 25:49.448
No one sounded for overboard.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.450
But drunks slip in quieter than you think.

25:51.618 --> 25:53.986
Can't even hear the splash
over the steam engine.

25:54.121 --> 25:55.921
We get one like this every week or two.

25:56.189 --> 25:59.391
What was it you wanted to talk
to me about, Mrs. Showalter?

25:59.392 --> 26:02.126
Stop that.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.928
Cornelia.

26:06.531 --> 26:08.866
I... I had a medical question.

26:10.535 --> 26:13.404
Is it possible to detect alcohol

26:13.572 --> 26:17.041
in the body of a person,
specifically a dead one?

26:18.543 --> 26:20.211
Why do you ask?

26:20.379 --> 26:23.147
I'm sure you've heard
about Inspector Speight.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.749
Yes. Tragic.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.686
And also a bit mysterious.

26:28.888 --> 26:31.522
I just spoke to the detective
in charge of the case.

26:31.723 --> 26:35.158
- Cornelia.
- And he told me Speight was terribly drunk

26:35.260 --> 26:37.194
when he fell off the ferry and died.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.729
Is this really your business?

26:38.764 --> 26:40.965
But Speight didn't drink.

26:41.032 --> 26:43.467
Never has. Not a drop.

26:45.370 --> 26:48.138
You're certain about this?

26:48.239 --> 26:50.474
Dealing with drunks in flophouses

26:50.609 --> 26:52.743
made him a strong believer in temperance.

26:52.744 --> 26:53.978
Zealous, really.

26:54.179 --> 26:57.180
A lot of men have been
known to lose their resolve

26:57.248 --> 26:58.782
and bend an elbow at a bar.

27:00.919 --> 27:03.220
It would certainly explain his
inability to hold his liquor.

27:03.221 --> 27:04.855
Not Speight.

27:04.889 --> 27:07.357
It's very strange

27:07.458 --> 27:10.593
and no one's giving it a second look.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.430
I'm guessing you haven't
spoken to Phillip about this.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.401
No.

27:17.535 --> 27:20.570
I know I shouldn't get involved.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.674
I could probably devise a test.

27:24.909 --> 27:27.377
But you would have to get to
his body before it decomposes,

27:27.478 --> 27:29.279
which will happen much faster than usual

27:29.380 --> 27:30.813
since it was found in water.

27:30.915 --> 27:34.051
Also, he's already been buried.

27:35.619 --> 27:37.820
Well, getting his body out of the ground,

27:37.922 --> 27:40.223
I'm afraid, is beyond my skills.

27:51.669 --> 27:54.170
What the hell are you
doing out there, Otto?

27:54.438 --> 27:57.406
You're moving around like you're
trying not to let a shit pop out.

27:57.441 --> 27:58.942
Sorry, Mr. Cleary.

27:59.076 --> 28:01.844
I saw you beat this slug three weeks ago.

28:01.945 --> 28:04.047
Pinned him faster than he did you.

28:04.081 --> 28:06.649
That match was fixed.

28:09.953 --> 28:11.554
What was that, fella?

28:11.622 --> 28:13.856
It was fixed. I went limp.

28:14.091 --> 28:16.993
That's a load of shite. He
pinned you like an old biddy.

28:17.027 --> 28:19.361
Only because I let him.

28:19.462 --> 28:21.197
I didn't know nothing about it.

28:21.265 --> 28:23.665
All right, who fixed it?

28:23.666 --> 28:26.435
His old manager.

28:26.603 --> 28:29.138
Wanted to unload this
chump on some dumb sap.

28:29.172 --> 28:31.372
I guess that was you.

28:37.013 --> 28:40.048
You can have the dollar I made tonight.

28:40.149 --> 28:42.150
What's that supposed to buy me?

29:23.059 --> 29:24.825
Another.

30:15.210 --> 30:17.344
Do you like this song?

30:17.412 --> 30:19.313
I can't say I know it.

30:19.547 --> 30:22.349
It's called "When We Were
Married." Pretty, isn't it?

30:22.450 --> 30:24.150
You want to get married already?

30:24.152 --> 30:26.052
We only just met.

30:26.154 --> 30:28.488
Well, a girl can pretend, can't she?

30:28.589 --> 30:31.291
Ooh, I'll gladly take pretend tonight.

30:31.292 --> 30:32.892
Mmm.

30:32.960 --> 30:35.495
- What's your name?
- Cate.

30:35.497 --> 30:37.297
Hello, Cate.

30:37.298 --> 30:39.333
I'm John.

30:39.467 --> 30:41.602
John, would you like to dance with me?

30:41.736 --> 30:45.572
No, I would not like to dance with you.

31:01.455 --> 31:04.657
Don't miss a button. Wouldn't
want the wife to get wise.

31:04.692 --> 31:06.860
I don't have a wife.

31:06.861 --> 31:08.628
Oh.

31:08.796 --> 31:10.797
Maybe I can come see you
at your place next time.

31:10.831 --> 31:12.799
A little cleaner.

31:12.867 --> 31:15.001
I don't want it cleaner.

31:15.202 --> 31:17.603
People in California are
Americans just like us,

31:17.705 --> 31:19.939
but may as well be on the moon

31:20.140 --> 31:22.008
for all they care about
what's going on in New York.

31:22.009 --> 31:25.111
It's true. No one there has
even heard of the Schermerhorns

31:25.212 --> 31:27.413
or the Robertsons or the Showalters.

31:27.548 --> 31:29.715
Then how does anyone know who's important?

31:29.850 --> 31:31.851
It's usually the man with the biggest gun.

31:33.220 --> 31:34.888
Sounds awful.

31:35.056 --> 31:37.856
No way to know if someone's
a person of quality.

31:37.991 --> 31:40.158
Who'd want to live in a place like that?

31:40.159 --> 31:43.395
I agree.

31:43.496 --> 31:47.232
You must have noblemen and women

31:47.333 --> 31:48.867
to show the people how to be.

31:48.969 --> 31:51.837
To give them someone to admire.

31:52.005 --> 31:54.606
That's why Hungary leads
the world in so many ways.

31:54.708 --> 31:57.976
Oh, yes, we all want to be Hungarian.

31:58.144 --> 32:00.913
Tibor and Gwynnie will be
gone for several months.

32:01.081 --> 32:04.215
Cornelia, you and Phillip
will have a lot more room

32:04.250 --> 32:06.418
in our house to move around.

32:06.586 --> 32:08.820
I assumed our apartment
would be finished by then

32:08.921 --> 32:10.154
and we'd have already moved out.

32:10.189 --> 32:11.690
Of course it will.

32:11.824 --> 32:14.192
I meant in the off chance it wasn't.

32:14.327 --> 32:16.194
With all the construction in New York,

32:16.329 --> 32:18.330
I barely know when the men will show up

32:18.498 --> 32:21.065
and half the time the workers muck it up.

32:21.167 --> 32:24.202
Seems your father's kidnapped

32:24.337 --> 32:27.004
all the best labor for the new hospital.

32:27.072 --> 32:30.575
Well, building the new Knick,

32:30.676 --> 32:32.510
it's going to take some doing.

32:32.678 --> 32:36.147
I mean, competition for
competent crews is fierce.

32:36.248 --> 32:39.317
We'll just have to dig deeper.

32:39.351 --> 32:40.351
I'd rather you didn't.

32:40.385 --> 32:41.953
I'm not concerned.

32:41.954 --> 32:43.620
You should be.

32:47.392 --> 32:49.327
Charity is all well and good,

32:49.461 --> 32:51.229
and you know I believe
in it as much as you,

32:51.429 --> 32:54.531
but we need to find other
donors to lessen our share.

32:54.533 --> 32:56.067
I gave.

32:56.135 --> 32:58.002
And I told you you didn't need to.

32:58.103 --> 32:59.623
I'm more than happy to cover the cost.

32:59.705 --> 33:03.074
I'm just doing what those
Californians are doing...

33:03.075 --> 33:04.641
looking ahead.

33:04.777 --> 33:08.045
We could use that money to diversify.

33:08.213 --> 33:10.780
H.H. Prettyman is bidding
to build the new subway

33:10.915 --> 33:12.382
and there's still a position available

33:12.383 --> 33:13.917
for another partner in the venture.

33:14.118 --> 33:17.220
Burrowing your way through
dirt and rock like a gopher

33:17.454 --> 33:20.423
to build a train no one in
their right mind would dare ride?

33:20.591 --> 33:23.093
- It's dangerous business.
- It's the future.

33:23.227 --> 33:24.995
It's a disaster in the making.

33:25.163 --> 33:28.365
Now, you heard Hobart. Half
those crews are a menace.

33:28.465 --> 33:30.633
Now you want them blasting their way

33:30.735 --> 33:32.903
beneath this city with dynamite?

33:33.071 --> 33:35.271
25 years ago you would have jumped at this.

33:35.272 --> 33:38.241
And 25 years ago

33:38.275 --> 33:40.710
you were in diapers.

33:40.845 --> 33:44.514
So I'll thank you to know your place, son.

33:46.817 --> 33:49.318
I wish I had your troubles.

33:51.254 --> 33:54.156
The city makes us take in
every Negro psychopathic patient

33:54.290 --> 33:56.825
and then gives us nothing in return.

33:57.094 --> 33:59.574
We're lucky we have enough
medicine to get us through the week.

33:59.629 --> 34:02.965
Anesthesia, that's a luxury.

34:03.133 --> 34:07.303
Well, we may have more
resources at the Knick,

34:07.370 --> 34:09.670
but they don't make it easy.

34:11.274 --> 34:14.909
They expect me to thank
them on a daily basis

34:15.112 --> 34:17.346
for the gifts that they
believe they've given me.

34:20.050 --> 34:21.683
Did you read the article
in the paper last week

34:21.684 --> 34:23.985
about the cyclist, Major Taylor?

34:24.018 --> 34:26.020
No, get to the point.

34:26.021 --> 34:28.188
Do you remember?

34:28.224 --> 34:29.858
The man goes over to Europe

34:29.992 --> 34:33.061
and is treated like the King of England.

34:33.129 --> 34:34.696
Stays in the best hotels.

34:34.797 --> 34:37.431
Breaks every possible record.

34:37.533 --> 34:40.702
He returns home, makes no difference.

34:42.672 --> 34:45.039
He's just a nigger on a bike.

34:54.083 --> 34:56.952
There's some people I'd
like for you to meet.

35:26.281 --> 35:27.747
Daddy.

35:27.748 --> 35:29.582
Hello, Cricket.

35:35.356 --> 35:36.990
You stopped writing.

35:37.091 --> 35:39.159
Your mama and me was worried about you.

35:39.194 --> 35:40.927
I'm fine, Daddy.

35:41.095 --> 35:42.935
Didn't have to leave
everyone back home for me.

35:42.964 --> 35:44.531
I may not have wanted you up here,

35:44.732 --> 35:47.400
but if you are, I'm gonna
make sure you're right.

35:47.534 --> 35:50.136
Everybody's soul needs protecting.

35:50.304 --> 35:52.571
Besides, I'm sure I'll
find myself plenty of folks

35:52.739 --> 35:55.307
in need of the Lord's good
word in a place like this.

35:55.408 --> 35:58.544
Probably just in this building alone.

35:58.611 --> 36:00.279
Let me show you around.

36:00.280 --> 36:02.281
Come on.

36:15.127 --> 36:17.462
This is where we perform
all of our surgeries.

36:19.833 --> 36:22.968
I think it's a special place.

36:23.102 --> 36:25.837
You wouldn't believe what happens here.

36:25.972 --> 36:28.139
Don't you let yourself get too impressed

36:28.241 --> 36:30.075
by anything a man can do.

36:30.276 --> 36:35.580
Or build like that Grand
Central Depot I came into.

36:35.781 --> 36:39.050
I'm only interested in the
miracles God can create.

36:41.253 --> 36:43.821
The things we can do,

36:43.955 --> 36:46.123
I think they might impress even you.

37:18.155 --> 37:20.090
The citrate of caffeine is for?

37:20.190 --> 37:21.825
Mitigation of symptoms.

37:21.893 --> 37:24.694
- Ox gall?
- Indigestion.

37:24.829 --> 37:27.196
What the hell is this Dr. Mays doing here?

37:27.364 --> 37:30.433
- Get rid of him.
- No, you barely know the man.

37:30.568 --> 37:32.535
I know enough to know
that I'd rather have you

37:32.637 --> 37:35.105
operating on me with a spoon.

37:35.306 --> 37:38.507
Everyone deserves a
chance to prove themselves.

37:38.508 --> 37:40.109
Don't you agree?

37:46.149 --> 37:47.750
Nurse Elkins.

37:47.818 --> 37:50.719
Good morning, Doctor.

37:50.854 --> 37:53.689
Daddy, this is the chief of surgery,

37:53.723 --> 37:55.457
Dr. John Thackery.

37:55.559 --> 37:57.793
- A.D. Elkins.
- Honor to meet you.

37:57.928 --> 37:59.962
You're a preacher, correct?
Should I call you...

38:00.063 --> 38:01.764
Oh, I don't go in for any of that.

38:01.865 --> 38:03.632
I'm here to serve Him, not myself.

38:03.866 --> 38:07.369
Well, it seems you've passed
that along to your daughter.

38:07.536 --> 38:10.938
No one gives as much to
the patients as she does.

38:12.275 --> 38:16.044
She's seen a lot since she started here.

38:16.212 --> 38:20.348
And she's proven herself
the best of all of us.

38:20.549 --> 38:23.117
Raise them up right and
they'll always find their way.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.254
Amen.

38:40.102 --> 38:41.502
What is this?

38:41.536 --> 38:44.771
A fever cabinet.

38:44.806 --> 38:46.073
Where did it come from?

38:46.208 --> 38:48.676
Dr. Edwards had it installed last month.

39:07.261 --> 39:10.896
Edwards, can I get an
explanation on this fever cabinet?

39:10.964 --> 39:12.298
Something wrong with your eye?

39:12.400 --> 39:14.834
It's just a scratched cornea.

39:14.968 --> 39:16.902
Is that why you passed on that surgery?

39:16.937 --> 39:18.904
No, it's nothing.

39:18.972 --> 39:20.640
What did you want to know?

39:20.641 --> 39:23.276
Fever cabinet.

39:23.477 --> 39:26.445
Yes, the patient is suffering
from Bright's disease.

39:26.679 --> 39:29.881
By inducing fever, I've seen a
decrease of albumin levels in his urine.

39:30.016 --> 39:32.284
That's an expensive toy for one disease.

39:32.419 --> 39:34.353
Fever therapy has a number of uses.

39:34.454 --> 39:35.887
I thought it a worthy investment.

39:35.922 --> 39:38.257
I don't believe you.

39:38.324 --> 39:40.525
I can show you the papers.

39:40.527 --> 39:41.893
Can you read German?

39:41.928 --> 39:44.496
Not about the cabinet.

39:44.697 --> 39:47.198
You passed on that eardrum
repair and gave it to Gallinger.

39:47.300 --> 39:48.534
Because I wanted to give him...

39:48.535 --> 39:50.502
I know, help him resharpen his skills.

39:50.503 --> 39:52.371
What is it?

39:53.806 --> 39:56.040
What's going on?

40:11.557 --> 40:13.992
It's my eye.

40:14.293 --> 40:17.461
So the puzzle is figuring out how
to get the subretinal fluid to drain

40:17.730 --> 40:21.266
so that hopefully when the retina
comes in contact with the choroid,

40:21.400 --> 40:24.202
it will reattach and
resume normal function.

40:24.336 --> 40:26.404
Have you tried applying any medications

40:26.472 --> 40:27.772
that might absorb the fluid?

40:27.906 --> 40:30.073
Salicylate of sodium, mercurial inunctions,

40:30.175 --> 40:31.942
even laxatives... all useless.

40:32.144 --> 40:34.945
The one treatment that
seems to show some promise

40:35.013 --> 40:38.015
is coagulation by electrolysis.

40:38.150 --> 40:40.585
I've been experimenting on rabbits.

40:40.586 --> 40:43.120
And?

40:43.322 --> 40:45.923
Good enough that I'm
willing to try it on myself.

40:46.024 --> 40:48.759
Good enough? Is that the standard?

40:48.827 --> 40:51.094
- To be blind...
- Don't.

40:55.033 --> 40:57.401
You have anyone to perform it?

40:58.737 --> 41:01.070
I was hoping you might help me with that.

41:10.181 --> 41:11.815
You're the only one I can trust.

41:15.719 --> 41:18.287
Please, John.

41:21.792 --> 41:23.232
Well, then we have to do it at night

41:23.294 --> 41:25.528
when the hospital is empty.

41:25.596 --> 41:28.130
You don't need anyone to know.

41:28.366 --> 41:31.835
I got fairly good at secret
surgery down in the subbasement.

41:33.237 --> 41:34.937
I've had some recent experience

41:35.039 --> 41:38.107
in clandestine procedures myself.

41:48.786 --> 41:51.220
I asked the police about exhuming the body,

41:51.421 --> 41:53.655
but they said Inspector
Speight's case was closed

41:53.757 --> 41:55.124
and they could be of no help.

41:55.225 --> 41:56.825
That's because they're too busy

41:56.960 --> 41:59.561
harassing the good men here at Tammany.

41:59.663 --> 42:01.662
They're not interested in the law.

42:01.798 --> 42:05.166
Clever man, though,
Teddy, I'll give him that.

42:05.267 --> 42:07.969
He just dangles police commissioner

42:08.104 --> 42:11.006
in front of Devery and that jackass just...

42:11.007 --> 42:13.074
And we're corrupt.

42:13.142 --> 42:16.978
Well, it sounds difficult.

42:17.080 --> 42:19.680
Will you consider an exhumation?

42:20.983 --> 42:23.851
See that bulldog, Mrs. Showalter?

42:24.987 --> 42:27.922
A gift. $5,000.

42:27.989 --> 42:30.590
10 times a cop's annual salary.

42:30.692 --> 42:33.127
Now who would pay that for this?

42:33.128 --> 42:35.462
I'll tell you.

42:35.697 --> 42:39.633
The people who are making sure
Speight's body stays in the ground.

42:41.036 --> 42:43.237
Who would ask you to do that?

42:45.807 --> 42:48.309
Unless you can buy me a better dog,

42:48.443 --> 42:50.144
I'm afraid our business here is done.

42:57.719 --> 42:59.386
Excuse me, miss.

43:04.324 --> 43:06.844
I'm just saying they got reason
to keep you at the uptown Knick.

43:06.894 --> 43:08.794
This is your truck. What do I got?

43:08.963 --> 43:10.723
I ain't gonna be fancy
enough for that place.

43:10.798 --> 43:12.832
You want to secure your employment?

43:13.033 --> 43:15.234
Learn a thing or two about
fixing a fucking suspension.

43:15.335 --> 43:17.203
- That's what I'm doing.
- Mr. Cleary?

43:18.973 --> 43:20.440
Miss Robertson.

43:21.809 --> 43:24.210
It's Mrs. Showalter now.

43:24.211 --> 43:26.545
Ah, right.

43:28.081 --> 43:30.516
How's holy matrimony treating you?

43:30.517 --> 43:32.317
Fine.

43:32.519 --> 43:35.588
I was wondering if you
could help me with something.

43:41.895 --> 43:45.197
I never pictured you
for a repeating customer.

43:45.365 --> 43:47.065
But I'm out of that game
since Harry got nabbed.

43:47.167 --> 43:49.167
- That's not...
- I got the name

43:49.402 --> 43:51.836
of an old Bulgarian lady who
does them down Clinton Street.

43:52.037 --> 43:54.172
But from what I've heard, you'd
be safer falling off a horse.

43:54.173 --> 43:55.773
That's not why I'm here.

43:56.008 --> 43:59.210
Harry told me you used to
dig graves at potter's field.

44:00.546 --> 44:02.346
She talked to you about me?

44:02.348 --> 44:04.916
Mm-hmm.

44:05.117 --> 44:08.185
Yeah, I used to work the
shovel there a few years back.

44:08.253 --> 44:10.688
You still own that shovel?

44:19.231 --> 44:21.064
Are you sure the guard won't say anything?

44:21.199 --> 44:22.933
Those two bottles of whiskey I gave him

44:23.201 --> 44:25.801
are the only things he'll be
talking to for the next couple hours.

44:30.942 --> 44:32.843
What's so funny?

44:32.877 --> 44:35.345
Over the years

44:35.480 --> 44:38.214
I committed a petty crime here or there.

44:38.316 --> 44:40.417
It's how a man survives in the city.

44:40.585 --> 44:44.021
But the two who drag me
into serious malfeasance

44:44.121 --> 44:47.491
are a society lady and a fucking nun.

44:53.464 --> 44:55.698
How is Harry doing?

44:58.903 --> 45:00.803
You ever been inside of a jailhouse?

45:03.507 --> 45:06.543
Well, it ain't exactly the Waldorf.

45:06.610 --> 45:09.779
After a while, those walls,

45:09.847 --> 45:12.549
they start whispering at you,

45:12.683 --> 45:14.817
telling you you ain't never gonna get out.

45:16.854 --> 45:20.290
I've known a few tough lads

45:20.457 --> 45:23.059
turn to jelly after a
while in a place like that.

45:24.929 --> 45:28.197
Now, Harry, she's tougher than all of them.

45:28.265 --> 45:31.067
But not for much longer.

45:31.134 --> 45:33.069
She's starting to go.

45:33.136 --> 45:34.403
She's lucky to have you.

45:34.505 --> 45:37.473
She needs more than me, miss.

45:37.474 --> 45:39.541
What can I do?

45:39.710 --> 45:43.813
Well, I did get her one
of them good old lawyers.

45:43.847 --> 45:47.416
Upper-class like you.

45:47.518 --> 45:50.352
Problem is, can't afford him.

45:52.188 --> 45:54.056
But you can.

45:54.124 --> 45:56.158
I can't ask my family...

45:56.159 --> 45:58.661
You have a boat

45:58.796 --> 46:01.763
in every port from here to Persia.

46:01.864 --> 46:04.500
You must have something set aside.

46:04.634 --> 46:06.201
Especially after what she did for you.

46:06.236 --> 46:08.837
I'll do everything I can.

46:08.871 --> 46:11.206
All right.

46:11.207 --> 46:14.209
Oh! Oh!

46:16.679 --> 46:18.113
There's our man.

46:31.861 --> 46:34.262
Will you look at that.

46:34.396 --> 46:36.898
Your Mr. Speight went and fucked away off.

46:40.570 --> 46:43.071
New York.

46:43.105 --> 46:45.006
Sure is a busy place.

46:45.240 --> 46:48.643
Can't go a step without
winding up shoulder to shoulder

46:48.711 --> 46:51.046
with white folks, Negro,

46:51.180 --> 46:55.249
Christian, Hebrew, Italian, Greek,

46:55.417 --> 46:58.820
Siamese, Japanese, and
everything in between.

46:58.955 --> 47:02.090
All the corners of the
Earth thrown together

47:02.224 --> 47:06.027
with strange tongues from Babel.

47:06.061 --> 47:08.762
Strange clothes.

47:08.797 --> 47:10.297
Even stranger beliefs.

47:10.398 --> 47:14.768
Why, just today I met a man

47:14.803 --> 47:18.271
called himself a Sikh.

47:18.373 --> 47:21.274
Carried a sword on his hip

47:21.376 --> 47:23.777
longer than a cavalryman's.

47:23.979 --> 47:26.139
I don't know what he was
seeking, but when he finds it,

47:26.214 --> 47:28.214
he's gonna have a whopper
of a weapon to handle it.

47:31.219 --> 47:34.354
I never met

47:34.389 --> 47:36.489
no one like that.

47:38.759 --> 47:42.061
And maybe before he come here to New York,

47:42.130 --> 47:44.197
he never met no one like me.

47:46.834 --> 47:48.868
Or you.

47:51.406 --> 47:54.874
But you and I do share

47:54.975 --> 47:57.711
one thing with him and everyone,

47:57.845 --> 48:02.014
one language we all
understand and answer to.

48:02.115 --> 48:04.383
And that's the language of God.

48:04.451 --> 48:06.918
- Amen.
- Amen.

48:06.920 --> 48:08.987
God...

48:09.022 --> 48:10.989
and His infinite wisdom.

48:10.990 --> 48:13.925
Hallelujah.

48:13.927 --> 48:16.895
The same God

48:16.996 --> 48:20.566
that shines inside our bodies...

48:22.369 --> 48:26.305
shines in the darkest jungles of Africa.

48:27.774 --> 48:31.508
Praise the Lord. Shembolamanca.

48:31.610 --> 48:35.246
The same spirit that rose Jesus

48:35.280 --> 48:37.381
up from the grave

48:37.382 --> 48:39.683
is the same spirit

48:39.818 --> 48:43.254
that built the Himalayan mountains of Asia.

48:43.354 --> 48:47.057
Glory to God. Escomenalambaska.

48:47.158 --> 48:50.828
The same God that spoke to Moses...

48:52.197 --> 48:56.366
is the same God that speaks to us

48:56.501 --> 49:00.236
as He is speaking through me right now.

49:13.384 --> 49:17.688
Let us sing for all of those
who cannot sing the word of God.

49:17.822 --> 49:21.057
♪ Shall we gather at the river ♪

49:21.191 --> 49:25.294
♪ Where bright angels' feet have trod ♪

49:25.395 --> 49:28.897
♪ With its crystal tide forever ♪

49:29.099 --> 49:32.935
♪ Flowing by the throne of God... ♪

51:05.828 --> 51:07.962
- How does that feel?
- Fine.

51:08.030 --> 51:10.164
I need the local anesthetic.

51:10.165 --> 51:12.133
Nurse Pell.

51:12.267 --> 51:15.369
A hypodermic of 4% cocaine solution.

51:15.370 --> 51:17.138
Yes, Doctor.

51:30.886 --> 51:32.019
Look up.

51:49.470 --> 51:51.371
Is it numbing?

51:51.372 --> 51:53.773
It's begun to.

51:55.576 --> 51:58.178
You need to make a two to
three-millimeter incision

51:58.312 --> 52:00.380
on the upper portion of the sclera.

52:00.481 --> 52:02.048
Once you've made the incision,

52:02.250 --> 52:04.550
twist the blade, which will
release the subretinal fluid.

52:04.551 --> 52:06.419
Surgical knife.

52:28.909 --> 52:31.210
What was that?

52:34.281 --> 52:36.348
Something wrong?

52:36.382 --> 52:39.118
No. No, it's fine.

52:43.089 --> 52:44.823
Dr. Thackery, if you're
not feeling up to this...

52:44.891 --> 52:47.092
No, you need this done.

52:51.397 --> 52:54.599
Stop. Dr. Thackery.

52:54.634 --> 52:55.900
Stop, Dr. Thackery.

52:55.901 --> 52:58.136
God damn it.

53:17.656 --> 53:19.724
John.

53:19.725 --> 53:21.926
Cate.

53:22.061 --> 53:24.595
So are we not dancing again tonight?

53:29.735 --> 53:31.969
One for me?

53:33.605 --> 53:35.373
Dan.

53:42.814 --> 53:44.815
To your health.

53:47.819 --> 53:49.854
Heroin?

53:49.855 --> 53:51.989
In this arm.

53:52.023 --> 53:54.024
This one's for cocaine.

53:54.125 --> 53:57.260
You inject both at the same time?

53:57.429 --> 54:00.530
Mm-hmm. The cocaine takes
the bottom off the heroin

54:00.665 --> 54:03.667
and the heroin takes
the top off the cocaine.

54:03.802 --> 54:08.005
Now they dance beautifully together.

54:08.106 --> 54:10.607
Until the cocaine wears off.

54:10.808 --> 54:13.543
That's when you find out if
you got the amounts wrong.

54:13.644 --> 54:15.545
And if you do, it'll kill you.

54:15.546 --> 54:18.148
But get it right...
