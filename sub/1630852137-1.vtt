WEBVTT

00:27.360 --> 00:32.320
The most difficult thing is to turn
this group of 25 people into a team.

00:32.400 --> 00:36.000
You must teach
the new players the qualities

00:36.080 --> 00:39.960
that allowed Juventus
to become a winning team,

00:40.040 --> 00:42.880
hard work and being a family.

00:48.720 --> 00:52.240
I like having responsibilities,
I like being under pressure.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.400
After each game, there can be criticism.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.720
I went through that as a player,
I'll go through it as a coach.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.400
Now, that's a nice one.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.640
The word Juventus means victory.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.440
We play to win it all every year.

01:11.880 --> 01:15.280
To me, Turin is the city where...
where I became great.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.560
My family is here,

01:16.680 --> 01:19.680
and if my family is with me,
I can go to the Moon.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.360
And then Juventus
is above everything else.

01:25.480 --> 01:29.240
Everyone needs to be focused
and centered around a single goal,

01:29.840 --> 01:30.800
the final victory.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.760
The ambition is always the same,
to win and play well.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.000
Nothing else matters.

01:36.080 --> 01:39.800
If you do the things that are right,
you'll be better than the others.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.280
Even if I'm 43 years old
and I'm still here,

01:50.360 --> 01:51.960
I still feel like a player,

01:52.040 --> 01:56.880
because I want to get my hands dirty
and give my all to win.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.080
It's Ronaldo.
Ronaldo, Ronaldo, Ronaldo.

02:01.160 --> 02:04.640
Ronaldo with his left foot.
What a cross!

02:04.720 --> 02:06.640
Go, Fede! Go, Fede!

02:06.720 --> 02:09.440
-Strong, go, go, go! It's a red.
-No!

02:09.520 --> 02:11.520
Ramsey runs toward the goal.

02:11.600 --> 02:12.560
Shoot!

02:12.640 --> 02:15.120
McKennie. It's two for Juventus!

02:15.720 --> 02:17.720
-Go, go, go!
-It's a foul!

02:24.080 --> 02:26.000
We are not playing to win.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.680
It's the game of a lifetime,
can't win one challenge.

02:28.760 --> 02:32.320
We can't play like this
if we want to win the title.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.880
Like this, we won't win.

02:39.240 --> 02:44.080
It's a difficult year,
a year of big decisions, of brave choices.

02:44.160 --> 02:46.440
We built a new team.

02:46.600 --> 02:51.880
I mean, seasons are still important,
even when you're trying to grow.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.200
Chiesa, at the edge.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.040
Rabiot, Rabiot, he shoots!

03:04.120 --> 03:06.160
Dybala!

03:06.240 --> 03:08.520
Goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.160
Juventus has the advantage!

03:10.240 --> 03:13.520
Juve, Juve!

03:13.600 --> 03:16.640
Olé!

03:21.360 --> 03:24.240
TURIN
AUGUST 2020

03:26.400 --> 03:28.880
A new season
of football is about to begin,

03:28.960 --> 03:31.240
and Juventus is ready
to face radical changes

03:31.320 --> 03:34.480
to keep their place
among the best clubs in the world.

03:34.560 --> 03:39.160
The news of this Saturday
is the new beginning for Juventus.

03:39.240 --> 03:40.080
RADIO 24 - FROM "TUTTI CONVOCATI"
8TH AUGUST 2020

03:40.160 --> 03:41.560
Maurizio Sarri is out,

03:41.640 --> 03:43.880
dismissed after
the Champions League failure,

03:43.960 --> 03:45.160
Andrea Pirlo in.

03:45.320 --> 03:49.320
He is a first-timer
since he has never coached before.

03:51.960 --> 03:55.320
He can be an added value
and give Juventus a new start,

03:55.400 --> 03:59.200
and give back some of the juventinità
that the team had lost with Sarri.

03:59.960 --> 04:03.120
There is respect
for a football legend like...

04:03.200 --> 04:06.200
like him, absolutely.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.920
Andrea Pirlo is a football legend.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.680
As a player he won everything,

04:24.760 --> 04:28.160
dictating the refined style
that earned him the nickname "Maestro".

04:28.800 --> 04:33.360
But none of us, no one, has a clue.
No one can know how he will be.

04:33.440 --> 04:37.320
If he'll be like Guardiola
or just another average coach.

04:38.440 --> 04:41.520
After battling together
with Juventus and the national team,

04:41.600 --> 04:45.920
now Pirlo and Buffon are together again,
but in an unprecedented situation.

04:46.040 --> 04:50.440
Between me and Andrea
there is... brotherhood.

04:50.520 --> 04:55.880
His failure would be
also a personal failure for me.

04:56.720 --> 05:01.440
And our number one,
the champion, Gianluigi...

05:01.520 --> 05:04.120
Buffon!

05:04.200 --> 05:07.600
The Agnelli family,
owners of the club since 1923,

05:07.680 --> 05:11.360
led Juventus to unprecedented successes.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.920
The team dominated the last decade,
winning nine Serie A titles.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.480
An unparalleled record
in the history of European football.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.800
At the center of this incredible
series of victories,

05:21.920 --> 05:25.600
a group of old friends
now together perhaps for the last time.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.800
They'll lead the growth of the new players
in this year of changes.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.760
That season, the season
of the first title of this era...

05:33.840 --> 05:35.280
GIANLUIGI BUFFON
GOALKEEPER

05:35.360 --> 05:37.480
...we ended it with no defeats.

05:37.560 --> 05:41.320
I must say that I remember
that evening with great pleasure.

05:41.400 --> 05:45.480
Well, this is Quaglia, and then Leo,
Chiello and Andrea Pirlo.

05:45.560 --> 05:49.400
This is a sort of seven eleven, right?

05:50.400 --> 05:56.080
Yes, a group... of hotheads
that also have a great connection.

05:56.160 --> 06:02.120
This is an essential value
if you want to reach great goals.

06:04.840 --> 06:10.640
I didn't expect Andrea
to coach Juventus so soon.

06:10.720 --> 06:11.840
GIORGIO CHIELLINI
DEFENDER

06:11.920 --> 06:14.040
We are not talking
of a teammate that quit,

06:14.120 --> 06:16.280
ten years ago and who is much older.

06:16.360 --> 06:20.720
Andrea, in a way, started
this winning streak for... Juventus.

06:20.800 --> 06:26.120
When I heard that Pirlo would coach,
I was happy but also surprised.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.640
CRISTIANO RONALDO
FORWARD

06:27.720 --> 06:32.640
But I remember how it was
to play at Real Madrid with Zidane.

06:32.720 --> 06:37.680
He has been inside the dressing room
and knows how we think.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.040
You know...

06:39.120 --> 06:40.680
LEONARDO BONUCCI
DEFENDER

06:40.760 --> 06:45.120
...when you've lived for so long
with a great player

06:45.200 --> 06:48.200
like the coach was... over the years,

06:48.280 --> 06:53.000
it was exciting to see him
on the other side.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.080
The man who leads the vision of the club

06:55.160 --> 06:58.720
is the president,
executive chairman Andrea Agnelli

06:58.800 --> 07:02.560
who, despite winning
the title last year with another coach,

07:02.640 --> 07:05.040
has new ideas
and expectations for the team.

07:05.120 --> 07:09.040
I've been president
of Juventus for ten years.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.880
When I look at last year,
I... I tell you from the heart,

07:12.960 --> 07:17.280
despite the things we won, last year
was a shitty year, in my opinion.

07:18.280 --> 07:22.200
Someone, even here,
didn't give their best.

07:22.280 --> 07:25.760
If I think of all the effort
that the women and men at Juventus,

07:25.840 --> 07:27.600
and we're 800,

07:27.680 --> 07:32.040
we go on the pitch as 800,
we win as 800 and we lose as 800.

07:32.120 --> 07:34.720
We are a team, we must be united,

07:34.800 --> 07:37.840
we must all pull in the same direction,
no matter what.

07:37.920 --> 07:42.080
I made a choice for the new coach
that I strongly believe in.

07:42.760 --> 07:47.040
But now it's up to the extended team
to follow him no matter what, every day.

07:47.720 --> 07:51.400
It will be a difficult year,
I have the excitement I used to have.

07:51.480 --> 07:55.800
Anyone who dares touch any one of you
will have to face me first.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.080
The rest is up to you.

08:02.840 --> 08:05.360
DRESSING ROOM

08:06.000 --> 08:10.160
This could be the last season
for many of the older players.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.840
Their example will be crucial
for the new players.

08:12.920 --> 08:16.760
Professionalism, charisma,
will to always give the best.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.360
Great, Gigione!

08:22.440 --> 08:23.880
Come on, the head there.

08:23.960 --> 08:27.080
He really thinks
that the body is fundamental.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.440
And it's partially true.

08:29.520 --> 08:33.640
But in the end, it's just the head, guys.
The energy you have in here.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.520
-How is it?
-Well, the weight is good, I'd say. 94.5.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.160
Good... No, it's very good.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.400
-Bye, Cri.
-Bye.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.320
The urine has a nice color, right?

08:44.960 --> 08:49.240
I'm my own doctor, my own physician.
My own mental coach.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.520
My nutritionist, my physician.

08:52.520 --> 08:57.040
If you do the things that are right,
you'll be better than the others.

08:57.120 --> 09:02.760
For example, I'll sunbathe for 20 minutes,
and I know it will help me.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.760
The sun is good for your body.

09:04.880 --> 09:09.720
Obviously, if I'm here all day,
it'll be bad for me and I'll get lines.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.520
But 30 minutes make me feel well.

09:12.600 --> 09:16.280
-At 36 years old, I'm still here...
-You need to wear a shirt!

09:16.400 --> 09:17.360
No!

09:17.440 --> 09:18.400
The sponsor!

09:18.480 --> 09:21.040
The sponsor is gone.

09:29.720 --> 09:30.960
CARLO PINSOGLIO
GOALKEEPER

09:31.040 --> 09:33.120
You don't have much hair to cut.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.120
-This way we can hide...
-This.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.640
Baldness and white hair.

09:42.640 --> 09:46.880
This year, Juventus decided that
the policy was to lower the age...

09:46.960 --> 09:48.640
the age average to build a cycle,

09:48.760 --> 09:51.880
like when... when I arrived ten years ago.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.160
I've been lucky to get to Juventus

09:55.240 --> 09:59.440
and find Buffon, Del Piero,
Chiellini, Marchisio next to me,

09:59.520 --> 10:03.640
who taught me
what it meant to wear this jersey.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.480
You couldn't...

10:08.520 --> 10:10.760
You couldn't say,

10:10.840 --> 10:13.640
"Today, I don't feel like it,
I won't push much"...

10:13.760 --> 10:15.080
LEONARDO BONUCCI
DEFENSE

10:15.160 --> 10:19.600
...because, after training,
someone would come and pull your ears.

10:19.640 --> 10:22.360
This is what we,
now that we are the seniors,

10:22.440 --> 10:24.880
must teach the new arrivals.

10:26.080 --> 10:30.360
Thank you, Marco, Sam, everyone.
Good luck with your work and your cuts.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.640
Juventus must rebuild.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.520
There are four or five
main things to do...

10:40.600 --> 10:45.240
it cannot be a market of...
of pure preservation.

10:46.120 --> 10:49.360
There is no ideal solution,
it's not all smooth.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.200
And I'm also curious to see

10:51.280 --> 10:54.160
how Pirlo will set up the team tactically

10:54.240 --> 10:56.280
because we've never really seen him.

10:56.880 --> 10:59.640
But Juventus needs a striker,
a number nine.

10:59.720 --> 11:03.320
The man responsible
for the radical change of Pirlo's team

11:03.400 --> 11:06.640
is the managing director football area,
Fabio Paratici.

11:08.040 --> 11:10.760
It has been a difficult year,

11:10.880 --> 11:15.440
a year of big choices,
also of brave choices.

11:15.520 --> 11:18.280
Because you cannot win without building.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.520
That's what the president
instilled in all of us,

11:21.600 --> 11:24.880
we must change before changing.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.600
We have many goalkeepers.

11:31.160 --> 11:32.800
We'll keep an eye on defenders.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.200
De Ligt is not with us
until 15th of November.

11:35.280 --> 11:36.680
In three, four months.

11:37.480 --> 11:38.720
A striker...

11:39.720 --> 11:41.760
-since Higuaín is leaving.
-Yes.

11:42.360 --> 11:43.400
That's necessary.

11:45.680 --> 11:50.440
Over the years, Juventus signed
some of the best players in the world,

11:50.560 --> 11:55.840
such as Platini, Zidane,
Baggio, and Del Piero.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.600
In ten years working with the team,
Paratici kept up the tradition,

11:59.680 --> 12:01.680
and in 2018, surprised everyone

12:01.760 --> 12:05.080
by signing the most expensive player
in the history of football,

12:05.160 --> 12:06.400
Cristiano Ronaldo.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.800
How can I tell the president
about this idea?

12:08.880 --> 12:10.280
I made a preliminary remark.

12:10.360 --> 12:11.360
TURIN
2018

12:11.440 --> 12:12.800
I said, "One, don't laugh.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.960
Two, don't throw me out of the office.

12:15.080 --> 12:19.440
"Let me finish, I'll explain everything,
and we'll make our considerations.

12:19.560 --> 12:22.040
"We could get Cristiano."

12:22.640 --> 12:26.240
The president made half a smile,
but I continued saying,

12:26.320 --> 12:30.640
"If I stop, I'll never say it,"
so I continued.

12:30.720 --> 12:34.600
But with the finances
heavily hit by the COVID crisis,

12:34.680 --> 12:36.880
Paratici is moving cautiously,

12:36.960 --> 12:39.800
searching for new talent
but with an eye on the balance.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.120
And we need strikers.

12:42.200 --> 12:46.400
So you need to know that this is
the negotiation and this is the situation.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.040
Good, take a leap.

12:49.080 --> 12:52.000
While the club gets ready
for the renovation,

12:52.080 --> 12:54.720
Pirlo must give his mark to the team.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.880
Three weeks left before
the beginning of the Serie A season.

12:59.360 --> 13:02.720
As a new and inexperienced coach,

13:02.800 --> 13:08.200
it is very helpful to have players
you shared important seasons with,

13:08.280 --> 13:11.640
since they know who you are,

13:11.720 --> 13:16.680
what you want, and they can
transmit it to their teammates.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.200
Hey! Be ready!

13:22.360 --> 13:25.960
Pavel Nedved, former player
and now vice-chairman

13:26.040 --> 13:30.400
and Andrea Agnelli's right-hand man,
is supervising the team's development.

13:30.480 --> 13:35.800
We knew Andrea as a young man,
a player, a person.

13:36.880 --> 13:41.440
We know that he can handle pressure,

13:41.520 --> 13:44.920
and we chose him together
as our future coach.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.200
We think he'll reach some goals.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.320
It's a calculated risk

13:53.440 --> 13:57.200
because when someone
is managing Juventus

13:57.280 --> 14:01.760
or working within Juventus,
one must be always focused on tomorrow.

14:03.880 --> 14:04.840
Good, good.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.160
The press can't wait
to interview the new coach.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.360
It's important to be prepared.

14:12.440 --> 14:14.680
-Today, topic of the day.
-The first.

14:14.760 --> 14:18.760
We're playing Devil's advocates,
saying what could be the...

14:18.840 --> 14:21.560
also the negative comments
that don't require a reply.

14:21.640 --> 14:24.480
Someone like you
has credibility in the dressing room.

14:24.560 --> 14:27.920
In the sea of comments of uncertainty,
about the unknown,

14:28.000 --> 14:31.040
there are also those
who already has a positive...

14:31.520 --> 14:33.320
-...opinion. Yes.
-We're here too.

14:33.400 --> 14:38.840
Yes, the curiosity today is that
you're the youngest coach in Serie A.

14:38.960 --> 14:43.160
This is what they can say,
after all you're the absolute youngest.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.120
-Forty-one years... Never before--
-No.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.440
De Zerbi is my age.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.840
-Were you born the same year?
-Yes.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.600
-Month?
-You're unprepared.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.280
Not unprepared.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.280
Emanuele Gamba, Repubblica.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.440
I'd like to ask you, they hired you,

15:18.520 --> 15:21.280
whether in the meantime you had doubts.

15:21.360 --> 15:25.160
I'm convinced I am in the right place
at the right time,

15:25.240 --> 15:27.880
so I didn't have any other thought.

15:27.960 --> 15:33.200
Well, what do you bring
that is important to Juventus now?

15:33.280 --> 15:37.760
I like a football of rotations,
with players that move,

15:38.360 --> 15:41.520
players who want to attack.

15:41.600 --> 15:45.280
The players we have
have the characteristics to do it,

15:45.880 --> 15:49.160
so the game plan
could change game in and game out.

16:00.000 --> 16:00.880
How did it go?

16:00.960 --> 16:01.920
-Well.
-Well.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.320
I didn't even pick my nose once.

16:05.680 --> 16:06.520
Well, at least...

16:07.320 --> 16:10.760
At the JTC Continassa,
the training center of the first team,

16:10.840 --> 16:14.680
they're all at work under the watchful eye
of Pirlo and the staff.

16:14.760 --> 16:17.760
This is the famous N, a straight line,

16:17.840 --> 16:20.240
three diagonals,
and you exit on the other side.

16:20.320 --> 16:23.840
Ready? Number two, two of one. Go.

16:24.880 --> 16:29.360
The 36 year-old Giorgio Chiellini needs
to get back in shape after an injury.

16:29.480 --> 16:32.240
His leadership
in the dressing room is uncontested,

16:32.320 --> 16:35.960
and also this season his calm strength
will be of vital importance.

16:36.040 --> 16:41.040
As you get older,
you must work more than the rest.

16:41.120 --> 16:45.840
And the only recipe
that I know is this one and...

16:45.920 --> 16:47.280
GIORGIO CHIELLINI
DEFENDER

16:47.360 --> 16:51.840
if I managed to play,
between 30 and 35 years old,

16:51.920 --> 16:54.680
some of the best seasons of my career

16:54.760 --> 16:57.520
and maintain such a high level,

16:57.600 --> 17:01.440
it is because now I fight,

17:01.520 --> 17:04.440
certainly, I try to do all I can

17:04.520 --> 17:09.080
to try to stay healthy and help the team

17:09.160 --> 17:12.080
and get the last few
satisfactions of my career.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.040
Good, well done all of you. Water.

17:14.080 --> 17:16.720
Anyway, players are always complaining.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.760
Sure. I don't give a crap
that they complain.

17:20.320 --> 17:23.320
If they saw what we did with Conte,
they'd kill themselves.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.760
-Exactly.
-People on the ground.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.200
They're a bit...

17:29.560 --> 17:33.040
-Are they tired?
-I can't look at them. I can't look see?

17:33.800 --> 17:35.480
They can't move.

17:35.560 --> 17:37.240
They can't move.

17:37.320 --> 17:41.040
-It's because they're working.
-Yes, that's why. They're heavy.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.520
Pirlo needs a striker, but first

17:44.560 --> 17:47.960
he needs to reduce the roster.

17:48.560 --> 17:52.200
They must free space for...
They're trying to get Chiesa.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.080
And we need to free some space.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.760
The coach must face his first challenge,

17:58.800 --> 18:03.720
to communicate to some of the players that
there's no space for them in the roster.

18:04.800 --> 18:08.240
I told you that if you must go play,
do you feel well now?

18:08.320 --> 18:09.880
-I'm good.
-You need to play,

18:09.960 --> 18:11.320
to score, and have fun also...

18:11.440 --> 18:12.280
MARKO PJACA
STRIKER

18:12.320 --> 18:15.240
...and come back next year
and play for Juventus.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.800
Prove that you can play.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.920
You've been idle a while,
last year you played six games.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.160
If you have the right mindset,
you'll do well for sure.

18:23.240 --> 18:26.680
Don't be scared of getting hurt,
only think about playing.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.760
Okay. All right.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.800
Our slots are sort of filled,

18:33.920 --> 18:37.440
you know, like the Champions list,
so to avoid leaving you out...

18:37.520 --> 18:40.800
And then there's the European.
You'll be on the National Team...

18:40.880 --> 18:41.720
LUCA PELLEGRINI
DEFENDER

18:41.800 --> 18:44.080
...where you play a game
every once in a while.

18:44.160 --> 18:47.560
Two options I was considering,
Mino knows everything anyway.

18:47.680 --> 18:48.560
So... Is that okay?

18:48.640 --> 18:50.640
Okay, I'll talk to him then.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.000
-It's okay.
-Yes.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.560
Having been a player myself,

18:57.640 --> 19:01.960
I could understand
the frame of mind of these guys.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.160
So, for me...

19:04.240 --> 19:05.560
ANDREA PIRLO
COACH - 1ST TEAM HEAD COACH

19:05.680 --> 19:10.440
...it wasn't easy to get there
and decide face to face with them,

19:10.560 --> 19:16.520
but it's better to talk about it vis-à-vis
than having the club telling them.

19:17.520 --> 19:23.080
-He can play on the National Team...
-Now he can go play...

19:23.160 --> 19:25.720
-Yes, did you tell him?
-Yes, I've just told him.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.200
I told him and to Marco,
that they should go.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.320
Yes, I told him now.

19:38.320 --> 19:42.560
When we come to Andrea's,
we often eat here to talk more...

19:43.640 --> 19:45.080
privately.

19:45.720 --> 19:46.960
Where are those two?

19:47.040 --> 19:49.080
VALENTINA BALDINI
ANDREA PIRLO'S PARTNER

19:49.160 --> 19:52.960
But... but... did you say hi?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.920
They are at the American School
at kindergarten.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.200
He told me,
"Dad, we're going in the bedroom,

19:58.280 --> 20:00.520
we'll do a pajama party together."

20:04.240 --> 20:08.800
The help of his friends is fundamental
for Pirlo in his new challenge.

20:08.920 --> 20:12.200
He has been friends with Roberto Baronio,
a technical staff,

20:12.280 --> 20:16.520
since they were at the Brescia youth team.

20:16.560 --> 20:19.960
No, then I remember you said,
"Now I start, I'll get the license,

20:20.040 --> 20:21.440
"I need to get a license,

20:21.520 --> 20:24.320
"so we can work together
and you'll be my second."

20:25.480 --> 20:28.800
And I said, "Yes, I see,
but I've been coaching for eight years,

20:28.880 --> 20:32.000
"maybe we can start that you...".

20:32.080 --> 20:33.800
He said,
"No, I'll find a team right away...".

20:33.960 --> 20:36.040
Let's say that he kept his word.

20:36.080 --> 20:39.520
When I called you this summer,
you were about to faint.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.760
I was about to faint, yes.

20:41.800 --> 20:46.720
I can say that, the only one
without stress, at that moment, was him.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.920
-Me in the field, no.
-I'm happy for him,

20:49.000 --> 20:50.560
but this is at 360 degrees,

20:50.640 --> 20:53.560
-it's not just football.
-But it's something incredible.

20:53.680 --> 20:56.680
-But he needs to be special.
-It's not like that for all.

20:56.760 --> 20:59.080
-When you're on a plane...
-I'm scared there.

20:59.160 --> 21:00.040
Exactly.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.480
-That's it.
-Because that is not my field.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.080
Sky reports this news,

21:15.200 --> 21:17.880
Weston McKennie from Shalke 04
is headed to Juventus.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.520
Twenty-two years old, American,

21:19.560 --> 21:22.480
on loan with a buying option,
he's an inside-forward.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.160
-How are you?
-I'm fine, and you?

21:24.240 --> 21:25.240
Good, good.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.520
-Wow.
-Hey.

21:36.560 --> 21:37.440
Team captain.

21:37.520 --> 21:38.880
-Giorgio.
-Nice to meet you.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.960
-Welcome in Turin.
-Thank you. Appreciate it.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.560
-How are you?
-Good, good.

21:42.680 --> 21:43.880
-Tired?
-A little.

21:43.960 --> 21:46.280
-Are you excited?
-I'm excited, of course!

21:46.320 --> 21:47.560
Enjoy.

21:47.680 --> 21:51.200
When a young player arrives at Juventus,
in the first few months,

21:51.280 --> 21:54.960
he's all over the place, and don't
realize what they want from him.

21:55.040 --> 21:55.880
GIORGIO CHIELLINI
DEFENDER

21:56.000 --> 21:57.600
Some adapt quickly, some slowly,

21:57.680 --> 21:59.960
It takes some adjusting
in a club like this.

22:00.040 --> 22:05.880
But we must build a team where everyone
pulls in the same direction,

22:05.960 --> 22:07.880
no matter their individual differences

22:07.960 --> 22:12.480
because this is a club
that achieves success

22:12.560 --> 22:16.560
by having a different
dedication than the rest.

22:17.360 --> 22:20.760
We're surprised to know you as a person...

22:20.840 --> 22:24.800
But the best thing
are the shoes with the wheels.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.160
How's your Italian, West?

22:28.240 --> 22:29.920
Are you learning Italian?

22:30.640 --> 22:32.680
-A little bit.
-One step at a time.

22:32.760 --> 22:34.440
One step at a time. More or less.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.080
Do you like pasta?

22:38.160 --> 22:42.760
Food is good in Italy.
If I don't eat well, I can't play.

22:42.840 --> 22:47.000
We throw in a cookie, a brownie,

22:47.080 --> 22:50.720
or a burger, something like this!
Then I'm okay!

22:51.360 --> 22:53.600
-Pizza?
-Yes. I like it.

22:53.680 --> 22:57.920
-Do you know ranch dressing?
-No. I never--

22:58.000 --> 23:02.120
It's a white salsa. It's normally
for salad. If you put it on pizza...

23:03.560 --> 23:05.280
But what you are saying to me?

23:06.360 --> 23:08.720
I'm scared about American dressing.

23:09.640 --> 23:13.680
-We use just olive oil. Nothing more.
-It's amazing.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.440
-Do you like coffee?
-No.

23:15.520 --> 23:19.880
-You don't like Italian coffee?
-If I drink espresso, I shit myself.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.120
Every time I'm in the city
or work around people,

23:27.200 --> 23:28.560
WESTON MCKENNIE
MIDFIELDER

23:28.640 --> 23:31.560
Everyone has, you know,
good energy, kind of like me.

23:31.720 --> 23:34.440
I think it helps me a lot as well

23:35.200 --> 23:37.240
'Cause I don't feel an outcast.

23:37.320 --> 23:39.720
I don't feel like I'm overdoing things,

23:39.800 --> 23:43.880
because people here have the same type of
energy and love, I guess.

23:46.080 --> 23:50.680
Juventus strengthens the midfield
with Arthur from Barcelona

23:50.760 --> 23:54.720
and the young talent
Dejan Kulusevski from Parma.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.520
The search for a striker continues.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.280
SEPTEMBER 15, 2020
5 DAYS TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP

24:00.360 --> 24:02.000
We're playing on Sunday.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.000
We're really in need of a striker.

24:05.080 --> 24:08.800
-Pavel, we need to act fast.
-At all costs.

24:09.360 --> 24:12.200
We need to sign a striker

24:12.280 --> 24:15.680
because on Sunday
we'll play with Cristiano and,

24:16.200 --> 24:20.520
if he can play, Dejan, because Dybala
is out, so we don't even have a sub.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.400
I mean, we need to sign one
tomorrow morning.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.200
While the club explores the market,

24:28.280 --> 24:31.040
the coach tries to make
the younger players confident.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.760
-Were you scared at my age?
-No, never.

24:34.840 --> 24:35.800
Zero, never?

24:35.880 --> 24:36.720
DEJAN KULUSEVSKI
MIDFIELDER

24:36.800 --> 24:38.920
At first it was difficult also for me.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.480
If you believe in your abilities,
then you don't have to fear anything.

24:43.640 --> 24:47.040
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Physically you're better than everyone.

24:47.120 --> 24:51.880
When you'll reach your mental maturity,
then you can go by yourself,

24:51.960 --> 24:53.960
If it's not, then you can't continue.

24:54.040 --> 24:54.880
Yes. Sure.

24:54.960 --> 24:55.960
Your mind is strong.

25:01.520 --> 25:04.880
Pirlo has only 24 hours
before the start of the Serie A season.

25:04.960 --> 25:08.160
He'll have to put all his trust
in his most efficient player.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.440
Good, good, good.

25:09.520 --> 25:12.400
-He trains a lot in the shoot, eh?
-Yes.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.240
And I noticed, also on crosses.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.760
Which is important,

25:17.840 --> 25:21.920
because if you want to play in front,
you need to know how to do that, right?

25:26.440 --> 25:29.240
-Cristiano is a monster. Incredible--
-Yes.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.480
-Yes, he's...
-Every time he gets the ball,

25:31.560 --> 25:34.120
-he does things...
-He misses rarely.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.480
-He's always coordinated.
-Always coordinated when on the ball.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.600
Good, good, good.

25:49.240 --> 25:51.240
-Great.
-Hi, hi.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.240
-How are you? Yes.
-Yes. Easy. Sure.

25:54.040 --> 25:58.400
ALLIANZ STADIUM
SEPTEMBER 20, 2020

25:58.480 --> 26:02.000
Tonight, Pirlo makes his debut
against Ranieri's Sampdoria,

26:02.080 --> 26:05.080
who celebrates his 400th
game as a coach in Serie A.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.680
The old and the newborn,
not even the kid.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.280
-The old and the newborn, right?
-The newborn.

26:10.360 --> 26:14.240
An incredible pairing, one could say,
from a storytelling point of view.

26:18.720 --> 26:21.800
By the way,
another news today, the fans are back.

26:21.880 --> 26:25.680
For now only 1,000 people,
we'll see what happens.

26:25.760 --> 26:29.800
COVID put an unnatural distance
between the team and the fans

26:29.880 --> 26:31.720
but in the first game of the season,

26:31.800 --> 26:34.080
1,000 people are allowed
to go to the stadium.

26:34.160 --> 26:38.560
Millions of other fans will be
watching on TV all over the world,

26:38.640 --> 26:39.760
including Turin.

26:39.880 --> 26:42.840
Tonight, debut with a goal
for Kulusevski, you'll see.

26:42.920 --> 26:45.520
You'll see, he'll score, he'll score.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.560
And maybe Ronaldo will dispel the myth

26:47.640 --> 26:51.120
and score on the first game
of a season since he never does.

27:04.120 --> 27:08.800
I'm a bit worried about the offense,

27:08.880 --> 27:11.200
obviously, like everyone else.

27:12.880 --> 27:17.080
And I'm puzzled, and the fact
that we didn't get a striker

27:17.160 --> 27:19.480
for the first game of the season

27:19.560 --> 27:20.920
is unsettling.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.480
Even though,
maybe we'll find out that Kulusevski

27:23.560 --> 27:26.160
is a great striker and no one knew it.

27:27.240 --> 27:28.840
With only one pure striker,

27:28.960 --> 27:31.480
Pirlo bets
on the newly-arrived Kulusevski,

27:31.560 --> 27:34.520
in a new role next to Ronaldo.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.160
A move that could be risky.

27:39.440 --> 27:43.040
I like having responsibilities,
I like being under pressure.

27:43.120 --> 27:48.000
After each game, there can be criticism.

27:48.080 --> 27:52.720
I went through that as a player,
I'll go through it now as a coach.

28:01.360 --> 28:02.960
-How are you?
-Good. Yes.

28:03.040 --> 28:07.520
Go also deep, let's have a long formation

28:07.600 --> 28:09.240
-if they're all there.
-Yes.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.240
Let's have a long formation.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.560
Do a good warm-up,
you must let me win the game.

28:14.640 --> 28:18.360
If you let me win the game,
I'll take you all to dinner this week.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.680
All paid, you'll eat for free.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.160
-Cooked though.
-No.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.360
With a Michelin star.

28:26.440 --> 28:27.680
Let's have fun.

28:28.520 --> 28:31.960
What counts is to have fun,
to play ball and have fun.

28:36.720 --> 28:38.040
Come on. Together.

28:40.160 --> 28:43.240
High intensity when we lose the ball,
let's keep them there.

28:43.320 --> 28:46.520
We don't need to run,
we need to keep our midfield.

28:46.640 --> 28:50.240
All balls that come out must be ours.
Let's dominate their striker.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.520
They never have to counter-attack.

28:53.160 --> 28:54.920
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.480
Go!

28:59.480 --> 29:00.840
Come on!

29:06.640 --> 29:11.160
We all have different personalities,
so it's a good thing to approach

29:11.240 --> 29:15.160
different people in different ways.

29:15.240 --> 29:20.400
So, perhaps you behave one way with
someone and another way with someone else.

29:20.480 --> 29:24.920
It depends on who's in front of you,
but in the end,

29:25.000 --> 29:27.400
it all should lead to a guideline,

29:27.480 --> 29:31.960
I'm the one who decides, so I need
to bring things together in the end.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.920
It's all ready for Juventus-Sampdoria.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.480
Andrea Pirlo's first game
as a coach of the bianconeri.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.000
Kick off, here we go, go, we began.

29:57.080 --> 29:58.600
-So, enjoy.
-Well done, Aaron.

29:58.680 --> 30:01.720
Ramsey tries to find CR7.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.800
Ronaldo runs towards the goal, he goes.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.760
Ronaldo. Ronaldo! Audero saves.

30:06.840 --> 30:08.800
Corner kick for Juventus.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.800
CR7 close to the first goal.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.760
Good, good, good.

30:16.120 --> 30:19.360
Juventus are still on the attack
with Rabiot. Long ball ahead.

30:19.440 --> 30:23.280
Ramsey touches it for Ronaldo.
Ronaldo runs towards the goal.

30:23.360 --> 30:25.760
The ball goes towards Kulusevski.

30:25.840 --> 30:28.200
Kulusevski!

30:28.280 --> 30:30.560
Juventus is in front!

30:30.640 --> 30:32.240
1-0, to Juventus.

30:45.640 --> 30:50.000
Corner kick for Juventus with Kulusevski,
his cross goes in, the header.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.280
The ball stays there.

30:52.360 --> 30:55.000
McKennie shoots, touched, Bonucci!

30:55.080 --> 30:57.160
The second goal for Juventus.

30:59.280 --> 31:03.760
2-0 for Juve. Leo scored.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.960
Juventus with Bonucci.

31:16.360 --> 31:19.800
Bonucci close to Rabiot.

31:19.880 --> 31:23.960
Rabiot in the middle, tries to change,
Bentancur, through ball for Ramsey.

31:24.040 --> 31:27.040
Ramsey sees Cristiano in the corridor.

31:27.120 --> 31:31.240
Ronaldo, Ronaldo! CR7 closes the game.

31:31.320 --> 31:34.080
Juventus three, Sampdoria nil.

31:36.320 --> 31:38.360
3-0 to Juventus.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.280
-You could have scored three or four.
-Yes.

31:52.360 --> 31:53.960
The game ends here.

31:54.080 --> 31:58.480
Andrea Pirlo debuts in the best
of ways beating Sampdoria 3-0.

31:58.560 --> 31:59.840
A decisive win.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.120
Stay here.

32:07.800 --> 32:11.400
The Juve of today is different
from the one we've seen

32:11.480 --> 32:14.640
in the last few games last season.

32:14.720 --> 32:18.680
It is clear that they want to play,
and have a little they're hungrier.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.160
Perhaps it's Pirlo's hand.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.840
Let's hope, let's say,
they keep playing like this.

32:22.920 --> 32:24.200
Well done, well done.

32:24.280 --> 32:25.720
-Well done.
-Coach!

32:25.800 --> 32:27.200
-Well done.
-Coach!

32:27.880 --> 32:29.080
Coach.

32:38.280 --> 32:41.200
The win was great
and it was a fun watch for the fans.

32:41.280 --> 32:45.520
But the journey
to the tenth title has just begun.

32:46.360 --> 32:49.440
Very positive start to the season
for Pirlo, in my opinion.

32:49.520 --> 32:53.160
What most impressed me,
and I had no doubts about it,

32:53.240 --> 32:56.000
is the style he brought on the bench.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.360
Pirlo is good. He instills calm,

32:58.440 --> 33:01.440
he played football,
so he knows what players should do

33:01.520 --> 33:03.440
on the pitch and how to move.

33:03.520 --> 33:08.520
Honestly, yesterday we saw
a grit we hadn't seen since Conte.

33:09.480 --> 33:13.440
The season started well,
but the team is still setting in.

33:13.520 --> 33:17.080
And most of all,
Pirlo needs another striker.

33:17.960 --> 33:20.040
It's a race against time, at this point.

33:20.120 --> 33:22.440
To find a player at the level of Juventus

33:23.280 --> 33:25.600
with a budget reduced to zero...

33:25.680 --> 33:27.000
GUIDO VACIAGO
JOURNALIST

33:27.080 --> 33:29.640
...by COVID is almost impossible.

33:32.320 --> 33:35.520
Here, situations change every ten minutes.

33:36.280 --> 33:37.440
One must be

33:37.520 --> 33:40.080
relaxed and have some levity

33:40.960 --> 33:44.280
to do this job,

33:44.360 --> 33:46.000
a lot of flexibility,

33:46.800 --> 33:49.920
lots of planning, because you need to have

33:50.000 --> 33:51.880
a plan A, a plan B

33:51.960 --> 33:55.120
and perhaps get to M or N

33:55.200 --> 33:57.520
with alternative plans.

34:02.520 --> 34:03.960
Speaking of competitors,

34:04.040 --> 34:07.920
Guido, Juventus played
on the counter-attack and got Morata

34:08.000 --> 34:09.360
who's good, very good.

34:09.440 --> 34:13.640
He's an international striker,
a striker of absolute value.

34:13.680 --> 34:15.800
What's the key?

34:15.880 --> 34:18.160
We need to understand how Pirlo manages

34:18.280 --> 34:21.080
to add Morata
in the offensive maneuver

34:21.160 --> 34:24.520
of this very interesting Juventus,
which played a fun game

34:24.600 --> 34:26.600
in their first game against Sampdoria.

34:31.600 --> 34:34.560
Álvaro Morata arrived on loan to Juventus

34:34.640 --> 34:37.520
for the first time
from Real Madrid in 2014.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.480
He settled in Turin

34:39.560 --> 34:43.960
and played at a high level before being
recalled to Spain two years later.

34:44.640 --> 34:45.520
How are you?

34:45.600 --> 34:47.680
-All good?
-I'm good, and you?

34:47.800 --> 34:49.760
See you later.

34:49.840 --> 34:52.600
Things have changed here.
It's not the same place.

34:54.600 --> 34:57.160
In four years it all changed.

34:57.320 --> 35:02.560
For sure.
What was missing to be the best club.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.560
-Right?
-See you later.

35:05.960 --> 35:08.640
I knew that it would be like coming home.

35:08.760 --> 35:11.200
It's like I've never left.

35:14.200 --> 35:17.040
The puzzle of the starting 11
is almost over.

35:17.120 --> 35:19.640
The new Juventus begins its journey.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.840
It's a different year for Juventus,

35:24.920 --> 35:28.600
a year of change, of transition, of hope.

35:29.440 --> 35:31.640
There'll be many challenges to face,

35:31.760 --> 35:35.520
and the group of old friends
must be as united as ever.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.040
The future is still to be written,

35:38.120 --> 35:41.160
success or failure is in their hands.

35:41.280 --> 35:42.640
Coach!

35:42.760 --> 35:44.360
Coach!

35:44.440 --> 35:45.920
Coach!

35:47.200 --> 35:50.160
If only Antonio could sing well.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.840
Sarà perché ti amo...

35:52.920 --> 35:54.080
Oh, my!

35:54.160 --> 35:56.840
by Ricchi e Poveri,
you don't know it but...

35:57.520 --> 35:59.040
You'll understand now.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.040
So much confusion

36:03.120 --> 36:05.160
It must be because I love you

36:05.200 --> 36:07.080
It is a feeling

36:07.160 --> 36:09.040
That grows very slow

36:09.120 --> 36:12.360
Hold me tight
And be close to me

36:12.440 --> 36:16.160
If I feel good
I'll be more Juventino

36:16.200 --> 36:19.480
And if you fly, you know
You'll get higher and all

36:19.560 --> 36:22.680
And if I fly with you

36:24.840 --> 36:29.480
I want to see a team
that wants to get to the result.

36:29.560 --> 36:30.960
Quicker with the ball.

36:32.400 --> 36:36.160
Let it move freely,
let's attack the space.

36:36.200 --> 36:40.680
You're a winner. What's more important
than win every game and training.
