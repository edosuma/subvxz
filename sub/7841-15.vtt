00:41.358 --> 00:43.346
Bart, it's me!

00:44.858 --> 00:48.731
I'm Lord Evilton from
the Angelica Button books.

00:49.168 --> 00:51.090
The last book in
the series goes on sale

00:51.091 --> 00:53.498
at midnight and we're going
to go stand in line.

00:53.499 --> 00:55.926
Wait in line for a book?!

00:55.927 --> 00:58.271
- You tell 'em Bart says hey.
- Come on, boy.

00:58.272 --> 00:59.713
All the nerds are doing it.

00:59.714 --> 01:03.043
I'm not a nerd.
I'm a jock who's too cool for sports.

01:04.456 --> 01:06.830
- It's the final book!
- I wonder what happens?

01:06.834 --> 01:09.075
Maybe the Sandrux is the Narcolops.

01:09.076 --> 01:11.377
I read a rumor Spider-man's in it.

01:11.375 --> 01:12.319
Shut up! Shut up!

01:12.319 --> 01:14.363
This is a spoiler-free zone.

01:18.065 --> 01:20.633
Nice Angelica Button costume, Lisa.

01:20.637 --> 01:22.280
Although...

01:22.298 --> 01:25.460
the gryphon on your coat
of arms is facing left not right.

01:25.476 --> 01:28.853
And FYI, Angelica wears
two tortoise shell barrs.

01:28.857 --> 01:30.043
Nice try, though.

01:30.048 --> 01:33.751
I based my costume on the books,
not the movies.

01:40.005 --> 01:42.840
Okay, I'm going to hand
out colored bracelets.

01:42.848 --> 01:44.731
The color on your bracelet
will determine...

01:44.735 --> 01:45.872
Move or die!

01:50.327 --> 01:51.622
It's for my kid!

01:51.626 --> 01:52.883
Eureka!

01:55.608 --> 01:57.160
Now read it to me!

01:57.838 --> 02:00.931
"The Dark Lord has summoned you"
said the withered troll.

02:00.935 --> 02:03.341
Do the character voices!

02:03.905 --> 02:06.141
"And bring your cloak.

02:06.148 --> 02:09.919
The torture room can be
frightfully chilly."

02:09.928 --> 02:12.162
Angelica's first kiss, da-da-da.

02:12.177 --> 02:13.962
Subplot about her cat, who cares?

02:13.965 --> 02:17.541
Professor Skizzletwitch is a Were-bear,
and, uh, no, no, he's not.

02:17.548 --> 02:20.652
Maluicious Krubb is actually
Kraluicious Mubb.

02:20.685 --> 02:23.901
All is lost, Angelica uses the spell
she learned in chapter six.

02:23.906 --> 02:26.260
Magic, magic, magic,
all is won.

02:31.147 --> 02:33.491
Well, that's our book for the year.

02:33.498 --> 02:35.551
I think we've earned some TV.

02:35.557 --> 02:37.062
TV! TV! TV!

02:37.077 --> 02:40.540
But kids, I want you in bed by 3:00 a.m.

02:40.548 --> 02:42.890
Hey, somebody's got to be the bad guy.

02:42.896 --> 02:46.060
But I don't understand,
how could he have murdered his wife

02:46.067 --> 02:49.013
if he was making
a phone call 3,000 miles away?

02:49.015 --> 02:50.941
Well, maybe he reached out done

02:51.328 --> 02:52.900
and killed someone.

02:57.926 --> 03:00.262
I saw this.
He trained his dog to do it.

03:02.186 --> 03:04.712
Up next,
which former Friends star

03:04.715 --> 03:07.500
is speaking out against
adult illiteracy?

03:07.605 --> 03:09.092
It's Lisa Kudrow.

03:10.208 --> 03:11.790
Stop saying things, Bart.

03:11.796 --> 03:13.340
That's the TV's job.

03:14.477 --> 03:16.091
And the First Lady
has agreed

03:16.108 --> 03:18.471
to sit on the egg
until it hatches.

03:18.477 --> 03:19.503
More after this.

03:22.428 --> 03:23.981
See that?
That's talent.

03:24.005 --> 03:25.532
You think you got it?
You don't.

03:25.547 --> 03:28.401
'Cause only I can teach it and
I ain't taught you, so you don't

03:28.407 --> 03:31.603
The Chazz Busby Ballet Academy
is coming to Springfield.

03:31.606 --> 03:32.953
Auditions are Monday.

03:32.957 --> 03:34.061
Callbacks are Tuesday.

03:34.067 --> 03:36.021
Wednesday,
you see I'm a heartless bastard.

03:36.026 --> 03:37.852
Thursday you realize
you love me, damn it.

03:37.855 --> 03:39.150
Friday, we're closed.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.260
You're fired.

03:40.267 --> 03:40.950
You're her.

03:40.956 --> 03:42.230
Jump, dance, love.

03:42.238 --> 03:45.593
A ballet academy here
in Springfield?

03:45.595 --> 03:46.770
Move over, Europe!

03:46.778 --> 03:48.861
I didn't know you cared
about ballet.

03:48.865 --> 03:52.501
Lisa, have I ever shown you
my Shattered Dreams Box?

03:52.508 --> 03:53.270
No.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.711
It's upstairs in
my Disappointment Closet.

03:57.325 --> 03:59.451
There were so many things I wanted to

03:59.468 --> 04:02.163
do in life that I never got
a chance to do:

04:02.167 --> 04:04.401
doctor, safecracker,

04:04.407 --> 04:06.712
stethoscope sales lady.

04:06.716 --> 04:08.440
None came to pass.

04:08.447 --> 04:10.641
But the thing I really wanted to be,

04:10.646 --> 04:12.390
ever since I was little,

04:12.487 --> 04:14.390
was a ballerina.

04:14.426 --> 04:15.500
So what happened?

04:15.506 --> 04:18.072
My bosoms came in
and ruined my balance.

04:18.076 --> 04:19.473
Really? How?

04:19.476 --> 04:21.201
They came in one at a time.

04:21.204 --> 04:23.590
- Oh... do you think mine...?
- No.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.442
I'm pretty sure you'll have
your dad's boobs.

04:29.538 --> 04:32.543
Mom, it's not too late
to un-shatter your dream.

04:32.557 --> 04:35.122
Martha Graham danced
well into her 70s.

04:35.137 --> 04:38.052
You mean she danced well,
into her 70s?

04:38.058 --> 04:40.543
Or she danced,
well into her 70s?

04:40.546 --> 04:42.322
Well, she danced into her 70s.

04:42.326 --> 04:44.210
I think you've got a point.

04:44.218 --> 04:46.662
Homie, I'm gonna be a dancer!

04:46.677 --> 04:47.781
Go-go or boring?

04:47.788 --> 04:49.561
- Boring!
- Oh...

04:54.686 --> 04:56.082
Okay, ladies, listen up:

04:56.087 --> 04:58.123
Forget everything you've
ever learned about ballet...

04:58.185 --> 04:58.850
good.

04:58.858 --> 05:00.522
Now, from Bolshoi Fifth Position,

05:00.525 --> 05:01.870
give me a Battement Glisse,

05:01.876 --> 05:04.331
a Double Changement,
two Swan Lake FouettÃ©s,

05:04.338 --> 05:06.191
then finish with
a Grand Pas De Chat.

05:08.477 --> 05:10.510
Now show me what you got, uh...

05:10.516 --> 05:12.662
Simpson, comma, Marge.

05:25.077 --> 05:28.781
I haven't seen dancing like that since
my Broadway show Dancing Like That.

05:28.787 --> 05:29.613
Closed in a week.

05:29.617 --> 05:31.022
Too smart for the corndog crowd,

05:31.026 --> 05:32.452
too dumb for the bagel bunch.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.292
You keep it up, kid.

05:33.297 --> 05:34.361
You got something.

05:35.786 --> 05:38.993
Son, while your mother and
little mother are out,

05:38.995 --> 05:42.552
I'm gonna let you in on a deep,
dark family secret.

05:42.558 --> 05:43.842
You have a drinking problem?

05:43.847 --> 05:45.913
I said secret.

05:46.998 --> 05:50.231
Have you ever wondered what
I do in that locked room?

05:50.246 --> 05:51.242
Gay out?

05:51.247 --> 05:53.631
Well, wonder no more!

05:55.648 --> 05:57.121
Beef jerky!

05:57.126 --> 05:59.021
The queen of all the jerkys!

05:59.025 --> 06:00.253
That's right.

06:00.258 --> 06:02.321
Now, I'll cut and you soak.

06:06.345 --> 06:09.122
Dad, marinating with you is cool.

06:09.417 --> 06:10.903
Thanks, son.

06:12.657 --> 06:14.563
Some of that is cow blood.

06:16.556 --> 06:19.721
Look, Lise!
I'm as supple as ever!

06:21.946 --> 06:23.771
It won't go down.

06:28.417 --> 06:29.781
Marge, Marge, Marge...

06:29.788 --> 06:31.802
you know what they say,
those who cannot do...

06:31.806 --> 06:33.943
- Teach?
- No, they go home.

06:33.948 --> 06:35.553
How can they teach if they can't do?

06:35.565 --> 06:36.802
Get out!

06:39.855 --> 06:42.181
You can't talk to my mom like that.

06:42.188 --> 06:43.193
Who the hell...

06:43.195 --> 06:44.991
taught you to stand like that?

06:44.997 --> 06:46.393
This is how I always stand

06:46.396 --> 06:48.541
when I tell adults what
they should be doing.

06:48.545 --> 06:50.430
You have naturally perfect posture.

06:50.436 --> 06:52.852
I rarely say this, but,
how would you like to become

06:52.855 --> 06:55.201
to a paying student at my dance academy?

06:55.208 --> 06:57.272
Uh, I don't know, I...

06:57.275 --> 06:58.732
We accept!

07:08.595 --> 07:10.500
I'm sorry, I got confused.

07:10.506 --> 07:11.990
You don't get to be "confused."

07:12.004 --> 07:14.405
Not till you've won six Tonys,
gone into rehab,

07:14.406 --> 07:16.447
married your plastic surgeon, retired,

07:16.445 --> 07:19.649
and then un-retired in a special little
show called Woman of the Year...

07:19.649 --> 07:21.192
you can't, uh...

07:21.608 --> 07:23.071
Hey, I forget where I'm going with this.

07:23.075 --> 07:24.451
Take a break, people.

07:25.548 --> 07:27.712
Eh, eh, eh, en pointe!

07:30.587 --> 07:32.293
This is so hard.

07:32.295 --> 07:33.122
Get used to it.

07:33.128 --> 07:35.992
We balerinas are under constant
pressure to stay focused,

07:35.997 --> 07:38.350
skinny, graceful and skinny.

07:38.355 --> 07:39.582
How do you cope with it?

07:39.586 --> 07:41.122
You find out what works you.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.683
For some people it might be yoga,

07:42.686 --> 07:44.183
for others, meditation.

07:44.886 --> 07:47.841
But for every ballerina in the world,
it's cigarettes.

07:51.086 --> 07:52.373
Cigarettes?!

07:52.386 --> 07:53.871
They can kill you.

07:53.877 --> 07:55.400
They did a whole episode about it on

07:55.406 --> 07:56.973
The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.

07:56.978 --> 07:59.092
Zack tried to impress a girl by smoking,

07:59.107 --> 08:01.261
but she went for Cody instead.

08:01.265 --> 08:03.523
Zack's life wasn't so sweet then.

08:04.016 --> 08:05.891
If God didn't want ballerinas to smoke,

08:05.897 --> 08:07.422
how come I can do this?

08:14.878 --> 08:15.681
No!

08:15.687 --> 08:17.000
All I need to stay focused

08:17.007 --> 08:19.103
is good old-fashioned fresh air.

08:19.376 --> 08:21.902
Nothing like fresh air.

08:24.078 --> 08:26.190
Fresh air.

08:31.158 --> 08:33.131
Horrible, horrible, horrible...

08:33.138 --> 08:34.962
no longer describes
your dancing, Lisa.

08:34.967 --> 08:36.200
You're good, kid!

08:38.794 --> 08:41.280
I've gotten better since this morning.

08:41.284 --> 08:42.741
How could that have happened?

08:42.746 --> 08:46.172
Maybe it's all the secondhand
"focus" and "pep" you are inhaling.

08:48.998 --> 08:51.440
They don't call these
"dancer sticks" for nothin'.

08:51.447 --> 08:53.612
I thought they were cancer sticks.

08:54.736 --> 08:57.311
I dan't dear dou!

08:57.318 --> 09:00.491
My Hindu friend,
this is a chance for your Kwik-E-Mart to

09:00.496 --> 09:04.042
get in on the ground floor of
a delicious new taste sensation.

09:04.047 --> 09:05.470
You talk a good game,

09:05.478 --> 09:07.390
but do you have
the product to back it up?

09:07.398 --> 09:09.931
Step into our Jerkatorium.

09:11.936 --> 09:12.832
What the...!

09:12.848 --> 09:14.063
Where's our jerky?

09:14.075 --> 09:15.763
You have wasted my time!

09:15.778 --> 09:19.043
You have made
a very powerless enemy.

09:19.156 --> 09:20.650
Good day and be well!

09:20.656 --> 09:21.643
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

09:21.656 --> 09:24.293
You haven't seen our
PowerPoint presentation...

09:24.297 --> 09:25.142
Bart?

09:26.595 --> 09:29.271
"J," just the product you need.

09:29.276 --> 09:31.532
"E," excellent value.

09:31.535 --> 09:33.672
"R," retailer's dream.

09:33.677 --> 09:34.493
"K..."

09:34.496 --> 09:36.591
You can skip the "K" and the "Y."

09:36.597 --> 09:40.471
I do not thank you
and I will not come again.

09:42.735 --> 09:44.471
Who could have done this?

09:44.475 --> 09:46.882
Well, something chewed
through the cellar door

09:46.886 --> 09:48.922
and the floor is covered
with paw prints...

09:48.926 --> 09:51.150
is can only mean one thing:

09:51.167 --> 09:52.922
Flanders, you ate my jerky!

09:52.927 --> 09:56.083
As the oak said to the beagle,
you're barkin' up the wrong tree.

09:56.085 --> 09:58.322
I spent the whole morning
blacking out the "goshes"

09:58.327 --> 10:00.051
and "darns" in these Hardy Boys books.

10:00.056 --> 10:02.031
I know you ate my jerky

10:02.037 --> 10:05.972
just like I ate
your earthquake supplies.

10:05.977 --> 10:07.951
Dad, look!
Raccoons!

10:09.967 --> 10:11.843
You stay right here.

10:11.846 --> 10:13.252
Okily dokily!

10:16.106 --> 10:17.591
Ah! "heck, darn."

10:17.726 --> 10:19.433
I don't think so.

10:22.018 --> 10:23.663
Lisa...

10:23.668 --> 10:26.063
Lisa Simpson...

10:27.088 --> 10:29.083
Time for a smoke.

10:29.138 --> 10:32.363
Look, everyone knows that
cigarettes are where flavor lives

10:32.368 --> 10:34.073
and a cool choice for a hot night.

10:34.075 --> 10:35.832
But they're for losers!

10:35.858 --> 10:37.052
Losers?

10:37.058 --> 10:38.371
You mean losers like...

10:38.378 --> 10:41.422
Simone de Beauvoir, Margaret Mead,

10:41.458 --> 10:44.553
Queen Elizabeth I, Lauren Bacall...

10:44.606 --> 10:46.893
My feminist heroes!

10:46.905 --> 10:49.400
Don't forget me
Lillian Hellman!

10:49.405 --> 10:54.222
Smoking gave me the energy I needed
to write plays and inventiveness!

10:54.226 --> 10:57.363
Bring out the Hellman's,
and bring out the best.

10:57.368 --> 10:58.800
Puff with us!

10:58.808 --> 11:00.531
Puff with us!

11:00.545 --> 11:02.690
Puff with us!

11:12.678 --> 11:16.123
Yeah, that's it,
don't be shy.

11:16.128 --> 11:19.563
Enjoy your jerky laced
with sleeping pills.

11:19.777 --> 11:22.070
Nobody outwits Homer Simpson.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.811
Hey, they're not sleepy.

11:25.216 --> 11:28.440
Just turning fuzzy.

11:28.445 --> 11:30.480
Homer, you ate their jerky.

11:30.485 --> 11:32.222
I thought this might happen,

11:32.227 --> 11:35.820
so I brought the best weapon
to operate while drugged:

11:35.856 --> 11:37.763
a crossbow.

11:50.655 --> 11:52.271
No!

11:59.156 --> 12:02.150
Chazz Busby says
you're really making progress!

12:02.155 --> 12:03.850
Do you need more leg warmers?

12:03.858 --> 12:05.813
No, stop buying me leg warmers!

12:05.828 --> 12:07.713
I'm already wearing six pairs!

12:07.718 --> 12:10.323
Well, the important thing is,
someday,

12:10.327 --> 12:12.532
I'll be watching my little Marge

12:12.536 --> 12:14.332
dancing at Lincoln Center.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.963
Lisa, Mom. I'm Lisa.

12:15.966 --> 12:17.963
Of course, you're Lisa.

12:17.966 --> 12:21.400
Lisa the dancing Marge girl.

12:21.695 --> 12:23.220
Dad, you never win a

12:23.228 --> 12:24.673
fight with animals.

12:24.678 --> 12:26.610
Remember when you lost
that war with the worms?

12:26.616 --> 12:27.910
That wasn't a defeat,

12:27.918 --> 12:29.581
it was a phased withdrawal.

12:29.587 --> 12:32.420
Oh, yeah?
They made you build this statue.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.193
When you cut 'em, they multiply.

12:36.196 --> 12:37.632
I can't fight that!

12:37.655 --> 12:40.973
Now, let's take care
of those raccoons.

12:46.737 --> 12:49.763
Aw, they're using the jerky
to feed their family.

12:49.767 --> 12:52.033
Look, there's a Homer and a Bart

12:52.035 --> 12:53.653
and a Marge and a Lisa.

12:53.668 --> 12:57.431
Aw, they even share
my views on parenting!

12:58.248 --> 13:00.390
Enjoy your jerky,
little critters,

13:00.398 --> 13:02.773
and, one day, you'll
grow up to be people.

13:02.776 --> 13:04.430
Bart, get some more jerky

13:04.438 --> 13:06.151
for man's new best friend.

13:15.108 --> 13:16.662
When's our next break?

13:16.675 --> 13:18.673
When the big cigarette hits 9.

13:20.148 --> 13:21.933
All right, that was pretty good

13:21.938 --> 13:23.973
for uncoordinated hippopotamuses.

13:23.978 --> 13:25.132
Hit the river, ladies.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.393
Go ahead, have a wallow.

13:35.366 --> 13:36.513
What am I doing?

13:36.515 --> 13:39.421
I don't need second hand
smoke to do ballet...

13:40.765 --> 13:43.021
I need firsthand smoke!

13:46.908 --> 13:48.132
Lisa!

13:48.136 --> 13:49.052
Give me that!

13:55.365 --> 13:58.001
I can't believe how easy it is

13:58.006 --> 14:00.382
in this country
to get cigarettes.

14:01.756 --> 14:04.431
I can't believe you
were smoking.

14:04.435 --> 14:06.510
Did you know the "sturgeon" general

14:06.517 --> 14:08.171
said you're not supposed to?

14:08.176 --> 14:10.090
A "sturgeon" is a fish.

14:10.095 --> 14:13.003
And a very wise fish he is!

14:14.528 --> 14:17.142
Marge, I'm taking Lisa out
of that stupid...

14:17.146 --> 14:18.011
What the...?

14:20.395 --> 14:21.671
Oh, Homie,

14:21.677 --> 14:23.930
I've been so happy lately.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.470
I'm completely fulfilled,

14:25.478 --> 14:28.441
both as a mother and
a fan of youth ballet!

14:28.446 --> 14:30.841
Now what did you want
to say to me?

14:30.875 --> 14:33.553
Are you sure you want
Lisa to keep dancing?

14:33.557 --> 14:35.542
There's nothing that makes
a mother's heart

14:35.545 --> 14:38.511
soar more than seeing
child take wing.

14:38.517 --> 14:41.060
Look at me, I'm glowing!

14:41.076 --> 14:42.101
Maybe you're drunk.

14:42.115 --> 14:45.021
Homie, Lisa's dancing has made

14:45.026 --> 14:47.441
me really, really, happy.

14:51.306 --> 14:52.690
Okay.

14:53.688 --> 14:56.543
Oh, fatherhood hurts my brain.

14:56.548 --> 14:57.071
Dad!

14:57.656 --> 14:59.212
Dad, a little help?

14:59.215 --> 15:00.771
You're on your own.

15:04.026 --> 15:06.091
Because it means so much
to your mother,

15:06.095 --> 15:07.520
you can keep doing ballet.

15:07.528 --> 15:09.391
But you have to stop smoking,

15:09.398 --> 15:10.853
including secondhand!

15:10.856 --> 15:12.123
That's easy for you to say.

15:12.136 --> 15:14.780
You've never had
to be thin and focused.

15:14.846 --> 15:15.993
What'd you say?

15:15.995 --> 15:18.751
I'm just saying it's gonna be hard
for me to quit,

15:18.755 --> 15:20.853
especially before the recital.

15:20.858 --> 15:22.773
I thought you might have
trouble with this.

15:22.775 --> 15:25.901
That's why I'm assigning someone
to keep watch over you.

15:25.905 --> 15:27.953
Someone you'd never expect.

15:27.957 --> 15:29.201
- Is it Bart?
- D'oh!

15:29.257 --> 15:30.361
Come on out, boy.

15:33.466 --> 15:34.850
For the next three days,

15:34.858 --> 15:38.002
I'm gonna stick to you like
waffle syrup on a shag rug.

15:38.007 --> 15:39.971
I'm gonna be on you like fish stink

15:39.976 --> 15:41.090
on a Gloucester dog.

15:41.097 --> 15:42.882
I'm gonna be all over you like...

15:42.897 --> 15:44.503
where'd she go?

15:46.736 --> 15:48.902
Okay, everybody!
Dress rehearsal!

15:56.138 --> 15:59.082
Hey, I'm still paying
for that nose!

15:59.096 --> 16:00.362
Lisa, the last time I checked,

16:00.365 --> 16:01.760
this was not Worldwide Wrestling.

16:01.766 --> 16:03.311
And I checked five minutes ago.

16:07.905 --> 16:10.502
Hey Lisa, come on over.

16:10.505 --> 16:13.140
I can't... I promised I wouldn't.

16:13.147 --> 16:14.413
If you don't breathe it,

16:14.415 --> 16:16.673
that smoke might go
into a baby.

16:17.306 --> 16:19.331
Well, since you cared enough

16:19.338 --> 16:21.141
to apply peer pressure...

16:23.025 --> 16:24.410
There you go. Awesome.
You go, girl.

16:24.416 --> 16:26.421
Much better.
That's it, yeah.

16:37.438 --> 16:38.922
Yello.

16:39.167 --> 16:40.482
She what?!

16:40.517 --> 16:41.882
Oh, my God!

16:41.887 --> 16:43.921
Well, I'm going to settle
this once and for all!

16:43.938 --> 16:46.093
Meet me at
the place we discussed.

16:46.096 --> 16:48.011
- Who was that?
- Wrong number.

16:52.767 --> 16:54.411
Five min ladies.

17:00.335 --> 17:02.512
Okay, Bart, it's time
for Operation:

17:02.515 --> 17:03.823
Crazy-Plan.

17:03.838 --> 17:06.061
Step one: we chuck
the raccoon in there.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.212
What if someone catches him?

17:07.218 --> 17:07.873
Don't worry.

17:07.876 --> 17:10.843
I have a perfect way
to conceal his identity.

17:15.825 --> 17:17.672
Okay, now go, boy!

17:33.077 --> 17:35.291
Not keys, cigarettes!

17:37.915 --> 17:41.062
Yeah, that's what I mean.

17:45.145 --> 17:48.012
Okay, now we get rid
of the cigarettes.

17:48.116 --> 17:50.362
Lord, I could use a smoke.

17:51.888 --> 17:53.551
Thank god.

17:53.905 --> 17:54.991
Cigarette?

17:55.025 --> 17:56.821
Can't. I'm pregnant.

17:56.855 --> 17:58.720
Uh, one more favor?

18:06.398 --> 18:08.071
Wow, what a great first act.

18:08.107 --> 18:10.080
I hope Sleeping Beauty

18:10.087 --> 18:11.451
never wakes up.

18:11.496 --> 18:14.663
Good, that's so hot.
Good job. Great.

18:15.968 --> 18:16.972
My cigarettes!

18:17.017 --> 18:18.360
What happened
to my cigarettes?!

18:20.728 --> 18:21.710
Found one!

18:22.007 --> 18:23.150
That's your finger!

18:23.158 --> 18:24.561
I don't care!

18:42.887 --> 18:45.862
Watch your hoof,
you blue-ribbon sow.

18:45.876 --> 18:48.373
I'll spit on your grave,
grandma!

18:50.915 --> 18:53.052
Oh, no!
My appetite's coming back!

18:57.936 --> 18:59.382
I haven't seen crap like this

18:59.388 --> 19:00.703
since my Broadway show:

19:00.707 --> 19:01.603
Crap Like This.

19:01.605 --> 19:02.912
Ran for five years.

19:02.917 --> 19:04.581
We can smoke the programs!

19:08.976 --> 19:10.542
I can smoke my hair!

19:13.656 --> 19:15.741
Maybe there's gum
under the seats!

19:18.467 --> 19:20.360
All right, that's enough!

19:20.365 --> 19:22.260
I want to talk about
a horrible practice

19:22.268 --> 19:24.341
afflicting millions of Americans.

19:24.366 --> 19:26.822
For years we've known
how dangerous it is.

19:26.827 --> 19:28.231
It stunts your growth.

19:28.238 --> 19:30.370
And it's marketed
to children.

19:30.398 --> 19:32.573
I'm talking about ballet.

19:32.585 --> 19:33.992
I'll smoke to that!

19:35.036 --> 19:38.173
Ballet is unnatural and
unfair to women.

19:38.176 --> 19:40.630
I shall now cast off the shoes

19:40.637 --> 19:41.781
of oppression!

19:45.478 --> 19:47.373
You'll never take down
big ballet!

19:47.376 --> 19:49.613
Never!
Now good day!

20:05.485 --> 20:08.430
This is my favorite family tradition...

20:08.438 --> 20:11.071
ice cream after
a botched recital.

20:11.077 --> 20:13.272
And I'm happy
to be smoke-free,

20:13.277 --> 20:15.552
thanks to these children's
nicotine patches.

20:15.578 --> 20:19.401
And I realize it's wrong to
try to live your career dreams

20:19.406 --> 20:20.742
through your children.

20:20.747 --> 20:22.143
Does that mean I can stop training

20:22.148 --> 20:23.160
to be a Mexican wrestler?

20:23.167 --> 20:24.210
No!

20:25.327 --> 20:28.090
Now practice preening
to the crowd, El Guapo.

20:31.887 --> 20:33.733
Come on, preen harder!

20:33.736 --> 20:35.491
Make them hate you!

20:35.497 --> 20:38.833
You feed on their hatred and
you are so hungry!
