00:03.154 --> 00:06.312
_

00:06.337 --> 00:08.590
_

00:15.392 --> 00:17.720
"Me, Myself,
and O" skyrocketed to number three

00:17.752 --> 00:18.747
on Amazon last night.

00:18.773 --> 00:20.773
- Oh, my God. Really?
- Yes.

00:20.798 --> 00:24.842
This Aubrey Alexis mystery is
causing a social media frenzy.

00:24.867 --> 00:27.138
"My Perfect O" is trending right now.

00:27.162 --> 00:29.655
Can you imagine how many
orgasms she's had a hand in?

00:29.680 --> 00:31.022
- She?
- Oh, right. Ew.

00:31.047 --> 00:34.426
This is causing quite a stir.

00:34.451 --> 00:37.017
I never expected this
book to actually sell.

00:37.042 --> 00:38.711
"The Today Show" called.

00:38.736 --> 00:40.396
Charlie Rose personally called.

00:40.421 --> 00:42.455
Everyone wants to
interview Aubrey Alexis.

00:42.480 --> 00:43.946
I'm afraid that's impossible.

00:43.971 --> 00:45.313
This is absurd.

00:45.338 --> 00:46.637
It's time she dropped the nom de plume

00:46.662 --> 00:48.862
and reveal herself, at least to me.

00:48.887 --> 00:50.816
Diana, I signed a strict NDA.

00:50.841 --> 00:53.200
Charlie Rose is just going to
have to use his imagination

00:53.225 --> 00:54.519
like everyone else.

00:54.544 --> 00:56.711
Trust me,
you do not want to know what is lurking

00:56.736 --> 00:58.136
inside the imagination of Charlie Rose.

00:58.161 --> 00:59.746
Oh, wow.

00:59.771 --> 01:03.556
Aubrey just got invited to read
at the Ladies Who Lust benefit

01:03.581 --> 01:04.906
- tomorrow night.
- What is that?

01:04.931 --> 01:07.233
The literary icons of
the sexual revolution

01:07.258 --> 01:08.267
throw it every year.

01:08.293 --> 01:09.759
What are they raising money for?

01:09.784 --> 01:10.947
Next year's benefit.

01:16.310 --> 01:19.322
Well,
clearly Aubrey can't read at that event.

01:24.763 --> 01:27.987
The bigger this book becomes,
the more dangerous it is for us.

01:28.012 --> 01:31.509
Can you imagine if her fans
found out that this young woman

01:31.534 --> 01:34.126
that they've been identifying with is...

01:34.261 --> 01:35.418
Him?

01:35.443 --> 01:36.911
And that's photoshopped.

01:36.936 --> 01:40.181
If the truth gets out,
it won't just kill the sales

01:40.206 --> 01:41.322
of "Me, Myself, and O."

01:41.347 --> 01:43.513
It'll endanger the entire
"Crown of Kings" franchise,

01:43.538 --> 01:47.001
which would be a
disaster for the company.

- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:54.740 --> 01:56.164
To Aubrey Alexis.

01:56.189 --> 01:57.340
Whoever she is.

01:57.365 --> 01:58.431
Yeah!

01:58.456 --> 01:59.588
Whoo.

02:00.865 --> 02:03.065
Elizabeth Gilbert has
been tweeting so much

02:03.090 --> 02:05.257
that "Vulture" thinks
she's Aubrey Alexis.

02:05.282 --> 02:07.967
I'd like to eat, pray,
strangle that woman.

02:07.992 --> 02:09.889
"Jezebel" thinks it's Gillian Flynn.

02:09.914 --> 02:11.504
She denied it a full 24 hours

02:11.529 --> 02:13.977
and 20,000 new Instagram
followers later.

02:14.002 --> 02:16.744
How many more people are
gonna take credit for my work?

02:16.769 --> 02:18.326
Consider it a good thing.

02:18.352 --> 02:19.754
It's only boosting sales.

02:19.779 --> 02:21.873
Right, and it's your name on the check.

02:21.897 --> 02:24.167
Plus we've had so many
celebrities offer to read

02:24.192 --> 02:26.249
for Aubrey at the
Ladies Who Lust benefit.

02:26.274 --> 02:27.362
Really? Who?

02:27.387 --> 02:28.486
Well, three choices:

02:28.511 --> 02:30.778
Sarah Silverman, Tavi Gevinson,

02:30.803 --> 02:32.006
and Gwyneth Paltrow.

02:32.031 --> 02:33.502
Gwyneth Paltrow?

02:33.527 --> 02:34.960
That could be huge.

02:34.985 --> 02:35.943
You get Gwenny,

02:35.968 --> 02:39.192
You. Me. Turks. Caicos.

02:39.217 --> 02:40.303
Oh.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.549
Great.

02:47.389 --> 02:48.621
I couldn't put it down.

02:48.646 --> 02:50.052
Except for, like, eight different places

02:50.076 --> 02:51.725
where I needed both hands free.

02:51.751 --> 02:53.901
Who is this writer,
and why does she understand me

02:53.926 --> 02:55.026
better than I understand myself?

02:55.051 --> 02:56.631
She's definitely tapped into something.

02:56.657 --> 02:58.382
- Mm.
- And at the right moment.

02:58.407 --> 03:00.514
No, it's not about swiping
right and sniffing poppers.

03:00.539 --> 03:02.273
It is about owning our own pleasure

03:02.297 --> 03:03.133
without a man.

03:03.158 --> 03:04.765
Wait, people are still doing poppers?

03:04.790 --> 03:06.171
- Oh, yeah.
- You know, it's interesting

03:06.196 --> 03:08.342
how scientists are now
challenging the theory

03:08.368 --> 03:10.910
that the female orgasm is
designed for pair-bonding

03:10.935 --> 03:13.942
only so women can get attached
and form stable partnerships.

03:13.967 --> 03:15.022
Ugh, finally.

03:15.047 --> 03:16.330
I mean, some of the
best orgasms I've had

03:16.355 --> 03:17.990
were with the most unstable partners.

03:18.015 --> 03:19.659
- Until you.
- Aw.

03:19.684 --> 03:21.885
Seriously, I've had way
better sex with guys

03:21.909 --> 03:22.979
that I've hate-banged.

03:23.005 --> 03:23.871
What about you?

03:23.896 --> 03:25.608
Oh, well, you know me.

03:25.632 --> 03:28.474
The more unattached,
the more uninhibited.

03:28.499 --> 03:29.418
- Oh.
- Right?

03:29.442 --> 03:31.376
Get me off twice then call me an Uber.

03:31.402 --> 03:33.505
Get me off three times and
you can call me anything.

03:35.714 --> 03:37.902
Something's vibrating.

03:37.927 --> 03:40.865
Yes, and it is not what you
left in my call room bunk bed

03:40.890 --> 03:41.998
last weekend.

03:42.023 --> 03:44.027
This is Dr. Horowitz. I was paged.

03:44.052 --> 03:47.505
Okay, um, can I make, like,
a "Me, Myself, and O" confession?

03:47.530 --> 03:48.583
Mm.

03:48.609 --> 03:51.338
Max is the first man that's
ever made me orgasm from sex.

03:51.363 --> 03:52.940
Both: Ooh.

03:53.149 --> 03:55.932
Yes, I mean, as a doctor,
he really understands the depths

03:55.957 --> 03:57.654
of our complex female anatomy.

03:57.679 --> 03:59.010
Like lesbian sex?

03:59.035 --> 04:00.595
Yes, but with much less talking.

04:00.620 --> 04:02.827
Okay, can I make a confession?

04:02.852 --> 04:03.939
Oh, yes.

04:03.964 --> 04:06.164
Every time I go to...

04:06.189 --> 04:07.595
- Beat around your bush?
- That.

04:07.620 --> 04:08.545
Mm-hmm. Yep.

04:08.570 --> 04:10.066
I think about Thad

04:10.091 --> 04:11.827
and then I remember that he's dead,

04:11.852 --> 04:13.256
and I feel like I...

04:13.281 --> 04:14.634
A necrophiliac.

04:14.659 --> 04:15.692
No!

04:15.717 --> 04:17.786
No, I... I lose my...

04:17.810 --> 04:18.904
Lady boner!

04:18.930 --> 04:19.809
Yes.

04:19.834 --> 04:21.433
I have to get back to the hospital

04:21.458 --> 04:23.212
and extract a LEGO sheriff
from someone's rectum.

04:23.237 --> 04:24.642
- Ooh.
- Yes.

04:24.667 --> 04:26.962
Okay, but you better text
us if that's someone famous.

04:26.987 --> 04:27.891
- Absolutely.
- Great.

04:27.915 --> 04:29.123
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

04:29.148 --> 04:31.318
People are really into
butt stuff these days.

04:33.199 --> 04:35.816
So who exactly was that in there?

04:35.841 --> 04:39.332
Was that 26-year-old
Liza or 40-year-old Liza?

04:39.357 --> 04:41.017
Definitely the 26 year old.

04:41.042 --> 04:43.427
Good. Had me worried for a minute.

04:43.452 --> 04:45.486
Yeah, the 40 year old has
a very limited resume.

04:45.511 --> 04:46.501
Oh, yeah?

04:46.526 --> 04:48.106
How limited are we talking about here?

04:48.132 --> 04:50.498
I lost my v-card freshman year to my TA,

04:50.523 --> 04:53.040
then I met David, and now you.

04:53.445 --> 04:55.012
Wait.

04:55.300 --> 04:57.812
You only slept with three dudes, right?

04:57.837 --> 04:59.833
That's what you're saying? Like, three?

04:59.858 --> 05:00.717
One less than four?

05:00.742 --> 05:01.983
That's the three we're
talking about here?

05:02.008 --> 05:03.893
Yeah, I got married
right out of college.

05:04.520 --> 05:08.619
I guess I didn't have those
years of sex-ploration.

05:08.644 --> 05:10.500
Until now.

05:10.525 --> 05:11.543
All right.

05:11.568 --> 05:13.260
Yeah. Mm.

05:13.285 --> 05:15.199
And that... that doesn't
bother you at all?

05:15.224 --> 05:16.500
Like,
you don't feel like you need to make up

05:16.525 --> 05:17.756
for lost time or anything?

05:17.781 --> 05:19.281
Well, what do you think I'm doing now?

05:19.306 --> 05:22.170
Babe, that's a lot of
responsibility for one person.

05:22.195 --> 05:23.987
Well, you know what they say:

05:24.012 --> 05:26.605
third time's a charm.

05:27.989 --> 05:29.579
Hey, wait. What's your number?

05:29.604 --> 05:30.534
What?

05:31.364 --> 05:32.320
Uh...

05:32.345 --> 05:33.598
it's, like, you know, like,

05:33.623 --> 05:34.933
a multiple of three.

05:36.116 --> 05:37.474
It's, like...

05:37.499 --> 05:38.660
What, like six?

05:38.685 --> 05:39.654
Yeah, sure.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:48.557 --> 05:50.124
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:51.879 --> 05:53.612
"The Kosher Butcher's Daughter"?

05:53.637 --> 05:55.467
Are you sleeping with her too?

05:55.491 --> 05:57.801
No, I'm making Friday
night dinner for Malkie

05:57.826 --> 05:59.134
and her friends.

05:59.160 --> 06:03.028
It's sort of a Shabbat/apology
for polluting the mikveh.

06:03.053 --> 06:04.786
Yeah, we definitely
should not have crashed

06:04.811 --> 06:06.242
an Orthodox woman's bath.

06:06.267 --> 06:09.311
That's why the brisket needs
to be really, really good.

06:09.542 --> 06:12.651
Hey, how many sexual
partners have you had?

06:12.878 --> 06:14.373
At the same time?

06:14.442 --> 06:15.497
Never mind.

06:23.431 --> 06:24.597
Oh, hey. Good morning.

06:24.622 --> 06:25.509
Good news.

06:25.534 --> 06:27.772
I just got word that
Gwyneth is in for tonight.

06:27.797 --> 06:29.465
That's great.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.990
She's gonna "goop" it and everything.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.606
- Oh.
- "Who Is Aubrey Alexis?"

06:33.631 --> 06:35.749
The question everyone is asking.

06:35.774 --> 06:37.841
"Is she an MFA student
at the New School?

06:37.866 --> 06:40.011
"A Midwestern housewife
who hides her vibrator

06:40.036 --> 06:41.368
in a Lord & Taylor bag?"

06:41.393 --> 06:44.109
Well, tonight she's going
to be Gwyneth Paltrow.

06:44.133 --> 06:46.080
She's reading for Aubrey?

06:46.105 --> 06:47.501
That's wonderful.

06:48.404 --> 06:50.740
Radha is going to be thrilled.

06:50.765 --> 06:53.309
Don't we all love just
love to thrill Radha.

06:57.997 --> 07:00.190
Do you think I made too much food?

07:00.215 --> 07:01.531
Are you kidding?

07:01.556 --> 07:02.556
These are Jewish women.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.423
They would eat Lebanon
if it would just separate

07:04.448 --> 07:05.490
from the continent.

07:05.515 --> 07:06.713
- Hello, hello.
- Hey!

07:06.738 --> 07:07.934
Wow.

07:09.752 --> 07:11.686
Hi. Oh, my God.

07:11.711 --> 07:13.077
Hi. How are you?

07:13.102 --> 07:16.587
Talia, Estie, this is my Maggie,

07:16.612 --> 07:17.999
and you've already met Sarah.

07:18.024 --> 07:19.624
Welcome. Shabbat Shalom.

07:19.649 --> 07:20.717
Both: Shabbat Shalom.

07:20.742 --> 07:22.622
Here we have sweet potato latkes

07:22.647 --> 07:24.947
and lox crostini to start.

07:24.972 --> 07:27.849
Wow. Usually someone has to
die to get food this nice.

07:28.674 --> 07:30.654
Oh, and here. Israeli wine.

07:30.679 --> 07:32.287
Uh, I shouldn't.

07:32.312 --> 07:33.854
All right. Just a teeny tiny drop.

07:33.878 --> 07:35.365
- Okay.
- It's fine, right?

07:35.390 --> 07:36.834
- Totally.
- Yeah, more than that.

07:36.859 --> 07:37.385
Yep.

07:37.410 --> 07:39.886
So how do you all know each other?

07:39.911 --> 07:43.079
Well, Sarah was formerly
engaged to my brother.

07:43.104 --> 07:46.338
And I milked Talia's honey in
the Bedouin Tents on Birthright.

07:46.363 --> 07:48.096
You could've just said that we dated.

07:48.121 --> 07:49.395
I could have.

07:49.420 --> 07:51.956
But now I'm married to Deb,
who couldn't make it.

07:51.981 --> 07:53.245
But you're gonna meet her.

07:53.270 --> 07:54.814
Maggie, you made all this?

07:54.839 --> 07:57.174
We all cheat and go to Zabar's.

07:57.199 --> 07:59.400
Some of us even go to Trader Joe's.

07:59.425 --> 08:01.546
That was during a
fricking hurricane, Sarah.

08:01.651 --> 08:03.786
Do you know how many times
I wanted to be Amy Irving

08:03.811 --> 08:04.810
in "Crossing Delancey"?

08:04.835 --> 08:06.235
Oh, I love that movie.

08:06.260 --> 08:08.017
Except for the pickle man.
Reminds me of my ex.

08:08.042 --> 08:10.389
'Cause she could only
climax from a pickle claw.

08:10.414 --> 08:14.049
Ah, well, the true test of a
sustainable relationship is

08:14.074 --> 08:15.739
"does it give me carpal tunnel?"

08:15.764 --> 08:16.906
That is a good one.

08:16.931 --> 08:18.041
That's really good.

08:21.847 --> 08:23.379
_

08:23.404 --> 08:24.260
_

08:24.285 --> 08:24.768
_

08:24.793 --> 08:25.793
_

08:27.070 --> 08:29.394
Why does each writer's nametag
feature a dirty phrase?

08:29.419 --> 08:31.748
It's their literary
erotic claim to fame.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.380
Oh. A hummer.

08:34.405 --> 08:36.123
Silver balling.

08:36.148 --> 08:37.664
You'll understand when you're older.

08:40.746 --> 08:43.727
Mm-hmm. There's Daphne Merkin.

08:43.753 --> 08:46.078
Ooh, and Eve Ensler.

08:46.102 --> 08:48.468
It's a very impressive group.

08:48.493 --> 08:49.892
I agree.

08:49.917 --> 08:51.859
What's Liza doing here?

08:52.429 --> 08:54.463
Aubrey Alexis is her author.

08:54.488 --> 08:55.234
Ooh.

08:55.259 --> 08:57.152
Well, you must tell me
who Aubrey really is.

08:57.177 --> 08:59.131
Or at least a subtle
hint in her direction.

08:59.156 --> 09:00.234
If only I could.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.598
Pam Pam!

09:02.623 --> 09:06.323
Now "Gawker" is claiming
Lena Dunham is Aubrey Alexis.

09:06.347 --> 09:09.601
We've already seen her
slippery oyster on HBO GO.

09:09.626 --> 09:12.195
Don't they know the woman
has nothing left to hide?

09:12.220 --> 09:13.652
Edward, what are you doing here?

09:13.677 --> 09:16.199
I'm not gonna miss the
inaugural public reading

09:16.224 --> 09:17.040
of my book.

09:17.065 --> 09:19.699
Oh, you mean Aubrey's book.

09:19.724 --> 09:21.838
Well, of course I do,
but that doesn't mean

09:21.863 --> 09:24.354
I'll tolerate others
stealing my thunder.

09:24.379 --> 09:26.084
Ooh, Toni Morrison.

09:26.109 --> 09:27.142
Toni!

09:27.167 --> 09:28.666
Excuse me. Hey, girl!

09:29.907 --> 09:32.358
- Excuse me for one second.
- Oh, okay.

09:32.383 --> 09:33.582
Did you know he was coming?

09:33.607 --> 09:34.807
No, I had no idea.

09:34.832 --> 09:35.667
Will this be a problem?

09:35.692 --> 09:36.724
No, I don't think so.

09:36.749 --> 09:38.170
Everyone's attention will be on Gwyneth.

09:38.195 --> 09:39.394
What are you two whispering about?

09:39.419 --> 09:41.521
- Uh, nothing.
- Nothing.

09:43.655 --> 09:46.255
Can I get a quote on tonight's event,
Ms. Peters?

09:46.280 --> 09:48.465
Sorry. Have we met?

09:48.490 --> 09:49.900
Colin McNichol.

09:49.926 --> 09:51.659
I did a piece on
"The New Yorker"'s Page-Turner blog

09:51.684 --> 09:53.084
about what makes a book millennial.

09:53.109 --> 09:54.731
Right.

09:55.232 --> 09:57.730
You said my imprint had
yet to prove itself.

09:57.755 --> 09:59.221
No, I said you had the potential

09:59.246 --> 10:00.652
to be a notable influencer.

10:00.677 --> 10:03.633
Well, then I will potentially
consider thanking you.

10:03.961 --> 10:05.251
What's your next piece on, Colin?

10:05.276 --> 10:06.865
It's a "Talk of the Town."

10:06.890 --> 10:08.378
My first in the print
magazine, actually.

10:08.403 --> 10:10.146
- That's a big step.
- It is.

10:10.171 --> 10:11.870
You could make it even bigger

10:11.896 --> 10:14.164
if you unveiled the
identity of Aubrey Alexis.

10:15.573 --> 10:19.305
Points for being so direct,
but I'm sworn to secrecy.

10:19.330 --> 10:20.682
You don't mind direct questions?

10:20.706 --> 10:21.705
I prefer them.

10:21.730 --> 10:22.602
What about secrets?

10:22.627 --> 10:24.019
It depends on what kind.

10:24.044 --> 10:25.975
Well, this club is brimming with them.

10:26.220 --> 10:28.602
If you'd like,
I could show you one of my favorites.

10:28.627 --> 10:29.953
Hmm.

10:31.270 --> 10:34.144
That was the juiciest
brisket I have ever eaten.

10:34.169 --> 10:35.182
Mm-hmm.

10:35.207 --> 10:36.825
Except for that one time in Tulum.

10:36.850 --> 10:37.621
Please don't.

10:37.646 --> 10:39.980
I'll email you the recipe.

10:40.005 --> 10:42.128
We should host every
Sapphic Shabbat here.

10:42.640 --> 10:43.239
Right?

10:43.265 --> 10:46.239
Let's make a toast to our Sabbath queen.

10:46.264 --> 10:46.926
Yes.

10:46.951 --> 10:48.076
Alll: Maggie!

10:49.179 --> 10:50.694
Oh, Maggie,

10:50.719 --> 10:53.605
you should to come to our
self-renewal retreat at Kripalu.

10:53.630 --> 10:54.535
Yes!

10:54.560 --> 10:56.248
What are you doing
for the High Holidays?

10:56.274 --> 10:58.313
We have the most amazing Cantor.

10:58.337 --> 10:59.737
She's family.

10:59.762 --> 11:01.676
Oh, and you have to sit with
us at the Rainbow Jews Gala.

11:01.701 --> 11:04.166
And don't...
don't forget my baby-naming party!

11:04.191 --> 11:05.520
Oh, you can name the baby.

11:05.545 --> 11:07.093
- Are you okay?
- Where are you going?

11:07.119 --> 11:09.259
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I just... too much Kosher wine.

11:09.283 --> 11:10.473
Excuse me.

11:27.970 --> 11:29.061
Mm.

11:29.086 --> 11:30.864
Hold on! I'm just...

11:31.305 --> 11:34.355
I feel like this little guy's
doing just donkey kicks... ugh...

11:34.380 --> 11:35.698
On my bladder.

11:35.724 --> 11:37.889
Oh, wow.

11:37.914 --> 11:41.141
This bathroom is just as funky
as the rest of your apartment.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.236
- I like your vibe, Maggie.
- Isn't it great?

11:43.276 --> 11:44.863
Hey, did you make that one, babe?

11:44.888 --> 11:47.139
- Oh, is that you?
- Uh, no, no.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.660
I got that one at a
flea market in Greece.

11:48.686 --> 11:49.935
When did you go to Greece?

11:49.960 --> 11:51.601
Why don't I tell you in the kitchen.

11:51.626 --> 11:53.100
I'm gonna go pour some more wine.

11:53.125 --> 11:55.436
- Any... anyone?
- Yes!

11:55.461 --> 11:56.464
Kidding.

12:02.989 --> 12:04.985
Where are you taking me?

12:05.010 --> 12:06.510
You'll see.

12:13.563 --> 12:15.567
Here we are.

12:16.767 --> 12:18.550
What is this place?

12:18.575 --> 12:21.549
This is where they house all
their secret archival treasures.

12:22.397 --> 12:23.729
And how do you have a key?

12:23.754 --> 12:25.428
I'm doing research for a piece.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.659
Oh.

12:26.683 --> 12:29.124
This is the last love
letter that Keats wrote

12:29.149 --> 12:31.683
to Fanny Brawne before
he died at the age of 25.

12:31.708 --> 12:33.121
Wow.

12:33.146 --> 12:35.315
"How I applied this to you, my dear;

12:35.340 --> 12:37.374
"how I palpated it...

12:37.677 --> 12:41.307
"how the certainty that you were
in the same world with myself,

12:41.332 --> 12:44.810
and though as beautiful,
not so talismanic."

12:44.835 --> 12:46.852
"Not so talismanic"?

12:46.877 --> 12:48.535
He's saying she had magical powers

12:48.560 --> 12:50.036
that turned men melancholy.

12:50.061 --> 12:51.060
Oh.

12:51.085 --> 12:53.035
- Sounds like me.
- Oh.

12:53.068 --> 12:57.326
Well, I think you turn
men far from melancholic.

13:02.177 --> 13:04.120
Oh, no. Oh, God.

13:04.145 --> 13:05.265
I... I got to go.

13:05.290 --> 13:06.710
Come and find me later.

13:08.927 --> 13:10.493
Gwyneth had a what?

13:10.518 --> 13:12.682
A vagina-steaming incident.

13:12.707 --> 13:15.639
No, I heard you.
I just wish I could un-hear it.

13:15.664 --> 13:16.820
Why would she steam it?

13:16.844 --> 13:19.388
The vagina is already self-cleaning.

13:19.492 --> 13:21.349
Is it too late to find a substitute?

13:21.374 --> 13:22.263
I'm already on it.

13:22.288 --> 13:23.319
No, no, no, no!

13:23.344 --> 13:25.105
Enough with everyone claiming credit.

13:25.130 --> 13:25.887
I want to read it.

13:25.912 --> 13:28.486
I want to come out as
the real Aubrey Alexis

13:28.511 --> 13:29.510
once and for all.

13:29.617 --> 13:30.514
Edward...

13:30.539 --> 13:32.537
Don't try and talk me
out of this, Charles.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.447
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

13:34.472 --> 13:36.660
Wait, Edward, Edward,
Edward, Edward, Edward.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.320
I understand your frustration.

13:38.345 --> 13:39.330
I really do.

13:39.355 --> 13:42.229
It's... it's difficult to keep a secret.

13:42.254 --> 13:45.522
Especially when you pretend
to be someone else in order

13:45.547 --> 13:47.638
to be taken seriously
in your profession.

13:47.663 --> 13:48.982
But your book...

13:49.391 --> 13:54.094
Your book has helped so many
young women unlock their desire

13:54.119 --> 13:58.166
and discover their bodies and
enact their sexual freedom.

13:58.191 --> 13:59.791
And what's more important?

13:59.816 --> 14:03.694
Exposing the truth or
allowing your readers

14:03.719 --> 14:07.644
to enjoy the collective fantasy
that Aubrey Alexis is the voice

14:07.669 --> 14:09.342
of women everywhere?

14:09.367 --> 14:12.605
Then you should read
it, Princess Pam Pam.

14:12.630 --> 14:13.509
Wait, what?

14:13.535 --> 14:15.469
I want you to read for Aubrey Alexis.

14:15.494 --> 14:17.371
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I... I can't.

14:17.396 --> 14:19.636
I... I'm not good at...
I don't public speaking.

14:19.661 --> 14:23.123
Either Pam Pam reads or I will.

14:29.067 --> 14:32.028
Now we will end with our newest author.

14:32.053 --> 14:37.153
Though we can't say who she is,
"Me, Myself, and O" has awakened

14:37.178 --> 14:40.218
a new generation of young women.

14:40.243 --> 14:43.044
Please welcome Gwyneth Pal...

14:43.220 --> 14:48.800
Nope, Liza Miller,
reading for the enigmatic sensation,

14:48.825 --> 14:50.792
Aubrey Alexis.

15:01.849 --> 15:04.130
"I lay on the bed quivering,

15:04.155 --> 15:08.120
"my hands lingering over my panties.

15:08.145 --> 15:12.129
"I could feel my woman pulse
throbbing through the lace.

15:12.889 --> 15:15.495
"And as I slid my fingers inside...

15:15.520 --> 15:19.905
"towards the place no man
could ever fully penetrate,

15:20.114 --> 15:23.717
I felt my flower begin to blossom"...

15:23.742 --> 15:25.118
Both: "To release."

15:25.143 --> 15:26.910
"To burst open.

15:26.935 --> 15:28.953
To explode."

15:29.248 --> 15:31.913
I am Aubrey Alexis!

15:31.938 --> 15:34.304
I am Aubrey Alexis!

15:34.340 --> 15:35.721
Yes!

15:35.746 --> 15:38.153
I am Aubrey Alexis!

15:40.562 --> 15:42.000
I am Aubrey Alexis!

15:42.025 --> 15:43.136
No.

15:43.161 --> 15:44.920
I am Aubrey Alexis.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.952
I am Aubrey Alexis!

15:46.977 --> 15:48.416
All: I am Aubrey Alexis.

15:48.441 --> 15:49.322
No!

15:49.347 --> 15:51.147
All: I am Aubrey Alexis!

15:51.172 --> 15:51.953
No!

15:51.978 --> 15:53.515
All: I am Aubrey Alexis!

15:53.540 --> 15:56.120
I am Aubrey Alexis!

16:00.473 --> 16:03.264
My friends loved you.

16:03.289 --> 16:05.791
Yeah, and I... I really liked them.

16:06.307 --> 16:07.823
But, um...

16:07.848 --> 16:10.200
you know, I just don't
think I can do this.

16:10.225 --> 16:11.552
Do what?

16:11.577 --> 16:13.760
This. Us.

16:13.785 --> 16:17.080
Them. I... I don't understand.

16:17.105 --> 16:18.334
You know, Malkie, I realized tonight

16:18.359 --> 16:19.413
that I don't know if
I'm ready for, like,

16:19.438 --> 16:21.521
a real relationship
and all it comes with.

16:21.546 --> 16:23.620
The new food, the new friends.

16:23.645 --> 16:25.078
I mean, they booked up my weekends

16:25.103 --> 16:26.394
for, like, the next three years.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.802
I know they can be a lot.

16:27.827 --> 16:29.511
No, that's the thing. It's not them.

16:29.536 --> 16:33.186
It's just that I don't
fly in a lesbian flock.

16:33.211 --> 16:34.889
I'm more of a lone owl.

16:34.946 --> 16:37.013
Well, I... I wouldn't
want you to pretend

16:37.038 --> 16:38.434
to be someone you're not.

16:40.228 --> 16:41.561
So what now?

16:41.586 --> 16:45.055
Well, we always have our tomato patch.

16:45.891 --> 16:48.064
Come here.

16:51.493 --> 16:53.224
Was it the bathroom?

16:53.306 --> 16:54.966
That didn't help.

16:55.969 --> 16:56.792
Got to be honest.

17:00.526 --> 17:03.672
Liza, thank you for stepping in

17:03.697 --> 17:05.703
and being so game tonight.

17:06.189 --> 17:09.136
If it means keeping L.L.
Moore in the Empirical family,

17:09.161 --> 17:10.194
it was worth it.

17:10.219 --> 17:12.796
We, uh, we are a family.

17:12.820 --> 17:16.751
A dysfunctional one sometimes, but...

17:16.776 --> 17:18.480
All the best families are.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.470
Oh, you two again.

17:20.906 --> 17:22.960
Hope you don't mind that
I'm taking him home.

17:22.984 --> 17:24.141
What? Me?

17:24.165 --> 17:26.265
No, no, he's yours to take.

17:26.450 --> 17:28.304
It was, uh, it was
good to see you again.

17:28.329 --> 17:30.096
Always a pleasure.

17:37.352 --> 17:39.624
Hey. Who you looking for?

17:39.649 --> 17:41.083
Well, I met someone tonight.

17:41.107 --> 17:42.919
This cute "New Yorker" writer.

17:42.945 --> 17:44.663
- They make those?
- I know.

17:44.688 --> 17:45.865
Like, a rare breed.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.296
I'm pretty sure he was flirting with me,

17:47.321 --> 17:49.295
but then he never
asked me for my number.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.983
Hm.

17:51.008 --> 17:52.080
I'm already sick of being single.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.488
It gets better.

17:53.513 --> 17:56.183
That's what they say to kids
who are severely bullied.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.601
Come on.

18:07.858 --> 18:10.268
Imagine my surprise when I opened my
"New Yorker"

18:10.293 --> 18:12.272
this morning...
A ritual I enjoy every Monday...

18:12.297 --> 18:13.603
And I saw your name.

18:13.776 --> 18:14.909
Me?

18:14.934 --> 18:16.692
Your self-obsessed millennial antics

18:16.717 --> 18:19.753
are splashed all over
my "Talk of the Town."

18:25.132 --> 18:26.464
Oh, my God. Here it is.

18:26.489 --> 18:27.552
"I am Aubrey Alexis."

18:27.577 --> 18:29.624
"In a climactic moment, Kelsey Peters,

18:29.649 --> 18:32.731
"the talismanic beauty who runs
Empirical's Millennial Press,

18:32.756 --> 18:35.734
led the 'I'm Spartacu" rallying cry."

18:35.759 --> 18:37.403
Talismanic beauty.

18:37.428 --> 18:39.274
Is this the cute "New Yorker" writer?

18:39.299 --> 18:40.413
- Yeah.
- Ooh!

18:40.438 --> 18:42.433
And he's flirting with you in
"The New Yorker"?

18:42.458 --> 18:44.877
Who needs texting when you have
"Talk of the Town"?

18:44.902 --> 18:47.067
Scroll down. I want this guy's email.

18:47.092 --> 18:48.171
Uh-huh.

18:49.448 --> 18:50.908
_

18:54.879 --> 19:00.350
_

19:05.418 --> 19:09.266
_

19:17.152 --> 19:19.196
- Hey.
- Hi, hi, hi, hi.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.034
Oh, no. Not you too.

19:24.059 --> 19:25.138
What? Oh, yeah.

19:25.163 --> 19:26.122
Yeah. I read it.

19:26.148 --> 19:27.180
It's good.

19:27.205 --> 19:29.387
It's so dirty, but...

19:30.006 --> 19:31.267
I... I liked it.

19:31.292 --> 19:32.874
Made me really think about you.

19:32.899 --> 19:34.539
- It did?
- Yeah.

19:34.564 --> 19:37.522
This woman, she had to explore the world

19:37.547 --> 19:42.557
and bang a bunch of dudes to
finally find her perfect O.

19:42.633 --> 19:45.734
See, I read it that
she had it all along.

19:45.759 --> 19:47.361
She didn't need to go anywhere.

19:47.386 --> 19:48.553
No, she did.

19:48.578 --> 19:49.985
She did.

19:50.010 --> 19:53.304
I mean, she learned orgasmic
meditation from Raul,

19:53.329 --> 19:55.779
and circular breathing
from Karim, and...

19:55.804 --> 19:57.775
Wow, you really studied that book.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.623
Yeah.

19:59.648 --> 20:02.393
I don't know.
I think experience is important.

20:03.044 --> 20:04.314
You know?

20:04.339 --> 20:09.030
I wouldn't want you to regret

20:09.055 --> 20:12.384
jumping into this relationship
too soon after your marriage.

20:12.542 --> 20:14.202
I could never regret you.

20:14.227 --> 20:17.817
Maybe you haven't experienced
enough to know that.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.541
Which is why...

20:20.900 --> 20:22.390
I got you this.

20:23.493 --> 20:25.445
- A present?
- Yes.

20:25.470 --> 20:26.797
Just open it.

20:31.865 --> 20:34.538
"Free pass for number four."

20:34.563 --> 20:36.095
You want me to sleep with someone else?

20:36.120 --> 20:37.766
No. No.

20:37.892 --> 20:39.741
I want you

20:39.766 --> 20:43.834
to have the chance to explore, you know.

20:44.163 --> 20:48.203
But it's good for one night only,

20:48.228 --> 20:50.571
and I never want to hear about it.

20:50.662 --> 20:51.619
Ever.

20:51.644 --> 20:53.523
Ever, ever.

20:54.090 --> 20:58.166
Well, I don't plan on
cashing this in anytime soon.

20:58.191 --> 20:59.619
Great.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.294
Unless...

21:01.319 --> 21:03.291
Oh. Yes?

21:03.316 --> 21:06.184
I pretend you're somebody else tonight.

21:06.209 --> 21:08.875
And who exactly would I be?

21:08.900 --> 21:12.882
Oh, let's pretend that
you're really the 40 year old

21:13.030 --> 21:14.953
and I'm really the 26 year old.

21:14.978 --> 21:18.049
Like, so some kind of,
like, older man fantasy?

21:18.074 --> 21:20.763
Oh, no. Just a little age reversal.

21:20.924 --> 21:22.483
Yeah, I think I can roll with this.

21:23.636 --> 21:25.482
I mean, I learned from the master, so...

21:26.305 --> 21:32.201
