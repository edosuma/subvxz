00:21.688 --> 00:24.456
Jennifer, this is
carrie mathison and peter quinn.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.892
They were there with sandy
when it happened.

00:29.329 --> 00:30.896
Very sorry for your loss.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.268
He told me
he'd be safe there.

00:37.637 --> 00:38.771
Not to worry.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.883
What a fucked-up situation.

00:50.885 --> 00:51.817
They have three kids.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.853
One of them's still
in elementary school.

00:54.855 --> 00:55.988
Has she told them?

00:55.990 --> 00:58.357
There are videos of him
being stomped to death

00:58.359 --> 00:59.359
All over youtube.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.193
Unless somebody needs me,

01:01.195 --> 01:02.828
I'm going to go get a drink.

01:02.830 --> 01:03.830
Fine.

01:03.831 --> 01:04.696
Get some sleep.

01:04.697 --> 01:06.331
We'll reconvene
tomorrow morning.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.599
My office.

01:10.503 --> 01:11.503
Everything okay, there?

01:11.505 --> 01:13.505
Give him some time.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.040
He was right
in the middle of it.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.042
Yeah?

01:16.043 --> 01:17.743
So were you.

01:19.245 --> 01:21.280
Tomorrow, my office, 9:00.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.368
Carrie?

02:51.938 --> 02:52.771
It's so late.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.053
I didn't want to disturb anyone.

02:54.077 --> 02:55.607
I didn't know
you were coming back.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.109
It was all really sudden.

02:57.111 --> 02:58.810
I could stay in a hotel.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.345
Hotel?!

03:00.347 --> 03:01.613
What are you talking about?

03:01.615 --> 03:03.448
Here, do you want to hold her?

03:12.659 --> 03:14.059
Aw...

03:16.129 --> 03:17.462
I heard her crying.

03:17.464 --> 03:19.131
She does that sometimes.

03:19.133 --> 03:21.833
It's all perfectly normal.

03:21.835 --> 03:26.004
Oh, my god, she has
so much hair now.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.573
Come. Come inside.

03:31.511 --> 03:33.645
Come on in.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.080
You're back.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.902
That's my pool
you're polluting.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.170
It's your pool?

03:58.172 --> 04:00.339
Mm-hmm.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.608
You don't remember me,
do you?

04:04.844 --> 04:06.545
Sure.
No, you don't.

04:06.547 --> 04:09.081
I'm the manager,
remember?

04:09.083 --> 04:13.051
We met when you paid me
six months in advance?

04:13.053 --> 04:14.753
I mean, normally,
I have to chase people

04:14.755 --> 04:18.257
Just to get their
last month's.

04:18.259 --> 04:21.059
And you really can't have
glass bottles out here.

04:21.060 --> 04:24.062
It breaks, you gotta
drain the whole pool.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.069
God...

04:31.071 --> 04:33.105
You are so drunk.

04:48.921 --> 04:50.455
My life wasn't
bad enough already,

04:50.457 --> 04:52.257
You had to make it worse.

04:52.259 --> 04:54.059
I had to show people what
the americans did.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.595
But I will be blamed
for the cia chief's death.

04:56.597 --> 04:57.896
I will be blamed
for the riots.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.598
No, you won't.
Yes, I will.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.800
It's because
it was my video,

05:01.802 --> 05:03.535
And it's my face on it.

05:05.938 --> 05:07.773
Also, people
are watching me now.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.074
No one is watching you.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.076
Who's that guy?

05:11.311 --> 05:12.744
That's a teaching fellow.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.079
You don't know that.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.248
Yeah, I do.
I had him for physiology.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.983
So did you.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.418
Salaam.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.420
See? You're safe.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.255
You need to calm down.

05:23.257 --> 05:24.923
Don't tell me that, okay?

05:24.925 --> 05:26.992
You have no idea how
this country really works.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.293
No one is safe.

05:28.295 --> 05:29.295
Aayan!

05:29.296 --> 05:31.663
You're aayan ibrahim.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.933
Aayan, those were your
relatives that were killed

05:34.935 --> 05:36.655
In the wedding party
the americans bombed...

05:36.679 --> 05:37.436
Isn't that so?

05:37.438 --> 05:38.837
Yes. Yes.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.999
And the cia chief who ordered
that bombing is now dead.

05:41.023 --> 05:43.290
Does that feel
like justice?

05:46.646 --> 05:47.879
It doesn't?

05:49.115 --> 05:52.517
Aayan, people want
to know what you think.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.852
The americans,
they're murderers, okay?

05:53.854 --> 05:56.014
But what we did to that man,
how is that any different?

05:56.016 --> 05:57.683
They say it stopped
the drone strikes.

05:57.685 --> 05:59.458
Is that not a good thing?

05:59.460 --> 06:00.959
My family has just been killed!

06:00.961 --> 06:02.241
Now, please,
just leave me alone!

06:02.265 --> 06:03.698
Aayan...!

07:24.111 --> 07:27.746
Look, we don't
have to, um...

07:27.748 --> 07:29.781
I mean, you don't need to...

07:35.788 --> 07:37.989
Want to get some breakfast?

07:46.567 --> 07:47.466
Here.
Morning.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.067
Take her.
No, I can't.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.769
What do you mean, you can't?
Take her.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.137
No, really, I can't.
I gotta go.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.139
Keep her head up.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.440
Carrie, you...

07:55.442 --> 07:57.275
Yeah, fine.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.376
Just keep her head up.

07:59.612 --> 08:01.146
Got it?

08:02.582 --> 08:04.583
So, um...

08:04.585 --> 08:06.084
This mean
that you're back?

08:06.086 --> 08:08.453
Uh, just for
a couple of days.

08:08.455 --> 08:10.789
Couple?

08:10.791 --> 08:13.425
I wasn't planning
to be here at all.

08:13.427 --> 08:14.926
So what about franny?

08:14.928 --> 08:17.662
Uh, I...

08:17.664 --> 08:19.164
I think she's done.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.168
You know that's
not what I meant.

08:24.804 --> 08:26.972
It can't come as a surprise
to you that, uh,

08:26.974 --> 08:28.934
Dad isn't pitching in
as much as he said he would.

08:28.958 --> 08:30.275
Well, what about the nanny?

08:30.277 --> 08:31.977
She's great, when she's here.

08:31.979 --> 08:32.979
But, uh...

08:34.615 --> 08:36.780
We really need
to talk.

08:37.784 --> 08:38.984
I know. I know.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.150
But I'm... I'm already late.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.986
Good morning!
Seriously...

08:41.989 --> 08:43.522
We have a lot to talk about.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.524
Tonight?

08:45.526 --> 08:47.292
Okay. Tonight.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.294
Okay.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.195
Bye.
Bye.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.330
Hi! Hi...

08:52.332 --> 08:54.633
The americans,
they're murderers, okay?

08:54.635 --> 08:56.835
But what we did to that man,
how is that any different?

08:56.837 --> 08:58.597
They say it
stopped the drone strikes.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.971
Is that not a good thing?

09:02.175 --> 09:03.308
Sorry I'm late.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.810
Quinn's not even
in the building yet.

09:05.812 --> 09:09.014
A few months overseas and
you're both on third world time.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.515
You see this?
No.

09:10.517 --> 09:11.983
Kid who shot
the wedding video,

09:11.985 --> 09:14.486
Turns out he's a nephew
of haissam haqqani.

09:14.488 --> 09:15.353
Where'd they find him?

09:15.355 --> 09:17.355
Some medical school
in islamabad.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.690
He's a student there.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.492
And he's not a foaming-
at-the-mouth jihadist.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.616
He's reasonable.
Can you believe it?

09:23.663 --> 09:25.196
Sir, this mess in islamabad,

09:25.198 --> 09:26.565
It's not just going away.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.366
Oh, you think?

09:28.368 --> 09:30.368
We need a new chief there.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.703
I'd like it to be me.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.872
You would?
Kabul is fine.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.206
My deputy can run that station.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.542
But we've got one of our own
dead in islamabad

09:37.544 --> 09:39.044
And I need to find out
what happened.

09:39.046 --> 09:42.380
You dropped a bomb on
a goddamn wedding,

09:42.382 --> 09:44.382
Is what happened!

09:44.384 --> 09:45.884
I'm under attack here.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.752
You get that, right?

09:47.754 --> 09:49.187
The state department
never liked

09:49.189 --> 09:50.669
What we're doing
in the border region.

09:50.693 --> 09:53.191
They're using this to
try and shut us down.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.426
We've got a hearing coming up

09:54.428 --> 09:56.361
In the senate
intelligence committee.

09:56.363 --> 09:59.364
I need you here...
Convincing the committee

09:59.366 --> 10:02.367
That what the state department
wants is bad for america,

10:02.369 --> 10:04.402
And that a fuckup
of this magnitude

10:04.404 --> 10:06.404
Could never, ever
happen again.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.539
You think you could do that?

10:07.541 --> 10:09.140
Sure.
Good!

10:14.748 --> 10:16.548
And-and then what?

10:16.550 --> 10:17.550
What do you mean?

10:17.551 --> 10:19.217
Well, how long am I back for?

10:19.219 --> 10:21.386
How long...? Permanently!

10:21.388 --> 10:24.556
And just so we're clear,
the word is accountability.

10:24.558 --> 10:26.157
You're being recalled.

10:27.727 --> 10:28.960
Look at it this way:

10:28.962 --> 10:32.364
You'll get to spend time
with your kid.

10:45.578 --> 10:48.113
They're called dip 'ems.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.415
One of the major food groups
where I grew up,

10:50.417 --> 10:51.916
And I got addicted.

10:51.918 --> 10:54.319
I know,
you're all shocked.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.763
You don't say much, do you?

11:04.765 --> 11:06.998
I'd rather listen to you.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.100
You got some charm
working there.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.536
I'm sure I'm not the
first to say that.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.445
Um...

11:20.447 --> 11:22.480
Last night...

11:22.482 --> 11:24.616
Uh, you...

11:24.618 --> 11:26.785
Were... Moaning.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.220
Not during, but, um...

11:30.289 --> 11:32.323
After,
while you were sleeping.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.659
I'm sorry.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.895
Are you okay?

11:37.663 --> 11:39.230
Yeah.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.599
Really?

11:47.841 --> 11:49.841
Honestly, it's...

11:49.843 --> 11:52.977
Been kind of a rough week.

11:52.979 --> 11:55.613
It's been a very rough week.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.818
Do you want to tell me about it?

11:59.820 --> 12:01.152
I do.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.520
But I can't.

12:02.522 --> 12:03.655
Yeah, like shamu.

12:09.361 --> 12:11.229
Well, if you change your mind,
you will find

12:11.231 --> 12:13.631
That I am a very good listener.

12:15.534 --> 12:17.035
You need anything?

12:17.037 --> 12:19.537
No, I'm good.

12:24.711 --> 12:27.579
Jesus christ.

12:33.552 --> 12:35.019
Something funny?

12:35.021 --> 12:36.855
Oh, uh,

12:36.857 --> 12:38.089
Nothing.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.291
No, it's okay, I speak dumbass.
What is it?

12:43.863 --> 12:45.230
What, suddenly nothing?

12:45.232 --> 12:46.531
Nothing's amusing?

12:46.533 --> 12:47.565
Peter,

12:47.567 --> 12:49.367
Forget it; it-it's okay.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.869
Believe me,
I hear it all the time.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.004
Come on. Please.

12:53.873 --> 12:55.940
Well, since you asked,

12:55.942 --> 12:59.077
What I said was,
"when she gets on a scale,

12:59.079 --> 13:01.913
It says,
'one at a time, please.'"

13:05.719 --> 13:08.286
What an asshole. Douche.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.119
Do you want to...

13:41.121 --> 13:42.287
Oh, no, thanks.

13:42.289 --> 13:43.922
I'll-I'll learn from the pro.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.657
Okay.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.926
Yeah.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.994
Yes, yes.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.667
Yeah.

14:03.442 --> 14:05.977
Yeah?

14:05.979 --> 14:08.079
Are-are you all right?

14:09.281 --> 14:11.416
Yeah, I-I'm on my way.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.052
Sorry.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.832
They're letting you go.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.300
No charges?

14:29.302 --> 14:31.135
A fine.
Plus you'll have to deal

14:31.137 --> 14:32.617
With that guy you put
in the hospital.

14:32.641 --> 14:34.339
I guess he's all cut up.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.875
They were pretty pissed,
the cops were.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.143
I had to play the ptsd card.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.013
So what happened?

14:42.015 --> 14:44.048
Nothing. It was stupid.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.817
Are you okay?

14:45.819 --> 14:48.052
I thought I was until I found
myself beating the shit

14:48.054 --> 14:49.854
Out of some idiot for no reason.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.656
Almost no reason.

14:51.658 --> 14:54.259
And now I just want
to get out of here!

14:56.663 --> 14:59.831
You missed the meeting
with lockhart this morning.

14:59.833 --> 15:01.199
Oh, fuck.
Don't worry.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.034
He had other things
on his mind.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.836
He's making me stay here.

15:04.838 --> 15:05.870
For the hearings?

15:05.872 --> 15:07.171
Permanently.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.007
He called it accountability.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.509
Meaning for someone besides him.

15:11.511 --> 15:14.045
This thing was fucked
from the start,

15:14.047 --> 15:16.014
And the one person
who can actually say why

15:16.016 --> 15:17.682
Is being buried tomorrow.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.551
I should be in islamabad,
figuring out how this happened,

15:20.553 --> 15:22.887
Not holding lockhart's hand
at some senate hearing.

15:22.889 --> 15:25.329
I don't know, maybe it's good
to get out of there for a while.

15:25.353 --> 15:27.887
Yeah, it's working wonders
for you.

15:31.230 --> 15:33.731
You know there was that
case officer you told me about,

15:33.733 --> 15:35.366
The one who was fired
in islamabad

15:35.368 --> 15:36.534
About the same time
you got there.

15:36.536 --> 15:37.736
You were gonna check into him.

15:37.738 --> 15:39.138
Jordan harris,
only he wasn't fired.

15:39.140 --> 15:41.240
They shipped him home
and stuck him in archives.

15:41.242 --> 15:43.341
Pretty much the same thing.

15:44.209 --> 15:45.743
Quinn!

15:45.745 --> 15:47.879
You're released.

15:51.383 --> 15:53.251
Well, what do you say,
you want to come along?

15:53.253 --> 15:54.752
Pay harris a visit?

15:54.754 --> 15:56.421
Not really.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.890
Why, you got more brawling
to do?

15:58.892 --> 16:00.892
Maybe.

16:00.894 --> 16:02.226
Who knows?

16:02.228 --> 16:04.128
Well, if you do,

16:04.130 --> 16:06.464
Feel free to call me again.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.866
Honestly, this kind of
brightened my day.

17:21.006 --> 17:22.839
Aayan?
<i>Assalamu aleikum.</i>

17:22.842 --> 17:24.575
<i>Waleikum salam.</i>

17:33.318 --> 17:34.919
Omar.

17:38.524 --> 17:39.590
Papa.

18:15.094 --> 18:19.030
Rahim ruined my life
by putting that video online.

18:19.032 --> 18:20.898
Your life's not ruined.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.701
Yeah, it is.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.704
What's left of it, anyway.

18:26.706 --> 18:30.408
You know,
people look at me now.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.077
They're watching me.

18:33.079 --> 18:34.912
No. You imagine it.

18:34.914 --> 18:38.916
Ever since that reporter
put me on tv.

18:38.918 --> 18:41.752
Listen, I need a favor.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.087
I need to put this

18:43.089 --> 18:44.388
Someplace safe for a while.

18:44.390 --> 18:45.423
Yeah, what is it?

18:45.425 --> 18:46.557
Just, um,

18:46.559 --> 18:49.427
Personal things
that I don't want taken.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.462
Hmm? I'll pick it up soon.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.332
Not more than ten days.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.469
When will I see you?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.438
Tomorrow at school.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.941
No, I mean...

19:03.943 --> 19:05.843
<i>See you.</i>

19:08.080 --> 19:09.447
I don't know.

19:09.449 --> 19:12.416
Everything is just
really complicated right now.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.018
And I just...

19:34.973 --> 19:36.307
Mr. Harris?

19:36.309 --> 19:37.808
Yeah?

19:37.810 --> 19:41.012
Carrie mathison.

19:42.114 --> 19:43.948
I guess you didn't get
my message.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.450
I guess you didn't get mine.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.486
I just need a couple
minutes of your time.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.820
I have a few questions

19:49.822 --> 19:51.489
About islamabad.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.658
I didn't know anything
about it.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.359
You were a case officer there.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.494
What I mean is,

19:56.496 --> 19:58.496
I don't want to talk about it

19:58.498 --> 20:01.432
With you or anyone else.

20:02.501 --> 20:04.969
Look, mr. Harris, two days ago,

20:04.971 --> 20:06.837
Sandy bachman was killed
in the streets.

20:06.839 --> 20:07.972
Yeah, I heard.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.874
I want to know
how it happened.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.209
You were there, right?

20:11.211 --> 20:13.010
Yes.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.479
So why are you asking me?

20:15.481 --> 20:19.016
Look, I've already found out
certain things about him.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.818
That he kept to himself,

20:20.820 --> 20:21.900
That whatever he was doing,

20:21.924 --> 20:23.654
Whoever he was talking to
on the outside,

20:23.656 --> 20:25.189
No one in the station knew.

20:25.191 --> 20:26.390
He left everyone in the dark.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.593
Okay.

20:29.528 --> 20:30.661
So what was going on?

20:30.663 --> 20:32.063
You were a case officer there.

20:32.065 --> 20:35.499
Yeah, and now I fill freedom
of information requests

20:35.501 --> 20:37.401
From conspiracy nuts in ohio.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.569
Are we done?

20:38.571 --> 20:41.539
Listen, anything...
No, you listen.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.074
Do I want to speak with you?

20:43.076 --> 20:44.408
Was it somehow unclear?

20:44.410 --> 20:46.177
What did I say?

20:46.179 --> 20:48.112
What did I say?

21:04.597 --> 21:06.697
Shh.

21:06.699 --> 21:09.267
Where have you been?

21:09.269 --> 21:10.868
Sorry.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.571
I got a panicked phone call
from the nanny at 5:30.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.606
She had to leave to pick up
her own kids.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.074
You were nowhere to be found.

21:17.076 --> 21:18.576
I didn't know.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.211
You didn't ask.

21:20.213 --> 21:21.379
You said you'd be back here

21:21.381 --> 21:22.661
After your meeting
with lockhart.

21:22.685 --> 21:24.615
We were all counting on you.
For the record,

21:24.617 --> 21:26.817
I had two patients
I needed to cancel.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.188
I said I'm sorry.

21:32.724 --> 21:34.292
I have my own career.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.260
I have patients who rely on me.

21:36.262 --> 21:38.629
And-and my kids, my husband.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.931
I know.
Who I barely talk to,

21:40.933 --> 21:42.967
By the way.

21:46.472 --> 21:49.106
This is not what we agreed.

21:49.108 --> 21:52.410
You were going to take her
with you to istanbul.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.612
We were backup, fine.

21:54.614 --> 21:56.414
Then all the sudden,
you're off to a war zone,

21:56.416 --> 21:58.583
So she can't come with you,
and I-I'm just saying...

21:58.585 --> 22:00.584
What?

22:00.586 --> 22:02.119
You bring a life
into this world,

22:02.121 --> 22:03.854
You take responsibility.

22:08.293 --> 22:09.460
Did you hear me?

22:09.462 --> 22:10.828
Yeah, I heard you.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.600
And I'm here now permanently.

22:16.602 --> 22:18.135
Okay?

22:18.137 --> 22:20.304
Lockhart just told me.

22:20.306 --> 22:22.606
So if this is it, the big talk
that we have to have,

22:22.608 --> 22:24.442
We don't have to.

22:24.444 --> 22:27.845
You know, you don't have to...
Worry about her anymore.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.514
That's not fair.

22:35.287 --> 22:36.654
I can have her all day tomorrow.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.022
There's nothing going on, so...

22:40.125 --> 22:41.492
Look, it's 5:00 a.M. My time.

22:41.494 --> 22:42.860
I've really got to get
some sleep.

22:50.302 --> 22:52.102
Backpacks on your
back, please, girls.

22:52.126 --> 22:53.037
Come on,
let's move it.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.472
In the kitchen.
Let's go, girls.

22:54.474 --> 22:55.873
Oh, come on...
We have to move it.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.141
I know, it's late.

22:57.143 --> 22:57.975
Let's go.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.977
Get your lunches.
Here's one.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.545
Where's my lunch?

23:01.547 --> 23:02.713
In the fridge.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.548
Look in the
fridge, sweetie.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.184
All right,
there's your lunch.

23:07.186 --> 23:08.052
Let's go.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.687
Say good-bye to
franny, please.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.989
Bye, stinky.
You have to change her diaper.

23:11.991 --> 23:13.858
It smells in there.
Bye.

23:13.860 --> 23:14.860
Bye.

23:16.863 --> 23:18.529
You gonna be okay?

23:18.531 --> 23:21.532
Yeah, of course.

23:21.534 --> 23:22.974
You can call me
if you need anything.

23:22.998 --> 23:25.198
We'll be fine.

24:22.727 --> 24:26.230
Shit.

25:18.650 --> 25:22.019
That's where your dad lived
when I first met him.

25:23.822 --> 25:26.023
In that house right there.

25:49.481 --> 25:50.714
See?

25:50.716 --> 25:53.450
That's where they all lived.

25:57.689 --> 25:59.890
I was arrested on that lawn.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.167
He would've been
a terrible father.

26:10.169 --> 26:12.736
I mean, you think
I'm a terrible mom?

26:12.738 --> 26:14.672
I am, but...

26:16.175 --> 26:18.409
He would've been even worse.

26:20.378 --> 26:24.548
He was happy to hear that you
were on the way, though.

26:24.550 --> 26:27.918
He was.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.421
I think it was the last thing
he was happy about.

26:38.763 --> 26:42.232
And I...

26:42.234 --> 26:45.202
I tried...

26:45.204 --> 26:47.504
To hold on to that
and feel it, too.

26:49.541 --> 26:51.508
Happy that you're here.

26:57.782 --> 27:00.551
But...

27:00.553 --> 27:03.587
With his being gone,
I can't remember why I had you.

27:08.426 --> 27:10.461
I loved him so much.

27:16.401 --> 27:20.004
When I close my eyes,
I still see him there.

28:08.853 --> 28:11.055
Oh.

29:07.045 --> 29:09.546
You talk to carrie?

29:09.548 --> 29:10.581
Not yet.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.516
So she didn't call
you when she landed?

29:12.518 --> 29:16.687
She hasn't called me
since she went overseas.

29:16.689 --> 29:18.722
What can I say?

29:18.724 --> 29:21.358
They grow up.
They fly away.

29:21.360 --> 29:24.561
Well, I hear lockhart's
bringing her back.

29:24.563 --> 29:25.362
For the hearings?

29:25.364 --> 29:27.898
Not just.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.700
She's being recalled.

29:31.771 --> 29:33.604
You know why
he's doing it, right?

29:33.606 --> 29:37.241
Everyone knows; the
guy's transparent.

29:37.243 --> 29:40.744
Seriously...
Sum total of his thinking

29:40.746 --> 29:42.045
On intelligence policy is

29:42.047 --> 29:43.747
"what's good
for andrew lockhart?"

29:43.749 --> 29:45.115
Mm-hmm, yeah.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.684
And that, my friend,
may be good for you.

29:49.721 --> 29:51.255
Even before islamabad,

29:51.257 --> 29:54.591
There was some concern
about his abilities.

29:54.593 --> 29:55.926
Like what?

29:55.928 --> 29:58.729
This and that.
I heard rumblings.

29:58.731 --> 30:01.398
From whom?

30:01.400 --> 30:03.267
Crocker?
It doesn't matter.

30:03.269 --> 30:05.102
The point is, with
this latest fiasco,

30:05.104 --> 30:08.138
There's blood in the
water; he's vulnerable.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.774
It's not just the
dead station chief.

30:10.776 --> 30:13.277
It's the drone strikes
in the border region.

30:13.279 --> 30:16.513
His entire program
is under review.

30:19.584 --> 30:23.287
The secretary of state could
be your friend on this,

30:23.289 --> 30:25.489
If you want to
stage a comeback.

30:25.491 --> 30:29.259
So it was crocker.

30:29.261 --> 30:32.629
Well, what do
you think?

30:32.631 --> 30:35.933
There's a question
no one asks me anymore.

30:35.935 --> 30:38.769
So?

30:38.771 --> 30:42.139
Officially?

30:42.141 --> 30:45.242
Very happy
in the private sector.

30:54.652 --> 30:56.854
Look, mr. Harris,
I just need a second.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.455
I told you
to stay away from me.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.190
Not until we talk
about islamabad.

31:00.192 --> 31:03.160
You really are bat-shit crazy,
you know that?

31:03.162 --> 31:05.329
Just like they say.

31:05.331 --> 31:06.797
Is that your kid?

31:06.799 --> 31:08.031
You brought your kid here?

31:09.134 --> 31:10.801
Very nice.

31:10.803 --> 31:12.803
Very professional.

31:15.708 --> 31:18.108
Why were you recalled
from islamabad?
You want to get out now,

31:18.110 --> 31:20.350
Or you want to drive off with me
and leave the baby here?

31:20.374 --> 31:21.812
Please. I just want to talk.

31:21.814 --> 31:22.814
Fine.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.149
Get the fuck out!

31:26.151 --> 31:27.818
What, you think you know me?

31:27.820 --> 31:29.019
Well, I know you, too.

31:29.021 --> 31:30.053
You don't know shit!

31:30.055 --> 31:31.989
I know your performance
was exemplary

31:31.991 --> 31:33.056
Before you were sidelined.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.993
I know you were doing
everything right.

31:35.995 --> 31:37.875
And since I'm guessing
you didn't suddenly start

31:37.899 --> 31:41.531
I think what happened is
that you were silenced,

31:41.533 --> 31:43.166
You were thrown
in the basement.

31:43.168 --> 31:44.168
Am I right?

31:46.372 --> 31:48.205
Why are you doing this?

31:48.207 --> 31:51.208
I need to know.
I'm going back there.

31:51.210 --> 31:54.077
I heard you're
staying here.

31:54.079 --> 31:57.214
I can't stay here.

31:57.216 --> 31:59.583
I can't.

31:59.585 --> 32:02.219
So I need to know
what was going on there.

32:02.221 --> 32:04.421
You tell me,
and I'll do everything I can

32:04.423 --> 32:06.823
To get you back
in the field.

32:09.694 --> 32:13.096
We're on the same side,
you and I.

32:13.098 --> 32:16.300
The same guy who fired you
nearly got me killed.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.704
No, sandy didn't throw me out;
it was lockhart.

32:20.706 --> 32:24.241
I flew all the
way back here

32:24.243 --> 32:26.109
From islamabad to report
an intelligence leak,

32:26.111 --> 32:27.277
Next thing I know,

32:27.279 --> 32:28.378
I'm finished.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.047
Literally in the
fucking basement.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.748
Tell me about the leak.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.158
Hello?

32:56.741 --> 33:00.143
So, how was your day?

33:00.145 --> 33:01.145
Good.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.746
Good. I had
a good day.

33:02.748 --> 33:05.182
The two of you?

33:07.418 --> 33:10.120
So what'd you do?

33:10.122 --> 33:11.788
Not much.

33:11.790 --> 33:13.256
Nothing really.

33:13.258 --> 33:14.458
I know what you mean.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.293
It's not exactly
nonstop excitement.

33:16.295 --> 33:18.462
Believe me, I know.

33:18.464 --> 33:21.298
But it's important.

33:21.300 --> 33:25.335
It's really actually important.

33:29.340 --> 33:32.943
So, um... She's fed?

33:32.945 --> 33:34.644
Yeah.

33:34.646 --> 33:36.646
Changed?

33:36.648 --> 33:37.948
Yeah.

33:37.950 --> 33:41.151
Bath?

33:41.153 --> 33:43.353
Done.

33:45.623 --> 33:48.492
Hi. Hi.

33:50.496 --> 33:52.729
Carrie.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.634
You've still got the beard.

33:57.636 --> 34:00.337
Quinn told me
you shaved it off.

34:00.339 --> 34:03.006
Turned out to be
one change too many.

34:03.008 --> 34:04.808
Didn't last.

34:04.810 --> 34:07.144
Good.

34:07.146 --> 34:08.344
Did you know him?

34:08.347 --> 34:09.478
Not that well.

34:09.481 --> 34:12.315
It was my company's
idea I show up here.

34:12.317 --> 34:13.483
They pretty
much insisted.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.819
Well, I'm glad they did.

34:15.821 --> 34:17.888
We might have
something to talk about.

34:19.357 --> 34:21.358
I heard he's
bringing you back.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.827
We'll see.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.395
Save me a seat in there.

34:36.706 --> 34:38.007
Carrie, you know
general scott?

34:38.010 --> 34:40.010
Yes. Hi.
Good to see you again.

34:40.012 --> 34:43.346
I hear you were right there
when it happened.

34:43.348 --> 34:44.981
Two of us were, yeah.

34:46.516 --> 34:49.052
Excuse me,
but may I borrow him a second?

34:49.054 --> 34:50.420
Sure.
Thanks.

34:52.223 --> 34:54.024
This can't wait?

34:54.025 --> 34:55.025
No.

34:55.027 --> 34:57.194
A colleague of yours

34:57.196 --> 34:58.528
Is about to be interred.

34:58.530 --> 35:01.031
Yeah, well, I found out some
interesting facts about that.

35:01.033 --> 35:02.866
Your man in islamabad.

35:02.868 --> 35:05.735
He had a rep of not exactly
being a team player.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.404
Him, you...

35:07.406 --> 35:08.872
Half the people here.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.907
The whole agency's
full of prima donnas.

35:10.909 --> 35:13.410
Yeah, well, he had
a particular reason.

35:13.412 --> 35:16.213
Sandy had a dark asset

35:16.215 --> 35:17.714
Providing targeting
information

35:17.716 --> 35:19.749
On terrorists in
the border region.

35:19.751 --> 35:22.719
Until the wedding party, it
was, it was good information.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.921
It was genius
information, in fact.

35:24.923 --> 35:27.591
On people we'd been unable
to locate for years.

35:27.593 --> 35:29.033
Now suddenly they
were in our sights,

35:29.057 --> 35:31.428
And we were taking them
out one after the next.

35:31.430 --> 35:32.896
It was getting him
a lot of praise.

35:32.898 --> 35:36.633
It was getting you
a lot of praise, too.

35:38.269 --> 35:40.303
Which is why you
didn't want to hear

35:40.305 --> 35:42.906
How your golden
boy was doing it.

35:42.908 --> 35:45.442
That he was out there
trading top secret

35:45.444 --> 35:48.778
Information to god knows who!
Oh, please!

35:48.780 --> 35:51.615
In exchange for a few
successful drone strikes.

35:51.617 --> 35:53.483
I know who you've
been talking to.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.118
Harris.
Right.

35:55.120 --> 35:57.654
Harris flew all the way
back from islamabad

35:57.656 --> 35:59.923
To tell you in person
what was happening.

35:59.925 --> 36:01.925
You knew what was
going on there.

36:01.927 --> 36:04.094
That makes you complicit.
In what?

36:04.096 --> 36:06.129
It's called treason.

36:06.131 --> 36:09.299
There are laws against it,
and they apply to everyone.

36:09.301 --> 36:10.667
Even the director of the cia.

36:10.669 --> 36:11.501
Get a grip.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.103
I'm not complicit in anything.

36:13.105 --> 36:15.438
We're talking
about a judgment call.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.640
A judgment call

36:16.642 --> 36:19.709
That got a wedding blown up,
a station chief killed.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.648
Those hearings that
you're worried about,

36:24.650 --> 36:26.850
They're not gonna go better
in light of these facts.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.787
What do you want?

36:30.789 --> 36:32.489
What I said before.
I want islamabad.

36:32.491 --> 36:33.491
It's impossible.

36:33.492 --> 36:34.791
I already told the president

36:34.793 --> 36:36.293
You're coming back to langley.

36:36.295 --> 36:39.596
You need to listen to me.
I am not staying here.

36:43.167 --> 36:46.136
Pakistan? Why do you even want
to go back to that shithole?

36:46.138 --> 36:48.438
Yes or no?

36:50.975 --> 36:54.110
It's not even a real country.
It's a fucking acronym!

37:11.662 --> 37:14.331
So, what was that about
with lockhart?

37:14.333 --> 37:16.066
My next posting.

37:16.068 --> 37:17.534
Not here?

37:17.536 --> 37:20.170
He changed his mind.

37:20.172 --> 37:22.872
I'm going back to islamabad.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.908
As station chief.

37:27.878 --> 37:30.046
He doesn't seem too happy

37:30.048 --> 37:32.048
About it.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.417
Is it that obvious?

37:34.419 --> 37:38.154
It's a funeral,
people get upset.

37:41.359 --> 37:43.560
Your company provides
security, right?

37:43.562 --> 37:45.729
"total security solutions."

37:45.731 --> 37:49.366
I believe that's on the card.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.868
We got a meltdown over there.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.870
A dysfunctional station
plus a security team

37:53.872 --> 37:55.872
Unwilling to do their job.

37:55.874 --> 37:57.574
I'm gonna need you
to send some guys over

37:57.576 --> 37:59.376
To make sure
it doesn't happen again.

37:59.378 --> 38:01.177
All rise, please.

38:04.248 --> 38:05.448
"because god...

38:05.450 --> 38:07.050
You're sure this
is what you want?

38:07.052 --> 38:09.386
Yeah, definitely.

38:09.388 --> 38:10.754
"...This body to the earth

38:10.756 --> 38:12.055
"for we are dust...
Okay, then.

38:12.057 --> 38:15.125
"and to dust shall we return.
Anything you need.

38:15.127 --> 38:17.460
"the lord jesus will change
our mortal bodies

38:17.462 --> 38:20.764
"to be like his in glory
for he is risen.

38:20.766 --> 38:23.500
The first born of the dead."

38:31.108 --> 38:33.777
Could've been us.

38:33.779 --> 38:35.312
I'm glad it wasn't.

38:35.314 --> 38:37.914
Yeah.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.250
Me, too.

38:40.252 --> 38:41.618
I didn't see you here.

38:41.620 --> 38:44.087
I thought...
What? Another call from lockup?

38:44.089 --> 38:46.856
At this point,
nothing surprises me.

38:49.960 --> 38:53.496
That name you gave me...
it panned out.

38:53.498 --> 38:55.699
Good.
In a big way.

38:58.602 --> 39:01.271
Sandy was running an asset
that he kept secret.

39:01.273 --> 39:04.107
That's where the targeting
information came from.

39:04.109 --> 39:05.608
Which we knew,
more or less.

39:05.610 --> 39:07.010
Yeah, but here's the deal.

39:07.012 --> 39:08.945
It looks like it was
a two-way street.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.613
He was trading information
back and forth.

39:10.615 --> 39:11.981
And whoever he was
doing that with

39:11.983 --> 39:13.817
Has obviously turned against us.

39:13.819 --> 39:17.187
We need to find out who that is
and the extent of the damage.

39:20.524 --> 39:22.459
Did you hear me?

39:22.461 --> 39:24.561
Yeah.

39:27.331 --> 39:28.798
Lockhart just
gave me islamabad.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.834
We need to get back there
and get on it.

39:30.836 --> 39:32.135
I'm not going back.

39:32.137 --> 39:33.670
What do you mean?
Of course you are.

39:33.672 --> 39:34.704
No, I'm not.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.639
Not for a while at least.

39:36.641 --> 39:37.974
But I need you now.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.743
I can't. I'm sorry.

39:43.848 --> 39:46.649
Look, I know you were upset by
what happened out on the street.

39:46.651 --> 39:48.685
And if it wasn't obvious,
so was I.

39:48.687 --> 39:50.653
Maybe it didn't seem
like it at the time...

39:50.655 --> 39:53.223
Carrie...
But I was.

39:54.692 --> 39:56.493
You don't know
what I just went through

39:56.495 --> 39:57.735
With lockhart to sort this out.

39:57.759 --> 40:00.330
How can you do this to me?

40:00.332 --> 40:02.298
Carrie, here's the thing.

40:04.702 --> 40:06.936
It's not about you.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.357
<i>So, you lasted... what?</i>

40:27.359 --> 40:29.392
One day with her?
A half a day?

40:29.394 --> 40:30.593
I told you.

40:30.595 --> 40:33.029
You told me lockhart
was keeping you here.

40:33.031 --> 40:34.731
It changed.

40:34.733 --> 40:37.033
You're her mother.

40:37.035 --> 40:38.735
Wh-which is not
a choice that she made.

40:38.737 --> 40:39.936
It's a choice that you made.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.237
You don't think
that I know that?

40:41.239 --> 40:43.373
I swear to god,
I don't know what you know!

40:43.375 --> 40:46.609
Or-or don't know or what
you're thinking or anything!

40:46.611 --> 40:48.611
Look, I know it's
not fair to you.

40:48.613 --> 40:50.079
To me?

40:50.081 --> 40:51.214
What about her?

40:51.216 --> 40:52.949
See, that is where
you're wrong!

40:52.951 --> 40:55.084
She's better off with you.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.086
No one's perfect
at this, carrie.

40:57.088 --> 40:59.255
Perfect mom
is not the standard.

40:59.257 --> 41:00.623
You-you show up.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.425
That's what you do.

41:02.427 --> 41:03.726
Look, she's little right now.

41:03.728 --> 41:05.562
Anyone with a bottle
can make her happy.

41:05.564 --> 41:07.564
But in a few months,
she's gonna need

41:07.566 --> 41:09.566
Her mother
to be there for her.

41:09.568 --> 41:11.568
I can't.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.236
Yes, you can.

41:13.238 --> 41:15.271
I told you they're
sending me back!

41:15.273 --> 41:17.407
I don't have a choice!

41:17.409 --> 41:20.109
I don't believe you.

41:22.147 --> 41:23.813
I know you.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.782
I know you manipulated
this somehow.

41:25.784 --> 41:27.250
And I know now

41:27.252 --> 41:29.919
What these war zone postings
are all about.

41:29.921 --> 41:32.856
Making sure there is no place
for your daughter there.

41:34.625 --> 41:37.193
That's not true.

41:38.462 --> 41:41.164
We both know it is.

41:50.841 --> 41:53.042
When are you leaving?

41:57.147 --> 41:59.182
Now.

42:01.018 --> 42:04.053
There's not even a diagnosis
for what's wrong with you.

42:08.792 --> 42:11.194
You need to say good-bye
to her before you leave.

42:11.196 --> 42:13.730
At least have
that much courage.

43:06.383 --> 43:09.085
I'm so sorry.

45:16.847 --> 45:19.082
Hmm?

45:59.524 --> 46:01.858
You need anything
back there, ms. Mathison?

46:01.860 --> 46:03.693
I'm fine.

46:13.570 --> 46:15.705
I'm fine.
