This may be Hackney, but this is a crime
birthed in Whitechapel.

in Whitechapel.

- Am I clear?
- Yes, Mr Dove.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.709
Now that they've got the boy,
they must make their escape

03:21.840 --> 03:24.195
and must show themselves in so doing.

have all the men you require.

- Yes, sir.

Now that Mr Shine's last actions
have delivered him into your custody,

- does he speak?
- He does not.

And never mind what Mr Shine did to him.
It's...

03:51.040 --> 03:54.476
it's as if the marrow has been
sucked from his bones.

It is perhaps understandable.

You have cleared the Leman Street cells
for his safety there?

04:03.880 --> 04:04.790
I have.

Isaac Bloom.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.429
You recall the name?

10:52.400 --> 10:53.435
Isaac was a mathematician.

10:53.560 --> 10:57.190
He believed that numbers betrayed
the true nature of our universe

10:57.320 --> 10:59.231
and that, accordingly,
it was empirically proved

10:59.360 --> 11:03.558
that the entropy of the universe extended
to a maximum,

11:03.680 --> 11:08.117
that everything moved
irretrievably from order

11:08.240 --> 11:09.719
into chaos.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.078
You do not believe that, do you?

11:14.200 --> 11:15.998
I cannot.

11:16.120 --> 11:20.637
REID: I said the same, because what hope
for Whitechapel if he were right?

11:23.480 --> 11:25.551
You wish for a confession
of truth from me?

11:26.600 --> 11:27.510
I do.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.916
Well, this is it.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.429
Isaac Bloom was correct
in all that he said.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.517
You forget your hopes, sir,

there is a copse of black poplars
at Goodluck Hope.

52:05.720 --> 52:07.870
Perhaps...

52:08.000 --> 52:10.389
(SNIFFS)

52:10.520 --> 52:13.239
...perhaps I ought to go with you?

52:21.240 --> 52:22.799
Whoa!

52:31.320 --> 52:33.391
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

52:33.520 --> 52:35.318
Walk on.

52:52.800 --> 52:53.790
Miss Reid.

52:55.640 --> 52:57.517
You did right to send
for me, Inspector.

52:57.640 --> 52:59.597
This him, then, is it?

52:59.720 --> 53:01.996
Mr Abberline.

53:02.120 --> 53:04.077
On another occasion,
I should be grateful to meet you

53:04.200 --> 53:05.599
and account for actions
we here have taken

53:05.720 --> 53:08.792
which I understand must
surely fill you with horror.

53:08.920 --> 53:14.836
But, our force, we comrades cannot be
seen to fight among ourselves.

53:14.960 --> 53:18.157
My, but you are silky and oiled, boy.

53:18.280 --> 53:22.194
However, I'm not in your force no more

53:22.320 --> 53:27.235
and even were I still,
I would not call you my brother-man.

53:27.360 --> 53:29.476
Then, sir, I think Inspector Drummond must
have his men

53:29.600 --> 53:31.557
escort you from these premises.

53:31.680 --> 53:33.353
Mr Drummond.

53:33.480 --> 53:36.199
You men with me.

53:36.320 --> 53:37.469
NATHANIEL: Gustus.

53:52.160 --> 53:53.912
Good afternoon, Mr Dove.

54:00.280 --> 54:03.989
Inspector Drummond,
my name is Caitlin Swift,

54:04.120 --> 54:06.873
and I wish to surrender myself
to the police.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.320
(RAISED VOICES)

54:13.440 --> 54:16.080
My name is Nathaniel Croker...

54:18.240 --> 54:20.800
...and I too wish to surrender myself
to the police.

54:20.920 --> 54:22.911
For what crime?

54:25.320 --> 54:27.470
I'm sorry, Gustus.

54:29.240 --> 54:30.594
I do not know you, sir.

54:33.440 --> 54:35.351
Which crime?

54:40.760 --> 54:41.750
- Murder.
- (PEOPLE TALK)

54:43.200 --> 54:45.271
- DRUMMOND: Whose?

54:50.160 --> 54:52.595
Rabbi Leon Ratovski.

54:52.720 --> 54:54.472
(RAISED VOICES)

54:55.520 --> 54:58.080
NATHANIEL: Other men,

54:58.200 --> 55:00.760
whose names I did not know...

55:05.640 --> 55:06.789
...and Mr Drake.

55:06.920 --> 55:09.753
(RAISED VOICES)

55:14.120 --> 55:17.238
He known to you, is he, Mr Dove?

55:17.360 --> 55:19.954
He familiar?

55:21.040 --> 55:23.429
I do not know this man.

55:29.760 --> 55:31.671
Get 'em in. Men!

55:33.600 --> 55:36.319
Get them in, all of them! Now!

55:38.920 --> 55:41.036
Mathilda? What is it? What do you do?

55:41.160 --> 55:43.390
Father, I think you must come.

55:45.920 --> 55:47.831
(RAISED VOICES)

55:49.400 --> 55:51.471
just follow procedures, Mr Drummond.

55:51.600 --> 55:54.274
All confessions to be writ,
signed and witnessed.

55:54.400 --> 55:55.993
Yes, sir.

55:56.120 --> 55:59.158
- Renshaw!
- Yes, sir.

55:59.280 --> 56:01.430
You keep away! Right?

56:01.560 --> 56:04.120
- You keep away.
- Nathaniel.

56:04.240 --> 56:05.992
Allow it.

56:06.120 --> 56:08.509
They must see him.

56:32.320 --> 56:35.836
- Who is this boy?
- NATHANIEL: Gustus.

56:35.960 --> 56:37.997
Please.

56:38.120 --> 56:40.680
You know.

56:40.800 --> 56:42.871
Yes, Mr Dove.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.196
- You know.
- (GUN COCKS)

56:45.320 --> 56:48.358
- I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.
- He's not worth the blood.

56:50.520 --> 56:52.238
You taught him...

56:52.360 --> 56:55.034
that he was the beast, did you not?

56:56.040 --> 56:58.839
And that make you more able
to suppress and disguise

56:58.960 --> 57:00.712
your own monstrosity?

57:02.440 --> 57:05.717
Take control of your station house,
Inspector!

57:05.840 --> 57:08.878
Barely have I known you ten minutes, boy,

57:09.000 --> 57:12.994
and already the sound of your voice
makes me want to shit!

57:18.520 --> 57:19.840
Edmund.

57:19.960 --> 57:22.076
REID: Fred.

57:25.600 --> 57:27.159
Samuel Drummond.

57:27.280 --> 57:31.592
You see, your station house has been
overtaken by its prisoners.

57:33.560 --> 57:37.269
You are not to blame.
You were overwhelmed, at gunpoint...

57:42.040 --> 57:45.829
...and your captors then locked down
the station house around you.

58:05.960 --> 58:08.190
(RAISED VOICES)

58:10.160 --> 58:13.949
I knew chaos and horror long before I came
to Whitechapel.

58:15.080 --> 58:16.639
Augustus knew it all.

58:16.760 --> 58:18.831
You're going to leave her be, Drummond.

58:18.960 --> 58:19.472
Caitlin!

58:19.600 --> 58:23.798
ABBERLINE: Think of
what you and I once found.

58:23.920 --> 58:25.638
You are needed here, Mr Reid.
