THE COOLEST JOB.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.324
WELL, SOMETIMES I THINK
I SHOULD BE HANGING OUT

00:56.390 --> 00:59.227
WITH A BETTER CLASS
OF ANIMALS.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.430
OH, COME ON!

DOWN HERE.

YOU KNOW, DAD,
GENETICALLY SPEAKING,

01:11.339 --> 01:14.007

OUR FIRST COUSINS.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.176

I'D AGREE WITH THAT.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.449
NO, I'M SERIOUS. ACTUALLY,
SOME SCIENTISTS SAY

01:21.515 --> 01:24.585
THAT MONKEY DIETS ARE MUCH
MORE EVOLVED THAN OUR OWN.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.887

01:28.956 --> 01:30.658

THAT MONKEYS

01:34.895 --> 01:37.598
EAT SO MANY FRUITS
AND VEGETABLES

01:37.665 --> 01:40.000
IS BECAUSE THEY'RE
NOT SMART ENOUGH

01:40.067 --> 01:41.935
