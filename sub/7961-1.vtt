Again.

01:05.322 --> 01:06.055
Again.

01:06.057 --> 01:07.723
Stay with him.

01:07.725 --> 01:11.393
Slide your feet,
anticipate.

01:11.395 --> 01:13.027
All right.
We'll go again.

01:13.029 --> 01:14.561
Don't give up any ground.
Don't let him get by you.

01:19.199 --> 01:20.932
It's good
to see you, Taylor.

01:20.934 --> 01:22.066
How's your semester going?

01:22.068 --> 01:23.634
It's good.

01:23.635 --> 01:25.201
What did you do over the break?
Did you do anything special?

01:25.204 --> 01:28.505
Special like, uh,
fly somewhere, go boarding,

01:28.507 --> 01:29.506
something like that?

01:29.508 --> 01:31.374
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:31.376 --> 01:33.943
That would be special. No. I-I just
stayed at home, streamed some TV.

01:33.945 --> 01:35.144
That's about as special
as it gets.

01:35.946 --> 01:38.112
Come on, man,
set your feet.

01:38.114 --> 01:39.713
Set your feet.
Don't let him get by you.

01:39.715 --> 01:41.614
Ooh! Stay with him.
Don't give up any ground.

01:41.616 --> 01:43.248
Keep yourself
between the man and the basket.

01:43.250 --> 01:44.349
Stay with him.
Let's go.

01:48.554 --> 01:49.586
And again.

01:49.588 --> 01:51.387
Use your hands
and go up with them.

01:51.389 --> 01:53.122
Finish the play.
Let's go.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.594
Well, have you given
any more thought to college?

01:59.596 --> 02:03.064
I-I've thought about how I can't
pay for it, mm-hmm.

02:03.066 --> 02:04.299
Well, the school
can help

02:04.300 --> 02:05.533
with access
to all kinds of resources.

02:05.535 --> 02:07.101
I mean, we can help
with your student loans

02:07.103 --> 02:09.235
or scholarships
and various grants.

02:09.238 --> 02:11.438
Yeah. I'm never
getting a full ride.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.106
My grades,
they aren't all that.

02:13.108 --> 02:15.942
Wherever I'm going, I'm still
gonna have to pay, so...

02:15.944 --> 02:18.477
Well, have you thought about
what you'd want to major in?

02:18.479 --> 02:21.313
I know I don't
have a lot of options.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.448
You've got
a lot of options.

02:23.450 --> 02:27.017
Look, if you could do anything,
what would you do?

02:29.488 --> 02:30.787
Maybe...

02:32.624 --> 02:33.756
I-I don't know.

02:33.758 --> 02:35.491
Well, you know what?

02:35.493 --> 02:37.092
You really need
to think about this,

02:37.094 --> 02:38.493
'cause next year,
you're going to be a senior,

02:38.495 --> 02:39.961
and these things matter.

02:39.963 --> 02:41.295
Okay, what do you
care about?

02:41.297 --> 02:43.030
What do you want to do
with yourself?

02:47.602 --> 02:48.867
Come on, come on, come on.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.004
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.638
Yeah, you want to take a breather?
No.

02:54.640 --> 02:55.639
Want to keep going?
Yeah.

02:55.641 --> 02:56.806
Huh?
Yes.

02:56.808 --> 02:58.908
Don't let him get by you.
Don't give up ground.

03:07.950 --> 03:09.749
Look, it's all good, man.

03:09.751 --> 03:12.017
Hey, stay in there, all right?
Don't get frustrated.

03:12.019 --> 03:13.952
That's how you get better --
keep going, repetition.

03:13.954 --> 03:16.154
Let's go.

03:46.384 --> 03:48.050
Your school called today.

03:48.052 --> 03:49.117
Yeah?

03:49.119 --> 03:50.184
Your adviser, Ms. Reid. Yeah.

03:50.186 --> 03:52.186
She said
you were in last week,

03:52.188 --> 03:54.354
talking about places
you wanted to apply.

03:56.358 --> 03:59.392
I guess you didn't
really talk about it.

03:59.394 --> 04:02.061
She just, um,
keeps acting

04:02.063 --> 04:04.296
like I'm gonna go to notre dame
or something like that.

04:04.298 --> 04:06.531
If that's what you want.
No, I don't want that.

04:06.533 --> 04:07.836
But she acts like I'm gonna
go someplace like that.

04:07.862 --> 04:08.899
She's just trying
to encourage you.

04:08.901 --> 04:10.534
She's just -- she doesn't
-- she's your counselor.

04:10.536 --> 04:12.702
She just wants you to start
thinking about places like that,

04:12.704 --> 04:14.370
or Michigan...
Yale...

04:14.372 --> 04:15.904
...UCLA, wherever.

04:15.906 --> 04:17.171
She -- she just
wants to make sure

04:17.173 --> 04:18.572
you take applying
seriously.

04:18.574 --> 04:19.639
I'm being real.

04:19.641 --> 04:20.973
They are the ones
not being real.

04:20.975 --> 04:23.742
Do you think
you can't get in?

04:23.744 --> 04:26.144
You should go
where you want.

04:29.549 --> 04:32.982
How's Evy doing?

04:32.984 --> 04:34.083
Okay.

04:34.085 --> 04:35.184
You want to invite her over
Sunday night?

04:35.186 --> 04:37.019
No.

04:37.021 --> 04:38.720
Is everything okay
with you two?

04:38.722 --> 04:40.722
I never should have
gone to that school.

04:40.724 --> 04:44.658
Leyland?
It's a good school.

04:44.660 --> 04:46.493
It's gonna help you
get into college.

04:50.765 --> 04:53.332
Is everything okay
with you and Evy?

04:53.334 --> 04:54.433
I don't want
to go back to that place.

04:54.435 --> 04:57.369
I don't.

04:57.371 --> 04:59.003
I'm gonna get
the rest of the stuff.

05:17.188 --> 05:19.021
Look. Look at this.

05:19.023 --> 05:22.024
That's perfect.

05:25.562 --> 05:29.030
Bitch, give it to me. You're stupid, bro.
What's wrong with you?

05:29.032 --> 05:31.032
All right, man, look, look.
What?

05:31.034 --> 05:33.434
D-damn.
That's Nikki?

05:33.436 --> 05:35.302
Yeah, man.
Bitch looking good, huh?

05:35.304 --> 05:38.104
I <i> so</i> want to rape that.

05:38.106 --> 05:39.238
Wait, I'm-a
text it to you.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.473
No, uh,
don't send that to me.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.608
What? You racist? You don't
pound Asian bitches now?

05:43.610 --> 05:45.977
What? Nikki's not even Asian.
What are you talking about?

05:45.979 --> 05:49.313
Come on. Hit that, bro.

05:49.315 --> 05:51.148
This looks good.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.282
Outside...

05:52.284 --> 05:55.118
And inside and this one.
All right.

05:59.156 --> 06:02.123
It's the Becca show,
front and center, man.

06:02.125 --> 06:04.291
You look good.

06:04.293 --> 06:06.159
Is that the Miley?
Yeah, the Miley.

06:06.161 --> 06:08.761
The Miley. Yeah, I
recognize that one.

06:08.763 --> 06:10.162
Circle?
There we go, yeah.

06:10.164 --> 06:12.497
And the left cheek, right cheek...
Oh!

06:13.266 --> 06:15.966
Oh, man.

06:15.968 --> 06:17.901
She's draw. Okay.

06:17.903 --> 06:19.969
This is a draw.
It is the draw.

06:19.971 --> 06:21.637
Yeah, so...

06:21.639 --> 06:25.240
And then you could do the double.
Oh, so you got -- it's your turn?

06:25.242 --> 06:26.574
You're --
you're going now?

06:28.144 --> 06:29.743
So,
are you coming over or not?

06:29.745 --> 06:31.244
You know I got stuff to do.

06:31.246 --> 06:32.144
What stuff
you got to do?

06:32.146 --> 06:33.778
We have a test Thursday.

06:33.780 --> 06:35.146

You know, before --
no, don't do that, Michael.

08:33.736 --> 08:35.602
Before that one
started coming around,

08:35.604 --> 08:37.337
he could do his homework
without the music on.

08:37.339 --> 08:38.337
Well, what is it?

08:38.340 --> 08:39.371
What do you --
what do you want?

08:39.374 --> 08:40.740
First, you said,
"I'll be happy

08:40.741 --> 08:42.508
if he comes home with a girl
instead of a guy."

08:42.510 --> 08:45.844
Then you said, "a black girl
instead of a white girl."

08:45.846 --> 08:47.679
And now
we have one of those,

08:47.681 --> 08:50.548

Who?

08:52.285 --> 08:55.286

Keep reviewing, folks.

11:10.823 --> 11:12.155
Can I just see Taylor
real quick?

11:12.157 --> 11:13.189
Okay.

11:13.191 --> 11:15.457
Taylor, will you
grab your stuff

11:15.459 --> 11:19.527
and go with Dean hanson,
please?

11:19.529 --> 11:21.562
All right, folks,
it seems like there's...

11:25.233 --> 11:26.899
Ms. Blaine.
Mm-hmm.

11:31.405 --> 11:32.537
Did they
offer you water?

11:32.539 --> 11:34.205
I'm fine.

11:34.207 --> 11:36.173
Ms. Blaine,
I appreciate you coming in.

11:36.175 --> 11:37.707
We need to have
a conversation,

11:37.709 --> 11:39.675
and honestly, it's not
the kind of conversation

11:39.677 --> 11:41.543
we can have on the phone. Okay.

11:41.545 --> 11:43.745
There's a code of conduct
at this school.

11:43.747 --> 11:45.179
We expect all our students
to follow --

11:45.181 --> 11:46.547
is everything
all right?

11:46.549 --> 11:48.982
There's an issue we've had
to address involving Taylor.

11:48.984 --> 11:51.084
There were pictures posted
of your son

11:51.086 --> 11:52.885
which were
outside the code.

11:52.887 --> 11:54.720
Pictures of what?

11:54.722 --> 11:55.987
I can't show you.

11:55.989 --> 11:57.488
Well,
I want to see them.

11:57.490 --> 12:01.391
I can't show you
the pictures, you understand?

12:01.393 --> 12:04.160
<i> Taylor</i> needs to show you
the pictures.

12:04.162 --> 12:06.829
Taylor's counselor, Ms. Reid,
and I spoke with him.

12:06.831 --> 12:09.064
He was given the opportunity
to explain himself.

12:09.066 --> 12:10.231
He chose not to.

12:10.233 --> 12:11.899
We're suspending Taylor
from school.

12:11.901 --> 12:13.525
It's a three-week suspension
beginning as of today.

12:13.551 --> 12:14.668
No. You can't suspend him.

12:14.670 --> 12:16.627
W-what did he do that you
have to suspend him? We

12:16.653 --> 12:18.838
have a code of conduct at
Leyland -- Ms. Blaine!

12:18.840 --> 12:21.240
Once you and Taylor
have had a chance to talk,

12:21.242 --> 12:23.508
when he decides he's ready to go
through the process to be readmit--

12:23.510 --> 12:24.876
process? What process?

12:24.878 --> 12:26.878
There's a process Taylor's gonna
have to go through

12:26.880 --> 12:28.379
in order to be
readmitted to school.

12:28.381 --> 12:31.682
Once he returns to school,
<i> if</i> he's allowed to return,

12:31.684 --> 12:33.316
it's gonna be required --
come on, let's go. Get up.

12:38.555 --> 12:41.889
You are gonna show me
those pictures, you understand?

12:41.891 --> 12:45.125
We get home, you are gonna be
telling me some things.

12:48.696 --> 12:50.195
Get in the car, Taylor.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.933
Taylor,
get in the car --

12:56.935 --> 12:58.000
what?

13:04.641 --> 13:08.209
Taylor,
get in the car.

13:08.211 --> 13:13.080
Get in the car, Taylor.
Get in the car!

13:13.082 --> 13:13.980
What the...?

13:16.284 --> 13:19.952
I can't believe this!

13:19.954 --> 13:22.587
You --

13:22.589 --> 13:25.122
I can't...

13:41.605 --> 13:43.304
You ass.

13:43.306 --> 13:44.905
Hey. You don't talk
like that.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.439
Why are you
taking videos of me?

13:46.441 --> 13:48.841
Oh, you had to show that to her?
You took it.

13:48.843 --> 13:51.276
Yeah, so you can see what your
daughter is doing at school.

13:51.278 --> 13:53.311
Stop spying on me. You're
out in public doing that.

13:53.313 --> 13:54.841
It's not spying if you're
out in public doing that.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.280
I'm not doing anything.
I'm just messing around.

13:56.282 --> 13:58.448
That's -- that's
messing around to you?

13:58.450 --> 14:00.316
It's just
part of the routine.

14:00.318 --> 14:03.419
You don't do a "routine"
in a boy's face.

14:03.421 --> 14:05.988
Wes is a good kid.
It's not about him.

14:05.990 --> 14:07.422
Are you defending --

14:07.424 --> 14:09.791
we're just --
just be mindful.

14:09.793 --> 14:10.858
That's all
we're saying.

14:10.860 --> 14:12.259
You know what?
You don't get it.

14:12.261 --> 14:13.960
We don't -- we don't what?
Don't get what?

14:13.962 --> 14:18.197
We don't get why you need
to shake your butt at some boy?

14:35.349 --> 14:40.151
<i> Why</i> would you
show that to her?

14:40.153 --> 14:41.886
Did you or did you not
send that to me?

14:41.888 --> 14:44.555
Yeah, so that you and I could
have a conversation about it.

14:44.557 --> 14:46.223
I mean, if I wanted
to humiliate her,

14:46.225 --> 14:48.858
I could have done that
at school.

14:48.860 --> 14:52.361
That's what she does when
she knows she's being watched.

14:52.363 --> 14:54.896
And, by the way, those routines
that they're doing,

14:54.898 --> 14:56.631
the one that they did at the
game -- not my department.

14:56.633 --> 14:58.566
That's not me.
That's Pam.

14:58.568 --> 15:00.467
Well -- well,
what's Pam's deal?

15:00.469 --> 15:01.501
Hey, you know?

15:01.503 --> 15:03.135
"Send me your suburban
white girls

15:03.137 --> 15:05.203
so I can teach them
how to dance like hos"?

15:05.205 --> 15:07.538
Suburban white girls
got to learn to dance somewhere.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.340
Yeah.
It's called a strip club.

15:10.342 --> 15:13.309
It's, uh,
strippers and not hos.

Thank you so much
for coming.

15:49.706 --> 15:51.172
You have to go and see
what we are doing.

15:51.174 --> 15:52.072
It is amazing.

15:52.074 --> 15:53.606
Coach Dan
is always honest.

15:53.608 --> 15:55.207
You know, whether
it's in the classroom

15:55.209 --> 15:57.542
or on the court,
you know, he keeps us --

15:57.544 --> 15:59.494
he keeps us
on the right path.

15:59.495 --> 16:01.445
And, you know, that's why
we are always successful.

16:01.447 --> 16:03.213
Not having a father
at a young age,

16:03.215 --> 16:05.682
coach Dan
was like my father figure.

16:05.684 --> 16:07.583
He really pushed me.

16:07.585 --> 16:08.951
I feel like he made me
a better man.

16:08.953 --> 16:12.454
Coach Dan -- you know,
he's, uh -- he's got us winning.

16:12.456 --> 16:14.889
So, no lie,
that feels good.

16:14.891 --> 16:18.025
Um...You know,
he teaches us to be the best,

16:18.027 --> 16:19.226
and we are the best.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.428
We're a team,
and coach Dan --

16:21.430 --> 16:23.229
he makes sure
we know we're a team.

16:23.231 --> 16:25.631
On the court or off the court,
everything we do,

16:25.633 --> 16:27.633
it's just -- it's
about doing for each other

16:27.635 --> 16:29.735
and being down
for each other.

16:29.737 --> 16:32.070
So, yeah,
I-I can't thank him enough.

16:32.072 --> 16:35.773
Isn't that something?
Isn't that beautiful?

16:35.775 --> 16:39.076
These young men,
all wonderful individuals,

16:39.078 --> 16:41.878
working together
for a common goal,

16:41.880 --> 16:44.580
not just
winning basketball games,

16:44.582 --> 16:48.650
but being there for each other,
supporting each other,

16:48.652 --> 16:51.552
bringing out the best
in each other.

16:51.554 --> 16:54.054
Six years ago,
the Leyland school was blessed

16:54.056 --> 16:56.623
with the arrival
of Dan Sullivan.

16:58.760 --> 17:02.661
Four winning seasons,
a state championship --

17:02.663 --> 17:06.598
all of that
in just six years.

17:06.599 --> 17:09.567
Now, that was also when I became
headmaster of the school,

17:09.569 --> 17:11.167
but...

17:11.170 --> 17:14.003
...I'm not gonna take credit
for Dan's work.

17:15.607 --> 17:18.674
Our mission
is to provide young people

17:18.675 --> 17:21.977
with the environment they need
to excel.

17:21.979 --> 17:25.347
We proudly participate
in the state voucher program,

17:25.348 --> 17:28.750
provide financial aid
for deserving students,

17:28.752 --> 17:30.818
and we want
to do more.

17:30.820 --> 17:34.655
We're more than halfway
into our capital campaign,

17:34.657 --> 17:38.025
$32 million in hand!

17:38.027 --> 17:40.694
We have
just $18 million to go.

17:40.696 --> 17:42.962
That's the future
of the Leyland school.

17:42.964 --> 17:44.863
That's the future
of education.

17:44.865 --> 17:47.532
Everyone here
can make it happen.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.668
So raise your glasses,
take a gulp,

17:50.670 --> 17:53.937
get out your checkbooks,
and start writing.

17:53.939 --> 17:55.805
Thank you all so much.

17:57.675 --> 17:59.174
Thank you.

18:07.049 --> 18:09.482
<i> Welcome back!</i>

Hey. Let me get it.

18:24.196 --> 18:25.728
Oh, no, no.
I'm good.

18:25.730 --> 18:26.995
Okay.

18:26.997 --> 18:28.062
Are you okay?

18:28.064 --> 18:29.830
A little bit sore.

18:29.832 --> 18:33.700
Hey, let me get you.

18:53.153 --> 18:55.086
Are you good?
Yeah?

18:55.088 --> 18:56.320

19:09.099 --> 19:10.031

19:11.434 --> 19:13.534

19:13.536 --> 19:17.937
<i> Our product is guaranteed</i>

19:17.939 --> 19:22.107

<i> Come on down to pick up our</i>

19:27.113 --> 19:28.178
<i> Come on over.</i>

19:53.468 --> 19:56.969
I'm gonna go out
for a minute, okay?

20:07.213 --> 20:08.612
He won't talk to me.

20:08.614 --> 20:10.614
He won't say anything.

20:10.616 --> 20:12.982
He's quiet, angry.

20:15.219 --> 20:17.519
But he won't
tell me what's going on.

20:22.225 --> 20:23.990
There are pictures.
Have you seen them?

20:26.127 --> 20:27.993
What's he doing?

20:27.995 --> 20:31.162
Just dumb stuff.

20:31.164 --> 20:33.097
Do you have them?

20:33.099 --> 20:35.165
They got sent around.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.616
I want to see them.

20:36.617 --> 20:38.066
Kids were putting up
messages with them.

20:38.069 --> 20:40.502
They were saying nasty stuff.
I don't care.

20:40.504 --> 20:42.369
I want to see
the pictures.

20:53.581 --> 20:55.047
Ugh.

21:07.092 --> 21:09.358
What's "w.T."?
White trash.

21:11.095 --> 21:12.493
Mm.

21:14.930 --> 21:15.995
Were you there
with him?

21:15.997 --> 21:17.596
There was a party.

21:17.598 --> 21:19.030
It was for
the basketball team.

21:19.032 --> 21:20.831
It was supposed to be
a big deal.

21:20.833 --> 21:22.499
Taylor never gets invited
anywhere,

21:22.501 --> 21:25.034
so he said
I could go, too.

21:25.036 --> 21:27.102
W-who invited him?

21:27.104 --> 21:30.771
This kid Kevin,
I think.

21:30.773 --> 21:33.006
We went.

21:33.008 --> 21:36.309
We kind of
split up some.

21:36.311 --> 21:38.177
He was hanging out with
some of the guys on the team,

21:38.179 --> 21:42.280
and he left me
with these girls.

21:44.317 --> 21:46.283
They were all bitches.

21:46.285 --> 21:48.118
They were all cutting me
with their eyes

21:48.120 --> 21:49.786
'cause my clothes
weren't all this and that

21:49.788 --> 21:52.488
and my phone's jacked.

21:52.490 --> 21:56.825
They didn't even try
to hide it.

21:56.827 --> 21:58.893
I wasn't gonna eat
their...

21:58.895 --> 22:02.729
So I went to go look for Taylor,
and when I found him...

22:04.799 --> 22:07.166
...he was messed up.

22:07.168 --> 22:10.335
He was <i> really</i>
messed up.

22:10.337 --> 22:13.004
And all those guys
were just standing around

22:13.006 --> 22:15.272
and taking those pictures
and busting on him.

22:17.709 --> 22:21.577
One of them,
he finally got Taylor to a car.

22:21.579 --> 22:24.212
They just dumped us
back at your place.

22:26.082 --> 22:30.150
Why didn't you call me?
He didn't want me to.

22:30.152 --> 22:32.752
He felt bad.

22:32.754 --> 22:34.854
He should feel bad.

22:34.856 --> 22:36.155
You both should.

22:51.337 --> 22:53.203
Whoo!

22:53.205 --> 22:55.205
Everybody,

23:26.095 --> 23:28.929
Let's go, knights!
Let's go, knights!

23:28.931 --> 23:31.064
Let's go!

23:38.538 --> 23:40.871
That's it, that's it!
Go hard!

23:40.873 --> 23:43.106
Left, left, left!

23:44.275 --> 23:47.109
Ref, come on.

23:47.111 --> 23:48.810
Keep it cool, kev.
Keep it cool.

23:52.381 --> 23:52.979
Sub in.
Sub in.

23:54.549 --> 23:57.483
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Foul trouble, babe.

23:57.485 --> 23:59.651
Look, you got four fouls,
all right?

23:59.653 --> 24:00.988
He's fouling me -- all right.
It's all right.

24:01.014 --> 24:01.652
It's all right.

24:01.654 --> 24:04.254
We'll get you
right back in, all right?

24:09.794 --> 24:10.826
Stay with him!

24:16.999 --> 24:19.899
All right, all right, all right!
All right.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.769
Come on!
Come on, come on!

24:23.771 --> 24:25.237
To your left,
to your left!

24:25.239 --> 24:26.304
Do it, do it!

24:26.306 --> 24:28.906
Right there!
You got it, you got it!

24:32.644 --> 24:34.577
Eric, come on!
You got to stay in the game!

24:34.579 --> 24:36.011
You're all right!
It's all right!

24:47.023 --> 24:49.523
Way to go, Jordan!

24:49.525 --> 24:50.524
Time-out!

24:50.526 --> 24:51.892
Time-out.

24:53.929 --> 24:55.528
Okay, now we better put kev
back in the game.

24:55.530 --> 24:56.762
Bring it in, guys.
Bring it in.

24:56.764 --> 24:58.463
We got this.
We're just -- we're down by 2.

24:58.465 --> 24:59.664
All right, kev,
it's all you.

24:59.666 --> 25:00.931
Roll out on the top
and take it.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.533
All right. 6 is back in.
You got to stay on your man.

25:03.535 --> 25:04.767
Be mindful of the clock.

25:04.769 --> 25:06.268
We got just under
nine seconds.

25:06.270 --> 25:07.335
You got it. Let's go.

25:07.337 --> 25:09.770
Bring it in, bring it in.
Come on, come on!

25:09.772 --> 25:11.138
1...2...3!
Knights!

25:20.948 --> 25:21.947
Let's go, kev!

25:28.821 --> 25:33.322
5...4...3...2...1!

25:39.896 --> 25:41.962
Yeah!

25:45.834 --> 25:47.366
Why didn't he
take the shot?

25:47.368 --> 25:49.968
I'm serious.

25:49.970 --> 25:51.235
We won, baby.

25:57.676 --> 25:59.342
Were you
supposed to take that last shot.

25:59.344 --> 26:01.077
If I was open, yeah.

26:01.079 --> 26:03.879
So you were
supposed to take it.

26:03.881 --> 26:05.547
If I was open, yes.

26:05.549 --> 26:07.148
That was your ball.

26:07.150 --> 26:09.750
Well, he really didn't have
a look.

26:09.752 --> 26:11.752
He had
a good enough shot.

26:11.754 --> 26:14.821
You don't just pass it off
to somebody else.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.889
You know, for somebody that
didn't even like basketball,

26:16.891 --> 26:19.157
you're started to kind of -- I
don't care a thing about it.

26:19.159 --> 26:21.893
I don't, and that's
not even what I'm talking about.

26:21.895 --> 26:25.329
That was your ball.
You take the shot.

26:59.463 --> 27:01.429
I talked to Evy.

27:01.431 --> 27:03.764
I saw the pictures.

27:03.766 --> 27:04.531
Leave it.

27:04.533 --> 27:06.132
Those are online.

27:06.134 --> 27:08.134
Kids are just sending them around.
Just leave it alone, please.

27:08.136 --> 27:10.736
They're there forever.

27:10.738 --> 27:14.272
Do you know -- you know --
unh-unh, no, no.

27:14.274 --> 27:15.940
Do you know...

27:15.942 --> 27:20.110
How hard it was
to get you into that school?

27:20.112 --> 27:21.744
I mean, do you --
do you understand

27:21.746 --> 27:23.245
how much it takes
out of this house?!

27:23.247 --> 27:26.648
And you get kicked out
for doing something stupid?!

27:26.650 --> 27:28.449
I mean, what --
what were you doing?!

27:28.451 --> 27:30.150
I...
I-I don't know.

27:30.152 --> 27:31.484
You <i> do</i> know.
No.

27:31.486 --> 27:34.053
You do! That's why lied to me!
No!

27:34.055 --> 27:35.654
Tell me right now!
Stop, please!

27:35.656 --> 27:37.122
Would you just tell me?! Because
I'm gonna find out! Stop, stop!

27:37.124 --> 27:39.057
I don't know!
Tell me right now what --

27:39.059 --> 27:42.026
I don't know!
I don't know what happened!

27:46.832 --> 27:48.932
I had a couple of beers, yeah.
You were drinking?

27:48.934 --> 27:51.901
They kept sh-- they kept
shoving them in my face.

27:51.903 --> 27:53.569
Who?
Who was doing this?

27:53.571 --> 27:56.104
Guys on the team.
They were telling me to be fun.

27:56.106 --> 27:57.271
"Why don't you be fun?"

27:57.273 --> 27:58.739
They were angry about it.
"Just be fun."

27:58.741 --> 28:02.075
So I wanted them to stop.
I had a beer.

28:02.077 --> 28:03.276
And then everything got messed up.
Messed up how?

28:03.278 --> 28:04.910
I couldn't stand up.
I felt sick.

28:04.912 --> 28:06.945
They were grabbing at me, laughing at me...
Where was Evy?

28:06.947 --> 28:08.313
...taking those pictures.

28:08.315 --> 28:12.016
No one was helping you when
you were down there like that?

28:12.018 --> 28:14.685
I don't know.

28:14.687 --> 28:17.821
I don't remember.
I just -- I, um...

28:17.823 --> 28:20.256
I know...

28:20.258 --> 28:21.357
I wasn't lying.

28:21.359 --> 28:25.927
I just --
I didn't tell you because...

28:25.929 --> 28:26.961
I was ashamed.

28:26.963 --> 28:29.063
I was, um -- so...

28:32.835 --> 28:34.334
Mom, I, um...

28:38.272 --> 28:39.771
They did something to me.

28:39.773 --> 28:41.172
I think someone...

28:41.174 --> 28:44.208
I think
someone did something to me.

28:51.716 --> 28:53.115
Mom...

29:36.756 --> 29:38.589
Hold on, hold on.

29:38.591 --> 29:41.091
Let's go back.

29:41.093 --> 29:45.695
When you do that first move,
relax into it, okay?

29:45.697 --> 29:47.329
Don't announce.

29:47.331 --> 29:48.596
Just let it flow.

29:48.598 --> 29:50.764
Okay?
Let's go again.

30:25.930 --> 30:27.863
Anne?
Leslie Graham.

30:27.865 --> 30:32.567
We met last summer
during the school orientation.

30:32.569 --> 30:35.870
Well, I wish we could be
sitting down for other reasons,

30:35.872 --> 30:37.805
but I obviously know
about your son's situation

30:37.807 --> 30:39.473
and the pictures
that were posted online,

30:39.475 --> 30:41.775
but Dean hanson told me
you think there might be

30:41.777 --> 30:42.809
more to this story.

30:42.811 --> 30:44.877
My son was assaulted.

30:44.879 --> 30:46.712
Let's talk about it.

30:46.714 --> 30:48.747
Tell me what you believe
happened -- thank you.

30:48.749 --> 30:50.281
There was a party.
Taylor was invited.

30:50.283 --> 30:51.982
T-t-there were other kids there.
Whose party?

30:51.984 --> 30:53.950
Do you know where the party was held?
I don't know.

30:53.952 --> 30:56.152
- Something for the basketball team.
- The captains' party?

30:56.154 --> 30:57.887
That's what you're talking about?
I don't know.

30:57.889 --> 31:01.123
He was invited, and -- and --
and there was kids there,

31:01.125 --> 31:02.290
and they were drinking.

31:02.292 --> 31:03.424
Was your son drinking?

31:03.426 --> 31:05.726
He did have some.
He admits it.

31:05.728 --> 31:09.096
I know you've seen pictures
of him, but he wasn't drunk.

31:09.098 --> 31:10.464
Someone
gave him something.

31:10.466 --> 31:12.799
Gave him?
Drugs or something.

31:12.801 --> 31:17.302
But you're saying <i> gave</i> him? He
didn't take them voluntarily? No.

31:17.304 --> 31:18.670
Someone
gave him something.

31:18.672 --> 31:20.805
They gave him drugs,
and then they assaulted him.

31:20.807 --> 31:23.974
Physically assaulted?

31:23.976 --> 31:25.909
Sexually assaulted?

31:25.911 --> 31:27.243
Sexual.

31:28.946 --> 31:32.514
What did he say
that makes you believe that?

31:32.516 --> 31:35.083
It's, uh --
it's what he <i> didn't</i> say.

31:35.085 --> 31:37.885
It's -- it's things
he couldn't talk about.

31:39.922 --> 31:42.188
Why do you believe someone
might have hurt your son?

31:42.190 --> 31:43.189
He doesn't fit in.

31:43.191 --> 31:45.791
He's on financial aid --
white trash.

31:45.793 --> 31:47.159
We don't make judgments
based on --

31:47.161 --> 31:49.794
well, I've seen texts going around
calling him that, so it happens.

31:49.796 --> 31:51.962
When Taylor got home
that evening,

31:51.964 --> 31:55.865
did you notice anything
about him, about his behavior?

31:55.867 --> 31:59.001
I wasn't home.
I was working.

32:02.139 --> 32:04.806
Someone invited your son
to this party,

32:04.808 --> 32:07.041
gave him drugs
without his knowledge,

32:07.043 --> 32:11.644
and then they touched him or
violated him against his will?

32:11.646 --> 32:13.646
Yes.

32:13.648 --> 32:17.716
The captains' party was -- it
would have been last Saturday.

32:17.718 --> 32:20.785
And this is the first time
Taylor said anything to you

32:20.787 --> 32:22.119
after you found out
about the pictures?

32:22.121 --> 32:24.221
Yes.

32:24.223 --> 32:28.123
Ms. Blaine, we take
your concerns very seriously.

32:28.125 --> 32:29.624
We are going
to look into this,

32:29.626 --> 32:31.058
and we are gonna do so
immediately.

32:31.060 --> 32:33.727
This is obviously
a sensitive subject.

32:33.729 --> 32:35.862
Until we can determine
what happened --

32:35.864 --> 32:37.897
I told you
what happened.

32:37.899 --> 32:39.698
Until we can support that,

32:39.700 --> 32:43.367
I would just ask that we
keep the matter confidential,

32:43.369 --> 32:45.068
for everyone's sake.

32:45.070 --> 32:47.670
I would ask that you trust
we will do all we can

32:47.672 --> 32:49.905
to get this right.

32:53.076 --> 32:55.042
Okay.

32:55.044 --> 33:00.914
This is just acknowledging
that you met with us

33:00.916 --> 33:02.882
and that
you gave a statement.

33:07.187 --> 33:08.819
Thank you.

33:08.821 --> 33:10.086
Would you witness this?

33:12.590 --> 33:14.923
We mean what we say.

33:14.925 --> 33:16.190
We'll get answers.

33:16.192 --> 33:18.759
And I appreciate --
I deeply appreciate

33:18.761 --> 33:21.061
you coming to us
with this situation.

33:24.399 --> 33:25.965
You gonna be okay
to get home?

33:32.439 --> 33:33.971
Okay.

33:50.022 --> 33:54.023
Dan, do you have a second?
We had a parent come in.

33:54.025 --> 33:56.392
Some...
Allegations were made.

33:56.394 --> 33:59.061
- Allegations -- the best way to phrase it.
- Allegations about?

33:59.063 --> 34:00.962
Something happened
at the captains' party.

34:00.964 --> 34:02.964
A student is claiming
to have been assaulted.

34:02.966 --> 34:04.966
Wait, wait -- by one of my players?
Yeah.

34:04.968 --> 34:06.567
Well, you know
that's a lie.

34:06.569 --> 34:07.901
Well, it may be,

34:07.903 --> 34:09.768
but there <i> were</i> things
happening at that party.

34:09.771 --> 34:11.437
Don't think your kids
are above mistakes.

34:11.438 --> 34:12.971
You need
to talk to your players.

34:12.973 --> 34:16.574
We have to make it clear
we take this matter seriously,

34:16.576 --> 34:18.042
give them the opportunity

34:18.043 --> 34:20.277
to offer up any information
they might have.

34:20.279 --> 34:21.378
Who's saying this?

34:22.214 --> 34:23.379
You need
to be objective.

34:23.380 --> 34:24.913
I don't want to bias
what you might hear.

34:24.915 --> 34:26.813
But, I mean,
you know if -- if you --

34:26.815 --> 34:28.882
if it feels real
or if it's just talk.

34:28.884 --> 34:29.916
Well, that's what
we don't want --

34:29.918 --> 34:31.717
for talk to get around,
social media.

34:31.719 --> 34:33.585
Everything happens
quickly.

34:33.587 --> 34:36.054
There were parts
of the story

34:36.056 --> 34:38.156
the accuser wasn't
particularly specific about.

34:38.158 --> 34:41.893
I don't know if much happened
beyond some bad judgment.

34:41.895 --> 34:43.661
Oh, I'll bring them in,
talk to them.

34:43.663 --> 34:45.562
Talk to <i> all</i> your players
together.

34:45.563 --> 34:47.597
Avoid any of them
feeling singled out.

34:47.599 --> 34:49.130
That would be
my suggestion.

34:49.132 --> 34:52.734
If there is anything,
bring it to my attention.

34:52.735 --> 34:53.967
If there's nothing --

34:53.969 --> 34:55.402
oh, we'll find that out
real fast.

34:55.404 --> 34:57.504
Well, then,
that's the end of it.

34:57.506 --> 34:58.738
They trust you.

34:58.740 --> 35:00.906
That means a lot more
than me going down there

35:00.908 --> 35:04.308
and turning it
into an inquisition.

35:04.310 --> 35:05.075
Okay?

35:05.077 --> 35:06.776
Mm-hmm.

35:06.778 --> 35:08.844
Okay.

35:22.023 --> 35:23.589
Dan!

35:23.591 --> 35:24.856
Dan!

35:26.459 --> 35:28.725
Bring it in.
Bring it in.

35:30.695 --> 35:32.528
Everybody hear me?

35:35.599 --> 35:37.182
Yes, sir.

35:37.183 --> 35:38.766
You know, one of the --
one of the things we...

35:38.768 --> 35:42.202
We talk about a lot
is how you represent,

35:42.204 --> 35:44.170
you know, on the court,
off the court.

35:44.172 --> 35:48.306
Everything we do,
it's about each other --

35:48.308 --> 35:53.143
the school, students, faculty,
<i> everybody.</i>

35:53.145 --> 35:55.778
It's about respect.

35:55.780 --> 36:02.551
It's being respected
and how others view us.

36:02.553 --> 36:04.051
There was, um...

36:06.989 --> 36:10.023
You all had the captains' party
last Saturday.

36:17.699 --> 36:19.732
We need to talk about that.

36:25.673 --> 36:26.805
You all right?

36:26.807 --> 36:28.573
Me? Yeah.

36:28.575 --> 36:30.241
Did it get messy?

36:30.243 --> 36:31.575
You know what it is?

36:31.577 --> 36:33.543
Somebody going, "I'm hearing
a noise in the basement.

36:33.545 --> 36:35.244
Go see if we've got rats."

36:35.246 --> 36:37.479
Well, you know,
then I'm the one.

36:37.481 --> 36:39.881
I got to go in
and start rooting around.

36:39.883 --> 36:42.650
And I got these guys --
they're looking at me like --

36:42.652 --> 36:46.653
you know,
like I-I was accusing them.

36:46.655 --> 36:49.055
Well, you were told
to talk to them.

36:49.057 --> 36:51.657
No, I was told
to go in and tell them.

36:51.659 --> 36:54.026
It wasn't even,
"did you do something?"

36:54.028 --> 36:57.329
It's, "what did you do?"

37:01.367 --> 37:02.699
What'd you tell Leslie?

37:02.701 --> 37:03.733
Nothing.

37:03.735 --> 37:06.068
No, no, thanks.

37:06.070 --> 37:09.538
I mean, if there was something,
I'd know something...

37:09.540 --> 37:10.605
If there was something.

37:10.607 --> 37:12.239
You know, what I --
what I really don't like --

37:12.241 --> 37:13.707
I don't like that I'm the one
that's got to go in

37:13.709 --> 37:15.709
and dig the dirt.

37:15.711 --> 37:18.745
Well, it's not
about <i> you.</i>

37:22.750 --> 37:26.384
Hey, we need
to talk with Becca.

37:26.386 --> 37:27.852
She wasn't at the party.

37:27.854 --> 37:30.721
She is a cheerleader.
Some of them were there.

37:30.723 --> 37:33.423
I-I do not want her
at those parties.

37:33.425 --> 37:37.627
Are we gonna lock her
in her room?

37:37.629 --> 37:44.099
God, I absolutely missed
that turn in life -- that...

37:46.403 --> 37:49.570
In high school, we used to brush
by the boys in the hallway,

37:49.572 --> 37:51.772
just to see
if we could make them hard.

37:52.741 --> 37:54.707
And now I've got
this 17-year-old daughter

37:54.709 --> 37:57.376
who thinks her mother is,
you know, whatever.

37:57.378 --> 37:59.611
Eh. She's fine.
Frigid or whatever.

37:59.613 --> 38:02.747
She's just, you know?
We're getting so old.

38:03.916 --> 38:07.883
Isn't it weird to think
that people our age,

38:07.885 --> 38:11.819
they used to be
getting ready to die.

38:11.821 --> 38:14.988
You turn 50...

38:14.990 --> 38:16.823
You're not 50 yet.

38:16.825 --> 38:18.658
I have one more week.

38:18.660 --> 38:22.828
You turn 50, and then you've got
like five good years,

38:22.830 --> 38:25.463
and then you die.

38:27.567 --> 38:31.468
We're not that old yet,
I guess.

38:31.470 --> 38:34.937
Hey, what do you want to do
about Becca?

38:34.939 --> 38:36.571
Me?
Yeah.

38:36.573 --> 38:37.972
It's a -- it's
a mom/daughter talk.

38:37.974 --> 38:40.007
No, no.
It's better coming from you.

38:40.009 --> 38:43.443
This is
a penis conversation.

38:43.445 --> 38:45.978
Every one of them
has got its eye on her.

38:45.980 --> 38:47.813
It can't be a sex talk.

38:47.815 --> 38:49.848
It's got to be
a trust talk, you know?

38:49.850 --> 38:51.683
I don't want her to think
she can't ever come to us

38:51.685 --> 38:53.017
with her stuff.

38:56.788 --> 38:59.855
You falling asleep?

38:59.857 --> 39:01.823
Sorry.

39:03.827 --> 39:05.859
Mm.

39:22.442 --> 39:25.009
How is Taylor doing?

39:25.011 --> 39:26.543
He's all right.

39:26.545 --> 39:28.478
He seems to be coping?

39:28.480 --> 39:29.879
No, not really.

39:29.881 --> 39:32.982
Oh, I would hope during
this time that he stays engaged.

39:32.984 --> 39:34.717
If he needs help
with schoolwork,

39:34.719 --> 39:36.485
please know
he still has access

39:36.487 --> 39:38.186
to teachers
and to resources online.

39:38.188 --> 39:39.720
What are you doing
about what happened to him?

39:39.722 --> 39:40.987
We looked into
the situation,

39:40.989 --> 39:43.189
and there are individuals
who will be disciplined.

39:43.191 --> 39:45.024
Disciplined? How?

39:45.026 --> 39:47.126
I can't go into specifics
with you.

39:47.128 --> 39:49.895
Anyone who's involved deserves
a measure of privacy.

39:49.897 --> 39:54.132
Well, y-you don't care
about my son's privacy.

39:54.134 --> 39:58.202
There are pictures of your son
engaged in lewd behavior. No.

39:58.204 --> 40:00.871
What he was doing he was doing in public.
What he was doing?

40:00.873 --> 40:02.451
What <i> he</i> was doing? You
mean what was done to him!

40:02.477 --> 40:03.840
You asked us to look
into this, and we did.

40:03.842 --> 40:07.410
No, what was done to him!
My son was raped!

40:10.681 --> 40:12.347
You need to be careful
with that word.

40:12.349 --> 40:15.850
If somebody messed him up,
they touched him...

40:15.852 --> 40:17.617
That is rape.

40:20.388 --> 40:23.822
You need to be very careful
with that word.

40:23.824 --> 40:25.690
You sat in that room.
You were emotional.

40:25.692 --> 40:29.193
You told a story that was barely
coherent and made accusations,

40:29.195 --> 40:32.196
as you put it, based
on things your son <i> didn't</i> say.

40:32.198 --> 40:33.163
He was drugged.

40:33.165 --> 40:35.098
His girlfriend was there.
She saw him.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.999
You came in
and made a statement.

40:37.001 --> 40:38.600
Six times,
you used the phrase

40:38.602 --> 40:41.369
"I don't know"
or "I'm not sure."

40:41.371 --> 40:42.837
You signed that statement.

40:42.839 --> 40:45.005
Just to say
that I talked to somebody!

40:45.007 --> 40:47.207
Your son didn't volunteer
to come forward.

40:47.209 --> 40:49.042
You're making a claim
in his absence

40:49.044 --> 40:50.376
only <i> after</i>
the pictures surfaced.

40:50.378 --> 40:52.378
I came in
as soon as I knew.

40:52.380 --> 40:56.281
We've taken disciplinary action appropriate
-- what are you doing to those boys?!

40:56.283 --> 40:59.017
Tell me what you're doing to the boys!
The suspension given your son is fair,

40:59.019 --> 41:00.985
and it's correct.

41:02.521 --> 41:04.621
Take the time
to be with your son,

41:04.623 --> 41:07.356
to engage him,
to help him make better choices.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.393
He didn't choose this.

41:11.395 --> 41:13.027
I know you want
to believe your son,

41:13.029 --> 41:14.895
but consider
what it means

41:14.897 --> 41:17.530
to falsely accuse
other young men

41:17.532 --> 41:19.765
of something that is --

41:19.767 --> 41:22.400
quite frankly,
it's bizarre.

41:22.402 --> 41:25.369
As bad as it may seem,
it can get worse.

41:28.574 --> 41:30.106
We have counseling services

41:30.108 --> 41:32.408
if you and your son would like
to speak with... Got to go.

42:02.437 --> 42:04.403
911.
What's your emergency?

42:08.075 --> 42:09.941
Yeah...

42:09.943 --> 42:11.075
Hello?

42:14.580 --> 42:17.814
I want to report a rape.

42:17.816 --> 42:19.448
Please.
