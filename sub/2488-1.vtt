00:23.607 --> 00:25.359
Oh, my God.
Enough, camera addict.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.046
Man: Okay, okay.
Just a second, though.

00:27.069 --> 00:29.309
Before I turn it off, what is
your New Year's resolution?

00:29.333 --> 00:30.664
Ha! Really?

00:30.822 --> 00:33.182
Yeah, I want to get it on tape
so that I can hold you to it.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.452
Please, you don't keep those.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.666
That is a fantastic attitude
you have right there.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.171
We're going to this time.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.674
Yeah? All right, fine.
( clears throat )

00:40.832 --> 00:43.130
I solemnly swear

00:43.293 --> 00:45.716
on this New Year's resolution

00:45.879 --> 00:48.473
to go to the gym
and get in shape.

00:48.632 --> 00:49.804
Oh, hell, yeah.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.248
How about you, ladybug?
What's your New Year's resolution?

00:52.261 --> 00:53.478
What's that?

00:53.637 --> 00:57.312
It's like a vow or a promise that
you make to be a better person.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.568
Yeah, or always eat
your spinach.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.478
- Yuck.
- Okay, I got one for you.

01:01.645 --> 01:04.325
How about you tell your mommy
that you love her at least once a day?

01:04.349 --> 01:06.450
- Okay.
- You can start right now.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.736
- I love you, Mom.
- How about you, Fishbone?

01:08.902 --> 01:10.495
What's your resolution?

01:10.654 --> 01:12.702
- Your turn.
- My resolution.

01:12.864 --> 01:14.832
To make a documentary
about this family

01:14.992 --> 01:16.710
so that I can show
the whole world

01:16.868 --> 01:18.415
what a lucky guy I am.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.339
- Woman: You are a lucky guy.
- That's right.

01:20.363 --> 01:22.291
And I thank God every day.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.050
If only you believed in God.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.769
Yeah, that'd probably help
a little bit.

01:25.836 --> 01:27.258
Oh, crap.
You know what?

01:27.421 --> 01:29.781
I didn't put change in that meter.
We're gonna get a ticket.

01:29.805 --> 01:31.600
- Dad, can you help me?
- What's up?

01:31.758 --> 01:32.878
- Here, I got it.
- You sure?

01:32.926 --> 01:34.303
- Yup.
- Thanks, babe.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.687
So, Beverly,
your psychic powers,

01:43.854 --> 01:45.652
when did you first
discover them?

01:45.814 --> 01:48.533
Well, everyone's born
with them, you know.

01:48.692 --> 01:52.117
But most folks don't know
how to develop them.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.656
Man:
And your predictions,

01:53.822 --> 01:55.462
how many of them you think
have come true?

01:55.486 --> 01:57.788
Well, all of them.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.328
( laughs )

01:59.494 --> 02:01.462
Man: Have you ever felt like
you were preying

02:01.622 --> 02:03.340
on someone's superstitions?

02:03.498 --> 02:05.171
Or their emotions?

02:05.334 --> 02:07.336
You know, for example,
like telling a mother

02:07.502 --> 02:09.880
that her missing son
would return alive

02:10.047 --> 02:13.017
or breaking up a family
by advising for divorce.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.935
You know what I mean?
Have you ever felt like

02:14.959 --> 02:17.062
you led somebody down
the wrong path?

02:17.220 --> 02:19.393
No, I don't think so.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.308
You know, it's interesting,

02:21.475 --> 02:23.898
my wife, she's always
wanted to go to Europe.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.029
I finally put
this big trip together,

02:26.188 --> 02:28.862
then at the last second,
she cancels.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.901
She says that she needed
to be here

02:31.068 --> 02:33.742
for this big break
in her acting career.

02:33.904 --> 02:37.204
A break that you told her
was coming.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.368
I did.

02:41.536 --> 02:44.005
And I'm guessing it hasn't, huh?

02:44.164 --> 02:45.916
No.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.215
It will.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.925
Yeah, I don't think so.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.261
And why is that?

02:55.842 --> 02:57.765
She's dead.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.975
Her name was Samantha.
Samantha King.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.143
Yeah. She'd been coming
to you for years.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.363
Oh, Sa...

03:08.522 --> 03:10.900
Oh, Samantha.
Oh, gosh.

03:11.066 --> 03:13.319
Fluke accident.
Wrong place, wrong time.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.954
But, you know,
the funny thing is

03:16.113 --> 03:20.459
is that if we'd been
on that trip,

03:20.617 --> 03:23.837
if she hadn't listened to you
and we'd gone to Europe,

03:23.995 --> 03:25.668
she'd still be alive.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.708
Oh, God.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.467
Oh, you can't think that I had...

03:29.626 --> 03:33.051
You were giving her
spiritual guidance.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.966
Guidance based on visions
you were receiving

03:36.133 --> 03:38.852
from beyond the veil,
from higher powers, right?

03:39.010 --> 03:40.182
And these visions,

03:40.345 --> 03:43.474
they interfered
with her life, Beverly.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.689
And she is dead
as a direct result.

03:46.852 --> 03:50.277
I am deeply sorry for your loss.

03:50.439 --> 03:52.191
Okay, then admit it.
Admit it.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.201
Admit that all this,
this is just a scam.

03:55.360 --> 03:59.456
That what you claim to do,
your psychic routine...

03:59.614 --> 04:01.491
this is just a show, right?

04:01.658 --> 04:03.660
This is a performance here.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.333
Come on, Beverly.
Come on.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.878
I'm afraid that I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.632
Please?

04:19.926 --> 04:22.520
Man:
What happens when you die?

04:23.597 --> 04:26.225
I mean, everybody
has a theory, a guess,

04:26.391 --> 04:28.018
a story that they'd like
to believe.

04:28.185 --> 04:31.405
But at the end of the day,
we don't know.

04:31.563 --> 04:34.191
Our ancestors worshiped fire

04:34.357 --> 04:37.406
and sacrificed children
to vengeful gods.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.872
We didn't know any better
back then.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.284
What's our excuse now?

04:43.450 --> 04:44.872
It's the 21st century,

04:45.035 --> 04:47.914
yet we're still arguing evolution
versus creationism.

04:48.079 --> 04:49.752
And Why?

04:49.915 --> 04:52.885
Because the truth scares people.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.296
Nobody wants to die.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.216
Nobody wants to cease to exist.

04:59.382 --> 05:02.602
We want to believe
that if we follow a set of rules,

05:02.761 --> 05:06.186
rules that were laid out
by some ancient, made-up god,

05:06.348 --> 05:09.522
we're gonna continue on
in heaven as a spirit.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.561
We're gonna be reincarnated.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.399
While all that sounds great,

05:15.565 --> 05:17.442
is any of it authentic?

05:17.609 --> 05:19.327
I mean, what's the truth?

05:20.487 --> 05:23.240
See, the truth is
that religion and spiritualism

05:23.406 --> 05:26.706
are the most profitable
businesses in the world.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.415
That throughout history,

05:28.578 --> 05:30.751
there's never been
a single shred of evidence

05:30.914 --> 05:33.008
that any of it is real.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.795
Well, I've decided to prove it.

05:36.962 --> 05:39.431
I want to test
the most authentic spells,

05:39.589 --> 05:42.138
rituals, and summonings
that I can find.

05:43.134 --> 05:46.513
I'm only going after the blackest
of the black magic.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.479
The stuff that people
are scared of.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.234
So that when they don't work,

05:51.393 --> 05:53.020
people will pay attention.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.733
And maybe, just maybe,

05:54.896 --> 05:58.776
the world can take a step forward
collectively into reality.

06:01.444 --> 06:04.823
The cameras will be rolling
on me 24/7

06:04.990 --> 06:07.493
in the hopes that
if I uncover anything,

06:07.659 --> 06:09.252
anything at all,

06:09.411 --> 06:13.837
I'll have found the first ever
documented proof.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.427
I'm the testing ground.

06:17.586 --> 06:20.180
Me, Michael King.

06:20.338 --> 06:24.184
So, God or the devil,

06:24.342 --> 06:26.310
if you're out there,

06:26.469 --> 06:27.971
prove it.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.015
Come and get me.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.856
Ladybug, what are you doing?

06:38.023 --> 06:39.650
Why are you up?

06:40.775 --> 06:42.448
I had a scary dream.

06:42.611 --> 06:45.831
Uh-oh. Come here.
What was it about?

06:45.989 --> 06:47.491
A monster.

06:47.657 --> 06:50.206
A monster? Okay.

06:50.368 --> 06:54.623
Well, I wouldn't be surprised
if this particular monster

06:54.789 --> 06:58.009
is a tickle monster.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.340
- (growls )
- ( laughing )

06:59.502 --> 07:00.879
Come on.
Come here, come here.

07:01.046 --> 07:02.639
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.845
See, Fishbone's right.
Old Crowley here...

07:05.008 --> 07:07.408
old Crowley here is the best defense
against tickle monsters.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.805
- Get away! Get away!
- What are you doing?

07:09.971 --> 07:11.131
- Hey, sis.
- What's going on?

07:11.264 --> 07:14.188
Oh, we are...
she had a nightmare.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.773
Yeah, take Crowley with you.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.609
Hey, listen.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.865
Why don't I get in bed with you

07:20.023 --> 07:21.823
and make sure that there are
no more monsters?

07:21.858 --> 07:23.030
- Okay,
- Okay?

07:23.193 --> 07:24.490
I think that's a great idea.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.371
I'm really good
at fending off monsters.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.531
Aunt Beth is the best.
Hey, young lady.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.200
Where do you think you're going?

07:30.367 --> 07:32.745
Are you okay?
All right, give me kisses.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.727
- I love you.
- I love you, too, Dad.

07:35.893 --> 07:37.413
Crowley's gonna
take care of you, okay?

07:37.437 --> 07:38.675
- And Fishbone.
- Okay.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.882
What is all this stuff, Michael?

07:42.045 --> 07:44.548
I mean, you wonder why
she's getting all these nightmares?

07:44.714 --> 07:46.136
Seriously?

07:46.299 --> 07:48.927
It's my new project.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.563
Oh, right.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.064
What?

07:53.223 --> 07:55.396
I thought that you would
be happy, of all people,

07:55.558 --> 07:58.402
to see me, you know, getting back
to work and moving on.

07:59.938 --> 08:02.316
This isn't really
moving on, Michael.

08:04.526 --> 08:07.325
- Well, it is for me.
- Okay.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.955
I'm gonna go put her to bed.

08:09.114 --> 08:11.617
Okay, so last night
I posted an ad.

08:11.783 --> 08:14.582
Documentary filmmaker seeks
proof of the supernatural.

08:14.744 --> 08:18.089
There must be, I don't know,
over 300 hits on this thing already.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.626
We've got Satanists,
voodoo, necromancy.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.419
I even have a priest on here.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.679
I guess that's Los Angeles
for you, right?

08:24.838 --> 08:27.119
We're gonna have no shortage
of material, that's for sure.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.392
Cameraman: What if one of these
fucking Satanists is a serial killer?

08:29.551 --> 08:30.848
- What then?
- Are you serious?

08:31.011 --> 08:33.514
Don't be such a pussy.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.183
So, Father Gibbons,

08:36.349 --> 08:38.727
the Church won't talk
about it publically,

08:38.893 --> 08:41.692
but behind closed doors
you claim

08:41.855 --> 08:43.607
they're performing exorcisms.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.159
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

08:47.318 --> 08:50.288
Okay. And these demons
that they're exercising,

08:50.447 --> 08:52.745
is there any proof
that they're real?

08:52.907 --> 08:54.284
A physical proof?

08:54.451 --> 08:56.954
Like horns and brimstone?

08:57.120 --> 08:59.122
Fire, that kind of thing?

08:59.289 --> 09:01.462
Well, any kind of thing.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.424
I just don't understand
why there's never been

09:03.448 --> 09:05.450
any documented evidence.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.965
What makes you think
there's not?

09:09.132 --> 09:11.055
I haven't seen any.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.719
Well, I mean, of course
you haven't.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.684
You haven't been allowed to.

09:15.680 --> 09:19.560
Okay, listen,
you stated in your e-mail

09:19.726 --> 09:24.448
that you had a real experience,
real proof,

09:24.606 --> 09:27.485
but you don't, do you?

09:27.650 --> 09:29.243
<i>Okay</i> '

09:30.779 --> 09:32.497
When I was 10,

09:32.655 --> 09:34.202
my father...

09:35.283 --> 09:37.411
he started
to take advantage of me.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.248
Every night he would
come into my room...

09:41.414 --> 09:42.836
( bells tolling )

09:42.999 --> 09:45.001
...close the door...

09:48.463 --> 09:50.261
My mother, she must have known.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.676
She prayed all the time.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.970
That was her remedy.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.355
God.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.107
Well, I prayed to God,

09:59.265 --> 10:02.690
but He never stopped
my father, not once.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.776
So I gave up on God.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.446
Started to pray to the devil.
( coughs )

10:10.777 --> 10:12.279
Told him I would do anything

10:12.445 --> 10:14.539
if he'd just make
my father stop.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.877
Well, one night not long after,

10:20.036 --> 10:21.879
in the middle of one
of his visits,

10:22.038 --> 10:25.042
my father had a heart attack.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.461
Died on the spot.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.593
Wow.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.429
That's awful.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.811
I mean, what happened to you,
it's awful.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.517
But come on.

10:38.680 --> 10:43.652
I mean, how is that anything more
than just a strange coincidence?

10:43.810 --> 10:46.689
Well, not long after, I...

10:49.566 --> 10:52.570
began to hear him

10:52.735 --> 10:54.612
calling out to me,

10:54.779 --> 10:56.156
saying things.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.075
I mean, awful, awful things.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.244
The devil?

11:03.204 --> 11:05.127
You hear him...

11:06.791 --> 11:08.589
you don't answer.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.305
Because if you do,
he will know you're listening

11:12.463 --> 11:16.434
and he will never let you go.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.264
Michael:
Hmm.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.273
Right.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.436
Thank you for your time.
Appreciate it.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.700
I ordered a demon summoning kit
off the Internet.

11:32.859 --> 11:37.285
I lit the traditionally
evil-looking black candles.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.449
I even sprung
for the expensive incense

11:39.616 --> 11:42.165
because their Internet site said

11:42.327 --> 11:45.331
that the demons get insulted
by the cheap stuff.

11:46.331 --> 11:50.427
Got one plastic ritual altar.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.303
Nice. Very nice.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.557
And one photocopied booklet.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.685
A lot of money went
into that guy right there, huh?

11:58.843 --> 12:02.063
I also used Ellie's coloring set
to draw my symbols.

12:02.222 --> 12:05.066
Somehow crayons
seemed appropriate.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.943
So basically
what you do is this.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.229
You draw the symbol

12:09.395 --> 12:12.524
for the demon
that you wish to summon.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.192
All right?

12:14.359 --> 12:17.112
You read the spell from this.

12:18.112 --> 12:21.662
Then you light it,

12:21.824 --> 12:23.497
put it in the altar.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.333
Voila.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.543
( French accent ) Instant demon.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.383
Well, surprise, surprise,

12:30.541 --> 12:32.669
the demons were a no-show.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.514
Although...

12:36.673 --> 12:39.643
( groans )
...something's happening.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.977
( Growls )

12:45.139 --> 12:47.141
Okay, there's no demon.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.185
It was worth a shot.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.946
So we got in touch
with a demonologist.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.488
And after negotiating a small...
well, smallish... fee,

12:59.654 --> 13:02.157
we've convinced him
to summon a demon for us.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.325
- ( Knocks )
- Man: Just a sec.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.879
Hi. Michael King.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.960
This is Jordan.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.875
So why do people
always summon demons,

13:12.041 --> 13:13.793
never angels?

13:13.960 --> 13:16.088
People summon angels
all the time.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.847
They just don't want
to interfere.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.680
Now, demons, on the other hand,

13:20.842 --> 13:23.095
they're just dying to come here.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.434
It's most tempting to do that
when we're kind of weak,

13:25.596 --> 13:26.939
out of sorts.

13:27.098 --> 13:29.817
Some people meditate for years
to achieve the proper mind set,

13:29.976 --> 13:33.321
but we use tricks...

13:34.355 --> 13:36.574
to get us there faster.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.740
- Michael: Uh, grape juice?
- With LSD.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.745
How much LSD?

13:41.904 --> 13:43.872
If you're nervous
about this part,

13:44.032 --> 13:46.126
we should stop right now.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.918
There are two prevalent methods
for summoning demons.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.084
The first is by offering
the demon something up front.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.424
A human life,
continued servitude,

13:57.587 --> 13:59.430
your own soul.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.717
I don't recommend those paths

14:01.883 --> 14:04.136
as once performed
they're very hard to undo.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.396
The second method entails
creating the type

14:06.554 --> 14:09.478
of frenetic atmosphere
demons are drawn to...

14:09.640 --> 14:12.268
chaos, blood,

14:12.435 --> 14:15.109
sex, violence.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.898
I'll need some of your essence.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.817
Uh, saliva?

14:18.983 --> 14:20.906
Semen.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.954
( Chuckles )
You're kidding, right?

14:27.450 --> 14:28.793
And I have to get it
in this cup?

14:28.951 --> 14:31.204
- Bathroom's right over there.
- Okay.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.545
Ever hear of auto writing?
Scrying? Psychography?

14:34.707 --> 14:37.210
It's how we're going
to pick your demon,

14:37.377 --> 14:39.345
- the one we're going to summon.
- Okay.

14:39.504 --> 14:41.632
Close your eyes.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.269
Now, clear your mind.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.480
Open yourself up to the beyond.

14:50.848 --> 14:54.728
Allow their energy
to flow through you,

14:54.894 --> 14:57.113
to use you.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.284
Let their energy flow.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.787
Breathe.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.041
Breathe.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.731
I'm sorry, I'm not very susceptible
to this kind of stuff.

15:11.828 --> 15:14.081
- I'm sorry.
- You did just fine.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.682
Just a minute here.

15:24.841 --> 15:27.310
So what are we looking for here?
What's this?

15:27.468 --> 15:29.562
To see if the image
that you drew

15:29.720 --> 15:32.223
matches up
with one of the demons.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.484
And you think that I drew this?

15:34.642 --> 15:36.440
Look.

15:36.602 --> 15:39.071
Daungore.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.278
"Commander of 37 legions.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.819
Seeker of the defenseless,
the weak-spirited,

15:43.985 --> 15:45.737
the nonbeliever.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.281
Known also as the Great Mocker,

15:48.448 --> 15:51.201
Destroyer of Thought,
Breeder of Ants,

15:51.367 --> 15:52.459
Stealer of Children.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.121
He comes accompanied by
the sound of cacophonous music,

15:55.288 --> 15:56.881
staying with the conjurer

15:57.039 --> 15:59.758
until tormentum
in dum demens."

15:59.917 --> 16:02.511
It's Latin for

16:02.670 --> 16:05.594
"torture until madness."

16:09.093 --> 16:11.437
I feel pretty weird, man.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.733
( laughs )
Okay, look at this, man.

16:16.893 --> 16:19.442
This look safe to you?
This is fucked up.

16:19.604 --> 16:22.073
This is fucked up.
Look at all this plastic.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.407
They're gonna kill me in here.
That's what they're gonna do.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.617
Oh, my God.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.998
I'm losing my mind.
This is a bad idea.

16:31.157 --> 16:34.536
This is bad.
Jordan, check this out.

16:37.747 --> 16:40.045
Dude, maybe we should
get the fuck out of here.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.926
Oh, my God, what the fuck
have we gotten ourselves into?

16:51.344 --> 16:54.348
(speaking Latin )

16:59.602 --> 17:02.151
Oh, shit.

17:03.898 --> 17:05.820
These are real.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.611
( Continues speaking Latin )

17:08.778 --> 17:11.076
( laughs )

17:12.073 --> 17:13.825
Satan. Lucifer.

17:17.118 --> 17:19.792
( Continues speaking Latin,
snaps fingers )

17:19.955 --> 17:22.300
Michael: Okay, so what
are you doing here?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.480
Michael:
I'm freaking out a little bit.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.719
( Both speaking Latin )

17:28.881 --> 17:32.181
Michael:
Oh, God. Oh, God.

17:32.343 --> 17:34.971
Jordan? Jordan, what the fuck
is going on, man?

17:35.137 --> 17:37.139
Jordan: Something's
fucking up the camera.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.526
- I can't see shit.
- ( groaning )

17:42.311 --> 17:44.313
( continues speaking Latin )

17:44.480 --> 17:46.027
Jordan:
Hey, hey, hey!

17:46.190 --> 17:48.784
Michael, are you okay?
Are you all right?

17:48.943 --> 17:50.820
Oh, shit.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.740
( Continues speaking Latin )

17:59.829 --> 18:01.331
Jordan:
She's got a knife.

18:02.832 --> 18:05.130
Get that fucking knife
off of him!

18:05.293 --> 18:07.011
- Get it off of him!
- ( shouting )

18:07.169 --> 18:09.467
Jesus Christ!

18:09.630 --> 18:12.509
( Grunting, screaming )

18:40.745 --> 18:44.045
(sighs )

18:48.794 --> 18:50.262
Well...

18:50.421 --> 18:53.300
that was, like, some kind of
satanic porn shoot.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.728
The smell in there, right?

18:58.137 --> 19:00.231
And you paid him.
( laughs )

19:00.389 --> 19:02.892
Come on, man, shh.
Seriously, turn that off.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.989
So you want me
to order you some chili?

19:09.148 --> 19:10.900
Runny eggs?

19:11.067 --> 19:13.035
Or how about a cup
of bloody jizz?

19:13.194 --> 19:15.743
Don't. Don't. Don't.
I'm never eating again.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.492
At least enjoy the acid.
Ready?

19:20.534 --> 19:22.081
You're running through a forest.
You're running through a forest.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.764
Don't, dude. Don't.
Seriously, come on.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.665
I hate you.
Turn it off.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.235
( Screams )

19:53.275 --> 19:57.906
So necromancy is considered
the blackest of the black arts.

19:58.072 --> 19:59.915
Why is that?

20:00.074 --> 20:01.701
Well...

20:03.411 --> 20:07.461
I think it gets most of its bad rap

20:07.623 --> 20:10.718
because of the method employed
in performing it.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.755
You mean dealing with corpses,
graves, funeral rites.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.015
Right, right.
That kind of creeps people out.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.470
Sure.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.806
But as a mortician,

20:19.969 --> 20:21.812
it's all part of my day job.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.729
And as far as the magic goes...

20:27.143 --> 20:28.986
it's really no different

20:29.145 --> 20:31.694
than what any of these
mediums are doing

20:31.856 --> 20:35.326
except we just employ
a slightly different method

20:35.484 --> 20:38.488
in raising the dead.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.291
Teeth taken from
our little friend over there.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.833
Mortician:
A freshly deceased body

20:49.999 --> 20:54.049
works best because the soul
may still be lingering.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.804
Then we can kind of confuse it.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.967
You know, make it think
that it's still alive

20:59.133 --> 21:02.012
and that all it needs to do is just
get back inside of its living body.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.397
<i>Okay.</i>

21:04.555 --> 21:07.354
This is a mild anesthetic

21:07.516 --> 21:10.520
similar to Novocain.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.531
- Okay. Doing all right?
- Yeah.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.947
Okay, it'll start to numb
in just a couple minutes.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.411
The more that we can
make you appear

21:23.574 --> 21:27.169
like that body the soul
once inhabited,

21:27.328 --> 21:29.797
the better our chances.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.500
You feel that?

21:32.666 --> 21:34.384
- No.
- Okay.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.716
Mortician:
The astral corpse,

21:36.879 --> 21:39.177
it wants to keep living.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.718
Living is what it knows.

21:41.884 --> 21:45.058
You know? And unless
it's already grown accustomed

21:45.221 --> 21:48.441
to the afterlife,
it's what's normal.

21:48.599 --> 21:52.320
And it's desperate
to cling on to that.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.950
The Sonoran Desert toad

21:58.108 --> 22:00.861
contains dimethyltryptamine,

22:01.028 --> 22:03.497
or DMT,

22:03.656 --> 22:07.377
the most powerful psychedelic
on the planet.

22:08.369 --> 22:12.090
The human body produces DMT.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.216
It's released when we die.

22:14.375 --> 22:17.174
It helps us pass
to the other side.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.589
But taking it
while we're still living

22:19.755 --> 22:23.259
simulates a near-death
experience.

22:23.425 --> 22:26.269
I'm going to need to let it dry.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.520
Prepare it.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.059
It's gonna take some time.

22:31.225 --> 22:33.273
We need to wait
until it's dark anyhow.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.870
This Novocain is wearing off
on my stomach,

22:39.942 --> 22:42.445
so this is starting to hurt
like a bitch, man.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.623
Oh, there he is.

22:46.782 --> 22:49.410
Hey, sorry we're late.
I got all turned around in here.

22:49.577 --> 22:52.706
Jesus Christ.
Did you kill these...

22:52.872 --> 22:54.294
did you kill these things?

22:54.456 --> 22:56.458
The toads, their pain,

22:56.625 --> 23:00.255
agony, it creates
this sort of energy

23:00.421 --> 23:03.265
that draws in the spirits.

23:03.424 --> 23:05.768
Assume the position.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.394
On your back.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.521
Right.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.024
The smell of burning DMT

23:12.182 --> 23:14.401
can be intensely nauseating.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.235
Like burning plastic.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.402
Now, as it takes effect,

23:23.569 --> 23:25.321
the world will shatter

23:25.487 --> 23:28.331
and your body
will quickly follow.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.834
You may feel like
you're starting to die,

23:30.993 --> 23:33.496
like you don't know
how to breathe at all.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.380
But it's okay.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.507
You just need to let go

23:37.666 --> 23:40.670
- and go with it.
- ( groaning )

23:42.922 --> 23:45.175
To Almighty God

23:45.341 --> 23:48.345
we commend
our brother Michael...

23:49.720 --> 23:52.143
and commit his body
to the ground.

23:52.306 --> 23:55.526
<i>Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.</i>

23:55.684 --> 23:57.903
Roland Sykes.

23:58.062 --> 24:00.235
Roland Sykes,

24:00.397 --> 24:04.072
reclaim your physical body.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.328
- Take this body. Shit!
- ( sirens wail )

24:06.487 --> 24:08.647
- Cop: You, hey!
- Mortician: Get the fuck out of here.

24:08.671 --> 24:10.537
- Cop: Get on your knees!
- Jordan: Michael.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.701
- Where are you?
- Cop #2: They're running.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.253
Oh, fuck me.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.713
( Panting )

24:20.876 --> 24:22.799
Cop: He's making
a break for it. Hey!

24:28.425 --> 24:30.598
- There he goes!
- Jordan: Michael.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.226
( Door squeaks )

24:37.393 --> 24:39.612
Jordan:
Hey, you in here?

24:40.854 --> 24:42.652
Michael, you in here?

24:44.358 --> 24:46.110
Michael.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.507
- Strange voice: Crawl.
- ( Jordan gasps )

25:00.666 --> 25:03.670
- Crawl!
- ( door slams )

25:07.631 --> 25:09.224
( Jordan grunting )

25:09.383 --> 25:11.226
Fuck!

25:16.390 --> 25:18.438
- Crawl.
- Jordan: What is that?

25:18.600 --> 25:20.694
What the fuck is going on here?

25:20.853 --> 25:22.605
Crawl.

25:22.771 --> 25:25.240
Shit. Michael.

25:25.399 --> 25:26.821
Michael.

25:26.984 --> 25:29.032
Come on, get down, man.

25:29.194 --> 25:31.447
Get down from there.
Let's get out of here.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.786
Come on.
Are you okay?

25:36.201 --> 25:39.250
Strange voice:
I don't want to be dead.

25:39.413 --> 25:41.836
- ( Growls)
- Get off, Mike!

25:41.999 --> 25:44.843
- ( Panting )
- Oh, Jesus.

25:48.630 --> 25:50.803
Jordan? Jordan?

25:50.966 --> 25:53.086
Jordan: You're tripping out, man.
It's just the drugs.

25:53.110 --> 25:54.532
Dude, just chill.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.978
Oh, no. No, no.

25:58.140 --> 26:00.689
Fuck. She's gone.

26:00.851 --> 26:02.353
Jordan:
Who's gone?

26:04.021 --> 26:05.819
Sam.

26:05.981 --> 26:08.234
I was with her, man.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.323
I was with Sam.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.284
But she's fucking gone.

26:12.446 --> 26:14.574
Jordan: Come on, let's just get
the fuck out of here.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.500
- Michael: Steal it!
- How did we get so lucky?

26:17.659 --> 26:19.832
- Ellie: Come on!
- Michael: I know, she's amazing.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.838
Fishbone, eh.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.597
He doesn't come
when he's called so much.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.835
- Michael: Yeah.
- Ew, this is gross now, too.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.161
- Here you go. ( gasps )
- No, no, don't give it to me.

26:33.801 --> 26:34.893
( Clears throat )

26:35.052 --> 26:37.396
My wife Samantha was...

26:40.015 --> 26:42.143
I mean, I fucking touched her.

26:42.309 --> 26:45.313
You know, and I felt her with...

26:46.480 --> 26:48.528
( clears throat )

26:48.690 --> 26:50.250
And she was trying
to tell me something.

26:50.359 --> 26:52.703
It was...

26:52.861 --> 26:54.613
there was all this interference.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.657
It was like static.

26:56.824 --> 27:00.419
And I couldn't make out
what she was saying.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.413
But she was...

27:09.837 --> 27:12.636
Took a shower.
Got rid of these fucking teeth.

27:12.798 --> 27:13.970
Look at this.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.013
I feel like I'm still
coming down from the drugs

27:16.037 --> 27:18.346
or something.

27:18.512 --> 27:20.731
And that static sound,

27:20.889 --> 27:23.563
it's, like, still there.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.443
( Sniffles )

27:25.602 --> 27:27.275
I've got to get some sleep.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.358
I can't sleep.
( groans )

27:31.525 --> 27:35.246
Man, it's like 4:30, 5:00.
Something like that.

27:35.404 --> 27:38.248
Sun's gonna be coming up soon.

27:38.407 --> 27:40.205
I'm just past the point.

27:41.785 --> 27:44.504
And that noise, it's, like,

27:44.663 --> 27:47.416
now that I've noticed it, I'm...

27:47.583 --> 27:49.927
I'm fixated on it.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.302
Hey there.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.429
We're at this reading
by Erica Bell.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.842
She's a relatively
well-known medium.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.807
And then afterwards
we get to interview her.

27:58.969 --> 28:00.767
So come on, let's <i>check</i> it out.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.181
( <i>Crowd gasps</i> )

28:02.347 --> 28:04.520
Okay, was there something
with her throat?

28:04.683 --> 28:06.185
Her breathing?

28:06.351 --> 28:08.103
She had esophageal cancer.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.272
She wants you to know
she's okay.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.157
- ( Applause )
- She's watching over you.

28:12.316 --> 28:15.445
And you're...
no, hang on.

28:15.611 --> 28:18.034
No, wait a minute.
Someone else is butting in here.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.665
Lots of spirits
want to talk today.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.541
This is good. Okay.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.122
All right, somewhere over here.

28:23.285 --> 28:26.414
Yes.
Yes, this is a very strong signal.

28:26.580 --> 28:27.957
Female, I think.

28:28.123 --> 28:30.125
She really,
really wants to talk.

28:30.292 --> 28:32.090
Right, she passed recently.

28:32.252 --> 28:34.846
Happened kind of quickly,
an accident maybe.

28:35.005 --> 28:37.303
Okay, she has a message.

28:37.466 --> 28:40.060
No, that can't be right.
She wants to...

28:40.219 --> 28:42.392
Michael, listen to me.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.306
You need to...

28:44.473 --> 28:45.725
( screams )

28:45.891 --> 28:47.859
- Whoa, whoa.
- ( gasping )

28:48.018 --> 28:50.487
Easy, easy, easy.
Jesus Christ.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.695
What happened?
We're not really sure.

28:54.775 --> 28:56.652
Erica was about
to tell us something

28:56.818 --> 28:59.241
and then she went into
that seizure.

29:02.199 --> 29:04.702
I mean, was she actually
channeling Sam?

29:06.370 --> 29:08.873
Or was that just all
part of her show?

29:09.039 --> 29:10.666
And then the seizure

29:10.832 --> 29:13.176
was just like a strange
coincidence or something.

29:13.335 --> 29:14.587
I don't know.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.051
Ellie: Dad, Fishy peed
on the floor again.

29:17.214 --> 29:18.511
Michael:
Huh? Okay, baby.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.674
Daddy will take care of it
after dinner, all right?

29:23.971 --> 29:25.598
- Thanks. Oh, fuck!
- Jeez.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.764
Why the fuck would you
hand me something like that?

29:27.891 --> 29:29.689
It's scalding hot.

29:29.851 --> 29:32.195
God damn it.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.197
Michael, that's a salad.

29:42.281 --> 29:45.000
Um, I'm sorry.
I'm just...

29:45.158 --> 29:46.918
Daddy's a little tense.
I'm sorry about that.

29:47.077 --> 29:50.001
You okay?
I scared you.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.040
( Clears throat )

29:52.207 --> 29:54.630
You Okay?

29:54.793 --> 29:56.795
Yeah.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.886
Have some salad, Ellie.

30:09.391 --> 30:10.984
(sighs )

30:15.772 --> 30:17.570
(sighs )

30:20.694 --> 30:23.243
I thought if I went out today

30:23.405 --> 30:26.454
that I could shake
this noise in my head,

30:26.616 --> 30:28.710
that it would just go away.

30:28.869 --> 30:30.997
( Groans )

30:31.163 --> 30:33.382
( <i>Cracks</i> )

30:35.042 --> 30:37.886
But now that I'm home
and it's quiet, it's like...

30:38.045 --> 30:40.218
( <i>Cracks</i> )

30:41.590 --> 30:43.592
I wish I could describe for you

30:43.759 --> 30:45.386
what this is.

30:45.552 --> 30:48.431
It's this constant barrage,

30:48.597 --> 30:50.645
this cacophony of sound.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.275
It's like...

30:53.560 --> 30:55.938
it's like...
( roars )

31:04.196 --> 31:06.324
( gasps )

31:07.908 --> 31:10.081
Oh, fuck.

31:10.243 --> 31:12.996
- ( Roaring )
<i>'</i> ( digital squealing )

31:19.378 --> 31:21.881
Okay, so what's the deal again?

31:22.047 --> 31:25.301
Like I said,
it came out of my mouth.

31:25.467 --> 31:27.970
Uh-huh. Yeah, no.

31:28.136 --> 31:29.638
Why not?

31:29.805 --> 31:32.729
There's multiple layers
of overtone singing.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.438
Overtone?
What does that mean?

31:34.601 --> 31:36.241
It's when a singer
manipulates their voice

31:36.407 --> 31:38.159
to have multiple pitches
at the same time.

31:38.326 --> 31:41.158
Okay, good.
So then maybe I did it accidentally.

31:41.316 --> 31:45.696
Well, even if I bought that,
which I don't, there's more.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.160
Here. Let's see.

31:48.323 --> 31:50.325
- This is a B2.
- ( note plays )

31:50.492 --> 31:53.371
- Okay.
- And this is a C# 7.

31:53.537 --> 31:55.414
( Note plays )

31:55.580 --> 31:58.049
That's a Guinness Book
vocal range right there.

31:58.208 --> 32:00.085
The tape you gave me...

32:00.252 --> 32:01.925
( note playing )

32:02.087 --> 32:04.089
...we're talking F #

32:04.256 --> 32:05.849
all the way...

32:08.969 --> 32:12.519
- E25.
- ( high-pitched note )

32:13.890 --> 32:15.358
Some of it's not even audible.

32:15.517 --> 32:17.144
Just barely registering
on my stuff.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.233
Let me ask you this.
Is it possible

32:19.396 --> 32:21.569
that my vocal cords
could have made this?

32:21.731 --> 32:23.699
Not a chance.

32:23.859 --> 32:25.452
If you're not fucking with me,

32:25.610 --> 32:27.930
then there's something wrong
with the audio in your camera.

32:27.954 --> 32:29.281
A defect or something.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.917
It's not the camera.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.952
Thanks.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.121
( Loud static hissing )

32:38.540 --> 32:40.087
Beth:
Michael.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.298
Michael.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.805
- ( Turns off static )
- So fricking loud.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.475
Michael?

32:48.633 --> 32:50.852
Hello?

32:51.011 --> 32:54.060
What are you doing?
Hey. Michael.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.724
- ( Growls )
- ( gasps )

32:55.891 --> 32:58.394
Oh, my God.
You scared me.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.312
Let's go.
I've been calling you.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.106
Dinner's ready.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.839
- ( Loud static hissing )
- ( high-frequency whining )

33:28.298 --> 33:31.302
( growling )

33:58.995 --> 34:01.464
( growling continues )

34:12.634 --> 34:14.806
( Fishbone barking )

34:19.349 --> 34:22.101
( Michael growling )

34:24.646 --> 34:26.239
Chronic ringing of the ears.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.775
It's a very common condition.
It's called tinnitus.

34:28.942 --> 34:31.866
- You should see an internist.
- I did. I did.

34:32.027 --> 34:33.871
He gave me
a clean bill of health.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.532
Said that it must be
psychosomatic,

34:35.699 --> 34:38.543
that I should see a psychiatrist,
which is why I'm here.

34:40.161 --> 34:43.040
I understand, Michael,
that your wife died recently.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.174
Six months ago, yeah.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.051
Left you alone
with a little girl.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.963
( Clears throat )
Ellie, uh-huh.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.382
You might be going through
some extreme stress

34:52.549 --> 34:55.678
trying to deal with thoughts,
feelings, emotions,

34:55.844 --> 34:59.394
things that consciously you might
not think you can handle.

34:59.556 --> 35:02.480
And so then they become
side effects.

35:02.642 --> 35:06.192
All right, so you think you can,
I don't know,

35:06.354 --> 35:09.324
help me come to grips with this
if that's what it is?

35:09.482 --> 35:11.484
Doctor:
Breathe.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.153
Good.

35:14.571 --> 35:17.541
Let your thoughts,
your conscious,

35:17.699 --> 35:19.918
drift away.

35:20.076 --> 35:22.670
Nice and easy.

35:23.663 --> 35:27.133
We're traveling deep
into your subconscious, Michael.

35:27.292 --> 35:30.045
Deep down inside.

35:31.171 --> 35:33.390
- ( Gasps )
- Michael?

35:33.548 --> 35:35.721
Are you there?
Are you with me?

35:38.053 --> 35:39.896
Michael: Yes.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.728
Doctor:
How are you feeling?

35:41.890 --> 35:44.143
- Michael: Fine.
- Doctor: Good.

35:44.309 --> 35:47.688
That sound in your head,
is it still there?

35:47.854 --> 35:49.401
Michael: Yes.

35:49.564 --> 35:52.864
- Okay.
- But there's something else.

35:53.026 --> 35:54.903
Doctor:
What?

35:55.070 --> 35:57.289
Michael:
I know what the sound is.

35:57.447 --> 35:59.199
Doctor:
What is it, Michael?

35:59.366 --> 36:00.959
Michael:
Voices.

36:01.117 --> 36:04.041
- Voices?
- Yes.

36:04.204 --> 36:06.332
What are they saying?

36:08.041 --> 36:09.918
So many things.

36:10.085 --> 36:12.087
Doctor:
Anything in particular?

36:12.253 --> 36:14.927
- Yes.
- What?

36:15.090 --> 36:18.765
They're saying you will...

36:18.927 --> 36:21.771
Doctor: What?
You will what, Michael?

36:21.930 --> 36:23.728
( Strange voices whispering )

36:23.890 --> 36:25.688
Michael:
You will...

36:27.310 --> 36:29.028
Doctor:
Michael?

36:30.355 --> 36:32.357
Strange voice:
Crawl.

36:33.441 --> 36:34.943
Jordan:
Michael, are you okay?

36:35.110 --> 36:36.327
Michael.

36:36.486 --> 36:38.454
Hey!
What the fuck?

36:38.613 --> 36:40.536
What the fuck is going on?

36:44.869 --> 36:47.622
The camera jumped
out of my hands.

36:47.789 --> 36:50.508
You made some weird voice.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.840
( laughs ) Bullshit.

36:53.002 --> 36:54.800
It's all on the camera.

36:54.963 --> 36:58.433
And then you were talking about
all the sounds in your head,

36:58.591 --> 37:00.969
they were voices.

37:03.263 --> 37:06.733
Look, I know this is none
of my business, but...

37:07.726 --> 37:10.730
you think Sam would want you
to be doing this?

37:15.984 --> 37:20.034
So Jordan officially
left the project.

37:20.196 --> 37:22.415
Is something really
happening to me?

37:22.574 --> 37:24.372
I mean,
I'm physically exhausted.

37:24.534 --> 37:26.787
I'm drained.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.830
And I was hypnotized, you know?

37:28.997 --> 37:33.594
Is it really that surprising
that I spoke in some weird voice?

37:33.752 --> 37:36.972
I mean, I think that Jordan just got
startled and threw the camera.

37:37.964 --> 37:39.841
That's what it looked like.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.844
I don't know.

37:45.054 --> 37:47.182
( Groans )

37:47.348 --> 37:49.146
Okay, I'm back.

37:49.309 --> 37:51.107
And this thing
going on in my head,

37:51.269 --> 37:54.364
it's evolving.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.113
It's like I can hear this...

37:58.276 --> 38:00.495
mumbling now.

38:00.653 --> 38:03.907
<i>Like my subconscious</i>

38:04.073 --> 38:05.916
is trying to talk to me
or something.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.289
And if I concentrate...

38:14.042 --> 38:16.295
I can almost tell
what it's saying.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.512
( Crashes )

38:31.476 --> 38:33.524
Must have flown into the window.

38:33.686 --> 38:35.063
Doll:
Crowley loves you.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.903
( Caws, cackles )

38:37.065 --> 38:40.035
Hey, sweetie.
Did that noise wake you up?

38:40.193 --> 38:42.491
That was just the window.
It broke.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.782
It was just the window.
It's okay.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.418
What is it?
You all right?

38:48.576 --> 38:51.546
- The monster.
- Monster?

38:52.914 --> 38:54.757
Oh, from your dream.

38:56.543 --> 38:59.592
Okay. Okay.
Let's see.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.802
I'll tell you what.

39:01.965 --> 39:04.184
How about you go back to sleep,

39:04.342 --> 39:06.595
and then maybe Daddy
will show up in your dream

39:06.761 --> 39:08.354
and then he can chase
that monster away.

39:08.513 --> 39:10.015
How's that?

39:10.181 --> 39:12.024
You can't.

39:13.393 --> 39:15.612
Really?
Why is that?

39:15.770 --> 39:17.772
I saw the monster.

39:17.939 --> 39:19.361
Well, that's good.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.492
What did this monster look like?

39:22.527 --> 39:24.450
It's you, Daddy.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.040
It's me?

39:32.120 --> 39:34.794
It's just a bad dream.
You know that, right?

39:34.956 --> 39:37.584
And Daddy would never
hurt you, okay?

39:37.750 --> 39:39.798
No matter what.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.849
Why don't you go get Fishbone

39:45.008 --> 39:47.431
and go get back in bed, okay?

39:47.594 --> 39:49.267
I can't find her.

39:49.429 --> 39:50.806
Michael:
Come on, girl.

39:50.972 --> 39:52.519
(whistles )

39:54.517 --> 39:56.565
What you doing, Fishy?

40:01.566 --> 40:04.695
Let's see, that bird should be
right about here.

40:04.861 --> 40:07.785
Huh. That's weird.

40:11.993 --> 40:13.711
Fishbone.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.256
Is that you, girl?

40:18.458 --> 40:19.880
(whistles )

40:20.043 --> 40:22.171
Oh, where the fuck are you?

40:22.337 --> 40:24.510
( Trash cans rattle )

40:29.969 --> 40:32.518
( crunching )

40:32.680 --> 40:35.024
What the fuck?

40:40.688 --> 40:43.407
Whoa, Jesus Christ!

40:45.693 --> 40:47.741
Fuck.

40:49.781 --> 40:52.034
What the fuck is that?

40:52.200 --> 40:54.202
Ellie! Beth!

40:55.203 --> 40:57.376
Ellie! Beth!

41:00.083 --> 41:02.802
Jesus. Michael.
What the hell?

41:05.380 --> 41:06.927
What are you doing?
She's asleep.

41:07.090 --> 41:09.343
What are you doing?

41:09.509 --> 41:11.511
Michael, what is wrong?

41:11.678 --> 41:13.055
We'll find the dog, okay?

41:13.221 --> 41:15.770
Just relax.

41:15.932 --> 41:19.402
Look, will you please
stop acting like this?

41:22.438 --> 41:24.987
I'm sorry.
I'm just...

41:25.149 --> 41:28.278
You're just acting,
like, crazy, so...

41:31.072 --> 41:32.745
- You all right?
- Are you all right?

41:36.452 --> 41:37.920
- Yeah.
- You look like shit.

41:38.079 --> 41:39.422
Have you slept lately?

41:39.580 --> 41:41.753
( Sighs ) Oh, God.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.720
I just can't seem to wind down.

41:45.878 --> 41:47.755
Hold on.

41:50.091 --> 41:52.219
Here.
Take two of these.

41:52.385 --> 41:54.387
- Sleeping pills?
- Yup.

41:54.554 --> 41:56.522
Then you will sleep, believe me.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.775
Feel better in the morning.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.061
Thank you.
Good night.

42:02.603 --> 42:04.731
( Static hissing )

( rattles )

44:22.451 --> 44:24.419
( Beth moans )

44:28.082 --> 44:30.460
Michael: I thought if I got
a good night's sleep

44:30.626 --> 44:33.550
that this would end.

44:33.713 --> 44:37.217
But these voices,
they're not going away.

44:38.551 --> 44:40.645
I need to confront this.

44:54.317 --> 44:55.944
So...

44:58.446 --> 45:00.289
are you real?

45:02.033 --> 45:03.876
Or am I going insane?

45:08.497 --> 45:10.966
Neither is an appealing
choice, but...

45:12.585 --> 45:15.134
I suppose one of them
must be true.

45:18.007 --> 45:20.180
I guess I'd rather...

45:22.803 --> 45:24.931
you were real.

45:31.854 --> 45:34.277
( <i>Cracks</i> )

45:42.865 --> 45:46.210
Okay. Okay.
What if...

45:46.369 --> 45:48.121
what if I said...

45:49.622 --> 45:52.125
what if I said that you've proved
your existence?

45:54.043 --> 45:56.011
That I believed in you?

45:57.421 --> 45:59.515
I believe in you.

46:01.592 --> 46:03.970
Would you just...

46:04.136 --> 46:06.059
would you leave?

46:17.483 --> 46:19.577
Strange voice:
No.

( Growling )

46:25.950 --> 46:28.624

46:38.421 --> 46:41.470
Hi.
Oh, is Father Gibbons here?

46:41.632 --> 46:43.134
I'm sorry, no.

46:43.301 --> 46:45.099
Strange voice:
Kill her.

46:46.387 --> 46:48.981
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Listen, it is urgent.

46:49.140 --> 46:50.860
I need to speak
to Father Gibbons right now.

46:50.884 --> 46:52.244
- And you are?
- Just get Father...

46:52.393 --> 46:53.770
I'm Michael King.
I'm Michael King.

46:53.936 --> 46:55.456
I interviewed him
and I need to talk...

46:55.521 --> 46:57.601
- I need to talk to him right...
- Priest: I'm sorry.

46:57.625 --> 46:59.073
Father Gibbons passed
a few days ago.

46:59.191 --> 47:01.785
He's... he's... okay.

47:01.944 --> 47:03.446
Listen, I need an exorcism.

47:03.612 --> 47:04.784
- An exorcism?
- Yeah.

47:04.947 --> 47:07.416
- The Church doesn't do that.
- No, you do it.

47:07.575 --> 47:09.535
I know you do.
Father Gibbons told me that you do.

47:09.660 --> 47:11.082
I need an exorcism, please.

47:11.245 --> 47:13.873
He was rather out of sorts
towards the end.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.587
I'm sorry if he misled you.

47:15.750 --> 47:17.218
He didn't mislead me.
I need help.

47:17.376 --> 47:19.344
Excuse me.
There's nothing we can do for you.

47:19.503 --> 47:21.663
- Sorry, we can't help you.
- Father, I need your help.

47:21.797 --> 47:23.765
- I'm sorry.
- Oh.

47:23.924 --> 47:26.097
Okay. Okay.

47:27.470 --> 47:29.438
( Screams )

47:30.848 --> 47:33.317
Excuse me a moment.

47:33.476 --> 47:35.979
- You can't come here.
- How do I get rid of it?

47:36.145 --> 47:38.385
- How do I make it go away?
- What are you talking about?

47:38.481 --> 47:41.155
I mean this thing.
This thing in my fucking head.

47:41.317 --> 47:43.160
I warned you something
like this might happen.

47:43.319 --> 47:45.947
Now I need you
to get the fuck out.

Hey.

48:00.336 --> 48:01.883
What the fuck
have you done to me?

48:02.046 --> 48:05.175
- What is this thing?
- What? I don't understand.

48:05.341 --> 48:07.560
Something's got a hold of me.
You did something.

48:07.718 --> 48:09.878
- You summoned something.
- No, man, it's not for real.

48:09.970 --> 48:11.730
- It's all for fun.
- Bullshit, you're lying.

Please help me.

48:18.771 --> 48:22.446
- Now get out of here.
- Please. I need your help.

48:22.608 --> 48:24.201
I really need to talk to her.

48:24.360 --> 48:26.988
I need to come in
and I need to see her.

48:27.154 --> 48:28.714
But isn't that
what she's supposed to do

48:28.738 --> 48:31.000
is help somebody that's in
a situation like what I'm in?

48:31.158 --> 48:33.331
I'm hearing shit
and I'm seeing shit now.

48:33.494 --> 48:35.292
Listen, I'm losing
my fucking mind.

48:35.454 --> 48:38.048
Would you please just tell Dr. Cox
that I need to talk to her?

48:38.207 --> 48:40.710
Can you do that for me?
Oh!

48:40.876 --> 48:43.095
You don't know how
fucking desperate I am here, okay?

48:43.254 --> 48:46.383
You're supposed to help people.
Well, I need your fucking help!

48:52.555 --> 48:54.728
I don't know what to fucking do.

do you miss your mommy?

50:01.957 --> 50:03.925

Hey, Ellie, come on.

these crazy thoughts.

"Turn back this evil
upon my soul.

55:21.401 --> 55:24.245
I beseech you, Lord.
I beseech you."

55:25.405 --> 55:28.500
Strange voice:
Burn! Burn!

55:28.659 --> 55:31.128
- Burn!
- Fuck! God damn it!

55:31.286 --> 55:34.335
You can't have this body.

55:34.498 --> 55:36.546
No! No, God damn it!

55:38.460 --> 55:41.760
(groaning )

55:41.922 --> 55:44.801
Fuck! Fuck!

55:44.967 --> 55:47.311
( Screams )

55:49.805 --> 55:52.479
God, please!

55:52.641 --> 55:56.020
- ( Screaming )
- ( voice gibbering )

55:59.231 --> 56:01.325
- ( glass shatters )
- ( cacophony stops )

56:55.704 --> 56:58.127
I've tried everything.

56:58.290 --> 57:01.669
Protective spells, banishments,

57:01.835 --> 57:05.214
charms,
every incantation I can find.

57:06.673 --> 57:08.516
Nothing's worked.

57:08.675 --> 57:12.851
The more I try and fight it,
the more it takes over.

57:14.389 --> 57:16.562
Forcing me to do things.

57:18.644 --> 57:21.238
Laughing at me.

57:21.396 --> 57:23.649
It's fucking laughing at me.

57:30.113 --> 57:33.242
You'd think
this really hurts, right?

57:35.077 --> 57:37.045
Funny thing is

57:37.204 --> 57:39.172
I can hardly feel it.

57:41.124 --> 57:45.254
It's getting harder and harder
to feel anything.

57:47.589 --> 57:49.591
It's like...

57:51.426 --> 57:53.724
none of this is real anymore.

57:56.431 --> 57:59.401
( laughs )

58:00.644 --> 58:03.944
It's not real.
( laughing )

58:16.118 --> 58:17.961
Nothing is real.

58:31.425 --> 58:32.927
See this?

58:35.637 --> 58:37.184
Look at that.

58:41.935 --> 58:44.279
No matter
how many times I kill it...

58:45.522 --> 58:47.399
ah, there.

58:51.403 --> 58:53.656
Oh, yeah.
See this? See?

58:53.822 --> 58:56.917
Another one. Okay.

58:59.703 --> 59:02.547
I've been doing this
all day long.

59:02.706 --> 59:04.674
Look at that bastard.

59:04.833 --> 59:07.177
You son of a bitch.

59:07.335 --> 59:09.087
Fuck. Another one.

59:10.672 --> 59:12.015
God damn it.

59:16.636 --> 59:20.357
If I let it crawl on my body,
there's only one.

59:21.683 --> 59:24.152
The second I kill it,

59:24.311 --> 59:26.530
another one shows up.

59:29.441 --> 59:33.071
- ( Voice whispers ) The girl.
- ( winces )

59:33.236 --> 59:35.409
I know, okay?
I know what you want!

59:35.572 --> 59:38.451
(voice whispering )
We want the girl.

59:39.868 --> 59:42.121
- You can't have her.
- We can make you do it.

59:42.287 --> 59:44.415
- You can't have her.
- Someone else.

59:44.581 --> 59:47.380
- Someone else.
- Okay. Okay.

59:47.542 --> 59:51.046
I'll do it. I'll do it.

59:51.213 --> 59:52.886
But you can't have Ellie.

59:53.048 --> 59:54.800
You hear me?

59:54.966 --> 59:57.344
You can't have Ellie.

01:00:06.895 --> 01:00:09.114
( Strange voices whispering )

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:12.276
( dog barking )

01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:26.164
( strange voices whispering )

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.739
( knife scraping )

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:55.944
(voice whispering )
Kill her. Now. Kill her.

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:58.284
Kill her. Kill her.

01:00:58.446 --> 01:01:01.120
- ( Groans )
- Kill her!

01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:06.838
We want you to kill her.

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:10.092
( Growling )

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:22.813
Kill.

01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:24.814
Kill him.

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:33.107
( Door closes )

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.655
(sighs )

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:46.832
Sorry, Ellie.

01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:49.498
I just... I couldn't do it.

01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:51.166
I just...

01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:55.546
I have to fucking
get some sleep.

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:57.714
Goddamn rest.

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:01.009
You're not going anywhere!

01:02:01.176 --> 01:02:02.849
Okay, we're not going anywhere.

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:04.888
We're fuckin' sleeping.

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:07.558
No, we're not going out.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:10.694
( Strange voices whispering )

01:02:13.355 --> 01:02:16.780
- ( screams )
- Yes, you will!

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.158
( Screams )

01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:26.918
(groaning )

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:50.316
( growls )

01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:09.165
What the fuck?

01:03:16.001 --> 01:03:17.924
Oh, no.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.922
( Distant static hissing )

01:03:34.102 --> 01:03:36.275
( static hissing )

01:03:53.455 --> 01:03:54.923
Jordan:
Michael.

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:57.755
- Jordan, I'm in here.
- Michael?

01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:01.554
- Michael.
- Yeah.

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:04.341
Jesus Christ, what the fuck
is going on in here?

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.976
Your place is a dis... Jesus.

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:15.485
Key is over there.
Do you mind getting it for me?

01:04:15.643 --> 01:04:18.317
Oh, fuck.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.905
We need to get you
some serious help, all right?

01:04:22.067 --> 01:04:25.446
You gonna check into a facility?

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:27.410
I'm serious, man.
If I unlock you,

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:30.496
we are going there right now.

01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:35.038
Answer the fucking...
what am I doing?

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:37.173
( Phone ringing )

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:45.890
Jordan?

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:50.187
( Phone continues ringing )

01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:06.111
(stops ringing )

01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:15.545
Oh! Oh, fuck!

01:05:15.703 --> 01:05:18.252
There was a being

01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:21.009
inside a light and...

01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:25.464
I don't know
if it was an angel or...

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:28.133
( chuckles ) God.

01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:34.898
It asked me if I was
prepared to move on.

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:41.526
All I needed to do was let go.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.411
And I wanted to.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:53.625
But I held on because

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:56.036
I needed to come back
and tell you

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:59.456
that everything
was gonna be okay,

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:01.624
that I'm okay.

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:06.755
Because...

01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:09.803
the next time that it happens,

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:13.140
I'm gonna let go.

01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:19.192
Michael, I know you have
a hard time believing...

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:21.148
( sobbing )

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:24.155
...but it's real.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.487
I know that now.

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:31.371
I love you, Michael.

01:06:31.529 --> 01:06:33.452
I always will.

01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:38.212
There's a few things
I need to say to Ellie.

01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:41.339
Why the fuck
didn't I listen to you?

01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:44.172
My little ladybug.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:47.053
So sad I'm not gonna
see you grow up

01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:49.840
- into the beautiful...
- Fuck!

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:54.056
...stunning little angel
you already are.

01:06:55.053 --> 01:06:57.173
- Please just know that I'm with you.
- No! You can't.

01:06:57.339 --> 01:06:59.512
- I'm always there.
- You can't have this body.

01:06:59.675 --> 01:07:01.480
It'll be okay.

01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:03.645
It's gonna be okay.

01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:07.903
( Groans ) Kill me!

01:07:08.066 --> 01:07:09.909
(groaning )

01:07:10.068 --> 01:07:12.662
Fuck.
Here we go.

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:20.166
( Screaming )

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:27.419
(water running )

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:49.073
These cameras,

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:50.950
this film...

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:54.704
it's proof.

01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:58.537
I hope someone finds it

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:01.294
and uses it to show others.

01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:05.499
Tell my story, please.

01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:08.214
Someone tell my story.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:14.724
Tell my daughter...

01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:17.385
tell my daughter

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:20.225
her daddy never meant
for any of this to happen.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.899
Tell her that...
tell her that Daddy loves her.

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:28.692
( Coughs )

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:31.028
Tell her... tell her
her daddy loves...

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:35.403
- ( groans )
- ( strange voices whispering )

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:39.575
Strange voice:
You ought to kill her.

01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:42.665
- No. No.
- Do it.

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:45.250
No! Leave me alone.

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:48.633
Why?
We're having fun.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.294
( Gags )

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:53.589
(voice laughing )

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:11.027
( water splashes )

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:13.442
- ( screams )
- ( electricity crackles )

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.453
I love you.

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:22.037
Okay, now go..

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.240
Michael: Fishy, what are you doing?
Get out of that.

01:09:24.264 --> 01:09:26.670
- That's not yours.
- Oh, no, he ate all the popcorn.

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:28.957
- Baby. Come here.
- That dog is like a disposal.

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:32.343
Now puke. Puke.
Give it back.

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:34.142
Michael: Put your fingers
down his throat.

01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:35.841
Mouth to mouth.

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:42.429
( Music box playing )

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.973
( raspy breathing )

01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:53.691
Strange voice:
We're together now, Michael.

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:56.359
Isn't it wonderful?

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:59.951
I had it wrong, didn't I?

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:11.250
The interference,
the chattering,

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:13.043
the noise...

01:10:14.836 --> 01:10:16.509
those weren't demons.

01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:18.173
That wasn't you.

01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:22.469
(voice laughing )

01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:26.397
Those were angels.

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:28.809
Something.

01:10:29.934 --> 01:10:31.686
Trying to...

01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:34.231
trying to warn me.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:37.025
(voice laughs )

01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:40.695
Trying to keep me from hearing

01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:42.956
the real voices...

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:45.704
the real singing.

01:10:51.205 --> 01:10:55.176
Because once you hear it,

01:10:55.334 --> 01:10:58.383
you can never stop listening.

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:05.303
(voice laughing )

01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:08.019

( static hissing )

01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:52.434
Ellie: I'm gonna go
get Crowley.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.398
Michael?

01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:58.819
Oh, my God.
What the...?

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:00.483
- ( Door slams )
- ( gasps ) Michael.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:02.573
- Michael, you're scaring me.
- ( growling )

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:04.829
Michael, it's me.
It's Beth. Please.

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:07.081
( Choking )

01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:17.125
( choking )

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:20.469
( snaps )

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:28.557
( laughs )

01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:31.017
Daddy?

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.773
Strange voice:
Let's play.

01:12:32.932 --> 01:12:35.526
( Groans ) No.

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:38.689
Ellie, run.

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:41.825
Run from Daddy.
Go.

01:12:41.983 --> 01:12:45.328
Strange voice:
Ellie, I'm coming to get you.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.537
(groaning )

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:50.701
Strange voice:
We're gonna rip her head off.

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:52.494
No.

01:12:53.744 --> 01:12:55.997
Run, Ellie. Go.

01:12:56.163 --> 01:12:59.463
Strange voice:
We're gonna eat her, Michael.

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:04.259
( Bones cracking )

01:13:16.851 --> 01:13:19.024
( groans )

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:21.860
( cracking )

Where are you hiding, ladybug?

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:43.336
( Growls )

Doll:
Crowley loves you.

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:46.054
( Caws )

01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:50.598
No. No.

01:13:59.894 --> 01:14:03.239
- Ellie.
- ( growling )

Go quickly.

What is your New Year's
resolution?

To make a documentary
about this family

01:15:52.423 --> 01:15:53.845
so that I can show
the whole world

01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:55.601
what a lucky guy I am.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.683

If only you believed in God.

01:16:01.432 --> 01:16:03.025
Yeah, that'd probably help
a little bit.

01:16:03.184 --> 01:16:04.481
Oh, crap.
You know what?

01:16:04.643 --> 01:16:07.003
I didn't put change in that meter.
We're gonna get a ticket.
