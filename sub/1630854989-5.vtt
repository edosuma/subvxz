WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:04.600
The following programme contains
strong language and violent scenes.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.680
If we're gonna do this,

00:16.680 --> 00:18.320
let's go all the way.

00:18.320 --> 00:20.640
Empower your boys.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.480
Make them feel valuable.

00:22.480 --> 00:25.760
Swallow.
Grandad, watch this.

00:25.760 --> 00:29.040
Oh!
He's inherited your skills.

00:29.880 --> 00:31.320
And yours.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.840
This Cesar fella?
The Mayor?

00:34.840 --> 00:37.240
If he's the man down here,
and we wanna build stuff,

00:37.240 --> 00:39.360
then we've gotta get him onside.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.560
There's blood on them readies.
- For you.
- Good boy.

00:43.680 --> 00:46.320
Go and check on your brother,
will you?

00:46.320 --> 00:48.200
The land belongs to my family now.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.320
If you want a safe
passage for your hash,

00:50.320 --> 00:52.040
I'm the only one
that can make that happen.

00:52.040 --> 00:54.120
And what do you get out of this?

00:54.120 --> 00:56.640
An opportunity to meet
your people in Africa.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.280
There is something you might
wanna know

00:58.280 --> 01:00.400
about Gene's deal with the Gitanos.

01:00.400 --> 01:01.960
He's got a plane to Morocco.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.320
He's meeting
some drug dealers there.

01:04.320 --> 01:07.600
Nothing there but desert.
And oranges.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.760
Tomorrow, I leave for Tangiers.
If it really can't wait,

01:10.760 --> 01:12.840
I'm contactable here in Morocco.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.960
And Mr Lord,
don't ever try to buy me again.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.840
Please Eddie, just go!

01:18.720 --> 01:20.640
I have to be able to trust you.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.360
You can.
My baby boy.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.240
You've come back.

01:25.240 --> 01:27.880
You think I'm ashamed?
You couldn't wait to get shot of me.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.520
That's because
it's not safe for you here.

01:30.520 --> 01:32.760
Then why the fuck
are you still here?

04:02.480 --> 04:04.360
Hey!

04:05.240 --> 04:08.040
Trying to hide from us?
I haven't been paid yet.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.320
Paid by who? If you had a job,
we wouldn't be here, would we?

04:12.760 --> 04:15.320
I've got interviews, I swear. Yeah.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.600
Yeah.
What's this?

04:18.800 --> 04:21.320
It's a yam. Yam.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.600
You heard Dad, it's a yam.

04:27.720 --> 04:31.880
Please, Mr Lord. One more week.
I'll get your money.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.800
What you do? Spunk your money
on rum and wacky-baccy?

04:34.800 --> 04:36.960
Fucking waster.

04:36.960 --> 04:40.520
If we was alone,
I'd fucking wipe the floor with you.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.840
You wouldn't dare step foot
in here alone, boy.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.800
Anything valuable in there?
Please.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.000
Look, it's a mess in there.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.160
Ugh.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.200
Not so fucking hard now, are ya?
Ugh!

05:17.760 --> 05:19.920
This fucking gaff's a shit-hole, Dad.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.360
No need to ridicule
a man's living quarters.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.440
We all got to start somewhere.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.160
Which is why...

05:27.760 --> 05:30.440
...we're happy
to provide the service we do.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.280
Give people like you a chance
to make something of themselves.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.360
Like what we did.

05:38.040 --> 05:40.720
But do not misconstrue
my kindness for weakness.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.920
Friday. With interest.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.240
Or we'll have to find
another way for you to pay.

05:50.640 --> 05:53.480
Tick tock. The meter's running.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.400
Here you are, ma'am.
Room for one more?

05:57.400 --> 05:59.280
Leave me alone!
We ain't done nothing.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.880
What the fuck were you thinking,
bringing criminals into our home?!

06:02.880 --> 06:06.200
We needed food, clothes for Eddie,
a suit for my inter-A suit?!

06:06.200 --> 06:08.240
I wasn't getting anywhere.
It's nothing to do

06:08.240 --> 06:10.440
with what you're wearing!
Look, I'm trying to change

06:10.440 --> 06:13.640
the way that people see me.
A suit isn't gonna do that!

06:25.080 --> 06:26.640
Who are they?

06:29.160 --> 06:30.920
The Lords.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.360
They run things round Bermondsey

06:35.800 --> 06:38.440
protection, money-lending-

06:38.440 --> 06:41.120
Why pay into a pardna if you're
just gonna go to gangsters?

06:41.120 --> 06:42.840
Our draw's three months away.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.360
I didn't want you to miss
the deadline for college.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.400
How dangerous are they?

07:06.360 --> 07:07.920
He's OK.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.400
That's why you hid us, isn't it?

07:11.520 --> 07:16.600
Relax, alright? I'll find something.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.240
Even if it means going back
to the building site.

07:20.360 --> 07:23.960
I'll pay him back and...
and then we can start saving...

07:25.000 --> 07:27.640
...laying down roots, the...
the community centre.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.120
And then start one up in Jamaica,
so that youngsters

07:31.120 --> 07:34.160
can come back and forth,
prosperity for all.

07:37.920 --> 07:41.680
It's a lovely dream.
But we have to be realistic.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.800
Yeah, I know, and...

07:43.800 --> 07:46.080
I'll make it right, I promise.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.640
Mercy?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.840
Interview didn't go well, then?

08:06.600 --> 08:08.880
You said there were
other ways to pay.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.680
And there are.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.440
And as our dad says...

08:13.280 --> 08:17.040
...don't confuse
our kindness with weakness.

08:22.840 --> 08:26.760
Me, my brothers, we stick
out round here like sore thumbs.

08:26.760 --> 08:30.920
But you,
you can get to places we can't.

08:30.920 --> 08:32.880
Places like that.

08:35.760 --> 08:39.640
There's another fella,
name of Bunny.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.880
About your stamp. You know him?

08:47.400 --> 08:49.080
He's just gone in.

08:51.160 --> 08:53.360
I can't.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.240
You need to send a message. Tonight.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.480
Or else you'll end up
being a message.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.320

12:55.800 --> 12:57.880

13:07.480 --> 13:10.120
We're completely fucking potless.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.680
Yeah, they won't take us seriously
without a down payment dad.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.200
Relax boy,
you're only buying oranges.

13:15.200 --> 13:18.360
You can blag a couple of Arab
greengrocers, can't you?

13:18.360 --> 13:21.280
Oh, come on you two, use your charm.
You know you've got plenty of it.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.240

Look, it's your contract, alright.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.600

You be careful with them
people over there.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.560
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, you too, alright.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.920
Do you think my
dad knows what we are up too?

13:56.200 --> 13:58.760
I'll keep an eye on him, alright.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.880
I'll miss you.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.280
Eddie?

14:15.600 --> 14:19.120
How could you kiss and play happy
families, after what they've done?!

14:19.120 --> 14:21.760
I told you, we've got
to keep 'em close.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.640
One wrong word, and we'll wind
up getting buried in the desert.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.960
Mum, this is mad.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.000
Look baby, I know you're scared.

14:33.320 --> 14:36.520
No one is gonna hurt you.
What about you?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.840
They won't see me coming,

14:39.840 --> 14:42.640
and trust me, one-by-one,
they'll all go.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.640
What if you get caught?
I won't.

14:44.640 --> 14:47.120
I'm never going back to prison.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.040
Why did you get bird?

14:53.360 --> 14:56.880
The police found the gun
in the debris of the flat.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.760
My prints were on it.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.840
So I got ten years
for possession.

15:03.440 --> 15:05.480
A fucking decade.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.680
How long do we have to stay here?

15:18.320 --> 15:20.680
We let Gene get
somewhere with this hotel.

15:23.360 --> 15:25.440
I finish what I started...

15:27.000 --> 15:29.040
...then we take the money and run.

15:30.800 --> 15:34.040
Jamaica. Like your dad always said.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.720
Look. Look. Look.

15:39.720 --> 15:41.440
All you have to do...

15:42.360 --> 15:45.760
...is play nice, alright,
and stay schtum.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.440
What about him, Gene?

16:01.840 --> 16:03.520
He'll be the last to go.

16:06.640 --> 16:09.400
Gracias, amigo. Adios.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.440
Yeah, alright.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.040
Easy, Abdul.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.720
Windy, innit? Woo.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.480
Oi, Abdul.
This place anywhere nearby?

16:43.480 --> 16:45.800
Oi, I'm talking to you, son!

16:45.800 --> 16:47.000
Len.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.600
What you on about?
The Mayor's in Morocco too.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.640
I need to get in front of him
about our planning permission.

16:54.640 --> 16:58.160
Mate. I thought you sorted it.
Don't get lemon, Gene, I will.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.720
So, you lied to Dad, as well?!

17:04.840 --> 17:07.240
You're not the only one
trying to make him proud.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.080
Mate, one more fucking time.

17:17.080 --> 17:19.320
Hey. Hey. Leonard. Leonard.
Hey. My friends!

17:20.400 --> 17:22.280
My friend. English, yes?

17:22.280 --> 17:25.400
Yeah.
Queen Elizabeth! Margaret Thatcher!

17:25.400 --> 17:28.120
Kenny Dalglish! Yeah. Come!

17:28.120 --> 17:30.400
Come with me!

17:30.400 --> 17:32.240
Mr Chaffik?
Come. Come.

17:32.240 --> 17:37.760
I have some bargains for you.
Televisions, VCR, radios!

17:37.760 --> 17:39.800
Come. Come.

17:46.240 --> 17:49.240
Welcome sit down. Sit.

17:59.920 --> 18:02.200
You're Mr Chaffik?

18:06.840 --> 18:09.640
That's a name you won't use
again outside of this place.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.400
Alright, Kel?
Alright Cind.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.680
Look, I know we haven't
really spoken much,

18:21.680 --> 18:25.640
but I just wanted to say thanks,
you know, for looking after Eddie,

18:25.640 --> 18:28.800
and bringing him over here,
he said you're proper reem.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.800
Need a hand?

18:32.800 --> 18:36.120
Yeah, yeah, I do actually,
loading up,

18:36.120 --> 18:38.600
having a little soiree
on the beach later.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.800
Nice.
Yeah.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.480
Can I ask you a favour, Kelly?

18:43.480 --> 18:46.120
Everyone says you're
a bit of a charmer and, erm,

18:46.120 --> 18:48.640
I just wondered if you could take
Eddie along, you, know maybe

18:48.640 --> 18:51.240
show him the ropes.
Meet some new people and that.

18:51.240 --> 18:55.440
Yeah, you mean like the ladies?
Yeah, course I can, course.

18:55.440 --> 18:58.080
I mean, we all know what it's
like been the odd one out, don't we?

18:58.080 --> 18:59.880
You're telling me.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.680
Hmm. Beach party, yeah?

19:02.680 --> 19:05.520
Looks like you've got
this coast already sewn up.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.960
You know us Lords.
Yeah. I'm beginning to.

19:10.280 --> 19:13.840
Yeah. You know I used to, er,
I used to DJ at the Blitz club?

19:13.840 --> 19:16.240
Yeah.
Yeah, like pals with Boy George,

19:16.240 --> 19:18.280
Steve Strange, all of them. Wow.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.920
Yeah. Yeah, pretty big time.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.680
Amazing.
There you go.

19:22.680 --> 19:25.280
Well, have a good time, alright.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.200
Here, here, come on.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.640
Cop for that.
Stick those over there. Come on son.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.680
We'll have a party, Ed.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.400
You'll never guess
what the guys are planning.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.280
Beach party, eh?
Yeah.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.520
Oi, oi.
We should go. Surprise 'em.

19:43.520 --> 19:46.480
It'll be full of young'uns.
Exactly.

19:46.480 --> 19:50.040
Muscles, toned-flesh,
what do you reckon Carls?

19:50.040 --> 19:55.080
Yeah, fuck it, why not eh, Mint Ma?
Oh, come on Ma, girls night out?

19:55.080 --> 19:57.160
I was hoping to take you for lunch.
Aye, aye.

19:58.920 --> 20:01.320
What you wearing that old thing for?
Still fits.

20:02.200 --> 20:05.200
Just.
Did my finest work in this.

20:25.160 --> 20:29.000
Thank you.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.080
Hey, mate! Mate! It's alright.
Don't worry.

20:33.080 --> 20:36.600
I will be the judge
of what is alright, in my own home.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.640
Fair enough.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.880
These are from
my family's land in Spain,

20:50.880 --> 20:55.080
which I hope we can both use to grow
something just as beautiful.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.600
Shukran.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.840
Really pushed the boat
out there, kid.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.400
This is why you're here for, correct?

21:33.960 --> 21:35.640
Hi.
Lord.

21:35.640 --> 21:38.400
Welcome. This way, please.

21:39.600 --> 21:43.160
Fancy. I like it, Albert Lord.

21:43.160 --> 21:45.960
You remember
when I bought this suit?

21:45.960 --> 21:50.440
1969. Savile Row.
I had a wardrobe-full.

21:51.320 --> 21:56.400
You too, furs, shoes,
Mary Quant dresses.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.160
Top of the pile, remember?

22:02.200 --> 22:04.400
What happened to us, Alb?

22:10.560 --> 22:12.680
We'll get it back.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.400
Top of the pile again.

22:16.040 --> 22:18.760
We can have it here, in the sun.
You know that, don't you?

22:19.640 --> 22:21.440
That's why I'm so proud of you, Alb,

22:21.440 --> 22:24.200
for letting our boys
spread their wings.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.560
Mush. Which one's Tariq?
Who?

22:32.000 --> 22:35.320
Order what you want, Ginge,
I'll be back in jiffy.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.400
That Tariq.
Mm-hmm.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.440
Little change of plan.

22:53.760 --> 22:55.440
Albert Lord.

22:57.280 --> 22:59.520
You, er... you know my son.

23:09.560 --> 23:13.440
We know our cove is the safest point
on the Costa to land your boats.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.600
You continue to use it
as an entry point,

23:15.600 --> 23:18.720
but we want two hundred keys on top
of what the Dutch bring in.

23:19.800 --> 23:22.480
They keep theirs,
and we sell the rest in the UK.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.480
And you think you can
move all that product?

23:24.480 --> 23:27.160
Mate. Everyone in South London's
out of their fucking head.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.640
It's a piece of piss.

23:29.960 --> 23:31.280
You can finance it?

23:33.080 --> 23:35.000
We were hoping...

23:35.920 --> 23:37.800
...proposing...

23:37.800 --> 23:39.800
that we pay you on the back end.

23:41.080 --> 23:43.160
With interest, of course.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.320
Very dangerous way to do business.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.600
We can iron out the numbers
if we agree in principle.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.160
Of course, we don't have to let
you use our land at all.

23:58.160 --> 24:00.000
And we don't have
to sell the hashish.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.640
That'd be fucking stupid,
wouldn't it?

24:01.640 --> 24:03.760
We'd be back at the start,
but you've lost your route.

24:03.760 --> 24:05.760
Listen, boys,
we're on the same team here.

24:06.880 --> 24:10.320
Relax.
Please, try this, it's a tradition.

24:10.320 --> 24:13.320
Drop us out.
You think you can get us buzzed,

24:13.320 --> 24:15.760
and we'll agree to anything. Behave.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.320
Fuck it.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.440
How can you buy
without first trying?

24:25.280 --> 24:27.600
Deep into your lungs.

24:46.840 --> 24:49.440
Ohh.

24:50.560 --> 24:55.600
Now, that's, er...
That's sweet mate, that's bang on.

24:57.520 --> 24:59.520
You will hear from my superiors.

24:59.520 --> 25:02.800
Please accept this as a token for
our gratitude for coming to see us.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.520
Salam alaikum.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.440
Gene, what the fuck?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.680
Relax.

25:11.880 --> 25:15.240
What's wrong with you.
Come on, let's go.

25:15.240 --> 25:16.920
Where you going?

25:23.280 --> 25:25.560
Alright, wait.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.520
You alright there, Bob Marley?

25:41.160 --> 25:45.240
I'm buzzing mate.
Why didn't you try some?

25:45.240 --> 25:48.080
Cos I didn't fancy getting
bummed on a magic carpet.

25:50.920 --> 25:54.040
State of you.

25:56.080 --> 25:58.320
Liven yourself up
and meet me at the docks.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.040
I'm gonna sort the Mayor.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.640
Not for me.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.160
Woah.
American?

26:29.160 --> 26:30.960
No, English.
Passport, please.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.720
English. English.

27:03.880 --> 27:06.880
'Relax. You're only buying oranges.'

27:14.160 --> 27:17.560
'You can blag a couple
of Arab Greengrocers, can't ya.

27:17.560 --> 27:21.040
'Use your charm Gene,
you know you've got plenty of it.'

27:23.400 --> 27:25.680
'I'm proud of you son.'

27:31.720 --> 27:36.160
Wake up, English.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.960
Not long now.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.800
No. You don't need
that poster there.

28:07.800 --> 28:09.640
Yeah, we do.
Fucking hell.

28:09.640 --> 28:11.440
Right, come on, boys.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.200
Oi. Give us one.

28:15.200 --> 28:16.880
Oi. Chop-chop.

28:18.200 --> 28:19.880
Watch out there, Eddie.

28:22.280 --> 28:24.240
You too, Ant,
and easy on those beers.

28:26.520 --> 28:29.320
You're a real-life saver, Eddie.
Look at that.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.920
I thought your lot
were supposed to be strong.

28:31.920 --> 28:34.800
If half the people
that we've flyered, turn up,

28:34.800 --> 28:36.280
we're gonna be caked.

28:36.280 --> 28:39.680
And he'll still be potless, mug.
Drop me out, Anthony.

28:41.680 --> 28:44.160
Come on then Eddie.
Give us a butchers.

28:44.160 --> 28:47.200
He's got a back like pork crackling.
Pig's back.

28:47.200 --> 28:51.880
Cut it. Come on.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.960
Anti-depressants?

29:19.640 --> 29:22.120
It only took ten minutes.
I should have fucking known

29:22.120 --> 29:24.480
you would pull a stroke.
Who do you think pays for this?

29:26.120 --> 29:27.600
Why have you got the hump?

29:27.600 --> 29:29.840
Ey, you got a nice meal out of it,
didn't you?

29:29.840 --> 29:32.000
And what did you get?
You'll see.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.960
Sums you up, really.

29:33.960 --> 29:37.760
Take me on a 'date,'
then side door me,

29:37.760 --> 29:39.960
while you go off and talk
to some Toby on a boat.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.560
You know, when I asked you earlier,
what happened?

29:50.800 --> 29:53.840
Why did we end up
at the bottom of the pile?

29:53.840 --> 29:58.200
The answer is you. It's always you.

29:59.720 --> 30:02.520
You don't see the bigger picture,
do you?

30:02.520 --> 30:04.720
You're always looking in the gutter.

30:06.360 --> 30:09.040
Not appreciating what
you've already got...

30:09.040 --> 30:10.760
including me.

30:10.760 --> 30:13.080
Everything I've done was for you,
and for the family-Oh!

30:13.080 --> 30:15.040
Don't give me that old bollocks.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.880
I'm going out with the girls.

30:16.880 --> 30:19.680
You can stay here and convince
yourself you are still a gangster.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.880
Ginger. Don't walk away from me.

Please, call me Leonard.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.600
I was hoping me coming here
would show you how serious

32:04.600 --> 32:06.760
we are about building our hotel.

32:09.400 --> 32:12.200
Do you ride?
Only on the beach, at Margate.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.960
Is that a racecourse?
No, it's a... Nah...

32:18.040 --> 32:21.120
I don't ride, but I know my horses.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.000
Grown up around a lot of bookies.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.600
Khalil here's an Arab Appaloosa.

32:28.640 --> 32:32.080
A cross between an Arabian
thoroughbred and an Appaloosa.

32:33.240 --> 32:36.080
Hard-working, refined...

32:37.320 --> 32:40.360
...and intelligent enough
to understand who's in charge.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.800
Hmm.

32:46.360 --> 32:48.080
I'm thinking of buying him.

32:49.040 --> 32:50.720
What do you think?

33:05.680 --> 33:08.920
Bad teeth.
First thing bookies look for.

33:09.840 --> 33:12.960
Could be Shergar's brother,
but if it can't eat,

33:12.960 --> 33:14.480
it can't run.

33:15.320 --> 33:17.000
Or dance.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.600
Who gave you this?

33:44.640 --> 33:46.320
Face forward.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.000
I'm just a tourist
here on a day trip.

33:53.520 --> 33:57.120
Do you know what the penalty
is for drug trafficking in Morocco?

33:59.680 --> 34:02.200
Death... that is the penalty.

34:02.200 --> 34:05.200
I want a lawyer.
I want a lawyer.

34:17.200 --> 34:19.160
Is that the man who gave
you the hashish?

34:21.640 --> 34:23.720
I've never seen that
man before in my life.

34:24.880 --> 34:27.560
This man is a known drug trafficker.

34:27.560 --> 34:30.400
You were seen entering his property.

34:36.360 --> 34:38.240
He said you tried
to sell him the hashish.

34:38.240 --> 34:39.880
It's bullshit-

34:39.880 --> 34:43.280
I will give you to the count
of five to tell me the truth. Five!

34:43.280 --> 34:45.080
Listen. Listen.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.760
I'm just here on a day trip.

34:46.760 --> 34:49.600
I've never seen this
man before in my life!

34:50.960 --> 34:52.920
Four.
In my shop,

34:52.920 --> 34:54.480
you can find tomatoes from Spain.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.200
Shut the fuck up!

34:58.560 --> 35:00.840
Three.

35:00.840 --> 35:02.400
Tell them the truth!

35:02.400 --> 35:06.120
Tell him the truth, Gene.
How does he know your name?!

35:06.960 --> 35:08.880
How does he know your name?

35:10.080 --> 35:11.160
Two.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.600
One.

35:33.880 --> 35:35.640
Good try. Good try.

36:01.960 --> 36:05.720
Magloubah.
Made with your delicious tomatoes.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.760
The gift was a nice gesture.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.480
Thank you.

36:20.240 --> 36:22.400
I like you, Gene.

36:22.400 --> 36:26.280
But you've got some balls asking
for half a ton of hashish on credit.

36:28.880 --> 36:31.200
It was quarter of a ton, actually.

36:32.360 --> 36:33.880
What do you take me for?

36:33.880 --> 36:36.760
You think we're stupid Moroccans
you British can divide and rule?

36:36.760 --> 36:39.760
No, no, no, of course not.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.680
You've got no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

36:48.000 --> 36:50.400
While you were talking to us
this morning,

36:50.400 --> 36:53.000
your father met with Tariq in Spain,

36:53.000 --> 36:55.400
and they agreed
to double the shipment.

37:04.480 --> 37:08.040
I'm surprised. Didn't you know this?

37:10.560 --> 37:12.320
If that's what he wants.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.600
You see,
I'm here on my father's behalf,

37:14.600 --> 37:17.320
so if he wants us to increase
the load, then that's down to him.

37:19.720 --> 37:21.800
Wait! Wait! But... Hey!

37:33.760 --> 37:35.520
I'm not going home empty handed.

37:37.640 --> 37:41.040
I'm running this operation,
but my father runs our family.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.560
You can trust us.

37:48.680 --> 37:51.760
You get one chance to impress.
Tariq will supervise.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.680
You saved me a lot of money today.

38:06.560 --> 38:08.680
I could make you a lot more...

38:10.080 --> 38:12.600
...if you help me with planning
permission to build a hotel.

38:14.520 --> 38:17.320
I don't think I want to know how
you make your money, Senor Lord...

38:18.400 --> 38:21.080
...but the Costa needs all
the investment, it can get.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.800
So you'll help?

38:24.520 --> 38:26.400
Show me your plans when we're back.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.240
But I'm sure I can be persuaded.

38:59.040 --> 39:02.400
I sorted it, kid.
Like I said I would.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.320
What's wrong?

39:10.840 --> 39:14.040
Dad got to the Moroccans
before I even met them.

39:15.080 --> 39:17.960
And did what?
Made a bigger deal.

39:20.040 --> 39:22.080
Len, he's got no idea
what he's doing.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.040
If this goes wrong, then we're dead.

39:25.200 --> 39:27.520
All of us.
They've got a fucking army out here.

39:35.320 --> 39:37.640
They stuck a sack over my head
and put me on my knees.

39:37.640 --> 39:40.240
And then they stuck
a gun in my fucking face.

39:42.560 --> 39:44.120
I could have been killed,
down to him.

39:48.360 --> 39:50.080
It could only have been, Kelly.

39:51.440 --> 39:53.240
Look, don't say anything, Gene.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.640
We'll work it out.

39:58.240 --> 40:01.720
Don't confront him, alright.
It's not worth it.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.960
Just keep schtum, yeah.

40:09.720 --> 40:12.320
'I know Dad can be unpredictable...'

40:13.960 --> 40:15.640
'..but he's in charge.'

40:26.600 --> 40:31.440
Ah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Now that is
what I'm talking about.

40:32.400 --> 40:35.840
Gorgeous. We are ready to dance.

40:37.680 --> 40:40.720
Wait here for me, yeah?
Cinco minutos.

40:40.720 --> 40:41.920
Vale, gracias.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.520
'And deep down...'

40:47.720 --> 40:49.560
'..he just wants
what's best for us.'

40:56.160 --> 40:59.600
Hold on to this.
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Mint Ma.

41:00.640 --> 41:03.840
Gorgeous.
Oh, look at the water.

41:03.840 --> 41:07.560
Amazing!
Right, let's do it, ladies!

41:34.400 --> 41:36.360
Everyone knows the Lords in London.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.360
That's why I like it here, you know.

41:38.360 --> 41:40.080
Yeah, sure.
Cos we're no one.

41:40.080 --> 41:42.720
Erm... Is your brother Gene coming?

41:42.720 --> 41:44.440
Gene?
Yes.

41:44.440 --> 41:47.120
No, he's not invited. Oh.

41:47.120 --> 41:49.320
Oi! Oi!
Woohoo!

41:50.840 --> 41:54.400
What are you doing here, Ma?
Oh, sorry, we couldn't resist.

41:55.520 --> 41:58.240
Where's your husband?
He wasn't invited.

41:58.240 --> 42:00.240
Oh, that's a shame,
you are a lovely couple.

42:00.240 --> 42:03.480
Well, you obviously haven't
heard he's a two bob cunt.

42:05.280 --> 42:08.920
Do you know what? Just for tonight:

42:08.920 --> 42:11.160
fuck the Lords,

42:11.160 --> 42:12.920
we're the Ladies.
Wooo!

42:12.920 --> 42:18.080
To the Ladies!
Yeah! Here's to us. Come on Ma.

42:18.080 --> 42:20.120
Cheers.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.680
Hey, Kel. Where's Eddie?
He's around somewhere.

42:24.680 --> 42:26.880
Alright cool, I'm gonna go
and check him alright.

42:26.880 --> 42:28.560
Just give me a minute.

42:28.560 --> 42:30.760
Yeah, so, what I'm saying is,
you know, starting again,

42:30.760 --> 42:33.600
