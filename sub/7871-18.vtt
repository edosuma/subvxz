00:17.475 --> 00:19.142
(screams)

00:19.193 --> 00:21.144
(all screaming)

00:21.178 --> 00:23.230
GRAMPA:
Hey!

00:24.865 --> 00:25.865
D'oh!

00:27.218 --> 00:29.019
Our poor couch.

00:29.053 --> 00:31.655
It sure has taken
a beating over the years.

00:31.689 --> 00:33.690
Might be time to get a new one.

00:33.724 --> 00:35.859
Really? You want
to throw something out

00:35.893 --> 00:37.694
just because
it's a little old?

00:37.728 --> 00:39.129
Hello, everybody.

00:39.163 --> 00:41.298
(mumbling):
Rotten, damn, lousy...

00:41.332 --> 00:43.800
(humming)

00:43.834 --> 00:46.403
Ow!

00:48.272 --> 00:49.856
Are there
any two words

00:49.881 --> 00:52.821
more exciting than
"couch shopping"?

00:52.846 --> 00:54.595
No need. Already went online

00:54.620 --> 00:56.493
and ordered a new couch
just like the old one.

00:56.752 --> 00:59.003
And, you know, Marge,
those salespeople

00:59.038 --> 01:01.022
weren't really
our friends.

01:01.056 --> 01:03.908
But they let me
take fabric samples.

01:03.943 --> 01:05.877
They charged a deposit.

01:05.911 --> 01:06.911
They had to.

01:06.946 --> 01:08.713
It came from
corporate.

01:08.747 --> 01:12.066
That's right, sweetie,
it always comes from corporate.

01:15.771 --> 01:18.389
Hey, this one's going
to Springfield.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.309
Chumps. Don't everyone know
that all New York furniture

01:21.343 --> 01:22.644
is full of bedbugs?

01:22.678 --> 01:24.195
Forget about it!

01:24.230 --> 01:25.847
It's forgot abouten!

01:29.251 --> 01:30.602
(impressed murmuring)
Ooh, wow.

01:31.837 --> 01:33.421
(sniffs) Mmm.

01:33.455 --> 01:35.590
New cushion smell.

01:35.624 --> 01:38.209
I'm gonna put all my
stuffed animals on it.

01:38.244 --> 01:40.044
(humming)
All right, get comfy.

01:48.170 --> 01:51.339
Gentlemen, the fort is complete
and will stand forever.

01:51.373 --> 01:54.309
No way the Nazis
will get in here.

01:54.343 --> 01:56.961
Oh, I thought
we were the Nazis.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074

02:15.114 --> 02:19.017
The latest New York fashion has
come to Springfield: bedbugs.

02:19.051 --> 02:22.420
Ew, just hearing
about them makes me itch.

02:22.454 --> 02:25.690
Ooh, ooh. Funny how
the brain does that, huh?

02:25.724 --> 02:28.042
It's making me see them.

02:28.076 --> 02:30.995
(laughs)
The brain is so stupid.

02:31.030 --> 02:33.214
(screams)
Those are bedbugs!

02:34.500 --> 02:36.367
How did we get bedbugs?

02:36.402 --> 02:38.186
Probably one
of Bart's dirty friends.

02:38.220 --> 02:40.355
Boy, why are your
friends so dirty?

02:40.389 --> 02:42.707
Don't know. Why are
your friends such drunks?

02:42.741 --> 02:44.475
Touché.

02:47.379 --> 02:49.948
I know this seems bad,
but nothing brings out

02:49.982 --> 02:52.483
the best in Springfield
like a crisis.

02:52.518 --> 02:54.953
(groaning)

02:55.258 --> 02:57.059
Bring out your bed!

02:57.093 --> 02:59.194
Bring out your bed!

03:01.314 --> 03:02.831
FLANDERS:
No!

03:12.525 --> 03:14.409
Hold my hand.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.944
(groans)

03:15.979 --> 03:18.614
People, there is
no need to worry.

03:18.665 --> 03:22.501
I have developed
the perfect bedbug repellant.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.369
(crowd gasping
and murmuring)

03:24.403 --> 03:29.675
You see, behold the power
of modified bear pheromones.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.193
(groaning)

03:34.547 --> 03:36.548
Marge, Milhouse
was clean as a whistle

03:36.583 --> 03:38.433
till he played
with your boy.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.986
Now, we don't know
it was the Simpsons.

03:41.020 --> 03:44.690
I think the most obvious
culprit is the poorest family.

03:44.724 --> 03:45.724
'Tweren't us.

03:45.758 --> 03:47.392
We don't even have beds.

03:47.427 --> 03:49.945
We sleep in washtubs
and coffins.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.514
Why won't somebody
blame the children?

03:52.548 --> 03:54.816
Well, the good news
is it forced us all to church.

03:54.851 --> 03:56.285
You know, in the
Middle Ages,

03:56.319 --> 03:57.886
people took
refuge in church

03:57.921 --> 03:59.655
to escape the
bubonic plague,

03:59.689 --> 04:02.357
but that made the plague
spread even faster.

04:02.392 --> 04:03.742
Church!

04:03.776 --> 04:05.811
(indistinct arguing)

04:05.845 --> 04:09.314
Everyone, please,
calm down.

04:09.349 --> 04:10.983
Reverend Lovejoy is here.

04:11.017 --> 04:12.884
He will give us succor.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.386
(clears throat)

04:15.755 --> 04:18.557
The Epistle of Jeremy
is often cited

04:18.591 --> 04:22.227
as the most difficult book
of the Apocrypha.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.530
But to me,
none of the anagignoskomena

04:25.565 --> 04:28.400
are more contemplative
than the book of Tobit.

04:28.434 --> 04:31.236
(hooting and hollering)

04:31.271 --> 04:32.237
(hooting and hollering stops)

04:32.272 --> 04:33.438
(crowd gasps)

04:33.472 --> 04:36.108
Mind if I p-p-pray through?

04:36.142 --> 04:38.660
It's the parson.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.413
Are you gonna let
a sunny summer day be ruined

04:41.447 --> 04:43.515
by a few b-b-bugs?

04:43.549 --> 04:46.752
God's soldier in cardigan.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.253
Looks like I picked
a swell day

04:48.288 --> 04:50.389
to return your six iron,
Reverend.

04:50.423 --> 04:51.923
Now, looky here, Tim.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.526
This is a
five-alarm brouhaha.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.295
Now, for chili,
that's just dandy,

04:56.329 --> 04:58.764
but I brought you
a little backup.

04:58.798 --> 04:59.965
(clears throat)

04:59.999 --> 05:01.300
(chuckles)

05:01.334 --> 05:03.568
I think I'm more than
capable of handling this.

05:03.603 --> 05:07.773
Need I remind you
of the bingo riot last summer?

05:07.807 --> 05:10.475
God called all
their numbers that day.

05:10.509 --> 05:12.861
Please meet your new
associate minister,

05:12.895 --> 05:15.314
the Right Reverend
Elijah Hooper.

05:15.348 --> 05:17.599
He was the number two man
from Shelbyville.

05:17.633 --> 05:19.801
Introduced angle parking.

05:19.836 --> 05:22.220
We got in six more cars.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.039
Folks, isn't he something?

05:24.073 --> 05:26.041
Big hand
for Reverend Lovejoy.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.959
Mm-hmm.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.828
Everyone says great things
about you, Tim,

05:29.862 --> 05:31.079
and I can see why.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.915
The posture,
the haircut, the tiny feet.

05:33.950 --> 05:35.917
It's amazing
they hold you up.

05:35.952 --> 05:36.818
But they do.

05:36.853 --> 05:38.553
(chuckles)

05:38.588 --> 05:40.455
They do.

05:40.490 --> 05:42.024
So charming.

05:42.058 --> 05:44.926
It's like he's selling
silver polish at the state fair.

05:44.961 --> 05:46.345
Look, here's
why I'm here.

05:46.379 --> 05:49.014
Church should make you happy,
like a warm mug of soup.

05:49.048 --> 05:51.149
Why does it taste better
from a mug?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.118
I don't know, but it does.

05:53.152 --> 05:55.020
God help me,
I'm paying attention.

05:55.054 --> 05:56.755
Okay, who here
has read Leviticus?

05:56.789 --> 05:57.789
Mmm!

05:59.158 --> 06:02.127
Okay, now, who here
has seen <i>Meet the Parents?</i>

06:02.161 --> 06:05.297
Me! Me, me.
Me, me, me, me.

06:05.331 --> 06:07.933
Hilarious film; showed
a whole new side of De Niro.

06:07.967 --> 06:09.968
At first, he couldn't
stand his son-in-law,

06:10.002 --> 06:11.570
but then they patch things up
(snoring)

06:11.604 --> 06:12.871
in a comical
fashion, remember?

06:12.905 --> 06:15.507
The point is, at
the end of the day,

06:15.541 --> 06:16.875
we love each other.

06:16.909 --> 06:19.878
And that's all
this thing really says.

06:19.912 --> 06:21.179
(murmuring)

06:21.214 --> 06:23.281
So, don't waste your whole
Sunday listening to us.

06:23.316 --> 06:26.118
Go home and watch one
of the <i>Die Hard</i> movies on TV.

06:26.152 --> 06:29.221
They're always on,
and they're always good.

06:29.255 --> 06:31.156
And, ladies, drop in
on a neighbor's open house

06:31.190 --> 06:33.275
just to see what they did
with their sun room.

06:33.309 --> 06:34.276
Ooh. Ooh.
Ooh.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.877
Now, go on home.

06:35.912 --> 06:39.531
We're here every Sunday,
just like Snoopy in color.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.616
ALL:
Aw.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.351
Can you believe this guy, Helen?

06:43.386 --> 06:44.953
Hey... Helen?

06:44.987 --> 06:47.155
Tim.
Yes, Helen?

06:47.190 --> 06:49.891
My wedding ring is
creating a glare.

06:49.926 --> 06:51.626
Can you hold it?

06:51.661 --> 06:56.064
This is the worst 17th Sunday
in Ordinary Time ever.

06:59.339 --> 07:01.524
OTTO:
One day out of rehab, and I...

07:01.558 --> 07:04.727
Ooh... (laughs)

07:06.146 --> 07:07.663
Whoa. (laughs)

07:07.698 --> 07:11.000
(sniffs) Mmm, debugged
and fresh as a daisy.

07:11.034 --> 07:12.568
Cool.

07:12.603 --> 07:14.820
They give you a bag
of the bedbugs they killed.

07:14.855 --> 07:16.038
(laughs)

07:16.073 --> 07:18.140
Homer's oatmeal,
meet your raisins.

07:20.878 --> 07:24.263
Homer's Pie Man costume,
Lisa's red dress,

07:24.298 --> 07:26.832
Lisa's red dress,
Lisa's red dress,

07:26.867 --> 07:28.451
Sunday Best Bart...

07:28.485 --> 07:30.620
(gasps) Where is it?

07:30.654 --> 07:31.821
My wedding dress!

07:33.590 --> 07:36.926
Vodka? Is this Krusty's?

07:36.960 --> 07:39.395
A high-voltage monkey prod?

07:39.429 --> 07:42.565
(gasps) It is Krusty's.
He must have my dress.

07:42.599 --> 07:44.400
Let's go.
What's the hurry?

07:44.434 --> 07:47.970
I don't want a comedian
knowing my dress size.

07:48.005 --> 07:49.805
(humming)

07:49.840 --> 07:51.591
(gulps)

07:51.625 --> 07:54.393
Wait a minute!
This has oats in it!

07:54.428 --> 07:56.162
Ooh, a nose hair trimmer.

07:56.196 --> 07:57.363
(screams)

07:59.016 --> 08:01.617
Yeah, I found a wedding
dress in my dry cleaning.

08:01.652 --> 08:03.686
We used it in a sketch.

08:04.688 --> 08:06.989
Where's my
mail-order bride?

08:09.760 --> 08:12.728
Ugh, how long
was he in there?

08:12.763 --> 08:15.064
Don't worry, we cleaned
up the crate real good.

08:15.098 --> 08:16.599
What about my dress?

08:16.633 --> 08:19.502
Oh, gee, I'm afraid
that dress is long gone.

08:19.536 --> 08:22.755
I threw it out the window
during my post-show hissy fit.

08:23.924 --> 08:26.993
Some of us
don't have dressing rooms.

08:27.027 --> 08:28.561
CARL: <i>Wooden!</i>
LENNY: <i>Plastic.</i>

08:28.595 --> 08:30.129
Wooden.
Plastic.

08:30.163 --> 08:32.164
Why do we always argue
over coffee stirrers?

08:32.198 --> 08:33.966
You know what's
really stirring?

08:34.001 --> 08:35.568
Live,
local theater.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.269
(all laughing)
Yeah.

08:37.304 --> 08:39.905
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
before I let a Holy Joe

08:39.940 --> 08:42.107
walk in this bar,
I got to know

08:42.142 --> 08:44.577
which of the two
true faiths you represent.

08:44.611 --> 08:47.647
Well, I represent an easygoing
offshoot of Protestantism.

08:47.681 --> 08:50.416
That is the wrong thing
to say to a snake handler.

08:50.450 --> 08:51.851
Easy, Moe, easy.

08:51.885 --> 08:54.120
Ah, this thing's
just loaded with rock salt.

08:54.154 --> 08:56.589
I use it to keep the raccoons
out of my fridge.

08:56.623 --> 08:59.375
And, of course, to coat the rims
of my margarita glasses.

09:04.414 --> 09:06.716
Uh, Padre, can I
be honest with you?

09:06.750 --> 09:09.552
I've sucked every church
book ribbon there is

09:09.586 --> 09:12.188
hoping to find one
made of cherry.

09:12.222 --> 09:13.723
But there isn't.

09:13.757 --> 09:16.392
And if it's such
a "good book,"

09:16.426 --> 09:18.527
how come there's no
blurbs on the back?

09:18.562 --> 09:20.096
Not even David Sedaris.

09:20.130 --> 09:21.864
And he'll flack anything.

09:21.898 --> 09:23.966
Seriously, "pews"?

09:24.001 --> 09:25.401
Homer, I love
your passion.

09:25.435 --> 09:27.570
It's terrific.
It's really something.

09:27.604 --> 09:29.238
Listen, I'm just thinking.

09:29.272 --> 09:31.390
Would you consider
being my deacon?

09:31.425 --> 09:33.392
Deacon? Is that
like one of those

09:33.427 --> 09:35.161
weird Catholic priest things?

09:35.195 --> 09:38.497
No, not at all.
It's like a sexton or a rector.

09:38.532 --> 09:41.000
Oh, now we're talking.
But why me?

09:41.034 --> 09:43.669
Because, if I can get the man
who sleeps through church

09:43.704 --> 09:46.238
to be my guy,
this town will know

09:46.273 --> 09:48.541
that religion
can be fun.

09:48.575 --> 09:52.411
Well, I'm not one for
taking new jobs on a whim.

09:52.446 --> 09:54.680
But, as we say in the
snow plow business,

09:54.715 --> 09:56.916
I'm your astronaut.

09:59.302 --> 10:01.537
What do you think?

10:01.571 --> 10:03.906
I didn't think
Shotgun Mike's Bridal Store

10:03.940 --> 10:06.876
had a nice dress,
but you found it.

10:06.910 --> 10:09.211
Homer, you're not supposed
to see the dress

10:09.246 --> 10:10.863
before the wedding.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.665
Just looking for the bathroom.
(woman screams)

10:12.699 --> 10:14.917
This is not
the bathroom!

10:14.951 --> 10:18.020
Aw, but this paper towel
feels so good.

10:18.055 --> 10:20.456
I'm sorry your
dress is gone, Mom.

10:20.490 --> 10:22.425
Oh, sweetie,
it's not for me.

10:22.459 --> 10:25.561
I wanted you to wear
that dress at your wedding.

10:25.595 --> 10:27.296
Well, then,
you shouldn't feel bad,

10:27.330 --> 10:30.466
because I can't imagine myself
ever getting married.

10:30.500 --> 10:31.951
(gasps)

10:31.985 --> 10:35.287
Homer, your daughter
doesn't want to get married.

10:35.322 --> 10:37.223
That would save us
several hundred bucks.

10:37.257 --> 10:39.075
Tell her she's wrong!

10:39.109 --> 10:40.709
Right. Uh,

10:40.744 --> 10:42.211
I don't understand, Lisa.

10:42.245 --> 10:44.980
We let you get up early
to watch the Royal Wedding.

10:45.015 --> 10:46.916
Hey, I have a
weakness for pomp.

10:46.950 --> 10:49.385
Since when?

10:49.419 --> 10:50.553
HOOPER:
<i>So, you see,</i>

10:50.587 --> 10:52.455
what Jesus is saying

10:52.489 --> 10:53.956
really can be explained

10:53.990 --> 10:55.925
by an episode
of <i>Californication.</i>

10:55.959 --> 10:58.294
ALL:
Oh.

10:58.328 --> 11:00.629
Now Reverend Lovejoy
will lead us in song.

11:00.664 --> 11:03.816
♪ God lifts you up

11:03.850 --> 11:05.151

11:09.756 --> 11:11.607

11:11.641 --> 11:14.643
Um... give me a minute.

11:14.678 --> 11:17.813
Uh, but first, let me introduce
our new deacon-- Homer Simpson!

11:17.848 --> 11:19.982
It's an honor, sir.

11:20.016 --> 11:22.118
(applause)

11:22.152 --> 11:24.320
Homer Simpson a
deacon? But why?

11:24.354 --> 11:26.989
You bring in the lost sheep,
and the others will follow.

11:27.023 --> 11:29.091
Lost sheep. Yes!
Sis boom bah!

11:29.126 --> 11:30.926
(chuckling)

11:30.961 --> 11:34.029
I don't think there's a place
for me here anymore.

11:34.064 --> 11:36.899
Heading for the door,
pushing the handle.

11:38.135 --> 11:40.603
Left foot across the threshold.

11:40.637 --> 11:43.472
Now the right.

11:43.507 --> 11:45.307
Walking to car.

11:45.342 --> 11:47.209
Stepped in hole.

11:47.244 --> 11:49.011
Twisted ankle.

11:49.045 --> 11:51.046
Tremendous pain.

11:51.081 --> 11:53.232
Keep it elevated.

11:54.497 --> 11:56.131
Church bulletin?
Church bulletin?

11:56.567 --> 11:58.935
Find out in whose loving memory
this week's service is.

11:59.434 --> 12:00.801
The answer may shock you.

12:00.835 --> 12:02.102
Dad?

12:02.137 --> 12:03.971
You always hated church.

12:04.005 --> 12:06.440
Now, for the record,
I hated the building,

12:06.474 --> 12:09.109
the people in it
and the spirit it represented.

12:09.144 --> 12:11.445
I never hated
the church itself.

12:11.479 --> 12:15.616
And now, finally, I believe
in something bigger than myself.

12:15.650 --> 12:18.118
The only thing bigger than you
is you tomorrow.

12:18.153 --> 12:19.620
Why, you little...

12:19.654 --> 12:21.038
lamb.

12:21.072 --> 12:23.874
Oh. Mustn't...
kill own son.

12:23.908 --> 12:26.460
Only God can do that.

Someone finally took one.

13:04.699 --> 13:07.935
I'm mentioned in it
'cause I'm sick.

13:09.871 --> 13:13.006
Sorry, Maggie. I just don't
have the touch today.

13:13.041 --> 13:14.725
(burps)

13:14.759 --> 13:16.310
(burps)

13:16.344 --> 13:18.078
Mom, I found
your wedding dress.

13:18.112 --> 13:19.680
(gasps)

13:19.714 --> 13:21.181
How?

13:21.216 --> 13:24.001
Using something
this town has never, ever seen--

13:24.035 --> 13:26.703
good, honest police work.

13:26.738 --> 13:28.722
<i>I staked out the alley</i>

13:28.773 --> 13:31.058
<i>and befriended the garbage man</i>
<i>who took it.</i>

13:31.092 --> 13:33.160
<i>Then he gave it</i>
<i>to a local theater company,</i>

13:33.194 --> 13:35.178

<i>unsuccessful version</i>

13:35.213 --> 13:37.047

13:39.651 --> 13:42.286
That couple
right there.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.721
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

13:44.756 --> 13:46.707
Oh.

13:46.741 --> 13:48.775
Thank you for
finding it, sweetie.

13:48.810 --> 13:51.211
And seeing someone
else get married in it

13:51.246 --> 13:53.447
is better than
having it myself.

13:53.481 --> 13:55.549
You never know, Mom.
I'm only eight.

13:55.583 --> 13:57.184
I might get married someday,

13:57.218 --> 13:59.253
even if it's only
a green card marriage

13:59.287 --> 14:01.922
to keep a Chinese dissident
from being deported.

14:01.956 --> 14:04.791
We can have the

Want to go moon it with me?

14:29.801 --> 14:32.603
Son, I'd love to,
but I'm a deacon now.

14:32.637 --> 14:35.973
My butt's place
is in my pants.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.144
(grunting)

14:43.548 --> 14:45.849
(sighs) Church songs
with clapping.

14:45.883 --> 14:48.752
I don't think this is what
Martin Presbyluther had in mind

14:48.786 --> 14:50.153
when he founded our religion

14:50.188 --> 14:51.688
by sticking his
Three Suggestions

14:51.723 --> 14:53.457
under the Pope's
windshield wiper.

14:53.491 --> 14:55.325
Mr. Flanders,
this new reverend has thrown tar

14:55.360 --> 14:56.943
in your half-pipe, too?

14:56.978 --> 14:59.363
I don't understand that
on any level, but yes.

14:59.397 --> 15:00.781
Well, let's get Lovejoy back.

15:00.815 --> 15:02.699
Do you know where he is?

15:02.734 --> 15:06.269
He's in a place full of
brimstone and exposed flesh.

15:06.304 --> 15:08.271
You mean he's selling hot tubs?

15:08.306 --> 15:09.373
Yes.

15:11.976 --> 15:14.711
The 7500 is all about
jets, jets, jets.

15:14.746 --> 15:16.997
That's the one place
you cannot cut corners.

15:17.048 --> 15:19.115
That, of course,
and underwater speakers.

15:19.133 --> 15:21.301
That sounds expensive.
I need this, Apu.

15:21.336 --> 15:23.286
Sir, can you please
turn up the bubbles

15:23.304 --> 15:25.138
so we can argue
in private here?

15:25.173 --> 15:27.808
We wouldn't have to do this
if you remembered your Hindi.

15:27.842 --> 15:29.393
Oh, I remember it.

15:29.427 --> 15:31.228
I'm just pretending
I can't understand you.

15:31.262 --> 15:33.480
Reverend, we want you
to come back.

15:33.514 --> 15:34.948
Well, let's face it.

15:34.982 --> 15:36.717
I wasn't cut out
for that job.

15:36.751 --> 15:38.452
Nobody listened.

15:38.486 --> 15:40.904
Look, the boy's not
even listening now.

15:40.938 --> 15:43.857
He's right-- these underwater
speakers are amazing.

15:43.908 --> 15:47.194
(Bart hums a tune underwater)

15:47.245 --> 15:49.162
Reverend, this is just
the kind of tomfoolery

15:49.197 --> 15:51.147
that's been on the
upswing since you left.

15:51.165 --> 15:53.417
Pure, unadulterated
tomfoolery!

15:53.451 --> 15:55.318
We shall take
the 7500.

15:55.353 --> 15:57.688
And not a single
jet more!

15:57.722 --> 15:59.072
Sorry, Ned.

15:59.107 --> 16:00.874
I finally found
my calling.

16:00.908 --> 16:03.810
How are you guys fixed
for decking?

16:03.845 --> 16:05.712
Oh, what a surprise.

16:05.747 --> 16:08.882
A huge new expense
you didn't tell us about.

16:08.916 --> 16:10.517
We've lost him.

16:10.551 --> 16:12.302
Buddy, there's a 50
in my vest pocket.

16:12.336 --> 16:13.820
Will you buy us some beers? 
(gasps)

16:15.450 --> 16:18.118
The only cool thing about my dad
was that he hated church.

16:18.169 --> 16:20.936
And now he's turned into
a fat version of Flanders.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.039
No offense.
None taken.

16:24.375 --> 16:25.525
(Flanders scoffs)

16:25.576 --> 16:27.243
God doesn't need
Twitter to reach people.

16:27.278 --> 16:28.828
He uses leprosy
and plagues.

16:28.863 --> 16:32.215
Hmm. Plagues.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.752
Ew, locusts.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.387
Darkness. Yawn.

16:37.421 --> 16:38.955
(gasps)
Bingo!

16:38.989 --> 16:40.773
Flanders, are you willing
to get Lovejoy back

16:40.808 --> 16:42.208
by hook or by crook?

16:42.259 --> 16:43.593
Neither, and I don't like it

16:43.627 --> 16:45.178
when other people rhyme.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.746
Yes, but
if I do something,

16:46.780 --> 16:49.098
will you look the other way?
Hmm.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.884
I'd like to turn
in this boy

16:50.918 --> 16:52.435
for thinking about doing
something naughty,

16:52.469 --> 16:53.970
and myself
for waiting 30 seconds

16:54.004 --> 16:55.421
before bringing him here.

16:55.456 --> 16:57.357
Whatever.
Take 'em away, boys.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.025
And that's why Flanders
will never, ever be

16:59.059 --> 17:00.443
my partner in crime again.

17:00.477 --> 17:01.694
Thanks for
bailing me out.

17:01.729 --> 17:02.962
Yeah, but don't push it.

17:02.997 --> 17:04.464
There's only so many times

17:04.498 --> 17:06.031
I can tell Nana
it's my birthday.

17:06.066 --> 17:08.067
Now, what's this prank?

17:08.102 --> 17:10.819
First, we got every
dead bedbug in town.

17:10.854 --> 17:13.223
To think those
exterminators were just

17:13.257 --> 17:15.290
going to throw
these beauties away.

17:15.326 --> 17:18.428
Now, to leave a nice, clean
trail of bugs out of the swamp.

17:18.462 --> 17:22.165
The frogs follow, and Hooper's
got a plague he can't handle.

17:24.602 --> 17:27.637
(frogs croaking)

17:27.671 --> 17:30.306
Ugh! One of these bedbugs
is still alive.

17:30.341 --> 17:31.908
(croaking)

17:31.942 --> 17:34.310
(sighs) Much better.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.179

17:52.680 --> 17:54.414

18:22.209 --> 18:23.993

18:24.027 --> 18:28.181
(crowd screaming and gasping)

18:28.215 --> 18:31.534
Ow! He took my contact!

18:31.568 --> 18:33.820
Aah! Now I got two in one eye!

18:33.854 --> 18:35.705
(croaking, people yelling
and screaming)

18:35.723 --> 18:38.207
Remember you said,
"When hell freezes over?"

18:38.225 --> 18:40.326
I think this
is close enough.

18:40.361 --> 18:42.996
Huh. I'm in no
position to argue.

18:43.030 --> 18:44.430

18:45.716 --> 18:48.117

18:58.962 --> 19:00.396
What should we do?

19:00.414 --> 19:01.831
We need guidance.

19:01.865 --> 19:03.232
I have a plan.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.934
Save your civic leaders.

19:04.968 --> 19:07.403
Calm yourselves.
In times like this,

19:07.438 --> 19:10.356
there's one almighty being
we can put our faith in--

19:10.391 --> 19:11.841
Reverend Hooper.

19:11.875 --> 19:13.710
It's okay, everyone.

19:13.744 --> 19:15.784
Who here has seen <i>The Blind Side</i>
with Sandy Bullock?

19:15.796 --> 19:17.213
Remember
when Big Mike was overwhelmed

19:17.247 --> 19:18.915
with scholarship offers?

19:18.949 --> 19:21.184
Well, that's kind of
how we are with these frogs.

19:21.218 --> 19:23.186
To hell with your references.

19:23.220 --> 19:24.387

19:24.421 --> 19:26.105
We're dying here.

Ribbet. Ribbet.

19:31.428 --> 19:33.296
Do something.

19:33.330 --> 19:35.298
Um, video games,
uh, Twitter.

19:35.332 --> 19:36.966
Uh, <i>How to Train Your Dragon.</i>

19:37.000 --> 19:39.001
<i>Fight Club.</i> Aah!

19:41.305 --> 19:44.440
The Lord is my Shepherd;
I shall not want.

19:44.475 --> 19:47.777
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

19:47.811 --> 19:50.780
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.583
He restoreth my soul.

19:53.617 --> 19:57.320
His words have soothed
the amphibious beasts!

19:59.089 --> 20:00.456

20:16.240 --> 20:17.440

20:22.813 --> 20:24.730
All right, we collected
all the personal information

20:24.765 --> 20:26.516

20:26.550 --> 20:28.284
Let's move on to
