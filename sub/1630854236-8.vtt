00:13.793 --> 00:15.344
<i>Previously on</i> Walker...

00:15.448 --> 00:17.241
<i>A happy Thanksgiving
to all who celebrate.</i>

00:17.344 --> 00:19.103
And this suit. Forgive me.

00:19.206 --> 00:21.586
Y'all know I prefer
robust holiday attire.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.310
Well, Grey Flag had other plans
for your wardrobe, I guess.

00:24.413 --> 00:26.344
Hey, um...

00:26.448 --> 00:29.448
What the hell was that earlier
with James, Grey Flag?

00:29.551 --> 00:31.758
We don't know what James knows
or doesn't know.

00:31.862 --> 00:33.000
We stick to our story.

00:33.103 --> 00:34.517
I don't know
who you're becoming,

00:34.620 --> 00:36.655
but it is not a good person,
and I don't like it.

00:36.758 --> 00:38.965
<i>My daughter is an adult now.</i>

00:39.068 --> 00:41.103
And she needs to take
responsibility for her actions.

00:41.206 --> 00:43.862
Okay, you know what? Enough. It
was August who threw the party.

00:43.965 --> 00:46.241
It was August who got
his sister thrown in jail.

00:46.344 --> 00:48.482
And it was August who lost
your liquor license.

00:48.586 --> 00:50.482
You don't have to be such
a bitch about it, Mawline.

00:50.586 --> 00:52.310
What the hell did you just say?

00:52.413 --> 00:53.931
Okay, hold on, would you, Daddy?
I'll handle this.

00:54.034 --> 00:55.517
Well, I guess you
better handle it, Cordell,

00:55.620 --> 00:57.655
- or by God, I will.
- Mama?

01:09.103 --> 01:11.310
Dad.

01:15.068 --> 01:16.137
Go.

01:16.241 --> 01:17.758
- Go get your grandfather.
- Okay.

01:17.862 --> 01:20.206
Get your grandfather right now!
Get Gramps!

01:20.310 --> 01:22.344
Gramps! Grampa! Grampa!

01:28.172 --> 01:29.931

she was just there...

What happened?

02:15.137 --> 02:16.413
Uh, we just found her outside.

02:16.517 --> 02:18.068
She was on the ground, unresponsive.

02:18.172 --> 02:19.586
All right, was anyone
with her when it happened?

02:19.689 --> 02:21.241
No, we just found her there.

02:21.344 --> 02:22.551
- She was laying there.
- Coming through!

02:22.655 --> 02:25.586
I need an IV, I need oxygen,

02:25.689 --> 02:27.448
I need vitals, I'm gonna
start a neuro check.

02:29.379 --> 02:30.862
All right,
she's gonna be all right.

02:30.965 --> 02:32.379
All right, let's go wait.

02:32.482 --> 02:33.896
- Let's go wait, okay?
- All right.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.896
Okay, ma'am?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.586
Ma'am?

02:37.689 --> 02:40.034
Can you do me a favor and
try to lift your arms for me?

02:40.137 --> 02:42.172
Let's see, okay.

02:42.275 --> 02:43.517
Right arm is unresponsive.

02:43.620 --> 02:45.655
Okay...

02:48.482 --> 02:50.000
- Uh, can you finish?
- Copy that.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.448
I'm sorry, sir, you can't be
in this room right now.

02:52.551 --> 02:54.413
- No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
- No, we need some space.

02:54.517 --> 02:57.275
I will come and get you
when we're done, please.

03:00.517 --> 03:02.620
Vitals are hooked up.

03:02.724 --> 03:03.793
IV?

03:12.793 --> 03:14.482
- Dad.
- What happened?

03:14.586 --> 03:16.137
- Is Mawline okay?
- Stella.

03:16.241 --> 03:17.379
Uh, hey. Hey, hey.

03:17.482 --> 03:19.310
We don't know yet, okay?

03:19.413 --> 03:21.448
She's, she's in there
with them still.

03:21.551 --> 03:23.275
Augie, hey, buddy, come here.

03:23.379 --> 03:25.344
Come here.

03:25.448 --> 03:27.172
Don't worry, all right?
Don't worry.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.793
She's gonna be all right.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.206
Hi, I'm Dr. Woodward.

03:32.310 --> 03:34.241
- I'm treating Abeline.
- What happened?

03:34.344 --> 03:36.517
Abeline suffered a transient
ischemic attack.

03:36.620 --> 03:39.620
- What does that mean?
- A T.I.A. is a temporary stroke.

03:39.724 --> 03:41.172
In Abeline's case, a mild one.

03:41.275 --> 03:43.275
Okay, uh, so, uh...

03:43.379 --> 03:45.068
What's her prognosis
moving forward?

03:45.172 --> 03:47.586
There's no lasting brain damage
or residual symptoms.

03:47.689 --> 03:50.241
Looks like it resolved itself.

03:50.344 --> 03:52.931
I do recommend rest,
an aspirin regimen,

03:53.034 --> 03:55.379
stress management,
and a heart-healthy diet.

03:56.482 --> 03:58.068
She's gonna be okay.

03:58.172 --> 03:59.965
Thank you.

04:00.068 --> 04:01.517
Yeah, thank you.
Uh, can we visit?

04:01.620 --> 04:02.551
- Absolutely.
- Great.

04:02.655 --> 04:03.965
But one at a time, please.

04:04.068 --> 04:05.448
All right, all right.

04:05.551 --> 04:07.586
- Go, go, go. Go, Dad.
- Come with me.

04:07.689 --> 04:09.551
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

04:33.206 --> 04:35.517
This mattress was
made in a quarry.

04:36.448 --> 04:38.034
How you doing, darlin'?

04:38.137 --> 04:40.000
I'm a little tired.

04:40.103 --> 04:43.172
The tests they ran
even need to be tested.

04:43.275 --> 04:46.000
And imaged and the whole nine.

04:46.103 --> 04:48.241
We're all just...

04:48.344 --> 04:50.586
so happy that you're okay.

04:50.689 --> 04:52.413
Boys are in the waiting room

04:52.517 --> 04:54.413
with the kids and...

04:54.517 --> 04:56.068
And the doctor said
you're gonna be back

04:56.172 --> 04:58.379
to your normal self in no time.

05:00.620 --> 05:03.344
Do you remember
the first time we came here?

05:04.241 --> 05:06.034
When Cordell was born?

05:06.137 --> 05:07.655
No.

05:07.758 --> 05:09.344
We were still dating.

05:09.448 --> 05:11.758
It was one
of your early attempts

05:11.862 --> 05:14.137
to woo me
with your homemade spaghetti

05:14.241 --> 05:16.034
and giant meatballs.

05:16.137 --> 05:19.000
Which were severely undercooked.

05:21.413 --> 05:22.965
Hence, our-our visit.

05:23.068 --> 05:24.448
Oh, the good ol' days.

05:24.551 --> 05:26.931
Don't do that.

05:27.034 --> 05:28.379
Don't talk about the past
like we don't have

05:28.482 --> 05:30.344
much of a future, Abby.

05:35.034 --> 05:37.448
I just meant
I love and appreciate

05:37.551 --> 05:39.827
all the times
that we've had together.

05:41.034 --> 05:43.758
Well, then, you bash
my cooking some other time.

05:45.482 --> 05:46.827
Right now, you get some rest.

05:46.931 --> 05:48.413
All right?
Or you're gonna be laying

05:48.517 --> 05:50.241
in this rock-hard bed forever.

05:50.344 --> 05:52.068
I'm here.

06:07.448 --> 06:09.413
Barnett?

06:11.413 --> 06:14.137
Appreciate that. Hey, Cap.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.172
- Hey.
- Any news on Abby?

06:16.275 --> 06:18.103
Yeah, I just talked to Walker.

06:18.206 --> 06:19.379
Either she's released today,

06:19.482 --> 06:21.034
or there was
a promise of bodily harm.

06:21.137 --> 06:23.241
Yeah,
that sounds like her.

06:23.344 --> 06:25.344
Yeah, yeah.

06:25.448 --> 06:27.137
So Walker's gonna be
out of the office

06:27.241 --> 06:28.896
in the next few days
helping her recover.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
I need you
to work a case with Perez.

06:31.103 --> 06:33.137
Okay. All right, cool.

06:33.241 --> 06:35.482
Do you want me to get
the details from Cass?

06:35.586 --> 06:37.586
No. No, the opposite actually.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.551
You're gonna fill her in.

06:39.655 --> 06:42.000
You know
who Victor Ziff is, right?

06:42.103 --> 06:43.862
Yeah, the tech dude.
Big personality?

06:43.965 --> 06:45.586
- The one and only.
- What about him?

06:45.689 --> 06:47.689
He's missing.
Left his cell phone behind,

06:47.793 --> 06:49.655
hasn't made any contact.
He just kind of...

06:49.758 --> 06:51.068
dropped off
the face of the Earth.

06:51.172 --> 06:52.482
Troopers suspect foul play.

06:52.586 --> 06:54.896
Well, I could think
of a billion reasons why.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.724
- Any leads?
- His wife, Madison Ziff.

06:57.827 --> 06:59.034
Right before he disappeared,

06:59.137 --> 07:00.620
several bank accounts
were drained.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.655
Her lawyers have built
a wall around her.

07:02.758 --> 07:04.896
She's, she's not talking.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.379
So I want you and Perez
to start by looking into

07:07.482 --> 07:08.758
where she could have
hid the money.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.344
Then we can make an arrest.

07:10.448 --> 07:11.793
Try to get her to confess.

07:11.896 --> 07:13.448
- All right?
- Yeah.

07:13.551 --> 07:15.517
Cap, you good?

07:17.310 --> 07:19.862
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

07:20.724 --> 07:22.793
Just follow the money.

07:22.896 --> 07:25.620
Yes, sir.

07:26.689 --> 07:28.379
Hey, Trey?

07:28.482 --> 07:30.275
Look, besides the fact
that we're dealing with a...

07:30.379 --> 07:32.000
high-profile missing person,

07:32.103 --> 07:34.344
things around here have
gotten a little...

07:34.448 --> 07:36.758
lax lately.

07:36.862 --> 07:38.689
I need to know that I can trust

07:38.793 --> 07:40.793
and count on
my Rangers, Barnett.

07:40.896 --> 07:43.448
So I want this done by the book.
I expect you to follow

07:43.551 --> 07:45.758
not only the spirit
of the law but also the letter.

07:45.862 --> 07:47.241
- You got it?
- Yeah.

07:47.344 --> 07:50.241
And check in with me
before you make any moves.

07:50.344 --> 07:52.103
You got it, Cap.

07:52.206 --> 07:54.068
Ranger Perez.

07:57.896 --> 08:00.379
Hey. What was that about?

08:00.482 --> 08:02.655
I'll fill you in on the way.

08:06.689 --> 08:08.655
All right, here we go.
Easy, easy, easy.

08:08.758 --> 08:10.206
- Easy.
- Okay, guys.

08:10.310 --> 08:12.344
I have lived here for...

08:12.448 --> 08:13.896
Well, long enough to know

08:14.000 --> 08:15.862
where every step is,
so I got it.

08:15.965 --> 08:18.655
Okay, don't be
a bad patient, Mom.

08:18.758 --> 08:21.793
Well, just slow.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.620
- Look at these.
- All right.

08:26.724 --> 08:29.379
These are TEDs.

08:29.482 --> 08:31.482
For what?

08:31.586 --> 08:32.758
They're compression socks.

08:32.862 --> 08:34.965
I know what they are,
honey, I just...

08:35.068 --> 08:37.448
Unless you're taking me
to Paris...

08:37.551 --> 08:38.827
is this really necessary?

08:38.931 --> 08:41.310
Well, they may
look funny, but...

08:42.310 --> 08:44.586
They're supposed
to be good for hypertension.

08:44.689 --> 08:46.827
Would you just please

08:46.931 --> 08:48.827
wear the damn things?

08:54.034 --> 08:56.551
I hear that they're beneficial?

08:56.655 --> 08:59.000
- I don't know just... humor him.
- Okay, fine.

08:59.103 --> 09:02.000
But I'm... you know,
I'm gonna wash them first.

09:02.103 --> 09:04.103
Oh, will you please thank Ben

09:04.206 --> 09:05.758
for these flowers?

09:05.862 --> 09:07.551
Yeah, you know, I forgot that
I told him that your favorite

09:07.655 --> 09:09.379
flowers were zinnias, but

09:09.482 --> 09:11.862
he remembered.

09:11.965 --> 09:13.172
You two seem good.

09:13.275 --> 09:15.551
Well, we...
we had one hell

09:15.655 --> 09:17.103
of a first
Thanksgiving together.

09:17.206 --> 09:18.413
God Almighty.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.655
Yeah.

09:21.620 --> 09:22.862
What the...? What...?

09:22.965 --> 09:24.448
Wait. Wh... I'm going.

09:24.551 --> 09:25.758
I can go, okay?

09:29.206 --> 09:30.551
Dad.

09:30.655 --> 09:32.000
What are you doing?

09:32.103 --> 09:34.137
Why does everything have
to be drowned in salt?

09:34.241 --> 09:35.448
To make it taste better.

09:35.551 --> 09:39.103
Well, low sodium
helps reduce the risk of...

09:39.206 --> 09:40.827
A stroke?

09:40.931 --> 09:42.862
You can say the word, Bonham.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.413
Honey, could you give us
a second?

09:46.517 --> 09:48.000
Yeah.

09:49.103 --> 09:51.103
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

09:59.586 --> 10:01.241
What's that?

10:01.344 --> 10:04.862
Well, I-I know everyone's still
a little shook up, but, um,

10:04.965 --> 10:07.000
in the spirit of change,

10:07.103 --> 10:09.241
I think it's time
that we discuss a hard topic.

10:09.344 --> 10:11.862
Absolutely not.
We already have a will.

10:11.965 --> 10:14.827
I know. But it hasn't
been updated in ages.

10:14.931 --> 10:16.344
And we have
a lot more stuff now.

10:16.448 --> 10:18.103
And two grandkids. And...

10:18.206 --> 10:20.551
we almost lost it all
in a damn horse race.

10:20.655 --> 10:24.482
So could we please just make it
a little more official?

10:24.586 --> 10:26.448
So things go to the right place.

10:26.551 --> 10:27.827
Oh. Um...

10:27.931 --> 10:29.517
my mother's jewelry,

10:29.620 --> 10:30.931
I'd like Stella to have that.

10:31.034 --> 10:33.172
And the piano-- August.

10:33.275 --> 10:36.310
I mean, reminiscing on the past
at the hospital.

10:36.413 --> 10:38.551
Now you're talking about what's
gonna happen after you die?

10:38.655 --> 10:40.206
I don't...

10:40.310 --> 10:43.344
I don't want to talk
about that stuff, Abeline.

10:43.448 --> 10:44.793
No, I'm-I'm-I'm serious.

10:44.896 --> 10:47.620
Please, just don't push it.

10:55.172 --> 10:56.310
Excuse me.

11:06.448 --> 11:08.000
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

11:11.448 --> 11:13.000
Um...

11:15.034 --> 11:16.827
I'm sorry, Mawline.

11:18.103 --> 11:21.517
I d... I... I don't know how
to tell you how sorry I am.

11:21.620 --> 11:23.379
- But I...
- I don't believe

11:23.482 --> 11:25.689
that you actually meant
to say what you did.

11:25.793 --> 11:27.103
I didn't. I didn't. I swear.

11:27.206 --> 11:28.965
I was just so mad at myself
for everything

11:29.068 --> 11:31.758
and then I said it and then...

11:31.862 --> 11:33.172
you, uh...

11:33.275 --> 11:34.724
What?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.793
You think you caused that?

11:38.689 --> 11:40.310
You are a good person

11:40.413 --> 11:43.586
who just seems to be
a little lost right now.

11:43.689 --> 11:45.689
Lashing out like you did,

11:45.793 --> 11:48.068
I don't think
that is the right path.

11:49.103 --> 11:50.172
But...

11:50.275 --> 11:52.172
you're finding
your own way back.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.137
And we all say things
that we regret.

12:01.827 --> 12:03.793
What you're feeling...

12:05.000 --> 12:06.586
...means you got a good ticker.

12:06.689 --> 12:08.275
Okay?

12:10.620 --> 12:11.517
Okay.

12:11.620 --> 12:13.034
Come here.

12:20.551 --> 12:22.413
Now, honey, would you take that
into the kitchen?

12:22.517 --> 12:24.310
- I want to talk to your dad.
- Yeah.

12:25.827 --> 12:27.931
Mama.

12:29.413 --> 12:30.482
Did he apologize?

12:30.586 --> 12:31.586
Mm-hmm.

12:31.689 --> 12:33.206
Okay. Okay.

12:33.310 --> 12:34.862
Well, that's good.
That's a start.

12:34.965 --> 12:37.517
Uh, but that boy's punishment
is far from over.

12:37.620 --> 12:39.103
Wait, hold on.

12:39.206 --> 12:41.206
Before you make him go rebuild
the barn on his own,

12:41.310 --> 12:44.551
I would like you
to take the kids to Dallas.

12:44.655 --> 12:46.586
Dallas? Mama...

12:47.379 --> 12:51.103
Now's not really the best time
for a road trip.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.103
I want to see my brother.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.931
You haven't talked
to Uncle Willie

12:56.034 --> 12:58.206
in-in, what, like, 20 years?
More?

12:58.310 --> 12:59.965
I call him every Thanksgiving.

13:00.068 --> 13:02.724
Right, right.
And he never picks up.

13:02.827 --> 13:07.448
Uh, Mama, I think
it's time <i>he</i> showed some effort.

13:07.551 --> 13:08.896
He's stubborn.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.137
Yeah.

13:11.241 --> 13:12.413
But...

13:13.413 --> 13:14.517
...go talk to him.

13:14.620 --> 13:16.137
I mean, I'd go myself,
but your...

13:16.241 --> 13:18.551
father would put me
in a full compression suit.

13:18.655 --> 13:20.448
So,

13:20.551 --> 13:22.241
please, Cordell,

13:22.344 --> 13:24.379
see if he'll come for a visit.

13:32.517 --> 13:34.689
<i>♪ Out on the road,
ridin' all night...♪</i>

13:34.793 --> 13:36.551
Hey, y'all know that, uh,

13:36.655 --> 13:40.793
your Uncle Liam is named after
my Uncle Will?

13:40.896 --> 13:42.862
Willie. William. Liam. You know?

13:43.689 --> 13:46.206
Why would Mawline do that
if they don't like each other?

13:47.068 --> 13:49.034
Well, you know,
they-they were on better terms

13:49.137 --> 13:51.172
when Liam was born, so, uh...

13:51.275 --> 13:53.206
Yeah, until he became
the black sheep.

13:53.965 --> 13:54.862
I can relate.

13:54.965 --> 13:55.896
All right, Augie,

13:56.000 --> 13:56.896
y-you're not the black sheep.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Yeah, tell that to Gramps.

13:58.103 --> 13:59.862
Your Gramps is just hurt, okay?

13:59.965 --> 14:02.413
He's a bit more old-school.
You know?

14:02.517 --> 14:05.275
You-you mess with him,
he'll forget by sundown.

14:05.379 --> 14:07.379
You mess with someone
my daddy loves...

14:07.482 --> 14:09.586
You'll understand
when you're married.

14:17.896 --> 14:20.000
Stella.

14:21.793 --> 14:23.551
Hey. You in there?

14:23.655 --> 14:25.551
Oh! What is your problem?

14:25.655 --> 14:26.931
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

14:27.034 --> 14:27.965
I just need a cord
so I can charge my phone.

14:28.068 --> 14:28.965
Do you have it?

14:29.068 --> 14:30.344
No, I don't have it.

14:30.448 --> 14:31.586
Okay.

14:31.689 --> 14:32.827
That's all you had to say.

14:32.931 --> 14:35.379
Now go back to being emo
or whatever.

14:35.482 --> 14:38.068
We wouldn't even be on this
road trip if it wasn't for you.

14:38.172 --> 14:40.000
Ah, I forgot.
You are the favorite.

14:40.103 --> 14:41.724
And Gramps gave you
a list of things to say

14:41.827 --> 14:42.793
to remind me to hate myself?

14:42.896 --> 14:44.137
Yes, actually.

14:44.241 --> 14:45.827
Number one,
this is all Augie's fault.

14:45.931 --> 14:47.517
Number two,
you are too reckless.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.103
- I'm reckless?
- Yes!
- Guys.

14:49.206 --> 14:50.068
Says the one
who brought her little brother

14:50.172 --> 14:51.620
<i>to steal Dad's car.</i>

14:51.724 --> 14:53.137
<i>- All right.
- Oh, come on,</i>

14:53.241 --> 14:54.724
<i>you practically
begged me to come.</i>

14:54.827 --> 14:56.689
<i>- Guys.
- That was your choice.</i>

14:56.793 --> 14:58.482
<i>- No, it was not my choice.
- This is gonna be a nice trip!</i>

14:58.586 --> 15:00.137
It's not like you've never made
a bad choice, Stella.

15:00.241 --> 15:01.724
You almost became
Mrs. Trevor West, 'member that?

15:01.827 --> 15:03.379
How can you even say
something like that

15:03.482 --> 15:05.103
after what we went through
together?

15:05.206 --> 15:06.379
This is what I am saying!

15:06.482 --> 15:08.068
You are not even hearing
yourself anymore!

15:08.172 --> 15:10.275
Right, I'm so sorry
I forgot to run everything

15:10.379 --> 15:11.965
through the "will this upset
Stella?" filter.

15:12.068 --> 15:13.482
I am sorry
that you feel like an ass

15:13.586 --> 15:15.448
for putting Mawline
in the hospital,

15:15.551 --> 15:17.172
but that is nobody's fault
but yours!

15:17.275 --> 15:19.137
You're such a toad, Stella.

15:19.241 --> 15:20.793
What did you just say?!

15:20.896 --> 15:22.344
- You heard me loud and clear.
- Okay, no, no, no, no, no,

15:22.448 --> 15:24.000
- no, no, no, no.
- What did you just call me?

15:26.482 --> 15:28.275
Okay, no. No.

15:28.931 --> 15:30.034
Out.

15:30.137 --> 15:32.103
Uh, Dad, what--
what do you mean?

15:32.206 --> 15:34.862
I mean get out of the car. Now.

15:34.965 --> 15:37.000
You're walking.

15:41.413 --> 15:43.103
How long are we supposed
to walk for?

15:43.206 --> 15:45.965
Uh, well, the bed-and-breakfast
is about three miles from here.

15:46.068 --> 15:49.344
Should be long enough for you
two to get over yourselves.

16:10.172 --> 16:11.034
Hmm.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.103
This is a nice campus.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.793
Madison teaches here?

16:14.896 --> 16:16.172
Yep. Non-Western History.

16:16.275 --> 16:17.586
Hmm. That's random.

16:17.689 --> 16:19.758
I'd rather just sit
and count my billions.

16:19.862 --> 16:21.172
Yeah.

16:22.034 --> 16:23.413
Well, while we wait,

16:23.517 --> 16:25.862
- how's your love life going?
Hmm?
- Aw.

16:25.965 --> 16:27.827
Making dry January

16:27.931 --> 16:29.068
a year-round thing?

16:29.172 --> 16:30.379
Okay.

16:30.482 --> 16:33.000
A, that is not
what "dry January" means.

16:33.103 --> 16:35.137
And B, I'm doing just fine,

16:35.241 --> 16:36.517
- thank you very much.
- Mm-hmm.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.827
Mm.

16:37.931 --> 16:39.137
So, how's my man Kevin doing?

16:39.241 --> 16:41.379
- Oh, no. Don't start.
- Uh, oh, yeah.

16:41.482 --> 16:43.241
I heard you two just disappeared
into the night.

16:43.344 --> 16:44.931
Oh, please. No.

16:45.034 --> 16:47.517
My brother took off
in my car. We were stranded

16:47.620 --> 16:48.931
- and...
- Oh, you were stranded.

16:49.034 --> 16:50.379
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's not like we...

16:51.620 --> 16:53.103
Oh.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.896
Ranger Barnett. Ranger Perez.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.827
Um, this is one of my attorneys.

16:59.931 --> 17:03.172
- Just one? Huh.
- He doesn't think that I
should be talking to you at all.

17:03.275 --> 17:04.586
Look, I just want
to get this over with.

17:04.689 --> 17:06.620
I have no idea
what happened to Victor.

17:06.724 --> 17:08.931
As you told
the original investigator.

17:09.034 --> 17:10.172
Yes. And I also told him

17:10.275 --> 17:11.586
that there's no reason for me

17:11.689 --> 17:13.206
to be involved
in his disappearance.

17:13.310 --> 17:16.000
Victor and I ended things
a long time ago.

17:16.758 --> 17:19.586
And yet you're still running
his foundation.

17:20.586 --> 17:22.931
<i>We</i> started that company.

17:23.034 --> 17:24.241
Together.

17:25.275 --> 17:26.896
That's been the hardest part.

17:27.517 --> 17:28.896
What do you mean by that?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.275
We were getting a divorce.

17:30.379 --> 17:31.620
Pretty straightforward, but...

17:31.724 --> 17:34.379
the cost of my freedom
is our company.

17:34.482 --> 17:36.551
So you don't know anything about
the accounts being emptied?

17:36.655 --> 17:38.103
No, I don't.

17:38.206 --> 17:40.275
And if you're going where
I think you are, don't bother.

17:40.379 --> 17:42.862
Victor and I already reached
a settlement.

17:43.620 --> 17:45.655
I'd really advise that
we don't talk about numbers.

17:45.758 --> 17:47.620
As a matter of fact, Madison,
we should really get going.

17:47.724 --> 17:49.724
- We're gonna have
more questions for you.
- Fine.

17:49.827 --> 17:51.448
Submit them to my office

17:51.551 --> 17:54.517
and we'll see if we can make
Mrs. Ziff available to respond.

17:54.620 --> 17:55.793
We're good here.

17:55.896 --> 17:57.206
Let's go.

18:00.172 --> 18:01.620
My husband...

18:01.724 --> 18:04.310
wasn't the man
that you think he was.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.000
- You catch that?
- Yeah.

18:08.103 --> 18:10.517
- She referred to him
in the past tense.
- Mm-hmm.

18:12.137 --> 18:13.482
What are you doing?

18:13.586 --> 18:15.931
Cap said
he wanted real-time updates.

18:16.034 --> 18:17.689
He told you that? Not me?

18:30.758 --> 18:32.413
Uh, where's Dad?

18:32.517 --> 18:34.137
<i>♪ Here comes my coat♪</i>

18:34.241 --> 18:36.275
<i>♪ I stop to see
the mystery lights...♪</i>

18:36.379 --> 18:37.551
Hi.

18:37.655 --> 18:38.793
- We're looking for...
- No vacancy.

18:38.896 --> 18:40.827
Especially for you.

18:40.931 --> 18:42.689
Wait, what?

18:42.793 --> 18:44.275
Look, Lucy,

18:44.379 --> 18:46.896
I don't take monopoly money
as payment,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.689
and I don't have time for this,

18:49.793 --> 18:51.034
whatever it is.

18:51.137 --> 18:53.896
So why don't you
and dirty little Linus here

18:54.000 --> 18:56.241
just get out
of my bed-and-breakfast, okay?

18:56.344 --> 18:57.448
What did you just say?

18:57.551 --> 18:59.000
You heard me. Beat it.

18:59.103 --> 19:00.551
No. Who do you think you are?

19:00.655 --> 19:02.206
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

19:02.310 --> 19:03.655
All right, all right.
Stella, let's just-- Come on.

19:03.758 --> 19:04.862
Let's just go
and try to find Dad.

19:04.965 --> 19:06.137
It's fine.

19:06.241 --> 19:08.068
Here's my dad now.

19:08.172 --> 19:09.413
He's a Texas Ranger.

19:09.517 --> 19:10.827
It's okay, Stella. It's okay.

19:12.379 --> 19:13.931
He knows who I am.

19:14.034 --> 19:16.448
Augie, Stella,

19:16.551 --> 19:19.655
say hello to your
Granduncle Willie.

19:25.344 --> 19:27.034
Uncle Willie.

19:27.137 --> 19:30.172
Right, right. Forgot you
don't like to be touched.

19:30.275 --> 19:31.413
I'm sorry.
It's been a long time.

19:31.517 --> 19:33.344
These are your kids?

19:33.448 --> 19:34.827
They sure are.

19:34.931 --> 19:36.172
Yeah. Figures.

19:36.275 --> 19:37.724
Like I said,

19:37.827 --> 19:39.379
no vacancy.

19:39.482 --> 19:41.241
Well,

19:41.344 --> 19:44.275
would you like to know why
I'm here after all these years?

19:44.379 --> 19:47.965
Well, Abeline's work,
I'd imagine.

19:48.068 --> 19:51.620
But I don't give a darn tootin',
really, so...

19:51.724 --> 19:55.551
Well, your sister had a TIA.
A, uh... a mini-stroke.

19:57.034 --> 19:58.344
She's gonna be okay.

19:58.448 --> 20:01.000
She's gonna be okay.
But she wants to see you.

20:01.103 --> 20:03.413
So she asked
the kids and I head up this way

20:03.517 --> 20:05.586
and invite you to come back
with us for a visit.

20:05.689 --> 20:07.344
Well, I'm, uh...

20:07.448 --> 20:10.344
I'm much too busy. So, sorry.

20:10.448 --> 20:12.000
He just told you
your sister is sick,

20:12.103 --> 20:13.448
and you're too busy?

20:13.551 --> 20:15.620
If Abbs wants to call me,

20:15.724 --> 20:17.586
she knows the number.

20:17.689 --> 20:18.931
She has called you.

20:19.034 --> 20:19.931
Every single Thanksgiving.

20:20.034 --> 20:21.034
But you don't pick up.

20:22.517 --> 20:24.724
What happened between us
goes back 20 years.

20:24.827 --> 20:26.931
You have no idea the kind
of pain she's caused me.

20:27.034 --> 20:28.758
So don't you dare

20:28.862 --> 20:30.586
- come in here and...
- I don't have any idea.
I don't know.

20:30.689 --> 20:33.689
But I do know that she wants
to have a relationship with you.

20:33.793 --> 20:34.689
A fresh start.

20:34.793 --> 20:36.172
If you'd like.

20:36.275 --> 20:39.482
And we actually, uh,
do have a room here under--

20:39.586 --> 20:41.137
here it us-- uh...

20:41.241 --> 20:42.413
Stella Blue.

20:42.517 --> 20:43.655
We'll be staying the night.

20:45.724 --> 20:47.827
So, if you change your mind

20:47.931 --> 20:49.482
about wanting to come back
with us for a visit,

20:49.586 --> 20:51.655
we leave in the morning.

20:56.793 --> 20:57.827
All right.

20:59.241 --> 21:01.000
Thank you.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.931
Let's get our bags.

21:04.034 --> 21:05.241
Oh. Uncle Willie.

21:06.896 --> 21:08.724
I like what you've done
with Meemaw's house.

21:10.275 --> 21:11.896
Looks good.

21:27.724 --> 21:30.379
I thought the doctor ordered you
to take it easy.

21:30.482 --> 21:32.793
It's a potato peeler, Bonham,
not a kettlebell.

21:32.896 --> 21:36.482
Okay. Well, could you put it
down for a second, please?

21:40.034 --> 21:42.413
- What's that?
- Well, I've been doing
some research,

21:42.517 --> 21:44.206
and this is
a holistic vitapak.

21:44.310 --> 21:46.275
I want you to start a regimen.

21:46.379 --> 21:48.000
It's good stuff, Abeline.

21:48.103 --> 21:50.793
It's-- It-it dates back
to ancient China. You see...

21:50.896 --> 21:51.827
that big one there,

21:51.931 --> 21:53.517
that's-that's colloidal silver.

21:53.620 --> 21:56.965
Comes in a pill now, I guess.

21:57.068 --> 21:58.379
Go on.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.379
Why aren't you wearing
your TEDs?

22:01.482 --> 22:02.931
Okay, that's it.

22:03.034 --> 22:05.068
Sit down. Please?

22:11.448 --> 22:13.448
I can't stop living
a normal life

22:13.551 --> 22:17.413
just because you think
that any misstep

22:17.517 --> 22:19.413
will land me back
in the hospital.

22:19.517 --> 22:22.655
It's also awfully hypocritical.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.655
- Meaning what?
- I seem to remember

22:25.758 --> 22:28.655
you handled your cancer
diagnosis pretty privately,

22:28.758 --> 22:32.413
till I found out,
at gunpoint.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.965
- Mm.
- And why is it that,
you know,

22:34.068 --> 22:36.000
you want me to try
your vitapak,

22:36.103 --> 22:38.724
but you won't even broach
the subject of our will?

22:38.827 --> 22:40.379
Now, I think it's really sweet

22:40.482 --> 22:41.758
that you are going
the extra mile for me,

22:41.862 --> 22:45.551
but maybe dial it down
a notch.

22:45.655 --> 22:48.137
And one more thing.

22:48.241 --> 22:50.000
Take it easy on August.

22:51.344 --> 22:54.379
- He didn't cause my stroke.
- I know that.

22:54.482 --> 22:57.586
But you were almost
taken from me.

22:58.586 --> 23:01.862
So you want me to ease up? Fine.

23:01.965 --> 23:05.517
But don't ask me to make plans
for after you're gone.

23:05.620 --> 23:08.448
That's asking too much.

23:14.413 --> 23:17.551
This is Mr. Ziff's office

23:17.655 --> 23:21.241
Here, I can access
his computer for you.

23:21.344 --> 23:22.689
<i>-
Welcome to Ziff Enterprises.</i>
- Wow.

23:22.793 --> 23:25.379
<i>Welcome to your future.</i>

23:25.482 --> 23:27.793
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

23:28.758 --> 23:31.827
- Are you gonna find him?
- We're gonna try.

23:37.896 --> 23:39.689
Hey.

23:41.034 --> 23:42.724
What would you do with
$7 billion?

23:42.827 --> 23:45.379
That's easy.
I'd buy the Red Socks.

23:45.482 --> 23:47.068
What about you?

23:47.172 --> 23:49.517
I would buy an island

23:49.620 --> 23:52.137
- in St. Lucia.
- Okay.

23:52.241 --> 23:54.586
Oh, here's something.

23:54.689 --> 23:56.172
Trade secrets of a guru.

23:56.275 --> 23:57.448
Ziff's assets.

23:57.551 --> 23:59.310
Wow, looks like he owned
half the city.

23:59.413 --> 24:04.137
He's bought and sold dozens
of condos, office buildings.

24:04.241 --> 24:07.068
He could have had his own
house-flipping show. Hmm.

24:07.172 --> 24:08.344
Oh, except that one.

24:08.448 --> 24:09.517
He couldn't sell that one.

24:09.620 --> 24:12.137
- Wait, pull that up.
- Mm-hmm.

24:14.551 --> 24:16.620
All these
multi-million-dollar listings,

24:16.724 --> 24:19.517
and Ziff buys a warehouse
that makes futons.

24:19.620 --> 24:21.103
Love a good futon.

24:21.206 --> 24:23.344
He sells all the other ones,
but he keeps this one.

24:23.448 --> 24:24.758
Huh.

24:24.862 --> 24:27.000
Well, there you go,
that's why.

24:27.103 --> 24:28.448
He couldn't sell it.

24:28.551 --> 24:30.827
It was red-tagged by the city.
Structural damage.

24:30.931 --> 24:32.793
Okay, so the Ziffs own
a warehouse that

24:32.896 --> 24:34.379
- they can't use or sell.
- Mm.

24:34.482 --> 24:36.413
That sounds like
the perfect place

24:36.517 --> 24:38.931
to bury a body to me.

24:40.689 --> 24:43.206
Yeah.

24:43.310 --> 24:45.551
Hey, partner, how's Dallas?

24:45.655 --> 24:47.000
<i>Uh...</i>

24:47.103 --> 24:49.206
well, could be better,
you know, could be worse.

24:49.310 --> 24:51.000
I got your text.
What's up?

24:51.103 --> 24:55.103
- Um, have you spoken
to Captain James today?
<i>- No.</i>

24:55.206 --> 24:58.689
I-I tried to check in,
just got his voicemail. Why?

24:58.793 --> 25:01.965
He seems buggy.
You think he suspects anything?

25:02.068 --> 25:04.620
<i>He did tell me he wanted
to talk to me at Thanksgiving.</i>

25:04.724 --> 25:06.517
<i>He said he wanted to talk</i>

25:06.620 --> 25:08.172
to both of us.

25:08.275 --> 25:09.724
- Did he say anything else
to you?
<i>- No.</i>

25:09.827 --> 25:11.586
Opposite.
He's been cold,

25:11.689 --> 25:13.379
like he knows we lied.

25:13.482 --> 25:15.172
<i>Listen, we should really talk</i>

25:15.275 --> 25:16.931
- when you get back.
<i>- Yeah, look,</i>

25:17.034 --> 25:18.551
in the meantime,
I gotta get back to my kids

25:18.655 --> 25:20.344
and their battle royale.

25:20.448 --> 25:21.931
<i>Oof, good luck with that.</i>

25:22.034 --> 25:23.034
Thanks. Bye.

25:24.482 --> 25:25.482
- All right?
- Yeah.

25:25.586 --> 25:27.206
Yeah, let's go.

25:31.482 --> 25:33.620
All right, to the warehouse?

25:33.724 --> 25:36.344
You know what, let me
check in with Cap first.

25:36.448 --> 25:39.172
Well, let's just drive by
and see what we find.

25:39.275 --> 25:42.034
Sounds like something that
we're gonna need a warrant for.

25:42.137 --> 25:45.068
Relax. We're just going
for a drive.

25:45.172 --> 25:47.206
A warrant will take at least
a couple of days.

25:47.310 --> 25:49.620
Let's just get some eyes on it
so we don't waste our time.

25:49.724 --> 25:52.379
I don't know, Cass.
Cap was pretty adamant.

25:52.482 --> 25:53.724
Look, I'm your superior.

25:53.827 --> 25:55.068
If all else fails,
we'll just say that

25:55.172 --> 25:56.862
I brought you there
against your will.

25:56.965 --> 25:58.586
Hmm?

26:05.482 --> 26:07.172
Mmm.

26:13.758 --> 26:15.896
Okay, uh, all right.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
I know things have
seemed a bit, uh,

26:19.103 --> 26:22.482
heated recently,
but we're family,

26:22.586 --> 26:24.586
so let's talk it out.

26:24.689 --> 26:26.793
Who wants to go first?

26:31.827 --> 26:33.482
- Okay, I will.
- Why do you hate us?

26:33.586 --> 26:35.793
- Oh, my God.
- Well, that's the way
that it feels, Augie,

26:35.896 --> 26:37.206
like you don't want to be
a part of this family.

26:37.310 --> 26:38.482
Yeah, well,
you would know, right?

26:38.586 --> 26:40.137
You're the one who moved away.

26:40.241 --> 26:41.758
- And you were...
- No, no, no. Shh, shh.

26:41.862 --> 26:46.413
Let's-let's not start this
all over again.

26:46.517 --> 26:47.965
But let's...

26:50.275 --> 26:53.758
You know what, forget it. Just...

26:53.862 --> 26:56.275
do what y'all want.

27:00.689 --> 27:02.172
Yeah. Way to go.

27:02.275 --> 27:04.689
How do you not understand
that this is all your fault?

27:04.793 --> 27:06.137
Oh, whatever, toad.

27:11.103 --> 27:12.862
What?

27:12.965 --> 27:15.827
Do you know why you're
having such a hard time?

27:15.931 --> 27:17.413
Oh, I bet you're gonna tell me.

27:17.517 --> 27:20.482
What is it, my aggressiveness,
my recklessness? What?

27:20.586 --> 27:22.896
It's because you miss Mom.

27:24.275 --> 27:25.689
You wouldn't be acting like this
if she was here.

27:25.793 --> 27:26.965
Okay, you know what, Stella,

27:27.068 --> 27:28.482
you could say that
about anything.

27:28.586 --> 27:29.896
Do not bring Mom into this.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.482
She used to call you
her little toad.

27:31.586 --> 27:32.896
Do you remember that?

27:34.793 --> 27:36.241
You used to make
these little noises

27:36.344 --> 27:38.275
that sounded like a toad,

27:38.379 --> 27:41.206
so she started
to playfully call you one.

27:41.310 --> 27:45.379
No, I don't,
I don't remember that, Stella.

27:45.482 --> 27:47.965
I didn't either,
until you called me it.

27:48.068 --> 27:49.655
And then I realized.

27:49.758 --> 27:52.758
You said Dad favors me.

27:52.862 --> 27:55.724
That's the way that I felt
with you and Mom.

27:55.827 --> 27:59.620
Things just seemed easier
between you two.

27:59.724 --> 28:01.310
You were so close.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.724
Yeah.

28:03.827 --> 28:05.862
Yeah, she, uh...

28:07.379 --> 28:10.655
She made things make sense,
you know?

28:10.758 --> 28:13.655
Yeah, she was kind of great
at that.

28:13.758 --> 28:15.172
Yeah.

28:15.275 --> 28:17.482
What you're going through
right now,

28:17.586 --> 28:18.689
I've been there.

28:18.793 --> 28:21.896
And I know that
I'm not Mom,

28:22.000 --> 28:25.482
but if you need to vent
or just yell at someone,

28:25.586 --> 28:27.689
let me be that person.

28:28.655 --> 28:31.827
I'm a little less sacred than,
say, Mawline.

28:33.965 --> 28:36.862
Yeah, I really screwed up
with that one, huh?

28:36.965 --> 28:38.655
Yeah, but in
the grand scheme of things,

28:38.758 --> 28:40.344
I've probably done
a lot worse.

28:40.448 --> 28:42.586
Oh, yeah, like the time
you were caught with weed?

28:42.689 --> 28:46.068
Oh, please. Like you didn't
punch a guy and start a fight.

28:46.172 --> 28:48.965
Well, I mean, I-I ended
the fight, right?

28:54.068 --> 28:55.758
Whoa, the state
comptroller's office

28:55.862 --> 28:57.172
<i>just got back to us.</i>

28:57.275 --> 29:00.689
Looks like mogul Ziff was
in serious tax debt.

29:00.793 --> 29:03.689
Like headed to Club Fed
for evasion.

29:03.793 --> 29:05.206
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:05.310 --> 29:08.896
And they also found
large transfer payments

29:09.000 --> 29:10.793
traced back to Moldova.

29:10.896 --> 29:12.551
That's so random.

29:12.655 --> 29:15.827
Madison said he wasn't
who we thought he was.

29:16.551 --> 29:18.620
Maybe she figured out
what he was doing,

29:18.724 --> 29:21.241
and she took her cut
before Uncle Sam did.

29:22.931 --> 29:24.275
I think this is the address,
right here.

29:24.379 --> 29:26.827
Wait, did you hear that?

29:26.931 --> 29:28.793
What?

29:28.896 --> 29:30.241
- Gun.
- Wait. Wait, no, Cass.

29:30.344 --> 29:32.896
Cass, Cass, wait, wait.
Damn it!

29:33.000 --> 29:34.827
Dispatch, this is Barnett.

29:34.931 --> 29:36.586
Shots fired at our location.

29:36.689 --> 29:38.068
I'm gonna check it out
with Ranger Perez now.

30:07.241 --> 30:10.172
- Texas Rangers!
- Whoa! Whoa.

30:10.275 --> 30:12.758
It's a...
it's a toy.

30:12.862 --> 30:15.275
Victor Ziff.

30:15.379 --> 30:17.172
Alive and well, hmm?

30:17.275 --> 30:19.517
Guess I was right about the gun.

30:22.517 --> 30:25.655
- Technically, faking your death
isn't a crime.
- Mm.

30:25.758 --> 30:27.793
Anyway,
now that you've found me,

30:27.896 --> 30:29.344
can you please call
my assistants?

30:29.448 --> 30:31.517
We don't work for you,
Mr. Ziff.

30:31.620 --> 30:35.000
You play annoyed, detached,

30:35.103 --> 30:37.586
but I think you look like
a romantic.

30:37.689 --> 30:39.793
Do I, now?

30:39.896 --> 30:41.620
You care to explain these?

30:41.724 --> 30:42.931
Ooh.

30:47.068 --> 30:50.000
My Elena is waiting for me,
okay? In Moldova.

30:50.103 --> 30:52.965
She's why I did all of this.

30:53.068 --> 30:55.103
- Love.
- Love?

30:55.206 --> 30:58.137
Or is it that nine-figure sum
that you owe Uncle Sam?

30:58.241 --> 30:59.827
Oh, you definitely aren't
a romantic.

30:59.931 --> 31:01.965
You know what?

31:02.068 --> 31:04.724
The Feds will figure out
what to do with you.

31:04.827 --> 31:06.310
You have a good day.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.965
You a romantic?

31:13.310 --> 31:16.517
Not wrong, though.
Dry January.

31:16.620 --> 31:18.689
- Just saying.
- That's not what it means.

31:18.793 --> 31:21.448
That's what you think.

31:22.862 --> 31:25.655
Wait, hold on. Um...

31:25.758 --> 31:28.137
This morning at breakfast.

31:28.241 --> 31:31.344
- Dad...
- Thank you.

31:31.448 --> 31:36.655
I may have accidentally
eavesdropped on you

31:36.758 --> 31:38.000
talking with your brother.

31:38.103 --> 31:40.724
Well, I just don't want
to end up like

31:40.827 --> 31:42.551
Uncle Willie and Mawline.

31:44.724 --> 31:47.896
You know, your mother would be
very proud of you.

31:50.379 --> 31:53.000
Hey, how about we turn this
into a weekly thing?

31:53.103 --> 31:55.103
Oh, no, not-not this, exactly,

31:55.206 --> 31:58.551
but how about we start
with, uh, uh, Sunday dinners?

31:58.655 --> 32:01.758
- Okay.
- Yeah?

32:01.862 --> 32:03.517
- If you don't cook.
- But...

32:03.620 --> 32:05.620
I beg your pardon,
I am a great cook.

32:05.724 --> 32:07.275
Oh, do we need to talk about
the noodle incident?

32:07.379 --> 32:09.310
We'll talk about that later.

32:09.413 --> 32:11.310
There's an explanation.
Augie, hey, bud.

32:11.413 --> 32:15.137
- Uh, any luck?
- I knocked. No response.

32:16.827 --> 32:18.655
Okay.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.241
Hey, hey, hold up.

32:28.344 --> 32:30.620
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi.

32:31.689 --> 32:34.310
Ah, good think you don't
drive like your mother.

32:34.413 --> 32:37.896
Well, we're--
we're just heading out.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.655
Well, just hold your horses.

32:39.758 --> 32:42.448
God, y'all act like you've been
mistreated or something.

32:42.551 --> 32:45.172
- Actually...
- Uh, easy there, Pippi.

32:45.275 --> 32:47.172
I have something to say.

32:47.275 --> 32:50.103
Okay. We're all ears.

32:50.206 --> 32:53.172
I've been thinking about
what you said yesterday,

32:53.275 --> 32:56.586
and the truth is I...
I miss my sister.

32:56.689 --> 33:00.241
But I'm just not ready
to see her yet.

33:01.724 --> 33:03.103
I can respect that.

33:04.241 --> 33:06.137
But I will say
if this past week

33:06.241 --> 33:08.379
has taught me anything,
it's that we don't always

33:08.482 --> 33:10.655
have the time we think we do.

33:12.931 --> 33:15.103
You have your uncle's wisdom.

33:17.448 --> 33:18.517
I-I was talking about me.

33:18.620 --> 33:20.172
I-I know. I get that.

33:21.931 --> 33:25.172
Well, it was, it was really nice
meeting you two peanuts.

33:29.379 --> 33:31.241
Bye.

33:32.413 --> 33:34.000
Well...

33:34.724 --> 33:36.758
We tried, Dad.

33:36.862 --> 33:39.931
I think maybe Mawline
will be happy with that.

33:40.034 --> 33:42.275
Yeah. Yeah.

34:04.275 --> 34:06.689
Well, that didn't go
as expected.

34:06.793 --> 34:08.724
At least we saved an innocent
woman from going to prison.

34:08.827 --> 34:10.275
Mm. True.

34:10.379 --> 34:12.689
Think she'll buy me an island?

34:12.793 --> 34:15.344
Barnett, I told you
to check in with me

34:15.448 --> 34:16.689
before you did anything.
What the hell were you doing

34:16.793 --> 34:17.896
at Ziff's warehouse?

34:18.000 --> 34:19.275
Sir, I was
the ranking Ranger.

34:19.379 --> 34:20.965
- Am I talking to you?
- No, sir, but I...

34:21.068 --> 34:22.827
Then shut up.

34:22.931 --> 34:26.137
I gave you very simple,
very clear instructions.

34:26.241 --> 34:27.793
What, you couldn't follow 'em?

34:27.896 --> 34:29.931
- We heard gunshots.
- That's not the damn point!

34:30.034 --> 34:31.551
Yeah, but that's
probable cause, sir.

34:31.655 --> 34:34.034
For somebody so well-read
in SOP, how is it that you have

34:34.137 --> 34:36.448
no idea how to follow
a direct order?

34:37.689 --> 34:39.206
You know what?

34:40.724 --> 34:43.724
Maybe making you a Ranger
was a mistake.

35:02.103 --> 35:04.793
Hey. More chores?

35:04.896 --> 35:07.344
Just clothes.

35:07.448 --> 35:10.827
And I'm lifting one T-shirt
at a time, I promise.

35:10.931 --> 35:12.793
Sure.

35:12.896 --> 35:14.379
Uh, listen,
when you're finished,

35:14.482 --> 35:15.758
uh, dinner's ready.

35:15.862 --> 35:19.827
It's a healthy alternative
to the usual.

35:19.931 --> 35:22.551
I'm sorry, didn't we
just have this conversation?

35:22.655 --> 35:25.310
You were gonna ease up.
Remember?

35:25.413 --> 35:26.413
But, Abby, I...

35:26.517 --> 35:28.068
Okay, you are stressing me out.

35:28.172 --> 35:31.793
You know, yeah-- yes,
what happened to me was scary.

35:31.896 --> 35:33.103
I've admitted it.

35:33.206 --> 35:34.758
But if you think that
I'm gonna eat

35:34.862 --> 35:36.448
an all-lettuce diet,

35:36.551 --> 35:39.724
or take collodial...
whatever the hell,

35:39.827 --> 35:42.517
or wear any of
those monstrosities

35:42.620 --> 35:44.103
that come all the way
up to my knee,

35:44.206 --> 35:46.551
uh, thanks, but no thanks.

36:05.034 --> 36:07.758
Bo-Bonham? Um...

36:07.862 --> 36:09.551
There she is.

36:11.620 --> 36:15.241
<i>♪ I remember when
we used to run wild♪</i>

36:19.206 --> 36:22.241
<i>♪ Young and in love

36:22.344 --> 36:23.931
Abby, I heard what you said,

36:24.034 --> 36:29.275
and I recognize that
I-I may have gone overboard

36:29.379 --> 36:31.758
- with your recovery.
- Right.

36:32.827 --> 36:34.482
It's because I'm terrified
of the thought

36:34.586 --> 36:36.482
of continuing this life
without you in it.

36:36.586 --> 36:38.206
<i>♪ Things aren't the same now♪</i>

36:38.310 --> 36:42.172
That's been my biggest fear
since the day I said "I do."

36:42.275 --> 36:44.172
You don't need to worry.

36:44.275 --> 36:46.241
No, I...

36:46.344 --> 36:49.206
I now recognize
that those vows...

36:50.758 --> 36:52.551
...mean walking through
the difficult parts of life

36:52.655 --> 36:55.724
just like you do the...
the happy ones.

36:56.931 --> 37:00.551
And I've been the luckiest man
for so many years.

37:01.655 --> 37:02.896
I'd sure hate to ruin that

37:03.000 --> 37:05.310
by making you walk
on eggshells now.

37:05.413 --> 37:06.689
Well, good luck
with that, anyway.

37:06.793 --> 37:09.034
Yeah.

37:09.137 --> 37:11.448
Don't I know it.

37:11.551 --> 37:15.724
So tomorrow, I promise

37:15.827 --> 37:18.758
that I will discuss our will,

37:18.862 --> 37:20.586
and anything else
you want to talk about.

37:20.689 --> 37:23.724
No more fear
dictating our lives.

37:23.827 --> 37:28.482

- Oh, okay.

37:42.344 --> 37:45.413
So, uh, here.
Let me get this.

37:45.517 --> 37:49.517
Um, I made low-sodium marinara,

37:49.620 --> 37:53.551
and the noodles are whole wheat.

37:55.827 --> 37:58.931
And Liam made the meatballs,
just in case.

37:59.034 --> 38:00.862

38:00.965 --> 38:03.241

38:11.655 --> 38:12.862

38:12.965 --> 38:13.793
Hey.

38:13.896 --> 38:15.482
- Hi.
- There she is.

38:15.586 --> 38:18.103
I heard someone

38:18.206 --> 38:19.931
had quite the meal.

38:20.034 --> 38:22.724
Oh. Well, it turns out

38:22.827 --> 38:24.413
that healthy spaghetti is
just as good

38:24.517 --> 38:25.655
as the real thing.

38:25.758 --> 38:27.655
Okay, no, it's not.

38:27.758 --> 38:29.034
But, you know, I lived.

38:29.137 --> 38:30.448
So, how was Dallas?

38:30.551 --> 38:33.586
Dallas, yeah.
Dallas, um...

38:34.724 --> 38:36.551
We-we found Uncle Willie.

38:36.655 --> 38:39.793
But he's-he's not ready
to come down here

38:39.896 --> 38:42.931
for a visit just yet.
I'm sorry, Mama.

38:43.034 --> 38:44.275
That's all right.

38:44.379 --> 38:48.275
At least he got to meet
Stella and August.

38:48.379 --> 38:50.896
Yeah. Yeah.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.172
Speaking of which,
I know what you did

38:55.275 --> 38:57.448
sending them with me.

38:57.551 --> 39:00.206
- I don't know what you mean.
- Oh, really?

39:00.310 --> 39:01.862
Uh, got a feeling that, uh,

39:01.965 --> 39:04.724
grabbing ol' Uncle Willie
wasn't the point of the trip.

39:04.827 --> 39:07.482
Trip was about us, wasn't it?

39:07.586 --> 39:10.827
Maybe. Did it work?

39:10.931 --> 39:13.344
Yeah, it worked.

39:13.448 --> 39:15.103
Thank you.

39:19.206 --> 39:22.034
- It's my brother.
- Get it, get it. Answer it.

39:22.137 --> 39:23.931
Well, I-I don't know
what to say.

39:24.034 --> 39:26.103
You'll-you'll figure it out,
Mama. You always do

39:26.206 --> 39:27.413
Okay.

39:32.172 --> 39:35.103
William. Hi.

39:38.551 --> 39:39.793
It's open.

39:42.137 --> 39:43.172
Hey, Daddy.

39:43.275 --> 39:45.068
- Hey.
- Get you a beer?

39:45.172 --> 39:46.310
No, I'm good.

39:46.413 --> 39:49.241
All right.
Well, don't mind if I do.

39:49.344 --> 39:51.896
So, uh...

39:52.000 --> 39:53.724
...how's my lovely
brother-in-law?

39:53.827 --> 39:57.172
Ha-ha.
As described... uh, lovely.

39:57.275 --> 40:00.689
But I did just have
a nice talk with Mama.

40:00.793 --> 40:02.448
- She seems to be
in high spirits.
- Well...

40:02.551 --> 40:04.551
- You still got it, Romeo.
- Oh, yeah.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.793
Ah, that woman will
outlive us all.

40:08.896 --> 40:10.275
- I know she will.
- Cheers to that.

40:10.379 --> 40:11.827
Here's hoping she does.

40:11.931 --> 40:14.931
Listen, uh, I've been meaning
to talk to you.

40:15.034 --> 40:16.068
Yeah. Shoot.

40:16.172 --> 40:19.482
I've been thinking,
and, uh...

40:21.724 --> 40:25.172
Maybe it's time for
you and the kids

40:25.275 --> 40:26.965
to find a place of your own.

40:29.586 --> 40:32.413
Daddy, um...

40:32.517 --> 40:34.620
I-if this is about Mama,

40:34.724 --> 40:37.413
- we can help...
- No. No, it's not about that.

40:39.275 --> 40:42.000
She doesn't even know that I'm
here asking you, and that's...

40:42.827 --> 40:44.896
...that's a different fight
for a different day.

40:45.862 --> 40:48.172
No, this is about you, son.

40:48.275 --> 40:51.793
More pointedly,
it's-it's about your family.

40:51.896 --> 40:55.068
Now, Stella's already moved out,

40:55.172 --> 40:57.379
and this was,
this was always supposed to be

40:57.482 --> 40:58.896
a temporary thing.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.724
I'm not saying that
this has to happen tomorrow,

41:00.827 --> 41:05.724
but it's time you got
your house in order, son.

41:07.517 --> 41:10.172
In more ways than one.

41:12.931 --> 41:14.862
- You're probably right.
- Well,

41:14.965 --> 41:18.379
I'm often wrong,
but in this instance...
