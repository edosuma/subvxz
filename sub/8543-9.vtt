WELL, WE FOUND TIRE TRACKS
BY THE WATER'S EDGE, SO--

01:54.679 --> 01:56.812
WHICH MEANS HE WAS MURDERED
ELSEWHERE AND DUMPED HERE.

01:56.855 --> 01:58.683

PERHAPS THE OTHER ONE
WAS LOST IN THE SCUFFLE.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.366
WHY DUMP HIM ON A GOLF COURSE?

ABOUT IT FOR A WHILE.

19:33.955 --> 19:36.000
SHE BROKE THE LAW.

19:36.044 --> 19:38.307
I ALREADY CALLED THE D.A.
AND CHILD SERVICES.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.701
JUST LET 'EM GO HOME.

19:50.101 --> 19:52.495
GOT LEM'S PHONE RECORDS.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.149
HE HAD TWO CALLS
FROM A DISPOSABLE PHONE,

19:54.193 --> 19:56.586
ONE AT 8:15 P.M.
AND ONE AT 9:00 P.M.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.675
THE CALL AT 9:00
IS WITHIN OUR MURDER WINDOW.

19:58.719 --> 19:59.981
WELL, THAT MUST BE
OUR KILLER.

20:00.024 --> 20:02.549
TRY AND TRACK DOWN WHERE
THE CELL PHONE WAS SOLD.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.507
HEY, RIGSBY, DID THEY EVER
FIND THAT OTHER CUFFLINK

20:04.551 --> 20:06.509
AT THE COUNTRY CLUB?NO. THEY WENT THROUGH
THE WATER HAZARD

20:06.553 --> 20:08.381
WITH A VACUUM AND A SIFTER--
CAME BACK WITH NOTHING.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.861

20:26.877 --> 20:28.357

20:29.576 --> 20:32.361

SHE'S FREE TO GO FOR NOW.

20:32.405 --> 20:34.711

MORE AT THE PARTY.

22:15.856 --> 22:18.337
BECAUSE OF THE FORTIFICATION,
I'M THINKING THE FRONT DOOR

22:18.380 --> 22:19.729
IS THE BEST POINT OF ENTRY.

22:19.773 --> 22:21.688
CHO, YOU TAKE THE TWO SIDE.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.280
SOUNDS GOOD.

24:16.324 --> 24:18.674
RIGHT. [sighs]

24:21.024 --> 24:23.287
[door closes]

24:23.331 --> 24:24.985

I LIKE IT.

24:52.186 --> 24:54.667
GOOD. GOOD. LET'S TAKE
A LOOK AT THE EXTRA BEDROOM.

24:54.710 --> 24:55.798
NO. NO NEED.

24:55.842 --> 24:57.887
I'M REALLY FEELING IT HERE.

24:57.931 --> 24:59.367
YEAH.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.848
I THINK I NEED TO BE ALONE
WITH THE HOUSE FOR A MOMENT.

25:01.891 --> 25:04.633
YOU KNOW, JUST TO
CHECK OUT ITS AURA.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.548
AURA?

25:06.592 --> 25:08.202
YEAH.

25:08.245 --> 25:09.856
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA BUY
A HOUSE

25:09.899 --> 25:12.554
UNLESS WE HAVE
COMPATIBLE AURAS.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.514
OF COURSE.

25:15.557 --> 25:17.341
TEN MINUTES.

25:17.385 --> 25:20.693

25:46.632 --> 25:49.069
YEAH, WELL, SOME TAKE
LONGER THAN OTHERS.

25:49.112 --> 25:50.636
Playtime's over.

25:50.679 --> 25:52.768
WE FOUND LEM'S MISSING CAR.

25:52.812 --> 25:56.250
AH. THAT'S EXCELLENT.
[breathing heavily]

25:56.293 --> 26:07.130
BECAUSE I JUST FOUND
THE ROOM WHERE HE WAS MURDERED.

26:09.829 --> 26:13.267
[sighs, filtered voice]

26:13.310 --> 26:16.313
[filtered voice] SHADE.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.272
[normal voice] TELL ME HOW YOU
ENDED UP WITH A DEAD MAN'S CAR.

26:20.143 --> 26:21.623
IT SETTLED A DEBT.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.494
A DEBT.

26:23.538 --> 26:26.585
WELL, HE COST ME A LOT
OF MONEY WHEN HE JUMPED OUT.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.804
I MEAN, I WAS COOL.

26:28.848 --> 26:32.591
BUT HE STARTED FLEXING
WITH A VERY NICE RIDE THIS YEAR.

26:32.634 --> 26:35.506
SEE, HE OBVIOUSLY FORGOT
THAT I MADE HIM.

26:35.550 --> 26:37.247
SO I'M LIKE, "YO,

26:37.291 --> 26:39.423
I'M-A NEED A LITTLE MORE
RETURN ON MY INVESTMENT."

26:39.467 --> 26:41.121
NOW IS THIS WHEN YOU
BRUISED HIS STERNUM,

26:41.164 --> 26:43.079
OR ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
WHEN YOU FRACTURED HIS RIBS?

26:43.123 --> 26:45.473
[scoffs, filtered voice]
YOU'RE FUNNY.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.606
LET'S JUST SAY
HE AGREED WITH ME.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.216
[Cho, filtered voice]
UP UNTIL TWO NIGHTS AGO.

26:49.259 --> 26:51.914
LOOK, I JUST CALLED TO TELL HIM
THAT I NEED A LITTLE EXTRA.

26:51.958 --> 26:53.481
SEE, THESE CORNERS
AIN'T DOING WHAT THEY SHOULD

26:53.524 --> 26:54.743
IN THIS ECONOMY.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.310
[normal voice]
AT 8:15 AND 9:00 P.M.

26:56.353 --> 26:57.659
ON A DISPOSABLE PHONE?

26:57.703 --> 27:00.227
[normal voice] HEY, IT'S
CHEAPER THAN A PLAN, MAN.

27:01.228 --> 27:03.970
ANYWAY, HE TELLS ME
GO TO HELL.

27:04.013 --> 27:05.667
HE AIN'T COMING OFF
NO MORE CHEDDAR.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.147
AND WE KNOW YOU WENT
TO HIS HOUSE TO FIND HIM.

27:07.190 --> 27:08.539
HE WASN'T THERE.
WHERE'D YOU GO?

27:08.583 --> 27:11.847
[sighs] HIS JOB.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.370
YOU FOUND HIM AT WORK?

27:13.414 --> 27:15.329
NO, HIS CAR WAS PARKED OUT
IN FRONT OF THEM FAKE HOUSES,

27:15.372 --> 27:16.373
SO I TOOK IT.

27:16.417 --> 27:17.766
AND WE FOUND EVIDENCE

27:17.810 --> 27:19.376
THAT HE WAS KILLED
IN ONE OF THOSE MODEL HOMES

27:19.420 --> 27:20.856
AROUND THE SAME TIME
YOU STOLE HIS CAR.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.989
NOW WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T KILL HIM?

27:23.032 --> 27:25.644
BECAUSE THAT WOULDN'T BE
NECESSARY.

27:25.687 --> 27:29.343
SEE, ONCE I GOT THE CAR,
I WAS PAID IN FULL.

27:29.386 --> 27:32.520
[sighs] SO SHADE STOLE
LEM'S CAR,

27:32.563 --> 27:34.565
BUT WHY DOES MY GUT SAY
HE'S NOT THE KILLER?

27:34.609 --> 27:36.306
WELL, YOU HAVE
A VERY SMART GUT.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.352
AND THE ONE THING THAT
SHADE'S STORY DOES CONFIRM

27:38.395 --> 27:40.702
IS THAT LEM WAS OVER AT
THE MODEL HOMES AFTER 8:00 P.M.

27:40.746 --> 27:42.573
LONG AFTER HIS COWORKERS
SAID HE'D LEFT.

27:42.617 --> 27:44.706
TROUBLE IS, ANYONE CAN
GET INTO THOSE MODEL HOMES.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.708
BUT WHAT'S THE MOTIVE?STILL REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.319
I'LL PUT IN A REQUEST
FOR CSI AT CATALINA II.

27:49.363 --> 27:51.670
HEY, BOSS. I FINISHED
GOING THROUGH LEM'S COMPUTER.

27:51.713 --> 27:54.977
HE RECENTLY SET UP NEWS ALERTS
FOR THE CARRINGTON GAZETTE.

27:55.021 --> 27:56.196
CARRINGTON?

27:56.239 --> 27:57.588
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE TOWN

27:57.632 --> 27:59.416
WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR
COMPANY RETREAT.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.070
ACCORDING TO
THE BROWSER HISTORY,

28:01.114 --> 28:03.638
HE RECENTLY READ ALERTS
ABOUT BURGLARIES,

28:03.682 --> 28:05.684
A MISSING HUNTER,
AND A HOUSE FIRE?

28:05.727 --> 28:07.598
HMM. THAT'S INTERESTING.

28:07.642 --> 28:10.471
UH, WHY SET UP A FILTER
FOR A PODUNK NEWSPAPER?

28:11.907 --> 28:15.215
I NEED LEM'S CAR.
HOLD OFF ON THAT CSI TEAM.

28:15.258 --> 28:17.565
LET'S KEEP THE MURDER SITE
UNDER WRAPS FOR NOW.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.741
WHAT? WHY?

28:48.814 --> 28:50.772
THIS IS HIS CAR, RIGHT?

28:50.816 --> 28:52.774
[Tiffany] DEFINITELY.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.210
[Phipps] HOW'D IT GET HERE?

28:54.254 --> 28:56.909
SHOULD I CALL THE POLICE?YES.

28:56.952 --> 28:59.738
AND YOU BETTER CALL DILMER.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.570
[elevator bell dings]

29:10.139 --> 29:11.575
HEY, SARAH.

29:11.619 --> 29:12.707
HEY.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.056
HOW'S LIFE AS AN A.D.A.?

29:14.100 --> 29:16.015
AH, I'M ENJOYING IT.

29:16.058 --> 29:17.625
LOOK, I TRIED TO REACH YOU
BEFORE YOU CAME DOWN.

29:17.668 --> 29:20.106
WE'D LIKE TO HOLD OFF
ON CHARGING JULIANA McVIE.

29:20.149 --> 29:22.282
JUST A BEAT.WHY? IT SOUNDS LIKE A DUNK.

29:22.325 --> 29:24.284
AH, THIS CASE
IS STILL DEVELOPING,

29:24.327 --> 29:26.286
AND, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE HOPING TO USE HER

29:26.329 --> 29:27.417
AGAINST SOME BIGGER FISH.

29:27.461 --> 29:28.767
I'D LIKE TO HAVE
THE LEVERAGE.

29:28.810 --> 29:30.986
OKAY. BUT I'VE READ
THE FILE.

29:31.030 --> 29:32.814
DON'T GIVE HER A PASS
BECAUSE SHE'S SYMPATHETIC.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.947
SHE BROKE THE LAW.
YOU HAVE STATUTORY DUTIES.

29:34.990 --> 29:37.732
I HEAR YOU. HOW'S BEN?

29:37.776 --> 29:39.734
OH. [giggles]
HE'S SO WONDERFUL.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.823
HEY, KEEP ME APPRISED
ON McVIE.

29:41.867 --> 29:44.130
[elevator bell dings,
door opens]

29:44.173 --> 29:47.568
[Dilmer] IT WAS PARKED HERE
WHEN WE OPENED THE OFFICE.

29:47.611 --> 29:49.570
NOTE WAS ALREADY
ON THE WINDSHIELD.

29:49.613 --> 29:53.574
"BRING $50,000 TO THE PLACE
WHERE YOU KILLED LEMUEL McVIE

29:53.617 --> 29:56.272
AT 10:30 TONIGHT OR I GO
TO THE POLICE AT 11:00."

29:56.316 --> 29:57.839
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

29:57.883 --> 30:00.276
THIS CAR WAS STOLEN
BY THE KILLER, WASN'T IT?

30:00.320 --> 30:01.756
THAT'S OUR SUPPOSITION.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.410
SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

30:03.453 --> 30:04.933
I DON'T KNOW, MR. DILMER.

30:04.977 --> 30:06.500
SOMEONE'S PLAYING GAMES,
I GUESS.

30:06.543 --> 30:08.502
OR SOMEONE HERE KNOWS MORE
THAN THEY'RE TELLING.

30:08.545 --> 30:10.199
YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

30:10.243 --> 30:12.114
I MEAN, HAVE YOU EVEN FIGURED
OUT WHERE LEM WAS MURDERED YET?

30:12.158 --> 30:14.464
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

30:14.508 --> 30:16.336
YOU CAN HEAD ON BACK
TO WORK NOW.

30:16.379 --> 30:19.513
LIKE I THOUGHT.
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

30:27.390 --> 30:30.089
OKAY.
THE HOOK HAS BEEN BAITED.

30:34.093 --> 30:36.008
SO NOW WE'RE BREAKING
AND ENTERING?

30:36.051 --> 30:38.010
UH, NO, 'CAUSE, UH...

30:38.053 --> 30:40.839
[whispers] I HAVE THE KEY.
COME ON.

30:45.931 --> 30:48.194
IT WAS LOCKED
THIS MORNING.

30:48.237 --> 30:50.196
[Lisbon whispers indistinctly]

30:52.633 --> 30:54.417
[lock clicks]

30:56.419 --> 30:59.335
NO, IT'S JUST THEFT
AND ILLEGAL ENTRY.

30:59.379 --> 31:01.468
[normal voice]
LADIES FIRST.

31:04.601 --> 31:06.255
[normal voice] WHAT MAKES
YOU SO CERTAIN

31:06.299 --> 31:08.736
THAT THE KILLER WORKS
AT WINTERGROVE REALTY?

31:08.779 --> 31:10.738
IMAGINE, LISBON--

31:10.781 --> 31:13.654
FOR A MERE 20% DOWN,
ALL THIS COULD BE YOURS.

31:13.697 --> 31:15.612
FULLY FURNISHED,

31:15.656 --> 31:17.005
LAVISHLY EQUIPPED.

31:17.049 --> 31:20.139
LACKING ONLY ONE THING.

31:20.182 --> 31:22.271
WHAT?

31:23.620 --> 31:25.840
WELL, ISN'T IT OBVIOUS
THAT THERE SHOULD BE

31:25.884 --> 31:28.582
A LOVELY, DECORATIVE RUG
RIGHT HERE,

31:28.625 --> 31:30.497
PULLING THE WHOLE ROOM
TOGETHER?

31:30.540 --> 31:33.021
THE OTHER MODEL HAD A RUG
RIGHT HERE.

31:33.065 --> 31:35.110
SO THAT'S WHAT THE KILLER
USED TO SOAK UP THE BLOOD

31:35.154 --> 31:36.416
AND GET THE BODY
OUT OF HERE?

31:36.459 --> 31:37.983
PRECISELY.

31:38.026 --> 31:40.072
WE SHOULD WAIT IN HERE.

31:40.115 --> 31:42.857
OH, HERE.
DO YOU WANT A DRINK?

31:42.901 --> 31:44.903
[laughing]THAT STILL DOESN'T PROVE

31:44.946 --> 31:46.948
THAT THE KILLER IS
A WINTERGROVE EMPLOYEE.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.907
WELL, IF IT WASN'T,

31:48.950 --> 31:50.778
WHY WOULDN'T THEY
JUST LEAVE THE BODY HERE?

31:50.821 --> 31:52.606
UH, WHAT'S THE MOTIVE?

31:52.649 --> 31:54.434
SOMETHING HAPPENED
AT THE COMPANY RETREAT,

31:54.477 --> 31:55.957
SOMETHING THAT...WHAT?

31:56.001 --> 31:59.047
WELL, WE WILL ASK WHOEVER
COMES THROUGH THAT FRONT DOOR.

31:59.091 --> 32:00.570
DOWN.REALLY?

32:00.614 --> 32:02.398
COME ON.

32:02.442 --> 32:04.879
[exhales]

32:04.923 --> 32:08.143
[lowered voice] HI.[lowered voice] HI.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.812
WHAT?

32:24.855 --> 32:27.554
[whispering] IT'S OKAY.
YOU WERE TALKING IN YOUR SLEEP.

32:27.597 --> 32:28.859
I WAS?

32:28.903 --> 32:30.687
AND DROOLING A LITTLE.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.515
W-WELL, WHAT DID I SAY?

32:32.559 --> 32:34.343
[vehicle door opens]WELL--SOMEONE'S COMING.

32:34.387 --> 32:35.954
[vehicle door closes]

32:42.003 --> 32:48.618
[lock clicking]

32:53.406 --> 32:55.060
[door opens]

33:00.326 --> 33:02.328
[clicks switch]

33:04.025 --> 33:05.853
[whispering] BOSH.[whispering] WHAT?

33:05.896 --> 33:08.377
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.WHY?

33:08.421 --> 33:10.466
LAZY.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.211
[door closes]

33:18.909 --> 33:22.000
[inhales and exhales]

33:23.958 --> 33:26.178
PHIPPS?

33:26.221 --> 33:27.875
HE AND BOSH HATE EACH OTHER.

33:29.050 --> 33:31.357
[door opens]

33:42.237 --> 33:44.892
[sets bag down and sighs]

33:46.111 --> 33:49.070
DILMER? [gasps]

33:49.114 --> 33:51.377
THE CONSENSUS BUILDER.

33:51.420 --> 33:53.727
I DON'T LIKE THIS. I GOT
A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS.

33:53.770 --> 33:55.555
STOP YOUR WHIMPERING.
YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA?SCREW YOU!

33:55.598 --> 33:56.991
HEY, KNOCK IT OFF.SCREW YOU, I--

33:57.035 --> 33:58.906
KNOCK IT OFF!
BOTH OF YOU.

33:58.949 --> 34:02.257
WE GOTTA STICK TOGETHER HERE.
NO MORE SQUABBLING.[sighs]

34:02.301 --> 34:03.911
EVENING, GENTLEMEN.[switch clicks]

34:05.391 --> 34:07.045
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

34:07.088 --> 34:08.785
CATCHING KILLERS.

34:10.178 --> 34:11.527
BUT THE LETTER...

34:11.571 --> 34:13.616
HE WROTE THE LETTER,
YOU IDIOT!

34:13.660 --> 34:15.966
AH, YOU'RE A QUICK STUDY
THERE, PHIPPS.

34:16.010 --> 34:18.839
QUICK ENOUGH TO KNOW
THERE ISN'T A LAW IN THE LAND

34:18.882 --> 34:20.362
THAT'S GONNA CONVICT US
OF MURDER

34:20.406 --> 34:23.931
BASED OFF OF OUR COMPLIANCE
WITH A VAGUE LETTER.

34:23.974 --> 34:25.759
THAT IS NOT ENTIRELY TRUE.

34:25.802 --> 34:28.414
WE HAVE MOTIVE.HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

34:28.457 --> 34:30.807
YOU KNOW LEM STARTED READING
THE CARRINGTON GAZETTE

34:30.851 --> 34:32.505
WHEN HE CAME BACK
FROM THE RETREAT?

34:32.548 --> 34:35.160
HE WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED
IN A STORY

34:35.203 --> 34:37.118
ABOUT A MISSING HUNTER.

34:37.162 --> 34:39.947
BUT THE HUNTER WASN'T
JUST MISSING, WAS HE?

34:39.990 --> 34:41.905
HE WAS DEAD.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.603
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT A HUNTER.

34:43.646 --> 34:44.952
OKAY.

34:44.995 --> 34:46.823
YEAH. THANKS, BOSH.

34:47.955 --> 34:49.739
YOU CAN GO.
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.699
WHAT?

34:52.742 --> 34:55.528
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.
WE CAN HANDLE THIS.

34:55.571 --> 34:58.270
WAIT. WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU CUT A DEAL?

34:58.313 --> 34:59.619
NO, NO, NO, OF COURSE--
I DON'T KNOW--

34:59.662 --> 35:00.924
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

35:00.968 --> 35:02.578
THEN TELL ME
WHY YOU GET TO GO!

35:02.622 --> 35:04.276
YOU REALLY THINK BOSH
IS THE KIND OF GUY

35:04.319 --> 35:05.755
THAT'S GONNA SIT AROUND
AND TAKE THE RAP

35:05.799 --> 35:07.235
WHEN YOU TWO DOPES
ARE AVAILABLE?

35:08.845 --> 35:10.717
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T
SELL US OUT.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.371
NO, NO, HE'S MESSING WITH YOU!THEN WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

35:12.414 --> 35:14.764
HE'S MESSING WITH YOU,
JACKASS!

35:14.808 --> 35:17.419
CORRECT.

35:17.463 --> 35:20.683
[chuckles] I WAS JUST
MESSING WITH YOU.

35:20.727 --> 35:22.946
LISBON, ARREST THESE CLOWNS.

35:22.990 --> 35:25.297
PUT YOUR HANDS
ON YOUR HEADS NOW!

35:48.276 --> 35:50.060
[sighs, clicks pen]

35:52.106 --> 35:53.934
THE WHEELBASE AND TIRE PATTERN
OF YOUR S.U.V.

35:53.977 --> 35:55.544
MATCH THE TRACKS
AT THE GOLF COURSE.

35:55.588 --> 35:58.547
[clicks tongue]
CONGRATULATIONS.

35:58.591 --> 35:59.679
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

36:01.246 --> 36:04.031
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

36:04.074 --> 36:07.208
WE WERE UP IN CARRINGTON
FOR THE RETREAT.

36:07.252 --> 36:11.691
DILMER, PHIPPSY, LEM, AND I
WERE OUT IN THE--THE WOODS.

36:11.734 --> 36:14.694
YOU KNOW, DRINKING A LITTLE,
SHOOTING A LITTLE,

36:14.737 --> 36:16.086
BLOWING OFF STEAM.

36:16.130 --> 36:17.697
DID LEM GO SHOOTING
WITH YOU?

36:17.740 --> 36:21.135
NO. SAID HE USED
ENOUGH GUNS.

36:21.179 --> 36:24.007
HE DRANK UP MORE THAN
HIS SHARE OF BEERS, THOUGH.

36:24.051 --> 36:27.228
[laughs]

36:27.272 --> 36:30.013
[sniffles]

36:30.057 --> 36:31.711
UM...

36:31.754 --> 36:33.060
THEN BOSH...

36:33.103 --> 36:36.455
SEES THIS TREE BRANCH MOVE
ABOUT 50 YARDS AWAY.

36:36.498 --> 36:38.500
THINKS IT'S A DEER.

36:38.544 --> 36:41.111
AND HE STARTS SHOOTING.

36:41.155 --> 36:42.852
[speaking indistinctly]HEY, SHH, SHH!

36:42.896 --> 36:44.071
I KNOW!

36:44.114 --> 36:45.115
[rustling]

36:45.159 --> 36:46.247
GET DOWN!

36:46.291 --> 36:48.249
[Dilmer] AND WE ALL
START SHOOTING.

36:49.859 --> 36:51.513
[guns cocking and shooting]

36:58.651 --> 37:00.827
WHOO![laughing]

37:00.870 --> 37:02.263
YEAH, BABY!WHOO!

37:02.307 --> 37:04.222
ALL RIGHT!IT'S MINE! [laughing]

37:04.265 --> 37:05.527
I GOT ME A DEER!

37:05.571 --> 37:07.355
I HIT IT!WHOO-HOO!

37:07.399 --> 37:09.618
[Bosh] WE GO TO SEE
WHAT WE GOT.

37:11.620 --> 37:13.579
IT WAS A MAN.

37:13.622 --> 37:16.364
EVERYONE STARTED
FREAKING OUT, YOU KNOW?

37:17.931 --> 37:20.412
LEM WANTED TO GO
TO THE POLICE.

37:20.455 --> 37:22.631
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
HE REASONED.

37:22.675 --> 37:25.852
BUT I KNOW THAT WASN'T
A REAL OPTION.

37:25.895 --> 37:27.941
I'M A LAWYER.
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.

37:27.984 --> 37:30.596
WE'D BE IN FOR YEARS
OF LEGAL HELL,

37:30.639 --> 37:31.901
MILLIONS IN LAWYERS' FEES.

37:31.945 --> 37:34.034
SO LEM AGREED TO HIDE
THE BODY.

37:34.077 --> 37:36.471
WE ALL AGREED.AS A TEAM.

37:36.515 --> 37:37.907
AS A FAMILY.

37:38.995 --> 37:41.737
IT WAS THE BEST THING
FOR ALL OF US.

37:41.781 --> 37:44.044
BUT WHEN WE GOT BACK,
LEM PULLS ME ASIDE.

37:44.087 --> 37:45.611
HE SAYS HE CAN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT,

37:45.654 --> 37:47.482
AND HE TRIES TO CONVINCE ME
THAT WE CAN SALVAGE THIS THING

37:47.526 --> 37:49.615
IF WE ALL JUST COME CLEAN.

37:49.658 --> 37:52.922
HE WAS GONNA CONFESS
TO THE COPS.

37:55.185 --> 37:57.144
SO I AGREED WITH HIM.

37:57.187 --> 37:59.146
TOLD HIM I NEEDED A LITTLE
BIT OF TIME

37:59.189 --> 38:00.800
TO GET SOME THINGS
IN ORDER.

38:00.843 --> 38:03.977
BUT INSTEAD, YOU PLANNED HOW
YOU WERE GONNA GET RID OF LEM.

38:04.020 --> 38:06.893
YES. THAT NIGHT.

38:09.025 --> 38:11.419
[Dilmer] I ASKED HIM TO OPEN
CATALINA II

38:11.463 --> 38:14.292
TO MEET WITH SOME
LATE ARRIVING CLIENTS.

38:15.858 --> 38:18.687
IT WAS SCUD DUTY
FOR THE JUNIOR SALESMEN,

38:18.731 --> 38:21.211
SO HE DIDN'T THINK
ANYTHING OF IT.

38:22.212 --> 38:24.650
[Bosh] WE DID IT TOGETHER.

38:24.693 --> 38:26.782
[loud thud]

38:26.826 --> 38:28.654
SO THAT WE'D ALL
BE EQUALLY GUILTY.

38:28.697 --> 38:30.438
[blows landing]

38:30.482 --> 38:32.962
WE WERE GONNA DUMP HIM
AND THE CAR,

38:33.006 --> 38:35.400
BUT WHEN WE GOT BACK
OUT OF THE HOUSE,

38:35.443 --> 38:38.054
THE CAR W--
IT WAS GONE.

38:38.098 --> 38:41.014
THAT'S WHAT SCREWED US.

38:41.057 --> 38:43.669
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENED.

38:45.714 --> 38:48.064
WHO TOOK THE CAR?

38:48.108 --> 38:50.850
[hip-hop music playing]

38:50.893 --> 38:52.765
[Shade] HIS CAR WAS PARKED OUT IN FRONT OF THEM FAKE HOUSES,

38:52.808 --> 38:54.680
SO I TOOK IT.

38:54.723 --> 38:57.204
WHERE'D YOU GUYS GET IT?

39:00.425 --> 39:02.035
YOU CAN READ ABOUT IT
IN THE PAPER.

39:04.907 --> 39:06.866
[door opens]

39:11.914 --> 39:13.873
[sighs]

39:16.919 --> 39:20.401
NICE DIGS DOWN HERE
IN MAJOR CRIMES.

39:20.445 --> 39:22.098
AGENT WADE.

39:22.142 --> 39:23.622

WAYNE RIGSBY.

39:23.665 --> 39:25.101

TAMSIN WADE.

39:25.145 --> 39:27.103
SHE'S HEADING THE NEW
RAPID RESPONSE TEAM FOR CBI.

39:27.147 --> 39:29.410
OH, NICE.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

39:29.454 --> 39:32.500
LIKEWISE. THAT'S ACTUALLY WHY
I CAME TO SEE YOU, CHO.

39:32.544 --> 39:33.893
WHAT'S UP?

39:33.936 --> 39:35.590
I HAVEN'T SELECTED AN AGENT
FROM MAJOR CRIMES

39:35.634 --> 39:36.939
FOR THE TEAM.

39:36.983 --> 39:38.376
IT WOULDN'T INTERFERE
WITH YOUR DAILY DUTIES,

39:38.419 --> 39:40.421
AND I CLEARED IT
WITH AGENT LISBON.

39:40.465 --> 39:43.206
SO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,
WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD.

39:43.250 --> 39:44.425
SURE.

39:44.469 --> 39:46.122
GREAT.

39:46.166 --> 39:48.560
OH, AND, UH,
END OF SHIFT,

39:48.603 --> 39:50.475
A FEW OF US ARE HITTING
THE RANGE

39:50.518 --> 39:53.260
IF YOU WANT TO COME JOIN US,
SAY HI TO THE TEAM.

39:53.303 --> 39:54.653
I'LL SEE YOU OUT THERE.

39:54.696 --> 39:56.959
AGENT RIGSBY.YEAH.

40:02.182 --> 40:04.793
LEM'S KILLER HAS LED
THE POLICE UP IN CARRINGTON

40:04.837 --> 40:06.708
TO THE BODY OF THE HUNTER
THEY KILLED.

40:06.752 --> 40:08.493
POOR GUY.

40:08.536 --> 40:09.755
TERESA, HEY.

40:09.798 --> 40:12.279
HEY, SARAH. THANKS
FOR COMING BY.

40:13.585 --> 40:15.238
I WANTED YOU TO MEET
MISS McVIE

40:15.282 --> 40:18.459
BEFORE WE MADE A DECISION
ABOUT THE CHARGES AGAINST HER.

40:18.503 --> 40:21.375
THIS IS JULIANA
AND HER BROTHER NOAH.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.811
HI.

40:22.855 --> 40:24.073
HEY.

40:24.117 --> 40:26.293
SARAH WORKS
AT THE D.A.'s OFFICE.

40:27.294 --> 40:29.470
SHE JUST HAD A BABY BOY
LAST YEAR.

40:29.514 --> 40:32.560
YES, I DID.
LISBON, DO YOU WANT TO--

40:32.604 --> 40:35.302
AND I WAS GONNA TELL THEM
THAT THEIR BROTHER DIED

40:35.345 --> 40:37.696
BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO
DO THE RIGHT THING.

40:37.739 --> 40:39.785
HE'S KIND OF A HERO.

40:39.828 --> 40:43.745
WELL, YEAH, I GUESS
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

40:43.789 --> 40:47.662
AND I WAS GONNA SAY THAT GIVEN
THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES,

40:47.706 --> 40:50.056
THAT MAYBE THE CBI
AND THE D.A.'s OFFICE

40:50.099 --> 40:53.929
WOULD CONSIDER DROPPING
THE CHARGES AGAINST JULIANA.

40:53.973 --> 40:56.149
BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT
THING TO DO.

41:02.895 --> 41:04.113
YES.

41:04.157 --> 41:05.767
OKAY. [clears throat]

41:05.811 --> 41:09.554
NICELY PLAYED, TERESA.
YOU OWE ME ONE.

41:09.597 --> 41:13.383
