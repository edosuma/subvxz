00:18.051 --> 00:19.151
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>The Last Man on Earth...</i>

00:19.153 --> 00:20.519
You were gonna go
skinny dipping?

00:20.521 --> 00:21.453
It was a prank.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.122
You just sprayed
the wrong dog.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.456
We should have never
gotten married,

00:24.458 --> 00:25.691
and I'm really,
really sorry.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.792
PHIL:
Divorce papers?

00:26.794 --> 00:28.961
You're better off
without me.

00:28.963 --> 00:32.231
CAROL: So the reason Phil and I
called you here tonight is

00:32.233 --> 00:34.533
to let you know
that we have made

00:34.535 --> 00:36.635
the mutual decision
to get divorced.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.037
The big D.

00:38.039 --> 00:41.040
You know, we truly do want
what's best for each other.

00:41.042 --> 00:43.375
Which means we'll be avoiding
each other like the plague.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.077
(forced laugh)
(laughing):
I'm just kidding.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.079
Carol knows that my
door is always open.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.714
Oh, not as open
as my door

00:48.716 --> 00:50.516
that you promised
to fix but never did.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.651
(forced laughter)

00:52.653 --> 00:53.652
We'll never lose this.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.020
This is, uh, here to stay.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.855
Hey, to Carol.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.490
Oh.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.492
I sincerely hope you find
the happiness

01:00.494 --> 01:01.927
that I was never
able to give you.

01:01.929 --> 01:02.928
And...
And I mean that.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.263
And to Phil.

01:04.265 --> 01:07.699
Thank you for three
wonderful weeks of marriage.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.101
Three weeks...?!

01:09.103 --> 01:11.403
Specifically the first day
and a half was really something.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.872
Hear, hear.
Hm.

01:13.874 --> 01:16.542
(laughing):
Ah, enough chit-chat.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.010
Who wants to dance?

01:18.012 --> 01:19.411
Hit it, Gail.

01:22.515 --> 01:25.250
(playing a dirge)

01:30.523 --> 01:33.092
(playing a waltz)

01:51.277 --> 01:53.779
Carol, I'm throwing paint
into a wood chipper

01:53.781 --> 01:55.781
right now, for no reason!

01:55.783 --> 01:57.950
Just mindless, messy fun.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.387
'Cause I don't have to answer
to anybody anymore!

02:02.389 --> 02:04.389
Anybody!

02:04.391 --> 02:05.891
(laughs)

02:05.893 --> 02:07.292
(knocking on door)
Oh, shoot.

02:15.568 --> 02:16.902
Ugh, whatever.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.237
Come in.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.172
Gail.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.407
Hey, Phil.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.076
Hey, indeed.
Hey, indeed.

02:24.078 --> 02:25.744
What can I do you for?

02:25.746 --> 02:27.012
I did not realize

02:27.014 --> 02:30.015
that you and Carol were only
married for three weeks.

02:30.017 --> 02:33.452
That puts kind of a different
little spin on things.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.020
Oh, yeah?

02:35.022 --> 02:36.355
Oh, yeah.

02:36.357 --> 02:38.023
I just thought
I'd come by and see

02:38.025 --> 02:39.958
if maybe you wanted
to have a little fun.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.628
(chuckles)
Well, you know.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.962
I love fun, you know?

02:43.964 --> 02:45.264
Big fun enthusiast.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.632
Uh.
Mmm.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.267
What you, uh...

02:48.269 --> 02:52.304
whatcha thinkin'
'bout, uh, fun-wise?

02:52.306 --> 02:53.639
Um...

02:53.641 --> 02:56.608
I'm sure we can think
of something.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.377
(chuckles)
Oh, God, no doubt.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.345
Two adults searching
for fun.

03:00.347 --> 03:03.415
Yeah, prospects are good.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.351
So, uh...

03:06.353 --> 03:08.654
We talking, like...

03:08.656 --> 03:10.155
watch a movie or...?

03:10.157 --> 03:12.057
No, Phil, I don't want
to watch a movie.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.358
Wh-Why? Do you want
to watch a movie?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.360
No, no, I just want to do
whatever you want to do.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.795
You know, whatever's
in that mind of yours.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.164
Well, Phil,
you are in luck,

03:19.166 --> 03:21.133
because a couple of
very detailed plans

03:21.135 --> 03:22.534
just popped into my head.

03:23.836 --> 03:25.470
Why don't you, uh,
debrief me?

03:25.472 --> 03:27.139
(sultry chuckle)

03:27.141 --> 03:28.373
That can be arranged.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.975
CAROL:
Hey, guys.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.311
Just picking up
more of my stuff.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.745
Divorce, right?

03:33.747 --> 03:36.148
Carol, now's not the...
the best time.

03:36.150 --> 03:37.382
Oh, don't mind me.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.551
You guys just go back
to what you were doing.

03:40.853 --> 03:42.087
Why don't I come
back later?

03:42.089 --> 03:43.755
Say around 3:00?

03:43.757 --> 03:45.090
Hmm.

03:45.092 --> 03:48.160
Might be up doing some chores
in my bedroom about that time.

03:48.162 --> 03:49.695
Well, why don't we
just meet up there?

03:49.697 --> 03:50.929
Okay.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.931
See you later, Phil.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.567
(chuckles)

03:56.836 --> 03:58.437
A little breakfast
for my lady.
Aw...

03:58.439 --> 03:59.838
Aw. Thank you, Todd.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.173
You know how I love
butt pancakes.

04:01.175 --> 04:02.407
Oh, woops. Sorry.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.875
(they giggle)

04:03.877 --> 04:04.876
An upside down butt.
Yep.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.445
Even better.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.779
Well, I hope you like it.

04:07.781 --> 04:10.616
And I mean that from the bottom
of my upside down butt.

04:14.354 --> 04:16.021
What?

04:16.023 --> 04:19.024
Nothing, I just...

04:19.026 --> 04:20.459
I'm happier than I've ever been.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.860
It's all because of you.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.228
Todd...

04:23.230 --> 04:25.530
No, I mean it... you know?

04:25.532 --> 04:27.266
When I was
out there, you know,

04:27.268 --> 04:30.936
the world was dark and empty.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.939
Then you came along,
and you filled it with light.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.810
I guess what I'm saying is...

04:38.812 --> 04:40.479
I love you, Melissa.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.547
Todd...

04:45.285 --> 04:47.386
Thank you.

04:55.728 --> 04:57.796
You're welcome.

05:01.334 --> 05:02.734
Ah...
Hey, Phil.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.069
G'day, Erica.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.237
G'day, cow.

05:05.239 --> 05:06.838
(Phil laughs)
Someone's in a good mood.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.173
Oh, is she talking to you, girl?

05:08.175 --> 05:10.309
You in a good moooooood?

05:10.311 --> 05:11.510
A little cow humor.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.578
So single life's
treating you well?

05:13.580 --> 05:14.613
Oh, yeah.

05:14.615 --> 05:15.981
Breaking up was definitely in...

05:15.983 --> 05:17.516
in everybody's best interest,
you know?

05:17.518 --> 05:18.917
And I wish Carol all the best.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.252
And she does the same for me.

05:20.254 --> 05:21.420
She's a good kid.
Hm.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.521
And I'm a good kid.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.855
We're good kids. Mm.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.191
Hey, so I was thinking

05:26.193 --> 05:29.494
about going on a hike later,
at this bluff I found.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.929
Yeah?

05:30.931 --> 05:33.265
Do you have any
interest in that?

05:33.267 --> 05:35.534
I'll call that bluff
any day of the week, you know?

05:35.536 --> 05:37.169
Love to go on a hike with you.

05:37.171 --> 05:38.603
Big hiking enthusiast.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.305
Got all the gear,
got the mindset.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.640
Let's do it, let's do it.

05:41.642 --> 05:42.941
Let's get that hike on.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.209
Shall we say 5:00?

05:44.211 --> 05:45.544
5:00 is perfect.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.379
It's, like, heaven-sent.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.715
I got a little appointment
at 3:00, but knowing my history,

05:49.717 --> 05:52.117
that won't last
anywhere near two hours.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.952
So 5:00 it is, yes, yes, yes.

05:53.954 --> 05:54.886
I'll see you at 5:00.

05:54.888 --> 05:55.887
I'll see <i>you</i> at 5:00.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.456
(both chuckle)

05:59.792 --> 06:02.861
You see what just happened
there, didn't you?

06:06.799 --> 06:08.400
Hey, bud. You okay?

06:08.402 --> 06:10.469
Why are you out here
walking all alone?

06:10.471 --> 06:12.471
(stammer quietly)

06:12.473 --> 06:16.241
I told Melissa I loved her, and
she didn't say anything back.

06:16.243 --> 06:17.576
Oh, that's a major burn.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.578
Oh, that's horrible.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.079
You must feel like crap.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.748
God, that is a bummer.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.416
That's... that's big time.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.485
That's a big time...

06:26.487 --> 06:27.486
That sucks.

06:27.488 --> 06:28.520
Yeah.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.188
Hey, even if
she wasn't into you,

06:30.190 --> 06:31.890
we're the only
two guys around, okay?

06:31.892 --> 06:33.759
And she hates me,
so I think you're safe.

06:33.761 --> 06:34.993
You know, I just
keep thinking,

06:34.995 --> 06:36.495
you know, if we
all showed up,

06:36.497 --> 06:38.263
what's to say other
people won't show up?

06:38.265 --> 06:40.832
Relax, nobody else is
gonna show up.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.167
Well, how can you be so sure?

06:42.169 --> 06:43.668
Because I am.

06:43.670 --> 06:44.936
Look, I'm finally
single again.

06:44.938 --> 06:48.006
I-I'm friends with my ex,
and I have two dates lined up,

06:48.008 --> 06:49.674
one of which is
a straight-up sex date.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.343
I'm about 69 percent
sure of that.

06:51.345 --> 06:53.044
I have even more
to lose than you.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.347
And do I look
nervous about it?

06:55.349 --> 06:56.848
No, you don't.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.383
Good.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.385
'Cause I'm not.

07:00.387 --> 07:01.787
Go ahead.

07:18.070 --> 07:21.039
I got a good thing
going here, Tucson.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.475
I don't need anyone showing up
to blow it for me.

07:32.218 --> 07:33.985
Hmm.

07:33.987 --> 07:37.622
Just a little insurance,
and I am good to...

07:37.624 --> 07:39.958
No...!

07:39.960 --> 07:41.393
(shouts)

07:42.628 --> 07:44.396
Oh, farts.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.000
Help!

07:49.002 --> 07:50.569
(sobbing):
Help!

07:50.571 --> 07:52.237
Oh, God, please help!

07:52.239 --> 07:54.105
Please help me!

07:54.107 --> 07:55.674
(gasping anxiously)

07:57.510 --> 07:59.177
I can make that.
I can make that.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.179
If I land just right,
I can make it.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.581
I just have to land
exactly right.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.115
Just have to land it perfectly.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.417
(laughs aggressively)

08:05.419 --> 08:08.687
Two beautiful women waiting
for you at home, Phil.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.423
Now, stick the landing
and get home

08:11.425 --> 08:13.425
and make love to those women!

08:14.694 --> 08:16.027
One...

08:16.029 --> 08:17.462
Two...

08:17.464 --> 08:20.165
Help me!

08:20.167 --> 08:22.601
Help me, I'm gonna die up here!

08:22.603 --> 08:25.303
(sobbing):
Help!

08:25.305 --> 08:28.273
I am so scared!

08:28.275 --> 08:30.976
(whimpers)

08:30.978 --> 08:32.944
Phil?

08:32.946 --> 08:34.880
It's 3:00.

08:37.149 --> 08:38.917
Phil...?

08:39.952 --> 08:41.353
Phil?

08:48.561 --> 08:50.362
You dirty dog.

09:07.413 --> 09:09.548
Oh, finally, some shade.

09:10.149 --> 09:12.317
No...!

09:12.319 --> 09:14.352
You were my shade!

09:14.354 --> 09:16.421
And my pants!

09:17.356 --> 09:18.757
ERICA:
Phil?

09:21.994 --> 09:23.995
Gail...

09:23.997 --> 09:25.497
Gail.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.668
Erica.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.170
What are you
doing here?
I was supposed
to meet up with Phil.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.505
So was I.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.507
Yeah, I can see that.

09:35.509 --> 09:37.008
Guess we got double-booked.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.110
And double stood up.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.546
Phil.
Friggin' Phil.

09:41.548 --> 09:42.881
Phil, oh...

09:42.883 --> 09:44.215
Wow! (chuckles)

09:44.217 --> 09:45.550
You didn't waste
any time.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.719
Carol, Phil and I were
just gonna go hiking.

09:47.721 --> 09:50.221
I don't need to know
your little Australian terms

09:50.223 --> 09:52.123
for when a man plays
with your breasts.

09:52.125 --> 09:55.193
Gail, I suppose that you were
gonna go "hiking," too?

09:55.195 --> 09:57.128
No, we were
gonna have sex.

09:57.130 --> 10:01.199
Not upset, just know you're
getting my sloppy seconds.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.400
(chuckles)

10:02.402 --> 10:04.135
And they were sloppy.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.208
Good morning.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.210
Here you go.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.212
Breakfast is served.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.580
What's this?

10:15.582 --> 10:16.748
Uh, did I miss something?

10:16.750 --> 10:17.816
It's juice, syrup, pancake.

10:17.818 --> 10:18.883
All there.

10:18.885 --> 10:20.051
Todd, what's wrong?

10:20.053 --> 10:22.287
(sighs) Nothing's wrong,
everything's great.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.389
Look, I'm sorry
about the other day.

10:24.391 --> 10:27.459
It's just I don't take saying
the L-word lightly.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.730
Please don't read more
into it than that.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.764
I won't. (scoffs)

10:32.766 --> 10:33.832
I'm already not.

10:33.834 --> 10:34.866
Look.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.305
All fixed.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.475
Want some?

10:46.178 --> 10:47.579
No.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.395
(whines)

11:08.367 --> 11:10.502
So... (chuckles)

11:10.504 --> 11:12.437
How was your little

11:12.439 --> 11:15.507
ménage à three-way
with my very recent ex-husband?

11:15.509 --> 11:17.008
He never showed up.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.543
What?

11:18.545 --> 11:20.445
Phil Miller
missed out on a chance

11:20.447 --> 11:21.880
to have sex with two women?

11:23.282 --> 11:25.150
Oh, my God.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.886
Phil's dead.

11:44.637 --> 11:48.073
So, as you know, Phil's been
missing for about 24 hours,

11:48.075 --> 11:50.008
and I think we need
to look for him.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.543
I'm sure he's fine.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.011
Maybe we should organize
a search party.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.045
Where do we start?

11:54.047 --> 11:55.513
Well, who saw him last?

11:55.515 --> 11:56.748
(truck approaching)

11:56.750 --> 11:58.049
Oh, there he is.

11:59.585 --> 12:01.319
No, that's not Phil's truck.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.354
Well, then whose truck is it?

12:03.356 --> 12:07.058
Oh, my God.

12:12.598 --> 12:14.733
This guy belong to you?

12:18.170 --> 12:19.838
So I was driving
down Route 77...

12:19.840 --> 12:22.040
I saw a ladder laying
beside a billboard.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.742
So I looked up at the sign,
I saw something move.

12:23.744 --> 12:24.843
Now, you know, it's not often

12:24.845 --> 12:26.778
you catch something moving
these days.

12:26.780 --> 12:29.047
So I stopped to check it out,
and I found this guy

12:29.049 --> 12:30.615
passed out
in his underwear.

12:30.617 --> 12:33.918
I was surprised he didn't notice
the ladder behind the billboard.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.520
There was a ladder?

12:35.522 --> 12:38.356
Thank you so much
for bringing him back to us.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.525
(scoffs) Sorry, we don't even
know your name.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.926
I'm Phil; Phil Miller.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.228
I'm...
What?

12:43.230 --> 12:46.264
Wait, your name is Phil Miller?
Excuse me?

12:46.266 --> 12:47.599
I'm Phil Miller.
Hold it.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.634
He's in shock-- he's just
repeating what I'm saying.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.736
No, his name
really is Phil Miller.

12:51.738 --> 12:52.971
Seven people left on Earth,

12:52.973 --> 12:54.706
and two of them are
named Phil Miller?

12:54.708 --> 12:56.374
GAIL: And they could not be
more different.
I'm Phil.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.644
I mean, apples and and oranges.

12:59.646 --> 13:00.979
Your name really is Phil Miller?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.447
Are you...
Okay, folks.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.315
Situation is we got
two Phil Millers.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.884
(weakly): I'm Phil Miller.
CAROL: Okay, okay.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.052
Well, tell us
about yourself.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.088
I mean, who is Phil Miller?

13:10.090 --> 13:11.256
Well, I'm from North Carolina.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.924
Get out of town. Me, too.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.325
What part?
I was stationed at Fort Bragg.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.727
Former military.

13:15.729 --> 13:17.162
My dad was in the military.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.564
I did military.
Phil... (grunts)

13:19.566 --> 13:21.166
No, but I was military.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.901
I'm not making that up...
Go on, new Phil.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.269
Well, after I left
the Special Forces,

13:24.271 --> 13:25.403
I became a contractor,

13:25.405 --> 13:26.771
mostly for Habitat
for Humanity,

13:26.773 --> 13:29.340
but also to make
a buck here and there.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.476
That's awesome. I-I also did
Habitat for Humanity in college.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.944
Yeah, that's right.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.780
Yeah, hey, Phil, I'm Todd,
Melissa's boyfriend.

13:35.782 --> 13:36.915
CAROL: It's so nice

13:36.917 --> 13:38.750
to have someone here
with practical skills.

13:38.752 --> 13:41.119
I mean, none of us have any idea
what we're doing.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.620
I wouldn't say none of us.

13:42.622 --> 13:43.955
So, when are you guys
going to Tampa?

13:43.957 --> 13:45.523
What do you mean?
Uh...

13:45.525 --> 13:47.258
When I found Phil,
he had written

13:47.260 --> 13:49.194
"Moved to Tampa"
on the billboard.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.629
Ah, yeah, let's just keep
talking about something else.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.097
Why would you do that, Phil?

13:53.099 --> 13:54.766
Prank.
MELISSA: We all know why.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.868
He was finally gonna get
a chance to sow his oats,

13:56.870 --> 13:59.270
and he didn't want anyone else
to come in and ruin it for him.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.138
(all groaning, sighing)
Disgusting.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.539
(groans)

14:01.541 --> 14:03.942
Well, Phil Miller,
why don't you let us

14:03.944 --> 14:06.044
give you a little tour
of the neighborhood?

14:06.046 --> 14:07.111
PHIL 2: It's late.
We do it now. Let's go.
TODD: Yeah, come on.

14:07.113 --> 14:09.147
Please, here. There you go.
CAROL: Oh, thank you.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.148
TODD: Why not?

14:10.150 --> 14:11.950
CAROL: Gentleman.
TODD: Do you walk, Phil?

14:11.952 --> 14:13.685
PHIL 2: All right, Phil.

14:16.555 --> 14:18.156
I'm Phil Miller.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.325
Well, that guy's handsome.

14:20.327 --> 14:23.127
So we now have a super
handsome guy on the block.

14:23.129 --> 14:24.395
That's fun, huh?

14:24.397 --> 14:26.130
Just fell from the sky

14:26.132 --> 14:29.500
like a gosh dang angel.

14:29.502 --> 14:30.735
Todd?
Yeah?

14:30.737 --> 14:31.970
We doing okay?

14:31.972 --> 14:33.037
Yeah, no, fine.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.640
I'm just pumped up, you know?

14:35.642 --> 14:38.509
I mean, it's not every day
you meet a guy like that.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.245
You know, I mean,
he's an absolute ten

14:40.247 --> 14:42.247
in the looks department.

14:42.249 --> 14:45.516
You guys have that whole
Habitat thing going on.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.085
You know? How fun is that?

14:47.087 --> 14:48.086
Right?

14:48.088 --> 14:49.754
Excuse me.

14:52.658 --> 14:53.892
Oh, my goodness.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.226
Can you imagine

14:55.228 --> 14:58.029
how gorgeous your little babies
would be?

14:58.031 --> 15:00.732
Todd, we've talked about this.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.100
I like <i>you.</i>

15:02.102 --> 15:03.434
Yeah, but you don't love me.

15:04.370 --> 15:05.536
(sighs)

15:05.538 --> 15:06.771
I... I'm, I'm sorry.

15:06.773 --> 15:07.839
I just...

15:07.841 --> 15:09.674
Being with you has been
like a dream,

15:09.676 --> 15:12.677
and I am just so scared
I am gonna screw it up.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.012
Then don't screw it up.

15:14.014 --> 15:17.448
Just be your normal, sweet,
charming self,

15:17.450 --> 15:18.683
and everything will be fine.

15:18.685 --> 15:19.918
Hah! "Will be" fine, right?

15:19.920 --> 15:21.052
So you admit everything's not
currently fine?

15:21.054 --> 15:22.353
Todd!

15:22.355 --> 15:23.888
I-I got it, I got it.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.189
Yeah, I got it.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.525
Totally got it.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.893
Hey, hey, hey.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.762
I just wanted to apologize

15:30.764 --> 15:32.297
for, uh,
missing our date yesterday.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.198
Circumstances
were just cray-cray.

15:34.200 --> 15:34.966
Uh, yeah.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.100
Speaking of cray-cray...

15:36.102 --> 15:37.468
Sorry about this, you know?

15:37.470 --> 15:39.537
Looks painful.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.272
It is, it is,
it hurts quite a bit,

15:41.274 --> 15:42.874
but, you know,
that's not the painful part.

15:42.876 --> 15:43.908
That's the healing part.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.043
The part below is painful.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.477
(sighs)

15:46.479 --> 15:47.812
You know, speaking of painful,

15:47.814 --> 15:50.949
uh, we were talking
about having some...

15:50.951 --> 15:52.216
sex earlier,

15:52.218 --> 15:54.953
and, uh, I just wanted
to know what you're, uh,

15:54.955 --> 15:56.621
what you're up to right now.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.990
Um, no, Phil,
I'm actually gonna hit the hay.

15:58.992 --> 16:01.459
Why would you hit the hay?
Are you mad at it? Boom.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.127
(forced chuckle)
Yeah.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.129
Okay, good night.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.631
Is, uh, Erica around?

16:06.633 --> 16:09.334
Actually, she's, um,
she's gonna turn in, too.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.402
Turn into what? I didn't know
she was a shape shifter.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.503
Boom.

16:12.505 --> 16:13.638
Ha-ha.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.306
Okay, well, good night, now.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.908
Oh, oh, good night.

16:17.843 --> 16:19.677
PHIL 2:
At the White House?

16:19.679 --> 16:21.312
(laughter)

16:21.314 --> 16:23.081
What a place to be found.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.315
Yeah...
(cork pops, laughter)

16:24.317 --> 16:25.483
PHIL 2:
All right!

16:28.754 --> 16:29.854
Okay, do we have everyone?

16:29.856 --> 16:31.456
Raise your hand
if you're not here.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.424
(chuckles)
All right, ice broken.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.493
Uh, so the reason I called
you all here today is,

16:35.495 --> 16:37.261
because, as your president...
GAIL: Wait.

16:37.263 --> 16:38.496
Wait, what?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.698
Phil's the, uh,

16:40.700 --> 16:42.333
president of the
United States, so...

16:42.335 --> 16:44.035
It's a long story.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.371
But it's legit, you know?
Anyway, as you're president,

16:46.373 --> 16:48.339
I just wanted you all to know
that you can always come to me

16:48.341 --> 16:50.208
if you need anything, okay?

16:50.210 --> 16:53.544
And that-that privilege
now extends to you, new guy.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.380
Oh, his name's
Phil Miller, Phil.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.448
It should be easy
to remember.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.350
The point is, new guy, uh,

16:59.352 --> 17:01.953
you know, if you ever
need anything, come to me.

17:01.955 --> 17:03.488
PHIL 2: Well, Mr. President,
what are y'all doing

17:03.490 --> 17:04.555
about electricity?

17:04.557 --> 17:05.723
Uh, generators, obviously.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.792
(scoffs)
Next question.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.827
You're in a perfect spot
for wind and solar.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.662
We-we had no idea.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.965
Oh, well, I can take a look
at all that stuff.

17:13.967 --> 17:16.634
Geez, get a room, you two.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.202
(Todd laughs)

17:19.138 --> 17:20.872
Am I right?

17:20.874 --> 17:22.974
I mean, come on.

17:25.677 --> 17:27.311
Okay, I got to go.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.581
TODD (muttering):
...jeans tight enough?

17:32.484 --> 17:34.752
Sorry.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.988
Well, well, good news
is you're on a smart grid,

17:36.990 --> 17:40.191
which will help get
the electricity up and running.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.692
Phil, you are a godsend.

17:41.694 --> 17:42.860
Thank you.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.662
Oh, I was talking
to the other Phil.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.831
That makes sense, since he was
the one who just spoke.

17:46.833 --> 17:47.598
CAROL: You know,
that's another thing.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.067
This having two Phil Millers

17:49.069 --> 17:51.002
is getting confusing already.

17:51.004 --> 17:52.670
Yeah.
GAIL:
Yes, I agree.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.173
Maybe you should both go
by your middle names.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.774
No, no, no, no, no.
I was here first.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.943
I'm the president;
I should get to be Phil.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.945
Phil, what's your middle name?

18:00.947 --> 18:02.713
Tandy.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.182
T-Tandy?

18:04.184 --> 18:05.616
Yeah.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.920
(laughing): What kind
of middle name is Tandy?

18:08.922 --> 18:09.954
It's my mother's maiden name.

18:09.956 --> 18:12.857
Was your mother Jessica Tandy?

18:14.026 --> 18:15.793
Yes.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.895
Oh, that's neat.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.397
His mother is not Jessica Tandy.

18:19.399 --> 18:20.631
Oh, you know my lineage?

18:20.633 --> 18:23.534
Phil, what's your middle name?

18:23.536 --> 18:24.535
I don't have a middle name.

18:24.537 --> 18:25.970
GAIL: Oh, that makes it easy.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.138
So this is Phil,

18:27.140 --> 18:29.040
and this is Tandy.

18:29.042 --> 18:30.775
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:30.777 --> 18:31.876
I'm Phil.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.211
Okay, maybe we should

18:33.213 --> 18:35.146
find some kind of competition
or something.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.215
You know, something we're both
equally good at.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.149
Fine by me.
Okay.

18:38.151 --> 18:40.151
How about a game of, uh,

18:40.153 --> 18:41.719
hm, hm, uh, Jenga.

18:41.721 --> 18:42.720
Never heard of that.

18:42.722 --> 18:43.721
Yeah, neither have I.

18:43.723 --> 18:44.789
So Jenga it is.

19:05.911 --> 19:07.111
Boom.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.013
(Carol laughs)

19:09.015 --> 19:11.149
(clears throat)

19:13.919 --> 19:15.820
Too easy.
PHIL 2: Mm-hmm.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.257
If I do this, you're gonna
do that, then do that.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.691
Where are you,
my little sweet?

19:22.194 --> 19:23.094
Excuse me.

19:23.096 --> 19:24.195
PHIL 2:
Mm.

19:29.635 --> 19:31.836
(inhaling)

19:33.272 --> 19:35.039
What in the hell, Phil?
Let's go.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.042
You should enjoy this, Phil.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.444
This might be the last time
somebody calls you Phil.

19:40.446 --> 19:41.846
I hate to disappoint you,

19:41.848 --> 19:44.348
but I'm about to set in motion

19:44.350 --> 19:46.551
a chain of events
that will leave you shamed,

19:46.553 --> 19:49.787
tamed and without a name.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.956
ALL:
Oh!

19:51.958 --> 19:54.125
Well...

19:54.127 --> 19:56.360
good game, Tandy.

20:02.067 --> 20:03.067
Hey, Carol...?

20:03.069 --> 20:06.037
Where'd this door come from?

20:06.039 --> 20:07.638
(door closes)

20:07.640 --> 20:09.640
Oh.

20:10.676 --> 20:12.476
Why you all dressed up?

20:12.478 --> 20:15.012
Oh, this?

20:15.014 --> 20:17.215
Oh, it's just how I do.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.083
How about that door, huh?

20:19.085 --> 20:20.384
Phil installed it.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.320
Well, it's a... a little wonky.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.821
Uh, hey, could you

20:23.823 --> 20:25.423
rub some salve
on my back for me?

20:25.425 --> 20:26.824
Hm, sorry.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.526
I can't right now.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.261
Oh.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.996
Where you going?

20:31.998 --> 20:34.699
Oh, I'm just taking
a thank-you gift to Phil

20:34.701 --> 20:35.766
for fixing my door.

20:35.768 --> 20:36.867
Oh, you made him
some raisin balls?

20:36.869 --> 20:38.102
No, apple pie

20:38.104 --> 20:39.537
with homemade crème fraîche.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.606
There's raisin balls in
the kitchen, if you want them.

20:42.841 --> 20:43.908
Carol?

20:45.377 --> 20:48.079
The apple pie,

20:48.081 --> 20:49.747
the-the makeup, the clothes--

20:49.749 --> 20:51.849
you like this guy?

20:51.851 --> 20:54.018
(chuckles) You jealous?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.186
(scoffs)
Of course not.

20:55.188 --> 20:56.420
You know, we're divorced,

20:56.422 --> 20:59.423
and you have the right
to do whatever you want.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.759
Oh, I know.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.695
Good, okay, well...

21:04.697 --> 21:06.230
good night, Carol.

21:06.232 --> 21:08.332
Good night, Tandy.

21:09.534 --> 21:11.602
(door closes)

21:14.473 --> 21:19.810
