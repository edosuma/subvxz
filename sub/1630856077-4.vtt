02:42.224 --> 02:44.529
I want to know
what Darby thinks.

02:50.575 --> 02:52.645
I think it was a heart attack.

02:53.747 --> 02:56.352
Well, no, I-I think it was...

02:56.352 --> 02:58.558
heart failure.

02:58.558 --> 03:00.995
Rohan told me
that he had a pacemaker.

03:00.995 --> 03:04.570
Um, the surgery, I think,
was a few years ago.

03:04.570 --> 03:08.276
And any pacemaker made after
2011 has a wireless interface.

03:08.276 --> 03:10.648
So Rohan had an attack surface.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.986
[Ziba]
Uh, sorry, I don't get it.

03:12.986 --> 03:14.890
Well, Marius was also
looking for Rohan.

03:14.890 --> 03:17.596
He wanted to tell him

03:17.596 --> 03:20.033
that he had an urgent
phone call from Heartfront.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.506
They make pacemakers?

03:22.506 --> 03:24.710
They manufacture pacemakers.

03:24.710 --> 03:27.682
So my guess is that they were
calling to warn him

03:27.682 --> 03:30.755
that his pacemaker
had been hacked.

03:30.755 --> 03:32.592
[Martin]
Is that even possible?

03:32.592 --> 03:35.430
- [both] Yeah.
- [Ziba] Then we can
trace it back

03:35.430 --> 03:37.669
- to an I.P. address, right?
- [Lee] It's not that simple.

03:37.669 --> 03:39.907
Uh, you need specialized
RF hardware

03:39.907 --> 03:41.811
or you would need
to modify a pacemaker

03:41.811 --> 03:43.514

03:43.514 --> 03:45.585
[Lu Mei]
Yes, my father
had one of those at home.

03:45.585 --> 03:47.488

48:50.324 --> 48:52.696
Wait. Wait, I-I don't
want morphine.

48:52.696 --> 48:55.668
It's just one milligram,
for the pain.

48:57.639 --> 48:58.674
It's all right.

49:00.512 --> 49:02.550

It's not coming off.
- The light's coming on.

It's gonna be okay. Now I'm
just gluing this laceration.

49:12.235 --> 49:15.208
What the fuck were you doing?

49:15.208 --> 49:17.212
It's not... Her-her helmet's
jammed or something.

49:17.212 --> 49:19.115
- It's not responding.
- [Sian] It won't release.

49:22.088 --> 49:24.326
[Andy]
You're in manual override?

49:24.326 --> 49:27.766
- [Sian] Of course.
- What does the readout say?

49:27.766 --> 49:30.238
[Sian]
"Helmet sealed."

49:30.238 --> 49:31.674
[Andy]
How much oxygen?

49:33.645 --> 49:35.982
Two minutes.

49:47.238 --> 49:49.342
[keyboard clicking]

49:52.081 --> 49:53.284
[Sian]
Is this a hack?

49:53.284 --> 49:54.520
[Andy]
You need to sit down.

49:54.520 --> 49:55.722
Conserve air.

49:58.427 --> 50:00.163
Down.

50:03.303 --> 50:05.207
- [grunts]
- [Marius] [whispering]
Sian's helmet won't come off.

50:05.207 --> 50:06.744
It's in manual. We can't get it.

50:06.744 --> 50:08.614
She only has three minutes
of oxygen left.

50:12.856 --> 50:14.225
[beeps]

50:15.260 --> 50:17.566
Can we thread oxygen
through the gap?

50:17.566 --> 50:21.373
There is no gap. It's sealed
for chemical attacks.

50:21.373 --> 50:23.578
- You could hit her skull.
- [Sian] I'll take my chances.

50:23.578 --> 50:26.082
- Hold still.
- [drill whirring]

50:32.529 --> 50:34.432
- [whirring stops]
- [grunts] Nothing doing.

50:34.432 --> 50:35.768
[Sian]
One minute.

50:39.475 --> 50:41.514
Okay. Lie back.

50:41.514 --> 50:43.116
Brace yourself.

50:47.258 --> 50:51.199
We need to do
an emergency tracheotomy.

50:51.199 --> 50:52.836
- Have you done one before?
- No.

50:52.836 --> 50:55.240
- Only in school.
- Quick.

50:59.683 --> 51:02.421
- You're gonna put her under?
- No. There's no time.

51:04.459 --> 51:06.196
Try to relax.

51:06.196 --> 51:08.133
[Eva]
Okay. Hold that, hold that.

51:08.935 --> 51:10.605
[Andy]
Do it.

51:10.605 --> 51:13.276
[Eva] I'm just trying to
avoid hitting her vocal cords.

51:14.345 --> 51:15.414
[Andy]
Do it.

51:15.414 --> 51:17.451
- [panting]
- Come on, Eva.

Hey.

52:17.873 --> 52:19.543
You feel okay?

52:19.543 --> 52:22.816
How you doing?

52:22.816 --> 52:24.553
Where's Sian?

52:24.553 --> 52:28.661
She's all right.
She's in her room recovering.

52:29.930 --> 52:33.236
I'm sorry I have to keep waking
you. It's for the concussion.

52:35.007 --> 52:37.411
I'm gonna let you
go back to sleep.

Get off.
