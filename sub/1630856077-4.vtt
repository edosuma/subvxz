00:10.922 --> 00:15.330
<i>Previously on</i> A Murder
at the End of the World...

00:16.432 --> 00:17.636
I hacked the doorbell cameras.

00:17.636 --> 00:19.272
Do you think I don't know that?

00:19.272 --> 00:21.142
<i>It's a conference of hackers.</i>

00:21.142 --> 00:22.813
[Ziba]
<i>It's no secret
that I came to Iceland</i>

00:22.813 --> 00:24.449
for Bill Farrah.

00:24.449 --> 00:25.719
[Marta] She found a silver pin
in the back seat.

00:25.719 --> 00:26.854
[Darby]
Probably belonged

00:26.854 --> 00:28.825
to his previous victim.

00:28.825 --> 00:30.595
[Andy]
<i>Did you know that Bill
was around</i>

00:30.595 --> 00:32.198
when Lee was in Florida?

00:32.198 --> 00:33.367
[Darby]
Were you having an affair?

00:33.367 --> 00:34.703
[Lee]
No. We hooked up once.

00:34.703 --> 00:36.641
[Darby]
<i>So who here knew Bill?</i>

00:36.641 --> 00:38.778
Rohan, I think?

00:38.778 --> 00:40.649
[Ray]
<i>There is no available
information about Rohan Ravjit</i>

00:40.649 --> 00:42.451
<i>after 2006.</i>

00:42.451 --> 00:44.455
<i>And the vessel</i> Last Chance
<i>has no entries</i>

00:44.455 --> 00:47.228
<i>- in maritime databases
since 2006.</i>
- Careful, girl.

00:47.228 --> 00:48.831
[Darby]
<i>They're covering
something up here.</i>

00:48.831 --> 00:50.467
[Tomas]
<i>Whatever happens here</i>

00:50.467 --> 00:51.837
is so secretive.

00:51.837 --> 00:53.373
<i>They want staff who don't talk.</i>

00:53.373 --> 00:55.210
[Andy]
<i>You grew up on crime scenes,</i>

00:55.210 --> 00:57.649
<i>and you think this is one, too.</i>

00:57.649 --> 00:59.887
- It's not.
- [Sian] <i>Don't bite the hand</i>

00:59.887 --> 01:01.356
<i>that might feed you.</i>

01:01.356 --> 01:02.559
[Rohan]
<i>We had a plan,</i>

01:02.559 --> 01:04.128
<i>but Bill uncovered a secret.</i>

01:04.128 --> 01:06.232
<i>I think I know
what he uncovered.</i>

01:06.232 --> 01:07.703
[clattering over phone]

01:07.703 --> 01:09.138
- [Darby] Rohan?
- [woman crying]

01:11.677 --> 01:12.679
[Sian]
No pulse.

01:12.679 --> 01:14.348
He's dead.

01:15.484 --> 01:17.188
[Andy]
Todd.

01:17.188 --> 01:19.191
Get everyone underground.

01:26.272 --> 01:28.711
[Zoomer crying]

01:37.529 --> 01:39.533
[Lee shushing]

01:39.533 --> 01:41.671
[Lee]
It's all right. It's all right.

01:41.671 --> 01:44.342
[whispers indistinctly]

01:44.342 --> 01:46.580
We're just going downstairs.
It's gonna be all right.

01:46.580 --> 01:48.651
[Marius]
Everyone, this way.

01:48.651 --> 01:50.353
- [Lee] We're going
to a safe place, okay?
- [Marius] Please come.

01:58.804 --> 02:00.206
Here we go, buddy.
Come on, come on.

02:07.956 --> 02:09.693
[indistinct whispering]

02:09.693 --> 02:12.833
- I'll be back.
- [David] Wait, wait. Wait.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.839
- What's the plan here?
- Todd is going to assess
the situation,

02:15.839 --> 02:18.477
he will be back,
and there will be a plan.

02:18.477 --> 02:20.180
[Lee]
It's my fault.

02:20.180 --> 02:22.719
- I invited him.
- [exhales] Don't say that.

02:22.719 --> 02:24.957
[Ziba]
Just take a deep breath.

02:24.957 --> 02:27.863
Has someone come here
to kill us all one by one?

02:27.863 --> 02:30.434
- We don't even know
what happened to Rohan yet.
- [Lu Mei] She's right.

02:30.434 --> 02:33.574
He stumbled into the bar,
clutching his chest.

02:33.574 --> 02:35.210
It looked like heart attack.

02:35.210 --> 02:36.647
[David]
Oh, really?

02:36.647 --> 02:39.318
Then why are we
six stories underground

02:39.318 --> 02:42.224
in a concrete room
if the man had a heart attack?

02:42.224 --> 02:44.529
I want to know
what Darby thinks.

02:50.575 --> 02:52.645
I think it was a heart attack.

02:53.747 --> 02:56.352
Well, no, I-I think it was...

02:56.352 --> 02:58.558
heart failure.

02:58.558 --> 03:00.995
Rohan told me
that he had a pacemaker.

03:00.995 --> 03:04.570
Um, the surgery, I think,
was a few years ago.

03:04.570 --> 03:08.276
And any pacemaker made after
2011 has a wireless interface.

03:08.276 --> 03:10.648
So Rohan had an attack surface.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.986
[Ziba]
Uh, sorry, I don't get it.

03:12.986 --> 03:14.890
Well, Marius was also
looking for Rohan.

03:14.890 --> 03:17.596
He wanted to tell him

03:17.596 --> 03:20.033
that he had an urgent
phone call from Heartfront.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.506
They make pacemakers?

03:22.506 --> 03:24.710
They manufacture pacemakers.

03:24.710 --> 03:27.682
So my guess is that they were
calling to warn him

03:27.682 --> 03:30.755
that his pacemaker
had been hacked.

03:30.755 --> 03:32.592
[Martin]
Is that even possible?

03:32.592 --> 03:35.430
- [both] Yeah.
- [Ziba] Then we can
trace it back

03:35.430 --> 03:37.669
- to an I.P. address, right?
- [Lee] It's not that simple.

03:37.669 --> 03:39.907
Uh, you need specialized
RF hardware

03:39.907 --> 03:41.811
or you would need
to modify a pacemaker

03:41.811 --> 03:43.514
home monitoring system.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.585
[Lu Mei]
Yes, my father
had one of those at home.

03:45.585 --> 03:47.488
Hospitals have them.

03:47.488 --> 03:50.628
But I doubt Rohan
would have brought his.

03:50.628 --> 03:52.599
[Lee]
Eva?

03:52.599 --> 03:54.770
We don't have one of those,
do we?

03:54.770 --> 03:56.706
In the medical suite?

03:59.078 --> 04:01.415
We do.

04:02.685 --> 04:04.556
Normally, I keep it
in a cabinet.

04:04.556 --> 04:07.629
But today,
when I came into the suite,

04:07.629 --> 04:10.768
someone had taken it out,

04:10.768 --> 04:13.439
plugged it in and turned it on.

04:18.651 --> 04:20.019
[knocking]

04:21.088 --> 04:23.727
[door beeps, opens]

04:26.399 --> 04:28.670
Well?

04:30.407 --> 04:32.779
Police can't get here
with the storm closing in.

04:32.779 --> 04:36.554
It's gonna be at least 48 hours.
Probably 72.

04:36.554 --> 04:38.858
That's okay.

04:38.858 --> 04:41.931
We're prepared to be snowed in.
These things happen here.

04:41.931 --> 04:44.703
- And the cause of death?
- House EMT confirmed

04:44.703 --> 04:48.376
most likely a heart attack.

04:48.376 --> 04:51.716
Marius, have you spoken
to Heartfront?

04:54.856 --> 04:57.562
- Really?
- [Martin] Come on.

04:57.562 --> 04:59.065
[David]
Why can't we just
leave right now?

04:59.065 --> 05:00.668
There's been an avalanche
at the pass

05:00.668 --> 05:01.871
where the storm's already hit.

05:01.871 --> 05:03.741
What about your,
uh, security detail

05:03.741 --> 05:06.079
- in SiglufjÃ¶rdur?
- [Lu Mei] What can they do
for us

05:06.079 --> 05:08.083
if the roads and sky
are impassable?

05:08.083 --> 05:09.853
Where the fuck is Andy?

05:09.853 --> 05:12.759
Trying to sort this all out.
From a secure location.

05:12.759 --> 05:14.529
Andy's not the only
valuable person here.

05:14.529 --> 05:16.800
You can't just keep us trapped
in this goddamn room.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.771
[Todd]
Of course not.
We are going to ensure

05:18.771 --> 05:20.675
- everybody's safety.
- [Oliver] Oh, you've done
an amazing job

05:20.675 --> 05:23.079
- of that so far.
- [chuckles]

05:23.079 --> 05:24.683
[David]
Oh, I get it.

05:24.683 --> 05:27.354
You think you're keeping him
safe from us.

05:31.128 --> 05:34.536
What are you, what are you doing
with Rohan's body?

05:36.673 --> 05:39.378
I suppose we should move it
into the walk-in refrigerator.

05:39.378 --> 05:41.449
[Darby]
No. No, no,
please don't do that.

05:41.449 --> 05:42.852
If you do that,
you'd be destroying

05:42.852 --> 05:44.422
valuable trace evidence.

05:44.422 --> 05:45.959
I mean, if no one's
gonna look at it

05:45.959 --> 05:47.796
for the next 72 hours,
you've-you've got to let me.

05:47.796 --> 05:50.535
I can take notes, I'll pass
them along to the coroner.

05:50.535 --> 05:52.104
- You fucking millennials.
- David.

05:52.104 --> 05:53.139
[Martin]
She's not even a millennial,
you asshole.

05:53.139 --> 05:54.676
I'm a millennial. She's a--

05:54.676 --> 05:56.513
Whatever. Children
of the fucking Internet.

05:56.513 --> 05:59.018
No one's examining any bodies
until Interpol arrives.

05:59.018 --> 06:02.091
It's not
<i>Lord of the</i> goddamn <i>Flies.</i>

06:02.091 --> 06:05.163
- Everything's okay.
- [Lu Mei] It would be
a clever plot, wouldn't it?

06:05.163 --> 06:07.869
To lure some of your greatest competition

06:07.869 --> 06:11.510
and sharpest critics
into a remote location

06:11.510 --> 06:13.648
and then dispatch of them
one by one in a superstorm?

06:13.648 --> 06:15.618
[Martin]
The billionaire's largess

06:15.618 --> 06:17.121
- as a Venus flytrap.
- [Ziba] I need
my cell phone back.

06:17.121 --> 06:19.593
[David] You know what
we need right now, we need

06:19.593 --> 06:21.630
- the fucking
satellite phone, okay?
- [overlapping chatter]

06:21.630 --> 06:24.135
We are not prisoners here.
You cannot keep us here. Now.

06:24.135 --> 06:27.141
[overlapping chatter continues]

06:27.141 --> 06:30.013
[Todd] Listen up.
Security has finished the sweep.

06:30.013 --> 06:32.986
We've been cleared
to go back upstairs,

06:32.986 --> 06:36.192
but you are all going
into lockdown in your rooms.

06:36.192 --> 06:38.564
Meals will be brought to you.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.467
As we know more about
when help will arrive

06:40.467 --> 06:44.776
and when we can depart,
we will let you know.

06:44.776 --> 06:48.583
We will get through this, okay?

06:50.253 --> 06:52.157
- Together.
- [chuckles]

06:52.157 --> 06:55.631
Sorry, but how can we do
anything together?

06:55.631 --> 06:58.203
We don't know who did this,

06:58.203 --> 07:02.679
we don't know why and
we don't know if they are done.

07:02.679 --> 07:04.916
[Todd]
It's how Andy wants it.

07:07.922 --> 07:09.926
[door beeps, opens]

07:14.703 --> 07:16.539
[wind whistling]

07:18.510 --> 07:19.680
[Sian]
<i>Someone will be
patrolling, right?</i>

07:19.680 --> 07:21.049
[Todd]
All night.

07:21.049 --> 07:24.488
After we finish
dropping off guests.

07:24.488 --> 07:25.925
Good night.

07:25.925 --> 07:28.597
And sorry, Sian,
I'm gonna need your laptop,

07:28.597 --> 07:30.868
iPad, any electronics you got.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.638
You're kidding.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.654
Thanks.

07:47.702 --> 07:48.904
[door chimes]

08:05.236 --> 08:07.641
âª âª

08:10.948 --> 08:12.752
I don't have my Ring.

08:12.752 --> 08:13.987
Oh, yeah.

08:15.156 --> 08:16.559
[door chimes]

08:21.903 --> 08:22.905
Your electronics.

08:25.811 --> 08:28.650
Internet's shut down
till after the storm anyway.

08:49.726 --> 08:51.763
[drops bag]

08:59.378 --> 09:02.016
âª âª

09:09.298 --> 09:11.936
âª âª

09:21.055 --> 09:22.658
[gasps]

09:28.035 --> 09:30.040
- Can I come in a sec?
- Are you vi or Emacs?

09:30.040 --> 09:31.342
What?

09:31.342 --> 09:35.150
It's a, it's a hacker thing.

09:35.150 --> 09:36.954
If you don't have
a visceral reaction,

09:36.954 --> 09:39.358
then you're not a hacker.

09:39.358 --> 09:43.165
So, you're not the killer.
Yeah, come in.

09:49.244 --> 09:50.781
I'm sorry, what's <i>vmacs?</i>

09:50.781 --> 09:55.156
Emacs, uh,
it's, uh, it's a text editor.

09:55.156 --> 09:56.894
So, if you wrote code
for computers,

09:56.894 --> 09:59.900
then you were either
die-hard vi or Emacs.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.070
It was like a holy war
between the two.

10:02.070 --> 10:05.811
Anyway, what do you want?

10:06.813 --> 10:09.686
I owe you an apology.

10:09.686 --> 10:14.195
You felt something was wrong,
off, when Bill died.

10:14.195 --> 10:16.265
In my gut,
I felt you were right,

10:16.265 --> 10:19.639
I really did, but I overrode it.

10:20.908 --> 10:24.749
Because you're...
you're very young.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.821
[laughs softly]
And a girl, you mean.

10:31.495 --> 10:32.999
And a girl.

10:32.999 --> 10:34.936
Mm.

10:34.936 --> 10:36.773
I'm sorry, Darby.

10:36.773 --> 10:38.711
I really am.

10:38.711 --> 10:41.750
If I had stood by you when you
said Bill's death was foul play,

10:41.750 --> 10:44.321
we might not be
in this situation.

10:44.321 --> 10:46.392
But I'm here now.

10:46.392 --> 10:49.031
If you want to see Rohan's body,
I can help you.

10:49.031 --> 10:51.202
How can you help me?

10:51.202 --> 10:53.406
I spent a lot of time with Andy
when he was building this place.

10:53.406 --> 10:57.114
I know how it works.
How its security functions.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.416
What about Todd?

10:58.416 --> 10:59.852
Fuck Todd.

11:02.023 --> 11:04.294
Fuck Todd.

11:05.864 --> 11:07.333
What about Andy?

11:10.173 --> 11:12.076
He should have listened
to you, too.

11:18.757 --> 11:21.395
Blind the cameras as you go by.

11:30.246 --> 11:32.785
[man] I'll check the dining
room and the rest of level two.

11:32.785 --> 11:34.421
- You check level one.
- Let's go.

11:34.421 --> 11:35.857
[man 2] Copy that.

11:43.372 --> 11:45.811
âª âª

11:53.392 --> 11:54.996
[man]
I'll check the baking area.

11:54.996 --> 11:57.034
- You go to the lobby.
- [chatter over radio]

11:57.034 --> 11:59.104
[door opens, closes]

12:15.403 --> 12:17.440
âª âª

12:32.303 --> 12:34.341
[lights buzzing]

12:58.523 --> 13:01.261
[Darby]
Who did this to you, Rohan?

13:10.948 --> 13:12.885
See?

13:12.885 --> 13:14.855
That's it.

13:18.028 --> 13:20.934
Incision
in the deltopectoral groove.

13:21.903 --> 13:24.609
He was chipped.

13:24.609 --> 13:27.314
How does the hack work?

13:27.314 --> 13:31.957
Well, the hacker uploads
software updates to the cloud

13:31.957 --> 13:33.961
and the pacemaker
downloads a pattern

13:33.961 --> 13:37.234
of fatal shocks to the heart.

13:37.234 --> 13:39.405
Jesus Christ.

13:39.405 --> 13:41.174
Yeah, it's dark.

14:00.514 --> 14:03.118
It's a signaling device.

14:19.519 --> 14:22.558
Rohan told me that him
and Bill had a plan,

14:22.558 --> 14:25.430
and I don't know
what it was, but...

14:25.430 --> 14:28.002
but one night I followed Rohan
out of the hotel,

14:28.002 --> 14:30.941
through this canyon to a bluff.

14:30.941 --> 14:34.916
He started signaling
into the dark.

14:34.916 --> 14:37.120
And someone signaled back.

14:37.120 --> 14:40.059
What the fuck?

14:40.059 --> 14:43.098
I-I think there's something
going on here that...

14:45.069 --> 14:46.606
...that we don't
fully understand.

14:46.606 --> 14:49.111
So we find who's at
the other end of the light.

14:49.111 --> 14:51.248
- In this blizzard?
- I've walked on the dark side

14:51.248 --> 14:55.023
of the Moon in
minus 175 degrees Celsius.

14:55.023 --> 14:57.426
I can handle
a fucking snowstorm.

15:07.648 --> 15:09.685
âª âª

15:17.601 --> 15:19.638
[soft beeping]

15:21.609 --> 15:22.978
Perfect.

15:24.682 --> 15:26.452
[Darby]
What are they?

15:26.452 --> 15:29.290
Climate suits
for new Earth extremes.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.301
They're kind of like
space suits,

15:34.301 --> 15:36.038
only Andy had them designed

15:36.038 --> 15:40.446
in case of radiation
or biochemical poisoning.

15:40.446 --> 15:42.050
[news reporter]
<i>...of Iceland is heading west.
This storm...</i>

15:42.050 --> 15:44.522
For the end of the world, basically.

15:44.522 --> 15:47.595
<i>...two to four inches of snow
per hour overnight tonight.</i>

15:47.595 --> 15:49.464
The superstorm
hit ReykjavÃ­k already.

15:49.464 --> 15:51.603
We have about three hours.

15:51.603 --> 15:53.472
- We have to move fast.
- [news reporter 2]
<i>Plunging temperatures</i>

15:53.472 --> 15:56.045
<i>have brought significant travel
disruption across Europe,</i>

15:56.045 --> 15:59.418
<i>- with dozens of flights...</i>
- Along that river, there,

15:59.418 --> 16:01.756
that's where Rohan
came through the canyon

16:01.756 --> 16:05.296
to that bluff there,
signaling southeast.

16:05.296 --> 16:07.167
If we leave now
we can make it there and back

16:07.167 --> 16:09.772
- before the winds hit.
<i>- This Arctic snowstorm is...</i>

16:09.772 --> 16:12.277
And if we find who Rohan
was signaling to,

16:12.277 --> 16:15.283
maybe we can figure out
what he and Bill were planning.

16:15.283 --> 16:17.788
[news reporter] <i>Some countries,
like France and Germany,</i>

16:17.788 --> 16:21.161
<i>are dealing with crippling
snowstorms and blizzards.</i>

16:21.161 --> 16:24.602
<i>Rescuers are warning visitors
to simply stay away.</i>

16:24.602 --> 16:27.107
I can go alone,
tell you what I find.

16:27.107 --> 16:29.244
I'd rather not wait in my room
for someone

16:29.244 --> 16:31.750
to come inject me
with morphine in my sleep.

16:31.750 --> 16:34.020
Good.

16:35.356 --> 16:37.460
[engine revving]

16:40.433 --> 16:42.436
âª âª

17:06.586 --> 17:08.089
[engine stops]

17:08.089 --> 17:09.559
- [helmet beeps]
- [grunts]

17:09.559 --> 17:11.095
[air hisses]

17:11.095 --> 17:12.664
This is it.

17:17.473 --> 17:19.444
So, everyone's a suspect?

17:19.444 --> 17:22.652
Like Andy said, it's basically
a conference of hackers.

17:22.652 --> 17:24.420
It's around here.

17:28.329 --> 17:30.433
[Sian]
But Bill was injected
with morphine.

17:30.433 --> 17:32.203
That's not a hack.

17:32.203 --> 17:34.408
No, but whoever murdered Bill

17:34.408 --> 17:37.113
knew how to break
the hotel's security protocol

17:37.113 --> 17:39.552
and delete themselves
from the footage.

17:39.552 --> 17:41.255
And that is a hack.
[chuckles]

17:41.255 --> 17:44.461
[Sian]
Well, Lu Mei has
the strongest motive,

17:44.461 --> 17:45.798
because Bill's
<i>Artificial Insanity</i>

17:45.798 --> 17:48.269
was a takedown of smart cities.

17:48.269 --> 17:50.373
Why was Lu Mei even invited?

17:50.373 --> 17:52.712
I thought her work
was a direct rival of Andy's.

17:52.712 --> 17:56.418
Andy sees his work as peerless.

17:56.418 --> 17:58.657
I get a bad feeling from David.

17:58.657 --> 18:02.765
If David was going to kill
someone, it would be Lee.

18:02.765 --> 18:04.569
Why?

18:04.569 --> 18:08.442
Because she stole
Andy's focus from David.

18:10.413 --> 18:12.283
The moment Lee got pregnant,

18:12.283 --> 18:15.724
all Andy cared about
was starting his family.

18:15.724 --> 18:17.159
Zoomer is his life.

18:38.937 --> 18:40.273
[Darby]
Here.

18:40.273 --> 18:43.613
Rohan did it here.

18:47.320 --> 18:48.456
SOS?

18:48.456 --> 18:50.393
Yeah.

18:50.393 --> 18:52.297
Morse code's
pretty old-fashioned.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.869
Yeah, some dads read
their kids bedtime stories,

18:54.869 --> 18:56.906
mine taught me military code.

18:56.906 --> 19:00.313
That's funny.
My dad taught me Morse, too.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.450
He was an astronomer.
Fought in the Gulf war.

19:02.450 --> 19:04.689
Where is he now?

19:04.689 --> 19:07.794
He gassed himself to death
in the garage when I was 13.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.874
God. That fucking sucks.

19:13.874 --> 19:16.846
Yeah. It really did.

19:16.846 --> 19:18.850
People talk a lot about
how terrible it is

19:18.850 --> 19:22.558
to be a woman in this world,
and it is terrible.

19:22.558 --> 19:24.562
I don't have to tell <i>you</i> that.

19:24.562 --> 19:27.434
You're picking up their bones.

19:27.434 --> 19:30.440
But the other half's
got it bad, too.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.878
Hard to be made into a killer

19:32.878 --> 19:37.788
when all you wanted to do
was look up at the stars.

19:42.931 --> 19:45.369
I think we have to go there.

19:57.928 --> 20:00.834
[Darby]
I think Bill uncovered something
his first night here.

20:00.834 --> 20:05.276
A secret. I think that's why
he was late to dinner.

20:05.276 --> 20:07.581
Why he was acting so strange,

20:07.581 --> 20:10.687
why he asked me to come
to his room.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.456
He really needed to talk.

20:16.064 --> 20:18.035
[Sian]
So what do you think
the secret is?

20:18.035 --> 20:19.906
[Darby]
I don't know.

20:19.906 --> 20:22.945
But it must be connected
to whatever plan they have.

20:22.945 --> 20:25.015
To Rohan's signal.

20:27.486 --> 20:29.525
[wind gusting]

20:31.996 --> 20:33.398
[low rumble]

20:50.534 --> 20:52.571
âª âª

21:11.809 --> 21:13.779
[beeping, air hisses]

21:40.800 --> 21:43.338
[Darby]
There's nothing out here.

22:04.414 --> 22:06.652
[Sian]
Ropes going into the water.

22:27.728 --> 22:29.565
[Darby]
<i>Last Chance.</i>

22:29.565 --> 22:31.067
That's the name of Rohan's boat.

22:33.038 --> 22:35.075
[thunder rumbling]

22:46.699 --> 22:48.803
- It's a zodiac.
- What's a zodiac?

22:48.803 --> 22:50.807
An inflatable boat
you take to reach a ship

22:50.807 --> 22:53.579
too big to come to shore.

22:59.490 --> 23:03.667
Probably in a hurry
to head south before the storm.

23:03.667 --> 23:06.739
Rohan didn't check in
last night.

23:06.739 --> 23:09.711
And the boat is off the grid.

23:11.716 --> 23:14.054
We have to go.

23:14.054 --> 23:15.657
Come on. Let's go.

23:27.514 --> 23:30.988
[Darby]
Rohan signaled
"One down, still a go."

23:30.988 --> 23:34.060
[Sian]
It sounds to me
like they lost a man. Bill.

23:34.060 --> 23:37.000
The plan was to carry on.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.206
Yeah, but carry on with what?

23:40.206 --> 23:42.042
[Sian]
I don't know.

23:45.082 --> 23:47.119
âª âª

24:02.951 --> 24:06.926
[engine stalling]

24:06.926 --> 24:08.529
[Sian]
Oh, shit.

24:09.732 --> 24:12.537
- [Darby] What?
- [ignition clicking]

24:13.840 --> 24:15.042
What?

24:16.077 --> 24:17.213
[Sian]
It's the engine.

24:17.213 --> 24:19.150
- Fuck.
- [Darby] The engine?

24:21.822 --> 24:24.528
[ignition clicking]

24:24.528 --> 24:26.566
It's a clogged pilot jet.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.302
Huh?

24:28.302 --> 24:31.108
Listen to me, we're gonna
be okay in these suits, okay?

24:31.108 --> 24:32.745
- We're not far.
- Yeah.

24:32.745 --> 24:35.049
Look at me. But we need to walk.

24:35.049 --> 24:36.753
- [Darby] Walk?
- Yes.

24:36.753 --> 24:37.955
[Sian]
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

24:37.955 --> 24:40.025
Stay close.

24:48.208 --> 24:50.245
âª âª

25:12.757 --> 25:14.961
[both breathing heavily]

25:23.378 --> 25:25.584
[Darby]
Wait. Is that...

25:25.584 --> 25:27.821
The guard shack.

25:32.964 --> 25:34.868
Is that what I think it is?

25:48.128 --> 25:50.634
[beeps, air hisses]

[beeps, air hisses]

25:53.940 --> 25:56.678
[both panting]

25:59.016 --> 26:00.653
All right.

26:02.791 --> 26:04.728
All we need now is a key.

26:15.750 --> 26:17.687
[Sian exhales]

26:27.373 --> 26:29.109
[Sian]
An OBD terminal.

26:47.714 --> 26:49.417
[engine starts]

26:49.417 --> 26:51.120
[Sian exhales]

26:53.893 --> 26:56.331
- A hack?
- [laughs softly]

26:56.331 --> 26:58.869
I do know my way
around vehicle command.

27:02.076 --> 27:03.813
Okay.

27:03.813 --> 27:05.449
[oldies play over radio]

[music fades]

27:48.970 --> 27:51.173
[tires skidding]

27:58.321 --> 28:00.425
That's a lot of black ice.

28:02.797 --> 28:05.135
- Sure we shouldn't walk?
- No.

28:06.304 --> 28:08.308
Not in this storm.

28:11.381 --> 28:16.324
So, you think what Bill
uncovered is connected to Andy?

28:16.324 --> 28:18.128
I don't know.

28:18.128 --> 28:21.434
I just think it's weird.

28:21.434 --> 28:24.373
I mean, why wasn't Andy
in the safe room?

28:26.277 --> 28:28.382
He's humiliated.

28:28.382 --> 28:30.520
He hates losing control.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.056
[scoffs]

28:32.056 --> 28:35.362
But I mean, why is there
even a safe room?

28:35.362 --> 28:38.168
These climate suits?

28:38.168 --> 28:41.308
What is this place, really?

28:41.308 --> 28:45.316
Andy has run a lot
of climate projections.

28:45.316 --> 28:50.059
He thinks the extremes slated
for 2050 are coming sooner.

28:50.059 --> 28:52.296
A lot sooner.

28:52.296 --> 28:54.167
He wants to be prepared
for that.

28:54.167 --> 28:56.004
Why hasn't he released
that information to the public?

28:56.004 --> 28:57.440
People listen to him.

28:57.440 --> 29:00.379
If you're on a plane
that is about to crash,

29:00.379 --> 29:02.249
should one of the pilots
really tell you

29:02.249 --> 29:04.855
how many minutes until impact?

29:04.855 --> 29:07.493
Especially if there's
nothing you can do?

29:07.493 --> 29:10.099
Hundreds of millions of people
are going to die.

29:10.099 --> 29:13.372
- Millions are dying already...
- I think there are things
you can do.

29:13.372 --> 29:16.111
You can eat less meat,
you can stop driving a car.

29:16.111 --> 29:18.115
All good, yes.

29:18.115 --> 29:21.488
But it has to be so much bigger,
so much faster than that.

29:21.488 --> 29:25.062
There's too much money in coal,
oil, industrial agriculture.

29:25.062 --> 29:27.066
No one is gonna leave that
on the table.

29:27.066 --> 29:30.940
And they all think technology
is going to save them.

29:30.940 --> 29:32.443
Well, what does
the King of Tech think?

29:32.443 --> 29:36.551
It will not... save all of them.

29:39.223 --> 29:41.562
I'll tell you this,
but you cannot repeat it,

29:41.562 --> 29:43.364
if we get out of here alive.

29:45.903 --> 29:48.576
Ronson Industries' coffers
are dry.

29:48.576 --> 29:50.345
The funding
for his space program

29:50.345 --> 29:53.418
has been completely drained.

29:53.418 --> 29:57.326
Andy made me the face
of an empty PR campaign.

29:57.326 --> 29:59.965
I don't think
he's sending anyone to space.

29:59.965 --> 30:03.940
I think he's been draining
the funds for something else.

30:03.940 --> 30:06.077
Probably this place,
but he won't say why.

30:06.077 --> 30:07.480
And neither will we.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.152
I wish I'd gone to Bill's room
that night.

30:10.152 --> 30:13.224
He would've told me everything.

30:16.197 --> 30:18.468
- [tires skidding]
- Shit.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.150
No...

[tires screech]

âª âª

31:37.694 --> 31:39.263
Ow.

31:47.012 --> 31:51.688
I guess today we'll find out
if this is Carmen Perez's pin.

31:56.632 --> 31:59.605
[Darby] We're meeting Sue
at the morgue at 11:00.

31:59.605 --> 32:01.541
Take me to coffee?

32:07.419 --> 32:10.092
[Sue]
<i>These are the two
I was telling you about.</i>

32:10.092 --> 32:12.062
<i>Came up yesterday,</i>

32:12.062 --> 32:15.302
<i>so thanks for coming,
pulling this together for us.</i>

32:15.302 --> 32:17.541
Sue says you have
dental records?

32:17.541 --> 32:20.613
[Darby]
Uh, yeah. Here.

32:24.286 --> 32:26.090
[clears throat]

32:44.527 --> 32:45.729
- This is your girl.
- [Sue exclaims]

32:48.134 --> 32:52.343
I'm sorry. I'm just thinking
about her family.

32:52.343 --> 32:54.080
Their daughter
finally going home.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.750
[Sam]
You never give up, Sue.

32:55.750 --> 32:58.188
No, it's not just me.

32:58.188 --> 33:00.325
There's a bunch of us
on the Internet.

33:00.325 --> 33:03.699
We're all connected.
These two found a tiny

33:03.699 --> 33:06.371
silver pin from a survivor.

33:06.371 --> 33:08.375
And it belongs to Carmen Perez.

- [Sam] You owe me nothing.

Uh, yeah, there's
an evidence bag over there.

- No, I'm not, I'm serious.

34:32.510 --> 34:34.548
It's genetic.
My father has it, too.

34:34.548 --> 34:35.717
Aww.

34:35.717 --> 34:37.687
Here. Take these,
then, sweetheart.

34:37.687 --> 34:39.223
- Oh, thanks, Sue.
- I'll call y'all tomorrow.

34:39.223 --> 34:41.461
All right, yep. Sounds good.

34:41.461 --> 34:43.365
Goodbye, little quiet girl.

34:43.365 --> 34:45.202

- Bye.

34:45.202 --> 34:48.609
- Take care, Sue. Bye.
- Bye, Sue.

34:48.609 --> 34:50.479
You know, we could ask her.

34:50.479 --> 34:52.349
No, Darby.

34:52.349 --> 34:55.254
She'd definitely let us
crash on her couch.

34:57.693 --> 35:00.533

Her family does not like

35:00.533 --> 35:02.504

35:02.504 --> 35:04.874

want us staying there.

- No?

37:40.385 --> 37:41.722

she said I'm only gonna
have one kid...

38:00.058 --> 38:01.762

- ...and it's gonna be
with someone

- No, of course not.

38:05.870 --> 38:07.574
That's why I'm having

40:04.073 --> 40:06.645

40:13.224 --> 40:16.163
Maybe this ring
belonged to his first.

40:16.163 --> 40:17.700
Yeah, maybe.

40:17.700 --> 40:21.007
I mean, it could
lead us to him, Bill.

40:21.007 --> 40:22.609
It could lead us
straight to him.

40:24.647 --> 40:26.083
How, though?

40:26.083 --> 40:28.722
Well...

40:28.722 --> 40:30.926
uh, serial killers
are hard to find, right,

40:30.926 --> 40:33.799
because their victims
are strangers.

40:33.799 --> 40:35.803
So no matter how far you trace

40:35.803 --> 40:39.109
the victim's web of
relationships, nothing connects.

40:41.147 --> 40:42.684
you get nothing.

40:45.021 --> 40:48.227
the first life
that a serial killer takes,

40:48.227 --> 40:51.601
it tends to be someone he knows.

40:51.601 --> 40:54.640
- So he gets the taste for it.
- Can we talk about
something else?

Uh... Is that okay?

48:38.601 --> 48:40.370
Is that morphine?

48:42.008 --> 48:43.477
[Sian]
Todd.

48:43.477 --> 48:46.349
Can you give me a hand here?
It's not coming off.

48:47.586 --> 48:50.324
Just press the button
and it should release.

48:50.324 --> 48:52.696
Wait. Wait, I-I don't
want morphine.

48:52.696 --> 48:55.668
It's just one milligram,
for the pain.

48:57.639 --> 48:58.674
It's all right.

49:00.512 --> 49:02.550
- [Sian] You see it?
It's not coming off.
- The light's coming on.

49:02.550 --> 49:05.287
[Eva]
It's gonna be okay. Now I'm
just gluing this laceration.

49:12.235 --> 49:15.208
What the fuck were you doing?

49:15.208 --> 49:17.212
It's not... Her-her helmet's
jammed or something.

49:17.212 --> 49:19.115
- It's not responding.
- [Sian] It won't release.

49:22.088 --> 49:24.326
[Andy]
You're in manual override?

49:24.326 --> 49:27.766
- [Sian] Of course.
- What does the readout say?

49:27.766 --> 49:30.238
[Sian]
"Helmet sealed."

49:30.238 --> 49:31.674
[Andy]
How much oxygen?

49:33.645 --> 49:35.982
Two minutes.

49:47.238 --> 49:49.342
[keyboard clicking]

49:52.081 --> 49:53.284
[Sian]
Is this a hack?

49:53.284 --> 49:54.520
[Andy]
You need to sit down.

49:54.520 --> 49:55.722
Conserve air.

49:58.427 --> 50:00.163
Down.

50:03.303 --> 50:05.207
- [grunts]
- [Marius] [whispering]
Sian's helmet won't come off.

50:05.207 --> 50:06.744
It's in manual. We can't get it.

50:06.744 --> 50:08.614
She only has three minutes
of oxygen left.

50:12.856 --> 50:14.225
[beeps]

50:15.260 --> 50:17.566
Can we thread oxygen
through the gap?

50:17.566 --> 50:21.373
There is no gap. It's sealed
for chemical attacks.

50:21.373 --> 50:23.578
- You could hit her skull.
- [Sian] I'll take my chances.

50:23.578 --> 50:26.082
- Hold still.
- [drill whirring]

50:32.529 --> 50:34.432
- [whirring stops]
- [grunts] Nothing doing.

50:34.432 --> 50:35.768
[Sian]
One minute.

50:39.475 --> 50:41.514
Okay. Lie back.

50:41.514 --> 50:43.116
Brace yourself.

50:47.258 --> 50:51.199
We need to do
an emergency tracheotomy.

50:51.199 --> 50:52.836
- Have you done one before?
- No.

50:52.836 --> 50:55.240
- Only in school.
- Quick.

50:59.683 --> 51:02.421
- You're gonna put her under?
- No. There's no time.

51:04.459 --> 51:06.196
Try to relax.

51:06.196 --> 51:08.133
[Eva]
Okay. Hold that, hold that.

51:08.935 --> 51:10.605
[Andy]
Do it.

51:10.605 --> 51:13.276
[Eva] I'm just trying to
avoid hitting her vocal cords.

51:14.345 --> 51:15.414
[Andy]
Do it.

51:15.414 --> 51:17.451
- [panting]
- Come on, Eva.

51:23.163 --> 51:25.200
[grunting]

51:32.314 --> 51:33.651
[wheezing gasp]

51:54.292 --> 51:56.329
[monitor beeping steadily]

52:14.600 --> 52:15.935
[Lee]
Hey.

52:17.873 --> 52:19.543
You feel okay?

52:19.543 --> 52:22.816
How you doing?

52:22.816 --> 52:24.553
Where's Sian?

52:24.553 --> 52:28.661
She's all right.
She's in her room recovering.

52:29.930 --> 52:33.236
I'm sorry I have to keep waking
you. It's for the concussion.

52:35.007 --> 52:37.411
I'm gonna let you
go back to sleep.

52:43.891 --> 52:46.597
[monitor beeping steadily]

52:46.597 --> 52:48.667
[exhales]

52:56.884 --> 52:59.222
[Darby]
Zoomer?

52:59.222 --> 53:02.629
[laughs softly]
Get off.

53:12.314 --> 53:14.519
How long have I been asleep?

53:41.874 --> 53:44.378
[sneezing]

53:47.484 --> 53:49.523
["Winter in F Minor"
by Vivaldi playing]

53:59.041 --> 54:00.778
What did you just do?

54:02.582 --> 54:04.787
I sneezed.

54:04.787 --> 54:07.492
It's called Autosomal Dominant

54:07.492 --> 54:10.397
Compelling Helioopthalmic Outburst.

54:10.397 --> 54:12.970
I sneeze from the light.

54:12.970 --> 54:15.876
âª âª

54:15.876 --> 54:18.547

55:52.301 --> 55:54.439
Not one of you is going back

55:54.439 --> 55:56.944
until I know
who has betrayed me.

55:58.881 --> 55:59.984
Did you find anything?

55:59.984 --> 56:01.820
No.

56:02.021 --> 56:03.891
I don't think you're telling
me the truth.

56:03.891 --> 56:06.597
Yeah? Why is that?

56:06.597 --> 56:08.433
Where were you when Bill died?

56:08.433 --> 56:09.770
What were you doing?

56:09.770 --> 56:11.106
I don't have to answer that.

56:11.106 --> 56:12.976
It's never good to keep secrets

56:12.976 --> 56:14.880
and I've kept so many of them.

56:14.880 --> 56:16.584
Careful, girl.

56:16.584 --> 56:19.590
I'm being set up.
This is sabotage.

56:19.590 --> 56:21.459
It would be a clever plot

56:21.459 --> 56:23.698
to lure some of your greatest competition

56:23.698 --> 56:26.570
then dispatch of them
one by one.

56:28.941 --> 56:31.747
I've been focusing on trying
to find the killer

56:31.747 --> 56:34.986
when I should be trying to
understand the victim.

56:35.655 --> 56:38.594
I feel like I'd have to die for
you to love me.

56:42.769 --> 56:45.975
What's waiting for you at the
top is unforgettable.
