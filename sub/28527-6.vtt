00:08.717 --> 00:12.095
[Blaine] <i>Let's just admit it,</i>
<i>we've all got a little monster in us.</i>

00:12.637 --> 00:14.305
[mob shouting]

00:14.389 --> 00:16.016
[man] He's a murderer!

00:17.058 --> 00:19.060
[indistinct chatter]

00:19.144 --> 00:20.812
[cheerful music playing]

00:32.323 --> 00:33.324
[Carol] Excuse me, hon.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.076
Excuse me.

00:35.827 --> 00:38.204
Sidecar. Give it some extra kick.

00:38.329 --> 00:39.664
You got proof of ID?

00:39.873 --> 00:40.707
Funny.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.626
Sense of humor. Unique fashion sense.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.128
Owner, or just work here?

00:45.503 --> 00:46.796
Kind of both.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.715
-It's complicated.
-You're employed.

00:49.549 --> 00:52.218
And yet, despite all that,
let me guess... single?

00:52.469 --> 00:54.846
-How can you tell?
-It's my job.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.932
I'm a matchmaker. Some of my handiwork.

01:00.477 --> 01:01.895
So, which way, boys or girls?

01:02.062 --> 01:02.896
What?

01:03.313 --> 01:04.856
[laughing] What... What...

01:05.732 --> 01:07.901
So, girls. Okay. Yes, I see.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.321
I think I have the perfect one for you.

01:11.780 --> 01:12.614
One what?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.282
The perfect girl for you.

01:16.159 --> 01:16.993
Excuse me.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.705
Mr. Eberhard.
This is my son's wedding reception, and--

01:20.830 --> 01:22.957
Yeah, just a second. Perfect for me?
How do you even know?

01:24.417 --> 01:26.169
Intuition. Experience.

01:26.461 --> 01:27.295
It's my job.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.756
-If you're interested.
-[Don E] So...

01:30.006 --> 01:31.716
So, what, I just call you, and--

01:32.342 --> 01:33.635
-Mr. Eberhard!
-What?

01:33.968 --> 01:39.307
It's my son's wedding reception,
and there are people picketing outside.

01:39.557 --> 01:41.601
The owner's had
some bad press recently, so...

01:41.684 --> 01:44.229
That Blaine DeBeers sounds like a monster.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.024
Is he a monster?

01:51.236 --> 01:52.070
[Blaine] <i>Am I a monster? </i>

01:52.529 --> 01:54.280
<i>Maybe I've crossed a few lines...</i>

01:54.656 --> 01:55.657
[man] Monster!

01:55.740 --> 01:57.951
[Blaine] <i>But does that make me a monster?</i>

01:58.118 --> 01:58.952
-[mob shouting]
-[man] You killer!

01:59.160 --> 02:00.161
[Major] Here's the situation.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.747
Shipments of brains
into Seattle have stopped.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.291
We have supplies for three days.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.545
I need you to tell me
the details of your operation,

02:08.628 --> 02:10.171
so we can get the brains moving again.

02:10.421 --> 02:12.799
You make these charges disappear
and get me out of here,

02:12.882 --> 02:14.884
I'll have brain operations
back up in a day.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.553
'Cause I can't take it.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.930
The break-room TV is just repeating

02:19.013 --> 02:21.599
the edited-for-television version
of <i>Snakes on a Plane.</i>

02:22.142 --> 02:23.059
You're toxic.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.271
If I let you out,
people will riot in the streets.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.773
Well, I guess we're all screwed,
monkey fighter.

02:30.358 --> 02:34.571
You see? Samuel L. Jackson
just doesn't work edited for TV.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.494
[Blaine] <i>Without monsters,</i>
<i>what would people even talk about?</i>

02:42.453 --> 02:43.830
<i>The case of Carol Barbera, </i>

02:44.372 --> 02:46.499
<i>the murdered matchmaker</i>
<i>these two are working on?</i>

02:47.333 --> 02:48.167
<i>Seen it.</i>

02:48.418 --> 02:49.252
<i>But, if you insist.</i>

02:49.919 --> 02:52.463
So, did Major fill you in
on the whole Blaine business?

02:52.547 --> 02:53.423
Good riddance, I say.

02:53.756 --> 02:55.842
Living the high life off
the cures he stole from us.

02:56.467 --> 02:57.844
I say, let him rot.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.181
What? Don't tell me you don't savor
the idea of Blaine DeBeers

03:02.265 --> 03:04.726
spending some well-earned time
in an unflattering jumpsuit.

03:04.809 --> 03:06.644
I can deal with Blaine
living the high life,

03:06.728 --> 03:08.521
as long as he kept the city
from coming apart.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.524
So, check it out.

03:11.983 --> 03:15.862
That red button found at the scene,
not hers.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.864
Not hers? Interesting.

03:19.490 --> 03:21.492
[Blaine] <i>No, it's not.</i>
<i>We all know the drill.</i>

03:21.910 --> 03:25.246
<i>You eat the brain,</i>
<i>find clues...blah-blah-blah, case closed.</i>

03:25.663 --> 03:27.040
<i>But this isn't her story.</i>

03:27.624 --> 03:28.833
<i>It's mine.</i>

03:31.920 --> 03:33.922
[opening theme music playing]

03:56.819 --> 03:59.864
So, what's it like being
the most hated man in Seattle?

04:00.156 --> 04:03.076
I don't know.
I haven't talked to A-Rod in a while.

04:04.285 --> 04:05.828
So, this is all a joke to you?

04:06.120 --> 04:07.205
Not a very funny one.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.207
Well, this is a waste of time.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.626
We'll have a warrant for his house
within 24 hours.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.086
-Then he'll talk.
-[Blaine] About what?

04:13.169 --> 04:14.921
My Greene and Greene coffee table?

04:15.296 --> 04:16.631
Or my Warhol Polaroids?

04:16.714 --> 04:18.925
How about the mask
your journalist friend took pictures of?

04:20.009 --> 04:21.594
It's the same one I saw in a vision.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.388
I know you killed the mayor.

04:23.513 --> 04:24.555
Aren't you a little...

04:25.556 --> 04:27.684
fertilized to be having visions?

04:30.061 --> 04:31.562
Shut up. Don't speak.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.606
You know the drill,
lawyer's here, you're out.

04:33.690 --> 04:34.732
[S. Cavanaugh scoffs]

04:36.192 --> 04:37.360
Great talk, gang.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.362
We all learned something.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.948
Okay. Fun fact.

04:42.323 --> 04:44.701
No one in the history
of the criminal justice system

04:44.784 --> 04:48.037
has ever gotten off
as a result of a witticism or zinger.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.914
Don't speak.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.624
I've reviewed your case.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.377
And from a legal angle,

04:55.128 --> 04:56.004
I've seen worse.

04:57.171 --> 04:59.132
From a PR angle, I haven't.

05:00.049 --> 05:03.219
I'm gonna need to do some fancy filing
to see if I can swing bail.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.559
In the meantime, what do you do?

05:10.560 --> 05:11.769
-Speak?
-Don't speak.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.814
I do have to get a message
to an associate, though.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.399
Oh. Well, let me check.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.067
[Blaine] I'm pretty sure it's legal.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.320
[Brandt] No, I meant your retainer.
Did the check clear?

05:21.988 --> 05:23.072
Yeah, you can tell me.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.575
[Blaine clears throat]

05:33.708 --> 05:36.544
"Three hundred and sixty-five degrees."
That's the message?

05:37.503 --> 05:38.588
You sure he's gonna get it?

05:38.796 --> 05:39.839
Oh, yeah.

05:40.339 --> 05:41.966
My guy is as sharp as a tack.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.217
[groans]

05:43.301 --> 05:45.845
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about, I just work here.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.388
You're Blaine's right-hand man.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.224
I have a hard time believing
you don't know how his system works.

05:51.059 --> 05:54.020
I just do what he says.
It's brain's Blaines, man.

05:55.229 --> 05:56.606
Or... You know what I mean.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.692
Look, I'd love to help, but...

06:01.027 --> 06:02.528
Okay, look... [clears throat]

06:03.112 --> 06:06.240
I'm gonna leave this contract for you.
Same deal we had with Blaine.

06:06.449 --> 06:09.577
It's a good deal.
And a chance to step up, be a hero.

06:10.411 --> 06:13.081
Well, I'll have to ask Blaine,
because it's Blaine's...

06:13.748 --> 06:16.334
Brains? Yeah, got it.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.379
Gentlemen.

06:21.297 --> 06:22.381
Let's make a deal.

06:23.716 --> 06:24.801
Stacey Boss.

06:29.847 --> 06:30.807
Stacey Boss.

06:31.015 --> 06:31.933
Thought you were dead.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.935
[laughs] I was close.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.770
You have no idea how hot

06:35.853 --> 06:38.481
a Bangladeshi summer is
in a three-piece suit.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.108
You've been hiding in Bangladesh?

06:40.316 --> 06:41.526
"Hiding"?

06:41.943 --> 06:43.027
Working.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.737
Bangladesh, Sudan, Ukraine.

06:45.196 --> 06:47.782
Anywhere there's brains, I've been.
That's how it works.

06:47.990 --> 06:51.869
I procure,
Don E distributes, Blaine does jack.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.540
I'd be willing to solve
your little problem, right here and now.

06:55.957 --> 06:56.833
We cut Blaine out.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.127
Don E and I handle the brains ourselves.

07:00.002 --> 07:01.921
Everybody's happy, except Blaine.

07:03.339 --> 07:04.298
The catch being?

07:04.382 --> 07:07.802
A slight cost adjustment.
Say, double what you're paying Blaine?

07:07.969 --> 07:10.179
We don't have the budget.
I can't agree to that.

07:10.513 --> 07:14.058
I get it. Budgets are stubborn things,
but let me just say this.

07:14.183 --> 07:17.019
When zombies start tearing humans
limb from limb,

07:17.145 --> 07:19.230
my price is not likely to have come down.

07:21.983 --> 07:22.984
Taken under advisement.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.159
So, what'd you think?

07:31.576 --> 07:33.786
I think I wish you'd told me
about all this in advance.

07:33.995 --> 07:37.290
Sorry, but the pitch demanded
a dramatic entrance.

07:37.957 --> 07:38.791
Are you in?

07:40.084 --> 07:42.211
I don't know, cutting Blaine out...

07:42.628 --> 07:44.922
You do all the work and reap no reward.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.592
If the roles were reversed,
would Blaine be as loyal to you?

07:51.387 --> 07:52.972
But I don't know if Major's bluffing.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.348
I mean, Blaine had a good deal.

07:54.807 --> 07:57.018
<i>-If they don't have budget--</i>
-[Mr. Boss]<i> You play poker, Don E?</i>

07:57.268 --> 07:59.353
-[Don E] <i>Not really.</i>
-[Mr. Boss] <i>We got a winning hand.</i>

07:59.812 --> 08:01.939
<i>When you've got a winning hand,</i>
<i>you don't fold.</i>

08:02.023 --> 08:03.816
[crowd shouting]

08:11.157 --> 08:13.784
No! No, we're not gonna take it anymore!

08:13.951 --> 08:15.620
We're outraged!

08:17.121 --> 08:18.748
Fun crowd outside.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.167
Next time, use the back entrance.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.419
There shouldn't be a next time.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.672
I'm here on behalf of my client,
Blaine DeBeers.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.799
Tanner, where have you been?
Where's the booze?

08:28.883 --> 08:32.887
I can't run a bar with just vermouth
and this melon crap.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.055
He wouldn't let me take it.

08:34.138 --> 08:35.389
He says his payment didn't go through.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.934
What?
Why didn't you just use the business card?

08:38.017 --> 08:39.352
I tried. None of them worked.

08:39.602 --> 08:40.895
Get on the phone, call the bank--

08:40.978 --> 08:42.897
Don't bother. I've seen this before.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.857
They've frozen Blaine's assets.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.192
So, let me just give you this.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.445
"Three hundred and sixty-five degrees."

08:51.447 --> 08:52.281
What?

08:53.199 --> 08:54.242
Three hundred and sixty-five degrees.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.868
I hope it means something to you,

08:55.952 --> 08:57.036
because he just used up his retainer.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.621
Oh!

08:58.913 --> 08:59.997
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah?

09:00.248 --> 09:01.207
Okay, I got it.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.458
-Got it?
-[Don E] Yeah.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.793
[Clive] Don E.

09:05.336 --> 09:09.298
We need to ask you some questions
about the death of a Mrs. Carol Barbera.

09:09.423 --> 09:11.759
Hey, free advice. Don't speak.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.179
Murdered. The matchmaker,
she was murdered.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.264
Can you believe it?

09:16.430 --> 09:19.350
She's trying to make people happy,
ends up thrown off a balcony.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.102
[Clive] Did you meet Mrs. Barbera?

09:21.519 --> 09:22.645
I poured her a drink.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.897
She told me that she had my perfect match.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.023
[gasps] You're in her brain!

09:26.524 --> 09:27.942
Please tell me you remember the name.

09:28.025 --> 09:30.194
When she told me, I dropped the glass.

09:32.446 --> 09:33.406
Come on, have a vision.

09:36.117 --> 09:36.951
Nothing?

09:37.034 --> 09:37.868
Come on!

09:38.244 --> 09:40.204
Was there anything else
you noticed that night?

09:44.959 --> 09:46.794
She did have an argument with Candy.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.297
At one point. She's in the back.

09:51.799 --> 09:53.050
I'd knock first.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.221
I understand, General. But...

09:58.431 --> 10:01.183
the situation here is truly dire.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.352
<i>I can't state it any more bluntly.</i>

10:04.478 --> 10:06.772
<i>We'll be out of brains in 48 hours.</i>

10:07.189 --> 10:09.650
<i>After that,</i>
<i>zombies might turn on the living. </i>

10:09.984 --> 10:11.569
<i>Some might try to scale the wall.</i>

10:12.528 --> 10:14.614
<i>I know that you think this is our problem,</i>

10:15.489 --> 10:17.742
<i>but it could end up</i>
<i>being all of our problem.</i>

10:17.867 --> 10:19.535
Thank you, uh, Major.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.121
We'll discuss it
and get back to you later.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.706
<i>Or sooner, if you can.</i>

10:24.832 --> 10:27.918
I don't see why they haven't just
taken care of these things already.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.880
Maybe 'cause it's not that easy
to go next door and murder your neighbor.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.758
And we're talking about
the lives of thousands of innocent humans.

10:33.883 --> 10:34.717
Hostages.

10:34.925 --> 10:38.262
We do still have brain stockpiled
from before we cut 'em off.

10:39.263 --> 10:42.767
General Mills,
that sounds surprisingly temperate.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.853
I believe "nuke 'em all"
was your previous position.

10:46.020 --> 10:49.231
It's just...
I figure, it could buy us some time.

10:49.523 --> 10:52.360
I mean, I hear there's progress
on the CDC end.

10:52.860 --> 10:56.447
All right, so, Glenn is now willing
to buy some time.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.450
All right, moving on. Next item.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.209
I have good news and bad news.

11:08.584 --> 11:11.003
Ah, good news. I could use some good news.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.338
I'll start with the bad news.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.839
Your assets are frozen.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.800
You're unable to pay my fee.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.635
Come on, man.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.553
You know I'm good for it.

11:19.637 --> 11:20.513
I don't.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.474
The good news is,
I have an in with your judge, so,

11:23.808 --> 11:26.143
if I play ball and I go the extra mile,

11:26.268 --> 11:27.978
I think I can get you off
this whole thing.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.981
If you're able to pay my retainer.

11:31.607 --> 11:32.733
Okay.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.819
I guess I gotta make some calls.

11:34.902 --> 11:35.903
You made your call.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.364
But I can call whomever you'd like.

11:40.699 --> 11:43.577
Money? What money? I don't have any money.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.037
[on speaker] <i>Do you know how much I make?</i>

11:45.371 --> 11:46.997
Tell him I do know,

11:47.289 --> 11:50.126
I was obviously talking about
the club account rainy day fund.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.752
He means the rainy day fund.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.462
Yeah, it's on fumes.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.090
[on speaker] <i>All right?</i>
<i>We don't have any customers.</i>

11:57.299 --> 11:59.718
Our vendors are demanding cash upfront.

12:00.386 --> 12:04.265
Tell him there's a red bag behind
the panel under the Hefeweizen tap.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.517
There's a bag under the Hefeweizen tap.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.227
Should be 50 grand in there.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.646
My client says there's 50 grand in there.

12:15.151 --> 12:15.985
There's 40 grand.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.529
[mouthing]

12:20.739 --> 12:21.574
Don E...

12:22.908 --> 12:24.869
Could you loan me $10,000?

12:25.327 --> 12:27.163
-He wants you to loan him--
-$10,000?

12:27.288 --> 12:29.623
Blaine, man,
I'm not exactly rolling in dough.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.544
Damn it, Don E! Just give me the money.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.297
He just wants you to get him the money.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.590
[sighs]

12:41.218 --> 12:42.553
[Don E] <i>Okay, fine. I'll get it.</i>

12:43.846 --> 12:45.848
Okay. What the hell is this?

12:48.184 --> 12:49.018
Oh, no.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.312
My beautiful, beautiful home.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.898
So, we'll just be adding
"destroying evidence" to the charges?

12:54.106 --> 12:55.274
And why is that?

12:55.691 --> 12:57.359
I'm the most hated man in Seattle.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.279
Why wouldn't my house get torched?

13:07.036 --> 13:10.956
You tweeted "Seattle has two days
until brain supplies run out."

13:11.040 --> 13:12.917
How do you back up your claim?

13:14.168 --> 13:18.422
The blue-collar workers in that plant
are my friends and neighbors.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.842
<i>And they told me, "No more brains."</i>

13:22.343 --> 13:25.596
<i>Officials at the plant</i>
<i>did not respond for comment.</i>

13:26.514 --> 13:27.348
<i>Back to you.</i>

13:28.140 --> 13:30.976
So, Commander, the joint chiefs called
while you were out.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.311
Finally.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.063
Alan, let's call back the joint chiefs.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.482
Actually, sir, they, uh, left a message.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.568
Basically, since it's the official
position of the US government that...

13:40.444 --> 13:42.947
Fillmore Graves is a terrorist operation,

13:43.197 --> 13:44.823
-they do not--
-So, no?

13:45.199 --> 13:46.408
[Hobbs] Yes. No.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.120
[TV reporter]
<i>Many left are wondering if...</i>

13:50.204 --> 13:51.038
Oh, and, uh...

13:51.956 --> 13:54.416
Looks like Blaine DeBeers made bail.

13:58.837 --> 14:02.299
The house's in my ex-stepdad's name,
so no one'll trace you here.

14:02.633 --> 14:03.842
You can hang as long as you want.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.679
Which will be zero minutes.

14:07.555 --> 14:08.806
This makes me miss jail.

14:09.306 --> 14:12.017
Oh, come on, it's not that bad.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.519
It's private.

14:14.061 --> 14:16.063
You got the TV.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.148
The couch.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.444
I spent some pretty good times down here.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.779
I'm sure you did.

14:24.613 --> 14:25.739
Right where you are now,

14:26.073 --> 14:28.367
me and Pam Hagler
watched the <i>One Tree Hill</i> premiere.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.079
-And I lost my--
-[Blaine] If you continue,

14:32.371 --> 14:34.832
the scream I utter
will shatter the universe.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.586
Okay, fine.
I'm going to The Scratching Post.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.719
I am on a yacht to Ibiza.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.806
Blake Lively is hitching a ride.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.099
[echoing laughter]

14:52.182 --> 14:54.685
We're sharing a nice crisp Grüner.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.312
[loud thud]

14:58.564 --> 15:00.316
You must be Don's friend.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.071
-[washing machine whirring]
-[sighs]

15:12.286 --> 15:14.830
All right, so, give her the rundown.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.790
And just keep in mind,
if she doesn't pass,

15:17.374 --> 15:19.084
your boyfriend washes up in the lake.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.045
Okay.

15:22.129 --> 15:25.507
So, they're toughest
with stuff they can double check.

15:25.674 --> 15:26.800
Names. Dates.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.095
Addresses. Stuff like that.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.723
-You'll need to have that down pat.
-It's down.

15:33.557 --> 15:34.850
That it? Just questions?

15:35.100 --> 15:38.228
If you pass the interview,
they'll say you're in,

15:38.312 --> 15:39.605
then do a group toast.

15:40.189 --> 15:43.150
But the shot they give you
is laced with ghost pepper.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.403
You'll need to react
to prove you're human.

15:49.031 --> 15:49.865
That it?

15:50.366 --> 15:51.575
Yeah. That's it.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.038
I appreciate the warning,
Commander Lillywhite,

15:56.121 --> 15:58.415
but I really don't need
protective custody.

15:59.500 --> 16:03.212
Yes, I'm aware what kind of man Blaine is.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.381
Yeah. I'll be fine, thank you. Bye-bye.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.174
[door slams]

16:09.301 --> 16:10.636
My ears were burning right up.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.056
[laughs] What do you want?

16:15.933 --> 16:17.184
What do I want?

16:17.851 --> 16:19.853
You always did cut right to the chase,
didn't you?

16:20.688 --> 16:21.647
Okay.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.357
I wanna scare you.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.028
Yeah, I've killed people,
your story was correct.

16:28.445 --> 16:29.989
Hell, I'm probably gonna kill you, too.

16:30.698 --> 16:31.532
Not now...

16:32.199 --> 16:33.117
but soon.

16:34.118 --> 16:39.081
I just wanted you to know, so you could
spend whatever time you do have left

16:39.373 --> 16:42.459
in fear, knowing it's coming.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.213
You really pissed me off.

16:47.423 --> 16:49.258
'Cause I showed people who you really are.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.301
Yeah, it was gonna happen.

16:52.094 --> 16:55.514
Did you really think this whole
charming-rascal act would work forever?

16:56.515 --> 16:57.349
It worked on you.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.309
It worked on me? No.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.520
I worked on you, dummy.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.856
[laughs]

17:03.939 --> 17:06.358
You sad daddy's boys are all the same.

17:06.984 --> 17:07.943
You're so gullible.

17:08.318 --> 17:09.862
-You don't know me.
-[woman] Sure I do.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.282
You're another two-bit homicidal thug

17:13.365 --> 17:14.825
who thinks he's unique

17:14.908 --> 17:17.369
because, deep down,
you're special and you're different,

17:17.453 --> 17:19.038
and you deserve admiration.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.832
Like, from Peyton Charles.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.001
The great love of your life.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.170
You know what she called you?

17:26.503 --> 17:27.755
Her greatest embarrassment.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.506
[laughs]

17:29.590 --> 17:31.717
You are a goon, Blaine. That's all.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.886
Just an average, run-of-the-mill--

17:44.938 --> 17:46.523
I can see the headline now.

17:46.857 --> 17:48.692
"Child-killer shot dead."

17:49.485 --> 17:51.070
They would throw me a parade.

17:57.951 --> 17:59.328
You can show yourself out.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.123
[keyboard clacking]

18:07.419 --> 18:08.629
Okay, hold it right there.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.799
Really gotta work on that, Don E.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.801
You were holding a gun right at me
and I wasn't scared at all.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.219
What're you doing here?

18:16.053 --> 18:18.680
Trying to solve my liquidity crisis.

18:19.807 --> 18:22.643
I need that list of bidders
from our zombie-cure auction,

18:22.726 --> 18:24.186
as we still got a few cures left.

18:25.395 --> 18:27.272
Okay, now we're talking.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.858
By the way, have you seen
Lieutenant Bozzio lately?

18:30.526 --> 18:32.736
Yeah, I do my best to steer clear,
she scares me a little.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.155
Yeah, well, she's pregnant.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.282
-Did you know that?
-How does a zombie end up pregnant?

18:37.533 --> 18:40.285
I assume in the normal way,
just not as a zombie.

18:40.494 --> 18:44.039
I read this article about this kid
who died of some rare brain disease,

18:44.123 --> 18:48.085
which made her brain a zombie cure,
and it got me thinking that...

18:48.794 --> 18:51.130
Whoa! Found it. Okay.

18:51.797 --> 18:56.301
We need to contact all the runner-up bids
and we should be flush again by lunch.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.679
-[laughing]
-Whew!

18:59.346 --> 19:00.264
You get the stuff from the safe?

19:01.014 --> 19:01.849
Tanner took care of it.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.725
Tanner! Bring in the stuff from the house.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.477
Ah, you sent Tanner?

19:06.186 --> 19:08.856
I was being tailed, it wasn't safe.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.732
[whispering] Tanner is capable.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.234
Here it is.

19:12.484 --> 19:15.404
Cleaned out the safe just like you said.
Cash, IDs.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.321
Just give me the bag.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.782
Sorry if some of the pages
are wrinkled and stuff.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.124
[inhales sharply and sighs]

19:28.876 --> 19:30.502
Where are my cures, Tanner?

19:32.504 --> 19:34.882
Four syringes, in a Ziploc bag.

19:35.549 --> 19:39.761
Oh. So, I'm going back over the bridge,
cops pulled me over.

19:39.928 --> 19:42.014
I got two strikes,
I can't get caught with drugs.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.265
So, I ditched 'em.

19:43.765 --> 19:45.934
You... You "ditched" them?

19:46.185 --> 19:47.686
I tossed them off the bridge.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.314
Don't worry, they won't find 'em.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.440
[sighs]

19:52.399 --> 19:53.442
[breathing heavily]

19:58.322 --> 19:59.448
[yells]

20:01.575 --> 20:03.493
Strike three, monkey fighter.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.497
[Blaine panting]

20:11.251 --> 20:13.587
You were supposed to handle this.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.839
So, you take care of that.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.300
You did this, Don E!

20:20.177 --> 20:21.178
You did.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.735
Of all the things I've missed
about the First World,

20:37.903 --> 20:39.905
high-quality bourbon isn't the least.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.116
We're still considered the First World?

20:43.492 --> 20:45.035
[laughing]

20:45.118 --> 20:46.453
You raise a good point.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.538
But, hey,
at least our hand remains strong.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.749
With that crazy fish lady
stirring the pot,

20:50.999 --> 20:53.835
it's just a matter of time
before Fillmore Graves folds.

20:54.711 --> 20:56.630
-So, I wanted--
-Get your feet off my desk.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.224
You gonna tell me
whose blood that is on your shirt?

21:08.225 --> 21:09.685
Just a friend.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.567
Oh, man, what I wouldn't give
to go back to the old days.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.111
Yeah.

21:19.194 --> 21:20.737
When cops were cheap

21:20.821 --> 21:22.447
and the racketeerin' was easy.

21:22.823 --> 21:25.951
And the Utopium wasn't cut down
to basically pancake mix.

21:26.326 --> 21:27.452
[laughs]

21:27.536 --> 21:29.162
The stuff Beanpole Bob made?

21:29.246 --> 21:30.831
[speaking Italian]

21:30.998 --> 21:32.791
The Da Vinci of the drug trade.

21:32.874 --> 21:35.752
[laughing] Beanpole Bob.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.172
I forgot about that guy.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.550
Whatever happened to that weirdo?

21:41.633 --> 21:43.552
Oh, the usual story.

21:43.635 --> 21:45.095
Got into his own supply,

21:45.178 --> 21:46.346
fried his brain.

21:51.351 --> 21:52.686
Hey, kid.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.065
I respect your loyalty to Blaine,

21:57.149 --> 21:59.693
but there is serious money
on the table here

21:59.776 --> 22:01.111
-and if we--
-Screw Blaine.

22:04.114 --> 22:05.157
I'm in.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.588
U-dub Law.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.214
So, where did you live then?

22:21.298 --> 22:23.050
Studio in Eastlake, off Edgar.

22:23.133 --> 22:26.178
Stayed when I started as
a public defender, 'cause I made zilch.

22:26.261 --> 22:28.805
You do realize you'd be
putting your life at risk

22:28.889 --> 22:31.266
to break the law if you joined our cause.

22:31.349 --> 22:32.184
I get that.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.186
I mean, I love the law,

22:34.269 --> 22:37.189
but I just wanted to make
a real difference in something bigger.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.149
Graham says you met in high school?

22:39.399 --> 22:41.860
Uh, no. No, we met at his school.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.278
I volunteer there.

22:43.570 --> 22:44.654
I love kids. [laughs]

22:48.033 --> 22:49.826
You want kids of your own someday?

22:50.869 --> 22:53.163
Uh, yeah. I guess, yeah. Someday.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.457
[chuckles] I sensed that.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.751
Anyone in your life now?

22:58.460 --> 23:01.379
[Riley] Uh, no, not at the moment.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.757
Because you're "focused" on your career?

23:03.840 --> 23:06.218
No, that's just what you tell people

23:06.301 --> 23:07.844
because you don't want to settle.

23:07.969 --> 23:09.387
You have standards.

23:09.596 --> 23:12.349
Don't worry, we will help you find
someone who meets them.

23:12.432 --> 23:15.060
Should we maybe focus less
on her love life and more on,

23:15.185 --> 23:17.771
say, her qualifications as a coyote?

23:17.854 --> 23:18.939
Are they exclusive?

23:19.064 --> 23:22.275
Little-known fact,
urban coyotes mate for life.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.569
So might this guy, thanks to me.

23:26.196 --> 23:28.156
Oh, you are not taking credit
for me and Peyton.

23:28.323 --> 23:30.075
You tried to keep us apart.

23:30.158 --> 23:32.702
So that you'd have to fight
to be together.

23:33.495 --> 23:34.871
All part of my plan. [blows raspberry]

23:34.955 --> 23:36.748
So, um...

23:37.958 --> 23:39.167
Is the interview over?

23:40.752 --> 23:42.420
Did she pass or what?

23:48.718 --> 23:50.929
-With flying colors.
-[chuckles]

23:51.012 --> 23:52.556
Let's make it official.

23:52.681 --> 23:55.725
We call this a "coyote baptism."

23:55.809 --> 23:57.144
Oh, my.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.361
Hey, what's this hospitality?

24:07.237 --> 24:09.030
The doctor needs his medicine, too, yeah?

24:09.322 --> 24:10.907
We only have four glasses, so...

24:13.577 --> 24:17.581
I think it's best you steer clear
of the hard stuff, Doctor.

24:17.664 --> 24:18.665
Thanks, Mum,

24:18.748 --> 24:21.334
but I can handle the hard stuff
better than you Yankee lot.

24:21.418 --> 24:22.711
[laughs]

24:23.753 --> 24:25.005
If you say so.

24:25.589 --> 24:26.715
To Riley!

24:34.848 --> 24:36.933
[wheezes and coughs]

24:37.017 --> 24:39.019
And now you've passed.
Just had to be sure.

24:42.439 --> 24:43.690
[breath trembling]

24:43.773 --> 24:44.816
Help.

24:46.776 --> 24:50.864

Things'll calm down once
we get the brains flowing again.

25:26.733 --> 25:28.318
[clears throat] Yeah, speaking of.

Transcript from our bug
in The Scratching Post.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.155
Boss and Don E

25:32.239 --> 25:34.324
have cut DeBeers out of the operation.

25:34.407 --> 25:36.493
[TV reporter]
<i>Has Seattle finally reached the end</i>

25:36.576 --> 25:39.329
<i>of its tenuous zombie-human peace?</i>

25:41.331 --> 25:42.457
[sighs]

25:44.668 --> 25:45.877
Hello, kiddo.

25:49.673 --> 25:50.840
Uncle Stacey!

25:51.925 --> 25:54.094
-I didn't know you were in town.
-Oh.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.305
And I come bearing gifts.

25:57.889 --> 26:00.016
The brain of Tibetan monk,

26:00.100 --> 26:02.018
said to have reached nirvana.

26:02.102 --> 26:04.771
-[gasps]
-But a humble token of my gratitude

26:04.854 --> 26:06.147
for clearing Blaine off the board.

26:06.231 --> 26:09.192
Please, it was my pleasure
to eviscerate the douchebag.

26:09.734 --> 26:10.735
Is the plan going okay?

26:11.069 --> 26:13.238
Flawlessly.
Fillmore Graves is about to fold.

26:13.321 --> 26:15.573
I sign a contract, resume the brain-flow,

26:15.657 --> 26:17.909
-all that's left is us counting our money.
-[laughs]

26:18.994 --> 26:20.078
[rings bell]

26:20.161 --> 26:21.496
Hi, can I help...

26:21.746 --> 26:23.415
-You?
-Hi.

26:23.873 --> 26:25.208
Cute shirt.

26:25.292 --> 26:26.835
Does it say on the back what zombies get,

26:26.918 --> 26:28.378
or is it the same "dead fish" idea?

26:28.461 --> 26:29.879
We don't serve your kind here.

26:30.588 --> 26:33.133
Oh. But if I have to
shut you down for discrimination,

26:33.216 --> 26:35.927
you won't get to do any more
of those fun little TV interviews.

26:45.687 --> 26:46.730
$9.50.

26:48.481 --> 26:49.858
Excellent service.

26:49.941 --> 26:51.818
Ah. Keep the change.

26:54.738 --> 26:57.449
All good, boys,
they do serve zombies here.

26:57.657 --> 26:58.867
Anyone hungry?

27:04.039 --> 27:05.040
Mmm.

27:11.379 --> 27:14.591
You think you and your jackbooted thugs
can obstruct my business?

27:15.008 --> 27:17.886
You brain-eating, undead abominations--

27:17.969 --> 27:19.095
Jeez, Mom.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.014
Just chill out.

27:21.890 --> 27:25.185
You gave up the right to call me that
when you became one of them.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.899
You've been holding out on me, Murphy.

27:32.359 --> 27:33.943
Dolly Durkins is your mother?

27:34.402 --> 27:35.612
Not anymore, I guess.

27:36.738 --> 27:39.032
-Wow.
-If I may speak freely, sir...

27:39.824 --> 27:41.326
don't underestimate her.

27:41.576 --> 27:43.453
She really hates zombies.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.883
Are you mad?

27:57.592 --> 27:59.803
Major's got a bit much
on his plate for you to set him up

27:59.886 --> 28:01.846
on a blind date,
and you barely know Riley.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.390
I know she's perfect for him.

28:03.473 --> 28:06.434
Smart, compassionate,
wants to make the world better.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.269
Loves children, and,

28:08.353 --> 28:10.772
let's be honest,
she not too tough on the eyes.

28:11.731 --> 28:13.525
-She does sound perfect.
-[chuckles]

28:13.608 --> 28:15.860
If only there were
a zombie version of her.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.613
Ugh, I know. But let's not forget,

28:18.738 --> 28:20.448
Major has a proven willingness

28:20.573 --> 28:22.283
to go without sex for love.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.160
I have a willingness to do what?

28:24.244 --> 28:25.245
Oh, Major.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.580
Do you want to meet a new friend of mine?
She's a lawyer.

28:27.914 --> 28:29.249
-Matchmaker brain?
-[Ravi] Yep.

28:29.332 --> 28:31.543
Nailed it. This is addressed to you.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.002
-Ooh.
-I have a picture of her.

28:33.086 --> 28:34.963
Liv, I appreciate the thought,

28:35.088 --> 28:37.298
but unless this girl can get
a massive quantity of brains

28:37.382 --> 28:39.259
into the city overnight,
I think I'll pass.

28:39.342 --> 28:41.803
I'd put a ring on it,
if she had some tainted Utopium.

28:41.886 --> 28:42.887
Peyton would understand.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.014
That reminds me,
does the name "Beanpole Bob"

28:45.098 --> 28:46.057
mean anything to you?

28:47.392 --> 28:48.351
No, why?

28:48.435 --> 28:50.061
Name came up in an intel file.

28:50.186 --> 28:52.313
The Da Vinci of Utopium, apparently.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.899
Uh, I can ask Clive.

28:54.983 --> 28:57.944
See if he knows a Beanpole
from his Vice days.

28:59.237 --> 29:00.280
[object clattering]

29:03.074 --> 29:04.451
[Major] Night-vision goggles?

29:06.953 --> 29:08.455
Because the CDC couldn't find

29:08.538 --> 29:10.832
any trace of tainted Utopium
in the vial I sent,

29:11.124 --> 29:12.584
I had the idea

29:12.667 --> 29:15.044
to sneak into Blaine's mansion
and steal back my cure,

29:15.128 --> 29:17.338
with the assistance of a cat-burglar brain

29:17.464 --> 29:19.132
and a pair of...

29:19.549 --> 29:21.050
Night-vision goggles.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.887
You know I command
a paramilitary force, right?

29:24.012 --> 29:25.555
I could have gotten you those for free.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.058
They're only 800 bucks.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.271
And with UFreightEze Select membership,

29:33.354 --> 29:36.858
you can get literally anything
delivered to your doorstep

29:37.192 --> 29:38.735
-in under 24 hours.
-[laughs]

29:46.326 --> 29:48.870
I want to help this city
in any way I can, Mr. Lillywhite,

29:48.953 --> 29:50.997
but this sounds like it's beyond even me.

29:51.122 --> 29:53.166
It might sound like it, Mr. Griss, but...

29:53.833 --> 29:55.877
See, we've disassociated
with Blaine DeBeers,

29:56.002 --> 29:59.047
and our alternate
brain supplier is too difficult.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.174
I get it. You need a supplier.

30:01.257 --> 30:02.926
But here's the problem as I see it.

30:03.134 --> 30:05.220
I have no clue
how to get thousands of brains.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.764
We'll get you a TV in a day,

30:07.847 --> 30:10.225
but our deliveries have
the advantage of being legal.

30:11.559 --> 30:14.187
I'm not a smuggler.
I wouldn't know where to begin.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.940
What if I told you, none of that mattered?

30:23.738 --> 30:24.572
[door closes]

30:27.325 --> 30:29.536
Whoo! This place is deader than we are.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.079
Can I give the girls the night off?

30:31.746 --> 30:34.707
See, that's the problem with
your generation, there's no work ethic.

30:34.791 --> 30:36.417
How old are you, exactly?

30:36.501 --> 30:38.753
Old enough to know
there's always a market in vice.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.631
We just need a fresh start.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.550
We need a makeover.

30:46.594 --> 30:48.847
You know what my idea
for a zombie brothel name would be?

30:48.972 --> 30:50.056
Hmm?

30:50.139 --> 30:51.224
Coldcocks.

30:52.475 --> 30:53.935
Why, because of all the fights?

30:54.018 --> 30:55.186
-[door slams]
-[mouthing] What?

30:56.020 --> 30:59.482
Oh, great. Look, I told you what I know,

30:59.566 --> 31:02.777
and if you're not here to tell me
my dream girl's name, then who cares?

31:02.861 --> 31:05.154
Actually, we need to talk to her.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.991
-Um, yeah.
-[Don E] What about me?

31:11.452 --> 31:12.537
Ha! [stammering]

31:12.620 --> 31:14.163
-There you go.
-[exhales sharply]

31:14.873 --> 31:16.791
-What'd you see?
-It was the skull.

31:17.667 --> 31:20.086
I saw a tattoo.
A small, tasteful skull, right here.

31:20.169 --> 31:21.212
Tattoos. I love tattoos.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.089
Wait, what about a name?
Did you see her name?

31:24.007 --> 31:25.967
That's it. Now...

31:33.975 --> 31:35.310
She's got a tattoo.

31:36.477 --> 31:38.688
[Clive] You recognize this coat,
Mrs. Schwartz?

31:38.771 --> 31:39.647
No, I don't.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.775
Caring Light has cameras
at their drop-off centers.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.736
We have you on tape dropping it off.

31:44.819 --> 31:47.947
Look, I told you, I was
at the movies with Mavis Jannings,

31:48.031 --> 31:49.866
who left ten minutes into the show

31:49.949 --> 31:51.492
to meet her lover, Bernard Salkin.

31:51.951 --> 31:53.161
Mutual alibis.

31:53.244 --> 31:55.997
Mrs. Schwartz, did you kill Carol Barbera?

31:58.750 --> 32:01.544
She set up my son with a zombie!

32:01.628 --> 32:02.545
Hold that thought.

32:02.629 --> 32:03.713
[Mrs. Schwartz sobbing]

32:04.589 --> 32:07.133
-[breathing heavily]
-Hey, you okay?

32:07.216 --> 32:08.593
[Dale] Yeah, just...

32:09.177 --> 32:10.178
You know,

32:10.762 --> 32:12.513
carrying a human being

32:12.597 --> 32:15.558
and all of its associated
gestation materials inside me.

32:16.267 --> 32:19.520
Sometimes, it's a bit uncomfortable.

32:20.355 --> 32:23.274
-But it's not a big deal.
-Woman, please. I got you.

32:23.858 --> 32:24.943
Let me take you home.

32:25.026 --> 32:27.862
Maybe, we stop off
at the OB on the way, just to check?

32:27.946 --> 32:29.113
Man,

32:29.197 --> 32:31.074
thank you, but I'm fine,

32:31.157 --> 32:32.408
-and--
-Hey.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.953
-I said I got you.
-I heard.

32:36.120 --> 32:39.540
Sounded kind of dorky both times,
if we're being honest.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.586
-I got you.
-I...

32:43.795 --> 32:45.505
stand corrected.

32:46.673 --> 32:47.674
Extremely dorky.

32:47.757 --> 32:49.092
[laughs]

32:54.514 --> 32:56.307
You wanna hear the rest, or...

32:56.557 --> 32:57.684
Oh...

32:59.060 --> 33:00.895
Go ahead, write it down.

33:05.900 --> 33:09.278
It's been three days,
they got to be out of brains by now.

33:09.362 --> 33:11.114
When is Major gonna throw his hand in?

33:11.197 --> 33:12.490
Patience, m'boy.

33:12.865 --> 33:14.784
-Any minute now.
-[Candy] Hey!

33:15.660 --> 33:16.911
Have you guys seen these billboards?

33:17.662 --> 33:19.497
Candy, men are talking business.

33:19.580 --> 33:21.833
Sure, I just thought
you'd want to see this first.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.841
-I'm no poker player, but it looks like--
-We're screwed.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.927
...and UFreightEze will handle
both the supply chain

33:33.011 --> 33:35.513
and shipping, which is,
of course, their specialty.

33:37.890 --> 33:39.267
I'll give you this, Lillywhite.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.436
You got moxie.

33:41.519 --> 33:45.106
But we both know Ty Griss
can't handle this volume of brains.

33:45.440 --> 33:49.861
Well, he doesn't have your network
of Third World hospitals to plunder,

33:50.111 --> 33:52.155
but he's gone heavily
into Western health care.

33:52.447 --> 33:55.658
And he's including a brain donor card
in every package.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.870
There're millions of customers a day

33:58.953 --> 34:01.831
getting a direct appeal from one
of the world's greatest philanthropists.

34:03.416 --> 34:06.419
And he'll do it all for 90%
of our original deal with Blaine.

34:07.003 --> 34:10.256
-So, unless you've got a better offer--
-We'll do 80%.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.721
Is that an official offer?

34:18.723 --> 34:19.766
It is.

34:21.768 --> 34:22.894
Hmm.

34:27.315 --> 34:28.524
The billboards stay up.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.860
We need a new face on the brain business.

34:31.611 --> 34:33.946
I'll let the brain plant know
to expect your next delivery tonight.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.158
That's all.

34:47.043 --> 34:49.295

34:50.505 --> 34:53.549

35:09.857 --> 35:11.192
[Don E] What are you doing here?

35:12.985 --> 35:14.153
Better question.

35:15.404 --> 35:17.782
What is nobody else doing here?

35:18.741 --> 35:19.742
We're open, aren't we?

35:20.284 --> 35:21.911
Then why am I pouring my own drinks?

35:22.995 --> 35:24.247
This used to be Tanner's shift.

35:25.206 --> 35:28.751
Business has been under-booming
since your big great profile came out.

35:29.335 --> 35:30.795
We're trying some new ideas.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.215
Which explains that.

35:39.011 --> 35:40.721
I had to do something.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.682
It's our only remaining source of income.

35:43.015 --> 35:45.476
Speaking of which,
I don't think it's good for business

35:45.560 --> 35:47.103
if people see you hanging around here.

35:47.228 --> 35:49.355
So, maybe you can hang
in the back with the girls,

35:49.438 --> 35:50.731
or in the office,

35:50.815 --> 35:53.526
-or you use the back door--
-You just said "our only

35:53.609 --> 35:55.736
remaining source of income"?

35:56.988 --> 36:00.491
You mean, besides the brain-smuggling,
which represents the bulk of our profits?

36:00.575 --> 36:03.244
-That I mean. We're out of the brain biz.
-Please tell me you're not serious.

36:03.327 --> 36:06.205
If you can tell me that you didn't let
that reporter work you like a rented mule.

36:10.501 --> 36:13.546
They got a new supplier,
it's that billionaire UFreightEze guy.

36:14.338 --> 36:16.424
There's billboards all over town.

36:23.097 --> 36:24.515
Why'd you have to keep the mask?

36:39.655 --> 36:42.200
You may be out of the brain biz.

36:48.748 --> 36:49.707
[man moaning]

36:50.917 --> 36:52.084
[woman moaning in pleasure]

36:52.210 --> 36:53.252
[man] Oh, yeah!

36:58.925 --> 36:59.926
Okay.

37:04.597 --> 37:05.806
[man] Oh, yeah!

37:15.733 --> 37:17.026
Wow.

37:21.572 --> 37:22.740
[sighs]

37:22.823 --> 37:23.658
[exclaims]

37:24.158 --> 37:25.701
How'd you get in here? And...

37:26.535 --> 37:28.079
How long have you been standing there?

37:28.246 --> 37:29.580
You left the door unlocked.

37:30.248 --> 37:33.668
I came in around the time
the riding crop came into play.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.795
-Mmm.
-I won't keep you long.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.838
I just need a contract drawn up.

37:38.214 --> 37:39.090
I can't pay you right now,

37:39.173 --> 37:41.550
but I'll make your quo
worth your quid pro.

37:41.634 --> 37:43.386
[Deborah] Counselor Stone.

37:43.719 --> 37:45.930
I need you back in my chambers,

37:46.222 --> 37:48.557
and bring defense Exhibit D...

37:50.059 --> 37:51.102
Oh.

37:51.477 --> 37:52.812
[Brandt] I'll be in in a second,

37:53.187 --> 37:54.146
Your Honor.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.356
[all chuckling]

37:58.526 --> 37:59.819
[Blaine giggling]

38:00.569 --> 38:02.863
You really do go the extra mile,
don't you?

38:03.281 --> 38:05.032
All right, what contract do you need?

38:15.376 --> 38:16.836
[screaming]

38:17.628 --> 38:19.922
Hi! Are you Darcy Bennet?

38:23.843 --> 38:26.429
-I am.
-You got a minute?

38:27.471 --> 38:31.392
Um. Can you run to the dining hall
and steal me a pack of instant ramen?

38:32.393 --> 38:34.020
I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

38:39.233 --> 38:41.569
You're here about
my Freylich brain, I assume.

38:41.652 --> 38:44.530
I take it I'm not
the first interested party to reach out.

38:44.905 --> 38:46.490
So, what's your best offer so far?

38:46.574 --> 38:48.868
One guy promised 50 grand
to my family when I'm gone.

38:48.951 --> 38:50.077
I see.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.663
How does half a million sound?

38:53.706 --> 38:54.957
Cash upfront.

38:55.499 --> 38:58.377
Once my client meets you
and signs off, the money's yours...

38:58.711 --> 39:02.631
in exchange for ownership of your brain
after your tragic, yet inevitable demise.

39:10.639 --> 39:14.060
Hmm. So, what, you were gonna
keep this all a secret?

39:14.435 --> 39:16.979
The big office, the lieutenant's chair.

39:17.063 --> 39:18.439
Acting Lieutenant.

39:18.773 --> 39:20.816
Just till Dale's back on her feet.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.277
How is the LT mom-to-be?

39:23.819 --> 39:26.280
She's good, baby's good.

39:26.655 --> 39:28.240
But she's on bed rest

39:28.324 --> 39:30.576
for the duration. Just as a precaution.

39:31.077 --> 39:34.080
Well, she can't be too happy about that,
but baby comes first.

39:35.122 --> 39:36.582
Look at you,

39:37.124 --> 39:38.584
right at home.

39:39.126 --> 39:40.711
Born to be Lieutenant...

39:43.672 --> 39:44.673
Babineaux.

39:51.097 --> 39:52.765
You need anything else, Liv?

39:53.265 --> 39:55.684
Mmm. A raise wouldn't hurt.

39:56.185 --> 39:57.436
No.

39:57.645 --> 39:59.105
-Can I have a gun?
-No.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.774
-Oh, how about a squad car?
-No.

40:01.857 --> 40:03.526
-Diplomatic immunity?
-No.

40:03.609 --> 40:04.610
Can I have...

40:07.154 --> 40:08.614
[rich zombie] Mr. DeBeers.

40:09.448 --> 40:11.784
I didn't expect results so quickly.

40:12.785 --> 40:13.869
However,

40:15.079 --> 40:16.497
this was not our arrangement.

40:16.580 --> 40:19.834
I bought a postmortem brain,
not the pre-mortem human attached to it.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.919
That's why they say
to read the fine print.

40:22.628 --> 40:25.881
You bought a Freylich brain
upon the death of its owner.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.260
I'm sure she'll
kick the bucket any day now.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.095
Or not.

40:31.512 --> 40:34.223
I could consider expediting the process

40:34.306 --> 40:36.684
for a non-nominal fee, or...

40:36.767 --> 40:39.353
I'd be happy to extend
this offer to the next bidder.

40:45.651 --> 40:48.070
Okay. I can wait. It's a deal.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.322
I'll wire the money now.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.742
[Blaine] <i>So, am I a monster?</i>
