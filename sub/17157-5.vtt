00:09.633 --> 00:12.200
- Remember, Zack,
no mumbling in class.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.133
A good CEO
makes his voice heard.

00:14.133 --> 00:15.300
- Yes, Dad.

00:15.300 --> 00:18.000
- Hey, what's up
with your tie?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.300
Is that a half-Windsor?

00:20.300 --> 00:21.833
- Sorry, I thought
I'd try something new.

00:21.833 --> 00:24.533
- This isn't
a bowling alley.

00:24.533 --> 00:26.633
You dress for the job
you want.

00:26.633 --> 00:29.933
- But I'm a student
and also a child.

00:29.933 --> 00:33.300
- You're a Kwon.
We don't do things halfway.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.100
Now, show me
a full Windsor.

00:35.100 --> 00:37.233
- The rabbit
hops over the log.

00:37.233 --> 00:38.700
The rabbit
crawls under the log.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.233
The rabbit runs around.

00:41.233 --> 00:44.433
- Okay, you're strangling
the rabbit.

00:45.833 --> 00:47.833
- Lawrence.

00:47.833 --> 00:49.933
I think you'll like
today's lesson plan.

00:49.933 --> 00:55.400
Today we're gonna learn
about the revolution of 1976.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.700
- Don't you mean 1776?

00:57.700 --> 00:59.067
- No.

00:59.067 --> 01:01.500
I'm talking
about the punk revolution,

01:01.500 --> 01:04.367
but it's about the same thing
as the American Revolution--

01:04.367 --> 01:06.600
sticking it to The Man.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.233
- You're always talking
about The Man.

01:08.233 --> 01:10.067
I just want to point out
that it's sexist,

01:10.067 --> 01:12.767
and we don't know
who you're talking about.

01:12.767 --> 01:14.833
- The Man can be anybody:

01:14.833 --> 01:19.233
the principal,
the government, your dad.

01:19.233 --> 01:20.767
- Your brother
who makes fun of you

01:20.767 --> 01:22.933
because you're too short
to ride the roller coaster,

01:22.933 --> 01:26.433
even though after he rides it,
he throws up like a wimp.

01:26.433 --> 01:29.367
- Yes, brothers can be The Man,

01:29.367 --> 01:32.767
and in 1976,
bands like the Ramones,

01:32.767 --> 01:36.767
the Sex Pistols, and the Clash
stood up to the powers that be

01:36.767 --> 01:40.300
and said, "We're not playing
by your rules anymore.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.933
"We're gonna play
faster and louder

01:42.933 --> 01:46.067
and wear cool leather jackets
and have weird haircuts."

01:46.067 --> 01:48.367
- So you're saying
we should get weird haircuts?

01:48.367 --> 01:52.100
- I've already got one.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.200
- The whole point of punk rock

01:54.200 --> 01:56.967
is being brave enough
to be different.

01:56.967 --> 01:58.767
all: The whole point
of punk rock

01:58.767 --> 02:01.067
is being brave enough
to be different.

02:01.067 --> 02:04.733
- No, no, just know
everyone here is an individual.

02:04.733 --> 02:08.567
all: No, no, just know
everyone here is an individual.

02:08.567 --> 02:10.533
- You don't have
to repeat in unison.

02:10.533 --> 02:12.933
all: We don't have
to repeat in unison.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.233
- Mr. Finn is the best teacher
in the world.

02:15.233 --> 02:18.133
all: Nice try, dude.

02:18.133 --> 02:21.533

02:21.533 --> 02:23.533
- Hey, guys.
What's new?

02:23.533 --> 02:26.467
- Is there something wrong
with my glasses?

02:26.467 --> 02:28.667
Nope, it's your hair.

02:28.667 --> 02:31.067
- Wow.
You dyed your hair?

02:31.067 --> 02:33.767
- Yeah, pretty sweet, huh?

02:36.867 --> 02:38.500
- That is sick.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.467
- You're prettier than I am.

02:40.467 --> 02:42.667
- Freddy, I dig the look.

02:42.667 --> 02:47.567
You're the first kid in the band
that looks like a kid in a band.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.233
Your hair gets an A+, man.

02:49.233 --> 02:50.667
- Wait, what about my hair?

02:50.667 --> 02:54.900
- Summer, I don't really
give grades for hair.

02:54.900 --> 02:57.300
- I'm expressing myself
like you told me to, Mr. Finn.

02:57.300 --> 02:58.567
I feel totally punk.

02:58.567 --> 03:00.767
- Then my job here is done.

03:00.767 --> 03:02.333
Well, not really.

03:02.333 --> 03:04.633
I still can't leave
until 3:00.

03:04.633 --> 03:06.467
- You're gonna get
in huge trouble.

03:06.467 --> 03:08.200
You know this school
has a dress code.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.900
No T-shirts, no shorts,

03:10.900 --> 03:13.533
no tattoos that say
"Tomika rules."

03:13.533 --> 03:15.533
- It wasn't a tattoo.

03:15.533 --> 03:19.300
It was a marker, and the kid
I gave it to said she liked it.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.067
- No, I didn't.

03:21.067 --> 03:22.367
- You know what?

03:22.367 --> 03:24.467
This school can try
to make us all look the same,

03:24.467 --> 03:26.067
but I'm gonna be myself.

03:26.067 --> 03:27.733
- Awesome.
- Way to go, Freddy.

03:27.733 --> 03:29.200
- I have a crush on you.
- What?

03:29.200 --> 03:30.900
- Way to go, Freddy.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.900
- Okay, let's get to class.
Everyone, get to class.

03:32.900 --> 03:38.200
Oh, my, Mr. Huerta,
what a lovely shade of green.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.367
You know, I use a pen that color

03:40.367 --> 03:42.500
when I write up
detention reports.

03:42.500 --> 03:43.700
Come with me, young man.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.367
- Aw, come on,
Principal Mullins.

03:45.367 --> 03:47.600
When you were a little kid
going to school,

03:47.600 --> 03:50.333
didn't you want to have
some fun, break the rules?

03:50.333 --> 03:52.200
- No, I always wanted
to be principal.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.867
- [laughs]
That's not weird.

03:56.067 --> 03:57.700
- Oh, boy.

03:57.700 --> 04:01.100
- * Stop tellin' me
to read between the lines *

04:01.100 --> 04:03.533
* It all adds up
to one thing *

04:03.533 --> 04:05.067
- Five, four, three,
two, one.

04:05.067 --> 04:07.533
- * If you think you're gonna
lose your cool *

04:07.533 --> 04:10.233
* Well, sometimes you gotta
break the rules *

04:10.233 --> 04:13.200
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

04:13.200 --> 04:15.633
* 'Cause we ain't gonna stop *

04:15.633 --> 04:18.367
* If you're feeling like
you're gettin' schooled *

04:18.367 --> 04:21.067
* There's an answer
right in front of you *

04:21.067 --> 04:23.700
* Hey, show me what you know,

04:23.700 --> 04:25.467
* 'Cause we ain't

04:25.467 --> 04:27.633
- * Hey!
- * Are you ready to rock?

04:30.067 --> 04:32.400
[rock music]

04:33.600 --> 04:35.467
- Freddy's been gone
a long time.

04:35.467 --> 04:37.900
- Maybe she's shaving his head.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.400
- No!

04:39.400 --> 04:42.533
I mean, whatever.

04:44.933 --> 04:46.067
- [sighs]

04:46.067 --> 04:47.067
- You okay?

04:47.067 --> 04:48.433
- She gave me detention,

04:48.433 --> 04:50.767
then showed me a book
of approved haircuts.

04:50.767 --> 04:53.967
Did you know
there's a reverse mullet?

04:53.967 --> 04:57.600
- Well, I'm proud you're not
just another brick in the wall.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.267
Every rebel's got
to start somewhere.

04:59.267 --> 05:01.600
You know, Kurt Cobain used
to strike out in Little League

05:01.600 --> 05:03.067
just to tick off his dad.

05:03.067 --> 05:03.900
- He did?

05:03.900 --> 05:06.733
- Yes. Rock is about rebellion.

05:06.733 --> 05:10.267
Music can change the world.
It has that power.

05:10.267 --> 05:12.533
In fact,
your homework assignment

05:12.533 --> 05:14.533
is to rebel against something.

05:14.533 --> 05:17.933
- I'm gonna rebel
against this pencil.

05:17.933 --> 05:20.100
[grunts]

05:20.100 --> 05:22.067
Later.

05:22.067 --> 05:24.200
- What if we all dye our hair
to support Freddy?

05:24.200 --> 05:25.600
- Yeah.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.367
If he gets in trouble,
we all get in trouble.

05:28.367 --> 05:31.067
- Now we're talking. Who's in?

05:31.067 --> 05:32.500

05:32.500 --> 05:33.733
- All right.

05:33.733 --> 05:34.733
Yeah.

05:39.500 --> 05:42.233
- Whoa, you did it.
Thanks, guys.

I'm a rebel.

05:44.067 --> 05:46.500
Neat-o!

05:46.500 --> 05:48.100
- Rebels don't say "neat-o."

05:48.100 --> 05:49.333
- This one does.

05:49.333 --> 05:51.733
- You all look great.

05:51.733 --> 05:55.333
I'm still perfecting
my technique.

06:01.567 --> 06:04.600

06:04.600 --> 06:05.900
- Sorry, man.
I couldn't do it.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.500
You know how intense
my dad is.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.533
Our goldfish hides in the castle
whenever he walks into the room.

06:10.533 --> 06:12.133
- It's cool.

06:12.133 --> 06:14.733
How is Luther?

06:14.733 --> 06:16.433
- Hanging in.
I brought him with me.

06:16.433 --> 06:18.400
He needed a break.
- Mm.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.567
- What is going on here?

06:20.567 --> 06:22.167
- We're supporting Freddy

06:22.167 --> 06:26.200
and expressing ourselves through
civil disobedience and hair dye.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.900
- Mostly through hair dye.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.500
- Wait, we were supposed
to use hair dye?

06:30.500 --> 06:33.733
I used grape-flavored drink mix.

06:33.733 --> 06:37.667
- Well, Freddy, seems
your bad attitude is contagious.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.867
Do you all want detention?

06:39.867 --> 06:44.533
- If there's a choice,
I'm gonna go with no.

06:44.533 --> 06:46.267
- There's nothing
in the code of conduct

06:46.267 --> 06:47.667
that mentions hair color.

06:47.667 --> 06:50.800
- Dyed hair is distracting
and disrespectful.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.233
It is the equivalent
of mouthing off.

06:53.233 --> 06:56.233
Your hair should be quiet.

06:56.233 --> 06:59.267
- So no one in the school
is allowed to dye their hair?

06:59.267 --> 07:00.700
- Of course not.

07:00.700 --> 07:03.067
- So you don't color your hair?

07:03.067 --> 07:06.600
- Okay, well, just my roots
and a few natural highlights.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.633
I'm prematurely gray.

07:08.633 --> 07:10.600
I get a white line on my scalp.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.233

Tomorrow I'm gonna dye my hair
with chocolate frosting.

07:27.633 --> 07:30.067
- All right,

No matter how long it takes,
no matter how hard the journey,

we weren't in trouble.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.100
all: Yeah.
- What?

07:41.100 --> 07:44.533
But I wrote a whole protest song
on hair grooming.

07:44.533 --> 07:46.233
* Follicles of freedom

07:46.233 --> 07:50.300
* Great locks of liberty

07:50.300 --> 07:53.067
Now it just feels anticlimactic.

07:53.067 --> 07:54.800
- You were right,
Mr. Finn.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.933
That "challenge authority" stuff
really works.

07:57.933 --> 08:00.567
You know what?
I'm with you guys now.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.567
I'm going to do what I want.

08:01.567 --> 08:02.567
- Yeah.
- Yeah, dude.

08:02.567 --> 08:03.567
- Yeah.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.167
- Get it.

08:05.167 --> 08:06.333
- Yeah!

you're doing?

08:39.100 --> 08:42.700
- Uh, remembering
that my door doesn't lock.

- You were supposed to be
practicing classical guitar.

Rock doesn't get you into Yale.

Is that orange in your hair?

08:50.267 --> 08:52.733
What has gotten into you?

08:52.733 --> 08:54.333
- My teacher, Mr. Finn,

08:54.333 --> 08:56.967
told us to question authority
and never back down.

08:56.967 --> 08:59.300
- And you think
that's a valuable lesson?

Even though
I'm not a real teacher,

09:28.400 --> 09:31.133
I've taught you all
a very valuable lesson:

09:31.133 --> 09:34.900
Breaking rules you don't
believe in always works out.

switch classes.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.267
What about the band?

09:54.267 --> 09:56.100
- We were all starting to gel.

09:56.100 --> 09:57.533
We can't start over now.

09:57.533 --> 09:58.767
- You sit in front of me.

09:58.767 --> 10:00.333
I sit in back of you.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.800
It's our thing.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.700
- I don't have
a choice, okay?

10:05.700 --> 10:09.233
My dad lost it when he caught me
playing my electric guitar.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.167
But don't worry.
He doesn't know about the band.

10:11.167 --> 10:12.767
- This is outrageous!

10:12.767 --> 10:14.900
If we've been looking
for something to fight for,

10:14.900 --> 10:16.267
we've found it.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.500
Believe me, Zack,
we're gonna protest

10:18.500 --> 10:21.300
until you're back in this room
where you belong.

10:21.300 --> 10:22.500
all: Yeah!

10:22.500 --> 10:25.000
- The Man can't tell us
what to do.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.033
I'm gonna go find
Principal Mullins

10:27.033 --> 10:29.233
and show her
just how tough I can get!

10:29.233 --> 10:31.500
Pretty please
let Zack stay in our class.

10:31.500 --> 10:34.400
- I'm sorry, Mr. Finn,
but the decision has been made.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.300
- Pretty, pretty,
pretty please.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.600
That's three "pretty"s.
- Mr. Finn, I--

10:38.600 --> 10:41.967
- Don't make me hit you
with the puppy dog eyes.

10:41.967 --> 10:42.967
[whimpers]

10:42.967 --> 10:46.167
- Okay, that's just creepy.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.200
Look, Zack's father,
who incidentally

10:48.200 --> 10:50.267
is one of our largest donors,
seems to think

10:50.267 --> 10:53.200
that you have contributed
to Zack's insubordination.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.800
- That's ridiculous.

10:54.800 --> 10:58.900
Insubordination's certainly
not taught in my class.

11:01.433 --> 11:03.100
- What is happening?

11:03.100 --> 11:05.533
- Uh, not insubordination.

11:05.533 --> 11:07.100
That's for sure.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.467
- We're staging a sit-in
to keep Zack from leaving.

11:09.467 --> 11:13.067
- What do we want?
[overlapping protests]

11:13.067 --> 11:15.967
We really should've
practiced that.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.967
- You shall not pass.

11:18.967 --> 11:20.600
- Okay, that's cute.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.367
Let's go, Zack.

11:22.367 --> 11:24.633
- [sighs]
Thanks for trying, guys.

11:24.633 --> 11:25.833
See you.

11:25.833 --> 11:28.233
- Get your class
under control, Mr. Finn,

11:28.233 --> 11:29.833
or I'll find someone who can.

11:29.833 --> 11:32.833
[somber music]

11:32.833 --> 11:36.100
*

11:36.100 --> 11:39.067
- What are we gonna do now?

11:39.067 --> 11:40.467
- I don't know.

11:40.467 --> 11:43.267
I hit her
with the puppy dog eyes.

11:43.267 --> 11:46.667
- What happened
to sticking it to The Man?

11:46.667 --> 11:50.367
- Sometimes doing nothing
is sticking it to The Man,

11:50.367 --> 11:52.200
especially when
they sign your checks.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.400
- So you're caving?

11:55.400 --> 11:59.067
- I'm beginning to rethink
chaining myself to the desk.

11:59.067 --> 12:00.667
- Where's the key?

12:00.667 --> 12:04.500
- I'm also beginning
to rethink swallowing the key.

12:11.433 --> 12:13.600
[rock music]

12:13.600 --> 12:18.333
- In 1843,
Congress appropriated $30,000

12:18.333 --> 12:21.867
to test the practicability
of establishing a system

12:21.867 --> 12:27.300
of electromagnetic
communication.

12:27.300 --> 12:28.567
It--

12:30.633 --> 12:32.633
Ah, a foundling.

12:32.633 --> 12:34.067
- I'm Zack.

12:34.067 --> 12:35.433
Just got transferred
from Mr. Finn's room.

12:35.433 --> 12:37.800
- Well, Zack,
can you keep a secret?

12:37.800 --> 12:38.800
- Yes.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.333
- We do something in this class

12:40.333 --> 12:43.100
that is technically
against the rules

12:43.100 --> 12:45.567
but really ups the fun factor.

12:45.567 --> 12:48.067
- Really? What?

12:48.067 --> 12:50.433
- We do extra math.

12:54.100 --> 12:57.800
- [whispers]
There's no fun factor.

12:57.800 --> 13:01.533
[rock music]

13:01.533 --> 13:03.267
- Look, guys.

13:03.267 --> 13:05.400
I know you're mad
they took Zack away.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.333
I know you're mad
at the administration.

13:08.333 --> 13:10.233
I know you're mad
that the strawberry milk

13:10.233 --> 13:14.267
in the cafeteria sounded
so much better than it tasted!

13:14.267 --> 13:16.800
- We're not mad about that.

13:16.800 --> 13:20.467
- Well, I am.
That stuff's disgusting.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.067
But I think
I have a solution

13:22.067 --> 13:25.433
that will solve
all your problems--

13:25.433 --> 13:27.667
water balloons!

13:27.667 --> 13:30.500
- How is this going to help us
get Zack back?

13:30.500 --> 13:31.867
- Oh, it won't,

13:31.867 --> 13:34.367
but it will help us
work out our frustrations.

13:34.367 --> 13:37.633
So you write
who or what you're mad at

13:37.633 --> 13:39.233
on these water balloons,

13:39.233 --> 13:42.100
and we'll smash them
against the wall.

13:42.100 --> 13:44.067
You know who I'm angry at?

13:44.067 --> 13:45.633
The Man.

13:48.267 --> 13:51.400
Oh, yeah!
I already feel better.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.467
Go on.
Don't be shy.

13:52.467 --> 13:54.600
Take one.
Get after it.

13:54.600 --> 13:58.400
Nice, yeah.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.167
Okay, that one says
"Mr. Finn."

14:00.167 --> 14:02.900
Ha ha, good one.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.267
Another "Mr. Finn."

14:04.267 --> 14:07.167
That must be a typo.

14:07.167 --> 14:08.200
Now we're talking.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.833
That one says "Mr. Simm."

14:09.833 --> 14:11.333
I don't know who that is.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.833
- It says "Mr. Finn."

14:12.833 --> 14:15.700
I have bad handwriting.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.933
- Seriously?

14:17.933 --> 14:20.467
All of you are mad at me?

14:20.467 --> 14:22.733
You're supposed to be mad
at The Man.

14:22.733 --> 14:26.967
- I'm sorry, Mr. Finn,
but technically you are The Man.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.667
- I can't be The Man.

14:28.667 --> 14:29.833
I hate The Man.

14:29.833 --> 14:31.367
- You're the teacher.

14:31.367 --> 14:33.767
- That was a low blow.

14:33.767 --> 14:36.467
- You're the one who told us
to challenge the system,

14:36.467 --> 14:38.067
but then, when things got tough,

14:38.067 --> 14:41.400
you asked us
to throw water balloons.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.800
- You guys are right.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.267
I let you down.

14:46.267 --> 14:49.533
I am The Man.

14:49.533 --> 14:51.433
Let me have it.

14:54.600 --> 14:58.433
Okay, glad we got that
out of our system.

15:01.633 --> 15:02.867
Are we done?

15:02.867 --> 15:06.500
Good, because--

15:06.500 --> 15:09.533
because I'm gonna prove to you
that I'm not The Man.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.500
I'm not gonna let Zack rot
in that class.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.767
- So you're gonna stand up
to The Man?

15:14.767 --> 15:17.433
- Yes.
I'm gonna stand right up--

15:19.967 --> 15:21.333
- Sorry.

15:21.333 --> 15:24.733
You give a kid a water balloon,
things happen.

15:24.733 --> 15:26.367
[rock music]

15:26.367 --> 15:28.133
- For more complex sentences,

15:28.133 --> 15:29.800
connect the independent clause

15:29.800 --> 15:34.200
to the subordinate clause
with a dotted line.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.433
I know.

15:35.433 --> 15:38.400
I love
the subordinate clause too.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.067
- Howdy, neighbor.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.867
Can I borrow a cup of chalk?

15:45.867 --> 15:49.067
[all mouthing words]

15:49.067 --> 15:50.133
Ah, thanks so much.

15:50.133 --> 15:53.133
Oh. Oh!

15:53.133 --> 15:54.800
Oh, my.
This might take some time.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.533
[mouths words]

15:56.533 --> 16:00.567
- Okay, the plan is,
he jumps, we catch him.

16:00.567 --> 16:04.333
- That was almost a great plan.

16:04.333 --> 16:08.200
[rock music]

16:08.200 --> 16:09.933
- Ah, welcome back, Zack Attack.

16:09.933 --> 16:11.367
- Let's do this.

16:11.367 --> 16:15.467
- How's about we stick it
to The Man?

16:15.467 --> 16:18.067
all: * We're not gonna take it *

16:18.067 --> 16:21.567
* No, we ain't gonna take it *

16:21.567 --> 16:26.500
* We're not gonna take it
anymore *

16:26.500 --> 16:27.833
- Whoo!

16:27.833 --> 16:30.333
- * We've got the right
to choose and *

16:30.333 --> 16:33.833
* There ain't no way
we'll lose it *

16:33.833 --> 16:35.333
* This is our life

16:35.333 --> 16:39.367
* This is our song

16:39.367 --> 16:42.167
all: * We're not gonna take it *

16:42.167 --> 16:45.400
* No, we ain't gonna take it *

16:45.400 --> 16:51.267
* We're not gonna take it
anymore *

16:51.267 --> 16:59.067
*

16:59.067 --> 17:01.300
- Hey, there.

17:01.300 --> 17:04.867
May I borrow an eraser?

17:04.867 --> 17:07.267
- [mumbles]

17:09.067 --> 17:10.900
[all grunt]

17:10.900 --> 17:11.933
- Nice catch.

17:11.933 --> 17:13.267
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

17:13.267 --> 17:16.200
all: * We're not gonna take it *

17:16.200 --> 17:19.067
* No, we ain't gonna take it *

17:19.067 --> 17:25.767
* We're not gonna take it
anymore *

17:25.767 --> 17:28.133
- * Oh,
you're so condescending *

17:28.133 --> 17:31.567
* Your gall is never-ending

17:31.567 --> 17:36.300
* We don't want nothing,
not a thing from you *

17:36.300 --> 17:40.367
*

17:40.367 --> 17:41.900
- Brownie time.

17:44.267 --> 17:46.367
- Mullins is coming.
Let's go.

17:46.367 --> 17:49.300
all: * We're not gonna take it
any-- *

17:49.300 --> 17:51.067
- Oh!

17:51.067 --> 17:52.733
- Oh.

17:52.733 --> 17:54.067
Oh.

17:54.067 --> 17:56.167
Hi.
- [chuckles]

17:56.167 --> 17:57.767
[rock music]

17:57.767 --> 17:58.900
- Detention?

17:58.900 --> 18:00.600
Wait until your mother
hears about this.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.067
This is not what Kwons do.

18:03.067 --> 18:06.333
I feel like I don't know
who you are anymore.

18:06.333 --> 18:07.333
- That's 'cause you don't.

18:07.333 --> 18:08.900
- What was that?

18:08.900 --> 18:10.100
- You don't know me.

18:10.100 --> 18:11.967
You only know
who you want me to be.

18:11.967 --> 18:13.300
- You're talking back?

18:13.300 --> 18:15.067
- No, I'm just talking.

18:15.067 --> 18:18.733
You don't know what it's like
because we never do it.

18:18.733 --> 18:20.767
If you actually talked
with me,

18:20.767 --> 18:23.333
you'd know
I don't like classical guitar.

18:23.333 --> 18:24.633
I like to rock.

18:24.633 --> 18:26.567
- Don't raise your voice to me,
young man.

18:26.567 --> 18:28.700
- I'm not raising my voice.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.367
I'm making my voice heard.

18:30.367 --> 18:34.200
You've always told me
that's what a good CEO does.

18:34.200 --> 18:37.967
- Wow, Zack, this doesn't
sound like you at all.

18:37.967 --> 18:40.867
- Well, this is me.

18:40.867 --> 18:42.767
The only difference
between me now

18:42.767 --> 18:46.467
and three months ago
is that I'm happier,

18:46.467 --> 18:50.367
and that's
because of Mr. Finn.

18:50.367 --> 18:52.533
So take a good look, Dad.

18:52.533 --> 18:55.533
This is what a Kwon looks like,

18:55.533 --> 18:58.967
and, yeah,
he wears a half-Windsor.

19:01.800 --> 19:05.067
- I know
we're all worried about Zack,

19:05.067 --> 19:06.433
but I'm gonna tell
Principal Mullins

19:06.433 --> 19:08.233
it was all my fault.

19:08.233 --> 19:13.267
Sometimes, you got to step up
and take responsibility...

19:13.267 --> 19:16.667
- Mr. Finn, please report
to the principal's office.

19:16.667 --> 19:17.900
- Because if there's one thing

19:17.900 --> 19:20.867
you need to know
about old Dewey Finn,

19:20.867 --> 19:23.400
he steps up.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.967
- Mr. Finn.

19:24.967 --> 19:27.067
- Another thing about me is,
I will take--

19:27.067 --> 19:29.533
- Mr. Finn,
that's the third time

19:29.533 --> 19:31.100
she's called you to the office.

19:31.100 --> 19:34.267
- Okay, okay, I'm going!

19:34.267 --> 19:35.900
[groans]

19:37.133 --> 19:38.533
You wanted to see me?

19:38.533 --> 19:41.333
- Yes, um,
this is Mr. Kwon, Zack's father.

19:41.333 --> 19:45.300
- Mr. Finn, my son tells me
you've had a big influence

19:45.300 --> 19:47.400
on how he's been
behaving lately.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.200
- To be fair,

19:49.200 --> 19:51.433
he's been in Mr. Fox's class
for a good chunk of the week.

19:51.433 --> 19:52.533
I'll go get him.

19:52.533 --> 19:54.800
- Sit down.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.467
- Right.

19:59.133 --> 20:02.567
Before you fire me,
I have to tell you something.

20:02.567 --> 20:03.700
Zack is a great kid.
You should ease up on him.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.367
And, Principal Mullins,

20:05.367 --> 20:06.867
I've been sucking most of
the jelly out of the doughnuts

20:06.867 --> 20:09.267
in the teachers' lounge
with a straw.

20:09.267 --> 20:11.033
[sighs]

20:11.033 --> 20:12.767
- Mr. Finn,

20:12.767 --> 20:16.767
today I saw Zack speak his mind
and stand up for himself,

20:16.767 --> 20:21.667
something that I could never get
him to do, but somehow you did,

and that's gonna make him
a great CEO someday.

20:24.533 --> 20:26.067
I was wrong about you.

20:26.067 --> 20:30.567
As far as I'm concerned,
Zack can go back to your class.

20:30.567 --> 20:34.933
- So Zack comes back,
and I'm not fired?

20:37.067 --> 20:38.367
Thanks.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.433
Raise?

20:42.433 --> 20:45.267
- No.

21:00.567 --> 21:02.367
Back to borrow something else?

21:02.367 --> 21:05.567
- No, this time,
I'm just taking.

21:05.567 --> 21:07.967
Zack, you're back
in our class.

21:07.967 --> 21:08.967
- Really?

21:08.967 --> 21:10.100
- Really.

21:12.733 --> 21:15.167
- Stay strong, bro.

21:15.167 --> 21:17.333
- Take me with you.

21:17.333 --> 21:18.900
- Yeah!
