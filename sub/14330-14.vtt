WHEN YOUR PARENTS DECIDED

10:14.113 --> 10:15.948
YOU MUST BE THE ONLY THING

10:16.015 --> 10:18.284
MORE IMPORTANT TO THEM
THAN SURFING.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.119
- PERSONALLY,
I WOULD'VE TAKEN THE PONY.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.521
[all screaming]

10:22.588 --> 10:24.991

10:28.961 --> 10:32.264
[kraken roars]

10:32.331 --> 10:35.167

THINK THIS THROUGH.

10:35.234 --> 10:38.337

FOR A GREAT BIG WAVE

10:38.404 --> 10:40.072
TO GET RID OF THAT KRAKEN!

10:40.139 --> 10:41.807

10:41.874 --> 10:44.777
[water rumbling]

10:45.911 --> 10:47.246

HMM?

10:50.082 --> 10:52.351

11:08.734 --> 11:10.403
LET'S GET TO THAT LUAU.

11:10.469 --> 11:11.737
- ALOHA.

11:11.804 --> 11:14.140
THAT MEANS,
"I WAS HOPING YOU'D SAY THAT."

11:14.206 --> 11:18.644
- OH, HONEY, I'M REALLY SORRY.
I APOLOGIZE.

11:18.711 --> 11:22.548
- AND I'M SORRY TOO.
I'M A GREAT APOLOGIZER.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.583
- I'M A BETTER APOLOGIZER
THAN YOU.

11:24.650 --> 11:26.919
- I'M A BETTER APOLOGIZER
THAN YOU!

11:26.986 --> 11:28.220
- NO, I AM.
- NO, I AM.

11:28.287 --> 11:29.555
- YEAH, THAT'S GONNA
HAVE TO STOP.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.463
- LIMBO!

11:37.530 --> 11:39.765
both: LIMBO!

11:39.832 --> 11:41.267
LIMBO!

11:41.333 --> 11:42.601
- FROM NOW ON,

11:42.668 --> 11:44.603
THIS IS THE ONLY KIND
OF LIMBO I WANT TO SEE.

11:44.670 --> 11:47.506
WELL, I'VE ONLY GOT
ONE MORE DAY LEFT IN HAWAII,

11:47.573 --> 11:50.109
SO IF I WANT TO HAVE FUN,
I'D BETTER GET CRACKIN'.

11:50.176 --> 11:52.011
- ONE KRAKEN COMING UP.

11:52.078 --> 11:54.980
[kraken roaring]

11:56.282 --> 11:59.452
I THINK I MADE A PUPU PLATTER.

11:59.518 --> 12:00.419

12:17.603 --> 12:20.072

12:20.139 --> 12:23.008
IN MY BORING CAR...
PAST BORING SCENERY...

12:23.075 --> 12:25.177
PAST A GIANT BORING LIZARD
EATING A BORING BUS.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.212
[lizard roaring]

12:26.278 --> 12:27.179
[people screaming]

12:27.246 --> 12:29.014
WHAT'S FOR BORING DINNER?

12:29.081 --> 12:30.983
- BORING ROAST BOAR.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.352
- WELL, I'M NOT BORED.
I'M STARVED.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.554
- EH, YOU GUYS ARE BORING.

12:37.289 --> 12:38.624
[stomach growling]

12:38.691 --> 12:40.226
MAN, I NEED FOOD,

12:40.292 --> 12:42.361
AND YOU TWO NEED SOME
EXCITEMENT IN YOUR LIVES.

12:46.132 --> 12:47.600
[lizard roars]

12:47.666 --> 12:48.901
both: BORING!

12:48.968 --> 12:50.269

12:50.336 --> 12:52.972

12:53.038 --> 12:55.207
CAN SOMEBODY POOF ME UP
A SUBMARINE SANDWICH?

12:55.274 --> 12:56.208
- ON IT.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.343
poof!

12:57.409 --> 12:59.545
MMM. ATOMIC SUB.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.380
- DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT,
COSMO.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.781
WHEN YOU EAT BEFORE BED,

13:02.848 --> 13:05.184
YOU GET A STOMACHACHE
AND YOU SLEEP-FLOAT.

13:05.251 --> 13:06.418
- OH, WANDA.

13:06.485 --> 13:08.154
YOU ALWAYS KNOW
WHAT'S BEST FOR ME.

13:08.220 --> 13:09.488
IF ONLY I'D LISTEN.

13:09.555 --> 13:11.290
[laughs]

13:11.357 --> 13:14.293
[chomping]

13:14.360 --> 13:17.029

13:17.096 --> 13:18.364
[explosion]

13:18.430 --> 13:21.200
- IT'S ATTACKING
THE JAPANESE FOOD I HAD EARLIER.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.269
- DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU,
COSMO.

13:23.335 --> 13:26.205
- [stomach growling]
UM, WANDA? SOME FOOD?

13:26.272 --> 13:28.240
- AW, NO, THANKS.

13:41.787 --> 13:43.589
TUMMY HURTS.

13:43.656 --> 13:47.059
JAPANESE FOOD SHOULD SURRENDER.

13:47.126 --> 13:48.827
- [snoring]

13:48.894 --> 13:50.329
- [moaning]

13:50.396 --> 13:53.532

13:53.599 --> 13:55.000
[both scream]

13:55.067 --> 13:56.135
- OH, NO.
COSMO.

13:56.202 --> 13:58.938
UH, MOM, DAD, I CAN EXPLAIN.

13:59.004 --> 14:02.007
- IT'S A GHOST...
WITH A PERISCOPE IN HIS EAR.

14:02.074 --> 14:02.975
- A GHOST?

14:03.042 --> 14:04.643
OKAY, LET'S GO WITH THAT,

14:04.710 --> 14:06.178
BUT DON'T WORRY.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.214
I BET HIS GHOST WIFE IS COMING

14:08.280 --> 14:10.316
TO DRAG HIM BACK
TO THE FISHBOWL--

14:10.382 --> 14:13.419
I MEAN, BACK TO THE UNDERWATER
REALM OF THE UNDEAD.

14:13.485 --> 14:16.455
- [moaning]
SORRY.

14:16.522 --> 14:20.492
I TOLD THIS IDIOT GHOST
NOT TO EAT THAT SANDWICH.

14:20.559 --> 14:22.962
- POOF, POOF.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.663
- OUR HOUSE IS HAUNTED?

14:24.730 --> 14:26.999
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?

14:27.066 --> 14:29.034
- IT MEANS
WE'RE NO LONGER BORED,

14:29.101 --> 14:32.037
AND BETTER STILL:
IT MEANS IT'S TIME FOR...

14:32.104 --> 14:33.806
both: THE POLTER-GEEKS!

14:33.872 --> 14:35.307
- THE POLTER-WHATS?

14:35.374 --> 14:37.443

14:37.509 --> 14:41.380

WHO CALL

14:54.526 --> 14:56.362
both: THE POLTER-GEEKS!

14:56.428 --> 14:58.163
- TELL US, POLTER-GEEKS,

14:58.230 --> 14:59.932
HAVE YOU EVER CAUGHT
A REAL GHOST?

14:59.999 --> 15:01.267
- NOT TECHNICALLY.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.435
YOU SEE, WE FIND A HOUSE
WE THINK IS HAUNTED.

15:03.502 --> 15:05.437
THEN WE JUST BLOW IT UP.

15:05.504 --> 15:07.406
- AFTER ALL, YOU CAN'T HAVE
A HAUNTED HOUSE

15:07.473 --> 15:08.974
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A HOUSE.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.009
[lasers blasting]

15:10.075 --> 15:11.010
- [screams]

15:11.076 --> 15:12.511
[explosion]

15:12.578 --> 15:15.047
- ENJOY YOUR GHOST-FREE HOUSE.

15:15.114 --> 15:16.782
- I DIDN'T HAVE A GHOST.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.584
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.653
- WITHOUT EVER CATCHING
A SINGLE GHOST,

15:20.719 --> 15:23.656
THE POLTER-GEEKS HAVE DESTROYED
EVERY HOUSE IN DIMMSDALE.

15:23.722 --> 15:25.024
SO I'VE BROUGHT AN ANGRY MOB

15:25.090 --> 15:27.626
TO RUN THESE POLTERFAKES
OUT OF TOWN.

15:27.693 --> 15:31.830
- NO NEED TO THANK US!

15:31.897 --> 15:33.899

15:37.836 --> 15:39.204
WE EVEN HAD TO CHANGE OUR NAMES.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.806
I USED TO BE CALLED MOM.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.042
- AND I USED TO BE CALLED
BARNABY.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.344
- SO SINCE GHOST HUNTING
RUINED YOUR LIVES ONCE,

15:45.411 --> 15:46.845
YOU'RE NOT CRAZY ENOUGH
TO TRY IT AGAIN

15:46.912 --> 15:48.580
AND RUIN MY LIFE, RIGHT?

15:48.647 --> 15:50.716

15:50.783 --> 15:52.217
THERE ARE GHOSTS HERE,

15:52.284 --> 15:54.053
SO WE BETTER BLOW UP
THE HOUSE RIGHT AWAY.

UNLESS THEY CATCH SOME GHOSTS.

16:17.509 --> 16:19.211
PLEASE PLAY ALONG.

16:19.278 --> 16:22.114

16:41.033 --> 16:43.135
INTO THE GHOST CONTAINMENT UNIT
I WISH YOU HAD?

16:46.572 --> 16:48.607

17:06.992 --> 17:09.962
WE'RE GOING TO HUNT GHOSTS
ALL OVER DIMMSDALE.

17:10.028 --> 17:12.196

IN OUR DRIVEWAY!

17:14.066 --> 17:16.300
- THE BOX WAS CRAMPED,
BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

17:16.367 --> 17:18.002
WE'VE NEVER BEEN CLOSER
AS A FAMILY.

17:18.069 --> 17:19.805
- UH, ABOUT THAT, GUYS,

17:19.872 --> 17:21.339
IF MY PARENTS

17:23.040 --> 17:24.742
SO I NEED YOU TO HAUNT

17:32.418 --> 17:33.786

17:33.852 --> 17:36.221
- NO, THERE WERE
NO GHOSTS BEFORE,

17:36.288 --> 17:38.157
AND THERE ARE NO GHOSTS NOW.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.897

18:54.833 --> 18:56.869
BUT WE'RE SICK
OF SPENDING EVERY NIGHT

18:56.935 --> 18:59.004
GETTING SUCKED INTO A BOX.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.740
- IT USED TO BE FUN.
NOW IT JUST FEELS LIKE WORK.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.876
- BUT MY FOLKS LOVE
BEING GHOST HUNTERS.

19:03.942 --> 19:06.245
NOW EVERYONE
BELIEVES IN THEM.

19:06.311 --> 19:10.082
- THIS IS CHET UBETCHA SAYING,
"I DON'T BELIEVE IN YOU."

19:10.148 --> 19:13.652
I'M GOING TO EXPOSE YOU ON TV

EH, HE'S NOT GOING AWAY,

19:19.625 --> 19:22.661
WE'RE NOT PHONIES.
WE'VE CAUGHT TONS OF GHOSTS.

19:22.728 --> 19:25.464
- I WON'T BELIEVE IT
UNTIL I SEE IT WITH MY OWN EYES.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.833
- THEN MEET US AT
THE SPOOKY OLD ABANDONED MANSION

19:27.900 --> 19:30.269
I WISH WAS
