WEBVTT

01:58.785 --> 02:02.579
There is hurt.

02:02.663 --> 02:06.628
And there is pain.

02:06.709 --> 02:09.333
We are bound.

02:09.422 --> 02:11.252
And broken.

02:13.998 --> 02:17.263
There are none.

02:17.346 --> 02:21.641
Without to stay.

02:21.725 --> 02:24.101
Secret things.

02:24.186 --> 02:26.687
Unspoken

02:29.316 --> 02:32.568
I have known.

02:32.653 --> 02:39.367
The heavy hand I am scarred.

02:39.451 --> 02:46.958
And scattered I have heard.

02:47.042 --> 02:51.254
The very ones.

02:51.338 --> 02:55.842
Oh really matter.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.730
Come on, put the cards in.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.946
Boys.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.825
Come on, batter up.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.368
Let's go hide it.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.339
Boys.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.589
Get on out here.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.101
Let's go.

04:30.145 --> 04:31.771
Batter up.

04:34.358 --> 04:36.859
Uh-huh. Where do you
think you're going?

04:40.697 --> 04:42.573
Who going to be first?

04:45.577 --> 04:46.869
I'll do it.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.746
Yeah, you'd better.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.123
Ah! Strike one.

04:56.672 --> 04:59.382
Strike three. You're out.
You're done, son.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.261
Be a man.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.222
Strike. You're flinching.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.890
Stay in there. Come on, let's go.
Ready?

05:07.975 --> 05:09.976
Strike five. That
was way outside.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.104
What are you swinging
at that for?

05:13.188 --> 05:15.272
Come on, stay in there.
Strike seven.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.151
Strike eight.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.153
Strike nine.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.239
Strike ten. Stay in the box.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.952
Strike eleven.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.829
Strike twelve.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.331
Stay there.

05:32.416 --> 05:35.334
Strike thirteen.

05:35.419 --> 05:36.919
I'll stay here all day, son.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.130
Strike fourteen.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.799
Strike fifteen.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.175
You're watching it.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.645
You stay there.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.817
Strike sixteen.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.987
Strike seventeen.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.989
Ah.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.616
Strike eighteen,
you little sissy.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.118
You're going to cry now?

06:09.202 --> 06:10.202
Is that what I'm seeing?

06:12.247 --> 06:15.458
Strike nineteen.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.655
Let's do this, Cory.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.126
Good afternoon,
Grizzlies' fans.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.295
Welcome to Grizzly Stadium.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.923
And today's ballgame between
your Denford Grizzlies

07:04.007 --> 07:06.050
and the Peninsula Pilots.

07:06.134 --> 07:09.053
Today is Young Life
day at the ball park.

07:09.137 --> 07:12.598
If a Grizzly hits a home
run during today's game,

07:12.682 --> 07:18.646
Young Life will be presented
with a check for $10,000.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.942
Let's go, guys.
Here we go, guys.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.611
Good luck. It's time, guys.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.822
Go Grizzlies.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.157
Hey, Cory. Hey, Helene.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.993
Heard you were chatting up with
Capano at the fundraiser last night.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.538
Oh, come on, Helene, you're
the only girl for me.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.123
I'd better be.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.919
He had to be really drunk to think
that was a good deal. Please.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.547
He'd eat his first born if it
meant signing a new player.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.091
I don't think I
signed anything.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.301
All right.

07:49.386 --> 07:53.055
Don't forget. Home run today.
10K for Young Life.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.640
Okay?

08:06.653 --> 08:09.822
You think Cory will remember
that Carlos is down there?

08:09.906 --> 08:12.491
No clue.

08:12.576 --> 08:15.161
Or even who Carlos is?

08:15.245 --> 08:16.537
I don't know.

08:38.727 --> 08:42.479
Tough conditions for the hitters today.
Sun shining down brightly.

08:42.563 --> 08:46.317
And when you've got guys like Chris
Ashman and Brett Stevens on the mound

08:46.401 --> 08:48.694
it's not at all a surprise

08:48.778 --> 08:52.448
that we have a scoreless game
with only five hits so far.

08:52.532 --> 08:56.368
Cory Brand batting 3-79
leading the league.

08:56.453 --> 09:00.539
And he appears to be a shoo-in for
another all-star game next month.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.804
Hee-yah.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.140
Open your eyes, Blue.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.892
Cory's not going
to like that call.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.727
It appeared to be
high and outside.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.271
De Cruz gave Ashman the
call of strike one.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.988
Strike two. Strike two.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.491
That was way outside. What are
you swinging at that for?

09:36.868 --> 09:38.369
You're going to your momma?

09:38.453 --> 09:40.496
You need to go talk
to your momma now?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.831
Get in the box.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.592
Go, Cory. Three.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.180
And it gets away from
the left fielder.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.723
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.183
He's going to try to score.

10:01.268 --> 10:04.061
Slides and safe.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.399
That's what I'm talking about.

10:10.527 --> 10:13.404
The Pilots are going
to appeal it.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.572
And Cory Brand has
been called out.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.074
What are you talking
about, Blue?

10:20.203 --> 10:22.079
He storms out of the dugout,

10:22.163 --> 10:24.748
and gets right in the
face of umpire Vic Cruz.

10:24.833 --> 10:28.919
He's going to be thrown out
for slamming down the helmet.

10:29.004 --> 10:33.090
And the replay shows he
clearly missed third base.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.719
So, Cory Brand about to
give his team the lead.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.979
Answer you, Blue. Why
don't you cool off?

10:47.063 --> 10:49.273
You're like your brother
Blue over there?

10:49.357 --> 10:52.109
How did you not see that
standing right there?

10:52.193 --> 10:54.403
What are you talking about
I ain't touch base, huh?

10:54.487 --> 10:57.823
Touched it now! There it is.
There it is.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.700
Get out of my face.

11:03.038 --> 11:04.413
Play ball.

11:07.083 --> 11:10.502
And evidently the young bat
boy, he's the honorary bat.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.338
Oh, my gosh.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.467
Hey, what's going on, huh?

11:16.551 --> 11:18.260
Doc, is he all right?

11:21.014 --> 11:23.307
Not sure what
exactly happened.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.559
Is he okay? Can you see him?
I can't.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.395
I'm on, I'm on. As Corey
Brand went into the dugout.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.526
Oh, my gosh.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.617
I think that's enough ice.
Your face is going to freeze.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.452
Dad, I'm fine.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.788
Oh, hey, babe. How are you doing?
He's all right.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.706
I'm fine, I'm fine.
All right, all right.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.583
Hey, guys.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.002
I'm thinking about
sticking around.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.962
What? Why?

11:54.047 --> 11:55.798
I can't leave him like this.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.967
What can you possibly do for him?
I don't know.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.221
Just talk. Find out what's up.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.306
Hey, dude, can I
hold your icepack?

12:04.391 --> 12:07.476
Just for a second, Tyler.
It's an official icepack.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.230
Only players and people
on the team can use it.

12:11.314 --> 12:14.358
And I need it. Here, take it.

12:14.442 --> 12:17.319
Dude, the whole stadium
was cheering for you.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.030
I know. I was like pshhh.

12:20.115 --> 12:23.700
Oh, and then I went
like, oh, yeah.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.870
He's the only
brother I've got.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.083
All right.

12:34.379 --> 12:35.421
I love you.

12:36.673 --> 12:37.923
I don't make it easy.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.592
Whatever.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.560
Hey, bro.

12:49.644 --> 12:52.187
What's this, a reunion?

12:52.272 --> 12:54.064
Why, did she tell you to come?

12:54.149 --> 12:55.691
We should talk, Cory.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.945
Talk about what?

13:00.029 --> 13:01.613
What happened to you
out there today?

13:01.698 --> 13:04.408
Showbiz, bro. It's
part of the game.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.910
I talked to your trainer.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.246
Said your blood alcohol was.
15.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.082
Couldn't find my keys
in that condition,

13:12.167 --> 13:13.750
let alone hit one
out of the park.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.461
It's a gift.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.963
What are you doing
talking to my trainer?

13:18.047 --> 13:19.798
You need help, Cory.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.968
Are we done here?

13:23.052 --> 13:25.762
That kid you elbowed today?

13:25.847 --> 13:29.391
That's my son.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.603
Karen and I adopted him out of
foster care two months ago.

13:32.687 --> 13:34.980
You'd know that if you
read an email or...

13:35.064 --> 13:37.274
returned one of my calls.

13:40.278 --> 13:41.904
I'm sorry.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.993
Want to go grab
something to eat?

14:04.093 --> 14:06.261
You got fat.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.431
Kick your butt.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.724
That's without a
personal trainer,

14:10.808 --> 14:13.060
and I work for a living.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.646
Yeah, what are you, mayor now?

14:15.730 --> 14:17.898
District attorney.

14:17.982 --> 14:21.068
Got my own parking spot.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.445
And a bathroom key. Look
at you, fancy pants.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.322
Congratulations.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.786
How's Emma?

14:32.455 --> 14:34.623
She's all right.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.667
Been hard on her and Tyler
since James died overseas,

14:36.751 --> 14:39.336
but she says she's glad
to be back in Okmulgee.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.842
What do we say we
go get you a salad?

14:45.927 --> 14:48.929
A salad? Yeah.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.556
No cheese.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.746
Good morning, Mr. Popular.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.583
He's cute.

15:19.794 --> 15:22.879
You've been suspended
for eight weeks.

15:22.964 --> 15:26.508
Well, good morning to
you, too, Miss Sunshine.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.845
Come here. I want to
show you something.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.807
"Corey Brand injures bat boy."

15:33.891 --> 15:35.892
A million hits. Already.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.186
It was an accident.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.480
Can we talk about
this later, please?

15:40.607 --> 15:47.446
"Boozes it up in Vegas." 364,908 hits.
That was a good night.

15:47.530 --> 15:51.992
"Drunk at a Strip
Club." 217,402 hits.

15:52.118 --> 15:56.622
You're a disaster. Yeah, well,
I'm a 3-27 career hitter.

15:56.706 --> 16:00.292
"Cory Brand DUl Caught on Tape".
Over a million hits.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.137
Yeah, it looks a little bad when you
put them all together, all right?

16:03.212 --> 16:06.173
But there were a lot of sober
moments in between them.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.552
You still got that
condo in Miami?

16:10.637 --> 16:13.889
Floor is a little warped.
Popped the water bed.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.766
Here's what you're
going to do.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.559
You're going to fly to Tulsa

16:17.644 --> 16:19.353
and drive down to Okmulgee.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.563
I'm not going to Okmulgee.
Oh, yes, you are.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.274
You're going to Okmulgee and
make nice with the kid.

16:24.359 --> 16:27.069
And then I'll arrange a
very public photo op.

16:27.153 --> 16:31.031
The kid has a name.
It's Carlos.

16:31.115 --> 16:34.076
Carlos is going to get a bag
full of crap from the Grizzlies,

16:34.160 --> 16:36.286
and a photo op
with a celebrity.

16:36.412 --> 16:40.248
Then go chill on the beach in Miami
for eight weeks. Yeah, lucky me.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.293
Plus, the Grizzlies want proof that
you're attending a 12-step program.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.253
12-step? They want
you out of sight

16:45.338 --> 16:47.297
until you've completed
eight weeks.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.716
And last but not least,
you're writing a check

16:49.801 --> 16:52.302
for $10,000 for Young Life,

16:52.387 --> 16:55.222
for that homer you screwed up.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.515
I'll see you in Tulsa.

17:06.567 --> 17:10.278
Ladies and gentleman, welcome
to Tulsa international Airport.

17:10.363 --> 17:14.366
Local time is 3:34 and the
temperature is 98 degrees.

17:23.334 --> 17:26.294
Hey, you didn't have to waste so
much money renting such a fancy car.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.003
Don't worry about it.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.676
How do you even get in this thing?
It's got no handles.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.053
We're here to help farm boy.

17:45.982 --> 17:49.901
Oh, man, Mr. Arby's
forgot my curly fries.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.738
Hey, don't make me go
back in there, okay?

17:52.822 --> 17:55.073
That guys nearly cried
when I signed his hat.

17:55.199 --> 17:58.243
He did not. A grown man.
There were tears.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.495
Right.

18:03.207 --> 18:06.209
Hey, don't forget the Arby's sauce.
I got it.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.842
Oh, these are so good.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.327
Come on, let's go.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.585
Thank you, sir.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.634
You satisfied?

19:11.192 --> 19:12.818
Careful.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.945
Were you drinking on the plane?

19:15.029 --> 19:17.864
Let's see what this
baby can do, huh?

19:17.990 --> 19:20.116
No, let's not. Let's.

19:20.201 --> 19:23.161
Would you please slow down?

19:23.246 --> 19:24.955
Woo-hoo.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.628
Cory, look out.

20:10.293 --> 20:12.794
So, my Little League team is
playing the Chiefs this week.

20:12.879 --> 20:16.506
I'm going to start reading
for the Bulldogs.

20:16.591 --> 20:18.300
We're going to run
them into the ground.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.719
They're not going to
know what hit them.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.179
Yeah, I love running
them into the ground.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.515
Hey, go to the car. I need
to talk to this hot rod.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.395
I don't care what your District
Attorney brother says.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.814
I will put you in jail.

20:44.827 --> 20:48.038
Hey. There you are.

20:48.122 --> 20:50.749
You better pray your brother can
keep this DU I under wraps.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.084
You are now facing
a ton of fines

20:53.169 --> 20:55.587
on top of what the Grizzlies
are going to give you.

20:55.713 --> 20:59.007
What do you want me to do? You better
hope for a suspended sentence.

20:59.091 --> 21:03.345
And could you just try to stay out of
trouble while I cover your butt, huh?

21:03.471 --> 21:05.722
Oh, jeez, the kids are here.
What kids?

21:05.806 --> 21:07.349
Stop when you get inside.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.434
My brother has a
baseball team.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.771
Your brother is the
kids' baseball coach?

21:12.855 --> 21:16.024
Why don't you just shoot
Bambi next time, Cory? Jeez.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.275
Cory Brand.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.736
Game face, Cory. Yeah.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.571
Good evening, folks.
I'm Helene Landy.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.907
Did you sustain any injuries.
What happened?

21:23.991 --> 21:26.242
As I was saying, Mr. Brand
is happy to report

21:26.327 --> 21:28.912
other than a few bumps and
bruises that he's doing okay.

21:29.038 --> 21:31.206
Cory, how's your brother?
He's okay.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.042
Clay Brand is resting comfortably
while sustaining some injuries.

21:34.168 --> 21:37.712
What are we talking about? Cory, have
you been suspended by the Grizzlies?

21:37.797 --> 21:39.631
Was there alcohol
involved in the accident?

21:39.715 --> 21:42.759
There was a tractor
involved in the accident.

21:42.843 --> 21:47.305
And... out of love
for his brother,

21:47.390 --> 21:50.183
Mr. Brand has kindly offered
to stay here in Okmulgee

21:50.267 --> 21:54.854
and take his brother's place as head
coach of the kids' baseball team.

21:54.939 --> 21:57.565
Cory Brand's coaching kids' baseball?
That's right.

21:57.650 --> 22:01.403
Lucky team. Do the parents know their
kids are going to have Cory as a coach?

22:01.487 --> 22:03.571
Does this mean you're
moving to Okmulgee?

22:03.656 --> 22:06.366
That's enough. As you can imagine,
Mr. Brand's had a long day.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.556
We'll release a statement
tomorrow following

22:08.557 --> 22:10.662
the team's first practice.
Thank you.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.486
Cory, is the field going
to be big enough for

22:12.487 --> 22:14.226
all the crowds that are
going to be there?

22:15.876 --> 22:17.794
You are way out of
line this time.

22:17.878 --> 22:21.047
No, you are, and I'm fixing it.
Dang, I'm good.

22:21.132 --> 22:23.591
I'm not doing it. Oh,
that should be shelved.

22:23.676 --> 22:27.095
It's on mine by now.
Next conversation?

22:27.179 --> 22:29.514
Now, go see about
your poor brother

22:29.598 --> 22:31.474
while I find you
a place to live.

22:59.170 --> 23:00.670
Hey.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.014
How's our guy doing?

23:11.098 --> 23:12.682
He wants two minutes with you

23:12.767 --> 23:14.017
and then I want you to leave.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.575
Hey, buddy.

23:33.454 --> 23:36.122
A bit early in the
day for a DU I.

23:38.626 --> 23:42.587
I don't know what you're saying.
Don't-don't even try.

23:44.840 --> 23:48.843
I did what I could
for you legally.

23:48.928 --> 23:52.180
I never thought my baby bro
would be bailing me out.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.016
I didn't bail you out.

23:55.101 --> 23:58.269
I'll vouch for you.

23:58.354 --> 24:01.147
Just don't go skipping town.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.244
I'm back.

24:14.328 --> 24:18.123
Just the look of those polyester
bedspreads make me itch.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.960
Okay, kid, listen up.

24:22.044 --> 24:25.130
I found you a 12-step program.

24:25.214 --> 24:26.798
There you go.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.766
You couldn't find me
a normal program?

24:36.851 --> 24:39.352
Well, it is normal.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.187
It's just, um,

24:42.982 --> 24:45.316
with Jesus.

24:45.401 --> 24:47.527
I'm not doing church.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.405
You're doing whatever it takes to
get your butt back on the roster.

24:50.489 --> 24:53.658
Besides, it's the
only game in town.

24:53.742 --> 24:56.119
Celebrate Recovery?

24:56.203 --> 24:59.497
If your career recovers,
trust, I will celebrate.

25:02.251 --> 25:04.169
Cheers.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.171
Yeah, cheers.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.092
Right. All right.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.553
Hey, hey, where are you going?

25:13.637 --> 25:16.306
I'm staying at Tulsa.
I'll drive back tomorrow.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.266
What for?

25:18.350 --> 25:20.518
Apology to the
kid, press event.

25:20.603 --> 25:23.354
The only reason we rode
into this one horse town.

25:23.480 --> 25:27.400
Well, how am I supposed to get around?
You're a big boy. Figure it out yourself.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.235
I'll see you on the
field tomorrow.

25:29.320 --> 25:33.615
And if you're smart, you'll
come ready to coach.

25:33.699 --> 25:37.118
Just remember, you're happy to
be doing this for your brother

25:37.203 --> 25:39.954
and for the children.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.706
Night.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.225
Hey, is that your truck?

26:02.353 --> 26:04.145
You want to rent it?

26:04.271 --> 26:08.066
My truck? Five hundred
bucks for the month?

26:08.150 --> 26:09.359
Okay.

26:09.443 --> 26:12.487
What's your name? Chad.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.656
Hey, Chad, I'm going
to need those keys.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.492
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.494
Thanks, man. Cory Brand.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.330
Yeah, I know.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.708
Hey, Chad, you know, my
fridge in there is empty.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.210
You know what I'm saying?

26:27.294 --> 26:29.587
Um, I could fill it for you.

26:29.672 --> 26:33.716
With dull beverages.

26:33.801 --> 26:38.805
And to remember to keep filling
it with the dull beverages.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.100
Thanks a lot, Chad.

27:02.538 --> 27:06.082
Good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank
you guys so much for coming out today.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.584
What's up, slugger?
Cory Brand.

27:08.669 --> 27:10.753
Looks like you got
your nose on straight.

27:10.838 --> 27:12.630
I am so sorry about that.

27:12.756 --> 27:15.508
Oh, that's okay. Oh, we've
got some Grizzlies gear

27:15.592 --> 27:17.593
that's got your name
written all over it.

27:17.678 --> 27:20.221
Awesome. Thanks.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.619
Let's get that on straight
for the pictures.

27:21.620 --> 27:22.932
Okay, there we go.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.561
Stan, that's Cory Brand.

27:26.645 --> 27:30.064
No duh, Kendricks. It's all over
the Internet that he starts today.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.577
Carlos, how about that
famous thumbs up sign?

27:42.661 --> 27:46.164
Go Grizzlies. Go Grizzlies.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.379
Come here.

27:53.464 --> 27:55.256
Get that camera right here.
Go Grizzlies.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.425
Big smiles, big smiles.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.263
Hey.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.639
Are you ready?

28:03.724 --> 28:05.266
He doesn't know yet?

28:05.351 --> 28:07.018
I don't think so. Oh.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.647
Oh, please, Suzanne is here?

28:11.732 --> 28:13.483
In heels.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.443
She hasn't been
here all season.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.320
I can't believe
you're our coach.

28:17.404 --> 28:19.530
We need major help.
You'll see.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.991
We're not even close to as
good as the Roughnecks.

28:22.076 --> 28:26.079
They can hit the ball so far, like
as far as that building over there,

28:26.163 --> 28:28.164
which is where you can
get the best ice cream.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.501
Ah, it's ridiculous.

28:31.585 --> 28:34.253
Come on, guys, warm
up, tickle up.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.590
Oh, Mom. Come on.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.176
Do I get to call you coach?
Sure.

28:42.096 --> 28:46.015
Okay, everyone. We are done here.
Thank you.

28:46.100 --> 28:47.934
Cory, your suspension
hit the wires today.

28:48.018 --> 28:50.269
Thank you, everyone.

28:50.354 --> 28:51.729
Let's go.

28:51.814 --> 28:53.356
Good luck, kid.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.525
We'll see you around, Carlos.

28:55.609 --> 28:57.735
Hey, Carlos, what's your
favorite ice cream flavor?

28:57.820 --> 28:59.362
Vanilla.

28:59.446 --> 29:01.406
Why are we always running?
This bites.

29:01.490 --> 29:05.368
My Dad says the Grizzlies
suspended Cory Brand.

29:05.452 --> 29:07.203
Pejerski says he
drinks like a fish.

29:07.287 --> 29:10.206
Fish don't actually drink.
They use their gills.

29:10.290 --> 29:13.084
Wikipedia, give it a rest.

29:14.545 --> 29:17.171
Who is that woman?

29:18.465 --> 29:20.758
His agent.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.888
Yeah, I got to go do this.

29:25.973 --> 29:27.640
Okay.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.102
Stomachache.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.271
Breathe.

29:35.858 --> 29:38.359
Hey, hey, hey. Hey,
where are you going?

29:38.444 --> 29:39.944
Home. We're so good.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.821
I'll call you in a few days.

29:41.947 --> 29:44.866
What am I supposed to be doing?
Start coaching.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.576
Cory Brand.

29:50.497 --> 29:53.166
Emma Johnson. It's Hargrove.

29:53.250 --> 29:56.502
I mean, it's-it's been Hargrove
for the last ten years.

29:56.587 --> 29:58.754
Right, sorry. I, uh...

29:58.839 --> 30:00.798
Wow, it's good to see you.

30:02.092 --> 30:03.676
Yeah.

30:05.971 --> 30:11.100
Well, thanks for, thanks for coming
out here today. I appreciate it.

30:11.185 --> 30:14.312
Um, I'm actually one of the
Bulldogs' other coaches.

30:17.733 --> 30:19.859
Yeah.

30:19.943 --> 30:23.237
Look, um, I know you're caught
up in some big PR mess,

30:23.322 --> 30:25.448
but let's be real.

30:25.532 --> 30:28.367
These parents are never going to
go for you coaching their kids.

30:28.452 --> 30:30.411
The are saltof-the-earth people.

30:30.496 --> 30:33.581
And you're pretty much just
a wild child felon to them.

30:33.665 --> 30:36.417
Wild child felon or not, you
guys are short a coach.

30:36.502 --> 30:39.879
Yeah, but we don't need you.

30:39.963 --> 30:42.215
Here comes the truth. I mean,
they'll probably tell you

30:42.299 --> 30:44.634
that they've got a volunteer
and you can be on your way.

30:44.718 --> 30:48.387
Dan Stanton. I own the hardware
store and gas station.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.306
Welcome home, Cory.
Cory Brand.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.183
Greg Kendricks. It's
an honor to meet you.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.602
We're thrilled to
have you here.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.063
It's a real treat for these kids.
Not to mention us Dads.

30:57.147 --> 30:59.815
If you need anything, please
feel free to call the store.

30:59.900 --> 31:02.818
Awesome. Thanks, guys.
That's great.

31:02.903 --> 31:05.029
Right.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.533
See you.

31:08.617 --> 31:12.620
So... ready to get
started, Coach?

31:14.623 --> 31:16.874
Look, these kids will like
you and you will leave them,

31:16.959 --> 31:18.960
so keep your distance.

31:19.044 --> 31:21.963
Third base is yours. It's
your only responsibility.

31:22.047 --> 31:25.007
Mom, can we do something else?
It's so hot.

31:25.092 --> 31:27.760
Tyler, you can't just walk over here.
It's just so hot.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.472
Oh, hi, I'm Tyler. Hey, man.
Cory Brand.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.683
Tyler, get back out there
with the rest of the team.

31:33.684 --> 31:34.934
Okay.

31:36.937 --> 31:41.148
'Em, is that... Look, I'm begging
you, keep your distance.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.070
Third base.

33:57.119 --> 34:00.371
Everything looked fine
on the outside, but, uh,

34:00.455 --> 34:03.207
inside it was a definite mess.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.918
What started as a
private curiosity

34:06.002 --> 34:09.839
became, uh, something
I couldn't stop.

34:09.922 --> 34:13.842
Eventually, I was looking
at porn at work.

34:13.927 --> 34:17.888
Until the day two
security officers

34:17.973 --> 34:23.476
confiscated my computer and
escorted me out of the building.

34:23.562 --> 34:29.275
They had every website and every
minute I spent looking at them,

34:29.359 --> 34:32.777
logged right there
in black and white.

34:34.906 --> 34:39.326
I've... never felt such
shame and embarrassment.

34:41.204 --> 34:44.873
My porn addiction and my
unwillingness to face it,

34:44.958 --> 34:47.376
led to the loss of my family,

34:47.460 --> 34:50.588
my job, and my self-worth.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.091
Depression followed.

34:56.469 --> 34:57.928
How is it going? Good.

34:58.013 --> 35:00.306
John Townsend.
Folks call me J.T.

35:00.390 --> 35:02.516
Yes, my agent told
me to find you.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.102
You're the one who's going to be
signing off all my paperwork.

35:05.187 --> 35:07.855
Hey, listen, I think I landed
in the wrong room over there.

35:07.939 --> 35:11.233
I'm just looking for, you
know, basic 12-step program.

35:11.318 --> 35:14.403
I think I ended up
with the sex addicts.

35:14.488 --> 35:16.947
Not that I'm judging.
It's just...

35:17.032 --> 35:20.075
You're in the right room. Just takes
a while to know it sometimes.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.703
Here's how it works.

35:22.788 --> 35:25.831
After the main meeting, we
break into small groups.

35:25.916 --> 35:29.668
We call open share, where we talk about
anything from chemically dependent,

35:29.753 --> 35:32.087
sexual addictions,
childhood abuse,

35:32.172 --> 35:34.298
eating disorders and so on.

35:34.382 --> 35:37.218
Huh. What if you
have them all?

35:38.929 --> 35:41.764
If you have them all,
then one day at a time.

35:41.848 --> 35:45.309
I'm the ministry leader, so if you
have any questions, concerns,

35:45.393 --> 35:47.603
jokes you feel like
you need to tell,

35:47.687 --> 35:50.022
I'm the one to talk to.

35:50.106 --> 35:53.025
Uh, well, I think I'm going
to head back in there.

35:53.109 --> 35:55.277
All right. Good to meet you.

35:55.362 --> 35:59.156
Yeah, I still can't believe people
are talking like that in church.

35:59.241 --> 36:01.283
Good to have you, Cory.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.035
Thanks.

36:06.540 --> 36:09.416
But God changed everything.

36:09.501 --> 36:12.002
He changed me.
Long story short.

36:12.087 --> 36:15.297
My wife and I were reunited
in marriage last August.

36:18.343 --> 36:22.137
Because of my time in
Celebrate Recovery,

36:22.222 --> 36:24.807
I know how to run to God

36:24.891 --> 36:28.060
and his people
when I need help.

36:28.144 --> 36:32.648
And he does help me everytime.

36:32.732 --> 36:35.067
Thank you for
letting me share.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.499
Welcome to everyone
to open share.

36:50.584 --> 36:52.960
I'm J.T. I'm a grateful
believer of Jesus.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.337
I'm currently struggling
with alcoholism.

36:55.422 --> 36:56.839
Hey, J.T.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.844
My name is Rick, and,
uh, I'm a Christian.

37:01.928 --> 37:04.388
And I'm struggling with
cocaine addiction.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.142
Hi, Rick.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.148
Oh, I'm Cory. Currently
struggling with my agent.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.734
We're glad you're here, Cory.

37:19.779 --> 37:21.697
Hey, Coach.

37:21.781 --> 37:23.240
What's up, slugger?

37:23.325 --> 37:25.451
Hey, Coach. Hey, Tyler.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.912
You guys ready to work hard today?
Yes, sir.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.997
How weird is this for you.

37:30.081 --> 37:33.918
Weird? Actually
more like scary.

37:34.002 --> 37:36.962
So, what are we going
to practice today?

37:37.088 --> 37:40.507
Sliding? No, we need to
practice our batting.

37:40.592 --> 37:43.552
We suck. I mean stink.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.348
Could always work on winning.
That'd be nice.

37:47.432 --> 37:49.642
You're having any
feelings for him?

37:49.726 --> 37:53.437
You can't be serious. Yeah, actually
I'm feeling that he's in my space

37:53.521 --> 37:56.190
and he needs to go off to
his big far away life.

37:56.274 --> 37:59.276
Hey, hey, Tyler. Tyler,
come check this out.

37:59.361 --> 38:01.779
Your mum and Cory Brand were the
best couple in high school.

38:01.863 --> 38:04.531
No way.

38:04.616 --> 38:07.117
First comes love, then comes
marriage, then comes...

38:07.202 --> 38:09.703
Mom, why didn't you tell me?

38:09.788 --> 38:11.580
Tell you what? Where
did you get that?

38:11.665 --> 38:14.124
My Dad. Oh, really?
Remind me to thank him.

38:14.209 --> 38:16.569
You know, I'm going to keep this
until after practice, okay?

38:16.670 --> 38:19.421
Keep what? It's nothing.
Let's go.

38:19.547 --> 38:20.839
What is it? Nothing.

38:20.924 --> 38:23.133
Let me see. No.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.303
It's our year book. Yeah.

38:26.388 --> 38:28.097
What do we go here, boys?

38:28.181 --> 38:31.600
Look at how adorable you are.

38:31.685 --> 38:34.019
Okay.

38:34.104 --> 38:38.565
Hey, Coach, does this mean that
you and Coach Emma K-l-S-S-E-D?

38:38.650 --> 38:40.359
Carlos.

38:40.443 --> 38:42.778
Oh, you think you're
F-U-N-N-Y, don't you?

38:42.862 --> 38:47.241
How about you get out on the field
for a K-I-C-K your B-U-T-T-Ses?

38:47.325 --> 38:48.951
Let's go, boys.

38:49.035 --> 38:52.496
You can keep that. Okay.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.373
All right, let's
go practice, guys.

38:54.457 --> 38:57.084
Oh, my gosh.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.003
Yeah.

39:00.255 --> 39:01.797
Atta boy.

39:06.219 --> 39:09.430
All right, Kendricks. Let's
go, let's bring our boy in.

39:11.099 --> 39:13.183
Show us how it's done, girl.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.691
Right. Time out, time out.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.234
Kendricks, come here.

39:24.738 --> 39:26.363
You're a leftie just like me.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.745
You're two steps
closer to first base.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.497
So lay down the right bunt.
But there's two outs.

39:35.582 --> 39:37.833
Yeah, I know. Trust me.

39:37.917 --> 39:40.127
Think like a gazelle, huh?

39:40.211 --> 39:41.837
Never look back.

39:41.921 --> 39:44.256
All right, let's
go, Kendricks.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.056
Nice!

39:55.935 --> 39:57.603
Nice bunt, Kendricks.

39:57.687 --> 39:59.813
Nice job, Kendricks.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.733
It's good.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.947
Okay, when I touch my ear,
that's the indicator, all right?

40:09.032 --> 40:11.533
We're going to slide,
we're going to steal,

40:11.618 --> 40:13.869
we're going to work
on our double cuts.

40:13.953 --> 40:17.081
Our pitch outs and
our infield shifts.

40:17.165 --> 40:19.333
We're going to double
steal, hit and run,

40:19.417 --> 40:21.251
and suicide squeeze.

40:25.298 --> 40:27.925
We're going to fart in
some runs if we have to.

40:28.009 --> 40:32.054
Give me two laps, and I'll see
you at the game on Saturday.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.640
Let's go, Stanton. That
means you, too, buddy.

46:06.180 --> 46:07.973
Play ball.

46:14.272 --> 46:16.231
Come on, Caleb,
just like practice.

46:16.315 --> 46:17.941
Let's go.

46:21.154 --> 46:22.696
Hitting strikes, buddy.

46:27.452 --> 46:31.079
Caleb, you need to step up in
the big boy jeans right now.

46:31.164 --> 46:34.374
Start throwing strikes at this team.
They can't hit them.

46:34.459 --> 46:36.960
It's the Bulldogs for
crying out loud.

46:37.044 --> 46:41.506
Let's play ball.
Let's go, batter.

46:41.591 --> 46:43.967
Look at me son. What did I tell you?
I said strike...

46:44.051 --> 46:45.802
Nice work. I will
step into it.

46:45.887 --> 46:48.680
I will pull you first thing.
Don't make me.

46:48.764 --> 46:50.348
I won't tell you again.

46:50.433 --> 46:53.810
Say yes, sir.

46:53.895 --> 46:56.104
What do you say we
lighten up, huh, Coach?

46:56.189 --> 47:00.317
And what do you say you play your
game, all right? That's my boy.

47:00.401 --> 47:03.028
All right, Tyler, my man.
Let's go, buddy.

47:03.112 --> 47:05.280
Come on now, we got two more.

47:05.364 --> 47:07.449
I say now shore
up that stance.

47:07.533 --> 47:09.784
A little bit closer now.

47:09.869 --> 47:12.078
That's okay, Tyler, you
stand wherever you want.

47:12.163 --> 47:13.643
I know where that
ball is going to go.

47:13.706 --> 47:16.416
Yeah, just don't step into it.

47:22.006 --> 47:24.132
A little bit
closer now, Tyler.

47:24.217 --> 47:27.928
You stand wherever
feels right, baby.

47:32.725 --> 47:34.768
Ball. Look at me, son.

47:34.852 --> 47:38.021
I'll call your sister. I
will call your sister.

47:38.105 --> 47:40.482
I'll embarrass you in front of
everybody out here right now.

47:40.566 --> 47:42.275
You understand me?

47:45.530 --> 47:47.322
Son.

47:47.406 --> 47:49.824
That's not what we
trained for, is it?

47:49.909 --> 47:53.119
Now start throwing strikes at this team.
They can't hit them.

47:53.204 --> 47:55.872
What? You questioning
my coaching?

47:58.501 --> 47:59.668
Come on.

48:01.837 --> 48:03.797
Strike one. See how
easy that was?

48:03.881 --> 48:07.008
Hey, Coach, all day long.
All day long.

48:10.888 --> 48:12.931
Come on, Caleb.

48:15.893 --> 48:17.519
Strike two.

48:17.603 --> 48:21.523
Caleb, two strikes.
You know that, right?

48:21.607 --> 48:23.900
Can't hit a ball looking at it.
Swing at it.

48:23.985 --> 48:27.487
Swing at the ball next time.

48:27.572 --> 48:30.532
Step into play and swing at it.
Get your head in the game.

48:32.326 --> 48:33.910
Strike three. You're out.

48:35.246 --> 48:37.414
Let's go. Hey, son.

48:37.498 --> 48:41.042
When I said get your head in the
game, I didn't mean miss the ball...

48:41.127 --> 48:44.087
Get over and pick that bat up.
Pick that bat up.

48:46.507 --> 48:48.341
Let me tell you something.

48:48.426 --> 48:51.052
Sit down. You're benched.
You understand me?

48:51.137 --> 48:54.014
What you say we
lighten it up, Coach.

48:54.098 --> 48:56.099
I'll deal with you in a minute.
Sit down.

48:56.183 --> 48:58.143
What did you just say to me?
Let's go, Bulldogs.

48:58.269 --> 49:00.395
I said let's take it easy, coach.
Did you now?

49:00.479 --> 49:02.981
Where do you think he learned
that kind of attitude from, Cory?

49:03.065 --> 49:06.610
Hey, Dad! Shut up, son.
You sit down.

49:06.694 --> 49:09.571
Watching idiots
like you, Cory.

49:09.655 --> 49:11.573
Cory Brand back in
town, aren't you?

49:11.657 --> 49:13.617
You know what? Let me smell.

49:13.701 --> 49:16.036
Apple doesn't fall too far
from the tree now, does it?

49:16.120 --> 49:18.121
You know what you are, Cory?

49:18.205 --> 49:20.790
You're a showboat and you're a
drunk, just like your old man.

49:23.502 --> 49:25.670
You are both out of here.

49:27.465 --> 49:29.174
Thanks, Tony.

49:46.817 --> 49:49.611
Nice going, Cory. I
wasn't drinking.

49:49.695 --> 49:52.238
You weren't arrested
for drinking.

49:52.323 --> 49:56.451
Hey, I stood up for that kid the way
no one stood up for me with Dad.

49:56.535 --> 49:59.120
You're looking more like
him every day, Cory.

49:59.205 --> 50:01.748
That's because I was
taking all your hits.

50:01.832 --> 50:04.209
All my hits?

50:04.293 --> 50:06.670
What do you think happened
after you left, huh?

50:06.754 --> 50:09.464
You're not the only one that
grew up in that house, Cory.

50:11.676 --> 50:13.843
Yeah, walk away.

50:13.928 --> 50:16.137
That's what you do best, Cory.

50:26.399 --> 50:28.024
What? You're killing me.

50:28.109 --> 50:30.985
Assaulted an officer?
It wasn't assault.

50:31.070 --> 50:33.071
This is your lying low?

50:33.155 --> 50:35.156
And uploaded photo went
from Facebook to...

50:35.241 --> 50:37.283
Just fix it.

50:37.368 --> 50:39.369
It might take a little effort,

50:39.453 --> 50:42.163
but I'm sure you
can handle it.

50:57.638 --> 51:00.640
My name is Rick.
I'm a Christian.

51:00.725 --> 51:03.560
I was struggling with
cocaine addiction.

51:03.644 --> 51:06.521
Hi, Rick.

51:06.605 --> 51:09.482
I came to CR not for
recovery from crack,

51:09.567 --> 51:12.610
but to fake it so that
my wife and family

51:12.695 --> 51:14.779
would get off my back.

51:14.864 --> 51:17.699
I came every week, I
did all the lessons.

51:17.783 --> 51:20.910
And to my surprise, I began
dealing with my past.

51:20.995 --> 51:23.747
I started to
understand why I used.

51:23.831 --> 51:26.291
No.

51:26.375 --> 51:28.626
When I got to step nine,

51:28.711 --> 51:32.213
make direct amends to the
people you have harmed,

51:32.298 --> 51:35.008
I thought make
amends face to face?

51:38.262 --> 51:40.138
I don't think so.

51:40.222 --> 51:42.265
So, I skipped over that step.

51:42.349 --> 51:45.059
After ushering for two years,

51:45.144 --> 51:47.645
the temptation proved to be a
bit more than I could handle

51:47.730 --> 51:49.564
and I started taking money

51:49.648 --> 51:52.942
from the offering each week.

51:53.027 --> 51:56.863
During this time, I was
in the second-step study,

51:56.947 --> 51:59.949
and I-I wanted to
finally make the...

52:01.869 --> 52:05.872
I needed to finally
make the amends

52:05.956 --> 52:09.542
to the people in my life.

52:09.627 --> 52:11.878
Which meant I had to confess
what I had been doing

52:11.962 --> 52:15.381
to the ministry leaders.

52:15.466 --> 52:18.259
And when I met with them, I...

52:19.929 --> 52:22.305
I expected to be
relieved of my guilt.

52:22.389 --> 52:25.809
I received so much more.

52:27.478 --> 52:30.605
I experienced God's
love and forgiveness.

52:30.689 --> 52:33.900
Now, to complete the step,

52:35.653 --> 52:39.697
I need to make amends
with you also.

52:39.782 --> 52:42.158
Because it's your
ministry, too.

52:45.371 --> 52:47.455
And I stole from you,

52:47.539 --> 52:50.541
and so I stand
here and I ask you

52:52.086 --> 52:53.628
if you'll please forgive me.

53:02.096 --> 53:03.972
The truth is, God forgave me

53:04.056 --> 53:06.474
long before I
came to CR but...

53:06.559 --> 53:08.101
But I still felt broken

53:08.185 --> 53:10.854
and I didn't know
how to fix it.

53:10.938 --> 53:14.107
And then I got here and learned
verses like James 5:16

53:14.191 --> 53:16.985
that told me if I confessed
my sins to someone,

53:17.069 --> 53:19.028
I could be healed.

53:20.823 --> 53:23.241
I still mess up.

53:23.325 --> 53:26.119
I'm not who I was.

53:26.203 --> 53:27.537
I'm changing.

53:28.914 --> 53:30.790
I'm getting healed.

53:33.586 --> 53:35.628
Thank you for
letting me share.

54:16.503 --> 54:19.422
I didn't even know they
made basketball cards.

54:19.506 --> 54:22.884
Tommy. Next limp.

54:22.968 --> 54:25.303
More puzzle pieces.
Oh, I found Nick.

54:25.429 --> 54:27.931
Steve. I found Nick, too.

54:29.767 --> 54:32.226
Hal Osberg. Got it.

54:32.311 --> 54:35.438
Cory Brand. 2001?

54:35.522 --> 54:38.775
Oh, my gosh. Are
there any more?

54:38.859 --> 54:41.235
Uh, just the one.

54:41.320 --> 54:43.738
Dang it.

54:43.822 --> 54:47.116
You can have it. He busted
me on the nose, so.

54:47.201 --> 54:48.785
I think it's bad
luck or something.

54:51.121 --> 54:54.415
Are you bringing it to the game?
Oh, I don't know.

54:54.500 --> 54:57.126
Come on, you got to
bring it to the game.

54:59.004 --> 55:02.548
Yeah, I just don't
want to bother him.

55:02.633 --> 55:04.717
He signed it. This could be...
Fifty cents.

55:04.802 --> 55:06.302
You didn't bring enough money?

55:08.180 --> 55:09.847
This should do it.

55:09.932 --> 55:11.766
If he signs it, this
could be worth a ton.

55:13.352 --> 55:15.228
We are going to be rich.

55:44.299 --> 55:46.175
Bulldogs, huddle up!
Now, come on.

55:51.265 --> 55:53.266
How about some new uniforms?

55:54.852 --> 55:56.019
Grab some hats.

55:58.230 --> 55:59.939
Tyler. Yes?

56:00.024 --> 56:01.983
That's my number right there.
That's you, buddy.

56:05.362 --> 56:08.031
Way cooler than the
Roughnecks now.

56:08.115 --> 56:10.158
Who needs some shoes?
Kendricks.

56:10.242 --> 56:11.993
New Nike's for you.

56:12.077 --> 56:13.828
Here you go, slugger.
Size eight.

56:13.912 --> 56:15.997
Hey, guys, what do you say?

56:16.081 --> 56:18.374
Thanks, Coach Cory.

56:18.459 --> 56:20.001
Thanks, Coach Cory.

56:20.085 --> 56:21.502
All right, we got to win now

56:21.587 --> 56:23.129
'cause we're looking
good, right?

56:23.213 --> 56:24.797
Okay.

56:29.887 --> 56:31.721
Let's go, Bulldogs.

56:36.143 --> 56:37.393
Go, go home.

56:53.077 --> 56:55.078
Come on.

56:57.915 --> 56:59.707
All right, Kendricks,
let's go, let's go.

56:59.792 --> 57:01.751
Good job, Bulldogs.

57:01.835 --> 57:03.711
Nice, nice.

57:03.796 --> 57:05.671
Good work, good work.

57:05.756 --> 57:07.965
Atta boy. Atta boy, Carlos.

57:08.050 --> 57:09.592
Huh?

57:15.641 --> 57:17.934
Syd.

57:18.018 --> 57:20.103
Syd.

57:31.198 --> 57:32.949
Come on, let's get them.

57:44.795 --> 57:46.212
All right, Tyler, come on now.

57:46.296 --> 57:48.256
The winning run is on second.

57:48.340 --> 57:50.424
That's it, buddy.
Step up in there.

57:50.509 --> 57:52.051
Come on.

57:54.138 --> 57:56.597
Time.

57:56.682 --> 57:58.432
Tyler, come here.

58:03.647 --> 58:05.606
Tyler, look at me.

58:05.691 --> 58:07.483
How many years you
been playing ball?

58:07.568 --> 58:09.443
Five. All right.

58:09.528 --> 58:12.321
How many hits you got before
you took one in the face?

58:13.740 --> 58:16.367
I don't know. Fifteen, twenty?

58:16.451 --> 58:18.828
Yeah. Fifty, sixty?

58:18.912 --> 58:21.205
Probably. All right.

58:21.290 --> 58:24.750
So, what do you think the chances
are of getting hit today?

58:24.835 --> 58:26.210
Probably not going
to happen, huh?

58:26.336 --> 58:28.212
Probably not. Okay.

58:28.297 --> 58:31.340
Get back in there, step up
to the plate, hit the ball.

58:31.425 --> 58:33.176
Okay. All right.

58:33.260 --> 58:35.761
Tyler.

58:35.846 --> 58:38.014
Nothing great happens
when you hold back.

58:39.516 --> 58:40.683
Let's go. Come on.

58:47.524 --> 58:50.193
There it is! Yes!

58:50.277 --> 58:52.528
Carlos, go. Go!

58:53.864 --> 58:55.364
Yes!

58:59.786 --> 59:01.662
Nice job. Nice play, son.

59:01.747 --> 59:04.457
Bring it in, bring it in.

59:04.541 --> 59:06.334
Where's Tyler? Tyler!

59:08.545 --> 59:13.382
Hey. That's what I'm talking about.
Stepping up to the plate.

59:14.885 --> 59:16.844
Nice hit.

59:16.929 --> 59:19.388
How about that, huh?

59:22.059 --> 59:23.517
Great win today, guys.

59:23.602 --> 59:25.144
Thanks, Coach.

59:25.229 --> 59:27.396
Come on, Carlos.

59:27.481 --> 59:29.857
Awesome game, Coach.
See you later.

59:29.942 --> 59:31.442
Awesome base running, Carlos.

59:33.570 --> 59:36.697
Thanks, Coach. Couldn't
have done it without you.

59:36.782 --> 59:39.158
Come one now. We couldn't have
done it without you, Tyler.

59:39.284 --> 59:40.910
Great job. Thanks.

59:42.454 --> 59:44.247
Thanks. Nice game.

59:44.331 --> 59:47.750
Yeah, we made quite the
team out there, didn't we?

59:49.586 --> 59:51.045
How about we grab some pizza?

59:51.129 --> 59:53.214
Yeah. No.

59:53.298 --> 59:55.633
Come on, Mom. No, I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry.

59:55.717 --> 59:57.677
I've got, uh, you know,
we've got a thing.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:00.680
Yeah.

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:04.725
Have fun at your thing.

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:08.437
Cory. J.T.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:12.608
You, uh, have plans tonight?

01:00:12.693 --> 01:00:17.405
Yeah, you know, some
ESPN, little ESPN.

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:19.532
Probably some ESPN after that.

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.913
Nah, I don't have
any plans tonight.

01:00:25.998 --> 01:00:28.541
You want plans?

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.167
Sure.

01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:32.378
Pick you at your
motel around 6:00?

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:35.298
Six o'clock.

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:37.049
See you then, right?

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:39.093
Don't be late. It's
going to be fun.

01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:40.886
It sounds like it.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:54.817
In a effort to earn
the money you pay me,

01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:57.737
I scored you a national television
interview this Saturday.

01:00:57.821 --> 01:01:00.406
Well, well, well, so nice
of you to finally call me.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:03.284
With the all-star vote coming up, we
need to get you back in the public eye

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:04.994
looking clean and sober.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.871
Get people to fall in
love with you again.

01:01:06.955 --> 01:01:09.457
Oh, please, they've
always loved me.

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:12.918
Ha. That's because I remind
them how much they do love you.

01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:16.005
Okay, fine. Book it.

01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:17.757
Let's get me seen.

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:19.925
Done.

01:01:34.775 --> 01:01:37.026
Hey, J.T., I'll be right back.

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:49.663
So, this is your thing.

01:01:49.748 --> 01:01:52.124
Not very hospitable of
you, Emma Hargrove,

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:54.668
to not tell a poor
stranded fool

01:01:54.753 --> 01:01:56.837
about the Wild
West Chili Fest.

01:01:56.922 --> 01:02:00.383
Fool, yes. Stranded, never.

01:02:01.927 --> 01:02:04.178
You get your Ferris
wheel on, yet?

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:06.389
You're missing life in the
fast Lane, aren't you?

01:02:07.766 --> 01:02:10.393
Yes and no.

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:14.563
Beating the Jets today, that was,
that was a new all-time high for me.

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:21.153
You're right about Tyler.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.531
He just needed to be pushed.

01:02:23.615 --> 01:02:26.659
I get, uh, I get
too caught up...

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:28.035
You're a great Mom.

01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:32.039
He's a great kid. He is.

01:02:32.124 --> 01:02:34.834
Hey, dude, it's Coach.
Come on.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:38.712
Coach. What's up, guys?

01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:41.382
Hey, Coach, we found a rookie
card today at the store.

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:43.926
We were wondering if you
could sign it. Sure.

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:46.095
I didn't know you guys
collected baseball cards.

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:48.180
Oh, yeah. All the time.

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:51.350
I got some really cool
ones back in the barn.

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:53.769
Seventy-three Passy,
Ninety-three Begonus.

01:02:53.854 --> 01:02:55.980
I have Passy and Begonus, too.

01:02:56.064 --> 01:02:59.066
Yeah? Well, we should get together
and compare cards some time.

01:02:59.151 --> 01:03:02.486
Maybe after this we can go back
to the barn and check them out.

01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:04.572
Oh, come on, come on, please.

01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:06.240
Okay, sure. Yes.

01:03:06.324 --> 01:03:09.243
Tug O' War.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.460
To one of the best
nights of my life.

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:23.716
I'm glad you found
a thing tonight.

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:28.637
Good old Oklahoma.

01:03:31.183 --> 01:03:33.934
Wait till you see
this, guys, huh?

01:03:34.019 --> 01:03:36.145
How cool is this. Whoa.

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:42.193
How cool, right? Oh, sweet.

01:03:42.277 --> 01:03:43.903
All right.

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:50.034
Who's this?

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.329
Dad. Your Dad played ball?

01:03:53.413 --> 01:03:55.122
That's your Dad?

01:03:55.207 --> 01:03:56.999
Yeah, he was a great player.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:59.210
He never made it
past AA, though.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.548
Come on, where are they, Cory?

01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:11.263
Where's the box?
Where's the box, huh?

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:15.100
It's not in here. It's a small wooden
box, guys, with a metal latch.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:17.937
All the important
ones are in it, huh?

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:19.939
It's got to be here.

01:04:22.901 --> 01:04:24.652
They're gone.

01:04:24.736 --> 01:04:27.655
I can't believe it! He
must have sold them.

01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:38.374
That drunk!

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:43.837
Oh.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.139
What's going on? Look, I just
wanted to show the kids, all right?

01:04:54.266 --> 01:04:56.107
Okay, boys, come on. Get on
back to the house, okay?

01:04:56.108 --> 01:04:57.947
No, no, it's fine,
it's fine, it's fine.

01:04:58.019 --> 01:04:59.979
Yeah, right.

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:08.404
What is the matter with you?
In front of the kids?

01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:10.531
Stay out of it, Karen.

01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:13.075
No one's touched your precious
stuff in years, Cory.

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:14.869
Look, he did, okay? He
always messed things up.

01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:16.579
He always screwed everything up.

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:18.872
You can't keep playing the victim.
It doesn't work.

01:05:18.957 --> 01:05:20.874
What do you know
about my life, huh?

01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:22.918
What do you know about
anything for that matter?

01:05:23.003 --> 01:05:25.379
You're just some sheltered
Sunday school teacher,

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:27.881
so spare me the lecture
until you've lived

01:05:27.966 --> 01:05:29.758
through something a
little more stressful

01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:32.553
than your kitchen
sink backing up.

01:05:32.637 --> 01:05:34.430
I don't want to hear it.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.600
Let's go.

01:05:51.323 --> 01:05:54.283
Okay, kiddo. Lights out.

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:56.035
Good night. Night.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:58.537
Love you. Love you, too.

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:46.460
Hey. What's this?

01:06:46.544 --> 01:06:48.962
I know, sort of
impulsive, but, uh,

01:06:49.047 --> 01:06:50.422
I wanted to give her to Tyler.

01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:52.633
What? Is that a dog?

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:54.343
All yours, sport. She's mine?

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:56.178
No. Look, it's all there.

01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:58.722
Training crate, food, leash.
What are you doing?

01:06:58.807 --> 01:07:01.600
You can't just come over
here and give my son a dog.

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:03.602
I wanted to apologize
for last night.

01:07:03.687 --> 01:07:06.980
By heaping a ridiculous
responsibility on him and me?

01:07:07.107 --> 01:07:10.776
Come on, Mom. Can't we keep him?
Tyler, we're not keeping the dog.

01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:17.282
That figures, you always say no.
Every kid should have a dog.

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:20.160
You don't get to have a say in
what he should or shouldn't have.

01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:23.997
Look, this whole thing
is so not okay.

01:07:24.082 --> 01:07:26.375
You have to go, and take your dog.
Tyler.

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:32.172
Come on.

01:07:59.617 --> 01:08:01.744
Hi. My name is Karen.

01:08:01.828 --> 01:08:03.704
Hi, Karen.

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:07.082
And I'm a grateful
believer in Jesus.

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:10.544
I Celebrate Recovery from
sexual abuse by my father

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:13.213
from the time I turned
eight until I was sixteen.

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:17.341
While going through these
experiences I felt alone,

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.886
with no one to reach out to,

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:22.264
not one person to tell.

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:27.685
My whole life I had carried the
pain, burden and shame for my past.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:31.523
Even though I've been a
Christian for years,

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:34.818
I hid my pain and shame
from everyone I knew.

01:08:40.992 --> 01:08:43.327
When I-when I
learned as an adult

01:08:43.411 --> 01:08:46.121
that I would not be able to
bear children of my own,

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:50.709
this was the final blow.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:55.087
I felt completely
abandoned by God.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.600
When I attended
Celebrate Recovery,

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:09.645
I wasn't prepared
to experience

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.729
the freedom and relief

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:14.774
I would gain by sharing my
deep hurt with God and others.

01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:20.531
I love that I don't have
to hide who I am here.

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:23.158
I can go to my step
study and share openly

01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:25.452
without the fear
of being judged.

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:28.121
I'm just me.

01:09:28.206 --> 01:09:29.997
Banged up and imperfect.

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:37.089
Because of the work of Jesus, I'm
no longer living my life in shame.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:39.675
Thank you for
letting me share.

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:24.177
Go.

01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:34.897
Run, run. Run!

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:48.827
You're running on.

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:26.323
All right, Bulldogs.

01:11:30.536 --> 01:11:32.663
Hey. Why aren't
you in the limo?

01:11:32.747 --> 01:11:36.458
Why aren't you on your way to Tulsa?
Any of this ringing a Bell?

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:38.835
Yeah, hey, about that,
we need to reschedule.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:42.589
I am about to blow an artery if you
just said what I think you just said.

01:11:42.674 --> 01:11:44.591
No, I'm serious, we
need to reschedule.

01:11:44.676 --> 01:11:47.260
You are not missing
this interview.

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:49.554
The Grizzlies just brought
up a kid from the Springs,

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:51.765
and this kid is good, Cory.
And guess what?

01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:53.767
He's not a pain in the butt.

01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:55.769
You will not say no.

01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:59.022
No, all right? I'm not
missing my son's game.

01:11:59.107 --> 01:12:03.068
Your son? Is this some kind
of line from Green Acres?

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:05.195
No, it's not,
Helene, all right?

01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:07.656
My son's on the Little League
team and I'm his coach.

01:12:07.782 --> 01:12:11.451
Got to go. I'm
going to kill him.

01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:16.623
Everything okay? Yeah, I just forgot
I had this TV interview scheduled.

01:12:16.708 --> 01:12:18.583
Oh, you should go.

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.335
No, I already told my agent.

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.295
Forget it, it's done,
it's over, too late.

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:25.132
Seriously, Cory, it's your career.
Go.

01:12:25.216 --> 01:12:26.883
Believe it or not,
we can handle it.

01:12:26.968 --> 01:12:28.677
No, no, I'm staying.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:31.263
Come on, we got a game to win, coach.
Let's go.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.140
What's up, Bulldogs?

01:12:33.224 --> 01:12:35.434
Huh? High fives.

01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:42.899
Hey, Kendricks.

01:12:42.984 --> 01:12:45.277
What's up, Coach?

01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:47.988
Nice day, huh? Yeah.

01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:49.781
Great breeze.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:52.492
How's your parents? Fine.

01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:54.786
The pitcher is nervous.

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:56.955
Second baseman has
got a weak arm.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.041
Let's shake things up, huh?

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:01.126
You know what I'm saying?

01:13:03.838 --> 01:13:07.007
Stanton, was that you?
Trying to fart in the run.

01:13:11.429 --> 01:13:13.889
You still see that play? Yeah.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:18.393
Run, Kendricks.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:22.189
Don't throw it. On the go!

01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:25.567
Don't throw it!

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:27.194
Go. Go, Will, go. Go.

01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:29.863
Go home! Go home!

01:13:29.947 --> 01:13:32.407
Go home!

01:13:32.492 --> 01:13:35.160
Yes!

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:37.913
There it is. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

01:13:37.997 --> 01:13:40.582
Nice job, Bulldogs.

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:43.251
What's up? We won. Nice.

01:13:43.336 --> 01:13:45.087
What were we training
for all week?

01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:47.339
Are you kidding me, guys?

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:49.841
Woo! Bulldogs!

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:55.430
Get on the bus. Take
your stuff and let's go.

01:13:55.515 --> 01:13:56.765
All right, buddy. Yeah.

01:13:56.849 --> 01:13:58.183
Huh, that's quite a win.

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.393
It's so good.

01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:02.229
Watch your hands.

01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:04.356
Coach.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.609
You got rubbed. It's not an
all-star team unless you're on it.

01:14:07.693 --> 01:14:09.820
What are you talking
about, buddy?

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:12.280
How's the National League going
to win if you're not on the team?

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:13.532
Come on, let's go, son.

01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:14.699
See you, Coach.

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.785
All right, buddy.

01:14:18.621 --> 01:14:20.705
Are you all right?

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:24.918
Yeah, I'm fine. I just... forgot
that news came out today.

01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:27.337
All right, I'm
going to head out.

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:28.755
See you, Coach.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.966
Good game, Tyler. Thanks.

01:15:09.714 --> 01:15:11.923
It's going. It's going.

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:15.427
It's gone.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:27.606
See you.

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:12.400
It's going. It's back.

01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:14.402
Foul ball.

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:17.906
Cory.

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:21.576
What are you doing?

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:27.707
Hey. Well, I was
just wondering

01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:30.669
how you were doing after
the all-star news but I...

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:34.060
Well, I see that you're
the same as always.

01:16:34.131 --> 01:16:38.385
I didn't get the vote.
No, yeah, I know.

01:16:38.469 --> 01:16:40.553
I was upset.

01:16:40.638 --> 01:16:42.889
My career is in the gutter.

01:16:42.974 --> 01:16:44.933
I'm out here wasting my time.

01:16:45.017 --> 01:16:48.061
Well, I'm sure it's very
disappointing for you.

01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:51.398
But then, adults cope with
disappointment all the time.

01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:55.694
Ask me how I know. I know,
I know I disappointed you.

01:16:55.778 --> 01:16:58.780
All right? I didn't just leave
to go play baseball, you know?

01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:01.908
Being a father scared
the crap out of me.

01:17:01.993 --> 01:17:04.369
But I've changed, Emma.

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:07.622
Clearly.

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:12.585
Wait, Emma.

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:14.921
Emma, stop.

01:17:15.006 --> 01:17:16.756
I want to be his father.

01:17:16.841 --> 01:17:18.717
Really?

01:17:18.843 --> 01:17:21.428
Really you want to be his father, Cory?
Yes, I do.

01:17:21.512 --> 01:17:23.763
It takes courage
to be a parent.

01:17:23.848 --> 01:17:27.100
It is sheer bravery
to love a child.

01:17:27.184 --> 01:17:29.144
To be there for them,
to care for them,

01:17:29.228 --> 01:17:30.937
to love them when
they push you away.

01:17:31.022 --> 01:17:34.441
It takes courage to put
your dreams on hold.

01:17:34.525 --> 01:17:37.444
To juggle your own heartache
and disappointments.

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:41.072
And just when you think that you
might be getting the hang of things,

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:43.450
you lose your husband.

01:17:43.534 --> 01:17:48.288
So, now you have no choice
but to just pull it together

01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:51.583
and care for the
most precious,

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:54.753
the most amazing person
you have ever known.

01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:00.925
Parenting is not
for cowards, Cory.

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:03.178
You ran before.
You'll run again.

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:05.430
It was a mistake, all right?
A huge mistake.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:08.308
The old man said I'd end up
resenting you and the kid

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:10.435
the way he resented having me.

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:12.979
He told me I'd screw
up the baby's life.

01:18:13.064 --> 01:18:16.524
And I believed him, okay?
I believed him.

01:18:16.609 --> 01:18:18.860
So, your only choice was
to just write us off?

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:21.821
I didn't write you off, okay?
You went off and got married.

01:18:24.575 --> 01:18:26.409
Whatever's broken
in you, Cory,

01:18:26.494 --> 01:18:29.496
whatever your Dad did or
didn't do, I can't fix it.

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.373
Neither can Tyler.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:33.666
That hurt inside you is
going to hurt Tyler.

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:36.795
It already has. He
needs a father.

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:40.799
Well, he had a father.
But he died.

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:44.427
And James is the only person that
was there for us when you left.

01:18:44.512 --> 01:18:47.138
And that amazing,
unselfish man

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:49.516
is the only father
Tyler has ever known.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.310
And for now that
is how it stays.

01:20:01.088 --> 01:20:02.755
Strike six.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.591
You're standing
there watching it.

01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:06.593
Let me see something
out of you for once.

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:09.637
Strike nine.

01:20:11.432 --> 01:20:13.600
Come on. Come on,
stay in there.

01:20:13.684 --> 01:20:16.519
Get your elbow up. You
can't hit it like that.

01:20:18.272 --> 01:20:20.273
Strike ten.

01:20:22.443 --> 01:20:24.986
Come on, you little sissy.
Stand up.

01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:35.079
Go on, go get it.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:43.880
You going to cry now? Is
that what I'm seeing?

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:45.965
You're going to stand
there and cry?

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:50.803
You know, I-I-I first
thought that, you know,

01:20:50.888 --> 01:20:52.680
Meth could be like
a-like a fun thing,

01:20:52.765 --> 01:20:55.975
and I could-I could
stop any time,

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:59.938
but, you know, I wouldn't
tweak or nothing,

01:21:00.022 --> 01:21:05.443
but... coming, coming
down was hard.

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:10.615
And, uh, I just...
I had to have it.

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:12.825
I stole from my grandma's
purse to get it.

01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:15.662
I couldn't stop.

01:21:15.746 --> 01:21:18.164
So, I started, you know,

01:21:18.249 --> 01:21:20.166
going through these questions.

01:21:20.251 --> 01:21:24.921
I-I-I forced myself to answer
these questions, you know.

01:21:25.005 --> 01:21:29.509
I-I-I found out why I used.

01:21:29.593 --> 01:21:33.054
And I still, I still struggle.

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:36.808
But I don't feel, I don't
feel hopeless any more.

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:40.812
I... It's getting better.

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:44.941
I can... I can feel
myself changing.

01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:51.906
That, that's...
Thanks for sharing.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:04.252
Hey, Cory.

01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:06.838
This is your eighth week.

01:22:10.509 --> 01:22:12.218
Huh.

01:22:12.303 --> 01:22:14.262
Seems so official.

01:22:15.389 --> 01:22:18.016
Thanks. Yeah.

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:20.226
See you man. Hey,
you know, it's, uh,

01:22:20.311 --> 01:22:23.396
it's your last mandatory meeting
but we hope you keep coming back.

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:27.233
Yeah, all right.
It's been good.

01:22:32.906 --> 01:22:34.407
Congratulations.
Thanks, thanks.

01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:48.921
Looky there.

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:18.910
Hey there, boys.

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:22.580
Oh. Hi, Officer Pajersky. Hi, Coach.
Officer Pajersky.

01:23:22.665 --> 01:23:24.332
Mm-hm. What are
you chewing on?

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:25.750
Gum.

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.835
Paid for it? Yes, sir.

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:31.756
Some game you guys
played the other night.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.424
Thanks.

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:35.259
You know we're coming
after you next year.

01:23:36.679 --> 01:23:38.012
I'll see you, Coach.

01:23:39.682 --> 01:23:42.100
Dude, should we
go to my house?

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:43.685
Hold up there, Tyler.

01:23:50.526 --> 01:23:52.276
Looks like you
got a new Daddy.

01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:55.238
What? You boys be good.

01:23:55.322 --> 01:23:57.699
"Cory Brand puts
family first."

01:23:57.783 --> 01:23:59.951
Hey, is that you?

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:05.665
Coach Cory is your Dad?

01:24:20.597 --> 01:24:21.973
Hey, where have you been?

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:23.850
I left you like six messages.

01:24:23.934 --> 01:24:26.185
I got my walking papers.
I'm good to go.

01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:31.357
Yeah, hey, I only got a minute.
I've got some bad news.

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:33.673
You're free-agent now.
You've been released.

01:24:33.674 --> 01:24:35.862
What are you talking about?

01:24:35.946 --> 01:24:39.282
Well, it turns out they didn't miss
you that much these past two months.

01:24:39.366 --> 01:24:41.117
Cory, you're too much trouble.

01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:43.911
Look, it's cool. I've
made some calls...

01:25:24.661 --> 01:25:26.204
Hello?

01:25:26.288 --> 01:25:28.456
Hey, girl.

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:31.542
Yeah, let me ask. Hold on,
I'm just getting inside.

01:25:34.296 --> 01:25:36.047
Hey, babe. Have
you seen Tyler?

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:39.592
Um... Let me call you back.

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:41.135
Come here.

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:53.708
Tyler.

01:26:53.792 --> 01:26:55.209
What are you doing
here, Tyler?

01:26:59.756 --> 01:27:01.507
Hey, what are you
doing here, sport?

01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.552
Get in the car, Tyler.

01:27:06.722 --> 01:27:08.472
Tyler, get in the car.

01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:10.349
'Em.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.186
You had no right.

01:27:14.271 --> 01:27:17.189
I can't believe you used us like this.
Tyler, get in the car.

01:27:17.274 --> 01:27:18.858
Mom, no.

01:27:18.942 --> 01:27:21.068
Tyler. No.

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:30.411
Are you my Dad?

01:27:40.672 --> 01:27:43.341
I have your cards.

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:45.051
Your Dad gave them to me.

01:27:45.135 --> 01:27:48.804
He used to mow our lawn.

01:27:48.889 --> 01:27:50.473
I didn't know they were yours.

01:27:50.557 --> 01:27:51.891
Tyler. I'm sorry.

01:27:57.648 --> 01:27:59.357
Get in the car.

01:28:03.654 --> 01:28:05.363
You lied to me.

01:29:40.042 --> 01:29:41.959
Got your message.

01:29:52.429 --> 01:29:54.638
I can't stop.

01:30:02.522 --> 01:30:05.983
I can't make myself stop.

01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:11.155
I know.

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:31.383
The first step is
the most important.

01:30:31.468 --> 01:30:35.596
Reminding us to surrender
to Christ only.

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:38.933
If you've identified a new area that
you'd like to surrender to Christ

01:30:39.017 --> 01:30:42.770
or if you've relapsed
and you're coming back,

01:30:42.854 --> 01:30:44.814
I hope you'll come
forward today

01:30:44.898 --> 01:30:47.108
and remember this
surrender day.

01:31:19.683 --> 01:31:22.393
Now please stand for
the serenity prayer.

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:29.358
God, bring me the serenity

01:31:29.442 --> 01:31:32.778
to accept the things
I cannot change,

01:31:32.863 --> 01:31:35.072
the courage to change
the things I can,

01:31:35.157 --> 01:31:38.492
and the wisdom to
know the difference,

01:31:38.577 --> 01:31:40.786
living one day at a time,

01:31:40.871 --> 01:31:43.330
enjoying one moment at a time.

01:31:43.415 --> 01:31:46.959
Accepting hardship as
a pathway to peace.

01:31:47.043 --> 01:31:51.630
Taking as Jesus did the
sinful world as it is,

01:31:51.715 --> 01:31:53.757
not as I would have it.

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:56.927
Trusting that you will
make all things right

01:31:57.012 --> 01:31:59.013
if I surrender to your will.

01:31:59.097 --> 01:32:02.433
So that I may be reasonably
happy in this life

01:32:02.517 --> 01:32:06.270
and supremely happy with
you forever in the next.

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:07.521
Amen.

01:32:19.034 --> 01:32:22.953
My father's work took him away
from us most of the time.

01:32:23.038 --> 01:32:27.833
And my stay-at-home mother was
verbally and psychologically abusive.

01:32:27.918 --> 01:32:30.002
As a child,

01:32:30.086 --> 01:32:33.005
I lived in a constant
state of fear.

01:32:33.089 --> 01:32:35.257
I believed in God,

01:32:35.342 --> 01:32:39.637
but I had this warped
sense of who he was.

01:32:39.721 --> 01:32:41.513
And I couldn't trust him.

01:32:43.308 --> 01:32:49.813
Life, for me, was
performance based.

01:32:50.857 --> 01:32:56.654
But, after going
through my step study,

01:32:56.738 --> 01:33:01.408
I now believe that God
is a loving father.

01:33:01.493 --> 01:33:05.037
He's not waiting to send me to
hell for every mistake I make.

01:33:05.121 --> 01:33:08.540
No matter what my childhood
experiences has taught me,

01:33:10.502 --> 01:33:14.046
I am valuable because
I'm a child of God.

01:33:20.095 --> 01:33:21.804
I'm Cory.

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:30.437
And I'm a new believer
in Jesus Christ.

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:36.026
And I struggle
with alcoholism.

01:33:36.111 --> 01:33:39.280
Hi, Cory. Glad you're here.

01:34:39.007 --> 01:34:41.550
Oh, come on, you guys,
this is pathetic.

01:34:41.634 --> 01:34:42.968
You got to at least try.

01:34:45.847 --> 01:34:47.931
Hey.

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:51.185
This is like that movie where
the lady leaves the children

01:34:51.269 --> 01:34:53.645
and then it's not fun
for them anymore.

01:34:53.730 --> 01:34:59.026
Hey! What's that movie called, the one
with the nun and the singing children?

01:35:01.738 --> 01:35:04.031
The Sound of Music? Yeah.

01:35:04.115 --> 01:35:06.283
This is just like
The Sound of Music.

01:35:06.368 --> 01:35:09.703
Except it's not fun anymore
without Coach Cory.

01:35:10.997 --> 01:35:13.332
You're killing me, Carlos.

01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:26.845
Hi. Hey, girl.

01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:28.639
Sorry I'm kind of
popping in unannounced.

01:35:28.723 --> 01:35:30.140
That's okay. You
want to come in?

01:35:30.225 --> 01:35:32.184
Uh, is Tyler here?

01:35:32.268 --> 01:35:33.811
He's around here somewhere.

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:35.562
Let's go out here.

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:44.029
Uh, Tyler called Clay

01:35:44.114 --> 01:35:47.825
asking if we would convince you to
let him go to the ballgame tomorrow.

01:35:47.909 --> 01:35:50.077
Oh, he called you?

01:35:50.161 --> 01:35:52.413
I'm so sorry.

01:35:56.251 --> 01:35:58.043
Absolutely not.

01:35:58.128 --> 01:36:01.046
Look, no, I really appreciate
that Clay and Cory

01:36:01.131 --> 01:36:02.798
worked out some
stuff this year,

01:36:02.882 --> 01:36:05.467
and that your family
is doing better.

01:36:05.552 --> 01:36:07.761
No, I'm just not there, yet.

01:36:07.887 --> 01:36:11.849
Emma... Karen,
people don't change.

01:36:11.933 --> 01:36:14.143
Look, honey, I love you,

01:36:14.227 --> 01:36:17.604
but the only person who's not
changing around here is you.

01:36:19.023 --> 01:36:20.441
Mom.

01:36:30.076 --> 01:36:32.453
All I could say is just
taking it one day at a time.

01:36:32.537 --> 01:36:36.623
I'm in Tulsa now, and just folks
are now doing a good job.

01:36:36.708 --> 01:36:39.376
Would you excuse me? I've got
some really important guests.

01:36:39.461 --> 01:36:41.086
Thank you.

01:36:41.171 --> 01:36:42.713
Hey, what's up, guys?

01:36:42.797 --> 01:36:46.091
Huh? Bring it in.
How's practice, huh?

01:36:46.176 --> 01:36:48.343
Hi, Cory. You look great.

01:36:48.428 --> 01:36:50.387
Good to see you. Yeah?
Good to see you, guys.

01:36:50.513 --> 01:36:52.139
How are you? I'm good.
I'm good.

01:36:52.223 --> 01:36:54.475
They make it? No.

01:36:54.559 --> 01:36:56.560
Yeah, it's all right.

01:36:56.644 --> 01:36:59.062
Did you say anything about the
Bulldogs to those reporters?

01:36:59.147 --> 01:37:00.689
Don't be stupid, Carlos.

01:37:00.815 --> 01:37:03.525
Okay, look, we do get that station.
Yeah.

01:37:03.610 --> 01:37:05.611
You get a player's
discount at the gift shop?

01:37:05.695 --> 01:37:08.071
I think so. Yeah, we can
work something out.

01:37:08.156 --> 01:37:09.573
What do you say we
hit some balls?

01:37:09.657 --> 01:37:11.533
I can introduce
you to the team.

01:37:11.618 --> 01:37:13.118
All right, let's go.

01:37:13.203 --> 01:37:14.786
Good idea. Get out of here.

01:37:41.439 --> 01:37:43.482
Batter up, you little sissy.

01:37:46.569 --> 01:37:48.904
Get your hands
together on the bat.

01:37:53.117 --> 01:37:54.576
Stand in the box.

01:38:24.357 --> 01:38:26.024
Five minutes.

01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:28.569
Cory Brand.

01:38:28.653 --> 01:38:30.737
This boy belong to you?

01:38:30.822 --> 01:38:32.322
Let me call you right back.

01:38:32.407 --> 01:38:35.325
He sure does. What's up, buddy?
Huh?

01:38:35.410 --> 01:38:37.452
I'm sorry we missed your game.

01:38:37.537 --> 01:38:39.746
How have you been? Good.

01:38:42.250 --> 01:38:44.001
Hi. Hey.

01:38:45.545 --> 01:38:46.837
How you been?

01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:48.839
Good.

01:38:50.341 --> 01:38:52.092
You look good.

01:38:52.176 --> 01:38:53.802
Thanks.

01:38:55.138 --> 01:38:56.680
So great to see you, guys.

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:58.932
You look great.

01:38:59.017 --> 01:39:00.559
Thank you.

01:39:00.643 --> 01:39:02.352
You guys have some time?

01:39:02.437 --> 01:39:04.313
Yes, please. Please,
please, please.

01:39:04.397 --> 01:39:06.023
Yes, we do.

01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:08.692
You want to see the field?
Yeah.

01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:10.319
Huh?

01:39:15.241 --> 01:39:16.742
So, what do you think?

01:39:16.826 --> 01:39:18.744
Can you pop one
over that fence?

01:39:18.828 --> 01:39:20.787
No. Oh, I bet you could.

01:39:20.872 --> 01:39:21.955
No, I couldn't.

01:39:23.541 --> 01:39:25.042
One day.

01:39:25.126 --> 01:39:26.627
How is Coach Clay
treating you guys?

01:39:26.711 --> 01:39:29.504
Good. Yeah?

01:39:29.631 --> 01:39:31.340
You guys beat the Roughnecks?
Yeah.

01:39:31.424 --> 01:39:33.508
That's what I'm talking about.

01:39:33.635 --> 01:39:36.928
Coach Pajersky wasn't really happy.
I bet he wasn't.

01:39:41.434 --> 01:39:45.062
Time to go. Oh, come on, Mom.

01:39:45.146 --> 01:39:46.980
Come on, let's bring
it in, sport.

01:39:53.571 --> 01:39:55.822
Hey, Tyler, come here.
What is it?

01:39:55.907 --> 01:39:57.157
I got something for you.

01:40:02.372 --> 01:40:03.664
You sure you want me to have it?

01:40:04.916 --> 01:40:06.333
Belongs to you now.

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:17.928
Emma.

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:19.596
Thanks for coming.

01:40:19.681 --> 01:40:22.015
Sure.

01:40:24.852 --> 01:40:26.645
Hey, listen, there's, uh...

01:40:29.565 --> 01:40:34.194
There's nothing I can do to
make up for what I've done.

01:40:34.278 --> 01:40:36.113
For what I put you through.

01:40:37.657 --> 01:40:39.199
And Tyler.

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:43.286
I'm sorry.

01:40:43.371 --> 01:40:46.748
I'm so, so sorry, Emma.

01:40:46.833 --> 01:40:48.625
And I hope you can forgive me.

01:40:50.503 --> 01:40:51.712
Listen, I'm...

01:40:53.548 --> 01:40:55.424
I'm not asking for
anything, okay?

01:40:55.508 --> 01:40:57.634
But,

01:40:57.719 --> 01:40:59.720
I want you to know I
love this family.

01:41:01.973 --> 01:41:05.350
I believe in this family and I
want to be a part of it as much

01:41:07.437 --> 01:41:09.938
or as little as
you'll let me be.

01:41:18.072 --> 01:41:19.531
Yeah.

01:41:34.005 --> 01:41:35.589
Mom? Hm?

01:41:35.673 --> 01:41:39.050
Nothing great happens
when you hold back.

01:41:50.897 --> 01:41:52.272
Cory.

01:42:19.759 --> 01:42:21.092
You hungry?

01:42:21.177 --> 01:42:23.303
Yeah.

01:42:25.473 --> 01:42:26.807
Let's go.

01:42:45.076 --> 01:42:49.496
I have left The battle lines.

01:42:52.166 --> 01:42:54.292
There's a hope.

01:42:54.377 --> 01:42:58.171
That lies In front of me

01:43:02.343 --> 01:43:06.930
I've discovered Who I am.

01:43:09.392 --> 01:43:13.812
And I found I was.

01:43:13.896 --> 01:43:16.189
The enemy

01:43:17.733 --> 01:43:20.902
I have struggled.

01:43:20.987 --> 01:43:24.030
For so long

01:43:25.616 --> 01:43:27.909
I lay it down

01:43:30.037 --> 01:43:32.163
I give it up

01:43:34.375 --> 01:43:36.710
I'm letting go.

01:43:39.046 --> 01:43:42.883
Of this war I've always known

01:43:42.967 --> 01:43:45.051
I wave the flag

01:43:47.179 --> 01:43:51.308
I humbly fall.

01:43:51.392 --> 01:43:53.894
On my knees

01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:59.816
I have tried To do it all.

01:43:59.901 --> 01:44:03.153
On my own

01:44:08.951 --> 01:44:11.745
I surrender

01:44:32.892 --> 01:44:35.602
I've used alcohol my entire life

01:44:37.605 --> 01:44:39.773
to replace the
love and attention

01:44:39.857 --> 01:44:42.692
I never received
from my father.

01:44:45.863 --> 01:44:49.783
But every drop of
alcohol, every drop,

01:44:51.077 --> 01:44:53.453
every one night stand,

01:44:55.539 --> 01:44:59.542
would never replace the
ache inside of me.

01:44:59.627 --> 01:45:01.753
An ache that only
God could fill.

01:45:03.297 --> 01:45:05.131
I tried to change.

01:45:08.636 --> 01:45:11.680
But I failed everytime.

01:45:11.764 --> 01:45:15.100
And I know now that I'm
powerless without God.

01:45:15.184 --> 01:45:18.103
But with his help,

01:45:18.187 --> 01:45:21.189
I found a freedom from
my pain and my habits

01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:26.152
that I never thought
was possible.

01:45:28.322 --> 01:45:31.700
My family has suffered
for generations.

01:45:31.784 --> 01:45:35.495
And I suffered because
of my father's pain.

01:45:35.579 --> 01:45:39.040
And my father suffered because
of his father's pain.

01:45:44.005 --> 01:45:46.339
But this is how it changes.

01:45:46.424 --> 01:45:50.010
This is where it changes.

01:45:50.094 --> 01:45:53.346
And today I begin a new story.

01:45:55.099 --> 01:45:57.809
I'm a child of God.

01:45:57.893 --> 01:46:00.186
