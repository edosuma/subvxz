00:27.244 --> 00:30.204
This planet is more
unforgiving than my own.

00:30.247 --> 00:32.597
I have no friends, no home,

00:32.641 --> 00:34.512
and very much of the hunger.

00:42.564 --> 00:43.826
I mustn't.

00:43.869 --> 00:46.655
Cats are sweet, but not to eat.

00:46.698 --> 00:48.222
Yo, Star.

00:48.265 --> 00:51.138
Could it be my wise-cracking,
TV alien friend?

00:51.181 --> 00:55.055
Go ahead. Eat it.
No one's gonna miss just one cat.

00:55.098 --> 00:57.970
One plump, juicy, delicious cat.

01:01.931 --> 01:03.367
Robin?

01:05.152 --> 01:07.328
You were living
amongst the rats and filth?

01:07.371 --> 01:09.156
You betcha.

01:09.199 --> 01:11.375
Kid Flash took the team
and voted me out.

01:11.419 --> 01:12.942
He took the tower too.

01:12.985 --> 01:15.423
The Flash child stole
the team and the home?

01:15.466 --> 01:19.166
That's no big deal.
I found this spot and it's just dandy.

01:20.732 --> 01:22.430
Gosh. What are you
doing here, Raven?

01:22.473 --> 01:25.389
Well, my dad kicked me out for
not enslaving the universe.

01:25.433 --> 01:27.348
So, now I have to
live on the streets.

01:27.391 --> 01:28.784
Just like Robin.

01:28.827 --> 01:31.091
Kicked off your own team?

01:31.134 --> 01:33.180
Brutal.

01:33.223 --> 01:35.878
It's really not a big deal.
Kinda wish people would stop talking about it.

01:35.921 --> 01:38.272
Y'all got any trash to eat
or live in?

01:38.315 --> 01:40.317
He's on hard times, yo.

01:40.361 --> 01:41.623
Hey, it's no-pants guy.

01:41.666 --> 01:44.278
Why ain't you in
your fancy new tower, huh?

01:44.321 --> 01:47.324
Did Kid Flash steal it along
with the team or something?

01:47.368 --> 01:49.021
Yes, and I'm fine with it.

01:49.065 --> 01:50.632
You ains't look fine with it.

01:52.634 --> 01:54.375
He is not fine with it.

01:54.418 --> 01:55.811
Gee...

01:57.160 --> 01:58.379
...willikers!

01:58.422 --> 02:00.990
And this is all your fault.

02:01.033 --> 02:03.210
If you guys didn't
get me so worked up.

02:03.253 --> 02:05.647
Well, at least when you get all
worked up, you're not a push-over.

02:05.690 --> 02:07.736
Maybe, if you was
always worked up,

02:07.779 --> 02:10.391
you wouldn't have gotten
kicked off your own team.

02:10.434 --> 02:12.480
Getting worked up
is what got me kicked off.

02:12.523 --> 02:14.308
Hey, we got kicked
off the team too.

02:14.351 --> 02:16.440
So, we's all rejects.

02:16.484 --> 02:20.401
Yos, I just had an idea.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.142
We should be a team.

02:22.185 --> 02:25.884
A team of rejects?
Outsiders? Underdogs? I'm in.

02:25.928 --> 02:29.061
I am also the in with
the outside underdogs.

02:29.105 --> 02:32.369
This will really annoy
my dad. I'm in.

02:32.413 --> 02:33.544
Uh, thanks but no thanks.

02:33.588 --> 02:35.285
You four bring out
the worst in me

02:35.329 --> 02:36.895
You are the welcome.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.723
It is not a good thing.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.335
But the regular you be letting
Kid Flash live up in your tower.

02:41.378 --> 02:44.164
But the five of us together
would never let that happen.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.470
Come on, Robin.
We're getting your tower back.

02:53.129 --> 02:54.130
Ugh.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.307
Gee, whiz.
We shouldn't be here.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.831
Kid Flash will flip his lid
if he catches us.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.790
This is your tower, remember?

03:01.833 --> 03:03.444
You guys?

03:03.487 --> 03:05.315
Whatever this is about,
I don't have time for it.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.970
Somebody flushed some wet
wipes and backed up the toilet.

03:08.013 --> 03:09.972
The package said
they were flushable.

03:10.015 --> 03:12.757
You stole this man's home
and clogged the plumbing?

03:12.801 --> 03:16.239
Our leader Robin has the
something to say to the you.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.936
Oh, I do?
I... I... Yes.

03:17.980 --> 03:20.156
I just wanted to
apologize for trespassing.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.853
Yeah, that's right,
flash-in-a-pan.

03:21.897 --> 03:24.247
- We callings you out, fool.
- No, we're not.

03:24.291 --> 03:28.120
- Robin has had the enough of your push-arounds.
- No, I haven't.

03:28.164 --> 03:30.253
And he's no longer the wimp
he used to be.

03:30.297 --> 03:33.430
- Yes, I am.
- This sounds like a challenge.

03:33.474 --> 03:34.953
Your team versus our team.

03:34.997 --> 03:36.259
The winners get the tower.

03:36.303 --> 03:40.002
And the losers gots to
leave Jump City, yo.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.395
I do not agree with these terms.

03:41.438 --> 03:43.223
Oh, that is so a deal.

03:43.266 --> 03:46.356
Say goodbye to
Jump City, losers.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.315
Gee, whiz, gang.
What are you doing?

03:48.358 --> 03:49.794
We can't win against them.

03:49.838 --> 03:51.274
They already
beat you in try-outs.

03:51.318 --> 03:53.450
That was before
we had you as our leader.

03:53.494 --> 03:56.192
But Kid Flash is right.
I'm not a leader.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.976
Then we're just gonna
have to make you one.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.588
And our first step, get
you out of those clothes.

04:07.116 --> 04:10.032
Dang, they really went to town with the wet wipes.

04:10.815 --> 04:12.469
Hey. Get out of my bathroom.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.079
This isn't your bathroom.

04:14.123 --> 04:16.256
You best be doing
a pee-pee dance, fool.

04:16.299 --> 04:18.388
'Cause you're gonna be
holding it for a minute.

04:18.432 --> 04:20.564
Now, let's start with
the biggest problem area.

04:20.608 --> 04:21.957
Give the man some pants.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.873
Azarath Metrion Zinthos!

04:24.916 --> 04:26.831
And lose them
little elf booties.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.269
I wants to see some
stomping boots, yo.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.836
Sick.

04:32.924 --> 04:35.884
And the cape must
cover the posterior.

04:35.927 --> 04:37.668
Oh, much the better.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.627
Now to do something
about that hair.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.675
- Now that's what's up, dude.
- Oh, yeah!

04:44.719 --> 04:45.763
Much more the appealing.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.591
Are you guys pulling my leg?

04:47.635 --> 04:49.332
I've got hedgehog hair

04:49.376 --> 04:52.117
and my thighs are already
hot from all this fabric.

04:52.161 --> 04:53.815
New clothes won't make him a leader.
Nothing will.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.382
Now, get out so I can pee.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.471
Oh, who are we kidding.
He's right.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.473
I'm too much of a wimp.

04:59.516 --> 05:02.563
Maybe you're right.
You did just let him take your team, after all.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.347
You don't have to rub it in.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.393
Only a wimp would let someone
kick them out of their own home.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.438
That's enough, guys.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.658
And don't forget. He lets that fool
flush them wet wipes down his pipes.

05:10.701 --> 05:12.355
Those are my wet wipes!

05:12.399 --> 05:15.619
And there is no such thing
as a flushable wipe.

05:15.663 --> 05:17.578
Even if it says so
on the package.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.623
Everyone knows that.

05:19.667 --> 05:22.365
The voice. So commanding!

05:24.411 --> 05:26.674
I'll follow that voice anywhere.

05:28.980 --> 05:31.418
You guys really do bring out
the worst in me.

05:31.461 --> 05:33.158
And I like it.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.203
First off,

05:34.246 --> 05:37.511
we are the Teen Titans,
not them.

05:37.554 --> 05:38.512
Sir, yes, sir.

05:38.555 --> 05:40.992
And we are gonna destroy them.

05:41.036 --> 05:42.603
Sir, yes, sir.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.518
And how are we gonna do it?

05:44.561 --> 05:46.346
Any way we can.

05:47.259 --> 05:48.739
Titans, go!

05:50.959 --> 05:52.830
Hi, thanks for coming.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.876
Okay. So, like the try-outs, this
challenge will consist of combat,

05:54.919 --> 05:57.052
problem solving
and if we need a tie-breaker,

05:57.444 --> 05:58.836
speed.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.970
Ooh, he stole your try-outs too?

06:02.013 --> 06:04.102
Yes, but like everything else,
I made them better.

06:04.146 --> 06:06.322
So, let's start with combat.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.411
This is not your usual
combat dummy.

06:08.455 --> 06:09.804
This one fights back.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.576
Come on, Victor.
We're all counting on you.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.578
I don't know, coach.
That thing looks tough.

06:44.621 --> 06:47.972
You wanted to be a superhero.
Well, this is your chance.

06:48.016 --> 06:49.496
It's gonna destroy me.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.628
You said you trusted me
as a leader, right?

06:51.672 --> 06:54.457
Well, I promise you, at the end
of this, no matter what happens,

06:54.501 --> 06:57.025
you will be a true superhero.

06:57.068 --> 06:59.506
Okay. Let's do this.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.561
Yo, time out. Victor's hurt.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.260
Why did I let you
talk me into this?

07:15.304 --> 07:17.480
Yeah. That's
a disqualification.

07:17.524 --> 07:20.396
No, no. He's not done. We're just gonna
pop over to the hospital real quick.

07:26.054 --> 07:27.403
Hey, chumps.

07:37.587 --> 07:38.632
Victor?

07:38.675 --> 07:40.590
The name's Cyborg now,

07:40.634 --> 07:43.332
'cause the doctors had to replace my
broken body parts with robot parts.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.899
- That's cheating.
- Too bad.

07:44.942 --> 07:47.031
Time in!

07:57.651 --> 07:59.566
Dabba-de-doo!

07:59.609 --> 08:01.655
Yes, short-circuited.

08:04.832 --> 08:08.879
Next challenge is a puzzle.
Only if you can't solve it.

08:08.923 --> 08:12.492
I got this. It's not like
it's gonna explode in my face.

08:13.797 --> 08:16.670
Ow! Ow! Oh, my eye!

08:16.713 --> 08:18.585
That was easy.

08:18.628 --> 08:21.501
It all comes down to
the tiebreaker for the tower.

08:21.544 --> 08:24.416
Which, unfortunately for you,
is the speed challenge.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.157
A foot race around the world.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.638
- No problem.
- Are you serious? Is he serious?

08:28.682 --> 08:31.598
Oh, but...
Oh, he's serious. Okay...

08:31.641 --> 08:34.470
Oh. Oh,
you'll just so never beat me.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.951
We'll see about that, Kid Trash.

08:38.474 --> 08:39.823
In your face!

08:39.867 --> 08:43.435
Oh, boy. Okay.
Yeah, this will be fun.

08:48.919 --> 08:51.792
Titans, quick. To the tower. Lock 'em out.

08:54.664 --> 08:56.361
Yes!

08:58.625 --> 09:00.104
Nice try.

09:00.148 --> 09:02.759
- You really are fast.
- Told you, I couldn't be beat.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.805
I guess not.

09:04.848 --> 09:08.069
And while the old me would have
conceded the tower to you like a gentleman,

09:08.678 --> 09:10.680
this is the new me.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.856
No, no, no.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.822
That hurt so much.

09:21.865 --> 09:24.955
Titans, take out the trash.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.915
No, no, no.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.134
So much longer of a drop
than I thought.

09:31.788 --> 09:34.443
Now get out of the city
and never come back.

09:34.486 --> 09:37.620
- Wow. What a ruthless leader.
- Come on, guys.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.579
We're going to the East Coast.

09:39.622 --> 09:42.843
And that's the flashback, dude.

09:42.886 --> 09:45.802
Wow. What a wonderful story
about how you turned me

09:45.846 --> 09:49.284
from the All-American Boy Wonder
into a raging control freak.

09:49.327 --> 09:51.199
It's true.
We bring out your worst.

09:51.242 --> 09:53.418
But your worst
brings out our best.

09:53.462 --> 09:56.291
And we can never thank you
enough for that.

09:56.334 --> 09:59.686
Oh, golly, uh, I didn't know
you felt that way, gang.

10:00.991 --> 10:02.558
He said "golly."

10:04.691 --> 10:06.127
Stop that. Stop that.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.129
You will not mock me.
I am your leader.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.131
Your leader! Silence!

10:10.174 --> 10:11.872
Stop it!
