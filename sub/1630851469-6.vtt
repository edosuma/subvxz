WEBVTT

00:09.240 --> 00:10.640
What shall we drink to?

00:10.720 --> 00:11.760
Red spider.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.160
Red spider.

00:13.240 --> 00:16.280
Four bedrooms. You could
sign off on this before you quit.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.720
What does Redback mean?

00:17.800 --> 00:20.600
You want to know?
Call the estate agent. Make an offer.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.520
You're planting a live bomb
in a crowded pub.

00:23.600 --> 00:24.880
It won't be live.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.280
We don't have to lose.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.160
How?

00:27.240 --> 00:29.840
Theoretically, the voting system
could be hacked.

00:29.920 --> 00:32.760
I think what you just said
could put you in prison.

00:32.840 --> 00:35.200
We've planted a bomb
in The Skanda pub.

00:40.160 --> 00:41.320
Kelvin, get fucking in!

00:41.400 --> 00:42.400
The bomb went off.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.680
This is on you.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.200
What happened? We just got here.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.360
I can't tell you anything.

00:47.440 --> 00:50.520
I killed them.
I killed all those people.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.960
<i>And there was a girl in there.</i>
<i>She smiled at me.</i>

00:54.040 --> 00:55.040
No!

00:55.760 --> 00:57.240
Something's odd?

00:57.320 --> 01:00.040
Yes. It's the rubber seal
that holds the shot tube.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.720
Why is there two?

01:01.800 --> 01:03.440
<i>I know who betrayed me.</i>

01:06.200 --> 01:07.800
<i>Who betrayed you?</i>

01:13.720 --> 01:15.520
Beatrice, you made it!

01:16.080 --> 01:17.600
You're not dressed
for dinner, though.

01:17.680 --> 01:20.720
Well, I'm technically still at work.
I need to eat and run.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.480
Yeah. All right.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.560
Well...

01:25.200 --> 01:27.160
It won't take long.
We're just in here.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.080
-Beatrice.
-Beatrice.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.680
What's this? The 00 Supper Club?

01:42.000 --> 01:42.880
Welcome.

01:42.960 --> 01:44.840
-Cheers.
-Welcome.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.000
Well, I really can't stay long.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.400
Just one drink. Come on.

01:48.480 --> 01:51.200
Come on, Beatrice! One for the road.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.960
-Just one. Welcome.
-Thanks.

01:53.600 --> 01:54.680
New blood.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.160
-Hear, hear.
-Cheers.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.040
Welcome, Beatrice.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.600
I thought we'd done
with Alexander Kutiev.

03:41.680 --> 03:46.080
No one can spend this long
researching Hoovers.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.240
Yeah, I didn't sign up for this.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.320
Here you go.

03:49.800 --> 03:50.760
Keys.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.840
For the invisible spy car
you signed up to drive.

03:54.680 --> 03:55.560
What have you got?

03:56.160 --> 03:59.400
We've been over
Kutiev's online comms. Twice.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.560
Maybe he was bluffing about Redback.

04:01.640 --> 04:02.880
To get a swank house.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.320
Then why did Adamov kill him?

04:05.680 --> 04:07.560
-Anything you find...
-Run it by William.

04:29.240 --> 04:32.920
The coroner forged the report
from the bombing.

04:35.040 --> 04:37.720
I'm in his office looking at it.

04:38.120 --> 04:41.320
Two types of explosives,
Amatex and Amatol.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.480
Beatrice, maybe.

04:46.640 --> 04:49.400
I don't think Temple Laird
killed himself.

04:50.320 --> 04:53.960
Yes, but I know
how to get under her skin.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.320
Hello.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.840
Is it more retro porn?

05:04.920 --> 05:07.200
It's a dating website.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.440
Check Kutiev's username.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.080
-What is it?
-Mighty Lancer.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.680
He went to private message.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.000
If we can get into the server...

05:19.280 --> 05:21.440
And we have hit the mother lode!

05:21.920 --> 05:25.200
Endless cringe with Zara.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.880
Artificially generated cringe.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.920
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
Back, back, back, back, back!

05:32.000 --> 05:34.640
"Redback." Who is it?

05:35.320 --> 05:36.320
Buried treasure.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.880
This is what we signed up for.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.120
Hey.

06:01.720 --> 06:02.720
What's going on?

06:03.400 --> 06:06.000
Marcus and Declan have had
a breakthrough on a dating website.

06:06.680 --> 06:07.480
Yeah?

06:09.840 --> 06:13.400
Fuck! This machine!
It's worse than the old one.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.640
I ask for hot water,
it gives me coffee.

06:15.720 --> 06:16.920
Come on, I'm pregnant.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.120
What?

06:24.640 --> 06:26.360
Have you ever been pregnant?

06:31.440 --> 06:32.520
You two.

06:36.920 --> 06:40.360
Kutiev accessed
this dating site over 70 times.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.240
Username: Mighty Lancer.

06:42.840 --> 06:45.120
He only ever interacted with a Zara.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.520
I hacked their private messages.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.080
I hope you cleaned
your desk afterwards.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.560
Declan spotted it.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.040
What, this is your evidence?

06:51.120 --> 06:54.200
This is an indication
that Redback is an individual.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.720
Perhaps someone close to the PM...

06:55.800 --> 06:59.800
No, no. Redback is the code name
for a terror attack on British soil.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.320
Or an attack coordinated by Redback.

07:02.400 --> 07:03.400
Who is it?

07:03.880 --> 07:05.960
We're really going to let this
dictate our strategy?

07:06.880 --> 07:10.480
Do we have a log-in location
for this Zara?

07:10.560 --> 07:12.040
Zara spoofed the IP address.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.600
We're working
on the VPN relay points now.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.720
Excellent work. Thank you.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.240
Thanks, everyone.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.760
Keep at it. No diversions.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.040
You heard him.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.680
They didn't even ask themselves
if it was a plant.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.040
Anybody wanna know
how I can spoof an IP address?

07:35.120 --> 07:36.600
Their strategy's a leap backwards.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.200
Further away
from where we need to be.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.000
Further away from Torben?

07:42.840 --> 07:44.240
That...

07:44.800 --> 07:46.520
Gavriil Sergov...

07:46.600 --> 07:47.600
Yeah?

07:48.160 --> 07:50.160
DSAs have picked something up.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.160
Your father knows him.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.680
In what capacity?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.480
That's all I have. Sorry.

08:03.800 --> 08:07.080
Was it William that suggested
you should get rid of it?

08:08.160 --> 08:09.560
Get rid of what?

08:09.640 --> 08:11.280
Of the pregnancy.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.760
No, of course not.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.080
No, I couldn't even...
It... It wasn't the right time.

08:22.360 --> 08:23.640
I was 22.

08:24.360 --> 08:27.280
You know, the job. I...
I wasn't gonna have a baby.

08:27.360 --> 08:28.640
Never will.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.240
You don't think you're capable?

08:33.080 --> 08:34.480
Some people just aren't.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.360
Come.

08:59.240 --> 09:02.560
Katrine said you know him.
Gavriil Sergov.

09:05.440 --> 09:08.120
Everyone knows
Gavriil Sergov, darling.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.960
We bump into each other
at the Crimea Club.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.920
If our paths cross,
he asks me how I am and I tell him.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.320
And then I ask him how he is,

09:18.400 --> 09:21.080
and he tells me about his gout
or some other medieval ailment.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.120
So, tell Miss Poulsen,

09:26.200 --> 09:29.000
when I say no diversions,
I mean no diversions.

09:42.160 --> 09:46.680
I want to know why you're not
looking for the guy I saw.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.400
Sorry, Miss Vilfort. We have.

09:49.480 --> 09:53.560
He walked into The Skanda pub.
He left just before the bomb.

09:53.640 --> 09:56.720
This guy was inside
for, like, two minutes.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.000
That doesn't appear strange to you?

09:59.080 --> 10:01.120
We've taken 22 witness statements.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.120
Nobody else saw this individual.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.880
I spoke to him!

10:09.280 --> 10:13.640
We understand you sustained
concussion in the blast.

10:13.720 --> 10:16.760
You're still undergoing treatment
for your symptoms.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.160
Nausea, dizziness...

10:19.240 --> 10:21.080
I didn't imagine him!

10:21.160 --> 10:23.600
Miss Vilfort, the individual
responsible for the bomb...

10:23.680 --> 10:28.160
Laird isn't the man I saw
and you can't make me say he is!

10:30.840 --> 10:31.960
<i>Adam?</i>

10:32.440 --> 10:33.280
Yeah?

10:33.360 --> 10:35.040
I just had a message from Holly.

10:35.720 --> 10:38.400
Someone she knows died in that bomb.

10:39.720 --> 10:40.520
What?

10:40.600 --> 10:42.720
Well, a friend of a friend.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.800
But she's going to the funeral.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.600
Well, she'll...
She'll wanna come with us.

10:48.680 --> 10:49.520
-Hold on...
-No, no.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.400
First, her mother died. And now this.

10:51.480 --> 10:54.720
Can we, for once, not rush at things?

10:54.800 --> 10:56.960
Hey, think about everything
that you've been through.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.840
That you're still in the middle of.

10:58.920 --> 11:01.800
Besides everything else,
the press will be out in force.

11:01.880 --> 11:03.240
Yeah, well,
they won't know who she is.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.120
Well, it doesn't take a lot
to join the dots.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.960
And what happens if she isn't yours?

11:17.200 --> 11:18.160
Hi.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.440
I just heard from Etta what happened.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.640
I'm so sorry.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.120
Thanks.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.520
I'm okay.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.080
Yeah, but one of your friends.
It's just awful.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.440
<i>I thought I should let you know,</i>
<i>that's all.</i>

11:34.200 --> 11:36.680
Well, we should probably discuss
how we manage it.

11:37.720 --> 11:38.760
The funeral, I mean.

11:39.680 --> 11:40.600
I didn't...

11:40.680 --> 11:44.280
I didn't mean I'd come with you.
I'm only going to support Ava.

11:46.560 --> 11:49.720
Why don't you come with us?
I'll arrange it.

11:54.960 --> 11:59.520
What would you say to people?
We haven't even had the DNA results.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.680
<i>And I'd prefer to go with Ava.</i>

12:03.200 --> 12:05.080
Sorry, Adam.
Someone's trying to get through.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.880
No, no. Of course. You go.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.120
But just let us know
if you need anything.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.440
Sure. Bye, then.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.960
Excuse me. Would you mind
taking a photograph?

12:53.040 --> 12:54.120
Sure.

12:55.680 --> 12:56.800
All these!

13:01.040 --> 13:02.080
Thank you.

13:02.920 --> 13:03.960
Were you tailed?

13:04.040 --> 13:05.080
We're safe here.

13:05.520 --> 13:09.080
Tyana, go play for a while, OK?
Mummy will be back soon.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.280
Jelena, she's gorgeous.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.000
How old is she?

13:18.080 --> 13:19.280
She's almost five.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.080
So, you were pregnant
last time I saw you?

13:23.160 --> 13:23.960
Yeah.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.520
You're too thin, darling.
What are they doing to you?

13:29.280 --> 13:30.680
They make me work!

13:30.760 --> 13:33.480
Swines. I'll send you cake.
Russian honey cake...

13:33.560 --> 13:34.840
-Oh, yes!
-...moist with Malibu.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.400
They won't let you
get it through customs.

13:36.480 --> 13:37.920
I'll hide it in microfilm.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.760
It is so good to see you.

13:41.840 --> 13:43.840
Ah, I wanted a holiday.

13:43.920 --> 13:47.120
And Tianna was very keen
to see the Salisbury Cathedral.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.320
Also, I have information.

13:51.720 --> 13:52.760
Right.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.160
Come on. I could have
got that to you 100 ways.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.560
I wanted to see you.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.320
Sorry. It's my boss.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.000
Hello.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.800
Smistoff och Mnuchin?

14:17.240 --> 14:20.400
Smistoff and Mnuchin
are Copenhagen-based, aren't they?

14:20.880 --> 14:23.920
My boss wants a body moved
and he wants deniability.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.880
Okay. When you get those coordinates,
can you send them to me?

14:26.960 --> 14:29.080
You think it's Torben Jensen? No.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.000
This is my information.

14:31.080 --> 14:34.040
Our intel
has Torben Jensen in London.

14:34.680 --> 14:37.080
He's in contact
with the bias link to Daesh.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.280
I'm gonna have to call this in.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.120
Tianna!

14:44.640 --> 14:45.680
Tianna!

14:48.040 --> 14:49.240
That's all I've got.

14:49.320 --> 14:53.120
My contact will be in touch
if and when an action is imminent.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.080
I promised Tianna we'd go to the zoo.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.520
Can I come?

15:00.600 --> 15:01.840
No, I'm only joking.

15:05.320 --> 15:07.160
This is the life we've chosen.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.400
Tyana, wave good-bye.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.040
Bye.

15:42.880 --> 15:43.800
Yes?

15:43.880 --> 15:46.080
I'm preparing spatchcock poussin.

15:46.160 --> 15:48.440
Inviting the team over
for a working lunch.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.760
<i>I'm part of the team?</i>

15:50.840 --> 15:52.600
You're not a vegan
or anything, are you?

15:52.680 --> 15:55.960
No. I was actually just about
to get a ham sandwich.

15:56.040 --> 15:59.440
I'll send the address over. 1:30.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.080
Ogilvy just invited me over.

16:12.680 --> 16:16.680
I'll mention it and see
how he reacts. Yeah?

16:18.160 --> 16:22.240
We all have something that
betrays us, even William Ogilvy.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.120
Allright.

16:28.200 --> 16:32.200
<i>Noomi, I understand your brother</i>
<i>worked in The Skanda pub.</i>

16:32.280 --> 16:34.840
<i>Yeah. Um, Niels was a chef.</i>

16:35.560 --> 16:38.040
<i>He'd just started working there.</i>

16:39.520 --> 16:41.120
<i>It's very hard.</i>

16:41.760 --> 16:45.640
<i>Especially as no one</i>
<i>seems interested</i>

16:45.720 --> 16:47.760
<i>in what really happened</i>
<i>to my brother.</i>

16:48.800 --> 16:51.920
<i>Noomi, thank you for sharing</i>
<i>your tragic story.</i>

17:11.680 --> 17:14.960
<i>Especially as no one</i>
<i>seems interested</i>

17:15.040 --> 17:17.000
<i>in what really happened</i>
<i>to my brother.</i>

17:19.320 --> 17:20.360
Great.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.840
At 2:00 p.m. you have
the first of the funerals.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.200
This one for victim Hannah Moya.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.600
-Security as low-key as possible.
-Is that wise?

17:27.680 --> 17:30.120
The terror threat, where it is.
Low-key is going to be...

17:30.200 --> 17:31.880
There are some funerals
before Hannah Moya.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.520
The Jedburgh Free Baptist Church.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.320
There was an issue.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.520
A few of the families
didn't want you there.

17:40.600 --> 17:41.560
How many?

17:41.640 --> 17:42.880
Six.

17:43.640 --> 17:47.240
That's five that will have you.
It's not too shabby.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.360
And what about
the Niels Vilfort funeral?

17:51.800 --> 17:53.240
No instructions either way
on that one.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.480
Maybe the family
just wanted some privacy.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.240
Just go to the five
that won't kick you out.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.960
It'll demonstrate empathy.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.080
You were opposed to this.

18:05.720 --> 18:06.880
I slept on it.

18:06.960 --> 18:10.040
And it's actually going to play
brilliantly with the No vote.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.080
It's true. The poll indicated
a lot of support.

18:12.160 --> 18:15.000
I'm not trying to score
political capital here.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.680
I simply want to pay my respects.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.920
Exactly. I mean,
it'll be very moving.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.440
We will ensure the reporters
keep a respectful distance.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.200
Do you think we can keep them out?

18:25.280 --> 18:26.160
We can try.

18:26.240 --> 18:28.680
This is completely unfair
on the families!

18:33.600 --> 18:35.400
I'll go to the bomb site instead.

18:35.480 --> 18:36.640
One visit.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.320
I won't turn these people's grief
into a circus.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.040
Okay.

18:58.120 --> 19:01.000
So, say, you contact Noomi Vilfort.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.560
What do you say to her?

19:07.720 --> 19:09.320
You haven't thought this through.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.000
I fucked up, that's what I tell her.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.400
I don't know how.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.160
Exactly! You don't know how!

19:16.240 --> 19:19.760
And I didn't mean to, all right,
but I killed her brother.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.600
And ten other people.

19:22.680 --> 19:25.200
The police have their version,
all right? Laird planted the bomb.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.960
Laird killed himself. Case closed.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.760
No, that's a fat fucking lie!

19:28.840 --> 19:30.640
The truth is we don't fucking know
what happened,

19:30.720 --> 19:32.320
so how is that gonna help
this young woman?

19:34.720 --> 19:37.960
No, you... you only care
about yourself.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.520
I sacrificed every fucking principle
I have to protect you,

19:40.600 --> 19:41.880
so don't fucking go there.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.040
I took out Laird
to save you a public enquiry.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.280
You fucking did that
to save your own skin!

19:46.800 --> 19:49.120
And those deaths,
they are on both of us.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.000
I fucking should've let you die.

19:56.640 --> 19:57.880
Who are you?

20:03.440 --> 20:05.240
He doesn't leave this room
unaccompanied.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.600
Fuck!

20:17.800 --> 20:19.120
What do you think this means?

20:20.040 --> 20:22.600
"If we'd have gone to Skanda
half an hour earlier..."

20:23.080 --> 20:24.760
She was gonna be at that pub.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.960
Why didn't she tell us?

20:27.920 --> 20:30.040
Call her when you get to Scotland.

20:36.640 --> 20:39.600
No, he won't be
taking questions afterwards, no.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.000
It never stops, does it?

20:42.960 --> 20:45.360
I had a strategy
with Adam and Zac at uni.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.720
We'd always argue
about which bars to go to.

20:47.800 --> 20:50.600
I didn't like the uni bar.
Too many students for me.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.920
But Adam and Zac, well,
they loved it, of course. Cheap beer.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.480
So, I spent the entire time
convincing them

20:56.560 --> 20:59.920
that the lovely little pub in town
was actually their idea all along.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.520
Good tactic.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.960
It's a strategy that women
have deployed for ever.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.000
Am I right?

21:05.480 --> 21:07.120
I guess so, yeah.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.200
You didn't want Adam
to go to the funerals, did you?

21:10.640 --> 21:11.600
I did.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.520
Like I said, the poll's favorable.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.080
Well, don't get me wrong.
I'm grateful.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.880
I just wonder about your motivation.

21:17.960 --> 21:20.640
Etta, I think you're crediting me
with a lot more power

21:20.720 --> 21:22.280
than I actually have
over Zac and Adam.

21:22.360 --> 21:24.800
I know about tweaking
the referendum results.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.000
You got it all wrong.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.240
We joke about all sorts.

21:31.320 --> 21:35.080
Zac suggested nuking the Isle of Man.
It relieves the pressure.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.880
Okay. It was a joke.

23:08.160 --> 23:09.120
Nurse!

23:09.640 --> 23:11.120
Nurse!

23:29.640 --> 23:31.040
Gavriil Sergov.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.280
Found a number of these
in your cellar.

23:34.360 --> 23:36.480
Hit the jackpot in locker 442.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.760
Gavriil Sergov,

23:37.840 --> 23:40.200
you're under arrest on suspicion
of supplying class A drugs.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.600
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense

23:42.680 --> 23:44.600
if you do not mention,
when questioned, something...

23:44.680 --> 23:45.720
I'd like to make a call.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.960
There's nothing but dead ends!

23:54.040 --> 23:55.120
Bollocks!

23:56.440 --> 23:58.360
Zara's more intelligent
than she looks.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.640
That's gender stereotyping, Marcus.

24:03.600 --> 24:06.880
She used Tor, AKA the onion router.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.000
Declan speaking.

24:08.080 --> 24:11.240
U.S. Naval research lab toys.
Untraceable node routing.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.280
I know what Tor is, Marcus.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.760
Levi? Beatrice.

24:16.720 --> 24:17.960
Beatrice.

24:26.520 --> 24:27.560
It's open!

24:42.520 --> 24:43.360
Through here.

24:53.680 --> 24:55.480
-Hello.
-Hello!

24:57.440 --> 24:58.400
I'm early?

24:58.480 --> 25:01.400
No, you're exactly on time.
The others are a bit delayed.

25:01.880 --> 25:03.920
Is Beatrice coming?

25:04.000 --> 25:05.640
That's funny. That's what she asked.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.520
You haven't fallen out, have you?

25:08.080 --> 25:09.520
We're not kids.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.280
She doesn't make friends easily.

25:11.360 --> 25:14.080
It's interesting
that you've won her trust.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.320
Trust is a bit strong.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.360
Well, take your coat off.
You just passed the dining room.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.360
We're not waiting?

25:21.440 --> 25:22.920
Nah. Fuck 'em.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.320
Go through.

25:47.760 --> 25:50.400
Why would Sergov
call you in for a drugs raid?

25:50.480 --> 25:52.680
Must have hit it off
more than I thought.

25:52.760 --> 25:55.480
And he says he's got evidence
for my eyes only.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.240
This has to be you and me.

26:01.880 --> 26:05.360
I'm flattered, but this
is Levi Nichols, my section chief.

26:05.840 --> 26:08.120
He's less appealing
than your Danish friend.

26:09.840 --> 26:11.160
Why did you call?

26:13.120 --> 26:15.720
I have information
you're going to be interested in.

26:23.840 --> 26:27.520
I want all charges against myself
and my associates dropped.

26:28.360 --> 26:29.920
Why would we do that?

26:35.840 --> 26:40.280
-What shall we drink to?
-To the friendship of nations.

26:40.760 --> 26:45.160
And to the peaceful skies
above our heads.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.920
Red spider.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.840
Your father is working for Moscow.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.120
Who is Redback?

27:04.160 --> 27:06.640
Yeah. Anytime.

27:07.080 --> 27:07.880
Cheers.

27:10.240 --> 27:12.520
William left the office
a couple of hours ago.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.600
-You can't call him.
-Yes, I can.

27:14.680 --> 27:15.680
We need a search warrant,

27:15.760 --> 27:18.120
and authorization to bring him in
for voluntary questioning.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.520
The police forensics
can fine-tooth his home.

27:20.600 --> 27:21.720
We need to do this by the book.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.880
Sterile corridors, 'cause I need you
to be above suspicion.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.400
Levi, that video is not evidence.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.480
We don't know that. Drop the call.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.000
Drop the call.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.000
Let's go.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.360
Take a seat.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.960
What's up with this medieval shit?

27:49.920 --> 27:51.880
That's Gregorian chant.

27:52.520 --> 27:54.680
Tunes the mind to the alpha waves.

27:55.360 --> 27:59.200
Encourages a relaxed mental state.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.000
Behold the spatchcock.

28:11.680 --> 28:14.760
So, you see, we split the bird
down the middle.

28:15.880 --> 28:17.400
Flatten it out,

28:17.480 --> 28:18.760
put a skewer through.

28:19.520 --> 28:24.560
And season
with the herbs of Provence.

28:27.720 --> 28:29.960
There's no one else coming, is there?

29:01.880 --> 29:03.360
Thank you all for coming.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.080
Niels would have really
appreciated it.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.400
I...

29:11.400 --> 29:12.960
I wanted to say...

29:14.120 --> 29:17.000
I don't want darkness and hate
to have the last word.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.600
At Grandad's funeral, someone said

29:20.680 --> 29:24.560
that he'd lived at least five lives
in his 68 years.

29:25.920 --> 29:29.720
It seems to me that Niels was only
just beginning his second life.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.880
He had a new job and a girlfriend,

29:33.960 --> 29:35.640
a country that he loved.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.880
The last time I saw my brother,

29:43.000 --> 29:45.800
I, um, I nagged him
about the recycling,

29:45.880 --> 29:48.360
and he said to...

29:49.120 --> 29:52.920
He said, "Nooms, you don't have
to worry about me anymore."

29:54.360 --> 29:57.480
I don't know what to do
if I'm not worrying about Niels.

29:58.120 --> 30:00.440
I don't know who I am without him.

30:14.200 --> 30:16.200
I thought you weren't coming.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.520
It didn't feel right not being here.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.520
Why are you here?

30:23.400 --> 30:25.040
I'm... I'm so sorry.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.280
I didn't mean to upset you,
Miss Vilfort.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.720
Your loss must be unbearable.

30:34.960 --> 30:36.800
I'm just here to support my daughter.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.000
So...

30:49.320 --> 30:51.880
You're a clever woman, Katrine.
Game this for me.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.720
An officer has valuable intel.

30:56.840 --> 31:00.320
You have something to trade.
How do you begin negotiations?

31:01.840 --> 31:04.200
Probably talk
about torturing chickens.

31:07.480 --> 31:11.440
What if this officer
couldn't give up any valuable intel?

31:12.280 --> 31:13.760
Why would that be?

31:13.840 --> 31:15.800
Because she didn't have any.

31:16.600 --> 31:20.560
Well, that would be
a refusal to trade.

31:21.400 --> 31:23.840
Consequences would ensue.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.760
If she doesn't drown,
then she must be a witch.

31:34.480 --> 31:37.680
I have a rule in this house.
No phones at the table.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.080
Put it back.

31:45.160 --> 31:46.760
Pick up your knife and fork.

31:48.800 --> 31:49.960
Eating for two.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.320
From what I've understood,

31:56.000 --> 31:58.720
Niels sounded like
a remarkable young man.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.920
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

32:04.360 --> 32:06.680
Well, my heart goes out to you,
Miss Vilfort.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.880
You and everyone else
who's been scarred

32:09.960 --> 32:12.600
by this appalling tragedy.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.160
That's him.

32:25.040 --> 32:26.200
Halt!

32:26.280 --> 32:28.160
Stop! Don't move!

32:28.240 --> 32:29.320
Halt! Stop!

32:29.400 --> 32:31.920
Move it! Put your hands on your head!

32:33.840 --> 32:35.720
Stop moving!

32:38.000 --> 32:39.320
Put your hands of your head!

32:42.200 --> 32:44.080
Get down on the ground!

32:53.360 --> 32:54.880
Get down on the ground!

32:54.960 --> 32:56.280
On the ground!

32:59.360 --> 33:00.360
Stop moving!

33:00.440 --> 33:02.400
Halt! Stay where you are!

33:34.120 --> 33:37.240
Suspect down. Move!
Everybody move!

33:40.320 --> 33:41.640
All right.

33:42.600 --> 33:46.080
Let's imagine that this agent
is refusing to cooperate.

33:47.440 --> 33:48.640
How does one deal with that?

33:49.680 --> 33:52.720
Splatter her brains
across the Farrow & Ball wallpaper?

33:53.880 --> 33:55.640
That's quite a risk.

33:55.720 --> 33:56.600
I agree.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.640
Although as director of Strategy,

33:59.720 --> 34:02.640
one does have a number
of resources at one's disposal.

34:04.120 --> 34:08.880
An ex with a grudge could surface,
or a dangerous Russian.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.040
The agent in question
could simply disappear.

34:18.520 --> 34:21.520
I'm going to walk out of here.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.800
And we can forget
this lunch ever happened.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.640
Well, I didn't have you down
as reckless.

34:27.720 --> 34:30.720
Work could call me back to Denmark
and you'd never have to see me again.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.680
Now, you know
I can't allow that to happen.

34:40.320 --> 34:42.280
It's a pity to see you go, Katrine.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.000
It really is a terrible waste.

34:59.120 --> 35:00.240
Walk.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.040
Well...

35:25.840 --> 35:27.240
This is awkward.

35:36.680 --> 35:37.880
Here they are.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.040
You missed lunch.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.040
So, what's going on?

35:49.280 --> 35:50.880
We need you to come in
for questioning.

35:52.240 --> 35:53.720
On what grounds?

35:53.800 --> 35:54.960
Some serious allegations...

35:55.040 --> 35:56.760
I'm talking to my daughter!

35:57.240 --> 35:59.360
Dad, look, we can't disclose it here.

35:59.440 --> 36:00.480
Just...

36:02.000 --> 36:03.120
Fine.

36:03.640 --> 36:05.360
Can we finish our lunch?

36:06.320 --> 36:08.280
They've got a warrant.
If you don't go voluntarily now,

36:08.360 --> 36:09.600
they'll take you out in cuffs.

36:09.680 --> 36:11.040
The neighbors would love that.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.600
Dad, please.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.880
Don't plead, Beatrice.
It doesn't suit you.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.080
Look at you, all puffed up.

36:17.160 --> 36:18.840
Dunning-Kruger personified.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.840
Come on. Let's get this over with.

36:26.320 --> 36:27.840
Yes? Beatrice Ogilvy.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.600
No, no.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.800
Fuck! No!

36:32.880 --> 36:34.200
Kelvin's been killed!

36:43.120 --> 36:44.680
Secure house.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.720
Keep anybody out.

36:48.360 --> 36:49.880
And keep anybody in.

36:53.120 --> 36:57.320
He will get away with it.
The privileged, they always do.

36:58.040 --> 37:00.240
Well, me and especially you

37:00.320 --> 37:01.840
would have been
pepper-sprayed and Tasered.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.160
What are you doing here?

37:03.240 --> 37:04.320
I was invited.

37:05.160 --> 37:07.200
Whatever you think
you have on him,

37:07.280 --> 37:09.560
William Ogilvy will walk,

37:09.640 --> 37:12.200
and when he does,
he'll be coming for you.

37:13.280 --> 37:16.320
Copenhagen's been investigating him.
That's why I was here.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.920
I can help you,
but you need to trust me.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.440
We'll talk.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.360
They thought Kelvin
was going for the PM.

37:25.440 --> 37:28.160
He just wanted to talk
to Noomi Vilfort.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.040
What are you doing here?

37:32.680 --> 37:35.440
William thinks I'm withholding
information about Redback.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.040
-Well, are you?
-What are you gonna do about Vilfort?

37:38.120 --> 37:39.320
She'd have seen Kelvin.

37:39.880 --> 37:41.080
Yeah, I'll talk to her.

37:41.160 --> 37:42.800
Well, better coming from me.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.200
I mean, she's Danish.
I can close it off.

37:45.280 --> 37:46.600
Fine, yeah.

37:49.440 --> 37:50.720
Why would you help me?

37:52.280 --> 37:54.000
I had lunch with your father.

37:54.680 --> 37:57.000
It just made me wonder
what it was like for you,

37:57.080 --> 37:58.720
growing up with a man like that.

38:02.760 --> 38:07.560
And to the peaceful skies
above our heads.

38:07.640 --> 38:10.280
Redback.

38:14.840 --> 38:16.480
How do you know Gavriil Sergov?

38:20.960 --> 38:25.360
I've spent 30 years
building contacts,

38:26.040 --> 38:29.400
assessing who may hold
significant intelligence.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.080
Why are you toasting Redback?

38:37.160 --> 38:39.480
To take the temperature in the room.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.320
To gauge reaction.

38:46.120 --> 38:49.800
Gauging reactions?
You're not playing bridge.

38:51.400 --> 38:54.160
You really think privilege
makes you immune, innit?

38:54.880 --> 38:57.600
Is that what's festering
in your head?

38:57.680 --> 39:00.320
Promoting me
was a fucking experiment.

39:00.400 --> 39:02.600
Put a wasp and a bee in the same jar.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.400
Watch your daughter and me
sting each other to death, yeah?

39:05.480 --> 39:07.080
You're not even close.

39:07.160 --> 39:09.360
You don't fucking tell me
anything, William!

39:09.440 --> 39:12.040
What was I, your backstop?

39:12.120 --> 39:16.480
I'd be so in awe
that I couldn't bring you down.

39:17.160 --> 39:18.120
Levi...

39:20.200 --> 39:24.880
You don't have
the faintest fucking idea.

39:29.520 --> 39:30.560
Levi...

39:31.160 --> 39:32.080
Sorry.

39:41.160 --> 39:42.640
They found more evidence.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.960
We believe Mr. Ogilvy
has committed an offense

39:49.040 --> 39:51.120
prejudicial to the safety
of the state.

40:01.040 --> 40:05.720
The man that was shot,
Kelvin Cruickshanks,

40:07.320 --> 40:12.760
he didn't detonate the bomb.
But you did see him at Skanda.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.320
So why did the police lie to me?

40:20.760 --> 40:23.480
The police didn't know
that he was MI5.

40:24.480 --> 40:28.280
Agent, undercover in a terror cell.

40:30.400 --> 40:35.040
He heard a rumour
that someone placed a bomb in Skanda.

40:36.240 --> 40:38.000
So he went to find it.

40:40.480 --> 40:44.880
He didn't find it
and he couldn't blow his cover.

40:47.200 --> 40:49.000
He was obviously wrong.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.800
And that haunted him.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.480
So he didn't go to the funeral.

40:57.200 --> 41:02.120
He wanted to attack
the primeminister. I saw him.

41:03.080 --> 41:05.720
No, he came to talk to you.

41:10.440 --> 41:12.480
Now you know the truth.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.440
Beatrice, they're arresting
your father.

41:26.520 --> 41:27.680
Take your hands off me.

41:27.760 --> 41:28.960
What? No.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.560
I said take
your fucking hands off me!

41:31.640 --> 41:32.600
Dad?

41:33.120 --> 41:34.560
Call my lawyer.

41:34.640 --> 41:36.400
Come round for supper later.

41:36.480 --> 41:38.600
He's here voluntarily.
What's changed?

41:38.680 --> 41:41.200
He's being charged
under the Official Secrets Act.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.240
What...? Levi, talk to me. What...?

41:45.320 --> 41:46.920
I don't know the details.

41:50.800 --> 41:51.960
Yeah, this is Levi Nichols.

41:52.040 --> 41:53.520
Put me through
to Vauxhall Cross urgently.

41:53.600 --> 41:54.760
Oh, God, Levi, he's been framed.

41:54.840 --> 41:56.360
He fought for this country
his whole life.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.360
Yes, I'll hold. You can't visit him.

41:58.440 --> 41:59.280
What?

41:59.360 --> 42:01.080
On remand, you can't visit him.

42:01.160 --> 42:03.160
Look, just put down the fucking phone
and talk to me!

42:03.240 --> 42:04.640
Of course it's difficult to accept.

42:04.720 --> 42:06.880
He has put this job before you
every single day of your life.

42:06.960 --> 42:08.080
If that's a lie...

42:09.400 --> 42:10.360
you've got nothing.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.840
Yeah, this is Levi Nichols speaking.

42:14.920 --> 42:16.400
William Ogilvy's been arrested.

42:17.920 --> 42:19.320
Official Secrets.

42:19.880 --> 42:20.920
Russia.

42:21.600 --> 42:23.880
Yes, ma'am.
That's what I was about to suggest.

42:24.480 --> 42:25.560
Yes, ma'am.

42:29.720 --> 42:32.520
We're pulling all our agents
out of Russia with immediate effect.

42:33.640 --> 42:36.920
Right. Boys, we've got
some arrangements to make.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.520
I want a list of all agents
we currently have in the field.

43:08.640 --> 43:09.880
Heard about William.

43:13.360 --> 43:14.440
What can we do?

43:15.680 --> 43:16.960
Right now?

43:20.320 --> 43:22.400
I don't think you can do anything.

43:26.120 --> 43:28.160
I'll let my father know
that you asked.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.000
Is any of it true?

43:55.600 --> 43:58.760
Have they interrogated Sergov?

43:58.840 --> 44:00.680
He says you're working for Russia.

44:00.760 --> 44:02.600
I strongly advised you
not to visit him,

44:02.680 --> 44:03.840
and you ignored me!

44:03.920 --> 44:05.720
So, who was threatening you?

44:05.800 --> 44:07.320
Apart from you, no one.

44:07.400 --> 44:10.040
<i>Like I predicted,</i>
<i>Daesh London have the biofuels.</i>

44:10.120 --> 44:10.960
Torben Jensen?

44:11.040 --> 44:12.760
<i>The attack is planned for tonight.</i>

44:12.840 --> 44:15.640
Jelena put her life in our hands,
all right? You promised her time.

44:15.720 --> 44:17.920
So, let hundreds die
to save one life?

44:18.000 --> 44:19.680
<i>Look, I can't lose another agent.</i>

44:20.520 --> 44:23.040
When you get out,
anything you want,

44:23.120 --> 44:24.760
call me and it's yours.

44:24.840 --> 44:26.840
Somebody take her phone and PDA.

44:26.920 --> 44:28.720
I want her in a secure area
until this is over.

44:28.800 --> 44:31.040
You want me to bring him in?

44:31.120 --> 44:31.920
Preferably alive.

44:33.400 --> 44:35.320
Yes, we have an agent
in Toshino Park.

44:35.400 --> 44:37.040
She is in grave danger.

44:38.360 --> 44:39.880
The coordinates are for Copenhagen,

44:39.960 --> 44:42.640
about half a mile from where
Katrine Poulsen was living.

44:42.720 --> 44:44.840
<i>We shouldn't have been</i>
<i>in Denmark in the first place.</i>

44:44.920 --> 44:46.680
<i>This needs to go</i>
<i>to the Foreign Office.</i>

44:46.760 --> 44:48.520
Fuck the Foreign Office and fuck you.

44:49.040 --> 44:51.280
This is Redback.

44:51.960 --> 44:54.680
As sure as night follows day.

45:49.560 --> 45:51.520
