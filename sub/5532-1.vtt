01:02.417 --> 01:04.988
<i>I have no idea
how to tell this story.</i>

01:05.817 --> 01:07.865
<i>I don't even know
how to start it.</i>

01:08.017 --> 01:10.543
<i>Like, I guess I could use
one of those classic</i>

01:10.657 --> 01:12.864
<i>story beginning sentences.</i>

01:13.057 --> 01:16.345
<i>"It was the best of times;
it was the worst of times."</i>

01:16.497 --> 01:18.545
<i>But what would that even mean?</i>

01:18.937 --> 01:20.701
<i>I mean, obviously,
somewhere in the world,</i>

01:20.857 --> 01:23.064
<i>it's the best of times
for someone.</i>

01:23.217 --> 01:24.946
<i>Like he's eating all this insane</i>

01:25.057 --> 01:26.577
<i>Vietnamese food
he just got for free...</i>

01:26.737 --> 01:28.421
<i>...and the woman
who delivered the food</i>

01:28.537 --> 01:30.744
<i>looks exactly like the hot
girl from Pussy Riot</i>

01:30.897 --> 01:32.786
<i>and now she's situated
in the corner</i>

01:32.937 --> 01:35.258
<i>playing unspeakably
beautiful melodies on the harp.</i>

01:35.457 --> 01:37.221
<i>While he's just going to town
on that food.</i>

01:37.297 --> 01:39.903
<i>So, yeah,
that's the best of times.</i>

01:40.057 --> 01:42.139
<i>Meanwhile, some other guy
is having</i>

01:42.217 --> 01:44.106
<i>his will broken
by professional torturers...</i>

01:44.297 --> 01:45.344
<i>...who are suspending him</i>

01:45.417 --> 01:47.624
<i>over a crocodile-infested
pool of acid.</i>

01:47.777 --> 01:49.188
<i>And because it's acid,</i>

01:49.257 --> 01:50.907
<i>these crocodiles
are just pissed.</i>

01:51.097 --> 01:53.338
<i>And they're also piping in
that gross smell you get...</i>

01:53.417 --> 01:55.067
<i>...when they spill
a bunch of milk</i>

01:55.137 --> 01:56.184
<i>in the school parking lot.</i>

01:56.337 --> 01:57.941
<i>And this beefy torture dude</i>

01:58.017 --> 02:00.019
<i>is just punching
the hell out of him.</i>

02:00.097 --> 02:02.338
<i>Worst of times: check.</i>

02:09.657 --> 02:12.501
<i>All right, look.
I'll just start.</i>

02:12.897 --> 02:15.104
<i>This is the story of
my senior year of high school</i>

02:15.177 --> 02:16.588
<i>and how it destroyed my life.</i>

02:16.737 --> 02:20.458
<i>And how I made a film so bad,
it literally killed someone.</i>

02:47.257 --> 02:49.259
<i>I used to think about it
this way:</i>

02:49.417 --> 02:52.023
<i>Schenley High School
was a world unto itself.</i>

02:52.417 --> 02:55.341
<i>By senior year, I had mastered
the languages and customs</i>

02:55.417 --> 02:56.828
<i>of its various sovereign states.</i>

02:57.497 --> 02:59.738
<i>The head nods of Jock Nation.</i>

02:59.897 --> 03:02.503
<i>The fist bumps
of the Kingdom of Stoners.</i>

03:02.657 --> 03:04.182
<i>The innocuous witticisms of</i>

03:04.257 --> 03:05.622
<i>The People's Republic
of Theater Dorks.</i>

03:05.777 --> 03:07.666
Greg, how was your summer?

03:07.817 --> 03:09.945
Summer. What does that word
even mean?

03:10.017 --> 03:11.701
Like, more "summ"?

03:11.777 --> 03:13.177
<i>In a typical high school life,</i>

03:13.217 --> 03:14.946
<i>you belong to one nation...</i>

03:15.137 --> 03:18.186
<i>...which can never
guarantee you total security.</i>

03:18.977 --> 03:21.059
<i>But I thought
I found a way out.</i>

03:22.057 --> 03:25.061
<i>Get citizenship in every nation.</i>

03:25.657 --> 03:27.546
<i>Get passports to everywhere.</i>

03:27.697 --> 03:29.984
<i>Just be on low-key
good terms with everyone...</i>

03:30.137 --> 03:32.185
<i>...casually interact with them
once in a while...</i>

03:32.337 --> 03:35.147
<i>...in a way that is invisible
to everyone else.</i>

03:35.617 --> 03:37.221
<i>Never commit to an interaction</i>

03:37.297 --> 03:39.425
<i>that won't be casual or mellow.</i>

03:39.937 --> 03:41.462
Your test was today?

03:41.617 --> 03:43.426
Ugh. Tests!
I've been there.

03:43.577 --> 03:46.228
<i>That's like sending troops
to Afghanistan.</i>

03:46.417 --> 03:48.340
<i>Maintain relationships
with citizens</i>

03:48.417 --> 03:49.862
<i>of the most
dicked-upon nations.</i>

03:50.017 --> 03:52.304
<i>For example, Scott Mayhew,</i>

03:52.377 --> 03:54.618
<i>the gothy dork
I'm sitting next to here.</i>

03:54.777 --> 03:55.903
Scott, nice Berserker.

03:56.097 --> 03:57.223
Thank you?

03:57.377 --> 03:59.903
<i>It took years of cultivation
to win his trust.</i>

04:00.097 --> 04:01.747
<i>Yo, my name is Ill Phil</i>

04:01.817 --> 04:03.262
<i>I'll bend you to my will</i>

04:03.417 --> 04:05.863
<i>Or the universally
ostracized Ill Phil.</i>

04:05.937 --> 04:06.938
Yeah, that's good.

04:07.017 --> 04:09.145
<i>Force you to eat that pill
Now you're like, "What's the deal?"</i>

04:09.217 --> 04:10.742
<i>Truly a nation of one.</i>

04:10.897 --> 04:12.228
<i>I just got killed</i>

04:13.417 --> 04:16.182
<i>And there were some
places I simply couldn't go.</i>

04:16.337 --> 04:18.180
<i>Like the cafeteria.</i>

04:18.536 --> 04:21.939
<i>Every last square inch of it
was disputed territory.</i>

04:22.497 --> 04:24.067
<i>It was Crimea, Kashmir,</i>

04:24.137 --> 04:26.378
<i>and the Gaza Strip
all rolled into one.</i>

04:27.257 --> 04:29.988
<i>Also the part of
the Indian Ocean with pirates.</i>

04:30.577 --> 04:34.104
Captain Phillips pirates,
not Pirates of the Caribbean.

04:34.697 --> 04:37.701
<i>Although, actually, who knows?
Maybe both.</i>

04:43.857 --> 04:45.541
<i>Instead, I always ate lunch
in the office</i>

04:45.617 --> 04:46.948
<i>of my history teacher.</i>

04:47.097 --> 04:48.098
<i>Mr. McCarthy.</i>

04:48.257 --> 04:49.497
Fact:

04:49.657 --> 04:53.264
I'm in 309 for
the next... 20 minutes.

04:54.057 --> 04:56.867
<i>The only reasonable adult
in all of Schenley.</i>

04:57.017 --> 04:58.178
Heathens.

04:58.257 --> 04:59.907
Respect the research.

05:00.057 --> 05:01.946
<i>With Earl,
whose role in my life</i>

05:02.017 --> 05:04.668
<i>I'm not even gonna try to
explain to you right now.</i>

05:04.817 --> 05:09.220
<i>The harmony of overwhelming
and collective murder.</i>

05:09.417 --> 05:11.863
<i>One last thing:
hot girls destroy your life.</i>

05:11.937 --> 05:12.938
<i>That's just a fact.</i>

05:13.097 --> 05:15.703
<i>It doesn't matter if the hot
girl is also a good person.</i>

05:15.857 --> 05:18.428
<i>She's a moose,
you're a chipmunk.</i>

05:18.577 --> 05:20.705
<i>She's just wandering through
the forest, oblivious.</i>

05:22.097 --> 05:25.021
<i>And she doesn't even know that
she stomped on your head.</i>

05:27.097 --> 05:28.337
Hey, Madison.

05:28.497 --> 05:30.181
Hey, how was your summer?

05:30.337 --> 05:33.420
Summer. What does that word
even mean, right?

05:33.817 --> 05:35.546
More "summ."

05:35.817 --> 05:38.821
Winter, same deal.
More "wint"?

05:39.497 --> 05:41.306
McCarthy's in 309.

05:41.457 --> 05:43.186
Great, thanks.

05:43.537 --> 05:45.266
<i>To become humbled</i>

05:45.337 --> 05:47.226
<i>in front of
this overwhelming misery...</i>

05:47.417 --> 05:50.546
<i>...and overwhelming
fornication</i>

05:50.617 --> 05:52.187
<i>and overwhelming lack of order.</i>

05:52.297 --> 05:53.344
Titties.

05:56.217 --> 05:57.867
Honey, can we come in?
Jesus, Jesus!

05:58.017 --> 05:59.781
Yeah. What do you want?

05:59.937 --> 06:01.817
First of all,
I was going through...

06:01.897 --> 06:04.025
...your stuff
and I saw that you

06:04.097 --> 06:05.937
have not even unwrapped
your college directory.

06:06.017 --> 06:07.257
Mom, don't go through my stuff.

06:07.377 --> 06:10.381
We discussed it, and she gets
to go through your stuff.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.141
Just have a look.
It's fun.

06:12.217 --> 06:13.298
It's like a menu
for your future.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.188
What are you in the mood for?
Some Penn State?

06:16.337 --> 06:18.943
Some Pepperdine?
Pomona? Princeton?

06:19.017 --> 06:20.303
I'm not getting into Princeton.

06:20.377 --> 06:21.663
He's not getting into Princeton.

06:22.657 --> 06:23.943
Um, so, is that it?

06:24.097 --> 06:25.223
No, honey, it's not it.

06:25.377 --> 06:27.977
Your father and I want to talk to you
about something kind of sad.

06:31.017 --> 06:32.018
What?

06:36.137 --> 06:37.343
What happened?

06:37.497 --> 06:39.818
Well, I just got off the phone
with Denise Kushner,

06:39.897 --> 06:42.025
Rachel's mom. You know Denise?

06:42.297 --> 06:43.583
Um, not really.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.148
You're friends
with Rachel, though.

06:45.297 --> 06:46.981
Yeah, I mean,
we're like, acquainted.

06:47.497 --> 06:48.623
Come here.

06:50.137 --> 06:51.138
Okay.

06:57.177 --> 06:59.783
Rachel's been diagnosed
with leukemia.

07:00.057 --> 07:01.707
They just found out.

07:03.057 --> 07:04.741
Your test was today?

07:06.737 --> 07:08.739
Ugh. Tests! I've been there.

07:11.137 --> 07:12.582
Oh, God.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.388
Is that serious?

07:16.537 --> 07:17.698
They're doing
all kinds of tests.

07:17.777 --> 07:19.097
They're doing
everything they can.

07:19.257 --> 07:20.622
They just don't know.

07:20.777 --> 07:22.506
Man, that sucks.

07:22.657 --> 07:23.704
You're right.

07:23.857 --> 07:25.621
It sucks.

07:25.897 --> 07:27.661
It sucks really bad.

07:27.817 --> 07:29.819
It sucks quite a bit.

07:30.177 --> 07:31.178
Yeah.

07:36.897 --> 07:38.626
Dad, Cat Stevens is clawing me.

07:38.817 --> 07:40.945
Well, he's deeply distraught.

07:41.617 --> 07:43.267
Well, you know,
I was talking to Denise...

07:43.417 --> 07:45.897
...and Denise feels that
you might be someone...

07:46.057 --> 07:48.742
...who could make
Rachel feel better.

07:49.137 --> 07:50.866
Yeah, but like I said,

07:50.937 --> 07:51.938
we're not really friends, so...

07:52.097 --> 07:54.020
Just give Rachel a call.

07:54.777 --> 07:56.347
Yeah, well, what do you
want me to say?

07:56.497 --> 07:57.703
"Hey, it's Greg, the guy who's

07:57.777 --> 07:58.858
"never really paid
attention to you...

07:58.937 --> 08:01.383
"...but now you have cancer,
so let's hang out"?

08:01.497 --> 08:02.544
That's not gonna work.

08:02.617 --> 08:03.778
She'll think
you're being sarcastic.

08:03.857 --> 08:05.097
Are you telling me you can't do

08:05.177 --> 08:06.622
one nice thing
for another person?

08:06.777 --> 08:09.223
I mean, honestly, is that
really what's happening here?

08:09.377 --> 08:11.027
Fine. Okay.

08:11.177 --> 08:13.498
Just, please don't
go through my stuff.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.864
Or I'll start going through
your stuff.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.019
I hope you like tampons.

08:18.337 --> 08:21.625
<i>It's
Central Pittsburgh on 90.5...</i>

08:24.697 --> 08:26.108
<i>This is Rachel.</i>

08:26.257 --> 08:27.907
Hey, it's Greg Gaines.

08:28.057 --> 08:29.058
<i>Hi.</i>

08:30.737 --> 08:31.818
Yo!

08:31.977 --> 08:35.140
So, I called a doctor...

08:35.297 --> 08:38.062
...he said you needed
a prescription of Greg-acil.

08:38.217 --> 08:39.457
<i>What's that?</i>

08:39.817 --> 08:40.943
Uh...

08:41.496 --> 08:42.861
It's me.

08:44.657 --> 08:46.944
In convenient gel-tab form.

08:47.817 --> 08:48.818
<i>Oh.</i>

08:49.417 --> 08:50.418
Yeah.

08:52.417 --> 08:54.306
<i>So, I guess
you heard I'm sick.</i>

08:54.457 --> 08:55.458
Yeah.

08:55.617 --> 08:57.107
<i>Did my mom tell you?</i>

08:57.257 --> 08:59.737
Um, well, my mom told me.

08:59.937 --> 09:00.938
<i>Oh.</i>

09:01.817 --> 09:03.148
So, um...

09:03.617 --> 09:04.903
<i>What?</i>

09:05.057 --> 09:06.138
What?

09:06.577 --> 09:08.261
<i>What were you gonna say?</i>

09:08.857 --> 09:09.938
Um...

09:11.177 --> 09:12.338
<i>Greg, what?</i>

09:12.937 --> 09:14.302
Uh, yeah,
I was just calling to see

09:14.377 --> 09:16.300
if you wanted to hang out.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.988
<i>Right now?</i>

09:18.417 --> 09:20.101
Um, sure.

09:20.737 --> 09:22.068
<i>No, thanks.</i>

09:22.617 --> 09:23.698
Oh.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.945
Okay, so you don't
wanna hang out?

09:26.097 --> 09:27.986
<i>No. Thanks anyways.</i>

09:28.857 --> 09:31.144
Okay. Um, bye.

09:31.497 --> 09:32.498
<i>Bye.</i>

09:34.217 --> 09:35.662
Mom, what are you doing?

09:35.817 --> 09:37.617
Okay, Mom, listen,
she doesn't want to see me.

09:37.657 --> 09:39.261
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you, Gregory...

09:39.337 --> 09:40.338
...that you do not
have a choice

09:40.417 --> 09:41.498
in this particular matter.

09:41.577 --> 09:42.942
Mom, please, let me say
one thing for one second.

09:43.097 --> 09:44.337
You have been
given an opportunity

09:44.417 --> 09:46.545
to make a very real difference
in someone's life.

09:46.737 --> 09:48.102
And if what you're
choosing instead

09:48.177 --> 09:49.178
is to lie around the house
all day...

09:49.337 --> 09:51.624
She doesn't want to see me!

09:51.777 --> 09:53.541
...I will be required
to step in...

09:53.617 --> 09:55.221
We're not even friends!

09:55.377 --> 09:57.459
...and inform you that
that is 100% unacceptable.

09:57.617 --> 10:00.063
Your nonstop stream of
words is making me freak out!

10:00.217 --> 10:01.901
And if you think that all
these excuses you're making

10:01.977 --> 10:03.217
are in any way better...

10:03.417 --> 10:05.704
...or more important,
than the happiness

10:05.777 --> 10:06.858
of a girl with cancer...

10:07.017 --> 10:08.667
Mom! I am now entering
a subhuman state.

10:08.817 --> 10:09.943
...a friend with cancer,

10:10.017 --> 10:12.065
you are sadly mistaken,
my friend.

10:13.337 --> 10:15.465
You are going to pick up
that phone.

10:15.617 --> 10:17.938
You're going to
call Rachel again.

10:18.097 --> 10:20.464
You are going to.
You are going to.

10:48.817 --> 10:50.546
Oh, Greg.

10:52.497 --> 10:54.420
Oh, Mrs. Kushner.

10:54.857 --> 10:56.347
Denise, Greg.

10:56.977 --> 10:59.025
To you, I'm Denise, okay?

10:59.177 --> 11:00.986
Oh, okay. Good.

11:01.137 --> 11:03.458
You're a real good kid,
you know that?

11:03.617 --> 11:06.268
You really are.
You just have a big heart.

11:07.137 --> 11:09.219
You're kind, nice.

11:11.217 --> 11:13.185
I really appreciate it.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.418
Thank you.

11:17.497 --> 11:19.977
Good, good, good, good, good...

11:21.937 --> 11:22.938
...good boy.

11:23.097 --> 11:24.098
Okay.

11:24.257 --> 11:27.500
You really are kind,
big-hearted, delicious...

11:27.737 --> 11:30.104
...yummy, yummy, young boy.

11:31.217 --> 11:33.663
And you're so, so, handsome.

11:33.817 --> 11:36.548
Oh, I'm not handsome,
but thank you.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.665
And so modest.

11:39.057 --> 11:40.218
I guess I'm a modest mouse.

11:42.377 --> 11:44.744
Greg, where do you come up
with this stuff?

11:44.937 --> 11:47.258
Well, that's the name
of a band, actually.

11:47.337 --> 11:48.748
Oh.
Yeah.

11:49.817 --> 11:50.943
Rachel!

11:51.097 --> 11:54.340
I've got a modest little mouse
here to see you!

11:54.977 --> 11:55.978
Rachel.

11:56.137 --> 11:58.026
Greg, what are you doing here?

11:59.097 --> 12:00.223
So, uh...

12:01.097 --> 12:02.542
...the doctor
really recommends

12:02.617 --> 12:04.585
a strong dosage of Gregitor.

12:04.817 --> 12:06.421
You already used that joke.

12:06.577 --> 12:07.578
No.

12:08.417 --> 12:10.704
No, 'cause last time
it was about Greg-acil...

12:10.857 --> 12:13.747
...which if you recall comes
in convenient gel-tab form.

12:13.897 --> 12:16.104
Look, I don't want you
hanging out with me.

12:16.177 --> 12:17.588
I don't need your stupid pity.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.817
It's fine, you can just go.

12:18.857 --> 12:19.904
No, no.

12:20.017 --> 12:22.418
You got it all wrong. I'm not
here 'cause I pity you.

12:22.577 --> 12:25.660
I'm actually here
because my mom is making me.

12:26.857 --> 12:28.461
That's actually worse.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.107
Yeah, I know.

12:30.257 --> 12:33.579
Look, it's okay. Honestly,
I'm fine. Just... just go.

12:33.777 --> 12:36.701
Okay, Rachel, just listen
to me for a second.

12:37.417 --> 12:40.102
My mom is gonna turn my life
into a living hell...

12:40.257 --> 12:42.225
...if I don't hang out
with you.

12:42.377 --> 12:45.540
I can't overstate how annoying
she's being about this.

12:45.897 --> 12:49.026
She's basically like
the LeBron James of nagging.

12:50.897 --> 12:52.308
LeBron James plays basketball.

12:52.377 --> 12:53.822
I know who LeBron James is.

12:54.657 --> 12:57.467
Look, I know I'm not doing you
any favors here.

12:57.737 --> 12:59.978
What I'm asking is for you
to do me a favor.

13:00.177 --> 13:01.224
You want a favor from me?

13:01.377 --> 13:02.424
Yes.

13:02.577 --> 13:05.148
Just let me hang out
with you for one day.

13:05.297 --> 13:06.822
I could tell my mom
we hung out

13:06.937 --> 13:09.861
and then we'll just be
out of each other's lives.

13:10.297 --> 13:11.537
Deal?

13:13.577 --> 13:14.703
Deal.

13:15.177 --> 13:16.338
Word.

13:16.737 --> 13:19.058
Is that a Black Power salute?

13:19.217 --> 13:20.707
No, I was going in
for a fist bump.

13:20.857 --> 13:22.018
I can't fist bump you
from up here.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.305
Yeah, I realize that.

13:39.937 --> 13:41.098
Books.

13:41.777 --> 13:42.778
Nice.

13:46.497 --> 13:47.658
And, uh...

13:49.097 --> 13:50.667
...tree wallpaper.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.828
That's good.

13:53.137 --> 13:54.138
Why?

13:55.057 --> 13:56.263
I don't know.

14:23.777 --> 14:25.620
There's a lot of pillows
in here.

14:27.337 --> 14:28.384
Mmm-hmm.

14:29.057 --> 14:32.743
Seriously, like, how many...
how many pillows is that?

14:33.857 --> 14:35.097
I don't know.

14:35.897 --> 14:37.899
I wish I had
that many pillows.

14:38.137 --> 14:41.266
So, ask your parents for some.

14:41.617 --> 14:44.427
No, they'd be suspicious
or something.

14:45.497 --> 14:47.499
What, that you'd sleep
all the time?

14:47.657 --> 14:49.341
No. Probably assume

14:49.457 --> 14:51.425
I was gonna masturbate
all over them.

14:52.337 --> 14:54.499
They just have
some gross ideas about me.

14:54.577 --> 14:55.578
But that's on them.

14:56.937 --> 14:59.304
They're always getting
sexy pillows.

15:01.017 --> 15:02.223
This is a nice pillow.

15:02.297 --> 15:03.298
This pillow is a dude,
obviously...

15:03.457 --> 15:04.817
...but it reminds me
of this pillow

15:04.857 --> 15:06.427
we used to have named Francesca.

15:06.817 --> 15:08.228
They have a similar coloring.

15:08.377 --> 15:10.186
Anyway, Francesca,
we had to eventually

15:10.257 --> 15:12.225
give away because in the end...

15:12.377 --> 15:14.857
...that whole situation
was just a real problem.

15:14.937 --> 15:16.382
It was a mess.

15:16.537 --> 15:18.505
There was a real chemistry

15:18.577 --> 15:21.308
between us both that
I think no one could deny.

15:22.017 --> 15:23.701
I know the world may have
thought it was wrong...

15:23.857 --> 15:26.667
...but I think, personally,
the world was wrong...

15:26.817 --> 15:29.058
...about what
could be between...

15:30.217 --> 15:32.743
...a pillow, and a boy...

15:33.617 --> 15:35.187
...who became a man.

15:39.017 --> 15:40.621
Or whatever. I'm just...

15:41.257 --> 15:42.861
...trying to be funny.

15:43.017 --> 15:45.861
No, that was good.
Thank you.

15:48.777 --> 15:49.983
Oh, shit.

15:54.017 --> 15:55.621
I actually have to go.

15:55.937 --> 15:57.621
That's okay. Who was that?

15:57.817 --> 16:00.263
Sorry. Uh, that was Earl.

16:00.337 --> 16:01.338
Oh, who's Earl?

16:03.297 --> 16:05.379
<i>You may remember Earl
from 15 minutes ago.</i>

16:05.577 --> 16:06.578
Titties.

16:06.737 --> 16:08.819
<i>So, some people think
Earl is my friend,</i>

16:08.897 --> 16:09.978
<i>but he's really not.</i>

16:10.057 --> 16:11.661
<i>He's more like a coworker.</i>

16:11.817 --> 16:13.228
<i>I've known him
since kindergarten.</i>

16:13.417 --> 16:15.738
<i>His house is
a short walk from mine,</i>

16:15.817 --> 16:17.421
<i>but in a much
tougher neighborhood.</i>

16:17.577 --> 16:20.899
<i>His dad is in Texas, his mom
is a depressed shut-in.</i>

16:21.057 --> 16:23.105
<i>And his brother
Derrick's dog Doopie</i>

16:23.257 --> 16:25.146
<i>will definitely eat me someday.</i>

16:27.257 --> 16:29.305
Doopie, Doopie, chill!

16:34.017 --> 16:36.861
<i>So over the years we've
mostly hung out at my place.</i>

16:37.017 --> 16:40.305
<i>Usually with my dad,
a tenured sociology professor.</i>

16:40.457 --> 16:42.744
What you got, cat?
You wanna fight?

16:42.897 --> 16:45.025
Didn't think so, punk-ass cat.

16:45.177 --> 16:47.020
- Boys!
<i>- His job allows him</i>

16:47.097 --> 16:48.617
<i>to be frequently at home
doing nothing.</i>

16:48.657 --> 16:50.580
You'll want to pay
close attention to this.

16:50.737 --> 16:53.707
The insane conquistador,
Aguirre,

16:53.777 --> 16:55.017
is raging through the jungle...

16:55.177 --> 16:58.147
...in search of a golden city
that doesn't exist.

16:58.337 --> 16:59.463
<i>The wrath of God.</i>

16:59.617 --> 17:02.382
It's a classic
of foreign cinema.

17:02.537 --> 17:04.266
<i>Who else is with me?</i>

17:05.497 --> 17:07.181
<i>In addition to the best films...</i>

17:07.257 --> 17:08.383
This is cuttlefish.

17:08.537 --> 17:10.221
<i>...my house also has
the weirdest food.</i>

17:10.377 --> 17:12.345
A sea creature
much like a squid.

17:12.416 --> 17:14.704
It is a favorite East Asian
snack food.

17:14.857 --> 17:16.984
<i>Obviously we come from
pretty different backgrounds.</i>

17:17.137 --> 17:19.458
<i>But somehow, we like
most of the same things.</i>

17:19.617 --> 17:22.426
Yes, its smell is
odd and repellent

17:22.497 --> 17:23.862
to our Western noses.

17:24.017 --> 17:26.019
<i>And we learned pretty early on</i>

17:26.097 --> 17:27.617
<i>that we were the only ones
who liked...</i>

17:27.656 --> 17:30.945
<i>...for example,
classics of foreign cinema.</i>

17:32.057 --> 17:33.937
<i>Why did we like them?</i>

17:33.977 --> 17:35.388
<i>It's hard to say.</i>

17:35.577 --> 17:37.739
<i>Maybe it's that they were
weird and often violent,</i>

17:37.817 --> 17:38.978
<i>like us.</i>

17:39.137 --> 17:41.663
<i>Or confusing and possibly
meaningless, like life.</i>

17:41.817 --> 17:44.468
<i>You can't escape of
this stinkin' camp</i>

17:44.537 --> 17:45.743
<i>because you never know
when they call you.</i>

17:45.897 --> 17:47.103
<i>Because you have to be here</i>

17:47.217 --> 17:49.584
<i>because you're paid for,
you're under contract.</i>

17:51.697 --> 17:53.779
<i>Anyway,
we liked them so much</i>

17:53.857 --> 17:55.063
<i>we started making our own.</i>

17:56.217 --> 17:57.218
<i>Action!</i>

17:57.377 --> 17:59.061
<i>The idea behind
each one was...</i>

17:59.217 --> 18:00.417
<i>...we took a film
that we liked</i>

18:00.457 --> 18:02.027
<i>and made the title stupider.</i>

18:02.177 --> 18:03.383
<i>And then made a new film</i>

18:03.457 --> 18:04.902
<i>to reflect the new stupid title.</i>

18:05.057 --> 18:07.057
<i>It's a formula that only
produces horrible films...</i>

18:07.177 --> 18:09.544
<i>...but for some reason
we keep using it.</i>

18:53.257 --> 18:55.146
<i>We've made 42 films.</i>

18:55.217 --> 18:57.185
<i>You'd think we'd have stopped
making them by now.</i>

18:57.337 --> 18:58.577
<i>But we haven't.</i>

18:58.897 --> 19:00.308
<i>Honestly, it's like
you can't go anywhere.</i>

19:00.497 --> 19:03.068
<i>You can't escape
this stinking place...</i>

19:03.217 --> 19:05.060
<i>...because you don't know
when they call you...</i>

19:05.217 --> 19:06.343
<i>...'cause you're on contract</i>

19:06.417 --> 19:08.784
<i>and you're paid to be here,
it's bullshit.</i>

19:08.937 --> 19:10.507
<i>Yeah, and it's like, you know,</i>

19:10.577 --> 19:12.545
<i>I can't do anything.
I'm not a free person.</i>

19:12.697 --> 19:15.860
Truly, one of my favorites
from your oeuvre.

19:16.497 --> 19:19.341
A mature investigation
into the nature of violence.

19:19.497 --> 19:21.738
Dad, for like
the billionth time,

19:21.817 --> 19:23.501
you're not allowed
to watch these.

19:24.417 --> 19:26.101
I'm a fan.

19:27.857 --> 19:29.905
You gonna go see
that girl again?

19:31.097 --> 19:33.225
I mean, probably, yeah.

19:33.377 --> 19:34.981
You gonna play
with them titties?

19:35.137 --> 19:37.583
No. It's not like that.

19:37.737 --> 19:38.738
Well, that's not right.

19:38.897 --> 19:40.740
I mean, this could be
her last chance on Earth

19:40.817 --> 19:41.978
to be with a man.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.502
Don't make this about you.

19:43.657 --> 19:44.658
Earl!

19:45.457 --> 19:47.459
First of all,
if it's that high-stakes,

19:47.537 --> 19:49.665
probably won't even be able
to get a boner.

19:50.497 --> 19:52.784
Did I even say shit
about boners?

19:52.937 --> 19:53.984
No.

19:54.657 --> 19:58.742
What kind of cancer even is
acute myelogenous leukemia?

19:59.657 --> 20:02.228
You know, cancer of the, uh...

20:03.217 --> 20:04.787
...the thing.

20:06.097 --> 20:07.303
<i>It's bullshit!</i>

20:08.017 --> 20:11.100
The Battle of Antietam was
the bloodiest day

20:11.177 --> 20:12.817
in American history.

20:13.017 --> 20:14.940
Class, what do you have to
say for yourselves?

20:15.097 --> 20:16.137
Respect the research.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.578
That is what
I'm talking about!

20:19.737 --> 20:21.262
All right,
run for your lives.

20:21.337 --> 20:23.465
Save yourselves.
Go, go, go, go, go.

20:23.897 --> 20:25.387
Good work today, everybody.

20:25.897 --> 20:28.628
Way to go. Bam.
Love it. Good stuff.

20:28.777 --> 20:30.461
Good job.
Excellent work today.

20:30.617 --> 20:32.540
Excellent. Nice job.
Hey, can I talk to you?

20:32.697 --> 20:33.778
Can I talk to you for a second?

20:33.857 --> 20:35.222
Sure, Greg, what's up?

20:35.697 --> 20:39.418
Uh, do you know
any facts about leukemia?

20:39.577 --> 20:40.578
Leukemia?

20:40.737 --> 20:45.425
Yeah, it's a cancer of the
blood and/or bone marrow.

20:45.577 --> 20:46.578
Why?

20:46.737 --> 20:49.183
Right, so it's pretty
spread out in the body?

20:49.337 --> 20:50.862
That is a fact, yes.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.304
How soon do people die from it?

20:53.457 --> 20:55.425
I think it's often
pretty treatable, bud.

20:55.497 --> 20:56.623
Why do you ask?

20:56.697 --> 20:59.780
Well, you know Rachel Kushner
has leukemia, right?

20:59.937 --> 21:01.268
Wait, Rachel has what?

21:01.937 --> 21:04.178
I'm, like,
innovatively stupid.

21:05.657 --> 21:08.058
Everyone was gonna find out
sooner or later.

21:08.217 --> 21:10.538
Just hate having to share
everything about myself.

21:10.697 --> 21:11.937
I'm the exact same way.

21:12.577 --> 21:14.500
You know,
one thing you can do

21:14.577 --> 21:15.817
if you don't want to
talk to anyone...

21:15.897 --> 21:17.740
...is just enter
a subhuman state.

21:19.937 --> 21:21.746
Here, pretend you're
someone annoying.

21:29.457 --> 21:30.663
"Hi, Rachel.

21:30.737 --> 21:32.102
"I'm really sorry
you have cancer."

21:46.217 --> 21:47.503
Does that ever work?

21:48.057 --> 21:50.901
Yeah, of course.
It works all the time.

21:51.137 --> 21:53.060
It's called passive resistance.

21:53.257 --> 21:55.385
You know, that's what Gandhi
was all about.

21:55.537 --> 21:57.904
I'm pretty sure Gandhi
never did the subhuman thing.

21:58.337 --> 21:59.862
Yeah, he did.

22:00.657 --> 22:03.706
That's how India achieved
statehood. Here, try it.

22:07.657 --> 22:08.783
Nope.

22:08.977 --> 22:10.103
Come on, it's easy.

22:12.297 --> 22:15.221
Okay. Or another thing
you can do is just

22:15.297 --> 22:16.947
flat-out pretend to be dead.

22:18.137 --> 22:19.980
Say something annoying to me.

22:20.057 --> 22:21.058
Um...

22:22.497 --> 22:24.386
"Hey, Rachel. I just want you
to remember

22:24.497 --> 22:26.898
"that your cancer
is all part of God's plan."

22:33.377 --> 22:35.027
<i>Hey, asshole.</i>

22:35.177 --> 22:36.827
<i>Yeah, over here.</i>

22:37.457 --> 22:38.788
<i>Just so
we're straight on this,</i>

22:38.857 --> 22:40.461
<i>you're advising
a girl with cancer...</i>

22:40.617 --> 22:42.984
<i>...to pretend to be dead.</i>

22:44.057 --> 22:45.183
<i>No, seriously.</i>

22:45.257 --> 22:47.017
<i>Think about what you're
doing here, dickhead.</i>

22:47.097 --> 22:48.861
<i>I've been doing
my broody Wolverine face on</i>

22:48.977 --> 22:49.978
<i>this girl's wall...</i>

22:50.137 --> 22:51.662
<i>...for five
and a quarter years,</i>

22:51.737 --> 22:53.148
<i>and at this point, I'm
probably only still here...</i>

22:53.297 --> 22:54.901
<i>...because she'd feel
weirdly guilty</i>

22:54.977 --> 22:56.263
<i>or disloyal taking me down.</i>

22:56.417 --> 22:58.146
<i>But I'm goddamned if I'm letting</i>

22:58.217 --> 22:59.737
<i>a little punk like you
waltz in here...</i>

22:59.777 --> 23:01.063
<i>...stupiding up the place!</i>

23:01.217 --> 23:02.378
<i>Not on my watch, pal.</i>

23:02.537 --> 23:03.823
Greg, what's wrong?

23:05.977 --> 23:07.581
I'm really sorry.

23:08.697 --> 23:10.577
I shouldn't have told you
to pretend to be dead.

23:10.617 --> 23:12.506
That was really insensitive.

23:13.497 --> 23:15.101
I mean, I'm sick.
I'm not dying.

23:15.297 --> 23:17.379
Yeah, I know, but I just...

23:17.537 --> 23:19.266
Now I'm being
all weird about it.

23:19.417 --> 23:21.943
And I can't get un-weird,
'cause I just...

23:22.137 --> 23:23.343
Despite what you said,

23:23.417 --> 23:25.057
I'm clearly still
sitting here thinking...

23:25.097 --> 23:26.897
..."death, death, death,
death, death, death."

23:39.537 --> 23:42.017
That's exactly
what I'm talking about!

23:44.217 --> 23:46.424
<i>So if this was
a touching romantic story...</i>

23:46.617 --> 23:48.142
<i>...this is probably
where a new feeling</i>

23:48.217 --> 23:49.218
<i>would wash over me...</i>

23:49.377 --> 23:50.503
<i>...and our eyes would meet</i>

23:50.577 --> 23:52.261
<i>and suddenly we would be
furiously making out...</i>

23:52.457 --> 23:54.141
<i>...with the fire
of a thousand suns.</i>

23:58.937 --> 24:01.065
<i>But this isn't
a touching romantic story.</i>

24:01.257 --> 24:02.418
Anyway...
Yep.

24:02.817 --> 24:05.024
<i>But we did
still become friends.</i>

24:12.137 --> 24:14.265
Daniel Craig's thing is,
he's got an accent, right?

24:14.417 --> 24:17.148
So he's used to talking with
his mouth in a weird shape...

24:17.297 --> 24:19.345
...which is why he has
pouty lips, like a woman.

24:19.537 --> 24:22.347
Lickable technology, like,
I could text you a sandwich.

24:22.497 --> 24:23.658
I think that's where phones
are headed.

24:23.817 --> 24:26.787
There's a button on the nape
of his neck, under the skin.

24:26.937 --> 24:28.826
Just push it
if you want him to stop.

24:29.217 --> 24:31.379
Do you believe animals
just live in our house,

24:31.497 --> 24:33.022
and everyone's cool with it?

24:33.177 --> 24:34.906
Like, real animals?

24:35.057 --> 24:37.424
Anyway. You talk now.

24:37.817 --> 24:39.819
You mean, talk about cancer?

24:39.977 --> 24:41.627
Only if you want to.

24:42.217 --> 24:43.946
The hardest part is
watching my mom

24:44.017 --> 24:45.428
trying to deal with it all.

24:45.497 --> 24:48.467
And sometimes, I mean,
I do think if it ends up

24:48.537 --> 24:50.699
that she's alone
in that house...

24:50.857 --> 24:52.700
She has no one.
She and my dad hate each other.

24:52.777 --> 24:54.267
She has no siblings.

24:54.417 --> 24:56.146
I don't know what she'd do.

24:58.257 --> 24:59.543
Don't cry.

24:59.697 --> 25:01.187
I'm not crying.

25:01.817 --> 25:04.024
Right, well, you know,
you can cry if you need to.

25:04.177 --> 25:05.986
I thought you said,
"Don't cry."

25:06.057 --> 25:07.468
Um...

25:08.857 --> 25:10.586
Me and my dad used to
walk around the block

25:10.657 --> 25:12.261
and count squirrels.

25:12.737 --> 25:14.617
Why? Did he work for, like,
the squirrel census?

25:14.737 --> 25:16.102
No, it was just something we did

25:16.177 --> 25:18.384
when it was time for us
to spend time together.

25:18.537 --> 25:19.902
We didn't even say anything
while we did it.

25:19.977 --> 25:21.627
All we'd say was stuff like:

25:21.777 --> 25:24.542
"Squirrel, seven."
"Two squirrels, nine."

25:24.697 --> 25:28.588
Jesus. You need to apply
for a dad refund immediately.

25:28.737 --> 25:29.817
What group am I in?

25:29.937 --> 25:30.938
What?

25:31.137 --> 25:32.821
Yesterday you were
saying you'd mapped out

25:32.897 --> 25:34.177
the entire high school by group.

25:34.297 --> 25:35.537
What's my group?

25:35.697 --> 25:37.540
Seriously?
Yeah.

25:37.697 --> 25:41.144
Boring Jewish Senior Girls,
Subgroup 2-A.

25:42.417 --> 25:44.137
Please appreciate
how honest I was just now.

25:44.177 --> 25:45.178
You're an asshole.

25:46.177 --> 25:47.941
What group are you in?

25:48.097 --> 25:50.987
Uh, I'm not
in a group, actually.

25:51.137 --> 25:54.266
I just wouldn't belong to
a group that doesn't suck.

25:54.857 --> 25:57.463
You know,
I'm terminally awkward

25:57.537 --> 25:59.539
and I have a face
like a little groundhog.

25:59.617 --> 26:00.664
So...

26:00.737 --> 26:02.705
You can't really think that.

26:03.297 --> 26:04.981
No, I don't think that.

26:05.217 --> 26:06.548
I know that.

26:06.897 --> 26:10.583
I just feel like, you know,
for a kid like me...

26:11.577 --> 26:14.820
...in high school,
best case scenario,

26:14.897 --> 26:16.422
just... survive. You know?

26:16.577 --> 26:19.262
Survive without creating
any mortal enemies...

26:19.417 --> 26:21.897
...or hideously embarrassing
yourself forever.

26:22.057 --> 26:24.059
Just survive until college?

26:24.217 --> 26:27.585
College? No. God, college is
going to be even worse.

26:27.857 --> 26:28.858
What?

26:29.017 --> 26:31.623
I mean, at least high school,
it's over at 3:00...

26:31.777 --> 26:34.747
...and it's kids
I mostly know by now.

26:34.897 --> 26:36.777
But college is just gonna be
non-stop strangers.

26:36.857 --> 26:38.302
And some of them
even live in your room.

26:38.417 --> 26:40.579
It's like you can
literally never relax.

26:40.737 --> 26:43.661
I see myself dying of
a panic attack two weeks in.

26:44.417 --> 26:45.862
I might just not apply.

26:46.017 --> 26:48.702
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard you say.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.258
It's probably not even top five.

26:52.017 --> 26:54.827
And, you know,
high school, college,

26:54.897 --> 26:56.262
we're forced to spend
these years of our lives...

26:56.417 --> 26:58.385
...in randomly selected
groups of people

26:58.457 --> 27:00.221
that we have nothing
in common with.

27:00.377 --> 27:01.867
It's a nightmare.

27:02.457 --> 27:04.903
Anyone who says otherwise
is lying.

27:06.137 --> 27:07.138
Congratulations, Greg.

27:07.297 --> 27:08.458
Tomorrow,
you're eating lunch with

27:08.537 --> 27:11.381
Boring Jewish Senior Girls,
Subgroup 2-A.

27:14.897 --> 27:16.308
So where do you usually sit?

27:18.377 --> 27:21.301
It's literally like we're trying
to have lunch in Kandahar.

27:24.857 --> 27:28.225
Rachel, we just found out the
theme for this year's prom:

27:28.377 --> 27:30.027
"A Knight to Remember."

27:30.217 --> 27:31.901
Knight with a Medieval prom!

27:32.057 --> 27:34.378
Isn't prom like six months away?

27:34.537 --> 27:35.538
Hi, guys. This is Greg,

27:35.617 --> 27:37.540
he's gonna be
sitting with us today.

27:37.697 --> 27:40.428
Anybody need any spoons? No?

27:42.657 --> 27:43.863
Hello.

27:45.657 --> 27:48.627
So, Greg, why are you
sitting with us today?

27:48.817 --> 27:50.785
You know, it's lunch.

27:50.937 --> 27:53.019
You gotta eat somewhere.
Can't stand and eat.

27:53.137 --> 27:56.664
You and Rachel seem very
friendly, all of a sudden.

27:56.817 --> 27:58.148
Yeah.

27:58.217 --> 28:00.177
You're only talking to her
because she has cancer.

28:00.217 --> 28:01.218
What?

28:01.297 --> 28:03.459
Greg, you hung out
with Rachel once.

28:03.617 --> 28:05.267
You're befriending her to
feel good about yourself.

28:05.457 --> 28:06.697
No, I'm not.

28:06.857 --> 28:07.858
Who even does that?

28:11.737 --> 28:12.738
You guys mind
if I sit with you?

28:12.817 --> 28:13.818
Of course not.

28:16.377 --> 28:17.663
Sorry, it's a...

28:17.817 --> 28:19.467
It's a pillow.
It's meant to be a baby,

28:19.537 --> 28:20.868
for health class.

28:21.257 --> 28:22.463
You think it's safe here?

28:22.617 --> 28:23.823
A pillow?

28:24.897 --> 28:26.103
Greg, what do you think?

28:26.457 --> 28:27.663
Mmm, I don't know.

28:27.857 --> 28:29.188
Better not get it
too close to me,

28:29.257 --> 28:31.942
otherwise I might just
masturbate onto it.

28:32.897 --> 28:34.945
Ew, Greg,
that's just weird and gross.

28:39.777 --> 28:40.778
Hey, everyone,

28:40.857 --> 28:42.939
check out Scott Mayhew's
Tyrannosaurus walk.

28:43.097 --> 28:45.418
It's a great way to get
from point A to point B.

28:46.017 --> 28:47.382
That was really mean, Greg.

28:47.537 --> 28:49.027
I think he heard you.

28:55.137 --> 28:56.707
<i>And just like that...</i>

28:58.057 --> 29:00.059
<i>...eight years
of carefully-cultivated</i>

29:00.137 --> 29:02.458
<i>invisibility... gone.</i>

29:03.617 --> 29:04.618
Fin.

29:05.697 --> 29:07.461
Your mom made cookies?

29:07.617 --> 29:10.905
Nah, I won them off
of Ill Phil in a game of tonk.

29:11.377 --> 29:13.857
Got tired of whooping
your sorry ass.

29:14.297 --> 29:16.538
Why do they even call it
Scholar Horizons Biology?

29:16.737 --> 29:20.139
Maybe they should call it
Scholar Horizons Tonk.

29:20.297 --> 29:21.901
Or Sometimes Paper Football.

29:22.057 --> 29:23.388
Heathens.

29:23.577 --> 29:25.147
What up?
Hi, Mr. McCarthy.

29:26.817 --> 29:27.818
Wow.

29:28.737 --> 29:32.025
Earl, fact,
that lunch is garbage.

29:32.177 --> 29:35.340
You're literally poisoning
yourself right in front of us.

29:35.617 --> 29:37.426
At least I ain't eating
no funky ass

29:37.497 --> 29:39.659
seaweed-looking tentacle soup.

29:39.977 --> 29:42.742
Seriously, this stuff
is the business.

29:42.897 --> 29:45.059
It's Vietnamese.
It's called Pho.

29:45.137 --> 29:46.901
It is "Pho-nomenal."

29:47.057 --> 29:48.582
Well, let me try some one time.

29:48.737 --> 29:49.738
Mmm.

29:50.817 --> 29:52.581
Now you want to try some?
Yeah.

29:52.777 --> 29:53.858
Well, no.

29:54.017 --> 29:56.463
It's strictly forbidden for me
to give you food.

29:56.657 --> 29:58.102
However, if you go to...

29:59.297 --> 30:01.903
...Thuyen's Super
Saigon Flavor

30:01.977 --> 30:03.308
over in Lawrenceville...

30:03.497 --> 30:04.908
...and ask for Thuyen.

30:05.057 --> 30:08.220
Tell him to put it on my tab.
You'll be all set.

30:10.817 --> 30:13.138
I ain't going to
no damn Lawrenceville.

30:13.457 --> 30:14.902
Fair enough.

30:16.977 --> 30:18.866
You'll have to excuse me.

30:22.337 --> 30:23.384
Boys.

30:23.537 --> 30:25.141
Respect the research.

30:25.297 --> 30:26.298
Respect!

30:33.137 --> 30:34.901
God! You know,
people just assume that

30:34.977 --> 30:36.388
Rachel and I are dating.

30:36.537 --> 30:37.538
It's ruining my life.

30:37.737 --> 30:40.388
Today I threatened to
sexually assault a fake baby.

30:40.737 --> 30:43.217
And I became mortal enemies
with Scott Mayhew.

30:43.377 --> 30:45.186
Both of which
are Rachel's fault.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.941
Sorry, but they just are.

30:48.097 --> 30:50.384
Of course I'm a dick
for complaining about it.

30:50.977 --> 30:53.423
I mean, I am a dick
for complaining about it.

30:54.057 --> 30:55.946
I didn't actually mean
any of that.

30:56.097 --> 30:57.940
Better play with them titties.

31:02.537 --> 31:04.460
Does this taste strange to you?

32:01.817 --> 32:03.660
<i>The soup had drugs.</i>

32:08.817 --> 32:09.898
Whoa!

32:14.737 --> 32:16.148
McCarthy must've
put weed in that soup

32:16.217 --> 32:17.662
because my brain
is trying to eat itself.

32:17.817 --> 32:18.978
Oh, my God.

32:19.057 --> 32:20.582
I have to go visit
Rachel right now.

32:20.737 --> 32:21.943
Okay, well, you do that.

32:22.097 --> 32:24.259
I'ma be at your house
eatin' up all your dad's food.

32:24.417 --> 32:26.260
No! You have to
come help!

32:26.417 --> 32:27.498
Help with what?

32:27.657 --> 32:28.738
Help!

32:31.497 --> 32:33.465
Hey, in class,
do McCarthy act all, like,

32:33.577 --> 32:35.022
stoned and shit?

32:35.577 --> 32:37.500
Uh, I don't know.
I guess.

32:37.657 --> 32:39.022
Yeah, sometimes.

32:39.177 --> 32:40.667
Well, not sometimes,

32:40.777 --> 32:42.302
but you know what I'm...
You know how he is.

32:42.457 --> 32:44.107
Goddamn, son.

32:44.177 --> 32:46.100
You can't even put a full damn
sentence together.

32:46.257 --> 32:49.101
It's insane that Mr. McCarthy
eats soup with drugs in it.

32:49.257 --> 32:52.101
Hey, come on, man,
keep your damn voice down.

33:04.097 --> 33:05.986
We can't tell anyone
we're on drugs.

33:06.177 --> 33:07.622
Why the hell not?

33:09.817 --> 33:11.785
Because then they'll know.

33:30.897 --> 33:33.184
It's my humble little mouse.

33:33.657 --> 33:35.978
And who is
his little mouse friend?

33:37.817 --> 33:39.342
Earl Jackson.

33:39.977 --> 33:43.379
Earl's just my coworker,
and, uh, he's a great guy.

33:43.537 --> 33:45.858
We were just walking around
the neighborhood, you know.

33:46.017 --> 33:48.463
Not really doing anything,

33:48.537 --> 33:50.097
and just wanted
to come say "What's up?"

33:50.177 --> 33:52.179
'Cause Rachel's
about to lose her hair.

33:52.537 --> 33:54.027
Mmm.
So, just wanted to say,

33:54.097 --> 33:56.748
you know,
"Bye, hair. Good riddance."

33:57.377 --> 34:00.062
She's gonna look great without
hair. That's a fact, so...

34:00.217 --> 34:01.946
Yeah, I just wanted to say
what's up.

34:02.097 --> 34:05.101
Rachel! We've got
two cute little mouse boys

34:05.177 --> 34:07.020
on our doorstep
that wanna say hi!

34:10.097 --> 34:15.024
Would you two... mice
like a little bit of cheese?

34:19.016 --> 34:20.178
Okay.

34:27.217 --> 34:29.139
I like your room, Rachel.

34:29.536 --> 34:31.699
Thanks. Greg thinks
it's too girly.

34:31.857 --> 34:34.428
No, I love girly,
I think it's fine.

34:34.577 --> 34:35.703
Well,
it ain't too girly.

34:35.777 --> 34:36.777
I mean, I done seen some
rooms where I'm like:

34:36.976 --> 34:38.706
"Yo, this some
pink puffy bullshit."

34:38.897 --> 34:40.137
I mean, Hello Kitty posters

34:40.217 --> 34:42.458
and chocolate and naked dudes
all over the wall.

34:42.617 --> 34:44.540
They make me want to
throw up for real.

34:44.697 --> 34:47.428
Hey, if you're gonna throw up,
don't do it in here, okay?

34:47.536 --> 34:48.538
This is her room.

34:50.056 --> 34:51.388
Anyways.

34:51.536 --> 34:54.380
Rachel, we really just wanted
to see how you was doin'.

34:54.777 --> 34:55.777
Thanks.

34:55.937 --> 34:58.747
Yeah, chemotherapy.
That really sucks.

34:58.897 --> 34:59.898
Greg.

35:00.737 --> 35:03.820
What the hell, bro?
Don't say it suck, dumb-ass!

35:03.977 --> 35:05.502
It does kinda suck.

35:05.657 --> 35:07.739
Yeah, but I mean, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

35:07.897 --> 35:09.262
Yeah, I guess.

35:11.177 --> 35:12.178
Um...

35:14.577 --> 35:15.658
Uh...

35:15.897 --> 35:17.217
Look, you guys can go
if you want.

35:17.337 --> 35:19.021
We're on drugs.
Oh, shit!

35:19.177 --> 35:20.417
Why are you on drugs?

35:20.577 --> 35:22.147
Well, we're accidentally
on drugs.

35:22.297 --> 35:23.423
"Accidentally"?

35:23.577 --> 35:25.261
McCarthy gave us some soup.

35:25.417 --> 35:27.624
Well, McCarthy gave us
some of his,

35:27.777 --> 35:29.347
you know, just regular,
normal soup...

35:29.497 --> 35:30.578
...but then, it was
the last of the soup

35:30.697 --> 35:31.937
so we had to go get some more...

35:31.977 --> 35:33.786
...from a restaurant,

35:33.857 --> 35:35.621
on the fifth floor
of an office building.

35:35.777 --> 35:37.063
And in the same building,

35:37.137 --> 35:38.377
there was a Jamaican embassy...

35:38.457 --> 35:40.858
...and we ended up
getting trapped

35:40.937 --> 35:42.497
in an elevator
with a Rastafarian guy...

35:42.617 --> 35:45.302
...and he just hotboxed
the whole elevator, so...

35:45.457 --> 35:47.778
We were stuck in there
for, like, 25 minutes...

35:47.937 --> 35:49.143
...and we had to breathe
the weird marijuana air.

35:49.297 --> 35:50.867
Earl, am I right?

35:51.017 --> 35:52.462
That's exactly what happened.

35:53.217 --> 35:55.618
You guys had
quite an adventure.

35:55.777 --> 35:58.303
Being on drugs
just really sucks.

35:58.377 --> 35:59.867
Being around people
on drugs sucks.

36:00.057 --> 36:03.584
This whole situation, really
sorry, just sucks. I'm sorry.

36:03.777 --> 36:06.348
Yo, yo. What the hell
is your problem, man?

36:06.497 --> 36:07.908
All apologetic and shit,

36:07.977 --> 36:09.024
making shit
'bout your sorry ass.

36:09.177 --> 36:11.145
Look, that's not what we came
here to do. Okay?

36:11.297 --> 36:12.822
You wanna help,
you gonna take this girl out

36:12.897 --> 36:14.547
to get some ice cream.

36:15.137 --> 36:17.185
And me, too,
'cause I love that shit.

36:17.337 --> 36:18.498
You like ice cream?

36:18.657 --> 36:19.658
Yeah.

36:20.137 --> 36:22.139
So, you know
Greg from class?

36:22.857 --> 36:24.905
I've known Greg
ever since we were little.

36:25.057 --> 36:26.980
You know, I was in
y'all kindergarten, right?

36:27.137 --> 36:28.298
Really?

36:28.377 --> 36:29.902
Mmm-hmm. I remember you.

36:29.977 --> 36:31.979
You was the girl who called
Justin Jones perverted...

36:32.057 --> 36:34.424
...for showing girls
the birthmark on his butt.

36:34.577 --> 36:35.783
Oh, my God, yes!

36:36.257 --> 36:37.941
Yeah, dude came running up,

36:38.057 --> 36:39.900
showed you his butt.
You were calm.

36:40.097 --> 36:42.668
Said, "Justin, only perverts
show their butts."

36:42.737 --> 36:43.777
I was right there.

36:43.937 --> 36:45.746
I can't believe
you remember that.

36:45.937 --> 36:49.180
You a hero. Shut his
perverted ass right down.

36:49.337 --> 36:50.862
I never forget it.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.705
So you and Greg are coworkers?

36:53.857 --> 36:54.938
Naw, we friends.

36:55.017 --> 36:57.497
He just hates calling people
his friend. Dude's got issues.

36:57.737 --> 37:00.104
Yeah, he does.
What's going on?

37:00.257 --> 37:02.783
Man, I don't even know.
It might be his folks.

37:02.937 --> 37:04.826
I mean, dude's mom
always tellin' him

37:04.897 --> 37:06.706
how handsome he is,
which he ain't.

37:06.857 --> 37:09.701
So now he think he can't trust
anybody close to him.

37:09.857 --> 37:10.983
Dude's weird-ass dad

37:11.057 --> 37:13.298
don't socialize with anybody
'cept the cat.

37:13.457 --> 37:15.858
So that's a role model
ain't got no friends.

37:16.257 --> 37:17.827
Bottom line, dude's terrified

37:17.897 --> 37:19.547
of callin' somebody
his friend...

37:19.697 --> 37:21.904
...and they sayin', "Hey, bro,
I'm not your friend."

37:22.097 --> 37:23.337
Then he'd have to kill himself.

37:23.617 --> 37:25.460
But how are you coworkers?

37:25.617 --> 37:28.268
We, um, we make films.

37:28.537 --> 37:29.698
Movies?

37:29.897 --> 37:32.741
Yeah. We been making them
for a few years now.

37:32.897 --> 37:34.945
We have, like, 42 in total.

37:35.297 --> 37:36.901
Greg! You never told me.

37:37.057 --> 37:38.297
Well, we never told
anybody 'bout them.

37:38.377 --> 37:40.379
They suck.
I mean, they're terrible.

37:40.577 --> 37:42.386
I'm pretty sure they don't suck.

37:42.577 --> 37:44.739
Well, you can see
for yourself if you want.

37:45.217 --> 37:46.264
Are you sure?

37:46.417 --> 37:47.498
Hell, yeah,
don't even worry about it.

37:47.657 --> 37:48.658
Just don't tell nobody.

37:48.737 --> 37:50.148
No, of course,
I won't.

37:51.457 --> 37:53.027
All right, son,
get on your feet.

37:53.097 --> 37:54.098
Sounds good.

37:54.897 --> 37:56.422
Where are we going?

37:58.777 --> 38:02.145
<i>A candy-colored
clown they call the sandman</i>

38:02.577 --> 38:05.103
<i>Tiptoes to my room every night</i>

38:06.297 --> 38:08.868
<i>Just to sprinkle stardust
and to whisper</i>

38:09.777 --> 38:14.988
<i>Go to sleep,
everything is all right</i>

38:16.297 --> 38:18.982
<i>I close my eyes</i>

38:20.697 --> 38:22.301
<i>Then I drift away</i>

38:23.777 --> 38:25.108
We can walk you home.

38:25.257 --> 38:26.377
He needs to recover,

38:26.457 --> 38:28.459
and you probably
should look after him.

38:30.017 --> 38:31.098
Peace, peace.

38:31.257 --> 38:32.827
Thanks.
Bye.

38:35.857 --> 38:37.780
Goddamn it, Earl.

38:37.937 --> 38:39.621
Son, don't even start.

38:39.777 --> 38:41.188
Pig's foot.

38:45.457 --> 38:48.222
<i>So, we're pretty far
into this stupid story now...</i>

38:48.377 --> 38:50.903
<i>...and you're probably
saying to yourself,</i>

38:50.977 --> 38:52.502
<i>"Hey. I like this girl Rachel.</i>

38:52.657 --> 38:55.137
<i>"And I'm gonna be pissed
if she dies at the end."</i>

38:55.297 --> 38:58.983
<i>So, I'm just telling you:
don't freak out. She survives.</i>

38:59.817 --> 39:02.297
<i>So, hopefully,
that reassures you.</i>

39:03.737 --> 39:05.819
<i>Although, actually,
why would it?</i>

39:05.977 --> 39:09.060
I'm just overwhelmed
with your enthusiasm today.

39:09.217 --> 39:10.742
I guess we're just gonna have
to do it

39:10.817 --> 39:12.660
the old-fashioned way.

39:13.177 --> 39:14.667
I'm thinking of one of you.

39:14.817 --> 39:16.387
I'm not gonna mention any names,

39:16.497 --> 39:18.067
but your initials...

39:18.257 --> 39:19.258
...are Scott Mayhew.

39:19.737 --> 39:21.819
Fact: Greg's been
telling everyone

39:21.897 --> 39:23.228
your soup has marijuana in it.

39:23.377 --> 39:24.902
I didn't tell anyone.

39:25.097 --> 39:26.701
I heard you bellowing
about it on public transit.

39:26.857 --> 39:28.746
Is that a fact, Greg?

39:30.937 --> 39:34.020
Look, yesterday,
Earl and I got stoned somehow.

39:34.177 --> 39:35.861
And it was after
we both ate your soup.

39:36.017 --> 39:37.337
And we didn't smoke
any marijuana,

39:37.377 --> 39:38.902
which I have never done,
so...

39:39.057 --> 39:40.297
Your soup must have drugs in it,

39:40.337 --> 39:41.782
'cause that was the only thing
we both ate...

39:41.857 --> 39:43.746
...other than some cookies
we got from Ill Phil,

39:43.857 --> 39:45.347
the drug dealer.

39:46.857 --> 39:48.018
Aha.

39:48.697 --> 39:50.904
Man, how did you not know
it was the cookies?

39:51.057 --> 39:54.266
Man, it was your dumb ass
yelling that shit on the bus.

39:54.457 --> 39:55.697
Yo, Greg!

39:55.857 --> 39:57.461
Did you snitch on me?

39:57.617 --> 39:59.107
He did snitch on you!

39:59.857 --> 40:00.904
I was there.

40:01.057 --> 40:02.821
I heard you ridiculing me

40:02.897 --> 40:04.706
in front of
your loathsome harem.

40:05.217 --> 40:07.743
You have made...
a mortal enemy.

40:08.257 --> 40:09.861
And I will never stop
hounding you.

40:09.977 --> 40:12.821
Yeah, you made two mortal
enemies. I stabbed a dude.

40:12.937 --> 40:13.938
Jesus.

40:14.057 --> 40:15.547
<i>I'll kill you 20 different ways</i>

40:15.617 --> 40:16.948
<i>Stab you with blades</i>

40:17.097 --> 40:20.146
<i>Shoot you with death rays
Abandon you in a maze</i>

40:20.297 --> 40:22.743
<i>Choke you on mayonnaise</i>

40:46.577 --> 40:48.659
So they haven't really
done anything.

40:48.737 --> 40:50.421
It's been about a month now.

40:50.657 --> 40:53.342
They did say they're never
gonna stop hounding me...

40:53.497 --> 40:56.307
...so, sooner or later...
you know...

40:56.457 --> 40:57.868
...gonna get hounded.

41:00.457 --> 41:03.779
Sorry, next time
I'll bring you some flowers.

41:05.097 --> 41:06.940
Though I don't even know
where I'd put them.

41:07.097 --> 41:09.941
It's like, like the only place
left is the barf bucket.

41:12.817 --> 41:14.342
Flowers.

41:15.977 --> 41:17.467
Where you barf.

41:23.297 --> 41:24.787
I like that hat.

41:26.457 --> 41:27.947
It's pretty cute.

41:32.377 --> 41:36.302
Look, I've never
been very beautiful...

41:36.777 --> 41:40.304
...and that's fine because
that's not important to me.

41:40.617 --> 41:41.857
But...

41:44.337 --> 41:46.339
I thought it'd be
easier looking like this.

41:46.457 --> 41:47.743
It's just not.

41:50.297 --> 41:52.982
Everyone comes in here
and sees me...

41:53.297 --> 41:55.698
...and they're
so clearly repulsed.

41:56.857 --> 41:59.337
It's so much harder
than I thought it would be.

41:59.817 --> 42:01.182
Hey, come on.

42:01.577 --> 42:02.658
You look good.

42:02.817 --> 42:06.344
I'm ugly, Greg!
I'm so ugly.

42:06.857 --> 42:08.985
Everyone feels like
they have to lie to me and no one

42:09.097 --> 42:11.065
realizes how insulting that is.

42:11.497 --> 42:13.818
Everyone thinks they're
helping, and they're not.

42:29.857 --> 42:31.018
Here.

42:31.937 --> 42:33.177
That one's called <i>Mono Rash.</i>

42:33.257 --> 42:35.225
It's based on <i>Rashomon</i>
by Kurosawa.

42:35.377 --> 42:36.977
Plot's basically
just Earl killing people

42:37.017 --> 42:38.178
'cause he has a rash...

42:38.337 --> 42:40.578
...from mono,
you know, the STD.

42:42.577 --> 42:45.421
Anyway, we're supposed
to go work on

42:45.537 --> 42:47.539
our homage to <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

42:47.697 --> 42:49.699
Ours is called
<i>A Box O' Lips, Wow,</i>

42:49.777 --> 42:51.137
which is even worse
than <i>Mono Rash.</i>

42:52.137 --> 42:54.060
It's a war movie
where these two guys

42:54.137 --> 42:55.707
take part in the unspeakable
brutality of war...

42:55.857 --> 42:57.985
...and then they find
a box of tulips.

42:58.137 --> 43:00.299
Box O' Lips, yeah.
And they're just, "Wow."

43:00.457 --> 43:02.539
They can't get over
how great these tulips are,

43:02.617 --> 43:04.221
it's like,
"A box o' lips, wow!"

43:05.377 --> 43:06.737
The worst part is,
tulips might not

43:06.777 --> 43:08.427
even be in the budget anymore.

43:10.657 --> 43:11.783
I should actually just stay here

43:11.897 --> 43:13.308
and keep you from watching that.

43:13.737 --> 43:16.263
No! I'm fine. Go make it.

43:16.377 --> 43:17.378
Okay.

43:19.937 --> 43:21.587
Okay. Have fun watching

43:21.657 --> 43:23.625
this incredibly terrible movie.

43:23.817 --> 43:25.660
Mmm. Have fun

43:25.737 --> 43:27.148
making the next one.
Mmm-hmm.

43:50.177 --> 43:51.588
Hey, white boy!

43:51.777 --> 43:53.700
Why don't you make me
a tulip 'fore I have Doopie come down

43:53.777 --> 43:55.620
there and eat your face?

43:56.417 --> 43:58.340
But no, for real.
Can you make me a tulip?

43:58.537 --> 44:00.107
Oh, my God!
Am I on set right now?

44:00.257 --> 44:01.588
Oh, damn!
Oh, my God!

44:01.657 --> 44:04.661
Ahh! I can't take it!
Action! Cut!

44:05.617 --> 44:07.619
Madison, why are you here?

44:07.777 --> 44:09.222
Rachel said that
I could find you here...

44:09.377 --> 44:10.981
...and your phone was going
straight to voice mail.

44:11.177 --> 44:13.179
Probably 'cause there ain't
no good service down there!

44:13.337 --> 44:15.180
But I had to get here
'cause I had to let you know.

44:15.337 --> 44:17.817
So, I was visiting Rachel,
and I was giving her a card...

44:18.017 --> 44:20.338
...and she was watching
one of your secret movies.

44:20.497 --> 44:21.828
Oh, my God.
Wait, did you see any of it?

44:22.017 --> 44:23.497
No! No, she turned it
off immediately.

44:23.617 --> 44:24.857
It was good, it was good.

44:24.977 --> 44:26.138
You know,
you're both Japanese, and...

44:26.297 --> 44:27.981
...Earl beheaded you,
and, but then,

44:28.057 --> 44:29.343
she, like, turned it off.

44:29.497 --> 44:31.818
But I had a brainstorm. Okay?
I had an amazing brainstorm.

44:31.977 --> 44:35.743
I realized... you need to
make a film for Rachel.

44:37.017 --> 44:38.348
What do you think?

44:39.057 --> 44:40.821
It would be like her favorite
thing in the entire world...

44:40.977 --> 44:43.137
...and it's like the most
important thing you could do.

44:43.737 --> 44:45.307
You have to do it.

44:49.257 --> 44:50.383
Yeah, word.

44:50.537 --> 44:53.188
"Word"? Like, word,
you'll do it, word?

45:00.817 --> 45:01.864
Yep.

45:02.057 --> 45:03.058
Oh, my God, awesome!

45:03.217 --> 45:04.423
Okay, well,
I can't wait to see it.

45:04.577 --> 45:06.067
Um, okay, I gotta go, but...

45:07.017 --> 45:08.064
Cut!

45:08.857 --> 45:10.063
That's a wrap!

45:10.497 --> 45:11.498
Rolling!

45:12.497 --> 45:13.544
Titties.

45:13.737 --> 45:15.262
Goddamn it!

45:15.857 --> 45:17.097
<i>In the next few weeks,</i>

45:17.177 --> 45:19.179
<i>did I start
making that movie? No.</i>

45:19.337 --> 45:21.385
<i>Because I didn't agree
to make that movie.</i>

45:21.537 --> 45:23.460
<i>All I said was, "Word."</i>

45:23.617 --> 45:25.267
<i>"Word" could mean anything.</i>

45:25.457 --> 45:26.788
<i>Plus, we had at least
a month or two...</i>

45:26.937 --> 45:28.098
<i>...before she'd ran through</i>

45:28.177 --> 45:30.179
<i>all the terrible films
we'd already made.</i>

45:30.377 --> 45:32.698
<i>For example,</i>
A Sockwork Orange.

45:58.817 --> 46:00.057
"Droogle"?

46:01.257 --> 46:03.259
It's Google for droogs.

46:04.217 --> 46:05.218
What's that?

46:05.897 --> 46:07.945
Nothing, just the bane
of my existence.

46:09.617 --> 46:11.257
Which my mom is forcing me
to carry around

46:11.337 --> 46:13.066
until I apply
to some colleges.

46:14.457 --> 46:15.982
She says it's like a menu

46:16.057 --> 46:17.058
for my future,
and I was, like, "Sure.

46:17.257 --> 46:19.225
"A menu that only has food

46:19.297 --> 46:21.345
"that will humiliate me
for four years."

46:21.497 --> 46:24.626
You have to be less
of an idiot about college.

46:25.137 --> 46:27.344
Listen, even if you think
people won't like you...

46:27.497 --> 46:30.421
...which is literally
an insane thing to think...

46:30.577 --> 46:32.306
...you're way less exposed
to people in college.

46:32.457 --> 46:35.108
High school is 40 hours
of class a week.

46:35.257 --> 46:37.783
College is, like, 15 and 20.

46:37.937 --> 46:39.302
And if you don't want to
live with other people,

46:39.417 --> 46:41.818
then go to Pittsburgh State.

46:41.977 --> 46:43.627
Live at home.

46:43.817 --> 46:46.468
It's better than
sitting college out

46:46.537 --> 46:48.187
because you irrationally
hate yourself.

46:48.617 --> 46:50.540
Not irrationally, though.

46:50.697 --> 46:52.267
Apply to Pittsburgh State.

46:53.097 --> 46:55.304
Right now. Apply early.

46:55.937 --> 46:59.180
Come on. Do it in front of me.
Apply to Pittsburgh State.

46:59.337 --> 47:00.623
What if I say no?

47:02.297 --> 47:04.504
I have stage four cancer.

47:06.337 --> 47:08.658
So that would be a pretty
dick move. Come on.

47:08.817 --> 47:09.978
Fine.

47:16.737 --> 47:20.901
"Why I want to
go... to college."

47:25.137 --> 47:27.139
By Werner Herzog.

47:28.577 --> 47:29.817
The highly selective

47:29.897 --> 47:31.422
admissions process...

47:31.577 --> 47:34.387
...weeds out the cruel
and the stupid.

47:34.537 --> 47:37.746
So college is unlike
the senseless chaos...

47:37.897 --> 47:41.504
...and sickening enormity
of high school.

47:41.657 --> 47:45.059
High school is the mouth
of a great demon...

47:45.217 --> 47:46.867
...biting and chewing

47:47.017 --> 47:48.667
and smushing people in the face.

47:49.857 --> 47:52.667
It is simply overwhelming.

47:56.057 --> 47:57.866
In all seriousness,

47:57.937 --> 47:59.541
I am looking forward
to college...

47:59.737 --> 48:02.502
...because I didn't really
fit in in high school,

48:02.617 --> 48:03.664
because of my weird
rodent face...

48:03.737 --> 48:04.784
No.

48:04.857 --> 48:07.861
...and a habit of saying
the dumbest possible shit.

48:08.017 --> 48:09.018
No!

48:09.177 --> 48:11.942
The sheer pastiness
of my complexion...

48:12.097 --> 48:16.182
...overwhelms all who behold
it with existential nausea.

48:16.377 --> 48:21.258
"In high school, I never
truly felt comfortable...

48:21.617 --> 48:22.903
"...in my own skin.

48:23.057 --> 48:25.025
"In fact,
I've always been someone...

48:25.217 --> 48:28.858
"...who doesn't
really like themselves.

48:29.617 --> 48:33.588
"But I think that's because I
have some growing up to do...

48:33.737 --> 48:38.265
"...and college is the place
where I'm going to do it."

48:41.377 --> 48:42.708
That's way too personal.

48:42.857 --> 48:44.188
It's a personal essay.

48:46.897 --> 48:48.377
Fine, if you want to
see this again...

48:48.457 --> 48:50.266
Okay! Okay!

48:51.017 --> 48:53.463
But only because cancer.

48:54.177 --> 48:57.181
And you know what?
You have to do this too now.
Here.

48:57.857 --> 48:59.541
Page through this huge,
horrible book

48:59.617 --> 49:00.778
and find some colleges.

49:00.937 --> 49:02.223
That's yours now.

49:03.257 --> 49:05.578
Mmm. It's like a menu
for your future.

49:09.777 --> 49:11.506
Can I finish my movie first?

49:33.777 --> 49:39.341
<i>I'll find a place
somewhere in the corner</i>

49:41.457 --> 49:46.861
<i>I'm gonna waste
the rest of my days</i>

49:49.017 --> 49:54.786
<i>Just watching patiently
from the window</i>

49:56.817 --> 50:00.981
<i>Just waiting
Seasons change someday</i>

50:01.057 --> 50:02.946
<i>Oh, oh, my dreams will pull you</i>

50:03.017 --> 50:04.462
<i>Through that garden gate</i>

50:04.537 --> 50:09.703
<i>I want to be
the wandering sailor</i>

50:12.217 --> 50:17.587
<i>We're silhouettes
by the light of the moon</i>

50:19.817 --> 50:24.345
<i>I sit playing solitaire
by the window</i>

50:27.657 --> 50:31.707
<i>Just waiting Seasons change, aha</i>

50:31.817 --> 50:33.148
<i>You'll see, one day</i>

50:33.217 --> 50:35.504
<i>These dreams will pull you
through my door</i>

50:35.577 --> 50:40.026
<i>And I'll come running
to tie your shoe</i>

50:43.537 --> 50:48.862
<i>I'll come running
to tie your shoe</i>

50:51.217 --> 50:55.859
<i>I'll come running
to tie your shoe</i>

50:59.017 --> 51:03.864
<i>I'll come running
to tie your shoe</i>

51:33.057 --> 51:34.900
So,
if we make this film,

51:34.977 --> 51:36.058
people are gonna be, like:

51:36.417 --> 51:37.498
"Oh, Greg and Earl,

51:37.577 --> 51:39.067
"they're those weird filmmakers.

51:39.217 --> 51:40.901
"They're always
creepily filming stuff.

51:41.057 --> 51:42.627
"They'll probably sneak into
your house one night

51:42.737 --> 51:43.943
"and film you
while you're sleeping."

51:44.057 --> 51:45.422
But people probably
already think that,

51:45.497 --> 51:46.498
'cause you gave Rachel
those stupid films.

51:46.577 --> 51:47.578
This is nasty as hell.

51:47.657 --> 51:49.341
So now, I've become
completely conspicuous,

51:49.417 --> 51:50.578
like all the time.

51:50.737 --> 51:51.943
People look at me and think,

51:52.057 --> 51:53.183
"Filmmaker."
The hell even is this?

51:53.297 --> 51:54.298
When they're not
already thinking,

51:54.417 --> 51:55.457
"Cancer girl's boyfriend."

51:55.497 --> 51:56.783
It tastes like a dog's
funky-ass butthole.

51:56.897 --> 51:58.058
Furthermore,
we agreed to do a film

51:58.137 --> 51:59.787
that we have no idea
what it should look like...

51:59.937 --> 52:01.746
...or sound like, or even be.

52:01.817 --> 52:03.023
I mean,
what the hell sort of film

52:03.097 --> 52:05.179
should we even make? Huh?

52:05.257 --> 52:07.066
I mean, what was I thinking?

52:07.137 --> 52:08.263
You were thinking
that girl Madison

52:08.337 --> 52:09.463
had nice titties.

52:09.577 --> 52:10.817
I mean,
I like the titties too,

52:10.937 --> 52:12.507
but now you got a problem.

52:12.577 --> 52:14.181
'Cause I ain't agreed
to do this shit.

52:14.257 --> 52:15.304
You did.

52:16.817 --> 52:18.945
Are you not gonna
help me make this?

52:19.017 --> 52:20.746
The hell we gonna make, son?

52:20.817 --> 52:23.297
<i>They want fresh inspiration.</i>

52:23.457 --> 52:25.017
I must tell you,
the richest inspiration

52:25.097 --> 52:26.667
I have ever known was...

52:26.817 --> 52:29.104
...during my period of
quarantine in the Amazon.

52:30.657 --> 52:32.341
Where I
and a half dozen other...

52:32.457 --> 52:34.619
...unfortunates
had nothing to watch...

52:34.777 --> 52:38.498
...but the bristling,
leviathan tarantula...

52:38.657 --> 52:41.786
...bunched up on
the rotting, flimsy thatch...

52:41.977 --> 52:43.979
...perhaps eight feet
above our faces.

52:44.537 --> 52:47.302
Spiders the size of your fist.

52:47.457 --> 52:49.983
Their fangs glistening
with venom and...

52:50.137 --> 52:51.866
...their thousand-fold
black eyes

52:51.977 --> 52:54.184
shining dully in the gloom.

52:54.337 --> 52:55.623
In the darkness,
you would hear

52:55.697 --> 52:57.142
the sudden anguished hiss...

52:57.297 --> 53:00.380
...of a spider being struck
by an adult leopard wasp...

53:00.577 --> 53:01.703
...and in their
mortal struggle,

53:01.817 --> 53:03.137
they would plummet
to one's bed...

53:03.217 --> 53:06.187
...biting and stinging
and thrashing...

53:07.737 --> 53:09.899
You know that you can
smoke a hornet?

53:11.137 --> 53:13.538
Okay, so just look at me
when you answer the questions.

53:13.657 --> 53:15.898
Don't worry
about the camera, all right?

53:16.977 --> 53:18.741
Okay, Denise.

53:18.817 --> 53:20.660
Tell me a little
about Rachel's birth.

53:21.577 --> 53:23.386
Uh, Rachel's birth.

53:23.817 --> 53:25.421
What an ordeal that was.

53:27.737 --> 53:30.661
Greg, just...
let me tell you one thing.

53:31.737 --> 53:33.387
I was a really good mom
to her, you know?

53:33.497 --> 53:35.022
I really was.

53:35.217 --> 53:37.538
Some single moms,
their kids grow up too fast...

53:37.697 --> 53:39.381
...but I always tried to
protect Rachel from that.

53:39.537 --> 53:42.063
I did my very best
to protect her from...

53:43.777 --> 53:45.700
...growing up too quickly,
you know?

53:47.457 --> 53:48.538
Right.

53:48.617 --> 53:50.858
And now, I'm learning
that there are...

53:52.617 --> 53:53.698
...there are just
some things that you can't

53:53.777 --> 53:55.825
protect your kid from,
you know?

53:57.377 --> 53:59.618
No matter what you do,
you just...

54:06.177 --> 54:08.862
So, did she have
any favorite toys?

54:09.377 --> 54:11.539
Before I answer that question,
this is serious...

54:13.337 --> 54:15.988
...so use your ears
and listen to me.

54:17.057 --> 54:18.468
I want you
to promise me something

54:18.537 --> 54:19.868
as I care about you.

54:20.017 --> 54:21.746
You gotta promise me you're
not gonna have a baby...

54:21.857 --> 54:22.824
...unless you're
ready to love

54:22.897 --> 54:24.337
that baby's mother
your whole life...

54:24.377 --> 54:25.378
...and this is serious.

54:25.537 --> 54:28.859
I'm telling you something
that nobody's gonna tell you.

54:29.017 --> 54:32.339
Don't pick a girl
who's push-pull, you know?

54:32.417 --> 54:35.148
You wanna pick somebody
who's gonna love you...

54:35.817 --> 54:38.058
...and not forget you,
and not...

54:38.257 --> 54:41.386
...leave you for someone
with a big, fat ass.

54:41.977 --> 54:43.900
So, no favorite toy.

54:44.497 --> 54:45.498
Um...

54:46.177 --> 54:48.498
Oh, you want to know what?
Here's a favorite toy.

54:48.577 --> 54:49.578
Scissors.

54:49.737 --> 54:51.580
When Rachel's father
first left...

54:51.737 --> 54:53.262
...she gathered up
all his books,

54:53.337 --> 54:54.338
favorite old books...

54:54.417 --> 54:57.102
...and she rounded 'em up
and she cut them right up.

54:57.217 --> 54:58.343
Please, don't tell her
I'm telling you,

54:58.417 --> 54:59.782
she would chop my head off.

54:59.937 --> 55:02.622
But she just...

55:02.697 --> 55:04.426
And I was, like,
"Atta girl."

55:04.617 --> 55:07.780
Snip, snip, snip.
She was very mad.

55:07.937 --> 55:10.178
Can we take a little break
and have a little taste?

55:10.257 --> 55:11.782
You boys are old enough
to have a little taste, right?

55:11.897 --> 55:14.468
Can we take a teeny break,
just have a little taste?

55:16.017 --> 55:18.623
Oh, yeah, that's a good boy.

55:18.777 --> 55:21.462
Greg, will you join us?

55:21.577 --> 55:23.067
Oh, I'm okay.

55:23.137 --> 55:25.617
Oh, come on,
don't be a party pooper!

55:25.697 --> 55:27.062
All right, all right.

55:28.417 --> 55:30.943
Now we can get back
to our interview.

55:31.737 --> 55:32.977
So, basically,
this whole setup

55:33.057 --> 55:34.183
is so that, you know...

55:34.257 --> 55:36.066
...I can talk to you,
you can talk to me...

55:36.137 --> 55:38.378
...and I can see you,
and you can see me.

55:38.537 --> 55:39.823
Except it's not really me,
it's a phone.

55:39.977 --> 55:41.820
And I know that
sounds kind of weird,

55:41.897 --> 55:43.228
but it's not.

55:43.457 --> 55:46.381
So, anyway, just treat it
like a get-well card,

55:46.497 --> 55:47.942
you can look into the lens.

55:48.097 --> 55:49.508
And, uh...

55:49.657 --> 55:51.421
Yeah, it's a video,
so you know...

55:51.577 --> 55:52.658
...don't think about it
too hard,

55:52.777 --> 55:54.427
but just make it good.

55:54.577 --> 55:55.988
Start whenever you're ready.

55:56.137 --> 55:57.343
Hi, Rachel.

55:57.497 --> 55:59.898
I guess I don't really
know you that well...

56:00.057 --> 56:02.264
...but I believe in you.
You can do it.

56:02.417 --> 56:03.987
That's real nice, yo.

56:04.177 --> 56:06.100
It's so sweet
that your boyfriend

56:06.177 --> 56:07.667
is doing this for you.

56:07.817 --> 56:09.148
He must really love you.

56:09.297 --> 56:11.345
Girl, that ain't
her boyfriend.

56:11.457 --> 56:12.458
Oh.

56:12.617 --> 56:14.858
<i>I know you're Jewish,
but I just wanted you to know</i>

56:14.977 --> 56:16.786
<i>that God has a plan for you.</i>

56:16.937 --> 56:18.098
<i>You seem like
a really cool person.</i>

56:18.177 --> 56:19.508
<i>I know we don't really talk.</i>

56:19.697 --> 56:22.701
<i>But you've got
a lot of friends. And, uh...</i>

56:22.857 --> 56:23.858
<i>Out of all the people
in this school,</i>

56:23.937 --> 56:25.507
<i>I don't hate you.</i>

56:26.097 --> 56:28.338
<i>I believe in you
and you can do it.</i>

56:28.977 --> 56:30.183
<i>You can do it.</i>

56:30.537 --> 56:32.187
<i>I believe in you.</i>

56:32.697 --> 56:34.028
<i>You can do it.</i>

56:34.177 --> 56:35.542
Damn.

56:46.457 --> 56:49.620
<i>Everybody's talking at me</i>

56:50.697 --> 56:54.383
<i>I don't hear a word
they're saying</i>

56:54.497 --> 56:59.059
<i>Only the echoes of my mind</i>

57:00.737 --> 57:02.148
So again,

57:02.217 --> 57:04.060
<i>if this was a touching,
romantic story...</i>

57:04.177 --> 57:05.986
<i>...we'd obviously fall in love</i>

57:06.057 --> 57:07.900
<i>and she'd say all the wise,
beautiful things...</i>

57:08.017 --> 57:08.984
<i>...that can only be learned</i>

57:09.057 --> 57:11.059
<i>in life's twilight or whatever.</i>

57:11.217 --> 57:13.345
<i>And then she'd die in my arms.</i>

57:18.417 --> 57:20.818
<i>But again,
that's not what happened.</i>

57:20.977 --> 57:24.424
<i>She just got quieter.
And unhappier.</i>

57:25.417 --> 57:27.101
So, how are you?

57:28.177 --> 57:29.508
For real.

57:30.897 --> 57:32.262
For real?

57:33.697 --> 57:35.938
Feeling like
you might have been right.

57:39.257 --> 57:40.588
Right when?

57:41.737 --> 57:43.421
Back in October.

57:44.257 --> 57:46.703
When you thought
I was dying.

57:52.617 --> 57:55.188
Well, I mean,
I regret thinking that.

57:57.257 --> 57:58.782
Don't regret it.

58:19.057 --> 58:20.741
What is that noise?

58:20.937 --> 58:22.939
It's Regretful Polar Bear.

58:25.817 --> 58:27.387
Polar Bears have
the purest expression

58:27.457 --> 58:29.425
of regret in the animal kingdom.

58:30.657 --> 58:33.979
Just listen to how haunting
and plaintive they sound.

58:36.817 --> 58:40.219
Don't make me laugh.
Please. It kinda hurts.

58:41.817 --> 58:42.978
All right.

58:53.257 --> 58:55.658
Kind of a monster
silence in here.

58:58.137 --> 58:59.184
Yeah.

59:01.337 --> 59:03.988
It's okay to just be silent
for a while.

59:06.617 --> 59:08.028
<i>Look,</i>

59:08.137 --> 59:09.866
<i>I know you're really
bracing for this sweet girl...</i>

59:09.977 --> 59:12.298
<i>...that you probably
like a lot to die.</i>

59:12.457 --> 59:16.178
<i>Just please bear with me.
She doesn't. She gets better.</i>

59:16.337 --> 59:17.782
<i>I promise.</i>

59:56.897 --> 59:59.218
<i>Pretty much all I remember
from that winter...</i>

59:59.377 --> 01:00:00.981
<i>...is working on
that stupid film...</i>

01:00:01.137 --> 01:00:02.218
<i>...just trying
to make something</i>

01:00:02.297 --> 01:00:04.186
<i>that made some kind of sense...</i>

01:00:04.377 --> 01:00:06.061
<i>...and knowing the whole time
that I couldn't...</i>

01:00:06.217 --> 01:00:07.264
<i>...that maybe it was possible</i>

01:00:07.377 --> 01:00:09.425
<i>to make the thing
we wanted to make...</i>

01:00:09.577 --> 01:00:11.545
<i>...but it wasn't
possible for us.</i>

01:00:12.737 --> 01:00:15.502
<i>That was
an entire winter of my life.</i>

01:00:19.737 --> 01:00:20.818
<i>I mean, obviously,</i>

01:00:20.937 --> 01:00:22.587
<i>I remember visiting Rachel too.</i>

01:00:24.897 --> 01:00:25.944
<i>Sometimes she talked,</i>

01:00:26.017 --> 01:00:28.338
<i>and sometimes,
she didn't want to.</i>

01:00:29.337 --> 01:00:31.339
<i>When she didn't want to,
I talked.</i>

01:00:31.497 --> 01:00:33.340
<i>Or we watched movies.</i>

01:00:33.737 --> 01:00:34.943
<i>Sometimes, she laughed.</i>

01:00:36.537 --> 01:00:38.107
<i>Sometimes, she didn't.</i>

01:00:43.617 --> 01:00:46.587
<i>What I don't remember
is doing schoolwork.</i>

01:00:48.777 --> 01:00:51.462
<i>I did literally zero
schoolwork during this time.</i>

01:00:57.897 --> 01:00:58.944
<i>Not figuratively.</i>

01:00:59.857 --> 01:01:02.622
<i>Literally zero schoolwork.</i>

01:01:06.737 --> 01:01:09.104
<i>That's actually
sort of hard to do.</i>

01:01:28.337 --> 01:01:30.465
So, what's going on at school?

01:01:32.777 --> 01:01:35.064
Well, right now,
the whole school looks like a castle...

01:01:35.177 --> 01:01:37.339
...'cause everyone's
getting ready

01:01:37.417 --> 01:01:38.782
for Medieval Prom.

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:44.026
I guess everyone's trying
to figure out how to, like...

01:01:44.097 --> 01:01:45.428
...twerk medievally?

01:01:47.257 --> 01:01:48.497
Are you going?

01:01:48.657 --> 01:01:49.863
No, of course not.

01:01:50.017 --> 01:01:51.507
You should go.

01:01:51.657 --> 01:01:53.182
No way!

01:01:53.937 --> 01:01:55.939
Have you seen me in a tux?

01:01:57.337 --> 01:01:59.943
It's like when they make
a dog wear human clothes.

01:02:00.017 --> 01:02:01.178
Have you seen that?

01:02:01.337 --> 01:02:04.147
It just makes you
really sad to look at.

01:02:06.697 --> 01:02:09.462
Oh, and I don't have
anyone to go with.

01:02:09.537 --> 01:02:10.823
So there's that.

01:02:15.977 --> 01:02:17.183
Unless...

01:02:17.697 --> 01:02:19.347
...you know...
you wanted to...

01:02:19.497 --> 01:02:21.340
Greg, I'm not going to prom.

01:02:21.497 --> 01:02:23.226
I mean, you totally could.

01:02:23.337 --> 01:02:25.544
It could be like a,
s-, awesome statement.

01:02:25.857 --> 01:02:27.143
Hey, uh...

01:02:27.217 --> 01:02:30.346
When are you guys
finishing your movie?

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:35.504
You don't know
we're working on a movie right now.

01:02:36.057 --> 01:02:37.468
You don't have to pretend.

01:02:37.537 --> 01:02:40.586
Earl told me you guys
were making a movie for me.

01:02:43.057 --> 01:02:44.582
God, yeah...

01:02:45.737 --> 01:02:47.546
I guess he probably did.

01:02:48.377 --> 01:02:49.537
I was just asking, because...

01:02:49.657 --> 01:02:51.227
Goddamn it, Earl! Ugh.

01:02:51.417 --> 01:02:54.068
It was just, it was
supposed to be a surprise!

01:02:54.737 --> 01:02:56.501
You know?
It's taking forever

01:02:56.577 --> 01:02:57.817
because we really want
to get it right, and...

01:02:57.897 --> 01:03:01.219
I'm probably gonna
stop treatment pretty soon.

01:03:06.017 --> 01:03:07.098
What?

01:03:11.097 --> 01:03:13.020
It just isn't
doing me any good.

01:03:13.097 --> 01:03:15.418
All it's doing
is making me sicker.

01:03:23.937 --> 01:03:26.417
Yeah, but it...
I mean, if you stop, then...

01:03:26.617 --> 01:03:28.699
Well, we'll just
see what happens.

01:03:30.377 --> 01:03:32.857
Well, we know
what's gonna happen, right?

01:03:45.297 --> 01:03:47.459
I know who
you can take to prom.

01:03:50.417 --> 01:03:51.464
Who?

01:03:53.897 --> 01:03:55.308
This sexy pillow here.

01:03:55.377 --> 01:03:56.417
Oh, my God, can you just...

01:03:56.457 --> 01:03:58.141
Ooh, Greg,

01:03:58.257 --> 01:03:59.304
this pillow's name is Francesca.

01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:00.663
Don't joke,
I can't deal with that.

01:04:00.737 --> 01:04:01.818
She's a filthy Italian woman.

01:04:01.897 --> 01:04:02.898
Please, stop!

01:04:04.577 --> 01:04:06.102
Don't yell at me.

01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:07.901
So, that's it?
Just, to hell with college,

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:08.978
to hell with growing up?

01:04:09.057 --> 01:04:10.058
Greg, don't.

01:04:10.137 --> 01:04:11.741
Rachel, what the hell
is wrong with you?

01:04:11.817 --> 01:04:13.501
This is your life!

01:04:14.577 --> 01:04:16.659
Yeah, it is my life.

01:04:17.337 --> 01:04:19.738
It's me who has to
lie in bed all day,

01:04:19.817 --> 01:04:20.898
with a shaved head...

01:04:20.977 --> 01:04:22.741
...getting weaker and uglier,

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:25.900
and more miserable,
with no hope in sight.

01:04:26.337 --> 01:04:28.101
I'm the one who
has to suffer through this,

01:04:28.177 --> 01:04:30.418
not you, so don't yell at me.

01:04:32.777 --> 01:04:34.939
I'm sorry,
but I'm not gonna sit here

01:04:35.017 --> 01:04:37.304
and get comfortable
watching you die.

01:04:39.017 --> 01:04:41.463
Okay? I'm not.
I'm not gonna do that.

01:04:41.817 --> 01:04:43.660
So don't ask me to.

01:04:44.497 --> 01:04:46.340
If you can't accept
that I'm going to do

01:04:46.417 --> 01:04:48.863
what I want to do
with my life...

01:04:49.857 --> 01:04:51.780
...then you're
a terrible friend.

01:04:53.337 --> 01:04:54.987
I'm a terrible friend?

01:04:55.137 --> 01:04:56.184
Okay.

01:04:56.777 --> 01:04:58.188
You know,
I'm not the one giving up.

01:04:58.337 --> 01:04:59.702
I'm not ruining my friend's life

01:04:59.817 --> 01:05:01.307
by giving up
on the whole world.

01:05:01.377 --> 01:05:03.300
Oh, please, Greg,
you should be overjoyed.

01:05:03.377 --> 01:05:04.617
Now you can
go back to your life

01:05:04.697 --> 01:05:07.143
of being invisible
and detached...

01:05:07.217 --> 01:05:09.026
...and self-hating.

01:05:11.537 --> 01:05:12.663
Yeah.

01:05:13.777 --> 01:05:16.144
And you can go back
to your life of being dead.

01:05:18.217 --> 01:05:20.219
Nice. Really nice.

01:05:26.057 --> 01:05:28.025
This is gonna kill your mom.

01:05:31.697 --> 01:05:33.859
Have you gotten
comfortable with that?

01:05:37.737 --> 01:05:39.819
That doesn't
bother you anymore?

01:05:39.897 --> 01:05:40.978
Thinking about your mom?

01:05:41.057 --> 01:05:42.821
Get outta here, Greg.
You've done your time.

01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:45.178
You don't have to hang around
with the sick girl anymore.

01:05:49.577 --> 01:05:51.579
How can you even
say that to me?

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:55.228
Your mom forced you
to hang out with me.

01:05:55.377 --> 01:05:56.947
Earl forced you
to show me your movies.

01:05:57.057 --> 01:05:59.185
Madison forced you
to make a movie about me.

01:05:59.257 --> 01:06:01.942
So, what part of this
did you actually want to do?

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:24.228
Just... Just do something
nice for me for once

01:06:24.297 --> 01:06:26.106
and just get out.

01:06:51.657 --> 01:06:52.818
<i>Earl!</i>

01:06:53.137 --> 01:06:55.504
This is it!
You've gone too far!

01:06:55.657 --> 01:06:56.897
You've leaked
the unleakable secret

01:06:56.977 --> 01:06:58.502
because you hold nothing sacred.

01:06:58.617 --> 01:06:59.664
'Cause you're a dickhead!

01:06:59.777 --> 01:07:00.824
The foundation of any

01:07:00.937 --> 01:07:02.541
good working partnership
is trust...

01:07:02.617 --> 01:07:04.426
...and I can no longer
trust you in any way.

01:07:04.497 --> 01:07:05.737
You'll leak anything to anyone.

01:07:05.817 --> 01:07:07.421
It's like working
with Julian Assange.

01:07:07.497 --> 01:07:09.659
Assangde. Ass-andge.
Damn it!

01:07:23.137 --> 01:07:24.502
The hell you want?

01:07:24.937 --> 01:07:26.860
Just waiting for Earl.
Awright, awright.

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:29.102
Whassup, boy?
You gonna come in?

01:07:29.257 --> 01:07:31.339
So, Rachel told me that
you told her about the, uh...

01:07:31.697 --> 01:07:33.267
...about the film
that we're making for her.

01:07:33.337 --> 01:07:34.338
Yeah?

01:07:34.977 --> 01:07:36.945
You're like Julian Assange, man.

01:07:37.097 --> 01:07:38.462
It's like you always do this...

01:07:38.537 --> 01:07:39.737
I don't know,
'cause you, like,

01:07:39.777 --> 01:07:41.381
wanna be a better friend
than me or something?

01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:42.618
I don't know if I can
work with you again

01:07:42.697 --> 01:07:43.903
after you sell me out
like a dick!

01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:46.298
Oh, okay. Watch out, yo.

01:07:47.217 --> 01:07:49.219
Hey, yo,
shut your ass up, man!

01:07:49.297 --> 01:07:50.867
Like you care so much about
what other people think,

01:07:50.977 --> 01:07:52.138
boy, you go around here...

01:07:52.217 --> 01:07:53.298
...kissin' everybody ass,

01:07:53.377 --> 01:07:54.458
pretending like
they your friend.

01:07:54.537 --> 01:07:56.858
Look, nobody
gives a shit about you, Greg!

01:07:57.017 --> 01:07:58.143
All right? Nobody give a shit!

01:07:58.217 --> 01:07:59.218
Whoop his ass!

01:07:59.337 --> 01:08:01.783
And then the one girl
who do actually care about you...

01:08:01.897 --> 01:08:02.978
...you wanna come
over here and

01:08:03.057 --> 01:08:05.537
bitch and whine
about some films, yo? Huh?

01:08:05.657 --> 01:08:08.058
Because somebody
actually cares about you?

01:08:08.137 --> 01:08:09.468
Like, damn,
I'm so tired of you

01:08:09.537 --> 01:08:11.221
treating this girl
like she a burden.

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:13.305
You know,
her life is over after this!

01:08:13.377 --> 01:08:14.537
And you want to
come over here

01:08:14.577 --> 01:08:17.308
bitchin' and whinin' about
some irrelevant bullshit!

01:08:17.377 --> 01:08:19.823
Like, yo, you so close to me
knocking your shit loose right now, son!

01:08:19.897 --> 01:08:20.978
Go for it!

01:08:21.057 --> 01:08:22.138
Oh, so you want me
to hit you now? Huh?

01:08:22.216 --> 01:08:24.140
Yeah, I don't care!
You want me to hit you now?

01:08:24.216 --> 01:08:25.577
Yeah, Earl, I want you to!

01:08:25.857 --> 01:08:27.904
That's right! Jack that
little dude up there!

01:08:33.417 --> 01:08:34.497
See, Greg?

01:08:34.577 --> 01:08:36.898
You lucky that was him
and not me out there...

01:08:37.017 --> 01:08:39.179
...'cause I'd have been whooping
your ass up and down this street.

01:08:39.256 --> 01:08:41.457
It'd have been a ass-whoopin'
fest around here, you dig?

01:08:50.337 --> 01:08:53.863
So what's the status on
the 20-pager on Nixon?

01:08:54.937 --> 01:08:58.100
Uh, I need another extension.

01:08:58.256 --> 01:09:00.497
That might prove difficult...

01:09:00.617 --> 01:09:03.348
...seeing how it's the...

01:09:03.457 --> 01:09:05.027
...the end of the quarter
and all.

01:09:05.777 --> 01:09:08.747
Yeah, I've just been busy.

01:09:10.657 --> 01:09:12.500
You know, I heard...

01:09:15.897 --> 01:09:17.386
...about Rachel.

01:09:18.457 --> 01:09:20.060
How you holding up?

01:09:24.256 --> 01:09:25.258
You know...

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:28.062
...not great.

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:36.779
You know, my dad died
when I was 15, Greg.

01:09:37.136 --> 01:09:39.139
A couple years younger than you.

01:09:39.577 --> 01:09:42.819
You know, the thing is that,
when I was a kid...

01:09:43.457 --> 01:09:46.142
...I really,
I really can only remember

01:09:46.216 --> 01:09:48.060
thinking about him as this...

01:09:48.136 --> 01:09:51.538
...you know, big,
kind of like asshole guy.

01:09:53.017 --> 01:09:55.258
At his wake,
these buddies of his

01:09:55.337 --> 01:09:56.384
kept coming up to me...

01:09:56.457 --> 01:09:59.142
...and telling me
these stories about him.

01:09:59.337 --> 01:10:01.465
And it was like
they were talking about

01:10:01.537 --> 01:10:03.380
some complete other guy.

01:10:04.777 --> 01:10:06.586
To give you an example.

01:10:07.257 --> 01:10:10.466
He knew every single
European pop song

01:10:10.537 --> 01:10:11.868
from the 1970s.

01:10:12.017 --> 01:10:13.018
Every single one.

01:10:14.097 --> 01:10:15.337
He'd memorize these songs,

01:10:15.417 --> 01:10:17.260
and he'd do that
so he could go...

01:10:17.417 --> 01:10:20.307
...and sing them
to German girls in bars.

01:10:21.337 --> 01:10:22.623
He had a go-to,

01:10:22.697 --> 01:10:25.223
his number one
go-to song. It was a...

01:10:26.217 --> 01:10:30.427
It was a Dutch song.
It was called <i>Ding-a-Dong.</i>

01:10:32.097 --> 01:10:35.738
My dad used to sing that
to German girls in bars.

01:10:36.937 --> 01:10:38.621
That's a fact.

01:10:42.217 --> 01:10:44.026
So what does that mean?

01:10:46.457 --> 01:10:49.381
Well, Greg, I think that
it just means that...

01:10:50.417 --> 01:10:52.897
...even after somebody dies,
you can...

01:10:53.777 --> 01:10:56.098
...you can still
keep learning about them.

01:10:57.137 --> 01:10:59.868
You know, their life.

01:11:01.617 --> 01:11:04.860
It can keep unfolding
itself to you just as long...

01:11:05.817 --> 01:11:08.343
...just as long as
you pay attention to it.

01:11:09.577 --> 01:11:10.908
Are you seriously
trying to turn this

01:11:10.977 --> 01:11:13.298
into some stupid sappy lesson?

01:11:15.657 --> 01:11:17.227
You're a good kid, Greg.

01:11:17.297 --> 01:11:19.823
No! Look, I'm going home.

01:11:21.217 --> 01:11:23.823
See, I'm cutting class
right in front of you. 'Kay?

01:11:23.897 --> 01:11:26.662
I'm not a good kid. I'm not.

01:11:43.737 --> 01:11:44.738
Okay.

01:11:45.537 --> 01:11:47.665
Earl came by earlier
to drop something off...

01:11:47.737 --> 01:11:49.865
...but he turned down
this superb

01:11:49.937 --> 01:11:51.985
Andouille rabbit sausage...

01:11:52.137 --> 01:11:54.105
...which is quite unlike him.

01:11:55.137 --> 01:11:56.787
Is everything all right?

01:11:58.257 --> 01:11:59.418
Buddy?

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:17.181
<i>Hey, Rachel. Uh...</i>

01:12:18.137 --> 01:12:19.417
<i>We tried a lot of different ways</i>

01:12:19.457 --> 01:12:21.141
<i>of making a film for you...</i>

01:12:21.217 --> 01:12:24.061
<i>...but they were all
too goofy or irrelevant...</i>

01:12:24.217 --> 01:12:25.821
<i>...or just not what we wanted.</i>

01:12:25.977 --> 01:12:28.583
<i>So, now I'm gonna
talk to you directly.</i>

01:12:29.297 --> 01:12:30.298
<i>Um...</i>

01:12:30.697 --> 01:12:32.984
<i>All right, I'm gonna be
honest here. Okay?</i>

01:12:33.137 --> 01:12:35.265
<i>Sometimes, white girls
are particularly stupid.</i>

01:12:35.377 --> 01:12:39.780
<i>I mean, everybody's stupid,
but white girls, you know...</i>

01:12:39.857 --> 01:12:41.541
<i>They think
they better than everybody</i>

01:12:41.617 --> 01:12:44.223
<i>and self-centered
and pretend they not.</i>

01:12:44.297 --> 01:12:45.981
<i>But...</i>

01:12:46.097 --> 01:12:48.668
<i>You aren't like that,
you know. Um...</i>

01:12:48.737 --> 01:12:50.626
<i>It's just crazy
how patient you've been.</i>

01:12:50.697 --> 01:12:53.541
<i>You know, I know if it was me
that had cancer, uh...</i>

01:12:54.417 --> 01:12:56.738
<i>...I'd be upset and angry</i>

01:12:56.857 --> 01:12:59.337
<i>and trying to beat
everybody's ass half the time.</i>

01:12:59.777 --> 01:13:03.543
<i>So I'm just, I'm just amazed
at how patient you've been.</i>

01:13:05.857 --> 01:13:08.098
<i>You, you make me feel blessed.</i>

01:13:17.697 --> 01:13:18.983
Tales of Hoffmann <i>is a film</i>

01:13:19.057 --> 01:13:21.537
<i>by Michael Powell
and Emeric Pressburger.</i>

01:13:22.737 --> 01:13:24.577
<i>I think, ultimately,
what one has to understand</i>

01:13:24.617 --> 01:13:25.948
<i>watching this film...</i>

01:13:26.017 --> 01:13:28.827
<i>...it's a very special
piece of filmmaking.</i>

01:13:28.897 --> 01:13:29.898
Oh.

01:13:30.457 --> 01:13:32.425
Are you eating lunch
in here still?

01:13:33.377 --> 01:13:34.663
Not if you are.

01:13:35.257 --> 01:13:37.100
Well, I'm not eating
lunch in here if you are.

01:13:38.137 --> 01:13:40.663
Good, 'cause I like it in here.

01:13:41.097 --> 01:13:43.304
So I guess I could just go.

01:13:44.177 --> 01:13:45.303
Or you could go.

01:13:45.937 --> 01:13:48.668
No, I like
the air-conditioner.

01:13:48.737 --> 01:13:50.580
And I like
the comfortable chair.

01:13:54.497 --> 01:13:56.818
Yeah, I like those too.

01:13:57.697 --> 01:14:00.098
Sounds like your damn problem.

01:14:01.817 --> 01:14:04.058
<i>...which showed
one film per week...</i>

01:14:04.257 --> 01:14:07.022
<i>...twice a night,
and three times on Saturday.</i>

01:14:07.697 --> 01:14:09.745
<i>In a way,</i>
Tales of Hoffmann <i> is...</i>

01:14:10.897 --> 01:14:13.548
<i>...the culmination of
Powell-Pressburger's work...</i>

01:14:13.697 --> 01:14:16.348
<i>...with what they call
the composed film.</i>

01:14:37.697 --> 01:14:38.698
Hey!

01:14:39.177 --> 01:14:40.542
Can I talk to you
about the movie?

01:14:41.297 --> 01:14:42.378
Um...

01:14:42.457 --> 01:14:44.027
Yeah, it's not done yet.

01:14:44.217 --> 01:14:45.423
Greg, you guys
have been working on it

01:14:45.497 --> 01:14:46.908
for like four months.

01:14:48.177 --> 01:14:49.383
Yeah, well...

01:14:49.897 --> 01:14:51.183
I don't know,
we tried a bunch of stuff

01:14:51.257 --> 01:14:53.100
and it just...

01:14:53.497 --> 01:14:54.544
...didn't really work.

01:14:54.617 --> 01:14:55.657
It's not that good.

01:14:55.777 --> 01:14:56.824
Greg!

01:14:57.017 --> 01:14:59.588
Now is not the time for your
"I'm Greg, I suck,

01:14:59.657 --> 01:15:01.147
"nothing I do
is any good" thing.

01:15:01.297 --> 01:15:02.423
I'm sure what you have
is awesome

01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:04.386
and I think she would
really benefit...

01:15:04.457 --> 01:15:06.937
...if you just got it done
and gave it to her.

01:15:07.817 --> 01:15:09.785
Madison,
she stopped treatment.

01:15:12.897 --> 01:15:14.023
She gave up.

01:15:16.097 --> 01:15:17.622
She quit.

01:15:19.617 --> 01:15:20.982
Well, I guess
that's a really good reason

01:15:21.057 --> 01:15:22.582
to just finish
the fucking movie.

01:15:22.657 --> 01:15:24.102
And give it to her.

01:15:26.257 --> 01:15:27.588
But whatever.

01:15:40.537 --> 01:15:41.902
Honey?

01:15:43.577 --> 01:15:44.658
What?

01:15:50.297 --> 01:15:52.618
Rachel's back
in the hospital, honey.

01:15:56.737 --> 01:15:59.058
Wait, is she starting
treatment again?

01:16:01.417 --> 01:16:03.545
It's not for treatment, honey.

01:16:08.657 --> 01:16:09.658
Oh.

01:16:13.337 --> 01:16:14.782
Mom, what?

01:16:15.497 --> 01:16:16.828
Well, I thought
we could go and...

01:16:16.897 --> 01:16:17.978
You just thought
this was your last chance

01:16:18.057 --> 01:16:20.105
to force me
to hang out with her?

01:16:20.177 --> 01:16:21.178
Greg, come on.

01:16:21.257 --> 01:16:22.338
Don't worry, Mom,
I'm sure you can find

01:16:22.417 --> 01:16:24.704
another girl with cancer
after Rachel dies.

01:16:26.097 --> 01:16:28.020
Which, by the way...

01:16:28.377 --> 01:16:30.186
...she's decided to do.

01:16:32.297 --> 01:16:34.743
She's just decided to die...

01:16:34.817 --> 01:16:37.627
...so maybe I can decide
not to visit her.

01:16:42.977 --> 01:16:45.947
I promise you,
you will regret that...

01:16:46.097 --> 01:16:47.178
...if you don't visit her.

01:16:48.417 --> 01:16:50.226
You'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

01:16:50.377 --> 01:16:51.788
Mom, that's probably true.

01:16:51.937 --> 01:16:53.348
But honestly,
I have a shitload of things

01:16:53.417 --> 01:16:54.862
to regret right now.

01:16:55.017 --> 01:16:57.497
I regret not having a date
for tomorrow's stupid prom.

01:16:57.577 --> 01:17:00.228
I regret being too weird
to make friends.

01:17:00.377 --> 01:17:01.424
I definitely regret making

01:17:01.497 --> 01:17:02.783
all those shitty films
with Earl.

01:17:02.897 --> 01:17:05.423
And I assume you saw
the email I got today, from Pitt?

01:17:06.697 --> 01:17:07.983
Oh, no? You didn't see it

01:17:08.057 --> 01:17:09.821
while you're going though
all my shit? Here.

01:17:10.057 --> 01:17:11.627
Have a look.

01:17:11.817 --> 01:17:12.943
I'm definitely gonna regret

01:17:13.017 --> 01:17:14.940
doing literally
no school work this year!

01:17:15.257 --> 01:17:16.418
Oh, my God, Greg.

01:17:16.497 --> 01:17:18.181
I know. Admission rescinded,

01:17:18.257 --> 01:17:20.544
due to significant change
in my academic record.

01:17:20.617 --> 01:17:22.107
Oh, well,
no college next year.

01:17:22.177 --> 01:17:24.225
I guess I'll just be home,
which sucks for you...

01:17:24.297 --> 01:17:25.298
...because it's gonna be
so hard for you

01:17:25.417 --> 01:17:26.907
to go through all my stuff.

01:17:26.977 --> 01:17:28.706
Can you just do me a favor
right now, Mom?

01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:30.063
Just leave me alone. Okay?

01:17:30.137 --> 01:17:31.980
Just let me sit here
and regret stuff.

01:17:32.057 --> 01:17:33.097
I'm just gonna think about

01:17:33.177 --> 01:17:34.224
all the things
that I've ever done...

01:17:34.297 --> 01:17:35.583
...and all the things
I haven't done

01:17:35.657 --> 01:17:38.342
and just regret the living shit out of it.
Okay?

01:17:43.137 --> 01:17:45.424
All the deadlines
have passed, Victor.

01:17:45.577 --> 01:17:46.783
What's he gonna do next year?

01:17:46.897 --> 01:17:48.137
He's just gonna waste the year?

01:17:48.177 --> 01:17:49.542
He is grieving, honey.

01:17:49.617 --> 01:17:50.778
You have to let him grieve.

01:17:50.937 --> 01:17:51.938
But I can't just sit by

01:17:52.017 --> 01:17:53.382
and just let him ruin his life.

01:17:53.457 --> 01:17:54.458
That's not what I'm saying.

01:17:54.537 --> 01:17:55.538
Well, he's doing it.

01:17:55.657 --> 01:17:56.738
The universe does not operate

01:17:56.817 --> 01:17:58.626
according to a college deadline!

01:18:17.737 --> 01:18:19.017
Can I ask you something?

01:18:20.537 --> 01:18:21.538
Nope.

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:23.062
No. It's not what you think.

01:18:23.137 --> 01:18:24.263
It's just that
prom is tonight and...

01:18:24.337 --> 01:18:27.068
Let me ask you something.
What is this?

01:18:27.617 --> 01:18:29.506
What is up
with the arm touching?

01:18:29.577 --> 01:18:30.624
Are you just being friendly,

01:18:30.697 --> 01:18:31.903
or is this some
calculated maneuver...

01:18:31.977 --> 01:18:33.581
...to get me to do
whatever you want?

01:18:33.657 --> 01:18:34.704
'Cause you have to understand

01:18:34.777 --> 01:18:36.461
what it does
when a beautiful, sexy...

01:18:36.537 --> 01:18:37.737
...otherwise
thoughtful girl...

01:18:37.817 --> 01:18:39.819
...touches the arm
of a scrawny, pasty

01:18:39.897 --> 01:18:41.023
groundhog-faced kid.

01:18:41.097 --> 01:18:42.428
It's an act of cruelty.

01:18:43.297 --> 01:18:45.743
Are you done?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm done.

01:18:45.897 --> 01:18:47.308
I'm done with you.

01:18:47.417 --> 01:18:49.704
I'm done with this stupid film.

01:18:49.777 --> 01:18:51.461
All right? I'm done.

01:18:52.497 --> 01:18:53.783
Yo! But you ain't
done with me!

01:18:54.097 --> 01:18:55.701
<i>I'm back for my revenge</i>

01:18:55.777 --> 01:18:57.017
<i>Stab you in the dick</i>

01:18:57.217 --> 01:18:58.264
<i>Pardon my French</i>

01:18:58.417 --> 01:19:01.148
Really? You're gonna stab me
in the dick? Go ahead.

01:19:01.217 --> 01:19:02.218
Stab me in the dick.

01:19:02.297 --> 01:19:04.584
Just no rapping.
Okay? All right?

01:19:04.657 --> 01:19:06.944
<i>I'll break your eyeball
with a fist I got clenched</i>

01:19:08.137 --> 01:19:09.627
<i>Shove your body
under another bench</i>

01:19:09.697 --> 01:19:10.858
Stop rapping!

01:19:11.017 --> 01:19:12.860
<i>Knock your teeth out
with the fist I got clenched</i>

01:19:12.937 --> 01:19:14.937
I can't do this if you're
gonna rap the whole time.

01:19:32.617 --> 01:19:33.903
Aw!

01:19:36.497 --> 01:19:37.623
Break it up!

01:19:37.777 --> 01:19:38.778
Earl!

01:19:38.937 --> 01:19:41.258
Break it up! Break it up!

01:19:41.337 --> 01:19:42.384
I thought you were
eating lunch

01:19:42.457 --> 01:19:43.504
in Mr. McCarthy's office.

01:19:43.577 --> 01:19:44.897
Man, I was,
but he all sad talking

01:19:44.937 --> 01:19:46.057
about German music and shit.

01:19:46.137 --> 01:19:47.866
That's boring as hell, man.

01:19:47.977 --> 01:19:50.628
I'm surprised and disappointed to
see you two fighting.

01:19:50.697 --> 01:19:52.347
And, Phillip, I'm surprised
and disappointed

01:19:52.417 --> 01:19:53.828
to see you
back on school grounds...

01:19:53.977 --> 01:19:55.502
...after being expelled!

01:19:55.577 --> 01:19:56.578
All right, man.

01:19:56.657 --> 01:19:57.738
Please leave the premises.

01:19:57.817 --> 01:19:59.148
Back to class.

01:19:59.217 --> 01:20:00.378
Let's go!

01:20:00.537 --> 01:20:02.426
Maxwell, Ryan, Soledad,

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:04.738
stop gawking and start walking!

01:20:09.977 --> 01:20:11.183
Greg!

01:20:11.377 --> 01:20:13.823
Yo, babe!
You see me pummel this bitch?

01:20:13.977 --> 01:20:15.024
Come on and keep walking

01:20:15.097 --> 01:20:16.747
'fore I can whoop
that ass again, man.

01:20:16.897 --> 01:20:18.467
Madison, what?

01:20:19.297 --> 01:20:20.867
Come to prom with me.

01:20:22.937 --> 01:20:24.462
I know the whole movie situation

01:20:24.537 --> 01:20:26.107
was really difficult for you...

01:20:26.257 --> 01:20:28.225
...and I kind of feel like
it was my fault.

01:20:29.257 --> 01:20:30.258
So I just kind of wanted to

01:20:30.337 --> 01:20:31.987
make it up to you a little bit.

01:20:34.217 --> 01:20:36.106
Is this a pity date?

01:20:36.177 --> 01:20:37.178
No.

01:20:37.257 --> 01:20:38.986
No, it's not a pity date.

01:20:40.457 --> 01:20:41.822
Greg, just come to prom with me.

01:20:41.897 --> 01:20:43.342
I think we'd have a good time.

01:20:46.177 --> 01:20:48.339
Told you
you would get a date.

01:20:49.137 --> 01:20:50.138
Yep.

01:20:55.537 --> 01:20:58.780
So you're welcome.
For the tux and everything.

01:20:59.977 --> 01:21:01.342
Thanks, Mom.

01:21:16.137 --> 01:21:19.380
I'm very upset
about this college thing.

01:21:20.937 --> 01:21:22.223
But your father and I can wait

01:21:22.297 --> 01:21:24.186
till you're ready
to talk about it.

01:21:26.457 --> 01:21:27.982
I appreciate that.

01:21:30.777 --> 01:21:32.779
Don't forget your corsage.

01:21:35.817 --> 01:21:36.818
All right.

01:21:42.417 --> 01:21:44.738
My handsome boy...

01:21:44.897 --> 01:21:46.661
...going to prom.

01:21:49.297 --> 01:21:51.584
Take lots of pictures, okay?

01:22:10.257 --> 01:22:11.543
302 Halket Street.

01:22:11.817 --> 01:22:13.057
What's that?

01:22:13.217 --> 01:22:14.901
I said 302 Halket Street.

01:22:15.457 --> 01:22:18.108
Huh?
302 Halket Street.

01:22:18.257 --> 01:22:19.986
Halket? Okay.
Okay.

01:22:20.137 --> 01:22:21.548
You got it, baby.

01:22:21.697 --> 01:22:23.540
So you love this girl?

01:22:24.817 --> 01:22:27.058
Uh, no.
I wouldn't go that far.

01:22:27.337 --> 01:22:28.384
What?

01:22:28.537 --> 01:22:29.982
No. I... No.

01:22:30.177 --> 01:22:31.417
Yeah, so you guys
are gonna be getting busy

01:22:31.497 --> 01:22:33.386
on my brand new Tuscan leather?

01:22:33.537 --> 01:22:35.187
No. I think-
Huh?

01:22:35.337 --> 01:22:37.021
No, we're not.
I don't think so.

01:22:37.097 --> 01:22:39.020
Nah, I'm just playing with you.

01:22:39.177 --> 01:22:40.747
But I do hope you get some.

01:22:40.937 --> 01:22:42.985
It's really gonna depend
on what she wants to do.

01:22:43.057 --> 01:22:44.058
If you really love her,
though,

01:22:44.137 --> 01:22:45.468
you definitely got a shot.

01:22:45.617 --> 01:22:47.301
Because she'll know.

01:22:48.057 --> 01:22:49.786
She is fine though?

01:22:51.377 --> 01:22:52.378
Huh?

01:23:55.177 --> 01:23:56.338
Hey.

01:23:59.937 --> 01:24:01.507
I know, I look amazing.

01:24:06.217 --> 01:24:08.185
Can I put some flowers on you?

01:24:23.177 --> 01:24:24.861
Like that.

01:24:32.777 --> 01:24:33.858
Okay.

01:24:34.737 --> 01:24:36.785
Before we watch this...

01:24:37.297 --> 01:24:39.538
...I'm sorry
it took so long to make.

01:24:39.697 --> 01:24:41.540
But the reason is...

01:24:41.937 --> 01:24:45.259
...just couldn't figure out
how to get it to not suck.

01:24:46.217 --> 01:24:49.505
But... we never really
did figure it out.

01:24:49.577 --> 01:24:51.102
It still sucks.

01:24:51.977 --> 01:24:53.547
And, um, it's...

01:24:55.217 --> 01:24:57.948
It's not exactly
what I wanted to say to you.

01:25:04.617 --> 01:25:05.618
But...

01:25:06.937 --> 01:25:08.268
...whatever.

01:25:08.577 --> 01:25:10.739
Let's just
watch this first, okay?

01:28:24.097 --> 01:28:25.940
Hey, should I get a nurse?

01:28:27.817 --> 01:28:29.945
Denise! Denise!

01:29:41.777 --> 01:29:44.348
<i>That was the last time
I saw Rachel.</i>

01:29:45.177 --> 01:29:47.657
<i>She went into a coma
shortly after that,</i>

01:29:47.737 --> 01:29:49.341
<i>and died about 10 hours later.</i>

01:29:52.177 --> 01:29:54.544
<i>I know I told you
she doesn't die.</i>

01:29:55.057 --> 01:29:56.582
<i>And I'm sorry.</i>

01:29:57.057 --> 01:29:58.218
<i>Deep down...</i>

01:29:58.577 --> 01:30:01.581
<i>...somehow,
I didn't think she would.</i>

01:30:03.097 --> 01:30:04.622
<i>But she did.</i>

01:33:30.777 --> 01:33:32.825
<i>Dear Greg,
I heard what happened</i>

01:33:32.897 --> 01:33:34.137
<i>with your class work.</i>

01:33:34.297 --> 01:33:35.947
<i>And with Pitt State.</i>

01:33:36.497 --> 01:33:38.226
<i>So, I wrote them a letter,</i>

01:33:38.297 --> 01:33:40.504
<i>trying to convince them
to let you back in.</i>

01:33:41.177 --> 01:33:43.578
<i>There's a copy in here,
if you want to read it.</i>

01:33:44.257 --> 01:33:46.100
<i>Hopefully, it works,
because that would mean...</i>

01:33:46.177 --> 01:33:48.862
<i>...I have powers
from beyond the grave.</i>

01:33:49.017 --> 01:33:51.588
<i>But you should probably
send them something too.</i>

01:33:52.977 --> 01:33:55.947
<i>Goodbye, Greg.
You're a good friend.</i>

01:33:56.337 --> 01:33:57.623
<i>Although if you don't
go to college,</i>

01:33:57.697 --> 01:33:58.983
<i>you're also an idiot.</i>

01:33:59.137 --> 01:34:01.139
<i>But you already knew that.</i>

01:34:01.977 --> 01:34:03.308
<i>Love, Rachel.</i>

01:34:04.937 --> 01:34:08.464
<i>P.S.: I'd also like for you
to take some of my pillows.</i>

01:34:08.617 --> 01:34:11.097
<i>They'll want a good home
where they'll be loved.</i>

01:34:11.297 --> 01:34:13.379
<i>P.P.S.: Not in the way
you're thinking,</i>

01:34:13.457 --> 01:34:14.458
<i>that's disgusting.</i>

01:37:49.497 --> 01:37:51.659
<i>Dear Pittsburgh
State Admissions:</i>

01:37:51.817 --> 01:37:53.307
<i>I'm writing on behalf of someone</i>

01:37:53.377 --> 01:37:55.186
<i>who gave me
half a year of his life...</i>

01:37:55.297 --> 01:37:56.417
<i>...at the time when I was at</i>

01:37:56.457 --> 01:37:58.664
<i>my most difficult to be around.</i>

01:37:58.857 --> 01:38:00.825
<i>He has a very
low opinion of himself,</i>

01:38:00.897 --> 01:38:02.103
<i>which is why
I think it's necessary...</i>

01:38:02.177 --> 01:38:03.337
<i>...that you hear from someone</i>

01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:05.345
<i>who sees him
as he actually is:</i>

01:38:05.497 --> 01:38:07.977
<i>A limitlessly kind,
sweet, giving,</i>

01:38:08.057 --> 01:38:09.661
<i>and genuine person.</i>

01:38:09.817 --> 01:38:11.979
<i>No matter how much
he would deny it.</i>

01:38:12.657 --> 01:38:14.944
<i>The drop in his academic
performance this year...</i>

01:38:15.017 --> 01:38:16.143
<i>...is the consequence
of all the time</i>

01:38:16.217 --> 01:38:17.264
<i>he spent with me...</i>

01:38:17.377 --> 01:38:19.778
<i>...and the time he spent
making things for me...</i>

01:38:19.857 --> 01:38:22.098
<i>...and how hard
that was for him.</i>

01:38:22.217 --> 01:38:23.901
<i>You can ask him about it...</i>

01:38:23.977 --> 01:38:26.139
<i>...but his sort of
over-the-top humility</i>

01:38:26.217 --> 01:38:27.981
<i>will probably get in the way.</i>

01:38:28.897 --> 01:38:32.026
<i>No one has done more
to make me smile than he has.</i>

01:38:32.177 --> 01:38:33.861
<i>And no one ever could.</i>

01:38:51.617 --> 01:38:52.977
<i>Rachel's ashes were scattered</i>

01:38:53.057 --> 01:38:55.105
<i>in a park behind her house.</i>

01:38:55.737 --> 01:38:57.501
<i>Apparently, she ran away
from home once</i>

01:38:57.577 --> 01:38:59.386
<i>and tried to live there.</i>

01:39:00.617 --> 01:39:03.541
<i>It was this story
her aunt told at the funeral.</i>

01:39:03.697 --> 01:39:06.064
<i>She was trying
to become a squirrel.</i>

01:39:06.737 --> 01:39:08.097
<i>She thought she could
turn into one</i>

01:39:08.137 --> 01:39:09.423
<i>just by being in the forest...</i>

01:39:09.577 --> 01:39:11.739
<i>...and wanting it really bad.</i>

01:39:12.457 --> 01:39:15.540
<i>I guess maybe that's
what Mr. McCarthy meant...</i>

01:39:15.697 --> 01:39:18.701
<i>...about someone's life
continuing to unfold.</i>

01:39:19.737 --> 01:39:21.341
<i>It was weird to be
learning something new</i>

01:39:21.417 --> 01:39:23.419
<i>about Rachel after she died.</i>

01:39:24.377 --> 01:39:27.267
<i>But somehow,
it was reassuring as well.</i>
