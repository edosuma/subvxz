[police siren wails]

00:28.820 --> 00:30.822
[trolley grinds]

00:35.202 --> 00:38.539
-Welcome back Mrs. A.
-Thank you Donovan.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.583
What a beautiful morning.

00:41.667 --> 00:44.878
My mother always said ''Every day
above ground is a good day.''

00:45.045 --> 00:47.047
Sounds like a very special lady.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.924
She was a saint,
you would have loved her.

00:49.007 --> 00:52.010
-You need some help with those?
-No thanks, I can manage.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.557
[elevator door closes]

01:02.813 --> 01:04.815
[beeps to signal the floors]

01:07.359 --> 01:11.697
[elevator grinds and stucks]

01:12.155 --> 01:13.198
Oh, no.

01:13.824 --> 01:14.825
Oh, no.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.377
Hello?

01:26.587 --> 01:27.462
Hello?

01:28.046 --> 01:30.632
Hello? Hello?

01:42.769 --> 01:43.604
Hello?

01:50.068 --> 01:51.278
Hello!

01:54.948 --> 01:56.074
Hello!

01:56.617 --> 01:57.659
Anybody?

01:58.368 --> 01:59.286
Help.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.163
Anybody!

02:04.458 --> 02:05.500
Somebody?

02:06.293 --> 02:07.544
Hello?

02:09.212 --> 02:10.672
Hello!  Anybody?

02:12.466 --> 02:13.550
[meows]

02:19.848 --> 02:21.516
Hello!  Anybody?

02:21.683 --> 02:23.685
[elevator grinding]

02:27.564 --> 02:29.566
-Help!
-[cable breaks]

02:32.819 --> 02:34.821
[elevator crashes]

02:37.991 --> 02:39.201
[people chattering]

02:39.326 --> 02:41.078
Hey, we got your message.
What's up?

02:42.204 --> 02:44.414
[TJ sighs]
I need a fresh set of eyes on this one.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.083
Her name is Kristen Aykroyd.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.627
She was dead at the scene,
yesterday at the Drake Apartments.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.921
Dr. Kornbluth just published
the preliminary.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.299
Age 73, weight 110 pounds.

02:54.383 --> 02:55.842
Height, 5 foot, 4 inches.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.637
-Five foot four?
-Here's the rest of her.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.848
She was bisected, cut in half.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.183
[Burl] Christ-on-a-bike.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.852
She was on faulty elevator,
tried to climb out.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.313
Det. Links said the circuit box
might've been tampered with,

03:08.397 --> 03:09.690
which would make it premeditated.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.817
Looks like she had decided to downsize.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.152
-[Cora laughs]
-Excuse me?

03:15.070 --> 03:16.530
-Nothing.
-No, no...

03:16.613 --> 03:18.073
-You said something.
-No.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.451
He says she decided to downsize.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.328
I get it, cop humor.

03:23.412 --> 03:25.831
[smirks] Very funny.
[takes a deep breath]

03:25.956 --> 03:28.375
The victim is bisected
between her pubis and pelvic bones.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.585
That's her secret,
she looks half her age.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.963
[laughs] I always wanted a half-sister.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.631
Are you both done?

03:36.049 --> 03:36.883
Yes.

03:37.426 --> 03:38.969
The victim lived alone, was unmarried--

03:39.052 --> 03:40.971
-I heard she was separated.
-[Burl laughs]

03:41.054 --> 03:41.888
Burl...

03:43.724 --> 03:46.727
[sighs] I guess it's true.
You really do shrink as you get older.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.770
-[laughs]
-[TJ] Excuse me, detectives...

03:48.895 --> 03:50.522
This woman was a real person, okay?

03:50.605 --> 03:52.649
She was young once.
Probably quite beautiful.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.819
-Yeah, she was a ten, now she's a five.
-[Burl and Cora laugh]

03:57.738 --> 03:59.406
[Cora sniffles] Oh!

03:59.698 --> 04:03.076
-No.
-She was a ten, now she's a five.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.786
-That's not funny.
-Why are you laughing?

04:04.870 --> 04:06.371
-I'm not laughing.
-Yeah?

04:06.455 --> 04:08.582
I'm laughing now
because you're in my face, so...

04:08.665 --> 04:10.876
[Cora laughs] I got it.

04:11.209 --> 04:14.171
I...
I was going to talk to you about that.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.090
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

04:17.174 --> 04:18.884
-[elevator dings]
-Cora.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.094
-Can I have that back?
-No.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.513
That's a performance review,
that's a confidential document.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.056
Go to hell, Caruso.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.517
Always shows initiative, seven?

04:27.601 --> 04:29.770
-That's above average.
-What did you give Burl?

04:29.853 --> 04:32.022
-It doesn't matter--
-What'd you get for initiative?

04:32.105 --> 04:32.939
[Burl] A seven.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.733
He got a seven?

04:34.941 --> 04:36.234
He doesn't run.

04:36.318 --> 04:37.986
It's true, I don't run.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.531
Caruso, if you send this upstream,
I'll never get promoted.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.743
Respect for authority, a four?

04:44.826 --> 04:46.995
You just told me to go to hell,
10 seconds ago.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.872
Interpersonal skills, a six!

04:48.955 --> 04:50.415
Well, you're flippant.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.459
-I'm flippant?
-With people...

04:52.709 --> 04:53.543
and me.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.295
Especially me.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.547
Cora, I know I'm tough on you, okay?

04:57.631 --> 05:01.051
But it's because I expect a lot out of you
and it's because I respect you that,

05:01.134 --> 05:03.929
-honestly I can tell you--
-How lucky you are to be so perfect.

05:04.012 --> 05:08.016
-I'm not perfect. I never said that.
-So squeaky clean, so clean you squeak.

05:08.099 --> 05:12.229
If only the whole world could be,
as squeaky clean as TJ Caruso.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.231
Here's the difference between us.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.733
Eventually, I'm gonna get my promotion,

05:16.942 --> 05:21.488
and you, you're always going to be...
sad and... squeaky.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.073
-[laughs]
-[Captain clears throat]

05:23.198 --> 05:24.032
Captain.

05:24.115 --> 05:27.035
Caruso, Detective Vasquez.
I'm glad you're both here.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.870
Put everything else on hold.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.998
You're moving
into the Drake Apartment on 73rd...

05:32.290 --> 05:34.000
undercover, together.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.002
You'll be posing as husband and wife.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.797
Um... [laughs]

05:38.880 --> 05:39.923
Excuse me?

05:42.133 --> 05:43.718
There's been three accidents,

05:43.802 --> 05:44.928
all suspicious,

05:45.011 --> 05:46.638
all in the last five weeks.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.140
Maybe the owner is killing
all the rent-controlled tenants.

05:49.307 --> 05:52.561
That was our original theory,
but the apartments been co-op for years.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.312
Maybe it's a mystery.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.481
[policemen chattering]

05:56.690 --> 05:57.691
Moving on.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.235
We're looking for a psychopath;

06:00.318 --> 06:01.319
a serial killer.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.114
Most likely, it's somebody
who lives or works in the building.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.533
And we're supposed to be married?

06:06.616 --> 06:07.534
That's the idea.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.286
Here's our best lead.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.455
The killer dropped a handwritten note
in the basement.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.208
Instructions on
how to override the elevator panel.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.752
There was no DNA on it, no usable prints,

06:17.836 --> 06:19.504
only the handwriting itself.

06:20.171 --> 06:23.091
Forty-four words, 223 characters.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.093
And... we're living together?

06:25.176 --> 06:26.678
Yes, for the third time.

06:26.928 --> 06:27.846
You're married.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.348
You're going to be living
in one of the victims'apartments

06:30.473 --> 06:31.850
posing as her nephew.

06:32.142 --> 06:35.270
You need to get handwriting samples
of every resident

06:35.437 --> 06:38.273
and employee in the building,
and send them back to us.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.817
Iggy Pop can compare them
to the killers note.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.193
Iggy Pop?

06:42.569 --> 06:44.404
Captain, I don't think we can...

06:44.738 --> 06:47.532
work together like that anymore.

06:47.616 --> 06:50.368
Why not?  You have the
best track record in the department.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.746
We might have philosophic differences.

06:52.829 --> 06:57.125
-Yes, our styles might not mesh.
-Honestly, I'm afraid I might kill him.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.960
If we have to live together,
I would let her.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.629
[Cora] It'd be like living with the Pope.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.340
-He's so puritanical.
-They're called rules and regulations.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.342
They're not suggestions,
and they're not optional.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.344
Lighten up, Caruso.
What are you so afraid of?

07:07.427 --> 07:09.012
I'm afraid of you, and people like you.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.722
-Anarchists.
-You're a freak of nature.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.266
-You're a child.
-No one's gonna believe we're married.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.477
No one's gonna believe
you're not married.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.396
Captain, if we...

07:24.486 --> 07:25.320
Married.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.158
[people chattering]

07:30.659 --> 07:31.618
Can you find him?

07:32.911 --> 07:34.371
Moshe can find anybody.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.206
You should see him on Pesach.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.999
We hide the <i>afikoman...</i>  boom,

07:38.083 --> 07:39.793
Moshe's there, every year.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.295
Joseph Privett?

07:42.712 --> 07:45.423
-With a "P"?
-Yes, with a "P".

07:45.799 --> 07:47.759
He left New York city three weeks ago,

07:48.009 --> 07:50.178
took a bus to Chicago. That's all I know.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.262
And who's that?

07:51.429 --> 07:53.598
This is his common-law wife, Phyllis.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.141
He hasn't called her.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.477
Does he know you're looking for him?

07:57.644 --> 07:58.728
Yes, he does.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.774
-Does he know why you looking for him?
-Yes, he does.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.443
Well, care to enlighten us? It might help.

08:06.778 --> 08:07.696
It's about Connie.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.740
He killed my wife.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.409
Why come to us?

08:12.951 --> 08:14.202
Why not go to the police?

08:15.996 --> 08:17.580
Because he killed my wife.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.713
It's my bag, I can carry it, sweetheart.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.298
Quite alright, honey. I got it.

08:27.382 --> 08:30.051
[doorman] Mr. Akroyd. [chuckles]

08:30.385 --> 08:33.013
-And you must be Cora.
-Yes, hi.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.432
-Hello.
-I'm Donovan, welcome to the Drake.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.349
Thank you.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.977
-How long will you be with us?
-Not long.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.938
-Just getting my aunt's affairs in order.
-Yes, of course.

08:42.022 --> 08:45.775
May I just say,
I am so sorry for your loss.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.193
Mrs. A was...

08:47.861 --> 08:48.945
a special person.

08:49.654 --> 08:52.824
I've only been here a few months,
I didn't know her well, but I could tell,

08:53.116 --> 08:54.117
she was an angel.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.661
Yes, she was an angel.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.706
I grew up around here,
so if you have any questions...

08:59.789 --> 09:01.708
I was wondering,
is there a good gym nearby?

09:01.791 --> 09:04.794
-It's not for me, It's for Squeaky.
-Squeaky?

09:05.587 --> 09:08.214
That's my husband's nickname,
everybody calls him that.

09:08.673 --> 09:12.302
No, I... You know, honey, I don't think,
I don't think that they do.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.596
You know, I have a hamster named Squeaky.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.014
[laughs] So do I.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.684
When we were dating,
Squeaky was very jacked.

09:19.768 --> 09:23.271
Can you believe it? Now look at him.
Couldn't bench-press a box of Kleenex.

09:23.354 --> 09:26.191
Well, there's Smigel's Gym
on 71st and Broadway.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.068
Could you write that down for me?

09:29.027 --> 09:31.029
Because he'll forget.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.864
Early onset dementia.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.784
-I have some paper back here.
-Thank you.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.497
-What are you doing?
-What?

09:40.705 --> 09:43.374
-We're supposed to be married.
-Married people fight.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.418
Okay, but why are we fighting?

09:45.752 --> 09:47.128
We're undercover, we need--

09:47.670 --> 09:48.755
We need a back-story.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.715
How about this.

09:51.216 --> 09:54.677
We were happily married for about a year,
but last week I overheard you talking,

09:54.761 --> 09:56.805
and learned
you don't really respect me at all.

09:56.888 --> 09:59.099
You thought
I was irresponsible and flippant,

09:59.182 --> 10:01.601
and you gave me very low scores.
And that's why we're fighting.

10:01.684 --> 10:04.312
That's why there's no way in hell
we will ever sleep together.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.814
Ever, ever.

10:05.897 --> 10:06.731
Ever.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.360
Yeah, yeah, that works.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.277
Okay.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.154
Okay, Smigel's Gym.

10:13.404 --> 10:14.405
Ask for Michelle.

10:14.697 --> 10:18.076
Perfect, thank you, you know what?
Let me just take a photo of that.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.620
Good idea, in case Squeaky loses it.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.747
[Cora chuckles]

10:23.331 --> 10:25.333
[policemen chattering]

10:28.628 --> 10:30.630
[phone ringing]

10:45.770 --> 10:47.438
[doorman] Sorry about the stairs.

10:47.522 --> 10:50.984
Everyone's afraid to use the elevator
after what happened.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.153
[Cora sighs] I don't blame them.

10:55.530 --> 10:58.199
[doorman huffs]
So this is exactly how she left it.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.285
Bless her heart.

11:00.702 --> 11:03.371
There's some cartons downstairs
If you want to start packing up.

11:03.538 --> 11:05.456
The laundry's in the basement.

11:05.540 --> 11:08.710
They don't take quarters anymore,
they use the electronic cards.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.588
-[mobile phone buzzes]
-I love this apartment.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.798
It's quiet because it's in the back.

11:14.591 --> 11:17.135
[doorman]
All the courtyard apartments are quiet.

11:22.724 --> 11:23.641
Aunt Kristen...

11:24.601 --> 11:25.935
sure loved her photos.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.021
No pictures of you?

11:28.479 --> 11:29.564
Oh no, there are.

11:30.982 --> 11:31.816
That's me.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.194
You were blonde?

11:34.777 --> 11:36.905
Yeah, I was blonde.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.407
And a girl?

11:42.577 --> 11:45.413
-That might not be me.
-[doorman laughs]

11:45.496 --> 11:47.707
You're not going to find
any pictures of Squeaky.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.043
Aunt Kristen didn't really like him.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.086
She thought he was too judgmental.

11:53.755 --> 11:54.923
Love the courtyard.

11:56.007 --> 11:58.968
-What's that plaque?
-[doorman] The courtyard is famous.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.678
Or infamous.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.014
Twenty years ago,
a woman named Betty Weir

12:03.097 --> 12:04.390
was assaulted there.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.600
She was stabbed.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.769
I remember that case. It was a big story.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.813
Some neighbors heard her screaming
for help, but no one called the police.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.524
What are you going to do?
It's the society we're living in.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.486
Somebody getting married?

12:16.569 --> 12:19.656
Nope, that's a memorial service
for your aunt.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.991
Heads up, they'll probably ask you
to say a few words.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.618
He would love to.

12:26.204 --> 12:27.622
Yes, of course.

12:28.623 --> 12:29.457
Love to.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.627
[Tony Sr.] He's here?
He's in New York City?

12:32.710 --> 12:35.630
[lady] You were right,
he was in Chicago for two weeks,

12:35.713 --> 12:36.965
then Kansas City.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.633
He kept changing his name.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.886
He was smart,
but my Moshe was smarter.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.764
[Tony Sr.] And now he's back in New York.
Is he with the wife?

12:44.889 --> 12:46.891
[lady] No, he hasn't even called her.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.894
Moshe seems to think
he came back to get something.

12:50.311 --> 12:53.398
Something he left behind,
something he forgot?

12:53.731 --> 12:56.025
-What? What is it?
-[lady] Moshe doesn't know.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.612
Did we get an address? It's a big city.

12:59.696 --> 13:03.700
[lady] No, we don't know where he is,
but I know where he will be.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.453
Doctor Kim's?

13:07.870 --> 13:10.456
[lady]
It's an acupuncture clinic in Chinatown.

13:11.249 --> 13:15.086
Mr. Privett, when he's in town, goes there
every week for this twitchy eye.

13:16.170 --> 13:19.215
He has an appointment
this afternoon at five o'clock.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.510
We made you an appointment, 4:30.

13:24.679 --> 13:27.390
This is where you say,
"Thank you, Mrs. Spiro."

13:28.683 --> 13:30.018
Thank you, Mrs. Spiro.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.020
And this is when you pay me.

13:32.812 --> 13:33.646
Yeah, sorry.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.233
I'm a little light.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.152
But I'm good for it.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.071
I'm calling it square.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.489
For Connie.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.199
I liked her.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.243
She came to Moshe's bar mitzvah.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.620
I remember the two of you danced

13:49.704 --> 13:51.873
to Madonna, Frank Sinatra.

13:52.874 --> 13:53.958
You danced all night,

13:54.042 --> 13:55.251
do you remember that?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.337
-[music playing]
-[people chattering]

13:59.339 --> 14:01.090
Do I remember dancing with Connie?

14:05.011 --> 14:06.262
I don't have to remember.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.224
I think about it all the time.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.562
Thank you, Mrs. Spiro.

14:14.645 --> 14:15.855
Thank you, Moshe.

14:20.902 --> 14:21.736
Aunt Kristen.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.491
I, honestly, don't know where to begin.

14:28.451 --> 14:29.994
She loved spices...

14:31.954 --> 14:33.414
and John Grisham novels.

14:37.585 --> 14:38.503
And <i>US Weekly.</i>

14:41.422 --> 14:42.423
Fig Newtons...

14:43.633 --> 14:45.468
and heating pads. [chuckles]

14:46.386 --> 14:48.554
Don't get me started
on those heating pads.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.306
[attendants] Yeah.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.184
She kept plastic bags.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.479
Hundreds of them,
kept them under the kitchen sink.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.273
What was that all about?

15:02.735 --> 15:03.778
John Grisham novels.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.074
I mention that,
I mentioned that already.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.369
It's true, she was a hoarder.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.414
But...

15:16.999 --> 15:17.875
she never...

15:19.001 --> 15:20.378
hoarded her love...

15:23.005 --> 15:23.840
for us.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.385
-[woman] It's true.
-[people murmur]

15:44.110 --> 15:46.279
-What's this?
-It's a memory book.

15:46.487 --> 15:49.782
I'm asking all the guests to write
a few lines about your Aunt Kristen.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.201
Handwriting samples, that's a good idea.

15:52.702 --> 15:55.204
Yeah, some might call it
showing initiative.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.416
Not you, of course.
I'm talking about other people.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.376
Fair-minded people, mature people.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.462
Excuse me.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.130
I didn't get to sign.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.256
Of course.

16:07.258 --> 16:08.801
-There you go.
-Thank you.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.094
I don't think we've met.

16:10.678 --> 16:11.929
Olivia Nyborg.

16:12.263 --> 16:14.140
I live in 5G, right up there.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.809
I can't believe I'm wearing black again.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.103
This is our third memorial this year.

16:19.187 --> 16:20.021
Yes, we heard.

16:21.147 --> 16:21.981
Any theories?

16:22.648 --> 16:25.860
Well, either this building is cursed
or we're very very unlucky.

16:26.068 --> 16:29.113
What else could it be?
You know, I knew your aunt.

16:29.197 --> 16:33.493
She was good people. Just look around.
Almost everybody in the building is here.

16:34.285 --> 16:35.244
That says a lot.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.748
-Almost everybody?
-Everybody except for Nathan Cobb,

16:38.956 --> 16:41.292
in 7A. He's a strange bird.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.419
Nobody really knows him, or wants to.

16:43.669 --> 16:44.629
Nathan Cobb.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.298
I knew Kristin had a nephew,
but I didn't know you were married.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.301
Well, [chuckles] It happened very quickly.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.720
We were introduced by a friend, last year,

16:52.803 --> 16:54.514
and, well, that was it.

16:54.597 --> 16:57.099
-That was it, alright.
-Cora's unlike any woman I've ever met.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.560
Yeah, I'd go out with him.
He was a virgin.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.022
And Cora was the opposite of a virgin.

17:03.481 --> 17:06.150
Frankly, I'm surprised
she's kept her amateur status.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.237
I know what you're thinking,
I could have done a lot better.

17:09.320 --> 17:12.281
-No, I wasn't thinking that.
-Well someone was thinking it.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.699
Oh wait, it was me.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.243
May I say something?

17:15.326 --> 17:16.160
Please.

17:16.244 --> 17:18.287
I was a marriage counselor for 35 years.

17:18.496 --> 17:21.666
You know how a baseball player
can read a curve ball in an instant,

17:21.749 --> 17:22.625
just like that?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.794
That's me with marriages,

17:24.877 --> 17:27.171
and I've been watching you two
all afternoon.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.130
Watching us?

17:28.214 --> 17:29.674
And I like what I see.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.218
The bantering, the teasing...

17:32.552 --> 17:35.972
It's a dance you do.
It's obviously a deep form of affection.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.473
-Well...
-It's very sexual.

17:37.598 --> 17:38.432
No. [TJ laughs]

17:38.933 --> 17:40.643
I don't know.

17:40.726 --> 17:41.852
-Probably not.
-No.

17:41.978 --> 17:45.022
I'm never wrong about these things,
and you two are going to go the distance.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.276
Have I crossed the line? I don't care.

17:48.359 --> 17:51.654
That's one of the perks of getting older,
you can say whatever you want.

17:51.737 --> 17:52.947
[chuckles] Bye, kids.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.699
-See you around campus.
-Okay.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.496
Well, we've fooled her.

18:01.539 --> 18:04.417
-We sure did, good job.
-You too, you too.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.254
I'm going to get these samples
back to Ryan now.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.171
Good idea.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.093
[city noises]

18:17.346 --> 18:19.348
[music playing]

18:40.536 --> 18:42.204
Mr. Caruso, hello.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.373
-Thank you.
-Hey, how you doing.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.376
I'm Dr. Kim, this is my assistant Vera.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.837
Nice to meet you. Excuse me...

18:49.962 --> 18:51.547
-could we leave that open?
-Why?

18:51.756 --> 18:52.923
You want to run away?

18:53.007 --> 18:55.343
No, no, that's funny though. [chuckles]

18:55.426 --> 18:58.095
No, I'm just a little claustrophobic.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.056
Claustrophobic, yes.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.432
We see that a lot.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.559
We can help you, just lie down.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.645
No, no, I'm good. I'm good.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.605
Why can't we just talk for a minute?

19:07.688 --> 19:10.024
We are not here to talk, Mr. Caruso.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.734
We're here to cure you.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.654
-Now lie down.
-[both ladies] Down, down.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.325
[Tony Sr.] Down, down.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.453
Don't worry, you're in good hands.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.496
I'm a doctor.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.249
I don't see a diploma.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.419
I'm an adjunct, an adjunct doctor.

19:32.630 --> 19:33.673
Okay, great.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.926
You seem very anxious.

19:37.093 --> 19:39.679
Well, I'm meeting somebody later.

19:39.970 --> 19:43.849
-Oh, is it an important meeting?
-Yes, very important.

19:44.141 --> 19:47.144
Anxiety is very serious, Mr. Caruso.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.230
It unbalances your body.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.232
You have to stay balanced.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.149
Yeah.

19:53.484 --> 19:54.985
-What's she doing?
-Alcohol.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.488
-For the needles.
-You know, forget the needles.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.323
You'd have better luck
with just the alcohol.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.742
[chuckles] Here we go.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.995
No, no, no. The face?

20:05.496 --> 20:07.206
We always start with the face.

20:07.707 --> 20:08.582
Right there.

20:08.791 --> 20:11.877
-It's called the third eye.
-I don't need a third eye.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.379
Thank you, though.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.715
You know I'm good
with one on each side.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.383
Family tradition, you know?

20:17.508 --> 20:20.177
And I just, I just bought
new reading glasses as well.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.225
[water flowing]

20:26.684 --> 20:27.685
Can you feel that?

20:29.687 --> 20:30.521
Yeah, it's...

20:32.857 --> 20:34.024
It's pretty good.

20:35.693 --> 20:38.654
It's your body releasing endorphins.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.448
That's...

20:42.032 --> 20:43.993
That's pretty good, yeah.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.746
How long has this been going on?

20:47.204 --> 20:48.456
Five thousand years.

20:57.715 --> 20:58.549
Hello.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.565
[doctor] We need more needles.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.984
More needles. [chuckles]

21:17.526 --> 21:18.819
That's a good idea.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.447
Hey, are you married?

21:24.200 --> 21:25.034
Yeah.

21:26.076 --> 21:27.912
-You want to sleep?
-No, no.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.915
-No, I gotta meet a guy.
-[man] Excuse me.

21:32.249 --> 21:34.502
How much longer? You said 5 o'clock.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.337
It won't be much longer.

21:38.422 --> 21:39.256
Where's my coat?

21:39.381 --> 21:41.008
In the back, we hung it up.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.117
Privett!

22:08.077 --> 22:10.079
-[Tony Sr. grunts]
-[Privett gasps]

22:10.454 --> 22:12.456
[both grunt]

22:14.542 --> 22:16.377
Come here! [grunts]

22:17.711 --> 22:19.713
[Privett pants]

22:24.218 --> 22:25.427
[shouts] Connie! [sobs]

22:29.765 --> 22:31.767
[starts crying]

22:42.653 --> 22:44.655
[policemen chattering]

22:56.208 --> 22:57.918
[mobile phone buzzes]

22:59.920 --> 23:01.005
That was Ryan.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.383
-He's checked all 84 handwriting samples.
-And?

23:05.676 --> 23:07.177
[huffs] So that's everyone cleared,

23:07.261 --> 23:09.263
all the tenants,
everyone who works on staff.

23:09.430 --> 23:11.599
Everyone except the elusive Nathan Cobb.

23:20.065 --> 23:20.983
Hey, Cora.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.151
Squeaky.

23:22.860 --> 23:23.694
Hello.

23:24.445 --> 23:26.322
We're looking for Nathan Cobb.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.324
We already met
everyone else from the building.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.368
-We just wanted to say hi.
-That's mighty neighborly of you.

23:31.785 --> 23:33.996
Nathan's out of town.
I'm feeding his family.

23:34.538 --> 23:35.539
[Cora] His family?

23:35.789 --> 23:37.499
Yeah, that's what he calls them,
his family.

23:37.583 --> 23:40.461
He has like 100 different reptiles.
When he's out of town,

23:40.544 --> 23:41.712
I come in once a day,

23:41.795 --> 23:43.172
feed them, clean the cages.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.757
That's Bruno Tattaglia,

23:45.132 --> 23:47.259
they all have names from <i>The Godfather.</i>

23:47.343 --> 23:48.969
Okay, that's Clemenza.

23:49.386 --> 23:50.638
Luca Brasi,

23:50.763 --> 23:52.765
This little guy is Fredo. [laughs]

23:52.848 --> 23:55.684
[sniffs] What a character, only Nathan
would give them names like that.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.728
[Tony Sr.]
Yeah, we're sorry we missed him.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.104
Where is he?

23:59.396 --> 24:01.690
He sells high school textbooks,
so he travels a lot.

24:01.774 --> 24:02.983
[Cora] How long he's been gone?

24:03.484 --> 24:07.404
Let's see, he left
just after your aunt died.

24:07.488 --> 24:10.449
Maybe even the day of.
Any way, hasn't been back since.

24:13.077 --> 24:15.454
Squeaky, careful. It's a krait snake.

24:15.955 --> 24:16.789
A krait?

24:17.039 --> 24:18.582
Little fella doesn't look like much,

24:18.666 --> 24:20.542
but that's the most poisonous snake
in the world.

24:20.626 --> 24:21.543
Okay.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.171
That's Vito Corleone,
the Godfather himself.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.549
One bite from him,
you wouldn't last two minutes.

24:28.592 --> 24:29.677
What's this?

24:30.260 --> 24:32.304
Instructions from Nathan, who gets what.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.390
Nathan Cobb wrote all this out.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.101
Yes, ma'am.  He is very particular,

24:37.518 --> 24:39.144
they all have different diets, so...

24:42.106 --> 24:43.899
Who's this little guy?

24:44.066 --> 24:47.403
[TJ] That? That looks like a crocodile.
They're illegal in the state of New York.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.154
You should be careful. That's a...

24:50.572 --> 24:51.448
an infraction.

24:51.532 --> 24:54.118
You know what?
Why don't you let him know?

24:54.201 --> 24:56.078
Why don't you tell him he's an infraction.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.247
That's not... Darling, put it back.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.125
-Why don't you tell him?
-Not funny. Darling!

25:02.543 --> 25:03.627
Put it back in the tank.

25:05.129 --> 25:06.630
-Thank you.
-Sorry.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.842
My husband suffers
from reptile dysfunction.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.844
[TJ laughs] That's not true.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.596
My wife is cold-blooded,
but we get along great.

25:14.722 --> 25:17.057
Dr. Nyborg was right, I can see that.

25:17.391 --> 25:18.350
About what?

25:18.434 --> 25:20.102
She said you two
were made for each other.

25:20.269 --> 25:22.312
You remind me of my parents, actually.

25:23.147 --> 25:24.732
They were the happiest couple
I ever knew.

25:30.571 --> 25:34.158
[Ryan] <i>I don't know what happened.</i>
<i>The hard drive just crashed.</i>

25:34.283 --> 25:36.452
What do you mean the hard drive crashed?

25:37.911 --> 25:40.748
Ryan, that computer's police property,
you're playing video games again?

25:41.498 --> 25:42.332
No.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.543
-[video game beeps]
-Shh!

25:46.295 --> 25:49.214
-[TJ] Is the handwriting a match?
-The computer's down.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.050
We won't know till tomorrow.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.886
I mean, It's gotta be him, right?
We eliminated everybody else.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.304
We'll know soon enough.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.848
-[TJ gαrgles]
-Good work, detective.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.059
We couldn't have solved that case
without you.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.687
Sorry, did you say something?

26:05.689 --> 26:07.399
Nope, was just talking to myself.

26:08.442 --> 26:09.860
That's a sign of insanity.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.195
I'm sure it is.

26:12.946 --> 26:13.822
Are you bleeding?

26:14.406 --> 26:15.240
Am I?

26:15.407 --> 26:16.950
-Is that a new top?
-Yes.

26:18.535 --> 26:19.912
You're supposed to remove the pins.

26:22.372 --> 26:23.332
That explains it.

26:24.750 --> 26:25.584
Thank you.

26:27.461 --> 26:28.629
Where are your pajamas?

26:28.796 --> 26:31.465
I left them at Abby Crenshaw's house
when I was 8 years old.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.134
-Oh.
-She lives in Queens, should I call her?

26:34.218 --> 26:36.220
No, she's probably sleeping.
Better not wake her.

26:39.056 --> 26:40.015
Well...

26:40.682 --> 26:43.310
it's pretty late, so... [huffs]

26:45.771 --> 26:46.605
Good night.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.169
I... I thought this folded out.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.800
[laughs]

27:17.219 --> 27:18.637
<i>Cyrano De Bergarac.</i>

27:19.054 --> 27:21.932
We watched that in high school.
I love that movie.

27:22.099 --> 27:24.101
[TJ squeaks]

27:26.979 --> 27:28.438
Is that why they call you "Squeaky"?

27:28.772 --> 27:31.233
They don't call me "Squeaky,"
you call me "Squeaky."

27:32.109 --> 27:33.652
What do you think, head to toe?

27:34.236 --> 27:35.154
Sure.

27:36.488 --> 27:37.322
So...

27:38.115 --> 27:39.449
head, toe, head, toe?

27:39.825 --> 27:40.701
Sounds good.

27:40.909 --> 27:41.743
Or...

27:42.536 --> 27:43.370
toe, head?

27:43.620 --> 27:44.454
Toe, head.

27:44.538 --> 27:46.540
-Either way, I'm good.
-Or...

27:48.167 --> 27:49.126
head, toe.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.587
Head, toe, that's just normal.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.422
Okay, time's up. I'm going to bed.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.844
[Cora sighs and coughs]

28:01.930 --> 28:03.515
I've never seen your feet before.

28:04.141 --> 28:05.809
[TJ laughs]

28:08.562 --> 28:09.605
This toe.

28:10.647 --> 28:14.026
-What about it?
-It's the same length as your baby toe.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.195
-No it's not.
-It is.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.865
-Do you need special shoes?
-No, I don't need special shoes.

28:21.491 --> 28:22.326
You know what?

28:23.535 --> 28:26.038
-I need to move over there.
-Why?

28:26.121 --> 28:27.956
I need to be close to the nightstand

28:28.040 --> 28:30.083
for my sound machine.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.377
[Cora sighs]

28:34.087 --> 28:34.922
-Okay.
-Okay.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.965
-Nope, alright.  Sorry.
-Just go.

28:38.300 --> 28:39.134
Yeah.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.722
You know, I saw them
in concert last year.

28:43.931 --> 28:45.807
-Who's that?
-The Sound Machine.

28:46.099 --> 28:47.267
It was a great show.

28:47.601 --> 28:49.311
They played all their best hits.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.730
''White Noise, Babbling Brook,

28:52.272 --> 28:53.148
Heavy Rain.''

28:54.233 --> 28:56.777
Only problem was by the third song
the audience fell asleep.

28:56.860 --> 28:57.819
[Cora chuckles]

28:57.903 --> 29:00.322
-That was pretty good.
-Thanks.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.449
-[TV playing]
-[French speaking movie]

29:11.708 --> 29:12.542
Caruso?

29:12.668 --> 29:15.629
My neck is...
I don't think this is gonna work.

29:19.132 --> 29:20.008
Stay right there.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.358
[Cora laughs]

29:38.944 --> 29:40.654
-How's that?
-That's pretty good.

29:44.074 --> 29:44.908
Thanks.

29:45.909 --> 29:46.743
Except...

29:47.744 --> 29:48.578
Except?

29:48.912 --> 29:50.664
It has subtitles, I can't read it.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.715
[TJ reads subtitles for Cora]
"My allowances is from my father.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.383
It is gone in one day."

30:03.093 --> 30:04.761
"You tossed over the entire bag."

30:05.137 --> 30:06.054
"What a joke."

30:07.097 --> 30:07.931
"Cyrano,

30:08.015 --> 30:10.767
What is the reason
you hate Montefiore?"

30:12.102 --> 30:13.478
"The truth, tell me!"

30:14.730 --> 30:17.482
"The satyr is so fat,
his finger cannot reach his navel."

30:17.566 --> 30:18.692
-[chuckles]
-"Still,

30:19.735 --> 30:21.987
He believes
he is a sweet danger to women."

30:28.076 --> 30:30.370
"Farewell Roxanne, because...

30:31.330 --> 30:32.706
today I die."

30:34.249 --> 30:37.878
"No more shall my eyes drink
the sight of you like wine."

30:39.296 --> 30:40.922
"Nevermore with a look

30:41.423 --> 30:43.216
that is more a kiss than a look...

30:44.301 --> 30:47.054
shall I follow sweet grace of you?"

30:48.513 --> 30:49.389
"I am...

30:50.932 --> 30:52.225
and will be...

30:52.517 --> 30:53.643
in the next world...

30:55.020 --> 30:57.147
the one who loved you with all his soul."

32:28.697 --> 32:29.531
Cora!

32:31.658 --> 32:32.492
Cora!

32:34.661 --> 32:36.079
There's a snake in my pants.

32:36.746 --> 32:39.416
[sighs] Go to sleep, Caruso.

32:39.749 --> 32:40.584
I can feel it.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.420
I can feel it moving.

32:44.504 --> 32:45.464
Men.

32:46.882 --> 32:47.799
I think it's Vito.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.343
I think it's Vito Corleone,
the Godfather.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.640
It's the krait. [pants]

32:56.475 --> 32:58.268
Caruso, we just solved the case.

32:58.685 --> 33:00.437
It's Nathan Cobb. Who else could it be?

33:00.520 --> 33:03.273
That his snake, we've already
eliminated everybody else.

33:03.398 --> 33:04.608
I'm calling the Captain.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.736
Wait, wait, no, don't call yet.

33:09.738 --> 33:10.614
Snake.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.032
Oh, right, okay.

33:16.244 --> 33:17.245
What are you doing?

33:17.621 --> 33:18.580
Don't move.

33:18.663 --> 33:21.208
-I got a head shot, I can do this.
-No, no, bad idea.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.543
Bad, bad, bad, bad idea.

33:25.086 --> 33:27.464
Okay, fine, we'll call that plan B.
Just relax.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.549
I'm more afraid of you right now
than the snake.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.136
-Stay where you are.
-Where you going?

33:35.931 --> 33:36.765
Cora!

33:43.647 --> 33:44.481
Where'd it go?

34:02.624 --> 34:04.125
Where'd you get these pajamas?

34:04.417 --> 34:05.293
Macy's.

34:06.419 --> 34:08.838
-They're good. They comfortable?
-I like them.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.258
-So does Vito, my pet snake.
-Okay, sorry!

34:12.092 --> 34:14.261
Oh my God!

34:15.845 --> 34:16.680
Okay.

34:20.976 --> 34:21.810
Ready?

34:22.394 --> 34:24.104
-On ten.
-Wait, wait, wait.

34:24.354 --> 34:26.022
Not ten, on three, do three.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.692
Okay, one...

34:30.610 --> 34:31.820
Two!

34:31.903 --> 34:34.531
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, where's the lid.

34:34.656 --> 34:37.075
Where's the lid, where is it.
I can't find it, I can't find it!

34:37.158 --> 34:39.244
-Over there!
-There it is, there it is.

34:39.327 --> 34:40.996
Put it on top! [TJ huffs]

34:41.162 --> 34:43.164
[Cora pants]

34:47.085 --> 34:49.212
-Be careful with that.
-I'm being very careful.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.798
Well, it's evidence.
That thing is a murder weapon.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.301
-Hello.
-Good morning.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.845
It's Henry, right?
I thought you work nights?

34:56.970 --> 34:58.179
Donovan called in sick,

34:58.263 --> 34:59.389
I'm just filling in.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.850
We're looking for Nathan Cobb
in apartment 7A.

35:02.058 --> 35:04.853
-We found his snake.
-Nathan's still out of town.

35:05.395 --> 35:08.148
We're pretty sure he's back,
in fact we know he's back.

35:08.231 --> 35:09.608
It's very important we talk to him.

35:09.691 --> 35:11.526
We went to his apartment,
but he didn't answer.

35:11.610 --> 35:14.904
I don't know what to say. He's not here.
He's still in San Diego, I'm positive.

35:14.988 --> 35:16.406
How are you positive?

35:16.489 --> 35:18.867
He's staying with my sister.
I talked to him last night.

35:19.409 --> 35:20.285
Where'd you find it?

35:21.369 --> 35:22.370
In my pants.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.706
Yeah, it's always the last place you look.

35:27.375 --> 35:28.835
It just doesn't make any sense.

35:28.918 --> 35:30.920
We have handwriting samples
from everybody else.

35:33.006 --> 35:34.049
What's this?

35:34.382 --> 35:37.677
It's a softball league for the staff.
We play the other buildings.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.680
-Is that Donovan?
-[Henry] He's our secret weapon.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.892
-Is he left-handed?
-[Henry] He's both!

35:43.975 --> 35:46.353
[Henry] Ambidextrous.
Pitches with either hand.

35:46.561 --> 35:47.979
He's like a freak of nature.

35:49.689 --> 35:51.691
Does he also write with either hand?

35:51.775 --> 35:53.443
Oh, yeah, I seen him do it.

35:56.279 --> 35:58.657
-If he used his left--
-His handwriting would be different.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.617
Plus, he had access to Vito Corleone.

36:02.285 --> 36:03.119
Where is he?

36:03.203 --> 36:04.120
-Donovan?
-Yeah.

36:04.204 --> 36:06.873
Like I said, he called in sick.
But if you want to leave him a note,

36:06.956 --> 36:07.957
his locker's in the back.

36:09.709 --> 36:10.543
Yeah.

36:31.606 --> 36:32.440
Cora.

36:34.776 --> 36:36.695
-Betty Weir?
-[TJ] She was killed.

36:37.070 --> 36:38.822
Right here in the courtyard,
20 years ago.

36:38.905 --> 36:40.323
Donovan DeMark was her son?

36:41.199 --> 36:42.534
Maybe he changed his name?

36:44.828 --> 36:47.539
Four Witnesses saw the attack.
None of them called the police.

36:48.456 --> 36:50.375
Donovan must have blamed them
for what happened.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.168
He got a job here as a doorman.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.547
He's been killing them off, one by one,
to avenge his mother.

36:56.089 --> 36:57.632
It's always the doorman.

36:58.425 --> 37:00.844
Why would you say that?
It's never the doorman.

37:00.969 --> 37:02.637
-It's the doorman now.
-Alright.

37:03.763 --> 37:05.306
It's occasionally the doorman.

37:06.725 --> 37:07.767
Hey, good job.

37:08.685 --> 37:09.519

Thanks, partner.

37:14.482 --> 37:15.316
Caruso!

37:16.234 --> 37:18.778

37:27.787 --> 37:28.747

37:30.039 --> 37:31.040
Over there.

37:32.292 --> 37:33.126
Over there.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.086
Here, right here.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.298
This is were she died.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.718
You heard her screaming,
you didn't do anything.

37:42.677 --> 37:45.054
-[whimpers] I was afraid.
-You were afraid?

37:46.639 --> 37:47.640
Think how she felt.

37:51.895 --> 37:53.897
[alarm wailing]

37:54.063 --> 37:56.316
[announcement] <i>Demolition will commence</i>

37:56.649 --> 37:58.651

38:26.346 --> 38:28.306

-You better hurry.

38:28.389 --> 38:29.265
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.561
You'll never get away with it.

38:37.106 --> 38:38.942
-People are watching.
<i>-</i>So what?

38:39.859 --> 38:40.944
They won't do anything.

38:41.027 --> 38:42.695
You should know that
better than anyone.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.906
Go ahead Olivia, yell for help.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.243
I've been waiting 20 years
to hear you yell for help.

38:49.619 --> 38:50.453
Donovan,

38:51.287 --> 38:52.163
put down the gun.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.790
Well hey there, Squeaky.

38:54.290 --> 38:55.959
I know you weren't her nephew.

38:56.376 --> 38:57.669
I know from the jump.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.380
I'm just sorry
that snake didn't do its job.

39:00.463 --> 39:03.216
-[Cora] It's all over, Donovan.
-Not yet, it's not.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.969
This bitch is number four,

39:06.052 --> 39:07.220
she's the last of them.

39:07.303 --> 39:08.137
No. [sobs]

39:08.221 --> 39:11.349
I got two bullets in here,
one for her, one for me.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.978
[alarm wailing]

39:33.454 --> 39:34.581
Joseph Privett.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.375
I'm Tony Caruso.

39:37.667 --> 39:38.668
I know who you are.

39:39.586 --> 39:40.962
I want to say it anyway.

39:42.547 --> 39:43.798
I'm Tony Caruso.

39:45.008 --> 39:46.843
Connie Caruso was my wife.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.053
Somebody call the police.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.138
I already did.

39:51.264 --> 39:52.849
[Cora] Hey, you hear that?

39:53.349 --> 39:56.603
The city's changed.
Your mother didn't die in vain.

39:59.063 --> 40:01.065
-You don't want me.
-Were you driving the van?

40:01.357 --> 40:02.901
The van that killed her?

40:04.110 --> 40:05.320
Was that you?

40:06.946 --> 40:08.573
I'm taking that as a yes.

40:08.865 --> 40:10.116
You don't want me.

40:10.491 --> 40:13.369
Mister, you're all I want.

40:13.995 --> 40:14.829
Donovan,

40:16.372 --> 40:17.206
can we talk?

40:18.750 --> 40:21.461
-I just want to talk.
-[shouts] I am done talking!

40:21.544 --> 40:24.130
-Okay, then just listen.
-He's putting his gun down.

40:29.218 --> 40:30.428
I'm putting my gun down.

40:35.391 --> 40:36.309
The gun is down.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.731
Donovan, my mother was killed too...

40:42.982 --> 40:43.900
in Brooklyn.

40:45.151 --> 40:46.277
It was a hit and run.

40:46.903 --> 40:48.196
Five years ago, tomorrow.

40:50.531 --> 40:51.866
I think about it everyday.

40:53.534 --> 40:54.744
I lay awake... [pants]

40:55.745 --> 40:57.622
and I think about finding the guy,

40:59.040 --> 41:00.500
and what I would do if I did.

41:02.710 --> 41:03.920
I hid this in here...

41:04.504 --> 41:05.588
five years ago.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.216
Figured it was safer than a bank.

41:09.509 --> 41:10.677
It's a lot of money.

41:12.053 --> 41:14.347
Go ahead, take it. It's yours.

41:14.764 --> 41:16.432
You think I want your money?

41:16.557 --> 41:18.017
It's over a hundred grand.

41:19.102 --> 41:20.603
It could change your life.

41:21.813 --> 41:22.730
Change my life?

41:25.066 --> 41:26.484
She begged you to stop.

41:27.485 --> 41:30.029
She begged you to stop,
that changed my life.

41:45.378 --> 41:47.463

41:47.547 --> 41:49.465
[Tony Sr. grunts]

41:49.966 --> 41:51.968
[Privett yells]

42:01.644 --> 42:02.687
My mom used to...

42:03.813 --> 42:05.815
used to make pancakes for supper.

42:06.983 --> 42:08.317
-Really?
-Yeah.

42:12.572 --> 42:14.240
[DeMark] She loved Charlie Brown.

42:17.076 --> 42:18.327
We had all of the books.

42:18.995 --> 42:20.413
My mom loved Kermit.

42:22.123 --> 42:23.791
She... could do the voice.

42:25.793 --> 42:26.627
Yeah?

42:27.086 --> 42:29.297
[DeMark]
My mom took a karate class with me.

42:31.632 --> 42:33.551
Whenever my mom would watch a movie,

42:34.135 --> 42:36.012
she would make us start at the end...

42:36.429 --> 42:38.181
to make sure everyone was okay.

42:41.768 --> 42:43.227
[DeMark] My mom used to...

42:43.811 --> 42:45.938
watch <i>Sound of... Music</i>

42:46.022 --> 42:47.607
every year on her birthday.

42:48.775 --> 42:51.360
[pants] She could find the good in anyone.

42:53.362 --> 42:54.572
I told you, don't move.

42:54.781 --> 42:56.032
[TJ] My mom...

42:56.991 --> 42:57.825
my mom...

42:58.493 --> 43:00.453
never let us buy a Halloween costume.

43:01.662 --> 43:02.830
She always used to...

43:03.289 --> 43:04.248
have us make them.

43:09.587 --> 43:11.089
[sobs] My mom sat on my bed...

43:12.423 --> 43:13.382
every night...

43:14.759 --> 43:15.927
until I fell asleep.

43:18.304 --> 43:19.889
My mom could forgive anybody.

43:21.682 --> 43:23.518
She could forgive anybody, anything.

43:26.270 --> 43:27.188
How about yours?

43:32.443 --> 43:33.820
They could forgive anybody.

43:33.903 --> 43:35.530
[DeMark cries]

43:56.342 --> 43:58.344
[Tony Sr. gasps]

43:58.594 --> 44:00.096

44:45.391 --> 44:46.434
Greg Kinnear.

44:49.812 --> 44:50.646
Good morning.

44:51.606 --> 44:52.815
Is it still raining out?

44:52.982 --> 44:54.108
[Ryan] Uh-oh!

44:54.775 --> 44:57.737
-Whats that?
-My annual performance review.

44:58.362 --> 45:00.156
You said you changed my scores.

45:00.239 --> 45:02.074
Well, I did change your score.

45:02.158 --> 45:05.203
I re-evaluated your performance,
and you went up in two categories.

45:05.912 --> 45:08.247
But I went down in five.

45:09.165 --> 45:11.918
Integrity, I went down.
Attitude, down.

45:12.001 --> 45:14.170
Respect for authority, you gave me a zero!

45:14.253 --> 45:15.922
-A zero?
-Ouch!

45:16.005 --> 45:18.674
My overall score is less,
it's less than it was.

45:19.217 --> 45:21.219
What do you expect?
You put a crocodile in my face!

45:21.302 --> 45:23.262
-A crocodile?
-Yes, a live crocodile.

45:23.346 --> 45:25.014
And she told everyone that I was a virgin.

45:25.389 --> 45:29.185
-And she calls me Squeaky.
-You do squeak.

45:30.061 --> 45:34.190
-You squeak! He actually squeaks.
-Cora, I know you're disappointed,

45:34.273 --> 45:36.234
but I have a responsibility
to the department.

45:38.861 --> 45:41.364
Detective Vasquez, you have
a dozen active cases on your desk.

45:41.447 --> 45:43.241
-Now, let's get to work.
-Yeah.

45:43.324 --> 45:46.494
Yeah, I've got a lot of work to do.
The only problem is, I don't...

45:47.203 --> 45:48.663
I don't take any initiative.

45:50.539 --> 45:51.374
Cora.

45:51.582 --> 45:53.251
I'm not going anywhere, squeaky.

45:53.542 --> 45:54.377
Cora...

45:55.336 --> 45:56.170
Cora come on.

45:59.465 --> 46:00.716
Better call 911.

46:31.539 --> 46:32.373

46:41.257 --> 46:43.259
CARUSO

46:54.687 --> 46:55.563
