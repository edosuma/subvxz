01:18.250 --> 01:19.125
Go. Go.

01:19.126 --> 01:21.542
Hurry up.

01:22.792 --> 01:23.833
Keep up.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.291
Go down. Move.

01:25.292 --> 01:26.208
Move.

01:26.209 --> 01:28.083
Keep up. Faster.

01:28.292 --> 01:29.958
Hurry up.

01:32.792 --> 01:34.041
Hurry. Move.

01:34.042 --> 01:35.167
Get on the bridge.

01:35.625 --> 01:37.208
Move. Fast.

01:37.375 --> 01:38.375
Hurry.

01:38.750 --> 01:39.792
Get down.

01:39.875 --> 01:40.917
Get down.

01:42.667 --> 01:43.958
Get down.

01:49.167 --> 01:50.167
Move.

01:50.168 --> 01:52.292
Move. Keep up.

02:03.833 --> 02:05.333
Some are dead.

02:10.167 --> 02:11.667
Mr. Stark,

02:12.583 --> 02:14.792
you're bringing me so few piglets,

02:15.208 --> 02:17.125
less than the previous times.

02:17.167 --> 02:19.667
To make up for my losses,

02:20.083 --> 02:21.332
why don't you

02:21.333 --> 02:22.875
offer them for free this time?

02:34.417 --> 02:36.667
The Chinese believe

02:36.917 --> 02:39.583
that greed

02:39.625 --> 02:41.208
is the bane of life,

02:42.250 --> 02:43.833
and an endless desire

02:44.542 --> 02:46.292
is the greatest sin.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.167
Don't bullshit me
with the Chinese cliche.

02:55.125 --> 02:57.083
So, have you heard of

02:57.958 --> 02:59.500
bartitsu?

03:00.625 --> 03:01.708
Of course.

03:01.958 --> 03:04.458
That's gymnastics in england.

03:04.958 --> 03:07.207
The Chinese teachings

03:07.208 --> 03:09.916
are warnings for the weak.

03:09.917 --> 03:11.750
For me,

03:12.375 --> 03:14.957
they lack imagination.

03:14.958 --> 03:16.499
What nonsense!

03:16.500 --> 03:17.917
I've had enough!

04:18.750 --> 04:19.916
Newspapers!

04:20.916 --> 04:22.292
Days off!

04:22.375 --> 04:23.042
Move.

04:23.043 --> 04:24.416
Days off!

04:24.417 --> 04:25.916
Race to the queen's road.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.332
Fireworks and rewards for the winners!

04:27.333 --> 04:29.125
I'm certain we'll make it.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.125
Ip man, hurry up.

04:36.750 --> 04:37.791
I got this!

04:37.792 --> 04:38.875
We're counting on you!

04:41.625 --> 04:42.666
Sorry.

04:42.667 --> 04:43.708
What the hell?

04:44.208 --> 04:45.832
Sorry. I'm sorry.

04:45.833 --> 04:47.125
Hurry up!

04:47.750 --> 04:48.708
Don't worry. We'll win.

04:48.709 --> 04:50.667
Don't let him win!

04:51.958 --> 04:53.208
You can't win.

04:59.292 --> 05:00.250
Hurry up.

05:00.251 --> 05:01.667
Hurry.

05:14.292 --> 05:15.042
Are you okay?

05:15.043 --> 05:16.167
Wait.

05:19.500 --> 05:20.667
Sorry.

05:21.375 --> 05:22.542
You know kung fu?

05:34.333 --> 05:36.042
Give me the bag! Do you hear me?

05:36.833 --> 05:38.166
- Stop it!
- Let go!

05:38.167 --> 05:40.457
Mom, let it be. Give it to him.

05:40.458 --> 05:41.666
What are you doing?

05:41.667 --> 05:42.792
Give me that.

05:43.875 --> 05:45.208
Sit down.

05:45.625 --> 05:46.625
Mom.

05:47.792 --> 05:49.583
Mom, let go.

05:50.583 --> 05:51.708
Don't move.

05:52.083 --> 05:53.042
Mom.

05:53.042 --> 05:53.875
Tell her to let go.

05:53.876 --> 05:55.583
Just give it to him.

06:00.417 --> 06:02.333
A robber in the daylight!

06:04.542 --> 06:05.792
Let him go.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.208
Bro, come on.

06:12.542 --> 06:13.667
There you go.

06:28.917 --> 06:29.958
Stop it there.

06:30.375 --> 06:32.875
Guys, teach him a lesson.

07:08.583 --> 07:09.750
Give me the bag.

07:14.542 --> 07:16.833
Sorry for the trouble
we've caused you, sir.

08:22.583 --> 08:23.833
Don't go.

08:24.167 --> 08:24.917
Try again.

08:24.918 --> 08:26.417
Bro, let's get him.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.458
Come on.

08:34.292 --> 08:35.042
Hurry.

08:35.043 --> 08:36.917
- This station?
- Yes.

08:38.042 --> 08:39.207
Is it your mom's first time in Hong Kong?

08:39.207 --> 08:41.125
Yes. First time.

08:43.667 --> 08:44.958
Run!

08:45.583 --> 08:47.041
- Thief!
- Stay out of it!

08:47.042 --> 08:48.625
Feng, thief!

08:50.292 --> 08:51.417
Keep an eye on my mom!

08:56.292 --> 08:57.375
Mom.

08:57.583 --> 08:59.166
Auntie! Auntie!

08:59.167 --> 09:00.792
Don't go there!

09:28.917 --> 09:30.749
Stop it. You shouldn't kill him.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.230
It's none of your business. Get lost.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.457
Play with fire

09:37.458 --> 09:38.917
and this is what you get.

09:40.875 --> 09:43.500
Mr. Hu, mahjong again?

09:44.333 --> 09:45.333
Look.

09:45.542 --> 09:48.083
How can you
miss out on mahjong, sir?

09:48.292 --> 09:49.500
It seems

09:49.708 --> 09:51.292
you've won.

09:54.333 --> 09:55.917
Stop pretending. Get up.

09:56.792 --> 09:59.667
Pay up to fix the problem.

10:03.458 --> 10:05.082
What about my share?

10:05.083 --> 10:05.875
That's all.

10:05.917 --> 10:07.667
- That's all?
- Yeah.

10:11.250 --> 10:12.250
Get lost.

10:17.458 --> 10:19.292
Now I've won. Dinner's on me.

10:21.958 --> 10:23.042
Go home.

10:23.583 --> 10:24.583
Go home. Go. Go.

10:25.667 --> 10:26.542
Alright.

10:26.583 --> 10:27.625
See you, sir.

10:31.083 --> 10:32.708
- Feng.
- Mom.

10:32.792 --> 10:34.500
Chan, are you okay?

10:34.542 --> 10:36.250
This brave young man saved us.

10:36.292 --> 10:37.333
It's nothing.

10:37.875 --> 10:38.958
Thanks, man.

10:39.417 --> 10:40.250
It's a small world.

10:40.250 --> 10:41.250
See you around.

10:41.542 --> 10:43.958
I'm feng. Mention my
name if in any trouble.

10:47.208 --> 10:48.625
Excuse me.

10:49.708 --> 10:51.958
Have you been to foshan?

10:53.250 --> 10:54.707
Liu, what's taking you so long?

10:54.708 --> 10:55.625
Coming.

10:55.626 --> 10:56.750
Give it here.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.458
Thanks.

10:59.417 --> 11:00.292
Look at you.

11:00.293 --> 11:04.541
Young master,
those losers deserved a good beating

11:04.542 --> 11:07.625
for bullying the weak.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.500
Let's be lenient wherever possible.

11:12.708 --> 11:13.750
Alright.

11:18.333 --> 11:19.417
Enjoy.

11:22.542 --> 11:24.542
Here you are.

11:27.292 --> 11:28.333
Young master,

11:28.625 --> 11:29.875
it's been eight years,

11:30.500 --> 11:32.180
and you still remember my favorite dishes.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.500
Of course.

11:35.542 --> 11:36.958
What brought you here?

11:37.583 --> 11:38.792
My mom needs a doctor.

11:39.917 --> 11:41.083
Is she okay?

11:42.167 --> 11:43.167
Same old, same old.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.625
Here.

11:50.333 --> 11:51.416
Young master,

11:51.417 --> 11:52.417
that's enough.

11:52.418 --> 11:54.167
I thought you loved spice.

11:55.542 --> 11:57.541
We fed on peppers because we lacked food.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.667
Not anymore.

12:00.625 --> 12:01.792
I see.

12:02.292 --> 12:05.208
Have you seen my daughter, cuihua?

12:11.958 --> 12:13.917
- Okay, thank you.
- Cigarettes.

12:14.417 --> 12:15.458
Sir, cigarettes?

12:17.292 --> 12:18.792
Cigarettes.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.083
Cigarettes.

12:24.417 --> 12:26.541
It happens all the time here.

12:26.542 --> 12:27.750
You can't help all of them.

12:28.750 --> 12:29.750
Is that

12:30.083 --> 12:31.250
what everyone believes?

12:35.083 --> 12:36.374
Young master,

12:36.375 --> 12:37.749
stay at my rickshaw yard tonight

12:37.750 --> 12:39.208
if you're not going back to foshan.

12:39.917 --> 12:42.457
A friend got me this work five years ago.

12:42.458 --> 12:43.874
Now, I have my own business

12:43.875 --> 12:44.957
with many buddies.

12:44.958 --> 12:46.582
Come with me and stay

12:46.583 --> 12:47.958
for the spring festival.

12:48.542 --> 12:49.542
Alright.

12:49.708 --> 12:50.708
Deal?

12:51.500 --> 12:52.750
Deal.

12:53.708 --> 12:54.667
Alright.

12:54.667 --> 12:55.583
Bottoms up!

12:55.584 --> 12:57.042
Cigarettes.

13:00.833 --> 13:01.833
Awesome.

13:06.958 --> 13:07.958
Watch it.

13:07.959 --> 13:10.167
I can't wait anymore.

13:10.292 --> 13:11.750
Sweetheart.

13:13.042 --> 13:13.958
Come on.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.167
What are you doing?

13:16.958 --> 13:18.083
Let me go!

13:18.625 --> 13:19.792
Come on.

13:20.292 --> 13:21.542
What's wrong with you?

13:30.292 --> 13:32.333
You rascal, let's go home.

13:36.208 --> 13:38.417
You rascal, where are you?

13:40.208 --> 13:41.417
Hello?

13:52.458 --> 13:54.542
Auspiciousness brings a bright future.

13:54.958 --> 13:55.958
Great name!

13:56.292 --> 13:57.125
I must

13:57.126 --> 13:59.249
redo the paint one day.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.374
I don't want to ruin my bright future.

14:01.375 --> 14:02.457
Very funny.

14:02.458 --> 14:03.916
What an honor to have you here

14:03.917 --> 14:05.374
at my rickshaw yard!

14:05.375 --> 14:06.542
Heho, feng.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.207
Shui, be careful up there.

14:09.208 --> 14:10.208
Alright.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.624
Young master, how do you say it?

14:12.625 --> 14:13.750
It's an "honor"?

14:13.917 --> 14:15.333
Yeah, that's right.

14:15.917 --> 14:16.917
Feng.

14:19.333 --> 14:20.542
Why are you up so late?

14:21.292 --> 14:22.875
I've been waiting for you.

14:24.917 --> 14:25.667
Young master.

14:25.668 --> 14:26.708
Let's go.

14:27.208 --> 14:28.500
Mind the steps.

14:29.583 --> 14:30.957
Bufeng,

14:30.958 --> 14:32.417
you're doing well.

14:32.750 --> 14:33.792
Thanks.

14:34.167 --> 14:35.957
Chan, this is young master,

14:35.958 --> 14:37.167
ip man.

14:37.250 --> 14:39.042
Young master,
this is chan, my sister.

14:39.958 --> 14:41.457
Talk while I get my room

14:41.458 --> 14:42.667
ready for you.

14:47.667 --> 14:48.667
Hello, ip man.

14:49.083 --> 14:50.208
Call him young master.

14:52.792 --> 14:53.792
Don't listen to him.

14:53.875 --> 14:55.083
Call me ip man.

15:06.250 --> 15:07.500
Nice to meet you, chan.

15:13.208 --> 15:15.042
The upper bunk is yours.

15:15.375 --> 15:16.667
Alright.

15:22.625 --> 15:23.625
Tomorrow,

15:23.792 --> 15:25.957
young master and I will take you around

15:25.958 --> 15:26.917
to show you the world.

15:26.917 --> 15:27.708
That's great!

15:27.709 --> 15:29.500
Let's see paintings and go to malls.

15:29.708 --> 15:30.708
Alright.

15:31.083 --> 15:32.603
I hope you don't mind my humble place.

15:32.875 --> 15:34.250
Not at all. It's very nice.

15:34.958 --> 15:36.167
Miss butterfly!

15:38.167 --> 15:39.833
Silly you! What are you doing?

15:40.417 --> 15:41.458
Don't hide it.

15:41.958 --> 15:43.708
I didn't know you were a fan.

15:44.958 --> 15:46.875
It's just for the humidity.

15:47.250 --> 15:48.583
I don't know her.

15:50.625 --> 15:51.874
Alright. It's getting late.

15:51.875 --> 15:52.957
Let young master rest.

15:52.958 --> 15:54.624
See you. Let's go.

15:54.625 --> 15:56.125
Young master, see you.

15:56.458 --> 15:58.833
Ip man, thank you for saving us.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.313
- Don't mention it.
- Were you scared?

16:06.583 --> 16:08.875
80 yuan

16:16.292 --> 16:17.458
So pricy!

16:24.625 --> 16:27.832
Miss, would you like to be an actress?

16:27.833 --> 16:29.792
A-Actress?

16:30.125 --> 16:31.874
We're talent scouts for a movie company.

16:31.875 --> 16:33.249
This is our business card.

16:33.250 --> 16:34.458
Here you are.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.249
Come for an interview when you're free.

16:39.250 --> 16:40.958
We'll pay you.

16:43.208 --> 16:44.291
Chan.

16:44.292 --> 16:45.625
Ip man.

16:45.958 --> 16:47.250
Let's go.

16:48.750 --> 16:50.291
Nice paintings.

16:50.292 --> 16:51.292
Yourfnends?

16:51.293 --> 16:52.916
They're talent scouts.

16:52.917 --> 16:54.458
Talent scouts?

16:56.375 --> 16:57.208
Where's my brother?

16:57.209 --> 16:58.750
Ice cream.

16:59.167 --> 17:00.167
Ice cream incoming.

17:00.168 --> 17:01.750
Here, chan, young master,

17:02.125 --> 17:03.042
take it.

17:03.043 --> 17:04.082
Alright.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.083
I just heard

17:05.084 --> 17:06.666
that miss butterfly is coming.

17:07.583 --> 17:09.957
Are actresses popular?

17:09.958 --> 17:12.916
Of course! They're popular
and they make big money.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.541
Young master...

17:16.041 --> 17:17.624
Miss butterfly is here!

17:17.625 --> 17:19.082
Miss butterfly! She's here!

17:19.083 --> 17:21.165
Hold it. Hold it. Miss butterfly!

17:21.166 --> 17:21.875
Bufeng.

17:21.876 --> 17:23.125
Miss butterfly.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.208
Miss butterfly is here!

17:25.875 --> 17:27.083
Miss butterfly!

17:27.583 --> 17:28.583
Miss butterfly!

17:29.625 --> 17:30.958
Miss butterfly!

17:31.917 --> 17:33.167
Miss butterfly!

17:34.583 --> 17:35.792
Miss butterfly!

17:35.917 --> 17:37.250
Miss butterfly!

17:39.625 --> 17:43.541
Even the yellow faces can be stars as well.

17:43.542 --> 17:46.750
There are two types of people,

17:47.458 --> 17:49.083
expensive

17:50.125 --> 17:51.708
and cheap.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.041
Check it out! Join our movie company

17:54.042 --> 17:55.499
and you'll be the next star.

17:55.500 --> 17:56.417
Check it out!

17:56.418 --> 17:58.082
Join us to be an actress.

17:58.083 --> 17:59.458
We're talent scouts.

18:09.208 --> 18:11.082
How are the new buyers?

18:11.083 --> 18:12.917
They need it in one week.

18:19.708 --> 18:20.875
Excuse me.

18:21.875 --> 18:22.999
Young master,

18:23.000 --> 18:24.499
even though kung fu helps,

18:24.500 --> 18:26.792
you're carrying too much weight.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.375
Just say that you want to drop me off.

18:30.708 --> 18:32.249
He's using twice the strength

18:32.250 --> 18:33.666
for a single job.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.208
What would you do if you were him?

18:36.208 --> 18:37.288
Madam, don't listen to him.

18:38.583 --> 18:41.375
Young man, you don't
look like a rickshaw man.

18:41.458 --> 18:42.833
He's not!

18:42.875 --> 18:43.708
Listen,

18:43.709 --> 18:45.916
this is
my young master serving you.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.833
Shut up. I'm not talking to you.

18:50.833 --> 18:51.875
Here we are.

18:51.958 --> 18:52.958
Here.

18:53.125 --> 18:54.375
Alright.

18:56.292 --> 18:57.208
Mind the steps.

18:57.209 --> 18:58.667
Okay, thank you.

19:01.583 --> 19:03.000
Young man,

19:03.458 --> 19:04.582
this is my business card.

19:04.583 --> 19:06.916
I'm sis liu.
Come to me for help if needed.

19:06.917 --> 19:08.250
I got your back.

19:09.000 --> 19:09.708
Let me see.

19:09.709 --> 19:10.958
Get lost.

19:13.667 --> 19:14.708
Hurry.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.082
Okay, I'm ip man.

19:17.083 --> 19:18.166
Nice to meet you.

19:18.167 --> 19:20.375
See you.

19:24.458 --> 19:25.500
Young master,

19:26.208 --> 19:28.375
only you have that kind of luck.

19:30.208 --> 19:31.708
I'm working for you.

19:31.750 --> 19:32.917
And you're making fun of me!

19:33.042 --> 19:33.833
Are you making fun of me?

19:33.958 --> 19:34.958
Are you?

19:35.125 --> 19:36.375
I also know wing chun.

19:36.833 --> 19:37.833
S-Stay back.

19:38.000 --> 19:38.542
Let's go.

19:38.543 --> 19:39.667
Go. Go.

19:41.833 --> 19:43.000
Here we go.

19:44.333 --> 19:45.792
Young master, easy.

19:46.292 --> 19:47.125
Young master,

19:47.126 --> 19:49.292
you should teach us wing chun.

20:01.333 --> 20:02.583
Young master,

20:02.917 --> 20:04.125
let's go.

20:05.333 --> 20:06.417
Quiet!

20:12.833 --> 20:14.207
Young master,

20:14.208 --> 20:15.500
those at the port

20:15.667 --> 20:17.375
work for the British.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.250
Don't mess with them.

20:19.625 --> 20:21.375
Or we'll get into trouble.

20:21.625 --> 20:22.667
Let's go.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.208
Young master.

20:24.667 --> 20:26.792
Young master.

20:39.000 --> 20:39.792
Move.

20:39.793 --> 20:41.167
Behave.

20:41.625 --> 20:42.999
- Over there.
- Let go!

20:43.000 --> 20:43.750
Over there.

20:43.751 --> 20:45.208
Wait.

20:46.083 --> 20:47.375
Who is that?

20:49.542 --> 20:51.250
Why are they tied up?

20:52.083 --> 20:53.207
Help me.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.499
Quiet.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.791
It is none of your business.

20:56.792 --> 20:57.958
Get lost.

20:58.583 --> 20:59.708
Stand up.

21:11.292 --> 21:12.667
I'm talking to you.

21:14.250 --> 21:15.375
You asked for it.

21:30.625 --> 21:32.458
Help.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.333
Mr. Liu.

21:37.958 --> 21:39.083
Mr. Liu.

21:39.833 --> 21:41.500
I've been looking for you.

21:42.583 --> 21:44.207
Stop fooling around.

21:44.208 --> 21:46.208
Secretary li asked me to get you home.

21:46.542 --> 21:47.667
Let's go.

21:47.917 --> 21:49.167
Who are you?

21:50.418 --> 21:52.500
I'm the head servant of the liu family.

21:53.417 --> 21:55.500
Detective liu is waiting for you at home.

21:55.542 --> 21:57.166
Young master, let's go home.

21:57.167 --> 21:59.083
Your dad is the detective?

22:00.583 --> 22:03.208
What? Does he have to
wear a name tag?

22:05.792 --> 22:06.750
Young master,

22:06.751 --> 22:08.167
let's go.

22:08.792 --> 22:12.083
Help us! Help us!

22:12.542 --> 22:13.666
Help us!

22:13.667 --> 22:15.875
Please!

22:17.792 --> 22:18.958
Let them go.

22:23.667 --> 22:24.750
Otherwise,

22:24.917 --> 22:26.833
I'll put you all in jail!

22:39.625 --> 22:41.000
Thank you.

22:41.875 --> 22:42.750
Drop it.

22:42.751 --> 22:43.791
Drop it now!

22:43.792 --> 22:45.083
Drop it.

22:48.875 --> 22:49.999
Young master.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.208
The detective's son?

22:58.625 --> 23:00.124
Can you tell me

23:00.125 --> 23:04.375
where the detective lives?

23:08.125 --> 23:09.292
Detective...

23:11.125 --> 23:12.500
Let's hear from you.

23:26.625 --> 23:27.625
Detective...

23:43.792 --> 23:45.250
- Feng.
- Young master.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.125
Are you hungry?

23:48.917 --> 23:51.292
Let's end this fast and go for food.

23:53.208 --> 23:54.375
It's on me.

25:03.125 --> 25:04.125
Young master.

25:26.625 --> 25:27.292
Young master.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.792
The girls are safe. Let's go.

25:45.250 --> 25:47.417
You think the police don't know about this?

25:47.875 --> 25:49.417
I know what you're trying to say.

25:56.792 --> 25:57.875
Slow down.

26:01.458 --> 26:03.667
Someone must stand up against injustice.

26:04.042 --> 26:06.292
There are rules to follow in Hong Kong.

26:06.625 --> 26:08.749
We should mind our own business.

26:08.750 --> 26:11.792
Are we still human
if we give up on justice?

26:12.208 --> 26:14.625
We can't give up kindness
and promote evil deeds.

26:15.583 --> 26:16.874
I know those teachings.

26:16.875 --> 26:18.833
But we have to be aware of our status.

26:19.042 --> 26:20.375
Those port people...

26:22.042 --> 26:22.958
Never mind.

26:22.959 --> 26:25.375
You bookworms are so stubborn.

26:28.125 --> 26:29.707
I'll take sole responsibility.

26:29.708 --> 26:31.958
If it bothers you, phleave.

26:35.375 --> 26:36.749
Don't even think about it.

26:36.750 --> 26:37.458
Let's go.

26:37.459 --> 26:38.707
I've got something nice for you.

26:38.708 --> 26:39.750
Sir.

26:40.167 --> 26:41.042
What is it?

26:41.043 --> 26:42.249
I'm not telling you.

26:42.250 --> 26:43.083
You'll find out.

26:43.084 --> 26:44.792
Mr. Hu, have some food.

26:44.917 --> 26:45.917
Rain check.

26:46.167 --> 26:47.291
Young master, let's go.

26:48.126 --> 26:49.375
Come on.

26:53.583 --> 26:54.708
Young master,

26:55.083 --> 26:56.625
race you there!

26:57.292 --> 26:58.250
Step aside.

26:58.251 --> 26:59.708
You're cheating!

26:59.750 --> 27:01.042
Watch out.

27:01.708 --> 27:02.417
Look.

27:02.458 --> 27:03.625
Go. You're leading.

27:04.500 --> 27:05.791
Let's go.

27:05.792 --> 27:06.957
Wing chun

27:06.958 --> 27:09.124
is a woman's fist,

27:09.125 --> 27:10.457
but it's so powerful.

27:10.458 --> 27:11.458
Huh?

27:11.833 --> 27:12.917
Huh?

27:14.958 --> 27:17.417
It's 10 pounds for one.

27:18.292 --> 27:19.624
So,

27:19.625 --> 27:21.208
it's 60 pounds for six.

27:21.750 --> 27:24.208
Find them

27:24.792 --> 27:28.292
or I'll sell your families
to make up for it.

27:28.667 --> 27:30.125
Do you hear me?

27:33.083 --> 27:34.250
I made it. I made it.

27:36.417 --> 27:37.417
Hurry up.

28:05.750 --> 28:06.583
Young master,

28:06.584 --> 28:07.792
how about this?

28:11.292 --> 28:12.333
Ip man.

28:13.500 --> 28:14.792
Happy minor spring festival!

28:15.167 --> 28:19.000
Happy minor spring festival!

28:20.500 --> 28:21.625
When did you set this up?

28:21.875 --> 28:23.375
Happy minor spring festival!

28:24.042 --> 28:25.082
Chan,

28:25.083 --> 28:27.667
why's the stake dressed up?

28:31.125 --> 28:33.667
I thought it might hurt ip man's hands.

28:36.042 --> 28:37.042
Ip man,

28:37.167 --> 28:38.458
teach us wing chun!

28:38.875 --> 28:40.332
- Yeah.
- Please teach us.

28:40.333 --> 28:41.083
Come on.

28:41.084 --> 28:42.292
Show us.

28:42.458 --> 28:43.916
Show us, please.

28:43.917 --> 28:44.792
You want to learn?

28:44.793 --> 28:45.999
Yeah. Ip man.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
We do.

28:47.208 --> 28:48.417
Show us! Show us!

28:48.625 --> 28:49.875
Let me show you, then.

28:50.375 --> 28:51.208
Come on.

28:51.209 --> 28:52.542
Show us.

28:54.583 --> 28:56.707
Wing chun has three forms.

28:56.708 --> 28:57.749
Sinking bridge.

28:57.750 --> 28:59.124
Thrusting fingers.

28:59.125 --> 29:00.500
Lhheldea.

29:39.083 --> 29:39.875
Watch it.

29:39.876 --> 29:41.125
Watch it. It's lit.

29:41.667 --> 29:43.667
Sweet dumplings!

29:44.167 --> 29:46.083
Come and have sweet dumplings.

29:56.083 --> 29:57.249
Chan,

29:57.250 --> 29:58.208
you should be impartial.

29:58.209 --> 29:59.833
Ip man is more worthy.

30:00.167 --> 30:01.999
Stop it,
or I'll teach you a lesson!

30:02.000 --> 30:03.082
- Bah!
- Come here!

30:03.083 --> 30:04.208
- Come here!
- Hey,

30:04.375 --> 30:05.167
watch it.

30:05.168 --> 30:06.499
Ip man, help.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.250
You're spilling the soup!

31:40.542 --> 31:43.583
A poem dedicated to this bowl of soup.

31:43.958 --> 31:47.083
The kitchen god is
reporting to heaven today.

31:47.500 --> 31:48.542
Please enjoy.

31:53.417 --> 31:54.875
Mr. Stark,

31:55.208 --> 31:57.875
you're going wild with your piglet business

31:58.208 --> 31:59.833
by snatching people in public.

32:00.375 --> 32:01.457
You're making things

32:01.458 --> 32:03.292
really hard for us.

32:08.083 --> 32:11.291
You've been doing a good job.

32:11.292 --> 32:13.749
And I believe

32:13.750 --> 32:15.583
you'll do even better.

32:19.125 --> 32:22.542
I'm afraid the new superintendent
disagrees with you.

32:22.875 --> 32:24.500
Are you referring to

32:25.250 --> 32:27.125
superintendent Weston?

32:27.333 --> 32:29.416
The governor of Hong Kong
has been concerned about

32:29.417 --> 32:32.082
the disappearance of Chinese recently.

32:32.083 --> 32:34.458
You're paying too little in management fees

32:34.958 --> 32:36.667
to cover oui' expenses.

32:36.875 --> 32:38.416
Superintendent Weston said that

32:38.417 --> 32:41.083
if you want to continue doing
business in Hong Kong,

32:41.417 --> 32:43.375
you should show some sincerity.

32:44.125 --> 32:46.791
He has felt

32:46.792 --> 32:48.792
my sincerity.

33:00.833 --> 33:02.625
Superintendent Weston's ring!

33:12.167 --> 33:13.500
Calm down.

33:14.167 --> 33:16.000
Peace makes prosperity.

33:16.250 --> 33:17.875
Let's eat.

33:23.208 --> 33:25.500
I didn't notice how pretty it is.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.167
Look. There.

33:27.250 --> 33:28.458
Chan, isn't it pretty?

33:28.625 --> 33:29.708
Yeah.

33:29.833 --> 33:30.916
Ip man,

33:30.917 --> 33:32.208
have some water.

33:32.875 --> 33:34.000
- Thanks.
- Feng.

33:34.208 --> 33:35.457
Thanks.

33:35.458 --> 33:37.041
- Chan.
- Listen, bufeng.

33:37.042 --> 33:38.666
We've been

33:38.667 --> 33:40.749
so busy with day-to-day life.

33:40.750 --> 33:41.417
Look.

33:41.418 --> 33:42.791
Sometimes, we should look

33:42.792 --> 33:44.917
at the sky and the world faraway.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.416
Our ancestors said

33:47.417 --> 33:49.624
that we should be down to earth

33:49.625 --> 33:51.166
and focus on

33:51.167 --> 33:52.500
living our lives well.

33:53.083 --> 33:55.667
Our ancestors
were too conservative.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.457
That's why the foreigners

33:57.458 --> 33:58.791
have taken over Hong Kong.

33:58.792 --> 34:00.875
We came from over there.

34:02.167 --> 34:03.958
I just want to

34:04.125 --> 34:06.041
provide for my family and friends.

34:06.042 --> 34:07.917
I won't seek to cause trouble.

34:08.292 --> 34:09.706
I don't care who's taking over.

34:09.708 --> 34:11.167
It's all the same.

34:13.667 --> 34:14.667
Is it?

34:18.292 --> 34:19.417
Isn't it?

34:23.917 --> 34:25.042
Iguessitis.

34:30.583 --> 34:32.206
How can I miss the clean-up

34:32.208 --> 34:33.583
of the minor spring festival?

34:34.708 --> 34:35.583
Honey,

34:35.583 --> 34:38.083
what a nice disciple of yours!

34:38.333 --> 34:39.333
If he shuns the work,

34:39.333 --> 34:41.083
I won't teach him kung fu.

34:44.042 --> 34:45.458
Watch it.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.958
Ip man, give me a hand.

35:23.417 --> 35:25.457
Ouch. Be gentle.

35:25.458 --> 35:27.917
Don't overdo it. Be moderate.

35:40.208 --> 35:42.042
Follow the move, not your hands.

35:46.417 --> 35:47.791
Use your mind, not your eyes.

35:47.792 --> 35:49.332
Practice your hearing.

35:49.333 --> 35:50.374
So slow!

35:50.375 --> 35:52.583
Honey, come out and help.

35:52.875 --> 35:54.208
Coming.

35:54.583 --> 35:55.625
Master,

35:55.875 --> 35:57.500
why are you so afraid of her?

35:59.083 --> 36:00.875
It's called respect.

36:07.750 --> 36:09.208
Yeah, whatever.

36:11.417 --> 36:12.708
Newspaper?

36:13.125 --> 36:13.792
Sure.

36:13.792 --> 36:14.667
Please.

36:14.668 --> 36:16.083
Spare me some coins.

36:17.375 --> 36:18.417
Thank you.

36:19.042 --> 36:20.250
Check it out.

36:22.250 --> 36:23.542
Check it out.

36:25.333 --> 36:26.542
Check it out.

36:27.958 --> 36:29.500
Newspapers. Newspapers.

36:30.708 --> 36:32.250
Get a newspaper.

36:34.042 --> 36:35.249
Get a newspaper.

36:35.250 --> 36:36.458
Newspapers.

36:41.167 --> 36:42.042
Feng.

36:42.043 --> 36:43.958
- Are you okay?
- Here.

36:44.792 --> 36:45.875
Feng.

36:45.958 --> 36:47.749
Feng, are you okay?

36:48.376 --> 36:49.583
- You...
- Shui.

36:51.958 --> 36:53.125
Stay back.

36:57.917 --> 36:59.083
This...

36:59.458 --> 37:00.708
This is my own business.

37:01.583 --> 37:02.750
Stay out of it.

37:03.208 --> 37:05.416
Who the hell are you
trying to be a "hero"?

37:05.417 --> 37:06.457
Are you risking your neck?

37:06.458 --> 37:08.457
How many times have I told you

37:08.458 --> 37:09.791
to mind your own business?

37:09.792 --> 37:11.249
I was trying to help.

37:11.250 --> 37:11.875
Yeah, right.

37:11.876 --> 37:12.957
You weren't helping.

37:12.958 --> 37:14.207
You were nothing

37:14.208 --> 37:15.417
but a punching bag.

37:15.458 --> 37:16.583
Alright. Alright.

37:17.042 --> 37:18.208
Go home.

37:19.583 --> 37:20.666
What's going on?

37:20.667 --> 37:21.750
They're fighting.

37:26.875 --> 37:28.458
Stop it.

37:33.083 --> 37:34.625
Isn't he the rickshaw guy?

37:39.333 --> 37:40.792
Now I will pay for one.

37:41.167 --> 37:42.250
Shut up.

37:52.458 --> 37:53.500
What do you want?

37:54.542 --> 37:55.542
Feng.

37:55.543 --> 37:56.875
- Stay back.
- Are you okay?

37:57.083 --> 37:58.625
Stay back.

37:59.125 --> 38:00.250
They want money.

38:01.667 --> 38:03.874
I did it, not them.

38:03.875 --> 38:05.457
How much do you want?

38:05.458 --> 38:06.583
A thousand pounds.

38:07.083 --> 38:08.375
Do you have the money?

38:09.083 --> 38:10.292
This is blackmail.

38:11.542 --> 38:12.708
If not,

38:12.792 --> 38:14.417
you're dead.

38:39.917 --> 38:41.332
That foreigner

38:41.333 --> 38:42.833
is a boxer.

38:44.250 --> 38:46.749
He's using British bartitsu.

38:46.750 --> 38:47.958
What's bartitsu?

38:48.167 --> 38:50.041
Mr. Barton-Wright combined

38:50.042 --> 38:53.207
boxing, jujutsu, and
wrestling into bartitsu,

38:53.208 --> 38:56.167
a martial art practiced
by the British upper class.

39:21.167 --> 39:22.583
Wreck this place.

39:35.292 --> 39:37.250
Excuse me.

40:58.625 --> 40:59.625
Feng.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.375
Shui.

41:06.875 --> 41:07.917
Let's go.

41:08.583 --> 41:09.750
Let's go.

41:25.708 --> 41:28.042
Shui.

41:28.375 --> 41:29.375
Help.

41:29.376 --> 41:30.417
Help!

41:30.625 --> 41:31.958
Shui.

41:32.583 --> 41:33.583
Come.

41:33.958 --> 41:35.458
Mom, are you okay?

41:35.708 --> 41:37.874
Take shui to the hospital.

41:37.875 --> 41:38.542
Shui.

41:38.543 --> 41:39.625
Stop!

41:43.708 --> 41:46.542
This is what you get for seeking justice.

41:48.167 --> 41:49.667
Look at this.

41:54.125 --> 41:55.125
Ip man.

41:55.500 --> 41:56.750
Is this justice?

41:57.375 --> 41:58.624
Is this righteousness?

41:58.625 --> 41:59.791
Bufeng,

41:59.792 --> 42:00.832
I started this.

42:00.833 --> 42:02.124
I'll take sole responsibility.

42:02.125 --> 42:03.125
How?

42:03.500 --> 42:05.333
What can you possibly do?

42:10.875 --> 42:12.208
Come, this way.

42:13.625 --> 42:14.708
Feng.

42:16.250 --> 42:17.458
He's looking for you.

42:17.750 --> 42:19.166
Y-Your sister

42:19.167 --> 42:21.250
is in danger!

42:24.917 --> 42:26.417
Stop crying!

43:40.250 --> 43:41.792
Another dead.

44:01.917 --> 44:02.957
Liu, liu.

44:02.958 --> 44:05.125
Do you remember
the young rickshaw man?

44:05.583 --> 44:06.833
Big news!

44:08.125 --> 44:09.374
Don't let the news spread.

44:09.375 --> 44:13.958
Extra: British boxer defeated by
wing chun master

44:16.792 --> 44:19.042
you didn't find all of them.

44:19.167 --> 44:21.583
As long as I found them...

44:33.542 --> 44:34.750
Freeze.

44:50.958 --> 44:52.167
Let my sister go.

45:36.875 --> 45:39.375
I've heard that you're quite the fighter.

45:40.375 --> 45:41.917
I ruined your business.

45:42.167 --> 45:43.125
Take me.

45:43.126 --> 45:44.292
Let his sister go.

45:53.208 --> 45:54.417
Okay.

46:07.792 --> 46:09.167
Either he

46:09.583 --> 46:11.292
or your sister dies.

47:13.500 --> 47:14.583
Stop.

47:16.042 --> 47:20.041
We should let the Chinese

47:20.042 --> 47:22.875
admire the bartitsu of Great Britain.

47:29.542 --> 47:30.666
In three days,

47:30.667 --> 47:32.500
we'll hold a fight in public.

47:33.042 --> 47:34.917
If you win,

47:35.333 --> 47:37.625
I'll let her go.

48:11.500 --> 48:12.999
Bufeng.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.375
Have faith.

48:14.708 --> 48:16.292
We can save chan for sure!

48:17.417 --> 48:18.708
How?

48:20.833 --> 48:22.167
By beating them.

48:26.042 --> 48:27.542
Thank you, young master.

48:37.125 --> 48:38.500
It's cold.

49:13.500 --> 49:14.832
Let's go home.

49:14.833 --> 49:16.833
Your mom is waiting.

49:20.375 --> 49:21.917
Go tell her the news.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.666
I'm getting some medicine for my buddies.

49:24.667 --> 49:25.625
Okay.

49:25.626 --> 49:27.375
The bill, please.

49:28.750 --> 49:30.083
Bufeng.

49:32.500 --> 49:33.708
Let me chip in.

49:52.875 --> 49:54.042
See you.

50:03.583 --> 50:04.708
I know

50:05.042 --> 50:06.625
that it's our fault.

50:07.750 --> 50:09.042
I promise

50:10.417 --> 50:11.542
I'll pay you back.

50:12.750 --> 50:14.167
Please let us off.

50:23.625 --> 50:25.000
I have savings.

50:26.792 --> 50:27.958
It may not be enough.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.542
I also have a business.

50:31.667 --> 50:33.375
I can give you everything.

50:35.167 --> 50:36.208
Please

50:37.042 --> 50:38.292
let us off.

51:26.875 --> 51:28.292
Enough.

51:35.875 --> 51:38.750
It's not about money anymore.

51:39.458 --> 51:43.208
To know oneself is true knowledge.

51:55.583 --> 51:58.708
You know what I want.

52:04.292 --> 52:05.667
Okay.

52:07.333 --> 52:09.125
My promise is under one condition.

52:10.250 --> 52:11.667
Let ip man off

52:13.083 --> 52:14.875
as well.

52:19.625 --> 52:20.583
Mr. Stark,

52:20.584 --> 52:22.875
what made you launch this contest?

52:24.458 --> 52:26.749
Some people have said

52:26.750 --> 52:28.624
that British bartitsu

52:28.625 --> 52:31.874
is no match for Chinese wing chun.

52:31.875 --> 52:35.250
I must prove that it's a misunderstanding.

52:37.083 --> 52:38.207
Master,

52:38.208 --> 52:39.625
look at this.

52:42.458 --> 52:43.874
You must remember

52:43.875 --> 52:46.667
to hold your camera real tight.

52:47.750 --> 52:49.749
I'm afraid I'll win so fast

52:49.750 --> 52:52.250
you won't even get to click the shutter.

52:52.833 --> 52:54.833
Wing chun against bartitsu?

52:59.458 --> 53:00.707
News! News!

53:00.708 --> 53:02.666
Wing chun against bartitsu!

53:02.667 --> 53:03.916
News! News!

53:03.917 --> 53:05.375
Get a newspaper.

53:05.583 --> 53:06.500
Check it out.

53:06.500 --> 53:07.375
Guys.

53:07.375 --> 53:08.208
Here.

53:08.209 --> 53:10.208
Wing chun against bartitsu.

53:10.292 --> 53:11.916
That'd be interesting.

53:11.917 --> 53:13.292
Not necessarily.

53:37.625 --> 53:38.958
This contest

53:39.208 --> 53:43.500
between bartitsu and wing chun

53:43.792 --> 53:47.083
is a friendly exchange.

53:47.875 --> 53:49.457
This contest

53:49.458 --> 53:53.041
between bartitsu and wing chun

53:53.042 --> 53:55.375
is friendly communication.

53:58.792 --> 54:00.082
Whoever

54:00.083 --> 54:01.792
gets off the stage

54:02.208 --> 54:03.125
of

54:03.126 --> 54:05.333
Pounds on the ground three times

54:05.708 --> 54:07.042
loses.

54:07.875 --> 54:09.500
Just surrender if you can't

54:09.750 --> 54:10.750
take it.

54:11.500 --> 54:13.625
We'll find another way to save chan.

54:14.125 --> 54:15.625
I got this.

54:18.125 --> 54:19.208
The contest

54:19.458 --> 54:20.749
may lead to death

54:20.750 --> 54:22.083
or injury.

54:22.375 --> 54:23.791
No one

54:23.792 --> 54:25.332
shall take

54:25.333 --> 54:27.208
any legal responsibilities.

54:27.792 --> 54:28.917
It's quite hot.

54:29.250 --> 54:30.083
Wipe your sweat.

54:30.084 --> 54:32.166
The contest may lead to death or injury.

54:32.167 --> 54:35.125
No one shall
take any legal responsibilities.

54:35.708 --> 54:37.416
I hereby announce that

54:37.417 --> 54:40.457
the contest between wing chun and bartitsu

54:40.458 --> 54:41.750
starts now!

54:42.500 --> 54:45.125
Yeah!

54:45.250 --> 54:48.042
Yeah!

54:48.250 --> 54:53.957
Yeah!

54:53.958 --> 55:00.542
Ip man! Ip man!

55:01.167 --> 55:03.292
Bartitsu!

55:40.417 --> 55:42.333
Wing chun, ip man.

56:08.375 --> 56:09.708
This is not good.

56:37.625 --> 56:39.083
Bravo! Bravo!

56:39.208 --> 56:39.958
- Bravo!
- Not bad.

56:39.959 --> 56:41.208
Well done!

56:41.583 --> 56:43.292
Well done!

56:49.583 --> 56:50.833
Sit tight.

57:06.458 --> 57:07.125
Master ip, what's wrong?

57:07.126 --> 57:08.166
Don't push it.

57:08.167 --> 57:09.167
Look.

57:09.833 --> 57:10.999
Something's wrong.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.083
No. Rest assured.

57:15.750 --> 57:16.832
There's something wrong with master ip.

57:16.833 --> 57:17.833
Yeah.

57:30.375 --> 57:31.667
Bravo!

57:32.542 --> 57:35.083
Get up, master ip.

57:35.625 --> 57:37.708
Get up, master ip.

57:38.333 --> 57:39.875
Young master, stop it.

57:40.083 --> 57:40.833
Master ip.

57:40.833 --> 57:41.583
Young master.

57:41.583 --> 57:42.292
Get up.

57:42.293 --> 57:45.417
Master ip. Master ip.

57:45.917 --> 57:50.333
Master ip. Get up.

57:53.333 --> 57:54.667
Stop it, young master.

57:54.917 --> 57:56.375
Master ip.

57:56.583 --> 57:59.791
Come on, master ip! Get up!

57:59.792 --> 58:01.875
Fight him!

58:02.250 --> 58:04.333
Bartitsu!

58:05.208 --> 58:06.333
Stop!

58:07.000 --> 58:08.208
Just stop!

58:09.125 --> 58:10.542
Young master!

58:14.875 --> 58:15.708
Yeah!

58:15.709 --> 58:16.958
That's the spirit!

58:22.833 --> 58:25.208
Kill him!

58:52.625 --> 58:53.958
You're here!

59:22.333 --> 59:23.333
Host,

59:23.458 --> 59:24.541
we give in!

59:24.542 --> 59:25.832
Stop it now, please!

59:25.833 --> 59:27.000
We give in!

59:45.667 --> 59:47.417
Stand up!

59:51.417 --> 59:52.874
Come on!

59:52.875 --> 59:54.042
Master ip!

01:00:00.083 --> 01:00:02.167
Young master.

01:00:02.667 --> 01:00:04.417
We give in!

01:00:04.917 --> 01:00:06.458
We are done fighting!

01:00:07.792 --> 01:00:08.875
Young master!

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:11.167
Get up!

01:00:11.333 --> 01:00:13.207
Get up, ip man!

01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:15.041
Come one, ip man!

01:00:15.042 --> 01:00:18.833
Ip man, get up!

01:00:23.875 --> 01:00:24.958
Hello, ip man.

01:00:25.417 --> 01:00:26.958
We can save chan for sure!

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:29.667
Ip man, help.

01:00:30.833 --> 01:00:32.457
Young master, this is all my fault!

01:00:32.458 --> 01:00:33.750
It's my fault!

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.750
Young master!

01:00:47.792 --> 01:00:48.792
Young master!

01:00:49.417 --> 01:00:51.166
Young master, please! Stop now!

01:00:51.167 --> 01:00:53.375
Do not continue!

01:00:55.667 --> 01:00:57.541
There you go! Get up!

01:00:57.542 --> 01:00:59.125
Get up, ip man.

01:00:59.667 --> 01:01:02.332
Young master!

01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:04.625
Ip man! Ip man!

01:01:05.708 --> 01:01:07.167
There you go!

01:01:08.167 --> 01:01:13.250
Ip man! Ip man! Ip man!

01:01:17.542 --> 01:01:18.957
Ip man! Ip man!

01:01:18.958 --> 01:01:20.083
Yeah!

01:01:21.333 --> 01:01:22.250
That's the spirit!

01:01:22.251 --> 01:01:24.167
There you go, ip man!

01:01:39.625 --> 01:01:43.917
Follow the move, not your hands.
Use your mind, not your eyes.

01:02:24.792 --> 01:02:28.250
Ip man, hit him! Hit him!

01:02:29.958 --> 01:02:37.958
Ip man! Ip man! Ip man!

01:02:48.875 --> 01:02:52.458
We won!

01:02:53.417 --> 01:02:56.292
He did it! We won!

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:02.208
Nice win, master ip!

01:03:02.209 --> 01:03:03.292
Hooray!

01:03:04.583 --> 01:03:06.541
Great! We won!

01:03:06.542 --> 01:03:08.458
Ip man!

01:03:08.833 --> 01:03:10.958
Yes! We won!

01:03:11.125 --> 01:03:13.167
Yeah!

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:24.875
Bufeng!

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:29.375
Bufeng!

01:04:08.583 --> 01:04:10.083
Control the fire!

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:41.166
Bufeng! Bufeng! Bufeng!

01:04:41.167 --> 01:04:42.667
Man!

01:04:43.333 --> 01:04:44.250
Master!

01:04:44.251 --> 01:04:45.583
Where is bufeng?

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:50.916
- Move!
- Move aside!

01:04:50.917 --> 01:04:52.417
Move! Move!

01:04:52.583 --> 01:04:53.875
What is it?

01:04:54.042 --> 01:04:55.042
They are here.

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:56.208
What...

01:04:58.917 --> 01:05:00.167
Move aside! Move!

01:05:00.833 --> 01:05:02.083
Get lost!

01:05:02.875 --> 01:05:04.042
Have you seen this guy?

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:07.083
Find him!

01:05:07.084 --> 01:05:08.250
Go go go!

01:05:10.583 --> 01:05:11.707
Over there!

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:12.708
Quick!

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:13.708
Move aside!

01:05:13.917 --> 01:05:14.917
Move!

01:05:15.333 --> 01:05:16.542
Move!

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:22.333
What are you doing?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.083
Go go!

01:05:29.417 --> 01:05:30.500
Amen!

01:05:35.333 --> 01:05:36.542
Let's go.

01:05:41.083 --> 01:05:41.750
Over there!

01:05:41.751 --> 01:05:43.000
Quick!

01:05:57.917 --> 01:05:59.874
Get them!

01:05:59.875 --> 01:06:00.875
They are on the run!

01:06:01.208 --> 01:06:02.292
Go get him!

01:06:12.875 --> 01:06:14.083
Master,

01:06:15.208 --> 01:06:16.667
is this my fault?

01:06:19.042 --> 01:06:21.250
If asking for justice is wrong,

01:06:21.667 --> 01:06:23.833
then this world would be hopeless.

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:27.750
Righteousness

01:06:28.042 --> 01:06:29.375
can be either forgotten

01:06:29.917 --> 01:06:31.750
or awakened.

01:06:32.833 --> 01:06:34.667
Forgetting is easy,

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:37.250
but

01:06:37.917 --> 01:06:39.249
for awakening,

01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:41.750
that's where you always pay the price.

01:06:47.167 --> 01:06:48.875
Chinese kung fu

01:06:49.625 --> 01:06:51.667
is not just about the moves.

01:06:52.167 --> 01:06:53.374
It contains

01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:56.208
the wisdom and spirit of Chinese culture.

01:06:56.958 --> 01:06:59.875
You have learned the spirit of justice,

01:07:00.833 --> 01:07:02.958
but pleading for justice

01:07:03.417 --> 01:07:05.958
requires good timing and chance.

01:07:06.292 --> 01:07:07.999
Moreover,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.708
wisdom and resourcefulness are needed.

01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:26.917
Feet!

01:08:27.542 --> 01:08:28.792
Feet!

01:09:14.125 --> 01:09:18.375
Rickshaw yard mystery explosion

01:09:49.875 --> 01:09:51.625
To my dearest master,

01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:56.458
what happened recently is all my fault.

01:09:58.167 --> 01:10:00.292
My actions were definitely not wise.

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:04.000
As you have said before,

01:10:04.875 --> 01:10:08.041
asking for justice and
awakening righteousness

01:10:08.042 --> 01:10:11.250
require wisdom and resourcefulness.

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:13.082
I, man,

01:10:13.083 --> 01:10:14.875
shall heed your words.

01:10:15.875 --> 01:10:18.583
I have decided to go save the others.

01:10:19.083 --> 01:10:20.708
Master, please do not worry about me.

01:10:21.625 --> 01:10:23.166
A true warrior

01:10:23.167 --> 01:10:25.041
shall have both wisdom and bravery,

01:10:25.042 --> 01:10:27.083
and let his spirit last long.

01:10:28.292 --> 01:10:29.417
Ip man

01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:39.583
Ms. Liu, this is ip man.

01:10:55.167 --> 01:10:56.542
We are all Chinese.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.125
I don't want to hurt you.

01:13:06.917 --> 01:13:08.207
You are the first Chinese

01:13:08.208 --> 01:13:10.000
who dares to confront me.

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.708
And you will be the last.

01:14:35.375 --> 01:14:36.917
Ip man!

01:15:16.917 --> 01:15:17.917
Go on, go!

01:15:18.250 --> 01:15:19.850
What are you looking at?
Behave yourself!

01:15:20.418 --> 01:15:22.833
Speed up!

01:15:38.833 --> 01:15:40.374
Ms. Liu, this is ip man.

01:15:40.375 --> 01:15:42.207
Ip man, you are awesome.

01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:43.249
Move move move!

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:44.875
Maybe you are trustworthy.

01:15:45.417 --> 01:15:47.374
The British have been selling our people

01:15:47.375 --> 01:15:49.042
at dock bb.

01:15:49.542 --> 01:15:51.500
That place was run by the British.

01:15:52.042 --> 01:15:52.833
That's right.

01:15:52.833 --> 01:15:53.833
This is a tough situation.

01:15:53.833 --> 01:15:54.625
Yeah, I know that.

01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:55.417
Breaking news! Breaking news!

01:15:55.418 --> 01:15:57.500
No other papers will
dare to report this piece!

01:15:57.833 --> 01:15:59.500
I wonder if you can work this out.

01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:04.041
Give back our Liberty!

01:16:04.042 --> 01:16:07.166
All men are created equal!

01:16:07.167 --> 01:16:10.707
Give back our Liberty!

01:16:10.708 --> 01:16:13.791
No violence!

01:16:13.792 --> 01:16:16.582
No oppression!

01:16:16.583 --> 01:16:20.917
No hegemonism!

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.291
We will thoroughly investigate
the dock and evil forces,

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:30.750
and return the truth to the people.

01:16:32.167 --> 01:16:34.124
Police are investigating
the human trafficking case

01:16:34.125 --> 01:16:38.375
rickshaw yard caught on fire

01:16:45.833 --> 01:16:46.833
Master, this way.

01:16:47.042 --> 01:16:48.768
What a bustling day!
People are waiting for you!

01:16:48.792 --> 01:16:50.041
Young master,
join us for the ribbon-cutting later!

01:16:50.042 --> 01:16:50.708
Sure.

01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:52.500
Chan, mom! Come on!

01:16:54.292 --> 01:16:55.666
Here, here!

01:16:55.667 --> 01:16:56.667
Here!

01:16:56.875 --> 01:16:57.667
Get around!

01:16:57.708 --> 01:16:58.957
Come one, let's cut the ribbon together.

01:16:58.958 --> 01:16:59.833
Come here, master!

01:16:59.834 --> 01:17:01.083
Come out!

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.583
Okay.

01:17:14.833 --> 01:17:15.833
Ms. Liu,

01:17:16.333 --> 01:17:18.292
how did you manage
to get people to the dock?

01:17:19.667 --> 01:17:22.027
I told them that miss butterfly was there,
shooting a movie.
