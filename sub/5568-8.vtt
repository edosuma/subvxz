at Steve and Connie's?

03:29.009 --> 03:30.576
Last year, I got the beak.

03:30.578 --> 03:33.145
That's why at huangsgiving,
we don't serve duck.

I'm just trying to...

18:57.303 --> 18:59.837
To make it all about you,
like you always do,

18:59.839 --> 19:03.841
with your car accidents,
your lyme diseases.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.943
My face was paralyzed
for a year!

19:05.945 --> 19:07.311
How convenient!

19:07.313 --> 19:09.013
Just admit it.

19:09.015 --> 19:11.649
Admit you wanted to ruin
my Thanksgiving.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.919
Yes! Because
Thanksgiving is<i> mine!</i>

19:14.921 --> 19:16.454
It's the one time
I get attention

19:16.456 --> 19:18.189
for the right reasons...

19:18.191 --> 19:21.325
Not because a car backed into me
or I pet the wrong deer

19:21.327 --> 19:23.995
or... Had a tattoo
get infected.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.597
I told you not to get a tattoo
at the airport.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.533
Why couldn't you
just let me have this?

19:28.535 --> 19:30.134
You have everything else!

19:30.136 --> 19:32.336
Your business is
semi-successful.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.205
Your marriage is solid.

19:34.207 --> 19:37.341
Wait... are you and Steve
<i>really</i> having trouble?

19:37.343 --> 19:39.544
It's been hard.

19:39.546 --> 19:42.346
He's just so annoying, you know?

19:42.348 --> 19:44.182
I know.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.850
We all know.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.518
I just want to punch his face.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.819
I know.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.521
And those whale shorts?

19:50.523 --> 19:51.989
I bought him those shorts.

19:51.991 --> 19:54.058
Are appropriate
for a man his age.

19:55.395 --> 19:59.630
I also know that he loves you
and Justin very much.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.333
You know what?

20:02.335 --> 20:04.635
<i>I'm</i> going to buy this fryer

20:04.637 --> 20:06.904
so I can bring it
to your house next year,

20:06.906 --> 20:08.906
when you host Thanksgiving.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.741
No!

20:10.743 --> 20:13.010

will be great.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.381
Don't be silly.
Let me.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.663
You have to be married to Steve.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.593
What a beautiful table.

20:28.595 --> 20:31.696
Honey's taking the bonnet
off the gravy boat.

20:31.698 --> 20:32.997
What is she...

20:32.999 --> 20:34.365
Oh, my God!

20:34.367 --> 20:36.400
She's putting it on her thumb!

20:39.405 --> 20:40.405
Hm.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.506
Thanks for introducing me
to ska.

20:42.508 --> 20:43.241
I hate it.

[<i> Ska music plays</i> ]

20:46.179 --> 20:48.779
You tie a rope to a tire,
hang it from a tree,

20:48.781 --> 20:51.382
and just... Throw.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.751
I'm not gonna do that,
but thank you.

¶ Turn around, Connie ¶

20:57.023 --> 20:59.023
it's so catchy.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.092
It's about wanting you
to turn around.

21:05.698 --> 21:08.232
Thank you, ma-ma.

You're not mad that I got drunk
and messed everything up?

21:16.609 --> 21:19.310
Oh, I'm mad.
I'm super-mad.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.445
