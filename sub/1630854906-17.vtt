And then Donald Ressler.

41:26.776 --> 41:28.396
Blair Foster
told me about him.

41:28.444 --> 41:31.824
He’s connected to Cooper
and his task force.

41:31.864 --> 41:35.454
For years, in the early 2000s,
Ressler was the Special Agent

41:35.493 --> 41:39.333
in charge of the hunt
for Reddington.

41:39.372 --> 41:41.252
All roads
lead to Reddington.

41:41.290 --> 41:44.670
Yeah. He’s the key.
They’re all connected to him.

41:44.711 --> 41:47.671
All these years, we’ve never
been able to catch him.

41:47.714 --> 41:49.424
This is why.

41:49.465 --> 41:50.925
Raymond Reddington

41:50.967 --> 41:55.347
has corrupted a task force
within the FBI.

41:55.388 --> 41:58.388
And I’m gonna tear it apart
at the joints.
