[School bell rings]

00:07.907 --> 00:11.777
Mmm! Ahh!

00:11.779 --> 00:15.047
Mm-hmm! Mm-mmm!

00:16.716 --> 00:18.751
[Burps] Oh!

00:18.753 --> 00:20.519
Alrighty, then.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.989
Ugh! Just lost
my appetite.

00:23.991 --> 00:26.291
Same here. Ron.

00:26.293 --> 00:27.091
Face stuffing. Why?

00:27.093 --> 00:30.963
Uh, there is no why
in double cheese pizza day.

00:30.965 --> 00:32.064
Cheese!

00:32.066 --> 00:33.866
But it's cardboard caf pizza.

00:33.868 --> 00:36.702
Cheese on cardboard
is still cheese.

00:36.704 --> 00:37.402
Got you there.

00:37.404 --> 00:40.672
Ready for thirds?
Me, me! Me, me!

00:40.674 --> 00:44.676
Can you hold
the crust this time?

00:44.678 --> 00:47.946
Huh. The dream is over.
Aw!

00:47.948 --> 00:50.849
Wha...
[Moaning]

00:50.851 --> 00:53.619
Aah! Help! Aah!

00:53.621 --> 00:55.087
Cafeteria lady
cut you off again?

00:55.089 --> 00:57.289
Yes, but that's not
why I'm wigged.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.089
Too much cheese.

00:58.091 --> 01:01.994
Whoa, K.P. first, there's no
such thing as too much cheese,

01:01.996 --> 01:03.996
and second...
[Students screaming]

01:03.998 --> 01:07.866
Those aren't the usual mystery
meat screams, ladies.

01:10.036 --> 01:12.871
See? See? That's
just... that's not right!

01:12.873 --> 01:17.810
Ok, agreed. Whatever it is,
it's writing something.

01:17.812 --> 01:20.846
In mystery meat gravy?
Uhh!

01:20.848 --> 01:23.115
R-o-n. Uh-oh.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.715
Please tell me it's
writing Ron Rieger.

01:24.717 --> 01:26.085
Please tell me it's
writing Ron Rieger.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.053
You know, that kid
who's always cutting gym.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.254
This could be about that.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.689

01:30.691 --> 01:33.625

Oh, yeah? Well,
works for Ron Rieger.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.164
Whatever you saw today
couldn't have been a ghost.

02:45.166 --> 02:49.301
I mean what kind of ghost
communicates with mystery meat gravy?

02:49.303 --> 02:51.970
Huh. That's
the real mystery.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.339
Aah! Aah! It's back!

02:54.341 --> 02:56.141
Ron, shadow.

'Cause it's my... aah!
[Snorts]

Aah!

03:03.951 --> 03:05.450
Ha ha ha!

03:05.452 --> 03:11.223
See ya tomorrow. I'll have Wade
check out your gravy ghost.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.965
I'm not taking any
chances, buddy. Buddy?

03:22.135 --> 03:23.769
Heh heh! Hello.

03:23.771 --> 03:24.469
[Straining]

03:24.471 --> 03:28.207
Why do we even have a cat door?
We don't own a cat.

03:28.209 --> 03:32.144
All right,
we're safe. Aah!

03:32.146 --> 03:33.779
Stoppable-San.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.480
Y-Yori?

03:35.482 --> 03:36.080
Ohh!

03:36.082 --> 03:38.183
I am sorry if I startled you.

03:38.185 --> 03:39.818
Pfft! That? No. I was

03:39.820 --> 03:42.287
just practicing my...
Screams of courage.

03:42.289 --> 03:45.190
The Yamanouchi school
needs your courage once more.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.826
I come to you in a time
of great need.

03:47.828 --> 03:48.626
Sensei is missing.

03:48.628 --> 03:52.164
In his empty quarters,
we found this.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.100
Hmm? Ohh! Monkey!

03:55.102 --> 03:59.037
I'm gonna go out on a limb
here and say Monkey Fist.

03:59.039 --> 03:59.837
Better tell Kim.

03:59.839 --> 04:02.074
Have you forgotten your
solemn vow never to reveal

04:02.076 --> 04:04.109
what took place
during your visit to Japan?

04:04.111 --> 04:06.144
Oh, right.
The thing with the vow

04:06.146 --> 04:10.249
and the not telling about the
secret ninja school, huh? Aah!

04:11.884 --> 04:14.886
It's... it's...

04:14.888 --> 04:16.121
sensei?

04:16.123 --> 04:18.357
Stoppable-San.

04:19.792 --> 04:21.460
Oh!
[Growls]

04:21.462 --> 04:22.160
Oh!

04:22.162 --> 04:24.896
Sensei is using
his powers to contact you.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.265
Oh, yeah, sure.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.532
You know, why pick up a phone

04:27.534 --> 04:28.632
when you can just terrify?

04:28.634 --> 04:31.803
It is as I feared.
Monkey Fist seeks revenge.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.940
You proved your bravery once
by saving the lotus blade.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.409
Now you must do
the same for sensei.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.111
Well, if I can't
tell Wade or Kim,

04:39.113 --> 04:41.246
how am I supposed
to track Monkey Fist?

04:41.248 --> 04:43.348
You are too modest a hero.
Do not worry.

04:43.350 --> 04:46.885
The Yamanouchi school has many
graduates who can assist.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.320
Wade: Don't know
what to tell you, Kim.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.355
After watching the
cafeteria security tape,

04:50.357 --> 04:52.524
I can't explain what
happened yesterday, either.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.826
Did you analyze
the gravy sample?

04:54.828 --> 04:55.526
Yep.
And?

04:55.528 --> 04:57.095
You don't want to know.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.864
Not till after graduation.

04:58.866 --> 04:59.564
From college.

04:59.566 --> 05:02.000
I say we trust him
on the gravy.

05:02.002 --> 05:05.037
Got the nacos, plenty of diablo
sauce and cinna-snackies.

05:05.039 --> 05:06.171
Mm-hmm! Yummy.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.240
Sneaking Bueno Nacho
into school?

05:08.242 --> 05:11.176
Hey, K.P. no, just
picked up some snacks

05:11.178 --> 05:13.178
for a, um, field trip.

05:13.180 --> 05:13.878
Field trip?

05:13.880 --> 05:15.514
Everything is ready,
Stoppable-San.

05:15.516 --> 05:20.085
Yori?! Ha ha! Uh, Yori,
this is Kim and Monique.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.219
Oh!
Kim Possible!

05:21.221 --> 05:22.921
I have heard much.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.356
Really? I haven't.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.891
Oh, sure, K.P.

05:25.893 --> 05:29.261
You know Yori from
seventh-period history.

05:29.263 --> 05:33.165
No, no, she's an old pal
from camp Wannaweep.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.334
We've never met
actually. What you want?

05:35.336 --> 05:37.836
Who are you,
stranger I do not know?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.271
But you just said
her name is Yori.

05:39.273 --> 05:43.208
Yori. Well, it's a common
name, you know, in Japan.

05:43.210 --> 05:46.178
Well, I...
I gotta go. Bye!

05:46.180 --> 05:47.346
Huh. Weird.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.047
Secret girlfriend weird?

05:49.049 --> 05:50.849
No. He'd tell me.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.284
I mean, why wouldn't he?

05:52.286 --> 05:54.152
Because you'd go all jel.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.620
Jel?
Green-eyed.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.589
So? I've always
had green eyes.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.925
Jealous.
You're jelling.

05:59.927 --> 06:00.925
I am not jelling.
Uh-huh.

06:00.927 --> 06:04.629
It's just that my weirdar
is going off, that's all.

06:04.631 --> 06:08.166
And you're jelling.
So not!

06:08.534 --> 06:10.335
[Kimmunicator beeps] Go, Wade.

06:10.337 --> 06:14.106
I did some checking like you
asked about Ron's girlfriend.

06:14.108 --> 06:15.340
Friend.
Who's a girl.

06:15.342 --> 06:16.908
Wade!
Ok, ok, friend.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.643
So what are the stats?
There aren't any.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.379
I can't find anything
about her at all.

06:20.381 --> 06:23.081
No, that can't be. There's
gotta be something.

06:23.083 --> 06:23.781
School records?

06:23.983 --> 06:27.785
I'll do a global scan.
Give me a half-hour.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.554
[Plane flying]

06:29.556 --> 06:33.225
Lord Monkey Fist was last
seen in South America.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.359
Aah!

06:34.361 --> 06:36.495
Right there
in the amazin' rain forest.

06:36.497 --> 06:41.099
Ha! Always with the American-style
jokes, Stoppable-San.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.902
Of course it is
the Amazon rain forest.

06:43.904 --> 06:44.902
Right, and it's amazing.

06:44.904 --> 06:48.140
We think it may be where
Monkey Fist is holding sensei.

06:48.142 --> 06:51.643
Oh, man. All the flights
to South America are booked.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.979
Do not concern yourself.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.214
Aah!

06:58.084 --> 07:01.520
Secret ninja tickets?

07:01.522 --> 07:02.220
Heh! Yes.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.523
Our ninja graduates
are here to help.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.058
Well, could they help
carry some of the bags?

07:07.060 --> 07:10.328
Ha ha! Again with the
American-style joking.

07:10.330 --> 07:13.432
Naturally it will be your
honor to carry them.

07:13.434 --> 07:17.602
Right, right,
I remember. My honor.

07:17.604 --> 07:18.703
[Kimmunicator beeps]

07:18.705 --> 07:19.903
Chem class, Wade.
Little busy.

07:19.905 --> 07:22.274
I did some more digging on Yori.
Go.

07:22.276 --> 07:25.510
I scanned all known public and
private school records. Nothing.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.045
Ok, how hinky is that?

07:27.047 --> 07:28.947
Uh, Kim, eyes
on the beaker here.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.449
And get this.
Flight records show

07:30.451 --> 07:32.517
that Yori and Ron
went to South America.

07:32.519 --> 07:35.687
I knew something was up.
I'm on my way.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.656
Kim! Aah!

07:37.658 --> 07:41.326
Red's, um, a good look for you.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.462
That's right, girl.
You better run!

07:43.464 --> 07:47.232
According to the map,
we should be very near.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.032
Whoa! Oh, good.

07:48.034 --> 07:52.370
Then it will be my honor to
collapse from exhaustion.

07:52.372 --> 07:56.308
Ohh. [Snoring]

07:56.310 --> 07:58.677
Hmm! [Chatters]

07:58.679 --> 08:00.645
What? This is
my honor nap.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.548
Rufus-San is right. There
is something in the jungle.

08:03.550 --> 08:09.120
Well, I don't see any...
ohh! Monkey!

08:12.258 --> 08:14.626
The knuckle-dragging ying

08:14.628 --> 08:17.128
to my knuckleheaded yang.

08:17.130 --> 08:20.031
Waah! Hyah! Oh...

08:20.033 --> 08:21.666
ow! Ow! Ow ow!

08:21.668 --> 08:25.136
Ohh! You have found
the signpost that leads

08:25.138 --> 08:29.140
to Monkey Fist's
hidden headquarters there.

08:30.409 --> 08:35.013
Oh! Stupid
monkey statue.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.314
Aah!

08:36.316 --> 08:37.516
Kim: Thanks for the lift,
Ricardo.

08:37.518 --> 08:38.616
<i>De nada, Señorita Possible.</i>

08:38.618 --> 08:43.088
After all, you saved my chicken farm
when you dried up that mudslide.

08:43.090 --> 08:47.092
No big. One of the reasons I
carry a cordless hair dryer.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.226
[Beeps] Go, Wade.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.795
Ok, Yori doesn't go
to any known schools,

08:50.797 --> 08:52.163
so I checked into the unknown.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.099
Heh! And I thought
I could do anything.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.734
Does Yamanouchi mean anything?

08:55.736 --> 08:58.336
That school in Japan
that Ron went to last year?

08:58.338 --> 09:00.238
Turns out it's
a super secret school.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.707
I knew he crushed on someone
while he was there.

09:02.709 --> 09:06.144
That wasn't what I...
what? You think I'm jelling.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.579
I'm not jelling!
Why would I jel?

09:07.581 --> 09:11.082
Right. Anyway, the school
was founded by a warrior

09:11.084 --> 09:14.119
who carved the monastery from a
Mountain using only a sword.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.787
Well, if you want
to do things the hard way.

09:15.789 --> 09:19.257
And here's the kick. The sword
uses mystical monkey power.

09:19.259 --> 09:22.227
Ron has mystical monkey power.
You don't suppose...

09:22.229 --> 09:25.263
Monkey Fist has tried to take
the power from him before.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.265
So you think Yori's
working for Monkey Fist.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.768
Did I say that?
No, I did. It's a theory.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.503
It's kind of jumping
to a conclusion.

09:31.505 --> 09:33.305
Well, that's what
theories are, right?

09:33.307 --> 09:34.739
Man, you <i>are</i> jelling.

09:34.741 --> 09:38.376
Ugh! Now, that's
conclusion jumping.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.782
That is way beyond wrong.

09:43.784 --> 09:44.816
Huh? Oh!

09:44.818 --> 09:46.785
Shh. Monkey Fist
may be near.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.120
We must be careful
as we proceed.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.122
Oh, right. Sorry.

09:51.124 --> 09:54.859
Don't tell me. It'll be
my honor to go first.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.869
[Monkey screech]
Uh-oh!

10:04.871 --> 10:08.607
Uh-oh? What uh-oh? Uh-oh.

10:09.175 --> 10:12.410
Aah! Poison
monkey teeth!

10:12.412 --> 10:15.180
It is a trap!

10:15.448 --> 10:19.250
[Grunting]

10:20.186 --> 10:22.621
Hyah! Oh! Hyah!

10:23.389 --> 10:25.223
Whoaah!

10:25.225 --> 10:27.292
Aah!

10:31.397 --> 10:33.798
Whoa! Whoa! Aah!

10:33.800 --> 10:35.834
Aah!

10:36.569 --> 10:38.203
Unh!

10:39.839 --> 10:43.708
Unh! Ha!
Well, at least...

10:43.710 --> 10:45.243
[pants rip]

10:45.245 --> 10:46.211
Ugh! Nothing.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.513
Heh heh heh!
Oh, Stoppable-San!

10:48.515 --> 10:50.415
You make danger
comical with your

10:50.417 --> 10:52.584
American-style
buffoonery.

10:52.586 --> 10:53.818
Heh!

10:53.820 --> 10:57.355
Hello! Monkey Fist?

10:57.556 --> 11:00.992
It's empty. You know what? I'm
done with all the monkey stuff.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.695
A little howler
goes a long way.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.797
There is no sign of sensei.

11:05.799 --> 11:06.397
Aw!

11:06.399 --> 11:09.434
Oh, hey! You know,
don't worry. We'll find him.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.536
There's gotta be a clue
around here somewhere,

11:11.538 --> 11:15.807
like, um... This!
It's a piece of straw!

11:15.809 --> 11:18.510
How about that, huh?

11:18.512 --> 11:21.179
Um, a cup. Frond.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.682
Lamp. Spider.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.484
Aah! Unh!

11:26.486 --> 11:28.753
Stoppable-San,
your antics have found

11:28.755 --> 11:30.288
the clue we have been needing.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.557
A map?
For a zoo.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.959
Rufus, do you see what I see?

11:34.961 --> 11:35.860
Churros!

11:35.862 --> 11:38.963
Mm-mmm! Ha ha ha!
Churros!

11:38.965 --> 11:40.363
Monkey Fist must
have sensei there.

11:40.365 --> 11:43.768
Where better for a monkey man to
hide than with other monkeys?

11:43.770 --> 11:48.773
Uh, this zoo's all the way in Arizona.
How are we gonna...

11:50.342 --> 11:52.444
uh-huh. Yeah, it's nice
of these guys to pick us up,

11:52.446 --> 11:57.348
but where were they when we were
fighting off all the monkey teeth?!

11:59.585 --> 12:02.954
Ok, I'm down. Looks like
Monkey Fist's tree house.

12:02.956 --> 12:06.391
Wade: Kim, I retriangulated
my tracking on Ron and...

12:06.393 --> 12:06.991
don't tell me.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.927
Yeah. Sorry.
He's not there.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.863
Looks like he's headed for somewhere
in the American southwest.

12:11.865 --> 12:16.668
Oh, what? Is this Yori girl
dragging him around the world?

12:16.670 --> 12:18.336
Hmm. Sounds familiar.

12:18.338 --> 12:22.006
Keep tracking!
I'm on my way.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.309
It appears closed.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.010
Closed?
It's out of business!

12:26.012 --> 12:27.979
Aw, no churros!

12:27.981 --> 12:29.247
[Sobs]

12:29.249 --> 12:30.882
Why did we even come here?

12:30.884 --> 12:33.952
Other then saving sensei,
of course!

12:33.954 --> 12:35.620
Notice it's always
"monkey house,"

12:35.622 --> 12:37.989
never "monkey home."
That says a lot.

12:37.991 --> 12:38.789
What does that say?

12:38.791 --> 12:40.689
I don't know. Just pointed
it out, that's all.

12:40.691 --> 12:44.462
Something's inside. Your bravery is needed.
It will be your...

12:44.464 --> 12:47.298
yeah. Yeah, I know
the honor drill.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.403
Ohh! Stay back!
Time for some smack monkey.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.339
Ooh! Hyah...

12:54.341 --> 12:56.541
oh, hey, no, wait!
Aah! Aah!

12:56.543 --> 12:58.777
I'm gonna need those back!
Stoppable-San?

12:58.779 --> 13:02.514
Ron! K.P., what are you doing?

13:02.516 --> 13:04.382
Rescuing you. Nice try.

13:04.384 --> 13:07.418
Whoa. Are you freaking
over my friend Yori?

13:07.420 --> 13:10.288
I am not freaking!
I am not jelling...

13:10.290 --> 13:10.988
jelling?
Jelling?

13:10.990 --> 13:12.690
What's jelling?
Never mind jelling.

13:12.692 --> 13:15.760
Your <i>friend</i> Yori is
working with Monkey Fist.

13:15.762 --> 13:20.298
Ha! No, she's just my... she... what
was the last thing I told you?

13:20.300 --> 13:23.034
You may tell her.
Really? You're sure?

13:23.036 --> 13:23.934
She's sure. Spill.

13:23.936 --> 13:27.739
Well, sensei, the master
of the Yamanouchi school,

13:27.741 --> 13:30.074
which is a secret ninja
school, by the way,

13:30.076 --> 13:32.744
is missing, and we think
Monkey Fist is behind it.

13:32.746 --> 13:35.980
Ninja school? That
explains the magic sword.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.482
The lotus blade?
Oh, that is

13:37.484 --> 13:39.717
so last season, K.P.
you gotta get current.

13:39.719 --> 13:42.387
Stoppable-San
is a great hero.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.721
During his visit to Yamanouchi,

13:43.723 --> 13:47.659
he saved the lotus blade
and defeated Monkey Fist.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.661
Ron? Stoppable-San?

13:49.663 --> 13:50.995
Dig it, K.P.
I'm a hero.

13:50.997 --> 13:54.833
Master of the mystical monkey power.
Awah!

13:54.835 --> 13:55.433
Hyah! Unh!

13:55.435 --> 13:59.804
Again we call upon his
bravery to help find sensei.

13:59.806 --> 14:02.407
We think he may be
held in this zoo.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.443
Ok, I'm in.
Let's start.

14:06.111 --> 14:09.881
Ah! Heh heh. Hmm.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.749
Huh?

14:11.751 --> 14:15.687
Aah! [Chattering]

14:15.689 --> 14:18.089
Ron: Monkey Fist!
Aah! You?!

14:18.091 --> 14:19.757
What are you doing here?

14:19.759 --> 14:20.992
We are here for sensei.

14:20.994 --> 14:21.692
That relic?

14:21.694 --> 14:24.229
What value could he
possibly be to me?

14:24.631 --> 14:30.034
But... but if you didn't
capture sensei, who did?

14:30.036 --> 14:31.603
Aah!

14:36.408 --> 14:37.876
Whoa. Big monkeys.

14:37.878 --> 14:40.011
Apes. Don't you mean "yipes?"

14:40.013 --> 14:42.413
No, apes.
They're apes.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.148
Ron: Yipes!

14:44.150 --> 14:48.119
You fools! You led them right to me!
I was hiding!

14:48.121 --> 14:52.090
Hiding? From what?
From that!

15:02.868 --> 15:07.405
Hey, nice place.
Dungeon motif, very goth.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.441
Unh!
Oof!

15:10.443 --> 15:13.011
[Grunts]

15:13.740 --> 15:15.147
This is all your fault!

15:15.148 --> 15:18.449
Oh, you know what, dude?
Don't even start.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.984
After sharing a crate
through the jungle

15:19.986 --> 15:22.787
I'm in no mood for
your monkey-tude.

15:22.789 --> 15:26.024
Oh! Hyah!

15:26.026 --> 15:27.659
Ooh-yah!

15:27.661 --> 15:28.893
Everyone chill.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.061
We are not alone.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.663
You are correct, Yori.

15:31.665 --> 15:35.967
Sensei! I'm... Relieved
to see that you are well.

15:35.969 --> 15:39.203
To truly be well, one
must also be free.

15:39.205 --> 15:40.972
I got your message, sensei.

15:40.974 --> 15:44.175
But the writing in gravy.
I would've used ketchup.

15:44.177 --> 15:47.078
You're the ghost
that Ron saw at school.

15:47.080 --> 15:50.615
It was my wish to warn
Stoppable-San to stay away,

15:50.617 --> 15:52.583
that he was in great danger,

15:52.585 --> 15:56.220
but I failed. Even
the strongest oak

15:56.222 --> 15:57.755
one day must fall.

15:57.757 --> 16:00.725
Oh, spare us
your senseless babbling.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.060
We have to find
some way out of here.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.862
Oh, come on. Why you
always gotta be hating?

16:04.864 --> 16:06.497
Sensei's got nothing but love.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.199
It's all good.
It's all good.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.568
Sorry to agree
with Monkey Fist,

16:10.570 --> 16:12.036
but we should
probably try to...

16:12.038 --> 16:15.707
escape?
I won't allow that!

16:15.709 --> 16:16.307
Not at all!

16:16.309 --> 16:20.678
I demand to know what it is
that you want... With him!

16:20.780 --> 16:23.114
Me?! Uh-uh! You!

16:23.116 --> 16:26.217
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Aah! Cut it out!

16:27.720 --> 16:29.854
Enough! It was
an easy plan.

16:29.856 --> 16:32.757
When monty hid from me.
I used sensei as the bait,

16:32.759 --> 16:35.760
making it appear that
Monkey Fist was responsible.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.830
I knew that only his archfoe
could lead me to him.

16:38.832 --> 16:42.066
Check me, K.P.
I'm an archfoe.

16:42.068 --> 16:45.069
You're not an archfoe.
You're an archbumbler.

16:45.071 --> 16:47.672
But Stoppable-San
did defeat you.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.942
On several separate
occasions. Thank you.

16:50.944 --> 16:53.044
What exactly is going on here?

16:53.046 --> 16:56.714
What is going on is that
I have what I want!

16:56.716 --> 17:00.918
Oh! Unh! Unhand me,
you brutish thugs!

17:00.920 --> 17:03.154
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!

17:03.156 --> 17:03.854
All: Ohh!

17:03.956 --> 17:06.658
Since I have no need
for the rest of you,

17:06.760 --> 17:08.693
I'll say good-bye!

17:08.695 --> 17:09.827
Aah!

17:09.829 --> 17:13.164
And as for you, monty...

17:13.166 --> 17:16.067
aah!

17:20.039 --> 17:22.206
Aah!

17:29.181 --> 17:30.715
Aah!

17:30.717 --> 17:32.917
Gotcha!

17:32.919 --> 17:35.920
Where's sensei?

17:38.690 --> 17:41.192
Gone.
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:41.194 --> 17:41.892
[Sobs]

17:41.894 --> 17:45.964
It is good to see that
you are all safe.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.165
What? How?

17:47.167 --> 17:50.134
Oh, right! I forgot.
Sensei can do

17:50.136 --> 17:52.970
that mystical floaty thing.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.976
Ok, now he's just showing off.

17:59.111 --> 18:03.181
So do you want to tell me again
exactly why we're going back?

18:03.183 --> 18:05.016
Because it's
the right thing to do.

18:05.018 --> 18:07.051
A weed that never grows

18:07.053 --> 18:09.987
does not need to be cut down.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.889
Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's
a good gardening tip.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.189
So why are we doing this again?

18:13.191 --> 18:16.027
What sensei is saying is even
though Monkey Fist is bad,

18:16.029 --> 18:20.098
he has not done us wrong this day.
It is our honor to save him.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.667
Oh, we're rescuing the bad guy.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.970
Yeah, but it sounds better
the way he says it.

18:27.139 --> 18:28.940
Unh!

18:28.942 --> 18:30.808
What is it
you want? Unh!

18:30.810 --> 18:33.277
It's simple.
I... Want...

18:33.279 --> 18:35.046
let him go.

18:35.048 --> 18:37.782
Waah! Hyah! Ah-so!

18:37.784 --> 18:39.684
Yeah, that's right.
We're back!

18:39.686 --> 18:41.819
And we're saving the monkey.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.888
Boo-ya!

18:43.890 --> 18:46.357
Get them!

18:47.292 --> 18:48.693
Unh!

18:48.695 --> 18:51.829
[Roars]

18:51.831 --> 18:53.097
Hyah! Hyah hyah!

18:53.099 --> 18:56.267
Heh heh heh.
Oh! Unh!

19:00.005 --> 19:01.939
Grr!

19:01.941 --> 19:04.308
[Roars]

19:07.012 --> 19:10.915
Unh! Let go!

19:10.917 --> 19:13.818
Grr!

19:21.894 --> 19:24.862
Yaah!

19:27.299 --> 19:29.033
Unh!

19:33.005 --> 19:35.106
Ron: Aah!

19:41.780 --> 19:44.982
Aah! K.P!

19:46.151 --> 19:47.418
How about a lift?

19:47.420 --> 19:49.820
It would be my honor.

19:55.961 --> 19:58.729
Aah!

19:58.731 --> 19:59.343
Unh! Grr!

20:07.005 --> 20:11.075
Aah! No!

20:11.077 --> 20:12.476
Oh! DNAmy.

20:12.478 --> 20:15.746
This goes beyond sick and wrong.
It's wrong-sick.

20:15.748 --> 20:19.817
See, sweetums? Just like I
gave you monkey hands and feet

20:19.819 --> 20:22.119
I gave myself
gorilla arms and feet.

20:22.121 --> 20:26.057
All for you! Oh,
monkey pudding and pie!

20:26.059 --> 20:28.359
Dude, I think you're on a date.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.127
That's impossible.
It was purely

20:30.129 --> 20:32.029
a professional relationship.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.865
Ooh! You keep
saying that,

20:34.867 --> 20:37.134
but I know you don't mean it.

20:37.136 --> 20:38.169
Ooh, come here!

20:38.171 --> 20:40.238
No! Get back!
Stay away!

20:40.240 --> 20:44.976
No fair hiding! You're my
newest little cuddle-buddy!

20:44.978 --> 20:46.744
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Where are... oh!

20:46.746 --> 20:50.448
Come here! Mommy's gonna get you!
Yes, she is!

20:50.450 --> 20:53.117
Wrong-sick.
That's what I'm saying.

20:53.119 --> 20:57.154
Stoppable-San, again you
have proven your bravery.

20:57.156 --> 21:00.124
Thanks to you and Kim Possible,

21:00.126 --> 21:03.561
I may return
to the Yamanouchi school.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.329
Sorry if I harshed
on you earlier.

21:05.331 --> 21:07.832
So what exactly is the sitch

21:07.834 --> 21:10.201
between you
and Stoppable-San.

21:10.203 --> 21:12.036
A bond of honor.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.071
Yeah, great, but...

21:14.073 --> 21:17.808
Stoppable-San, until
the day we again meet.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.176
Heh heh heh heh!

21:19.178 --> 21:24.115
Yeah! That was Japanese
for good-bye.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.050
Ha ha!
Oh, Stoppable-San!

21:26.052 --> 21:27.852
You with
your American-style

21:27.854 --> 21:31.222

21:46.038 --> 21:48.873
You really don't
understand girls, do you?

21:48.875 --> 21:52.977

girls make it more obvious.

Well, you got me.

21:58.251 --> 22:01.552
Why can't the ladies
just say how they feel?

22:01.554 --> 22:02.620
Mm-mm-mmm.

22:02.622 --> 22:05.156
