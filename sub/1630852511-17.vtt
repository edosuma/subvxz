- Bye, friends.

36:41.166 --> 36:42.098
We love you.

36:42.167 --> 36:43.266
Are we the Beatles?

36:43.335 --> 36:44.434
- Well, we made some
noise in El Paso.

36:44.503 --> 36:45.368
- Oh, hell yeah.

36:45.437 --> 36:46.636
It was like electric.

36:46.705 --> 36:47.704
- Yeah, I couldn't have
asked for a better show.

36:47.773 --> 36:48.772
- Oh was amazing.

36:48.840 --> 36:49.973
- I think I might
be a little drunk.

36:50.042 --> 36:50.974
[burp]

36:51.043 --> 36:52.075
Oh, my--

36:52.144 --> 36:53.276
- Ooh, I've been
doing that all day.

36:53.345 --> 36:54.578
- Put me to bed.

36:54.646 --> 36:55.779
- The boys are going to
hate us when we get home.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.981
- Yo.
leep[b

36:58.050 --> 36:59.082
Should we just go
somewhere else?

36:59.151 --> 37:01.084
- We're in rare form.

37:01.153 --> 37:03.653
- Just when you
think the meatballs

37:03.722 --> 37:05.589
have drowned in the sauce.
- Hey, can you gag me?

37:05.657 --> 37:06.590
I need to throw up tonight.

37:06.658 --> 37:07.958
- Mm-hmm.

37:08.026 --> 37:10.126
- One of them resurfaces
and revives the whole group.

37:10.195 --> 37:11.127
You know what I'm saying?

37:11.196 --> 37:12.128
<i> [upbeat music]</i>

37:12.197 --> 37:13.230
- Tear the roof off this bitch.

37:13.298 --> 37:15.799
- Uh, uh, uh.
- Come on.

37:15.867 --> 37:18.335
God, I just burped up tacos
from like two days ago.

37:18.403 --> 37:21.238
- I think I have bedbugs.

37:21.306 --> 37:24.774
I'm like composed, right?

37:24.843 --> 37:27.644
Honestly, I probably would
be really happy on Mars

37:27.713 --> 37:28.812
with my family.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.947
- I wonder what
the boys are doing.

37:31.049 --> 37:32.515
- The vibes, the whole
trip was amazing.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.451
- Mm-hmm.
- And then she called.

37:34.519 --> 37:35.952
And it was like a little
bit of a black cloud.

37:36.054 --> 37:37.387
I mean, that was--

37:37.456 --> 37:39.856
there's no denying
that happened.

37:39.925 --> 37:43.126
- Whee!
[laughter]

37:43.195 --> 37:44.794
Oh, you lost my straw.

37:44.863 --> 37:45.929
- Your straw is right there.

37:46.031 --> 37:48.698
[bleep].

37:48.767 --> 37:50.133
- Are we on a hill?

37:50.202 --> 37:51.134
- No.

37:51.203 --> 37:52.302
- No, no, we're flat.

37:52.371 --> 37:53.770
- Well, then why are my things
popped?

37:53.839 --> 37:57.807
- Cause you got whacked, bitch.

37:57.876 --> 37:58.842
- Oh, my God.

37:58.910 --> 38:00.810
- [screaming]

38:00.879 --> 38:02.445

38:07.319 --> 38:08.351

38:08.420 --> 38:09.986
I think I might have
to go to the ER.

38:10.055 --> 38:13.390
She [bleep] punched
me in the throat.

38:13.458 --> 38:14.624
- Oh, my God.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.726
Are we in Italy with
these cobblestones?

38:16.795 --> 38:17.761
Oh, my God.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.162
My skirt.

38:19.231 --> 38:21.998
Oh!

38:22.067 --> 38:23.800
- Did you see me?
- Yes.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.568
- Pauly [bleep] killed it.

38:25.637 --> 38:26.670
- Yeah, that [bleep] exploded.

38:26.738 --> 38:27.671
- I'm not gonna lie.

38:27.739 --> 38:29.072
I'm a little drunk.

38:29.141 --> 38:30.073
- Oh, yes.

38:30.142 --> 38:31.074
- Whoo!

38:31.143 --> 38:32.242
- OK.

38:32.311 --> 38:34.511
I haven't had this
much fun in so long.

38:34.579 --> 38:37.314
- That is how you
shut down El Paso.

38:37.382 --> 38:39.182
- I'm' so proud.
- El Paso, we love you.

38:39.251 --> 38:40.984
- All right, meatballs.

38:41.053 --> 38:42.452
[indistinct].

38:42.521 --> 38:44.254
- I got to get my shoes off
because they're killing me.

38:44.323 --> 38:46.222
- Love you.
- Love you.

38:46.291 --> 38:47.757
- We're going to bed.
Pardon.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.159
- Are we going to bed?

38:49.227 --> 38:51.494
<i> - So going to bed right</i>
<i> now, I feel complete.</i>

38:51.563 --> 38:53.363
<i> We had a great</i>

38:53.432 --> 38:54.464
<i> It felt like old times.</i>

38:54.533 --> 38:57.500
Like we took El Paso by storm.

38:57.569 --> 38:59.002
<i> This was one of the best</i>
<i> trips we've ever been on.</i>

38:59.071 --> 39:00.904
<i> Now it's time to go to bed.</i>

39:00.972 --> 39:02.305
- Tonight was a fun night.

39:02.374 --> 39:03.406
It was great.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.508
I think it's time
for me to go to bed.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.143
- What are we going to
do about the [bleep] owl?

39:07.212 --> 39:08.745
- Yo, I don't kill animals.

39:08.814 --> 39:11.114
But that will be the first
[bleep] animal I take out

39:11.183 --> 39:12.115
is that [bleep] owl.

39:12.184 --> 39:13.750
- I might punch it in the face.

39:13.819 --> 39:17.053
- We couldn't sleep last night
because this [bleep] owl.

39:17.122 --> 39:19.022
Hoot, hoot, hoot, hoot.

39:19.091 --> 39:20.023
- The whole [bleep] night.

39:20.092 --> 39:21.157

All [bleep] night.

39:36.742 --> 39:37.841

39:37.943 --> 39:39.776
- It was like, hoot, hoot.

39:39.845 --> 39:42.512
- I swear to God, if I hear it
tonight, I'm running outside.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.147
- I'm like, oh, my God.

39:44.216 --> 39:45.415
- I feel like, if
we hear it tonight--

39:45.484 --> 39:46.516

- Listen.

39:50.322 --> 39:51.421
Quit trying to sleep.

39:51.490 --> 39:53.156
So we brought our
German shepherd today.

39:53.225 --> 39:54.157
- Yeah.

39:54.226 --> 39:55.392
- Woof!

39:55.460 --> 39:57.227
- I feel like this is
a really good plan.

39:57.295 --> 39:59.662
- It's going to be amazing.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.598
- [laughs]

40:01.666 --> 40:04.434
- We're telling owls not
to mess with us tonight.

40:04.503 --> 40:05.468
I'm trying to scare them away.

40:05.537 --> 40:07.470
- Now, I'm like, you know--

40:07.539 --> 40:09.506
they were--
- What is on your lip?

40:09.574 --> 40:11.241
- Get the [bleep] out of here.

Situation, a changed man?

40:59.357 --> 41:02.792
- Oh, damn, how dare you
come at Big Daddy Sitch?

41:02.861 --> 41:05.595
- He knows that he stirred
this whole [bleep] thing up.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.030
- I think Angelina's
gonna give it to him.

41:07.098 --> 41:08.598
- I know.
- Oh, [bleep].

41:08.667 --> 41:10.200
- Today, I'm gonna
make sure he respects

41:10.268 --> 41:11.468
me because I'm [bleep] done.

41:11.536 --> 41:15.305
- Just when I thought
I was out, old Sitch,

41:15.373 --> 41:16.606
they bring me back in.
