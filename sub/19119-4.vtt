WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.303
-Previously on Outsiders...

00:02.303 --> 00:04.205
- First off, we've blocked
access to the town.

00:04.205 --> 00:06.107
I propose we fence off
mountain trails

00:06.107 --> 00:07.341
we know the Farrells use.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.676
We're also going to post
armed guards

00:08.676 --> 00:10.078
at places
the Farrells have raided.

00:10.078 --> 00:12.180
-I am Moregon,
and we're the Kenna.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.348
We come from the shadow side
of this mountain.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.550
-So, you have no men among you.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.219
How do you maintain
your number then?

00:18.219 --> 00:20.088
-When it's time
for such things,

00:20.088 --> 00:21.689
men are easy enough
to come by.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.659
(banging on bars)

00:25.659 --> 00:27.795
MAN: Hey Ron, you got one

00:27.795 --> 00:28.796
for the infirmary right here.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.298
-I have cancer.

00:30.298 --> 00:32.233
WADE: It's my sister.
She was Breece's wife.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.767
HAYLIE:
Well, would you look at that.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.237
Looks like I was wrong
about when Breece started here.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.239
Your sister should be covered
in a couple of days.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.674
-I don't know how I ever
thought this could work.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.343
I don't ever want to
see you again.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.478
-What's this?
Got a damn pregnancy test.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.080
I told you
to stop seein' him.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.422
(gasps)

00:54.422 --> 00:57.258
-I killed my mother.
-(crowd gasps)

00:57.258 --> 00:58.492
EMELYE:
If the Bren'in agrees,

00:58.492 --> 01:01.629
you, Foster Farrell VI,
are banished.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.197
-The Bren'in will think on it

01:03.197 --> 01:05.099
and render a decision
at a later time.

01:07.635 --> 01:10.604
(crowd murmuring)

01:26.554 --> 01:28.689
-The Big Foster we all know,

01:28.689 --> 01:31.425
there's little need
to number his sins.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.361
There's only one fate
for that man.

01:35.496 --> 01:36.497
Banishment.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.531
-(in unison)
Yeah.

01:37.531 --> 01:40.501
(all in agreement)

01:47.541 --> 01:49.543
-But what of this new
Big Foster?

01:49.543 --> 01:51.779
The one who stood
before all of us

01:51.779 --> 01:55.916
and openly admitted
the most heinous of crimes...

01:55.916 --> 01:57.785
the murder of his own mother.

02:01.589 --> 02:05.359
This new Big Foster
is not the same,

02:05.359 --> 02:07.661
and with the world below
plottin' to crush us

02:07.661 --> 02:10.798
and take our home,
what sense does it make

02:10.798 --> 02:13.667
to send away
our most dedicated warrior?

02:16.404 --> 02:19.807
Respect to the wisdom
of the elders.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.942
But he stays among us.
There will be no banishment.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.244
-(in unison)
No!

02:23.244 --> 02:26.214
(loud disagreement)

02:31.285 --> 02:33.187
-(pounds on table)
On my knees, Bren'in,

02:33.187 --> 02:35.423
I looked up at that man.

02:35.423 --> 02:40.361
On my knees, over the black,
empty eye of a gun barrel

02:40.361 --> 02:43.197
and said farewell
to all I treasure--

02:43.197 --> 02:47.301
my mountain, my memories,
my family--

02:47.301 --> 02:51.439
I support your decision,
as clan law dictates I must.

02:51.439 --> 02:54.642
But in my heart,
(pounds table) never!

02:54.642 --> 02:56.577
-(in unison) No!

02:56.577 --> 02:58.212
-Bren'in!

02:58.212 --> 03:00.214
-Take the cylchorah
to speak, Shurn.

03:00.214 --> 03:03.484
-All propers and all due.
My lovin' boy

03:03.484 --> 03:07.321
would be here at my side,
livin' and breathin'

03:07.321 --> 03:09.923
if it weren't for that devil
and his sick ambitions.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.292
-Shurn, the cylchorah.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.527
-Whose child dies next
'cause of him?

03:13.527 --> 03:14.928
And when that child dies,

03:14.928 --> 03:17.498
the fault falls
on your head, Bren'in.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.533
-Do not think that because
you know me as healer,

03:19.533 --> 03:21.735
you can talk to me
for who I was.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.739
My word will be respected!

03:32.346 --> 03:37.918
-As one takes the cylchorah,
so the others fall silent.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.254
That is custom.

03:40.254 --> 03:43.724
There is no better way
to destroy a clan

03:43.724 --> 03:45.459
than to turn
against the Bren'in.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.984
(country blues music)

04:13.053 --> 04:13.954
* The dawn is up *

04:13.954 --> 04:17.024
* There's fire on the mountain *

04:17.024 --> 04:21.028
* They'll have to answer
for their crooked claim *

04:21.028 --> 04:24.665
* The hollows
they'll surround them *

04:24.665 --> 04:27.000
* And they'll go running back *

04:27.000 --> 04:30.338
* To the wretched realm
they came *

04:32.806 --> 04:39.012
* Nor will the dogs of hell
refrain *

04:39.012 --> 04:44.485
* And the land will suffer
those who came. *

04:51.725 --> 04:54.695
(birds chirping)

05:03.537 --> 05:06.507
(heavy breathing)

05:09.843 --> 05:10.811
-Are we almost there?

05:28.729 --> 05:29.997
-Hey, Caleb was sniffling
a little bit

05:29.997 --> 05:31.399
on his way upstairs.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.633
You might wanna have
the school nurse

05:32.633 --> 05:33.767
take a look at him today.

05:33.767 --> 05:34.802
It's probably nothin'.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.373
Abby has play practice
'til 5:15.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.141
If my meeting goes long,
I might need you to pick her up.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.109
Does that work?

05:44.945 --> 05:46.414
Wade?

05:46.414 --> 05:47.748
-Yeah, whatever.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.818
-Okay. You're mad at me.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.589
You think
I'm bein' selfish.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.125
-Oh, it doesn't matter
what I think...

05:58.125 --> 05:59.727
obviously.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.703
-Cousin, hold up.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.109
-What you want?

06:16.109 --> 06:18.512
-I wanna give my sorry.

06:18.512 --> 06:21.815
The same as I'm gonna do
for all the others I've wronged.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.016
-Well, if that's your intent,

06:23.016 --> 06:24.151
you're gonna be
frightful occupied

06:24.151 --> 06:25.986
for the next couple of years.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.588
-I was sick.

06:27.588 --> 06:32.793
Robbed of reason,
but I'm better, now...

06:32.793 --> 06:37.998
and I'm ready to right my wrongs
and serve my family.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.600
-I'm ready to be
a tall, handsome man

06:39.600 --> 06:41.569
with regular-size ears.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.104
That ain't likely
to happen neither.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.973
-A man can change.

06:45.973 --> 06:50.844
-A man, yes.
A monster, hmmpf, no.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.599
HASIL: There ain't gonna be
no more jackanapin' around.

07:11.599 --> 07:14.902
Bren'in, she's countin' on us
to keep watch down below,

07:14.902 --> 07:17.805
and we are gonna do it proper
from this moment on.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.040
-It ain't half funny
how you preachin' down on us

07:20.040 --> 07:21.241
when you're the one
who come back

07:21.241 --> 07:22.776
with a mouse under his eye.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.944
HASIL:
Goin' to hellfire for it.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.579
(laughter)

07:25.579 --> 07:28.616
-This ain't the time for
foolishness and for prankin'.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.551
Now maybe y'all need a reminder,

07:30.551 --> 07:32.486
but the town's lawmen,
they was just up here,

07:32.486 --> 07:34.988
right up into the heart of us
without a word of warnin'.

07:34.988 --> 07:38.191
Now it is our job to make sure
that that does not happen again.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.828
What are y'all lookin' at?
You even listenin' to me?

07:47.901 --> 07:49.069
C'mere.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.205
(indistinct whispering)

07:56.076 --> 07:57.811
Here, you're here.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.615
-Looks that way.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.267
I'm glad
you're happy to see me.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.069
Yeah.

08:22.069 --> 08:25.505
I was worried.
Thought you'd be mad at me.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.809
-No, I wasn't mad at you.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.277
-No?
-No.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.512
I was worried
more than anything.

08:36.316 --> 08:39.186
Seein' how you told me that
we ain't got nothin' in common,

08:39.186 --> 08:40.821
I gotta say...
-I know what I said, Hasil.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.259
The truth is...

08:46.259 --> 08:48.862
that we...
got something in common.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.665
(snicker)

08:51.665 --> 08:52.766
-What's that?

08:54.568 --> 08:55.736
-I'm pregnant.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.749
You're not gonna say anything?

09:11.785 --> 09:13.821
(scoffs) Wow.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.357
I had a lot of time to think

09:17.357 --> 09:20.928
(sighs)
while we were walkin' up.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.864
About how'd you react and...

09:23.864 --> 09:28.235
I guess I was hopin'
that maybe you'd... be happy.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.171
-I--I'm just
supposed to be happy?

09:33.173 --> 09:35.108
I'm dealin' with
serious matters here.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.745
I--I'm dealin' with--
with your people

09:37.745 --> 09:39.246
attackin' my family.
-My people?

09:39.246 --> 09:41.615
-I'm dealin' with Big Foster
who's back among us,

09:41.615 --> 09:44.685
and he's--he's tickin' away
like a time bomb.

09:44.685 --> 09:47.254
And my Bren'in,
she's relyin' on me.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.758
For the first time in my life,
I am necessary here.

09:50.758 --> 09:54.327
-I am so sorry that this is
an inconvenience for you,

09:54.327 --> 09:56.129
'cause the timin'
is just perfect for me.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.065
-Hey, hey, hey!
I'm sorry.

09:58.065 --> 10:01.168
Look, I ain't gonna
let you wander off again.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.703
-Let me?
-Yeah.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.805
-Don't pretend
to be concerned about me

10:04.805 --> 10:07.007
because clearly
you only care about yourself

10:07.007 --> 10:09.309
and your dumbass family.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.244
-So, what, you just
gonna go home then?

10:15.282 --> 10:17.384
-I can't!

10:17.384 --> 10:18.886
Because James found out.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.055
I can't go home!

10:22.055 --> 10:23.891
-(sobs)
-Come here.

10:23.891 --> 10:26.293
-Aw, come here.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.995
-(sobs) You're bein'
a real dick to me.

10:27.995 --> 10:31.031
-I'm sorry. I'm just...

10:31.031 --> 10:33.834
I'm a little overwhelmed
right now, that's--that's all.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.971
Look at me.

10:37.971 --> 10:38.939
Hey.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.209
It's gonna be all right.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.816
Just have to ponder on
what we're gonna do.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.217
(sighs)

10:53.787 --> 10:55.255
-I was thinkin'
I'd take care of it.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.924
-Of course, you're gonna
take care of it.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.826
It's your child.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.260
-No, Hasil.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.864
Take care of it...
as in get rid of it.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.434
-No!

11:07.434 --> 11:11.071
Hey!
That child's half a Farrell.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.175
And he's gonna be born
half a Farrell.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.014
-That's what I hoped you'd say.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.785
-Are you hungry?
-(Sally-Ann sniffles)

11:24.785 --> 11:26.353
-Let's get you
somethin' to eat.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.022
-He's high on his horse,
bossin' down on us.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.158
-And we gotta be
all serious now.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.761
Skinny little
eight-fingered tinpot!

11:33.761 --> 11:35.362
-You know, how 'bout this?

11:35.362 --> 11:37.197
How 'bout we take
this little run in town

11:37.197 --> 11:38.932
and grab us some cold beers?

11:38.932 --> 11:40.834
That sounds a mite better
than walkin' that fool fence,

11:40.834 --> 11:41.969
doesn't it?
-Why, it surely does,

11:41.969 --> 11:43.103
but how we gonna get
around that fence?

11:43.103 --> 11:44.237
-Well, I know me a spot.

11:44.237 --> 11:47.040
We just do us a little diggin'
and squeeze on under.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.943
As long as
you suck in that gut!

11:49.943 --> 11:51.411
-Thank you, Hezzy,
I will get this organized

11:51.411 --> 11:53.180
as soon as possible.
I promise you.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.422
(knock on door)

12:02.422 --> 12:03.390
-Yes.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.295
-You called for me, Bren'in?

12:08.295 --> 12:11.865
-Yes. I wanted to thank you
for speakin' up the way you did.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.835
I sorely needed to hear
a friendly voice in that moment.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.304
-They don't understand,
do they?

12:17.304 --> 12:19.439
How difficult it is to lead.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.174
They're children,

12:21.174 --> 12:24.077
wailin' like pups
when a decree displeases them.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.779
-(sighs)

12:25.779 --> 12:28.015
-I'm encouraged to see
that your power is...

12:28.015 --> 12:30.050
undiminished
by their yowlin'.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.455
We're true leaders,
you and I.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.192
Quartz rock
in our blood and bones.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.363
Trust me to defend you,

12:43.363 --> 12:44.998
should the need
ever arise again.

12:49.036 --> 12:51.138
As a subject to your Bren'in,

12:51.138 --> 12:53.440
shouldn't you think a knock
to announce yourself

12:53.440 --> 12:55.375
would be the least
consideration to offer?

12:55.375 --> 12:57.477
-I surely agree.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.580
Thing is I sometimes forget
that she's my Bren'in,

13:00.580 --> 13:02.349
and look on her as my wife.

13:03.951 --> 13:08.421
Thing about bein'
an old married couple...

13:08.421 --> 13:10.090
you get to be all informal.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.061
You ever married, darlin'?

13:14.061 --> 13:18.398
-I've been accused of many
crimes in my lifetime.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.868
But keepin' a man from his wife
is not amongst them.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.004
I take my leave.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.072
Thank you, Bren'in.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.173
-Thank you.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.180
-That lady
gives me the creeps.

13:33.180 --> 13:36.516
-Is trouble the only language
your tongue knows?

13:36.516 --> 13:37.918
What do you want?

13:37.918 --> 13:39.920
-I gotta find my boy.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.922
I've been back near
a day and a half.

13:41.922 --> 13:45.425
Tracker such as he is,
he shoulda been right behind me.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.127
-He will be back.
-Oh?

13:47.127 --> 13:49.096
What about that fence
you told me of?

13:49.096 --> 13:50.363
What if he's caught
on the other side,

13:50.363 --> 13:52.065
can't find passage around?

13:52.065 --> 13:52.933
Could be he's hurt.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.102
-Well, this is a breath
of sweet air.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.904
You, worried about your boy

13:56.904 --> 13:59.873
after throwin' shame
and abusin' him his whole life.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.208
-All right. I'm changed.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.910
-He don't know that.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.245
Maybe he was on his way up,
heard you come back livin',

14:05.245 --> 14:07.014
and turned on his heel
and left us for good.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.015
I wouldn't blame him.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.349
-I'm puttin' a party together.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.952
I'm settin' off to find him,
and that's that!

14:15.055 --> 14:16.957
With your kind permission.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.892
-Which I do not grant!

14:18.892 --> 14:21.028
I need you to help
with a serious matter

14:21.028 --> 14:22.629
that concerns all the clans.

14:22.629 --> 14:23.696
Hezzy Shay tells me

14:23.696 --> 14:27.334
that our smokehouse
is dangerously low on meat.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.602
The autumn hunt,
it has to happen tomorrow.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.204
-There are
three weeks to autumn.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.406
-Now, I realize that.
Vicious winter's comin'.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.508
We can't be caught
without provisions.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.644
Now you're our best hunter,

14:37.644 --> 14:40.513
so I would like you to
lead the clan in the hunt...

14:40.513 --> 14:41.915
if you feel strong enough.

14:41.915 --> 14:44.184
-Yes, I'm healed sufficient.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.420
I'll start to make preparations.

14:51.358 --> 14:54.661
DOCTOR: Look over
to your right. Yeah.

14:54.661 --> 14:57.164
Look over to your left.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.398
Good!

14:58.398 --> 14:59.699
What's your name?

14:59.699 --> 15:02.435
-Foster Farrell VIII.
That's my name.

15:02.435 --> 15:03.703
-Hmmm. That's, you know,
that's a lot of name,

15:03.703 --> 15:06.439
but you're a big man
so it suits you.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.508
Who's the President
of the United States?

15:08.508 --> 15:10.543
-I don't know that.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.345
-Well, you know, it's probably
best that you don't know.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.714
It'll keep your
blood pressure down.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.183
But it doesn't look like

15:16.183 --> 15:18.318
there's been
any permanent damage done.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.353
The next time you want to bang
your head against something,

15:20.353 --> 15:21.955
try using your pillow.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.425
All right.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.260
While you're here,

15:27.260 --> 15:30.230
I'm gonna give you
some basic survival advice.

15:30.230 --> 15:34.367
Keep your head down and
be very careful who you trust.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.069
-And why should I trust you?

15:36.069 --> 15:38.238
-(chuckles) That's very good.
You learn fast.

15:38.238 --> 15:41.741
Finally now, this one is
the most important thing, okay?

15:41.741 --> 15:45.145
Never forget your reason
to keep on living.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.679
It can be a person or a place.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.982
Just write it down,
keep it close to you

15:48.982 --> 15:50.417
and look at it
whenever you need.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.320
-I can't write.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.190
-No, but that--that's okay.

15:57.190 --> 16:00.227
It's all right.
I'll give you a pad and a paper.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.628
You can draw it.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.563
Take this.
I'll clear it with the guards.

16:03.563 --> 16:06.766
Draw the thing that's going to
keep you alive, because, son,

16:06.766 --> 16:08.135
you're going to need it.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.242
WADE: Hey, Jenny...
Fill that up.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.610
-Ain't you got coffee
at headquarters, Wade?

16:17.610 --> 16:19.379
Battery acid is more like it.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.647
Coffee's on me, Jenny.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.415
-It's okay, Henry, I got it.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.451
-Your money's no good here,
Sheriff.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.619
Let me get in on the good side
of the law.

16:26.619 --> 16:29.056
Might kill my wife
any day now.

16:29.056 --> 16:31.424
Gonna need you
to turn a blind eye.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.026
-Yeah, well, thanks.

16:34.261 --> 16:35.562
How is Dorothy?

16:35.562 --> 16:36.763
-How are you?

16:36.763 --> 16:40.300
Heard you took
a helluva tumble.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.102
-No, not really.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.637
-Well, that cast there
looks pretty serious.

16:44.637 --> 16:45.705
-It's just sprained.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.674
Thank you.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.209
Okay, Hank.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.510
Don't you go killin'
your wife, okay?

16:50.510 --> 16:53.213
She's the only one
who gonna put up with you.

16:53.213 --> 16:56.783
HANK: Nice write-up here
in the Lexington Gazette.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.351
-What's that?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.253
-About you arrestin'
that Farrell shit

17:00.253 --> 17:02.122
that murdered Breece Dobbs.

17:03.490 --> 17:04.624
(slams down paper)

17:04.624 --> 17:05.725
-What the hell is this?

17:05.725 --> 17:07.094
-I'm quoted in this article.

17:07.094 --> 17:10.063
I never gave a damn quote.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.664
-"We're very pleased
to have solved a crime

17:11.664 --> 17:14.201
"that has impacted not only
the town of Blackburg,

17:14.201 --> 17:17.270
but my family and I,
on a profoundly personal level."

17:17.270 --> 17:18.471
Sounds like
somethin' you'd say.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.407
-It's horse shit!

17:20.407 --> 17:21.841
-Well, I don't know what
you want me to tell you, Wade.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.276
Go to the Gazette
and retract it.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.078
It might raise a few eyebrows
but whatever.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.346
-There's a man in county
right now.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.381
I helped put him in there.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.750
That's weighin' on me
pretty damned heavy right now.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.553
-All right, Wade.
Wade. Stop, stop.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.388
You're making this
so complicated.

17:35.388 --> 17:39.726
It's--it's super simple.
You just have to believe it.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.361
We got the guy.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.429
-What are you talkin' about?

17:42.429 --> 17:43.330
-We got the guy.
-No! No!

17:43.330 --> 17:45.798
-Yes, yes!
-No! We got a guy.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.500
Listen to me, I sorely
want to catch the person

17:47.500 --> 17:48.335
that killed my brother-in-law,

17:48.335 --> 17:49.436
but call me
a stickler for detail,

17:49.436 --> 17:52.305
I'd like it to be the person
who actually killed him.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.773
-We got him!
That's the guy right here.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.408
He's guilty.
-It's not one of those things

17:55.408 --> 17:56.776
where you repeat a lie
a hundred times over

17:56.776 --> 17:57.844
and it turns into the truth!

17:57.844 --> 17:59.879
-Any other sheriff
in any other town in the world

17:59.879 --> 18:01.514
would be thrilled to make
an arrest like this

18:01.514 --> 18:02.649
and get this thing buttoned up.

18:02.649 --> 18:05.218
-You are not listening!
-So, you listen to me. Hold on.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.620
You need to claim this, Wade.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.289
All right?
Claim it as your own.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.557
You need to tell everybody

18:10.557 --> 18:12.259
a hundred miles
in every direction,

18:12.259 --> 18:16.229
"Look what I did; I got him."

18:16.229 --> 18:19.466
Because after your recent...
accident,

18:19.466 --> 18:21.568
you want to put
all that talk in town to rest?

18:21.568 --> 18:22.769
You need a win.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.339
You hear?

18:47.194 --> 18:48.361
Damn it.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.941
-I just thought that since
she's carryin' a Farrell child,

19:01.941 --> 19:04.477
maybe...
maybe she could stay.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.514
-Never before has an outsider
been allowed to live among us.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.182
HASIL:
Never as far as I know,

19:09.182 --> 19:12.252
but, (sighs), I mean,
we got the Kenna here now.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.953
-The Kenna
are of this mountain.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.489
The clans look at folks
one way--

19:16.489 --> 19:18.658
either you're kin
or you're not--

19:18.658 --> 19:20.860
and your girl ain't kin.

19:20.860 --> 19:25.232
I'm sorry, Hasil, but right now,
I can't allow her up here.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.399
-Maybe one day?

19:28.268 --> 19:29.436
-I make no promises.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.507
-I just,
I don't know what to do.

19:34.507 --> 19:38.245
-Hasil, you can't keep lookin'
at me to solve your problems.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.946
Now if you're man enough
to create a life,

19:39.946 --> 19:41.814
you are man enough
to make a decision.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.520
Just remember,
your family's up here.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.924
-You gave me
a lot of responsibility.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.529
Wouldn't feel right
walkin' away from it.

19:58.465 --> 20:01.268
-So, you come
to a decision then?

20:01.268 --> 20:02.969
-I suppose I have.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.637
-She can stay here tonight.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.939
I'll excuse you from the hunt.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.074
But first thing tomorrow,

20:08.074 --> 20:10.443
you take her back down
and you tell her your choice.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.354
-Don't get all worked up.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.590
Don't go soundin' no alarm.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.425
We'll be in and out
(snaps fingers)

20:25.425 --> 20:27.327
in jackrabbit time.

20:27.327 --> 20:30.330
-Just goin' to grab us some
libations and be on our way.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.799
Here's a little somethin'
from us to you.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.467
With our thanks.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.836
-Ah, come to papa,
little darlin'.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.938
It's been too long.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.707
-You fellas really
don't wanna be here.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.309
-Hey!

20:42.309 --> 20:45.312
Put 'em down,
nice and careful.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.816
Then get the hell out.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.651
Don't never come back,
you Farrells.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.593
-Uh, okay, okay.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.495
Okay, and listen up, you all.
Listen up.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.564
Look, I--
I hear what you're sayin'

21:04.564 --> 21:06.399
and I understand your concerns.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.634
Could something go wrong?

21:07.634 --> 21:08.768
Could somebody get hurt?

21:08.768 --> 21:10.069
Of course.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.771
Anything can happen,

21:11.771 --> 21:14.006
but we can meet here every week,

21:14.006 --> 21:16.343
and we can talk
and get angry and--

21:16.343 --> 21:20.647
and print flyers up,
and nothin' is gonna change.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.649
We have to take action.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.484
We have to take this
to next level,

21:24.484 --> 21:27.754
and the next level
is public protest.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.556
Anybody here
who's uncomfortable with

21:29.556 --> 21:33.593
what we're gonna do tomorrow,
you just get up and go.

21:33.593 --> 21:34.561
No judgment.

21:36.696 --> 21:38.831
All right?

21:38.831 --> 21:41.834
We'll still consider you all
a part of the group.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.470
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

21:43.470 --> 21:46.038
-And we'll still consider you
there in spirit.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.907
Okay, everybody,
we've got work to do.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.442
I'm gonna talk through
tomorrow again

21:49.442 --> 21:50.743
so that everybody understands

21:50.743 --> 21:52.612
exactly what's gonna happen,
all right?

21:52.612 --> 21:54.681
I don't want there to be
any confusion.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.549
Confusion will get us
into trouble.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.819
-You know, we got tall concerns

21:59.819 --> 22:02.054
about how we're gonna manage
the yields of years past

22:02.054 --> 22:04.991
when we're cut off from land
on the other side of that fence.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.393
-Well, how 'bout
you worry about the hunt

22:06.393 --> 22:07.960
when it's done with,

22:07.960 --> 22:10.830
and you limp outta the woods
empty-handed.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.599
Same as last year.

22:12.599 --> 22:13.666
-I never did.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.368
-Well, then let's win this one.

22:15.368 --> 22:17.003
(chuckles)

22:17.003 --> 22:18.371
-Company.

22:21.408 --> 22:22.909
-These are the weapons
you surrendered to your Bren'in

22:22.909 --> 22:24.611
the other night?
-Yeah, some of them.

22:26.145 --> 22:28.515
-She know they're
once more in your house?

22:28.515 --> 22:30.683
-Well, I hope so.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.385
'Cause she put them there.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.621
-I'll not lie, I'm surprised.

22:34.621 --> 22:37.424
-Well, you can be surprised
elsewhere.

22:37.424 --> 22:39.526
We got us a hunt
to prepare for.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.027
-You're gonna hunt with these?

22:41.027 --> 22:43.796
Must be very poor huntsmen
indeed.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.998
-Excuse me?

22:45.998 --> 22:48.535
-Why else would you require
such an unfair advantage

22:48.535 --> 22:49.902
over your prey?

22:49.902 --> 22:53.072
-Look, lady, we got
a near-empty smokehouse,

22:53.072 --> 22:54.441
and I aim to fill it up.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.878
Now we will be trappin'...

22:58.878 --> 23:00.447
usin' spears...

23:00.447 --> 23:03.783
bow and arrow, but guns,
they get the job done,

23:03.783 --> 23:05.852
quick and certain.

23:05.852 --> 23:08.721
-So, you rely on the vicious
weapon of the world below

23:08.721 --> 23:09.956
instead of your
huntin' skills...

23:09.956 --> 23:11.190
-All right,
all right, all right!

23:11.190 --> 23:13.025
You don't like guns.

23:13.025 --> 23:17.163
-I did not say that.
Guns have their place.

23:17.163 --> 23:18.130
And their use.

23:19.966 --> 23:22.134
But to kill a creature
whose flesh will sustain

23:22.134 --> 23:25.472
from a cowardly distance,
where's the honor in that?

23:25.472 --> 23:27.106
-And where is the honor
in starvin' to death?

23:27.106 --> 23:28.575
-That meat will be tainted!

23:28.575 --> 23:30.510
-Then... don't... eat it.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.849
-The Kenna
will join your hunt.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.921
I think you'll find
we're excellent hunters.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.523
-Oh! Oh, oh!

23:43.523 --> 23:45.625
I'm sure you are.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.794
Since you showed up here
all skinny and pale,

23:47.794 --> 23:49.128
hat in hand.

23:49.128 --> 23:50.863
Now why don't you
get outta the way

23:50.863 --> 23:52.999
and let us do the huntin'

23:52.999 --> 23:55.735
'cause you don't know the land
where we find the best game.

23:57.003 --> 23:59.739
-We don't find it, sir.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.207
We allow it to find us.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.808
-Mother Mountain...

24:35.808 --> 24:40.212
lead the most considerable
of your creatures to us

24:40.212 --> 24:44.984
so that we may be sustained
during the long winter to come.

24:50.222 --> 24:54.594
And let tomorrow's hunt
be remembered for years to come

24:54.594 --> 24:58.565
as one of the most bountiful
in the history of all the clans.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.968
(singing in native language)

25:10.276 --> 25:13.079
And now... we celebrate!

25:13.079 --> 25:15.247
(crowd cheering)

25:15.247 --> 25:18.184
(lively music)

25:27.627 --> 25:29.729
-You can go if you want.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.297
-I ain't gonna leave you.

25:34.266 --> 25:37.069
Plus it's better this way.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.204
Just the two of us.

25:42.074 --> 25:44.711
-Three of us.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.312
-(Hasil sighs)

25:48.347 --> 25:51.918
I just want you to know
that whatever happens...

25:51.918 --> 25:54.286
-You make me nervous
when you say "whatever happens."

25:57.056 --> 25:58.024
What do you mean?

26:03.630 --> 26:05.197
-Future, I guess.

26:10.970 --> 26:14.073
(crowd cheering and shouting)

26:14.073 --> 26:16.575
(lively music playing)

26:30.657 --> 26:33.960
-Not as much fun
when you wear the crown, is it?

26:37.263 --> 26:39.265
-I've had my share of fun.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.633
More would only be more.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.236
-One dance?

26:44.236 --> 26:45.905
With your rotten ol' husband?

26:51.177 --> 26:53.312
-Maybe at the celebration
next autumn.

26:53.312 --> 26:56.382
(crowd cheering and shouting)

27:11.097 --> 27:12.965
-You sure you wanna leave now?

27:12.965 --> 27:14.200
You can go join the hunt.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.735
We got our whole lives
ahead of us,

27:15.735 --> 27:17.436
so another day won't hurt.

27:17.436 --> 27:19.305
-It's best we leave now.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.273
Ain't no need for
a bunch of long good-byes.

27:23.175 --> 27:25.812
-You're nervous.
I can tell.

27:28.915 --> 27:30.082
-We should go.

28:10.156 --> 28:13.125
(roar of ATVs)

28:18.765 --> 28:21.734
(boar oinking)

28:26.739 --> 28:28.074
(gunshots)

28:28.074 --> 28:29.341
(shouting and cheering)

28:40.787 --> 28:43.089
(imitating animal calls)

28:46.893 --> 28:48.895
(answering animal call
in distance)

29:22.061 --> 29:23.495
(empty gun clicks)

29:28.267 --> 29:30.136
(muttering quietly):
Piece of crap...

29:59.565 --> 30:02.468
(turkey gobbles)

30:07.306 --> 30:08.507
-(whispers)
I'll get the big one.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.409
-You get the little one.
-Okay, I got it.

30:15.514 --> 30:18.184
One...

30:18.184 --> 30:19.518
Two...

30:19.518 --> 30:20.619
Three.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.188
(gunshots)

30:24.190 --> 30:25.157
-Yeah!

30:29.595 --> 30:30.562
(animal calls)

30:52.919 --> 30:55.421
(distant animal calls)

31:16.275 --> 31:18.010
(animal yelps)

31:38.497 --> 31:40.933
(panting quietly)

31:53.479 --> 31:55.314
-(chanting)
Coal kills the Earth.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.249
Coal kills the sky.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.085
Coal gets the money.

31:59.085 --> 32:00.719
We get to die!

32:00.719 --> 32:02.521
Coal kills the Earth.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.456
-I'm here for a job,
you stupid bitches!

32:04.456 --> 32:06.658
I don't work,
my family don't eat!

32:06.658 --> 32:08.394
-We get to die!

32:08.394 --> 32:10.229
Coal kills the Earth.

32:10.229 --> 32:12.064
Coal kills the sky.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.532
Coal gets the money.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.401
We get to die!

32:15.401 --> 32:17.303
Coal kills the Earth.
-This is the thanks I get.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.038
I help your sister, and
this is the thanks that I get.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.106
-Yes, I understand.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.240
-She's got insurance
because of me,

32:21.240 --> 32:22.374
and this is how she shows
her goddamn appreciation?

32:22.374 --> 32:24.410
-She doesn't know that, okay,
so let me talk to her.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.312
I'll take care of it.
-I want them out of here now!

32:26.312 --> 32:29.615
-If you'll let me speak to 'em,
I'll take care of it!

32:29.615 --> 32:31.183
-Coal kills the Earth.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.652
-Hey, folks. Listen.
Private property.

32:33.652 --> 32:35.187
-It's a peaceful protest,
Wade...

32:35.187 --> 32:37.356
-We get to die!
-Yeah. Look, I understand that.

32:37.356 --> 32:38.590
You're welcome to protest.

32:38.590 --> 32:39.725
You just do it over here,

32:39.725 --> 32:41.327
out by the side of the road

32:41.327 --> 32:42.428
or on the other side
of the road.

32:42.428 --> 32:43.562
That's perfectly fine.

32:43.562 --> 32:44.663
-We're not leaving.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.332
-Coal kills the Earth.
-Ow!

32:46.332 --> 32:47.166
-You're makin' me look
pretty bad, okay?

32:47.166 --> 32:48.634
-I don't care
what it looks like.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.236
I care what they're doing
to our community.

32:50.236 --> 32:51.403
-Come on!

32:51.403 --> 32:53.239
-Oh. You're takin' her side
over ours?

32:53.239 --> 32:54.506
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

32:54.506 --> 32:55.974
-She's the one
that got you the insurance!

32:57.409 --> 32:58.477
She's the one
takin' care of you,

32:58.477 --> 32:59.778
so come on, let's go!

32:59.778 --> 33:01.580
-You think that makes it
all square and right, huh?

33:01.580 --> 33:03.082
You killed my husband!

33:03.082 --> 33:04.750
-Jesus Christ, Ledda!
-You're killin' our town.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.552
-Hey, listen to me.
Do you want me to arrest you?

33:06.552 --> 33:08.054
-Yeah!
Yeah, you wanna arrest me?

33:08.054 --> 33:09.055
Go ahead.
You want me outta here,

33:09.055 --> 33:10.256
you're gonna have to.

33:10.256 --> 33:12.558
Yeah, go ahead.
Yeah? You see this?

33:12.558 --> 33:13.759
Go ahead.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.394
Yeah!
-(crowd booing)

33:15.394 --> 33:17.296
-That's right!
Keep up the good work!

33:17.296 --> 33:19.131
-Ledda, come on!

33:19.131 --> 33:21.267
(crowd booing)

33:21.267 --> 33:22.634
-God, you are such a dick!

33:22.634 --> 33:24.136
-Hey!
-You're such a--

33:24.136 --> 33:25.671
-Get in the car and stop that!

33:25.671 --> 33:27.239
I don't wanna hear you
talkin' to me at all!

33:27.239 --> 33:28.374
Can you stop that, please?

33:28.374 --> 33:30.442
Jesus Christ!

33:30.442 --> 33:32.078
Can you stop filmin', please?

33:32.078 --> 33:33.712
-Coal kills the Earth.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.114
I'll have some
deputies come down

33:35.114 --> 33:36.815
and take care of them, okay?

33:36.815 --> 33:38.217
-We get to die!

33:38.217 --> 33:39.351
LEDDA:
I hope you're happy.

33:39.351 --> 33:40.619
-I hope you're happy.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.621
-Yeah?
Good job of that yourself.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.690
You don't need my help.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.725
-Shut up! I told you
to shut up the whole way.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.361
-Yeah, well, you shut up!

33:49.361 --> 33:52.431
(crowd cheering)
-Yeah!

33:52.431 --> 33:54.166
-Well, even cut off
from the land below,

33:54.166 --> 33:55.767
I think we did fine work.

33:55.767 --> 33:58.837
-Last year's hunt was
more plentiful, memory serve,

33:58.837 --> 34:01.607
but if we're careful,
cut our portions,

34:01.607 --> 34:03.742
should be able to make
the winter fine.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.378
-You think so?
-Yeah, oh yeah.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.080
-Ooowee!
-All right!

34:08.080 --> 34:09.548
-How you doin', Foster?

34:09.548 --> 34:11.350
-Hey, year after year,

34:11.350 --> 34:14.286
you always capture
the biggest prize.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.322
Don't see why
the rest of us even try!

34:16.322 --> 34:19.258
-Well, I've been at it
longer than you, boy.

34:19.258 --> 34:20.626
Take your purpose
a little more serious.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.461
Maybe next time
you can bring in somethin'

34:22.461 --> 34:23.662
bigger than a chipmunk.

34:23.662 --> 34:26.598
-(laughter)

34:26.598 --> 34:28.734
-My Bren'in pleased?

34:28.734 --> 34:32.804
-Well, I think you proved
that you're our best hunter.

34:32.804 --> 34:33.805
-I did.

34:33.805 --> 34:37.276
(crowd chattering)

34:41.447 --> 34:43.249
-Maybe I spoke too soon.

34:46.752 --> 34:48.454
-Don't feel bad, Foster.

34:48.454 --> 34:51.190
Next year you take your purpose
a little more serious,

34:51.190 --> 34:52.691
you could be top hunter again.

34:56.395 --> 34:57.663
-Fine work.

34:57.663 --> 35:00.499
-Let's get all this meat
to Hezzy's smokehouse.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.392
-(pounding on door)

36:00.392 --> 36:01.960
(scream)
Let me out!

36:01.960 --> 36:05.231
Somebody help me!

36:05.231 --> 36:07.533
Let me out!

36:14.806 --> 36:17.309
(man screaming)

36:17.309 --> 36:18.944
-(screaming)
-Get back!

36:18.944 --> 36:22.481
Come on, get back!
Come on, get back, get back!

36:22.481 --> 36:23.949
BIG FOSTER:
(yelling) Where's Hezzy?

36:23.949 --> 36:25.217
Where's Hezzy?

36:25.217 --> 36:26.117
-He's in there.

36:26.117 --> 36:27.686
-Croaked... croaked,
maybe, sad to say.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.388
-The smokehouse
is his whole life.

36:29.388 --> 36:31.257
There's no way
he'd leave if it fell to peril.

36:31.257 --> 36:33.925
I think he got burned up, 'long
with everything else inside.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.561
-Everything?

36:35.561 --> 36:36.895
-All gone to charcoal now.

36:36.895 --> 36:38.964
-I wonder who had a hand
in that, Big Foster.

36:38.964 --> 36:40.932
-You're like a beetle
up my backside, ain't you?

36:40.932 --> 36:43.669
-You see, this is what comes
for allowin' the devil back in

36:43.669 --> 36:45.537
and straightaway puttin' him
in charge of the hunt!

36:45.537 --> 36:46.972
-If you got somethin' to say,
Shurn, just say it.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.474
-Kenna women out-hunted him!

36:48.474 --> 36:49.841
Made him look like a fool,

36:49.841 --> 36:52.278
so he burned up
all the game outta spite!

36:52.278 --> 36:54.480
-Better you watch
your crooked tongue!

36:54.480 --> 36:56.648
-Perhaps the woman is right.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.517
I've heard stories
of your past cruelties.

36:58.517 --> 36:59.751
Hot-headedness
can lead a man

36:59.751 --> 37:00.886
to do all manner
of destructive things.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.621
-(yelling) Yeah, well,
you ain't one of us, all right?

37:02.621 --> 37:03.855
You got no right
speakin' on our matters!

37:03.855 --> 37:05.757
-And you've got no right
to destroy the bounty

37:05.757 --> 37:07.726
that the Kenna delivered
to your Bren'in.

37:07.726 --> 37:08.794
-(yelling) Okay, enough!

37:08.794 --> 37:11.563
Ill talk and accusations
won't bring back our loss!

37:11.563 --> 37:13.499
No.
Our only concern should be

37:13.499 --> 37:14.900
replacin' the meat
lost in the flame

37:14.900 --> 37:17.269
and finding
poor Hezzy's remains.

37:17.269 --> 37:19.605
-All right. Well,
I'm takin' some men on a run.

37:19.605 --> 37:21.373
We got less land to hunt.

37:21.373 --> 37:23.642
The land we got,
we just hunted clean.

37:23.642 --> 37:26.545
The run will fill up
our larders quick and easy.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.046
-It won't work!

37:28.046 --> 37:29.047
-What are you sayin'?

37:29.047 --> 37:31.317
-A run, it won't work.

37:31.317 --> 37:32.751
Me and Barnabas,
we went down to town

37:32.751 --> 37:34.286
to try and grab us some beer...

37:34.286 --> 37:35.887
-You what?
-We truly sorry, Bren'in.

37:35.887 --> 37:38.857
We know we done wrong,
and you'd be right to punish us,

37:38.857 --> 37:42.461
but they got guards
carryin' fire at every store.

37:42.461 --> 37:43.695
Ain't no way
we could manage a run

37:43.695 --> 37:45.731
without blood bein' spilt.

37:45.731 --> 37:48.634
-Okay. There will be no runs!

37:48.634 --> 37:50.436
A second hunt
is our only answer.

37:50.436 --> 37:51.837
-Not to worry, Bren'in.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.440
Kenna can always find
fresh meat.

37:56.775 --> 37:59.277
(quiet chatter)

38:02.448 --> 38:05.417
(scratching and scrubbing)

38:31.610 --> 38:33.879
*

38:41.119 --> 38:42.220
(chanting on video)
Coal gets the money.

38:42.220 --> 38:44.756
LEDDA (on video):
Keep up the good work!

38:44.756 --> 38:46.558
-Coal kills the Earth.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.727
Coal kills the sky.

38:48.727 --> 38:51.497
-WADE: Hey!
-LEDDA: You're such a dick!

38:51.497 --> 38:53.131
Ledda, Jesus Christ--

38:53.131 --> 38:54.866
Could you stop filming, please?

38:54.866 --> 38:57.369
(protest chant continues)

39:01.673 --> 39:04.109
-I'm goin' up.
I'll check on Caleb.

39:04.109 --> 39:05.577
-Uh-hm.

39:06.745 --> 39:08.079
(sighs)

39:10.516 --> 39:13.051
-I wanted to tell you
about the protest beforehand,

39:13.051 --> 39:15.887
but I knew that
you would try and stop me.

39:15.887 --> 39:19.558
I figured if something went
wrong, you'd be protected

39:19.558 --> 39:21.760
if you didn't know
anything in advance.

39:21.760 --> 39:22.961
-You put me
in a pretty bad position.

39:22.961 --> 39:24.596
-Yeah, I know.

39:24.596 --> 39:25.864
-I already got half the town

39:25.864 --> 39:27.666
lookin' at me
like I'm a goddamn fool.

39:27.666 --> 39:30.101
I don't need you workin'
to convince the other half.

39:30.101 --> 39:32.904
-Well, I'm sorry.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.940
-Just...

39:34.940 --> 39:36.642
think about other people
every once in a while.

39:38.444 --> 39:39.811
-(sighs)

39:39.811 --> 39:42.180
Let's not fight, Wade.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.683
I don't want there
to be bad feelings.

39:44.683 --> 39:45.984
We don't have time.

39:58.129 --> 40:00.932
(footsteps moving away)

40:21.987 --> 40:25.457
(distant train horn)

40:33.665 --> 40:35.433
-What are you doing?
Come on!

40:40.806 --> 40:42.674
-There's somethin'
that I gotta, uh...

40:42.674 --> 40:43.642
(clears throat)

40:48.580 --> 40:51.149
This is gonna be tough.

40:51.149 --> 40:54.886
-I know, but it'll get easier.

40:56.588 --> 40:57.756
I promise.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.518
Okay.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.068
-(knock on door)

41:46.772 --> 41:48.173
-Oh, hell!

41:48.173 --> 41:49.708
You lay one goddamn hand
on me,

41:49.708 --> 41:51.009
I'll scream like a girl.

41:52.711 --> 41:53.912
-Butch, I need your help.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.717
-You know,
beggars can't be choosers,

41:58.717 --> 42:01.853
but I spent the last year
and a half outta work,

42:01.853 --> 42:03.689
prayin' for a job,
but this sucks.

42:03.689 --> 42:06.191
Nothin' to do but look
at the trees all day long.

42:06.191 --> 42:07.693
-Man, tell me about it!

42:07.693 --> 42:09.194
I'm goin' outta my mind.

42:09.194 --> 42:10.796
I ain't seen one damn Farrell.

42:10.796 --> 42:12.964
Just a bunch of
birds and squirrels.

42:12.964 --> 42:15.567
-And I hate it.
-Now hold up.

42:15.567 --> 42:17.869
What the hell...?

42:17.869 --> 42:18.837
Is this for real?

42:22.173 --> 42:24.710
-Uh, hold up right there.

42:24.710 --> 42:27.112
I'm gonna have to--
to stop ya.

42:27.112 --> 42:28.947
-Excuse me, ladies.

42:28.947 --> 42:30.115
(chuckles)

42:31.216 --> 42:32.951
-Hello. I'm Mack.

42:32.951 --> 42:34.019
This is Luke.

42:35.854 --> 42:37.222
You don't talk much, do ya?

42:53.839 --> 42:56.274
(moaning)

43:00.879 --> 43:02.280
-(breathless) Harder.

43:02.280 --> 43:04.015
Sexy.

43:04.015 --> 43:06.017
(groans)

43:09.387 --> 43:11.957
Hey, what you doin'?

43:11.957 --> 43:12.958
(screams)

43:18.196 --> 43:19.364
-Guess he's havin' fun.

43:37.282 --> 43:38.249
Oh, hey.

43:41.386 --> 43:43.021
(breathless) Hey.

43:45.256 --> 43:46.692
(screams)

43:46.692 --> 43:48.026
(shuddering gasps)
