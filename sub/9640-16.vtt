00:02.041 --> 00:04.929
- This is awesome!
- Is it, Max?

00:04.964 --> 00:07.337
Is this really what you
wanted for your birthday?

00:08.868 --> 00:12.434
If we live, I am so
taking my gift card back.

00:12.468 --> 00:16.716
Guys, paddle faster!

00:18.921 --> 00:20.827
We're not gonna make it.
We're burning up!

00:20.862 --> 00:24.978
I know. Before we see this volcano blow,
turn this lava into snow!

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.819 --> 00:40.425
So then it went from lava to snow.
How insane is that?

00:40.460 --> 00:42.332
So, after we got off
the ski slope...

00:42.367 --> 00:45.644
You went into the lodge and drank
hot chocolate with a polar bear.

00:45.678 --> 00:49.151
Did I already tell you this story? Oh,
my goodness, I'm turning into Grandma.

00:50.724 --> 00:53.697
No, I read that exact story
in the new H.J. Darling book,

00:53.732 --> 00:56.738
Charmed and Dangerous:
The Story of the Lost Wand.

00:56.772 --> 00:59.744
- Hm. I don't know those books.
- Everyone knows those books.

00:59.778 --> 01:02.715
How could you not know?
They're about wizards like you guys.

01:02.750 --> 01:06.186
Here's how... I don't read.

01:06.220 --> 01:09.426
Not even menus. She points
at the pictures. - Mm-hmm.

01:11.633 --> 01:14.738
Oh, Alex. That's so sad.
I could teach you.

01:14.773 --> 01:18.780
Like I taught you how to make a bird feeder
out of a pine cone, peanut butter and
raisins.

01:18.814 --> 01:21.549
Yeah, my dad ate that.

01:21.583 --> 01:24.320
I know how to read, Harper.
I just choose not to.

01:24.354 --> 01:27.459
You should read Charmed and Dangerous,
'cause a lot of stuff in the books

01:27.493 --> 01:28.662
seems to happen to you.

01:28.696 --> 01:31.868
Wait. Her stories are
things that happen to us?

01:31.903 --> 01:34.606
How's that possible? You're the
only person I tell them to.

01:34.641 --> 01:38.512
Oh, no. I told a few
stories to my lizard once.

01:38.546 --> 01:40.313
Then he ran away.

01:42.414 --> 01:45.483
Max, you're lizard
didn't run away... - Shh!

01:48.423 --> 01:50.058
He ran away.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.797
OK, hang on. Maybe this
is all a coincidence.

01:53.832 --> 01:57.501
Harper, how many Charmed and
Dangerous books are there? - Seven.

01:57.536 --> 01:59.404
Fine, go get them.
I'll read 'em by morning.

01:59.438 --> 02:02.575
I'll skip flossing to save up time.

02:02.610 --> 02:06.148
"Don't eat corn."

02:09.252 --> 02:10.752
* Well you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

02:10.786 --> 02:12.654
* And the end will no doubt,
justify the means *

02:12.689 --> 02:14.924
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

02:14.959 --> 02:16.760
* Yes please *

02:16.794 --> 02:18.764
* But you might find out
it'll go to your head *

02:18.798 --> 02:20.934
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

02:20.968 --> 02:23.238
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

02:23.272 --> 02:24.707
* That's what I said *

02:24.742 --> 02:28.246
* Everything is not what it seems *

02:28.280 --> 02:31.785
* When you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

02:31.819 --> 02:35.557
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

02:35.591 --> 02:39.494
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

02:39.528 --> 02:43.265
* Everything is not what it seems *

02:43.299 --> 02:47.570
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

02:47.605 --> 02:51.007
* Be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

02:51.042 --> 02:55.279
* Because everything is not... *

02:55.313 --> 02:57.316
* What it seems *

02:57.317 --> 03:02.317

03:02.555 --> 03:05.224
- Did she steal our stories?
- Wait.

03:06.494 --> 03:09.163
- Did she steal our stories?
- Wait.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.433
She stole our stories!

03:13.669 --> 03:15.036
I knew it.

03:15.071 --> 03:17.972
Our stories are making this
lady rich. - And famous.

03:18.007 --> 03:20.508
And famous! There's a
crazy ten-minute sale,

03:20.543 --> 03:23.345
the kids get stuck in a movie,
the brother turns invisible,

03:23.380 --> 03:25.615
and they pour orange
soda into a genie's lamp.

03:25.650 --> 03:29.954
All right, so we've got our evidence.
Angry mob, assemble!

03:29.988 --> 03:32.791
I figured I'd be the one to make
a living writing wizard stories

03:32.825 --> 03:34.426
based on our adventures.

03:34.460 --> 03:36.561
Except my character's
name would be Serge.

03:36.596 --> 03:40.132
He'd walk with a bejeweled
cane and wear an eye-patch.

03:41.335 --> 03:43.068
What, no British accent?

03:44.437 --> 03:47.305
Why, that's a smashing idea.
Thanks, love!

03:48.641 --> 03:50.008
Hot.

03:52.412 --> 03:56.015
Guys, how do you think she
knows all this stuff about us?

03:56.049 --> 04:00.987
I'll bet this place is bugged.
Everybody talk in code.

04:01.022 --> 04:02.622
Peanuts.

04:04.290 --> 04:08.190
- Nobody knows your code, Max.
- Then we're safe.

04:09.626 --> 04:11.560
We've got to find her
and tell her to stop.

04:11.594 --> 04:15.664
Oh! I know where she lives. An abandoned
Paint Your Dish warehouse in upstate New
York.

04:15.699 --> 04:19.601
Whoa. How do you know she lives in an
abandoned Paint Your Dish warehouse?

04:19.635 --> 04:23.070
I had my mom's private investigator
track her down. - How's the case going?

04:23.105 --> 04:26.240
Everything's fine. Turns out my
dad was just sleeping in the car.

04:28.142 --> 04:31.811
Quick! To the Inter-Wizard People-Porter!
Or, as Dad calls it, the I.P.P.

04:33.247 --> 04:35.314
I pee pee.

04:41.254 --> 04:42.620
What is that?

04:42.654 --> 04:45.856
The I.P.P.

04:45.890 --> 04:48.258
Cut it out, Justin.
My stomach hurts!

04:49.427 --> 04:51.461
This tube will take us
wherever we want to go.

04:51.495 --> 04:53.429
Here, mortal. Put this on.

04:54.664 --> 04:56.899
Thanks for the helmet,
but I can't go.

04:56.933 --> 04:59.201
I'm teaching scrapbooking
to at-risk youths.

04:59.235 --> 05:03.238
At risk of what?
Making a scrapbook? Come on.

05:03.272 --> 05:06.107
I can't. Call me when
you get back. Goodbye!

05:06.142 --> 05:09.177
Not goodbye-goodbye, 'cause I'll
see you when you get back. But...

05:09.211 --> 05:13.113
Goodbye for now. Oh, darn.
I ruined a perfectly good goodbye.

05:14.649 --> 05:16.316
I.P.P. on.

05:17.251 --> 05:18.885
On what?

05:21.556 --> 05:24.824
Peter's Pies... Paint Your
Dish Factory Outlet...

05:24.858 --> 05:27.425
Paint Your Dish Customer
Service... Here we go.

05:27.460 --> 05:30.994
Paint Your Dish Warehouse
comma Abandoned.

05:31.029 --> 05:33.629
This thing is so cool.

05:40.637 --> 05:43.940
Wait! Don't tell our dad. We're not
supposed to use it without permission.

05:43.974 --> 05:47.009
- Tick-a-lock.
- What does that mean?

05:47.043 --> 05:49.978
It means my lips are sealed.
I use it when people tell me a secret,

05:50.012 --> 05:52.680
or there's something I shouldn't
tell... - Tick-a-lock.

05:52.714 --> 05:54.848
Bend your knees, guys.
Bend your knees.

05:54.882 --> 05:57.350
Ow! My ankle.

05:57.385 --> 06:02.388
I'm OK. No, I'm not.

06:02.422 --> 06:04.490
Can we paint a plate
while we're here?

06:04.524 --> 06:07.325
- Max, I twisted my ankle.
- Will you two focus?

06:07.360 --> 06:10.063
We're on a mission to find H.
J. Darling.

06:10.097 --> 06:12.965
OK, Ricky. Good scrapbooking.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.568
Uh, nice use of vinegar to
make the paper look old.

06:15.603 --> 06:18.537
Stay off the streets. Good kid.

06:18.571 --> 06:20.905
Oh, I hope he makes it.

06:22.540 --> 06:27.875
Alex, Max, Justin... I mean,
who are you people?

06:27.909 --> 06:30.443
No, the question is, who are you?

06:30.478 --> 06:33.112
And if the answer is H.J.
Darling, then my new question

06:33.147 --> 06:35.314
is why are you
stealing our stories?

06:35.348 --> 06:39.119
That's an excellent new question.

06:39.153 --> 06:42.221
Um... Look. Why don't we
sit down and talk about it?

06:42.256 --> 06:46.592
Uh... I'll make snacks. - Do you
have sugar cubes drenched in honey?

06:46.626 --> 06:49.161
- "Boy salad?"
- That's what I call it.

06:49.196 --> 06:53.732
OK. Enough with the snacks.
What are you, a wizard?

06:53.766 --> 06:56.434
Or just someone who
likes to wear aquariums?

06:56.469 --> 06:59.169
Or, maybe that fish
on her head was a spy.

06:59.204 --> 07:02.005
I'll see if it knows the spy code.

07:04.475 --> 07:06.242
Peanuts.

07:07.910 --> 07:10.244
Nope. The fish isn't talking.

07:10.279 --> 07:13.480
You're in the middle of one
of your stories right now.

07:15.616 --> 07:16.750
My cornea!

07:18.486 --> 07:22.055
Bread, eggs, milk...

07:22.090 --> 07:24.491
This is the worst
story ever. - Oh...

07:24.525 --> 07:27.126
What is going on? Why are
you writing about our lives?

07:32.598 --> 07:34.366
This broke on it's own.

07:36.635 --> 07:39.737
Look, uh, sit down. I'm gonna make
some snickerdoodles with Red Hots,

07:39.771 --> 07:42.440
- and I'll explain everything.
- Hey...

07:42.474 --> 07:45.543
Harper makes snickerdoodles
with Red Hots.

07:45.577 --> 07:49.642
You're stealing more than just our stories.
You're stealing recipes!

07:49.676 --> 07:54.478
No, wait. Paint-a-plate, scrapbooking,
snickerdoodles with Red Hots...

07:54.513 --> 07:56.313
She's stealing Harper's life, too.

07:56.347 --> 07:59.148
I'm not stealing her life.
I have her life.

07:59.182 --> 08:02.984
I don't mean, like, I've taken it from her,
like she's gone, like it's separate...

08:03.018 --> 08:06.388
She still exists. What I'm
trying to say is... I am Harper.

08:06.422 --> 08:09.857
Oh, I've ruined a perfectly
good dramatic moment!

08:11.392 --> 08:14.160
Oh, my gosh, you are Harper.

08:14.195 --> 08:17.163
But we just left Harper, and you're
an adult. How is that possible?

08:17.197 --> 08:19.965
I'm Harper, from the future.

08:22.964 --> 08:25.264
So...

08:25.298 --> 08:28.601
If you are Harper,
from the future...

08:28.635 --> 08:31.370
How many fingers am I holding up?

08:31.404 --> 08:34.472
Two. - Oh, my gosh,
You are from the future!

08:35.607 --> 08:37.642
Um, OK. Nobody touch anything.

08:37.676 --> 08:39.677
If we do, we could
totally disrupt things

08:39.711 --> 08:41.845
for when we return to our own time.

08:41.880 --> 08:47.784
We're in our own time.
She came back from the future. - Right.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.452
I don't get it.

08:49.486 --> 08:53.222
Guys. She's definitely
Harper from the future.

08:55.392 --> 08:59.827
OK, so you are Harper from the future.
What are you doing here?

08:59.862 --> 09:02.128
Look, I really shouldn't
say a lot about the future,

09:02.163 --> 09:04.731
because it could change
the future. - See?

09:06.033 --> 09:09.502
I just wanted to be
right about something.

09:09.536 --> 09:13.405
Look, if you're from the future, why did
you come back here to write about us?

09:13.440 --> 09:17.374
In the future, everybody knows wizards
exist, so it's not that big a deal.

09:17.409 --> 09:21.210
It's more interesting for people to
read about wizards in this time period.

09:21.245 --> 09:23.312
How come people know about
wizards in the future?

09:23.346 --> 09:26.814
Again, I have to be careful
what I say about the future.

09:26.849 --> 09:29.750
But, wizards got exposed
because someone in this room

09:29.784 --> 09:32.318
has a big, big mouth.
I'm not gonna name names.

09:33.420 --> 09:34.654
Way to go.

09:34.688 --> 09:37.556
She said she wasn't naming names.

09:37.591 --> 09:40.759
But, I know it's me.

09:40.794 --> 09:44.129
Hold on. If you're mortal,
how can you travel back in time?

09:44.163 --> 09:48.531
I cannot stress enough the danger
we're in by even talking about this!

09:48.566 --> 09:50.333
But, I will admit that I had help

09:50.367 --> 09:52.935
from one of the most powerful
wizards of all time. - Me? Me?

09:52.970 --> 09:54.837
Is it me? Did I win
the competition?

09:54.871 --> 09:58.474
I have to put my foot down.
I've said too much already.

09:58.508 --> 10:01.743
As I used to say as a young woman,
tick-a-lock.

10:01.778 --> 10:05.046
OK, but please don't tell
young-Harper about future-Harper.

10:05.081 --> 10:07.682
It'll freak her out and make
her really self-conscious,

10:07.716 --> 10:09.517
and I've always
hated that about me.

10:09.551 --> 10:11.819
It's why I toned down my wardrobe.

10:13.321 --> 10:16.621
Really? 'Cause I've never
seen a hat you have to feed.

10:16.656 --> 10:18.789
Thanks!

10:20.725 --> 10:22.592
Hey, what's wrong
with your eye, weirdo?

10:22.626 --> 10:25.761
I scratched my cornea when I yanked
the paper out of the typewriter.

10:25.795 --> 10:29.664
Uh... I need an eye-flush station.

10:31.667 --> 10:34.802
Eye-flush after I.P.P.

10:39.273 --> 10:42.008
Alex, it's so great to
see you young again.

10:42.042 --> 10:46.078
Are you saying I get old in the future?
This just gets better and better.

10:46.112 --> 10:49.047
You're upset. Did Mason
break up with you already?

10:49.582 --> 10:53.117
Who's Mason? - Oop.
Tick-a-lock. Tick-a-lock.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.786
Do you know what I want to know?
Did I ever give you permission

10:55.820 --> 10:58.689
to use my stories to become
rich and famous? - Well, no.

10:58.723 --> 11:02.425
Then why'd you do it? - The secrets
you told me were so fascinating.

11:02.459 --> 11:05.026
They were secrets.
Secrets are secrets.

11:05.060 --> 11:07.894
That's why they call them secrets,
not books. - OK.

11:07.929 --> 11:12.263
That didn't make sense. - You're Harper.
You know what I'm saying.

11:12.297 --> 11:15.297
Do you want my permission
to use my stories? - Yes.

11:15.331 --> 11:18.332
Well, I'm not gonna give it to you.
I'm outta here. - But...

11:18.366 --> 11:20.700
Waverly Car Wash...

11:20.734 --> 11:23.202
Waverly Dry Cleaning...
Waverly... Oh, geez.

11:23.237 --> 11:25.569
- Alex, what are you doing?
- I am storming outta here.

11:25.604 --> 11:28.736
Waverly Pet Shop... Ha, here it is.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.037
Waverly Sub Station.

11:31.072 --> 11:32.738
Goodbye.

11:36.440 --> 11:37.840
Come on, Max. We better go, too.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.775
Justin, wait.
You've got to convince Alex

11:39.810 --> 11:41.844
to give Harper permission
to write those books

11:41.878 --> 11:44.711
or my friendship with Alex
will be ruined forever.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.646
I've always dreamed of this.
Someone has come from the future

11:47.680 --> 11:50.881
to give me an assignment
in the present day.

11:50.916 --> 11:52.515
I'm a Futurenaut.

11:54.151 --> 11:55.918
Hot.

12:03.724 --> 12:07.760
Alex, I called you ten times last night.
How'd it go with H.J. Darling?

12:07.794 --> 12:09.728
Oh, I think you know how it went.

12:09.762 --> 12:11.362
Or, maybe you don't, but you will.

12:11.396 --> 12:13.329
Then you'll know why I
didn't call you back.

12:13.363 --> 12:15.863
- You're upset with me?
- Oh, so you do know.

12:15.897 --> 12:19.001
No. What did I do? - I can't tell you,
but it's not what you did do.

12:19.036 --> 12:22.137
It's what you will do.
Whatever you think I'm gonna do,

12:22.171 --> 12:25.473
I guess I'm sorry for it. - No, I don't
think you are, or you wouldn't do it.

12:25.507 --> 12:29.876
Ha. - What's up?
Look at the two best friends

12:29.910 --> 12:33.379
having a loud conversation.

12:33.414 --> 12:35.914
What I love about you two is
you would never let anything

12:35.949 --> 12:37.715
get in the way of your friendship.

12:37.750 --> 12:41.185
You know what? If you're gonna be mad at
me and not tell me why you're mad at me,

12:41.219 --> 12:43.953
then I'm gonna be mad at you and
not tell you why I'm mad at you.

12:43.987 --> 12:47.156
Oh, shoot. I just told you why.
Now I'm mad at both of us!

12:49.625 --> 12:51.893
Aren't you gonna
go after her? - No.

12:53.295 --> 12:55.329
What is up with your sunglasses?

12:55.363 --> 12:57.662
It's filtered light therapy
for my injured eye.

12:57.697 --> 13:01.732
It's a pair of Mom's sunglasses
with a lens knocked out.

13:01.766 --> 13:03.767
Don't tell her.

13:03.802 --> 13:06.136
Look....

13:06.170 --> 13:07.537
You have to go after Harper.

13:07.571 --> 13:10.806
It's my mission from the future.
I'm a Futurenaut.

13:10.841 --> 13:13.675
Futurenaut? You just
made that word up.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.343
How do you know? You don't read.

13:15.377 --> 13:18.278
That's because I have all the words I need.
Including these two...

13:18.312 --> 13:19.645
- Good. Bye.
- No!

13:19.679 --> 13:25.050
Look, my mission, should I
choose to accept it, and I do...

13:25.085 --> 13:28.221
is to get you to give permission
to Harper to write those books.

13:28.255 --> 13:31.890
You can't give permission to someone
you can't trust, and I can't trust her

13:31.925 --> 13:35.260
because she went ahead and wrote
the books without my permission.

13:35.294 --> 13:37.494
Look, I've read the books
and they're really good.

13:37.528 --> 13:39.129
They're not just
about us as wizards.

13:39.163 --> 13:41.063
They're about your
friendship with Harper.

13:41.097 --> 13:43.932
Well, I don't care about our friendship.
I told her secrets.

13:43.966 --> 13:46.134
She betrayed me,
so our friendship's over.

13:46.168 --> 13:48.335
All right. But you're
missing out on the part

13:48.369 --> 13:50.703
where you and Harper are
getting chased by a dinosaur,

13:50.738 --> 13:55.573
and then Harper uses her knitting skills
to repair a rope bridge, and you get away.

13:57.242 --> 14:02.077
Ooh. An adventure
about knitting. Pass.

14:02.112 --> 14:04.780
Fine. Don't read any of the
stories about the great times

14:04.814 --> 14:06.814
you and Harper have in the future.

14:10.618 --> 14:15.155
Alex Russo has a book.

14:15.189 --> 14:17.124
Oh, I can hear you!

14:33.606 --> 14:37.074
Oh, my gosh.
I've turned into Serge!

14:37.108 --> 14:42.143
Remember I said I was going to write
wizard stories based on our adventures?

14:42.177 --> 14:43.776
No.

14:45.811 --> 14:47.911
Well, I did. And I said
I was gonna be Serge

14:47.945 --> 14:50.578
and I was gonna wear an eye-patch
and carry a bejeweled cane.

14:50.612 --> 14:53.046
And, look. I am!

14:54.015 --> 14:55.814
Well, Serge is a liar.

14:55.848 --> 14:59.783
He also said this book would have
dinosaurs and knitting, and it doesn't.

14:59.817 --> 15:04.219
So you gave the book a gander,
eh, gov'ner?

15:06.087 --> 15:09.588
Futurenaut? Gander? Why don't you
make that eye-patch a mouth-patch?

15:09.623 --> 15:14.359
In order to get you to read the book, I had
to lie to you about what was in the book.

15:14.394 --> 15:17.729
Well, fine. And you know what?
You were right. It is a good book.

15:17.763 --> 15:20.864
I didn't realize, now that Harper
knows the secret that I'm a wizard,

15:20.898 --> 15:23.499
there's all these adventures
we're gonna take together.

15:23.533 --> 15:25.534
Max and I are in that book,
too. - Yeah.

15:25.569 --> 15:27.804
I skipped to the parts
with my character, Julia.

15:27.839 --> 15:30.607
The rest was blah, blah, blah...

15:30.642 --> 15:33.210
So, you should give Harper
permission to write the books,

15:33.244 --> 15:35.346
so you two can stay
friends and I can say,

15:35.380 --> 15:38.081
Mission accomplished, chap.

15:38.116 --> 15:41.616
Serge has a catch phrase!
I gotta write that down.

15:41.651 --> 15:46.119
"Mission accomplished, chap."

15:46.154 --> 15:49.922
Really? Because I think Serge's
catch phrase is gonna be...

15:49.956 --> 15:52.357
" Stop hitting me
with me own cane."

15:52.391 --> 15:54.726
I don't want that on my...

15:59.464 --> 16:02.631
"I've done nothing wrong. And the way
you've treated me is unforgivable.

16:02.665 --> 16:05.633
"You're not the only person who
thinks we're not friends anymore.

16:05.667 --> 16:10.770
"There's another person and I think you
know who that person is. But if you don't...

16:10.804 --> 16:12.505
"it's me, Harper.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.774
"Signed, Harper."

16:16.009 --> 16:18.109
How does that sound?

16:18.143 --> 16:21.177
I liked the note you had
when you used the bad words.

16:21.212 --> 16:25.712
Bad words are a crutch.
They lead to tattoos and piercings.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.881
All right.

16:29.916 --> 16:31.616
Now let me ask you something.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.119
Can you tell this is glued?

16:35.153 --> 16:38.221
Oh, they're coming!

16:38.255 --> 16:40.856
I don't want to see Alex.
She's supposed to read the note!

16:40.890 --> 16:43.225
Ah! All my hard work, Harper!

16:43.259 --> 16:46.127
What's the quickest way
out of here? - The I.P.P.

16:49.931 --> 16:53.767
How do you work this thing?

16:53.801 --> 16:56.703
Just spin the dial
and stand under it.

16:57.805 --> 17:00.039
Oh, good job.

17:00.074 --> 17:02.408
Did I hear Harper in here?
I have to talk to her.

17:02.442 --> 17:04.276
Yeah. She left this note.

17:04.310 --> 17:07.978
I'm tired of reading.
Just tell me where she went.

17:08.012 --> 17:11.546
I don't know. Somewhere in the I.
P.P. - Dude!

17:11.580 --> 17:13.248
- Check the dial.
- Fine.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.550
I'll give it a gander.

17:15.585 --> 17:16.885
That is how you use the word.

17:19.690 --> 17:23.492
- She's going to the pyramids.
- Oh, great. I've never been to Vegas.

17:30.197 --> 17:32.629
Bend your knees, bend your knees! -

17:32.664 --> 17:34.797
Yes!

17:38.167 --> 17:40.502
Oh...

17:42.104 --> 17:43.572
Guys, where do you think Harper is?

17:43.606 --> 17:45.374
I don't know.

17:46.843 --> 17:48.109
Let's ask him.

17:48.144 --> 17:50.378
- Excuse me, sir.
- Oh...

17:50.412 --> 17:54.248
The eye-patch and bejeweled cane
tell me you're an adventurer.

17:54.283 --> 17:58.486
Thank you. Ah, someone who gets me.

17:58.520 --> 18:02.022
Have you seen a girl with long hair
and a shirt just like hers? Oh, wait!

18:02.057 --> 18:04.490
That's her.

18:04.524 --> 18:07.059
- Where did she go?
- Odd little girl.

18:07.093 --> 18:10.662
She said something about
pee-pee in the Grand Canyon.

18:12.632 --> 18:17.136
- I.P.P. in the Grand Canyon?
- You, too?

18:17.170 --> 18:20.905
Strange custom. Keep it up and
your natural wonder will be gone.

18:20.940 --> 18:23.974
All right. Come on, let's go.
Thanks, foreign dude.

18:24.008 --> 18:26.376
I'm from here.
You the foreign dude.

18:26.410 --> 18:28.779
Whatever.

18:31.382 --> 18:35.417
Harper! I give you permission!

18:35.451 --> 18:38.220
What? I can't hear you!

18:39.388 --> 18:42.992
I give you permission!

18:43.026 --> 18:46.396
A mission to do what?

18:46.431 --> 18:49.468
This is impossible!

18:49.502 --> 18:53.704
Mission Impossible?
I already saw it!

18:53.738 --> 18:57.441
- Meet me back at the house.
- OK.

18:57.476 --> 19:00.010
Oh, so you hear that?

19:08.689 --> 19:10.857
I'm really sorry I was mean to you.

19:10.891 --> 19:13.959
- Why were you doing that?
- It's complicated.

19:13.994 --> 19:18.530
I just want you to know that I
read a book... - You read a book?

19:18.564 --> 19:21.366
Oh, no wonder you
were so irritable.

19:22.267 --> 19:24.869
No, I actually liked it.

19:24.903 --> 19:28.105
And it got me thinking that,
if you ever want to write stories

19:28.139 --> 19:30.974
about my life and publish them,
I give you permission.

19:31.008 --> 19:34.175
Why would I want to do that? I already
know what I'm gonna do in the future.

19:34.210 --> 19:36.810
I'm gonna run a very successful
paint-a-plate business.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.680
Oh. Paint-a-plate business?
That's a good idea.

19:40.715 --> 19:42.849
But you know what else
you'd be really good at?

19:42.883 --> 19:45.119
Writing stories about
our wizard adventures.

19:45.153 --> 19:49.723
I will need something to do while
myork is in the kiln. - Ah!

19:49.757 --> 19:53.093
See? I even have a great
title for your first story.

19:53.127 --> 19:58.196
- Gander of the Futurenauts.
- Yeah...

19:58.231 --> 19:59.865
I'll think of something.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.269
So, we're not mad at
each other anymore?

20:04.303 --> 20:08.273
No. I just hope that we're gonna
be friends for a really long time.

20:08.307 --> 20:11.842
Alex, is that what you'r afid of?
That we're wouldn't be friends?

20:11.877 --> 20:14.345
Well, I was afraid of that,
but not anymore.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.714
I'm pretty sure we're going
to be friends forever.

20:39.072 --> 20:43.074
You know, you should practice mouthing
words so people can understand them.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.543
I am pretty bad at that.

20:48.279 --> 20:50.246
Oh, my gosh.

20:52.082 --> 20:55.185
That's the greatest hat
I've ever seen! Excuse me...

20:55.219 --> 20:57.420
I just love that hat.
Where can I get one?

20:57.454 --> 21:02.124
- Here, you can have this one.
- I can't take this from you.

21:02.158 --> 21:04.426
Consider it a loan.

21:04.460 --> 21:07.395
Well, how will I
get it back to you?

21:07.429 --> 21:11.899
- Um... I'll get it back to her.
- You know her?

21:11.934 --> 21:15.102
Yeah. She's an old friend of mine.

21:19.378 --> 21:22.580
Oh. Hi, I'm Selena Gomez.

21:22.614 --> 21:26.316
In this episode, my character starts
out not liking reading very much,

21:26.350 --> 21:30.052
but by the end of the episode,
Alex learns how important reading can be.

21:30.087 --> 21:34.857
Reading can save lives.
Like "Exit," in case of a fire.

21:34.891 --> 21:37.859
Or, "Hey, this bottle
has poison in it."

21:38.194 --> 21:43.530
But, probably not that, because they
usually have the skull and cross bones on
it. Anyway...

21:43.565 --> 21:49.104
The point is, I love reading.
And so does my friend,

21:49.138 --> 21:52.907
writer, producer,
actor and director, Rob Reiner.

21:52.941 --> 21:54.475
Oh, hi!

21:54.509 --> 21:56.944
I love reading, too.

21:59.613 --> 22:02.714
Like I should've read the
expiration date on this milk.

22:07.553 --> 22:10.621
Oh, Rob. Yes, he should have.

22:12.491 --> 22:16.059
But, I think you
should love reading, to

22:16.094 --> 22:19.596
Hi, I'm Selena Gomez.
In this episode, my char... Oh, wait.

22:19.630 --> 22:22.332
No, I alady read this. OK.
I'm done. Let's go, Rob.
