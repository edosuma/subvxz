00:01.320 --> 00:05.480
I've spoken to my wife.

00:06.880 --> 00:09.520
His name's Louie. He's seven.

00:09.520 --> 00:11.320
I don't get to see him enough.

00:11.320 --> 00:12.880
His dad's got custody.

00:14.320 --> 00:18.000
The lab report on the stone fragment
in Sophie's head wound.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.880
(LAUGHS) Lloyd just brings me
the papers and I sign them.

00:20.880 --> 00:22.320
Lloyd Macklin?
Yes.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.760
He grew up in the house next door.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.040
I need you here to make sure

00:26.040 --> 00:28.120
the sale of Winston Station
goes through.

00:28.120 --> 00:31.520
I took a position that will earn me
a substantial profit

00:31.520 --> 00:32.760
when the sale goes ahead.

00:32.760 --> 00:34.360
I'm on the hook for 2 mill.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.120
We'll have to sell the house.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.400
Not if you strike a trade deal.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.920
I'm supposed to write
government policy

00:38.920 --> 00:40.680
to save your grubby little deal?

00:40.680 --> 00:43.360
I don't think we need
to keep you two. Do you, Greg?

00:43.360 --> 00:46.600
No, no. It's probably best we keep
this briefing off the record.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.560
You're aware they used to be lovers?

00:48.560 --> 00:51.120
I know they used to be friends.

00:51.120 --> 00:55.200
Friends with benefits,
which I assume they've resumed.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.520
Everyone knows those trade talks
are bogged down,

00:57.520 --> 01:00.040
but you're making it sound like
it was a done deal.

01:00.040 --> 01:02.800
If any of those bastards
were involved in Sophie's death,

01:02.800 --> 01:04.360
we're taking them down.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.040
What is it that you do, Meg?

02:01.480 --> 02:02.720
Do you know him at all?

02:02.720 --> 02:05.560
Lloyd? Only by reputation.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.240
Which is?

02:07.240 --> 02:08.880
Mm.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.480
Impressive.

02:10.480 --> 02:12.240

02:15.000 --> 02:17.280
What are you doing up so late?

02:17.280 --> 02:18.760
Anna rang me.

02:18.760 --> 02:20.320
Ah.

02:26.640 --> 02:29.480
Do you really admire a guy
who loves money that much?

02:29.480 --> 02:30.720
He loves winning.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.280
I don't think he cares about money.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.520
Mmm...

02:34.520 --> 02:35.600
His house.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.360
Well, he has to spend it
on something.

02:37.360 --> 02:40.360
Apparently, the landscaping alone
costs like a million bucks.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.120
Did you notice the patio by the lawn
above the pool?

02:43.120 --> 02:44.120
No.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.200
So, someone told me

02:45.200 --> 02:48.640
that Lloyd saw the tiles
while he was holidaying in Italy

02:48.640 --> 02:50.480
and they came from the same quarry

02:50.480 --> 02:53.560
as the marble that Michelangelo used
for his David.

02:53.560 --> 02:54.800
Same era too.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.400
Wait.

03:02.680 --> 03:03.880
Was it Carrara?

03:03.880 --> 03:05.000
I don't know.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.160
What's Michelangelo's David
made out of?

03:10.720 --> 03:15.800
So, how did Anna describe my reaction
to the news that she wants a divorce?

03:17.160 --> 03:19.800
Oh, she hadn't spoken to you yet.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.360
Oh. Hang on.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.760
So, you knew I was getting
a divorce before I did?

03:26.920 --> 03:29.600
Well, she wanted to know
how I thought you'd react.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.320
And what did you say?

03:33.320 --> 03:35.400
Stoically.
Ha!

03:35.400 --> 03:37.560
How did you react?

03:37.560 --> 03:39.120
Phlegmatically.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.920
(LAUGHS) What's the difference?

03:40.920 --> 03:42.040
There isn't one.

03:43.320 --> 03:46.200
I just didn't want to give you
the satisfaction of being right.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.800
I'm sorry.
What for?

Oh, well.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.400
What's going on?

04:17.400 --> 04:19.120
You're going to have to go now.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.320
Now?

04:22.720 --> 04:26.080
Don't think you have to stay up
and keep me company.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.440
You'll be alright?

04:27.440 --> 04:28.520

04:42.160 --> 04:43.200
Meg?

04:43.200 --> 04:44.920
According to the lab report,

04:44.920 --> 04:47.720
the stone in the gash
on Sophie's head was high-grade,

04:47.720 --> 04:50.280
centuries-old Carrara marble.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.880
Do you know what else is?

04:51.880 --> 04:54.800
Meg, it's 2am.

If that were the case, I wouldn't
have to bail you out, would I?

There's a very good chance that
I will be the next Prime Minister.

The press will be sniffing around
for any dirt they can find on me.

You need to put as much distance
between yourself and Lloyd

than I'd anticipated.

13:31.360 --> 13:34.840
But that is what
they are going to believe,

13:34.840 --> 13:37.360
because we're going to come up
with a story right now

13:37.360 --> 13:42.280
that neither of you two will deviate
from in the slightest detail.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.880
Just, is this going to take long?

13:45.880 --> 13:49.040
Because we're actually supposed to be
meeting the boys for beers later.

13:49.040 --> 13:52.120
I'm not sure you fully appreciate
the gravity of this situation.

13:52.120 --> 13:53.520
Never mind tonight,

13:53.520 --> 13:55.960
if you screw this up, you're not
going to be seeing the boys

13:55.960 --> 13:57.560
for another five years.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.880
I need to brief Greg
on the trade talks tonight.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.320
Again?
He's the Leader of the Opposition.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.800
You're treating him like he matters.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.600
Well, if the polls are right,
he soon will.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.480
Best to get him onside early.

14:17.480 --> 14:23.480
So I'll need the room
from 7:00 till 10:00, I'd say.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.760
What? What am I going to do?

14:25.760 --> 14:26.920
I don't know.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.960
Go to the cinema.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.280
You like movies.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.800
There must be
some good Australian films.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.760
(DOOR OPENS)
Ben, good morning.

14:38.760 --> 14:39.840
Morning.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.720
How was your evening?

14:41.720 --> 14:42.960
Uh, quiet.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.640
Spent it in my room.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.760
Oh, you must get out.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.720
Simon's going to a movie tonight.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.120
You can go together.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.240
There - sorted.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.800
Make yourself at home, Ben.
I'll be five minutes.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.080
Oh, and confirm Greg Hardy
for this evening.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.440
Well, you look annoyingly chipper.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.520
Is that what London cops say?

15:13.520 --> 15:14.840
Alright, Guv?

15:14.840 --> 15:16.240
Yeah, chipper.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.560
I did say annoying, didn't I?

15:19.560 --> 15:23.120
Hey, Tom Macklin and Oscar Aruzzi
are in reception.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.600
Do you get the sense
we're getting close?

15:31.720 --> 15:33.520
I'd like it noted for the record

15:33.520 --> 15:36.160
that Mr Aruzzi volunteered
to come here today

15:36.160 --> 15:38.680
out of a deep desire
to do all he can

15:38.680 --> 15:40.880
to help the police
with their inquiries.

15:41.920 --> 15:44.840
I thought you were
Lloyd Macklin's lawyer, Mr Weaver.

15:46.200 --> 15:49.240
I have more than one client.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.600
What is it you want to tell us, Tom?

15:51.600 --> 15:53.840
Exactly what happened that night.

15:53.840 --> 15:56.840
You mean you've been lying to us
up until now?

15:56.840 --> 16:00.200
May I suggest that that accusation
is not constructive,

16:00.200 --> 16:03.520
nor in the spirit of cooperation
that brings Mr Macklin here today?

16:04.560 --> 16:06.240
Well, that's told you.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.800
Forensics have found
tiny specks of Sophie's blood

16:10.800 --> 16:12.680
and a lot of cleaning fluid.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.960
So, as you can imagine,
we're all ears.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.040
After we left the party,

16:18.040 --> 16:19.960
Sophie went off for a drink
with Erica.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.080
Oscar and me went back to my place.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.040
Well, my dad's.

16:24.040 --> 16:27.600
We carried on drinking,
played games, smoked a bit of weed.

16:27.600 --> 16:30.160
Bro, smoke that motherfucker.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.520
Sophie turned up about 11:30.

16:32.520 --> 16:33.640
Soph?

16:34.960 --> 16:36.360
Hi.

16:36.360 --> 16:37.640
Are you OK?

16:39.640 --> 16:42.880
We'd had a row, so I didn't think
she was talking to me.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.800
Alright. Yeah.
Well, I'll see you soon.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.920
(VIDEOGAME SOUNDS)

16:47.920 --> 16:48.920
Ahem.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.720
Thanks.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.280
I would have used my own, but...

16:55.280 --> 16:56.720
I'll buy you a new one.

16:56.720 --> 16:57.880
We need to talk.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.240
Um, maybe I should go home.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.320
No, I want you both to hear this.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.120
I didn't like the way
you treated me on the boat.

17:10.120 --> 17:11.680
Well, I didn't like the way
you were behaving.

17:11.680 --> 17:13.200
You don't own me.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.320
You're my girlfriend, Soph.

17:15.320 --> 17:17.000
It didn't stop you
from shagging that girl at work.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.240
Oh, my God.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.480
I have told you that
that meant nothing.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.440
Neither did it when I fucked Oscar.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.680
Get off. Stop it!

18:14.680 --> 18:16.800
Now, I'll tell you word for word

18:16.800 --> 18:18.560
exactly what Oscar is going to say
happened next.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.720
Well, go on, then.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.480
Oscar is going to say
that we were fighting...

18:24.480 --> 18:25.920
BOTH: ..and an arm lashed out.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.280
I don't know whose it was...

18:27.280 --> 18:29.000
..but it collected Sophie
on the side of the head...

18:29.000 --> 18:30.720
..and she fell
and she hit her head on the tiles.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.360
And he'll tell you
it was an accident.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.480
It was an accident.
There was blood everywhere.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.640
She was dead.
One blow, just like that.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.440
There was nothing
we could do for her.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.800
And we panicked.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.480
We thought we'd get the blame.

18:44.440 --> 18:47.560
So we carried her body down
to the water and we chucked it in.

18:49.160 --> 18:52.600
The current is really strong there,
so we knew she'd get washed away.

18:56.040 --> 18:59.880
Then we went to a bar so we'd have
an alibi in case anybody asked.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.480
That's what he'll tell you.

19:01.480 --> 19:03.400
But that's not what happened?

19:03.400 --> 19:05.160
Not quite.

19:05.160 --> 19:06.160
No.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.200
So what did happen?

19:09.200 --> 19:11.520
In exchange for his testimony,

19:11.520 --> 19:15.040
my client will require immunity
from prosecution.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.720
That's above my pay grade.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.400
By quite a distance.

19:18.400 --> 19:22.320
But all we're seeking today,
which you can approve, I'm sure,

19:22.320 --> 19:23.880
is an induced statement

19:23.880 --> 19:25.960
confirming that the information
provided by my client

19:25.960 --> 19:27.640
cannot be used against him.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.480
Alright, bro?

19:43.480 --> 19:45.080
You follow the script?

19:45.080 --> 19:46.840
Yeah, to the tee.

might be a start.

He'll be back in tomorrow.

20:13.920 --> 20:15.280
You don't seem very happy

20:15.280 --> 20:16.960
for someone
that's just cracked the case.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.640
I've cracked nothing.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.120
They've handed it over.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.440
Still, we know what happened.

20:22.440 --> 20:23.600
Do we?

20:24.880 --> 20:27.000
But I thought we were telling
the same story.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.840
Oscar, you know I think of you
as a son.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.160
Better than, usually.

20:31.160 --> 20:36.000
But despite his faults, and the list
is too long to go through right now,

20:36.000 --> 20:37.440
he is my son,

20:37.440 --> 20:40.160
which means he cannot
get a criminal conviction.

20:40.160 --> 20:44.520
Even a charge would destroy
his reputation and damage mine.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.440
What about my reputation?

20:46.440 --> 20:47.600
Oh, son...

20:48.960 --> 20:51.120
..you don't have a reputation.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.440
Lloyd, if I may...

20:53.440 --> 20:54.440
Gary.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.440
As it stands, you could
both be facing a number of charges,

20:56.440 --> 20:58.080
but I don't think
murder's one of them.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.240
We didn't murder her.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.560
Causing death by misadventure,
disposing of her body...

21:01.560 --> 21:02.840
We didn't do that either.

21:02.840 --> 21:04.400
Failure to report a death.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.840
If the police accept the deal
we're proposing,

21:07.840 --> 21:09.400
then Tom will escape prosecution,

21:09.400 --> 21:13.000
and you...you won't be charged
with any serious offences.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.920
Why would they go for that?

21:14.920 --> 21:18.080
Because the DPP wants a conviction,
any conviction,

21:18.080 --> 21:20.240
and at the moment we're their best
chance of securing one.

21:20.240 --> 21:21.840
By making me a scapegoat.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.920
There's a very good chance
you won't be found guilty.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.720
But we are guilty.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.040
We left her there.
We didn't try and get help.

21:29.040 --> 21:31.240

21:31.240 --> 21:33.880
You're also guilty
of supplying drugs, Oscar.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.040
Nah, still nothing.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.720
And despite his intermittent hearing,

21:36.720 --> 21:38.200
he's actually the best lawyer
in Sydney.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.400
Certainly the most expensive,

21:39.400 --> 21:41.800
so I hope that makes him the best.

21:41.800 --> 21:46.040
And right now,
he's representing you at my expense.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.920
Can you guarantee
that I won't go to prison?

21:52.920 --> 21:54.920
Of course he can. Gary?

21:54.920 --> 21:56.760
Yes, absolutely.

37:32.520 --> 37:34.720
He doesn't care about you.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.040
He'd sell you down the river
if the price was right.

37:37.040 --> 37:38.600
And it sounds like he already has.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.080
Listen...

37:45.920 --> 37:48.320
..ask your lawyer
to put that guarantee,

37:48.320 --> 37:50.760
and anything else
you've been promised, in writing.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.440
And if he won't...

37:54.520 --> 37:56.120
..ask yourself why.

38:07.240 --> 38:09.480
I am delighted to announce

38:09.480 --> 38:11.680
that my Australian counterpart and I

38:11.680 --> 38:14.440
have today agreed terms
on a trade deal

38:14.440 --> 38:19.080
that will be of enormous benefit
to both our countries.

38:19.080 --> 38:23.520
Australia is the UK's
19th largest trading partner,

38:23.520 --> 38:25.880
and we believe there is the potential

38:25.880 --> 38:28.120
for the exchange
of both goods and services...

38:28.120 --> 38:30.200
What the fuck is she playing at?!

38:30.200 --> 38:32.760
..between our great nations.

38:32.760 --> 38:34.120
While negotiations...

38:34.120 --> 38:36.840
I can't believe what I am hearing.
What the hell is she doing?

38:36.840 --> 38:39.720
Justin. Justin, if I had known,
I would have told you.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.600
Mate, she has rolled over.

38:41.600 --> 38:43.920
OK, she has given Canberra
everything that they wanted.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.880
This is as much of a surprise to me.

38:45.880 --> 38:48.720
REPORTER: Isn't this
a complete capitulation
by the British government?

38:48.720 --> 38:50.400
Not in the slightest.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.480
Both sides have made concessions.

38:52.480 --> 38:55.000
The growth in trade
will benefit everyone.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.840
You know, you journalists
love to think that if someone wins,

38:58.840 --> 39:01.200
someone else must lose.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.880
But international relations
are not like that,

39:03.880 --> 39:06.640
particularly with regard to trade.

39:06.640 --> 39:09.520
It is possible
for both sides to win...

39:09.520 --> 39:10.600
Yeah.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.640
She came through in the end.

39:12.640 --> 39:15.280
I really don't know
what caused the change of heart.

39:15.280 --> 39:18.720
I've got Gary Weaver for you.
He says it's urgent.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.000
Tell him we're busy.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.040
His exact words were,

39:21.040 --> 39:22.880
"I don't care if he's taking a shit.
Put him on."

39:22.880 --> 39:25.880
ABIGAIL: ..many of your colleagues
in the Australian press corps...

39:25.880 --> 39:29.200
I am very happy
with the terms we negotiated...

39:29.200 --> 39:32.360
Gary.
We have a major problem.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.320
I honestly don't know
which of us hit her.

39:40.320 --> 39:41.800
But neither of us meant to.

39:43.640 --> 39:45.960
I think she was out
before she hit the ground.

39:47.040 --> 39:49.720
I know her head
bounced off the paving slab.

39:53.400 --> 39:54.800
I felt sick.

39:56.680 --> 39:58.640
We froze.

39:58.640 --> 40:01.320
And, um...then the blood started.

40:03.880 --> 40:05.560
That's when we panicked.

40:07.400 --> 40:08.640
Oh, fuck.

40:08.640 --> 40:09.640
Oh, f...

40:10.840 --> 40:11.840
Fuck.

40:13.560 --> 40:14.920
Bro, I think she's dead.

40:14.920 --> 40:16.600
Fuck, fuck, fuck...

40:16.600 --> 40:18.080
Tom called his dad.

40:18.080 --> 40:21.280
He told us to get out of there.
That he'd sort it.

40:21.280 --> 40:22.640
We've got to call an ambulance!

40:22.640 --> 40:24.080
Dad says we should go.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.200
We've got to go, man.
We've got to go.

40:26.200 --> 40:27.960
Mate, for fuck's sake!

40:27.960 --> 40:29.760
Fucking come on.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.440
Come on.

40:33.720 --> 40:34.920
Um...

40:36.560 --> 40:39.400
We went to a bar and made sure
we were caught on camera.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.880
A few hours later,
we went back to Tom's place...

40:55.200 --> 40:56.920
..and Sophie had gone.

40:58.720 --> 41:00.320
Hang on.

41:00.320 --> 41:03.640
You're saying you and Tom didn't dump
Sophie's body in the harbour?

41:03.640 --> 41:04.640
No.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.720
That must have been Lloyd.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.240
Oh, fuck!

41:22.560 --> 41:24.120
MEG: Lloyd needs to be
held to account.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.480
But he'll just deny it all

41:25.480 --> 41:27.320
and then it's his word
against Oscar's.

41:27.320 --> 41:29.120
And who are people going to believe?

41:29.120 --> 41:30.760
What have you told the police?

41:30.760 --> 41:31.760
The truth.

41:31.760 --> 41:33.200
You shouldn't have done that.

41:33.200 --> 41:35.120
You think Lloyd would give himself up
to save his son?

41:35.120 --> 41:37.200
Well, you would, for Louie.

41:37.200 --> 41:38.960
Look, I just want
the chance to explain.

41:38.960 --> 41:41.640
You played me, Abigail,
right from the fucking start.

41:41.640 --> 41:43.600
I'm going to move out
when I get back home.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.560
I'm going to miss you.

41:45.560 --> 41:48.760
One of the tabloids has another clip
of the PM with his wife.

41:48.760 --> 41:50.600
It's the final nail in his coffin.

41:50.600 --> 41:51.960
We're missing something.

41:51.960 --> 41:53.160
Knowledge is power...

41:53.160 --> 41:54.600
This is where Sophie died.

41:54.600 --> 41:57.040
..to be used
when it's to your best advantage.

41:58.200 --> 42:00.200
