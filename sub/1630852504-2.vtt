00:02.370 --> 00:04.703
- Detective samantha wazowski,
guns and gangs!

00:04.772 --> 00:07.039
- Detective kelly duff,
drug squad!

00:07.108 --> 00:08.707
- I think it's really weird
that we haven't met yet.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.609
- Do you mind if I get back
to arresting this guy?!

00:10.611 --> 00:12.011
- Are you aware that you left

00:12.146 --> 00:13.912
Your son alone in the residence
of a known drug dealer?

00:14.048 --> 00:16.582
- Of course not. I left him
with my stepdaughter.

00:16.584 --> 00:18.917
-<i> Your daughter was on the scene</i>
<i>and she didn't identify herself.</i>

00:18.986 --> 00:20.853
- It's hard to wrangle
an 18-year-old.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.454
- I have a 17-year-old son so...

00:22.523 --> 00:25.256
- Elliot! Would you like me
to bring down the capital g?

00:25.292 --> 00:28.326
- Your gun?
- No! Oh, my gosh, no!
I mean grounded!

00:28.396 --> 00:31.997
- You left a 9-year-old boy
alone in rafi's
house with a gun.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.731
Are you saying
that we should cut her a deal?

00:33.768 --> 00:36.001
- You know, if she cooperated
and helped us find rafi.

00:36.070 --> 00:39.604
- Rick! What are
you doing with rafi?
- Rafi works for me.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.274
- Rick was bringing in
goddamn drugs, and
we were getting a cut.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.275
Otherwise, my company
would be tits up by now!

00:44.311 --> 00:46.010
- Hands on your head!
-<i> Someone's gonna take</i>

00:46.047 --> 00:48.947
Rick's place.
- These people, they're scary.

00:49.016 --> 00:53.118
- Oh no, baby. The scariest bear
in the woods is the mama bear.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.657
(duff clearing her throat)
- (duff): Testing, testing.

00:59.693 --> 01:01.826
(indistinct chatter)

01:01.862 --> 01:03.628
Donut holes in the house!

01:03.664 --> 01:06.631
Three-pointer coming
at you, boo! You're driving.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.234
- Hey! Maybe don't throw
things at me, ok?

01:09.369 --> 01:11.103
'cause I don't like it,
I never played ball,

01:11.238 --> 01:13.705
And I hate frisbee.
- Dang! Your childhood

01:13.741 --> 01:15.841
Must have been bleak.
- It was.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.176
- Oh, here's the captain
of the green team!

01:18.312 --> 01:20.579
Smile for the camera.
Hey, tell me something, jimmy;

01:20.648 --> 01:22.514
Why do you boys even need guns?

01:22.583 --> 01:24.382
People don't care
about weed anymore.

01:24.384 --> 01:27.653
- People still care about weed.
- Haha! Joking, joking!

01:29.590 --> 01:32.491
Sorensen, get your ass
back to guns and gangs.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.292
- I'm going! I'm going!

01:35.863 --> 01:37.862
- Oh, my god!
You look ridiculous.

01:37.898 --> 01:41.399
- I look ridiculous? Have you
seen yourself in the mirror?

01:41.435 --> 01:43.334
- Hey, listen,
I got coffee on my pants;

01:43.370 --> 01:45.670
You in the other hand are
dressed in a fast-food uniform.

01:45.706 --> 01:48.240
The job suits you by the way.
- Policing undercover, it does.

01:48.375 --> 01:51.042
Bank tellering suits you
very well, granny panties.

01:51.112 --> 01:53.612
- Teller, it's not a word.
- Well, you know what is a word?

01:53.747 --> 01:56.882
Cocaine. And here's
another word: Burger bucket.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.284
- That's two words.
- You know what? Let me string

01:59.419 --> 02:02.154
Those two thoughts together
for you. Someone is trafficking

02:02.289 --> 02:04.689
Cocaine out of a burger bucket
next to a high school,

02:04.758 --> 02:07.693
So I'm going deep.
- Ok, in my world,

02:07.695 --> 02:10.629
Undercover is just
a fancy word for dress-up.
- Yeah, well, in my world,

02:10.764 --> 02:13.298
Only little girls wear flowers
on their underpants.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.033
- Well, is it granny panties
or little girl panties?

02:15.169 --> 02:16.568
Why don't you make up
your mind, duff?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.303
- I don't know,
how about an overall

02:18.305 --> 02:19.904
People-who-aren't-getting-any
kind of panties?

02:19.940 --> 02:22.240
Hoohoo!
Hahaha! Yes!

02:22.276 --> 02:24.276
I gotta show the guys this
and see what kind of insults

02:24.411 --> 02:26.445
They come up with. Haha!

02:26.580 --> 02:30.449
Got it on camera. Now, I gotta
be honest, you look like a fool.

02:30.584 --> 02:34.253
- ♪ nothin' for nothin'
leaves nothin' ♪

02:34.388 --> 02:36.655
♪ you gotta have something
if you wanna ♪

02:36.724 --> 02:38.724
♪ be with me ♪

02:38.726 --> 02:41.326
♪ yeah, nothin' from nothin' ♪

02:41.362 --> 02:43.528
♪ leaves nothin' ♪
- what do you want me to do, t?

02:43.564 --> 02:45.797
Hmm?
- I don't know,

02:45.799 --> 02:48.132
But thanks to you, jackie's
all tangled up with the police.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.868
- Is she gonna have a record?

02:49.937 --> 02:51.803
- You better hope not.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.871
And sol pulled
a gun on a cop.

02:53.908 --> 02:55.807
- See. Now, you can wash
your hands of me

02:55.843 --> 02:58.142
Because who knows when the hell
I'll get out of here.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.744
- I'll just go back
to scrambling to keep

02:59.780 --> 03:01.479
My dad's company afloat.
Kids will never have anything.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.548
No money for college, nothing.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.885
(sighing)

03:10.157 --> 03:12.691
Have the bowens
taken over your route?

03:12.760 --> 03:14.493
They're still
gonna cut me in?

03:14.628 --> 03:17.029
- Buffalo won't work
with those guys.

03:17.031 --> 03:19.431
The bowens are flexing way too
much, plus they're hard-headed.

03:19.566 --> 03:22.034
That's why I import,
and they distribute.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.109
- How about I keep it
running for you?

03:31.111 --> 03:33.911
(chuckling)
just tell the guys in buffalo

03:33.948 --> 03:35.780
It's status quo.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.049
Hey, I got the cube trucks.

03:38.118 --> 03:40.719
I can bring it across myself.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.655
Better for buffalo if I'm taking
the border risk, right?

03:43.657 --> 03:46.391
You set this up for me,

03:46.460 --> 03:48.460
I'll cut you in.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.029
- You want in the game?

03:52.533 --> 03:55.867
Same old tig, always wanting
what somebody else ordered.

03:55.903 --> 03:59.538
- No, rick. I just want a roof
over our son's head.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.073
And I don't see anyone else
in your visitor log, alright?

04:02.142 --> 04:05.410
Right now, I'm all you got.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.215
- Covert unit's gonna ask you
a few questions,

04:10.350 --> 04:12.083
And then you'll be officially
carded as an informant.

04:12.119 --> 04:14.152
(cell phone ringing)
oh! Just a second.

04:15.555 --> 04:17.288
Uh...

04:17.324 --> 04:19.825
Hey, elli, what's up?
Your birthday is not

04:19.827 --> 04:22.094
For another six months;
I am not giving you $500.

04:22.229 --> 04:24.830
Well, if he is so great,
then why is he selling

04:24.965 --> 04:26.832
His clothes out
of a parking lot? I am working,

04:26.967 --> 04:28.900
Goodbye.
(indistinct chatter)

04:29.036 --> 04:32.337
- Is that your son?
- Hi. I'm detective--

04:32.373 --> 04:33.705
- Detective braith
from covert unit.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.707
She's gonna be conducting
your interview.

04:35.743 --> 04:38.910
- Nice to meet you. It's pretty
painless. Just a few questions--

04:38.912 --> 04:41.246
- What your involvement is,
all that good stuff.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.582
- I don't know anything.
- Really? Because your boyfriend

04:43.584 --> 04:45.383
Is rafi bowen
from the stockwood crew,

04:45.519 --> 04:47.319
And he is brother
to randy and steph bowen,

04:47.454 --> 04:49.321
And your stepdad is
their back end, so you know

04:49.390 --> 04:50.455
A few people,
I am sure. Ok.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.393
- I don't know anything else

04:55.429 --> 04:58.130
About the stockwoods. I gave
you guys everything that I had.

04:58.265 --> 04:59.997
You're so convinced
that the only people

05:00.034 --> 05:02.667
Who are committing crimes
are from my neighbourhood,

05:02.736 --> 05:04.603
But criminals are
all over the place.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.538
- Ok, you know what?
I'll take whatever you got.

05:06.607 --> 05:09.341
You know, doesn't have to be
the stockwood crew.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.676
- Ok. I was at a party
in rosedale the other day,

05:11.745 --> 05:13.411
And some random girl
shot up the pool house.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.247
But that has nothing
to do with the stockwoods.

05:15.382 --> 05:18.149
- Sounds like a good tip.
- Oh yeah, ok. You know what?

05:18.185 --> 05:20.218
I'm happy to look
into this random chick.

05:22.323 --> 05:24.289
- It's brandy lynch.
She lives in summerhill.

05:24.424 --> 05:26.491
- Ok, great. I am on it
unless, of course,

05:26.493 --> 05:29.327
Detective braith, if you--
- not even a little bit.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.296
- So--
- no.

05:31.431 --> 05:32.230
- Ok, so...

05:34.702 --> 05:36.835
- Hey, detective nathan green!

05:36.904 --> 05:39.704
How's drug squad treating you?
- Uh, it's alright. I'm good.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.572
- Are you sure? You don't
need that to keep awake?

05:41.608 --> 05:44.041
- Ha ha.
- 'cause you know, it's so zzz!

05:44.078 --> 05:46.178
Hahaha! I'm joking.
- I know.

05:46.313 --> 05:49.381
- I'm just having a joke!
You're great at your job!

05:49.450 --> 05:51.983
Ok, I'm just getting
a cof... Ok.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.925
- Detective wazowski!
Tiggy sullivan.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.993
We met last week.
- Oh yeah, I remember you. Hi.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.062
- Yeah. I'm just here
waiting for jackie.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.931
Do you know how long you guys
are gonna be, like,

06:06.967 --> 06:09.033
Talking to her for or...?

06:09.069 --> 06:12.137
- I don't know, just like...
As long as it takes.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.139
- I get it.
I-I would just...

06:14.274 --> 06:16.007
I'd hate for it to get out
that she's helping the cops

06:16.009 --> 06:18.677
Take down the bowens,
you know?

06:18.812 --> 06:20.912
I mean, I'm assuming
that's who you're going after.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.480
Which is... Good.

06:24.351 --> 06:25.817
Teenagers, am I right?
- Yeah...

06:25.819 --> 06:27.084
- You have a son?
- Yeah.

06:27.121 --> 06:28.753
- Does he get
into trouble a lot or...?

06:28.789 --> 06:30.288
- Listen, you just have
a great day, ok?

06:30.357 --> 06:32.090
- Ok. Nice seeing you.
- Bye!

06:33.961 --> 06:37.028
- Woman: [you made me
get rid of the cat; I don't
even believe in allergies!]

06:37.097 --> 06:39.097
- What?
- [omg. "you know, duvets,]

06:39.099 --> 06:41.366
[I'm allergic."]
-<i> the burger face side down...</i>

06:41.368 --> 06:43.702
- [no flowers, no kittens
or peanuts or joy]

06:43.704 --> 06:47.506
[or happiness. That's why
we're divorcing!]
-<i> now remember,</i>

06:47.508 --> 06:49.708
It's one sheet per burger.
No more, alright?

06:49.710 --> 06:51.776
These things cost money.
- Saving money,

06:51.779 --> 06:53.511
That's the name of the game
here at burger bucket.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.247
- Kelly, meet chester.
- Hey.

06:56.316 --> 06:58.650
Call me kickstart.
- Kickstart, huh?

06:58.785 --> 07:00.919
That's a fun name.
- Yeah, I keep

07:00.988 --> 07:02.988
Telling him he's not gonna
climb the corporate ladder

07:02.990 --> 07:06.123
With a name like that. But you,
you might have a chance.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.260
I'm thinking you might
be connected.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.062
Boss usually lets me
do the hiring.

07:11.198 --> 07:14.332
Anyway... Chester,
you are in charge.

07:14.368 --> 07:16.067
Show kelly here the ropes, ok?

07:16.136 --> 07:18.135
I'm off
to my physio appointment.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.805
I have
a repetitive stress injury.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.874
Carpal tunnel. Ah.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.076
Alright, I'll be back
in an hour, ok?

07:25.078 --> 07:26.878
I'm leaving my keys.
♪♪

07:28.348 --> 07:31.950
- All righty! Let's talk
deep fryer, shall we?

07:32.085 --> 07:35.086
Ever work one of these babies?

07:35.222 --> 07:36.688
- No.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.227
(buzzing and beeping)

07:42.229 --> 07:44.162
- Brandy lynch.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.030
Brandy, brandy...
You know what?

07:46.066 --> 07:48.199
My grandmother now,
she had a dog named brandy.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.435
It was a nasty thing.
It was smelly.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.970
It got muddy paws on you.
It even ate its own poo.

07:53.006 --> 07:56.107
But even that brandy would never
endanger innocent lives.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.878
Oh, ok.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.914
Really? It's all on social.
The whole thing's recorded.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.650
- I was protecting myself.

08:05.785 --> 08:07.586
- Oh, right! By brandishing
a loaded weapon

08:07.721 --> 08:09.787
And just shooting it
into a pool house.

08:09.789 --> 08:11.856
That's protecting yourself?
- But it is if you've met andy.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.758
- Andy's your boyfriend?
- One of them.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.194
- I'm sorry...
(chuckling)

08:16.329 --> 08:19.397
...But from where I'm standing,
getting a boyfriend is

08:19.399 --> 08:21.933
A challenge, but, oh, what,
you've managed to get several?

08:21.969 --> 08:24.602
- I'm part of a "throuple."
yeah. Ok, it's me,

08:24.738 --> 08:26.871
Andy and brad.
I tried to end it,

08:26.940 --> 08:30.207
And andy started stalking me.
- So you bought yourself a gun?

08:30.244 --> 08:32.877
- I... Borrowed it
to scare him off.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.146
- What type of gun is it?
Where is it now?

08:35.182 --> 08:37.949
- It's a smith & wesson.
I dumped it in the lake.

08:37.951 --> 08:41.086
I got spooked.
- Who loaned it to you?

08:41.088 --> 08:43.021
- A friend of a friend.
- Is she part of the throuple?

08:43.090 --> 08:45.357
- A "throuple" is three, so no.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.025
- Where did she get the gun?!

08:47.160 --> 08:49.226
- I think maybe she mentioned
a dollar store

08:49.263 --> 08:51.763
In the west end.
I really can't remember.

08:51.832 --> 08:55.100
- That's totally fine. Guess
what we're gonna do. We're gonna
pull all the security footage

08:55.235 --> 08:57.035
From every dollar store west of
dufferin. You and, we're gonna

08:57.104 --> 08:59.303
Get together, sit down, we're
gonna watch all that footage.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.373
Should only take
about... Two months.

09:01.508 --> 09:04.442
- What? Ok, I have a job.

09:04.444 --> 09:06.578
- It's fine. We'll just call
your boss and tell them

09:06.713 --> 09:08.847

- Why are you saying
deals like that?

15:27.794 --> 15:30.895

It's like dealz times three.

It's owned by ed o'farrell
who's turning 80.

15:34.233 --> 15:37.702
And two years ago, he hired
one wayne revenzo.
- Ah, let me guess.

Wayne has a rap sheet.
- Mm-hmm. A "throuple" of frauds

And one theft by conversion.
- Ok, so?

15:42.943 --> 15:44.976
- Well, ok. I went in there,
I was trying

15:45.045 --> 15:47.044
To seize him up, and then--
- you reeked cop.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.880
- Yes, which is why
I need you to go in there

15:48.882 --> 15:50.648
Reeking like anything else,
which I feel really won't be

15:50.717 --> 15:52.850

So please...

15:52.919 --> 15:55.987
- Ok. Let me
call you back.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.389
Tell me this wayne guy
doesn't have

15:58.425 --> 16:00.591
A police officer in his family.
- Not that I'm aware of. Why?

16:02.595 --> 16:06.063
- The bullet that brandy shot
into the pool house, turns out

16:06.132 --> 16:09.666
It is a match for a test bullet
that was used in a crime

16:09.703 --> 16:11.669
Two years ago.
- I'm sorry, I'm confused.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.604
- The gun was confiscated
by the islington police

16:13.606 --> 16:15.807
Who sent it off to be destroyed,
but somehow it made

16:15.942 --> 16:17.808
Its way back out
and onto the streets.

16:17.877 --> 16:20.277
So now I am worried that we are
dealing with a dirty cop

16:20.347 --> 16:23.748
Who is stealing confiscated guns
and selling them.

16:23.883 --> 16:27.518
Duff, get in there and confirm
wayne revenzo is selling guns.
- Yeah, absolutely.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.387
- And then we'll shake him down
for his back end. Really?

We need to tie this up fast.
And keep it to yourselves.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.964

parnell. She's your way in.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.728
Under o'farrell's
old blind nose.

17:10.863 --> 17:14.665
- Noses aren't blind,
though mouths can smell.

17:14.801 --> 17:17.335
- Mouths can't smell.
They can taste.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.270
- You ever sniff
your own breath?

17:29.715 --> 17:31.749
- Do you have like...
Like any breath mints

17:31.884 --> 17:33.484

19:06.713 --> 19:09.380
- Jack nicholson.
Come on, the guy is a genius.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.114
- Hardly.
- Yeah!

19:11.151 --> 19:13.651
- No, come on. He has a lot of
charisma, a lot of like gaaah,

19:13.653 --> 19:16.187
But, you know, he plays
the same character all the time.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.389
Plus, why isn't she
the "viola davis"

19:18.391 --> 19:20.657

Now, if you told me

This is the meryl streep,
I would feel way more confident.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.734
- I know. I've been feeling,
like, really bad for you.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.336
Having to work with her
all the time, you must feel

19:32.405 --> 19:34.538

really useless.

19:36.642 --> 19:38.209

19:48.688 --> 19:51.154

that's him,

20:01.034 --> 20:03.033
But I've been around
long enough to know

20:03.102 --> 20:05.569

to be in charge of anything.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.705

20:51.017 --> 20:53.951
What's your name, dear?
- Kelly.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.219
- Why don't you follow me.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.893
- (nazir): There you go.
What did I tell you? Huh?

21:02.929 --> 21:04.995
It's why we call her
the nicholson.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.032
- So, kelly...

21:10.737 --> 21:12.436
...What do you want?

21:15.375 --> 21:16.974
I need a 96 beretta.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.244
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:20.379 --> 21:22.580
- Ok. Pat her down.
- Bag. Hands up. I'm gonna

21:22.715 --> 21:24.848
Pat you down real quick.
Thank you.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.119
What's a nice lady
like yourself

21:28.254 --> 21:30.388
Need a semi for, huh?

21:30.390 --> 21:32.022
- Who said I was nice?

21:34.093 --> 21:35.859
Ok.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.728
I need it to scare
my man, alright?

21:37.764 --> 21:41.132
He won't leave. I've been
with him for 10 years.

21:41.267 --> 21:43.367
- I was with my wife
for 50 years.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.035
- Yeah, but I bet
your wife was nice.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.738
- No. Fiona was a right bitch.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.740
- Did fiona put a 96 beretta

21:49.776 --> 21:51.475
On you when she wanted beer
from the fridge?

21:51.610 --> 21:55.012
- No. She wasn't that bad.
- Well, when I needed money

21:55.081 --> 21:57.414
For groceries,
a 96 beretta in my face.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.950
Home late?
A 96 beretta in my face.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.886
I tried to go to the cops,
but they're useless.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.155
- Yeah. Ain't that the truth.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.623
- Yeah, wayne, he don't like
cops much. Do you, wayne?
- I don't.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.559
- Well, this is
what you do.

22:08.694 --> 22:10.694
<i> We're gonna hold your ammo</i>
<i> as a deposit.</i>

22:10.763 --> 22:13.897
<i> Near 5 o'clock, show up</i>
<i> at this backdoor back here</i>

22:13.933 --> 22:16.633
With an extra grand
in your pocket for me,

22:16.669 --> 22:18.235
And then we can do this.

22:18.371 --> 22:21.671
Ok?
- Can I trust this guy?

22:22.775 --> 22:24.842
- Yeah, you can. I trust him

22:24.977 --> 22:27.445
More than my own son.
As a matter of fact, when I die,

22:27.447 --> 22:29.446
I'm gonna leave him the store.
Isn't that right, wayne?

22:29.482 --> 22:32.616
- I'll call it
wayne's dollarama.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.454
- Ok, thank you.
- No. Thank you.

22:42.428 --> 22:44.862
(satisfied sigh)

22:46.465 --> 22:49.933
- I'm the goddamn nicholson.
(chuckling)

22:56.642 --> 22:58.609
- I need to figure out
how close the cops are

22:58.678 --> 23:00.745
To busting the bowens.
They say anything to you?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.747
- No, they just asked me
what I knew.

23:05.485 --> 23:08.285
That wazowski one's got
a son she can't control

23:08.287 --> 23:10.621
Around your age.
Name's elliot, look him up.

23:12.358 --> 23:15.092
Maybe you make friends. Maybe
she talks to him. Who knows?

23:15.161 --> 23:17.161
- What the? I can't just
randomly make friends

23:17.230 --> 23:19.129
With somebody, mom.

23:24.470 --> 23:26.269
Unless you cough up some cash.

23:38.651 --> 23:41.318
Ok, come on, mom,
let's get real here.

23:41.320 --> 23:45.055
He's into clothing, right?
Like fashion, hmm?

23:46.192 --> 23:48.058
You want me to link up
with this guy or not?

23:53.332 --> 23:55.332
(suspenseful music)

24:29.502 --> 24:31.201
(indistinct police radio)

24:32.772 --> 24:36.173
- Detective tara swallows,
homicide. Who found the body?

24:36.175 --> 24:37.774
- That'd be me.

24:37.776 --> 24:39.710
- Chase, you wanna grab
the bio packages?

24:41.247 --> 24:44.114
You were looking to buy drugs?
- Guns.

24:44.116 --> 24:45.916
He wasn't selling drugs.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.784
Kelly duff.
We've met before.

24:47.854 --> 24:49.186
(mouthing)

24:49.188 --> 24:51.055
No? Ok.
- Detective tara swallows.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.789
This is detective
dustin chase, homicide.

24:52.791 --> 24:55.592
- Detective samantha wazowski,
guns and gangs. We've also

24:55.728 --> 24:58.361
Met before.
- Detective ty nazir.

24:58.397 --> 25:01.665
We too have met before.
(mouthing)

25:01.800 --> 25:05.469
- Ok. Um, kelly was helping us
out on a covert uc operation

25:05.604 --> 25:07.470
When she found the body.
- Was he dead

25:07.507 --> 25:09.206
When you got here?
Did you call an ambulance?

25:10.576 --> 25:14.077
- We're gonna have to ask you
to head back to the oce,

25:14.113 --> 25:16.813
Wait for us there. And we're
going to need to seize your gun.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.149
- Excuse me?
- Curious to know

25:19.151 --> 25:21.885
How your investigation may have
led to this guy's death.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.954
- I didn't have one on me.
I went undercover to buy--

25:24.023 --> 25:25.756
- Happy to cooperate
however we can.

25:25.758 --> 25:28.759
- Sounds like a random b&e.
- I don't know, might not be--

25:28.828 --> 25:31.495
- We'll get your statement
later. Now, we're gonna have
to ask you to vacate the scene.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.968
- Until we know
who's providing these guns,

25:38.103 --> 25:39.970
We might want to say
as little as possible

25:40.006 --> 25:43.106
About what we're doing.
- Swallows and chase,

25:43.142 --> 25:45.843
It's a cheap-ass porno
if I ever heard it.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.746
(distant siren blaring)

25:56.255 --> 25:58.722
(chuckling)

26:00.493 --> 26:02.025
(snorting)
hmm...

26:06.365 --> 26:09.066
You don't got
much of a life, huh?

26:09.201 --> 26:10.568
You just sit
around here all night?

26:10.703 --> 26:12.068
- I don't see you
going anywhere.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.874
Plus, my son probably has
friends over, and they
just really ignore me.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.642
- Oh. Just like
high school, huh?

26:18.678 --> 26:20.978
- Yeah. No.
- Oh!

26:21.113 --> 26:23.546
Good. Look,

26:23.583 --> 26:25.882
I was on my way
to the emergency vet with kevin

26:25.918 --> 26:29.285
When I get a call from homicide
saying that they've taken over
the dealz case,

26:29.322 --> 26:31.922
B&e gone wrong. Tell me
this isn't a dirty cop.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.491
- Oh. We don't know what it is,
but it's definitely not a b&e

26:34.560 --> 26:37.361
Because there was
no sign of forced entry.
And if it was a b&e,

26:37.363 --> 26:39.830
It's probably because
ed o'farrell is a gun dealer.

26:39.899 --> 26:42.966
- A gun dealer who
was apparently killed
by a .40-calibre bullet.

26:42.969 --> 26:45.235
- Oh, christ!
It's standard police round.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.638
- But it's also the same bullet
used in a 96 beretta,

26:47.707 --> 26:50.040
So... I live in hope.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.142
- Ok, I'll get ballistics
to call when they hear.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.710
- Yeah. And we'll pull in
wayne revenzo tomorrow.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.445
Maybe he got tired of waiting
to inherit the store

26:55.481 --> 26:57.781
And decided to
speed up the process.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.851
- No! Leave it. Officially,
homicide takes precedence,

27:00.853 --> 27:03.386
So stay low, stay quiet
and stay out of their way.

27:03.422 --> 27:07.124
I gotta get kevin to the vet.
You two, go home!

27:07.126 --> 27:10.127
Come here, bibi. Come here.
Let's go

27:10.196 --> 27:12.129
Take care of you.
Your tummy doesn't

27:12.264 --> 27:14.197
Feel good.
(door closing)

27:14.233 --> 27:16.166
- (swallows): I'm glad to tell
you that your father's death was

27:16.301 --> 27:18.736
Quick, though admittedly brutal.
- Any idea

27:18.738 --> 27:21.005
Who did this?
- We're still investigating,

27:21.140 --> 27:23.140
Mr. O'farrell, but it appears
to be a robbery

27:23.209 --> 27:26.343
Gone wrong.
- Hi.

27:26.478 --> 27:29.680
- Do the robbery ever go right?
- It can go a lot "righter"
than it did today.

27:29.682 --> 27:32.882
- It's actually "more right."
I mean, it's still an
awkward thing to say, but...

27:32.918 --> 27:34.718
- My dad owns a dollar store
for god's sake!

27:34.854 --> 27:36.954
- We need to ask him
of his dad's side business.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.289
- What is his side business?
- We can't say, it's part

27:39.291 --> 27:41.224
Of our covert operation,
but we will need

27:41.260 --> 27:43.493
A few minutes alone
with mr. O'farrell.

27:43.529 --> 27:45.829
- (swallows): I need your help.
- (o'farrell): Yeah. I'll do
whatever you need.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.497
- Are you gonna relay
that information or...?

27:47.533 --> 27:48.999
- No.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.101
- (o'farrell): Uh, someone stole

27:51.103 --> 27:54.571
A recycling bin, so...
(knocking on glass)

27:57.109 --> 27:58.642
- Sorry, where were we?

27:58.777 --> 28:01.011
- You're too soft.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.046
Watch me chase this.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.382
- (swallows): This is a matter--
(knocking)

28:05.517 --> 28:07.451
- Excuse me. Need a few minutes
to interview mr. O'farrell.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.853
In private.
- I'm detective tara swallows.

28:09.988 --> 28:11.922
I'm in the middle
of a homicide investigation.

28:12.057 --> 28:14.124
- Yeah, I know that. We've met.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.760
I just need a few minutes--
- I don't care what you need.

28:16.896 --> 28:19.596
I need you to leave, I need you
to respect my investigation,

28:19.665 --> 28:22.999
And I need you to turn around
and leave my interview.

28:23.001 --> 28:24.935
- Yeah, I respect.
I just need a few minutes--
- yeah. "I just, I just..."

28:24.937 --> 28:27.504
- Oh!
- Do I need to have

28:27.639 --> 28:29.473
A firm chat
with inspector schenks?

28:29.475 --> 28:31.475
- No, no.
- No? No.

28:31.477 --> 28:32.810
- No.
- No.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.478
- Yes.
- No.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.680
I didn't think so.
I didn't think so.

28:36.749 --> 28:38.749
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Why don't you just--

28:38.751 --> 28:41.084
- Can I just
ask him one question?
- Absolutely not. Not even one.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.220
Out.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.756
(buzzing and beeping)

28:45.891 --> 28:47.825
Now where we were?

28:47.960 --> 28:50.427
(beeping)
so this recycling bin,

28:50.562 --> 28:52.362
What dimensions are we talking?

28:52.431 --> 28:54.631
(kelly sighing)
- oh, it must have been

28:54.667 --> 28:56.599
Like really hard
to swallow.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.645
- Yo! Elliot!

29:08.647 --> 29:11.381
Come play, man.
She's not gonna show.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.317
- She is. I need
the money, yo.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.118
- You should just
mail her that crap.

29:15.154 --> 29:18.122
- It's not crap.
- I hope not.

29:19.492 --> 29:22.359
- Hey. Are you j?
- Yeah.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.128
Alright.
So this is

29:24.263 --> 29:27.131
Highland collegiate, eh?
- Yes, ma'am.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.266
- Where all the pretty girls go.

29:29.335 --> 29:32.202
- Well, not all of 'em.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.540
Here.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.143
- Ok. Alright.

29:43.716 --> 29:46.016
Alright, alright.
Two bills.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.284
- No, 250. I waited
in line all day.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.355
- Oh, ok, so you like
wasting time then?

29:51.357 --> 29:54.024
- Yeah. So you don't have to.

29:58.397 --> 29:59.630
Sweet.

30:03.235 --> 30:06.637
- Who designed that?
- It's... It's nothing.

30:06.639 --> 30:08.372
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.841
- Cool. Well...

30:16.115 --> 30:18.649
Now it's something.
(elliot chuckling)

30:25.825 --> 30:28.658
(siren blaring)

30:28.727 --> 30:30.593
(buzzing and beeping)

30:32.464 --> 30:33.931
- You?!

30:33.933 --> 30:37.267
You're a cop?!
- Surprise.

30:37.402 --> 30:39.536
The same one you made
a deal with for a 96 beretta,

30:39.538 --> 30:41.138
And I got it all on tape.

30:43.275 --> 30:45.608
- Fine. What? You... You...
You're gonna charge me?

30:45.644 --> 30:49.212
- Depends. What can
you tell me about ed?

30:49.215 --> 30:52.382
- What about him?
- He's dead.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.951
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.953
- I just saw him yesterday.
You were with me,

30:56.989 --> 30:59.289
What are you talking about?
- Yeah, well, we found his body

30:59.424 --> 31:01.958
In your shop at 5 p.M.
After you closed up

31:02.094 --> 31:04.460
And conveniently took off!

31:04.496 --> 31:07.030
- He's dead?
- He's dead.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.036
- Oh, my god.

31:15.507 --> 31:16.839
You're lying.

31:18.510 --> 31:21.644
Oh, my god! Oh!
- Ok, ok. Alright, alright.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.780
- Oh, my god!
(crying)

31:23.782 --> 31:25.449
- Alright, mr. Revenzo,
I'm sorry to have to do this,

31:25.584 --> 31:28.385
But, um... I need
to test your hand

31:28.454 --> 31:30.019
For gunshot residue.

31:32.358 --> 31:35.392
(sobbing)
<i> it wasn't wayne.</i>

31:35.461 --> 31:37.927
Gsr's clear,
and he has an alibi.

31:37.963 --> 31:40.030
- Schenks got the ballistic
report back from ed's murder.

31:40.165 --> 31:42.131
The bullet wasn't
from a police gun;

31:42.167 --> 31:44.601
It was from a 96 beretta that
was used in a drive-by in 2016,

31:44.736 --> 31:46.937
Confiscated by the cops.
Supposedly destroyed last year.

31:46.939 --> 31:48.939
Ok, so what are you looking for?
- Just seeing

31:49.008 --> 31:50.741
Where the guns get destroyed
once they've left the police.

31:50.876 --> 31:52.509
- Oh, it's empire steel
on hamilton.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.211
- That's a new contract.
Six months ago,

31:54.213 --> 31:57.480
It was eastern steel and year
before that, it was king city.

31:58.784 --> 32:00.484
- Oh, my god!
Ok, pull up...

32:00.486 --> 32:02.419
Pull up your bodycam footage.
Do it. From yesterday.

32:02.488 --> 32:05.022
The stuff from dealz.
It's the stuff from dealz!

32:05.024 --> 32:06.890
The stuff from dealz! Go into
network. Go into network.

32:06.892 --> 32:08.625
- We're networked.
- Press enter. Press enter.

32:08.760 --> 32:12.328
Go to... I'm just gonna do it.
- Go right ahead. Yeah, ok.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.633
-<i> Thank you.</i>
-<i> Wayne, keep an eye on him, ok?</i>

32:17.670 --> 32:19.402
-<i> Yeah, I got him.</i>

32:21.173 --> 32:23.539
-<i> Sayonara, you useless tit.</i>

32:24.910 --> 32:26.977
- Paul o'farrell:
Sad eyes, sweet face,

32:27.046 --> 32:28.911
You know, really not
unpleasant looking.

32:28.948 --> 32:30.847
- Jesus, woman,
how desperate are you?

32:30.916 --> 32:32.716
- Luckily for you I am very
desperate 'cause I "zazzed" him

32:32.718 --> 32:34.451
That pretty good look.
Look at his jacket.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.586
- Ohhh...

32:38.190 --> 32:39.589
Ahhh...

32:39.725 --> 32:42.458
So your boyfriend here
works for the same steel company

32:42.494 --> 32:44.127
Where the police sent
the confiscated weapons

32:44.262 --> 32:45.995
For meltdown.
- It wasn't a dirty cop.

32:46.031 --> 32:48.398
Ed was getting the guns
from his son.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.700
Ok, wait. You don't think
that paul killed his own dad?

32:52.571 --> 32:54.204
- I don't know.

32:56.274 --> 32:59.009
But you're gonna find out.
We'll cut wayne a deal,

32:59.144 --> 33:01.144
Have him call paul,
tell him that the beretta buyer

33:01.279 --> 33:03.613
Still wants to finish the deal.
You're gonna go in,

33:03.749 --> 33:05.882
Buy the gun from him, and maybe
we'll find our murder weapon.

33:05.884 --> 33:08.285
- Oh no. I'm not going
undercover. No, absolutely not.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.086
That's not my--
- I've been compromised, dummy.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.088
Paul saw me in the interview
room. He knows I'm a cop.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.923
- Yeah, but you're the streep.
You look really good.

33:13.959 --> 33:15.559
You're the streep.
I'm not the streep.

33:15.561 --> 33:16.893
- No. I'm the nicholson.

33:16.962 --> 33:19.229
You know, you're more
like the pamela anderson.

33:19.231 --> 33:22.698
But even pamela can get
the job done in a pinch.

33:22.735 --> 33:25.769
Tits up.
(kelly grunting)

33:25.771 --> 33:27.503
This'll be good.

33:28.741 --> 33:31.108
- Testing, testing, testing.

33:31.110 --> 33:34.043
Oh, hi. Yeah, I'm bianca.
What? No, I'm just...

33:34.079 --> 33:37.514
Oh, I'm bianca. What?
No, I'm... It's no big...

33:37.583 --> 33:39.116
My name is bianca.
- Wow.

33:39.251 --> 33:41.384

33:41.387 --> 33:43.253

how... How does it sound?

33:43.255 --> 33:45.088
- Fake as hell.
- Oh, yeah, yeah?

33:45.124 --> 33:48.257
- Look, I'ma say this
one time, ok?

33:48.293 --> 33:50.660
If you don't believe what's
coming out your own mouth,

33:50.662 --> 33:54.263
No one else is going to either.
Alright, just be yourself.

33:54.299 --> 33:56.266
Lean in to what's real.
- Oh yeah.

33:56.268 --> 33:58.034
Like len and the beretta
were real.

33:58.070 --> 34:00.303
- Yeah, actually, they were.

34:02.908 --> 34:04.740
- You had a boyfriend
point a gun in your face?

34:04.777 --> 34:07.477
(sighing)

34:07.612 --> 34:09.479
- Let's just say there was
enough truth in my story

34:09.481 --> 34:11.948
That the lie was bulletproof.

34:12.017 --> 34:15.017
Ok?
- Ok.

34:15.054 --> 34:17.621
- Here's the money.
Let's go.

34:27.699 --> 34:30.100
- (wayne):<i> Ok, he's not here.</i>
<i> He's late.</i>

34:30.169 --> 34:32.903
- I cannot wait to turn you
over to homicide because
they are gonna shred you.

34:33.038 --> 34:35.906
- I told him what you wanted.
He said that she was supposed
to pick it up yesterday.

34:36.041 --> 34:37.908
And I can't control
what he does. He said he was...

34:39.211 --> 34:40.911
- Hi. I'm samantha.
You must be paul.

34:41.046 --> 34:42.845
- Paul, uh,
I told you about

34:42.881 --> 34:46.049
Samantha. Um, I'll let
you guys go ahead

34:46.118 --> 34:48.185
And talk it out. You two, talk.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.120
- Hi.
- Yeah, if you don't mind,

34:50.122 --> 34:52.389
I'm just trying to gather
my father's effects.

34:52.524 --> 34:54.257
- Yeah.

34:54.326 --> 34:56.259
Listen...
Listen, I'm really sorry

34:56.394 --> 34:58.328
For your loss. I only met
your dad the other day,

34:58.330 --> 35:00.464
But he seems like a real...
Like a force.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.266

35:03.335 --> 35:05.268
Well, your dad promised
that he'd help me out,

35:05.304 --> 35:07.804
And I guess that's why I'm here
with the money.

35:15.380 --> 35:18.548
Hey. Wayne said
that you'd be cool.

35:18.617 --> 35:22.652
- You're too thirsty, waz.
You're too thirsty. Ease up.

35:27.526 --> 35:30.560
- I am offering you a decent
price for this particular item,

35:30.562 --> 35:32.896
And if you're not willing
to make me a deal,

35:32.898 --> 35:35.098
Then you're
a useless tit.

35:35.233 --> 35:37.734
I should be dealing
with wayne after all!
- What the hell did you call me?

35:37.736 --> 35:40.570
- Oh, snap.
Nice pull-up, waz.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.305
(grunting)

35:44.476 --> 35:47.577
- I called you
a useless tit.

35:47.712 --> 35:49.579
And you're clearly not
the brains of this operation,

35:49.615 --> 35:51.514
Which is obviously why
wayne's taken over.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.984
- You have no idea
who does what around here.

35:54.119 --> 35:55.952
- Yeah? And what do you do

35:55.954 --> 35:57.920
Except impale
potential customers on what?

35:57.956 --> 36:00.457
A bunch of kitten toys?
Why don't you get off me?!

36:02.327 --> 36:05.261
- What do you want exactly?
- A 96 beretta like your dad
promised me!

36:05.397 --> 36:07.730
- I don't have one!
-Yeah, well, that's the only one

36:07.766 --> 36:10.267
I know how to shoot because
that's the one my husband had

36:10.269 --> 36:12.535
And that's the one I learned on.
And now my husband's gone,

36:12.571 --> 36:15.472
So is the gun and so is my son.
And I'm alone and I hate it.

36:15.474 --> 36:18.341
Like, I really, really hate it.
But that is life,

36:18.410 --> 36:20.277
<i> Right?</i>

36:20.279 --> 36:22.012
<i> You work like a dog</i>

36:22.014 --> 36:23.613
<i> For your family,</i>
<i> and then what?</i>

36:25.150 --> 36:27.517
Because who says that that
family is gonna stick around.

36:29.154 --> 36:32.155
Because husbands leave
and kids grow up, and then what?

36:32.290 --> 36:34.691
You're left without hobbies
or friends or interests

36:34.693 --> 36:36.759
Except in the family
that just left and the job

36:36.828 --> 36:38.428
That you're eventually
gonna retire from.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.897
No, I don't want to be alone,
but if I have to be,

36:41.032 --> 36:43.032
Well, I need a gun
for protection,

36:43.101 --> 36:45.335
And I need a gun
that I am familiar with.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.145
- Everything I have
is in my car.

37:00.485 --> 37:02.986
(nazir exhaling)

37:02.988 --> 37:04.788
- Let's go.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.533
- Got the money?

37:17.569 --> 37:21.170
- Here. You can count
if you like.

37:21.206 --> 37:22.439
- Something's off here.

37:24.342 --> 37:27.210
How did you know that I wasn't
getting the store from my dad?

37:27.345 --> 37:29.378
- What?

37:29.414 --> 37:31.781
- Yeah. And inside, remember,
you said you knew

37:31.916 --> 37:35.051
That wayne was taking over.
How did you know?

37:36.555 --> 37:37.921
- Your dad told me.

37:41.693 --> 37:42.826
- Really?

37:47.633 --> 37:49.699
Huh!
(cocking the gun)

37:51.369 --> 37:53.169
In a business meeting
about guns,

37:53.238 --> 37:55.304
My son-of-a-bitch father
told you that he was giving

37:55.340 --> 37:57.307
The store to wayne? 'cause
he only told me yesterday.

37:57.376 --> 38:00.243
- Hey, I get it. I mean,
if my dad was giving away

38:00.378 --> 38:03.179
My inheritance to some loser,
I would be like way pissed.

38:03.181 --> 38:05.248
- You're wired? Trying to get
a confession or something?

38:05.383 --> 38:07.050
- Nah. I think I'm just gonna
leave that to homicide.

38:07.185 --> 38:09.185
Because you see, paul,
you might have one gun on me,

38:09.254 --> 38:10.754
But there are two on you.
- What?

38:12.257 --> 38:15.325
- I said, "you might have
one gun on me, but two on you!"

38:15.460 --> 38:18.127
- (duff): Police!
(grunting)

38:18.196 --> 38:20.597
- Ugh! Aaargh!

38:20.732 --> 38:23.333
- Stay down.
- Paul o'farrell,

38:23.468 --> 38:26.869
You are under arrest
for selling illegal weapons.

38:26.905 --> 38:28.805
I am pretty sure
this is the same gun

38:28.874 --> 38:30.874
That you used to kill
your father with.

38:30.876 --> 38:33.743
We're just gonna let ballistics
be the judge of that!

38:33.745 --> 38:35.412
- I got him.
Come on!

38:37.482 --> 38:39.883
- Ok, ok.
The streep, not bad.

38:39.885 --> 38:42.485

like the daniel day lewis

38:42.487 --> 38:45.020

like the daniel double d lewis!

38:45.057 --> 38:46.289

38:46.291 --> 38:47.957

- Did you see that?!

38:47.959 --> 38:50.160

but this moment, this moment...

38:50.295 --> 38:52.562
