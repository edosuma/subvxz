To give you some context,
I grew up without

08:45.917 --> 08:49.250
a real father figure, so you can
imagine what that meant to me.

08:49.333 --> 08:51.000
He's not like us.
He was born in an ivory tower.

08:51.083 --> 08:52.709

At least we don't
have to get into

15:51.834 --> 15:53.208
a back and forth
about location.

15:53.291 --> 15:56.000
Let me just get
some pictures of your face

15:56.083 --> 15:57.792
so the doctors
can reconstruct it.

15:57.875 --> 15:59.250
There you go.

16:00.667 --> 16:03.041
Beat it!

16:03.125 --> 16:05.250
Oh, this is gonna get ugly.
You gonna take a video of this?

16:05.333 --> 16:06.625
Definitely. I deleted a bunch
of pictures of my nephew

16:06.709 --> 16:08.041
to make room for it.

16:09.959 --> 16:11.166
Well, well, well.

16:11.250 --> 16:12.750
Glad you decided
to step outside.

16:12.834 --> 16:14.166
Makes it easier to clean up

16:14.250 --> 16:15.583
the mess I'm about to make.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.125
Unless you're ready
to apologize.

16:17.208 --> 16:18.500
No, I'm not going to apologize

16:18.583 --> 16:19.834
to a misogynist bully.

16:20.709 --> 16:22.583
That's you.

16:25.875 --> 16:27.000
Hey, you're gonna have
to get past Hot Gandhi,

16:27.083 --> 16:28.083
you want to get to my boy.

16:31.417 --> 16:32.625
Oh, you're good.

16:32.709 --> 16:35.583
I-I can't help you, I'm sorry.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.166
Kelly's a good kisser,
isn't she?

16:37.250 --> 16:38.959
Yeah. Best I ever had.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.917
And I've had five.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.500
(grunts)

16:42.583 --> 16:44.041
Remember what
I told you: stay loose

16:44.125 --> 16:46.875
and lose consciousness
as fast as possible.

16:46.959 --> 16:49.166
Yah!
What are you doing?

16:49.250 --> 16:51.041
I'm doing pretty good... Ah!

16:51.125 --> 16:52.417
Don't touch my girl.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.500
Don't touch my son.

16:54.583 --> 16:55.500
Dad, what are you doing?

16:55.583 --> 16:57.375
Just one second.

16:57.458 --> 16:59.041
Gerald, having a father
to egg you on

16:59.125 --> 17:00.500
to get in a fight is not
something you missed out on.

17:00.583 --> 17:02.000
Trust me, I know.

17:02.083 --> 17:03.625
Guys...
I asked for
a second.

17:03.709 --> 17:05.875
Okay.

17:05.959 --> 17:08.041
because you developed an app
or you fought a guy.

17:08.125 --> 17:10.625
I'm proud of you
because you're good.

17:10.709 --> 17:12.417
And you're kind.

17:12.500 --> 17:13.709
And I like to think

17:13.792 --> 17:15.291
that if I was around earlier

17:15.375 --> 17:17.041
that I would've raised you
to be that kind of man.

17:17.125 --> 17:19.041
Hey, guys! I'm on my
lunch break. Seriously?

17:19.125 --> 17:20.250
Bup-bup-bup!
Bup-bup-bup!
Listen, Dad,

17:20.333 --> 17:22.250
I know that's how
you would've raised me.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.875
I just wish you'd been at my
little race car derby thing.

17:24.959 --> 17:26.542
You would've been proud.
I came in fifth.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.083
Yeah?
Eighth.

17:28.166 --> 17:30.250
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss...

17:30.333 --> 17:32.625
What? You guys are so into
each other, go ahead and do it.

17:32.709 --> 17:34.834
You ready?
Yeah.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.583
Okay.
Here we go.

17:42.875 --> 17:44.125
(grunting)

17:44.208 --> 17:45.291
I'm going in!

17:45.375 --> 17:47.000
Come on, Dad!

17:48.166 --> 17:50.500
(grunting)

17:50.583 --> 17:52.333
Ah, you jerk!

17:52.417 --> 17:53.625
You're a jerk!

17:53.709 --> 17:55.291
Ow!

17:55.375 --> 17:56.625
Eh.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.208
Nobody's gonna watch this.

17:58.291 --> 18:00.166
Delete.

18:00.250 --> 18:01.834
(grunting)

18:01.917 --> 18:03.125
Ow, my car keys!

18:03.208 --> 18:05.250
♪ ♪

18:05.333 --> 18:07.750
Hey, I'm taking off,

18:07.834 --> 18:09.625
but I didn't want to leave
things weird between us.

18:09.709 --> 18:10.959
Is Abuela okay?

18:11.041 --> 18:12.166
Yeah, yeah. She calmed down.

18:12.250 --> 18:14.041
Like, we just had to light
a couple candles

18:14.125 --> 18:15.792
and split open a coconut
and ask it a question.

18:15.875 --> 18:17.083
(laughs)

18:17.166 --> 18:18.125
Oh, you're not kidding.

18:18.208 --> 18:19.125
Listen,
I'm sorry

18:19.208 --> 18:20.375
I snapped before.

18:20.458 --> 18:22.125
Oh, no, I totally understand.

18:22.208 --> 18:23.542
And I know how busy you are

18:23.625 --> 18:25.125
and, obviously,
Abuela's a handful.

18:25.208 --> 18:27.125
(phone buzzing)

18:27.208 --> 18:28.792
I got to make seven more
sales calls before 5:00.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.625
Just one sec.

18:30.709 --> 18:32.542
Hey, Mrs. Reeser.
The LA Phil

18:32.625 --> 18:34.875
is making a special package deal
for season tickets.

18:34.959 --> 18:36.417
Oh, you should go.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.208
Live. Go live your life.
I'm gonna finish painting.

18:38.291 --> 18:39.959
Oh, so you're
not sold yet, huh?

18:40.041 --> 18:42.291
What if I told you
that Beethoven himself

18:42.375 --> 18:43.625
is making an appearance?

18:43.709 --> 18:45.166
Oh. Okay...

18:45.250 --> 18:46.875
She hung up.
Vanessa...

18:46.959 --> 18:48.792
the arrow from the computer
disappears again.

18:48.875 --> 18:51.125
And my Santeria beads
are tangled.

18:51.208 --> 18:52.166
VANESSA:
Okay, it's okay,
I got it.

18:52.250 --> 18:54.125
(sniffs)
What is that smell?

18:54.208 --> 18:55.291
Oh, we need to change
your diaper.

18:55.375 --> 18:56.542
Oh! The doorbell.

18:56.625 --> 18:58.083
Don't use the hose!

18:58.166 --> 18:59.458
We're gonna
change your diaper.

18:59.542 --> 19:01.166
What?

19:02.834 --> 19:04.375
My life's not that busy.

19:04.458 --> 19:05.792
I've got a couple
of annoying clients,

19:05.875 --> 19:07.125
a pair of pants

19:07.208 --> 19:08.166
I know I'm gonna keep

19:08.250 --> 19:09.959
and a wine stain--
which, by now,

19:10.041 --> 19:11.375
face it, is probably permanent.

19:11.458 --> 19:14.583
But you are incredible.

19:14.667 --> 19:16.667
Go deal with the 8,000 things
you have to do.

19:16.750 --> 19:18.333
I will stay
and paint Edie's nursery.

19:18.417 --> 19:19.792
Oh... Really, Sara?
Yes.

19:19.875 --> 19:21.709
Thank you.
You are a lifesaver.

19:21.792 --> 19:23.750
Oh! No pressure.
I got Edie a new bed.

19:23.834 --> 19:25.166
Could you put a bowl of water

19:25.250 --> 19:27.208
under it for the spirits?

19:27.291 --> 19:28.792
The bed's in a box, so you're
gonna have to assemble it first.

19:28.875 --> 19:31.000
Thanks. You really are dope.

19:32.875 --> 19:35.291
I am dope.

19:39.291 --> 19:41.291
Ah...

19:43.375 --> 19:46.208
SARA:
How do you still look good
with a black eye?

19:46.291 --> 19:47.291
It's not fair.

19:47.375 --> 19:48.750
Ah, you know what they say.

19:48.834 --> 19:50.792
A dented Porsche
is still a Porsche. Right?

19:50.875 --> 19:52.291
Right.
Yeah.

19:52.375 --> 19:54.500
Hey, I didn't know
your dad was such a beast.

19:54.583 --> 19:57.208
Must be where I get
my uppercut from.

19:57.291 --> 19:59.000
That was a jab. Sort of.

19:59.083 --> 20:00.750
Well, he's a complicated guy.
You'll meet him.

20:00.834 --> 20:02.208
Oh, he loves me.

20:02.291 --> 20:04.500
Especially after
a glass of wine.
Oh, yeah.

20:04.583 --> 20:06.208
All right.
Let's get into this interview.

20:06.291 --> 20:08.208
"What is your favorite pasta?"

20:08.291 --> 20:09.417
"Tagliatelle."

20:09.500 --> 20:10.250
Boom.

20:10.333 --> 20:11.834
Classy.

20:11.917 --> 20:14.041
"What do you like to do for fun
on a Saturday night?"

20:14.125 --> 20:17.208
"If I told you, I'd have to kill
you. (raises eyebrow)"?

20:17.291 --> 20:19.625
Right? I-I riffed that
right on the spot.

20:19.709 --> 20:21.875
Let's just look
at the cover again, shall we?

20:21.959 --> 20:23.250
What do we think?

20:23.333 --> 20:24.417
Looks sexy.
Not bad.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.417
Let me show my granddaughter.

20:25.500 --> 20:26.959
Look at this.

20:27.041 --> 20:28.959
Is that handsome?

20:30.333 --> 20:31.250
<i>Time to go.</i>
