Thanks, Alex.

06:56.166 --> 06:56.615
What?
Huh?

06:56.617 --> 06:58.467
It won't do any good finding
the pigs if they escape again.

06:58.468 --> 07:00.318
What?
Huh?

07:00.320 --> 07:01.720

Come back, Cornelius!

09:24.697 --> 09:26.030
See? Hey, stay!

09:26.033 --> 09:26.498
That didn't really work.

09:26.499 --> 09:26.964
See? Hey, stay!

09:26.967 --> 09:29.084
It was a great try, Alex.
Now let's go get those pigs.

09:29.085 --> 09:31.202

all right!

09:48.421 --> 09:49.887

We need the PAW Patrol.

09:50.607 --> 09:51.323
See? Hey, stay!

09:51.325 --> 09:52.658
The rest of the PAW Patrol
are sick.

09:52.659 --> 09:53.992
See? Hey, stay!

09:53.994 --> 09:54.626
Then it's up to us.

09:54.627 --> 09:55.259
See? Hey, stay!

09:55.262 --> 09:57.279
No pig is too slippery!
No Alex is too small!

(Panting)

09:59.749 --> 10:00.198
See? Hey, stay!

10:00.200 --> 10:01.266
At least we got 'em
away from the creek.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.333
See? Hey, stay!

10:02.336 --> 10:03.318
Usually, once they're hungry,
they head back to the barn.

10:03.319 --> 10:04.301
See? Hey, stay!

10:04.304 --> 10:06.905
Hmm, maybe we can hurry them up
with a little treat.

10:06.906 --> 10:09.507
See? Hey, stay!

10:09.509 --> 10:11.643
Great idea, Ryder. I'm on it!

Hey, hey, wait!

10:29.295 --> 10:30.328
door.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.730
Those pigs are making
pigs of themselves!

10:31.731 --> 10:33.131
door.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.516
They don't know when to stop!

10:34.517 --> 10:35.900

10:35.902 --> 10:37.636
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

10:37.637 --> 10:39.371

what a day.

10:45.946 --> 10:46.878
Don't worry.
Rubble knows what to do.

10:46.879 --> 10:47.811
door.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.165
Maybe way for the
pig out express! All aboard!

10:50.166 --> 10:52.517

10:52.519 --> 10:53.819

10:53.820 --> 10:55.120
door.

10:58.925 --> 10:59.858
(Beeping)

10:59.860 --> 11:01.543
Rubble, I think you got a future
as a pig farmer.

11:01.544 --> 11:03.227
(Beeping)

11:03.230 --> 11:04.763
No way,
I'm sticking to construction.

11:04.764 --> 11:06.297
(Beeping)

11:06.299 --> 11:07.265
Pigs are too much work.

11:07.266 --> 11:08.232
(Beeping)

11:08.235 --> 11:09.234
Let me bulldoze up
the rest of the corn

11:09.235 --> 11:10.234
(Beeping)

11:10.237 --> 11:11.586
before the pigs
try to escape again.

11:11.587 --> 11:12.936
(Beeping)

11:12.939 --> 11:13.538
Thanks, Rubble!

11:19.362 --> 11:20.245
(Beeping)

11:20.247 --> 11:21.913
Just yelp for help!

11:21.914 --> 11:23.580

Me too.

11:33.660 --> 11:34.159
(Beeping)

11:34.161 --> 11:37.095
Pups, tuck your head. And the
cold won't spread, like this.

We do!

12:05.942 --> 12:06.958
(Banging)

12:06.960 --> 12:08.627
Appreciate you pups
pitching in on the fix-up.

12:08.628 --> 12:10.295
(Banging)

12:10.297 --> 12:11.697
This must have been
a cool old mining cabin.

12:11.698 --> 12:13.098
(Banging)

12:13.100 --> 12:16.051
Yep, and once we fix it up,
it'll be a cool old ski cabin.

12:16.052 --> 12:19.003
(Banging)

12:19.005 --> 12:19.754
Great! Now let's eat.

Oops!

Hey, where'd the rest
of my spilled lunch go?

12:39.809 --> 12:41.593
Oops!

12:41.595 --> 12:44.262
They did say that old ghost
was a big eater.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.930
Oops!

12:46.933 --> 12:47.298
"Ghost"?
"Ghost"?

12:47.299 --> 12:47.664
Oops!

12:47.667 --> 12:48.333
The old mining legends claim

12:48.334 --> 12:49.000
Oops!

12:49.002 --> 12:50.035
the cabin is haunted
by a hungry ghost.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.069
Oops!

12:51.071 --> 12:53.538
I don't know about ghosts.
But I'm pretty hungry right now.

12:53.539 --> 12:56.006
Oops!

12:56.009 --> 12:56.758
Well, you can't work on
an empty stomach, Rubble.

12:56.759 --> 12:57.508
Oops!

12:57.511 --> 12:59.311
Why don't you go get lunch?
And we'll finish up later.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.112
Oops!

13:01.114 --> 13:01.563
Awesome!

13:01.564 --> 13:02.013

See you!

13:05.434 --> 13:06.416
Oops!

13:10.957 --> 13:15.126
Hard work deserves a little nap.

13:15.128 --> 13:15.844
(Snoring)

13:15.845 --> 13:16.561
Hard work deserves a little nap.

13:19.399 --> 13:25.136
Huh? What? My lunchbox!

13:26.573 --> 13:30.275
Ghost! I got to call Ryder!

13:31.311 --> 13:33.478
Mmm!

13:33.480 --> 13:34.980
I love the taste
of air meatballs.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.481
Mmm!

13:36.483 --> 13:37.299
Great snag, Zuma.

13:37.300 --> 13:38.116

An emergency with a ghost?
We'll be right there.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.396

The cabin is pretty old.

17:32.151 --> 17:33.818
(Tires screeching)

17:33.820 --> 17:35.386
Ghost! Look!

Oh, hi, Ryder.

17:39.341 --> 17:39.823
(Tires screeching)

17:39.826 --> 17:40.892
Hi, pups. It's just me.

17:40.893 --> 17:41.959
(Tires screeching)

17:41.961 --> 17:42.226
Ah!

17:42.227 --> 17:42.492
(Tires screeching)

17:42.495 --> 17:42.994
I was hiding from the ghost

17:42.995 --> 17:43.494
(Tires screeching)

17:43.496 --> 17:44.963
underneath this drop cloth
when I heard a crash.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.431
(Tires screeching)

17:46.433 --> 17:46.748
(Sighing)

17:46.749 --> 17:47.064
(Tires screeching)

17:47.067 --> 17:48.283
Okay, pups,
let's shore up this porch.

17:48.284 --> 17:49.500
(Tires screeching)

17:49.502 --> 17:50.918
Rocky, see if you can find
something in your truck

17:50.919 --> 17:52.335
(Tires screeching)

17:52.338 --> 17:52.870
to make a post.

17:58.378 --> 17:58.843
Don't lose it. Reuse it.

17:58.844 --> 17:59.309
(Tires screeching)

17:59.312 --> 18:01.579
I'll nail these old table legs
together. It'll be perfect.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.847

18:09.289 --> 18:09.854
Great.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.105
Now, Rubble, lift the porch roof
with your crane.

Rubble on the double.

18:13.058 --> 18:13.757
Great.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.743
Jake and I can hold the post
while Rocky nails it in.

18:15.744 --> 18:17.727
Great.

18:17.730 --> 18:18.546
No problemo.

18:18.547 --> 18:19.363
