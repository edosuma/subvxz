00:41.034 --> 00:43.117
Come on!

00:52.617 --> 00:56.201
- Yeah... yeah!
- Come on!

01:08.159 --> 01:11.784
Let's try and do this nice and easy,
without any blood.

01:11.992 --> 01:14.159
Like a cobra, huh?

01:15.076 --> 01:16.701
And if we can't?

01:16.951 --> 01:19.284
I said we can try, Andreas.

01:20.659 --> 01:25.284
Here in America, there's always
some smartass who tries to be a hero.

01:25.492 --> 01:29.492
We'll soon be out of America.
We'll have money to build my new plant.

01:29.701 --> 01:32.909
We've got a great future together.
Don't blow it.

01:46.325 --> 01:49.366
Hey, Sean. When's your dad coming on?

01:49.616 --> 01:52.658
One more fight
and they'll start the main event.

01:52.866 --> 01:54.866
Where's Sean?

01:55.075 --> 01:59.366
I don't know. This kid's never around
when you want him.

02:07.366 --> 02:08.991
Come on!

02:11.825 --> 02:15.575
Yo, work this shoulder.

02:17.991 --> 02:20.033
Now breathe.

02:22.825 --> 02:25.075
Go, go! Go!

02:25.325 --> 02:28.408
- Hey, Sean! Sean, where you going?
- I'll be right back.

02:28.658 --> 02:32.908
- Wait! I'll come with you.
- No. I'll be back before the next.

02:51.115 --> 02:51.865
Go.

03:32.324 --> 03:34.574
Use the crowd noise to cover our move.

03:52.198 --> 03:56.239
- Get up! Get up against the wall!
- If they move, kill them.

04:14.448 --> 04:16.156
- Come here, boy.
- Sean!

04:16.406 --> 04:19.156
- Stand back!
- Don't shoot my son!

04:19.447 --> 04:20.781
No!

04:21.738 --> 04:24.114
- Sean, look out!
- Dad!

04:34.031 --> 04:35.364
Dad...

04:38.364 --> 04:41.198
Help him, Izumo. Help him!

04:47.073 --> 04:50.573
I'm bleeding. The little brat bit me!

04:55.114 --> 04:58.863
<i>- Izumo? Is he...?
- I'm afraid he is.</i>

05:10.613 --> 05:15.905
Sean, in the last months you have
proven yourself a worthy student.

05:16.072 --> 05:18.238
Thank you, Master.

05:19.988 --> 05:23.197
Now it is time to continue your training

05:23.613 --> 05:27.655
<i>in the art of Mikkyo, the secret doctrine.</i>

05:28.530 --> 05:30.697
First position.

05:33.447 --> 05:35.697
Second position.

05:37.155 --> 05:39.030
Third position.

05:40.572 --> 05:43.072
Fourth position.

05:43.155 --> 05:45.488
Fifth position.

05:47.113 --> 05:49.738
Very good, Sean. First position.

05:49.947 --> 05:52.405
First strike. Second position.

05:53.697 --> 05:55.780
Third position.

05:55.905 --> 05:57.947
Angle the sword down.

05:58.113 --> 06:00.321
Fourth position.

06:00.571 --> 06:03.779
Fifth position. Well done, Sean.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.946
<i>That's OK.</i>

06:14.696 --> 06:17.071
Four, five.

06:17.321 --> 06:19.321
One, two.

06:20.696 --> 06:23.362
- One, two...
- Ow!

06:26.737 --> 06:29.987
<i>Your body is merely
the vehicle of your soul.</i>

06:30.196 --> 06:34.821
<i>Ultimate physical power can be achieved
only by way of spiritual power.</i>

06:35.071 --> 06:39.487
<i>Your mind and soul over your body.
Remember that, Sean.</i>

06:39.696 --> 06:42.446
<i>Mind and soul over your body.</i>

06:45.279 --> 06:46.862
Sean?

06:47.154 --> 06:49.737
Do you remember the first technique?

06:49.862 --> 06:52.071
It's been a long time.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.071
<i>Hai!</i>

07:20.028 --> 07:24.320
<i>We have overcome your tragedy
and turned it into opportunity.</i>

07:24.528 --> 07:28.653
<i>My doubts and fears of bringing you here
are at rest.</i>

07:28.945 --> 07:32.986
<i>Your ability shows that
a greater destiny awaits you.</i>

07:40.278 --> 07:44.320
<i>Now you must seek out this destiny alone.</i>

07:44.486 --> 07:47.820
<i>Your training is at last complete, Sean.</i>

07:48.028 --> 07:50.361
<i>Now you are a ninja.</i>

08:16.527 --> 08:18.735
Gentlemen, may I have your attention?

08:19.069 --> 08:21.819
Thank you for coming. Please be seated.

08:21.985 --> 08:25.110
Today is really a great day.

08:25.319 --> 08:28.694
This project has been
over ten years in research.

08:28.944 --> 08:33.818
But I'm glad that I can tell you that there
will be no more inefficient hijackings.

08:34.152 --> 08:38.443
No more bungled kidnappings
or mistimed bombings.

08:40.277 --> 08:45.819
Now terrorism can be scientifically
focused to be totally effective.

08:45.944 --> 08:48.985
It all sounds quite impressive, Doctor.

08:49.277 --> 08:52.569
But until you prove its ability
to defeat any human -

08:52.777 --> 08:57.777
or should I say even the strongest
human? - they're not buying.

08:58.027 --> 09:03.235
Very good, General Andreas. That's
a good challenge. I'll accept it, too.

09:03.527 --> 09:08.444
We'll find a superhuman and show you
the power of our new experiment.

09:08.569 --> 09:11.943
We'd be ready to strike within a month,
if not sooner.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.984
Things seem to be going nicely.

09:31.151 --> 09:35.901
Except for General Andreas. I don't know
how you tolerate his incessant demands.

09:36.026 --> 09:39.109
His dissatisfaction
can work to our advantage.

09:39.318 --> 09:41.931
Until he's outlived his
usefulness, let him

09:41.944 --> 09:44.568
think he runs the island.
It doesn't matter.

09:46.818 --> 09:49.568
<i>Air Triana announces
the departure of its flight...</i>

09:49.668 --> 09:53.276
Excuse me. You're Sean Davidson, right?

09:53.401 --> 09:54.984
Yeah.

09:55.234 --> 09:59.151
- Curtis. Curtis Jackson!
- That's right.

09:59.318 --> 10:02.734
- Good to see you again, man.
- Good to see you.

10:02.901 --> 10:07.276
- Fighting lightweight?
- I'm just gonna do the sword competition.

10:07.526 --> 10:12.193
<i>Excuse me. Sorry. You made the cover
of Inside Karate this month.</i>

10:12.359 --> 10:15.068
- Dex.
- Hi, Dex. Sean Davidson.

10:15.276 --> 10:18.608
Good to meet you, man.
It's a pleasure. It really is.

10:21.067 --> 10:23.483
<i>- Hey, this is Curtis Jackson.
- Dex.</i>

10:23.650 --> 10:27.900
- Of course. The sword man.
- That's right.

10:28.108 --> 10:32.275
<i>Boy. The English look, uh...
very pale, wouldn't you say?</i>

10:33.817 --> 10:37.400
That's Joe Simpson there. He's tough.

10:37.650 --> 10:40.400
I see Tom Wright from Australia's
here also.

10:40.650 --> 10:45.900
<i>I ain't worried. I mean, uh...
we're Americans, right?</i>

10:46.108 --> 10:49.233
- This your first time?
- Yeah.

10:49.442 --> 10:52.442
<i>- Come on.
- ... please board immediately.</i>

11:10.067 --> 11:13.192
<i>Triana Island Air
is pleased to announce</i>

11:13.442 --> 11:17.525
<i>the flight from the mainland
has now arrived at Gate 3.</i>

11:37.774 --> 11:38.566
Oh.

11:46.316 --> 11:49.566
- Well, they've all arrived.
- Great. Please, sit down.

11:50.899 --> 11:53.274
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

11:53.524 --> 11:57.691
Arranging that tournament was actually
a fabulous idea. Really fabulous.

11:58.024 --> 12:00.441
Well, only if the right one is here.

12:00.566 --> 12:04.274
Remember, General Andreas
asked for a superhuman.

12:04.441 --> 12:07.191
Yes. That is the question.

12:09.274 --> 12:14.482
I saw the American team at the airport.
I think the guy we're after is one of them.

12:14.524 --> 12:16.357
Really?

12:17.857 --> 12:23.149
Very good. Watch the tournament.
If you think he's the one, let me know.

12:23.274 --> 12:25.356
- Absolutely. I will.
- Thank you.

12:25.648 --> 12:27.606
<i>Welcome to the opening</i>

12:27.815 --> 12:32.815
of the 1989 Island Games
International Karate Championship.

12:33.023 --> 12:36.606
East Bay Labs is proud
to sponsor these games.

12:36.773 --> 12:38.440
As their representative,

12:38.648 --> 12:44.273
I would now like to introduce
the honorary host of this marvelous event,

12:44.481 --> 12:48.523
the distinguished leader of Triana,
General Andreas.

12:59.315 --> 13:00.690
Thank you.

13:00.898 --> 13:03.815
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:04.023 --> 13:10.106
over the next few days you will see
the battles of modern-day warriors,

13:10.356 --> 13:14.940
courageous men
who will prove their strength and skills

13:15.190 --> 13:18.190
in the spirit of international competition.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.773
Let the games begin.

13:43.355 --> 13:47.522
<i>And now, from America,
Sean Davidson,</i>

13:47.730 --> 13:50.522
<i>three times black belt karate champion.</i>

13:53.730 --> 13:56.980
<i>And his opponent, from Great Britain,</i>

13:57.230 --> 14:00.855
<i>the European karate champion,
Joe Simpson.</i>

14:10.564 --> 14:15.564
<i>Sean Davidson is on the white line
and Joe Simpson is on the red line.</i>

14:15.689 --> 14:19.022
Gentlemen, here. Bow.

14:19.230 --> 14:22.605
To each other, bow. Fighting stance.

14:26.230 --> 14:30.939
<i>Sean Davidson appears to be taunting
Joe Simpson by remaining still.</i>

14:40.104 --> 14:45.229
<i>Good blocks and quick reactions from
Davidson has averted any contact hits.</i>

14:45.438 --> 14:47.021
Continue.

14:53.896 --> 14:57.021
<i>A nice combination by Davidson
gives him a first point.</i>

14:58.563 --> 14:59.938
Ready?

15:06.021 --> 15:09.979
<i>A solid hit by Simpson ties the match.</i>

15:10.104 --> 15:13.313
<i>Whoever gets the next point
will be the winner.</i>

15:28.313 --> 15:29.646
No point.

15:29.813 --> 15:35.728
<i>Despite Davidson's contact hit, it was
a no point. Simpson was out of bounds.</i>

15:35.937 --> 15:37.770
<i>Continue.</i>

15:46.353 --> 15:49.478
Strike point. Winner.

15:49.645 --> 15:52.978
<i>Sean Davidson wasn't going
to leave anything to chance.</i>

15:53.187 --> 15:56.812
<i>He defeated Simpson
with a fast kick to win the match.</i>

15:58.312 --> 16:04.103
Wow, would you look at those two!
I'm gonna get us a table with them, OK?

16:04.395 --> 16:07.312
If he introduces me again
as the karate champion...

16:07.562 --> 16:10.645
- May we join you, my friends and I?
- Yeah.

16:10.937 --> 16:13.270
Guys, come on over for a beer.

16:13.437 --> 16:16.728
Let me introduce you. My buddy Sean.

16:16.978 --> 16:20.312
- Hi.
- Karate champion.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.603
Hi, I'm Susanna.

16:22.812 --> 16:26.770
And this is Powerhouse Jackson.
Oh, Powerhouse!

16:28.312 --> 16:30.728
- Nice to meet you.
- Powerhouse.

16:30.937 --> 16:35.520
I'm Dex.
Kind of the... heartthrob of the group.

16:35.812 --> 16:39.519
- Your best one yet!
- Can we have three beers, please?

16:39.686 --> 16:43.019
- No. Make mine a Coke, if you will.
- Make that two.

16:43.227 --> 16:47.269
<i>- Are you with the tournament?
- We represent the United States.</i>

16:49.602 --> 16:51.852
- Who do you represent?
- Myself.

16:52.061 --> 16:55.852
Yourself? I'm very glad.
Perhaps there is a God.

16:56.019 --> 16:59.227
Thank you. You're very charming.

17:00.977 --> 17:02.727
<i>Hey, Sean, what's up?</i>

17:06.602 --> 17:09.227
Can you keep up with him? OK.

17:09.435 --> 17:10.227
Go.

17:51.476 --> 17:55.810
Hey. An oriental man, older guy,
and a couple of other guys. What room?

17:56.476 --> 17:59.226
<i>What room?</i>

18:02.935 --> 18:05.518
Upstairs on the right.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.475
Izumo.

19:09.434 --> 19:10.809
Sean.

19:13.517 --> 19:14.975
It's you.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.434
Izumo, what's going on?

19:17.642 --> 19:21.475
What are you doing here?
Who are those people?

20:13.974 --> 20:16.058
<i>Sean! Help me!</i>

20:19.391 --> 20:20.724
Sean!

20:23.849 --> 20:25.391
Sean!

20:40.516 --> 20:42.433
Help, Sean!

21:49.848 --> 21:52.098
<i>Sean!</i>

22:02.972 --> 22:04.931
This way, Sean!

22:21.889 --> 22:23.264
Izumo!

22:45.014 --> 22:46.681
What the hell?

23:59.138 --> 24:02.305
This comb has history. Yeah, it's...

24:17.470 --> 24:19.137
Jackson! Jackson.

24:19.429 --> 24:22.220
- I've got to talk to you.
- Sure. Excuse me.

24:22.429 --> 24:25.012
- Come here, man.
- Yeah. How you doin'?

24:25.262 --> 24:27.220
- Later, girls!
- What happened to you?

24:27.470 --> 24:29.054
I'm not sure.

24:29.304 --> 24:31.095
You're a mess.

24:31.304 --> 24:32.845
Look...

24:35.345 --> 24:38.679
I have a master, Izumo.

24:39.804 --> 24:43.887
He raised me since my father's killing

24:44.095 --> 24:46.220
in the way of ninja.

24:46.387 --> 24:48.887
- You're a ninja?
- Yes.

24:49.220 --> 24:51.512
So that explains a few things.

24:52.554 --> 24:55.637
I saw Izumo here.

24:55.845 --> 24:59.304
He was being kidnapped by the ninja.

24:59.512 --> 25:02.220
The ninja. Not again.

25:02.429 --> 25:05.220
I thought ninja only hung out in Japan.

25:05.429 --> 25:08.012
No, they were here.

25:08.137 --> 25:12.386
Look... I don't want you guys
to get involved.

25:14.011 --> 25:15.636
I'm in, buddy.

25:15.844 --> 25:18.761
OK, but what about the tournament?

25:19.553 --> 25:23.053
To me, Izumo is much more important.

25:26.219 --> 25:29.678
- Dr Saxon, sorry for barging in.
- How are we doing, my dear?

25:29.969 --> 25:32.469
He fell for the Izumo disguise.

25:32.761 --> 25:35.803
But he's so good he got away from us.

25:36.011 --> 25:39.844
Perhaps we should use
more direct methods.

25:40.053 --> 25:43.303
No, no, no.
Chan Lee is right in her pursual.

25:43.553 --> 25:47.553
If she hasn't ensnared him yet
it's because he's doubly powerful,

25:47.719 --> 25:49.553
in body and mind.

25:49.719 --> 25:54.553
I have every confidence in you, Chan Lee.
Bring him back, OK?

25:54.886 --> 25:56.803
Thank you.

26:03.469 --> 26:07.553
<i>- You guys hungry?
- I don't think I want any of this here.</i>

26:09.511 --> 26:14.511
Let's go grab some of that Caribbean food.
Maybe a glass or two of wine, huh?

26:14.719 --> 26:18.135
We could get some dates.
What do you say, guys, huh?

26:18.343 --> 26:20.052
Sounds good, huh, guy?

26:20.260 --> 26:21.760
Wait.

26:23.302 --> 26:25.593
- What is it?
- I don't know.

26:27.177 --> 26:28.593
A feeling.

26:32.052 --> 26:34.385
<i>Who the hell are these guys?</i>

26:34.552 --> 26:37.177
You gotta be kidding.

26:39.010 --> 26:41.927
Well, got no choice.

26:43.010 --> 26:45.968
- OK. Let's spread out.
- Hm.

26:47.177 --> 26:48.552
Right. OK.

27:14.802 --> 27:17.385
Can't believe I'm looking for ninjas.

27:17.593 --> 27:20.551
I thought I stopped doing this
when I left Joe back in the army.

29:34.674 --> 29:36.299
What a damn day.

29:41.799 --> 29:43.882
Where's Izumo? Tell me!

29:53.424 --> 29:55.715
- Sean.
- Jackson. You all right?

29:55.882 --> 29:58.674
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys. I got one. Guess what?

29:58.882 --> 30:03.132
- What are you doing up there?
- I saw where some went. There.

30:05.340 --> 30:08.715
OK, come on down. Let's go.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.549
Right this way.

30:12.215 --> 30:16.757
<i>They're doing something in there
they want nobody to know about.</i>

30:19.840 --> 30:22.465
<i>- We're being watched.
- Yep.</i>

30:22.590 --> 30:24.674
Like they've been waiting for us.

30:24.799 --> 30:26.924
It's all too convenient.

30:27.049 --> 30:29.882
Would someone mind telling me
what's going on?

30:31.214 --> 30:34.673
<i>- It's saiminjutsu.
- Huh?</i>

30:35.256 --> 30:37.673
Way of the mind game.

30:37.881 --> 30:41.964
- Which is?
- We're being manipulated.

30:51.714 --> 30:53.923
I'm here to see the minister's secretary.

30:54.131 --> 30:56.339
- Right through there, please.
- There?

31:06.506 --> 31:07.923
Sir. May I help you?

31:08.173 --> 31:13.381
Yes. Hi, uh... I'm Sean Davidson.
I called your office about Mr Izumo.

31:13.673 --> 31:16.714
- Yes, they told me. Please take a seat.
- Thank you.

31:17.048 --> 31:19.506
I've done some checking for you,

31:19.714 --> 31:23.089
but there's been nothing
on anyone named Izumo

31:23.339 --> 31:26.548
or any Japanese gentleman
entering the country.

31:26.756 --> 31:29.881
No, but I saw him here.

31:31.673 --> 31:36.130
I have reason to believe that he's being
held at East Bay Laboratories.

31:36.422 --> 31:42.172
Please understand. East Bay is a scientific
research centre. It's low-profile.

31:42.463 --> 31:45.880
Dr Saxon is doing
some very valuable work there.

31:46.047 --> 31:49.963
- What kind of work?
- They develop and manufacture drugs.

31:50.213 --> 31:52.172
- Drugs?
- Yes.

31:52.463 --> 31:57.505
The kind that cure people. The kind
that can't be made in the United States.

31:57.713 --> 32:01.880
- Is there a problem?
- No, sir. No problem, everything's fine.

32:02.047 --> 32:05.713
Would you bring me the file
on East Bay Labs, please?

32:07.338 --> 32:10.922
- Excuse me...
- Oh, I'm sorry. I really am very busy.

32:11.047 --> 32:14.213
I have to attend to the
minister's business.

32:14.422 --> 32:19.297
- Could you just tell me...
- I am busy. I hope I've been of some help.

32:22.088 --> 32:24.588
Fine. Thank you.

32:47.879 --> 32:51.712
You know, I keep getting the feeling
they're all around us.

32:51.921 --> 32:53.337
Who?

32:55.087 --> 32:57.171
What's up?

32:57.462 --> 33:00.712
I got nowhere
with the minister's secretary today.

33:00.962 --> 33:03.546
Hm. Tell me something new.

33:04.462 --> 33:08.046
Sean, how about if we spoke
to the local police?

33:11.087 --> 33:13.629
No, we're gonna need
a more aggressive approach.

33:13.796 --> 33:16.837
Hm. I'll give it a crack anyway.

33:17.046 --> 33:20.421
Who knows?
Maybe they speak my language.

33:21.587 --> 33:25.171
- Thanks. Appreciate it.
- OK.

33:33.546 --> 33:36.296
- Excuse me.
- Address?

33:36.587 --> 33:38.296
Excuse me.

33:40.337 --> 33:41.879
- Excuse me.
- What?

33:44.211 --> 33:46.586
Who can I see about a missing person?

33:46.836 --> 33:48.711
Captain.

33:49.753 --> 33:51.170
Inside.

33:52.503 --> 33:56.211
So none of you guys
have ever seen this man?

33:58.461 --> 34:00.753
Perhaps he doesn't want to be found.

34:02.128 --> 34:04.253
People come here to get away,

34:04.461 --> 34:08.628
from other people,
from financial problems, to get married.

34:08.835 --> 34:12.335
Yeah, yeah. Captain,
I think you're starting to jerk me around.

34:12.545 --> 34:14.960
What makes him so special?

34:15.128 --> 34:18.795
Number one,
my friend saw him kidnapped.

34:18.960 --> 34:24.253
And number two, we think
he's being held in East Bay Labs.

34:24.503 --> 34:28.295
East Bay Labs is one of this community's
strongest supporters.

34:28.545 --> 34:32.710
Their business is making drugs,
not trouble.

34:32.878 --> 34:35.878
Well, Captain, baby,
that's kind of a contradiction.

34:36.085 --> 34:40.460
If they're not looking for trouble,
why all the high security over there, hm?

34:40.753 --> 34:44.295
To protect their work from thieves
and prying eyes.

34:44.420 --> 34:48.043
- And...
- I resemble that remark.

34:49.168 --> 34:52.210
Look, Lancelot, here's some money.

34:52.418 --> 34:55.335
Now go see a movie. Cheer up!

34:56.793 --> 34:59.294
- Look, my man...
- I'm not your man.

34:59.585 --> 35:04.169
Now, look. The less straight answers I get,
the more curious I'm gonna be.

35:04.377 --> 35:07.085
I wouldn't follow that route if I were you.

35:08.127 --> 35:11.085
- Are you threatening me?
- Not yet.

35:11.335 --> 35:15.627
Remember, you and your friends
were invited as guests to this island.

35:15.835 --> 35:20.002
- Don't abuse your privilege.
- Or what?

35:21.502 --> 35:23.085
Good day, sir.

35:28.710 --> 35:31.210
You're breathing my air.

35:35.377 --> 35:37.669
Give me back my money.

35:45.335 --> 35:50.002
<i>Invading bacterial phages,
penetrating and destroying cells.</i>

35:50.252 --> 35:54.168
Mutating viruses change form so quickly.

35:54.376 --> 35:58.793
Before a vaccine can be invented, they've
changed form and become immune.

35:59.001 --> 36:05.043
This is the basis for the most potentially
dangerous warfare known to mankind.

36:06.584 --> 36:07.959
Germ warfare.

36:09.918 --> 36:13.501
When will you show us your experiment
and stop lecturing?

36:13.668 --> 36:17.793
Excuse me, General Andreas.
This is not a military sideshow.

36:18.001 --> 36:20.918
This is a precise scientific exercise.

36:21.126 --> 36:24.418
All I'm asking of you
is just three more days.

36:24.668 --> 36:28.418
Then I'll show you the most
fantastic scientific advancement

36:28.668 --> 36:30.793
ever known to mankind.

36:31.001 --> 36:34.126
Three more days.
That's not too much to ask.

36:36.751 --> 36:41.459
The other guests seem content
to wait for your demonstration.

36:41.668 --> 36:44.251
But I have never been a patient man.

36:44.418 --> 36:50.334
Listen, my impatient man. I've given you
your power and I can take it away.

36:50.501 --> 36:54.334
These nice people seem content to wait.
So you be content.

36:54.543 --> 36:57.458
Relax. Have a nice day.

36:57.750 --> 36:59.708
All right.

37:01.375 --> 37:02.750
Drive.

37:10.042 --> 37:12.833
Chan Lee. How are we doing?

37:12.958 --> 37:15.750
I have never failed you.

37:16.042 --> 37:20.750
He's not like the others. He's ninja.
Why have you chosen him?

37:21.042 --> 37:24.708
He's gonna show people
who live off the miseries of others

37:24.917 --> 37:27.625
that they're vulnerable like anybody else.

37:27.875 --> 37:31.792
I can't see why anyone would want
to stop a cure for disease.

37:32.042 --> 37:37.292
I've seen men do a lot worse things
than that. All right? Just believe me.

37:40.083 --> 37:42.375
We must find out
what they've done with Izumo.

37:42.583 --> 37:47.250
<i>There's a lot of clues. We need
to put it together, make sense out of it.</i>

37:49.667 --> 37:52.792
It's time to pay a visit to East Bay Labs.

37:55.292 --> 37:59.124
- How do we get in?
- Nobody's afraid of flying, are they?

38:26.832 --> 38:30.749
- OK. Do your thing.
- Piece of cake. I'll take care of it.

38:32.957 --> 38:34.374
<i>Come on, Dexter.</i>

38:35.957 --> 38:37.374
Let's go, Junior.

38:37.624 --> 38:39.374
You're mine.

38:42.624 --> 38:45.249
- Can he really do this?
- I hope so.

38:45.499 --> 38:47.582
Junior, come on.

38:47.707 --> 38:50.332
- I'll tell you one thing.
- What?

38:50.333 --> 38:54.791
- It has nothing to do with what you hear.
- OK, come on, do it.

38:56.041 --> 38:58.249
- It's about time.
- Good.

38:58.374 --> 39:00.124
Here we go.

39:00.332 --> 39:02.541
<i>- Wow.
- Boy, there they are.</i>

39:04.623 --> 39:06.748
Two of us have got a ride.

39:06.956 --> 39:12.040
- I'm gonna try and get this truck started.
- OK. We'll get this.

39:12.248 --> 39:16.331
<i>Curtis will wait
and get us out with the truck, all right?</i>

39:24.456 --> 39:28.290
<i>- You still with me, Dex?
- Right behind you, Ace.</i>

39:35.998 --> 39:38.165
<i>Ever flown one of these before, Dexter?</i>

39:38.373 --> 39:39.915
<i>Lots of times.</i>

39:40.081 --> 39:42.165
<i>Whoa... Aah! Whoa...!</i>

39:44.790 --> 39:50.040
<i>When we hit the lab, I'll find Izumo.
You get Curtis inside with the truck.</i>

40:08.789 --> 40:13.122
<i>- Any sign of Curtis?
- Yeah. There he is. And he's cooking.</i>

40:21.455 --> 40:25.789
<i>Sean, is it OK if I go down
and give Mr Jackson a little hello?</i>

40:25.914 --> 40:30.330
<i>I think we'd better keep our minds
on the mission, Dex.</i>

40:30.580 --> 40:32.997
<i>No problem, Sean. It's all under control.</i>

40:35.872 --> 40:40.539
<i>- Sean, I've got a problem!
- Don't panic. Try the gas pump.</i>

40:40.664 --> 40:42.997
<i>The line's burst. I'm going down!</i>

40:43.289 --> 40:46.455
<i>Pull the engine cord.</i>

40:46.705 --> 40:49.580
<i>- It's not catching.
- Keep trying, Dexter.</i>

40:49.830 --> 40:52.205
<i>Come on, baby. Don't do this to me.</i>

40:52.955 --> 40:54.289
<i>OK, you got it.</i>

40:55.455 --> 40:57.539
<i>Sean, I'm losing control.</i>

40:57.664 --> 41:00.664
<i>Push up on the bar and level off.</i>

41:00.914 --> 41:03.830
<i>Now try the engine again.</i>

41:07.622 --> 41:12.621
<i>- Sean, I'm gonna hit!
- Don't quit, Dex. Start that engine.</i>

41:15.413 --> 41:16.996
<i>You did it, Dex.</i>

41:17.121 --> 41:21.454
<i>The engine will never make it.
I've got to try to land on that road.</i>

41:21.746 --> 41:24.704
<i>That road's too rough.
You'll smash that thing apart.</i>

41:24.913 --> 41:26.996
<i>I've got to do something right now.</i>

41:27.204 --> 41:30.079
<i>You're gonna land
on the back of the truck.</i>

41:30.329 --> 41:34.746
<i>- No way! I'll never make it.
- It's your only chance. You've got to try.</i>

41:34.954 --> 41:36.704
<i>- But, Sean...
- Do it, Dexter.</i>

41:38.538 --> 41:41.954
<i>Just relax, Dex. Let the controls flow.</i>

41:43.288 --> 41:45.371
<i>All right. Here I go.</i>

41:49.121 --> 41:54.246
<i>- I don't like this, Sean.
- Careful, Dex. You're going too fast.</i>

41:57.871 --> 42:00.829
<i>- That was too close.
- This is crazy. I can't do it.</i>

42:01.079 --> 42:05.996
<i>Try again, Dex. This time I'll talk you
through it. Circle around.</i>

42:10.204 --> 42:13.663
<i>Last chance, Sean.
The engine's gonna go any second.</i>

42:16.828 --> 42:18.662
<i>Keep your front wheel up.</i>

42:18.787 --> 42:22.328
<i>Steady. Now cut your speed.</i>

42:25.703 --> 42:28.537
<i>Steady. Steady.</i>

42:28.745 --> 42:30.453
<i>Now take her in.</i>

42:32.328 --> 42:33.953
<i>Yeah!</i>

42:36.453 --> 42:39.620
<i>Way to go, Dex.</i>

42:39.787 --> 42:43.412
<i>Thanks, Sean.
Wouldn't have made it without you.</i>

42:43.662 --> 42:47.287
<i>I gotta get to Izumo.
Wait for me outside the lab.</i>

42:47.578 --> 42:49.578
<i>You guys be careful.</i>

42:51.120 --> 42:53.620
- Some landing! Was I good or what?
- Yeah, great.

42:53.828 --> 42:58.703
Sky King, let's dump that baby. We've got
to meet Sean and Izumo outside the lab.

44:50.535 --> 44:52.618
Close the door quietly.

44:57.035 --> 44:58.660
Let's go.

47:24.033 --> 47:26.824
<i>He must have got in OK by now.</i>

47:27.866 --> 47:30.741
Maybe. Let's just hope he found Izumo.

47:32.616 --> 47:34.448
So, shall we go?

47:36.740 --> 47:38.407
Mm-mm. No.

50:23.571 --> 50:26.946
<i>Aaah!</i>

50:55.112 --> 50:57.862
So, you came here as I planned.

50:59.029 --> 51:00.404
Who are you?

51:00.570 --> 51:04.279
- Why'd your men attack me?
- To get you here.

51:04.487 --> 51:07.112
To tickle my fancy.

51:07.404 --> 51:10.820
Curiosity is a real dangerous drug,
you know.

51:13.154 --> 51:17.195
So the tournament
was a scam to lure me here.

51:17.404 --> 51:19.904
No. To lure the best one here.

51:22.112 --> 51:24.904
That just turned out to be you.

51:25.112 --> 51:26.987
A ninja.

51:28.237 --> 51:30.529
Is that why you have my master Izumo?

51:31.820 --> 51:36.195
- Yes, I guess you might say that.
- So he's here?

51:37.570 --> 51:41.112
Let's just say
that really doesn't count right now.

51:41.404 --> 51:45.029
What's important is your usefulness to me,

51:45.237 --> 51:49.529
proving the power
and the effectiveness of my new disease.

51:50.611 --> 51:52.444
Boys.

52:14.611 --> 52:17.319
<i>Well, no news is good news.</i>

52:21.028 --> 52:24.278
- OK, Curtis. What now?
- We wait, Junior.

53:19.402 --> 53:20.610
Who are you?

53:20.943 --> 53:24.402
I need some answers.
I know you are ninja.

53:27.193 --> 53:31.693
- So?
- Listen, your life is in terrible danger.

53:34.027 --> 53:37.318
Who else knows about Izumo?

53:37.527 --> 53:41.068
- Why should I tell you?
- I'm here to help.

53:42.360 --> 53:43.860
Please.

53:45.027 --> 53:48.068
My two friends know,

53:48.277 --> 53:51.860
the police and the minister's secretary.

53:52.068 --> 53:55.735
- Now everyone's involved.
- What is going on here?

53:56.027 --> 53:58.692
I'm not sure yet.

53:58.859 --> 54:02.859
- But I'm gonna find out.
- Wait.

54:09.109 --> 54:11.109
<i>Dr Saxon, the minister's secretary is here.</i>

54:11.317 --> 54:13.776
Nice of you to see me at short notice.

54:14.109 --> 54:16.651
We like to help people of the community.

54:16.942 --> 54:21.401
Dr Holger, could you see to it
that our mouse is fed?

54:21.526 --> 54:24.109
It's breakfast time in the lab, you know.

54:25.276 --> 54:27.984
What can I do for you this fine morning?

54:28.276 --> 54:31.942
Doctor, you probably don't realise,

54:32.192 --> 54:35.651
but the minister has concerns about you
and your operation.

54:35.901 --> 54:37.734
He doubts your sincerity.

54:37.984 --> 54:42.526
My sincerity? My dear girl, my whole life's
work is tied up in this project.

54:42.734 --> 54:47.359
Yes, but the question is,
what exactly is that work?

54:47.692 --> 54:51.067
Well, if you don't understand
the nature of my experiment,

54:51.276 --> 54:53.734
one of my scientists could explain it.

54:53.942 --> 54:57.401
No, that's not the point.
We've done some checking.

54:57.567 --> 55:01.567
Er... A certain General Andreas

55:01.776 --> 55:07.733
was known to Interpol as a notorious
terrorist, missing for several years.

55:07.983 --> 55:11.441
I don't think we could be
talking about the same man.

55:11.566 --> 55:14.775
These deadly virus strains
you've been working with...

55:14.983 --> 55:20.941
With minor modifications, could they not
be useful to a man in his line of work?

55:21.191 --> 55:23.400
What is it exactly that you want?

55:24.525 --> 55:28.858
Well, my position has some prestige to it,

55:29.150 --> 55:34.441
but the burdens are enormous
and the salary unfortunately is less so.

55:34.650 --> 55:36.691
Ah. I see.

55:36.858 --> 55:38.566
It's funny you mention it.

55:38.775 --> 55:42.733
Dr Holger and I were discussing
the need for an assistant

55:42.858 --> 55:45.650
to help us further our operations.

55:45.858 --> 55:48.858
Could I put my name up for consideration?

55:49.025 --> 55:53.275
Absolutely. I can't think of anyone
who'd be more qualified.

55:53.483 --> 55:56.900
I'll just, uh... send you over
a retainer cheque tomorrow.

55:57.108 --> 55:58.483
- That'd be fine.
- Great.

55:58.733 --> 56:01.525
Now, if you'll excuse me.

56:01.691 --> 56:04.316
Give my regards to the minister, will you?

56:04.400 --> 56:07.399
And thank you so much for coming.

56:07.607 --> 56:10.440
You're a great woman
and I appreciate your advice.

56:10.649 --> 56:12.315
Thank you.

56:12.524 --> 56:13.899
Bye.

56:20.940 --> 56:22.940
She knows.

56:23.149 --> 56:26.524
I warned you. She's excessively ambitious.

56:27.815 --> 56:31.065
My dear boy, we'll just have to do
what we have to do.

56:31.274 --> 56:33.857
Relieve her of that unfortunate ailment.

56:36.440 --> 56:38.690
I'll see to it myself.

57:12.439 --> 57:16.939
<i>It's the minister's secretary.
What has she been doing here?</i>

57:22.689 --> 57:25.481
- Let's get back to the truck.
- OK.

57:26.981 --> 57:28.981
Everything in order. Thank you.

59:39.396 --> 59:40.812
Calm down.

59:49.687 --> 59:51.229
That'll do for now.

59:52.146 --> 59:53.771
Go. Relax.

59:56.896 --> 01:00:01.979
Electronarcosis. A little something
we developed in the lab. Works well.

01:00:02.104 --> 01:00:07.062
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing personal, my dear boy.

01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:09.896
You're just a victim for this experiment.

01:00:09.979 --> 01:00:12.646
By the time this gun's effect wears off,

01:00:12.812 --> 01:00:16.437
- you will have outlived your usefulness.
- We'll see.

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:27.228
Ah, impatient one, how are you? I trust
this subject meets with your approval.

01:00:28.061 --> 01:00:29.353
Yes.

01:00:31.311 --> 01:00:32.770
Perfect.

01:00:33.061 --> 01:00:34.686
Very good. Come, relax.

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:38.811
I'll show you the ultimate test
in designer death.

01:00:41.145 --> 01:00:42.770
I'm really worried about Sean.

01:00:42.978 --> 01:00:45.436
Me too, but let's give him more time.

01:00:45.645 --> 01:00:48.103
Time? Man, he's had enough.

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:53.436
We've got to do something.

01:00:54.686 --> 01:00:58.853
I'm beginning to like your attitude.
No more wine, women and song?

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:00.728
That was before.

01:01:00.936 --> 01:01:04.770
Time is running out.
We can't afford to waste any more.

01:01:05.978 --> 01:01:07.686
And who are you?

01:01:14.061 --> 01:01:17.978
- The only one who can help you.
- All right, start explaining.

01:01:18.228 --> 01:01:22.603
Your friend has been caught
by the head of East Bay Labs.

01:01:22.853 --> 01:01:27.935
He's known as the Cobra and he plans
to kill your friend. He must be stopped.

01:01:28.227 --> 01:01:32.727
Unfortunately, my ninja are no longer
loyal to me. I need your help.

01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:37.102
Now we got ninjettes.

01:01:41.977 --> 01:01:44.185
Let's talk, sweetheart.

01:02:05.227 --> 01:02:07.227
Not so strong, huh, ninja?

01:02:16.977 --> 01:02:20.644
Take our soon-to-be-dead friend
to the ship.

01:02:20.852 --> 01:02:22.977
If Cobra kills Sean with his virus,

01:02:23.227 --> 01:02:26.227
he will prove to Andreas
how powerful they can be.

01:02:26.352 --> 01:02:28.644
Let me get this straight.

01:02:28.852 --> 01:02:31.309
He's selling out to a terrorist?

01:02:31.476 --> 01:02:32.851
Exactly.

01:02:33.143 --> 01:02:35.143
That's wholesale slaughter.

01:02:35.476 --> 01:02:37.893
That sounds like real bad news to me.

01:02:38.143 --> 01:02:41.143
Hey, don't underestimate that man.

01:02:41.351 --> 01:02:44.309
He's not called the Cobra for nothing.

01:02:44.643 --> 01:02:46.601
It's your call, Curtis.

01:02:50.393 --> 01:02:52.184
OK, darling.

01:02:54.226 --> 01:02:56.226
Let's go kick some ass.

01:02:57.768 --> 01:02:59.934
We need to head for the docks.

01:03:01.684 --> 01:03:04.351
<i>The Cobra
will have injected Sean with the virus.</i>

01:03:04.559 --> 01:03:07.684
He'll be taking him to his ship.

01:03:17.518 --> 01:03:19.768
<i>Good. He's only just arrived.</i>

01:03:19.976 --> 01:03:23.559
<i>But look at the state he's in.
He can hardly walk.</i>

01:03:23.809 --> 01:03:25.643
Where are they gonna take him?

01:03:25.851 --> 01:03:29.684
Out of here,
so no one will know what Cobra's up to.

01:03:29.851 --> 01:03:31.809
- Time to do it.
- Wait.

01:03:32.101 --> 01:03:37.350
I go first. No slip-ups.
Cobra's not the forgiving type.

01:03:37.683 --> 01:03:41.267
You just get there, ninjette baby.
We'll do the rest.

01:05:34.724 --> 01:05:36.182
Curtis!

01:05:41.057 --> 01:05:42.473
Get out of my way.

01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:44.640
Jerk.

01:06:09.723 --> 01:06:12.015
<i>Well done, ninjette baby.</i>

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:18.723
<i>This way.</i>

01:06:31.223 --> 01:06:33.931
- Junior!
- Thanks.

01:06:36.556 --> 01:06:38.931
- Wait...
- No time to explain.

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:43.390
On the contrary.
There's plenty of time to explain.

01:06:43.598 --> 01:06:45.722
- Who's this?
- Cobra's partner.

01:06:46.055 --> 01:06:48.972
Shut your mouth. Get away from him.

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:51.639
He's the only one of value.

01:06:54.722 --> 01:06:56.389
I said move!

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.805
- So it's me you want.
- Uh-huh.

01:07:04.097 --> 01:07:09.097
- And no sudden moves.
- You got it.

01:07:18.014 --> 01:07:19.555
All right.

01:07:27.097 --> 01:07:29.180
- No!
- Sean!

01:07:36.097 --> 01:07:38.639
- We don't have much time.
- For what?

01:07:38.764 --> 01:07:40.972
To get you the antidote.

01:07:41.305 --> 01:07:45.014
No. That electronarcosis stuff
has about worn off.

01:07:45.264 --> 01:07:47.347
He zapped you with a virus.

01:07:47.555 --> 01:07:50.138
- We've got to get Izumo.
- Sean...

01:08:08.888 --> 01:08:10.471
<i>You are a kunoichi?</i>

01:08:10.763 --> 01:08:11.721
Yes.

01:08:13.054 --> 01:08:16.388
<i>- Hensojutsu?
- I am a master.</i>

01:08:17.804 --> 01:08:19.804
Now I see.

01:08:21.970 --> 01:08:24.638
- Izumo...
- Izumo was you.

01:08:25.763 --> 01:08:27.304
Yes.

01:08:30.138 --> 01:08:35.345
I thought I was doing the right thing.
I did not know that they were evil.

01:08:38.679 --> 01:08:41.345
It's time for action. Let's go.

01:08:41.554 --> 01:08:42.388
OK.

01:09:07.178 --> 01:09:10.595
The minister's secretary
is here to see Dr Saxon.

01:09:12.136 --> 01:09:15.303
How can she make herself
into different people so perfectly?

01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:19.136
<i>Disguise and illusion. Hensojutsu.</i>

01:09:19.428 --> 01:09:23.261
<i>- Hensojutsu?
- It's the ancient art of impersonation.</i>

01:09:23.511 --> 01:09:27.761
<i>The kunoichi, the female ninja,
they're masters at it.</i>

01:09:41.011 --> 01:09:42.720
Where'd she go?

01:10:04.886 --> 01:10:06.469
Machine-gun work?

01:10:07.427 --> 01:10:09.511
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:10:13.677 --> 01:10:15.261
- I'm OK.
- Good.

01:10:16.219 --> 01:10:20.302
Look, if we don't get that vaccine in time,
you've got to kill me.

01:10:20.511 --> 01:10:22.552
- What?
- If it doesn't work...

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:27.261
- It will.
- If it doesn't, and I lose it,

01:10:27.552 --> 01:10:29.052
you gotta kill me.

01:10:29.177 --> 01:10:30.886
You or Jackson.

01:10:35.886 --> 01:10:37.969
Do you understand?

01:10:39.761 --> 01:10:42.261
You know what we're up against here.

01:10:44.427 --> 01:10:46.511
I have your word?

01:10:48.261 --> 01:10:50.261
Yeah. You got it.

01:10:51.302 --> 01:10:52.136
OK.

01:11:00.344 --> 01:11:02.176
Let's go.

01:12:30.009 --> 01:12:32.009
What's going on? Sirens are blazing.

01:12:32.175 --> 01:12:34.425
The minister's unhappy.
It's all going crazy.

01:12:34.675 --> 01:12:39.259
The Americans escaped...
and General Andreas is dead.

01:12:39.509 --> 01:12:42.967
Andreas is dead.
This could ruin us, you know.

01:12:43.134 --> 01:12:44.842
Get me Chan Lee.

01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:48.342
The ninjas say
that she helped them get away.

01:12:48.509 --> 01:12:50.175
Stupid incompetent idiot!

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:55.300
Well... they're turning against me.

01:12:55.509 --> 01:12:57.717
It's happened before,

01:12:57.925 --> 01:13:00.509
and I must say to no avail.

01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:06.842
Alert the ninja.
I think we'll be having company.

01:13:06.967 --> 01:13:11.466
And don't screw it up this time!
Shut off those sirens.

01:13:26.883 --> 01:13:28.133
Good evening.

01:13:41.508 --> 01:13:44.633
- I, er... I thought I might meet you here.
- Ah.

01:13:45.549 --> 01:13:49.508
Well, it appears that you're after
much more than just a meeting.

01:13:49.674 --> 01:13:51.674
Not at all, Doctor.

01:13:51.883 --> 01:13:56.549
Come on.
Your disguise is quite apparent, Chan Lee.

01:14:07.799 --> 01:14:10.883
You said your cause
was for the good of mankind.

01:14:11.008 --> 01:14:15.757
- My cause is a good one.
- For those possessed by evil.

01:14:22.007 --> 01:14:24.590
I was taking the antidote to the American.

01:14:24.798 --> 01:14:28.257
Oh, really? Do what you have to do.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:31.923
But I'm telling you, you are deluded.

01:14:32.215 --> 01:14:36.423
I'm not going to listen to you any more.
You are the snake.

01:18:07.212 --> 01:18:08.629
Die!

01:18:11.504 --> 01:18:13.795
Take these. I'll meet you at the car.

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:17.212
- Is there...?
- No, just get the hell out of here!

01:18:22.212 --> 01:18:24.170
Is everything all right?

01:18:57.961 --> 01:19:00.503
All right, Cobra.

01:19:00.711 --> 01:19:02.836
Your turn to die.

01:19:35.877 --> 01:19:38.502
- One answer. Where's the lab?
- Why?

01:19:40.335 --> 01:19:44.502
Just be careful of this stuff, will you?
It's dangerous. It's glass.

01:19:44.710 --> 01:19:46.585
What is it?

01:19:46.752 --> 01:19:48.127
What is it?

01:19:48.335 --> 01:19:52.668
- Uh... It's a urine sample.
- Jesus, don't piss me off!

01:19:53.002 --> 01:19:54.377
What is it?

01:19:54.585 --> 01:19:58.418
It's viral antidote. Be careful, will you?

01:19:58.585 --> 01:20:02.960
Very good, Stretch. Now, again - the lab?

01:20:03.210 --> 01:20:06.210
Up those stairs. Up there.

01:20:13.127 --> 01:20:14.918
All right.

01:20:46.376 --> 01:20:48.251
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:50.042
Right here, Stretch.

01:22:23.458 --> 01:22:25.208
Oh, no.

01:22:27.166 --> 01:22:28.541
Oh, Chan...

01:22:32.291 --> 01:22:34.375
Oh, God...

01:22:53.415 --> 01:22:57.040
Another illusion you believed in
shattered?

01:22:57.165 --> 01:23:02.374
- There's no cure for your disease.
- Give me the damn antidote.

01:23:02.624 --> 01:23:07.999
- Sure. I've got all the formulas.
- You won't get away with it.

01:23:09.374 --> 01:23:10.874
Really?

01:23:10.999 --> 01:23:13.499
But I am getting away with it.

01:23:13.665 --> 01:23:16.915
Like I said,
you've outlived your usefulness.

01:23:34.582 --> 01:23:37.207
<i>Your mind and soul
over your body.</i>

01:23:37.307 --> 01:23:42.249
<i>Remember that, Sean.
Mind and soul over your body.</i>

01:24:25.706 --> 01:24:27.123
Cobra.

01:25:51.288 --> 01:25:54.205
Hey, Sean. Here's the antidote, man.

01:25:55.955 --> 01:25:59.204
<i>I don't need it any more.</i>

01:25:59.329 --> 01:26:01.996
- Hey, you OK?
- Yeah.

01:26:02.996 --> 01:26:06.621
You know what I went through
to get this for you?

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:09.996
Let's go home.

01:26:18.412 --> 01:26:20.621
Hai... ya!

01:26:28.829 --> 01:26:31.537
I think you're finished. Let's go, pal.

01:26:31.829 --> 01:26:33.829
Look, if we're gonna remain friends,

01:26:34.037 --> 01:26:37.162
can't we fight other bad guys,
like robbers, thieves and muggers?

01:26:37.371 --> 01:26:43.204
Does it have to be ninjas? You know
how long I've been fighting ninjas?
