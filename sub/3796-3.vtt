Hi, my name is Vince
and I'm a drug addict.

01:17.690 --> 01:18.954
Hi, Vince.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.239
It's been three and a half months
since I've last used

01:22.364 --> 01:23.834
and I'm doing okay.

01:24.133 --> 01:26.628
<i>The key for me
has been keeping my mind busy,</i>

01:27.004 --> 01:28.136
trying new things.

01:28.261 --> 01:30.632
In fact, I just finished
writing my first screenplay.

01:31.010 --> 01:33.218
- Good for you.

01:33.580 --> 01:35.792
Relax, it sucked.

01:35.917 --> 01:37.895
<i>But we'll see if I can find
someone to produce it.</i>

01:38.020 --> 01:41.233
Does anyone know anybody?

01:41.358 --> 01:43.270
I do. Hey.

01:45.530 --> 01:47.375
<i>Turtle.</i>

01:47.500 --> 01:49.444
- Yo.
- Why'd you walk out?

01:49.569 --> 01:51.681
Some of the people in there
were freaking me out.

01:51.806 --> 01:52.939
I didn't realize
there'd be so much sharing.

01:53.064 --> 01:53.851
That's what helps,

01:53.976 --> 01:56.355
knowing that other people are going
through the same things you did.

01:56.480 --> 01:58.259
I don't know how much
you can relate to the girl

01:58.384 --> 02:00.428
who blew her brother
for an 8-ball, but I hear you.

02:00.553 --> 02:01.974
More importantly,
did you see who was in there?

02:02.099 --> 02:02.632
No.

02:02.757 --> 02:04.401
- Hey, Vince!
- Him.

02:04.526 --> 02:06.293
- <i>Who's that?</i>
- <i>Carl Ertz.</i>

02:06.459 --> 02:08.639
The douchebag that fucked us
over on "Danger Beach"?

02:08.764 --> 02:10.977
Yup. But in the program
we learn to make amends.

02:11.102 --> 02:13.113
- Hey, Vince. How are you?
- <i>I'm doing good, Carl.</i>

02:13.238 --> 02:15.550
I was just telling my buddy
over here how the program

02:15.675 --> 02:17.285
got me to let go of all
my anger towards you.

02:17.410 --> 02:18.787
Oh, that's good.

02:18.912 --> 02:21.266
I'm not in the program
so I still think you're a douche.

02:21.432 --> 02:23.827
Look, Vince.

02:23.952 --> 02:26.864
I fucked you out of a movie
once upon a time.

02:26.989 --> 02:28.523
A thousand apologies for that.

02:28.890 --> 02:30.633
I make no excuses,

02:30.758 --> 02:33.068
but those were in my
heavily drug-infused days.

02:33.193 --> 02:34.237
And if it's any consolation

02:34.494 --> 02:37.324
"Danger Beach" did $3 million
on 3000 screens.

02:37.697 --> 02:40.107
- Ooh, karma is a bitch.
- Turtle.

02:40.232 --> 02:41.870
Let it go.
It's all good.

02:42.234 --> 02:45.123
Look, Vince, I'd love another
shot at working together.

02:45.503 --> 02:47.480
Your script sounded amazing.

02:47.605 --> 02:49.048
I didn't tell you
anything about it.

02:49.173 --> 02:51.416
Working with you would be amazing.

02:51.541 --> 02:53.351
- It's not for me to star in.
- No?

02:53.476 --> 02:55.786
- It's for my brother Johnny.
- Oh.

02:55.911 --> 02:58.255
- Is it a feature?
- No, it's a TV movie.

02:58.380 --> 03:01.691
Then I really am your guy.
I made 15 of those last year.

03:01.816 --> 03:03.826
Including "The Menendez
Brothers at 40,"

03:03.951 --> 03:05.560
which got nominated for a peabody.

03:05.920 --> 03:09.314
Look, Vince,
would you send me the script?

03:09.689 --> 03:11.732
Please, I will get it done,
whatever it is.

03:11.857 --> 03:13.401
It'll be my official apology.

03:13.725 --> 03:15.821
I'll send you the script.
We'll go from there.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.495
Great.
I'm going to get some ice cream.

03:20.831 --> 03:22.641
Why would you send that jerkoff the script?

03:22.766 --> 03:24.075
It seems like he's trying.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.164
Besides, what's the worst
that can happen?

03:29.105 --> 03:30.794
Drama.

03:31.140 --> 03:33.483
Drama!

03:33.608 --> 03:36.487
- Yo.
- You look awful.

03:36.612 --> 03:40.023
Of course I do.
I haven't slept in days. Dice won't let me.

03:40.148 --> 03:41.724
- You should get separate beds.
- Funny.

03:41.849 --> 03:45.127
Just tell Dice that definitively you're not
walking off the show.

03:45.252 --> 03:46.762
It doesn't matter what I tell him.

03:46.887 --> 03:48.529
He just keeps coming
like the Terminator.

03:48.654 --> 03:50.438
- Was this guy's deal really that bad?
- Yes.

03:50.723 --> 03:54.201
Andrew Dice Clay is almost paying the
network to allow him to come to work.

03:54.326 --> 03:55.735
- Oh, come on.
- I swear to God.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.470
"Big Brother" contestants
get paid more.

03:57.595 --> 04:00.365
Well, it's not exactly
like I'm getting rich off this either, E.

04:00.531 --> 04:03.908
I got you 15 gnd an episode to sit
in an air-conditioned voice-over booth

04:04.033 --> 04:05.876
for three hours a week.
You feel underpaid?

04:06.001 --> 04:08.211
Dice tells me the guy
who does homer Simpson

04:08.336 --> 04:11.113
is getting paid 650 gs an episode
to do the same thing.

04:11.238 --> 04:13.381
Yeah, they're in season 23.

04:13.506 --> 04:15.049
You haven't even aired
episode one yet.

04:15.174 --> 04:17.752
- Listen, E, I think there could be more.
- Yeah, when the show airs.

04:17.877 --> 04:19.687
Well, this guy is driving
me fucking crazy, okay?

04:19.812 --> 04:22.222
Dice is coming after me
just like he's comin after him, all right?

04:22.347 --> 04:25.357
I think if we all get on the same page,
maybe there could be something.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.448
- By walking?
- No, by calling.

04:27.573 --> 04:28.622
Asking nicely.

04:28.747 --> 04:31.429
Coming to a reasonable
20 kittens an episode each.

04:31.554 --> 04:33.297
Yes, please.

04:33.422 --> 04:35.525
Tell them I'll donate
10% to charity.

04:35.758 --> 04:37.401
All right, you know what?
Fine.

04:37.526 --> 04:40.871
I'll make the stupidest fucking
phone call I've ever made.

04:40.996 --> 04:43.173
<i>I will talk
to Phil reasonably.</i>

04:43.298 --> 04:45.708
I will ask him nicely
if he thinks you're underpaid.

04:45.833 --> 04:48.177
And if he's willing to talk
to the network, fine.

04:48.302 --> 04:50.045
If not, we're done.
Agreed?

04:50.170 --> 04:52.709
Yes, agreed.
Thank you, E.

04:52.940 --> 04:54.616
I mean this sincerely, Vince.

04:54.741 --> 04:58.353
I would hack off my penis
before I would ever allow you

04:58.478 --> 05:00.055
to work with Carl Ertz again.

05:00.180 --> 05:02.024
- Don't be extreme, Ari.
- I am being mild.

05:02.149 --> 05:04.192
The guy is a menace
and we do not need him.

05:04.317 --> 05:06.627
I thought I'd get
this kind of response from E, not you.

05:06.752 --> 05:09.059
Listen, this may be the first
time I ever agree with E.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.798
You know you're the guy who put
me with Ertz in the first place, right?

05:11.923 --> 05:14.368
Yes, that's before
I knew what he was.

05:14.493 --> 05:17.304
- Really? And what is he?
- He is an addict.

05:17.429 --> 05:18.572
And what am I?

05:18.697 --> 05:22.040
You are the good kind
of addict.

05:22.165 --> 05:24.174
<i>You're the I-got-messed-up-
with-the-wrong-girl-</i>

05:24.299 --> 05:26.576
<i>and-ended-up-on-
a-blow-bender addict.</i>

05:26.701 --> 05:29.812
Ertz is the skeevy-old-man-who-
got-caught-with-a-crack-pipe-

05:29.937 --> 05:32.147
and-the-17-year-old-
from-"Speed Racer" addict.

05:32.272 --> 05:34.584
Michael Vick drowned puppies
and they let him play again.

05:34.874 --> 05:37.242
Well, Ertz does not have
Vick's arm strength.

05:39.045 --> 05:41.591
Why do you want to work with this guy?
Tell me.

05:41.757 --> 05:44.191
Because I <i>do</i> believe
in second chances.

05:44.316 --> 05:45.860
I've had more than that myself.

05:45.985 --> 05:48.062
That is why it is my job

05:48.187 --> 05:50.729
to protect you from
damaging yourself again.

05:50.854 --> 05:53.436
You're not protecting me.
You're not doing anything.

05:53.602 --> 05:53.964
Vinnie.

05:54.089 --> 05:56.933
I told you how important this was
for me to make this happen for Johnny.

05:57.058 --> 05:58.500
- Yeah.
- You're not motivated.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.335
- Untrue. I'm highly motivated.
- Really?

06:00.460 --> 06:02.403
Watch this. Lloyd!

06:02.528 --> 06:04.171
Let's talk to the head
of the TV department.

06:04.296 --> 06:06.272
- Loyd's the head of the TV department?
- The interim head.

06:06.397 --> 06:09.408
Until he fucks up, and then he's back
to pushing a mail cart.

06:09.533 --> 06:11.777
- Yes, Ari? Hello, Vince.
- Hey, Lloyd.

06:11.902 --> 06:14.046
Tell Vinnie what I told you
to work on for him.

06:14.171 --> 06:17.481
- I don't know.
- Are you joking?

06:17.606 --> 06:20.483
- I don't think so.
- The movie for Drama.

06:20.608 --> 06:22.819
What movie?
I don't know anything about this.

06:22.944 --> 06:24.720
- Are you joking?
- I don't think so.

06:24.845 --> 06:26.723
Jesus Christ, Lloyd.

06:26.848 --> 06:29.517
I sent you a fucking email.

06:30.619 --> 06:32.475
I meant to send you an email.

06:32.721 --> 06:35.432
- Ari.
- I'm sorry.

06:35.557 --> 06:37.801
He's distracted.
It's the separation, Vince.

06:37.926 --> 06:39.816
He'll never admit it,
but it's weighing on him.

06:40.062 --> 06:41.568
I thought you guys were
trying to get back together.

06:41.830 --> 06:44.574
The Mrs. Gold, she's seeing
a prominent restaurateur.

06:44.699 --> 06:46.442
Shut the fuck up, Lloyd.

06:46.567 --> 06:48.311
It's Vince.
He's family.

06:48.436 --> 06:49.701
Ari, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

06:49.970 --> 06:52.454
It's no excuse, all right?
I still should have done my job.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.783
No, forget about that.
Maybe you need to get out.

06:54.908 --> 06:56.207
What, to even the score?

06:56.373 --> 06:58.753
No, to live yourself.
It's been almost four months.

06:58.878 --> 07:00.378
- He's scared, Vince.
- I'm scared?

07:00.613 --> 07:02.505
Ari, it's been a while since
you've been with another woman.

07:02.671 --> 07:06.160
- It's natural.
- I'm not scared. I'm scared for the town.

07:06.285 --> 07:10.697
'Cause once I go out,
women will fall and men will start wailing.

07:10.822 --> 07:13.016
You do not want to compete
against me for ass, Vinnie.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.268
Ha.
I welcome the challenge.

07:15.684 --> 07:17.936
I told him I have someone for him.

07:18.061 --> 07:19.404
I told him I'm not turning gay.

07:19.529 --> 07:21.149
We would never have you, Ari.

07:21.315 --> 07:24.841
Look, Vince.
She's the niece of my hairstylist.

07:24.966 --> 07:26.780
Oh, she's sexy.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.577
<i>What did you say she does again?</i>

07:28.702 --> 07:31.613
She's an award-winning manicurist.

07:31.738 --> 07:34.240
I say you go for it.

07:35.208 --> 07:36.718
Make the call, Lloyd.

07:36.843 --> 07:38.416
Oh goody.
I'm so happy.

07:38.582 --> 07:39.721
And send Ertz an email.

07:39.846 --> 07:43.190
Chase, Walsh and Ertz present
an all-addict production.

07:43.315 --> 07:44.690
You tell him if he doesn't deliver

07:44.815 --> 07:47.359
I'm gonna excommunicate
him from this entire town.

07:47.484 --> 07:49.261
Done deal.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.295
So did you just come
to California to see me?

07:51.420 --> 07:54.064
No, I'm doing
"Today L.A." tomorrow.

07:54.189 --> 07:55.598
Seriously?

07:55.723 --> 07:58.544
Jillian Reynolds is letting me make
<i>pollo avion</i> live on television.

07:58.669 --> 07:59.642
That's incredible.

07:59.767 --> 08:02.237
Everything for our Tequila
has been incredible, Turtle.

08:02.362 --> 08:04.306
And I have you to thank
for a lot of it.

08:04.431 --> 08:07.242
I appreciate that.

08:07.367 --> 08:11.236
This is a small token
of my appreciation.

08:13.473 --> 08:15.316
Whoa.
A gold watch?

08:15.441 --> 08:16.996
- Yes. You like?
- I love it.

08:17.162 --> 08:19.219
You know, in the U.S.
they usually give someone

08:19.344 --> 08:22.579
a gold watch
when they're retiring.

08:24.715 --> 08:27.693
- Am I retiring?
- The other reason I'm here

08:27.818 --> 08:31.929
is the largest distribution company
in the states wants to handle our product.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.364
What does that mean?

08:33.489 --> 08:35.390
It means we're taking avion
to the next level.

08:35.556 --> 08:38.301
It means you no longer
need to work.

08:38.426 --> 08:40.537
Now you can just sit back
and watch myself

08:40.662 --> 08:42.005
and Mark Cuban
make your stock grow.

08:42.130 --> 08:43.731
Yeah, but I like working.

08:43.897 --> 08:46.359
I like doing the tastings
and I like doing the parties.

08:46.634 --> 08:48.944
And the parties have been great.
And your idea of putting Alex

08:49.069 --> 08:51.239
on the posters
and the billboards was ingenious.

08:51.405 --> 08:54.450
But this distribution company has a reach
you could never have.

08:54.740 --> 08:56.783
Did Alex know?

08:56.908 --> 08:58.618
Is this why she's
been dodging my calls?

08:58.743 --> 08:59.706
Among other reasons.

08:59.977 --> 09:02.287
What other reasons?

09:02.412 --> 09:04.335
Alex has met someone.

09:04.501 --> 09:06.257
Oh, so she told you to tell me?

09:06.382 --> 09:08.526
- <i>She said if it came up.</i>
- Yeah.

09:08.651 --> 09:11.953
First you're retiring me and then
you're breaking up with me for Alex?

09:13.888 --> 09:15.355
I'm sorry, Turtle.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.559
Are you out of
your fucking mind, Eric?

09:19.794 --> 09:21.204
What is it that you would
like me to say, huh?

09:21.329 --> 09:23.707
Hi, CBS.
I know you're taking a huge chance

09:23.832 --> 09:26.109
scheduling a prime time animated
sitcom starring somebody

09:26.234 --> 09:27.743
that nobody's ever heard of
and somebody else

09:27.868 --> 09:29.312
<i>that nobody's wanted
to hear from</i>

09:29.437 --> 09:30.913
<i>in like two
fucking decades,</i>

09:31.038 --> 09:32.982
but both those guys feel

09:33.107 --> 09:34.984
that even though not one
single fucking person

09:35.109 --> 09:36.918
has watched the show
that they're underpaid?

09:37.043 --> 09:39.553
- People have seen the test--
- Shh!

09:39.678 --> 09:41.372
- Is that Drama?
- Yeah, he just walked in.

09:41.647 --> 09:43.458
- <i>Who the fuck is that?</i>
- Scott Lavin.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.877
Is this how you guys
operate over there?

09:46.043 --> 09:48.862
<i>People covering up their mouths with
their hands so I don't hear them breathing?</i>

09:48.987 --> 09:50.506
No one's covering up
their mouths, Phil.

09:50.789 --> 09:53.635
- Is Dice there too?
- No, Phil. We're not crazy.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.736
Yeah well, Johnny, do yourself a favor
and don't let anybody cover up your ears

09:56.861 --> 10:00.239
Hey, dumb fuck, was this your idea?

10:00.364 --> 10:02.841
It was Dice's idea.
He's putting crazy things in my head.

10:02.966 --> 10:05.243
Yeah well, remind Dice that
when we cast him two months ago

10:05.368 --> 10:06.981
he was doing standup
in a fucking bowling alley.

10:07.147 --> 10:09.512
- He doesn't care.
- <i>Well, you'd better care, Johnny,</i>

10:09.637 --> 10:11.113
<i>because if you allow him
or anyone else</i>

10:11.238 --> 10:13.112
<i>to fuck this up,
you're bananas.</i>

10:13.374 --> 10:14.784
Go to Dice and tell him

10:14.909 --> 10:17.453
that you don't get a raise
because you test well.

10:17.578 --> 10:20.078
Maybe remind him about a show
called "concrete heat"

10:20.244 --> 10:22.747
<i>that I produced
and you starred in in 1994</i>

10:23.016 --> 10:25.293
and that tested through
the fucking moon.

10:25.418 --> 10:27.528
Do you remember that?

10:27.653 --> 10:29.504
Yeah, I remember that.

10:29.721 --> 10:32.132
- Yeah, you remember how long it lasted?
- One week.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.759
Many people thought it was canceled in
the second half hour.

10:34.992 --> 10:37.679
That's because they put us up
against fucking "Seinfeld."

10:37.961 --> 10:40.338
Drama,

10:40.463 --> 10:42.907
I know that doing a voice-over
is not what you want.

10:43.032 --> 10:46.576
I know that you want to get that precious
face of yours back in front of the camera.

10:46.701 --> 10:50.113
This will lead to all of that
if you're smart.

10:50.238 --> 10:53.516
So be smart and make sure
that crazy fuck is too

10:53.641 --> 10:56.364
or he will bury us all.

11:06.884 --> 11:08.293
So what are you thinking about?

11:08.459 --> 11:11.296
I'm not sure.
I'm not really hungry.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.006
Oh, you have a big lunch?

11:13.223 --> 11:15.190
No, I had an early dinner.

11:16.726 --> 11:18.177
Why'd you do that if you
knew I was getting you?

11:18.343 --> 11:20.430
I didn't know you were
taking me to dinner.

11:20.596 --> 11:23.107
- What did you think when I asked you out?
- I don't know.

11:23.232 --> 11:26.868
I haven't had a dinner date
in, well, ever.

11:28.804 --> 11:30.805
What do you usually
do on dates?

11:32.406 --> 11:34.717
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should have said.

11:34.842 --> 11:36.876
No, it's okay.

11:38.312 --> 11:41.757
You know, it's just that
I haven't been on many dates

11:41.882 --> 11:44.203
in-- in a--
in a long time.

11:44.450 --> 11:47.040
Yeah, Lloyd said you've been
married for like 40 years.

11:47.286 --> 11:49.463
19 years, but who's counting?

11:49.588 --> 11:52.920
That must be hard.
My parents just got divorced after 20.

11:53.086 --> 11:54.868
I don't think
we're getting divorced.

11:54.993 --> 11:56.703
Oh, I didn't mean--

11:56.828 --> 11:58.338
although we just might be.

11:58.463 --> 12:00.273
- It's none of my business.
- No, it's fine.

12:00.398 --> 12:02.708
I probably am getting divorced.

12:02.833 --> 12:06.110
And even if I'm not,

12:06.235 --> 12:10.313
let's have a good time.
Right? Okay?

12:10.572 --> 12:11.856
You want to do shots?

12:12.022 --> 12:13.900
- Shots?
- I think it'll loosen you up.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.319
I need to be loose.

12:16.444 --> 12:19.055
I am the incredibly tight
116-year-old man.

12:19.180 --> 12:21.358
- I apologize.
- It's okay.

12:21.483 --> 12:22.592
We're gonna have a good time.

12:22.717 --> 12:25.251
It just might take a moment
or two to get there,

12:27.054 --> 12:29.164
Turtle, hey.

12:29.289 --> 12:31.867
- Want to go to a movie?
- No.

12:31.992 --> 12:34.169
- Want to eat?
- Nah.

12:34.294 --> 12:37.337
- Want to do anything?
- Not really.

12:37.462 --> 12:39.342
- I'm cool, Vin.
- Come on, Turtle.

12:39.564 --> 12:41.007
I'll cheer you up.

12:41.132 --> 12:43.009
You know, I don't even
know if I'm more upset

12:43.134 --> 12:45.944
about losing my girl
or losing what I do.

12:46.069 --> 12:48.146
I know Alex
probably wasn't the one,

12:48.271 --> 12:49.814
but avion was supposed
to be my thing.

12:49.939 --> 12:51.481
You'll find another thing.

12:51.606 --> 12:53.064
Come on, what do you
want to do?

12:53.230 --> 12:54.649
Come on, Vin.
You know I want my own business.

12:54.876 --> 12:56.753
Do you have any ideas?

12:56.878 --> 12:58.821
Actually, I do.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.689
I'm listening.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.815
When's the last time
you had great baked clams?

13:04.217 --> 13:06.786
- Don Peppe's.
- I want to bring them out here,

13:07.020 --> 13:10.097
get some of the Yanks and the Knicks
who eat there involved.

13:10.222 --> 13:12.399
- That's a great idea.
- Yeah, I already spoke to them about it.

13:12.524 --> 13:14.534
- All they need is the money.
- Do you have the money?

13:14.659 --> 13:16.629
If I sell my stock
in avion I'd have some.

13:16.894 --> 13:18.770
- I'll sell too.
- Really?

13:18.895 --> 13:22.373
Yeah, I can't really be involved
in a liquor company right now anyway.

13:22.498 --> 13:24.387
I'll help with the restaurant too.

13:24.553 --> 13:27.014
Whatever I do, Vin,
I want to do on my own.

13:27.180 --> 13:29.976
Understood.
You'll be fine, Turtle.

13:30.204 --> 13:32.281
I'm proud of you.

13:32.406 --> 13:34.616
Wait till I'm successful
before you say that.

13:34.741 --> 13:37.275
Either way I'm proud.
Hello?

13:37.441 --> 13:39.286
- Hey, it's Carl.
- <i>Hey, Carl.</i>

13:39.411 --> 13:40.855
How you doing?
Listen, I just had

13:40.980 --> 13:43.072
non-alcoholic drinks
with Les Moonves.

13:43.238 --> 13:45.366
- Yeah?
- <i>CBS is in.</i>

13:45.532 --> 13:47.528
- Really?
- <i>Really, baby.</i>

13:47.653 --> 13:50.530
- You told them about Johnny?
- Vince, they're all in.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.365
- They're all in.
- I can't believe it.

13:52.490 --> 13:52.915
Believe it.

13:53.081 --> 13:55.068
Let's get together tomorrow
and talk details.

13:55.193 --> 13:56.302
- Sound good?
- Sounds great.

13:56.427 --> 13:58.628
<i>All right, have a good night.</i>

13:59.930 --> 14:02.741
Wow, I cannot believe
Andrew Dice Clay lives here.

14:02.866 --> 14:05.309
- I can't believe anyone lives here.
- Don't make fun of the place.

14:05.434 --> 14:08.379
Dice sort of fancies himself
an interior decorator.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.228
<i>What, you don't like the music?
Call the cops.</i>

14:14.394 --> 14:17.285
Dice, it's Drama!
Open up!

14:17.410 --> 14:19.453
- <i>What?</i>
- It's Drama.

14:19.578 --> 14:20.943
- <i>Drama?</i>
- Yeah.

14:21.109 --> 14:23.624
- Look at this, a house call.
- Hey.

14:23.749 --> 14:25.907
- What's up, Dice?
- You tell me. Come on in.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.628
Come on.

14:27.753 --> 14:29.930
How's it going?
Excuse the noise.

14:30.055 --> 14:32.432
My son Max just joined a new band.
He's got to practice.

14:32.557 --> 14:35.168
- He sounds good.
- Yeah, all right, great. Let's cut to it.

14:35.293 --> 14:38.237
So where are we in terms of
getting us paid properly?

14:38.362 --> 14:39.879
Uh, well, it's not happening.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.407
- Oh, it's not?
- <i>No.</i>

14:41.532 --> 14:43.709
- Who said?
- We spoke to Phil.

14:43.834 --> 14:45.810
Did you tell Phil
it is happening

14:45.935 --> 14:48.262
or that his little
monkey show isn't happening?

14:48.537 --> 14:51.315
- Did you tell him that?
- No, we didn't really get to that part.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.049
Oh no?
Why not?

14:53.174 --> 14:56.229
You know, as a manager,
sometimes we have to go on our instincts.

14:56.395 --> 14:59.524
- And after talking to Phil--
- After talking to Phil what?

14:59.747 --> 15:02.090
After talking to Phil
we think it's a bad idea, Dice.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.737
Oh yeah? And what about you, Drama?
What do you think?

15:04.903 --> 15:08.199
- Well...
- Well what? You going pussy soft on me?

15:08.365 --> 15:12.286
No, I'm not going pussy soft.

15:12.452 --> 15:14.034
No one's going sof-- there any way

15:14.159 --> 15:15.902
that we can ask him to stop
the drums just for a second?

15:16.027 --> 15:17.708
Didn't I say he's got to practice?

15:17.874 --> 15:20.472
- <i>Didn't I say that?</i>
- It's okay, dad, I'm done.

15:20.597 --> 15:22.574
- Don't be done on their account.
- No, it's all good.

15:22.699 --> 15:23.640
All right, do me a favor.

15:23.765 --> 15:25.910
Why don't you grab us
something to eat, okay?

15:26.035 --> 15:28.011
- Okay.
- Come here. I love you.

15:28.136 --> 15:30.413
- I'm coming right back, dad.
- All right, go ahead.

15:30.538 --> 15:32.806
Yeah, go ahead.

15:34.341 --> 15:37.853
You have no idea what I've gone through
to raise my boys

15:37.978 --> 15:41.155
with fucking courtrooms
and mediators

15:41.280 --> 15:44.777
and fucking attorneys
sucking the life out-- fuck!

15:44.943 --> 15:46.261
Yeah, I know.
It's tough.

15:46.386 --> 15:48.229
Yeah, it's tough.
But so am I.

15:48.354 --> 15:50.398
And I've been thinking
about this for three days.

15:50.523 --> 15:52.400
And if they're not paying,
I'm walking.

15:52.525 --> 15:55.121
- What about you?
- Dice.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.332
A lot harder decision considering you're
getting what, double what I'm making?

15:58.498 --> 15:59.974
I didn't make this deal.

16:00.099 --> 16:03.111
What do I look like,
a fucking asshole to you, huh?

16:03.236 --> 16:05.580
You wear a viking hat,
I sell out the garden

16:05.705 --> 16:08.149
and win Grammys and you get
twice the fucking dough?

16:08.274 --> 16:11.252
- He's not getting twice the dough.
- I'm not?

16:11.377 --> 16:14.421
Bottom line is
we're both underpaid.

16:14.546 --> 16:16.434
I spoke to homer
fucking Simpson.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.159
- Dice, the show hasn't even aired yet.
- Doesn't matter.

16:19.284 --> 16:21.594
It's a hit.
I know it and they know it.

16:21.719 --> 16:23.482
And when the show's a hit
we'll all renegotiate.

16:23.648 --> 16:25.999
After what?
After they make millions

16:26.124 --> 16:27.695
off the fucking
monkey merchandise?

16:27.861 --> 16:30.990
- I say we move now. I'm telling you.
- Well, I disagree.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.739
Good thing is you passed
me on to him,

16:32.864 --> 16:34.507
so I don't care what you think.

16:34.785 --> 16:37.038
- I disagree too.
- Oh really? Then you're fired.

16:37.204 --> 16:40.147
- Come on, man.
- No no, didn't I tell you in your office?

16:40.272 --> 16:43.252
Nobody fucks with Dice.
Dice does the fucking.

16:43.418 --> 16:45.252
We just need you to think
about the big picture.

16:45.377 --> 16:47.588
- We need you to think long term.
- Long term?

16:47.713 --> 16:50.225
Let me tell you something,
I was starring in movies

16:50.350 --> 16:52.678
while you were still sitting on the bottom
of your daddy's nutsack.

16:52.844 --> 16:55.931
Look, Dice, the bottom line
is they're gonna fire you if you do this.

16:56.156 --> 16:57.565
Both of us?

16:57.690 --> 16:59.935
Well, he's not doing it
so he's not gonna get fired.

17:00.101 --> 17:02.021
Oh, he's not doing it?
What, are you gonna go against me, Drama?

17:02.261 --> 17:05.106
- I got you this job.
- I know, and I appreciate it.

17:05.231 --> 17:08.611
But unlike you, I don't know
if a cartoon is gonna resurrect my career.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.912
- Come on, Dice.
- No. You know what?

17:11.037 --> 17:12.613
Let me know what you're doing,

17:12.738 --> 17:16.242
and I'll personally let
fucking Phil know what the fuck I'm doing.

17:16.409 --> 17:18.537
That's it, seriously.
You guys got to go.

17:18.703 --> 17:20.252
This kind of tension
upsets my cat.

17:20.377 --> 17:21.944
<i>Really, come on.</i>

17:27.551 --> 17:30.897
- You want to come up?
- Uh, I guess, yeah.

17:31.022 --> 17:32.218
I don't know.
Do you want me to?

17:32.384 --> 17:35.424
- Yeah, I want you to.
- Okay.

17:41.196 --> 17:42.963
Do you have a condom?

17:44.231 --> 17:48.065
I haven't used one
since the mid-'80s.

17:49.033 --> 17:50.976
I don't think I have any.

17:51.101 --> 17:52.510
Oh, that's not good.

17:52.635 --> 17:54.144
We could go to 7-11.

17:54.269 --> 17:56.713
Or no, I'll just
ask my roommate.

17:56.838 --> 17:59.047
You have a roommate?

17:59.172 --> 18:01.982
Yeah, but he won't care
if I take one.

18:02.107 --> 18:04.917
That's good.
Okay, is he home?

18:05.083 --> 18:07.053
- Yes.
- All right.

18:07.178 --> 18:11.048
Which is why you're going to
have to fuck me very quietly.

18:11.214 --> 18:12.633
- What the fuck?!

18:12.799 --> 18:14.301
<i>Donnie!</i>

18:14.467 --> 18:15.895
Oh my God, Katie.

18:16.020 --> 18:19.056
- I scared the shit out of you.
- Yeah, so not funny.

18:19.222 --> 18:21.266
- How you doing?
- Okay.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.268
Okay.

18:23.393 --> 18:26.570
- I'm going out.
- <i>Is your door open?</i>

18:26.695 --> 18:28.839
Yeah, but don't even think

18:28.964 --> 18:30.573
about ripping another
condom from me.

18:30.698 --> 18:33.932
Seriously.
Later, dude.

18:37.170 --> 18:40.661
- <i>Come on.</i>
- You know, I'm gonna go.

18:40.827 --> 18:42.913
- No, really?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

18:43.079 --> 18:45.458
- I'll call you though.
- Okay.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.053
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

18:47.178 --> 18:48.420
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.321
I had fun.
You're cute.

18:50.446 --> 18:51.889
You'll get your groove back.

18:52.014 --> 18:54.081
- Stella did, right?
- Who?

18:55.016 --> 18:56.552
It doesn't matter.

18:56.718 --> 18:59.250
- Call me.
- Okay.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.963
<i>♪ She moves me, man ♪</i>

19:17.331 --> 19:20.933
<i>♪ honey, and I don't see
how it's done... ♪</i>

19:27.038 --> 19:29.014
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, I'm sorry to bother you.

19:29.139 --> 19:31.982
I'm feeling lonely and I didn't know
who else to call.

19:32.107 --> 19:35.083
<i>Any chance you're not busy
and want to see me?</i>

19:35.208 --> 19:37.843
- Oh, Ari.
- Listen, only if you're bored.

19:38.009 --> 19:40.121
- Are you drunk?
- <i>No, I'm lonely.</i>

19:40.246 --> 19:43.265
<i>And I just wanted someone
smart and mature to talk to</i>

19:43.431 --> 19:45.267
and Warren Buffet
wouldn't take my call.

19:49.220 --> 19:50.648
Come to my house for a drink.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.797
<i>But just a drink.</i>

19:52.922 --> 19:54.819
Don't worry, Dana,
I don't even have a condom.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.233
That's great, Ari.

19:57.654 --> 19:59.949
- I'll see you soon.
- <i>♪ well, I'm a king bee ♪</i>

20:02.095 --> 20:05.097
<i>♪ Buzzin' around
your hive ♪</i>

20:08.734 --> 20:10.610
<i>Hey, Vince, I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.</i>

20:10.735 --> 20:13.177
- <i>I'll be down in a minute.</i>
- It's okay. I'm good.

20:13.302 --> 20:15.912
I do have to get
going soon though.

20:16.037 --> 20:17.680
<i>30 seconds.</i>

20:17.805 --> 20:19.381
I'm just looking to do
my own thing, Mark.

20:19.506 --> 20:21.549
I've got to tell you,
it would really hurt to lose you, Turtle.

20:21.674 --> 20:23.264
You've been a tremendous
asset to this company.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.516
- You think?
- <i>No, not really.</i>

20:25.682 --> 20:28.520
But I like you
and you did bring me avion.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.980
I'd hate for you to miss out
if I take this thing public.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.689
I appreciate that, Mark.

20:32.814 --> 20:35.191
But I got another opportunity and I could
really use the money now.

20:35.316 --> 20:37.659
- How much money do you need?
- <i>It's small, Mark.</i>

20:37.784 --> 20:39.861
- <i>Nothing you'd be interested in.</i>
- Okay, maybe next time.

20:39.986 --> 20:42.395
<i>Anyways, have your guys call my guys,
they'll get you out.</i>

20:42.520 --> 20:44.702
- Thanks.
- You take care of yourself, okay?

20:44.868 --> 20:47.037
Bye.

20:47.203 --> 20:49.582
We're out.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.302
- What did we make?
- I'm gonna make about 300k.

20:52.427 --> 20:54.871
- You're gonna make almost a million.
- Wow.

20:54.996 --> 20:57.740
For doing nothing?
You did good.

20:57.865 --> 21:01.075
Yeah, just have Marvin call Mark's guys
and handle the paperwork and we're done.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.143
Will do.

21:03.268 --> 21:05.097
How much longer are we
gonna sit here, Vin?

21:05.263 --> 21:06.946
Not much longer.

21:07.071 --> 21:09.685
<i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, sorry, man.</i>

21:09.851 --> 21:12.216
There he is.
There he is.

21:12.341 --> 21:13.818
- Carl.
- Boys, I'm sorry.

21:13.943 --> 21:15.754
I'm sorry to keep
you waiting like this.

21:15.879 --> 21:17.923
My daughter, she's at school

21:18.048 --> 21:19.957
at the Lyceum Alpinum
in Switzerland

21:20.082 --> 21:22.891
and the fucking headmaster is talking about
shooting a fucking movie there.

21:23.016 --> 21:23.782
What am I gonna say?

21:23.948 --> 21:25.559
He controls her grade point average
so I listen.

21:25.684 --> 21:27.161
- You know? You know?
- Yeah.

21:27.327 --> 21:29.330
Come on, sit down.
Sit, please, sit.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.731
Welcome.

21:30.856 --> 21:33.400
My assistant found you.
It's awesome.

21:33.525 --> 21:37.087
So are you pumped?

21:37.253 --> 21:39.207
<i>Come on, are you pumped?</i>

21:39.332 --> 21:41.275
I mean we're dream weavers, Vince.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.053
Gonna turn that brother of yours
into the star you always knew he could be.

21:44.219 --> 21:45.970
Yeah, I love it.
So what's next?

21:47.839 --> 21:49.934
- I've got an aside.
- An aside?

21:50.100 --> 21:52.519
An aside.

21:52.644 --> 21:56.106
I did for you,
now will you do for me?

21:56.272 --> 21:58.491
- Do what for you, Carl?
- <i>This is fucking genius, man.</i>

21:58.775 --> 22:01.570
You would be so genius in this.

22:01.736 --> 22:04.732
- Carl, relax.
- I can't when I'm talking art, babe.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.834
I mean wait till you read this fucking thing.
It is fucking brilliant.

22:06.959 --> 22:07.756
You know what it is?

22:07.881 --> 22:09.603
It's the "falling down"
for the next generation.

22:09.728 --> 22:12.472
- <i>Michael fucking Douglas.</i>
- I knew this guy had other motives.

22:12.747 --> 22:15.074
- All right, hold on, Turtle.
- Turtle, just hold on.

22:15.199 --> 22:17.677
- Here.
- "Taxman"?

22:17.802 --> 22:19.380
<i>Yeah man,
motherfucking "Taxman."</i>

22:19.546 --> 22:21.914
I mean it is so now.
Am I right?

22:22.039 --> 22:23.649
I can see
the fucking one sheet.

22:23.774 --> 22:26.418
You, right, you--
you're kind of like towards camera.

22:26.543 --> 22:29.788
Your tie, it's all loose
around your neck.

22:29.913 --> 22:32.991
<i>You got a briefcase in one hand, sawed-off</i>
<i>shotgun in the other.</i>

22:33.268 --> 22:34.993
There's that I.R.S.
Building behind you

22:35.118 --> 22:37.628
with an ominous orange sky
just shining down.

22:37.753 --> 22:41.443
And the tag line reads,
"death. And taxes.

22:41.609 --> 22:44.934
Vincent Chase is the Taxman."

22:45.059 --> 22:47.770
Don't say anything now.
Just read it. It's my gift.

22:48.074 --> 22:49.403
I'll say something.

22:49.528 --> 22:51.424
That's the dumbest fucking idea
I've ever heard.

22:51.549 --> 22:52.675
And more importantly
you're completely full of shit.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.290
- Stop. Stop, I'm serious.
- I've had it with this guy.

22:55.456 --> 22:57.213
Do me a favor,

22:57.338 --> 22:59.586
walk outside for five minutes.

22:59.752 --> 23:01.484
- Take a walk?
- Five minutes.

23:01.609 --> 23:03.877
All right.

23:05.479 --> 23:07.489
- Vince, this is no bullshit.
- Carl.

23:07.614 --> 23:10.392
Carl, is this why you're doing
the thing for my brother?

23:10.517 --> 23:12.370
- To get me to do this?
- Oh, no no.

23:12.495 --> 23:14.675
Please, I'm doing the other thing
because you needed it.

23:14.800 --> 23:15.853
And I need this.

23:16.019 --> 23:18.981
I don't need you to sell a movie of the week
to CBS for me, Carl.

23:19.147 --> 23:21.303
I know.
I know.

23:21.428 --> 23:23.939
I need you.
Oh, fuck me.

23:24.064 --> 23:25.441
This is where I'm at, man.
Fuck.

23:25.566 --> 23:28.077
- Did you take something today?
- No no.

23:28.202 --> 23:29.812
I haven't used
in three fucking years.

23:29.937 --> 23:32.415
You know, I'm sorry.
I'm so fucking sorry, man.

23:32.540 --> 23:34.997
I-I-I-I-- I shouldn't
have done this.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.186
I'm an asshole.
I didn't mean to play you.

23:37.311 --> 23:39.989
I mean I had the script, right,
and I knew you were coming over.

23:40.114 --> 23:42.191
I thought you might--
fuck. Fuck!

23:42.316 --> 23:43.892
Come on, Carl.
Are you high?

23:44.017 --> 23:46.795
Yeah, I'm fucking high.
Fuck yeah, I'm high.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.396
Fuck yeah.
What are you gonna do?

23:48.521 --> 23:50.831
You gonna fucking judge me?
You gonna rat me out?

23:50.956 --> 23:54.349
Call my fucking sponsor.
Go ahead, call my fucking sponsor.

23:54.515 --> 23:56.568
- Carl, let's sit down.
- No, get the fuck out of my house.

23:56.693 --> 23:59.104
- Carl.
- Out of my house. I'm sorry.

23:59.229 --> 24:01.506
I don't fucking mean that.
Just take a seat, man.

24:01.631 --> 24:03.173
I'm sitting.
I'm right here, Carl.

24:03.441 --> 24:06.542
I'm gonna go--
I'm gonna go now

24:06.667 --> 24:08.710
and just clean up a little bit.

24:08.835 --> 24:10.712
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- Okay.

24:10.837 --> 24:12.438
I'll be right here.

24:14.661 --> 24:17.152
- Vince, what the fuck?
- Turtle, you go.

24:17.277 --> 24:19.921
We both should go.
The guy's high as a kite.

24:20.046 --> 24:22.156
I know, that's why I can't
just leave him right now.

24:22.281 --> 24:24.505
- You go.
- Fuck that.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.584
If you're staying, I'm staying.

24:29.217 --> 24:31.231
Carl Ertz?
And he doesn't tell me?

24:31.356 --> 24:33.466
Well, he didn't think it was gonna amount
to too much anyway.

24:33.591 --> 24:35.902
He didn't want you giving
him a hard time about it.

24:36.027 --> 24:37.460
That's great.

24:38.561 --> 24:41.739
- You hear from Dice?
- Yeah.

24:41.864 --> 24:43.608
Yeah, I sure did.
He's not coming.

24:43.898 --> 24:46.693
- This guy's insane.
- So what do we do?

24:46.859 --> 24:49.321
I already replaced him.

24:49.487 --> 24:50.804
You're kidding.
With who?

24:52.507 --> 24:54.450
- Him.
- Who's he?

24:54.575 --> 24:56.419
He's a guy who sucks,

24:56.703 --> 24:58.854
who was forced down my throat
against my wishes.

24:58.979 --> 25:00.555
And he's doing a bad
Dice impression.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.668
He's good.
He's very very good.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.693
He sucks.
And now the show sucks.

25:05.818 --> 25:08.252
And I hate everyone.

25:10.321 --> 25:11.998
You sure this is
the right move, Phil?

25:12.123 --> 25:14.499
Well, you know, Dice couldn't be
convinced to be here.

25:14.624 --> 25:16.834
So it's the only move.

25:16.959 --> 25:18.802
Look out, world.

25:18.927 --> 25:21.339
Here comes the balding
Kentucky fried chicken.

25:21.464 --> 25:23.408
You're pissing me off, Ronald.

25:23.533 --> 25:26.343
- I'm fucked.
- 'Cause you told me our relationship

25:26.468 --> 25:28.211
suffered from a lack
of honesty.

25:28.336 --> 25:30.195
I'm mending fences.
Hey.

25:30.361 --> 25:32.013
What am I gonna do?

25:32.138 --> 25:34.682
Your job.
We'll go from there.

25:34.807 --> 25:36.743
He's right.
Hey, where you going?

25:36.909 --> 25:39.420
I'm gonna call Ari.

25:39.545 --> 25:40.988
<i>Ruffy!</i>

25:41.113 --> 25:43.390
<i>Hey, Johnny,
you start talking dirty</i>

25:43.515 --> 25:45.794
<i>i might have to pay
for the session.</i>

25:45.960 --> 25:47.296
Oh!

25:49.687 --> 25:51.731
I was trying to remember
the last time.

25:51.856 --> 25:53.866
September 1992.

25:53.991 --> 25:55.701
You do not remember.

25:55.826 --> 25:58.236
- Of course I do. Are you kidding me?
- How do you remember?

25:58.361 --> 26:00.804
Because you said it was
go time-- "Marry me or Walk."

26:00.929 --> 26:03.072
And you walked.

26:03.197 --> 26:05.408
I ran if I remember.

26:05.533 --> 26:07.209
But I regretted it.

26:07.482 --> 26:11.279
Well, I'm 40 and not married.

26:11.404 --> 26:14.406
So I guess I regret it too.

26:14.572 --> 26:17.151
Brought back a lot
of good memories.

26:17.276 --> 26:20.787
Yeah, but it's just
a one-time thing.

26:20.912 --> 26:23.213
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:26.650 --> 26:28.393
Mmm.

26:28.518 --> 26:31.429
- Don't you dare get that.

26:31.554 --> 26:33.897
- It's yours.
- Mine?! Oh my God!

26:34.022 --> 26:36.267
- Yeah?

26:36.392 --> 26:39.097
You fucking knew about
Carl Ertz and you didn't tell me?

26:39.263 --> 26:41.892
It was Vince's place
to tell you, not mine.

26:42.058 --> 26:43.207
But you said it was okay.

26:43.332 --> 26:44.811
<i>No I didn't
and it's not.</i>

26:44.977 --> 26:47.110
Got an email last night
from les moonves.

26:47.235 --> 26:49.178
Ertz is basically saying
that Vinnie

26:49.303 --> 26:51.777
will do a small role
if moonves makes the movie.

26:51.943 --> 26:53.115
So did you call Vince?

26:53.403 --> 26:55.851
I've been stuck in meetings.

26:55.976 --> 26:59.020
Oh, that's great, Ari.
'Cause he's at Ertz's right now.

26:59.145 --> 27:02.120
- <i>I'll call him.</i>
- Fuck that, I'll call him.

27:05.918 --> 27:08.962
Carl, open the fucking door.

27:11.756 --> 27:14.091
Oh!

27:15.760 --> 27:18.037
I fucked up, Vince.

27:18.162 --> 27:20.472
I'm sorry, man.
I fucked up, you know?

27:20.597 --> 27:23.600
<i>I fucked you today.
And I fucked my wife.</i>

27:23.766 --> 27:25.643
Well, I didn't fuck my wife

27:25.768 --> 27:27.896
'cause she won't let me
fuck her, you know, but...

27:28.062 --> 27:31.915
<i>My kids and the program...</i>

27:32.040 --> 27:33.950
Just go away.
I'm not worth it.

27:34.075 --> 27:36.452
I'm not worth it, man.

27:36.737 --> 27:39.054
You didn't fuck me, Carl.
Come on.

27:39.179 --> 27:41.590
Just open the door, come out
and we'll talk about it.

27:41.715 --> 27:43.658
No, can't look you
in the face, Vince.

27:43.783 --> 27:45.927
I can't look you in the face!

27:46.205 --> 27:48.395
I can't look myself
in the face.

27:48.666 --> 27:49.897
Carl.

27:50.022 --> 27:51.766
<i>Vinnie, just go.
Just go.</i>

27:54.693 --> 27:56.070
E, I can't talk right now.

27:56.195 --> 27:58.302
Do you not want me
to be your manager anymore?

27:58.468 --> 28:00.573
- What?
- You're taking meetings with lowlife

28:00.698 --> 28:02.776
fucking scumbag producers
and you don't tell me?

28:03.055 --> 28:04.711
E, I can't deal
with this right now.

28:04.836 --> 28:06.246
<i>What, you're still there?</i>

28:06.371 --> 28:07.881
Yeah, I'm dealing with
something but it's all good.

28:08.006 --> 28:10.016
No, it's not all good,
Vince, all right?

28:10.141 --> 28:12.818
The guy's a crackpot.
Do you know that moonves just emailed Ari

28:12.943 --> 28:14.520
Ertz told him you're gonna
do a role in a movie?

28:14.645 --> 28:17.455
- Jesus.
- <i>Yeah, get the fuck out of there.</i>

28:17.580 --> 28:19.123
I can't just
leave him like this.

28:19.248 --> 28:21.058
Vin, we should go.
Come on, this is nuts.

28:21.183 --> 28:22.826
E, hold on.
Carl, come on.

28:22.951 --> 28:26.228
Open the door. Seriously, come on.
I can't leave you like this.

28:26.353 --> 28:28.248
All right, now you're
being selfish.

28:30.917 --> 28:32.085
Carl.

28:34.754 --> 28:36.862
Carl!

28:38.364 --> 28:39.926
- Whoa!

28:40.092 --> 28:41.636
What the fuck was that?

28:43.167 --> 28:45.578
- Oh my God.
- <i>Vince.</i>

28:45.703 --> 28:48.268
<i>Vince!</i>

28:48.434 --> 28:49.519
Vince!
