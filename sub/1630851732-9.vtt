00:11.011 --> 00:12.471
You sure that's your key?

00:12.513 --> 00:13.972
It is! It's…

00:14.306 --> 00:16.433
Then open it.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.354
You ok?

00:28.320 --> 00:29.404
Nice.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.241
I like your place.

00:32.950 --> 00:37.496
It's just an apartment. I only sleep here.

00:40.749 --> 00:41.834
David Bowie.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.211
Makes sense.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.171
You like him?

00:48.131 --> 00:49.299
Bowie?

00:51.885 --> 00:53.971
Yeah, I like him.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.598
How's it "makes sense?"

00:58.350 --> 00:59.476
Because…

01:00.519 --> 01:02.563
You're like him.

01:06.692 --> 01:09.486
No one's like Bowie.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.029
You are.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.658
You have cool hair. You wear cool clothes.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.870
You're more talented
than anyone I've ever met.

01:19.746 --> 01:20.998
But I think…

01:22.082 --> 01:24.418
You think you aren't good enough.

01:28.255 --> 01:31.550
You think you know me?

01:34.469 --> 01:37.306
You're right. You aren't Bowie.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.980
He's an alien.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.775
You're space.

01:50.235 --> 01:57.910
From where everyone stands,
you look distant, cold, empty…

01:58.577 --> 01:59.786
Empty?

02:03.207 --> 02:04.875
Unreachable.

02:06.210 --> 02:10.005
Good thing I'm an astronaut.

02:11.757 --> 02:14.218
I'm not afraid to go out there.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.595
Because I see you.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.473
You're full of stars.

02:20.557 --> 02:27.272
Like the sun. You make my skin warm
when I get close to you.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.735
You aren't cold.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.906
You're burning.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.036
I'm like space?

02:43.497 --> 02:46.083
I've always been into space.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.963
In space,
you never run out of things to discover.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.258
Like stars.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.596
You know…

02:59.972 --> 03:04.184
Stars are just ultra-massive balls of gas.

03:05.227 --> 03:06.770
That's okay.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.357
I know a personal trainer
I can introduce you to.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.414
Look! Everyone is walking.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.417
Kids are cute.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.586
And this is a tree. See?

04:55.212 --> 04:57.047
It's about to bloom, isn't it?

04:57.923 --> 05:00.008
And the grass.

05:02.427 --> 05:06.348
The sun is up in the sky.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.434
It's fun to walk, isn't it?

05:10.102 --> 05:12.229
Walk and talk.

05:13.105 --> 05:14.231
See?

05:14.273 --> 05:18.569
The sun is up high in the sky
and shining brightly.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.445
Look, look, this.

05:23.866 --> 05:26.535
Wake up already!

05:26.577 --> 05:29.580
I'll get pissed!

05:30.914 --> 05:32.541
I'll come to you!

05:53.979 --> 05:55.480
Wajo.

05:58.859 --> 05:59.860
Wajo.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.122
Wajo.

06:14.917 --> 06:15.918
Wajo.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.238
Hinata?

06:52.037 --> 06:53.121
Hinata?

06:53.205 --> 06:55.207
Can you hear me?

06:58.752 --> 06:59.753
Mitsuki?

06:59.837 --> 07:01.004
Hinata?

08:15.495 --> 08:18.040
Hey, I need a doctor.
Are you a doctor? No?

08:18.123 --> 08:19.750
Hey! Hey!

08:19.833 --> 08:22.878
-Sir, hi. Are you a doctor?
-You can't barge in here.

08:22.961 --> 08:26.006
-Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor?
-We've got contamination. Hey!

08:26.089 --> 08:28.091
-I'm a US Navy SEAL. High military shit.
-Wait!

08:28.175 --> 08:30.385
-This is military stuff.
-Mum!

08:36.350 --> 08:37.893
Is this your mum's spot?

08:39.477 --> 08:43.357
Neurology, code blue, station one.
Neurology, code blue, station one.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.858
What's that?

08:44.942 --> 08:46.401
Emergency, innit?

08:48.946 --> 08:50.447
Who called blue?

08:50.531 --> 08:51.949
You a neurologist?

08:52.032 --> 08:54.993
Is this a prank?
We've people fighting for life here.

08:55.077 --> 08:56.787
No. Look, I need help. Okay? I need--

08:56.870 --> 08:58.872
You need to find your parent or guardian.

08:58.956 --> 09:01.083
I'll have someone get you out of here.

09:04.545 --> 09:05.754
I'm his guardian.

09:08.507 --> 09:09.508
You a neurologist?

09:11.093 --> 09:12.094
Yeah.

09:23.814 --> 09:24.940
Dilation is normal.

09:28.360 --> 09:32.155
Look, I can't just induce a seizure
in a child without a parent's consent.

09:32.990 --> 09:33.991
He drew this.

09:36.118 --> 09:38.620
All right? Before it even happened.

09:39.204 --> 09:42.082
Look, I can help them,
all of them, all right?

09:42.165 --> 09:44.668
I just need a seizure. Okay, but--

09:44.751 --> 09:46.879
There are enough people
with real injuries here.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.506
You should be taking medication
to avoid epilepsy.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.842
Carbamazepine.
Two hundred milligrams a day, okay?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.927
I don't need meds. I need to see.

09:54.011 --> 09:56.930
I can't induce a seizure in a child
without a medical reason. I won't.

09:57.681 --> 09:58.682
We got a gun.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.977
-That medical enough?
-Ma'am.

10:03.187 --> 10:04.688
You gonna shoot me?

10:06.940 --> 10:09.443
I've seen doctors induce
all kinds of shit on kids before.

10:10.402 --> 10:11.403
Tests, procedures.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.742
Hell, I've seen 'em do it when kids
are screaming and crying for them not to.

10:16.825 --> 10:19.036
When those tests
and procedures don't-- Look at me.

10:22.039 --> 10:25.792
So, please, spare us all
the medical reason bullshit.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.671
He's asking for help.

10:31.465 --> 10:32.466
I'm asking.

10:34.593 --> 10:35.969
'Cause I can't be here,

10:36.053 --> 10:39.515
all the way across the world,
to be back here again for nothing.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.141
'Cause there has to be a reason.

10:45.729 --> 10:46.772
He's the reason.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.233
That book is the reason.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.197
So do whatever he needs.

10:59.284 --> 11:02.162
Control survives acid bath.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.375
Regenerating now.

11:08.460 --> 11:09.795
Test the object now.

11:10.546 --> 11:11.964
Bring her close, please.

11:21.682 --> 11:22.683
There.

11:26.937 --> 11:29.898
Okay, PSI is stable.

11:32.276 --> 11:37.155
Replication and ammonia discharge
has completely ceased.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.118
Dousing the sample.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.163
Trying hydrochloride.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.422
Whoa.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.885
Total structural disintegration.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.018
We can kill it.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.772
I think it can save
more than just my family.

12:11.440 --> 12:15.068
Armed escort,
classified Yankee White, TS/SCI vanguard.

12:15.152 --> 12:17.529
Miss Malik, thank you. We'll collect
your belongings and your family.

12:17.613 --> 12:20.073
-Collect?
-I want transport in under 30.

12:20.157 --> 12:21.658
-Wait, what transport?
-Full squad.

12:21.742 --> 12:24.453
Ma'am, you say your son found this.
You killed one of them with it.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.496
We don't know how it works,
just that it does.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.708
For all we know, you or your family
is the key to this.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.335
You wanna help? Get your kids.

12:34.213 --> 12:37.007
-But where are we going now?
-To the Pentagon, sweetie.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.009
What's the Pentagon?

12:39.092 --> 12:41.678
-It's a--
-It's a very big, very safe house.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.597
Do they have toys?

12:43.680 --> 12:46.350
Yes, very, very expensive toys.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.965
Oh, my God. Come on.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.604
Hinata.

13:32.688 --> 13:34.398
Are you in the capsule?

13:34.857 --> 13:36.900
Are manual controls online?

13:40.070 --> 13:41.071
Hinata?

13:42.614 --> 13:44.616
If manual is online,

13:44.658 --> 13:46.827
we can get backup systems working.

13:48.203 --> 13:49.746
Don't…

13:51.748 --> 13:54.251
…Hurt…

13:56.461 --> 13:58.005
…Help…

13:58.046 --> 13:59.339
Tell me how.

14:09.391 --> 14:10.184
Help…

14:10.225 --> 14:11.560
us…

14:14.813 --> 14:16.982
-Who's "us"?
-Our crew.

14:18.066 --> 14:22.613
Your crew is dead.
The enemy have full net superiority.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.451
My contact with US command

14:27.534 --> 14:31.038
is hanging by a thread
of enemy-jammed radio wire.

14:31.121 --> 14:34.208
They scramble our comms,
and now they say, "Help us"?

14:34.750 --> 14:36.335
What do you think that means?

14:43.884 --> 14:47.012
I don't want her
negotiating on behalf of all mankind.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.764
She's talking to our astronaut.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.098
And you know that?

14:51.642 --> 14:55.395
-She made contact when you could not.
-How do you know what she's talking to?

15:00.067 --> 15:02.444
He does not want to remove her now.
We could lose contact.

15:02.528 --> 15:04.613
We cannot lose contact.

15:04.696 --> 15:08.700
That signal is giving us the clearest
target we have for missile defense.

15:12.371 --> 15:13.997
You're going to nuke them?

15:15.249 --> 15:17.876
As of now, we still have
our nuclear defense grid

15:17.960 --> 15:19.336
and may not have it by dawn.

15:19.419 --> 15:24.258
So yes, unless she can make peace
in the next 78 minutes,

15:25.634 --> 15:26.718
we strike.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.813
General.
You're right, that isn't their astronaut.

15:39.356 --> 15:40.357
Gaps.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.235
They don't match breathing patterns.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.654
Look. This pause here,

15:47.114 --> 15:51.076
there's no space for inhale without
affecting vocal rhythm, without sibilance.

15:58.584 --> 16:00.085
It's synthesized speech.

16:20.898 --> 16:21.982
Murai-san.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.319
You're an audio engineer,

16:25.360 --> 16:27.154
a scientist.

16:27.196 --> 16:29.198
You know sound.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.742
And you know your daughter.

16:32.618 --> 16:35.370
Is that her?

16:37.873 --> 16:39.082
Tell me how to save you.

16:44.129 --> 16:46.215
Help them.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.426
Help.

16:49.885 --> 16:51.303
That's her voice.

16:51.345 --> 16:53.180
It is Captain Murai's voice.

16:53.931 --> 16:55.098
But?

16:56.099 --> 16:57.142
But…

16:57.935 --> 16:59.520
She isn't breathing.

17:04.525 --> 17:06.527
But she isn't breathing.

17:06.609 --> 17:07.653
That's not her.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.030
It's pretending to be.

17:30.634 --> 17:31.718
I'll be all right.

17:32.511 --> 17:33.512
I know.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.684
You shou--
You should go look for your mum.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.477
I will.

17:41.854 --> 17:42.855
I mean it.

17:44.481 --> 17:45.482
I'm not alone.

17:46.275 --> 17:47.693
All right.

17:48.443 --> 17:49.862
If you're ready.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.164
Go. Find her.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.166
I'll be right here.

18:33.739 --> 18:35.240
Friendly voice could help.

18:56.011 --> 18:57.095
Hello.

19:00.766 --> 19:02.351
Try to relax and breathe.

19:04.645 --> 19:05.646
Relax?

19:07.189 --> 19:08.607
Thanks, got it.

19:10.776 --> 19:12.653
You've done this before, huh?

19:12.736 --> 19:13.779
Now's different.

19:17.491 --> 19:22.663
Hey, what was that about
"being back here," all that?

19:29.253 --> 19:30.587
Nothing.

19:37.302 --> 19:38.720
Where's your mom?

19:48.897 --> 19:49.982
She's dead.

19:53.610 --> 19:54.862
I'm sorry.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.657
It's fine. You didn't know.

20:02.870 --> 20:04.079
What about your dad?

20:06.832 --> 20:07.833
He's gone.

20:11.587 --> 20:13.088
He left a long time ago.

20:15.465 --> 20:18.719
Maybe if he didn't leave,
Mum would be okay.

20:22.556 --> 20:24.183
If he would have took care of her.

20:30.105 --> 20:31.106
Would he have?

20:32.649 --> 20:34.026
Like, took care of her?

20:41.700 --> 20:44.870
He hurt her, and then he left.

20:55.255 --> 20:57.883
Well, you're stronger without him.
All right?

21:03.805 --> 21:04.806
Yeah.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.435
Did something happen to you?

21:10.270 --> 21:11.313
In a hospital?

21:11.980 --> 21:14.399
Before, you said you're never going back.

21:19.112 --> 21:20.405
Are you okay?

21:34.211 --> 21:35.295
My son…

21:38.799 --> 21:40.300
My son, he was born sick.

21:41.051 --> 21:42.219
Yeah, so…

21:43.720 --> 21:45.764
I spent a lot of nights
sleeping in hospitals.

21:49.852 --> 21:51.228
That's all. Yeah.

21:56.942 --> 21:58.402
Hey, what's your name?

22:01.321 --> 22:02.322
Trevante.

22:04.783 --> 22:05.868
I'm Caspar.

22:08.287 --> 22:09.454
Curious Caspar.

22:11.415 --> 22:13.876
Hey. What's up, Caspar.

22:13.959 --> 22:14.960
That's me.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.465
Thanks for bringing me here.

22:25.596 --> 22:26.597
Means a lot.

22:30.684 --> 22:31.685
Yeah.

22:33.979 --> 22:34.980
Caspar?

22:39.693 --> 22:42.988
I want you just to lay
as still as possible.

22:43.071 --> 22:45.782
I'm going to
show you some visual stimulus.

22:54.583 --> 22:56.710
Look directly ahead.

23:30.536 --> 23:32.287
Did you say bye to your friend, Mommy?

23:42.923 --> 23:45.050
Feels like we should each have a .50 cal.

23:46.385 --> 23:49.763
They took out entire platoons,
all New York.

23:55.769 --> 23:56.937
Our house is still there.

23:59.731 --> 24:00.816
Is it really?

24:02.568 --> 24:03.569
Definitely.

24:05.112 --> 24:06.113
Hey.

24:23.005 --> 24:24.214
We got company?

24:28.510 --> 24:29.511
Escort.

24:31.221 --> 24:32.389
Hey, who we got back there?

24:41.064 --> 24:42.691
Hey, who we got back there?

24:49.781 --> 24:50.949
Civvies.

24:51.450 --> 24:52.868
Fuck are they doin'?

24:54.870 --> 24:55.996
They flagging us?

24:56.788 --> 24:58.582
-Shit!
-Down, down, down!

24:59.750 --> 25:02.085
Get down! Down!

25:02.169 --> 25:03.629
What do they want?

25:03.712 --> 25:06.423
-Fuck!
-Down, down, down!

25:10.052 --> 25:11.303
Hit!

25:11.386 --> 25:12.763
-Got 'em.
-On the left!

25:16.016 --> 25:17.059
Fuck, hold on!

25:30.989 --> 25:33.242
-What's happening? Is he all right?
-He's induced.

25:37.246 --> 25:40.040
Whoa, what's that? What's happening?

25:40.123 --> 25:41.124
I don't know.

25:41.708 --> 25:42.709
God.

25:44.503 --> 25:45.504
Caspar?

25:45.587 --> 25:47.214
Caspar? Caspar.

26:01.353 --> 26:02.563
-Caspar.
-Taiyou.

26:03.355 --> 26:05.023
What's he saying? What's going on?
What's happening right now?

26:05.107 --> 26:07.276
-Listen. I don't know.
-You're a doctor. What do you mean?

26:07.359 --> 26:09.862
Brain signals are arrhythmic...

26:09.945 --> 26:11.405
-Wajo.
-...asymmetrical,

26:12.531 --> 26:14.157
even during a grand mal seizure.

26:14.241 --> 26:15.492
But this…

26:15.576 --> 26:18.328
Billions of neurons
moving in perfect sync.

26:19.121 --> 26:21.248
-This is not how a brain works.
-But that's how his works?

26:21.331 --> 26:22.666
No. No, this is something else.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.793
-What do you mean?
-I've never seen anything like this.

26:24.877 --> 26:27.254
-What are you talking about?
-There's never been anything like this.

26:27.337 --> 26:29.214
It's like an overriding signal.

26:31.091 --> 26:32.217
Wajo.

26:32.968 --> 26:34.094
Taiyou.

26:34.178 --> 26:36.430
Mitsuki. Mitsuki.

26:39.349 --> 26:40.934
Mitsuki. Mitsuki.

26:41.018 --> 26:42.019
"Mitsuki."

26:44.188 --> 26:45.480
What does this mean?

26:50.777 --> 26:52.946
-He's seeing what they're seeing.
-Who?

26:54.406 --> 26:55.407
Mitsuki.

26:58.744 --> 26:59.745
Them.

27:07.211 --> 27:08.253
Mitsuki.

27:11.215 --> 27:12.591
Mitsuki.

27:14.259 --> 27:15.469
They're here!

27:27.272 --> 27:28.690
Oh, my God.

27:32.319 --> 27:33.403
It's coming here.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.825
It's coming! It's coming!

27:38.909 --> 27:40.536
-What is that?
-No, no, no.

27:46.959 --> 27:48.919
They're in the building! I see!

27:49.002 --> 27:50.921
-Hold on. Hey, hey, hey, hey!
-I can see!

27:51.004 --> 27:52.005
I can see.

27:53.090 --> 27:54.466
What can you see, kid? Huh?

27:54.550 --> 27:56.552
-It's in the building.
-Lock the door!

27:57.094 --> 27:59.388
-Get down. Get down.
-Jam, she's out there.

27:59.471 --> 28:01.473
-No. Get off me!
-Hey, come on.

28:01.557 --> 28:03.851
-Get down. Hey. Get down.
-Get off me! Jam!

28:03.934 --> 28:05.477
-Jam!
-Shut up. Shut up!

28:05.561 --> 28:07.020
Hey, shut up. Look at me!

28:07.104 --> 28:08.856
Hey, shut up. I'm here to protect you.

28:08.939 --> 28:12.192
-No, protect her too!
-I will, all right? Just be quiet.

28:19.032 --> 28:20.826
It's coming here.

28:20.909 --> 28:21.952
Hey, hey, hey.

28:25.831 --> 28:27.499
Hey, hey, hey.

28:27.583 --> 28:28.667
Hey, hey. Hey.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.335
They're here! They're downstairs.

28:30.836 --> 28:32.212
It's downstairs.

28:32.296 --> 28:34.798
We've still got time to save her.
Go, go, now. Now! Come on.

28:38.886 --> 28:41.930
Ma'am? Ma'am. Be careful.

28:42.639 --> 28:44.850
-Hey. Are you okay?
-Everyone okay?

28:44.933 --> 28:46.268
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

29:03.869 --> 29:04.786
Go!

29:05.370 --> 29:07.497
Man down! Man down!

29:22.804 --> 29:23.805
There you go.

29:32.231 --> 29:33.941
Aneesha! Come. Come.

29:36.235 --> 29:37.236
Run!

29:51.375 --> 29:52.376
Casp!

29:53.377 --> 29:54.378
Caspar!

29:56.880 --> 29:59.591
Please, let me in. Let me in!

30:05.639 --> 30:09.226
Jam! Jam. I was looking for you.

30:10.227 --> 30:11.353
I was looking for you.

30:11.436 --> 30:12.479
I'm here.

30:15.440 --> 30:16.483
Caspar!

30:17.317 --> 30:19.570
It's coming here. Right here, right now.

30:19.653 --> 30:20.863
-Right here?
-Yeah.

30:21.363 --> 30:22.573
Elevator. It's in the elevator!

30:24.241 --> 30:27.578
On my back, now. On my back, now.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

30:30.789 --> 30:31.790
Shit.

30:31.874 --> 30:33.083
Stop, stop.

30:34.501 --> 30:35.502
It's down there.

30:35.586 --> 30:36.920
You said the elevator.

30:42.426 --> 30:43.510
There's more than one.

30:43.594 --> 30:44.636
What?

30:51.059 --> 30:52.060
Come on, come on.

31:01.945 --> 31:03.488
Hinata? Hinata.

31:06.283 --> 31:07.826
Hinata.

31:19.087 --> 31:20.714
You cut me off!

31:20.756 --> 31:21.798
She could die!

31:21.840 --> 31:22.841
Everyone could die!

31:22.883 --> 31:24.218
That isn't Captain Murai!

31:24.259 --> 31:25.511
You don't know her!

31:25.802 --> 31:27.429
I know her.

31:27.971 --> 31:29.181
You don't know her.

31:29.223 --> 31:32.392
Let me talk to her.

31:32.684 --> 31:33.769
Not her.

31:34.937 --> 31:35.938
The enemy.

31:36.772 --> 31:37.814
If you think it's "them,"

31:37.856 --> 31:39.775
let me talk to them!

31:39.816 --> 31:41.902
Why cut off contact?

31:49.743 --> 31:51.286
Where's the American?

31:52.329 --> 31:54.915
Readying the counterattack.

31:56.458 --> 31:57.626
You fucking idiots!

31:58.210 --> 31:59.837
We have less than an hour.

32:04.842 --> 32:06.593
She's telling us not to attack!

32:06.635 --> 32:08.303
Why don't you get it?

32:08.720 --> 32:09.805
You'll kill her!

32:09.847 --> 32:10.973
You could start a war!

32:11.014 --> 32:12.266
Start?

32:12.307 --> 32:13.851
Entire cities are falling.

32:14.393 --> 32:16.186
People are dying.

32:16.228 --> 32:18.814
They are changing our atmosphere
to poison.

32:19.731 --> 32:21.525
That isn't Captain Murai.

32:25.362 --> 32:26.947
It isn't human.

32:30.284 --> 32:31.493
It's synthetic.

32:35.622 --> 32:38.250
You're a communications specialist.
I know you can see.

32:47.801 --> 32:49.636
It's her.

32:53.348 --> 32:56.143
If that is Captain Murai,

32:57.603 --> 33:00.439
then the only way she's still alive…

33:00.480 --> 33:03.609
is if she's in another craft.

33:03.650 --> 33:05.360
In one of theirs.

33:06.278 --> 33:09.364
We have someone on the inside.

33:09.698 --> 33:16.288
She could tell us about their defenses.

33:17.164 --> 33:21.251
If that were true, we'd have to prove
it's her. Beyond any doubt.

33:21.293 --> 33:23.420
There's no way we can do that here.

33:23.462 --> 33:24.004
I can.

33:28.091 --> 33:29.426
How?

33:29.468 --> 33:31.470
Turn it back on.

33:44.107 --> 33:45.400
Come on, Sarah.

33:56.662 --> 33:58.413
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:00.332 --> 34:01.333
Hey.

34:02.501 --> 34:03.502
It's stopped.

34:06.421 --> 34:07.464
It's stopped.

34:11.301 --> 34:12.553
Go to Mommy.

34:20.601 --> 34:23.480
-They wanna kill us.
-No, no one wants to kill us.

34:26.275 --> 34:27.525
I told him about it.

34:28.527 --> 34:29.610
No, I did.

34:30.696 --> 34:31.697
Lady!

34:32.864 --> 34:34.491
-Hey.
-Coming from over there.

34:35.868 --> 34:38.661
Lady! It's okay!

34:38.745 --> 34:39.788
I'm scared.

34:39.871 --> 34:42.081
Don't be scared. It's okay. I'm here.

34:43.041 --> 34:44.126
Lady!

34:44.626 --> 34:48.672
Hey, Sarah, we're just in the woods.

34:49.464 --> 34:51.550
Now, remember when we found Luke?

34:51.632 --> 34:52.634
Yeah.

34:52.967 --> 34:54.303
-They'll find us.
-No.

34:54.386 --> 34:55.512
No, no, no.

34:55.596 --> 35:00.684
Remember, you were scared,
but we found that nice warm house, right?

35:01.268 --> 35:02.269
Yeah.

35:02.352 --> 35:03.604
But the monster came.

35:03.687 --> 35:05.981
Hey, I killed the monster.

35:06.064 --> 35:07.566
Lady, it's okay!

35:07.649 --> 35:09.276
-Shit.
-Over here.

35:10.110 --> 35:11.111
Lady!

35:14.615 --> 35:16.992
Lady! It's okay!

35:19.036 --> 35:20.162
You can come out!

35:27.377 --> 35:29.379
Go ahead. Take them.

35:30.756 --> 35:32.007
Dad, we can be quiet.

35:32.090 --> 35:34.635
No, it's okay. You three go and I'll…

35:36.345 --> 35:38.472
-I'll talk to them.
-You can't talk to them.

35:38.555 --> 35:42.017
-What if they--
-Nothing bad will happen, okay?

35:45.145 --> 35:46.146
Go.

35:47.648 --> 35:48.649
Go.

35:48.732 --> 35:49.775
Go.

35:50.359 --> 35:51.860
Come on, Aneesha, go!

35:52.444 --> 35:54.279
Just go. Go, go, go.

35:54.863 --> 35:56.156
Go, go.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.491
-Daddy!
-Dad!

35:58.575 --> 35:59.743
No!

36:01.370 --> 36:02.788
Lady, it's okay!

36:05.999 --> 36:07.000
You can come out!

36:45.372 --> 36:46.373
It's okay.

36:50.627 --> 36:52.963
Stop! Stop, stop, stop. Ahead.

36:53.964 --> 36:54.965
Where?

37:11.023 --> 37:12.107
Back up.

37:12.191 --> 37:13.775
Back up, back up, back up.

37:15.110 --> 37:16.236
They know I'm here.

37:16.904 --> 37:18.155
-They know I'm here.
-How?

38:22.845 --> 38:24.221
They're coming for me.

38:25.556 --> 38:26.974
They're coming for me.

38:35.858 --> 38:37.651
Go! Go, go, go, go.

38:43.824 --> 38:44.825
Let's go.

39:03.051 --> 39:04.052
Caspar!

39:04.136 --> 39:06.388
Let's go. Go inside. Open the door!

39:11.143 --> 39:12.227
Stay down.

40:02.778 --> 40:05.822
It burns! It burns! It burns!

40:05.906 --> 40:08.492
-It burns! It burns! It burns!
-What? Where, Casp?

40:09.743 --> 40:12.704
Fuck you!

40:13.372 --> 40:14.498
Yes!

40:17.376 --> 40:18.836
You'll be okay.

40:48.949 --> 40:49.950
Shit!

40:51.118 --> 40:52.661
Get out! Get out!

40:52.744 --> 40:55.455
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

40:58.667 --> 40:59.668
It's safe!

41:00.419 --> 41:01.628
It's all right.

41:03.338 --> 41:06.425
-We got kids too!
-It's okay!

41:07.509 --> 41:08.594
We'll protect you!

41:15.976 --> 41:17.227
I hear 'em!

41:32.326 --> 41:33.368
It's you.

41:34.036 --> 41:35.787
-Okay.
-It's all right!

41:41.418 --> 41:43.045
Hey, you all right?

41:43.128 --> 41:45.589
-It's safe!
-It's okay!

41:47.049 --> 41:51.136
My family-- My family's alone.

41:51.929 --> 41:53.680
Where is she? Your wife.

41:53.764 --> 41:54.890
We got kids too.

41:54.973 --> 41:56.642
-Hiding.
-Take me to her.

41:57.226 --> 41:58.227
No.

42:00.479 --> 42:03.190
-I don't know where she's hiding, man.
-She knows me.

42:03.982 --> 42:05.484
-Doc Lockhart, right?
-Yeah.

42:05.567 --> 42:06.777
-Angela.
-Yeah, Angela.

42:06.860 --> 42:08.278
-Okay.
-Angela, yeah.

42:08.362 --> 42:11.114
You call her. Tell her it's all right.

42:13.075 --> 42:14.159
It's okay, I got you.

42:15.410 --> 42:16.954
-Okay. Yeah.
-You call her.

42:23.710 --> 42:24.962
Baby?

42:39.226 --> 42:40.435
Angela?

42:48.026 --> 42:49.611
Tell her it's safe.

42:49.695 --> 42:51.113
Angela, it's safe!

42:51.864 --> 42:53.282
Angela?

42:53.949 --> 42:56.368
Come on. Stay down.

42:56.952 --> 42:58.036
This way, guys!

43:00.706 --> 43:02.165
It's safe. I'm here!

43:06.628 --> 43:08.714
You can come out! It's all right.

43:12.843 --> 43:13.844
Over here!

43:23.562 --> 43:25.564
Keep looking. She's still hiding.

43:45.584 --> 43:46.627
Go, go, go.

43:55.010 --> 43:56.512
Look, I'm not gonna die.

43:58.597 --> 44:00.349
We're not all gonna die 'cause of you.

44:01.850 --> 44:03.060
Angela?

44:03.143 --> 44:04.394
You think I'm stupid, pal?

44:04.478 --> 44:07.356
I will put a bullet in your brain,
and hers and theirs,

44:07.439 --> 44:09.024
if you don't get her here now!

44:11.401 --> 44:12.861
Run, Aneesha!

44:14.029 --> 44:15.656
-Run, Aneesha!
-Go, go, go.

44:15.739 --> 44:17.324
Run!

44:21.453 --> 44:23.789
-Come.
-Dad! Stop! Mom!

44:23.872 --> 44:25.541
-Daddy!
-No! Stop!

44:26.583 --> 44:27.835
Let go of me!

44:35.592 --> 44:36.969
Stop, Mom!

44:41.473 --> 44:44.309
-Where are they? The other ones.
-The street.

44:57.865 --> 44:59.533
Move! Move, move, move!

45:09.418 --> 45:11.378
Back! Get down! Get down!

45:17.009 --> 45:18.510
Back up! Back! Back!

45:31.481 --> 45:32.482
Shit!

45:35.611 --> 45:36.612
Stay tight!

45:40.365 --> 45:41.992
-Stop!
-No. Dad!

45:42.075 --> 45:43.327
No. Mom, stop!

45:43.827 --> 45:44.828
Stop!

45:45.412 --> 45:46.455
Mommy!

45:47.956 --> 45:49.458
Mommy!

45:49.833 --> 45:51.168
-Mommy!
-Mom!

46:14.650 --> 46:15.651
Mom!

46:22.282 --> 46:24.284
Come on. Come.

47:28.849 --> 47:29.850
Hinata.

47:36.732 --> 47:38.734
What did you say

47:40.819 --> 47:42.821
the first time

47:46.200 --> 47:47.743
you came

47:49.953 --> 47:52.372
home with me?

48:08.639 --> 48:09.723
What is that?

48:10.390 --> 48:11.600
David Bowie.

49:11.034 --> 49:12.035
Hinata?

49:19.126 --> 49:20.377
Hinata.

49:21.503 --> 49:23.005
Hinata!

49:23.714 --> 49:25.340
Hinata!

49:39.396 --> 49:40.814
It wasn't us.

49:43.525 --> 49:45.652
She loved Bowie.

49:54.411 --> 49:56.371
-It's her.
-You do speak English.

49:56.455 --> 49:57.456
Fix it!

49:58.081 --> 50:00.334
Now they're playing our radio stations
back at us.

50:00.417 --> 50:01.543
I put you back in there,

50:01.627 --> 50:04.963
and we'll be listening to Johnny Cash
while they bomb us into the Stone Age.

50:05.047 --> 50:06.131
It's her.

50:07.591 --> 50:09.092
You think that changes anything?

50:12.638 --> 50:14.056
You will kill her.

50:15.849 --> 50:21.063
My president is willing to sacrifice
one life if it means saving billions.

50:22.272 --> 50:23.649
Are you?

50:28.946 --> 50:29.947
It's done.

50:32.991 --> 50:33.992
For what it's worth,

50:34.076 --> 50:36.745
I think you stalled them
long enough for us to fight back.

50:38.288 --> 50:40.165
You gave us a target to strike.

50:49.842 --> 50:50.843
Stay close.

51:30.257 --> 51:31.592
They're in my head.

51:36.555 --> 51:37.598
All of them.

51:41.518 --> 51:42.519
I'm in theirs.

51:50.903 --> 51:52.154
Caspar?

51:56.783 --> 51:57.993
Casp.

51:59.703 --> 52:00.704
Stop.

52:06.793 --> 52:07.753
Stop.

52:16.345 --> 52:17.346
Stop.

52:55.300 --> 52:56.301
You did that.

53:00.722 --> 53:01.723
Hey.

53:05.686 --> 53:06.728
Jedi shit.

53:08.188 --> 53:10.065
Hey, you did it.

53:12.818 --> 53:13.819
He did it.

53:19.074 --> 53:21.785
My mum. My mum.

53:21.869 --> 53:23.453
All right. Come on. Let's get you up.

53:25.747 --> 53:26.957
It's all right, kid.

53:35.716 --> 53:37.759
Come on. Let's go. Go. Come on.

53:55.819 --> 53:56.945
What?

53:57.779 --> 53:59.323
-I'm not--
-What?

54:00.032 --> 54:01.116
My mum.

54:10.167 --> 54:12.336
Hey. Hey, Caspar.

54:13.128 --> 54:14.838
-Hey. Hey, look at me, kid.
-Casp?

54:16.215 --> 54:18.050
-Hey, look at me. Look at me.
-What's wrong with him?

54:18.133 --> 54:19.551
No, no, no. Look at me.

54:19.635 --> 54:22.513
-Come on, kid. Caspar, wake up! Caspar!
-Is he holding them? Is that why?

54:22.596 --> 54:25.224
-What is it? Is he all right?
-Wake up. Look at me.
