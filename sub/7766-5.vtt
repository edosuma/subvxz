WEBVTT

00:12.999 --> 00:14.999
- Previously
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
Playtime's over.

00:16.999 --> 00:18.999
I'm back on the job at Sur,
and it's time to freshen up.

00:18.999 --> 00:19.999
Do you understand?

00:19.999 --> 00:21.000
- We're doing the best
that we can.

00:21.999 --> 00:22.999
- Well, the best
isn't good enough.

00:22.999 --> 00:23.999
- Schwartz did used to work
in wine and spirits.

00:23.999 --> 00:25.999
- Oh, yeah, that's what
my background is in.

00:25.999 --> 00:26.999
- Don't screw
any of us around.

00:26.999 --> 00:29.999
- Everyone looks at us
as the perfect, happy couple,

00:29.999 --> 00:31.999
but there are, like, issues.

00:31.999 --> 00:34.999
- Do you feel
like you're addicted to pills?

00:34.999 --> 00:35.999
- Mm-hmm.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.999
- Do not sweep them--
- I'm not going to.

00:37.999 --> 00:41.999
- Pull up that rug and clean out
the f***ing cobwebs.

00:41.999 --> 00:43.000
- Why did you get
so hammered?

00:43.999 --> 00:45.999
- I don't know, Kristen,
'cause the shots kept coming.

00:45.999 --> 00:47.999
- And now how do you feel
about that?

00:47.999 --> 00:49.999
- To be honest, I've got
a little bit of a hangover.

00:49.999 --> 00:51.999
- You're much sexier
as a DJ than a busser.

00:51.999 --> 00:53.999
- Lala's like that pretty,
hot girl that wants to be a slut

00:53.999 --> 00:57.999
but won't admit she's a slut,
but really she's a huge slut!

00:57.999 --> 00:59.999
When I say Lala's slutty,
what I'm really saying is,

00:59.999 --> 01:00.999
"Please come sit on my face."

01:00.999 --> 01:01.999
- Usually I meet a girl.

01:01.999 --> 01:03.999
Within ten minutes,
she's my girlfriend.

01:03.999 --> 01:04.999
- You and I would
definitely click, then.

- Oh, thanks, darling.

01:48.999 --> 01:49.999
- You're welcome.

01:49.999 --> 01:51.999
- Some of these are dirty
and need to be replaced.

01:51.999 --> 01:53.999
- Would you like me
to do that?

01:53.999 --> 01:54.999
- Yes.

01:54.999 --> 01:56.999
Okay, that one's fine.

01:56.999 --> 01:59.999
Everything okay
with you and Shay?

01:59.999 --> 02:02.999
- Just trying to live
a happy, healthy life.

02:02.999 --> 02:04.999
I feel like Shay's
at this point right now

02:04.999 --> 02:06.999
where he really needs to start
turning things around.

02:06.999 --> 02:09.999
So we're gonna go to the gym
five times a week.

02:09.999 --> 02:10.999
We're gonna eat better.

02:10.999 --> 02:13.999
And I don't want to lose
any weight, but maybe for him--

02:13.999 --> 02:14.999
It's like, and lose ten pounds.

02:14.999 --> 02:17.999
But the thing is,
I'm really good at cooking,

02:17.999 --> 02:19.999
but I'm really good
at cooking bad food,

02:19.999 --> 02:22.999
like pasta
and Mexican food.

02:22.999 --> 02:24.999
So Tom's gonna come over

02:24.999 --> 02:26.999
and teach how to make
healthy breakfasts.

02:26.999 --> 02:28.999
- Who? Tom Sandoval?
- Yeah.

02:28.999 --> 02:31.999
- Well, you have fun with that.
- Oh, well, thank you.

02:31.999 --> 02:34.999
I'm sure I'm going to enjoy
an egg-white whatever.

02:34.999 --> 02:36.999
- It's very nice
that Tom's gonna go over there

02:36.999 --> 02:38.999
and cook a healthy breakfast,

02:38.999 --> 02:42.999
but addiction is not cured
by some scrambled egg whites.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.999
So off you go, then.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.999
Do not let me--

02:47.999 --> 02:48.999
Jax?
- Yeah?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.999
Where are you going with that?
What is that?

02:51.999 --> 02:53.999
- It's a case of wine.

02:53.999 --> 02:54.999
- Where are you taking it?

02:54.999 --> 02:56.999
- To the bar.
I'm stocking it.

02:56.999 --> 02:58.999
- Jax has stolen a lot
of things. Let's be honest.

02:58.999 --> 02:59.999
He's stolen candles from me.

02:59.999 --> 03:01.999
I know there's vodka
in his apartment.

03:01.999 --> 03:04.999
And he's basically stolen
his best friend's girlfriend.

03:04.999 --> 03:06.999
That goes in that bar
over there.

03:06.999 --> 03:07.999
- What was going on
with Scheana?

03:07.999 --> 03:09.999
- Nothing. Why?
- Is everything all right?

03:09.999 --> 03:13.999
- Clearly we have seen
that there are problems.

03:13.999 --> 03:14.999
- It's not coming
from the alcohol or pills.

03:14.999 --> 03:16.999
He's obviously running away
from something else,

03:16.999 --> 03:17.999
because he has no voice.

03:17.999 --> 03:19.999
- Listen, you're not
a therapist.

03:19.999 --> 03:21.999
- I give pretty good advice.
I just don't take it.

03:21.999 --> 03:22.999
- You give advice?
- I give great advice.

03:22.999 --> 03:24.999
- You can't get
your own sh** together,

03:24.999 --> 03:25.999
let alone somebody else's.

03:25.999 --> 03:26.999
Where's Brittany?

03:26.999 --> 03:28.999
- I would like
to be exclusive.

03:28.999 --> 03:30.999
- You're not gonna meet
another girl, you promise?

03:30.999 --> 03:31.999
- I promise.
I love this.

03:31.999 --> 03:33.999
She's back in Kentucky.

03:33.999 --> 03:35.999
- But I thought this was it.
This was the one.

03:35.999 --> 03:37.999
- Well, if she moves
out here...

03:37.999 --> 03:38.999
I don't do
long-distance relationships.

03:38.999 --> 03:39.999
If you live in the Valley,

03:39.999 --> 03:41.999
that's a long-distance
relationship to me.

03:41.999 --> 03:43.999
- Why are you being so negative
about Scheana and Shay?

03:43.999 --> 03:44.999
You should be supportive.

03:44.999 --> 03:47.999
- I have milk that has a longer
shelf life than that marriage.

03:47.999 --> 03:48.999
- That is so mean.

03:48.999 --> 03:51.999
- I just feel like Shay's trying
to live up to this person

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
that Scheana wants him
to be so much

03:53.999 --> 03:55.000
that he's just
driving himself crazy.

03:55.999 --> 03:58.999
- It's almost like
it's his mother, not his wife.

03:58.999 --> 04:00.999
She needs to let him have
some say in things.

04:00.999 --> 04:01.999
He has no balls.

04:01.999 --> 04:03.999
- Well, would you have balls...
- Absolutely.

04:03.999 --> 04:05.999
- If you were chomping
on f***ing pills all day?

04:05.999 --> 04:07.999
- Well, why do you think
he's doing that?

04:07.999 --> 04:08.999
Because he's miserable.
- No, he's not.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.999
- He is miserable.
- Are you kidding me?

04:10.999 --> 04:12.999
Scheana's the best thing
that ever happened to him.

04:12.999 --> 04:13.999
He's been doing this
a lot longer

04:13.999 --> 04:15.999
than since he's been
with her.

04:15.999 --> 04:18.999
- I'm the only one that has any
eyes on this whole situation.

04:18.999 --> 04:19.999
She needs to hear
the truth.

04:19.999 --> 04:22.999
- Keep your nose out of it--
your new nose out of it.

04:29.999 --> 04:31.999
- Ow.

04:31.999 --> 04:32.999
I got lemon juice
in my eye.

04:32.999 --> 04:34.999
- I feel like sh** today.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.999
- You drank too much?

04:36.999 --> 04:37.999
- I don't think it's that
I drank too much.

04:37.999 --> 04:39.999
I think the mixture
of everything.

04:39.999 --> 04:40.999
How do you feel?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.999
- I was mixing everything--
whiskey, you name it, vodka.

04:43.999 --> 04:45.999
- Remember when--
- Oh, sh**.

04:45.999 --> 04:47.999
- You just dropped your drink
and it shattered everywhere.

04:47.999 --> 04:49.999
Do you remember that?
- I dropped my drink?

04:49.999 --> 04:51.999
- I can't hang out with you.
You're a bad influence.

04:51.999 --> 04:52.999
- Sometimes.

04:52.999 --> 04:54.999
- Yeah.

04:54.999 --> 04:55.999
- It was a good
make-out sesh, though.

04:55.999 --> 04:57.999
- It was.

04:57.999 --> 04:59.000
- I've been feeling
this flirty sexual tension

04:59.000 --> 05:00.999
between me and Lala
from the day I saw her.

05:00.999 --> 05:02.999
So I don't feel bad at all.

05:02.999 --> 05:04.999
I feel really good
about making out with her.

05:04.999 --> 05:05.999
I mean, she's hot.

05:05.999 --> 05:07.999
- So let's talk
about this, then.

05:07.999 --> 05:08.999
- What?

05:08.999 --> 05:12.999
- 'Cause you just broke up
with Kristen, like, yesterday.

05:12.999 --> 05:14.999
Yeah.

05:14.999 --> 05:16.999
I'm completely broken up
with Kristen.

05:16.999 --> 05:18.999
We just haven't broken up yet.

05:18.999 --> 05:20.999
- Well, I know that she can get
a little bit crazy and scrappy,

05:20.999 --> 05:24.000
and I can get scrappy too,
but I prefer not to.

05:24.999 --> 05:25.999
I've never met Kristen,

05:25.999 --> 05:27.999
but I've heard about Kristen...
a lot.

05:27.999 --> 05:29.000
- She's gonna come
looking for me. What?

05:29.000 --> 05:32.999
- Last night James told me
that they're broken up.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.999
There's no two-week,
two-month rule after a breakup.

05:35.999 --> 05:37.999
You could break up five minutes
before our date.

05:37.999 --> 05:39.999
He's officially single.

05:39.999 --> 05:40.999
So let's get it popping.

05:40.999 --> 05:42.999
- But enough
about Kristen, yeah.

05:42.999 --> 05:43.999
I had fun last night,
you know?

05:43.999 --> 05:45.999
Do you want to go have dinner
tomorrow night?

05:45.999 --> 05:47.999
- Yes.
- You free?

05:47.999 --> 05:49.999
- Yeah.
- All right, cool.

05:54.999 --> 05:56.999
- Got some reservations
on the book.

05:56.999 --> 05:58.999
- Everything good over here,
you two?

05:58.999 --> 06:00.999
Lights better?

06:11.999 --> 06:12.999
- Hey. Hi.

06:12.999 --> 06:13.999
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.999
- You know James, right?
- Yeah.

06:15.999 --> 06:16.999
- Will you do me a favor

06:16.999 --> 06:18.999
and just let him know
that Kristen's here?

06:18.999 --> 06:19.999
- Yeah.
- That I'm gonna be out back...

06:20.000 --> 06:21.999
if he can come outside
for a sec?

06:21.999 --> 06:22.999
- Yeah.
- Okay, awesome.

06:22.999 --> 06:24.000
Thank you so much.
- Of course.

06:33.999 --> 06:35.999
- What's up, beautiful?
- Kristen is outside right now.

06:35.999 --> 06:37.000
- Shut up.

06:37.999 --> 06:38.999
- No, my heart is pounding
right now.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.999
This is the part
of the horror movie

06:40.999 --> 06:42.999
where the girl
with lashes and high heels

06:42.999 --> 06:44.999
is trying to get away,

06:44.999 --> 06:47.999
and then the crazy person
slashes her throat.

06:47.999 --> 06:49.000
- Are you kidding me?
- I swear to God.

06:49.999 --> 06:50.999
- Are you f***ing kidding me?

06:50.999 --> 06:53.999
- She's, like, literally waiting
for you out back.

06:58.999 --> 06:59.999
- Peter.
- Hey.

06:59.999 --> 07:01.999
- Hey, man. Sorry. I know
I'm DJ'ing the lounge right now,

07:01.999 --> 07:04.999
and I just got go sort something
out in the back really quickly.

07:04.999 --> 07:05.999
Is that okay?

07:05.999 --> 07:07.999
I mean, you can--
- I know. Go.

07:07.999 --> 07:10.999
Sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

07:10.999 --> 07:12.999
- Just don't leave me hanging
with the music.

07:12.999 --> 07:15.999
- I won't. I won't.

07:17.999 --> 07:20.999
Hello.
- Hey.

07:22.999 --> 07:24.999
- Did you ask
if you could step outside?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.999
- Yeah, I'm all right.

07:27.999 --> 07:29.999
- Okay, cool.

07:29.999 --> 07:31.999
So...

07:31.999 --> 07:34.999
- So I don't trust you.
I think you f***ed somebody.

07:34.999 --> 07:35.999
- Okay, well, I didn't.

07:35.999 --> 07:37.999
- Kristen went to Detroit
a couple days ago

07:37.999 --> 07:39.999
to do this f***ing
modeling shoot.

07:39.999 --> 07:41.999
- I went to Detroit
on a modeling shoot.

07:41.999 --> 07:42.999
- She ends up going out drinking
two nights in a row

07:42.999 --> 07:44.999
till 5:00 in the morning.

07:44.999 --> 07:45.999
- I went out with some friends,

07:45.999 --> 07:48.000
and my phone died
for, like, a span of time.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.999
- Does not f***ing call me,
does not text me,

07:49.999 --> 07:51.999
does not pick up her phone.

07:51.999 --> 07:53.999
- I suddenly get all these
psycho-ass text messages.

07:53.999 --> 07:55.999
- For all I know,

07:55.999 --> 07:57.000
she's just f***ing this guy
nonstop after the shoot.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.999
- Typical James
"Jekyll and Hyde" situation.

07:59.999 --> 08:00.999
- No, 'cause, Kristen,
you know what?

08:00.999 --> 08:02.999
I'm actually not gonna raise
my voice.

08:02.999 --> 08:03.999
- No, you're not gonna raise
your voice.

08:03.999 --> 08:04.999
- I'm not gonna call
you names either,

08:04.999 --> 08:07.999
even though I probably should.

08:07.999 --> 08:10.999
- I don't want to be with you.
- I don't want to be with you.

08:10.999 --> 08:13.999
- Then we're good.
- Good.

08:13.999 --> 08:16.000
- You disrespect me.
- You f***ed someone else.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.999
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

08:17.999 --> 08:19.999
How is it that you go out
all the time

08:19.999 --> 08:21.999
and your phone
mysteriously turns off?

08:21.999 --> 08:23.000
- James, every time
I'm out of town--

08:23.999 --> 08:25.999
- Every f***ing time!
- Don't raise your voice to me.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.999
- Every f***ing time
you go somewhere, Kristen.

08:28.999 --> 08:29.999
- Don't.

08:29.999 --> 08:31.999
- Over the span
of a year and a half,

08:31.999 --> 08:33.999
yeah, my phone's been dead
a couple of times.

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
It's been turned off.

08:35.999 --> 08:38.999
If I wanted to cheat on James,
I could leave my phone on.

08:38.999 --> 08:39.999
- You're a liar.

08:39.999 --> 08:41.999
You were getting it in
that night,

08:41.999 --> 08:42.999
and you were f***ing

08:42.999 --> 08:45.999
that f***ing
ugly-ass motherf***er, okay?

08:45.999 --> 08:46.999
See this?

08:46.999 --> 08:48.999
You're never gonna have it,
ever again.

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
You might find yourself a nice,
good-looking 35-year-old,

08:50.999 --> 08:53.999
maybe another Jax 2.0,
but, honey, you ain't gonna have

08:53.999 --> 08:56.999
this young,
good-looking thing ever again.

08:56.999 --> 08:57.999
If you want to see
what I'm doing,

08:57.999 --> 08:59.999
that's gonna be
you stalking me.

08:59.999 --> 09:02.999
like you have done to all
your ex-other boyfriends, right?

09:02.999 --> 09:03.999
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:03.999 --> 09:04.999
- How's it going?

09:04.999 --> 09:06.999
- I'm a little, like,
kind of flustered.

09:06.999 --> 09:07.999
- Why?

09:07.999 --> 09:09.999
- I've never met
this Kristen before,

09:09.999 --> 09:13.999
and she literally just came up
to me and was like,

09:13.999 --> 09:15.999
"I need to talk to James.
Where's James?"

09:15.999 --> 09:18.999
- So she's here?
- She's f***ing here.

09:18.999 --> 09:19.999
She's out back.

09:19.999 --> 09:21.999
- Why is this
your problem?

09:21.999 --> 09:23.999
- Because James and I had
a few drinks last night.

09:23.999 --> 09:27.999
Like, all we did was, you know,
like, make out,

09:27.999 --> 09:30.999
like we're
in f***ing junior high.

09:30.999 --> 09:31.999
- What?

09:31.999 --> 09:32.999
- There's a difference

09:32.999 --> 09:36.999
between girls that get crazy
and crazy girls.

09:36.999 --> 09:39.999
- You know what?
There's crazies right here.

09:39.999 --> 09:41.999
She's right there.
- Really?

09:41.999 --> 09:43.999
- The definition of crazy
is Kristen Doute.

09:43.999 --> 09:44.999
She never says, "I'm crazy."

09:44.999 --> 09:47.999
The crazy ones are always
thinking that everything's okay.

09:47.999 --> 09:51.999
We're grown-ass men,
and I'm afraid of her, okay?

09:51.999 --> 09:52.999
I am.
- She gives me anxiety.

09:52.999 --> 09:55.999
I mean, she's my ex.
- She 100% knows where you live.

09:55.999 --> 09:56.999
- Yeah.
- She knows who your family is.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.999
She knows where your kids are.
- Shh.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.999
Yeah.
- Damn.

10:00.999 --> 10:01.999
- Coming up...

10:01.999 --> 10:03.999
- You're f***ing up
your life.

10:03.999 --> 10:05.999
- You're f***ing sick
in the head, Kristen.

10:05.999 --> 10:06.999
- You're gonna try
to get it in with Lala?

10:06.999 --> 10:09.999
- I don't want to date Lala.
I just want to sleep with her.

10:17.999 --> 10:18.999
I was so good to you.

10:18.999 --> 10:20.999
- What, you brought me
lunch all the time,

10:20.999 --> 10:22.999
bought me some nice clothes?

10:22.999 --> 10:24.999
Is that what
you're talking about?

10:24.999 --> 10:26.999
You have played me for too long,
and I'm done.

10:26.999 --> 10:28.999
Sorry, babe.
Done.

10:28.999 --> 10:31.999
And you know how upset I am?
Guess how upset I am.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.000
I'm not upset at all,
and I won't miss you.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.999
- Okay.

10:35.999 --> 10:36.999
- You know,
I guess you could say

10:36.999 --> 10:38.000
me and Kristen were doomed
from the start, you know.

10:38.999 --> 10:39.999
She was never really ready

10:39.999 --> 10:42.999
to get into an emotional,
love relationship,

10:42.999 --> 10:46.999
and I was never really able
to let her nasty past go.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.999
You're f***ing sick
in the head, Kristen.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
You've got problems, and you
are not gonna find a guy,

10:51.999 --> 10:53.999
because you don't know
what f***ing love is, okay?

10:53.999 --> 10:54.999
- No, I actually will.

10:57.999 --> 10:58.999
You are jokes.
- I'm sorry.

10:58.999 --> 11:02.999
- Darling, you are jokes.
- I actually am sorry.

11:02.999 --> 11:05.999
I think that my past

11:05.999 --> 11:08.999
has affected you so much,

11:08.999 --> 11:10.999
and I feel like sh**
about that.

11:10.999 --> 11:13.999
You're so rude to me.
You try to hurt me.

11:13.999 --> 11:14.999
- Yeah, you're right.

11:14.999 --> 11:16.999
- And I've worked
so f***ing hard on myself.

11:16.999 --> 11:18.999
- No, you haven't.

11:18.999 --> 11:20.999
You're the same f***ing person
you were a year ago, honey.

11:20.999 --> 11:23.999
- My one thing since day one
of James and I dating

11:23.999 --> 11:25.999
is that
I would always be honest

11:25.999 --> 11:28.999
about my past,
about my reputation,

11:28.999 --> 11:32.999
and all James is doing is
throwing that sh** in my face.

11:32.999 --> 11:34.999
I care about you.

11:34.999 --> 11:37.999
I think you are gorgeous
and talented,

11:37.999 --> 11:39.999
and I think that you're throwing
it all away,

11:39.999 --> 11:40.999
and it breaks
my f***ing heart.

11:40.999 --> 11:42.999
- Throwing what away--
this relationship?

11:42.999 --> 11:44.999
- Your life, James.
- I'm throwing away my life?

11:44.999 --> 11:48.999
- You've been on this path
of self-destructiveness.

11:48.999 --> 11:49.999
You are f***ing up
your life.

11:49.999 --> 11:50.999
- No, I'm not!

11:50.999 --> 11:52.999
I am the f***ing
hardest worker here.

11:52.999 --> 11:54.999
I went from busboy
washing dishes

11:54.999 --> 11:56.999
to now fully DJ'ing.

11:56.999 --> 11:59.999
The only person f***ing up
my life is Kristen.

11:59.999 --> 12:02.999
She's the one walking into Pump
when I'm DJ'ing drunk.

12:02.999 --> 12:04.999
She's the one that shows up
randomly behind Sur

12:04.999 --> 12:06.999
to talk to me
while I'm trying to work.

12:06.999 --> 12:08.999
Clearly she's the one
f***ing my sh** up.

12:08.999 --> 12:10.999
Let's be real.
Who's f***ing up their life.

12:10.999 --> 12:12.999
- I'm done.
Like, stop.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.999
- Kristen, I'm upset
because you keep saying

12:14.999 --> 12:15.999
I'm f***ing up my life.

12:15.999 --> 12:16.999
My life is so put together,

12:16.999 --> 12:19.999
and, quite frankly, I'm happier
that I'm now not with you.

12:19.999 --> 12:21.999
Kristen Doute, it's over, okay?
- Fine.

12:21.999 --> 12:24.999
- Have a good life.
- Okay.

12:25.999 --> 12:27.999
- I've got a date tomorrow.

12:27.999 --> 12:29.999
It's gonna be a lot funner
than I've had at any time

12:29.999 --> 12:31.999
with you, darling,
all right?

12:31.999 --> 12:35.999
Have a nice life,
Kristen Doute.

12:35.999 --> 12:39.999
- I love him so much.
He was my best friend.

12:39.999 --> 12:41.999
I gave him f***ing everything,

12:41.999 --> 12:44.999
but I don't think he really
appreciates me at all.

12:52.999 --> 12:54.999
All right, let's go.

13:17.999 --> 13:19.999
- That's a lot of coffee.

13:19.999 --> 13:21.999
- We have a long day.

13:21.999 --> 13:22.999
- Oh, yeah.

13:22.999 --> 13:25.999
- I had asked Tom
if he would come over

13:25.999 --> 13:27.999
and make us dinner one night,

13:27.999 --> 13:29.999
because I want to get better
with, like, cooking,

13:29.999 --> 13:31.999
like, salmon and steaks
and stuff for dinner.

13:31.999 --> 13:34.999
Somehow--He had a better idea
to come over

13:34.999 --> 13:36.999
and make us omelets
in the morning.

13:36.999 --> 13:39.999
But I like cooking, and I want
to learn how to cook better,

13:39.999 --> 13:41.000
healthier foods,

13:41.999 --> 13:43.999
'cause, I mean, at this age,

13:43.999 --> 13:46.999
we should not be
this out of shape.

13:47.999 --> 13:50.999
- It's open!
It's always open.

13:50.999 --> 13:53.999
I didn't know
you were coming too, my love.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.999
- Hey.
- Nice morning surprise.

13:55.999 --> 13:57.000
- Yeah.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.999
- I didn't think
you would wake up early.

13:58.999 --> 14:00.999
- What's up, brother?
How's it going, man?

14:00.999 --> 14:01.999
- Good.

14:01.999 --> 14:05.999
Shay's my buddy, man.
I was in his wedding.

14:05.999 --> 14:07.999
You look so good.

14:07.999 --> 14:09.999
I know he's going through
some things right now,

14:09.999 --> 14:11.999
and I just want to be able
to help him.

14:11.999 --> 14:13.999
- I brought a lot
of really good stuff here.

14:13.999 --> 14:15.999
I want to be his,
like, Rocky's trainer.

14:15.999 --> 14:18.999
I want to see him victorious

14:18.999 --> 14:20.999
on a mountaintop.

14:20.999 --> 14:23.999
I want to show you guys
some tips and tricks.

14:23.999 --> 14:24.999
You know, start off
with breakfast,

14:24.999 --> 14:27.999
and maybe we can work
on some other stuff too.

14:27.999 --> 14:31.999
- Tom is secretly a little bit
of a homemaker.

14:31.999 --> 14:33.999
As long as I've been with him,

14:33.999 --> 14:36.999
he's just been cooking up
a storm.

14:36.999 --> 14:38.999
- We went to bed last night,

14:38.999 --> 14:40.999
and I kind of, like,
fell asleep.

14:40.999 --> 14:42.999
Then I woke back up,
and I ate three Otter Pops.

14:42.999 --> 14:45.999
- Sugar is
the f***ing devil.

14:45.999 --> 14:46.999
- Yeah.

14:46.999 --> 14:48.999
- It's just so good.

14:48.999 --> 14:50.999
- You guys want
to come, uh...?

14:50.999 --> 14:52.999
- Yeah.

14:52.999 --> 14:55.999
- I used to do this
for a living.

14:55.999 --> 14:57.999
- Make omelets?

14:57.999 --> 14:58.999
- No, it was basically
like an on-site,

14:58.999 --> 15:00.999
like, catering service.

15:00.999 --> 15:02.999
- Shut--
- I'm serious.

15:02.999 --> 15:04.999
I was an omelet-and-
scramble-making machine

15:04.999 --> 15:05.999
back in the day.

15:05.999 --> 15:07.999
- Should I go for it?
- Do it.

15:07.999 --> 15:09.999
- There was a time there
in the mid 2000s

15:09.999 --> 15:12.999
where if you were a highly paid,
super-hot actress,

15:12.999 --> 15:14.999
you probably ate my eggs.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.999
Oh, make it.

15:18.999 --> 15:21.999
- All right, so what I've
prepared for you

15:21.999 --> 15:24.999
is a mostly egg white omelet

15:24.999 --> 15:27.999
with organic mushrooms,
spinach,

15:27.999 --> 15:28.999
organic broccoli,

15:28.999 --> 15:33.999
and then this is a fresh celery,
kale, broccoli, lemon,

15:33.999 --> 15:36.999
ginger, and apple.

15:36.999 --> 15:37.999
All juiced.

15:37.999 --> 15:38.999
- I don't like
anything green, yo.

15:38.999 --> 15:39.999
- Cheers.

15:45.999 --> 15:47.999
- So what do you guys think?

15:47.999 --> 15:50.999
- You got more cheese
than I did.

15:56.999 --> 15:57.999
- Hey.
- Dude.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.999
I feel like something...

15:59.999 --> 16:01.999
you know,
I hate to make you do this.

16:01.999 --> 16:03.999
Maybe, like, something muddled.

16:03.999 --> 16:04.999
Like a mojito.

16:04.999 --> 16:06.999
- I figured as much.
- Maybe a raspberry mojito?

16:06.999 --> 16:07.999
- What's going on, dude?
- Just chillin'.

16:07.999 --> 16:08.999
I got the day off.

16:08.999 --> 16:10.999
- Day off?
You don't have a job.

16:10.999 --> 16:11.999
- I know.

16:11.999 --> 16:13.999
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh is right.

16:13.999 --> 16:14.999
- Whoa.
- What are you doing, Schwartzy,

16:15.000 --> 16:15.999
in the day?
- Would you like to--

16:16.000 --> 16:17.999
- Aren't you supposed to be,
like,

16:17.999 --> 16:19.999
practicing your, like,
sangria pitch?

16:19.999 --> 16:20.999
- I'm--watch this.
Mm.

16:20.999 --> 16:21.999
- Disgusting.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
- I'll have a sangria.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.999
- Got it.

16:25.999 --> 16:26.999
- I am informing everybody

16:26.999 --> 16:28.999
we got a sommelier
coming tomorrow.

16:28.999 --> 16:30.999
- I promised Peter--
you know Peter--

16:30.999 --> 16:32.999
I promised him that I'd go
with him to get his haircut.

16:32.999 --> 16:33.999
It's a big deal.
He's cutting his long hair.

16:33.999 --> 16:34.999
- What--are you kidding me?

16:34.999 --> 16:36.999
That's more important than this?

16:36.999 --> 16:37.999
- He's cutting his ponytail off.

16:37.999 --> 16:39.999
- Why now is
he chopping that thing off?

16:39.999 --> 16:40.999
- I don't know.

16:40.999 --> 16:41.999
I think 'cause of
his new girlfriend.

16:41.999 --> 16:45.000
- Peter and I have something
to tell you guys.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.999
- Oh, my God,
you guys are getting married.

16:46.999 --> 16:47.999
- Not yet.
Not yet.

16:47.999 --> 16:49.999
But I'm open to it.

16:49.999 --> 16:50.999
- By the way, I just--
real quick--

16:50.999 --> 16:54.999
don't we have a new
fratinization rule in place?

16:54.999 --> 16:55.999
- What are you talking about?

16:55.999 --> 16:57.999
- You know,
employee fratinization...

16:57.999 --> 17:00.999
- I don't think Jax is
actually understanding

17:00.999 --> 17:02.999
what the word
fra-ter-ni-zation is.

17:02.999 --> 17:04.999
Not fratinization.

17:04.999 --> 17:06.999
Oh, you are implementing
fraternization rules?

17:06.999 --> 17:07.999
- Well, I feel like
there's one in place already.

17:07.999 --> 17:08.999
- Oh, that is rich.

17:08.999 --> 17:10.999
- Ethics, ethics.
- Well, it seems like

17:10.999 --> 17:11.999
somebody's a little kind
of bitter.

17:11.999 --> 17:13.999
- I'm not bitter.
- Oh--oh, I see.

17:13.999 --> 17:14.999
- I'm not bitter.
- This--this coming from

17:14.999 --> 17:15.999
the number one perpetrator
of every...

17:15.999 --> 17:17.000
- Since when--yeah.
Yeah, exactly.

17:17.999 --> 17:18.999
- Listen--
- Are you trying to sabotage

17:19.000 --> 17:20.999
Lala and James?

17:20.999 --> 17:21.999
- I--he's gonna
sink his own ship.

17:21.999 --> 17:22.999
I don't have to do anything.

17:22.999 --> 17:24.999
- This is actually
one of those rare times

17:24.999 --> 17:25.999
where Jax isn't
causing the sh**.

17:25.999 --> 17:27.999
He's only stirring it
from the sidelines.

17:27.999 --> 17:28.999
- You've been eyeing up Lala,

17:28.999 --> 17:31.999
and suddenly the little
100-pound pip-squeak

17:31.999 --> 17:32.999
has come in
and stolen your thunder.

17:32.999 --> 17:34.999
- He's definitely getting
in my way a little bit.

17:34.999 --> 17:35.999
I'm not gonna lie.

17:35.999 --> 17:37.999
- Jax used to be the cock of the
walk around here,

17:37.999 --> 17:40.999
and now it's James
who's getting all the attention.

17:40.999 --> 17:42.999
Ooh, I see.

17:42.999 --> 17:45.999
Somebody's feathers are
a little bit ruffled.

17:45.999 --> 17:46.999
All right, go through
what you're supposed to do.

17:46.999 --> 17:47.999
- All right.
I'll talk to you later.

17:47.999 --> 17:48.999
- All right,
I'll get on the sangria stuff.

17:48.999 --> 17:50.999
Yeah.

17:50.999 --> 17:51.999
- I will.

17:51.999 --> 17:52.999
I mean, I know
you love Brittany,

17:52.999 --> 17:54.999
but are you still gonna
try to get it in with Lala?

17:54.999 --> 17:55.999
- I don't wanna date Lala.

17:55.999 --> 17:56.999
I just want to sleep with her.

17:59.999 --> 18:00.999
- I really don't think

18:00.999 --> 18:02.999
he's gonna f*** up again.

18:02.999 --> 18:03.999
I think he's gonna do
everything in his power

18:03.999 --> 18:07.999
to make me
the happiest woman alive.

18:18.999 --> 18:21.999
♪ Right now ♪

18:21.999 --> 18:22.999
♪ I will stay by your side ♪

18:22.999 --> 18:25.999
- This is a good look.

18:25.999 --> 18:27.999
- Open your eyes, Kristen.

18:27.999 --> 18:28.999
- I'm so puffy.

18:28.999 --> 18:30.999
- You're not puffy.

18:30.999 --> 18:32.999
I love that
you brought me to a dive bar

18:32.999 --> 18:34.999
in the middle of the day.

18:34.999 --> 18:37.999
There's a guy drinking whiskey
over at the bar.

18:37.999 --> 18:38.999
It's, like, noon.

18:38.999 --> 18:39.999
- Yeah.
- We're with our people.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.999
- Rachel is my girl power
friend.

18:41.999 --> 18:44.999
So when there's sh** going down
in my life,

18:44.999 --> 18:46.999
she's the girl I want to
sit down and have a drink with.

18:46.999 --> 18:47.999
I need to eat something
hella legit.

18:47.999 --> 18:50.999
I haven't eaten since
we had lunch yesterday.

18:50.999 --> 18:51.999
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

18:51.999 --> 18:53.999
- Hi, how you guys doing?
- Hi.

18:53.999 --> 18:54.999
- Good, how are you?
- Good.

18:54.999 --> 18:55.999
And here's the drink menu.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.999
- We'll do a bottle of
sauvignon blanc, please.

18:58.999 --> 18:59.999
- Sure.
- Thank you.

18:59.999 --> 19:01.999
- What time is it?

19:01.999 --> 19:03.999
A bottle?
- It's five o'clock somewhere.

19:03.999 --> 19:05.999
- Yeah.
- Um...

19:05.999 --> 19:07.999
James is an ego,
and he's rude,

19:07.999 --> 19:08.999
and he's not the person

19:09.000 --> 19:11.999
that I started
dating a year-and-a-half ago.

19:11.999 --> 19:12.999
Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

19:12.999 --> 19:13.999
- You're welcome.

19:13.999 --> 19:17.000
- Um...I feel like
he wants to be Jax.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.999
Like, Jax can be friends
with everyone,

19:18.999 --> 19:20.999
he's like a womanizer,

19:20.999 --> 19:21.999
he doesn't care about anything,

19:21.999 --> 19:23.999
he can get drunk
and people still like him.

19:23.999 --> 19:26.999
But James is going about it
in this way that, like,

19:26.999 --> 19:27.999
you just look like a douche.

19:27.999 --> 19:29.999
When I first started
dating James,

19:29.999 --> 19:31.999
his confidence was
so attractive,

19:31.999 --> 19:33.999
and now his ego has just been
growing and growing.

19:33.999 --> 19:35.999
It's, like, non-stop.

19:35.999 --> 19:37.999
He's like a f***ing Chia Pet.

19:37.999 --> 19:39.999
Like, I can't, like,
calm the f*** down.

19:39.999 --> 19:40.999
James has been telling me
about this girl

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
for the last few weeks
that works at Sur...

19:43.999 --> 19:44.999
- Who?
- This new chick named Lala.

19:44.999 --> 19:46.999
- Lala?
- So James said, "Yeah,

19:46.999 --> 19:47.999
there's this new chick there."
He's like,

19:47.999 --> 19:49.999
"She's a total whore."

19:49.999 --> 19:50.999
She says sh** to him like,

19:50.999 --> 19:52.999
"Oh, I dressed extra slutty
today."

19:52.999 --> 19:53.999
And last night,
when he's like,

19:53.999 --> 19:56.999
"Oh, sweetie, I already have
a date tomorrow."

19:56.999 --> 19:57.999
Totally thought
he was just saying that

19:57.999 --> 19:58.999
to piss me off.

19:58.999 --> 19:59.999
- He said that?
- Mm-hmm.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.999
Which means he asked
said girl on date

20:01.999 --> 20:02.999
before we broke up.

20:02.999 --> 20:04.999
And then after I, like,
walked away,

20:04.999 --> 20:07.999
he went inside,
and then I saw Jax outside.

20:07.999 --> 20:08.999
So I say this to Jax,
I was like...

20:08.999 --> 20:09.999
- What a slumbag.
- "Oh," I was like,

20:09.999 --> 20:11.999
"I bet he's gonna f*** Lala.

20:11.999 --> 20:12.999
Like, I'm not stupid."
- What a scumbag.

20:12.999 --> 20:14.999
- And Jax goes,
"Oh, no, they just made out."

20:14.999 --> 20:16.999
And I was like,
"Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:16.999 --> 20:17.999
What the f*** did you just say?"

20:17.999 --> 20:19.999
Like...sad to f***ing livid.

20:19.999 --> 20:21.999
- I walked outside
to catch a breather,

20:21.999 --> 20:23.999
and Kristen is out there,
crying.

20:23.999 --> 20:25.999
So I'm like, "All he did was
make out with her.

20:25.999 --> 20:26.999
It's not that big of a deal,
right?"

20:26.999 --> 20:28.999
- Are you f***ing
kidding me, Jax?

20:28.999 --> 20:30.999
- She goes like this.

20:30.999 --> 20:32.999
"No, I didn't know that."

20:32.999 --> 20:33.999
I thought she knew!

20:33.999 --> 20:34.999
I was trying to
make her start feeling better.

20:34.999 --> 20:35.999
I go, "All he did was kiss her."

20:35.999 --> 20:37.999
Diarrhea mouth, I'm sorry.

20:37.999 --> 20:39.000
- She was like, you know,
crying,

20:39.999 --> 20:40.999
and I was by myself,
so what do I do?

20:40.999 --> 20:41.999
- You go like this.
You go...

20:41.999 --> 20:43.999
Whoa.

20:43.999 --> 20:44.999
- So that happened,

20:44.999 --> 20:46.999
and yeah,
I was super sad last night.

20:46.999 --> 20:48.999
I woke up super sad.
Barely slept.

20:48.999 --> 20:50.999
Threw up all day.
Went to therapy.

20:50.999 --> 20:52.999
Started feeling
a little bit better.

20:52.999 --> 20:53.999
And then just started
thinking about it,

20:53.999 --> 20:56.999
and I'm like,
what is it that I'm missing?

20:56.999 --> 21:00.999
Because what I'm missing
doesn't exist anymore.

21:10.999 --> 21:11.999
- Heywood!
- Hey, Peter.

21:11.999 --> 21:12.999
- Hey!
- How are you?

21:12.999 --> 21:13.999
- I'm good.
How you been?

21:13.999 --> 21:15.999
- I'm good.
Glad you made it.

21:15.999 --> 21:17.999
- Awesome.
This is--these are my friends.

21:17.999 --> 21:18.999
Tom.
- Hey, Tom, nice to meet you.

21:18.999 --> 21:19.999
- I'm Tom.
- Jax.

21:19.999 --> 21:21.999
- How you doing?
- Hey, Jax.

21:21.999 --> 21:22.999
- I'm Jax, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, man.

21:22.999 --> 21:23.999
- Nice to meet you.
- I dig the hair, man.

21:23.999 --> 21:24.999
- Thank you.
- I like it.

21:24.999 --> 21:27.999
- As of 2010, I've had this.

21:27.999 --> 21:29.999
So let's get to work, Heywood.

21:29.999 --> 21:31.999
- Let's get--
- Let's get to work, baby.

21:31.999 --> 21:32.999
This ponytail.

21:32.999 --> 21:33.999
It's been awesome.

21:33.999 --> 21:36.999
It's served me pretty well.

21:36.999 --> 21:39.999
- And take about three to four
inch above?

21:39.999 --> 21:41.000
- How much is that?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.999
Maybe a little bit
more than that.

21:42.999 --> 21:43.999
- Really?
- Whoa!

21:43.999 --> 21:45.999
- Whoa!
- There you go!

21:45.999 --> 21:46.999
- I wanna get rid of it.

21:46.999 --> 21:48.999
- Are you donating your hair?

21:48.999 --> 21:49.999
- Are you gonna donate it?

21:49.999 --> 21:50.999
- I would like to.
- You need eight inches.

21:50.999 --> 21:51.999
- I want to donate it.
- You need eight inches...

21:51.999 --> 21:53.999
- To donate.
- Is that eight inches?

21:53.999 --> 21:55.000
- Come here, Jax.
Let's check.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.999
- All right, fine.

21:57.999 --> 21:59.999
- Ew, dude.

21:59.999 --> 22:02.999
Oh, boy, here we go.

22:02.999 --> 22:05.999
I'm at a point where
I'm maturing...

22:05.999 --> 22:06.999
No, I'm good.
Let's do it!

22:06.999 --> 22:07.999
Just do it before
I change my mind.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.999
I just want to look a little bit
more professional now.

22:10.999 --> 22:12.999
Heh.
Uh-oh.

22:12.999 --> 22:13.999
So it's time.

22:13.999 --> 22:14.999
I'm ready.
- Okay, you ready?

22:14.999 --> 22:15.999
- I'm ready.
Oh!

22:17.999 --> 22:19.999
- Oh...oh...
- Aah!

22:19.999 --> 22:21.999
- Breathe, breathe, breathe.

22:21.999 --> 22:24.999
- Come on, come on.
- It's going, it's going.

22:24.999 --> 22:26.999
- And she's done.

22:26.999 --> 22:27.999
- Whoo!

22:27.999 --> 22:29.999
- Oh, okay, I'm good, guys.

22:30.999 --> 22:31.999
- Oh, my God.

22:31.999 --> 22:32.999
- When I started working at Sur,

22:32.999 --> 22:34.999
your hair was like that.

22:34.999 --> 22:35.999
- Okay, I got a question
for you.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.999
What the hell happened
the other night

22:37.999 --> 22:40.999
when James came up to me
and he was DJing

22:40.999 --> 22:41.999
and then he had to go outside?

22:41.999 --> 22:43.999
- Yeah, it--
- Dude, they've broken up,

22:43.999 --> 22:46.999
like--they break up really messy
every single time.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.999
- As far as I know,
James cheated on Kristen.

22:48.999 --> 22:50.999
I mean, he hooked up with Lala

22:50.999 --> 22:51.999
while he was dating Kristen,

22:51.999 --> 22:54.999
so, I mean, for once,
I'm not in trouble, so...

22:54.999 --> 22:55.999
it's interesting.

22:55.999 --> 23:00.999
Uh, Scheana, Katie, and myself
are going to have drinks,

23:00.999 --> 23:04.999
and we invited Kristen along.

23:04.999 --> 23:05.999
- I thought you guys were
getting drinks

23:05.999 --> 23:07.999
with James and Lala
or something.

23:07.999 --> 23:09.999
- We are.

23:09.999 --> 23:10.999
- There's a large part of me
that doesn't feel like

23:10.999 --> 23:13.999
Jax will ever have
an adult relationship

23:13.999 --> 23:16.999
because he just loves to
f***ing stir up conflict.

23:16.999 --> 23:18.999
- I talked to Katie and Scheana
about it.

23:18.999 --> 23:20.999
I think Scheana and Katie
also want to

23:20.999 --> 23:22.999
just kind of see
how she's doing.

23:22.999 --> 23:25.999
- The reason why me and Ariana's
relationship is strong

23:25.999 --> 23:29.999
is because we remove ourselves
from that conflict

23:29.999 --> 23:31.999
that Jax is so addicted to.

23:31.999 --> 23:33.999
- No matter how crazy she is,

23:33.999 --> 23:36.999
deep down inside I still have
a soft spot for the poor girl.

23:36.999 --> 23:37.999
- I do.

23:37.999 --> 23:39.999
- I just feel like
Jax needs to grow up.

23:39.999 --> 23:45.999
She has no self-awareness
or self-control.

23:45.999 --> 23:47.999
I'm--it's gonna create distance.

23:47.999 --> 23:50.999
- This has nothing to do
with you and Ariana.

23:50.999 --> 23:51.999
This is more about
Lala and James.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.999
Katie and Scheana do have some
choice words for Lala.

23:55.999 --> 23:56.999
That being said--
- And so you guys are

23:56.999 --> 23:58.999
bringing in Kristen.
- Oh!

23:58.999 --> 23:59.999
- That--
- Honestly--honestly,

23:59.999 --> 24:01.999
I think throwing Lala in there

24:01.999 --> 24:03.999
is like bringing a catfish
into a shark pin.

24:03.999 --> 24:04.999
- Okay, but mind you,

24:04.999 --> 24:06.999
we're not coming into
an enclosed room.

24:06.999 --> 24:07.999
It's a--it's a club.

24:07.999 --> 24:09.999
If they want to get up
and walk away,

24:09.999 --> 24:10.999
they're more than welcome to.

24:10.999 --> 24:11.999
- Well...
- If Kristen's around,

24:11.999 --> 24:13.999
there's probably gonna be
some yelling and fighting.

24:13.999 --> 24:16.999
You know you can still die
from nuclear fallout.

24:16.999 --> 24:17.999
- Yeah, that's true.
I know.

24:17.999 --> 24:19.999
- Even if the bomb doesn't go
off right in front of you,

24:19.999 --> 24:21.999
so, no,
I don't want to be there.

24:21.999 --> 24:23.999
My mom used to say, it's like,
"I don't give a sh**.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.999
"I don't take sh**.

24:25.999 --> 24:26.999
Because I'm not
in the sh** business."

24:26.999 --> 24:29.999
Well, I'm not in the Kristen
business anymore, either.

24:29.999 --> 24:31.000
Well, have fun.

24:31.999 --> 24:32.999
- So, what do you guys think?

24:32.999 --> 24:33.999
- I think you look great.
- It's great, man.

24:33.999 --> 24:34.999
Look at--let's look at this.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.999
Look at this.
- Look at this.

24:36.999 --> 24:37.999
- I think it looks damn good.
- Yeah!

24:37.999 --> 24:39.999
- I like it, man.
- You did a good job.

24:39.999 --> 24:40.999
- Yeah.

25:03.999 --> 25:04.999

25:04.999 --> 25:06.999
- I thought you were
getting a pedicure.

25:06.999 --> 25:07.999
- I am.
- Why did you wear tennis shoes?

25:07.999 --> 25:09.999
- Because I didn't want to
show my toes yet.

25:09.999 --> 25:10.999
Duh.

25:13.999 --> 25:14.999
- So what do you guys want
to get today?

25:14.999 --> 25:16.999
- Pedicure.
- Pedicure.

25:16.999 --> 25:17.999
- I'm getting a gel manicure.

25:17.999 --> 25:18.999
- Okay.

25:18.999 --> 25:19.999
- Pretty.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.999

25:24.999 --> 25:28.000
- Jodi blew my phone up
last night.

25:28.999 --> 25:30.999
- Yeah, Kristen texts me,
just like,

25:30.999 --> 25:32.999
"Oh," like, "that bitch Lala"
or whatever.

25:32.999 --> 25:33.999
- Yeah,
'cause it's Lala's fault.

25:33.999 --> 25:35.999
- Yeah, she's like, "That bitch
better not f***ing cross me."

25:35.999 --> 25:36.999
- But does she even know?

25:36.999 --> 25:38.999
- Of course she knows.

25:38.999 --> 25:40.999
- But, hey, did James tell her
that they broke up?

25:40.999 --> 25:42.999
- How many times have
they broken up?

25:42.999 --> 25:44.999
- Oh, okay,
so they broke up for a day,

25:44.999 --> 25:45.999
so it's okay to
hop in bed with him?

25:45.999 --> 25:46.999
- Well, what is she
supposed to know?

25:46.999 --> 25:48.999
- I don't think she knows
that they do this.

25:48.999 --> 25:49.999
- Like, I'm not trying to, like,

25:49.999 --> 25:51.999
totally stick up
for Kristen here,

25:51.999 --> 25:53.999
but that's not someone
I want to be friends with.

25:53.999 --> 25:56.999
Like, Lala, this is why
we're not welcoming you

25:56.999 --> 25:59.999
into our group,
because you're that type of girl

25:59.999 --> 26:01.999
who does go after
other women's boyfriends.

26:01.999 --> 26:03.999
That's not cool with us.

26:03.999 --> 26:05.999
- So, Scheana, did you and Shay

26:05.999 --> 26:07.999
start talking about, like,

26:07.999 --> 26:09.999
what you're gonna do next?
- Like, a plan of action?

26:09.999 --> 26:11.999
- I kind of wanted to just--

26:11.999 --> 26:14.999
I mean, I felt like--

26:14.999 --> 26:16.999
just, like, liberated
and so happy and, like,

26:16.999 --> 26:18.999
this huge weight was, like,
lifted off my shoulders.

26:18.999 --> 26:20.999
I'm like,
let's just have a happy day.

26:20.999 --> 26:22.999
Let's pretend like
the last week didn't happen,

26:22.999 --> 26:24.999
and let's just, like,

26:24.999 --> 26:27.999
go back to us the day
we got back from our honeymoon.

26:27.999 --> 26:29.999
- My concern with Scheana
is that

26:29.999 --> 26:31.999
she doesn't always like to
deal with things head-on.

26:31.999 --> 26:33.999
These are some
pretty major issues

26:33.999 --> 26:35.999
that are going on
in the relationship

26:35.999 --> 26:36.999
that really
need to be addressed,

26:36.999 --> 26:38.999
and they take time.

26:38.999 --> 26:39.999
I love you and Shay,

26:39.999 --> 26:43.999
but I do think
these issues are serious issues.

26:43.999 --> 26:44.999
- Oh, absolutely.

26:44.999 --> 26:46.999
I mean, I think he knows

26:46.999 --> 26:47.999
how serious this is

26:47.999 --> 26:50.999
and how close he's been,
not once but now twice,

26:51.000 --> 26:52.999
to losing me.

26:52.999 --> 26:54.999
I literally said to him,

26:54.999 --> 26:58.999
"If you ever take one more pill
for the rest of your life,

26:58.999 --> 27:01.999
"I don't care if every bone
in your f***ing body is broken,

27:01.999 --> 27:03.999
"I will file for divorce.

27:03.999 --> 27:06.999
"So, it's pills or marriage.

27:06.999 --> 27:08.999
You don't get both."

27:08.999 --> 27:10.999
I really don't think
he's gonna f*** up again.

27:10.999 --> 27:12.999
I think he's gonna do
everything in his power

27:12.999 --> 27:16.999
to make me
the happiest woman alive.

27:16.999 --> 27:19.999
- What concerns me is when
Scheana's saying that

27:19.999 --> 27:22.999
they're pretending like this
last week never happened,

27:22.999 --> 27:25.999
I worry that
that will become a pattern,

27:25.999 --> 27:29.999
and they won't truly address
these things

27:29.999 --> 27:32.999
that got them to the place
that they're in right now.

27:32.999 --> 27:33.999
- No, I know--
- Both of you need to be

27:33.999 --> 27:36.999
the happiest people alive.
- Yeah, exactly.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.999
- Jax told Kristen
about us already.

27:39.999 --> 27:41.999
- Is she the type of bitch
that's gonna, like,

27:41.999 --> 27:44.999
show up at my door and, like,
pick my lock?

27:52.999 --> 27:55.999

27:58.999 --> 27:59.999

28:11.999 --> 28:12.999
- Yeah, me too.

28:12.999 --> 28:14.999
I haven't eaten anything
all day.

28:14.999 --> 28:15.999
- No? Me too.
- No.

28:15.999 --> 28:16.999
I've had water.

28:16.999 --> 28:17.999
I'm on that model diet.

28:17.999 --> 28:18.999
- A water diet?
- Is that why

28:18.999 --> 28:20.999
you brought me here?
To put an ass on a girl?

28:20.999 --> 28:21.999
- Maybe a little bit.
Maybe a little bit.

28:21.999 --> 28:23.999
- Yeah.
- Hi, guys, how are you?

28:23.999 --> 28:24.999
- Hi, darling, how are you?

28:24.999 --> 28:25.999
- Welcome to
Cassell's Hamburgers.

28:25.999 --> 28:26.999
- Thank you.
- Here you guys go.

28:26.999 --> 28:28.999
There's our bar menu for you.

28:28.999 --> 28:29.999
And you guys are just in time
for happy hour.

28:29.999 --> 28:31.999
- Cool, oh, I like that.
- Ooh, we like that.

28:31.999 --> 28:32.999
- There you guys go.
- That Saint Archer looks

28:32.999 --> 28:33.999
all right.
Let's try that.

28:33.999 --> 28:34.999
- All right.
And how about you?

28:34.999 --> 28:36.999
- I would love
a vodka soda, please.

28:36.999 --> 28:37.999
- Yeah.
- Yes, thank you.

28:37.999 --> 28:38.999
- Thank you so much.
- I'll be right with you.

28:38.999 --> 28:40.999
- Cheers.

28:40.999 --> 28:41.999
Glad you said yes
to coming out with me.

28:41.999 --> 28:43.999
I was kind of nervous
when I was asking you out,

28:43.999 --> 28:45.999
to be honest.
- I was nervous, like,

28:45.999 --> 28:46.999
all day today.

28:46.999 --> 28:47.999
- Really?
- I can't even remember

28:47.999 --> 28:50.999
the last time I've been, like,
on a date with somebody.

28:50.999 --> 28:52.999
- You're a beautiful,
beautiful woman.

28:52.999 --> 28:53.999
- Thank you.
- Like, I'm very surprised.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.999
- You gotta stop that.

28:55.999 --> 28:57.999
You're making me blush.

28:57.999 --> 28:58.999
You're, like,
completely different

28:58.999 --> 29:01.999
from any dude I've ever
been with in my whole life.

29:01.999 --> 29:02.999
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:02.999 --> 29:05.999
If you were to take every guy
I've ever been with

29:05.999 --> 29:06.999
and then James,

29:06.999 --> 29:10.999
he's on the completely other end
of the spectrum.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.999
I usually go in on some steak,

29:12.999 --> 29:16.999
but, I mean,
I'm liking the string bean.

29:16.999 --> 29:17.999
- I'm mostly DJing now,
which is great.

29:17.999 --> 29:18.999
- Yeah, I'm proud of you.

29:18.999 --> 29:19.999
- You ought to come over.

29:19.999 --> 29:20.999
Let's make a track together.

29:20.999 --> 29:21.999
- I want to.
- Yeah?

29:21.999 --> 29:23.999
- Yeah.
- Well, cheers to that.

29:23.999 --> 29:25.999
- Cheers to making music
and babies.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.999
- Cool.

29:28.000 --> 29:28.999
- That's a joke, James.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.999
Don't get too hyped.

29:31.999 --> 29:32.999
- f*** you.

29:32.999 --> 29:35.999
All I'm thinking about is
Lala Lala.

29:35.999 --> 29:38.999
- Um, so, let's talk about this
real quick.

29:38.999 --> 29:39.999
You and--you and this girl.

29:39.999 --> 29:41.999
- Yeah, Kristen.

29:41.999 --> 29:42.999
It's officially over, Lala.
You know what I mean?

29:42.999 --> 29:44.999
I wouldn't be out with you
right now if it wasn't.

29:44.999 --> 29:46.999
I'm not trying to, you know,
go behind Kristen's back.

29:46.999 --> 29:48.999
I set her straight up,
you know.

29:48.999 --> 29:50.999
I heard old Jaxy boy
couldn't keep his mouth shut.

29:50.999 --> 29:53.999
So, he obviously told Kristen
about us already.

29:53.999 --> 29:55.999
- Is she the type of bitch
that's gonna, like,

29:55.999 --> 29:57.999
show up at my door and, like,
pick my lock?

29:57.999 --> 29:59.999
- No, no, no.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.999
But she might confront you.

30:01.999 --> 30:03.000
And you're ready for that, babe.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
- If Kristen tried to
step to me,

30:05.000 --> 30:06.999
she has another thing coming.

30:06.999 --> 30:09.999
She messes with--with
these little softies.

30:09.999 --> 30:10.999
If she tried to step to me,

30:10.999 --> 30:12.999
there would be
a very large problem for her.

30:12.999 --> 30:14.999
- Can we stop talking about
Kristen now, please?

30:14.999 --> 30:16.999
- Yeah, no, we're--we're good.
- Thank you.

30:16.999 --> 30:18.999
Gonna talk about you now.

30:30.999 --> 30:32.999
- Hey!
- You guys are already--hi.

30:32.999 --> 30:33.999
You guys are already
getting lit on this?

30:33.999 --> 30:35.999
- Yes.
- Are you drinking today?

30:35.999 --> 30:36.999
- I'm sitting in the back.

30:36.999 --> 30:38.999
- Back of the class, Kay-Kay?
- Yeah.

30:38.999 --> 30:40.000
I do feel like
we're in class.

30:40.999 --> 30:41.999
- Wait, right?
- This is the best class.

30:41.999 --> 30:43.999
- Oh, my God, I hope--
- Did you do your homework?

30:43.999 --> 30:45.999
- I know nothing about wine.

30:45.999 --> 30:46.999
- Hello.

30:46.999 --> 30:47.999
Hi.

30:47.999 --> 30:49.999
- So, this is Laz.

30:49.999 --> 30:50.999
- Hi.
- Hi, how is everybody?

30:50.999 --> 30:53.999
- And he works--he works with
Pandora and Jason.

30:53.999 --> 30:54.999
And he is a sommelier,

30:54.999 --> 30:57.999
so he's very kindly decided to
come here today--

30:57.999 --> 31:01.999
because I've begged him--
and educate you.

31:01.999 --> 31:03.999
A sommelier is a wine expert.

31:03.999 --> 31:06.999
A great meal is complimented

31:06.999 --> 31:09.999
by a right choice of wine.

31:09.999 --> 31:11.999
I don't want these kids
to go out with a steak

31:11.999 --> 31:14.999
and try and serve somebody
a Diet Coke.

31:14.999 --> 31:16.999
Can I have a steak?

31:16.999 --> 31:19.999
And I'd like a full-bodied
red wine with that.

31:19.999 --> 31:21.999
What red wine would you suggest?

31:21.999 --> 31:24.999
- Um...my favorite red,
it would be the pinot noir.

31:24.999 --> 31:26.999
- That's not a full-bodied.

31:26.999 --> 31:27.999
Have you looked at
the wine menu?

31:27.999 --> 31:29.999
- I have.
I have.

31:29.999 --> 31:31.999
- You need to understand that
thoroughly.

31:31.999 --> 31:33.999
- Looking at food and wine
pairings,

31:33.999 --> 31:35.999
especially in an establishment
like this,

31:35.999 --> 31:36.999
there are no
hard and fast rules.

31:36.999 --> 31:38.999
You know, what are
the dominant characteristics

31:38.999 --> 31:41.999
of the food that they're picking
or that you're suggesting?

31:41.999 --> 31:43.999
Today, I know we're gonna try
some different foods.

31:43.999 --> 31:45.999
Katie, what would you suggest

31:45.999 --> 31:47.999
with the lobster quinoa salad?

31:47.999 --> 31:49.999
- Champagne or chardonnay?

31:49.999 --> 31:51.999
- I don't mind that choice,
actually.

31:51.999 --> 31:53.999
- Mm.
- The food is absolutely

31:53.999 --> 31:55.999
fantastic at Sur.

31:55.999 --> 31:56.999
- Can I go like this
and open it?

31:56.999 --> 31:58.999
- No, we don't want anything
between your legs.

31:58.999 --> 32:02.999
I need to make sure the service
is equal to the food.

32:02.999 --> 32:04.999
- Short one?
Little bit.

32:04.999 --> 32:06.999
- Mm-hmm.
- Long one.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.999
I think she just opened

32:08.999 --> 32:09.999
a few bottles, Lisa.

32:09.999 --> 32:10.999
- It's about
the diners' experience,

32:10.999 --> 32:12.999
and that's really important
to me.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.999
Well, thanks for
giving me your time.

32:14.999 --> 32:16.999
And thank you, Laz for...
- No, thank you.

32:16.999 --> 32:17.999
Thank you, everyone.
- For being here.

32:17.999 --> 32:19.999
All right,
you can take the food with you

32:19.999 --> 32:20.999
if you want--yeah, yeah, go, go.

32:20.999 --> 32:22.999
- One more bite.

32:22.999 --> 32:24.999
- I'll get--I'll just help
clear this away for you.

32:24.999 --> 32:26.999
- No, you leave the drink
on the table.

32:26.999 --> 32:28.999
You can take the food.

32:28.999 --> 32:29.999
Go on.
- Can I just eat both?

32:29.999 --> 32:31.999
Katie, do you want to
have the balls?

32:31.999 --> 32:32.999
Thank you.

32:32.999 --> 32:33.999
I really want one of those.

32:33.999 --> 32:35.999
- That was the first time
you've heard that.

32:35.999 --> 32:37.999
Yes, darling?
- This is probably

32:37.999 --> 32:38.999
the first time I've been at Sur

32:38.999 --> 32:40.999
and there are free goat cheese
balls in front of me

32:40.999 --> 32:41.999
and I haven't eaten one.

32:41.999 --> 32:43.999
- Don't you just love that?

32:43.999 --> 32:47.999
So, how was the healthy eating
experience?

32:47.999 --> 32:49.000
- Yeah, I don't want egg whites.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.999
I want eggs.

32:50.999 --> 32:51.999
- Ah.
- And bacon.

32:51.999 --> 32:52.999
But I mean,
we're finally, like,

32:52.999 --> 32:54.999
Shay and I have been
going to the gym together,

32:54.999 --> 32:57.999
and we're just starting to
kind of pick our--

32:57.999 --> 32:58.999
- How's it going with him?

32:59.000 --> 33:00.999
- It's better.

33:00.999 --> 33:01.999
It's definitely better.

33:01.999 --> 33:03.999
It's not 100% yet.

33:03.999 --> 33:05.999
There are a lot of things
we still need to work on.

33:05.999 --> 33:07.999
- Mm-hmm.
Where--where is he working?

33:08.000 --> 33:09.999
- Well, he's not working
at all.

33:09.999 --> 33:11.999
Like, he's just trying to
figure it all out.

33:11.999 --> 33:12.999
- Okay.

33:12.999 --> 33:15.999
- I mean, we've kind of been
working more on our marriage

33:15.999 --> 33:17.999
right now and less on
the employment--

33:17.999 --> 33:18.999
- Yeah, but you're working.

33:18.999 --> 33:19.999
- I can cover the bills
just fine.

33:19.999 --> 33:20.999
I mean, working full-time--

33:20.999 --> 33:22.999
- Yeah, sure,
but resentment will build up

33:22.999 --> 33:24.999
if you feel that
he's not pulling his weight.

33:24.999 --> 33:26.999
Trust me on that one.

33:26.999 --> 33:29.999
Scheana went into this marriage
thinking she was marrying Shay.

33:29.999 --> 33:30.999
But she wasn't.

33:30.999 --> 33:33.999
She was marrying Shay
who was addicted to drugs.

33:33.999 --> 33:35.999
That's a very different
scenario.

33:35.999 --> 33:37.999
- I mean,
I'm trying to support him.

33:37.999 --> 33:39.999
And I'm just trying to
be there for him,

33:39.999 --> 33:41.999
so...whatever he wants to do
I'm gonna support that.

33:41.999 --> 33:45.999
- Listen, I know I don't have to
tell you to be supportive.

33:45.999 --> 33:46.999
I don't have to
tell you to be kind.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.999
I don't have to tell you
any of those things.

33:48.999 --> 33:50.999
'Cause I know who you are
and I know you're a good girl,

33:50.999 --> 33:52.999
and I know you're gonna be
a good wife.

33:52.999 --> 33:55.999
However, I might have to tell
you that you can be tough on him

33:55.999 --> 33:59.999
and couple it with love
and kick his ass.

33:59.999 --> 34:01.999
Trust me.

34:01.999 --> 34:02.999
- Yeah.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.999
- Don't make excuses for him,
though.

34:05.999 --> 34:08.999
My God, you don't think in
33 years of marriage

34:08.999 --> 34:11.999
there were moments when
I wanted to run for the hills?

34:11.999 --> 34:12.999
Of course.

34:12.999 --> 34:13.999
- Yeah.
- Things get too much.

34:13.999 --> 34:16.999
You think, "I didn't sign up
for this."

34:16.999 --> 34:17.999
But that's what marriage is.

34:17.999 --> 34:19.999
- I mean,
it's not the easiest thing,

34:19.999 --> 34:23.999
but...he's trying.

34:23.999 --> 34:24.999
- As long as he's trying
as hard as you are.

34:24.999 --> 34:26.999
- Yeah.

34:29.999 --> 34:31.999
- James has said
so much sh** about you.

34:31.999 --> 34:33.999
He's like, "She's a slut.
She's a whore."

34:41.999 --> 34:43.999
♪ A-whoo-ooh ♪

34:43.999 --> 34:46.999
♪ A-whoo-ooh-ah ♪

34:46.999 --> 34:49.999
♪ Creatures of the night ♪

34:49.999 --> 34:50.999
♪ A-whoo-ooh ♪

34:50.999 --> 34:54.999
♪ A-whoo-ooh-ah ♪

34:54.999 --> 34:55.999
- Come on, guys.

34:55.999 --> 34:56.999
Gotta move here a little bit.

34:56.999 --> 34:58.999
I know, I need a drink.

34:58.999 --> 34:59.999
- For sure.

35:02.999 --> 35:03.999
- I feel like
we should all get a shot.

35:03.999 --> 35:04.999
- I don't want to take a shot.

35:04.999 --> 35:07.999
- Why?
- I don't like shots.

35:07.999 --> 35:09.999
- Hey!
- Hi!

35:09.999 --> 35:11.999
- How are you?
- I didn't see you.

35:11.999 --> 35:13.999
- How are you?
- Good.

35:13.999 --> 35:16.999
- You need a drink?
- Yeah, I need, like, 20 drinks.

35:17.999 --> 35:18.999
- Can I get just
a pineapple vodka?

35:18.999 --> 35:20.999
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

35:20.999 --> 35:23.999
- Can I get a tequila
with pineapple soda?

35:23.999 --> 35:24.999
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

35:24.999 --> 35:25.999
- Yeah.
- Tequila crazy.

35:25.999 --> 35:27.999
- Can I get a citron and soda

35:27.999 --> 35:28.999
with a couple lemons, please?

35:28.999 --> 35:30.999
- Regular soda?
- Yeah.

35:30.999 --> 35:31.999
My options tonight were

35:31.999 --> 35:34.999
stay at home and watch TV
with my husband,

35:34.999 --> 35:38.999
or go out and watch
the Kristen show live.

35:38.999 --> 35:40.000
That's what I want to do.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.999
- Hey!
- What's up, guys?

35:41.999 --> 35:43.000
- Hi.
- Hi!

35:43.000 --> 35:44.999
- You guys know Lala, right?

35:44.999 --> 35:47.999
- I know there's gonna be
endless amounts of alcohol

35:47.999 --> 35:49.999
at our table,
so that's not really

35:49.999 --> 35:51.999
what Shay needs right now.

35:51.999 --> 35:53.999
He's happy home on the couch
with his remote control.

35:53.999 --> 35:56.999
So, wait, are you guys, like,
dating now or what...?

35:56.999 --> 35:57.999
- We're just having fun.

35:57.999 --> 35:58.999
- What is this?

35:58.999 --> 35:59.999
- I'm having fun.
I'm happy.

35:59.999 --> 36:00.999
And I f***ing feel great.

36:00.999 --> 36:01.999
- So, I get that,

36:02.000 --> 36:03.999
but I just wanted to
get to know you more.

36:03.999 --> 36:04.999
I wanted to
ask you some questions.

36:04.999 --> 36:06.999
I've heard a lot of stuff.

36:06.999 --> 36:07.999
- What did you hear?
That I made out with somebody?

36:07.999 --> 36:09.000
I'm just--
- While him and Kristen were

36:09.999 --> 36:10.999
still together.
- They had a breakup.

36:10.999 --> 36:12.999
We've made out
and been on a date.

36:12.999 --> 36:13.999
This is nothing serious.

36:13.999 --> 36:14.999
- Yeah.
- If they got back together

36:14.999 --> 36:16.999
tomorrow,
it is what it is.

36:16.999 --> 36:18.999
- It's not really hard to
embarrass James.

36:18.999 --> 36:19.999
He kind of does it on his own.

36:19.999 --> 36:22.999
But it's just so much better

36:22.999 --> 36:24.999
watching Scheana embarrass him

36:24.999 --> 36:25.999
in front of Lala.

36:25.999 --> 36:27.999
- It's all just
fun and games, man.

36:27.999 --> 36:28.999
- See how chill?
See, this is exactly

36:28.999 --> 36:30.999
what I want right now, guys.
- Yeah, I am.

36:30.999 --> 36:33.999
- This is exactly
what I need right now, okay?

36:33.999 --> 36:35.999
- Hi.

36:35.999 --> 36:36.999
- Hi.
- Hello.

36:36.999 --> 36:39.999
- You f***ers.
You f***ers.

36:39.999 --> 36:42.999
- I didn't even think any of
these people liked Kristen.

36:42.999 --> 36:44.999
Why is she here?

36:44.999 --> 36:46.999
Something's wrong
with this picture.

36:46.999 --> 36:47.999
- Let me get you a drink.

36:47.999 --> 36:49.999
- Yes, please.
- What would you like?

36:49.999 --> 36:52.999
- Oh, look who's best friends
with Jax again.

36:52.999 --> 36:53.999
That was quick.
- I'm gonna need, like,

36:53.999 --> 36:55.999
30 f***ing drinks.
- Listen, listen.

36:55.999 --> 36:56.999
That's why I was saying...

36:56.999 --> 36:59.999
- Are you gonna start sleeping
with Kristen again, Jaxy boy?

36:59.999 --> 37:00.999
- Don't do that.
- Why?

37:00.999 --> 37:02.999
- Because she's here right now.
- My God, my--

37:02.999 --> 37:03.999
- Have respect for people,
please.

37:03.999 --> 37:04.999
- Are you f***ing kidding me?

37:04.999 --> 37:07.999
- No.
Right now you need to.

37:07.999 --> 37:09.999
- You're no fun.

37:09.999 --> 37:10.999
Someone ain't no fun anymore.

37:10.999 --> 37:12.999
- I'm always fun,
but at the same time...

37:12.999 --> 37:13.999
- No, you're not.
You're not being fun right now.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.999
I'm--I'm a woman,
she's a woman,

37:15.999 --> 37:17.999
and I know what it's like
to love somebody.

37:17.999 --> 37:19.999
- All right, whatever.
- Okay.

37:19.999 --> 37:20.999
- All right, I'll take you
outside for a second.

37:20.999 --> 37:21.999
- Yeah, yeah.
- You wanna go outside

37:21.999 --> 37:22.999
and have a conversation?
- She likes that idea, yeah.

37:22.999 --> 37:23.999
She likes that idea
a lot.

37:23.999 --> 37:26.999
- Oh, James, James, come on.
- James!

37:29.999 --> 37:30.999
- Enjoy.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.999
- So...happy Friday.
- So.

37:32.999 --> 37:34.999
- Yeah.
- You don't think

37:34.999 --> 37:36.999
she's gonna try and f*** Jax?
- Oh, my God, James, no.

37:36.999 --> 37:38.999
- It's just funny how
she moves in on him that quick.

37:38.999 --> 37:39.999
- She's not moving in on him!

37:39.999 --> 37:40.999
- She's not moving in on him!

37:41.000 --> 37:42.999
- May--you care, James.
- f*** off.

37:42.999 --> 37:43.999
- You still care, James.

37:43.999 --> 37:44.999
- James, this is why you care.
- He acts like

37:44.999 --> 37:46.999
such a f***ing child.

37:46.999 --> 37:49.999
- James clearly is still
emotionally invested in Kristen.

37:49.999 --> 37:51.999
- You guys got a lighter?

37:51.999 --> 37:53.999
- I'm not being thrown in
the middle of this sh** show.

37:53.999 --> 37:55.999
- The girls are
in defense mode of you.

37:55.999 --> 37:57.999
They're right off the bat
attacking Lala, attacking Lala.

37:57.999 --> 37:59.999
- The reason they don't like her
is because of

37:59.999 --> 38:00.999
the way she presents herself.

38:00.999 --> 38:01.999
- Right.
- And that's

38:01.999 --> 38:02.999
her f***ing problem.

38:02.999 --> 38:05.999
- Honest to God,
when I saw her sit down

38:05.999 --> 38:06.999
and James, like,
put his arm around me,

38:06.999 --> 38:08.999
I was like, have respect.

38:08.999 --> 38:09.999
- He doesn't, though.

38:09.999 --> 38:12.999
He has zero respect.

38:13.999 --> 38:15.999
- I think you should.
- Yeah.

38:15.999 --> 38:18.999
- She's a big girl.
She'll be fine.

38:18.999 --> 38:21.000
- I just rid baggage
that I didn't need.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.999
- Okay.
- I thought I was sad about him.

38:23.999 --> 38:25.999
I really wasn't.
It was just--

38:25.999 --> 38:27.999
he was my rebound
from Sandoval.

38:27.999 --> 38:29.999
I thought it was
more than that.

38:29.999 --> 38:30.999
- He's talking right now--
- But now I've kind of, like,

38:30.999 --> 38:33.999
stepped outside the box,
and I'm like, really?

38:33.999 --> 38:35.999
You are a joke.
He's a douche.

38:35.999 --> 38:37.999
- Hi, guys.
- I know.

38:37.999 --> 38:38.999
Oh, hey.
- Am I interrupting something?

38:38.999 --> 38:39.999
- No, not at all.
- Can I...chat with her--?

38:39.999 --> 38:41.999
- You know what,
you can take my spot.

38:41.999 --> 38:44.999
I'll see you guys in a minute.

38:44.999 --> 38:45.999
- I'm Lala.

38:45.999 --> 38:47.000
- Kristen.
Nice to meet you.

38:47.999 --> 38:48.999
- Very nice to meet you.

38:48.999 --> 38:49.999
- I know, I'm like--
you're the one I talked to

38:49.999 --> 38:51.999
sort of the other night,
right, at Sur?

38:51.999 --> 38:53.999
- Yeah.
- That's what I thought.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.000
- Um...so I'm kind of
just wanting to

38:56.000 --> 39:00.999
get a little bit of, you know,
girl-on-girl clarification.

39:00.999 --> 39:04.999
- I've heard that
you hooked up with James

39:04.999 --> 39:07.000
when we were still together,
when I was out of town.

39:07.999 --> 39:08.999
Kind of leaves me
in a weird place.

39:08.999 --> 39:09.999
- Well, that's where
I'm gonna stop you.

39:09.999 --> 39:10.999
- Okay.
- Because he told me

39:10.999 --> 39:11.999
you guys had broken up.

39:11.999 --> 39:13.999
- Ooh, well,
we were very much together.

39:13.999 --> 39:17.999
- Okay, so, obviously
somebody lied.

39:17.999 --> 39:19.999
So--
- So, he cheated on me.

39:19.999 --> 39:21.000
Yeah.

39:21.999 --> 39:22.999
What bugged me about it
being you

39:22.999 --> 39:25.999
is that James has said
so much sh** about you.

39:25.999 --> 39:26.999
He was like,
"Oh, there's a new girl at Sur."

39:27.000 --> 39:28.999
- Yeah.
- He mentioned Faith,

39:28.999 --> 39:29.999
and then he was like, "Oh,
there's this girl named Lala."

39:30.000 --> 39:31.999
- Yeah.
- He's like, "She's a slut.

39:31.999 --> 39:33.999
She's a whore."
He was like,

39:33.999 --> 39:35.999
"Yeah, she comes up to me
and she's like, 'Hey, James,

39:35.999 --> 39:36.999
I look slutty today,'

39:36.999 --> 39:37.999
or like, 'Do you like
my slutty outfit tonight?'"

39:38.000 --> 39:39.999
- What the f***?

39:39.999 --> 39:44.999
James was texting me long before
Kristen and he broke up.

39:44.999 --> 39:46.999
So, my theory is,

39:46.999 --> 39:48.999
he didn't want to admit that
he had a crush on me,

39:48.999 --> 39:50.999
but to cover his own ass,
if Kristen did find out

39:50.999 --> 39:53.999
that he was being
overly friendly,

39:53.999 --> 39:55.999
no, just call Lala
a whore and a slut

39:55.999 --> 39:57.999
and it makes everything okay.

39:57.999 --> 39:59.999
- And he's like, "Oh, she's just
a slut, she's a whore,

39:59.999 --> 40:00.999
whatever."
And I'm like,

40:00.999 --> 40:02.999
"Well, that's not cool,"
like...

40:02.999 --> 40:04.999
- No, I would agree with you.

40:04.999 --> 40:05.999
- Hi, guys.

40:05.999 --> 40:06.999
Can I sit in the middle
over here?

40:06.999 --> 40:08.999
Yeah, that's rich.

40:08.999 --> 40:10.999
- I really don't want to
talk to you.

40:10.999 --> 40:11.999
- No, I wanna know
what you guys--

40:11.999 --> 40:13.999
- I think we're both
on the same page right now.

40:13.999 --> 40:14.999
- Yeah, right?

40:14.999 --> 40:16.999
- Why, what has she
told you now?

40:16.999 --> 40:19.999
- Well, I'm actually
very offended, so...

40:19.999 --> 40:21.999
- Why?
- I'm going to excuse myself.

40:21.999 --> 40:22.999
- Wait, with me?
- Yeah.

40:22.999 --> 40:24.999
- I feel like I'm on another
wavelength, so I--

40:24.999 --> 40:25.999
- Are you guys
f***ing kidding me?

40:25.999 --> 40:27.999
How do you do that?
- No, I'm, like, offended.

40:27.999 --> 40:29.999
It's f***--cheers.
Thank you for--yeah.

40:29.999 --> 40:32.999
Have a good one.

40:32.999 --> 40:34.999
- Are you f***ing kidding me,
Kristen?

40:34.999 --> 40:37.999
This is what you did?

40:37.999 --> 40:38.999
Oh, my f***ing God.

40:38.999 --> 40:40.999
This is f***ing bullsh**.

40:48.999 --> 40:50.999
- Just give me five minutes...
- No, no, no.

40:50.999 --> 40:51.999
- And then that's it?
- Nope, nope, nope, nope,

40:51.999 --> 40:52.999
nope, nope, nope.
We're not even going there

40:52.999 --> 40:54.999
right now.
I'm like,

40:54.999 --> 40:56.999
really f***ing offended.

40:56.999 --> 40:57.999
- Kristen, what did you say?
I want to know.

40:57.999 --> 40:58.999
- Don't worry about
what she said,

40:58.999 --> 41:01.999
because I know exactly
what she's talking about,

41:01.999 --> 41:03.999
and the way you are
making me sound to people,

41:03.999 --> 41:05.999
I'm offended.
I thought you were being real.

41:05.999 --> 41:06.999
- I didn't say--what did I say?

41:06.999 --> 41:07.999
- You said last night,
"I have your back."

41:07.999 --> 41:08.999
- I was being real.
I do have your back.

41:08.999 --> 41:09.999
- You don't have my back.

41:09.999 --> 41:11.999
- What the f***
did she tell you, Lala?

41:11.999 --> 41:12.999
This is bullsh**.

41:12.999 --> 41:14.999
You're being a f***ing
basic bitch right now.

41:14.999 --> 41:15.999
- Oh--oh!
- That's what you're doing.

41:15.999 --> 41:17.999
- Oh!
- 'Cause you listened to her.

41:17.999 --> 41:18.999
You listened to her.

41:18.999 --> 41:19.999
- Did you just say
she's being a bitch?

41:19.999 --> 41:21.999
- No, basic.
- A basic bitch.

41:21.999 --> 41:22.999
- She listens to Kristen
for five minutes

41:22.999 --> 41:24.999
and then
she goes against me.

41:24.999 --> 41:27.000
- I know I'm not a slut.
I know I'm not a whore.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
Because obviously I'm not
getting paid to have sex--

41:30.000 --> 41:31.999
which would be dope.

41:31.999 --> 41:34.999
But I know for damn sure
that I'm not basic.

41:34.999 --> 41:36.999
- You don't talk to women
like that, James.

41:36.999 --> 41:37.999
- Why are you doing that?
Why is she doing that?

41:37.999 --> 41:38.999
- You don't--first of all,

41:38.999 --> 41:40.999
you don't speak to any woman
like that ever.

41:40.999 --> 41:43.999
It's so rude and degrading,

41:43.999 --> 41:45.999
and I'm so not a feminist.

41:45.999 --> 41:47.999
But stop.

41:47.999 --> 41:48.999
Seriously.

41:48.999 --> 41:49.999
It's so f***ing rude.

41:49.999 --> 41:51.000
It's so rude.

41:51.999 --> 41:53.999
I would never think that
I would actually be, like,

41:53.999 --> 41:57.000
rallying for Lala
and being on her side with this,

41:57.999 --> 41:58.999
but James is just wrong.

41:58.999 --> 42:00.999
- I don't even know
what you're talking about.

42:00.999 --> 42:01.999
- This night has taken a turn

42:01.999 --> 42:03.999
in a way I didn't think
was possible.

42:03.999 --> 42:04.999
- I feel like
I can f***ing break down.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.999
- How do you visit
with my ex-girlfriend?

42:06.999 --> 42:07.999
I knew that was gonna
f***ing happen.

42:07.999 --> 42:08.999
- No.
- That was before

42:08.999 --> 42:09.999
I was seeing you!
- You go back!

42:09.999 --> 42:11.000
- That was before.
Lala...

42:13.999 --> 42:14.999
- That's what I told her.

42:14.999 --> 42:15.999
- God.
- And that was before

42:15.999 --> 42:17.999
I even got to know you.

42:17.999 --> 42:19.999
There is no question that
Kristen came here

42:19.999 --> 42:20.999
to sabotage me and Lala.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.999
Honestly, I just think
Kristen's mad

42:22.999 --> 42:23.999
because Lala's so much
hotter than

42:23.999 --> 42:25.000
whatever piece of sh**
she was f***ing

42:25.999 --> 42:26.999
in Michigan the other night.

42:28.999 --> 42:30.999
- Honestly, God bless Kristen,
you know?

42:30.999 --> 42:32.999
When you get Kristen pointed in
the right direction,

42:32.999 --> 42:33.999
as long as it's not at me,

42:33.999 --> 42:35.999
she's kind of amazing to watch.

42:35.999 --> 42:38.999
Job well done to Jax.

42:40.999 --> 42:42.999
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:42.999 --> 42:43.999
Gay pride.

42:43.999 --> 42:45.000
Are you ready?

42:46.999 --> 42:48.999
One successful party this year
would be a failure.

42:48.999 --> 42:49.999
I need two.

42:49.999 --> 42:51.999
- You're here to get wasted.

42:52.999 --> 42:54.999
- I smell trouble.

42:54.999 --> 42:55.999
- Down...
- Oh...

42:55.999 --> 42:57.999
- Back up.
- Oh, that's a good one.

42:57.999 --> 42:58.999
- Push it, Shay, push it.

42:58.999 --> 43:00.999
- I feel like Shay
just needs a win.

43:02.999 --> 43:03.999
- What the hell is that?

43:03.999 --> 43:05.999
- I guess it's just battle
wounds

43:05.999 --> 43:06.999
from the bedroom last night.
- What's battle wounds?

43:06.999 --> 43:08.999
- Seven hours of sex, mate.

43:08.999 --> 43:09.999
With who?

43:09.999 --> 43:11.999
- I said
I would not be annoyed,

43:11.999 --> 43:12.999
but I actually am.
Bye.

43:12.999 --> 43:14.999
