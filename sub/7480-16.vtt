WEBVTT

00:04.208 --> 00:06.576
So you've never been dumped?

00:06.986 --> 00:08.353
What part of "never"
don't you understand?

00:08.421 --> 00:09.838
I don't believe you.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.823
Well, that's understandable
considering your track record.

00:11.874 --> 00:14.226
- But honestly, look at me, huh?
- Oh.

00:14.293 --> 00:16.294
I mean, how could you break up
with this, you know?

00:16.379 --> 00:19.548
I'm super fun, I'm like
365 days of heaven.

00:19.632 --> 00:20.549
Heaven?
See, I was thinking south

00:20.633 --> 00:23.185
and much, much,
much hotter.

00:23.269 --> 00:24.436
So, like, Mexico?

00:24.503 --> 00:27.672
Let me guess,
you're the "senses the breakup,

00:27.723 --> 00:29.674
initiates preemptive strike"
guy.

00:29.725 --> 00:30.725
Yeah, well,

00:30.810 --> 00:32.177
it's much better
to be the breaker

00:32.228 --> 00:33.895
than the breakee, I think.

00:33.980 --> 00:35.747
You're just broken, Deeks.

00:35.815 --> 00:37.699
Yeah, well, no argument there.

00:37.783 --> 00:39.701
Uh, what are we,
what are we doing here?

00:39.785 --> 00:41.369
Where are the guys?
I don't actually know.

00:41.454 --> 00:43.405
I just got a page
from Ops to meet here.

00:43.489 --> 00:44.706
What, are they hiding?

00:44.790 --> 00:47.325
Are you guys hiding, huh?

00:47.393 --> 00:49.628
You throwing me
a surprise party?

00:49.695 --> 00:51.246
You do know it's not
your birthday, right?

00:51.330 --> 00:53.215
Which is why it would
be so surprising.

00:53.299 --> 00:55.050
GRANGER (over intercom): Agent Blye,
could you come in here, please?

00:55.134 --> 00:57.269
You invited Granger?

00:57.336 --> 00:59.087
Yeah.

00:59.172 --> 01:00.922
This is the worst
surprise birthday party ever.

01:09.348 --> 01:11.850
You can go,
and you can have a seat.

01:13.486 --> 01:15.403
You good?

01:15.488 --> 01:18.240
Yeah.

01:18.324 --> 01:20.325
All right.

01:22.728 --> 01:25.563
Other side, Agent Blye.

01:25.615 --> 01:28.550
Suspects usually sit
on the other side.

01:28.618 --> 01:29.751
Yeah, they do.

01:29.835 --> 01:31.169
Sit down.

02:20.403 --> 02:21.586
Not sure, what
do you need?

02:21.637 --> 02:22.754
We need Hetty.

02:22.805 --> 02:24.056
Granger is wearing out
his welcome.

02:24.107 --> 02:25.057
You hear anything?

02:25.108 --> 02:26.058
About what?

02:26.109 --> 02:27.425
She's not answering
her phone.

02:27.477 --> 02:30.228
Okay, Granger is acting
like he's about to go medieval

02:30.279 --> 02:31.530
on Kensi in the boatshed.

02:31.597 --> 02:33.315
- He say what it's about?
- Any other names come up?

02:33.382 --> 02:35.150
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I called you guys for answers.

02:35.234 --> 02:36.151
Where is Hetty?

02:36.235 --> 02:37.652
HETTY:
Here, Mr. Deeks.

02:37.737 --> 02:40.088
All of you, upstairs now.

02:43.993 --> 02:46.078
What's Granger up to now?

02:46.129 --> 02:50.382
Like you, I can't speculate what
the assistant director is up to.

02:50.449 --> 02:53.118
Maybe this will shed some light
on the situation.

02:53.169 --> 02:54.953
Nell.

02:55.004 --> 02:57.439
Retired Master Sergeant
David Blake boarded

02:57.507 --> 03:00.308
a military flight from
Hawaii and landed at LAX

03:00.393 --> 03:02.727
at approximately 1:00
a.m. this morning.

03:02.795 --> 03:05.296
He was killed four hours
ago in a car accident.

03:05.348 --> 03:08.483
His rental car crashed
through an on-ramp barrier

03:08.568 --> 03:10.368
off the 105 freeway.

03:10.436 --> 03:11.803
So what's the connection
to Kensi?

03:11.854 --> 03:14.890
In 1997 Blake was part
of a sniper training unit.

03:14.957 --> 03:16.224
He was the spotter
for a sniper

03:16.292 --> 03:18.794
by the name
of Donald Blye.

03:18.861 --> 03:20.829
That's Kensi's father.

03:20.913 --> 03:21.863
Yes.

03:21.948 --> 03:25.283
Mr. Beale,
access the secure server.

03:25.334 --> 03:28.336
Open a file--
Ghost Recon.

03:34.694 --> 03:36.995
DEEKS: So Kensi comes
from a long line of snipers.

03:37.046 --> 03:39.231
Who else can
say that?

03:39.298 --> 03:42.100
Still doesn't explain
what Granger is up to.

03:42.168 --> 03:44.553
I'm afraid it does.

03:44.637 --> 03:47.772
The last person to be
in touch with Sergeant Blake

03:47.840 --> 03:51.443
before he died was Kensi.

03:53.896 --> 03:58.316
Explain your order of
business while in Hawaii.

03:58.367 --> 04:01.987
You have asked me that
three times.

04:02.038 --> 04:05.123
Repetitive questioning tactic
to trip up a suspect--

04:05.191 --> 04:07.175
amateur at best.

04:11.214 --> 04:14.365
Again, my father belonged

04:14.417 --> 04:17.452
to a sniper training unit
at Camp Lejeune.

04:17.519 --> 04:19.171
David Blake was his spotter
and good friend.

04:19.221 --> 04:21.039
I went to see him
because I wanted answers

04:21.089 --> 04:22.224
about my father's death.

04:22.308 --> 04:23.225
Answers?

04:23.309 --> 04:24.893
Yes, answers.

04:24.977 --> 04:28.530
Police said my father died
in a car accident.

04:28.598 --> 04:29.898
Drunk driving?

04:29.982 --> 04:31.516
My dad's brother died
because of a drunk driver.

04:31.567 --> 04:33.151
There is no way
he would have gotten

04:33.219 --> 04:35.003
behind the wheel if intoxicated.

04:38.157 --> 04:41.092
Investigation was swept
under the rug.

04:41.160 --> 04:42.727
My dad's unit was disbanded,

04:42.778 --> 04:46.114
and everybody walked away
like nothing was wrong.

04:47.116 --> 04:49.567
I was left
with nothing.

04:49.619 --> 04:51.953
Okay, go on.

04:54.040 --> 04:58.627
After I went to Hawaii...
I tracked Blake down,

04:58.711 --> 05:00.295
but he claimed
he didn't know anything.

05:00.379 --> 05:02.297
That's it.

05:05.134 --> 05:07.919
Sergeant Blake died
in a car accident this morning

05:07.970 --> 05:09.905
in Los Angeles.

05:09.972 --> 05:12.107
Now, if his
death turns out

05:12.191 --> 05:14.025
to be more than a
tragic misfortune,

05:14.093 --> 05:15.193
we're going
to have

05:15.261 --> 05:17.329
a real problem.

05:20.366 --> 05:22.284
Why's that?

05:22.368 --> 05:25.353
Because you'll be
the prime suspect in his murder.

05:30.376 --> 05:32.994
ERIC:
Donald Blye, dead, car accident.

05:33.079 --> 05:34.963
Patrick Phearson,
dead, car accident.

05:35.031 --> 05:37.332
Peter Clairmont, died in 2006

05:37.433 --> 05:38.783
working for a private contractor
in Afghanistan.

05:38.851 --> 05:40.952
Any guesses how?

05:41.003 --> 05:42.504
Survey says
"car accident"?

05:42.588 --> 05:43.955
Ding, ding, ding.

05:44.006 --> 05:48.310
Jason Klemp, Ray Duvont,
also dead, also car accidents.

05:48.377 --> 05:50.178
So either these guys are the
world's worst drivers or...

05:50.263 --> 05:51.963
Someone's taking 'em out.

05:52.014 --> 05:54.115
Three died
within the past two months.

05:54.183 --> 05:56.518
Only one alive
is Jay Fisher.

05:56.602 --> 05:57.786
NELL:
Jay Fisher is missing.

05:57.853 --> 05:58.803
No known address

05:58.854 --> 05:59.904
or number.

05:59.972 --> 06:01.022
CALLEN:
Maybe he's the one

06:01.090 --> 06:02.140
who's behind all this.

06:02.191 --> 06:03.425
Maybe he's dead
like all the rest

06:03.492 --> 06:05.377
but just hasn't been
discovered yet.

06:05.444 --> 06:08.029
Why now, after all these years?

06:08.114 --> 06:09.030
Uh, guys,

06:09.115 --> 06:11.266
the last person to contact

06:11.334 --> 06:13.868
Duvont and Klemp
before they died

06:13.953 --> 06:15.253
was Kensi.

06:15.321 --> 06:16.538
Just like Blake.

06:16.622 --> 06:18.423
(sighs)

06:18.490 --> 06:20.959
Granger thinks Kensi's involved.

06:21.010 --> 06:23.011
Give us everything you have
on the sniper training unit,

06:23.095 --> 06:26.064
starting with Kensi's father.

06:27.166 --> 06:28.967
It's all
circumstantial.

06:29.018 --> 06:30.185
ERIC: All right, Donald
Blye's unit

06:30.269 --> 06:31.436
was scheduled
to participate

06:31.503 --> 06:33.571
in an all-night
training maneuver, but

06:33.639 --> 06:36.658
Blye was incinerated
when his car ran off the road.

06:36.726 --> 06:39.160
GRANGER:
Military police could only I.D.

06:39.228 --> 06:41.196
Blye's corpse using
dental records.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.531
The official finding was,
Don Blye was killed

06:43.616 --> 06:45.850
in a drunk driving accident.

06:45.901 --> 06:48.169
Kensi refused
to accept it.

06:48.237 --> 06:49.904
What are you trying
to prove, Granger?

06:49.989 --> 06:53.658
The sniper training unit
was a cover story.

06:53.709 --> 06:55.794
The unit was actually
a black-ops team

06:55.861 --> 06:58.546
used for special missions.

06:58.631 --> 06:59.697
So w-what's
happening here?

06:59.749 --> 07:01.132
Is my partner
under arrest?

07:01.200 --> 07:06.037
Agent Blye isn't under arrest,
but she is a suspect.

07:06.088 --> 07:09.090
It appears your partner only
joined NCIS to track down

07:09.158 --> 07:12.327
those she believes
are responsible for his death.

07:12.395 --> 07:14.145
SAM:
The men in her father's unit.

07:14.213 --> 07:15.146
You're accusing
Kensi of murder?

07:15.214 --> 07:16.981
I'm saying,
check the facts.

07:17.049 --> 07:18.983
There's mounting evidence
that ties Kensi

07:19.051 --> 07:20.518
to the deaths
of those men.

07:20.569 --> 07:23.355
Kensi is a first-rate agent
with an impeccable record.

07:23.406 --> 07:24.522
I don't buy it.

07:24.573 --> 07:25.890
Well, others do.

07:25.941 --> 07:27.892
Including you.
Facts are facts,

07:27.943 --> 07:29.677
Agent Hanna.
DEEKS: You're not buying this,

07:29.745 --> 07:30.445
are you, Hetty?

07:30.529 --> 07:33.448
No, I am not, Mr. Deeks,

07:33.532 --> 07:37.735
but we will certainly
review the facts.

07:37.787 --> 07:41.539
It's all right there--
hard to disprove...

07:41.590 --> 07:43.258
but I'm sure you'll try.

07:45.594 --> 07:47.011
You've been conducting
a secret investigation

07:47.079 --> 07:49.080
the entire time
you've been here.

07:49.131 --> 07:50.415
What's your point?

07:50.466 --> 07:51.433
HETTY:
Assistant Director,

07:51.517 --> 07:53.802
a word in my office,
if you would.

07:53.886 --> 07:56.754
Of course.

07:56.806 --> 08:01.726
Gentlemen, there's
work to be done.

08:07.266 --> 08:09.534
Let's start with Blake's car.

08:09.601 --> 08:10.585
SAM:
Keep us posted.

08:10.653 --> 08:12.370
- Got it.
- Yeah.

08:14.740 --> 08:19.210
You have undermined my authority
by keeping me in the dark, Owen.

08:19.278 --> 08:23.781
If you suspected
Agent Blye of anything,

08:23.833 --> 08:26.267
you should have come
to me first.

08:26.335 --> 08:29.220
Well, I know
what a tight-knit group this is.

08:29.288 --> 08:32.474
Any other method wouldn't have
generated the same results.

08:32.558 --> 08:35.025
Ah, results?

08:35.094 --> 08:37.294
This is
an elite team,

08:37.346 --> 08:40.799
and you've just
thrown it into chaos.

08:40.866 --> 08:44.419
I won't forget this.

08:44.487 --> 08:47.155
I know.

08:50.309 --> 08:54.195
LAPD is treating it
as an accident for now,

08:54.280 --> 08:57.165
giving us a few minutes
before they get started.

08:57.249 --> 08:58.500
Why'd Blake come
to Los Angeles

08:58.584 --> 09:01.152
in the first place?

09:01.203 --> 09:02.420
Looking for Kensi?

09:02.488 --> 09:04.088
She calls him, he
hops on a flight

09:04.156 --> 09:06.508
to give her the information
she was looking for?

09:06.592 --> 09:08.593
Yeah, so pick up
the phone,

09:08.660 --> 09:10.628
e-mail, send a text.

09:10.679 --> 09:12.997
Long way to travel just to talk.

09:13.048 --> 09:14.916
That's for sure.

09:14.984 --> 09:17.001
(helicopter flying nearby)

09:20.139 --> 09:21.839
If Kensi's right and
her father was murdered,

09:21.891 --> 09:24.142
Blake could have come
over here to take her out

09:24.193 --> 09:26.528
before she found
out the truth.

09:26.612 --> 09:29.230
Somebody took Blake out first.

09:45.414 --> 09:47.749
Bad news.

09:49.802 --> 09:52.820
A small charge blew
the brake line.

09:52.888 --> 09:55.373
Wasn't an accident.

09:55.424 --> 09:58.476
Which means Kensi is now
officially a murder suspect.

09:59.457 --> 10:02.225
Only if we tell Granger.

10:16.113 --> 10:18.364
When did you last
contact Sergeant Blake?

10:18.939 --> 10:20.273
You know what?

10:20.357 --> 10:23.960
Can we just stop this stupid
dance routine and get to it?

10:24.028 --> 10:26.796
Yes, I went to see Blake
to talk about my father,

10:26.864 --> 10:28.481
but get it straight.

10:28.566 --> 10:31.818
My dad was
an honorable man,

10:31.902 --> 10:34.087
and the last thing I would do
is dishonor his memory

10:34.155 --> 10:36.089
by becoming a killer.

10:37.908 --> 10:39.826
Your father wasn't
the all-American hero

10:39.910 --> 10:41.911
you think he was.

10:44.331 --> 10:46.332
You wanted answers.

10:54.308 --> 10:57.160
What's in the file?

10:57.228 --> 11:00.780
I wish I knew, Mr. Deeks.

11:00.848 --> 11:03.666
I mean, there's go to be
something we can do here.

11:03.734 --> 11:06.469
I think you could do more
for your partner

11:06.520 --> 11:09.205
out on the streets,
doing what you do best.

11:09.273 --> 11:11.407
Don't worry.

11:11.475 --> 11:13.676
I'll take care of her.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.201
(door opens)

11:22.236 --> 11:24.254
(door closes)

11:26.373 --> 11:27.823
There has to be something
on Blake's phone.

11:27.875 --> 11:29.325
You did say you
went to MIT, right?

11:29.376 --> 11:30.793
I'm in, but there's
a series of calls

11:30.845 --> 11:32.512
I can't get a lock on
for some reason.

11:32.596 --> 11:33.763
So you're really not in.

11:33.830 --> 11:35.298
I thought you said
you could do this in your sleep.

11:35.349 --> 11:38.134
In my sleep, I don't have
people breathing down my neck.

11:38.185 --> 11:39.636
Except for that one dream.

11:39.687 --> 11:42.004
If you don't hurry up, it's
gonna turn into a nightmare.

11:42.056 --> 11:43.189
Too late.

11:43.274 --> 11:46.025
Focus, Beale, you got this.

11:46.110 --> 11:48.478
Kensi's holding her own,
but Granger's about this close

11:48.529 --> 11:49.963
to putting her
in a torture rack.

11:50.030 --> 11:51.981
- What's taking so long?
- Got it.

11:52.049 --> 11:53.650
Now wonder it was so difficult,

11:53.701 --> 11:55.952
the calls all originate
from a federal agency account.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.253
Which agency?

11:57.321 --> 11:58.905
CIA. The number's blocked,

11:58.989 --> 12:01.074
but it definitely leads
back to their network.

12:01.158 --> 12:03.359
You'd miss it if you didn't
know what to look for.

12:03.427 --> 12:04.961
NELL:
Not bad for MIT.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.862
Call CIA's Los Angeles
field office.

12:06.914 --> 12:08.748
See if they'll cooperate
and give us a name.

12:08.832 --> 12:10.216
If they don't, hack them.

12:10.301 --> 12:12.051
Looks like there are more calls
on Blake's phone

12:12.136 --> 12:14.771
to a user logged
under the single name "Fish."

12:14.838 --> 12:16.823
That could be
his unit buddy.

12:16.924 --> 12:18.091
- Jay Fisher?
- Good chance.

12:18.158 --> 12:19.609
NELL:
Looks like a burn phone,

12:19.677 --> 12:21.594
but I've got a phone number.

12:21.679 --> 12:23.879
Well, if it is Fisher, he called
David Blake this morning.

12:23.931 --> 12:25.548
Phone has since
been disconnected.

12:25.599 --> 12:27.750
Not so fast.

12:27.818 --> 12:29.068
Looks like the majority
of the calls originate

12:29.136 --> 12:31.237
from a cell tower
in Highland Park.

12:31.322 --> 12:32.855
Silver Dollar trailer park

12:32.907 --> 12:34.390
is the closest residence
in the area.

12:34.441 --> 12:37.327
Good work.

12:43.617 --> 12:45.735
(groaning)
Okay.

12:45.786 --> 12:47.120
Ouch.

12:47.204 --> 12:49.539
Did you guys ever think
about getting maybe a sedan?

12:49.590 --> 12:50.740
You know?

12:50.791 --> 12:52.742
Maybe a nice minivan?

12:52.793 --> 12:54.744
One of those
sliding doors.

12:54.795 --> 12:56.579
Ever thought about walking?

12:56.630 --> 12:58.348
You know it's only
a matter of time

12:58.415 --> 13:01.184
before LAPD and Granger
find out about Blake's car.

13:01.251 --> 13:02.585
Find out what?

13:02.636 --> 13:04.887
I didn't find anything.
You find something?

13:04.939 --> 13:07.390
You mean other than
the gaping hole in its side?

13:07.441 --> 13:08.891
What's there to find out?

13:08.943 --> 13:10.310
DEEKS:
I wasn't even there.

13:10.377 --> 13:12.562
- No?
- No.

13:12.613 --> 13:15.281
So how do you think
the CIA's involved in all this?

13:15.366 --> 13:17.367
Not a clue.

13:17.434 --> 13:20.703
I'm more concerned Fisher lured
Blake to L.A. to kill him.

13:20.771 --> 13:22.405
And is Kensi next
on his list?

13:25.275 --> 13:26.993
They all
look the same.

13:27.077 --> 13:30.246
How are we supposed to know
which one's Fisher's?

13:30.297 --> 13:32.181
That one.

13:32.249 --> 13:33.949
Other trailers
are unkempt.

13:34.001 --> 13:36.002
That one's fairly
squared away.

13:38.055 --> 13:39.622
Trenching tool.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.579
MREs.

13:46.647 --> 13:48.264
More like MR-ews.

13:48.315 --> 13:50.249
After a few weeks
living off the earth,

13:50.317 --> 13:52.468
you'd kill for one of those.

13:54.271 --> 13:56.272
(knocking)
Federal agents.

14:13.507 --> 14:15.291
It's all clear.

14:15.342 --> 14:17.293
(phone line ringing)
No sign of struggle.

14:17.344 --> 14:18.711
ERIC: Yo.
- Eric,

14:18.796 --> 14:20.496
we're at the Silver Dollar
trailer park in Highland Park.

14:20.547 --> 14:22.598
Check and see if there's
any security camera footage

14:22.666 --> 14:23.966
of the last 24 hours.

14:24.018 --> 14:26.736
Silver Dollar. Got it.

14:26.804 --> 14:28.071
I found something.

14:28.138 --> 14:29.455
What, are you one
of the Hardy Boys?

14:29.523 --> 14:31.674
More like Nancy Drew.

14:31.725 --> 14:34.727
You can laugh it up, boys,
but check that out.

14:34.812 --> 14:36.813
He's got a date.

14:36.864 --> 14:38.915
What do you think that is?

14:38.982 --> 14:41.000
Alexander, shelter, 5:30.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.288
Could be anywhere.

14:45.355 --> 14:47.707
(phone rings)
What do you got, Eric?

14:47.791 --> 14:49.208
Security footage
from the trailer park

14:49.293 --> 14:52.862
shows a ton of people coming in
and out over the last 24 hours.

14:52.913 --> 14:54.964
It could take days
to go through all of this.

14:55.031 --> 14:56.315
There is one

14:56.383 --> 14:59.602
familiar face that stands out.

14:59.670 --> 15:02.588
Kensi Blye.

15:04.875 --> 15:07.376
What about marine sniper school?

15:07.428 --> 15:09.395
It was a cover story.

15:09.480 --> 15:13.933
Your father was a member
of an elite black-ops unit

15:14.017 --> 15:18.071
specializing
in irregular rendition.

15:18.155 --> 15:22.959
Let me guess, his, uh,
constant trips for work

15:23.026 --> 15:25.111
wasn't to train
American allies, then?

15:25.195 --> 15:26.779
No.

15:26.864 --> 15:30.283
It was for eliminating threats
to American national security.

15:30.367 --> 15:32.735
So what you're saying is
my father was an assassin?

15:32.786 --> 15:34.403
Oh, of course not.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.756
The United States
doesn't sanction

15:36.840 --> 15:40.209
political assassination.

15:40.260 --> 15:41.511
You wanted
to know the truth.

15:41.578 --> 15:43.930
What, that my father never truly
revealed himself to me?

15:43.997 --> 15:45.631
Thank you very much for that.

15:45.716 --> 15:48.301
GRANGER:
Must run in the family.

15:48.368 --> 15:50.470
Am I free to go now?

15:50.554 --> 15:52.087
Report on Blake's car
isn't in yet,

15:52.139 --> 15:54.256
so you can come and go
as you please.

16:02.366 --> 16:03.449
You knew?

16:03.517 --> 16:05.952
No, I did not.

16:16.964 --> 16:18.748
So, I assume the purpose

16:18.799 --> 16:21.567
of that ludicrous exhibition
was to--

16:21.635 --> 16:25.138
what-- examine her reaction?

16:26.890 --> 16:29.291
She's a seasoned
undercover agent.

16:29.343 --> 16:31.344
You heard her,
she has motive.

16:31.428 --> 16:33.763
If this were anyone else,
it wouldn't be an issue.

16:33.814 --> 16:37.016
You are wrong on this, Owen.

16:37.100 --> 16:38.584
Let me explain
something to you.

16:38.652 --> 16:42.939
If it turns out that Blye's
responsible for these murders,

16:42.990 --> 16:45.358
Director Vance has no option

16:45.442 --> 16:47.827
but to consider
your team compromised

16:47.911 --> 16:49.896
and disbanded.

17:09.468 --> 17:11.469
(knocking)

17:15.641 --> 17:17.642
(knocking resumes)

17:38.664 --> 17:40.749
You know the convenience store
around the corner really sucks.

17:40.833 --> 17:43.067
All they had was stale coffee
and fuzzy doughnuts.

17:43.119 --> 17:45.253
Deeks, it's not a good time.

17:46.756 --> 17:49.641
It would be kind of a pity to
waste a mediocre cup of coffee.

17:49.709 --> 17:53.428
Here, just hold it,
and then I'll...

17:53.513 --> 17:54.880
Deeks... (gasps)

17:54.931 --> 17:57.081
Oh, sorry
about that.

17:57.133 --> 17:59.634
God, I can't believe
you just fell for that.

17:59.719 --> 18:02.253
Just, uh, so you know,

18:02.305 --> 18:05.874
you've got two undercover agents
outside watching you.

18:05.942 --> 18:07.192
Yes, I know.

18:07.259 --> 18:09.761
And just to clarify,
when did you

18:09.812 --> 18:12.096
start moonlighting
as a hit man?

18:12.148 --> 18:14.900
I mean, you got the whole
federal agent by day

18:14.951 --> 18:16.985
and killer by night.

18:17.069 --> 18:18.820
I mean, it really
does have summer blockbuster

18:18.905 --> 18:20.104
written all over it.

18:20.156 --> 18:23.658
Well, if it were true, guess
who my next victim would be?

18:23.743 --> 18:25.777
Wow.

18:25.828 --> 18:27.829
No, no, no!

18:35.304 --> 18:37.455
It was my dad's.

18:37.507 --> 18:39.224
That doesn't explain
what you're doing with it.

18:39.291 --> 18:41.676
I was cleaning it.

18:41.761 --> 18:43.762
Why?

18:49.685 --> 18:51.820
What have you guys got so far?

18:51.904 --> 18:53.939
Subject change.

18:53.990 --> 18:56.140
I'll play along.

18:56.192 --> 18:58.710
David Blake's car
was tampered with.

18:58.778 --> 19:01.496
His brake lines were rigged
with a small explosive.

19:01.581 --> 19:03.248
Looks like
he was murdered.

19:03.315 --> 19:04.316
You don't think it was...

19:04.383 --> 19:06.167
Not for a second.

19:08.604 --> 19:10.488
Why hasn't Granger

19:10.540 --> 19:11.723
arrested me?

19:11.791 --> 19:14.993
'Cause we haven't told him yet.

19:15.044 --> 19:18.630
Thought we could buy ourselves
a little bit of time,

19:18.681 --> 19:21.683
but Forensics is eventually
gonna find it.

19:28.307 --> 19:30.408
I realize that

19:30.476 --> 19:33.278
this is the point
in the conversation

19:33.345 --> 19:36.031
when I say something profound
and life-affirming,

19:36.115 --> 19:37.549
so I actually...

19:37.617 --> 19:39.367
came prepared.

19:39.452 --> 19:40.585
(clears throat)

19:40.653 --> 19:43.755
Everything is gonna be fine.

19:46.459 --> 19:48.310
That's...

19:48.377 --> 19:50.361
That's it?

19:50.413 --> 19:52.363
Seemed longer
when I was writing it.

19:52.415 --> 19:54.716
Probably sounds better,
like, in Latin.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.201
It's more profound if I say it...
(laughs)

19:57.253 --> 20:00.672
But you're laughing,
so it obviously worked.

20:00.723 --> 20:01.823
Yeah.

20:01.891 --> 20:03.374
Hmm.

20:10.066 --> 20:13.602
There's a lot about what's going
on that I haven't told you.

20:13.669 --> 20:16.054
But I'm your partner;
you can tell me anything.

20:16.122 --> 20:19.223
I haven't told you
to protect you.

20:19.275 --> 20:20.775
Because there are...

20:20.860 --> 20:21.960
(phone ringing)

20:23.696 --> 20:25.580
Are you gonna get that?

20:25.665 --> 20:27.899
Wasn't planning on it.

20:27.950 --> 20:30.251
(ringing continues)

20:33.089 --> 20:35.790
Just two seconds.

20:35.875 --> 20:37.342
It's Deeks.

20:37.409 --> 20:41.029
HETTY: Mr. Deeks, I need you
to take Kensi into custody.

20:41.097 --> 20:42.964
I'm sorry, it's protocol.

20:43.049 --> 20:44.316
Yeah, no, copy that.

20:44.383 --> 20:46.751
Sooner rather than later.
Yeah.

20:46.802 --> 20:48.553
Yeah, no, I got it.

20:48.604 --> 20:51.022
All right.
Okay.

20:51.090 --> 20:52.941
Uh...

20:53.025 --> 20:54.109
What?

20:54.193 --> 20:55.460
That was Hetty.

20:55.528 --> 20:59.097
LAPD discovered
that Blake's car was rigged.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.534
I go to bring you in.

21:10.376 --> 21:13.828
So, the CIA,
surprisingly cooperative.

21:13.913 --> 21:15.964
NELL:
Once Hetty made a call.

21:16.048 --> 21:18.950
Uh, the other number Blake
called this morning

21:19.001 --> 21:21.970
was to a CIA employee
named Alex Harris.

21:22.054 --> 21:24.973
Deeks found the name Alex
at Fisher's trailer.

21:25.057 --> 21:26.975
Harris currently has a position
as a foreign policy analyst,

21:27.059 --> 21:30.145
but back in the '90s, he was
the handler for Donald Blye's

21:30.146 --> 21:31.443
black-ops unit.

21:31.468 --> 21:33.394
CALLEN: Why didn't Granger
mention Harris earlier?

21:33.599 --> 21:34.866
Where's Alex Harris now?

21:34.934 --> 21:37.435
That's where CIA
cooperation ended.

21:37.486 --> 21:39.404
Once they suspected Harris
was mixed up in something,

21:39.471 --> 21:40.805
they shut us down.

21:40.856 --> 21:43.307
Harris might be taking out
members of his own team.

21:43.359 --> 21:45.176
They might have had
something on him.

21:45.244 --> 21:47.078
And Kensi snooping around
set him in motion.

21:47.146 --> 21:49.164
GRANGER:
Thank you, Detective Deeks.

21:49.248 --> 21:50.765
DEEKS: I didn't do this
for you, Granger.

21:50.833 --> 21:52.483
GRANGER:
Bad news, Agent Blye.

21:52.535 --> 21:56.454
Forensics team figured out
David Blake's car was sabotaged.

21:56.505 --> 22:00.058
It's funny how
two trained agents

22:00.126 --> 22:02.160
and an LAPD detective
missed that.

22:02.211 --> 22:03.712
Well, we're only human.

22:03.796 --> 22:06.281
Orders from D.C. I have
to take you into custody.

22:06.348 --> 22:07.716
I'm not going anywhere.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.684
You're going
to a secure location

22:09.769 --> 22:13.504
where you will not have access
to NCIS intel or personnel.

22:13.556 --> 22:15.056
You're the
assistant director.

22:15.141 --> 22:17.792
You're telling me you can't hold
off on this until we solve it?

22:17.860 --> 22:20.228
There's this thing
called protocol.

22:20.312 --> 22:23.148
You all seem to have
forgotten what it is.

22:23.199 --> 22:24.482
Think of it as
protective custody.

22:24.533 --> 22:26.017
Are we really gonna
let this happen?

22:26.068 --> 22:27.535
I mean, think about
what you're saying.

22:27.620 --> 22:28.703
This doesn't
make any sense.

22:28.788 --> 22:29.954
Why would I kill Blake?

22:30.022 --> 22:32.157
I need a moment with Ms. Blye.

22:32.208 --> 22:34.743
Of course.

22:38.714 --> 22:41.082
Excuse me, sir.

22:41.167 --> 22:44.368
The director would like to know
if you intend to bring charges.

22:44.420 --> 22:45.703
Tell the director

22:45.755 --> 22:48.539
that is a distinct
possibility, Agent Clookie.

22:48.591 --> 22:49.707
Yes, sir.

22:49.759 --> 22:51.760
Thank you.

22:54.313 --> 22:57.065
We seem to find ourselves
in a bit of a pinch.

22:57.149 --> 23:00.935
But I want you to know
that you are not alone.

23:01.020 --> 23:02.954
Hetty, I didn't do this.

23:03.022 --> 23:05.006
I know, Kensi.

23:05.074 --> 23:06.991
We'll do all we can.

23:07.059 --> 23:08.693
GRANGER:
Agent Blye?

23:08.744 --> 23:10.394
We have to go.

23:10.446 --> 23:12.447
HETTY:
Go.

23:18.788 --> 23:20.789
DEEKS: He's actually
going through with this.

23:23.042 --> 23:24.259
What is it, Eric?

23:24.343 --> 23:26.928
Uh, Fisher's burn phone
went back online.

23:27.012 --> 23:29.413
I tracked him to the old
theater district downtown.

23:29.465 --> 23:31.349
It's a good place
to hide out.

23:31.416 --> 23:33.417
Keep feeding us
coordinates.

23:42.194 --> 23:45.096
(computer trilling)

23:45.164 --> 23:47.782
Looks like Kensi's
been requesting files

23:47.867 --> 23:49.667
related to her father's
death for years.

23:49.735 --> 23:53.204
Well, according to this,
all the files Kensi requested

23:53.272 --> 23:55.557
were routed through
the same desk at the DOD.

23:55.624 --> 23:58.893
Granger's.

23:58.961 --> 24:01.963
If Granger's known for years
that Kensi's been digging

24:02.047 --> 24:04.966
into the mystery
of her father's death,

24:05.050 --> 24:07.802
they why wouldn't
he tell us?

24:07.887 --> 24:09.988
I am not liking
the sound of this.

24:16.979 --> 24:18.479
ERIC: According
to his last transmission,

24:18.564 --> 24:20.565
you guys should be
right on top of him.

24:20.632 --> 24:22.700
Fisher's GPS went out,
but he's somewhere inside

24:22.768 --> 24:24.468
the old Los Angeles theater.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.204
CALLEN:
Got it, Eric.

24:26.272 --> 24:28.356
(whispering):
He's in the building.

24:28.424 --> 24:31.442
You cover left,
cover right, I'll go up.

24:44.173 --> 24:46.374
Clear.

24:47.376 --> 24:49.143
Clear.

24:54.550 --> 24:58.219
(grunting)

25:00.806 --> 25:02.807
(grunting continues)

25:06.445 --> 25:08.112
G?
It's Fisher.

25:08.180 --> 25:10.398
Go.

25:13.319 --> 25:15.236
(engine revving)

25:22.995 --> 25:25.246
(people screaming and gasping)

25:30.653 --> 25:32.637
DEEKS: That is not a good way
to go out.

25:45.545 --> 25:47.880
(indistinct radio transmission)

25:48.015 --> 25:50.573
Hey. You think Fisher's death
will convince Granger

25:50.574 --> 25:52.159
of Kensi's innocence?

25:52.163 --> 25:53.914
(sighs) I mean,
Kensi's in custody, right?

25:53.965 --> 25:56.666
She couldn't possibly have
remote-detonated that bomb.

25:56.751 --> 25:58.335
Deeks, there's a half
a dozen different ways

25:58.419 --> 25:59.636
that bomb could have detonated.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.388
None of which would require
Kensi to be there

26:01.455 --> 26:02.973
to trigger the device.

26:03.057 --> 26:04.791
I know.

26:04.842 --> 26:07.010
I just thought we could
slide one over on Granger.

26:07.095 --> 26:08.528
Don't worry, Deeks.

26:08.596 --> 26:10.130
We're gonna get
her out of this.

26:10.198 --> 26:12.682
Maybe we can pull
something off of this.

26:12.767 --> 26:15.018
Fisher must have dropped it
when you guys were brawling.

26:17.355 --> 26:19.973
I know that look.

26:20.024 --> 26:22.242
The job is done.

26:22.309 --> 26:26.746
Fisher was the last living
member of Donald Blye's unit.

26:26.814 --> 26:30.884
If I was Alex Harris,
I'd be on a flight right now.

26:30.952 --> 26:33.870
Then, we're going to need
a miracle to find him.

26:44.182 --> 26:46.049
(line ringing)

26:46.134 --> 26:47.300
ERIC:
Hello.

26:47.351 --> 26:48.668
Eric,

26:48.719 --> 26:50.103
I'm calling you
from Fisher's phone.

26:50.171 --> 26:52.005
See if he contacted Alex Harris
from it.

26:52.056 --> 26:54.341
We may be able
to locate him if he did.

26:54.408 --> 26:55.809
(computer trilling)

26:55.877 --> 26:57.677
ERIC: There are several
repeating numbers.

26:57.728 --> 26:59.896
One of them traces back
to David Blake,

26:59.981 --> 27:03.033
and another one is...
untraceable.

27:03.117 --> 27:04.350
Probably Harris.

27:04.402 --> 27:05.518
Nothing's untraceable.

27:05.570 --> 27:07.137
We just have to get creative.

27:07.205 --> 27:08.371
Maybe we're overthinking this.

27:08.456 --> 27:10.473
Why not just call Harris
from Fisher's phone?

27:10.541 --> 27:13.193
If Harris killed Fisher, why
would he answer Fisher's call?

27:13.244 --> 27:14.694
Curiosity.

27:14.745 --> 27:17.697
If Harris didn't kill Fisher,
he'd probably answer.

27:17.748 --> 27:20.383
But that would mean Kensi...

27:21.419 --> 27:23.753
Maybe we get lucky.

27:23.838 --> 27:25.889
Right?

27:25.973 --> 27:27.757
Look, if Harris answers, we can

27:27.842 --> 27:29.109
lock in and track him.

27:29.177 --> 27:31.094
CALLEN:
Make the call, Eric.

27:31.179 --> 27:33.379
(touch-tones sounding)

27:33.431 --> 27:36.032
(phone line ringing)

27:40.605 --> 27:41.771
(phone line ringing)

27:41.856 --> 27:43.273
(dial tone drones)

27:43.357 --> 27:45.058
What now?

27:45.109 --> 27:47.160
CALLEN:
We keep looking.

27:59.006 --> 28:00.790
Tuna or turkey?

28:00.875 --> 28:02.209
I'm not hungry.

28:02.260 --> 28:04.077
Agent Carter, right?

28:04.128 --> 28:05.962
Yeah.
I need you to make

28:06.047 --> 28:07.080
an important call for me.

28:07.131 --> 28:08.481
It's not going
to happen.

28:08.549 --> 28:10.917
I have to get some information
to my team

28:10.968 --> 28:12.602
that could help them
solve this case.

28:12.687 --> 28:14.921
It's against protocol.

28:14.972 --> 28:16.806
What if she's telling the truth?

28:16.874 --> 28:18.158
CARTER:
What if she isn't?

28:18.226 --> 28:19.709
Granger would kill us.

28:19.777 --> 28:21.144
People are dying.

28:21.229 --> 28:23.429
If there is a chance
that we could save a life,

28:23.481 --> 28:25.365
then you have to make
this call for me.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.535
Please.

28:30.488 --> 28:32.438
Sorry, Agent Blye.

28:32.490 --> 28:34.491
It's against
protocol.

28:38.713 --> 28:40.280
CALLEN:
So what now?

28:40.331 --> 28:42.215
SAM: We know Fisher was meeting
Harris, but where?

28:42.283 --> 28:44.084
Well, Eric and Nell
couldn't find much on Fisher.

28:44.135 --> 28:45.218
DEEKS:
Yeah, but Kensi did.

28:45.286 --> 28:47.287
She was able to track Fisher
to the trailer park.

28:47.338 --> 28:48.421
Maybe she has
more information.

28:48.472 --> 28:50.056
CALLEN:
Kind of hard to ask her.

28:50.124 --> 28:51.374
Granger's got
her holed up.

28:51.442 --> 28:53.093
Well, maybe the info's
on her computer.

28:53.144 --> 28:55.345
I doubt she would keep
that sort of thing at work.

28:55.429 --> 28:57.514
Maybe it's her home computer.

28:59.650 --> 29:00.967
Shotgun!

29:01.018 --> 29:02.686
DEEKS:
Called it.

29:02.770 --> 29:05.438
I called it-- shotgun!

29:09.310 --> 29:11.361
(groans)

29:11.445 --> 29:13.446
Seriously?

29:14.699 --> 29:16.700
Get in.

29:20.588 --> 29:22.038
CALLEN:
Just your basic stuff.

29:22.123 --> 29:25.108
Bills, magazines, gossip sites.

29:25.176 --> 29:27.010
Could be a protected file.

29:31.465 --> 29:32.882
Ah. Hidden directory.

29:32.967 --> 29:34.384
Well, it's password-protected.

29:34.468 --> 29:36.703
Try "king of the world,"
all caps, no spaces.

29:38.139 --> 29:40.890
<i>Titanic's</i> her favorite movie.

29:42.977 --> 29:45.362
What? I'm a detective.
I detect.

29:45.446 --> 29:47.230
SAM: Yeah? You'll detect
a black eye

29:47.298 --> 29:49.049
if you've been
on my computer.

29:49.116 --> 29:51.017
(electronic chiming)
We're in.

29:51.068 --> 29:52.786
Yeah.

29:52.853 --> 29:54.904
Fisher-- there.

29:56.490 --> 29:57.690
CALLEN:
Okay.

29:57.742 --> 30:00.810
It looks like Fisher
was a paranoid survivalist.

30:00.878 --> 30:02.662
Moved around a lot.

30:02.713 --> 30:06.333
Stockpiled a lot of gear
and different supplies.

30:06.384 --> 30:08.385
Sounds familiar.

30:12.056 --> 30:15.408
All right, she had surveillance
on the trailer park.

30:15.476 --> 30:17.277
The theater downtown.

30:17.345 --> 30:19.379
Civil defense shelter

30:19.447 --> 30:20.647
in Highland Park.

30:20.714 --> 30:22.048
Civil defense shelter?

30:22.099 --> 30:23.783
Hold on a second.

30:23.851 --> 30:26.386
The note is:
"Alexander, shelter, 5:30."

30:26.437 --> 30:28.605
Could be where Fisher
was meeting Harris.

30:28.689 --> 30:30.106
Worth checking out.

30:30.191 --> 30:32.275
Let's do it.

30:38.833 --> 30:41.084
DEEKS:
Bomb shelter?

30:41.168 --> 30:44.037
Doesn't look like it
would stop a sake bomb.

30:44.088 --> 30:46.039
SAM: Must be fortified
inside.

30:46.090 --> 30:48.408
Kensi's no fool.

30:48.459 --> 30:51.511
She was obviously casing
this place for a reason.

30:51.578 --> 30:53.579
Hey.

30:56.884 --> 30:58.101
DEEKS:
All right, what kind

30:58.185 --> 31:00.720
of paranoid nutcase
has a bomb shelter?

31:00.805 --> 31:02.756
- I have one.
- What?

31:02.823 --> 31:04.991
Yeah. Me and my family can
stay there for months.

31:05.059 --> 31:06.926
I didn't... I didn't mean you.
I thought maybe...

31:06.977 --> 31:08.261
I have one, too.

31:08.312 --> 31:09.896
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just
because you squat there

31:09.947 --> 31:11.548
from time to time
doesn't make it yours.

31:11.615 --> 31:12.982
Hey, it's me and you
against him.

31:13.100 --> 31:14.434
That's how it works.

31:14.485 --> 31:16.569
Sorry. Habit.

31:16.620 --> 31:18.371
I have one.

31:20.074 --> 31:22.075
Hey, listen, uh, can
you guys do me a favor?

31:22.126 --> 31:23.743
Maybe not scream out
"federal agents" this time?

31:23.794 --> 31:26.129
'Cause that's usually when
they tend to start shooting.

31:40.344 --> 31:42.145
SAM (whispering):
Look at the dust.

31:50.438 --> 31:51.438
DEEKS (whispering):
Same here.

32:05.035 --> 32:06.119
(gunfire)

32:06.170 --> 32:08.288
Federal agents!
(gunfire stops)

32:08.339 --> 32:09.489
MAN:
Prove it!

32:09.540 --> 32:11.341
Toss out your badge!

32:11.425 --> 32:14.827
Well, that has got to be the
first time that's ever worked.

32:14.879 --> 32:16.996
MAN:
Carefully!

32:28.726 --> 32:29.842
I'm coming out!

32:29.894 --> 32:31.294
Let me see
your hands!

32:31.362 --> 32:34.280
Let me see
your hands!

32:38.852 --> 32:40.752
Alex Harris, CIA.

32:41.152 --> 32:45.205
You need to get me
into protective custody now.

32:45.272 --> 32:47.624
Walk towards me.

32:48.659 --> 32:50.494
Hands on the wall.

32:55.833 --> 32:57.834
Are you really not going
to call my team?

32:57.902 --> 32:59.786
Sorry, Agent Blye,

32:59.837 --> 33:00.754
I can't break
protocol.

33:00.838 --> 33:02.272
Then, I'm sorry, too.

33:03.391 --> 33:05.809
(grunting)
(gasps)

33:12.767 --> 33:14.851
Should have followed
your instincts.

33:19.991 --> 33:23.493
CALLEN:
Jay Fisher was killed today.

33:23.578 --> 33:25.529
SAM:
We think it was you.

33:33.604 --> 33:35.772
Gentlemen, I'm sure you're good
at what you do,

33:35.840 --> 33:38.892
but no way in hell I go
on record with three cameras,

33:38.960 --> 33:40.794
a parabolic mic,

33:40.845 --> 33:45.365
and probably a class-five
fiber-optic scope pointed at me.

33:45.433 --> 33:49.853
Someone's out there whacking
members of your old team.

33:49.937 --> 33:52.689
We could release you and let you
talk to them if you'd prefer.

33:53.724 --> 33:55.725
You could,

33:55.793 --> 33:58.562
but then Blye's daughter
never finds out the truth.

34:00.148 --> 34:04.184
I'll talk,
just not on record.

34:06.754 --> 34:08.737
SAM:
Okay.

34:10.741 --> 34:13.226
What is it that you want?

34:13.293 --> 34:14.543
Protection.

34:14.629 --> 34:16.530
In exchange for?

34:16.597 --> 34:19.299
I'll tell you
everything I know

34:19.366 --> 34:22.819
but only to Blye's daughter
at a location of my choice.

34:22.887 --> 34:24.971
What's in it for you?

34:26.607 --> 34:28.975
Redemption.

34:30.511 --> 34:33.612
Why do you care so much
about Kensi Blye?

34:33.681 --> 34:37.400
She deserves to know
the truth about her father.

34:45.775 --> 34:48.661
Well, pick up
or delivery?

34:48.728 --> 34:49.862
Kensi, that is,
not lunch.

34:49.914 --> 34:50.996
I'm gonna go get her.

34:51.065 --> 34:52.114
No, you won't.

34:52.183 --> 34:54.167
You're gonna have
to bring her in.

34:54.235 --> 34:55.585
Harris isn't going
to talk without her.

34:55.670 --> 34:56.585
I will not let

34:56.704 --> 34:58.038
a suspect dictate
the direction

34:58.089 --> 34:59.789
of this investigation.

34:59.874 --> 35:02.259
For all we know, he could be
trying to kill Agent Blye.

35:02.343 --> 35:05.028
Oh, I thought you believed
Kensi was trying to kill him.

35:05.096 --> 35:09.199
We know about you giving Kensi
access to her father's files.

35:09.267 --> 35:11.218
We're not gonna hesitate
to reveal your involvement

35:11.269 --> 35:14.037
in the matter to anyone
in the chain of command.

35:14.105 --> 35:16.072
That's right
up to SECNAV.

35:16.140 --> 35:19.359
I don't know what the game
is that you're playing,

35:19.426 --> 35:21.094
but you're gonna lose.

35:21.162 --> 35:23.380
Is that a veiled threat,
Agent Hanna?

35:23.447 --> 35:25.615
I don't do veiled.

35:27.785 --> 35:30.320
Fine,
we'll bring her in.

35:34.125 --> 35:35.909
(line ringing)

35:35.960 --> 35:37.794
Yeah, it's Granger.

35:37.878 --> 35:40.547
CARTER (over phone): Assistant Director,
Agent Blye has escaped.

35:40.614 --> 35:41.881
How?

35:41.949 --> 35:43.950
She... she got the jump
on us, sir.

35:45.803 --> 35:47.170
Agent Blye has escaped.

35:47.255 --> 35:48.171
What happened,

35:48.256 --> 35:49.839
and I want specifics.

35:49.924 --> 35:52.809
(Granger continues indistinctly)

36:08.056 --> 36:10.858
(sighs)

36:11.741 --> 36:13.542
Sorry.

36:13.610 --> 36:14.749
They wouldn't let me call
you guys, and I didn't...

36:14.750 --> 36:16.302
No, no, no, no, no.
We don't have time for that.

36:17.414 --> 36:20.132
There's a lot
of damning evidence here.

36:21.401 --> 36:24.303
I've seen careers

36:24.387 --> 36:28.790
more mature than yours
ruined over less,

36:28.842 --> 36:31.977
but they weren't nearly
as strong as you are.

36:34.981 --> 36:37.966
Why you came to NCIS

36:38.018 --> 36:40.019
isn't important.

36:41.071 --> 36:42.638
It's what you do
moving forward

36:42.706 --> 36:45.357
from here.

36:45.408 --> 36:48.777
You're not who your past
says you are.

36:48.828 --> 36:52.331
You're who you choose to be.

36:56.453 --> 37:00.989
Callen, Sam, and Deeks have
tracked down Alex Harris.

37:01.041 --> 37:03.592
He was the handler for your
father's black-ops team.

37:03.660 --> 37:05.210
Well, then,
I want to talk to him.

37:05.295 --> 37:06.495
Good.

37:06.563 --> 37:09.281
He wants to speak
with you, but only you.

37:09.349 --> 37:11.216
We don't want
to test Harris.

37:11.301 --> 37:12.718
He's too savvy.

37:12.802 --> 37:16.388
That means no wires,
no comms.

37:16.473 --> 37:19.208
We'll be blind.

37:20.777 --> 37:22.611
You don't have
to do this, Kensi.

37:22.679 --> 37:24.846
Oh, but I do.

37:24.898 --> 37:27.499
If I don't, I may
never find the truth.

37:29.119 --> 37:30.852
You'll need this.

37:30.904 --> 37:32.087
A girl has
to take steps

37:32.155 --> 37:33.956
to protect herself.

37:42.716 --> 37:44.466
Thank you.

37:45.502 --> 37:49.154
Please be careful.

37:49.222 --> 37:51.807
I will.

37:59.983 --> 38:01.567
Do we have satellite access?

38:01.651 --> 38:03.719
I won't have picture
for another 45 minutes,

38:03.770 --> 38:05.738
but I found something else.

38:05.822 --> 38:07.773
Granger has an e-trail
as long as Hetty's,

38:07.857 --> 38:10.492
and it all looks by-the-numbers
until I cross-referenced

38:10.560 --> 38:13.579
Granger's file
with the Donald Blye case.

38:13.663 --> 38:16.799
Granger and Harris were
in the same division at the CIA.

38:17.834 --> 38:19.418
Soon as we prove
Kensi's innocence,

38:19.502 --> 38:20.919
we're going after Granger.

38:21.004 --> 38:22.221
CALLEN:
Deal.

38:34.217 --> 38:35.801
Just to clarify,

38:35.885 --> 38:40.389
if anything happens to Kensi,
you're gonna be dealing with me

38:40.440 --> 38:42.608
for the rest of your
soon-to-be-very-short life.

38:42.692 --> 38:45.444
Your boss know about you two?

38:47.030 --> 38:48.664
You're either
lying to yourself,

38:48.732 --> 38:50.032
or you're hiding from it.

38:50.099 --> 38:52.685
Either way, son,
makes the job harder.

39:08.718 --> 39:11.420
I hope Kensi's got
her head in the game.

39:11.471 --> 39:13.639
She's been in worse jams.

39:13.723 --> 39:17.176
Physically, yes, but
not after learning

39:17.260 --> 39:19.812
that mostly everything she knew
about her father was wrong.

39:21.848 --> 39:25.467
Nothing is worse
than not knowing.

39:25.518 --> 39:27.536
Talking about Kensi or you?

39:31.658 --> 39:33.609
What if the
answers you find

39:33.660 --> 39:35.527
aren't the ones
you're looking for?

39:35.612 --> 39:38.447
You know the motto
that's engraved

39:38.498 --> 39:40.816
at CIA headquarters in Langley?

39:40.867 --> 39:42.251
John 8:32.

39:42.318 --> 39:44.503
"Ye shall know the truth, and
the truth shall make you free."

39:44.621 --> 39:46.622
Amen.

40:14.400 --> 40:16.702
KENSI:
What are you doing?

40:16.786 --> 40:18.019
Is there a problem?

40:18.071 --> 40:19.488
I'm just making sure

40:19.539 --> 40:21.123
we're not being watched
or followed.

40:25.245 --> 40:26.912
I don't like it.

40:26.996 --> 40:29.381
We don't have
ears or eyes.

40:29.466 --> 40:32.033
No, couldn't
take the chance.

40:32.085 --> 40:34.319
Kensi can handle herself.

40:34.387 --> 40:35.420
I know.

40:35.505 --> 40:37.256
Doesn't mean I
have to like it.

40:42.929 --> 40:44.279
(sighs)

40:44.347 --> 40:46.899
Do we have eyes,
Mr. Beale?

40:46.983 --> 40:48.984
We still need
six to eight minutes.

40:54.357 --> 40:56.658
Let me be clear.

40:56.726 --> 40:58.627
I will not hesitate
to kill you.

40:58.695 --> 41:01.730
I expect nothing less.

41:01.781 --> 41:03.782
It's in your blood.

41:05.785 --> 41:07.519
Why'd you kill
Blake and Fisher?

41:07.587 --> 41:09.538
I didn't.

41:09.589 --> 41:11.874
Blake came to L.A.
to meet with Fisher and me

41:11.925 --> 41:14.409
so we could try and figure out
a way to stay alive.

41:14.460 --> 41:16.345
From who?

41:16.412 --> 41:18.413
You, we thought
at first.

41:21.851 --> 41:24.153
I know what happened
to your father.

41:26.556 --> 41:28.590
He didn't die in
a car accident,

41:28.641 --> 41:29.825
he was murdered.

41:29.893 --> 41:32.778
His death was staged to
look like an accident.

41:32.862 --> 41:34.563
The man that's
killing off the team

41:34.614 --> 41:36.431
is the same man that
killed your father.

41:36.482 --> 41:38.450
Okay, who is he?

41:38.535 --> 41:40.485
What's his name?

41:40.570 --> 41:42.821
After he takes me out,
he's coming for you.

41:42.906 --> 41:44.122
What is his name?!

41:44.207 --> 41:45.591
(gunshot)

41:47.360 --> 41:48.493
(gunshot)

41:48.578 --> 41:49.494
Kensi!

41:50.547 --> 41:52.414
(gunshot)
