WEBVTT

00:00.062 --> 00:02.710
- Previously on The Originals...
- I don't go free until we make

00:02.713 --> 00:04.825
a weapon that can kill Marcel.

00:04.827 --> 00:06.460
And since I am on the most-wanted list

00:06.462 --> 00:08.195
of every psycho who
wants your family dead,

00:08.197 --> 00:11.832
I guess I'm Team Mikaelson,
whether I like it or not.

00:11.834 --> 00:14.070
You freed it, Vincent.
You gave it breath.

00:14.073 --> 00:15.706
And now it must be fed.

00:16.906 --> 00:19.139
- I had a bad dream.
- You're safe.

00:19.141 --> 00:21.334
I saw something today,
and it's something that

00:21.337 --> 00:23.377
I've seen before. This city is in danger.

00:23.379 --> 00:26.046
It means the Hollow.
The Hollow is coming.

00:26.048 --> 00:28.949
The Hollow wants power.

00:28.951 --> 00:31.452
The kind that only comes from sacrifice.

00:31.454 --> 00:34.788
This thing is dark, it's angry,
it's very powerful.

00:34.790 --> 00:36.891
Everything that you want to
keep buried... it's going to

00:36.893 --> 00:39.827
use that and make you do
exactly what it wants you to do.

00:39.829 --> 00:40.789
They wanted us here.

00:40.792 --> 00:42.229
They want to channel your power

00:42.231 --> 00:44.498
and anchor the Hollow
to the living world.

00:44.500 --> 00:47.134
It will feed...

00:47.136 --> 00:49.703
and it will rise.

00:50.873 --> 00:52.873
It's here.

00:52.875 --> 00:54.908
The Hollow.

00:56.646 --> 00:58.512
It's here.

Please.

02:18.627 --> 02:19.626
Please!

02:19.628 --> 02:21.261
Help me. Please.

02:22.665 --> 02:23.897
Please. No.

02:23.899 --> 02:25.499
No!

02:27.323 --> 02:29.523
No! Please!

02:30.793 --> 02:33.894
You would show mercy to an enemy?!

02:33.896 --> 02:35.396
A fiend

02:35.398 --> 02:37.431
who plotted to raid our home?

02:40.269 --> 02:43.437
Mercy... is for the weak,

02:43.439 --> 02:45.139
Niklaus.

02:46.042 --> 02:47.408
You...

02:49.379 --> 02:51.779
Look at you, boy.

02:51.781 --> 02:53.314
You are pathetic.

02:53.316 --> 02:55.049
If you are determined

02:55.051 --> 02:59.387
to prove yourself a weakling,
I should cast you out!

02:59.389 --> 03:01.722
Better your brothers not
be exposed to a coward!

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

04:01.984 --> 04:05.286
You didn't come back to
your place last night.

04:05.288 --> 04:07.021
What's going on?

04:08.791 --> 04:11.559
I just spent the last six hours
going to every palm reader,

04:11.561 --> 04:13.349
exorcist and witch doctor I know.

04:13.352 --> 04:14.851
Now, they all say I'm fine,

04:14.854 --> 04:18.866
but ever since the
bayou, something is off.

04:18.868 --> 04:21.135
What do you mean “off”?

04:22.538 --> 04:25.072
The mirror cracked in the exact shape

04:25.074 --> 04:27.541
of the sigil we've seen all over town.

04:27.543 --> 04:29.877
We killed witches who follow that.

04:29.879 --> 04:31.745
They tried to anchor it to our world.

04:31.747 --> 04:34.515
Now I think...

04:34.517 --> 04:36.484
I think it's anchored to me.

04:36.486 --> 04:38.219
Then you need a witch.

04:38.221 --> 04:40.788
A good one. I know someone.

04:40.790 --> 04:42.645
Yeah, I need a New Orleans witch.

04:42.648 --> 04:44.263
Vincent has a history with this thing,

04:44.266 --> 04:45.966
and this thing did just kill his friend,

04:45.969 --> 04:47.335
so I think he'll help me.

04:47.338 --> 04:49.244
And in the meantime,
I'm supposed to do what?

04:49.247 --> 04:51.165
Cross my fingers and
hope you're not possessed?

04:51.167 --> 04:54.068
That's not gonna happen to me.

04:54.070 --> 04:55.619
Good.

04:55.622 --> 04:59.940
'Cause I'm not letting you out
of my sight until you're cured.

04:59.942 --> 05:02.343
Hope?

05:03.179 --> 05:05.246
Hope?

05:18.022 --> 05:19.622
Today you will die

05:19.625 --> 05:21.158
at the hands of Marcel,

05:21.161 --> 05:23.461
unless you kill your enemy first.

05:30.239 --> 05:32.606
Dad?

05:37.180 --> 05:39.647
We're ready to go. Aren't you coming?

05:39.649 --> 05:42.816
You need to go to the bayou without me.

05:42.818 --> 05:44.185
- Why?
- Take Hope.

05:44.187 --> 05:45.686
- I'll be right behind you.
- Why?

05:45.688 --> 05:47.472
My daughter nearly died.

05:47.475 --> 05:49.308
I have to make sure the
threat to her is over.

05:49.311 --> 05:50.391
Not without me you cannot.

05:50.393 --> 05:53.627
Brother, hearcel
loathes you most of all.

05:53.629 --> 05:55.329
Freya will help me here.

05:55.331 --> 05:56.864
I need to know

05:56.866 --> 05:58.432
my child is safe.

05:58.434 --> 06:00.501
You and Hayley can assure that.

06:23.259 --> 06:24.758
Mm.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.294
Is this for me?

06:27.296 --> 06:30.264
Oh, sweet angel of mercy.

06:32.268 --> 06:35.703
Mmm. This almost makes up for
the whole kidnapping thing.

06:35.706 --> 06:39.840
Oh, let's not forget, that whole
kidnapping thing kept you alive.

06:39.842 --> 06:42.776
As for the coffee, it's
the least I could do,

06:42.778 --> 06:46.647
considering you helped
us make our breakthrough.

06:46.649 --> 06:48.449
The last I remember

06:48.451 --> 06:52.119
was... you saying you figured it out,

06:52.121 --> 06:53.575
and then we started

06:53.578 --> 06:56.178
drinking tequila like water.

06:56.181 --> 07:01.795
So how am I borderline comatose,
and you're Little Miss Sunshine?

07:01.797 --> 07:04.798
Because of this: hangover cure.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.400
Thousand years old.

07:08.037 --> 07:10.838
Also, because...

07:10.840 --> 07:13.440
mission accomplished.

07:13.442 --> 07:16.277
Do you really think that
weapon could kill Marcel?

07:16.279 --> 07:20.314
It took some time, my
blood, Esther's magic,

07:20.316 --> 07:23.117
Marcel's venom and the
ashes of Lucien Castle.

07:23.119 --> 07:26.353
Combined, it will be
powerful enough to kill him.

07:26.355 --> 07:28.889
So, we're done, then?

07:30.893 --> 07:33.427
Yeah, I go back to my
life, you go back to yours?

07:35.035 --> 07:36.468
Yeah.

07:38.434 --> 07:41.035
A deal's a deal.

07:45.101 --> 07:47.173
Hey, look, don't look so disappointed.

07:47.176 --> 07:48.742
I mean, this wasn't exactly built

07:48.744 --> 07:50.844
to be a long-term friendship.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.505
I guess this is good-bye.

07:59.552 --> 08:03.023
Like you said, mission accomplished.

08:05.094 --> 08:08.195
Okay. So, I'll see you.

08:09.398 --> 08:11.098
Okay.

08:24.980 --> 08:26.880
Vincent, it's me, again.

08:26.882 --> 08:28.716
We were supposed to meet an hour ago.

08:28.718 --> 08:31.385
All right, call me back
as soon as you get this.

08:31.387 --> 08:33.386
This is absurd. I'm calling my guy.

08:45.868 --> 08:47.200
All right, whoever you are,

08:47.203 --> 08:49.336
this is the wrong day
to be playing games.

08:54.777 --> 08:56.143
Elijah.

08:56.145 --> 08:57.678
What are you doing here?

08:57.680 --> 09:00.714
Did you not learn your lesson
the last time I put you down?

09:00.716 --> 09:03.417
Does this bravado help to
relieve your pathetic fear?

09:03.419 --> 09:05.486
Oh, you think I'm afraid of you?

09:05.488 --> 09:06.720
Terrified.

09:06.722 --> 09:08.389
I put you down twice before.

09:08.391 --> 09:10.657
Maybe the third time's the charm.

09:13.028 --> 09:15.198
The spirit I have seen may be the devil,

09:15.201 --> 09:18.603
and the devil hath power
to assume a pleasing shape.

09:20.936 --> 09:23.270
Do you not recall

09:23.272 --> 09:25.539
your Shakespeare, Marcellus?

09:27.309 --> 09:29.443
The ghost which appeared to Hamlet.

09:29.445 --> 09:32.012
And then, of course...

09:32.014 --> 09:34.448
unrelenting tragedy.

09:34.450 --> 09:37.351
You're not Elijah.

09:50.709 --> 09:53.544
Tell me again what
happened at this ritual.

09:53.546 --> 09:55.646
I fought evil, and I saved children.

09:55.648 --> 09:57.381
I should be given a medal.

09:57.384 --> 09:59.964
Instead, I've been infected
by some depraved ghost.

09:59.967 --> 10:00.918
Well, I know

10:00.920 --> 10:03.053
purging spells and cleansing rituals,

10:03.055 --> 10:04.840
so I can fix this.

10:04.843 --> 10:06.643
In the meantime, have you considered

10:06.646 --> 10:08.813
that you're not the only one infected?

10:10.229 --> 10:12.196
Marcel was exposed, as well.

10:12.198 --> 10:14.765
In your visions, our father's
goading you to kill your enemy.

10:14.767 --> 10:16.938
If Marcel has seen something similar...

10:16.941 --> 10:18.734
Then we're all on the chopping block.

10:18.737 --> 10:20.270
I need to purify you both.

10:20.272 --> 10:22.005
No! Not yet.

10:23.943 --> 10:27.177
If the Hollow can look into
me, then I can look back at it,

10:27.179 --> 10:29.213
find out what it is, what it wants.

10:30.783 --> 10:32.783
It's too dangerous, Klaus.

10:32.785 --> 10:34.985
This thing came after Hope.

10:38.257 --> 10:40.190
Fine.

10:40.192 --> 10:41.792
I'll give you an hour.

10:41.794 --> 10:43.994
And something else.

10:48.534 --> 10:52.703
The means to kill the
unkillable king of New Orleans.

10:53.512 --> 10:56.646
If Marcel comes after you, use this.

10:58.277 --> 11:00.644
Oh. You're mad I kept a secret from you?

11:00.646 --> 11:02.179
Fine.

11:02.181 --> 11:04.748
Chastise me once you've
made it through the day.

11:14.927 --> 11:16.693
I do miss it out here.

11:16.695 --> 11:18.621
Yeah, looks like you're not alone.

11:18.624 --> 11:20.697
You know, we could be happy out here.

11:23.636 --> 11:26.770
I think you might
stand out in that suit.

11:26.772 --> 11:29.740
Well, I was thinking jeans,
shorts and flip flops.

11:29.742 --> 11:32.542
I want to build a life with you, Elijah.

11:32.544 --> 11:34.077
With Hope.

11:34.079 --> 11:36.613
I want us to be happy.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.383
So we do that.

11:39.385 --> 11:41.585
Together.

11:44.189 --> 11:46.023
In jean shorts.

11:47.288 --> 11:49.726
- Grandma Mary!
- Well, hello, sweetheart.

11:49.728 --> 11:52.896
Oh, my girl. Oh.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.415
I picked you some flowers.

11:57.418 --> 11:59.460
Honey darling, why
don't you run on inside.

11:59.463 --> 12:00.937
I need to talk to your mama.

12:04.009 --> 12:06.410
Didn't know you were bringing him.

12:06.412 --> 12:08.811
Mary, come on.

12:08.814 --> 12:11.114
Vampires aren't welcome.

12:11.116 --> 12:12.285
You're the exception.

12:12.288 --> 12:14.121
Rules of the house.

12:15.934 --> 12:18.301
I'll leave you two.

12:23.475 --> 12:25.141
Seriously?

12:25.143 --> 12:26.709
You know how I feel.

12:26.711 --> 12:29.746
Our kind winds up dead
when they're around.

12:29.748 --> 12:31.147
Yesterday, we lost Lara.

12:31.149 --> 12:32.582
I wake up to hear there's been

12:32.584 --> 12:35.718
some kind of occult
massacre in the woods.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.587
Let me guess...

12:37.589 --> 12:39.122
Mikaelsons are involved.

12:39.124 --> 12:42.058
That's why I'm here.

12:42.060 --> 12:45.328
I want to talk about what really
caused that massacre last night.

12:49.534 --> 12:52.068
So young.

12:52.070 --> 12:55.138
And taken before her time.

12:55.140 --> 12:59.008
While those immortal tyrants
continue to wander free.

12:59.010 --> 13:00.643
What is this?

13:00.645 --> 13:04.047
Evil spirit appears to me
as the guy I hate, for what?

13:04.049 --> 13:05.415
Huh? To scare me?

13:05.417 --> 13:06.616
If this is all in my head,

13:06.618 --> 13:08.918
I could just as easily
wish your ass away.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.721
Your wishes won't bring back the dead.

13:11.723 --> 13:13.189
Nor will they grant you solace.

13:13.191 --> 13:16.626
Let's not forget, Elijah
killed you as well.

13:18.296 --> 13:20.597
Can you close your
eyes and wish that away?

13:20.599 --> 13:22.232
I betrayed you without a second thought.

13:22.234 --> 13:23.933
Give in to your desire.

13:23.935 --> 13:25.268
Seize your revenge.

13:25.270 --> 13:27.303
Why not start with me?

13:30.408 --> 13:32.775
What do you get out of me killing Klaus?

13:32.777 --> 13:34.077
Is this just a game?

13:34.079 --> 13:36.713
It is a game. And it's rather fun.

13:36.715 --> 13:38.414
You are here to deliver a sacrifice.

13:38.416 --> 13:40.250
Either Klaus or you.

13:40.252 --> 13:41.618
Two powerful souls,

13:41.620 --> 13:44.053
both fighting to the death.

13:44.055 --> 13:46.389
Now, doesn't that sound wonderful?

13:47.292 --> 13:49.425
Marcel! Hey!

13:49.427 --> 13:52.195
Hey. Hey, it's me.

13:55.567 --> 13:57.100
I knew this was bad.

13:57.102 --> 13:59.102
I have a witch on the way.

13:59.104 --> 14:01.271
You're coming with me.

14:01.273 --> 14:03.006
We're gonna fix you.

14:30.941 --> 14:32.307
Help me.

14:32.310 --> 14:34.837
Please. Help me.

14:34.839 --> 14:37.473
Mercy is for the weak!

14:40.812 --> 14:43.346
I assumed you'd run.

14:43.348 --> 14:46.616
Like the pathetic, sniveling
coward that you are.

14:47.619 --> 14:49.485
And I assume I have the misfortune

14:49.487 --> 14:51.287
of addressing the, uh...

14:51.289 --> 14:52.755
What was your name?

14:52.757 --> 14:54.190
The inept?

14:54.192 --> 14:55.458
The vacant?

14:55.460 --> 14:57.460
The Hollow. Yes.

14:57.462 --> 14:59.462
You address no one.

15:00.498 --> 15:02.966
I am not here.

15:02.968 --> 15:04.968
I'm only in your head.

15:04.970 --> 15:07.203
I can see your worst fear:

15:07.205 --> 15:10.106
the father that you loathed,
the terror that this is

15:10.108 --> 15:12.508
how your daughter may
one day perceive you.

15:12.510 --> 15:17.113
A depraved demon
sputtering psychoanalysis?

15:17.115 --> 15:20.516
Perhaps you speak from
personal experience.

15:20.518 --> 15:23.486
Do you come from a broken home?

15:23.488 --> 15:25.221
Daddy drank?

15:25.223 --> 15:26.823
Mommy never loved you?

15:26.825 --> 15:29.167
You seem to think Marcel
will kill me today.

15:29.170 --> 15:31.303
But he's had five years to do that.

15:31.305 --> 15:34.339
He didn't do it then.
He won't do it now.

15:34.341 --> 15:37.910
I, however, have long
had the will to end him.

15:37.912 --> 15:40.646
Now I have the weapon.

15:40.648 --> 15:43.482
Eager boy.

15:43.484 --> 15:46.351
You have shown that you
have a talent for brutality.

15:46.353 --> 15:49.154
But can you summon that same beast

15:49.156 --> 15:51.657
to do what is necessary today?

15:51.659 --> 15:55.227
When your once-beloved
son comes to finish you,

15:55.229 --> 15:57.696
will you kill him?

15:57.698 --> 16:00.499
Or die a coward?

16:00.501 --> 16:03.212
Let's find out, shall we?

16:28.912 --> 16:30.545
Forget something?

16:30.547 --> 16:33.815
Yeah. My Hippocratic oath.

16:33.817 --> 16:35.684
I was halfway to the bus station,

16:35.686 --> 16:37.452
and I realized that you're here alone,

16:37.454 --> 16:39.654
Marcel is still alive,

16:39.656 --> 16:42.290
and I'm bailing on you.

16:44.561 --> 16:46.461
And, all things considered,

16:46.463 --> 16:48.463
you did cure me of my curse, so...

16:48.465 --> 16:51.866
let's see this thing through.

16:51.868 --> 16:52.867
Well,

16:52.869 --> 16:55.904
I appreciate that, but, um, as usual,

16:55.906 --> 16:58.206
I'm in the middle of a family crisis.

16:58.208 --> 17:00.508
What'd they get into now?

17:02.145 --> 17:05.981
Last night, Klaus was
infected by dark magic,

17:05.983 --> 17:07.983
unlike any I've ever seen.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.531
This totem

17:09.534 --> 17:12.420
represents that power, and
the only way to figure out

17:12.422 --> 17:14.723
how to heal him is to channel it,

17:14.724 --> 17:16.724
which will give it access to me.

17:16.727 --> 17:18.359
That sounds safe.

17:19.796 --> 17:23.031
Okay, look, not to tell you
how to handle your sorcery,

17:23.032 --> 17:25.233
but you haven't slept in days,

17:25.234 --> 17:26.701
you're dehydrated, stressed.

17:26.703 --> 17:28.837
I don't have a choice.

17:30.107 --> 17:32.540
Okay. Then let me help.

17:33.910 --> 17:36.578
That's what friends do, right?

17:41.551 --> 17:43.051
All we know is

17:43.053 --> 17:45.487
this cult wanted to sacrifice children.

17:45.489 --> 17:47.489
Somehow Lara got caught up in it,

17:47.491 --> 17:50.091
and when she tried to
get out, she couldn't,

17:50.093 --> 17:51.426
and she killed herself.

17:51.428 --> 17:52.861
Doesn't make sense.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.530
Someone is recruiting
Crescents into a cult?

17:55.532 --> 17:57.632
That's what I need you
to look out for, Mary...

17:57.634 --> 17:59.000
Anything strange.

17:59.002 --> 18:01.403
These people obsess
over specific imagery.

18:01.405 --> 18:03.605
It's a... serpent

18:03.607 --> 18:04.939
eating its own tail.

18:04.941 --> 18:06.174
What'd you say?

18:06.176 --> 18:09.277
A serpent. Like a... dragon.

18:09.279 --> 18:11.780
When Hope was affected, she drew some.

18:13.274 --> 18:14.490
Here.

18:21.925 --> 18:24.659
There's something you need to see.

18:29.933 --> 18:32.133
This guy, Dominic... you trust him?

18:32.135 --> 18:34.202
Loyalty is good for business,

18:34.204 --> 18:36.104
and I give him a lot of business.

18:37.140 --> 18:40.375
This spirit... it's ancient.

18:40.377 --> 18:44.446
It ebbs and flows like the
tide, feeding and sleeping.

18:44.448 --> 18:45.947
So, it's awake,

18:45.949 --> 18:47.482
and I'm lunch.

18:47.484 --> 18:50.418
Well, it wants power.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.120
You're powerful.

18:52.122 --> 18:54.622
Right now it's stuck,

18:54.624 --> 18:56.491
caught between the world of the living

18:56.493 --> 18:59.761
and... wherever it was trapped.

18:59.763 --> 19:01.296
Was trappe?

19:01.298 --> 19:02.564
It broke free.

19:02.566 --> 19:03.998
Some time ago, there must have been

19:04.000 --> 19:05.500
a massive release of energy.

19:05.502 --> 19:08.036
The Ancestral Realm.

19:08.038 --> 19:10.672
When Vincent blew the link,
he must've set it free.

19:12.476 --> 19:14.275
How do we get this thing off Marcel?

19:14.277 --> 19:16.277
Purification could work.

19:16.279 --> 19:18.514
Unless it comes back.

19:18.517 --> 19:21.116
Best bet, you'll have to
send this thing back to sleep.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.785
See, spirits are just
another form of power.

19:23.787 --> 19:27.555
They can be channeled,
deflected, blocked.

19:29.025 --> 19:30.859
These beads keep me safe.

19:30.861 --> 19:35.697
They prevent any and all
spirits from infecting my head.

19:35.699 --> 19:37.465
I could purify some for you,

19:37.467 --> 19:40.034
adjust them to your
condition, of course.

19:40.036 --> 19:42.170
Yeah, all right, let's do it.

19:42.172 --> 19:43.972
But to sever the spirit's link,

19:43.974 --> 19:46.207
you're gonna have to bury the beads

19:46.209 --> 19:48.476
at the root of this creature's power.

19:48.478 --> 19:50.111
Well, how do I do that?

19:50.113 --> 19:53.848
Is there any place that it
has manifested itself before?

19:53.850 --> 19:56.151
Vincent mentioned an abandoned house.

19:56.153 --> 19:59.187
This thing lured kids there,
attacked them, attacked Vincent.

19:59.189 --> 20:00.955
All right,

20:00.957 --> 20:02.957
- then let's end this.
- All right.

20:02.959 --> 20:04.259
I'll get started.

20:07.230 --> 20:09.264
I can't let you come with me.

20:09.266 --> 20:10.632
I got to do this alone.

20:10.634 --> 20:13.535
I don't take orders from you.

20:23.580 --> 20:25.580
Please stay here.

20:25.582 --> 20:27.182
So I know you're safe.

20:37.160 --> 20:39.327
You know your way around, don't you?

20:39.329 --> 20:41.930
New Orleans native, I take it?

20:41.932 --> 20:45.900
I wonder, were you buried
somewhere in the vicinity?

20:45.902 --> 20:47.669
Perhaps someone disturbed your tomb.

20:47.671 --> 20:50.205
Is that why you're such an angry ghost?

20:53.296 --> 20:56.597
You don't intend to kill Marcel, do you?

20:57.446 --> 20:58.880
Your father was right.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.381
You are a coward.

21:00.383 --> 21:02.683
Because of you, he's
lost everyone he loved.

21:02.686 --> 21:04.152
And now, due to

21:04.154 --> 21:08.289
your pathetic fear of Marcel,
you will suffer the same fate.

21:08.291 --> 21:09.824
More meaningless threats.

21:09.826 --> 21:12.260
Is that the extent of your power?

21:12.997 --> 21:14.729
I remain underwhelmed.

21:14.731 --> 21:17.065
You think I'm powerless?

21:20.481 --> 21:25.073
I can make you see and
feel whatever I like.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.708
Do your worst.

21:26.710 --> 21:28.276
I know the truth.

21:28.278 --> 21:30.511
The white oak is gone, Mikael is dead,

21:30.513 --> 21:32.801
and you are nothing
more than a bad dream.

21:32.804 --> 21:36.284
Well, then maybe I'll find my
way into your daughter's dreams.

21:36.286 --> 21:37.285
What fun

21:37.287 --> 21:38.586
it will be to be

21:38.588 --> 21:40.154
in her head.

21:41.958 --> 21:44.626
Ruthless. Nicely done.

22:04.063 --> 22:06.914
Imagine if I made you kill
someone you cared about.

22:06.916 --> 22:09.450
Maybe I already have.

22:12.322 --> 22:15.023
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:15.025 --> 22:17.058
Freya...

22:18.795 --> 22:21.829
Next time, it might even be Hope.

22:21.831 --> 22:22.797
No!

22:22.799 --> 22:24.299
Even if you could resist,

22:24.301 --> 22:25.700
who will stop Marcel?

22:25.702 --> 22:27.635
After all, I'm having my fun with him.

22:27.637 --> 22:29.937
And I will make him

22:29.939 --> 22:32.473
tear through your family
like you have these people.

22:33.710 --> 22:34.909
Now,

22:34.911 --> 22:39.814
you only have the one choice, boy.

22:39.816 --> 22:41.716
Kill Marcel...

22:43.286 --> 22:48.089
or he will kill you
and everyone you love.

23:05.026 --> 23:08.694
This journal belonged to Mary's husband.

23:08.696 --> 23:11.430
He filled it in the
months before he died.

23:11.432 --> 23:13.165
Most of it's revolutionist garbage...

23:13.167 --> 23:14.372
Plots for an uprising...

23:14.375 --> 23:16.735
But there's stuff about
my parents in there.

23:17.538 --> 23:19.238
What does he say about them?

23:19.240 --> 23:20.439
Ramblings about

23:20.441 --> 23:23.342
how they were traitors
for dealing with vampires.

23:29.217 --> 23:32.480
You can see his writing
deteriorate as his thoughts.

23:32.483 --> 23:35.985
In the end, he can't even
form a coherent sentence.

23:45.097 --> 23:48.632
Elijah, I think the Hollow made
Mary's husband kill my parents.

23:58.716 --> 24:01.880
Klaus, I was worried.

24:01.883 --> 24:04.216
Freya, stay back.

24:04.218 --> 24:07.219
What's wrong?

24:07.221 --> 24:10.122
I don't want to hurt you.

24:10.124 --> 24:12.057
But I can't trust myself.

24:12.059 --> 24:13.526
I trust you...

24:13.528 --> 24:15.628
I said stay back!

24:18.086 --> 24:20.286
I've underestimated our foe.

24:21.790 --> 24:25.024
The Hollow is more
powerful than I thought.

24:25.026 --> 24:28.503
It made me see things

24:28.506 --> 24:30.606
and do things.

24:34.836 --> 24:38.137
I can feel it in my head.

24:40.041 --> 24:41.641
Then let me purify you.

24:41.643 --> 24:43.776
Okay?

24:49.050 --> 24:51.718
Reinigen monde tavo

24:51.720 --> 24:52.986
veneno.

24:52.988 --> 24:55.421
Reinigen monde tavo ven...

24:58.059 --> 24:59.792
It's burrowed too deep.

25:02.397 --> 25:04.497
But I know what it wants.

25:07.769 --> 25:11.137
For me to kill Marcel.

25:11.139 --> 25:13.039
Or for him to kill me.

25:13.041 --> 25:16.075
Klaus, if this thing is
demanding a blood sacrifice,

25:16.077 --> 25:18.444
if it's you or Marcel...

25:19.981 --> 25:22.482
don't let it be you.

25:24.509 --> 25:28.354
Hunt down Marcel and end this.

25:30.692 --> 25:32.859
Don't follow me.

25:42.670 --> 25:44.237
You never stop, do you?

25:44.239 --> 25:47.740
Just, every day you do a
spell, vanquish some evil,

25:47.742 --> 25:50.643
do another spell, rinse and repeat.

25:50.645 --> 25:52.612
I have hobbies.

25:52.614 --> 25:55.615
For instance, I collect
the ashes of my enemies.

25:55.617 --> 25:58.117
My point is that even during

25:58.119 --> 26:01.587
my most traumatic hospital
rotations, I'd make time.

26:01.589 --> 26:03.990
Ten minutes, one minute,
whatever I could steal,

26:03.992 --> 26:07.727
to go up to the roof, look up
at the sky, and just breathe.

26:07.729 --> 26:09.929
Remind myself that
there was a whole world

26:09.931 --> 26:13.066
away from the madness of the E.R.

26:13.068 --> 26:16.910
I'll-I'll care a lot more
about that world

26:16.913 --> 26:19.505
once I know my brother's safe.

26:20.475 --> 26:23.676
Anything strange happens...

26:23.678 --> 26:25.344
just wake me up, okay?

26:25.346 --> 26:28.281
Okay.

26:30.685 --> 26:34.921
Din montre otimo sekre.

26:34.923 --> 26:37.056
Din montre otimo sekre.

26:37.058 --> 26:40.526
Din montre otimo sekre.

26:40.528 --> 26:43.329
Din montre otimo sekre.

26:43.331 --> 26:45.765
Din montre otimo sekre.

26:45.767 --> 26:48.301
Din montre otimo sekre.

26:48.303 --> 26:50.736
This is officially strange.

26:50.738 --> 26:52.605
Din montre otimo sekre.

26:52.607 --> 26:54.307
Din montre...

26:55.343 --> 26:56.409
Freya.

26:56.411 --> 26:58.377
Freya.

27:02.517 --> 27:04.117
Damn it, Freya!

27:04.886 --> 27:07.353
Hey. You okay?

27:09.491 --> 27:12.091
It wants Klaus and
Marcel to kill each other.

27:12.093 --> 27:15.128
And when they die, it will
absorb their power, and then...

27:15.130 --> 27:17.630
we'll never be able to stop it.

27:30.388 --> 27:32.044
Hello, Marcel.

27:34.516 --> 27:37.739
Seems neither of us is to
leave until one of us dies.

27:37.742 --> 27:39.675
I know you're seeing things, Klaus.

27:39.678 --> 27:41.845
But I have a way to
fix that for both of us.

27:41.848 --> 27:43.656
And I'm to take your word for it, am I?

27:43.658 --> 27:45.458
Oh, don't be stupid. You can't beat me.

27:45.460 --> 27:47.894
Oh, but I can.

27:47.896 --> 27:48.861
You see,

27:48.863 --> 27:51.197
courtesy of my dear sister.

27:51.199 --> 27:54.433
Now you're not so unkillable after all.

28:10.042 --> 28:11.324
You can't just take off.

28:11.327 --> 28:14.445
That thing is forcing my brother
into a sacrificial bloodbath.

28:14.447 --> 28:17.482
Freya, you're bleeding.

28:18.718 --> 28:21.186
- Oh...
- You need stitches.

28:21.987 --> 28:24.254
It'll have to wait. You're not gonna

28:24.257 --> 28:26.658
do your brother any good
if you have head trauma.

28:27.828 --> 28:29.627
At least let me go with you.

28:29.629 --> 28:30.929
I am not useless in a fight.

28:30.931 --> 28:32.730
- I can control my form.
- Hey.

28:33.305 --> 28:35.839
I can take care of myself, okay?

28:36.804 --> 28:38.036
Trust me.

28:55.789 --> 28:59.524
Growing up, I never belonged anywhere.

28:59.526 --> 29:01.492
Not in school.

29:01.494 --> 29:03.461
Not in foster care.

29:03.463 --> 29:06.397
I always thought if I
could find my parents,

29:06.399 --> 29:08.366
I'd finally belong somewhere.

29:08.368 --> 29:10.702
You do belong somewhere.

29:13.807 --> 29:17.809
I did terrible things to
find my family, Elijah.

29:17.811 --> 29:20.445
And when I did, they were already dead.

29:22.215 --> 29:26.217
And now I find out that the same
people who killed them are...

29:26.219 --> 29:27.852
the ones who hurt Hope.

29:27.854 --> 29:29.187
Listen to me.

29:29.189 --> 29:32.557
I will not let anything happen to you.

29:32.559 --> 29:34.392
Do you understand?

29:44.735 --> 29:46.804
- What is it?
- You need to come back

29:46.806 --> 29:49.040
to the city, or Marcel's
going to kill Klaus.

29:56.016 --> 29:58.516
Of course. You say our
feud is over, but you're off

29:58.518 --> 30:00.285
building a weapon that can kill me.

30:00.287 --> 30:02.553
Well, I wouldn't need it if
I knew you could be trusted!

30:02.555 --> 30:05.390
Well, trust me now and
we both ott to live!

30:05.392 --> 30:07.058
How can you trust yourself?

30:07.060 --> 30:09.327
Spelled beads keep me
safe from this damn thing.

30:09.329 --> 30:11.963
I bury these here and
we're done, all right?

30:11.965 --> 30:13.331
No need to fight.

30:13.333 --> 30:15.833
He hopes to lower your
guard with his lies.

30:15.835 --> 30:17.101
Then he will wrench the dagger

30:17.103 --> 30:18.303
out of your hand.

30:18.305 --> 30:19.637
Don't be a fool.

30:21.474 --> 30:23.675
I am no fool.

30:45.465 --> 30:47.432
Repo oma dal most.

30:47.434 --> 30:50.702
Repo oma dal most. Repo oma dal most.

30:50.704 --> 30:53.338
Damn it, Klaus, I didn't come to fight.

30:53.340 --> 30:54.605
All right? Put the weapon down.

30:54.607 --> 30:57.942
My family won't be safe
unless you're put down!

31:03.083 --> 31:06.951
Repo oma dal most.
Repo oma dal most.

31:12.826 --> 31:15.126
End this.

31:15.128 --> 31:17.061
There is no other way.

31:22.651 --> 31:24.418
Need a hand?

31:28.108 --> 31:30.375
Repo oma dal most.

31:30.377 --> 31:32.343
Repo oma dal most.

31:32.345 --> 31:34.412
Repo oma dal most.

31:34.414 --> 31:36.180
Repo oma dal most.

31:36.182 --> 31:37.415
Repo...

31:51.431 --> 31:53.331
Repo oma dal most.

31:53.333 --> 31:55.066
Repo oma dal most.

31:55.068 --> 31:59.003
Repo oma dal most. Repo oma dal most.

32:04.277 --> 32:06.844
I should've killed you
when I had the chance.

32:06.846 --> 32:08.713
Your mistake.

32:13.745 --> 32:15.820
Fight, you coward,

32:15.822 --> 32:17.922
or today will be your daughter's last.

32:18.892 --> 32:20.391
I won't let you hurt my child.

32:20.393 --> 32:23.761
Do it now, or forever be a
servant to the Mikaelsons.

32:27.901 --> 32:30.668
I'm not this thing's puppet.

32:30.670 --> 32:32.937
And neither are you. All
right, we cannot give it

32:32.939 --> 32:34.639
what it wants.

32:34.641 --> 32:36.207
Someone will.

32:43.917 --> 32:46.117
Kill your son, Klaus.

32:46.119 --> 32:47.351
Otherwise, I will find a way

32:47.353 --> 32:50.488
to control him, and
Hope will never be safe.

33:02.969 --> 33:06.404
Mercy... is for the weak!

33:22.322 --> 33:24.655
Leave my family alone!

33:58.265 --> 34:02.768
I prefer my mind remain
unaltered for the time being.

34:02.771 --> 34:04.584
Weird.

34:04.586 --> 34:06.653
I feel the exact opposite.

34:06.655 --> 34:09.121
Rest easy, brother.

34:09.123 --> 34:11.757
My spells have Marcel bound and cloaked.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.994
Even more, I can find no trace

34:13.996 --> 34:15.976
of the Hollow's magic in either of you.

34:15.978 --> 34:18.063
- So where has it gone?
- It's a ghost.

34:18.065 --> 34:20.300
It could be anywhere, and since we know

34:20.302 --> 34:22.538
that it still wants to
sacrifice someone powerful,

34:22.541 --> 34:24.270
we have to be prepared.

34:24.272 --> 34:27.239
I think I'll hold on to it for now.

34:27.242 --> 34:29.676
This wasn't a gift.

34:29.678 --> 34:31.311
Today proved Marcel's a threat,

34:31.313 --> 34:33.364
whether used as a
sacrifice or possessed.

34:33.367 --> 34:34.043
Regardless...

34:34.047 --> 34:36.748
What good is having a
weapon if you won't use it?

34:36.751 --> 34:38.217
Niklaus, give it to her.

34:43.712 --> 34:47.746
Having a monopoly of power
makes you a target, sister.

34:48.784 --> 34:49.983
Remember that.

34:54.824 --> 34:56.790
You think I spared Marcel

34:56.792 --> 34:59.426
out of some mawkish sentimentality.

34:59.428 --> 35:02.296
The Hollow wanted both of us dead.

35:02.298 --> 35:04.998
Killing him would have
given it what it wanted.

35:06.869 --> 35:10.137
Mercy was necessary. That's all.

35:32.761 --> 35:35.262
Don't do that.

35:36.131 --> 35:37.764
Do what?

35:38.567 --> 35:40.567
Blame yourself.

35:40.569 --> 35:42.269
You think that

35:42.271 --> 35:44.238
if you'd stopped your husband, I...

35:44.240 --> 35:46.006
would have had a better life.

35:47.643 --> 35:50.611
No one deserves what
you've been through.

35:56.819 --> 36:00.220
It's because of what I've
been through that I have her.

36:05.294 --> 36:09.363
She is a Mikaelson and
I am a Marshall, but...

36:09.365 --> 36:11.565
we're both still Labonairs.

36:12.902 --> 36:14.635
Mary, Jackson said that tragedy

36:14.637 --> 36:16.403
always followed my family around...

36:16.405 --> 36:19.339
Executions, people
dying in floods, fires,

36:19.341 --> 36:22.576
or just vanishing.

36:22.578 --> 36:25.846
What if the Hollow is
behind those deaths, too?

36:27.616 --> 36:31.985
And if it went after
the Labonairs before...

36:31.987 --> 36:34.721
what if it wan w to
finish what it started.

36:48.604 --> 36:50.103
Ooh.

36:50.105 --> 36:52.739
The mighty Freya Mikaelson
felled by antiseptic.

36:56.387 --> 36:58.879
Keelin...

36:58.881 --> 37:00.681
thank you.

37:02.685 --> 37:04.518
Is that gratitude?

37:04.520 --> 37:06.954
From the Viking witch
who spends her days

37:06.956 --> 37:10.357
channeling evil spirits
to save vampire brothers?

37:10.359 --> 37:12.559
Yeah, you got a concussion.

37:17.499 --> 37:19.433
Sometimes...

37:19.435 --> 37:24.237
I'm forced to do
things that I... regret.

37:24.239 --> 37:26.373
And...

37:26.375 --> 37:28.475
for what I did to you...

37:33.184 --> 37:34.848
Sorry.

37:34.850 --> 37:36.516
I get it.

37:36.518 --> 37:39.720
At the end of the day,
what you did was for family.

37:41.023 --> 37:44.257
And if mine were still
alive, I'd do the same.

37:46.128 --> 37:47.794
Just don't ever mess with me again.

38:07.249 --> 38:09.249
Did you come to gloat?

38:09.251 --> 38:13.453
Five years ago, I was
forced to make a decision:

38:13.455 --> 38:15.789
take your life...

38:15.791 --> 38:17.624
or lose everything.

38:17.626 --> 38:19.993
Yeah, I know. I was there.

38:19.995 --> 38:21.094
Niklaus was faced

38:21.096 --> 38:23.196
with a similar decision today.

38:25.100 --> 38:27.934
And here you are.

38:27.936 --> 38:30.170
And here I am.

38:30.172 --> 38:34.241
Excuse me if I don't
express my gratitude.

38:34.243 --> 38:35.509
He's changing.

38:35.511 --> 38:37.044
Oh, really?

38:37.046 --> 38:39.813
He put me in the same
place that I kept him.

38:39.815 --> 38:41.615
That's revenge.

38:41.617 --> 38:45.385
So... same old Klaus.

38:50.859 --> 38:54.261
Well...

38:54.263 --> 38:57.464
I would say that he would
describe this as strategy.

38:58.333 --> 38:59.713
You and I,

38:59.716 --> 39:02.536
we both know he's always regarded you

39:02.538 --> 39:05.972
as something of a son.

39:06.699 --> 39:08.666
So did I, once upon a time.

39:12.014 --> 39:13.680
In fact, I used to believe

39:13.682 --> 39:16.283
that you were the key to
my brother's redemption.

39:16.285 --> 39:17.951
Redemption?

39:17.953 --> 39:19.486
He's never gonna change.

39:19.488 --> 39:21.188
Not even for his own daughter.

39:21.190 --> 39:22.456
Oh, he already has.

39:22.458 --> 39:24.758
She has changed him.

39:25.828 --> 39:29.563
You, Marcellus, you are not needed,

39:29.565 --> 39:31.631
welcome or wanted.

39:31.633 --> 39:34.634
You have only been spared
purely because you are

39:34.636 --> 39:36.703
my brother's greatest weakness.

39:36.705 --> 39:39.005
And I cannot show

39:39.007 --> 39:41.308
any mercy to anyone who
would demonstrate threat

39:41.310 --> 39:42.843
towards this family.

39:42.845 --> 39:44.693
And if indeed you should prevent

39:44.696 --> 39:47.481
the redemption of the cruel,

39:47.483 --> 39:49.683
the wicked, the vindictive

39:49.685 --> 39:52.385
Niklaus Mikaelson...

39:55.524 --> 39:59.326
I promise you...

39:59.328 --> 40:03.363
I will deliver another
kind of nightmare.

40:06.635 --> 40:08.802
Sweet dreams, Marcellus.

40:08.804 --> 40:12.105
Elijah. Elijah.

40:12.107 --> 40:14.307
Elijah!

40:41.403 --> 40:43.837
You lied to me.

40:45.174 --> 40:47.174
I wanted Klaus dead. We had a deal.

40:47.176 --> 40:49.042
Marcel getting taken

40:49.044 --> 40:51.378
was not part of it.

40:51.380 --> 40:53.880
- I should kill you.
- You could.

40:53.882 --> 40:55.816
But then you'll never get what you want.

40:56.773 --> 40:58.773
Marcel's blood was spilled today.

41:07.196 --> 41:10.497
As he is the only one who
can kill an Original...

41:14.269 --> 41:16.970
the Hollow has received this offering

41:16.972 --> 41:19.206
and given us a gift in return.

41:19.208 --> 41:21.308
A single scratch

41:21.310 --> 41:24.344
from that thorn will kill an Original.

41:24.346 --> 41:26.313
And we both get what we want.

41:26.315 --> 41:30.684
You want a blood sacrifice for
your dead witch, I don't care.

41:30.686 --> 41:33.386
All I want is my revenge.
