Eee!
It's a family reunion.

00:42.016 --> 00:44.021
Oscar, I keep telling you.

00:44.023 --> 00:47.005
I'm a cute little wooly mammoth.

00:47.007 --> 00:49.001
You're an elephant.

00:49.003 --> 00:51.015
Yeah!
We're elephantidaes.

00:51.017 --> 00:53.014
I was thinking our first
family-versary

00:53.016 --> 00:55.012
can be
our Mushroom Anniversary.

00:55.014 --> 00:58.013
I made cream of mushroom soup,
a mushroom galette,

00:58.015 --> 01:00.003
and mushrooms with herbs.

01:00.005 --> 01:03.013
'Midst doom and gloom,
one may consume whom?

01:03.015 --> 01:04.014
A mushroom!

01:04.016 --> 01:06.015
Happiness resumed!

01:06.017 --> 01:08.001
Blech!

01:08.003 --> 01:09.022
You don't like mushrooms?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.008
Not really, no.

01:11.010 --> 01:13.000
Here,
you haven't tried mine.

01:13.002 --> 01:18.008
Uhm, no thanks, they uh, make
your hair turn into spaghetti!

01:18.010 --> 01:19.017
Not your hair!

01:19.019 --> 01:22.001
You have the best hair
in the whole family.

01:22.003 --> 01:24.008
Oscar we're -- we're not --
you know what.

01:24.010 --> 01:26.008
Let's do something else.

01:26.010 --> 01:27.015
If you come over to
my house,

01:27.017 --> 01:30.001
I'll make us
some dancing banana peels.

01:30.003 --> 01:31.019
Okay.

01:38.008 --> 01:39.020
Come on, bubby.

01:43.010 --> 01:45.008
What was that Alice said
about mushrooms?

01:45.010 --> 01:47.008
They make your hair
turn into spaghetti!

01:47.010 --> 01:48.018
Whaaa!?

01:48.020 --> 01:50.000
I didn't know that!

01:52.003 --> 01:54.005
Oh, my gosh,
make them shush.

01:56.007 --> 01:58.000
Do you think it happens
to arm hair?

01:58.002 --> 01:59.006
What about knee hair?

01:59.008 --> 02:01.004
Mushrooms turn your hair
into spaghetti!

02:01.006 --> 02:02.009
Pass it on.

02:02.011 --> 02:04.000
Mushrooms turn your hair
into spaghetti!

02:04.002 --> 02:06.000
...she went to the hairdresser,
and the hairdresser said,

02:06.002 --> 02:08.022
"No way, Jose, I can't do
a thing with it,"

02:09.000 --> 02:10.012
And now they're
not friends anymore!

02:10.014 --> 02:12.013
And everyone started calling him
"spaghetti hair"

02:12.015 --> 02:16.001
and "pesto hair-do" and he never
got asked to the prom.

02:16.003 --> 02:18.020
Flower #
And they had to close their
business and sell their house

02:18.022 --> 02:20.020
and move
into the desert forever.

02:20.022 --> 02:22.021
All because they ate a mushroom.

02:22.023 --> 02:26.009
Which made their hair
turn into spaghetti!

02:26.011 --> 02:28.014
Who told you that?

02:31.011 --> 02:33.022
Ahhhh.
This never gets old.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.001
Mm-hmm.

02:36.003 --> 02:39.006
<i>The Death Cap is coming.</i>

02:39.008 --> 02:42.006
<i>The Death Cap is coming!</i>

02:42.008 --> 02:46.021
The Death Cap
is coming!

02:47.000 --> 02:48.007
Oh, crumbs!

02:48.009 --> 02:49.010
Don't worry, Alice!

02:49.012 --> 02:51.002
Clumsiness runs
in the family.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.018
No bubby,
I had a premonition!

02:53.020 --> 02:56.003
The Death Cap is coming
for me!

02:56.005 --> 02:57.021
Whoa, what's the Death Cap?

02:57.023 --> 03:00.004
Actually, first,
what's a premonition?

03:00.006 --> 03:03.022
It's a vision of the future,
they're really important.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.006
Okay,
so what's the Death Cap?

03:06.008 --> 03:07.016
I don't know.

03:07.018 --> 03:09.013
The Witch library can help us.

03:09.015 --> 03:11.011
To the library!

03:11.013 --> 03:12.020
Waah!

03:14.014 --> 03:17.013
Sorry.

03:17.015 --> 03:20.000
Okay, here we are.

03:20.002 --> 03:21.021
"Common Prems."

03:24.002 --> 03:25.023
Death cap, Death Cap...

03:26.001 --> 03:27.006
Uh, eh, here!

03:27.008 --> 03:29.021
Among their duties are dealing
with people

03:29.023 --> 03:31.018
who spread "Mushrumors."

03:31.020 --> 03:35.019
Negative speak about anyone
in the mushroom community.

03:35.021 --> 03:38.019
They're hunting me because
of what I said at the picnic.

03:38.021 --> 03:41.006
About Mushrooms turning
your hair into spaghetti?

03:41.008 --> 03:43.005
That's important information!

03:43.007 --> 03:45.014
I might have made that up.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.017
Why don't you sincerely
apologize!

03:47.019 --> 03:51.000
That's how I fix all my stuff.

03:51.002 --> 03:53.012
We can apologize
to this fairy ring.

03:53.014 --> 03:54.010
Fairies?!

03:54.012 --> 03:55.015
I was wondering when fairies

03:55.017 --> 03:57.003
were gonna show up
on this island!

03:57.005 --> 03:59.023
Ew. No.
Fairies aren't real, Oscar.

04:00.001 --> 04:02.022
A fairy ring is a ring
of mushrooms.

04:05.003 --> 04:07.003
Well my quantum theories
tend to start

04:07.005 --> 04:09.002
with the macro versus the micro.

04:09.004 --> 04:10.003
Hello?
Ah!

04:10.005 --> 04:13.003
Heh...
um, I was wondering,

04:13.005 --> 04:14.012
I don't know
if you guys heard anything

04:14.014 --> 04:18.016
about mushrooms --
about yourselves recently...

04:18.018 --> 04:22.000
What, like how we'll make
your hair turn into spaghetti?

04:22.002 --> 04:24.020
Causing a lack of faith in the
permanence of our objectivity

04:24.022 --> 04:26.012
leading to a crisis
of identity

04:26.014 --> 04:30.004
in which we all are
just subjective constructs?

04:30.006 --> 04:31.013
Yeah...

04:31.015 --> 04:33.017
I'm really sorry about that.

04:33.019 --> 04:35.004
That was you?

04:35.006 --> 04:36.009
How could you?!

04:36.011 --> 04:38.015
I didn't mean for it
to get so out of hand...

04:38.017 --> 04:42.012
I just didn't want to eat
any of Oscar's mushrooms.

04:44.010 --> 04:47.009
Well. Thank you for being
so forthcoming.

04:47.011 --> 04:50.013
We accept your apology.

04:50.015 --> 04:52.019
How'd it go?
Really great!

04:52.021 --> 04:54.003
Now c'mon!

04:54.005 --> 04:57.018
We still have to finish
our dancing banana peel-sss.

04:57.020 --> 05:00.007
<i>The Death Cap is coming.</i>

05:03.023 --> 05:05.006
Aah!

05:05.008 --> 05:07.010
But what I am saying is that
they are interchangeable,

05:07.012 --> 05:08.011
your subjective --
Aah!

05:08.013 --> 05:11.002
The Death Cap is still coming!

05:11.004 --> 05:12.020
I thought you
called her off?!

05:12.022 --> 05:14.013
Oh...
we can't stop her.

05:14.015 --> 05:16.015
It's one of those things
where you summon her,

05:16.017 --> 05:18.016
and her wheels are in motion.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.019
But I apologized!

05:20.021 --> 05:23.004
And we appreciate that.

05:23.006 --> 05:24.005
Psst.

05:24.007 --> 05:26.023
Can we talk?

05:27.001 --> 05:28.001
Listen, Alice.

05:28.003 --> 05:31.007
Once I wore a vest to school.

05:31.009 --> 05:32.017
One person hated it.

05:32.019 --> 05:36.009
Then, the next day, I wore
pants, and that same person...

05:36.011 --> 05:37.018
he loved them!

05:37.020 --> 05:40.004
He told everybody that I had
really good fashion sense.

05:40.006 --> 05:44.003
And I went from hating him back
to never thinking about him!

05:44.005 --> 05:47.001
Oscar, did you not wear pants
the first time?

05:47.003 --> 05:49.021
What I'm saying is, if you talk
smack about someone

05:49.023 --> 05:51.023
and then you say
something nice about them,

05:52.001 --> 05:54.000
it brings it back
to a neutral zero!

05:54.002 --> 05:58.000
So you're saying I should start
a nice rumor about mushrooms.

05:58.002 --> 06:00.004
By jove,
I think she's got it.

06:00.006 --> 06:02.001
Well, yeah, that's a fine idea
and all,

06:02.003 --> 06:04.003
but how are we gonna spread
a reverse rumor

06:04.005 --> 06:07.014
fast enough to reach the
Death Cap before she reaches me?

06:07.016 --> 06:09.008
The same way we spread
the first one!

06:09.010 --> 06:11.019
We gotta go back
to our butt prints!

06:18.001 --> 06:19.004
Oh, no wonder!

06:19.006 --> 06:21.023
You had us picnic on top
of these big mouths.

06:22.001 --> 06:24.003
I was going to make you
a dandelion crown.

06:24.005 --> 06:27.005
Well, instead you made
a dandelion dish.

06:27.007 --> 06:30.014
And nothing dishes
like a dandelion.

06:30.016 --> 06:31.017
Hey...
Ahh!

06:31.019 --> 06:33.000
Can I bend your ear?

06:33.002 --> 06:37.016
I heard something crazy
about mushrooms.

06:37.018 --> 06:38.015
Go on...

06:38.017 --> 06:40.022
Uhh.
Mushrooms...

06:41.000 --> 06:43.016
they...taste...good?

06:45.005 --> 06:46.009
Eh.

06:46.011 --> 06:49.002
Come on!
That was hot off the press!

06:49.004 --> 06:51.007
Meh.
Everybody knows that.

06:51.009 --> 06:54.010
Tell us something
we don't know.

06:54.012 --> 06:58.018
Mushrooms will pick you up
from the airport?

06:58.020 --> 07:00.001
No duh!

07:00.003 --> 07:02.020
3 I heard this one mushroom
was picking up a friend

07:02.022 --> 07:05.010
and they had to sit through
three hours of traffic

07:05.012 --> 07:07.004
just to get to their gate.

07:07.006 --> 07:08.019
So nice.

07:12.017 --> 07:17.005
Mushrooms look good in a vest.

07:21.003 --> 07:25.000
Yeah and, now you're gonna
tell everyone that, right?

07:25.002 --> 07:27.011
Yeah, yeah!
As soon as the wind blows.

07:31.016 --> 07:32.022
Hmm...

07:33.000 --> 07:34.016
Still wet.

07:38.018 --> 07:41.013
Ah!

07:41.015 --> 07:44.001
Ah!
The Death Cap, she found me!

07:44.003 --> 07:45.012
Aah!

07:45.014 --> 07:47.007
I know witches really aren't
supposed to mess with nature,

07:47.009 --> 07:49.001
but if this good rumor's
gonna spread in time

07:49.003 --> 07:52.019
to save me, I'm gonna have
to magic up some wind.

07:52.021 --> 07:55.003
Okay, okay.
Okay.

07:55.005 --> 07:56.010
Oscar, shush!

07:56.012 --> 07:57.017
Okay...

07:57.019 --> 08:01.017
Ooo, wind will blow,
so my foe's woes goes!

08:01.019 --> 08:06.020
When I spin my toe,
let this rumor grow!

08:06.022 --> 08:09.014
Wooooo!

08:09.016 --> 08:11.006
It's working!

08:20.012 --> 08:22.013
Whoa, that worked super well.

08:22.015 --> 08:25.008
I should bend nature
to my will more often.

08:25.010 --> 08:27.013
Goodbye, forever angry
mushroom woman.

08:27.015 --> 08:29.004
Let's say we get outta here?

08:29.006 --> 08:31.009
Dancing banana sundaes on me.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.022
Yup, I'm comfortable
letting my guard down.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.005
Do my eyes deceive me or did
Alice try and do our job for
us?

08:38.007 --> 08:40.018
As in, make a little wind
of her own?!

08:40.020 --> 08:42.004
Let's teach her not to mess

08:42.006 --> 08:44.013
with the natural order,
shall we, Paul?

08:44.015 --> 08:46.011
Paul, P--
Hey, Paul!

08:46.013 --> 08:48.015
Let's teach her.
Yo, what?

08:48.017 --> 08:49.013
Just blow.

08:57.010 --> 08:58.017
Aah!

08:58.019 --> 09:01.023
Uuuuum...do you think the rumor
reached her yet?

09:02.001 --> 09:03.008
I do not!

09:07.022 --> 09:09.016
It's time.

09:09.018 --> 09:12.004
No!
Please spare me!

09:12.006 --> 09:13.023
I've got so much
left to give!

09:14.001 --> 09:15.007
And take!

09:15.009 --> 09:18.005
No!
Aaahhhh!

09:18.007 --> 09:19.019
Alice!

09:19.021 --> 09:22.000
Karma never loses an address.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.017
Where are you taking me?

09:25.019 --> 09:27.013
Is this really it for me?

09:27.015 --> 09:30.013
I've never even tried sushi.

09:30.015 --> 09:31.018
Hush now.

09:31.020 --> 09:33.020
We've arrived.

09:33.022 --> 09:35.012
Arrived where?

09:35.014 --> 09:36.015
Ohh?

09:36.017 --> 09:38.001
Whooooa.

09:38.003 --> 09:40.014
What on earth is that?

09:40.016 --> 09:43.021
Surely you are aware
of the Royal Mush?!

09:44.000 --> 09:46.011
It is I who summoned
the Death Cap!

09:46.013 --> 09:47.016
To teach you a lesson.

09:47.018 --> 09:48.022
I-I said I was sorry!

09:49.000 --> 09:50.008
I-I And...
and...

09:50.010 --> 09:53.000
you guys look amazing
in vests!

09:53.002 --> 09:55.005
We look amazing in everything!

09:55.007 --> 09:57.004
Your fate is sealed!

09:57.006 --> 09:59.012
Ah!
They're gonna eat me!

09:59.014 --> 10:00.023
Uh, no!

10:01.001 --> 10:03.003
They're gonna take my tongue
for spreading rumors!

10:03.005 --> 10:05.002
Ah!
Or both!

10:05.004 --> 10:06.019
No!
No, no, no, no!

10:06.021 --> 10:10.010
No, no! No!
Ahhhh!

10:10.012 --> 10:12.003
Mm?!

10:12.023 --> 10:14.009
Mmm.

10:14.011 --> 10:17.004
Wow, what was that?

10:17.006 --> 10:19.001
It can be no great mystery.

10:19.003 --> 10:21.021
You're tellin' me
that was a mushroom?

10:21.023 --> 10:23.020
A button mushroom!

10:23.022 --> 10:25.008
We heard
you didn't like them,

10:25.010 --> 10:29.009
and it's extremely important
that witches like mushrooms.

10:29.011 --> 10:31.009
They're an essential
part of magic!

10:31.011 --> 10:33.009
So what's the verdict?

10:33.011 --> 10:34.016
I'm guilty...

10:34.018 --> 10:35.021
of...

10:35.023 --> 10:37.012
loving it!

10:37.014 --> 10:40.019
