You got real lucky.

we actually cut a pot off.

Because when you put the chain
in the hook

snapped the wire once,

25:53.753 --> 25:55.853

uh, decades.

you got opinions,

26:10.803 --> 26:12.937

something one way,

26:16.943 --> 26:19.109
You can't change it in
the middle, you just can't.

26:19.111 --> 26:22.146
So, you gotta learn to zip
once in a while.
Stick to the plan, right?

26:22.615 --> 26:24.047

26:25.017 --> 26:29.019

We're lucky because if that
wire had come off there and
shorted inside of that servo,

36:50.776 --> 36:53.643
We probably wouldn't have
a rudder right now.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.813
Yeah and the last thing
we need to do is be

he can cover this.

you're even in rain gear
is a major miracle, okay?

39:01.940 --> 39:04.841
-Major physical miracle.
-[laughs]

39:04.910 --> 39:08.011
-Not the best string
