00:18.435 --> 00:21.146
Okay, let's see what we have.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.439
Yeah.

00:22.522 --> 00:25.192
Well, that is
one completely normal knee.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.111
Just stay off of it
for a couple of days...

00:28.195 --> 00:31.323
- Okay.
- ...and you'll be back to your old self.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.158
-So, nothing serious?
-Nothing serious.

00:33.241 --> 00:34.702
Yeah.

00:34.785 --> 00:37.496
It's just a little strain and, uh... Yeah.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.749
When you go out there,
you wanna give it your all,

00:40.832 --> 00:43.126
but you know,
you can go too far and then...

00:43.210 --> 00:45.087
You just never know
if it's... if it's your day.

00:45.170 --> 00:49.299
Uh, at the game, I could feel that I
cranked it coming off the mini tramp,

00:49.383 --> 00:51.593
-and I knew... I thought...
-I was at the game.

00:52.385 --> 00:53.428
And I...

00:53.511 --> 00:55.180
-You were at the game?
-I was. I was.

00:55.264 --> 00:56.723
You're a Herons fan?

00:56.807 --> 00:58.391
-Herons all the way.
-Wow! All right.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.977
-Great work, by the way.
-Thank you.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.937
Both of you. Really enjoy it.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.147
-What are you doing?
-You just had a piece of fuzz in your...

01:04.230 --> 01:06.274
Okay, but you can tell me
with your mouth and not your hands.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.443
- Okay. Well, you can also relax.
- Okay.

01:08.527 --> 01:09.570
Just a little bit.

01:09.653 --> 01:11.321
- For heaven's sakes.
- All right. Do you...

01:11.404 --> 01:13.323
do you prescribe antidepressants?

01:17.786 --> 01:19.913
<i>Mascotting is not unlike a marriage</i>

01:19.997 --> 01:21.957
<i>- in that it's about cooperation...</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

01:22.040 --> 01:24.585
<i>- ...it's about listening.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:24.668 --> 01:28.005
Even if people are screaming
at you, you're not allowed to talk.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.633
-And that's a good lesson for a marriage.
-Yeah.

01:30.716 --> 01:32.885
Fun story. Initially, we were going to be,

01:32.968 --> 01:35.721
uh, Kevin the Killer Whale
and Tammy Turtle,

01:35.804 --> 01:36.847
but then we discovered

01:36.930 --> 01:39.683
that the killer whale is the natural enemy
of the turtle.

01:39.767 --> 01:40.809
-Yeah.
-And they'll...

01:40.893 --> 01:43.311
You know, they'll just pop 'em open
like a pistachio.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.688
Oh, it's like a special treat
for them, yeah.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.815
Yeah, and they'll toy with them
for a half hour,

01:46.899 --> 01:48.734
-and then just break their necks.
-Yeah.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.402
So, we had to switch it up.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.571
Sometimes not even to eat 'em.
Just... just for fun.

01:52.655 --> 01:53.906
-It's a sadistic thing.
-Yeah.

01:53.989 --> 01:56.324
It's one of the few instances
of sadism in the animal world.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.410
So, we thought,
"Well, that's not gonna work for..."

01:58.493 --> 02:00.370
-"That doesn't fit."
-"It's not for the families."

02:00.453 --> 02:03.290
And we don't just work together
on the field.

02:03.373 --> 02:06.335
We are off the field over
at Rhea Perlman Middle School,

02:06.418 --> 02:07.795
where we are both teachers.

02:07.878 --> 02:11.131
Yeah, and they say that
those who can't do, teach,

02:11.214 --> 02:13.466
and those who can't teach, teach gym,

02:13.550 --> 02:15.510
and those who can't teach gym,
teach driver's ed.

02:15.593 --> 02:18.722
But, uh, joke's on them
because I teach gym and driver's ed.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.598
- I teach English.
- Yeah.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.476
Maybe just up a little bit higher.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.477
There you go.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.772
Up, up, up, up, up and stop.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.315
<i>I have been running on fumes.</i>

02:28.398 --> 02:30.608
I've been running around
like a chicken with my head cut off,

02:30.693 --> 02:33.111
and I think I've had maybe, oh...

02:33.195 --> 02:35.113
ten hours' sleep this entire week.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.489
But it's all gonna be worth it

02:36.573 --> 02:39.367
the second the first mascot
walks through these doors.

02:39.451 --> 02:42.954
We give away three Fluffy Awards
or, as we like to call them, "Fluffies."

02:43.789 --> 02:47.000
Bronze Fluffy,
Silver Fluffy and Gold Fluffy.

02:47.084 --> 02:50.712
And believe me, every mascot knows
just how important those awards can be,

02:51.463 --> 02:55.008
because if one of the winners were
to sign a major league contract,

02:55.092 --> 02:57.177
and it is possible that could happen,

02:57.260 --> 03:00.472
they could quite possibly
end up making a six-figure salary

03:00.555 --> 03:01.724
by this time next year.

03:01.807 --> 03:05.435
Mascots are coming
from every place you can imagine.

03:05.518 --> 03:09.397
Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky...

03:09.481 --> 03:10.482
Colorado...

03:11.608 --> 03:15.320
Oregon, Texas, New Mexico,

03:15.404 --> 03:17.406
Georgia, Florida...

03:18.281 --> 03:20.408
and then some other states, too.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.204
Wyoming, Utah...

03:25.038 --> 03:26.581
and several, several countries.

03:26.664 --> 03:29.251
This year is especially important

03:29.334 --> 03:33.797
because the Gluten Free Channel is sending
two executives to watch our show

03:33.880 --> 03:36.591
and determine whether or not they want
to have it on television.

03:36.674 --> 03:39.762
And if that happens, well...
it's like a whole new level.

03:43.348 --> 03:46.393
Hello, uh, I'm Owen Golly Jr.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.104
Um, I'm a third-generation
mascot and butcher.

03:49.855 --> 03:53.233
-Uh, this is my wife, Sarah Golly.
-Hello.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.860
She's not a junior.

03:54.943 --> 03:58.906
Uh, if they're gonna put it
at the bottom of the screen,

03:58.989 --> 04:01.699
-it reads, like, "Owen Golly, Jr."
-Yeah.

04:01.784 --> 04:03.786
And it's not. It's "Jolly."

04:03.869 --> 04:08.039
Uh, granddad... my granddad came up
with a little family phrase,

04:08.123 --> 04:11.919
which is, "Golly, gosh, no!
We're not posh, no.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.046
We're jolly, as in gay."

04:14.963 --> 04:17.925
But it meant...
"Gay" meant something different...

04:18.007 --> 04:20.010
-It was different in olden times.
-...in my granddad's day, uh,

04:20.093 --> 04:23.764
which I discovered
on my first day at school,

04:23.847 --> 04:25.140
when I corrected a teacher.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.435
My classmates loved that one.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.896
So, that was my nickname for a bit.

04:30.979 --> 04:34.274
Golly the Gay, Golly Gosh Gay,
Gay Man Golly.

04:34.357 --> 04:37.194
-Um... Kids can be cruel.
-Kids can be cruel.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.571
What with that,
and me only having one bollock,

04:39.654 --> 04:42.074
it's amazing
I made it through school at all.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.742
Luckily, I could do this.

04:48.997 --> 04:53.084
<i>Yeah, so I'm a mascot,</i>
<i>for Willingham Rovers,</i>

04:53.168 --> 04:55.879
<i>a non-league team in South Croydon.</i>

04:55.962 --> 04:59.841
Dad... Dad was Sid before me,
and his dad was Sid before him.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.010
-So, it's a bit of a family tradition.
-It's a family tradition.

05:02.094 --> 05:04.429
It's a bit of a legacy.
It's not what I dreamed of doing.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.764
Well, yeah, but your dad wouldn't
let you get away with not doing it.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.391
No. God, no.
He was insistent.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.478
Once his knees started going,
he was insistent that I took over.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.605
But I enjoy it. It's fine.
It's all a bit of banter.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.149
There's the standard,
"He runs, he kicks, he's got 100 pricks.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.775
Sid the Hedgehog,
Sid the Hedgehog."

05:17.860 --> 05:18.902
There's, um...

05:29.830 --> 05:32.958
Which is not factually correct,
'cause my mom didn't cut my bollock off.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.918
I lost it in a skateboarding accident.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.339
<i>I'm Cindi Babineaux.</i>

05:39.422 --> 05:43.135
I'm Alvin the Armadillo, or Armadilla,
depending on where you're from.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.469
You can say both.

05:44.553 --> 05:48.890
I studied music and dance therapy here
at the college,

05:48.974 --> 05:51.476
and I was a cheerleader
in high school, so, um...

05:51.559 --> 05:53.686
But studying dance was really, uh...

05:54.980 --> 05:56.064
was really fun.

05:56.148 --> 06:00.110
I love all kinds of dancing.
I can hip-hop. I can pop.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.825
See, this is Alvin right here.
I love him.

06:07.909 --> 06:11.329
I love, um... I love putting on the mask,

06:11.413 --> 06:12.789
<i>and, um...</i>

06:13.999 --> 06:15.500
<i>just being inside of him.</i>

06:15.583 --> 06:17.502
<i>It's like I can be...</i>

06:17.586 --> 06:22.424
<i>I can move any way I want,</i>
<i>and, um... I love it.</i>

06:25.719 --> 06:28.930
<i>It took me seven and a half years</i>
<i>to graduate, but I did.</i>

06:29.014 --> 06:34.186
And I lived and breathed
my mascot life, like, 25/8.

06:34.269 --> 06:37.605
<i>I loved it.</i>
<i>I've been doing it for a long time.</i>

06:39.274 --> 06:43.278
I went to the Fluffies five years ago,
and I got honorable mention.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.615
And that means I'm...

06:46.698 --> 06:51.911
That's like first place, really,
but it's a weird first place, and, uh...

06:52.996 --> 06:54.831
So, I'm gonna go back again, and...

06:59.044 --> 07:02.630
It could be my last time, you know?
This could be my last hurrah.

07:02.714 --> 07:03.798
Um...

07:05.842 --> 07:07.135
My swan song.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.687
<i>My name is Tommy,</i>
<i>also known as the Fist.</i>

07:18.438 --> 07:21.566
I am the official mascot
of the Blue Lake Mallards.

07:21.650 --> 07:25.195
<i>Lot of people say I'm the bad boy</i>
<i>of sports mascotry.</i>

07:25.278 --> 07:26.989
And to be fair, I am currently serving

07:27.072 --> 07:29.907
six temporary suspensions
from different stadiums

07:29.992 --> 07:32.910
for some physical incidents
that took place between myself

07:32.995 --> 07:35.372
and some opposing players
and team mascots.

07:37.082 --> 07:42.587
I'm also currently serving a lifetime ban
from the Calgary Cavaliers

07:43.296 --> 07:44.339
for a...

07:45.340 --> 07:46.758
sexual incident

07:46.841 --> 07:49.427
that took place between myself
and their team owner's wife.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.473
Hey! What is...

07:53.556 --> 07:54.641
What?

07:54.724 --> 07:57.727
-Hey! Hey, stop!
-Get off! What are you...

07:57.810 --> 07:59.812
-Hey, stop humping my wife!
-Get off me! Jesus!

08:03.316 --> 08:04.817
I'm originally from Ireland.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.319
My parents founded a...

08:07.570 --> 08:10.490
religious commune,
I suppose you'd call it.

08:11.408 --> 08:16.288
A spiritual community
called Highway to Heaven,

08:16.371 --> 08:17.414
<i>based on the spiritual teachings</i>

08:17.497 --> 08:20.542
<i>of Michael Landon</i>
<i>in the 1980s' TV program.</i>

08:20.625 --> 08:23.044
It was around that time
that I got into sports mascotry.

08:23.670 --> 08:28.258
I started as Kenny the Kangaroo
for a local high school football team.

08:29.384 --> 08:32.679
And the part of the act
that people really responded to

08:32.761 --> 08:35.347
was the fighting
that Kenny would get into at the end.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.474
And so, eventually,

08:36.558 --> 08:39.352
I just cut out the middleman
and went straight to the fist...

08:42.522 --> 08:45.692
which I think works well, artistically.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.945
<i>My name is Phil Mayhew.</i>

08:49.821 --> 08:52.615
<i>In my pretend life,</i>
<i>I am a real estate appraiser.</i>

08:52.699 --> 08:56.619
But in my real life,
I am Jack the Plumber...

08:56.703 --> 08:59.081
official mascot
for the Beaumont College football team.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.958
It is truly a dream come true for me.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.716
Looking good, boys.
Looking good!

09:10.883 --> 09:12.969
Kirby, what's up, bro?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.387
Hey.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.975
Boys are looking good. Clemence!

09:19.892 --> 09:21.603
Clemence!

09:28.985 --> 09:30.278
What have we got,
the Cougars on Saturday?

09:31.154 --> 09:33.323
That is a tough group of boys.
We beat 'em last time,

09:33.406 --> 09:37.119
but, uh... you always gotta
keep your wits about you, don't ya?

09:37.202 --> 09:38.328
Mm-hmm.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.872
-All right, guys. See you Saturday.
-Hey, come on, man.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.210
Who was that guy?

09:45.293 --> 09:49.881
<i>I think the mascot is as important</i>
<i>as any member of the team.</i>

09:49.964 --> 09:53.218
'Cause when things are going good,
it's easy, but when they're bad,

09:53.301 --> 09:57.514
that's when I come out of the tunnel
with a T-shirt cannon or a beach ball.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.432
And I'm doing a pratfall,

09:59.516 --> 10:01.184
or I'm, like, pretending
to grab the ref's butt

10:01.268 --> 10:03.060
and turning around and acting all coy.

10:03.145 --> 10:04.604
And that's when
the crowd is starting to laugh

10:04.687 --> 10:06.231
and they're starting to get enthusiastic.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.984
For me, it is that sound.
The sound of that crowd.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.572
You can't really hear it inside the head,
but you can hear that there is a sound.

10:15.573 --> 10:18.660
And for me, the sound of that sound...

10:19.661 --> 10:21.288
that is the greatest sound in the world.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.999
Well, this is my playground.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.168
Isn't this something?

10:26.251 --> 10:29.587
This right here is where
all the mascots are gonna be performing.

10:29.671 --> 10:32.549
We're gonna have a judges' table
set up right over that way.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.259
And then, of course,
the audience is over here.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.385
A thousand seats,

10:35.468 --> 10:38.054
and I wouldn't be the least bit surprised
if we sell out this year.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.139
Wow!

10:39.597 --> 10:40.932
Uh, how high is this ceiling?

10:41.015 --> 10:43.059
What do you think?
Just guesstimate?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.061
Don't know. I'm not in that business.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.271
Maybe 200 feet?

10:46.354 --> 10:48.398
I'm in the business
of "it needs to be higher," though.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.108
Hello, there. I'm Upton French.

10:50.192 --> 10:52.694
I'm the program manager
of the Gluten Free Channel,

10:52.777 --> 10:57.615
which is on your basic-tier cable package

10:57.699 --> 10:59.909
that runs in over two cities nationwide.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.494
Um...

11:01.578 --> 11:05.915
The channel's owned by Panorama Datacom,
and I've done a bunch of shows for them,

11:05.998 --> 11:09.336
starting with the sailing networks,
SN1 and 2.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.671
SN1 went under, as it were.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.591
You may remember,
it was a live television event.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.885
We did <i>Santa's Rocking Holiday Regatta,</i>

11:17.969 --> 11:20.513
and the boat carrying Santa Claus turtled,

11:20.597 --> 11:22.056
and Santa just went right down.

11:22.139 --> 11:23.850
He was gone,

11:23.933 --> 11:29.355
and we never really lived down the name
the Channel That Killed Santa Claus.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.692
But I licked my wounds.
I just kept going.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.570
FRC was next,
the Fence and Railing Channel.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.905
We did have
a very good-looking pole driver on there,

11:37.989 --> 11:42.619
a very messy personal life
and a terrible driving record,

11:42.702 --> 11:45.913
and then those things
generally play well with women.

11:45.997 --> 11:48.625
- We love the bad boys.
- Yeah, do you?

11:48.708 --> 11:51.294
- We love the bad boys.
- Isn't she funny?

11:52.211 --> 11:55.214
Anyway, on from there,
we went to the Varicose Vein Channel,

11:55.298 --> 11:58.259
which I had a big, uh...
a big success with.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.553
Pulled in some very big numbers
on a special I ran

12:00.637 --> 12:02.347
called <i>Do the Backs of My Legs</i>
<i>Look Like Waffles?</i>

12:02.430 --> 12:06.351
That brings me up to the day
that I met this one here.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.854
Well, I'm Jessica Mundt,

12:09.937 --> 12:12.940
and I'm a junior executive
at the Gluten Free Channel.

12:13.024 --> 12:16.736
And I am under this man's wing.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.029
He's showing me the ropes.

12:18.112 --> 12:21.032
I've never been out and about
like this before.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.241
In the field.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.827
So, I'm really
enjoying it quite a bit.

12:24.911 --> 12:28.373
Uh, this guy picked me up.
I was working at the Elevator Channel.

12:28.456 --> 12:32.752
Before that, I was a PA
on the hit show <i>Does That Smell Normal?</i>

12:44.722 --> 12:47.767
-Does this smell normal?
-I can't tell.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.270
Really,
everybody involved in that production

12:50.353 --> 12:53.648
caught my eye because
they pulled these incredible numbers out

12:53.731 --> 12:55.608
of this very difficult show.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.068
And particularly Jessica here.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.320
-"Lightning in a bottle" we called it.
-Yeah. There you go.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.076
Oh, that's it! Oh, that's it!

13:05.159 --> 13:07.454
Zook, let's go, man.
We gotta get going.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.539
Go away!

13:10.873 --> 13:12.291
We gotta hit the road, man.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.960
We gotta do 2,000 miles in three days.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.294
No, thank you!

13:15.378 --> 13:17.254
Okay, I'll drive the first shift. Sure.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.507
<i>I've been a bouncer</i>
<i>here at Bushwackers</i>

13:19.591 --> 13:21.258
<i>for about a little over two years.</i>

13:21.343 --> 13:24.554
Um, I actually met Zook first time...
Gosh.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.807
It would've been in my hometown.
It would've been in Medicine Hat, Alberta.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.435
And I was bouncing in a place
called the Cabbage Patch.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.729
And that was kind of a crazy meeting

13:32.812 --> 13:36.983
because he actually got into the club
dressed as the Fist,

13:37.066 --> 13:40.778
<i>and my manager was like, "Shut it down."</i>
<i>I was like, "What? This is too good."</i>

13:40.862 --> 13:44.115
So, they suspended him for a little while,
and he just came back, you know.

13:44.198 --> 13:48.786
He came to me and he said,
"I need a straight man for my act,"

13:48.870 --> 13:51.873
and I was like, "Right on, dude.
I'm straight and I party."

13:51.956 --> 13:55.377
And he goes, "Well, not like that.
You would be in my act as a straight man."

13:55.460 --> 13:57.378
He explained it to me
and I figured it out,

13:57.462 --> 13:59.797
and it's been unbelievable since.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.516
-Ah, got what you wanted?
-I got what I wanted.

14:09.599 --> 14:10.808
- What did you want?
- Cod and chips.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.435
-Did you get it? Good.
-I got cod and chips.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.561
-Hmm. Nice!
-Look at that.

14:13.645 --> 14:16.481
Willingham Rovers has been
sort of part of my whole life.

14:16.564 --> 14:20.485
I pretty much grew up at Peacedale Park.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.112
I was probably this high,
you know...

14:23.196 --> 14:25.823
...just a nipper when I first went
to the ground.

14:25.907 --> 14:29.660
I used to stand at the Flange Road end
behind the goal,

14:29.744 --> 14:32.789
and, uh...
it grew from there, really.

14:32.872 --> 14:37.210
And then, when I was 16,
on my 16th birthday, I got this.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.295
The uh...
you know, the club tattoo.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.507
There's a factory here,
and then there's two spoons.

14:42.590 --> 14:47.428
And in 1905, the club was formed
by the workers at the pudding factory.

14:47.512 --> 14:50.139
<i>And they decided</i>
<i>they wanted to have a mascot.</i>

14:50.723 --> 14:53.393
So they had... I think they
had trials that next week,

14:53.476 --> 14:55.520
and my father, um...

14:55.603 --> 14:59.607
Owen Golly Sr. Sr.,
got chosen to be Sid the Hedgehog,

14:59.691 --> 15:03.945
and that began
what is really a family dynasty now.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.905
All right, guys,
we've got to go, go, go, go, go.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.073
- You got my bag?
- We're running late.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.658
-I got it.
-Don't worry. He's got everything.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.702
All right, Monty,
we need to step on it, buddy.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.620
Hon, it's fine.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.832
- Okay, we are late.
- We're really not that late.

15:15.915 --> 15:19.210
Okay, yeah, but I always get chosen
for a TSA pat-down,

15:19.293 --> 15:21.879
-so we need to...
-Well, you're very tall. It's obnoxious.

15:22.797 --> 15:25.258
You fit the lone-shooter profile,
I think.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.009
-Okay. You know what?
-Will you be careful with these?

15:27.093 --> 15:29.178
What did Dr. Ezefee say
about hate speech?

15:35.477 --> 15:36.728
Uh...

15:38.605 --> 15:40.147
Oh.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.317
-It hasn't always been easy.
-Yeah.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.404
You know, like any couple,
we have our ups and downs.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.948
Which is normal.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.117
Right.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.370
And, uh, I think what...

15:54.454 --> 15:58.374
sort of the watchword is
with us is "commitment."

16:00.042 --> 16:01.085
We're committed.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.296
Well, he slept with someone.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.383
So... probably mention that.

16:09.761 --> 16:12.179
-Cindi Babineaux.
-Yeah, Cindi Babineaux.

16:12.263 --> 16:15.517
Five years ago at a mascot competition.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.105
Can I help who's next?

16:21.188 --> 16:23.357
-Remember that?
-And I would take the...

16:23.440 --> 16:26.402
- Ladies? Ladies? Can I help you?
- Hey.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.737
-Yes.
-Yeah.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.031
Identification, please.
Hi, there.

16:30.114 --> 16:33.367
When we were in high school,
I got a note.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.495
Laci passed me a note in class.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.204
-Yeah.
-In history class.

16:37.288 --> 16:40.791
And it said, "I'm your sister."

16:41.709 --> 16:45.171
And I was like,
"Yeah, I'm your sister. I love you."

16:45.254 --> 16:47.340
We go to the same church,
so I thought it was...

16:47.423 --> 16:48.925
-it was sister talk.
-Like sisters in Christ.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.092
Yeah.

16:50.176 --> 16:54.222
And she wrote me another note
and passed it.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.682
It was one of them football notes.

16:56.724 --> 17:02.230
And, um... it said,
"No, you're really my sister.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.608
-We have the same daddy."
-We do.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.027
Our chemicals are the same.

17:08.109 --> 17:10.029
-Half of 'em.
-Half of 'em.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.615
So, apparently,

17:12.699 --> 17:16.828
and I found out when I was 16 that
my mother, who lives in Electric Mills,

17:16.911 --> 17:19.496
had an affair with her daddy,
who runs a filling station.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.708
And then, we have the same birthday.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.584
-Yeah.
-So that was the weird thing

17:23.667 --> 17:26.127
-which made it even more personal.
-You know, when it rains...

17:26.212 --> 17:27.253
-It pours.
-Right.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.465
- Yeah.
- It does. Well...

17:29.549 --> 17:31.258
Because, later on that year...

17:32.301 --> 17:33.344
Yeah.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.512
-You had your accident.
-I had an accident.

17:35.597 --> 17:39.516
Um, I had a little dream in my heart of...

17:41.561 --> 17:43.354
going to college
on a cheerleading scholarship.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.189
Oh, baby.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.733
And I fell.

17:48.526 --> 17:52.572
And she was so good. She was...
You were so good.

17:52.655 --> 17:56.242
And I sprained my ankle,
and I had to hobble.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.703
And then, you couldn't do the pageants.
So, that was...

17:58.786 --> 18:00.872
Right. It kind of just wiped me out.

18:00.955 --> 18:03.124
It wiped me out of pep rallies
and homecoming

18:03.207 --> 18:06.043
and cheerleading,
and scholarship, and, um...

18:08.087 --> 18:10.590
It took away a lot of purpose from me.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.885
-But then you had your kids.
-Yes.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.096
Yes, thank you for reminding me.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.515
I have Ruby and Jamaica.

18:20.432 --> 18:21.601
And, um...

18:22.727 --> 18:27.064
They're 24 and 22 now,
so they're big. They're big girls.

18:27.148 --> 18:30.067
And Ruby has a little one. Ruby Jr.

18:30.151 --> 18:32.987
- She's a grandma.
- So she's a... I am.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.614
She's a granny!

18:36.699 --> 18:38.743
<i>I'm excited to get down</i>
<i>to Anaheim because</i>

18:38.826 --> 18:40.286
<i>I'm gonna be around like-minded people.</i>

18:40.369 --> 18:41.996
'Cause, for the most part,

18:42.079 --> 18:46.458
all of us are going down there
because we have a passion for this craft.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.878
Um...

18:48.961 --> 18:52.339
There's also another reason
that I am excited about going down there,

18:52.423 --> 18:58.387
and... full disclosure, I reconnected
with an old classmate on Facebook.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.641
Robin Wexler, the hottest girl
at Higbee High School.

19:02.934 --> 19:06.478
But yeah, she wound up marrying
Steve Nunan, captain of the soccer team,

19:06.562 --> 19:08.230
for which I was the mascot.

19:08.314 --> 19:11.108
And now she is divorced,

19:11.192 --> 19:13.110
and her grown son has moved out
of the house,

19:13.194 --> 19:14.904
and she's living
in Orange County, California.

19:14.987 --> 19:19.241
So... spoiler alert, we really hit it off
on Facebook Messenger.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.161
And I have volunteered to perform

19:22.244 --> 19:25.622
at a charity event that she's organizing
for a group of disadvantaged children.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.625
So, I'm excited to get down there.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.803
-Hello, there.
-Oh, hello. Welcome, sir.

19:38.886 --> 19:44.141
Blumquist, AJ. They should have
the John Wayne suite ready.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.603
Okay, we actually have you
for the Slim Pickens suite.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.023
I don't think so.
I think I'm in the John Wayne suite.

19:51.107 --> 19:53.150
I made a reservation.
I got a confirmation number right here.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.610
-Okay. Yeah, let me take a look at that.
-Sure.

19:57.154 --> 20:00.032
No, sir, you're actually
in the Slim Pickens suite.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.034
-Huh. Gabby.
-Let me go ahead and get your card.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.412
-How you doing?
-Hey, you... AJ.

20:04.495 --> 20:07.539
You think that name would be
on the tip of my tongue. I'm sorry.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.334
After all this time. Uh...

20:10.417 --> 20:12.920
I'm Gabby Monkhouse.
I'm in the John Wayne suite.

20:13.004 --> 20:14.046
Oh, all right.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.214
-One minute, Miss Monkhouse.
-All right.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.883
Let me just...

20:16.966 --> 20:19.343
I don't think it's overstating anything

20:19.427 --> 20:25.224
to say that I was the first female
to bring notoriety to our field

20:25.307 --> 20:26.558
as Minnie the Moose,

20:26.642 --> 20:30.146
the Vernon Community College
baseball team's mascot.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.232
I once held the splits

20:33.315 --> 20:37.069
<i>for the entire length</i>
<i>of an extra inning baseball game</i>

20:37.153 --> 20:38.780
<i>in spite of excruciating pain...</i>

20:39.530 --> 20:44.702
and a severe severing
of my adductor longus muscle

20:44.785 --> 20:47.288
that eventually required four hours
of surgery

20:47.371 --> 20:51.458
and added two and a half inches
to my left leg, forcing me to retire.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.002
And I...

20:54.461 --> 20:58.424
I wrote a tale...
documenting that journey.

20:58.507 --> 21:05.014
<i>A-Moosing Grace. A Mascot's Journey to God</i>
<i>...and Success in Real Estate.</i>

21:11.145 --> 21:15.441
Well, my name is AJ Blumquist,
and I'm a former mascot, Danny the Donkey.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.110
And I'm a judge this year
for the Fluffies.

21:18.194 --> 21:23.866
For the two people that don't know,
Danny the Donkey, my mascot, alter ego,

21:23.950 --> 21:26.911
was the first one to have
an anatomically correct costume.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.915
<i>That lasted all of one game.</i>
<i>Caused a lot of controversy.</i>

21:30.998 --> 21:34.626
But I have a lot of fans in Mexico,
south of the border,

21:34.710 --> 21:37.254
Tasmania, Finland.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.131
And I've had a lot of personal growth.

21:39.215 --> 21:44.095
I see my role in the controversy
that was involved in that.

21:44.178 --> 21:47.974
Not just the costume that I designed
and went out one day onto the field with,

21:48.057 --> 21:51.310
but, you know, the muscle cars
and the large cigars.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.563
You know, I was overcompensating.
Classic overcompensation.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.566
But with support groups,
I've made a lot of progress.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.027
And, you know, I-I...

22:00.111 --> 22:02.321
I stay away from medical terms
like micropenis.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.156
I'm phallically challenged...

22:04.240 --> 22:07.576
and you know,
some of the great groups that I rely on

22:07.660 --> 22:10.621
are Tom Thumb and Tiny Tim
and Pinky Promise,

22:10.704 --> 22:12.498
that have helped me accept
who I am as a man.

22:13.582 --> 22:18.087
And right now,
cochlear sex is really trending very hot.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.546
You wanna just put in, "hashtag..."

22:19.630 --> 22:22.591
In any of your social media,
"Hashtag, in your ear,"

22:22.674 --> 22:24.301
and you'll see what's going on.

22:24.385 --> 22:26.512
You have to be very careful
how you spell that, though.

22:26.595 --> 22:29.390
So, make sure you spell it or say it,
"In your ear."

22:29.473 --> 22:32.726
Otherwise, you know, people think
you're talking about something else.

22:34.603 --> 22:35.646
Have a good night.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.731
<i>We're two days away</i>
<i>from the competition,</i>

22:37.814 --> 22:39.316
<i>and I hope you're proud of yourselves</i>

22:39.400 --> 22:41.027
because, literally,

22:41.110 --> 22:44.280
hundreds of mascots wanted
to compete in this year's competition.

22:44.363 --> 22:48.492
And the judges and I went through all
the applications and the audition tapes,

22:48.575 --> 22:50.494
and we even had to hire translators

22:50.577 --> 22:53.039
because there are some
kind of weird languages out there.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.748
And believe me, it wasn't cheap.

22:54.831 --> 22:58.627
And we finally narrowed it down
to 20 finalists.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.171
That's you people.

23:00.254 --> 23:02.798
Give yourselves a round of applause.

23:05.842 --> 23:08.720
I can see some of you out there
sizing up the competition,

23:08.804 --> 23:11.348
looking at 'em and thinking,
"That's my arch enemy."

23:11.432 --> 23:13.267
Well, not tonight.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.686
Tonight, we are all friends.

23:15.769 --> 23:16.979
In fact, could you all just take a moment

23:17.063 --> 23:20.149
and say hello and meet-and-greet somebody
maybe you've never met before?

23:20.232 --> 23:23.027
It's what we always do at church.
Isn't that fun?

23:23.110 --> 23:25.321
Great.
God bless each and every one of you.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.698
Hey, let's have a party!

23:31.702 --> 23:33.162
- Hey, how's it going?
- Good evening.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.706
Tommy Zucarello, plus one.

23:35.789 --> 23:38.625
Uh, yeah. Tommy's in there,
but there's no plus one.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.461
There should be. Um...

23:41.753 --> 23:44.340
What about the Fist?
Is there the Fist plus one?

23:44.423 --> 23:47.176
-Uh, the Fist?
-Yeah.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.510
No plus one.

24:05.611 --> 24:06.862
No? Really?

24:06.945 --> 24:08.322
Sorry, yeah.
It's not on the list.

24:08.405 --> 24:11.242
Oh, you know what? He probably
did a nickname thing, "Dibs." D-I-B-S.

24:11.325 --> 24:12.701
-Okay. I'll check.
-Yeah, I'm sure it's there.

24:12.785 --> 24:13.827
-I'm sure it's there.
-Mm-hmm.

24:13.910 --> 24:15.162
Is that a margarita machine?

24:17.539 --> 24:20.209
That vanilla wrap is such a must-have.
I love it.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.753
-It's a vanilla wrap?
-It's called a vanilla wrap.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.171
-Oh, I've never heard that term.
-Mm-hmm.

24:24.255 --> 24:25.672
-All right, strawberry as requested.
-Oh, thank you.

24:32.929 --> 24:35.307
-I'm Mindy.
-Hi, Mindy. I'm Cindi.

24:35.391 --> 24:36.684
-Mike Murray.
-Hi, I'm Laci.

24:36.767 --> 24:37.851
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Good to see you. Hi.

24:37.935 --> 24:39.812
-You're a Babineaux?
-Yes.

24:39.895 --> 24:40.980
Okay.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.483
-Are you feeling okay?
-Yeah. Yeah, I feel great...

24:44.566 --> 24:46.277
Mike has IBS, so it's tough.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.403
Ouch!

24:47.486 --> 24:50.197
You know, you're having a great time,
and then...

24:52.033 --> 24:54.618
Well, I've had three yeast infections
since my divorce.

24:56.412 --> 24:58.580
I just wanna stick a hairbrush down there
and get it out.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.917
<i>This is our vendors' area.</i>

25:02.000 --> 25:05.546
<i>We have 24 booths in all.</i>
<i>Three more than last year.</i>

25:05.629 --> 25:08.215
<i>And this is, by far,</i>
<i>the best turnout we have ever had.</i>

25:08.299 --> 25:09.466
<i>I don't know if you can smell it,</i>

25:09.550 --> 25:12.094
but the popcorn
is really, really going on strong,

25:12.178 --> 25:14.138
which means people
are staying and buying things.

25:14.221 --> 25:15.556
That's 'cause you're
probably smelling mine.

25:15.639 --> 25:18.684
-It's right here.
-Oh. You're right.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.352
But I also think
it's from other people, too.

25:20.436 --> 25:21.478
It might just be hers.

25:21.562 --> 25:22.646
-I think it's this.
-It could be.

25:22.729 --> 25:24.565
- Hi. What's your name?
- Hi. Tommy.

25:24.648 --> 25:27.526
-Tommy, this has been a delight.
-Oh, well, thank you so much.

25:27.609 --> 25:28.777
-You bet, darling.
-Take care.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.362
God bless, sweetheart.

25:32.156 --> 25:33.198
AJ.

25:33.282 --> 25:36.535
You know, I could nudge some
of my people towards you.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.079
They might enjoy meeting you...

25:38.162 --> 25:39.538
even if they don't know who you are.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.081
-No, no. I'm fine. I got a whole...
-You good?

25:41.165 --> 25:42.458
There's a busload of people coming.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.376
-Is that right?
-They must be a little bit late.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.669
-I better call 'em.
-Yeah.

25:45.752 --> 25:48.297
-Hi! What's your name?
-Hi. Lindsay.

25:55.679 --> 25:58.223
Have you ever spent
any time inside a mascot outfit?

25:58.307 --> 25:59.516
No, I never have.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.018
It's like, you know, walking around
with a porta-potty.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.604
Porta-potties, I've been in. Many of them.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.314
Then you know what that smells like.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.398
Ooh.

26:06.482 --> 26:09.818
-Let me share with you what I do.
-Oh, wow, please. Okay, I'm all ears.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.695
I'm an aromatic engineer.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.322
-Kind of an inventor.
-Right.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.199
-So, I'm gonna show you...
-Yeah, please.

26:15.282 --> 26:19.786
I've come up with what I like to call
the scented cup.

26:21.455 --> 26:23.290
I've got bruschetta.

26:23.374 --> 26:25.000
-Bruschetta? Are you serious?
-Oh, yeah.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.128
And then we have anchovy.

26:27.211 --> 26:30.631
People from the northwest
are going crazy for this, this anchovy.

26:30.714 --> 26:31.840
Oh, very interesting ones.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.342
-Yeah, no...
-Anchovy and bruschetta.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.926
You know, "Where's dinner?"
"Down here."

26:35.010 --> 26:37.096
I can't tell you how excited I am
to be here.

26:37.179 --> 26:40.641
You know,
I first fell in love with mascotting

26:40.724 --> 26:43.144
when my second wife,
Lordes, and I,

26:43.227 --> 26:47.272
we took our kids,
Muffy, Ponce, Sugito and um...

26:47.356 --> 26:48.774
Oh, boy, what's her name?

26:48.857 --> 26:50.066
She's always running around,

26:50.151 --> 26:53.529
hiding under coffee tables
and behind sofas.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.239
Never comes out in the day... Maria.

26:55.322 --> 26:56.615
Took 'em to a ball game.

26:56.698 --> 26:59.618
And so, I found,
as the game progressed, that...

26:59.701 --> 27:02.538
Well, they were watching the mascots
more than they were watching the game.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.039
And I popped a lot of money
for those tickets,

27:04.123 --> 27:06.834
so, you know, that got me interested
in mascotting.

27:06.917 --> 27:09.211
And I go home,
and I start researching a little bit,

27:09.295 --> 27:10.337
and it's fascinating

27:10.420 --> 27:14.383
because so many people think
mascotting's been around for 200 years.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.385
Wrong. So wrong.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.929
I mean, you can go back to like 1500 BC.

27:19.012 --> 27:21.973
<i>The Egyptians, you know, they only paint</i>
<i>with everybody looking to the left.</i>

27:22.057 --> 27:25.436
You ever noticed that?
Life is one big left turn to these people.

27:25.519 --> 27:29.190
If I lived then, I'd be on the right,
be something different, be fun, go nuts.

27:29.273 --> 27:30.857
But I didn't live then, sadly enough.

27:48.292 --> 27:49.585
Mr. Gammons, sir.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.753
-Sorry I'm late.
-Oh, hi, Phil.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.589
Yeah, I had a bit of a mesh tear
inside the helmet.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.757
I had to find some electrical tape,
but we're all good.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.718
Dogs are funny, aren't they?

27:58.677 --> 27:59.678
You like dogs?

27:59.761 --> 28:00.887
I like 'em, yeah.

28:00.971 --> 28:03.307
-Hey, you put on some weight?
-Well...

28:03.390 --> 28:04.891
I like the outfit.

28:04.975 --> 28:07.102
I've weighed 161 pounds
since 11th grade.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.897
What have you got planned here?
I've been thinking about this act.

28:09.980 --> 28:13.191
Um, well, you know, there's gonna be...
The toilet is up here.

28:13.275 --> 28:14.485
-Center stage, in the back there.
-All right.

28:14.568 --> 28:17.738
I'm gonna enter from over here.
Got my bag of... bag of tricks.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.406
-Yeah.
-So, music starts.

28:19.490 --> 28:20.907
I give it a beat or two.

28:20.991 --> 28:24.077
Jack the Plumber enters,
and he's kind of big and looking around,

28:24.160 --> 28:25.579
you know, "What's this? What's..."

28:25.662 --> 28:27.789
I'm gonna drop my stuff,
my gear, there.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.958
And that's when I clock the audience,

28:30.041 --> 28:33.545
and then it's like,
"Come on, let's go. Let's go."

28:33.629 --> 28:35.213
All the way across the front there.

28:35.297 --> 28:39.551
Then I give 'em a little,
"I can't hear you. I can't hear you."

28:39.635 --> 28:42.596
All right, let me stop you right there.
Why can't you hear them?

28:45.140 --> 28:47.976
-I can't hear them...
-So, I like all this up to a point.

28:48.059 --> 28:50.354
-Okay.
-But nevertheless, as a plumber,

28:50.437 --> 28:52.731
you're gonna be very concerned
about your job.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.275
-I'm sorry to interrupt you there...
-No,

28:54.358 --> 28:55.567
that's when I'm gonna take
a bit of a break

28:55.651 --> 28:56.652
'cause I'm gonna dance.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.654
That's why I've been working
really hard on the...

28:59.655 --> 29:01.072
And if you throw a little twist in,

29:01.156 --> 29:03.534
the white-haired crowd
is gonna go mad, right?

29:03.617 --> 29:05.494
Yeah. It's fun. It's generational.

29:05.577 --> 29:10.123
But I'd like another button on there.
Something that's a little more satisfying.

29:10.207 --> 29:12.542
And I think we can do it.
We'll put our heads together.

29:12.626 --> 29:15.170
And plus, there's gonna be
some plumbers in the audience.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.338
They're gonna be your toughest critics.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.632
And they're gonna say,
"Hey, a plumber wouldn't do that."

29:18.715 --> 29:20.717
So, you'll fool 'em
and show 'em the right moves.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.105
Punt.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.287
The ladder comes down from...

29:48.370 --> 29:49.663
Whoa! Hold on, hold on.
What are you doing?

29:49.746 --> 29:52.333
I'm gonna do the ladder routine
that I've been working on.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.667
Come on now. We talked about this.

29:53.750 --> 29:56.169
I know we talked about it.
We've talked about it a lot.

29:56.252 --> 29:58.213
But I really think now is the moment

29:58.297 --> 30:00.466
for me to finish
with the big ladder routine.

30:00.549 --> 30:01.758
Now, because there's a ladder here...

30:01.842 --> 30:04.260
No, Dad, there wasn't just a ladder there.
I bought that ladder.

30:04.345 --> 30:06.430
- You bought it? When?
- Yeah, I bought it yesterday.

30:06.513 --> 30:09.265
I've been working on this routine
for months, Dad, and it's good.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.476
-You didn't tell me about it.
-I have told you.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.687
I've told you time and time again
about the ladder routine,

30:13.770 --> 30:14.980
and you keep knocking it down.

30:15.063 --> 30:18.525
I've seen the Americans' acts.
They're bigger. They've got big finishes.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.777
They've got fireworks
and pyros and dancing girls.

30:20.861 --> 30:23.322
-So we have to become American now?
-No, we're not coming...

30:23.405 --> 30:25.032
We've got a beautiful routine.
It's lovely.

30:25.115 --> 30:28.410
What we've got
is a British act that has tradition.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.120
-I know.
-Tradition is good!

30:30.203 --> 30:31.372
Our tradition is great.

30:31.455 --> 30:34.500
Do you wanna piss on tradition?
Do you? Go to Her Majesty.

30:34.583 --> 30:38.211
"Ma'am, why don't you go out next time
without your crown and scepter,

30:38.294 --> 30:39.338
and wear a fez?"

30:39.421 --> 30:42.007
Oh, yeah. "And carry a selfie stick.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.801
And while you're at it,
have Philip bring along a ladder."

30:45.511 --> 30:46.845
That's not what he's saying,
though, is it?

30:46.928 --> 30:48.096
You're not listening to him.

30:48.179 --> 30:50.056
-It is what he's saying.
-No, he's not.

30:50.140 --> 30:51.391
He's just... If you listen...

30:51.475 --> 30:53.059
Oh, now, I'm not a good listener?

30:53.143 --> 30:54.185
No, you're not a brilliant listener.

30:54.269 --> 30:55.979
You don't tell him
how good he is often enough.

30:56.062 --> 30:57.898
I'm always telling him how good he is!

30:57.981 --> 30:59.900
Are you? Do you? I mean...

30:59.983 --> 31:01.026
-Yes!
-When?

31:01.109 --> 31:02.736
Well, maybe not in words.

31:02.819 --> 31:04.530
But I love him!

31:04.613 --> 31:05.947
I love him like a son.

31:06.740 --> 31:07.949
He is your son.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.618
Well, I know, but that's why I love him.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.579
Well, you don't tell him.
And words are useful, aren't they?

31:12.663 --> 31:14.330
Well done.
You should be a therapist, you should be.

31:14.415 --> 31:15.457
Okay, right.

31:15.540 --> 31:19.419
Well, all I'm saying is, sometimes,
you need to listen to other people.

31:19.503 --> 31:20.837
All right, well, I'm listening to you now.

31:20.921 --> 31:24.257
You take a few minutes,
play around with the ladder,

31:24.340 --> 31:27.553
do what you wanna do,
then take it back and get your money back.

31:27.636 --> 31:28.679
And I hope you've got the receipt,

31:28.762 --> 31:30.847
'cause then you can get the tax back
at the airport.

31:30.931 --> 31:33.934
So, have fun. I'm gonna have a cup of tea.
I'll see you in a while.

31:34.643 --> 31:37.312
And I'll find a Jaffa Cake
and all if I can.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.022
Behind the kettle, Dad.

31:39.105 --> 31:40.148
<i>Buddy.</i>

31:40.231 --> 31:42.150
-Oh, hey, Langston.
-Oh, we have got a problem.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.860
-We got a big problem.
-Why? What? Why? What is it?

31:43.944 --> 31:45.821
Benny the Banana Slug
failed his drug test.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.490
-What? Why?
-Yeah, he's on ecstasy.

31:48.574 --> 31:51.367
Apparently because he needs it
to do a pogo stick routine.

31:51.452 --> 31:53.912
I don't know, but I found him
licking his lips and saying,

31:53.995 --> 31:56.498
"Life is good. Life is good."
He just wouldn't shut up about it.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.374
Well, you know what?

31:58.459 --> 32:00.293
The Gluten Free Channel
can't find out about this.

32:00.376 --> 32:02.087
-No, I know they can't find out about it.
-That'd be awful.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.964
-That's the whole problem.
-What is it? What's happening?

32:04.047 --> 32:07.050
Nothing. It's just... I think a furry
snuck in, and he's scritching.

32:07.133 --> 32:08.677
-What's a furry?
-It's not a big deal.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.136
-What's a furry?
-A furry is simply

32:10.220 --> 32:13.348
just someone who likes to dress up
like an animal with human characteristics.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.058
It's a form of roleplay. It's huge.

32:15.141 --> 32:16.184
-Yeah, that's great.
-Yeah.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.103
But then, the scritching thing you said,
what is that?

32:18.186 --> 32:20.439
Scritching is simply
light scratching or grooming.

32:20.522 --> 32:22.899
It's a form of affection.
Furries love to do it.

32:22.983 --> 32:23.984
-I do that.
-It's fun for them.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.444
-Yeah. Sure.
-Exactly. We all do it.

32:25.527 --> 32:26.653
There was a bit of a thing in your voice.

32:26.736 --> 32:29.072
I'm good at hearing things in voices,
and you had a thing with the scritching.

32:29.156 --> 32:31.992
-What is it? Tell me.
-It has absolutely nothing to do with sex.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.118
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

32:33.201 --> 32:36.663
Only... Well, 37% of them
apparently enjoy sex very much,

32:36.747 --> 32:37.789
but that's not the point.

32:37.873 --> 32:41.710
I was in the other room,
and one of them kind of bumped into me.

32:41.793 --> 32:44.546
I thought the guy was going for my wallet,
so I turned around real quick.

32:44.630 --> 32:45.797
Uh...

32:45.881 --> 32:47.423
It seemed different. The...

32:47.508 --> 32:48.675
Did he yip or did he yiff?

32:49.259 --> 32:51.428
He said, "Skip," and I said,
"No, my name's Buddy."

32:51.512 --> 32:54.055
Okay, he yipped.
If he yipped, that means "hello."

32:54.139 --> 32:57.100
If he yiffs... If that happens,
well, then you got a problem.

32:57.183 --> 32:58.477
Yeah, you know what?
Might have been a yiff.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.562
Might have been "yiff."
And I said he was going for the wallet.

33:00.645 --> 33:03.273
More like he was going for loose change,
if you know what I'm saying. All right?

33:03.356 --> 33:04.941
Well, if it happens again, just go...

33:05.025 --> 33:06.442
I'm gonna say,
"Pal, you're gonna get this."

33:06.527 --> 33:08.779
We have bigger fish to fry.
We have a drug problem.

33:08.862 --> 33:09.905
And we got a sex problem

33:09.988 --> 33:12.532
if you got people yipping and yiffing
and skipping and all that stuff.

33:20.456 --> 33:21.457
Hello!

33:22.751 --> 33:23.919
-Corky!
-Hi, Cindi.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.170
-How are you?
-Oh, it's so good to see you.

33:25.253 --> 33:28.173
-Come here, you look so beautiful. Oh!
-Oh, so do you. Oh!

33:28.256 --> 33:29.883
It is so good to see you.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.134
And you too.

33:31.217 --> 33:32.260
Oh, I've missed you.

33:32.343 --> 33:34.220
I missed you, too. Mmm.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.598
-How was your flight?
-It was a little bumpy, you know.

33:36.682 --> 33:40.519
It was one of those small commuter planes,
and I kind of...

33:40.602 --> 33:42.353
little bit on my blouse.

33:42.437 --> 33:45.356
I had to wash it away
with a little moist towelette,

33:45.440 --> 33:46.608
which was fun.

33:46.692 --> 33:49.277
Well, you look great.
I don't see anything on your shirt.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.572
-Thank you.
-I need you.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.031
I need you.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.951
You have this fairy dust that just...
It just helps me.

33:56.034 --> 33:59.329
You are my favorite student ever
in the whole world.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.622
You're my favorite teacher.

34:00.706 --> 34:01.957
-You know that.
-Thank you.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.166
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

34:03.249 --> 34:04.710
Knock, knock, knock. Hello.

34:04.793 --> 34:06.502
-Hello.
-Hi! I'm Laci.

34:06.587 --> 34:07.671
-What's your name?
-Laci.

34:07.754 --> 34:10.549
Laci. Oh, you are beautiful.

34:10.632 --> 34:11.925
Oh, thank you.

34:12.007 --> 34:13.509
-May I?
-Okay.

34:13.592 --> 34:15.011
Mm-hmm.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.179
Oh!

34:16.262 --> 34:19.014
Yes. Boner!

34:19.099 --> 34:21.351
-Really?
-Definitely, yes.

34:21.434 --> 34:23.562
- Let me check.
- Oh.

34:24.938 --> 34:26.648
We're gonna talk for a little bit, okay?

34:26.732 --> 34:30.068
About some of the prep,
that I call it, for the show.

34:30.150 --> 34:33.404
And I know that you have
the... whole physical thing going.

34:33.487 --> 34:36.491
-I do.
-I wanna get inside that noodle.

34:36.574 --> 34:42.288
Her inner soul, heart, mind,
all the nerves, that whole world.

34:42.371 --> 34:45.166
-But we'll talk about it together, okay?
-Yeah.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.335
We'll probably see you
later then, I guess.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.920
-Okay. All right. Bye.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

34:50.005 --> 34:51.047
-Bye.
-Okay.

34:51.130 --> 34:53.091
<i>Nature is the great teacher,</i>

34:53.174 --> 34:57.178
and this exercise that I'm gonna teach you

34:57.262 --> 35:00.515
is nature personified, okay?

35:01.224 --> 35:04.019
I call this the crabby walk, okay?

35:04.102 --> 35:06.521
So, you say, "Crabby walk,"
and crabby walk...

35:06.605 --> 35:08.440
-Oh, okay.
-is...

35:08.523 --> 35:10.108
And I'm not saying crabs walk like that,

35:10.191 --> 35:13.111
'cause, obviously,
they don't have legs or big pants.

35:13.194 --> 35:16.781
But crabby walk gets you
in a frame of mind of...

35:16.865 --> 35:19.868
Yeah. That's crabby walk.
And you have to say it at the same time.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.452
Okay. Crabby walk.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.872
Right... but look up.
Don't be afraid of looking up.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.415
<i>There's something about</i>
<i>being in nature.</i>

35:25.498 --> 35:31.797
There's something about being in the wild
that always connected me to the world.

35:31.880 --> 35:37.052
Hanging from a cliff, you know,
from a technical climb,

35:37.135 --> 35:40.764
or... or having crampons on,
which I like to do anyway.

35:40.847 --> 35:44.017
But having crampons
on a glacier with an ice ax

35:44.100 --> 35:48.021
and making my way, you know,
into a crevasse. You know, rappelling.

35:48.104 --> 35:51.441
I love rappelling
because I love holding rope.

35:51.524 --> 35:54.569
Again, in any situation.

35:54.653 --> 35:57.364
But especially on the side of a mountain,
where you feel...

35:57.447 --> 36:02.077
It's like nature saying, with a big hand,
slapping you across the face and saying,

36:02.160 --> 36:05.872
"Listen. I'm here and so are you,

36:05.956 --> 36:09.876
but in one second,
you're not here and I'm still here."

36:09.960 --> 36:13.546
Which is pretty much
the best acting advice you could have.

36:14.422 --> 36:15.590
-Keep your head low...
-Yeah, yeah.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.383
-...so that Tammy's eyes are looking up.
-I know.

36:17.467 --> 36:18.760
-Okay.
-I know how it works. Go ahead.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.095
Okay. All right.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.681
Oh, sorry. That was my fault.

36:22.764 --> 36:24.057
-Okay.
-It was a little high, though.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.641
Right, but I think, at this point,

36:25.726 --> 36:27.518
what's less important
is whether or not you hit it,

36:27.602 --> 36:28.603
more just where your eyes end up

36:28.687 --> 36:29.688
because that's what
people'd be looking at.

36:29.771 --> 36:30.772
Well, I'm not wearing a head,

36:30.856 --> 36:32.148
so how can you tell where
my eyes are gonna end up?

36:32.232 --> 36:33.274
-Because...
-That was perfect, by the way.

36:33.358 --> 36:36.027
Because it correlates
with where your head is.

36:36.111 --> 36:38.822
I thought we were practicing this...
this part.

36:38.905 --> 36:40.156
You're being impossible.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.617
- Would you throw the ball?
- Yeah, I'll throw it.

36:42.701 --> 36:43.744
But we're not on a team anymore?

36:43.827 --> 36:45.245
-We're just two individuals?
-Throw the ball. What?

36:45.328 --> 36:47.122
Okay, well, that was too...

36:47.205 --> 36:49.165
-That came so close to my head!
-Okay.

36:49.249 --> 36:50.291
You piece of garbage!

36:50.375 --> 36:51.417
-Don't touch me!
-Why do you do that?

36:51.501 --> 36:52.543
-You know what?
-Why do you do that?

36:52.627 --> 36:54.838
You're at the wrong event!
You don't belong at the Fluffies!

36:54.921 --> 36:56.923
-At the angry music club?
-You belong at the Succubus Olympics!

36:57.006 --> 36:58.883
-Hi.
-That's what you should...

36:58.967 --> 37:00.635
Hi!

37:00.719 --> 37:02.553
- Oh, my God! Hi!
- You guys are here.

37:02.637 --> 37:03.930
You snuck up on us.

37:04.014 --> 37:05.056
Mr. Lumpkin.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.599
-Oh, you look beautiful!
-Thank you.

37:06.683 --> 37:08.893
-I'm sorry for my... I don't know what I...
-That's all right.

37:08.977 --> 37:10.020
-We're just rehearsing.
-That's all right.

37:10.103 --> 37:11.146
-You look... Hello!
-Look at you.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.564
-Hi, how are you? How are you?
-Hello.

37:13.648 --> 37:14.775
Look at you.
You look like a sunrise.

37:14.858 --> 37:16.109
- It's great to see you.
- I'm okay.

37:16.192 --> 37:17.235
<i>I'm a lucky guy.</i>

37:17.318 --> 37:19.362
Yeah, I'm just...

37:19.445 --> 37:22.448
Well, I was gonna say
I don't know how it happened,

37:22.532 --> 37:26.202
but I know exactly how it happened,
and, uh...

37:26.286 --> 37:27.495
I was online one day.

37:27.579 --> 37:30.749
I was kind of browsing
around escort services,

37:31.374 --> 37:35.420
and this face stared at me.

37:35.503 --> 37:36.755
And I just...

37:36.838 --> 37:40.967
I mean, I remember,
I was like, "Oh, my God."

37:41.050 --> 37:43.094
And it wasn't the beauty alone.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.680
It was this sweet, sweet...

37:45.764 --> 37:48.475
Oh, my God.
Honey, did I ever tell ya?

37:49.059 --> 37:50.268
I'm crazy about you.

37:50.351 --> 37:51.895
Wow.

37:51.978 --> 37:53.729
That's really sweet.

37:53.813 --> 37:56.441
I like a guy that just thinks
everything I do is great.

37:57.025 --> 37:59.527
And not only that,
but I mean, he was like,

37:59.610 --> 38:01.905
"If you don't wanna do anything tonight,
you don't have to."

38:01.988 --> 38:03.198
He was not...

38:03.990 --> 38:08.077
he was not making me do a bunch
of weird stuff all in one night.

38:08.161 --> 38:09.579
I spread it out.

38:09.662 --> 38:11.747
But it felt respectful.

38:11.831 --> 38:15.335
And I like how that felt, and he, uh...

38:15.418 --> 38:18.755
And you liked
when I bought you the baseball team.

38:18.838 --> 38:22.383
The day that I got her that baseball team,
the look on her face,

38:22.467 --> 38:25.386
she's like a nine-year-old girl
at Christmas.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.973
It was so sweet, and it just...

38:28.849 --> 38:31.476
He put the team in my name,
and that meant a lot, too.

38:31.559 --> 38:34.562
Yeah, my lawyer almost killed me,
but I did it.

38:35.730 --> 38:38.441
Well, I'm awfully glad I have this woman
in my life,

38:38.524 --> 38:41.069
and I hope she's here to stay. And...

38:41.152 --> 38:43.696
I haven't left him,
and I think it's because...

38:44.697 --> 38:48.743
he continues to show me a good time.
He tells me whatever I do is cool.

38:49.744 --> 38:53.623
I mean, I'll make
some macramé shit bag, you know?

38:54.875 --> 38:58.336
And he'll just go, "That's a masterpiece,"
or something. You know what I mean?

38:58.419 --> 39:00.421
Just don't make me carry it. Please.

39:00.505 --> 39:03.049
And then he wants to sniff it.
He wants to sniff all my bags.

39:03.133 --> 39:04.217
I do.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.301
That's weird, but...

39:06.261 --> 39:09.639
You know what? I'll take that
over some guy defecating on my head.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.602
Hey, leave that cookie jar alone.

39:14.685 --> 39:16.146
You deserve a good spankin'.

39:16.229 --> 39:17.522
- What? Hi.
- Hey.

39:17.605 --> 39:18.857
What are you going after there, sarge?

39:18.940 --> 39:20.608
-Just tryin' to get some almonds up there.
-Here, use me.

39:20.691 --> 39:22.277
-No. I'm okay. Thank you.
-All right.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.945
Thank you, though. I got this.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.782
I'm gonna take you with me
when I climb Mount Everest.

39:27.866 --> 39:28.950
That'll be a fun trip.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.618
Might be the first little guy
to be up there.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.912
Have a seat.
Let me give you a hand here, buddy.

39:32.996 --> 39:34.289
I can climb it. It's fine.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.291
- All right.
- It's okay. I'm okay.

39:36.374 --> 39:37.500
Yeah, I wanna help you
someway, man.

39:37.583 --> 39:41.254
It's okay. You can help me
just by sittin' down. That's fine.

39:42.547 --> 39:45.508
I can't take my eyes off of you.
You're a funny little guy.

39:45.591 --> 39:46.634
Thanks.

39:46.717 --> 39:48.594
You'd make a good mascot.

39:48.678 --> 39:50.889
-Actually, I am. I'm a mascot.
-Oh!

39:50.972 --> 39:52.056
My name is Ron. I'm the Worm.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.183
Oh, you're the Worm!

39:53.266 --> 39:54.434
-I've heard talk about you.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

39:54.517 --> 39:56.060
I think I saw you.

39:56.144 --> 39:58.187
Oh, good.
Hope you liked what you saw.

39:58.271 --> 39:59.898
-Yeah! I sure did.
-Yeah?

39:59.981 --> 40:01.357
Is that how you got to this size?

40:01.441 --> 40:02.483
Huh?

40:02.567 --> 40:05.778
I mean, did they make you this size
just to fit in the Worm costume?

40:05.861 --> 40:08.864
No, they made me this size
when I was born.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.533
I was born... I was born like this.

40:10.616 --> 40:12.285
Oh, so, you're a legitimate little person?

40:12.368 --> 40:14.037
Yeah, I'm not a fake little person.

40:14.120 --> 40:17.123
Oh, I see. I thought maybe they
shrunk you down or somethin'.

40:17.207 --> 40:20.376
-No, it's not like they...
-'Cause it's a very competitive contest.

40:20.460 --> 40:23.588
Yeah, I don't think
that technology exists yet.

40:23.671 --> 40:28.217
How do you drive a car? Does some...
Do you sit on someone's lap or what?

40:28.301 --> 40:29.594
No, I just...

40:29.677 --> 40:31.762
I bet it's a real tiny, little car, is it?

40:31.846 --> 40:34.682
Tell me everything.
This fascinates the hell out of me.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.267
I have a pretty standard car.

40:36.351 --> 40:39.645
You have another little person down there
operatin' the pedals for you?

40:39.729 --> 40:44.692
No, I basically just have
a metal rod that goes on top of a pedal,

40:44.776 --> 40:45.902
and there's another pedal on top of that.

40:45.985 --> 40:49.280
You just attach it with some bolts
and a wrench, and then you have a...

40:49.364 --> 40:51.282
It's a pedal extender. And that's it.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.785
You lost me somewhere in there,
but I guess it's all kind of...

40:53.868 --> 40:56.287
I don't know if you know
who Jack the Plumber is.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.581
-Yeah, the mascot. Yep.
-Well, I manage him.

40:58.664 --> 41:00.959
-Oh, great.
-He's got a wonderful act.

41:01.042 --> 41:02.210
He's missin' somethin'.

41:02.293 --> 41:05.922
He's missin' a little button
at the end of his act,

41:06.005 --> 41:07.966
and I got somethin' percolating
in my brain.

41:08.049 --> 41:09.925
-Okay.
-But I need another person.

41:10.010 --> 41:13.054
-All right.
-It's got to be a person of your, uh...

41:13.972 --> 41:15.056
-Persuasion.
-Right.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.558
Okay, so you want me to recruit
a little person for you?

41:17.642 --> 41:20.019
Another little person,
shorter than you even.

41:20.103 --> 41:21.146
-Smaller the better.
-Shorter than me?

41:21.229 --> 41:22.355
'Cause we all know each other?

41:22.438 --> 41:25.274
Is that a fact? Well, all I want is one.

41:25.358 --> 41:28.486
I'll go down into the tunnel,
where we all live

41:28.569 --> 41:32.032
and, uh... blow into the magical horn

41:32.115 --> 41:33.700
-that lets...
-You're funnin' me, but okay.

41:33.783 --> 41:35.118
-You got a good sense of humor.
-I'll ask 'em.

41:35.201 --> 41:36.369
Ask me for five bucks.

41:36.452 --> 41:37.328
Uh...

41:37.996 --> 41:40.956
-I would like $5, please.
-I'm a little short this week.

41:41.041 --> 41:42.125
Get it?

41:44.710 --> 41:46.212
-Hi.
-Hi.

41:48.881 --> 41:51.634
-Waitin'.
-Yeah. How you doin'?

41:51.717 --> 41:53.136
I've been better.

41:53.719 --> 41:55.180
-Long day?
-Yeah.

41:55.263 --> 41:56.597
Yeah. Me too.

41:57.307 --> 42:01.352
My wife and I are doing this
never-go-to-bed-angry thing, you know.

42:01.436 --> 42:04.272
So, I'm just exhausted.

42:04.355 --> 42:07.483
-You know, we haven't been sleeping.
-I'm sorry.

42:09.819 --> 42:11.529
-It's hard, huh?
-Yeah, it's really hard.

42:11.612 --> 42:13.281
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

42:13.364 --> 42:16.200
-You have a nice... a beautiful laugh.
-Thank you.

42:16.284 --> 42:18.661
-I don't wanna be too forward, but you...
-No. No.

42:18.744 --> 42:20.246
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

42:20.330 --> 42:21.789
I don't hate your eyes.

42:23.124 --> 42:24.542
-Really?
-I don't.

42:24.625 --> 42:25.710
That's nice.

42:25.793 --> 42:28.546
They're like if two clouds had babies.

42:30.631 --> 42:32.800
My wife says
that I look like I have cataracts.

42:32.883 --> 42:33.926
Oh!

42:34.009 --> 42:35.010
And she says it so much

42:35.095 --> 42:37.388
that I actually went to an ophthalmologist
and got it checked out,

42:37.472 --> 42:39.432
and he said,
"No, those are just your eyes."

42:39.515 --> 42:41.601
-Okay.
-I like your whistle.

42:43.061 --> 42:44.729
-Thank you.
-That's cool.

42:45.855 --> 42:47.148
I like to put my lips on it.

42:49.150 --> 42:51.319
It's like a friend in my mouth.

43:04.624 --> 43:06.292
Uh...

43:06.376 --> 43:08.086
Oh, you wanna try my gum?

43:08.169 --> 43:10.380
-What?
-You wanna try my gum?

43:32.026 --> 43:34.195
-Robin Wexler.
-Phil.

43:34.279 --> 43:35.571
Holy cow.

43:35.655 --> 43:37.157
-Hey.
-Look at you.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.158
-Oh.
-Oh, God!

43:39.242 --> 43:41.202
-It's so good to see you.
-Wow!

43:41.286 --> 43:42.745
-God.
-Nice to see you, too.

43:42.828 --> 43:44.622
-How long has it been?
-I don't know, it's...

43:44.705 --> 43:45.706
Twenty-three and a half years.

43:45.790 --> 43:46.999
So, you went to Higbee?

43:47.083 --> 43:49.418
Yeah, of course.
Remember? I was the mascot.

43:49.502 --> 43:51.337
You know, I just never knew
who was in there.

43:51.421 --> 43:53.631
I remember the mascot.
I didn't know that was you.

43:53.714 --> 43:55.841
-Yeah, that was me. That was me.
-Wow!

43:55.925 --> 43:58.511
-God, it's so good to see you.
-Well, thanks for doing this.

43:58.594 --> 43:59.970
Oh, are you kidding me?
It's my pleasure.

44:00.054 --> 44:03.391
It's like it's a reason to perform
and also to reconnect with an old friend.

44:03.474 --> 44:04.809
-Great.
-God, we had so much fun, didn't we?

44:05.560 --> 44:06.602
I guess.

44:06.686 --> 44:07.978
Do you remember
Mr. Drum's technology class,

44:08.062 --> 44:09.272
when you and I were partnered up to build

44:09.355 --> 44:10.648
that bridge out of popsicle sticks?

44:10.731 --> 44:13.609
And you were like, "I wish we could have
eaten these popsicles beforehand."

44:13.693 --> 44:14.944
We were crackin' up.

44:15.027 --> 44:16.111
I don't remember that.

44:16.196 --> 44:17.697
Oh, man. It was good times.

44:17.780 --> 44:19.115
I feel like I wanna give you another hug.

44:19.199 --> 44:20.783
Oh, that's okay.
Why don't I give you a tour?

44:20.866 --> 44:21.867
Sure. Sure, sure.

44:21.951 --> 44:25.037
After Connor went to college,
I had all this free time, I thought,

44:25.120 --> 44:29.459
"I wanna work with disadvantaged children
that are really pretty disadvantaged."

44:29.542 --> 44:32.211
-Yeah, you wanna give back.
-I wanna give back. That's exactly right.

44:32.295 --> 44:34.714
-I completely... I'm with you.
-You know. But I mean, I get crazy.

44:34.797 --> 44:37.883
Sometimes, I'll go to a movie
in the middle of the afternoon.

44:37.967 --> 44:40.178
But I really wanna
spend my time giving back.

44:40.261 --> 44:42.012
- You know, I just...
- I celebrate that.

44:42.096 --> 44:46.350
I think mascotting is... To me,
it's all about giving back, you know.

44:47.268 --> 44:49.562
Robin, I don't know
if you're busy tomorrow,

44:49.645 --> 44:52.899
but I do have a ticket
for the mascot competition in Anaheim,

44:52.982 --> 44:56.736
and I was wondering
if maybe you'd like to be my guest.

44:56.819 --> 44:58.195
That's great.
Do you care if I bring David?

44:59.530 --> 45:00.865
I thought your son's name was Connor.

45:00.948 --> 45:02.450
It is. David's my fiancé.

45:02.533 --> 45:04.244
We should get in. Let's go.

45:09.039 --> 45:11.208
Oh, the kids are so excited.

45:13.043 --> 45:15.880
- It says "center for the blind."
- Right. Right.

45:16.756 --> 45:19.759
-Are all these kids blind?
-Oh, yeah, they're all blind. All of them.

45:19.842 --> 45:23.178
I'm worried that my act
is gonna get kind of lost on them.

45:23.846 --> 45:26.724
Oh, no, these kids,
they just wanna have a good time.

45:26.807 --> 45:28.934
-And they're all blind?
-Yeah, they're all blind.

45:29.018 --> 45:30.144
But the teachers can see.

45:30.227 --> 45:32.772
Uh, no. Most of the teachers are blind.

45:32.855 --> 45:35.316
Actually, we have one teacher
who's not completely blind.

45:35.400 --> 45:36.442
He's legally blind.

45:37.026 --> 45:38.945
-And where's he?
-He's home sick today.

45:39.612 --> 45:42.282
Okay. Right, okay. All right.

45:42.365 --> 45:44.284
Hey, you're gonna do great.

45:46.243 --> 45:47.328
Have fun.

46:04.136 --> 46:07.264
- Hi. Wow!
- Hey. Wow!

46:07.348 --> 46:09.058
-You look happy and relaxed.
-Thank you.

46:09.141 --> 46:10.351
You look good.
What do you wanna do?

46:10.435 --> 46:11.644
I definitely wanna do
this jousting thing.

46:11.727 --> 46:12.770
Mmm.

46:12.853 --> 46:15.773
And they have a ladies fishin' night.
We can all go out on a boat.

46:15.856 --> 46:18.568
Oh, no way. That is gonna be good.
This is Cindi.

46:18.651 --> 46:21.028
-That's only $11 to go out on a boat.
-Yeah.

46:21.111 --> 46:22.863
-Oh, two for one.
-Uh-huh.

46:22.947 --> 46:25.616
Two of us can go for the same price
as one ticket.

46:25.700 --> 46:26.701
I gotta go.

46:28.744 --> 46:29.912
Hey, you okay?

46:29.995 --> 46:31.706
I don't know!

46:43.175 --> 46:44.301
What'd I do?

46:44.885 --> 46:47.888
Miss Babineaux, a formal complaint
has been lodged against you.

46:47.972 --> 46:49.557
It has come to our attention

46:49.640 --> 46:52.893
that your college basketball team
is nicknamed the Leaping Squaws,

46:52.977 --> 46:56.689
which means that your character
is in violation of rule 11B,

46:56.772 --> 47:02.820
which states, "Mascots cannot represent
or be associated with anything offensive

47:02.903 --> 47:07.617
based on race, creed,
gender or sexual orientation."

47:07.700 --> 47:09.076
Well, um... I...

47:10.036 --> 47:11.162
I'm an armadillo,

47:11.871 --> 47:15.625
and the team isn't called
the Leaping Squaws anymore.

47:15.708 --> 47:18.544
That was, like,
100 years ago or somethin'.

47:18.627 --> 47:21.255
Unfortunately,
it is still on the Internet.

47:21.338 --> 47:24.299
Yeah, but I've read on the Internet
that man's living on the moon,

47:24.384 --> 47:25.760
and that's not true, so...

47:25.843 --> 47:27.762
And you can't trust Wikipedia, either.

47:27.845 --> 47:30.139
Yeah, not everything on Wikipedia is true.

47:30.222 --> 47:31.306
Who made this complaint?

47:31.391 --> 47:33.476
I'm sorry, but rule 22C

47:33.559 --> 47:37.688
states that the president cannot disclose
the identity of the formal complainant.

47:45.738 --> 47:49.199
-I don't know what to say. Um...
-Please don't cry.

47:49.283 --> 47:52.953
I'm an armadillo.
We're not the Leaping Squaws anymore.

47:54.955 --> 47:56.582
I understand that.

47:56.666 --> 48:01.045
But since you are representing something
that might be considered offensive,

48:01.128 --> 48:03.423
this could be grounds
for disqualification.

48:03.506 --> 48:04.924
I'm Choctaw.

48:05.716 --> 48:06.759
I'll tell you what,

48:06.842 --> 48:09.595
why don't you step outside,
and the jury can deliberate.

48:12.014 --> 48:14.433
Sweetheart. Oh!

48:14.975 --> 48:16.143
I just feel horrible.

48:16.226 --> 48:17.562
-Well, yeah.
-Me, too.

48:17.645 --> 48:20.523
I've never thought of "squaw"
as being an offensive term.

48:20.606 --> 48:21.649
Never. Me too.

48:21.732 --> 48:24.652
And frankly, I'm more offended
by the word "leaping."

48:24.735 --> 48:27.697
-Why?
-Well, it's blatantly homophobic.

48:27.780 --> 48:29.198
What?

48:29.281 --> 48:32.284
I'm just not offended by the word "squaw."
It means a little Indian girl.

48:32.368 --> 48:33.911
I think "squaw" is sweet.

48:33.994 --> 48:35.663
You gotta quit saying that word.

48:35.746 --> 48:38.999
It's the s-word.
It's a bad term.

48:39.083 --> 48:40.793
Talk to your Native American friends.

48:40.876 --> 48:43.671
It's the same as the c-word,
or the n-word or something.

48:43.754 --> 48:46.632
You're comparing the term "squaw"
with the c-word?

48:46.716 --> 48:48.092
-That's what it means.
-What?

48:48.175 --> 48:49.719
-What?
-That's what it means.

48:49.802 --> 48:52.680
You know, what we need to do is check
with the Indian guy in the gift shop

48:52.763 --> 48:55.641
and ask him if he finds
the term "squaw" offensive.

48:55.725 --> 48:58.185
But he's East Indian.
He's not Native American.

48:58.268 --> 48:59.812
Well, what is the difference?

48:59.895 --> 49:03.232
Well, one is in Asia.
One is in the American continent.

49:03.315 --> 49:05.025
I always thought he was Pakistani.

49:05.109 --> 49:06.443
I just called him Eddy.

49:06.527 --> 49:07.695
-Eddy? Is his name Eddy?
-Yeah.

49:07.778 --> 49:09.864
Oh, God. I've been calling him Kent.

49:09.947 --> 49:12.241
Oh, my. Well, it doesn't matter to him.

49:12.324 --> 49:14.451
It doesn't matter to Eddy.
Call him whatever you want.

49:14.535 --> 49:18.664
I'd like to make a motion that we
reject the claim against this young lady.

49:18.748 --> 49:19.999
I would second that.

49:20.082 --> 49:23.127
All in favor of the motion,
say "aye" and lift your hands up.

49:23.210 --> 49:24.754
Aye.

49:26.130 --> 49:27.673
- Hey, babe.
- Oh, my God.

49:27.756 --> 49:30.384
I know. I know. I'm not disqualified.

49:30.467 --> 49:32.177
- You're not?
- I'm not.

49:32.261 --> 49:33.387
-Babineaux.
-Babineaux.

49:33.470 --> 49:36.599
-Whoo!
-Yeah, sister. Yeah. So I'm relieved.

49:36.682 --> 49:39.268
-That was an ordeal. It was nuts.
-Yeah.

49:39.852 --> 49:41.395
-I'm starvin'.
-All right.

49:41.478 --> 49:42.688
-I'm really hungry.
-Okay.

49:42.771 --> 49:45.900
-What do you want?
-I could go with, like, wings

49:45.983 --> 49:47.526
or biscuits or like...

49:47.610 --> 49:50.321
I kind of would love to try sushi.

49:50.404 --> 49:52.322
Mmm... I don't know about that.

49:52.406 --> 49:54.158
-They have fried stuff.
-Okay.

49:54.241 --> 49:55.701
-Yeah. I think it'll be fun.
-Ooh!

49:55.784 --> 49:57.077
-That's exciting.
-Let's go. Did you pay?

49:57.161 --> 49:58.788
I did. We're good.

50:00.122 --> 50:01.666
-Mmm, delicious.
-Okay.

50:01.749 --> 50:05.377
<i>Its 9:00 a.m.</i>
<i>and 71 degrees in beautiful Anaheim,</i>

<i>and people are already lining up</i>

50:11.551 --> 50:16.180
<i>Word on the street has it</i>
<i>that there are some unbelievable acts.</i>

50:16.263 --> 50:19.099
<i>There are some seats still available.</i>

50:19.183 --> 50:24.104
<i>So, why don't you grab a friend,</i>
<i>head on down there and check it out?</i>

50:24.188 --> 50:25.565
What was it all for, huh?

50:26.524 --> 50:29.527
Dehydration, heat exhaustion,
the hours in the head, what was it for?

50:30.194 --> 50:31.361
It was for today.

50:32.404 --> 50:34.865
Failure is not an option.

50:35.866 --> 50:41.538
Today is the day that you go out there
and you show the world who Phil Mayhew is.

50:43.540 --> 50:44.625
Do it.

50:48.253 --> 50:49.922
- Let me get that.
- Thank you.

50:51.340 --> 50:52.549
Big ladder.

50:55.052 --> 50:56.053
Thanks.

51:05.730 --> 51:06.939
I know you.

51:07.523 --> 51:09.275
-I don't think so.
-Yeah.

51:09.358 --> 51:12.695
You're... We had the Mexican
the other day. It was spicy.

51:12.778 --> 51:13.612
Mascots?

51:15.698 --> 51:16.991
The Fist.

51:17.074 --> 51:20.286
-What's the ladder for?
-Oh, this? The ladder, yeah.

51:20.369 --> 51:21.829
It's for a new bit.

51:21.912 --> 51:23.622
You know, for Anaheim, the big show.

51:23.706 --> 51:25.875
-Oh?
-I really want to smash it.

51:25.958 --> 51:30.504
And I'd had a bit involving the ladder,
but my dad's not too keen.

51:30.587 --> 51:32.798
-Your dad?
-My dad was Sid before me.

51:32.882 --> 51:35.134
-Oh?
-And his dad was Sid before him.

51:35.217 --> 51:38.387
So sort of it's a family tradition.
We've all done it.

51:38.470 --> 51:41.473
-They're not Sid anymore.
-No. No, I'm Sid now. Yeah.

51:41.556 --> 51:43.433
So, what does it matter what they think?

51:44.018 --> 51:45.227
Well, it shouldn't.

51:46.562 --> 51:49.356
And I love Dad, and I love his routine,

51:49.439 --> 51:51.233
but it's just not...

51:51.316 --> 51:53.152
I really think it can be much better.

51:54.612 --> 51:56.405
Sarah loves it. Sarah loves the whole...

51:56.488 --> 51:59.074
-Your mom?
-No. No, not... No, my wife.

52:00.492 --> 52:02.036
Underneath that, there's a ring.

52:02.119 --> 52:04.204
She's really supportive of...
She's my rock.

52:04.288 --> 52:06.081
I don't know what I'd do without her.

52:06.165 --> 52:08.542
She's my best friend.

52:09.584 --> 52:11.003
Can I give you some advice, Hedgehog?

52:11.086 --> 52:12.546
Yeah, of course.

52:12.629 --> 52:15.883
There once was a boy who wanted a father,

52:15.966 --> 52:18.678
but instead, he was promised an empire.

52:19.428 --> 52:21.596
So when he didn't get love
from his father,

52:21.681 --> 52:23.640
he went looking for that empire.

52:26.852 --> 52:29.188
Not my words.
The words of Michael Landon.

52:29.271 --> 52:31.565
Season 1, Episode 8
of <i>Highway to Heaven.</i>

52:31.649 --> 52:33.901
<i>Highway to Heaven. </i> Wow, yeah.

52:33.984 --> 52:35.569
Think about it.

52:35.652 --> 52:37.196
Was he an angel?

52:39.364 --> 52:42.159
-Keep climbing, Hedgehog.
-Thanks, Tommy.

52:42.242 --> 52:44.578
Oh, good luck, mate.

52:44.661 --> 52:45.788
Thank you.

53:02.763 --> 53:05.599
-Hey, Cindi?
-It's open.

53:10.729 --> 53:12.606
Oh, my God.
What happened?

53:13.440 --> 53:14.734
The sushi...

53:15.943 --> 53:17.361
it had bugs in it.

53:17.444 --> 53:18.988
I'm so sorry.

53:20.655 --> 53:22.282
People aren't supposed to eat live fish.

53:23.367 --> 53:26.453
I know.

53:31.959 --> 53:33.961
Pull over.

53:34.044 --> 53:37.047
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, shit.

53:37.131 --> 53:39.717
- Pull over, now.
- Is that for me? Oh, bugger.

53:39.800 --> 53:42.094
What do I do? What do I do?
What? Pull over.

53:42.177 --> 53:44.764
You're driving
on the wrong side of the street.

53:44.847 --> 53:46.098
Pull over immediately.

53:47.391 --> 53:48.600

53:50.936 --> 53:52.897

53:54.606 --> 53:57.151
-to go on stage.
-What?

53:58.402 --> 54:00.029
I'm too sick.

54:00.112 --> 54:02.114
No, you gotta do it.

I don't know it like you do.
You are Alvin.

54:22.009 --> 54:24.511
-It doesn't matter.
-But you've been doing it your whole life.

54:24.594 --> 54:26.972
I can't go up there and do something
you've been doing your whole life.

54:27.056 --> 54:29.474

-This morning at the hotel.

55:04.844 --> 55:07.346
After his Coco Pops, he said
he was gonna go and take that ladder back

55:07.429 --> 55:08.597
and meet me here.

55:08.680 --> 55:09.974
Well, why didn't he do it yesterday?

55:10.057 --> 55:12.517
He wouldn't have had to do it at all
if you hadn't told him to do it.

55:12.601 --> 55:15.395
-Biggest day of his life.
-Biggest day of your life, more like.

-Okay.

56:50.699 --> 56:52.993
A pencil
and a pencil sharpener.

56:53.077 --> 56:56.496
That's one of the last joys in life,
sharpening a pencil.

56:56.580 --> 56:58.623

-Whoo!
-Hey, two things.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:04.262
First, FYI, I found out it's free sausage
night tonight at the waffle place.

01:02:04.346 --> 01:02:05.430
All you can eat.

01:02:05.514 --> 01:02:09.684
Secondly, and more important,
how do you feel it went out there?

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:12.687
To be honest,
I was a little nervous about the poo,

01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:15.398
but you know,
they ate it up, so to speak.

01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:19.068
Couple of beats after the solo,
I missed a couple of steps, you know...

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:21.488
I didn't watch the whole thing,
but you did a great job.

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:22.781
-Okay.
-Hey, look at this.

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:25.074
That's Tiny. Did you meet him? The Worm?

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:26.701
No, I was distracted.

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:28.912
You know, they can criticize our country,

01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:31.873
but if a rabbi can get together
with a worm

01:02:31.956 --> 01:02:35.460
and entertain our citizens,
we got a pretty solid future.

01:02:35.544 --> 01:02:37.421
Well, my head's still kinda
in the head right now,

01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:39.464
so I'm gonna walk it off.

01:02:39.548 --> 01:02:41.966

-Thank you.

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:43.552

Hey, partner.
What's the problem?

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:45.697
Oh, the greedy little bugger.
Do you have any coins?

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:46.990
Coins?

01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:48.492
For the paper machine.

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:50.577
Whatever you're smoking,
you got any more of that?

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.662
I've got loads of it
in the motor home if you want.

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:54.247

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.224

01:04:23.735 --> 01:04:26.196
Okay. Round two, coming up.

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:27.364

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:29.282
- Too hard.
- What are you doing?

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:31.743
What do you mean what am I doing?
Is this what's happening right now?

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:34.954
Now, you're upset. I need you
to get out of my face right now.

01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:36.748
- Idiot.
- Oh, I'm an idiot?

01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:38.500
You're a criminal moron.

01:04:45.924 --> 01:04:47.801
- You wanna drag us to hell?
- Idiot!

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:49.636
I'll go to hell with ya.

- What are you doing?
- It's a huge part of my life!

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:14.536
I don't know what went wrong.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:18.164
Whoa.

01:05:22.376 --> 01:05:24.754
What? What?

01:05:24.838 --> 01:05:26.631
-What are you doing?
-We're okay.

-No, we're not okay!
-We're okay.

-You ruined it. You ruined it.
-We're okay.

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:31.845
This place is massive.

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:33.680
He ain't in the building.
We've already been here!

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:34.931
This is the last place we look.

01:05:35.014 --> 01:05:36.641
If he ain't here,
we're gonna have to call the police.

01:05:36.725 --> 01:05:37.767
Call the morgue.

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:39.185
-Oh, my God.
-Hey!

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:40.562
-Well, where have you been?
-I'm here.

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:41.980
-Sorry, sorry.
-We've been going mental.

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:44.065
-I got pulled over by the Old Bill.
-You what?

01:05:44.148 --> 01:05:46.109
And then
my policeman Tourette's kicked in.

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:47.861
-You're joking.
-I said stuff that I shouldn't have said.

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:49.237
-Oh, my God.
-You could have got shot!

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.363
-No, he did have...
-What's this doing here?

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:51.698
Stop worrying
about the poor little ladder, Dad.

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:53.950
-Shut up about the fucking ladder.
-Right. Okay.

01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:55.785
-I love you.
-Oh, God.

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:57.537
I love you.
You're an old pillock, but I love you.

01:05:57.621 --> 01:05:58.788
-Right, go.
-Smash it, babe.

01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:00.499
Sit down, shut up.
Enjoy the show.

01:06:00.582 --> 01:06:02.208
- Give 'em hell.
- Touchdown.

01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:23.396
That's a match.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.648
-Yeah, a match.
-Oh, yeah.

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:02.226
Okay.

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:15.907
I made it.

01:07:16.658 --> 01:07:18.117
Oh, sweetie.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:19.536
-I made it.
-Oh, my God, you did.

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:21.412
-Oh!
-I know.

01:07:21.495 --> 01:07:22.747
Oh, my God.

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:24.332
I know.

01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:26.084
Oh, you still throwing up?

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:27.669
Throwing up and diarrhea.

01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:28.962
-Oh, out both ends?
-Yes.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:31.590
It's like a war going on,
but right now, it's stopped.

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:33.550
I'm sorry, babe.

01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:34.509

I'm sorry you can't do it. I really am.

01:07:42.684 --> 01:07:44.060
It's okay.

01:07:45.519 --> 01:07:47.856
I can't wait to see you do it.

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:51.192
But you're the best at it.

01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:55.279
Okay, Alvin, do my sister good.

01:07:55.363 --> 01:07:56.781

01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:33.954
And no winner was unanimous.

01:20:34.038 --> 01:20:36.248
Each one of us had
to serve as a tiebreaker.

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:39.460
So, I think that goes to show
the high level of competition,

01:20:39.543 --> 01:20:42.463
and so, certainly,
congratulations to all the finalists.

01:20:42.546 --> 01:20:47.176
And it is now my honor
to introduce to you, Gabby Monkhouse.

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:48.552
Whoo!

01:20:48.635 --> 01:20:51.805
Thank you, Buddy.
Thank you so much.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:57.936
And now, the World Mascot Association
Bronze Fluffy goes to...

01:20:59.271 --> 01:21:03.609
Jack the Plumber, Beaumont College,
Modesto, California.

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:05.903
Plumber time!

01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:13.285
Congratulations, Jack.
Well deserved.

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:14.370
Hi, there.

01:21:15.162 --> 01:21:17.081
Thank you, Gabby.
Thank you so much.

01:21:17.164 --> 01:21:19.833
The second place,
or silver category of Fluffy,

01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:22.836
from the World Mascot Association
goes to...

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:28.008
Heshe the Rabbi and Willy the Worm,
Tussolon Tigers Canoe Team, Israel.

01:21:28.091 --> 01:21:29.301
Shalom.

01:21:32.345 --> 01:21:34.014
Congratulations, Heshe.

01:21:34.098 --> 01:21:35.307
And now we'll go on,

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:38.394
to keep things moving,
to the first place, or gold, category...

01:21:38.477 --> 01:21:40.104
No, I announce the gold category.

01:21:40.187 --> 01:21:42.022
-You gave out the bronze.
-I gave out the bronze.

01:21:42.105 --> 01:21:43.649
You gave out the silver.
Then I do the gold.

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:44.733
I'm getting a hand signal.

01:21:44.817 --> 01:21:47.903
-I think they want me to continue.
-No, I am the senior judge, so...

01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:49.530
-Just give it to her.
-I am the senior judge.

01:21:49.613 --> 01:21:51.364
I will then surrender the mic to the lady.

01:21:51.448 --> 01:21:55.119
Thank you. I wrote a book,
and I got more applause than you did.

01:21:55.202 --> 01:21:56.954
-Oh, please.
-All right.

01:21:57.037 --> 01:22:00.082
Well, it is my honor,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:22:00.165 --> 01:22:03.836
to present the World Mascot Association's
highest honor.

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:07.548
The Gold Fluffy goes to...

01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:11.301
Oh, I could read it
if you don't have it prepared.

01:22:11.385 --> 01:22:12.719
No, I can do that.

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:17.850
Sid the Hedgehog,
Willingham Rovers, South Croydon.

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:19.810
Merry old England.

01:22:26.233 --> 01:22:28.694
Congratulations, Sid. Congratulations.

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:33.782
Congratulations to Sid the Hedgehog
and all of our contestants!

01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:36.619
Thank you all so much
for coming today.

01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:40.122
We really appreciate it.
We'll see you here next year.

01:22:47.921 --> 01:22:50.257
There have been some big,
big changes.

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:52.676
-Good, good changes.
-Good changes.

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:53.969
Um...

01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:57.305
The mascot competition
was a tipping point for us.

01:22:57.389 --> 01:22:58.431
-Yeah.
-You know.

01:22:58.516 --> 01:23:03.186
I mean, it was just a fiasco.
Emotionally, professionally, personally.

01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:06.231
So, you know, we just took
a long, hard look at our lives

01:23:06.314 --> 01:23:07.983
and said, "It ain't working."

01:23:08.066 --> 01:23:09.192
Yeah.

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.988
And what do we need to do?
We need to change it.

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:14.406
Mm-hmm.

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:16.408
And we have.

01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:18.994
And I feel born anew.

01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:20.829
-That's nice.
-Well, I do.

01:23:20.913 --> 01:23:23.248
And, you know, it's springtime.

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:24.708
Oh.

01:23:24.792 --> 01:23:25.834
Okay.

01:23:31.924 --> 01:23:34.885
-Sorry about that.
-Sorry. I guess we can't help ourselves.

01:23:34.968 --> 01:23:36.386
We're those people now.

01:23:37.888 --> 01:23:41.141
The kind you're like,
"Could they really be that in love?"

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:44.186
And that really... I mean,
that used to, literally, never happen.

01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:46.688
No. I couldn't resist.

01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:51.193
Part of what's helped,
and probably the biggest change,

01:23:51.276 --> 01:23:53.696
is that we are no longer mascotting.

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:56.365
-The team was sold, and we were let go.
-Yeah.

01:23:56.448 --> 01:23:58.909
And we get to spend
way more time together.

01:23:58.992 --> 01:24:00.035
Yeah.

01:24:00.118 --> 01:24:01.745
Uh, we hired Courtney.

01:24:01.829 --> 01:24:04.372
- Yeah, you hired her.
- Yeah, I did. She's our nanny.

01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:05.583
Yeah.

01:24:13.131 --> 01:24:15.050
-You've got something on your nose.
-Oops.

01:24:15.133 --> 01:24:16.260
-Sorry about that.
-What was that?

01:24:16.343 --> 01:24:17.553
You got something on your nose, I think.

01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:18.887
-Where? Here?
-Yeah.

01:24:18.971 --> 01:24:20.180
You got it. Yeah.

01:24:21.181 --> 01:24:22.307
You're good.

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:25.435
-You're welcome.
-Oh, sorry.

01:24:25.519 --> 01:24:28.230
It's hard to thank people
when they hurt your face.

01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:31.984
Oh! He's a little baby.
He's a little baby.

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:35.571
I'm a baby with an abusive mommy.

01:24:35.654 --> 01:24:37.280
-Bad baby.
-Yeah.

01:24:37.364 --> 01:24:39.116
She has Munchausen syndrome.

01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:42.202
Help. Help!

01:24:43.536 --> 01:24:45.956
But, you know, and that's
the kind of chemistry that we have now.

01:24:46.039 --> 01:24:47.625
-Yeah, it's fun.
-And it's fun.

01:24:52.379 --> 01:24:54.172
Hello, Miss B.

01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:55.423
How are you?

01:24:55.507 --> 01:24:57.217
<i>After the competition,</i>

01:24:57.301 --> 01:25:01.888
we both decided to volunteer
at the retirement home for mascots.

01:25:02.806 --> 01:25:04.850
-And I find it very rewarding, you know.
-Yeah.

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:09.646
I can use my dance,
and I can help heal people, really.

01:25:09.730 --> 01:25:12.524
And I can move,
and they can watch me move,

01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:15.736
and I see that they're movin'
through me and what I do.

01:25:15.819 --> 01:25:18.071
I find it so peaceful, and I just...

01:25:18.155 --> 01:25:20.699
I love old people, so...
I always have.

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:25.537
I love talking to them,
and I love being just quiet with them.

01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:27.789
So I'm lovin' it.

01:25:27.873 --> 01:25:29.792
And I feel so fulfilled, too,

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:34.004
because she's working on the insides
and I'm working on people's outsides.

01:25:34.713 --> 01:25:37.883
I brought my nail art here,
to the seniors.

01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:40.468
And, um... you know,
couple times a week,

01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:45.641
I show up with my bottles of paint,
and my nail files and my brushes and...

01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:49.895
You know, these seniors have,
like, gnarled up fingers like this.

01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:51.271
Almost like a T. rex.

01:25:52.355 --> 01:25:56.401
And they put their hands in my hands

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:58.487
and they open 'em up.

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:02.616
It's been an emotional day
'cause we lost someone today.

01:26:02.699 --> 01:26:03.742
Steve Redington.

01:26:03.826 --> 01:26:07.370
He was Randy the Elephant.
He was a great, great man.

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:18.048
<i>You know,</i>
<i>Randy will always be alive.</i>

01:26:18.882 --> 01:26:21.844
'Cause, you know,
mascots, they don't die.

01:26:21.927 --> 01:26:23.053
That's right. They don't.

01:26:23.136 --> 01:26:24.680
They don't. They just, uh...

01:26:25.555 --> 01:26:26.849
They just hang in a closet.

01:26:26.932 --> 01:26:30.268
Yeah, 'cause they're... It's an outfit.

01:26:30.352 --> 01:26:32.062
It is. It's an outfit.

01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:35.607
So much has changed
since the competition.

01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:37.693
The biggest news being...

01:26:38.318 --> 01:26:39.695
Ta-da!

01:26:40.696 --> 01:26:43.198
-We done a little baby, didn't we?
-Yeah.

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:44.867
We done a girl baby.

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:46.618
The best sort of baby.

01:26:46.702 --> 01:26:48.453
Like you, yes.

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:49.579
It's Daddy.

01:26:49.662 --> 01:26:51.498
Well, what else has happened?
Oh, um...

01:26:51.581 --> 01:26:52.708
I sold the butcher's...

01:26:53.416 --> 01:26:58.505
and Sarah and I now run
a lovely little vegetarian café in Purley.

01:26:58.588 --> 01:26:59.672
-Posh.
-Ooh!

01:26:59.757 --> 01:27:01.967
Excuse me. Purley.

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:03.301
Very posh, isn't it?

01:27:03.385 --> 01:27:04.970
-Is Purley posh?
-We're posh.

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:07.514
I still eat meat...
obviously.

01:27:07.597 --> 01:27:09.682
I'm not mental. I love meat.

01:27:09.767 --> 01:27:13.020
But it's easier to prepare
vegetables than meat.

01:27:13.103 --> 01:27:14.521
What else?

01:27:14.604 --> 01:27:18.525
Sadly, I've had to hand the mantle
of Sid back to Dad.

01:27:18.608 --> 01:27:20.235
He's always loved it more than I did.

01:27:20.318 --> 01:27:22.695
And plus, I get out on top.

01:27:23.613 --> 01:27:26.283
Quit while you're ahead.
Champion. Undefeated.

01:27:26.366 --> 01:27:29.787
Best mascot in the world,
ever... that year.

01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:34.958
It's been exciting, you know,
just to be celebrated...

01:27:35.041 --> 01:27:38.795
and to be appreciated
for excellence in my field...

01:27:38.879 --> 01:27:40.047
That's one piece of it,

01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:43.675
and then the other piece is that it has
kicked open some doors for me.

01:27:44.551 --> 01:27:46.553
I got a really great job

01:27:46.636 --> 01:27:51.683
playing Jack the Plumber at trade shows
for a company that makes high-end rivets,

01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:54.812
and it's enabled me to quit my job
as a real estate appraiser.

01:27:56.646 --> 01:27:59.482
I make a third of the money,
but I'm 50% happier, so...

01:27:59.566 --> 01:28:00.901
You do the math.

01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:04.988
The gold would have been nice,
but... next year.

01:28:05.072 --> 01:28:07.074
I think a lot of people say,

01:28:07.157 --> 01:28:10.994
"The glass is half empty,"
and "The glass is half full,"

01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:14.331
and for me, the glass is not half empty,
and the glass is not half full.

01:28:14.414 --> 01:28:16.416
To me, the glass is full.

01:28:17.876 --> 01:28:19.169
It's always full.

01:28:20.670 --> 01:28:26.426
Sadly, my career in sports mascotry
was cut short due to an injury I sustained

01:28:27.344 --> 01:28:28.846
when a pro wrestler came home

01:28:28.929 --> 01:28:32.933
to find me involved in a very lewd act
with his wife and his sister.

01:28:33.016 --> 01:28:36.937
But when I woke up in the emergency room,
I thought to myself,

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:40.773
"Tommy, is this it? Is this your life?
Are you at rock bottom?"

01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:44.945
And that was when the nurse told me
that I also had syphilis.

01:28:45.028 --> 01:28:47.155
Now, I didn't even know
that you could still get syphilis,

01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:48.656
but you can.

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:51.576
And while I'm at it,
if you're a young lady

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:54.621
between the age of 48 and 68
in Manitoba, Canada,

01:28:54.704 --> 01:28:56.539
you probably have it, too,

01:28:56.623 --> 01:28:59.960
and I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for your syphilis.

01:29:00.710 --> 01:29:02.587
But as I lay there in the hospital bed,

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:06.424
nursing my shattered ribs
and my pulsating groin,

01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:10.220
I looked up at the television,
and <i>Highway to Heaven</i> was on...

01:29:11.388 --> 01:29:14.807
and Michael Landon stared back at me
through the screen as if to say,

01:29:14.892 --> 01:29:17.769
"Tommy, become a bloody monk."

01:29:18.728 --> 01:29:20.063
So I did...

01:29:21.064 --> 01:29:22.315
and it's going well.

01:29:23.233 --> 01:29:26.069
Strictly speaking,
I took a vow of silence.

01:29:26.152 --> 01:29:28.113
But you know, fuck it.
