THIS SEASON ON <i> INK MASTER,</i>

00:04.295 --> 00:07.716
18 ARTISTS ARE FIGHTING
TO SETTLE THE SCORE,

00:07.799 --> 00:10.468
PROVING ONCE AND FOR ALL

00:10.552 --> 00:12.929
THAT THEY ARE BETTER
THAN THEIR RIVAL.

00:13.012 --> 00:14.431
- IT WILL BE A BLOODBATH,

00:14.514 --> 00:16.641
AND I'M GOING TO END UP
MOPPING THE FLOOR WITH HIS ASS.

00:16.725 --> 00:17.934
announcer:
ON THE LAST EPISODE...

00:18.017 --> 00:21.312
- THE PERSON YOU HATE THE MOST
IS THE ONE PERSON

00:21.396 --> 00:23.732
YOU NEED THE MOST.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.900
announcer: ENEMIES COLLIDED
WHEN THE ARTISTS WERE FORCED

00:25.984 --> 00:28.737
TO TATTOO WITH THEIR RIVALS.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.155
- DON'T STAND OVER ME.

00:30.238 --> 00:30.947
I WANT YOU TO STAND
THE [bleep] AWAY FROM ME.

00:31.030 --> 00:32.531
- WORRY ABOUT YOUR OWN [bleep].

00:32.615 --> 00:33.533
- YOU CAN TAKE THE SUGGESTION.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.618
- I JUST NEED SOME AIR.

00:35.702 --> 00:36.995
I'M STRESSED, AND I'M PISSED.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.580
IT'S THROWING ME OFF MY GAME.

00:38.663 --> 00:41.958
announcer: THE PRESSURE WAS TOO
MUCH FOR SOME OF THE ARTISTS.

00:42.041 --> 00:43.460
- YOU BLAMED YOUR POOR ARTWORK

00:43.543 --> 00:46.629
AND YOUR POOR TECHNICAL QUALITY
ON BEING NAUSEOUS.

00:46.713 --> 00:47.797
BITCH, YOU CAN'T TATTOO.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.633
- YOU GUYS DIDN'T COME TOGETHER
WELL AS A TEAM.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.677
- THE BACKGROUND--
WHAT THE [bleep]?

00:52.761 --> 00:54.095
- WELL, I KNOW
I COULD HAVE HANDLED IT.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.221
- BUT IT WASN'T
A DO-IT-BY-YOURSELF CHALLENGE.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.932
IT WAS MAKE SMART DECISIONS
FROM THE START.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.477
announcer:
AFTER BRUTAL CRITIQUES,

01:00.560 --> 01:03.938
SIX ARTISTS HAD TO FACE OFF
TO SURVIVE.

01:04.022 --> 01:04.980
- I'M COMING, GUNS BLAZING.

01:05.063 --> 01:07.984
I'M COMING FOR YOU.
- [bleep] TWIT.

01:08.067 --> 01:10.111
announcer: IN THE ELIMINATION,
TY'ESHA, MARK,

01:10.195 --> 01:13.281
AND CAROLINE
WERE THE BOTTOM THREE.

01:13.364 --> 01:14.741
- TY'ESHA.

01:14.824 --> 01:15.825
- LOOKING AT YOUR LETTERING
UP CLOSE,

01:15.909 --> 01:16.951
THERE'S NOT
A SINGLE LOOP OR SWIRL

01:17.035 --> 01:18.870
THAT WE DON'T SEE A HICCUP IN.

01:18.953 --> 01:21.623
- MARK.
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

01:21.706 --> 01:23.041
YOU JUST LOOK NERVOUS.
- THIS IS CRAZY.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.668
THIS IS THE MOST EMBARRASSING
THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

01:25.752 --> 01:26.669
- CAROLINE.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.254
- THE SAME TAN,
BEIGE, SANDALWOOD,

01:28.338 --> 01:30.840
WHATEVER THE [bleep]
YOU WANT TO CALL IT COLOR

01:30.924 --> 01:32.425
THAT YOU JUST PUT
INTO THE SKULL,

01:32.509 --> 01:33.843
IT'S VERY LACKLUSTER.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.138
- CAROLINE, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.478
announcer:
17 ARTISTS REMAIN,

01:43.561 --> 01:48.024
BUT ONLY ONE WILL EARN

IS GONE,

02:48.376 --> 02:49.627

02:49.711 --> 02:52.046

IT'S GOING TO GET HARDER
AND HARDER AS THE WEEKS GO BY.

02:53.381 --> 02:56.092
- I THINK
IT'S GONNA BE CHALLENGING.

02:56.175 --> 02:57.760
- THAT WASN'T THE QUESTION,
THOUGH.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.554
HIS QUESTION WAS,
"ARE YOU UP TO PAR?"

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

SEEING HER GO HOME, IT LIGHTS
A FIRE UNDER MY BUTT AS WELL.

03:15.528 --> 03:16.654
{\an8}- ALL THESE TATTOO ARTISTS

03:16.738 --> 03:18.615
{\an8}HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
THEY GOT THEMSELVES INTO.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.658
THEY THINK IT'S GOING
TO BE SO EASY,

A FEATURE IN <i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,

04:08.748 --> 04:10.541
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

JOE MANGANIELLO.
- YES.

04:24.931 --> 04:28.768
[cheers and applause]

04:28.851 --> 04:30.436
- TATTOO CULTURE'S FASCINATING
TO ME.

04:30.520 --> 04:34.274
{\an8}PEOPLE GET TATTOOS TO ENHANCE
THEIR PHYSICAL APPEARANCE.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.818
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME
BEING JUDGED FOR HOW

04:36.901 --> 04:39.028
I LOOK WITH MY CLOTHES OFF.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.363
I PLAN TO JUDGE THESE ARTISTS
ON WHETHER OR NOT

04:40.446 --> 04:44.701
THEY ARE ABLE TO ACCENTUATE
AND COMPLEMENT THE BODY,

04:44.784 --> 04:46.411
AND IF THEY DON'T,
I'M HERE TO CALL THEM OUT.

04:46.494 --> 04:51.124
- JOE MANGANIELLO
IS SUCH A SEXY BEAST.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.710
{\an8}WEREWOLF, VAMPIRE,
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU ARE.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.921
{\an8}JUST COME HOME WITH ME.
[laughs]

04:57.005 --> 05:00.091
{\an8}- THIS WEEK
WE'RE TESTING YOUR ARTISTRY.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.677
{\an8}- ARTISTRY IS THE ABILITY
TO MAKE ART LOOK GOOD.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.596
{\an8}YOU COULD HAVE
THE BEST APPLIED TATTOO EVER,

05:05.680 --> 05:08.182
{\an8}BUT IF IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD,
IT'S STILL CRAP.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.226
- WE BEGIN
WITH A FLASH CHALLENGE,

05:10.310 --> 05:11.978
A SKILLS TEST
WILL GIVE THE WINNER

05:12.061 --> 05:14.230
AN ADVANTAGE
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

05:14.313 --> 05:17.525
TODAY, YOU MUST BRING A PINUP
TO LIFE.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.029
LET'S MEET YOUR MODELS.

05:21.112 --> 05:21.988
- OH!

05:22.071 --> 05:25.074
- WHAT?
- THIS IS GOING TO BE FUN.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.244
- THERE YOU GO.
- THAT'LL DO IT.

05:28.327 --> 05:29.746
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

05:29.829 --> 05:32.123
THEY ARE BUTT-ASS NAKED.

05:32.206 --> 05:33.583
THIS IS INSANE.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.169
{\an8}THIS CHALLENGE IS GOING
TO BE CRAZY.

05:38.004 --> 05:42.884
{\an8}- I LOVE NAKED MODELS.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.761
{\an8}- USING TEMPTU AIRBRUSH MAKEUP,

05:44.844 --> 05:48.181
{\an8}YOU MUST SHOW ARTISTRY
BY PAINTING REALISTIC CLOTHING

05:48.264 --> 05:51.934
{\an8}ONTO YOUR MODEL THAT PERFECTLY
COMPLEMENTS HER FORM.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.811
{\an8}- I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE
WITH PINUP MODELS,

05:53.895 --> 05:55.229
{\an8}ESPECIALLY FULL BODY.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.523
I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE
IN AIRBRUSHING IN GENERAL.

05:57.607 --> 05:58.733
IT'S JUST NOT GOOD.

05:58.816 --> 06:01.069
- YOUR MODELS HAVE BEEN
RANDOMLY ASSIGNED,

06:01.152 --> 06:02.236
AND EACH OF THEM HAS A PROP

06:02.320 --> 06:04.989
THAT WILL SERVE AS INSPIRATION
FOR YOUR PINUP.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.658
{\an8}- THIS WHOLE FLASH CHALLENGE
WENT FROM REALLY NAKED

06:07.742 --> 06:08.868
{\an8}TO REALLY NERVE-RACKING.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.119
WHAT I'M SCARED OF IS MAKING

06:10.203 --> 06:12.080
THIS NAKED WOMAN
LOOK LIKE A PINUP WITH A THEME.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.957
- YOU HAVE THREE HOURS
TO CREATE A REAL-LIFE PINUP

06:15.041 --> 06:16.125
THAT ILLUSTRATES YOUR ARTISTRY,

06:16.209 --> 06:19.504
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

06:23.382 --> 06:24.175
- ALL RIGHT, COWGIRL.

06:24.258 --> 06:26.636
- OH, BEACH BABE.
- YEP.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.471
- YOU'RE AN ARTIST LIKE MYSELF.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.932
- TODAY, I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR A MASTER OF AN AIRBRUSH.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.643
{\an8}WHAT I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR
IS SOMEBODY WHO CAN COMPLEMENT

06:33.726 --> 06:35.812
{\an8}SOMETHING AS BEAUTIFUL
AS THE FEMALE FIGURE.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.355
{\an8}TATTOOING IS ART.

06:37.438 --> 06:38.773
{\an8}IF YOU DON'T HAVE ARTISTRY, YOU
SHOULDN'T BE IN THE BUSINESS.

06:38.856 --> 06:41.526
{\an8}- THIS IS PROBABLY ONE
OF MY FAVORITE CHALLENGES.

06:41.609 --> 06:44.070
{\an8}- WHAT THE FRIG
DOES A SEXY MAGICIAN LOOK LIKE?

06:44.153 --> 06:45.488
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A SEXY
MAGICIAN OR A MAGICIAN PINUP?

06:45.571 --> 06:49.158
IT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.
THEY WEAR SUITS.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.202
DON'T MIND ME.
I'M JUST FEELING YOUR BUTT.

06:51.285 --> 06:53.579
- RUNNING YOUR MOUTH
LIKE ALWAYS, AIN'T YOU, AARON?

06:53.663 --> 06:55.331
- I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO YOU.

06:55.414 --> 06:56.624
- YOU JUST NEVER SHUT UP.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.793
I CAN'T HELP
BUT HEAR YOUR MOUTH RUNNING.

06:58.876 --> 07:00.253
I WILL BE THE FIRST PERSON

07:00.336 --> 07:02.338
TO RING THAT BELL
AND TO WIN THIS.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.465
{\an8}I'M DEFINITELY HERE TO SAY THAT
I CAN OUTDO A LOT OF PEOPLE.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.472
- TWO HOURS TO GO, EVERYBODY.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.974
TWO MORE HOURS.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.183
- I GOT THE FOOTBALL PLAYER.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.101
{\an8}HOW MANY FOOTBALL PINUPS
DO YOU REALLY SEE?

07:15.184 --> 07:18.312
{\an8}IT'S A MALE SPORT,

07:18.396 --> 07:19.856
BUT I BEAT TY'ESHA
IN THE LAST CHALLENGE,

07:19.939 --> 07:20.815
AND I WILL BEAT HER AGAIN.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.316
TY'ESHA HATES THAT I'M COCKY,

07:22.400 --> 07:25.528
BUT HONESTLY, IT'S NOT MY FAULT
THAT I'M BETTER THAN HER.

07:25.611 --> 07:26.737
TURN THIS WAY FOR ME.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.739
YEP, PERFECT.

07:28.823 --> 07:32.160
- THERE'S TEAMS HERE,
AND SOME OF US HAVE RIVALS,

07:32.243 --> 07:35.037
SO WE ARE KIND OF PITTING
AGAINST EACH OTHER, YOU SEE?

07:35.121 --> 07:36.831
HIM HERE
AND THEN HIM OVER THERE,

07:36.914 --> 07:38.040
THEY'RE BOTH DOING RED APRONS
ON THEIR MODELS.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.877
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY FUNNY
FOR THE JUDGES.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.547
{\an8}- I WAS IN THE BOTTOM
OF THE FACE-OFF TATTOO.

07:44.630 --> 07:45.548
{\an8}RYAN BEAT ME.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.049
{\an8}RYAN IS THE LAST GUY
IN THE WORLD

07:47.133 --> 07:49.010
{\an8}I WANT TO EVER LOSE TO.
THIS IS CRAZY.

07:49.093 --> 07:51.262
THIS IS THE MOST EMBARRASSING
THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.723
I KNOW MY HATERS
ARE VERY HAPPY RIGHT NOW.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.558
THIS WHOLE COMPETITION
RATTLED MY CAGE.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.602
IT GOT ME NERVOUS.
I GOT TO SHAKE IT OFF.

07:57.685 --> 07:58.728
I'M GOING TO COME BACK
EVEN STRONGER.

07:58.811 --> 07:59.896
I'M A FIGHTER.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.105
- IS THAT ONE
OF SANTA'S HELPERS?

08:01.189 --> 08:02.190
- GIRL LOOKING RIGHT.

08:02.273 --> 08:03.608
{\an8}MY MODEL'S TURNING OUT DOPE.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.276
{\an8}MARK'S GOING TO DO THE WORST
IN THIS CHALLENGE

08:05.359 --> 08:07.653
{\an8}JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TEACH
AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.576
- ONE HOUR REMAINING, EVERYBODY.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.369
ONE HOUR REMAINING.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.204
- I'M JUST GONNA
SPEND THAT WHOLE HOUR ON THESE.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.581
I THINK THE JUDGES LIKE DETAILS,

08:18.664 --> 08:19.874
SO I'M PUTTING IN
LOTS OF DETAIL.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.834
{\an8}LAST TIME I COMPETED,
WE HAD AN AIRBRUSH CHALLENGE.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.795
{\an8}- AS FAR AS TIME, IT FEELS LIKE
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.548
{\an8}- I SPENT MORE OF MY TIME
TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK FURRY

08:27.632 --> 08:29.884
{\an8}THAN I DID TRYING
TO COVER MORE SPACE.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.302
{\an8}I NEED TO PROVE MYSELF.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.553
RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE,
I'M BRINGING THE DETAIL

08:32.636 --> 08:36.890
AND THE ARTISTRY
TO ONE PAIR OF CUTOFF JEANS.

08:36.974 --> 08:37.515
I'M BRINGING IT.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.268
- HEY, HEY, JASON.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.938
PEOPLE TEND TO WEAR SHIRTS TOO,
YOU KNOW?

08:42.020 --> 08:44.565
YOU TRYING TO GET THIS GIRL
ARRESTED, YOU PERVERT?

08:44.649 --> 08:46.525
PUT A SHIRT ON HER.
- NOT IN NEW YORK.

08:46.609 --> 08:49.487
WE DON'T NEED A SHIRT
IN NEW YORK.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.325
- CAREFUL WITH YOUR MOVEMENT.

08:54.408 --> 08:55.910
{\an8}I'M GETTING
A LITTLE MORE OVER-SPRAY

08:55.993 --> 08:57.536
{\an8}THAN I WANTED TO
WITH THE AIRBRUSH.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.829
TRY NOT TO MAKE
QUICK MOVEMENTS

08:58.913 --> 09:00.248
'CAUSE YOU'RE SHAKING
LIKE CRAZY,

09:00.331 --> 09:01.666
AND I KNOW
IT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE COLD.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.709
MY MODEL IS HAVING TROUBLE
STANDING STILL,

09:03.793 --> 09:07.129
AND IT'S MAKING THINGS
A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.882
{\an8}- TIM'S DEFINITELY DISPLAYING
TERRIBLE APPLICATION ON THIS.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.509
{\an8}YOU BETTER STEP IT UP
IF YOU'RE EVEN GOING

09:11.592 --> 09:14.262
{\an8}TO COME CLOSE TO BEATING ME
IN THIS COMPETITION.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.765
{\an8}- MY MODEL IS A PIRATE PINUP.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.642
{\an8}PIRATES ARE VERY ORNATE.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.143
JAYVO'S DOING A SAILOR GIRL.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.853
YOU THROW AN ANCHOR ON THERE,
BLUE AND WHITE.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.689
EVERYTHING'S EASY.

09:24.772 --> 09:27.358
I MEAN WE'VE BEEN [bleep] AT
EACH OTHER'S THROATS FOR YEARS.

09:27.441 --> 09:30.152
HE'S BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE
AND ANGRY TOWARDS ME.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.863
JAYVO IS UPSET
BECAUSE HE WASTED SO MANY YEARS

09:32.947 --> 09:35.616
NOT TRYING,
THAT HE'S NOT TO MY SKILL LEVEL.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.910
HE'S DEFINITELY JEALOUS OF ME.

09:37.994 --> 09:41.872
I'M GONNA BEAT THE CRAP
OUT OF HIM.

09:41.956 --> 09:47.169
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.671
THAT IS IT, NO MORE PAINTING.

09:48.754 --> 09:52.425
- I THINK IT
LOOKS PRETTY DARN GOOD, GIRLIE.

09:52.508 --> 09:53.509
- LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.

09:53.592 --> 09:55.428
I FEEL GOOD.
I FEEL CONFIDENT.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.513
{\an8}THE SHORTS LOOK GREAT.
- I WOULD HUG YOU,

09:57.596 --> 09:58.889
{\an8}BUT I WOULD NOT WANT
ALL THAT PAINT ALL OVER ME.

09:58.973 --> 10:02.059
- THERE'S NOTHING HOT
ABOUT JOSH'S DESIGN.

10:02.143 --> 10:05.438
DOING THIS BIG, LARGE,
ORANGE JACKET SQUARED-OFF THING,

10:05.521 --> 10:09.233
YOU HAVE TAKEN THIS WOMAN'S BODY
AND JUST MADE HER INTO A BOX.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.860
- HIGH FIVE.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.862
- I GOT THIS.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.074
{\an8}- THIS CHALLENGE ISN'T OVER YET.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.534
{\an8}- WHAT?

10:18.617 --> 10:20.244
{\an8}- YOU ARE A [bleep] TATTOOER.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.038
{\an8}- [bleep] YOU BOTH.

10:30.504 --> 10:32.798
- ALL RIGHT, ARTISTS,
IT'S TIME TO CRITIQUE YOUR WORK.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.550
ANGEL, LET'S START WITH YOU.

10:34.633 --> 10:35.926
- AS FAR AS THE ARTISTRY GOES,

10:36.010 --> 10:37.970
I THINK THIS IS ONE
OF THE NICER ONES IN THE ROOM.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.388
YOU KEPT IT VERY SIMPLE.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.974
IT LOOKS REALLY BELIEVABLE.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.392
- CHRIS.
- WITHOUT THE HAT AND THE BROOM,

10:43.476 --> 10:47.688
I MIGHT THINK IT WAS A WOMAN
MORPHING INTO A RAVEN OR CROW.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.273
- MAYBE SHE'S BEEN
TAR AND FEATHERED

10:49.357 --> 10:50.524
BECAUSE SHE'S A WITCH.

10:50.608 --> 10:54.570
IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING.

10:54.653 --> 10:55.738
- JULIA.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.531
- THE COLORS
WERE THE BIGGEST COMPLEMENT.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.742
IT GIVES US
THE OBVIOUS BEAT COP FEEL.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.077
IT IS A LITTLE MESSY,

11:01.160 --> 11:02.995
BUT WE STILL KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GOING FOR.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.372
- ROBBIE.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.498
- AS FAR AS THE ARTISTRY GOES
HERE,

11:05.581 --> 11:07.750
THE DETAILS
YOU HAVE IN HERE ARE VERY MESSY,

11:07.833 --> 11:11.337
BUT FOR CREATIVITY,
YOU GET SOME POINTS.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.881
- THANK YOU.
- JAYVO.

11:13.964 --> 11:16.550
- YOU HAVE SOME MESS, SOME
OVER-SPRAY, SOME BLUE SMEAR.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.095
THIS DEFINITELY TAKES AWAY
FROM THE OVERALL DESIGN.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.513
THE ANCHOR'S VERY CLEAN.

11:20.596 --> 11:23.766
I WISH WE SAW SOME CLEAN LINES
ON THE REST OF IT.

11:23.849 --> 11:24.934
- TY'ESHA.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.352
- I REALLY LIKE THE LAYOUT
OF THIS ONE.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.770
FROM ACROSS THE ROOM,
IT LOOKS PRETTY CLEAN

11:27.853 --> 11:29.688
AND HAS SOME DEFINITION
IN THE SHADING.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.023
IT'S JUST, WHEN YOU GET CLOSE,

11:31.107 --> 11:33.818
YOU HAVE SOME LINE WORK
THAT'S JUST REAL MESSY.

11:34.276 --> 11:36.529
- LT.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.697
- AS FAR AS ARTISTRY GOES,
THESE PADS ON HER THIGHS,

11:38.781 --> 11:41.075
THEY'RE SO DIFFERENT
FROM ONE LEG TO THE NEXT.

11:41.158 --> 11:41.867
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE
TO PAY ATTENTION

11:41.951 --> 11:43.911
AND KEEP THOSE DETAILS THE SAME.

11:43.994 --> 11:44.453
- LT'S GOING HOME.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.414
HIS ART SUCKS.

11:46.497 --> 11:49.875
{\an8}HE DOESN'T HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE HERE.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.001
- RYAN.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.545
- EVERY GUY FANTASIZES

11:52.628 --> 11:54.296
ABOUT THE GIRL COOKING WITH
THE APRON ON AND NOTHING ELSE,

11:54.380 --> 11:55.965
AND I THINK
YOU'VE DEFINITELY ACHIEVED IT.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.717
NOT 1 INCH OF THE DESIGN
ISN'T DETAILED.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.971
I THINK IT'S GREAT.
- MARK.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.306
- THE WAY YOU APPROACHED THIS
IS A LITTLE CRAZY

12:04.390 --> 12:05.891
BECAUSE IT LOOKS REAL CARTOONY.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.144
A LITTLE BIT OVERRUN ON THAT,
BUT OVERALL,

12:08.227 --> 12:11.063
I LIKE THE WAY IT CAME OUT.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.773
- CLEEN.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.567
- THE SEX APPEAL DEFINITELY
COMES THROUGH, BUT THE COLORS

12:14.650 --> 12:16.652
ARE NOT NECESSARILY WHAT I WOULD
EQUATE WITH SEXY COLORS.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.821
- YOU DEFINITELY GOT
A TOUGH STRAW.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.364
WITHOUT THE RULER AND THE APPLE

12:20.448 --> 12:21.490
AND THE GLASSES,
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

12:21.574 --> 12:24.618
IT'S JUST KIND OF HARD TO READ.
- TIM.

12:24.702 --> 12:25.828
- AS FAR AS ARTISTRY GOES,

12:25.911 --> 12:28.205
YOU REALLY LOST IT ON THE WRISTS
AND THE ANKLES.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.165
IT LOOKS LIKE A MESS.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.958
- WHAT IS THE TOP?
- WEAVED LEAVES.

12:31.041 --> 12:34.420
- FROM HERE, THEY LOOK LIKE
ENDS OF WATERMELONS.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.839
{\an8}- TIM IS DEFINITELY DOING

12:36.922 --> 12:37.840
{\an8}EXACTLY WHAT
I EXPECTED HIM TO DO.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.176
HE CAME HERE
TO FALL ON HIS FACE,

12:40.259 --> 12:42.136
AND HE'S DOING IT.
- EMILY.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.680
- I REALLY LIKE THE BORDER
THAT YOU DID AROUND THE OUTSIDE.

12:44.763 --> 12:45.723
IT MAKES THE BLUE JUMP OUT.

12:45.806 --> 12:48.100
MY FAVORITE PART OF IT
IS ACTUALLY

12:48.184 --> 12:49.977
IT RIDES IN THE BACK
OF THE SUIT,

12:50.060 --> 12:51.353
HAS THAT VERY VINTAGE FEEL,

12:51.437 --> 12:54.440
BUT YET FLOWS NICELY
ON THE BODY.

12:54.523 --> 12:55.608
- AARON.

12:55.691 --> 12:57.234
- WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN
A BENEFIT TO YOU IS IF

12:57.318 --> 12:59.862
YOU WOULD HAVE JUST NOT COVERED
SO MUCH OF HER, MORE BELLY,

12:59.945 --> 13:01.822
AND THEN THOSE COOL LAPELS WOULD
HAVE SHOWED OFF A LOT MORE.

13:04.241 --> 13:06.243
- ERIK.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.328
- THIS ONE'S DEFINITELY
A TOUGH ONE.

13:07.411 --> 13:09.288
WHAT DO YOU DO
TO MAKE A SEXY BARBER?

13:09.371 --> 13:11.790
IF YOU'RE GONNA DO AN IMAGE
LIKE A COMB AND SCISSORS,

13:11.874 --> 13:12.958
YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET

13:13.042 --> 13:14.043
A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAILED
THAN THAT.

13:14.126 --> 13:17.004
THAT COMB IS PRETTY JANKY.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.547
- DON.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.592
- I DON'T FEEL LIKE THE SHORTS
FIT LIKE REAL SHORTS.

13:21.675 --> 13:25.846
YOU GOT A LITTLE OUT OF CONTROL
WITH THE WHITE FRINGE.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.389
- JASON.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.641
- TALKING ABOUT ARTISTRY,

13:28.724 --> 13:30.643
JUST THE FRAYS
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SHORTS,

13:30.726 --> 13:32.228
THE SHINE ON THE BUTTONS,

13:32.311 --> 13:34.146
THE DETAIL IN THE THREADING,

13:34.230 --> 13:39.276
PLUS YOU DID A PHENOMENAL JOB OF
FITTING THE DESIGN TO THE BODY.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.778
- NOBODY HAS ACHIEVED
THIS AMOUNT OF DETAIL.

13:40.861 --> 13:45.282
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.742
- JOSHUA.

13:46.825 --> 13:48.077
- YOU DID A NICE JOB
MAKING THE SKIRT LOOK

13:48.160 --> 13:49.537
LIKE IT'S FLOWING ACROSS
THE BODY.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.621
I LOVE THE PLEATS.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.872
AS FAR AS THE ORANGE COAT,
KIND OF STRANGE.

13:51.956 --> 13:55.334
COULD HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAILED.

13:55.417 --> 13:56.752
{\an8}- IF THIS IS A PRECURSOR

13:56.835 --> 13:58.587
{\an8}TO JOSH'S NEW DESIGN
AND DRAWING ABILITY,

13:58.671 --> 14:02.925
{\an8}I'M NOT WORRIED AT ALL.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.511
- TODAY, WE ASKED YOU
TO SHOW ARTISTRY

14:05.594 --> 14:08.013
BY CREATING REAL-LIFE PINUPS,

14:08.097 --> 14:10.558
BUT THIS CHALLENGE
ISN'T OVER YET.

14:12.601 --> 14:17.690
WE ARE MOVING DIRECTLY INTO
THE NEXT ELIMINATION TATTOO.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.942
- WHAT?

14:20.025 --> 14:21.652
- THEY'RE NOT EVEN GONNA
GIVE ME THE WIN?

14:21.735 --> 14:23.487
EVERYBODY IN THIS COMPETITION

14:23.571 --> 14:25.447
KNOWS THAT I AM THE WINNER
OF THIS CHALLENGE.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.950
I FEEL ROBBED.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.327
- USING THE MODEL YOU'VE JUST
PAINTED AS YOUR REFERENCE,

14:30.411 --> 14:34.248
YOU MUST ALL TATTOO A PINUP.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.583
- PINUPS ARE HARD ALREADY.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.876
{\an8}THESE THINGS HAVE HANDS, FEET,
AND FACES,

14:37.960 --> 14:39.295
{\an8}AND THE JUDGES RIP
THOSE APART EVERY SINGLE TIME.

14:39.378 --> 14:43.132
AND NOW I HAVE TO USE THIS
CRAPPY DESIGN AS MY REFERENCE?

14:43.215 --> 14:44.800
THIS [bleep] BLOWS, MAN.

14:44.883 --> 14:47.636
- THIS SEASON
IN EVERY ELIMINATION TATTOO,

14:47.720 --> 14:49.930
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE TATTOOING
THE SAME SUBJECT MATTER

14:50.014 --> 14:53.726
HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH AT LEAST ONE OTHER ARTIST,

14:53.809 --> 14:55.978
GIVING
AN APPLES-TO-APPLES COMPARISON.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.938
- IT'S PRETTY INTENSE.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.148
IT'S SCARY TO GO HEAD-TO-HEAD
AGAINST ANOTHER PERSON.

14:59.231 --> 15:02.484
{\an8}IT COULD BE THEIR WEAKNESS
AND YOUR STRONG POINT

15:02.568 --> 15:04.445
{\an8}OR YOUR WEAKNESS
AND THEIR STRONG POINT,

15:04.528 --> 15:07.740
AND THIS TIME, WE'RE GOING
HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH EVERYONE.

15:07.823 --> 15:10.909
- YOU'LL BE JUDGED
BY OLIVER PECK, CHRIS NUÑEZ,

15:10.993 --> 15:12.828
JOE MANGANIELLO,
AND MYSELF,

15:12.911 --> 15:16.081
BUT WE'RE NOT YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

15:16.165 --> 15:19.585
EACH WEEK, YOU WILL ALSO
BE JUDGED BY AMERICA.

15:19.668 --> 15:22.129
VIEWERS AT HOME WILL SCOUR
EVERY DETAIL

15:22.212 --> 15:25.132
OF YOUR ELIMINATION TATTOOS
AT INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM

15:25.215 --> 15:28.927
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

15:29.011 --> 15:32.056
AMERICA'S VOTE
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT

15:32.139 --> 15:34.141
AT THE LIVE FINALE.

15:34.224 --> 15:35.726
YOU'VE HEARD OUR CRITIQUES.

15:35.809 --> 15:39.188
AS YOU TRANSFORM YOUR PINUPS
FROM REAL LIFE INTO TATTOOS,

15:39.271 --> 15:42.399
IT'S UP TO YOU
TO IMPROVE YOUR DESIGNS.

15:42.483 --> 15:45.861
REMEMBER,
YOU'RE BEING JUDGED ON ARTISTRY.

15:45.944 --> 15:47.071
- PINUPS ARE VERY DIFFICULT.

15:47.154 --> 15:47.863
{\an8}IF YOU DON'T USE
YOUR OWN ARTISTRY

15:47.946 --> 15:50.115
{\an8}TO MAKE THE PINUP LOOK SEXY,

15:50.199 --> 15:51.659
{\an8}IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK OUT GOOD.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.036
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.539
- HI.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.249
[indistinct chatter]

15:59.333 --> 16:02.294
- YOUR HUMAN CANVASES
HAVE BEEN RANDOMLY ASSIGNED,

16:02.378 --> 16:04.505
AND YOU HAVE THE REST OF
THE NIGHT TO CONSULT WITH THEM.

16:04.588 --> 16:05.798
AS YOU KNOW,

16:05.881 --> 16:07.758
IT'S VITAL TO YOUR SURVIVAL
IN THE COMPETITION

16:07.841 --> 16:10.094
TO MAKE YOUR CANVAS HAPPY
BECAUSE,

16:10.177 --> 16:12.262
AFTER EVERY ELIMINATION TATTOO,

16:12.346 --> 16:14.431
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

16:14.515 --> 16:16.225
WILL VOTE ON THE ONE TATTOO

16:16.308 --> 16:18.227
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST

16:18.310 --> 16:20.270
AND PUT ONE ARTIST
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

16:22.815 --> 16:26.026
TOMORROW, YOU WILL HAVE
SIX HOURS TO TATTOO A PINUP.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.862
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.116
GOOD LUCK.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.242
- WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING
WITH THE COWGIRL THEME?

16:33.325 --> 16:35.577
- YEAH.
- I DON'T LIKE THE NEW SCHOOL,

16:35.661 --> 16:36.412
LIKE, WITH THE BIG EYES.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.289
- MAYBE A BLACK PENCIL SKIRT?

16:39.373 --> 16:41.709
{\an8}- THIS IS A PINUP CHALLENGE.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR BEAUTY.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.043
THAT EQUALS ARTISTRY.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.963
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE TASTE
AND THE VISION

16:46.046 --> 16:48.590
TO MAKE YOUR PINUP THE MOST
STUNNING WOMAN IN THE ROOM.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.510
- WE CAN REALLY ACCENTUATE THIS.
BRING THIS OUT.

16:51.593 --> 16:52.553
- I WAS GOING TO GET IT
RIGHT IN HERE.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.471
- AND SO THAT'S THE ISSUE
IS THAT

16:54.555 --> 16:56.932
THAT'S A 15- OR 20-HOUR TATTOO.
I'VE DONE RIB CAGES.

16:57.015 --> 16:58.308
I KNOW WHAT THE [bleep]
IT TAKES.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.935
IF YOU WANT HER TO LOOK GOOD,

17:00.018 --> 17:01.103
IT'S JUST NOT THE RIGHT THING
TO DO IN THIS COMPETITION.

17:01.186 --> 17:04.272
HE WANTS IT ON HIS RIBS.
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

17:04.356 --> 17:05.607
{\an8}I'M NOT PUTTING IT ON YOUR RIBS.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.152
{\an8}WE'RE GOING TO MOVE IT SOMEWHERE
THAT MAKES SENSE.

17:08.234 --> 17:10.738
NOW THIS TATTOO HERE, AND IT HAS
THIS NICE, WIDE SPOT--

17:10.820 --> 17:12.114
I MEAN, THIS REALLY WOULD BE
A BEAUTIFUL SPOT FOR ME.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.031
I CONSIDER MYSELF
THE ULTIMATE SALESMAN.

17:14.116 --> 17:16.117
MY GRANDFATHER IS
A USED CAR SALESMAN.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.787
MY FATHER IS
A USED CAR SALESMAN.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.290
IF ANYBODY'S GOING TO CONVINCE
A CANVAS TO MOVE A TATTOO

17:21.373 --> 17:22.790
FROM ONE SPOT TO ANOTHER ONE...

17:22.875 --> 17:25.669
- MY OTHER POSITION
WAS THE CALF.

17:25.752 --> 17:26.920
- IT'S GONNA BE ME.
THAT'S GREAT.

17:27.003 --> 17:28.505
- IS THAT A GOOD SPOT?
- LET'S DO THE CALF.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.007
- WE'LL DO THE CALF.
- PERFECT.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.301
{\an8}- TATTOOING ON THE RIBS
ISN'T THAT HARD.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.802
TURN THIS WAY.
TURN, STOP.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.930
MY CANVAS WANTS IT ON HIS RIBS,

17:37.014 --> 17:38.348
BRING IT ON, I'M READY.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.559
- INSTEAD OF THAT UP TOP,
MAKE IT ONE FLOWER,

17:40.642 --> 17:41.977
HIBISCUS.
- OKAY.

17:42.060 --> 17:44.480
- THE HIP STICKING OUT,
HER HOLDING THE UKULELE,

17:44.563 --> 17:45.731
THAT FRONT FOOT
CURLED LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW,

17:45.814 --> 17:49.151
WHICHEVER WAY THAT GRASS SKIRT'S
COMING OFF,

17:49.234 --> 17:51.653
I WANT IT TO BE
TOWARDS MY CROTCH.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.198
{\an8}- MY CANVAS IS BEING
A STRAIGHT PRICK.

17:54.281 --> 17:55.324
{\an8}I THOUGHT IT WAS SLIPPING.
- NO, NO, I WANT IT...

17:55.407 --> 17:57.534
- I TOOK SLIPPING ORIGINALLY,
BUT OKAY.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.077
- I WANT IT TO BE
TOTALLY UNTIED,

17:59.161 --> 18:00.370
LIKE IF IT'S FALLING OFF,

18:00.454 --> 18:02.247
AND YOU CAPTURE THAT MOMENT.

18:02.331 --> 18:03.457
- HE WANTS ME TO MAKE
HER THICKER.

18:03.540 --> 18:04.792
HE WANTS ME TO MAKE
HER MORE BENT.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.001
HE'S A CONTROL FREAK.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.003
- AND IT DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE TO BE COCONUTS.

18:08.086 --> 18:09.713
- IF THIS GUY
CAME INTO MY SHOP AT HOME,

18:09.797 --> 18:11.965
THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY
I WOULD TATTOO THIS GUY.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.426
I WOULD TELL HIM
TO [bleep] OFF.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.399
- HEY, HOW YOU DOING?
- YOU READY FOR THIS?

18:29.483 --> 18:30.609
- OH, YEAH.
- CHECK IT OUT, BRO.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.528
WHAT YOU THINK?

18:32.611 --> 18:34.196
- GOOD TO SEE YOU. CHECK IT OUT.
- WHAT'S UP, MAN? ALL RIGHT.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.907
- GOT THE DRAWING RIGHT HERE,
SO YOU CAN SEE IT.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.158
- THE FACE.

18:38.242 --> 18:41.411
I'M JUST REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT THE FACE, MAN,

18:41.495 --> 18:42.663
LIKE, THAT NOSE.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.373
- I THINK IT'S JUST
THE PENCIL LINE DRAWING

18:44.456 --> 18:45.791
THAT'S KIND OF MESSING YOU UP.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.960
- I JUST WANT HER FACE
TO BE FEMININE, YOU KNOW?

18:48.043 --> 18:50.796
- MY CANVAS IS BEING
A STRAIGHT-UP [bleep].

18:50.879 --> 18:52.506
{\an8}THIS CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE
A NIGHTMARE ALL THE WAY AROUND.

18:52.589 --> 18:56.385
- I DON'T WANT TO HAVE, LIKE,
A DUDE IN A GRASS SKIRT.

18:56.468 --> 18:59.680
- YOU JUST GOT TO LET ME
SHADE IT AND DO MY JOB.

19:11.525 --> 19:15.529
- ALL RIGHT. YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO A PINUP.

19:15.612 --> 19:19.783
IF YOUR TATTOO ISN'T GORGEOUS,
YOU'LL BE PACKING YOUR MACHINES.

19:19.867 --> 19:23.328
AND YOUR TIME BEGINS NOW.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.122
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET IT ON.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.164
- LET'S GET ROCKIN'.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.292
{\an8}- THE TRICKY THING
ABOUT DOING PINUP GIRLS,

19:28.375 --> 19:30.252
{\an8}MISTAKES REALLY STAND OUT.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.254
IF THE PROPORTION IS OFF,
YOU NOTICE.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.256
IF A HAND IS WRONG,
YOU NOTICE.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.384
IF THE FACE IS NOT CUTE,
IT STICKS OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.803
IF YOU CAN'T SHOW US
SIMPLE ARTISTRY SKILLS,

19:39.887 --> 19:42.264
YOU'RE GOING TO FAIL
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

19:42.347 --> 19:42.723
- READY FOR SOME HELL?

19:42.806 --> 19:43.891
- YEP.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.100
{\an8}- THE RIBS ARE VERY SENSITIVE,

19:45.183 --> 19:47.436
{\an8}BUT IN MY MIND,
IT'S A CHALLENGE.

19:47.519 --> 19:51.398
I'M HERE WITH A PURPOSE.
I HAVE TO PROVE I'M THE BEST.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.321
- I'M SORRY, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.780
YOUR VOICE IS TOO RASPY.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.866
- HERE, THAT'S FOR YOU
WITH A BOW TIE ON IT.

20:08.707 --> 20:09.917
- JASON, ARE YOU HERE TO LEARN?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.335
- I'M HERE TO WIN.

20:11.418 --> 20:12.920
I'M HERE TO BE
THE [bleep] INK MASTER.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.254
GET IN LINE BECAUSE I'M NEXT.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.380
{\an8}- LAST TIME I COMPETED,

20:15.464 --> 20:16.548
{\an8}I WAS IN THE BOTTOM
FOR THE PINUP CHALLENGE.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.301
{\an8}- THE BROWN OUTLINE
ON THIS THING WAS A MISS.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.345
{\an8}THIS TATTOO
JUST LOOKS SO UNFINISHED.

20:21.428 --> 20:22.804
{\an8}- I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH
THIS WHOLE ENTIRE COMPETITION

20:22.888 --> 20:23.972
{\an8}SHOWING SOMETHING
THAT I DON'T DO AT HOME.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.641
{\an8}- WHY WOULD YOU COME HERE?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:25.724 --> 20:26.934
{\an8}- WHY WOULD YOU COME COMPETE

20:27.017 --> 20:28.769
{\an8}IF ALL YOU DO IS WHAT YOU DO
IN YOUR LITTLE BOX?

20:28.852 --> 20:31.647
{\an8}IF YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO WIN,
THEN TRY TO WIN.

20:31.730 --> 20:35.943
- BEING ON THE BOTTOM DROVE ME
TO BE THE ARTIST THAT I AM NOW.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.070
I'VE PERSONALLY TAKEN
ON THE CHALLENGE

20:38.153 --> 20:39.947
OF LEARNING THESE PINUPS,
MASTERING THEM,

20:40.030 --> 20:41.448
AND I'M HERE
TO VINDICATE MYSELF.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.492
- FOUR HOURS REMAINING,
EVERYBODY.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.911
FOUR MORE HOURS.

20:48.246 --> 20:50.457
- YOU ABOUT TO START?
- YEP.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.042
- GREAT, JUST ABOUT FINISHED
WITH MY LINE WORK.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.587
- YOU'RE A TERRIBLE PERSON.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.215
- MAMA DIDN'T RAISE NO FOOL,
GIRL.

20:58.298 --> 21:00.759
{\an8}I HAD A FOOTBALL PLAYER MODEL,
AND I CONVINCED MY CANVAS

21:00.842 --> 21:02.844
{\an8}TO CHANGE IT
TO A MILITARY STYLE PINUP.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.222
{\an8}THEY'RE SEXIER--I CAN SHOW
MORE ARTISTRY IN THAT.

21:05.305 --> 21:06.848
{\an8}I'M READY.
I'M HUNGRY.

21:06.932 --> 21:10.727
{\an8}$100,000 IS ON THE LINE,
AND I'M GETTING THAT MONEY.

21:10.811 --> 21:12.896
{\an8}- THAT'S DIFFERENT.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.524
{\an8}LT HAS THE WORST TATTOO
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

21:15.607 --> 21:16.191
{\an8}HIS LINES ARE SHAKY.

21:16.274 --> 21:18.026
IT'S SCRATCHY.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.070
HIS LACK OF EXPERIENCE
IS OBVIOUS.

21:20.153 --> 21:22.614
HE DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE.

21:24.533 --> 21:25.617
- TRY NOT TO HAVE
THEM QUICK, LITTLE TWITCHES.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.202
- I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MESS UP THAT ASS.

21:27.285 --> 21:29.162
- I'M NOT GOING
TO MESS UP NOTHING

21:29.246 --> 21:30.706
UNLESS YOU MAKE
A QUICK-ASS MOVEMENT,

21:30.789 --> 21:31.748
AND THAT'S WHAT I DON'T WANT.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.250
MY CANVAS' CONSTANT MOVEMENT

21:33.333 --> 21:36.211
IS NOT ALLOWING ME TO GET
THE DELICATE DETAILS NEEDED.

21:36.294 --> 21:38.547
HE'S BASICALLY CAUSING ME
TO PLAY FIX-UP

21:38.630 --> 21:40.924
BECAUSE HE WON'T SIT STILL
AND SHUT UP.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.134
I KNOW
IT'S A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE,

21:42.217 --> 21:44.386
BUT YOU'RE VERY CLOSE
TO HAVING A BREAK.

21:44.469 --> 21:45.637
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

21:45.721 --> 21:47.389
- JUST BUILDING IT UP.
- YOU STILL SHAKING?

21:47.472 --> 21:49.599
- NO, I'M NOT SHAKING.
COME ON, NOW.

21:49.683 --> 21:53.228
{\an8}- THIS THING IS BEAT.
THE FACE IS INCREDIBLY BAD.

21:53.311 --> 21:56.189
I THINK TIM'S DROPPING THE BALL.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.233
- ONE HOUR REMAINING, EVERYBODY.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.694
FINAL HOUR.

22:06.324 --> 22:07.409
- GOT ENOUGH BLACK
IN THAT THING?

22:07.492 --> 22:09.411
- [bleep] YEAH.

22:09.494 --> 22:10.829
- WHAT'S GOING DOWN?

22:10.912 --> 22:11.913
- NOTHING AS BIG AS THIS.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.331
HOLY [bleep].

22:13.415 --> 22:14.708
- GOT MY WORK CUT OUT FOR ME.

22:14.791 --> 22:16.543
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT THE TIME TICKING ON ME.

22:16.626 --> 22:18.295
{\an8}DO I DETAIL OUT THESE SECTIONS,

22:18.378 --> 22:20.547
{\an8}AND THIS GIRL GOES HOME
WITH AN UNFINISHED TATTOO,

22:20.630 --> 22:22.674
{\an8}OR DO I JUST CRAM
A BUNCH OF INK IN HERE

22:22.758 --> 22:24.593
{\an8}AND LET IT LOOK LIKE
A COMPLETE TATTOO?

22:24.676 --> 22:26.887
I SHOULD'VE GONE
A LOT SMALLER.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.972
I MAY HAVE SCREWED MYSELF
ON THIS ONE.

22:29.056 --> 22:32.142
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT,

22:32.225 --> 22:34.644
SEVEN, SIX,

22:34.728 --> 22:37.147
FIVE, FOUR,

22:37.230 --> 22:39.858
THREE, TWO, ONE.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.485
THAT IS IT.
MACHINES DOWN.

22:41.568 --> 22:42.611
NO MORE TATTOOING.

22:42.694 --> 22:45.197
- ALL RIGHT!

22:45.280 --> 22:48.033
- GO AHEAD.
TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

22:48.116 --> 22:50.160
- OH, WOW.
- THERE'S YOUR LOVELY LADY.

22:50.243 --> 22:52.120
- I LOVE IT.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.955
- THAT'S AWESOME, MAN.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.874
I'M SO GLAD
WE DECIDED TO CHANGE.

22:55.957 --> 22:57.167
- THANK YOU, MAN.
APPRECIATE IT, MAN, THANK YOU.

22:57.250 --> 23:01.129
- AHH.
CHECK THAT BAD BOY OUT.

23:01.213 --> 23:04.174
- SHE'S DEFINITELY DANCING
IN THE WIND.

23:04.257 --> 23:06.676
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE NOT
GOING TO SEND TIM LEES HOME

23:06.760 --> 23:08.011
{\an8}FOR DOING THIS TATTOO.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.305
WHEN YOU HAVE EYES
AND MOUTH AND LIPS AND NOSE

23:10.388 --> 23:13.225
THAT ARE JUST SMASHED IN, THEN
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FIX THAT?

23:13.308 --> 23:17.354
THIS GUY IS PERMANENTLY [bleep]
UP FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.818
{\an8}- IF YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU DID YOUR BEST TATTOO TODAY,

23:22.901 --> 23:23.443
{\an8}THEN GET READY TO GO HOME.

23:23.527 --> 23:26.279
{\an8}- YOU MOTHER[bleep].

23:32.828 --> 23:36.081
- THERE'S A FEW TATTOOS
THAT ARE PRETTY [bleep].

23:36.164 --> 23:38.083
I MEAN, TIM,
YOUR FACE WAS JACKED.

23:38.166 --> 23:39.793
THAT PIG NOSE.

23:39.876 --> 23:42.170
THE OVERALL DRAWING WAS--
- NOT MY CHOICE ON THAT.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.463
THAT WAS THE DUDE
GOING BACK AND FORTH.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.423
{\an8}- YEAH, BUT THE HAND WAS GOOFY.

23:45.507 --> 23:46.883
{\an8}- I'M NOT EVEN GOING
TO SIT HERE AND EXPLAIN MYSELF.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.176
MY DUDE WAS A PAIN IN THE ASS
TO WORK WITH.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.261
- YOU'RE BLAMING IT
ON THE CLIENT...

23:49.344 --> 23:50.929
- I'M NOT BLAMING IT
ON THE CLIENT.

23:51.012 --> 23:52.514
- YOU KNOW, BACK WHEN YOU DID
WORK AT THE SHOP, YOU KNOW,

23:52.597 --> 23:53.932
YOU ALWAYS HAD THESE EXCUSES.

23:54.015 --> 23:54.724
- I'M NOT GIVING EXCUSES.

23:54.808 --> 23:56.518
- THIS IS THE OLD TIM LEES,

23:56.601 --> 23:58.812
MAKING EXCUSES
WHY HIS TATTOOS LOOK LIKE CRAP.

23:58.895 --> 23:59.563
DUDE, ADMIT IT.

23:59.646 --> 24:00.772
YOU DID A [bleep] TATTOO.

24:00.856 --> 24:03.900
- WHATEVER.
- YOU CAN'T DO A [bleep]-UP FACE

24:03.984 --> 24:06.653
AND A [bleep]-UP HAND
AND A WEIRD-ASS POSE...

24:06.736 --> 24:07.988
- WHATEVER.

24:08.071 --> 24:09.030
- AND THEN SAY, "OH,
MY CLIENT MESSED IT ALL UP."

24:09.114 --> 24:10.740
- THE POSE LOOKED KIND OF WEIRD,
DUDE.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.868
- I KEPT TRYING TO CHANGE IT,
BUT I GOT TO GO WITH HIM,

24:12.951 --> 24:14.202
AND ORIGINALLY,
HE WANTED IT WIDER,

24:14.286 --> 24:15.370
AND IT'S NOT GOING
TO FIT ON THE CYLINDER,

24:15.453 --> 24:17.038
AND THE LEGS
WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT, WHATEVER.

24:17.122 --> 24:17.873
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND--
- SOUNDS LIKE AN EXCUSE THOUGH.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.624
- YOU CAN THROW WHAT YOU WANT.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.168
I'M GOING TO SIT THERE
AND TAKE WHAT I GOT TO TAKE,

24:21.251 --> 24:24.337
AND I STILL DON'T THINK I'M
GOING HOME, SO [bleep] YOU BOTH.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.812
- TODAY, YOU ALL
WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD

24:40.896 --> 24:44.274
TATTOOING THE SAME SUBJECT,
A PINUP.

24:44.357 --> 24:48.069
- I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THIS
IS NOT EVERYBODY'S BEST WORK.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.738
I HOPE THAT WE'RE SEEING
A LOT OF NERVOUSNESS.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.156
I HOPE THAT WE'RE SEEING
A LOT OF PEOPLE

24:51.239 --> 24:52.574
NOT SETTING THEIR STRIDE YET.

24:52.657 --> 24:55.911
IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU REALLY
DID YOUR BEST TATTOO TODAY,

24:55.994 --> 24:58.205
THEN GET READY TO GO HOME.

24:58.997 --> 25:03.210
- ROBBIE.

25:03.293 --> 25:04.669
- THIS THING'S LIKE AN ALIEN

25:04.753 --> 25:06.463
WITH THE HUGE EYE
AND THE LITTLE FEET.

25:06.546 --> 25:08.548
- I DEFINITELY LOST
MY CONFIDENCE.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.717
- I MEAN, THAT KNEECAP
LOOKS LIKE IT'S DISLOCATED.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.594
THEN THE ARM HAD
THE SAME CIRCULAR SHADING ON IT.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.888
IT MAKES IT KIND OF LOOK LIKE
IT'S IN PIECES.

25:14.971 --> 25:18.683
- THIS IS ONE OF THE ROUGHEST
ONES OF THE DAY BY FAR.

25:21.519 --> 25:23.563
- JAYVO.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.399
DID YOU TAKE THE PHOTOGRAPH?

25:26.483 --> 25:28.109
- YEAH.
- WERE YOU STANDING

25:28.193 --> 25:29.486
HIGHER THAN HER?
- YES.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.238
- BECAUSE IF YOU'RE HIGHER
THAN YOUR SUBJECT,

25:31.321 --> 25:32.489
YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE THEM LOOK SQUATTY.

25:32.572 --> 25:33.657
- YEAH, AND I NOTICED THAT
AFTER THE FACT.

25:33.740 --> 25:37.077
- THIS THING HAS HUGE HANDS
AND TINY FEET.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.245
IT'S JUST
NOT AN ATTRACTIVE TATTOO.

25:38.328 --> 25:40.288
YOU LOOK AT THOSE DETAILS.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.750
THE ARTISTRY, IT'S NOT THERE.

25:45.502 --> 25:48.171
- JULIA.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.591
- FOR THE ANATOMY
OF THIS PINUP,

25:51.675 --> 25:52.801
YOU PROBABLY HAVE ONE
OF THE BEST ONES IN THE ROOM.

25:52.884 --> 25:55.637
YOU DID A SMART THING--
YOU WENT MORE TRADITIONAL

25:55.720 --> 25:57.264
ALONG THE LINES OF PINUP FIGURE.

25:57.347 --> 25:58.682
GAVE HER A NICE POSTURE.
- YEAH.

25:58.765 --> 26:00.558
I MADE HER LITTLE BUTT
POPPING OUT.

26:00.642 --> 26:01.810
- AS FAR AS FITTING THE BODY,
I THINK YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

26:01.893 --> 26:04.854
OVERALL, IT'S AN AESTHETICALLY
PLEASING TATTOO,

26:04.938 --> 26:06.231
AND IT'S A SEXY TATTOO.

26:06.314 --> 26:07.649
- THANK YOU.

26:10.151 --> 26:11.569
- TY'ESHA.

26:14.572 --> 26:15.991
- LOOKING AT THE OUTLINE
ON THIS,

26:16.074 --> 26:17.575
IT DOES SHOW THAT YOU HAVE
A HARD TIME WITH AN OUTLINE.

26:17.659 --> 26:20.328
IF YOU LOOK
AT THE MEDICAL SYMBOLS,

26:20.412 --> 26:22.163
LOOK HOW SLOPPY THAT IS.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.164
LOOK AT THE WHITE
WITH THE RED AROUND IT.

26:23.248 --> 26:26.167
IT'S A MESS UP THERE.
- YES.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.502
- WHAT'S SHE SO EXCITED ABOUT?

26:27.585 --> 26:30.297
- BECAUSE SHE'S A BITCH.
- [laughs]

26:30.380 --> 26:31.506
- AH, DO YOU GUYS
HAVE A LITTLE TENSION

26:31.589 --> 26:33.258
GOING ON THERE?
- Y'ALL WANT TO SWITCH RIVALS?

26:33.341 --> 26:34.175
- SHE THINKS HER [bleep]'S
BETTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE'S.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.344
SHE GOT FLAWS TOO.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.222
- WHATEVER.

26:41.516 --> 26:45.145
- LT.

26:45.228 --> 26:46.479
- IT'S A BIG-ASS MOUTH SHE GOT.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.106
SHE DEFINITELY DOESN'T COME OFF
WITH THAT CUTE LOOK.

26:48.189 --> 26:50.692
YOU GOT TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN
YOU DO THESE SMALL LITTLE FACES,

26:50.775 --> 26:53.945
THE SMALLEST LITTLE MISTAKE
MAKES A BIG IMPACT.

26:54.029 --> 26:57.073
- MY BIGGEST MISTAKE IS
I WENT TOO SMALL WITH THE PIECE.

26:57.157 --> 26:58.992
- BUT THERE ARE GOOD TATTOOERS
OUT THERE

26:59.075 --> 27:02.954
THAT CAN BUST OUT A PINUP GIRL
THIS SIZE AND DO IT PERFECTLY.

27:03.038 --> 27:05.540
IF YOU CAN'T STACK UP
TO WHAT WE KNOW IS POSSIBLE,

27:05.623 --> 27:08.918
THEN IT DOESN'T LOOK
GOOD FOR YOU.

27:09.002 --> 27:12.589
- [sniffling]

27:12.672 --> 27:16.259
- ERIK.

27:16.343 --> 27:17.427
- TECHNICALLY SPEAKING,

27:17.510 --> 27:18.428
THIS IS ONE OF
MY FAVORITE TATTOOS OF THE DAY.

27:18.511 --> 27:21.056
YOU DID CAPTURE
SOME NICE DETAILS.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.266
YOU DO HAVE SOME NICE,
GOOD COLOR BLENDS.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.352
- YOU REALLY DID TATTOO ONE

27:25.435 --> 27:27.979
OF THE SEXIER FEMALE FORMS
OF THE DAY,

27:28.063 --> 27:30.982
AND IN TERMS OF ARTISTRY,
REALLY GREAT DESIGN.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.901
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

27:35.111 --> 27:36.696
- DON.

27:39.657 --> 27:42.619
{\an8}- THIS GIRL'S HAND THAT'S DOWN
IN THE GRASS, THAT LITTLE THUMB

27:42.702 --> 27:43.912
{\an8}AND THE OTHER TWO FINGERS

27:43.995 --> 27:45.955
THAT YOU SEE
WITH THAT LITTLE GREEN SPURT,

27:46.039 --> 27:48.666
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT
YOU DELIBERATELY PUT ON SOMEONE.

27:48.750 --> 27:49.751
- IN THE PHOTOGRAPH I WAS USING,
THAT'S ALL YOU COULD SEE.

27:49.834 --> 27:52.087
- IT'S A PHOTO
OF SOMETHING REAL,

27:52.170 --> 27:53.380
AND IT LOOKED BELIEVABLE.
- YEAH.

27:53.463 --> 27:57.592
- YOU LOST THE TRANSLATION
OF THAT PHOTO TO SKIN.

28:01.429 --> 28:03.139
- MARK.

28:03.223 --> 28:04.599
- OVERALL,
IT'S A REALLY CUTE TATTOO.

28:04.682 --> 28:07.143
I THINK
THAT YOU ACHIEVED SOMETHING

28:07.227 --> 28:09.270
THAT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT
FOR THIS CHALLENGE,

28:09.354 --> 28:12.148
WHICH WAS PRETTY EYES,
PRETTY NOSE, PRETTY MOUTH.

28:12.232 --> 28:15.193
- THE OVERALL COMPOSITION
TO THIS TATTOO IS JUST STIFF,

28:15.276 --> 28:17.070
AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
NERVOUS, AND IT'S SHOWING,

28:17.153 --> 28:21.533
BUT SHE STILL HAS A CUTER FACE
THAN MOST EVERYBODY'S.

28:24.494 --> 28:26.037
- RYAN.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.998
- THERE'S TECHNICAL HICCUPS
ALL OVER THIS TATTOO.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.708
LOOK AT THAT OUTLINE
ON THAT EYE.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.795
THAT'S WONKY, AND THAT'S WHAT WE
COMMONLY REFER TO AS BEAT.

28:33.878 --> 28:34.963
THE FOOT IS DRAWN HORRIBLY BAD--

28:35.046 --> 28:37.590
BOTH FEET.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR ARTISTRY.

28:37.674 --> 28:40.385
YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO DRAW.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE AN ARTIST.

28:44.097 --> 28:46.599
- AARON.

28:48.309 --> 28:50.520
- LET'S DROP INTO THIS THING
FOR THE TECHNICALS.

28:50.603 --> 28:53.314
THE DENT ON THE CHIN, INSTEAD
OF JUST COMING STRAIGHT DOWN,

28:53.398 --> 28:54.816
GAVE HER THE CHIPMUNK CHEEKS.

28:54.899 --> 28:56.734
THAT HAND IS A BROKEN HAND,

28:56.818 --> 28:58.736
OR ITS FINGERS ARE SO LONG THAT
IT IS LITERALLY CUPPING HERE

28:58.820 --> 29:01.197
AND WRAPPING ALL THE WAY
AROUND THE OTHER HAND

29:01.281 --> 29:03.658
TO HOLD THE WAND LIKE I'VE NEVER
SEEN ANY MAGICIAN HOLD A WAND.

29:03.741 --> 29:06.077
- IT'S JUST OUT OF WHACK, MAN.

29:06.161 --> 29:09.706
- [laughs]

29:09.789 --> 29:11.249
- EMILY.

29:15.086 --> 29:18.756
- IT'S AMAZING HOW STARVED
I WAS FOR A PRETTY FACE,

29:18.840 --> 29:20.216
AND THE FACE IS--IS HOT.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.676
- WELL, THANK YOU.
I DO APPRECIATE THAT.

29:21.759 --> 29:23.636
I THINK IT'S FAR BETTER
THAN ANYONE BEHIND ME.

29:23.720 --> 29:24.971
- IT LOOKS LIKE
A FRICKIN' BOBBLEHEAD.

29:25.054 --> 29:28.016
- I DON'T PARTICULARLY FIND
THE FACE SO AMAZING.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.684
YOU HAVE A LITTLE DENT
IN THE NOSE.

29:29.767 --> 29:31.102
- YEP.
- YOU HAVE CROOKED LIPS.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.228
- THOSE LIPS AREN'T CROOKED.

29:32.312 --> 29:33.521
- LOOK AT THEM.
- I AM LOOKING AT THEM.

29:33.605 --> 29:34.606
- LOOK WHERE THE BLACK IS
IN THE LIPS.

29:34.689 --> 29:36.149
- IT'S BASED OFF
OF AN ANIME DESIGN.

29:36.232 --> 29:38.526
IF THE CLIENT ASKS FOR IT,
I TRY TO APPEASE THEM.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.278
- IF A CLIENT HAS BAD TASTE

29:40.361 --> 29:42.489
AND YOU ARE NOT THE PERSON
THAT DIRECTS THE CLIENT

29:42.572 --> 29:45.033
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, YOU
WILL BE FINDING YOUR WAY OUT.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.625
- JASON.

29:53.708 --> 29:55.835
IS SHE WINKING
IN THIS PICTURE?

29:55.919 --> 29:57.712
- HER EYE'S ACTUALLY
WINKING RIGHT THERE.

29:57.795 --> 29:58.546
- YEAH, THAT WAS HARD TO TELL.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.466
- THAT WINK, BAD IDEA.

30:01.549 --> 30:04.219
HER EYEBROW IS PROTRUDING OUT
FURTHER THAN THE HAIR

30:04.302 --> 30:05.553
THAT COVERS HER FOREHEAD.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.181
- ONE LITTLE THING ON A PINUP
CHANGES LIFE.

30:08.264 --> 30:09.599
- YEAH.
- THAT'S YOUR ARTISTRY.

30:09.682 --> 30:10.850
- TRUST ME, I KNOW BETTER.

30:10.934 --> 30:13.102
- SO THEN KNOW BETTER.

30:16.397 --> 30:18.566
- JOSH.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.236
- TECHNICALLY, VERY SOLID.

30:21.319 --> 30:22.529
CLEAN LINES, SMOOTH SHADING,

30:22.612 --> 30:24.864
DEFINITELY THE DETAILS
THAT ARE IN THERE ARE NICE.

30:24.948 --> 30:26.407
THE LIPS, THE EYES, THE NOSE.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.576
- THE TECHNICAL SIDE
OF WHAT YOU SHOW,

30:28.660 --> 30:29.786
JUST IN THE FACE OF THIS THING,

30:29.869 --> 30:33.957
YOU COULD BE
A RUNAWAY TRAIN.

30:34.040 --> 30:37.252
- RUNAWAY TRAIN,
WATCH OUT FOR THIS GUY.

30:37.335 --> 30:40.421
- CHRIS.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.757
- YOU HAVE SOME AREAS
OF SOLID BLACK IN THE DRESS

30:42.840 --> 30:43.925
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HIGHLIGHT,
AND THEN IN THAT SLEEVE

30:44.008 --> 30:46.469
IS JUST WEIRD,
SCRATCHY LINE SHADING.

30:46.553 --> 30:47.845
- HONESTLY, I GOT TO THAT POINT,

30:47.929 --> 30:50.515
AND I WAS JUST LIKE,
I'M TIRED ALREADY,

30:50.598 --> 30:51.808
AND IT IS WHAT IT IS.

30:51.891 --> 30:53.101
- YOU CAN'T RUN OUT OF STEAM.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.727
IT'S NOT COOL TO DO THAT
TO YOUR CLIENT.

30:54.811 --> 30:57.730
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT,
DON'T BE HERE.

30:59.357 --> 31:02.110
{\an8}- ANGEL.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.615
- A LOT OF CANVASES WANTED
THEIR PINUPS ON THEIR RIBS,

31:07.699 --> 31:09.117
AND THE ARTISTS
TALK THEM OUT OF IT.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.452
WHY DID YOU STICK
WITH THIS PLACEMENT?

31:11.536 --> 31:12.787
- THERE WAS
NO CHANGING HIS MIND,

31:12.870 --> 31:14.372
AND MY OBJECTIVE
IS TO MAKE HIM HAPPY.

31:14.455 --> 31:16.499
- THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS
THAT STRIKES ME

31:16.583 --> 31:18.251
AS SEXY ON ANY LEVEL.

31:18.334 --> 31:19.794
IN THE FACE,
SHE LOOKS BUMMED OUT.

31:19.877 --> 31:21.045
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.589
I THINK JUST THE POSE
WITH THE TIRED LOOK

31:22.672 --> 31:23.756
MAKES IT LOOK GORILLA-ESQUE.

31:23.840 --> 31:27.594
- IT'S AN UNAPPEALING TATTOO.

31:30.638 --> 31:32.974
- CLEEN.

31:33.057 --> 31:34.058
- FROM THE WAIST UP,

31:34.142 --> 31:36.019
I LIKE
THE EXAGGERATED BODY SIZE.

31:36.102 --> 31:38.229
HER SHOULDERS LOOK LIKE
THEY'RE ON THE RIGHT PLANE.

31:38.313 --> 31:39.564
SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE'S CONNECTED.

31:39.647 --> 31:41.441
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY DISCOMBOBULATED LIMBS.

31:41.524 --> 31:43.401
- I LOVE THE CHALKBOARD
WITH THE EQUATION.

31:43.484 --> 31:44.861
I LOVE THE PAPERS
WITH THE GRADES.

31:44.944 --> 31:45.862
IT TELLS A STORY.

31:45.945 --> 31:47.280
AS FAR AS ARTISTRY GOES,

31:47.363 --> 31:49.699
I THINK THIS IS ONE
OF THE BEST TATTOOS OF THE DAY.

31:49.782 --> 31:52.410
- THANK YOU.

31:52.493 --> 31:55.038
- TIM.

31:55.121 --> 31:57.498
- THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS
WITH THIS TATTOO.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.626
THE ONE HAND
THAT'S UP ON THE FRET BOARD,

31:59.709 --> 32:00.418
THAT [bleep] IS CRAZY.
- YEAH.

32:00.501 --> 32:02.337
IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A PAW.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.130
- THE FLOWERS AROUND THE ANKLES,

32:04.213 --> 32:05.465
THAT'S A TINY LITTLE
TIGHT DETAIL.

32:05.548 --> 32:08.968
IF YOU CAN DO THAT, YOU SHOULD
BE ABLE TO DO A MOUTH.

32:09.052 --> 32:11.137
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO A NOSE.
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO AN EYE.

32:11.220 --> 32:14.390
THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS ABOUT
THIS TATTOO IS THE ARTISTRY.

32:14.474 --> 32:16.768
IT'S NOT THE TECHNICAL ABILITY.

32:18.686 --> 32:20.146
- BEFORE WE SEND YOU BACK
TO THE LOFT,

32:20.229 --> 32:22.148
JUDGES, LET'S DECIDE
WHO WON THIS CHALLENGE.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.570
- I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO DEFINITELY SAY JOSH.

32:27.654 --> 32:28.905
HE'S THE MOST SOLIDLY,

32:28.988 --> 32:31.366
TECHNICALLY PROFICIENT TATTOO
WE'VE SEEN TODAY.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.034
- JOSH'S FIRE WOMAN,

32:33.117 --> 32:34.911
IT WAS GOOD, CLEAN WORK.
IT HAD A PRETTY FACE.

32:34.994 --> 32:37.038
- I WISH THAT EVERYBODY
TATTOOED THAT CLEAN.

32:37.121 --> 32:38.498
- SOUNDS LIKE
WE HAVE A DECISION.

32:38.581 --> 32:42.377
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED
THAT THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY

32:42.460 --> 32:44.629
GOES TO JOSH.

32:44.712 --> 32:46.798
CONGRATULATIONS, JOSH.
- THANK YOU.

32:46.881 --> 32:48.132
- FOR THE REST OF YOU,

32:48.216 --> 32:51.135
ONE OF YOU WILL BE
PACKING YOUR MACHINES TODAY.

32:51.219 --> 32:54.430
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW.

32:54.514 --> 32:57.350
THEIR VOTE WILL PUT ONE ARTIST
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

32:57.433 --> 32:58.643
HEAD ON BACK TO THE LOFT,

32:58.726 --> 33:02.230
AND WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

33:07.944 --> 33:10.488
- YOUR DESIGN WAS FLAWED.

33:10.571 --> 33:11.739
I'M NOT SAYING I'M BETTER.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.199
I'M JUST SAYING,
I MADE A SMART CHOICE.

33:13.282 --> 33:14.617
YOU DIDN'T.

33:14.701 --> 33:15.910
- YOU ARE A [bleep] TATTOOER.
- GET OUT OF HERE.

33:15.993 --> 33:19.038
- I [bleep] UP,
AND YOU DID MEDIOCRE,

33:19.122 --> 33:20.581
MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD
LIKE YOU'RE USED TO.

33:20.665 --> 33:21.791
- BYE.

33:21.874 --> 33:22.917
I'M JUST TIRED OF ROBBIE
CONSTANTLY TELLING ME

33:23.000 --> 33:24.544
I'M A [bleep] ARTIST.

33:24.627 --> 33:26.754
{\an8}EVEN THOUGH I KNOW IT'S NOT
TRUE, IT'S STILL [bleep] HURTS.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.756
{\an8}DUDE, MY BROTHER'S 18 YEARS IN.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.258
THAT DOESN'T MAKE HIM BETTER.

33:30.341 --> 33:31.426
IT JUST MEANS
HE'S BEEN DOING IT LONGER.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.428
- WE GONNA END THIS,
OR ARE WE GONNA KEEP--

33:33.511 --> 33:34.887
- WHAT ARE YOU
BICKERING ABOUT NOW?

33:34.971 --> 33:37.932
- THE WHOLE THING BOILS DOWN TO,
I STARTED 13 YEARS AGO.

33:38.015 --> 33:39.434
I PICKED UP A MACHINE
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

33:39.517 --> 33:43.271
AND I ONLY WORKED ONE DAY A WEEK
FOR 11 YEARS, OKAY,

33:43.354 --> 33:45.523
BECAUSE MY FAMILY
HAD OTHER BUSINESSES,

33:45.606 --> 33:46.691
AND MY PARENTS NEEDED ME,

33:46.774 --> 33:48.609
AND I ALWAYS STOOD
BY MY FAMILY.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.445
HE FAULTS ME FOR THAT AND SAYS,

33:50.528 --> 33:52.613
I NEVER CARED ABOUT TATTOOING.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.115
I'M A FAKER.
I'M A POSER.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.743
- ALWAYS, ALWAYS
WITH THE "POOR MES."

33:56.826 --> 33:58.035
THAT MOTHER[bleep]
DOES MEDIOCRE WORK.

33:58.119 --> 34:00.788
- DUDE, STOP POINTING THE FINGER
AT ME

34:00.872 --> 34:01.956
AND TELLING ME HOW [bleep] I AM.

34:02.039 --> 34:03.958
- I THINK
JAYVO JUST WANTS RESPECT.

34:04.041 --> 34:04.959
- YOU'RE NOT GIVING HIM
A CHANCE, PERIOD.

34:05.042 --> 34:07.128
- DUDE--
- ARE YOU [bleep] KIDDING ME?

34:07.211 --> 34:08.295
- HE CALLED ME OUT, "OH, YOU
BEEN FAKING BEING A TATTOOER."

34:08.379 --> 34:11.507
- YOU ARE A WORDSMITH,
SNEAKY, BITCH-ASS LIAR.

34:11.591 --> 34:14.635
YOU MOTHER[bleep]!

34:14.719 --> 34:16.137
- EASY.
- WOW.

34:20.056 --> 34:21.934
- HE PLAYS THE VICTIM,
LIKE I'M THIS BULLY.

34:22.018 --> 34:22.518
DUDE, HE GETS IN MY HEAD.

34:22.601 --> 34:24.061
HE DOES THIS.

34:24.145 --> 34:26.313
AND THEN NOW
BECAUSE I'VE GOT

34:26.397 --> 34:28.775
ALL OF THIS [bleep] RESENTMENT
BUILT UP,

34:28.858 --> 34:30.275
I [bleep] CAN'T EVEN BE
[bleep] COOL WITH MY BROTHER.

34:30.359 --> 34:33.946
BECAUSE EVERY [bleep] TIME
I TRY TO TALK ABOUT IT,

34:34.030 --> 34:35.864
THAT PIECE OF [bleep]
[bleep] ACTS LIKE

34:35.947 --> 34:37.324
I'M THE [bleep] BAD GUY

34:37.408 --> 34:39.327
WHEN I JUST WANT
TO [bleep] FIX IT.

34:39.409 --> 34:43.206
I JUST WANT TO HUG, KISS,
[bleep] MAKE UP, GET OVER IT,

34:43.289 --> 34:46.333
AND NEVER GO
THROUGH THIS BULL[bleep] AGAIN.

34:54.717 --> 34:57.512
- ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE TESTING
ARTISTRY WITH PINUPS.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.889
ROUGH OUTING TODAY, HUH?
- TO SAY THE LEAST.

34:59.972 --> 35:01.349
- WELL, LET'S START OFF
WITH ANGEL.

35:01.432 --> 35:04.018
- IT LOOKS LIKE
A SILVERBACK GORILLA WITH A WIG.

35:04.101 --> 35:06.437
- THIS IS TRULY ONE
OF THE ONLY FRENCH MAID PINUPS

35:06.521 --> 35:10.441
WHERE ALL I WOULD LIKE
HER TO DO IS CLEAN THE HOUSE.

35:11.108 --> 35:13.277
NEXT UP WE HAD ROBBIE.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.404
- LOOKING AT PEOPLE'S ARTISTRY,
THERE'S SO MANY ELEMENTS

35:15.488 --> 35:18.199
TO THIS TATTOO
THAT ARE JUST UNBELIEVABLE.

35:18.282 --> 35:21.035

TO THE TOP OF THE BOOT
AND THE OTHER KNEE

35:22.662 --> 35:24.497

IT'S NOT THE SAME.

IF YOU DON'T NOTICE THAT
WHEN YOU'RE DRAWING IT,

35:26.207 --> 35:28.751
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
- LT.

35:28.835 --> 35:30.419
- THERE ARE
SO MANY SHORTCOMINGS.

35:30.503 --> 35:33.881
HIS LINE WORK, THE EYES,
THE EYEBROWS, THE LIPS.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.216

I CAN'T GET PAST IT.

35:38.052 --> 35:39.512
IT'S JUST NOT APPEALING.

35:39.595 --> 35:42.557

IT'S NONEXISTENT.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.100
LOOK AT THE BACKGROUND.

35:44.183 --> 35:47.228
THERE'S NO RHYME OR REASON
FOR THIS WEIRD BLUE NONSENSE.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.063
- WE HAVE A TOUGH DECISION
TO MAKE HERE,

35:49.146 --> 35:51.858
AND I'M REALLY CURIOUS AS TO HOW
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY VOTED...

35:51.941 --> 35:52.859
- YEAH.

35:52.942 --> 35:54.819
- BECAUSE THEY COULD TIP
THE SCALES HERE.

35:54.902 --> 35:59.156
{\an8}- WE'RE HERE TO DETERMINE WHO
HAD THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.533
- THIS IS MY TATTOO.

36:00.616 --> 36:02.243
MY ARTIST WAS LT.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.078
THERE'S REALLY NOT A WHOLE LOT
I LIKE ABOUT IT.

36:04.161 --> 36:06.247
- THE FACE
IS NOT APPEALING AT ALL.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.749
- IT LOOKS LIKE RONALD MCDONALD
DRESSED IN DRAG.

36:08.833 --> 36:12.044
- HER FOOT IS TURNING OUTWARD,
AND HER BOOBS ARE DOWN HERE.

36:12.128 --> 36:15.590
I DON'T THINK ANY OF IT IS
REALLY PROPORTIONED CORRECTLY.

36:15.673 --> 36:16.299
- IT'S JUST UGLY, MAN.

36:16.382 --> 36:18.759
IT'S FLAT-OUT UGLY.

36:18.843 --> 36:21.929
- THIS IS MY TATTOO,
AND MY ARTIST WAS DON.

36:22.013 --> 36:25.224
THE ONLY THING THAT I LIKE ABOUT
THIS TATTOO IS THE BABY PIG.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.601
THAT CLUB FOOT AND HER FACE,

36:26.684 --> 36:28.769
THEY'RE THE TWO THINGS
THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.146
- YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GIVE
HER BOOTS.

36:30.229 --> 36:31.731
- OH, THERE WILL BE BOOTS ADDED.

36:31.814 --> 36:34.942
I THINK MY TATTOO ABSOLUTELY
DESERVES TO BE IN THE BOTTOM.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.904
YOU CANNOT BE INK MASTER

36:37.987 --> 36:39.780

36:39.864 --> 36:40.990
- THIS IS MY TATTOO.

36:41.073 --> 36:42.450
MY ARTIST WAS TIM.

36:42.533 --> 36:45.202
- IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S MORPHING
INTO A FEMALE LION.

36:45.286 --> 36:47.580
HER HANDS LOOK LIKE LION PAWS.

36:47.663 --> 36:49.040
- I JUST CAN'T GET
OVER HER FACE.

36:49.123 --> 36:51.959
I THINK IT'S THE HAIR
AND THE MUSTACHE.
