WEBVTT

00:10.427 --> 00:13.555
My family and I
have spread the word of the Lord

00:13.555 --> 00:15.224
all over this country,

00:15.224 --> 00:18.685
and we have seen great joy
and great suffering.

00:19.770 --> 00:24.942
Many people will tell you that
we no longer live in an age of miracles.

00:25.776 --> 00:30.155
"Preacher man, I lost my job.
Preacher man, I go hungry.

00:30.155 --> 00:33.450
My children go hungry.
I don't see any miracles here."

00:33.951 --> 00:38.705
But my children, John and Elizabeth,
they're miracles.

00:38.705 --> 00:43.252
Us being here together is a miracle.
You are a miracle.

00:43.252 --> 00:46.338
That sign that you have been waiting for,
it already happened.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.882
First you must believe,
then come the miracles.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.259
Not the other way around.

00:50.259 --> 00:53.428
- So do you believe?
- Yes.

00:53.428 --> 00:54.847
I said, do you believe?

00:54.847 --> 00:56.682
- Yes.
- Yes, Lord. We believe.

00:57.558 --> 01:00.936
Now, I ask you, Lord,
if I can serve as your vessel,

01:00.936 --> 01:02.396
give us a sign.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.819
God is good.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.449
<i>John, when I grow up,</i>

01:14.449 --> 01:17.870
will I be able to talk to God
and help people like Daddy does?

01:17.870 --> 01:19.955
Lizzie, you don't wanna be like Daddy.

01:19.955 --> 01:21.039
What do you mean?

01:21.957 --> 01:25.210
Daddy doesn't speak to God.
It's all for show.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.130
He's just a real good liar.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.883
I don't believe you. What about the fire?

01:44.563 --> 01:45.564
You watching?

01:53.030 --> 01:54.239
It's pistachios.

01:54.740 --> 01:58.243
Whenever Dad needs a sign from God,
I just use these.

01:58.827 --> 02:01.788
Chemistry. That's the real magic.

02:02.706 --> 02:06.126
Will Daddy go to hell for lying?

02:07.127 --> 02:10.422
Well, I guess that depends
on whether you think hell is real.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.341
What do you think?

02:14.510 --> 02:15.761
I think that...

02:18.555 --> 02:20.891
living a lie will eat you up inside.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.229
And whatever hell is...

02:27.814 --> 02:29.191
must feel something like that.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.865
Hallelujah. Praise God.

04:02.534 --> 04:05.370
You know,
I knew it from the moment I saw her.

04:05.370 --> 04:08.957
I said to Walter,
"That is a star right there."

04:13.629 --> 04:16.380
I'm seeing that we have
two more minutes before we wrap up.

04:16.964 --> 04:19.593
How about a quick Q and A
with the audience?

04:24.389 --> 04:27.476
Are those pants? Why is she wearing pants?

04:27.476 --> 04:28.810
Cameras, follow her.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.312
How about you?

04:31.396 --> 04:32.564
Hello, Miss Zott.

04:32.564 --> 04:33.690
Hello, Miss...

04:33.690 --> 04:36.151
Fillis. Mrs. Carol Fillis.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.947
I could be way off base here.
My husband likes to say

04:39.947 --> 04:42.074
what I lack in smarts
I make up for in effort.

04:42.658 --> 04:43.617
But when you said

04:43.617 --> 04:46.411
osmosis was the movement
of a less concentrated solvent

04:46.411 --> 04:49.331
through a semipermeable membrane
to another more concentrated solvent,

04:49.331 --> 04:51.250
I found myself wondering

04:51.250 --> 04:56.672
if my leg edema might be a by-product
of faulty hydraulic conductivity

04:56.672 --> 04:58.048
in my own plasmas.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.716
What kind of medicine do you practice?

04:59.716 --> 05:02.553
Oh, no, I'm not a doctor.
I'm just a housewife.

05:02.553 --> 05:05.556
"Just" is a lousy word
second only to "actually."

05:06.139 --> 05:08.058
Do you want to be a doctor?

05:08.058 --> 05:10.310
Oh, heavens, no.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.605
I've got my boys and Peter
to take care of.

05:13.605 --> 05:16.191
Then let me reask the question.
If you were to be a doctor, what kind?

05:16.191 --> 05:17.359
An open-heart surgeon.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.115
I'm only kidding, of course. I--

05:24.408 --> 05:26.118
How could someone like me even begin--

05:26.118 --> 05:30.497
The public library.
And then MCATs, school and residency.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.544
You really think I could do it?

05:36.545 --> 05:41.300
Dr. Fillis, open-heart surgeon.
Sounds entirely plausible to me.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.808
It appears I am not alone.

05:52.561 --> 05:53.562
Thank you.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.275
<i>All across the South,</i>

05:58.275 --> 06:01.403
<i>we've been seeing young folk
participating in what they call "sit-ins."</i>

06:01.403 --> 06:03.280
<i>I'm here at the Montgomery courthouse,</i>

06:03.280 --> 06:06.283
<i>where one of the lead agitators
and proponents of this method,</i>

06:06.283 --> 06:11.121
<i>the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.,
was arrested on charges of loitering.</i>

06:13.290 --> 06:15.209
Him wasn't doing a goddamn thing

06:15.209 --> 06:18.128
but standing on the corner
in broad daylight.

06:18.128 --> 06:21.256
His mere presence is powerful,
and they know it.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.509
The only thing more dangerous
than being Black in public

06:23.509 --> 06:25.302
is when you start inspiring people.

06:25.928 --> 06:30.307
- Linda, Junior, upstairs, please.
- No.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.685
They need to see this too.

06:34.186 --> 06:37.189
Yeah, Dad. Claudette Colvin is my age.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.322
All right.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.325
- How was school?
- Good.

06:50.369 --> 06:52.162
That's it? That's all I get?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.710
How about you tell me
one new thing you learned today?

07:00.003 --> 07:03.799
Did you know that the line
between the numerator and the denominator

07:03.799 --> 07:05.217
is called the vinculum?

07:06.260 --> 07:07.678
I did not know that.

07:07.678 --> 07:10.722
I wonder what the etymology is.
I'll get the dictionary.

07:10.722 --> 07:14.268
I'm a little tired.
Could you let me know in the morning?

07:15.310 --> 07:16.311
Of course.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.232
I love you, bunny.

07:20.816 --> 07:21.733
I love you too.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.224
Hi, Dad.

08:16.538 --> 08:20.918
I loved watching you
up there. You're so inspiring.

08:20.918 --> 08:21.835
Bless you.

08:22.794 --> 08:23.795
Thank you.

08:33.764 --> 08:36.350
I clocked seven whole minutes
of seeing your face tonight.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.477
Well, you got about one minute more.

08:39.602 --> 08:40.812
Where are my charts?

08:50.447 --> 08:52.407
I can't stop thinking about the news.

08:53.492 --> 08:56.662
The way they pushed that brilliant,
decent man down the street

08:56.662 --> 09:00.040
like he was a criminal. I need to--

09:01.834 --> 09:04.795
I need to channel all this
inside me somewhere good.

09:04.795 --> 09:06.505
All you do is good, hon.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.634
We're gonna stop traffic.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.304
College students in the South
have been kneeling at churches,

09:14.304 --> 09:17.057
sitting in at lunch counters.
Why can't we do the same on the freeway?

09:17.057 --> 09:19.184
Harriet, you can't be serious.

09:19.184 --> 09:21.603
It's a form of peaceful protest.

09:21.603 --> 09:25.107
We both know there is no such thing
when people like us carry signs.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.695
I know that you want to save the world,
but we're barely seeing each other

09:29.695 --> 09:30.779
as it is.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.656
Now he's concerned.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.993
That's what I said would happen
if you took that Kaiser job.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.536
We've got our careers, yes,

09:37.536 --> 09:39.705
also our kids to worry about.

09:39.705 --> 09:41.748
I see. I see. I see. So...

09:42.249 --> 09:45.252
you're scared
of what your white colleagues will think

09:45.252 --> 09:47.296
about your radical disobedient wife.

09:47.296 --> 09:49.089
Do not put those words in my mouth.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.925
I'm sorry, husband dear.
Did I talk out of turn?

09:55.179 --> 09:56.180
That's not fair.

10:05.397 --> 10:06.940
This conversation isn't over.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.984
I agree. I'll see you in the morning.

10:09.902 --> 10:10.944
I love you.

10:15.324 --> 10:17.784
- Sloane residence.
- Did you watch the show today?

10:19.453 --> 10:20.454
Sorry, no.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.126
I didn't catch it.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.213
I wore pants on national TV.

10:29.213 --> 10:32.633
I could actually feel Phil's arteries
constricting in real time.

10:35.469 --> 10:36.512
Wow.

10:36.512 --> 10:38.680
<i>My team and I
have been planning it for weeks.</i>

10:38.680 --> 10:40.474
<i>I can't believe we pulled it off.</i>

10:40.974 --> 10:44.019
<i>I finally feel like
I'm making a difference at the studio.</i>

10:44.019 --> 10:46.271
<i>I've never been more tired...</i>

10:52.152 --> 10:55.197
Hold it right there, you two. Hold on.

10:58.659 --> 10:59.576
Congratulations.

10:59.576 --> 11:04.498
Supper at Six is now brought to you
exclusively by Swift & Crisp.

11:05.082 --> 11:09.253
Elizabeth Zott's and America's
favorite choice in shortening.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.922
Where are my fucking coupes?

11:11.922 --> 11:14.174
Shari! Where are my fucking coupes?

11:14.174 --> 11:17.678
No, Swift & Crisp is not
my favorite choice in shortening.

11:17.678 --> 11:20.305
Have you ever inspected
the lipid dispersion

11:20.305 --> 11:22.015
at a microscopic level?

11:22.015 --> 11:24.142
The reason why
the dough rises high and fast

11:24.142 --> 11:26.603
is because it is hydrogenated synthetic
vegetable oil.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.146
To say nothing of the taste.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.482
Yeah. Inspecting the lipids
is on my to-do list

11:30.482 --> 11:32.276
right after not giving a single shit.

11:32.276 --> 11:33.360
Walter.

11:33.986 --> 11:35.237
Here we are.

11:35.737 --> 11:38.115
No. I will not lie to my audience.

11:38.115 --> 11:41.785
They tune in because I'm honest,
because I treat them with respect.

11:43.287 --> 11:44.121
Liz.

11:45.330 --> 11:48.333
Do you know why people watch television?

11:49.418 --> 11:51.170
Because it's on.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.548
If you have a problem with this, well,
then we'll just find another lady chemist

11:54.548 --> 11:59.553
to cook us a pot roast tomorrow,
and we'll call it Feasting at Five.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.806
- Okay, okay, everyone take a breath--
- Shut the fuck up, Walter.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.520
You do Swift & Crisp, or you're out.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.857
Have a great show, everybody.

12:16.028 --> 12:17.070
All right, ladies.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.281
We've got to start spreading the word
about this protest.

12:19.281 --> 12:22.034
Marge, I need you to reach out
to our guy at the LA Times.

12:22.034 --> 12:24.369
If they pick it up,
Washington Post follows suit.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.538
Shirley, put that keen eye to use
on some flyers for me

12:26.538 --> 12:28.290
and mimeograph at least 300 copies.

12:28.290 --> 12:32.002
Start with the college campuses and then
get them all out into the local stores,

12:32.002 --> 12:34.296
offices, diners. What am I forgetting?

12:34.296 --> 12:35.714
- Gas stations.
- Yep.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.759
And I need to reach out to Ella Baker.
She's been working closely with students,

12:38.759 --> 12:41.386
and I want to involve the groups
who have already been doing the work.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.388
All right. Thank you, ladies.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.478
Welcome to Supper at Six.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.399
<i>Today is an exciting day here on the show,</i>

12:54.399 --> 12:57.653
because I will be introducing you
to one of my favorite ingredients.

13:08.872 --> 13:12.334
There has been a recent craze
surrounding vegetable shortening,

13:12.334 --> 13:15.045
also known as hydrogenated cottonseed oil.

13:16.588 --> 13:21.468
However, I will be making
strawberry shortcake with...

13:23.554 --> 13:25.597
beef tallow as our source of fat.

13:27.266 --> 13:29.852
<i>High-quality beef tallow
is extremely nutritious.</i>

13:29.852 --> 13:32.646
- However, if money is an issue...
- I'll talk to her at the first commercial.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.531
<i>Beef tallow is not only highly nutritious,</i>

13:42.531 --> 13:44.783
<i>but it also has
an uncommonly high smoke point</i>

13:44.783 --> 13:46.743
<i>at 400 degrees Fahrenheit...</i>

13:56.545 --> 13:59.006
- St. Luke's Boys' Home.
- Hello.

13:59.006 --> 14:05.888
I'm calling to find out if my father,
Calvin Evans, lived there around 1931.

14:06.555 --> 14:07.681
<i>Can you hold, please?</i>

14:07.681 --> 14:09.349
Yes, I'll wait.

14:10.184 --> 14:12.352
I called all the St. Luke's

14:12.352 --> 14:15.105
from Delaware to Wyoming.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.941
Fifty-six St. Luke's Boys' Homes.

14:17.941 --> 14:21.737
Forty said my dad never went there.
Seven didn't pick up.

14:21.737 --> 14:25.282
And nine wouldn't tell me,
because it's policy.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.620
It seems this case has gone cold.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.538
What does that mean?

14:32.289 --> 14:34.291
A cold case means you hit a dead end.

14:35.334 --> 14:36.460
So it's an idiom.

14:36.960 --> 14:37.836
That's right.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.339
I hate idioms.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.015
Can I tell you a secret?

14:52.518 --> 14:53.519
I--

14:54.478 --> 14:58.232
I have only read the Bible twice
back to front.

14:58.232 --> 14:59.816
Why is that secret?

14:59.816 --> 15:00.943
It's because I'm a minister.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.820
And because I have read
The Murder of Roger Ackroyd

15:03.820 --> 15:05.572
at least 20 times.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.825
It's my favorite book
by my favorite author, Agatha Christie.

15:09.326 --> 15:12.329
Her detective, Hercule Poirot,
doesn't believe in dead ends.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.749
According to him,
the truth is already within us,

15:15.749 --> 15:19.211
somewhere inside of our brains.
We just have to unlock it.

15:19.211 --> 15:22.965
How can something be inside of my brain
if I haven't learned it yet?

15:23.632 --> 15:27.511
You start with what you already know.
I bet you'll surprise yourself.

15:36.854 --> 15:37.980
Hello, Liz.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.773
Care for a piece of cake, Phil?

15:39.773 --> 15:40.899
Thank you. I will.

15:42.025 --> 15:45.028
Great show today.
You're suspended for three days.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.990
May I have your attention, everyone?

15:48.907 --> 15:52.327
We will be airing reruns
over the course of the next three days.

15:52.327 --> 15:56.206
All nonessential personnel
will be suspended without pay.

15:56.206 --> 16:00.252
Any questions? Ask your star.

16:12.222 --> 16:15.267
<i>We've never had a celebrity
in our home before.</i>

16:15.851 --> 16:17.769
Your father has a gift.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.605
Well, it's not a gift.

16:20.189 --> 16:22.691
I'm just a vessel for the good Lord.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.235
Would you say grace, Reverend?

16:25.235 --> 16:26.320
Of course.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.463
You could've put
my whole livelihood at risk.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.132
You disgust me. You make me sick.

16:47.633 --> 16:50.719
And I swear to God, if I catch you
with another boy, I'll kill you myself!

16:50.719 --> 16:53.555
It's enough! I've had enough!

16:55.057 --> 16:58.143
I'll deal with you later.
Now get up. We got a show to do.

17:05.526 --> 17:07.528
<i>I feel the darkness growing.</i>

17:07.528 --> 17:10.280
An evil possession among us!

17:12.824 --> 17:13.825
Come to me.

17:15.827 --> 17:19.455
Holy Spirit! Holy Spirit, consume me!

17:19.455 --> 17:21.290
Save this child's soul!

17:23.836 --> 17:24.962
Praise Jesus!

17:24.962 --> 17:29.758
Hallelujah! God is good. God is merciful.

17:48.443 --> 17:50.404
- Pardon me.
- Sorry.

17:50.404 --> 17:55.200
Oh, Elizabeth. Oh, my goodness.
I can't believe it's you.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.286
I think I'm a little starstruck.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.664
How are things? Are you still at Hastings?

18:01.248 --> 18:03.584
No. I left shortly after you did.

18:03.584 --> 18:06.795
I've been looking around for work,
but I haven't found the right thing yet.

18:08.005 --> 18:10.465
I hate how we ended things.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.427
I've thought about calling you,
but I figure, you know,

18:13.427 --> 18:14.928
you probably despise me.

18:16.263 --> 18:19.057
Hastings wasn't an easy place
for any of us to be.

18:19.683 --> 18:22.895
No, but that's not much of an excuse,
is it?

18:23.645 --> 18:27.608
Anyway, it makes me genuinely very happy
to see you become so successful, and--

18:27.608 --> 18:29.860
You know, after everything
that you went through.

18:31.486 --> 18:32.988
Well, don't get used to it, but thank you.

18:34.406 --> 18:36.200
Anyway, my daughter will be coming
home from school soon.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.534
Of course. Go, go, go.

18:40.245 --> 18:43.916
If you'd like to come to a taping,
I can leave a ticket with my office?

18:44.917 --> 18:48.378
I would be delighted. Yeah. Thank you.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.130
Okay.

18:52.341 --> 18:53.383
Bye.

19:06.522 --> 19:08.065
Looking for more boys' homes?

19:08.065 --> 19:10.275
No, that was a dead end.

19:11.109 --> 19:13.529
Could you please help us
look up any documents

19:13.529 --> 19:15.697
that include the name Calvin Evans?

19:15.697 --> 19:18.617
Private individuals
are the hardest to cross-reference.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.495
He was a famous scientist, if that helps.

19:22.496 --> 19:25.457
Write his name here
and check back in a few days.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.543
I'll see what I can find.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.338
Welcome back.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.215
I can't believe she wouldn't just do it.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.050
If they would pay me as much as her,

19:35.050 --> 19:36.969
I'd say whatever they wanted me to say.

19:39.805 --> 19:40.806
Excuse me.

19:47.855 --> 19:50.065
So, how was Johnny's play?

19:50.691 --> 19:51.942
I'm not sure.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.570
I had to leave him with my sister

19:54.570 --> 19:56.780
while I was picking up shifts
sweeping hair

19:56.780 --> 19:58.240
to make up for this week's losses.

20:00.075 --> 20:03.620
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know Phil was going to do that.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.707
Those decisions are above my pay grade.

20:11.295 --> 20:14.047
But maybe next time
you want to stick it to the man,

20:14.715 --> 20:17.426
you give the people who actually
need the money a second thought.

20:18.969 --> 20:19.970
Excuse me.

20:29.396 --> 20:32.524
Tonight's show will begin a little
differently than what you're used to.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.276
Go B camera.

20:35.652 --> 20:38.488
I am announcing a new relationship

20:38.989 --> 20:43.118
with our partners at Swift & Crisp.

20:43.118 --> 20:47.998
America's number one choice
in shortening, and mine.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.252
To kick things off,
I will be making Oysters Zott.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.254
My spin on Oysters Rockefeller

20:54.254 --> 20:58.425
prepared with my one and only
better baking secret weapon,

20:59.092 --> 21:00.302
Swift & Crisp.

21:10.229 --> 21:13.273
And that is Oysters Zott.

21:17.402 --> 21:19.363
It looks like we have time
for some questions.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.786
I'm trying to lose weight.

21:25.786 --> 21:28.914
Is Swift & Crisp also your secret
to staying so thin?

21:29.498 --> 21:33.585
No. My weight is due to
genetics, likely, and stress.

21:33.585 --> 21:36.213
Do you moisturize before bed
or first thing in the morning?

21:36.213 --> 21:38.841
There are no substitute for natural oils.

21:38.841 --> 21:40.384
Are there any other questions?

21:42.469 --> 21:43.345
So many.

21:44.263 --> 21:45.472
That was sensational.

21:45.472 --> 21:48.141
Radically different experience
being in the room.

21:48.141 --> 21:49.726
The smells, the sounds.

21:50.227 --> 21:53.021
It was extortion, pure and simple,
but thank you.

21:53.021 --> 21:54.898
And the Q and A, genius.

21:54.898 --> 21:58.151
I do have a couple thoughts.
Minor, nothing notes. If you're amenable.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.236
Please.

21:59.736 --> 22:02.656
You don't have to answer every question.
That's all.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.200
But that defeats the purpose of a Q and A.

22:05.701 --> 22:07.411
A Q and A on your show.

22:07.411 --> 22:09.746
You should have someone
screen the questions ahead of time

22:09.746 --> 22:11.957
so you aren't asked
about your moisturizing routine.

22:11.957 --> 22:14.126
They can get those tips
from Woman's Daily.

22:14.126 --> 22:16.628
And frankly, I would never go to you
for beauty tips.

22:16.628 --> 22:18.380
But what do I know?

22:18.380 --> 22:21.300
Thank you again for the ticket.
It was a treat.

22:24.761 --> 22:27.973
Fran. You said you're looking for work?

22:29.016 --> 22:30.100
Do you have a minute?

22:30.893 --> 22:35.522
Walter, I'd like you to meet
my new chief of staff Fran Frask.

22:37.149 --> 22:40.194
- Hi.
- Hi. It's a bit drab in here.

22:40.194 --> 22:42.779
Oh, yeah. Well, it's an office.

22:42.779 --> 22:45.449
Most people spend more time
with their coworkers than at home,

22:45.449 --> 22:48.535
so wouldn't you want it to be more warm,
welcoming, fragrant?

22:49.703 --> 22:50.996
Are you two related?

22:53.790 --> 22:54.625
Joan, can you--

22:54.625 --> 22:55.751
- Joan can help you.
- Yeah.

22:55.751 --> 22:56.877
- Hi.
- Why don't you--

22:56.877 --> 22:58.712
- Nice to meet you.
- See if she can--

23:01.882 --> 23:02.883
Walter?

23:05.677 --> 23:08.222
Is something wrong?
You seem particularly sweaty.

23:08.222 --> 23:13.227
No, nothing. I-- How are you?

23:13.727 --> 23:18.357
I know what you just did was--
It was difficult.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.275
It was excruciating.

23:20.776 --> 23:22.945
Well, that's how you know
you're succeeding in showbiz.

23:27.741 --> 23:29.826
You did the right thing, Elizabeth.

23:32.371 --> 23:34.790
The lesser of two evils is still evil.

23:47.094 --> 23:50.055
There were several news filings on record
under the name Calvin Evans

23:50.055 --> 23:52.516
and one public record
of a cease and desist.

23:53.016 --> 23:55.811
But that was it.
Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.

23:56.854 --> 24:00.023
Wait. This is it.

24:01.108 --> 24:02.860
I need to tell Linda and Junior.

24:03.777 --> 24:05.362
Wake up, Mrs. Waterhouse.

24:05.362 --> 24:07.573
- It's time to go.
- Oh, my goodness.

24:10.784 --> 24:12.786
Hollis, Morrison and Douglas.

24:13.370 --> 24:14.788
One moment. Let me try one.

24:20.085 --> 24:21.879
And that's the real issue here.

24:21.879 --> 24:24.840
Now, the transportation authority
has provided us with this map,

24:24.840 --> 24:28.719
trying to show that going through
the West Adams neighborhood

24:28.719 --> 24:30.804
is going to be more beneficial
for the freeway.

24:30.804 --> 24:31.805
But in actuality,

24:31.805 --> 24:35.058
- anyone looking at this map...
- Hello, sir.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.816
- Found him.
- Let me see.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.944
Junior,
don't you think Mad should see first?

24:47.696 --> 24:48.697
Let's go.

24:53.744 --> 24:56.872
Linda and Charles Sloane Jr.,
you better stop where you are.

25:01.793 --> 25:03.212
Explain yourselves.

25:06.215 --> 25:09.760
If Mad had questions about Calvin,
why wouldn't she just ask me?

25:10.260 --> 25:13.639
What kind of answer do you want?
Vague moral support or honesty?

25:14.181 --> 25:15.224
Honesty, always.

25:16.391 --> 25:17.768
She probably didn't ask you

25:17.768 --> 25:20.020
because she knows
you don't like talking about him.

25:20.020 --> 25:23.232
But I've been talking with her
about Calvin since she was a baby.

25:24.399 --> 25:26.068
But she's not a baby anymore.

25:30.781 --> 25:31.990
God, I'm wiped.

25:32.824 --> 25:34.910
Did Charlie ever come around
on the protest?

25:36.370 --> 25:37.287
Not quite.

25:37.287 --> 25:42.960
But we've got an official flyer now.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.254
You mind passing these out
around the studio?

25:49.925 --> 25:53.011
Harriet, I can't come to the protest.
I'm so sorry.

25:53.887 --> 25:56.890
You know I would. If I could, I would.

26:00.602 --> 26:01.728
Déjà vu.

26:01.728 --> 26:04.815
It's the studio.
They didn't just suspend me.

26:04.815 --> 26:07.109
They suspended everyone.
And they'll do it again.

26:07.109 --> 26:08.944
But don't worry. I will make it up to you.

26:08.944 --> 26:10.028
Oh, my God.

26:11.238 --> 26:13.323
It's not about me. It's--

26:15.325 --> 26:18.662
It's not about Elizabeth and Harriet.

26:23.750 --> 26:27.671
This protest is about people all over
this country struggling to be seen,

26:27.671 --> 26:29.840
begging to be treated with dignity.

26:31.466 --> 26:33.844
You're always talking about the things
that keep women down.

26:33.844 --> 26:35.179
But who does that include?

26:35.762 --> 26:37.514
Have you looked at your audience lately?

26:38.098 --> 26:41.101
Now, I'm working my corner of the ring,

26:41.101 --> 26:45.480
but you--
you've got something almost no one has.

26:46.273 --> 26:49.818
You have a platform. What you say matters.

26:51.570 --> 26:53.739
And what you don't say
matters just as much.

26:55.991 --> 26:57.367
You wanna make it up to me?

26:58.160 --> 27:00.412
Think about the kind of person
you wanna be.

27:20.224 --> 27:21.683
Stay where you are.

27:32.694 --> 27:33.695
You had enough yet?

27:35.405 --> 27:36.615
What's it gonna be, huh?

27:37.407 --> 27:39.576
You had your fill of
disgracing this family?

27:40.160 --> 27:41.328
Yes, sir.

27:41.328 --> 27:42.704
I don't think you have.

27:42.704 --> 27:45.082
No, Dad. Please. No, Dad, please!

27:45.082 --> 27:48.502
Dad! Dad, please!

27:49.086 --> 27:54.299
Dad, please! Please! Please!
Please, Dad. Dad, please.

28:00.472 --> 28:01.390
Jesus Christ!

28:02.766 --> 28:03.600
Oh, J--

28:03.600 --> 28:05.936
John. No. No.

28:10.440 --> 28:13.151
No, John.

28:15.863 --> 28:16.697
Daddy?

28:17.698 --> 28:18.866
Daddy, what happened?

28:20.534 --> 28:21.743
He made his choice.

28:27.124 --> 28:31.795
I think that living a lie
will eat you up inside.

28:34.548 --> 28:36.049
And whatever hell is...

28:38.886 --> 28:40.387
must feel something like that.

28:50.314 --> 28:51.315
As you can see,

28:51.315 --> 28:54.151
- month after month, the numbers don't lie.
- Remarkable.

28:54.151 --> 28:56.111
I mean, look at this long-term ratio.

28:56.111 --> 29:00.616
Elizabeth, come over here and say hello
to Jameson from Swift & Crisp.

29:01.116 --> 29:04.870
We couldn't have done it without our girl.
And this is just the beginning.

29:04.870 --> 29:09.166
All right, places, everyone! Places!

29:09.666 --> 29:13.921
We're live in five, four, three... two, one.

29:16.590 --> 29:17.716
Before we begin,

29:17.716 --> 29:20.719
I would like to announce
a change to the Supper at Six program.

29:24.932 --> 29:28.227
Next Monday, we will be airing
a rerun instead of a new show.

29:30.354 --> 29:33.065
I will not be here with you
because I will be joining

29:33.065 --> 29:36.318
a peaceful protest
against the construction of a freeway.

29:36.318 --> 29:40.239
A freeway that threatens to tear apart
a thriving, predominantly Black community.

29:40.239 --> 29:42.324
What the fuck, Walter?

29:46.662 --> 29:49.581
So, in solidarity with the
thousands of other people

29:49.581 --> 29:52.709
who will be peacefully protesting
for their rights, I stand with you.

29:53.710 --> 29:55.504
Ed, could you please
bring the camera closer?

29:56.296 --> 29:58.632
Do not move that fucking camera.

30:01.218 --> 30:02.219
Ed, push in.

30:02.719 --> 30:04.221
Have you lost your mind?

30:10.602 --> 30:14.147
I hope you will join me.
And now, we may begin.

30:16.692 --> 30:17.776
Congratulations.

30:17.776 --> 30:19.653
- All right.
- Your star just flushed

30:19.653 --> 30:22.406
- both your careers down the toilet.
- Now, for today's show,

30:22.406 --> 30:24.491
we will be making pork ribs
with a dry rub.

30:25.492 --> 30:28.412
Notice how the flavors blend,
yet remain separate entities.

30:40.090 --> 30:41.967
That's four days suspension.

30:43.468 --> 30:44.720
22,300.

30:46.555 --> 30:47.723
I'm sorry, what?

30:47.723 --> 30:50.601
That is exactly how much
another four days will cost you.

30:51.101 --> 30:53.437
And now that we're exclusive
with Swift & Crisp,

30:53.437 --> 30:55.606
we have no other ad buys
to supplement reruns.

30:56.190 --> 30:58.108
I also know exactly how much
it would cost me

30:58.108 --> 31:02.905
to pay every crew member's salary
for four days, six days, a month.

31:03.906 --> 31:05.157
But you won't last that long

31:05.157 --> 31:07.701
before the entire studio's bottom line
is in in the red.

31:07.701 --> 31:09.620
If my research proves correct.

31:09.620 --> 31:12.456
- Listen, you can't--
- So, go ahead and suspend me.

31:12.956 --> 31:16.001
I won't feel it nearly as much as you will
in your bottom line.

31:24.510 --> 31:29.264
Save our homes! Fight the Freeway!

31:43.111 --> 31:46.073
- Fight the freeway! Fight the freeway!
- Save our homes!

31:46.073 --> 31:54.831
- Save our homes!
- Fight the freeway!

32:11.598 --> 32:13.475
This gathering is unlawful.

32:16.603 --> 32:19.940
Disperse now or you will be
in violation of the law.

32:21.275 --> 32:22.484
Stand strong.

32:40.335 --> 32:42.212
Disperse immediately.

33:16.163 --> 33:17.164
Clear 'em out!

33:20.709 --> 33:23.712
- All right.
- Take your hands off her.

33:24.796 --> 33:26.340
Get up. Get over here.

33:26.340 --> 33:27.966
Hey, get your hands off of her, man!

33:28.467 --> 33:30.719
Sanford! Sanford!

33:36.308 --> 33:38.101
He didn't do anything.

33:40.270 --> 33:42.189
We just wanna stay in our homes.

33:42.814 --> 33:44.233
We just wanna stay in our home--

33:49.821 --> 33:51.532
Please.

33:53.033 --> 33:54.660
Get over here. Come on.

33:54.660 --> 33:55.661
You, punk. Come here.

33:55.661 --> 33:58.664
- We wanna stay in our homes!
- Come on. Let's go.

33:58.664 --> 34:01.083
- Come on.
- Oh, no.

34:02.084 --> 34:03.961
Hey! This one.

34:04.920 --> 34:08.674
- Get that one.
- Come on. Come on.

35:02.853 --> 35:03.937
Is Sanford okay?

35:04.479 --> 35:05.606
He's all right.

35:05.606 --> 35:07.608
They roughed him up on his way in.

35:08.609 --> 35:12.029
Made me wait three hours
for no reason to pay his bail.

35:12.029 --> 35:14.698
But he's home safe with Agnes.

35:15.240 --> 35:16.241
Broken bones?

35:16.909 --> 35:18.202
Shiner on the brow.

35:21.830 --> 35:23.957
We should go there tomorrow.
We can bring them food,

35:23.957 --> 35:26.043
- take the kids off their hands--
- Harriet, can we just--

35:26.960 --> 35:30.964
Can you just sit here for a second, plea--
I just need a second.

35:33.175 --> 35:35.969
Yeah. I can sit.

35:55.489 --> 35:57.658
When I was sitting outside
the holding tank...

36:01.411 --> 36:07.125
I kept thinking what if it was you
instead of Sanford they got violent with.

36:07.125 --> 36:08.961
- But they didn't.
- But they could've.

36:11.880 --> 36:15.384
What about the next march?
The next sit-in?

36:18.720 --> 36:22.307
Do I worry about my job? Of course.

36:24.518 --> 36:27.521
We have worked so hard
for this life we've built.

36:29.356 --> 36:35.195
We deserve whatever happiness
and success that we can hold on to

36:36.446 --> 36:38.073
and that we can give to them.

36:40.158 --> 36:44.580
But what does it matter
if you're not here?

36:54.548 --> 36:57.217
Hey, I'm not going anywhere.

36:57.968 --> 37:02.139
I'm not going anywhere. I'm here.

37:06.101 --> 37:07.477
I'm here.

37:16.028 --> 37:21.867
"She must be a clairvoyant. Clairvoyant."

37:25.287 --> 37:26.288
Yes. Precisely.

37:27.289 --> 37:28.707
Can you read now?

37:31.752 --> 37:32.753
I can.

37:36.340 --> 37:38.300
But I'd like to talk with you
about something.

37:39.384 --> 37:42.179
It's my job to protect you
from anything that can hurt.

37:42.930 --> 37:47.017
But I can't protect you
from your feelings or mine.

37:48.352 --> 37:51.438
So, here goes.

37:55.192 --> 37:59.071
I miss your dad.

38:01.365 --> 38:05.869
I miss him so much that it's hard for me
to talk about sometimes.

38:07.538 --> 38:12.292
But you are teaching me that
not talking about the people that we miss

38:12.292 --> 38:13.836
does not make it better, I think.

38:15.045 --> 38:16.255
I think it makes it worse.

38:17.923 --> 38:19.716
I'm sorry I lied, Mommy.

38:22.135 --> 38:24.429
It's okay, bunny. It's okay.

38:28.475 --> 38:33.355
You know how you used to research
the origins of life?

38:35.315 --> 38:38.902
I wanted to do that too, but for me.

38:40.737 --> 38:44.658
I want to know my abio--

38:46.243 --> 38:47.953
abigen--

38:47.953 --> 38:49.454
Your abiogenesis?

38:56.670 --> 38:59.882
If you feel ready, will you show me
what you've learned about your dad?

39:02.759 --> 39:04.511
I'd like that very much.

39:20.444 --> 39:22.362
This is how I remember Dad.

39:26.658 --> 39:29.203
I found this magazine in Dad's study.

39:29.203 --> 39:31.788
I read it sometimes before I go to bed.

39:32.748 --> 39:33.749
Hold on.

39:46.220 --> 39:49.681
This is how I remembered
your uncle John when I was your age.

39:59.525 --> 40:00.567
Pistachio shells.

40:01.485 --> 40:02.736
Why?

40:04.363 --> 40:07.658
Your uncle John and I,
we used to light them on fire.

40:11.703 --> 40:15.624
Mad, will you show me what else you found?

40:16.625 --> 40:19.336
I also found this little toy
in one of his desk drawers.

40:19.336 --> 40:20.546
I've never seen that before.

40:20.546 --> 40:23.674
You try to get the ball into it.
That little hole there.

40:24.675 --> 40:26.426
It doesn't work easily.

40:26.426 --> 40:29.805
- You got it.
- Wakely, the case is hot.

40:33.642 --> 40:34.643
Read it.

40:35.227 --> 40:38.230
Linda and Junior stole these letters
from their mom's office.

40:38.814 --> 40:42.150
People asking my dad for money,
except this one person.

40:42.150 --> 40:44.111
Someone named Avery Parker.

40:45.195 --> 40:48.365
Get to the part where it mentions
St. Luke's in Modesto.

40:48.365 --> 40:51.410
How could this man know about St. Luke's?

41:01.879 --> 41:02.880
Mad...

41:05.883 --> 41:07.134
your dad is Calvin Evans?
