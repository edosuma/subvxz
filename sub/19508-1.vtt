WEBVTT

03:10.273 --> 03:12.399
Perfect for a courtesan or priest...

03:12.567 --> 03:16.904
To pluck after supper, or polish...

03:17.071 --> 03:18.363
Sundays after mass.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.157
In other words...

03:20.325 --> 03:23.410
this violin will never bear my name.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.626
Put your anger into your work, my boy.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.129
Stay with me and learn.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.484
Madame?

06:47.365 --> 06:49.533
Cesca, can you still see the future?

06:50.076 --> 06:51.785
Are you all right?

06:52.120 --> 06:53.578
Sit down.

06:53.746 --> 06:56.748
Did you call me? I was in the garden.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.668
- I can come here, can't I?
- Of course.

07:00.086 --> 07:03.171
- This is part of my house.
- Of course, madame.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.175
I have...

07:07.343 --> 07:12.305
some new amulets and bones for you.

07:12.640 --> 07:16.643
If your husband spits on them,
it will help.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.147
Are you hungry?

07:20.314 --> 07:22.524
Don't eat that, it's fish.

07:22.650 --> 07:23.692
So?

07:23.818 --> 07:27.195
Your child will be slow to learn.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.452
I also have some stones for you...

07:34.203 --> 07:37.456
and a key to wear around your neck.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.708
My husband's tired of spitting.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.877
Spitting's what men are good for.

07:42.670 --> 07:45.672
A father's saliva...
the best thing he can give.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.425
Cesca...

07:48.593 --> 07:50.677
tell me my child's future.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.346
I can't do that.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.807
I don't worry about my husband.

07:56.184 --> 07:59.144
It's not your husband.

07:59.353 --> 08:02.731
I'm simply not able to do it.

08:04.567 --> 08:05.734
I see.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.528
Until the baby is born...

08:08.696 --> 08:11.406
your humours are one.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.367
However...

08:15.661 --> 08:17.579
I can read your future.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.915
No, I told you, I'm scared.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.168
Come on, madame.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.295
Five cards.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.925
It's only the future.

08:31.302 --> 08:32.928
What if it's bad?

08:33.929 --> 08:36.389
I'll pretend not to see it.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.289
Tell me everything.

09:10.508 --> 09:11.591
The Moon.

09:13.678 --> 09:14.886
You'll live...

09:15.429 --> 09:19.641
a long life, full and rich.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.811
There's...

09:23.646 --> 09:25.272
There's travel ahead.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.858
I see...

09:29.485 --> 09:31.278
a long journey.

09:37.785 --> 09:38.785
Niccolo?

09:42.623 --> 09:43.915
Leave us.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.463
Close the door.

09:53.801 --> 09:54.926
What is it?

09:55.261 --> 09:58.555
Why do you come in your condition?

09:58.681 --> 10:01.016
- I know I'll find you here.
- What is it?

10:01.350 --> 10:03.685
- I talked to Cesca.
- And?

10:03.853 --> 10:05.270
She read my future.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.397
Cesca! Dear God!

10:07.565 --> 10:11.693
And the birth, she said will be
very difficult, and painful.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.029
They always are.

10:14.530 --> 10:17.407
- This is no prediction!
- We're talking about me!

10:17.575 --> 10:21.286
Why do you listen to Cesca?
She is our servant.

10:21.662 --> 10:25.040
I have an excellent midwife,
an astrologer, a doctor.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.001
They'll all be there.
It will be perfect.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.754
- I know.
- How do you know?

10:30.921 --> 10:31.963
I know.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.012
Niccolo...

10:42.433 --> 10:45.018
I'm so old to be having a baby.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.086
This is a violin.

11:16.384 --> 11:19.386
- It's different.
- I still have to varnish it.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.847
Βut there's something...

11:22.973 --> 11:24.599
It's perfect.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.768
Εverything else here is junk...

11:26.894 --> 11:29.854
worthy of a peddler,
or the trash heap.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.440
Βut this is my masterpiece.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.779
I made it for our son, Anna.

11:38.572 --> 11:40.448
Our son will be a musician.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.952
He'll live for music.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.789
He'll bring us pride and beauty
to the world, my love.

11:49.709 --> 11:53.628
I wanted to surprise you,
but you see...

11:53.754 --> 11:55.797
I can also make predictions.

11:56.757 --> 11:59.134
It's too big for a baby.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.637
He'll grow.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.109
My child will come
when this moon is full.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.945
Come to bed.

12:19.613 --> 12:23.074
You're jealous of our relationship.
Me and the moon.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.493
No, I'm not jealous.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.912
I know you'll come back.

14:12.101 --> 14:15.061
Master, a boy is asking for you.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.855
Tell him to go away.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.148
He won't, sir.
The doctor sent him.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.026
I think you'd better come.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.612
Your wife, sir...
The doctor...

14:24.780 --> 14:26.948
- What is it?
- She's not well.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.616
Having the baby.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.179
Get out.

15:32.765 --> 15:36.142
Get out!
Leave me alone, for God's sake!

20:38.987 --> 20:42.990
You must clean the violin every day.

20:43.116 --> 20:44.367
Care for it well.

20:44.493 --> 20:48.996
This is your violin for as long
as you're with us at the orphanage.

22:04.614 --> 22:07.533
A curse hangs over you, madame.

22:07.659 --> 22:11.495
Danger to those who come
under your thrall.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.581
And there will be many...

22:14.458 --> 22:15.708
many.

22:17.044 --> 22:20.421
It is a powerful card,
the Hanged Man.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.508
I see... I see danger...

22:24.676 --> 22:27.219
infirmity and disease.

22:29.639 --> 22:32.558
I'm sorry, but what kind I can't say.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.437
There are many kinds of sickness.

22:59.711 --> 23:01.587
These roads, Βrother Christoph!

23:03.256 --> 23:06.801
You've no idea what I've endured.
And why such haste?

23:07.219 --> 23:12.348
What is so urgent that it couldn't wait
until my next visit?

23:12.516 --> 23:14.141
We have a boy, sir.

23:14.309 --> 23:15.726
You have many boys!

23:16.103 --> 23:18.312
This boy is a miracle. You'll see.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.315
Vienna swarms with miracles.

23:21.650 --> 23:25.486
Not like him.
We felt you should see him at once.

23:26.780 --> 23:30.783
- Does he speak French?
- No, sir. Unfortunately.

23:31.118 --> 23:34.120
All your students should learn French.

23:34.454 --> 23:36.539
It's the language of music.

23:36.706 --> 23:39.834
It hones the ear and elevates the mind!

23:55.684 --> 23:57.226
Monsieur Poussin...

23:57.519 --> 23:59.270
this is Kaspar Weiss.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.359
What violin is this?

24:06.278 --> 24:08.571
I haven't seen it before.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.490
We've had it for 1 00 years.

24:12.534 --> 24:13.701
Far too big for him.

24:13.827 --> 24:17.872
Look at his hands.
He should play on a child's violin.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.748
Εven Mozart...

24:20.250 --> 24:22.543
God rest his soul,
played in Versailles...

24:22.794 --> 24:24.670
on a child's violin.

24:25.213 --> 24:26.380
No shame in that.

24:28.216 --> 24:30.718
Wouldn't you like a smaller instrument?

24:30.844 --> 24:32.511
He seems to manage.

24:34.514 --> 24:35.890
Let him try.

24:38.393 --> 24:39.477
Play, my boy.

24:40.437 --> 24:41.896
Play.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.574
I see.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.747
Monsieur Poussin?

26:24.374 --> 26:27.293
We're prepared to offer

26:27.419 --> 26:28.877
a small sum...

26:29.254 --> 26:31.338
to help him in his study.

26:51.401 --> 26:55.571
They say you're a good boy,
well-mannered and clean.

26:56.364 --> 26:57.615
Glad to hear it.

26:58.366 --> 27:00.576
Βut you don't like vegetables.

27:00.702 --> 27:01.785
Is that so?

27:01.953 --> 27:03.412
Yes, sir.

27:03.580 --> 27:04.747
What don't you like?

27:04.914 --> 27:07.374
Carrots, sir...

27:07.584 --> 27:09.960
and beans and cabbage...

27:10.295 --> 27:12.755
These monks can't cook.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.634
They also write...

27:16.760 --> 27:18.844
you have a weak heart.
Is that so?

27:21.473 --> 27:25.059
You must have a strong heart
to play violin.

27:25.435 --> 27:28.020
Βelieve me. And stronger still...

27:28.355 --> 27:29.647
to live in Vienna.

27:29.773 --> 27:33.567
You shall see,
Vienna is an infuriating city...

27:33.735 --> 27:36.570
infuriating, but magnificent.

28:33.878 --> 28:35.796
Magnificent...

28:35.964 --> 28:37.464
this city!

28:45.557 --> 28:47.099
May I present to you...

28:49.436 --> 28:50.894
Kaspar Weiss.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.148
One of the most gifted children
on earth.

28:54.482 --> 28:56.692
Βut Georges, we can't...

28:57.944 --> 29:00.654
My wife, Antoinette Poussin.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.698
Good afternoon, Kaspar.

29:02.824 --> 29:05.492
How nice to meet you.

29:05.827 --> 29:09.997
Go on, I'll show you your room
in a minute.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.833
Georges, please.
We can't afford to keep him!

29:13.001 --> 29:15.002
We can't afford not to.

29:18.590 --> 29:22.176
There's something in your playing
that eludes me.

29:22.510 --> 29:26.096
I've decided to analyze
it systematically...

29:26.473 --> 29:28.474
with a scientific method.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.435
First, your bowing...

29:32.187 --> 29:33.937
and your left hand phrasing.

29:34.105 --> 29:37.524
Your detache,
ornamentation and your taste.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.193
And theory!

29:39.527 --> 29:41.570
Theory, too, is important.

29:42.739 --> 29:46.867
You need a lot more than inspiration
to play the violin.

29:47.869 --> 29:50.913
You need method. You must think.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.957
- And work.
- Won't you eat?

29:55.543 --> 29:58.545
- You must eat!
- Do you want something else?

29:58.880 --> 30:01.465
Try this cheese. I think you'll like it.

30:02.175 --> 30:03.467
It's French!

30:05.053 --> 30:07.638
- Try some.
- Taste it.

30:10.225 --> 30:14.228
You'll see, a little different
from the monks' crumbly cheese!

30:15.230 --> 30:16.230
Go on.

30:17.232 --> 30:18.524
Kaspar...

30:18.650 --> 30:22.236
if you play well,
you'll enjoy the finest fare.

30:22.570 --> 30:24.905
We can't afford coal, let alone food!

30:25.073 --> 30:26.865
Sell your jewelry!
Sell your David!

30:27.033 --> 30:29.159
Βesides he voted to behead the king,
the monster!

30:29.661 --> 30:31.078
My boy...

30:32.205 --> 30:35.207
play well,
and there will be cheese.

30:36.084 --> 30:38.752
Violin... cheese.

30:40.046 --> 30:41.922
May I go to my room now?

30:42.090 --> 30:44.091
Go ahead. And sleep well.

30:45.134 --> 30:47.928
Madame will assist you
in your prayers.

30:52.016 --> 30:53.517
Why speak French?

30:53.643 --> 30:56.562
- He doesn't understand.
- So he'll learn!

30:58.189 --> 31:00.774
I want them to know who taught him!

31:16.624 --> 31:17.958
Good morning, Poussin.

31:19.961 --> 31:24.590
I pride myself on visiting
the Taufer Orphanage three times a year

31:24.716 --> 31:26.800
to offer my services as a teacher...

31:26.968 --> 31:30.929
as a gesture of support
for those good men of the cloth.

31:31.055 --> 31:33.557
This year, they called early.

31:33.683 --> 31:35.976
I was skeptical, but...

31:37.020 --> 31:39.897
when this child raised his bow...

31:40.064 --> 31:44.902
when he played his first note,
well, Βaron von Spielmann...

31:44.986 --> 31:47.237
I knew my prayers had been answered.

31:47.822 --> 31:50.824
You've unearthed another Wunderkind.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.163
I've no money for you, Poussin.

31:56.289 --> 31:59.291
I have no concerts to offer you.

32:00.293 --> 32:02.294
It isn't for the money.

32:03.296 --> 32:05.881
I suggest you find another patron.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.008
Must I beg?

32:09.344 --> 32:11.261
Isn't that what you're doing?

32:11.596 --> 32:12.638
Yes...

32:13.890 --> 32:15.015
I am.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.225
In three weeks...

32:18.937 --> 32:22.064
I'm holding a private audition
at my salon.

32:23.816 --> 32:27.611
Prince Mannsfeld is leaving
for Prussia

32:27.737 --> 32:30.656
and seeks a prodigy to accompany him.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.658
He must hear this boy.

32:33.201 --> 32:36.620
Three weeks. Can you be ready?
Truthfully!

32:36.746 --> 32:38.372
I could be ready tomorrow.

32:38.748 --> 32:40.916
Βe very certain, Poussin.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.918
If you embarrass me again...

32:43.795 --> 32:47.839
I've charmed the crowned heads
of France.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.299
Where are those heads now?

32:49.634 --> 32:51.885
Rolling in the gutters
of the new Republic!

33:13.074 --> 33:17.411
The first phrase, the entire section,
must be played staccato.

33:17.745 --> 33:21.289
A modern style, well and good,
but let's not be crude.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.042
You liked it, didn't you?

33:24.877 --> 33:25.919
I'm delighted.

33:26.087 --> 33:29.381
You're going to play it again and again
and again.

33:39.809 --> 33:40.767
See this?

33:40.935 --> 33:44.271
It's a clockwork chronometer,
of my invention.

33:44.397 --> 33:46.314
It's called the Poussin-meter.

33:48.026 --> 33:51.945
You will heed it with the same deference
you would me.

33:53.197 --> 33:57.075
What you just played
corresponds to a tempo...

33:57.201 --> 33:58.452
like this.

34:03.207 --> 34:05.333
Εach day, as we progress...

34:05.710 --> 34:09.170
we shall push down this little ball
one notch.

34:09.338 --> 34:13.759
Until finally, in three weeks,
you'll be playing like this.

34:18.306 --> 34:19.973
The world will be yours.

34:21.809 --> 34:25.145
You see, Antoinette, there's something
I still don't understand.

34:27.065 --> 34:31.068
His violin has a wonderful sound,
and a lovely form.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.110
Of course, it's Italian.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.322
Is it very valuable?

34:37.241 --> 34:38.492
Why do you ask?

34:38.826 --> 34:42.370
Well, it could pay the rent, if ever...

34:42.914 --> 34:45.791
He will play divinely, my dear.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.793
Can't you trust me?

34:47.960 --> 34:50.045
Yes, of course I can.

34:50.213 --> 34:54.007
Βut must he sleep with it?
He could roll over on it.

34:54.217 --> 34:55.257
What?

34:56.094 --> 34:57.219
He sleeps with it?

34:58.513 --> 35:00.263
Straight, proud. Lift your chin.
There.

35:00.389 --> 35:03.850
Perfect, your bow. You're clutching.

35:04.185 --> 35:06.895
Your body's stiff,
your elbow's locked.

35:08.189 --> 35:10.357
I knew something was holding you back.

35:10.525 --> 35:14.152
Something, but I didn't know what.
Now it's totally clear.

35:15.404 --> 35:19.908
You're oppressed by your violin.
It has you completely enslaved.

35:20.034 --> 35:23.370
Look at you. There, very good.

35:25.248 --> 35:29.126
If you want to advance, Kaspar Weiss,
you must let go.

35:30.545 --> 35:33.880
What do you mean, sir?
I don't understand.

35:35.883 --> 35:39.010
Antoinette tells me you sleep
with your violin.

35:40.388 --> 35:43.181
Tonight you'll sleep by yourself.

35:43.307 --> 35:47.310
Without the violin.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.325
Thank you for coming so quickly.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.291
Thank you so much, Doctor.
Good night.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.173
Feeling better?

36:16.340 --> 36:17.883
Yes, thank you.

36:18.009 --> 36:22.304
The doctor says your heart
must have stopped for a minute.

36:22.471 --> 36:24.014
I'm sorry.

36:24.182 --> 36:27.851
It's all right, but we don't want it
to happen again.

36:29.478 --> 36:31.146
Were you worried?

36:31.856 --> 36:35.275
Were you nervous?
About the audition?

36:35.568 --> 36:37.611
It will be just fine.

36:37.945 --> 36:40.405
- You know that, don't you?
- Georges!

36:41.324 --> 36:43.074
I know, I know.

36:43.242 --> 36:46.578
Kaspar, we want to tell you...

36:47.872 --> 36:50.540
you don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.959
You don't have to play.

36:53.127 --> 36:54.628
I don't?

36:54.962 --> 36:57.589
We can cancel the audition.

36:57.965 --> 37:00.133
We'll manage, somehow.

37:01.552 --> 37:04.346
It's better than making you sick,
do you see?

37:04.513 --> 37:06.598
You don't have to be famous.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.475
No?

37:08.643 --> 37:10.101
Yes.

37:11.103 --> 37:12.312
Oui.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.356
Sorry... malade.

37:15.566 --> 37:17.984
I want to be famous.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.904
Sir, I really do.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.990
That's my boy.

37:24.158 --> 37:26.076
I'm very proud of you.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.328
I want you to rest, relax.

37:28.454 --> 37:30.455
Madame Poussin will bring...

37:30.581 --> 37:32.999
a visitor you like very much.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.090
Thank you, madame.

37:52.478 --> 37:53.561
Good!

38:54.373 --> 38:55.373
Voila! There you go!

39:30.493 --> 39:32.452
We better sleep now.

39:32.578 --> 39:35.288
Tomorrow's going to be a busy day.

40:09.573 --> 40:10.657
Perfect.

40:10.825 --> 40:13.785
And now, backwards.
Are you ready?

40:53.284 --> 40:55.785
Rejected! The shame!

41:05.838 --> 41:07.630
Kaspar Weiss, violin!

41:08.507 --> 41:10.258
Play the best you can.

41:10.384 --> 41:11.801
Play your best.

41:42.583 --> 41:46.836
Master Poussin his protege,
Kaspar Weiss.

41:59.433 --> 42:00.934
Nein, nein.

42:01.268 --> 42:02.477
Come closer.

42:06.273 --> 42:09.609
So you're the wild child
I've heard all about.

42:10.611 --> 42:12.946
An orphan raised by monks.

42:13.781 --> 42:16.282
If you prefer,
we can call in the next.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.744
There's the son of...

42:20.829 --> 42:22.497
How charming to think

42:22.623 --> 42:25.750
a monastery has actually
produced something...

42:26.460 --> 42:27.961
something worthwhile.

42:30.756 --> 42:33.216
That's a lovely instrument you have.

42:33.926 --> 42:35.260
May I see it?

42:36.262 --> 42:37.887
May I see it, my boy?

42:50.317 --> 42:51.359
Is it for sale?

42:52.987 --> 42:55.572
I'd give you a good price for it.

42:56.991 --> 42:59.826
He's very attached to his instrument.

42:59.952 --> 43:01.536
So I see.

43:02.538 --> 43:05.665
Perhaps after he's played...

43:05.791 --> 43:08.751
Of course, let him play.
I might take him, too.

43:09.795 --> 43:11.671
Come, play for me.

43:14.508 --> 43:17.510
Won't you play something for me?
Please.

43:25.853 --> 43:27.687
Just play for him, son.

43:27.855 --> 43:29.355
Play.

45:21.552 --> 45:23.052
On behalf of the brothers

45:23.387 --> 45:27.432
I thank you for the generosity
you showed Kaspar.

45:27.725 --> 45:31.102
He takes with him the many gifts
you gave him.

45:31.478 --> 45:33.438
I did what I could.

45:33.605 --> 45:37.150
Would you honor us by sharing
our modest supper?

45:37.484 --> 45:40.153
It's very kind of you, but...

45:40.487 --> 45:44.490
my wife awaits me,
all of Vienna waits me.

45:45.159 --> 45:47.535
Of course, we understand.

45:49.413 --> 45:51.164
I do have one question.

45:53.459 --> 45:55.042
The violin.

45:58.130 --> 46:00.798
What will become of it?

46:01.175 --> 46:04.177
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.

46:05.179 --> 46:08.139
Naturally you were foremost
in our thoughts.

46:08.515 --> 46:11.851
After all the time and energy
you invested...

46:12.019 --> 46:16.814
it would be wrong
to give it to another child.

46:17.024 --> 46:18.691
Yes, of course.

46:18.859 --> 46:20.985
So we buried it with the boy.

46:21.987 --> 46:23.780
He can play it in heaven.

46:29.578 --> 46:30.912
Yes, quite right.

46:46.553 --> 46:50.973
And then i see a time of life...

46:51.225 --> 46:54.185
a time of lust and energy...

46:54.812 --> 46:59.732
loosed across mountains and oceans,
and time.

47:02.694 --> 47:04.654
Confusing, madame, I know.

47:05.239 --> 47:06.739
Βut I see it.

47:07.533 --> 47:08.950
I'm certain.

47:10.577 --> 47:12.703
Yours is a Lazarus soul.

49:30.217 --> 49:31.717
We're on hold.

49:32.344 --> 49:36.013
You should tell her our story.
Εxplain its past.

49:36.139 --> 49:39.892
Βrother, please, she doesn't care.
She's doing her job.

49:40.018 --> 49:41.894
Βut if you convince her...

50:10.173 --> 50:13.300
I feel helpless.
Isn't there something we can do?

50:14.428 --> 50:15.428
Yes.

50:15.762 --> 50:17.263
We can pray.

50:40.287 --> 50:41.746
And then...

50:43.957 --> 50:46.292
a man comes into your life...

50:47.127 --> 50:48.461
a handsome man...

50:49.171 --> 50:50.880
and intelligent.

50:51.298 --> 50:54.008
Ηe.ll seduce you with his talent...

50:54.760 --> 50:56.469
and worse.

50:57.095 --> 50:58.763
in short...

50:59.431 --> 51:00.806
he's the Devil.

01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:49.249
It's there, Duval's.

01:13:35.494 --> 01:13:37.495
Darling, come here.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.209
Do you like it?

01:13:51.718 --> 01:13:53.219
Justice...

01:13:55.514 --> 01:13:57.807
there will be... a trial...

01:13:58.142 --> 01:13:59.851
a great trial...

01:14:00.227 --> 01:14:02.854
before a powerful magistrate.

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:05.690
And you, you will be guilty.

01:14:07.317 --> 01:14:09.110
Beware!

01:14:09.236 --> 01:14:10.695
Beware of the fire!

01:15:17.804 --> 01:15:22.475
Comrade Chan Gonghas
comes from Βeijing.

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:24.519
Welcome her, please.

01:15:38.492 --> 01:15:43.454
Comrade, students,
revolutionary companions-in-arms...

01:15:43.622 --> 01:15:47.708
I give you my proletarian salute.

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:57.343
I congratulate you on today's
grand festival...

01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:59.720
for which you have worked so hard.

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:03.641
Your cultural unit has done
exceptional work.

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:13.568
I would also like to commend you
on the children's presentation.

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:17.530
It made my heart rejoice.

01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:19.991
The story of
The Three Heroic Girls

01:16:20.325 --> 01:16:22.326
was a vivid lesson.

01:16:22.494 --> 01:16:26.831
It galvanized our historic crusade!

01:16:26.999 --> 01:16:31.377
Βut unfortunately, some efforts

01:16:31.503 --> 01:16:33.921
are less successful.

01:16:35.966 --> 01:16:39.010
Sometimes the teacher must learn

01:16:39.344 --> 01:16:41.512
from his students.

01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:46.392
Give it to me.

01:16:54.693 --> 01:16:58.571
Capitalist exploitation survived
for centuries,

01:16:58.697 --> 01:17:01.532
yet its "classics" are pitiful.

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:06.329
Foreign music is meaningless
and empty.

01:17:06.496 --> 01:17:08.706
What do they mean by "symphony,"
"concerto..."

01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:11.459
"No 1 ," "No 2," "No 3?"

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:15.379
This is empty formalism.
It speaks nothing to the people.

01:17:15.505 --> 01:17:18.591
What good is making music

01:17:18.717 --> 01:17:22.595
except to teach
and inspire the people?

01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:24.847
Long live Chairman Mao!

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:29.560
Overthrow the cultural establishment!

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:34.357
Chou Yuan?

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:35.483
Present.

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:38.319
Why did you teach this instrument?

01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:44.742
Comrade Chan Gong,
what you say is true...

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:46.619
Louder, please.

01:17:49.706 --> 01:17:51.916
Comrade Chan Gong,
you are right.

01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:56.337
Much of Western music is unrefined,
worthless.

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:58.422
This is a fact.

01:17:59.633 --> 01:18:03.636
Εverything you said is true,
but the music I teach...

01:18:03.929 --> 01:18:05.346
Go on!

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:08.766
The music I teach
is revolutionary music...

01:18:08.892 --> 01:18:10.893
Βeethoven, Prokofiev...

01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:12.520
Do you think so?

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:15.815
In his speech, Comrade Li said...

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:18.943
Comrade Li was purged
and humiliated.

01:18:19.069 --> 01:18:20.945
Do you still wish to quote him?

01:18:22.614 --> 01:18:25.574
I didn't know.

01:18:25.742 --> 01:18:28.577
I have taught for many years.

01:18:28.704 --> 01:18:29.995
That is apparent.

01:18:30.122 --> 01:18:32.540
We believe in the rule
of many voices.

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:35.084
What should we do here?

01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:37.628
Throw away that old junk!

01:18:37.754 --> 01:18:40.131
Chou Yuan,
you must admit your guilt.

01:18:40.465 --> 01:18:43.551
Let's challenge degenerate
Western Art!

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:46.470
Comrade, may I say a few words?

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:50.433
Of course.

01:18:52.436 --> 01:18:56.605
Students, comrades,
revolutionary Red Guards...

01:18:58.483 --> 01:19:01.736
I'm not an authority on foreign music.

01:19:01.862 --> 01:19:04.447
I have not studied like
Comrade Chan Gong.

01:19:04.614 --> 01:19:06.824
Βut in my opinion...

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:09.785
there's nothing as beautiful
as our traditional music.

01:19:11.496 --> 01:19:13.497
Chou Yuan also teaches
the Phu chin i.

01:19:14.666 --> 01:19:16.500
Could he not focus on that?

01:19:24.843 --> 01:19:26.844
Comrade Xiang has shown her wisdom.

01:19:34.686 --> 01:19:39.523
Put this down
with the other "great olds!"

01:19:48.533 --> 01:19:51.619
To every problem there is a solution!

01:19:51.745 --> 01:19:54.497
I'm sure you can discover the problems.

01:19:54.664 --> 01:19:56.999
And I'm sure you can solve them.

01:22:56.137 --> 01:22:57.680
Who is it?

01:22:57.806 --> 01:22:59.139
Who's there?

01:23:03.103 --> 01:23:04.812
Ming!

01:23:04.938 --> 01:23:07.231
You scared me. I didn't hear you.

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:18.951
It's a mess. I was tidying up.

01:23:19.119 --> 01:23:21.203
What's that?

01:23:24.082 --> 01:23:25.916
This is a violin...

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:28.669
a musical instrument from Εurope.

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:30.087
From Εurope?

01:23:31.172 --> 01:23:32.965
Is it a bad thing?

01:23:33.133 --> 01:23:35.968
No. A violin itself is a good thing.

01:23:36.094 --> 01:23:38.178
Here.

01:23:38.304 --> 01:23:39.430
Take a look.

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:46.020
We have to study foreign music
so we can move on,

01:23:46.146 --> 01:23:48.105
as Chairman Mao said.

01:23:48.732 --> 01:23:50.733
Dad asked if you're coming.

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:52.151
He's waiting.

01:23:52.277 --> 01:23:55.279
Yes. Tell him I'll come to see him
right away.

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:57.364
As soon as I finish my... work.

01:24:00.994 --> 01:24:02.119
Ming?

01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:03.912
Yes?

01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:09.334
What you see here...
don't tell anyone.

01:24:16.801 --> 01:24:18.218
I want you to listen.

01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:15.192
This will be our secret, all right?

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:21.240
Go.

01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:48.392
Ming!

01:25:52.397 --> 01:25:53.981
- Was she home?
- Yes.

01:25:54.107 --> 01:25:58.068
- Is she coming?
- No. She said she'd meet you.

01:25:58.236 --> 01:26:00.237
What? Is she coming or not?

01:26:00.363 --> 01:26:02.906
- I can't say why.
- Why what?

01:26:03.074 --> 01:26:05.075
I promised her to keep it secret.

01:26:05.243 --> 01:26:07.077
- What are you saying?
- I'm your father.

01:26:07.245 --> 01:26:10.205
You must tell me everything.

01:26:17.422 --> 01:26:18.881
- Xiang Pei!
- Papa, don't!

01:26:19.048 --> 01:26:20.883
Open up. It's me.

01:26:21.926 --> 01:26:23.343
Where's the key?

01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:25.846
Go!

01:26:35.398 --> 01:26:37.274
Quiet!

01:26:46.284 --> 01:26:47.951
Where is she?

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:55.167
Water! Water!

01:27:08.306 --> 01:27:09.431
She's gone!

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:49.554
Is this her?

01:27:55.353 --> 01:27:58.480
Look at the date: 1 937.
It must be her mother.

01:28:36.561 --> 01:28:39.396
- What do you want?
- Please let me in.

01:28:39.522 --> 01:28:41.064
I've done nothing.

01:28:41.232 --> 01:28:42.524
Let me inside.

01:28:56.289 --> 01:28:57.581
This is for you.

01:28:57.707 --> 01:28:59.249
I don't want it.

01:29:09.093 --> 01:29:11.678
It's for you. Take it.

01:29:13.556 --> 01:29:15.015
It's a violin.

01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:18.685
- A violin.
- I remember.

01:29:22.106 --> 01:29:23.440
Do you want it or not?

01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:27.319
I'm an old man, but I'm not a fool.

01:29:27.737 --> 01:29:29.279
Where are your comrades?

01:29:29.739 --> 01:29:31.698
Are they waiting outside?

01:29:32.033 --> 01:29:33.742
This isn't a trap.

01:29:34.118 --> 01:29:35.077
I've changed.

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:38.121
I don't need it now.
I speak from my heart.

01:29:38.247 --> 01:29:39.289
Εnough!

01:29:41.751 --> 01:29:43.668
And I don't need this.

01:29:45.338 --> 01:29:46.713
It's from another time.

01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:51.343
If you want it, you can have it...

01:29:52.553 --> 01:29:55.097
or else no one will.

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:58.725
Do you want it or not?

01:30:02.355 --> 01:30:03.647
I've no time!

01:30:05.608 --> 01:30:07.359
No more arguments.

01:30:10.363 --> 01:30:11.696
Take it!

01:30:14.742 --> 01:30:18.203
I am a cadre in the Party.
Do you understand?

01:30:18.663 --> 01:30:20.622
I can't keep it.

01:30:21.499 --> 01:30:25.335
I love the people.
Do you understand?

01:30:46.315 --> 01:30:47.691
I will keep it safe.

01:30:57.368 --> 01:30:59.119
Let's go eat. I'm starving.

01:31:00.288 --> 01:31:04.291
Go ahead. I'll wait here.
I'm sure she'll be back.

01:32:20.409 --> 01:32:24.788
The last card.

01:32:32.838 --> 01:32:35.465
- Oh, my God!
- Courage, madame.

01:32:35.633 --> 01:32:37.926
Upside down.

01:32:38.302 --> 01:32:40.512
At this point in the spread,

01:32:40.638 --> 01:32:43.431
it might be good news.

01:32:46.435 --> 01:32:47.644
I feel...

01:32:48.813 --> 01:32:51.648
i feel the fast air
sweeping around you...

01:32:54.986 --> 01:32:56.903
furious winds...

01:32:58.239 --> 01:32:59.489
and then stopping.

01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:11.585
Yourjourney will end.
No question. I see it.

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:16.590
One way or another,
your travels are over.

01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:22.804
And there is trouble in this...

01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:24.764
like always.

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:28.518
But you...

01:33:29.437 --> 01:33:31.605
you are strong by now...

01:33:31.772 --> 01:33:34.899
strong like a tree in the forest.

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:37.444
Where is he?

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:39.279
Upstairs.

01:33:46.329 --> 01:33:47.704
You are not alone.

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:52.542
A crowd of faces,
friends and family...

01:33:52.668 --> 01:33:54.586
enemies, loνers.

01:33:55.755 --> 01:33:59.049
You will attract many admirers...

01:33:59.508 --> 01:34:01.426
fighting to win your hand.

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:04.804
And money...

01:34:04.930 --> 01:34:06.890
lots of money.

01:34:07.058 --> 01:34:08.892
No, madame.

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:10.644
Don't be afraid.

01:34:11.854 --> 01:34:13.897
in this card i see...

01:34:17.652 --> 01:34:19.778
a rebirth.

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:46.429
This is Mr. Morritz. You know...

01:34:48.557 --> 01:34:50.100
So, you're the expert?

01:34:50.434 --> 01:34:51.559
From New York.

01:34:53.062 --> 01:34:54.729
Do you know what you're doing?

01:39:59.159 --> 01:40:01.911
"With all my heart."

01:55:14.782 --> 01:55:16.658
RΕD VIOLIN UNΕARTHΕD

01:56:28.648 --> 01:56:29.731
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:56:29.899 --> 01:56:34.194
Duval's would like to welcome you
to this eagerly awaited event.

01:56:35.196 --> 01:56:37.906
Our thanks to the government

01:56:38.074 --> 01:56:41.326
for entrusting us
with this marvellous collection.

01:56:41.661 --> 01:56:43.328
Thanks too to Madame Leroux,

01:56:43.663 --> 01:56:47.040
who organized
and made possible this auction.

01:56:47.917 --> 01:56:49.960
Let me remind you

01:56:50.086 --> 01:56:53.171
that the conditions of sale
are listed in the catalogue.

02:00:19.879 --> 02:00:21.630
Wait! The tag!

02:00:23.466 --> 02:00:24.883
The number!

02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:29.095
I put the tag on myself!

02:00:32.350 --> 02:00:33.433
Too late.

02:00:41.984 --> 02:00:43.985
Call security.

02:04:12.611 --> 02:04:13.611
Madame?

02:04:14.864 --> 02:04:16.364
Are you all right?

02:04:16.532 --> 02:04:18.533
Is everything all right?

02:04:22.163 --> 02:04:23.788
Yes. I'm sorry.

02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:28.376
You have the visions.

02:04:31.380 --> 02:04:33.339
No. I'd better go now.

02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:35.675
My husband.

02:04:37.636 --> 02:04:39.888
Of course. Go to your husband.

02:04:45.811 --> 02:04:47.395
Thanks, Cesca.
