10:02.184 --> 10:04.186
- ♪ JUST DO IT ♪

10:04.270 --> 10:08.733

10:08.816 --> 10:11.694

NEXT.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.283
- WHEN CAN I EXPECT TO HEAR?

10:17.366 --> 10:18.534
- YOU JUST DID.

10:18.617 --> 10:19.660
SORRY, BUT WE KIND OF LIKE
THE NOTES WE WROTE.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.332
- GREAT.
I WAS NERVOUS BEFORE.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.166
NOW I'M ABOUT TO FREAK OUT.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.126
- DON'T FREAK.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.502
YOU SOUND GREAT.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.713
JUST ROCK THE MIC,
CARESS THE WORDS,

10:30.796 --> 10:31.714
AND BE THE SONG.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.299
- ROCK THE MIC.
CARESS THE WORDS.

10:33.382 --> 10:34.592
BE THE SONG.

10:34.675 --> 10:36.594
I FORGOT THE SONG.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.387
- YOU DID NOT FORGET THE SONG.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.680
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT COMES AFTER
"GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER."

10:39.764 --> 10:41.640
IS IT SOMETHING
ABOUT THE WEATHER?

10:41.724 --> 10:44.226
A FEATHER?
IT'S NOT LEATHER, IS IT?

10:44.310 --> 10:45.227

10:54.362 --> 10:56.572

THANKS, STEPH.

10:56.655 --> 10:58.199
- OKAY, LISTEN UP, EVERYONE.

10:58.282 --> 11:01.911
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT,
BUT WE'VE MADE OUR DECISION.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.079
- OH, MAN.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.206
- WAIT.
THIS ISN'T OVER.

11:05.289 --> 11:08.918
LOOK, I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR,
NOT LETTING EVERYONE AUDITION.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.796
SOME OF THESE KIDS HAVE WORKED
REALLY, REALLY HARD,

11:11.879 --> 11:14.840
AND ONE OF THEM IS
VERY TALENTED.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.092
- WHATEVER.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.260
WE'VE ALREADY FOUND
THE PERFECT PERSON.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.970
YOUR FIRST GIG'S SATURDAY.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.639
- WAIT. WHAT?

11:21.722 --> 11:22.932
- WE WANT YOU TO SING WITH US.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.101
YOU'RE EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.769
- ME.
REALLY?

11:26.852 --> 11:29.438
TO SING IN YOUR COLLEGE BAND
WITH COLLEGE KIDS, ME?

11:29.522 --> 11:32.441
- TWISTED MONSTERS NEEDS YOU.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.734
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

11:33.818 --> 11:36.821
- I SAY YES!

11:36.904 --> 11:37.613
NO.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.698
I COULDN'T.
COULD I?

11:39.782 --> 11:42.535
- IF YOU WANT IT,
YOU SHOULD TAKE IT.

11:42.618 --> 11:43.202
- I'LL TAKE IT.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.579
- YOU TOOK IT.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.039
OH, YAY.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.210
- HEY, SWEETIE.

11:51.293 --> 11:52.878
I'M MAKING SMOOTHIES.
DO YOU WANT ONE?

11:52.962 --> 11:55.423
- NO THANKS.
I FEEL LIKE A POPSICLE.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.507
- WELL, IF YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT THOSE LEMONY THINGS,

11:56.590 --> 11:59.135
STEPHANIE TOOK
THE LAST ONE.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.678
- UGH, OF COURSE SHE TOOK IT!

12:00.761 --> 12:03.639
SHE TAKES EVERYTHING!

12:03.722 --> 12:05.307
- THERE'S ICE CREAM SANDWICHES
IN THERE.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.726
- DAH, I DON'T WANT
YOUR OLD PEOPLE SNACKS.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.312
- I'M GONNA GO OUT
ON A LIMB HERE

12:10.396 --> 12:12.064
AND SAY THIS IS NOT
ABOUT FROZEN NOVELTIES.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.734
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY MAD
THAT STEPHANIE TOOK THAT GIG

12:15.818 --> 12:16.944
WITH THE BAND.

12:17.027 --> 12:18.487
WHY DON'T YOU GO TALK TO HER?

12:18.571 --> 12:20.781
- IF IT'S SO OBVIOUS,
WHY DO I NEED TO TALK TO HER?

12:20.865 --> 12:22.158
- YOU WANT ME TO DO IT?
- NO.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.659
IF SHE CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT
FOR HERSELF,

12:23.742 --> 12:24.452
THEN APPARENTLY MY FEELINGS
DON'T MATTER.

12:24.535 --> 12:27.788
- GABBY, IT'S NOT THAT.

12:27.872 --> 12:31.125
STEPHANIE'S JUST GOING THROUGH
SOME STUFF.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.043
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
ON MY SIDE, RIGHT?

12:33.127 --> 12:33.836
YOU CAN SEE THAT SHE'S WRONG.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.713
YOU CAN AT LEAST ADMIT THAT.

12:35.796 --> 12:38.757
- THEORETICALLY,
YOU ARE NOT WRONG

12:38.841 --> 12:41.969
ABOUT HER BEING NOT RIGHT.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.806
BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS,

12:45.890 --> 12:47.016
I'VE GOT BANANAS, MANGO,
AND PINEAPPLE.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.894
HOW ABOUT WE GET CRAZY
AND TOSS IN SOME KIWI?

12:54.273 --> 12:56.609
- HEY, YOU.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.402
GOT A MINUTE TO HELP ME
PICK OUT AN OUTFIT

12:58.486 --> 12:59.361
FOR THE TWISTED MONSTER SHOW?

12:59.445 --> 13:01.197
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:01.280 --> 13:03.741
BE HONEST.

13:03.824 --> 13:06.368
- HONESTLY, I DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU WEAR THAT ONSTAGE.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.621
- YEAH, I WASN'T
FEELING THAT, EITHER.

13:08.704 --> 13:11.290
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?

13:11.373 --> 13:12.416
- UH-UH, YOU DON'T WANT
TO LOOK LIKE

13:12.500 --> 13:15.211
YOU'RE TRYING TO STEAL
THE SPOTLIGHT.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.420
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.379
I WOULDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO THINK THAT.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.132
LAST ONE.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.342
- HI, HI, HI.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.010
- HEY, MOM.
- HEY, GRANDMA MAGGIE.

13:23.093 --> 13:23.719
- THAT WASN'T FOR Y'ALL.

13:23.802 --> 13:27.473
I SAID, "HI, HI, HI!"

13:30.684 --> 13:32.353
- AT YOUR SERVICE.

13:32.436 --> 13:33.437
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.813
WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU,
GRANDMA MAGGIE?

13:34.897 --> 13:36.565
- MY CAR NEEDS A WASH
AND A WAX.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.902
SUPPLIES ARE IN THE TRUNK,

13:39.985 --> 13:43.405
AND DON'T TOUCH
MY EMERGENCY BOX OF WINE!

13:44.990 --> 13:47.284
I MIGHT BE NEEDING THAT ONE DAY.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.744
- WHAT WAS THAT?

13:48.827 --> 13:50.579
- THEY WERE JUST BEING
GOOD GRANDCHILDREN.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.747
WHAT'S THIS?

13:51.830 --> 13:53.457
- OH, GABBY'S HELPING ME
PICK OUT AN OUTFIT

13:53.541 --> 13:54.458
FOR MY FIRST GIG.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.210
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.087
YOU'RE STILL DOING THAT?
- YEAH.

13:58.170 --> 14:01.590
- WELL, IF YOU NEED ANYTHING
STEAMED, IRONED,

14:01.674 --> 14:04.802
I GOT A GUY AND A LITTLER GUY.

14:06.679 --> 14:10.099
CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THAT DAUGHTER OF MINE?

14:10.182 --> 14:11.433
- I KNOW.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.102
I JUST DON'T GET
WHAT STEPHANIE'S THINKING.

14:13.185 --> 14:16.438
- I MEAN, EVERY OUNCE OF TALENT
THAT STEPHANIE'S GOT

14:16.522 --> 14:18.857
WAS PASSED DOWN
FROM HER MOTHER.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.237
I MEAN, IF ANYBODY
IS GONNA BE ONSTAGE,

14:23.320 --> 14:25.114
IT SHOULD BE ME.

14:28.659 --> 14:33.914
♪ YOU BETTER GET
YOUR ACT TOGETHER ♪

14:33.998 --> 14:36.709

A HUGE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE

14:49.847 --> 14:50.889
FALLS INTO PLACE.

14:56.729 --> 14:57.688
- CAN'T DO IT.

14:57.771 --> 14:59.607
CANNOT FOLD GRANNY PANTIES.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.902
FACE IT, AARON.
THIS GRANDMA IS NOT PAYING OFF.

15:03.986 --> 15:07.656
I SAY WE CUT OUR LOSSES WHILE
WE STILL HAVE SOME DIGNITY.

15:07.740 --> 15:12.411
- MY DIGNITY WAS GONE
WHEN I STARTED THAT BACK RUB.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.413
- OH, BOYS!

15:14.496 --> 15:16.457
- [sighs]

15:18.417 --> 15:19.043
LISTEN, GRANDMA MAGGIE--

15:19.126 --> 15:19.752
- I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.503
- IS IT A VIDEO GAME?

15:21.587 --> 15:23.881
- OPEN IT.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.466
- A ROCK?

15:25.549 --> 15:29.845
- I LOVE ROCKS!

15:29.928 --> 15:32.723
- IT'S A PUMICE STONE...

15:32.806 --> 15:35.434
FOR MY FEET.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.146
GO ON.
CHECK OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.776
- HALF A 50 DOLLAR BILL?

15:43.859 --> 15:47.154
- 25 BUCKS.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.156
- IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.824
WHEN DO WE GET THE OTHER HALF?

15:50.908 --> 15:54.620
- WHEN I CAN SEE MY REFLECTION
IN MY HEELS.

15:57.539 --> 16:01.043
- OKAY, SO I'VE NARROWED IT DOWN
TO TWO DRESSES FOR THE GIG.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.086
WHICH ONE?

16:02.169 --> 16:03.545
- THE ONE ON THE LEFT.

16:04.672 --> 16:04.963
- WHAT COLOR WAS IT?

16:06.924 --> 16:10.094
- YOU KNOW, IT WAS BLUEY
GREENISH RED-Y

16:10.177 --> 16:10.928
KIND OF THING.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.721
- THEY'RE BLACK, CHARLIE.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.557
THEY'RE BOTH BLACK.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.101
GABBY TOLD ME TO GO
WITH THIS ONE.

16:17.184 --> 16:18.852
- DID SHE TELL YOU WHERE TO GO
WITH THAT ONE?

16:18.936 --> 16:22.898
- WELL, THAT CAME OUT
OF NOWHERE.

16:22.981 --> 16:24.358
- NOT REALLY.

16:24.441 --> 16:27.403
ARE YOU SURE GABBY'S COOL
WITH YOU DOING THIS GIG?

16:27.486 --> 16:28.862
- HONEY, I'VE ASKED HER
A BUNCH OF TIMES.

16:28.946 --> 16:29.822
SHE'S FINE.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.031
- SHE IS?
- YEAH.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.783
SHE'S FINE.
I'M FINE.

16:32.866 --> 16:35.911
EVERYBODY'S FINE
EXCEPT YOU, APPARENTLY.

16:35.994 --> 16:37.871
- I JUST CAN'T HELP WONDERING
WHY YOU WANT TO BE UP THERE

16:37.955 --> 16:39.164
WITH A BUNCH OF KIDS.

16:39.248 --> 16:43.502
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
A WOMAN OF MY AGE?

16:43.585 --> 16:45.504
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

16:45.587 --> 16:46.922
- YOU WERE THINKING IT.

16:47.005 --> 16:48.340
- OH, WE'RE ALL THINKING IT.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.050
- EXCUSE ME?

16:50.134 --> 16:52.553
- I'M JUST SAYING THAT MAYBE
THE GRACEFUL PART

16:52.636 --> 16:54.763
OF AGING GRACEFULLY

16:54.847 --> 16:57.015
DOES NOT INCLUDE SINGING
WITH TWISTED MONSTER.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.435
- UGH, YOU ARE SO OUT OF TOUCH,
CHARLIE,

16:59.518 --> 17:02.020
BUT NOWHERE NEAR OUT OF TOUCH
AS YOU'RE GONNA BE TONIGHT

17:02.104 --> 17:04.940
IN OUR BED
WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN IT.

17:05.022 --> 17:07.108
- HEY, IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT
AND EMBARRASS YOURSELF,

17:07.192 --> 17:08.359
YOU HAVE MY PERMISSION.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.319
- HEY, IF WANT TO GO OUT
AND EMBARRASS MYSELF,

17:10.404 --> 17:13.406
I DON'T NEED YOUR PERMISSION.

17:13.490 --> 17:14.241
MM...OH.

17:19.663 --> 17:22.958
WOW, MY PEEPS
REALLY TURNED OUT TONIGHT.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.292
EXCUSE ME.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.794
MY BAND NEEDS ME.

17:25.877 --> 17:26.962
- BREAK A LEG.

17:27.045 --> 17:29.923
- WHY STOP AT ONE?

17:30.007 --> 17:32.259
- JUST GOT TO DO
A QUICK MIC CHECK.

17:32.342 --> 17:33.385
- WOW, YOU GUYS LOOK GREAT.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.387
I HAD NO IDEA
WE WERE DOING COSTUMES.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.139
I DIDN'T BRING ANYTHING.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.849
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE'VE GOT YOU COVERED.

17:38.932 --> 17:40.976
- OH, SCHOOLGIRL OUTFIT?

17:41.059 --> 17:41.643
THAT'S A LITTLE NAUGHTY.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.980
I CAN TOTALLY ROCK THAT.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.069
WHO GOES TO SCHOOL IN THESE?

17:51.153 --> 17:52.070
- NOBODY.
YOU'RE THE MOM.

17:55.324 --> 17:58.285
- "TWISTED MOMSTERS"?

17:58.368 --> 17:59.661
YOU CHANGED IT?

17:59.745 --> 18:01.038
- I MEAN, WE'D BEEN LOOKING
FOR A NEW GIMMICK,

18:01.121 --> 18:02.748
AND WHEN WE SAW SOMEONE YOUR AGE
AT THE AUDITION,

18:02.831 --> 18:04.458
IT ALL CLICKED.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.086
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
BEFORE NOW?

18:07.169 --> 18:09.171
- WELL, WE WERE SORT OF AFRAID
YOU WOULDN'T SHOW UP.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.756
I KNOW MY MOM WOULDN'T.
- [laughs]

18:10.839 --> 18:11.840
- WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.384
I WOULDN'T HAVE SHOWN UP.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.387
FIND SOME OTHER OLD HAG.
[echoing]

18:18.597 --> 18:21.183
- MIC WORKS.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.852
- I WISH YOU WOULD'VE
JUST TOLD HER

18:23.936 --> 18:25.270
HOW YOU FELT
FROM THE BEGINNING.

18:25.354 --> 18:28.524
GABBY, SOMETIMES IT'S IMPORTANT
TO BE DIRECT WITH PEOPLE.

18:28.607 --> 18:29.566
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:29.650 --> 18:32.778
- [sighs]

18:32.861 --> 18:34.696
- STEPHANIE, I'M GLAD
YOU GOT HUMILIATED IN PUBLIC.

18:34.780 --> 18:35.697
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE STOLEN
MY GIG.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.283
- NOT THAT DIRECT.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.369
- WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM,
GABBY?

18:40.452 --> 18:42.120
YOU SAID YOU WERE FINE
WITH THIS.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.539
IF YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME
HOW YOU FELT,

18:43.622 --> 18:44.706
I WOULD'VE NEVER TAKEN
THE GIG.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.000
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE NEEDED
TO TELL YOU.

18:47.084 --> 18:50.879
WHAT PART OF PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE
DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?

18:50.963 --> 18:53.507
- OKAY, WHAT DID I DO
THAT WAS SO WRONG?

18:53.590 --> 18:54.758
ALL I DID WAS GO
TO YOUR AUDITION

18:54.842 --> 18:57.219
AND SING YOUR SONG
AND TAKE THE GIG YOU WANTED--

18:57.302 --> 18:58.512
OH, BOY, THAT'S BAD.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.722
- YOU THINK?

19:00.806 --> 19:03.350
- GABBY, I AM SO SORRY.

19:03.433 --> 19:07.521
IT JUST FELT LIKE I WENT
FROM "IT" GIRL TO OLD LADY

19:07.604 --> 19:08.897
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.357
