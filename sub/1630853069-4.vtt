WEBVTT

00:06.548 --> 00:09.467
So, I have to marry
a complete stranger?

00:11.636 --> 00:13.012
Well, yes.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.849
He's not some derelict.

00:16.474 --> 00:17.392
He has money.

00:17.475 --> 00:20.729
I just--
I thought that
when I did marry...

00:21.312 --> 00:22.063
it could be for love.

00:24.649 --> 00:28.153
Peasants marry for love.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.071
Mary has acreage.

00:34.701 --> 00:35.535
(both sigh)

00:37.454 --> 00:39.372
I'm Stede, by the way.

00:39.456 --> 00:44.586
-I know. Mary.
-Stede: Oh, yes.

00:44.669 --> 00:45.754
I know.

00:47.797 --> 00:51.509
Consider...
the humble lighthouse.

00:51.593 --> 00:55.889
A beacon, an unwavering
light that guides.

00:55.972 --> 00:59.851
And you shall be
that for each other.

00:59.934 --> 01:02.395
(horn blows)

01:02.479 --> 01:04.522
For eternity.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.319
(light applause)

01:09.402 --> 01:12.655
Mother Bonnet:
Oh, congratulations!

01:12.739 --> 01:16.034
We've purchased something
for your big day.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.076
A gift!

01:18.828 --> 01:20.747
-Mary: Oh! Graves.
-Stede: Huh.

01:20.830 --> 01:23.374
-Mother Bonnet: Yes!
-Wow.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.377
(light classical music plays)

01:26.461 --> 01:29.130
(clattering)

01:30.715 --> 01:33.343
(children laughing)

01:33.718 --> 01:35.512
Stede?

01:35.595 --> 01:38.181
-(laughter continues)
-Mary: Stede?

01:38.264 --> 01:39.933
-(girl screams)
-Mm-hm?

01:41.184 --> 01:43.019
Will you please play
with your children?

01:43.102 --> 01:44.103
Mm-hm.

01:46.856 --> 01:47.982
(playful screaming,
laughter continue)

01:48.066 --> 01:50.777
And don't play
pirates with them.

01:50.860 --> 01:52.195
They'll have
nightmares again.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.497
-Rawr!
-(screaming)

02:02.580 --> 02:03.331
Ha, ha!

02:03.414 --> 02:06.000
I'm the greatest
pirate that ever lived.

02:08.253 --> 02:09.671
-Ah! Please!
-(children laughing)

02:09.754 --> 02:12.465
Any last words, dog?

02:12.549 --> 02:13.508
Spare me!
I have a family.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.802
Sorry, boy-o.

02:15.885 --> 02:19.681
Scoundrels
spare no one!

02:19.764 --> 02:22.016
Girl's voice:
And that's how
we treat pirates.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.645
Mary, we were just
playing pirates.

02:25.728 --> 02:29.440
(somber music playing)

02:42.579 --> 02:44.664
(children laughing)

02:44.747 --> 02:47.500
(lively classical music plays)

02:47.584 --> 02:49.586
(waves roaring)

02:51.963 --> 02:54.215
Been lookin'
for you everywhere.

02:54.299 --> 02:57.218
We need to move quickly,
before the Spanish realize

02:57.302 --> 02:59.262
we've massacred
all their men.

02:59.345 --> 03:02.056
Oh, the Spanish.
They die quite dramatically,
don't they? The Spaniards?

03:02.140 --> 03:04.559
Lots of blubbering
for their God.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.185
Yeah, agreed.
Now, we really
should discuss--

03:06.269 --> 03:10.023
Izzy, Izzy, Izzy, Izzy, Izzy.
Look out there. Those clouds.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.400
Do they look like
frankfurters to you?

03:12.483 --> 03:15.486
They look like clouds, boss.
Can we just focus on--

03:15.570 --> 03:17.071
Yes, yes, they look like clouds

03:17.155 --> 03:19.407
because they
are indeed clouds,

03:19.490 --> 03:22.827
but if you just put
some fucking imagination
into it, man.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.500
I suppose they
look like sausages.

03:29.584 --> 03:33.254
Frankfurters, yes.
Exactly.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.840
It's like pulling teeth
with you sometimes, man.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.760
Let's get to it.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.428
What've we got here?

03:42.513 --> 03:46.225
Izzy:
Well, the ship sustained
some damage in the crossfire,

03:46.309 --> 03:48.770
and the crew's
completely useless,

03:48.853 --> 03:50.605
-bottom of the barrel.
-Mm-hm.
What's the plan for them?

03:50.688 --> 03:53.066
The uszh...

03:53.149 --> 03:55.735
make 'em repair the ship,
execute 'em.

03:55.818 --> 03:58.488
-Right... the uszh.
-Hm.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.660
Black Pete:
I bet he's saying
something genius.

04:03.743 --> 04:06.120
He's history's most
brilliant tactician.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.456
I wonder if
he'll recognize me.

04:08.539 --> 04:10.083
You know,
I thought he'd be taller.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.794
-Shush.
-Ah! Fuck!

04:12.877 --> 04:14.295
Back to work.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.296
Blackbeard:
Boys, boys, boys, hey.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.549
Let's not brutalize
our guests like that.

04:18.633 --> 04:19.342
(Black Pete wheezing)

04:21.511 --> 04:24.472
-Pirate: Fuck, yeah! Whoo!
-(cheers and applause)

04:26.057 --> 04:29.227
Hello, everyone.
I'm Blackbeard.

04:29.310 --> 04:32.021
Huge fan, sir.
Huge.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.565
Well, that's lovely,
but you don't need
to say sir, all right?

04:34.649 --> 04:35.733
It's just Blackbeard.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.653
-Yes sir, Blackbeard, sir!
-Nice to meet you.

04:38.736 --> 04:41.823
Hello. Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Hi, how are ya?

04:41.906 --> 04:43.992
Hey. I love all the rope.
Everyone's wearing rope.

04:44.075 --> 04:47.203
Everyone's grubby, as well.
Filthy.

04:47.286 --> 04:48.538
Look at this bunch!

04:48.621 --> 04:50.915
Wild characters
on the high seas.

04:52.583 --> 04:53.584
(laughs)

04:54.711 --> 04:56.337
-Izzy...
-(bird squawking)

04:56.421 --> 04:57.964
Izzy, come here.
They've got a bird guy.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.341
Look at this thing.

05:00.425 --> 05:04.303
-Hello.
-Karl conveys his
warm regards, Captain.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.765
-And Karl's the bird, yeah?
-Karl's the bird.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.435
-Karl's the bird.
-Sorry, sir, Blackbeard, sir.

05:10.518 --> 05:13.938
I was just wonderin'
if we're gonna be able
to live or die--

05:14.022 --> 05:15.023
(shouts):
Right, come on!

05:15.106 --> 05:18.818
Blackbeard has
business to attend to!

05:18.901 --> 05:20.737
-Fang!
-(hisses) Back to work!

05:20.820 --> 05:23.322
Oh! Jesus!

05:23.406 --> 05:26.367
Blackbeard:
Izzy, why don't we
have a bird guy?

05:33.958 --> 05:37.211
(light harpsichord playing)

05:45.344 --> 05:46.220
Mary:
Ready?

05:46.304 --> 05:49.640
-Happy anniversary, darling.
-(gasps)

05:49.724 --> 05:53.811
Oh... look at that.
What is it?

05:54.812 --> 05:56.022
It's a painting...

05:56.814 --> 05:58.858
-of the lighthouse.
-Mm-hm.

05:58.941 --> 06:01.527
-From our wedding.
-(gasps) Yes!

06:01.611 --> 06:03.029
We are to be
lighthouses

06:03.112 --> 06:04.655
-for each other, remember?
-That's right.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.908
-Yes.
-Yeah, yeah.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.077
And the children did that?

06:09.160 --> 06:10.995
Oh gosh, they're good.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.206
-I painted it.
-But they-- Hm?

06:13.956 --> 06:15.249
-You did?
-Yep.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.877
Yes, absol--
Oh, you can tell.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.048
Wait! Et voila!

06:24.842 --> 06:26.219
What do ya think?

06:28.721 --> 06:33.226
-It's a toy?
-It's a model of a ship.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.269
What would you say
to living on something
like that?

06:37.021 --> 06:41.692
You, me, the kids...
at sea.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.694
Why on Earth
would we do that?

06:43.778 --> 06:44.821
I don't know.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.240
Break the monotony.

06:48.991 --> 06:50.910
Our life feels
monotonous to you?

06:52.453 --> 06:53.871
No!

06:53.955 --> 06:54.872
No, it doesn't,
does it?

06:55.832 --> 06:58.376
Um...
I just think that...

06:58.459 --> 07:00.962
(sighs)
why waste our time here,
day after day,

07:01.045 --> 07:03.923
doing the same
old thing...

07:04.006 --> 07:04.799
when we could
be doing this!

07:04.882 --> 07:07.135
We could be on a ship
having adventures.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.804
Do you know
I hate the ocean?

07:09.887 --> 07:12.265
-I said so just the other day.
-What? When?

07:12.348 --> 07:14.350
When we were standing
by the fucking ocean!

07:14.433 --> 07:15.935
I don't want
a boat, Stede!

07:16.018 --> 07:18.855
And I don't
hate our lives!

07:18.938 --> 07:20.481
At least, not so much that
I would wanna do this!

07:25.403 --> 07:27.363
-I'll get it stopped.
-Get what stopped?

07:31.075 --> 07:33.452
-I mean--
-Get what stopped?!

07:33.536 --> 07:35.913
-Nothing.
-You're not having
this built, are you?

07:35.997 --> 07:38.958
No... No, th-this
is just an idea.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.334
This is it. I'm sorry.

07:41.919 --> 07:43.963
That's it.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.715
Blackbeard:
This place is amazing.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.592
Izzy, look, look at this shit.

07:47.675 --> 07:48.718
(giggles)

07:48.801 --> 07:50.136
Look at that!

07:50.219 --> 07:52.388
It's a teeny-tiny
version of this ship.

07:52.471 --> 07:53.806
It appears so, yeah.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.934
-So, Edward--
-He's got all sorts
of knick-knacks

07:57.018 --> 07:58.436
-and trinkets.
-Edward?

07:58.519 --> 08:00.479
-This guy's fucking fascinating.
-Edward, focus.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.231
-We need a plan.
-I'm trying on focusing.
I'm focusing

08:02.315 --> 08:04.525
-on all of this brilliant stuff.
-Edward, we really need a plan.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.360
-Crazy little trinkets.
-Come on, a plan.

08:06.444 --> 08:09.030
Yes! We always need
a fuckin' plan, all right?!

08:09.113 --> 08:10.489
And then what?
Then we fuckin'
execute the plan,

08:10.573 --> 08:11.866
then we get another plan,
then what do we do?

08:11.949 --> 08:13.117
We execute that,
and so on, and so on,

08:13.201 --> 08:14.744
and again, and again,
and again, and again.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.787
It's all so fucking boring!

08:18.331 --> 08:20.499
(heavy sigh)

08:20.583 --> 08:24.295
I'm bored out of my skull, man.
Is this all there is?

08:24.378 --> 08:26.464
I shouldn't be bored.
I'm fucking Blackbeard.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.799
Well, as bored as you might be,
if you don't make
a decision soon,

08:28.883 --> 08:29.383
we're gonna
fuckin' die.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.721
(contemplative music plays)

08:33.804 --> 08:36.557
Ooh, now, there's an idea.
I haven't done that yet.

08:36.641 --> 08:38.392
â™ª

08:39.894 --> 08:41.229
I haven't died yet, have I?

08:44.106 --> 08:44.607
Maybe we should try that.

08:51.781 --> 08:52.114
Do, do wh-what?

08:52.198 --> 08:54.158
(door closes)

08:54.867 --> 08:55.618
Yeah, 'cause that makes sense.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.833
So, we're thinkin' they're
gonna kill us, yeah?

09:02.917 --> 09:05.753
I would if I were them.
Look at us.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.632
Ugh... God.

09:11.175 --> 09:14.178
(speaks Spanish), huh?

09:14.262 --> 09:15.596
You've been lookin'
at me all day.

09:16.931 --> 09:20.184
So, this whole time
you were a woman?

09:20.935 --> 09:23.062
Yeah... I guess.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.230
I don't know.

09:24.313 --> 09:25.398
And you're not a mute?

09:25.982 --> 09:27.567
No, I'm not a mute.

09:29.318 --> 09:31.112
I did not see
that coming...

09:31.195 --> 09:33.447
at all.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.324
Buttons:
Found somethin' youse
might wanna look at.

09:35.408 --> 09:39.287
These wee black dots
look about Spanish to me.
What do you think?

09:41.205 --> 09:41.497
Izzy:
Right.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.626
Fuck.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.505
Fuck, fuck...

09:49.588 --> 09:50.589
Hola.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.012
Mary?

09:57.930 --> 10:01.475
-(whimpers)
-Who's this Mary then?

10:01.559 --> 10:02.852
Lucius:
Hey, Stede, I really
hope you're not dead

10:02.935 --> 10:03.936
'cause things
have taken a very--

10:04.020 --> 10:05.813
Oh, u-um...

10:05.896 --> 10:06.981
S-Sorry, uh, didn't
mean to bother you.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.899
No bother.

10:09.525 --> 10:11.319
Tell me, can you count?

10:11.402 --> 10:13.654
-Y-Yes. (scoffs)
-Backwards.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.074
Um...

10:17.074 --> 10:18.159
Sh-- Yes.

10:18.242 --> 10:18.909
I want you to start
counting back

10:18.993 --> 10:20.703
from one hour
forty-seven minutes,

10:20.786 --> 10:21.871
and I want you to start...

10:22.830 --> 10:24.999
-Now.
-Sixty, 59...

10:25.082 --> 10:27.626
58... 57...

10:27.710 --> 10:29.670
-56...
-Good, keep going.
Come find me when you're done.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.505
52, 53--
Oh god, shit.
50--

10:31.589 --> 10:34.133
Blackbeard:
And fetch us
a cold rag, would you?

10:34.216 --> 10:36.802
Absol-- Yes!
Whatever you want, sir.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.554
Fif-- Uh, 49, 48...

10:41.015 --> 10:42.266
Coward.

10:44.101 --> 10:45.686
I was a coward.

10:53.736 --> 10:53.819
Stede?

10:56.238 --> 10:58.199
I know you're unhappy.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.534
I'm unhappy, too.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.871
-I'm not unhappy.
-No?

11:03.954 --> 11:06.749
Sometimes, I think I--
I've heard you crying.

11:08.542 --> 11:09.543
By yourself?

11:11.545 --> 11:12.588
Uh... no.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.217
It's probably the wind...

11:16.300 --> 11:17.760
you're hearing...

11:17.843 --> 11:19.678
or an owl.
Might be an owl.

11:21.639 --> 11:25.059
I know we never
would've chosen
each other,

11:25.142 --> 11:27.353
not in a million years,

11:27.436 --> 11:30.815
but... all we have
is this one life.

11:30.898 --> 11:34.902
We have to try, don't we?
Otherwise, what's the point?

11:41.742 --> 11:43.160
(snoring)

11:47.498 --> 11:48.624
(snoring continues)

11:54.505 --> 11:55.756
(snoring continues)

12:00.970 --> 12:03.431
â™ª

12:08.144 --> 12:10.354
(whispers): Mary?

12:11.355 --> 12:12.565
Mary?

12:22.992 --> 12:24.618
Dearest Mary...

12:24.702 --> 12:27.621
You deserve happiness,
as do I.

12:27.705 --> 12:31.375
My hope is that the vast
wealth and property

12:31.459 --> 12:33.461
I leave behind
for you and the children

12:33.544 --> 12:34.628
will suffice.

12:34.712 --> 12:38.299
I've sold an acre or two
for my own needs,

12:38.382 --> 12:39.967
but the rest is yours.

12:40.050 --> 12:44.638
You're quite right.
We only have this one life.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.600
Fond regards,
Stede.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.983
Mary:
You are such...
a disappointment.

12:56.066 --> 13:00.821
-Mary?!
-Did you really think
a letter was enough?

13:00.905 --> 13:05.159
-Oh, Mary. I've been stabbed.
-Yes... Congrats.

13:05.242 --> 13:08.078
I mean, piracy?

13:08.162 --> 13:10.331
You left me to be...
a pirate?

13:10.414 --> 13:14.543
It's not you. It was me.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.046
I was just uncomfortable
in a married state.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.006
-Father Bonnet: A pirate?
-Ah!

13:19.089 --> 13:23.344
He was scared of geese,
for Christ's sake.
(laughs)

13:23.427 --> 13:25.804
(geese honking)

13:25.888 --> 13:27.348
Goodbye, Stede.

13:27.431 --> 13:28.974
Enjoy hell.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.267
(dramatic music plays)

13:30.351 --> 13:31.977
Captain Stede:
Ah! Ah!

13:32.061 --> 13:34.188
Scoundrels spare no one.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.482
Ah! Ahh!

13:36.815 --> 13:37.024
Ahhh!

13:37.107 --> 13:39.026
â™ª

13:46.116 --> 13:47.868
Hey.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.996
That was
a close call,
wasn't it?

13:51.080 --> 13:53.749
Got yourself pretty
stabbed up there
by some Spaniards.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.044
-My crew!
-Shh!

13:57.127 --> 14:00.798
-(winces)
-Crew's okay. They're fine.

14:00.881 --> 14:03.133
You need to relax.
You gotta take it easy.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.803
Otherwise, your guts will start
poppin' out all over the place.

14:05.886 --> 14:06.887
What?

14:11.016 --> 14:12.184
Do you work for Blackbeard?

14:12.268 --> 14:13.143
Do--

14:18.399 --> 14:20.943
Never thought about it
like that, yeah.

14:21.026 --> 14:21.735
I suppose I do work
for Blackbeard.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.241
Hmm... I'm Ed.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.701
Hey...

14:29.326 --> 14:30.494
Stede.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.247
-(hammering)
-Psst... Hey.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.874
Are you still Jim?

14:35.958 --> 14:38.669
You know, on account
of you being a...
(whispers): a lady now.

14:38.752 --> 14:41.380
Haven't really
thought about it.

14:41.463 --> 14:43.090
Wee John Feeney:
Course she's not Jim.

14:43.173 --> 14:44.717
What kind of a name
is Jim for a lady?

14:44.800 --> 14:46.927
My uncle's name
is Margaret.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.096
Margaret's kind of
an either/or name.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.098
I think Jim's
strictly for dudes.

14:52.975 --> 14:56.937
If you're not going to be
Jim anymore, can I be Jim?

14:58.689 --> 14:59.940
(Captain Stede sighs)

15:00.024 --> 15:02.943
He probably thinks
I'm a fool, that Blackbeard.

15:03.027 --> 15:06.739
-I'm a terrible pirate.
-Oh, come on.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.074
You know,
most of the pirates
I know, they're dead.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.117
So you're doing
a hell of a lot
better than them.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.620
(scoffs)

15:12.703 --> 15:13.954
You're a good man, Ed.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.916
How long have you
been on his crew?

15:18.709 --> 15:22.338
Oh, long enough.
Too long, maybe.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.549
To be honest,
I'm thinking about
packing it all in.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.551
It can be a bit of a grind.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.641
-Is this silk?
-Captain Stede: Oh, no.

15:33.724 --> 15:34.642
That's actually a...

15:34.725 --> 15:36.560
rather exquisite cashmere.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.773
Rather exquisite cashmere.

15:46.236 --> 15:47.154
Oh!

15:50.407 --> 15:51.784
Do you fancy a fine fabric?

15:52.534 --> 15:52.868
I think maybe I do.

15:56.413 --> 15:57.581
Yeah.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.584
Can you keep a secret?

16:01.752 --> 16:02.002
(door creaks)

16:03.837 --> 16:05.214
Fuck off.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.632
I've had a few
secret passages

16:06.715 --> 16:08.258
built into the ship.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.718
You know,
just for fun.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.679
Fucking mental!

16:11.762 --> 16:14.848
This is my auxiliary wardrobe.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.850
It's a back-up
to my actual wardrobe.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.061
-Blackbeard: Okay.
-Winter jackets.

16:21.188 --> 16:21.522
Autumn vibe.

16:21.605 --> 16:24.191
Summer linen.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.195
(exhales)
All of this is yours?

16:29.405 --> 16:31.657
Afraid so.
I'm a bit of a clotheshorse.

16:32.616 --> 16:35.160
Oh, I've been
lookin' for these.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.079
-Fab.
-Izzy: Ed?

16:38.914 --> 16:39.039
Ed?

16:41.458 --> 16:42.543
Edward, you in here?

16:42.626 --> 16:44.712
-We don't have all day!
-(softly): Is that Blackbeard?

16:44.795 --> 16:47.631
Hm? No, uh,
I'm Blackbeard.

16:53.053 --> 16:53.137
Shh.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.435
Wee John Feeney:
We have a serious
question to ask you.

17:00.769 --> 17:02.688
-Are you a mermaid?
-(chuckles) I told you.

17:02.771 --> 17:03.856
(mouth full)
I'm not a mermaid.

17:03.939 --> 17:07.401
-Right, okay.
-No, but the way you said that

17:07.484 --> 17:08.861
-was definitely kinda mermaid-y.
-Roach: Yeah,

17:08.944 --> 17:10.863
-I heard it.
-Frenchie:
That's what I was thinking.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.699
-I'm not a fucking mermaid!
-All right.

17:13.782 --> 17:14.950
Izzy:
Has anyone seen Blackbeard?

17:16.660 --> 17:19.246
-What're you doing?
-Eating.

17:20.581 --> 17:24.168
You don't get food
when you've been invaded.

17:24.251 --> 17:26.837
You live at my pleasure!

17:26.920 --> 17:30.883
Back to work!
Useless fuckin' fuckers!

17:34.511 --> 17:37.681
-(door shuts)
-Alls I know is women
are bad luck on ships.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.099
-(all agree)
-Historically.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.018
-That's a myth.
-Frenchie: Well, no,

17:41.101 --> 17:41.977
actually, science...

17:42.060 --> 17:44.605
because women have
crystals in their body,

17:44.688 --> 17:45.773
and the crystals
attract demons.

17:45.856 --> 17:48.692
And the demons
attract misfortune.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.987
You know,
the French call it--
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

17:52.070 --> 17:53.781
I'm only gonna say this once.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.532
-Once is fine.
-Mm-hm.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.284
-So, listen up.
-Frenchie: Yeah.

17:57.367 --> 18:00.621
I've been on this
ship for weeks now...

18:00.704 --> 18:02.498
and we haven't crashed.

18:02.581 --> 18:05.667
-Hm?
-We were attacked
by the Spanish.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.128
-But--
-Jim: (speaking Spanish)
Look, everyone...

18:08.212 --> 18:08.879
I'm gonna keep
this very simple.

18:08.962 --> 18:12.633
You all know me as Jim, sÃ­ ?

18:12.716 --> 18:15.636
-Frenchie: Yeah, good ol' Jim.
-So just... keep calling me Jim.

18:15.719 --> 18:18.514
Huh, nothing's changed.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.973
Except, I don't
have the beard...

18:21.225 --> 18:23.769
and my, my nose
is different,

18:23.852 --> 18:25.938
and I can speak now, yes.

18:26.855 --> 18:29.107
Anyone got
a problem with that?

18:29.191 --> 18:30.609
-(all muttering "no")
-Frenchie: Certainly not.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.111
It makes sense.
Always liked Jim.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.155
-Yeah, good guy.
You know, he's great.
-Yeah.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.991
(lively harpsichord playing)

18:38.075 --> 18:42.120
-And this is my pride and joy.
-Incredible.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.250
-You've read all of these?
-Many times.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.251
These are just my favorites.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.169
(sighs)

18:49.253 --> 18:51.547
Ooh, here's one
you might appreciate.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.508
Where is it? Oh.

18:54.591 --> 18:55.551
Yeah.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.014
Oh god.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.850
Is this what they
think I look like?

19:02.933 --> 19:07.354
Hm? Fucking viking
vampire clown with--

19:07.437 --> 19:08.856
Look at that.
There's one, two,
three, four...

19:08.939 --> 19:12.359
nine guns all over him.
Nine guns?!

19:12.442 --> 19:15.654
-It's... too many.
-I have-- I, I have
one gun and one knife.

19:15.737 --> 19:19.116
Just like everyone else.

19:19.199 --> 19:21.118
-I didn't mean to upset you.
-No, it's not you. It's...

19:21.201 --> 19:24.663
-(winces)
-It's just fucking hard
sometimes, you know?

19:26.373 --> 19:28.500
You ever feel trapped?

19:28.584 --> 19:30.460
Like you're just treading water?

19:31.545 --> 19:32.671
Waiting to drown?

19:33.463 --> 19:35.173
Yes.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.217
I have...

19:37.301 --> 19:37.843
I very much have
felt that way--

19:37.926 --> 19:40.220
Blackbeard always wins.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.598
That's the thing.
He can't fail.

19:42.681 --> 19:43.807
It's not even
a challenge anymore.

19:43.891 --> 19:47.227
People just see the flag
and they freak out.
"Blackbeard!"

19:47.311 --> 19:49.730
And they basically
just give up.
They surrender.

19:49.813 --> 19:52.441
What's the point?
I don't even need
to be on the boat.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.068
I'm a ghost.

19:55.152 --> 19:55.694
There's no chaos.
There's no drama.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.112
There's no fuckin' life!

20:01.199 --> 20:02.701
Look...

20:02.784 --> 20:03.660
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

20:03.744 --> 20:07.539
but... have you ever
considered retirement?

20:07.623 --> 20:08.540
What the fuck is that?

20:08.624 --> 20:10.250
Oh! Oh...

20:10.334 --> 20:11.710
well, it's when you stop
working by choice

20:11.793 --> 20:14.379
to pursue a life of leisure.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.131
-That's a thing?
-Hmm.

20:16.214 --> 20:17.215
(sighs) Retirement.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.053
You got it all
sussed out, don't you?

20:21.136 --> 20:22.888
You know how hard
it is to find someone

20:22.971 --> 20:25.849
doing something
original out here?

20:26.475 --> 20:27.267
It's impossible, man.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.978
And here you come
with your library,

20:30.062 --> 20:32.189
and your fancy quarters,
and your secret little closet

20:32.272 --> 20:36.318
full of, full of frilly shirts
and, and summer linens.

20:36.401 --> 20:37.903
(exhales) Fuck.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.155
Look it.
There's two chandeliers.

20:40.238 --> 20:41.907
That's overkill.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.951
An open fire
on a wooden vessel

20:44.034 --> 20:47.037
surrounded by
bits of paper.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.997
You're a fuckin' lunatic,
and I like it.

20:49.081 --> 20:49.790
(scoffs)

20:49.873 --> 20:52.334
I know it
all seems great,

20:52.417 --> 20:55.045
but, really,
if I could just...

20:55.128 --> 20:59.841
-be like Blackbeard,
even just for a moment--
-(Blackbeard scoffs)

20:59.925 --> 21:01.927
Honestly, I would give
all of this away.

21:07.557 --> 21:10.352
Hey...
Do you want to do
something weird?

21:12.062 --> 21:14.690
(cheery music playing)

21:16.858 --> 21:18.318
(hammering, sawing)

21:25.701 --> 21:26.326
Crew of "The Revenge,"

21:26.410 --> 21:27.619
please put
your hands together,

21:27.703 --> 21:29.579
and welcome

21:29.663 --> 21:31.331
your brave, brave Captain...

21:31.957 --> 21:33.125
Blackbeard.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.627
â™ª

21:35.711 --> 21:36.420
-Clap.
-(slow applause)

21:36.503 --> 21:37.379
Captain Stede:
Hello, everybody!

21:39.214 --> 21:42.676
Yes, I am
the legendary Blackbeard.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.971
Hello, everyone!

21:46.054 --> 21:48.598
Ooh, ooh, and this
is my new pal, Stede.

21:48.682 --> 21:49.850
Ooh, well,
how do you do?

21:49.933 --> 21:52.686
-What is even
happening right now?
-Blackbeard: I know.

21:52.769 --> 21:54.980
Come on, you lot.

21:55.063 --> 21:57.441
Come on. Come on.
Line up. Line, line up.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.026
-Line up...
-I'm back!

21:59.109 --> 22:00.777
...and greet your Captain.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.654
He escaped
the jaws of death.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.531
(confused muttering)

22:04.614 --> 22:06.992
-Glad you're not dead, Captain.
-Good to see you.

22:07.075 --> 22:08.827
Did you see that?
This is amazing!

22:08.910 --> 22:10.662
A word, Cap'n?

22:10.746 --> 22:13.331
You can be a real
bummer sometimes.
You know that?

22:13.415 --> 22:16.001
When you tasked me
with trackin' that
absolute idiot,

22:16.084 --> 22:17.711
I did that,
no questions asked.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.213
And when we traced him
to a Spanish warship,
I attacked that ship,

22:20.297 --> 22:22.215
losin' several
of our men, by the way.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.384
Mm, kinda the job.
They're pirates.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.386
For years,
I've followed
your every whim,

22:26.470 --> 22:29.473
I've managed
your increasingly
erratic moods,

22:29.556 --> 22:32.225
I've massaged this crew
when they were worried
about your judgment.

22:32.309 --> 22:35.896
-Mm, sounds stressful, Izzy.
-It is,

22:35.979 --> 22:37.189
but I did all that

22:37.272 --> 22:38.982
because I was
honored to work

22:39.066 --> 22:41.026
for the legendary
Blackbeard,

22:41.109 --> 22:44.404
the most brilliant sailor
I had ever met.

22:44.488 --> 22:46.907
But now, you're just
an... insane,

22:46.990 --> 22:49.242
unpleasant shell of a man

22:49.326 --> 22:51.453
who's merely posing
as Blackbeard.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.873
-That's Blackbeard.
-(Captain Stede winces)

22:54.956 --> 22:57.584
I'm Stede, remember?

23:01.630 --> 23:03.423
I'm not dying.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.842
Not for that ponce
and not for you.

23:05.926 --> 23:06.885
So, I'm gonna
devise a plan,

23:06.968 --> 23:09.096
and when we've,
once again,

23:09.179 --> 23:11.264
barely eked by
to fight another day,

23:11.348 --> 23:17.020
I will very willingly
offer you this:

23:17.104 --> 23:22.484
My fuckin' resignation,
you absolute twat!

23:25.862 --> 23:26.613
(grunts)

23:27.114 --> 23:27.948
Oh, it's you.

23:28.031 --> 23:30.283
(grunts and winces)

23:30.367 --> 23:32.786
How quickly can
we move this vessel?

23:32.869 --> 23:34.287
I'm not sure.
That's really
the crew's thing.

23:34.371 --> 23:37.332
-Ah!
-How are you stocked
for munitions?

23:39.543 --> 23:43.088
Ed! Do you know this guy?
He's a complete asshole!

23:43.171 --> 23:45.632
-Ooh!
-Ivan! Fang!

23:45.715 --> 23:48.343
Prepare the guns.
Execute anyone
who won't fight.

23:48.426 --> 23:51.638
-What?
-Well, Blackbeard...

23:52.681 --> 23:54.182
what do you think?

23:54.266 --> 23:55.308
-Do you concur?
-Me?

23:55.392 --> 23:57.769
I mean, you wanted
to be Blackbeard,

23:57.853 --> 23:59.146
this is what it's like.

23:59.229 --> 24:01.106
We could just talk to them.

24:01.189 --> 24:02.941
Okay, yes, and do
you speak Spanish?

24:03.024 --> 24:04.484
-No.
-Mmm.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.987
Maybe they understand
ecclesiastical Latin.

24:07.070 --> 24:12.701
-Twenty, 19, 18, 17, 16...
-Uh-oh, time's almost up.

24:12.784 --> 24:13.869
-What're you gonna do?
-What?!

24:13.952 --> 24:16.329
They're on us now.
Time for a new idea, Stede.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.373
-W-W-We talk.
-The crew's gonna die.

24:18.456 --> 24:20.125
-I don't... have an idea!
-Hurry, you're gonna
lose all your men.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.668
It's all gonna
be your fault.

24:21.751 --> 24:23.420
-Six, five...-
-All of the men
who trusted you.

24:23.503 --> 24:25.046
-I don't know!
-All their blood's
gonna be on your hands.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.506
-It's going to be your fault!
-I don't know!

24:26.590 --> 24:28.508
-Time's up!
-I don't what to do!

24:35.724 --> 24:36.892
Death it is.

24:38.602 --> 24:42.564
-But, wait--
-You're a genius, Blackbeard!

24:42.647 --> 24:43.899
I knew you'd save us.

24:44.941 --> 24:45.942
What?

24:46.026 --> 24:48.028
(ethereal music playing)

24:48.111 --> 24:50.113
â™ª

24:55.285 --> 24:56.786
I don't believe it.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.997
This fog's as thick as stew.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.624
No one'll see
us in this.

25:00.707 --> 25:02.542
Oluwande:
This is why you do not
doubt Captain Blackbeard!

25:02.626 --> 25:06.004
-Genius on the ship!
-(cheers and applause)

25:06.630 --> 25:08.757
-Alright!
-Bravo.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.217
You knew this
would happen?

25:10.300 --> 25:12.761
-How?
-Quite simple, really.

25:13.720 --> 25:14.930
The color of this morning's sky

25:15.013 --> 25:16.014
coupled with the...
brisk westerly wind

25:16.097 --> 25:18.725
made me think we'd be safe.

25:18.808 --> 25:21.061
And then, the shape
of the clouds confirmed it.

25:21.144 --> 25:22.062
-Frankfurters.
-Blackbeard: Yeah.

25:22.145 --> 25:25.607
-Fuck me.
-(laughs)

25:25.690 --> 25:27.984
Izzy, I figured
the fog would set in

25:28.068 --> 25:30.445
once the sea
cooled around dusk.

25:30.528 --> 25:31.988
(all impressed)

25:32.072 --> 25:34.407
'Cept we're right
in their path.

25:34.491 --> 25:36.409
They'll run
smack into us.

25:36.493 --> 25:37.994
Correct!
On any other day.

25:38.078 --> 25:40.664
For it is September 2nd...

25:40.747 --> 25:41.915
and tonight's a full moon.

25:41.998 --> 25:44.125
So lift anchor,
and let the ocean current

25:44.209 --> 25:46.211
drift us into the warm
embrace of safety.

25:46.294 --> 25:48.255
-(cheers and applause)
-Ed, it's--

25:48.338 --> 25:52.050
Ed, Ed, it's
September 1st, boss.

25:52.133 --> 25:54.552
-What's that, mate?
-It's September the 1st.

25:54.636 --> 25:57.430
-Dickfuck, no, it's not.
-He's right. It's the 1st.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.182
The full moon's
tomorrow.

26:08.692 --> 26:11.695
-It's a leap year.
-Captain Stede: Leap year?

26:11.778 --> 26:13.655
Does that change
things much?

26:16.658 --> 26:17.575
Yeah.

26:19.786 --> 26:20.912
We're goners.

26:20.996 --> 26:23.415
(somber music playing)

26:24.624 --> 26:26.459
Those of you who can swim
would be wise to do it now.

26:28.712 --> 26:31.047
-Wait, what are you gonna do?
-I'm sorry.

26:31.131 --> 26:31.631
Where are you going?

26:33.550 --> 26:34.634
The Captain goes
down with the ship.

26:36.845 --> 26:38.138
I'm gonna get pissed.

26:38.221 --> 26:39.889
Blackbeard!

26:39.973 --> 26:42.642
Captain Stede:
Wait... Ed.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.185
I never got
to see the world.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.645
Ah, it's a bit
of a letdown
to be honest, mate.

26:45.729 --> 26:50.233
It's just kind of
rocky and flat,
and rocky and flat.

26:52.068 --> 26:55.822
You know,
I thought I'd have
a cooler death than this.

26:55.905 --> 26:58.658
Something like being
eaten, eaten by a tiger,

26:58.742 --> 27:00.827
or massaged to death
by mermaids,

27:00.910 --> 27:03.538
or... belly-flopping
into a volcano.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.337
(children laughing)

27:10.420 --> 27:11.713
Blackbeard:
What's that painting?

27:13.590 --> 27:15.008
What is it?
A grain tower?

27:15.091 --> 27:18.053
Oh, it's a lighthouse.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.846
I should've been one
for my family.

27:21.765 --> 27:22.807
-And guide them.
-Blackbeard: Hmm.

27:22.891 --> 27:26.686
Well, technically, you're
supposed to avoid lighthouses,

27:26.770 --> 27:28.855
so you don't crack up
on the rocks.

27:30.857 --> 27:33.568
-I never really thought
about it that way.
-Mm, no one does.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.531
Both:
We need to be a lighthouse!

27:38.615 --> 27:40.784
(buoyant music playing)

27:40.867 --> 27:43.119
(quiet chatter)

27:43.203 --> 27:45.955
All right, lads!
I'm here!

27:46.373 --> 27:48.166
(grunting)

27:48.249 --> 27:49.542
All right,
that should do it.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.129
-All right.
-Is this gonna
throw enough light?

27:53.213 --> 27:54.506
Blackbeard:
Should do. Here.

27:55.924 --> 27:56.466
-Take a swig.
-Yeah?

27:56.549 --> 27:58.385
-Don't swallow it.
-Mm.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.763
Okay, would you blow
into those flames there?

28:01.846 --> 28:03.723
-Careful of your face.
-Mm!

28:03.807 --> 28:06.101
Do it, man!
Give it a go now!
Go!

28:07.268 --> 28:08.978
Yeah, that's it.
That's it!

28:09.062 --> 28:11.606
Take another swig.
Give it another go.

28:11.689 --> 28:13.358
In three, two, one, blow!

28:14.776 --> 28:15.985
Oh, yes.

28:16.403 --> 28:18.196
And again!

28:18.279 --> 28:21.741
Keep going.
You there, do it!

28:22.617 --> 28:23.576
Now!

28:25.078 --> 28:27.872
-(imitates foghorn)
-And stop!

28:27.956 --> 28:28.915
(foghorn stops)

28:29.707 --> 28:29.791
(speaking Spanish)

28:33.128 --> 28:35.755
(foghorn sound)

28:39.634 --> 28:39.717
Again!

28:41.302 --> 28:43.847
(imitates foghorn)

28:43.930 --> 28:44.931
(stops)

28:51.938 --> 28:53.148
(flames whoosh)

29:09.164 --> 29:11.249
(cheery music playing)

29:12.667 --> 29:14.169
(quietly):
We did it? We did it!

29:14.252 --> 29:16.588
-(quiet laughter)
-Hey, guys.

29:16.671 --> 29:18.506
-(cheering)
-Fuck, yes!

29:18.590 --> 29:20.592
(shushing)

29:21.759 --> 29:24.387
Yes! We fucking did it!

29:29.684 --> 29:31.478
Looks like we're
gonna live after all.

29:31.561 --> 29:34.397
For a little while longer,
at least.

29:37.567 --> 29:38.443
Do you think...

29:38.526 --> 29:40.862
I can go back
to being mute?

29:44.032 --> 29:45.033
Hey.

29:47.243 --> 29:48.453
Try this.

29:51.539 --> 29:51.706
(Blackbeard sniffs)

29:57.170 --> 30:00.632
Oh... that's some
damn good marmalade.

30:01.424 --> 30:01.674
It's the best.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.678
Ship's stores
are loaded with it.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.096
Had to get rid
of some gunpowder,

30:07.180 --> 30:08.640
but I think it
was the right move.

30:11.434 --> 30:13.520
"The Gentleman Pirate."

30:15.939 --> 30:17.482
I should take a leaf
out of your book.

30:17.565 --> 30:19.901
And then we'll live
the high life.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.320
I could take
one out of yours.

30:22.403 --> 30:23.821
Maybe I'll live
a little longer.

30:26.616 --> 30:27.867
Could be arranged.

30:30.286 --> 30:33.331
If you were
to show me the ways
of an aristocrat...

30:33.414 --> 30:35.041
I could probably
show you a thing or two

30:35.124 --> 30:36.834
about being
a blood-thirsty pirate.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.128
(chuckles)
Wouldn't that
be something?

30:42.257 --> 30:43.299
(chuckles)

30:44.133 --> 30:45.468
(birds cawing)

30:46.719 --> 30:50.557
-You're serious?
-It's the most fun
I've had at sea in ages.

30:55.144 --> 30:56.896
Okay...

30:59.941 --> 31:00.900
Agreed.

31:02.652 --> 31:07.323
-(Blackbeard laughing)
-Whoa.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.201
Okay.

31:10.285 --> 31:11.494
-(clattering)
-Ah...

31:16.624 --> 31:18.585
Oh, I should deal with this.

31:21.296 --> 31:22.964
(ropes creaking)

31:25.174 --> 31:27.385
Izzy?

31:30.805 --> 31:31.764
I said some things
I regret last night.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.853
I don't think you're
a shell of a man...

31:36.936 --> 31:38.313
or a twat.

31:40.898 --> 31:42.317
(Blackbeard sighs)

31:42.400 --> 31:44.777
You were right, man.
About all of it.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.743
-Have you ever heard
of "retirement"?
-Mm.

31:51.826 --> 31:54.621
That's not much of an option
in this line of work.

31:54.704 --> 31:57.540
The only retirement
we get is... death.

32:00.251 --> 32:02.295
What if Blackbeard
turned up dead?

32:02.378 --> 32:04.213
(ominous music playing)

32:05.840 --> 32:08.968
His corpse disfigured
beyond recognition,
of course.

32:09.052 --> 32:10.970
But still be identifiable
as Blackbeard.

32:11.054 --> 32:14.015
Blackbeard:
Well, he's wearing
Blackbeard's clothes,

32:14.098 --> 32:16.142
he's on Blackbeard's ship.

32:16.225 --> 32:20.063
-What happens to you?
-I'm not even here.

32:20.146 --> 32:22.273
My name's Stede Bonnet.

32:22.357 --> 32:25.151
I'm a wealthy landowner.

32:25.234 --> 32:27.612
Of course, the crew
would need a new captain.

32:27.695 --> 32:29.614
Someone who really
knows the ropes.

32:30.406 --> 32:32.575
You mean me.

32:34.744 --> 32:37.372
I suppose it
could be me, yeah.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.584
I need you here.

32:43.628 --> 32:43.878
Edward?

32:46.756 --> 32:48.257
You still got it.

32:51.844 --> 32:53.846
I know.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.015
("The Empty Boat" by
Caetano Veloso playing)

32:56.099 --> 32:58.017
â™ª From the stern to the bow

32:59.769 --> 33:02.647
â™ª Oh, my boat is empty

33:02.730 --> 33:04.649
â™ª Yes, my heart is empty

33:04.732 --> 33:09.362
â™ª From the hole to the how

33:09.445 --> 33:11.489
â™ª

33:22.125 --> 33:26.170
â™ª From the rudder to the sail

33:26.254 --> 33:28.506
â™ª Oh, my boat is empty

33:28.589 --> 33:32.552
â™ª Yes, my hand is empty

33:32.635 --> 33:36.472
â™ª From the wrist to the nail

33:41.811 --> 33:45.565
â™ª From the ocean to the bay

33:45.648 --> 33:49.694
â™ª Oh, the sand is clean

33:49.777 --> 33:52.697
â™ª Oh, my mind is clean

33:52.780 --> 33:57.410
â™ª From the night to the day

33:57.493 --> 33:59.495
