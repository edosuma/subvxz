00:02.875 --> 00:05.000
I hate Mondays.

00:06.583 --> 00:09.875
Rudy comes in all depressed
about how lonely his weekend was.

00:09.959 --> 00:13.500
I know. We either get stony silence
or muffled sobbing.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.583
And I can smell it in the air,
there's a sob a-coming.

00:21.667 --> 00:24.792
Don't worry, guys, Jack and I
are on top of it, to keep him happy...

00:26.083 --> 00:27.250
we bought him this giant cookie.

00:29.375 --> 00:33.333
This weekend he told me he was gonna sit
at home and watch his cat lick himself.

00:35.041 --> 00:36.667
- We're gonna need a bigger cookie.
- Yeah.

00:38.709 --> 00:41.750
I had the greatest weekend of my life.

00:42.458 --> 00:44.542
Yeah, I went on a date
with Bethany Applebaum...

00:45.000 --> 00:46.709
...and it was amazing.

00:47.792 --> 00:50.625
Wait. Our health teacher went out
on a date with you?

00:50.875 --> 00:51.959
Yes, she did.

00:52.375 --> 00:53.667
Why?

00:54.625 --> 00:58.125
Because she has the vision to see
what 1,413 other women didn't.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.041
That I am dateable.

01:02.417 --> 01:04.583
Jack! I was down
at Doctor Kicks Shoe Store

01:04.667 --> 01:06.667
getting these new swag A.B. High-Tops.

01:07.041 --> 01:09.208
You're not gonna believe it.
They're hiring.

01:09.291 --> 01:11.458
Yes! Dude, we gotta get jobs there.

01:11.542 --> 01:12.667
Yo, absolutely.

01:12.750 --> 01:15.500
You get an employee discount
and free odor busters for your feet.

01:16.166 --> 01:18.208
You have got to get this job.

01:20.250 --> 01:23.083
Wait. Why are they called A.B.'s?

01:23.166 --> 01:24.667
A.B. stands for air bags.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.583
They give you maximum bounce
on the basketball court.

01:26.792 --> 01:27.792
Check it.

01:30.250 --> 01:33.291
Yeah, it says not to go past five pumps,
but I'm going up to 20.

01:35.041 --> 01:37.125
Uh, you really think
that's such a good idea?

01:37.542 --> 01:38.834
I think I know what I'm doing, Kim.

01:45.583 --> 01:49.125
That's what I'm talking about.
Maximum bounce, baby!

01:49.208 --> 01:50.959

Yo, check it out.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.375
- Woo!
- Oh!

02:50.250 --> 02:51.375
We gotta get jobs here.

02:51.417 --> 02:54.500
Hey, listen. We always talked
about working here together.

02:54.583 --> 02:57.667
So let's agree they either hire both of us
or neither of us.

02:58.083 --> 03:01.750
Oh, smart.
Hooking yourself to the J-train.

03:03.667 --> 03:06.834
Here at Doctor Kicks,
we believe the customer is always right.

03:06.917 --> 03:09.125
Ah.

03:09.208 --> 03:12.583
Max, we believe that not only
is the customer always right,

03:12.667 --> 03:14.542
but we are always wrong.

03:16.208 --> 03:18.125
Yeah, we don't know a thing.
Am I right, Jack?

03:18.208 --> 03:20.125
- Uh, no, he's--
- Jack, I got this.

03:26.041 --> 03:29.166
Guys, I think I got all I need.
I'll be in touch.

03:31.375 --> 03:33.083
Um, just for the record,

03:33.166 --> 03:35.125
that basketball mini-tramp
is a great idea.

03:35.208 --> 03:36.291
That was my idea.

03:37.667 --> 03:41.375
Might as well bounce those kids right
over to the cash register, am I right?

03:47.291 --> 03:49.083
Jack. I like you.

03:49.834 --> 03:52.041
- Welcome to Doctor Kicks.
- Whoa.

03:52.125 --> 03:53.125
Jerry, I'm afraid--

03:53.208 --> 03:55.875
Thank you, Sir, but if you're hiring me,
you're also hiring Jerry.

03:56.583 --> 03:58.667
You know, in the shoe business
you don't break up a pair.

03:59.166 --> 04:00.875
No matter how defective one of them is.

04:02.792 --> 04:05.875
Jerry, you're in. You guys start tomorrow.

04:05.959 --> 04:07.792
- Yes, thank you so much.
- No way!

04:07.875 --> 04:09.667
- We're in, dude.
- Here's your company whistles.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.500
Oh.

04:11.583 --> 04:13.375
-
- I...

04:13.458 --> 04:15.458
I'd boil that. It was Benny's.

04:15.542 --> 04:17.208
He used to blow it,
but not with his mouth.

04:22.542 --> 04:25.792
And so the lonely peanut passes
through the large intestine,

04:25.875 --> 04:28.417
out the rectum, and into your toilet bowl.

04:30.125 --> 04:32.250
And that my friends, is the scoop...

04:33.000 --> 04:34.291
on poop.

04:36.375 --> 04:38.750
I do not think I'm ever eating again.

04:41.583 --> 04:43.625
Oh, great job. "A."

04:45.917 --> 04:48.750
Ever since Ms. Applebaum
started going out with Rudy,

04:48.834 --> 04:50.500
this class has gotten a lot easier.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.250
Yeah, well, I didn't do my report.

04:54.041 --> 04:56.250
But I think I have another way around it.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.208
Kim, you're up.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.917
See, I was with Rudy...

05:05.959 --> 05:08.583
And I worked on it with Rudy.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.125
And Rudy.

05:15.333 --> 05:16.875
"A" plus.

05:17.917 --> 05:18.959
I need some air.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.875
Petite? Your foot is a catcher's mitt.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.208
Are you gonna show me a shoe
that will fit me or not?

05:37.875 --> 05:41.041
Oh, yes, Ma'am. Just give me a minute
so I can call a blacksmith.

05:43.166 --> 05:45.166
All employees, please meet me
at the slam-poline.

05:45.250 --> 05:47.417
Hustle up, people. Five minutes ago.
Hundred ten percent.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.458
You're late.

05:52.625 --> 05:53.750
Big news, guys.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.583
Our store was just chosen to launch
NBA Superstar Kyrie Irving's new shoe!

05:58.667 --> 06:01.041
- The Air Mini-Flyer.
- No way.

06:01.125 --> 06:04.542
He'll be here in person
on Friday for the launch.

06:04.625 --> 06:05.667
Oh, bring it in.

06:06.125 --> 06:07.083
Okay, back to work!

06:07.959 --> 06:10.417
Dude, Kyrie Irving is coming here.

06:13.291 --> 06:15.750
Jerry, Hey, Jack. Jack,
that guy's taking those sneakers.

06:32.583 --> 06:34.667
All right, let's go inside
and ring you up.

06:35.125 --> 06:37.709
-
- Yeah, man.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.959
-
- Wow, Jack. That was unbelievable.

06:44.417 --> 06:47.792
No, you want to know what's unbelievable?
This woman thanks her foot's a petite.

06:48.000 --> 06:48.834
Oh!

06:52.375 --> 06:53.375
Guys, check it out.

06:53.750 --> 06:58.291
Bethany's status says,
"In a relationship with Pudy pie".

06:59.125 --> 07:00.250
That's me.

07:02.583 --> 07:03.625
Hi, Pudy pie.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.041
Hello, Bethany.

07:11.542 --> 07:12.667
Hey, Ms. Applebaum.

07:12.750 --> 07:15.458
I, uh, I meant to give this to you
after class,

07:15.542 --> 07:16.667
but since you're here.

07:18.291 --> 07:20.458
- Happy Birthday.
-

07:20.542 --> 07:24.959
You remembered it's my birthday.
That is so sweet.

07:25.041 --> 07:26.041
Oh, yeah.

07:27.834 --> 07:29.667
It's just a box for your hair clips.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.458
- Really nothing.
- Oh, but it is something. It's very--

07:32.542 --> 07:33.917
It's pretty close to nothing.

07:35.166 --> 07:37.458
But you're really gonna love
what I got you.

07:37.542 --> 07:39.875
- Now close your eyes.
-

07:41.500 --> 07:44.417
Um, see I shopped and I shopped
and I shopped,

07:44.500 --> 07:46.667
until I found something
that I knew you would love.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.166
See, what I got you was this...

07:52.625 --> 07:56.458
Beautiful, super expensive,
designer Beret.

07:56.959 --> 07:59.000
Oh! I love it!

08:00.959 --> 08:06.291
Hi. I left my really old, super cheap,
non-designer Beret in here the other day.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.500
Did anyone see it?

08:11.667 --> 08:12.625
Is this it?

08:13.333 --> 08:14.417
Yeah, that's it.

08:24.709 --> 08:26.375
I can't believe you lied to me.

08:26.875 --> 08:29.750
Trust is the most important thing
in a relationship.

08:30.792 --> 08:32.750
Maybe you're not the man
that I thought you were.

08:33.458 --> 08:34.625
Good-bye, Rudy.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.291
- Don't you mean Pudy pie?
- Pudy pie is dead!

08:44.917 --> 08:46.417
Why do you think Max called us in here?

08:46.959 --> 08:48.333
I don't know, man.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.417
Maybe he's gonna fire me.

08:50.709 --> 08:52.458
I bet that hoof lady filed a complaint.

08:54.125 --> 08:56.750
Relax. Whatever happens,
remember our pact.

08:56.834 --> 08:58.834
It's either both of us or neither of us.

08:59.333 --> 09:00.208
Thanks, Jack.

09:04.959 --> 09:06.875
Guys. I'm in a tough spot.

09:07.583 --> 09:10.583
I'm promoting one of you, but I'm
gonna have to let one of you go.

09:12.125 --> 09:14.417
Jack, you're fired. Sorry.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.500
What?

09:17.583 --> 09:20.166
Congratulations, Jerry.
You're our new assistant manager.

09:20.917 --> 09:21.959
What?

09:22.291 --> 09:25.250
- But you can't--
- Sorry, but it didn't work out, Jack.

09:26.125 --> 09:28.125
Jerry, isn't there anything
you want to say?

09:29.917 --> 09:30.917
Yeah, there is.

09:32.250 --> 09:35.250
I'm the new assistant manager, baby! Woo!

09:35.333 --> 09:39.166
- Oh!
-

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
What about our agreement
that if one of us gets fired

09:46.083 --> 09:47.333
the other one would leave with him?

09:47.375 --> 09:48.875
Hey, I only agreed to that

09:48.959 --> 09:51.000
because I assumed
I would be the one getting fired.

09:52.667 --> 09:55.917
Whatever, dude. Enjoy your promotion.
You really deserve it.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.375
Jerry, hey.

10:00.959 --> 10:03.083
I want you in charge of security

10:03.166 --> 10:05.166
during the Kyrie Irving visit
to our store.

10:07.125 --> 10:08.000
Me?

10:08.583 --> 10:10.041
- Really?
- Absolutely.

10:10.125 --> 10:12.500
You're the assistant manager now.
I'm gonna need to lean on you.

10:13.542 --> 10:17.291
And also I'm gonna need you to spot me
in 10 minutes when I do my power squats.

Milton.

10:57.291 --> 10:59.125
Rudy said he was gonna try
and win her back

10:59.208 --> 11:01.542
by doing some big romantic gesture.

11:02.125 --> 11:05.542
Maybe he was thinking flowers
or cards or candy.

11:11.458 --> 11:13.291
Woo-ee!

11:14.792 --> 11:16.375
He went a different way.

11:18.750 --> 11:22.000
Listen, Bethany. I know that I messed up.

11:22.083 --> 11:26.000
But to show you how much you mean to me,
I climbed to the top of Mount Seaford,

11:26.083 --> 11:28.000
and carved a heart
with our initials in it.

11:29.333 --> 11:32.792
That's the most thoughtful thing

11:33.375 --> 11:35.375

11:37.500 --> 11:38.417
Wait, what?

11:38.917 --> 11:40.875
Oh, I'm a climber, too.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.542
But you're in the middle of class.

11:43.625 --> 11:45.458
Hey, kids, get out right now!

11:47.792 --> 11:50.542
We just have to go by my place

Yo, Jack.

12:09.625 --> 12:10.458
Look.

12:11.834 --> 12:14.375
When you got fired
and I was hired as assistant manager...

12:15.208 --> 12:16.750
there was something
that I should have done

12:16.834 --> 12:18.333
that I didn't do and I feel bad about it.

12:18.709 --> 12:21.000
Okay, dude. This is more like it.

12:21.083 --> 12:23.500
You've finally honored our agreement
and quit.

12:23.792 --> 12:25.417
Close.

12:26.709 --> 12:29.750
Yeah, I'm here
to get your company whistle.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.333
You're unbelievable, you know that?

12:33.875 --> 12:35.041
Oh, come on, Jack.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.250
For once I got something you didn't.

12:37.709 --> 12:40.166
Dude, that's never happened before.
I'm not used to getting ahead.

12:40.792 --> 12:43.750
Dude, I was in kindergarten so long,
I had to shave for graduation.

12:46.583 --> 12:48.667
Can't you just be happy for me?
I got a promotion.

12:48.750 --> 12:51.792
You didn't deserve the promotion, Jerry.
You're incompetent.

12:51.875 --> 12:55.166
All you did yesterday was bite
the hangnail off some old dude's foot.

12:57.208 --> 12:58.500
Hey, I stepped up.

12:58.709 --> 13:01.125
Okay, that old dude's hangnail
was tearing up our sample socks.

13:12.917 --> 13:16.333
I wanted the Kyrie Irving Air Mini-Flyer
to do three things.

13:16.375 --> 13:19.041
Look good, feel good,
and improve your game.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.041
So what Kyrie Irving is trying to say
is that if you were to buy these shoes,

13:25.125 --> 13:27.125
you will be guaranteed a career
in the NBA.

13:27.208 --> 13:29.417
No, no. That's not at all what I'm saying.

13:31.041 --> 13:34.208
- Who are you, bro?
- I'm assistant manager Martinez.

13:34.542 --> 13:36.625
Yeah, if you need a sandwich,
I'm your guy.

13:36.709 --> 13:40.291
If you need a water, I'm your guy.
Whatever you need, I'm your guy.

13:41.166 --> 13:43.166
- I'll take a water.
- Helen? Get Kyrie a water.

13:46.417 --> 13:47.750
Yeah, Helen's my guy.

13:48.834 --> 13:49.875
I like you, man.

13:50.375 --> 13:52.291
Here, let me give you a pair
of my new shoes.

13:52.375 --> 13:53.959
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.667
No way. Thanks, Kyrie Irving!

13:56.750 --> 13:59.542
Oh, I love that new sneaker smell.

14:01.083 --> 14:04.041
What are you doing?
Would you get your nose out of the shoes?

14:06.041 --> 14:07.083
People are looking.

14:09.667 --> 14:12.208
- Kyrie, the crowd's ready for you.
- Thanks.

14:13.875 --> 14:14.792
Jerry!

14:16.500 --> 14:18.709
In the back, there's a pallet of shoes
that Kyrie autographed.

14:18.792 --> 14:21.500
Signed, they're worth
like 500 bucks a pair.

14:22.375 --> 14:23.750
After you close up, bring them out here

14:23.834 --> 14:25.875
so they're ready to be shipped
first thing in the morning.

14:25.959 --> 14:27.500
Okay. All right.

14:28.291 --> 14:31.291
Helen! Get your nose out of that shoe.
People are looking.

14:32.083 --> 14:33.917
You are this close
to not being my guy anymore.

14:37.792 --> 14:40.291
I don't believe it.
I'm almost there!

14:40.375 --> 14:43.041
I did it! I did it! I did it!

14:48.500 --> 14:52.667
Woo! Oh, that is so exhilarating.

14:54.625 --> 14:55.917
Okay, carry me back down.

14:56.709 --> 14:58.041
No, wait, wait.

14:58.125 --> 14:59.542
Rudy, we came all the way up here

14:59.625 --> 15:01.583
to see our initials intertwined
in a heart.

15:02.458 --> 15:03.875
- So.
- Yeah.

15:04.834 --> 15:06.000
About that. Uh...

15:07.792 --> 15:08.959
- The truth is--
- Hey, Rudy.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.041
What the--

15:11.542 --> 15:14.542
You scared the daylights out of me.
What are you two doing here?

15:15.041 --> 15:17.166
Well, we wanted to see
the beautiful expression

15:17.250 --> 15:19.000
of your love carved into the mountain.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.834
Yeah. A lot of people
want to see that, Kim.

15:23.375 --> 15:24.291
But they're not gonna.

15:24.917 --> 15:26.834
They will if they look right here.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.250
Oh, Rudy.

15:30.542 --> 15:32.667
It's amazing.

15:35.458 --> 15:38.667
Okay, there's a part of me
that thought maybe you lied again.

15:39.166 --> 15:41.750
You just don't really seem like much
of an outdoors man.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.458
What?

15:44.542 --> 15:47.917
Are you kidding? I live for the outdoors.

15:48.583 --> 15:50.709
Well, I shouldn't have doubted you.

15:55.875 --> 15:57.083
Yeah, Bethany.

15:57.709 --> 15:59.333
You should have doubted me.

16:00.792 --> 16:04.166
Because I am a liar!

16:06.792 --> 16:09.583
And I'm also handsome.

16:13.291 --> 16:15.709
That's a very judgmental echo.

16:18.083 --> 16:19.250
The truth is...

16:20.458 --> 16:23.125
I didn't carve those initials. They did.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.834
But I only lied to you
because I like you so much,

16:26.917 --> 16:28.458
and I was scared of losing you.

16:29.166 --> 16:32.417
But I promise I will never ever,
ever lie to you again.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.458
Okay, Rudy. I forgive you.

16:36.583 --> 16:37.458
You know...

16:38.041 --> 16:41.208
I can't believe you actually thought
I was an outdoors man for like a minute.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.792
Well, it's a good thing
that you told me the truth,

16:43.875 --> 16:47.250
because I was gonna suggest that we fly
down the mountain in these wing suits.

16:47.291 --> 16:48.542
I'm sorry, wing-whats?

16:50.542 --> 16:53.250
Yeah. With these suits,
you can jump off the mountain,

16:53.291 --> 16:56.000
and glide down at over 200 miles an hour.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.709
It's a real rush.

16:58.583 --> 17:02.333
Bethany, I like you very much,
but there is no way that I would ever...

17:02.417 --> 17:04.458
- Whoa!
-

17:04.542 --> 17:08.125
-
I'm coming, Rudy!

17:12.417 --> 17:15.458
Wow. He's really flapping
those little wings.

17:16.500 --> 17:19.750

You've got a Kyrie Irving face.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.583
Dude! You're Kyrie Irving!

17:30.291 --> 17:31.917
That what my rookie
of the year award says.

17:33.166 --> 17:35.125
Nobody likes a braggart, Kyrie Irving.

17:36.834 --> 17:38.834
So how was your appearance
over at Doctor Kicks?

17:39.125 --> 17:41.166
Did you meet my "friend,"
the new assistant manager?

17:41.542 --> 17:43.542
Too much aftershave and big ears?

17:43.625 --> 17:45.583
- That's the guy.
- Yeah, I met Jack.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.959
No, his name's Jerry.

17:48.709 --> 17:49.750
That's weird.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.750
I gave him a pair of shoes
and he had me autograph them for Jack.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.125
Man. I didn't see that coming.

17:57.959 --> 17:59.166
I should go talk to him.

18:00.291 --> 18:02.875
Hey, hey. Do you want to see
why I won rookie of the year?

18:03.625 --> 18:04.667
Sure.

18:05.458 --> 18:06.542
You see that cup?

18:13.834 --> 18:16.000
Not today, Kyrie Irving.

18:16.375 --> 18:18.667
This is Tammy's house, rookie!

18:25.667 --> 18:27.417
Hey.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.291
Free Chinese food delivery.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.458
Oh, no, thank you.
I don't like Chinese food.

18:31.750 --> 18:32.750
Well, what do you like?

18:33.583 --> 18:34.625
I like hot dogs.

18:34.709 --> 18:36.417
Free hot dog delivery.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.166
Oh, sweet!

18:39.500 --> 18:42.917
- Come on in.
-

18:43.458 --> 18:44.542
Hey.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.458
Oh, really, Jerry? Really?

18:48.458 --> 18:50.333
All right let's start packing up
those shoes.

18:50.375 --> 18:52.166
- Get over here.
- Oh, man.

18:56.125 --> 18:58.583
Yo, Jack! These guys
are taking the autographed shoes!

18:58.875 --> 19:00.250
Kyrie, untie Jerry.

19:14.166 --> 19:16.458
- Come on, you're free.
-

19:18.166 --> 19:21.959
Woo. Eight and a half extra wide.
I think I may have something in your size.

19:40.291 --> 19:41.834
- Yeah.
- Dude.

19:41.917 --> 19:43.250
Yes.

19:43.291 --> 19:45.166
- Thanks for helping me close up, guys.
- No problem.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.375
No problem, man.

19:46.792 --> 19:48.875
Now, I don't know who this guy is,

19:49.667 --> 19:52.125
but I'm pretty sure
this is our old friend...

19:52.709 --> 19:53.667
Max.

19:55.208 --> 19:56.166
How did you know that?

19:56.250 --> 19:57.917
Well, I was thinking about it
during the fight.

19:58.417 --> 20:00.667
So fired you
because he saw you as a threat.

20:01.208 --> 20:02.625
And he made me assistant manager

20:02.709 --> 20:04.583
so I would take blame
for the missing shoes.

20:07.291 --> 20:09.041
He only promoted me
because he knew I was--

20:09.125 --> 20:10.208
Awesome.

20:11.375 --> 20:13.458
An awesome employee is what you are.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.875
And smart enough
to put the whole thing together.

20:16.291 --> 20:17.291
Max.

20:19.583 --> 20:21.709
- Hey, who called the cops?
- I did.

20:21.917 --> 20:24.542
There were two 14-year-old
kids fighting a bunch of thugs.

20:26.625 --> 20:27.625
How do you guys do this?

20:28.417 --> 20:31.333
- What can I say? We make a great pair.
- Yeah.

20:31.583 --> 20:33.500
Even if one of us is a little defective.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.250
If that's Max,
then who do you think this guy is?

20:39.834 --> 20:40.750
Jerry,

20:42.125 --> 20:45.834
Helen, no.
You were my guy. She was my guy.
