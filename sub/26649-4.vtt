WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:07.900 --> 00:12.333
Let this motherfucking party
begin!

00:13.467 --> 00:16.433
This time we are back
where we belong.

00:16.967 --> 00:19.400
Newcastle!

00:19.467 --> 00:22.900
With our friends.
And family.

00:24.467 --> 00:28.400
Nana!
Doing the things we love.

00:30.767 --> 00:33.700
There'll be some new faces.
Hello!

00:33.767 --> 00:38.100
Plenty of old faces.
Ozzie, Ozzie, Ozzie!

00:38.167 --> 00:41.233
And one big blast from the past.

00:41.300 --> 00:44.800
Long time no fucking see!
(cheering)

00:44.867 --> 00:49.467
But don't worry...
We're still proper radge.

00:49.533 --> 00:54.500
Which means getting inebriated.
You mean mortal?

00:55.467 --> 00:58.600
(retches)
Lots of fornication.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.400
Shaggin', you divvy.

01:01.467 --> 01:02.600
Hello!

01:02.667 --> 01:05.900
And lots and lots of mayhem.
(yells)

01:09.633 --> 01:11.667
Fuck off Now!

01:18.700 --> 01:21.333
Shut your fucking mouth!
(cheering)

01:21.400 --> 01:24.833
Gonna be a pure fucking belter.

01:25.833 --> 01:29.800
I dare you to deepthroat.
I'm not gonna do it.

01:29.867 --> 01:32.667
Girls trip!
(all scream)

01:32.733 --> 01:35.800
Blackpool is a perfect place
for Chloe and Faith to make up.

01:37.833 --> 01:41.567
Usually when you say sorry,
they accept it, not Faith.

01:41.633 --> 01:43.200
Three lads...
One cup.

01:43.267 --> 01:46.600
The boys are asking me
to wear the girls' clothes.

01:46.667 --> 01:48.100
(all laugh)

01:48.167 --> 01:50.833
She's friends with Chloe and
Abbie.
Shut up.

01:50.900 --> 01:54.867
(all yell) The girls' trip
was fun while it lasted.

01:54.933 --> 01:58.333
Last night, Chloe was radge,
in front of Sam, she's holding
back.

02:00.633 --> 02:02.767
Faith is isolating herself.

02:04.867 --> 02:07.367
I hope I can put this all behind
us.

02:10.100 --> 02:12.600
Blackpool has ruined us.
(retches)

02:14.400 --> 02:18.300
I'm totally crackers, me.
I'm preended to perfection.

02:18.367 --> 02:21.367
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

02:21.433 --> 02:24.400
I've got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

02:24.467 --> 02:26.967
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:27.033 --> 02:30.067
I'm happy-go-lucky,
bit of a Jack the lad.

02:30.133 --> 02:32.700
I'm fake, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

02:32.767 --> 02:35.367
What you see is what you get,
bags of fun.

02:35.433 --> 02:38.733
I can't believe anyone would
put me in charge of this lot.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.333
(all) "Geordie Shore", why-aye!

03:00.433 --> 03:01.733
Good morning!

03:01.800 --> 03:04.433
I know Blackpool was supposed
to be a girls' trip,

03:04.500 --> 03:06.367
but I am so happy Sam came.

03:06.433 --> 03:09.833
I love my boyfriend and my
friends.
Why can't I have both?

03:09.900 --> 03:13.133
Did you enjoy last night?
I am happy you came to
Blackpool.

03:13.200 --> 03:18.700
Even though we gatecrashed,
I always knew Chloe would be
happy.

03:18.767 --> 03:21.467
I know that I had a better night
because you were on

03:21.533 --> 03:25.733
because the girls are my friends
but they don't have what you
have.

03:25.800 --> 03:30.167
I love my friends so much but
they
don't have the one thing I need,

03:30.233 --> 03:31.467
a big cock.

03:38.100 --> 03:40.767
(all) Morning.

03:41.467 --> 03:43.033
Oh, my God. It was awful.

03:43.100 --> 03:46.867
We've woke up in Blackpool
and of course, where's Chloe?

03:46.933 --> 03:50.000
The moment Sam arrives,
she disappears.

03:50.067 --> 03:52.567
What the fuck?
What you doing in here?

03:52.633 --> 03:55.500
Did anything happen?
(both) No.

03:55.567 --> 03:57.233
Why is everyone questioning us?

03:57.300 --> 04:00.233
What is wrong with two friends
having a cheeky spoon?

04:00.300 --> 04:03.367
Did you have a good night,
Faith?
I can't remember a thing.

04:03.433 --> 04:06.633
I think I hit it too hard.
You were being sick in a drawer.

04:06.700 --> 04:10.233
Oh, fuck.
I was sick in a drawer?!

04:10.300 --> 04:12.400
On a plus side,
me and Chloe did make up.

04:12.467 --> 04:14.967
The holiday isn't over yet.
What?

04:15.033 --> 04:17.533
There's still
one more thing I've got planned.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.867
Are you joking?
Ballroom dancing!

04:20.933 --> 04:25.233
We're going ballroom dancing?!
Obviously I'm gonna be the best.

04:25.300 --> 04:28.167
You can't be a bad dancer
when you're this sassy.

04:28.233 --> 04:31.433
Youse know what I might do then?
Buy a dress.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.533
Joking.
(shrieks)

04:33.600 --> 04:36.000
What the fuck have I just fell
on?
Ow.

04:47.900 --> 04:49.867
Hello!

04:49.933 --> 04:52.933
We walk in the ballroom,
it's like a princess' castle.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.167
All sexy. I wonder
if they do hiring for weddings.

04:59.600 --> 05:03.333
It's full of old people.
We best on our best behaviour.

05:03.400 --> 05:06.200
We've got some costumes for you.
Boys, there's yours.

05:06.267 --> 05:08.367
We've gotta look the part.

05:08.433 --> 05:12.400
What better way than to do
dancing
in some ballroom gowns?

05:13.667 --> 05:15.500
Hey!

05:16.233 --> 05:19.000
I have definitely pulled
the short straw.

05:19.067 --> 05:21.833
Me dress makes us look
like a fucking bumblebee.

05:23.100 --> 05:26.467
Our left foot over to the right.
Side, close, side.

05:26.533 --> 05:29.400
Together, together.
Cha, cha, cha.

05:29.467 --> 05:33.533
I thought I'd struggle
but Sam is shite.

05:41.200 --> 05:44.667
I'm not gonna lie,
I am really struggling.

05:44.733 --> 05:47.433
If in doubt,
pull out the lobster dance.

05:53.367 --> 05:55.300
(laughs)

05:57.333 --> 05:59.400
Ooh, me tit's fallen out!
(laughs)

05:59.467 --> 06:03.033
Faith's cracking out lobster
moves
and flashing her tits.

06:03.100 --> 06:04.567
Someone call an ambulance

06:04.633 --> 06:07.800
cos I'm worried these
old guys' hearts aren't up to
it.

06:08.967 --> 06:11.800
I've really enjoyed Blackpool,
I'm gutted to go home.

06:11.867 --> 06:14.233
I know, same.
What was the first night like?

06:14.300 --> 06:18.867
It was mad because we said to
Faith,
"You're gonna see the old
Chloe."

06:18.933 --> 06:20.167
She's never seen it.

06:20.233 --> 06:22.733
It was so nice to have
the old Chloe back.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.967
As soon as her lad comes back,
old Chloe somehow disappears.

06:27.033 --> 06:30.867
On the first night,
she was necking wine, five
shots,

06:30.933 --> 06:32.667
all over the floor, dancing mad.

06:32.733 --> 06:34.667
I was Chloe to be like that at
home.

06:34.733 --> 06:38.933
But I want Sam to be
as crazy as he's been.

06:49.567 --> 06:53.467
I love Blackpool. Every
single second has been amazing.

06:53.533 --> 06:56.633
What about Faith?
We made up yesterday.

06:56.700 --> 06:59.233
I like her
but I feel she's still not
herself.

06:59.300 --> 07:03.300
To be fair, Chloe. If you
weren't
busy shagging your lad,

07:03.367 --> 07:07.233
you would have seen
that Faith was fucking
hilarious.

07:07.300 --> 07:10.333
Last night... (gasps)
You shoulda seen her.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.033
She was in the shower naked,
nothing on, right?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.100
Mortal, like being sick on
herself.

07:15.167 --> 07:18.800
She started going...
(blows raspberry)

07:18.867 --> 07:20.833
Then she went, "Ooh."
It slipped out.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.700
Then...
(blows louder raspberry)

07:22.767 --> 07:25.400
Then she went,
"Oops. I can't stop."

07:25.467 --> 07:28.633
Then another one came out,
went...
(blows raspberry)

07:28.700 --> 07:30.967
Fucking hell!

07:31.033 --> 07:35.267
Hearing what happened, Faith is
starting to feel part of the
family.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.600
I was on the floor
holding my stomach.

07:37.667 --> 07:41.567
I went, "Someone make her stop."
(laughs)

07:48.267 --> 07:51.100
(cheering)

07:51.167 --> 07:53.200
(all thank the teachers)

07:53.267 --> 07:56.100
Dancing has been
the perfect end to Blackpool.

07:56.167 --> 07:58.133
This trip has been amazing.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.233
But there's no place like the
Toon.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.633
Back to Newcastle.

08:10.267 --> 08:11.800
Oh, fuck.

08:16.067 --> 08:20.567
Blackpool has been amazing and
me
and Chloe are finally friends.

08:20.633 --> 08:25.267
From now on, I'm gonna avoid
drama
cos I'm here to have fun.

08:36.067 --> 08:39.732
We're back in Newcastle and
Blackpool has taken it out of
us.

08:45.767 --> 08:49.900
I'm fucked.
That's the maddest trip I've
had.

08:49.967 --> 08:53.433
Blackpool has worn us out
but I know just the thing to do.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.467
Get the glam squad in.
It's pamper time.

08:56.533 --> 08:59.567
(all exclaim)

08:59.633 --> 09:02.567
I am buzzing that the
beauticians
have turned up,

09:02.633 --> 09:05.467
it's time for the girls
to relax and have a pamper.

09:16.467 --> 09:18.700
(all) Whoa!

09:18.767 --> 09:22.700
Faith, is that you?
You look like Shrek. No offence.

09:22.767 --> 09:24.133
That actually looks nice.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.767
It's nice to see
Chloe and Faith getting along

09:26.833 --> 09:29.200
now they've had girly time
together.

09:29.967 --> 09:33.200
I want more girls' trips.
You were the best.

09:33.267 --> 09:36.533
We all got so drunk
and didn't remember the next
day.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.600
After a wicked girls' trip,

09:38.667 --> 09:41.567
it's nice to hear Chloe
talking about doing it again.

09:41.633 --> 09:43.800
Hopefully we'll get
more of the old Chloe.

09:43.867 --> 09:47.667
You think you'll carry it on?
Not when I've got a boyfriend.

09:47.733 --> 09:50.100
You've gotta show them respect.

09:50.167 --> 09:52.100
The girls say
they love the old Chloe

09:52.167 --> 09:54.667
but I am
in a very happy relationship,

09:54.733 --> 09:56.400
why can't they love that too?

09:56.467 --> 09:59.500
Do you think you are different
than when you're with?

09:59.567 --> 10:03.600
I'm the same person
but I'll shit in front of you.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.567
We're starting to feel better

10:08.633 --> 10:11.833
so let's get ready for
our first night back in
Newcastle.

10:25.200 --> 10:28.933
Faith, I heard you were very
drunk.
Apparently so.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.533
I wanna see that tonight
cos I didn't get a chance to
see.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.333
I am so glad Faith
let her hair down,

10:35.400 --> 10:37.767
I hope tonight she can do the
same.

10:37.833 --> 10:40.633
I got my shoes on!
Chloe, get ready.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.433
Me and Faith will make a drink.

10:44.033 --> 10:47.200
I look like I've got flippers.
At least you've got long legs.

10:47.267 --> 10:49.600
And I've got heels on.
And I'm 5'8".

10:50.300 --> 10:53.167
Boys, once again,
I'm gonna take it for myself.

10:53.233 --> 10:55.267
Best dressed.
You taking the crown?

10:55.333 --> 10:59.200
The crown was never taken from
me.
Oh!

10:59.267 --> 11:01.967
All jokes aside, we look good.
I can't wait.

11:03.867 --> 11:08.867
Howay, lads! Hurry up!
I don't like your tone.

11:08.933 --> 11:10.567
(cheering)

11:11.467 --> 11:13.633
Who's that sexy cunt?

11:13.700 --> 11:14.967
Wow.

11:15.033 --> 11:17.833
The girls have come down
and they look amazing.

11:17.900 --> 11:21.833
Yuu two look matching.
What about me?

11:21.900 --> 11:24.267
I've got one big stripe.
I'm just plain.

11:24.333 --> 11:26.767
(Sam) Plain Jane.

11:26.833 --> 11:31.133
Sam just called me plain Jane,
what was that about?

11:31.200 --> 11:34.733
Let's just get absolutely
fucked.
Cheers, let's go out!

11:34.800 --> 11:35.867
(all cheer)

11:35.933 --> 11:38.867
I just heard Sam's sly remark
about Chloe,

11:38.933 --> 11:40.767
I'm gonna keep a close eye on
him.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.667
But it's time for us
to head out to the Toon.

11:51.067 --> 11:53.067
Faith's dancing on her own.

11:53.933 --> 11:57.133
Sam's making Chloe feel bad.
I need to go in on him.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.167
I'm actually shocked.

12:02.233 --> 12:03.733
Sam! Stop it!

12:04.267 --> 12:06.133
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

12:08.967 --> 12:09.167
.

12:11.700 --> 12:11.900
.

12:26.033 --> 12:28.633
It's our first night back
in Newcastle

12:28.700 --> 12:31.033
and we've got to the club
and it's bouncing.

12:31.100 --> 12:33.833
But first,
we need to cheers to the night

12:33.900 --> 12:35.700
and celebrate for being wicked.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.067
(all cheer)

12:48.600 --> 12:51.733
Sam calling me Plain Jane
has really knocked me
confidence.

12:51.800 --> 12:56.167
For the sake of the family,
I'll put a brave face on.

13:06.100 --> 13:09.500
Back in the house, it looked
like Sam was being off with
Chloe.

13:09.567 --> 13:11.800
I need to find out what's going
on.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.767
Chloe needs to believe
she is amazing.

13:29.833 --> 13:31.533
She can get anybody she wants.

13:31.600 --> 13:35.533
It just makes us sad that Sam's
made her believe she can't.

13:49.267 --> 13:51.267
Right now, I'm feeling so shit

13:51.333 --> 13:53.867
but I'm happy I've got the girls
to have me back.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.533
It's making us feel better.

14:08.067 --> 14:11.033
I thought after Blackpool,
Faith was one of us

14:11.100 --> 14:14.067
but here she is again,
dancing on her own.

14:14.133 --> 14:16.833
It's like she doesn't want
to be part of the family.

14:21.900 --> 14:24.000
Get me more drinks, I wanna
dance.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.533
Sorry, but I can't let this go.

14:35.600 --> 14:39.533
Sam's making Chloe feel bad
and I need to go in on him.

14:53.733 --> 14:56.867
Is Sophie joking?
Why on Earth has she said that?

14:56.933 --> 14:58.433
I'm actually shocked.

15:12.467 --> 15:14.633
Wow, wow, wow, wow.
What's happened now?

15:14.700 --> 15:18.300
Sophie has come to the toilet
and she looks raging.

15:18.367 --> 15:21.700
I've nearly had a fight with
him.
I'm so angry, I need a shit.

15:21.767 --> 15:25.933
Looks like Sam and Chloe are
having
problems and it needs to stop.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.433
In Australia, you were in a
situation where you could walk
away,

15:29.500 --> 15:32.900
now you've got a house.
(groans)

15:32.967 --> 15:36.667
But she's got a lot going on.

15:38.067 --> 15:41.233
Ow. It's hard for the mirror.
Wash your hands.

15:41.300 --> 15:44.533
Sophie, you haven't washed
your hands after taking a shite.

15:44.600 --> 15:48.133
You've been caught red-handed
or in your case, brown-handed.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.167
You used to have fun with us,

15:50.233 --> 15:52.800
when he's came in,
"I'm not going this."

15:52.867 --> 15:57.100
Me and Sophie have noticed
the old Chloe is disappearing.

15:57.167 --> 15:59.867
We just want you to be you
and back to how you were.

15:59.933 --> 16:03.000
I just need a fucking drink.
Let's get one.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.700
Obviously something's up
with Sam and Chloe,

16:13.767 --> 16:16.367
but I'm just trying
to stay out of the drama.

16:44.567 --> 16:48.400
I'm really upset Sophie said
Chloe
can do better than me.

16:48.467 --> 16:51.667
Now for some reason,
all the girls are slagging me
off.

16:54.833 --> 16:59.300
Adam and Sam are over there
and everyone is giving Sam evils

16:59.367 --> 17:01.633
and I don't understand
what is going on.

17:01.700 --> 17:04.666
I don't want to choose
between friends and my
boyfriend.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.400
Whatever Sophie said to Sam
has made him really angry.

17:18.467 --> 17:20.800
I wish Sophie wouldn't get
involved.

17:25.833 --> 17:28.667
I feel like the girls have been
in Chloe's ear all night

17:28.733 --> 17:31.833
and they're trying
to turn her against me.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.767
What the fuck?! Hurt?!

17:51.700 --> 17:53.333
Is that what this is about?

17:53.400 --> 17:56.467
I didn't realise my crap joke
made Chloe feel like that.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.633
I don't understand
why Sam doesn't get

18:03.700 --> 18:06.033
sometimes he makes us
feel like shit.

18:15.133 --> 18:19.367
Tonight's been a weird one,
let's get back to the fucking
house.

18:25.567 --> 18:29.367
I want to go home.
Not to the shag pad?

18:29.433 --> 18:32.567
With all the girls getting
involved,

18:32.633 --> 18:35.433
the only way we're going to sort
it
is getting away.

18:35.500 --> 18:39.033
It's escalated over nothing.
I wanto go home and sort it out.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.100
We've got back
and Sam has blanked me.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.600
What is he up to?

18:55.667 --> 19:00.533
It's a hard situation but I live
with Sam and I love him so much.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.133
Where is he?
Upstairs.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.733
I'm gonna go away
just to sort things out.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.167
This is really bad.

19:06.233 --> 19:07.733
Sam and Chloe are going home

19:07.800 --> 19:10.000
and we don't know
if they'll come back.

19:10.067 --> 19:12.100
This family is falling apart.

19:12.167 --> 19:15.700
Chloe, you're mad!
Soph.

19:20.100 --> 19:22.333
I don't like how
Sam's been treating Chloe,

19:22.400 --> 19:24.800
but you don't walk away
from the family.

19:30.433 --> 19:33.833
Floor-sweeper, Beetlejuice,
barcode.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.833
Whatever you are,
whoever you are right now...

19:36.900 --> 19:39.533
I'm going to bed.
Can we all sleep together?

19:39.600 --> 19:41.800
Yes.
Tonight's been a disaster.

19:41.867 --> 19:44.433
I think it's best we get to bed.

19:51.033 --> 19:52.700
Anybody want a crisp?

19:59.133 --> 20:02.733
The problem with Sophie, what
we've
got is what she had in the past.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.200
There is nothing worse

20:04.267 --> 20:07.333
than being in between your best
friend and her boyfriend.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.167
(yells)
Say bye-bye to Scotty T

20:10.233 --> 20:11.933
and hello to Scotty Tree.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.733
It's hurting me fanny!

20:13.800 --> 20:16.100
(all) "Geordie Shore", why-aye!

20:18.467 --> 20:18.667
.

20:21.167 --> 20:21.367
.

20:35.833 --> 20:38.567
I think I'm still pissed.

20:38.633 --> 20:41.567
I am hanging
out of my back-fucking-tits.

20:41.633 --> 20:46.133
Last night got really messy.
I remember Sam and Chloe going
home.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.400
What's going on?

20:49.300 --> 20:52.200
Do it.
Stick your fingers in.

20:52.267 --> 20:55.300
Last night I said to Sam
that Chloe can do better than
him

20:55.367 --> 20:56.400
and it kicked off.

20:56.467 --> 20:59.400
I can't believe they left
to go to their own home.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.200
What are we in the same room?

21:01.267 --> 21:03.400
And how are youse
in the same bed again?

21:03.467 --> 21:05.733
He just followed us.
Howay, Abbie.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.400
It was your idea
for us to sleep in the same
room.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.567
If you didn't want it,
shoulda told us.

21:10.633 --> 21:14.800
Can someone make breakfast?
Dibs not me! Go on, Adam.

21:14.867 --> 21:17.733
Make some Coco Pops for us.
This is what I want.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.933
Faith getting involved
in the banter.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.967
Last night
when she was by herself,

21:22.033 --> 21:24.267
I felt she didn't want
to be in the gang.

21:24.333 --> 21:27.467
Really milky, two sugars.
Shut up, you freaks.

21:31.500 --> 21:35.900
What's the difference?
That's an animal, that's not.

21:35.967 --> 21:37.300
Is it not?
No.

21:37.367 --> 21:39.333
What's that then?
A floppy disk.

21:41.767 --> 21:45.400
I think the way that Sam went on
was bang out of order.

21:45.467 --> 21:49.167
Do you think they'll come back?
Fuck knows.

21:49.233 --> 21:52.733
Things got weird last night
but I do hope Chloe comes back.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.400
Sam is not worth leaving for.

21:55.467 --> 21:59.233
Your parents have gone.
You're orphans now.

21:59.300 --> 22:01.867
Seeing they didn't take
their rat children,

22:01.933 --> 22:03.900
I'm guessing they'll be back
soon.

22:03.967 --> 22:08.233
Bye, kids. I do feel a bit bad,
their mum's left them.

22:08.300 --> 22:09.767
She'll be back soon.

22:16.200 --> 22:20.300
Whoo. Last night the girls were
going in on me

22:20.367 --> 22:22.167
trying to turn Chloe against me.

22:22.233 --> 22:24.433
I had to leave
before things got nasty.

22:24.500 --> 22:28.467
Sophie last night... (sighs)
Sophie was very drunk last
night.

22:28.533 --> 22:31.033
Half the things,
she wouldn't have meant.

22:31.100 --> 22:34.100
Thing is with Sophie, she
doesn't
like me and you together

22:34.167 --> 22:36.667
because what we've got,
she had in the past.

22:36.733 --> 22:39.800
That is the honest truth.
She had it with Joel for years.

22:39.867 --> 22:42.667
And she lost that which is a
shame.

22:42.733 --> 22:48.900
I feel like that is the reason
she's
got so much negativity towards
us.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.767
Honestly,
she was just being a friend.

22:51.833 --> 22:55.500
Sam needs to realise, in this
house,
us girls have each other's
backs,

22:55.567 --> 22:57.167
regardless who is with who.

22:57.233 --> 22:59.533
Sophie was just sticking up for
us.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.033
I think where it stemmed from
is,
like,

23:02.100 --> 23:05.667
I was coming down the stairs,
everyone said, "You look
lovely,"

23:05.733 --> 23:07.767
you were the only person who
didn't.

23:07.833 --> 23:10.867
Then you made a comment,
"Plain Jane."

23:10.933 --> 23:13.733
That did tough a nerve,
I can only apologise.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.900
You looked unreal last night.
You look unreal every night.

23:16.967 --> 23:21.100
I'm so happy Sam is apologising
and that he knows he's in the
wrong.

23:21.167 --> 23:23.000
It's put me in an awkward
position

23:23.067 --> 23:27.600
because you're the main person
I care about

23:27.667 --> 23:30.200
but I've known Sophie for years.

23:30.267 --> 23:32.167
I want youse
to try and sort it out.

23:32.233 --> 23:35.933
You and her should have a chat.
Tonight.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.100
I don't think
I've done anything wrong.

23:38.167 --> 23:42.600
But for Chloe,
I am gonna apologise to Sophie.

23:42.667 --> 23:47.100
Go make us some fucking toast.
Take that down as well.

23:47.167 --> 23:48.467
(laughs)

24:01.100 --> 24:03.033
What's this rubbish doing
outside?

24:03.100 --> 24:04.700
Scotty T is back in the ken.

24:04.767 --> 24:07.000
Guess what time it is?
It's time for work.

24:07.067 --> 24:09.767
Hi, Scott.
Oh, fucking hell.

24:09.833 --> 24:12.400
I'm hungover
and the last thing I wanna see

24:12.467 --> 24:15.067
is Scotty T bouncing around
like Tigger.

24:15.133 --> 24:17.600
Where's Sam and Chloe?
They had an argument.

24:17.667 --> 24:21.900
Gone back to their house.
They've had another argument.

24:21.967 --> 24:23.467
That's fucking lovely.

24:23.533 --> 24:27.133
But instead of flicking through
the plastic surgery catalogue,

24:27.200 --> 24:29.367
they need to show me
they can as a team.

24:29.433 --> 24:32.967
Anna wants to know
how well youse work together

24:33.033 --> 24:35.633
so today, everybody's going to
work.

24:35.700 --> 24:39.733
Yay! I don't understand
why the others moan about Scott.

24:39.800 --> 24:43.967
He's always happy, always funny
and always good-looking.

24:44.033 --> 24:49.600
We're doing a Geordie Tours
at a tree-top swingy experience.

24:49.667 --> 24:52.867
Sort yourselves out
and I'll meet you there.

24:52.933 --> 24:55.733
Howay, youse. Come on.
Boss is here.

24:55.800 --> 24:58.467
Let's make a good impression.

24:58.533 --> 25:00.333
Thanks, boss.
Come on.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.867
Get off me.
I'll report you to fucking HR.

25:02.933 --> 25:04.367
I'll see youse there.

25:14.333 --> 25:18.000
Let's go climb some trees!
I can't stop thinking about
Chloe.

25:18.067 --> 25:20.567
Fingers crossed,
work will take my mind off it.

25:20.633 --> 25:22.633
I just hope she's here
when we get back.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.567
Howay.
All right?

25:36.633 --> 25:38.933
Are youse excited?
Fucking buzzing.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.333
We arrive at Geordie Tours
and it looks insane.

25:42.400 --> 25:44.400
Let's go!
Howay then.

25:46.233 --> 25:49.367
I'm not gonna lie,
it's actually really scary.

25:49.433 --> 25:50.533
(screams)

25:50.600 --> 25:52.667
I feel like a kid all over
again.

25:52.733 --> 25:55.667
Climbing in the trees,
playing in treehouses,

25:55.733 --> 25:57.333
this is amazing.

26:02.133 --> 26:05.033
Anna's plan of getting
these clowns to work as a team

26:05.100 --> 26:07.233
is going fucking marvellous.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.900
Chloe and that (indistinct)
didn't even show up

26:09.967 --> 26:12.133
and the rest have had
that much work done,

26:12.200 --> 26:14.333
their joints are
incapable of moving.

26:14.400 --> 26:15.633
It's hurting me fanny!

26:17.467 --> 26:19.067
Whoo!

26:19.133 --> 26:22.000
I can't believe Anna is actually
saying this is work.

26:22.067 --> 26:24.267
Every activity has been decent.

26:24.333 --> 26:25.833
I am buzzing.

26:28.133 --> 26:32.400
These lot need leadership
so I'm gonna have to step in.

26:32.467 --> 26:36.133
Say bye-bye to Scotty T
and hello to Scotty Tree.

26:39.400 --> 26:42.933
(screams)

26:43.000 --> 26:44.367
(yells)

26:46.200 --> 26:49.633
Ooh, you fucker! Fucking hell!

26:49.700 --> 26:53.200
I'm used to landing strips,
but not this sort of landing
strip.

26:53.267 --> 26:54.867
I've landed on me back-eye.

26:54.933 --> 26:57.733
I'm hoping Chloe's there
when we get back.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.367
I don't want her
to stay away for too long.

27:00.433 --> 27:04.000
We're all meant to be here
and it's not the same without
Chloe.

27:04.067 --> 27:07.467
I need to do what it takes
to get her back to this family.

27:07.533 --> 27:09.900
Away from the house,
the worse it's gonna be.

27:09.967 --> 27:12.767
She needs to get back
and we'll look after her.

27:15.600 --> 27:18.100
Gonna tell Anna that we're good?
Maybes.

27:18.167 --> 27:21.033
See you then, Scott.
Nice to see you.

27:21.100 --> 27:25.933
Fuck me, these lots are just as
shit
up the trees as on the ground.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.567
Not everyone can be Scotty T

27:27.633 --> 27:31.533
and the sooner society realises,
the better off people will be.

27:43.167 --> 27:47.633
We've all got back and I was
hoping
Sam and Chloe would be here.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.267
But there's no sign of them.

27:49.967 --> 27:51.533
Are they hiding?

27:52.667 --> 27:55.967
I'm really worried Chloe
never comes back to this house.

27:56.033 --> 27:58.167
I can't take
not knowing any longer.

27:58.233 --> 27:59.800
I need to give her a call.

27:59.867 --> 28:02.400
"Hello?"
Hello, my chicken nug.

28:02.467 --> 28:06.067
Are you feeling better?
"We've got a lot to discuss."

28:06.133 --> 28:11.200
Tonight, I think just the girls
should go for pre-drinks.

28:11.267 --> 28:13.800
We can have a nice girly time
then meet the lads.

28:13.867 --> 28:16.733
"OK, amazing. I'll see you
there."

28:16.800 --> 28:18.067
Bye-bye.

28:19.567 --> 28:23.800
She's gonna come.
Yes, get in! I'm so happy.

28:23.867 --> 28:30.433
I'm glad Chloe's OK, but even
more glad she's gonna be coming
out.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.033
I've got me girl back.

28:35.833 --> 28:37.967
I've been on the phone to Sophie

28:38.033 --> 28:40.600
and I'm gonna go
with the girls for cocktails.

28:40.667 --> 28:42.700
Hopefully I can speak to her now

28:42.767 --> 28:48.333
then before you see her in the
club,
I can know what's going in her
head.

28:48.400 --> 28:51.933
We've got to head back but I'm
glad
Chloe's going to meet the girls.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.967
It's just the boys
when I get back.

28:54.033 --> 28:57.133
Touch wood,
everything will be sound.

29:09.500 --> 29:13.567
I think after last night, it's
only
fair that us girls go for
pre-drinks

29:13.633 --> 29:16.767
and I'm so excited to see Chloe
and make sure everything's OK.

29:22.600 --> 29:25.133
(fart)
I've farted and that stinks.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.733
I can smell it.
That's bad, isn't it?

29:27.800 --> 29:29.100
That's bad for me.

29:29.167 --> 29:32.567
Isn't it weird we've been in the
car
and you've not smelt them

29:32.633 --> 29:35.267
but get in the house and it's
bad?

29:36.467 --> 29:41.367
Hello, hello, hello.
Oh, where youse been?

29:41.433 --> 29:43.000
Nice to have you back.

29:43.067 --> 29:47.467
I'm so glad Sam's back, I just
hope
everything's all right with
Chloe.

29:47.533 --> 29:51.233
What the fuck happened?
I'm not kidding ya, it's Sophie.

29:51.300 --> 29:54.800
Apparently, when Chloe was down
the stairs, someone said "plain"

29:54.867 --> 29:59.033
so I went, "Plain Jane,"
and that's what kicked Sophie
off.a

29:59.100 --> 30:04.367
I was taking to Chloe,
maybe I shouldn't have done
that.

30:04.433 --> 30:06.100
I think she's a beautiful girl.

30:06.167 --> 30:09.167
Where youse both at now?
Couldn't be better.

30:09.233 --> 30:12.833
I don't think Sam should have
called
his girlfriend a plain Jane

30:12.900 --> 30:17.433
cos that's not nice to hear
but I'm just glad they've made
up.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.867
How do you feel about seeing
Sophie?
I was pissed off last night.

30:20.933 --> 30:24.200
I'm gonna apologise as well
because I don't understand now

30:24.267 --> 30:26.000
she is sticking up for her mate.

30:26.067 --> 30:30.033
Sam is gonna be the bigger man
and apologise to Sophie.

30:30.100 --> 30:32.100
I love this boy very much.

30:32.167 --> 30:35.100
Let's stop talking about the
girls
and get ready.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.433
(all welcome Chloe)
Hello, guys.

30:47.500 --> 30:50.333
Is this Barbie?
I've come as Barbie today.

30:50.400 --> 30:51.767
Amazing.
I like it.

30:51.833 --> 30:54.433
But do you not think
it looks like a bra?

30:54.500 --> 30:55.700
It's a bralet.

30:55.767 --> 30:58.100
I love having quality time
with the girls.

30:58.167 --> 30:59.400
It's like Blackpool.

30:59.467 --> 31:02.467
This is to girls' night again.
Girls prinks.

31:02.533 --> 31:03.500
Girls on top.

31:03.567 --> 31:07.500
What a good start to my night,
a nice cocktail.

31:07.567 --> 31:09.900
I feel like you've been gone a
year.
I know.

31:09.967 --> 31:14.167
How many times is this gonna
happen?
I don't think it will again.

31:14.233 --> 31:17.933
He's been licking me arse all
day.
He's realised he's in the wrong.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.200
Chloe and Sam have sorted
the problems out

31:20.267 --> 31:23.233
but me and Sam still need
to clear the air.

31:26.467 --> 31:29.400
From now on,
I'm gonna take a step back

31:29.467 --> 31:33.500
and whenever there's an
argument,
no point me getting involved.

31:33.567 --> 31:36.933
Youse will make up
and I'll look like the bad guy.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.467
There is nothing worse

31:38.533 --> 31:41.833
than being in between your
friend
and her boyfriend

31:41.900 --> 31:43.467
cos you're never gonna win.

31:43.533 --> 31:46.200
Shall we do a girls' cheers?
Yeah.

31:46.267 --> 31:49.433
Cheers to the spoon.
(all) To the spoon.

31:49.500 --> 31:52.967
And pre-drinks and the girls
and vaginas.

31:53.033 --> 31:54.800
So happy I've had this chat.

31:54.867 --> 31:57.167
I just hope Sophie and Sam
finally make up.

31:57.233 --> 31:58.633
Howay then.

32:02.933 --> 32:05.533
I feel like I should be
that kind of drunk

32:05.600 --> 32:07.667
cos I'm shitting meself to see
Sam.

32:07.733 --> 32:09.867
I can feel the tension in the
air.

32:13.567 --> 32:15.433
Tonight has been too much for
me.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.467
Youse are all saying I'm lying.

32:17.533 --> 32:19.867
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

32:21.967 --> 32:22.167
.

32:24.667 --> 32:24.867
.

32:34.233 --> 32:39.733
I think tonight is gonna be
good.
We need to find the fucking
girls.

32:47.000 --> 32:51.300
We've arrived and I'm worried
when
Sam sees Sophie, it'll kick off.

32:51.367 --> 32:53.000
I'm gonna get fucking mortal.

33:11.333 --> 33:15.533
I'm having so much fun, we're
dancing and the drinks are
flowing.

33:15.600 --> 33:20.100
I'm so happy me and Chloe
are friends again.

33:38.700 --> 33:41.667
I'm so happy Chloe is
back with the family

33:41.733 --> 33:45.067
and I love girls' night
cos on every girls' night,

33:45.133 --> 33:46.467
we get the old Chloe back.

34:03.767 --> 34:06.167
I feel like I should be
that kind of drunk

34:06.233 --> 34:08.667
cos I'm shitting meself to see
Sam.

34:19.667 --> 34:23.100
We've got to the club
and the girls are fucked.

34:23.167 --> 34:25.699
I just wish we'd gone out
earlier.

34:25.766 --> 34:27.967
It's time to play fucking catch
up.

34:34.433 --> 34:37.699
Don't get me wrong, I'm so glad
to be back out with the family

34:37.766 --> 34:40.132
but me and Sophie
have still not spoken

34:40.199 --> 34:43.199
and I can feel the tension
in the air.

34:51.533 --> 34:54.400
I need to find out what the
girls
were talking about

34:54.467 --> 34:56.632
and if Sophie is ready
to talk to Sam.

34:56.699 --> 35:00.033
Back in the old days, I'd have
been
the first person Chloe told.

35:17.900 --> 35:20.633
I am a grown adult
and adults sort things out.

35:20.700 --> 35:22.600
I've said what I've had to say

35:22.667 --> 35:27.200
but I know that tonight, I've
got
to sort it out for Chloe's sake.

35:55.633 --> 35:58.433
Sam's a proper lad,
he doesn't talk about feelings

35:58.500 --> 36:00.000
but he needs to open up more.

36:30.267 --> 36:33.633
When Faith first walked in,
I thought she'd fit in

36:33.700 --> 36:36.600
but now she's distancing
herself,
I'm not sure.

36:44.467 --> 36:48.767
I'm mortal and I'm finding it
hard
to explain meself.

36:48.833 --> 36:50.900
Why can't Nathan
cut us a bit of slack?

36:57.500 --> 37:01.767
Faith is a nice girl and I know
this is new and scary for her,

37:01.833 --> 37:05.667
sometimes when she goes off,
I feel like she doesn't like us

37:05.733 --> 37:07.133
and it's annoying me.

37:18.533 --> 37:21.500
I can't understand
why Nathan is so angry.

37:21.567 --> 37:25.000
All I want is to fit in
but I really don't know how.

37:36.367 --> 37:38.800
Nathan thinks
that Faith dancing on her own

37:38.867 --> 37:41.833
means she doesn't like us,
but maybe we need to try harder

37:41.900 --> 37:43.933
and make her feel
part of the family.

37:45.900 --> 37:49.567
Tonight has gone well weird
and we need to get the fuck
home.

37:51.567 --> 37:53.200
It's come to the end of the
night

37:53.267 --> 37:55.400
and Sophie and Sam
still haven't spoken.

37:55.467 --> 37:57.667
I just hope when we get home,
they speak.

38:12.367 --> 38:13.867
I'm recycling!

38:14.767 --> 38:17.500
I'm really drunk,
confused and upset.

38:17.567 --> 38:20.567
I don't want to talk to anyone,
I just wanna be alone.

38:21.967 --> 38:27.533
I'm a kebab lady.
I'm a kebab lady!

38:27.600 --> 38:30.700
Tonight we have got
the old Chloe back.

38:30.767 --> 38:33.400
I mean, look at her.
She's got kebab all over her.

38:33.467 --> 38:35.833
I'm a kebab!
(coughs)

38:35.900 --> 38:37.833
You two are matching.

38:39.167 --> 38:41.667
I can't stand
the awkwardness any more.

38:41.733 --> 38:44.367
I need to talk to Sam away
from everyone.

38:44.433 --> 38:46.933
After last night,
so many things got said

38:47.000 --> 38:49.233
I want to apologise to you.

38:49.300 --> 38:54.533
I appreciate Sam's apology, it
takes
a man to own up to his actions.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.733
I'm sorry for what I said
cos I do't want to upset anyone.

38:57.800 --> 39:01.833
We've both said sorry,
that's it nipped in the bud.

39:01.900 --> 39:04.200
I want to be mates
cos it's Chloe's best mate.

39:04.267 --> 39:07.133
God fucking help youse
when I get in a relationship.

39:07.200 --> 39:12.300
You fucking dare have an
opinion.
(laughs)

39:12.367 --> 39:15.000
Don't you dare have an opinion.

39:15.067 --> 39:18.100
You eat that burger,
I'm going for a drink.

39:23.600 --> 39:26.567
The old Chloe's back,
Sophie and Sam have made up

39:26.633 --> 39:28.467
but I best go check on Faith.

39:28.533 --> 39:31.367
You need to stop letting things
get on top of you

39:31.433 --> 39:36.567
because you can do this,
you're a strong girl.

39:36.633 --> 39:39.400
I really appreciate Abbie
trying to comfort us.

39:39.467 --> 39:43.067
Maybe she remembers
what it's like to be the new
girl.

39:43.133 --> 39:44.800
Give us a hug.

39:46.467 --> 39:47.333
All right?

39:50.933 --> 39:53.433
Stop being a dickhead.
Eat your food properly.

39:53.500 --> 39:56.833
Get a knife and fork,
you're a civilised human being.

39:56.900 --> 39:58.533
(garbles)

39:58.600 --> 40:01.567
Chloe Ferry is back in the
building.

40:01.633 --> 40:04.067
I don't know what the fuck
you just said to me.

40:04.133 --> 40:05.700
(garbles)

40:05.767 --> 40:06.867
(coughs)

40:09.767 --> 40:11.400
Faith is new to the house

40:11.467 --> 40:15.600
but I want her to realise even
though we have our
disagreements,

40:15.667 --> 40:18.200
we are still
one big fucked-up family.

40:18.267 --> 40:19.500
Drop the act.

40:19.567 --> 40:23.167
When I'm being meself,
youse are all saying I'm lying!

40:23.233 --> 40:25.300
Youse all are saying
I'm bullshitting!

40:25.367 --> 40:27.633
Youse given me the chance
to change my mind!

40:27.700 --> 40:31.633
I literally don't know what more
I can do to try to fit in.

40:31.700 --> 40:33.900
Everything I do seems to be
wrong.

40:33.967 --> 40:37.400
You're not integrating with us.
Not one person danced with us.

40:37.467 --> 40:39.700
I spent three hours
dancing by myself.

40:39.767 --> 40:43.800
That's what I do.
We dance with you then you walk
off.

40:43.867 --> 40:47.033
I don't remember that.
The second you enter this door,

40:47.100 --> 40:50.667
the second you come in here,
we care for each other.

40:50.733 --> 40:54.567
We have each other's backs,
and I want you to be part of
that.

40:54.633 --> 40:56.967
I want this girl
to be part of the family,

40:57.033 --> 40:59.233
I want her to be
like my little sister.

40:59.300 --> 41:01.733
I seen the real you
when you were outside,

41:01.800 --> 41:03.467
you told me about the prying.

41:03.533 --> 41:07.300
And I seen the real you when you
got
carried out the shower and
farted.

41:07.367 --> 41:10.067
That's you and that's
what I want to see more of.

41:10.133 --> 41:12.300
I'm fucked.

41:12.367 --> 41:15.767
Me and Nathan are the only two
people that really remembers

41:15.833 --> 41:18.133
how difficult it is to fit in
here.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.600
So from now on,
we need to look after Faith.

41:20.667 --> 41:25.233
Look at all of us, man.
We're fucked up, all of us are.

41:25.300 --> 41:28.900
Get yourself up to bed.
Go on, take her upstairs.

41:28.967 --> 41:33.600
Tonight has been too much for
me,
emotions all over.

41:33.667 --> 41:34.667
Get me to bed.

41:45.533 --> 41:49.167
(screams)
Ah, you fucker!

41:49.233 --> 41:52.000
Me and Chloe are doing
what we do best, pissing about.

41:55.100 --> 41:56.667
Me and Sophie have chatted.

41:56.733 --> 42:01.600
I said, "Sophie, I'm sorry
if I offended you."

42:01.667 --> 42:03.867
Now me and Sophie are best
mates.

42:03.933 --> 42:05.800
Even though I'm so pissed,

42:05.867 --> 42:10.600
I am overwhelmed that Sophie and
Sam
have finally made up.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.733
No, no!

42:19.800 --> 42:22.600
I am in no state
to be walking down any stairs.

42:22.667 --> 42:24.233
Where's the ironing board?

42:26.500 --> 42:29.400
(screams)

42:31.400 --> 42:34.667
Tonight has been eventful,
time for bed.

42:37.467 --> 42:41.600
I can see Adam is making his way
over but I want to sleep alone.

42:46.333 --> 42:50.067
Looks like this chat about us
is getting to her and she's pied
us.

42:50.133 --> 42:53.167
I need to cool things off
before I get hurt.

43:01.700 --> 43:04.667
Let's make a pact
to make Faith feel more welcome.

43:04.733 --> 43:08.233
There's nothing like a dance off
to bring the family together.

43:08.300 --> 43:10.800
I popped the bean bag!
Christmas!

43:10.867 --> 43:13.500
These beans get everywhere.
(farts)

43:13.567 --> 43:16.467
Party crew! We're taking
a big fucking tank out.

43:16.533 --> 43:17.667
Scotty T in tanks.

43:21.533 --> 43:24.933
If he ever calls me jealous
again,
I'll have something to say.

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
Adam, I'm telling you how I
feel.
You laughed in my face.

43:30.067 --> 43:32.167
And you're laughing again!

44:01.867 --> 44:02.067
.
