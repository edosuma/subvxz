00:05.588 --> 00:08.048
Dr. Johnson, you have a call on line 7.

00:08.216 --> 00:11.385
She's not here yet.
She's having my baby and she's not here.

00:11.553 --> 00:14.471
- Everything's fine. Has her water broken?
- I don't know.

00:14.639 --> 00:17.766
But when I spoke to her, she said
she'd already passed the mucus plug.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.272
Do we have to know about that?

00:23.857 --> 00:25.816
What are you gonna do
when you have a baby?

00:25.984 --> 00:29.737
I'm gonna be in the waiting room,
handing out cigars.

00:29.946 --> 00:33.866
Yes, Joey's made arrangements
to have his baby in a movie from the '50s.

00:35.452 --> 00:39.121
Aah, I don't believe this. I mean,
she could be giving birth in the cab.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.414
Oh, Ross, relax.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.750
It's only like $2 for the first contraction...

00:42.917 --> 00:46.086
...and then 50 cents
each additional contraction.

00:47.672 --> 00:49.673
What, it's okay when Chandler does it?

00:50.884 --> 00:52.676
You have to pick your moments.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.555
- Hi. Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
- No, she's not even here yet.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.515
- Oh.
- What's with the guitar?

00:58.683 --> 01:02.561
I just thought we might be here for a while,
so, you know, things might get musical.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.732
- Hey, where the hell have you been?
- We stopped at the gift shop.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.651
I was looking at stuffed animals,
and Susan wanted a Chunky.

01:09.819 --> 01:13.697
Susan wanted a... You're having a baby.
A baby. You don't stop for Chunkys.

01:13.865 --> 01:16.617
- I used to have that bumper sticker.
- Ha, ha.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.494
You see what I mean?

02:06.376 --> 02:09.794
- "Stopped for a Chunky."
- Let it go, Ross.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.005
I got an extra one. You want this?

02:12.882 --> 02:14.466
No.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.011
Hey, how's my favorite
parenting team doing?

02:18.179 --> 02:19.805
Dr. Franzblau. Hi.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.933
So I understand you're thinking
of having a baby.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.309
Wow.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.062
I see you're nine months pregnant.
That's a good start.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.649
- How you doing with your contractions?
- Oh, I love them.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.360
Each one's like a little party in my uterus.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.572
Ha, ha. They're every four minutes
and last 55 seconds.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.824
Fifty-nine seconds. Quartz. Ha.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.368
Swiss quartz. Ha, ha.

02:43.371 --> 02:46.123
- Am I allowed to drink anything?
- Ice chips, just ice chips.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.458
- They're at the nurses' station.
- I'll get them.

02:48.626 --> 02:51.795
- No, I'm getting it. Be right back.
- No, I got it. I'm getting it.

02:53.256 --> 02:56.675
Hi. Thought you might like
some ice chips.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.218
Thanks.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.554
And if you need anything else, I...

03:00.722 --> 03:02.639
...do not believe we have met. Hi.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.642
I'm Rachel Green.

03:05.810 --> 03:09.104
I'm Carol's ex-husband's
sister's roommate. Ha, ha.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.024
It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.652
I'm your roommate's brother's
ex-wife's obstetrician.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.656
Oh, that's funny.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.456
I want a baby.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.751
Hmm. Not tonight, honey.
I got an early day tomorrow.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.503
Get up. Come on, let's get some coffee.

03:33.755 --> 03:37.049
Oh, okay, because we never do that.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.927
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

03:40.094 --> 03:42.137
Or just fall down. That's good too.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.306
- Knick fan?
- Oh, yeah.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.643
- Oh, boy, do they suck.
- Hey, listen, lady, I...

03:47.852 --> 03:49.144
Whoa.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.440
Look. Look at your man Ewing.
Nice shot.

03:53.608 --> 03:56.443
You know, he couldn't hit water
if he was standing on a boat.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.111
Oh, yeah? And who do you like?

03:58.279 --> 04:00.530
- Celtics.
- Celtics? Ha!

04:00.698 --> 04:03.617
They couldn't hit a boat if... Wait.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.537
They suck, all right?

04:08.081 --> 04:10.374
Shut up.
You know, it's a rebuilding year. You...

04:10.541 --> 04:11.875
- Aah! Aah!
- Oh. Aah.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.543
Uh, let me get the father. Hey!

04:13.711 --> 04:16.004
We need a father over here!
We need a father!

04:16.172 --> 04:17.505
There's no father.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.423
Oh. Oh.

04:19.591 --> 04:20.676
Oh, sorry.

04:20.885 --> 04:23.553
Oh, that's okay. I'm fine. I'm...

04:23.721 --> 04:25.430
- Oh!
- Oh, uh...

04:25.598 --> 04:27.099
Okay. All right. Uh, right this way.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.768
All the other pregnant women
seem to be going in here.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.228
Okay.

04:37.360 --> 04:41.196
They're tiny and chubby
And so sweet to touch

04:41.364 --> 04:45.033
But soon they'll grow up
And resent you so much

04:47.412 --> 04:51.039
Now they're yelling at you
And you don't know why

04:51.207 --> 04:58.505
And you cry and you cry and you cry

04:58.673 --> 05:00.841
- Thanks, Ross.
- Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.176
Okay.

05:04.470 --> 05:08.432
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.

05:09.475 --> 05:13.520
No fair. I don't even have one.
How come they get two?

05:13.688 --> 05:16.481
- You'll get one.
- Oh, yeah? When?

05:16.733 --> 05:18.025
I'll tell you what.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.569
When we're 40,
if neither of us are married...

05:21.404 --> 05:23.613
...what do you say you and I have one?

05:23.781 --> 05:25.574
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?

05:26.784 --> 05:28.952
Oh, no, no, no.
I just meant hypothetically.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.122
Okay, hypothetically,
why won't I be married when I'm 40?

05:32.332 --> 05:34.541
- No, no, no.
- No, no, what is it? Seriously.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.210
Is there something
fundamentally unmarriable about me?

05:38.129 --> 05:40.630
- Uh... Uh...
- Well?

05:40.798 --> 05:44.343
Dear God. This parachute is a knapsack.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.513
- Hey.
- Hey. Ooh.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.682
- Look at you, dressy-dress.
- Yeah.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.726
Did you go home and change?

05:52.894 --> 05:56.229
Yeah, well, it's an important day.
I wanna look nice.

05:56.397 --> 05:59.066
Um, has Dr. Franzblau been by?

06:00.651 --> 06:01.818
No, I haven't seen him.

06:01.986 --> 06:04.988
Well, where is he?
He is supposed to be here.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.159
What if the baby needs him?

06:09.327 --> 06:11.453
Rachel, what is the deal
with you and doctors?

06:11.662 --> 06:15.624
- Is, like, your father a doctor?
- Yeah. Why?

06:16.376 --> 06:17.834
No reason.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.963
Mom, we've been through this.

06:22.131 --> 06:24.758
No, I am not calling him.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.886
I don't care if it is his kid.
The guy's a jerk.

06:28.054 --> 06:31.973
No, I am not alone. Joey's here.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.643
What do you mean, "Joey who?"

06:34.811 --> 06:36.103
Joey who?

06:36.270 --> 06:39.606
- Tribbiani.
- Joey Tribbiani.

06:40.274 --> 06:44.528
Yes. Okay. Hold on.

06:44.695 --> 06:47.072
- She wants to talk to you.
- No.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.032
Take the phone.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.951
Hi. Yeah, it's me.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.997
Oh, no, no, no. We're just friends. Yeah.

06:56.165 --> 06:58.125
Yeah, I'm single.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.335
Twenty-five.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.753
An actor.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.505
Hello?

07:08.261 --> 07:10.804
- She's not much of a phone person.
- Yeah.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.808
So, uh, what's the deal
with this father guy?

07:14.976 --> 07:18.854
I mean, if someone was having my baby
somewhere, I'd wanna know about it.

07:19.021 --> 07:23.233
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested
in your views on fatherhood? Um, no.

07:25.611 --> 07:28.321
Okay. Uh, look, maybe I should just go.

07:28.489 --> 07:31.199
- Maybe you should.
- Good luck.

07:31.367 --> 07:34.703
And, uh, take care, huh?

07:41.210 --> 07:44.379
Know what the Celtics' problem is?
They let the players run the team.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.755
Oh, that is so not true.

07:45.923 --> 07:47.716
- Oh, it is. It is.
- It isn't. Isn't.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.427
- Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
- Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.512
You're gonna kill me!

07:52.680 --> 07:56.475
- Fifteen more seconds. Fourteen, 13, 12...
- Count faster.

07:56.642 --> 07:59.811
It's gonna be okay. We're doing it for Jordy.
Keep focusing on Jordy.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.104
Who the hell is Jordy?

08:02.023 --> 08:03.398
- Your son.
- Whoa, whoa whoa.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.858
I don't have a son named Jordy.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.152
We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.113
Well, Jamie was the name
of Susan's first girlfriend...

08:10.281 --> 08:12.574
...so we went back to Jordy.

08:12.950 --> 08:13.992
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.703
What do you mean, "back to Jordy"?
We never landed on Jordy.

08:16.871 --> 08:22.125
We just passed by it
during the whole Jesse/Cody/Dillon fiasco.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.376
Ow, ow, ow!

08:23.544 --> 08:25.212
- What? What? What?
- Leg cramp, leg cramp.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.422
- I got it. I got it.
- I got it. I'm doing it.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.008
You get to sleep with her.
I get the cramps.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.343
No, you don't.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.803
- That is it. I want both of you out.
- What?

08:33.971 --> 08:35.429
- She started it.
- He started it.

08:35.597 --> 08:36.640
I don't care.

08:36.807 --> 08:39.058
I'm trying to get a person
out of my body here...

08:39.227 --> 08:42.687
...and you're not making it any easier.
Now go!

08:45.107 --> 08:46.608
- Thanks a lot.
- See what you did?

08:46.776 --> 08:49.152
- Yeah. Listen...
- Out.

08:51.322 --> 08:55.742
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.702
Oh, no.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.080
Ew.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.667
What is that? Something exploded.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.169
It's just her water breaking.
Calm down, will you?

09:06.337 --> 09:09.714
Water breaking? What do you mean?
What's that, water breaking?

09:09.882 --> 09:13.510
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

09:14.804 --> 09:18.557
- Oh, please. This is so your fault.
- How? How is this my fault?

09:18.724 --> 09:21.685
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room
before you came along.

09:21.894 --> 09:25.480
Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did
before I came along.

09:26.107 --> 09:29.568
- Are you trying to be clever?
- You are so threatened by me.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.779
- Everything I say is a problem.
- Hey, hey, hey. Okay. All right.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.447
That's it. Get in here. Come on.

09:34.615 --> 09:38.410
My God, you guys. I don't believe you.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.746
There are children coming into the world
in this very building...

09:41.914 --> 09:45.458
...and your fighting noises are not
the first thing they should be hearing.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.086
So just stop all the yelling! Just stop it!

09:48.296 --> 09:50.714
Yeah, Susan.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.593
Don't make me do this again!
I don't like my voice like this!

09:59.807 --> 10:02.225
Okay, who wants to hear
something ironic?

10:07.523 --> 10:08.565
Help!

10:08.733 --> 10:10.108
- Come on!
- Help!

10:10.276 --> 10:12.902
- I'm having a baby in there!
- Hello?

10:13.070 --> 10:15.238
- Help!
- Okay, everyone stand back.

10:19.702 --> 10:20.785
Ow.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.332
Are they here yet?

10:25.499 --> 10:27.917
No, honey, but don't worry,
we're gonna find them.

10:28.085 --> 10:31.254
And until we do,
we are all here for you, okay?

10:31.422 --> 10:32.839
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

10:33.007 --> 10:36.509
Anyway, you were telling me about Paris.
It sounds wonderful.

10:36.677 --> 10:40.138
It really was. There was this
great little pastry shop right by my hotel...

10:41.557 --> 10:44.601
There you go, dear. You...

10:44.769 --> 10:46.770
Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push.

10:46.979 --> 10:50.148
Push him out, push him out.
Harder, harder.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.609
Push him out, push him out. Way out.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.612
Let's get that ball and really move.
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.

10:55.780 --> 10:56.863
Let's get...

10:59.033 --> 11:01.242
I was just... Yeah, okay.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.703
Push, push, push.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.416
What are you gonna do,
suck the door open?

11:10.920 --> 11:14.381
- Help! Help! Help!
- Help!

11:14.548 --> 11:18.677
And they found their bodies
The very next day

11:18.844 --> 11:22.764
And they found their bodies
The very next...

11:23.891 --> 11:25.517
La, la, la, la, la, la

11:25.685 --> 11:27.477
Help!

11:27.687 --> 11:32.190
No, Mom, everything's going fine, really.
Yeah, Ross is great. He's, uh...

11:32.400 --> 11:36.945
He's in a whole other place. Yeah.
No, he's gone.

11:37.113 --> 11:40.281
No, no, you don't have to fly back.
Really.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.575
What do you mean,
this might be your only chance?

11:42.743 --> 11:45.120
Oh. Would you stop? I'm only 26.

11:45.287 --> 11:47.122
I'm not even thinking about babies yet.

12:01.220 --> 12:04.347
- Where have you been?
- Oh, I just had a baby.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.684
Mazel tov.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.982
I don't know.
It could be an hour, it could be three.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.109
But relax, she's doing great.

12:16.277 --> 12:20.864
So, uh, tell me,
are you currently involved with anyone?

12:21.073 --> 12:24.075
No. No, not at...
At the moment, no, I'm not, no.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.035
- Are you?
- No, no.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.079
It's hard enough to get women
to go out with me.

12:28.247 --> 12:32.167
Heh. Right, yeah,
I've heard that about cute doctors.

12:32.835 --> 12:33.877
No, no, really.

12:34.044 --> 12:38.548
I suppose it's because
I spend so much time, you know...

12:39.091 --> 12:40.341
...where I do.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.012
- Oh.
- Mm.

12:44.180 --> 12:48.892
I try not to let work affect my personal life,
but it's hard when you do...

12:49.059 --> 12:51.770
...what I do. It's like, uh...

12:51.937 --> 12:54.189
Well, for instance, what do you do?

12:54.356 --> 12:56.983
- I'm a waitress.
- Okay, all right.

12:57.151 --> 13:00.320
Well, aren't there times when you come
home at the end of the day...

13:00.488 --> 13:04.949
...and you're just like,
"If I see one more cup of coffee..."

13:09.622 --> 13:11.831
Ahem. Yeah. Gotcha.

13:13.042 --> 13:17.754
- I'm gonna check up on your friend.
- Okay, that's fine.

13:25.888 --> 13:29.390
- So how did you know I was even here?
- Your mom called me.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.726
So is this her?

13:31.894 --> 13:33.645
No, this is a loaner.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.899
Listen, I'm sorry you had to do this
by yourself.

13:38.067 --> 13:43.988
Oh. I wasn't by myself.
I had a doctor, a nurse and a helper guy.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.242
So did you see who won the game?

13:47.409 --> 13:50.954
Yeah, Knicks by 10. They suck.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.915
Eh, they're not so bad.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.730
Come on. Come on.

14:20.234 --> 14:24.070
Damn it, damn it, damn it.
This is all your fault.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.948
This is supposed to be, like,
the greatest day of my life.

14:27.116 --> 14:30.076
My son is being born,
and I should be in there, you know?

14:30.244 --> 14:32.161
Instead I'm stuck in a closet with you.

14:32.329 --> 14:35.665
I've been waiting for this
just as much as you have.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.002
Believe me, no one has been waiting
for this as much as I have, okay?

14:39.169 --> 14:40.879
And you know what the funny thing is?

14:41.046 --> 14:43.631
When this day is over,
you get to go home with the baby.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.217
- Where does that leave me?
- You get to be the father.

14:46.385 --> 14:50.138
Everyone knows who you are. Who am I?
There's Father's Day. There's Mother's Day.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.599
There's no Lesbian Lover Day.

14:52.766 --> 14:55.226
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.814
This is so great.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.570
You wanna explain that?

15:06.280 --> 15:09.532
I mean, well, because when I was
growing up, you know, my dad left...

15:09.700 --> 15:12.744
...and my mother died,
and my stepfather went to jail.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.664
So I barely had enough pieces of parents
to make one whole one.

15:17.791 --> 15:21.336
And here's this little baby
who has like three whole parents...

15:21.503 --> 15:25.256
...who care about it so much that they fight
over who gets to love it the most...

15:25.424 --> 15:27.842
...and it's not even born yet.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.553
It's just the luckiest baby
in the whole world.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.433
I'm sorry. You were fighting.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.020
Where are they?

15:39.229 --> 15:42.190
- I'm sure they'll be here soon.
- They wouldn't miss this.

15:42.358 --> 15:47.362
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters,
and the baby's at zero station.

15:50.699 --> 15:52.575
Okay, you are really frightening me.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.580
Somebody wanna help me?
Trying to rip out my heart.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.210
Uh... Oh, that's great.
Anybody seen a nipple?

16:03.754 --> 16:06.464
All right. Ten centimeters. Here we go.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.926
- All right, honey, time to start pushing.
- But they're not here yet.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.220
Sorry, I can't tell the baby
to wait for them.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.223
Oh, God.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.228
Okay, got the vent open.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.813
Hi, I'm Ben.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.359
I'm hospital worker Ben.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.361
It's Ben to the rescue.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.947
- La, la, la
- Okay, okay, okay.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.198
- Ben, you ready?
- Yeah.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.033
- All right, give me your foot.
- Okay.

16:34.201 --> 16:38.204
- Okay, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Unh.
- Ooh.

16:38.747 --> 16:42.583
- Come on, Ben. Okay. That's it, Ben.
- Okay. Uh-huh.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.460
What do you see?

16:44.628 --> 16:48.381
Well, Susan,
I see what appears to be a dark vent.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.882
Wait.

16:50.050 --> 16:53.594
Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.891
Pheebs, it's open! It's open!

17:01.770 --> 17:05.231
Wait! You forgot your legs!

17:05.983 --> 17:08.026
- Push. Push.
- We're here!

17:10.029 --> 17:12.821
- We're here.
- Where have you been?!

17:12.990 --> 17:14.115
Long story, honey.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.451
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing.

17:16.617 --> 17:18.411
I need... Excuse me, can I have this?

17:18.662 --> 17:20.246
Oh, sorry.

17:20.455 --> 17:21.664
All right, all right.

17:21.832 --> 17:24.916
There's too many people in this room.
There's about to be one more.

17:25.085 --> 17:29.464
So anybody who's not an ex-husband
or a lesbian life partner, out you go.

17:29.631 --> 17:31.340
- Come on, out.
- Okay, good luck.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.676
- Bye, bye, bye.
- Good luck, you guys, good luck.

17:33.886 --> 17:37.805
Let me ask you, do you have to be
Carol's lesbian life partner?

17:37.973 --> 17:39.515
Out.

17:40.809 --> 17:43.227
All right.
All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.230
Let me see. I gotta see, I gotta see.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.066
Oh... Oh.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.319
Oh! A head.

17:51.487 --> 17:54.489
Oh. It's huge.
Carol, how are you doing this?

17:55.783 --> 17:57.825
Not helping.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.952
You're doing great. You're doing fine.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.121
- Hello?
- Oh, sorry.

18:02.289 --> 18:04.248
What do you see? What do you see?

18:04.458 --> 18:06.959
We got a head, we got shoulders,
we got arms, we got...

18:07.127 --> 18:10.171
Oh, look at the little... The fingers.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.672
Oh, a chest and a stomach...

18:11.840 --> 18:14.759
...and it's a boy, definitely a boy.

18:14.968 --> 18:18.262
All right. Okay, legs, knees and feet.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.514
Oh, oh.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.687
He's here. He's...

18:27.147 --> 18:28.439
He's a person.

18:28.649 --> 18:29.690
Oh!

18:29.858 --> 18:31.859
- Look at that.
- What does he look like?

18:32.528 --> 18:36.030
Kind of like my Uncle Ed,
covered in Jell-O.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.032
Really?

18:38.659 --> 18:40.743
You guys, he's beautiful.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.329
Aw, thanks, Pheebs.

18:49.002 --> 18:53.673
No shouting,
but we still need a name for this little guy.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.717
How about Ben?

18:57.219 --> 18:59.011
I like Ben.

18:59.179 --> 19:02.557
Ben.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.935
- Ha, ha. Ben's good.
- Yeah?

19:06.103 --> 19:08.187
How come you never
mentioned Ben before?

19:08.355 --> 19:11.440
- We, uh, just cooked it up.
- Ha, ha.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.777
That's what we were off doing.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.029
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:17.197 --> 19:19.782
- Can we come in?
- Yeah, come in. Come in.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.749
I know. I know.

19:28.917 --> 19:31.752
Everybody,
there's someone I'd like you to meet.

19:32.421 --> 19:33.921
Yeah. This is Ben.

19:34.631 --> 19:35.673
- Hi, Ben.
- Hi, Ben.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.634
- Ben, this is everybody.
- Hey, Ben.

19:38.802 --> 19:41.637
Susan, he looks just like you.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.808
Thanks. Ha, ha.

19:45.976 --> 19:49.312
Oh, God, I can't believe one of us
actually has one of these.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.981
I know. I still am one of these.

19:54.568 --> 19:55.818
- Ross?
- Yeah?

19:55.986 --> 19:57.528
Can I?

19:59.114 --> 20:03.034
Okay, the head, the head. You gotta...

20:06.038 --> 20:10.374
Hi, Ben. Hi.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.336
I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes, I am.

20:13.503 --> 20:16.255
I'm your Aunt Monica.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.508
I...

20:21.178 --> 20:23.054
I will always have gum.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.268
Ben...

20:29.436 --> 20:32.772
...I want you to know
that there may be some times...

20:32.940 --> 20:35.650
...when I may not be around...

20:35.817 --> 20:37.401
...like this.

20:39.988 --> 20:42.949
But I'll still always come back...

20:43.742 --> 20:45.576
...like this.

20:46.662 --> 20:50.539
And sometimes I may be away longer...

20:50.707 --> 20:52.375
...like this.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.464
But I'll still always come back...

21:01.009 --> 21:02.843
...like this.

21:03.971 --> 21:09.016
And sometimes I'll want you to steal third,
and I'll go like this.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.610
Oh, he is so amazing.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.238
Yeah, I know. Look at him.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.950
Ben.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.785
Hey, Ben.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.664
Nothing. I don't think that's his name.

21:32.749 --> 21:35.876
Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.921
Oh, look, he's opening his eyes.

21:41.091 --> 21:43.551
He doesn't do much, does he?

21:43.719 --> 21:46.554
Nope, this is pretty much it.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.981
- You guys wanna get some coffee?
- Yeah.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.984
All right, I'll see you guys later.

22:08.910 --> 22:10.703
Hi, Ben.

22:10.871 --> 22:13.789
- I love you.
- Hi, Ben.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.561
Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
