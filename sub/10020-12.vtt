WEBVTT

00:04.244 --> 00:06.924
ER

00:06.925 --> 00:08.485
Previously on ER...

00:08.486 --> 00:09.766
We are going take care of you.

00:09.767 --> 00:11.146
- Oh, God!
- What?

00:11.447 --> 00:15.215
Are you questioning my commitment
to this patient's best interests?

00:15.216 --> 00:16.366
I got it under control.

00:16.401 --> 00:18.787
So does every street junkie
coming through here.

00:18.788 --> 00:21.915
Greg Powell. Paramedic who
brought the boy in the chimney.

00:21.916 --> 00:23.608
Don, let me draw some the easy way.

00:23.677 --> 00:26.507
or I'll get every nurse to hold you down
and they'll draw it the hard way.

00:26.542 --> 00:28.902
He simply wants to keep an eye on me.

00:29.603 --> 00:31.480
Don't you Dr. Benton?

00:31.959 --> 00:34.843
"Sharp Relief"

00:36.253 --> 00:38.337
DOCTORS ROOM

00:38.908 --> 00:41.234
Hey, I hope that's not all
you're wearing.

00:41.454 --> 00:43.578
It's gotta be 10 below out there.

00:44.917 --> 00:47.836
- What?
- How you hide all that hair in that hat.

00:48.047 --> 00:51.500
- The Eighth Wonder of the World.
- You laugh away, Elvis.

00:52.262 --> 00:55.964
They give me the coldest day of the year
to do my paramedic ride-along.

00:56.184 --> 00:58.262
I'm gonna go re-grout the tub...

00:58.438 --> 01:00.266
...then watch some daytime TV.

01:00.441 --> 01:04.522
Springer's doing a special on teens
impregnated by transvestites and-

01:04.697 --> 01:05.777
Get out of here.

01:05.949 --> 01:08.109
All right, Dearborn and Clark, 5:00?

01:08.328 --> 01:09.788
I wrote it down.

01:09.997 --> 01:12.869
I really hate surprises.
I'd like you to tell me.

01:13.085 --> 01:15.375
I can't, because I really
love surprises.

01:15.589 --> 01:18.164
All right, then Dearborn
and Clark at 5:00.

01:18.385 --> 01:20.094
Okay. Hey.

01:22.266 --> 01:23.512
Say it.

01:23.685 --> 01:25.144
Say what?

01:25.312 --> 01:29.229
You know, what I always say first.
You say it.

01:30.696 --> 01:32.155
I love you.

01:32.365 --> 01:33.990
Sounds good to me.

01:36.037 --> 01:38.660
- Is that Scott Anspaugh's CT?
- It sure it.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.114
- Hey, Jeanie.
- Hi.

01:40.294 --> 01:43.082
I'm Dr. Romano. I don't believe
we've met. Are you new?

01:43.298 --> 01:45.257
I'm a physician's assistant in the ER.

01:45.468 --> 01:47.011
I didn't know you were in this.

01:47.179 --> 01:50.016
It's the Chief of Staff's kid.
Everybody wants in.

01:50.184 --> 01:52.308
Dr. Anspaugh requested
I start Scott's lines.

01:52.521 --> 01:55.559
Anspaugh's no fool.
You start more lines with sugar.

01:57.821 --> 01:58.936
What's the verdict?

01:59.782 --> 02:01.859
He's obstructed.
He'll need surgery.

02:02.035 --> 02:03.317
Oh, man.

02:03.913 --> 02:06.536
- Thanks.
- Hey, can I get a decaf from you?

02:06.751 --> 02:08.329
It's 7:30 in the morning.

02:08.544 --> 02:11.797
I've been so jumpy, any caffeine,
I'd blow an aneurysm.

02:12.009 --> 02:14.169
- Lovely.
- Can we sit somewhere else?

02:14.388 --> 02:15.847
It's the smoking section.

02:16.057 --> 02:17.600
Fell off the gum wagon, did you?

02:17.810 --> 02:20.384
- Oh, don't start.
- Wouldn't dream of it.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.477
What's up?
You're making me nervous.

02:27.074 --> 02:28.783
- This.
- You shouldn't have.

02:28.993 --> 02:30.488
Open it up. Open that up.

02:31.247 --> 02:33.287
When did you guys pick these out?

02:33.500 --> 02:36.419
"We" didn't.
I'm gonna surprise her.

02:36.630 --> 02:38.588
I told her to meet me downtown...

02:38.758 --> 02:41.927
...and then we're gonna get
our marriage license.

02:43.265 --> 02:44.297
That is a surprise.

02:44.475 --> 02:46.268
I want to show her I'm serious.

02:47.063 --> 02:48.606
Sounds like a big night.

02:48.815 --> 02:51.390
And then I'm gonna get a limo...

02:51.611 --> 02:54.899
...and we're going
to the Ironhedge Lodge in Dundee.

02:55.117 --> 02:59.247
One minute after midnight, the Justice
of the Peace will do the ceremony.

02:59.749 --> 03:01.125
That sounds great.

03:01.919 --> 03:04.625
Now, all right,
what would make it perfect...

03:04.840 --> 03:07.961
...is if you would agree
to be the best man.

03:08.888 --> 03:10.003
Think you have to ask?

03:10.182 --> 03:12.804
- Yeah? You'd do that?
- I'd be honored.

03:14.814 --> 03:16.143
I can't believe it.

03:16.358 --> 03:20.227
Every other woman I went out with,
I knew it was wrong.

03:20.447 --> 03:23.319
Now I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life with her.

03:23.535 --> 03:25.612
I'm talking like an idiot here.

03:25.830 --> 03:29.118
You're acting like somebody who'll
be a husband tomorrow morning.

03:29.336 --> 03:31.330
A husband. Can you imagine that?

03:33.000 --> 03:39.074

04:25.669 --> 04:27.793
Hey, Carol! You ready to go?

04:28.006 --> 04:29.798
Yeah. Here, let me help you.

04:29.967 --> 04:32.803
- What have you got here?
- Saline, gauze, etcetera.

04:33.012 --> 04:35.552
I got the fisheye
from a guy at the desk.

04:35.767 --> 04:37.594
It's the same with the clinic.

04:37.811 --> 04:41.146
County supplies are County supplies.
Everyone else, back off.

04:42.192 --> 04:43.355
Got the heat going?

04:43.569 --> 04:46.144
Yeah. Powell's got dibs
on music until noon.

04:46.365 --> 04:49.617
Doris doesn't appreciate
quality musical entertainment.

04:49.829 --> 04:51.656
- You ride together?
- Not usually.

04:51.873 --> 04:53.831
I guess I woke up blessed
this morning.

04:54.001 --> 04:55.081
Greg Powell, right?

04:55.295 --> 04:56.873
Good memory, Nurse Hathaway.

05:01.136 --> 05:03.545
- What do we got?
- Pain with vaginal bleeding.

05:03.765 --> 05:07.136
She's shocky. We did two liters
of saline in the field.

05:07.354 --> 05:10.937
Let's get a CBC, type and cross-match
six units to start.

05:11.150 --> 05:15.399
Looks like a ruptured ectopic.
Get her up to the O.R. right now!

05:15.615 --> 05:18.534
Aren't you guys
from Lady of Pity catchment area?

05:18.703 --> 05:21.990
Why'd you endanger her life
by bringing her all the way here?

05:22.208 --> 05:24.367
Because Lady of Pity's
ER is closed.

05:24.545 --> 05:27.417
- You're the closest receiving.
- That's 10 minutes.

05:27.633 --> 05:29.211
- Tell me about it.
- O-neg!

05:29.427 --> 05:32.548
All right. Hang two units.
She's hypovolemic.

05:41.193 --> 05:42.225
Who's fighting?

05:42.403 --> 05:44.231
I'm Spinal and that's Sabrewulf.

05:44.407 --> 05:47.029
I was doing okay,
but then he sabre-stomped me.

05:47.411 --> 05:49.700
Oh, he did the fireball. I'm dead.

05:49.914 --> 05:52.751
Hey, I want to talk to you
about this surgery.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.378
My dad talked all that noise.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.665
I know. Would you
give me a hand here?

05:56.841 --> 05:59.215
I just want to talk to you about it too.

06:02.265 --> 06:04.508
The tumor you had last year is back.

06:05.186 --> 06:07.097
They need to operate to remove it.

06:07.315 --> 06:09.687
I'm not having any more operations.

06:10.443 --> 06:12.568
- I know you're scared.
- I'm not scared.

06:12.780 --> 06:14.904
I'm just sick of all their crap.

06:15.201 --> 06:18.903
"This is the last one, Scotty. "
"Got it all, Scotty. "

06:19.123 --> 06:23.122
Yeah. Hey, if you don't
have this surgery, you're gonna die.

06:24.130 --> 06:26.124
Good. I'd rather die.

06:28.512 --> 06:29.626
Okay.

06:30.305 --> 06:34.934
Guess I'll find someone else to share
my Blackhawks/Islanders tickets with.

06:35.146 --> 06:37.306
Nice try.
Like you're a hockey fan.

06:37.525 --> 06:40.443
Girls can't like bone-crushing,
high-sticking action?

06:41.655 --> 06:43.981
Okay. Who's Tony Esposito?

06:44.200 --> 06:46.693
Blackhawks goalie.
Vezina Trophy winner...

06:46.913 --> 06:48.325
...'70 and '72.

06:49.082 --> 06:50.328
Not bad.

06:50.501 --> 06:52.910
What do you care?
You're fixing to die, so...

06:53.547 --> 06:55.671
So you really got those tickets?

06:58.304 --> 07:01.259
Post-op, day two. Wound is
granulating well without drainage.

07:01.475 --> 07:03.801
- Afebrile on cefotetan.
- Okay.

07:04.021 --> 07:06.774
Next. Lizzie! Long time no see!

07:06.983 --> 07:09.190
Dr. Romano, did you get my message?

07:09.361 --> 07:12.447
I wanted to be excused
from the Anspaugh tumor resection.

07:12.658 --> 07:14.533
And why would that be, doctor?

07:14.703 --> 07:18.536
I'd like to assist Dr. Kotlowitz
on Allison's vocal cord surgery.

07:18.749 --> 07:19.948
No problem.

07:20.168 --> 07:22.411
Never had you scheduled
in the first place.

07:22.630 --> 07:24.125
But my name was on the board.

07:24.341 --> 07:28.886
You're doing so much head-and-neck,
I thought you were changing specialties.

07:29.098 --> 07:31.637
Of course not. It's only this case.

07:31.852 --> 07:35.472
Nothing to worry about.
I taught her everything she knows. Next!

07:37.945 --> 07:40.899
Ellis, is it true Lady of Pity's ER
is closed?

07:41.115 --> 07:44.568
Oh, no. Not closed. But they're not
accepting paramedic traffic.

07:44.746 --> 07:47.618
Well, critical cases
don't tend to be walk-ins.

07:47.834 --> 07:48.864
What's the matter?

07:49.043 --> 07:52.628
I just had a woman nearly bleed out
because she was in an ambulance...

07:52.840 --> 07:54.419
...for 15 minutes too long.

07:54.635 --> 07:59.382
That's bad. It's cases like hers that
forced SPG to reconfigure their ER.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.059
I don't understand.

08:01.269 --> 08:03.642
They had a substandard
trauma panel...

08:03.856 --> 08:06.265
...and their surgical coverage
was spotty at best.

08:06.485 --> 08:09.855
Soon as we get new docs and upgrade
equipment, she'll be back up.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.272
How soon will that be?

08:11.450 --> 08:12.862
The sooner the better.

08:13.078 --> 08:15.487
- Is she okay?
- She'll probably live.

08:15.707 --> 08:17.913
She had the best care
in the world, that's why.

08:18.084 --> 08:19.627
She was lucky. That's why.

08:20.004 --> 08:22.757
Mr. Dwyer, we're ready
to start the procedure.

08:22.967 --> 08:24.130
Is that a toothpick?

08:24.344 --> 08:27.714
Yes, but in your case, this is
a state-of-the-art medical device.

08:27.932 --> 08:30.934
You may have contracted dracunculosis
from the river water.

08:31.145 --> 08:32.474
Dracuncu-what?

08:32.940 --> 08:33.971
Guinea worm?

08:34.150 --> 08:36.143
Native to North Africa
and the Middle East.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.145
It's from drinking
contaminated water.

08:38.322 --> 08:42.072
It moves through your system
and then lays its eggs below your skin.

08:42.285 --> 08:45.823
Wait. A worm has been crawling
through me for almost a year?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.326
- Yep.
- Why didn't the other doctors catch this?

08:48.503 --> 08:51.790
It presents like an abscess.
When you had it drained it got worse.

08:52.008 --> 08:55.296
- What's to be done?
- Controlled removal.

09:01.439 --> 09:02.470
Sorry.

09:02.690 --> 09:04.933
Harrison says they grow
a meter long.

09:05.612 --> 09:08.233
I really didn't need to hear that.

09:08.657 --> 09:11.363
I got about two centimeters.
Toothpick, please.

09:12.204 --> 09:13.829
And a length of tape.

09:16.335 --> 09:20.085
Keep that taped down, and come back
daily to continue the extraction.

09:20.299 --> 09:23.717
I gotta catch a 6 a. m. flight
to Cairo. Why can't you yank it out?

09:23.929 --> 09:26.800
If we pull more than two centimeters
a day, it'll break off.

09:27.517 --> 09:29.178
I gotta put in for combat pay.

09:29.896 --> 09:31.605
Hey, John?

09:32.733 --> 09:35.142
- Hi, Chase.
- What are you doing here?

09:35.363 --> 09:38.234
I feel nauseous. I remembered
a couple Thanksgivings ago...

09:38.408 --> 09:42.075
...when we had bad pheasants, you
hooked us up with whatever that was.

09:42.956 --> 09:44.368
- Compazine.
- Right.

09:44.542 --> 09:47.579
It worked like a charm.
I thought you'd give me a scrip.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.916
Excuse me for a second.

09:50.926 --> 09:52.551
Come here.

09:52.720 --> 09:57.099
You didn't just drive all the way here
from the Loop to get Compazine.

09:58.478 --> 10:00.887
This isn't what you bring
to the company nurse.

10:01.107 --> 10:03.896
You don't want your parents
to find out about the heroin.

10:04.112 --> 10:05.690
I'm- I'm not!

10:06.740 --> 10:11.239
I mean, I stopped two nights ago.
And I just...

10:11.622 --> 10:13.616
I need something
to get me over the hump.

10:13.792 --> 10:16.628
If you need it to get over
the hump, you're in withdrawal.

10:16.838 --> 10:18.962
Why don't you go to the cafeteria?

10:19.133 --> 10:21.506
And I'll go and I'll get you
into a detox center.

10:21.720 --> 10:22.800
You're overreacting.

10:22.972 --> 10:26.140
You could've gone to any doctor,
but you came to me!

10:26.351 --> 10:27.811
You're asking for my help!

10:28.021 --> 10:29.979
You've read too many
12-step pamphlets!

10:30.191 --> 10:32.315
I can't help if
you slam the door in my face.

10:32.486 --> 10:35.773
You can help me, you just choose not to!
Thank you!

10:37.826 --> 10:40.663
- The best thing to do is let him go.
- Pardon me?

10:41.665 --> 10:43.160
I'm sorry.

10:43.335 --> 10:45.328
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

10:45.838 --> 10:48.246
A friend of mine had a drug problem.

10:48.467 --> 10:51.718
I've had this conversation more
times than you could imagine.

10:51.930 --> 10:53.805
I appreciate it. I can handle this.

10:54.017 --> 10:55.844
I know you don't want to talk...

10:56.019 --> 10:57.811
...but don't let him drag you in.

10:58.022 --> 11:01.227
I'm not gonna get dragged
into anything. Excuse me.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.325
What's in there? Eye of newt?

11:07.494 --> 11:11.446
Cajun Tofu Gumbo.
And don't make that face.

11:12.001 --> 11:15.169
Whatever happened to beef stew
and five-alarm chili?

11:15.380 --> 11:19.795
Olbes is macrobiotic,
me and Zadro are doing that Zone diet.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.555
- Do you have kings?
- Go fish.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.761
I should've taken the P.D. exam.
Hoagies and doughnuts.

11:24.936 --> 11:27.807
- Those guys know how to eat.
- Have any tens?

11:28.524 --> 11:30.316
Carol, please.

11:30.527 --> 11:34.361
Tell me that you're a real American.
Red meat, the occasional brewski.

11:34.575 --> 11:37.197
I admit I'm not a big fan
of nuts and berries.

11:37.370 --> 11:39.660
You hear that?
That's the voice of common sense.

11:39.832 --> 11:42.241
Well, Mickey D's is right
up the street.

11:42.419 --> 11:46.204
I have to say Zadro brought by
incredible flourless carob brownies.

11:46.424 --> 11:48.252
They were good.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.639
Carob? Why bother, bro?

11:51.849 --> 11:54.804
Powell, you really are a caveman.
Eights?

11:55.187 --> 11:56.598
That's us!

11:59.068 --> 12:02.486
More tofu for you there, big daddy!

12:04.201 --> 12:07.286
I had a lumpectomy
and a lap choly on my schedule...

12:07.496 --> 12:10.368
...but when Anspaugh says jump,
I say Sieg heil.

12:10.584 --> 12:13.421
I'm going to transect the ileum
with the GIA stapler.

12:13.589 --> 12:17.837
Reinforce the staple lines with
4-0 silk Lembert sutures.

12:18.053 --> 12:19.963
Reinforcing is very thorough.

12:20.181 --> 12:22.756
Our British colleague isn't
always so detail-oriented.

12:22.936 --> 12:24.596
I haven't noticed that to be true.

12:24.771 --> 12:28.058
Her baby blues would look better
over this bowel than your mug...

12:28.234 --> 12:29.777
...but you know female surgeons.

12:29.945 --> 12:31.986
No, I don't.
Why don't you tell me?

12:32.199 --> 12:35.616
Always something to prove.
Often at the expense of the case.

12:35.787 --> 12:39.573
One of the things I like about you,
you're not a militant minority.

12:41.045 --> 12:43.122
We have the results
of the frozen section.

12:43.340 --> 12:44.751
- B-cell lymphoma?
- Yes.

12:44.966 --> 12:47.340
- Damn!
- I knew it.

12:47.554 --> 12:51.304
Someone's gonna have to tell Anspaugh,
and I am voting for you, Peter.

12:55.690 --> 12:57.316
Excuse me.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.609
Dr. Weaver, glad you could join us.

12:59.822 --> 13:02.990
I was explaining our plan
to pursue industrial contracts.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.153
Can I speak to you for a minute?

13:05.454 --> 13:06.534
Sure. Sure.

13:06.748 --> 13:09.121
I'm sorry.
The ER doesn't stop for lunch.

13:09.335 --> 13:12.373
Go take a seat, and we'll join you
as soon as we can.

13:12.590 --> 13:14.132
Thanks. What's up?

13:14.342 --> 13:16.170
I've been doing a little research.

13:16.387 --> 13:20.600
SPG closed 60 percent of their trauma
centers in the Midwest. Why is that?

13:20.810 --> 13:22.685
- Where did you hear that?
- The Internet.

13:22.855 --> 13:24.682
I wish you had come to me first.

13:24.857 --> 13:27.432
You know, I did.
You gave me the party line.

13:27.653 --> 13:30.988
Since I don't know where you got
your figures, I can't address them.

13:31.158 --> 13:36.036
I can say a 60 percent downgrade by
itself doesn't reflect our reconfiguration.

13:36.207 --> 13:38.284
Ellis, it's me. You can speak English.

13:38.502 --> 13:40.994
Okay. Let me give you an example:

13:41.214 --> 13:45.047
Kellogg Memorial in Detroit was
a shambles as an acute-care facility.

13:45.261 --> 13:47.219
Now it's a national
hernia center.

13:47.431 --> 13:49.639
That does you no good
with a stab wound.

13:49.810 --> 13:52.563
Neither does a hospital bankrupted
by unreimbursed care.

13:52.773 --> 13:55.015
Emergency care is only for
people who can pay?

13:55.192 --> 13:56.521
You're twisting my words.

13:56.736 --> 14:00.237
- You're avoiding my questions.
- I'm not avoiding your questions!

14:00.575 --> 14:03.743
Look, if you're worried
about County, don't.

14:03.913 --> 14:06.405
You're essential.
You're not going anywhere.

14:06.750 --> 14:10.168
If everyone else closes,
someone needs to handle the trauma.

14:11.216 --> 14:13.422
- Are you going to lunch?
- No. I'm not hungry.

14:15.763 --> 14:17.840
What to pick? What to pick?

14:18.058 --> 14:20.432
- Dr. Carter, you got messages.
- From who?

14:20.604 --> 14:22.432
They were all from your cousin Chase.

14:22.649 --> 14:25.816
He says you can phone the prescription
to De Gooyer's Pharmacy.

14:26.028 --> 14:27.607
Unbelievable.

14:27.822 --> 14:29.781
I need your John Hancock on this.

14:29.951 --> 14:32.075
- Hey, Malik.
- Jeanie, what's up?

14:32.246 --> 14:35.200
- Still got a friend at Startime Tickets?
- Sure. What you need?

14:35.375 --> 14:39.161
I need a couple of rinkside Blackhawks
Islanders tickets on the 20th.

14:39.381 --> 14:42.467
And I want world peace
and a date with Tyra Banks.

14:42.635 --> 14:43.798
Can you get them?

14:43.970 --> 14:45.631
You know that's gonna run you.

14:45.848 --> 14:47.047
That's okay. Just ask.

14:47.267 --> 14:50.435
If you're living that fat,
I might need to date you.

14:52.233 --> 14:54.807
Hey, Chase. It's John.
You there? Pick up.

14:56.447 --> 15:00.114
Call me back when you get this.
I'm at work. You know the number.

15:00.411 --> 15:01.740
So, Allison...

15:01.955 --> 15:04.992
...see, the two cords on the screen
need to touch...

15:05.209 --> 15:08.960
...and vibrate in order for you
to regain your voice.

15:09.382 --> 15:12.253
But as it is now,
the left one is paralyzed.

15:13.888 --> 15:16.677
If you understand me, blink once
for yes, twice for no.

15:17.769 --> 15:20.440
Good. Dr. Corday, you here to observe?

15:20.899 --> 15:23.355
I'm actually here for Allison
if she doesn't mind.

15:23.569 --> 15:26.655
Oh, fine. I was just
explaining the procedure.

15:26.865 --> 15:30.782
All right. Now I'm going
to make a slight incision.

15:31.122 --> 15:34.788
You should only feel a little bit
of pressure. Okay?

15:36.796 --> 15:40.132
Kerry! Why aren't you at
that big SPG luncheon?

15:40.343 --> 15:42.170
I had some work to do.

15:42.387 --> 15:45.722
Everything seems to be trucking
right along, though.

15:45.892 --> 15:49.513
For the most part, sure.
But this is a big step we're taking.

15:49.732 --> 15:54.146
I agree. Thanks to you, we're lighting
a fire to institute some real change.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.196
I think we should be
100 percent sure...

15:56.366 --> 16:00.781
...that turning the ER over to an outside
management group is what we want.

16:00.998 --> 16:02.326
Well, isn't it?

16:02.499 --> 16:04.576
On paper, sure.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.249
Is something the matter?

16:06.422 --> 16:07.751
No. No, not at all.

16:07.966 --> 16:11.502
I just thought we could delay
the board vote a week or two-

16:11.721 --> 16:13.549
Dr. Anspaugh.

16:13.766 --> 16:16.222
Dr. Benton, how can I help you?

16:16.687 --> 16:20.437
Well, we got the results
of Scott's frozen section.

16:21.318 --> 16:22.350
All right.

16:23.237 --> 16:25.908
- We can discuss this later.
- Now is fine.

16:27.703 --> 16:29.032
Let's see.

16:30.415 --> 16:32.289
There's a recurrence of his lymphoma.

16:35.881 --> 16:40.795
We won't know if we got it all until
we take a look at the tumor margins.

16:42.348 --> 16:44.140
Do you see any serosal seeding?

16:44.309 --> 16:45.685
No.

16:46.187 --> 16:49.356
What about infiltration
to the liver or spleen?

16:49.567 --> 16:51.275
No metastasis.

16:55.367 --> 16:56.696
Okay.

16:56.869 --> 16:59.788
Well, continue then.

17:00.333 --> 17:03.418
Let me know when Scott is awake.

17:04.171 --> 17:05.963
So, Kerry, where were we?

17:08.720 --> 17:09.917
Ha! You owe me a dollar.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.839
I only smoked half a cigarette.

17:12.015 --> 17:13.843
Half a cigarette is still a cigarette.

17:14.019 --> 17:17.021
At this rate, we're gonna be
in Club Med by February.

17:17.190 --> 17:21.770
Not true, that was my last one.
I'm going back on the gum tonight.

17:21.988 --> 17:23.945
You know what
we could do tonight?

17:24.116 --> 17:25.195
- S'mores.
- Excuse me?

17:25.367 --> 17:29.035
Do you remember camp? Marshmallows,
graham crackers, chocolate?

17:29.249 --> 17:32.370
I'd love to but I can't, okay?
I gotta do something.

17:32.587 --> 17:34.331
- What?
- It's for Doug.

17:34.548 --> 17:37.219
Maybe Saturday night?
I'll bring the marshmallows?

17:37.386 --> 17:40.174
- Dr. Greene?
- What's up, Carter?

17:41.015 --> 17:42.925
Could I have the rest of this shift off?

17:43.102 --> 17:44.561
- Why?
- Family emergency.

17:44.771 --> 17:46.147
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

17:46.357 --> 17:47.816
Things I need to take care of.

17:47.984 --> 17:50.440
- Well, I'll let Doyle know.
- Thanks.

17:54.911 --> 17:57.913
- Hey, Carter.
- Hey. What are you eating?

17:58.833 --> 18:00.458
PB and J on wheat.

18:01.044 --> 18:03.881
- I thought you were on until 7.
- I was.

18:04.257 --> 18:05.289
You feeling okay?

18:06.427 --> 18:07.756
Yeah, fine.

18:09.098 --> 18:11.720
It's the middle of your shift.
It's about your cousin.

18:12.435 --> 18:13.895
I know what I'm doing.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.268
You don't look like you do.

18:18.111 --> 18:20.781
And you don't know anything
about my family, so drop it.

18:22.617 --> 18:23.648
Oh, come on!

18:23.869 --> 18:26.539
One more flight! Apartment 3H.
Oh, hurry, hurry!

18:26.706 --> 18:30.456
Please hurry! In here! In here!
Oh, please!

18:34.467 --> 18:36.212
Oh, my God! She's dead.

18:36.804 --> 18:38.964
- She's dead.
- No, she's not dead.

18:39.141 --> 18:40.172
Are you okay?

18:40.350 --> 18:42.510
- Do something.
- Some help here.

18:42.729 --> 18:44.604
- Do something.
- Some help here!

18:44.815 --> 18:46.643
- How long you been here?
- Five minutes.

18:46.818 --> 18:49.227
- She wasn't breathing.
- Get her out of here!

18:49.446 --> 18:50.610
I got a faint pulse.

18:50.782 --> 18:51.814
All right, I'm here.

18:51.992 --> 18:55.659
Oh, God! No! I love you, Mom!

18:57.500 --> 18:59.043
I'm gonna start an IV.

18:59.211 --> 19:00.242
Stand back.

19:00.462 --> 19:02.670
Come on. Please, please, please.

19:02.883 --> 19:04.627
- IV's in.
- BP's 60 palp.

19:05.846 --> 19:06.877
She's in fib.

19:07.056 --> 19:09.512
All right. Charge it to 200. Clear!

19:09.976 --> 19:11.970
- Nothing.
- Come on, damn it!

19:12.188 --> 19:14.347
Charging 300! Clear!

19:14.942 --> 19:16.188
- Nope.
- Again.

19:16.361 --> 19:18.189
Charging 360. Clear.

19:18.364 --> 19:20.107
- Oh, Mama. Please help her.
- Nothing!

19:20.324 --> 19:21.985
Help her! Help her!

19:22.202 --> 19:26.249
Come on, breathe! Don't you die
on me! Don't you frigging die!

19:26.459 --> 19:28.499
- Powell!
- An amp of epi!

19:32.884 --> 19:34.878
I shouldn't have left her.

19:38.309 --> 19:39.471
I got a pulse.

19:42.106 --> 19:45.144
I love you so much. Don't leave me!

19:45.319 --> 19:49.863
Allison, it's imperative that you
hold perfectly still. All right?

19:50.033 --> 19:52.407
This is the home stretch.
You're doing well.

19:52.579 --> 19:55.416
All right. Now I'm gonna ask you...

19:55.625 --> 19:58.995
...to swallow for me if you can.

19:59.255 --> 20:01.581
Oh, good. Now can you say "E"?

20:04.555 --> 20:07.261
That's okay.
You just need to clear the secretions.

20:07.434 --> 20:09.427
All right, good. Let's try again.

20:09.603 --> 20:10.932
You can do it, Allison.

20:16.655 --> 20:18.115
Doctor, you're a genius.

20:18.324 --> 20:22.110
I'm just doing my job, that's all.
You did good, kid.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.784
Let's prepare to close her.

20:24.416 --> 20:26.042
Thank you.

20:26.211 --> 20:28.785
You have the rest of your life to talk.

20:32.762 --> 20:35.930
Let's get a CBC, Chem-7,
blood gas, portable chest.

20:36.142 --> 20:38.763
- Pulse weak.
- Start dopamine at 10 mics per kilo.

20:38.937 --> 20:39.968
Pulse ox 88.

20:40.147 --> 20:41.772
Call Respiratory for a vent.

20:41.983 --> 20:44.392
BP's 60 palp.
Idioventricular rhythm at 50.

20:44.612 --> 20:46.938
- I lost her pulse.
- She's cyanotic.

20:47.158 --> 20:48.865
- We should go.
- I'll get a blood gas.

20:49.076 --> 20:51.450
Come on. Let's go.

20:52.289 --> 20:54.782
Let's start dopamine. Atropine.

21:06.018 --> 21:07.299
What are you doing here?

21:07.478 --> 21:09.056
You asked me to help.

21:11.442 --> 21:15.572
That's really decent of you, man.
But- But I'm fine.

21:16.700 --> 21:20.070
You left messages for me every
half an hour. Now you're fine?

21:20.538 --> 21:22.947
I was just panicked, you know?

21:23.167 --> 21:26.585
You know how it is when you're sick.
You think the world's gonna end.

21:27.381 --> 21:28.413
Invite me in.

21:29.551 --> 21:31.675
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

21:34.809 --> 21:36.684
It smells like a locker room.

21:36.895 --> 21:39.102
When was the last time
the maid came by?

21:40.692 --> 21:42.353
She quit.

21:46.493 --> 21:49.198
So since you're here,
did you bring any meds?

21:49.413 --> 21:50.789
No.

21:50.957 --> 21:53.283
I brought a list
of drug treatment centers.

21:55.380 --> 21:59.426
Come on, man! I'm not one
of those Betty Ford people. I-

21:59.928 --> 22:02.966
Half my graduating class
from Westlane's in rehab.

22:03.725 --> 22:07.510
I'd bump into somebody I know,
and then tongues would wag.

22:08.398 --> 22:10.392
Take a look at yourself, Chase.

22:10.902 --> 22:12.065
You're a mess.

22:12.446 --> 22:14.404
Thank you, Mr. Blackwell.

22:15.743 --> 22:18.910
You know, I'd love to hang out,
but I gotta...

22:19.122 --> 22:20.747
I was just gonna head out.

22:20.916 --> 22:21.948
Give me a break.

22:30.430 --> 22:31.462
You gonna answer that?

22:36.605 --> 22:38.314
Chase, buddy! What's up, dude?

22:38.525 --> 22:42.441
Sorry it took me so long to get here.
I was in the middle of a squash game...

22:42.614 --> 22:44.608
...and I didn't feel my pager vibrate.

22:44.784 --> 22:47.952
- That's all right.
- I got you a few grams of the usual...

22:48.163 --> 22:49.623
...and check this out:

22:49.791 --> 22:52.462
A gram of this.
This is some superb Mexican-

22:52.670 --> 22:54.878
- I think you better go.
- Who's this guy?

22:55.091 --> 22:58.626
- He's my cousin.
- Your cousin needs to learn manners.

22:58.804 --> 23:00.631
- Anyway-
- I don't think you heard me-

23:00.848 --> 23:04.385
Wait a minute. Last I knew,
this was Chase's house, okay?

23:04.604 --> 23:07.725
Why not go make yourself
a hot toddy and let us talk?

23:07.942 --> 23:10.516
Chase, if you do this,
you are on your own.

23:10.738 --> 23:12.815
Oh, you know what? You know what?

23:13.033 --> 23:15.525
What'll it be?
Do you want this or not?

23:15.745 --> 23:18.153
Yeah? Is that a yeah?
Yeah. All right.

23:18.373 --> 23:21.993
Gardner... You better go.

23:24.007 --> 23:26.296
You know where to find me
when Mommy's gone.

23:26.468 --> 23:27.500
Get out of here.

23:44.536 --> 23:46.992
- Last epi?
- High dose, three minutes ago.

23:47.206 --> 23:48.452
Total time down?

23:48.667 --> 23:50.210
Thirty minutes.

23:51.338 --> 23:52.501
Let's call it:

23:52.715 --> 23:55.633
Time of death, 4:02 p. m.

23:59.432 --> 24:03.218
Dr. Greene, I'm Detective Gerald Leo,
District Eleven, Violent Crimes.

24:03.397 --> 24:06.232
This is Detective Laibson.
Could we have a minute?

24:06.400 --> 24:09.189
- And the other cops?
- Suspect's crossed district lines.

24:09.405 --> 24:10.983
This guy's going all over?

24:11.199 --> 24:14.617
This is an open investigation.
We can't discuss the specifics.

24:14.788 --> 24:16.068
About Louise Dickinson-

24:16.248 --> 24:18.158
I haven't heard anything on the news.

24:18.376 --> 24:21.544
This has to be handled carefully.
We have suspects.

24:21.756 --> 24:25.625
I have three victims from some sick
bastard. There could be more.

24:25.845 --> 24:29.631
Not that my friendly police department
is telling me anything.

24:29.851 --> 24:31.346
You have to calm down.

24:31.937 --> 24:33.931
Right. I gotta pull myself together.

24:34.107 --> 24:37.727
I gotta tell Louise's daughter
that her mother's going to the morgue.

24:37.946 --> 24:40.403
We need more Kerlix and saline.

24:43.496 --> 24:45.120
Powell, are you okay?

24:45.373 --> 24:47.532
You haven't said a word since we left.

24:47.710 --> 24:48.873
There's nothing to say.

24:50.714 --> 24:53.171
Some things you never
get used to seeing.

24:54.303 --> 24:56.675
When we got to that apartment,
you really froze.

24:56.848 --> 24:58.224
I apologize.

24:58.392 --> 25:00.635
No, it's not that. I just...

25:01.188 --> 25:03.312
If you'd like to talk about anything...

25:04.317 --> 25:05.692
Not really.

25:09.324 --> 25:10.653
What's that?

25:16.209 --> 25:17.454
It's her, all right.

25:17.627 --> 25:19.039
Let me see.

25:23.178 --> 25:25.170
Fifty-five cents off Meow Mix.

25:26.181 --> 25:27.676
I didn't see a cat. Did you?

25:28.101 --> 25:29.181
No.

25:30.939 --> 25:33.182
Someone should go
and see if it's okay.

25:35.486 --> 25:37.895
Dr. Anspaugh, how's Scott?

25:39.242 --> 25:41.948
He'll have to have
another round of chemotherapy.

25:45.375 --> 25:50.206
How do you tell a boy he's going
to be in and out of the hospital...

25:50.425 --> 25:53.925
...for painful, debilitating
treatments for God knows how long?

25:54.138 --> 25:55.716
It's not easy.

25:55.890 --> 25:58.217
Imagine how it is for Scott,
not knowing.

26:00.272 --> 26:02.065
Well, frankly, he could...

26:03.902 --> 26:05.065
We could use some help.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.743
Scott responds to you.

26:11.246 --> 26:14.912
So I was wondering if you might
be interested in being...

26:15.711 --> 26:19.212
...a part-time private-duty
caregiver for him.

26:22.262 --> 26:24.171
What does Scott think about this?

26:24.682 --> 26:26.972
Well, we haven't discussed
it specifically.

26:27.185 --> 26:28.764
I know he thinks highly of you.

26:32.277 --> 26:33.521
As do I.

26:37.993 --> 26:39.618
- If you need time to think-
- No.

26:40.789 --> 26:42.533
No, I'm glad that you asked.

26:43.250 --> 26:44.448
When do I start?

26:51.471 --> 26:55.968
Can you turn the heat up, please?
It's like a meat locker in here.

26:57.562 --> 26:59.355
It's cranked up to 80.

27:00.442 --> 27:03.313
- I'll make some soup.
- I don't want soup!

27:03.529 --> 27:06.068
I am sick! I need something!

27:06.992 --> 27:08.487
I'll make some tea.

27:09.288 --> 27:10.617
I'm gonna vomit.

27:10.873 --> 27:11.905
Wait, wait, wait!

27:17.967 --> 27:21.669
That's okay. Next time you feel
it coming on, use the bowl.

27:21.889 --> 27:24.677
Don't worry about it.
Want to take this shirt off?

27:24.893 --> 27:27.599
I can't do this anymore!
I'm getting out of here.

27:27.814 --> 27:28.846
I'm not gonna let you.

27:29.024 --> 27:32.524
Get off of me! You are not helping!
You are not doing jack!

27:32.696 --> 27:35.568
The only way you're gonna leave
through here is through me!

27:35.784 --> 27:37.444
Fine. I'll call Gardner back.

27:41.542 --> 27:43.535
- Sit down.
- I am sick!

27:43.753 --> 27:46.625
I need something! You gotta help.

27:46.841 --> 27:48.384
- I'm going to help.
- Help me!

27:48.552 --> 27:52.883
I'm gonna help you. I'm gonna help you,
but you gotta stick with me!

27:54.393 --> 27:55.805
Come on.

27:57.231 --> 27:58.726
All right?

28:06.286 --> 28:08.445
- Peter.
- Hey.

28:08.623 --> 28:09.999
How was the Beaumont surgery?

28:10.167 --> 28:13.916
Kotlowitz is optimistic she'll have
full use of her voice in a few weeks.

28:14.088 --> 28:15.583
Oh, congratulations.

28:15.758 --> 28:17.585
How about the Anspaugh boy surgery?

28:17.761 --> 28:20.087
You know, well.
As well as we hoped.

28:20.306 --> 28:21.421
It's been a long day.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.008
I could use a drink. How about you?

28:24.228 --> 28:25.937
No. I don't drink.

28:26.147 --> 28:29.601
Your body's made up of 60 percent
water. You must drink something.

28:29.820 --> 28:31.196
You know what I mean.

28:31.405 --> 28:34.775
Well, have a lemonade
or a Yoo-Hoo for all I care.

28:35.202 --> 28:37.873
I think it'd be criminal
to let this day end so early.

28:38.081 --> 28:40.621
Unless you were gonna
spend time with your son.

28:40.794 --> 28:43.119
- I wouldn't want to-
- He's with his mother.

28:44.006 --> 28:45.086
So?

28:48.680 --> 28:52.548
Yeah, well... Yeah.
You know, I like lemonade.

28:53.311 --> 28:54.723
Splendid.

28:57.985 --> 28:59.065
Can I help you?

28:59.237 --> 29:02.024
We're the EMS team with County.
She had a cat.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.570
Have you seen it?

29:03.743 --> 29:07.160
Nope. Anyone seen a cat around here?

29:07.749 --> 29:09.624
- Sorry.
- Is it okay if we look?

29:09.835 --> 29:11.034
Sure. We're almost done.

29:11.253 --> 29:12.962
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

29:16.511 --> 29:19.847
Sometimes they come running
if they hear a can opener.

29:24.689 --> 29:27.264
Here's some stairs.
Maybe it got to the roof.

29:31.449 --> 29:33.359
Come get your dinner.

29:36.331 --> 29:37.992
I think it hissed at me.

29:38.919 --> 29:40.828
He'll come out eventually.

29:43.216 --> 29:44.759
Pretty up here, huh?

29:45.636 --> 29:47.429
I'm just glad to be out of there.

29:47.639 --> 29:50.132
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

29:51.227 --> 29:54.146
Hey, you're right.
What happened back there, it...

29:54.315 --> 29:55.596
It got to me.

29:56.569 --> 29:58.313
Reminded me of my mom.

29:58.697 --> 30:00.073
Your mom?

30:02.076 --> 30:04.366
When I was 9, she hung herself.

30:06.416 --> 30:08.410
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

30:09.421 --> 30:11.959
Yeah, I was the one that found her.

30:12.925 --> 30:16.842
Seeing that lady, with the ligature marks
and her head turned like that...

30:17.015 --> 30:18.593
...cops all around.

30:19.226 --> 30:22.477
I was pissed, all over again.

30:24.317 --> 30:26.690
I'm sure she didn't mean
for you to find her.

30:26.904 --> 30:28.363
But I did.

30:31.660 --> 30:34.331
Then I started feeling guilty...

30:34.540 --> 30:38.789
...because I was thinking about myself
instead of that old lady.

30:38.963 --> 30:40.956
Like my mom was only
thinking of herself.

30:42.718 --> 30:44.925
What a sick boy I am, huh?

30:46.974 --> 30:49.929
I thought about everybody but me
when I tried to kill myself.

30:54.527 --> 30:56.271
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

30:56.488 --> 30:59.159
Why would you?
It was a long time ago.

30:59.492 --> 31:04.489
I got wrapped up in everyone else's
expectations. I forgot who I was.

31:06.210 --> 31:07.409
And now?

31:08.672 --> 31:10.166
Now I'm okay.

31:11.676 --> 31:14.512
Even tried to go to med school,
but it wasn't me.

31:15.181 --> 31:17.555
Couldn't get the hang
of that 9-iron?

31:18.353 --> 31:19.681
I don't know.

31:21.189 --> 31:22.982
I opened up a clinic in the ER.

31:23.359 --> 31:25.519
It's only open
a couple days a week, but...

31:25.738 --> 31:27.946
But nothing. I mean, that's...

31:28.117 --> 31:29.860
- That's great.
- Yeah.

31:30.661 --> 31:32.536
You're "Supernurse"!

31:34.500 --> 31:37.622
- But what about you?
- Me?

31:38.882 --> 31:40.542
What are you thinking about?

31:45.224 --> 31:49.223
That it's freezing out here, and
I wish that damn cat would come out.

31:50.523 --> 31:53.728
I know it's getting late.
If you got somewhere to be...

32:00.162 --> 32:01.657
No, I'm fine.

32:07.173 --> 32:08.584
What are you thinking about?

32:11.595 --> 32:13.423
I'm thinking I'm not feeling the cold.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.307
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:15.476 --> 32:18.728
And I'm thinking that cat will come out
when she's good and ready.

32:18.897 --> 32:20.606
Probably.

32:22.861 --> 32:26.813
I'm thinking if I look at you one more
second, I'm gonna have to kiss you.

32:54.824 --> 32:56.200
Has anyone seen Carol?

32:56.368 --> 32:59.120
- Not since that ride-along.
- I haven't seen her either.

32:59.330 --> 33:00.908
No one's seen her.

33:01.208 --> 33:04.376
All right. I'll do that.
Okay. Bye.

33:04.880 --> 33:08.048
If anyone sees her, tell her to call Doug.
He's getting worried.

33:08.217 --> 33:10.092
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.

33:15.562 --> 33:18.647
- There you are. You leaving?
- Yeah.

33:19.525 --> 33:22.065
I put together those figures
I promised you.

33:22.238 --> 33:26.404
I thought we could go out to dinner,
talk it over in a more relaxed setting?

33:26.578 --> 33:30.659
Yeah. I think I should
think about this alone.

33:31.752 --> 33:35.122
- Let me give you a hand.
- No. I don't- I'm fine, thanks.

33:35.299 --> 33:38.253
Kerry, what can I do to make you
feel better about this?

33:39.053 --> 33:40.548
Delay the board vote.

33:40.764 --> 33:44.681
I'm willing to give you whatever
information you think you need.

33:44.896 --> 33:47.020
But delaying the vote isn't an option.

33:47.233 --> 33:49.356
I can't support something
I don't believe in.

33:49.527 --> 33:52.019
And it seems SPG puts profits
ahead of patient care.

33:52.239 --> 33:55.111
Synergix provides the most care
for the most people.

33:55.327 --> 33:58.662
If that means giving them an
Oldsmobile instead of a Rolls, so be it.

33:58.832 --> 34:01.502
- Decent care shouldn't be a luxury.
- It shouldn't.

34:01.711 --> 34:03.835
And that's what we give people,
decent care.

34:04.215 --> 34:06.624
- And nothing more?
- More bankrupts hospitals.

34:06.802 --> 34:10.504
I can't be part of an organization
that low-balls people's lives.

34:12.476 --> 34:14.137
That's a cheap shot.

34:15.273 --> 34:17.065
Oh, man!

34:18.819 --> 34:21.440
I just need time alone
to think about this.

34:21.656 --> 34:23.199
About Synergix or me?

34:28.750 --> 34:30.079
Let me give you a ride home.

34:30.252 --> 34:31.996
I'll be fine. Thanks.

34:33.047 --> 34:34.840
Kerry, don't do this.

34:36.303 --> 34:38.841
I don't care if the computer
says it was processed.

34:39.974 --> 34:42.382
Because I phoned
the scrip in hours ago.

34:43.353 --> 34:47.733
If it was processed, then I would
have the meds in my hand right now.

34:49.196 --> 34:50.525
Yeah, I'll hold.

34:52.199 --> 34:53.826
Want some of this?

34:56.456 --> 34:57.915
Finally!

35:03.550 --> 35:05.294
- Hey.
- Anna.

35:05.470 --> 35:06.714
What are you doing here?

35:06.887 --> 35:09.214
You called in a prescription
for Compazine.

35:09.808 --> 35:12.098
You're gonna need more than that.
Trust me.

35:13.564 --> 35:15.059
Come on in.

35:17.027 --> 35:19.400
- Chase.
- Hey, Anna.

35:19.572 --> 35:22.361
Sorry I didn't tidy up.

35:23.078 --> 35:27.124
You should see my brother Hank's place.
It's a Superfund site.

35:29.378 --> 35:32.131
I got clonidine and propranolol.

35:32.341 --> 35:35.593
- Propranolol?
- Yeah. I borrowed it from the ER.

35:36.097 --> 35:39.680
I also got your saline
and rectal Compazine.

35:40.519 --> 35:43.937
Rectal? Do I get my choice of doctors?

35:44.275 --> 35:48.190
I think that's the sort of procedure
you should keep in the family, okay?

35:51.952 --> 35:53.578
I'm gonna get this started.

35:54.832 --> 35:57.999
This'll lower your heart rate
and take the edge off the jitters.

36:01.466 --> 36:02.498
You'll be okay.

36:06.807 --> 36:08.681
Visualize the bull's-eye...

36:08.893 --> 36:11.350
...lean into the throw...

36:11.522 --> 36:13.266
...and release!

36:14.276 --> 36:17.112
- It's easier said than done.
- Try it.

36:21.328 --> 36:23.487
No, you're too stiff!

36:23.665 --> 36:25.243
Wait a minute.

36:27.461 --> 36:29.502
There you go.

36:29.673 --> 36:32.426
Nice aerodynamic form.

36:32.636 --> 36:35.840
Now, a small movement with the wrist.

36:38.686 --> 36:40.810
- That's not bad.
- Can I get you some refills?

36:40.981 --> 36:42.476
I'll have another Newky Brown.

36:42.692 --> 36:45.018
- A Perrier.
- You got it.

36:46.071 --> 36:49.027
- Are you an alcoholic?
- Excuse me?

36:49.201 --> 36:51.076
Is that why you don't drink?

36:51.872 --> 36:52.951
No, no.

36:53.624 --> 36:56.542
Are you a Muslim?
I notice you don't eat pork either.

36:57.045 --> 36:59.502
Nothing against liquor,
I don't like the taste.

36:59.716 --> 37:03.632
- So it's not a control thing?
- No. Of course not.

37:04.849 --> 37:09.311
You know, you should try a Pimm's.
Tastes just like ginger ale and fruit.

37:09.480 --> 37:10.560
No, thank you.

37:10.732 --> 37:13.520
You're so resistant
to new things, Peter.

37:13.736 --> 37:14.816
We'll shoot for it.

37:14.987 --> 37:17.694
Whoever gets closest
picks the next round.

37:17.909 --> 37:20.152
I'll even drink that
frog water of yours.

37:20.329 --> 37:23.700
You've been doing this all your life.
I've never done this.

37:24.210 --> 37:28.672
Okay. I'll throw backwards with my eyes
closed, and you can shoot straight.

37:28.883 --> 37:30.294
Oh, yeah? You will?

37:30.510 --> 37:33.181
You got yourself a deal.
Come on, watch this.

37:33.473 --> 37:36.510
Do this aerodynamic thing
that you were talking about.

37:42.903 --> 37:45.359
Okay. Okay.

37:46.408 --> 37:47.903
Here we go.

38:00.136 --> 38:01.761
Hey, Jeanie.

38:02.014 --> 38:05.181
Hey. What are you doing awake?
You need your sleep.

38:06.269 --> 38:09.889
I kept my end of the deal with surgery.
What about you?

38:10.109 --> 38:11.438
What do you mean?

38:11.819 --> 38:14.358
Blackhawks/Islanders?

38:14.573 --> 38:16.116
Right.

38:21.375 --> 38:23.119
Center ice.

38:23.294 --> 38:25.334
That is so cool.

38:25.547 --> 38:27.006
So we got a date?

38:27.466 --> 38:30.920
- Yeah. Thanks, Jeanie.
- Sure.

38:31.973 --> 38:33.682
You have a good sleep, okay?

38:33.892 --> 38:35.969
Are you leaving?

38:36.187 --> 38:38.477
Well, not if you don't want me to.

38:39.192 --> 38:42.693
It gets kind of creepy in here
at night. That's all.

38:45.325 --> 38:48.078
Why don't I just sit here
until you fall asleep?

38:48.705 --> 38:50.165
Thanks, Jeanie.

38:58.219 --> 39:00.842
- Thanks.
- Sure.

39:14.325 --> 39:16.200
These are great photos.

39:18.289 --> 39:20.082
Those are Chase Carter originals.

39:20.292 --> 39:21.408
Really?

39:22.421 --> 39:25.625
Pretty stuff.
Not what I would have expected.

39:25.925 --> 39:27.420
He's got a lot of talents.

39:31.225 --> 39:33.763
I guess that's why this
is hard to understand.

39:36.482 --> 39:39.603
Well, this happens
to all kinds of people.

39:40.989 --> 39:42.448
Yeah.

39:46.121 --> 39:50.168
When I said that I had a friend on heroin,
I wasn't being completely honest.

39:51.671 --> 39:52.703
How so?

39:56.469 --> 39:57.880
It was my boyfriend.

39:59.473 --> 40:03.306
I've done the detox dance
more times than I can count.

40:06.066 --> 40:07.976
How come you didn't cut him loose?

40:09.071 --> 40:10.981
It's not that easy
when you love someone.

40:11.866 --> 40:14.322
No. No, it's not.

40:16.039 --> 40:18.329
You think this is the worst of it?

40:18.709 --> 40:20.204
I wish.

40:20.629 --> 40:22.207
Well, you were right.

40:23.758 --> 40:25.087
I don't know what I'm doing.

40:25.803 --> 40:28.092
No. You're doing great.

40:31.394 --> 40:32.853
Thanks for coming.

40:34.774 --> 40:36.269
What are friends for?

41:18.378 --> 41:20.003
I guess they're kicking us out.

41:20.214 --> 41:21.839
Yeah. That's life.

41:22.049 --> 41:23.758
Yep, that's life!

41:28.434 --> 41:31.638
Neither one of us is in
any shape to drive.

41:31.855 --> 41:34.063
Listen, I didn't mean
to get you drunk.

41:34.275 --> 41:37.729
It's just I've never seen
that happen from two Pimm's before.

41:37.948 --> 41:39.324
Thank you!

41:44.457 --> 41:46.996
I should call us a cab.

41:51.383 --> 41:53.377
I'd invite you back to my place...

41:54.972 --> 41:57.547
...but I fear I'd be taking advantage.

42:05.487 --> 42:10.068
My head is spinning.
I should just get some sleep.

42:12.079 --> 42:13.990
It's probably best.

42:15.167 --> 42:16.828
Taxi!

42:21.510 --> 42:23.587
When you get home,
drink plenty of water.

42:23.805 --> 42:27.591
If you have any aspirin
or B-complex, all the better.

42:27.978 --> 42:31.015
- So where can I drop you?
- It's okay, I'll get my own cab.

42:31.232 --> 42:32.561
You sure?

42:40.412 --> 42:42.156
Hey, Elizabeth.

42:42.665 --> 42:43.994
I had a really good time.

42:44.167 --> 42:45.746
Yes...

42:45.920 --> 42:47.581
...it was delightful.

42:48.591 --> 42:50.833
- Good night.
- Night.

43:04.905 --> 43:06.899
I've been waiting for you all night.

43:07.075 --> 43:09.615
I'm sorry. I got wrapped up.

43:11.039 --> 43:13.246
I called here but you weren't home.

43:13.417 --> 43:15.957
I was on the corner
of Dearborn and Clark.

43:17.590 --> 43:19.050
Right.

43:19.760 --> 43:22.168
I called the hospital
and the firehouse.

43:22.389 --> 43:25.510
And they both said that Unit 57
came back on time.

43:27.688 --> 43:29.231
I was talking to Greg Powell.

43:30.400 --> 43:32.939
He was the paramedic
on my ride-along.

43:34.322 --> 43:36.862
It was a really tough day
for both of us...

43:37.577 --> 43:39.737
It's like when you start
talking to someone...

43:39.913 --> 43:42.322
...you hardly know
and you tell them things.

43:46.382 --> 43:47.841
Talking to him all night?

43:50.971 --> 43:53.974
We got coffee and we talked.
And since then I've been walking.

43:55.186 --> 43:56.562
In this cold?

44:00.109 --> 44:02.815
- I needed to think.
- About what?

44:09.331 --> 44:11.573
About you and me.

44:13.044 --> 44:16.249
And the engagement and the vows
and the rings.

44:21.932 --> 44:24.769
I think we're rushing into this.
I don't think we're ready.

44:25.271 --> 44:27.063
I'm ready.

44:28.526 --> 44:30.483
But you aren't?

44:34.367 --> 44:38.912
When I was talking to Greg Powell,
it got intense.

44:45.758 --> 44:47.669
And I kissed him.

44:50.848 --> 44:52.224
It didn't go any further.

44:52.726 --> 44:55.053
But it was one of those moments,
you know?

44:55.230 --> 44:56.891
I didn't want it to...

44:57.066 --> 44:58.230
Okay, that's good.

44:58.402 --> 45:00.893
I just wanted to make sure
you were safe and sound.

45:01.113 --> 45:03.440
Doug! I am so sorry!

45:03.741 --> 45:05.806
Yeah, me too.
