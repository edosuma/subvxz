01:17.243 --> 01:18.244
Bury this!

01:18.328 --> 01:20.163
So nobody trips on the cord.

01:27.879 --> 01:30.632
Hey, Goof! Showtime!

01:30.715 --> 01:32.801
Come on, Dad. There's gonna be

01:32.884 --> 01:35.220
a big TV news special about Pete.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.263
Our own neighbour on tellyvision?

01:37.347 --> 01:39.766
I wouldn't miss that
for all the jell-o in Java.

01:39.849 --> 01:43.186
Huh? Gawrsh!

01:43.269 --> 01:46.022
Twenty big ones! Know what this means?

01:46.106 --> 01:47.941
New skateboard, here I come.

01:48.024 --> 01:52.445
No! I gotta find
the rightful owner, and pronto!

01:52.529 --> 01:54.906
What if this belongs
to some little old lady?

01:54.989 --> 01:56.950
What if she needs it
to pay the mortgage on the--

01:57.033 --> 01:58.451
I get it, I get it.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.870
It's like I always say, Max,

02:00.954 --> 02:03.540
-honesty's the best policy.
-Honesty's the best policy.

02:03.623 --> 02:06.501
Tell Pete I'll be back
in two tics of a tac toe.

02:06.584 --> 02:08.837
He's not going to like this.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.839
Aw, shucks. He'll understand.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.092
[Pete]
He's doin' what?

02:22.892 --> 02:26.771
[gasp] Why, thanks, Goof.
You found my missin' 20.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.566
-Yours? You sure? Can you identify it?
-You betcha?

02:29.649 --> 02:31.484
Twos, zeros, a picture of Andy Jackson

02:31.568 --> 02:32.902
when he had more hair and needed glasses.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.654
You're right. Here you go.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.406
Oh, I just can't wait!

02:36.489 --> 02:39.576
I called everybody at school,
and they're all watching.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.077
[indistinct chatter]

02:41.161 --> 02:42.454
All right, all right.

02:42.537 --> 02:45.081
In 10 seconds, you are going to witness

02:45.165 --> 02:48.209
a major event in television broadcastin',

02:48.293 --> 02:51.546
a news special devoted solely to me.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.256
So sit back, relax,

02:53.340 --> 02:56.134
and try to hold the applause, hmm?

02:56.217 --> 02:59.012
Good day, Spoonerville.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.348
I'm Roland R. Havacheque,

03:01.431 --> 03:04.267
and this is a special presentation

03:04.351 --> 03:07.354
of channel one
hyperaction news!

03:07.437 --> 03:11.441
Today a startling profile
of a man called Pete,

03:11.524 --> 03:13.443
Spoonerville's leading used car dealer,

03:13.526 --> 03:16.863
as we present "Honest Pete's Used Cars:

03:16.946 --> 03:18.948
Scam or menace"?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.700
What? Pfaah!

03:20.784 --> 03:23.495
[female reporter] Is Honest Pete's just
another consumer rip-off

03:23.578 --> 03:26.873
or a menace to then entire
free enterprise system?

03:26.956 --> 03:28.708
You be the judge.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.252
Hey, look! It's Petey!

03:31.336 --> 03:33.922
[female reporter] Channel one's hidden
camera was there

03:34.005 --> 03:35.882
as Pete conned an unsuspecting customer

03:35.965 --> 03:37.926
into taking a test ride

03:38.009 --> 03:41.137
in a car specially rigged
to separate the customer

03:41.179 --> 03:43.098
from his pocket change.

03:45.475 --> 03:46.559
Heh-heh-heh.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.478
Sucker!

03:48.561 --> 03:51.815
Now, now, don't go jumpin' to contusions.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.150
Haven't you ever heard of finders keepers?

03:54.234 --> 03:57.487
[muttering]

03:57.570 --> 03:59.406
Even after the deal's made,

03:59.489 --> 04:03.618
it's never too late for Honest Pete
to pull the old switcheroo.

04:03.702 --> 04:04.953
Aah!

04:05.036 --> 04:07.038
Get that remote control, quick!

04:07.122 --> 04:09.958
Ah-hyuck! He's a regular TV star.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.460
And to think we knew him when.

04:12.544 --> 04:15.338
Yeah. Before the tar and feathers.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.882
My wives of hopeless husbands group

04:17.966 --> 04:19.801
is getting an earful this week.

04:19.884 --> 04:22.679
But, honey mustard, this is business.

04:22.762 --> 04:26.224
Everybody knows
when their back's turned, anything goes.

04:26.307 --> 04:29.561
Mommy, can P.J. phone the FBI now?

04:29.644 --> 04:32.647
Later, we talked to the chief of police.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.067
These abuses must cease.

04:36.151 --> 04:40.238
Any more shady shenanigans,
and honest Pete's gonna be jailbird Pete!

04:40.321 --> 04:41.573
[siren wailing]

04:41.656 --> 04:43.283
They're coming to get me!

04:43.366 --> 04:44.743
Don't let 'em get me, Goof!

04:44.826 --> 04:46.745
We're best pals! Bosom buddies!

04:46.828 --> 04:47.996
You gotta help me!

04:48.079 --> 04:49.080
[knock on door]

04:49.873 --> 04:51.666
There he is!

04:51.750 --> 04:53.585
Eee!

04:53.668 --> 04:56.921
I've been looking for you...

04:57.005 --> 04:59.466
Mr Goof.

04:59.966 --> 05:00.800
Me?

05:00.884 --> 05:03.386
Your posters for that $20 bill

05:03.470 --> 05:06.514
are a shining example
to everyone outside of politics.

05:06.598 --> 05:09.100
Therefore, as mayor of our fair city,

05:09.184 --> 05:11.436
I'm pleased to proclaim you

05:11.519 --> 05:14.105
the most honest man in Spoonerville.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.983
Gawrsh!

05:17.067 --> 05:19.069
All right, dad!

05:19.152 --> 05:21.863
And at note, I'm happy to announce

05:21.946 --> 05:24.324
the most honest man in Spoonerville

05:24.407 --> 05:28.036
has just been made custodian
of customer contentment

05:28.119 --> 05:30.580
at Honest Pete's Used Cars.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.082
I have?

05:32.332 --> 05:34.376
That's Honest Pete's Used Cars,

05:34.417 --> 05:38.213
open seven days a week
at the sign of the big smilin' Pete,

05:38.296 --> 05:41.216
where no deal's too small
and no price is to high

05:41.299 --> 05:44.552
for you, the car-buyin' public.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.263
And remember,

05:47.347 --> 05:51.101
one double-dealing dirty trick,
and it's off to the hoosegow.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.645
Yes, your chieftanship.

05:53.728 --> 05:57.190
Well, I must say I never thought
I'd buy a car from honest Pete's,

05:57.273 --> 06:01.528
but if one can't trust the most honest man
in Spoonerville, then who?

06:01.611 --> 06:04.614
[Goofy]
Honesty is our policy.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.284
Heh-heh. It's working already.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.537
Hmm... I don't know.

06:10.620 --> 06:14.958
$5,000 seems on the steep side.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.209
Sure does.

06:16.292 --> 06:19.921
Can't worth more than, oh, 12 bucks.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.924
-Sold!
-What?

06:23.008 --> 06:24.509
That heap cost me a buck 50!

06:24.592 --> 06:26.094
[grumbling]

06:26.177 --> 06:27.178
Going somewhere, Pete?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.473
Heh-heh-heh.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.475
Just going to congratulate
my new associate

06:32.559 --> 06:35.061
on his very first sale.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.646
Heh-heh-heh.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.983
Congratulations, Pal.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.401
Thank you kindly, Pete.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.904
Here you go. Two 5s and a 2.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.406
Hee-hee-hee-hee!

06:46.489 --> 06:48.491
That's... swell.

06:51.202 --> 06:54.914
Hmm... bent axle, holes in the gas tank...

06:54.998 --> 06:57.459
I know it isn't much of a car,

06:57.542 --> 07:00.128
but if I could get
a few dollars for it...

07:02.380 --> 07:05.133
Well, I guess I could give you
2 bucks for it.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.969
Oh, that would be wonderful.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.681
Since my Henry passed on,

07:11.765 --> 07:14.351
it's been so hard to make ends meet.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.020
I've sold practically everything--

07:17.103 --> 07:19.689
my furniture, the wallpaper.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.360
I had to put the goldfish up for adoption.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.154
I couldn't afford to change the water

07:26.237 --> 07:28.281
in his little bowl.

07:29.491 --> 07:30.784
Gawrsh.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.622
Here. Here's 500 bucks.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.041
Oh, thank you!

07:39.793 --> 07:41.002
Close enough.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.088
Of course it will be hard

07:43.171 --> 07:46.716
to get to the senior centre
now that the car is gone,

07:46.800 --> 07:49.177
but I suppose I'm too old

07:49.260 --> 07:51.680
and too poor to have fun anymore.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.724
Gawrsh. Everybody ought
to have a little fun

07:54.808 --> 07:57.727
once in a while.
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.021
I can throw in some kind of vehicle

08:00.105 --> 08:01.523
to help get you by.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.533
[neigh]

08:14.035 --> 08:16.454
Not the Fellini deluxe!

08:22.377 --> 08:24.421
Honesty is our policy.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.923
Can't be worth more than 12 bucks.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.676
I've got to find the rightful owner.

08:29.759 --> 08:30.927
That's a promise.

08:31.011 --> 08:35.223
I-- d-- what-- aah!

08:37.684 --> 08:39.519
[Goofy] What a day! Ah-hyuck!

08:39.602 --> 08:42.063
Sold 114 cars!

08:42.147 --> 08:45.900
Here you go, Petey. $39.18.

08:45.984 --> 08:49.320
Proof positive that honesty pays.

08:49.404 --> 08:52.824
Pete, so long as the most honest man
in Spoonerville

08:52.907 --> 08:55.952
is on the job, you're off the hook.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.371
See you bright and early tomorrow, Petey.

08:59.706 --> 09:03.043
I never shoulda left the Army!

09:03.126 --> 09:04.669
Waah!

09:06.463 --> 09:08.340
[Pete]
Hyuk, hyuk, hyuk.

09:08.423 --> 09:12.677
Dis car? Gawrsh!
Dis car's only worth $1.09.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.889
Oops! Forgot that spot of rust.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.641
Hyuk! $1.02.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.561
And gawrsh! Oh, gawrsh!

09:21.644 --> 09:25.815
Don't forget this bag of money
you left in the back seat.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.533
"The helmet of blind obedience

09:35.617 --> 09:38.536
makes any mutt your slave?"

09:42.832 --> 09:45.669
Heh-heh. Ain't life grand?

09:47.504 --> 09:51.341
Goof, old buddy, old pal,
you've done so well

09:51.424 --> 09:54.552
that for the next hour you get to wear

09:54.636 --> 09:58.014
the official crown of sales distinction.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.766
Gawrsh. Thanks, Petey.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.601
Well, gosh, oh, golly.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.687
Would you look at that?

10:03.770 --> 10:05.522
Tsk, tsk.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.149
Some poor citizen left his wallet

10:08.233 --> 10:09.609
in one of our cars.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.611
Whatever shall we do?

10:11.695 --> 10:13.029
We got to find the owner!

10:13.113 --> 10:15.865
Like I always say, honesty is the best...

10:15.949 --> 10:19.619
Finders keepers!

10:19.703 --> 10:23.456
Finders keepers!

10:23.540 --> 10:26.543
Finders keepers.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.590
I'm in love!

10:32.674 --> 10:35.468
$100,000?

10:35.552 --> 10:37.512
What makes it worth that much?

10:37.595 --> 10:41.141
Got me. Truth is this clunker's
only worth--

10:41.224 --> 10:44.144
a fib's worth 1,000 facts.

10:44.227 --> 10:47.731
A fib's worth 1,000 facts.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.899
Worth 200,000.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.902
After all, that's what we gave Elvis

10:52.986 --> 10:53.987
when he traded it in.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.156
Elvis' car?

10:56.906 --> 10:58.283
I'll take it.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.661
Congratulations, sir.
You made a wise purchase.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.497
Now go out there
and command the road.

11:04.581 --> 11:08.460
When their back is turned, anything goes.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.096
Nice job, Goof!

11:20.180 --> 11:21.514
Thanks, Pete.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.558
Hey, somebody dropped a penny.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.020
Well, look at that.
Now what do we do?

11:45.872 --> 11:47.791
When their back is turned,

11:47.874 --> 11:51.044
anything goes, goes, goes...

11:52.629 --> 11:55.840
All been sold out,
and it isn't even noon!

11:55.924 --> 11:58.093
Ha-ha! What sucker would suspect

11:58.176 --> 12:01.680
the most honest man
in Spoonerville been rippin 'em off?

12:02.889 --> 12:04.140
Here's all the stuff

12:04.224 --> 12:05.892
folks dropped in the car, Petey.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.644
Leave it on the desk.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.812
Nuh-uh.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.480
What do you mean, nuh-uh?

12:10.563 --> 12:12.023

12:13.566 --> 12:16.653
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
You found, I keep.

12:16.736 --> 12:20.323
That loot was on my lot,
so it's mine, see?

12:20.407 --> 12:22.492
Sorry. I found it, I'm keepin' it.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.285
I don't even want it,

12:24.369 --> 12:25.995
but for some reason
I can't to give it up.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.331
Oh, I'll give you a reason!

12:28.415 --> 12:30.083
You got just two seconds--

12:30.166 --> 12:32.210
well, lookie what else I found.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.713

12:34.796 --> 12:36.631
Gimme that! It's mine!

12:36.715 --> 12:38.800
Well, this is nice.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.468

12:40.552 --> 12:42.053
Look at this and this--

12:42.137 --> 12:45.181

12:45.265 --> 12:47.183
This is nice. Lookie here.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.019

12:49.102 --> 12:52.522
Oh, lookie! Found this and this and this!

12:52.605 --> 12:53.606
Stop that!

12:53.690 --> 12:55.775
OK, OK!

12:55.859 --> 12:57.110
You win.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.279
Take it, you--
just leave me--

13:01.573 --> 13:03.408

13:03.491 --> 13:05.994

13:28.933 --> 13:30.310
That's right, Edna.

13:30.393 --> 13:31.895
It's pink, of course.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.105
And it may be my imagination,

13:34.189 --> 13:38.693
but I swear there was sweat
on the steering wheel.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.949
And then I found a white thread
on the driver's--

13:45.033 --> 13:45.867
Aah!

13:45.950 --> 13:47.911
[humming]

13:54.417 --> 13:56.628
That's all I need.
Try to make a dishonest living.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.838
Next thing I know,
I've gone and invented Goofenstein!

13:58.922 --> 14:01.257
[muttering]

14:02.592 --> 14:04.761
Stop the Goof. Oh!

14:04.844 --> 14:08.640
Snookums! I take back most
of the things I said about you

14:08.723 --> 14:10.475
because the paper is just full

14:10.558 --> 14:13.061
of how Goofy's put the honesty
back in honest Pete's.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.146
And I'm so proud of you that I can--

14:15.230 --> 14:16.731
punkin seed, I hate to get personal

14:16.815 --> 14:18.024
during your lunch hour,

14:18.108 --> 14:19.984
but why aren't you wearing any pants?

14:32.122 --> 14:35.542
Well, now let's see the Goof swipe this.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.630
Hiya, Petey. Ah-hyuck!

14:40.714 --> 14:42.298
Where did these cars come from!

14:42.382 --> 14:44.843
Well, that one was parked
in front of city hall,

14:44.926 --> 14:47.137
that one was in back
of the police station,

14:47.220 --> 14:49.139
that one was just sitting
in front of the bank

14:49.222 --> 14:50.348
with the engine running.

14:50.432 --> 14:53.309
Just all sort of sitting
there, and I thought...

14:53.435 --> 14:55.770
Well, finders keepers.

14:55.854 --> 14:58.606
You didn't. You didn't.

14:58.690 --> 14:59.941
You did.

15:00.692 --> 15:03.361
But nobody will believe
the most honest man in Spoonerville

15:03.445 --> 15:05.780
is a car thief. They'll blame me!

15:05.864 --> 15:08.199
We gotta put 'em all back before-- aah!

15:13.079 --> 15:15.498
Sorry! Can't let anybody on the lot!

15:15.582 --> 15:17.250
Got a big oil spill. Very slippery.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.711
Oh. Did I mention plague?
Yeah, tse tse flies.

15:19.794 --> 15:20.920
Heebie-jeebies, runny noses, horrible.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.172
You don't want to be here.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.632
Yes, I do.

15:25.216 --> 15:28.094
What's my patrol car doing here?

15:28.178 --> 15:30.430
[Pete]
Your car? Here? Gee--

15:30.513 --> 15:33.683
I-- I can explain. It's here...

15:33.767 --> 15:36.269
Here for a free oil change.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.689
Yeah. Well, I'll just check
that statement out

15:39.773 --> 15:41.941
with the most honest man in Spoonerville.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.651
Is that right, Goof?

15:44.277 --> 15:45.570
Well...

15:45.653 --> 15:49.115
A fib's worth 1,000 facts.

15:49.199 --> 15:51.951
Well, Chief, Pete's not
exactly tellin' the truth.

15:52.535 --> 15:53.870
Ah-ha!

15:53.953 --> 15:56.122
It's really here for an oil change,

15:56.206 --> 15:58.875
free set of plugs, and a free wash.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.169
Free plugs? A wash, you say?

16:01.252 --> 16:04.172
Well, OK, but make it snappy.

16:04.255 --> 16:07.342
Whew! Yes, sir, your chiefologist.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.012
O.K., Petey, don't panic.

16:11.096 --> 16:13.932
Quick oil change and a wash,
and he's out of here.

16:14.057 --> 16:15.225

16:15.308 --> 16:18.812

16:29.989 --> 16:31.825
Polishin' it for you, Chiefy.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.494
Never mind that. Finish my car.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.246
Yes, Sir!

16:36.329 --> 16:39.749

16:49.509 --> 16:51.136
They're mine. They're not yours!
