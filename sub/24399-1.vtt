01:26.080 --> 01:27.308
Ready?

01:28.240 --> 01:30.879
Now!

01:31.200 --> 01:33.839
Ew!
It's a perfect likeness.

01:34.280 --> 01:35.679
Ofwho?

01:35.680 --> 01:38.592
Her name's hard
to pronounce.

01:38.600 --> 01:42.559
You see, on her planet,
theirvocal chords
are in the tentacles,

01:43.800 --> 01:45.438
but it sounds
a little like...

01:50.760 --> 01:53.513
Art, we're getting them
all worked up before bed.

01:53.520 --> 01:56.159
It really is time to sleep.
There‘s no time to sleep.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.310
It's very important
that we make this movie.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.035
You know why?
Why?

02:01.040 --> 02:03.429
Because the world
needs to know

02:03.720 --> 02:08.350
that aliens walk among us.
and they look like...

02:12.080 --> 02:14.913
Gotcha!
Look, Mom's right,
all right?

02:14.920 --> 02:16.353
Enough movie magic
for tonight.

02:16.600 --> 02:17.953
Come on.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.029
Come here, bud.

02:19.040 --> 02:22.157
Time for all
our little aliens to get
into their space pajamas,

02:22.160 --> 02:23.639
and brush theirteeth...

02:23.640 --> 02:28.430
With some
Venusian tooth goopl

02:29.720 --> 02:32.188
Yay! Goopl
Yeah!

02:33.840 --> 02:35.068
All right.
All right.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.957
- Night, buds.
- Come on.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.439
All right, night,
sweetheart. Love you.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.032
Love you.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.472
Okay, let's go.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.835
We're gonna be first.
Come on, let's go.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.319
Hey, Dad.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.798
She looks so real.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.518
Well, why not?

02:53.680 --> 02:56.638
Astronomers think
there could be billions
more planets like Earth

02:56.640 --> 02:58.551
in our galaxy alone.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.869
They can't all just
be empty balls of rock.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.159
What was that?

03:06.280 --> 03:07.349
Dad?

03:15.040 --> 03:17.190
| just remembered
something only I can do.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.268
Everything's gonna
be all right.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.349
Owl

03:25.960 --> 03:29.635
I'll come back, Rod.
I promise.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.758
Dad?

03:43.320 --> 03:45.959
Dad!

03:47.960 --> 03:49.871
(snoursi Dad!

05:14.000 --> 05:19.233
Hey, he's coming! Rod! Rod!
Rod, Rod, come on,
turn around! Rod! Rod!

05:19.480 --> 05:21.311
Billy.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.596
Hello, Pudge-Boy...

05:24.880 --> 05:26.393
No, no!

05:28.000 --> 05:29.069
Fabulous.

05:30.520 --> 05:31.839
0h!

05:37.800 --> 05:41.588
Twenty-three. Yeah.

05:42.840 --> 05:46.310
Sorry. Wipe?

05:46.320 --> 05:47.992
Of all the kids
in sixth grade,

05:48.000 --> 05:49.718
why does Billy Becker
got to pick on me?

05:49.720 --> 05:50.994
You know how it is.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.231
Some people collect stamps,
or comic books...

05:54.240 --> 05:56.435
It's his hobby?

05:56.440 --> 05:58.158
He's the official
class bully.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.037
You need
to stay out of sight
till he forgets you.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.909
But then he'll just
bug some other kid.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.592
There's got to be
a better way.

06:04.600 --> 06:07.717
Yeah. Well, how about this?
School's almost over.

06:07.720 --> 06:11.508
Couple more days,
no more homework,
and no more Billy Becker.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.432
Just two whole weeks of fun
and excitement, and...

06:14.440 --> 06:16.032
And fun and excitement.

06:16.680 --> 06:20.070
Like anything fun
or exciting ever happens
around here.

06:33.680 --> 06:36.114
What‘s up with
the freaky snow?
I know.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.872
It's like the school's
a giant snow magnet,

06:37.880 --> 06:39.359
pulling it in
from everywhere else.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.429
That sucks.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.477
We need itto snow
everywhere, so, we can
finally get a snow day.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.198
No, snow week!

06:45.200 --> 06:46.315
Snow year!

06:46.320 --> 06:47.912
Yeah!

06:47.920 --> 06:50.434
Well, see you
tomorrow, Rod.
Okay. See you, Mickey.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.796
See ya!

06:52.800 --> 06:56.156
In local weather, an extremely
localized snowfall...

06:58.800 --> 06:59.869
Eh...

07:07.160 --> 07:08.559
Eh...

07:16.560 --> 07:18.516
Elspeth?
What are you doing here?

07:18.520 --> 07:19.748
Rod!

07:19.760 --> 07:22.354
Mom?
My office. Now.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.317
Rod, yourAunt Grace
and Uncle Roger

07:30.320 --> 07:31.992
are just having
a few problems,

07:32.000 --> 07:33.752
and they need to get away.

07:33.760 --> 07:36.228
Lf Elspeth was my kid,
I'd need to get away, too.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.389
Rod!

07:37.400 --> 07:39.231
How long
will she be here?

07:39.240 --> 07:43.153
Your cousin will
be staying with us
for winter break.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.275
Great.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.397
Her parents are
having problems,
so my break's ruined?

07:47.400 --> 07:49.868
Oh, Roddie,
not everything
is about you.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.757
Look, I need to work.
Get out of my chair.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.955
Go do your homework,
or something, okay?

08:05.480 --> 08:08.790
No luck with
the diet, huh?
Eat a bug.

08:08.800 --> 08:09.949
You did that on purpose.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.110
Rod, Elspeth and I
are going to the mall.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.951
You're in charge
until I get back.

08:13.960 --> 08:17.270
Mom, no.
I have to finish
my science fair project.

08:18.240 --> 08:21.471
Well, you've got
two eager helpers
upstairs. Bye.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.717
Cold, but I like it.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.236
Don't tell Rod.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.190
It's almost done.
Just hold still.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.839
I really want you
to play with us, Rod.
Please?

08:50.200 --> 08:52.395
It's gonna
look awesome.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.549
Huh?

09:18.680 --> 09:20.159
Again! Again! Again!

09:20.160 --> 09:21.593
Again!

09:59.840 --> 10:04.516
One more move, Earthling,
and l ventilate your skull!

10:09.400 --> 10:11.630
So, after they got
the rabbit out of the tree,

10:11.640 --> 10:14.029
they said I didn't
have to look after
the classroom pet anymore,

10:14.040 --> 10:17.191
which is too bad
because I really thought
that parachute was gonna work.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.679
Because it did
with the turtle.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.159
Well, two times
out of the three.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.469
Who are you?

10:22.480 --> 10:27.554
Captain Grakker
of the Galactic Patrol,
commander of this mission.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.033
What mission?

10:30.240 --> 10:31.389
Oh.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.551
Saving this
miserable backward world

10:34.560 --> 10:37.518
from total
planetary disaster!

10:37.520 --> 10:41.638
But first,
I have to deal with
an unexpected setback.

10:41.640 --> 10:45.155
Wait. Go back
to the part about
total planetary disaster.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.628
Your assistance is required.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.031
Therefore, in accordance with

10:50.040 --> 10:54.636
Provision 13.4.7.6 of
the Galactic Legal Code,

10:54.640 --> 10:57.393
you are now my deputy.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.914
Say what?
Request denied!

11:00.120 --> 11:02.714
He's mean, Roddie.
Make him go away.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.836
Silence, grubling!

11:05.280 --> 11:08.636
He's funny!
Iwanna play with him.
Back!

11:08.640 --> 11:10.596
Linda, don't!
Back, larva! Back!

11:12.400 --> 11:15.119
You're a bad toy! Bad!

11:15.440 --> 11:18.113
Nobody ray-guns
my little sister!

11:18.360 --> 11:19.429
Oh, yeah?

11:19.440 --> 11:23.399
Well, to that, I say,
boogers!

11:23.400 --> 11:24.469
What?

11:24.480 --> 11:27.756
- Captain Grakker!
- Desist at once!

11:29.440 --> 11:32.591
You really should
have let me exit first.

11:32.600 --> 11:33.715
But...

11:33.720 --> 11:36.837
Running off
without the proper
behavior module...

11:37.040 --> 11:39.838
Let me change it foryou.

12:01.720 --> 12:05.633
Oh. Well, hello there,
young Earthlings.

12:05.640 --> 12:09.394
Pretty swell planet
you got here.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.515
Yup.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.239
Allow me
to introduce myself,

12:13.240 --> 12:16.471
as I should have done
in the first place.
0h.

12:16.480 --> 12:22.430
lam Madame Pong,
Diplomatic Officer
of the Starship Ferkel.

12:23.760 --> 12:26.957
Starship. Cool.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.233
I don't know how,
and they couldn't
let go of their ladder.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.038
So, I thought
they were gonna be
stuck up there for good,

12:34.040 --> 12:35.996
and lwas gonna be
on that roof forever.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.431
You know, I think
Rod had a bad day
at school today.

12:40.880 --> 12:44.668
It's okay, Aunt Gwen.
I understand.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.353
After all, he's only 12.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.074
So are you, my dear.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.952
I think I got it.

12:54.960 --> 12:57.349
First, you don't want me
to take you to my leader.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.509
Gracious, no!

12:58.520 --> 13:00.431
It's essential
you keep the secret

13:00.440 --> 13:02.795
of our existence from
your world's primiti...

13:04.000 --> 13:07.515
I mean,
emerging civilization.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.636
If you do spill our beans,

13:09.640 --> 13:11.790
lam authorized
to fry your brains

13:11.800 --> 13:13.711
and the brains of
anyone else you tell.

13:13.720 --> 13:14.789
What?

13:18.120 --> 13:22.079
So, the policewomen
were very understanding,
but the firefighters weren't,

13:22.080 --> 13:25.390
because the Krazy Glue | used
to attach my suction cups

13:25.400 --> 13:26.913
somehow got everywhere.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.712
But it's okay
I know about you

13:36.720 --> 13:39.075
because you need my help
to hide yourship

13:39.080 --> 13:41.275
until you fix
the whatcha-ma-thingy

13:41.280 --> 13:43.475
that will change it back
to its usual size.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.153
"Embiggen it,"
as you Earthlings say.

13:46.320 --> 13:47.435
Hmm.

13:47.440 --> 13:48.998
No, we don't.

13:49.280 --> 13:50.474
What happened
to the third turtle?

13:50.480 --> 13:52.869
Yeah,
you don't want to know.
No, ldon't want to know.

13:52.880 --> 13:53.869
They're home!

13:54.160 --> 13:56.310
Listen, I'll help you
hide your ship,

13:56.320 --> 13:58.197
but first, you've
gotta help me, fast!

13:59.600 --> 14:01.830
Hello! We're back!

14:03.200 --> 14:06.237
What kind of science project
is Rod building upthere?

14:06.240 --> 14:07.593
It shouldn't sound
like that.

14:11.400 --> 14:14.472
I almost won my school's
science fair project
this year, Aunt Gwen.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.392
Almost?
I made a really sharp
set of parabolic wings.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.791
Apparently, being pulled
behind a moving car
while on a skateboard

14:27.800 --> 14:28.994
is too dangerous,
or something.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.676
Knock, knock.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.877
What was all that
thumping and bumping?

14:34.880 --> 14:36.279
Just cleaning up.

14:36.760 --> 14:39.797
Well, I can see that.
How unusual.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.870
The little aliens
helped us!

14:41.880 --> 14:43.279
'Cause we're
helping them!

14:43.280 --> 14:44.633
Well, that's nice of you.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.756
We had to 'cause
they have ray-guns.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.273
And they'll fry
our brains!

14:48.280 --> 14:49.793
Pew, pew!

14:53.640 --> 14:55.312
Ah!

14:55.320 --> 14:58.153
Clever cleaning game,
big brother.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.709
Is it okay if I go
to Seldom Seen?

15:00.720 --> 15:02.950
Sure, just be back
in time for dinner, okay?

15:03.840 --> 15:07.469
Eric, Linda, why don't
we all get cleaned up
before dinner, hmm?

15:07.680 --> 15:10.274
Elspeth, why don't you
go out with Rod?

15:10.280 --> 15:12.157
I'd rather help you,
Aunt Gwen.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.079
Thanks, Mom!
Won't be late!

15:15.640 --> 15:18.632
Okay. Hey, you two,
don't touch the walls
with that stuff!

15:26.760 --> 15:27.829
What?

15:31.040 --> 15:34.157
You're hiding something.
I'll find it.

15:55.040 --> 15:58.157
My grandpa built
our house on what used to be
a part of his farm.

15:58.160 --> 16:01.357
There are lots of woods,
even a swamp
if you go far enough.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.351
And when you go
even further,

16:03.360 --> 16:06.033
you finally come up
on this wide-open field

16:06.040 --> 16:08.031
that my grandpa
calls "Seldom Seen."

16:09.800 --> 16:13.110
Grandpa calls it that
because no one ever
comes here, except my family.

16:16.440 --> 16:17.634
Whoa!

16:17.640 --> 16:21.792
Probably because
we're the only ones
who don't believe

16:21.800 --> 16:23.791
all the stories about
all the strange stuff

16:23.800 --> 16:25.199
that's supposed
to happen here,

16:25.200 --> 16:27.316
like strange lights,
or blizzards in July.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.151
I've been coming here
all my life,

16:29.160 --> 16:31.674
and I've never seen
anything strange happen,

16:31.680 --> 16:33.318
until now.

16:33.320 --> 16:36.392
Time to change
your settings, Captain.
We have work to do.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.879
Ahh.

16:43.360 --> 16:44.588
Will that be enough room?

16:44.600 --> 16:48.388
For the Ferkel, yes,
but we must move back
a safe distance.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.516
Activate the embiggener.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.229
Who's she talking to?

16:57.240 --> 16:58.958
That's classified.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.834
Boogers, boogers!
Boogers-boogers-boogers!

17:16.839 --> 17:18.558
What is it with you
and "boogers"?

17:19.599 --> 17:21.431
Is that not
an appropriate expression

17:21.440 --> 17:24.352
of righteous warrior rage
and frustration on yourworld?

17:24.359 --> 17:26.510
Maybe, if you're five.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.271
How about fart burps?

17:28.280 --> 17:31.158
Where exactly
did you learn our language?

17:36.960 --> 17:38.871
Boogers.

17:39.120 --> 17:41.190
Local weather is very much
in the news today,

17:41.200 --> 17:44.112
as another occurrence
of a site-specific
snow storm...

17:44.120 --> 17:45.189
Here we go.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.709
All set.

17:47.720 --> 17:50.996
...Say they have to go
back almost 15 years
to find records...

17:51.000 --> 17:53.594
My mom says
Uncle Art was rotten
to run away

17:53.600 --> 17:55.750
and leave you like he did.

17:57.480 --> 18:00.199
He wouldn't have left
unless he had to,

18:00.840 --> 18:04.276
He told Rod
he'd be back,
and your Uncle Art,

18:04.280 --> 18:06.953
he never lies.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.155
Grown-ups have
a lot of secrets.

18:09.160 --> 18:13.438
My mom and dad, they think
I don't know what's
going on, but I do.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.837
Listen,
dinner's on the table
in 15 minutes, okay?

18:18.840 --> 18:20.592
Why don't
you go tell Rod?

18:28.400 --> 18:30.038
Lcan't
hide you guys forever.

18:30.040 --> 18:32.110
How long will it take you
to repairyour ship?

18:33.080 --> 18:35.913
Let me guess,
it's classified.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.356
What you said.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.479
May I come in?
No, don't!

18:41.480 --> 18:43.789
Oh. Sorry.
What's this stuff?

18:45.280 --> 18:47.191
lwas making
a movie with my dad.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.191
Sci-fi, obviously.

18:50.240 --> 18:53.789
My dad said it was
more like a documentary.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.632
Do you like Star Wars?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.198
Star Trek.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.960
We need to talk.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.313
Is that your famous
science project?
No.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.675
That's not how
you spell "Vesuvius."

19:14.680 --> 19:16.352
That's how I spell it.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.355
Your mom says
dinner's almost ready.
Don't be late.

19:22.360 --> 19:23.873
Okay. You can go, now.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.192
I'll let her know
you're busy playing
with your dolls.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.519
They're action figures.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.274
Whatever you need
to tell yourself, Roddie.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.395
Hey! New rules.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.233
No ray-gunning at anybody,
not even Elspeth.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.355
Agreed.

19:43.360 --> 19:46.352
Well, we have
new rules, too.

19:46.360 --> 19:49.989
Prepare to hear them,
and obey.

19:51.800 --> 19:55.270
He's doing doll voices.
Boys are so pathetic.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.430
I can't leave
the house by myself?

19:57.440 --> 19:59.749
You have to come
with me wherever I go?

19:59.760 --> 20:01.113
Why?

20:01.120 --> 20:04.317
Despite Captain Grakker's
previous warnings,

20:04.320 --> 20:07.596
we're still concerned
you might feel it necessary

20:07.600 --> 20:10.433
to alert our presence
to your government.

20:10.440 --> 20:14.069
So? Most people think
aliens are somewhere
out there, anyway.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.549
My dad did.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.110
That's only
because your dad is a...

20:19.120 --> 20:21.156
Zip it.
Fine.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.918
Oops. Loose module.

20:24.920 --> 20:27.957
Okay, okay.
I promise not
to tell a word,

20:27.960 --> 20:31.077
but I still have
a ton of homework to do
before tomorrow,

20:31.080 --> 20:34.356
and ifyou both
come with me, then who's
gonna fix your ship?

20:34.360 --> 20:36.157
The rest of the crew.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.230
The rest of the... Who?

20:39.440 --> 20:41.670
Greetings upon you,
Earth child.

20:41.680 --> 20:45.958
lam Tar Gibbons,
Ship's Master of
Warrior Science.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.952
Greetings back
upon you, Tar?

20:48.960 --> 20:52.748
"Tar" isn't a name.
It's a title, like "Mister,"
or "Doctor,"

20:52.760 --> 20:56.036
though, yourworld
has no exact equivalent.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.713
Lnexactly,
it would be something like

20:58.720 --> 21:00.756
"Wise and beloved warrior,

21:00.760 --> 21:04.275
"who could kill me
with his little finger,
if he should so desire."

21:05.000 --> 21:05.989
Good to know.

21:07.040 --> 21:11.238
And I am the one, the only
Phillogenous esk Piemondum.

21:11.480 --> 21:16.031
Ship's Pilot and
Communications Officer,
but you can call me Phil.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.918
How can you talk?
You're a plant.

21:18.920 --> 21:22.276
I am? No wonder
I feel soiled.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.952
Ooh. Good one.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.190
How many dolls
does he have in there?

21:26.200 --> 21:28.760
Can someone
get that, please?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.353
I will, Aunt Gwen!

21:35.400 --> 21:37.277
Who are you?
Who are you?

21:37.280 --> 21:38.872
Mickey. I'm a friend
of Rod's.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.394
He has friends?

21:41.200 --> 21:43.919
Anyway, can you just tell him
I got something to show him
on the porch?

21:43.920 --> 21:45.512
Go up and tell him yourself.

21:45.720 --> 21:48.837
No can do.
This is gonna get messy.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.195
A moment,
my Captain,

21:54.200 --> 21:56.430
but I don't believe
the flarving valve
goes there.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.914
Goes there now.

22:02.920 --> 22:06.117
Might that not
destroy all Iifeforms
within 50 kreltins?

22:06.120 --> 22:08.793
Well, animal life, sure.
What's your point?

22:09.880 --> 22:11.598
May I come in?
Busy.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.158
There's a Mickey
on the porch.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.991
He's got something
he wants you to see.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.274
Be right down!

22:17.440 --> 22:19.317
Whatever.
I'll be in the kitchen.

22:32.400 --> 22:36.632
And no energy-inversion
life-destroying stuff
while I'm gone.

22:36.640 --> 22:38.358
Aw. He's no fun.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.433
Perfect timing!

23:01.440 --> 23:03.556
I know! Just wait
'til you see this!

23:03.560 --> 23:05.551
I got your
volcano problem solved!

23:05.560 --> 23:08.393
Wait. I have something
huge to tell you first.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.277
About that girl?
Who is she, anyway?

23:10.280 --> 23:13.192
Mickey.
I have aliens in my room.

23:13.200 --> 23:15.111
She doesn't look
like an alien.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.350
Not Elspeth.
She's my cousin.

23:17.360 --> 23:19.590
But! have real aliens,

23:19.600 --> 23:23.070
and they crashed
through my window
with their spaceship,

23:23.080 --> 23:25.310
and they're really small,
and they need my help,

23:25.320 --> 23:27.311
but you can't tell anybody,

23:27.320 --> 23:30.357
because if they
knew I told you,
they'd kill me.

23:30.360 --> 23:31.873
They have ray-guns.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.350
Mickey, come on.
You know! never lie.

23:34.360 --> 23:35.588
Yeah.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.398
So, that means
I'm telling...

23:38.400 --> 23:40.356
Setting me up!
...the truth!

23:40.720 --> 23:42.756
Mickey...
Getting back
to planet Earth.

23:44.960 --> 23:47.713
Doing a volcano
with baking soda and vinegar

23:47.720 --> 23:49.915
is, like, so old-timey,

23:52.760 --> 23:56.309
but this is cutting-edge.

23:56.320 --> 24:00.359
Ingredient X,
my latest invention.
Here, hold this.

24:03.240 --> 24:06.152
Now, this is a safety pin.
It's really important.

24:06.160 --> 24:09.152
It's really Important
that you don't
accidentally pull this out,

24:09.160 --> 24:11.071
and then hit this lever.

24:15.480 --> 24:16.595
Hit the deck!

24:36.840 --> 24:37.875
Whoa.

24:38.800 --> 24:43.555
Uh... So, gotta...
You know, dinner.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.599
B e!
y

24:49.600 --> 24:54.469
Well, that sucks,
but I can fix it.

24:59.880 --> 25:00.915
Where's Elspeth?

25:01.360 --> 25:04.158
lthought she was
upstairs with you.
Can you go get her?

25:09.720 --> 25:10.835
Hey!

25:10.840 --> 25:12.717
The papier-maché is
off limits to aliens!

25:12.720 --> 25:14.517
You're the alien
on this crew, buddy.

25:14.520 --> 25:16.556
This structure's
simple molecular composition

25:16.560 --> 25:19.313
makes it very suitable
for rapid energy conversion.

25:19.320 --> 25:23.313
I don't care if
it's vitamin-filled.
I need to take this to school.

25:23.320 --> 25:26.676
Rod, there is much
more at stake here
than just your volcano.

25:26.680 --> 25:28.636
Really? Like...

25:30.640 --> 25:32.119
What was that?

25:32.120 --> 25:35.237
Some rude bud-plucker
stumbled in
without an invite.

25:35.240 --> 25:39.836
I'll set up the brain-wiper
to erase its mind,
assuming it's got one.

25:45.240 --> 25:48.516
Did you really have
to do whatever this is?
What?

25:48.520 --> 25:50.954
Would you have preferred
total disintegration?

25:51.160 --> 25:54.072
Ooh. That's my favorite.
A little...
Problem solved.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.833
You need
to unfreeze her.
Now!

25:56.840 --> 25:59.149
Will you vouch
for her cooperation?

25:59.160 --> 26:00.593
Cooperation?

26:00.600 --> 26:04.115
Look, okay,
so they're aliens,

26:04.120 --> 26:05.599
but they need a place
to repairtheir ship,

26:05.600 --> 26:07.192
and can't let anyone
know that they're here.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.918
So, they came
to me for help.

26:08.920 --> 26:09.955
You?

26:10.720 --> 26:14.872
lfyou promise
not to tell anyone,
they'll let you go.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.474
Okay?
Okay, okay!

26:18.160 --> 26:19.832
Agreed?
Agreed.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.991
Captain Grakker,
reverse the polarity.

26:26.080 --> 26:30.278
Don't do anything stupid!
Me? How about them?

26:30.680 --> 26:34.639
They're way ahead of us,
Elspeth. They flew here
in a starship.

26:36.560 --> 26:39.074
If you're so smart,
why'd you ask Rod
to help you,

26:39.080 --> 26:40.752
when you could've
picked me?
What?

26:40.760 --> 26:43.593
I'm the one who knows
how to organize,
keep secrets,

26:43.600 --> 26:45.397
and do everything
betterthan he everwill.

26:45.400 --> 26:46.469
Hold on!

26:46.480 --> 26:48.198
Do none of your species
have brains?

26:48.200 --> 26:51.590
Proudly, mine does not.
Not even a nervous system.

26:51.760 --> 26:55.309
A talking plant?
That is so awesome!

26:56.280 --> 26:59.192
There's intelligent life
on this world after all!

26:59.920 --> 27:02.480
Wait a minute.
I'm intelligent life!

27:02.480 --> 27:03.959
We don't have
a minute, Rod.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.871
Not if we don't
want your mom
coming up here,

27:05.880 --> 27:07.552
and wondering where we are.

27:07.560 --> 27:09.790
And I'm good
at things, like...

27:09.800 --> 27:12.758
Look, Rod and I
have to show up
for our evening meal,

27:12.760 --> 27:15.718
butwe'll be right back
to work out a real plan
to keep you safe.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.349
Don'tjust stand there.

27:17.360 --> 27:20.909
We have to keep up
our appearances,
and I am the expert at that.

27:24.200 --> 27:25.235
Don't worry.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.635
I got your back.
I have everybody's back.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.633
Back?
I've got my back.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.995
I'm not quite sure
what she means.

27:35.920 --> 27:39.708
There is something more
we must tell you
about our presence here.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.073
We are on a mission.

27:41.080 --> 27:44.516
Yeah, Captain Grakker
said to prevent total
planetary disaster.

27:44.840 --> 27:48.230
At the hand of
the Galaxy's Most Evil
Wanted Criminal, B'KR.

27:48.240 --> 27:50.595
B'what?
B'KR. Pay attention.

27:50.600 --> 27:53.637
On yourworld,
B'KR is in disguise.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.835
To move more easily
among your kind,

27:55.840 --> 27:58.957
slowly and surely,
laying his plans
against you.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.837
What kind of disguise
are we talking here?

28:00.840 --> 28:03.308
According to our
monitoring sources,

28:03.320 --> 28:06.630
he is hiding here
under the name "Beck-Er."

28:06.640 --> 28:09.837
Becker? Billy Becker's
father is an alien?

28:10.040 --> 28:13.112
You know this
bipedal meat-pod?

28:13.120 --> 28:17.477
I know his kid.
He goes to my school.
He's gotta be adopted.

28:17.480 --> 28:21.598
Gaining the trust
of the child could help us
to investigate the father.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.274
Billy Becker might
say he trusts you,

28:24.280 --> 28:27.192
but only to get close enough
to smash a bug
on your forehead.

28:27.960 --> 28:28.949
Feels disgusting.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.593
Tastes even worse.

28:31.840 --> 28:35.515
My cousin, Venus Claptrap,
would disagree,
but moving on...

28:36.840 --> 28:38.239
Deputy Allbright,

28:38.240 --> 28:41.357
Madame Pong and I
will accompany you
to school tomorrow,

28:41.680 --> 28:45.514
and ifanything goes wrong,
the Galactic Patrol will
hold you accountable,

28:45.520 --> 28:48.080
and you will stand trial
foryour crimes.

28:48.080 --> 28:51.436
The Patrol does not
take the loss
of its agents lightly.

28:51.440 --> 28:54.034
Thanks. I'm sure
I'll sleep much better
tonight knowing that.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.352
In the meantime. Elspeth,
would you be so kind
as to continue

28:57.360 --> 29:01.956
to oversee security perimeters
and the operations
within Rod's house?

29:01.960 --> 29:04.110
What? Like you're not
gonna rememberthat?

29:04.120 --> 29:05.553
It's not for me.

29:05.560 --> 29:08.279
It's forwhen
something goes wrong
at your school tomorrow,

29:08.280 --> 29:09.349
because it will.

29:09.640 --> 29:14.919
I'll need these notes
to testify at
your trial, Deputy.

29:18.560 --> 29:21.279
Hey, Mickey.
Hey, Rod.

29:21.480 --> 29:23.948
How are your
imaginary aliens?

29:24.880 --> 29:27.838
Did he say "aliens"?

29:27.840 --> 29:30.991
I never said anything
about imaginary aliens.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.797
Well, not "imaginary."

29:32.800 --> 29:35.837
You said that
they were really small,
and they had, like, ray-guns.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.558
That's it.
I'm ventilating
his skull.

29:37.560 --> 29:40.870
Raz. Raz. Raz.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.231
Buddy, I thought
we'd talked about this.

29:45.160 --> 29:48.436
Oh. Pudge-Boy.
Just finishing up here.

29:52.320 --> 29:55.835
Right in there.
Same time tomorrow, Raz?
Can't I get a day off?

29:56.080 --> 29:59.038
Yeah, sure, whatever.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.237
Where was I?
Oh, yeah.

30:05.240 --> 30:08.277
Pudge-Boy! You'rejust in...

30:09.520 --> 30:13.035
Hey, what's this?

30:13.040 --> 30:15.873
Not mint on card,
but nice detailing.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.279
Where'd you get him,
Allbright?

30:17.280 --> 30:19.350
I found him.

30:19.560 --> 30:22.597
Thought so.
'Cause I lost one
just like this yesterday.

30:22.600 --> 30:24.033
But...
But what?

30:28.960 --> 30:30.109
Nothing.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.190
Thought so.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.396
Everyone's a critic.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.439
Hey, buddy.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.915
Hi, Mom.
What's the egg whisk for?

30:55.920 --> 30:58.434
The little aliens
need to fix their ship.

30:59.480 --> 31:03.268
Huh. 0h, of course, they do.
Well, just bring it back
when they're done.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.474
Agreed.

31:14.720 --> 31:18.269
The Basic Drake Equation
combines all your
favorite subjects.

31:18.280 --> 31:21.511
Statistics,
Astronomy, Chemistry,

31:21.520 --> 31:24.592
and Biology.

31:24.600 --> 31:28.434
It's a way for us to think
about how many worlds
orbiting other suns

31:28.440 --> 31:32.592
might have
extraterrestrial civilizations
we could communicate with.

31:33.000 --> 31:37.278
Astronomers know
the first few numbers
to put into the equation.

31:37.280 --> 31:39.953
These numbers give us
a good estimate

31:39.960 --> 31:42.349
of the number of
Earth-like planets

31:42.360 --> 31:45.397
there are in our galaxy.

31:46.120 --> 31:48.793
Now, we get to the part
of the equation

31:48.800 --> 31:51.792
where we have to make
some educated guesses,

31:51.800 --> 31:56.794
and these guesses
involve the difference
between Chemistry and Biology.

31:56.800 --> 32:01.954
First, of these
40 billion potentially
Earth-like planets,

32:01.960 --> 32:04.235
how many have life?

32:08.120 --> 32:12.272
Just having simple Iifeforms,
like bacteria, or plants,

32:12.280 --> 32:14.555
or even small animals
isn't enough.

32:14.720 --> 32:18.156
So, then of those
earth-like planets,

32:18.160 --> 32:20.230
how many have
intelligent life?

32:24.040 --> 32:27.635
And then,
of those planets
with intelligent life,

32:27.640 --> 32:30.518
how many go on
to develop radio,

32:30.520 --> 32:35.196
or other means
of communication that
we can detect from Earth?

32:35.760 --> 32:40.276
Remember that humans lived
on Planet Earth
for millions of years

32:40.280 --> 32:44.034
before we invented
radio and television,

32:44.040 --> 32:46.508
and then lasers
for sending signals.

32:46.520 --> 32:48.158
And who knows.

32:48.160 --> 32:50.674
Maybe there are
still incredible
communication technologies

32:50.680 --> 32:52.113
that we know
nothing about today,

32:52.120 --> 32:54.680
because we can't imagine them.

32:54.680 --> 32:57.274
But they will he invented
sometime in the future.

32:57.280 --> 33:00.397
Maybe even by one of you.

33:00.400 --> 33:04.075
Depending on the numbers
used in the last parts
of the equation,

33:04.480 --> 33:07.631
we get a range of
possible answers,

33:07.640 --> 33:09.676
so that the Drake
Equation tells us

33:09.960 --> 33:13.430
the number of possible
extraterrestrial civilizations

33:13.440 --> 33:18.753
can be anywhere
from one, ours,
to more than 30 million!

33:18.760 --> 33:23.151
Whatever the true answer
to the Drake Equation
turns out to be,

33:23.160 --> 33:26.470
a big number
into the hundreds
of thousands,

33:26.480 --> 33:29.472
or a small number
that you can count
on your hands...

33:29.480 --> 33:30.549
Yes!

33:30.560 --> 33:32.710
...orsimply one,
it will be something

33:32.720 --> 33:34.472
that will change
our understanding

33:34.480 --> 33:37.438
of the universe
as we now know it.

33:37.440 --> 33:42.116
As the famous
science-fiction writer,
Arthur C. Clarke, once said,

33:42.120 --> 33:44.839
"Sometimes I think we're
alone in the universe,

33:44.840 --> 33:47.195
"and sometimes
lthink we're not.

33:47.200 --> 33:50.590
"In either case,
the idea is quite staggering."

33:55.520 --> 33:56.999
All right, class,

33:57.000 --> 33:59.355
please take out
your science textbooks,

33:59.360 --> 34:01.920
and we are going
to go to Chapter 10.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.436
That is page 79.

34:06.800 --> 34:08.279
Now, pay attention

34:08.280 --> 34:12.478
because this is definitely
going to be on the final exam.

34:12.480 --> 34:15.358
Do I have a volunteer
to read the first paragraph?

34:17.520 --> 34:18.509
Spa Fon!

34:18.719 --> 34:21.313
Whoa. Little pitcher plants
have big ears.

34:21.800 --> 34:24.792
Let me handle this,
and when I say, "Handle,"
I mean, "Ieaf' it to me.

34:24.800 --> 34:25.869
Ooh! Another good one!

34:26.280 --> 34:29.989
Apologies, youngling.
My choice of words
were most intemperate.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.672
You should hear my dad.

34:31.679 --> 34:34.319
Indeed. As the snavel
and wonkus teaches us,

34:34.320 --> 34:38.313
we should all listen
to our parents from whom
much wisdom flows.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.117
So, how does a plant...

34:40.120 --> 34:43.157
Well, how does anyone
get to join
the Galactic Patrol?

34:43.159 --> 34:46.152
Each has his, her,
or its reason.

34:46.159 --> 34:48.719
Phil here Is on
a quest for his roots.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.599
I'm working
my asparagus off.

34:52.239 --> 34:53.514
How about you?

34:53.520 --> 34:58.275
Warrior Science compels
all who are able to protect
those who are not.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.994
But ifyou all join
for different reasons,

35:01.000 --> 35:04.436
doesn't that make you
all argue about what to do
and how to do it?

35:04.600 --> 35:08.957
Cleveryoungling.
A healthy differing of
opinions is as necessary

35:08.960 --> 35:11.758
as the frelnik
and groof in spring.
Well said.

35:11.760 --> 35:13.034
Okay.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.429
As you can see,
despite our differences,

35:15.440 --> 35:18.591
the Ferkel's crew
are united as members
of the same team,

35:18.600 --> 35:20.955
helping each other
to accomplish
our mission,

35:20.960 --> 35:22.837
just like you
and your cousin.

35:22.840 --> 35:25.035
What? Rod and me?

35:25.040 --> 35:26.632
We're not on any team.

35:26.640 --> 35:29.473
Young Elspeth,
you must ignore
the confusing surface,

35:29.480 --> 35:31.471
and dig down to find
the truth beneath it.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.917
That Is where
you will discover
what unites you with Rod.

35:34.920 --> 35:37.480
Yeah, like cracking open
a weird-looking nut shell

35:37.640 --> 35:39.596
to find the good
stuff inside.

35:39.920 --> 35:41.399
Think on that,
young Elspeth,

35:41.400 --> 35:45.598
and you will see what
connects you with Rod
instead of what does not.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.558
Iguess
it wouldn't hurt to...
Hold on.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.232
What's that?
Uh, the Ferkel?

35:50.240 --> 35:52.231
It's only been there,
like, forever.

35:52.440 --> 35:54.874
I think I know what's wrong
with your ship.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.317
Squa Tront!

36:25.240 --> 36:26.673
Is that gonna be
enough for lunch?

36:27.080 --> 36:30.072
Oh, yes. Earth paper is
surprisingly nutritious.

36:30.080 --> 36:33.959
Yeah, you should
try it sometime.
It will blow your mind!

36:34.800 --> 36:35.915
I love this stuff!

36:47.360 --> 36:48.713
Those forthe aliens?

36:49.600 --> 36:50.715
Uh-huh.

36:51.640 --> 36:52.914
Okay.

36:57.600 --> 36:58.669
Hmm.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.997
All right, Allbrightl
Give it back!

37:05.480 --> 37:06.879
Give what back?

37:06.880 --> 37:11.590
You know,
the little monster guy.
You stole him from my bag.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.158
I didn't. Honest.

37:13.160 --> 37:16.630
You telling me
hejust crawled out
and walked off on his own?

37:16.920 --> 37:18.751
What're you trying
to pull, Pudge-Boy?

37:18.760 --> 37:19.909
Nothing!

37:19.920 --> 37:21.194
I'm just trying to
get through the day

37:21.200 --> 37:22.633
without getting
my face pounded in.

37:22.640 --> 37:26.235
Well, better luck
tomorrow.

38:05.240 --> 38:06.355
Ow!

38:11.520 --> 38:12.839
How did you move so fast?

38:12.840 --> 38:14.558
Look at all
the practice I've had.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.711
We are not done!

38:18.240 --> 38:19.719
Whoa. Igot you.

38:23.640 --> 38:24.993
Did you guys do that?

38:25.000 --> 38:29.596
Madame Pong
has performed an act
of temporal displacement,

38:29.600 --> 38:32.717
and it has temporarily
harshed her mellow.

38:32.720 --> 38:35.029
You really need to start
on some language lessons.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.558
The aliens need our plants?

38:49.080 --> 38:51.196
No. Just Phil.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.315
Phil?

38:52.320 --> 38:54.436
He's lonely.

38:55.760 --> 38:58.433
Huh. This Is getting weird.

39:28.360 --> 39:30.430
Huh?
What?
Who goes there?

39:35.200 --> 39:36.269
Busted!

39:38.280 --> 39:39.793
Execute Plan 'B'!

39:39.800 --> 39:40.994
Begin Operation Cover-up.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.117
Sorry, guys. Be quiet.

39:52.480 --> 39:53.595
Ooh. Hello.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.749
Hi, Aunt Gwen.

39:54.920 --> 39:56.433
We're having quiet time.

39:57.240 --> 39:59.037
Mmm. Amazing.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.117
What's this?

40:20.560 --> 40:22.596
Are the little aliens
all done with these?

40:22.760 --> 40:26.150
Yep.
Mission accomplished.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.629
I'll just bring them
back to the kitchen, then.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.551
Carry on.
Will do, Aunt Gwen.

40:34.560 --> 40:35.675
Hmm.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.679
That was close.

40:47.440 --> 40:50.398
All right, class.
Before we get started
this afternoon,

40:50.400 --> 40:53.358
I'll go ahead
and collect
your math worksheets.

40:53.360 --> 40:54.713
Thank you.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.039
You good in there?

40:56.040 --> 40:57.473
It's pretty good, yeah.
Thank you.

40:57.480 --> 40:58.799
Allis well, young Allbright.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.358
I couldn't eat
another shred.

41:00.360 --> 41:02.715
...sure you got
your name on the sheet.
I can.

41:02.720 --> 41:04.870
Fortunately, we found
an emergency back-up supply.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.438
- Emergency back-up?
- Thank you.

41:14.720 --> 41:16.278
You want some, kiddo?

41:19.520 --> 41:20.669
No.

41:25.640 --> 41:28.712
Rod, is your worksheet done?

41:28.720 --> 41:31.712
Yes, but I can't
hand it in right now.

41:32.360 --> 41:34.078
Because?

41:35.160 --> 41:37.958
Aliens ate my homework,
Ms. Maloney.

41:46.240 --> 41:49.869
As a reminder,
gym classes are canceled
for the rest of the week

41:49.880 --> 41:51.757
because of science
fair preparations.
Get back in here!

41:52.320 --> 41:55.278
Principal Carter
will judge the exhibits
tomorrow afternoon

41:55.280 --> 41:57.953
and award ribbons
in 10 categories.

41:57.960 --> 42:02.112
In the event of a snow day,
judging will take place
after the winter break.

42:02.120 --> 42:08.958
The computer club will meet
in room 11011110
at 00:00:001 :00.

42:10.760 --> 42:12.830
The cleaning staff requests
that students please remove

42:12.840 --> 42:16.196
all perishable food items
from lockers by Friday.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.315
Hey, check this out, man.

42:18.280 --> 42:19.474
Shock Rocks.

42:19.480 --> 42:21.755
No! No, come on...

42:23.600 --> 42:25.477
Mmm.Ahh.

42:30.120 --> 42:31.269
Uh...

42:32.520 --> 42:33.669
Well, Rod seemed...

42:36.600 --> 42:38.556
You thought X was good?
Y is even better.

42:50.520 --> 42:52.636
0h.

43:06.640 --> 43:07.993
No, no, no.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.592
Go away, go away!

43:24.640 --> 43:25.629
Oh, my God!

43:44.480 --> 43:45.799
Send them home.

43:46.200 --> 43:49.192
Can you believe it?
Hardly any detention.

43:49.200 --> 43:52.112
They're probably afraid
you'll explode
on school property.

43:52.120 --> 43:56.910
Yeah! Awesome, wasn't it?
Ingredient Z will make
the best volcano ever!

43:57.440 --> 44:00.512
Maybe I should
just stick with
what I know will work.

44:00.520 --> 44:03.193
Like what?
Your aliens?

44:03.200 --> 44:06.829
They're not my aliens.
They're...

44:06.840 --> 44:07.909
What?

44:09.840 --> 44:11.592
They're classified.

44:17.360 --> 44:19.430
Oh, my gosh.
Hey!

44:23.760 --> 44:26.479
Oh. Greetings upon you,
Earth child.

44:26.480 --> 44:30.553
You have arrived at
a most fortuitous time.

44:30.560 --> 44:34.838
Elspeth has solved
the puzzle of our
malfunctioning embiggener.

44:34.840 --> 44:36.990
Her? No way.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.639
We thought the problemo
was with all the,
you know,

44:39.640 --> 44:42.871
science-y techno-thingies
on the inside of the ship.

44:42.880 --> 44:44.199
Super complicated.

44:44.200 --> 44:45.792
Would melt your
little meaty brain

44:45.800 --> 44:47.836
and make It go all
gooey and like that.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.034
Well, itwould.

44:49.040 --> 44:50.598
Butwith
the eyes of a warrior,

44:50.600 --> 44:54.798
Elspeth perceived that
which no one else could see
on the outside of the ship.

44:54.800 --> 44:56.677
A part fell off. See?

44:56.680 --> 44:59.194
It's called
a Hydrocoptic Marzul Vane.

44:59.600 --> 45:02.398
Without it,
the Ferkel's embiggener
won't work.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.789
Commendations,
Earthling.
Come on.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.268
The only reason she found it
is because I wasn't here.

45:07.280 --> 45:08.474
Give up, Roddie.

45:08.920 --> 45:11.639
I guess I'll just need
to find a new
Hydrophobic Martian Cane.

45:11.800 --> 45:13.711
Hydrocoptic Marzul Vane.

45:13.720 --> 45:17.395
The Tar says Earth science
isn't advanced enough
to make one.

45:17.400 --> 45:20.551
So, the Ferkel
might be small forever,
and so will her crew.

45:21.840 --> 45:25.037
Backwater worlds
are all alike,
Nothing useful anywhere!

45:25.360 --> 45:29.239
No. Earth has something
no otherworld has.

45:31.720 --> 45:32.835
B'KR.

45:32.840 --> 45:34.990
If Billy Becker's father
really is an alien,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.468
he'll have alien technology,
too, right?

45:39.240 --> 45:43.518
Not bad for a Iifeform
lacking chlorophyll
and leaves.

45:43.520 --> 45:46.751
I propose we act
on Deputy Allbright's
brilliant plan at once.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.993
Captain?
Agreed.

45:50.200 --> 45:51.599
Urn, what brilliant plan?

45:52.200 --> 45:53.918
What he said.

45:53.920 --> 45:57.833
If B'KR has what we need,
then we must take it.

46:04.080 --> 46:06.799
Pew! Pew! Zap! Pew!

46:08.560 --> 46:10.869
Bye, Mom!
Don't forget my volcano!

46:10.880 --> 46:13.348
Oh, I'll drop it off
as soon as
the babysitter gets here.

46:13.360 --> 46:14.793
Elspeth,
are you going out, too?

46:15.520 --> 46:18.671
I'm gonna
Show her my school.
She can use my old bike.

46:19.240 --> 46:21.470
Sounds good.
Well, have a nice time.

46:21.480 --> 46:25.029
Thanks, Morn. See ya!
Bye.

46:25.480 --> 46:28.677
Isn't it nice
to see your brother and cousin
getting along so well?

46:28.680 --> 46:32.878
They're only doing it
because the mean little alien
said ifthey didn't...

46:32.880 --> 46:34.632
He'd fry their brains
with his ray-guns.

46:34.640 --> 46:36.631
Pew! Pew! Zap!

46:36.960 --> 46:39.554
Well, why would
the mean little alien
say that?

46:41.040 --> 46:43.554
That's classified!
That's classified!

46:43.800 --> 46:44.949
Oh.

46:45.880 --> 46:49.759
I've never seen it snow
just in one spot.
It's crazy!

46:49.760 --> 46:51.876
My mom says
it's only happened
once before,

46:51.880 --> 46:53.757
right about when
she met my dad,

46:53.760 --> 46:55.637
a huge snowstorm,
just in Seldom Seen.

46:55.640 --> 46:57.631
Isn't anything
normal around here?

46:57.800 --> 47:03.158
There, I showed you
my school. Technically,
I didn't lie to Mom.

47:03.160 --> 47:04.388
Just like yourdad, huh?

47:04.920 --> 47:07.718
My dad never lied.
What's wrong with that?

47:07.720 --> 47:10.871
Rod, your father left you.

47:10.880 --> 47:12.916
He promised
he'd comeback.

47:12.920 --> 47:16.708
And you believed him?
Adults lie, all the time.

47:17.280 --> 47:19.510
"There's nothing
to be worried about, sweetie."

47:19.520 --> 47:23.559
"Everything's going
to be okay, honey."
As if.

47:23.560 --> 47:28.350
Maybe your parents he
to you, but not mine,
and not my dad.

47:28.920 --> 47:32.959
If he's so great,
then where is he?

47:35.680 --> 47:37.238
We've got to go.

47:37.560 --> 47:40.677
Let's hurry up. I've never
ditched school before.

48:04.400 --> 48:06.436
Status report
from the flight deck.

48:12.320 --> 48:14.834
The Ferkel's scan
is complete.

48:14.840 --> 48:18.071
No intelligent life
inside the house,

48:18.080 --> 48:20.469
and no human life, either...

48:20.640 --> 48:23.393
Phil, that's not helpful.

48:34.960 --> 48:37.315
Ew. ltsmells.

48:39.360 --> 48:42.557
Yeah, like pizza.

48:46.240 --> 48:48.708
Boys. It's like adults
don't even live here.

48:48.720 --> 48:52.076
You don't have to be
a kid to like pizza.

48:53.320 --> 48:54.799
Ew! Ugh!

49:01.360 --> 49:03.157
Oh, my gosh, he killed them!
He killed them!

49:03.160 --> 49:05.071
Billy Becker
killed his parents!

49:08.240 --> 49:09.798
Ooh. Ew.

49:10.320 --> 49:11.548
Those aren'treal.

49:11.560 --> 49:15.030
They're artificial replicas
too advanced for Earth.

49:16.960 --> 49:19.713
So, alien android parents?

49:19.720 --> 49:22.280
Parentoids.

49:22.280 --> 49:23.508
I guess.

49:24.120 --> 49:27.237
But if Billy Becker's
father isn't real,

49:27.240 --> 49:29.470
then that means
the real B'KR is...

49:29.480 --> 49:30.993
Billy.
Billy.

49:36.640 --> 49:39.393
Can you believe it?
I believe in aliens.

49:39.400 --> 49:42.836
Do you have something
harder to believe than that?

49:42.840 --> 49:47.789
Billy, my archenemy,
the rotten,
lying little kid.

49:48.560 --> 49:51.028
He's a fugitive mastermind
from another planet,

49:51.040 --> 49:53.474
wanted across the galaxy
for his hideous crimes.

49:53.480 --> 49:56.711
And?
So, what's that say
about my life?

49:56.720 --> 49:59.314
I mean,
a lot of kids get bullied
at one point or another,

49:59.320 --> 50:00.799
but how many get
bullied by a kid

50:00.800 --> 50:03.872
who turns out to be
a criminal genius
from the stars in disguise?

50:03.880 --> 50:05.472
Sort of cool, really.

50:06.040 --> 50:07.155
What?

50:07.160 --> 50:10.948
I mean, it's not
like you're some loser
who gets bullied by anyone.

50:10.960 --> 50:14.236
You get bullied
by an advanced
alien intellect.

50:14.240 --> 50:16.276
Not a lot of people
can put up with that.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.555
So, I'm not a loser?

50:18.560 --> 50:21.120
Not when it comes
to standing up
to an alien menace,

50:22.840 --> 50:26.515
but you sort of
dress funny, and, you know,
a diet couldn't...

50:33.720 --> 50:35.278
And we're down.

50:35.280 --> 50:37.157
At least
there's a bright side
to Billy Becker being B’KR.

50:37.760 --> 50:40.069
Bright Side? Really?

50:40.080 --> 50:41.672
This is B'KR'S hangout.

50:41.880 --> 50:46.590
Right? He's got to have
some sort of cool
alien tech stuff here,

50:46.600 --> 50:48.750
maybe even something
that can fix
the embiggener.

50:48.960 --> 50:51.838
A most timely reminder,
young deputy.

50:51.840 --> 50:55.628
Captain, we should
begin our interior probe
of this domicile at once.

50:55.640 --> 50:59.792
You two, search this room.
Report if you find
what we need.

50:59.800 --> 51:00.915
Agreed.
Agreed.

51:21.080 --> 51:24.755
Only an alien can eat
this much junk food and live.

51:25.360 --> 51:29.512
He's got all the latest games,
but I've never seen
this one before.

51:45.520 --> 51:47.511
Never seen
this before, either.

51:47.520 --> 51:48.919
We're not here
to play, Roddie.

51:50.640 --> 51:52.471
This Is serious.

51:52.760 --> 51:56.719
What if this is some sort of
alien game console
with alien games.

51:56.920 --> 51:58.035
Looks like a map.

51:58.040 --> 52:02.750
Whatever it is, it looks like
that parts some sort
of alien countdown.

52:07.160 --> 52:09.071
Mom, Dad,
I'm home early!

52:13.280 --> 52:15.794
Come on. Hurry up!

52:25.760 --> 52:27.716
Feels good
to be home.

52:32.240 --> 52:34.310
Oh. Hey, Roger.

52:45.400 --> 52:46.958
Ahh.

52:48.280 --> 52:49.633
How was your day?

52:49.640 --> 52:51.835
Oh, that's right.

52:51.840 --> 52:53.159
I ripped out
all your good parts

52:53.160 --> 52:55.993
to make something
halfway useful.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.399
Bit brains.

52:57.960 --> 52:58.995
Boop!

53:03.520 --> 53:05.795
Ugh. Time to slip out
of this old thing.

53:13.480 --> 53:17.234
Ah. Sweet dwarf star.

53:37.520 --> 53:40.159
Hello, Pudge-Boy
and friend.

53:51.920 --> 53:54.275
I guess that's
how he can afford
all those games.

53:54.280 --> 53:55.349
I wonder if it's real.

53:55.360 --> 53:57.874
Rod, we need to find
a way to get out of here!

53:57.880 --> 54:00.474
I know.
Check through the windows.

54:01.080 --> 54:03.753
The Ferkel can't
blast through these.
It's steel. We're trapped!

54:04.600 --> 54:06.989
Where is the Ferkel,
anyway?

54:11.000 --> 54:13.116
Maybe he didn't see us
come in here.

54:13.920 --> 54:16.559
Or maybe I did!

54:26.040 --> 54:27.029
Hey, kids!

54:27.520 --> 54:29.590
Rod,
what are we going to do?

54:33.480 --> 54:34.469
Huh?

54:50.680 --> 54:55.151
I know where you live,
Allbright, and I know
how to hurt you.

55:01.240 --> 55:04.357
Almost down, almost.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.672
Perfect landing.

55:09.680 --> 55:12.399
Um, why are you
all so big?

55:12.400 --> 55:14.152
Uh, we're not.

55:14.160 --> 55:16.310
Then that means we're...

55:16.320 --> 55:18.834
You are, yeah.
But if you can't...

55:18.840 --> 55:20.831
Then we can't...
Correct.

55:20.840 --> 55:24.037
No! Not correct!
I can't be small!

55:27.240 --> 55:28.275
You're small.

55:31.160 --> 55:34.277
Elspeth, we're all small.
It's notjust aboutyou.

55:34.280 --> 55:37.113
Yeah. What he said.

55:40.360 --> 55:43.955
Linda, Eric, you be good
for Mrs. Nesbitt, okay?

55:43.960 --> 55:45.598
Okay, Morn.
Okay, Morn.

55:45.600 --> 55:47.318
I'll see you later in
the afternoon, okay?

55:47.320 --> 55:49.436
See you tonight,
Mrs. Allbright.
Bye! Have fun!

55:49.440 --> 55:50.634
Bye.
Bye.

56:43.760 --> 56:46.558
Do these come
in any other color?

56:46.560 --> 56:49.154
Actually,
you look sort of cool.

56:49.160 --> 56:50.388
You do, too, I guess.

56:58.280 --> 56:59.395
Plink!

56:59.400 --> 57:00.674
What was that?

57:00.680 --> 57:03.194
Plink!
Plink?

57:03.200 --> 57:05.998
Yes. Like most plants,
Phil has a runner.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.230
Hello, Plinkster!
He's my best bud.

57:08.480 --> 57:11.711
Though, the term "symbiote"
would be more precise.

57:11.720 --> 57:15.838
On their homeworld,
plants and runners co-evolved
to help each other.

57:15.840 --> 57:16.875
Plink!

57:19.600 --> 57:22.717
Ooh! Just the thing
for my root canal.

57:24.040 --> 57:25.553
I've Identified the Image.

57:27.080 --> 57:28.752
Hey,
we saw that at Billy's.

57:28.760 --> 57:30.113
How'd you find it?

57:30.120 --> 57:32.031
Scanned it
when we plucked you
out of there.

57:32.040 --> 57:36.238
I might be
going out on a limb,
but it's obviously a map.

57:36.240 --> 57:38.310
Map? Obviously.

57:38.320 --> 57:41.835
Okay, okay.
You were right.
Map of what?

57:41.840 --> 57:45.150
B'KR's planning
to build a hypertunnel.

57:45.160 --> 57:49.119
Dimensional instabilities
are already disturbing
our atmosphere here.

57:49.120 --> 57:51.156
Is that why
we're getting so
much crazy snow?

57:51.160 --> 57:54.994
And itwill get even crazier
until this countdown ends.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.194
Countdown?

57:56.200 --> 58:01.194
In one hour,
two minutes, 26.4 seconds
from now, roughly.

58:01.200 --> 58:03.156
So, what will happen
when the countdown ends

58:03.160 --> 58:04.309
and the hypertunnel opens?

58:04.320 --> 58:08.359
In a nutshell,
the end of yourworld
as you know it.

58:08.360 --> 58:09.873
What?
What?

58:12.200 --> 58:15.795
We knew B'KR
was planning the total
destruction of the Earth.

58:16.720 --> 58:19.439
This shows us how
he intends to achieve it.

58:19.920 --> 58:23.799
Alcatron Prime,
the Patrol's super
prison planetoid.

58:23.800 --> 58:27.918
It holds thousands
of the galaxy's
super-worst criminals.

58:28.800 --> 58:29.915
Planet Earth.

58:29.920 --> 58:35.153
More like ex-planet Earth,
as in excruciatingly
exterminated.

58:35.160 --> 58:37.469
Explosively extinguished.
Extremely...

58:37.480 --> 58:39.710
Phil? That's enough.

58:39.720 --> 58:40.869
What?

58:40.880 --> 58:44.031
Why would B'KR
release thousands of
galactic criminals here?

58:44.360 --> 58:46.430
The simple answer
is to be cruel.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.991
In the civilized galaxy,

58:49.000 --> 58:52.356
cruelty to others is
the greatest crime of all,

58:52.360 --> 58:55.875
and B'KR is
the greatest criminal
of them all.

58:55.880 --> 58:58.678
Millions have wept.

58:58.680 --> 59:01.274
There's got to be
a way to stop him.
There is!

59:01.280 --> 59:05.637
The flashing countdown thingy
shows how long we have
till yourworld

59:05.640 --> 59:07.949
and the prison
planetoid align in,

59:07.960 --> 59:11.191
like, a dimensional web
that is really complicated,

59:11.200 --> 59:13.839
and you'll
never understand it,

59:13.840 --> 59:18.436
but that's when B'KR
will need an Activator
to make his hypertunnel.

59:18.440 --> 59:20.749
So, if we find
an Activator...

59:20.760 --> 59:23.957
Then we can destroy it
before he gets a chance
to create the tunnel.

59:23.960 --> 59:27.191
And the galactic
super criminals won't
be able to invade Earth.

59:27.200 --> 59:32.991
In 58 minutes,
3.2 seconds from now,
more or less.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.150
So, how do we find
an Activator?

59:35.160 --> 59:37.628
It'll be close to
the dimensional disruption

59:37.640 --> 59:39.198
that's causing
your strange weather.

59:41.040 --> 59:42.519
So, it's in my school?

59:42.520 --> 59:44.238
Bingo, sprout.

59:44.240 --> 59:46.800
But to find exactly
where B'KR's hidden it,

59:46.800 --> 59:48.631
we'll need roots
on the ground.

59:48.800 --> 59:50.199
What's going on?

59:50.200 --> 59:54.398
Incoming communication
on the galactic
emergency band!

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.235
Hello, Galactic Patrol.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.398
Hey, he's in my house!

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.630
Oh! This is good.
Do you mind?

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.712
I'm going to make this simple,
just like all of you.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.711
You have something I want,

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.236
and l have something you want.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.915
Time to fly!
Those maggots need saving.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.038
What's that say?

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.679
It's a warning from B'KR.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.319
Lnexactly,
it translates something like,

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.436
"Captain Grakker,
surrender your crew,

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.238
"orthe grublings
will be forever blue."

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:06.075
Those poor corn kernels!
He popped them to pieces.
Murderer!

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.071
Activate external speakers.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.714
Now, you're talking!

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:16.270
B'KR, release
the grublings at once!

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.748
No. Not untilyou give up,

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:23.914
or else the Allbright brats
will remain frozen forever.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.590
Captain, there's only
one course of action
that we can take.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.149
Surrender.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.957
What?
What?

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.999
Well, according
to the Galactic Code,
all larva must be protected.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.834
Remember, all is not lost
until all is lost.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.673
Aren't you
a ray ofsunshine?
Yeah.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.676
B'KR, hear my words.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:55.355
We will surrender,
but only if
you free the larva.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.154
Done. Now, get in here.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.593
Open sesame seed.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.116
My scans show
six crew onboard,

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.873
so, I want all six
to surrender, no weapons,

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.553
and then I'll release
my captives.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.348
Shutting down
all systems ASAP.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.390
Wait. There're seven
of us, not six.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:59.154
B'KR must'vejust scanned
for animal life.
He doesn't know about Phil.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:03.153
That's his loss,
because I am a plant
worth knowing.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:06.359
Then Warrior Science
tells us exactly
what to do next.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.920
Young humans,
come closer.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:10.913
Hey!

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.715
Ow!

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:13.994
What was that for?

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.513
A simple transfer
of knowledge,

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.988
so, you will know how to act
when the time is right.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.912
An anti-gravity
flying belt?

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.514
What, you thought it was just
to hold up your pants?

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.555
Hah. Yeah.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.151
This is amazing, Rod.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:30.277
I know how to work this.
I know how to fly!

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.716
A simple transfer
of knowledge.
Forwhen the time is right.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:58.753
Hello, Pudge-Boy and friends,
including Captain Grakker.

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:00.637
lthought
I recognized you
at school.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.995
We have a deal, B'KR!

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.071
That tickled!
Again!

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.396
What a stimulating
collection of artifacts.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.757
The intellect that chose them
must be of the highest order.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.637
Linda's always messing
with my stuff.

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.111
Status report,

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:56.279
lam harshed,
yet retain my mellowness.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.589
I am fully operational.

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.797
I'm not. This place
is a mess, Rod.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.712
Ow! I hit something
really hard.

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.873
What the heck is
this thing, anyway?

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.075
Plink!

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.310
Flibblx be honored!
It is a Warrior Miracle!

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.914
Rod, you've found
the missing piece
of the embiggener.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.155
The Hippo
Marsupial Weathervane?

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.874
Hydrocoptic... Never mind.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.038
Linda must've shoved it
in here the day
you trashed my window.

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:27.750
All we have to do now
to enlarge the Ferkel
and ourselves...

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.036
Is put the Vane back
in its proper place
on the outside of the ship.

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:33.235
We're locked inside
a smelly backpack.

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.549
How are we going to
get back on the Ferkel?

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.596
As Warrior Science
teaches us,

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.797
PIanjite-fribble wasn't
smelled with a single sniff.

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.472
Mmm-hmm.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:43.869
True.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:01.318
Time to shake things up.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.749
What's he doing?

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:06.988
Shaking us!

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.274
Why?

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.794
He probably thinks
it's funny.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.518
Millions have wept.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.158
Make that
a million and one.

01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:59.512
This Is our chance to escape.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.155
How? We're upside
down on the flap.

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:05.869
Warrior Science teaches us
that when there is
no other choice...

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.316
We make the choice we must.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.909
The Berserker Module.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.510
Captain Grakker,
are you ready?

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.671
Madame Pong,
lam a Friskian fighter.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:25.672
I was ready
the day I was extruded
from the vats.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:33.630
Time to get
this party started.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.399
Everyone back.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.916
Grakker! Bad wall!

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.316
Bad wall! Kill!

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.716
Bad wall! Bad wall!
Die, die!

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.271
Oh-ho! Yes.

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:37.835
The sap is rising.

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:42.197
Ohh.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.839
That feels good.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:59.310
Oh! Look who's gone to seed.

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:02.915
Now, feel the fury
of the Ferkel's
fearsome fighter!

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.353
Kreegah!

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:12.157
Kreegah!

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:17.715
Kreegah!

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.078
We're not on solid ground!

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.832
Grakker! No!
The wall is dead!

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:28.719
Brace for impact!

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:49.790
The mighty Grakker triumphs!
Bad wall dead! Kreegah!

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.830
Rod, Elspeth, quickly!

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.474
Who's next?

01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.549
Uh-oh.

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.909
Oh, no.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.313
We've got to get
you guys out of here!

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:20.517
No, young Allbright,
you have a different mission.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.512
Trust in Warrior Science!
But, Tar...

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.630
Oh. Right. It's time.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:33.872
Phil reports
that the Ferkel is
back up to full power.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.191
It's up to you now, Rod.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:40.113
Hold on. Why him?
I'm the one who saw
itwas missing.

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:44.079
Young Elspeth, each of us
has our own part
to play in this mission.

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.550
And this one is something
an Allbright should do.

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.950
He's getting ready
to blast the Ferkel!

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.996
Phillogenous esk Piemondum!

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.549
Now!

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.911
It's mulching time!

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.596
Ifeel the need for speed.

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:16.589
Whoo-hoo!

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:27.439
This is where
the rubber tree
hits the road!

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:30.273
Rod! Elspeth!
To the Ferkel!

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:40.114
Whoo!

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.759
Whoo!

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.792
I'd call this a face off,
if I had a face.

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:49.873
I'm going to smush you
like a bug.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.271
You throw like an alien.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.158
Huh? Huh?

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.159
Incoming!

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.673
Cling on tight, Rod!

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.956
Phil, are you there?

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.269
Ready to put my petals
to the metal.

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:17.999
Phil, steady the ship!

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.037
I'm about to put
the you-know-what
in the you-know-where.

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.996
You said it,
kind of, sort of.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.789
He can't!

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.795
I hate these people!

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.398
Rod, the hypertunnel's
trying to pull us in!

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.993
I can't hold this
position much longer!

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.152
Pudge-Boy.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.233
Stop right there.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.754
You of all people
can't trust
the Galactic Patrol.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.638
They've been lying to you.
What?

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:16.236
The truth about your father...
They'll never tell you,
but I will!

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:19.597
All you have to do
is put that down.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:23.036
Rod, close your earflaps.
That meatpod's the liar!

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.634
Why should I trust you
and not them?

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.870
I'm the only one
who can take you
to your father.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.434
Everything's gonna
be all right.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.509
Ow!

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.718
I'll come back, Rod.
I promise.

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:44.155
Simple choice, Allbright.
Yes, or no?

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.709
Dad...

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.551
Rod, you can't!

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.073
You know it's what
you want, Allbright.

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:58.236
It's not about me, Billy!
There's much more
at stake here!

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.035
I'm an Allbright.
I can do this.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:14.072
The Ferkel is go!

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.317
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:19.596
Eat my pollen,
hypertunnel!
Yes!

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:30.954
You did it!

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:35.279
Come on, Elspeth. We did it!
You flew straight at B'KR
to save the Ferkel!

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.998
Obviously!

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.638
Urn...

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.359
I don't think
we're done yet.

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.797
I'm going to blast
you all to quarks!

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.392
Nobody's going
to mow me down.

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.117
Flower Power!

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.593
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.072
Fasten your pod-belts!

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:23.469
I'll show this planet wrecker
some real fun with science.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.916
Saplings,
shield your light-sensing
jelly balls.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.639
"Jelly balls"?
I think he means our eyes.

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:30.959
Now!

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.318
Dang it!

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.356
Time to pluck this weed.

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.593
Farewell, Ferkel!

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.750
Reflect on this, B'KR.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.318
Boogers!

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:04.678
Rod! Elspeth! Scanners say
the Activator's in B'KR's
science project.

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:06.591
You have to nip if
in the bud.
Huh?

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.595
I see it!

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.952
How much time
do we have left?

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:16.155
Three minutes and...

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:18.833
Who knows how many seconds?
Just hurry!

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:21.673
You have to shut it down.
What're you going to do?

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.392
I'm going
to shutdown Billy.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.630
Is that the lunch bell?

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.200
The gym's going to
be swarming with kids.

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:36.033
And swarming with
galactic criminals.

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.598
Phil, activate
the embiggener!

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.591
Just forme.
Here you grow!

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:43.835
Good one.

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.438
Whoa. You got big.

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.714
Quit it, Pudge-Boy.

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.995
My name is Rod Allbright!

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.355
The sprout is blossoming.

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:26.556
Elspeth,
pull the blue wires.
Pull them all!

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:31.590
You're ruining everything.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.397
Now, you know how it feels!

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.675
Go, Rod!

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:41.599
Rod, the galactic criminals
are almost here.

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.871
Let's see you all
laugh at this, losers.

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.315
What?

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.913
All those brave bananas
just got creamed.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:40.714
The volcano?
The kid's a blooming genius.

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:55.756
Elspeth!
One minute and counting.

01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.159
Rod! IngredientZ!

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:06.033
This is the big one!

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:07.793
Hey, Rod Allbright.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:12.111
Yourworld is mine.

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:17.116
I don't like
the sound of that,
and I don't have ears.

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:21.194
The galactic criminals
are almost here!

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.958
Ten seconds.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:37.838
Nine, eight, seven, six,

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:45.559
five, four, three,

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.437
two,

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:48.914
one!

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.558
No!

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:53.870
Elspeth, no time left.
Pull everything!

01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.473
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:04.033
Whoo! I'm tired.
I need fertilizer.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.275
Time to make like
a tree and leaf.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:23.999
Fart burps!

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:37.314
I saw everything.

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:42.037
Everything?
Yeah, it was
the best volcano ever!

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:47.351
Hey, where's Billy?
Gone.

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.476
He won't be showing
his face around here again.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.915
Just like his father.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:11.914
I'll get a mop.
Yeah.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:11.637
This parting is sad
for me, Young Allbright,

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:14.791
but I honor
the Warrior Spirit
within you and Elspeth,

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:17.234
and wish you could
travel the stars with us.

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:20.073
Thank you, Tar Gibbons.
We've learned a lot
from you already.

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.071
At least half of it
makes sense.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:24.116
Let us hope
it is the right half.

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.634
Oh, I don't want
to get all sappy,

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:28.915
but even though
you're not green,

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:33.311
you two are
fine human beans...
Uh, beings.

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.435
Plink!

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.993
Rod, do you know why B'KR
told you that he knows
where yourfather is?

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.353
To be cruel.

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:46.275
True, but what is also true,
is there is no way
for B'KR to know

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:50.068
where yourfather is,
because his location
and his mission...

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:51.718
Are classified?

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.472
You mean
Rod's father is a...

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:55.671
A member of
the Galactic Patrol.

01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:00.517
Is that why I knew how
to get the Hydrocoptic
Marzul Vane to work?

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:05.592
Your father might have
transferred more knowledge
to you than...

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.711
I've already said too much.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.358
Take heart,
young Allbright.

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:16.079
Yourfather
would not have left
without good reason.

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:21.116
There's always
a seed of hope. Perhaps
you'll see him again...

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:24.079
But only when
the time is right.

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:28.076
When the galaxy
is safe once again.

01:23:58.240 --> 01:23:59.878
You think we'll ever
see them again?

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:01.233
I hope so.
Me, too.

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:02.719
We're part of
the team now, right?

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:03.835
Right.

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:05.592
But we still need
to have that talk.

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:08.075
Huh?
Star Wars.

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.308
Star Trek.

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:12.596
The Force beats
the Federation any day.

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:15.637
The Klingons beat
the Rebel Alliance
any day.

01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:17.949
Warrior Science says
this isn't over.

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.678
Until it's over.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.910
Hey! Guys!
Did you see that?

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:24.912
You mean that flash
of purple light?
Yeah, what was that?

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:31.277
The Starship Ferkel.
Part of the Galactic Patrol.

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:35.193
Its crew are all aliens.
Its pilot is a potted plant.

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:40.318
You guys!
I almost believed you
that time.

01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.517
There's always next time.

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:51.795
You were joking
about those little aliens,
right?

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.392
That's classified.

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:23.077
"And Billy Becker was banned
from this dimension
for 50 keltrons,

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:28.313
"stuck in a galactic prison
with no hope of getting out."

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.994
Or maybe I did.
