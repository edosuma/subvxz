have been better?

00:05.739 --> 00:07.641
You answering your phone.

My phone was tripping, I...

00:09.610 --> 00:11.445

I didn't get your call.

you were in three places at

00:17.485 --> 00:18.586

00:18.619 --> 00:21.122
Yeah, and they answered.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.392

that the company is not
going anywhere.

five years old

07:31.752 --> 07:33.386
and he asked for a cat.

07:33.420 --> 07:34.922
I told him I was allergic.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.925
So he had to choose
between me or the cat.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.426

Thanks for trying, man.

Listen, if it's any consolation,
I got a friend, needs some
pictures for an album cover.

09:46.854 --> 09:49.022
Told him about you,
he's like an indie artist.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.190
He wants to do
a session with you.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.892
Yeah, that sounds sick.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.027
Yeah, I could definitely
use the work.

to shoot today.

2:00 PM.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.232
Okay great.

to get my workout session in.

10:01.902 --> 10:02.703
What gym?

10:02.736 --> 10:04.237
Oh no, no gym.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.907
Um, I do a strenuous
yoga practice
in Piedmont Park.

10:07.407 --> 10:10.210
It's mostly for children,
but they accept a couple adults.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.913
Alright, listen don't overdo it,
alright?

10:16.583 --> 10:17.250

This is where
you're gonna do your shoot.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.441
You're gonna like the artist,
I wanna introduce you, come on.

10:41.742 --> 10:42.442
Huh.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.378
His music is dope.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.614
Yeah, really dope.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.250
Yo, Keith,
what's up man?

10:50.650 --> 10:53.120
Omar, what are you doing here?

10:53.153 --> 10:54.221
You didn't know?

10:54.254 --> 10:56.356
You about to do
my new album cover.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.425
Okay, now I'm confused,
what's happening?

10:58.458 --> 11:02.062
We know you wanted a
three month lease,
and they didn't allow it.

11:02.896 --> 11:07.901
But we were able to get you
a six month lease paid in full
by a very generous donor.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.971
Now here are the keys
to your new photo gallery!

11:11.471 --> 11:14.607
- Aye!
- Bro.

11:14.641 --> 11:15.575
Are you serious?

11:15.608 --> 11:16.710
This is a joke, right?

11:16.744 --> 11:17.644
- No!
- [Jarvis] No!

11:19.179 --> 11:20.714
Who's the donor?

11:20.748 --> 11:23.150
It's actually an old client
of mine: Quantavius Washington!

11:23.817 --> 11:25.953
He's an avid art
and photo collector.

11:25.986 --> 11:32.359
In fact, he wants to video chat,
holler at you right now.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.328
Alright yeah,
I'll holler, please.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.463
[Washington] Hello chap.

11:38.098 --> 11:41.935
Hey Quantavius, so
nice to meet you. Thank you,
thank you, thank you so much!

11:41.969 --> 11:43.370
(in British accent)
[Washington] Oh don't mention
it lad.

11:45.172 --> 11:48.842
You know, I know talent when
I see it, and when Jarvis
contacted me on your behalf--

11:48.876 --> 11:50.110
Wait, wait, wait
hold on, Quantavius?

11:50.677 --> 11:52.145
What's up with the accent, bruh?

11:52.179 --> 11:54.181
You're from Inglewood.

11:54.514 --> 11:58.886
Well you know me man,
I'm so well traveled
sometimes I get beside myself.

11:59.853 --> 12:03.757
Keith, I think you got a great
eye and I just wanted to
pay things forward.

12:03.791 --> 12:07.160
So I put the entire six months
on my rush card.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.196
Well thank you so much man.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.498
That means a lot coming from
such a distinguished
and traveled guy like yourself.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.133
[Washington] I'm just glad
it didn't get declined.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.971
Now there is one condition.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.341
Uh, I forgot to mention that
there is a condition.

12:21.374 --> 12:24.711
[Washington] The weather is
just too damn nice
out here in L.A.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.614
- so I won't make it down there.
- Okay.

12:27.647 --> 12:32.385
But I need you to showcase
a bit of that Quantaviusness
in your gallery.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.221
Okay, uh how?

12:34.254 --> 12:39.726
Well, he overnighted this.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.062
- [Washington] That's me
right there.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.197
Yeah, I can see that!

12:44.231 --> 12:46.900
[Washington] You know, I'm
just trying to make a name for
myself in the art world,

12:47.167 --> 12:51.404
so if you hang that
front and center, we're even.

12:51.738 --> 12:54.641
Of course, it is the least
I can do, thank you!

12:54.674 --> 12:56.676
Thank you so much, thank you!

12:57.244 --> 12:58.846
Alright then, I got to go guys.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.013
Arigato.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.248
Arrivederci.

13:01.581 --> 13:02.983
I'll holler!

13:03.016 --> 13:04.918
Alright, holler!

13:05.385 --> 13:07.888
You know what, I uh,
give me just a second guys,
thank you.

13:08.255 --> 13:09.823
- [Omar] Where he going?
- He just threw up
he peace sign?

13:09.857 --> 13:11.358
Yes he did.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.995
Oh I know he did not just do
the Ralph Macchio karate kick.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.330
- That's your boy.
- No it's, no it's, no
it's your boy.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.266
- He learned that from you.
- No he didn't, he learned
that--

13:19.900 --> 13:22.870
[Instrumental Hip-Hop Beat]

13:30.543 --> 13:31.678
Hey, babe.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.546
Hey, what you doing?

13:34.381 --> 13:35.782
Nothing, just,

13:36.383 --> 13:37.517
paying some bills!

13:37.550 --> 13:38.351
Okay.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.686
How was the gym?

13:39.719 --> 13:41.221
Oh, it was good.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.891
[Greg Sighs]

13:47.227 --> 13:52.299
I uh, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.367
Oh, should I be recording this?

13:54.401 --> 13:55.903
- Wait, babe, let me
go get your--
- No, no, no, no, babe, no!

13:55.936 --> 13:57.470
Hey, no.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.205
Please.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.639
Okay.

14:05.412 --> 14:09.782
The ring, it wasn't for you.

14:09.816 --> 14:12.819
So, who the hell
was it for then?

14:17.190 --> 14:24.664
Last night, I had dinner
with my ex.

14:24.932 --> 14:25.865
What?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.535
Sorry-ana?

14:28.835 --> 14:30.603
- Ariana.
- Okay Greg, don't
take up for her.

14:30.637 --> 14:31.504
I'm, I'm not!

14:31.771 --> 14:34.507
- Did you two?
- No!

14:34.807 --> 14:36.009
And?

14:37.810 --> 14:41.214
We were engaged,
for a short period of time.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.450
And she kept the ring.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.587
Until last night.

14:47.620 --> 14:51.658
So hold on,
you were engaged?

14:52.459 --> 14:55.996
You had dinner with your
ex-fiancé?

14:59.499 --> 15:01.301
The ring wasn't for me?

15:02.802 --> 15:05.472
Yes, yes and no.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.475
Oh my God, Greg,
why lie to me?

15:08.508 --> 15:09.709
I didn't lie to you!

15:09.742 --> 15:11.778
I just left out some
minor details.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.680
Like you were engaged?

15:14.314 --> 15:15.949
Why didn't you just tell me?

15:15.983 --> 15:18.651
I, Serena, I couldn't.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.454
(stuttering)
I, I didn't...

15:21.488 --> 15:23.756
I didn't want things to change
between us.

15:24.691 --> 15:28.695
You never moved in or wanted
to commit because you still had
feelings for your ex.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.365
(whispering)
Oh my God.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.468
I was just a rebound to you.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.504
No, you are not a rebound.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.672
So what do you call it then?

15:42.009 --> 15:42.942
You're right.

15:45.845 --> 15:50.783
At the time, I wasn't ready
for a relationship.

15:51.851 --> 15:52.952
Wow.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.389
I can admit that,
I was, I was hurt.

15:57.524 --> 15:58.891
[Greg] I was angry.

16:02.929 --> 16:04.531
But then I met you.

16:06.799 --> 16:11.138
And I just, I couldn't pass up
the opportunity to get
to know you.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.873
You are my world, Serena.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.876
I had dinner with my ex...

16:18.945 --> 16:20.113
because I needed closure.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.319
Did you get it?

16:28.588 --> 16:29.422
Yeah.

16:31.891 --> 16:35.262
Yeah, I think I did.

16:37.797 --> 16:38.798
Great.

16:41.568 --> 16:42.402
Me too.

16:51.911 --> 16:56.616
I'd like my key back
and for you to leave.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.153
Serena, Serena don't,
don't do that.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.490
Are you serious?

17:07.427 --> 17:08.728
You know I'm renting
my place out on--

17:08.761 --> 17:10.663
(yelling)
Okay, well rent it back to
yourself!

17:16.002 --> 17:16.936
Okay.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.410
* Maybe time was against us

17:23.443 --> 17:25.745
* Maybe we were just different

17:25.778 --> 17:27.747
* Maybe I needed patience

17:27.780 --> 17:30.783
* Maybe you should've listened
to me

17:31.484 --> 17:33.586
* Sometimes

17:33.620 --> 17:37.757
* Tired times

17:37.790 --> 17:39.659
* Maybe we didn't want it

17:39.692 --> 17:41.628
* Not unless it was perfect

17:41.661 --> 17:43.430
* But anything worth having

17:43.463 --> 17:47.467
* Gotta put a little work in
sometimes

17:52.739 --> 17:55.375
* So don't just let go

17:56.643 --> 17:59.246
* I think we should
give it one more try

17:59.479 --> 18:00.547
[Labored Breathing]

18:01.881 --> 18:03.983
[Omar] Look a little different,
thinking he somebody.

18:04.016 --> 18:07.187
How does it feel
Mr. gallery owner?

18:07.220 --> 18:09.322
- [Keith] My God.
- [Greg] Yo.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.391
I'm still in disbelief
you guys, like,

18:11.424 --> 18:13.226
I don't know how I'm ever
gonna repay you.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.427
Buy the next round.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.663
- Oh really, for everybody?
- Yes!

18:16.696 --> 18:18.498
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

18:18.531 --> 18:19.899
I'm just saying,
the way that my checking and
banking account is set up.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.068
- [All] Oh!
- I'm playing, I'm playing.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.736
Hey, hey, let's get
another round for everybody.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.906
I would've loved to have seen it
but I didn't get an invite.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.510
How about this?

18:30.543 --> 18:32.912
Let's swing by in the next
few days and check it out.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.381
[Greg] You got it.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.616
Uh, fellas, I have to take this,
I'll be back.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.221
[Keith] What kind of daiquiris
do you guys make?

18:42.622 --> 18:44.857
Hey, Robin, what's up?

18:44.891 --> 18:47.260
Hey, it sounds like you're
out and about.

18:47.294 --> 18:50.297
Yeah, just out having a couple
of drinks with some friends.

18:50.563 --> 18:51.864
Hey, just giving you a heads up,

18:52.131 --> 18:55.034
I just received confirmation
that Naomi will use the incident

18:55.067 --> 18:56.936
from your son's game
at court tomorrow.

18:56.969 --> 19:00.106
And of course they sent it
in the 11th hour
to try to catch us off guard.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.409
Robin, she is foul for this.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.043
What do we do now?

19:04.076 --> 19:06.879
I mean now she's trying
to paint me as this
angry black man.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.916
Now remember, I know
the importance of a father
being in their child's life.

19:10.317 --> 19:11.818
So we will do our best.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.787
But you know what would help?

19:16.088 --> 19:17.757
A character's letter.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.092
Have you been attending
those Anger Management classes?

19:20.126 --> 19:22.262
Yeah, yeah actually I have.

19:23.430 --> 19:24.797
You know, I'm really cool
with the teacher.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.098
Maybe I could call in a favor.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.400
Sounds good.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.735
Oh and Omar?

19:29.302 --> 19:30.737
Be careful tonight.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.305
Need you there bright and early.

19:32.605 --> 19:35.475
Robin, listen, I'm gonna
take off soon, alright?

19:35.508 --> 19:36.776
- Okay.
- [Omar] Thank you.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.584
Okay, okay, here's another one.

19:44.617 --> 19:45.752
She just posted this one.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.454
Alright, let me see it.

19:47.487 --> 19:51.123
"It's better to keep the peace
if your name ain't
on the lease".

19:51.157 --> 19:53.159
That's actually not that bad.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.127
She's throwing shots, right?

19:55.161 --> 19:57.397
Well think about it this way.

19:57.430 --> 20:02.134
Now you don't have to get her
Christmas gifts, a Valentine's
day, or none of that, right?

20:02.635 --> 20:04.170
I mean what's the alternative?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.772
You could always stay with me
for a while?

20:05.805 --> 20:07.640
You wanna do that,
you wanna be roommates?

20:07.674 --> 20:09.476
I'm gonna kick the couple
out of my Airbnb,
that's what I'm gonna do.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.110
Is that even legal?

20:11.143 --> 20:13.346
Jarvis, I haven't read
the fine print,
but they gots to go man.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.481
That's a family.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.483
[Omar] What're you
guys looking at?

20:16.516 --> 20:17.617
Subliminals.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.519
Serena's posting them
on social media.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.654
Oh, she's in the subliminal
phase.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.523
- [Greg] Oh, she going in.
- I see.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.691
Did she cut her hair?

20:24.724 --> 20:26.693
Nah, nah, nah,
she still got the braids.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.995
Oh, okay, well you guys
should be fine.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.162
How so?

20:30.196 --> 20:31.864
The moment a woman cuts her hair
it's over.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.000
Okay.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.002
Omar,

20:38.037 --> 20:39.005
is everything okay?

20:40.072 --> 20:42.008
Look, men and women are just
a different species.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.512
The double standards exist,
I get that.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.580
They always have
and they always will.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.552
I guess it's just
something we have to deal with.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.555
You nervous about
court tomorrow?

20:57.056 --> 20:58.224
It's gone work out, man.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.226
Yeah bro, we got you.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.995
[Jimmy] I'll take a Pilsner.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.768
Well, well, well, lookee here.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.270
If it ain't the teacher's pet.

21:12.439 --> 21:16.275
You know, you had a whole lot
to say earlier back
at that meeting.

21:17.577 --> 21:22.615
Now, you don't have
miss plain Jane
to hide behind, do you?

21:23.115 --> 21:24.984
Omar, who is this clown, man?

21:25.017 --> 21:26.753
- Yeah, Omar, who's your buddy?
- He ain't nobody.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.221
Aye, how you doing, man?
I'm Keith.

21:29.255 --> 21:31.858
[Jarvis] What you wanna do, O?

21:32.692 --> 21:36.763
You know, I don't appreciate
your arrogance in our class.

21:37.964 --> 21:40.733
Ain't enough room for the two
of us in there and you know it!

21:40.767 --> 21:43.069
(echoing)
Yo, Omar, just say the word man.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.604
(echoing)
[Robin] Omar be careful tonight.

21:44.637 --> 21:45.738
