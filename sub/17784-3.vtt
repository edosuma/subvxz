WEBVTT

00:28.296 --> 00:29.563
All right, all right.

00:31.999 --> 00:34.135
**

00:34.202 --> 00:38.005
* It don't matter to me *

00:38.072 --> 00:41.442
* If you take up with someone *

00:41.509 --> 00:44.412
* Who's better than me *

00:44.478 --> 00:49.049
* 'Cause your happiness is
all I want *

00:49.117 --> 00:52.553
* For you to find *

00:54.488 --> 00:56.790
* Your piece of mind *

00:59.460 --> 01:01.629
* It don't matter to me *

01:05.366 --> 01:08.469
* It don't matter to me *

01:08.536 --> 01:13.040
* 'Cause there'll always be
an empty room *

01:13.141 --> 01:16.810
* Waiting for you *

01:16.877 --> 01:18.412
* An open heart... *

01:18.479 --> 01:20.781
Honey, you want some bacon?

01:20.848 --> 01:24.952
It's not actually bacon.
It's this stuff, Sizzlean,

01:25.018 --> 01:27.388
that my doctor wants me to eat.

01:27.455 --> 01:30.858
I wonder if it's kosher.
No, it's not.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.993
* 'Cause it don't matter
to me *

01:33.060 --> 01:35.929
It's not kosher. It's, uh--
Pork is the first ingredient.

01:35.996 --> 01:39.500
Dude, fuck NYU.
You don't need them.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.935
Plenty of cool directors
never went to film school,

01:42.002 --> 01:45.273
like Kubrick and, um--

01:45.339 --> 01:47.208
- Kurosawa.
- Exactly.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.009
- And that's just the K's.
- Mm-hmm.

01:49.076 --> 01:51.412
I don't know, I can't help
thinking maybe it's a sign,

01:51.479 --> 01:53.647
like I'm wasting my time,
fooling myself.

01:53.714 --> 01:56.083
I mean, let's face it,
just 'cause I like movies

01:56.184 --> 01:58.786
and screwing around
with video cameras and Super-8
doesn't make me Spielberg.

01:58.852 --> 02:01.722
Maybe it's time
I face facts and move on
like you have with Misty.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.326
I didn't really
have a choice.

02:05.393 --> 02:08.028
Still.

02:08.095 --> 02:10.864
Man, our lives
really suck balls.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.269
All right, I gotta get going.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.070
What are you wearing?

02:17.205 --> 02:19.039
Figured it would help me
get into character.

02:19.106 --> 02:21.275
I shaved three times
this morning.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.447
Shit. Sorry, dude.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.783
Do you ever regret
dropping out of college?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.685
Sometimes.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.522
I mean, if I hadn't,
Misty would probably
respect me more now.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.757
Then again, I probably wouldn't
be working at Red Oaks,

02:36.824 --> 02:39.393
and she and I wouldn't
have become friends
in the first place.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.630
Wish me luck.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.014
Next.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.250
Sorry.

03:02.316 --> 03:05.353
- Name.
- Levine, Zachary.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.921
Registration and I.D.,
please.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.634
It says here
you weigh 145 pounds.

03:20.701 --> 03:24.505
Yeah, I'm a big stress eater.

03:27.475 --> 03:28.809
Next.

03:32.145 --> 03:33.447
Name.

03:33.514 --> 03:36.350
I've got to give you credit,
boychick.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.552
Most of my assistants
over the years

03:38.619 --> 03:40.488
have been young men
of limited ambition

03:40.554 --> 03:42.390
who were content to set
their romantic sights

03:42.456 --> 03:45.092
on lowly maids
and massage therapists.

03:45.158 --> 03:46.994
But not you. No.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.563
You went and bagged
the president's daughter.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.699
- It's not like that.
- Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.901
Don't apologize.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.303
It's inspiring.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.737
In fact,
it's made me realize

03:56.804 --> 03:58.372
I've been setting
my own sights too low.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.708
I deserve to be with
a higher class of woman,

04:00.774 --> 04:02.610
a woman of culture
and refinement,

04:02.676 --> 04:04.845
one who appreciates me
not only for my athleticism

04:04.912 --> 04:07.481
and brooding good looks,
but for what's in here.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.450
Aha.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.520
Top of the morning to you,
Mr. Getty.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.988
- I wanna hit!
- Okay, just wait here
and I'll--

04:15.055 --> 04:16.824
Not with you!

04:20.361 --> 04:21.862
I'll get my racquet.

04:25.333 --> 04:26.767
Next time you pick up
my daughter,

04:26.834 --> 04:29.069
I appreciate if you have
the courtesy to come inside.

04:29.136 --> 04:32.640
Don't just sit in the car
honking like a fucking
airport shuttle.

04:32.706 --> 04:35.876
- Sorry.
- It's called showing respect.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.445
Yes, sir.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.347
And bring her home
at a decent hour.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.349
What's a decent hour?

04:42.716 --> 04:43.984
Midnight.

04:44.051 --> 04:47.355
Isn't that kind of early?
I mean, she's 21.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.590
Midnight.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.662
Shall we? All right.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.399
David, if you would clear
the court, please.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.468
Forehand or backhand today,
sir?

05:07.007 --> 05:09.710
Oh, I think you're
gonna like this one.

05:14.081 --> 05:17.117
Mmm. Oh!

05:17.184 --> 05:19.787
- Hi, Herb.
- Hey, kid.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.623
- How's school?
- I didn't get in
the program I wanted,

05:22.690 --> 05:24.257
so I'm kind of taking a break.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.893
Smart. Pace yourself.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.862
You got your whole life
to make good decisions.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.832
I gotta go teach a lesson.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.775
Dude, how'd it go?

05:41.842 --> 05:43.677
It was fine.

05:43.744 --> 05:47.180
- Nobody was suspicious?
- Nope.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.650
Thanks, man.
You saved my life.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.021
Wait. I have something
for you, too.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.191
- What's this?
- Faulkner.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.427
"The Sound and the Fury."

05:59.493 --> 06:01.094
Tough read,
but totally worth it.

06:01.161 --> 06:04.097
It'll do more to build your
vocab and reading comprehension

06:04.164 --> 06:05.433
than any stupid SAT book.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.167
- Thanks, Wheeler.
- Hey.

06:07.234 --> 06:10.070
Come across any words
you don't know, come find me.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.674
I gotta go run this
out to the pool.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.042
- Need anything else?
- No.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.076
Oh...

06:20.548 --> 06:21.849
Here you go, Mrs. Getty.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.751
- Enjoy.
- Thank you, Wilder.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.719
- It's Wheeler.
- It's Wheeler, ma'am.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.888
- Whatever.
- It's a little early in the day

06:27.955 --> 06:29.657
for happy hour,
don't you think?

06:34.061 --> 06:37.598
- What?
- I just need
your account number, sir.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.968
- Really?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.771
I'm new to this job.
I'm sure I'll have it
memorized soon.

06:43.837 --> 06:47.608
- It's 418.
- Thank you, sir.

06:47.675 --> 06:49.610
Jesus Christ.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.513
You know, it wouldn't kill you
to be nicer to people.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.615
- What people?
- She means the help.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.484
She's concerned
for their wellbeing

06:56.517 --> 06:58.351
now that she's dating one.

06:58.486 --> 06:59.820
Why should I be nice to them?

06:59.887 --> 07:01.889
- Karma.
- Karma.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.492
Yeah. You know,
the Hindu concept?

07:04.558 --> 07:06.359
I tip them
so I don't have to be nice.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.028
That's the American concept.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.932
How about out you give
your lungs a break, huh?

07:11.999 --> 07:15.402
- You smoke.
- Cigars don't count.

07:15.503 --> 07:16.937
Why not?

07:17.004 --> 07:19.540
Because they don't give you
lung cancer.

07:19.607 --> 07:22.042
No, just mouth cancer.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.845
- So that's fine.
- That's not a real thing.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.547
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

07:26.614 --> 07:29.750
- Name one person who's
ever died of mouth cancer.
- Sigmund Freud.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.118
It wasn't cigars
that killed that guy.

07:31.184 --> 07:34.021
It was a dirty mind.

07:34.087 --> 07:37.157
Seriously, sweetie,
I really don't like you smoking.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.595
That's too bad.
I'm a grown woman.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.196
I did it all the time in Paris.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.165
Well, this isn't Paris.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.735
I'm going for a swim.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.803
Two weeks.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.339
She's home two weeks,
and already you're
at each other's throat.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.074
You both drive me crazy.

08:24.905 --> 08:28.341
Hey, you're Misty, right?
Wheeler's friend?

08:28.408 --> 08:30.310
Yeah.

08:30.377 --> 08:31.845
I'm Skye.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.681
I know.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.288
I heard that you just
got back from Paris.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.591
Yeah, yeah, two weeks ago.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.425
How was it?

08:45.492 --> 08:48.128
It was amazing. Yeah.

08:48.195 --> 08:52.633
Wow. I better get back.
See you around.

08:58.772 --> 09:02.610
Wow. That's huge.
Are you sure?

09:02.676 --> 09:07.615
I just think my time
will be better spent

09:07.681 --> 09:10.684
in New York
focusing on painting...

09:10.751 --> 09:12.753
you know, instead of
sitting in a lecture hall

09:12.820 --> 09:15.155
at Sarah Lawrence.

09:15.222 --> 09:18.425
Well, at least one of us
will be living in the city.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.994
You'll come visit me.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.696
Yeah.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.634
What are you doing?

09:27.801 --> 09:29.637
- Cheering you up--
- Okay.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.340
It's not that hard.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.282
- Do you need to get that?
- No. No.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.654
Doesn't your dad have
an answering machine?

09:46.720 --> 09:49.322
- Or something?
- He hasn't unpacked it yet. No.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.994
Just get-- Just get the phone.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.163
Ow!

09:56.229 --> 09:59.299
Motherfuck.

10:00.734 --> 10:01.669
Hello?

10:01.735 --> 10:03.536
Hi, sweetie, it's Mom.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.305
- Hey, Mom.
- Are you okay?

10:05.372 --> 10:07.140
Why are you so out of breath?

10:07.207 --> 10:09.176
I hope you're not
developing asthma.
Because your uncle--

10:09.242 --> 10:11.679
Mom, I'm fine.
I don't have asthma.

10:11.745 --> 10:12.913
Well, that's a relief.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.848
So, do you wanna hear
some great news?

10:14.915 --> 10:16.449
Yeah, of course.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.151
I sold the Cranford property.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.921
That's great, Mom.
Congrats. That's great.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.489
Who would think
that newlyweds would wanna

10:22.555 --> 10:24.324
take on a money pit
like that,

10:24.391 --> 10:26.727
but apparently...

10:26.794 --> 10:30.230
he is very handy,
unlike your father.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.366
And, you know, really wants
to do the renovations himself?

10:35.402 --> 10:38.138
David, are you there?

10:38.205 --> 10:39.973
Yeah, Mom, can I call you back?
I'm kind of busy.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.642
Oh, yeah, sure.
I'll be up late.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.878
- Okay, cool.
- Wait! Don't go! Wait!

10:44.945 --> 10:48.015
Tomorrow is Father's Day.
So pick up a card for your dad.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.717
All right? Don't forget
like last year.

10:49.783 --> 10:50.918
Yup, I won't.
Father's day card.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.085
I got it. Cool. Bye.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.153
Good-bye.

11:30.758 --> 11:33.426
Shanti Yoga.

11:33.493 --> 11:36.764
Hi. This is Judy.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.431
Judy Myers.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.400
Judy!

11:40.467 --> 11:43.036
David, you're here?

11:43.103 --> 11:46.106
- Dad!
- Oh, jeez! Oh!
Skye, I'm sorry.

11:46.173 --> 11:47.374
I thought you were
going to the mall.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.842
I did, I did. I came back.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.812
- Where are you going?
- Home.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.247
- No, wait. Skye, don't.
- Is she decent?

11:54.314 --> 11:56.449
We can just chill
and watch a movie
or something.

11:56.516 --> 11:57.951
No, it's okay, all right?

11:58.018 --> 11:59.519
I should be getting home anyway.

11:59.586 --> 12:00.821
Okay.

12:03.590 --> 12:04.992
Oh, I almost forgot.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.360
- Can you do me a huge favor?
- Sure.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.530
Come to the Father's Day brunch
with my family tomorrow?

12:10.597 --> 12:13.233
- I don't think that's
a very good idea.
- Please.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.837
Please. My father will be
on his best behavior
if you're there.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.238
I doubt that.
He hates me.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.974
No, he doesn't.
He just pretends to.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.944
This could be
a good opportunity for him

12:24.011 --> 12:25.578
to get to know you better.

12:25.645 --> 12:29.282
I need to break the news
to them about leaving school,

12:29.349 --> 12:31.651
so I could really use you
there for moral support.

12:31.718 --> 12:35.188
- Moral support?
- Yeah.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.290
Please.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.559
Okay. Yeah.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.128
You're the best.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.898
Bye, Mr. Myers.

12:44.965 --> 12:48.101
Nice to see you, Skye,
even though I didn't
see anything.

12:52.705 --> 12:53.907
I'm sorry, kiddo.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.043
No, it's okay.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.011
We gotta come up
with some sort of a code

12:58.078 --> 13:00.613
for when one of us is
entertaining a lady friend,

13:00.680 --> 13:02.282
like a tube sock
on the doorknob.

13:02.349 --> 13:05.052
- That's a good idea.
- That's a good idea.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.923
- Anybody call while I was out?
- Just Mom.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.860
Oh, hey, do you wanna do
something for Father's Day?

13:12.893 --> 13:14.327
I gotta be at the club
during the day,

13:14.394 --> 13:16.029
but, you know, we could go out
for dinner, catch a movie.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.564
I got a better idea.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.432
What do say we stay home,
order some pizza,

13:19.499 --> 13:20.868
open some brewskis,

13:20.868 --> 13:23.570
and we take a walk down
memory lane?

13:23.636 --> 13:25.238
Where did you find those?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.407
In the attic of the house
when we were moving.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.944
And believe it or not,
the bulb on this old
projector, it still works.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.579
Huh? What do you say?

13:32.645 --> 13:35.115
Yeah, sure. Why not?

13:45.492 --> 13:47.794
Good morning.

13:47.895 --> 13:50.130
Rebecca.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.564
Doug.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.333
Oof. Witch.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.735
She always have the nose
in the air like that.

13:55.802 --> 13:58.972
Just because she got
her Masters from Bryn Mawr,

13:59.039 --> 14:00.540
she thinks her shit
don't stink.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.543
You know what, sweetie?
You could have done that, too.

14:03.610 --> 14:04.811
- Believe me.
- Yes.

14:04.912 --> 14:07.114
But I chose to put
my family first.

14:07.180 --> 14:11.184
Because you, my darling,
are a full-time job.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.586
Hi!

14:15.388 --> 14:18.691
- What's he doing here?
- I invited him.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.360
Happy Father's Day,
Mr. Getty.

14:22.395 --> 14:23.663
I need a mimosa.

14:23.730 --> 14:26.199
Hello. Please?

14:26.266 --> 14:28.936
- My wife needs a drink.
- Now.

14:32.072 --> 14:35.508
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:35.575 --> 14:38.278
So how'd you do on
your exam the other night?

14:39.646 --> 14:42.449
Well, no thanks to you,

14:42.515 --> 14:43.650
I got an "A".

14:43.716 --> 14:46.286
Congrats.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.656
Thanks.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.124
Hey, are we okay?

14:52.092 --> 14:54.494
Yeah. Fine.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.596
You positive?

14:56.663 --> 14:59.132
Totally.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.702
You're Wheeler, right?

15:02.769 --> 15:04.404
Yeah. Who's asking?

15:04.471 --> 15:06.673
My buddy Zach told me
you hooked him up yesterday.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.641
Think you could help me out?

15:10.243 --> 15:13.613
I don't know, man.
That was like a one-time thing.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.248
I'll pay double.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.986
Come find me in an hour
when I'm on my break,

15:19.019 --> 15:20.753
and we'll talk, all right?

15:20.820 --> 15:22.255
Righteous. Thank you.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.126
All right.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.261
Thought you said
you were done dealing.

15:28.328 --> 15:31.398
- I am.
- Then what was that about?

15:33.733 --> 15:35.668
That?

15:35.735 --> 15:37.704
You know, this kid, Zach,

15:37.770 --> 15:40.707
kind of paid me 200 bucks
to take his SATs for him.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.642
So, yeah.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.012
What? Wheeler--

15:45.045 --> 15:46.479
I was just trying
to help him out, all right?

15:46.546 --> 15:48.215
His dad was gonna send him
to military school.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.916
Wheeler, if you wanted
to help him,

15:50.017 --> 15:52.619
you would have tutored him,
so he could actually learn
something.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.858
You know, I bet a ton of these
kids would be interested

15:58.925 --> 16:00.727
in having you
as their SAT tutor,

16:00.793 --> 16:02.795
and their parents, too.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.764
You could make a killing.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.699
Yeah? Think?

16:09.636 --> 16:11.638
Happy Father's day
to you both.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.041
What a lovely pair,
father and daughter.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.808
Hey! They lifted
your suspensions.

16:15.875 --> 16:16.843
Welcome back.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.445
You, sir, owe me a rematch.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.713
Mrs. Horowitz,
how lovely to see you.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.315
Hello, Nasser.

16:22.382 --> 16:25.185
I don't believe you've met
my children, Noah and Jennifer.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.654
What?

16:27.720 --> 16:30.057
Very funny.
You almost had me going there.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.391
Who are they really?

16:31.458 --> 16:33.793
- My children.
- I refuse to believe it,

16:33.860 --> 16:36.729
unless, you, of course,
yourself were a child
bride of some sort,

16:36.796 --> 16:38.431
and that's none of my business.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.068
Oh, Nasser.

16:41.101 --> 16:44.504
Where is Dr. Horowitz
on this lovely day
for vetting fathers?

16:44.571 --> 16:47.574
- Oh, you haven't heard.
- Shalom?

16:47.640 --> 16:50.777
Oh, Rabbi Ken!
What are you doing at Red Oaks?

16:50.843 --> 16:52.179
I was just meeting
with the GM.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.447
I'm officiating at
a wedding here next weekend.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.083
Ken Kaplan.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.751
Rabbi Ken is one of our
oldest and dearest friends.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.188
This is Nasser,
Red Oaks' head tennis pro.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.423
- Nice to meet you, Nasser.
- Your Honor.

17:03.490 --> 17:06.726
My parents only wish
I had gone to law school.

17:09.196 --> 17:12.099
You have been in my thoughts
all morning.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.567
I know today
must be very difficult.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.837
But Dan would be happy
to see you all together,

17:17.904 --> 17:20.407
sitting in the sunshine,

17:20.473 --> 17:23.243
keeping him in your hearts.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.182
I thought you'd be happy.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.651
- Happy? Happy?
- Yeah.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.986
Lower your voice.
Everyone is staring.

17:34.121 --> 17:37.224
Show me a parent who's happy
when his daughter announces

17:37.290 --> 17:39.359
she's dropping out of college.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.827
I'm wasting my time
at Sarah Lawrence.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.163
Like, I need another class
on the Bronte sisters?

17:43.230 --> 17:46.133
No, if I want to be
a serious artist,

17:46.199 --> 17:49.136
I need to be in the city,
focusing on my painting.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.970
Jesus Christ.

17:51.037 --> 17:52.439
Think of the tuition
you'll be saving.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.475
Don't even pretend to give
a shit about saving me money,

17:55.542 --> 17:58.611
not after the credit card bills
you racked up in Paris.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.380
And I'll tell you
something else, young lady,

18:00.447 --> 18:02.282
you drop out of school,
you are on your own.

18:02.349 --> 18:03.950
You get no more
financial support from me.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.618
That's it.
The money is gone.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.920
- You're on your own.
- I'll get a job.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.656
Oh, really? Doing what?

18:09.722 --> 18:12.592
- Stripping.
- With those A-cups?

18:12.659 --> 18:15.262
Least she could have done
was inherit my boobs.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.164
You're acting like a child.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.299
Screw this.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.868
You have no idea how
the real world works!

18:21.934 --> 18:22.835
You have no idea!

18:22.902 --> 18:25.838
Thanks for brunch.

18:25.905 --> 18:28.375
- Unbelievable.
- I don't wanna make
a scene here, all right?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.177
Can we just keep it calm?
It'll be fine.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.844
Yes.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.346
Getty.

18:33.413 --> 18:36.383
Oh, Fienberg.
What do you want?

18:36.449 --> 18:38.017
Just to give you the heads-up

18:38.084 --> 18:40.687
before you hear
from somebody else,

18:40.753 --> 18:44.191
the board has asked me
to run for club president.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.460
Go fuck yourself.

19:04.211 --> 19:07.314
- He's impossible.
- Most dads are.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.216
Not like mine.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.584
I'm so fucking sick of him
trying to micromanage me

19:11.651 --> 19:14.821
like I'm one of his
goddamn employees.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.324
I swear to God, I should have
never come home from Paris.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.492
Well, I'm glad you did.

19:19.559 --> 19:20.793
Come here.

19:24.831 --> 19:29.236
I know the real reason...
he's trying to control me

19:29.302 --> 19:33.973
is because everything else in
his life is so out of control.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.575
But it doesn't make it
any easier.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.777
Yeah.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.247
How are you?

19:40.280 --> 19:43.816
Me? I'm fine.

19:43.883 --> 19:48.087
I mean with
the whole NYU thing.

19:48.154 --> 19:49.389
Oh, you know, not great.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.491
I realize I can always
apply again next year,

19:51.558 --> 19:53.960
but it doesn't make it
any easier.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.876
- David, I've got
the most wonderful news.
- What?

20:09.942 --> 20:13.145
- Dr. Horowitz died.
- What? When?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.214
- Last fall.
- That's awful.

20:15.282 --> 20:18.217
Serves him right.
He was playing racquetball
during the High Holidays.

20:18.285 --> 20:19.352
You're missing the point,
David.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.653
What point?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.522
Mrs. Horowitz is back
on the market.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.324
I thought you had a rule
against dating members' wives.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.293
Not their widows.

20:26.359 --> 20:29.262
Yes, and she's exactly
the kind of woman
I deserve to be with.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.299
Beautiful, cultured, rich.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.840
Hi!

20:40.907 --> 20:42.975
Wow! Amazing!

20:43.042 --> 20:44.577
How'd you do this so fast?

20:44.644 --> 20:46.679
I have a connection
in the business office.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.316
- Cool.
- Come on, let's put them up.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.983
- Right now?
- Yeah.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.719
- But--
- Let's go.

20:52.785 --> 20:53.920
All right. Cool.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.555
**

21:07.133 --> 21:08.568
Hi.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.069
I'm meeting a friend.

21:10.136 --> 21:14.040
She might already be here.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.876
Oh, there she is. Thanks.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.360
What are you doing here?

21:35.061 --> 21:36.062
I took a taxi.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.364
Are you okay?

21:37.430 --> 21:38.998
No.

21:39.065 --> 21:42.201
I can't spend another minute
in that house with them.

21:42.268 --> 21:44.737
- What are you gonna do?
- You know, just--

21:44.804 --> 21:48.575
just stay with Alex and Serge
in the city until I find
a place of my own.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.912
Can you give me a ride?

21:55.081 --> 21:56.416
Yeah, of course.

21:58.250 --> 22:01.421
Yeah, I didn't want
to tell you over the phone.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.656
- So how did this happen?
- Well, I--

22:03.723 --> 22:06.258
I always knew that I wanted
to be a mother.

22:06.393 --> 22:08.027
And I wasn't getting
any younger,

22:08.094 --> 22:09.596
so I asked my friend Ricky,

22:09.662 --> 22:11.398
who's in a similar situation,

22:11.431 --> 22:14.401
if he would ever consider
having a baby together.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.669
And here we are.

22:16.736 --> 22:19.305
- So you and he--
- Yeah.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.474
Yeah. Even though you're both--

22:21.541 --> 22:24.243
- Yep.
- Yeah.

22:24.310 --> 22:26.413
Oh. Hmm.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.080
Wasn't it kind of awkward?

22:28.147 --> 22:30.517
Um, at first, yeah.

22:30.583 --> 22:33.553
But, I mean,
so was sex with my husband,

22:33.620 --> 22:35.187
and I managed
to get through that.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.426
How about you?
How have you been?

22:39.492 --> 22:42.028
Oh. Good. Fine.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.831
I mean, you know,
it's been an adjustment,

22:44.897 --> 22:47.266
but everything--

22:47.333 --> 22:49.235
Overall,
everything's going well.

22:49.301 --> 22:51.037
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.972
Are you seeing anyone?

22:53.039 --> 22:54.206
No.

22:54.273 --> 22:56.108
You should.

22:56.175 --> 22:57.844
It's time to get back
out there.

22:57.910 --> 23:01.514
I kind of thought
that's what I was doing.

23:01.581 --> 23:04.116
Right.

23:06.519 --> 23:08.621
**

23:10.523 --> 23:12.859
Wheeler's right.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.861
Screw NYU.
You don't need them.

23:14.927 --> 23:16.563
- I guess.
- No, this--

23:16.629 --> 23:19.065
This idea that art is
something that can be taught

23:19.131 --> 23:20.767
is bullshit.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.536
You don't need to be sitting
in some classroom.

23:23.603 --> 23:26.372
You need to be out there
making short films,

23:26.473 --> 23:29.208
finding your voice,
meeting other artists.

23:29.275 --> 23:30.877
God, that's--

23:30.943 --> 23:33.780
That's why me moving here
is gonna be so great.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.948
- For both of us.
- Mm-hmm.

23:36.015 --> 23:38.785
Think you should check
if Serge and Alex are back yet?

23:38.851 --> 23:40.052
It's fine.
I left a note.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.991
Need anything?

23:45.057 --> 23:46.593
How about a job?

23:46.659 --> 23:48.928
Any experience?

23:50.229 --> 23:51.764
None whatsoever.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.804
Leave your number.
I'll make sure my manager
gets it.

23:57.870 --> 24:01.173
Okay, you're amazing.
That was amazing.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.208
That was so cool.

24:02.274 --> 24:06.713
Oh, my God! Skye!

24:06.779 --> 24:08.948
Hi.

24:10.382 --> 24:12.318
Got your message.
What the fuck are
you doing here?

24:12.384 --> 24:14.253
Looking for a place to crash.

24:14.320 --> 24:18.290
Just for a little while,
until I find my own place.

24:18.357 --> 24:21.661
- Hello... M--
- David.

24:21.728 --> 24:24.631
David, yes, of course.
How could I forget?

24:24.697 --> 24:28.668
- So are we gonna regret this?
- I already do.

24:28.735 --> 24:31.671
- Okay.
- Thank you, thank you.

24:31.738 --> 24:33.573
Thank you, thank you.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.043
I'll be right back.

24:43.382 --> 24:45.251
I wanna start a tab.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.554
We're celebrating!

24:51.724 --> 24:55.461
* Now we take our time *

24:55.562 --> 24:59.031
* So nonchalant *

24:59.098 --> 25:01.801
* And spend our nights *

25:01.868 --> 25:04.871
* So bon vivant *

25:04.937 --> 25:08.575
* We dress our days *

25:08.608 --> 25:11.210
* In silken robes *

25:11.277 --> 25:14.380
* The money comes *

25:14.446 --> 25:17.584
* The money goes *

25:17.617 --> 25:20.286
* We know it's all *

25:20.352 --> 25:24.591
* A passing phase *

25:26.158 --> 25:31.664
* But I've loved these days *

25:40.907 --> 25:45.812
* Now as we indulge *

25:45.878 --> 25:48.615
* In things refined *

25:48.681 --> 25:51.450
* We hide our hearts *

25:51.517 --> 25:54.654
* From harder times *

25:54.721 --> 25:57.890
* A string of pearls *

25:57.957 --> 26:00.860
* A foreign car *

26:00.927 --> 26:04.296
* Oh, we can only *

26:04.363 --> 26:07.634
* Go so far *

26:07.634 --> 26:10.436
* On caviar *

26:10.502 --> 26:14.006
* And cabernet *

26:19.946 --> 26:23.482
* We drown our doubts *

26:23.549 --> 26:26.118
* In dry champagne *

26:26.185 --> 26:29.488
* And soothe our souls *

26:29.555 --> 26:32.524
* With fine cocaine *

26:32.659 --> 26:35.662
* I don't know why *

26:35.695 --> 26:38.564
* I even care *

26:38.665 --> 26:41.467
* We'll get so high *

26:41.533 --> 26:44.904
* And get nowhere *

26:44.971 --> 26:47.907
* We'll have to change *

26:47.974 --> 26:52.078
* Our jaded ways *
