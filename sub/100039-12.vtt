WEBVTT

00:04.416 --> 00:07.182
The human body
is a terrible liar.

00:07.206 --> 00:09.562
Whatever secrets it's keeping,

00:09.586 --> 00:13.062
it will tell them all
eventually.

00:12.876 --> 00:15.022
You back at work?

00:15.046 --> 00:17.102
- No.
- You gonna be?

00:17.126 --> 00:18.682
I had to meet with
Koracick to ask.

00:18.706 --> 00:20.312
He's not sure.

00:20.336 --> 00:21.642
Yeah, well, I guess
it was pretty sudden.

00:21.666 --> 00:24.102
You did kinda screw him.

00:24.126 --> 00:26.407
And we don't all have parents
who can clean up our messes.

00:28.166 --> 00:29.892
You coming tonight?

00:29.916 --> 00:31.352
Why wouldn't I be coming?

00:31.376 --> 00:32.892
Well, seeing as
you can't stand the sight of me,

00:32.916 --> 00:34.812
I thought maybe you'd skip it.

00:34.836 --> 00:38.182
Jackson, my opinion of you
has no effect on my plans.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.682
It's Richard and Catherine's
anniversary.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.812
I care about them.
I'm going.

00:41.836 --> 00:43.852
And you're clearly
in the mood to celebrate,

00:43.876 --> 00:46.472
so that's great.

00:46.496 --> 00:50.232
Leprosy, chicken pox,
tuberculosis, HIV...

00:50.256 --> 00:52.836
we can carry these for years
with no physical symptoms.

00:55.046 --> 00:56.562
I'm sorry you drove
all the way out here,

00:56.586 --> 00:58.472
but my answer is no.

00:58.496 --> 01:00.182
This isn't only your decision.

01:00.206 --> 01:01.812
And this dinner is ridiculous.

01:01.836 --> 01:03.352
We're giving them big news.

01:03.376 --> 01:04.471
It affects us all.

01:04.495 --> 01:05.892
Yeah, so we should just
tell them.

01:05.916 --> 01:07.182
Richard, I care about Maggie.

01:07.206 --> 01:08.642
I know you care about Jackson.

01:08.666 --> 01:10.892
This dinner is for them,
not for us.

01:10.916 --> 01:12.062
We're still gonna be a family,

01:12.086 --> 01:13.642
even if you and I
are separating.

01:13.666 --> 01:16.142
But given enough time,
the signs will always show up.

01:16.166 --> 01:18.392
Can't wait for this
damn night to be over.

01:18.416 --> 01:19.183
Hey.
Hi!

01:19.207 --> 01:20.642
Hey!
Hi, guys!

01:20.666 --> 01:22.472
Hi. Mwah. Hi.

01:22.496 --> 01:24.666
How you been? Mwah.

01:25.956 --> 01:27.432
So, u-um, all set for tonight?

01:27.456 --> 01:29.022
Hey, I'm making
blackberry cobbler.

01:29.046 --> 01:30.023
Ooh, my favorite.

01:30.047 --> 01:31.602
Yum!

01:31.626 --> 01:34.312
The real question is,
what are your body's secrets?

01:34.336 --> 01:37.182
So, um... see you soon.

01:37.206 --> 01:38.522
Oh, I can't wait.
Yeah, yeah.

01:38.546 --> 01:39.642
Alright, see you tonight.

01:39.666 --> 01:40.643
Okay.
Okay.

01:40.667 --> 01:41.852
See you tonight.

01:41.876 --> 01:43.756
And are you ready to know?

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.206 --> 02:01.522
I can reach for my own water.

02:01.546 --> 02:03.682
The hospital just wants me
to rest a few more weeks.

02:03.706 --> 02:05.996
There's nothing wrong with me
helping you with that.

02:11.416 --> 02:14.182
Now that...
that makes me feel better.

02:14.206 --> 02:16.182
Is everybody decent?

02:16.206 --> 02:18.392
Except for the ball gag
and jock strap, we're good.

02:18.416 --> 02:20.022
- Levi.
- What was that, honey?

02:20.046 --> 02:21.272
What do you need, Mom?

02:21.296 --> 02:22.602
Cousin Shirl just called

02:22.626 --> 02:24.812
to say that Mayda heard
that Great Uncle Saul

02:24.836 --> 02:27.272
is circling the drain
over at Olympia Meadows...

02:27.296 --> 02:28.732
"Circling the drain"?

02:28.756 --> 02:31.522
You couldn't say that like...
I don't know, like a person?

02:31.546 --> 02:33.472
If he had behaved
more like a person...

02:33.496 --> 02:35.142
other than with you...
then maybe.

02:35.166 --> 02:38.232
The point is, he's in hospice,

02:38.256 --> 02:40.142
so if you want to see him,
then...

02:40.166 --> 02:42.272
Now?

02:42.296 --> 02:43.892
A-A-As in now-now?

02:43.916 --> 02:46.182
As in, try not to get a ticket
speeding on the interstate.

02:46.206 --> 02:47.602
That's up to you.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.142
Bring a sweater, honey.

02:49.166 --> 02:50.546
Those places are like an icebox.

02:57.336 --> 02:59.046
You okay?

03:00.546 --> 03:04.682
Uncle Saul was an ass
to everyone else.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.272
I have no idea why,

03:06.296 --> 03:09.022
but it's like life gave him
45% of being a good man,

03:09.046 --> 03:11.376
and he spent it all on me.

03:17.756 --> 03:19.642
Happy anniversary, guys.

03:19.666 --> 03:22.272
Anniversary.
Um...

03:22.296 --> 03:25.142
I suppose it is
in a few days, isn't it?

03:25.166 --> 03:27.022
That's not why you invited us
over for dinner tonight?

03:27.046 --> 03:28.182
Not exactly.

03:28.206 --> 03:29.852
You know,
when you get to be our age,

03:29.876 --> 03:31.432
you stop counting, dear.

03:31.456 --> 03:33.182
- Here, give me this coat. 
- Yes. Here.

03:33.206 --> 03:37.022
So, um, a patient
turned me on to those.

03:37.046 --> 03:38.852
They are insane.
They're French.

03:38.876 --> 03:39.996
You shouldn't have.
Really.

03:42.876 --> 03:44.932
Is something wrong?
Oh, no.

03:44.956 --> 03:45.932
- Of course not.
- Okay.

03:45.956 --> 03:46.956
Mm-hmm.

03:47.956 --> 03:49.352
- Oh. Well...
- Oh.

03:49.376 --> 03:50.666
Alright.

03:52.836 --> 03:54.642
Happy anniversary.

03:54.666 --> 03:56.232
Oh, thank you.

03:56.256 --> 03:57.852
Um, more gifts.

03:57.876 --> 03:59.602
More... Wonderful.
Jackson,

03:59.626 --> 04:01.272
- is this an Alice Mann?
- Yes, it is.

04:01.296 --> 04:02.522
She only printed three of those.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.022
- Oh! - Sorry I didn't have
time to get it gift-wrapped.

04:04.046 --> 04:05.472
I literally just got it back
from the framer,

04:05.496 --> 04:07.852
and it took forever to get it
out of South Africa.

04:07.876 --> 04:09.852
Jackson, you are just...

04:09.876 --> 04:11.932
Mm.
...too much.

04:11.956 --> 04:13.812
South Africa.
Nice.

04:13.836 --> 04:16.232
Uh, is that a problem?

04:16.255 --> 04:17.351
No, I just wish I'd known

04:17.375 --> 04:18.772
you were bringing
something so expensive.

04:18.796 --> 04:20.062
I brought chocolates.

04:20.086 --> 04:21.522
Oh, well,
who doesn't love chocolate?

04:21.546 --> 04:23.142
I love chocolate.

04:23.166 --> 04:24.966
Come on, Maggie.
Let's go have some chocolate.

04:30.256 --> 04:31.472
Don't like it?

04:31.496 --> 04:33.682
Oh, no, no.
It's beautiful.

04:33.706 --> 04:35.272
Uh, she's mom's favorite,

04:35.296 --> 04:37.182
and I figured you guys have
similar taste.

04:37.206 --> 04:38.602
You know, I could
help you find a spot

04:38.626 --> 04:39.603
to hang it up if you want.

04:39.627 --> 04:42.772
Um, n-n-n-not yet.
Um...

04:42.796 --> 04:45.126
Come on in.
Sure, yeah.

04:52.126 --> 04:54.932
Dinner should be ready shortly.

04:54.956 --> 04:57.142
Um, we wanted to talk about...

04:57.166 --> 04:59.812
I wonder, who would like
a glass of wine?

04:59.836 --> 05:01.642
I know I surely do.
Uh, heavy, please.

05:01.666 --> 05:02.603
Me, please.
Okay.

05:02.627 --> 05:05.472
Oh.

05:05.496 --> 05:09.682
So, Mom, they set an opening
for the hospital at Memphis?

05:09.706 --> 05:10.772
Early next month.

05:10.796 --> 05:12.182
So many hospitals.

05:12.206 --> 05:14.182
I do not know how
you keep track of them all.

05:14.206 --> 05:15.472
By never being at home.

05:15.496 --> 05:19.972
By hiring good people
who help me run things.

05:19.996 --> 05:21.852
Tom Koracick excluded, I guess.

05:21.876 --> 05:23.352
He's very good at what he does.

05:23.376 --> 05:25.852
You know, now that
we are all together,

05:25.876 --> 05:27.602
what we wanted to talk with you
...I think that we could really wait

05:27.626 --> 05:30.062
until we've all eaten, dear.

05:30.086 --> 05:33.046
I don't know if it
needs to wait, hon.

05:34.166 --> 05:36.642
What's wrong?

05:36.666 --> 05:38.432
- Did you get bad news?
- Oh, God no.

05:38.456 --> 05:40.062
My scans have come back great.

05:40.086 --> 05:43.256
Richard, you're terrifying them.

05:44.166 --> 05:46.022
Oh, that must be Vic.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.852
Who's Vic?
His girlfriend.

05:47.876 --> 05:49.642
I came from work,
so she's meeting me here.

05:49.666 --> 05:51.562
- But why?
- Good question.

05:51.586 --> 05:53.732
You invited your girlfriend
to our dinner?

05:53.756 --> 05:55.546
More, the merrier, right?

05:58.586 --> 05:59.852
Hello!

05:59.876 --> 06:01.086
Hey.

06:02.046 --> 06:04.602
Uh, you need a ride
or something?

06:04.626 --> 06:05.682
Oh, no, I invited him.

06:05.706 --> 06:06.732
That's okay, right?

06:06.756 --> 06:08.312
You said it's a party.

06:08.336 --> 06:09.392
Dinner... Dinner party.

06:09.416 --> 06:10.432
I said it was a dinner party.

06:10.456 --> 06:11.892
Didn't hear that part.
Mm-hmm.

06:11.916 --> 06:13.602
What did you do?

06:13.626 --> 06:14.642
Come on in, man.
Don't worry about it.

06:14.666 --> 06:15.732
Yeah?
Yeah. Welcome.

06:15.756 --> 06:16.996
Alright.

06:21.586 --> 06:23.062
Dean Miller.
Pleasure to meet you.

06:23.086 --> 06:24.812
Richard Webber.
Pleasure's mine.

06:24.836 --> 06:26.312
- Please, please, have a seat. 
- Hi.

06:26.336 --> 06:27.932
Richard, I want you to meet Vic.

06:27.956 --> 06:29.062
Oh, hello.

06:29.086 --> 06:30.182
It's so nice to meet you.

06:30.206 --> 06:31.522
Jackson's told me
so much about you.

06:31.546 --> 06:34.562
And I'm sure Mom's told you
plenty about Vic.

06:34.586 --> 06:36.432
Oh, yes, yeah.
Right?

06:36.456 --> 06:37.626
Yes.

06:39.046 --> 06:42.812
So, this is a really small
dinner party, huh?

06:42.836 --> 06:45.522
Well, it's a good thing
I made plenty of food.

06:45.546 --> 06:46.852
Um, Richard,

06:46.876 --> 06:49.142
would you mind giving me a hand
in the kitchen?

06:49.166 --> 06:51.046
I was just about to ask. Mm.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.852
I, uh, feel like we're crashing.

06:58.876 --> 06:59.932
No.

06:59.956 --> 07:02.182
Why would you think that?

07:02.206 --> 07:04.972
Well, you're not crashing...
at all, actually.

07:04.996 --> 07:07.432
Let me go ahead
and grab you some wine.

07:07.456 --> 07:08.876
See if Maggie's left us any.

07:20.756 --> 07:22.522
Uncle Saul.

07:22.546 --> 07:26.682
Boy, do you look like
a steaming pile of crap, kid.

07:26.706 --> 07:28.352
Same to you, Uncle Saul.

07:28.376 --> 07:30.432
Thought you were his favorite.

07:30.456 --> 07:32.182
Insults is how we show love.

07:32.206 --> 07:34.812
I'm assuming you're Levi,
the doctor.

07:34.836 --> 07:36.102
I've heard a lot about you.

07:36.126 --> 07:38.182
How is he?

07:38.206 --> 07:39.642
He's in end-stage heart failure,

07:39.666 --> 07:42.062
so we're doing our best
to keep him comfortable.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.892
Which, I've learned,
does not include

07:44.916 --> 07:47.562
an all-expense paid trip
to Maui.

07:47.586 --> 07:50.602
I'm afraid not, Saul, no.

07:50.626 --> 07:51.932
I'll come back
to check on you later.

07:51.956 --> 07:52.933
Meh.

07:52.957 --> 07:55.472
Thank you.

07:55.496 --> 07:57.206
Boychick.
Da.

07:59.336 --> 08:01.852
Mm.

08:01.876 --> 08:05.682
We had Shabbat
dinner last week... Ah.

08:05.706 --> 08:10.312
...and I snuck a few
hard-boiled eggs in my pocket,

08:10.336 --> 08:12.642
thinking you'd show up,

08:12.666 --> 08:14.602
but the nurse sniffed 'em out

08:14.626 --> 08:16.232
and trashed 'em.

08:16.256 --> 08:19.522
He always knew
they were my favorite.

08:19.546 --> 08:20.852
Where's Aunt Gertie?

08:20.876 --> 08:23.272
Eh, Gertie makes it
when she can.

08:23.296 --> 08:25.432
I tell her don't bother,
but she says,

08:25.456 --> 08:27.916
"That's what you do
for the man you love."

08:29.546 --> 08:32.142
Saul, this is Nico.
I wanted you to meet him...

08:32.166 --> 08:33.852
What's this I hear
about you living

08:33.876 --> 08:35.472
in your mother's basement?

08:35.496 --> 08:37.772
Ugh. I thought you
were a hot-shot doctor.

08:37.796 --> 08:39.522
I was hoping that

08:39.546 --> 08:40.932
we would iron a few things out

08:40.956 --> 08:43.102
before I just up and left.

08:43.126 --> 08:44.932
I hate to move out on bad terms.

08:44.956 --> 08:46.932
My nephew, King of Vague.

08:46.956 --> 08:50.272
Spill. I don't have time
to play guessing games.

08:50.296 --> 08:53.732
Mom learned some new
information about me,

08:53.756 --> 08:55.682
which was all well and good

08:55.706 --> 08:57.682
as long as I kept it in house.

08:57.706 --> 08:59.272
You think I'm getting on a roof

08:59.296 --> 09:01.892
with a bugle horn anytime soon?

09:01.916 --> 09:04.682
Excellent point.

09:04.706 --> 09:08.182
Well, Uncle Saul.

09:08.206 --> 09:11.812
Nico here is
more than my friend.

09:11.836 --> 09:14.562
H-He's my boyfriend.

09:14.586 --> 09:19.892
And he has been
for a while now, and...

09:19.916 --> 09:20.956
I love him.

09:22.836 --> 09:24.956
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

09:27.256 --> 09:29.796
Oh, God.
Dr. Marks!

09:43.586 --> 09:45.772
I killed him.

09:45.796 --> 09:47.586
I killed him with my gayness.

09:51.709 --> 09:54.485
Did you know they were
bringing dates to dinner?

09:54.509 --> 09:56.185
Of course not.

09:56.209 --> 09:57.605
Well, we can't tell them now.

09:57.629 --> 09:58.945
Yeah, well, if you'd have
listened to me,

09:58.969 --> 10:00.525
we'd have told them
without the fanfare.

10:00.549 --> 10:02.775
Well, it's too late for that.

10:02.799 --> 10:04.775
We'll just tell them later.

10:04.799 --> 10:08.275
Let's just get try to
get through tonight.

10:08.299 --> 10:10.315
Yep.

10:10.339 --> 10:11.879
I've gotten good at that.

10:17.049 --> 10:22.485
Um, any... any, uh, good, like,
calls, uh, recently?

10:22.509 --> 10:23.985
Something cool?

10:24.009 --> 10:28.605
Oh, there was a C.O.
buildup in the sewer yesterday.

10:28.629 --> 10:31.275
Shot some manhole covers
straight up in the air.

10:31.299 --> 10:33.815
It lifted 250 pounds of
cast iron like it was nothing.

10:33.839 --> 10:34.945
Wow.

10:34.969 --> 10:36.895
- Well, that is pretty cool.
- Yeah.

10:36.919 --> 10:39.235
I mean, it... it... it did
kill this woman's dad

10:39.259 --> 10:41.775
while they were shopping
for her wedding dress.

10:41.799 --> 10:43.129
So, there's that.

10:44.919 --> 10:47.185
I'm gonna go add
some more place settings,

10:47.209 --> 10:49.275
since there's
so many more of us.

10:49.299 --> 10:51.735
You know what,
I should... I should help.

10:51.759 --> 10:52.855
I'll... I'll be right back.

10:52.879 --> 10:54.709
Okay.

10:58.419 --> 10:59.759
Cool party.

11:02.589 --> 11:05.235
Should we grab a coffee?
Sandwich?

11:05.259 --> 11:07.105
Your aunt may not be
here for a while. I can't.

11:07.129 --> 11:10.105
Jewish tradition says
a friend or family member

11:10.129 --> 11:11.525
or designated shomer

11:11.549 --> 11:13.855
cannot leave the body
of a loved one unattended

11:13.879 --> 11:15.065
from the moment they die

11:15.089 --> 11:16.565
until they're buried
in the ground.

11:16.589 --> 11:19.025
Otherwise, their spirit
just sort of...

11:19.049 --> 11:21.985
like, lingers around, confused.

11:22.009 --> 11:23.449
You're getting that
off the Internet?

11:24.049 --> 11:26.605
It's tradition.

11:26.629 --> 11:28.025
And yes.

11:28.049 --> 11:29.685
I-I-I'm what they call
culturally Jewish.

11:29.709 --> 11:31.525
I, you know, eat the bagels

11:31.549 --> 11:33.275
and know the five big prayers,

11:33.299 --> 11:35.565
and went to first base with Shira
Levenstein at sleep-away camp.

11:35.589 --> 11:39.065
But this...
this I know.

11:39.089 --> 11:42.315
I am keeping Shemirah

11:42.339 --> 11:45.685
until the Chevra Kaddisha arrive
or my Aunt Gertie

11:45.709 --> 11:48.629
or, you know,
literally anyone else.

11:50.759 --> 11:52.395
And now I want a sandwich.

11:52.419 --> 11:53.735
Saul-y.

11:53.759 --> 11:55.565
I'm so sorry, Aunt Gertie.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.759
I... Hey.

12:13.759 --> 12:16.589
You look good, my boy.
Really good.

12:17.919 --> 12:20.145
I'm sorry you have to
see him this way.

12:20.169 --> 12:23.855
Gertie,
this is my f-friend Nico.

12:23.879 --> 12:24.879
Hi.

12:28.339 --> 12:30.775
W-Why aren't they
taking his body?

12:30.799 --> 12:32.685
Apparently, it's been
a big day here,

12:32.709 --> 12:35.105
so I've been watching him.

12:35.129 --> 12:36.895
But I understand that you'll
want to take over, so...

12:36.919 --> 12:37.945
Uh, I can't do that.

12:37.969 --> 12:39.685
Saul-y and I promised

12:39.709 --> 12:44.315
that when the end was the end,

12:44.339 --> 12:46.145
that was the end.

12:46.169 --> 12:47.919
The end of...?

12:52.709 --> 12:54.395
Hmm.

12:54.419 --> 12:56.089
He was a good man.

12:59.629 --> 13:01.509
Love you, buddy.

13:03.209 --> 13:06.879
And you are a good man, too,
you hear me?

13:08.669 --> 13:10.235
Um, are you going?

13:10.259 --> 13:12.815
D-Does that mean I-I'm supposed
to just stay here, or...?

13:12.839 --> 13:15.379
Oh.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.485
Did you really think I wouldn't
see how obvious this is?

13:19.509 --> 13:20.855
How obvious what is?

13:20.879 --> 13:23.645
You trying to set me up.

13:23.669 --> 13:28.315
Like I need a date after you
made me the fifth wheel.

13:28.339 --> 13:29.815
Not everyone is like you,
Jackson.

13:29.839 --> 13:32.565
She thought it was
a bigger party. That's why...

13:32.589 --> 13:33.969
I wasn't trying to set you up.

13:36.209 --> 13:38.275
What is that supposed to mean...
"not everyone's like me"?

13:38.299 --> 13:39.945
Most people
take the time to grieve

13:39.969 --> 13:41.525
after the end of a relationship

13:41.549 --> 13:43.815
before jumping into
the next one.

13:43.839 --> 13:46.395
Yeah.
I-I take time...

13:46.419 --> 13:48.235
Not after April.

13:48.259 --> 13:51.735
You guys had barely ended
when you and I got together.

13:51.759 --> 13:53.815
And we were still together
when you met Vic.

13:53.839 --> 13:56.275
You couldn't even go
on your nature walk

13:56.299 --> 13:59.565
without getting entangled
with some woman named Kate.

13:59.589 --> 14:02.605
Why can't you be alone?

14:02.629 --> 14:04.105
I'm not doing this
with you right now.

14:04.129 --> 14:05.945
Think whatever you want.

14:05.969 --> 14:07.985
I wasn't trying to
set you up, Maggie.

14:08.009 --> 14:09.815
I don't know why you'd even leap
to something like that

14:09.839 --> 14:11.185
if you didn't think
the world revolved around you.

14:11.209 --> 14:12.685
I leapt to it

14:12.709 --> 14:14.065
because he has already
asked me out before.

14:14.089 --> 14:16.395
What?

14:16.419 --> 14:17.445
When? Recently?

14:17.469 --> 14:19.355
No. Months ago.

14:19.379 --> 14:20.605
So, like, when we were together?

14:20.629 --> 14:23.445
Yeah, while you were
on your nature walk-about,

14:23.469 --> 14:26.395
sending me pictures of trees.

14:26.419 --> 14:28.605
Should I have
sent you a picture of him

14:28.629 --> 14:31.169
with that, like,
shrugging "why not?" emoji?

14:34.379 --> 14:36.815
Well, he's here now.

14:36.839 --> 14:39.259
We might as well be hospitable.

14:41.419 --> 14:44.395
I don't think you got to worry
about Jackson and his ex.

14:44.419 --> 14:45.945
Unless you're worried about
them murdering each other.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.355
Mm.

14:47.379 --> 14:49.565
Well, that's good.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.645
You'll be all set up for your
second chance with her.

14:51.669 --> 14:53.445
Yeah, she's real thrilled
to see me.

14:53.469 --> 14:56.145
Um, did you even consider maybe
telling her I was coming?

14:56.169 --> 14:58.145
Oh, yeah,

14:58.169 --> 15:00.815
but then she probably
would have bailed. Mm-hmm.

15:00.839 --> 15:02.185
And then you wouldn't be
having dinner

15:02.209 --> 15:04.445
with your boyfriend's ex.

15:04.469 --> 15:06.605
Time to eat!

15:06.629 --> 15:08.379
Well, it's too late now, so...

15:14.089 --> 15:15.355
Oh, actually,
my mom usually sits here,

15:15.379 --> 15:16.645
so we'll just...

15:16.669 --> 15:19.445
Sit. Sit. It's fine.
Nobody cares.

15:19.469 --> 15:22.185
Nobody cares about anything.

15:22.209 --> 15:25.709
Everybody sit.
Please.

15:29.799 --> 15:31.669
Smells great in there.
What'd you make?

15:32.759 --> 15:34.355
Shrimp scampi.

15:34.379 --> 15:36.185
Is there a problem?
Are you allergic?

15:36.209 --> 15:37.275
Vic?
No.

15:37.299 --> 15:39.299
She'll put anything
in her mouth.

15:43.589 --> 15:45.145
Anything...
Anything that's food.

15:45.169 --> 15:47.105
Only food.

15:47.129 --> 15:49.605
Hm. How lovely.

15:49.629 --> 15:52.735
A little salad, dear, please?
Thank you.

15:52.759 --> 15:54.105
Let me tell you about that time

15:54.129 --> 15:55.669
she stopped a snake
from eating a baby.

15:59.050 --> 16:01.146
So, Dr. Webber,
you're Maggie's father.

16:01.170 --> 16:02.396
Call me Richard, please.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.566
And yes, I am.

16:04.590 --> 16:07.026
And Dr. Fox...
or do you prefer Catherine?

16:07.050 --> 16:09.276
Dr. Fox is fine.

16:09.300 --> 16:11.686
Okay.
You're Jackson's mother?

16:11.710 --> 16:13.420
Uh, pass the bread, please.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.066
Yes.
I'm Jackson's mother.

16:17.090 --> 16:18.816
So, when you two started dating,

16:18.840 --> 16:20.356
was that before
they got married?

16:20.380 --> 16:22.606
Not really, no.

16:22.630 --> 16:23.936
We never thought of
ourselves as family.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.106
Yes, you did.

16:25.130 --> 16:26.476
That's why I had such a reaction

16:26.500 --> 16:28.436
when the two of you started
rolling around together.

16:28.460 --> 16:30.026
No, Mom.

16:30.050 --> 16:32.186
We were happy for them.

16:32.210 --> 16:33.187
Hm.
Mm.

16:33.211 --> 16:34.896
Thank you.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.316
Jackson and I
didn't grow up together.

16:37.340 --> 16:40.106
We had very different
upbringings.

16:40.130 --> 16:41.606
How so?

16:41.630 --> 16:42.976
I took a bus to school,
and he had a private chauffeur.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.146
Dean's a rich boy, too.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.856
Oh, are you?

16:45.880 --> 16:47.356
Maggie doesn't like guys
that have money.

16:47.380 --> 16:50.106
No, I like the ones
who are down to earth.

16:50.130 --> 16:51.736
So, Maggie,
you grew up in Boston?

16:51.760 --> 16:52.976
Mm-hmm.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.356
I have a cousin in Brighton.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.026
Oh, yeah?
What street?

16:56.050 --> 16:58.646
I don't remember.
There were old brick houses.

16:58.670 --> 16:59.936
Does that help?
Yeah.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.280
Yeah, that really
narrows it down.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.776
Oh, you know what?

17:05.800 --> 17:07.816
You remember
the Korean restaurant we loved,

17:07.839 --> 17:09.396
uh, near my old place on Graham?

17:09.420 --> 17:10.526
Mm-hmm.
It burned down.

17:10.550 --> 17:11.776
Vic saved the owner,

17:11.800 --> 17:13.146
pulled him right out
of the kitchen.

17:13.170 --> 17:14.646
He was the sweetest old man.

17:14.670 --> 17:15.646
He got really shaken up.

17:15.671 --> 17:16.935
Apparently, the landlord

17:16.960 --> 17:19.356
hadn't changed the electrical
wiring in like a decade.

17:19.380 --> 17:21.736
Sadly, we see it all the time
in old restaurants.

17:21.760 --> 17:24.420
That's a terrible story.

17:27.670 --> 17:30.436
Richard, you're a surgeon,
too, right? A general?

17:30.460 --> 17:31.736
Yes, I am.
At Pac-North.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.026
When I was in training,

17:33.050 --> 17:34.500
we called that place
"The Morgue."

17:35.880 --> 17:37.396
Did they know back then

17:37.420 --> 17:39.976
that there was a burial ground
in the backyard?

17:40.000 --> 17:42.106
They broke ground on a new wing

17:42.130 --> 17:44.476
and found out
the place used to be an asylum.

17:44.500 --> 17:47.670
Unclaimed bodies just tossed
in a hole like feces. Oof!

17:49.710 --> 17:52.396
We didn't exactly publicize
that incident, Catherine.

17:52.420 --> 17:53.566
Hmm.

17:53.590 --> 17:55.646
The bodies were removed
respectfully.

17:55.670 --> 17:57.276
T-That's... good.

17:57.300 --> 17:59.066
I've heard things have
really turned around. Yeah.

17:59.090 --> 18:00.606
Now the nickname's
just Pac-North,

18:00.630 --> 18:01.936
so you know.

18:01.960 --> 18:03.356
Not really a nickname.

18:03.380 --> 18:04.606
Actually, it is a nickname.

18:04.630 --> 18:06.066
It's short for
Pacific Northwest.

18:06.090 --> 18:07.316
You say "actually" a lot.

18:07.340 --> 18:09.606
I just meant that first
responders all over the city

18:09.630 --> 18:10.686
are talking about
the improvements

18:10.710 --> 18:12.316
over the past few months.

18:12.340 --> 18:13.896
People really want to bring
their patients there now.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.606
Oh, how about that? That's really,
really great.

18:15.630 --> 18:18.276
You mean they prefer to
go there over Grey-Sloan?

18:18.300 --> 18:20.026
Mom. Catherine, you've only seen

18:20.050 --> 18:21.396
the waiting room at Pac-North.

18:21.420 --> 18:22.816
I've seen more.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.686
The outside of your office.

18:24.710 --> 18:27.316
Hmm.
When?

18:27.340 --> 18:30.630
You were busy having coffee
with a friend.

18:32.840 --> 18:34.776
Just to clarify,
I like both hospitals.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.276
How about we just change
the subject entirely?

18:36.300 --> 18:37.277
Yeah!
I'm for that.

18:37.301 --> 18:38.710
Please.
Yay.

18:42.210 --> 18:44.606
It is your anniversary, right?

18:44.630 --> 18:47.000
How did you two meet?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.686
Maybe we can just... Nope.

18:59.710 --> 19:02.026
I'm saying just a little
something to eat.

19:02.050 --> 19:04.260
You're sounding like my mom now.

19:32.380 --> 19:35.050
They said he was sick.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.816
Didn't say...

19:39.840 --> 19:42.816
I'm so sorry.
I'm... I'm Levi.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.976
I know exactly who you are.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Doctor.

19:51.170 --> 19:52.936
They used to
call you "Glasses."

19:52.960 --> 19:54.396
Uh...

19:54.420 --> 19:59.186
But now you've made a-a real
name for yourself, right?

19:59.210 --> 20:00.526
Saul talked about me?

20:00.550 --> 20:02.316
All the time.

20:02.340 --> 20:05.630
And you... you must be
Levi's boyfriend.

20:06.920 --> 20:07.897
Right?

20:07.921 --> 20:09.856
You knew?

20:09.880 --> 20:12.396
Saul... Saul knew?

20:12.420 --> 20:13.686
Of course he knew.

20:13.710 --> 20:15.776
Excellent gaydar.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.316
I'm sorry, what?

20:17.340 --> 20:19.880
It takes one to know one, son.

20:21.170 --> 20:23.316
I'm Daniel Schwartz.

20:23.340 --> 20:24.436
Nico.

20:24.460 --> 20:26.436
Uh, but Gertie was his wife.

20:26.460 --> 20:29.396
Gertie and Saul took each other
for who they were.

20:29.420 --> 20:34.816
They lived their lives,
never asked any questions,

20:34.840 --> 20:36.670
and they never told a soul.

20:39.420 --> 20:41.186
So you're...

20:41.210 --> 20:43.760
Saul was the love of my life.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.550
And I was his.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.170
And I guess we still are.

21:02.150 --> 21:04.586
Wait.
So, she proposed to you?

21:04.610 --> 21:06.256
Yeah, I mean, mom's used to
always getting what she wants,

21:06.280 --> 21:08.126
and if she's got to ask,
she'll ask.

21:08.819 --> 21:10.135
I wouldn't say
"always."

21:10.159 --> 21:12.175
That was a long time ago.

21:12.199 --> 21:13.675
And it wasn't just any proposal.

21:13.699 --> 21:15.965
It was quite the spectacle.

21:15.989 --> 21:17.385
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

21:17.409 --> 21:18.505
Tell them, Catherine.

21:18.529 --> 21:19.885
You're doing so well.

21:19.909 --> 21:21.095
Okay.

21:21.119 --> 21:25.005
Um, so, Catherine
hired a string quartet,

21:25.029 --> 21:27.295
and she's got them hiding
in the lobby of the hospital,

21:27.319 --> 21:30.555
which is filled with...
with roses and candles.

21:30.579 --> 21:33.505
Mom hates romantic gestures.
This is not her style at all.

21:33.529 --> 21:36.465
Richard had been trying to
propose romantically for months.

21:36.489 --> 21:39.055
And she wouldn't let him.
She just called it "nonsense."

21:39.079 --> 21:40.965
So, Richard's at work,

21:40.989 --> 21:43.255
and Catherine
starts shouting at him.

21:43.279 --> 21:45.055
And she's yelling about

21:45.079 --> 21:47.215
how Richard is worth
every heartbreak,

21:47.239 --> 21:49.675
and she doesn't care
if she looks like a fool

21:49.699 --> 21:52.345
yelling her feelings
out in front of everyone.

21:52.369 --> 21:55.175
And then
she walks down the stairs

21:55.199 --> 21:57.555
and she looks in his eyes
and takes his hands,

21:57.579 --> 22:00.635
and she says...

22:00.659 --> 22:03.819
"And I would very much like it
if you would be my husband."

22:06.739 --> 22:08.409
Tell 'em what you said, Richard.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.555
Oh, you two really like to
build that suspense.

22:15.579 --> 22:17.175
Come on, come on!

22:17.199 --> 22:19.505
I said...

22:19.529 --> 22:21.029
"Well,
it's about damn time."

22:22.779 --> 22:24.635
That's Richard Webber.
Alright, you know what?

22:24.659 --> 22:26.215
- It's time for a toast.
- Aww.

22:26.239 --> 22:27.505
To these two amazing people.

22:27.529 --> 22:30.005
To Catherine and Richard.

22:30.029 --> 22:32.505
I am so happy
that my mom found you.

22:32.529 --> 22:34.255
Richard, you've been more
a father to me

22:34.279 --> 22:35.635
than my birth father ever was.

22:35.659 --> 22:38.055
I've never seen anyone
make my mom happier.

22:38.079 --> 22:39.555
Y'all have had
your ups and downs,

22:39.579 --> 22:41.095
but you always push through.

22:41.119 --> 22:44.965
You two are the gold standard.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.845
I love you.
Happy anniversary.

22:46.869 --> 22:47.925
To you.
Happy anniversary.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.055
Happy anniversary.

22:49.079 --> 22:51.239
So sweet. Thank you.

22:53.279 --> 22:56.505
So, Saul says that there's this
huge emergency at the bank.

22:56.529 --> 22:58.795
They're willing to pay
three times per roll

22:58.819 --> 23:01.505
for anyone who can bring in
the most pennies in an hour.

23:01.529 --> 23:03.965
So, I scramble
around all the couch cushions,

23:03.989 --> 23:06.255
he's helping me
pack 'em in like sardines.

23:06.279 --> 23:10.295
10 minutes later,
he comes back with a $50 bill.

23:10.319 --> 23:12.215
And I feel like
I saved the freakin' world.

23:12.239 --> 23:14.425
From...
a penny shortage?

23:14.449 --> 23:15.845
I was 6.

23:15.869 --> 23:18.425
But you realize there's
no such thing, right?

23:18.449 --> 23:21.239
Wait, really?

23:26.319 --> 23:29.675
Oh, oh, we shouldn't be
laughing like this.

23:29.699 --> 23:31.215
It's okay, son.

23:31.239 --> 23:33.345
The only people Saul
would want to make miserable

23:33.369 --> 23:35.659
are your mom
and a few ex-boyfriends.

23:37.409 --> 23:39.595
Oh, he really hated my mom.

23:39.619 --> 23:40.925
He never trusted her.

23:40.949 --> 23:42.925
She learned from her parents

23:42.949 --> 23:45.635
about who is supposed to
lie with whom.

23:45.659 --> 23:46.885
And she bought into it.

23:46.909 --> 23:48.595
My family never cared.

23:48.619 --> 23:50.965
Thought I was exotic,

23:50.989 --> 23:54.739
told every neighbor
or postman who'd listen.

23:58.909 --> 24:01.055
The Chevra Kaddisha
should be here by now.

24:01.079 --> 24:03.095
I-I-I don't like
leaving him like this.

24:03.119 --> 24:04.675
We don't have to
if you don't want to.

24:04.699 --> 24:06.055
I've been trained.

24:06.079 --> 24:09.135
I can teach you
how to prepare his body.

24:09.159 --> 24:11.819
I wouldn't want you
to have to...

24:14.489 --> 24:16.279
It would be my honor.

24:30.819 --> 24:34.595
I hadn't thought about
that story in a long time.

24:34.619 --> 24:36.175
I know. Me either.

24:36.199 --> 24:40.215
Richard, maybe we've been too
rash with this separation.

24:40.239 --> 24:42.555
Jackson is right.

24:42.579 --> 24:44.715
We've been through bad times,

24:44.739 --> 24:48.095
month-long arguments,

24:48.119 --> 24:52.215
but we do always find a way.

24:52.239 --> 24:56.255
I know we're angry
with each other

24:56.279 --> 24:59.555
and we're hard-headed,

24:59.579 --> 25:03.555
but I think
we shouldn't give up.

25:03.579 --> 25:05.715
The wine's making you misty.

25:05.739 --> 25:09.255
It's not the wine, Richard.

25:09.279 --> 25:11.909
I love you.

25:16.489 --> 25:19.215
Then apologize.

25:19.239 --> 25:24.425
I know that doesn't
come easy for you,

25:24.449 --> 25:26.965
but if you love me, Catherine,

25:26.989 --> 25:30.255
and you want this to work...

25:30.279 --> 25:33.425
say that you're sorry
that you didn't stand by me.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.795
That you showed no loyalty.

25:35.819 --> 25:39.885
That I had to reinvent my life.

25:39.909 --> 25:44.505
That I had to leave behind
the hospital that I built,

25:44.529 --> 25:46.869
people I loved.

25:48.529 --> 25:52.385
You've said a lot of things,

25:52.409 --> 25:55.555
but "sorry" wasn't one of them.

25:55.579 --> 25:58.385
Richard...

25:58.409 --> 26:01.175
I am sorry, but...

26:01.199 --> 26:06.465
Apologies don't have
the word "but" after them.

26:06.489 --> 26:11.255
"I'm sorry but"...

26:11.279 --> 26:14.795
is too little, Catherine.

26:14.819 --> 26:16.199
It's too late.

27:12.734 --> 27:13.920
Why Gertie?

27:13.944 --> 27:15.500
Why pretend?

27:15.524 --> 27:18.000
Why not just build a home
and a life

27:18.024 --> 27:19.734
with the man you love?

27:23.194 --> 27:25.540
I'm sorry.
I did not mean to pry.

27:25.564 --> 27:30.080
Your generation takes
for granted what is possible.

27:30.104 --> 27:31.380
I'm sorry, I...

27:31.404 --> 27:33.774
No, no, no, no.
It's... It's okay.

27:36.484 --> 27:43.540
In fact, it gives me hope
that it has come so far

27:43.564 --> 27:46.944
that you could take that
for granted, even for a second.

27:51.354 --> 27:53.830
Saul loved men.

27:53.854 --> 27:56.040
He loved me.

27:56.064 --> 27:58.750
For decades.

27:58.774 --> 28:02.620
But there was something
inside of him...

28:02.644 --> 28:04.040
that wouldn't let him.

28:04.064 --> 28:06.500
I would have married him,

28:06.524 --> 28:11.170
I would've... I would've
built a home with him.

28:11.194 --> 28:12.920
But I didn't know
how to live a life

28:12.944 --> 28:18.420
with someone who hated himself
for loving me.

28:18.444 --> 28:20.880
He was ashamed of himself.

28:20.904 --> 28:23.194
Every day.

28:26.104 --> 28:28.420
And... And Gertie?
She didn't know?

28:28.444 --> 28:29.710
Of course she knew.

28:29.734 --> 28:33.460
She pretended they were married

28:33.484 --> 28:37.210
because they cared
for each other.

28:37.234 --> 28:40.830
And because he... he asked her.

28:40.854 --> 28:44.234
I will never take it
for granted again.

28:45.814 --> 28:50.000
You know,
I don't think it's an accident,

28:50.024 --> 28:52.670
you being here until the end.

28:52.694 --> 28:56.880
He saw you, who you are,
all of you.

28:56.904 --> 29:00.460
I think there's a part of him
that wanted you to come here

29:00.484 --> 29:06.080
so that you would know
it's okay...

29:06.104 --> 29:08.960
that you'd have the freedom

29:08.984 --> 29:11.644
that he never gave himself.

30:44.484 --> 30:47.460
This was supposed to be

And your plus one

30:55.644 --> 30:58.170
I thought you all
cleared everything up.

30:58.194 --> 31:00.790
Let's talk about it later.

31:00.814 --> 31:02.500
This is not the time.

31:02.524 --> 31:03.694
Thank you.

31:05.604 --> 31:08.210
Wait, wait, wait.
You live on a boat?

31:08.234 --> 31:09.330
Yeah.

31:09.354 --> 31:12.670
What is it with rich guys
and boats?

31:12.694 --> 31:15.000
You have a boat?

31:15.024 --> 31:16.330
Do you tell her anything?

31:16.354 --> 31:18.080
It was an impulse buy.

31:18.104 --> 31:19.710
I do have a boat,
guilty as charged.

31:19.734 --> 31:21.000
"Impulse buy."

31:21.024 --> 31:23.460
Shoes are an impulse buy,
maybe a car.

31:23.484 --> 31:25.710
Jackson bought a yacht.

31:25.734 --> 31:27.460
What did you spend?
Two million? Three million?

31:27.484 --> 31:28.540
Where do you dock yours?

31:28.564 --> 31:29.790
Getting kind of old now, Maggie.

31:29.814 --> 31:31.540
I think you're kind of
embarrassing yourself.

31:31.564 --> 31:33.290
I'm pretty sure I'm not.

31:33.314 --> 31:35.120
Does he do this with you?

31:35.144 --> 31:37.460
Does he try to
change you all the time?

31:37.484 --> 31:40.354
No. Oddly enough,
I like her just the way she is.

31:42.024 --> 31:44.540
Oh, yeah.

31:44.564 --> 31:46.540
Hey.

31:46.564 --> 31:50.290
Uh, uh... Um, um...
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry, um...

31:50.314 --> 31:51.750
What... What...
What were you saying?

31:51.774 --> 31:53.710
He and Maggie are arguing.

31:53.734 --> 31:55.380
They can't stand each other.

31:55.404 --> 31:57.380
They've been trying to
be civil for our sake,

31:57.404 --> 31:58.710
which is a total joke.

31:58.734 --> 32:01.250
But you haven't been around
enough to notice, have you?

32:01.274 --> 32:02.500
Well, that would be hard

32:02.524 --> 32:04.500
since I no longer work
at the same hospital.

32:04.524 --> 32:06.920
'Cause you took a job
at a glorified clinic

32:06.944 --> 32:08.920
just to spite your own wife.

32:08.944 --> 32:10.380
I didn't have a choice

32:10.404 --> 32:12.484
after I was fired
from the one she owns.

32:13.694 --> 32:15.774
Don't you even look at that
phone, Richard Webber.

32:19.024 --> 32:20.790
Why didn't you just invite her

32:20.814 --> 32:23.250
since you can't go
20 minutes without texting?

32:23.274 --> 32:25.040
Invite who?
His girlfriend.

32:25.064 --> 32:27.290
Some Pac-North heifer.
Oh.

32:27.314 --> 32:29.380
I don't have
a girlfriend, Catherine.

32:29.404 --> 32:31.000
Something I've been
trying to drill

32:31.024 --> 32:32.460
in your thick skull for months!

32:32.484 --> 32:34.380
 - Well, I don't believe you.
- See for yourself.

32:34.404 --> 32:36.144
Can we not do this now?

32:40.604 --> 32:42.170
You wouldn't dare.

32:42.194 --> 32:43.330
I certainly would.

32:43.354 --> 32:44.670
Dare what?

32:44.694 --> 32:46.330
I've been talking to Karev

32:46.354 --> 32:49.420
about making you an offer
to run our cardio department.

32:49.444 --> 32:50.381
He approved the offer.

32:50.405 --> 32:51.960
It's ridiculous.

32:51.984 --> 32:53.960
She wouldn't step out of her
comfort zone for that.

32:53.984 --> 32:56.330
You don't know what I would do.

32:56.354 --> 32:58.080
Is this what you wanted to
tell us earlier?

32:58.104 --> 33:00.960
No! We wanted to tell you
that we're separating.

33:00.984 --> 33:04.710
It was supposed to be quiet
and loving, not a potluck.

33:04.734 --> 33:05.711
You're separating?

33:05.735 --> 33:07.620
How long has this been going on?

33:07.644 --> 33:09.064
Who cares?

33:10.854 --> 33:12.604
It's over now.

33:16.194 --> 33:18.500
Richard, I had no idea.

33:18.524 --> 33:21.920
Um...

33:21.944 --> 33:26.524
I'm... sorry you had to
hear it this way.

33:27.604 --> 33:31.250
I really am.

33:31.274 --> 33:32.484
Excuse me.

33:38.064 --> 33:40.024
- Uh, excuse me.
- Okay, yeah.

33:52.814 --> 33:54.920
Yep.

33:54.944 --> 33:56.604
You definitely owe me.

34:11.562 --> 34:13.328
Mom.

34:13.351 --> 34:14.918
I thought y'all had
worked things out.

34:14.942 --> 34:16.328
I'm sorry.

34:16.351 --> 34:18.288
No, it's fine.

34:18.312 --> 34:19.918
It's fine, I'll...

34:19.942 --> 34:22.588
I'll be fine, I just...

34:22.612 --> 34:24.538
I just hate you losing Richard.

34:24.562 --> 34:25.788
He's like a father to you.

34:25.812 --> 34:27.458
Don't be silly.
I'm not losing anything.

34:27.482 --> 34:28.538
Don't worry about me.

34:28.562 --> 34:30.458
I feel like such a failure.

34:30.482 --> 34:31.918
I tried, Jackson.
I tried.

34:31.942 --> 34:33.918
Hey, you are not a failure
at anything.

34:33.942 --> 34:35.538
Sometimes relationships
just don't work out.

34:35.562 --> 34:37.918
You know that.
That's all.

34:37.942 --> 34:39.458
Come on.

34:39.482 --> 34:41.538
You are such a good man.

34:41.562 --> 34:43.002
Oh, who do we have
to thank for that?

34:48.112 --> 34:51.708
I was just dropping these off.

34:51.732 --> 34:53.538
Oh, wait, Vic.

34:53.562 --> 34:57.458
You haven't had any of my
blackberry cobbler yet.

34:57.482 --> 34:59.128
She is kinda famous for it.

34:59.152 --> 35:00.788
Yeah, yeah.
I'd really like that.

35:00.812 --> 35:02.088
Good.

35:02.112 --> 35:03.708
'Cause if you had said no...
Thank you.

35:03.732 --> 35:05.932
...I was gonna have to eat this
whole damn thing myself.

35:06.852 --> 35:08.498
Dig in.
Ooh.

35:08.522 --> 35:10.288
Is this...?
Yeah. Just get in there.

35:10.312 --> 35:11.668
Just go for it? Okay.
Mm!

35:11.692 --> 35:13.022
Mom, no.

35:14.442 --> 35:16.828
No, guilty pleasure.
I need it.

35:16.852 --> 35:18.022
I deserve it.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.038
Jackson mentioned
that he thought

35:22.062 --> 35:25.208
you two might be... off,

35:25.232 --> 35:28.748
but I... I had no idea.

35:28.772 --> 35:32.998
Catherine and I tend to
keep our problems to ourselves.

35:33.022 --> 35:36.628
That was quite a show, huh?

35:36.652 --> 35:38.458
Catherine thought
that a nice meal

35:38.482 --> 35:40.788
would make it easier to
break the news.

35:40.812 --> 35:42.708
You think it's really over?

35:42.732 --> 35:44.708
I do, unfortunately.

35:44.732 --> 35:46.378
I'm sorry.

35:46.402 --> 35:47.788
Ah.

35:47.812 --> 35:50.902
I thought we were celebrating.
I brought chocolates.

35:52.692 --> 35:54.212
Well, at least
you didn't bring a date.

35:57.522 --> 36:01.168
We thought we needed to
get along for your sakes.

36:01.192 --> 36:02.878
At least we can stop doing that.

36:02.902 --> 36:05.852
Yeah. I guess we can
all stop pretending.

36:07.562 --> 36:08.878
Hey, what was that offer?

36:08.902 --> 36:10.878
From, uh, Pac-North.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.788
I'm curious.

36:12.812 --> 36:14.878
Maggie,
you don't have to humor me.

36:14.902 --> 36:16.878
I'm a free agent.

36:16.902 --> 36:18.168
If the price is right...

36:18.192 --> 36:19.942
Look who knows how to bargain.

36:27.402 --> 36:29.498
Um...

36:29.522 --> 36:31.208
Alex thinks I'm worth this much?

36:31.232 --> 36:33.192
Not just Alex, Maggie.

36:36.272 --> 36:38.442
Then I guess I have a new job.

36:42.652 --> 36:45.498
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

36:45.522 --> 36:50.168
Eh, you know,
I'll go to a meeting.

36:50.192 --> 36:51.852
Yeah, I'll be fine.

36:53.942 --> 36:55.458
I'll see you Monday.

36:55.482 --> 36:56.942
I'll see you Monday.

37:07.232 --> 37:09.588
Leaving so soon?

37:09.612 --> 37:12.878
This was not a place
I should have been.

37:12.902 --> 37:14.128
Oh.
Yeah.

37:14.152 --> 37:15.918
Thank you.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.208

37:17.232 --> 37:18.708

Yeah.

37:26.732 --> 37:28.128

37:28.152 --> 37:32.498

37:32.522 --> 37:34.878
It's not your fault.

37:34.902 --> 37:36.828
Uh, I don't think any of us
should have been here tonight.

37:36.852 --> 37:38.402
Yeah.

37:39.902 --> 37:42.668
Uh, Vic, wait.
I, um...

37:42.692 --> 37:45.788
I clearly still have some
differences with Jackson,

37:45.812 --> 37:47.788
but I think I've been
taking them out on you,

37:47.812 --> 37:50.498

I set you up on a date without telling you,

37:54.112 --> 37:55.168
so I think we're even.
