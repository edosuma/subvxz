WEBVTT

00:00.410 --> 00:01.870
A mother lost her son!

00:01.870 --> 00:03.330
Have you no heart,
Judge Wilson!

00:04.330 --> 00:05.540
I want both
our families to meet.

00:05.540 --> 00:07.460
Pick you guys
up here around 6:00?

00:07.460 --> 00:08.920
(cell phone buzzing)

00:09.250 --> 00:10.960
Melina:
We're planning
a disruption.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.970
We need someone
to livestream the action.

00:12.970 --> 00:15.550
Melina:
<i>You can't stop filming</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

00:15.550 --> 00:16.970
Patrisse:
<i>We also need it</i>
<i>for our safety.</i>

00:16.970 --> 00:19.140
Lindsay got me a spot.
I'm going to do my tight‐five.

00:19.140 --> 00:22.100
<i>Actually, I don't</i>
<i>want you to come.</i>

00:22.350 --> 00:23.600
(exhales forcefully)

00:23.600 --> 00:25.350
Have you ever
dated anyone

00:25.350 --> 00:27.360
who's over, say,
a size 2?

00:27.360 --> 00:30.860
If you just lost 30 pounds,
you could get any man you want.

00:30.860 --> 00:32.030
So you do love Dennis?

00:32.689 --> 00:34.200
I have something
I need to tell you.

00:34.490 --> 00:36.030
Jennifer and I are going
to try and work things out.

00:36.030 --> 00:38.160
We actually just signed
the divorce papers.

00:38.490 --> 00:40.200
Evan:
This is Kendra Zahir.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.000
Kendra is here
to oversee

00:42.000 --> 00:43.370
daily operations.

00:43.370 --> 00:46.170
Kendra:
We need you to step down
as team leader of your app.

00:46.170 --> 00:48.170
I never should have
gotten involved with you.

00:48.170 --> 00:50.090
And to see
your lying face every day.

00:50.090 --> 00:52.170
Mariana:
<i>No wonder he's upset.</i>
<i>I'm on his side.</i>

00:52.170 --> 00:53.420
Callie:
<i>Mariana, you're my sister!</i>

00:53.420 --> 00:55.050
You're supposed
to have my back!

00:55.050 --> 00:56.970
<i>I decided to move in</i>
<i>with Jamie.</i>

00:57.840 --> 01:00.100
<i>I'll get the rest</i>
<i>of my stuff this weekend.</i>

01:02.600 --> 01:06.400

Melina: In Black Lives matter,
we fight for our people

02:17.380 --> 02:19.640
whose lives are stolen
by police.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.760
Woman: Yes, we do!

02:20.760 --> 02:23.890
Jamal Thompson was
only 19 years old

02:23.890 --> 02:24.770
when he was killed,

02:25.180 --> 02:26.930
Patrisse: Judge Wilson,
we are here today to...

02:26.930 --> 02:29.390
So Judge Wilson
didn't press charges

02:29.390 --> 02:31.310
but he filed
a restraining order
against me.

02:31.900 --> 02:35.030
Look, you're not likely
to cross paths.

02:35.440 --> 02:38.450
If you do, you need
to leave wherever you are.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.490
Immediately.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.240
Patrisse:
...right side of history.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.780
Melina:
Jamal Thompson
was only 19.

02:43.780 --> 02:45.580
He was his mother's
only child.

02:45.580 --> 02:47.700
And she lost
any hope at justice

02:47.700 --> 02:49.330
because of
Judge Curtis Wilson.

02:49.330 --> 02:50.830
Patrisse:
Judge Wilson consistently

02:50.830 --> 02:52.750
favors police over victims.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.960
And we are demanding
Judge Wilson

02:54.960 --> 02:57.090
is not appointed
to Appellate Courts.

02:57.090 --> 02:58.760
All right, you've made
your point, it's time
to head out.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.180
They have the right
to protest.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.180
Patrisse:
Do not allow this judge

03:02.180 --> 03:05.100
to build his career
off of our death.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.930
By stacking the courts
with Judges like Wilson,

03:07.930 --> 03:10.390
not only is justice
for Jamal threatened

03:10.390 --> 03:12.900
along with the thousands
of others killed by...

03:12.900 --> 03:15.980
But it challenges settled law
like Roe v. Wade.

03:15.980 --> 03:20.070
It's about the civil rights
of marginalized people

03:20.070 --> 03:21.320
which are now in jeopardy.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.870
I am going
to ask you once

03:23.870 --> 03:25.160
to vacate the premises.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.040
These women
are simply exercising

03:27.040 --> 03:29.160
their legal right
to free speech!

03:30.500 --> 03:34.170
You have five minutes
before we physically
remove you for trespassing.

03:34.170 --> 03:34.960
Shame on you.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.460
Man:
Just take them out now!

03:37.090 --> 03:38.340
Come on. You don't want
to get arrested.

03:38.340 --> 03:40.170
Judge Wilson is a good man.

03:40.170 --> 03:41.970
Jamal's life mattered!

03:42.380 --> 03:44.140
All protesters:
Jamal's life mattered!

03:44.140 --> 03:52.730
Jamal's life mattered!

03:52.730 --> 03:53.600
‐Let's go
‐(chanting continues)

03:55.400 --> 03:57.070
Justine:
You gave them
five minutes!

03:57.070 --> 03:58.320
This arrest is unjust.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.820
They did not give you
time to disperse!

04:00.190 --> 04:01.280
You should not be
arresting them!

04:01.990 --> 04:10.950
Jamal's life mattered!

04:12.080 --> 04:14.080
I got kicked off my app.
My app, my baby.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.459
And this "fixer"
is gunning for me.

04:16.459 --> 04:18.170
I could lose my job,
and my boss

04:18.170 --> 04:19.500
isn't even returning
any of my texts

04:19.500 --> 04:21.880
because, well,
I'm sort of responsible
for him getting sued.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.260
But what does Callie do?

04:23.260 --> 04:25.260
Moves out
and she leaves me a note.

04:25.260 --> 04:26.260
A note.

04:26.260 --> 04:27.390
At least she gave you
written notice.

04:27.390 --> 04:28.680
Kelly: Personally...

04:28.680 --> 04:30.680
‐I never thought
she fit in here.
‐Who?

04:30.680 --> 04:32.020
Mariana:
Callie moved in with Jamie.

04:33.560 --> 04:34.980
Did you hear
I got kicked off my app?

04:34.980 --> 04:36.150
No. Why?

04:36.150 --> 04:38.150
Well, I'm being singled out

04:38.150 --> 04:40.530
for exposing
the gender pay gap.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.190
Does that mean that
Claire's in charge now?

04:42.190 --> 04:44.150
No. I'm still in charge.

04:44.740 --> 04:46.240
Well, not officially.

04:47.070 --> 04:48.160
Nice hoodie by the way.

04:48.700 --> 04:49.490
Thanks.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.830
I'll write a good review
about it if you pay me.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.250
He didn't pay for it.
Elijah did.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.330
‐So, was that‐‐
was that all he paid for?
‐Gael: Yup.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.380
You're an asshole.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.090
Uh, I'm a truth teller.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.050
‐Every group needs one.
‐Okay, I'm sorry.

05:01.050 --> 05:02.710
Does no one care
that my sister abandoned me

05:02.710 --> 05:03.590
at the worst possible moment?

05:03.590 --> 05:05.720
‐Not really.
‐Of course we do.

05:06.970 --> 05:10.010
Actually, I appreciate people
who tell the truth.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.470
‐Hey, has anyone seen Malika?
‐Davia/Mariana: Hey.

05:12.470 --> 05:13.810
‐Mm, check her loft.
‐Haven't seen her.

05:13.810 --> 05:14.850
Kelly:
Oh, you know what?

05:15.140 --> 05:17.150
I think you should check
your Insta tags,

05:17.150 --> 05:19.650
'cause I didn't know
Jeff had a wife.

05:20.650 --> 05:22.480
Mariana: Her tags?
Are you stalking her?

05:23.150 --> 05:24.190
Maybe.

05:26.610 --> 05:28.370
(chuckles)

05:28.370 --> 05:30.030
"How? Did she sit on it?"

05:32.660 --> 05:33.790
(coughs)

05:33.790 --> 05:34.870
Sorry. Not funny.

05:42.550 --> 05:43.960
‐Hey.
‐Hey.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.260
How you doing?
Hey.

05:45.260 --> 05:47.050
‐Hey.
‐Isaac: What's up, man?

05:47.050 --> 05:48.550
‐Ready to meet the fam?
‐Dom: Yo.

05:49.010 --> 05:52.010
Malika's not here.
And she's not
answering her phone, so...

05:54.020 --> 05:57.060
(thumping heartbeats)

06:01.940 --> 06:03.320
As soon as Lindsay
found out she was happy

06:03.320 --> 06:05.240
with someone else,
they wanted her back.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.780
(patrons chatter, laugh)

06:07.780 --> 06:09.530
Joey had an affair
with my girlfriend.

06:09.530 --> 06:11.070
They broke us up.

06:11.950 --> 06:12.910
Woman: Hello!

06:12.910 --> 06:14.080
I just don't trust them.

06:22.590 --> 06:23.710
Hey, um...

06:25.090 --> 06:27.760
So, I just came out
to my parents.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.300
(cheering)

06:29.300 --> 06:30.510
(clears throat)

06:32.010 --> 06:33.220
Thank you.

06:33.220 --> 06:34.760
They were great, you know,

06:34.760 --> 06:36.390
they gave me
a rainbow‐colored duvet.

06:37.270 --> 06:39.020
You know, as long as
I don't cut my hair

06:39.020 --> 06:41.060
or tell any of
the other family members,

06:41.060 --> 06:42.650
then they're 65 percent
on board.

06:42.650 --> 06:44.070
(laughter)

06:44.070 --> 06:47.190
Which is cool, 'cause I'm only
like 65 percent on board

06:47.190 --> 06:48.990
with the stuff that
they do, you know.

06:48.990 --> 06:51.870
For example, my mom uses
hashtags in her text messages.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.120
‐(laughter)
‐Alice: Yeah.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.120
"See you tomorrow,"
hashtag #familyiseverything,

06:56.120 --> 06:57.750
hashtag #chinaforlife,

06:57.750 --> 07:00.330
hashtag #dontbelate,
hashtag #wearabra.

07:00.330 --> 07:02.210
With... with a bitmoji...

07:02.210 --> 07:04.130
Drinking a margarita
on a unicorn.

07:04.130 --> 07:05.420
(indistinct)

07:05.420 --> 07:07.010
...stuff the Peking duck
and call it a day.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.050
...super impressive
'cause she thought

07:09.050 --> 07:09.970
a fist bump
was a sex position.

07:09.970 --> 07:11.550
(laughter)

07:11.550 --> 07:12.970
I'm Alice Kwan.
Thank you.

07:12.970 --> 07:17.100
(cheering and applause)

07:25.190 --> 07:27.190
‐You came.
‐Yeah.

07:29.780 --> 07:33.030
Look, I don't want
my past with Lindsay

07:33.950 --> 07:36.080
to interfere with
my future with you.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.080
Well said.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.410
You just think
of that right now?

07:38.410 --> 07:40.750
No, I...
I definitely rehearsed it.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.080
These are for you.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.880
‐You killed it up there.
‐Thanks.

07:54.090 --> 07:55.140
Fantastic set.

07:55.680 --> 07:56.890
Thanks to you.

07:57.720 --> 07:58.720
You know Joey.

08:00.060 --> 08:01.980
Hey, good to see you,
Lindsay.

08:01.980 --> 08:03.480
It's nice to see you too.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.020
You're both "thems."

08:10.190 --> 08:11.990
Just something
in common.

08:16.990 --> 08:18.620
(horns honking)

08:23.000 --> 08:25.710
(cell phone beeping)

08:46.940 --> 08:47.770
Can I come in?

08:48.230 --> 08:49.230
What's up?

08:52.190 --> 08:54.200
Okay, you know what?
I don't need you defending me.

08:54.650 --> 08:56.740
I thought you got that
after my mother was here.

08:56.740 --> 08:59.120
But I am
a proud fat bitch.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.910
So, just stay off
my ex's ex's Instagram

09:02.910 --> 09:04.370
and go back
to whatever emaciated

09:04.370 --> 09:05.960
20‐year‐old
you're hiding in there.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.000
Because I know
it isn't Jennifer, okay.

09:09.130 --> 09:11.130
She told me that
you signed the divorce papers.

09:12.090 --> 09:13.300
(smacks lips)

09:16.510 --> 09:17.340
Is that all?

09:19.260 --> 09:21.180
Yeah, Dennis,

09:21.930 --> 09:22.850
that's all.

10:50.230 --> 10:52.150
‐Hey.
‐Hey.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.230
I need you to do
something for me.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.240
So this is the room
where it happens.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.160
What's that all?

11:07.000 --> 11:07.950
I'm remodeling.

11:08.290 --> 11:09.540
Really?

11:09.540 --> 11:10.960
'Cause it looks like you're
giving up on your dreams

11:10.960 --> 11:13.170
because you found out
your boyfriend paid someone

11:13.170 --> 11:14.090
to write what's true...

11:14.840 --> 11:16.130
that you're a great artist.

11:17.670 --> 11:18.920
So, you need my help
with something?

11:21.340 --> 11:24.180
Yeah, I want
to make a video.

11:24.430 --> 11:25.390
Oh.

11:26.970 --> 11:28.600
So after I told Teresa

11:28.600 --> 11:31.600
that I'm helping Marcus
with the class action,

11:31.600 --> 11:33.860
she retaliated
by giving me

11:33.860 --> 11:35.230
a bunch of extra work
to do.

11:35.230 --> 11:38.070
So now, you have even less time
to study for the bar?

11:38.070 --> 11:41.860
Yes, but, now I have
a quiet place to study.

11:49.580 --> 11:51.040
Thank you for letting me
stay here.

11:52.170 --> 11:53.420
It doesn't have
to be temporary.

11:54.420 --> 11:55.460
No.

11:57.130 --> 11:59.010
Moving in together
is a big step.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.340
Mm‐hmm.

12:00.340 --> 12:01.630
I want us to be ready.

12:03.800 --> 12:07.310
Besides, I haven't even
told you I love you yet.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.600
So... is this your way
of telling me?

12:12.190 --> 12:13.810
Or just reminding me?

12:15.060 --> 12:16.400
(cell phone beeps)

12:21.030 --> 12:22.950
Why is Ben
texting me?

12:30.080 --> 12:31.120
Is Malika here?

12:32.040 --> 12:33.210
Uh, in her loft.

12:41.380 --> 12:42.970
(crying)

12:46.800 --> 12:47.850
Hey.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.720
I hope tonight
wasn't too weird.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.810
‐With Joey, I mean.
‐Lindsay: Nah.

12:51.810 --> 12:53.810
Joey and I are cool.
We're both "theys"!

12:56.690 --> 12:59.020
How'd you like to open a show
for me in a couple weeks?

13:00.190 --> 13:01.360
For real?

13:01.360 --> 13:03.990
In the comedy capital
of Sacramento.

13:04.320 --> 13:05.820
‐Sacramento?
‐Mm‐hmm.

13:05.820 --> 13:07.240
Like, an overnight?

13:07.240 --> 13:09.370
Yeah. Our food
and hotel room is paid for.

13:09.870 --> 13:11.620
Hotel... room?

13:11.620 --> 13:12.620
I'll sleep
on the couch.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.960
Just kidding.
You'll sleep on the couch.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.580
So, just to be clear...

13:17.920 --> 13:19.960
Oh, hey, not to worry.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.010
I do not want you
to think that

13:22.010 --> 13:23.840
just because you've
only done stand‐up once

13:23.840 --> 13:25.380
and I barely know you

13:25.380 --> 13:26.930
and I did try to kiss you,

13:26.930 --> 13:30.140
that I'm inviting you
out of town as some sort

13:30.140 --> 13:31.930
of elaborate ruse
to seduce you

13:31.930 --> 13:33.600
and break up your relationship
with the person

13:33.600 --> 13:34.770
who broke up mine.

13:36.350 --> 13:38.100
I don't want you
to think that.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.150
O‐kay.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.570
I won't?

13:43.610 --> 13:45.150
And I guess I could use

13:45.150 --> 13:47.700
some free shower caps
and mini‐soaps.

13:49.740 --> 13:52.290
‐I just need to check
my schedule.
‐Sure.

13:52.910 --> 13:54.290
Get back
to me tomorrow.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.910
Thanks, again.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.630
It's not a violation
of the restraining order

14:01.630 --> 14:03.000
if you didn't know he was there.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.300
It is if she didn't leave.

14:06.010 --> 14:07.760
I couldn't bail
on everyone.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.140
How much trouble
am I in?

14:13.600 --> 14:15.430
It's a misdemeanor
level offense.

14:16.140 --> 14:19.060
But... you could be sentenced
up to a year in jail.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.190
Mariana:
What are you doing here?

14:25.860 --> 14:26.990
I thought you didn't
live here anymore?

14:28.030 --> 14:29.200
(door opens)

14:29.740 --> 14:31.030
(door slams shut)

14:36.160 --> 14:37.330
Your Honor.

14:38.370 --> 14:39.540
Callie.

14:39.540 --> 14:40.460
How are you?

14:41.790 --> 14:43.500
Your friend violated
a restraining order.

14:43.500 --> 14:44.800
She didn't know
you were gonna be there,

14:44.800 --> 14:46.590
or that the disruption
was targeting you.

14:46.590 --> 14:48.170
I find that hard to believe.

14:48.170 --> 14:49.380
Even if she didn't know,

14:49.380 --> 14:50.970
she didn't leave
when she found out.

14:50.970 --> 14:51.970
She was under pressure.

14:51.970 --> 14:53.550
To participate
in an attack

14:53.550 --> 14:54.930
on me and my reputation.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.810
And you expect me to give her
a second pass for that?

14:58.390 --> 15:00.060
I will not continue
to be harassed.

15:00.060 --> 15:02.150
Not by you
and certainly not by her!

15:19.750 --> 15:20.960

Thank you.

16:12.340 --> 16:13.510
For decades,

16:13.510 --> 16:15.220
the tech industry
has denied women

16:15.220 --> 16:16.930
their seat at the table

16:16.930 --> 16:18.510
with glaring wage gaps,

16:18.510 --> 16:19.720
sexual harassment,

16:19.970 --> 16:21.390
limited opportunities.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.020
I'm here to fix that,

16:23.690 --> 16:25.150
at least at Speckulate.

16:25.770 --> 16:27.900
So over the next few days,
I'm going to be speaking

16:27.900 --> 16:30.030
to each of you individually
to hear your concerns

16:30.030 --> 16:32.070
and also to investigate
the leak

16:32.070 --> 16:34.030
of confidential
personnel information

16:34.030 --> 16:37.030
that has the potential
to hurt everyone

16:37.490 --> 16:38.530
going forward.

16:40.450 --> 16:41.500
Also...

16:43.330 --> 16:44.290
I brought cupcakes.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.750
‐I think she's full of shit.
‐And her cupcakes suck.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.800
Well, when they brought her
in to "fix" Coche,

16:51.800 --> 16:53.930
20 percent of their staff
got laid off.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.180
Rachel: If she really wants
to "fix" all the ways
that we're oppressed,

16:56.180 --> 16:58.350
why does she care who published
the men's salaries?

16:58.350 --> 17:00.010
And why'd she take me
off my app?

17:00.010 --> 17:01.720
Casey: This is why
I didn't want anything

17:01.720 --> 17:04.060
to do with leaking
the salary information online.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.270
I‐I knew this would happen.

17:06.270 --> 17:07.359
They can't prove
that we did it.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.150
Other than we stood up
and said we did it.

17:09.150 --> 17:11.780
Mariana:
Okay, we just say that
we were doing it to protect

17:11.780 --> 17:13.609
Angela from losing her job.
Which is true.

17:13.609 --> 17:15.780
Yeah. And then
she lost her job anyway.

17:15.780 --> 17:18.030
Mariana's right.
If we all stick together,
they can't fire all of us.

17:18.869 --> 17:20.990
Well, they will if we don't
get back to work.

17:24.829 --> 17:26.119
Hey, Claire?

17:26.119 --> 17:28.290
Um, I wanted to talk
next steps on the launch.

17:28.290 --> 17:30.040
Oh, we're retooling
the donation interface.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.510
We should be cranking
through QA.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.840
I think retooling
is the priority,
since QA will flag it.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.470
Well, we don't know that.

17:37.470 --> 17:39.470
Well, I had to make
the call on the spot.

17:39.470 --> 17:41.810
And since you're not
officially on the team...

17:42.600 --> 17:44.310
‐It's still my app.
‐Of course.

17:44.930 --> 17:46.140
We just might not
always have time

17:46.140 --> 17:48.190
to run everything
past you on the DL.

17:48.190 --> 17:50.730
Of course. But you know
I'm always a text away.

17:50.730 --> 17:52.780
Of course.
If there's time to text.

17:52.780 --> 17:53.690
Of course.

17:57.950 --> 17:58.910
(sighs)

17:58.910 --> 18:00.200
(knock at door)

18:08.120 --> 18:09.040
You wanna get drunk?

18:16.420 --> 18:17.510
That's new.

18:20.470 --> 18:22.680
I can't believe Claire is
making all of these decisions

18:22.680 --> 18:25.100
about my app
without even asking me. Oh!

18:25.100 --> 18:26.100
Sorry.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.890
Why are we
in the supply closet?

18:29.310 --> 18:31.860
Because everyone's having
secret meetings on the roof now.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.150
‐Ohh. Bummer.
‐I know.

18:33.820 --> 18:35.150
It was our place.

18:35.150 --> 18:37.070
Well, after it was mine
and Callie's place,

18:37.070 --> 18:38.240
but now we have
no places.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.700
Have you two talked?

18:40.160 --> 18:40.990
Don't change the subject.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.950
I bet you could get your app
back if you just told Kendra

18:43.950 --> 18:45.790
where you got
the salary information.

18:45.790 --> 18:48.120
‐I can't throw Angela
under the bus.
‐What about Evan?

18:48.120 --> 18:49.330
Why would I throw him
under the bus?

18:49.330 --> 18:52.170
He knows that you posted
the salaries online, right?

18:52.170 --> 18:53.590
Aren't you worried
he'll tell Kendra?

18:53.590 --> 18:54.500
He wouldn't do that.

18:54.920 --> 18:55.880
Have you heard from him?

18:56.460 --> 18:57.300
No.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.720
I haven't seen him

18:58.720 --> 19:00.340
and he hasn't answered
any of my texts.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.760
I just thought that
Amanda had feelings for him.

19:04.140 --> 19:06.220
I know, "you told me so."

19:06.220 --> 19:08.060
Hey, you live,
you learn.

19:08.520 --> 19:09.890
Maybe if I just talked
to Amanda‐‐

19:09.890 --> 19:10.980
Or you don't learn.

19:10.980 --> 19:12.730
Okay. Well, I have
to talk to Evan.

19:12.730 --> 19:15.150
'Cause if he's against me,
I'm done here.

19:15.150 --> 19:15.980
(latch rattling)

19:16.900 --> 19:17.990
Uh...

19:19.070 --> 19:20.030

Yeah. No, thanks!

20:56.420 --> 20:58.000

Well, back at you.

21:47.220 --> 21:49.930
<i>♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪</i>

21:51.760 --> 21:53.560
He wasn't responding
to my texts or calls

21:53.560 --> 21:55.020
since yesterday afternoon.

21:55.020 --> 21:56.140
So I came over,

21:56.140 --> 21:58.270
and I could hear
his phone ringing inside.

21:58.270 --> 22:00.690
That's when I called the police
to do a wellness check.

22:04.530 --> 22:07.570
‐Wilson: <i>Where was he?</i>
‐Detective: <i>He was found</i>
<i>by officers in his bed,</i>

22:07.570 --> 22:09.030
deceased.

22:09.030 --> 22:10.700
There was a small pill bag
on the table

22:10.700 --> 22:12.160
and alcohol
in the refrigerator.

22:18.750 --> 22:20.080
Do you know
the passcode to this?

22:20.380 --> 22:21.290
No.

22:23.420 --> 22:24.960
Are you checking
the pill bag for prints?

22:24.960 --> 22:26.050
There's no sign of foul play.

22:26.050 --> 22:28.180
Someone sold
the drugs to my son.

22:28.840 --> 22:31.350
That person can be charged
with second degree murder
or manslaughter.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.140
With no proof of tampering,
legally I can't‐‐

22:33.140 --> 22:34.930
Don't tell me about the law.
I'm a federal judge!

22:43.230 --> 22:44.570
Sorry to keep you waiting.

22:44.570 --> 22:46.360
I was just dealing
with tenant issues.

22:46.820 --> 22:48.070
Toilets again?

22:48.070 --> 22:50.740
Yeah. I should be
buying stock in plungers.

22:51.490 --> 22:52.450
I see you met Sumi?

22:52.870 --> 22:55.950
Um, I just, uh, popped in
to give you my rent check

22:55.950 --> 22:58.120
and... Lindsay Brady!

22:59.620 --> 23:01.920
I was just telling them how
we've been huge fans of theirs

23:01.920 --> 23:03.000
since the early Insta days!

23:03.000 --> 23:04.250
And now you're famous!

23:05.170 --> 23:06.260
I mean,
I'm not that famous.

23:06.260 --> 23:07.760
Although I do get mistaken

23:07.760 --> 23:08.800
for James Dean
every now and then,

23:08.800 --> 23:10.630
which is cool
because he's very hot.

23:10.630 --> 23:12.510
But weird,
because he's very dead.

23:16.970 --> 23:19.100
Cool. Cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.640
Uh, you know,
we actually have

23:20.640 --> 23:21.980
a bit to work on.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.480
Yeah. We're going
on the road together.
I'm opening.

23:25.020 --> 23:27.070
They're closing.
We're like a door.

23:27.070 --> 23:28.240
But we don't swing!

23:28.240 --> 23:30.530
‐Where's the show?
Maybe I'll come.
‐Sacramento.

23:30.990 --> 23:32.530
You hate long drives.

23:33.070 --> 23:34.120
She gets car sick.

23:34.120 --> 23:35.410
Not when I'm driving.

23:35.410 --> 23:38.000
Uh, what about, you know,
all those hoed fields

23:38.000 --> 23:39.250
on the way that depress you,
you know,

23:39.250 --> 23:41.420
remember your
existential crisis on
the way to Bakersfield?

23:41.920 --> 23:43.250
Oh, right.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.920
Maybe I could
take the train.
I love trains.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.170
She does love trains.

23:48.710 --> 23:50.090
Lindsay: Well, let me know.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.300
We'll have to put you
on the list.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.510
Okay, I will.

23:59.140 --> 24:02.100
Uh... the check is
on your desk.

24:04.020 --> 24:05.020
‐See you later.
‐Mm‐hmm.

24:08.730 --> 24:09.690
What's her deal?

24:09.990 --> 24:11.820
She's my ex.

24:12.860 --> 24:13.990
Would it be weird
if I asked her out?

24:16.080 --> 24:20.120
I mean, she just pulled this
runaway bride thing recently,

24:20.500 --> 24:22.790
so I don't know
if she's ready to jump into

24:22.790 --> 24:24.500
‐anything quite yet.
‐(cell phone buzzing)

24:28.920 --> 24:31.470
<i>This is for all</i>
<i>my fat bitches!</i>

24:31.970 --> 24:33.130
<i>Where you at?</i>

24:34.090 --> 24:35.890
<i>♪ It all started in school ♪</i>

24:35.890 --> 24:38.140

24:42.810 --> 24:44.600
This is coming together
really well.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.190
‐Thanks to you.
‐No problem.

24:47.020 --> 24:48.980
Who exactly are we
clapping back at?

24:51.190 --> 24:53.400
‐ Do you remember Jeff?
‐Mm‐hmm.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.530
(song continues on screen)

24:55.530 --> 24:56.820
Okay, well,
he was married.

24:58.120 --> 24:59.540
And I did a shitty thing

24:59.540 --> 25:00.910
by having an affair with him.

25:00.910 --> 25:01.950
I totally own that, but...

25:02.910 --> 25:06.040
his wife called me
a fat bitch on social.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.750
Hmm.

25:08.250 --> 25:10.170
'Cause people think
calling you fat

25:10.170 --> 25:11.960
is the worst thing
that they can call you.

25:13.050 --> 25:16.930
Breaking up a marriage
is a moral failing,

25:17.970 --> 25:19.890
but being fat is not.

25:19.890 --> 25:21.930
And it took me a while
to understand that.

25:21.930 --> 25:23.560
And to love myself.

25:24.230 --> 25:26.190
Lately I've been letting
my mom and...

25:27.150 --> 25:29.270
other negative voices
get through.

25:30.110 --> 25:32.280
So this clapback...

25:33.070 --> 25:34.400
is really to me.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.030
I don't know how to keep
the negative voices out.

25:39.030 --> 25:40.990
My negative voices.

25:42.790 --> 25:44.870
Why do you get up
every morning?

25:44.870 --> 25:47.040
Uh, I have
to get to work?

25:48.000 --> 25:49.130
That's not good enough.

25:49.750 --> 25:51.250
What feeds your soul?

25:57.220 --> 25:58.390
My art.

25:58.970 --> 26:00.010
Okay, then.

26:01.060 --> 26:04.480
So I had to work really hard
to love my body,

26:05.270 --> 26:07.690
you have to work really hard
to love your art.

26:08.060 --> 26:11.270
'Cause the only way to silence
those voices is to love yourself

26:11.270 --> 26:12.690
and what you do.

26:12.690 --> 26:13.980
Just commit.

26:15.650 --> 26:16.950
Take charge
of your own destiny.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.030
Hmm.

26:21.830 --> 26:22.660
Evan.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.160
‐Can I speak with you?
‐Busy at the moment.

26:26.160 --> 26:28.330
But you can schedule an
appointment with my assistant.

26:30.460 --> 26:32.710
Uh, excuse me.
When is Evan available?

26:33.710 --> 26:35.090
How about the 10th?

26:35.920 --> 26:37.130
Today's the 11th.

26:37.590 --> 26:38.550
Uh‐huh.

26:57.070 --> 26:58.360
Wilson:
<i>I have to go home</i>
<i>and tell my wife</i>

26:58.360 --> 26:59.780
<i>our son is dead.</i>

27:05.620 --> 27:06.950
Do you want me
to drive you?

27:06.950 --> 27:08.000
No.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.340
Thanks for getting me here.

27:15.500 --> 27:16.550
It means a lot.

27:20.550 --> 27:24.470
(gasping)

27:25.310 --> 27:26.930
(crying)

27:31.940 --> 27:33.150
(cell phone buzzes)

27:42.570 --> 27:43.910
Let me know what you
intend on keeping

27:43.910 --> 27:45.030
since I paid for most
of this stuff.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.040
I'm sorry I left you
a note.

27:50.660 --> 27:52.580
I just thought
it would be easier

27:52.580 --> 27:53.920
if we didn't make
a big deal about it.

27:54.250 --> 27:56.000
And you're really ready
to move in with Jamie?

27:56.000 --> 27:57.590
That's like,
next step, marriage.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.670
No. It's only temporary.

28:01.050 --> 28:03.550
Until I pass the bar
and can afford my own place.

28:05.010 --> 28:05.970
Oh.

28:08.600 --> 28:11.020
It's obvious we both need
our own spaces.

28:11.980 --> 28:12.940
Yeah, obviously.

28:16.270 --> 28:18.610
I can leave my shoes
wherever I want.
That'll be nice.

28:21.530 --> 28:25.120
Um, what was that text
you sent me about earlier?

28:25.120 --> 28:26.950
I was at work
so I couldn't answer.

28:27.490 --> 28:29.200
Oh, yeah,
that was nothing.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.290
I found someone else
to talk to.

28:37.250 --> 28:38.250
(buzzing)

28:42.840 --> 28:44.260
Hello.

28:44.260 --> 28:46.010
I hope they put me
in the orange jumpsuit

28:46.010 --> 28:48.760
and not the nasty
khaki scrubs kind.

28:49.140 --> 28:51.020
This face needs
jewel tones to thrive.

28:52.270 --> 28:53.980
You are not going
to prison.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.310
I screwed everything up.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.530
Everything.

29:01.780 --> 29:02.950
Is that why
you came to me?

29:03.450 --> 29:04.910
One screw‐up
to another?

29:06.740 --> 29:07.990
It's gonna be okay.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.080
I thought
I'd be done in time.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.960
You knew there was
a risk of getting arrested

29:14.500 --> 29:15.830
and you still went.

29:15.830 --> 29:17.500
On the night
of meeting my family.

29:17.500 --> 29:19.460
Look, I really had
no idea that Judge Wilson‐‐

29:19.460 --> 29:20.500
Malika...

29:21.210 --> 29:23.380
I've tried my hardest
to show up for you.

29:25.220 --> 29:26.340
You haven't made it easy,

29:26.340 --> 29:27.970
but I've shown you
that you could count on me.

29:28.890 --> 29:31.390
And I wanted to think that
I could count on you and that
you would show up for me.

29:31.390 --> 29:32.640
I will.
I want to.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.520
It's just that Melina
asked me specifically‐‐

29:34.520 --> 29:35.980
I asked you specifically.

29:38.190 --> 29:40.020
It was my dad's birthday,
Malika.

29:41.690 --> 29:43.860
I know activism's
important to you,

29:43.860 --> 29:45.030
and I'm not telling you
to drop it.

29:45.030 --> 29:47.030
But I just need to know
that when it counts,

29:47.030 --> 29:48.410
that we come first.

29:53.500 --> 29:54.660
We do.

30:00.170 --> 30:01.170
I, I just...

30:04.010 --> 30:05.220
I just don't think
I believe you.

30:09.220 --> 30:11.510

I'm in love with you.

31:03.110 --> 31:04.440
(clicks tongue)
Stop that!

31:05.610 --> 31:06.820
I mean it.

31:12.990 --> 31:14.990
Sometimes when I feel like
I'm about to lose my mind,

31:14.990 --> 31:17.950
I bang on my drums
until my hands bleed.

31:21.170 --> 31:22.170
Show me.

31:33.680 --> 31:34.850
(exhales heavily)

31:38.020 --> 31:38.980
Okay!

31:39.230 --> 31:40.640
Ah!

31:40.640 --> 31:42.400
Yeah!

31:42.400 --> 31:44.020
Whoo!

31:44.820 --> 31:46.440
‐Yeah!
‐Yeah!

31:47.610 --> 31:49.150
‐Ohh!
‐You wanna try?

31:49.150 --> 31:50.070
‐Yes.
‐Yeah.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.660
(yelling)

32:07.590 --> 32:08.920
(lock beeps)

32:19.060 --> 32:20.100
Jude.

32:21.810 --> 32:22.770
Hey.

32:24.310 --> 32:25.310
What are you doing here?

32:27.020 --> 32:28.320
Jamie called me.

32:41.290 --> 32:43.000
I don't remember
the moment they told us

32:43.000 --> 32:44.210
that Mom was dead.

32:46.210 --> 32:47.710
I'll never forget it.

32:48.380 --> 32:50.010
Police at our door.

32:51.510 --> 32:53.010
I was mad at her

32:53.010 --> 32:54.130
before they went out.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.510
Wouldn't let her
kiss me goodbye.

33:01.220 --> 33:03.020
And then, we never
saw her again.

33:05.730 --> 33:08.360
You know, loss is hard enough,
but it's the shock,

33:09.020 --> 33:10.570
like, when
it happens suddenly,

33:11.610 --> 33:12.990
it just stays with you,

33:13.610 --> 33:15.070
forever I think.

33:16.870 --> 33:18.580
Wilson must be
devastated.

33:19.330 --> 33:20.450
He is.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.250
You have to promise me

33:27.960 --> 33:29.090
that you won't take
any drugs.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.050
Because you can't trust

33:31.760 --> 33:32.960
where these pills
are coming from

33:32.960 --> 33:34.090
or what is in them.

33:34.090 --> 33:36.930
Dealers are lacing
everything,

33:36.930 --> 33:40.060
coke, meth,
even weed with Fentanyl

33:40.060 --> 33:41.810
to get people addicted
to opioids.

33:41.810 --> 33:45.060
And it only takes
the tiniest dose,

33:45.060 --> 33:47.810
like, the equivalent
of a couple grains
of sand to kill you.

33:48.100 --> 33:50.020
You pass out
and you stop breathing.

33:50.020 --> 33:51.980
It is not worth
risking your life.

33:51.980 --> 33:55.030
You have to swear to me
that you will not use anything.

33:56.910 --> 33:57.990
I swear.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.700
Hey, I'm gonna turn in.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.370
‐Okay.
‐Good night.

34:05.370 --> 34:06.160
Hmm. Bye.

34:07.170 --> 34:08.120
Hey.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.340
Ah, nice place
to call home.

34:18.340 --> 34:19.929
(both chuckle)

34:20.929 --> 34:23.560
So what happened
with Mariana?

34:25.889 --> 34:27.060
We just need
a little space.

34:29.060 --> 34:30.270
Never needed space before.

34:31.150 --> 34:32.440
Yeah, well, we're not
in high school anymore.

34:33.110 --> 34:34.360
We're adults.

34:34.360 --> 34:36.280
So this is you adulting?

34:41.159 --> 34:42.120
Want to have
a sleepover?

34:45.699 --> 34:46.659
Sure.

34:49.080 --> 34:50.960
‐(telephone ringing)
‐(indistinct chatter)

34:55.670 --> 34:57.470
(inaudible)

34:57.470 --> 34:59.340
Claire: (laughing)
Yeah.

35:02.260 --> 35:03.350
I'll talk to you later.

35:05.390 --> 35:06.560
Mariana!

35:07.270 --> 35:08.310
Hi.

35:08.980 --> 35:10.100
I was hoping
we could schedule

35:10.100 --> 35:11.940
a time to chat
tomorrow afternoon,

35:11.940 --> 35:13.480
after I've spoken
to everyone else?

35:15.230 --> 35:16.190
O‐of course.

35:16.740 --> 35:18.950
And let me know who you want
to make the acting team leader

35:18.950 --> 35:20.570
of your app until we get
this all sorted out.

35:20.570 --> 35:21.990
I get to choose?

35:21.990 --> 35:24.120
Of course,
it's still your baby.

35:25.700 --> 35:26.700
Gael,

35:27.120 --> 35:28.540
I'm ready for you,
if you are.

35:29.750 --> 35:30.830
Sure.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.880
Look, I'm sure that we'll
get this all cleared up

35:36.880 --> 35:38.050
in the next few days.

35:38.050 --> 35:39.170
But in the meantime,

35:39.170 --> 35:40.340
we've assigned you
to another team

35:40.340 --> 35:41.640
to help out.

35:43.350 --> 35:44.510
Which one?

35:45.760 --> 35:47.770
♪♪

36:01.530 --> 36:03.160
You want me
to be team leader?

36:03.160 --> 36:04.160
Interim leader.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.120
What about Claire?

36:05.120 --> 36:06.200
I don't trust her right now.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.040
Evan hates me.
All I have is my app.

36:08.700 --> 36:09.830
The launch needs
to be perfect.

36:09.830 --> 36:11.670
You're the only one I know
who'll make sure it is.

36:11.960 --> 36:13.000
Please.

36:13.630 --> 36:14.580
(sighs)

36:14.580 --> 36:15.460
(Alex sighs)

36:15.460 --> 36:16.800
Welcome back, Mary Ana.

36:17.210 --> 36:18.840
Sam: We've missed you.

36:26.930 --> 36:29.020
Alex:
Although I suspect
it'll be a short stay

36:29.020 --> 36:31.270
once Kendra finds out
you're "Spartacus."

36:31.850 --> 36:34.400
Wait, I thought that
no one was Spartacus.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.440
God, no.
No one who says they're
Spartacus is Spartacus.

36:37.900 --> 36:39.820
How many times do I have
to explain this movie to you?

36:40.820 --> 36:43.240
Um, how long do think
the "Byte Club" girls
will have your back

36:43.240 --> 36:46.120
now that you've made a man
their team leader?

36:46.530 --> 36:48.160
Is he a man?

36:48.160 --> 36:50.250
Alex:
Well, I think that's
how he "identifies."

36:50.250 --> 36:51.370
(reggae music playing
over earphones)

36:51.370 --> 36:53.960
(conversation continues,
indistinct)

37:01.970 --> 37:03.130
(beeps)

37:05.890 --> 37:09.010
(beeping)

37:13.270 --> 37:15.730
So Sumi met Lindsay,

37:15.730 --> 37:16.810
and now she wants
their number.

37:16.810 --> 37:18.060
But that's weird, right?

37:18.610 --> 37:20.070
I don't know,
do you want Sumi?

37:20.610 --> 37:21.740
No.

37:21.740 --> 37:22.990
‐Do you want Lindsay?
‐No.

37:23.490 --> 37:25.070
Okay. Then, why not?

37:25.360 --> 37:26.950
Especially if you're worried
that Lindsay's into you.

37:26.950 --> 37:28.990
You can't tell anyone
that I told you that.

37:28.990 --> 37:31.540
Hey, I'm not the one
going around tellin' people

37:31.540 --> 37:32.830
other people are
in love with them

37:32.830 --> 37:34.960
and then it turns out
that they're not.

37:36.670 --> 37:38.040
How are things
with Dennis?

37:39.000 --> 37:41.050
Weird.
Thank you.

37:41.550 --> 37:43.260
‐Sorry.
‐Look‐‐

37:43.260 --> 37:45.430
If you really want Lindsay
to step back,

37:45.840 --> 37:46.930
then there's no better way

37:46.930 --> 37:48.930
than to fix them up
with someone else.

37:50.140 --> 37:52.060
If that's what you really want.

37:52.060 --> 37:53.390
Of course it is.

37:54.060 --> 37:55.350
I love Joey.

38:00.270 --> 38:01.520
(cell phone beeps)

38:04.030 --> 38:05.150
(sighs)

38:05.150 --> 38:06.610
‐Hey.
‐Hey.

38:06.610 --> 38:08.240
I didn't hear you come
to bed last night.

38:09.530 --> 38:11.370
‐Is Jude here?
‐No, he left.

38:16.330 --> 38:18.960
‐Thank you for calling him.
‐Yeah.

38:19.170 --> 38:21.500
How do you always know
exactly what I need?

38:21.500 --> 38:23.300
Well, I guess I'm just
the perfect boyfriend.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.010
‐No, you definitely are.
‐Hmm.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.930
So...

38:31.930 --> 38:34.770
we didn't finish
our conversation
the other night.

38:34.770 --> 38:36.180
I'm aware.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.390
I do love you.

38:43.570 --> 38:45.150
‐And...
‐Mm‐hmm.

38:45.150 --> 38:46.150
maybe...

38:46.900 --> 38:49.490
this, um,
living situation

38:49.490 --> 38:50.990
doesn't have
to be temporary?

38:55.700 --> 38:57.460
I wish we could take this
back to the bed,

38:57.460 --> 38:58.620
but I have a meeting,

38:59.460 --> 39:01.580
‐and I gotta shower‐‐
‐Yeah, you definitely
need to shower.

39:01.580 --> 39:02.790
Yeah.

39:09.930 --> 39:11.090
(laughs)

39:11.090 --> 39:13.640
(cell phone ringing)

39:19.060 --> 39:20.440
Judge Wilson,
how are you?

39:20.440 --> 39:22.400
Wilson on phone: <i>I'm okay.</i>
<i>I need a favor.</i>

39:23.020 --> 39:24.520
<i>There's a friend of Tate's</i>
<i>who I think knows</i>

39:24.520 --> 39:25.690
<i>where he got the pills.</i>

39:26.780 --> 39:28.610
‐Where are you?
‐I'm on my way to court.

39:28.610 --> 39:29.450
Callie: <i>You're at work?</i>

39:30.110 --> 39:31.320
Wilson:
<i>I have a trial. Listen...</i>

39:32.370 --> 39:34.030
this friend
will never speak to me.

39:34.490 --> 39:35.620
But he might
open up to you.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.370
<i>His name is Graham.</i>
<i>I'm gonna text you</i>
<i>his number, okay?</i>

39:39.910 --> 39:40.960

in general about your job

40:38.470 --> 40:39.890
here at Speckulate.

40:39.890 --> 40:41.520
Actually, not good.

40:42.350 --> 40:45.190
Graphic design isn't
what I really want to do.

40:46.270 --> 40:47.190
I'm an artist.
