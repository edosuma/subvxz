11:27.211 --> 11:29.336
Well, I'll be damned.

11:30.098 --> 11:33.340
Right there.
Ascending aortic dissection.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.027
His right coronary artery
takes off anomalously

11:36.254 --> 11:37.437
from his ascending aorta.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.272
Which means
when he had the dissection,

11:39.424 --> 11:41.032
he also had an inferior MI.

11:41.184 --> 11:44.351
That is... that is
a one-in-a-million diagnosis.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.262
How the hell
did he figure that out?

11:46.355 --> 11:48.355
LEONARD:
Observation

11:48.375 --> 11:49.766
and experience.

11:49.859 --> 11:51.601
Sir, you should be back
in your bed.

11:51.619 --> 11:54.620
-You're not well.
-A type 1A dissection.

11:54.773 --> 11:57.273
A Perry-1A, to be exact.

11:57.292 --> 12:00.626
Named after you because you're
the one who categorized it.

12:00.779 --> 12:03.780
Well, are you ready to repair

12:03.798 --> 12:06.616
a Perry-1A dissection on Perry?

12:06.634 --> 12:10.470
Let's... take a moment to figure
out the best course of action.

12:10.622 --> 12:11.471
Yeah?

12:11.623 --> 12:13.122
Sure.

12:13.216 --> 12:14.733
Sure, he's right, Dr. Perry.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.642
Let's get you back
to an ICU bed.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.028
Okay?

12:21.299 --> 12:22.482
You get called
to the execution?

12:22.576 --> 12:24.467
-Sorry, what?
-You didn't see the email?

12:24.560 --> 12:26.244
We're all supposed
to meet with Voss.

12:26.471 --> 12:30.139
Chastain's level 1 trauma center
is closing. Tonight.

12:30.233 --> 12:31.916
Whoa.
That is a huge loss.

12:31.993 --> 12:33.752
No more helicopters
on the roof,

12:33.903 --> 12:35.478
no more trauma team activations.

12:35.497 --> 12:37.571
-Fewer doctors,
nurses, surgeons.
-(sighs)

12:37.591 --> 12:38.998
It makes you think
what's next?

12:39.150 --> 12:40.483
Cath lab? Transplant?

12:40.502 --> 12:41.985
We're gonna be a nine-to-five
urgent care clinic

12:42.078 --> 12:43.002
before you know it.

12:43.154 --> 12:44.003
Prepare for a thrilling future

12:44.172 --> 12:45.579
of nonspecific abdominal pain

12:45.657 --> 12:47.840
-and tingly arms and legs.
-(cart clattering)

12:47.993 --> 12:49.250
What do we got?

12:49.269 --> 12:50.584
Unidentified woman.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.270
Witnesses say she got into
a violent altercation

12:52.497 --> 12:53.587
with a purse thief.

12:53.681 --> 12:55.181
Closed head injury
and thrown to the ground.

12:55.333 --> 12:56.849
-Femur looks broken.
-IRVING:
All right, let's take her

12:57.002 --> 12:58.684
-to Trauma 12.
-DEVON: Hello, ma'am,

12:58.837 --> 13:00.612
I'm Dr. Pravesh,
and you are at

13:00.763 --> 13:02.096
Chastain Hospital.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.097
Do you remember what happened?

13:03.174 --> 13:04.282
My purse.

13:04.433 --> 13:05.766
She wandered out of
the dementia unit?

13:05.860 --> 13:07.118
It's possible.
I have no clue.

13:07.270 --> 13:09.570
She's pretty banged up,
but protecting her airway,

13:09.697 --> 13:11.272
and her vitals are stable.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.366
Let's get a full set of labs
and get her to CT

13:13.535 --> 13:14.292
as soon as we can.

13:14.519 --> 13:15.609
At her age and degree of trauma,

13:15.629 --> 13:17.687
she could have injured
just about anything.

13:17.747 --> 13:19.539
He needs emergent surgery.

13:19.615 --> 13:22.358
His mortality's increasing
one percent

13:22.377 --> 13:23.468
-every hour we wait.
-But at his age,

13:23.619 --> 13:25.119
and with the extent
of involvement

13:25.213 --> 13:26.879
of his aorta, and the hit
his heart's already taken,

13:27.032 --> 13:29.215
the mortality for that surgery's
over 50%.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.626
-So what's the alternative,
conservative management?
-Yes.

13:32.646 --> 13:33.961
But we keep strict tabs

13:34.055 --> 13:35.963
on his heart rate
and blood pressure.

13:36.057 --> 13:37.707
And hope the tear
in his aorta clots off.

13:37.725 --> 13:39.150
It's a long shot
and still risky.

13:39.302 --> 13:41.635
He said it himself.
It's a Type-1A Gray Zone.

13:41.729 --> 13:44.489
Medical management and surgery
have similar outcomes.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.065
All right, so we have to
convince the man

13:46.217 --> 13:48.568
who created the surgery
not to have the surgery,

13:48.720 --> 13:51.162
and hope the world's
most famous heart surgeon

13:51.389 --> 13:53.998
doesn't die in Chastain today.

13:55.318 --> 13:57.460
Right.

14:03.659 --> 14:06.252
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:06.404 --> 14:08.087
Heard Leonard Perry's here.
How is he?

14:08.239 --> 14:12.592
Well, he's hanging in there,
but it's not great.

14:12.686 --> 14:16.503
Um, so Kit wants me to move out
all the ICU patients that I can.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.747
What? Why?

14:17.765 --> 14:19.932
Budget issues, I'm assuming.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.268
I found a good candidate.
Amir Sheridan.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.936
The kid with the fentanyl
poisoning?

14:24.030 --> 14:25.588
-I thought he was improving.
-He's not.

14:25.681 --> 14:27.090
But he's alive.

14:27.092 --> 14:28.682
Neuro says wait a year
before they give up on him,

14:28.702 --> 14:30.017
but he can't stay here.

14:30.261 --> 14:32.778
(scoffs) So we have to find
a skilled nursing facility

14:32.873 --> 14:34.097
-that will take him.
-Yes.

14:34.115 --> 14:35.098
Which will not be an easy task,

14:35.116 --> 14:36.541
and it's all yours.

14:37.435 --> 14:39.268
Someone needs to talk
to his family,

14:39.362 --> 14:40.770
and it should probably
be his surgeon.

14:40.863 --> 14:43.631
-Billie.
-Can you give that
to her, please?

14:47.629 --> 14:50.096
Hey, you got some time
for a trauma patient?

14:53.284 --> 14:54.784
Go for it. Distract me.

14:54.802 --> 14:57.470
-What was that?
-A mess.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.398
I get it. If you ever want
to talk, I'm here.

15:01.309 --> 15:03.735
I got to say, though,
we all knew it was coming.

15:05.146 --> 15:08.448
Kit and Bell's wedding?
Everybody saw it.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.242
Everybody but me, I guess.

15:11.469 --> 15:15.163
Hi. Can you tell us
your name, ma'am?

15:16.416 --> 15:17.640
You first.

15:17.659 --> 15:20.567
This is Lillian,
and she's a real fighter.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.087
She took on a guy who
tried to snatch her purse.

15:23.239 --> 15:25.423
Lillian... something.

15:26.242 --> 15:28.242
I can't remember the rest of it.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.835
-Bizarre.
-Lillian,

15:29.988 --> 15:31.912
-I'm Dr. Hawkins.
-What time is it?

15:32.081 --> 15:34.098
I need to make sure
that I let the dog out.

15:34.325 --> 15:35.266
(pained cry)

15:35.418 --> 15:38.770
No. I need you to stay
right here, okay?

15:38.997 --> 15:40.563
Stay here.

15:43.835 --> 15:45.944
Can you keep an eye
on her for me?

15:46.171 --> 15:47.779
She's been this disoriented
the whole time?

15:47.930 --> 15:49.839
She's clearing up a bit,
but not much.

15:49.857 --> 15:52.450
Any explanation for her
confusion on her workup?

15:52.677 --> 15:55.344
Possible Alzheimer's, but her
urine is clearly infected.

15:55.363 --> 15:57.288
She's dehydrated, sodium at 150.

15:57.440 --> 16:00.274
She's in pain from
a broken femur, but listen.

16:00.368 --> 16:03.461
What's really concerning me
is this.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.521
Mm.

16:05.523 --> 16:07.614
Acute on-chronic subdural.
That's pretty big.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.635
This could be what is causing
her to be so confused.

16:10.862 --> 16:14.455
If you're asking my advice,

16:14.532 --> 16:16.382
fix her sodium, treat her UTI,

16:16.534 --> 16:18.868
-see if she clears.
-I think she needs to
get to the OR stat.

16:18.961 --> 16:22.538
Taking a woman at her age
to the OR is risky.

16:22.557 --> 16:25.466
And if it is dementia,
putting her through surgery--

16:25.560 --> 16:27.318
that-that could just
make things far worse.

16:27.470 --> 16:29.729
We have to get her to the OR
anyway for her broken leg.

16:29.805 --> 16:32.732
I say we try and treat
the bleed at the same time.

16:32.884 --> 16:34.900
Okay, so both Billie and Kit.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.477
Yes.

16:37.405 --> 16:41.390
Now, as confidant as I am in
using your surgical techniques,

16:41.484 --> 16:44.410
my recommendation would be
to carefully monitor you

16:44.562 --> 16:47.246
and hope the dissection
stabilizes.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.758
Honesty first,
among colleagues?

16:57.851 --> 17:02.261
Well, neither option is good.

17:02.413 --> 17:05.005
We believe odds slightly favor
wait and see.

17:05.099 --> 17:06.916
Slightly favor?

17:06.934 --> 17:07.917
So it's not clear.

17:07.935 --> 17:10.419
No, it's not.

17:11.230 --> 17:13.439
Given the choice between
hope and action,

17:13.591 --> 17:16.117
I've always
tended towards action.

17:17.520 --> 17:21.664
But now that I'm here,
I'm frightened.

17:28.606 --> 17:30.364
Dr. Perry,

17:30.383 --> 17:32.625
if you choose
to have the surgery,

17:32.719 --> 17:36.054
I promise you that these hands
will do everything they can

17:36.205 --> 17:37.538
to save your life.

17:37.632 --> 17:40.558
So you have it?

17:40.709 --> 17:42.060
The healing touch?

17:42.211 --> 17:44.136
Well, I don't know about that,

17:44.289 --> 17:46.213
but I do have
experience, talent,

17:46.232 --> 17:48.232
and a very big ego.

17:48.459 --> 17:51.611
That and the healing touch.

17:52.572 --> 17:56.991
That is where
I place my trust.

18:03.732 --> 18:06.809
Okay.
No watching and waiting.

18:06.828 --> 18:08.902
-We move forward.
-Yes.

18:09.071 --> 18:10.904
Together.

18:10.924 --> 18:13.240
You sure?

18:13.334 --> 18:16.928
You don't have to make
this decision right this moment.

18:17.155 --> 18:21.690
James, I have never
let fear guide me in the OR.

18:21.826 --> 18:24.102
I won't let it
steer me away now.

18:25.546 --> 18:27.980
No more half measures.

18:29.091 --> 18:31.500
I want bold action.

18:31.519 --> 18:35.113
All right.
You heard the man, James.

18:35.264 --> 18:37.006
Dr. Leonard has decided

18:37.099 --> 18:39.933
to come out the bunker
guns blazing.

18:40.027 --> 18:42.078
That's the idea.

18:43.514 --> 18:46.499
-Okay?
-Okay.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.427
(indistinct chatter)

19:01.532 --> 19:03.307
How's it going?

19:03.459 --> 19:04.809
Good.

19:05.036 --> 19:07.553
Good. Me too.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.039
Ah, so, I spoke to Cade.

19:10.057 --> 19:12.984
Been avoiding texts
from James all day.

19:14.545 --> 19:17.488
Could have done this
in a cleaner way, but...

19:18.474 --> 19:19.657
...it happened.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.994
And we are gonna do this right
from now on.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.496
I'll talk to James.

19:28.075 --> 19:31.410
I heard you're looking
to relocate Amir Sheridan.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.413
-I'm so sad he hasn't woken up.
-Yeah.

19:34.565 --> 19:35.915
We're still looking
for a facility,

19:36.009 --> 19:37.566
but I thought I'd get
the conversation started

19:37.660 --> 19:39.660
with the family. They're
coming in this afternoon.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.378
Did you want to talk to them?

19:41.455 --> 19:42.847
Well, I should.

19:42.998 --> 19:45.332
-I mean, of course I will.
-No. No, no, no.

19:45.468 --> 19:47.501
-Not after yesterday.
-I'll talk to them.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.412
Would you?

19:49.430 --> 19:51.147
Of course.

19:53.434 --> 19:54.841
I don't love how we got here,

19:54.861 --> 19:58.487
but I am so happy
that we are here.

20:00.274 --> 20:02.091
I know.

20:02.109 --> 20:04.093
Me too.

20:04.186 --> 20:05.686
(elevator bell chimes)

20:05.763 --> 20:07.914
-AJ.
-Yo.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.042
I brought you this
for good luck.

20:11.211 --> 20:13.936
It's from when I was
on Perry's team in Boston.

20:14.029 --> 20:15.379
Thanks, man.

20:15.531 --> 20:17.048
Yeah.

20:17.199 --> 20:19.792
So, listen. Obviously, Perry
is consenting for himself,

20:19.886 --> 20:21.552
but is there somebody
we should call?

20:21.704 --> 20:23.128
He's a widower, no kids.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.448
He always said his interns
were his children.

20:25.466 --> 20:28.133
Oh, wow. So I guess
you're his family now.

20:28.286 --> 20:30.728
Yeah, I guess so.

20:31.639 --> 20:33.138
Acute on-chronic subdural,

20:33.291 --> 20:35.549
broken femur
and some bruised ribs.

20:35.643 --> 20:36.734
Lillian's 84.

20:36.885 --> 20:37.977
What's she doing, playing rugby?

20:38.129 --> 20:39.812
She tried to fight off
a purse thief

20:39.964 --> 20:41.464
who then battered her
within an inch of her life.

20:41.482 --> 20:43.983
Human beings are capable
of greatness.

20:44.135 --> 20:45.910
Bravery, charity, love, decency.

20:46.061 --> 20:47.745
And yet the very same species

20:47.896 --> 20:50.473
has monsters
who do things like this.

20:50.566 --> 20:52.157
It's gonna be
a scheduling challenge.

20:52.310 --> 20:53.659
I'm trying
to ramp down the OR

20:53.753 --> 20:54.901
now that we're closing Trauma.

20:54.996 --> 20:56.996
So there's less
on-call anesthesia.

20:57.148 --> 20:59.257
Maybe if you guys double-team it

20:59.408 --> 21:00.649
you can share anesthesia?

21:00.743 --> 21:02.093
Well, the surgery's
pretty risky already.

21:02.244 --> 21:03.502
Are we sure
we want to do it at all?

21:03.671 --> 21:06.913
I see she has a possible
diagnosis of dementia.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.767
We could table
the subdural for now,

21:09.994 --> 21:11.343
get her another CT scan
in a few hours,

21:11.470 --> 21:13.420
-put her on frequent
neuro checks.
-Mm-hmm.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.755
Conrad had a similar impulse,

21:14.849 --> 21:16.849
but we have no proof that
the problem is dementia.

21:17.001 --> 21:18.501
I mean, for all we know
she could finish

21:18.519 --> 21:20.352
the Sunday<i> New York Times</i>
crossword puzzle

21:20.446 --> 21:22.280
when she doesn't have
200cc's of blood

21:22.507 --> 21:24.532
pushing on her parietal lobe.

21:25.860 --> 21:26.842
Book the OR.

21:26.861 --> 21:28.844
Okay.

21:28.863 --> 21:30.179
I don't want to lose
another patient.

21:30.197 --> 21:32.123
I understand
being risk-averse

21:32.274 --> 21:34.517
after what happened yesterday,

21:34.610 --> 21:36.685
but the patient you lost
had metastatic cancer

21:36.704 --> 21:38.129
and an unhinged family.

21:38.205 --> 21:39.446
This woman has no one but us

21:39.465 --> 21:41.948
and at least
a chance of recovery.

21:41.968 --> 21:45.177
You're right. I'm in.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.550
AUSTIN:
What's his temp?

21:51.702 --> 21:53.552
Cooled temperature is down
to 20 degrees Celsius.

21:53.704 --> 21:57.631
AUSTIN:
Ah, the tear could have
extended since.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.708
All right, we're gonna
have to stop his heart

21:59.727 --> 22:01.710
to get a good look.

22:01.729 --> 22:04.229
And the bypass machine.

22:04.324 --> 22:07.066
JESSICA:
We'll have no circulation
at all. For how long?

22:07.160 --> 22:10.644
Thirty minutes until anoxic
brain injury sets in.

22:10.738 --> 22:13.055
Maybe sooner at his age.

22:13.148 --> 22:14.390
I know this sucks,

22:14.392 --> 22:17.076
but the man said
he was all in,

22:17.170 --> 22:21.063
which means<i> we</i> are all in.

22:21.123 --> 22:22.965
Bold action.

22:23.826 --> 22:25.067
CHU:
He's at 18 degrees.

22:25.086 --> 22:26.326
Cooling goal reached.

22:26.495 --> 22:28.237
JESSICA: He's going into
hypothermia-induced V fib.

22:28.330 --> 22:31.557
AUSTIN:
Cardioplegic medication to me.

22:34.169 --> 22:36.002
And here we go.

22:36.022 --> 22:39.440
-Arrest time starting now.
-Good. Let's move.

22:51.687 --> 22:53.596
You got 25 minutes.

22:53.689 --> 22:54.947
I'm almost done.
Hopefully.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.375
The dissection took out
his whole aortic arch.

22:57.602 --> 23:00.211
Left carotid, left subclavian
and the innominate.

23:00.362 --> 23:02.213
He certainly did not
make this easy for me.

23:02.440 --> 23:05.216
JESSICA:
Not to mention the single-vessel
bypass for his RCA.

23:05.367 --> 23:08.427
The good news is
we're almost there.

23:10.406 --> 23:12.781
Damn it!
4-0 suture to me.

23:12.783 --> 23:16.209
-You are running out of time.
-AUSTIN: My OR requires everyone

23:16.229 --> 23:17.953
to be cool, calm and collected.

23:18.046 --> 23:21.640
And that includes
the observation room.

23:21.792 --> 23:24.735
All right, we are good.

23:24.962 --> 23:26.112
I'm unclamping.

23:43.314 --> 23:44.313
Yes.

23:44.331 --> 23:45.739
-Whew.
-AUSTIN: Yes.

23:45.833 --> 23:47.332
(laughing): All right.

23:47.427 --> 23:50.169
Oh...

23:50.321 --> 23:51.670
All right,
put him back on pump.

23:51.822 --> 23:54.056
(Austin laughing)

24:06.929 --> 24:10.114
(clears throat)
How's Dr. Perry?

24:10.265 --> 24:13.008
He made it through
the surgery,

24:13.027 --> 24:14.452
but that's
all we know for now.

24:15.621 --> 24:18.514
Cade, if you have a minute,
I think we should talk.

24:18.532 --> 24:20.273
I'm not sure
what there is to say.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.108
Well, we're gonna
be working together,

24:22.128 --> 24:23.961
I hope for a long time.

24:24.797 --> 24:28.281
So I want to give you the chance
to get whatever it is

24:28.301 --> 24:30.217
you're feeling off your chest.

24:34.289 --> 24:35.723
Okay.

24:50.064 --> 24:52.973
I know Conrad talked to you.

24:53.067 --> 24:54.550
I just wanted to say that

24:54.643 --> 24:56.494
-neither of us saw this coming.
-Oh, come on.

24:56.662 --> 25:00.372
You've been in love with Conrad
the entire time I've known you.

25:02.168 --> 25:06.061
I never had any intention
of taking him away from you.

25:06.897 --> 25:09.798
The dance
at Kit and Bell's wedding?

25:10.659 --> 25:12.092
Unplanned.

25:13.161 --> 25:14.494
But you're right.

25:15.256 --> 25:18.999
And I don't want you to think
that I'm the kind of person

25:19.093 --> 25:21.093
-that would swoop in...
-Look, I like you.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.686
Right now I wish I didn't,
but I do.

25:22.763 --> 25:24.246
So for what it's worth,

25:24.265 --> 25:26.431
in these types of situations,
no one does the swooping.

25:26.508 --> 25:28.692
It's kind of a two-handed game.

25:30.104 --> 25:31.937
Well, I'm not sure
Conrad's responsible

25:32.031 --> 25:35.274
for feelings he couldn't
fight or even face.

25:35.426 --> 25:36.534
Okay. (chuckles)
I didn't need that.

25:36.761 --> 25:39.762
I... I'm sorry, I'm not
finding the right words.

25:39.855 --> 25:41.613
It's fine.
I will survive.

25:41.766 --> 25:43.207
Because I know what I deserve.

25:43.434 --> 25:44.708
I deserve someone who loves me,

25:44.860 --> 25:46.210
not someone
who's working overtime

25:46.361 --> 25:48.754
to deny they love you.

25:50.608 --> 25:52.299
I really am sorry.

25:53.127 --> 25:55.594
Don't be.
It's pointless.

25:59.633 --> 26:01.300
Just so you know,

26:01.452 --> 26:03.227
Hawkins never said "I love you."

26:03.396 --> 26:05.045
Not once.

26:05.213 --> 26:07.439
Neither of us did.

26:19.728 --> 26:20.652
CHU:
Extubating now.

26:20.821 --> 26:22.154
BILLIE:
Subdural drain complete.

26:22.230 --> 26:24.323
KIT:
Perfect timing.
Just closing skin.

26:24.475 --> 26:26.083
BILLIE:
Well, I think we actually
managed to pull this off

26:26.234 --> 26:27.400
in record time.

26:27.494 --> 26:28.568
If we're good here,

26:28.662 --> 26:31.237
I was due in my next OR
ten minutes ago.

26:31.332 --> 26:33.332
I appreciate you working
with our staff cuts.

26:33.484 --> 26:34.333
Thank you, Paul.

26:34.427 --> 26:35.801
CHU:
Let OR 7 know I'm on my way.

26:35.911 --> 26:37.336
BILLIE:
I'm pretty much wrapped up here,

26:37.430 --> 26:40.080
and I should check on some
post-op patients, too.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.506
You good?

26:41.659 --> 26:42.749
Yes. Thank you, Billie.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.584
(alarm sounding)

26:44.604 --> 26:45.844
KIT:
She's in SVT.

26:45.996 --> 26:48.129
Blood pressure's tanking.
Get Paul back here.

26:48.131 --> 26:50.666
No time.
I know what to do.

26:50.759 --> 26:54.695
-I am not losing
this patient today.
-KIT: Do it.

27:04.698 --> 27:07.041
Pushing adenosine now.

27:15.376 --> 27:17.426
KIT:
She's back in sinus rhythm.

27:19.639 --> 27:20.787
Pressure's coming back up.

27:20.865 --> 27:23.641
We've got this.
Thanks, Paul.

27:23.717 --> 27:25.726
Love being irrelevant.

27:28.222 --> 27:30.130
KIT:
Nice job.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.799
Looks like someone's
made a full recovery.

27:32.893 --> 27:37.562
And I'm not talking about
our lovely patient Lillian.

27:37.657 --> 27:40.240
Turns out I survive, too.

27:42.995 --> 27:46.905
Ah. Well, you certainly
put me to the test, Dr. P.

27:46.999 --> 27:51.226
Oh, he was masterful.
Full aortic arch repair.

27:51.245 --> 27:52.561
Truly, Dr. Austin.

27:52.654 --> 27:55.005
And you're already
weaned off the pressors.

27:55.157 --> 27:56.398
Your BP's looking good.

27:56.491 --> 27:58.066
When did you do
the first arch repair--

27:58.160 --> 28:00.344
-1970?
-'69.

28:00.495 --> 28:03.347
Wow. And they didn't
have all the fancy OR tools

28:03.498 --> 28:04.923
-we have now. Can you...
-LEONARD: Aah!

28:05.017 --> 28:06.408
Oh! (groaning)

28:06.427 --> 28:07.242
What's going on?

28:07.335 --> 28:10.204
I'm dissecting again.

28:10.264 --> 28:13.339
The aorta's torn through.

28:13.417 --> 28:15.767
And we knew this could happen.

28:15.936 --> 28:17.936
-It's not your fault.
-Okay.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.179
Continue the nicardipine

28:19.198 --> 28:20.939
-and the esmolol.
-We'll do that.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.200
The man is crashing
and he's still in control.

28:23.351 --> 28:25.594
You won't be able to operate
again. This is worse.

28:25.612 --> 28:27.279
-We'll control
your blood pressure.
-(groaning)

28:27.373 --> 28:29.097
And your heart rate
and pain, okay?

28:29.116 --> 28:31.691
-You're gonna make it through.
-It was a long shot.

28:31.711 --> 28:32.710
We got you, all right?

28:32.861 --> 28:34.194
And your job is to stay calm.

28:34.288 --> 28:36.121
Once your
blood pressure spikes...

28:36.273 --> 28:40.292
I die instantly.
I'm aware. And calm.

28:40.444 --> 28:43.512
-So calm. So calm.
-AUSTIN: So calm. So calm.

28:47.542 --> 28:48.726
-Hi.
-I'm Dr. Devi.

28:48.953 --> 28:50.635
She's Padma's sister.
Is she awake?

28:50.730 --> 28:52.454
Yes.

28:52.473 --> 28:56.191
Hey, um, I think
she'd rather see you alone.

29:10.565 --> 29:12.624
Hey, Paddie.

29:15.329 --> 29:16.628
You okay?

29:19.074 --> 29:21.091
They think I'm crazy.

29:21.986 --> 29:25.337
Tomorrow you'll see
a psychiatrist,

29:25.489 --> 29:27.556
and we'll move you
to a better place.

29:28.768 --> 29:31.560
One that specializes
in postpartum depression.

29:33.330 --> 29:35.330
What would I ever do
without you?

29:35.349 --> 29:37.608
You'll never be without me.

29:39.094 --> 29:41.195
And I can't be without you.

29:43.932 --> 29:45.007
The boys.

29:45.100 --> 29:46.341
They're with Serena.

29:46.434 --> 29:49.036
AJ's gonna
go home to them soon.

29:51.515 --> 29:52.706
The worst is over.

30:00.874 --> 30:03.950
This is the beginning
of recovery.

30:04.044 --> 30:06.595
The first day of a new life.

30:26.884 --> 30:28.141
Hello, Ms. Lillian Cortland.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.309
How you feeling, my dear?

30:29.328 --> 30:31.311
I'd like some applesauce.

30:31.479 --> 30:34.164
And a clicker that gets me PBS.

30:34.391 --> 30:35.666
Because cable news
will rot your brain

30:35.817 --> 30:37.835
faster than a moldy grape
on the bottom of a fruit bowl.

30:38.062 --> 30:40.320
-Can you tell me
who our president is?
-LILLIAN: Can you tell me

30:40.339 --> 30:41.839
who all the presidents are
in order,

30:42.066 --> 30:44.341
including Millard Fillmore?
Because I can.

30:44.568 --> 30:45.734
Yeah, I get your game.

30:45.752 --> 30:47.511
I'm old, so you think
I got mush in my noggin.

30:47.662 --> 30:49.421
Hey, you were right,
I was wrong.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.756
Look at that,
a man who admits he's wrong.

30:51.909 --> 30:55.335
-Now that is a rare quality.
-(laughs)

30:55.354 --> 30:57.003
My late husband,
may he rot in hell,

30:57.097 --> 31:00.098
he never apologized
for a thing in his life.

31:00.250 --> 31:01.933
Lillian, do you remember
how you were injured?

31:02.086 --> 31:03.527
Yes, I'm fully aware.

31:03.696 --> 31:06.088
I was beaten up by a mugger
because I would not

31:06.090 --> 31:07.680
let him steal my purse.

31:07.774 --> 31:09.015
And where is it, anyway?

31:09.034 --> 31:10.567
You know what, Lillian,
we're gonna find out.

31:10.794 --> 31:12.852
We're gonna see about
that applesauce, too.

31:12.946 --> 31:14.371
And PBS.

31:17.859 --> 31:20.193
Hey.

31:20.287 --> 31:22.028
What's the latest on Dr. Perry?

31:22.047 --> 31:24.623
Well, the godfather
of cardiothoracic surgery

31:24.775 --> 31:27.200
did not die in my OR.

31:27.219 --> 31:30.612
But his outcome is uncertain.

31:30.631 --> 31:32.639
How are you?

31:35.377 --> 31:36.876
There's something we should
probably discuss,

31:36.896 --> 31:39.304
but, you know,
we can also talk later.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.398
No, no, no, no,
don't do that to me.

31:41.549 --> 31:43.549
Sit. Talk.

31:43.644 --> 31:45.986
I could use the company.

31:51.485 --> 31:53.151
It's about Padma.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.579
Did she make it home?

31:55.730 --> 31:58.657
I certainly hope so,
because this absent mom thing

31:58.751 --> 32:00.626
is getting real old.

32:03.163 --> 32:07.149
Padma is struggling with
acute postpartum depression,

32:07.167 --> 32:10.510
and she was suicidal.

32:13.490 --> 32:15.098
Suicidal?

32:17.494 --> 32:20.145
She almost threw herself
off a bridge.

32:22.182 --> 32:24.516
She came to me and Devon
for help, and now she's here

32:24.668 --> 32:27.836
-on a temporary
psychiatric hold.
-Can I see her?

32:27.854 --> 32:30.338
No, no. Not yet.

32:30.432 --> 32:34.034
She doesn't want to face you.
She's ashamed.

32:35.621 --> 32:39.456
Wow, I knew it was bad.
I-I didn't know it was that bad.

32:40.534 --> 32:43.502
Devon said no one saw it
because Padma didn't want us to.

32:46.039 --> 32:48.023
What about the boys?

32:48.116 --> 32:49.691
Once she's better,
she'll be there for them.

32:49.710 --> 32:51.359
Uh, no, we don't know that.

32:51.361 --> 32:54.471
Lots of mothers
go through this.

32:54.622 --> 32:56.881
Now at least
she's getting help.

32:57.034 --> 32:59.226
What if they're
not safe with her?

33:03.816 --> 33:07.225
She loves those little boys.
She does.

33:07.302 --> 33:08.986
She's just feeling inadequate
right now, like she...

33:09.062 --> 33:11.046
she doesn't deserve
to be their mother,

33:11.064 --> 33:12.990
or she's overwhelmed,
I don't know.

33:13.141 --> 33:14.807
Right. Right.

33:14.827 --> 33:16.901
It's, um, it's-it's biochemical.

33:16.996 --> 33:18.720
It's hormonal.

33:18.722 --> 33:20.905
There are a lot of things
that factor into this.

33:21.058 --> 33:22.666
And it can be treated.

33:24.077 --> 33:27.320
Look, she really needs
our support right now. Okay?

33:27.414 --> 33:30.549
So please, please
don't turn on her.

33:34.905 --> 33:36.680
I won't.

33:38.425 --> 33:40.559
I can't.

33:53.106 --> 33:56.424
-Hey.
-Hey.

33:56.518 --> 33:59.745
I hear you're having
a rough day.

34:01.523 --> 34:02.597
I am.

34:02.616 --> 34:04.933
How's Dr. Perry?

34:04.951 --> 34:07.127
We don't know.

34:08.455 --> 34:11.048
He dissected again.
He could still pull through.

34:11.275 --> 34:14.718
His tear could stabilize,
but it's out of our hands now.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.795
I'm so sorry.

34:16.947 --> 34:20.632
Hey, before you say
whatever you're about to say,

34:20.801 --> 34:22.601
I think I already know.

34:24.897 --> 34:26.480
Hawkins?

34:29.884 --> 34:33.052
You're an amazing guy,
James, 100%.

34:33.146 --> 34:34.145
If there was no Conrad...

34:34.239 --> 34:36.531
Hey, hey, hey. Don't, don't.

34:37.818 --> 34:39.150
It's okay.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.227
You knew him
long before you knew me,

34:41.321 --> 34:44.498
there was already a history.
I'm aware.

34:47.661 --> 34:50.629
I don't know what to say.

34:52.816 --> 34:55.425
It was fun while it lasted.

34:55.577 --> 34:58.428
However brief.

35:01.325 --> 35:04.017
My heart's intact, okay?

35:06.997 --> 35:08.438
(pager beeps)

35:10.925 --> 35:13.001
This is him.
I... I should go.

35:13.003 --> 35:16.655
Of course.
I hope he's all right.

35:21.695 --> 35:23.703
(monitor beeping steadily)

35:26.867 --> 35:28.458
What's going on?

35:30.629 --> 35:32.754
He wanted you to be here.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.744
Unfortunately, the patient

36:12.896 --> 36:14.896
has entered the dying process.

36:14.989 --> 36:15.914
You see?

36:16.066 --> 36:19.176
Acute aortic
valve insufficiency.

36:19.252 --> 36:21.511
Widening of pulse pressure,

36:21.663 --> 36:24.514
a harbinger of doom
following a repair.

36:24.666 --> 36:29.603
It means the aorta has
torn again through the valve.

36:30.430 --> 36:32.080
Even as we speak,

36:32.098 --> 36:35.734
the patient's heart
is being surrounded by blood.

36:36.603 --> 36:39.029
Tamponade will ensue.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.682
There's nothing more
we can do for him

36:42.701 --> 36:44.618
but stay with him.

36:45.779 --> 36:47.370
Make sure he is in no pain.

36:48.189 --> 36:50.432
Do not give his care
over to nurses.

36:50.450 --> 36:53.935
Walk with him
on the final journey.

36:54.028 --> 36:56.129
Hold his hand.

36:57.290 --> 36:59.591
You see what James...

37:01.445 --> 37:03.111
...is doing?

37:03.129 --> 37:05.472
(labored breathing)

37:10.120 --> 37:13.521
This... is how it's done.

37:28.747 --> 37:32.624
Can't we place a pericardial
drain, return to the OR?

37:34.494 --> 37:36.494
His blood pressure
is too low to travel.

37:36.588 --> 37:39.256
We can open his chest
at bedside.

37:41.485 --> 37:43.218
No.

37:44.337 --> 37:47.764
I can't.... tolerate that.

37:54.273 --> 37:56.523
Goodbye...

37:58.018 --> 37:59.526
...my children.

38:26.363 --> 38:28.430
♪ ♪

39:01.340 --> 39:03.381
I am so sorry.

39:06.828 --> 39:08.470
Thanks.

39:09.589 --> 39:11.765
(inhales sharply)

39:13.668 --> 39:15.760
(chuckles softly)

39:15.912 --> 39:18.980
I think you and I
joined the same club today.

39:19.933 --> 39:22.341
(chuckles softly)

39:22.361 --> 39:25.528
Yeah.
We were too good for 'em.

39:28.425 --> 39:29.741
(sighs)

39:34.039 --> 39:36.706
Listen, if you don't
want to be alone tonight,

39:36.933 --> 39:39.784
we could grab stiff margaritas

39:39.878 --> 39:41.753
at Waylon's.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.757
You could tell me
all about Dr. Perry.

39:47.219 --> 39:49.034
Yeah.

39:49.112 --> 39:51.638
I'd like that.

39:55.802 --> 39:57.468
He was a truly great man.

39:57.621 --> 39:59.637
I know it's not the outcome
you needed this week--

39:59.789 --> 40:03.015
one of the most famous
living doctors dies at Chastain.

40:03.810 --> 40:05.309
We were honored to treat him.

40:05.404 --> 40:07.219
If he could have been saved,
you'd have done it.

40:07.239 --> 40:08.905
Is it true we're no longer

40:09.056 --> 40:10.740
a level 1 trauma hospital
after today?

40:10.892 --> 40:12.909
I never thought
I'd say it, but yes.

40:13.136 --> 40:14.911
The money is gone,
the fight is over.

40:15.138 --> 40:17.639
You know what, Kit?
Whatever happens,

40:17.732 --> 40:20.357
even if this whole place
shut down tonight,

40:20.510 --> 40:23.253
we created something great
here together.

40:23.404 --> 40:25.146
And that will live on
in everyone

40:25.239 --> 40:27.257
-who was a part of it.
-Thank you, AJ.

40:27.408 --> 40:29.909
Hey.
EMT said I needed to get this

40:29.928 --> 40:31.653
to you right away.
They went back to where

40:31.746 --> 40:34.079
they picked up your patient.
It was in a dumpster.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.673
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

40:35.750 --> 40:39.060
There's someone
I want you to say hello to.

40:40.421 --> 40:42.513
Miss Lillian,
I want you to meet someone.

40:42.666 --> 40:46.776
Hello.
I'm Kit Voss, CEO of Chastain.

40:46.928 --> 40:49.504
It's wonderful
to see you on the mend.

40:49.522 --> 40:52.740
We have something
that belongs to you.

40:55.195 --> 40:57.120
(gasps)
My purse.

40:57.305 --> 40:59.104
Oh, that's wonderful.

40:59.199 --> 41:01.774
Oh, thank heavens.

41:01.793 --> 41:04.944
Yeah. No more wallet, obviously.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.021
But tissues and...

41:07.040 --> 41:09.966
and my bus pass
and-and my lipstick.

41:10.193 --> 41:12.527
And-and Werther's!

41:12.620 --> 41:13.878
Here. Have-have some.

41:14.030 --> 41:16.030
-CONRAD: Okay.
-KIT: Oh.

41:16.049 --> 41:18.975
Gosh, I... I'm just so happy,

41:19.202 --> 41:21.035
I can't tell you. I...

41:21.054 --> 41:23.629
To think I almost died
over some worn-out old

41:23.723 --> 41:26.483
-crossbody bag.
-It's the principle
of the thing.

41:26.634 --> 41:28.209
That's right.

41:28.228 --> 41:31.738
You can't let some jerk
just take what belongs to you.

41:34.308 --> 41:37.552
I'm old,
but I fought like a tiger.

41:37.570 --> 41:41.164
When I know what's right,
I'm all in.

42:05.248 --> 42:07.598
I'm sorry. You're gonna
have to reroute the patient.

42:07.751 --> 42:10.360
Our trauma center
is closing down in five minutes.

42:10.511 --> 42:12.862
-Stroke of midnight, finished.
-What was that?

42:13.031 --> 42:15.923
-GSW.
-Oh, good luck
getting that rerouted.

42:15.942 --> 42:17.308
Nobody else
takes gunshot wounds.

42:17.460 --> 42:18.868
-I know.
-This is so wrong.

42:19.020 --> 42:21.746
May I have everyone's
attention, please.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.542
I have two announcements.

42:25.693 --> 42:28.102
One, I have meat and veggie,

42:28.195 --> 42:30.104
and for anyone who's vegan,

42:30.123 --> 42:32.382
there's salad because I cannot
condone vegan cheese.

42:32.533 --> 42:33.883
Hear, hear.

42:33.960 --> 42:36.277
Two, I have determined

42:36.296 --> 42:39.797
that Chastain Trauma
will not be closing tonight.

42:39.874 --> 42:40.965
What?

42:41.059 --> 42:43.301
I repeat, we will not
be closing our doors.

42:43.453 --> 42:46.211
Hey, just kidding.
We'll take that GSW.

42:46.231 --> 42:48.623
-What changed?
-I did.

42:48.641 --> 42:51.793
I've decided we will not
let a bully destroy us

42:51.927 --> 42:53.236
piece by piece.

42:53.463 --> 42:55.630
He cannot win.
We are going to

42:55.648 --> 42:59.391
spend every dime to deliver
top care until the money's gone.

42:59.411 --> 43:02.561
We're not gonna limp along
as a hollowed-out shell.

43:02.655 --> 43:04.414
We are going all in.

43:04.565 --> 43:06.916
-Yes! Yes!
-(all cheering)
-(laughs)

43:07.026 --> 43:08.810
-Come on, before this gets cold.
-(Hundley laughs)

43:08.903 --> 43:10.069
IRVING:
Grab a slice.
