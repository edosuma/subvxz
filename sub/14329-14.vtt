&gt;&gt; YOU'RE LISTENING TO K.R.E.P.,

11:21.747 --> 11:24.383
CREEPY MUSIC FOR THOSE CREEPY
ALLEY CLIFF-HANGERS.

11:24.450 --> 11:25.618
&gt;&gt; I HATE THIS STATION.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.455
OOPS.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.923
&gt;&gt; [screams]

11:37.029 --> 11:38.864
&gt;&gt; TIMMY, HANG ON!

11:38.931 --> 11:40.232
&gt;&gt; TO WHAT?

11:40.299 --> 11:41.267
&gt;&gt; GOOD POINT!

11:41.333 --> 11:43.803
&gt;&gt; [screams]

11:47.073 --> 11:50.342
&gt;&gt; NOW WE SHUT THAT PIE HOLE
WITH A MANHOLE.

11:51.644 --> 11:54.080
&gt;&gt; DESTROY TIMMY TURNER.

11:54.146 --> 11:56.115
&gt;&gt; ALTHOUGH I SYMPATHIZE
WITH YOUR SENTIMENTS,

11:56.182 --> 11:58.184
I CANNOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN
AT THIS TIME.

11:59.785 --> 12:01.520
HOP ON MY HOG
AND HOLD ME TIGHT.

12:03.989 --> 12:06.092
[tires squealing]

12:14.467 --> 12:15.901
&gt;&gt; THERE GOES
THAT STREET URCHIN.

12:15.968 --> 12:18.704
OOH, HE'S LIVING ON THE EDGE.

12:18.771 --> 12:21.607
&gt;&gt; HEE! NOT AS EDGY
AS WE'RE GONNA BE

12:21.674 --> 12:23.142
CRUISING IN THE M.A.R.F. MACHINE

12:23.209 --> 12:25.444
ON OUR WAY
TO THE M.A.R.F. FESTIVAL.

12:25.511 --> 12:27.313
NOW TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE
ENOUGH GOODIES

12:27.379 --> 12:29.415
TO KEEP THIS ROAD TRIP ROCKIN'.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.250
STUFF FOR MY STOMACH,
STUFF FOR MY BACK,

12:31.317 --> 12:32.852
STUFF FOR MY THROAT,

12:32.918 --> 12:35.321
AND THE NASAL SPRAY
FOR MY DEVIATED SEPTUM.

12:35.387 --> 12:36.689
[snorting]

12:36.755 --> 12:38.557
&gt;&gt; LET'S PARTY!

12:38.624 --> 12:39.692
[rock music]

12:39.758 --> 12:41.060
&gt;&gt; [both cry out]

12:41.127 --> 12:42.094
OUR BACKS!

12:42.161 --> 12:43.829
&gt;&gt; HEY, FELLOW M.A.R.F.ERS.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.831
I'M GOING TO THE MIDDLE-AGED
ROCK FESTIVAL TOO,

12:45.898 --> 12:47.066
AND I COULD USE A RIDE.

12:47.133 --> 12:49.368
&gt;&gt; LOOK, PAL.
GAS, GLASSES, OR ASPIRIN.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.836
NOBODY RIDES FOR FREE.

12:50.903 --> 12:51.804
&gt;&gt; LET'S M.A.R.F.!

12:51.871 --> 12:53.205
[all cheering]

12:56.475 --> 12:58.043
&gt;&gt; MIDDLE-AGED BLADDER.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.111
POTTY BREAK!

12:59.178 --> 13:00.613
&gt;&gt; [together] RIGHT BEHIND YOU!

13:05.317 --> 13:06.385
&gt;&gt; HE'S GAINING ON US.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.921
OH, AND BY THE WAY,
WHO IS HE?

13:08.988 --> 13:10.456
&gt;&gt; THERE WILL BE TIME
FOR EXPLANATIONS

13:10.523 --> 13:11.557
WHEN YOU ARE SAFE.

13:20.399 --> 13:22.735
[warbling noise]

13:38.517 --> 13:41.754
&gt;&gt; NOW ELIMINATE TIMMY TURNER.

13:48.093 --> 13:50.396
&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

13:50.462 --> 13:52.198
NOW HANG ON TO ME AGAIN.

13:52.264 --> 13:53.632
WE HAVE A LONG ROAD
AHEAD OF US.

13:53.699 --> 13:56.101
BUT KNOW ONE THING:
ALL THE FAIRIES ARE SAFE

13:56.168 --> 13:58.103
AND HIDDEN WHERE THE ENEMY
CANNOT FIND THEM.

13:58.170 --> 14:02.808
[upbeat banjo music]

14:09.915 --> 14:11.450
&gt;&gt; AH!
WHERE ARE WE?

14:11.517 --> 14:12.785
LAST THING I REMEMBER

14:12.851 --> 14:15.221
IS JORGEN PULLING US OUT
OF TIMMY'S TRILOGY WISH.

14:15.287 --> 14:16.522
&gt;&gt; AND THE LAST THING
I REMEMBER

14:16.589 --> 14:18.057
IS YOU SAYING THE LAST THING
YOU REMEMBER

14:18.123 --> 14:19.925
IS JORGEN PULLING US OUT
OF TIMMY'S TRILOGY WISH.

14:19.992 --> 14:21.227
&gt;&gt; POOF!

14:21.293 --> 14:23.762
&gt;&gt; OH!
WE'RE IN A GUMBALL MACHINE.

14:23.829 --> 14:25.831
&gt;&gt; I HOPE WE'RE SUGARLESS.

14:25.898 --> 14:28.234
&gt;&gt; EVERY FAIRY IN FAIRYWORLD
MUST BE IN HERE.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.603
&gt;&gt; I'M MORE OF A FIREBALL
THAN A GUMBALL.

14:30.669 --> 14:32.838
AT LEAST WE'RE NOT
AT THE BOTTOM, LIKE BINKY.

14:32.905 --> 14:34.807
&gt;&gt; HI, GUYS.

14:34.873 --> 14:37.076
&gt;&gt; WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHY
JORGEN PUT US IN HERE,

14:37.142 --> 14:38.611
BUT WE'RE GETTING OUT.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.546
OH, NO, OUR WANDS ARE GONE.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.615
&gt;&gt; AND OUR HANDS ARE GONE!

14:42.681 --> 14:44.149
&gt;&gt; BUT AT LEAST WE'RE SAFE.

14:44.216 --> 14:47.586
[ominous music]

14:49.688 --> 14:50.589
&gt;&gt; NOT SAFE!

14:52.524 --> 14:54.560
&gt;&gt; [screams]

14:54.627 --> 14:57.129
&gt;&gt; [together] OH, NO!
HE'S GOT BINKY!

14:57.196 --> 14:59.665
&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE
A GUMBALLLLLLLLL!

14:59.732 --> 15:01.300
[screaming]

15:01.367 --> 15:03.235
&gt;&gt; [together] AH, THE HORROR!

15:04.637 --> 15:07.206
AH, THE QUARTERS!

15:07.273 --> 15:09.141
&gt;&gt; DON'T LET GO.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.977
[grunting]

15:12.044 --> 15:14.546
[bird shrieking]

15:16.048 --> 15:18.617
YOU COULD HAVE LET GO THAT TIME.

15:18.684 --> 15:22.621
[grunting]

15:22.688 --> 15:24.890
&gt;&gt; WE'RE BACK HERE AGAIN?

15:24.957 --> 15:27.126
&gt;&gt; OH, YOU'VE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

15:27.192 --> 15:28.694
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR,
ANYWAY?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.296
&gt;&gt; THE CAVE OF DESTINY.

15:30.362 --> 15:32.264
IT IS WHERE ALL YOUR QUESTIONS
WILL BE ANSWERED.

15:32.331 --> 15:33.932
&gt;&gt; YOU MEAN LIKE THAT CAVE
UP THERE?

15:35.668 --> 15:37.970
&gt;&gt; MAN, WHY CAN I NEVER FIND
THAT PLACE?

15:38.037 --> 15:40.973
[rat squeaking
and bat chirping]

15:41.040 --> 15:42.975
&gt;&gt; THE CAVE OF DESTINY
IS CREEPY.

15:43.042 --> 15:44.810
&gt;&gt; OH, THESE ARE JUST FROM

15:44.877 --> 15:47.313
LAST YEAR'S HALLOWEEN PARTY...
I THINK.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.548
WE ALSO RENT OUT THE CAVE
FOR WEDDINGS AND BAR MITZVAHS.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.649
&gt;&gt; OKAY, WHERE WAS I?

15:50.716 --> 15:52.785
OH, YEAH.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:52.851 --> 15:54.420
&gt;&gt; MAYBE THESE PRETTY PICTURES
WILL HELP.

15:54.486 --> 15:56.322
OR, AS WE CALL THEM
IN FAIRYWORLD...

15:56.388 --> 15:58.590
[in booming voice]
THE CAVE PROPHESY!

15:58.657 --> 15:59.925
&gt;&gt; THE CAVE PROPHESY?

15:59.992 --> 16:01.226
&gt;&gt; NO, YOU'RE NOT SAYING IT
RIGHT.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.494
GO WITH THE ECHO.

16:02.561 --> 16:05.531
[in booming voice]
THE CAVE PROPHESY!

16:05.597 --> 16:06.999
IN ANCIENT FAIRY TIMES,

16:07.066 --> 16:09.535
A FAIRY'S MAIN JOB
WAS TO FIGHT, NOT FROLIC.

16:09.601 --> 16:11.236
THEY CONSTANTLY BATTLED
A MYSTERIOUS ENEMY

16:11.303 --> 16:13.005
CALLED THE DARKNESS...

16:16.542 --> 16:20.112
AND ITS AGENTS OF DESTRUCTION,
ELIMINATORS.

16:21.613 --> 16:23.015
&gt;&gt; [together] HUH!

16:31.990 --> 16:34.626
&gt;&gt; AND THE FAIRY WARRIORS
WERE VICTORIOUS

16:34.693 --> 16:36.995
ONLY WHEN THEY COMBINED
ALL OF THEIR WAND POWERS

16:37.062 --> 16:41.834
AND NEUTRALIZED THE DARKNESS
WITH ITS NATURAL ENEMY, LIGHT.

16:44.436 --> 16:47.906
[cheering]

16:47.973 --> 16:50.576
BUT OUR ANCIENT ANCESTORS FEARED

16:50.642 --> 16:53.312
THAT THIS MYSTERIOUS FOE
WOULD COME BACK.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.852
SO THEY SENT MILLIONS
OF OUR STRONGEST SOLDIERS

16:59.918 --> 17:02.855
INTO THE VOID OF SPACE
TO ILLUMINATE IT...

17:07.893 --> 17:10.596
SO THAT SHOULD THE DARKNESS
EVER RETURN,

17:10.662 --> 17:12.664
WE WILL HAVE A SHIELD
OF PROTECTION

17:12.731 --> 17:15.401
NOT UNLIKE TODAY'S
UNDERARM DEODORANTS.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.903
&gt;&gt; AMAZING!

17:17.970 --> 17:19.003
DO YOU HAVE ANY POPCORN?

17:19.070 --> 17:20.406
&gt;&gt; SMALL, MEDIUM, OR LARGE?

17:20.472 --> 17:21.773
&gt;&gt; SURPRISE ME.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.608
SO THE STARS IN SPACE
ARE REALLY FAIRY WARRIORS

17:23.675 --> 17:25.210
WATCHING OUT FOR THE DARKNESS?

17:25.277 --> 17:27.378
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY. THEY ARE
OUR FIRST WARNING SYSTEM.

17:27.445 --> 17:28.680
AND LAST NIGHT,

17:28.747 --> 17:30.849
OUR DEEPEST OUTPOST,
THE BIG DIPPER BRIGADE,

17:30.916 --> 17:32.151
JUST DISAPPEARED.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.352
&gt;&gt; THE BIG DIPPER.

17:33.419 --> 17:35.521
THAT'S WHY CROCKER SAID
IT DIDN'T EXIST!

17:35.587 --> 17:38.056
&gt;&gt; YES, I HAD TO WIPE AWAY
ALL MEMORY OF ITS EXISTENCE

17:38.123 --> 17:39.391
SO PEOPLE WOULDN'T FREAK OUT.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.860
I ALSO WIPED AWAY
ANY MEMORY OF YOU

17:41.927 --> 17:43.796
SO THAT NO ONE WOULD SAY
YOUR NAME

17:43.862 --> 17:45.297
AND GIVE AWAY YOUR LOCATION.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.800
&gt;&gt; SO THIS IS GREAT,
BUT HOW DOES IT AFFECT ME?

17:47.866 --> 17:50.569
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT FINISHED.

17:50.636 --> 17:53.806
OUR ANCESTORS THEN HID
AN ALL-POWERFUL MAGIC WAND

17:53.872 --> 17:56.375
THAT COULD DESTROY THE DARKNESS,
SHOULD IT EVER RETURN.

17:56.442 --> 17:58.444
AND TO PROTECT THIS WHITE WAND

17:58.510 --> 18:00.345
FROM FALLING
INTO THE WRONG HANDS,

18:00.412 --> 18:02.247
THEY DECIDED
THAT ONLY A CHOSEN ONE

18:02.314 --> 18:04.750
COULD POSSESS IT
AND UNLOCK ITS TRUE POWERS.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.752
&gt;&gt; COOL.
WHERE IS IT?

18:06.819 --> 18:08.654
&gt;&gt; NO ONE KNOWS,
BUT IT'S SAID

18:08.720 --> 18:11.056
THAT THIS CRYPTIC MESSAGE
REVEALS ITS LOCATION.

18:11.123 --> 18:14.026
SO FAR, NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE
TO SOLVE THIS ANCIENT RIDDLE.

18:17.763 --> 18:18.730
&gt;&gt; WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

18:18.797 --> 18:20.265
&gt;&gt; YOU TELL ME,

18:20.332 --> 18:23.202
BECAUSE THE CHOSEN ONE IS YOU,
TIMMY TURNER!

18:23.268 --> 18:25.237
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

18:25.304 --> 18:26.738
&gt;&gt; YES, CHECK IT OUT.

18:26.805 --> 18:29.241
PINK HAT, BIG TEETH,
INITIALS T.T.

18:29.308 --> 18:30.876
AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS IT.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.412
&gt;&gt; THE ELIMINATORS WERE HERE?

18:33.479 --> 18:34.980
THEY KNOW I'M THE CHOSEN ONE?

18:35.047 --> 18:36.915
AND YOU JUST SAID MY NAME
OUT LOUD?

18:36.982 --> 18:38.617
&gt;&gt; AND IT ECHOED A BIT TOO,
DIDN'T IT?

18:40.219 --> 18:41.920
&gt;&gt; ELIMINATE TIMMY TURNER.

18:41.987 --> 18:43.822
&gt;&gt; MAN, THAT THING LOOKS
TERRIFYING!

18:46.925 --> 18:48.260
GET US OUT OF HERE!

18:50.329 --> 18:51.663
&gt;&gt; [whistles]

19:08.313 --> 19:09.281
&gt;&gt; [Timmy yells]

19:09.348 --> 19:10.883
WE'RE HEADING FOR THE WALL!

19:10.949 --> 19:12.417
&gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.486
WE WILL VANISH BEFORE WE--

19:23.262 --> 19:26.098
[high-pitched, rapid beeping]

19:28.967 --> 19:31.603
&gt;&gt; LISTEN, AS THE CHOSEN ONE,
I CHOOSE TO BE

19:31.670 --> 19:33.071
NOT THE CHOSEN ONE!

19:33.138 --> 19:34.506
I'VE NEVER BEEN CHOSEN
FOR ANYTHING:

19:34.573 --> 19:35.908
NOT KICKBALL,
NOT LAB PARTNER.

19:35.974 --> 19:37.509
WHY?
BECAUSE I'M A BAD CHOICE!

19:37.576 --> 19:39.811
&gt;&gt; THE CAVE PROPHESY
DOES NOT LIE.

19:39.878 --> 19:41.046
DON'T WORRY;
I HAVE A PLAN.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.614
&gt;&gt; AH, THANK GOODNESS.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.383
&gt;&gt; IF IT'S YOU THEY WANT,
IT'S YOU THEY'LL GET.

19:44.449 --> 19:45.584
&gt;&gt; I HATE THAT PLAN!

19:47.586 --> 19:48.687
PLAN'S GETTING BETTER.

19:48.754 --> 19:50.389
&gt;&gt; GOOD LUCK, TIMMY TURNER.

19:50.455 --> 19:53.792
YOU WERE A PAIN IN MY BUTT,
BUT...

19:53.859 --> 19:54.793
WELL, THAT'S ALL I GOT.

19:54.860 --> 19:55.794
GOOD LUCK.

19:55.861 --> 19:56.795
&gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

19:56.862 --> 19:58.263
&gt;&gt; FOR YOU TO GO ON,

19:58.330 --> 20:00.365
THE DARKNESS MUST BELIEVE
YOU HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

20:00.432 --> 20:02.768
REMEMBER, THE WAND IS HIDDEN
IN A ROCK

20:02.834 --> 20:04.136
SEALED WITH A KISS.

20:04.202 --> 20:07.039
HELLO!
I AM TIMMY TURNER.

20:07.105 --> 20:08.740
LOOK HOW STUPID I AM.

20:08.807 --> 20:09.975
[babbling]

20:13.445 --> 20:15.314
[Jorgen yelling]

20:18.383 --> 20:20.886
&gt;&gt; FINALLY,
WE HAVE THE CHOSEN ONE.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.087
&gt;&gt; CAN WE STAY?

20:22.154 --> 20:24.056
WE SAW SOME COOL SHOPS
ON MAIN STREET.

20:24.122 --> 20:26.191
&gt;&gt; YEAH, NO ONE SAID
YOU WERE THE BOSS OF US, AND--

20:29.494 --> 20:31.363
&gt;&gt; HELLO?
JORGEN?

20:31.430 --> 20:34.232
HELLO?
JORGEN? ANYBODY?

20:34.299 --> 20:35.934
I CAN'T STOP THE DARKNESS
BY MYSELF.

20:36.001 --> 20:37.169
HOW DO I FIND THE WAND?

20:37.235 --> 20:38.437
HOW DO I GET BACK TO EARTH?

20:38.503 --> 20:41.273
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

20:41.340 --> 20:42.574
WAIT A MINUTE.

20:42.641 --> 20:43.942
ALL THOSE STARS
ARE FAIRY WARRIORS

20:44.009 --> 20:45.377
READY TO STOP THE DARKNESS.

20:45.444 --> 20:47.546
YES!
I'M NOT ALONE!

20:49.681 --> 20:51.583
[screams]

21:01.727 --> 21:03.095
[telephone rings]

21:03.161 --> 21:05.297
&gt;&gt; MILITARY EXTRATERRESTRIAL
RESEARCH FACILITY.

21:05.364 --> 21:07.099
UH-HUH. YEAH. I SEE.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.434
[beeping]

21:09.501 --> 21:11.136
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S WITH
THE M.E.R.F. ALARMS?

21:11.203 --> 21:12.904
&gt;&gt; LOOK, IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING,

21:12.971 --> 21:14.973
BUT IT SEEMS THAT EVERY STAR
IN THE SKY

21:15.040 --> 21:16.742
HAS COMPLETELY VANISHED.

21:16.808 --> 21:19.311
&gt;&gt; EH, YOU'RE RIGHT;
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.

21:19.378 --> 21:21.480
EVERY STAR IN THE SKY
HAS VANISHED?

21:21.546 --> 21:23.849
&gt;&gt; SHOULD WE PUT OUT
AN EMERGENCY BROADCAST

21:23.915 --> 21:25.717
LETTING THE POPULATION
OF EARTH KNOW

21:25.784 --> 21:27.552
