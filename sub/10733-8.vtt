Ben Tennyson!

00:48.064 --> 00:50.026
I see him. Thanks, Chief.

00:50.095 --> 00:51.659
I'm not the Chief.

00:57.260 --> 00:59.558
We will take it from here.

00:59.594 --> 01:04.025
Careful. She stole
some kind of fusion thing.

01:04.093 --> 01:08.359
I am a Plumber, officer.
I am always careful.

01:28.965 --> 01:32.398
At the end of your rope, huh?

Uh... shoo.

02:30.400 --> 02:35.804
You might have the power,
Ben Tennyson, but I got the reach!

02:41.478 --> 02:43.245
Do not touch it!

02:49.219 --> 02:53.455
It's been an honor, Ben,
but I don't think that form suits you.

02:53.524 --> 02:56.458
Bye-bye!

03:02.799 --> 03:06.800
Okay. So, the girl took the
fusion device where?

03:12.641 --> 03:14.709
Are you going to stay like that?

03:14.744 --> 03:16.910
Just till the Omnitrix times out.

03:16.946 --> 03:21.715
How long does that take?
- Uh, 15 minutes or so.

03:21.751 --> 03:22.916
Guess that's it.

03:22.985 --> 03:26.620
I think our thief appreciate
this Ben Tennyson a little more.

03:26.655 --> 03:27.387
Huh?

03:27.456 --> 03:30.825
She did express interest
in some other form of yours.

03:30.893 --> 03:32.994
Oh.
She must have meant Ditto.

03:33.029 --> 03:35.463
According to the fan sites,
that's my cutest alien.

03:35.498 --> 03:37.565
That is not
at all what she meant.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.033
Ha! Right!

03:39.102 --> 03:41.102
'Cause you know
everything about girls.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.576
We have something.

04:06.698 --> 04:08.397
Bet it's that.

04:10.234 --> 04:14.303
An old thermo-electric
generator. Space junk.

04:14.338 --> 04:18.572
Not junk. A bargain!
12 taydens.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.048
It's even hotter down
here than it is up there!

04:27.117 --> 04:29.317
Perhaps I can
recalibrate ...

04:29.386 --> 04:32.421
Uh, Rook?
Don't bother.

04:42.466 --> 04:44.166
<i>Hold it!</i>

04:44.202 --> 04:46.869
You turned human.
- I do that.

04:46.938 --> 04:49.172
Hand over the fusion
engine, please.

04:49.241 --> 04:51.307
What if I told you I couldn't?

04:51.343 --> 04:54.344
It's not a matter of "could."
Two of us, one of you.

04:54.413 --> 04:58.584
You sure you won't
just trust me on this? No?

05:30.583 --> 05:32.151
Got ya!

05:33.020 --> 05:38.991
You sure?

05:42.029 --> 05:43.362
I'm pretty sure.

05:43.431 --> 05:45.198
<i>Get off her!</i>

05:48.836 --> 05:49.902
Off!

05:53.675 --> 05:58.111
Give us the fusion engine.
- Who are you?

05:58.180 --> 06:02.115
We're the Kraaho.
I'm Seebik.

06:02.183 --> 06:04.550
Uh, can we do this quickly, Seebik?

06:04.585 --> 06:06.185
I can see my breath!

06:06.220 --> 06:08.921
You're cold?
What's your problem?

06:08.989 --> 06:14.393
You're the one with
the problem. The fusion engine.

06:14.461 --> 06:19.297
You are not getting it.
- Not without a fight.

06:25.271 --> 06:29.208
Is everyone around here
made of rubber?

06:29.277 --> 06:31.377
Only the winners.

06:35.013 --> 06:38.782
I'm warning you...
- Yes?

06:44.056 --> 06:44.955
I got nothing.

06:44.990 --> 06:47.125
Let's do
this again sometime ...

06:47.425 --> 06:52.129
this or anything else, I guess.
- Huh?

06:52.198 --> 06:55.866
C-c-c-can we get going, Seebik?
I'm f-freezing!

06:55.902 --> 06:59.704
Ester, stop
talking to that cold-cut.

07:03.442 --> 07:06.311
These are Tungsten-based
life forms, no doubt.

07:06.346 --> 07:07.946
Uh-huh. Totally.

07:07.981 --> 07:12.316
S-Seebik, two more
minutes, and I'm an ice sculpture.

07:12.385 --> 07:17.954
All right, Lackno.
But first... finish him off.

07:17.990 --> 07:20.957
Seebik, that's Ben Tennyson!

07:21.026 --> 07:23.426
Don't forget Rook!
Better "off" him, too.

07:23.495 --> 07:28.063
I'd totally let you guys go,
but this guy never gives up.

07:28.098 --> 07:32.501
Back to the hot spot!
- But you never said you...

07:32.536 --> 07:34.436
This isn't the Kraaho way.

07:34.471 --> 07:37.939
The Kraaho way
is what I say it is!

07:37.975 --> 07:39.807
Go ... now!

07:57.660 --> 08:02.163
They seem to want to "off" us
with some sort of ritualized "offing."

08:02.199 --> 08:04.433
Thank you,
tribal culture channel.

08:08.039 --> 08:11.173
Okay, then. Take off!

08:14.045 --> 08:19.449
First, I make you weightless,
and then...

08:19.518 --> 08:21.184
Then I time out.

08:21.253 --> 08:24.555
I thought you said 15 minutes.
- Give or take.

08:35.232 --> 08:38.102
Sorry.
I can't let you do this.

08:38.169 --> 08:40.736
<i>I'm f-f-freezing!</i>

08:40.773 --> 08:42.272
<i>- I can't see!
- Over there!</i>

08:49.647 --> 08:54.083
Come on!

09:01.858 --> 09:05.027
Hurry!
- Wait. I can't run away.

09:05.096 --> 09:08.830
It doesn't matter if those guys
are made of Tungsten or tuna fish.

09:08.899 --> 09:10.131
I got to stop them.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.468
They have what they want.
They won't be any more trouble.

09:13.503 --> 09:17.672
Everything about this is trouble.
- Yeah, including yo... unh!

09:23.845 --> 09:27.381
The Kraaho can't
follow us up here. Too cold.

09:27.417 --> 09:31.186
Sure, 'cause it's only
100 degrees... in the shade.

09:31.221 --> 09:36.024
The Kraaho need extreme
heat, yet you seem fine without it.

09:36.059 --> 09:39.694
I'm only half-Kraaho.
To me, it's just nippy out.

09:39.763 --> 09:43.231
And the fusion engine?
- They needed that to keep warm.

09:43.266 --> 09:47.334
And now they have what
they need, so... problem solved?

09:47.403 --> 09:49.770
Exactly.
Ben gets it.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.873
You're overthinking everything.
- I wouldn't say ...

09:52.942 --> 09:54.775
<i>- It's Ester!
- Ester!</i>

09:56.479 --> 09:57.478
Friends of mine.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.146
<i>Come play with us!</i>

09:59.182 --> 10:03.785
<i>- Yeah!
- Come on, you guys!</i>

10:04.854 --> 10:07.955
We were chasing a
thief, and there she is!

10:07.991 --> 10:12.527
Yeah, and she saved us, dude.
Loosen up!

10:13.630 --> 10:16.964
"Problem solved, dude!
She saved us, dude!

10:17.000 --> 10:19.066
Loosen yourself, dude!"

10:22.905 --> 10:24.438
Want to play with us?

10:24.474 --> 10:27.809
He's playing.
Come on, player.

10:28.545 --> 10:31.813
<i>Car!</i>

10:31.881 --> 10:34.148
Here we go!
- Let's do this!

10:37.387 --> 10:39.353
Hey!

10:48.397 --> 10:50.364
Car!

10:59.942 --> 11:04.445
We can go easy if you want.
- Go easy?

11:06.883 --> 11:09.283
It's on like computron!

11:17.294 --> 11:20.061
<i>- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!</i>

11:25.904 --> 11:26.903
Who wants to cool off?

11:37.548 --> 11:40.817
Hey, Ester...

11:40.853 --> 11:43.153
No! No!

11:49.528 --> 11:55.532
<i>Android ella, dressed in yella,
went topside to kiss a fella!</i>

12:07.377 --> 12:08.910
She likes you, Ben, dude.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.512
Everyone likes me.
I'm the hero.

12:11.548 --> 12:14.148
Yes, but she is not innocent.

12:14.183 --> 12:16.804
The party is over.
You must tell her.

12:16.805 --> 12:22.456
Be the hero, Ben...
before I am forced to poop this party.

12:34.636 --> 12:38.205
It's ready.
- Fire the laser!

12:42.144 --> 12:44.178
How long will this take?

12:44.213 --> 12:47.081
I've been cold so long,
I've got frostbite on my...

12:47.117 --> 12:51.386
Lackno! Enough with
the "how cold is it" jokes!

12:51.421 --> 12:52.487
...on my frostbite.

12:53.256 --> 12:56.024
Seebik!
The laser struck magma!

12:56.092 --> 12:59.661
Here we go!
Valves open! Pumps on!

13:06.837 --> 13:09.305
Ahh. Finally!

13:09.373 --> 13:14.109
Yeah.
Yeah, I was so cold that ...

13:15.446 --> 13:17.378
Never mind.

13:17.414 --> 13:22.784
Now let's clear some room for ...
what do they call it topside?

13:22.852 --> 13:25.052
Bellwood.

13:28.623 --> 13:34.528
Make way for New Bellwood.

14:21.217 --> 14:22.950
I swear I didn't know!

14:23.019 --> 14:26.520
That the Kraaho would
use the fusion engine to do this?

14:26.589 --> 14:29.456
This is their work, isn't it?

14:30.092 --> 14:33.326
We're past the blame stage.
It's hero time!

14:46.074 --> 14:49.443
Arctiguana?
Cool!

15:00.155 --> 15:03.156
Ester! You're okay!
- For now.

15:03.225 --> 15:06.259
<i>Look!
The lava is still coming.</i>

15:06.294 --> 15:09.796
<i>What will happen when it
flows down into undertown?</i>

15:10.865 --> 15:11.731
My parents!

15:11.799 --> 15:14.900
Miss, we need
that fusion engine back.

15:14.969 --> 15:16.969
The Kraaho are using you.

15:17.004 --> 15:19.705
They said they wanted
to make it warmer down there.

15:19.773 --> 15:20.906
Down where?

15:20.975 --> 15:24.276
That place they told you to
go to, right ... the hot spot?

15:24.311 --> 15:27.012
You're asking
me to betray my people.

15:27.081 --> 15:30.048
Asking?
I am begging you.

15:35.156 --> 15:37.156
It's a miracle, Seebik!

15:37.191 --> 15:40.092
You turned this frozen
wasteland into an oasis!

15:40.128 --> 15:45.799
As soon as New Bellwood's
warm and the stragglers dealt with...

15:45.834 --> 15:49.536
how does the name
"New Earth" strike you?

15:50.739 --> 15:52.415
<i>Seebik!</i>

15:55.404 --> 15:57.444
You lied to me!

15:57.480 --> 15:59.713
How long can
we stay in this cavern?

15:59.749 --> 16:02.183
A generation?
Two, maybe?

16:02.251 --> 16:04.285
We need a world, Ester.

16:04.320 --> 16:08.556
This world doesn't
belong to you. You can't roast it!

16:08.591 --> 16:13.027
It's not up for debate!
My word is law!

16:19.902 --> 16:25.572
Create a distraction.
I'll get the fusion device.

16:29.277 --> 16:33.213
<i>Hey! Hey!
Eyes on me!</i>

16:33.281 --> 16:35.916
Today we will learn an Earth
game called "tag."

16:41.024 --> 16:42.757
You are it!

16:45.896 --> 16:49.764
I'm a way better at distractions.

16:54.036 --> 16:59.974
You brought him here?
Your father would be ashamed of you!

17:17.960 --> 17:20.162
Um...
very good!

17:20.230 --> 17:23.298
Now, who wants to learn the
electric slide?

18:06.845 --> 18:10.780
Rook!

18:22.694 --> 18:24.394
Hurry, Ben!

18:35.676 --> 18:40.145
Keep that cold-cut
away from the engine!

18:40.180 --> 18:43.214
Get off me!

18:46.619 --> 18:51.054
<i>No! Please, whatever you
do, keep the suit closed!</i>

18:51.123 --> 18:54.958
Don't open me up!
That will end NRG!

19:01.365 --> 19:02.799
Suckers!

19:12.444 --> 19:18.350
Warriors,
don't let him... do that.

19:24.924 --> 19:28.626
That is good fusion engine.

19:44.477 --> 19:47.611
Well, you've won.
Happy?

19:47.647 --> 19:52.082
You haven't exactly lost.
We'll do just fine here in the hot spot.

19:52.117 --> 19:54.417
It is practically
another part of undertown.

19:54.453 --> 19:56.419
You even have your own private
hot springs.

19:56.454 --> 20:00.890
Coexistence, living
next to a city of cold-cuts ...

20:00.925 --> 20:03.626
that's not the Kraaho way.

20:03.662 --> 20:08.064
No, Seebik, it's not your way.
I see that now.

20:08.100 --> 20:10.066
But it was my father's way.

20:10.102 --> 20:12.902
Yeah!
Wait, who was your father?

20:12.971 --> 20:18.743
He was the leader
before Seebik.

20:18.778 --> 20:20.010
What are you doing?

20:20.079 --> 20:24.482
Anything she wants.
She's defeated me.

20:24.517 --> 20:25.549
And?

20:25.618 --> 20:30.387
And the Kraaho way is
whatever you say it is.

20:30.456 --> 20:34.191
Coexistence.
- You'd allow it?

20:34.226 --> 20:39.395
As long as you don't step
out of line. If you do, well...

20:39.431 --> 20:43.733
<i>As leader of the
Kraaho, I swear this day </i>

20:43.801 --> 20:48.671
that I will always be a good
neighbor to you, Ben Tennyson.

20:48.707 --> 20:51.641
Uh, yeah.
Well, easy, now.

20:51.676 --> 20:57.112
Rook has to go patrol his...
right, Rook?

20:57.181 --> 20:58.832
Water.

21:00.833 --> 21:02.484
Lemonade?

21:11.261 --> 21:12.594
Thank you.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.329
<i>Hey, it's Ester's boyfriend!</i>

21:14.398 --> 21:16.598
Hey, Ester's boyfriend!
- Hi, Ester's boyfriend!

21:16.667 --> 21:18.866
<i>Ester has a boyfriend!</i>

21:18.935 --> 21:21.136
Where's Ester?
- Still at large.

21:21.204 --> 21:25.307
Not her fault the fusion
engine was never recovered.

21:25.342 --> 21:30.012
She's not my girlfriend!
We're just... friends. Just...

21:30.047 --> 21:33.315
Hey, wait a second.
Do you think I have a shot with her?

21:33.384 --> 21:35.350
What?
