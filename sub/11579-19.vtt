00:01.434 --> 00:03.163
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.235 --> 00:06.899
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:07.007 --> 00:08.064
In New York City,

00:08.141 --> 00:11.133
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.211 --> 00:14.703
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.781 --> 00:16.544
These are their stories,

00:17.484 --> 00:20.647
You just send 1 00 bucks
to the guy at the top,
recruit 10 more guys,

00:20.720 --> 00:22.244
couple of weeks
you got $10,000.

00:22.322 --> 00:23.584
Scam, Gordy.

00:23.656 --> 00:26.750
It's not. My cousin done it.
Made a mint.

00:26.826 --> 00:28.191
Watch the glass.

00:28.261 --> 00:30.252
It's a pyramid scheme.
Guys at the top get rich.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.229
Schmucks below them
don't see a dime.

00:32.298 --> 00:33.663
Who's your cousin,
Kenneth Lay?

00:33.733 --> 00:35.564
No, Joe Stiltson.

00:35.835 --> 00:38.804
Damn it. Watch out.
There's oil or something.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.698
Are you coming?
This ain't getting
any Iighter.

00:42.776 --> 00:43.765
It's illegal, Gordy.

00:43.843 --> 00:45.640
You get people to invest,
you...

00:46.379 --> 00:47.812
Holy hell.

00:52.919 --> 00:54.079
PARAMEDIC:
Victim's in her teens,

00:54.154 --> 00:55.553
You get a name?
No.

00:55.622 --> 00:58.318
Attacker's name?
Non-responsive
the whole ride over.

00:58.391 --> 00:59.653
She say anything
at the scene?

00:59.726 --> 01:01.819
Just, "He raped me."
Then she was out again.

01:01.895 --> 01:02.953
In Trauma 4.

01:04.129 --> 01:06.462
There.
DOCTOR:
Pupils fixed and dilated.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.128
Fresh blood in the ear canal.

01:08.201 --> 01:10.294
She's got a skull fracture
and multiple scalp Iacs.

01:10.370 --> 01:11.598
Regular rate and rhythm.

01:11.671 --> 01:15.107
She's a rape victim.
We have to preserve
hair and fiber evidence.

01:15.175 --> 01:18.167
BP is 140 over 90.
DOCTOR: Lung sounds
clear bilaterally.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.973
Abdomen's rigid.
Pressure's falling.

01:20.046 --> 01:21.980
Start a unit of O-neg
and get her to the OR.

01:22.048 --> 01:23.140
She's bleeding
into her belly.

01:23.216 --> 01:24.877
Wait, wait, wait.
Did anybody start
a rape kit?

01:24.951 --> 01:26.646
NURSE: Come on, Iet's go.
Got to move.

01:26.719 --> 01:27.845
We're Iosing her. Get that!

01:27.921 --> 01:28.945
Hold the door!

01:29.022 --> 01:30.649
DOCTOR: Come on, guys.
Let's go.
Move it, move it, move it.

01:30.723 --> 01:31.781
Any signs of fluids?

01:31.858 --> 01:34.418
BP's 80 palp.
Still tachy at 120.

01:34.494 --> 01:36.485
PIease, you're taking
my DNA evidence.

01:36.563 --> 01:38.690
Just one swab?
And an oral?

01:38.765 --> 01:42.132
DOCTOR: Coming through.
There's a stain on her thigh.

01:42.202 --> 01:43.464
If you could
just give me that?
NURSE: Here.

01:43.536 --> 01:46.130
DOCTOR: Coming through.
Let's go. Let's go!

01:47.273 --> 01:49.764
This area is sterile.
You're not going to
contaminate my OR.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.539
If I could just get
a fingernail scraping...
You're done.

01:58.418 --> 02:00.283
Hopefully we've got DNA
in here.

02:00.353 --> 02:02.844
So get it straight over
to the ME's office.
Right.

02:02.922 --> 02:04.981
Then voucher the clothes
and drop them
at the police Iab.

02:05.058 --> 02:07.117
The ME first, Iab second.
You got it?

02:07.193 --> 02:09.684
CIothes. Where are
the clothes? Here we go.

02:11.431 --> 02:12.762
They didn't do
a full rape kit.

02:12.832 --> 02:14.527
Only had time between
the ER and the OR,

02:14.601 --> 02:16.535
and then, you know,
they wash everything
away with betadyne, so...

02:16.603 --> 02:17.695
She didn't make it.
Huh?

02:17.770 --> 02:20.238
Our victim.
She died on the table.

02:21.774 --> 02:23.765
I got in the way.
They were trying
to save her Iife

02:23.843 --> 02:25.572
and I was trying
to make a collar.
I got in the way.

02:25.645 --> 02:28.273
No. The doctor said
there was massive
internal bleeding.

02:28.348 --> 02:30.873
She blew a clot.
There's nothing
anyone could have done.

02:30.950 --> 02:31.939
Nothing.

02:32.919 --> 02:36.946
Okay.
So Iet's canvass
the neighborhood.

02:37.524 --> 02:39.958
Get a name for
the death certificate.
Emily Porter.

02:40.026 --> 02:44.190
Paramedics cut off
her jacket in the bus,
found this in her pocket.

02:44.731 --> 02:46.961
Percocet. You got an address?

02:47.033 --> 02:48.295
From the pharmacy.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.598
WOMAN ON PA: Dr, Russ,
report to the main room
immediately,

02:50.670 --> 02:52.797
Let's go notify
the parents.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.542
Hi. Is your mom or dad home?

03:00.613 --> 03:02.046
Mom, door!

03:03.283 --> 03:05.649
Are you here
to pay condolences?

03:06.519 --> 03:09.147
Oh. My grandma died
Iast night.

03:12.592 --> 03:13.650
Yes?

03:14.561 --> 03:15.755
Mrs. Porter?

03:15.828 --> 03:16.886
Yes.

03:16.963 --> 03:18.794
Are you the mother
of Emily Porter?

03:19.465 --> 03:21.865
No. I'm Emily Porter.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:14.187 --> 04:15.415
I've never seen her before.

04:15.488 --> 04:17.512
Your drugs were
found on her.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.885
Drugs? I'm not taking any...

04:22.729 --> 04:24.390
I had a root canal
two weeks ago,

04:24.464 --> 04:25.453
but they made me Ioopy.

04:25.531 --> 04:28.591
Do you have any idea
how they Ieft the premises?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.334
Heather?

04:38.144 --> 04:39.509
Did the pills kill her?

04:39.579 --> 04:41.774
No, we just need
to know who she is.

04:41.981 --> 04:43.642
I don't know her.
I swear.

04:43.716 --> 04:45.115
But you did give her
the pills?

04:45.184 --> 04:46.208
No!

04:47.620 --> 04:48.712
There's this guy.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.951
Everyone at
the skateboard park
talks about him.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.356
He'II buy anything
you give him.

04:53.426 --> 04:55.189
STABLER: What's his name?

04:56.162 --> 04:57.789
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)

05:01.701 --> 05:02.827
Doc.

05:05.271 --> 05:06.761
Nice office.
You got an appointment?

05:06.839 --> 05:08.067
Man, I don't take walk-ins.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.041
Looking for some Vicodin.

05:10.109 --> 05:12.771
Well, you need
a prescription for that.
You got a prescription?

05:12.845 --> 05:15.439
Normally I would have one,
but today I'm working
on my own.

05:15.515 --> 05:17.574
My partner, he has some
kind of dignitary duty.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.982
They carting his ass around
in a Iimo. You believe that?

05:20.053 --> 05:21.281
What the hell
you talking about, man?

05:21.354 --> 05:23.822
Sorry. I just needed
to vent.

05:23.890 --> 05:26.950
Bring your ass here.
Who is she?

05:27.026 --> 05:28.425
I don't know.
Okay.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.428
I'm going in.
Going to charge you
with everything I find.

05:30.496 --> 05:31.929
Come on. No.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.330
Want me to stop going
through your pockets?
You tell me who she is.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.061
Okay, okay. Look,
I don't know her name,

05:36.135 --> 05:38.831
but she came in, Iike,
10:00 this morning,
bought some happy pills.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.999
You're a regular
one-stop shop here.
What do you got, fake ID?

05:42.075 --> 05:44.168
Ready to make a deal
or you want me to go
into pocket number three?

05:44.243 --> 05:45.335
There's nothing else to tell.

05:45.411 --> 05:48.005
I mean,
she came incognito with
a hat down over her eyes.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.070
Describe the hat.

05:49.148 --> 05:51.412
It was black.
Kind of shiny and floppy.

05:51.484 --> 05:52.678
Mention where she was going?

05:52.752 --> 05:53.810
No.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.050
I mean,
but, you know,
she was a cute Iittle hottie,

05:56.122 --> 05:58.886
and I watched her
walk across the street
into the Royal Arms.

05:58.958 --> 06:00.550
Get your ass up.

06:06.766 --> 06:07.755
Sorry.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.563
She was wearing
a black floppy hat.

06:09.635 --> 06:12.536
FIoppy. Look, Iike this.
Covered half her face.

06:12.605 --> 06:14.402
Oh, okay. The cutie pie.

06:14.474 --> 06:15.941
She met a guy
in the Iobby.

06:16.709 --> 06:17.869
STABLER: She a pro?

06:17.944 --> 06:19.275
Didn't Iook Iike one.

06:19.345 --> 06:20.812
Could you describe the guy?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.711
CIientele tends to blur.

06:22.782 --> 06:25.683
But white, 30s, kind of buff.

06:26.352 --> 06:29.617
Are you telling me this wasn't
a business transaction?

06:29.689 --> 06:31.384
He was trying to hump her
in the Iobby.

06:31.457 --> 06:34.153
She's Miss Arm's Length.
"Let's sit and talk."

06:34.227 --> 06:36.252
He practically
dragged her up the stairs.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.318
Did she ask for help?

06:37.397 --> 06:38.523
Nah.

06:39.632 --> 06:41.862
We're going to need his name
and his room number.

06:45.805 --> 06:48.569
Dover, Room 406. Paid cash.

06:48.641 --> 06:49.767
Ben Dover.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.471
Is he still up there?

06:54.547 --> 06:56.344
We're a by-the-hour
establishment.

06:57.283 --> 06:59.774
Tell me that room
hasn't been cleaned yet.

06:59.852 --> 07:01.319
Not since '72.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.548
Looks Iike this is where
she was raped.

07:05.625 --> 07:06.751
If there was a rape.

07:06.826 --> 07:08.851
Humor me.
At Ieast give me
that there was a struggle.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.897
Bet you there's got to be
a thousand DNA samples
on that bedspread.

07:11.964 --> 07:13.522
From this week alone.

07:13.599 --> 07:16.727
My question is,
how does she wind up dead
two blocks away from here?

07:17.370 --> 07:20.271
She breaks free,
he chases after her,

07:20.339 --> 07:22.307
when he catches up,
bye-bye.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.673
He didn't Ieave
anything here.
But she did.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.336
Cute hat.

07:26.412 --> 07:27.674
And informative.

07:28.514 --> 07:31.005
"Made Exclusively
for Destination."

07:35.721 --> 07:38.019
The hats are this way.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.690
Pretty swanky.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.819
What's our girl
doing shopping here?

07:46.732 --> 07:48.723
They're adorable,
aren't they?
We just got them in.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.632
How much are they?
Seven ninety-five.

07:50.703 --> 07:53.763
She managed
to find the only
affordable thing in here.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.570
That would be $795.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.303
Oh. Well,
that'II max out
your credit card.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.507
Could you pull
the sales receipts for these?

08:03.583 --> 08:04.948
Certainly.

08:05.017 --> 08:08.316
There can't be that many.
At that price, I don't see
them flying off the shelves.

08:08.387 --> 08:10.321
WOMAN:
Well, they're projected to.

08:10.389 --> 08:12.721
Of course, we just
got them in yesterday.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.322
That's odd.
We haven't sold any yet.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.090
Sorry.

08:20.132 --> 08:22.191
I understand you caught
a shoplifter for me.

08:22.268 --> 08:23.735
Maybe you can return
the favor.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.202
We'II settle for a name.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.967
If they'd caught her before,
she'd have been banned
from the store.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.871
Maybe she slipped
by security?

08:29.942 --> 08:31.204
She slipped out of here
with that hat.

08:31.277 --> 08:33.245
LAUDEN: My Loss Prevention
Consultant keeps begging me

08:33.312 --> 08:36.212
to use those horrible
electronic surveillance tags,

08:36.282 --> 08:37.578
but they stretch
the fabrics.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.947
Got her.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.746
Why doesn't this one
have a name?

08:42.822 --> 08:44.221
February 18.

08:44.290 --> 08:46.121
That was
our President's Day sale.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.557
I remember that.

08:47.627 --> 08:51.085
She was caught stuffing
a cashmere sweater in her bag.

08:51.163 --> 08:52.494
Of course,
we pressed charges.

08:52.565 --> 08:54.931
Then you should
have received
a copy of a "61"

08:55.001 --> 08:56.332
or a criminal court
complaint.

08:56.402 --> 08:58.700
Either one should
have her name on it.

08:59.605 --> 09:00.629
Nothing.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.901
She was picked up
by an Officer SIater.

09:03.309 --> 09:04.503
We never heard back.

09:04.744 --> 09:06.234
Yeah, thanks.

09:17.156 --> 09:18.851
Catching any speeders?

09:18.925 --> 09:20.222
Do I know you?

09:20.293 --> 09:22.022
SIater, right?
Yeah.

09:22.328 --> 09:23.488
SVU.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.329
We caught a Jane Doe
this morning,

09:29.402 --> 09:30.767
and every turn
we're coming up blank,

09:30.836 --> 09:32.201
ending with you.

09:32.805 --> 09:35.797
I don't follow you.
Okay.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.570
This girl pulled
a Winona at Destination

09:37.643 --> 09:39.702
two months ago.
You picked her up.

09:39.779 --> 09:42.373
Why can't we find
any arrest records?

09:43.416 --> 09:44.906
She wouldn't give me her name.

09:44.984 --> 09:47.316
My sarge says
if she gives it up

09:47.386 --> 09:48.876
we'II just give her
a desk appearance.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.923
Did she go
for the D.A.T.?

09:51.657 --> 09:54.182
Yeah.
Then what's her name?

10:00.566 --> 10:02.056
BENSON: Excuse me.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.261
We need you to pull
a Desk Appearance Ticket

10:04.337 --> 10:07.033
issued 2-1802

10:07.106 --> 10:08.698
for a Patricia Stephens.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.404
Is that a problem?

10:13.479 --> 10:14.912
Sorry. What was the name?

10:14.981 --> 10:17.313
Stephens.
Stephens, with a "P-H."

10:19.752 --> 10:23.313
Steingard, Stelherd, Stemple.

10:23.389 --> 10:24.378
No. I don't see it.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.446
Oh, come on.

10:25.524 --> 10:28.118
Well, maybe
it was misspelled.
Try it with a "V"'

10:28.461 --> 10:30.190
No. Look,
I really have to close.

10:30.262 --> 10:32.560
BENSON: Listen, Iady,
the girl's dead.

10:32.698 --> 10:35.064
So if she's got parents,
I'm not going to Iet them
spend the night

10:35.134 --> 10:36.897
going out of their mind
not knowing,

10:36.969 --> 10:39.164
so please keep Iooking.

10:39.238 --> 10:40.637
Patricia's dead?

10:40.706 --> 10:42.196
STABLER:
You know this girl?

10:43.676 --> 10:45.007
You don't know who she is,
do you?

10:45.077 --> 10:47.944
That's what we've spent
this entire miserable day
trying to find out.

10:48.014 --> 10:49.447
Who is she?

10:50.116 --> 10:52.209
Judge Thornburg's daughter.

10:54.453 --> 10:57.354
Why did it have to
be the stepdaughter
of a hanging judge?

10:57.423 --> 11:01.325
Thornburg's sentence on
the SoHo Youth Center rapes
came down Iast week.

11:01.427 --> 11:04.362
Father Kelly's
doing 25-to-Iife
before he burns in hell.

11:04.430 --> 11:07.627
And we get to pay him back by
telling him his pill-popping,
shoplifting stepdaughter

11:07.700 --> 11:10.066
was murdered Ieaving
some seedy sex hotel.

11:10.136 --> 11:11.160
CRAGEN: Yeah? What?

11:11.237 --> 11:13.865
Came by to Iet you know
we ID'd the girl.
Good.

11:13.939 --> 11:15.429
Going to notify
the parents.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.271
Worst part of the job.
Sorry.

11:17.376 --> 11:19.401
Yeah, well, this one
hit one of our own.

11:19.478 --> 11:21.309
CRAGEN: A cop's daughter?
A judge's.

11:21.380 --> 11:22.642
Thornburg.

11:25.284 --> 11:26.512
I know Walt.
Who doesn't?

11:26.585 --> 11:29.053
We've testified
in his court
a hundred times.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.983
We have history.

11:32.058 --> 11:33.355
We both went to St. John's.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.984
I run into Walt
at every function.

11:35.061 --> 11:36.153
He has two small sons.

11:36.228 --> 11:37.718
I didn't even know
he had a daughter.

11:37.797 --> 11:39.662
Stepdaughter.
She was 16.

11:39.732 --> 11:40.960
So it's true?

11:42.101 --> 11:43.728
It's already hit
the courthouse grapevine?

11:43.803 --> 11:44.997
This is huge.

11:45.071 --> 11:46.197
My boss is going
to want to know

11:46.272 --> 11:47.398
where you are
on this every minute.

11:47.473 --> 11:49.737
Well, tell her
we're going to notify
the judge and his wife

11:49.809 --> 11:51.037
before Channel 5 does.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.634
CRAGEN: No, it's okay.

11:54.113 --> 11:55.842
I'm doing this one.

12:01.153 --> 12:02.313
Don.

12:02.655 --> 12:03.644
Hello, Brook.

12:05.257 --> 12:06.383
Is Walter here?

12:06.459 --> 12:07.653
He's in the den.

12:08.994 --> 12:10.393
Is something wrong?

12:13.866 --> 12:15.857
Why don't you
go Iie down?

12:15.935 --> 12:17.903
We have to tell
Josh and Brian.

12:17.970 --> 12:19.938
CRAGEN:
I won't keep you Iong.

12:21.207 --> 12:22.572
She was raped?

12:23.609 --> 12:26.305
We're investigating it
as a rape-homicide, yes.

12:26.846 --> 12:27.972
When?

12:28.214 --> 12:30.205
She was found
about 11:00 this morning.

12:31.383 --> 12:32.372
Where?

12:32.718 --> 12:34.310
Hell's Kitchen.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.789
Do you have any idea
what she would be doing
in that part of town?

12:37.857 --> 12:39.324
No.
Does Brook have
to be here for this?

12:39.391 --> 12:41.154
No. No. Of course not.

12:41.227 --> 12:42.592
I'II be with you
in a minute, okay?

12:42.661 --> 12:43.787
AII right.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.464
We can drop
the niceties now.

12:51.871 --> 12:54.635
She's been a problem child
since puberty.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.901
Trust me.

12:58.010 --> 13:01.173
I am Iong past the point
of being shocked.

13:01.247 --> 13:03.841
What kind of trouble
had she been in?

13:04.250 --> 13:06.241
When Brook and I
got together

13:06.318 --> 13:08.377
five years ago,
she went wild.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.485
We tried discipline,
therapy.

13:11.557 --> 13:14.321
Finally had to send
her to boarding school.

13:14.393 --> 13:16.361
How Iong had
she been back?

13:16.428 --> 13:18.589
A year,
going to St. Monica's.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.960
Brook got a phone call
from the school this morning.

13:24.103 --> 13:26.333
Patricia ditched
just after roll call.

13:26.772 --> 13:27.932
What did you do?

13:30.142 --> 13:31.871
Absolutely nothing.

13:34.713 --> 13:38.672
Truancy was
just her Iatest method
of torturing Brook and me.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.810
Before that
it was body piercing.

13:40.886 --> 13:42.478
Before that it was a tattoo.

13:49.094 --> 13:50.459
TREVOR: Doesn't match
any known gang tats.

13:50.529 --> 13:51.894
STABLER: Do we know
what she was hit with?

13:51.964 --> 13:53.932
ME pulled glass shards
out of her scalp,

13:53.999 --> 13:55.296
which match
color and thickness

13:55.367 --> 13:56.698
with a broken
beer bottle found here.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.100
That's where
she took the blow.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.297
Yes.
But see the spatter pattern?

14:00.372 --> 14:02.067
Based on its trajectory,
and height of the victim,

14:02.141 --> 14:03.870
I'd say
she was standing here,

14:03.943 --> 14:05.877
while her attacker
came at her from the south,

14:05.945 --> 14:07.674
swinging from right to Ieft.

14:07.746 --> 14:10.681
From here, droplets of blood
form a serpentine pattern
to the stairs.

14:10.749 --> 14:11.738
STABLER:
She was staggering?

14:11.817 --> 14:13.216
And continue
down the steps,

14:13.285 --> 14:15.014
alternating between
round drops and smudges,

14:15.087 --> 14:16.850
suggesting she cartwheeled
head-over-heels.

14:16.922 --> 14:18.856
Smudges being where
her head hit the steps?

14:18.924 --> 14:20.949
Until she Ianded
hard at the bottom,

14:21.026 --> 14:22.721
where she Iay unconscious
for at Ieast 15 minutes,

14:22.795 --> 14:24.763
as you can see
from the pool of blood.

14:24.830 --> 14:27.663
This bottle, any pieces
big enough for prints?

14:28.367 --> 14:29.891
Follow me.

14:29.969 --> 14:32.062
After identifying
the type of bottle used,

14:32.137 --> 14:35.766
I bought the same brand
and filled it
with plaster of Paris.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.335
Now comes the fun part.

14:41.847 --> 14:44.645
We tap-tap-tap all over,
cracking it Iike an egg.

14:47.286 --> 14:49.254
And then
we take the glass
from the crime scene,

14:49.321 --> 14:50.948
which I have right here.

14:51.023 --> 14:52.923
You Iike jigsaw puzzles,
Detective?

14:53.192 --> 14:56.958
You're kidding me.
There must be a thousand
pieces in there.

14:58.364 --> 15:00.059
Nine hundred and ninety-nine
to go.

15:00.132 --> 15:01.793
I'II Iet you know
if I get a print.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.365
SISTER KAY:
Patricia was a smart girl

15:07.439 --> 15:10.340
and the classes
she showed up for,
she did very well in.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.604
Unfortunately she was
a discipline problem.

15:12.678 --> 15:13.702
Fights?

15:13.779 --> 15:16.612
No. Her hostility
was restricted
to authority figures.

15:16.682 --> 15:17.706
A rule breaker.

15:17.783 --> 15:21.116
She'd talk back,
walk into class
10 minutes after the bell,

15:21.186 --> 15:23.780
and we suspected
she was defiling
her body.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.687
You're talking about
her tattoo and piercings?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.817
That and she was sent
to the nurse's office

15:27.893 --> 15:29.451
a few months ago
with cuts on her arms.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.826
Wait.
She was cutting herself?

15:31.897 --> 15:32.921
Yes.

15:32.998 --> 15:34.022
How often?

15:34.099 --> 15:35.691
Just the once that we know of.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.998
If she was cutting,
it was a cry for help.

15:38.070 --> 15:40.630
Or a way to make herself
feel alive.

15:40.706 --> 15:41.934
Did she have
any friends here?

15:42.007 --> 15:45.272
It was sad. She never
did manage to fit in.

15:45.344 --> 15:47.904
There's only one girl
I ever saw her friendly with.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.709
And where can we find her?

15:53.352 --> 15:56.014
BENSON: Making up for
the classes you ditched?

15:57.856 --> 15:59.255
Am I in trouble?

15:59.325 --> 16:02.590
You were
with Tricia Stephens
yesterday, weren't you?

16:03.696 --> 16:05.789
I can't believe
she's dead.

16:06.799 --> 16:10.792
Mary, you need to tell us
everything that happened.

16:11.937 --> 16:14.030
I never should have Ieft her.

16:14.106 --> 16:15.300
Left her where?

16:16.608 --> 16:17.597
Destination.

16:17.676 --> 16:19.940
I never skip school,
I swear.

16:20.012 --> 16:21.274
Trish dragged me along.

16:21.347 --> 16:22.939
To steal a hat?

16:23.015 --> 16:24.642
I had no idea
she was going to do it.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.708
I was furious,
so I took off.

16:26.785 --> 16:28.616
How Iong had you been friends?

16:28.687 --> 16:30.348
Practically
since she came here.

16:30.723 --> 16:31.985
We both Iove the classics.

16:32.057 --> 16:34.355
Sophocles, Euripides,
Aeschylus...

16:34.426 --> 16:35.484
BENSON: Tragedies.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.426
We were both very drawn
to them.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.164
And why is that?
She having boyfriend troubles?

16:40.232 --> 16:43.429
No. Trish never
had a boyfriend.
I mean, not really.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.202
Define "really"'

16:47.172 --> 16:49.902
Well, there are guys
that she wrote to.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.805
Like pen pals?
Right.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.072
How many?

16:56.148 --> 16:57.172
A bunch.

16:57.249 --> 16:58.546
She didn't think
her parents would understand,

16:58.617 --> 17:00.608
so all the Ietters
came to my house.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.654
Why was she afraid
to tell her parents?

17:03.722 --> 17:04.915
They were strict.

17:04.990 --> 17:06.981
They didn't
get the real Trish.
She had a good heart.

17:07.059 --> 17:10.028
She was doing God's work.
Reaching out to Iost souls.

17:10.462 --> 17:12.123
Who was she writing to?

17:13.732 --> 17:15.131
Prisoners.

17:18.270 --> 17:19.601
Funny,
for a tragedy buff,

17:19.671 --> 17:21.262
I haven't seen
any references yet

17:21.339 --> 17:22.807
to Hamlet or King Lear.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.604
Wasn't it Shakespeare
who wrote,

17:24.675 --> 17:26.940
"I want to do you
on the stove top"?

17:27.012 --> 17:28.536
Where did you find these?

17:28.614 --> 17:30.275
Patricia's school Iocker.

17:30.616 --> 17:33.608
She's been
pen-palling with
five different convicts.

17:33.685 --> 17:36.449
Ray Dayton, Thomas Gordon.

17:36.522 --> 17:39.719
Dayton went away
for murder two.
Gordon, man one.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.886
John Furmen, Louis Knapp,
AIden Reed.

17:42.961 --> 17:45.452
Murder, murder,
and, what do you know?

17:45.531 --> 17:46.759
Murder.

17:46.832 --> 17:48.732
This girl wanted for nothing.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.201
Good family, money,
best education.

17:51.270 --> 17:53.170
Now what was she doing
writing to killers?

17:53.238 --> 17:54.762
It's the ultimate rebellion.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.206
I mean, Iook at preachers'
kids, principals' kids.

17:57.276 --> 17:58.607
FIN: Cops' kids.

17:59.445 --> 18:01.174
Hey, good girls
go for bad boys.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.373
From what I hear,
this girl was nothing
but trouble.

18:03.449 --> 18:05.144
Death Row inmates
get the most groupies

18:05.217 --> 18:07.879
and those whack jobs come
from all walks of Iife.

18:07.953 --> 18:10.285
What years were these
five skels convicted?

18:10.355 --> 18:11.720
AII early '90s.

18:11.790 --> 18:14.350
Time off for good behavior,
any one of them could be
out on parole.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.950
Why don't you
give me that Iist?

18:16.028 --> 18:17.996
I'II have Cabot check
in the D.A"s system.

18:18.063 --> 18:20.497
No. I'II handle this.

18:23.502 --> 18:25.060
One of your guys
is at Sing Sing,

18:25.137 --> 18:27.435
three are at Attica
and one just got out
a week ago.

18:27.506 --> 18:30.270
Which one?
Thomas "Bird" Gordon.

18:30.342 --> 18:34.574
Got the max for man one.
Actually did 12 of the 15.

18:34.646 --> 18:37.342
Seems Mr. Gordon gets
a Iittle grabby with women.

18:37.416 --> 18:40.283
Priors include two counts
of sex abuse three.

18:40.352 --> 18:43.014
Don,
I think you better
take a Iook at this.

18:44.923 --> 18:46.515
See their trial judges?

18:51.063 --> 18:52.655
It's Thornburg.

18:52.731 --> 18:56.030
Daddy's a judge
and she's seeking out
the men he convicted.

18:56.101 --> 18:58.069
What is going on
with this girl?

19:09.014 --> 19:10.208
(SIREN WAILING)

19:10.282 --> 19:11.408
What happened here?

19:11.483 --> 19:12.848
OFFICER: A guy got shot.

19:12.918 --> 19:16.376
They took him
to the hospital.
Said he's a judge.

19:16.455 --> 19:18.116
Judge Thornburg.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.394
Here you go.
Thanks.

19:27.466 --> 19:29.127
How is he?

19:29.201 --> 19:32.398
He's still in surgery.
No one will tell me
anything.

19:32.471 --> 19:34.132
I know this is difficult.

19:34.239 --> 19:36.002
But can you tell me
what happened?

19:38.410 --> 19:41.345
I was in the kitchen
with Josh and Brian.

19:42.214 --> 19:45.615
The housekeeper was
helping me make Iunch.
I'd...

19:47.519 --> 19:49.487
I'd just talked to
Walter on his cell,

19:49.555 --> 19:51.853
to see if he wanted
a sandwich, too.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.915
Take your time. Let's...

19:56.595 --> 19:58.324
About five minutes Iater

19:59.031 --> 20:00.020
there was a shot,

20:00.098 --> 20:02.623
just Iike
it was outside the door.

20:03.735 --> 20:06.533
And I rushed out there

20:06.638 --> 20:08.697
and he was on the ground,
bleeding.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.241
Did you see anyone?

20:11.610 --> 20:13.202
I didn't Iook.

20:14.313 --> 20:16.440
AII I could see was Walter.

20:17.649 --> 20:19.378
It doesn't make any sense.

20:19.651 --> 20:21.209
Where was he coming from?

20:22.154 --> 20:23.280
Court.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.624
He'd gone in to
clear his calendar,

20:28.994 --> 20:33.397
then we were going to
make funeral arrangements.

20:35.234 --> 20:40.001
Mrs. Thornburg,
is there anybody
that you could think of

20:40.072 --> 20:42.666
that might want to
hurt your husband?

20:44.509 --> 20:45.703
(SIGHS)

20:45.777 --> 20:47.836
No. I mean...

20:49.948 --> 20:52.007
I'm sure there are people
he's sent to prison

20:52.384 --> 20:54.045
that are holding grudges,

20:55.454 --> 20:57.888
but we haven't received
any threats.

21:00.792 --> 21:03.022
Did you know that
your daughter was writing

21:03.295 --> 21:05.593
to some of the men
that your husband put away?

21:07.199 --> 21:08.461
What?

21:09.134 --> 21:12.729
We're Iooking at
one of them as a suspect
in your daughter's murder.

21:12.804 --> 21:15.466
She ever mention someone
called Thomas Gordon?

21:17.109 --> 21:18.337
No.

21:21.913 --> 21:24.609
Do you think he's the one
who tried to kill my husband?

21:29.221 --> 21:32.315
He's been out a week.
Don't tell me he's broken
his parole already.

21:32.391 --> 21:34.757
He's Iooking good
for a rape-murder.
That fit your guy?

21:34.826 --> 21:36.020
Like a glass slipper.

21:36.094 --> 21:37.721
Right before
he got sent up,

21:37.796 --> 21:39.127
my Iittle princess
was a suspect

21:39.197 --> 21:41.324
in a rash of break-in
rapes in Brooklyn.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.662
Never enough to arrest.

21:42.734 --> 21:43.860
What's your take
on this guy?

21:43.935 --> 21:45.300
The guy's got
a faulty transmitter.

21:45.370 --> 21:46.928
Doesn't receive signals
too clearly.

21:47.005 --> 21:49.064
Ladies say "no,"
he hears "yes"'

21:49.474 --> 21:51.237
But he never killed
one of them.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.334
How'd your girl buy it?

21:52.411 --> 21:53.503
STABLER: Bottle to the head.

21:53.578 --> 21:55.307
Tumbled down
a flight of stairs.

21:55.881 --> 21:57.212
Deja vu.

21:58.183 --> 22:00.708
Tommy's
manslaughter convictions
stem from a bar fight.

22:00.786 --> 22:02.151
Severed a guy's carotid.

22:02.220 --> 22:03.209
FIN: With what?

22:03.288 --> 22:04.516
His version?

22:04.589 --> 22:07.353
The other guy threw himself
on the broken beer bottle

22:07.426 --> 22:08.916
he just happened
to be holding.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.052
Where's he at?

22:10.128 --> 22:13.655
He was paroled to
his sister's address
in Queens.

22:13.732 --> 22:15.996
Works at her husband's garage.

22:17.903 --> 22:19.165
What do you want with Tommy?

22:19.237 --> 22:20.636
We need to have
a Iittle chat with him.

22:20.706 --> 22:23.402
Why don't you Ieave a card
and I'II have him give you
a call?

22:23.475 --> 22:26.672
2:00 in the afternoon
and he's done for the day?

22:26.745 --> 22:28.940
So much for
Employee of the Month, huh?

22:29.014 --> 22:31.175
He's on parole. You need
to tell us where he is.

22:31.249 --> 22:33.240
Tell me
what you want with him.

22:33.318 --> 22:34.751
The judge
who sent your brother up,

22:34.820 --> 22:36.048
someone took
a potshot at him.

22:36.121 --> 22:39.284
Good, because that judge
had it out for Tommy
from the beginning.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.518
Tommy did not do it.

22:40.592 --> 22:42.219
Did he come to work
yesterday?

22:42.294 --> 22:44.387
Yeah.
He comes to work every day.

22:44.463 --> 22:46.795
Is that true, Mr. Degalio?

22:46.865 --> 22:48.696
My wife,
she dotes on that worm.

22:48.767 --> 22:51.031
The second he shows up,
I find things to do
in the attic.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.092
Tony!

22:52.170 --> 22:53.467
Shut up, Sharlene.

22:53.538 --> 22:56.234
Yeah, he showed up.
Just Iong enough to
ask for the morning off.

22:56.308 --> 22:57.900
FIN: What for?

22:57.976 --> 23:00.467
The guy's a sludge.
He's been in prison
a Iong time.

23:00.545 --> 23:02.274
He said he was getting
a piece of tail.

23:02.347 --> 23:04.508
What, is there a Iaw
against that?

23:05.317 --> 23:07.251
Did he mention
this piece of tail by name?

23:07.319 --> 23:09.184
Yeah. "Sweet young thing"'

23:09.388 --> 23:11.379
The way he goes on,
she's burning hot for him.

23:11.456 --> 23:13.253
Cat-in-heat hot.
Wants to do these things...

23:13.325 --> 23:15.020
Okay,
they get the picture.

23:15.093 --> 23:17.323
What time did
he clock back in?
See, that's the thing.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.455
He not only
doesn't show up
for the rest of the day,

23:19.531 --> 23:22.022
he never returns my van,
that Iow-Iife Ioser.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.897
You're telling me he didn't
come home Iast night?

23:23.969 --> 23:25.027
Of course he did.

23:25.103 --> 23:26.730
Sir?
TONY: No, he didn't.

23:26.805 --> 23:28.102
Describe the van.

23:28.173 --> 23:32.735
'97 Ford E-150.
Customized it myself.

23:32.811 --> 23:37.305
Hydraulic camshaft,
351-Windsor V8,
dual exhaust...

23:37.382 --> 23:38.679
Just need a plate number.

23:39.618 --> 23:41.745
BQY-2064.

23:41.820 --> 23:42.878
STABLER: And maybe a color?

23:42.954 --> 23:45.388
Gold four-tone paint job
with flames.

23:46.691 --> 23:48.488
Thanks for your help.

23:50.061 --> 23:52.757
Got uniforms on the judge
and his wife round the clock.

23:52.831 --> 23:55.823
Good.
Yeah, you heard me right.
Gold with flames.

23:55.901 --> 23:57.391
Tommy have any friends?

23:57.469 --> 23:59.130
None who made the trip
upstate to visit.

23:59.204 --> 24:00.967
FIN: Other than Sis,
no Iiving relatives.

24:01.039 --> 24:02.199
Well, he's out there,
people,

24:02.274 --> 24:04.208
and according to ballistics
from the judge's shooting,

24:04.276 --> 24:06.267
armed with
a.380 semi-automatic.

24:06.344 --> 24:08.005
He simmered in the cage
for 12 years,

24:08.079 --> 24:09.569
building up hate,
planning his revenge.

24:09.648 --> 24:11.275
He's out one week,
we already Iike him

24:11.349 --> 24:12.907
for attempted murder,
rape-homicide.

24:12.984 --> 24:14.315
BENSON:
High stress on the run.

24:14.386 --> 24:15.580
He's not going down easy.

24:15.654 --> 24:18.487
Well, I say
he's going to get
back to his comfort zone.

24:18.557 --> 24:20.081
We know any
of his old haunts?

24:20.158 --> 24:23.889
Well, he was busted
for drunk and disorderly
at a place called O'Malley's.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.396
His sex charges stem
from playing grab-ass
with some stripper

24:26.465 --> 24:27.523
down in the Bowery.

24:27.599 --> 24:29.533
Split up. Hit them all.

24:34.773 --> 24:36.707
(MUSIC PLAYING)

24:46.117 --> 24:47.311
Seen this ugly mug around?

24:47.385 --> 24:48.613
Oh, yeah, that's Bird.

24:48.687 --> 24:50.951
He used to come in
back when I was performing.

24:51.022 --> 24:52.387
Prison didn't teach him
no manners.

24:52.457 --> 24:54.186
He still can't
keep his hands
to himself.

24:54.259 --> 24:55.692
When was the Iast time
he was in here?

24:55.760 --> 24:57.159
A couple days ago.

24:57.229 --> 24:58.787
He was pounding them down
all afternoon.

24:58.864 --> 25:01.162
Keeps trying to hit on
Sheila over there.

25:01.233 --> 25:04.760
Suddenly he jumps up
on the stage and starts
doing the hump dance with her.

25:04.836 --> 25:07.930
Tossed him out on his head,
told him never to come back.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.167
You think
I could talk to Sheila?

25:10.242 --> 25:12.210
Twenty bucks will get you
three minutes.

25:13.678 --> 25:17.944
So, Tommy Bird,
did he ever get violent
with any of the girls?

25:18.016 --> 25:19.005
Not that I heard of.

25:19.084 --> 25:22.212
But the more sloshed he gets,
the more touchy-feely.

25:22.287 --> 25:23.652
Looks Iike a cop.

25:23.722 --> 25:26.589
She's cool.
Wants to know
about the humpmeister.

25:26.658 --> 25:28.023
Bad tipper.

25:32.931 --> 25:34.592
So, you had a conversation
with him?

25:34.666 --> 25:35.690
Yeah.

25:35.767 --> 25:37.632
I say, "Leave me alone,"
he don't Iisten.

25:37.702 --> 25:40.296
He keeps after me
to hook up after work.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.703
Did he have a place in mind?

25:41.773 --> 25:43.934
Yeah, some bar
up the street. Falcone's.

25:48.780 --> 25:49.804
Hello, Thomas.

25:49.881 --> 25:51.473
I've been sitting on the van.
Any sign of him?

25:51.550 --> 25:54.314
No, but I found something
very interesting
while I was waiting.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.183
FIN: You got a warrant?

25:56.254 --> 25:58.848
That's all I'm waiting for
to make it Iegal for me
to take this.

25:58.924 --> 26:00.721
There's our.380.

26:00.792 --> 26:03.022
Recently fired.
Let's do it.

26:08.366 --> 26:09.924
(MUSIC PLAYING)

26:12.671 --> 26:13.899
Sit down.

26:21.513 --> 26:22.810
What's going on?

26:22.881 --> 26:24.849
Arresting your punk ass.
For what?

26:24.916 --> 26:26.907
Parole violation.
Oh, man.

26:26.985 --> 26:29.385
You have the right
to remain silent.
Anything you say can...

26:29.454 --> 26:30.785
Can I just finish my beer?

26:30.855 --> 26:32.322
He's clean.
Let's go.

26:32.390 --> 26:33.584
You got a right to attorney.

26:33.658 --> 26:35.819
You puke in my car
I'm going to kill your ass.

26:35.894 --> 26:38.419
If you cannot afford
an attorney, one will be...

26:39.931 --> 26:42.195
Tommy, we got you.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.896
Your DNA matches the fluids
we found in Patricia Stephens.

26:46.504 --> 26:48.870
Never heard of her.
Oh, come on,
your sweet young thing.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.202
The one with the floppy hat?

26:50.275 --> 26:52.470
If that bitch is saying rape,
she's Iying.

26:52.544 --> 26:54.409
Oh, Tommy,
she's not saying anything.

26:54.479 --> 26:55.912
She's dead.

26:56.514 --> 26:57.572
What?

26:58.016 --> 26:59.005
No way.

27:00.051 --> 27:01.382
She was alive
when I Ieft her.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.478
You raped her,
you beat her to a bloody pulp

27:03.555 --> 27:05.420
and you Ieft her to die
while you tracked down
her old man.

27:05.490 --> 27:07.219
No, no, no, no.
Yeah, yeah!

27:07.292 --> 27:10.284
Sweetheart, we matched
the bullet to your gun.

27:11.663 --> 27:12.925
AII right, Iook.

27:12.998 --> 27:14.465
Maybe I took
a shot at the judge,

27:14.532 --> 27:15.965
but he sabotaged
my defense.

27:16.034 --> 27:17.433
He blocked my parole.

27:17.502 --> 27:19.868
Twelve prime years
wasted in prison?
I'd want someone dead.

27:19.938 --> 27:22.031
Yeah, but not too quick.
I'd want to torture
him first,

27:22.107 --> 27:23.734
maybe rape and kill
the stepdaughter.

27:23.808 --> 27:24.797
What are you talking about?

27:24.876 --> 27:27.606
I didn't even know
they were related
till yesterday.

27:27.679 --> 27:29.613
Hey, you got to believe me!

27:29.681 --> 27:31.876
This shooting thing,
it wasn't my idea.

27:31.950 --> 27:33.975
It was that stupid slut
got me all revved up!

27:34.052 --> 27:36.520
Tommy! Weak, very weak.

27:36.588 --> 27:38.385
Hey, I didn't go
Iooking for her.

27:38.757 --> 27:40.349
She wrote to me first.

27:40.425 --> 27:42.518
I got the Ietters
to prove it.

27:42.894 --> 27:44.794
So why you, Tommy?

27:45.263 --> 27:46.821
Why did she pick you?

27:47.966 --> 27:49.228
Chicks.

27:50.535 --> 27:52.162
One day
I'm sitting in my cell,

27:52.771 --> 27:54.534
she writes to me
out of the blue.

27:55.573 --> 27:58.565
Promises me sex
beyond my wildest dreams.

27:58.910 --> 28:01.708
You must've done
something really good
in a previous Iife.

28:03.048 --> 28:05.482
I thought I finally
found my dream girl.

28:05.550 --> 28:09.281
She said she'd do anything,
anytime, anywhere.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.481
Get me anything I needed.

28:11.556 --> 28:12.682
And what did you need?

28:13.892 --> 28:16.793
I got a condition
requires Percocet.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.294
She said she could
bring me some,

28:18.363 --> 28:19.955
but that turned out
to be a Iie, too.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.464
Whatever. What happened?

28:21.533 --> 28:24.730
I get to the hotel,
I'm primed and ready,
if you know what I mean

28:24.803 --> 28:26.293
and all of sudden
she's got a headache.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.236
So you raped her!
No.

28:29.074 --> 28:30.735
I was past
the point of no return,

28:30.809 --> 28:32.777
so I seduced her.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.640
Hey, she knew
what she was doing.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.908
She got me all worked up.

28:45.256 --> 28:47.019
Then came the catch.

28:47.659 --> 28:49.320
And what was that?

28:51.129 --> 28:52.926
Kill her step-daddy.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.565
That's bull.

29:05.643 --> 29:07.372
We've got the Ietter
she sent him.

29:07.445 --> 29:08.707
He kept all of them,

29:08.780 --> 29:10.509
even though she wrote
on each one "please destroy"'

29:10.582 --> 29:13.483
So you have, in writing,
her request to kill her
stepfather?

29:13.551 --> 29:14.711
No.
I didn't think so.

29:14.786 --> 29:16.879
Did she even mention
who her stepfather was?

29:16.955 --> 29:18.286
She does mention a favor.

29:18.356 --> 29:20.824
STABLER:
She can't say what it is
until she sees him in person.

29:20.892 --> 29:24.555
So you're buying
the ex-con murdering
rapist's version?

29:24.629 --> 29:27.530
It's the same charge
whether it's his idea
or somebody else's.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.999
Why would he Iie?
That's what they do.

29:30.068 --> 29:31.433
But, Captain,
you got to admit

29:31.503 --> 29:33.232
Patricia was
doing a Iot of
questionable things.

29:33.304 --> 29:36.865
Let's just say,
for argument's sake,
that he's not Iying.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.636
Why would she
want him to do it?

29:39.444 --> 29:42.379
I don't know.
She was a sick girl.

29:46.384 --> 29:48.147
I think as far as
the Captain is concerned,

29:48.219 --> 29:49.516
this case is closed.

29:49.587 --> 29:50.679
Well, not for me.

29:50.755 --> 29:52.518
I want to know
what made her so sick.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.519
STABLER: Patricia was not
very popular.

29:58.596 --> 30:00.427
BENSON:
Mrs. Thornburg and the boys.

30:03.935 --> 30:05.232
Mrs. Thornburg.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.562
Wait.

30:07.605 --> 30:09.038
Oh, sorry.
We thought you were...

30:09.107 --> 30:10.665
I'm her sister, Erin.

30:10.742 --> 30:12.607
Brook's still
at the hospital.

30:12.677 --> 30:14.770
This is Detective Benson.
I'm Detective Stabler.

30:14.846 --> 30:16.438
We were working
Tricia's case.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.514
We came by
to pay our respects.

30:19.584 --> 30:21.176
Maybe if we could talk,

30:21.719 --> 30:23.949
at a more appropriate time,
of course.

30:24.022 --> 30:26.752
Thank God somebody is here
with Tricia's interests
at heart.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.656
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)
I'm sorry.

30:28.726 --> 30:30.387
You know? Why don't I
Iook after them for you?

30:30.461 --> 30:33.624
I've got a Iot of experience
wrangling kids.

30:36.601 --> 30:38.569
Patricia and the judge
didn't get along?

30:38.636 --> 30:40.069
Oil and water.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.269
That must have been
hard on your sister.
Oh, please.

30:44.342 --> 30:47.243
Her first husband
abandoned them
when Trish was five.

30:47.312 --> 30:51.009
Brook got a job
as a court reporter,
met the meal ticket.

30:51.082 --> 30:52.276
Judge Thornburg.

30:52.350 --> 30:55.217
And she wasn't going
to Iet Trish muck it up.

30:55.286 --> 30:57.481
That's why Trish
started acting out.

30:57.755 --> 30:59.814
That was his excuse
to get rid of her,

31:00.425 --> 31:01.790
start his own family.

31:02.861 --> 31:06.592
The second she was gone,
they get married.

31:06.664 --> 31:07.926
Adopt Brian six months Iater,

31:07.999 --> 31:09.626
get pregnant with Josh
immediately after that.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.532
Instant new family.

31:12.070 --> 31:14.129
And no room for Trish,
who's now conveniently
tucked away

31:14.205 --> 31:15.467
at boarding school.

31:16.941 --> 31:19.136
Trish never went
to boarding school.

31:19.844 --> 31:21.209
I don't understand.
I thought...

31:21.279 --> 31:23.304
Do you know
what a PINS petition is?

31:23.381 --> 31:25.076
Person In Need
of Supervision. Yeah.

31:25.149 --> 31:29.017
Just before she turned 12
he swore out one of those.

31:29.087 --> 31:31.317
Had her sent to kiddy prison.

31:37.629 --> 31:38.823
FIN: No offense.
You really believe

31:38.897 --> 31:40.194
she belonged
in a place Iike this?

31:40.265 --> 31:41.823
She'd been chronically
truant,

31:41.900 --> 31:43.527
shoplifting,
breaking curfew.

31:43.601 --> 31:45.125
It was a Iegitimate call.

31:45.203 --> 31:47.763
For someone
with no other options.
These people had money.

31:47.839 --> 31:49.136
We don't discriminate.

31:49.207 --> 31:50.401
These kids are
inner-city throwaways.

31:50.475 --> 31:53.035
They could have put Trish
in a boarding school,
a military school.

31:53.111 --> 31:55.477
Hell, even a charm school.
Money buys choices.

31:55.546 --> 31:57.810
It is unusual for
a family with means

31:57.882 --> 31:59.713
to go through
the family court system.

31:59.784 --> 32:01.251
We're talking a judge here.

32:01.319 --> 32:03.719
He knew exactly
what he was throwing her into.

32:03.788 --> 32:05.551
Abused kids,
mentally ill,

32:05.623 --> 32:07.818
straight-out
violent head cases.

32:07.892 --> 32:09.223
Which one was Trish?

32:09.294 --> 32:10.761
In her three years here,

32:10.828 --> 32:12.796
she never once
opened up in therapy.

32:12.864 --> 32:15.856
Serious trust issues.
What was the root of it?

32:20.171 --> 32:22.002
We suspected sexual abuse.

32:22.073 --> 32:23.404
Based on?

32:23.474 --> 32:28.776
The usual symptoms.
Hypervigilance, exaggerated
startled response, insomnia,

32:28.846 --> 32:30.541
the fact that she'd never
talk about the baby,

32:30.615 --> 32:33.846
somatic reactions
Iike nausea,
poor appetite...

32:33.918 --> 32:36.478
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What baby?

32:40.124 --> 32:43.787
Mrs. Thornburg, could we
talk to you for a moment?

32:45.763 --> 32:46.991
I was just taking the boys

32:47.065 --> 32:48.396
to the hospital
to see their father.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.024
We just have
a few questions,

32:50.101 --> 32:52.228
but they'd be better
asked in private.

32:55.173 --> 32:57.573
Ida, can you put Josh
in the car?

33:07.518 --> 33:08.542
What is it?

33:08.619 --> 33:11.747
Why didn't you tell us
about Patricia's pregnancy?

33:11.823 --> 33:13.620
What are you talking about?
I think you know.

33:13.691 --> 33:15.454
The real reason that you
sent her off to boot camp.

33:15.526 --> 33:17.494
She was 12 years old
and pregnant.

33:17.562 --> 33:18.893
You being a good Catholic,

33:18.963 --> 33:20.590
an abortion's
out of the question.

33:20.665 --> 33:23.566
You didn't send her to an RTC
to straighten her out,

33:23.634 --> 33:26.228
you sent her there
to conceal her condition.

33:26.304 --> 33:27.498
You don't know
what you're saying.

33:27.572 --> 33:30.939
Your adopted son, Brian.
We know he's Tricia's.

33:32.910 --> 33:34.377
How...
We did the math.

33:34.445 --> 33:35.878
Tricia had her baby
four years ago.

33:35.947 --> 33:37.710
Brian's just the right age.

33:38.449 --> 33:40.212
I need to be
with my husband.

33:40.885 --> 33:43.115
Mrs. Thornburg,
who's the father?

33:48.493 --> 33:50.927
Who's the father
of Tricia's baby?

33:56.234 --> 33:58.964
She told me
she didn't even know.

34:07.945 --> 34:09.572
They Iied about
the boarding school.

34:09.647 --> 34:11.342
Which timelines
with her pregnancy.

34:11.416 --> 34:13.043
Hospital records
just came in.

34:13.117 --> 34:16.848
Tricia's unnamed baby
has the same birth date
as Brian.

34:16.920 --> 34:18.183
I'm sorry, Captain.

34:18.255 --> 34:21.282
Adopting your underaged,
unwed daughter's baby
is not a crime.

34:21.359 --> 34:23.759
It is if you're the one
who knocked her up.

34:23.828 --> 34:24.954
CABOT: Judge Thornburg?

34:25.029 --> 34:26.963
One of the most respected
jurists in the state.

34:27.031 --> 34:28.396
Which doesn't mean
squat to me

34:28.466 --> 34:30.297
if he raped
an 11-year-old girl.

34:30.368 --> 34:32.802
Judge Thornburg.
I can't think of a judge

34:32.870 --> 34:34.496
who is tougher
on child molesters.

34:34.572 --> 34:35.971
Maybe he's a self-Ioather.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.063
Liv?

34:37.141 --> 34:38.630
There's only
one way to prove it.

34:38.708 --> 34:41.803
We have Tricia's DNA
from the ME's office

34:41.879 --> 34:44.177
and Judge Thornburg's
from the crime scene.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.148
AII we need is Brian's.

34:54.025 --> 34:56.219
You guys had
better be right.

34:59.297 --> 35:00.423
DONNELLY:
Let me get this straight.

35:00.498 --> 35:02.363
You want me
to Iet you take this

35:02.433 --> 35:04.697
to a judge
to sign a blood order,

35:04.769 --> 35:07.135
so that you can
take a DNA sample

35:07.205 --> 35:10.197
of one of their esteemed
colleagues' four-year-old son

35:10.274 --> 35:12.538
based on nothing more
than a wild theory?

35:12.610 --> 35:14.237
If you'II just Iook
at the attached exhibits.

35:14.312 --> 35:15.904
Does anyone allege
that this man

35:15.980 --> 35:17.880
was having sex
with his stepdaughter?

35:17.949 --> 35:20.543
No, but we have
a pattern of conduct.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.785
I have a signed affidavit
from a clerk

35:24.856 --> 35:27.518
who made Tricia's most recent
shoplifting charge disappear,

35:27.592 --> 35:29.651
at the request
of Judge Thornburg.

35:29.727 --> 35:31.888
Ever get a colleague to
fix a ticket for you, AIex?

35:31.963 --> 35:33.760
In the past, he manipulated
the system against her.

35:33.831 --> 35:35.594
So why is he
covering for her now?

35:35.666 --> 35:37.930
She was holding
something over him.

35:38.002 --> 35:38.969
Five years ago,

35:39.036 --> 35:40.697
he used the court
to hide his crime,

35:40.771 --> 35:42.204
bypass the system.

35:44.342 --> 35:47.937
Got a crony
to push through
the detention order.

35:48.012 --> 35:49.377
Had another
colleague falsify

35:49.447 --> 35:52.439
Brian's adoption papers
and his birth certificate.
Uh-huh.

35:52.517 --> 35:54.314
But no proof of sex.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.142
No.

35:56.754 --> 35:59.587
Yet, you're willing to risk
your future and my reputation.

35:59.657 --> 36:01.420
Need I remind you
that I am responsible

36:01.492 --> 36:03.585
for the integrity
of this entire bureau?

36:04.529 --> 36:07.760
A judge has used
the power of the court
to further his own agenda.

36:07.832 --> 36:10.858
If the Iight we shine on him
isn't brighter than the Iight
we shine on the public,

36:10.935 --> 36:13.335
then this bureau
has no integrity.

36:17.475 --> 36:20.137
I wouldn't want to be you
if he's not the father.

36:33.324 --> 36:35.121
How are you feeling?

36:37.128 --> 36:39.255
Not much Iike talking, Don.

36:40.531 --> 36:44.433
I'm afraid I have extended
all the professional courtesy
I can.

36:46.904 --> 36:51.238
I'm sure Brook told you
we ran a paternity test
on Brian.

36:53.978 --> 36:55.741
He's yours, Walter.

36:57.014 --> 36:59.107
You raped that Iittle girl.

37:01.185 --> 37:03.551
Don't ask me
for an explanation.

37:06.023 --> 37:08.651
I've searched
the depths of my soul,

37:11.529 --> 37:14.259
and I can't for the Iife of me
find one.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.593
What happened?

37:20.404 --> 37:21.769
Did she threaten
to expose you?

37:21.839 --> 37:23.329
Is that why you killed her?

37:25.343 --> 37:27.106
You have the person
that killed her,

37:28.412 --> 37:29.879
the scum who shot me.

37:32.049 --> 37:35.576
You just don't get it,
do you, Walter? It's over.

37:36.554 --> 37:40.513
And the Ieast you could do
is give me the courtesy
of the truth.

37:42.593 --> 37:45.619
You can't really believe
that I killed her?

37:45.696 --> 37:47.687
I was your Iast hold-out,

37:49.100 --> 37:50.727
but I had to check.

37:50.801 --> 37:53.167
You didn't take the bench
until noon that day.

37:53.237 --> 37:56.798
I was in chambers.
That can be easily proved.

37:59.543 --> 38:02.808
I'm expecting a call
from the crime Iab,

38:02.880 --> 38:05.815
which, I hope to God,
proves me wrong, Walter.

38:19.163 --> 38:20.653
BENSON: Come on,
that's good enough.

38:20.731 --> 38:23.859
Hold on.
It's just going
to take another...

38:28.839 --> 38:30.329
You're done.

38:30.408 --> 38:32.808
Okay. It just needs
to dry completely.

38:33.411 --> 38:35.345
Or I could give it
the old college try.

38:35.413 --> 38:36.710
Okay, he used it
Iike a club,

38:36.781 --> 38:38.305
so why don't you
start with the neck?

38:43.921 --> 38:45.411
Oh, my God.

38:47.758 --> 38:49.817
I think it actually worked.

39:00.104 --> 39:01.162
What do you want now?

39:01.238 --> 39:03.729
Have you talked
to your husband?
Of course I have.

39:03.808 --> 39:05.639
So you know what happened.

39:05.710 --> 39:07.075
Tricia seduced him.

39:09.213 --> 39:11.078
She was 11 years old.

39:12.149 --> 39:13.980
She was a very disturbed girl.

39:14.051 --> 39:15.541
She wouldn't Ieave him alone.

39:15.619 --> 39:17.644
STABLER: And you believe him?
Yes, I do.

39:17.722 --> 39:21.123
Do you also believe
he had nothing to
do with her murder?

39:21.192 --> 39:22.921
There's no doubt in my mind.

39:22.993 --> 39:24.017
You're right.

39:25.329 --> 39:28.196
BENSON:
We found a fingerprint on
the bottle that struck Tricia.

39:28.265 --> 39:29.732
It wasn't your husband's.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.357
See?

39:31.435 --> 39:32.629
It was yours.

39:36.507 --> 39:38.031
You're wrong.

39:39.243 --> 39:43.543
When the school called,
that was the Iast straw,
wasn't it?

39:43.614 --> 39:45.241
She'd been in
so much trouble before,

39:45.316 --> 39:46.874
you had to find out
what she was up to.

39:46.951 --> 39:49.112
So you went Iooking
for her.

39:57.228 --> 40:00.755
I thought
it had to be drugs.

40:03.334 --> 40:04.961
I went and Iooked in her room.

40:05.536 --> 40:07.003
What did you find?

40:08.773 --> 40:10.570
A slip of paper
by the phone.

40:11.308 --> 40:13.776
It had a hotel,
date and time.

40:15.746 --> 40:18.146
I knew she was
going to have sex.

40:19.283 --> 40:21.342
You went there
to save her?

40:21.419 --> 40:24.013
Yes, but I was too Iate.

40:24.755 --> 40:26.313
She was just coming out.

40:28.325 --> 40:30.987
You're her mother.
You confronted her.

40:40.671 --> 40:42.605
She just walked away.

40:44.942 --> 40:46.933
I knew
she'd been with that man,

40:47.011 --> 40:48.501
the one
who got her pregnant.

40:48.579 --> 40:52.447
So you followed her,
you demanded to know.

40:54.218 --> 40:56.118
She finally told you,
didn't she?

40:58.522 --> 41:00.183
She turned on me.

41:01.392 --> 41:02.689
She said,

41:04.595 --> 41:06.961
"You want to know
who the father is?

41:08.032 --> 41:09.465
"It's your husband"'

41:11.902 --> 41:14.200
That must have
been unbearable.

41:16.841 --> 41:18.365
I slapped her.

41:20.678 --> 41:24.011
She pushed me back
and I fell.

41:26.851 --> 41:29.217
I didn't even know
there was a bottle
on the ground.

41:29.286 --> 41:30.685
I must have picked it up.

41:31.922 --> 41:34.083
You hit her
with the bottle.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.765
You know, she just...

41:44.401 --> 41:46.335
She gave me this Iook,

41:48.439 --> 41:51.408
Iike I was the one
who had betrayed her.
