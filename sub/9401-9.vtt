WEBVTT

00:00.067 --> 00:00.701
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

00:01.734 --> 00:03.033
You were at that party that night,

00:03.100 --> 00:04.901
and you got pregnant.

00:04.968 --> 00:07.033
But you didn't have sex
with Nathan Scott, did you?

00:08.434 --> 00:09.300
No.

00:10.601 --> 00:11.934
He says she's dropping everything.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.501
Maybe we need a vacation.

00:16.567 --> 00:17.534
Hmm.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.501
The Bahamas?

00:19.567 --> 00:21.400
Tree Hill.

00:21.467 --> 00:23.667
It's almost morning. I should go.

00:23.734 --> 00:26.234
Or, uh...

00:26.300 --> 00:27.334
you could stay.

00:29.167 --> 00:31.133
Administrative work is
for fatties, Millicent,

00:31.200 --> 00:33.734
and you are not a fatty.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.067
You...

00:35.133 --> 00:37.367
are a plus-size model.

00:37.434 --> 00:40.167
Honey, I'm home. Let's do this.

00:40.234 --> 00:41.634
I told you it was realistic.

00:41.701 --> 00:44.334
Hey, honey. Alex and I
worked everything out.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.267
Isn't that great?

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

01:00.500 --> 01:01.333
Hey.

01:02.801 --> 01:06.400
Uh-oh... the look,
followed by the pout.

01:06.467 --> 01:10.967
I just missed you next
to me last night... again.

01:11.034 --> 01:12.168
I know, baby.

01:12.233 --> 01:14.400
Alex and I didn't finish until 4:00 a.m.

01:14.467 --> 01:16.867
I know. I watched her
leave on my sneaky-slut cam.

01:18.534 --> 01:19.834
I'm sorry.

01:19.901 --> 01:22.168
I'm really trying to be
super-evolved girlfriend,

01:22.233 --> 01:23.400
but it's hard for me

01:23.467 --> 01:25.734
when my boyfriend
spends all of his nights

01:25.801 --> 01:28.300
writing an epic love story
with naked-actress girl.

01:28.367 --> 01:29.634
She's not naked.

01:29.701 --> 01:31.767
She's always naked in my mind.

01:31.834 --> 01:33.333
P.S.... not a good time

01:33.400 --> 01:35.333
to insert obvious
girl-on-girl humor.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.168
Hey.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.534
I love you.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.200
And I know me working with
Alex has been really hard.

01:44.267 --> 01:45.500
Excruciating.

01:45.567 --> 01:48.333
And I appreciate how
understanding you've been.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.034
But here's some good news.

01:50.101 --> 01:52.934
I think we're finally gonna
finish the script today.

01:53.001 --> 01:54.500
"Finish" as in "done"?

01:54.567 --> 01:57.001
As in "no more late nights with Alex"?

01:57.068 --> 01:58.500
And lots of late nights

01:58.567 --> 02:00.901
with the most beautiful girl I know.

02:05.233 --> 02:08.567
They're offering two
years. I say no deal.

02:08.633 --> 02:09.866
It's not bad.

02:09.934 --> 02:11.033
It's B.S.

02:11.101 --> 02:12.367
Look at your numbers last season, man.

02:12.434 --> 02:13.734
I mean,
all the team is trying to do

02:13.801 --> 02:15.333
is take advantage of the
bad press around Renee.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.767
Okay, so, right now,

02:16.834 --> 02:19.233
her lie is making my name less valuable.

02:19.300 --> 02:20.867
But not your game.

02:20.934 --> 02:22.567
That's why we're countering.

02:22.634 --> 02:25.168
I'm gonna ask for four
years. We'll take three.

02:25.233 --> 02:27.634
They offered two,
and we ask for four?

02:27.701 --> 02:29.634
It's how the game is played, Nate.

02:29.701 --> 02:32.667
You're sure they won't stop playing?

02:32.734 --> 02:35.467
Buddy, trust me.

02:35.534 --> 02:36.534
They won't.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.467
Just let me do my job.

02:38.534 --> 02:39.834
All right.

02:39.901 --> 02:41.967
It's my job to look good, bitch.

02:42.034 --> 02:45.701
Mils, you've been raping
my closet for two weeks.

02:45.767 --> 02:49.168
You should be wearing
C.O.B., not... M-E.

02:49.233 --> 02:51.168
I've been seen in all my C.O.B. clothes.

02:51.233 --> 02:52.434
What about the new stuff?

02:52.500 --> 02:54.500
That dress ball and chain
Brooke was working on

02:54.567 --> 02:55.934
would be the shiz on you.

02:56.001 --> 02:58.001
I know, but Brooke
isn't done with it yet,

02:58.068 --> 02:59.967
not to mention super
uber-assistant Calliope

03:00.034 --> 03:01.901
is guarding it like a virgin's vajayjay.

03:01.967 --> 03:04.101
And since all my old
clothes are so Millie 1.0,

03:04.168 --> 03:07.101
your closet is my only
high-rnd alternative.

03:07.168 --> 03:09.834
Oh, my God. I'm so sleepy,
and you're so talky.

03:09.901 --> 03:11.233
Sorry. Still wired.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.400
Late night, major party...
you totally missed it.

03:13.467 --> 03:14.734
Doubt it.

03:14.801 --> 03:17.333
The party scene is so lame-tarded.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.967
It's the same people,
same paparazzi, same porn.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.567
Porn?

03:22.634 --> 03:25.701
In the VIP's VIP it's way overrated.

03:27.068 --> 03:29.801
You know, I'm starting to
like just hanging with Julian

03:29.867 --> 03:31.967
and working on stuff
people take seriously

03:32.034 --> 03:34.134
other than my tight ass.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.734
O.M. Gucci!

03:39.801 --> 03:42.734
Score me some of what you've
been taking, you skinny bitch.

03:42.801 --> 03:44.801
You totally look better than me in that.

03:44.867 --> 03:45.801
Really?

03:45.867 --> 03:47.200
Take it off.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.901
Wow. That good?

03:53.300 --> 03:54.500
Hmm.

03:58.934 --> 04:00.434
Good God.

04:04.067 --> 04:05.634
Millie!

04:34.834 --> 04:36.934
"Haley James Scott,
tonight at 8:00"...

04:37.001 --> 04:39.234
And I can't even utter the last part.

04:39.301 --> 04:41.268
Free. The concert is free.

04:41.334 --> 04:44.001
One more time, and I will
wash your mouth out with soap.

04:44.067 --> 04:46.367
Please explain how
this impromptu concert

04:46.434 --> 04:48.401
is getting your album
completed on shedule.

04:48.467 --> 04:51.200
Only if you explain to me
the deal with "shedule."

04:51.267 --> 04:54.000
Come on, Miranda, I just
wanted to get out of the studio

04:54.067 --> 04:56.534
and, you know, get some
feedback on my new songs.

04:56.601 --> 04:58.534
You'll get feedback in 2 1/2 months,

04:58.601 --> 05:01.000
when the record is done and the
downloads are making the label money.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.900
And then you'll be "free" to perform

05:02.967 --> 05:05.367
at any label-authorized concert.

05:05.434 --> 05:08.701
In the meantime, this one...

05:08.768 --> 05:10.067
is off.

05:10.134 --> 05:13.434
Okay, but you're gonna
have to tell them.

05:15.401 --> 05:17.768
Go on. I'll hold the door open.

05:20.067 --> 05:22.933
Well, Americans will line
up for anything that's free.

05:26.501 --> 05:28.401
Look, we're not talking about
a rookie getting his feet wet.

05:28.467 --> 05:29.868
This is Nathan Scott.

05:29.933 --> 05:32.467
Just look at his numbers,
and I think you'll understand

05:32.534 --> 05:35.667
why we feel that he's
earned a four-year deal.

05:38.267 --> 05:39.933
Yeah.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.401
Or we might consider a three-year

05:41.467 --> 05:42.667
if the price is right,

05:42.734 --> 05:45.267
but a two is not gonna get us anywhere.

05:45.334 --> 05:46.834
I hope so.

05:48.367 --> 05:50.334
Mmm. Thanks.

05:50.401 --> 05:52.234
Best part of my day.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.033
Me or the coffee?

05:54.100 --> 05:55.634
Maybe a little bit of both.

05:57.401 --> 05:58.933
So, any good news?

05:59.000 --> 06:01.134
Uh, we'll see.
Now I just have to wait.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.267
Mm. How would you feel
about waiting with me?

06:03.334 --> 06:05.334
Come on. I have somewhere
I want to take you.

06:05.401 --> 06:07.234
Grab your office.

06:12.601 --> 06:14.768
It's good to be home.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.933
So, this is your dirty little secret?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.100
Yeah... I've been helping out here

06:34.167 --> 06:35.668
every saturday for a couple of hours.

06:35.734 --> 06:38.167
Hales and I used to do it
in high school, you know...

06:38.234 --> 06:39.867
hippie parents, raised to
give back. Hi, miss Quinn!

06:39.933 --> 06:41.234
Hi.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.800
I guess I kind of missed it.

06:44.367 --> 06:46.467
Hey, you let me in. I
just wanted to let you in.

06:46.534 --> 06:47.534
Hey, Miss Quinn.

06:47.601 --> 06:48.900
Hi.

06:48.967 --> 06:50.668
Wow.

06:50.734 --> 06:52.967
Great spiral, great listener,

06:53.034 --> 06:55.634
and now this hot Mother Teresa thing?

06:55.701 --> 06:58.634
You know, in girl world, you
just called me hot, right?

06:58.701 --> 07:00.234
In an old-nun sort of way.

07:00.301 --> 07:01.267
Oh, okay, yeah.

07:01.334 --> 07:04.101
So, what exactly do you
do here, sister Quinn?

07:04.167 --> 07:06.501
Well... we make these homemade cameras,

07:06.568 --> 07:08.800
and then we take pictures with them.

07:08.867 --> 07:11.167
You know, the first time
I looked through my lens,

07:11.234 --> 07:13.900
I realized that I could find
magic in unexpected places.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.468
And I want the kids to feel that.

07:16.534 --> 07:17.934
Pretty dorky, huh?

07:19.434 --> 07:21.067
Completely dorky, yeah.

07:23.434 --> 07:25.800
I love it.

07:25.867 --> 07:27.867
Mm. It's just a sample.

07:27.934 --> 07:30.834
It's top-secret C.O.B. for next March.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.733
I just finished it today.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.468
Here is your super-sassy
rock-star comeback outfit.

07:35.534 --> 07:37.767
I want you to look so amazing up there.

07:37.834 --> 07:40.468
I mean, you could just let me
wear this one to my show tonight.

07:40.534 --> 07:42.501
I could,
but then I'd have to kill you.

07:42.568 --> 07:44.600
And if you're dead,
we can't talk.

07:44.667 --> 07:48.667
And... I really need a huge
Haley heart-to-heart right now.

07:50.101 --> 07:51.900
All righty.

07:53.267 --> 07:54.401
Spill.

07:54.468 --> 07:56.867
I think I'm pregnant.

07:56.934 --> 07:59.934
I'm late, and I am never
late. And I'm freaking out.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.134
Why are you freaking out?

08:01.201 --> 08:02.800
You've wanted a baby since you were 22.

08:02.867 --> 08:05.534
Because I don't know how
Julian's gonna take it.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.334
The last time we
talked about our future,

08:07.401 --> 08:09.367
he basically said "what's the rush?"

08:09.434 --> 08:11.633
I am fluent in boy,
and I am pretty sure

08:11.700 --> 08:15.468
That "what's the rush?" Doesn't
mean "let's have a baby now."

08:15.534 --> 08:18.600
Maybe not, but things
happen all the time...

08:18.667 --> 08:22.434
Unexpected things that turn
out to be amazing things.

08:22.501 --> 08:24.434
I named mine Jamie.

08:24.501 --> 08:26.201
Yeah, but with all the Alex drama,

08:26.267 --> 08:29.134
I just wouldn't want him to
think that I was expecting it.

08:29.201 --> 08:31.568
Oh, Brooke, Julian's not gonna
think you got pregnant on purpose.

08:31.633 --> 08:33.301
Come on, Hales, you have to admit

08:33.366 --> 08:35.034
The timing looks a bit suspect.

08:35.101 --> 08:38.067
No. You know what?
Julian loves you.

08:38.134 --> 08:40.833
Stop worrying. Go to the doctor.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.767
It's your turn to be the girl

08:42.833 --> 08:44.767
who gets the baby and the boy.

08:44.834 --> 08:48.034
So, the girl doesn't get the boy.

08:48.101 --> 08:49.800
No.
That's what makes the ending work.

08:49.867 --> 08:51.267
She doesn't need the boy anymore.

08:51.334 --> 08:53.201
Says the boy.

08:53.267 --> 08:55.267
Not that you're the boy...
jst a boy

08:55.334 --> 08:58.067
who doesn't get that some
sad girl with bad hair

08:58.134 --> 09:00.401
doesn't want to spend money on a movie

09:00.468 --> 09:02.234
where the girl doesn't get the boy.

09:02.301 --> 09:03.667
It's not American.

09:03.733 --> 09:06.134
The ending is perfect as is.

09:06.201 --> 09:07.568
Trust me.

09:07.633 --> 09:09.267
Now, a little drumroll, please.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.900
And we're done. That's it.

09:12.967 --> 09:14.867
Fade out. Hit "print."

09:14.934 --> 09:16.867
What about all your
annoyingly good notes?

09:16.934 --> 09:18.101
You did them all.

09:18.167 --> 09:20.267
You've been so focused
these past few weeks.

09:20.334 --> 09:22.834
Now it's just time to kick
the script out of the nest,

09:22.900 --> 09:24.600
see if it can fly.

09:26.034 --> 09:28.633
My dad used to say that.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.534
So, what's next, then,
Mr. Producer?

09:30.600 --> 09:32.867
Well, I'll just put out some
feelers, make a few calls,

09:32.934 --> 09:34.934
see if anyone responds to the material.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.234
Which is, like, a no-brainer.
This script is the bomb.

09:37.301 --> 09:38.501
I'll be sure to lead with that.

09:38.568 --> 09:39.767
Good.

09:39.834 --> 09:41.733
And I'll work on scoring
production offices

09:41.800 --> 09:44.134
with expensive water and a snobby temp.

09:44.201 --> 09:45.401
We'll be so legit.

09:45.468 --> 09:46.900
Whoa.
We got to still sell the script.

09:46.967 --> 09:48.267
That could take months.

09:48.334 --> 09:51.234
So we won't be seeing each
other every day anymore?

09:51.301 --> 09:55.034
No, ma'am.
You are officially off duty.

09:55.101 --> 09:56.967
Oh.

09:57.034 --> 09:59.000
Sweet.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.134
You have no new messages.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.568
Nice shot.

10:11.633 --> 10:12.900
You got another one of those?

10:19.367 --> 10:20.867
You're good.

10:20.934 --> 10:22.600
You got an agent?

10:22.667 --> 10:24.867
Don't need your charity
today, all right?

10:27.201 --> 10:29.134
So, you staring, or you playing?

10:29.201 --> 10:31.034
Playing.

10:40.468 --> 10:41.900
Hello, Nathan.

10:47.101 --> 10:47.534
It's grandpa Dan.

10:48.733 --> 10:50.633
I saw it on the security cam.
Jamie...

10:50.700 --> 10:52.700
Grandpa Dan!

10:52.767 --> 10:53.967
Hey, there, buddy.

10:54.034 --> 10:56.034
Oh, warm welcome.

10:57.901 --> 11:01.101
Nathan, you remember my wife, Rachel.

11:01.667 --> 11:03.467
Yes.

11:03.534 --> 11:05.134
Of course.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.401
Well, when you and deb are
tired of my high-School class,

11:08.467 --> 11:09.868
I'm sure I could rummage

11:09.933 --> 11:12.267
Through some of my old
middle-School friends for you.

11:12.334 --> 11:14.534
It's good to see you, too, Nathan.

11:14.601 --> 11:17.933
It's funny... I used to
want you to be my daddy.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.334
And now I'm your mommy.

11:21.100 --> 11:23.100
Nice to meet you, grandma Rachel.

11:23.167 --> 11:24.601
Aww.

11:24.667 --> 11:27.167
I remember when you were
a rumor in third period.

11:27.234 --> 11:30.200
Dad, can I show grandpa Dan my new room?

11:33.134 --> 11:35.334
Yes. Yes, of course you can, son.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.367
I haven't seen you around here before.

11:47.434 --> 11:49.867
First time...
helping out a friend.

11:49.934 --> 11:52.201
Yeah, I saw you with the camera lady.

11:52.267 --> 11:53.534
She your girl?

11:55.601 --> 11:57.034
No.

11:57.100 --> 11:59.434
Why not? She's pretty.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.534
You got a lot of questions.

12:01.601 --> 12:03.434
My turn. You got a name?

12:03.501 --> 12:04.201
Nope.

12:10.601 --> 12:11.900
I know what you're doing...

12:11.967 --> 12:13.900
you're letting the poor kid win.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.000
That's what you all do...

12:15.067 --> 12:16.767
show up,
volunteer for a few hours,

12:16.833 --> 12:19.634
make yourselves feel
good about whatever.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.534
So, what's your thing?

12:21.601 --> 12:23.800
You a bad dad or something?

12:28.668 --> 12:31.900
I lost my wife a few years back.

12:33.267 --> 12:34.867
What was her name?

12:34.934 --> 12:36.234
Sara.

12:42.467 --> 12:44.700
My mom died, too.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.100
Do you want to talk about it?

12:50.167 --> 12:51.467
What's that gonna do?

12:53.067 --> 12:54.367
I used to think the same thing.

12:56.967 --> 12:59.534
I had a bunch of memories of her,

12:59.601 --> 13:02.367
my own secrets.

13:02.434 --> 13:04.900
And I thought that if I talked
about her with anyone else

13:04.967 --> 13:06.767
that those memories would go away.

13:06.833 --> 13:08.733
I wouldn't have our secrets anymore,

13:08.800 --> 13:10.467
and maybe I'd start to forget.

13:10.534 --> 13:13.067
And did you? Forget?

13:13.134 --> 13:15.568
Not one thing.

13:27.167 --> 13:29.534
Sometimes I feel like
she's still here with me.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.034
She is.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.034
She always will be.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.301
Moms are special that way.

13:52.634 --> 13:56.034
Brooke Davis.

13:56.100 --> 13:57.467
You ready?

13:57.534 --> 13:59.800
I've been ready.

14:03.234 --> 14:04.668
Paul Norris.

14:04.733 --> 14:06.501
Hey, dad. It's me.

14:06.568 --> 14:08.134
Julian.

14:08.201 --> 14:10.700
It's good to hear from
you, son. How are you?

14:10.767 --> 14:12.067
How's Brooke?

14:12.134 --> 14:13.800
She's good. We're good.

14:13.867 --> 14:16.267
I'm happy to hear that.

14:16.334 --> 14:17.501
So, I've been working.

14:17.568 --> 14:19.634
And I found a script that I really like.

14:19.700 --> 14:21.568
I'm thinking about sending it out.

14:21.634 --> 14:23.767
Ah. Kick it out of the nest.

14:23.833 --> 14:25.401
See if it can fly.

14:27.267 --> 14:30.367
I think you said to me about a
thousand times when I was a kid.

14:31.733 --> 14:33.867
So, dad, listen, I, um...

14:33.934 --> 14:36.800
I wanted to see if you'd
want to produce it with me.

14:36.867 --> 14:39.301
I mean, it's nothing
huge. It's an indie.

14:39.367 --> 14:42.501
But... it's about second chances.

14:42.568 --> 14:45.267
And...

14:45.334 --> 14:47.467
I don't know...
it made me think of us.

14:47.534 --> 14:50.067
I'd like that, son.

14:50.134 --> 14:51.733
Very much.

14:54.900 --> 14:57.467
This is some collection.

14:57.534 --> 14:59.668
Look at this one... Jerry Rice.

14:59.733 --> 15:00.833
Whoa!

15:00.900 --> 15:02.467
I got it for my birthday.

15:02.534 --> 15:03.867
I'm 7 now.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.267
I know.

15:06.334 --> 15:09.334
I'm sorry I missed that.

15:09.401 --> 15:12.067
I'm sorry I missed a lot of
things over this past year.

15:12.134 --> 15:14.301
I forgive you.

15:15.668 --> 15:17.867
I always hoped you were watching.

15:17.934 --> 15:20.833
I never missed it. I
pretended like you never left.

15:20.900 --> 15:24.034
I like that big clock
thing that hangs behind you,

15:24.100 --> 15:26.134
'cause it means you're okay,
even if you're still sick.

15:28.767 --> 15:30.867
I'm glad you're home again.

15:30.934 --> 15:32.900
Me too, buddy.

15:43.334 --> 15:44.668
Surprise!

15:44.733 --> 15:45.867
Rachel.

15:45.934 --> 15:47.833
Uh, what are you doing here?

15:47.900 --> 15:51.700
Waiting for a hello hug
from my favorite boy!

16:01.067 --> 16:03.668
Miss Davis.

16:06.534 --> 16:09.934
I'm... sorry, but the
test came back negative.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.267
E... excuse me?

16:12.334 --> 16:14.401
You're not pregnant.

16:24.001 --> 16:26.467
So, you and mom went to high
school with grandma Rachel?

16:27.834 --> 16:30.200
Were you friends?

16:30.267 --> 16:32.968
Um, I'm not really sure grandma
Rachel was friends with anyone.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.068
Like grandpa Dan?

16:35.133 --> 16:37.100
I'm glad they have each other.

16:38.267 --> 16:40.001
Yeah.

16:40.068 --> 16:42.867
They're a perfect match.

16:42.934 --> 16:44.701
Dad...

16:44.767 --> 16:46.801
I have a secret.

16:46.867 --> 16:49.767
Sometimes I watch grandpa Dan on tv.

16:49.834 --> 16:52.901
I know I'm not supposed to.
I'm sorry.

16:52.968 --> 16:56.233
No, Jamie, it's okay. I
knew you were watching.

16:56.300 --> 16:58.001
And it's okay for you to miss him.

16:58.068 --> 16:59.334
He loves you.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.200
He loves you, too. He
watched all the Bobcats games.

17:02.267 --> 17:03.400
And... Jamie.

17:03.467 --> 17:04.733
Dad, he's different now.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.701
He helps people, like he
helped us with that lady

17:06.767 --> 17:08.267
who was trying to hurt you and mom.

17:09.733 --> 17:11.534
Yeah.

17:11.601 --> 17:14.300
Well, there's things between
us you can't understand, Jamie.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.701
I'm not a little kid anymore.

17:17.767 --> 17:20.434
I understand a lot of things.

17:25.968 --> 17:27.300
I know you do.

17:27.367 --> 17:30.367
I wish you didn't have to.

17:30.434 --> 17:35.334
Dad, it's only three
words... "I forgive you."

17:40.334 --> 17:41.701
Shoot it.

17:43.601 --> 17:44.767
Aw!

17:46.233 --> 17:48.300
So, um...

17:48.367 --> 17:50.300
How's life in L.A.?

17:50.367 --> 17:52.034
It's great.

17:52.100 --> 17:54.167
You can be anybody you want there.

17:54.233 --> 17:56.233
And who are you?

17:56.300 --> 17:58.801
Rachel Scott...

17:58.867 --> 18:02.734
Dan's ex-screw-up of a wife
who has changed her life

18:02.801 --> 18:05.634
with the positive words of Dan Scott.

18:05.701 --> 18:07.068
It's genius.

18:07.133 --> 18:10.034
So, I guess Dan helped
you step into the light

18:10.100 --> 18:11.500
and get yourself right.

18:11.567 --> 18:12.901
Mm.

18:12.968 --> 18:14.901
Dan helped me step into the light

18:14.968 --> 18:16.901
and get myself a personal trainer,

18:16.968 --> 18:18.567
a driver, and a black card.

18:18.634 --> 18:20.701
Same Rachel, different city.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.567
So, are we gonna talk about Brooke?

18:25.634 --> 18:27.233
I mean, have you seen her?

18:27.300 --> 18:28.901
No.

18:28.968 --> 18:30.200
And I don't want to.

18:32.834 --> 18:35.701
I know I messed up last time,

18:35.767 --> 18:39.233
but she and Victoria
blackballed me in the industry.

18:39.300 --> 18:42.500
Even after I got sober,
I couldn't get a gig.

18:42.567 --> 18:46.100
Then I got unsober and ended
up shaking my ass on a pole.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.200
I'm sorry that happened to you,

18:48.267 --> 18:50.200
but none of it was Brooke's fault.

18:50.267 --> 18:52.233
So, what... you're on her side?

18:52.300 --> 18:53.767
You were her friend.

18:53.834 --> 18:55.500
She went out on a limb for you,

18:55.567 --> 18:57.534
and you repaid her by stealing money.

18:57.601 --> 18:59.233
So, yeah,
I'm kind of on her side.

19:00.701 --> 19:02.267
Go see her.

19:02.334 --> 19:04.034
You owe her that.

19:09.233 --> 19:12.801
I guess I was late because of stress.

19:12.867 --> 19:16.667
Julian, Alex, the new line...

19:16.734 --> 19:18.034
It's okay.

19:18.100 --> 19:20.100
It'll happen.

19:20.167 --> 19:22.334
When you guys are ready,
it'll happen.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.901
Brooke.

19:23.968 --> 19:25.701
Hey.

19:25.767 --> 19:28.534
You were so meant to be a mom.

19:28.601 --> 19:31.133
You are gonna have a houseful

19:31.200 --> 19:34.068
of very fashionably dressed
little Brooke Davises

19:34.133 --> 19:36.267
running around.

19:36.334 --> 19:38.367
You wait and see.

19:39.601 --> 19:41.300
Yeah.

19:48.834 --> 19:50.434
So, this is your cave?

19:50.500 --> 19:52.534
Yeah, we can't all have
pimped-out beach houses

19:52.601 --> 19:54.068
to hide in.

19:54.133 --> 19:57.500
Says the woman whose cave is
in an nba player's mansion.

19:57.567 --> 19:59.467
TouchÃ©.

19:59.534 --> 20:01.467
But I'm thinking about getting back

20:01.534 --> 20:03.167
to my artist roots, you know?

20:03.233 --> 20:06.267
Crampy, old apartments with
character and creaky floors...

20:06.334 --> 20:08.001
they make the best caves.

20:08.068 --> 20:10.068
So you're staying in Tree Hill?

20:10.133 --> 20:11.767
For a while.

20:11.834 --> 20:14.300
You know, it's home.
I like it here.

20:14.367 --> 20:17.133
Plus, you know, the
company isn't horrible.

20:20.034 --> 20:21.400
Beautiful.

20:21.467 --> 20:22.367
It is.

20:22.434 --> 20:24.068
This is what I love...

20:24.133 --> 20:26.300
you know,
standing in the pitch black,

20:26.367 --> 20:28.167
waiting for the smallest moment

20:28.233 --> 20:30.334
to reveal itself right before your eyes.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.834
I have to take this.

20:37.901 --> 20:40.500
I... hope it's what I want to hear.

20:40.567 --> 20:42.534
Oh, you're super agent.
It will be.

20:44.068 --> 20:45.367
Hey.

20:46.834 --> 20:48.267
Today?

20:48.334 --> 20:50.068
Are we sure?

20:50.133 --> 20:53.034
Yeah, that's great.
Just keep me posted.

20:53.100 --> 20:54.300
Good news?

20:54.367 --> 20:57.734
Just a rumor, but, uh, yeah,
I think so.

20:59.367 --> 21:00.767
So, I should get going.

21:00.834 --> 21:02.734
Yeah.

21:02.801 --> 21:04.834
But I'll see you tonight
at Haley's concert?

21:04.901 --> 21:06.034
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

21:06.100 --> 21:07.133
Okay.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.968
Oh.

21:11.034 --> 21:12.968
We're not working tonight, Alex.

21:13.034 --> 21:14.667
I know,
but I just reread the script,

21:14.734 --> 21:16.068
and it totally sucks ducks.

21:16.133 --> 21:18.500
I mean, the main character
is total white noise.

21:18.567 --> 21:21.534
She needs, like, a... a crack habit
or a... a brother with cancer...

21:21.601 --> 21:22.934
something oscar-worthy.

21:23.001 --> 21:24.434
The script is awesome.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.834
Trust yourself. We did good work.

21:25.901 --> 21:27.701
But I... I just...
Good night, Alex.

21:27.767 --> 21:29.200
I have plans with Brooke.

21:29.267 --> 21:31.001
But...

21:32.934 --> 21:34.767
I'm just...

21:34.834 --> 21:36.834
never really good at being alone.

21:36.901 --> 21:38.734
Come on. Stop it.
Go live your life.

21:38.801 --> 21:40.534
You're Alex DuprÃ©.

21:51.601 --> 21:53.601
Well, well. This is
quite the crowd, isn't it?

21:53.667 --> 21:55.601
Yeah, I can't believe
all these people showed up

21:55.667 --> 21:56.968
after so many years.

21:57.034 --> 21:58.267
I know.

21:58.334 --> 22:01.167
There is a lot of people
out there... just waiting.

22:01.233 --> 22:02.634
Wow.

22:02.701 --> 22:04.500
So... nervous?

22:04.567 --> 22:06.434
'Cause I heard you get
a bit of stage fright.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.200
Oh, no. Actually, I'm
not nervous at all.

22:08.267 --> 22:10.367
I'm just looking forward
to getting back out there.

22:10.434 --> 22:12.068
Really? Because I'd be nervous.

22:12.133 --> 22:14.300
I mean, after all, if
the music's no good,

22:14.367 --> 22:16.467
it'll be all over Youtube by tomorrow.

22:16.534 --> 22:18.667
And then you'll have to explain
to the label what you were thinking

22:18.734 --> 22:21.567
when you put together this
premature little free concert

22:21.634 --> 22:24.001
that could ruin any good buzz we
have about your up-and-coming album.

22:24.068 --> 22:26.068
Ohh.

22:26.133 --> 22:27.167
See? Now I'm nervous.

22:28.734 --> 22:30.634
Break a leg.

22:30.701 --> 22:33.667
That's funny... "leg" wasn't
my first option for you.

22:39.068 --> 22:42.001
Live your life, Alex.

22:47.334 --> 22:48.267
Mm.

22:48.334 --> 22:49.867
Can I get another?

22:52.001 --> 22:53.067
Hey, baby.

22:53.134 --> 22:54.867
Hi.

22:54.934 --> 22:56.767
I hope that's champagne
you just ordered,

22:56.834 --> 22:58.834
'cause we're celebrating
tonight, remember?

22:58.900 --> 23:01.334
Right... we're celebrating.

23:04.667 --> 23:05.900
I'll be right back.

23:14.834 --> 23:16.633
I told you I'm with Brooke tonight.

23:16.700 --> 23:18.533
No games, Alex.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.301
This isn't a game. I swear.

23:21.368 --> 23:24.067
I found some coke in my suitcase.

23:24.134 --> 23:26.234
What have you done?

23:26.301 --> 23:28.667
Nothing... yet.

23:28.734 --> 23:31.600
But I'm thinking about it.

23:31.667 --> 23:33.633
I don't want to mess up.

23:33.700 --> 23:35.900
Okay, look, calm down.

23:35.967 --> 23:37.934
Please come.

23:38.001 --> 23:39.767
Please.

23:41.734 --> 23:45.134
Okay, just don't do
anything. I'm on my way, okay?

23:51.867 --> 23:53.567
Okay.

23:56.834 --> 23:58.368
What's up, bud? Hey.

23:58.434 --> 24:00.667
I hope that grin means you
had a good day at the office.

24:00.734 --> 24:02.434
I'm hearing good things.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.201
That's awesome.

24:04.267 --> 24:06.234
I don't think I could take
any more bad news today.

24:06.301 --> 24:08.001
What's up?

24:08.067 --> 24:09.401
You okay?

24:09.468 --> 24:12.234
Yeah, I'm fine. It's
just... it's family stuff.

24:12.301 --> 24:13.401
All right.

24:13.468 --> 24:16.034
Chase, my man,
I'm in a good mood.

24:16.101 --> 24:19.633
So I'm gonna have one of those
tasty blue brain blasters.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.567
You could have told me they sucked.

24:21.633 --> 24:23.368
Come on. Who said that?

24:23.434 --> 24:25.201
They sucked, and you know it.

24:25.267 --> 24:28.500
And that's why, from now on,
I'm officially just bar manager.

24:28.567 --> 24:31.600
But who's gonna bring
me my shots and beers?

24:31.667 --> 24:34.101
All right. Hey, Grubbs.

24:34.167 --> 24:37.967
Guys, this is Grubbs,
my new bartender.

24:38.034 --> 24:39.600
Clay here wants a drink.

24:39.667 --> 24:41.201
What do you think?

24:41.267 --> 24:44.301
Shot of tequila, chilled,
and a beer, imported.

24:44.368 --> 24:46.734
No... hip domestic.

24:47.867 --> 24:49.468
Nice.

24:49.533 --> 24:51.368
Wow. That's pretty impressive.

24:51.434 --> 24:53.767
Yeah, I know. That guy sucks.

24:57.500 --> 24:58.468
Here.

24:58.533 --> 24:59.867
Thanks, Grubbs.

24:59.934 --> 25:02.334
Well... to you.

25:02.401 --> 25:04.067
Thanks for all the hard work.

25:04.134 --> 25:06.800
And here's to next season
not being a contract year.

25:06.867 --> 25:07.800
Congrats, man.

25:07.867 --> 25:09.734
Cheers.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.267
Hey, Nate. Hey.

25:13.334 --> 25:15.533
Clay. Hey, Quinn.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.234
Oh, hey, check this out.

25:17.301 --> 25:19.800
Grubbs, this is Quinn.

25:19.867 --> 25:20.834
Hey.

25:20.900 --> 25:21.967
She needs a drink.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.468
White wine's gonna make you both happy.

25:27.767 --> 25:30.301
Wow. He's better than Zelda.

25:37.700 --> 25:40.500
Hey! Oh, my gosh!

25:40.567 --> 25:42.600
I've been gone a long time.

25:42.667 --> 25:45.201
But, uh, I'm back. It feels good.

25:45.267 --> 25:48.301
Anyway, I want to show you
guys some of my new songs.

25:48.368 --> 25:50.301
And, uh... thanks for showing up.

25:50.368 --> 25:51.967
I hope you like it.

27:00.468 --> 27:03.700
What do you mean you're on
your way to Alex's hotel room?

27:03.767 --> 27:05.567
Brooke, I'm sorry.
She's in trouble.

27:05.633 --> 27:07.234
And of course she called you.

27:07.301 --> 27:08.834
Well, I didn't really have a choice.

27:08.900 --> 27:10.267
She said she found some cocaine

27:10.334 --> 27:11.667
and she thinks she may relapse.

27:11.734 --> 27:14.001
I... I can't just leave her alone.

27:14.067 --> 27:15.500
She sounded really bad.

27:15.567 --> 27:18.267
She's an actress, Julian!

27:18.334 --> 27:19.867
I'll hurry back. I promise.

27:38.967 --> 27:40.001
Boo!

27:40.067 --> 27:41.201
Hey. Where have you been?

27:41.267 --> 27:42.533
I called, but you didn't answer.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.001
I know. Sorry. I had to
drop by work for a sec.

27:44.067 --> 27:45.468
You like?

27:45.533 --> 27:48.134
You look great. But
you always looks great.

27:48.201 --> 27:50.001
You always say that, Mouth.

27:50.067 --> 27:52.201
You called me "Mouth."

27:52.267 --> 27:54.234
You never call me "Mouth."

28:17.201 --> 28:19.034
What the hell are you wearing?

28:19.101 --> 28:21.401
It's great, Brooke. I love it.

28:21.468 --> 28:24.167
You know that dress is not supposed
to be released until next summer,

28:24.234 --> 28:26.134
so unless I magically
went to sleep for a year,

28:26.201 --> 28:28.401
you need to explain to me
why you're wearing it tonight.

28:28.468 --> 28:32.167
I thought it would be fine.
I mean, I'm the face of C.O.B.

28:32.234 --> 28:34.201
Millicent Huxtable,

28:34.267 --> 28:36.867
that dress needs to
leave this bar right now,

28:36.934 --> 28:38.700
on or off you.

28:38.767 --> 28:41.533
Your choice or your job.

28:41.600 --> 28:44.234
Someone needs to chill out.

28:44.301 --> 28:45.500
It's just a dress.

28:45.567 --> 28:47.267
And there's no one
important in here, anyway.

28:47.334 --> 28:49.934
"No one important"? What's
that supposed to mean?

28:50.001 --> 28:53.234
I mean, it's Tric,
not the Music Awards.

28:53.301 --> 28:55.633
Is that why you're taking pills...

28:55.700 --> 28:57.334
so you can go look fab

28:57.401 --> 28:59.734
at someplace important,
like the Music Awards?

28:59.800 --> 29:01.101
You were going through my stuff?

29:01.167 --> 29:02.567
Your stuff was all over the room.

29:02.633 --> 29:04.067
And that's not what's important here.

29:04.134 --> 29:05.234
I'm worried about you.

29:05.301 --> 29:06.567
Worried about what?

29:06.633 --> 29:07.834
You're different...

29:07.900 --> 29:09.567
Blowing Brooke off,
messing up at work,

29:09.633 --> 29:11.633
partying all the time,
and now these pills.

29:11.700 --> 29:15.533
So I took a few diet
pills to drop a few pounds.

29:15.600 --> 29:16.667
So what?

29:16.734 --> 29:18.800
Brooke hired you for who you are.

29:18.867 --> 29:20.800
You don't have to change that.

29:20.867 --> 29:22.734
I don't just have to please Brooke.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.201
There's an entire industry.

29:24.267 --> 29:26.034
It's a lot of pressure to fit in.

29:26.101 --> 29:27.567
And for once, I want to fit in.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.734
God, marvin, you told
me you supported me.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.267
I wanted you to be a model

29:31.334 --> 29:33.134
because it made you feel special.

29:33.201 --> 29:35.900
And that's sweet and noble

29:35.967 --> 29:38.368
and one of the reasons why I love you.

29:38.434 --> 29:40.234
But it's not that simple.

29:40.301 --> 29:42.867
I wish it were, but it's not.

29:49.234 --> 29:50.600
I'm sorry.

29:50.667 --> 29:52.834
Stop saying you're sorry.

29:52.900 --> 29:54.934
You're just the only one I could call

29:55.001 --> 29:56.800
who wouldn't want to do it with me

29:56.867 --> 29:58.533
or report it to the tabloids.

29:58.600 --> 30:01.134
What about your sponsor from rehab?

30:01.201 --> 30:03.001
Rehab was for publicity.

30:03.067 --> 30:05.734
My sponsor isn't good for anything

30:05.800 --> 30:07.700
besides scoring the best blow.

30:09.034 --> 30:11.001
The only time I stopped doing it

30:11.067 --> 30:13.001
was when I started working with you.

30:14.434 --> 30:16.700
I'm not trying to pressure you.

30:16.767 --> 30:19.500
It's just the truth.

30:19.567 --> 30:21.567
Well, I'll take it and go.

30:21.633 --> 30:24.334
But I could just go out and get more.

30:24.401 --> 30:25.301
Would you?

30:25.368 --> 30:27.633
I don't know.

30:30.700 --> 30:33.934
Right now, I want it so bad.

30:37.533 --> 30:39.967
Tonight was hard.

30:40.034 --> 30:43.101
I didn't have anywhere to go.

30:44.934 --> 30:47.334
It was so quiet in here.

30:50.034 --> 30:52.034
And I hate myself when it's quiet.

30:52.101 --> 30:54.667
Hey. Alex.

30:54.734 --> 30:55.800
Hey.

30:57.533 --> 31:00.567
You are so much more than you see.

31:00.633 --> 31:03.934
The girl I've been working
with is bright and funny

31:04.001 --> 31:06.134
and independent and
strong all by herself.

31:06.201 --> 31:08.001
She doesn't need that stuff.

31:10.167 --> 31:12.734
I wish I could see her.

31:16.834 --> 31:20.967
Let's just get you through tonight...

31:21.034 --> 31:23.567
and hopefully you will.

31:29.500 --> 31:32.067
The playbaounds great.

31:32.134 --> 31:33.633
Playback?
I recorded a little bit.

31:33.700 --> 31:35.867
You know, I thought we could
"accidentally" leak a song,

31:35.934 --> 31:37.301
get the fans excited for more.

31:37.368 --> 31:40.301
This little concert was genius.

31:40.368 --> 31:42.434
I'm so glad I thought of it.

31:42.500 --> 31:43.600
Yeah, me too.

31:43.667 --> 31:45.034
Studio tomorrow,
bright and early.

31:45.101 --> 31:46.368
Where are you headed?

31:46.434 --> 31:48.134
Have you met Grubbs,
the bartender?

31:48.201 --> 31:50.234
He's kind of hot, in a...

31:50.301 --> 31:52.934
dirty, "I'm gonna hate myself
in the morning" sort of way.

31:53.001 --> 31:55.067
Ciao.

31:57.001 --> 31:58.934
Hi. Oh, thank you.

31:59.001 --> 32:01.001
You know, I could get
used to being the one

32:01.067 --> 32:02.368
watching from the stands.

32:02.434 --> 32:04.500
No, it's my job.
I'm not giving it up.

32:04.567 --> 32:06.167
Oh. You were amazing, Hales.

32:06.234 --> 32:07.867
Thank you.

32:07.934 --> 32:10.600
When I was up there, I couldn't
stop thinking about how lucky we are

32:10.667 --> 32:12.401
and how we just got
everything we dreamed of...

32:12.468 --> 32:15.067
Jamie and how far we've come,

32:15.134 --> 32:17.967
and it just feels like nothing
can get in the way of that anymore.

32:18.034 --> 32:20.334
Why do we say things like that?

32:20.401 --> 32:22.134
What?

32:22.201 --> 32:25.201
Well, I didn't want to tell
you this before the show, but...

32:30.201 --> 32:34.700
he is the healthiest-looking
dying man I have ever seen.

32:35.934 --> 32:38.434
I guess evil does a body good.

32:45.633 --> 32:48.500
It's everything I took
from you... plus interest.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.633
Well.

32:50.700 --> 32:53.800
Not that I have anything to say

32:53.867 --> 32:55.700
to your thieving ass,

32:55.767 --> 32:59.234
but you took a lot
more than money, Rachel.

32:59.301 --> 33:01.800
And I'm trying to take
responsibility for that, Brooke.

33:01.867 --> 33:03.301
You should, too.

33:03.368 --> 33:06.500
I'm sorry. Is that hair
color seeping into your brain?

33:06.567 --> 33:10.533
What in your twisted, little
head am I responsible for?

33:10.600 --> 33:12.700
You left a envelope full
of money with a junkie.

33:12.767 --> 33:14.567
Says the junkie.

33:14.633 --> 33:16.434
True forgiveness is about

33:16.500 --> 33:18.834
accepting our own fault in things.

33:18.900 --> 33:20.934
You'd know that if you watched the show.

33:22.301 --> 33:25.167
Now, I have given you
an apology and a check,

33:25.234 --> 33:27.234
and you've given me nothing.

33:27.301 --> 33:29.101
But that's okay. I forgive...

33:30.101 --> 33:32.734
Stay away from me, bitch.

33:44.267 --> 33:45.633
Whiskey... straight up.

33:45.700 --> 33:46.800
Hmm.

33:46.867 --> 33:48.001
I'd have guessed blood.

33:50.667 --> 33:52.500
Interesting choice for the poster boy

33:52.567 --> 33:54.001
of redemption and clean living.

34:00.767 --> 34:04.267
I know I surprised you today.

34:04.334 --> 34:05.734
I'm sorry about that.

34:07.334 --> 34:10.167
You're always sorry, Dan.

34:10.234 --> 34:12.934
So, why are you back?
What do you want?

34:13.001 --> 34:14.234
A chance.

34:16.368 --> 34:18.400
It's not gonna happen, Dan.

34:19.434 --> 34:20.800
And I'm kind of thinking

34:20.867 --> 34:23.600
you should cancel your
plane ride to ask Lucas, too.

34:27.067 --> 34:29.600
You know, I'd hoped fixing
things between you and Renee

34:29.667 --> 34:32.001
would help thaw the ice a bit.

34:32.067 --> 34:33.967
So you did that for yourself.

34:34.034 --> 34:35.734
No.

34:35.800 --> 34:37.301
I did it for you.

34:40.266 --> 34:42.632
Well, I already said "thank you."

34:44.034 --> 34:45.400
You know...

34:45.467 --> 34:49.266
there's never gonna be a
golden ticket back into my life.

34:49.333 --> 34:51.467
I'll tolerate you for Jamie.

34:51.533 --> 34:52.900
But you're dead to me.

34:54.533 --> 34:57.134
The moment Keith died, you died.

35:14.067 --> 35:15.900
It's like watching an antelope

35:15.967 --> 35:18.533
at the watering hole in the Serengeti.

35:18.600 --> 35:21.867
This antelope hasn't hooked up
at the watering hole in weeks.

35:21.934 --> 35:24.134
There's a nun that's
been hogging all my time.

35:24.201 --> 35:27.034
Oh, excuse me. I guess I've
been messing up your game.

35:27.101 --> 35:31.633
Eh, it's okay.
The game was getting old.

35:35.201 --> 35:37.767
I thank you for today.

35:37.834 --> 35:40.034
I'm glad that you got
me out of the house.

35:40.101 --> 35:41.800
Those kids were good for me.

35:41.867 --> 35:43.101
Yeah.

35:43.167 --> 35:45.667
I know, right?

35:45.734 --> 35:49.101
It's all about finding
magic in unexpected places.

35:50.234 --> 35:51.567
Yeah.

35:53.267 --> 35:55.167
So, did you get that
call you were waiting on?

35:55.234 --> 35:57.134
Not yet.

35:57.201 --> 35:59.368
But, you know, I've done
a lot of deals like this.

35:59.434 --> 36:00.967
Silence is just one of their tools.

36:01.034 --> 36:02.334
It'll work out.

36:02.401 --> 36:03.600
I hope so.

36:03.667 --> 36:05.001
Yeah.

36:05.067 --> 36:06.500
Well, I should get going.

36:06.567 --> 36:08.900
I have to be up early and bring
coffee to this friend of mine.

36:08.967 --> 36:10.267
He kind of depends on me.

36:11.900 --> 36:14.001
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:14.067 --> 36:15.633
Quinn.

36:18.201 --> 36:20.468
Who says tonight's over?

36:24.867 --> 36:27.167
I just thought you'd be home by now.

36:27.234 --> 36:29.834
Look, me too,
but she's all alone.

36:29.900 --> 36:31.434
So am I.

36:31.500 --> 36:34.767
Brooke, you know I love you.

36:34.834 --> 36:36.767
I just don't think I
should leave her yet.

36:36.834 --> 36:39.067
She's...

36:39.134 --> 36:40.767
I'm worried about her.

36:40.834 --> 36:43.201
Well, I'm worried about us.

36:43.267 --> 36:45.067
But you do what you've got to do.

37:07.301 --> 37:10.967
I was stupid to think
he'd let me back in.

37:11.034 --> 37:12.533
Baby, let's go back to L.A.

37:12.600 --> 37:16.167
Let's leave these small
people and this small town.

37:17.834 --> 37:20.834
This small town's the
closest thing we have to home.

37:20.900 --> 37:22.600
And I'm not running from it anymore.

37:22.667 --> 37:23.800
Neither should you.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.667
Who says I'm running?

37:25.734 --> 37:27.900
You are.

37:27.967 --> 37:29.301
We both are.

37:31.101 --> 37:34.600
And I'm not leaving until
I get what I came for.

37:34.667 --> 37:36.800
What's that, Dan?

37:36.867 --> 37:39.034
Redemption.

37:45.967 --> 37:47.734
Come on.
You totally can't see it?

37:47.800 --> 37:49.067
Look closer.

37:49.134 --> 37:51.201
I swear that there's a face on the moon.

37:51.267 --> 37:52.900
Oh, yeah. Look at that. It...

37:52.967 --> 37:54.800
Wow.
It's entirely made of cheese, too.

37:54.867 --> 37:56.800
Oh, yeah, and you totally suck.

37:56.867 --> 37:59.533
And you totally crack me up.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.301
And I... I haven't laughed
so hard in a long time.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.600
You want to go for a swim?

38:14.201 --> 38:17.034
Says the man that knows
I'm afraid of the water.

38:17.101 --> 38:18.867
What if I'm afraid, too?

38:21.600 --> 38:23.967
Okay, I'll play.

38:24.034 --> 38:25.967
What are you afraid of?

38:27.500 --> 38:29.567
To move on.

38:29.633 --> 38:32.468
And to feel something for someone now.

38:34.934 --> 38:36.734
But I'm tired of being afraid.
I...

38:47.867 --> 38:49.633
There are so many reasons

38:49.700 --> 38:51.734
that I shouldn't have done that.

38:53.468 --> 38:55.500
But I've wanted to for so long.

38:56.900 --> 38:58.334
Me too.

39:14.334 --> 39:16.101
You can do it, Alex.

39:17.934 --> 39:19.667
I know.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.368
Wait.

39:26.434 --> 39:28.468
I don't understand.

39:34.500 --> 39:35.967
I do.

39:36.034 --> 39:37.800
You've been lying all night.

39:37.867 --> 39:39.800
Nice performance, Alex.

39:39.867 --> 39:41.533
No, I wasn't lying. I swear.

39:41.600 --> 39:42.700
Julian, please.

39:42.767 --> 39:45.267
It was full.

40:01.034 --> 40:02.900
Why can't you be the girl

40:02.967 --> 40:07.567
who gets the boy and
the baby, Brooke Davis?

40:29.500 --> 40:31.800
Hey.

40:31.867 --> 40:34.468
You know that this thing with Dan...

40:34.533 --> 40:36.134
It's gonna be okay, right?

40:36.201 --> 40:38.201
He can't hurt us anymore.

40:38.267 --> 40:40.267
Yeah, I know.

40:40.334 --> 40:41.667
Good.

40:43.334 --> 40:46.734
So, how about a little
special encore performance

40:46.800 --> 40:48.301
for my sexy-ass husband?

40:48.368 --> 40:49.967
Yeah?

40:50.034 --> 40:51.767
Big news in the nba...
The Charlotte Bobcats

40:51.834 --> 40:53.600
have opened up their checkbook
and capped themselves out,

40:53.667 --> 40:57.134
acquiring Derek McDaniel in
a hush-hush deal late today.

40:57.201 --> 40:59.201
That's bad news for
local star Nathan Scott,

40:59.267 --> 41:02.301
who is going to have to find
a spot elsewhere, if at all.
