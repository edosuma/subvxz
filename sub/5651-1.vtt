WEBVTT

00:54.750 --> 00:55.707
You.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.951
Holy shit.

01:25.824 --> 01:27.783
Who am I?

01:34.920 --> 01:36.531
[groaning]

01:39.577 --> 01:41.710
Jesus Christ.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.908
"Remember"?

02:09.520 --> 02:11.827
Remember, uh...

02:17.833 --> 02:19.704
Shit! Remember nothing.

02:19.748 --> 02:21.358
What is going on?! Fuck!

02:21.402 --> 02:23.317
Who am I?! Fuck!

02:23.360 --> 02:25.275
[distant door closes]

02:25.319 --> 02:28.496
[amnesiac]
Hello?

02:28.539 --> 02:31.499
Hello?

02:31.542 --> 02:35.155
Hey, could--is anyone there?
Can you help me?

02:44.381 --> 02:46.383
[loud bang]

02:46.427 --> 02:47.863
[panting]

03:05.881 --> 03:07.535
[sniffles]

03:13.758 --> 03:14.759
[bucket clatters]

03:14.803 --> 03:16.718
Oh.

03:18.807 --> 03:20.243
[groans]

03:27.772 --> 03:30.253
[chuckles]

03:30.297 --> 03:32.429
I'm going crazy, man.

03:32.473 --> 03:33.909
[boy]
Well, we have 63 days.

03:33.952 --> 03:35.563
How do you expect me
to survive

03:35.606 --> 03:37.042
without cell phone
or Internet access?

03:37.086 --> 03:39.044
Get over it! Dang!

03:39.088 --> 03:41.046
We're young.
It's summer camp.

03:41.090 --> 03:43.397
[amnesiac]
Who's that?

03:47.705 --> 03:50.578
Adam Goldstein?

04:11.642 --> 04:13.253
[distant thump]

04:24.960 --> 04:27.354
OK, what do I know?

04:28.964 --> 04:30.487
I'm Adam.

04:31.793 --> 04:33.577
[sighs]

04:33.621 --> 04:34.970
What else do I know?

04:35.013 --> 04:36.711
What is going on?

04:36.754 --> 04:38.452
What's going on?!

04:58.515 --> 05:00.517
[flies buzzing]

05:08.699 --> 05:10.527
[woman] Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

05:10.571 --> 05:12.355
I'm a United States
citizen.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.357
Your actions here
could turn a cold war

05:14.401 --> 05:16.620
into a nuclear
fucking holocaust!

05:16.664 --> 05:19.580
You have absolutely no fucking
idea what I'm saying, do you?

05:19.623 --> 05:22.017
[Russian accent]
You are spy, right?

05:22.060 --> 05:24.454
So now you help
Mother Russia.

05:24.498 --> 05:26.108
[woman screams]

05:26.151 --> 05:29.067
[speaks Russian]

05:38.163 --> 05:39.817
Um, OK.

05:39.861 --> 05:40.992
Wow, I'm Russian?

05:41.036 --> 05:42.472
Russia, Russia, Russia.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.822
I'm a Russian teenage scientist

05:44.866 --> 05:47.347
from the Cold War
who doesn't age, apparently.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.350
Probably not.

05:52.917 --> 05:54.876
[sighs]

05:57.182 --> 05:59.141
[door creaks]

06:14.765 --> 06:17.725
[Adam] I like to come here
and get away sometimes.

06:17.768 --> 06:20.423
You know, it's just--
it's quiet, peaceful.

06:20.467 --> 06:23.513
Wow. This place is
amazing at night.

06:23.557 --> 06:26.168
Yeah, you know, it's--
it's cool to think here,

06:26.211 --> 06:28.736
let the stillness
of the water relax you.

06:28.779 --> 06:31.173
-Like meditation?
-Like meditation?

06:31.216 --> 06:32.696
[Adam]
Yeah, like that.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.481
Like that.

06:34.524 --> 06:37.440
I'm--I'm really starting
to feel something for you.

06:37.484 --> 06:41.052
Is that--is that weird,
that I feel very connected?

06:41.096 --> 06:42.053
No.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.577
It's not bad at all.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.758
Ohh.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.938
Jess, I just don't want
to hurt anyone.

06:57.982 --> 07:00.594
[Adam sighs]

07:00.637 --> 07:02.117
Right.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.515
Must be an asshole.

07:09.864 --> 07:12.606
Oh, Jesus,
what happened to you?

07:14.216 --> 07:17.132
Looks like we're
in this together.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.658
What do you say?

07:21.702 --> 07:23.660
My bad.

07:23.704 --> 07:26.489
There you go.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.143
Fuck.

07:31.538 --> 07:32.974
I hear you're still
having those stupid,

07:33.017 --> 07:34.671
nasty seizures.

07:34.715 --> 07:37.195
Are they scary?

07:37.239 --> 07:39.894
How old are you?

07:39.937 --> 07:41.896
-I'm 7 3/4.
-[gasps]

07:41.939 --> 07:43.593
You're older
than my daughter.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.595
She's only 7 1/2.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.597
I'm going to go talk
to your parents

07:47.641 --> 07:49.599
about a procedure
I'd like to try.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.122
It's nothing bad.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.298
It's called multiple
subpial transections,

07:53.342 --> 07:55.953
which is a lot
of big words to describe

07:55.997 --> 07:58.565
very tiny cuts that you
won't feel at all.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.567
[equipment beeping]

08:00.610 --> 08:03.744
Kayla, count backwards from ten
for me. Clean here, please.

08:03.787 --> 08:05.267
-10...
-[nurse] Yes, Doctor.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.269
[Kayla]
9, 8, 7...

08:07.312 --> 08:09.793
[doctor] Looks good. Thanks.
Making a 5-millimeter incision.

08:09.837 --> 08:12.753
-[Kayla] 6...
-[prolonged beep]

08:12.796 --> 08:14.015
No! No!

08:14.058 --> 08:15.582
[Kayla] W to the power of I...

08:15.625 --> 08:17.061
[nurse] We're losing
a lot of blood.

08:17.105 --> 08:20.064
...derivative over N
to the power of I

08:20.108 --> 08:22.589
minus A Z to
the power of...

08:22.632 --> 08:23.590
[prolonged beep]

08:23.633 --> 08:25.069
No.

08:25.113 --> 08:27.507
No, no. No!

08:34.034 --> 08:35.253
Shit.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.996
OK.
[sniffs]

08:39.039 --> 08:40.258
[sighs]

08:45.350 --> 08:47.265
Uh...

09:16.991 --> 09:18.949
...very special day,
and frankly,

09:18.993 --> 09:21.952
I don't care to hear anymore
about the sick need

09:21.996 --> 09:23.954
you have to update
your Facebook status.

09:23.998 --> 09:26.653
-Special day?
-Tyrannical reign

09:26.696 --> 09:28.829
of these little bastards
is coming to an end.

09:28.872 --> 09:31.788
This is the time that
the people at the bottom,

09:31.832 --> 09:34.965
we rise up and we take down
the powers that be.

09:35.009 --> 09:36.271
And who are
the powers that be?

09:36.314 --> 09:37.968
Spoiled little
shit bags.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.666
We have no authority
over these kids.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.624
They know that every
disciplinary action

09:41.668 --> 09:43.670
we take is merely
a suggestion

09:43.713 --> 09:45.410
because they make
one little phone call

09:45.454 --> 09:47.325
to their rich little daddies,
and all of a sudden,

09:47.369 --> 09:49.980
Little Billy doesn't have
to make his own bed anymore.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.286
I got to make
his own bed,

09:51.329 --> 09:52.853
with these hands.

09:52.896 --> 09:55.290
-So this is about Billy?
-Fuck Billy! No!

09:55.333 --> 09:56.987
Well, yeah,

09:57.031 --> 09:59.686
but it's not just
about Little Billy.

09:59.729 --> 10:02.036
It's about all
the Little Billies.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.081
Stop calling them
Little Billies.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.996
Fuck! What's his name,
the kid who shit himself?

10:06.040 --> 10:08.303
Don't talk
about Puraj.

10:08.346 --> 10:09.826
Yeah, Puraj,
the Puerto Rican kid.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.132
He's Indian!

10:11.175 --> 10:12.655
[man] You're missing my point.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.091
What's your point?

10:14.135 --> 10:16.311
We're gonna
butt-fuck these kids.

10:16.354 --> 10:17.660
Wow.

10:17.704 --> 10:20.097
[Jess] Who are you butt-fucking?

10:20.141 --> 10:22.099
No one, Jess.

10:22.143 --> 10:23.927
It's all good.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.189
Mm-hmm.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.669
You look really sweet.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.018
Good.

10:28.062 --> 10:30.281
I love her.

10:30.325 --> 10:33.415
I can't believe she's
my fucking girlfriend.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.286
It's forever.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.940
Yeah, well,

10:36.984 --> 10:39.421
it's just a water fight,
so...calm down.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.728
Butt fuck!

10:43.817 --> 10:45.949
[Adam's friend on P.A.]
Good morning, campers.

10:45.993 --> 10:47.777
I hope you have
your running shoes on today,

10:47.821 --> 10:49.300
'cause I'm fucking
coming for you,

10:49.344 --> 10:51.302
you little shits!

11:09.277 --> 11:10.974
Yeah, see?
There he his.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.367
You're finally living
a little, instead of

11:12.410 --> 11:14.717
that emo,
brooding bullshit.

11:14.761 --> 11:15.849
You want to jerk each other off?

11:15.892 --> 11:17.067
-What?
-Just touch it.

11:17.111 --> 11:19.330
What the fuck? Get outta here.

11:19.374 --> 11:21.332
[Adam]
Aah! Aah!

11:21.376 --> 11:24.031
[kids yelling]

11:24.074 --> 11:26.903
Yeah, I'm your
worst nightmare!

11:26.947 --> 11:28.252
[Adam]
Clark, Clark.

11:28.296 --> 11:29.732
-Oh, my God.
-Clark, dude.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.255
You're the big dog.
Ha ha!

11:31.299 --> 11:33.170
OK, uh,

11:33.214 --> 11:35.738
look, there's something
I have to tell you, Clark.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.044
[Clark]
Little Billy.

11:37.087 --> 11:39.046
I want him dead.

11:41.526 --> 11:42.963
[both grunt]

11:43.006 --> 11:44.965
[laughs and groans]

11:45.008 --> 11:46.793
Ha ha!

11:46.836 --> 11:48.142
-Ohh.
-Oh, my God.

11:48.185 --> 11:50.144
[Adam]
You OK?

11:50.187 --> 11:52.146
Yeah, I think.

11:52.189 --> 11:54.148
Oh.

11:54.191 --> 11:58.021
Yeah, I...I think so.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.899
Remember?

12:08.292 --> 12:10.164
Goddamn it,
I can't remember.

12:10.207 --> 12:12.819
Shit! Think, Adam!

12:16.039 --> 12:19.521
Which one of you fucking retards
was screaming "Syria"

12:19.564 --> 12:21.871
and beaning kids
with water balloons?

12:23.438 --> 12:25.875
Well, I guess that
would be both of us.

12:25.919 --> 12:28.791
Well, not really.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.271
Both of us were throwing
water balloons,

12:30.314 --> 12:32.577
to be honest, but, you know,
it was for fun.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.144
[Adam] Yeah, but we were

12:34.188 --> 12:35.798
throwing water balloons,
but one of us

12:35.842 --> 12:37.104
was yelling "Syria";

12:37.147 --> 12:38.453
"Run, you little faggots";

12:38.496 --> 12:39.889
"Your rich parents
can't save you."

12:39.933 --> 12:41.064
That was one of us.

12:41.108 --> 12:42.065
[Clark] It got out of hand

12:42.109 --> 12:43.066
out there, man.

12:43.110 --> 12:44.415
What's your excuse?

12:44.459 --> 12:46.417
All right, OK, OK. Jesus Christ.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.245
You know what?
Get the fuck out of here.

12:48.289 --> 12:49.943
And take that
fucking shirt off.

12:49.986 --> 12:52.119
It's disturbing.
I'm gonna have nightmares.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.950
[Clark] It's not
play time, it's nap time.

12:56.993 --> 12:58.865
Adam.
No, just stay there.

12:58.908 --> 13:00.910
I'm gonna manage
everybody on my own.

13:00.954 --> 13:03.478
Keep drawing.
Do what you do.

13:03.521 --> 13:05.088
[Clark]
What's this idiot doing?

13:06.307 --> 13:08.309
He's creeping me out.

13:08.352 --> 13:10.833
I'm gonna tell you guys
a little story,

13:10.877 --> 13:12.879
and it doesn't end well
for you,

13:12.922 --> 13:14.837
you little bumblebee.

13:18.014 --> 13:20.321
What's up, Puraj?

13:20.364 --> 13:22.323
You OK?
Missing home?

13:22.366 --> 13:23.890
No.

13:25.152 --> 13:26.980
They picking on you again?

13:28.198 --> 13:29.634
Aw, come on, man.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.288
OK, look,
believe it or not,

13:31.332 --> 13:32.986
I wasn't always this cool.

13:33.029 --> 13:35.510
Kids used to mess
with me all the time.

13:37.512 --> 13:40.167
But, uh, you don't
care about that.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.822
You just want to
get 'em back, right?

13:54.007 --> 13:56.661
Eww! What was that?!

13:56.705 --> 13:58.185
Shut up and go
to sleep.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.152
Something wet keeps
on hitting me!

14:09.196 --> 14:11.154
Hey, kid, shut the fuck
up and go to sleep

14:11.198 --> 14:13.200
before I start
taking privileges.

14:19.597 --> 14:23.079
Hey, uh, excuse me.
Is--is she OK?

14:23.123 --> 14:24.646
You mean Katie?

14:24.689 --> 14:26.343
-Yeah.
-Yeah,

14:26.387 --> 14:28.345
she's great, except
for the big-ass dent

14:28.389 --> 14:30.304
that you put in her forehead
and the 4 stitches.

14:30.347 --> 14:32.654
-Four stitches?
-Mm-hmm.

14:32.697 --> 14:36.484
Shit. Well, can I apologize
to her or something?

14:36.527 --> 14:39.008
You can try, but if you'd
just split my head open,

14:39.052 --> 14:41.010
I'd bust you on your ass.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.490
OK.

14:45.623 --> 14:48.235
[chalk scrawling]

15:05.513 --> 15:08.472
You scared the shh
out of me.

15:08.516 --> 15:10.213
Shh out of you?

15:10.257 --> 15:12.215
What are you doing
lurking over me

15:12.259 --> 15:13.695
like that?
Are you crazy?

15:13.738 --> 15:16.045
I'm sorry. Look, I...

15:16.089 --> 15:17.568
I made you something.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.222
It's you with
your head split open

15:19.266 --> 15:21.181
and your brains falling out.

15:21.224 --> 15:22.399
Oh, look, please go.

15:22.443 --> 15:23.748
I really don't feel like
talking.

15:23.792 --> 15:26.012
[Adam]
I'm trying to apologize.

15:26.055 --> 15:29.232
No, you're not. You just feel
bad because you were acting

15:29.276 --> 15:31.234
like a moron and
somebody got hurt.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.975
Sorry if your
stupid doodles

15:33.019 --> 15:34.629
don't exactly lift y spirits.

15:34.672 --> 15:36.109
Stupid?

15:36.152 --> 15:37.501
Whatever. I tried.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.286
OK.
[sighs]

15:39.329 --> 15:40.722
Try not busting
anyone's head open

15:40.765 --> 15:42.202
on your way out.

15:42.245 --> 15:43.420
Douche bag.

15:43.464 --> 15:44.682
Oh, so you won't
say "shit,"

15:44.726 --> 15:46.032
but you'll say "douche bag"?

15:46.075 --> 15:47.294
Fine. Whatever. Forget about it.

15:47.337 --> 15:49.600
I'm not sorry, Katie. Fuck you.

15:49.644 --> 15:52.603
[nurse] Abandon hope!
We're going down! Ha ha ha!

15:52.647 --> 15:54.692
Fuck you, too!
Yeah, yeah.

15:54.736 --> 15:57.434
Fuck you! God--

15:57.478 --> 16:00.046
Uh-huh, and that's
what you get!

16:00.089 --> 16:02.178
Ha ha ha ha!

16:08.793 --> 16:11.100
[sighs]

16:13.798 --> 16:15.148
Mm-hmm.

16:26.115 --> 16:27.595
Rad.

16:27.638 --> 16:30.163
[chalk scrawling]

17:31.224 --> 17:34.705
Your douche-bag friend
dropped this off for ya.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.707
Thank you.

17:40.450 --> 17:42.409
[scoffs]

18:06.476 --> 18:09.131
What are you doing?
I look terrible.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.090
I've seen worse.

18:13.396 --> 18:14.876
Well, can I see it,
at least?

18:14.919 --> 18:16.443
No.

18:16.486 --> 18:18.662
What, it isn't another
apology doodle?

18:18.706 --> 18:20.664
No, you got yours.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.666
This is, uh...

18:22.710 --> 18:24.799
This is another one.
This is just for me.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.680
You like it?

18:38.247 --> 18:40.597
Yeah, I do.

18:40.641 --> 18:42.164
I actually really do.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.384
I think I can do better.

18:44.427 --> 18:46.386
Yeah, I'll start right now

18:46.429 --> 18:48.779
with that beautiful onesie.

18:48.823 --> 18:49.911
-[chuckles]
-Yeah, thanks.

18:49.954 --> 18:51.608
I know it. Ha!

18:51.652 --> 18:53.262
You know, earlier,

18:53.306 --> 18:54.785
before I twisted my ankle,

18:54.829 --> 18:56.483
when I said "Fuck you"

18:56.526 --> 18:58.485
and some other things?

18:58.528 --> 19:00.400
I apologize for that.

19:00.443 --> 19:01.966
Thanks.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.533
I really do.

19:05.622 --> 19:06.754
[grunts]

19:06.797 --> 19:08.277
OK, ready?

19:08.321 --> 19:10.279
There we go. I felt it.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.281
I felt the care, the love.

19:12.325 --> 19:14.501
-I don't usually--
-I don't like swearing.

19:14.544 --> 19:16.198
I don't usually say
fuck, you know.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.200
See, now, that
mildly offends me.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.723
That I just said that I--

19:19.767 --> 19:21.421
Mildly or, like, actually?

19:21.464 --> 19:22.944
-Mildly, mildly.
-OK.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.467
Fuck. Ha!

19:24.511 --> 19:26.339
Actually, uh,
I made something

19:26.382 --> 19:29.820
for you, and we can
talk to each other.

19:29.864 --> 19:31.822
[deep voice]
Hey, my name's Adam,

19:31.866 --> 19:34.303
and I'm really angry
all the time.

19:34.347 --> 19:35.826
[both laugh]

19:35.870 --> 19:37.480
[hums]

19:37.524 --> 19:39.482
Is that her?

19:39.526 --> 19:41.223
Yeah. "Hey, you!

19:41.267 --> 19:42.877
I'll bust your ass."

19:42.920 --> 19:45.227
-Ha ha ha ha!
-"I'll bust--mm-hmm.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.751
Mm-hmm"--oh, shit.

19:47.795 --> 19:50.754
Dizzy-ass white kids.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.278
Yeah, I'll bust your ass.

19:53.540 --> 19:54.715
Sorry.

19:55.977 --> 19:57.631
I really do respect you.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.589
[Katie giggling]

20:01.678 --> 20:04.594
"Dizzy-ass white kids."
Ha ha!

20:04.638 --> 20:07.597
How's your, uh, your wound?

20:07.641 --> 20:09.991
Oh, it's--it doesn't
hurt anymore.

20:10.034 --> 20:11.993
Here, can you see anything?

20:12.036 --> 20:14.996
They wanted to, like, shave
my head, but I said no.

20:15.039 --> 20:17.520
I can't--no.
You look--

20:17.564 --> 20:19.348
-Then yes, I'm fine.
-You look healthy.

20:19.392 --> 20:22.046
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.701
[chalk scrawling]

20:33.406 --> 20:35.321
[Adam]
Katie?

20:38.062 --> 20:39.977
Katie.

20:45.722 --> 20:47.681
-Ohh!
-[laughing]

20:47.724 --> 20:49.683
What the fuck?!

20:49.726 --> 20:51.685
Oh, my God!

20:51.728 --> 20:53.687
What is wrong with you?

20:55.079 --> 20:56.298
Are you kidding me?

20:56.342 --> 20:57.821
-Ha!
-Jesus!

20:57.865 --> 20:59.606
-Oh, my God.
-That's insane.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.738
-The look on your face.
-No, it's real funny.

21:01.782 --> 21:03.044
Real funny.

21:03.087 --> 21:05.046
What's wrong? I was just
kidding.

21:05.089 --> 21:07.396
I know, I--I thought
something might have

21:07.440 --> 21:09.093
happened to you.
I don't know.

21:09.137 --> 21:11.879
Like what? Why--
why would that matter?

21:11.922 --> 21:13.881
[sighs]

21:13.924 --> 21:15.056
When I was a kid,

21:15.099 --> 21:17.754
I...got lost in the woods.

21:17.798 --> 21:20.409
I got turned around
in the forest

21:20.453 --> 21:21.628
a couple blocks
from my house.

21:21.671 --> 21:22.803
You know, I was out there

21:22.846 --> 21:24.500
for a couple days.

21:24.544 --> 21:26.502
Oh.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.330
What'd you do?

21:28.374 --> 21:31.464
Found a log and I
crawled inside.

21:31.507 --> 21:32.639
I don't know. I was alone.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.467
[laughing]

21:34.510 --> 21:37.078
[scoffs]
What the hell?

21:37.121 --> 21:38.688
-Sorry, I'm sorry.
-That's hilarious to you.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.777
-Wow, OK.
-It's horrible. I'm sorry.

21:40.821 --> 21:42.605
I laugh at really
inappropriate times.

21:42.649 --> 21:45.608
No. "Inappropriate"?
This is beyond inappropriate.

21:45.652 --> 21:47.610
I'm baring my soul to you.

21:47.654 --> 21:49.960
I'm emotionally traumatized.

21:50.004 --> 21:51.788
Oh, no, I can't be
in a room alone.

21:51.832 --> 21:53.486
I have this phobia,
and it's funny to you.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.357
No, I'm sor--I'm--
I'm good. I'm sorry.

21:55.401 --> 21:56.750
-Done laughing at me?
-Sorry. Yeah.

21:56.793 --> 21:58.534
-And my pain?
-Yeah, I'm good.

21:58.578 --> 22:00.101
You know, you're messed up.

22:00.144 --> 22:01.755
Yeah.

22:03.757 --> 22:06.716
You know the really
messed-up thing?

22:06.760 --> 22:08.849
My ankle's totally fine.

22:12.635 --> 22:14.071
Are you tired?

22:15.682 --> 22:18.467
Um, no.
Not really. Why?

22:18.511 --> 22:20.469
Uh...what do you say

22:20.513 --> 22:21.992
we, you know,
sneak out of here?

22:22.036 --> 22:24.952
There's a staff meeting
tonight. No one's here.

22:34.048 --> 22:36.050
[Adam]
Like to come here by myself

22:36.093 --> 22:37.921
and relax sometimes,
you know.

22:37.965 --> 22:40.620
It's peaceful, quiet.

22:40.663 --> 22:43.144
OK, I, uh,

22:43.187 --> 22:45.842
I thought you had
a phobia of being alone.

22:45.886 --> 22:47.844
I--I mean, yeah,

22:47.888 --> 22:49.585
but I like to come here
and think, you know,

22:49.629 --> 22:52.066
and let the stillness
of the water relax me.

22:53.633 --> 22:56.113
[snickers]

22:56.157 --> 22:58.115
-What?
-I'm sorry.

22:58.159 --> 22:59.813
I'm sorry.
You--you know this is

22:59.856 --> 23:01.684
basically
the camp toilet, right?

23:01.728 --> 23:03.033
What the hell!
Why are you laughing?

23:03.077 --> 23:04.426
I'm trying to tell you--

23:04.470 --> 23:05.558
Adam, stop. This is ridiculous.

23:05.601 --> 23:07.429
What? I'm being serious.

23:07.473 --> 23:08.735
I'm trying to tell you that
I feel very connected--

23:08.778 --> 23:10.737
Adam.
[sighs]

23:10.780 --> 23:12.216
OK...

23:12.260 --> 23:14.218
this is all
very cute, but, um,

23:14.262 --> 23:16.046
seriously,
are you kidding?

23:16.090 --> 23:17.744
[scoffs]
Adam,

23:17.787 --> 23:20.573
you are not capable of
a serious relationship,

23:20.616 --> 23:22.923
and I came here to make out
with you and then to go to bed.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.056
W-what? No.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.885
Katie, I want to be
in a relationship, OK?

23:28.929 --> 23:30.887
I want to fall in love.

23:33.586 --> 23:36.458
So girls have
this tendency to gossip.

23:37.546 --> 23:39.853
It's kind of our thing.

23:39.896 --> 23:41.985
Everyone knows this is
your little sex den.

23:42.029 --> 23:44.074
My little sex den?

23:44.118 --> 23:45.859
-Yep.
-Wow.

23:45.902 --> 23:48.644
You know...

23:48.688 --> 23:52.213
my grandfather had
Alzheimer's,

23:52.256 --> 23:54.607
and every day,

23:54.650 --> 23:57.479
my grandma used
to change the date

23:57.523 --> 23:59.481
on his newspaper

23:59.525 --> 24:02.919
just so he wouldn't,
like, lose his mind.

24:02.963 --> 24:04.921
That's love.

24:04.965 --> 24:07.924
It's this false reality
you share with someone.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.491
That's how I feel
about you, Katie.

24:09.535 --> 24:11.101
[scoffs]
No, it isn't.

24:11.145 --> 24:12.755
[Katie] What you're feeling
is just a rush

24:12.799 --> 24:14.931
of 19-year-old-boy
testosterone

24:14.975 --> 24:16.933
with the intense desire
to jam your penis in me

24:16.977 --> 24:18.935
and, you know,
that's fine, too, but...

24:18.979 --> 24:20.589
-[scoffs]
-it's not love.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.199
[Adam] This is
what I love about you.

24:22.243 --> 24:24.506
Don't even use the word
"love" with me.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.682
It would be such a gross
misuse of the term that,

24:26.726 --> 24:29.511
as a woman, I'm actually
kind of offended.

24:29.555 --> 24:30.991
[Adam] But I don't mean
to offend you. I just--

24:31.034 --> 24:32.166
[Katie] Look, Adam, OK,

24:32.209 --> 24:34.037
I'm gonna make a rule.

24:34.081 --> 24:35.735
You can't say
those words to anyone

24:35.778 --> 24:38.259
until you actually
mean them, OK?

24:38.302 --> 24:40.000
Like, really mean them.

24:40.043 --> 24:42.611
Like, feel it in your
gut, can't keep it in

24:42.655 --> 24:45.048
or it might just burst out
of you kind of feeling.

24:45.092 --> 24:47.877
Until then, just don't, OK?

24:47.921 --> 24:50.184
-Do you promise?
-Yeah, yeah, I promise.

24:50.227 --> 24:51.968
Fuck! Katie, Jesus.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.579
Also, you shouldn't
swear so much.

24:53.622 --> 24:55.015
It makes you sound
kind of stupid.

24:55.058 --> 24:56.625
[scoffs]

24:56.669 --> 24:57.800
Can we make out now?

24:57.844 --> 24:59.019
Yeah, yeah,

24:59.062 --> 25:01.674
I guess so. I mean...

25:03.806 --> 25:05.721
[jet engine roaring]

25:08.811 --> 25:10.291
[explosion]

25:10.334 --> 25:11.684
Fuck!

25:11.727 --> 25:13.599
Forestry Station 14, this is

25:13.642 --> 25:15.165
Camp Yellowjacket. Over.

25:17.690 --> 25:20.823
Forestry Station 14, this is
Camp Yellowjacket. Over.

25:23.391 --> 25:26.002
Forestry Station 14,
this is Camp Yellowjacket.

25:26.046 --> 25:28.004
Is anyone there, please? Over.

25:28.048 --> 25:29.702
[overlapping radio chatter]

25:29.745 --> 25:31.355
[man on radio]
Camp Yellowjacket,

25:31.399 --> 25:34.010
this is Station 14.
That you, Kevin? Over.

25:34.054 --> 25:36.012
Uh, no, Frank.
It's Adam. Over.

25:36.056 --> 25:37.710
Uh, were you outside
a couple minutes ago?

25:37.753 --> 25:40.016
Did you see anything
fall from the sky? Over.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.235
You're breaking up,
Yellowjackets.

25:41.278 --> 25:42.671
Can you repeat that? Over.

25:42.715 --> 25:45.587
Uh, the, uh, counselors got

25:45.631 --> 25:47.807
all the kids settled
in their bunks.

25:47.850 --> 25:49.809
I don't think they're gonna
go to sleep anytime soon,

25:49.852 --> 25:52.028
but...at least
they're corralled, so...

25:52.072 --> 25:53.726
This is some crazy shit!

25:53.769 --> 25:57.120
A plane, a plane crashed
just outside camp. Over.

25:58.905 --> 26:00.210
Don't touch anything.

26:00.254 --> 26:01.864
Did you see where it hit? Over.

26:01.908 --> 26:03.866
Uh, near--near
Skyview Ridge, I think.

26:03.910 --> 26:05.694
One or two miles
south of us.

26:05.738 --> 26:08.610
-Over.
-All right, Yellowjacket.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.133
We're gonna send up
some rangers

26:10.177 --> 26:12.396
to investigate
the possible crash site.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.137
Just stay put,
take care of the kids.

26:14.181 --> 26:16.052
We don't want anybody
getting hurt.

26:16.096 --> 26:17.619
Over and out.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.621
Uh, y-yes, sir,
we'll stay here.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.101
Over.

26:22.755 --> 26:25.279
We're gonna go
up there, aren't we?

26:31.241 --> 26:35.376
I don't see how anyone
could have survived that.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.217
[Clark]
Holy shit.

26:54.438 --> 26:57.050
I--I'm staying here.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.372
[Clark]
What the fuck happened?

27:15.416 --> 27:16.809
[Katie]
Jesus Christ.

27:16.852 --> 27:18.375
Holy shit, man!

27:18.419 --> 27:20.290
[Adam]
This is fucking nuts.

27:20.334 --> 27:21.857
What's that smell, man?

27:21.901 --> 27:24.338
I shouldn't be breathing
this. It stinks.

27:25.818 --> 27:27.689
Guys?

27:27.733 --> 27:29.169
Guys!

27:46.490 --> 27:49.145
We need to leave.

27:49.189 --> 27:50.320
[gasps]

27:55.021 --> 27:57.023
Holy fuck!

27:57.066 --> 27:58.807
[man groaning]

27:58.851 --> 28:00.156
[whimpers]

28:00.200 --> 28:01.375
What do you think's
in there?

28:01.418 --> 28:02.724
I don't know, man.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.291
It could be secret documents

28:04.334 --> 28:06.467
proving God knows what.

28:06.510 --> 28:08.991
Could be CIA, NSA.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.819
[Katie]
Clark, let's just go.

28:10.863 --> 28:12.255
No, no, no,
we can't just

28:12.299 --> 28:13.474
leave this here
for some random people

28:13.517 --> 28:15.215
to stumble by and grab it.

28:15.258 --> 28:18.044
[growling]

28:19.393 --> 28:20.829
[Clark]
We'll take it back to camp...

28:20.873 --> 28:22.048
No, Clark, we need to leave.

28:22.091 --> 28:23.876
[Clark] ...collect a reward.

28:23.919 --> 28:26.443
-Seriously shut up.
-Hey, guys! Hey, guys!

28:26.487 --> 28:28.532
No, no, no, no. Look, look.
Listen, it's almost open.

28:28.576 --> 28:31.144
I'll just open it, and if it's
documents, we'll just leave it.

28:31.187 --> 28:32.275
Don't touch the case.
No, Clark!

28:32.319 --> 28:33.755
Ugh! What the--

28:33.799 --> 28:35.714
[Adam]
Shit.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.724
[Katie]
Adam, don't touch it.

28:48.422 --> 28:49.553
Aah!

28:49.597 --> 28:52.034
[Clark] Fuck! Oh! Get off of me!

28:52.078 --> 28:53.862
What the hell
is wrong with him?

28:53.906 --> 28:55.037
[vomits]

28:55.081 --> 28:57.039
-Jesus Christ!
-Shit!

[hissing and growling]

28:58.954 --> 29:00.782
[bones crack]

29:03.524 --> 29:06.788
[Clark] What the fuck
is wrong with him?

29:06.832 --> 29:09.095
What's up with his eyes?

29:09.138 --> 29:10.966
No, no, no, no.

29:11.010 --> 29:13.186
-[Katie] Clark! Clark!
-Aah!

29:13.229 --> 29:15.231
-Get off me, man!
-What the fuck!

29:15.275 --> 29:17.233
[Adam]
Get off my friend!

29:17.277 --> 29:19.235
-Come on!
-Get in the fucking truck!

29:19.279 --> 29:20.280
[Adam] Run!

29:20.323 --> 29:22.325
Run! Run!

29:22.369 --> 29:24.327
-Get up there!
-Hurry, hurry, hurry!

29:24.371 --> 29:26.286
Let's go!
Come on! Let's go!

29:28.897 --> 29:30.986
Shit!

29:31.030 --> 29:32.901
Whoa!

29:32.945 --> 29:34.207
-You OK?
-Yeah, man!

29:34.250 --> 29:35.991
Clark, get the fuck out of here!

29:36.035 --> 29:37.819
What was that?
What was that guy?

29:37.863 --> 29:41.040
[shouting indistinctly]

29:41.083 --> 29:42.389
[crash]

29:47.611 --> 29:50.136
[Adam screams]

29:54.488 --> 29:56.490
Aah!

29:58.927 --> 30:00.276
I'm fine.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.061
No, I'm fine, I'm fine,
totally normal.

30:02.104 --> 30:05.325
This happens, this happens
at camp. Aah!

30:05.368 --> 30:08.328
[man speaking Russian]

30:11.244 --> 30:13.115
[person breathing heavily]

30:34.658 --> 30:37.139
How are you feeling?

30:37.183 --> 30:38.488
Miss?

30:38.532 --> 30:40.447
How are you feeling?

[Subject 14 speaking Russian]

30:55.201 --> 30:56.898
[grunts]

30:56.942 --> 30:58.900
I'm fine.
It's all up in my head.

30:58.944 --> 31:01.337
It's all a dream.
Just a...

31:01.381 --> 31:03.992
Ha ha ha ha!

31:04.036 --> 31:06.168
I'm talking to
a fucking dead girl.

31:06.212 --> 31:07.343
Guy in a camp has

31:07.387 --> 31:08.910
stupid fucking memories

31:08.954 --> 31:10.216
that make no sense.

31:10.259 --> 31:13.262
Stupid memories!

31:13.306 --> 31:15.177
They make no sense.
No sense!

31:21.618 --> 31:23.577
Hey, Hon.

31:23.620 --> 31:26.058
How was surgery?

31:28.103 --> 31:29.626
Hon, surgery?

31:33.021 --> 31:34.631
W to the power of I

31:34.675 --> 31:36.503
equals N
to the power of I.

31:36.546 --> 31:38.984
Derivative over N to
the power of I

31:39.027 --> 31:41.203
equals K
to the power of I.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.642
Derivative over N to
the power of I

31:45.686 --> 31:48.950
equals K
to the power of I.

31:48.994 --> 31:51.605

Derivative over N

31:51.648 --> 31:52.998

31:53.041 --> 31:56.305
minus A Z to the power of...

31:56.349 --> 31:58.003
[Adam] Jess,
are you good at math?

31:58.046 --> 31:59.352
Jess?

31:59.395 --> 32:00.919
Any idea what that means?

32:03.095 --> 32:05.575
Jess, I don't know.

32:05.619 --> 32:07.403
-I do.
-Yeah--

32:07.447 --> 32:09.231
[Jess]
What's the big deal?

32:09.275 --> 32:12.060
It's camp. Why is everyone
so serious around here?

32:12.104 --> 32:14.584
Look, I know.
It's just...

32:14.628 --> 32:15.759
Maybe I should go.

32:15.803 --> 32:17.761
No, no, look,

32:17.805 --> 32:19.763
I know it's not
a big deal. It's not.

32:19.807 --> 32:23.071
I just don't want to
hurt anyone, you know?

32:23.115 --> 32:24.464
I...

32:24.507 --> 32:28.468
Fine. Just keep it
between us, OK?

32:32.037 --> 32:33.995
Ho! Oh!

32:34.039 --> 32:35.431
What the fuck?!

32:35.475 --> 32:37.433
I just felt my dick in me! I--

32:37.477 --> 32:40.436
Jess, I felt my dick...

32:40.480 --> 32:42.047
fuck me--I just fucked myself!

32:44.310 --> 32:46.094
What the fuck.
I'm losing my mind.

32:57.671 --> 33:01.544
Jess, we shouldn't
have gone up there.

33:04.373 --> 33:05.505
It was so stupid.

33:19.345 --> 33:20.520
You look better.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.397
God damn, I must
be going crazy.

33:30.182 --> 33:32.532
But, you know,
it could be worse.

33:34.577 --> 33:37.363
Could be alone...
right?

34:03.824 --> 34:05.434
Katie? Katie!

34:05.478 --> 34:07.219
[Clark] Shhhhhh.

34:07.262 --> 34:08.568
[Adam] What? What is it?

34:14.922 --> 34:16.358
[Adam] Holy shit.

34:17.793 --> 34:19.579
We can't go out there, man.

34:19.621 --> 34:21.668
-Clark, what the fuck?
-We can't help her.

34:21.710 --> 34:23.103
What are you talking about, man?

34:23.148 --> 34:24.409
[Clark] Shut up!

34:26.585 --> 34:28.804
You've been out, man.

34:28.849 --> 34:32.244
You've been passed out.

34:32.286 --> 34:35.464
You don't understand the
gravity of the situation.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.553
I'm trying to help you.

34:37.597 --> 34:38.728
What are you talking about?

34:41.427 --> 34:44.386
He's still out there.

34:44.429 --> 34:47.607
That psycho guy from the plane.
You know?

34:47.650 --> 34:50.478
[Clark] That fucking
thing that attacked us.

34:50.523 --> 34:52.873
[Clark] He, like, leaned over
Jess and he vomited some kind

34:52.916 --> 34:54.918
of black shit in her face.

34:54.962 --> 34:56.746
He's still
fucking out there.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.400
[Adam] Clark, we can't just
leave her out there.

34:58.444 --> 35:00.272
she's fucking alive.

35:00.315 --> 35:01.577
Shut the fuck up.

35:02.622 --> 35:04.624
Help. Help me.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.147
Look at her, man,
it's Jess!

35:06.191 --> 35:07.322
He's waiting for us.

35:07.366 --> 35:09.368
Let me out of the car, Clark!

35:09.411 --> 35:11.196
[Clark] It's a trap,
Adam, it's a trap.

35:11.239 --> 35:12.371
Get off me, man!

35:13.633 --> 35:15.852
Oh, my God.

35:15.896 --> 35:17.550
[Clark] I warned you!
I tried to warn you.

35:20.857 --> 35:23.469
-[Katie] What was that?
-It's just an animal. Come on.

35:23.512 --> 35:24.905
-[Katie] Adam.
-[Adam] Katie, come on.

35:24.948 --> 35:27.690
I warned you,
I tried to warn you.

Come on, god dammit.

36:10.777 --> 36:12.561
Hey, we got to walk.

36:12.605 --> 36:13.823
What?

36:17.523 --> 36:19.438

36:23.485 --> 36:24.617

want me to do?

What do we do?
What do we do?

37:39.735 --> 37:40.780
[Katie] I don't know.

37:42.564 --> 37:43.783
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

38:27.435 --> 38:29.785
We can see it all.

38:33.833 --> 38:36.792
[deeper voice]
We can see everything.

38:36.836 --> 38:38.098
Jess...

38:40.753 --> 38:41.928
baby?

38:41.971 --> 38:44.147
We're gonna get you help, OK?

38:44.191 --> 38:45.888
You don't need to help us.

38:47.194 --> 38:48.848
Us?

38:48.891 --> 38:51.372
Clark, come closer.

38:53.418 --> 38:54.767
Dude.

38:54.810 --> 38:56.334
[Jess] Come closer.

Closer.

-[Katie] Adam.

39:16.528 --> 39:17.659

He's stabbed.

39:41.640 --> 39:42.815
Goddamnit.

39:59.701 --> 40:02.095
[Yuri] Hello again,
Subject 14.

40:02.138 --> 40:03.749
How are you feeling today?

40:03.792 --> 40:05.707
[speaking Russian]

40:05.751 --> 40:07.143
[Yuri] It's back to we again.

40:30.558 --> 40:32.734
[Yuri] Anyway,
this strain is unusable

40:32.778 --> 40:34.693
and it's piece of shit.

40:38.610 --> 40:40.002
[Yuri] Yes, Subject 14?

40:45.268 --> 40:46.574
[Yuri] That's quite impossible.

40:54.887 --> 40:57.150
Your question is irrelevant.

41:05.071 --> 41:08.117
Subject 3 has broken free.

41:08.161 --> 41:10.119
We are freeing Subject 8

41:10.163 --> 41:12.644
and 9 as we speak.

41:12.687 --> 41:15.777
We will be inside this
room in 30 seconds.

41:19.259 --> 41:21.783
That's not going to stop us.

41:21.827 --> 41:23.132
We'll still get in.

41:23.176 --> 41:25.613
Isn't this what
you wanted, Yuri?

41:25.657 --> 41:28.137
Isn't this easier?

41:28.181 --> 41:30.662
The time is coming.

41:30.705 --> 41:32.011
You'll need to decide.

41:32.054 --> 41:34.622
It's a simple choice.

41:34.666 --> 41:37.059
You should have known, Yuri.

41:37.103 --> 41:39.235
We were never going
to be controlled.

41:41.107 --> 41:44.676
Shooting this body will
not change the outcome.

41:44.719 --> 41:47.896
We will be in this
room in 10 seconds.

41:47.940 --> 41:49.637
[Yuri] To the mask.
Get the mask!

42:07.394 --> 42:08.830
[screaming]

42:14.053 --> 42:15.228
What the fuck?

42:34.987 --> 42:36.336
[exhales]

42:37.729 --> 42:38.860
[gasping]

42:44.170 --> 42:45.911
Here. Let me help you.
[sniffles]

42:47.216 --> 42:48.566
[Katie] What are you doing?

42:51.046 --> 42:52.221
OK, this might hurt.

42:53.440 --> 42:54.746
-Ready?
-Yeah.

42:56.878 --> 42:58.358
-[winces]
-Sorry.

42:58.401 --> 42:59.968
Haa! Heh.

43:02.667 --> 43:03.711
How does that feel?

Um, OK, well, I guess
we gotta go get the van,

43:20.859 --> 43:22.687
and start moving kids out.

my plan now

His penis was
bigger than yours.

49:22.394 --> 49:24.483
Nothing worth
being upset about.

49:26.702 --> 49:28.966
But she had
intercourse with him.

49:31.055 --> 49:37.452
And he performed
above average.

49:37.496 --> 49:40.325

by the lake with Adam.

thinking about it.

50:36.685 --> 50:39.210
And masturbating about it.

50:41.255 --> 50:42.343
Well, it's perfectly

unconscious 8-year-old girl.

of this girl

51:41.315 --> 51:44.927
an equation only known by
scholars of Price himself?

56:02.750 --> 56:04.665
It will all be over soon.

56:04.709 --> 56:06.406
Make it stop. Make it stop!

56:14.719 --> 56:17.156
We're connected with her.

56:17.199 --> 56:21.029
It's done. That simple.

56:21.073 --> 56:22.553
Fuck you.
What did you do to her?

56:25.556 --> 56:27.558
We've improved her.

56:27.601 --> 56:29.821
She'll be with us soon.

56:29.864 --> 56:32.519
It's much better this way.

56:32.563 --> 56:34.434
You'll see.

56:34.478 --> 56:36.393
[groaning]

56:39.091 --> 56:41.876
She's whispering something.

56:41.920 --> 56:43.530
What?

56:43.574 --> 56:44.662
What is she saying, Jess?

56:46.838 --> 56:48.753
Adam, run!

56:51.582 --> 56:52.931
Jess, speak to me, please!

56:55.629 --> 56:56.848
What?

57:05.552 --> 57:07.467
Fuck!
[bat clatters on floor]

57:21.220 --> 57:24.919
[Clark] Adam. Adam.

57:24.963 --> 57:26.051
Shut up.

57:28.270 --> 57:30.447
[Clark] Adam, let us in.

57:36.191 --> 57:38.280
[Clark] Adam.

57:38.324 --> 57:41.196
We know a sign is
telling you not

57:41.240 --> 57:42.894
to let us in.

57:44.156 --> 57:46.593
Ignore that.

57:46.637 --> 57:47.942
We have to talk.

57:47.986 --> 57:49.901
Yeah, I'm good, thanks.

57:49.944 --> 57:52.904
[Clark] Relax, Adam.

57:52.947 --> 57:55.123
If we wanted you dead,
we would set

57:55.167 --> 57:57.604
the building on fire.

57:57.648 --> 57:59.563
Go away, Clark.

57:59.606 --> 58:03.044
[Clark] There really isn't
anything you can do.

58:03.088 --> 58:06.134
One way or another,
we're getting in there.

58:08.136 --> 58:12.619
You open the door.
Do it the easy way.

58:12.663 --> 58:16.754
We'll say what we
have to say and then leave.

58:16.797 --> 58:18.756
You have our word.

58:23.717 --> 58:25.110
If you try anything, you're
dead.

58:37.601 --> 58:38.776
That's enough.

58:42.040 --> 58:44.042
[Clark] Poor Adam.

58:46.610 --> 58:50.744
Still this lost boy,

58:50.788 --> 58:52.180
hiding in a log.

58:52.224 --> 58:53.791
Where is she?

58:57.011 --> 59:00.580
Is that what this is about?

59:00.624 --> 59:02.321
Did you lose your girlfriend?

59:08.762 --> 59:10.155
Do you feel in control?

59:11.896 --> 59:13.854
I feel like you don't
tell me where Katie is,

59:13.898 --> 59:15.116
I'm gonna see
the inside of your skull

59:15.160 --> 59:17.597
across this fucking floor.

59:17.641 --> 59:20.992
You hate us for
taking Katie, don't you?

59:22.646 --> 59:26.911
It was easy. You abandoned
her at that van.

59:26.954 --> 59:28.260
No, I didn't.

59:28.303 --> 59:30.088
-You didn't?
-No, I didn't.

59:30.131 --> 59:32.351
When we found her,
she was all alone.

59:34.266 --> 59:36.703
She was afraid.

59:36.747 --> 59:39.837
Shut up.
Shut up!

59:39.880 --> 59:41.708
You could have
protected her.

59:41.752 --> 59:43.710
You left her instead.

59:43.754 --> 59:44.972
She was scared.

59:45.016 --> 59:47.148
You could've protected her.

59:47.192 --> 59:48.367
You could've
protected her, but you

59:48.410 --> 59:50.891
let her fend for herself.

59:50.935 --> 59:52.414
You let her go.

59:52.458 --> 59:55.722
She was begging,
please don't turn me.

59:55.766 --> 59:58.812
I was the one
to hold her down.

59:58.856 --> 01:00:02.337
[groaning]

01:00:02.381 --> 01:00:04.688
How does it feel, Adam?

01:00:04.731 --> 01:00:06.428
How does it feel
to lose somebody

01:00:06.472 --> 01:00:09.431
that you love?

01:00:09.475 --> 01:00:12.913
We have found
that intense anger

01:00:12.957 --> 01:00:16.917
is the best cure
for your pocket.

01:00:16.961 --> 01:00:18.876
[groaning]

01:00:23.054 --> 01:00:24.359
Aah!

01:00:33.804 --> 01:00:35.414
Uhh.

01:00:35.457 --> 01:00:37.111
[Adam] Clark.

01:00:53.432 --> 01:00:55.695
The truth is,

01:00:55.739 --> 01:00:57.436
I don't hate you.

01:00:57.479 --> 01:00:58.959
I love you like a brother.

01:00:59.003 --> 01:01:00.918
You do?

01:01:00.961 --> 01:01:04.399
Yeah. But I have a message
for you to deliver

01:01:04.443 --> 01:01:06.706
to all your little friends.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:07.968
There's something
I want them to see.

01:01:11.189 --> 01:01:12.712
[thud]

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:14.366
I will find her.

01:01:14.409 --> 01:01:16.281
[Clark] Do it.

01:01:16.324 --> 01:01:19.980
Embrace your anger.

01:01:20.024 --> 01:01:21.721
I'm not angry.

01:01:29.424 --> 01:01:30.687
[bat clatters on floor]

01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:45.397
Oh, shit.

01:02:03.328 --> 01:02:04.808
Where am I?

01:02:06.287 --> 01:02:08.115
Oh, oh, shit!

01:02:08.159 --> 01:02:09.290
Oh, what the fuck?

01:02:09.334 --> 01:02:11.162
Wait, Jess! Jess!

01:02:11.205 --> 01:02:13.512
Jess, Jess, stop it.

01:02:13.555 --> 01:02:14.861
Fucking stop, Jess.

01:02:14.905 --> 01:02:16.428
Look at me! It's Adam.

01:02:16.471 --> 01:02:18.125
Please just tell
me where Katie is.

01:02:18.169 --> 01:02:20.475
I don't know.
I don't know.

01:02:56.903 --> 01:02:58.035
How do I look?

01:02:59.253 --> 01:03:01.473
You look beautiful.

01:03:01.516 --> 01:03:03.475
[coughing]

01:03:08.219 --> 01:03:10.612
-Adam, you should leave.
-No.

01:03:10.656 --> 01:03:12.266
You need to get out of here.

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:13.441
You can save us.
You can still have a life.

01:03:13.485 --> 01:03:16.357
No. I'm not leaving you, Katie.

01:03:24.278 --> 01:03:27.064
You know, I was
wrong about you.

01:03:27.107 --> 01:03:28.587
No, you weren't.

01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:31.459
Oh, if this
had been last week,

01:03:31.503 --> 01:03:33.157
I would be halfway
down the mountain

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.421
right now getting pie

01:03:36.464 --> 01:03:38.162
waiting for the government

01:03:38.205 --> 01:03:40.077
to napalm this place.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.122
That's nice.

01:03:42.166 --> 01:03:44.298
Yeah?

01:03:44.342 --> 01:03:46.344
You know, there's an
argument to be made

01:03:46.387 --> 01:03:48.259
that you're one
of the worse things

01:03:48.302 --> 01:03:50.130
that's ever happened to me.

01:03:50.174 --> 01:03:52.132

experiment in 1984

Then--then we've got
this thing called a pocket,

01:05:34.582 --> 01:05:36.019
which I have
no idea what that is.

Ah!

01:06:21.847 --> 01:06:25.024
Has to all be connected,
right?

01:06:31.422 --> 01:06:32.771
OK.

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:36.470
This is your base of operation.

01:06:36.514 --> 01:06:38.124
Of course, you'll have
as many assistants

01:06:38.168 --> 01:06:40.344
as you see fit,
handpicked, of course.

01:06:40.387 --> 01:06:42.302
Your lab, your personnel.

01:06:42.346 --> 01:06:43.477
If there's any piece
of equipment

01:06:43.521 --> 01:06:45.088
that you need that isn't here,

01:06:45.131 --> 01:06:46.350
you let me know,
and I'll get it to you

01:06:46.393 --> 01:06:47.742
as fast as I can.

01:06:47.786 --> 01:06:49.309
Just remember,
we're government.

01:06:49.353 --> 01:06:50.789
We work at the speed of
government.

01:06:50.832 --> 01:06:53.270
The notes from previous
experiments are--

01:06:53.313 --> 01:06:54.662
Oh, good.

I don't speak Russian.

Ah. Here are
the translations.

01:07:01.887 --> 01:07:04.455
"Initial trials are encouraging.

01:07:04.498 --> 01:07:06.239
Subjects are
telepathically linked,

allowing them to share
thoughts and memories.

They've become
a single entity--

to disconnect themselves
from the Hive

of time.

I have dubbed these
glitches pockets.

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.081
During this time,
their individualism

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:23.735
is restored,
but they suffer

01:07:23.778 --> 01:07:26.172
from disorientation
and memory loss."

01:09:40.263 --> 01:09:42.352
and couldn't protect her.

01:09:44.354 --> 01:09:48.270
288 friends on Facebook,

01:09:48.314 --> 01:09:51.535
115 friends on Instagram,

01:09:51.578 --> 01:09:53.232
the memories
of seven billion people

01:09:53.276 --> 01:09:54.581
stuck in my fucking head.

01:09:56.670 --> 01:09:58.281
Ah!

01:09:58.324 --> 01:10:00.544
I have to focus.

01:10:00.587 --> 01:10:03.286
I can remember
anything if I focus.

01:10:12.295 --> 01:10:13.948
Holy shit.

01:10:13.992 --> 01:10:15.994
It's like...

01:10:16.037 --> 01:10:17.430
I can remember anything.

01:10:17.474 --> 01:10:19.258
It's like Google.

01:10:19.302 --> 01:10:22.479
If I just focus on something...

01:10:27.048 --> 01:10:29.312
All right. Enough of that.

01:10:29.355 --> 01:10:31.314
Katie.

01:10:34.491 --> 01:10:37.537
What's going on?
What's wrong with her?

01:10:37.581 --> 01:10:38.712
Hold on.

01:10:38.756 --> 01:10:40.758
[sobs]

01:10:42.325 --> 01:10:44.370
You snapped
out of it, right?

01:10:44.414 --> 01:10:46.807
So whatever you did,
she can do, too.

01:10:46.851 --> 01:10:49.723
Uh, I don't know. I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:10:49.767 --> 01:10:51.421
Jess, what happened?
Please just tell me.

01:10:51.464 --> 01:10:53.423
Uh, um...

01:10:53.466 --> 01:10:54.772
What? Jess, talk to me.

01:10:54.815 --> 01:10:56.469
I don't know! I--I felt
something.

01:10:56.513 --> 01:10:58.863
I was freaking out,
and then I just--

01:10:58.906 --> 01:11:00.343
Think.

01:11:00.386 --> 01:11:01.909
I--I--

01:11:01.953 --> 01:11:04.912
I saw--I saw--
I saw faces.

01:11:04.956 --> 01:11:06.566
I saw your--
yours and her face,

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:08.002
and then I--
I don't know--

01:11:08.046 --> 01:11:09.656
I woke up in this chair,

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.310
and I'm tied up in this chair.

01:11:11.354 --> 01:11:13.573
It's all I know.

01:11:13.617 --> 01:11:15.967
Wait. So if you
remember something

01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:18.056
from your life or
something emotional,

01:11:18.099 --> 01:11:20.319
you can--can come
back from it?

01:11:22.843 --> 01:11:24.018
Uh...

01:11:24.062 --> 01:11:25.977
I need your help, OK, Jess?

01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:27.413
We're gonna get
out of this shit hole,

01:11:27.457 --> 01:11:28.719
- I swear to God.
- OK.

01:11:29.981 --> 01:11:32.070
[Yuri speaking Russian]

01:11:42.863 --> 01:11:44.952
[woman] Dr. Baker,
you have another applicant

01:11:44.996 --> 01:11:47.346
in your office.

01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:49.957
I'm waiting on--

01:11:50.001 --> 01:11:52.525
Fine. I'll go in there now.
I don't know how you expect me

01:11:52.569 --> 01:11:54.353
to get any work done
around here.

01:11:57.661 --> 01:12:00.141
What's happening?

01:12:00.185 --> 01:12:01.839
We're waiting.

01:12:01.882 --> 01:12:04.842
Hi. I'm Dr. Baker,
and you are...

01:12:04.885 --> 01:12:06.583
My name is Yuri.

01:12:06.626 --> 01:12:09.455
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
I thought--

01:12:09.499 --> 01:12:12.371
-I thought your name was--
-It's Yuri.

01:12:12.415 --> 01:12:13.981
OK. Well are you familiar
with the position?

01:12:14.025 --> 01:12:16.984
I'm not here
for the position.

01:12:17.028 --> 01:12:19.030
I don't understand,
but we're very busy.

01:12:19.073 --> 01:12:21.467
Uh, my name is Yuri.

01:12:21.511 --> 01:12:22.468
Yeah. I got that.

01:12:22.512 --> 01:12:24.078
Yegorov.

01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:29.562
Dr. Yegorov?

01:12:29.606 --> 01:12:31.477
Once Katie turns,
we're gonna--

01:12:31.521 --> 01:12:33.610
we're gonna remind her
of something to bring

01:12:33.653 --> 01:12:35.960
her back just like
you were brought back.

01:12:36.003 --> 01:12:37.657
That's not gonna work.

01:12:37.701 --> 01:12:38.963
Why not?

01:12:39.006 --> 01:12:40.181
It's too late!

01:12:40.225 --> 01:12:41.879
Uh!

01:12:44.925 --> 01:12:46.666
I have so many
questions for you.

01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:48.494
I've read all your notes.

01:12:48.538 --> 01:12:50.801
The virus is shockingly
resistant to change. I've been--

01:12:50.844 --> 01:12:52.890
Dr. Baker, I know
where you're going.

01:12:52.933 --> 01:12:54.979
Aah! Aah!

01:12:55.022 --> 01:12:56.502
The subjects
will become hostile

01:12:56.546 --> 01:12:59.026
and determined to spread.

01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:01.028
Their intelligence
and brain power

01:13:01.072 --> 01:13:02.726
by far exceeds our own.

01:13:02.769 --> 01:13:05.859
It's impossible
to control them.

01:13:05.903 --> 01:13:08.732
This is evil.

01:13:08.775 --> 01:13:11.474
With all due respect,
doctor, we disagree.

01:13:11.517 --> 01:13:13.432
Don't write it off as evil

01:13:13.476 --> 01:13:15.695
just because you
failed to control it.

01:13:15.739 --> 01:13:17.567
Uh! Uh!

01:13:20.831 --> 01:13:22.572
Uh!

01:13:22.615 --> 01:13:23.877
I've been poring over
your work for months.

01:13:23.921 --> 01:13:25.705
I thought you were a genius.

01:13:25.749 --> 01:13:27.881
Dr. Baker, do you know
what word "kaniez" means?

01:13:27.925 --> 01:13:29.883
I don't know that word.

01:13:29.927 --> 01:13:33.060
It means the end.

01:13:33.104 --> 01:13:34.540
Ah! Uh! Ah!

01:13:34.584 --> 01:13:35.933
Adam...

01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:52.079
Aagh!

01:13:52.123 --> 01:13:53.951
Uh!

01:13:53.994 --> 01:13:55.866
Aagh...

01:13:55.909 --> 01:13:57.563
Fuck.

01:14:00.174 --> 01:14:02.133
Uh!

01:14:03.569 --> 01:14:05.919
Oh, shit.

01:14:05.963 --> 01:14:07.704
[coughs]

01:14:11.142 --> 01:14:12.883
[Adam] Katie.

01:14:12.926 --> 01:14:15.146
Katie, stay with me.

01:14:18.628 --> 01:14:20.151
[Katie coughing]

01:14:29.073 --> 01:14:31.597
Katie, I'm gonna
figure this out, OK,

01:14:31.641 --> 01:14:34.470
and then--and then
I'll come back from you.

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:44.610
Katie, stay alive
and hang on.

01:14:49.702 --> 01:14:51.530
[Katie] Adam, wait.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:58.668
Where is she?

01:15:00.365 --> 01:15:03.150
I will find her.

01:15:04.587 --> 01:15:06.197
Oh, Katie.

01:15:09.635 --> 01:15:12.986
[hisses]

01:15:16.207 --> 01:15:18.078
We were expecting you.

01:15:18.122 --> 01:15:19.993
Look, Katie.
Look at me, OK?

01:15:20.037 --> 01:15:22.779
You can come out of this.
Just remember who you are.

01:15:22.822 --> 01:15:24.345
Remember what's
important to you.

01:15:24.389 --> 01:15:28.698
We know what
you're trying to do.

01:15:31.788 --> 01:15:35.574
We don't want to change.

01:15:35.618 --> 01:15:38.055
We're perfect now.

01:15:40.144 --> 01:15:42.886
Your pocket
will end soon,

01:15:42.929 --> 01:15:45.323
and you will
be back with us.

01:15:48.761 --> 01:15:50.894
It's better this way, Adam.

01:15:53.157 --> 01:15:55.551
Can't you see?

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.599
You will never
have to be alone again.

01:16:00.643 --> 01:16:02.862
No. No.

01:16:02.906 --> 01:16:07.606
We know how this
conversation ends,

01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:11.958
and while you're
doing the wrong thing,

01:16:12.002 --> 01:16:13.873
it's--

01:16:13.917 --> 01:16:17.050
it's important to us
that you don't feel sad.

01:16:17.094 --> 01:16:19.705
How does this
conversation end?

01:16:19.749 --> 01:16:24.188
With you bashing
Katie's head in

01:16:24.231 --> 01:16:26.233
with your bat.

01:16:26.277 --> 01:16:30.281
If you are smarter than me,
then where is everyone?

01:16:30.324 --> 01:16:32.326
Why haven't you burned
this place to the ground?

01:16:32.370 --> 01:16:34.154
I mean, you saw what
I did with Clark.

01:16:34.198 --> 01:16:36.026
Why haven't you sent
in your little drones

01:16:36.069 --> 01:16:38.071
to come help save you?

01:16:39.682 --> 01:16:43.729
You are of no threat to us.

01:16:43.773 --> 01:16:46.776
This body is
of little importance.

01:16:46.819 --> 01:16:48.865
It's important to me.

01:16:49.953 --> 01:16:52.172
We know.

01:16:52.216 --> 01:16:53.652
You know when I first told you

01:16:53.696 --> 01:16:55.088
about my feelings for you

01:16:55.132 --> 01:16:57.438
before any of
this shit happened,

01:16:57.482 --> 01:17:00.267
it wasn't really it.

01:17:02.008 --> 01:17:04.141
We know.

01:17:06.926 --> 01:17:09.973
You're not as smart
as you think you are.

01:17:12.715 --> 01:17:15.631
You were wrong
about the bat.

01:17:27.947 --> 01:17:29.993
Nngh...

01:17:30.036 --> 01:17:31.777
Uh...

01:17:33.518 --> 01:17:36.739
[Katie] Look, Adam. OK.
I'm gonna make a rule.

01:17:36.782 --> 01:17:38.871
You can't say
those words to anyone

01:17:38.915 --> 01:17:41.395
until you actually
mean them, OK,

01:17:41.439 --> 01:17:44.050
like, really mean them,
like, feel it

01:17:44.094 --> 01:17:45.878
in your gut,
can't keep it in

01:17:45.922 --> 01:17:48.359
or it might just burst out
of you kind of feeling.

01:17:48.402 --> 01:17:50.230
Until then just--

01:17:50.274 --> 01:17:52.929
Until then
just don't, OK?

01:17:52.972 --> 01:17:54.495
Nngh...

01:17:54.539 --> 01:17:56.976
I love you, Katie.

01:18:19.085 --> 01:18:21.044
OK.

01:18:21.087 --> 01:18:23.742
[exhales]

01:18:26.005 --> 01:18:28.268
Apparently, it was a jolt
of electiricty

01:18:28.312 --> 01:18:30.488
that restarted my heart, and then I woke up in the hospital.

01:18:31.576 --> 01:18:33.012
[machine gun fire]

01:18:33.056 --> 01:18:34.840
- Come on!
- Oh...

01:18:34.884 --> 01:18:37.190
Can't fucking die!

01:18:37.234 --> 01:18:38.844
Oh, shit.

01:18:38.888 --> 01:18:42.326
Up, up, up.

01:18:42.369 --> 01:18:43.936
[gunfire continues]

01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:46.112
OK. Come on.
Come on.

01:18:46.156 --> 01:18:48.854
Come on. Come on.

01:18:48.898 --> 01:18:51.074
What the fuck happened?

01:18:52.162 --> 01:18:53.772
Uh!

01:19:03.608 --> 01:19:05.958
OK. Here we go.
This better work.

01:19:06.002 --> 01:19:09.222
One, two...

01:19:09.266 --> 01:19:11.355
three.

01:19:11.398 --> 01:19:12.443
[zap]

01:19:12.486 --> 01:19:14.358
Katie, wake up. Katie?

01:19:14.401 --> 01:19:16.012
[zap]

01:19:16.055 --> 01:19:18.318
Wake up, Katie, please!

01:19:18.362 --> 01:19:20.407
[zap]

01:19:20.451 --> 01:19:22.235
[Katie gasping]

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:25.978
Holy shit. Katie?

01:19:26.022 --> 01:19:28.546
Oh, my God, it worked.
Here, sit up. Sit up.

01:19:28.589 --> 01:19:32.158
Come on. Just--
Just breathe. Just breathe.

01:19:32.202 --> 01:19:34.378
It's OK. It's OK.

01:19:34.421 --> 01:19:35.988
[panting]

01:19:36.032 --> 01:19:37.816
Ah!

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:39.775
Katie, focus
on breathing.

01:19:42.386 --> 01:19:44.997
Trust--trust me.
Trust me, Katie, please.

01:19:45.041 --> 01:19:47.217
Who the fuck is Katie,

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:49.523
and who the fuck are you?

01:19:49.567 --> 01:19:52.875
You swore. That's good.

01:19:57.575 --> 01:19:59.316
Oh...

01:20:00.404 --> 01:20:02.319
[Katie] Adam, wait.

01:20:11.937 --> 01:20:14.810
[pounding on door]

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:28.606
[hammering continues]

01:20:35.047 --> 01:20:36.570
You came out of it.

01:20:36.614 --> 01:20:38.355
You had no memories at all.

01:20:38.398 --> 01:20:41.140
You had no idea
who you were or where you were,

01:20:41.184 --> 01:20:43.534
so I'm gonna give myself
a little note,

01:20:43.577 --> 01:20:45.231
a reminder.

01:20:52.325 --> 01:20:54.893
[coughs]

01:20:54.937 --> 01:20:56.155
[gasps]

01:20:56.199 --> 01:20:57.591
Ah!

01:20:57.635 --> 01:20:59.289
[coughing]

01:20:59.332 --> 01:21:03.423
Please never ask me
to do that again.

01:21:03.467 --> 01:21:05.948
I think I shit myself.

01:21:05.991 --> 01:21:07.645
Can you please tell me

01:21:07.688 --> 01:21:10.169
what the hell is going on now?

01:21:10.213 --> 01:21:13.346
It will all start
to make more sense

01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:16.480
when your memory starts
to come back to you.

01:21:16.523 --> 01:21:18.047
Oh, shit, for now,
we have to get

01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:19.135
the fuck out
of this infirmary.

01:21:19.178 --> 01:21:20.527
OK.

01:21:20.571 --> 01:21:23.226
There's a van
in the parking lot.

01:21:23.269 --> 01:21:24.488
It's our best bet.

01:21:24.531 --> 01:21:26.142
If we take the forest path,

01:21:26.185 --> 01:21:27.970
there's a chance
we'll get there unnoticed.

01:21:28.013 --> 01:21:29.928
But I don't even remember--

01:21:29.972 --> 01:21:33.149
Katie, Katie-- Katie, you're
gonna have to trust me, OK?

01:21:33.192 --> 01:21:35.194
Everything's gonna be OK.

01:21:35.238 --> 01:21:37.414
There's some masks and gloves

01:21:37.457 --> 01:21:38.937
behind the nurses' desk, OK?

01:21:38.981 --> 01:21:40.373
We'll get those before we leave.

01:21:40.417 --> 01:21:41.897
OK.

01:21:47.424 --> 01:21:48.381
Let's go.

01:21:48.425 --> 01:21:49.556
[creaking]

01:22:23.677 --> 01:22:25.505
[coughing]

01:22:42.653 --> 01:22:45.090
Oh, remember.

01:22:46.309 --> 01:22:47.963
Remember.

01:22:49.094 --> 01:22:50.966
Oh, it's up to me.

01:23:13.336 --> 01:23:15.294
- Nobody moves.
- Do what he says.

01:23:15.338 --> 01:23:17.470
Back up. Back up.

01:23:17.514 --> 01:23:19.995
Give me the samples.
All of them!

01:23:25.348 --> 01:23:27.045
Don't do this.

01:23:27.089 --> 01:23:29.221
Dr. Baker, unless you
want to die today,

01:23:29.265 --> 01:23:31.441
I suggest you do
everything I say.

01:23:31.484 --> 01:23:33.660
Put them in.

01:23:33.704 --> 01:23:35.314
- Is this everything you have?
- Yes. Yes.

01:23:35.358 --> 01:23:37.360
- Is this everything you have?
- Yes!

01:24:09.696 --> 01:24:12.699
Come on. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

01:24:12.743 --> 01:24:15.354
This is not good.

01:24:15.398 --> 01:24:17.356
Stop him! Yaagh!

01:24:25.364 --> 01:24:27.192
Katie,
just get the van!

01:24:30.326 --> 01:24:34.069
Yuri, wait.
You don't understand.

01:24:47.299 --> 01:24:48.648
Oh!

01:24:59.877 --> 01:25:02.227
Start the plane!

01:25:02.271 --> 01:25:03.794
For the love of God,
start the plane!

01:25:13.456 --> 01:25:14.587
Rrgh!

01:25:14.631 --> 01:25:16.328
[engine starts]

01:25:24.206 --> 01:25:25.598
Start the plane!

01:25:33.215 --> 01:25:34.390
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:25:34.433 --> 01:25:35.956
OK. You win.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.871
[panting]

01:25:37.915 --> 01:25:39.438
Uh...

01:25:48.491 --> 01:25:50.449
I give in.

01:25:50.493 --> 01:25:51.624
[pipe clatters]

01:25:51.668 --> 01:25:52.843
Uh!

01:25:52.886 --> 01:25:55.454
[tires screech]

01:25:55.498 --> 01:25:57.282
[coughing]

01:26:01.678 --> 01:26:04.507
Just remember Katie.

01:26:05.986 --> 01:26:07.814
Get in.

01:26:14.517 --> 01:26:17.302
[coughs]

01:26:18.347 --> 01:26:19.826
Remember.

01:26:19.870 --> 01:26:22.568
Remember Katie.
Please just remember Katie.

01:26:24.483 --> 01:26:26.529
Remember Katie.

01:26:58.778 --> 01:27:01.433
Ah! Uh!

01:27:02.695 --> 01:27:04.741
Maybe I lied to her...

01:27:16.405 --> 01:27:20.060
but soon, she'll
remember everything.

01:27:20.104 --> 01:27:22.715
She'll know.

01:27:29.548 --> 01:27:32.986
She'll remember the speed
and aggressiveness

01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:36.251
in which the Hive
spread everywhere.

01:27:56.923 --> 01:28:00.710
She'll remember the last
holdouts of humanity falling.

01:28:02.973 --> 01:28:05.018
She'll remember the five days
that she spent

01:28:05.062 --> 01:28:09.414
locked up in the infirmary
starving to death

01:28:09.458 --> 01:28:12.722
waiting for me
to find my pocket

01:28:12.765 --> 01:28:14.593
so I could save us.

01:28:14.637 --> 01:28:18.031
She will realize that there's
nowhere for us to go,

01:28:18.075 --> 01:28:19.772
that I lied to her.

01:28:19.816 --> 01:28:23.428
Everything is not going
to be OK,

01:28:23.472 --> 01:28:26.301
but for now, she still has hope.

01:28:27.693 --> 01:28:31.697
Heh. Katie, you know,
she once told me

01:28:31.741 --> 01:28:34.657
that love is a false reality,

01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:37.007
and now I'm building her one.

01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:38.356
I...
