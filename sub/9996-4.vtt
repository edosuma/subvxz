00:00.600 --> 00:01.500
Got it.

00:02.000 --> 00:05.300
15-And-A-Half.
You're 15-And-A-Half. Okay.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.100
Honey, you know what?

00:07.100 --> 00:11.000
I am still at the supermarket
and it's 5:30.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.800
If i don't get off the phone
And get these groceries in the car,

00:13.800 --> 00:15.500
Daddy's going to beat me home.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.300
I promise.
We'll talk about it tonight.

27 Missed Calls

01:05.700 --> 01:06.500
Hello?

01:06.500 --> 01:10.300
Allison.Are you all right?
Where are you? Where have you been?

01:11.300 --> 01:13.500
I'm okay, i think.
My head hurts.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.700
My whole body hurts.

01:16.700 --> 01:19.300
- Is that mom? Is she okay?
- Where are you?

01:19.800 --> 01:21.100
I don't know.

01:22.300 --> 01:23.900
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

01:24.800 --> 01:26.900
I hear a freeway over my head.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.200
There's a street sign.
It says "181st street. "

01:30.200 --> 01:32.300
Okay, you stay right there.
I'm going to come and get you.

01:32.500 --> 01:35.000
I just need to call the police
and tell them that i found you.

01:35.500 --> 01:36.900
You called the police?

01:36.900 --> 01:39.800
Allison, you've been missing
for six hours.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.600
What happened to you?

01:43.700 --> 01:45.400
I have no idea.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.600
<b> <i>Medium
Season 05 - Episode 04
** About Last Night **</b></i>

02:32.900 --> 02:35.100
Okay, follow my finger.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.100
Can you tell me
the last thing you remember?

02:39.100 --> 02:41.400
i don't know.
I was leaving the supermarket.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.700
I was talking to my eldest
daughter on the phone.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.400
Well, let's start
with the good news.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.000
There's no evidence
of a concussion.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.800
No sign of sexual assault.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.600
But she lost six hours
of her life.

02:50.600 --> 02:54.300
I mean, she can't remember anything before
waking up In the middle of 181st street.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.000
I understand,
mr. Dubois,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.700
But i'm guessing something fairly traumatic Happened
during the time that she can't account for.

02:59.700 --> 03:05.400
And now the mind is doing what it can
To block out, or suppress,Those unpleasant memory.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.900
That's what it's built to do.

03:07.500 --> 03:08.800
So, what do we do now?

03:11.700 --> 03:15.000
Whatever happened tonight,
It'll come back to you eventually.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
There's nothing to deal
with until it does.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.300
Do you think the police
will find the car?

03:20.800 --> 03:22.000
I don't know.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.100
I don't care.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.300
I found you.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.800
Anything after that...

03:35.700 --> 03:37.200
<i>These are for you.</i>

03:38.500 --> 03:39.600
Pancakes?

03:39.600 --> 03:42.800
I have a bump on my head.
You didn't have to make me pancakes.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.500
Well, we missed you
and we were scared for you.

03:45.500 --> 03:48.800
And we just wanted to make you
something special.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.200
So you got daddy
to make me pancakes?

03:51.200 --> 03:53.000
It was the least
we could do.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.300
So, uh, how does it feel?
The bump, i mean.

03:56.500 --> 04:00.300
Not great, but nothing
that a pancake can't cure.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.300
Hey, what do you got there?

04:02.300 --> 04:05.900
Remember what i was telling you about yesterday?
About turning 15-And-A-Half?

04:07.100 --> 04:08.000
What is it?

04:08.600 --> 04:11.100
It's an application
for my learner's permit.

04:11.100 --> 04:13.000
I need you and dad
to sign it.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.100
Wait a second. There's got to be
some kind of mistake.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.300
Didn't i just take
the training wheels off your bike?

04:18.300 --> 04:20.700
Didn't you just learn
to ride a two-Wheeler?

04:20.700 --> 04:24.300
Can't believe my baby's actually
old enough To get behind the wheel.

04:24.300 --> 04:30.000
Wait. You mean, ariel's gonna drive? Like, a car?

04:32.100 --> 04:34.100
Here you sign this.
I'll get the door.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.300
Ouch.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.000
Good morning to you, too.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.800
Would you like a cup of coffee?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.200
We talked to everybody
We could find at the supermarket;

04:46.200 --> 04:48.200
no witnesses. Nobody saw anything.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.900
And they would've had to see something,
right? It was still daylight.

04:50.900 --> 04:52.400
Makes no sense.

04:52.400 --> 04:56.400
Notwithstanding The fact that you can't remember
anything From the time you approached your car.

04:56.800 --> 05:00.000
We're thinking that the attack must have}happened After you left that parking lot.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.800
But why would anyone attack me?

05:01.800 --> 05:05.300
It's not like i was carrying a lot of money.
It's not like i have a fancy car.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.000
Crime of opportunity?

05:07.300 --> 05:09.700
Some addict needed a couple
bucks and a ride to his dealer.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.100
You were at a traffic light.

05:11.100 --> 05:12.200
I'm just guessing.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.900
In any event, we've got
an apb out on your car,

05:13.900 --> 05:17.100
And your bank's checking your credit cards
To see if anybody used them last night.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.400
Beyond that,
until you remember something...

05:22.500 --> 05:24.600
That's quite A conking}you took on your noggin.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.700
If it were me,
i'd stay home for a day or two.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.300
Yeah, well, i don't have
a car at the moment,

05:28.300 --> 05:31.600
So i guess that's the plan,
whether i like it or not.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.000
Though i have plenty
to keep me busy

05:33.000 --> 05:34.800
I mean, My wallet being stolen,

05:34.800 --> 05:38.100
i've got to get A new driver's license,
new credit cards...

05:39.600 --> 05:42.600
Oh, lee? Hold on,
i want to show you something.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.300
It's not my handwriting.

05:45.300 --> 05:48.000
I don't know where it came from,
what it means.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.800
"1927 hennepin. " It should be
easy enough to check out.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.100
Hey, girls, we're
leaving in five minutes!

05:53.100 --> 05:54.800
Is ariel driving?!

05:55.400 --> 05:56.700
Don't ask.

06:16.700 --> 06:17.500
Hello?

06:17.600 --> 06:21.300
If i sent a squad car around for you,
Would you be willing to meet me at the morgue?

06:22.000 --> 06:24.600
Hit and run.
Happened sometime last night.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.500
Ask me where.

06:31.900 --> 06:33.000
Where?

06:33.500 --> 06:36.900
That address you gave me,
1927 hennepin.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.300
Name's diego molina,
undocumented alien.

06:40.900 --> 06:45.500
That, uh, lumberyard down the street Said
they used him as a day laborer from time to time.

06:46.600 --> 06:50.600
You don't happen to remember yet How that slip of
paper came to be in your pocket, do you?

06:51.700 --> 06:53.500
No, i wish i did.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.400
I'm completely baffled, lee.

06:57.400 --> 07:01.400
It was just... it was there
when i came to on the sidewalk.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.800
<i>You're not going
to believe this,</i>

07:03.800 --> 07:07.100
But i found myself
getting very excited today

07:07.100 --> 07:10.300
About the prospect of teaching
our eldest how to drive.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.700
- That stings.
- You'll get over it.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.900
I'll tell you what, you can teach bridgette
How to drive when she's old enough.

07:15.900 --> 07:18.300
I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about that goo

07:18.300 --> 07:21.500
That you're pressing on my forehead.
You're pushing too hard, it stings.

07:21.500 --> 07:22.600
Sorry.

07:23.400 --> 07:28.400
<i>And i'm afraid band-Aid wise
All we have in the house is spongebob.</i>

07:28.400 --> 07:30.600
- Are you kidding?
- No, i know.

07:30.600 --> 07:34.300
<i>You'd like a kim possible band-Aid,
But we're all out.</i>

07:34.800 --> 07:36.300
So you're okay with it?

07:37.400 --> 07:40.800
- With what?
- If i take her
driving first?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.700
I guess so.
I don't even have a car at the moment.

07:44.100 --> 07:45.600
It's just
there's something about it.

07:45.600 --> 07:50.100
You know, a father teaching
his kid how to drive.

07:51.500 --> 07:55.600
I let you have the birds and the bees
And all of that female hygiene stuff.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.900
- Oh, you let me have that?
- You know what i mean.

07:57.900 --> 08:01.700
No, no, no. If there's been something
You've been dying to tell her about,

08:01.700 --> 08:05.200
I don't know, pads
or flow or bloating...

08:05.200 --> 08:07.600
- Okay, you're playing dirty now.
- No, i'm sure she'd love to hear from you,

08:07.600 --> 08:09.400
Given your vast experience.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.600
Okay. I'm going to sleep now.

08:11.800 --> 08:16.000
Maybe i could do a little studying up
And teach one of the young'uns uh, yeah.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.900
About how there's different
peddles on the car,

08:17.900 --> 08:21.200
- And one makes one go, one makes one stop.
- Okay. Good night now.

08:21.200 --> 08:25.700
- You know, a mom can always dream, right?
- I can't hear you, sleeping.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.400
Oh, my...

08:41.900 --> 08:43.100
Why?

08:45.100 --> 08:46.400
Why?

08:49.400 --> 08:51.900
Look at what i've done.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.200
It's all my fault.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.300
He knew me!

09:01.400 --> 09:05.000
He looked up at me
and he asked, "why?"

09:05.300 --> 09:06.600
Are you listening?

09:07.000 --> 09:11.500
Hey! Hey, it's 2:00 in the morning.
Why are you splashing water on your face?

09:12.700 --> 09:16.800
My wife just woke me up to tell me That
she thinks that she might've killed a man.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.800
I guess i just wanted to be
really sure that i was awake,

09:19.800 --> 09:22.000
That i was really hearing right.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.200
What is that?

09:23.500 --> 09:26.400
I hate that!
The way you talk to me.

09:26.400 --> 09:30.300
I just told you.
I think i killed someone.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.300
And you're acting annoyed!

09:32.600 --> 09:34.800
Like, "why are you making
all this trouble?

09:34.800 --> 09:37.600
Why are you making
my life so complicated?"

09:37.600 --> 09:40.400
Hold on, i'm not annoyed,
but i am skeptical.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.500
And i guess i don't understand
why you're not.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.000
What is there to be
skeptical about?

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
The doctor said that i...
I'd probably experienced a traumatic event.

09:49.000 --> 09:57.400
Well, i can't imagine anything more traumatic
Than mowing another human being over with my car.

09:57.400 --> 10:00.700
All right, allison, But you can't be
absolutely certain that you did it.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.800
It's not like you saw yourself
mow him down.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.800
I don't need to see it!

10:06.200 --> 10:10.700
Obviously, i'm being spared
From seeing it.

10:10.700 --> 10:12.200
- Maybe.
- "Maybe"?

10:12.200 --> 10:14.800
I don't know, allison. Why would you
be chasing a man with your car?

10:14.800 --> 10:17.100
I mean, doesn't that sound a
little out of character for you?

10:17.100 --> 10:19.000
I... i-I need to call devalos.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.100
I think there's a really good
chance that i did this.

10:22.100 --> 10:24.700
I think there's a really good
chance that you did not.

10:24.700 --> 10:28.200
Allison, for god's sake,
you went through so much The other night.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.800
We all went through
so much the other night.

10:30.800 --> 10:34.100
Can't we please, just this once,
take a breath?!

10:34.600 --> 10:37.800
Okay, before you turn
your whole life upside down?

10:37.800 --> 10:41.600
Before you turn all of our lives
upside down?

10:41.800 --> 10:45.000
Okay, let's just wait And see
if the police find your car.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.400
See if there's some witnesses Who might be
able to shed some light on what happened?

10:49.600 --> 10:53.600
Something other than two
disconnected dreams?

11:11.700 --> 11:12.900
Thank you.

11:19.700 --> 11:21.600
Sorry it took so long. Traffic.

11:21.600 --> 11:26.500
I asked the officer if he could, you know,
Run the siren, but he ignored me.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.700
I filled manny in
on what happened The other night.

11:28.700 --> 11:31.800
Your, uh, missing six hours and all.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.700
Your bank
finally called.

11:33.700 --> 11:37.300
Turns out there was some credit card activity
On your account the night you were attacked.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.400
Wait a second. Somebody used my credit cards?

11:39.400 --> 11:40.800
Do they know who?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.300
Actually, they do.

11:42.800 --> 11:48.600
This is a security camera tape From one of those big box
home improvement stores, Builder's bonanza.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.900
Look familiar?

11:50.400 --> 11:51.500
Not really.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.100
At 8:34,
two days ago,

11:53.100 --> 11:56.700
You, allison dubois,
Went shopping at builder's bonanza.

11:56.700 --> 11:57.600
You kidding?

11:58.200 --> 11:59.700
What did i buy?

11:59.800 --> 12:07.200
Apparently, you purchased A 27-Inch hand saw
And a 12-Pack of ziplock bags.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.500
I have absolutely
no recollection of this.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.300
That's the merchant's copy
of the receipt you signed.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.600
This is weird.
Doesn't even look like my handwriting.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.000
Allison, obviously
that's you on the tape.

12:24.300 --> 12:28.000
Okay, i'm guessing
that we're a lot
more excited About this than you are.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.200
I mean, we don't have any footage
Of you getting hit on the head,

12:30.200 --> 12:32.600
But it's got to be a relief to know
That for at least part of that time,

12:32.600 --> 12:34.600
You were just shopping.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.700
Well, i suppose so.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
And i know we haven't
found your car just yet,

12:39.000 --> 12:43.900
But, uh, the fact that at least up until just
before 9:00 You were still using your credit card

12:43.900 --> 12:48.100
Leads me to think that when we do find your car,
We might even find your purse still safely inside it.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.600
Who knows? Maybe
you weren't attacked at all.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.900
Maybe something fell
on you, knocked you out.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.800
Your car was parked safely
around the corner,

12:55.800 --> 13:00.600
And now it's sitting in a tow yard somewhere
Because you ran out of time on the meter.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.900
Ariel.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.100
I got to pick up your sisters
in about 25 minutes.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.300
How about a driving lesson
in the meantime?

13:12.400 --> 13:13.400
Really?

13:13.700 --> 13:15.000
Okay, now... whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.400
Before you take off the brake,
Before you put it in gear,

13:17.400 --> 13:18.500
Let's have a little chat.

13:18.600 --> 13:21.900
Okay, now, listen, sweetie, nobody likes
To be told what to do or how to do things,

13:21.900 --> 13:25.700
All right, but when it comes to driving,
I've been doing this for 20 years, okay?

13:25.900 --> 13:26.800
I know, dad.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.700
All right, So if i ask you to do
something, you got to do it.

13:28.700 --> 13:31.500
Don't even think about it,
don't talk about it, just do it.

13:31.500 --> 13:36.400
This is almost 3,000 pounds of machinery
That we're sitting in here, so...

13:36.400 --> 13:38.000
And like i said, i've been
doing this for 20 years.

13:38.000 --> 13:38.800
Okay, dad.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.800
Okay, so if i tell you
to slow down, slow down.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.500
If i tell you to turn
the wheel, turn the wheel.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.400
If i tell you to hit
the brake, you hit the brake.

13:44.700 --> 13:48.100
Afterwards, when we're parked,
We can talk about anything you'd like,

13:48.100 --> 13:50.700
But while we're on the road,
i'm the boss, okay?

13:50.700 --> 13:52.900
- You're the boss, dad.
- Okay, all right, pumpkin.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.400
Okay, so mirrors are adjusted.
Seat belts are on.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.100
Mirrors adjusted,
seat belts on.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.200
Good, okay, so now...

13:59.200 --> 14:00.800
- Take off the emergency brake...
-  emergency brake.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.400
- Move the gearshift to "d."
- Gearshift into "d."

14:02.400 --> 14:03.900
- Put your left...
- lift my foot off the brake.

14:03.900 --> 14:06.000
- Right.
- Gently apply it to the accelerator,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.800
Turn the wheel and enter
the flow of traffic.

14:12.100 --> 14:12.900
That's good,
that's good.

14:12.900 --> 14:13.800
- You...
- sorry.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.200
No, no, no, that's good. You know..
you know just what to do.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.100
<i>Let's play...
"Who's the psychic?"</i>

14:23.600 --> 14:24.600
Pardon me?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.700
Who's the psychic, you or me?

14:26.800 --> 14:29.900
I'm sorry, i have no idea
what you're talking about.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.200
Well, wasn't i the one
Who said that your car is just fine,

14:32.200 --> 14:34.900
Probably sitting
in an impound lot somewhere?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.900
What are you saying?
What are you trying to tell me?

14:36.900 --> 14:40.300
City impound just called
Looking for you- Here's the address.

14:40.300 --> 14:42.100
The "n" bus
will take you right to it.

14:42.100 --> 14:43.700
Oh, my god, this
is wonderful news.

14:43.700 --> 14:46.100
Didn't you say you thought that
your purse was still in the car?

14:46.600 --> 14:49.100
They're gonna want 160 bucks.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.100
I don't, uh...

14:50.100 --> 14:51.500
Pay me back tomorrow.

14:51.500 --> 14:52.600
<i>I don't get it.</i>

14:53.200 --> 14:56.400
What is there to get?
It was the most frustrating experience.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.200
No, honey, i'm not talking about
you Teaching ariel to drive.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.800
I'm talking
about this.

15:02.300 --> 15:05.900
I mean, look at it.
There is not a mark on it.

15:06.100 --> 15:09.200
Look, there's not
a ding or a dent.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.700
There's not a dent or a ding

15:10.700 --> 15:14.400
Because it wasn't involved In any kind
of a collision with a human being

15:14.400 --> 15:16.100
Or with anything else
for that matter.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.000
And that's good news,
by the way.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.200
Yeah, it is...

15:19.200 --> 15:23.200
i guess the reason That i never actually
saw the accident Is the accident
never happened.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.000
That's the theory i'm embracing.

15:25.600 --> 15:28.900
Just wish i knew where my purse was.
It was in that security video,

15:28.900 --> 15:30.700
And i was hoping it
would be in the car.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.400
I would barely have time to
think Of something to say to her,

15:34.400 --> 15:36.200
And she would already
be saying it to me.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.400
Oh, i'm sorry. I know how much you
Were looking forward to teaching her.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.400
- That doesn't sound like fun.
- It wasn't.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.900
It was no fun at
all, not for me.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.500
Well, how did she do?

15:46.500 --> 15:49.200
She did fine.
She's a very good driver.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.400
She did everything that
i would want her to.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.300
That's what matters,
isn't it?

15:54.300 --> 15:55.700
I suppose.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.200
You know what's funny?

16:01.400 --> 16:04.400
Whenever i'm in a good mood about something,
Something's getting to you.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.900
What, you mean you're
gonna let a small thing

16:05.900 --> 16:08.800
Like discovering you didn't kill a man
With your car lighten your mood?

16:29.400 --> 16:31.000
hey, babe. Honey?

16:33.200 --> 16:35.500
- What's going on?
- Hey.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.800
What are you doing?
Why aren't you in bed?

16:37.800 --> 16:39.900
I had a dream- I saw
where my purse turned up.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.000
It's inside this
garbage dumpster.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.300
I want to go and get it
before someone else finds it

16:44.300 --> 16:46.700
Or the garbage people come
and take the dumpster away.

16:46.700 --> 16:48.700
That's if i'm not
already too late.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.800
What? Wait a second.
Where is this dumpster?

16:51.800 --> 16:54.000
Did this dumpster
come with an address?

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
It all happened outside this
trucking office downtown.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.100
I got the address
from the phone book.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.400
Allison,
it's 4:00 in the morning.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.400
I know, that's why
i got to get going.

17:03.400 --> 17:06.700
I just... i didn't want you
To wake up and not know where i was.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.700
I'll be back for breakfast.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.800
Usually, when we try to
figure out who someone is,

17:56.800 --> 17:59.400
We have to get them in here,
Fingerprint them, run the prints.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.900
This method you've come up with
Of not bringing the whole person in-

18:02.900 --> 18:05.400
Just the part we need- It's genius.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.900
Name's maria vargas.

18:07.900 --> 18:10.400
Lucky for us, she was brought in
On a dul a couple years ago,

18:10.400 --> 18:12.800
so her prints And her picture
are in the system.

18:12.900 --> 18:14.400
Maria vargas.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.700
I have no idea
who this woman is.

18:17.700 --> 18:18.800
No reason you should.

18:19.100 --> 18:20.600
She's a bookkeeper...
or she was.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.100
Worked for a company called
green highway trucking.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.000
Green highway trucking.
I know... i know that name.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.700
I've been there.
I was there that night.

18:32.700 --> 18:35.100
I can't be sure,
but i think it was...

18:35.100 --> 18:37.900
After i bought that saw
And that box of baggies.

18:38.300 --> 18:39.500
Scanlon.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.600
That's what i call timing.

18:45.600 --> 18:49.300
We had an address on maria,
So i asked a patrolman to swing By her place.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.700
- Was she there?
- Oh, yeah.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.800
Apparently, she's
been waiting for us.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.400
I had her hand in my purse.

19:07.900 --> 19:11.400
I... bought a saw.}I bought baggies.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.500
Yeah, but is your
name hector alvarez?

19:13.800 --> 19:16.100
- Who's hector alvarez?
- I have no idea.

19:16.100 --> 19:19.600
But the victim here Was discovered
conveniently clutching this note.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.500
"Hector alvarez
did this to me. "

19:22.700 --> 19:23.800
What do you think?

19:23.800 --> 19:25.700
That's not my handwriting.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.200
I don't even know
a hector alvarez.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.600
My point precisely.

19:30.100 --> 19:34.400
Am i supposed to believe That maria
wrote that note before she died?

19:34.900 --> 19:37.000
I know. Be a pretty neat
trick, right?

19:37.400 --> 19:39.600
There's not a spot of
blood on this paper.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.700
Can i make a suggestion?
Get out of here.Let us do our work.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.700
By tonight, we should
know an awful lot more.

19:46.700 --> 19:49.300
I'll give you a shout,
fill you in.

19:56.900 --> 19:57.900
Hi, dad.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.400
Want to practice driving?

20:03.000 --> 20:07.300
Oh, god, you know, honey,
Uh, i just got home.

20:07.300 --> 20:08.800
Uh, maybe mommy...

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Mom's waiting for a phone call.

20:11.300 --> 20:12.800
Oh, okay.

20:13.200 --> 20:16.700
Uh, wait, isn't your learner's permit
No good after the sun sets?

20:16.700 --> 20:19.300
'Cause... it's pretty much set.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.900
I mean, there's always
the weekend, okay?

20:22.800 --> 20:25.500
Kind of get the feeling you
don't like driving with me.

20:25.500 --> 20:26.800
No.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.600
I was just telling mom what
a good driver you are.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.500
How you just seem to...

20:33.300 --> 20:34.800
You just know.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.700
Is that the same as liking
to drive with me?

20:40.900 --> 20:42.900
Look, ariel, i don't know
where you get this idea from.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.500
I love driving with you.

20:44.500 --> 20:48.400
I mean, we've only been out driving
That one time, but i loved it.

20:48.600 --> 20:51.300
And... you know, i just...

20:51.300 --> 20:53.100
I don't think we should go
out tonight, 'cause i...

20:53.100 --> 20:55.400
You know, i don't want you
to get in any trouble,

20:55.400 --> 20:58.700
But if you want to get
up, you know, early,

20:58.700 --> 21:00.900
Say, 6:30 tomorrow morning...

21:01.500 --> 21:02.600
You mean it?

21:02.600 --> 21:04.000
Sure, i mean it.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.300
I wouldn't be offering
if i didn't mean it.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.200
I love driving with you.

21:10.300 --> 21:14.100
Oh, daddy, i was just so worried
You hated driving with me.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.300
Don't be ridiculous.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.200
Hello?

21:20.200 --> 21:22.200
You want the good news
or the bad news?

21:22.200 --> 21:23.600
There's bad news?

21:23.600 --> 21:25.000
I'll start with the good.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.800
The medical examiner feels it's highly
unlikely You killed that young woman.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.300
Highly unlikely?

21:30.300 --> 21:32.500
Yeah, remember that candlestick
she was beaten to death with?

21:32.500 --> 21:34.500
Well, judging from the angle
Of the blows, they're guessing

21:34.500 --> 21:37.600
That the person who killed maria vargas
Was about a foot taller than she was.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.500
Taller?
'Cause i'm only five-Two.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.500
Yeah, i know.
Not tall.

21:42.900 --> 21:45.200
Also, they feel very strongly
that the killer was left-Handed.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.400
You're a righty, right?

21:46.400 --> 21:47.900
All my life, i swear.

21:48.500 --> 21:52.800
Also, they're telling me It would take enormous Strength
to inflict That kind of damage on another human being.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.500
No offense, but none of this
Sounds like allison dubois to me.

21:55.900 --> 21:57.300
No offense taken.

21:57.500 --> 22:00.200
Oh, and the name on that note:
uh, hector alvarez?

22:00.900 --> 22:04.400
Well, it rang no bells with me
Or anyone else over at police headquarters.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.600
I checked with your boss.}He never heard of him, either.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.100
The fbi is apparently
very familiar with this guy,

22:09.100 --> 22:13.400
And one of their best and brightest Is in there
right now bringing manny up to speed.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.000
He suggested i call you

22:15.000 --> 22:17.400
and make sure You could be down here
first thing in the morning

22:17.400 --> 22:18.900
So we can bring you up to speed.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.900
I'll be there.
I'll definitely be there.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.400
So, what's the bad news?

22:23.400 --> 22:25.600
Well, you know that note
with alvarez's name on it-

22:25.600 --> 22:28.200
- The one the dead girl was clutching?
- Yeah.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.200
Your fingerprints are all over it.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.700
How is that possible?

22:31.700 --> 22:33.100
I have no idea.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.300
but, hey,
look on the bright side.

22:35.300 --> 22:37.300
There's no law
against leaving notes.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.000
Who are you, and what
are you doing in my office?

23:22.500 --> 23:24.100
Why are you just sitting there?

23:24.400 --> 23:27.000
You're not concerned
that i might call the police?

23:32.300 --> 23:33.900
Oh, hector,

23:34.300 --> 23:37.900
the only thing I'm not concerned about
is you calling the police.

23:37.900 --> 23:40.000
I don't know who you are
and what you want,

23:40.600 --> 23:42.500
But if you don't tell me
what you're doing here...

23:44.300 --> 23:45.600
What are you going to do,

23:45.900 --> 23:47.300
Shoot me, hector?

23:47.900 --> 23:50.500
We both know that would be
a big waste of your time.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.300
What are you talking about?

23:53.700 --> 23:54.800
Who are you?

23:55.700 --> 23:57.200
I'll give you a hint.

23:58.800 --> 24:01.400
You killed me earlier tonight.

24:34.400 --> 24:37.500
Allison, it's barely 5:00 a. M.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.100
I had it all wrong.

24:39.200 --> 24:40.900
I didn't lose those six hours
the other night.

24:40.900 --> 24:42.500
They were taken from me.

24:42.500 --> 24:46.000
Oh, allison, i have no idea
What you're talking about.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.700
Maria vargas- That woman}who was killed
by hector alvarez.

24:49.700 --> 24:51.000
The moment that she died,

24:51.000 --> 24:52.900
Something important must have
been happening in her life.

24:52.900 --> 24:54.800
Something
that she needed to finish.

24:54.900 --> 24:56.900
I think she used me to do it.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.500
She hijacked me.

24:59.500 --> 25:03.400
I'm guessing that it-It happened
That moment in the parking lot

25:03.400 --> 25:05.600
Right after i put the groceries
in the car.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.900
Yeah, i promise.
We'll talk about it tonight.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.400
Excuse me, miss?

25:26.700 --> 25:28.200
Are you all right?

25:29.900 --> 25:31.000
Miss?

25:34.400 --> 25:37.900
Oh, yes, i'm fine.
Thanks.

25:39.700 --> 25:43.700
<i>So... lost in thought.
She had a whole agenda.</i>

25:43.800 --> 25:46.200
<i>It started with me going
in that hardware store.</i>

25:46.300 --> 25:49.300
Buying that saw,
that box of baggies.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.400
And then sawing off her own hand

25:54.400 --> 25:58.400
So i could use her fingerprints
To gain access to her computer.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.400
Wow.

25:59.400 --> 26:03.000
That sounds like a
pretty grisly six hours.

26:03.100 --> 26:05.300
Yeah. And i left out the part

26:05.300 --> 26:08.700
where i stabbed a man In the chest
with a pair of scissors.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.900
All of it to get this phone number
That i put in here.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.600
This number.

26:17.500 --> 26:20.600
You have any idea whose
number that might be?

26:22.100 --> 26:24.000
Okay, well there's only
one way to find out.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
No. Joe, it's 5:08
in the morning.

26:28.200 --> 26:31.600
We're sorry, the number you have reached
is no longer in service.

26:31.800 --> 26:34.700
Please check the number
or try your call again.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.200
I- I don't get it.
??

26:41.200 --> 26:44.900
I mean, why would i go to all that trouble
If it's not even a working number?

26:44.900 --> 26:46.800
I- I don't get it.

26:46.800 --> 26:50.300
You know, allison, um,
i got to get up

26:50.300 --> 26:53.500
And-And go driving with ariel
in an hour.

26:53.900 --> 26:56.100
What say we try
to get a little more sleep?

26:56.100 --> 26:59.400
Maybe it will make more sense
when the sun comes up.

27:00.600 --> 27:03.500
Now, put the key
in the... and turn it.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.900
Now, turn on your...

27:05.400 --> 27:06.400
Blinker.

27:06.700 --> 27:08.200
Now... yeah.

27:08.300 --> 27:09.900
Just pull away from the curb.

27:19.500 --> 27:20.900
Is something wrong, dad?

27:20.900 --> 27:22.000
You're kidding, right?

27:22.900 --> 27:24.600
You know the answer
to that question.

27:24.600 --> 27:28.200
Probably knew the answer to it Before i even
had a chance to consider the question.

27:41.300 --> 27:42.900
Okay, you can go now.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.400
Ariel, you came
to a full stop.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.000
Now you have to go
through the intersection.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.700
- Ariel, i want you to go through...
- I know what you want me to do.

27:53.100 --> 27:54.400
That's the problem, isn't it?

27:54.400 --> 27:56.200
I know what you want me
to do before you say it.

27:56.200 --> 27:57.700
Well, i'm sorry, but i do.

27:57.700 --> 28:00.400
And why is that
such a bad thing?}Why do you hate this?

28:00.400 --> 28:02.000
- I don't hate this.
- Hate being with me.

28:02.400 --> 28:05.600
You know,
mom told me
To try and talk less, but still.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.900
Okay, i'm sorry, sweetie.

28:06.900 --> 28:09.100
You know,
it doesn't matter, okay?

28:09.100 --> 28:11.000
You still act all mad.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.800
Like this driving thing is for you,
And i'm letting you down.

28:13.800 --> 28:16.400
But it's not, it's for me,
and you're letting me down.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.300
I know, i know it is.

28:17.300 --> 28:21.300
So too bad if it's not going The way you
pictured it With your 20-Year experience.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.700
When i'm sitting in class With the
driving teacher sitting next to me,

28:27.600 --> 28:29.700
I'M not trying
to get in his head.

28:29.900 --> 28:33.300
I'm thinking, what Would my dad do,
what would my dad say?

28:35.100 --> 28:37.500
God, am i stupid!

28:38.300 --> 28:40.500
You are not stupid.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.100
Sweetie.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.000
Sweetie, you're not stupid.
I'm so sorry.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.600
Yeah. I know.
Move through the intersection.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.500
You guys are all right?

29:04.500 --> 29:05.700
Oh, god.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.100
That's my fault.
I totally didn't...

29:07.100 --> 29:10.400
no, no. You know what? I didn't look,
either, to be honest with you.

29:10.600 --> 29:12.600
Maybe it was my fault.

29:13.700 --> 29:14.700
You know what?

29:14.700 --> 29:17.000
- Let's not mention this to mom.
- Let's not mention this to mom.

29:24.700 --> 29:26.600
We're sorry, but the number
you just...

29:33.700 --> 29:35.900
- We're sorry, but the number you...
- I'm sorry. Am i, uh,

29:36.100 --> 29:37.200
Catching you at a bad time?

29:37.200 --> 29:39.000
No, no, no, no. No.
I'm here for you.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Detective scanlon told me
I should come in early this morning.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.600
You would fill me
in on the hector-Alvarez case.

29:44.600 --> 29:47.800
Okay. I'm filling you in.}The case is all but closed.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.100
What?

29:49.100 --> 29:51.000
The fbi just called.
They found him.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.400
They're holding him over at
casa valley memorial hospital.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.900
I was just about
to run over there.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.400
You expecting a phone call?

30:00.400 --> 30:03.000
Oh, it's nothing. It's just... just...

30:03.700 --> 30:07.400
I'm sorry.
Uh, fbi, hector alvarez?

30:07.500 --> 30:09.500
Hector alvarez.

30:09.500 --> 30:12.000
Turns out to be a very interesting fellow.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.200
This green highway
trucking he owns?

30:15.500 --> 30:16.900
They're in the short-Haul
Trucking business,

30:16.900 --> 30:19.700
or so he'd have people believe.
According to the fbi,

30:19.700 --> 30:23.600
Mr. Alvarez's real business
is human trafficking.

30:23.600 --> 30:26.700
Sneaking illegal immigrants
across the border For a hefty fee.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.100
He was a coyote?

30:29.500 --> 30:31.500
Maria vargas worked
for a coyote?

30:31.500 --> 30:33.700
Well, i'm sure she told herself
she was doing a good thing.

30:33.700 --> 30:36.500
Helping people with no futures,
no jobs, get to a place

30:36.500 --> 30:39.300
Where they can earn
some money, help their families.

30:39.300 --> 30:42.500
But this fellow alvarez.

30:42.500 --> 30:46.600
Apparently, the bureau has been trying
To build a case against him for years,

30:46.900 --> 30:48.800
But they've never been able
To prove anything.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.000
Now, with the murder
of maria vargas,

30:53.000 --> 30:54.700
All that may change.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.400
How long has he been here?

31:01.300 --> 31:02.900
How did he get here?

31:03.400 --> 31:06.700
Apparently, he drove himself.
Two nights ago.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.800
- Stab wound.
- Through the heart.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.700
Is this something
you dreamt about?

31:13.700 --> 31:14.800
I...

31:15.100 --> 31:20.600
I think this might be something i did.
I mean, it was maria doing it,

31:20.600 --> 31:24.100
But still, i think it
might have been my body,

31:24.300 --> 31:27.500
My hand that put
those scissors in him.

31:27.900 --> 31:30.700
Allison, i'm not sure
i understand.

31:30.700 --> 31:32.800
I think from the
second that maria died,

31:32.900 --> 31:35.400
Until i woke up
under that overpass,

31:35.400 --> 31:37.900
Maria appropriated my body

31:38.500 --> 31:41.800
So she could do something,
finish something.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.600
But i-I don't know what.

31:45.700 --> 31:47.300
Is he going to
be all right?

31:48.100 --> 31:49.700
Well, they don't know for sure.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.100
He apparently bled so much
On the drive over

31:52.100 --> 31:55.300
that he passed out on the curb
In front of the emergency room.

31:55.300 --> 31:58.200
By the time they got him
up here, he was in this coma.

31:59.100 --> 32:00.800
What happens now?

32:01.600 --> 32:03.700
- We wait.
- Till what?

32:03.700 --> 32:05.100
Till he comes out of it.

32:05.500 --> 32:08.400
At which time he'll be charged
with the death of maria vargas.

32:09.000 --> 32:13.300
His clothing, in addition to being soaked
In his own blood, was speckled with maria's.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.100
No one was looking for yours.

32:22.600 --> 32:25.600
<i>Who was that sitting there
Next to him by the bed?</i>

32:25.700 --> 32:28.400
I was told that's his son,
desiderio.

32:29.500 --> 32:31.000
He has a son?

32:32.400 --> 32:35.400
Allison, i can see That you're
torturing yourself about this, but

32:35.600 --> 32:38.000
Even if you did do what you
think you might have done,

32:38.300 --> 32:40.600
It would have clearly
been in self-Defense.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.800
Not to mention the fact that
you weren't in your right mind.

32:42.800 --> 32:45.200
Maybe not
in your own mind at all.

32:47.600 --> 32:50.800
<i>I agree with your boss.
It was self-Defense.</i>

32:51.100 --> 32:54.000
And it wasn't even you who did it.
I mean, not really.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.800
What if he dies?

32:57.300 --> 32:59.900
What are you asking me?
Are you responsible?

33:00.300 --> 33:04.200
No. I don't think you're responsible.
You were defending yourself.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.400
I mean, not even yourself.

33:08.300 --> 33:09.900
And what if it goes to trial?

33:10.600 --> 33:12.300
How do i make sense
of this to a jury?

33:12.300 --> 33:14.000
I can't even make sense
of this to myself.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.700
For A woman that i have never met
has taken over my body

33:17.700 --> 33:19.800
So she can get a number
from a computer

33:19.800 --> 33:21.900
For a phone
that doesn't even work.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.000
Shh.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
You're making yourself crazy
Over something that may never happen.

33:28.700 --> 33:30.900
Shut your eyes.
Try and get some rest.

33:37.600 --> 33:39.800
Diego, listen to me.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.000
People are going to die.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.700
Yes, i'm frightened.

33:45.300 --> 33:48.000
I think he knows i heard him
on the phone

33:48.000 --> 33:51.200
And i think he's worried
i might call the police.

33:53.800 --> 33:56.700
But how can i not call them?
I have to call them.

33:59.400 --> 34:02.200
Well, can't you come over here?
Be with me?

34:03.300 --> 34:06.900
It's almost 5:30,
aren't you done with work yet?

34:08.199 --> 34:09.500
Yeah, i'll pick you up.

34:10.500 --> 34:11.699
Where are you?

34:12.400 --> 34:14.900
1927...

34:15.600 --> 34:16.800
Hennepin.

34:18.900 --> 34:20.900
1927 hennepin.
Got it.

34:21.400 --> 34:22.900
I'll be right there, darling.

34:30.300 --> 34:34.300
It's really not nice to eavesdrop
When people are on the phone, maria.

34:36.400 --> 34:37.900
I guess we're even now.

34:39.900 --> 34:43.900
You would actually call the police After all
the years that we've been working together?

34:44.199 --> 34:46.000
How did you get in here?

34:49.300 --> 34:53.100
But don't worry, i'll... I'll put it
back under the mat when i leave.

34:55.699 --> 34:59.100
Maria, what would you
have me do?

34:59.700 --> 35:03.100
I don't know, But you just
can't leave them there to die.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.000
I have no choice.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.300
I got a tip.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.900
That's not just another truck
Full of peasants from el salvador.

35:10.300 --> 35:12.600
There's an undercover fbi
agent traveling with them,

35:12.600 --> 35:14.000
Pretending to be
one of them.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.800
Yeah, but what about the other 18
innocent people, Women and children?

35:17.800 --> 35:19.900
You're just gonna leave them
in the middle of the desert?

35:19.900 --> 35:21.300
Leave them to just die?

35:21.300 --> 35:22.900
Of course they have to die.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.700
I mean, what choice
do i have?

35:24.800 --> 35:26.600
- Hector...
- they have to die.

35:28.400 --> 35:29.800
You have to die.

35:57.800 --> 36:00.300
"1927 hennepin. "

36:02.900 --> 36:04.800
Don't worry about your friend.

36:05.100 --> 36:06.800
I'll give him a ride.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.100
It's ten after 7:00.
Here i am.

36:21.100 --> 36:22.800
I hope it's important.

36:23.100 --> 36:25.700
Four days ago,
some time before 5:30,

36:25.700 --> 36:29.600
Maria vargas overheard her boss,
hector alvarez, receive a tip.

36:30.300 --> 36:34.400
An fbi agent, Posing as
an unemployed el salvadorian,

36:34.400 --> 36:37.400
Was in one of hector's trucks.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.200
His sole purpose for
going to the u.S.

36:39.200 --> 36:43.200
Was To expose and arrest hector
for human trafficking.

36:43.500 --> 36:44.600
Okay.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.900
Hector knew maria knew
what he was up to,

36:48.100 --> 36:49.400
So he killed her.

36:49.700 --> 36:52.400
- Which is when you believe she...
- Possessed me.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.600
She... she needed me.

36:55.100 --> 36:58.600
She knew. Hector had already
contacted that driver.

36:58.600 --> 37:01.900
He had already instructed
him to empty the truck,

37:01.900 --> 37:03.900
To dump everyone there.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.700
Everyone, including that fbi agent,
To leave them to die in the desert.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.800
Maria wanted to help those people.

37:11.300 --> 37:13.900
To get to them.
To save them.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.700
But she didn't know
where they were.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.700
She had to be able to
contact the driver.

37:17.700 --> 37:20.200
She had to get the number
off the computer.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.400
- Which you got.
- Which i got.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.700
And which is no good.

37:27.100 --> 37:28.100
- let me see.
- We're sorry,

37:28.100 --> 37:29.900
the number you have reached is not in service.

37:29.900 --> 37:31.600
I dreamt about her
last night.

37:31.700 --> 37:33.500
I saw her die.

37:33.600 --> 37:36.700
She has to be showing me
This still for a reason.

37:36.900 --> 37:40.500
So we're thinking that these people
Are still be out there somewhere, alive?

37:40.600 --> 37:43.000
Allison, it's been four days.

37:45.900 --> 37:48.900
I'll call the fbi.
And i'll check out this number.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.100
Thank you.

38:03.700 --> 38:05.000
We've been summoned.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.600
According to the phoenix
field office of the fbi,

38:10.600 --> 38:14.600
Agent marco navarro was supposed to infiltrate
a truckload Of illegals out of el salvador.

38:15.300 --> 38:17.200
No one's heard from him
for four days.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.200
Oh, my god.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.600
They now have helicopters Searching

38:19.600 --> 38:23.400
the area around route 86,
Route 85, and interstate 19.

38:23.700 --> 38:25.400
Lot of empty space out there.

38:25.400 --> 38:27.600
Like looking for a needle
in a sand stack.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.800
And that number
you gave me-

38:29.800 --> 38:34.800
It was for a disposable cell phone, purchased for cash
From a convenience store here in downtown phoenix.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.300
Worthless as a clue.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.000
Everyone's doing the best
we can, allison.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.100
So, what about hector?

38:45.300 --> 38:46.700
He's still in his coma.

38:46.900 --> 38:50.200
I've had people check his office.
All the computers have been wiped clean.

38:50.700 --> 38:52.200
So, that's it?

38:52.400 --> 38:53.400
For now.

38:53.900 --> 38:57.300
Right now it's a matter
of time and luck.

38:57.300 --> 38:58.300
You should go home.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.000
There's nothing more to do here.

39:00.200 --> 39:01.700
I'll call you if
there's any news.

39:39.900 --> 39:41.100
Desiderio.

39:42.100 --> 39:43.300
Stop crying.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.600
I know what your father
told you to do.

39:47.200 --> 39:49.800
I need you to tell me
where you left them.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.600
Desiderio.

39:58.100 --> 39:59.800
Please.

40:14.100 --> 40:15.800
Desiderio.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.700
These are live pictures
of this breaking story.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.200
And if you're just tuning in,

40:20.200 --> 40:25.200
What you're looking at are fbi, USCIS,
And mexican federal agents...

40:25.800 --> 40:28.300
You look like someone who's been
up since 2:00 in the morning.

40:28.300 --> 40:33.100
...who were apparently left to die in the
desert Along the mexican-Arizona border...

40:33.100 --> 40:35.000
You saved a lot of lives.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.400
You and... desiderio.

40:40.500 --> 40:42.900
After you called, i phoned
over to the hospital.

40:42.900 --> 40:46.000
They said he was there,
Still watching over his comatose father.

40:46.400 --> 40:47.500
I went over.

40:47.500 --> 40:49.300
There wasn't a lot of conversation.

40:49.300 --> 40:52.100
He... clearly wanted to tell somebody.

40:52.100 --> 40:54.100
He was clearly tortured about it.

40:55.800 --> 40:58.300
Turns out he left them out there
with two cases of water,

40:58.300 --> 41:00.400
And a bag full
of candy bars.

41:00.400 --> 41:02.300
They're all still
alive, thank god.

41:07.800 --> 41:10.000
What about hector?

41:10.900 --> 41:13.200
Do i need to hire
an attorney?

41:15.300 --> 41:17.000
No, i think you're
in the clear.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.200
Sometime after i left,

41:21.900 --> 41:26.300
Desiderio held a pillow over his
father's face And smothered him to death.

41:27.100 --> 41:30.100
The agent guarding the room
was outside the door.Never heard a thing.

41:39.500 --> 41:40.800
Did you have
breakfast yet?

41:51.900 --> 41:54.500
So, what's new and exciting
in your life?

41:55.200 --> 41:58.700
Well, ariel, my oldest daughter,
Is learning to drive.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.600
Learning to drive?

42:01.305 --> 42:07.324
