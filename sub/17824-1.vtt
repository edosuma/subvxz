03:29.769 --> 03:30.770
Don't you think

03:30.978 --> 03:32.772
the most important
part of a meal

03:32.980 --> 03:33.814
is the wine?

03:34.023 --> 03:35.941
Everything must
follow the wine

03:36.150 --> 03:37.568
and in this case

03:37.777 --> 03:39.820
I could favor
a red Bordeaux.

03:40.029 --> 03:42.114
A red Bordeaux
at lunch?

03:43.240 --> 03:45.534
Your late husband would
never have approved.

04:42.967 --> 04:44.093
William?

04:44.552 --> 04:46.887
William, stay away
from the edge.

04:47.096 --> 04:48.597
The edge is no place to play.

04:48.806 --> 04:49.807
Yes, ma'am.

05:04.989 --> 05:06.615
What is it, William?

05:07.241 --> 05:08.617
I don't know.

05:18.836 --> 05:20.379
He's got a knife in his back.

05:42.151 --> 05:43.152
William!

05:44.403 --> 05:45.404
Watch where you're--

05:45.779 --> 05:46.780
William!

05:51.577 --> 05:52.578
Joseph, over there.

05:52.786 --> 05:53.621
Get down, Eden.

06:01.504 --> 06:02.505
Damn.

06:02.713 --> 06:03.714
Joseph!

06:21.315 --> 06:22.233
Oh!

07:18.664 --> 07:19.999
Leave us alone.
You hear?

07:20.332 --> 07:21.458
Get back.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.627
Leave us alone. Oh!

07:35.431 --> 07:36.432
Come, girl.

07:39.101 --> 07:40.019
Come on.

10:25.267 --> 10:26.518
I am the Raisuli.

10:26.894 --> 10:28.395
Do not laugh
at me again.

10:42.659 --> 10:44.620
<i>Secretary of State
to the President:</i>

10:44.828 --> 10:46.038
<i>I regret to inform you</i>

10:46.246 --> 10:48.081
<i>that I have received
the following dispatch</i>

10:48.290 --> 10:49.708
<i>from Samuel Gummere</i>

10:49.917 --> 10:52.044
<i>United States General Consul,
Tangier, Morocco.</i>

10:53.003 --> 10:54.004
<i>On October 15</i>

10:54.213 --> 10:56.173
<i>Mrs. Eden Pedecaris
and her children</i>

10:56.381 --> 10:58.550
<i>were kidnapped from
their residence in Tangier</i>

10:58.884 --> 11:01.428
<i>after the brutal murder
of her servants and a guest</i>

11:01.637 --> 11:04.264
<i>Sir Joshua Kenyon-Smith,
a British subject.</i>

11:05.307 --> 11:07.100
<i>This act of
barbarous criminality</i>

11:07.309 --> 11:09.645
<i>appears perpetrated
by Mulay el-Raisuli</i>

11:09.895 --> 11:11.522
<i>Sherif of the Riffian Berbers</i>

11:11.730 --> 11:13.440
<i>and the last of the
Barbary pirates.</i>

11:14.274 --> 11:15.943
<i>The British minister
and myself concur</i>

11:16.151 --> 11:18.111
<i>there exists alarming
prospects of danger</i>

11:18.320 --> 11:20.072
<i>for all foreigners in Morocco.</i>

11:20.697 --> 11:22.074
<i>Request warships.</i>

11:33.085 --> 11:35.629
Gentlemen, the presidency
was never won

11:35.838 --> 11:37.214
by a Vice President
filling out

11:37.422 --> 11:39.424
his fallen predecessor's
term of office.

11:39.633 --> 11:41.301
Now, that may not
obtain in this instance--

11:41.510 --> 11:43.929
The only thing that people will
remember about McKinley

11:44.137 --> 11:46.014
is he had the good sense
to get himself shot.

11:46.223 --> 11:48.475
Teddy's the most popular
President since Washington.

11:48.684 --> 11:50.060
Why drag in Washington?

11:51.603 --> 11:53.188
Ah, you know it,
and I know it

11:53.397 --> 11:55.399
but that damn cowboy
doesn't know it.

11:55.607 --> 11:59.194
What he wants is some issue
to hang his campaign on

11:59.403 --> 12:01.363
something to arouse
the populace.

12:01.780 --> 12:03.490
A cavalry charge?

12:03.907 --> 12:05.325
So to speak.

12:05.659 --> 12:06.618
Morocco?

12:07.494 --> 12:10.414
You know as well as I do we
can't have Arab desperadoes

12:10.664 --> 12:13.125
running around kidnapping
American citizens.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.919
If I had my way, I'd go in there
with a couple of Winchesters

12:16.128 --> 12:17.129
a battalion of Marines

12:17.337 --> 12:18.839
but I can't do that.
Can I?

12:19.047 --> 12:19.882
No.

12:20.132 --> 12:22.467
- Has this Raspuli...
- Raisuli.

12:22.885 --> 12:24.136
Raspuli, Raisuli, whatever.

12:24.386 --> 12:25.387
Has he made any terms?

12:25.637 --> 12:26.638
No.

12:27.598 --> 12:29.933
Hmm. Good.
That gives us an excuse.

12:30.142 --> 12:30.934
He will, though.

12:31.143 --> 12:31.977
What makes you so sure?

12:32.185 --> 12:34.229
He kidnapped a
British consul once

12:34.479 --> 12:36.106
but they became friends,
and he sent him back.

12:36.315 --> 12:37.983
- He spat on the blood money.
- Spat on it?

12:38.191 --> 12:39.359
Yes. There's been
others, though

12:39.651 --> 12:41.361
Spanish and French emissaries.

12:41.570 --> 12:43.155
Did he send them
back too?

12:44.156 --> 12:46.533
- Parts of them.
- Parts of them?

12:46.909 --> 12:50.579
Obviously, he has no
respect for human life.

12:53.123 --> 12:55.918
Threatening the lives and
property of American citizens.

12:56.919 --> 13:00.130
It's an insult in the eyes of the
world community, you realize that?

13:00.380 --> 13:04.092
Arabian thief holding me up
like a common desperado.

13:04.343 --> 13:06.094
Theodore, you're
on to something.

13:06.303 --> 13:08.096
I don't quite know what.

13:09.973 --> 13:12.059
What is it that you
want, Theodore?

13:12.267 --> 13:14.603
What do I want?
I want respect, that's what.

13:14.811 --> 13:16.772
Respect for human life
and American property

13:16.980 --> 13:20.692
and I'll send the Atlantic squadron
to Morocco to get respect.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.236
That's illegal.

13:24.196 --> 13:26.323
Now, why spoil the
beauty of a thing

13:26.698 --> 13:27.991
with legality?

13:28.825 --> 13:29.785
Well...

13:30.911 --> 13:32.788
the fleet sails tomorrow.

13:33.205 --> 13:36.249
America wants Pedecaris
alive, or Raisuli dead.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.085
Very good.

13:39.503 --> 13:41.380
Pedecaris alive...

13:43.256 --> 13:44.466
or Raisuli dead.

13:45.550 --> 13:46.802
Bull's-eye.

14:23.630 --> 14:24.881
Ah! Ah!

14:39.312 --> 14:44.151
Horses! Come on now.
We go to the horses, madam.

14:44.359 --> 14:46.194
Don't touch me
with that thing again.

14:46.445 --> 14:49.156
I'm quite capable of
understanding your gibberish.

16:59.870 --> 17:02.455
Jennifer? William? William!?

17:02.664 --> 17:03.623
Your hand, lady.

17:03.874 --> 17:06.917
Oh, get away from me,
for God's sake, you--

17:08.295 --> 17:10.589
Get on those horses,
Jennifer.

17:10.839 --> 17:12.507
Let go of this.

17:22.934 --> 17:25.979
Now, I don't know who you
are or what you want with us

17:26.313 --> 17:28.815
but I will tell you
that I am no coward

17:29.024 --> 17:31.151
and if you or any
of these men

17:31.359 --> 17:33.236
should dare to lay
a hand on me

17:33.445 --> 17:36.573
I will try with all the
strength in me to kill you.

17:36.781 --> 17:40.577
And with my last breath,
I shall curse you to God.

17:42.746 --> 17:44.706
God will listen.

17:45.373 --> 17:47.167
Do you play checkers?

17:47.375 --> 17:49.294
No. I play chess.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.213
Better.

18:23.453 --> 18:24.871
This is the Rif.

18:25.247 --> 18:30.835
I am Mulay Achmed Mohammed
el-Raisuli the Magnificent.

18:31.253 --> 18:33.505
Sherif of the
Riffian Berbers.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.757
I am the true defender
of the faithful

18:36.258 --> 18:38.343
and the blood of the
Prophet runs in me

18:38.551 --> 18:41.137
and I am but a
servant of his will.

18:43.640 --> 18:44.891
You have nothing to say?

18:45.100 --> 18:48.270
It has never been my intention
to encourage braggarts.

18:49.562 --> 18:52.148
Your shell is strong,
like a turtle's

18:52.357 --> 18:53.608
but it is brittle.

18:53.817 --> 18:55.694
Your tongue
is clever and fast.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.571
Be careful you
do not trip over it.

18:59.489 --> 19:02.158
You are a great
deal of trouble.

19:13.295 --> 19:14.587
Now, see here, Abal.

19:14.796 --> 19:18.425
I don't intend to waste any
more time watching you eat.

19:18.717 --> 19:20.885
This is an effrontery.

19:22.178 --> 19:25.432
Have you ever heard of
the "big stick," Bashaw?

19:25.640 --> 19:29.144
Do not threaten me,
Mr. Gummere.

19:30.061 --> 19:32.063
I have been threatened
by the French...

19:32.772 --> 19:34.107
Germans...

19:34.316 --> 19:35.900
and the English.

19:36.860 --> 19:39.362
I've been threatened by experts

19:39.571 --> 19:41.323
Mr. Gummere.

19:43.533 --> 19:47.162
And yet Morocco is still the
only sovereign Muslim throne

19:47.370 --> 19:49.205
west of Constantinople.

19:49.414 --> 19:51.333
Yes, but it is shaky.

19:51.666 --> 19:56.296
Yes, we have French infantry
and German cavalry.

19:56.504 --> 19:58.757
Our currency is Spanish

19:58.965 --> 20:01.384
but my nephew is the
Sultan of Morocco.

20:01.593 --> 20:04.596
And it is as it shall be.

20:08.808 --> 20:13.104
Well, if you wish it
to stay that way

20:13.313 --> 20:14.898
then I implore you

20:15.148 --> 20:20.111
to send your French infantry and
your German cavalry into the Rif

20:20.320 --> 20:22.155
and bring our
people back.

20:22.447 --> 20:26.201
Better to serve the
leopard than the fox.

20:26.409 --> 20:28.078
I am only a servant
of the Sultan

20:28.286 --> 20:29.996
the chosen one, the
defender of the faithful.

20:30.872 --> 20:32.540
I can make no such decision.

20:36.711 --> 20:40.423
Very well then, we shall seek an
audience with the Sultan himself.

20:40.715 --> 20:43.009
He will not see you

20:44.010 --> 20:46.221
unless it pleases him.

20:46.471 --> 20:47.430
Now, listen here

20:47.639 --> 20:49.599
we represent
a modern power.

20:49.808 --> 20:52.310
We're talking about Marines,
battleships, big guns.

20:52.519 --> 20:54.938
- We are not fooling about.
- Richard.

20:55.230 --> 20:57.565
We are not here
to make threats,

20:58.066 --> 21:00.110
merely entreaties.

21:00.985 --> 21:02.946
Now, tell me, Bashaw,

21:03.154 --> 21:06.032
what would please
the Sultan? Gold?

21:10.286 --> 21:12.580
More bicycles?

21:13.123 --> 21:14.332
Another carriage?

21:14.541 --> 21:15.375
Lions.

21:15.583 --> 21:16.626
Lions?

21:16.918 --> 21:19.337
Lions would please the Sultan.

21:20.004 --> 21:21.464
Lions are noble.

21:22.632 --> 21:23.633
Very well.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.928
Mr. Dreighton will leave
this afternoon for Fez

21:27.137 --> 21:28.596
with a pair of lions.

21:30.974 --> 21:31.891
Lions?

22:19.230 --> 22:21.357
We shall drink
from my well.

23:05.944 --> 23:07.111
Thank you, William.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.613
That's rather
refreshing.

23:10.865 --> 23:13.993
Here children, have some of
these. They'll give you strength.

23:14.619 --> 23:17.080
Mama, who do you
think he really is?

23:17.288 --> 23:18.790
Is he a pirate?

23:19.040 --> 23:21.960
He's a brigand and a lout.
Pay him no serious mention.

23:22.210 --> 23:24.587
We shall see the better
side of this, God willing.

23:26.256 --> 23:28.174
He has the way about
him, doesn't he?

23:28.883 --> 23:30.969
He sure has the way.

23:48.486 --> 23:51.948
Woman, I want you
to understand this.

23:52.156 --> 23:55.827
I am not a
barbarous man.

23:56.619 --> 24:00.373
I am a scholar and
a leader to my people.

24:00.582 --> 24:02.542
I am not a
barbarous man.

24:04.752 --> 24:08.006
These four men
have dishonored me.

24:08.506 --> 24:10.758
They have eaten from my trees.

24:10.967 --> 24:13.094
They have drunk water
from my wells.

24:13.845 --> 24:15.888
They have done all of
these things to me

24:16.180 --> 24:20.977
and they have not even evoked my
name to God, in thankfulness.

24:24.105 --> 24:25.690
I am treated this way

24:25.940 --> 24:28.693
because I make war
upon the Europeans.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.116
You see the man
at the well?

24:35.366 --> 24:36.701
How he draws the water?

24:37.243 --> 24:39.871
When one bucket
empties, the other fills.

24:40.330 --> 24:42.123
It is so with the world.

24:42.332 --> 24:45.501
At present, you
are full of power.

24:45.710 --> 24:47.587
But you are spilling
it wastefully

24:47.795 --> 24:50.673
and Islam is lapping
up the drops

24:50.882 --> 24:53.176
as they spill
from your bucket.

25:18.451 --> 25:19.702
Oh!

25:29.629 --> 25:31.297
Did you see that?

26:36.946 --> 26:39.782
And you are not
a barbarous man.

26:40.116 --> 26:41.451
They had broken God's will.

26:41.659 --> 26:43.119
You mean they had
broken your will!

26:43.369 --> 26:45.329
I have no will,
only that of God.

26:45.580 --> 26:48.332
I had to kill the two or I could
not trust the other two.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.209
A barbarous man would
have killed them al--

26:50.418 --> 26:51.294
Of course.

26:51.502 --> 26:53.421
Be not so quick
to judge our ways.

26:53.838 --> 26:56.674
Ignorance is a steep hill with
perilous rocks at the bottom.

26:56.924 --> 26:58.426
Do YOU pray often?

26:59.302 --> 27:01.179
I pray to Mecca
five times a day.

27:01.471 --> 27:03.848
Is that so? I wonder
how you find time.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.892
You're so busy cutting
off men's heads

27:06.100 --> 27:07.477
and kidnapping
women and children.

27:07.685 --> 27:11.230
If I miss the morning prayer,
I pray twice in the afternoon.

27:11.522 --> 27:13.316
Allah is very understanding.

27:36.339 --> 27:39.091
You gonna build that canal
in Panama, Teddy?

27:39.300 --> 27:41.511
I'll dig it with my own
hands if I have to.

27:44.680 --> 27:46.224
Remember the Maine!

27:46.766 --> 27:48.267
I remembered it, did you?

27:49.435 --> 27:53.439
Teddy, you ain't gonna let them
push us around in Morocco?

27:54.148 --> 27:56.776
Madam, I have something
to say about Morocco.

27:57.276 --> 27:58.694
This is a good time
as any to say it.

27:59.737 --> 28:01.364
It is my policy.

28:01.572 --> 28:03.157
It's my policy

28:03.533 --> 28:06.661
to protect American citizens
and American interests

28:06.869 --> 28:08.830
whenever, wherever
they are threatened.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.002
And-- And furthermore.
Furthermore

28:16.879 --> 28:20.883
I am not a man to stand by
and condone barbaric acts

28:21.092 --> 28:24.720
which are perpetrated against
innocent women and children.

28:28.224 --> 28:31.227
We shall mete out
justice that is swift

28:31.435 --> 28:33.563
and retribution
that is final.

28:34.355 --> 28:38.359
America wants Pedecaris
alive or Raisuli dead.

29:09.432 --> 29:10.683
I was good,
wasn't I, John?

29:11.100 --> 29:12.351
It was a marvelous speech.

29:12.685 --> 29:14.395
I'd even vote
for you myself.

29:32.163 --> 29:33.998
Have the train go slowly.

29:34.290 --> 29:35.875
I want to listen
to them a while.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.221
You will be more
pleased here.

31:12.471 --> 31:13.806
Sleep better.

31:14.015 --> 31:15.891
It is the wish
of the Raisuli.

31:16.058 --> 31:18.269
Be sure and thank
him for me.

31:36.495 --> 31:37.747
You will sleep here.

31:39.165 --> 31:41.542
Yes, I was told.

31:42.084 --> 31:43.002
Good.

32:43.020 --> 32:44.814
You do not want to eat?

32:45.272 --> 32:48.067
This is not a good move.
I can take your knight.

32:48.651 --> 32:50.402
- You can?
- Yes.

32:51.362 --> 32:53.948
Well, the loss of my knight
does not mean you will win.

32:54.365 --> 32:56.826
The lion takes long strides

32:57.034 --> 32:58.953
but the path is worn
smooth by pygmy armies.

32:59.912 --> 33:03.290
Yes, and a fool and his
money are soon parted.

33:04.083 --> 33:06.127
I've checked
your queen also.

33:11.882 --> 33:13.801
You are in a
lot of trouble.

33:14.009 --> 33:16.512
You should never have moved
that bishop or kidnapped me.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.681
Both will see you undone.

33:18.889 --> 33:21.892
It is not I who decides
the outcome of these events.

33:22.101 --> 33:23.686
It is the will of Allah.

33:24.061 --> 33:26.188
I am but an instrument
of that will.

33:28.858 --> 33:33.028
It is the wind that passes,
but the sea remains.

33:33.571 --> 33:35.364
A stitch in time saves nine.

33:35.573 --> 33:36.699
Make your move.

33:50.462 --> 33:52.506
What do you intend
to do with us?

33:53.424 --> 33:56.886
It is my intention to embarrass
Mulay Abdul Azziz

33:57.094 --> 33:58.596
the Sultan to Morocco.

33:59.138 --> 34:01.849
The tribesmen will see
that he is the bought dog

34:02.141 --> 34:03.601
of the European armies,

34:03.809 --> 34:06.729
a slave to French
and German masters.

34:07.104 --> 34:09.982
The tribesmen will
join me in a jihad

34:10.232 --> 34:13.235
to abolish this
foreign pestilence.

34:13.444 --> 34:14.695
And this is your way?

34:14.904 --> 34:17.781
Abducting women and children,
killing unarmed servants?

34:17.989 --> 34:20.034
I prefer to fight the
European armies

34:20.409 --> 34:22.077
but they do not fight as men.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.079
They fight as dogs.

34:24.621 --> 34:26.581
Men prefer to
fight with swords

34:26.790 --> 34:28.626
so they can see
each other's eyes.

34:31.295 --> 34:33.214
Sometimes this is not possible.

34:34.172 --> 34:36.382
Then they fight with rifles.

34:37.760 --> 34:40.888
The Europeans have guns that fire
many times, promiscuously

34:41.096 --> 34:42.473
and rend the earth.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.809
There is no honor in this.
Nothing is decided from this.

34:46.643 --> 34:48.020
Therefore,

34:48.728 --> 34:52.315
I shall take women and children
when it pleases me.

34:53.734 --> 34:55.777
What have you demanded
for our return?

34:56.987 --> 34:59.657
Gold, rifles...

35:01.116 --> 35:04.036
the head of the Bashaw
in a basket of melons...

35:05.329 --> 35:07.206
the sovereignty
of my people.

35:07.748 --> 35:10.042
The English have paid
very well in the past.

35:10.417 --> 35:12.795
Well, you'll not have your way
with the Americans.

35:13.003 --> 35:15.256
President Roosevelt will have
your head for this.

35:16.924 --> 35:17.883
Roosevelt.

35:18.509 --> 35:20.386
This President Roosevelt

35:21.470 --> 35:22.846
he would try and
take it himself?

35:23.055 --> 35:24.473
He certainly would.

35:24.723 --> 35:27.017
He is a man of grit
and strong moral fiber.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.603
He does not kidnap
women and children.

35:32.356 --> 35:33.941
What kind of rifle does he use?

35:34.316 --> 35:35.609
A Winchester.

35:36.318 --> 35:37.278
Winchester?

35:39.113 --> 35:40.406
Winchester?

35:44.535 --> 35:45.953
I have no knowledge
of this rifle.

35:46.787 --> 35:47.788
You will.

36:29.246 --> 36:31.623
Sherif of Wazan,
Lord of the desert.

36:32.583 --> 36:33.667
Mrs. Pedecaris.

36:34.001 --> 36:35.169
The pleasure is mine.

36:35.586 --> 36:36.462
Charmed.

36:36.670 --> 36:37.963
The Sherif has honored me

36:38.172 --> 36:40.674
by carrying my entreaties
to the Europeans.

36:44.803 --> 36:46.513
What is that?

36:47.681 --> 36:49.683
That is a tongue.

36:50.893 --> 36:54.271
Well, why would anyone want
to cut out a man's tongue?

36:54.855 --> 36:58.317
Perhaps the previous owner
had nothing pleasant to say.

37:02.154 --> 37:04.490
I believe I'm
about to be sick.

37:05.616 --> 37:06.658
Must be the heat.

37:06.867 --> 37:08.452
- What is it?
- Some kind of tongue.

37:08.660 --> 37:09.453
What kind?

37:09.661 --> 37:11.163
Children, get up from that
tongue. Good God.

37:13.374 --> 37:15.334
The reply from the
American Bashaw.

37:15.542 --> 37:17.378
Himself speaking for the
Lord of the Americans.

37:17.586 --> 37:19.380
- President Roosevelt?
-Mm-hmm.

37:21.965 --> 37:24.885
"Pedecaris alive
or Raisuli dead"?

37:26.553 --> 37:28.013
You are not in a
position to laugh.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.435
Do not laugh
at the Raisuli!

37:44.530 --> 37:45.948
Go to Zinat.

37:46.156 --> 37:47.699
Cut the small finger
from a woman.

37:47.908 --> 37:49.660
Take it to
these Americans.

37:50.035 --> 37:52.913
Tell them it is a finger
of the woman Pedecaris

37:53.455 --> 37:55.666
and that the Raisuli
is a man of patience,

37:55.874 --> 37:57.584
but not unending.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.923
Does this President,
this Roosevelt

38:03.298 --> 38:05.551
does he have no respect
for human life?

38:30.993 --> 38:32.453
Hey, what'd you
bring in, Colonel?

38:33.412 --> 38:36.039
Got some venison and a cougar.

38:36.498 --> 38:38.333
Heard about the
bear, have you?

38:38.584 --> 38:39.668
Big one, I heard.

38:47.676 --> 38:49.011
Coffee, Mr. President?

38:56.518 --> 38:57.686
Is that the bear?

38:58.187 --> 39:00.939
Yes, this is the bear that attacked
the horse camp at dawn.

39:01.899 --> 39:05.068
He knew that men would be
asleep or at their worst, at dawn.

39:06.278 --> 39:08.447
You know, he injured one of
the Indians quite severely.

39:08.655 --> 39:10.449
Killed several of
the horses too.

39:10.782 --> 39:13.702
Did you yourself participate in
stopping the bear, Mr. President?

39:13.911 --> 39:15.662
Yes, I regret to say.

39:16.038 --> 39:18.040
Why do you regret,
Mr. President?

39:18.248 --> 39:19.583
Because he's a fine creature.

39:20.751 --> 39:22.002
This is his valley.

39:22.878 --> 39:25.839
This valley belonged to the bear
and we're the intruders here.

39:27.925 --> 39:29.968
We're accustomed to wild
animals taking flight

39:30.177 --> 39:31.762
at the sight of men with guns.

39:32.262 --> 39:34.181
The American grizzly
fears nothing

39:34.806 --> 39:36.975
not man, not
guns, not death.

39:37.976 --> 39:41.104
Do you intend to have this bear as a
rug in the White House, Mr. President?

39:41.313 --> 39:42.606
Rug? No.

39:42.898 --> 39:45.901
No, I intend to have him stuffed
and placed on exhibit.

39:46.235 --> 39:47.861
The Smithsonian Institute.

39:49.112 --> 39:51.281
The American grizzly bear

39:51.490 --> 39:53.617
is a symbol of the
American character:

39:54.284 --> 39:57.829
Strength, intelligence, ferocity.

39:59.706 --> 40:01.917
A little blind and
reckless at times

40:03.126 --> 40:05.337
but courageous beyond all doubt.

40:05.963 --> 40:08.257
And one other trait that
goes with all previous.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.050
And that, Mr. President?

40:10.259 --> 40:11.468
Loneliness.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.929
A bear lives out his life alone.

40:15.597 --> 40:19.851
Indomitable, unconquered,
but always alone.

40:20.519 --> 40:22.062
He has no real allies,
only enemies

40:22.271 --> 40:23.689
but none of them
are as great as he.

40:24.314 --> 40:26.858
Do you feel this might be
an American trait?

40:27.109 --> 40:28.318
Certainly.

40:28.569 --> 40:30.445
The world will
never love us.

40:31.113 --> 40:32.447
It may respect us

40:32.739 --> 40:35.993
they may even grow to fear us,
but they will never love us

40:36.743 --> 40:39.413
for we have too
much audacity

40:39.871 --> 40:44.084
and we're a bit blind
and reckless at times too.

40:44.418 --> 40:46.545
Are you perhaps referring
to the Panama Canal

40:46.753 --> 40:48.297
and the situation
in Morocco?

40:48.505 --> 40:49.965
If you say so.

40:51.300 --> 40:54.886
The American grizzly
embodies the spirit of America.

40:55.095 --> 40:59.224
He should be our symbol,
not that ridiculous eagle.

40:59.725 --> 41:02.561
He's no more than
a dandified vulture.

41:05.856 --> 41:06.857
Dandified.

41:50.442 --> 41:51.610
Do you speak
English?

41:51.818 --> 41:52.819
Yes, sire.

41:53.028 --> 41:54.404
Tell me,

41:54.613 --> 41:57.240
why doesn't the Sultan
build the road to Fez?

41:57.741 --> 42:00.369
I had to bring these
lions by camel.

42:02.537 --> 42:03.747
Do you know
what that's like?

42:03.955 --> 42:05.082
No, sire.

42:05.290 --> 42:06.917
It wasn't easy.

42:08.794 --> 42:12.422
The ease of others is not
the concern of the Sultan.

42:13.548 --> 42:15.342
We'll build a road
some day.

42:15.550 --> 42:17.344
A road? Here?

42:17.969 --> 42:19.179
Foolish.

42:19.554 --> 42:21.348
The desert
is like the sea.

42:21.932 --> 42:24.059
You cannot build
a road in the sea.

42:26.937 --> 42:27.979
We will.

42:28.605 --> 42:30.399
We have men that
can do anything.

42:32.651 --> 42:34.236
Absolutely anything.

42:35.112 --> 42:36.780
We have men
that can fly.

42:37.322 --> 42:38.281
Fly?

42:39.658 --> 42:40.867
Fly.

43:03.348 --> 43:04.307
Watch the goal.

43:04.516 --> 43:06.351
Watch the goal.
Watch the goal.

43:13.442 --> 43:16.027
Say, haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

43:17.487 --> 43:18.780
<i>Nein.</i>

43:47.309 --> 43:50.187
Perhaps Your
Highness Abdul

43:50.395 --> 43:52.647
would care to fire
the Maxim gun?

44:11.917 --> 44:14.211
Herr Sultan
is displeased?

44:14.878 --> 44:16.087
This is broken.

44:16.296 --> 44:17.088
Mend it.

44:17.881 --> 44:20.467
The ambassador of the
Americans, Your Exultancy.

44:21.343 --> 44:25.347
I am Mulay Abdul Azziz,
Sultan to Morocco.

44:26.723 --> 44:29.434
It has been said that you
have brought me lions.

44:29.851 --> 44:31.603
Yes, sir, two of them.

44:34.064 --> 44:35.357
It's out of bounds.

44:37.776 --> 44:40.487
It would please me to take the
pleasure of this meeting

44:40.695 --> 44:42.197
in my carriage of state.

44:43.031 --> 44:44.032
You will come.

44:54.876 --> 44:55.919
Beautiful.

44:56.628 --> 44:59.089
It is quite extraordinary.

45:06.429 --> 45:07.806
You may sit.

45:14.479 --> 45:16.064
You wish to discuss the Raisuli?

45:16.314 --> 45:17.107
Yes.

45:17.357 --> 45:19.317
Have you made any
contact with his people?

45:19.609 --> 45:22.195
He wishes for the return
of the woman Pedecaris

45:22.445 --> 45:25.907
that he be granted the lands
of the Rif by formal decree,

45:26.116 --> 45:27.909
and that the Bashaw
of Tangier's head

45:28.118 --> 45:29.744
be presented in a golden jar.

45:31.913 --> 45:33.248
He didn't ask for money?

45:33.456 --> 45:35.083
Yes, but that
is honorable.

45:35.292 --> 45:37.043
You have offered
to pay it, I presume.

45:37.252 --> 45:38.920
Do not distress me
by such a question.

45:39.129 --> 45:41.882
Now, see here, we will have
our people back and right quick

45:42.090 --> 45:43.842
or we are prepared
to do something about it.

45:44.050 --> 45:45.927
I will not endure
this treatment.

45:46.177 --> 45:48.430
Have you ever heard
of the "big stick," Sultan?

45:48.638 --> 45:50.515
Right now, there are
squadrons of warships

45:50.724 --> 45:51.892
in your coastal waters.

45:52.100 --> 45:54.561
In days, there will be
Marines, cavalry

45:54.769 --> 45:56.813
and artillery to enforce
my demands.

45:57.022 --> 45:59.608
Now, my country wants
the woman Pedecaris alive

45:59.816 --> 46:01.026
or Raisuli dead.

46:01.234 --> 46:03.403
You cannot talk to the
defender of the faithful

46:03.612 --> 46:05.322
in this manner!

46:06.072 --> 46:08.783
You do not understand it!

46:12.579 --> 46:14.831
It is so difficult
to be Sultan.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.249
You do not understand.

46:18.126 --> 46:20.754
What do you know
of this Raisuli?

46:22.797 --> 46:26.301
He is a wonderful man,
a servant of God

46:26.801 --> 46:29.638
but he is a brigand
and a criminal as well.

46:30.013 --> 46:32.641
He taught me to shoot a rifle
when I was five years old.

46:32.933 --> 46:33.892
You know him?

46:34.309 --> 46:35.769
He is my uncle.

46:36.269 --> 46:38.396
But the Bashaw in
Tangier is your uncle.

46:38.605 --> 46:40.941
They are both my uncles.
They are brothers.

46:42.817 --> 46:45.070
It is so difficult
to be Sultan.

46:45.862 --> 46:48.531
You foreigners
do not understand.

47:43.211 --> 47:44.546
These are
my true riches.

47:44.921 --> 47:47.590
A man's worth is counted
in the number of his rifles.

47:47.799 --> 47:51.261
Does this Roosevelt,
does he have such men?

47:51.720 --> 47:52.846
Probably not.

47:53.054 --> 47:53.888
Well, with such men

47:54.097 --> 47:56.558
who needs guns that fire
many times promiscuously?

47:56.975 --> 47:58.018
Machine guns?

47:58.226 --> 48:00.603
Yes. Who needs
such guns?

48:06.526 --> 48:08.528
Well, maybe I don't
believe it, either.

48:23.209 --> 48:24.794
Look at this.

48:25.253 --> 48:26.838
Where'd you
get it, William?

48:27.047 --> 48:28.590
Did you steal it?

48:28.798 --> 48:31.217
No. He gave it to me.

48:31.509 --> 48:33.136
Gayaan the Terrible.

48:33.970 --> 48:36.389
He's a brigand who's
killed over 30 men.

48:36.931 --> 48:38.433
Did he kill any with that?

48:40.310 --> 48:41.478
Certainly.

48:43.980 --> 48:45.648
What will they do with us,
William?

48:46.066 --> 48:47.442
Keep us.

48:47.776 --> 48:52.614
Teach us to ride, shoot,
cut men's throats

48:52.822 --> 48:54.532
and be brigands.

48:55.575 --> 48:56.785
Even girls?

48:56.993 --> 48:59.579
Yes, but you'll have
to wear a veil.

49:34.114 --> 49:35.782
Happy birthday!

49:36.116 --> 49:38.034
Happy birthday, Father.

49:38.243 --> 49:39.494
Happy birthday.

49:39.702 --> 49:41.287
Blow out the candles, Father.

49:41.788 --> 49:43.832
Takes a big wind,
lots of hot air.

49:44.290 --> 49:46.334
Then I'll need some help
from you, Mr. Hay.

49:47.001 --> 49:48.336
I propose a toast.

49:49.170 --> 49:50.505
To the Panama Canal.

49:53.341 --> 49:56.010
Yes, and Jupiter
Pierpont Morgan.

49:58.096 --> 50:01.432
Likie knifie?
You likie forkie?

50:02.058 --> 50:03.059
Splendid.

50:03.643 --> 50:06.020
And now, Mr. President, blow.

50:22.996 --> 50:24.539
May the breath
of Theodore Roosevelt

50:24.747 --> 50:27.750
be like the wind that he has
sent across the Pacific.

50:28.209 --> 50:31.254
Wind that bends the trees
of aggression and injustice

50:31.462 --> 50:33.840
but a true wind marked
also for its warmth.

50:34.257 --> 50:35.717
An American wind.

50:44.517 --> 50:46.644
You likie speechie?

50:47.437 --> 50:50.648
Well, I suppose I should
make the first cut here.

50:56.154 --> 50:57.780
See? Nothing to it.

50:58.156 --> 50:59.532
There you are.

50:59.949 --> 51:01.409
See how easy that was?

51:01.618 --> 51:03.411
Now, you all go on
and finish it.

51:04.120 --> 51:05.663
Not having any,
Mr. President?

51:05.872 --> 51:07.957
Oh, no. No cake
for me, John

51:08.166 --> 51:09.334
birthday or no.

51:09.918 --> 51:11.169
I have to remain
fit and trim

51:11.377 --> 51:12.587
vigorous and active.

51:12.795 --> 51:15.840
After all, this Raisuli fellow
is reputed to be over 50

51:16.049 --> 51:18.384
and still a very
formidable brigand.

51:18.593 --> 51:21.804
You may well make a
formidable brigand yourself.

51:22.847 --> 51:25.141
You've made
a good start in life

51:25.350 --> 51:27.435
and we all have
high hopes for you

51:27.685 --> 51:29.771
when you grow up.

51:31.189 --> 51:33.191
Now I shall have
some of your cake.

51:33.733 --> 51:35.401
Let them eat cake,
huh, kid?

51:35.610 --> 51:36.819
Not good for you, John.

51:37.028 --> 51:38.363
Neither are those cigars.

51:38.571 --> 51:40.949
At my age, I can afford it.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.284
Let me see that.

51:57.006 --> 51:59.425
Take a note to the Winchester
Repeating Arms Company

51:59.634 --> 52:01.010
New Haven, Connecticut.

52:02.428 --> 52:03.388
Dear Sirs,

52:03.763 --> 52:05.515
I have received my
improved model

52:05.723 --> 52:08.559
1895 Winchester
in .405 caliber.

52:09.352 --> 52:12.063
As you and I both know,
this is a very fine rifle.

52:12.397 --> 52:15.858
However, once again
you have blundered

52:16.067 --> 52:18.278
both in regard to
the stock dimensions

52:18.486 --> 52:19.612
and the recoil pad.

52:20.488 --> 52:22.699
How long will these
mistakes be repeated?

52:23.616 --> 52:25.785
After all, I am the President
of the United States.

52:25.994 --> 52:28.079
I see no reason why
an American President

52:28.288 --> 52:30.498
can't get satisfaction from
an American gun maker.

52:30.707 --> 52:33.001
Huh? What must I do
for a proper fitting?

52:33.209 --> 52:34.085
Go to England?

52:34.294 --> 52:35.878
- I should hope not.
- No, sir.

52:37.088 --> 52:39.007
Why are you standing there
like that, young man?

52:39.215 --> 52:40.675
- In regard to your--
-Well, speak up. Speak up.

52:40.883 --> 52:42.927
This is a government,
not a rest home. What is it?

52:43.136 --> 52:44.679
- Your bear, sir.
- My bear? What bear?

52:44.887 --> 52:46.222
- Your grizzly bear, sir.
- He's from the Smithsonian.

52:46.431 --> 52:48.141
Oh, the Smithsonian.
Yes, you have the sketches.

52:48.349 --> 52:49.267
Thank you.

52:49.475 --> 52:52.729
Now, let's see.
Let me see these.

52:53.354 --> 52:55.523
Oh, I'm sorry.
That won't do.

52:55.857 --> 52:57.358
No, that's--
No, that's all wrong.

52:57.567 --> 52:58.943
That's terrible.

52:59.152 --> 53:00.153
And that one.

53:00.820 --> 53:02.447
You see, what's wrong
here, young man

53:02.655 --> 53:04.198
is the position.

53:04.449 --> 53:06.117
You've made this fine
specimen of a grizzly

53:06.326 --> 53:08.077
look like a hairy cow.

53:08.703 --> 53:12.582
Now, would you like to be portrayed as
a hairy cow if you were a grizzly bear?

53:12.832 --> 53:15.209
Perhaps the President
had a position in mind.

53:15.418 --> 53:17.295
Certainly. There you are.

53:17.503 --> 53:18.546
Now, watch.

53:18.755 --> 53:20.340
The American grizzly

53:20.631 --> 53:22.800
must always be portrayed
in a fighting stance.

53:23.009 --> 53:24.177
That's the sort of animal he is.

53:24.385 --> 53:26.763
You see, upright, rampant,
on his two hind feet.

53:26.971 --> 53:28.556
His great forepaws
extended like that.

53:28.765 --> 53:31.059
Teeth bared, clawing, growling.

53:33.436 --> 53:34.187
Understand?

53:34.395 --> 53:35.438
- Would you like to sketch that?
-Yes sir.

53:35.646 --> 53:36.356
Take a photograph.

53:36.564 --> 53:37.774
Good. Ready?

53:37.982 --> 53:39.108
Growl again, Father.

53:39.317 --> 53:40.151
You like that?

53:43.071 --> 53:44.489
See that he gets a copy.

53:44.822 --> 53:46.824
Now, where was I
with Winchester?

53:47.784 --> 53:50.244
Um. "What must I do
for a proper fitting?

53:50.453 --> 53:51.454
Need I go to England?"

53:51.662 --> 53:52.914
Yes, uh.

53:53.122 --> 53:55.249
Oh, that's all right the
way it is. Send it out.

53:56.376 --> 53:59.128
What must a man do, anyway,
to get a proper-fitting rifle?

54:00.171 --> 54:03.216
You can bet that Raisuli fellow's
got a rifle that fits him.

54:03.424 --> 54:06.135
Those people know the
value of a good weapon.

54:06.969 --> 54:09.764
The rifle is the very
soul of the Arab.

54:10.139 --> 54:11.849
Raisuli's a Berber,
Mr. President.

54:12.058 --> 54:13.893
Well, it goes double
for Berbers.

54:14.102 --> 54:15.686
What sort of rifle does
he use, do you suppose?

54:15.895 --> 54:17.980
- I don't know, sir.
-Well, send him a cablegram.

54:18.189 --> 54:20.233
Find out what kind of weapon
the old bastard uses.

54:21.526 --> 54:22.652
I think you're the best shot

54:22.860 --> 54:24.487
that's ever occupied
the office, sir.

54:24.695 --> 54:26.030
Oh, I don't know.

54:26.239 --> 54:28.699
Andrew Jackson back
there was quite a shot.

54:28.908 --> 54:30.993
Carried a brace of pistols
all the time, you know.

54:31.202 --> 54:34.038
Shot a fellow right off
the porch right out there.

54:34.247 --> 54:35.540
Caned another one to death.

55:08.156 --> 55:09.866
Admiral Chadwick,
I presume.

55:10.324 --> 55:11.868
I'm Vice Consul
Richard Dreighton.

55:12.076 --> 55:13.619
- Ray.
-Admiral.

55:13.828 --> 55:15.204
It's certainly good
to see you.

55:15.413 --> 55:16.581
Captain.

55:16.789 --> 55:18.583
I must say we've been
awaiting your arrival

55:18.791 --> 55:20.626
with a great deal
of anticipation

55:20.835 --> 55:22.879
and I must say,
not a little nervousness.

55:23.379 --> 55:24.964
You see, gentlemen

55:25.339 --> 55:27.467
what we have here
is a problem

55:27.675 --> 55:31.095
of enormous
diplomatic complexity.

55:31.929 --> 55:33.931
Now, the Sultan
of Morocco--

55:34.765 --> 55:36.809
Make yourselves
comfortable, gentlemen.

55:37.351 --> 55:41.397
The Sultan of Morocco
favors the German Kaiser

55:41.606 --> 55:45.026
while the Bashaw,
who is the real power here

55:45.234 --> 55:47.570
is leaning toward
the Czar of Russia.

55:48.446 --> 55:49.947
Now, in the middle
of all this

55:51.282 --> 55:54.827
an American woman is kidnapped
by some desert pirate

55:55.036 --> 55:58.706
and our President, of course,
gentlemen, only wants to know

55:58.956 --> 56:02.335
what kind of a rifle
this brigand carries.

56:04.045 --> 56:08.591
And he probably wants
to build a canal too

56:08.799 --> 56:09.634
for all I know.

56:09.842 --> 56:11.052
It's been done
before, you know.

56:11.260 --> 56:12.595
Now, now, Admiral.

56:12.845 --> 56:17.016
Mr. Dreighton, see if the gentlemen
care for a cigar, would you, please?

56:18.267 --> 56:19.852
You and I are both old men

56:20.061 --> 56:22.146
and we've seen these
disasters come and go.

56:22.939 --> 56:25.191
Now, our problem is
to make this one go

56:26.692 --> 56:28.069
and make it look good.

56:29.153 --> 56:30.571
I must remind you, sir

56:30.780 --> 56:33.407
that I was at Santiago Bay
when this President

56:33.616 --> 56:35.284
was running up
San Juan Hill.

56:35.952 --> 56:39.121
I'm afraid that we'll have to do
more than just look good this time.

56:39.622 --> 56:42.208
Well, what did you
have in mind, exactly?

56:44.085 --> 56:45.586
Military intervention.

56:47.046 --> 56:48.756
Yes. We are,
at this moment

56:48.965 --> 56:51.968
the most powerful naval
force in Tangier Harbor.

56:53.427 --> 56:56.347
Well, I-- I don't see what
that has to do with anything.

56:56.806 --> 56:58.558
We are a major power
at this moment.

56:58.849 --> 57:00.309
We carry the
biggest stick.

57:00.726 --> 57:04.897
Now, just how many men
do you have, captain?

57:05.231 --> 57:06.857
Two reinforced
rifle companies, sir.

57:07.316 --> 57:09.819
Well, you see, the
Sultan of Morocco

57:10.027 --> 57:13.406
has three foreign
regiments in Fez.

57:13.614 --> 57:14.865
That's right, sir.
They're at Fez.

57:15.616 --> 57:19.745
The Bashaw has only his household
cavalry and guard here.

57:20.580 --> 57:22.748
The power lies
with the Bashaw.

57:27.253 --> 57:28.796
Who is this boy?

57:29.338 --> 57:30.715
Let him go on.

57:33.759 --> 57:35.970
It would be as useless
chasing Raisuli

57:36.262 --> 57:38.889
as the redcoats on Bunker Hill.

57:39.432 --> 57:43.144
And the Sultan, if I'm
correct in my assumption

57:43.352 --> 57:44.478
will not meet his demands.

57:44.687 --> 57:46.272
Yes, go on.

57:46.480 --> 57:49.734
The Sultan is not the power.
The real government is here.

57:50.276 --> 57:51.277
That's right.

57:51.819 --> 57:53.946
Well, it'd seem quite obvious,
I would think, sir.

57:54.155 --> 57:56.699
We must seize the government
and make our own negotiations.

57:56.991 --> 57:58.409
Seize the government?

57:58.618 --> 58:00.036
At bayonet point.

58:09.420 --> 58:10.755
I certainly would like to see

58:10.963 --> 58:13.591
that old son of a bitch
at bayonet point, huh?

58:14.592 --> 58:17.970
But it's ridiculous.
It's outrageous. It's lunatic.

58:18.179 --> 58:19.889
Yes, isn't it, though?

58:20.097 --> 58:22.058
I should think
Teddy would love it.

58:22.266 --> 58:26.896
What about the French,
the Germans, the British?

58:27.104 --> 58:29.482
Why, we're in the
Shadow of Gibraltar.

58:29.899 --> 58:31.776
Damn the legations.

58:37.698 --> 58:39.116
You realize, of course

58:39.325 --> 58:42.453
that if we fail in this,
in even the slightest way

58:43.996 --> 58:45.623
we'll all be killed.

58:45.831 --> 58:46.832
Yes

58:47.458 --> 58:50.544
and the whole world
will probably go to war.

58:51.087 --> 58:54.173
Gentlemen, if we fail
and are killed

58:54.382 --> 58:57.343
I certainly hope that the
world does go to war.

59:00.012 --> 59:01.639
World at war.

59:03.724 --> 59:05.393
A world war.

59:07.353 --> 59:10.272
Now that would be
something to go out on.

59:12.400 --> 59:14.777
William. Jennifer.
Jennifer!

59:15.236 --> 59:17.738
What is it, Mama?
I was sleeping.

59:17.947 --> 59:19.657
Dress quickly in the
robes they gave you.

59:19.907 --> 59:21.742
Why are you
dressed like that?

59:21.951 --> 59:22.868
Where are we going?

59:23.077 --> 59:25.037
We're going to make
good an escape.

59:25.454 --> 59:26.706
An escape?

59:26.914 --> 59:28.958
Right now?
I was asleep.

59:29.166 --> 59:32.378
You cannot wait for these things to
occur at your convenience, Jennifer.

59:32.586 --> 59:34.004
Now, I've bribed
a man with jewels.

59:34.213 --> 59:36.006
Now, come on.
Get dressed and hurry up.

59:45.224 --> 59:46.434
William!

01:00:12.543 --> 01:00:14.837
Come along.
Be quick about it.

01:01:15.981 --> 01:01:18.108
The rifle, boy.
Rifle.

01:01:18.317 --> 01:01:19.652
Yes, it is mine.

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.987
Give me your rifle.
Give it to me, yeah?

01:01:22.196 --> 01:01:24.698
You'll get the rifle when we
reach safety and not before.

01:01:24.949 --> 01:01:26.450
Now move ahead.

01:04:40.894 --> 01:04:42.563
I'll take the rifle,
I want it.

01:04:44.148 --> 01:04:45.107
Be careful.

01:04:45.524 --> 01:04:45.899
Help!

01:04:46.108 --> 01:04:46.817
William!

01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:52.823
William. William.

01:05:22.019 --> 01:05:23.312
Mama.

01:05:29.902 --> 01:05:31.278
William.

01:06:50.774 --> 01:06:52.025
Get back.

01:08:03.931 --> 01:08:06.850
William, get those loose
horses there. Quick.

01:08:07.059 --> 01:08:08.435
Jennifer, go with William.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.250
Mrs. Pedecaris

01:09:13.792 --> 01:09:15.419
you're a great deal
of trouble.

01:09:33.478 --> 01:09:35.397
There is all that
you need here.

01:09:35.647 --> 01:09:37.107
Clothes of the
finest silks

01:09:37.316 --> 01:09:39.609
spiced meats, figs for you
when you wish to eat.

01:09:39.859 --> 01:09:41.319
Scented water
to bathe in.

01:09:41.694 --> 01:09:43.363
But where are
your guards?

01:09:43.572 --> 01:09:46.867
Is it your intention to
let us roam about freely?

01:09:52.413 --> 01:09:54.833
You're the guests
of the Raisuli.

01:09:56.626 --> 01:09:58.462
In the Raisuli's house,

01:09:59.838 --> 01:10:01.173
I don't need guards.

01:10:03.675 --> 01:10:05.969
My eyes are with you
wherever you go.

01:10:06.178 --> 01:10:07.637
Allah is with me

01:10:07.888 --> 01:10:09.931
and no one can
escape from God.

01:10:11.224 --> 01:10:14.102
What will you do if they
do not accept your terms?

01:10:15.937 --> 01:10:16.938
What do you mean?

01:10:18.899 --> 01:10:22.611
What will become of us,
my children and myself?

01:10:28.325 --> 01:10:29.993
I will play chess with
you one more time

01:10:30.202 --> 01:10:32.245
and then return you
to your house.

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:34.664
Alive?

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:37.626
Yes, of course.

01:10:46.593 --> 01:10:48.845
Then you're just
bluffing them.

01:10:50.138 --> 01:10:53.475
You've never had the
intention of killing us.

01:10:54.226 --> 01:10:56.853
Raisuli does not kill
women and children.

01:10:57.229 --> 01:10:58.688
That's a silly question.

01:11:11.326 --> 01:11:12.744
Why do you do this?

01:11:18.959 --> 01:11:21.253
Because I am bluffing too.

01:11:30.345 --> 01:11:34.808
Mrs. Pedecaris,
you trouble me.

01:11:55.162 --> 01:11:57.497
Ship, oars!

01:12:23.607 --> 01:12:25.734
Present arms!

01:12:29.321 --> 01:12:31.948
Good morning, sir.
The company is formed.

01:12:32.157 --> 01:12:34.993
Sergeants, take your post.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.258
company

01:12:51.176 --> 01:12:52.302
fix

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:55.138
bayonets.

01:12:57.349 --> 01:12:58.433
Move!

01:13:00.977 --> 01:13:02.395
Right

01:13:03.396 --> 01:13:04.189
face.

01:13:05.941 --> 01:13:07.150
Port

01:13:08.276 --> 01:13:09.152
arms.

01:13:10.946 --> 01:13:11.947
Column left,

01:13:12.572 --> 01:13:13.365
march!

01:13:48.692 --> 01:13:50.277
Column right,

01:13:50.902 --> 01:13:51.903
march!

01:14:11.339 --> 01:14:13.216
Eyes

01:14:14.175 --> 01:14:15.218
Tight!

01:14:27.230 --> 01:14:29.899
I don't think the French and
Germans are gonna like this.

01:14:30.191 --> 01:14:33.403
Too early in the morning
for rattling sabers.

01:14:38.199 --> 01:14:40.076
Double-time

01:14:41.369 --> 01:14:42.746
march.

01:14:48.001 --> 01:14:49.544
Right on me.

01:15:24.037 --> 01:15:26.373
Column left, now!

01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:48.121
Column left,

01:16:48.329 --> 01:16:49.330
march!

01:16:55.879 --> 01:16:57.297
Column left!

01:17:03.094 --> 01:17:03.762
Quick-time.

01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:04.846
Quick-time.

01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:06.055
March!

01:17:11.978 --> 01:17:14.439
Third and fourth squads,
column right, march.

01:17:14.647 --> 01:17:15.732
First and second squads

01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:17.233
column right, march.

01:17:23.698 --> 01:17:25.116
Mark time

01:17:27.368 --> 01:17:28.369
march.

01:17:34.334 --> 01:17:36.211
company

01:17:37.045 --> 01:17:38.254
halt!

01:17:39.047 --> 01:17:40.715
Hostiles to the left.

01:17:41.216 --> 01:17:42.967
Left face!

01:17:45.053 --> 01:17:47.889
Firing positions, move!

01:17:49.182 --> 01:17:50.016
Aim!

01:17:52.685 --> 01:17:54.479
Fire!

01:17:58.733 --> 01:18:00.568
Prepare to charge
the palace!

01:18:02.445 --> 01:18:03.488
Charge!

01:19:22.692 --> 01:19:25.111
Capt. Jerome,
United States Marine Corps

01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:27.697
and you are
my prisoner, sir.

01:19:28.656 --> 01:19:31.284
You are a very
dangerous man, captain

01:19:31.492 --> 01:19:35.079
and your President
Roosevelt is mad.

01:19:38.041 --> 01:19:39.542
Yes, sir.

01:20:48.403 --> 01:20:49.904
He's gone cowboy again.

01:20:50.363 --> 01:20:53.241
Stand back. Let me
deal with him, or try.

01:20:57.203 --> 01:20:59.956
Theodore, what are you doing?

01:21:06.421 --> 01:21:07.922
Isn't that the Czar?

01:21:08.506 --> 01:21:10.133
A facsimile.

01:21:12.802 --> 01:21:14.721
But that's like shooting
at your own brother.

01:21:15.054 --> 01:21:15.888
Oh, Kermit's in the pits.

01:21:16.097 --> 01:21:17.682
That's his idea
of a little joke.

01:21:18.933 --> 01:21:24.063
Obviously, you relish jokes in view of
your approval of the Gummere report.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.898
I try to go along
with them, John.

01:21:27.817 --> 01:21:31.779
I suppose a declaration of
war would be a joke too?

01:21:32.864 --> 01:21:34.991
Well, you have to admit
it would be entertaining.

01:21:35.199 --> 01:21:36.784
A barrel of laughs.

01:21:36.993 --> 01:21:40.246
Have you any idea of the
risk you're running?

01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:45.126
Have you any idea of the
territory I'd be gaining?

01:21:45.334 --> 01:21:46.210
Theodore.

01:21:51.299 --> 01:21:52.759
You're dangerous.

01:21:53.718 --> 01:21:55.636
You might even
shoot somebody.

01:21:56.012 --> 01:21:57.805
Accidentally, I mean.

01:21:58.264 --> 01:22:00.058
John, I'd never shoot
anyone accidentally.

01:22:00.433 --> 01:22:01.726
I need their votes.

01:22:02.185 --> 01:22:03.394
Madness.

01:22:12.153 --> 01:22:14.030
- Madness.
-Sir?

01:22:14.238 --> 01:22:15.865
Utter madness.

01:22:27.293 --> 01:22:29.003
Why are you closing
your left eye, Father?

01:22:29.212 --> 01:22:31.172
You've always told us to shoot
with both eyes open.

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:34.342
Well, the light bothers me. I can't
see out of that eye anymore.

01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:35.301
What do you mean?

01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:36.844
I'm blind in
my left eye.

01:22:37.053 --> 01:22:39.806
- Since when?
-Since Saturday. Boxing.

01:22:43.059 --> 01:22:45.311
Now, don't say anything
to Edith about it, do you hear?

01:22:45.686 --> 01:22:47.105
Maybe it'll go away.

01:22:48.648 --> 01:22:51.776
And don't let anyone come up
on my left side either.

01:22:53.653 --> 01:22:55.613
Father, is Raisuli
a real pirate?

01:22:55.822 --> 01:22:58.783
Yes, indeed, Quentin. He's the
last of the Barbary pirates.

01:22:58.991 --> 01:23:00.243
Why do you
Say that?

01:23:00.576 --> 01:23:04.288
Well, the world is fast outgrowing
pirates of that sort, anyway.

01:23:04.497 --> 01:23:05.748
Do you know
any others?

01:23:05.957 --> 01:23:07.500
Yes, J.P. Morgan.

01:23:07.708 --> 01:23:09.377
He's the only other
real pirate I know.

01:23:09.585 --> 01:23:11.796
I hope you have him brought
before you in chains.

01:23:12.004 --> 01:23:13.089
J.P. Morgan?
I should hardly--

01:23:13.297 --> 01:23:16.050
No, no, no. Raisuli. Have
Raisuli brought before you.

01:23:16.259 --> 01:23:17.593
I should like
to see that.

01:23:17.802 --> 01:23:20.680
Oh, I should like to see
him too but not in chains.

01:23:21.931 --> 01:23:23.724
Let's have the Winchester, Alice.

01:23:26.853 --> 01:23:28.312
You like him,
don't you, Father?

01:23:28.855 --> 01:23:31.524
You like J.P. Morgan
too, don't you?

01:23:31.732 --> 01:23:33.067
Of course I do, Alice.

01:23:33.401 --> 01:23:34.986
But they're
your enemies.

01:23:35.194 --> 01:23:38.364
Well, sometimes

01:23:39.365 --> 01:23:44.745
one finds that your enemies are a lot
more admirable than your friends.

01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:47.665
You pick the road
to greatness

01:23:48.082 --> 01:23:50.209
and you'll have
that choice some day.

01:23:51.252 --> 01:23:55.006
You come to realize that the
road traveled by great men

01:23:55.298 --> 01:23:56.966
is dark and lonely

01:23:57.508 --> 01:24:00.428
and lit only at intervals
by other great men

01:24:00.636 --> 01:24:02.597
and sometimes they're
your enemies.

01:24:03.139 --> 01:24:05.391
But they're the only
true luxury you have.

01:24:07.476 --> 01:24:11.439
Yes, it's a dark and difficult road and
I do not look down upon anyone

01:24:11.647 --> 01:24:13.232
who has the good sense
not to take it.

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:27.330
I was young

01:24:27.538 --> 01:24:29.832
and full of the sayings
of young men.

01:24:30.041 --> 01:24:32.752
I did not yet understand
the ways of the Prophet

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:34.253
the will of God.

01:24:34.462 --> 01:24:36.964
I thought that men
could oppose such will.

01:24:37.173 --> 01:24:38.591
I was very foolish.

01:24:39.926 --> 01:24:43.679
A man can trust no one,
yet often trusts women.

01:24:45.014 --> 01:24:46.307
I trusted my brother

01:24:46.515 --> 01:24:49.310
and openly opposed
the old Sultan at Fez.

01:24:49.727 --> 01:24:51.687
He was letting the Europeans
give him money

01:24:51.896 --> 01:24:54.732
and money is always
followed by more Europeans.

01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:00.655
My brother betrayed me,
and I was sent to Mogador.

01:25:00.863 --> 01:25:01.948
Mogador?

01:25:02.949 --> 01:25:05.243
It is a dungeon on
the edge of the sea.

01:25:05.618 --> 01:25:07.328
I was sent there to die

01:25:07.536 --> 01:25:09.288
but I was young
and strong.

01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:13.292
My brain was as agile
as my fingers.

01:25:14.293 --> 01:25:17.046
The confinement.
Speak of the confinement.

01:25:17.255 --> 01:25:19.382
It was the intention
of my brother

01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:22.051
to permit the flies and the
ants to consume me

01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:23.636
but as the years passed

01:25:24.095 --> 01:25:26.681
and the chains were
replaced many times

01:25:27.056 --> 01:25:29.308
it was always
I who remained.

01:25:31.394 --> 01:25:34.939
It was then that the guards saw
that the Baraka was with me.

01:25:35.773 --> 01:25:37.149
They arranged my escape.

01:25:38.192 --> 01:25:41.612
I thanked them for the years
of wisdom they had given me

01:25:42.113 --> 01:25:44.198
and I wandered
into the mountains.

01:25:45.449 --> 01:25:47.785
- Are you asleep?
-No. Did I look like it?

01:25:47.994 --> 01:25:49.412
No, but you
made no noise

01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:51.622
and well, others have
fallen asleep while I speak.

01:25:51.831 --> 01:25:54.292
The wandering, Raisuli.

01:25:54.959 --> 01:25:56.460
Uh, yeah.

01:25:57.003 --> 01:25:58.879
I wandered into
the mountains.

01:25:59.422 --> 01:26:02.425
I wished only to hear
the voices of women

01:26:02.633 --> 01:26:06.095
babbling about common things.
You permit me to say

01:26:06.304 --> 01:26:09.140
the conversation of women
does not interest me very much.

01:26:10.474 --> 01:26:14.270
But when one is in prison
one is inclined to have

01:26:14.478 --> 01:26:16.480
a different sense
of disposition.

01:26:19.483 --> 01:26:21.068
The Riffians found me.

01:26:21.652 --> 01:26:25.197
I learned to read
and to speak again.

01:26:25.948 --> 01:26:28.617
The women aided me in this
because of my lineage

01:26:28.826 --> 01:26:29.910
but the men

01:26:31.579 --> 01:26:35.041
they wanted to sell my head to the old
Sultan at Fez for rifles and gold.

01:26:35.541 --> 01:26:37.168
There was but
one thing to do:

01:26:37.501 --> 01:26:39.670
Challenge Abdel
Malak the Cruel.

01:26:39.879 --> 01:26:42.256
We fought with swords
on horseback

01:26:42.798 --> 01:26:44.550
and the Baraka
was with me.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.635
I cut off his arm

01:26:47.428 --> 01:26:49.180
and he wounded me

01:26:50.848 --> 01:26:52.558
many times.

01:26:55.519 --> 01:26:57.063
The tribesmen
judged him

01:26:57.271 --> 01:26:59.607
and every voice
was against him.

01:27:00.399 --> 01:27:01.734
And his eyes

01:27:02.568 --> 01:27:04.779
which had witnessed
much injustice

01:27:04.987 --> 01:27:07.531
were burned out with
heated copper coins.

01:27:09.617 --> 01:27:11.702
And today, he
wanders the land

01:27:12.036 --> 01:27:13.746
a blind beggar.

01:27:15.998 --> 01:27:19.752
Thus, I became the true
defender of the faithful

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:21.629
for the blood of the
Prophet runs in me

01:27:21.837 --> 01:27:24.340
and I am but an
instrument of his will.

01:27:56.789 --> 01:27:57.790
Salaam.

01:27:57.998 --> 01:28:01.001
Raisuli, Lord of the Rif. Salaam.

01:28:01.210 --> 01:28:02.086
Salaam.

01:28:05.506 --> 01:28:07.800
I have never seen
such fierce retainers.

01:28:08.008 --> 01:28:09.552
Well, these are my immortals.

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:10.594
They have such--

01:28:10.803 --> 01:28:13.764
- Jennifer, put that thing down.
-Let it be.

01:28:14.515 --> 01:28:16.225
They are feared in
the streets of hell

01:28:16.434 --> 01:28:19.228
and their courage is such that golden
thrones await them in paradise.

01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:23.524
You are pleased, Sherif?

01:28:23.732 --> 01:28:24.733
I am pleased

01:28:24.942 --> 01:28:26.527
the Raisuli
will be pleased.

01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:30.030
The Bashaw offers this:

01:28:30.239 --> 01:28:33.033
70,000 pieces
of Spanish gold

01:28:33.742 --> 01:28:36.662
all foreign soldiers to be
removed from the Rif

01:28:36.996 --> 01:28:38.873
and the Raisuli
and his followers

01:28:39.123 --> 01:28:41.083
are to be granted
the freedom to travel

01:28:41.292 --> 01:28:43.043
in the cities
and marketplaces.

01:28:43.252 --> 01:28:43.961
And last

01:28:44.211 --> 01:28:47.006
all those held in the
dungeons of Mogador

01:28:47.214 --> 01:28:48.799
who swear fealty
to Raisuli

01:28:49.008 --> 01:28:51.302
shall be placed
under Raisuli's care.

01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:53.179
This in return

01:28:53.387 --> 01:28:56.223
for the American woman
and her children.

01:28:57.641 --> 01:29:00.144
It is the word of the
American Sultan Roosevelt

01:29:00.352 --> 01:29:01.729
and his honor.

01:29:02.938 --> 01:29:06.567
Even with treachery,
such an offer is impressive.

01:29:10.946 --> 01:29:14.909
The American Bashaw wished
that the Raisuli act in haste

01:29:15.117 --> 01:29:17.411
as the other Europeans
are not pleased.

01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:19.246
You must take their offer.

01:29:19.455 --> 01:29:20.789
Each day that
you keep us here

01:29:20.998 --> 01:29:23.918
the Europeans use as an
excuse to land more troops.

01:29:24.168 --> 01:29:26.754
Everything that you have
fought for is wasted.

01:29:27.087 --> 01:29:29.131
They are using you, Raisuli.

01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:30.758
You are becoming
a dupe to them.

01:29:30.966 --> 01:29:32.843
Do not call the
Raisuli a dupe.

01:29:33.302 --> 01:29:35.137
I do not need the
counsel of women.

01:29:35.346 --> 01:29:37.306
The American woman is true.

01:29:37.515 --> 01:29:39.767
Every day, more
Germans travel to Fez.

01:29:39.975 --> 01:29:42.186
They have guns that
need wheels to carry them.

01:29:42.394 --> 01:29:44.021
What is stopping you?

01:29:44.230 --> 01:29:45.481
Can't you see?

01:29:45.689 --> 01:29:48.067
It is no longer our concern.

01:29:48.692 --> 01:29:50.528
The great powers want this land

01:29:50.736 --> 01:29:52.154
and they will fight each
other to take this land

01:29:52.363 --> 01:29:54.031
and when they are done,
there will be nothing.

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.908
Not your mountains,
nor your palace

01:29:56.116 --> 01:29:57.576
not pride, nor
your honor.

01:29:57.785 --> 01:30:00.579
It is a wind so strong
no tree can stand in it.

01:30:00.788 --> 01:30:04.750
And where there are no trees,
there is no shade from the sun.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.127
And what is land without
shade from the sun?

01:30:07.586 --> 01:30:08.629
Desert.

01:30:09.547 --> 01:30:12.258
The desert
I know very well.

01:30:12.466 --> 01:30:15.928
Mrs. Pedecaris, you
speak like a Berber.

01:30:16.345 --> 01:30:18.305
It must be the heat.

01:30:19.682 --> 01:30:21.642
Why do you do this?

01:30:22.935 --> 01:30:26.105
I do not ordinarily ask
the counsel of any man

01:30:26.313 --> 01:30:27.940
let alone the
counsel of women.

01:30:29.233 --> 01:30:31.110
You're not even
one of my wives.

01:30:35.072 --> 01:30:37.116
I should certainly say not.

01:30:37.324 --> 01:30:39.535
I am not.

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.787
Children, come here.

01:30:44.206 --> 01:30:45.916
We have no more business here.

01:30:46.125 --> 01:30:47.876
Let these brigands
decide for themselves

01:30:48.085 --> 01:30:49.295
what they shall do with us.

01:30:49.503 --> 01:30:52.798
Mrs. Pedecaris, I have
decided it would please me

01:30:53.007 --> 01:30:54.925
to return you to
President Roosevelt

01:30:55.134 --> 01:30:57.094
because you're
a lot of trouble.

01:30:58.429 --> 01:30:59.888
Perhaps he will know
what to do with you.

01:31:00.097 --> 01:31:02.016
It is not my fate to find out.

01:31:10.899 --> 01:31:12.526
Even you laugh
at the Raisuli.

01:31:12.735 --> 01:31:15.112
This woman has
taken the Raisuli.

01:31:16.155 --> 01:31:18.574
You say such things
in front of my men.

01:31:19.241 --> 01:31:21.910
What has become
of honor, respect?

01:31:22.578 --> 01:31:25.289
Everything is changing,
drifting away on the wind.

01:31:27.416 --> 01:31:29.001
It's been a bad year.

01:31:30.002 --> 01:31:32.379
The next one will
probably be worse.

01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:37.009
Where do we have to
take them to get our gold?

01:31:37.217 --> 01:31:39.345
I will take them. You
need not risk your life.

01:31:39.553 --> 01:31:42.598
What does my life matter?
I've nothing else to do.

01:31:43.307 --> 01:31:44.767
Prepare to ride.

01:32:31.647 --> 01:32:33.649
I do not understand
this woman.

01:32:34.692 --> 01:32:38.320
My entire education has
been horses and the Koran.

01:32:38.946 --> 01:32:40.114
What have I learned?

01:32:40.614 --> 01:32:41.490
Look what I've become.

01:32:41.699 --> 01:32:43.450
You are Lord of the Rif.

01:32:43.659 --> 01:32:46.453
Yes, and you would think
I would understand this woman.

01:32:48.872 --> 01:32:50.708
Where is it exactly
where we are going?

01:32:50.958 --> 01:32:54.503
To a small village east of Rabat
at the foot of the mountains.

01:32:54.712 --> 01:32:55.879
It is good.

01:32:56.088 --> 01:32:57.172
What is good?

01:32:57.381 --> 01:32:59.550
It is good to know
where we are going.

01:34:37.147 --> 01:34:38.148
What are
they singing?

01:34:38.857 --> 01:34:40.651
They are singing
songs to God.

01:34:41.485 --> 01:34:43.153
Why are you
not singing?

01:34:43.695 --> 01:34:46.031
I am the Sultan.
They do the singing.

01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:47.950
That is ridiculous.

01:34:48.784 --> 01:34:50.285
It is customary.

01:34:51.745 --> 01:34:54.289
There is just one
thing I'd like to ask you.

01:34:54.498 --> 01:34:55.874
Yes, what is it?

01:34:56.375 --> 01:34:58.168
What is your first name?

01:34:58.877 --> 01:35:00.128
My first name?

01:35:00.546 --> 01:35:02.381
Yes, your Christian name.

01:35:02.589 --> 01:35:04.716
I mean what is the name

01:35:04.925 --> 01:35:07.177
that precedes all
your other names?

01:35:07.386 --> 01:35:10.013
My first name?
My Christian name?

01:35:10.472 --> 01:35:12.808
I am Mulay Achmed Mohammed

01:35:13.016 --> 01:35:15.227
Raisuli the Magnificent,
Lord of the Rif.

01:35:15.435 --> 01:35:17.688
Mulay. Mulay,
that is a nice name.

01:35:18.188 --> 01:35:19.189
Yes.

01:35:19.398 --> 01:35:20.399
Mulay.

01:35:21.149 --> 01:35:23.026
I am Eden, Mulay.

01:35:24.778 --> 01:35:25.737
Eden.

01:35:27.614 --> 01:35:28.574
Of course.

01:35:54.808 --> 01:35:55.976
You need not
go any further.

01:35:56.518 --> 01:35:58.312
My retainers will
bring back the gold.

01:35:59.021 --> 01:36:00.606
What good is the word
of the Roosevelt

01:36:01.023 --> 01:36:03.025
if it is not met by the
word of the Raisuli?

01:36:03.734 --> 01:36:05.527
My brother knows this.

01:36:06.028 --> 01:36:08.030
I do not fear
treachery or fate.

01:36:08.363 --> 01:36:09.489
I fear only God.

01:36:09.865 --> 01:36:11.950
It is foolish and silly
to talk as such.

01:36:12.451 --> 01:36:13.660
These Europeans
are not men.

01:36:14.119 --> 01:36:15.746
They do not respect
the laws of men.

01:36:16.330 --> 01:36:17.331
Let me take
the woman.

01:36:17.539 --> 01:36:19.583
He is right. It is no
longer your concern.

01:36:19.917 --> 01:36:21.501
No longer my concern?

01:36:22.085 --> 01:36:23.462
It is I who took you.

01:36:23.712 --> 01:36:25.255
It pleased me to do so.

01:36:25.464 --> 01:36:27.466
It pleases me now
to bring you back.

01:36:28.342 --> 01:36:29.551
No longer my concern.

01:36:29.968 --> 01:36:31.470
Sherif, bring your retainers.

01:36:40.437 --> 01:36:43.315
The woman Pedecaris
must not be endangered.

01:36:43.565 --> 01:36:45.651
She must return to
President Roosevelt.

01:36:46.276 --> 01:36:48.362
If there is to be treachery,

01:36:48.570 --> 01:36:51.198
Allah will not leave my
side, but you must.

01:36:51.448 --> 01:36:52.616
Ride back.

01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:55.410
Lead the <i>mahalla.</i>
Let there be jihad.

01:36:56.453 --> 01:36:59.081
Let the swords run with
the blood of the infidels.

01:36:59.498 --> 01:37:01.625
We will all eat
lamb in paradise.

01:37:47.129 --> 01:37:48.296
Throw down your arms.

01:37:48.964 --> 01:37:51.758
They obey only my will,
and I am the Raisuli.

01:38:09.359 --> 01:38:10.444
I am Mrs. Pedecaris.

01:38:10.652 --> 01:38:13.530
I do not intend to have my family
endangered any further.

01:38:13.739 --> 01:38:14.489
Mrs. Pedecaris.

01:38:14.698 --> 01:38:16.074
Capt. Jerome,
U.S. Marine Corps.

01:38:16.283 --> 01:38:17.659
- Help the children.
-Yes, ma'am.

01:38:29.504 --> 01:38:31.006
Better take cover inside, ma'am.

01:38:38.513 --> 01:38:40.557
Inside. Inside.

01:38:45.228 --> 01:38:46.772
I am the Sherif of Wazan.

01:38:47.064 --> 01:38:48.648
These are my retainers.

01:38:49.107 --> 01:38:51.443
They do not ride
with this brigand.

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:53.320
Take him if you want.

01:39:01.995 --> 01:39:03.538
What will they do to him?

01:39:03.747 --> 01:39:05.332
That can't be
our concern, ma'am.

01:39:06.249 --> 01:39:08.001
We're quite
outnumbered here.

01:39:20.597 --> 01:39:21.598
Let's go inside.

01:39:25.685 --> 01:39:28.563
I expect gold and
rifles for his head.

01:39:29.272 --> 01:39:31.149
I do not do this
for a lackey's wages.

01:40:02.097 --> 01:40:03.306
Can't we get
out of here?

01:40:03.723 --> 01:40:05.100
Not until it's
light, ma'am.

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:08.436
I wouldn't trust these
sorts in the dark.

01:41:58.505 --> 01:41:59.381
Mother.

01:42:00.090 --> 01:42:02.592
Mother, aren't you going to do
anything about the Raisuli?

01:42:02.926 --> 01:42:05.720
William, the Raisuli
is not our concern.

01:42:06.221 --> 01:42:08.014
Aren't you going to do
anything about him?

01:42:08.306 --> 01:42:09.766
Go to sleep, William.

01:42:10.058 --> 01:42:10.809
Mother.

01:42:11.059 --> 01:42:11.893
William.

01:43:23.381 --> 01:43:24.758
William.

01:43:25.884 --> 01:43:28.136
William, have you
got your dagger?

01:43:38.813 --> 01:43:39.773
Captain?

01:43:40.857 --> 01:43:41.858
Captain!

01:43:42.692 --> 01:43:44.652
Could you bring us
some water, please?

01:43:45.362 --> 01:43:46.321
Of course, ma'am.

01:43:50.617 --> 01:43:51.576
Here we go.

01:43:52.494 --> 01:43:54.871
For the boy first, Captain.
He has a fever.

01:43:55.330 --> 01:43:56.915
Here, son, hold
your head up.

01:43:57.165 --> 01:43:58.124
There we go.

01:43:58.500 --> 01:43:59.501
Oh, man!

01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:01.753
Don't any of you move!

01:44:02.170 --> 01:44:03.922
I shall cut this man's throat
as surely as you stand there

01:44:04.130 --> 01:44:05.924
if you do not do
exactly as I say.

01:44:06.132 --> 01:44:08.635
I am not fooling! Now
drop those weapons.

01:44:08.927 --> 01:44:10.178
You know, you
could hurt somebody--

01:44:10.387 --> 01:44:12.305
Don't touch that.
William, get them.

01:44:12.514 --> 01:44:13.807
Jennifer, help him.
Get the pistols, too.

01:44:27.529 --> 01:44:29.197
William, give me
the short one.

01:44:35.954 --> 01:44:36.955
Get up.

01:44:38.123 --> 01:44:39.499
Now, easy with
that thing, ma'am.

01:44:39.749 --> 01:44:42.669
I have shot grouse in Scotland
and quail in North Carolina.

01:44:42.877 --> 01:44:44.963
Believe me, I know
how to use this thing.

01:44:45.255 --> 01:44:47.507
Just what are you trying
to do, Mrs. Pedecaris?

01:44:47.715 --> 01:44:48.967
Just what are you
trying to get across?

01:44:49.175 --> 01:44:50.760
Now, President Roosevelt
made an agreement

01:44:51.010 --> 01:44:52.387
with that man being
held over there

01:44:52.595 --> 01:44:54.722
and President Roosevelt
keeps his agreements.

01:44:54.931 --> 01:44:56.057
Now, there's no
need to do this.

01:44:56.266 --> 01:44:57.767
We're all
Americans here.

01:44:58.601 --> 01:45:00.186
What exactly did
you have in mind?

01:45:00.395 --> 01:45:02.605
I intend to free the Raisuli.

01:45:03.356 --> 01:45:04.357
Alone, I suppose.

01:45:04.566 --> 01:45:05.817
With my children.

01:45:06.192 --> 01:45:09.195
Well, now, ma'am, I wish you'd
said that in the first place

01:45:09.404 --> 01:45:11.406
because if you're going to try
it alone with your children,

01:45:12.157 --> 01:45:13.491
you haven't got a chance.

01:45:13.867 --> 01:45:16.244
What do you suggest I do, then?

01:45:16.494 --> 01:45:17.495
Captain?

01:45:19.205 --> 01:45:20.707
I'd like to throw
in with you

01:45:21.332 --> 01:45:22.625
and God help us.

01:45:24.502 --> 01:45:25.920
Draw your weapons
from the boy here.

01:45:32.927 --> 01:45:34.095
Check for a full load.

01:45:34.512 --> 01:45:35.847
My pistol, please.

01:47:03.768 --> 01:47:04.644
Halt!

01:47:12.485 --> 01:47:13.695
We want to see
your prisoner.

01:47:19.284 --> 01:47:21.202
I said, we want to
see your prisoner.

01:47:24.038 --> 01:47:25.290
We want to see
the Raisuli.

01:47:25.582 --> 01:47:26.874
President Roosevelt
negotiated in good faith--

01:47:28.501 --> 01:47:29.794
What do think
you're doing?

01:48:16.090 --> 01:48:17.133
Let's go.

01:48:17.467 --> 01:48:18.718
Hurry up! Cover us.

01:50:13.666 --> 01:50:14.792
Oh, my God.

01:50:15.042 --> 01:50:16.377
Oh, Mrs. Pedecaris.

01:50:17.211 --> 01:50:18.713
The Baraka has
not deserted me.

01:50:20.715 --> 01:50:22.508
Cut me down quick
before it does.

01:50:25.762 --> 01:50:27.013
The sword, woman!

01:50:27.555 --> 01:50:28.598
The sword!

01:50:31.267 --> 01:50:32.059
Better.

01:50:35.938 --> 01:50:36.898
Oh, my--

01:50:37.106 --> 01:50:38.107
Are you hurt?

01:50:38.691 --> 01:50:41.527
Mrs. Pedecaris,
you're a lot of trouble.

01:51:34.497 --> 01:51:35.289
Whoo!

01:51:46.467 --> 01:51:48.219
I'll see you again,
Mrs. Pedecaris

01:51:48.594 --> 01:51:51.013
when we're both like
golden clouds on the wind.

01:54:23.624 --> 01:54:25.710
There was
nothing to worry about, John.

01:54:26.419 --> 01:54:28.629
All I have to do is go to
Oyster Bay for the weekend

01:54:28.838 --> 01:54:30.840
and the government
of Morocco falls.

01:54:32.258 --> 01:54:34.051
By the way, how
is Mrs. Pedecaris?

01:54:34.260 --> 01:54:35.636
Oh, she's in
fine health, sir.

01:54:35.845 --> 01:54:37.013
Quite a remarkable woman.

01:54:37.263 --> 01:54:38.347
According to Capt. Jerome,

01:54:38.556 --> 01:54:41.642
during the fighting at Ar Sarib, she
displayed commendable courage.

01:54:41.892 --> 01:54:43.352
Yes, so did that Jerome, boy.

01:54:43.561 --> 01:54:44.895
I want to see him
decorated with something.

01:54:45.104 --> 01:54:46.731
Whatever you think
is appropriate.

01:54:46.939 --> 01:54:49.275
And Gummere and, what's
his name? The other fellow--

01:54:49.483 --> 01:54:50.985
Well, decorate the
whole outfit, all of them.

01:54:51.193 --> 01:54:53.988
I must say, Theodore, you
should thank your lucky stars.

01:54:54.238 --> 01:54:55.865
Why, luck had nothing
to do with it, John.

01:54:56.073 --> 01:54:57.366
I had God on my side.

01:54:57.825 --> 01:54:58.784
Maybe Allah.

01:55:00.786 --> 01:55:01.787
What's that?

01:55:01.996 --> 01:55:04.331
Well, that's your bear.
Your grizzly bear, sir.

01:55:04.874 --> 01:55:07.626
First reports are we can get
anything we want in Morocco, sir.

01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:10.963
Coaling rights. We can put
anybody we want on the throne.

01:55:11.172 --> 01:55:12.882
Their camps were divided.
It's as simple as that.

01:55:13.090 --> 01:55:15.134
At this moment, Theodore is
the most popular President

01:55:15.342 --> 01:55:16.427
in the history of the office.

01:55:16.635 --> 01:55:17.553
Take that cover off.

01:55:17.762 --> 01:55:18.679
What, sir?

01:55:18.888 --> 01:55:20.598
Take the cover off.
I want to see my bear.

01:55:20.806 --> 01:55:22.266
Later perhaps, Theodore.

01:55:22.475 --> 01:55:24.185
No, I want to see him now.

01:55:25.519 --> 01:55:28.230
A good speech would be appropriate
in the next few days, sir.

01:55:28.439 --> 01:55:29.940
Even the papers
are cheering you.

01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:33.277
There's no doubt about the
outcome of the election, Theodore.

01:55:41.202 --> 01:55:42.161
Gentlemen

01:55:43.329 --> 01:55:46.957
nothing in this world is certain,
absolutely nothing.

01:55:47.166 --> 01:55:50.544
The fate of the nation will be decided
by the American people in November

01:55:51.087 --> 01:55:54.507
and the fate of Morocco will
be decided tomorrow by me.

01:55:54.965 --> 01:55:56.425
Now, gentlemen,

01:55:56.675 --> 01:55:59.762
if you don't mind, I'd just like
to be alone with my bear.

01:56:00.846 --> 01:56:03.891
I trust he was a Democrat.

01:56:40.928 --> 01:56:42.596
<i>To Theodore Roosevelt.</i>

01:56:44.181 --> 01:56:46.559
<i>You are like the wind</i>

01:56:46.767 --> 01:56:48.686
<i>and I, like the lion.</i>

01:56:49.603 --> 01:56:51.021
<i>You form the tempest.</i>

01:56:51.397 --> 01:56:54.608
<i>The sand stings my eyes,
and the ground is parched.</i>

01:56:55.151 --> 01:56:58.737
<i>I roar in defiance,
but you do not hear.</i>

01:56:59.697 --> 01:57:01.866
<i>But between us,
there is a difference.</i>

01:57:02.116 --> 01:57:06.036
<i>I, like the lion, must
remain in my place</i>

01:57:06.537 --> 01:57:11.041
<i>while you, like the wind,
will never know yours.</i>

01:57:12.418 --> 01:57:17.840
<i>Mulay Achmed Mohammed
el-Raisuli the Magnificent</i>

01:57:18.132 --> 01:57:19.717
<i>Lord of the Rif</i>

01:57:19.925 --> 01:57:21.802
<i>Sultan to the Berbers.</i>

01:57:25.431 --> 01:57:28.809
Great Raisuli,
we have lost everything.

01:57:29.185 --> 01:57:31.979
All is drifting on the
wind just as you said.

01:57:32.855 --> 01:57:34.732
We have lost everything.

01:57:35.274 --> 01:57:38.485
Sherif, is there not
one thing in your life

01:57:38.777 --> 01:57:41.363
that was worth
losing everything for?

01:57:42.305 --> 01:57:48.846
