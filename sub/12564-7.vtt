00:01.041 --> 00:02.854
<i>Previously, on</i>
Royal Pains...

00:02.886 --> 00:05.370
- I know you're talking to Dr. Van Dyke.
- Mm-hmm.

00:05.471 --> 00:07.371
But does that mean you're done
talking to Hankmed?

00:07.473 --> 00:09.306
Well, it depends
on what Hankmed is saying.

00:09.308 --> 00:10.691
Forget tomorrow.

00:10.693 --> 00:12.593
I'll have my attorney
look over the contract tonight.

00:12.595 --> 00:16.530
Do you know if there is any
history of M.S. in your family?

00:16.532 --> 00:18.032
I'm the first.

00:18.034 --> 00:20.501
I share more than a
surname with Boris.

00:20.503 --> 00:23.120
He continues to push
for access to Shadow Pond.

00:23.122 --> 00:24.705
Whatever he wants
seems to be there.

00:24.707 --> 00:26.457
There may be a clinical
trial available

00:26.459 --> 00:28.709
for your condition.

00:28.711 --> 00:30.277
Once we finalize the protocols,

00:30.279 --> 00:33.280
this will walk, talk, and smell
like a real clinical trial.

00:33.282 --> 00:35.583
So the trap is nearly set.

00:35.585 --> 00:36.801
I didn't have a crush on Divya.

00:36.803 --> 00:38.118
I was in love with her.

00:38.120 --> 00:39.786
I'm officially homeless.

00:39.788 --> 00:44.859
Front door, back door,
deadbolt, garage.

01:16.759 --> 01:18.375
Hello.

01:18.377 --> 01:20.377
Hello.

01:20.379 --> 01:21.929
Did I wake you up? I am so sorry.

01:21.931 --> 01:24.632
No, it's, uh...
I'm a light... light sleeper.

01:24.634 --> 01:27.668
I'll try to be quieter next time.

01:27.670 --> 01:31.672
Would you like
a cup of hot cocoa?

01:31.674 --> 01:33.474
Always helps me sleep.

01:33.476 --> 01:35.976
Uh, I already brushed my teeth.

01:49.457 --> 01:53.627
Jeremiah, I found this plant
and my cashmere throw

01:53.629 --> 01:54.662
outside my bedroom door.

01:54.664 --> 01:56.747
Yes, you left them down here.

01:56.749 --> 01:59.583
Oh, I thought they made things
feel a little homier.

02:02.387 --> 02:04.305
I can keep them in my room.

02:04.307 --> 02:05.872
It'll make it feel homier up there.

02:05.874 --> 02:08.559
Thank you. Good night.

02:08.561 --> 02:10.176
Good night.

02:10.179 --> 02:13.314
And thank you again, so much,
for letting me stay here.

02:26.912 --> 02:29.363
Look, I understand that
this is inconvenient for you,

02:29.365 --> 02:30.698
but the parameters are strict

02:30.700 --> 02:33.200
for the first phase
of the clinical trial.

02:33.202 --> 02:34.702
Milos?

02:34.704 --> 02:36.620
Why can't you come to Budapest?

02:36.622 --> 02:41.742
The research team requires
participants to be in the U.S.

02:41.744 --> 02:43.711
To ask those with weak
bones and muscles

02:43.713 --> 02:46.246
to travel such long distances
seems ill-conceived.

02:46.248 --> 02:48.349
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:48.351 --> 02:51.084
But at the request
of the principal investigator,

02:51.086 --> 02:53.420
the blood and muscle biopsies
must take place

02:53.422 --> 02:54.855
at the trial's location.

02:54.857 --> 02:57.524
Hank, it seems foolish
to travel so far

02:57.526 --> 02:59.193
with no guarantee of success.

02:59.195 --> 03:01.395
Henry, Henry. Auction.

03:01.397 --> 03:04.732
This is the most promising
protocol I've seen.

03:04.734 --> 03:06.433
Milos, if there's anything else
you'd like to discuss,

03:06.435 --> 03:07.434
please let me know.

03:07.436 --> 03:08.769
I am happy to help.

03:08.771 --> 03:10.154
Yeah, happy to help
get you arrested,

03:10.156 --> 03:12.823
you big, fat murderer.

03:12.825 --> 03:14.992
Thank you, Hank.

03:14.994 --> 03:18.462
I will let you know
if there's anything else I need.

03:25.119 --> 03:26.253
You didn't tell him
about the auction.

03:26.255 --> 03:27.554
No, I didn't.

03:27.556 --> 03:28.806
Henry, I thought the plan
was to find out

03:28.808 --> 03:30.557
what he's looking
for at Shadow Pond.

03:30.559 --> 03:32.509
I just want him to get
on that plane next week.

03:32.511 --> 03:33.594
Boris is handling the auction.

03:33.596 --> 03:35.145
Okay, good,

03:35.147 --> 03:36.930
'cause Paige has been working
dawn to dusk,

03:36.932 --> 03:39.066
cataloguing everything
in the castle.

03:39.068 --> 03:40.484
I'd be over there helping her,

03:40.486 --> 03:41.652
but I have a "Q" and "A"
at the Y.M.C.A.,

03:41.654 --> 03:44.137
followed by a meet and greet
at the U.J.A.

03:44.139 --> 03:45.272
It's campaign events.

03:45.274 --> 03:46.323
Yeah, that's probably for the best.

03:46.325 --> 03:48.025
I'm sure Paige and her associates

03:48.027 --> 03:49.443
know what they're doing.

03:49.445 --> 03:50.477
Yeah. Talk about a win-win.

03:50.479 --> 03:52.029
Boris finds out what
Milos is after,

03:52.031 --> 03:53.914
and my wife brings in a ton
of money for her auction house.

03:53.916 --> 03:55.332
Plus, Boris gets to
buy all new stuff.

03:55.334 --> 03:56.917
So, actually, it's a win-win-win.

03:56.919 --> 03:59.286
All right.

03:59.288 --> 04:01.839
Will they be done cataloguing
by next Friday?

04:01.841 --> 04:03.674
I mean, we need
to send Milos the catalogue

04:03.676 --> 04:05.125
before he gets on a plane.

04:05.127 --> 04:07.628
Yeah, they'll definitely
be done in time.

04:07.630 --> 04:10.097
- We'll never be done in time.
- Oh, please.

04:10.099 --> 04:11.098
Walk with me.

04:11.100 --> 04:12.666
Nicole, more side lighting.

04:12.668 --> 04:15.269
This is Sutton and Chesterfield,
not Craigslist.

04:15.271 --> 04:17.103
I've had tighter
deadlines than this.

04:17.106 --> 04:20.057
Johann Baptist, without the "e."

04:20.059 --> 04:22.342
He wasn't Haitian.

04:22.344 --> 04:25.446
I did christie Brinkley's
estate... twice.

04:30.569 --> 04:33.120
I love the smell of linseed
in the morning.

04:33.122 --> 04:35.188
Should I ask the Hollands
to mail their check

04:35.190 --> 04:36.990
from last week's estate auction?

04:36.992 --> 04:38.992
They asked me to stop by
and pick it up in person...

04:38.994 --> 04:41.295
the Hollands took a shine to you?

04:41.297 --> 04:43.580
Go on your lunch hour. Giuseppe.

04:43.582 --> 04:45.666
I have a lunch hour?

04:45.668 --> 04:47.051
You're on speaker, Ken.

04:47.053 --> 04:48.585
Guys, this is a big deal.

04:48.587 --> 04:50.754
No more are you the little
concierge business that could.

04:50.756 --> 04:52.673
You are being acquired
by Symphony Health.

04:52.675 --> 04:54.875
That's a big company
with big pockets.

04:54.877 --> 04:57.428
Killer Keller's gonna
slide you a big signing bonus.

04:57.430 --> 04:59.396
Wha... we're not Carmelo Anthony.

04:59.398 --> 05:00.764
Ev, you're with me, right?

05:00.766 --> 05:01.849
I mean, you've got a wife now.

05:01.851 --> 05:04.551
She's gonna want to buy things.

05:04.553 --> 05:06.153
Show me the money.

05:06.155 --> 05:08.939
Okay, so why are we still
arguing about paragraph 2B?

05:08.941 --> 05:11.608
No, no, 2B is not just
Hankmed staff parking.

05:11.610 --> 05:13.410
2B is for your patients, too.

05:13.412 --> 05:15.829
You want them to have
easy access to you

05:15.831 --> 05:17.114
- wherever you are, right?
- Makes sense.

05:17.116 --> 05:18.749
Good point.

05:18.751 --> 05:21.251
Ken, what are you doing?
Your breathing sounds labored.

05:21.253 --> 05:22.536
I'm... I'm fine.

05:22.538 --> 05:24.538
Listen, let's move on
to paragraph three.

05:24.540 --> 05:26.924
Okay, the performance clause.

05:26.926 --> 05:29.409
So Symphony says
bonuses are dependent

05:29.411 --> 05:30.911
on revenue-based goals.

05:30.913 --> 05:32.262
You're gonna have to dig deep

05:32.264 --> 05:34.047
mentally as well as physically
today, riders.

05:34.049 --> 05:35.849
We need to inquire
about their marketing efforts

05:35.851 --> 05:37.017
in the event original
Hankmed patients

05:37.019 --> 05:39.019
- start to thin out.
- Do you mind?

05:39.021 --> 05:40.387
No, not at all.

05:40.389 --> 05:42.639
Get off your phone.

05:42.641 --> 05:45.258
It's not my fault my time
is more valuable than yours.

05:45.260 --> 05:46.393
Who is he talking to?

05:46.395 --> 05:47.978
It's Keller. It could be his mom.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.948
All right, this hill
is going to kill you,

05:50.950 --> 05:52.533
and it's a good thing. Punch it.

05:52.535 --> 05:53.534
Bring it on, Ben.

05:53.536 --> 05:54.651
Oh, please.

05:54.653 --> 05:56.320
Hey, douchebag.

06:10.669 --> 06:13.303
- Whoa!
- Ken?

06:13.305 --> 06:15.055
Ken, are you okay?

06:17.422 --> 06:21.222

06:25.992 --> 06:28.776
All right, last stretch.
Give me all you got.

06:28.778 --> 06:31.796
Three, two, one, sprint!

06:33.049 --> 06:35.250
I think you might be overdoing it.

06:35.252 --> 06:36.617
This guy obviously felt threatened

06:36.619 --> 06:37.669
because I was leading the pack.

06:37.671 --> 06:39.754
You were on a stationary bike.

06:39.756 --> 06:41.389
People shouldn't push themselves

06:41.391 --> 06:42.674
beyond their capabilities
when they spin.

06:42.676 --> 06:44.676
Not everybody can
be an elite rider.

06:44.678 --> 06:46.177
I assume that's why you run.

06:46.179 --> 06:47.345
But you should give it a try, Hank.

06:47.347 --> 06:49.147
We got another
two-hour class this weekend.

06:49.149 --> 06:50.965
Don't worry, you can dial down
the resistance to zero.

06:50.967 --> 06:52.233
No one's gonna know.

06:52.235 --> 06:53.601
Thank you so much.

06:53.603 --> 06:55.320
Maybe Hankmed should get a lawyer

06:55.322 --> 06:57.405
who doesn't do his negotiating
out of a health club.

06:57.407 --> 06:58.656
What are you talking about?

06:58.658 --> 06:59.991
You should be grateful
that your in-house counsel

06:59.993 --> 07:01.776
is also part Hankmed owner,

07:01.778 --> 07:04.195
not to mention an incredibly
successful uber agent.

07:04.197 --> 07:06.197
You want a lucrative deal,
I am your guy.

07:06.199 --> 07:07.949
Hey, there's your bus ad.

07:07.951 --> 07:09.501
I look forward
to finding out the bottom line

07:09.503 --> 07:11.503
tomorrow, when I see Shelby.

07:11.505 --> 07:12.820
She called you?

07:12.822 --> 07:14.172
What did she say?
Tell me everything.

07:14.174 --> 07:15.256
Well, she called to ask if
I could come in for a meeting.

07:15.258 --> 07:16.424
That was it.

07:16.426 --> 07:17.592
Oh, no, no, no. Rookie mistake.

07:17.594 --> 07:19.044
You and Evan do not see her

07:19.046 --> 07:20.595
without me present
while we're negotiating.

07:20.597 --> 07:21.963
Evan won't be there.

07:21.965 --> 07:23.164
He'll be on a State
of the Dunes tour.

07:23.166 --> 07:25.050
- Wait, a what?
- A State of the Dunes...

07:25.052 --> 07:26.518
That was rhetorical.
I so don't care.

07:26.520 --> 07:27.852
Look, here's the bottom line.

07:27.854 --> 07:30.055
I am the hard shell.
You're the soft underbelly.

07:30.057 --> 07:31.723
- I'm a big boy, Ken.
- Oh, yeah?

07:31.725 --> 07:33.191
Well, how are you gonna answer
when she asks

07:33.193 --> 07:34.809
if she can have an amendment
stating that you will weigh in

07:34.811 --> 07:37.445
on complicated cases
at regional Symphony hospitals?

07:37.447 --> 07:39.447
Considering I'm a doctor,
and I took an oath...

07:39.449 --> 07:40.949
Wrong.

07:40.951 --> 07:42.517
You ask if you're getting
reimbursed for gas,

07:42.519 --> 07:45.070
not to mention wear and tear
on that piece of crap you drive.

07:45.072 --> 07:46.071
Ow!

07:46.073 --> 07:48.823
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

07:48.825 --> 07:51.126
Your work better not
leave a scar, big boy.

07:52.745 --> 07:57.749
All right, I hope you're all
exhilarated but exhausted.

07:57.751 --> 07:58.750
Nice work.

07:58.752 --> 08:00.835
Hey, Ken.

08:00.837 --> 08:03.254
You have to abide
by the rules of the road.

08:03.256 --> 08:05.723
- No more phones in class.
- He's right.

08:05.725 --> 08:07.642
Thank you!

08:07.644 --> 08:10.895
No, it wasn't my fault.
I told him not to call me here.

08:10.897 --> 08:12.730
I don't really know him.

08:16.185 --> 08:18.653
Sorry I was so dramatic
when I called.

08:18.655 --> 08:20.155
Wendy, the packaging looks great.

08:20.157 --> 08:22.357
Tomorrow, will you please
show me the secret

08:22.359 --> 08:24.392
to getting your caramel
that perfect golden shade

08:24.394 --> 08:25.660
every time you make it?

08:25.662 --> 08:28.997
There's no secret.
It's just instinct.

08:28.999 --> 08:32.667
Is that 1/8 of a teaspoon that
you're drizzling on each one?

08:32.669 --> 08:36.254
I don't measure it.
I just know when it's right.

08:36.256 --> 08:38.756
Okay. That's done.

08:38.758 --> 08:40.908
And since you didn't
come here to learn

08:40.909 --> 08:42.260
how to make a perfect caramel,

08:42.261 --> 08:44.245
um, back to me.

08:44.246 --> 08:46.431
I think I was having a panic attack

08:46.433 --> 08:48.516
when I called you earlier.

08:48.518 --> 08:49.517
I, um... my chest
felt a little tight.

08:49.519 --> 08:50.969
That's a symptom, right?

08:50.971 --> 08:52.353
Or maybe I was panicking
because my chest felt tight.

08:52.355 --> 08:54.255
Anyway, I feel fine now.

08:54.257 --> 08:56.191
I'm really sorry
for wasting your time, Divya.

08:56.193 --> 08:57.925
It is not a problem.

08:57.927 --> 08:59.611
Since I'm here,
why don't I check your vitals?

08:59.613 --> 09:02.697
Okay.

09:05.784 --> 09:07.535
You know, the last time I was here,

09:07.537 --> 09:09.904
you were just moving in.

09:09.906 --> 09:11.739
And now it looks
like you've lived here forever.

09:11.741 --> 09:13.825
Your kitchen is just charming.

09:13.827 --> 09:16.911
It's like the perfect little...

09:16.913 --> 09:18.946
Perfect little nest.

09:21.083 --> 09:22.550
Um, how are you?

09:22.552 --> 09:24.586
Are you still seeing
the polo player

09:24.588 --> 09:26.638
you were so into last summer?

09:26.640 --> 09:30.291
No. No, it was a short romance.

09:30.293 --> 09:35.730
Your blood pressure is fine.
Let's take your temperature.

09:35.732 --> 09:38.766
So how's your business going?

09:38.768 --> 09:40.318
Thousands of pounds of candy later,

09:40.320 --> 09:43.188
it's expanding from East Hampton
to the Upper East Side,

09:43.190 --> 09:44.405
and everywhere in between.

09:44.407 --> 09:47.141
Oh, my gosh, that's wonderful.
Congratulations.

09:47.143 --> 09:48.776
Yeah, and stressful.

09:48.778 --> 09:50.445
These are not done right.

09:50.447 --> 09:53.781
I'm in the process, actually,
of hiring a confectioner

09:53.783 --> 09:57.202
and website designer and a P.R.
person.

09:57.204 --> 09:59.671
I don't know, all these new people

09:59.673 --> 10:02.123
are kind of making me
feel a little bit...

10:02.125 --> 10:04.842
Panicky?

10:04.844 --> 10:06.928
Yeah.

10:06.930 --> 10:09.597
I started this business
so I could work for myself,

10:09.599 --> 10:10.798
you know, by myself.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.518
Now I'm gonna be the boss.

10:13.520 --> 10:14.769
Me.

10:14.771 --> 10:16.688
And I don't know how
this is gonna go down,

10:16.690 --> 10:18.439
because all the
recipes are in here.

10:18.441 --> 10:22.777
I know by taste, not a timer,
when each piece is done,

10:22.779 --> 10:26.447
and every piece is a
work of art to me.

10:28.534 --> 10:31.686
How do you teach that to people?

10:31.688 --> 10:33.571
I don't know.

10:33.573 --> 10:35.823
But I do know that
you don't have a temperature.

10:35.825 --> 10:39.294
Your heart rate is a little
fast, but within normal range.

10:39.296 --> 10:41.862
It sounds like you have a lot
to be excited about.

10:41.864 --> 10:44.832
But if you get too excited,
please give me a call?

10:44.834 --> 10:48.086
Will do.

10:48.088 --> 10:50.221
Chocolate peanut caramel explosion?

10:50.223 --> 10:53.391
I thought you'd never ask.

10:56.512 --> 10:58.229
Mmm.

10:58.231 --> 11:01.933
Ugh, redo it.

11:01.935 --> 11:04.185
- <i>Pour vous.</i>
<i>- Merci beaucoup.</i>

11:04.187 --> 11:06.654
<i>Et possiblement pour moi.</i>

11:06.656 --> 11:07.722
<i>The Red Square.</i>

11:07.724 --> 11:09.190
When I went to pick up the check,

11:09.192 --> 11:10.575
the Hollands offered
to sell it to me

11:10.577 --> 11:12.610
for 25% of the appraised value.

11:12.612 --> 11:13.945
Why?

11:13.947 --> 11:16.948
In appreciation for
all my hard work.

11:16.950 --> 11:19.083
I took it on memo so
Evan and I could think about it.

11:19.085 --> 11:22.036
What is there to think about?

11:22.038 --> 11:25.840
You've talked about
this piece all week.

11:25.842 --> 11:30.345
I don't know.

11:30.347 --> 11:31.796
If you don't buy it, I will.

11:31.798 --> 11:34.432
It's a steal.

11:34.434 --> 11:35.750
Okay.

11:35.752 --> 11:36.968
As soon as my phone
is done charging,

11:36.970 --> 11:38.419
I'm gonna call Evan.

11:38.421 --> 11:40.755
Oh, sweetie, it doesn't charge
if you don't plug it in.

11:40.757 --> 11:45.310
It is charging,
on the wireless charging pad.

11:45.312 --> 11:47.228
I like it.

11:47.230 --> 11:48.863
Cords are so clumsy.

11:48.865 --> 11:52.400
Your first call needs
to be to the Hollands,

11:52.402 --> 11:53.868
before they change their minds.

11:53.870 --> 11:55.536
You're right.

11:55.538 --> 11:59.957
I love it, and I'm buying it.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.501
I had no idea spinning
was so intense.

12:10.503 --> 12:13.421
Yeah, most of these guys
are high-powered

12:13.423 --> 12:14.889
something or others who don't lose.

12:14.891 --> 12:16.724
Everything they do
is to the extreme.

12:16.726 --> 12:17.975
I know because I used
to be one of them.

12:17.977 --> 12:19.460
Oh, really?

12:19.462 --> 12:21.012
I didn't take you
for a corporate refugee.

12:21.014 --> 12:23.815
I got sucked into wall street
after college

12:23.817 --> 12:26.684
by the prospect
of making a really good living.

12:26.686 --> 12:29.404
But this, this is
really good living.

12:29.406 --> 12:30.638
Yes, it is.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.990
Sounds like you made
the right decision.

12:32.992 --> 12:34.859
I'm sure you get this
all the time, as a doctor,

12:34.861 --> 12:36.911
but I was wondering, can I
ask you a medical question?

12:36.913 --> 12:38.279
Yeah, sure. What's going on?

12:38.281 --> 12:39.697
I've been having some
jaw pain lately.

12:39.699 --> 12:40.998
Okay. How long?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.867
A few weeks.

12:42.869 --> 12:44.035
Do you think it could be T.M.J.?

12:44.037 --> 12:47.588
Could be. Let me take a look.

12:47.590 --> 12:49.040
Uh, open.

12:49.042 --> 12:51.175
Close. Open.

12:51.177 --> 12:52.377
Pain on both sides?

12:52.379 --> 12:53.544
No, just the right.

12:53.546 --> 12:54.879
Okay, I got a few minutes.

12:54.881 --> 12:56.431
I can do a diagnostic nerve block.

12:56.433 --> 12:57.832
It's a quick test to determine

12:57.834 --> 12:59.767
if the pain is from T.M.J.
or another cause.

12:59.769 --> 13:00.935
Yeah, I'm game.

13:00.937 --> 13:02.353
Okay, great.

13:02.355 --> 13:03.855
Let's do it over here.

13:10.312 --> 13:12.447
I'm going to inject Lidocaine
into the skin

13:12.449 --> 13:13.698
below the jaw line.

13:18.520 --> 13:22.373
If the pain is relieved
instantly, it suggests T.M.J.

13:26.128 --> 13:28.529
Okay.

13:28.531 --> 13:29.964
Still hurt?

13:29.966 --> 13:31.165
Yeah.

13:31.167 --> 13:32.533
Huh.

13:32.535 --> 13:35.035
It may be an impacted
wisdom tooth or cavity.

13:35.037 --> 13:36.220
Do you have a dentist?

13:36.222 --> 13:39.424
- I have three in my next class.
- Oh.

13:45.764 --> 13:47.482
I really appreciate this, Hank.

13:47.484 --> 13:49.717
I was going to put them
in Jeremiah's garage,

13:49.719 --> 13:50.985
but I can't.

13:50.987 --> 13:52.270
Too full?

13:52.272 --> 13:53.654
Too flawless.

13:53.656 --> 13:55.189
He prefers that you
take your shoes off

13:55.191 --> 13:56.491
before walking into it.

13:57.777 --> 14:01.829
- Please, let me help.
- No.

14:01.831 --> 14:04.332
My landlord swears that
my place is going to be ready

14:04.334 --> 14:07.835
in three weeks.

14:07.837 --> 14:09.570
Divya, I told you, let me do this.

14:09.572 --> 14:10.838
They're too heavy for you.

14:10.840 --> 14:13.090
I feel like I should help.
It's my stuff.

14:13.092 --> 14:16.127
You can help by letting me do it.

14:16.129 --> 14:18.963
Oh, did I tell you
that I figured out a way

14:18.965 --> 14:22.183
to turn my walk-in closet
into a nursery?

14:22.185 --> 14:23.968
And since my landlord
has to take the place

14:23.970 --> 14:25.353
down to the studs,

14:25.355 --> 14:26.471
he's agreed to put
a window into it.

14:26.473 --> 14:28.105
- That's great.
- Yeah.

14:28.107 --> 14:31.142
And he's repainting anyway,
so I can pick the colors.

14:31.144 --> 14:33.528
I didn't want to go with
the traditional blues or pinks,

14:33.530 --> 14:36.731
so I am trying to decide between

14:36.733 --> 14:42.653
baby turtle, Cancun sand,
or Dorian Gray.

14:42.655 --> 14:45.039
Dorian Gray.
That paint never gets old.

14:45.041 --> 14:46.991
All right.

14:46.993 --> 14:48.743
You know, I thought
that this mold thing

14:48.745 --> 14:50.444
was going to be terrible,

14:50.446 --> 14:53.915
but it turns out I'm getting
a whole remodel out of it.

14:53.917 --> 14:56.384
I guess you could say
you've found the fungal lining.

14:58.004 --> 15:00.505
Wasn't that funny, was it?
All right.

15:06.678 --> 15:09.514
Our first piece of serious art.

15:09.516 --> 15:13.768
Isn't it beautiful?

15:13.770 --> 15:18.940
It's... a nice... box.

15:18.942 --> 15:20.908
You know, sometimes you have
to live with a piece

15:20.910 --> 15:22.109
before you love it.

15:22.111 --> 15:26.247
But trust me,
this is a beautiful sculpture,

15:26.249 --> 15:27.648
and a great investment.

15:27.650 --> 15:29.166
An investment?

15:29.168 --> 15:34.321
Oh, God, how much did we invest?

15:34.323 --> 15:36.207
What?

15:36.209 --> 15:38.125
We paid this for that?

15:38.127 --> 15:42.597
<i>The Red Square</i> is worth
three times what I paid.

15:42.599 --> 15:44.515
Our nest egg might
have a little crack in it,

15:44.517 --> 15:46.851
but trust me, this is worth it.

15:46.853 --> 15:49.103
Our nest egg is for emergencies.

15:49.105 --> 15:52.339
Or, I don't know,
maybe one day our own house.

15:52.341 --> 15:54.392
Unless we can live in
<i>The Red Square.</i>

15:54.394 --> 15:56.193
I didn't spend it all.

15:56.195 --> 15:58.896
And, Evan, this is a major work.

15:58.898 --> 16:01.782
Paige, this is a major purchase.

16:01.784 --> 16:04.402
Major purchases
need to be discussed, okay?

16:04.404 --> 16:06.871
- That's what married people do.
- Really?

16:06.873 --> 16:09.957
Like we did when you leased that
expensive car for the summer?

16:09.959 --> 16:11.242
That was a professional investment.

16:11.244 --> 16:12.543
Perception's everything,
with what I do.

16:12.545 --> 16:14.378
This is... this is crazy.

16:14.380 --> 16:17.698
This is beautiful.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.634
But if I have to
explain to you why...

16:19.636 --> 16:22.420
You know what, okay,
I do need you to explain it,

16:22.422 --> 16:24.589
because I'm looking at it,
and I'm thinking,

16:24.591 --> 16:26.090
a kindergartner could
trip on some paint

16:26.092 --> 16:27.725
and make better art than this.

16:27.727 --> 16:30.011
I would buy you a copy
of <i>Art For Dummies,</i>

16:30.013 --> 16:31.762
but I don't think
you'd understand it.

16:31.764 --> 16:33.230
What's to understand?

16:33.232 --> 16:35.066
It's a red box.

16:35.068 --> 16:37.234
What I don't understand
is how you could think

16:37.236 --> 16:39.720
I would want to look at this
for the next 50 years.

16:39.722 --> 16:41.272
It sounds to me
like what you're saying is

16:41.274 --> 16:43.524
that you don't trust that I know
what I'm doing at my job.

16:43.526 --> 16:46.110
You mean the unpaid internship
you've had for a few weeks?

16:46.112 --> 16:49.614
Ohh!

16:55.532 --> 16:57.421
- It's unacceptable.
- It's boiler plate.

16:57.445 --> 16:59.495
Hankmed will not move forward
if the time off policy

16:59.497 --> 17:02.531
isn't described in detail in
the fringe benefits paragraph.

17:02.533 --> 17:03.866
I'm trying not to get alarmed,

17:03.868 --> 17:06.001
but what should I read
into your knee-jerk objection

17:06.002 --> 17:07.903
to every single
indemnity provision?

17:07.905 --> 17:10.423
We have a fiduciary duty
to our board of directors...

17:10.425 --> 17:12.425
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Time off policy?

17:12.426 --> 17:13.843
Your lawyer wants me to write in

17:13.845 --> 17:15.795
a certain number of
paid vacation days.

17:15.797 --> 17:17.346
Trust me, you're going
to want it in writing.

17:17.348 --> 17:19.414
Keller, I don't really
take my vacations as it is,

17:19.415 --> 17:21.183
so I think we can
agree and move on.

17:21.185 --> 17:24.553
We're on page 4 of 54,
and I have patients to see.

17:24.555 --> 17:25.721
Maybe we should
tackle earn outs tomorrow.

17:25.723 --> 17:27.890
- Maybe.
- Sorry, I'm booked.

17:27.892 --> 17:30.025
Well, cancel your spin class.

17:30.027 --> 17:33.145
Spin class?

17:33.147 --> 17:35.981
We need to speak privately.

17:35.983 --> 17:37.116
Uh, okay?

17:37.118 --> 17:39.201
Oh, wow.

17:39.203 --> 17:41.603
Listen to me. Stop undermining us.

17:41.605 --> 17:43.072
She can smell your impatience.

17:45.910 --> 17:47.376
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

17:47.378 --> 17:49.495
This is why I hate
negotiating with women.

17:49.497 --> 17:50.779
Look at this.

17:50.781 --> 17:52.614
Shelby? Shelby,
would you like a break?

17:52.616 --> 17:54.116
Oh, no need.

17:54.118 --> 17:56.085
I'm used to pushing
forward on bad days.

17:56.087 --> 17:57.503
"Bad days"?

17:57.505 --> 17:58.637
Wait, what does she
mean by "bad days"?

17:58.639 --> 17:59.972
Is she sick?

17:59.974 --> 18:04.059
Tell me. Maybe we can use it.

18:04.061 --> 18:06.312
Okay, I'll tell you what, Shelby.

18:06.314 --> 18:08.347
You can have a permanent break.

18:08.349 --> 18:09.464
If you don't erase
these conflicting terms,

18:09.466 --> 18:10.516
we are walking.

18:10.518 --> 18:11.817
Go ahead.

18:16.656 --> 18:20.159
Come on.

18:22.280 --> 18:24.497
- Are you...
- I'm fine.

18:24.499 --> 18:29.084
We're walking. Walk.

18:29.086 --> 18:31.504
I guess we're walking.

18:31.506 --> 18:33.506
- Bye, Shelby.
- Bye.

18:33.508 --> 18:35.490
Ken!

18:38.328 --> 18:40.179
I've decided not to keep it.

18:40.181 --> 18:41.213
So your husband vetoed it.

18:41.215 --> 18:43.465
- Mr. Berger?
- Yes, Matthew?

18:43.467 --> 18:45.467
Would you like
the dining table and chairs

18:45.469 --> 18:47.669
to be listed as a single lot?

18:47.671 --> 18:50.055
This conversation sounds familiar,

18:50.057 --> 18:51.941
and not in a nostalgic way.

18:51.943 --> 18:55.060
We spoke about
the downstairs chippendale.

18:55.062 --> 18:58.147
I'm referring to
the upstairs Italian empire.

18:58.149 --> 19:00.316
Single lot.

19:00.318 --> 19:02.368
I have to sell it.

19:02.370 --> 19:04.904
You are obviously a neophyte

19:04.906 --> 19:06.956
to the world of domestic squabbles.

19:06.958 --> 19:09.909
This was our first real fight
as a married couple.

19:09.911 --> 19:12.161
Well, if you and your
hubby traded barbs

19:12.163 --> 19:14.663
about the square in the room,

19:14.665 --> 19:19.051
wait till it's out of the room.

19:19.053 --> 19:23.589
Do you still want to buy it?

19:23.591 --> 19:28.477
I'm sure I can find a buyer.

19:28.479 --> 19:30.479
And I'll take my
commission, of course.

19:40.992 --> 19:42.274
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:42.276 --> 19:44.026
J.T. or Jay-Z?

19:44.028 --> 19:47.079
Uh, Run-D.M.C.

19:47.081 --> 19:48.080
Yeah? All right.

19:48.082 --> 19:49.365
Run-D.M.C.

19:49.367 --> 19:50.866
So I got a call from your dentist.

19:50.868 --> 19:52.918
Yeah, yeah.
He didn't find anything.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.870
Which is a relief,
because on the bike,

19:54.872 --> 19:56.205
I'm no pain, no gain,

19:56.207 --> 19:59.091
but kind of wimpy
in the dentist's chair.

19:59.093 --> 20:00.593
But the jaw pain is worse.

20:00.595 --> 20:01.910
Huh.

20:01.912 --> 20:04.013
Have you had any
injuries to the area?

20:04.015 --> 20:05.714
No.

20:05.716 --> 20:08.934
Well, there was an
angry ex-girlfriend.

20:08.936 --> 20:10.219
Not that area.

20:10.221 --> 20:11.687
Jaws are hard to break,

20:11.689 --> 20:12.754
but all it takes
is hitting it just right,

20:12.756 --> 20:14.023
and you can get a
hairline fracture.

20:14.025 --> 20:15.424
Like I said, I'm a wimp.

20:15.426 --> 20:16.859
I would remember an injury.

20:16.861 --> 20:18.260
Right.

20:18.262 --> 20:19.612
Well, this would be unusual,

20:19.614 --> 20:22.031
but arthritis can start in the jaw,

20:22.033 --> 20:23.532
so I'd like to draw
some blood to test

20:23.534 --> 20:25.451
your erythrocyte
sedimentation rate.

20:25.453 --> 20:27.536
The sed rate reveals
the inflammatory activity

20:27.538 --> 20:29.288
in your body.

20:29.290 --> 20:31.707
I'm gonna choose not to focus
on the word "arthritis."

20:31.709 --> 20:33.208
- I think that's wise.
- Okay.

20:33.210 --> 20:37.663
I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna
set up right over there.

20:37.665 --> 20:39.748
Hey, when am I gonna
see you on a bike?

20:39.750 --> 20:41.717
I will be in your class tomorrow.

20:41.719 --> 20:43.385
I hope I can keep up,

20:43.387 --> 20:46.088
or "killer" Keller will never
let me hear the end of it.

20:46.090 --> 20:48.007
That guy is an animal in here.

20:48.009 --> 20:49.258
It's cutthroat.

20:49.260 --> 20:50.259
It's worse than wall street.

20:50.261 --> 20:52.177
Oh, great. Sounds like a blast.

20:52.179 --> 20:53.178
Come on down.

21:00.803 --> 21:02.571
Uh, have you been
teaching a lot today?

21:02.573 --> 21:06.692
No, my first class
of the day starts shortly.

21:06.694 --> 21:08.477
Yesterday I thought you were
having difficulty walking

21:08.479 --> 21:10.946
'cause you had on
your cycling shoes.

21:10.948 --> 21:13.332
Have you experienced
any tingling or numbness

21:13.334 --> 21:14.816
in your legs or feet?

21:14.818 --> 21:16.118
Uh, yeah, my feet have
been a little numb,

21:16.120 --> 21:18.203
but they get that way
when my shoes are on too tight.

21:18.205 --> 21:21.623
Right. Are they numb now?

21:21.625 --> 21:23.509
Uh, yeah. I guess they are.

21:23.511 --> 21:24.510
Okay.

21:24.512 --> 21:25.878
I want to check your reflexes.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.714
Have a seat up here.

21:32.936 --> 21:34.002
Good.

21:36.890 --> 21:39.224
Well, your response is normal.

21:39.226 --> 21:40.526
I want to do a C.T.

21:40.528 --> 21:42.311
Why?

21:42.313 --> 21:44.029
It's just a diagnostic tool.

21:44.031 --> 21:45.847
I mean, facial
migraines can produce

21:45.849 --> 21:47.032
a deep, dull pain in the jaw.

21:47.034 --> 21:48.617
This may be nothing more than that,

21:48.619 --> 21:51.537
but I'd like to rule out
other possibilities as well.

21:54.624 --> 21:56.709
All right.

22:00.464 --> 22:01.830
Greer?

22:01.832 --> 22:03.966
Oh.

22:03.968 --> 22:07.002
Hey, I... I called to see
how you were doing.

22:07.004 --> 22:08.537
I probably couldn't
hear the phone ring

22:08.539 --> 22:10.305
over the blare
of the smoke alarm going off.

22:10.307 --> 22:11.974
What happened?

22:11.976 --> 22:14.343
I accidentally left a spatula
on a cookie sheet,

22:14.345 --> 22:17.146
and now there's plastic melted
all over my ruined oven.

22:17.148 --> 22:18.814
That explains the smell.

22:18.816 --> 22:20.516
Yeah, and I still owe
over 100 dozen caramels,

22:20.518 --> 22:21.683
and I haven't even started

22:21.685 --> 22:22.851
on my Belgian chocolate pretzels.

22:22.853 --> 22:24.553
What happened to
your new assistant?

22:24.555 --> 22:26.688
I had so much to do,
I had to give her the day off.

22:26.690 --> 22:27.889
And I know that that sounds nuts,

22:27.891 --> 22:29.241
but she asks so many questions,

22:29.243 --> 22:30.242
and she wants to write
everything down,

22:30.244 --> 22:31.660
and it's really inefficient.

22:31.662 --> 22:33.728
Okay, what actually troubles me

22:33.730 --> 22:36.081
is the sound of your chest.

22:36.083 --> 22:38.417
Okay.

22:38.419 --> 22:40.202
- Okay, let's step outside.
- I can't.

22:40.204 --> 22:41.703
I really need to be in the kitchen.

22:41.705 --> 22:44.006
- I have...
- Okay.

22:44.008 --> 22:47.259
Look at me. Inhale.

22:47.261 --> 22:51.430
And hold as long as you can.

22:51.432 --> 22:54.049
Better?

22:54.051 --> 22:55.750
You're wheezing,
and you're short of breath.

22:55.752 --> 22:57.269
Have you ever suffered from asthma?

22:57.271 --> 22:58.854
Mmmm.

22:58.856 --> 23:01.356
I want to schedule a chest X-ray
and pulmonary function test.

23:01.358 --> 23:02.858
What about my deadline?

23:02.860 --> 23:04.943
I've got a delivery truck
coming tonight,

23:04.945 --> 23:08.030
and no oven.

23:08.032 --> 23:09.448
I need to get permission,

23:09.450 --> 23:12.317
but I may know of a kitchen
that you can use.

23:12.319 --> 23:14.119
Um... okay.

23:14.121 --> 23:16.622
No problem.

23:16.624 --> 23:19.458
Yes, I'm sure.

23:19.460 --> 23:21.577
You're welcome.

23:24.464 --> 23:28.283
Oh, why couldn't I just say no?

23:28.285 --> 23:30.803
Were you talking to Divya?

23:30.805 --> 23:32.221
There's your answer.

23:32.223 --> 23:35.007
Good news, Ben.
Your C.T. was clean.

23:35.009 --> 23:36.625
Not such good news for me,

23:36.627 --> 23:38.894
'cause I probably won't get out
of taking your class tomorrow.

23:38.896 --> 23:41.263
Do I have to wear bike shorts?

23:41.265 --> 23:43.765
Okay, good.

23:43.767 --> 23:46.351
I've been a little concerned

23:46.353 --> 23:48.237
ever since I found out
Divya was moving in with you,

23:48.239 --> 23:51.073
knowing how you feel,

23:51.075 --> 23:55.310
'cause sharing space
with anybody can be tricky,

23:55.312 --> 23:58.313
even if it's someone
you know really well.

23:58.315 --> 24:01.366
Even with me and Paige,
I mean, sure,

24:01.368 --> 24:04.703
we've definitely had some...

24:04.705 --> 24:07.372
I wouldn't say problems,
but hiccups,

24:07.374 --> 24:10.459
adjustments to living together.

24:10.461 --> 24:14.046
Nothing major, just...

24:14.048 --> 24:17.432
Women can be very
touchy about stuff.

24:17.434 --> 24:22.688
She bought a plant
and a blanket kind of thing.

24:22.690 --> 24:23.939
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

24:23.941 --> 24:25.023
They see something, they want it,

24:25.025 --> 24:26.341
they have to have it,

24:26.343 --> 24:28.060
even if it's utterly ridiculous,

24:28.062 --> 24:31.179
even if it's nonsensical
and ugly as sin.

24:31.181 --> 24:34.816
Well, I wouldn't call it ugly.
It's just a little bright.

24:34.818 --> 24:35.984
You know what, though?

24:35.986 --> 24:38.287
Once you talk it over,
you get through it.

24:38.289 --> 24:41.707
And I think she'll understand
where I was coming from,

24:41.709 --> 24:43.542
and we'll be stronger for it,
in the end.

24:43.544 --> 24:47.713
Well, she promised
she'll clean it all up.

24:50.199 --> 24:52.885
All what up?

24:59.342 --> 25:01.643
This kitchen is
bigger than my house.

25:01.645 --> 25:02.928
I can't believe you
get to cook in here.

25:02.930 --> 25:05.814
I'm afraid to. It's so perfect.

25:05.816 --> 25:08.317
Hey, am I putting too much on?

25:08.319 --> 25:11.820
Nope. That is perfect.

25:11.822 --> 25:12.821
I don't know why you're worried

25:12.823 --> 25:14.156
about having employees.

25:14.158 --> 25:16.992
I mean, you're a wonderful boss.

25:16.994 --> 25:19.060
My reputation, though,
it's, you know,

25:19.062 --> 25:20.746
built on consistency.

25:20.748 --> 25:22.197
My customers know when they bite

25:22.199 --> 25:23.865
into one of my chocolate turtles,

25:23.867 --> 25:25.951
they're gonna get a rich
and velvety chocolate turtle

25:25.953 --> 25:27.402
every time.

25:27.404 --> 25:29.004
Your new staff is going
to know your recipes

25:29.006 --> 25:30.706
before you know it.

25:30.708 --> 25:33.041
It just takes time to develop
a team that you trust.

25:33.043 --> 25:35.344
I guess I'll find out
if my instincts apply

25:35.346 --> 25:38.880
to people or just to candy.

25:38.882 --> 25:41.133
Okay, now that's too much.

25:41.135 --> 25:43.185
See? Was that hard?

25:43.187 --> 25:45.103
No.

25:45.105 --> 25:47.222
I loved it.

25:47.224 --> 25:48.440
So if I love bossing you around,

25:48.442 --> 25:49.858
why am I so anxious?

25:49.860 --> 25:50.976
Well, maybe you're apprehensive

25:50.978 --> 25:52.227
about sharing your space.

25:52.229 --> 25:55.030
My kitchen? Huh.

25:55.032 --> 25:56.782
I love it, but I'm not
that particular about my space.

25:56.784 --> 25:58.116
Are you?

25:58.118 --> 26:01.620
I've never really thought
about it before now,

26:01.622 --> 26:03.205
but I suppose I am.

26:03.207 --> 26:08.276
I mean, having someplace where
you feel at home is important.

26:08.278 --> 26:10.662
Mm. That is perfect.

26:10.664 --> 26:11.913
Really good batch.

26:11.915 --> 26:17.052
I haven't sampled them yet.

26:17.054 --> 26:18.670
Oh, wow.

26:18.672 --> 26:21.289
This is like the perfect
confectionary storm.

26:24.677 --> 26:27.295
Come here. I see you're choking.

26:27.297 --> 26:29.348
Stay calm and relax your body.

26:32.685 --> 26:35.604
Strop struggling.

26:35.606 --> 26:36.150
Come on.

26:44.364 --> 26:46.365
You okay?

26:53.142 --> 26:55.137
The barium swallow revealed
that you have

26:55.169 --> 26:56.418
esophageal strictures,

26:56.420 --> 26:58.003
which is the narrowing
of the esophagus

26:58.005 --> 26:59.972
that causes difficulty
in swallowing,

26:59.974 --> 27:02.224
and in your case,
caused you to choke.

27:02.226 --> 27:03.675
How did I get it?

27:03.677 --> 27:04.926
All the stress that
you've been under

27:04.928 --> 27:07.562
has taken a toll and
caused acid reflux.

27:07.564 --> 27:09.815
Is there a way to treat it?

27:09.817 --> 27:11.383
You need an outpatient procedure

27:11.385 --> 27:13.902
known as balloon dilation
to break down the scar tissue.

27:13.904 --> 27:16.104
It's done very quickly
by endoscopy.

27:16.106 --> 27:17.272
Okay, great.

27:17.274 --> 27:18.607
I will schedule that...

27:18.609 --> 27:19.941
Call Wendy.

27:19.943 --> 27:21.493
She can wrap up the
orders for delivery,

27:21.495 --> 27:22.527
and I'll take you now to meet

27:22.529 --> 27:24.079
with an interventional radiologist.

27:24.081 --> 27:26.331
But it won't take long. It's...

27:26.333 --> 27:30.285
Your business requires you
to constantly sample your candy.

27:30.287 --> 27:32.954
The risk of you choking again
is too great.

27:32.956 --> 27:34.623
What if, the next
time, you're alone?

27:34.625 --> 27:36.091
But I haven't shown her how I...

27:36.093 --> 27:38.293
delegate.

27:38.295 --> 27:44.299
Greer, you have to start
being the boss sometime.

27:44.301 --> 27:48.804
You're right.

27:48.806 --> 27:50.439
You're right.

27:54.644 --> 27:57.762
Hey.

27:57.764 --> 28:01.266
I got your favorite...

28:04.737 --> 28:05.904
strawberry mint chip.

28:05.906 --> 28:08.540
It's your favorite.

28:12.161 --> 28:13.879
Oh. Sorry.

28:13.881 --> 28:15.213
No need to apologize.

28:15.215 --> 28:17.466
It's just a table.

28:17.468 --> 28:18.500
An empty table.

28:21.220 --> 28:24.639
Well, I, uh, I bought
the extra large container...

28:24.641 --> 28:28.593
You bought it without
consulting me?

28:28.595 --> 28:32.230
I'm on a deadline, Evan.

28:32.232 --> 28:37.135
Right. But, uh, when you're done...

29:06.632 --> 29:10.385
Jeremiah.

29:10.387 --> 29:13.638
I am so sorry. Don't worry.

29:13.640 --> 29:16.057
I'm going to clean
this entire kitchen

29:16.059 --> 29:17.359
from top to bottom.

29:17.361 --> 29:20.061
It is going to look
exactly as you left it,

29:20.063 --> 29:21.062
even better.

29:21.064 --> 29:23.064
I promise.

29:31.457 --> 29:35.193
Do you prefer this photo
of the Biedermeier,

29:35.195 --> 29:36.461
or this photo?

29:36.463 --> 29:38.296
Um, this one.

29:38.298 --> 29:40.549
It highlights the markings
on the secretary desk.

29:40.551 --> 29:42.584
The light is better.

29:42.586 --> 29:46.138
You were right about
The Red Square.

29:46.140 --> 29:49.141
Getting rid of it
has only made things worse.

29:49.143 --> 29:50.509
You want it back.

29:50.511 --> 29:51.893
I never should have let it go.

29:51.895 --> 29:54.479
Now all I feel
is resentment towards Evan.

29:54.481 --> 29:58.066
You know, I thought
he would get it.

29:58.068 --> 30:01.269
But he doesn't need
to understand why I love it.

30:01.271 --> 30:06.358
He just needs to respect
that it's important to me.

30:06.360 --> 30:07.943
I have to have it.

30:07.945 --> 30:11.696
And Evan and I, we'll just have
to work through it.

30:11.698 --> 30:13.782
Oh, dear.

30:13.784 --> 30:15.116
What?

30:15.118 --> 30:16.835
I already sold it.

30:23.709 --> 30:24.709
Divya?

30:24.711 --> 30:26.211
I'm sleeping.

30:26.213 --> 30:28.913
Okay. Sorry.

30:28.915 --> 30:31.349
Wait.

30:31.351 --> 30:36.438
I need to talk.

30:36.440 --> 30:38.056
I'm listening.

30:38.058 --> 30:41.759
I think I made a mistake.

30:41.761 --> 30:43.478
A really big mistake.

30:43.480 --> 30:44.896
Is this about Greer?

30:44.898 --> 30:46.648
No. No.

30:46.650 --> 30:50.268
Greer is fine,
though she was an accomplice.

30:50.270 --> 30:51.987
It's about me and Jeremiah.

30:51.989 --> 30:54.155
Hmm.

30:54.157 --> 30:55.373
Roommate issues?

30:55.375 --> 30:58.043
To say the least.

30:58.045 --> 31:02.163
I've never thought of myself
as inconsiderate,

31:02.165 --> 31:04.833
but at Jeremiah's house,
I'm a nightmare of a guest.

31:04.835 --> 31:06.635
Oh, please. I doubt that.

31:06.637 --> 31:09.387
I let Greer use his kitchen,

31:09.389 --> 31:12.173
and let's just say we
made a mess of it.

31:14.177 --> 31:18.513
Honestly, out of all
the kitchens in all the world.

31:20.267 --> 31:23.401
I shouldn't find it funny,
but it was such a disaster.

31:23.403 --> 31:25.437
- Did Jeremiah laugh?
- No.

31:25.439 --> 31:29.024
Oh. Okay.

31:29.026 --> 31:30.775
Not even a little.

31:30.777 --> 31:32.694
Sounds like
you're having second thoughts

31:32.696 --> 31:33.745
about staying there.

31:33.747 --> 31:34.247
I am.

31:38.168 --> 31:41.953
Well, you're welcome to stay here,

31:41.955 --> 31:44.089
once I move all your boxes again.

31:44.091 --> 31:46.508
No. Can't do that.

31:46.510 --> 31:47.842
Hey, you already have.

31:47.844 --> 31:49.928
I mean, you are crashed
on my lounger.

31:49.930 --> 31:52.264
I am, aren't I?

31:52.266 --> 31:54.683
Yes, you are.

31:54.685 --> 31:59.604
No.

31:59.606 --> 32:02.774
If I've learned anything from this,

32:02.776 --> 32:06.278
it's that I do better living alone.

32:06.280 --> 32:07.679
It's more my style.

32:07.681 --> 32:09.564
Well, you can't for much longer.

32:09.566 --> 32:12.734
I mean, pretty soon, you'll
have someone sharing your space.

32:12.736 --> 32:15.620
And they'll be sharing it
for, like, the next 18 years,

32:15.622 --> 32:19.541
possibly more.

32:19.543 --> 32:21.042
Is that what's been bothering you?

32:24.297 --> 32:26.498
Divya?

32:26.500 --> 32:29.634
Okay, well, at least
it's not keeping you up.

32:33.806 --> 32:35.974
Good talk, Div.

33:05.706 --> 33:07.622
All right, everybody,
feel that sunshine.

33:07.624 --> 33:09.791
Way better than a corner office.

33:09.793 --> 33:11.042
I'm feeling it.

33:11.044 --> 33:12.377
I'm gonna turn up my resistance
a little bit.

33:12.379 --> 33:14.379
Yeah, so am I.

33:14.381 --> 33:15.630
All right, we all warmed up?

33:15.632 --> 33:16.748
Yeah.

33:16.750 --> 33:18.466
Oh, all right, then. Let's race.

33:18.468 --> 33:21.102
Really, Shackleford?
What are you doing here?

33:21.104 --> 33:22.804
What, I'm sensitive
to your client's needs,

33:22.806 --> 33:24.139
and he wants to close this deal.

33:24.141 --> 33:25.140
You're not sensitive to my client.

33:25.142 --> 33:26.858
You're stalking him.

33:26.860 --> 33:28.777
Your shoes match your outfit.

33:28.779 --> 33:31.479
I didn't know they
made spanx for men.

33:31.481 --> 33:32.564
You know, they make spanx
for women, too.

33:32.566 --> 33:33.565
I do.

33:33.567 --> 33:34.766
Those would probably
fit you better.

33:34.768 --> 33:35.784
Okay, stop it. Stop it now.

33:35.786 --> 33:37.986
You're both children.
Off your bikes.

33:37.988 --> 33:39.988
Off. Off.

33:39.990 --> 33:41.072
Get a room, and don't come out

33:41.074 --> 33:42.157
until the deal's been finalized.

33:44.961 --> 33:45.960
Go.

33:45.962 --> 33:47.996
- Fine.
- Fine.

33:51.418 --> 33:53.334
- You're welcome.
- All right, everybody.

33:53.336 --> 33:55.420
Time to get that upper body
sexy and strong.

33:55.422 --> 33:57.389
We're gonna do push-ups,
sets of eight.

33:57.391 --> 33:58.390
Here we go.

33:58.392 --> 34:02.310
One, two...

34:06.232 --> 34:07.482
What happened?

34:07.484 --> 34:08.933
It feels like my brain
is being shocked.

34:08.935 --> 34:12.437
Does it hurt at the
base of your skull?

34:12.438 --> 34:14.022
Mm-hmm.

34:14.024 --> 34:15.356
I think the pain you feel is 'cause

34:15.358 --> 34:16.608
you have an arterial
tear in your neck.

34:16.610 --> 34:19.077
We need to get you to the E.R. now.

34:19.079 --> 34:22.414
911 emergency.

34:28.420 --> 34:30.422
The M.R.I. confirmed a separation

34:30.424 --> 34:32.224
of the layers in the arterial wall.

34:32.226 --> 34:34.092
- That sounds serious.
- It can be.

34:34.094 --> 34:35.393
But we're lucky we discovered it

34:35.396 --> 34:37.763
before it led to a blood clot
and caused a stroke.

34:37.764 --> 34:39.848
Why did it tear?

34:39.850 --> 34:41.600
Typically,
vertebral dissections can occur

34:41.601 --> 34:44.069
from traumatic injury,
like whiplash,

34:44.071 --> 34:46.405
but even vigorous exercise
can damage the artery.

34:46.407 --> 34:50.208
So the healthiest
thing I do gave me

34:50.210 --> 34:52.277
the most serious medical problem
I've ever had?

34:52.279 --> 34:54.362
I noticed you get
really into the music

34:54.364 --> 34:55.697
during your spin class.

34:55.699 --> 34:57.416
That constant bobbing
motion of the head

34:57.418 --> 34:58.784
may have caused it.

35:01.088 --> 35:02.371
But I can teach again?

35:02.373 --> 35:03.989
With drug therapy,
you should be back

35:03.991 --> 35:05.590
to spinning before you know it.

35:05.592 --> 35:10.095
But maybe leave the headbanging
to the hair metal bands.

35:10.097 --> 35:13.682
This looks like the right color.

35:13.684 --> 35:16.134
It is.

35:16.136 --> 35:17.602
I read the radiologist's report.

35:17.604 --> 35:19.304
Your dilation was successful.

35:19.306 --> 35:20.672
How is your throat feeling?

35:20.674 --> 35:23.775
Fine. Not even sore.

35:23.777 --> 35:26.344
Pickup's in an hour.

35:26.346 --> 35:28.780
I would like to do
a spirometry test

35:28.782 --> 35:29.781
to measure your airflow.

35:29.783 --> 35:30.782
It won't take long.

35:33.453 --> 35:35.287
Here.

35:35.289 --> 35:37.990
Now take a deep, deep breath,

35:37.992 --> 35:39.074
and breathe out as hard as you can.

35:39.076 --> 35:40.075
Okay.

35:40.077 --> 35:43.829
Ready?

35:43.831 --> 35:46.465
Keep going, keep going, keep
going, keep going, keep going,

35:46.467 --> 35:48.333
go, go, go.

35:48.335 --> 35:50.469
Perfect. Great.

35:50.471 --> 35:53.638
It looks like your breathing
is returning to normal.

35:53.640 --> 35:56.374
Courtesy of Wendy
and my two new confectioners.

35:56.376 --> 35:58.343
I called and they came
and fixed the oven,

35:58.345 --> 35:59.544
started working their magic.

35:59.546 --> 36:01.596
They really picked up the slack.

36:01.598 --> 36:03.315
That's wonderful.

36:03.317 --> 36:05.767
But to prevent the stricture
from forming again,

36:05.769 --> 36:08.153
we need to deal with the
underlying cause, your stress.

36:08.155 --> 36:10.822
Well, now that I'm not trying
to do everything myself,

36:10.824 --> 36:12.657
I'm actually okay with being bossy.

36:12.659 --> 36:14.860
Here. Taste this.

36:14.862 --> 36:18.447
Oh.

36:18.449 --> 36:20.398
It's too sweet.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.950
Believe it or not,
the secret to sweetness

36:21.952 --> 36:22.951
is actually salt.

36:22.953 --> 36:26.171
Here, I'll show you.

36:41.971 --> 36:43.972
I got a good deal, too.

36:43.974 --> 36:45.757
The guy waived his commission.

36:50.863 --> 36:53.982
I cleaned everything
as best as I could.

36:53.984 --> 36:57.319
I hope I got everything.

36:57.321 --> 36:58.726
You missed two things.

37:08.581 --> 37:10.048
You didn't have to do that.

37:17.674 --> 37:21.476
I don't even know
why I brought them.

37:21.478 --> 37:22.511
I was being pushy.

37:22.513 --> 37:24.479
No, you... you were nesting.

37:24.481 --> 37:25.897
That's what pregnant women do,

37:25.899 --> 37:28.650
according to my research.

37:28.652 --> 37:30.602
You're also experiencing
an increase

37:30.604 --> 37:36.441
in progesterone and
estrogen levels.

37:36.443 --> 37:39.528
I think you're right.

37:46.919 --> 37:51.990
I've had nesting on my brain.

37:51.992 --> 37:54.709
But this is your home,

37:54.711 --> 37:57.045
and I'm intruding.

37:57.047 --> 37:59.347
You can stay here
as long as you need to.

37:59.349 --> 38:02.017
As long as you want to.

38:02.019 --> 38:05.804
I know how particular you are
about your space.

38:05.806 --> 38:08.473
I want to work on that.

38:08.475 --> 38:11.176
Are you sure?

38:13.696 --> 38:17.032
Well, I'll be a better guest.

38:28.744 --> 38:30.412
Hank.

38:30.414 --> 38:31.913
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:31.915 --> 38:33.165
The hospital told me you were here.

38:33.167 --> 38:35.500
- Mm-hmm.
- That's a nice room.

38:35.502 --> 38:37.169
Yeah, I've been here so long
they let me redecorate.

38:38.388 --> 38:40.371
So I hear we finally have a deal.

38:40.373 --> 38:41.506
Yeah, now all we need
is an actual contract.

38:41.508 --> 38:43.475
Signed, sealed, and delivered.

38:43.477 --> 38:44.593
Hey, is that the messenger?

38:44.595 --> 38:46.011
Is that...

38:46.013 --> 38:48.396
I think you're gonna
be very pleased

38:48.398 --> 38:50.348
- with what we worked out.
- I know I am.

38:50.350 --> 38:51.850
Ah.

38:51.852 --> 38:54.152
- You said "get a room."
- Would you be a dear

38:54.154 --> 38:56.521
and get me a turkey sandwich
from room service?

38:56.523 --> 38:57.856
Light on the mayo, extra mustard,

38:57.858 --> 38:58.857
and bread and butter pickles?

38:58.859 --> 39:01.159
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

39:01.161 --> 39:03.361
Okay, get that look off your face.

39:03.363 --> 39:04.663
We are consenting adults,

39:04.665 --> 39:06.231
and our Hankmed
business is handled.

39:06.233 --> 39:08.917
- I didn't say anything.
- No, you didn't have to.

39:08.919 --> 39:11.119
Welcome to my personal life.

39:11.121 --> 39:13.672
I make sure that I get
my fair share of fun

39:13.674 --> 39:17.125
whether it makes sense
on paper or not.

39:17.127 --> 39:18.510
Are you gonna stay
for room service?

39:18.512 --> 39:20.962
Uh, actually, I think
I'll take a rain check on that,

39:20.964 --> 39:22.764
but maybe we'll all
grab a drink later.

39:22.766 --> 39:24.349
- Yeah, that sounds fun.
- Okay.

39:24.351 --> 39:25.934
I look forward to working
with you and with Symphony.

39:25.936 --> 39:27.418
Aw.

39:27.420 --> 39:32.090
Oh, by the way, don't you have
a patient in Hungary?

39:32.092 --> 39:33.775
Why?

39:33.777 --> 39:35.193
I just got the weirdest phone
call from a doctor in Budapest

39:35.195 --> 39:38.897
about a clinical trial,
and he mentioned you.

39:38.899 --> 39:43.535
Yeah, my European patient's
interested in a local trial.

39:43.537 --> 39:44.786
What did you tell the doctor?

39:44.788 --> 39:46.955
I said I didn't know
anything about it.

39:46.957 --> 39:51.276
But that if Hank Lawson is
involved, I'm sure it's great.

39:51.278 --> 39:53.211
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

39:53.213 --> 39:54.296
Enjoy your bread and
butter pickles.

39:54.298 --> 39:56.798
Okay.

40:06.164 --> 40:08.197
You know...

40:08.199 --> 40:10.149
it kind of grows on you.

40:10.151 --> 40:13.036
- Art can do that.
- Hmm.

40:13.038 --> 40:15.672
Is it part of a collection?

40:15.674 --> 40:18.708
Is there, like, an orange circle
or a blue triangle?

40:18.710 --> 40:19.926
I've always wanted
a green crescent.

40:19.928 --> 40:21.327
That's why I'm asking.

40:21.329 --> 40:23.346
Are you comparing our piece
to lucky charms?

40:23.348 --> 40:25.882
How did you catch that? Yes!

40:25.884 --> 40:28.518
Mm.

40:28.520 --> 40:31.521
All right.

40:31.523 --> 40:33.139
So, took us a while,

40:33.141 --> 40:34.840
but I'm really glad
we're finally doing this.

40:34.842 --> 40:37.477
Me too. Budgets are important.

40:37.479 --> 40:38.644
Here.

40:38.646 --> 40:40.513
Okay.

40:40.515 --> 40:44.200
Um, does that look like
a reasonable amount

40:44.202 --> 40:45.952
to spend on entertainment
every month?

40:45.954 --> 40:47.704
Yeah, looks good to me.
If we want to spend more,

40:47.706 --> 40:49.372
we'll just talk to each other
about it first.

40:49.374 --> 40:51.290
Exactly.

40:51.292 --> 40:55.078
All right, next category,
beauty products.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.746
- Mm-hmm.
- Ooh.

40:56.748 --> 40:58.464
Skin care looks a little high.

40:58.466 --> 41:00.583
Um, I'm gonna ask you
to take your hand

41:00.585 --> 41:03.302
and rub the back of it
on my face, gently.

41:03.304 --> 41:07.223
- Ooh, say no more.
- That's what I'm talking about.

41:07.225 --> 41:08.758
Okay, moving right along.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.059
- To us.
- Cheers.

41:10.061 --> 41:11.561
To the newest members
of Symphony Health,

41:11.563 --> 41:15.214
I want to be the first to say
welcome to the family.

41:17.851 --> 41:19.018
Thank you, Shelby.

41:19.020 --> 41:20.520
We are so excited to be on board.

41:20.522 --> 41:22.054
I want to thank both of you

41:22.056 --> 41:23.573
for going above and beyond
the call of duty

41:23.575 --> 41:25.558
and hammering out the finer
points of this new relationship.

41:25.560 --> 41:27.527
Oh, Evan, you have no idea.

41:27.529 --> 41:28.828
This deal must be very different

41:28.830 --> 41:31.364
from your usual sports deals.

41:31.366 --> 41:32.949
- No, negotiating's negotiating.
- Yeah.

41:32.951 --> 41:34.283
When you're the best at
what you do, it doesn't matter

41:34.285 --> 41:36.119
if it's an athlete's
contract or Hank's.

41:36.121 --> 41:38.254
Wow, you're really a legend
in your own mind, huh?

41:38.256 --> 41:40.206
Uh-huh.

41:40.208 --> 41:42.125
Yeah, of course.

41:42.127 --> 41:45.795
I understand.

41:45.797 --> 41:48.381
What's up?

41:48.383 --> 41:50.016
That was Boris.

41:50.018 --> 41:52.301
Everything all right?

41:53.772 --> 41:56.189
The men he had trailing Milos
lost track of him.

41:57.808 --> 41:59.308
Maybe I screwed up.

41:59.310 --> 42:01.727
Maybe I... maybe I gave Milos
too much information.

42:01.729 --> 42:03.279
You think he got
suspicious of the plan?

42:03.281 --> 42:05.448
I hope not.

42:05.450 --> 42:07.600
What if he figured
out Boris is alive?

42:07.602 --> 42:08.818
If he did, what do we do?

42:08.820 --> 42:10.653
I don't know, Evan. I don't know.

42:10.655 --> 42:13.206
I mean, I've never done
something like this before.

42:13.208 --> 42:14.707
Well, we know what happened
to the last guy

42:14.709 --> 42:17.109
Milos got suspicious of.
He had him killed.

42:17.923 --> 42:19.923
Actually, he did it himself.

42:20.432 --> 42:22.432
In the middle of the street.

42:22.457 --> 42:34.457
