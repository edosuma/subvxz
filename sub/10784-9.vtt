00:01.458 --> 00:03.500
Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:03.500 --> 00:05.500
SO HOW'S IT GOING?
BILLY KONRAD.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.667
BILLY'S JUST AN OLD FRIEND
OF MINE FROM NEW YORK.

00:07.667 --> 00:08.333
IS HE REALLY JUST A FRIEND,

00:08.333 --> 00:09.834
OR IS HE SOMETHING MORE?

00:09.834 --> 00:10.667
I HEAR, UH, JEN'S EX

00:10.667 --> 00:12.333
HAS BEEN LURKING
AROUND CAPESIDE.

00:12.333 --> 00:14.083
YOU'RE REALLY,
REALLY ENJOYING THE FACT

00:14.083 --> 00:15.750
THAT JEN'S EX IS
IN TOWN, AREN'T YOU?

00:15.750 --> 00:17.542
I'M NOT ONE TO GET
IN THE WAY OF TRUE LOVE.

00:20.583 --> 00:23.083
GOOD-BYE, BILLY.

00:23.083 --> 00:25.250
YOU JUST CAN'T
COME INTO TOWN,
MAKE ME FALL FOR YOU

00:25.250 --> 00:28.000
AND THEN--
I NEED TO TRY
LIFE ON MY OWN...

00:28.000 --> 00:30.166
FOR A WHILE.

00:38.291 --> 00:40.834
DAWSON. THE NEIGHBOR
GIRL DUMPED YOU.

00:40.834 --> 00:43.125
NO ONE DIED.
JUST GET OVER IT.

00:43.125 --> 00:44.875
48 HOURS AGO.

00:44.875 --> 00:48.375
I DON'T THINK I'VE
EXCEEDED THE STATUTE
OF LIMITATIONS ON ANGST.

00:48.375 --> 00:50.875
IT'S NOT A MATTER
OF TIME, DAWSON.
IT'S A MATTER OF DEGREE.

00:50.875 --> 00:52.208
I MEAN,
YOU HAVEN'T EATEN,

00:52.208 --> 00:55.041
AND YOU STARE
AT JEN'S HOUSE LIKE
IT'S GOING TO DISAPPEAR.

00:55.041 --> 00:57.542
AND I'VE SEEN YOU
AT SCHOOL--YOU SPY.
IT'S TWISTED.

00:57.542 --> 01:01.041
I'M ALMOST AFRAID TO ASK
WHAT MOVIE YOU BROUGHT
BACK TONIGHT.

01:01.041 --> 01:01.625
SID AND NANCY.

01:01.625 --> 01:04.041
SEE?

01:04.041 --> 01:06.375
SEE, YOUR PROBLEM
IS THAT YOU'RE
GETTING OFF ON THIS.

01:06.375 --> 01:07.583
WELL, SORRY, JOEY.

01:07.583 --> 01:10.000
IT'S TOUGH TO COME UP WITH
CREATIVE MOPING STRATEGIES

01:10.000 --> 01:11.834
ONCE I REALIZED
THAT EVERYTHING I'M ABOUT

01:11.834 --> 01:13.500
IS EXACTLY
WHAT TURNED HER OFF.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.375
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN...
LEARN TO DANCE OR GET
A NEW HAIRCUT OR SOMETHING.

01:16.375 --> 01:18.834
DAWSON, SHE DUMPED YOU,
NOT YOUR BELIEF SYSTEM.

01:18.834 --> 01:22.250
SHE REJECTED ROMANCE,
HONESTY, AND RESPECT.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.166
EVERY TIME I SEE BILLY
OUTSIDE OF HER HOUSE,
I'M REMINDED OF THAT.

01:24.166 --> 01:26.917
YEAH, WELL, EVERYTHING
REMINDS YOU OF HER.

01:26.917 --> 01:29.291
YEAH.

01:29.291 --> 01:31.500
DAWSON, YOU'VE KNOWN
THE GIRL FOR 3 MONTHS.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.417
HOW CAN EVERYTHING
POSSIBLY REMIND YOU
OF HER?

01:34.417 --> 01:36.083
I DON'T KNOW, JOEY.
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.

01:36.083 --> 01:37.500
IT JUST DOES.

01:39.750 --> 01:43.750
FINE. LET'S JUST WATCH
THE MOVIE,

01:43.750 --> 01:47.333
THIS CONVERSATION
IS BECOMING
FAR TOO DISTURBING.

01:53.750 --> 01:56.959
[DAWSON GROANS]

03:30.625 --> 03:32.875
Jen: HEY, GRAMS, HAVE YOU
SEEN MY GREEN SHIRT?

03:32.875 --> 03:34.208
I--I THINK
IT NEEDS IRONING.

03:34.208 --> 03:37.417
Grams: OH, YES, DEAR,
I THOUGHT I SAW IT
IN YOUR CLOSET.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.708
OH!

03:39.708 --> 03:42.000
YOU LEFT IT
ON THE DRESSER.

03:43.583 --> 03:45.917
JENNIFER, WOULD YOU
COME UP HERE NOW, PLEASE,

03:45.917 --> 03:48.708
AND BRING THE TELEPHONE?

03:48.708 --> 03:49.792
AND YOU WOULD BE?

03:49.792 --> 03:50.917
QUITE COMFORTABLE,
THANKS.

03:50.917 --> 03:53.125
I WANT A NAME.

03:53.125 --> 03:54.708
BILLY.

03:54.708 --> 03:59.125
BILLY. OH--OH, YES,
I'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU BEFORE.

04:00.083 --> 04:02.166
OK, I GOT THE PHONE--

04:02.166 --> 04:04.417
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:04.417 --> 04:06.125
WORD'S OUT
YOU DROPPED DAWSON,

04:06.125 --> 04:09.041
SO I JUST THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT BE LOOKING FOR
A SUITABLE REPLACEMENT.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.417
WELL, IF HE'S NOT OUT
OF MY HOUSE IN 2 MINUTES,

04:11.417 --> 04:13.625
I'M CALLING
THE NATIONAL GUARD.

04:13.625 --> 04:16.333
[WHISPERING]
And then I would like
a serious word with you.

04:16.333 --> 04:17.791
GREAT TO MEET YOU.

04:19.250 --> 04:22.083
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE LEAVING.

04:22.083 --> 04:26.291
YOU KNOW, MY CAR WAS PACKED,
AND--AND I REALLY WAS,
JENNY.

04:26.291 --> 04:27.583
BUT THEN WORD TRICKLED DOWN,

04:27.583 --> 04:30.625
AND I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
BE IN MY BEST INTEREST

04:30.625 --> 04:31.750
TO STICK AROUND
A LITTLE LONGER.

04:31.750 --> 04:34.458
WELL, THEN WHY DON'T
I CLARIFY THINGS FOR YOU?

04:34.458 --> 04:37.041
JUST BECAUSE DAWSON
AND I ARE ON HIATUS

04:37.041 --> 04:39.542
DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S SOME
VACANCY I'M LOOKING TO FILL.

04:39.542 --> 04:42.041
LET'S JUST SAY THERE
HAPPENED TO BE THIS GUY.

04:42.041 --> 04:46.083
SOME GUY YOU HAD A...
INTENSE CONNECTION WITH.

04:46.083 --> 04:48.917
WELL, THEN I MIGHT
THINK YOU'D BE OPEN TO
THE POSSIBILITY, RIGHT?

04:48.917 --> 04:50.250
I'D HAVE TO SAY NO.

04:50.250 --> 04:54.917
BUT I'D ALSO LIKE
TO ADD "NOT A CHANCE"
AND "NEVER AGAIN."

05:03.208 --> 05:05.083
YOU USED TO BE FUN,
YOU KNOW THAT?

05:05.083 --> 05:07.542
NO. I USED TO BE WEAK
AND VULNERABLE.

05:12.041 --> 05:14.125
YEAH, WELL, NEXT TIME
YOU ALTER YOUR PERSONALITY,

05:14.125 --> 05:16.417
LET ME KNOW IN ADVANCE.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.375
IT'LL SAVE ME IN GAS MONEY.

05:36.291 --> 05:37.417
YOU KNOW, I'M BEGINNING
TO DOUBT YOUR SINCERITY

05:37.417 --> 05:39.667
WHEN YOU TELL ME
YOU'RE LEAVING.

05:39.667 --> 05:41.250
HEY, JUST THE MAN
I WAS LOOKING FOR.

05:41.250 --> 05:43.041
WHAT CAN I PROVIDE YOU
WITH THIS TIME, BILLY?

05:43.041 --> 05:44.333
A PLACE TO STAY?

05:44.333 --> 05:47.166
OR JUST ANOTHER CHANCE
TO COMPLETELY SCREW UP
MY LIFE?

05:47.166 --> 05:49.875
YOU KNOW, DESPITE
OUTWARD APPEARANCES,

05:49.875 --> 05:51.708
YOU AND I ACTUALLY
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

05:51.708 --> 05:53.166
RIGHT.

05:53.166 --> 05:55.291
WE'VE BOTH GOT
OUR HEARTS BROKEN
BY THE SAME GIRL,

05:55.291 --> 05:56.250
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:56.250 --> 05:57.375
JEN DIDN'T
FLEE THE STATE

05:57.375 --> 05:58.417
TO GET AWAY
FROM ME.

05:58.417 --> 06:00.500
GIVE HER TIME.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.667
AND, MAN, IF I LIVED
50 YARDS AWAY FROM HER,

06:03.667 --> 06:05.834
I SWEAR TO YOU,
I'D GO INSANE.

06:05.834 --> 06:10.333
I'D STARE UP AT
HER WINDOW, WONDERING
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

06:10.333 --> 06:12.417
SHE'S TALKING ON THE PHONE.
WHO IS SHE TALKING TO?

06:12.417 --> 06:15.542
AND IF SHE'S
LISTENING TO MUSIC,

06:15.542 --> 06:18.291
WHO DO THOSE SONGS
REMIND HER OF?

06:18.291 --> 06:20.625
DOES SHE STILL
THINK ABOUT ME?

06:20.625 --> 06:24.708
AND IF SO, DOES SHE THINK
ABOUT ME HALF AS MUCH
AS I THINK ABOUT HER?

06:24.708 --> 06:27.500
SEE WHAT I MEAN?
COMMON GROUND.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.041
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS,

06:29.041 --> 06:30.583
THERE'S A SIMPLE CURE
FOR ALL THIS.

06:30.583 --> 06:32.458
YEAH? WHAT'S THAT?

06:32.458 --> 06:34.417
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG.
JEN IS A GREAT GIRL,

06:34.417 --> 06:37.667
BUT LAST TIME I CHECKED,
SHE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE.

06:37.667 --> 06:40.542
WHAT ARE YOU, UNCONVINCED?

06:40.542 --> 06:43.041
LOOK, TAKE
A LITTLE RIDE WITH ME

06:43.041 --> 06:45.000
AND LET ME
ILLUSTRATE MY POINT.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.625
TAKE A RIDE WHERE?

06:46.625 --> 06:47.875
PROVIDENCE.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.583
THERE'S THIS CLUB THERE.
IT'S A BIT OF A DIVE,
BUT...

06:50.583 --> 06:53.208
ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE
IN ONE RESPECT.

06:53.208 --> 06:58.583
IT LIES EXACTLY EQUIDISTANT
BETWEEN A PAIR
OF WOMEN'S COLLEGES.

06:58.583 --> 07:00.333
COEDS WALL TO WALL,
DAWSON.

07:00.333 --> 07:03.000
WELL, CAN I GET IN?
I'M NOT EXACTLY LEGAL.

07:03.000 --> 07:03.917
I KNOW THE BOUNCER.

07:06.083 --> 07:06.917
OF COURSE,
THERE'S SCHOOL.

07:06.917 --> 07:08.875
AND WHAT'S
WAITING FOR YOU THERE?

07:08.875 --> 07:10.834
ANOTHER DAY
WONDERING ABOUT JENNY?

07:10.834 --> 07:11.917
WHERE SHE IS, WHEN
YOU'LL SEE HER NEXT,

07:11.917 --> 07:14.542
WHAT FOOTBALL PLAYER
IS SHE HAVING LUNCH WITH?

07:14.542 --> 07:17.083
YOU MADE YOUR POINT.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.917
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:18.917 --> 07:20.959
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEED:
TO GET AWAY FROM HER,
TO GET AWAY FROM HERE.

07:20.959 --> 07:23.458
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:23.458 --> 07:24.917
SHE'S GONNA FREAK
WHEN I'M NOT THERE.

07:24.917 --> 07:29.166
IT'D BE GOOD TO LET
HER WONDER ABOUT ME
FOR A WHILE.

07:29.166 --> 07:31.083
THERE YOU GO.

07:44.875 --> 07:48.291
HEY...WARREN GARY.

07:48.291 --> 07:50.208
I'M ON MY WAY TO SCHOOL.
YOU NEED A LIFT?

07:50.208 --> 07:51.375
AH, NO, THANKS.

07:51.375 --> 07:54.000
I'M WAITING
FOR TED BUNDY.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.750
WELL, TED'S
A LUCKY MAN.

07:56.750 --> 07:59.333
TED BUNDY IS DEAD.
HE WAS A SERIAL...

07:59.333 --> 08:01.166
KILLER.
YEAH, I KNOW.

08:01.166 --> 08:03.792
EXECUTED IN FLORIDA.
CLAIMED PORN MADE HIM
DO IT.

08:03.792 --> 08:06.792
SO, COME ON,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
I NEED THE MERIT BADGE.

08:06.792 --> 08:07.333
AND WHICH BADGE
IS THAT?

08:07.333 --> 08:09.291
COMMUNITY SERVICE.

08:09.291 --> 08:10.792
I'M GOING TO SAY
YOU WERE 80...AND BLIND.

08:10.792 --> 08:13.542
WELL, I'M SURE YOU'LL
BE AN EAGLE SCOUT BEFORE
THE END OF THE DAY.

08:13.542 --> 08:17.291
EXACTLY. SO WHAT
DO YOU SAY? COME ON.

08:17.291 --> 08:18.583
HELP ME OUT HERE.

08:37.667 --> 08:42.250
SO, IS THE AIR COLD,
OR ARE YOU JUST
HAPPY TO SEE ME?

08:42.250 --> 08:46.834
YOU HAD TO DO IT.
YOU HAD TO LIVE UP
TO THE EXPECTATIONS.

08:46.834 --> 08:50.166
DOES IT BOTHER YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOU SINGLE-HANDEDLY
PERPETUATE A STEREOTYPE?

08:50.166 --> 08:51.917
UH...

08:51.917 --> 08:56.125
WHICH ANSWER MEANS
WE GET FRIENDLY DOWN
IN THE SAND TOGETHER?

08:56.125 --> 08:59.667
YOU KNOW, IF--IF HAVING SEX
WITH YOU WOULD END FAMINE,
DISEASE, AND WAR,

08:59.667 --> 09:02.250
AND IF KISSING YOU
WOULD BRING ON A NEW AGE
OF ENLIGHTENMENT,

09:02.250 --> 09:03.166
I STILL
WOULDN'T--
YOU KNOW
SOMETHING?

09:03.166 --> 09:05.708
YOU TALK A LOT.

09:08.208 --> 09:10.000
THAT'S BETTER.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.875
SO, WHAT, IS THAT
ALL YOU AND YOUR
BOYFRIEND DAWSON--

09:14.875 --> 09:16.583
AND I USE THE TERM
LOOSELY--DO?

09:16.583 --> 09:17.708
TALK?

09:17.708 --> 09:20.875
YOU DON'T NEED TO USE
THE TERM AT ALL, WARREN.

09:20.875 --> 09:22.834
DAWSON IS
NOT MY BOYFRIEND.

09:22.834 --> 09:25.834
IT WAS THE "BOY" PART
I WAS REFERRING TO.

09:25.834 --> 09:29.291
WELL, HAVE YOU
EVER SEEN THE GUY
THROW A BASEBALL?

09:29.291 --> 09:31.208
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
THERE IS NO CORRELATION

09:31.208 --> 09:32.625
BETWEEN A SLIDER
AND A SPERM COUNT.

09:32.625 --> 09:34.291
WELL,
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

09:34.291 --> 09:36.792
I MEAN, YOU'RE
OBVIOUSLY A VIRGIN.

09:40.792 --> 09:44.000
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT
DAWSON AND I HAVEN'T BEEN
GOING AT IT FOR YEARS?

09:44.000 --> 09:47.625
I MEAN, WE COULD BE
ANNOTATING THE KAMA SUTRA
FOR ALL YOU KNOW.

09:50.458 --> 09:54.291
YOU KNOW,
I MAY BE A VIRGIN,
BUT BELIEVE ME,

09:54.291 --> 09:54.792
IT'S BY CHOICE.

10:04.458 --> 10:05.917
YOU COULD HAVE
WAITED IN THE CAR.

10:05.917 --> 10:09.583
DON'T WORRY. I WON'T
TELL ANYONE WE'RE TOGETHER.

10:09.583 --> 10:12.041
HI.
HEY.

10:12.041 --> 10:13.000
WHAT'S HE UP TO?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.417
WE'RE CUTTING
OUT OF HERE.

10:14.417 --> 10:17.458
WE'RE GOING UP
TO A CLUB IN PROVIDENCE
THAT BILLY KNOWS.

10:17.458 --> 10:19.625
AH. FINALLY.
DAWSON'S EVIL TWIN.

10:19.625 --> 10:21.333
THIS HAS BEEN A MUCH
ANTICIPATED PLEASURE.

10:21.333 --> 10:22.375
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:22.375 --> 10:23.583
YOU'RE CUTTING CLASS
TO GO TO A NIGHTCLUB.

10:23.583 --> 10:25.708
YOU'RE ASKING
WHAT I'M DOING?

10:25.708 --> 10:26.875
I'M COMING
WITH YOU, MAN.

10:26.875 --> 10:28.333
I WOULDN'T MISS THIS
FOR THE WORLD.

10:28.333 --> 10:30.333
BILLY?
HEY.

10:30.333 --> 10:31.792
GREAT.
SO, WE'RE
READY TO GO?

10:31.792 --> 10:35.500
YEAH. JUST GOT TO TURN
IN MY MATH HOMEWORK,
AND WE'RE OUTTA HERE.

10:35.500 --> 10:38.959
YEAH. WALK ON
THE WILD SIDE.

10:38.959 --> 10:40.625
LISTEN, I HEARD SOMETHING
THIS MORNING,

10:40.625 --> 10:43.917
AND I THOUGHT
THAT YOU SHOULD--

10:44.792 --> 10:47.291
AT THE RISK OF
SOUNDING REDUNDANT,

10:47.291 --> 10:48.291
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:48.291 --> 10:50.417
THE BOYS JUST HAD
TO WRAP UP A FEW THINGS

10:50.417 --> 10:51.959
BEFORE WE LEFT, SO,
UH...

10:51.959 --> 10:52.917
GOOD MORNING.

10:52.917 --> 10:54.166
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

10:54.166 --> 10:57.667
I'M TAKING PACEY
AND YOUR BOY ON
A LITTLE ROAD TRIP.

10:57.667 --> 11:00.291
FUNNY, BUT, UH,
IN THE MIDST OF ALL
THE CONFUSION,

11:00.291 --> 11:02.959
DAWSON AND I
ACTUALLY STUMBLED UPON
SOME COMMON GROUND.

11:02.959 --> 11:05.083
I DON'T THINK I LIKE
THE SOUND OF THIS, BILLY.

11:05.083 --> 11:08.166
THE LAST THING THAT
DAWSON NEEDS IS TO BE
PULLED DOWN BY YOU.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.125
I SWEAR TO YOU. DAWSON
WAS SIMPLY COMPLAINING

11:10.125 --> 11:12.458
ABOUT HOW A GUY
CAN'T SEEM TO GET ANY
AROUND HERE.

11:12.458 --> 11:15.417
SO I TOLD HIM
ABOUT THIS LITTLE
PLACE I KNOW.

11:15.417 --> 11:17.625
WHAT KIND OF PLACE?

11:17.625 --> 11:20.667
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
THAT THE WOMEN TAKE CASH

11:20.667 --> 11:22.708
AND ARE REMARKABLY
FRIENDLY.

11:22.708 --> 11:24.667
YOU'RE TAKING HIM
TO A WHOREHOUSE?

11:26.333 --> 11:28.708
AH, THERE'S
HIS HOLINESS NOW.

11:28.708 --> 11:31.583
WELL, GIRLS,
GOTTA RUN.

11:31.583 --> 11:33.667
I SEE SAINT DAWSON'S
CHAMPING AT THE BIT.

11:33.667 --> 11:36.458
SO...COME ON.
YEAH.

11:36.458 --> 11:37.917
EXCUSE ME.

11:37.917 --> 11:39.708
WE'RE NOT REALLY
GONNA GO TO A--

11:39.708 --> 11:41.333
NO. I WAS JUST
KIDDING AROUND.

11:41.333 --> 11:44.000
LET'S GO.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.333
GOD, I KNOW I'VE NEVER
REALLY HAD A WHOLE LOT
OF FAITH IN GUYS, BUT I...

11:48.333 --> 11:50.583
I DON'T KNOW, I JUST
THOUGHT DAWSON WAS DIFFERENT.

11:50.583 --> 11:52.208
YEAH, HE'S DIFFERENT.

11:52.208 --> 11:55.542
UNFORTUNATELY,
HE'S JUST NOT AS
DIFFERENT AS WE THOUGHT.

11:55.542 --> 11:58.542
YEAH. LISTEN,
UH, JOEY...

11:58.542 --> 12:01.458
YOU KNOW THAT--THAT
FOOTBALL PLAYER, WARREN?

12:01.458 --> 12:02.667
WHAT?

12:02.667 --> 12:04.667
YOU DIDN'T SLEEP
WITH HIM, DID YOU?

12:04.667 --> 12:08.417
YEAH, I HAD SEX
WITH WARREN GARY,

12:08.417 --> 12:12.625
UH, RIGHT AFTER I GAVE
THE SPONGE BATH
TO THE NAVY PILOTS.

12:12.625 --> 12:14.125
WHY WOULD YOU
EVEN ASK ME THAT?

12:14.125 --> 12:17.625
HE'S TELLING EVERYONE
YOU DID.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.917
Billy: I'M GONNA GO
DOWNSTAIRS, GET A DRINK.

12:34.917 --> 12:36.792
Dawson: ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT HERE.

12:36.792 --> 12:39.250
Pacey: ALL RIGHT,
ONE MORE TIME.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.875
DAWSON, YOU'RE NOT
THE TYPE OF GUY

12:40.875 --> 12:42.792
WHO DOES SOMETHING BAD
JUST 'CAUSE IT FEELS GOOD.

12:42.792 --> 12:45.542
WELL, THERE'S AN
OXYMORON TO LIVE BY.

12:45.542 --> 12:47.875
WHAT? YOU WANT
EXAMPLES OF THIS?

12:50.375 --> 12:52.041
ALL RIGHT. WHAT WAS
THE FIRST THING,

12:52.041 --> 12:53.417
THE VERY FIRST THING
YOU DID,

12:53.417 --> 12:55.500
AFTER ANNOUNCING THIS
LITTLE ROAD TRIP OF OURS?

12:55.500 --> 12:58.250
REMEMBER? YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT IT WAS, DON'T YOU?

12:58.250 --> 12:59.417
YOU TURNED IN
YOUR MATH HOMEWORK, MAN.

12:59.417 --> 13:02.417
HEY, THOSE ARE NOT EXACTLY
THE ACTIONS OF A REBEL.

13:02.417 --> 13:04.041
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THAT.

13:04.041 --> 13:05.834
YOU JUST--YOU JUST CARE
ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE
THINK ABOUT YOU.

13:05.834 --> 13:08.333
YOU'RE THAT NICE
LEERY BOY, MAN.

13:08.333 --> 13:09.875
YOU LIKE BEING
THE NICE LEERY BOY.

13:09.875 --> 13:11.250
OH, AND YOU'RE
ANY DIFFERENT?

13:11.250 --> 13:14.000
HEY, PLEASE. JUST TALK
TO THE SCHOOL BOARD

13:14.000 --> 13:15.834
OR TAKE A GLANCE
AT MY PERMANENT RECORD.

13:15.834 --> 13:17.959
THERE'S NO COMPARISON
BETWEEN YOU AND I, DAWSON.

13:17.959 --> 13:21.125
EVERYBODY KNOWS
YOU'RE A REGULAR
RICHIE CUNNINGHAM.

13:21.125 --> 13:24.667
THAT GUY,
HE'S THE FONZ.

13:24.667 --> 13:26.000
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.
THAT MAKES YOU POTSIE.

13:29.917 --> 13:32.417
WE NEED TO TALK.

13:32.417 --> 13:36.125
SHE NEEDS TO TALK.

13:36.125 --> 13:37.083
[LAUGHTER]

13:49.917 --> 13:51.291
WELL...

13:51.291 --> 13:53.041
IT WASN'T VERY
MEMORABLE, WARREN.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.291
WHAT?

13:54.291 --> 13:57.208
THE SEX. IN FACT,
I CAN'T SEEM
TO REMEMBER IT AT ALL.

13:57.208 --> 13:58.000
WHY DON'T YOU REFRESH
MY MEMORY?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.834
IT WAS ACTUALLY
PRETTY GOOD,

14:00.834 --> 14:03.500
ALTHOUGH YOU DID
EVENTUALLY COMPLAIN
OF FATIGUE.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.417
WHAT IS GOING ON IN
THAT TWISTED HEAD OF YOURS?

14:06.417 --> 14:07.625
LOOK.

14:07.625 --> 14:10.041
THIS CAN BE
A WIN-WIN.

14:11.959 --> 14:14.041
EXPLAIN.

14:14.041 --> 14:15.166
OUR REPS.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.250
OK, I'VE GOT ONE
TO LIVE UP TO.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.333
YOU HAVE ONE TO...

14:19.333 --> 14:22.166
LIVE DOWN.

14:22.166 --> 14:24.166
WHAT? AND PEOPLE THINKING
WE'RE DOING THE DEED

14:24.166 --> 14:26.583
IS GOING TO HELP
MY PRECIOUS REPUTATION?

14:26.583 --> 14:28.291
WELL, YOU KNOW
HOW IN BASEBALL

14:28.291 --> 14:29.333
THERE ARE MAJOR
AND MINOR LEAGUES?

14:29.333 --> 14:31.083
YEAH.

14:31.083 --> 14:34.458
WELL, THINK OF THIS
AS YOUR CALL-UP
TO THE SHOW.

14:34.458 --> 14:37.875
NO MORE SHAGGING FLY
BALLS WITH WASHOUTS
AND WANNA-BES.

14:37.875 --> 14:39.125
YOU ARE SUCH A BASTARD.

14:39.125 --> 14:40.000
IF YOU'RE THE MAJOR
LEAGUES, WARREN,

14:40.000 --> 14:43.041
I HOPE I NEVER
GET OUT OF A-BALL.

14:43.041 --> 14:45.625
[LOUDLY]
HEY, LOOK. I NEVER SAID
I'D BE YOUR BOYFRIEND.

14:49.875 --> 14:52.291

14:52.291 --> 14:54.208
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]

14:56.708 --> 14:57.959

15:08.750 --> 15:11.542
I NEVER BELIEVED IT,
YOU KNOW.

15:11.542 --> 15:14.583
SURE. THAT'S
WHY YOU ASKED.

15:14.583 --> 15:18.375
I ONLY ASKED BECAUSE
I WAS CONCERNED, JOEY.

15:18.375 --> 15:22.083
BUT--BUT I WOULD HAVE
BET ANYTHING AGAINST IT.

15:22.083 --> 15:24.750
BESIDES, I...

15:24.750 --> 15:26.750
UH...

15:26.750 --> 15:28.708
BESIDES, WHAT?

15:28.708 --> 15:34.333
I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS
I ALWAYS PICTURED YOU
WITH SOMEONE DIFFERENT.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.125
SOMEONE LIKE...

15:39.917 --> 15:43.875
YOU KNOW, JUST--
JUST A DIFFERENT TYPE.

15:43.875 --> 15:46.417
WALKING UPRIGHT?

15:46.417 --> 15:51.291
YEAH. OPPOSABLE THUMBS.
THE...WHOLE BIT.

15:51.291 --> 15:55.834
AND MAYBE SOMEONE JUST
A TAD MORE SENSITIVE
THAN WARREN GARY.

15:55.834 --> 15:58.875
YEAH, WELL...

15:58.875 --> 16:00.750
IN MY EXPERIENCE,
EVEN THE SENSITIVE ONES

16:00.750 --> 16:02.083
CAN LET YOU DOWN
WITH THE BEST OF THEM.

16:04.041 --> 16:07.792
YOU KNOW, JOEY,
MAYBE DAWSON ISN'T--

16:07.792 --> 16:09.208
LOOK, I DIDN'T SAY
A THING ABOUT DAWSON.

16:12.667 --> 16:15.708
AND AS FAR AS WARREN
AND HIS PATHETIC FANTASIES
GO, YOU KNOW,

16:15.708 --> 16:16.667
WHAT HARM CAN A GUY DO?

16:16.667 --> 16:18.625
I MEAN, BEING CALLED
A FOOTBALL GROUPIE

16:18.625 --> 16:20.667
COULD DESCRIBE HALF
THE GIRLS IN THIS SCHOOL,

16:20.667 --> 16:22.041
SO IT'S NOT
THAT BIG A DEAL.

16:22.041 --> 16:23.291
JOEY, I MAY BE
OVERSTEPPING
MY BOUNDARIES HERE,

16:23.291 --> 16:29.000
BUT, UH...
I THINK I KNOW A WAY
TO GET WARREN BACK.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.792
WHAT? DO YOU KNOW HOW
TO MAKE A VOODOO DOLL
OR SOMETHING?

16:31.792 --> 16:33.000
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.667
YOU KNOW,
GUYS LIKE WARREN
HAVE BEEN GETTING AWAY

16:36.667 --> 16:39.583
WITH THIS KIND OF STUFF
FOR WAY TOO LONG.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.208
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY,
JOEY?

16:41.208 --> 16:42.250
INTERESTED IN
A LITTLE PAYBACK?

16:44.959 --> 16:47.125
ALL RIGHT,
I'M LISTENING.

16:54.375 --> 16:56.000
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.125
YOU KNOW WHEN CARTOON
CHARACTERS ARE TRYING
TO MAKE A DECISION,

16:59.125 --> 17:01.834
AND THE GOOD ANGEL
POPS UP ON ONE SHOULDER

17:01.834 --> 17:03.458
AND YOU GOT THE LITTLE
DEVIL ON THE OTHER?

17:03.458 --> 17:05.165
YEAH.

17:05.165 --> 17:09.165
WELL, I DON'T HAVE
A GOOD ANGEL, DAWSON.
I HAVE YOU.

17:09.165 --> 17:10.541
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN THE GIG.

17:10.541 --> 17:13.165
IT DOESN'T WORK
FOR ME ANYMORE.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.416
I SWEAR TO GOD,
YOU TWO SOUND
LIKE MY PARENTS.

17:15.416 --> 17:17.750
HANG TIGHT.
I'M GOING TO GO SEE

17:17.750 --> 17:19.250
WHAT THE DELIVERANCE
TWINS ARE UP TO.

17:19.250 --> 17:22.375
YOU KNOW, NEED I REMIND YOU
AGAIN OF THE ILL-FATED
TOILET PAPERING

17:22.375 --> 17:24.040
OF COACH ROLAND'S HOUSE.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.750
THERE YOU GO AGAIN.
EQUATING FUN WITH
YOUTHFUL INDISCRETIONS.

17:26.750 --> 17:29.458
YOUTHFUL INDISCRETIONS?
WHAT, AM I RUNNING
FOR THE SENATE?

17:29.458 --> 17:32.792
OK, GRANTED, DAWSON. FOR
HIGH-MINDED CONVERSATION,
YOU'RE THE MAN.

17:32.792 --> 17:34.125
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING,

17:34.125 --> 17:36.000
YOU'RE BETTER AT VERBIAGE
THAN ACTUAL VERBS.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.708
VERBS?

17:37.708 --> 17:39.500
YEAH, ACTION WORDS.
REVEL, CAROUSE, PARTY.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.708
WHAT YEAR WAS IT
EXACTLY WHEN PARTY
BECAME A VERB?

17:41.708 --> 17:44.083
THE YEAR THAT
YOU AND I CAME INTO
HIGH SCHOOL, DAWSON.

17:44.083 --> 17:45.458
OK, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME
ON THIS ONE.

17:45.458 --> 17:49.208
SOMETIMES FRIENDSHIP MEANS
TAKING PART IN STUPID STUFF.

17:49.208 --> 17:51.375
NO JUDGMENTS,
NO QUESTIONS ASKED,

17:51.375 --> 17:53.041
AND NO DECONSTRUCTION
OF THE EVENTS.

17:53.041 --> 17:54.708
YOU DON'T THINK
I'M CAPABLE OF THAT?

17:54.708 --> 17:57.708
LET'S JUST SAY
I'VE SEEN NO EVIDENCE
TO THE CONTRARY.

17:57.708 --> 17:58.625
I DON'T LIKE
THOSE GUYS DOWN THERE.

17:58.625 --> 18:01.458
WHAT'S UP?

18:01.458 --> 18:05.458
Billy: THEY'RE HARASSING
EVERYONE FROM THE SEA GULLS
TO THE SENIOR CITIZENS.

18:05.458 --> 18:08.417
IT'S NOT REALLY
MY IDEA OF FUN.

18:08.417 --> 18:10.208
WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GIVE THEM A LITTLE
INSTANT KARMA, HUH?

18:10.208 --> 18:13.041
MAYBE, UH...A BANANA
IN THE TAILPIPE?

18:13.041 --> 18:14.959
SEE, I WAS JUST THINKING
WE COULD SLASH THEIR
TIRES OR SOMETHING.

18:14.959 --> 18:17.417
WELL, THAT'S
IMAGINATIVE.

18:17.417 --> 18:17.875
WELL, YOU GOT
A BETTER IDEA?

18:17.875 --> 18:20.417
YEAH, I DO.

18:20.417 --> 18:22.083
OH, YEAH. I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE THIS ONE.

18:22.083 --> 18:24.125
GOOD ANGEL THIS,
PACEY.

18:24.125 --> 18:27.959
DID YOU GUYS EVER SEE
AMERICAN GRAFFITI?

18:32.125 --> 18:34.917
WELL, WELL, WELL.

18:36.750 --> 18:39.083

IN THE BACKSEAT.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.708
YEAH, WELL, YOU CAN ADD
"WE DON'T NEED PROTECTION"
TO THAT LIST.

19:03.708 --> 19:07.583
WHAT?

19:07.583 --> 19:11.125
I AM SO STUPID.

19:11.125 --> 19:15.041
WAIT. WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING?

19:17.959 --> 19:20.542
WELL, HE STARTED OFF,

19:23.583 --> 19:26.333
HE'D BE SO SWEET.

19:26.333 --> 19:30.291
AND ONE TIME HE...HE WON
ME THIS STUFFED FROG

19:30.291 --> 19:31.291

THEY PAY SEEMS TO BE

ALL ABOUT NUMBERS.

24:56.708 --> 24:57.625
NUMBERS?

24:57.625 --> 24:58.959
ODDS.
DON'T WASTE TIME.

24:58.959 --> 25:01.208
YOU'LL KNOW
WITHIN 15 SECONDS

25:01.208 --> 25:02.875
WHETHER A WOMAN WANTS
TO SEE YOU NAKED.

25:02.875 --> 25:04.834
IF THE ANSWER IS NO,
YOU BAIL.

25:04.834 --> 25:07.417
WHO CARES? YOU KNOW,
THERE'S PLENTY MORE
WHERE THEY CAME FROM.

25:07.417 --> 25:08.542
BUT THAT'S WHY
YOU ASK 10.

25:08.542 --> 25:10.500
WHATEVER YOU GOT TO DO
TO SEAL THE DEAL,

25:10.500 --> 25:14.625
AND PULL THE TRIGGER.
POW!

25:14.625 --> 25:16.083
HELLO.

25:16.083 --> 25:20.166
WELL, WISH ME LUCK,
BOYS, 'CAUSE
HERE I GO.

25:23.500 --> 25:26.792
SO, WHO'S IT
GONNA BE, BUDDY?

25:26.792 --> 25:29.959
TIME'S A-WASTING.
WE DON'T GOT
ALL NIGHT.

25:30.750 --> 25:31.750
HI, WHAT'S UP?

25:33.083 --> 25:34.834
FOUND HER.

25:42.083 --> 25:46.917
HI. MY NAME--
MY NAME IS DAWSON.

25:46.917 --> 25:52.750
OH, YOU'RE DAWSON.
WOW, YEAH, ALL RIGHT!
GOOD TO KNOW.

25:56.250 --> 26:01.083
HEY, THERE.
I'M THE DRUMMER
FOR PEARL JAM. YOU?

26:01.083 --> 26:02.792
YOU'RE DUMBER
THAN WHO?

26:07.083 --> 26:10.750
LOOK, I--I JUST WANT
TO LET YOU KNOW THAT
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND

26:10.750 --> 26:12.291
THE ABSURDITY
OF THIS MOMENT.

26:12.291 --> 26:17.250
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT OF
SENDING OVER A DRINK
OR SAYING SOMETHING CLEVER

26:17.250 --> 26:19.125
AND WHAT'S YOUR SIGN?

26:19.125 --> 26:21.750
YOU KNOW, I FIGURED
DIRECTNESS WOULD BE
THE BEST APPROACH.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.708
I.E., MY NAME IS DAWSON.

26:23.708 --> 26:26.041
NOT THAT MY NAME
IN IT OF ITSELF
SHOULD IMPRESS YOU,

26:26.041 --> 26:29.583
BUT KIND OF IN THE HOPES
THAT YOU MIGHT IN RESPONSE
TELL ME YOUR NAME.

26:29.583 --> 26:32.250
DID IT OCCUR TO YOU
THAT MAYBE I'M JUST
NOT INTERESTED?

26:32.250 --> 26:39.208
OH, NO, ACTUALLY,
UM, BUT BLIND OPTIMISM
IS ONE OF MY FAULTS.

26:39.208 --> 26:41.250
ONE OF YOUR FAULTS?
DO YOU HAVE MANY?

26:42.291 --> 26:44.708
LET'S SEE, THERE'S, UM,

26:44.708 --> 26:47.208
MY RECKLESS DISREGARD
FOR DANGER,

26:47.208 --> 26:49.250
MY TIRESOME ROMANTICISM,

26:49.250 --> 26:50.750
AND THEN
THERE'S THE WAY
I KEEP ON TALKING

26:50.750 --> 26:53.875
LONG AFTER THE PERSON
I'M TRYING TO IMPRESS
HAS LOST ALL INTEREST.

26:53.875 --> 26:55.834
MY NAME IS NINA.
AND IF YOU ASK ME

26:55.834 --> 26:57.625
WHERE PINTA  AND
SANTA MARIA  ARE,

26:57.625 --> 26:59.417
I'LL BE
SO OUT OF HERE.

27:03.750 --> 27:05.917
FIND
SOMEONE SPECIAL?

27:05.917 --> 27:08.208
I DID. SHE DIDN'T.

27:11.625 --> 27:14.000
DAMN!
CHECK OUT DAWSON.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.667
THAT GIRL'S FINE.

27:17.083 --> 27:19.458
THERE'S LOT OF WOMEN
IN THIS PLACE. WHY ME?

27:19.458 --> 27:20.959
DID YOU NOTICE
MY INNER LIGHT

27:20.959 --> 27:23.333
OR WAS IT SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE BASE?

27:23.333 --> 27:25.625
UM, ACTUALLY,
IT WAS YOUR SHIRT.

27:25.625 --> 27:27.792
REALLY, THIS THING?

27:27.792 --> 27:30.625
AND NOT EVEN
ANY CLEAVAGE.

27:30.625 --> 27:33.500
SO WHAT ARE YOU, DAWSON,
SOME SORT OF FILM BUFF?

27:38.208 --> 27:40.208
[TAPPING ON WINDOW]

27:42.208 --> 27:42.792
UH, COME ON IN.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.375
HEY. HOW'S
MY FAVORITE
MOTHER-TO-BE?

27:53.375 --> 27:54.792
ACTUALLY, NOT SO GOOD.

27:54.792 --> 27:55.875
LOOK, I--I JUST CAME
OVER HERE TO TELL YOU

27:55.875 --> 27:58.417
THAT WE SHOULD
CALL THE WHOLE THING OFF.

27:58.417 --> 27:59.500
WH-WHY?

27:59.500 --> 28:00.667
BECAUSE IT'S TOO MUCH.

28:00.667 --> 28:02.834
I DON'T LIKE
TO BE IN THE MIDDLE
OF EVERYTHING.

28:02.834 --> 28:05.291
MRS. TINGLE WANTS ME
TO SIGN UP FOR THAT
MOMMY AND ME CLASS.

28:05.291 --> 28:07.834
YEAH, AND SHERMAN WILLIAMS,
THAT ADVENTIST KID,

28:07.834 --> 28:09.291
HE OFFERED
TO MARRY ME TODAY.

28:09.291 --> 28:11.834
IT'S NOTHING
COMPARED TO WHAT
THEY'RE DOING TO WARREN.

28:11.834 --> 28:14.834
OH, WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT

28:14.834 --> 28:18.000
THAT GUY DESERVES
EVERYTHING THAT'S
COMING TO HIM.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.375
MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW.

28:21.375 --> 28:25.000
JOEY--JOEY, THAT GUY
TREATED YOU WITH
NO RESPECT, ALL RIGHT?

28:25.000 --> 28:26.792
THAT HURTS. I KNOW.

28:28.583 --> 28:32.792
OH, SO THAT'S
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

28:32.792 --> 28:34.750
WHAT--WHAT
DO YOU MEAN?

28:34.750 --> 28:36.208
YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT ME.

28:36.208 --> 28:38.708
YOU'RE JUST LOOKING
FOR SOME CONVENIENT
REVENGE SCENARIO

28:38.708 --> 28:40.708
TO DUMP ALL YOUR
RESIDUAL MALE ANGER.

28:40.708 --> 28:42.375
IS THAT WHAT DAWSON
WAS FOR YOU?

28:42.375 --> 28:43.375
JUST SOME PATSY
TO TAKE THE FALL

28:43.375 --> 28:45.417
FOR ALL THE GUYS
WHO HAVE DONE YOU WRONG?

28:45.417 --> 28:47.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T, JOEY. ALL RIGHT?

28:47.000 --> 28:49.583
DON'T--DON'T TURN THIS
INTO A DAWSON THING.

28:49.583 --> 28:52.375
THE REAL QUESTION IS
WHY DID I LISTEN
TO YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE?

28:52.375 --> 28:55.333
DAWSON WAS PROBABLY
THE FIRST DECENT GUY
YOU EVER GONE OUT WITH,

28:55.333 --> 28:56.500
AND LOOK WHAT YOU DID.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.583
YOU DROVE HIM RIGHT INTO
THE ARMS OF A PROSTITUTE.

28:58.583 --> 29:00.000
JOEY, YOU TOOK THAT ONE
WAY TOO FAR.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.750
YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE TRUTH?

29:01.750 --> 29:04.542
YOU WANT--'CAUSE THE
TRUTH IS EVER SINCE
DAWSON AND I BROKE UP,

29:04.542 --> 29:05.708
YOU HAVE BEEN
SCARED TO DEATH.

29:05.708 --> 29:07.250
OH, PLEASE.

29:07.250 --> 29:08.708
YOU'RE SCARED
BECAUSE NOW THERE'S
NO MORE EXCUSES.

29:08.708 --> 29:10.417
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE
TO BLAME.

29:10.417 --> 29:14.917
AND NOW WHEN DAWSON
TREATS YOU LIKE GOOD OL'
UNDERSTANDING JOEY,

29:14.917 --> 29:16.500
JUST ONE
OF THE GUYS JOEY,

29:16.500 --> 29:17.750
I'M NOT GOING TO BE
AROUND FOR YOU TO HATE.

29:17.750 --> 29:20.166
AND THAT IS HOW
HE'LL TREAT YOU, JOEY.

29:33.375 --> 29:36.041
SCORCESE, KUBRICK.
THOSE ARE DIRECTORS.

29:36.041 --> 29:38.834
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE A SPIELBERG FAN.

29:38.834 --> 29:40.417
THE GUY MAKES
SLICK FAIRY TALES.

29:40.417 --> 29:42.417
MOVIES BY NATURE
ARE ESCAPIST.

29:42.417 --> 29:44.166
IF YOU WANT REALITY,
LOOK OUT THE WINDOW.

29:44.166 --> 29:45.458
UH, COME ON,
HE'S A SCHLOCKMEISTER.

29:45.458 --> 29:48.458
WHOSE MOVIES HAVE DONE
A BILLION DOLLARS
OF BOX OFFICE.

29:48.458 --> 29:53.667
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE EQUATING
MAINSTREAM POPULARITY
WITH ARTISTIC MERIT.

29:53.667 --> 29:57.750
BY THAT LOGIC, WE SHOULD
BE STUDYING ACE VENTURA
IN FILM SCHOOL.

29:57.750 --> 29:59.959
YOU'RE IN
FILM SCHOOL?

29:59.959 --> 30:02.583
HEY, DAWSON, THEY GOT,
UH, THAT CHOCOLATE MILK
YOU ORDERED

30:02.583 --> 30:04.250
UP AT THE BAR THERE.

30:06.291 --> 30:06.959
AND WHAT IS YOUR NAME,
BEAUTIFUL?

30:10.834 --> 30:11.959
NINA.

30:11.959 --> 30:15.208
YOU CAN CALL ME
COLUMBUS.

30:17.417 --> 30:20.375
YOU KNOW WHAT, DAWSON,
THIS PLACE IS GETTING
REALLY CROWDED.

30:20.375 --> 30:21.959
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GET OUT OF HERE?

30:21.959 --> 30:24.000
YEAH. LET'S.

30:26.625 --> 30:27.834
HEY!

30:35.000 --> 30:36.583
SO, THANK YOU BACK THERE.

30:36.583 --> 30:39.417
BILLY, I MEAN, HE CAN BE
SORT OF A JERK SOMETIMES.

30:39.417 --> 30:43.708
THINKS HE'S, YOU KNOW.
IT'S COLDER OUT HERE
THAN IT WAS BEFORE.

30:43.708 --> 30:45.583
I THINK A LITTLE
BIT CHILLY.

30:45.583 --> 30:46.917
HE'S FROM NEW YORK,
BILLY IS.

30:46.917 --> 30:49.458
SO HE'S THE ONE
WHO BROUGHT ME HERE.

30:49.458 --> 30:51.291
FILM SCHOOL, HUH?

30:51.291 --> 30:53.208
DAWSON, ARE WE DOING
SOMETHING YOU DON'T
WANT TO DO?

30:53.208 --> 30:55.208
NO.

30:55.208 --> 30:56.291
'CAUSE
YOU'VE LAUNCHED

30:56.291 --> 30:57.375
INTO A PRETTY
CONVINCING

30:58.834 --> 30:59.959
LOOK, ALL
WE'RE DOING IS
WALKING TO MY CAR.

31:03.208 --> 31:04.834
AND AFTER THAT?

31:04.834 --> 31:07.542
WELL, AFTER THAT,
I'M DRIVING HOME.

31:07.542 --> 31:09.917
NOTICE THE FIRST
PERSON SINGULAR.

31:09.917 --> 31:13.041
I'M NOT
IN THE HABIT OF BEING
THE SEXUAL FACILITATOR

31:13.041 --> 31:14.667
FOR MEN WITH
SOMETHING TO PROVE.

31:14.667 --> 31:16.250
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

31:16.250 --> 31:19.041
COME ON,
I SAW YOUR FRIENDS
OVER YOUR SHOULDER.

31:19.041 --> 31:21.125
THEY DID EVERYTHING
BUT HOLD UP SCORECARDS.

31:22.917 --> 31:25.750
MAYBE--MAYBE IT IS
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

31:28.375 --> 31:29.708
I JUST GOT DUMPED.

31:29.708 --> 31:33.458
AHH, THE EVENING
SNAPS INTO FOCUS.

31:33.458 --> 31:36.875
AND I LET THEM CONVINCE
ME THAT THE BEST WAY
TO GET OVER HER...

31:36.875 --> 31:38.458
WAS TO NAIL A STRANGER?

31:38.458 --> 31:41.291
YEAH, I GUESS, BUT--

31:41.291 --> 31:42.542
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
HEALTHY, YOU KNOW.

31:42.542 --> 31:45.417
I'M SORRY, BUT--BUT
IT DID QUIT BEING
ABOUT THAT.

31:45.417 --> 31:47.375
FOR NEARLY
AN HOUR IN THERE,
TALKING TO YOU.

31:47.375 --> 31:49.041
I FORGOT
ALL ABOUT IT.
ALL ABOUT HER.

31:49.041 --> 31:52.917
AND, HA, HA,
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN 3 DAYS,

31:52.917 --> 31:56.458
I ACTUALLY
DON'T FEEL SO BAD.

31:58.417 --> 32:05.291
SO, UM, WOULD IT IMPRESS
YOUR FRIENDS IF YOU DIDN'T,
UM, REAPPEAR TILL MORNING?

32:07.083 --> 32:09.542
I THINK THEY'D
ERECT A STATUE.

32:11.750 --> 32:14.917
OK, TELL YOU WHAT.
COME OVER.

32:14.917 --> 32:17.000
WE'LL FALL ASLEEP
WATCHING TV.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.417
I MEAN, YOU'RE
A SPIELBERG FAN.

32:18.417 --> 32:20.291
IT'S NOT LIKE I'D BE
IN ANY DANGER, RIGHT?

32:23.208 --> 32:25.208
HURRY UP. COME ON.
BEFORE I START LISTENING

32:25.208 --> 32:27.792
TO THAT LITTLE VOICE
IN MY HEAD TELLING ME
I SHOULD CARD YOU.

32:27.792 --> 32:31.917
THE GIRL THAT I
TOLD YOU ABOUT...

32:31.917 --> 32:34.917
I STILL SORT OF WANT
HER BACK AND I...

32:34.917 --> 32:37.291
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE
I'M JUST BEING
REALLY CRAZY HERE,

32:37.291 --> 32:38.875
BUT I...

32:38.875 --> 32:41.792
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT WOULD BE RIGHT.

32:41.792 --> 32:44.959
WOW! CAN'T DECIDE
IF I'M OFFENDED

32:44.959 --> 32:49.041
OR IF YOU'VE JUST RESTORED
MY FAITH IN THE MALE SEX.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.166

COME TO HER SENSES.

WELCOME TO CAPESIDE'S ANNUAL
COLLEGE FAIR THIS EVENING.

33:16.792 --> 33:18.750
PLEASE BE SURE TO CHECK OUT
OUR INTERNATIONAL BOOTH.

33:18.750 --> 33:20.250
THAT'S BOOTH 3.

LOOK LIKE WITH A BOWLING
BALL IN HER UTERUS?

33:28.625 --> 33:30.834
DON'T BOTHER.

33:30.834 --> 33:31.708
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I THOUGHT
THAT SHE WAS--

33:31.708 --> 33:34.333
NOT A CHANCE.

33:34.333 --> 33:36.917
THAT GIRL'S COMIC RELIEF.
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

33:36.917 --> 33:39.792
WARREN GARY WAS CALLED
INTO THE NURSE'S OFFICE
THIS AFTERNOON

33:39.792 --> 33:41.375
FOR A LECTURE
ON CONTRACEPTION.

33:41.375 --> 33:43.166
WELL, GOOD.
HE COULD USE--

33:43.166 --> 33:44.333
YOU DON'T GET IT.

33:44.333 --> 33:46.834
WARREN IS THE LAST PERSON
WHO NEEDS THAT LECTURE.

33:46.834 --> 33:49.166
WHAT YOU HEARD WAS
A LIE MADE UP BY
A PATHETIC SOPHOMORE

33:49.166 --> 33:52.333
TRYING TO LAND
A POPULAR BOYFRIEND.

33:52.333 --> 33:54.250
BESIDES, WARREN COULDN'T
FERTILIZE A GARDEN.

33:56.500 --> 33:57.750
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

33:57.750 --> 34:00.000
I HAD A CHAT WITH
MY FRIEND ELISE TODAY.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.208
SHE USED TO DATE WARREN.

34:01.208 --> 34:03.291
SHE DATED HIM FOR 6 MONTHS.

34:03.291 --> 34:06.125
SHE USED TO BAKE HIM
SPIRIT COOKIES
BEFORE EVERY GAME.

34:06.125 --> 34:08.708
SHE BOUGHT A $400 DRESS
FOR A DANCE HE FAILED
TO SHOW UP FOR.

34:08.708 --> 34:10.833
OK, YOUR POINT IS?

34:10.833 --> 34:12.417
ACCORDING TO ELISE,

34:12.417 --> 34:16.083
WARREN HAD ONE OTHER
SIGNIFICANT FAILURE
AS A BOYFRIEND.

34:16.083 --> 34:19.166
LET'S JUST SAY HE HAD
A SOFT SPOT FOR THE LADIES

34:19.166 --> 34:21.417
IN A VERY UNFORTUNATE
LOCATION.

34:35.208 --> 34:38.208
[WHISPERING]

34:54.583 --> 34:57.083
HEY, MAN.

34:57.083 --> 34:59.166
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING BACK HERE?

34:59.166 --> 35:02.458
GOD! YOU COULDN'T
PULL THE TRIGGER.

35:02.458 --> 35:03.667
GUESS NOT, BILLY.

35:03.667 --> 35:05.667
MAN, YOU PRACTICALLY
HAD HER BEGGING FOR IT.

35:05.667 --> 35:07.667
LISTEN, A LITTLE
PIECE OF ADVICE--

35:07.667 --> 35:09.583
FOR FUTURE REFERENCE,
GETTING LAID,

35:09.583 --> 35:12.917
IT COMES DOWN TO
A SIMPLE BEATLES/
STONES QUESTION.

35:12.917 --> 35:13.917
WHAT?

35:13.917 --> 35:15.250
DO YOU WANT
TO HOLD HER HAND

35:15.250 --> 35:17.333
OR DO YOU
WANT TO SPEND
THE NIGHT TOGETHER?

35:17.333 --> 35:19.375
SOME WOMEN MIGHT
SAY THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR A BEATLE,

35:19.375 --> 35:21.208
TRUST ME,
THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING

35:21.208 --> 35:23.125
A LITTLE MORE...
TANGIBLE.

35:23.125 --> 35:24.375
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.
I'LL KEEP THAT
IN MIND, BILLY.

35:27.667 --> 35:29.417
HEY, KNOW WHAT,
GUYS? MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST GET OUT OF HERE.

35:29.417 --> 35:33.792
IT'S FUNNY, UH,
WATCHING YOU
WITH THIS GIRL.

35:33.792 --> 35:34.917
IT SORT OF
MAKES SENSE WHY YOU
BLEW IT WITH JEN.

35:34.917 --> 35:37.417
I DON'T GET YOU!

35:37.417 --> 35:40.000
YOU CAME TO TOWN
TO BREAK JEN AND ME UP.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.708
ARE YOU POUTING NOW
BECAUSE THINGS DIDN'T GO
ACCORDING TO PLAN?

35:42.708 --> 35:44.125
WHAT?

35:44.125 --> 35:45.208
YOU THINK
I DON'T KNOW WHY

35:45.208 --> 35:47.166
YOU WANTED ME
TO GET LUCKY TONIGHT?

35:47.166 --> 35:48.083
SO YOU COULD GO
WHISPER IN JEN'S EAR,

35:48.083 --> 35:50.458
CONVINCE HER
THAT ALL MEN ARE DOGS,

35:50.458 --> 35:52.166
THEN ASSUME THAT
SHE'D SEEK YOUR COMFORT.

35:52.166 --> 35:55.375
FOR ALL THAT WISDOM,
YOU SURE BIT HARD.

35:55.375 --> 35:57.125
HARD ENOUGH TO KNOW
THAT IT'S NOT MY STYLE,
MAN, IT'S YOURS.

35:57.125 --> 36:01.250
AND FRANKLY,
YOUR STYLE'S PATHETIC.

36:01.250 --> 36:03.125
IF YOU REALLY HAD JEN'S
BEST INTERESTS AT HEART,

36:03.125 --> 36:04.625
YOU WOULD STAY AWAY
FROM HER.

36:04.625 --> 36:07.375
DO YOU KNOW THOSE
ARE THE EXACT SAME
WORDS HER DAD USED

36:07.375 --> 36:09.500
WHEN HE TOLD ME
HE'D SEND HER AWAY?

36:09.500 --> 36:11.667
DO YOU THINK IT'S
FUNNY YOU SOUND LIKE
HER DAD? I DO.

36:11.667 --> 36:15.250
IT'S BETTER THAN SOUNDING
LIKE HER LOSER EX-BOYFRIEND.

36:15.250 --> 36:17.166
WELL, I'M
SORRY YOU FEEL
THAT WAY, DAWSON.

36:17.166 --> 36:20.500
AND, UH, SINCE
YOU 2 COOL GUYS

36:20.500 --> 36:21.917
PROBABLY WOULDN'T
WANT A LOSER LIKE ME
HANGING AROUND,

36:21.917 --> 36:24.708
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

36:24.708 --> 36:26.917
HAVE A FUN TRIP
HOME, BOYS.

36:29.834 --> 36:32.792
YOU THINK YOU COULD
HAVE MAYBE WAITED TILL
WE WERE BACK IN CAPESIDE

36:32.792 --> 36:35.125
TO THROW OUT THAT
LAST ZINGER, DAWSON?

36:40.708 --> 36:42.834
HEY, LOVERBOY.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.250
SPARE A MINUTE?

36:46.667 --> 36:48.583
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN
A REALLY LONG DAY.

36:48.583 --> 36:49.667
OH, MY HEART BLEEDS.

36:49.667 --> 36:55.208
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
TOO THRILLED WITH ME,

36:55.208 --> 36:58.875
BUT HERE'S AN IDEA.

36:58.875 --> 37:01.041
ONE WAY TO GET RID
OF A LIE IS TO
MAKE IT THE TRUTH.

37:01.041 --> 37:02.500
SO MAYBE YOU AND ME--

37:02.500 --> 37:05.375
YOU KNOW, I'M AFRAID
I'D BE GETTING
WORKED UP

37:05.375 --> 37:07.375
FOR SOMETHING THAT
I HEAR IS QUITE
THE ANTI-CLIMAX, SO.

37:10.083 --> 37:11.291
WHAT?

37:12.250 --> 37:14.125
YOUR REVIEWS ARE IN,
WARREN.

37:14.125 --> 37:17.041
AND FRANKLY,
YOU'VE BEEN PANNED.

37:17.041 --> 37:18.875
SO WHAT IS THIS,
SOME KIND OF
SOPHOMORE THREAT?

37:18.875 --> 37:22.417
NO. JUST A REMINDER.

37:22.417 --> 37:24.750
THAT IF ONE PERSON
SAYS SOMETHING,
IT'S A RUMOR.

37:24.750 --> 37:28.542
BUT 2 PEOPLE. MMM.
IT'S GOSPEL.

37:28.542 --> 37:32.208
BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY
NOT PLANNING ON DATING
ANYONE EVER AGAIN, SO.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.208
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

37:34.208 --> 37:36.792
COMPLETE AND
UTTER DENIAL.

37:36.792 --> 37:39.542
FINE! JUST
SO YOU KNOW...

37:39.542 --> 37:43.542
THE REASON I PICKED YOU UP
THIS MORNING WAS BECAUSE--

37:47.000 --> 37:47.417
I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE NICE.

37:49.625 --> 37:52.083
YOU KNOW, JUST--

37:52.083 --> 37:55.708
SATURDAY NIGHT I HAVE PLANS,
BUT THEY'RE BREAKABLE.

37:55.708 --> 37:58.291
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

37:58.291 --> 38:03.208
IN PUBLIC...OFFICIAL...

38:03.208 --> 38:05.625
GROPING-OPTIONAL DATE.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.417
YEAH.

38:08.417 --> 38:13.083
SURE, UM, YEAH,
JUST, UH, PICK ME UP
AFTER MY LOBOTOMY.

38:17.792 --> 38:19.583
[THUNDER RUMBLES]

38:21.625 --> 38:25.458
SO, YOU WANTED
TO GET OUT OF CAPESIDE
TO GET JEN OFF YOUR MIND.

38:25.458 --> 38:26.834
DID IT WORK?

38:26.834 --> 38:30.333
NO. [CHUCKLES]

38:30.333 --> 38:31.583
MAYBE FOR AWHILE.

38:37.125 --> 38:38.959
ALL RIGHT, AM I GOING
TO HAVE TO WAIT ALL NIGHT,

38:38.959 --> 38:41.917
OR YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED OUTSIDE
THE CLUB WITH THAT WOMAN?

38:41.917 --> 38:44.000
[SIGHS]

38:44.000 --> 38:46.166
NOTHING HAPPENED.
I JUST WALKED HER
TO HER CAR.

38:46.166 --> 38:49.417
THAT'S IT. NOTHING
HAPPENED AT ALL.

38:49.417 --> 38:51.917
RIGHT. ABSOLUTELY.
SO YOU'RE JUST
WEARING THAT LIPSTICK

38:51.917 --> 38:54.041
AS A FASHION STATEMENT,
RIGHT?

38:57.208 --> 38:59.708
HA HA HA HA!

39:07.875 --> 39:09.375
HEY.

39:09.375 --> 39:11.333
HEY.

39:16.917 --> 39:20.500
LOOK, I'M--I'M
HAVING AN ICE CREAM
ANTI-SOCIAL HERE.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.917
YOU WANT TO JOIN ME?

39:24.166 --> 39:27.333
YEAH, YEAH, SURE.

39:32.875 --> 39:36.291
THE WARREN GARY
INFORMATION PROVED
USEFUL. THANKS.

39:36.291 --> 39:41.250
OH, RUMOR HAS IT THAT
HIS PUBLIC RETRACTION IS
ALREADY MAKING THE ROUNDS.

39:41.250 --> 39:45.667
WELL, IT IS NEWS AND
THIS IS HIGH SCHOOL.

39:45.667 --> 39:46.875
MMM, COOKIE DOUGH.

39:46.875 --> 39:49.291
YEAH.

39:54.750 --> 39:58.708
SO--SO WHAT
DO YOU THINK, JOEY?

39:58.708 --> 40:02.166
IS THERE ANY WAY
WE CAN KEEP DAWSON
FROM COMING BETWEEN US?

40:05.625 --> 40:06.667
YEAH, SURE, I MEAN--

40:09.125 --> 40:12.750
HE'S--HE'S ONLY IN LOVE
WITH ONE OF US, SO.

40:12.750 --> 40:14.000
YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:20.041 --> 40:25.208
MUST BE, OH, A LOT EASIER
THAN JUST BEING THE OBJECT
OF HIS INFATUATION, HUH?

40:33.083 --> 40:35.417
ALTHOUGH, I DOUBT
THAT AFTER TODAY

40:35.417 --> 40:38.583
EITHER OF US WILL BE
VYING FOR HIS AFFECTIONS.

40:40.125 --> 40:42.000
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

40:42.000 --> 40:48.667
I MEAN, JUST
PICTURING DAWSON SO...
MALE, IT'S JUST--

40:48.667 --> 40:50.792
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S MADE
ME NAUSEOUS ALL DAY.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.917
YOU THINK HE'S ALREADY--

41:10.792 --> 41:13.792
[SIGHS]

41:30.959 --> 41:34.667
SO, DID YOU GET EVERYTHING
YOU WENT THERE FOR?

41:34.667 --> 41:37.959
I WAS A NON-STOP
SEX MACHINE, JOEY.

41:37.959 --> 41:40.125
YOU KNOW ME.

41:40.125 --> 41:41.959
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

41:41.959 --> 41:44.166
AH. I BOFFED CAPESIDE'S
STARTING FULLBACK

41:44.166 --> 41:45.291
AND GOT KNOCKED UP,
YOU KNOW.

41:45.291 --> 41:48.375
OH, THAT'S NICE.

41:51.166 --> 41:54.708
SO WAS IT ALL GOOD
CLEAN FUN, DAWSON?

41:54.708 --> 41:55.750
UM, NOT EXACTLY.

42:01.708 --> 42:03.542
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

42:03.542 --> 42:08.000
I WILL. OH, JOEY,
THERE'S SO MUCH THAT
I WANT TO TELL YOU,

42:08.000 --> 42:12.125
BUT I AM SO TIRED
RIGHT NOW. I HAVEN'T
SLEPT IN 24 HOURS.

42:12.125 --> 42:14.542
[YAWNING] PLUS...

42:14.542 --> 42:18.333
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN WAIT.

42:18.333 --> 42:19.041
IT'S OK.

42:19.041 --> 42:21.917
OK. HEY!

42:23.959 --> 42:25.500
FOR AWHILE TONIGHT,

42:25.500 --> 42:28.000
NOTHING REMINDED ME
OF JEN.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.083
IT WAS LIKE
LOOKING AT THE WORLD
WITHOUT BLINDERS ON.

42:53.041 --> 42:55.583
YEAH.

42:56.208 --> 42:57.792
I CAN WAIT.
