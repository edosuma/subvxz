WEBVTT

00:00.391 --> 00:03.769
Raising the age of retirement is
an unacceptable erosion

00:03.770 --> 00:05.647
of the American dream.

00:05.648 --> 00:08.881
If the Republicans fail to pass
a reasonable omnibus package

00:08.983 --> 00:11.401
by demanding entitlement reform,

00:11.402 --> 00:14.239
they will force the federal government
into a spending freeze.

00:14.240 --> 00:18.494
The frostbite will be
on their hands, not ours.

00:18.495 --> 00:20.913
Do you think that's a bit much?
The frostbite bit?

00:20.914 --> 00:24.042
It's the State of the Union.
We want to appeal to fly-over states.

00:24.043 --> 00:26.879
- They'll like that line.
- I want something more forceful.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.923
- "Blood on their hands"?
- No.

00:28.924 --> 00:31.718
- "Throw us back into the ice age."
- Oh, I like that, Christina.

00:31.719 --> 00:35.850
Let's try that. Linda.
Christina, you come up here too.

00:45.570 --> 00:49.824
There are two types of vice presidents:
doormats and matadors.

00:49.825 --> 00:53.621
Which do you think
I intend to be?

00:53.622 --> 00:55.125
Raymond.

00:58.169 --> 01:02.966
He's hung up on the domestic agenda.
Not a single word about China.

01:02.967 --> 01:06.511
His instincts are right. If the government
shuts down one day after the speech,

01:06.512 --> 01:09.766
not a single word in the speech matters.
We have to address the freeze now.

01:09.767 --> 01:13.313
- China comes later.
- Both parties have been wrangling

01:13.314 --> 01:15.732
over entitlements for months.
What makes you think

01:15.733 --> 01:18.861
a miracle's gonna happen
in the next three days?

01:18.862 --> 01:23.408
We give the Republicans
exactly what they want.

01:23.409 --> 01:25.453
- Retirement age?
- Yes.

01:25.454 --> 01:29.124
That's a line in
the sand we cannot cross.

01:29.125 --> 01:32.419
We will cross it, eventually.
So why keep fighting it?

01:32.420 --> 01:36.675
I can push this through the Senate,
and once I do, the president will announce

01:36.676 --> 01:40.347
a major bipartisan agreement
in the State of the Union.

01:40.348 --> 01:43.850
We avoid a government shutdown
and the White House gets credit.

01:43.851 --> 01:47.981
It's a huge risk, and if it fails,
a huge embarrassment.

01:47.982 --> 01:51.567
The embarrassment will be
entirely my own. This is on my shoulders.

01:51.568 --> 01:56.615
Even so, the president is
gonna require some serious persuasion.

01:56.616 --> 02:00.162
- I'm happy to talk to him.
- No.

02:00.163 --> 02:03.834
No... I'll do it.

02:03.835 --> 02:07.547
He'll be more amenable
if it comes from a friend.

02:07.548 --> 02:10.384
You're right.
A trusted confidant.

02:10.386 --> 02:12.804
Let me test the waters.

02:14.890 --> 02:18.894
The Cult of Tusk.
one.

02:18.895 --> 02:21.356
But that one disciple
just so happens to be

02:21.357 --> 02:26.071
the most powerful man
in the free world. For now.

02:29.226 --> 04:04.182
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

04:04.777 --> 04:08.239
Entitlements. Raising
the age of eligibility to 67.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.740
Your people will
never go for it.

04:09.741 --> 04:11.243
They will if the
leadership does,

04:11.244 --> 04:12.786
and the leadership will.

04:12.787 --> 04:14.788
They've fought us on this
since I was in diapers.

04:14.789 --> 04:17.959
Assuming that I can get this past
my people and convince them,

04:17.961 --> 04:21.130
- can you convince yours?
- It's a tough sell.

04:21.132 --> 04:25.469
You're the Senate majority leader, Hector.
You don't have to sell, you can dictate.

04:25.470 --> 04:27.763
- What do you want in return?
- A working government.

04:27.764 --> 04:30.225
- We stave off the freeze.
- You won on education,

04:30.226 --> 04:32.311
we confirmed you
as vice president.

04:32.312 --> 04:34.980
- The Republicans need a win, Frank.
- And that's what I'm offering.

04:34.981 --> 04:37.484
You get a win on entitlements,
we avoid a shutdown.

04:37.485 --> 04:40.821
Everyone gets points
for bipartisanship.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.909
- You know who I'm worried about?
- Curtis Haas.

04:43.910 --> 04:47.163
- He's a troublemaker, Frank.
- Who controls a third of your caucus.

04:47.164 --> 04:50.292
And he'll never go for this.
He wants to see the Democrats suffer.

04:50.293 --> 04:54.298
Just bring him to the table.
That's all I'm asking.

05:02.517 --> 05:05.061
Miss Gallagher?
My name is Lucas Goodwin,

05:05.062 --> 05:07.105
I'm a deputy editor
of the <i> Washington Herald.</i>

05:07.106 --> 05:08.940
- Mr. Goodwin, please.
- Just a few moments,

05:08.941 --> 05:11.402
- that's all I'm asking.
- If I wanted to talk to you,

05:11.403 --> 05:13.488
- I would've returned your calls.
- Did you read my e-mails?

05:13.489 --> 05:15.240
Yes. Which is
why I didn't call.

05:15.241 --> 05:16.742
Give me a chance
to walk you through it.

05:16.743 --> 05:18.369
I have to get back
to the White House.

05:18.370 --> 05:19.954
- Peter Russo was killed.
- Let go.

05:19.955 --> 05:21.831
So was Zoe Barnes.
I was working with her.

05:21.832 --> 05:23.625
- Stop and listen.
- Frank Underwood is the one who did this.

05:23.627 --> 05:26.129
Listen! This is nuts.

05:26.130 --> 05:29.006
- The DUI, the brachiums. All of it...
- This has to stop. OK?

05:29.007 --> 05:31.342
Underwood talk to you?
Tell you not to speak with anybody?

05:31.343 --> 05:32.470
- No.
- Doug Stamper?

05:32.471 --> 05:33.930
Whatever you think happened,

05:33.931 --> 05:35.890
whatever compelled you
to stalk me like this...

05:35.891 --> 05:37.518
You're the only person
who might know something,

05:37.519 --> 05:38.769
who could understand.

05:38.770 --> 05:40.647
I've got no one else
I can talk...

05:40.648 --> 05:43.984
I don't understand.
And I don't want to. OK?

05:43.985 --> 05:46.487
- There's no story here.
- Please, five minutes.

05:46.488 --> 05:48.323
Think about what you're doing.
Waiting outside...

05:48.324 --> 05:50.952
Peter would be alive if it
wasn't for Frank Underwood.

05:52.870 --> 05:56.124
I've worked really hard
to put Peter behind me.

05:56.126 --> 06:00.505
So if I see you again,
if I hear from you again,
I'll not only contact the police,

06:00.506 --> 06:02.633
I'll let the vice president
know what you're saying,

06:02.634 --> 06:05.721
and then you can deal
with the Secret Service, too.

06:07.264 --> 06:09.056
It's the usual overseas chatter.

06:09.057 --> 06:10.726
A bit of a bump in China,

06:10.727 --> 06:13.021
but we chalk that up
to the trade tensions.

06:13.022 --> 06:15.649
- Secret Service?
- Average number of death threats

06:15.650 --> 06:17.359
to both POTUS and the VP.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.821
We passed them along
to our dear friends at the FBI.

06:19.822 --> 06:22.366
FBI?

06:22.367 --> 06:24.117
The FBI confirms the level

06:24.118 --> 06:27.121
of activity of our dear friends
at the Secret Service.

06:27.122 --> 06:30.292
We've followed up on everything.
No high-level threats.

06:30.293 --> 06:33.546
So nothing we need to report directly
to the president or vice president?

06:33.547 --> 06:35.924
- No.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

06:39.095 --> 06:41.681
The e-mail you sent,
has anyone else seen it?

06:41.683 --> 06:43.933
Except for the agent
that alerted me, no.

06:43.934 --> 06:46.563
Other agencies might
have stumbled upon this.

06:46.564 --> 06:48.147
Even so, they
probably ignored it.

06:48.148 --> 06:50.234
Any idea who's making the posts?

06:50.235 --> 06:52.862
Deep Web forums. Almost impossible
to trace. Lone wolf, most likely.

06:52.863 --> 06:57.033
- I want you to find him.
- We need a direct threat to life.

06:57.034 --> 06:59.119
The vice president
just assumed office.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.956
I can't have this conspiracy
stuff going mainstream.

07:01.957 --> 07:05.211
- This sort of thing usually fizzles out.
- I can't take the chance.

07:05.212 --> 07:07.672
I want you to find him
and put him away.

07:07.673 --> 07:11.260
- He hasn't committed a crime.
- But he wants to.

07:11.261 --> 07:14.346
- So help him.
- That requires manpower.

07:14.347 --> 07:18.143
- You've got men.
- It exposes me, Doug.

07:18.144 --> 07:21.940
I've always kept you informed
because you're an old pal and I trust you.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.610
But...

07:26.154 --> 07:28.030
We're talking
about an operation.

07:28.031 --> 07:31.829
I'm an old pal who now works
at the White House.

07:33.748 --> 07:36.165
Between old pals,

07:36.166 --> 07:40.298
I've been stuck at the
executive liaison for way too long.

07:42.676 --> 07:45.177
How worried are you that a mass
shooting could happen in a school

07:45.178 --> 07:50.559
in your community? Great deal,
somewhat, not so much, not at all, unsure.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.395
<i>You sound hot. Are you hot?</i>

07:53.396 --> 07:57.152
- Sir...
- <i> Somewhat hot, a great deal hot?</i>

08:37.451 --> 08:40.746
<i>Lynchburg Children's,</i>
<i>Pediatric Division.</i>

08:40.746 --> 08:43.501
Can I talk to Cheryl Posner?

08:43.501 --> 08:46.004
<i>Sorry,</i> <i>she's on duty right now.</i>

08:46.005 --> 08:49.551
- It's her daughter.
- <i> Hold on one moment.</i>

08:58.354 --> 09:01.188
<i>Rachel? Rachel?</i>

09:01.189 --> 09:04.528
<i>Sweetheart, are you there?</i>
<i>Please don't...</i>

09:09.701 --> 09:12.370
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi, Mr. Jay, my name is Rachel

09:12.371 --> 09:15.416
and I'm calling on behalf
of the National Firearm Education Center.

09:15.417 --> 09:18.502
Would you be able to speak with
me briefly regarding firearm legislation

09:18.503 --> 09:20.629
and Second Amendment protection?

09:20.630 --> 09:23.968
So you're Willa's top choice.

09:23.969 --> 09:26.930
Why should you be my
husband's and my top choice?

09:26.931 --> 09:30.392
Over the past ten years, the two
of you combined have gotten less coverage

09:30.393 --> 09:32.644
than the average junior
congressman from Nebraska.

09:32.645 --> 09:35.983
- Well, we don't seek the spotlight.
- I'm not suggesting you should.

09:35.984 --> 09:40.948
But am I correct in assuming that your
husband will be an active vice president?

09:40.949 --> 09:43.618
Well, it's harder to keep
an active VP out of the press than in it,

09:43.619 --> 09:47.413
but it's possible if we give the media
just enough to keep them from starving.

09:47.414 --> 09:51.878
- Where'd you grow up, Connor?
- Texas. Just like you.

09:51.879 --> 09:54.213
- Dallas?
- Lubbock.

09:54.214 --> 09:57.259
I had a much thicker accent
to get rid of than y'all.

09:57.260 --> 09:59.763
- How do you know I had one?
- Your first joint interview,

09:59.764 --> 10:01.975
when your husband was running
for state Assembly in '86.

10:04.311 --> 10:08.398
- That's on the Internet?
- No. No, I contacted the
local affiliate in Greenville.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.318
They wouldn't send me
the tapes via mail,

10:10.319 --> 10:12.112
so I went down there
and watched in their vault.

10:12.113 --> 10:13.738
To South Carolina?

10:13.739 --> 10:17.577
When I want a job,
I do my homework.

10:20.163 --> 10:22.206
I look forward to seeing
what you come up with.

10:22.208 --> 10:23.794
Thank you, Mrs. Underwood.

10:27.172 --> 10:28.800
Thursday.

10:41.231 --> 10:43.526
I don't see how this
is a victory for us.

10:43.527 --> 10:46.612
Our choices are the freeze,
which the Democrats get blamed for, or...

10:46.613 --> 10:49.783
- Not necessarily, the Republi...
- Which we definitely get blamed for.

10:49.784 --> 10:52.578
- Or we offer them...
- Entitlements, Frank?

10:52.579 --> 10:54.413
We took a stand.
We can't turn back now.

10:54.415 --> 10:56.207
I'd rather see the
government grind to a halt.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.712
Think of the headline:
"Democratic Leadership

10:58.713 --> 11:01.255
Enacts Entitlement Reform,
Staves Off Freeze."

11:01.256 --> 11:03.925
We show unity.
We offer progress.

11:03.926 --> 11:07.639
Let's convert some
lifelong conservatives.

11:09.433 --> 11:11.310
You have Mendoza's assurance
he'll work with us?

11:11.311 --> 11:15.149
- I do.
- I don't want to put our necks out there

11:15.150 --> 11:16.984
just to have the
guillotine fall.

11:16.985 --> 11:20.405
You won't. My neck will be right
out there with you.

11:20.406 --> 11:25.704
Francis faints at the sight of blood.
He'd never let them break the skin.

11:25.705 --> 11:27.414
To unity.

11:47.648 --> 11:50.611
No, no, no, no, no, no. Come on.

11:59.247 --> 12:04.253
Larry, can you come by? Something weird's
going on with my computer. Thanks.

12:18.813 --> 12:19.939
Come on!

12:25.238 --> 12:29.283
- Hey, what's the problem?
- Nothing. It's fine. I fixed it.

12:29.284 --> 12:32.163
- OK. Cool.
- Yeah.

12:50.350 --> 12:53.188
- It's not as progressive as I'd like.
- You mean radical.

12:53.189 --> 12:57.943
Raising retirement age to
67 makes entitlements solvent until 2055.

12:57.944 --> 13:03.450
And it saves us over a trillion dollars
without a single penny of taxpayer income.

13:03.451 --> 13:05.536
Sixty-eight would give us
another 300 billion,

13:05.537 --> 13:07.246
and I'd like to
eliminate early retirement.

13:07.247 --> 13:08.915
- Entirely?
- Forget it.

13:08.916 --> 13:12.170
What about... 68 and 64?

13:12.171 --> 13:14.589
I have a responsibility
to my constituents.

13:14.590 --> 13:17.177
- I promised I wouldn't waver...
- Are we really going to allow

13:17.178 --> 13:19.386
the tea party to determine
fiscal legislation?

13:19.387 --> 13:22.058
- Never been beholden to the tea party.
- Come on. You wouldn't have won

13:22.059 --> 13:24.977
reelection if their PACs hadn't dumped
ten million into your campaign.

13:24.978 --> 13:27.939
If their definition of budgetary
conservatism happens to overlap with mine,

13:27.940 --> 13:31.110
- that's a function of...
- Curtis, let's show some goodwill.

13:31.111 --> 13:34.404
- Can you stomach 68 and 64?
- Effective immediately?

13:34.405 --> 13:36.700
- Five years from now.
- Not interested.

13:36.701 --> 13:39.204
We can't throw this on people
without any warning.

13:39.205 --> 13:42.875
- They need some time to digest.
- I'm sorry, I just can't do it.

13:45.295 --> 13:48.382
OK, meet with your staff,
consult with your colleagues,

13:48.383 --> 13:50.218
I'll consult with mine
and let's talk tomorrow.

13:50.219 --> 13:54.139
- All right. I can agree to that.
- But this is a good first step.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.444
How do we make sure Curtis
can't filibuster

14:06.445 --> 14:08.740
- when we get the amendment passed?
- Assuming we do.

14:08.741 --> 14:10.784
Between you and me,
I'm sure we can turn him around.

14:10.785 --> 14:12.079
I just want to be
on the safe side.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.081
Make sure the
passage of the amendment

14:14.082 --> 14:17.000
- constitutes the passage of the bill.
- By previous agreement.

14:17.001 --> 14:19.211
We pass the amendment,
then we're done. Wham-bam.

14:19.213 --> 14:21.715
- Can we put that in writing?
- Have Erikson reach out to me.

14:21.716 --> 14:23.343
"Muchas gracias."

14:46.956 --> 14:48.791
Lucas Goodwin?

15:29.801 --> 15:31.970
<i>Good evening, Lucas.</i>

15:35.351 --> 15:38.728
<i>Speak into the microphone.</i>

15:38.729 --> 15:41.648
- Who are you?
- <i> Go to the home screen.</i>

15:41.649 --> 15:44.902
<i>- Open the other app.</i>
- Tell me who you are.

15:44.903 --> 15:48.824
<i>You've done your research.</i>
<i>You know who I am.</i>

15:48.825 --> 15:51.160
Well, I know
who you claim to be.

15:51.161 --> 15:55.249
<i>If you're not</i>
<i>convinced by now, goodbye.</i>

15:55.250 --> 16:00.463
Wait a minute. Uh...

16:00.464 --> 16:03.885
- All right, I'm on the home screen.
- <i> Open the notary app.</i>

16:06.972 --> 16:08.348
What is this?

16:08.349 --> 16:10.517
<i>To ensure you</i>
<i>aren't law enforcement.</i>

16:10.518 --> 16:14.064
- I'm not.
- <i> Then sign.</i>

16:14.065 --> 16:18.446
- How? <i>- Hold your thumb to
the camera and press "capture."</i>

16:20.072 --> 16:22.324
How do I know you're
not law enforcement?

16:22.325 --> 16:25.162
<i>Sign the document or walk away.</i>

16:29.167 --> 16:32.129
All right. I did it.

16:32.130 --> 16:36.175
<i>- Press "send."</i>
- Where is this going?

16:36.176 --> 16:42.309
<i>I'm VPNing through Iran and 12 other
countries, don't worry. It's secure.</i>

16:44.353 --> 16:47.230
<i>Now, one last thing.</i>

16:47.231 --> 16:52.112
<i>I need the two-step verification code
for the</i> Herald's <i> internal servers.</i>

16:54.073 --> 16:56.699
- I don't even know
how to do that.

16:56.700 --> 16:59.997
- <i> Yes, you do. Check your</i>
<i>e-mail.</i>

17:06.339 --> 17:09.550
<i>Destroy the iPad,</i>
<i>especially the serial number,</i>

17:09.550 --> 17:13.054
<i>and delete the e-mail</i>
<i>after you've memorized it.</i>

17:13.055 --> 17:14.973
<i>Good luck.</i>

17:21.607 --> 17:23.484
<i>Hello?</i>

17:23.486 --> 17:25.488
Raymond, are you there?

17:26.989 --> 17:31.160
Yeah, uh, sorry, Frank, I...

17:31.161 --> 17:32.911
I thought I saw an Inca dove.

17:32.912 --> 17:35.123
<i>It must have flown</i>
<i>the wrong direction for winter.</i>

17:35.124 --> 17:38.545
- It sounds windy. Where are you?
- <i> Top of my building.</i>

17:38.546 --> 17:41.715
<i>Got a bird feeder up here.</i>

17:41.716 --> 17:45.052
Nice work with the president.
I hear we have a green light.

17:45.053 --> 17:50.394
He pushed back in the beginning but, yeah,
his writers are reworking the speech now.

17:50.395 --> 17:54.399
I'm very close to a deal.
Sixty-eight, 64 in five years.

17:54.400 --> 17:58.319
- Spending cuts as discussed.
- That rock solid?

17:58.320 --> 18:01.907
<i>- Soon as we shake hands.</i>
- What's the holdup?

18:01.908 --> 18:05.119
Curtis Haas, which isn't a surprise.
I'm meeting with him soon.

18:05.120 --> 18:08.290
- He's the final hurdle.
- <i> Cutting it pretty close, Frank.</i>

18:08.291 --> 18:11.002
Well, this is...
this is historic.

18:11.003 --> 18:14.797
The Republicans have wanted
entitlement reform since Johnson.

18:14.798 --> 18:17.968
Curtis will come around. In the meantime,
we should get the new retirement ages

18:17.969 --> 18:22.349
<i>- into his speech.</i>
- I would stay away from specifics.

18:22.350 --> 18:25.770
- I mean, even if it passes, the House...
- I know the House

18:25.771 --> 18:30.317
better than you know birds. Believe me
when I say they'll pass the Senate version.

18:30.318 --> 18:34.322
I'll talk to the president.

18:34.323 --> 18:37.869
<i>- Just make sure this is airtight.</i>
- Thank you. What is it?

18:37.870 --> 18:41.123
- Lucas Goodwin.
- From the <i> Herald?</i>

18:41.124 --> 18:43.042
He must have been
working with Zoe.

18:43.043 --> 18:45.712
- How much does he know?
- No more than she did.

18:45.713 --> 18:48.215
- She knew enough.
- I'm on it, sir.

18:48.216 --> 18:50.384
- Proof?
- Not yet.

18:50.385 --> 18:54.348
- Jesus, Doug. - It's under control.
I thought you should be aware.

18:54.349 --> 18:56.809
I'm juggling the president,
the Republicans, Tusk. I can't...

18:56.810 --> 19:02.192
And you should stay focused
on that. Goodwin's on my plate, not yours.

19:04.319 --> 19:06.489
It wasn't until the 20th century

19:06.490 --> 19:10.201
that the notion of noble objectivism
came into the forefront.

19:10.202 --> 19:14.038
- But facts are facts.
- Nineteen ninety-two.

19:14.039 --> 19:17.960
George Bush Sr. is shown asking how
a grocery scanner works,

19:17.961 --> 19:22.924
and he gets nailed for it.
they were showing him a new model.

19:22.925 --> 19:26.514
He was asking how the new one
was different than the old one.

19:26.515 --> 19:29.266
Curiosity, not ignorance.

19:29.267 --> 19:33.355
But the lack of context
told a more powerful narrative.

19:33.356 --> 19:37.360
There is no arrangement of facts

19:37.361 --> 19:39.613
that is purely objective.

19:39.614 --> 19:42.116
We can finally do something.
We have the means to act.

19:42.117 --> 19:44.035
Some teenage,
pimple-faced hacker...

19:44.036 --> 19:45.870
This was a
sophisticated infiltration.

19:45.871 --> 19:50.209
It's not the work of a child.
Look, here's the e-mail.

19:50.210 --> 19:53.505
"Heronymous Bot." The FBI's
been hunting him for years.

19:53.506 --> 19:55.424
- Listen to me...
- If we get these records,

19:55.425 --> 19:57.845
I'll need your help tracking
timelines, piecing together...

19:57.846 --> 20:00.930
No! You want somebody to hold
your hand and say it's OK to go on this

20:00.931 --> 20:03.142
fucking goose chase.

20:03.143 --> 20:06.270
You shouldn't be teaching in Ithaca.
You're better than that.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.105
- You should be back...
- I belong here.

20:08.107 --> 20:10.026
Droning on to a bunch
of hung over English majors?

20:10.027 --> 20:11.985
- Exactly.
- You're wrong about the truth.

20:11.986 --> 20:16.325
There is objective truth.
He killed her.

20:16.326 --> 20:18.036
You know it's a fact.

20:18.037 --> 20:21.750
Here's a fact: my mom has ten,
15 years left at best.

20:21.751 --> 20:25.253
I've seen her more in the past
month than since I left for school.

20:25.254 --> 20:30.886
It's simpler here. It's quiet.
I need that. She needs me.

20:36.226 --> 20:42.148
I'm sorry, Lucas. I'm sorry
that night how I reacted.

20:42.149 --> 20:43.944
I'm sorry you lost
your girlfriend.

20:45.404 --> 20:47.948
I'm sorry the world
is this fucked up.

20:47.949 --> 20:50.117
I really am.

20:50.118 --> 20:52.329
But I can't help you.

20:59.881 --> 21:01.466
Thank you.

21:07.432 --> 21:10.935
- Where's everyone else?
- I did you a disservice yesterday.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.689
We shouldn't have put you
on the spot in front of all the leadership.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.692
Have a seat, Curtis.

21:20.156 --> 21:23.785
We know that you have an obligation
to take a firm stance,

21:23.786 --> 21:27.456
but entitlement reform
is something you ran on,

21:27.457 --> 21:30.543
and now it's within your grasp.

21:30.544 --> 21:33.881
So tell us your fears.

21:33.882 --> 21:36.133
That the Democrats
get another win.

21:36.134 --> 21:39.053
We suffer in the midterms and
the next Congress dismantles the agreement.

21:39.054 --> 21:41.097
You think we're
being disingenuous.

21:41.098 --> 21:43.643
My constituents
don't trust the administration.

21:43.644 --> 21:46.188
I can't have them thinking the wool has
been pulled over our eyes.

21:46.189 --> 21:49.734
As I suspected. Hector?

21:49.735 --> 21:53.572
Frank and I propose this:
we include a super majority point of order

21:53.573 --> 21:55.908
against revisiting
the issue for ten years.

21:55.909 --> 21:59.204
You'll have it in black-and-white.
A serious, long-term commitment

21:59.205 --> 22:00.748
with no opportunity
to dismantle.

22:00.749 --> 22:03.291
That's on top of everything
else we asked for.

22:03.292 --> 22:05.503
VA services and FEMA
stay at current levels.

22:05.504 --> 22:09.008
Everything else at 80 to a hundred
percent of the cuts you propose.

22:09.009 --> 22:13.555
You get your win, Curtis.
We just avoid disaster.

22:13.556 --> 22:16.894
Maybe the country needs
to see what disaster looks like.

22:16.895 --> 22:21.190
The tea party is a strong voice,
and you're its bullhorn.

22:21.191 --> 22:27.031
Show your people that voice can translate
into law, and not just add to the noise.

22:30.326 --> 22:33.455
Fifteen years before
revisitation, not ten.

22:35.208 --> 22:38.044
- OK. - And if the House fails to pass
the bill after we do,

22:38.045 --> 22:41.216
you go on record blaming your
own party for the gridlock.

22:43.635 --> 22:46.264
I believe we have a deal.

23:01.742 --> 23:04.703
What are you listening to?

23:04.704 --> 23:07.414
- Sorry. I'll turn it down.
- No, it's nice.

23:07.415 --> 23:09.751
Can I listen?

23:09.752 --> 23:12.336
My ears are clean, I promise.

23:12.337 --> 23:16.634
OK.

23:16.635 --> 23:18.471
Thanks.

23:25.353 --> 23:27.606
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

23:27.607 --> 23:31.612
- It's so sad.
- It helps me relax.

23:32.822 --> 23:35.575
Long day?

23:35.576 --> 23:38.702
I work at a call center.
So yeah.

23:38.703 --> 23:41.247
Two hundred strangers an hour.

23:41.248 --> 23:44.335
I'll leave you alone. You probably
don't want to talk to another one.

23:44.337 --> 23:49.424
It's all right. As long as you don't
hang up on me.

23:49.425 --> 23:53.639
Do you ever just talk to them?
The strangers?

23:53.640 --> 23:57.478
- We're not allowed to. - All I would want
to do is ask them about who they are.

23:58.521 --> 24:00.022
What about you?
What do you do?

24:00.023 --> 24:04.861
I... I work at the bookstore,

24:04.862 --> 24:05.989
at the day-care center.

24:08.784 --> 24:12.411
I had that same look on my face the first
time somebody handed me one of those.

24:12.412 --> 24:16.042
- I'm just... I'm not religious.
- Just keep it.

24:16.043 --> 24:19.420
Check it out. Or don't.

24:19.421 --> 24:21.925
We've got really
good music there.

24:24.637 --> 24:26.681
Thank you.

24:38.278 --> 24:42.700
The House sent a bill to the
Senate. What Frank wants to
send back bears zero resemblance.

24:42.701 --> 24:44.785
Because it's bipartisan,
unlike ours.

24:44.786 --> 24:46.872
That sounds like
something Frank would say.

24:46.873 --> 24:49.959
- I'm not Frank.
- He has a desk in your office.

24:49.960 --> 24:53.088
- If this bill passes in the Senate...
- It won't.

24:53.089 --> 24:56.633
We should be prepared, Bob.

24:56.634 --> 25:02.058
Well, I'm prepared
to wait and see.

25:02.059 --> 25:05.269
Have a good afternoon, ladies.

25:05.270 --> 25:08.523
- Ladies?
- He's threatened.

25:08.524 --> 25:11.694
- He's a pig. - Give him time. He used to
have two white, middle-aged guys

25:11.695 --> 25:14.865
at his side. Now he's got a black guy and
a woman 20 years his junior.

25:14.867 --> 25:16.951
Who knows how to shoot a rifle.

25:16.952 --> 25:19.788
We just need to keep at him.

25:19.789 --> 25:23.043
- Yes?
-<i> Catalina Rodriguez</i> <i>is on line four.</i>

25:25.922 --> 25:27.758
Give me a moment.

25:34.849 --> 25:39.146
- Catalina.
-<i> Ted told me</i> <i>it was you.</i>

25:39.147 --> 25:42.858
- <i> You there?</i>
- Yes. I'm here.

25:42.859 --> 25:45.195
<i>The press won't leave us alone.</i>
<i>For weeks.</i>

25:45.196 --> 25:48.616
<i>They're showing up, trying to</i>
<i>get pictures of me and Emily.</i>

25:48.617 --> 25:52.453
- It wasn't me.
- <i> You're the only one who knew.</i>

25:52.454 --> 25:56.375
- I don't know how the story got out.
- <i> Why would Ted lie about that?</i>

25:56.376 --> 25:59.672
I don't know.
Maybe... maybe he's ashamed.

25:59.673 --> 26:02.048
<i>So, what do I do?</i>
<i>When will they leave us alone?</i>

26:02.050 --> 26:05.095
I... I don't know, Catalina.

26:05.096 --> 26:07.640
<i>I can't live like this.</i>

26:07.641 --> 26:10.060
I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.

26:15.608 --> 26:19.487
How... how is Emily doing?

26:19.488 --> 26:21.992
Catalina?

26:31.296 --> 26:35.884
- He's very confident.
- Yeah, but does he have what it takes?

26:35.885 --> 26:40.723
- We'll see when I get his media plan.
- What about his personality?

26:40.724 --> 26:45.478
Charming. Direct.
Very thorough.

26:45.479 --> 26:47.899
He found our first
interview together, in '86.

26:47.900 --> 26:51.069
I would love to see that.
Does he have a copy?

26:51.070 --> 26:53.864
I don't think so. The TV
station made him watch it there.

26:53.865 --> 26:56.492
We should screen that for the
president and the First Lady.

26:56.493 --> 26:59.330
- Show 'em how it's done.
- Christina.

26:59.331 --> 27:02.124
- What about her?
- Have you noticed anything strange

27:02.125 --> 27:05.628
- between her and the president?
- How do you mean?

27:05.629 --> 27:09.050
I passed them
in the hall yesterday.

27:09.051 --> 27:13.055
They seem, I don't know...
very intimate.

27:13.056 --> 27:16.935
They did seem cozy
at the prep session.

27:16.936 --> 27:21.438
- Do you think...?
- No. Not necessarily.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.651
An interesting thought, though.

27:23.652 --> 27:25.987
- Sorry to interrupt, sir.
- We're having lunch.

27:25.988 --> 27:29.117
The Republicans are backing out. Mendoza's
chief of staff just gave me the heads up.

27:29.118 --> 27:33.496
- Get Mendoza on the phone.
- It's Curtis Haas. He got cold feet.

27:33.497 --> 27:37.585
Too many cages. It's
really... kind of inconvenient,

27:37.586 --> 27:40.714
but, you know, people look at
them. It's kind of funny. And...

27:40.715 --> 27:42.841
- I got your e-mail.
- Now good for you?

27:42.842 --> 27:46.888
Yeah, sure.
Can I call you right back?

27:46.889 --> 27:48.724
What exactly did you
need to know?

27:48.725 --> 27:51.060
We're doing some follow-up pieces
on the cyberwarfare thing.

27:51.061 --> 27:53.356
I just wanted to get
a layman's understanding

27:53.357 --> 27:55.732
of how the Chinese might
get through a firewall.

27:55.733 --> 27:58.194
It's a bit complicated,
but I can show you the basics.

27:58.195 --> 27:59.739
That's all I need.

28:16.302 --> 28:18.679
We use a standard
N-tier architecture.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.807
Think of it like a big sandwich,
with layers of bread.

28:21.808 --> 28:26.355
Between each is the lettuce, the tomato,
the roast beef, you know, whatever.

28:26.356 --> 28:29.942
What I'm pulling up here is the
org code which separates the database...

28:29.943 --> 28:32.779
Shit, I forgot there's a meeting
with sales in a couple minutes.

28:32.780 --> 28:34.948
- You wanna do this later?
- No, I'll just run over

28:34.949 --> 28:37.243
and let them know I'll be
a few minutes late. Be right back.

28:37.244 --> 28:39.121
Cool. I'll be here.

28:55.809 --> 28:58.188
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

29:00.940 --> 29:03.403
Yeah.

29:13.289 --> 29:16.710
Come on.

29:20.965 --> 29:23.009
OK.

29:30.436 --> 29:34.732
Delete. Go.

29:36.318 --> 29:39.154
- Something wrong?
- Can't find my phone.

29:39.155 --> 29:40.740
It's weird,
I had it a minute ago.

29:46.123 --> 29:48.416
Oh!

29:48.417 --> 29:51.169
- Here it is. Sorry about that.
- No problem.

29:51.170 --> 29:56.301
So the N-tier architecture, the
hi-tech sandwich I was talking about....

29:56.302 --> 29:58.636
I thought Mendoza was
willing to work with us.

29:58.637 --> 30:01.682
He is. The problem
is Curtis Haas.

30:01.683 --> 30:05.228
- And have you spoken with him?
- His office isn't returning our calls.

30:05.229 --> 30:08.065
- Neither is Mendoza's, but...
- I should've stuck to my guns.

30:08.066 --> 30:11.987
The vote isn't until tomorrow afternoon.
I'll reach out to Mendoza...

30:11.988 --> 30:17.619
This is the State of the Union,
Frank. I won't be left in limbo.

30:17.620 --> 30:21.081
If we need to start rewriting that
speech now, I don't want to waste a minute.

30:21.082 --> 30:23.793
I can turn this around, sir.

30:23.794 --> 30:27.547
Raymond told me this was your
idea, to pursue this compromise.

30:27.549 --> 30:31.345
- I suggested it as an option.
- No, he said you bullied him into it.

30:31.346 --> 30:33.639
That he thought
it was a mistake.

30:33.641 --> 30:36.559
If he felt so strongly,

30:36.560 --> 30:38.770
he should've have
advised you otherwise.

30:38.771 --> 30:42.274
Raymond's not a politician.
He relies on our political expertise

30:42.275 --> 30:44.235
as much as we rely
on his business acumen.

30:44.236 --> 30:46.780
Maybe we shouldn't
point fingers until there's a problem.

30:46.781 --> 30:49.408
- You wouldn't call this a problem?
- Not if it's solved

30:49.409 --> 30:51.787
before it becomes one.

30:53.414 --> 30:56.834
You see, I wanted a vice president
who can manage Congress,

30:56.835 --> 30:59.213
not one who bites off
more than he can chew.

30:59.214 --> 31:01.799
Then have faith you made
the right choice, sir.

31:01.800 --> 31:05.221
Whatever faith I have...
is quickly evaporating.

31:05.222 --> 31:09.809
Don't humiliate the administration, Frank.
You're part of it now.

31:09.810 --> 31:13.897
- Yes, sir.
- We're done.

31:13.898 --> 31:16.402
Thank you, Mr. President.

31:22.660 --> 31:24.327
Give me the private line,
please.

31:24.328 --> 31:28.123
Tusk is blocking my way.
Goodwin at my heels.

31:28.124 --> 31:29.959
There can be no false steps now.

31:29.960 --> 31:33.590
The higher up the mountain,
the more treacherous the path.

31:33.591 --> 31:36.926
Lucas Goodwin went up
to visit her.

31:36.927 --> 31:39.597
- They may be looking for you.
- Nobody's contacted me.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.223
I don't think anyone
knows I'm here.

31:41.224 --> 31:43.851
We need to make sure
it stays that way.

31:43.852 --> 31:47.441
Don't speak to anyone you don't have to.
Don't go anywhere you don't need to be.

31:49.611 --> 31:53.323
- Tell me you heard what I said.
- I heard you. I get it.

32:08.133 --> 32:10.052
I'm fine.

32:12.723 --> 32:15.601
- Let me put some ice on it.
- I said it's OK.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.717
What is this?

32:42.718 --> 32:44.929
What, are you going
through my garbage now?

32:48.225 --> 32:50.102
Someone gave it
to me on the bus.

33:00.323 --> 33:04.328
You let me know
if anyone contacts you.

33:37.661 --> 33:40.664
- Hey.
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.

33:40.665 --> 33:42.501
No worries.

33:55.809 --> 33:58.812
How much more you wanna
do right now? Fill in this area?

33:58.813 --> 34:01.232
Yeah, and one
more poppy down here.

34:01.233 --> 34:04.068
- That's a lot for one sitting.
- I know.

34:04.070 --> 34:06.030
OK.

34:37.445 --> 34:39.572
Francis?

34:47.873 --> 34:52.337
- You're heading in?
- Mendoza's an early riser.

34:52.338 --> 34:56.969
- You'll figure this out. - I need to prove
what the vice president is capable of.

34:56.969 --> 35:01.183
Don't prove it to them.
Prove it to me.

35:05.104 --> 35:08.107
Curtis has me by the
tea bags, Frank. I don't have
a working majority without him.

35:08.108 --> 35:12.236
- He wasn't elected leader.
- True. But I have to pick my battles.

35:12.237 --> 35:14.239
If you can't control him
on budgetary issues...

35:14.240 --> 35:17.076
It's not just him. It's the 15
senators he has under his thumb.

35:17.077 --> 35:18.997
I won't be the leader next year
if they turn on me.

35:18.998 --> 35:20.790
So he wants to be courted.
Sit him down...

35:20.791 --> 35:23.002
I already tried talking
to him. He wouldn't budge.

35:23.003 --> 35:25.045
- We'll both talk.
- He's made his position clear.

35:25.046 --> 35:26.964
We all shook hands
at this table.

35:26.965 --> 35:29.384
The most I can do is put
the substitute amendment on the floor

35:29.385 --> 35:33.305
with limited debate. And your people
can say whatever they want for the record,

35:33.306 --> 35:34.807
but we're gonna vote
the amendment down.

35:34.808 --> 35:38.897
I'm not interested
in symbolic gestures.

35:38.898 --> 35:41.440
Well, that's all I can offer.

35:41.441 --> 35:46.697
- Where's your courage?
- My power has limits, Frank.

35:46.698 --> 35:49.534
Five Republicans makes
you the deciding vote.

35:49.535 --> 35:52.538
Now, it's highly doubtful we can get
them to vote against their own party.

35:52.539 --> 35:54.874
- But they might abstain.
- - You'd need ten.

35:54.875 --> 35:57.961
Entitlement is the Republicans' white
whale. I can get at least two to flip.

35:57.962 --> 35:59.379
Then you'd only
need six abstaining.

35:59.381 --> 36:00.881
Erikson's already making calls.

36:00.882 --> 36:02.842
- Donner.
- And Pulaski.

36:02.843 --> 36:04.886
Get me a call list
so I can tag-team with him.

36:04.887 --> 36:06.056
Got it right here.

36:06.057 --> 36:07.457
We have to get medieval.

36:07.947 --> 36:10.450
When it comes to parliamentary
procedure, there's not a rule I don't know.

36:10.451 --> 36:12.368
Find me the ones we can bend.

36:12.369 --> 36:16.498
Mark, you're a sensible man.

36:16.499 --> 36:21.713
Yes, I... I know. I understand.

36:21.714 --> 36:23.507
What if...

36:23.508 --> 36:27.471
Tell you what, what if both
VA hospitals in your district...

36:27.472 --> 36:29.347
Yes, both of them. Hold on.

36:29.348 --> 36:31.476
- Who?
- Moriarty. I promised him an amendment

36:31.477 --> 36:32.892
for his bovine research center.

36:32.894 --> 36:35.020
- That makes six.
- Mark, if I can get you

36:35.021 --> 36:39.653
funding for both,
are you with us? Excellent.

36:39.654 --> 36:42.490
Well, you come by the White House
and have lunch with me sometime soon.

36:42.491 --> 36:44.700
Bye-bye. We have the numbers.

36:44.701 --> 36:47.245
Once you break the quorum call,
it's gonna be a little tricky.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.413
Tell me on the way.

36:48.414 --> 36:50.290
Sir.

36:50.291 --> 36:54.003
- Sir, we might not have a majority.
- What?

36:54.004 --> 36:57.216
The Dems are poaching people.
Donner, Pulaski. Maybe more.

36:57.217 --> 36:59.760
- Voting for the amendment?
- Some. Others abstaining.

36:59.762 --> 37:02.097
- I'm still trying to figure out who.
- We need to delay

37:02.098 --> 37:04.810
- and figure out what is going on.
- Quorum call.

37:04.811 --> 37:08.356
There's 49 hours until the
recess. We call a name an hour.

37:18.201 --> 37:20.746
- Mr. Avendale?
- Here.

37:31.676 --> 37:35.681
Excuse me, I do believe
you're sitting in my chair.

37:40.103 --> 37:42.732
Mr. Drewery, what is the order
of business?

37:42.733 --> 37:46.276
- We are in a quorum call, sir.
- Then why aren't you calling the roll?

37:46.277 --> 37:50.158
- We are, sir, in a deliberate manner.
- Let's speed it up.

37:51.535 --> 37:54.788
- Mr. Brown.
- Here.

37:54.789 --> 37:57.123
- More expeditious than that.
- Mr. Burr.

37:57.124 --> 37:58.417
- Here.
- Ms. Cantwell.

37:58.418 --> 37:59.961
- Here.
- Mr. Cerini.

38:04.926 --> 38:06.594
- Thank you.
- Cornwall.

38:06.595 --> 38:07.929
- Here.
- Mr. Colson.

38:07.930 --> 38:09.222
- Here.
- Ms. Douster.

38:09.223 --> 38:11.183
Here.

38:11.184 --> 38:13.771
They have a quorum.
We don't have the numbers.

38:13.772 --> 38:17.023
- Out, let's get all our people out.
- Mr. Demerell.

38:17.024 --> 38:19.569
- Mr. Darling. Mr. Daswani.
- Here.

38:19.570 --> 38:21.363
- Mr. Donner.
- Faster.

38:21.364 --> 38:23.449
- Mr. Dobben. Mr. Dwyer.
- Here.

38:23.450 --> 38:26.787
- Erinburgh, Engle, Erikson.
- Here.

38:26.788 --> 38:30.584
Mr. Feld. Farrison. Gentry.

38:33.128 --> 38:34.672
Mr. Haas.

38:35.882 --> 38:37.216
- Mr. Whitehouse.
- Here.

38:37.217 --> 38:40.094
Mr. Wicker. Mr. Wyden.

38:40.095 --> 38:44.685
Mr. President,
a quorum is not present.

38:49.440 --> 38:52.443
The chair recognizes the
minority leader, Mr. Erikson.

38:52.444 --> 38:57.449
Mr. President, "I move to direct the
sergeant at arms to compel the attendance

38:57.450 --> 39:01.121
of absent senators, that
warrants for the arrests of all senators

39:01.122 --> 39:06.294
not sick nor excused be issued under
the signature of the presiding officer."

39:06.295 --> 39:08.840
The question is on the motion,
all those in favor say aye.

39:08.841 --> 39:11.216
- Aye.
- All those opposed nay.

39:11.217 --> 39:13.887
- Nay! - The ayes have it,
and the motion is agreed to.

39:13.888 --> 39:17.809
The sergeant of arms is hereby
instructed to compel the
attendance of absent senators.

39:26.570 --> 39:30.199
It feels good
to be back in Congress.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.660
<i>The Democrats have now empowered</i>
<i>the Capitol Police</i>

39:32.661 --> 39:35.163
<i>to arrest absent members</i>
<i>if necessary.</i>

39:35.164 --> 39:37.666
<i>According to Republican</i>
<i>Senator Curtis Haas,</i>

39:37.667 --> 39:40.503
<i>one of the staunchest opponents</i>
<i>of the entitlement amendment,</i>

39:40.504 --> 39:43.884
<i>the vice president is, quote:</i>
<i>"Replacing democracy with tyranny.</i>

39:43.885 --> 39:48.890
<i>He's transformed the Senate into
a police state within the Capitol." But...</i>

39:48.891 --> 39:52.100
Well, it'll be even harder
to stay out of the news now.

39:52.101 --> 39:56.815
- Then why the joint interview?
- I watched the South Carolina one again.

39:56.816 --> 40:00.319
Convinced them to make me
a copy. It's powerful.

40:00.320 --> 40:02.573
Here you go.
I thought you might want it.

40:02.574 --> 40:06.451
There's a moment where
you ran your fingers through his hair.

40:06.452 --> 40:09.373
It's intimate. Human.
That moment alone

40:09.374 --> 40:10.958
would've made me want
to vote for your husband.

40:10.959 --> 40:15.088
Something like that
will buy you months

40:15.089 --> 40:16.674
of flying beneath the radar.

40:16.675 --> 40:19.260
And who do you have in mind
to conduct the interview?

40:19.261 --> 40:21.431
Does this mean I have the job?

40:23.099 --> 40:25.101
It means you still
haven't been ruled out.

40:25.102 --> 40:27.730
Well, I'll
consider that progress.

40:54.472 --> 40:57.892
This is the Democratic cloak room, Hector.
Yours is on the other side.

40:57.893 --> 41:01.605
- What you're doing won't work.
- It might.

41:01.606 --> 41:05.777
Which is why you made the long walk
over here. Ice water?

41:05.778 --> 41:08.447
I have my people in planes,
trains and automobiles.

41:08.448 --> 41:10.783
All I need is six
to make my quorum.

41:10.784 --> 41:14.746
Think what I can do with
26 votes, and I've got 45.

41:14.747 --> 41:17.540
You won't be able to get your planes
and trains back here fast enough.

41:17.541 --> 41:18.918
I'll roll those dice.

41:18.919 --> 41:23.048
The sergeant at arms
is very good at his job.

41:23.049 --> 41:27.053
And this is the perfect way
to show Curtis who's in charge.

41:27.054 --> 41:30.808
- I'm doing you a favor, Hector.
- Tell me what you want.

41:30.809 --> 41:33.521
What I've always wanted.
The package we shook hands on.

41:34.939 --> 41:37.315
Then I'll give you
your Senate back.

41:37.316 --> 41:41.363
- They can't come back voluntarily?
- Pick your six best actors.

41:41.364 --> 41:45.409
- We can't give in, Hector.
- We wouldn't be in this situation

41:45.410 --> 41:47.497
had you toed the party line.

41:50.792 --> 41:54.087
- Mr. Mendoza is present.
- Under protest.

41:54.088 --> 41:57.174
- Ms. Cornwall is present.
- Under protest.

41:57.175 --> 42:00.344
Mr. Ullman is present.
Mr. Walsh is present.

42:00.345 --> 42:02.806
Ms. Douster is present
and Mr. Haas is present.

42:02.808 --> 42:06.561
- Mr. President, a quorum is now present.
- You can pass the amendment.

42:06.562 --> 42:09.647
- I'll just filibuster the main bill.
- No, you won't.

42:09.648 --> 42:11.985
- Watch me.
- As much as I'd like to see you

42:11.986 --> 42:15.239
hold your piss for two days,
we struck a deal with Hector.

42:15.240 --> 42:19.911
Passage of the substitute amendment
constitutes passage of the main bill.

42:19.912 --> 42:23.331
- I wasn't informed of that.
- Pay attention to the fine print, Curtis.

42:23.332 --> 42:25.919
It's far more important than
the selling price. Let's go.

42:25.920 --> 42:29.048
I want an immediate call to the roll.
Don't let half a second pass.

42:29.049 --> 42:31.843
- Yes, sir.
- A quorum is present.

42:31.844 --> 42:35.431
The question is on the adoption
of the substitute amendment to HR 934,

42:35.432 --> 42:38.475
the yeas and nays have been
ordered and the clerk will call the roll.

42:38.476 --> 42:40.311
- Mr. Abner.
- Aye!

42:40.312 --> 42:41.979
- Mr. Avendale.
- Aye!

42:41.980 --> 42:43.398
Mr. Brown.

42:43.399 --> 42:45.235
I'd like to propose an amendment
to HR 934.

42:45.236 --> 42:47.486
Mr. Haas, you are out of order,
the roll call has begun,

42:47.487 --> 42:51.200
- the clerk will continue to call roll.
- Mr. Brown. Mr. Burr.

42:51.201 --> 42:52.826
- Aye!
- Ms. Catwell.

42:52.827 --> 42:54.204
- Aye!
- Mr. Cerini.

42:54.205 --> 42:55.581
- Aye!
- Mr. Chess.

42:55.582 --> 42:57.041
- Aye!
- Ms. Cornwall.

42:57.042 --> 42:58.710
- Nay!
- Mr. Colson.

43:58.995 --> 44:01.997
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:01.998 --> 44:05.043
- I'm glad you came.
- Yeah, me too.

44:05.044 --> 44:10.883
- What did you think?
- The music was really beautiful.

44:10.884 --> 44:15.473
- Not what you expected?
- I wasn't sure what to expect.

44:17.059 --> 44:20.187
- I'm Lisa.
- Rachel. Sorry.

44:20.188 --> 44:24.567
No. We've got cookies
and cake inside, if you...

44:24.568 --> 44:28.405
- I think I'm gonna...
- If you want to meet some of my friends.

44:30.075 --> 44:31.700
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

44:31.701 --> 44:34.289
- OK. Yeah.
- OK.

44:37.751 --> 44:41.171
We should add miracle worker
to your résumé, Frank.

44:41.172 --> 44:43.883
Lazarus makes
for a good magic act,

44:43.884 --> 44:46.635
but life would've been a lot easier if
the bastard hadn't died in the first place.

44:46.637 --> 44:51.226
Well, the president wanted to go ballistic,
but I calmed him down.

44:51.227 --> 44:53.937
<i>I said don't worry,</i>
<i>Frank will pull this out.</i>

44:53.938 --> 44:57.358
Did you? I don't blame you
for being two-faced, Raymond.

44:57.359 --> 44:59.151
It's good politics, as long
as you don't get caught at it.

44:59.152 --> 45:01.238
Now, Frank,
if you think that I...

45:01.239 --> 45:02.656
<i>It's OK, Raymond.</i>

45:02.657 --> 45:05.869
Jesus forgives you. Good night.

45:26.938 --> 45:30.024
Hello?

45:34.239 --> 45:36.199
Hello?

45:41.164 --> 45:44.793
- Care for some wine?
- No.

45:49.506 --> 45:51.469
Step into the room.

45:55.265 --> 45:57.809
Closer. Closer.

45:59.102 --> 46:01.229
- State your name and the date.
- Wait, why?

46:01.230 --> 46:03.816
State your name and the date,
please.

46:05.402 --> 46:08.697
Lucas Goodwin. February 13th.

46:08.698 --> 46:12.243
- Year.
- Two thousand fourteen.

46:12.244 --> 46:14.412
Are you currently or have
you ever been a member...

46:14.413 --> 46:16.122
- What is this?
- Are you or have you ever been

46:16.124 --> 46:18.001
a member of any
law enforcement agency?

46:18.002 --> 46:21.172
- I already told you I wasn't.
- Two-step verification.

46:21.173 --> 46:23.632
No. I'm not and I haven't.

46:23.633 --> 46:27.221
Are you currently or have you ever been an
informant for law enforcement?

46:27.222 --> 46:29.348
- No.
- - You think you might've been followed?

46:29.349 --> 46:31.684
- Anything strange the past few weeks?
- You know what?

46:31.685 --> 46:32.895
This is making me feel
uncomfortable.

46:32.896 --> 46:35.231
We're not fucking around here.

46:35.232 --> 46:38.776
If you think the FBI hasn't been
tracking your posts, then you're naive.

46:38.777 --> 46:45.327
- You think they know who I am?
- No, you hid yourself well.

46:45.328 --> 46:46.953
What are you going to do
with the <i> Herald?</i>

46:46.954 --> 46:49.207
- Nothing.
- Then why did you want access?

46:49.208 --> 46:51.876
I already had access. It's how I contacted
you in the first place.

46:51.877 --> 46:55.424
I just needed to know
if you were serious.

46:59.136 --> 47:04.351
That's Cashew.

47:04.352 --> 47:07.187
Why did you contact me?

47:08.523 --> 47:10.734
Because you're desperate.

47:13.530 --> 47:15.822
And I'm not fond of authority.

47:15.823 --> 47:19.578
<i>Just today, under the leadership
of Vice President Underwood,</i>

47:19.579 --> 47:22.873
the Senate passed HR 934,

47:22.874 --> 47:26.753
along with an historic
entitlement reform amendment.

47:26.754 --> 47:30.674
By raising the retirement age
to 68 and 64

47:30.675 --> 47:33.928
<i>for normal and early</i>
<i>retirement respectively,</i>

47:33.929 --> 47:38.144
<i>we will ensure entitlements</i>
<i>for generations to come.</i>

47:47.738 --> 47:52.034
And when the House passes that bill in
a few weeks, as I fully expect them to do,

47:52.035 --> 47:55.164
we will put the government
freeze to rest.

47:55.165 --> 48:01.254
We will continue the business of serving
our country rather than paralyzing it.

48:01.255 --> 48:04.091
The American people
deserve no less.

48:04.092 --> 48:08.347
<i>We stand at the</i>
<i>altar of democracy.</i>

48:08.348 --> 48:11.935
<i>Let us stand together.</i>

48:17.901 --> 48:22.490
I spoke to Jackie. You have
my support in the House.

48:22.491 --> 48:24.909
But it hasn't passed
the House yet.

48:24.910 --> 48:28.372
We've a long march before it
arrives on the president's desk.

48:28.373 --> 48:32.503
As for me, I used to be
on the edge of the frame.

48:32.504 --> 48:36.509
Now, I'm only three feet away.
