13:10.967 --> 13:12.467
I never should have put it on.

13:12.467 --> 13:15.167
I don't think the tanning lotion
had anything to do with it.

13:15.167 --> 13:18.133
- Really?
- It's unlikely.

13:18.133 --> 13:20.800
If tanning lotion could grow hair,
we'd have a cure for baldness.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.067
[ Larry ]
So, what is causing it?

13:23.067 --> 13:27.467
Oh, it's probably some sort
of skin irritation.

13:27.467 --> 13:29.467
It'll be gone before you know it.

13:29.467 --> 13:31.933
[ Dad ]
Could it be nerves, Doc?

13:31.933 --> 13:35.167
Yes. Uh, Larry has a
band audition coming up.

13:35.167 --> 13:38.600
Yes. Yes. Yes.
That's probably it.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.600
Um-- Uh--

13:40.600 --> 13:44.100
The nervous system can do
incredible things under stress.

13:44.100 --> 13:46.733
I guess you'll just have to take
it a little easier, right, Larry?

13:46.733 --> 13:49.233
I guess so.

13:49.233 --> 13:51.467
- [ Mom ] Thanks, Doc.
- Any time.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.700
[ Narrating ] There was
something weird about the way...

14:00.700 --> 14:02.767
my parents and the doctor
were acting.

14:02.767 --> 14:06.233
All I could hope was that the
hair would be gone by morning.

14:09.233 --> 14:11.767
- Hi, Jasper.
- [ Meows ]

14:11.767 --> 14:14.267
[ Yowling ]

14:18.767 --> 14:20.767
Phew.

14:21.267 --> 14:24.567
- Don't scare me like that.
- [ Meows ]

14:26.567 --> 14:29.067
[ Dog Barking ]

14:29.067 --> 14:31.600
Not again. Go away.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.933
Get! Get away. Go!

14:33.933 --> 14:36.933
- [ Yipping ]
- Wait a minute.

14:38.300 --> 14:40.900
Come here.

14:40.900 --> 14:43.400
Come here, girl.
Come here.

14:47.133 --> 14:49.567
- It's just like Lily's.
- [ Panting ]

14:51.367 --> 14:53.867
- [ Whining ]
- Those eyes.

14:55.900 --> 14:58.267
- Lily?
- [ Whimpering ]

15:00.333 --> 15:02.833
Come here!
Come here, girl. Come back.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.100
Hi, Mrs. Turnbull.
Goin' on a trip?

15:11.100 --> 15:13.600
Is, uh, Lily here?

15:13.600 --> 15:16.567
You must have the wrong house.
There's no one here named Lily.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.600
But Lily lives here.

15:20.100 --> 15:22.600
Listen to what I'm telling you.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.800
There is no Lily.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.800
Forget about her.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.100
- You'd better go.
- But Lily is--

15:38.100 --> 15:40.033
Go!

15:41.033 --> 15:43.700
Go.

15:45.833 --> 15:48.933
[ Engine Starts ]

15:55.967 --> 15:58.967
Mom! Dad!
Something weird's happening!

15:58.967 --> 16:01.433
I saw Lily.
I think she's a dog.

16:01.900 --> 16:03.967
- Oh, hi, Larry.
- Didn't you hear me?

16:03.967 --> 16:07.100
- How was practice?
- You're not listening. I saw this dog.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.733
It had eyes just like Lily,
and it was wearing Lily's gold coin.

16:10.733 --> 16:13.500
- That's silly.
- Gold coins are not uncommon.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.433
And lots of dogs
have different colored eyes.

16:15.933 --> 16:16.933
No, it's too weird.

16:16.933 --> 16:19.800
Her parents wouldn't even admit
they knew anyone named Lily.

16:21.300 --> 16:24.567
[ Chuckles ] That's ridiculous.
You must have misunderstood.

16:24.567 --> 16:27.300
- I didn't misunderstand anything!
- Larry.

16:27.300 --> 16:29.500
I know what I heard!
I know what I saw!

16:29.500 --> 16:31.867
It's that Instant Tan.
It has to be.

16:31.867 --> 16:34.500
Dr. Murkin's hiding something,
isn't he?

16:34.500 --> 16:37.767
- How about some roast beef?
- I don't want food! I want answers!

16:39.967 --> 16:41.733
Larry, don't run!

16:41.733 --> 16:44.667
Watch out for cars!

16:47.667 --> 16:49.600
[ Narrating ]
I couldn't believe it.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.600
I felt like I was going crazy.

16:52.100 --> 16:54.067
What were
my mom and dad hiding?

16:54.067 --> 16:56.067
Could Lily really be a dog?

16:56.067 --> 16:58.867
I felt so mixed up.
I wanted Lily back, and Manny.

16:58.867 --> 17:00.967
I felt so alone.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.400
It didn't make any sense,
but I kept thinking...

17:03.400 --> 17:05.000
it had something to do
with that Instant Tan.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.400
I wasn't sure exactly what.

17:07.833 --> 17:09.267
I put that stuff on my face.

17:09.267 --> 17:11.133
Maybe it was seeping through
my pores, affecting my brain.

17:12.900 --> 17:15.333
I went to the garage
where our band practiced.

17:15.333 --> 17:17.333
I wanted to talk to Jared.

17:17.333 --> 17:19.333
Maybe he could help me
find that lotion, get it tested,

17:19.333 --> 17:24.233
- figure some way out of this mess.
- [ Dog Barking ]

17:24.233 --> 17:26.599
It's about time.

17:26.599 --> 17:30.600
[ Narrating ] I was so freaked out,
I'd forgotten about the audition.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.167
- [ Barking Continues ]
- And that's when I saw the dog.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.900
Jared?

17:36.900 --> 17:38.900
It sounded like him.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.900
- Could it be?
- [ Whining ]

17:43.667 --> 17:46.033
Suddenly the little kid
ran to his father

17:46.033 --> 17:48.933
like he was scared of me
or something.

17:48.933 --> 17:52.133
- [ Barking ]
- Then I saw why.

17:52.133 --> 17:54.633
The hair-- it was back!

17:54.633 --> 17:57.533
[ Barking Continues ]

17:59.800 --> 18:03.133
What's wrong?
What's happening to me?

18:10.333 --> 18:12.833
Mom! Dad!

18:17.833 --> 18:20.333
Come on in here, Larry.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.833
- [ Panting ]
- We're sorry, Larry.

18:22.833 --> 18:25.333
We really wanted it to work out.

18:26.833 --> 18:28.700
Want a cookie?

18:33.200 --> 18:35.333
[ Whining ]

18:35.333 --> 18:39.567
[ Narrating ] Hello! Get a clue?
How 'bout a steak?

18:39.567 --> 18:43.800
- [ Growl ]    - Dr. Murkin said
his appetite might be affected.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.733
[ Whimpers ]

18:46.733 --> 18:49.733
Poor Larry.
He's had a hard day.

18:51.033 --> 18:52.967
Yummy, yummy.

18:52.967 --> 18:55.600
[ Narrating ] Ah, I guess
it's better than nothin'.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.600
Attaboy!

19:07.800 --> 19:10.300
[ Narrating ]
Now this seems familiar.

19:10.300 --> 19:13.667
Well, Mom and Dad-- the Boyds--
explained to me what happened.

19:13.667 --> 19:16.167
Excuse me.
I like to snack.

19:19.467 --> 19:21.467
- Hey, guys.
- [ Barking ]

19:21.467 --> 19:24.100
[ Narrating ] Anyway, Mr. and
Mrs. Boyd came here to be part...

19:24.600 --> 19:26.100
of Dr. Murkin's project.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.600
He learned how
to turn dogs into humans.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.100
That's why I got those shots
every two weeks.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.100
But I'm back to my old self now.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.900
Lily, Manny and Jared
come over all the time.

19:35.900 --> 19:40.633
We have fun chasing cars, barking
at strangers, scratching in public--

19:40.633 --> 19:44.433
all the cool stuff you don't
get to do when you're human.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.133
Uh-oh. I know that car.

19:47.567 --> 19:49.600
It's Dr. Murkin.

19:50.600 --> 19:53.900
What's he doing here?

19:53.900 --> 19:55.800
- What's he doing here?
- [ Barks ]

20:00.033 --> 20:02.433
[ Barking ]

20:02.433 --> 20:05.800
- [ Baby Fussing ]
- [ Growling ]

20:05.800 --> 20:08.967
It's okay, Larry.
Dr. Murkin isn't here to see you.

20:08.967 --> 20:12.600
That's right.
I'm through with dogs.

20:12.600 --> 20:15.233
- [ Panting ]
- [ Mrs. Boyd ] Oh, look.

20:15.233 --> 20:18.733
- She's smiling.
- [ Cooing ]

20:18.733 --> 20:20.733
- What a good little girl.
- Huh?

20:20.733 --> 20:24.233
Yes, you are.
You're a good little girl.

20:24.233 --> 20:27.100
Welcome to your new home,
Jasper.

20:27.100 --> 20:30.900
- [ Growls]
- [ Narrating ] Jasper? The cat? My Jasper?

20:33.400 --> 20:36.900
- [ Barking ]
- [ Crying ]

20:36.900 --> 20:39.800
- Come on in.
- Oh. Thanks.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.300
[ Narrating ]
Here we go again.
