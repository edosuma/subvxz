00:00.962 --> 00:05.081
If your brother contacts you,
you come and see me

00:05.082 --> 00:06.881
and I'll call the police for you.

00:06.882 --> 00:09.441
I just spoke to Matty
and you're torturing him.

00:09.442 --> 00:11.321
Look, you're his girlfriend.

00:11.322 --> 00:13.200
I'm no-one's fucking girlfriend,
all right?

00:13.201 --> 00:14.482
He's only got us now.

00:14.483 --> 00:17.122
No, Nick, he's only got you.

00:18.402 --> 00:20.561
You think the crash was my fault,
don't you?

00:20.562 --> 00:22.482
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:23.762 --> 00:25.162
Come on!

00:27.082 --> 00:28.560
What the fuck are you doing?!

00:28.561 --> 00:29.722
Saving your arse!

00:29.723 --> 00:31.882
I don't need fucking saving!

00:33.223 --> 00:34.702
Mates, then?

00:34.703 --> 00:36.902
Cos I could really do with one.

00:36.903 --> 00:39.783
What are you doing to me, Franky?

01:12.343 --> 01:15.922
Well, though, that is the theory.
But, I digress.

01:16.014 --> 01:17.533
Of course, I what I mean is,

01:17.534 --> 01:23.060
why shouldn't two seemingly
disparate forms merge - clash?

01:23.134 --> 01:23.753
Yeah?

01:23.771 --> 01:26.450
Absolutely. Tell me more.

01:26.451 --> 01:28.530
Old boundaries, they're like,
totally obsolete.

01:28.531 --> 01:32.490
It's time to... cross-pollinate.
Do you get what I mean?

01:32.491 --> 01:34.890
This is fascinating.

01:34.891 --> 01:39.250
Oh, that's what Ctrl.Alt.Country
is all about. Pollination.

01:39.251 --> 01:41.610
I can't wait for you to hear it.

01:41.611 --> 01:42.970
Me neither.

01:42.971 --> 01:45.530
So, er... Neil, are you four...?

01:45.531 --> 01:46.410
Nick.

01:46.411 --> 01:47.731
Course. Are you four couples?

01:47.732 --> 01:50.770
Oh, God, no.

01:50.771 --> 01:56.171
Um... No, I have a very... rare
condition. It's, um...

01:57.891 --> 02:00.931
a sealed vagina.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.730
She's, er... smooth.

02:06.731 --> 02:10.289
Like... Ken.

02:10.291 --> 02:12.250
It's sort of a membrane.

02:12.251 --> 02:13.650
Ken?

02:13.651 --> 02:14.530
I know.

02:14.531 --> 02:16.650
It's tragic.

02:16.651 --> 02:19.650
Jesus. So brave!

02:19.651 --> 02:22.611
Well, I'd... I'd better go
and... tune up.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.970
Right. They're out of booze,
and those are guitars.

02:33.971 --> 02:35.570
Time to do one.

02:35.571 --> 02:37.930
Give me two minutes.

02:37.931 --> 02:41.450
There are some seriously fucked-up
people in this house.

02:41.451 --> 02:43.970
Depressives, STDs,

02:43.971 --> 02:46.090
sleeping pills,
hormone replacements,

02:46.091 --> 02:48.570
some fucking heavy painkillers.

02:48.571 --> 02:50.171
It's awesome.

02:55.331 --> 02:56.531
That looks nasty.

02:56.532 --> 02:58.731
It is. That's the point.

03:00.251 --> 03:03.651
Right.
Let's take this baby for a spin.

03:04.211 --> 03:07.330
I'd like to thank you all for
sharing this moment with us.

03:07.331 --> 03:09.610
Oh, God, you're kidding.

03:09.611 --> 03:12.331
This is Digital Appalachia.

03:15.451 --> 03:19.450
* Tear down the walls and let it
Tear down the walls and let it *

03:19.451 --> 03:21.530
* Tear down the walls and
let it *

03:21.531 --> 03:23.290
* Tear down the walls and
let it

03:23.291 --> 03:24.810
* Blend *

03:24.811 --> 03:26.451
* Tear down the walls... *

03:29.011 --> 03:30.971
* Tear down *

03:32.571 --> 03:34.811
* Tear down the walls... *

03:35.971 --> 03:37.931
Oh, my God, that is foul.

03:42.851 --> 03:45.131
This music is a twat.

03:48.611 --> 03:49.171
Cool, Neil!

03:49.172 --> 03:51.450
Now can we go?!

03:51.451 --> 03:53.650
Sorry. Gotta go.

03:53.651 --> 03:57.010
Sorry, mate. You're crap.
Uber-crap.

03:57.011 --> 04:00.650
Are you sure this is a good idea?

04:00.651 --> 04:03.850
Don't be a twat, Franks.
You can't just steal.

04:03.851 --> 04:08.810
One fucking minute.
It's not stealing, it's borrowing.

04:08.811 --> 04:10.530
That is so fucking cool.

04:10.531 --> 04:14.570
Nice one. Awesome!
Alex, we need to go. I'm freezing.

04:14.571 --> 04:16.810
Give you a backy? My treat.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.891
Ugh!

04:25.691 --> 04:27.369
Fuck, you're heavier
than you look!

04:27.370 --> 04:28.451
It's my massive balls.

04:32.611 --> 04:35.451
Go on. It's not far now.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.570
Hey!

04:39.571 --> 04:41.811
It's my turn.

04:43.811 --> 04:46.010
Let's do this. Hold tight.

04:46.011 --> 04:47.451
Whoa!

04:54.811 --> 04:58.331
Oh, fuck! Oh!

Fuck it, come on!

05:12.251 --> 05:13.931
OK!

05:22.211 --> 05:23.771
Hello? Franky?

05:24.811 --> 05:26.331
Is that you in?

05:41.091 --> 05:42.811
This place is awesome!

05:46.131 --> 05:48.890
It's just my room.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.450
Stick some music on, yeah?

05:50.451 --> 05:51.851
Course.

05:56.571 --> 05:59.450
Nick. Eyes front?

05:59.451 --> 06:02.171
Yeah.

06:27.251 --> 06:28.530
Fuck!

06:28.531 --> 06:29.731
Shh!

06:32.171 --> 06:33.571
Oh!

06:42.371 --> 06:43.771
Have you still got that joint?

06:43.772 --> 06:46.451
Mm!

06:51.491 --> 06:53.171
It's a bit damp.

06:56.891 --> 06:59.131
Oh, it'll live.

07:34.651 --> 07:36.250
Nick...

07:36.251 --> 07:37.771
What?

07:40.971 --> 07:41.970
Franks...

07:41.971 --> 07:43.011
Don't spoil it.

07:43.012 --> 07:44.890
Why?

07:44.891 --> 07:47.491
Because I can't, all right?

07:52.771 --> 07:54.850
Is it about Luke, or...?

07:54.851 --> 07:57.850
No! I just can't, so leave it.

07:57.851 --> 08:00.731
Yeah, course.

08:02.091 --> 08:06.090
Look, it's stopped raining, so...

08:06.091 --> 08:08.371
Maybe you should...

08:11.731 --> 08:14.011
Yeah. You're right.

08:53.091 --> 08:54.211
Uhh...

09:11.051 --> 09:12.610
Nick?

09:12.611 --> 09:14.091
Nick, can you... Can you hear me?

09:14.092 --> 09:15.650
Matty! Fuck!

09:15.651 --> 09:16.850
You...

09:16.851 --> 09:18.210
You look like shit!

09:18.211 --> 09:19.811
Of course I fucking look like shit.

09:19.812 --> 09:23.051
Look, the net's crap here,
so I need to be quick.

09:24.291 --> 09:26.450
Mate, I'm coming home!

09:26.451 --> 09:27.811
I'm coming back.

09:33.051 --> 09:34.770
Nick! Did you hear me?!

09:34.771 --> 09:35.770
Oh!

09:35.771 --> 09:37.970
Can you concentrate, please?
This is important!

09:37.971 --> 09:39.531
I am, I am, I just got...

09:40.971 --> 09:44.290
Listen, it doesn't matter. All
right, I met some people, some guys,

09:44.291 --> 09:46.330
and they're gonna get me home
this week.

09:46.331 --> 09:47.730
How...?

09:47.731 --> 09:49.891
They're getting me a passport,
flights, everything.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.730
Wow.

09:52.731 --> 09:54.009
And, and... it's legit?

09:54.010 --> 09:55.289
What do you think?

09:55.290 --> 09:57.691
Jesus, Nick, will you just go to
the guy and pay him?!

09:57.692 --> 09:59.250
Pay him?!

09:59.251 --> 10:01.210
Have you got any money?

10:01.211 --> 10:04.050
Fuck. Dad's away on tour.

10:04.051 --> 10:05.570
He left me some for the house.

10:05.571 --> 10:07.130
That's a start, then.

10:07.131 --> 10:09.170
"A start"?! How much is this
going...?

10:09.171 --> 10:10.770
Look, I'll send you the address.

10:10.771 --> 10:13.330
You need to go today, Nick.
Today. OK?

10:13.331 --> 10:15.290
I've got college.

10:15.291 --> 10:17.090
Well, miss a fucking class!

10:17.091 --> 10:18.371
This is important!

10:20.531 --> 10:21.850
Sorry.

10:21.851 --> 10:23.091
I'll sort it.

10:24.931 --> 10:26.010
Course.

10:26.011 --> 10:28.651
And Franky! You need to tell her.

10:30.091 --> 10:31.651
Tell her I'm coming home!

10:32.371 --> 10:33.651
Tell her I...

10:39.011 --> 10:40.211
I will.

10:41.491 --> 10:42.691
Promise.

10:52.091 --> 10:53.411
Oh, God!

11:01.731 --> 11:03.651
Fuck.

11:46.211 --> 11:48.011
Fuck.

12:07.011 --> 12:10.091
I'm... here to see The Doctor.

12:12.451 --> 12:15.131
Da li da ga posaljem gore?

12:16.931 --> 12:19.650
The Doctor will see you now.

12:19.651 --> 12:20.731
Top floor.

12:48.091 --> 12:49.171
Hello?

12:59.571 --> 13:01.210
Ah...

13:01.211 --> 13:02.011
I'm Nick.

13:02.012 --> 13:03.450
Sit, my friend.

13:03.451 --> 13:04.371
Sit.

13:07.411 --> 13:10.291
Your brother tells me
you are resourceful.

13:16.651 --> 13:17.890
Smoke?

13:17.891 --> 13:20.850
No, thanks, I've got my own.

13:20.851 --> 13:22.771
Have one of mine.

13:39.491 --> 13:40.610
Drink!

13:40.611 --> 13:43.570
Strong cigarettes, Nico...

13:43.571 --> 13:47.211
for strong men.
Are you a strong man, Nico?

13:48.531 --> 13:50.930
I need you to be strong.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.851
We are not playing here, my friend.

13:52.852 --> 13:54.051
Of course.

13:55.171 --> 13:58.490
I need 2,000. Cash.

13:58.491 --> 14:00.610
And I need it tomorrow.

14:00.611 --> 14:02.410
Two grand?! I...

14:02.411 --> 14:05.131
I don't have that much. I've got...

14:07.491 --> 14:09.570
700, maybe.

14:09.571 --> 14:11.571
Put it away.

14:12.411 --> 14:15.090
No. You get 2,000.

14:15.091 --> 14:17.250
He gets passport and travel.

14:17.251 --> 14:20.450
You want your brother back,
you get it.

14:20.451 --> 14:22.691
He can be here in three days.
Three days.

14:24.251 --> 14:26.811
Your choice, my friend.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.730
Magnesium, right. Magnesium.

14:34.731 --> 14:37.211
So, what do we know about magnesium?

14:38.291 --> 14:39.370
No-one?

14:39.371 --> 14:41.490
Fine, right, OK.

14:41.491 --> 14:43.410
Inert through passivation.

14:43.411 --> 14:45.690
It dissolves in seawater.

14:45.691 --> 14:47.891
You might say it's a pussy...

14:48.651 --> 14:51.210
Sorry, I got held up.

14:51.211 --> 14:55.851
Fine, cool. Find your partner, sit.

14:56.651 --> 14:58.290
Right, where was I?

14:58.291 --> 14:59.130
You OK?

14:59.131 --> 15:00.650
Fine, yeah.

15:00.651 --> 15:02.250
Yes, magnesium.

15:02.251 --> 15:04.210
Lacklustre.

15:04.211 --> 15:06.610
Uninteresting.

15:06.611 --> 15:09.090
Unremarkable. Or is it?

15:09.091 --> 15:13.890
For one thing, it's the 11th most
common element in the human body.

15:13.891 --> 15:18.690
It's forged in the explosive
death throes of supernova stars!

15:18.691 --> 15:22.251
Can you imagine the power,
the pure fury of that?!

15:24.051 --> 15:26.610
It makes you feel helpless.

15:26.611 --> 15:28.450
And yet, look at it now...

15:28.451 --> 15:29.769
Are you sure you're all right?

15:29.770 --> 15:30.971
I said I'm good.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.210
In a layer of grey oxidisation.

15:33.211 --> 15:36.690
You'd never guess the fury
of its true soul,

15:36.691 --> 15:41.171
until... you put it under pressure!
Put on your goggles!

15:48.931 --> 15:49.411
Nick...

15:49.412 --> 15:50.891
I'm fine! Fuck's sake!

15:52.291 --> 15:54.451
Your goggles.

15:56.651 --> 15:57.491
Er...

15:58.571 --> 16:00.291
Yeah. Right.

16:01.211 --> 16:02.651
Turn on your burners!

16:06.131 --> 16:08.411
And... watch.

16:15.291 --> 16:17.770
You see? Its true self

16:17.771 --> 16:20.050
bursts forth with the force of

16:20.051 --> 16:22.051
the dying stars that brought it
into creation!

16:23.531 --> 16:25.370
Like...

16:25.371 --> 16:27.611
fuckin' magic!

16:30.051 --> 16:34.010
That, my friends, is inside
each and every one of you!

16:34.011 --> 16:38.010
Waiting to be set free!

16:38.011 --> 16:42.651
You just need the spark!

16:44.571 --> 16:45.971
Aah! Fuck's sake!

16:51.491 --> 16:53.770
Nick.

16:53.771 --> 16:54.570
Nick!

16:54.571 --> 16:55.610
What?

16:55.611 --> 16:57.330
What's wrong with you?

16:57.331 --> 16:58.850
I'm fine, all right?

16:58.851 --> 17:00.930
No, because that's bullshit.

17:00.931 --> 17:02.849
Look, I can tell something's
the matt...

17:02.850 --> 17:04.251
You know what the matter is.

17:05.771 --> 17:07.130
Look...

17:07.131 --> 17:09.290
Right then, who's gonna get smashed?

17:11.131 --> 17:12.609
What?

17:12.611 --> 17:14.130
You know, the Caravan.

17:14.131 --> 17:16.410
Two days, one club, one DJ.

17:16.411 --> 17:17.890
Gonna be awesome.

17:17.891 --> 17:21.010
Flangemeister's playing
for 48 hours straight!

17:21.011 --> 17:23.770
It'll be, er... legendary.

17:23.771 --> 17:25.450
Shall I just come back?

17:25.451 --> 17:26.491
No. It's fine.

17:27.771 --> 17:29.691
See you later.

17:32.691 --> 17:33.451
So?

17:33.452 --> 17:34.691
Huh?

17:36.571 --> 17:38.250
Fuck it, let's get smashed.

17:38.251 --> 17:41.130
Kapow, kapow!

17:41.131 --> 17:44.211
Who's ready for the Meister?

17:53.851 --> 17:57.730
OK, so the rules are...
Number one, no-one goes home.

17:57.731 --> 17:59.530
In.
Agreed.

17:59.531 --> 18:02.210
Number two, we match each other -
drink for drink,

18:02.211 --> 18:03.291
line for line, toke for toke.

18:03.292 --> 18:05.011
Done.

18:07.091 --> 18:08.370
No drugs here.

18:08.371 --> 18:10.649
You're gonna stay up for 48 hours
on booze alone?

18:10.650 --> 18:12.011
I plan on some blow jobs.

18:12.012 --> 18:13.530
Nice.

18:13.531 --> 18:16.210
OK, fine. You opt out on drugs.
We opt out on blow jobs.

18:16.211 --> 18:18.530
Can I have both?

18:18.531 --> 18:21.650
Yeah, good luck with that!
Number three, you vom, piss, shit

18:21.651 --> 18:23.770
or foul yourself in any way,
you lose.

18:23.771 --> 18:25.290
Isn't that always a rule?

18:25.291 --> 18:26.091
Shut up, Alex.

18:26.092 --> 18:28.410
Whatever. More drinks, who's up?

18:28.411 --> 18:30.290
I'm actually a bit short, mate.

18:30.291 --> 18:32.090
Me too.

18:32.091 --> 18:34.691
Maybe the drink for drink rule
might have to be reconsidered.

18:41.491 --> 18:43.410
Fuck it.

18:43.411 --> 18:45.250
I've got this.

18:45.251 --> 18:46.610
Whoa!

18:46.611 --> 18:47.811
Fuck me! Where did you get that?

18:47.812 --> 18:50.091
Does it matter?
Or do you wanna get messed up?

18:59.051 --> 19:00.051
Give you a hand?

19:00.052 --> 19:01.650
Course.

19:01.651 --> 19:02.770
Definitely.

19:02.771 --> 19:04.930
So you're good?

19:04.931 --> 19:06.450
Perfect.

19:06.451 --> 19:08.970
And, um, you and Franky earlier,
that was...?

19:08.971 --> 19:10.410
Nothing. Exactly right.

19:10.411 --> 19:12.690
OK.

19:12.691 --> 19:14.650
It didn't look like nothing.

19:14.651 --> 19:16.291
Look, mate, can you not take a hint?

19:16.292 --> 19:20.411
Yes. I just chose to ignore it.

19:22.251 --> 19:24.131
Look, she's just head-fucking me
a bit. I'm dealing with it.

19:24.132 --> 19:26.650
One bottle of champagne. £35.

19:26.651 --> 19:28.410
I don't get it.

19:28.411 --> 19:30.531
I mean, it all seems so... fraught.

19:31.891 --> 19:33.450
Keep the change.

19:33.451 --> 19:36.490
The way I see it,
you shouldn't get hung up on people.

19:36.491 --> 19:38.490
You just take them or leave 'em.

19:38.491 --> 19:40.251
You know, have fun, say thanks,
move on.

19:40.252 --> 19:42.011
Here, check this out.

19:44.211 --> 19:46.131
All these blokes, in this club now,

19:46.132 --> 19:47.810
right now,

19:47.811 --> 19:50.890
and I could probably fuck...
any of 'em.

19:50.891 --> 19:53.091
In fact, I'm gonna fuck him.

19:54.531 --> 19:57.130
I just select "poke"

19:57.131 --> 19:57.931
and... send.

20:05.131 --> 20:06.850
Yeah, well, I don't have that app.

20:06.851 --> 20:09.130
You don't need one. Come on.

20:09.131 --> 20:10.131
Look.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.611
There.

20:17.691 --> 20:19.690
Her.

20:19.691 --> 20:21.050
Fit.

20:21.051 --> 20:22.171
Perfect.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.451
Fuck it, you're right.

20:29.731 --> 20:31.690
Wish me luck.

20:31.691 --> 20:34.291
You won't need it, champ.
Take what's yours.

20:38.491 --> 20:40.810
Bollocks.

20:40.811 --> 20:45.651
Ich bin Flangemeister.
I will fuck you with my techno bass!

21:44.299 --> 21:45.499
Oh, Jesus!

22:05.459 --> 22:06.099
Ahh!

22:06.100 --> 22:08.298
Morning, sleepyhead.

22:08.299 --> 22:09.539
Morning.

22:10.979 --> 22:12.578
What are you doing?

22:12.579 --> 22:15.618
Watching you sleep.
I like it!

22:15.619 --> 22:17.539
OK.

22:19.259 --> 22:21.858
How long have you been... up?

22:21.859 --> 22:23.978
Oh, I haven't slept.

22:23.979 --> 22:26.818
I've been awake all night,
just thinking...

22:26.819 --> 22:28.898
thinking, thinking.

22:28.899 --> 22:31.139
About you, me, life.

22:32.739 --> 22:34.419
What's it all about, eh?!

22:35.539 --> 22:37.098
Right.

22:37.099 --> 22:38.458
Shit. Um... Well...

22:38.459 --> 22:42.218
I can't believe this is your house,
this is your room.

22:42.219 --> 22:44.658
It's so... real.

22:44.659 --> 22:46.538
So normal.

22:46.539 --> 22:47.899
Is it?

22:49.659 --> 22:50.859
Where do you...?

22:50.860 --> 22:52.938
You know, boarding school, the farm,

22:52.939 --> 22:55.898
boarding school, the farm.
Blah, blah, fucking blah!

22:55.899 --> 22:59.578
Boarding school? Heavy.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.778
Yep.

23:01.779 --> 23:03.698
Kind of got suspended.

23:03.699 --> 23:05.818
Kind of in the shit.

23:05.819 --> 23:08.698
Sort of haven't told anyone yet.

23:08.699 --> 23:10.538
Sort of ran away.

23:10.539 --> 23:12.778
Hey, maybe I could just stay here!

23:12.779 --> 23:15.418
I'm joking.

23:15.419 --> 23:16.779
Yeah, funny!

23:19.499 --> 23:21.338
What were you...

23:21.339 --> 23:23.578
Suspended for?

23:23.579 --> 23:25.898
God! Now, that's a story.

23:25.899 --> 23:27.379
Whoa!

23:31.619 --> 23:33.378
I need the toilet...

23:33.379 --> 23:35.818
Course, he'll never understand,
not really.

23:35.819 --> 23:38.738
Not with Delia around. Fucking Delia
and her fucking plastic tits

23:38.739 --> 23:40.539
and her fucking stupid
little whore dog.

23:40.540 --> 23:42.539
Sorry.

23:43.859 --> 23:46.699
It's just all a bit... raw, you know?

23:48.579 --> 23:49.778
Who's Delia?

23:49.779 --> 23:51.098
Spend the day with me.

23:51.099 --> 23:52.138
Mm...

23:52.139 --> 23:52.777
Please.

23:52.778 --> 23:53.699
I'd love to, but...

23:53.700 --> 23:55.938
Oh, come on, Nick.
We can have so much fun.

23:55.939 --> 23:58.178
We can do drugs, do acid in the zoo.

23:58.179 --> 23:59.738
Fuck on the Downs.

23:59.739 --> 24:02.818
Come on! We can do anything.
Anything you like.

24:02.819 --> 24:05.258
One day. Please.

24:05.259 --> 24:06.019
Well, I...

24:10.059 --> 24:12.699
I'd better...

24:14.659 --> 24:16.619
I'm fucking coming!

24:19.699 --> 24:20.618
Hey.

24:20.619 --> 24:22.459
Hi.

24:23.859 --> 24:25.018
Can I come in?

24:25.019 --> 24:26.498
What, now?

24:26.499 --> 24:28.858
Er, yeah.

24:28.859 --> 24:30.458
Why are you being weird?

24:30.459 --> 24:32.498
I'm not. I'm just, um...

24:32.499 --> 24:34.659
Nick?

24:42.939 --> 24:45.259
Carly, Franky. Franky, Carly.

24:46.539 --> 24:48.099
Hi.

24:49.499 --> 24:50.978
What are you doing?

24:50.979 --> 24:53.978
Nothing. Just...
you know, chatting.

24:53.979 --> 24:56.418
Right, are you...? You're not...?

24:56.419 --> 24:57.738
No.

24:57.739 --> 24:59.219
No. God, no!

25:02.019 --> 25:05.379
OK, so, um... I'm gonna...

25:15.819 --> 25:17.979
Yeah, well, thanks for that.

25:19.299 --> 25:21.259
I'll leave you to it.

25:44.259 --> 25:45.298
I'm going.

25:45.299 --> 25:47.378
You don't have to go. She's just...

25:47.379 --> 25:48.419
Don't.

25:50.419 --> 25:53.899
Look, Nick... I can tell you're into
that girl. I'm not stupid.

25:55.739 --> 25:57.899
And she's into you.

26:03.819 --> 26:05.779
Carly, wait.

26:23.979 --> 26:25.819
Shit!

26:33.259 --> 26:35.858
Nick? Nick, that you?

26:35.859 --> 26:37.139
Yes, mate. How are you?

26:37.140 --> 26:38.498
Did you do it?

26:38.499 --> 26:40.739
How much do you know about this guy?
He seems messed up.

26:40.740 --> 26:43.978
Course he's messed up.
This is a messed-up situation.
He's not fucking Expedia.

26:43.979 --> 26:45.498
I know, I know, but...

26:45.499 --> 26:47.977
I don't think I trust him.
He... he's pretty scary.

26:47.978 --> 26:49.419
Don't you want me to come back?

26:49.420 --> 26:53.818
Of course I do. I do!
But there's some people who.

26:53.819 --> 26:56.538
Fuck's sake, Nick.
Why don't you just spit it out?

26:56.539 --> 26:58.538
People. They think I killed Grace.

26:58.539 --> 27:00.938
Fine, they hate me.
But I didn't kill Grace!

27:00.939 --> 27:02.099
I know. I know.

27:03.459 --> 27:04.739
Did you tell Franky?

27:04.740 --> 27:06.858
Mate, she's dumped you, OK?

27:06.859 --> 27:08.659
I know. But I'm not accepting that.

27:08.660 --> 27:12.298
Understand?
I need her, Nick, all right?

27:12.299 --> 27:15.338
You need to tell her that.

27:15.339 --> 27:17.738
You know what? Fuck this.

27:17.739 --> 27:20.858
Either you help me or you don't.
Do whatever the fuck you like.

27:20.859 --> 27:22.138
Matty...

27:22.139 --> 27:23.379
See you around, Nick.

27:38.739 --> 27:42.499
'Please enter your customer number.'

27:44.499 --> 27:46.818
'Thank you. Please wait.

27:46.819 --> 27:48.619
'Good morning.
Can I have your name, please?'

27:48.620 --> 27:50.058
Hi, I'm Leon Levan.

27:50.059 --> 27:52.698
'Thank you. Just getting
your details now.

27:52.699 --> 27:56.819
'Can I have your memorable word
or phrase, please, Mr Levan?

27:59.179 --> 28:00.379
'Do you have it?'

28:00.380 --> 28:03.979
Of course I have it.
It's my... password.

28:06.339 --> 28:07.858
'Mr Levan?'

28:07.859 --> 28:11.498
Siobhan. It's Siobhan.

28:11.499 --> 28:13.538
1,940.

28:13.539 --> 28:15.658
1,960.

28:15.659 --> 28:17.818
1,980.

28:17.819 --> 28:20.419
And that's £2,000 exactly.

28:40.819 --> 28:42.498
You've done well, my boy.

28:42.499 --> 28:45.298
Amazing what can be achieved
if you want it enough, no?

28:45.299 --> 28:46.698
Sure.

28:46.699 --> 28:48.818
So, er... what now? Do I...?

28:48.819 --> 28:51.298
Ah-ah-ah. All in good time, Nico.

28:51.299 --> 28:53.099
Patience.

29:03.419 --> 29:06.298
Nico, there have been some
complications.

29:06.299 --> 29:07.738
Complications?

29:07.739 --> 29:11.098
I'm afraid our costs have risen.
We need an extra 1,000.

29:11.099 --> 29:12.819
That's all I've got, and you said...

29:12.820 --> 29:16.018
I say many things,
but then these things change.

29:16.019 --> 29:18.978
Like when I told my wife
I wouldn't fuck her sister.

29:18.979 --> 29:21.538
But such is life.

29:21.539 --> 29:24.498
No! This is bullshit! I...
I want my money back. It's off.

29:24.499 --> 29:26.578
The money is already accounted for.

29:26.579 --> 29:28.378
Accounted for? Fuck's that mean?

29:28.379 --> 29:29.938
It means you should sit down.

29:29.939 --> 29:33.898
Listen, mate, back off, yeah?
Ah, fuck!

29:33.899 --> 29:36.099
The situation is what it is, Nico.

29:37.699 --> 29:39.939
Now, you can get us
extra money, or...

29:41.979 --> 29:43.978
you can say goodbye
to what you already paid.

29:43.979 --> 29:46.618
And your brother.

29:46.619 --> 29:48.619
Understood?

30:36.659 --> 30:38.138
'Hey! Nickosaur!'

30:38.139 --> 30:40.178
Ah, fuck... Where are you?

30:40.179 --> 30:43.258
'Still here, mate. Still here.'

30:43.259 --> 30:44.378
Still where?

30:44.379 --> 30:47.298
'The club, mate. 48 hours.
You fucking cheated!

30:47.299 --> 30:49.818
'Cheat, cheat, cheat!'

30:49.819 --> 30:51.737
I was hoping I could talk
to you, mate.

30:51.738 --> 30:53.539
'Always, mate.
Come down, everyone's here.

30:53.540 --> 30:55.178
'Yeah, knock me one out.'

30:55.179 --> 30:56.259
Yeah. But, mate...

30:56.260 --> 30:59.538
'No, no, no. A big one.
Oi, Nick's coming down! Wa-he-hey!

30:59.539 --> 31:02.859
'Can't hear you, mate.
Come down. See you!'

31:28.739 --> 31:30.338
So we're not dancing, then?

31:30.339 --> 31:32.978
Mr Nick! You made it, man.

31:32.979 --> 31:36.578
I've been dancing for 18 hours.
I have blisters.

31:36.579 --> 31:38.858
Yeah, my bum is so chafed.
It's painful.

31:38.859 --> 31:41.418
Speak for yourselves.
We've just got here.

31:41.419 --> 31:43.859
You can tell
because we don't smell like balls.

31:49.419 --> 31:52.098
So! What's the big shit, mate?

31:52.099 --> 31:53.259
Plop it out.

31:54.339 --> 31:56.858
Said you... wanted to talk?

31:56.859 --> 31:57.659
No, I didn't.

31:57.660 --> 32:01.818
No, you did! You said... you said,
"I wanna talk to you"!

32:01.819 --> 32:05.378
Oh, come on! We're all mates.
All right?

32:05.379 --> 32:07.738
Share the wealth. Yeah?

32:07.739 --> 32:09.499
A problem shared is a problem...

32:13.259 --> 32:14.498
Se-seven...?

32:14.499 --> 32:17.059
He obviously doesn't wanna
talk about it, you fucking Joey.

32:20.979 --> 32:22.459
Are you all right, mate?

32:25.459 --> 32:26.739
I'm in trouble.

32:29.459 --> 32:30.818
What sort of trouble?

32:30.819 --> 32:34.418
Some guys...
I owe some money to some guys.

32:34.419 --> 32:35.858
What kind of guys?

32:35.859 --> 32:38.899
Dodgy guys. Really fucking
dodgy guys. I don't... have it.

32:41.099 --> 32:43.379
For Matty, for a... passport.

32:50.459 --> 32:51.418
W-Why?

32:51.419 --> 32:53.259
I paid two grand and I need another.
Otherwise.

32:53.260 --> 32:55.418
Otherwise what?

32:55.419 --> 32:58.538
Alo's right. Why? Why the fuck
would you want to do that?

32:58.539 --> 32:59.577
That's not what I meant.

32:59.578 --> 33:00.777
Cos he's my brother, Mini.

33:00.778 --> 33:02.259
Your brother who killed Grace.

33:02.260 --> 33:06.338
Fuck you! He did not kill Grace.
And how the fuck would you know?

33:06.339 --> 33:08.378
Well, she's not fucking here,
is she?

33:08.379 --> 33:09.218
Mini...

33:09.219 --> 33:13.178
How about you give Rich a grand?
Hey, Nick?

33:13.179 --> 33:15.698
Give him a grand and get
Gracie back? You like that, Rich?

33:15.699 --> 33:17.058
Don't, Mini. Just don't.

33:17.059 --> 33:18.099
Rich, he didn't kill her.

33:18.100 --> 33:20.258
Nick, I don't care.

33:20.259 --> 33:23.018
And this...
just leave me out of it, all right?

33:23.019 --> 33:24.179
Look, maybe we all need
to calm down, yeah?

33:24.180 --> 33:25.819
What about you, Franky?

33:28.459 --> 33:29.858
Honestly?

33:29.859 --> 33:30.898
Yeah.

33:30.899 --> 33:33.059
He can go fuck himself.

33:36.379 --> 33:37.778
Well, you know what?

33:37.779 --> 33:40.219
Fuck it, then. Fuck all of you.

33:54.539 --> 33:57.098
Nick. Nick!

33:57.099 --> 33:57.938
What?!

33:57.939 --> 34:01.098
I might be able to help.

34:01.099 --> 34:02.818
Yeah? Why don't you just stop

34:02.819 --> 34:05.259
trying to fucking help me,
all right?

34:09.619 --> 34:10.257
Hey, dude, I was...

34:10.257 --> 34:11.219
Back off, yeah, mate?

34:19.299 --> 34:20.819
Ahh!

34:25.739 --> 34:27.259
Nick. Let me in.

34:28.699 --> 34:29.579
What are you doing?

34:29.580 --> 34:31.338
What are you doing?

34:31.339 --> 34:34.458
Getting high.
Fuck does it look like?

34:34.458 --> 34:36.379
Hey! Fuck!

34:39.739 --> 34:40.536
Why didn't you tell me?

34:40.538 --> 34:42.259
I can't believe you fucking
did that!

34:42.260 --> 34:45.378
Don't push me, Franky. I swear...

34:45.379 --> 34:48.138
I said, why didn't you
fucking tell me?

34:48.139 --> 34:49.777
Oh, you care now, do you?

34:49.779 --> 34:51.418
I care about you, Nick.

34:51.418 --> 34:54.538
No, you don't.
You don't give a fuck about anyone.

34:54.539 --> 34:56.538
You're a head-fuck, Franky.

34:56.539 --> 34:59.018
You haven't spoken to him
for months.

34:59.019 --> 35:00.019
He's your fucking boyfriend!

35:00.020 --> 35:04.378
Oh, is he fuck!
He's a selfish, messed-up pussy.

35:04.379 --> 35:07.378
And you are letting him
fuck you again.

35:07.379 --> 35:08.299
I have to.

35:08.300 --> 35:10.298
And you always will.

35:10.299 --> 35:12.458
Yeah. Yeah, I will.

35:12.459 --> 35:15.979
Then what the fuck are you doing
here with me, Nick?

35:17.819 --> 35:19.739
You know what? You're right.

35:21.739 --> 35:23.778
Oh, that's right - just run away!

35:23.779 --> 35:25.218
I wish I fucking could!

35:25.219 --> 35:27.378
But I can't.

35:27.379 --> 35:30.938
Cos you're in here. And here.

35:30.939 --> 35:35.178
And part of me would give anything

35:35.179 --> 35:38.138
for you to just disappear,
just be fucking...

35:38.139 --> 35:40.218
gone.

35:40.219 --> 35:41.739
But it's a tiny part.

35:43.379 --> 35:46.258
The rest of me...

35:46.259 --> 35:50.658
The rest of me would take even this,
even this shit feeling right now,

35:50.659 --> 35:55.578
over any other feeling
about any other girl.

35:55.579 --> 35:57.938
Because compared to this,
I haven't felt

35:57.939 --> 36:00.058
a single fucking thing in my life.

36:00.059 --> 36:01.698
Shut up.

36:01.699 --> 36:02.938
I love you.

36:02.939 --> 36:06.378
Franky. I do.

36:06.379 --> 36:09.138
Yeah, and when he comes back?

36:09.139 --> 36:13.578
It doesn't fucking matter.
Nothing does.

36:13.579 --> 36:15.939
Cos you don't want me, do you?

36:21.539 --> 36:22.538
No.

36:22.539 --> 36:24.058
You're lying.

36:24.059 --> 36:26.059
Fuck you!

36:42.059 --> 36:43.339
Hey, what are you doing?!

36:48.619 --> 36:49.979
I'm sorry I'm a cunt.

37:35.659 --> 37:37.699
Hey! You can't...

37:50.139 --> 37:51.459
Where's my fucking money?

38:18.979 --> 38:20.298
I told you, Nico.

38:20.299 --> 38:21.899
It's all been accounted for.

38:28.259 --> 38:30.098
Family, Nico.

38:30.099 --> 38:32.938
You protect them because you have to.

38:32.939 --> 38:35.178
But it's a weakness.

38:35.179 --> 38:37.339
Every good man has it.

38:40.259 --> 38:42.218
Da li je sve uredu?

38:42.219 --> 38:44.418
Everything's just fine, Savo.

38:44.419 --> 38:48.339
In a moment,
Nico is going to walk out that door.

38:50.659 --> 38:54.338
And we will never see
each other again.

38:54.339 --> 38:56.339
Right, Nico?

39:31.379 --> 39:33.019
You looking for these?

39:42.779 --> 39:44.059
Can I come in?

39:45.379 --> 39:47.179
Yeah, s'pose.

40:04.459 --> 40:05.658
You all right?

40:05.659 --> 40:06.819
Not really.

40:11.619 --> 40:13.179
He's called me six times.

40:14.939 --> 40:17.299
I want you to tell him to stop.

40:18.979 --> 40:19.859
Why?

40:21.859 --> 40:23.539
Because it's over, Nick.

40:37.739 --> 40:39.618
It's all there.

40:39.619 --> 40:41.458
Where d'you get it?

40:41.459 --> 40:44.658
Sort of an inheritance.

40:44.659 --> 40:46.979
It's for you, Nick. Not him.

40:53.499 --> 40:55.018
Ohh! Keep it.

40:55.019 --> 40:58.538
It was a fucking awful idea
and I knew it was.

40:58.539 --> 41:01.939
And now I'm pretty fucking certain
they won't take it.

41:03.979 --> 41:05.179
Shit.

41:07.299 --> 41:08.379
What did you do?

41:08.380 --> 41:09.819
Doesn't matter, Franks.

41:20.419 --> 41:21.899
What do you want from me, Nick?

41:23.419 --> 41:25.538
Franky...

41:25.539 --> 41:29.619
you are the most beautiful person
I've ever seen.

43:00.539 --> 43:01.899
So what now?

43:06.499 --> 43:07.979
Maybe we just enjoy it.

43:10.139 --> 43:11.419
Sounds good.

43:15.379 --> 43:16.699
Sounds perfect.

43:55.939 --> 43:57.538
Nick...?

43:57.539 --> 43:59.219
Nick?

44:02.579 --> 44:03.899
Franky?

44:25.199 --> 44:37.959
