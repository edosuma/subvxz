Robert Hix here for Samuel Bachman.

01:08.415 --> 01:10.383
Hello fans of ShowBiz Today,

01:10.385 --> 01:12.743
this afternoon we are in the backyard

01:12.745 --> 01:15.323
of Hollywood schlockmeister
Samuel Bachman.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.883
Please, call me Sammy.

01:17.885 --> 01:21.403
As I was saying Sammy
Bachman has Hollywood all abuzz

01:21.405 --> 01:23.203
because in a dazzling bid of showmanship,

01:23.205 --> 01:25.153
he managed to outbid the entire town

01:25.155 --> 01:29.035
for the rights to the national
bestseller, Angels on Tap.

01:30.745 --> 01:33.493
So tell us, how did you pull of this coup.

01:33.495 --> 01:36.073
How does Sammy Bachman,
formerly best known

01:36.075 --> 01:39.853
for such straight video
schlock as Wuthering Heights,

01:39.855 --> 01:42.883
A Gool of My Dreams and One Man's Poison,

01:42.885 --> 01:45.833
win out in a bidding war
that ultimately pitted you

01:45.835 --> 01:48.363
against the legendary Harvey Weinstein

01:48.365 --> 01:51.043
for the rights of this
modern comedy classic?

01:51.045 --> 01:54.943
Well, if I do say so
myself, when Sammy Bachman

01:54.945 --> 01:58.403
sets his sights on something,
he's a regular bagel.

01:58.405 --> 01:59.403
A bagel?

01:59.405 --> 02:00.563
Yeah you know the southern dogs

02:00.565 --> 02:02.463
with the good nose and the flop ears.

02:02.465 --> 02:03.893
Do you mean a Beagle?

02:03.895 --> 02:06.503
Bagel, Beagle, potatoes,
potatoes, listen,

02:06.505 --> 02:07.932
all I knew, once I quit horsing around

02:07.934 --> 02:10.092
with those measly 10 grand raises

02:10.095 --> 02:13.763
and I raised ol' Harv
a cool mill, he plots.

02:13.765 --> 02:14.883
Plots?

02:14.885 --> 02:18.853
Yeah you know, plots, like fold up,

02:18.855 --> 02:20.373
the way something folds up

02:20.375 --> 02:22.465
when you raise it a cool mill, uhn yeah.

02:23.395 --> 02:24.383
Like a Harvey Weinstein.

02:24.385 --> 02:25.574
Yeah like that.

02:25.576 --> 02:28.123
Aren't your worried
that he'll seek revenge.

02:28.125 --> 02:31.323
Rumor has it Mr. Weinstein
does not like loosing.

02:31.325 --> 02:32.156
Who likes loosing?

02:32.158 --> 02:33.943
Did that English guy Lord Nielson,

02:33.945 --> 02:35.873
did he like loosing at Waterloo?

02:35.875 --> 02:39.393
Actually it's Lord Nelson
and he won at Waterloo,

02:39.395 --> 02:40.813
it was Napoleon who lost.

02:40.815 --> 02:41.648
It was.

02:42.917 --> 02:43.863
Well that's not the way we had it

02:43.865 --> 02:45.513
in the Wild Women of Waterloo.

02:45.515 --> 02:47.843
Our ending is better, if he'd lost,

02:47.845 --> 02:50.745
Napoleon would have been in
no mood for a full scale orgy.

02:51.830 --> 02:55.463
Yeah getting back to Harvey Weinstein,

02:55.465 --> 02:57.833
aren't you worried that
you've made yourself

02:57.835 --> 02:59.362
a dangerous enemy.

02:59.364 --> 03:01.085
Yeah, are you kidding, me and ol' Harv,

03:02.075 --> 03:04.263
we're like this, believe me,

03:04.265 --> 03:06.565
it's just a coincidence
I hired a food taster.

03:08.975 --> 03:10.273
I think our audience would like to know

03:10.275 --> 03:12.863
what it was about this story
that touched you so much

03:12.865 --> 03:16.203
that you would, if the rumors are true,

03:16.205 --> 03:19.143
'caused you to sell off
your entire art collection

03:19.145 --> 03:20.645
in order to buy the rights.

03:23.165 --> 03:24.483
Those rumors are true.

03:24.485 --> 03:28.730
I had to sell off all my
Monits, and my Daidies

03:28.732 --> 03:30.663
and even my precious Suzzanies.

03:30.665 --> 03:34.213
I believe you mean
Monets, Dolly's and Suzanis.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.341
Did you ever own one?

03:35.343 --> 03:36.174
No.

03:36.176 --> 03:37.183
My point exactly.

03:37.185 --> 03:41.763
Okay well out of all
the books out there,

03:41.765 --> 03:46.213
what, why did you need to
turn Angels into a movie.

03:46.215 --> 03:50.793
Because it was so darn magical.

03:50.795 --> 03:52.373
You haven't read it have you?

03:52.375 --> 03:55.723
No, I'm a pretty busy guy.

03:55.725 --> 03:57.573
Yeah sure, you probably
spend hours a day

03:57.575 --> 03:58.643
messing with that hair.

03:58.645 --> 04:03.645
Not hours, hair like
this doesn't grow on trees.

04:03.665 --> 04:05.545
Don't I wish, trees I have.

04:06.479 --> 04:08.203
Let me tell you about the book
and maybe you'll understand

04:08.205 --> 04:10.353
why I had to buy the rights.

04:10.355 --> 04:12.333
Relax Bobby, you wanted to know why

04:12.335 --> 04:13.503
I had to sell off my art collection,

04:13.505 --> 04:14.336
I'm gonna tell you.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.433
So it starts out, this poor dumb shmuck

04:16.435 --> 04:17.523
is driving home from work.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.785
It so happens, he's a reporter,

04:20.695 --> 04:23.343
always had dreams of writing a bestseller,

04:23.345 --> 04:26.133
but like someone else I
know, he never had the time,

04:26.135 --> 04:29.243
but what he really lacked
was a story worth telling.

04:29.245 --> 04:31.843
Anyway so he's driving home from work

04:31.845 --> 04:34.363
and his car begins to act up
so he pulls off the freeway,

04:34.365 --> 04:36.454
think he's gonna call Triple A,

04:36.456 --> 04:38.806
he finds that his cell
phone is dead.

04:56.865 --> 05:01.603
So he spots a bar, he
figures, have a groosky,

05:01.605 --> 05:04.795
call the Auto Club,
while he waits for a tow.

05:05.665 --> 05:08.425
He steps inside, and what does he see?

05:09.845 --> 05:12.615
I don't know, I told you
I didn't read the book.

05:13.755 --> 05:14.586
Angels.

05:14.588 --> 05:15.419
Angels?

05:15.421 --> 05:19.343
Real live angels, like
I told you, it's magical.

05:19.345 --> 05:20.176
Now I'm gonna tell you

05:20.178 --> 05:22.343
exactly how I see the movie in my head.

05:22.345 --> 05:24.983
Now you might thing it would
be a rather startling sight,

05:24.985 --> 05:26.113
maybe you're even thinking

05:26.115 --> 05:27.573
he wouldn't notice right off the bat,

05:27.575 --> 05:29.603
even if you weren't worried about your car

05:29.605 --> 05:31.013
and whether the Auto Club would arrive

05:31.015 --> 05:32.243
before the second coming

05:32.245 --> 05:34.123
or whether there'd ever be
peace in the Middle East

05:34.125 --> 05:36.433
or whether my red socks
would ever have the

05:36.435 --> 05:38.733
to carry themselves through July for once,

05:38.735 --> 05:42.093
what you need to remember
is everyone in the bar

05:42.095 --> 05:44.793
from the bartender to the customers alike,

05:44.795 --> 05:46.433
they all had wings

05:46.435 --> 05:47.833
and under those circumstances,

05:47.835 --> 05:50.143
it might not be as
obvious as you may think.

05:50.145 --> 05:52.473
Anytime enough people
are doing the same thing,

05:52.475 --> 05:54.693
whether it's the wave or watching dancing

05:54.695 --> 05:55.526
with their husbands,

05:55.528 --> 05:58.925
it just might not be as
startling as you may think.

05:59.915 --> 06:02.465
So there was Prelutsky, nursing a beer

06:02.467 --> 06:04.403
and surrounded by all these wings.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.763
He was trying to play
cool but it wasn't easy,

06:06.765 --> 06:08.713
I mean we've all seen wings
but they've been attached to

06:08.715 --> 06:11.033
birds and airplanes and hospitals.

06:11.035 --> 06:13.073
Seeing them attached to
a room full of people

06:13.075 --> 06:14.093
is another matter,

06:14.095 --> 06:16.583
he didn't want to be rude and stare,

06:16.585 --> 06:17.935
one can't help but peeping.

06:19.385 --> 06:21.793
I gotta give the guy credit, if it was me,

06:21.795 --> 06:22.873
I would have run out of the joint

06:22.875 --> 06:24.393
and check myself into a mental ward

06:24.395 --> 06:26.723
and had myself checked out by shrinks,

06:26.725 --> 06:28.243
could you imagine being surrounded

06:28.245 --> 06:30.753
by an entire room full of angels.

06:30.755 --> 06:33.143
Not really, I mean,
what makes you think that

06:33.145 --> 06:35.433
he didn't just make it all up?

06:35.435 --> 06:38.505
I met the writer, Prelutsky,
he's not that smart.

06:39.835 --> 06:41.425
Hi, I'm Gabriel.

06:43.155 --> 06:44.173
Am I dead?

06:44.175 --> 06:47.333
No, we are.

06:47.335 --> 06:52.033
Oh, beginning to wonder why
I was seeing so many angels.

06:52.035 --> 06:53.773
Lots of people see angels,

06:53.775 --> 06:56.025
but it's usually just one at a time.

06:57.275 --> 06:58.983
You're a reporter aren't you?

06:58.985 --> 07:00.933
Well how did you know that?

07:00.935 --> 07:03.113
You'd be surprised what we know.

07:03.115 --> 07:06.063
Give me a year and I'll
tell you what happened?

07:06.065 --> 07:07.335
1513.

07:08.635 --> 07:11.583
Yeah, hmmm, nothing.

07:11.585 --> 07:13.183
You don't remember 1513?

07:13.185 --> 07:15.893
Oh I remember it, but
nothing memorable happened,

07:15.895 --> 07:20.193
it was a lot like 762.

07:20.195 --> 07:22.033
Every once in while a year comes along

07:22.035 --> 07:25.393
that is so boring, the
best thing you can do

07:25.395 --> 07:28.273
is lie down and take a nap.

07:28.275 --> 07:31.573
I know what you mean,
I was that way in 1997.

07:31.575 --> 07:34.223
Yeah, that was the snooze.

07:34.225 --> 07:37.223
Ask me about 1398.

07:37.225 --> 07:39.583
What happened in 1398?

07:39.585 --> 07:42.933
Jan Hus was lecturing on
theology at Prague University.

07:42.935 --> 07:44.573
And that made it memorable?

07:44.575 --> 07:46.763
You bet, because Jan Hus

07:46.765 --> 07:50.173
was the most boring speaker in the world.

07:50.175 --> 07:53.503
10 minutes into his talk,
500 people would fall asleep,

07:53.505 --> 07:55.803
if he rehearsed his speech at home,

07:55.805 --> 07:57.383
his dog would fall asleep,

07:57.385 --> 08:00.393
even birds would fall out of a tree.

08:00.395 --> 08:02.183
Gee and I thought Jeff Bush was bad.

08:02.185 --> 08:05.345
I should tell you, you're
not the only writer to stop by.

08:06.195 --> 08:07.026
I'm not.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.383
A lot of guys have been here

08:08.385 --> 08:09.973
but nothings ever gotten published,

08:09.975 --> 08:12.553
Shelley tried it with the signs,

08:12.555 --> 08:14.583
Homer with the Greek tragedy,

08:14.585 --> 08:16.223
I'll tell you what I told them,

08:16.225 --> 08:19.503
it's just a bar, it's a
bar like any other bar

08:19.505 --> 08:22.063
except all the customers are angels,

08:22.065 --> 08:25.823
which means they have
wings but no pockets,

08:25.825 --> 08:27.673
so don't expect a lot of tips.

08:27.675 --> 08:30.413
This is a story that has to be told.

08:30.415 --> 08:32.183
But it's never gonna be published,

08:32.184 --> 08:34.153
they're gonna laugh at you son,

08:34.155 --> 08:38.602
they are gonna say it's unbelievable.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.743
They published The
Bridges of Madison County,

08:40.745 --> 08:41.965
anything is possible.

08:43.995 --> 08:46.883
What's with the black wings,
is that a fashion statement?

08:46.885 --> 08:50.045
Some of the angels think
it makes them look thinner.

08:51.727 --> 08:53.323
And that was the beginning of the story

08:53.325 --> 08:55.283
that changed his life.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.663
On the spot, he immediately
began interviewing

08:57.665 --> 08:58.893
the entire flock of them,

08:58.895 --> 09:01.433
flock being the appropriate
word by the way.

09:01.435 --> 09:04.303
You got a den of thieves, pride of lions

09:04.305 --> 09:05.613
and a flock of angels.

09:05.615 --> 09:07.393
Just in case you ever wake up one morning

09:07.395 --> 09:08.893
and you find yourself on Jeopardy.

09:08.895 --> 09:10.853
In short order he
commandeered a corner table

09:10.855 --> 09:13.003
and let it be known that
the drinks were on him

09:13.005 --> 09:15.143
as long as the angels
answered all of his questions.

09:15.145 --> 09:18.144
He wanted to know who they
were, what their jobs were

09:18.146 --> 09:19.593
and whether or not for the most part

09:19.595 --> 09:21.083
angeling was a good job.

09:21.085 --> 09:22.935
How does one become an angel?

09:24.095 --> 09:27.843
Back in the old days,
I mean God created em,

09:27.845 --> 09:30.453
more or less from whole cloth.

09:30.455 --> 09:35.455
But after people started
began all of that,

09:36.395 --> 09:38.273
the angels couldn't keep up,

09:38.275 --> 09:43.275
so God solved that one by
appointing human beings.

09:43.975 --> 09:45.223
Dead ones.

09:45.225 --> 09:48.243
Yes, that was the one pre-requisite.

09:48.245 --> 09:50.223
So what's the procedure?

09:50.225 --> 09:53.903
Well first you die and then
if your papers are processed,

09:53.905 --> 09:55.653
they'll give you an assignment.

09:55.655 --> 09:57.383
What sort of assignments do you get?

09:57.385 --> 10:01.933
Well most of us are
supposed to look after people,

10:01.935 --> 10:05.211
but only in certain restricted areas.

10:05.213 --> 10:07.443
So you're all specialists.

10:07.445 --> 10:08.603
Exactly.

10:08.605 --> 10:10.893
Do you think your friends
would agree to be interviewed?

10:10.895 --> 10:13.983
I don't see why not,
as long as you're buying,

10:13.985 --> 10:15.643
they talked to all the others.

10:15.645 --> 10:16.745
Who were the others?

10:17.765 --> 10:22.765
Shakespeare, Milton, Twain,
Melville, Poe, Tolstoy,

10:24.105 --> 10:27.185
not to mention Hemingway and Spillane

10:28.635 --> 10:30.453
They all stopped by.

10:30.455 --> 10:31.973
Shakespeare.

10:31.975 --> 10:33.935
Right here at this spot.

10:35.185 --> 10:36.155
Or was that Bacon.

10:37.555 --> 10:39.803
One of those two plum guys.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.393
Two plums?

10:41.395 --> 10:46.313
Yeah one for wearing
and one for writing.

10:46.315 --> 10:49.785
Twain and Belvo, I can't
believe they've all been here.

10:50.635 --> 10:54.833
That's the problem,
nobody could believe it.

10:54.835 --> 10:58.033
They all wrote stuff about us

10:58.035 --> 11:00.363
but they couldn't get it published,

11:00.365 --> 11:04.253
I mean you won't be able to either.

11:04.255 --> 11:06.345
Well don't be too sure about that.

11:06.347 --> 11:11.347
Hey if William Shakespeare
and Mickey Spillane struck out,

11:13.165 --> 11:15.165
what chance do you think you have?

11:16.995 --> 11:18.643
People are a lot more open today

11:18.645 --> 11:19.943
and a lot more broad minded

11:19.945 --> 11:22.003
accepting things they can't see.

11:22.005 --> 11:23.613
Do you mean gullible?

11:23.615 --> 11:24.883
I just mean there's a lot more interest

11:24.885 --> 11:26.653
in the spiritual these days

11:26.655 --> 11:27.713
and people are ready,

11:27.715 --> 11:30.723
even eager to believe in the unbelievable.

11:30.725 --> 11:31.683
I know what you mean,

11:31.685 --> 11:34.365
I've seen some of those TV infomercials.

11:36.495 --> 11:37.355
Name's Wully.

11:38.605 --> 11:40.963
Food and beverage are my line.

11:40.965 --> 11:43.373
I didn't know that heaven
was involved with such things.

11:43.375 --> 11:47.113
Well officially I work for
the food and beverage division

11:47.115 --> 11:48.363
of the health department.

11:48.365 --> 11:50.203
That woman over there by the pool table

11:50.205 --> 11:52.143
running in place is Joyce,

11:52.145 --> 11:53.913
she's the angel of jugging,

11:53.915 --> 11:56.753
and that good looking guy over
there hoggling her is Shawn,

11:56.755 --> 11:58.533
he's the angel of dieting.

11:58.535 --> 12:00.193
Ours is one of the few departments

12:00.195 --> 12:01.903
that's actually expanding.

12:01.905 --> 12:05.473
Right off the top of my head
I'm thinking, Robin Williams,

12:05.475 --> 12:07.663
would be terrific as a
food and beverage guy,

12:07.665 --> 12:10.583
do you remember how funny
he was in Mrs. Doubtliar.

12:10.585 --> 12:12.073
Doubtfire.

12:12.075 --> 12:15.829
And I'm afraid Mr.
Williams died a while back.

12:15.831 --> 12:16.813
Oh.

12:16.815 --> 12:17.648
Yeah.

12:19.775 --> 12:23.553
You miss Variety one week,
you can never catch up.

12:23.555 --> 12:25.593
Hello, what's your name.

12:25.595 --> 12:26.485
Cyrus.

12:27.935 --> 12:29.613
You have something to do with travel.

12:29.615 --> 12:31.573
I've got everything to do with it.

12:31.575 --> 12:33.473
And believe me it's not easy.

12:33.475 --> 12:35.353
What with all the different
timezones, half the time

12:35.355 --> 12:36.903
I don't know if I'm coming or going.

12:36.905 --> 12:38.373
You travel by plane?

12:38.375 --> 12:40.293
No, clouds.

12:40.295 --> 12:43.593
Used to be the best way
to fly, slow, stress free,

12:43.595 --> 12:47.123
you could really stretch out,
you could read on the way.

12:47.125 --> 12:48.593
One trip I read all of Mark Twain,

12:48.595 --> 12:50.123
got half way through Pruist.

12:50.125 --> 12:51.313
What are your duties?

12:51.315 --> 12:54.453
Cars and buses, jet
planes and helicopters,

12:54.455 --> 12:56.073
motorcycles and roller blades.

12:56.075 --> 12:58.503
And as if all that weren't
enough, cigarette boats,

12:58.505 --> 13:01.633
parachutes and bungee
cords, it's all madness.

13:01.635 --> 13:03.843
The trip itself used to be part and parcel

13:03.845 --> 13:05.103
of the travel experience.

13:05.105 --> 13:07.103
People used to voyage and journey.

13:07.105 --> 13:08.753
The very words themselves

13:08.755 --> 13:11.213
suggest an experience of self discovery,

13:11.215 --> 13:15.663
people set sail, they cast
off, they even sally forth.

13:15.665 --> 13:18.583
These days people's idea of a
trip is a ride at a carnival

13:18.585 --> 13:19.733
that combines the west elements

13:19.735 --> 13:22.113
of speed, noise and weightlessness.

13:22.115 --> 13:23.473
Today travel is strictly

13:23.475 --> 13:25.773
a matter of moving from point A to point B

13:25.775 --> 13:28.093
and back to point A in as pointless a way

13:28.095 --> 13:29.623
as mechanically possible.

13:29.625 --> 13:32.503
If someone ever devises a
way to transport human beings

13:32.505 --> 13:34.733
through noematic tubes,
he'll make a fortune.

13:34.735 --> 13:36.093
The casting possible in it

13:36.095 --> 13:37.493
is enough to make my head explode.

13:37.495 --> 13:39.673
I mean this could be another
Around the World in 80 Days

13:39.675 --> 13:43.633
because basically we've
got like, 14 or 15 cameos.

13:43.635 --> 13:45.903
I mean nobody could try to
hold us up for 20 million

13:45.905 --> 13:47.113
when they're only gonna be in the picture

13:47.115 --> 13:49.043
for five or six minutes right,

13:49.045 --> 13:50.295
everyone's gonna want in.

13:52.435 --> 13:54.823
Would you mind
answering a few questions?

13:54.825 --> 13:56.165
Not at all young man.

13:58.475 --> 14:01.593
You seem to be enjoying
that magazine, what is it?

14:01.595 --> 14:02.973
TV Guide.

14:02.975 --> 14:05.013
It's my bible.

14:05.015 --> 14:08.253
You understand that's
just a figure of speech.

14:08.255 --> 14:09.543
You must really enjoy the articles,

14:09.545 --> 14:11.813
I've never realized they were so funny.

14:11.815 --> 14:15.233
I don't read the articles,
I read the listings.

14:15.235 --> 14:18.183
When I read the little blurbs,
they remind of the episode.

14:18.185 --> 14:21.263
Like I was just reading about
this episode of Frasier,

14:21.265 --> 14:24.603
the one where Niles winds up setting fire

14:24.605 --> 14:27.245
to Frasier's favorite couch.

14:41.705 --> 14:45.123
You've memorized every
episode of Frasier?

14:45.125 --> 14:49.223
I've memorized every
episode of every show.

14:49.225 --> 14:50.413
Wow.

14:50.415 --> 14:53.013
Yes, I believe that television

14:53.015 --> 14:55.903
is the greatest invention of all time.

14:55.905 --> 14:59.293
That's why I'm so proud
to be associated with it.

14:59.295 --> 15:02.233
A lot of people regard it
as a terrible waste of time.

15:02.235 --> 15:06.335
Well I think a lot of people
are a terrible waste of time.

15:08.445 --> 15:10.873
What's the best
thing about being an angel?

15:10.875 --> 15:12.273
It's a job.

15:12.275 --> 15:13.883
Is it like being alive though?

15:13.885 --> 15:16.473
Oh yeah, in some cases
it's all the way better.

15:16.475 --> 15:18.253
We never have to punch a clock.

15:18.255 --> 15:20.303
And what's the worst?

15:20.305 --> 15:25.305
No paid vacations, no
bad mouthing management.

15:25.745 --> 15:27.994
Can't you complain to anyone?

15:27.996 --> 15:31.175
Of course, it's a god
given right to gripe,

15:32.035 --> 15:37.035
unfortunately it's a right
that god reserves for himself.

15:39.005 --> 15:42.233
You should hear him when he gets started.

15:42.235 --> 15:45.693
You would think nothing ever
worked out the way he planned.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.155
Really, like what?

15:48.345 --> 15:49.333
You name it.

15:49.335 --> 15:50.243
Sex.

15:50.245 --> 15:52.693
Big mistake, total accident.

15:52.695 --> 15:55.655
I mean Satan completely
blind-sighted him on that one.

15:57.745 --> 16:01.103
The truth, I don't think
god's ever gotten over it.

16:01.105 --> 16:04.513
How did god expect people
to reproduce without sex?

16:04.515 --> 16:07.863
I mean let's face it Horace, without sex,

16:07.865 --> 16:10.833
Adam would have been the
first man and the last man,

16:10.835 --> 16:12.763
I mean surely god didn't
expect human beings

16:12.765 --> 16:15.883
to be a mere footnote in
the history of the universe.

16:15.885 --> 16:17.473
Actually he did.

16:17.475 --> 16:18.306
Really.

16:18.308 --> 16:23.308
Sure, if you ever run
into him, don't bring it up.

16:23.665 --> 16:26.623
I mean learn from my bitter experience,

16:26.625 --> 16:28.829
don't get him started.

16:28.831 --> 16:29.783
According to Horace,

16:29.785 --> 16:33.853
each of you has a specific
area of responsibility,

16:33.855 --> 16:35.123
what's yours?

16:35.125 --> 16:36.773
I'd rather not say.

16:36.775 --> 16:38.263
Why not?

16:38.265 --> 16:40.573
It's embarrassing.

16:40.575 --> 16:44.003
Why don't I tell you something
embarrassing about myself,

16:44.005 --> 16:45.143
then it's your turn.

16:45.145 --> 16:48.795
Fair is fair, my middle name is Beagle,

16:49.965 --> 16:51.135
my mother raised them.

16:53.075 --> 16:57.163
Well you're right Beagle
boy, compared to that

16:57.165 --> 17:00.243
my secret's pretty puny stuff.

17:00.245 --> 17:02.883
I'm responsible for the fine arts.

17:02.885 --> 17:04.663
What's so awful about that?

17:04.665 --> 17:05.925
Just look around you.

17:06.865 --> 17:08.423
In the blink of an eye the world has gone

17:08.425 --> 17:12.032
from Bach and Beethoven to reggae and rap,

17:12.035 --> 17:13.742
we've gone from Run Brand and Da Vinci

17:13.744 --> 17:15.734
to pop art and graffiti,

17:16.595 --> 17:18.165
think how that reflects on me.

17:19.185 --> 17:22.123
How would you feel if
everyone held you responsible

17:22.125 --> 17:24.463
for the fall of western civilization?

17:24.464 --> 17:26.883
Do you have anything to do
with professional wrestlers

17:26.885 --> 17:28.002
or log?

17:28.005 --> 17:29.813
Well not directly but,

17:29.815 --> 17:33.307
nobody I dear say is
immune to my influence.

17:33.309 --> 17:34.393
Oh really?

17:34.395 --> 17:38.143
Oh yes, I'm Lydia the angel of romance.

17:38.145 --> 17:41.533
At least romance used to be my field.

17:41.535 --> 17:45.183
Now of course it's faded
away like an old rose,

17:45.185 --> 17:47.453
pressed between the pages of a diary.

17:47.455 --> 17:48.835
It's really so sad.

17:49.675 --> 17:54.263
Keltrastess, in olden
days, romance meant a lover

17:54.265 --> 17:57.863
scaling walls, or slaying
dragons of one sort or another

17:57.865 --> 18:01.003
and pledging himself to his true love.

18:01.005 --> 18:02.093
Are you talking about chivalry,

18:02.095 --> 18:04.293
isn't that a bit old fashioned.

18:04.295 --> 18:08.003
And what sir is outdated
about eternal bliss?

18:08.005 --> 18:09.943
What's uncomfortable about lovers

18:09.945 --> 18:11.913
pledging their troth to one another?

18:11.915 --> 18:12.855
Their what?

18:13.885 --> 18:14.793
That's another thing,

18:14.795 --> 18:16.833
people used to know what troth meant.

18:16.835 --> 18:20.173
Now their lawyers hammer out pre-nuptials.

18:20.175 --> 18:22.753
Once upon a time we had soulmates

18:22.755 --> 18:24.853
and two hearts that beat as one.

18:24.855 --> 18:26.953
Now they're significant others.

18:26.955 --> 18:30.513
Men snooker about hooshers
and women giggle about butts.

18:30.515 --> 18:33.903
How can romance flourish
when you treat one another

18:33.905 --> 18:37.583
like so many interchangeable
body parts like Chevys

18:37.585 --> 18:38.835
or the Colonel's Chicken.

18:40.605 --> 18:42.113
Uncle Sydney.

18:42.115 --> 18:44.863
I'm afraid not sunny
boy, my handle's Harry.

18:44.865 --> 18:46.313
I did know an Uncle Sydney once

18:46.315 --> 18:48.173
but he was my uncle, not yours.

18:48.175 --> 18:50.963
It's just that you look so familiar.

18:50.965 --> 18:54.343
I think I look a bit like
Ziegfeld, a little taller,

18:54.345 --> 18:55.833
better looking with wings.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.573
I'm thinking maybe George Clooney,

18:58.575 --> 18:59.583
he's pretty cool isn't he.

18:59.585 --> 19:02.263
Oh yeah very cool, he
also has very nice hair.

19:02.265 --> 19:05.373
Again with the hair, just listen.

19:05.375 --> 19:07.315
What is your job Harry.

19:08.505 --> 19:10.605
What job don't I have, I've done it all.

19:11.545 --> 19:14.533
Best of all I've done it my way.

19:14.535 --> 19:18.303
I invented show business, it's my life,

19:18.305 --> 19:20.333
or at least it would be if I had a life.

19:20.335 --> 19:22.370
Before me, people knew there was something

19:22.372 --> 19:23.373
missing in their lives

19:23.375 --> 19:24.703
but they didn't know what.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.023
They sat around for hours on end on rocks,

19:27.025 --> 19:28.451
scratching and moaning.

19:28.453 --> 19:29.523
Well how did you go about it.

19:29.525 --> 19:30.793
Well I began with the women,

19:30.795 --> 19:32.162
every night I'll get them to go up

19:32.164 --> 19:33.473
to their husbands and say,

19:33.475 --> 19:36.233
you never take me out, we
never do anything together.

19:36.235 --> 19:39.053
Within a week, Harry,
the first entertainer,

19:39.055 --> 19:40.003
was packing them in.

19:40.005 --> 19:41.593
Doing what?

19:41.595 --> 19:44.493
Harry used to throw 19 rocks
in the air at the same time.

19:44.495 --> 19:46.423
And that's how we got joggling?

19:46.425 --> 19:48.713
No that's how you got
dodging and ducking.

19:48.715 --> 19:49.973
Joggling came along much later,

19:49.975 --> 19:51.523
it involved three oranges.

19:51.525 --> 19:54.063
My name is Minerva young man,

19:54.065 --> 19:57.183
and my field of expertise,
if I might call it that

19:57.185 --> 20:00.203
without appearing immodest, is athletics.

20:00.205 --> 20:01.543
I would have never guessed.

20:01.545 --> 20:04.243
Actually, I'm relatively new to the job.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.913
Formerly, I was in charge
of what used to be known

20:06.915 --> 20:08.903
as the social graces.

20:08.905 --> 20:11.633
But there has been less and
less call for my services

20:11.635 --> 20:16.023
until finally I was as
redundant as an appendix.

20:16.025 --> 20:17.353
Well what happened?

20:17.355 --> 20:19.693
I was hoping you would tell me.

20:19.695 --> 20:23.193
All I know is that etiquette
used to be quite important,

20:23.195 --> 20:26.523
and then one day it wasn't.

20:26.525 --> 20:31.525
My name is Alexander,
please don't call me Alex.

20:31.785 --> 20:35.033
You wouldn't possibly
know a 37 letter word

20:35.035 --> 20:37.903
for Villeinage, would you?

20:37.905 --> 20:39.533
No I don't.

20:39.535 --> 20:40.993
I didn't expect you to.

20:40.995 --> 20:44.693
Let me be so bold, you
seem a bit dispirited.

20:44.695 --> 20:47.283
Certainly discouraged.

20:47.285 --> 20:49.603
Not the crossword puzzle is it?

20:49.605 --> 20:52.503
Hardly, the 'cause for my lethrege

20:52.505 --> 20:55.925
is that for all intents and purposes,

20:57.113 --> 20:59.443
I've been out of work for 60 years.

20:59.445 --> 21:01.223
Well that's a problem.

21:01.225 --> 21:04.143
What is it that you do or did?

21:04.145 --> 21:07.333
My job was guiding geniuses.

21:07.335 --> 21:11.435
Hence I've been unemployed
since April 18, 1955.

21:12.735 --> 21:14.143
What happened on that date?

21:14.145 --> 21:15.125
Einstein died.

21:16.805 --> 21:18.273
I guess you're a happy angel.

21:18.275 --> 21:21.913
Oh why is that? Do you
know something I don't?

21:21.915 --> 21:23.943
Well I thought that
although romance and the arts

21:23.945 --> 21:25.703
might have been going to the dogs

21:25.705 --> 21:29.023
that you can't knock modern technology?

21:29.025 --> 21:30.983
You can't, not if you
know what's good for you.

21:30.985 --> 21:33.113
It could knock back and really hurt you.

21:33.115 --> 21:35.113
You're not a fan of progress.

21:35.115 --> 21:36.823
Do you realize they
now have a lethal gas

21:36.825 --> 21:38.713
you can't see or smell.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.443
With just two ounces,

21:40.445 --> 21:42.795
you could wipe Southern
California off the map.

21:44.885 --> 21:46.783
I see you're smiling.

21:46.785 --> 21:48.253
Just visualizing.

21:48.255 --> 21:50.703
Be that as it may, Mr. Wisenheimer,

21:50.705 --> 21:53.533
my point is that one man's progress

21:53.535 --> 21:56.043
is another man's poisoned gas.

21:56.045 --> 21:58.053
What a very good point it is.

21:58.055 --> 22:01.563
Where did we go wrong, how
could we have been so blind?

22:01.565 --> 22:03.713
It wasn't our fault George.

22:03.715 --> 22:05.033
We were darn fools.

22:05.035 --> 22:08.763
We were no such thing,
we were idealists.

22:08.765 --> 22:11.253
Why are you being so hard on yourselves?

22:11.255 --> 22:15.003
Don't blame us, god knows we tried.

22:15.005 --> 22:17.183
There there dear, I'm
sure the nice gentlemen

22:17.185 --> 22:19.653
realizes that we did the best we can.

22:19.655 --> 22:21.233
More is the pity.

22:21.235 --> 22:24.343
Please excuse us, it's just
that when we started out,

22:24.345 --> 22:26.743
we had such high hopes for the future,

22:26.745 --> 22:28.893
we actually believed
there could be such things

22:28.895 --> 22:30.863
as perfect nurturing parents.

22:30.865 --> 22:33.293
And don't forget those
wonderful loving tots.

22:33.295 --> 22:34.983
We believed in them too.

22:34.985 --> 22:36.235
What is it that you do?

22:37.225 --> 22:38.685
We oversee parenting.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.513
Anyone could see our next subject

22:41.515 --> 22:44.113
was trying to drown his
sorrows and possibly himself

22:44.115 --> 22:45.973
at the rate he was
downing shots ,

22:45.975 --> 22:47.673
it was as if he was trying to finish off

22:47.675 --> 22:49.703
the work began decades earlier

22:49.705 --> 22:51.613
by carrying nation

22:51.615 --> 22:54.323
but instead of waging on boos
by shutting down distilleries

22:54.325 --> 22:57.193
through the 18th amendment, or sing an ax

22:57.195 --> 22:59.223
to break bar tops into kibbling,

22:59.225 --> 23:03.725
he was on a one man mission to
deplete the entire bar stock.

23:12.445 --> 23:13.395
What's your name?

23:17.225 --> 23:19.443
Who told you to sit down?

23:19.445 --> 23:20.445
You were sleeping.

23:21.815 --> 23:25.943
Well wake me up next time, my name's Al,

23:25.945 --> 23:30.945
actually it's, Aloicious Jailmally,

23:31.065 --> 23:32.973
my friends call me Swifty,

23:32.975 --> 23:34.652
at least that's what they used to call me

23:34.654 --> 23:36.519
when I still had friends.

23:36.521 --> 23:37.521
They died?

23:38.720 --> 23:39.637
They did.

23:42.335 --> 23:43.673
Any of them here.

23:43.675 --> 23:48.675
I'm afraid not, none of my boys made it.

23:48.935 --> 23:52.543
Actually I guess I'm lucky
to have snuck through.

23:52.545 --> 23:53.663
You were a politician.

23:53.665 --> 23:58.665
No, no no no, I was
what you call an arranger.

23:59.225 --> 24:04.113
I helped arrange it for
other people to get elected.

24:04.115 --> 24:05.753
And now?

24:05.755 --> 24:10.243
Well my official duties
are to oversee politics,

24:10.245 --> 24:12.673
but mainly what I do is overlook.

24:12.675 --> 24:13.523
Overlook.

24:13.525 --> 24:16.173
As an angel I try to guide them,

24:16.175 --> 24:19.925
encourage them to do the right thing.

24:21.875 --> 24:26.153
Did you ever hear such a
flap doodle in all your life.

24:26.155 --> 24:27.783
We all want to have representatives

24:27.785 --> 24:29.383
in congress and in the white house

24:29.385 --> 24:31.703
that we can respect and look up to.

24:31.705 --> 24:35.183
The only politician the
people should look up to

24:35.185 --> 24:37.705
is the one that's
hanging from the gallows.

24:39.825 --> 24:42.153
Finally a cheerful angel.

24:42.155 --> 24:43.123
Well indeed I am,

24:43.125 --> 24:44.843
do you suppose that's because I only deal

24:44.845 --> 24:46.313
indirectly with humans?

24:46.315 --> 24:47.433
Who do you deal with?

24:47.435 --> 24:49.263
Why dogs of course.

24:49.265 --> 24:50.340
Dogs.

24:50.342 --> 24:53.619
Of course, why do
you sound so surprised.

24:53.621 --> 24:56.113
I never imagined that poodles
would have their own angel.

24:56.115 --> 24:57.743
Well isn't that like a human being,

24:57.745 --> 25:01.263
to think that heaven is more
about them than their pets.

25:01.265 --> 25:03.263
They're just poor dumb creatures.

25:03.265 --> 25:05.223
Oh I know,

25:05.225 --> 25:08.613
that's why we always try to
make allowances for people.

25:08.615 --> 25:11.163
I was talking about the dogs.

25:11.165 --> 25:12.223
I know.

25:12.225 --> 25:13.293
What about Meryl Streep.

25:13.295 --> 25:14.463
Oh what about her?

25:14.465 --> 25:15.296
Is she alive?

25:15.298 --> 25:16.433
Oh yes yes, she's alive.

25:16.435 --> 25:18.213
She'd be terrific as a dog angel.

25:18.215 --> 25:20.183
Yeah oh my, she's always terrific.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.913
Basically, we'll be guaranteed

25:21.915 --> 25:23.383
at least one Oscar nomination,

25:23.385 --> 25:25.913
I mean the lady sneezes
and she gets nominated.

25:25.915 --> 25:27.053
That is so true.

25:27.055 --> 25:29.541
What do you do for relaxation?

25:29.543 --> 25:31.373
Once in a while I do go rainbow sliding.

25:31.375 --> 25:32.383
What's that like?

25:32.385 --> 25:34.733
They're like those water
slides at the theme parks,

25:34.735 --> 25:35.993
except we don't have to buy tickets

25:35.995 --> 25:37.473
or stand in line all day.

25:37.475 --> 25:40.143
Didn't even realize
they had TV in heaven.

25:40.145 --> 25:42.583
It wouldn't be heaven without it.

25:42.585 --> 25:46.023
The only problem is some
angels don't feel that way.

25:46.025 --> 25:47.743
So I often have to mute it.

25:47.745 --> 25:49.353
That must make it hard on you?

25:49.355 --> 25:51.793
Fortunately I can read lips,

25:51.795 --> 25:55.023
besides they're mostly re-runs,
so I've seen them before.

25:55.025 --> 25:56.863
How many times have you
seen the Frasier episode

25:56.865 --> 25:58.783
that you were just reading about.

25:58.785 --> 26:00.773
Roughly 400 times

26:00.775 --> 26:03.663
but it just keeps getting
better and better.

26:03.665 --> 26:06.393
I guess it's because I'm getting to know

26:06.395 --> 26:08.763
the characters so well.

26:08.765 --> 26:12.093
I think I love Roz best of all.

26:12.095 --> 26:15.673
What forms of entertainment
are most popular in heaven?

26:15.675 --> 26:19.053
Usual things, Celetial
Quaz, Hop Concerts,

26:19.055 --> 26:21.713
lots of re-runs of I Love Lucy.

26:21.715 --> 26:25.023
What do you think of
the television medium?

26:25.025 --> 26:28.593
Well to quote the
great arch-angel Frenal,

26:28.595 --> 26:32.123
they call it a medium
because it's never done well.

26:32.125 --> 26:34.853
What form of entertainment
do you enjoy the most.

26:34.855 --> 26:37.745
Well in my book you
can't beat modern film.

26:39.325 --> 26:44.325
I mean dog acts, Ventrocus,
Tumblers, Arge Comics,

26:44.445 --> 26:48.003
German Comics, Sister
Acts, Barbershop, Quartets,

26:48.005 --> 26:50.213
the whole razzmatazz,
before that all you had

26:50.215 --> 26:53.243
was wandering minstrels and court jesters.

26:53.245 --> 26:56.363
Give me a dog that dances
on its hind legs anytime.

26:56.365 --> 26:57.913
Perhaps just well,

26:57.915 --> 27:00.123
but how much real
satisfaction can there be

27:00.125 --> 27:03.123
in overseeing the affairs of
creatures who pee on trees

27:03.125 --> 27:04.663
and go pop.

27:04.665 --> 27:09.263
And who are fearless,
loving, gentle and loyal

27:09.265 --> 27:11.473
and who don't start wars,

27:11.475 --> 27:14.273
lie, cheat or betray their friends,

27:14.275 --> 27:15.893
whose simple goodness

27:15.895 --> 27:19.733
and piety is an example for the saints,

27:19.735 --> 27:23.673
and yet here you sit truly
astonished by the fact that,

27:23.675 --> 27:26.343
we all have a special place
in our hearts for them,

27:26.345 --> 27:29.853
see I find that totally astonishing.

27:29.855 --> 27:32.603
And it may further shock you to know

27:32.605 --> 27:35.123
that their place in heaven is secure

27:35.125 --> 27:38.093
while the human race
is skating on thin ice.

27:38.095 --> 27:39.953
I never imagined.

27:39.955 --> 27:43.203
Well that's because it's
not their way to brag.

27:43.205 --> 27:48.043
Here on earth even, when a dog
wins a race or a blue ribbon,

27:48.045 --> 27:50.563
he doesn't hug the limelight,

27:50.565 --> 27:53.513
he's very willing to share
the glory with his people.

27:53.515 --> 27:55.653
So it's basically
been your responsibility

27:55.655 --> 27:58.385
to wean us off of bark and onto burgers.

27:59.405 --> 28:01.873
It's not as easy as it sounds.

28:01.875 --> 28:03.923
You people talk about developing a taste

28:03.925 --> 28:06.153
for olives and grand flakes

28:06.155 --> 28:08.143
but can you imagine how long it took me

28:08.145 --> 28:11.943
to convince the very first
person to try a lobster?

28:11.945 --> 28:14.873
plus keep in mind that butter
hadn't been invented yet.

28:14.875 --> 28:17.693
I bet it was even harder
to get us onto snails.

28:17.695 --> 28:19.653
I got lucky on that one.

28:19.655 --> 28:20.653
Butter or no butter,

28:20.655 --> 28:23.233
at the rate those little
rascals reproduce,

28:23.235 --> 28:25.793
if some French gardener
hadn't had a brainstorm

28:25.795 --> 28:28.213
and decided to call them escargot,

28:28.215 --> 28:30.333
you'd be buried in by now.

28:30.335 --> 28:32.923
How'd you like to coax
someone into trying yogurt

28:32.925 --> 28:35.073
before the stuff even had a name.

28:35.075 --> 28:36.503
How'd you manage?

28:36.505 --> 28:39.873
I found this lost soul
wandering in the Gobi Desert

28:39.875 --> 28:43.315
for two weeks, dining
on sand in his sneakers.

28:45.005 --> 28:48.733
Even at that, it took another
five days before he caved in.

28:48.735 --> 28:51.453
And are you telling me that
there's no other geniuses.

28:51.455 --> 28:52.833
Nothing much to speak off.

28:52.835 --> 28:54.073
Find that hard to believe.

28:54.075 --> 28:55.493
Of course you do.

28:55.495 --> 28:58.243
That's because human beings
throw the word around

28:58.245 --> 29:00.643
as recklessly as rice at a wedding.

29:00.645 --> 29:04.023
By actual count in the
history of the world,

29:04.025 --> 29:06.213
there have been nine geniuses.

29:06.215 --> 29:08.803
But, if you believe say People Magazine,

29:08.805 --> 29:11.493
they're as plentiful as
flees on a bloodhound.

29:11.495 --> 29:14.443
Everyone who ever directed
a movie that turned a profit

29:14.445 --> 29:17.103
or been a lawyer for a celebrity criminal

29:17.105 --> 29:19.203
or made a financial killing on Wall Street

29:19.205 --> 29:22.043
or made the cover of
People for that matter,

29:22.045 --> 29:23.653
qualifies for their pantheon.

29:23.655 --> 29:25.263
As it is, the last person

29:25.265 --> 29:28.893
who actually saught creative
inspiration was Andy Warhol,

29:28.895 --> 29:31.083
I'm afraid he misunderstood
when I told him

29:31.085 --> 29:32.483
that to be a great artist,

29:32.485 --> 29:35.313
he might have to eat
Campbell soup to survive.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.153
If it has you so upset,

29:37.155 --> 29:38.803
why don't you do something about it.

29:38.805 --> 29:43.805
I am a muse and clearly you
are unaware of a muse's role.

29:44.690 --> 29:47.543
What happened? Get all mused out?

29:47.545 --> 29:49.573
It's you people.

29:49.575 --> 29:52.223
You stopped wanting to
be divinely inspired,

29:52.225 --> 29:54.123
writers stopped writing great novels

29:54.125 --> 29:56.323
and started writing bad TV shows.

29:56.325 --> 29:59.263
Composers lost interest in symphonies

29:59.265 --> 30:03.493
and concentrated on jingles
selling soap and potato chips.

30:03.495 --> 30:07.683
Architects stopped designing
cathedrals like Notre Dame

30:07.685 --> 30:10.583
and started designing
towers like Notre Trump.

30:10.585 --> 30:12.993
There used to be hundreds of
us in the Arts Department,

30:12.995 --> 30:14.643
it was thrilling.

30:14.645 --> 30:17.153
More than a mere job, it was a calling.

30:17.155 --> 30:22.013
Every time you turned around,
voila, another masterpiece.

30:22.015 --> 30:23.453
What happened?

30:23.455 --> 30:25.403
What always happens.

30:25.405 --> 30:27.883
Funding for the Arts dries up.

30:27.885 --> 30:31.743
The usual cut backs take
place and here I am,

30:31.745 --> 30:34.725
Helen, the lone surviving muse.

30:37.435 --> 30:39.933
Every time I read
that chapter I break up.

30:39.935 --> 30:42.803
Everything she says is so darn true.

30:42.805 --> 30:45.303
Don't you realize she's
talking about people like you,

30:45.305 --> 30:48.253
people who produce movies
like Wuthering Heights

30:48.255 --> 30:50.753
and the Wild Women of Waterloo.

30:50.755 --> 30:52.103
Of course I realize that,

30:52.105 --> 30:53.743
that's why I had to make
the ultimate sacrifice

30:53.745 --> 30:56.843
and sell my Monets and my
Susannies and my Dailies.

30:56.845 --> 30:59.873
That's why I have to have
my name on Angels on Tap,

30:59.875 --> 31:01.233
don't you understand?

31:01.235 --> 31:03.515
I'm trying to save my soul.

31:04.865 --> 31:06.903
Do you miss the old days?

31:06.905 --> 31:07.738
I sure do.

31:08.945 --> 31:11.273
If only we can turn the clock back.

31:11.275 --> 31:13.843
Ever relaxing carriage rides, train trips,

31:13.845 --> 31:16.213
long sea voyages, and on occasion,

31:16.215 --> 31:18.693
an exhilarating gallop across the meadow.

31:18.695 --> 31:22.033
Once in a great while, for a
refreshing change of scenery,

31:22.035 --> 31:23.713
a scent in a hot hair balloon.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.603
Today you get hit with
so many rushed jobs,

31:25.605 --> 31:27.893
we're all on shooting stars.

31:27.895 --> 31:30.013
I'll never forget the
day the wheel was invented.

31:30.015 --> 31:32.305
There was such excitement.

31:33.355 --> 31:35.043
Did they have any
idea what to do with it?

31:35.045 --> 31:36.393
None whatsoever.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.753
That's what made it so exciting.

31:38.755 --> 31:40.753
Everyone sensed they
were onto something big

31:40.755 --> 31:42.443
but they had no idea what.

31:42.445 --> 31:44.563
Was it one person
who made the discovery.

31:44.565 --> 31:47.143
Of course, it's always one person.

31:47.145 --> 31:49.303
As soon as you get a
second person in the room,

31:49.305 --> 31:52.473
all he'll do is tell the first
person to stop horsing around

31:52.475 --> 31:54.113
and get a real job.

31:54.115 --> 31:56.543
So who was it that discovered the wheel?

31:56.545 --> 31:58.043
It was a guy named Benny.

31:58.045 --> 32:01.043
He was just fooling around
one day with different shapes.

32:01.045 --> 32:04.103
It's very fortunate he
finally came up with round.

32:04.105 --> 32:05.283
What do you mean?

32:05.285 --> 32:08.085
Well for the longest time
he got hung up on triangles.

32:09.065 --> 32:12.875
Can you imagine driving around
on four steel rim triangles.

32:14.195 --> 32:15.323
I guess you could say that

32:15.325 --> 32:18.473
we were just a bunch of
general practitioners.

32:18.475 --> 32:21.603
Back then, there wasn't a lot of trouble

32:21.605 --> 32:24.003
that people could get into.

32:24.005 --> 32:27.503
So, just as long as they
didn't mix it up with witches

32:27.505 --> 32:29.083
and they remembered to say their prayers

32:29.085 --> 32:32.543
30 or 40 times a day, the job was a sab.

32:32.545 --> 32:34.423
What did it consist of?

32:34.425 --> 32:36.723
Mostly hovering.

32:36.725 --> 32:37.558
Hovering?

32:39.220 --> 32:42.873
You've seen it in all
the pagans, like cat.

32:42.875 --> 32:43.985
We hovered a lot.

32:45.515 --> 32:49.303
Whenever anybody important
was born, there we were

32:49.305 --> 32:50.465
hovering over him.

32:52.135 --> 32:55.783
Likewise, when they died, I mean,

32:55.785 --> 32:58.783
we'd show up at weddings and crucifixions

32:58.785 --> 33:00.995
and most of your bigger shit takes.

33:01.915 --> 33:03.003
Can you tell me about

33:03.005 --> 33:05.703
some of the great painters you have known?

33:05.705 --> 33:09.003
Well I hate to drop names but perhaps

33:09.005 --> 33:10.983
you've heard of Michael Angelo.

33:10.985 --> 33:13.435
I imagine he's one of
the greatest of them all.

33:14.285 --> 33:15.823
Certainly the laziest.

33:15.825 --> 33:17.293
How can you say that?

33:17.295 --> 33:20.353
A lazy man painted the
ceiling of the Sistine Chapel?

33:20.355 --> 33:22.973
He only took the job because
he could do it lying down.

33:22.975 --> 33:25.283
Still it was a tremendous achievement,

33:25.285 --> 33:27.613
didn't it take him four or five years.

33:27.615 --> 33:30.303
Of course, that's
because he kept napping.

33:30.305 --> 33:33.443
Anyone else would have had it
finished in two weeks tops.

33:33.445 --> 33:36.593
Frankly, in all honesty, I have to admit,

33:36.595 --> 33:38.673
I outdid myself that time.

33:38.675 --> 33:39.933
How so?

33:39.935 --> 33:42.383
Maybe you think it's easy being museful,

33:42.385 --> 33:44.273
when every time you
come around, the artist

33:44.275 --> 33:48.463
is 200 feet up in the
air, snoring like a bear.

33:48.465 --> 33:52.053
I am amazed that you have
to oversee all the fine arts.

33:52.055 --> 33:55.622
I would think that painters
alone would keep you happy.

33:55.624 --> 33:57.783
Hoping mad.

33:57.785 --> 34:00.013
Somewhere along the
line the art of painting

34:00.015 --> 34:01.913
turned into the art of framing.

34:01.915 --> 34:05.443
People put frames around
dots and drips and smudges

34:05.445 --> 34:07.443
and the stuff sells for millions.

34:07.445 --> 34:09.922
Without the fancy frames,
they're the sort of things

34:09.925 --> 34:11.523
that parents of very young children

34:11.525 --> 34:14.342
attach to their refrigerators
with little magnets.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.063
You know our biggest mistake?

34:16.065 --> 34:17.643
Was letting parents
keep the children around

34:17.645 --> 34:19.773
even after the children
were bigger than they are.

34:19.775 --> 34:21.193
It breaks down the natural order of things

34:21.195 --> 34:22.632
when a parent gives a command

34:22.635 --> 34:24.672
and the child is like, oh yeah,

34:24.675 --> 34:28.483
who's gonna make me, or worst
of all, you and who else?

34:28.485 --> 34:31.002
Sounds like you're
talking about teenagers.

34:31.004 --> 34:34.842
Oh the awful T word, try not to say it.

34:34.844 --> 34:36.643
It's a modern aberration you know.

34:36.645 --> 34:38.882
Both the word and the thing itself,

34:38.885 --> 34:40.822
they're an offense to mother nature.

34:40.824 --> 34:43.663
Kind of like a butterfly
turning back into larvae.

34:43.665 --> 34:46.003
But haven't we always had teenagers?

34:46.005 --> 34:47.253
Of course not?

34:47.255 --> 34:49.503
But how can it be avoided.

34:49.505 --> 34:51.072
In those happier days there was simply

34:51.074 --> 34:52.922
no such thing as a teenager.

34:52.925 --> 34:53.833
You went straight from being

34:53.835 --> 34:56.803
an adorable little six year
old to a very short coal miner.

34:56.804 --> 34:59.793
I always say there's nothing
like a 16 hour work day

34:59.795 --> 35:01.143
to keep the young tikes out of mischief,

35:01.145 --> 35:03.113
if you know what I mean.

35:03.115 --> 35:04.333
What are your duties?

35:04.335 --> 35:07.133
Well let's just say if
it weren't for Old Wully,

35:07.135 --> 35:09.443
people would still be gnashing on twigs,

35:09.445 --> 35:12.133
grass and small rodents.

35:12.135 --> 35:13.633
When you put it that way,

35:13.635 --> 35:16.273
I guess I owe you a pretty large debt.

35:16.275 --> 35:17.803
I'd say so.

35:17.805 --> 35:20.823
Though I actually feel mice
were considered delicacies

35:20.825 --> 35:23.113
until just recently.

35:23.115 --> 35:25.583
Heck fella, it wasn't that
long ago that you folks

35:25.585 --> 35:28.413
gobbled up acorns like
they were bear nuts.

35:28.415 --> 35:29.993
Well what has changed?

35:29.995 --> 35:32.813
It was decided that there
weren't enough differences

35:32.815 --> 35:34.453
to distinguish human beings

35:34.455 --> 35:38.553
from owls and bears and wild boars

35:38.555 --> 35:42.033
and that perhaps diet might
be an area worth exploring.

35:42.035 --> 35:43.583
Who was the greatest genius.

35:43.585 --> 35:45.153
Well that's easy, it was Ag.

35:45.155 --> 35:46.143
Never heard of him.

35:46.145 --> 35:47.313
Of course you didn't,

35:47.315 --> 35:49.633
for one thing he never
made the cover of People

35:49.635 --> 35:52.213
and for another he was quite
a while before your time,

35:52.215 --> 35:54.693
several million years before.

35:54.695 --> 35:56.443
What made him such a genius?

35:56.445 --> 35:58.693
He invented the alphabet.

35:58.695 --> 36:00.853
That's quite an accomplishment.

36:00.855 --> 36:04.513
It was even better before he
caved in to outside pressure.

36:04.515 --> 36:05.663
What happened?

36:05.665 --> 36:08.513
He had a wife who
thought she was creative.

36:08.515 --> 36:11.653
Q, X and Z were her ideas.

36:11.655 --> 36:13.443
So Ag compromised.

36:13.445 --> 36:14.276
Well it was either that

36:14.278 --> 36:17.023
or sleep outside with the Tyrannosaurus.

36:17.025 --> 36:18.873
Genius is a demanding mistress

36:18.875 --> 36:21.553
but it's nothing compared to a pushy wife.

36:21.555 --> 36:23.142
I had a wife like Ag's.

36:23.144 --> 36:24.073
In what way?

36:24.075 --> 36:25.563
Pushy.

36:25.565 --> 36:27.155
Mrs. Bachman number one.

36:28.175 --> 36:30.773
And that divorce cost me
almost as much as this book,

36:30.775 --> 36:32.705
but it was money well spent.

36:32.707 --> 36:33.866
How so?

36:33.868 --> 36:35.433
It taught me that marrying someone

36:35.435 --> 36:37.573
just because they look good on your rom

36:37.575 --> 36:39.543
is a lousy reason to get married.

36:39.545 --> 36:41.043
Much better to go out and buy something

36:41.045 --> 36:42.673
that looks good on your wall.

36:42.675 --> 36:43.845
Like a Suzani.

36:44.815 --> 36:46.013
Yeah.

36:46.015 --> 36:48.793
When did things start
to go downhill for you?

36:48.795 --> 36:50.073
After Edison.

36:50.075 --> 36:52.663
I'd have to say it stopped being fun.

36:52.665 --> 36:54.103
You admired Edison?

36:54.105 --> 36:55.505
He flabbergasted me.

36:56.375 --> 37:00.053
He had a brain on him the
size of a bowling ball.

37:00.055 --> 37:02.823
They say the legs are the first to go,

37:02.825 --> 37:05.103
but if you got a brain like Edison's,

37:05.105 --> 37:06.513
it's the neck.

37:06.515 --> 37:08.443
I take it that you've
been on a first name basis

37:08.445 --> 37:10.303
with some of the biggest
brains in history.

37:10.305 --> 37:13.665
Is there any one moment
that stands out for you?

37:14.595 --> 37:15.426
No.

37:15.428 --> 37:17.033
Come on, there must be something.

37:17.035 --> 37:19.173
I mean the supper where Socrates

37:19.175 --> 37:21.013
expanded on the meaning of love,

37:21.015 --> 37:23.513
the day Shakespeare
drafted Hamlet's Soliloquy,

37:23.515 --> 37:25.583
Isaac Newton's discovery of gravity.

37:25.585 --> 37:28.083
What you think, Newton
was one of the nine?

37:28.085 --> 37:29.743
Well I assumed.

37:29.745 --> 37:33.333
The man was just lucky he
fell asleep under an apple tree.

37:33.335 --> 37:34.613
If it had been a palm tree,

37:34.615 --> 37:36.603
a coconut could have fallen on his head.

37:36.605 --> 37:37.653
And let me tell you,

37:37.655 --> 37:39.513
fella gets beaten by one of those babies,

37:39.515 --> 37:41.953
his big concern isn't
with the laws of nature,

37:41.955 --> 37:43.853
it's his health insurance.

37:43.855 --> 37:46.397
Still, he discovered gravity.

37:46.399 --> 37:49.713
He didn't discover it,
all he did was name it.

37:49.715 --> 37:51.193
What, you think he was the first person

37:51.195 --> 37:53.803
who ever noticed things didn't fall up?

37:53.805 --> 37:57.893
One idea that really knocked
me for a loop was the car.

37:57.895 --> 37:59.503
I still can't get over it.

37:59.505 --> 38:01.383
You mean the internal combustion engine.

38:01.385 --> 38:03.375
Oh good gracious no.

38:04.245 --> 38:05.833
That's just noisy and messy.

38:05.835 --> 38:08.423
I mean what made the fellow plunge ahead?

38:08.425 --> 38:10.593
How could he possibly imagine that others

38:10.595 --> 38:13.203
were going to invent paved roads,

38:13.205 --> 38:17.333
signals, street lights,
speed bumps, gas stations,

38:17.335 --> 38:19.913
tow trucks, and those big fuzzy dice,

38:19.915 --> 38:24.915
just to accommodate his
nutsy notion, what an ego.

38:25.125 --> 38:27.483
With an ego that enormous, you half expect

38:27.485 --> 38:29.783
to see a bunch of guys named Lars

38:29.785 --> 38:33.023
climbing up and planting a flag on it.

38:33.025 --> 38:34.433
I imagine that you've met

38:34.435 --> 38:36.723
all the greatest artists that ever lived.

38:36.725 --> 38:40.653
I knew them all, except for Roca.

38:40.655 --> 38:42.073
Who is Roca?

38:42.075 --> 38:44.503
He was the first one
to do cave drawings.

38:44.505 --> 38:48.315
By the time I realized it
was art and not vandalism,

38:49.155 --> 38:50.593
it was too late to meet him.

38:50.595 --> 38:52.623
Why, what happened?

38:52.625 --> 38:55.303
A dinosaur ate him for breakfast.

38:55.305 --> 38:57.943
And so art criticism was born.

38:57.945 --> 39:00.503
Who was the first professional comedian?

39:00.505 --> 39:04.313
The first professional
comedian was Henry Youngfellow

39:04.315 --> 39:06.503
but his career didn't last long.

39:06.505 --> 39:08.963
Every other line out of his mouth was,

39:08.965 --> 39:11.293
Pretty, taketh thee my wife.

39:11.295 --> 39:14.473
I always thought that court
jesters lived by their wits?

39:14.475 --> 39:15.793
In a sense they did.

39:15.795 --> 39:18.453
Their job, you see, was
to fall down laughing

39:18.455 --> 39:20.273
every time the king made a joke.

39:20.275 --> 39:22.673
The louder the laughed,
the longer they lived.

39:22.675 --> 39:24.103
That's why people started thinking

39:24.105 --> 39:26.123
that laughing was good for your health.

39:26.125 --> 39:28.343
Weren't any of the jesters funny?

39:28.345 --> 39:30.593
Well some laughed
funnier than the others.

39:30.595 --> 39:33.703
But even the jester known
as Agus the Hilarious,

39:33.705 --> 39:35.373
never had a better line than,

39:35.375 --> 39:38.675
she is no lady, she is Lord
Hashford's wife.

39:42.875 --> 39:46.463
Who do you regard as
the greatest romantics?

39:46.465 --> 39:49.443
One who readily comes
to mind is Shah Jahan

39:49.445 --> 39:52.323
who built the Taj Mahal as a mausoleum,

39:52.325 --> 39:56.473
when his wife, the lovely
Mumtaz Mahal passed away.

39:56.475 --> 39:59.313
Well the Taj Mahal
was a heck of a gesture.

39:59.315 --> 40:02.203
But nothing compared to the Taj Shirley.

40:02.205 --> 40:05.043
The Taj Shirley,
never heard of that one?

40:05.045 --> 40:06.523
It was the house that Shah Jahan

40:06.525 --> 40:08.463
had to build for his second wife

40:08.465 --> 40:11.543
when she got a gander at the
tomb he built for number one.

40:11.545 --> 40:15.293
As Shirley put it, and rightly
so if you want my opinion,

40:15.295 --> 40:17.203
that woman's living better than me,

40:17.205 --> 40:18.663
and she's dead.

40:18.665 --> 40:21.303
The place must have been spectacular.

40:21.305 --> 40:22.973
Oh my yes.

40:22.975 --> 40:26.113
Not only was it twice
as big as the Taj Mahal,

40:26.115 --> 40:30.463
but the reflecting pool was indoors.

40:30.465 --> 40:32.733
Say what you will about Shirley,

40:32.735 --> 40:35.123
she definitely knew what she wanted.

40:35.125 --> 40:37.183
Which invention impressed you the most?

40:37.185 --> 40:38.073
Where to start?

40:38.075 --> 40:40.613
There are so many you couldn't count.

40:40.615 --> 40:43.245
The safety pin was a real doozy.

40:44.155 --> 40:47.203
Very simple but a real money maker,

40:47.205 --> 40:49.273
and baseball cleats were another.

40:49.275 --> 40:50.633
Without the cleats,

40:50.635 --> 40:52.573
nobody would have ever
gotten to first base.

40:52.575 --> 40:54.673
Half way there, they'd fall down.

40:54.675 --> 40:56.543
It's a very slippery game baseball.

40:56.545 --> 40:59.275
Without the cleats, it
would have been ice skating.

41:00.355 --> 41:03.463
The escalator is a snappy idea.

41:03.465 --> 41:04.993
And the juicer is a pip.

41:04.995 --> 41:06.713
Nothing I enjoy more in the morning

41:06.715 --> 41:10.273
than a nice fresh glass of orange juice.

41:10.275 --> 41:11.203
Do you like orange juice?

41:11.205 --> 41:12.233
Sure.

41:12.235 --> 41:14.143
Everybody does.

41:14.145 --> 41:17.853
But do you ever go to
a park and see a statue

41:17.855 --> 41:20.633
of the smart guy who made it all possible?

41:20.635 --> 41:24.180
And what about the fellow
who invented popcorn?

41:24.182 --> 41:27.923
I never thought of
popcorn as an invention.

41:27.925 --> 41:30.593
It doesn't exactly grow on
trees but technically speaking

41:30.595 --> 41:33.373
you're right, popcorn's
always been around.

41:33.375 --> 41:35.793
But it wasn't always food.

41:35.795 --> 41:37.283
It was packing material.

41:37.285 --> 41:39.893
In fact, it was a guy with a
warehouse full of this stuff

41:39.895 --> 41:41.233
who made it all possible.

41:41.235 --> 41:44.273
One night he sat up in bed and shouted,

41:44.275 --> 41:46.203
butter and salt.

41:46.205 --> 41:50.123
Scared his wife half to
death, but he made millions.

41:50.125 --> 41:51.873
And that's where you got the saying,

41:51.875 --> 41:55.463
one man's packing material
is another man's snack.

41:55.465 --> 41:59.193
I think you may need
this more than I do,

41:59.195 --> 42:02.423
oh yeah never mind, I don't
want you to have that.

42:02.425 --> 42:05.793
Now now listen, what made
the old days bearable

42:05.795 --> 42:06.895
were the bosses.

42:07.775 --> 42:09.483
But weren't they all corrupt,

42:09.485 --> 42:13.173
I mean surely you don't long
for the return of Tammany Hall.

42:13.175 --> 42:16.603
These days the people have
to bribe the politicians

42:16.605 --> 42:18.233
to get anything done.

42:18.235 --> 42:22.243
In the old days the politicians
would bribe the people.

42:22.245 --> 42:25.623
Two bucks per vote, if you
voted for the right party.

42:25.625 --> 42:29.593
On election day a go
getter could really score.

42:29.595 --> 42:34.143
He could get himself 10 bucks, 10 bucks.

42:34.145 --> 42:37.843
Now that'd feed family
of four, for a week.

42:37.845 --> 42:39.503
Surely you don't think life was better

42:39.505 --> 42:42.042
back in those dark ages do you?

42:42.044 --> 42:45.233
It was if you were a parent.

42:45.235 --> 42:47.493
You're too young to
remember I suppose but,

42:47.495 --> 42:50.303
there was a time when
youngsters were grateful

42:50.305 --> 42:52.183
to find an apple in
their Christmas stocking.

42:52.185 --> 42:53.833
I should say so.

42:53.835 --> 42:55.563
They were grateful for the stocking.

42:55.565 --> 42:56.843
It's the thought that counted.

42:56.845 --> 42:59.463
When do you think things
started falling apart?

42:59.465 --> 43:02.003
When parents started giving
their kids spending money.

43:02.005 --> 43:03.313
And the car keys.

43:03.315 --> 43:04.353
Cable.

43:04.355 --> 43:05.683
Store bought clothes.

43:05.685 --> 43:08.249
Their own phones, their own beds.

43:08.251 --> 43:09.534
Their own opinions.

43:09.536 --> 43:12.103
Their own bathrooms, and
one thing led to another.

43:12.105 --> 43:13.603
Their own bathrooms.

43:13.605 --> 43:14.983
Yeah that's right mister.

43:14.985 --> 43:17.493
They began feeling entitled
to the modern luxuries of life

43:17.495 --> 43:19.173
and they hadn't done anything to earn it.

43:19.175 --> 43:22.183
They didn't milk the cows
or till the South 40.

43:22.185 --> 43:23.423
They didn't even take out the trash

43:23.425 --> 43:24.743
or bring in the newspaper.

43:24.745 --> 43:26.743
Or say thank you for all that matter.

43:26.745 --> 43:29.343
And still their parents
went on treating them

43:29.345 --> 43:30.963
like little Dalai Lamas.

43:30.965 --> 43:31.993
But at least teenagers

43:31.995 --> 43:34.603
now have a sense of their own worth.

43:34.605 --> 43:37.033
An overinflated sense you mean.

43:37.035 --> 43:39.863
Why do you think people
persist in having children?

43:39.865 --> 43:42.025
The perpetuation of the human race.

43:43.009 --> 43:43.842
For their pelts.

43:45.332 --> 43:46.923
For their pelts.

43:46.925 --> 43:50.293
What do you consider the
biggest problem with air travel?

43:50.295 --> 43:51.553
Leg room.

43:51.555 --> 43:54.473
People keep getting taller and
seats keep getting smaller.

43:54.475 --> 43:56.313
Do you see a solution?

43:56.315 --> 43:57.683
Oh sure, but it will first mean

43:57.685 --> 43:59.773
soaking passengers in olive oil.

43:59.775 --> 44:02.025
What's the best thing
about being an angel?

44:03.885 --> 44:06.353
We get to sneak in
all the movies for free.

44:06.355 --> 44:07.305
What's the worst?

44:08.385 --> 44:09.255
The movies.

44:10.205 --> 44:11.753
Who would have known that the movies

44:11.755 --> 44:13.123
would catch on the way they did?

44:13.125 --> 44:15.083
I mean I just thought it was a novelty,

44:15.085 --> 44:16.723
a fad, like the yo-yo.

44:16.725 --> 44:19.563
I thought when Mary
Pickford hung up her coals,

44:19.565 --> 44:20.613
it would all blow over.

44:20.615 --> 44:22.813
Seems like just yesterday,
you paid a nickel

44:22.815 --> 44:25.213
and saw eight acts that
would knock your socks off,

44:25.215 --> 44:28.203
not to mention, chorus girls
with meat on their bones.

44:28.205 --> 44:31.243
Now you pay 10 bucks to watch Jim Carry

44:31.245 --> 44:33.163
make faces for two hours.

44:33.165 --> 44:35.243
Why is it, if travel is so much bother,

44:35.245 --> 44:37.513
people still insist on taking trips?

44:37.515 --> 44:39.443
I myself blame it on the movies.

44:39.445 --> 44:41.263
I don't see the connection.

44:41.265 --> 44:42.753
In the movies they don't show you

44:42.755 --> 44:45.423
any of the bad or boring parts of travel.

44:45.425 --> 44:47.423
People in the movies never spend six hours

44:47.425 --> 44:48.573
going through customs

44:48.575 --> 44:50.643
and they never strip search
because they look a tiny bit

44:50.645 --> 44:52.703
like a fugitive terrorist.

44:52.705 --> 44:55.883
In the movies people never
get sick from the water.

44:55.885 --> 44:57.803
Their hotel rooms are
always ready and waiting

44:57.805 --> 44:59.853
and the telephone always works.

44:59.855 --> 45:02.993
In the movies people spend all
their time falling in love,

45:02.995 --> 45:06.083
not trying to track
down their lost luggage.

45:06.085 --> 45:07.873
The clinture though is that in the movies,

45:07.875 --> 45:09.993
people can spend their
entire holidays in Rome,

45:09.995 --> 45:12.903
eating pasta and drinking
wine and never gain an ounce.

45:12.905 --> 45:14.403
And when you get right down to it,

45:14.405 --> 45:17.183
the worst thing that ever
happened to tourists in the movies

45:17.185 --> 45:20.093
was that they got seduced
by Rossano Brazzi.

45:20.095 --> 45:22.033
Now that you mention it,

45:22.035 --> 45:24.433
he did pop up in an awful
lot of those movies.

45:24.435 --> 45:26.273
The man did more for the travel industry

45:26.275 --> 45:28.893
than honey roasted peanuts
and drownmin combined.

45:28.895 --> 45:30.503
Do you have a favorite show?

45:30.505 --> 45:32.093
Wouldn't that be like asking a mother

45:32.095 --> 45:34.433
if she has a favorite child?

45:34.435 --> 45:37.983
Each in its own way is special.

45:37.985 --> 45:40.723
But just between us, I must confess,

45:40.725 --> 45:44.373
I have a special soft spot for quiz shows.

45:44.375 --> 45:46.523
Really, why do you think that is?

45:46.525 --> 45:49.913
I believe it must be because
they're so educational.

45:49.915 --> 45:53.133
Some people actually believe
TV destroys brain cells.

45:53.135 --> 45:55.363
I wouldn't want to sound judgmental,

45:55.365 --> 45:57.813
but those people don't
have two brain cells

45:57.815 --> 46:00.033
to rub together if you ask me.

46:00.035 --> 46:01.983
I must say for someone in the love game,

46:01.985 --> 46:04.305
you don't seem to have your heart in it.

46:05.545 --> 46:07.243
Don't you believe in your own product?

46:07.245 --> 46:10.673
Of course I do, but
you people are hopeless.

46:10.675 --> 46:13.703
Lust has long replaced love
as the governing emotion

46:13.705 --> 46:17.933
and romance has given way to pornography.

46:17.935 --> 46:20.193
Why wouldn't I be a pessimist?

46:20.195 --> 46:24.813
I truly believed the world
sought what I had to offer.

46:24.815 --> 46:26.803
Now the scales fell from my eyes

46:26.805 --> 46:30.503
and I see the tunnel at
the end of the light.

46:30.505 --> 46:32.353
Is there nothing that can be done?

46:32.355 --> 46:36.903
Well I can't speak for
everyone but I managed to get by

46:36.905 --> 46:38.703
renting Casa Blanca.

46:38.705 --> 46:41.153
And Now Voyager every few months

46:41.155 --> 46:43.813
and a little white wine never hurts.

46:43.815 --> 46:46.073
Tell me, who thought up applause.

46:46.075 --> 46:48.483
No one thought it up,
it was an accident really.

46:48.485 --> 46:51.373
You see, in the beginning,
when people liked a performer,

46:51.375 --> 46:52.783
they stayed quiet.

46:52.785 --> 46:55.753
The more they liked it,
the quieter they were.

46:55.755 --> 47:00.755
Then one night, some musician
was making music with rocks

47:01.485 --> 47:04.663
and mosquitoes the were
driving everyone nuts.

47:04.665 --> 47:07.653
People were slapping themselves so hard,

47:07.655 --> 47:10.213
made such a racquet you
couldn't hear the music.

47:10.215 --> 47:12.613
But the musician kept on playing.

47:12.615 --> 47:16.993
So in one fell swoop
you got rock and roll,

47:16.995 --> 47:18.783
applause and encores.

47:18.785 --> 47:20.793
Is there any one
person whose contribution

47:20.795 --> 47:22.983
seems to be greater than all the rest?

47:22.985 --> 47:24.413
Absolutely.

47:24.415 --> 47:26.263
Henry Ford, the Wright Brothers.

47:26.265 --> 47:27.803
H.G. Wells.

47:27.805 --> 47:31.353
Why H.G. Wells? What
did he do for travel.

47:31.355 --> 47:33.833
He dreamed up the time machine.

47:33.835 --> 47:35.553
A person sat at home in a chair

47:35.555 --> 47:38.023
and time did all the traveling.

47:38.025 --> 47:39.203
You wanted to go somewhere

47:39.205 --> 47:41.105
you flipped a dial and it came to you.

47:43.215 --> 47:45.023
The next best was Gutenberg.

47:45.025 --> 47:47.905
The Gutenberg who
invented the printing press.

47:47.907 --> 47:50.401
There was another Gutenberg?

47:50.403 --> 47:52.923
But what's the printing
press got to do with travel.

47:52.925 --> 47:54.993
After Gutenberg, if
people suddenly decided

47:54.995 --> 47:56.323
they wanted to go visit Timbuktu

47:56.325 --> 47:58.665
they could read about it first.

47:58.667 --> 48:00.883
After 20 pages they got bored,
they could put the book down

48:00.885 --> 48:02.353
and they were home.

48:02.355 --> 48:04.603
No packing, no catching
the next plane out,

48:04.605 --> 48:07.233
no worrying about the city flyers.

48:07.235 --> 48:09.933
Some people say travel is broadening.

48:09.935 --> 48:11.473
Sure and some people like cannibals,

48:11.475 --> 48:13.353
there's no accounting for taste.

48:13.355 --> 48:14.913
As someone once pointed out,

48:14.915 --> 48:16.403
if travel were all that broadening,

48:16.405 --> 48:17.563
stewardesses and buzz

48:17.565 --> 48:19.703
wouldn't be the smartest people on earth.

48:19.705 --> 48:22.105
I probably shouldn't
tell tales out of school,

48:23.075 --> 48:28.075
but the possibility of pulling
the plug on the human race

48:28.465 --> 48:30.663
has been discussed more than once.

48:30.665 --> 48:31.633
No.

48:31.635 --> 48:33.565
Yes, yes.

48:34.545 --> 48:36.643
The ones that were in favor of it

48:36.645 --> 48:38.893
thought that it would be
more merciful in the long run

48:38.895 --> 48:41.253
because of the damage
they're doing to the planet

48:41.255 --> 48:42.555
and the other inhabitants.

48:43.445 --> 48:46.093
But it never came up to a final vote

48:46.095 --> 48:48.723
because the dogs went to bat for you.

48:48.725 --> 48:52.653
I don't know why, heaven
knows they have a soft spot

48:52.655 --> 48:54.333
in their hearts for people.

48:54.335 --> 48:58.373
It may sound like so
much bow wow to you sir,

48:58.375 --> 49:01.603
but it was only their eloquence
that saved your bacon.

49:01.605 --> 49:02.853
Gee.

49:02.855 --> 49:04.335
Gee indeed.

49:05.255 --> 49:08.483
The only thing they haven't
been able to figure out is,

49:08.485 --> 49:11.103
why, if they're your best friends,

49:11.105 --> 49:13.653
the way you always claim they are,

49:13.655 --> 49:16.883
why so many of you insist
on paling around with cats.

49:16.885 --> 49:19.323
Don't look at me, I'm allergic.

49:19.325 --> 49:20.156
Ms. Mary.

49:20.158 --> 49:20.991
Yes.

49:21.945 --> 49:22.823
You wouldn't happen to know

49:22.825 --> 49:25.175
a little Schnauzer named
Whiskers would you?

49:26.465 --> 49:28.333
Yes I do.

49:28.335 --> 49:31.833
It took me weeks to heaven
break that little dickens,

49:31.835 --> 49:34.305
but he was worth it, he's a love.

49:36.065 --> 49:38.543
Would you tell him that I said hello.

49:38.545 --> 49:40.323
My pleasure.

49:40.325 --> 49:41.203
Thank you.

49:41.205 --> 49:42.225
You're welcome.

49:43.905 --> 49:46.485
Remember when the reporter
was talking about his dog.

49:47.525 --> 49:48.413
Yeah.

49:48.415 --> 49:50.153
That could have been me.

49:50.155 --> 49:52.005
You had a Schnauzer named Whiskers.

49:53.665 --> 49:54.773
Not exactly.

49:54.775 --> 49:56.325
You had a dog named Whiskers?

49:57.245 --> 49:58.903
Not exactly.

49:58.905 --> 50:00.225
Did you even have a dog?

50:03.145 --> 50:03.978
Not exactly.

50:05.595 --> 50:07.233
My dad didn't like dogs.

50:07.235 --> 50:09.483
I had an invisible friend named Lenad.

50:09.485 --> 50:10.473
But I couldn't have loved him any more

50:10.475 --> 50:12.025
if he had four feet and a tail.

50:13.735 --> 50:15.639
What happened to him.

50:15.641 --> 50:17.213
One day he chased a ball into the street

50:17.215 --> 50:18.415
and he got hit by a car.

50:19.500 --> 50:21.723
I still miss him.

50:21.725 --> 50:23.013
He'd be 52 years old today

50:23.015 --> 50:25.133
if he didn't stop to scratch himself.

50:25.135 --> 50:28.723
Who came up with the idea
of eating three meals a day.

50:28.725 --> 50:29.556
The English.

50:29.558 --> 50:32.213
In the 14th century,
there were two princes.

50:32.215 --> 50:35.103
Harold the fat and Bertrum the Bulimic.

50:35.105 --> 50:38.823
Harold felt that five meals
a day was just about right.

50:38.825 --> 50:40.003
While his brother Bertrum

50:40.005 --> 50:42.153
argued that one was quite sufficient,

50:42.155 --> 50:44.643
especially if you didn't swallow.

50:44.645 --> 50:47.243
Before a war broke out
between the two factions,

50:47.245 --> 50:49.283
their father, Arnold the Moderate,

50:49.285 --> 50:51.623
worked out a compromise.

50:51.625 --> 50:54.383
It was Arnold who gave meals their names.

50:54.385 --> 50:57.973
Breakfast was so called
because it broke a fast.

50:57.975 --> 51:00.103
And dinner was named
after the bell they rang

51:00.105 --> 51:01.463
when it was time to eat.

51:01.465 --> 51:02.463
And lunch?

51:02.465 --> 51:04.833
Named after the Duke of Lunch.

51:04.835 --> 51:08.263
The man who said, just because
it's too late for breakfast

51:08.265 --> 51:09.603
and too early for dinner,

51:09.605 --> 51:12.083
doesn't mean we've gotta starve.

51:12.085 --> 51:15.073
I suppose people simply
decided that it simply

51:15.075 --> 51:17.213
didn't matter which fork they used.

51:17.215 --> 51:18.503
The tricky part was getting people

51:18.505 --> 51:20.443
to use forks in the first place

51:20.445 --> 51:23.203
for something besides
scratching their back.

51:23.205 --> 51:26.913
But why were the rules
of etiquette so elaborate?

51:26.915 --> 51:31.113
So that people could relax,
knowing exactly how to behave

51:31.115 --> 51:33.743
in every social situation.

51:33.745 --> 51:36.203
Is there nobody these days

51:36.205 --> 51:38.883
that you think even has a spark if genius.

51:38.885 --> 51:40.923
The pickings are awfully slim

51:40.925 --> 51:43.903
but I suppose if I had
to come up with one name,

51:43.905 --> 51:44.975
it would be Oprah.

51:46.135 --> 51:49.363
Oprah Winfrey is a genius.

51:49.365 --> 51:52.203
Let me put it to you
that turning lead into gold

51:52.205 --> 51:54.493
used to be considered a big deal.

51:54.495 --> 51:59.495
This woman managed to turn
drivel into two billion dollars.

51:59.515 --> 52:02.183
I think even Ag would have been impressed.

52:02.185 --> 52:03.443
Who else comes to mind

52:03.445 --> 52:05.903
when you think of the great romantics?

52:05.905 --> 52:09.543
Norman Couperman, makes
right there up at the top.

52:09.545 --> 52:11.143
What did he do?

52:11.145 --> 52:13.333
It's what he didn't do.

52:13.335 --> 52:18.335
During World War II, PFC Couperman
got to see Marlana Ditrig

52:19.095 --> 52:20.785
at the Hollywood canteen.

52:22.065 --> 52:23.535
She kissed him on the cheek

52:24.515 --> 52:26.883
and he never again washed his face.

52:26.885 --> 52:29.843
Now that's what I call romantic.

52:29.845 --> 52:31.543
It's not very hygienic.

52:31.545 --> 52:32.753
Well that's true.

52:32.755 --> 52:36.013
But should I remind you
romance isn't for sissies.

52:36.015 --> 52:39.703
Look at Van Gogh, for
love he gave up an ear.

52:39.705 --> 52:41.243
And Edward you may recall,

52:41.245 --> 52:43.043
even gave up the throne of England.

52:43.045 --> 52:45.443
If it doesn't come at enormous sacrifice,

52:45.445 --> 52:47.503
it's not romance dear boy,

52:47.505 --> 52:49.123
it's just dating.

52:49.125 --> 52:51.063
Obviously you've seen them all,

52:51.065 --> 52:52.993
but who would you say is
the greatest entertainer

52:52.995 --> 52:54.095
who ever lived.

52:55.125 --> 52:57.653
It's hard to put a finger on one person.

52:57.655 --> 53:00.933
I mean did Will Rogers
play the musical saw?

53:00.935 --> 53:02.523
Did Fanny Brace Juggle?

53:02.525 --> 53:05.253
If Gallagan Sheen tap danced, I missed it.

53:05.255 --> 53:07.473
Did Gipsy Rose Lee do impressions?

53:07.475 --> 53:10.533
Who cares, now if you
wanted the loudest voice,

53:10.535 --> 53:13.903
that would be Carooser, the
guy had lungs like watermelons.

53:13.905 --> 53:15.113
The funny thing about Carooser though

53:15.115 --> 53:16.183
he could never whistle.

53:16.185 --> 53:17.016
When he tried to whistle

53:17.018 --> 53:19.603
it'd sound like he had
crackers in his mouth.

53:19.605 --> 53:22.453
That's why the guy never owned
a dog, you can look it up.

53:22.455 --> 53:23.913
Now if it's whistling you wanted,

53:23.915 --> 53:27.143
then you had the choice
between Widama's Birds

53:27.145 --> 53:28.323
and Al Johnson.

53:28.325 --> 53:29.733
Even that was a toss up.

53:29.735 --> 53:31.395
I mean Johnson had more range.

53:32.245 --> 53:33.645
But the birds were Husbrock.

53:34.705 --> 53:37.043
In your opinion who was
the greatest of them all,

53:37.045 --> 53:42.045
was it Garbo, Tracy, Gabel or Herper.

53:42.621 --> 53:44.383
In my opinion, the best of the bunch,

53:44.385 --> 53:48.293
the one who impressed me the
most was Esther Williams.

53:48.295 --> 53:49.593
Esther Williams?

53:49.595 --> 53:52.013
Who else, that broad was a big star,

53:52.015 --> 53:53.543
never got out of the pool.

53:53.545 --> 53:54.663
You think that was easy?

53:54.665 --> 53:57.573
You try doing a performance
in eight feet of water.

53:57.575 --> 53:59.463
The Chlorine alone could kill you.

53:59.465 --> 54:03.263
And that made her greater
than say Sir Lawrence Livia.

54:03.265 --> 54:05.083
There was no comparison.

54:05.085 --> 54:07.153
He acted in the west end you noticed.

54:07.155 --> 54:08.485
But never in the deep end.

54:09.405 --> 54:11.875
How was it decided
that you of all angels

54:12.725 --> 54:16.293
would have been assigned to sports.

54:16.295 --> 54:18.273
Well I don't know for certain.

54:18.275 --> 54:19.923
But I would venture
that they looked around

54:19.925 --> 54:20.756
for something else

54:20.758 --> 54:23.963
that had lots of rules governing conduct.

54:23.965 --> 54:27.003
Rules after all, are my meat.

54:27.005 --> 54:29.683
Do you oversee all areas of sports

54:29.685 --> 54:32.793
including basketball and football?

54:32.795 --> 54:36.443
Oh, so you can still
distinguish between the two.

54:36.445 --> 54:39.173
You really must be paying close attention.

54:39.175 --> 54:40.943
But to answer your question though,

54:40.945 --> 54:43.393
basically all physical activity

54:43.395 --> 54:46.083
asides from sex and channel surfing

54:46.085 --> 54:48.753
falls within my domain.

54:48.755 --> 54:52.003
I'm not questioning your qualifications,

54:52.005 --> 54:55.563
well actually I guess I am
questioning your qualifications.

54:55.565 --> 54:57.673
You just don't strike me as a jock.

54:57.675 --> 54:59.703
I suppose that's why I got the job,

54:59.705 --> 55:02.733
they were looking for
a civilizing influence.

55:02.735 --> 55:06.583
What has been your
greatest single challenge?

55:06.585 --> 55:08.333
Actually there are two.

55:08.335 --> 55:10.742
The first was artichokes.

55:10.744 --> 55:14.863
Took me over a thousand years
to figure out how to eat em.

55:14.865 --> 55:17.363
But the real toughy was alcohol.

55:17.365 --> 55:20.033
The stuff tasted awful, it smelled worse

55:20.035 --> 55:23.503
and it played tidly winks
with the old kidneys.

55:23.505 --> 55:26.353
All that being the
case, why'd you bother?

55:26.355 --> 55:27.783
Just because it made us laugh

55:27.785 --> 55:29.163
when you folks would get drunk

55:29.165 --> 55:31.893
and start arguing politics and religion.

55:31.895 --> 55:34.593
Even if I grant that
running for political office

55:34.595 --> 55:36.273
can be a pricey enterprise,

55:36.275 --> 55:39.265
surely that's money donated
with no strings attached.

55:40.515 --> 55:44.373
The lobbyist doesn't walk
around with a bag full of money.

55:44.375 --> 55:48.753
They advise where to invest this money

55:48.755 --> 55:53.643
and that senator gets to
vote on getting it done.

55:53.645 --> 55:56.023
What about the ones
who already have money?

55:56.025 --> 55:59.703
Nobody ever seems to have enough money.

55:59.705 --> 56:01.443
You don't see Bill Gates

56:01.445 --> 56:04.063
picking up his pension check do you?

56:04.065 --> 56:06.763
You make it sound so tawdry.

56:06.765 --> 56:11.765
The fact remains that no
matter how poor a guy is

56:12.655 --> 56:14.153
when he first gets elected,

56:14.155 --> 56:18.733
by the time he retires, he's wealthy

56:18.735 --> 56:23.135
and all because he knows
how to vote on the job.

56:24.095 --> 56:26.793
Sounds to me like the real
problem is the lobbyists.

56:26.795 --> 56:30.903
He's just providing a public service.

56:30.905 --> 56:33.123
The question is why should anyone

56:33.125 --> 56:36.253
give a contribution to a candidate

56:36.255 --> 56:39.443
unless he expects to get
it back a thousand fold.

56:39.445 --> 56:40.803
And yet some people do.

56:40.805 --> 56:43.103
I've contributed to a
few political campaigns.

56:43.105 --> 56:45.363
I mean, I wasn't expecting any favors,

56:45.365 --> 56:46.493
I just felt the candidate

56:46.495 --> 56:49.223
would have best represented my concerns.

56:49.225 --> 56:51.893
There's a word for people like you.

56:51.895 --> 56:53.125
Responsible citizen.

56:55.125 --> 56:56.483
Sucker.

56:56.485 --> 57:00.093
Would you agree that
nothing beats organized sports

57:00.095 --> 57:03.323
for turning young boys into real men.

57:03.325 --> 57:06.003
I'm just a little old lady angel,

57:06.005 --> 57:08.523
so what do I know of such matters.

57:08.525 --> 57:12.163
Still, it always struck
me as a whee bit odd

57:12.165 --> 57:13.603
that organized athletics

57:13.605 --> 57:17.105
called for 30 to 40 robust
young men to shower together,

57:18.025 --> 57:19.853
when everyone knows that's the main reason

57:19.855 --> 57:22.793
10% of them join the
team in the first place.

57:22.795 --> 57:24.793
Looking back over your career,

57:24.795 --> 57:27.243
who are some of the other
artists that stand out.

57:27.245 --> 57:31.593
Picasso was almost as
cute as he thought he was.

57:31.595 --> 57:34.223
Dali, crazy as a poodle.

57:34.225 --> 57:36.733
Remprant never took a bath.

57:36.735 --> 57:39.273
Wooslier was a mama's boy.

57:39.275 --> 57:42.273
And the biggest pain in the
neck was that Botticelli.

57:42.275 --> 57:43.106
Why was that?

57:43.108 --> 57:45.503
He's the one who insisted
on painting us angels

57:45.505 --> 57:47.813
in those sappy robes and the big halos.

57:47.815 --> 57:51.253
The flowing ribbons and all the
rest of that silly faldural.

57:51.255 --> 57:53.433
But you're not dressed that way now.

57:53.435 --> 57:55.913
That's because we're not working.

57:55.915 --> 57:59.353
When we're on the job, we
have to be in full regalia,

57:59.355 --> 58:01.373
it's how people expect to see us,

58:01.375 --> 58:04.143
all because of his goofy paintings.

58:04.145 --> 58:06.213
The man wasn't an artist,

58:06.215 --> 58:08.383
he was a costume designer
with a paint brush.

58:08.385 --> 58:11.423
If we showed up not looking
the way he painted us,

58:11.425 --> 58:12.943
people assumed we were just ghosts

58:12.945 --> 58:15.343
or the end result of too many dry martinis

58:15.345 --> 58:18.623
but if we appeared looking
like something whipped up

58:18.625 --> 58:20.443
by a French pastry chef,

58:20.445 --> 58:22.053
people took us seriously.

58:22.055 --> 58:24.743
Did Botticelli become
an angel when he died?

58:24.745 --> 58:25.823
Why do you ask?

58:25.825 --> 58:27.783
I just thought it would be very ironic

58:27.785 --> 58:30.833
if he himself wound up having
to spend all of eternity

58:30.835 --> 58:32.685
looking like a piece of wedding cake.

58:33.655 --> 58:37.323
Yes, I suppose that
would have been ironic but,

58:37.325 --> 58:40.163
ol' Botticelli didn't
exactly get his wings,

58:40.165 --> 58:43.913
what he got were his just desserts.

58:43.915 --> 58:45.223
What happened to him?

58:45.225 --> 58:47.353
He's busting tables at the cafe limbo.

58:47.355 --> 58:49.943
I bet he wishes he stuck to landscapes.

58:49.945 --> 58:51.733
Too late now.

58:51.735 --> 58:54.063
What ol' Botticelli didn't get I'm afraid,

58:54.065 --> 58:57.955
is that angels don't
get irony, we get even.

58:59.825 --> 59:03.053
I was wondering whatever
happened to Christopher,

59:03.055 --> 59:06.323
the one who used to be the
patron saint of travelers?

59:06.325 --> 59:08.613
Ever since the demotion,
he was plenty bitter.

59:08.615 --> 59:09.883
Only time he'd even leave the house

59:09.885 --> 59:11.943
was in the middle of the night
when he'd run out to airports

59:11.945 --> 59:13.373
and mix up people's luggage.

59:13.375 --> 59:15.083
So he is the one.

59:15.085 --> 59:16.713
Yes but he's okay now.

59:16.715 --> 59:18.103
Ever since he and the Mrs, got cable,

59:18.105 --> 59:20.063
he seems satisfied to stay at home

59:20.065 --> 59:22.133
and watch old travel logs.

59:22.135 --> 59:26.583
Well in the old days after
all, things were pretty brutal.

59:26.585 --> 59:29.413
With the Mayans, the loosing
athletes were sacrificed

59:29.415 --> 59:33.573
to appease the, you should
excuse the expression, gods.

59:33.575 --> 59:35.783
These days, if worse comes to worse,

59:35.785 --> 59:37.235
they get traded to Milwaukee.

59:38.675 --> 59:41.453
There are those who feel
that winning is everything,

59:41.455 --> 59:42.863
are you one of those people?

59:42.865 --> 59:46.433
Hardly, I am firmly of the
opinion that it doesn't matter

59:46.435 --> 59:49.665
if you win or loose, it's
how you play the game,

59:50.539 --> 59:52.995
unless of course you're an ancient Mayan.

59:54.435 --> 59:56.383
Who are some of the
great chefs you've known?

59:56.385 --> 59:59.483
At the top of the list
Charles of the Ritz,

59:59.485 --> 01:00:02.383
famous for his toasted cheese sandwich.

01:00:02.385 --> 01:00:03.393
He invented it?

01:00:03.395 --> 01:00:05.493
No, but he did perfect it.

01:00:05.495 --> 01:00:07.813
He was the guy who first burnt the cheese

01:00:07.815 --> 01:00:09.403
around the edge a little.

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:11.233
The man was genius.

01:00:11.235 --> 01:00:12.403
There are people who claim

01:00:12.405 --> 01:00:14.403
it is immoral for us to eat meat,

01:00:14.405 --> 01:00:15.443
do you agree?

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:18.473
That's really not my area.

01:00:18.475 --> 01:00:21.583
The way I look at it, if
it tastes good, eat it.

01:00:21.585 --> 01:00:24.043
You're saying morality
doesn't enter into it?

01:00:24.045 --> 01:00:25.743
Keep in mind that,

01:00:25.745 --> 01:00:27.923
what appears to be a question of morality

01:00:27.925 --> 01:00:30.483
is very often only a matter of geography.

01:00:30.485 --> 01:00:33.173
Cows are held to be sacred in some places,

01:00:33.175 --> 01:00:35.843
in some dogs are considered snacks.

01:00:35.845 --> 01:00:38.153
Or take bugs, in one
country they're pests,

01:00:38.155 --> 01:00:40.053
in another they're protein.

01:00:40.055 --> 01:00:41.793
When you start talking morality,

01:00:41.795 --> 01:00:45.893
you get into a big gray
area, for instance,

01:00:45.895 --> 01:00:49.413
there are definitely those,
and I count myself among them,

01:00:49.415 --> 01:00:53.013
who saw it as a giant step,
up the evolutionary ladder,

01:00:53.015 --> 01:00:55.173
when people started eating mutton

01:00:55.175 --> 01:00:56.525
and gave up dating it.

01:00:58.085 --> 01:00:59.863
I don't know if this comes under

01:00:59.865 --> 01:01:01.133
the category of air travel,

01:01:01.135 --> 01:01:03.173
but I am curious about one thing?

01:01:03.175 --> 01:01:05.173
Don't ask, I still don't understand

01:01:05.175 --> 01:01:07.483
how frequent flyer miles work.

01:01:07.485 --> 01:01:11.833
No, it's those people who
you read about all the time,

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:13.443
that get hit by trains,

01:01:13.445 --> 01:01:16.573
they can't all be committing suicide.

01:01:16.575 --> 01:01:18.315
I have a newsflash for you.

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:21.953
None of them is committing suicide.

01:01:21.955 --> 01:01:24.373
Then how do they get themselves killed,

01:01:24.375 --> 01:01:26.943
I mean a train doesn't sneak up on you,

01:01:26.945 --> 01:01:29.893
a train for god's sakes is
bigger than a herd of elephants,

01:01:29.895 --> 01:01:31.843
louder than a teenager's boom box

01:01:31.845 --> 01:01:34.793
and they can't jump off the
tracks and chase you down,

01:01:34.795 --> 01:01:38.133
so how does it happen that
trains kill more people

01:01:38.135 --> 01:01:40.173
than disgruntled postal employees

01:01:40.175 --> 01:01:43.223
and botulism put together.

01:01:43.225 --> 01:01:47.083
Does the number 49 have
any significance for you?

01:01:47.085 --> 01:01:49.113
Bill O'Reilly's hat size?

01:01:49.115 --> 01:01:51.343
Close, but no cigar. No.

01:01:51.345 --> 01:01:53.533
That's the average IQ of people

01:01:53.535 --> 01:01:55.923
who get run over by choo choos.

01:01:55.925 --> 01:01:59.315
In the wild kingdom it's
referred to as thinning the herd.

01:02:00.505 --> 01:02:02.093
Do you have a favorite sport?

01:02:02.095 --> 01:02:04.943
Professional wrestling,
nobody gets hurt.

01:02:04.945 --> 01:02:06.723
Which sport was the worst?

01:02:06.725 --> 01:02:08.693
Christians Versus The Lions.

01:02:08.695 --> 01:02:11.313
Even the bookies didn't
care much for that one.

01:02:11.315 --> 01:02:13.363
What's the strangest
sport you've ever seen?

01:02:13.365 --> 01:02:16.253
Without a doubt, that would
have to be early Water Polo.

01:02:16.255 --> 01:02:17.413
Really, why is that?

01:02:17.415 --> 01:02:18.883
It took them a while to figure out

01:02:18.885 --> 01:02:20.765
it just wouldn't work with horses.

01:02:21.625 --> 01:02:23.303
Finally, Ms. Minerva,

01:02:23.305 --> 01:02:25.013
if you weren't in charge of sports,

01:02:25.015 --> 01:02:26.615
what job would you like to have.

01:02:27.805 --> 01:02:28.943
Well lately,

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:31.213
I've been thinking of
giving real estate a whirl.

01:02:31.215 --> 01:02:32.803
What would you do in real estate?

01:02:32.805 --> 01:02:35.115
First I'd send Donald
Trump to Milwaukee.

01:02:36.555 --> 01:02:38.183
Do you have hope for the future?

01:02:38.185 --> 01:02:40.353
Of course I do, why wouldn't I?

01:02:40.355 --> 01:02:41.513
Sometimes I worry,

01:02:41.515 --> 01:02:43.993
that technology is moving too fast for us

01:02:43.995 --> 01:02:47.335
and that, I worry that
it will do away with us.

01:02:48.815 --> 01:02:51.993
No matter how big the
machinery or how intelligent

01:02:51.995 --> 01:02:55.773
or how powerful, that will never happen.

01:02:55.775 --> 01:02:59.443
At least not so long as
we remember one thing.

01:02:59.445 --> 01:03:02.793
And that is that we were
created in god's image

01:03:02.795 --> 01:03:05.103
and that there's a spark of immortality

01:03:05.105 --> 01:03:06.463
in each and every one of us.

01:03:06.465 --> 01:03:10.663
No, the one thing we mustn't ever forget

01:03:10.665 --> 01:03:13.843
is to always include an off switch.

01:03:13.845 --> 01:03:16.983
When the next pair of
angels stood before him,

01:03:16.985 --> 01:03:20.263
he looked around, and he realized,

01:03:20.265 --> 01:03:21.895
they were the last angels left.

01:03:22.853 --> 01:03:25.563
He tried to figure out
what their roles were but,

01:03:25.565 --> 01:03:27.093
what was left?

01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:29.293
The angels of medical mal-practice?

01:03:29.295 --> 01:03:31.483
The angels of insurance injustice.

01:03:31.485 --> 01:03:34.133
The angels of small household appliances.

01:03:34.135 --> 01:03:35.543
In the end he was to learn,

01:03:35.545 --> 01:03:37.893
that not only do cocker
spaniels and chihuahuas

01:03:37.895 --> 01:03:40.443
have higher standing in
heaven than we humans,

01:03:40.445 --> 01:03:42.745
but so do toaster ovens
and electric blankets.

01:03:43.835 --> 01:03:45.833
How have things changed over the years.

01:03:45.835 --> 01:03:47.543
Well we've certainly had to adapt.

01:03:47.545 --> 01:03:50.103
To go along with the flow as it were.

01:03:50.105 --> 01:03:52.223
Along the way we found the need to expand

01:03:52.225 --> 01:03:56.783
to include philosophy,
mythology, dietary law.

01:03:56.785 --> 01:04:01.106
And don't forget military
strategy and medieval torches.

01:04:01.108 --> 01:04:04.086
It's certainly been a
broadening experience.

01:04:04.088 --> 01:04:06.513
Yeah, I'm sure you could have guessed

01:04:06.515 --> 01:04:07.493
but it was getting late

01:04:07.495 --> 01:04:09.243
and he had quite an evening.

01:04:09.245 --> 01:04:11.283
That's why he was rather taken aback

01:04:11.285 --> 01:04:15.753
when Julie and John told him
that their arena was religion.

01:04:15.755 --> 01:04:18.073
Yeah yeah yeah, sure
you would have guessed.

01:04:18.075 --> 01:04:19.483
Right, have it your way.

01:04:19.485 --> 01:04:20.723
I'm sure you also would
have guessed that Mary

01:04:20.725 --> 01:04:21.665
was the dog angel.

01:04:22.505 --> 01:04:25.793
Well in the old days there
were very few religions,

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:26.915
nothing fancy.

01:04:28.145 --> 01:04:31.213
Truth is, if all of the services

01:04:31.215 --> 01:04:33.183
had been conducted in Latin,

01:04:33.185 --> 01:04:34.963
then you would have closed your eyes,

01:04:34.965 --> 01:04:36.053
you'd never know where you were.

01:04:36.055 --> 01:04:38.533
Yeah. But you know how people are.

01:04:38.535 --> 01:04:39.673
Complicated.

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:42.453
Well, let's just say not too bright.

01:04:42.455 --> 01:04:44.703
So before you could say
Moses and the bull rushes,

01:04:44.705 --> 01:04:48.723
there were more religions,
cults, sects and covens

01:04:48.725 --> 01:04:49.973
than you could shake a stick at.

01:04:49.975 --> 01:04:52.133
Tempted as you might be.

01:04:52.135 --> 01:04:54.423
They just sprang up like toad stores.

01:04:54.425 --> 01:04:56.513
It seems like every
time you turned around,

01:04:56.515 --> 01:04:59.633
there was people speaking
in tongues and channeling

01:04:59.635 --> 01:05:03.883
and reading backwards,
twirling around in circles,

01:05:03.885 --> 01:05:05.585
playing with snakes.

01:05:06.465 --> 01:05:08.133
What's religion like in heaven,

01:05:08.135 --> 01:05:11.529
I mean do you go to church,
does god give sermon?

01:05:11.531 --> 01:05:12.883
No.

01:05:12.885 --> 01:05:14.003
Why not?

01:05:14.005 --> 01:05:15.315
We don't need it.

01:05:16.285 --> 01:05:18.043
The main point of religion

01:05:18.045 --> 01:05:20.493
is to remind people that god exists.

01:05:20.495 --> 01:05:22.863
We don't need reminding god exists.

01:05:22.865 --> 01:05:25.443
And if you need reminding,
try turning your stereo on

01:05:25.445 --> 01:05:26.645
sometime after midnight.

01:05:28.055 --> 01:05:31.462
If you could tell people
one thing, what would it be?

01:05:31.464 --> 01:05:32.653
I think people should remember

01:05:32.655 --> 01:05:35.923
that although god answers all prayers.

01:05:35.925 --> 01:05:39.113
Sometimes they have to
accept that the answer is no.

01:05:39.115 --> 01:05:40.833
The only thing wrong with people,

01:05:40.835 --> 01:05:42.725
is they keep on asking questions,

01:05:43.615 --> 01:05:44.803
long after they've been provided

01:05:44.805 --> 01:05:46.743
with all the answers they'll ever need.

01:05:46.745 --> 01:05:48.233
You mean the 10 commandments?

01:05:48.235 --> 01:05:49.066
Yeah.

01:05:49.068 --> 01:05:51.043
The trouble with most
people, if you ask me,

01:05:51.045 --> 01:05:53.683
is that they seem to think
that there are six commandments

01:05:53.685 --> 01:05:55.633
and four suggestions.

01:05:55.635 --> 01:06:00.635
John, Julie, there's one
thing that I have to ask.

01:06:01.255 --> 01:06:02.183
Of course.

01:06:02.185 --> 01:06:04.285
You wouldn't be human if you didn't ask.

01:06:05.145 --> 01:06:07.675
God, what's he like?

01:06:08.695 --> 01:06:09.645
The waitress.

01:06:12.995 --> 01:06:14.395
God looks like a waitress.

01:06:16.525 --> 01:06:18.963
God is the waitress.

01:06:18.965 --> 01:06:20.603
God is the waitress.

01:06:20.605 --> 01:06:23.063
Hey guys, I didn't just
fall off the turnup truck.

01:06:23.065 --> 01:06:25.593
Suit yourself, but that's the truth.

01:06:25.595 --> 01:06:27.809
If you don't believe us, just ask her.

01:06:27.811 --> 01:06:30.213
If she is god, then
I'm a monkey's uncle.

01:06:30.215 --> 01:06:31.863
Close enough.

01:06:31.865 --> 01:06:34.553
Come on honey, let's call it a night.

01:06:34.555 --> 01:06:36.509
Now we get to my favorite part.

01:06:36.511 --> 01:06:38.163
Prelutsky doddled.

01:06:38.165 --> 01:06:40.733
I love that word, couldn't
you see him doddling.

01:06:40.735 --> 01:06:43.043
He's worried that John and
Julie are playing a joke on him

01:06:43.045 --> 01:06:44.593
and he doesn't want to embarrass himself

01:06:44.595 --> 01:06:47.233
by asking an old woman if she's god.

01:06:47.235 --> 01:06:48.513
But how could he resist.

01:06:48.515 --> 01:06:51.893
I mean, as Prelutsky writes,
what could it hurt on a night

01:06:51.895 --> 01:06:53.783
where I've already met
a room full of angels

01:06:53.785 --> 01:06:55.883
to ask an elderly waitress if she's god?

01:06:55.885 --> 01:06:58.123
I'm yet to meet a waiter
in the Jewish

01:06:58.125 --> 01:07:00.033
who wasn't half convinced he was god.

01:07:00.035 --> 01:07:01.585
So what did he have to loose?

01:07:04.605 --> 01:07:05.583
I don't mean to be rude,

01:07:05.585 --> 01:07:09.463
but those two told me that you were god.

01:07:09.465 --> 01:07:11.833
So, what's the question.

01:07:11.835 --> 01:07:14.103
My question is, are you her?

01:07:14.105 --> 01:07:16.633
By her, do you mean me?

01:07:16.635 --> 01:07:19.353
Well I do, if you're her.

01:07:19.355 --> 01:07:21.873
Well if I'm not, then who is?

01:07:21.875 --> 01:07:23.465
So you really are her.

01:07:24.685 --> 01:07:25.845
So help me, me.

01:07:26.758 --> 01:07:27.589
Are you telling me that god

01:07:27.591 --> 01:07:29.633
is waiting tables in crummy bar?

01:07:29.635 --> 01:07:31.003
I've seen worse.

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:35.103
In fact, right at this moment,
I am sweeping up a cafe

01:07:35.105 --> 01:07:37.403
in downtown Beirut,

01:07:37.405 --> 01:07:40.343
makes this place looks like Versailles.

01:07:40.345 --> 01:07:41.893
That's not the point.

01:07:41.895 --> 01:07:44.733
God waiting tables in a
bar, that's outrageous.

01:07:44.735 --> 01:07:46.313
You're right, I suppose,

01:07:46.315 --> 01:07:48.913
and to tell you the truth
a little hard on my feet

01:07:48.915 --> 01:07:51.943
but, I soak em good when I get home.

01:07:51.945 --> 01:07:55.513
But it's honest work,
we got a nice clientele,

01:07:55.515 --> 01:07:57.075
and I get Sunday's off.

01:07:58.725 --> 01:08:01.449
What was that all about.

01:08:01.451 --> 01:08:03.883
Oh, you noticed I left.

01:08:03.885 --> 01:08:04.733
Wasn't I supposed to.

01:08:04.735 --> 01:08:07.093
That was a darn good trick.

01:08:07.095 --> 01:08:08.373
I must be slowing down.

01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:11.443
It used to be, I could be
everywhere all at the same time.

01:08:11.445 --> 01:08:13.101
Where were you just now?

01:08:13.103 --> 01:08:16.553
A giant comet just crashed into Siberia.

01:08:16.555 --> 01:08:20.502
Comets, volcanoes, tidal waves,
I just love all that stuff.

01:08:20.505 --> 01:08:21.893
What are you doing here?

01:08:21.895 --> 01:08:24.752
Mostly staying in
touch with my workforce.

01:08:24.755 --> 01:08:28.183
Like a CEO who is lunching
at the company cafeteria?

01:08:28.185 --> 01:08:29.223
That's the idea,

01:08:29.225 --> 01:08:31.343
it shows that you're just one of the gang.

01:08:31.345 --> 01:08:34.073
It's supposed to boost morale.

01:08:34.075 --> 01:08:35.563
I read all about that in a book

01:08:35.564 --> 01:08:38.843
about modern management techniques,

01:08:38.845 --> 01:08:41.285
oh and I just joined a bowling league,

01:08:42.265 --> 01:08:45.915
I can't tell you how hard it
is for me not to throw strikes.

01:08:46.835 --> 01:08:48.443
Speaking of books.

01:08:48.444 --> 01:08:51.073
How would you suggest I go
about getting published.

01:08:51.075 --> 01:08:53.453
I heard about all those hot shot writers

01:08:53.455 --> 01:08:56.223
that tried and failed,

01:08:56.225 --> 01:08:59.042
and if they couldn't get
published, how can I?

01:08:59.045 --> 01:09:02.053
Frankly, I wouldn't mind
a little positive publicity.

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:04.973
Lately, the only time I
see my name is in print,

01:09:04.975 --> 01:09:09.033
is when Time Periodicals
announces my demise

01:09:09.035 --> 01:09:14.035
or some crazy cult leader
says that he has me on hold.

01:09:15.555 --> 01:09:17.376
What do you think I should do?

01:09:17.377 --> 01:09:20.122
When you write your
book, you give me holler,

01:09:20.125 --> 01:09:21.943
I'll make a few calls.

01:09:21.944 --> 01:09:24.693
You know people in the book business?

01:09:24.694 --> 01:09:26.865
I wrote a bestseller you know.

01:09:27.734 --> 01:09:29.053
I forgot.

01:09:29.055 --> 01:09:30.113
So did they.

01:09:30.115 --> 01:09:33.453
I'm still waiting for
my first royalty check.

01:09:33.455 --> 01:09:36.095
Oh, by the way, your car is ready now.

01:09:37.125 --> 01:09:39.513
I have to admit
that is quite the tale.

01:09:39.515 --> 01:09:41.073
Now you understand why this book

01:09:41.075 --> 01:09:42.053
is so important to me.

01:09:42.055 --> 01:09:43.013
I guess I do.

01:09:43.015 --> 01:09:47.493
Look, I know I'm a joke.

01:09:47.495 --> 01:09:49.303
I've owned paintings,

01:09:49.305 --> 01:09:52.002
and I don't even know how to
say the names of the artists.

01:09:52.005 --> 01:09:55.453
But that doesn't mean I didn't
appreciate their beauty,

01:09:55.455 --> 01:09:59.395
believe me, wallpaper would
have been a whole lot cheaper.

01:10:00.385 --> 01:10:02.243
But I love beautiful things,

01:10:02.245 --> 01:10:05.633
and I want Angels to be a beautiful movie.

01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:06.468
Good luck.

01:10:07.515 --> 01:10:12.053
Sometimes, I know this
is gonna sound nuts,

01:10:12.055 --> 01:10:14.833
but sometimes I feel like my mom

01:10:14.835 --> 01:10:16.765
was standing as close to me as you are

01:10:18.015 --> 01:10:20.752
and she's been gone for nearly 20 years.

01:10:20.754 --> 01:10:23.363
She is the real reason I bought this book.

01:10:23.365 --> 01:10:25.333
So I could dedicate the movie to her.

01:10:25.335 --> 01:10:30.335
She is the real reason that I
know that angels really exist.

01:10:37.485 --> 01:10:38.385
She'd like that.

01:10:53.135 --> 01:10:56.295
Well it was nice meeting you.

01:10:56.297 --> 01:10:57.297
Thank you.

01:10:58.295 --> 01:10:59.126
Peace.

01:10:59.128 --> 01:11:01.275
From your mouth to my ear.

01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:15.165
