00:03.906 --> 00:05.351
Did you sleep with my wife?

00:06.867 --> 00:07.854
How could you.

00:08.643 --> 00:11.622
I don't want some sordid arrangement.
I want you !

00:12.509 --> 00:15.563
I've given some thought to what you
said, postponing the christening.

00:15.571 --> 00:17.938
No please, you were right.

00:18.493 --> 00:19.717
James will return.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.031
Is James here?

00:31.530 --> 00:34.002
I gotta go to work at Carlo's.
Again ?!

00:34.651 --> 00:35.808
Yeah, I promised.

00:35.858 --> 00:38.842
You're too kind Gino,
it's every day now.

00:38.856 --> 00:40.897
The vines, they're not
growing like they should.

00:41.749 --> 00:42.999
Gino, what do you mean?

00:43.026 --> 00:45.002
They should look healthier.
There was a frost this morning.

00:45.034 --> 00:48.231
You are a thoroughly modern
woman, Carolyn but..

00:48.667 --> 00:50.663
Sir Richard's an old
fashioned bloke.

00:50.679 --> 00:53.467
Sir Richard is a pussycat.
I can handle him.

00:53.480 --> 00:54.772
Gimme a kiss.

00:54.898 --> 00:56.124
I said NO !

00:56.150 --> 00:57.647
No one says no to me !

01:04.056 --> 01:07.243
The only thing you need,
to make you unbeatable,

01:07.353 --> 01:08.653
is the right wife.

01:08.778 --> 01:10.418
If I may make a suggestion?

01:10.930 --> 01:12.320
Remove the tie.

01:18.587 --> 01:20.383
I've been speaking
to Patrick Kelly.

01:20.423 --> 01:23.195
He's THE best neuro
surgeon in Sydney.

01:23.212 --> 01:24.844
The risks are too great.

01:24.868 --> 01:26.844
I'm going to have the operation.

01:27.458 --> 01:28.785
A remarkable man.

01:28.973 --> 01:29.965
He was.

01:30.364 --> 01:32.395
And surely, he can be again.

01:33.008 --> 01:36.266
Not without this operation,
Elizabeth, which could kill him.

01:36.727 --> 01:39.070
Roy is out front to take
you to the station.

02:43.084 --> 02:44.648
I'll see you very soon.

02:57.767 --> 02:59.415
You need to take action, George.

02:59.709 --> 03:02.755
This new candidate, could be a
serious threat to the election.

03:02.779 --> 03:04.200
I'm not to concerned about him.

03:04.455 --> 03:05.829
He doesn't have any
more experience..

03:05.837 --> 03:08.373
He has a blond, pretty
wife and all the blokes

03:08.399 --> 03:10.190
turn up at the rally, just
to get a look at her.

03:10.204 --> 03:10.938
It hardly matters.

03:10.978 --> 03:12.993
And the ladies turn up, to
see what she's wearing.

03:13.157 --> 03:16.079
I understand my
situation isn't ideal.

03:16.091 --> 03:18.098
Then make it ideal, man !

03:18.118 --> 03:19.766
I've no doubt, you
could have your pick.

03:19.794 --> 03:22.208
Oh, forgive the
interruption, Sir Richard.

03:22.278 --> 03:24.821
No interruption at all.
I've said my piece.

03:25.255 --> 03:27.106
The bi-election is
not too far away.

03:27.122 --> 03:29.238
It's gonna mean
speeches, campaigning,

03:29.264 --> 03:30.889
shaking hands, kissing babies.

03:31.194 --> 03:32.771
You need someone to
arrange your schedule.

03:32.787 --> 03:33.889
I'll get an assistant.

03:33.905 --> 03:34.920
Or a wife.

03:35.123 --> 03:37.099
It certainly would
be more economical.

03:37.655 --> 03:39.217
Would you like to
stay for lunch?

03:39.346 --> 03:41.525
Or join us at the church, for
my grandson's christening?

03:41.541 --> 03:42.689
Lunch sounds tempting.

03:42.737 --> 03:45.254
Church however, is
bad for my health.

03:45.674 --> 03:48.463
- I'll see you downstairs.
- Mrs. Bligh.

03:51.655 --> 03:54.010
Any word from James?
No.

03:54.767 --> 03:56.696
I left another message at the
Australian, this morning.

03:56.738 --> 03:58.009
It's gone on long enough,

03:58.330 --> 04:00.110
with your campaign about
to begin in Ernest.

04:00.126 --> 04:02.903
Well, I'm sure, he won't do
anything to cast a shadow on that.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.260
Miss Olivia?

04:31.652 --> 04:32.878
Please, go away.

04:33.972 --> 04:36.471
I'm sorry. A parcel
arrived for you.

04:37.941 --> 04:39.089
I don't want it.

04:39.964 --> 04:42.589
No return address. I
thought it might be from..

04:47.550 --> 04:48.487
From James?

04:51.523 --> 04:53.561
Would you like me, to help
you get ready, this morning?

04:54.054 --> 04:55.755
Not right now, thank you.

05:04.017 --> 05:06.466
"I will always remember you"
Lloyd.

05:07.154 --> 05:09.321
Please Rose, just leave me be !

05:09.342 --> 05:10.126
Olivia?

05:12.139 --> 05:13.397
May I come in?

05:15.296 --> 05:16.233
Of course.

05:24.057 --> 05:24.987
Forgive me.

05:27.382 --> 05:29.225
Are you going to
start dressing soon?

05:31.788 --> 05:32.639
I can't.

05:34.078 --> 05:36.205
Olivia, there's no such
word as "can't".

05:36.586 --> 05:38.398
How will I stand there?

05:39.371 --> 05:42.956
In front of everyone,
without James?

05:43.746 --> 05:46.019
Everything's fallen apart.

05:46.207 --> 05:47.589
Oh, sweet Olivia.

05:48.199 --> 05:50.078
This is not your fault.

05:50.297 --> 05:52.913
James is treating you
most thoughtlessly.

05:53.160 --> 05:56.800
Only because I hurt him.

05:57.137 --> 06:00.870
Well, whatever was said,
it will pass.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.785
He'll be here, you'll see.

06:03.355 --> 06:04.011
When?

06:05.801 --> 06:08.454
But today, is our
little Georgie's day.

06:39.588 --> 06:42.829
Sorry caro, I just had
to finish that chapter.

06:45.935 --> 06:47.024
What's happened?

06:48.998 --> 06:50.154
They're all dead.

06:50.873 --> 06:52.574
Every single one of them.

06:54.498 --> 06:57.864
How? We've..
we've been so careful.

06:57.978 --> 06:59.747
It's my fault, I'm a fool.

07:00.158 --> 07:03.845
No darling, there must be
something that we can do.

07:06.306 --> 07:07.667
We planted too late.

07:11.771 --> 07:12.859
We can buy more.

07:13.037 --> 07:14.903
And we can plant
them next spring.

07:15.235 --> 07:15.962
With what, Anna?

07:15.970 --> 07:17.751
We put everything into this.
It's over.

07:21.548 --> 07:23.470
Everything I worked for.

07:25.224 --> 07:26.404
It's alright.

07:39.595 --> 07:42.642
Excuse me, could you tell me?
That woman's husband?

07:42.654 --> 07:43.821
You mean Mrs. Nordmann?

07:44.060 --> 07:44.841
Do you know her?

07:44.935 --> 07:49.251
I'm a friend, from Inverness,
a dismal place, very tiny.

07:49.826 --> 07:51.171
She hasn't left that
seat, since her

07:51.197 --> 07:53.546
husband went into
surgery, poor woman.

07:53.870 --> 07:55.478
My heart does go out to her.

07:56.717 --> 07:59.248
Could you tell me, the moment
the operation is finished?

07:59.381 --> 08:01.646
I don't want to trouble
Sarah, at a time like this.

08:01.672 --> 08:04.139
But we are so very
concerned, back at home.

08:06.572 --> 08:08.069
For the inconvenience.

08:08.533 --> 08:09.994
Oh, I couldn't.

08:33.787 --> 08:34.895
What was that about?

08:35.107 --> 08:37.520
Politics, my personal life.

08:37.546 --> 08:39.232
Seems, the two can't
be separated.

08:39.801 --> 08:41.318
However, for the
rest of the day,

08:41.344 --> 08:43.039
I just want to focus
on my grandson.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.633
Yeah, nothing else matters...

08:46.020 --> 08:46.910
.. today.

09:11.074 --> 09:13.081
You're the nurse, that
brought George Bligh in.

09:13.897 --> 09:15.068
Oh, yes.

09:15.518 --> 09:17.205
I'll never forget
your ingenuity.

09:17.408 --> 09:18.798
It was most impressive.

09:20.776 --> 09:23.025
Are you alright?
Eh, yes.

09:23.205 --> 09:25.798
My husband Rene, Dr. Nordmann

09:25.824 --> 09:28.019
He has been in neuro
surgery for hours now.

09:28.066 --> 09:29.167
Ah, yes.

09:29.405 --> 09:32.514
I saw the name Nordmann on the
surgery list. I did wonder.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.389
Your husband is in very good hands.

09:35.819 --> 09:38.623
Patrick Kelly is one of the best
neuro surgeons in the country.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.619
It's awful, isn't it?

09:49.108 --> 09:52.295
The helplessness, when
someone you love is ill.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.737
It seems somehow harder for us, when
we're so used to saving people.

09:56.853 --> 09:58.127
I'd do anything.

10:00.219 --> 10:02.273
I don't know your husband,
 Mrs. Nordmann,

10:02.727 --> 10:05.125
but it seems to me, he has
everything to live for.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.316
It's half the battle, sometimes.

10:09.477 --> 10:10.770
You're not alright.

10:10.795 --> 10:12.296
I haven't eaten, that's all.

10:12.992 --> 10:16.148
Yes, well, cafeteria
food is appalling.

10:16.543 --> 10:19.082
But it is possible to survive it,
if you know what to order.

10:19.637 --> 10:20.871
I have the nurses
bring you something.

10:20.895 --> 10:22.277
Please, you don't
have to do that.

10:22.402 --> 10:23.207
I insist.

10:37.951 --> 10:40.240
I've laid out your suit, and
I've ironed your shirt.

10:40.823 --> 10:41.877
For the christening.

10:42.119 --> 10:44.924
We can't go to Ash Park, we'll have
to head straight to the church.

10:45.283 --> 10:47.049
And what am I gonna say
to your family, huh?

10:48.655 --> 10:50.287
You don't have to say anything.

10:50.436 --> 10:52.045
So, pretend everything
is alright?

10:52.108 --> 10:55.517
No, but..
It was our dream, Anna.

10:57.358 --> 10:58.533
We have nothing.

11:00.276 --> 11:02.189
I have my trust-fund.

11:05.393 --> 11:06.228
That's your money.

11:06.252 --> 11:08.728
It's OUR money, and
we could invest it

11:08.752 --> 11:10.249
in the vineyard, maybe

11:10.666 --> 11:12.775
try again and hire some help.

11:12.987 --> 11:15.158
We could talk to father about
it, at the christening.

11:15.627 --> 11:17.353
And say what?
I can't provide for you.

11:17.573 --> 11:19.994
No Gino, we're in this together.

11:20.020 --> 11:21.309
We should talk to him, and..

11:21.325 --> 11:23.504
No, no, no, I would
not beg your family.

11:24.032 --> 11:25.758
Okay, Anna, we're not going.

11:26.094 --> 11:28.453
I'm going to my nephew's
christening, Gino !

11:28.458 --> 11:29.773
And how's that gonna look, huh ?

11:31.160 --> 11:32.480
Like I'm alone !

12:09.922 --> 12:10.738
Aunt Reggie.

12:11.133 --> 12:13.085
Bombs, strikes.

12:13.930 --> 12:17.263
News is so very dull these
days, don't you think?

12:18.785 --> 12:20.519
And what brings you
here, this morning?

12:21.520 --> 12:24.152
I was hoping, you'd given
some thought to our talk.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.562
I can't go back, not now.

12:30.328 --> 12:33.171
If you need to save
face, tell them I

12:33.406 --> 12:36.078
dragged you to the car,
and tied you to the roof.

12:40.496 --> 12:42.074
You won’t give up, will you?

12:42.723 --> 12:44.287
And neither should you.

12:52.711 --> 12:54.531
One step at the time, my dear.

12:54.563 --> 12:56.109
That's how we'll get through it.

12:59.129 --> 13:00.824
Here's the little prince-ling.

13:01.137 --> 13:03.664
Fed, changed,
dressed, ready to go.

13:04.602 --> 13:05.718
Thank you Rose.

13:05.744 --> 13:08.072
Is the parcel you received, the
good news you'd hoped for?

13:08.764 --> 13:10.622
It was a christening present.

13:11.748 --> 13:12.583
That's all.

13:16.959 --> 13:19.263
For all the little ones,
who never got a blessing.

13:21.252 --> 13:22.680
Has Anna arrived yet?

13:22.752 --> 13:25.466
Not yet, perhaps she's
meeting us at the church.

13:25.728 --> 13:26.974
Two Bligh's missing.

13:27.146 --> 13:29.341
It's a wonder, you're not
off gallivanting somewhere.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.310
Is that what you think of me?

13:31.873 --> 13:33.036
Oh, forgive me, I'm...

13:33.349 --> 13:34.935
I'm just used to
thinking of christenings

13:34.945 --> 13:37.005
as being joyous occasions.

13:37.201 --> 13:38.943
We're all doing our best, mother.

13:39.115 --> 13:40.083
Shall we?

13:41.396 --> 13:43.158
Actually I don't think I can..

13:45.506 --> 13:49.490
I can't do this.
We're all here, by your side.

14:08.385 --> 14:09.409
Are you ready?

14:14.210 --> 14:16.850
- James ?!
- Oh, at last.

14:18.159 --> 14:20.112
Not too late, I hope?

14:21.187 --> 14:22.295
Just in time.

14:25.128 --> 14:27.706
My sincere apologies, father.
We'll talk later.

14:30.796 --> 14:32.764
I am so glad you're here.

14:38.852 --> 14:40.070
I missed you.

14:41.403 --> 14:42.083
Thank you.

14:42.567 --> 14:44.387
I assume, you're
going to change?

14:44.934 --> 14:45.847
We'll wait.

14:50.748 --> 14:52.513
I told you it would be alright.

14:54.744 --> 14:56.105
Sanctify this water,

14:56.439 --> 14:58.658
to the mystical
washing away of sin.

14:59.286 --> 15:02.168
and grant that this child
to be baptised therein

15:02.201 --> 15:04.718
may receive the
fulness of thy grace.

15:05.502 --> 15:08.018
and ever remain in the
number of thy faithful..

15:34.653 --> 15:37.442
I baptise thee, in the
name of the Father

15:38.181 --> 15:39.266
and of the Son

15:40.814 --> 15:42.360
and of the Holy Ghost

15:43.224 --> 15:45.466
And I mark thee with
the sign of the Cross.

15:48.704 --> 15:49.665
Amen.

16:39.486 --> 16:40.440
No champagne?

16:40.839 --> 16:42.346
Let me fix that immediately.

16:42.425 --> 16:44.143
Oh, sweet James.

16:44.624 --> 16:46.444
I'm not certain,
I'm welcome here.

16:46.757 --> 16:48.971
Well, it's my son's christening
and I say that you are.

16:49.898 --> 16:50.932
To family.

16:52.335 --> 16:53.381
To you.

16:53.855 --> 16:58.370
Congratulations Mrs. Bligh,
on a beautiful baby.

16:58.417 --> 16:59.495
Thank you.

16:59.521 --> 17:02.260
He's such a mix of
his father and you.

17:02.284 --> 17:02.784
Yes.

17:03.144 --> 17:06.518
And are those long lashes
from your side of the family?

17:07.277 --> 17:09.511
Ehm, they must be.

17:10.644 --> 17:12.604
If you'll excuse me?

17:15.844 --> 17:19.851
Isn't it gracious of the Bligh's, to
invite us to such a happy occasion?

17:19.877 --> 17:21.718
Hmm, what do you reckon,
they call this?

17:22.314 --> 17:24.259
That a devil on horseback.

17:24.431 --> 17:26.517
I don't know whether
they eat it or ride it.

17:30.625 --> 17:33.784
I want to thank you for
bringing James home.

17:33.832 --> 17:35.183
He wanted to return.

17:35.277 --> 17:37.190
I only reminded him of that.

17:37.420 --> 17:39.209
I knew how important it was to you.

17:40.932 --> 17:41.978
I'm grateful.

17:42.959 --> 17:43.873
Thank you.

17:52.420 --> 17:55.287
You don't have to tell me,
what you're doing in Sydney,

17:55.811 --> 17:57.240
if you don't want to.

18:01.213 --> 18:03.142
How long are you
going to punish me?

18:04.635 --> 18:06.255
I thought you would
find that a relief.

18:06.725 --> 18:07.787
A relief?

18:08.248 --> 18:09.560
The longer I stayed away.

18:09.803 --> 18:10.873
Not at all.

18:12.772 --> 18:15.416
I will still honor my
duties at Ash Park.

18:16.045 --> 18:17.709
You don't have to
worry about that.

18:24.635 --> 18:26.041
Wasn't it lovely?

18:26.494 --> 18:28.291
- What?
- The christening.

18:28.693 --> 18:31.716
Oh, yes. I suppose it was.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.380
Anna.

18:34.175 --> 18:37.357
To be late for the ceremony.
And where is Gino?

18:38.088 --> 18:41.732
I'm sorry grandmother, but the whole
world doesn't revolve around the Bligh's.

18:44.440 --> 18:45.664
For goodness sake.

18:58.125 --> 19:00.515
I hear the surgery went
well, no complications.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.307
They tell me, they
won't know his

19:02.333 --> 19:04.228
mental state until
Rene wakes up.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.073
Unfortunately we don't
understand the brain

19:06.099 --> 19:07.724
nearly as well, as
we do the heart.

19:08.060 --> 19:09.239
Surgically speaking.

19:10.755 --> 19:12.188
You should go home,
get some rest.

19:12.470 --> 19:13.626
My place is here.

19:33.257 --> 19:35.702
There's nothing like a new
generation to emphasize

19:35.709 --> 19:37.780
how quickly time passes.

19:37.897 --> 19:41.018
Thankfully Andrew is in no hurry
to make me a grandmother.

19:42.913 --> 19:46.870
It must be such a relief to know
that Ash Park's future is assured.

19:47.351 --> 19:49.592
And that the Jew is
out of the picture.

19:50.921 --> 19:54.092
If only I can keep George
out of Regina's clutches.

19:54.206 --> 19:56.581
Is no one good enough
for your first born?

19:56.694 --> 19:59.552
He simply doesn't see
her, for who she is.

19:59.644 --> 20:01.870
You must feel some
sympathy for her?

20:02.557 --> 20:04.691
I mean, Charles was
a brute and...

20:05.011 --> 20:07.850
..to have a husband
die so violently.

20:08.827 --> 20:11.209
Your husband knew the Standish's
quite well, didn't he?

20:11.219 --> 20:14.100
Yes, he worked for Charles
in the diplomatic corps.

20:16.159 --> 20:18.229
You know how I
feel about gossip.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.858
Oh Prudence, I know you're
the soul of discretion.

20:23.530 --> 20:26.183
Regina never had a
shortage of suitors.

20:26.577 --> 20:31.057
When her husband fell ill,
the rumours were plentiful.

20:31.683 --> 20:33.723
I didn't know Charles was ill.

20:33.757 --> 20:37.522
Oh yes, gravely ill,
the last few months.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.163
It was quite a mystery,

20:39.358 --> 20:42.131
Even specialists didn't even
know, what to make of it.

21:02.987 --> 21:04.190
Sarah.

21:06.983 --> 21:08.288
Rene.

21:14.573 --> 21:15.850
I'm here.

21:21.343 --> 21:22.881
It is me.

21:29.827 --> 21:32.905
Everything is going
to be alright.

21:34.765 --> 21:35.577
Yes.

21:45.851 --> 21:48.640
Thank you, nurse.
I appreciate the call.

22:01.466 --> 22:03.255
I think you should slow down.

22:05.677 --> 22:07.028
I only meant...

22:08.420 --> 22:09.780
This isn't like you.

22:11.689 --> 22:13.212
Perhaps I'm not me.

22:13.884 --> 22:15.368
Carolyn, what's going on?

22:15.869 --> 22:17.048
Christening.

22:19.459 --> 22:21.646
There's obviously something
you're not telling me.

22:22.099 --> 22:24.482
Don't, just don't.

22:27.291 --> 22:28.767
Excuse me, Dr. Duncan.

22:28.793 --> 22:31.142
There's a telephone call for
you, Sydney hospital.

22:31.330 --> 22:32.173
Thank you.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.872
Oops, sorry.

22:40.365 --> 22:42.908
It's alright, no harm done.

22:44.685 --> 22:47.130
Carolyn, this is unseemly
behaviour, for a godmother.

22:47.170 --> 22:50.163
Ow, I'm celebrating my
nephew's christening.

22:50.346 --> 22:51.353
You're drunk.

22:51.955 --> 22:52.705
Quite.

22:59.143 --> 23:00.367
A word of warning.

23:00.627 --> 23:02.350
The last time you tried
to meddle where you

23:02.376 --> 23:04.439
weren't wanted, you
almost lost everything.

23:04.792 --> 23:06.292
What would George
say, if he knew

23:06.318 --> 23:07.836
you were back to your old ways?

23:09.593 --> 23:12.050
If I find something out about
your past that I think

23:12.076 --> 23:14.886
George needs to know,
I shall tell him.

23:15.910 --> 23:17.214
Well I wish you luck.

23:17.644 --> 23:18.945
There's nothing to find.

23:23.148 --> 23:24.062
Excuse me !

23:24.562 --> 23:25.499
Everyone ?

23:25.980 --> 23:27.652
If I may have your attention.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.744
I'd like to propose a toast,

23:30.051 --> 23:31.363
to my grandson,

23:32.054 --> 23:35.007
George Lewis Bligh.

23:35.250 --> 23:37.538
To George Lewis Bligh !

23:42.332 --> 23:43.722
George, a word?

23:47.871 --> 23:51.000
It's too early to tell
if it's a full recovery, but

23:51.504 --> 23:54.495
he's lucid and his
memory seems in tact.

23:55.152 --> 23:57.057
Well, they must be relieved.

23:57.715 --> 23:59.902
Everyone's found their
rightful place.

24:28.351 --> 24:30.528
Good news from Sydney, I gather?

24:30.812 --> 24:33.805
Yes, Dr. Nordmann's
operation was a success.

24:35.769 --> 24:37.808
I know that must be
bitter sweet for you.

24:39.765 --> 24:42.601
If it were me, I might have
trouble, wishing my rival well.

24:42.844 --> 24:44.068
He's not my rival.

24:44.972 --> 24:46.284
I couldn't agree more.

24:46.535 --> 24:48.331
He doesn't hold a candle to you.

24:49.758 --> 24:52.398
- I'm sorry I overstepped.
- Don't mention it.

24:56.160 --> 24:58.949
We both have things
in our past, George.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.984
Regrets, missed opportunities.

25:02.945 --> 25:04.497
But you have the
chance, to change

25:04.523 --> 25:06.434
the lives of everyone
in Inverness.

25:07.310 --> 25:09.872
Yes, indeed.

25:13.243 --> 25:14.329
Regina.

25:15.231 --> 25:16.418
I was hasty.

25:17.009 --> 25:19.516
It's clear, you would never
do anything to hurt James.

25:20.813 --> 25:22.610
Your exile is over, if
you'd like it to be.

25:24.009 --> 25:25.993
You want me to
return to Ash Park?

25:26.860 --> 25:29.649
With my entry into politics,
I must admit I found your...

25:29.958 --> 25:32.301
.. your guidance most helpful.

25:32.587 --> 25:34.110
Nothing would make me happier.

25:45.628 --> 25:49.081
120 over 80.
Couldn't ask for better.

25:49.206 --> 25:50.542
Model patient.

25:54.148 --> 25:55.655
We'll go home soon.

25:57.007 --> 25:57.706
Home?

25:59.066 --> 25:59.963
Paris.

26:27.376 --> 26:28.788
He only cried for half of it.

26:29.491 --> 26:31.663
Shall I put master George
down, for his sleep?

26:32.163 --> 26:35.085
He must be exhausted.
Thank you, Rose.

26:37.269 --> 26:38.190
Goodnight.

26:41.374 --> 26:43.827
It was a lovely day, after all.

26:44.593 --> 26:45.518
It was.

26:45.964 --> 26:48.409
I was happy, weren't you?

26:49.730 --> 26:51.557
I was wrong, to blame
you for what you did.

26:52.546 --> 26:54.702
You were going to do it
eventually, I see that.

26:54.725 --> 26:56.967
It was a stupid mistake.

26:57.608 --> 26:59.233
And it will never happen again.

26:59.366 --> 27:00.381
Of course it will.

27:01.116 --> 27:02.838
How could either of us continue?

27:03.573 --> 27:04.444
Livvie,

27:05.655 --> 27:07.655
we both want more, than
the other can give.

27:08.265 --> 27:09.721
What are you trying to say?

27:09.933 --> 27:12.588
We're a family, we have a son.

27:13.030 --> 27:14.526
Nothing will change that.

27:15.347 --> 27:17.728
But we must have
our own lives too.

27:18.901 --> 27:21.971
I think it's best,
if from now on

27:22.354 --> 27:24.159
we slept in separate bedrooms.

27:24.741 --> 27:26.131
And if I were to tell you,

27:26.460 --> 27:28.350
that's NOT what I want?

27:31.429 --> 27:33.092
I'll be coming and
going so often.

27:33.812 --> 27:35.706
Between running Ash Park
and trips to the city,

27:35.732 --> 27:36.958
I will only disturb you.

27:37.898 --> 27:39.545
This way, you'll get your rest.

27:41.941 --> 27:42.799
Goodnight.

28:00.835 --> 28:01.780
Carlo.

28:03.710 --> 28:07.155
I'm sorry Carlo,
Gino is not here.

28:07.273 --> 28:11.124
Oh, ehm, is it true,
the vines are dead?

28:11.983 --> 28:14.670
Yes, unfortunately.
Frost.

28:16.472 --> 28:18.346
I'm a simple man, uh,

28:18.761 --> 28:20.070
I was happy to help,

28:20.096 --> 28:21.991
but I don't have
money lying around,

28:21.999 --> 28:23.483
to.. to throw away.

28:23.559 --> 28:25.202
I don't understand.

28:25.624 --> 28:28.045
Gino tell me, he know
what he was doing.

28:28.062 --> 28:30.545
And he does, he'll be home soon.

28:30.710 --> 28:32.042
If there is to be no wine,

28:32.206 --> 28:33.924
I want my money back.

28:34.538 --> 28:36.307
Tell Gino we need to talk.

28:46.724 --> 28:48.722
Mind you don't
scratch the leather.

29:03.418 --> 29:06.472
George, may I come in?

29:12.027 --> 29:12.894
George?

29:26.629 --> 29:27.738
Wake up !

29:28.348 --> 29:29.316
Wake up !

29:31.043 --> 29:32.472
You need to sober up.

29:34.203 --> 29:35.742
I'll bring you up some tea.

29:36.031 --> 29:37.984
We can't have anyone
see you like this.

29:52.117 --> 29:55.070
- Where have you been?
- The pub.

29:56.258 --> 29:58.207
Carlo came here, looking for you.

29:58.543 --> 30:00.551
Something about
money you owe him.

30:00.707 --> 30:01.785
It's an investment.

30:02.414 --> 30:03.890
In the winery.

30:04.735 --> 30:07.359
So you take money from
him, but not from me?

30:07.809 --> 30:09.782
- Oh.
- Where are you going?

30:09.934 --> 30:12.090
Gino, talk to me, please !

30:12.332 --> 30:15.648
Now we're in debt, and
we don't have to be !

30:16.366 --> 30:18.461
This is MY decision too !

30:19.914 --> 30:20.934
So, how was it?

30:22.321 --> 30:23.409
The christening?

30:25.664 --> 30:26.781
It was fine.

30:27.387 --> 30:29.433
Did you tell them I
lost everything?

30:31.319 --> 30:33.875
Did you tell them your husband's
a hopeless fool, who...

30:34.063 --> 30:36.273
gambled everything
he had on a dream and..

30:37.407 --> 30:38.156
.. gone.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.109
How much do you owe Carlo?

30:58.778 --> 31:01.023
I must have got
the dosage wrong.

31:01.641 --> 31:04.226
It's forgotten, no
one else will know.

31:05.571 --> 31:06.816
I trust you're settled?

31:07.028 --> 31:08.569
It's strange, how
quickly I've come

31:08.595 --> 31:10.243
to think of this place as home.

31:13.529 --> 31:14.770
Your kindness...

31:15.279 --> 31:17.200
has made what I have to say...

31:17.872 --> 31:19.437
all the more difficult.

31:19.726 --> 31:21.648
I'd hoped, never to
have to tell you this.

31:21.765 --> 31:23.343
but honestly, I
don’t think I can..

31:23.617 --> 31:25.312
stay silent any longer.

31:25.531 --> 31:26.601
What is it?

31:27.757 --> 31:29.226
Perhaps I can help.

31:35.113 --> 31:36.812
I lied to you, George.

31:39.125 --> 31:40.741
I lied to everyone.

31:43.324 --> 31:45.569
That day, Rene
Nordmann shot you,

31:45.812 --> 31:47.377
what I told the police,

31:47.578 --> 31:49.382
wasn't the truth
of what happened.

31:50.515 --> 31:51.740
What is the truth?

31:53.554 --> 31:56.304
I went riding to clear
my head, when I saw you.

31:56.336 --> 31:57.402
What are you doing?

31:57.703 --> 31:59.218
He was pointing his gun at you.

31:59.238 --> 32:00.511
Point that gun away !

32:01.136 --> 32:02.837
Put the gun down !
NON !

32:05.230 --> 32:06.585
I knew I had to stop him.

32:06.617 --> 32:08.304
I tried so hard to stop him.

32:10.964 --> 32:12.198
It was intent.

32:14.120 --> 32:15.617
He wanted to kill you.

32:16.269 --> 32:17.643
He almost DID kill you and

32:17.652 --> 32:19.596
the thought, that he
will never have to pay

32:19.628 --> 32:21.432
is almost too much
for me, to bear.

32:23.386 --> 32:24.862
Why did you lie?

32:25.851 --> 32:27.139
I'm not blind.

32:29.359 --> 32:31.393
I know how much
Sarah means to you,

32:31.422 --> 32:33.913
how much you value
her happiness.

32:34.699 --> 32:38.100
If I told the truth, Rene would
still be in prison or...

32:38.847 --> 32:39.761
..worse.

32:41.335 --> 32:43.554
I thought it's what
you would want.

32:44.203 --> 32:45.218
Regina,

32:47.507 --> 32:48.609
what you did,

32:49.617 --> 32:51.089
shows such loyalty.

32:51.370 --> 32:54.034
- No.
- Yes, of course.

32:54.203 --> 32:56.244
I didn't do it out of loyalty.

32:57.894 --> 33:00.636
I didn't do it, to spare
Sarah Nordmann pain.

33:02.683 --> 33:04.384
Can't you see it, George?

33:05.394 --> 33:06.769
I did it because...

33:07.675 --> 33:09.716
..I would do anything for you.

33:35.664 --> 33:37.390
Brought you something to eat.

33:38.343 --> 33:39.432
And some coffee.

33:40.875 --> 33:41.632
Thanks.

33:48.304 --> 33:50.507
Ah Bella, leave it please, I'll do it.

33:51.617 --> 33:52.835
I can help.

34:15.464 --> 34:17.097
Visiting hours are over.

34:17.731 --> 34:19.699
I'd rather stay,
if that's alright.

34:19.726 --> 34:21.030
The patient needs his rest.

34:21.039 --> 34:22.331
I understand, but..

34:22.873 --> 34:25.768
It's hospital policy, I'm afraid.

34:25.793 --> 34:27.208
I won't bother anyone.

34:27.216 --> 34:29.809
I need to check on Mr.
Nordmann's progress.

34:33.922 --> 34:35.743
I make us a cup of
tea, I won't be long.

34:46.106 --> 34:48.801
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

34:52.501 --> 34:54.243
How are you feeling,
this morning?

34:55.888 --> 34:57.266
Much better, thank you.

34:57.856 --> 35:00.133
And thank you for your
discretion last night.

35:00.159 --> 35:02.167
- Please.
- And your honesty.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.250
And now, I would like
to be honest with you.

35:07.270 --> 35:10.418
Your loyalty to this
family, is genuine.

35:10.739 --> 35:13.414
I know that, I know that your
feelings toward me, have

35:13.532 --> 35:15.709
guided your actions in the past.

35:15.950 --> 35:18.922
I also know, that you'll stand
by me, no matter what.

35:19.446 --> 35:22.133
- It's all true.
- Please, let me finish.

35:23.380 --> 35:26.067
This may not be the
future you want,

35:27.630 --> 35:29.603
but I would like to propose,

35:30.966 --> 35:32.145
a partnership.

35:33.556 --> 35:36.157
You know what it means,
to have a political life.

35:36.923 --> 35:39.043
You know what you be
getting yourself in to.

35:39.692 --> 35:41.934
What exactly are you suggesting, George?

35:42.442 --> 35:43.327
A marriage...

35:44.005 --> 35:44.918
.. of sorts.

35:46.185 --> 35:47.106
Sir Richard is right.

35:47.122 --> 35:49.997
I need to declare myself as a
man with serious intentions.

35:50.023 --> 35:51.004
The sooner, the better.

35:51.349 --> 35:54.590
So, is this a proposal
or a business deal?

35:54.614 --> 35:55.286
Both.

35:57.622 --> 36:00.479
And I believe, we'll
both benefit greatly.

36:01.505 --> 36:02.729
We'll be partners.

36:04.817 --> 36:07.122
- Partners?
- Politically.

36:07.514 --> 36:09.504
We can take on this
challenge together.

36:10.067 --> 36:11.547
For the good of the country.

36:12.423 --> 36:14.055
You'll be my right hand.

36:16.458 --> 36:17.286
That's all?

36:17.411 --> 36:21.192
Sorry, I know it's not the
most romantic of proposals.

36:21.524 --> 36:23.805
Regina, we've both
been married before.

36:25.337 --> 36:27.508
And where did love
get either of us?

36:30.321 --> 36:33.243
Well George, you've taken
me quite by surprise.

36:33.454 --> 36:34.914
I don't know.

36:36.020 --> 36:37.653
I have to think it over.

36:37.724 --> 36:38.543
Of course.

37:43.763 --> 37:44.829
What is it ?

37:45.501 --> 37:48.571
Shall I set a plate for you at the
breakfast table, Mrs. Standish?

37:54.349 --> 37:55.606
Yes, thank you.

37:57.974 --> 37:59.184
I'm ravenous.

38:06.204 --> 38:07.071
Sister !

38:15.376 --> 38:16.829
- Stay back.
- No, let me help.

38:16.837 --> 38:18.063
Doctor’s doing everything he can.

38:18.084 --> 38:19.310
Let me go there !

38:19.336 --> 38:20.109
There's no pulse.

38:20.563 --> 38:22.055
He must have haemorrhaged.

38:23.633 --> 38:26.219
Pupils aren't responding.
He's gone.

38:26.274 --> 38:27.359
No,, Rene !

38:33.528 --> 38:35.161
GET YOUR HANDS OF ME  1!

38:41.640 --> 38:43.155
Please don't leave me now.

38:50.944 --> 38:52.280
Please Mrs. Nordmann.

38:52.358 --> 38:54.631
Please, it's no use. He's gone.

39:32.886 --> 39:34.104
Are you sure?

39:36.987 --> 39:39.291
Thank you, nurse.
How very sad.

39:39.616 --> 39:42.147
I'll let Mrs. Nordmann's
friends here know.

39:55.401 --> 39:56.899
Forgive the interruption.

39:57.444 --> 39:58.381
Not at all.

39:58.636 --> 40:00.893
I've given a lot of
thought, to what you said.

40:05.265 --> 40:06.077
And?

40:06.890 --> 40:09.999
You need someone by your side,
when you launch your campaign.

40:10.249 --> 40:12.420
The female voters will
want to see, that you're

40:12.635 --> 40:14.823
stable, committed,

40:15.683 --> 40:16.596
married.

40:17.722 --> 40:20.092
I want to stand beside
you as your wife.

40:20.999 --> 40:22.655
That's wonderful news, Regina.

40:23.077 --> 40:23.866
Thank you.

40:24.077 --> 40:25.522
I don't need a big wedding.

40:25.647 --> 40:28.288
Let's do it quickly, so we
can focus on your campaign.

40:28.756 --> 40:32.022
Together we can give the new
candidate a run for his money.

40:32.178 --> 40:35.225
You see, already you're making it
clear, this was the right decision.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.641
George, what's all this about?

40:43.545 --> 40:47.553
I appreciate your support,
in my recent endeavours,

40:48.085 --> 40:51.010
and I hope, you'll support
me in this one too.

40:51.702 --> 40:53.811
Regina and I are to be married.

41:00.543 --> 41:02.516
Congratulations, both of you.

41:02.605 --> 41:03.557
Thank you son.

41:03.566 --> 41:05.949
Yeah, that's wonderful.

41:06.687 --> 41:08.304
It won't be anything grand,

41:08.383 --> 41:10.531
just a civil ceremony,
for the family.

41:10.668 --> 41:12.242
And the press, of course.

41:12.320 --> 41:14.245
Sir Richard has smoothed
the way for us.

41:14.262 --> 41:15.339
Dear Dickie.

41:17.441 --> 41:20.434
Everyone in this family
has lost their minds.

41:21.464 --> 41:24.269
George, I should like to
speak to you, in private.

41:25.363 --> 41:26.587
Of course, mother.

41:34.691 --> 41:37.464
I will NOT allow this to happen.

41:37.519 --> 41:38.151
Mother.

41:38.168 --> 41:39.206
Is she blackmailing you?

41:39.215 --> 41:40.910
Please calm down, your heart !

41:42.015 --> 41:43.983
We're getting married,
because we both want to.

41:44.007 --> 41:45.530
Sir Richard wants you to.

41:45.539 --> 41:46.559
And he's right.

41:47.199 --> 41:49.956
If we wait until later,
it will appear contrived.

41:50.371 --> 41:52.019
We've received a
special dispensation,

41:52.027 --> 41:53.355
we are to be wed tomorrow.

41:53.420 --> 41:55.740
Well then, Carolyn is right,
you have lost your mind.

41:55.757 --> 41:57.904
If that's how you see
it, that's your choice.

41:57.920 --> 41:59.138
George, can't you see?

41:59.159 --> 42:00.490
You are being manipulated !

42:00.506 --> 42:01.685
Give me some credit !

42:01.783 --> 42:02.736
I'm not an imbecile.

42:02.745 --> 42:03.931
I know you're not !

42:03.939 --> 42:06.033
This is MY decision !

42:07.541 --> 42:09.095
I would like you at
the wedding tomorrow.

42:09.119 --> 42:11.650
But if you can't be there to
support me, then so be it.

42:19.923 --> 42:21.586
You can't marry her.

42:21.595 --> 42:23.086
You don't love her.

42:23.118 --> 42:25.391
- Love isn't everything.
- Of course it is.

42:25.407 --> 42:27.102
You're young and
happily married.

42:27.415 --> 42:29.938
I hope you never have to
understand what it means to...

42:30.821 --> 42:32.141
.. be practical

42:33.540 --> 42:36.344
It'll be a small wedding,
no pump and ceremony.

42:37.325 --> 42:40.496
If you'd like to be there,
you'd be most welcome.

42:44.977 --> 42:46.914
Goodnight, both of you.

42:57.399 --> 42:59.617
We'll find a way, won't we?

43:02.579 --> 43:03.594
We will.

43:19.087 --> 43:22.080
I should never have let
you go through this.

43:28.001 --> 43:30.313
And now, we are
apart, once again.

43:36.172 --> 43:38.219
It's time, sorry.

43:40.067 --> 43:41.051
Time?

43:41.286 --> 43:43.715
- To take him downstairs.
- What for?

43:44.399 --> 43:46.779
For the autopsy, so the
surgeon can determine..

43:46.805 --> 43:47.305
No.

43:48.016 --> 43:50.289
- It needs to be done.
- I don't care.

43:50.383 --> 43:52.758
- I understand you're upset.
- You're NOT taking him.

44:02.008 --> 44:03.609
I'm SO very sorry.

44:05.762 --> 44:07.488
If there's anything I can do?

44:09.176 --> 44:12.306
I lost him once before,
and I grieved for him.

44:16.274 --> 44:18.742
I don't know how to
do it, a second time.

44:21.118 --> 44:22.546
I can't even imagine.

44:24.473 --> 44:25.719
No autopsy.

44:26.665 --> 44:27.297
We're Jewish.

44:27.305 --> 44:29.539
He needs to be buried
as soon as possible.

44:30.278 --> 44:31.570
I'll let them know.

44:53.993 --> 44:56.047
How will I find you now?

45:13.008 --> 45:15.078
He isn't going through
with it, is he?

45:16.192 --> 45:17.809
It seems that he is.

45:19.083 --> 45:20.783
What are you going to do?

45:22.387 --> 45:23.656
I don't know.

45:27.188 --> 45:28.945
Seems we're not as in
control of life...

45:28.954 --> 45:30.587
..as we'd like to think.

45:30.985 --> 45:33.180
- Are we, mother?
- No.

45:35.059 --> 45:38.535
But it's how we respond to
life's surprises, that counts.

45:41.758 --> 45:45.246
I do hope that eventually, you'll
tell me what's bothering you.

45:46.770 --> 45:48.356
One day, perhaps.

45:51.223 --> 45:52.992
Darling, whatever it is...

45:54.020 --> 45:55.410
.. have courage.

45:56.626 --> 45:58.566
You've always been
such a brave woman.

45:59.004 --> 46:00.793
More than I can say for myself.

46:01.215 --> 46:02.723
Not so brave.

46:03.618 --> 46:04.842
Of course you are.

46:06.985 --> 46:08.563
More than you know !

46:41.989 --> 46:44.302
I know he's in, I
have to see him.

46:44.688 --> 46:46.195
One moment, please.

46:47.024 --> 46:49.676
Sir Richard, Miss Bligh
is here to see you?

46:49.692 --> 46:50.644
Yeah, alright.

46:51.051 --> 46:52.313
He wants you to go in.

46:53.774 --> 46:55.543
Good to see you, sit down.

46:55.973 --> 46:57.488
Now, did you bring the proposal?

46:57.514 --> 46:59.691
I think it's a bloody good idea.

46:59.809 --> 47:01.918
I don't care about my proposal.

47:01.973 --> 47:03.359
Well, what am I paying you for?

47:03.376 --> 47:05.289
You're not, I resign !

47:05.352 --> 47:06.781
Don't be such a dill.

47:09.209 --> 47:11.412
You won't get away, with
what you did to me.

47:11.701 --> 47:14.259
And what exactly is
it, you think I did?

47:14.611 --> 47:17.080
I imagine, the police
will call it rape.

47:17.104 --> 47:19.599
Hah, don't be such
a bloody child !

47:19.619 --> 47:20.787
Excuse me !

47:20.860 --> 47:22.891
Well, you invite me
into your apartment...

47:23.173 --> 47:24.590
..drunk, wanton.

47:24.809 --> 47:26.590
If you've changed your mind,
that's not my problem.

47:26.595 --> 47:29.410
That's not what happened,
and you know it !

47:29.582 --> 47:31.519
But you're hardly
the Virgin Mary,

47:31.536 --> 47:33.887
I didn't do anything, you
haven't done before.

47:35.446 --> 47:37.273
I will go to the police.

47:37.765 --> 47:39.670
The press too, if I have to.

47:43.114 --> 47:44.610
Who will believe you ?

47:45.141 --> 47:48.305
Who will take your
word, against mine?

47:49.254 --> 47:52.184
They'll call you a tramp.

47:53.090 --> 47:55.680
Drag your name through the mud.

47:56.864 --> 48:00.754
Ruin your brother's career
into the bargain, hmm?

48:07.153 --> 48:09.242
Why don't you go
back to Inverness?

48:09.336 --> 48:11.586
Back to your country doctor.

48:11.610 --> 48:13.312
You're not gonna make it here.

49:16.867 --> 49:17.870
Ash Park.

49:19.136 --> 49:21.022
Good afternoon doctor Duncan.

49:22.468 --> 49:25.022
I think he's just leaving,
I'll go and fetch him.

49:31.511 --> 49:35.706
Mr. Bligh, a telephone call
for you, from Dr. Duncan.

49:35.933 --> 49:38.007
I'm afraid, we really
don't have time.

49:38.945 --> 49:41.030
Ah yes, tell him I'll call
him back, when I return.

49:41.091 --> 49:42.796
After the wedding.
Yes, Sir.

49:44.320 --> 49:47.929
Drive quickly, I cannot wait
to become the next Mrs. Bligh.

50:36.466 --> 50:38.512
I call upon the
persons here present,

50:38.538 --> 50:40.891
to witness that I,
George Robert Bligh,

50:40.917 --> 50:42.813
take Regina Margareth Standish

50:42.845 --> 50:45.266
to be my lawful, wedded wife.

50:48.657 --> 50:50.743
I call upon the
persons here present,

50:50.769 --> 50:52.417
to witness that I,

50:52.457 --> 50:54.293
 Regina Margareth Standish,

50:54.488 --> 50:56.667
take George Robert Bligh

50:56.693 --> 50:58.666
as my lawful, wedded husband.

51:02.248 --> 51:05.802
Congratulations, I now
pronounce you man and wife.

51:12.283 --> 51:13.576
Mr. and Mrs. Bligh.
