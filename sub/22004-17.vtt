00:05.373 --> 00:07.541
*

00:10.144 --> 00:12.413
*

00:21.855 --> 00:24.392
This is degrading, right?

00:24.425 --> 00:26.494
I feel like this is degrading
and itchy.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.529
No one forced you
to wear it.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.831
I can't believe women had
to wear this 200 years ago.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.600
I hate men.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.602
No, you hate
19th-century men.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.770
Otherwise, we wouldn't be trying
to find a costume party.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.572
Which apparently we can't find.

00:38.606 --> 00:41.642
Where you'd get
that map, anyways?

00:41.675 --> 00:43.111
Serena in accounting.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.778
She said it was super exclusive,
but worth it.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.547
MAN:
Argh! You scalawag!

00:59.360 --> 01:03.631
There should be a door
here somewhere.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.168
I don't like this, Darla.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.636
Let's just go.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.204
Look, it's right there.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.342
Let's just go.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.509
Wait.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.278
Darla...

01:21.649 --> 01:23.617
Darla.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.753
One more try.

01:34.695 --> 01:37.365
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:37.398 --> 01:39.833
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:39.867 --> 01:42.536
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:42.570 --> 01:43.571
* How, how, how, how

01:43.604 --> 01:45.673
* Hey, hey

01:51.779 --> 01:53.414
* You gotta come on.

01:55.449 --> 01:59.387
What's the joke? New Orleans
has 365 days and 423 festivals?

01:59.420 --> 02:01.555
What don't you guys
celebrate here?

02:01.589 --> 02:04.658
Yeah, well, Pirate Fest
isn't one of my favorites.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.294
How come?
I don't know.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.662
Smuggling,
debauchery, murder.

02:08.696 --> 02:09.930
What's next, Slave Days?

02:09.963 --> 02:11.765
I told you.
You're grumpy.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.935
I am not grumpy.
Oh, yes, you are.
Have been for a while.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.171
You and me,
we used to go out all the time

02:17.205 --> 02:18.339
when we first became roommates.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.707
We were clubbin', partying.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.375
Now it's like
pulling teeth with you.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.177
Well, maybe
I don't like you anymore.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.179
You ever consider that?
Nope. Not possible.

02:25.213 --> 02:27.215
I'm the best friend anybody
can have, and you know it.

02:27.248 --> 02:30.351
No, but seriously,
what's going on?

02:30.384 --> 02:32.620
Girl, I don't know.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.223
But when I figure it out,
I'll let you know.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.757
Okay.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.362
And the name of the victim is

02:41.395 --> 02:43.231
Lieutenant Commander
Elaine Dodd.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.933
Oceanographer
out of Stennis Space Center.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.968
Well, according to her I.D.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.971
Found the wallet in the
purse in the warehouse.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.973
Her purse-- so not a robbery.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.942
Well, that's your area
of expertise,

02:54.975 --> 02:56.710
but no, I don't think it was.

02:56.744 --> 02:57.778
Whatever the reason,

02:57.811 --> 02:59.713
was a brutal death.

02:59.747 --> 03:02.683
Beaten severely,
stabbed several times.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.785
Could be some sort
of message killing.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.788
However, the initial wounds
were not mortal.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.790
You're thinking maybe
she was tortured first?

03:09.823 --> 03:11.225
It's possible.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.861
What they did
to the poor woman's arm.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.764
That was done postmortem.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.799
I suspect they
hung her upside down

03:18.832 --> 03:23.404
to make sure they peel
the epidermis in one piece.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.438
And if they did,

03:24.472 --> 03:25.873
then they knew
what they were doing.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.875
Yeah, and it means they
had a specific reason

03:27.908 --> 03:29.810
to do it, but why?

03:29.843 --> 03:31.679
Don't have the answers yet;
maybe when I

03:31.712 --> 03:33.914
get her back to autopsy.
Can't be a coincidence

03:33.947 --> 03:36.784
that this happened right near
the pirate festival, can it?

03:36.817 --> 03:38.652
Well, it certainly happened
during that time.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.921
I estimate her T.O.D.
at right around midnight.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.357
What was the commander doing
here, and why would someone

03:43.391 --> 03:44.958
want to take off
half her arm?

03:48.729 --> 03:51.532
According to her C.O.,
Lieutenant Commander Dodd

03:51.565 --> 03:53.734
took leave to go
visit her father

03:53.767 --> 03:55.269
in Florida two days ago.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.837
But her credit card records
show different.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.672
She never left Louisiana.

03:58.706 --> 04:01.609
All right, Percy, see if you
can track down Elaine's father.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.612
But if you get ahold of him,
don't tell him what happened.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.847
CACO should
break the news.
Understood.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.982
Nothing much
to what she was working on

04:09.016 --> 04:12.353
at the Stennis Space Center--
mapping the last 300 years

04:12.386 --> 04:13.721
of Gulf shore movements,

04:13.754 --> 04:15.456
trying to predict and plan
for the future.

04:15.489 --> 04:16.790
Pretty mundane sounding.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.726
She have any skeletons
in her closet?

04:19.660 --> 04:21.429
You know, skeletons, closet...

04:22.863 --> 04:24.865
I was just going
with the pirate theme.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.900
Pirate Fest... which
celebrates the legend

04:26.934 --> 04:29.437
of gulf pirates and privateers
burying their stolen goods

04:29.470 --> 04:30.771
all over New Orleans.

04:30.804 --> 04:31.905
Well, look at you.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.273
You know about pirates?

04:33.907 --> 04:35.809
Continue.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.645
Nothing in Elaine's closet,

04:37.678 --> 04:40.481
personally or professionally,
as far as I can see.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.783
I mean, perfect evaluations,
perfect credit...

04:42.816 --> 04:44.918
About as clean as it gets.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.053
She must have been
into something

04:46.086 --> 04:47.621
to get murdered
like that.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.790
It's up to us to
figure out what it was.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.926
There is one anomaly,
but it's not much.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.862
All right?
She focused her mapping

04:54.895 --> 04:56.930
all on Grand Isle.

04:56.964 --> 05:00.067
Even spent a lot of her free
time there, too, researching...

05:00.100 --> 05:03.504
Jean Lafitte.
As a matter of fact, yeah.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.739
Grand Isle was the base
of his pirate operations

05:05.773 --> 05:08.609
before the War of 1812,
along with Grand Terre.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.646
All right, maybe I liked pirates
when I was a kid.

05:12.680 --> 05:13.847
Tease me, you're fired.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.549
Didn't say a word.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.886
I, um, just got off with NOPD.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.854
NOPD? I thought you were looking
for Elaine's father.

05:20.888 --> 05:23.824
I was, but he popped up
on the DOD database.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.694
Apparently,
he's an ex-Green Beret, and...

05:26.727 --> 05:28.596
he reported
his daughter missing,

05:28.629 --> 05:32.800
both to the Navy and in person
at the local NOPD office.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.668
Still want me
to call CACO?

05:34.702 --> 05:36.537
No. If he traveled
all the way from Florida,

05:36.570 --> 05:38.005
he knows something's wrong.

05:38.038 --> 05:41.141
A father deserves
to know the truth.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.611
It'd be better
if it came from us.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.679
So, all right, you two
keep digging into Elaine.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.081
She was killed and mutilated
for a reason.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.883
I want to know why.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.820
MAN:
She called,

05:52.853 --> 05:55.789
left me a voice mail
about visiting me.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.725
But then when
she never showed...

05:57.758 --> 06:00.794
I'm telling you, Mr. Dodd,
you don't have to do this.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.863
We already have
a positive I.D.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.798
No, I need to see her.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.000
It's the right thing to do.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.838
This is Dr. Wade--
she's a friend.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.440
Mr. Dodd.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.841
I'm so sorry for your loss.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.376
Thanks.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.062
*

06:38.932 --> 06:40.968
You, uh...

06:41.001 --> 06:44.037
have any idea who did this?

06:45.238 --> 06:46.674
Dr. Wade?

06:46.707 --> 06:48.509
Oh. Excuse me.

06:53.714 --> 06:57.918
So I was hoping that
you would help us...

06:57.951 --> 06:59.653
Mr. Dodd.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.855
Your daughter
Elaine called you--

07:01.889 --> 07:04.625
any idea... what
it was about

07:04.658 --> 07:06.894
or why she wanted
to go to Florida?

07:06.927 --> 07:08.729
I don't know.
She just sounded very excited

07:08.762 --> 07:10.130
to tell me something.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.732
Surprised me.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.066
Surprised you how?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.903
Elaine and I weren't very close.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.905
We didn't talk much.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.907
Do you have any kids,
Agent Pride?

07:19.940 --> 07:22.743
Daughter. In college.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.913
Well, I hope you're closer
to her than I was to Elaine.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.649
Still, you... said she
was excited about something.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.951
Any idea what?
All I can think of

07:30.984 --> 07:33.821
is that it must have had
something to do with, uh...

07:33.854 --> 07:36.724
a treasure hunt.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.793
A... a treasure hunt?

07:39.827 --> 07:42.496
Even though we didn't talk,
Elaine and I would, uh,

07:42.530 --> 07:45.599
exchange ideas and clues
in e-mails online

07:45.633 --> 07:47.067
every once in a while.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.037
Pretty much the only thing
we had in common.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.673
Dwayne.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.008
I think you
should see this.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.645
Excuse me.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.854
What have you got?

08:06.887 --> 08:08.756
SEBASTIAN: Actually,
I'm not sure.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.691
But it might help
us understand

08:10.724 --> 08:13.060
why the killer
skinned Elaine's...

08:13.093 --> 08:14.562
arm.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.200
It's okay. Go ahead.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.902
Uh, looks like Elaine

08:21.935 --> 08:23.604
might have had
some kind of tattoo.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.038
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, but
not your typical tattoo,

08:25.072 --> 08:27.274
like a rose or "Mom" or
Batman, which is actually

08:27.307 --> 08:30.177
very typical in geek circles...
Just tell them what
you found, please.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.746
So, the mechanized needles
that are used in tattooing,

08:32.780 --> 08:35.248
they actually inject ink into
the second layer of skin, too.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.050
So theoretically,

08:37.084 --> 08:38.886
we should be able to recreate
the tattoo itself.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.088
And did you?
Yes and no.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.925
I have no idea what that is.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.894
Oh. It's a curious choice
for a tattoo,

08:46.927 --> 08:48.729
but if we could just figure out
what it meant...

08:48.762 --> 08:50.631
They're coordinates.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.066
That's why Elaine called.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.936
She must have finally
figured out how to find it.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.270
Find what?

08:57.304 --> 08:58.772
If I'm correct,

08:58.806 --> 09:02.142
the Napoleon Fleur-de-Lis.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.311
Gifted to New Orleans

09:04.344 --> 09:06.213
as part
of the Louisiana Purchase.

09:06.246 --> 09:10.017
But believed stolen
by Jean Lafitte.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.052
Jean Laf...? You mean
like the pirate Jean Lafitte?

09:12.085 --> 09:13.754
The Napoleon Fleur

09:13.787 --> 09:16.724
is what the city flag is
rumored to be based on.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.759
But I never thought
it really existed.

09:18.792 --> 09:21.061
I was beginning to think
it didn't exist, either.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.664
That's why I gave up
looking for it.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.867
But apparently,
Elaine never did.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.069
Well, maybe her job at Stennis,
mapping shore movements

09:29.102 --> 09:30.838
around Grand Isle,
helped her

09:30.871 --> 09:32.873
find a clue...
Wait, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.107
Time out,
time out.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.843
Are you saying
that your daughter

09:35.876 --> 09:38.245
tattooed a treasure
map on her arm?

09:38.278 --> 09:41.348
They're more like coordinates
that could lead to the map.

09:41.381 --> 09:44.217
Which could lead
to the Napoleon Fleur

09:44.251 --> 09:45.886
Theoretically.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.255
But there's also probably
many more steps.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.224
Lafitte would have made it
almost impossible to find,

09:51.258 --> 09:53.861
because it was so valuable.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.028
Unless...

09:55.062 --> 09:57.264
you followed all the clues.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.901
Sebastian.
Yeah?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.803
Think you can figure out
where the compass is pointing?

10:02.836 --> 10:05.205
Yeah, now that I know
what it is, yeah.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.279
PRIDE:
Eyes open, killer or killers

10:12.312 --> 10:14.381
must have skinned Elaine's arm
for the coordinates, too.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.416
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, it's not easy
deciphering them, though.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.652
I mean, frankly, I don't even
know if this is right.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.287
It's a good possibility, though.
The church predates Lafitte.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.289
Attic's never
been renovated.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.925
Makes sense he'd
bury a clue there.
It also makes sense

10:24.958 --> 10:27.728
why they tore up Elaine's arm--
so no one else could find it.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.831
Well, whatever
the next clue is,

10:30.864 --> 10:32.232
it's got to be
around here somewhere.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.134
At least, according to
these coordinates.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.837
Still, it's kind of cool,
though, right?

10:36.870 --> 10:38.371
I've never been on
a treasure hunt before.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.773
Not a treasure hunt, Sebastian.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.241
It's a murder investigation.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.176
Right, yeah. Game face.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.745
Sebastian?

11:22.415 --> 11:24.084
:
They got away.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.318
You okay?

11:25.352 --> 11:27.387
Yeah, you got to
take a look at this. Come here.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.757
It looks like there's
a secret compartment

11:29.790 --> 11:30.891
underneath the statue.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.059
We must have
scared them away

11:32.092 --> 11:34.427
before they had a chance to
move it. Here, come here.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.331
Easy. Easy.

11:48.976 --> 11:50.243
Something's in there.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.311
Yeah.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.323
*

12:16.403 --> 12:17.871
What is that?

12:17.905 --> 12:21.241
A puzzle book.
I think.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.910
Definitely something

12:22.943 --> 12:24.377
that pirates used to use

12:24.411 --> 12:26.213
to hide things.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.048
Look, there's a Fleur-de-Lis...
Yeah.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.349
...carved on it--
and I think, what is--

12:29.382 --> 12:30.483
looks like
some kind of signature.

12:30.517 --> 12:31.885
PRIDE:
Jean Lafitte.

12:34.354 --> 12:38.058
It looks like we beat
whoever killed Elaine

12:38.091 --> 12:41.228
to the first clue.
Which means...

12:41.261 --> 12:44.297
we are on a real-life
treasure hunt.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.848
GREGORIO: Just got back
from Elaine's apartment.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.449
Not much there other than
a lot of books on Lafitte,

13:02.482 --> 13:04.918
old letters, Gulf maps.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.253
Looks like she was
obviously obsessed

13:06.286 --> 13:07.821
with finding something
all right.

13:07.855 --> 13:09.522
The Napoleon
Fleur-de-Lis.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.358
If her father's right.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.927
Obviously worried she
was being followed, too.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.363
Otherwise, why tattoo
the clue on her arm?

13:16.396 --> 13:18.932
Well, it didn't stop the killers
from still getting it, though.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.201
Yeah, well, at least we got
the next clue before they did.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.169
What is this thing?

13:22.202 --> 13:26.239
This is a handmade
puzzle book.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.941
It's pretty intricate, too.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.342
We just need to
decode the ciphers,

13:29.376 --> 13:31.111
then we can open it up,
get the next clue.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.181
Mm-hmm.
Something tells me
it'd be much easier

13:34.214 --> 13:35.182
to use a knife.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.583
Hey, stop!
Hey, ow.

13:36.616 --> 13:37.851
Easy.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.186
All right?

13:39.219 --> 13:40.854
I don't know everything
about pirates,

13:40.888 --> 13:42.956
but I know about these things.
And if they're not opened

13:42.990 --> 13:44.257
exactly how they're
supposed to be opened,

13:44.291 --> 13:46.193
they could self-destruct.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.028
There could be, like, an acid
capsule inside there
or something.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.329
Are you kidding?
Is he kidding?

13:49.362 --> 13:51.398
No, he's not kidding.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.934
Pirates created
elaborate clue trails

13:53.967 --> 13:56.303
that only those who knew
them best could follow.

13:56.336 --> 13:59.139
It Lafitte really did
bury the Napoleon Fleur,

13:59.172 --> 14:01.374
his clue trail could be
more elaborate than most.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.977
So, we have to
follow the clues

14:04.011 --> 14:05.946
in order to find
the Fleur
BOTH: Yeah.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.614
And, hopefully,
Elaine's killers...
Okay.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.316
...since they're
after it, too.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.951
All right, keep
working on that thing.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.253
Got to figure out
how to open it.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.955
This is ridiculous.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.890
Ghost stories, treasure hunts.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.625
So what's next,
the frickin' tooth fairy?

14:20.327 --> 14:22.062
What do you got?
Surveillance spotted

14:22.095 --> 14:24.264
those two jokers who shot at you
running out of the common.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.632
SONJA: We used Patton's
facial recognition

14:25.665 --> 14:27.134
software to identify
one of them.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.902
Nathan Hendricks.

14:28.936 --> 14:31.038
He's been in and out of prison
since he was in juvie.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.039
Any connection to the victim?

14:32.072 --> 14:33.306
Not that we can find.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.275
More of a mercenary,
apparently, hired gun.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.010
You need some dirty work done?

14:37.044 --> 14:38.311
Call him.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.547
TOM: I bet I know
who called him, too.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.250
As well as who knows him.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.185
Mr. Dodd.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.654
Special Agents Percy
and Lasalle.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.422
What are you doing here?

14:49.456 --> 14:52.025
Trying to find
the Napoleon Fleur.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.393
Just like you.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.328
For my daughter.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.466
All right.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.336
We're listening.
I wasn't the only one

15:03.370 --> 15:05.338
looking for the Fleur back when.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.573
There were others.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.309
Like I said, it's worth a lot.
Millions.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.144
So, you know Nate Hendricks?
No.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.080
But I know who
he used to work for.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.348
A man who specializes
in deep-sea diving,

15:15.382 --> 15:16.483
sunken galleons.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.618
He might know something.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.987
What's his name?

15:20.020 --> 15:21.321
He won't meet with you.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.623
You're cops.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.092
But he might meet with me.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.560
Oh, no way,
that's way too risky.

15:27.594 --> 15:31.331
I may be an ex-Green Beret,
but I still know

15:31.364 --> 15:33.000
how to handle myself.

15:33.033 --> 15:36.436
Besides, you don't get the meet
without me.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.438
GREGORIO:
Pride,

15:38.471 --> 15:40.040
we might have a lead
on who helped Elaine

15:40.073 --> 15:41.308
get the coordinates
to the puzzle book.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.575
Yeah, an expert
on Jean Lafitte

15:42.609 --> 15:44.211
who works at the
Historical Society.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.413
Michelle Faucheux.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.316
According to Elaine's
phone record,

15:49.349 --> 15:51.351
she called her several times
in the last few days.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.619
That name ring any bell?

15:52.652 --> 15:54.421
No.
PRIDE: All right,

15:54.454 --> 15:55.722
go talk with her,
but watch your backs.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.390
Reasonable to assume
that the killers know

15:57.424 --> 15:59.359
that we're after the same thing
they are now.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.393
Copy that.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.498
All right, Mr. Dodd.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.234
Make your call.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.572
SEBASTIAN: Maybe she's not
getting enough sleep?

16:12.605 --> 16:14.441
Could be something to do
with Sonja's mom, you know?

16:14.474 --> 16:17.510
I mean, it's been what, a year
since Sonja's step-dad died.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.412
I doubt it.
They talk all the time.

16:19.446 --> 16:20.247
Very lovey-dovey.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.315
No, there's something else
bugging her.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.317
I-I just...
I don't know what.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.486
You know?
If only we had
someone who was, like,

16:26.519 --> 16:29.522
a profiler...
Shut up.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.458
Wait.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.523
Please, don't hurt me.

17:03.556 --> 17:04.724
Federal agents.
Who are you?

17:04.757 --> 17:06.459
Michelle.
M-My name's Michelle.

17:06.493 --> 17:09.829
Michelle?
Faucheux?

17:09.862 --> 17:11.131
Uh-huh.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.567
Okay, okay, it's all right.
You're safe now.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.403
Come here.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.837
Thanks.
Yeah, come on.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.539
Let's go over here.
I don't understand.

17:19.572 --> 17:20.673
How did you get here so fast?

17:20.707 --> 17:23.476
Well, actually, we were
coming to see you about a case.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.445
GREGORIO: Right.
Now, just, just breathe.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.413
Deep breath.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.415
Tell us what happened.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.650
I don't know, I was...

17:30.683 --> 17:33.520
I was just doing some research,
and-and these, these two guys

17:33.553 --> 17:35.422
just burst in here
yelling, screaming.

17:35.455 --> 17:38.391
And then they-they grabbed me
and shoved me in the closet

17:38.425 --> 17:39.692
and told me to
stay there or...

17:39.726 --> 17:41.561
or they'd kill me.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.130
Did you get a good look at them?

17:43.163 --> 17:44.197
Maybe, I...

17:44.231 --> 17:45.598
It all happened so fast, I...

17:45.632 --> 17:47.367
I heard them throwing things

17:47.400 --> 17:49.202
and breaking things...
Hey, listen, okay?

17:49.236 --> 17:51.504
We're gonna take care
of this now, okay?

17:51.538 --> 17:53.573
Do you, um...

17:53.606 --> 17:55.442
do you know somebody
named Elaine Dodd?

17:55.475 --> 17:56.509
Elaine, sure.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.512
We talk all the time. Why?
What did you talk about?

17:59.546 --> 18:01.514
Well, lately, mostly about
Jean Lafitte, the pirate.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.351
I'm sort of an expert on him
and his brother, Pierre.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.519
19th-century smuggling
and pirating and...

18:06.553 --> 18:08.755
When was the last time
you spoke to her?

18:08.788 --> 18:10.490
Oh, a couple of days ago,
I think.

18:10.523 --> 18:11.491
She was super excited.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.760
She's been looking
for Lafitte's puzzle book.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.363
Trying to find
the Napoleon Fleur

18:16.396 --> 18:18.565
Yeah. How did you know
about that?

18:20.533 --> 18:23.670
Did something happen to Elaine?

18:26.806 --> 18:30.577
TOM: Treasure hunting has become
way too dangerous.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.482
The terrorists looting
and destroying antiquities.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.684
Selling stolen artifacts
on the black market

18:37.717 --> 18:39.686
to fund their operations.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.488
It's all changed.

18:41.521 --> 18:44.791
It used to be more
about the hunt.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.659
Although, if you got lucky,

18:46.693 --> 18:48.561
you sure as hell could
strike it rich.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.230
Is that what
your daughter

18:50.263 --> 18:51.631
was hoping for?

18:51.664 --> 18:53.233
Elaine?

18:53.266 --> 18:55.635
No.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.171
She didn't care
about any of that.

18:58.205 --> 19:01.408
She just loved
the thrill of it all.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.243
The adventure.

19:03.276 --> 19:06.145
Hmm. Good for her.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.619
Maybe she also liked doing it
because you did?

19:15.555 --> 19:17.357
Maybe.

19:20.227 --> 19:22.329
Tommy!

19:23.696 --> 19:25.298
Whoa.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.536
Wait, what the hell's
going on here?

19:29.569 --> 19:30.570
Federal agents.

19:32.639 --> 19:33.673
Come on in.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.942
Preferably willingly.

19:35.975 --> 19:38.678
Just looking for a little
information, Mr. Sturgess.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.713
Tom here thought you
might be able to help.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.749
Help? Tom, what the hell's
going on here?

19:42.782 --> 19:44.384
They killed
Elaine, Quint.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.721
She was searching for
the Napoleon Fleur,

19:48.755 --> 19:49.856
and they killed her.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.691
Holy crap.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.460
You know them?

19:53.493 --> 19:56.696
Yeah, it's Nate Hendricks
and Billy Walton.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.465
Chief suspects
in Elaine's murder.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.732
Any idea who hired 'em?

19:59.766 --> 20:01.568
You, maybe?
STURGESS: No way.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.969
I haven't seen either
one of 'em in months.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.971
A year, maybe.
LASALLE: All right, then,

20:05.004 --> 20:06.205
who hired them?

20:07.540 --> 20:08.875
Tom, are you sure
they're after the Fleur?

20:08.908 --> 20:10.377
Positive.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.312
Why?
Why?

20:12.345 --> 20:14.681
The Fleur's one of the last
great undiscovered treasures.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.550
Means whoever it is
will do anything to get it.

20:17.584 --> 20:18.718
Especially if they think
they're close.

20:22.789 --> 20:23.823
Look,

20:23.856 --> 20:26.559
I'll give you what I know
on Hendricks and Walton,

20:26.593 --> 20:28.795
but I don't want anything else
to do with this.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.032
They won't let nothin'
stand in their way.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.734
Not even cops.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.745
Obviously, we're not gonna
take our eyes off you.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.714
You know, we got to
protect you, keep you safe.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.882
One of us, probably me, might
even have to save your life.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.419
Until then, uh, you're
gonna be safe here

20:52.452 --> 20:54.621
until we can find you
a-a place to stay.

20:54.654 --> 20:55.722
Here you go.
I mean,

20:55.755 --> 20:57.657
she can just
stay with me.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.292
Why would she stay
at your place?

20:59.326 --> 21:00.527
Oh, I don't know,
maybe because

21:00.560 --> 21:02.529
there's two NCIS agents
that live there.

21:02.562 --> 21:03.596
That doesn't make any sense.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.798
It makes perfect sense.
No, why would she stay...

21:05.832 --> 21:07.934
MICHELLE: Oh, my God.
Lafitte's puzzle book.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.769
How did you find it?

21:09.802 --> 21:10.770
SEBASTIAN:
Actually, uh,

21:10.803 --> 21:12.505
Elaine sort of did.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.607
It was her last clue
that led us to it.

21:14.641 --> 21:17.310
Led us to the killers, too,
just beat them to the punch.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.646
They can't find the
Napoleon Fleur without this,

21:19.679 --> 21:21.481
which means that they're
still gonna come after it.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.682
No, don't worry,

21:22.715 --> 21:24.817
we're not gonna let
anything happen to you.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.019
So, look, the-the sooner
that we open this book,

21:27.053 --> 21:29.088
the sooner that we can catch
whoever else is after it.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.823
Do you think you can help us?

21:30.857 --> 21:32.024
I'll try.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.695
You have to put the letters

21:35.728 --> 21:37.530
in the exact right order,
but the problem is

21:37.564 --> 21:38.631
it's more than likely...

21:38.665 --> 21:40.333
BOTH:
Le Chiffre Indechiffrable.

21:40.367 --> 21:41.401
Exactly.
Yeah.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.503
Exactly what

21:43.536 --> 21:44.771
Le Chiffre Indechiffrable.
I

21:44.804 --> 21:45.972
Yeah, for unbreakable code,

21:46.005 --> 21:47.940
which was invented by the
19th-century cryptographer...

21:47.974 --> 21:50.743
Blaise Vigenère, who was the
father of modern cryptography.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.712
But you need to-to know
that one key word.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.046
Right
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.915
And fast, too,
especially considering

21:55.948 --> 21:59.018
all the combinations that
modern day computers can do.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.620
What have you tried so far?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.955
Usual suspects, you know, uh,
Lafitte, both spellings,

22:02.989 --> 22:04.023
Orleans,

22:04.056 --> 22:05.725
Grand Isle.

22:05.758 --> 22:08.027
Wait, but, uh, Lafitte would've
left clues for his brother

22:08.060 --> 22:10.463
to find the Fleur and he
knew him better than anybody.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.965
Lafitte broke Pierre
out of the Cabildo

22:12.999 --> 22:14.066
when he was imprisoned there.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.102
Right. Okay, so Cabildo...
Mm-hmm.

22:16.135 --> 22:19.472
...could be one of the key words
to crack open the book.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.514
Fleur-de-Lis.

22:27.547 --> 22:29.749
Duh. Right. Okay. All right.
Right, right, right.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.419
Oh.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.687
Yeah, yeah.
All right.

22:43.496 --> 22:45.465
Uh, oh.
Yeah.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.468
Look at this.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.139
It's opening right up.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.074
GREGORIO:
Opening to what?

22:55.107 --> 22:55.975
A new page?

22:56.008 --> 22:58.611
No, it looks like
a-a different code.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.748
Okay, all right,
so what is this...

23:01.781 --> 23:04.517
Pride, hey. I have good news
and bad news.

23:04.551 --> 23:05.818
PRIDE:
Well, I got only bad news.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.754
Tom's contacts got us
enough information

23:07.787 --> 23:09.856
on the suspects to get
one of their cell phones.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.724
What's the bad news?
Traced the GPS,

23:11.758 --> 23:13.560
he or they are sitting
right down the street

23:13.593 --> 23:14.393
from you right now.

23:14.427 --> 23:17.063
Wait, what?
We have Michelle here.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.698
She just helped us
open the puzzle book.

23:18.731 --> 23:19.766
What do you want me to do?

23:19.799 --> 23:20.767
Protect her. We're on our way!

23:23.803 --> 23:26.939
Sebastian.
What's wrong?

23:26.973 --> 23:28.975
I think we're
about to be attacked.

23:55.234 --> 23:56.736
LASALLE: They're still
sitting there, King.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.539
Just waiting.
Yeah, but waiting for what?

23:59.572 --> 24:01.207
They've been out there
ever since we got back.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.543
Yeah, just let us
walk in, too.

24:03.576 --> 24:04.944
Thought they wanted
Jean Lafitte's book?

24:04.977 --> 24:05.878
Well, they do.

24:05.912 --> 24:08.047
I think they want to see
where it leads more.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.882
The Napoleon Fleur.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.918
PRIDE: Right. Maybe
they're hoping

24:11.951 --> 24:14.086
that we'll lead them to it.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.855
Hoping we'll solved
the puzzle for them.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.724
Well, I think we should
go out there and bust them.

24:17.757 --> 24:20.259
That won't necessarily help us
figure out who hired them,

24:20.292 --> 24:21.293
who's behind this.

24:21.327 --> 24:23.796
And if Elaine's father's
right about whoever it is,

24:23.830 --> 24:25.965
it's not somebody that we want
to be taking lightly.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.266
All right then.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.701
What's the plan?

24:28.735 --> 24:31.938
Plan is to let them think

24:31.971 --> 24:33.940
that their plan is working.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.875
Let them follow us,

24:35.908 --> 24:38.077
hopefully all the way
to the Fleur-de-Lis.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.812
That when you think
whoever's behind this

24:39.846 --> 24:41.914
will show their face?
Treasure like that,

24:41.948 --> 24:44.984
hard to believe he wouldn't want
to be there to see it.

24:45.017 --> 24:49.121
Now all we got to
do is find it.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.123
This is crazy.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.760
No, actually,
this is fun.

24:57.764 --> 25:00.667
I think it's this.
Making any progress?

25:00.700 --> 25:02.535
Just with sleep
deprivation.

25:02.569 --> 25:04.571
Actually, I think we might be
narrowing down on the next clue.

25:04.604 --> 25:05.772
We are?

25:05.805 --> 25:07.874
Yeah, yeah, this is clearly,
it's-it's some kind of a map,

25:07.907 --> 25:10.309
but if we can just figure out
what it's a map to...

25:10.342 --> 25:12.144
We should be able to
figure out which letters

25:12.178 --> 25:13.012
to spin in which order,

25:13.045 --> 25:15.582
which should open,
then unlock this page.

25:15.615 --> 25:16.983
It should lead us
to the Fleur.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.251
Your mouth to God's ears.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.553
There's some kind
of a-a riddle

25:20.587 --> 25:21.988
engraved here.

25:22.021 --> 25:25.592
We're assuming that it's
a-a clue to the location.

25:27.059 --> 25:28.828
"Move as the clock BLF six."

25:28.861 --> 25:30.229
BLF six...
Yeah, it's got to be

25:30.262 --> 25:32.632
some kind of a-a code that
Lafitte left for his brother

25:32.665 --> 25:33.900
that only he could
figure out, but, you know,

25:33.933 --> 25:35.935
we've gone through everything
that we know about Lafitte...

25:35.968 --> 25:37.937
But we think that we know
what B.L. stands for.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.573
Barthelemy Lafon.

25:40.607 --> 25:42.208
One of the city's
original planners.

25:42.241 --> 25:43.342
Someone who joined
forces with Lafitte,

25:43.375 --> 25:45.612
became a pirate

25:45.645 --> 25:47.747
after he was rebuffed
by the government, too.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.282
You know your history,
Agent Pride.

25:50.316 --> 25:51.684
No, he knows pirates.

25:51.718 --> 25:54.286
I remember learning
about Lafon in school.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.089
Didn't he design
Saint Louis Cemetery Number 1?

25:57.123 --> 26:00.259
Yeah, I think you're right.
Pull up the cemetery map.

26:00.292 --> 26:02.094
Yeah, yeah.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.095
PRIDE:
If I'm right,

26:03.129 --> 26:08.134
and if the clue is a map
of the cemetery, then...

26:08.167 --> 26:11.137
"F"... six...

26:13.906 --> 26:15.642
Could be...

26:15.675 --> 26:16.809
Zoom in.
Yeah.

26:20.647 --> 26:22.314
Barthelemy Lafon's crypt.

26:22.348 --> 26:25.217
And that's where Lafitte wanted
his brother Pierre to start.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.788
That's the map.
That's where we start.

26:28.821 --> 26:31.190
Yes.
All right.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.025
All right, Chris, Sonja,
I want you backing up

26:33.059 --> 26:34.827
Miss Faucheux.
Gregorio, Sebastian,

26:34.861 --> 26:37.697
don't let them or the suspects
out of your sight

26:37.730 --> 26:38.731
if they follow.

26:38.765 --> 26:41.400
Hey, stay in constant contact,
you understand?

26:41.433 --> 26:42.835
Don't forget who
we're dealing with.

26:42.869 --> 26:44.403
Yeah. Roger that.
Come on.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.672
All right, uh, Patton's
got that scanner,

26:45.705 --> 26:48.340
you know, the one that can clone
phones when you're close enough.

26:48.374 --> 26:49.742
Take that with you.
Right.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.077
Try and tap into the suspects,

26:51.110 --> 26:52.712
see who they're talking to,
I like it.

26:52.745 --> 26:53.946
What are you gonna do?

26:53.980 --> 26:55.648
I'm gonna coordinate
what you find,

26:55.682 --> 26:57.083
so that I can try
and use it to figure out

26:57.116 --> 26:59.118
who's behind this. Go.
Okay.

27:09.428 --> 27:12.398
There it is,
Barthelemy's crypt.

27:12.431 --> 27:15.167
Okay, now what?

27:15.201 --> 27:18.270
Now, we got to figure out
how to find the first letter.

27:23.209 --> 27:24.677
Hey, uh,

27:24.711 --> 27:26.245
you might want to
open that book.

27:26.278 --> 27:29.081
Hmm? Right. Yes.
Yeah.

27:29.115 --> 27:30.817
You like her, don't you?

27:30.850 --> 27:32.451
Pssh.
Come on,

27:32.484 --> 27:34.721
I'm not blind,
but you are, baby.

27:34.754 --> 27:35.822
What's that supposed to mean?

27:35.855 --> 27:38.758
She's smart,
attractive, adventurous.

27:38.791 --> 27:40.359
Only problem is, she plays
for the other team.

27:40.392 --> 27:43.262
My team.
No way.

27:43.295 --> 27:44.964
Yes, way. I'm telling you,
it's not me profiling,

27:44.997 --> 27:46.465
that's me knowing.

27:46.498 --> 27:47.934
All right, well, then,
riddle me this, Joker.
Yeah?

27:47.967 --> 27:49.401
Why has she been
flirting with me?

27:49.435 --> 27:51.370
You're cute.
She needs our help.

27:52.739 --> 27:54.306
I think I found something.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.407
Oh, did you find the letter?

27:55.441 --> 27:57.476
See the engraved Fleur-de-Lis
over the letter "L"?

27:57.509 --> 27:59.278
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

27:59.311 --> 28:00.980
Yeah, I see it. All right,
let's see. "L"...

28:02.915 --> 28:04.216
"L"...

28:04.250 --> 28:06.786
Something clicked.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.254
What now?

28:08.287 --> 28:10.222
"Move as the clock."
I'm guessing that means

28:10.256 --> 28:12.725
we go clockwise
to the next crypt on the map,

28:12.759 --> 28:14.360
but remember it's got to be
1820 or earlier.

28:14.393 --> 28:16.695
Come on. Let's go.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.365
Hey, hey, hey. Look
at the bright side,

28:19.398 --> 28:22.802
I saved you a ton of money
on dinner and movies.

28:22.835 --> 28:24.771
Come on.

28:24.804 --> 28:25.838
Come on!

28:36.548 --> 28:37.984
LASALLE:
No way to keep an eye on

28:38.017 --> 28:40.820
Sebastian, Gregorio,
and Michelle,

28:40.853 --> 28:43.155
but as long as we got
an eye on the suspects,

28:43.189 --> 28:44.256
they should be okay.

28:44.290 --> 28:45.758
Yeah, I'm just
wondering why

28:45.792 --> 28:48.294
they're not that interested
in seeing them.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.095
How're they supposed to know

28:49.128 --> 28:50.362
when they've found
the next clue?

28:50.396 --> 28:51.864
We'll find out as soon as

28:51.898 --> 28:53.499
I get this joker to work.

28:55.401 --> 28:58.070
Look, I'm just wondering, uh...

28:58.104 --> 29:00.139
You're not mad
about anything, are you?

29:00.172 --> 29:02.174
What

29:02.208 --> 29:04.844
Well, I don't know,
I guess, uh...

29:04.877 --> 29:06.078
You know, we don't joke around

29:06.112 --> 29:08.480
or talk like
we used to.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.149
But it's probably
just me tripping.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.550
Don't worry,
it's got nothing

29:11.583 --> 29:15.788
to do with you, it's just... me.

29:15.822 --> 29:17.990
All right, you, uh...
want to talk about it?

29:18.024 --> 29:19.758
I don't.

29:23.595 --> 29:24.997
What do you need?
Thanks for coming.

29:25.031 --> 29:26.498
I know you got
a lot on your mind, but...

29:26.532 --> 29:28.367
What do you need?

29:28.400 --> 29:31.003
Your expertise.

29:31.037 --> 29:33.873
There can't be a lot
of treasure hunters out there

29:33.906 --> 29:36.442
willing to kill for
the Napoleon Fleur, right?

29:36.475 --> 29:40.512
True. I'll get in touch
with my contacts

29:40.546 --> 29:43.049
and try to narrow down
possible suspects.

29:43.082 --> 29:45.918
I'm hoping that what my team
finds will help us, too.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.820
Great.
Let's get to work.

29:47.854 --> 29:51.223
MICHELLE: The Fleur-de-Lis
is over the "M." Try the "M."

29:51.257 --> 29:53.092
That's it.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.293
What's that?

29:54.326 --> 29:56.863
That's an acid capsule.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.597
It's a good thing we
opened this the right way

29:58.630 --> 29:59.899
instead of with a butter knife.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.902
Okay. Congratulations.
You were right.

30:02.935 --> 30:05.804
MICHELLE: It looks like
the next clue is in French.

30:07.073 --> 30:08.074
What're you doing?

30:08.107 --> 30:10.376
Sending a picture to Pride.
He speaks French.

30:10.409 --> 30:11.477
So do I.
Let me see.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.412
Enter this last crypt

30:13.445 --> 30:15.848
to find the Fleur-de-Lis.

30:15.882 --> 30:18.017
That's it? It-it's here
in the cemetery?

30:22.421 --> 30:23.890
Wait. Where are they going?

30:23.923 --> 30:25.892
Pride just texted,
said Michelle told Sebastian

30:25.925 --> 30:26.792
the Fleur is here.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.995
Yeah, but the suspects
just received a text

30:29.028 --> 30:30.429
from somebody saying it's not.

30:30.462 --> 30:31.931
Can you see who sent the text?

30:34.633 --> 30:36.168
PRIDE:
Are you sure?

30:36.202 --> 30:38.437
Get in there.
Hurry. Find them.

30:38.470 --> 30:40.272
What's wrong?
Everything.

30:40.306 --> 30:44.576
Lasalle just intercepted a text
to the suspects, from Michelle.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.145
Wait, what?
Yeah.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.214
She tricked us.

30:48.247 --> 30:49.882
She made it look
like she'd been attacked,

30:49.916 --> 30:51.417
when she's been
behind it all along.

30:53.119 --> 30:54.520
GREGORIO:
Door's open?

30:54.553 --> 30:55.654
SEBASTIAN: Okay,
wait-- hold-hold on.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.890
Yeah, here-here, stand back,
stand back, just in case.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.971
There's nothing here.
Think it's buried?

31:12.004 --> 31:13.906
Uh, maybe. Hey, Michelle?

31:15.541 --> 31:17.543
Hey!

31:17.576 --> 31:18.677
We're locked in.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.112
She locked us in.

31:20.146 --> 31:22.214
Hey! Hey!
Help!

31:22.248 --> 31:24.550
GREGORIO:
Help!

31:35.394 --> 31:37.096
Sebastian

31:37.129 --> 31:39.198
All right, we're at
Barthelemy's crypt, King.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.000
Can't reach them on the cell,
and no sign of them anywhere.

31:41.033 --> 31:42.668
No sign of Michelle, either.

31:42.701 --> 31:45.071
Well, if Michelle's got the
map, she's long gone by now.

31:45.104 --> 31:47.673
Probably headed to wherever
the other suspects are.

31:47.706 --> 31:49.175
Hey, you still got
their cell GPS?

31:49.208 --> 31:51.043
Yeah, and I'm gonna
follow them now.

31:51.077 --> 31:54.546
Just make sure you find
Gregorio and Sebastian.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.048
I wish we had
the puzzle book.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.117
At least we'd know
where they went next.

31:58.150 --> 32:02.054
Okay, go clockwise, check every
crypt from Lafitte's time.

32:02.088 --> 32:03.689
If they haven't left
the cemetery,

32:03.722 --> 32:05.091
they're there somewhere.

32:05.124 --> 32:06.525
LASALLE:
All right, we're on it, King.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.660
Sebastian! Gregorio!

32:08.694 --> 32:10.529
Your agents got
a hell of a lot of information

32:10.562 --> 32:12.031
from cloning their phones.

32:12.064 --> 32:14.733
Including caller I.D.,
which made us realize

32:14.766 --> 32:17.703
Michelle changed her last name,
and that's why we missed her.

32:17.736 --> 32:20.706
Damn it, still no signal.

32:20.739 --> 32:22.074
Hey, why don't you use
your light to help us

32:22.108 --> 32:23.209
get out of here?

32:23.242 --> 32:24.710
You know,
we wouldn't even

32:24.743 --> 32:27.046
be in this situation if you
didn't let her play you.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.247
Play me?

32:28.280 --> 32:29.681
Please, she's not even my type.

32:29.715 --> 32:31.383
Oh, now she's not your type.
Right.

32:31.417 --> 32:32.484
She's not.

32:32.518 --> 32:33.685
We already tried
ramming the door.

32:33.719 --> 32:35.387
That was useless.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.623
Walls are so thick,
no one's gonna hear us.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.558
Okay, so what are we gonna do?

32:39.591 --> 32:41.193
We're not gonna panic.
All right.

32:41.227 --> 32:42.628
We'll use up whatever
oxygen is left in here.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.130
Okay.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.498
Wait, i

32:46.532 --> 32:48.400
Well, nearly. People in here
don't typically need

32:48.434 --> 32:49.668
to breathe anymore.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.344
Michelle Harrison.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.212
Her brother was killed

33:00.246 --> 33:03.049
diving for sunken treasure
off the coast of Gibraltar.

33:03.082 --> 33:06.018
Spain confiscated the gold, and
said it was government property.

33:06.052 --> 33:07.219
And if she was looking

33:07.253 --> 33:09.221
for the Napoleon Fleur,

33:09.255 --> 33:11.657
working at the Historian Society
would've been the best place

33:11.690 --> 33:14.360
to figure out how to find it.

33:14.393 --> 33:15.561
Elaine trusted her.

33:15.594 --> 33:16.762
I'm gonna get her.

33:16.795 --> 33:18.164
I promise.

33:18.197 --> 33:20.199
I'm going with you.
Not this time.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.601
There are at least
three of them, if not more,

33:22.634 --> 33:24.103
and they're killers.

33:24.136 --> 33:25.337
You need backup.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.039
I'm sorry, Tom.

33:27.073 --> 33:28.107
I just can't do it.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.641
Damn it!

33:29.675 --> 33:32.411
Those bastards killed
my daughter.

33:34.746 --> 33:37.216
You have to let me help you.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.385
Please.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.490
SONJA:
Sebastian

33:44.523 --> 33:48.160
Are you sure Sebastian's last
text was from a crypt, King?

33:48.194 --> 33:49.728
'Cause we haven't found
them yet, and we're
running out of options.

33:49.761 --> 33:51.830
PRIDE:
I'm sure because Michelle lied

33:51.863 --> 33:53.732
about the translation.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.367
It had nothing
to do with crypts.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.169
Keep looking.
LASALLE: You got it.

33:59.205 --> 34:00.806
I can't breathe.

34:00.839 --> 34:03.041
There's got to be a way.

34:08.780 --> 34:09.581
Are you out of your mind?
Those bullets

34:09.615 --> 34:11.117
will ricochet
all over the place.

34:11.150 --> 34:13.185
Bullets aren't for shooting.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.788
Some candles over there.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.624
Come here.

34:18.657 --> 34:20.192
Help me find a
match, all right?

34:20.226 --> 34:21.827
Okay.

34:21.860 --> 34:24.230
I found one.

34:24.263 --> 34:26.198
All right,
great. Listen.

34:26.232 --> 34:27.699
We're gonna light a fire.

34:27.733 --> 34:28.800
All right? And we're gonna hope

34:28.834 --> 34:29.868
that whatever smoke there is,

34:29.901 --> 34:31.670
it seeps through the cracks.
All right.

34:31.703 --> 34:34.740
Otherwise,
we're gonna suffocate.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.208
We're already suffocating.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.743
You're not wrong.

34:42.881 --> 34:44.883
TOM:
According to the GPS,

34:44.916 --> 34:46.285
they're stopping by Lake Borgne.

34:46.318 --> 34:47.753
PRIDE:
Makes sense, especially since

34:47.786 --> 34:49.788
the last clue references

34:49.821 --> 34:52.391
the "chief of liars,"
Chef Menteur.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.160
Chef Menteur,
the first French fort

34:54.193 --> 34:55.894
built before
the Louisiana Purchase.

34:55.927 --> 35:00.232
Which was razed and rebuilt
as Fort Macomb.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.100
The Fleur-de-Lis is there.

35:03.869 --> 35:05.337
Help!
Help!

35:06.805 --> 35:08.574
Look, let's-let's start over.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.242
LASALLE:
Percy.

35:10.276 --> 35:11.543
Look.

35:13.845 --> 35:15.514
Help!

35:19.318 --> 35:20.619
Oh, my God.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.754
Thank you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.890
Relax. Chris,
go get them some water.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.758
I got it.
Oh, man, that was close.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.894
Michelle, she...
Yeah, we know, we know.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.862
Pride's following
the suspects. Her, too.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.898
We got to go.
He might need us.

35:32.931 --> 35:35.601
And anyway, she played us,
so that means we owe her.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.636
Yeah, big-time.
Let's go.

35:49.215 --> 35:52.184
All right, listen to me.

35:52.218 --> 35:54.386
NOPD's on the way.

35:54.420 --> 35:55.954
I want you to fill them in
when they get here.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.923
Let them know
that I'm by myself.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.925
I'm going with you.
No. You're not, Tom.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.294
Listen, I appreciate
all you've done,

36:02.328 --> 36:05.197
and I know all too well
what they've done to you,

36:05.231 --> 36:06.932
but you're
a civilian.

36:06.965 --> 36:09.235
And that means, this time,
you need to stay put.

36:10.569 --> 36:12.170
You understand?

36:13.639 --> 36:15.574
Hey.

36:15.607 --> 36:16.608
Keys to the lockbox.

36:16.642 --> 36:18.176
Just in case.

36:35.894 --> 36:38.196
*

37:04.423 --> 37:05.724
Freeze, Michelle.

37:05.757 --> 37:08.327
Turn around slow.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.996
Easy.

37:13.699 --> 37:15.701
Where's Hendricks, and Walton?

37:15.734 --> 37:19.738
Actually, they've got
Elaine's father.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.773
Right behind you.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.937
You're not stalling, are you?

37:51.970 --> 37:54.873
I'm digging as fast as I can.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.543
You sure this is the right spot?
Banking on it.

37:57.576 --> 37:58.777
I went through a lot
to get this map.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.045
Including killing my daughter.

38:00.078 --> 38:01.447
She didn't have to die.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.315
All I wanted was the coordinates
to the book.

38:03.349 --> 38:04.816
Which she found, not you.
I have been looking

38:04.850 --> 38:07.052
for the Napoleon Fleur
for years; it's mine.

38:07.085 --> 38:09.388
Not gonna get screwed over
like my brother was.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.395
Step away.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.397
Now. Go. Out, now.

38:19.465 --> 38:20.566
Get out. Get out, now.

38:32.611 --> 38:33.445
Get the gun!

38:36.415 --> 38:37.349
SEBASTIAN:
NCIS!

38:37.383 --> 38:39.351
Freeze!

38:40.118 --> 38:40.952
Tom, don't.

38:40.986 --> 38:43.355
No, please.
Don't. You got a chance

38:43.389 --> 38:44.490
to finish what
your daughter started.

38:44.523 --> 38:46.425
What you
both started.

38:47.426 --> 38:48.594
Find the Fleur,

38:48.627 --> 38:51.397
make her sacrifice
mean something.

38:51.430 --> 38:52.498
I know
you're hurting.

38:52.531 --> 38:53.765
Tom, I know.

38:53.799 --> 38:56.568
I know you want to get even
for what they did.

38:56.602 --> 38:57.869
MICHELLE:
No, please.

38:57.903 --> 38:59.070
But it's not gonna

38:59.104 --> 39:02.007
bring Elaine back.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.109
It's not gonna
get you closer to her.

39:09.415 --> 39:10.115
No!

39:21.092 --> 39:23.462
Okay.

39:37.443 --> 39:39.711
Decide what you want
to do with it yet?

39:39.745 --> 39:43.682
Yeah. I think I'm gonna do what
Elaine would've done with it.

39:44.850 --> 39:47.118
Give it back
to its rightful owner.

39:47.152 --> 39:48.954
Donate it to the city.

39:52.624 --> 39:54.593
I think she'd like that.

39:54.626 --> 39:56.161
Yeah, me, too.

39:56.194 --> 39:58.464
Although-- hear me out--

39:58.497 --> 40:01.633
what if, before that,
we each take it home for a day,

40:01.667 --> 40:03.735
like they do
with the Stanley Cup.
I like that.

40:03.769 --> 40:05.471
What is the Stanley Cup?

40:05.504 --> 40:06.938
You know, Percy...

40:06.972 --> 40:08.974
you got to get out more.

40:09.007 --> 40:10.075
Tell me about it.

40:12.678 --> 40:16.114
We might want to get you
an escort to the mayor's office.

40:16.147 --> 40:17.115
Chris, Sebastian?

40:17.148 --> 40:18.116
Yeah.
We're on it, King.

40:18.149 --> 40:20.151
Hey.
Percy.

40:20.185 --> 40:23.221
Yeah?
Hey, you want to grab a bite
afterwards, catch up?

40:23.254 --> 40:27.926
Oh. Um, actually, Gregorio and I
already made plans.

40:27.959 --> 40:30.462
But... we could rain check.

40:30.496 --> 40:32.464
Course.

40:32.498 --> 40:33.499
Cool.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.836
I'm starving,
for what it's worth.

40:37.869 --> 40:40.138
Let's do it.
All right.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.147
Thanks.

40:50.816 --> 40:52.984
For everything.

41:24.750 --> 41:25.884
Hello?

41:25.917 --> 41:27.553
Hey, Laurel, it's Dad.

41:27.586 --> 41:28.987
Hey, Daddy, what's up?

41:29.020 --> 41:30.522
Nah, nothing,
I just thought I'd call you,

41:30.556 --> 41:34.593
see... see what you're doing.
