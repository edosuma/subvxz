01:00.880 --> 01:02.000
[Vivi] Hurry up.

01:22.760 --> 01:25.160
[man] Whoa!
What the fuck you think you're doing?

01:26.200 --> 01:27.040
Whoa.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.400
So you tag.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.040
What's this bullshit?

01:33.920 --> 01:35.800
Oh, you're too good to answer?

01:37.080 --> 01:39.160
Silent treatment, huh? Come here.
Let me show you how this works.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.640
Let me go! Hey,
get your hands off me, you fucking pig.

01:41.720 --> 01:42.800
You don't like that?

01:43.720 --> 01:46.280
Graffiti's our game, little girls.
You wanna act tough?

01:46.880 --> 01:49.240
I'm gonna treat you like tough guys.
I don't give a shit about your pussies.

01:49.840 --> 01:50.720
Get outta here.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.160
Come on.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.360
I said get the fuck outta here.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.920
-Hey, black boy.
-You got a problem?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.840
These fuckers again.
Come here. Come here, you Nazis.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.520
-Hey, dirty negro.
-What's up, Jungle Boy?

02:02.600 --> 02:03.880
What you want? Come on!

02:03.960 --> 02:05.680
-You got a fucking problem?
-You got something to say?

02:07.880 --> 02:09.600
-[man 1] Come on! Come on!
-[man 2] You wanna fight? Come on.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.640
What've you got?

[hip hop music playing on headphones]

03:07.440 --> 03:09.080
-[Patou] You good, honey?
-Yeah.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.160
Doing homework?

03:11.240 --> 03:12.360
Yeah, I'm all done.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.320
-You switched out the picture.
-Hmm?

03:20.080 --> 03:22.200
-The photo of your dad.
-Yeah.

03:22.760 --> 03:23.840
Why?

03:23.920 --> 03:25.120
What did you do with it?

03:25.680 --> 03:26.960
Threw it out.

03:28.000 --> 03:28.840
But why?

03:28.920 --> 03:31.000
I don't know.
I was just sick of seeing his face.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.120
Okay.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.240
You're right.
You two look good in that shot.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.840
Could you please lend me 50 francs, Mom?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.000
For what?

03:41.080 --> 03:42.280
To buy a bra.

03:42.960 --> 03:46.240
You don't wanna go together on Saturday,
so we can get you some other things?

03:46.320 --> 03:49.320
-No, I wanna go on my own.
-Okay.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.160
[Didier] Ba-ba-ba.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.680
That's great.
We're gonna go to <i>Grange-aux-Belles</i>.

04:34.760 --> 04:37.360
You'll see some of the guys
are super fast on the ground, man.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.200
And we'll show them a thing or two,

04:39.280 --> 04:40.600
just like this.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.000
We're gonna show them how to…

04:45.160 --> 04:47.160
…slide. Just like that.

04:48.040 --> 04:48.880
Boom.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.160
-Some waves.
-Show them what?

04:51.240 --> 04:52.840
-Show them that?
-Yeah.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.760
Go on. What are you gonna teach me?

04:57.080 --> 04:58.640
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

05:00.840 --> 05:01.760
Yeah.

05:01.840 --> 05:02.960
-Whoa!
-That one's getting much better, huh?

05:03.040 --> 05:05.000
Yeah,
except I can't get back up half the time.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.040
Don't worry about it.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.760
You might get it in another year, eh?

05:09.040 --> 05:10.520
[laughs]

05:10.600 --> 05:11.960
Ah, now he's ready.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.480
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

05:13.560 --> 05:16.480
Brunette! Brunette! Let's go! Bruno!

05:16.560 --> 05:20.160
Let's go! Bruno! That's it, Bruno.
Yeah, Bruno!

05:20.240 --> 05:21.400
Yes! Yes!

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Yeah, oh, there it is.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.840
Yes!

05:27.440 --> 05:29.480
That looked like it hurt, man.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.200
Check it out. Hey, look.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.840
Hey, windmill. Windmill.

05:34.920 --> 05:35.840
Bruno!

05:37.160 --> 05:38.200
It's starting. Come on!

05:39.400 --> 05:41.720
-Sorry, let's go.
-That was amazing!

[opening of H.I.P H.O.P]

05:52.480 --> 05:53.760
-Is it recording?
-Yeah.

05:53.840 --> 05:54.840
You sure?

05:54.920 --> 05:59.400
<i>Hello, my brothers and sisters,</i>
<i>I hope you're taking care of each other.</i>

05:59.480 --> 06:01.760
<i>Today, we're bringing you a dance move</i>

<i>that everyone in France</i>
<i>has been waiting for.</i>

06:04.040 --> 06:05.040
<i>You asked for it.</i>

06:05.120 --> 06:07.120
<i>Today we're gonna learn the spin.</i>

06:07.200 --> 06:09.280
-Never seen so many black people on TV.
<i>-Here are our guests.</i>

06:09.360 --> 06:12.440
<i>Let's give them a warm welcome.</i>
<i>Today, we have the PCBs with us.</i>

06:13.400 --> 06:14.600
<i>Okay, are you ready?</i>

06:14.680 --> 06:16.400
-<i>Here we go! The PCBs.</i>
-Who are those guys?

06:16.480 --> 06:18.440
The PCBs. New dance crew.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.920
That guy, Solo. He came out of Troca.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.080
Didier knows him.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.480
Hey, did you see that?
He crosses his supporting leg.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.120
Oh, the windmill.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.240
Fuck, he made it.

06:41.320 --> 06:43.880
Oh, yeah?
So when are gonna get the windmill?

06:45.200 --> 06:46.480
[Didier chuckles]

06:46.560 --> 06:47.680
I'm working on it. Don't worry.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.360
Besides spinning on your backs
like a couple of clowns,

06:50.440 --> 06:51.480
what're your plans?

06:52.520 --> 06:53.680
I mean your real plans.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.160
I don't know, but I love it.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.720
You like to lift weights all weekend.
What's the point of that?

07:01.760 --> 07:04.400
Oh, I lift plywood all week
to pay for your lifestyle.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.320
So what's your real job gonna be? Huh?

07:07.880 --> 07:09.800
A break-dancer?

07:09.880 --> 07:11.120
I'm home!

07:12.400 --> 07:13.480
What are you doing?

07:14.080 --> 07:16.520
-We're watching breakdancing.
-Who moved the table?

07:17.720 --> 07:18.840
It stinks in here.

07:20.720 --> 07:21.720
Let's air it out a bit, huh?

07:21.800 --> 07:23.520
You can smoke in the kitchen.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.760
-Come on, let's bounce.
-Gilles.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.720
-What?
-Coming through, please. Just move over.

07:28.640 --> 07:29.480
Sorry.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.360
-Don't come home late.
-Where's you running off to?

07:32.440 --> 07:34.000
Stop it. You're just a jerk. Jeez.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.720
Give me a second, I'll be right there.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.360
So, Didier, how's school going for you?

07:39.880 --> 07:41.000
It's fine.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.640
I saw you in an R5 the other day.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.880
It's my dad's car.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.680
Oh, really? Your dad has an R5 now?

07:50.760 --> 07:53.480
I'm warning you, be very careful, Didier.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.520
Don't get my son into any of your shit.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.080
Do you understand me?

08:01.080 --> 08:02.280
All right.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.360
-Where are you going?
-Out.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.600
Where's out?

08:05.680 --> 08:06.760
Just out. Come on.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.000
You couldn't help me out there?

08:14.080 --> 08:17.240
Dead weight.
Can you believe it?

08:18.160 --> 08:19.960
I'm sure she didn't mean it.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.600
Frankly, I'm not sure what hurts me more,

08:22.680 --> 08:24.600
her kicking me out
or her calling me dead weight.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.400
But you still have
your 16-track recorder, don't you?

08:30.280 --> 08:32.320
She broke my heart
when she said that, you know.

08:33.400 --> 08:34.960
I wasn't even up yet.

08:35.680 --> 08:38.240
I opened my eyes, and there she was,

08:38.320 --> 08:41.600
already dressed, standing by the armoire,
putting on her make up for work.

08:41.680 --> 08:44.640
She turned towards me,
looked me up and down,

08:44.720 --> 08:46.560
and right at the moment she said to me,

08:47.240 --> 08:49.360
"I'm wasting my time with you,
you're dead weight."

08:50.560 --> 08:52.680
Where is it? We have to get it back.

08:55.040 --> 08:58.000
-I lost the will to live.
-But with your 16-track,

08:58.080 --> 08:59.720
I'll help you get back on your feet, huh?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.960
I'm gonna make a hell of an album.
And you're gonna produce it.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.800
Yeah, so now I'm not sure
if I should be taking one huge hit of acid

09:06.880 --> 09:08.400
or many small hits of acid.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.920
No, that isn't the answer.
Hey, why don't we go get it?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.240
Come on. Let's go get it.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.400
It's too complicated.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.680
We're gonna make the best fucking album.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.600
We'll go down in history.
Don't you wanna go down in history?

09:20.320 --> 09:22.720
No, I'd rather go down to Bordeaux.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.200
My grandparents have a farm over there.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.760
They have stuff for me to fix.
It'll keep me distracted.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.600
It's calm over there.
Really nice and calm.

09:31.680 --> 09:34.280
Yeah, well, that's exactly what we need.
Somewhere calm, away from the city.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.720
You, me, and your 16-track.
It'll be amazing.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.520
So, where's your ex staying right now?

09:38.600 --> 09:41.360
I'll go pick it up
and then we'll be off to the country.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.480
No, it's too complicated.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.120
I owe her six months' rent.

09:47.760 --> 09:48.960
My accounts are suspended.

09:52.360 --> 09:56.040
There are collection agents who've been
threatening to show up at the apartment.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.320
If they haven't already, so that's a…

09:58.400 --> 10:00.400
Collection agents? Are you sure?

10:00.480 --> 10:01.320
Yeah.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.760
-You think you can let them in?
-Fifteen francs.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.280
So?

10:11.360 --> 10:13.520
No, there's no way to get around him.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.680
It's 15 francs to get in.

10:14.760 --> 10:17.600
-Fifteen francs?
-I'm flat broke. How much you got?

10:17.680 --> 10:18.920
Jeez, Didier, you're always broke, man.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.520
-Well, uh…
-You're coming with me,

10:20.600 --> 10:21.720
you filthy street walker!

10:22.800 --> 10:23.800
-Let me go!
-What?

10:24.400 --> 10:27.240
What did you just say to me,
you filthy little whore?

10:27.320 --> 10:28.600
Hey, let go of her.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.560
If I ever see you here again,
I will kill you. Understand me?

10:34.720 --> 10:36.880
Yeah, to hell with all of you.
She's my daughter.

10:36.960 --> 10:40.680
-We can see that!
-Hurry up! Come on!

10:41.280 --> 10:42.600
Hey, it's the PCBs.

10:42.680 --> 10:45.120
Hey, aren't you those television stars?

10:45.200 --> 10:46.680
It's Mr. Solo himself.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.800
Morville.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.280
So? Come on, spill it.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.880
-Was your mommy proud of you?
-Yeah.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.640
And did yours give you money
to get in this time? Huh?

10:56.720 --> 10:58.640
When we finally get in,
we're gonna beat you all.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.440
Oh, really? You think you can take us?

11:00.520 --> 11:02.000
Tell you what, we're gonna go inside now.

11:02.080 --> 11:03.520
There's still a long line
waiting for you guys.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.760
Yeah, well, nothing's as long as my dick.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.400
Hey, do you think you can
get me and my friends in too?

11:09.480 --> 11:11.360
So we can beat you faster, huh?

11:12.640 --> 11:14.200
-Huh?
-Yeah, come on.

11:14.280 --> 11:15.800
-Oh, yeah? Come on.
-Hey!

11:15.880 --> 11:17.480
-Didier. Didier. Hey, Didier.
-Yes.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.240
-What's up?
-What's up, man?

11:21.320 --> 11:23.240
-I don't think we should go in.
-But he got us through the door, man.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.080
I got three excited superfans
who want to come in too.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.920
-No, no, come on.
-Can we make something happen?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.080
Yeah, okay, but just this once.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.800
Hang on, Didier,
let's talk for a second.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.560
-Come on.
-Yeah, let's just talk for a second.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.800
-Talk about what? We're getting--
-What are you guys doing?

11:33.880 --> 11:35.280
-Come on.
-Are you coming or not?

11:35.360 --> 11:37.440
-What's your problem? What is it?
-What did you say?

11:38.040 --> 11:40.120
Uh, he didn't mean that.
I'm very sorry. He meant--

11:40.200 --> 11:43.040
You didn't mean what you said.
He didn't mean that, sir. Sorry.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.080
-I have no idea what his problem is.
-You're not getting in. Get lost.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.760
-Wait.
-You got it?

11:47.280 --> 11:48.880
I never wanna see your face again.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.840
Hey, man. What is your problem, huh? Huh?

11:53.440 --> 11:55.920
I just got us in there for free
and now you've just blown it for us.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.240
No, I haven't blown anything.
You don't get it.

11:58.320 --> 11:59.760
I'm not interested
in getting my ass kicked

11:59.840 --> 12:01.320
by guys who've been doing it for longer.

12:01.400 --> 12:04.200
So, we'll get better and we'll come back
and destroy them. Okay?

12:10.120 --> 12:11.800
[knock on door]

12:14.680 --> 12:15.880
Hallo there, miss.

12:16.880 --> 12:18.880
Mr. Perolini, Esquire. Court bailiff.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.040
What do you want?

12:20.120 --> 12:21.600
I don't know if you're aware,

12:21.680 --> 12:24.960
but Mr. Eskenazi
is in grave financial difficulty.

12:25.040 --> 12:25.920
Oh, yeah, I'm aware.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.480
Several recovery attempts
have been made since last year

12:28.560 --> 12:30.120
and as a representative of the state,

12:30.200 --> 12:32.200
-I must now go seize his belongings--
-Don't talk to me about that asshole.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.720
-If you could just--
-I just don't wanna hear

12:33.800 --> 12:36.520
-another word about him. You got it?
-Miss, please listen.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.520
-Enough!
-Miss, please.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.480
If you stop us from seizing his things,

12:39.560 --> 12:41.440
there's a chance
you could possibly be sued

12:41.520 --> 12:43.240
for the obstruction of financial justice.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.120
Oh, yeah, let me see your paper.

12:46.200 --> 12:50.040
I was tasked with collecting
his belongings and it must happen today.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.560
I'm sorry, but we really must proceed.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.360
Are you for real?

12:58.440 --> 13:00.280
You wanna get rid of his shit for me?

13:00.360 --> 13:01.640
Be my guest.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.280
Knock yourselves out.
Just come right in. Come in.

13:05.600 --> 13:06.640
Gentlemen.

13:07.800 --> 13:08.640
Here.

13:09.600 --> 13:10.800
This is his.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.720
All the hi-fi equipment.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.760
-You mean all the hi-fi is his?
-Everything is his.

13:14.840 --> 13:17.800
The instruments, all of it. Take it all.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.400

13:29.720 --> 13:30.880
A ukulele.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.560
And a bunch of random cables.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.040
What is that?

13:39.120 --> 13:40.400
It's my tag.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.760
Your what?

13:41.840 --> 13:43.760
It's a nickname. It's like my signature.

13:43.840 --> 13:44.800
What are you going to sign?

13:45.400 --> 13:47.600
Oh, I don't know. Walls.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.120
What? Walls? But what for?

13:50.800 --> 13:52.920
I don't know. It's just beautiful.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
It's art.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.080
You like art, right?

13:56.680 --> 13:58.720
-What walls will you put that on?
-I don't know.

13:59.320 --> 14:00.240
Around here?

14:00.960 --> 14:03.360
You won't put my name on the walls
of this neighborhood, do you hear?

14:03.960 --> 14:04.840
Did you bump your head?

14:04.920 --> 14:06.480
Granny, it's not your name, it's mine.

14:06.560 --> 14:07.880
Same thing.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.480
Everybody knows who Vivi is.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.600
No way. No.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.360
-You will not do that around here.
-Find me another tag then.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.880
-Here. For you bra.
-Thanks.

14:32.160 --> 14:34.440
-You sure it's here?
-I think so.

14:36.480 --> 14:37.320
Ah.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.400
Go on, ring it.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.120
[anxious sigh]

14:53.240 --> 14:54.240
You all right?

14:54.320 --> 14:56.160
-Goodbye.
-Bye, thank you.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.120
Who's next?

15:06.120 --> 15:07.000
Hang on.

15:18.880 --> 15:21.920
-Let me figure out what brings you here.
-Yeah.

15:22.880 --> 15:23.880
I'm looking for my dad.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.800
I wanna know if he's still alive.
If he's still in Paris.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.080
I understand, my dear.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.720
But I'm not gonna find your father
with a crystal ball.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.360
I'm sorry, I gave you everything I have.

15:38.440 --> 15:40.120
It isn't the money.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.080
My specialty is in professional matters,
star-crossed lovers.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.480
I don't specialize
in finding missing people.

15:50.800 --> 15:51.920
What's your name?

15:54.400 --> 15:55.280
Sullé

15:57.600 --> 15:59.560
But his is different.
It's written on the back.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.240
-Hallo. How are you, Daniel?
-Hallo.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.320
Did you get dressed up for me?

17:36.120 --> 17:37.120
You didn't have to.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.160
Here, honey.

17:42.240 --> 17:43.200
Thanks.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.600
So what's your important news?

17:47.120 --> 17:48.640
I'm heading to Bordeaux.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.080
I'm going with a friend
to record an album.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.280
The first French hip-hop album.

17:55.800 --> 17:56.920
Cool for you.

17:59.440 --> 18:02.000
But I thought I could give you
the keys to my apartment,

18:02.080 --> 18:03.200
if you like?

18:03.280 --> 18:05.440
It would work out well for me
and you'd have a place to stay.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.160
You wanna give me your keys?

18:08.520 --> 18:10.360
I thought you weren't
giving them out anymore?

18:10.960 --> 18:12.760
You're not afraid I'm gonna rob you?

18:13.440 --> 18:14.440
Should I be?

18:18.360 --> 18:19.840
I don't know.

-Shows?

he just wanted us to dance.

a pair of balls.

27:12.480 --> 27:14.000
I can't see his name.

27:24.920 --> 27:26.640

27:26.720 --> 27:27.800
I don't know.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.440
I would recognize him, no?

27:30.520 --> 27:31.520
I don't know.

["Paname City Rappin'" by Dee Nasty

32:08.360 --> 32:10.280
I see you put your phone number on there.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.480
Yeah. That way people can get in touch,

32:12.560 --> 32:14.800
-for projects.
-Oh, that's smart.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.520
The first French rap album.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.160
Oh, yeah, that's great.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.600
So, you'll buy them?

32:19.680 --> 32:21.880
Uh, listen, Daniel, uh…

32:22.720 --> 32:24.760
I can probably take a few samples,

32:24.840 --> 32:27.120
but, you know, I can't take them all.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.520
-Wait, what do you mean?
-Look, Daniel, you don't get it.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.040
French rap will never be a thing.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.680
Take that hip-hop TV show.

32:32.760 --> 32:35.280
-It was popular, but it was a fad.
-Seriously?

32:35.360 --> 32:38.120
JB, come on, I've been to four different
record shops already.

32:38.200 --> 32:41.000
You're kidding me, right?
Obviously, record dealers won't take it,

32:41.080 --> 32:42.360
it'll never sell.

32:42.440 --> 32:44.680
And hip-hop customers are the worst.

32:44.760 --> 32:47.400
They hang around for hours
and they don't spend a cent.

32:47.480 --> 32:50.080
And as soon as you turn around,
they steal things. Huh?

32:50.720 --> 32:52.280
No, I can't promote this kind of stuff.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.280
Wait a second,
I think you're missing the point.

32:54.360 --> 32:57.720
I'm not sure that you were truly,
truly listening to the music.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.720
Really, just listen to it a little longer.

33:00.840 --> 33:01.800
Really listen.

-Look, I, uh…
-Listen.

Shit. This stuff, it's--
This stuff is fucking legendary.

33:11.240 --> 33:14.560
And you think this is passé, but no,
this is tomorrow. This is the future.

33:14.640 --> 33:15.800
-Look, maybe--
-Maybe?

33:15.880 --> 33:18.000
Well, then, maybe this record
should be all over the shop.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.120
It should be here, it should be there.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.280
It should be everywhere.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.160
Look, you're flipping right out.
That's normal.

33:22.240 --> 33:25.120
But it's because, in the history of music,
there's always been something new

33:25.200 --> 33:27.720
-that freaks everybody out.
-It's just not my clientele. Got it?

33:27.800 --> 33:29.800
-I don't want that.
-What do you mean, not your clientele?

33:29.880 --> 33:32.280
-You know what I'm talking about.
-No, explain it to me.

You sit here in your bullshit shop

but you're a piece of shit.
What do you play? Bagpipes? Accordion?

33:37.200 --> 33:38.560
-What do you even do?
-All right, listen. I'm not gonna stand…

the other track, please.

40:12.760 --> 40:14.600
I promise I'm being careful.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.240
You just need to make sure
the groove is shaped down.

40:16.920 --> 40:17.880
I know.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.680
It keeps me up at night.
I can't stop thinking about it.

40:20.760 --> 40:21.920
I don't want the track to be on there.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.600
Do you wanna keep a box, just in case?

40:29.680 --> 40:31.240
Oh, no, no, please. Scratch them all.

40:33.720 --> 40:34.680
I'm taking a break.

40:44.280 --> 40:45.640
I loved that track. It's really unique.

40:45.720 --> 40:47.920
Oh, no, there's no flow.
Did you listen to it or what?

40:48.000 --> 40:50.520
It's already outdated now.
It's so lame, I can't believe it.

40:50.600 --> 40:52.080
Yeah, but what if,

40:52.160 --> 40:55.640
later on, people think
it's one of the best tracks on the album?

40:55.720 --> 40:58.200
Well, for that to happen, we'd have to
start selling the damn things.

40:58.280 --> 41:00.280
Hey, stop that.
You're going to sell your album.

41:00.360 --> 41:03.680
You know, all the great prophets,
all the geniuses of the world,

41:03.760 --> 41:06.520
well, they all started preaching
in the desert. This is normal.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.360
Nobody understood these guys.
They all died alone, misunderstood,

41:09.440 --> 41:12.160

their whole lives. No one saw them.

41:12.240 --> 41:14.360

They were the lowest of the low.

41:14.440 --> 41:16.520
And then later, years later,
sometimes even centuries later,

41:16.600 --> 41:18.800
they said, oh, okay. Well, okay, genius.

41:18.880 --> 41:21.800
This is normal. People are never ready.
They are never ready for real talent.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.840
Okay, well, I'm not so sure I wanna
die alone in a pile of my own shit.

41:24.920 --> 41:27.760
No, that's not what I'm saying.
That's not what I mean. It's just--

41:29.680 --> 41:32.240
I'm saying
you've got to have a bit of faith.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.080
Have some faith, Dan.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.160
You're going to make it out of this.

41:38.040 --> 41:40.840
All right, enough with the faith shit,
you're freaking me out.

41:44.680 --> 41:45.880
Do you want me to stay?

41:49.520 --> 41:52.800
-Do you wanna stay?
-Well, yeah, I mean…

41:54.720 --> 41:57.560
Should I move in here
to maybe live together?

41:57.640 --> 41:59.600
Well, yeah, but do you want to?

42:00.120 --> 42:02.920
Well, yeah, sure I want to
because I'm the one offering.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.880
You sure you wouldn't mind?

42:05.480 --> 42:07.320
-Really? That's your answer?
-What do you mean?

42:07.400 --> 42:09.760
Well, I don't know, Daniel,
I'm not offering to run errands for you?

42:09.840 --> 42:12.440
-No, I know you're not.
-You sure? It doesn't seem like you do.

42:12.520 --> 42:13.960
I'm not offering
to hold your dick while you piss.

42:14.040 --> 42:15.920
I'm not offering
to spoon-feed you soup forever.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.200
-No, I get it, I understand.
-No, I actually don't think that you do.

42:18.280 --> 42:19.720
That wasn't what I meant to say.

42:19.800 --> 42:20.760
-I'm sorry.
-What are you sorry for?

42:20.840 --> 42:22.400
-I was just saying…
-You were just what?

42:22.480 --> 42:24.400
-Sorry.
-Well, no. Don't be sorry. Don't be.

42:24.480 --> 42:26.240
-I'm sorry.
-No, just stop saying "sorry".

42:26.840 --> 42:29.600
-What should I do?
-Well, are you happy or not?

42:30.280 --> 42:33.680
-Well, sure.
-Well, then, smile.

44:02.200 --> 44:03.800
V, as in, you're fucking vile.

44:05.680 --> 44:06.840
You got better.

My name is Mad.

Where have you been sneaking around?

45:04.080 --> 45:05.960
What's with the radio? Did you steal it?

45:06.040 --> 45:08.560
