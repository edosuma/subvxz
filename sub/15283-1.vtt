00:00.130 --> 00:01.790
Previously on criminal minds...

00:01.800 --> 00:03.320
- where are we headed?
- new york.

00:03.330 --> 00:04.120
What do we know?

00:04.130 --> 00:05.450
All the killings are mid-day.

00:05.460 --> 00:07.340
Single gunshot to the head with a .22

00:07.350 --> 00:09.860
Surveillance cameras have
captured video of 3 of the murders.

00:09.880 --> 00:10.720
They're all the same.

00:10.730 --> 00:12.500
He wears a hood and keeps his head down.

00:12.510 --> 00:14.290
Kate joyner heads up the
new york field office.

00:14.300 --> 00:17.460
She's running point on the case along
with detectives brustin and cooper.

00:17.470 --> 00:18.870
From the placement of that camera,

00:18.880 --> 00:20.860
Odds are the only view they're
gonna get is the back of his head.

00:20.870 --> 00:23.690
Let's not be too quick to
decide what we do or don't have.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.660
You mind telling me why i'm
catching attitude from her?

00:25.680 --> 00:28.760
Fbi brass has made it clear to her that
if she doesn't bring this case home,

00:28.770 --> 00:30.180
She's gonna be reassigned.

00:30.190 --> 00:33.460
And you are at the top of
the list to replace her.

00:33.470 --> 00:34.250
Profile me.

00:34.260 --> 00:35.490
You don't wear a ring.

00:35.500 --> 00:36.860
And you were quick to flirt with me.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.680
So you're happy to let
people think you are a player.

00:39.700 --> 00:43.170
But you love your wife, and you
would never actually cheat on her.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.110
Get out of the way!

00:50.400 --> 00:51.220
Garcia!

00:51.230 --> 00:54.160
We've got an officer down,
16th west of union square.

00:54.180 --> 00:57.510
We think we might have a serious
problem. We have multiple unsubs.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.110
They're disciplined, they're
using countersurveillance,

01:00.120 --> 01:02.680
They know the fbi movements,
there's a hierarchy.

01:02.690 --> 01:04.730
What does that usually equal?

01:04.739 --> 01:05.590
Terrorism.

01:05.600 --> 01:09.530
They're ramping up to something, and they
want us to know that they're watching us.

01:09.550 --> 01:13.270
Creating panic ensures that they're see the
most urgent response time short of a bombing.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.320
We need to hit the ground running.

Hey, you ok?

02:27.180 --> 02:29.520
- sir, are you o--
- what's your name?

02:29.530 --> 02:30.520
What?

02:30.530 --> 02:33.680
- what's your name?
- sam.

02:33.690 --> 02:34.730
Call 911.

02:34.740 --> 02:35.760
Yeah, yeah, i did.

02:35.770 --> 02:37.880
Call 911, tell them
there's been an explosion.

02:37.890 --> 02:40.420
Sir, are you ok?

02:42.210 --> 02:44.840
You a cop?

02:48.760 --> 02:51.960
Listen, kate. Don't
worry. We'll get 'em.

02:52.890 --> 02:54.820
I know.

03:02.490 --> 03:04.890
Call 911. Tell them...

03:05.280 --> 03:07.890
That a federal agent...

03:07.900 --> 03:10.230
- ok, so you want
me to say-- - kate!

03:11.230 --> 03:11.990
Kate!

03:12.000 --> 03:15.920
- 911, this is the guy that called about the explosion.
- kate!

03:19.860 --> 03:22.980
Kate! Kate?

03:29.180 --> 03:33.840
Kate?

03:36.370 --> 03:39.640
My purse! I can't find my purse.

03:40.050 --> 03:42.550
- don't move.
- aaron, my purse.

03:43.450 --> 03:45.250
I don't think you had one.

03:45.260 --> 03:46.950
I must have dropped it.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.880
Kate, kate, kate, stop trying to move.

03:51.270 --> 03:56.520
Aaron. Aaron? -what happened to you?

03:56.530 --> 03:57.950
- what happened?
- i don't know.

03:57.960 --> 04:01.000
I don't know, a bomb. An
i.e.d. I think it was an i.e.d.

04:01.010 --> 04:03.610
I.e.d.? I have to get up.

04:03.620 --> 04:07.340
No, no, no, no. Lie down. Lie
still. You need to lie still.

04:07.350 --> 04:10.080
- am i moving my legs?
- what?

04:15.570 --> 04:18.470
Am i moving my legs?

04:18.480 --> 04:21.750
- i may have to turn you and see where the blood is coming from.
- do it.

04:21.760 --> 04:25.440
Ok.it might hurt. Sorry.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.190
Here, i'm gonna have to see...

04:30.200 --> 04:32.310
- are you ok? - yeah.you
just need to, um--

04:32.320 --> 04:35.410
I'm gonna have to see if i can...

04:36.050 --> 04:41.130
Just pinch it off until they
get here. Sorry, i know it hurts.

04:41.500 --> 04:45.380
No... It doesn't hurt.

04:46.340 --> 04:47.330
It doesn't hurt at all.

04:47.340 --> 04:49.970
Kate, kate, we're gonna
get you out of here, ok?

04:49.980 --> 04:52.460
We're gonna get you out of here.

04:53.310 --> 04:56.880
They're coming, they're
coming. Officer down!

04:57.570 --> 05:00.840
Officer down! Here!

05:00.850 --> 05:03.170
Aaron.

05:04.430 --> 05:06.520
They're not coming.

05:07.590 --> 05:09.850
We told them not to, remember?

05:09.860 --> 05:10.790
Now, how does this work?

05:10.800 --> 05:12.440
The murders simulate a bombing.

05:12.450 --> 05:15.090
They station someone to watch
and gauge police response time.

05:15.100 --> 05:17.000
At which point they know when
to bring in a second bomb.

05:17.010 --> 05:19.260
The goal is always to take out
the first round of civilians,

05:19.270 --> 05:22.480
Followed by a second wave
of emergency responders.

05:25.880 --> 05:30.460
The first wave of
responders are targets.

Ernest hemingway.

06:20.560 --> 06:23.170
You can't let go, can you, hotch?

06:25.170 --> 06:26.990
Aaron...

06:27.000 --> 06:28.630
You don't have to stay.

06:28.650 --> 06:30.960
I'm not leaving.

06:33.190 --> 06:38.120
Officer down! We need
some help! We cannot move!

06:38.840 --> 06:40.560
They're not coming.

06:40.830 --> 06:45.140
Yes, your orders are
not to let anyone in

06:45.150 --> 06:48.210
Until the area is cleared.

06:48.220 --> 06:50.230
Oh, man.

06:51.290 --> 06:54.090
- but that's-- -
that's proper procedure.

07:01.090 --> 07:05.940
We're getting reports that an explosion has rocked
the neighborhood in the vicinity of the federal plaza.

07:05.950 --> 07:08.040
Authorities have closed
down the entire area

07:08.050 --> 07:10.850
And are not going to give
any information at this time.

07:10.860 --> 07:14.130
And with 8 suspicious incidences
in as little as 3 weeks,

07:14.160 --> 07:18.230
We have no room but to speculate whether
or not there will be more attacks.

07:18.250 --> 07:19.840
We have no word yet on any injuries,

07:19.850 --> 07:22.950
But with the explosion heard
as far away as prince street,

07:22.960 --> 07:25.300
An unconfirmed report
said it was a car bomb.

07:25.310 --> 07:26.750

as well as federal...

07:26.760 --> 07:29.520
David, i heard on the radio.
I tried the others, but--

07:29.530 --> 07:30.700
The cell phone system is crashing.

07:30.710 --> 07:32.450
- a car bomb. Did they say where?
- no.

07:32.460 --> 07:34.790
Can you recall every site
where the shootings occurred?

07:34.800 --> 07:37.730
Uh, hell's kitchen, murray
hill, lower east side, chinatown.

07:37.740 --> 07:41.280
All right, if our profile is correct and all
8 murders were tests to gauge response times,

07:41.290 --> 07:45.200
We're looking at 8 suicide bombers who are
about to hit every one of those locations.

07:45.210 --> 07:46.510
Call homeland security.

07:46.520 --> 07:48.680
Tell them to pour troops
into all of those sites.

07:48.690 --> 07:51.180
Actually, if we're correct,
there'll be 16 suicide bombers.

07:51.190 --> 07:51.830
16?

07:51.840 --> 07:55.100
Yeah, we predicted that they'll hit the
second wave of emergency responders also.

07:55.110 --> 07:57.340
Breaking news now. We are
just getting an update.

07:57.350 --> 08:00.530
The bomb is now reported
to have been inside an suv.

08:00.540 --> 08:04.790
A black suv parked just
blocks from 26 federal plaza.

08:04.810 --> 08:06.250
Now, it is un...

08:06.150 --> 08:08.660
{\a6}<i>CCTV COMMAND POST</i>

08:06.170 --> 08:08.560
Agent rossi? We heard there
was some kind of explosion.

08:08.570 --> 08:10.080
- we got this.
- where are you?

08:10.090 --> 08:12.300
I just walked into
the cctv command post.

08:12.310 --> 08:13.280
Can you see anything?

08:13.290 --> 08:15.120
I literally just walked
through the door, sir.

08:15.130 --> 08:17.720
We got on the news it
was an suv that exploded.

08:17.740 --> 08:21.080
A black suv within blocks
of the federal plaza.

08:21.090 --> 08:23.110
- oh, god.
- now, do you have eyes there?

08:23.120 --> 08:27.090
I, uh--yeah, yeah, i've got like 300
cameras right there. Give me a sec.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.610
I'm here with reid, but i
don't know where anyone else is.

08:29.620 --> 08:31.540
- and, garcia...
- yes, sir.

08:31.550 --> 08:34.330
- find them.
- ok.

08:34.340 --> 08:38.850
Lisa, i need every feed of every camera for 20
blocks concentrically out from the federal plaza.

08:38.860 --> 08:40.429
Get the best exposure
from every angle you can

08:40.440 --> 08:41.830
- and then back those feeds up.
- you got it.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.070
I'm gonna call the rest of my team.

08:55.510 --> 08:57.310
Yeah. I'm still here.

08:57.320 --> 08:58.740
Yes, you are. Thank god.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.930
I'm almost back at the federal
building. What the hell's going on?

09:00.940 --> 09:03.250
All right, we're going over the
closed circuit footage right now.

09:03.260 --> 09:04.490
Who else have you checked on?

09:04.500 --> 09:06.260
You're the first. Rossi
and reid called me.

09:06.270 --> 09:09.080
All right, well, keep me on the line
while you check on everyone else.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.280
Is everyone ok?

09:10.290 --> 09:12.320
I've spoken to rossi and
reid and morgan's on the line.

09:12.330 --> 09:13.350
Emily, where are you?

09:13.360 --> 09:17.560
I'm following detective brustin to one of
the nypd's critical incident command posts.

09:17.590 --> 09:19.670
One of them? Yeah, after
911 they decentralized.

09:19.680 --> 09:21.720
They had way too many eggs
in one basket on that day.

09:21.730 --> 09:23.220
Has anyone talked to jj?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.760
She was headed back to the hotel.

09:24.770 --> 09:27.350
- in an suv?
- i think so.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.690
Stay with me a minute.
I'll dial her mobile.

09:29.700 --> 09:34.090
This is agent jareau, communications
director for the fbi's behavioral--

09:34.100 --> 09:35.630
What was that? What happened?

09:35.640 --> 09:36.650
It went dead mid-message.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.820
Try here again. She's
probably back at--

09:38.830 --> 09:40.420
Emily?

09:41.840 --> 09:45.600
Derek. Derek?

09:47.240 --> 09:49.540
- i just lost all contact with my team.
- i found it.

09:49.770 --> 09:50.340
I've never not
been able to--

09:50.350 --> 09:51.470
- garcia.
- what?

09:51.480 --> 09:53.920
I found the explosion.

09:59.920 --> 10:02.470
Please report to your team
captain and identify yourself.

10:02.480 --> 10:03.970
Move to marshaling area echo.

10:03.980 --> 10:05.690
- there should be a team
captain there-- - shelly!

10:05.700 --> 10:06.810
Do you know what happened?

10:06.820 --> 10:08.290
Only that there was an explosion nearby.

10:08.300 --> 10:09.590
We had to evacuate this building.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.050
- they're anticipating a second wave.
- have you seen hotch or kate?

10:12.060 --> 10:13.210
No. I was hoping you did.

10:13.220 --> 10:14.660
Have you seen any of my team?

10:14.670 --> 10:15.890
Sorry, i...

10:15.900 --> 10:18.840
All right, well me must be setting up a
critical incident command center, right?

10:18.850 --> 10:21.670
700 hudson, south of laight
in the tribeca district.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.430
Ok. You see any of my
team, that's where i'll be.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.710
Ok.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.280
Move to marshaling area echo.

10:26.290 --> 10:28.540
There should be a team captain there.

10:34.330 --> 10:36.340
- oh, my god!
- they weren't inside.

10:36.350 --> 10:38.620
- they-- -
weren't inside.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.930
Right. Play it again. Right now.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.150
Move this camera.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.200
I have to see where they ended--
where--where they are now.

10:51.210 --> 10:53.430
This isn't live, penelope.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.520
Right. Get me another angle. We have
to see what happened to hotch and kate.

11:00.610 --> 11:01.910
Wait!

11:01.920 --> 11:04.030
- what are you doing?
- we're going further back.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.860
That explosion looked like it came
from under the suv, not inside it,

11:06.880 --> 11:10.150
So i'm gonna guess that bomb
wasn't there when it was parked.

11:14.260 --> 11:17.590
That's him. The bomber.

11:17.600 --> 11:22.060
Uh, get me another angle,
at timecode 12:06:06.

11:23.630 --> 11:25.920
Got him.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.630
He stopped.

11:31.010 --> 11:32.950
Sam, you need to get out of the area.

11:32.960 --> 11:33.550
I just want to help.

11:33.570 --> 11:36.410
If you want to help,
get somebody down here.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.570
Kate, i need you to wake up.

11:38.590 --> 11:42.130
Stay with me. Stay with me.

11:44.340 --> 11:45.840
- i feel cold.
- what?

11:45.850 --> 11:50.340
It's such a cliche,
isn't it? I feel cold.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.180
Like in the cinema.

11:52.190 --> 11:54.590
You've lost a lot of blood,
but i think i've got it stopped.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.130
Wait. That's not right. It's movies.

11:57.140 --> 12:00.400
Um, you say movies, not cinema.

12:00.410 --> 12:02.450
Just try to relax.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.360
Why--why would you have
a different word for...

12:08.220 --> 12:10.680
All right, if they can't get down here,
i'm gonna try to lift you and just--

12:10.690 --> 12:13.870
- they just told me to get behind the barricade.
- ok, here, i'm gonna try to lift her.

12:13.880 --> 12:16.990
All right, on 3. 1, 2, 3.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.200
No, i lost it. I lost my grip.

12:19.210 --> 12:21.720
All right, i need to find
it again. Need to find it.

12:21.730 --> 12:23.560
- kate, stay with me.
- she's bleeding. She's bleeding!

12:23.570 --> 12:25.020
I think i've got it. I think i got it.

12:25.030 --> 12:27.390
She's not gonna die, is she?

12:28.240 --> 12:30.600
Kate, stay with us, please.

12:30.610 --> 12:33.450
We're here! Please!

12:34.410 --> 12:37.220
Please! We're here!

12:37.770 --> 12:39.940
Someone!

12:52.260 --> 12:53.480
Who's in charge here?

12:53.490 --> 12:54.400
Captain warner.

12:54.410 --> 12:56.540
- ok, ok, let's get this area cleared
as soon as possible. - captain warner--

12:56.550 --> 12:57.610
We got people down there.

12:57.620 --> 12:59.820
Captain warner, i'm agent morgan, fbi.

12:59.830 --> 13:01.970
I'm looking for agent
hotchner, aaron hotchner.

13:01.980 --> 13:03.400
Go back to the federal building.

13:03.410 --> 13:04.900
There are evac marshaling spots.

13:04.910 --> 13:06.500
Check in to make sure
they know where you are.

13:06.510 --> 13:08.530
I am not about to do that.

13:08.540 --> 13:12.510
Get out of my face or i'll
have you bodily removed, agent.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.830
Please, we're here!

13:14.840 --> 13:16.560
Hotch.

13:17.300 --> 13:19.600
The area's restricted.

13:20.530 --> 13:21.870
That's my boss down there.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.000
My orders are what they are.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.730
I don't give a damn
what your orders are.

13:24.740 --> 13:25.930
I get it, agent.

13:25.940 --> 13:29.310
But we've been told by you
responders are the targets.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.910
So till the blast site is
cleared, no one goes in.

13:34.230 --> 13:37.220
You're marine corps, right? Right?

13:38.200 --> 13:40.450
Please, go back to the marshaling point.

13:40.460 --> 13:42.410
I'm not doing it.

13:42.420 --> 13:44.980
I'm not just gonna let my
man lay down there like that.

13:44.990 --> 13:48.260
Help us! Damn it, we're here!

13:49.080 --> 13:52.170
Never leave a man behind. You
do remember that, don't you?

13:52.180 --> 13:54.710
We're here! Please!

13:55.940 --> 13:57.780
Ok.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.820
Hotch! Hotch!

14:00.830 --> 14:02.910
Fast-forward it.

14:10.580 --> 14:12.470
He watched.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.960
That son of a bitch watched.

14:14.970 --> 14:16.270
Get me another timecode.

14:16.280 --> 14:19.060
12:29:13

14:20.990 --> 14:22.700
Oh, my god, that's the unsub.

14:22.710 --> 14:25.100
And he's walking right up to hotch.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.280
- hotch.
- morgan, we've got to get her out of here.

14:28.290 --> 14:30.770
They're not letting any ambulances
down here till they clear the scene.

14:30.780 --> 14:33.600
Kid, you gotta get behind
the barricades. Let's go. Go!

14:33.610 --> 14:36.050
- go, sam.
- good luck.

14:38.190 --> 14:41.020
Talk to me. Can we carry her?

14:41.330 --> 14:42.120
Hotch, can we carry her?

14:42.130 --> 14:43.040
No, i tried.

14:43.060 --> 14:47.380
Morgan, she's gonna bleed to death if we don't
get her out of here. We gotta do something.

14:47.390 --> 14:51.330
Please have service. Please have service.
Please have service. Please have service.

14:53.570 --> 14:54.730
Garcia, i got hotch.

14:54.740 --> 14:55.620
But listen to me.

14:55.640 --> 14:58.820
You gotta get somebody down here
right away, you hear me? Right now.

14:59.850 --> 15:03.770
What? You're absolutely sure?

15:05.550 --> 15:09.330
Hotch. The kid. He's the bomber.

15:09.710 --> 15:11.450
Go.

16:05.730 --> 16:09.090
She's got an arterial bleed in her back
and i'm doing my best to hold it closed.

16:09.110 --> 16:09.970
You ok?

16:09.980 --> 16:11.330
I just want to get her out of here.

16:11.340 --> 16:13.070
Her pulse is weak and thready.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.280
- i'm gonna need your help, ok?
- Ok.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.110
Is the area clear?

16:17.120 --> 16:19.660
You were calling for help
and i couldn't listen anymore.

16:19.670 --> 16:22.080
My partner was too afraid
to come in here with me.

16:22.090 --> 16:24.180
Kate, we're gonna get you out of here.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.520
We're on our way out of here.

16:26.530 --> 16:28.560
These are stills from
all the murder sites.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.830
Garcia had us on conference
and the system crashed.

16:30.840 --> 16:31.980
Emily.

16:31.990 --> 16:34.040
Oh, thank god you're
all right.where's will?

16:34.050 --> 16:37.050
He's stuck at the airport. As soon
as i heard, i went straight to 26 fed.

16:37.060 --> 16:39.690
They're evacuating the
building. Where is everyone?

16:39.700 --> 16:41.450
Morgan's all right, but
there's no word from hotch.

16:41.460 --> 16:42.530
The bomber! The bomber!

16:42.540 --> 16:44.700
- what?
- derek's chasing after him.

16:44.710 --> 16:47.240
The bomb--it was in
kate's suv or under it.

16:47.250 --> 16:48.310
Hotch is out there with her.

16:48.330 --> 16:50.450
He seems ok, but she looks
really hurt. He hasn't moved her.

16:50.460 --> 16:52.040
Where was kate's suv parked?

16:52.050 --> 16:53.530
2 blocks east of federal plaza.

16:53.550 --> 16:56.110
2 blocks east and
they target kate's suv?

16:56.120 --> 16:57.450
Have you i. D. Ed the bomber?

16:57.460 --> 17:00.000
Lisa's running him and
dead guy through vicap.

17:00.010 --> 17:01.150
Call homeland security.

17:01.160 --> 17:02.550
They should be at all the murder sites.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.560
- see if they found anything.
- i'm on it.

17:04.569 --> 17:07.089
Garcia, find out how we can help morgan.

17:07.099 --> 17:08.630
Yes, sir.

17:08.660 --> 17:12.849
This is an emergency notification all train
services are suspended until further notice.

17:12.859 --> 17:17.270
Please remain calm and exit the station.

17:17.930 --> 17:22.119
Out of my way! Move! Move!
Where did he go? Where?

17:23.890 --> 17:26.270
This is an emergency notification.

17:26.280 --> 17:30.280
All train services will be
suspended until further notice.

17:30.290 --> 17:33.620
Please remain calm and exit the station.

17:39.550 --> 17:42.430
Show your face, you son of a bitch!

19:20.150 --> 19:22.610
I know you're in here, kid!

19:25.130 --> 19:28.080
Show me your face, you coward!

19:36.830 --> 19:39.530
You got nowhere to
run, man. You hear me?

19:39.540 --> 19:41.000
There's nothing down here for you?

19:41.010 --> 19:43.350
Is that all you see?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.510
Huh? Darkness?

20:05.510 --> 20:07.850
You listen to me, you son of a bitch.

20:07.860 --> 20:10.900
You get your ass off those tracks and
you put your hands on top of your head.

20:10.930 --> 20:14.410
Do it now. Do it now!

20:16.910 --> 20:19.260
- you will lose in the end.
- shut up. Shut your mouth.

20:19.270 --> 20:21.030
You want to know why?

20:21.040 --> 20:24.870
Because you fear what we embrace.

20:24.880 --> 20:28.570
Get off the--no!
No, no, no!

20:30.050 --> 20:33.780
- on 3--1, 2,
3. - got her.

20:33.790 --> 20:34.590
Ok.

20:35.670 --> 20:37.600
Ok, i'm gonna clamp that artery.

20:37.610 --> 20:41.060
When i say move, move your hand and
get as far out of my way as you can.

20:41.070 --> 20:42.510
- you got it?
- yep.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.310
Ok, move. Ok.

20:45.320 --> 20:49.280
I need to get a bag in and start getting
her pressure up. Get the gurney from the bus.

20:52.730 --> 20:55.590
Yes, yes, i understand. Thank you.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.520
Homeland security has poured tactical
teams into all of those locations.

20:59.530 --> 21:04.240
Uh, swat, bomb techs, hrt, hazmat,
the works. They found nothing.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.080
Reid.

21:07.090 --> 21:08.930
All except one.

21:08.940 --> 21:11.760
Kate's suv-- none of the
shootings were anywhere near it.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.510
Maybe it's personal.

21:13.520 --> 21:17.040
This death card they gave
us-- they delivered on it.

21:17.060 --> 21:18.310
That's just it--
they haven't.

21:18.320 --> 21:21.470
With a cell as large as this one
and multiple targets to choose from,

21:21.480 --> 21:24.290
They target a single suv?

21:28.210 --> 21:29.560
Where's the closest emergency room?

21:29.570 --> 21:31.310
- st.barclay's.
- where?

21:31.320 --> 21:33.530
- st.barclay's.
- and where is it?

21:33.540 --> 21:36.210
It's 4 blocks uptown, one block east.

21:36.220 --> 21:37.650
Where's the emergency entrance?

21:37.660 --> 21:40.290
Under the hospital. Just
follow the signs to the e.r.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.050
Ok.

21:43.820 --> 21:47.840
Hey, look who's back. Hello.

21:47.850 --> 21:50.340
Is she awake?

21:50.350 --> 21:51.890
Is that aaron?

21:51.900 --> 21:54.240
- are you aaron?
- yeah.

21:54.580 --> 21:57.550
- kate, we made it.
- thank you.

21:57.560 --> 22:01.280
Don't thank me. Thank your
partner. He did it all.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.010
- what's this?
- secret service.

22:13.020 --> 22:15.970
We're directing all
emergencies over to lenox hill.

22:15.980 --> 22:18.290
I'm ssa hotchner. I
have ssa joyner on board.

22:18.300 --> 22:20.340
She was injured in the
bomb blast at federal plaza.

22:20.350 --> 22:21.570
Credentials.

22:21.580 --> 22:23.410
They're in my jacket at federal plaza.

22:23.420 --> 22:26.690
I appreciate that, agent, but this
hospital is on a strict bypass.

22:26.700 --> 22:27.650
What
is--what's that?

22:27.660 --> 22:30.170
It means the hospital is closed.

22:30.180 --> 22:33.260
We're redirecting all
emergencies to lenox hill.

22:33.270 --> 22:34.550
She's not gonna make it to lenox hill.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.520
I'm losing her!

22:36.530 --> 22:39.030
She's crashing! She's crashing!

22:39.040 --> 22:41.720
- please.
- i'm losing her.

22:41.730 --> 22:43.160
Open it up.

22:43.170 --> 22:46.160
His is delta 2. I need
immediate e.r.attendance.

22:48.900 --> 22:49.890
What do you got?

22:49.900 --> 22:53.970
Bp 50 over 30, she's bradycardic
with severe spinal injury.

22:53.990 --> 22:57.380
Get her in the bag.
Get in the crash cart.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.910
Let's get him on a gurney.

23:34.150 --> 23:36.680
- *****
- good. Thank god.

23:36.690 --> 23:38.740
This is the unsub morgan
chased into the subway.

23:38.750 --> 23:39.770
This is the one prentiss shot.

23:39.780 --> 23:41.180
Garcia's running them through vicap.

23:41.190 --> 23:44.990
These are smart, well-educated kids,
hand-picked and trained to be martyrs.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
They're not gonna be in any government
file and they won't have rap sheets.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.930
Hotch and kate are at
st. Barclay's hospital.

23:49.940 --> 23:50.910
How are they?

23:50.920 --> 23:53.050
Well, hotch is in the
e.r., kate's in surgery.

23:53.060 --> 23:54.360
Morgan's on his way down there now.

23:54.370 --> 23:57.520
The media's reporting this as a
failed attack on 26 federal plaza.

23:57.530 --> 23:58.200
Well, it's not.

23:58.220 --> 24:00.910
They're not the only ones. Homeland
security feels the same way.

24:00.920 --> 24:01.620
They're wrong.

24:01.630 --> 24:05.510
They found nothing at any of the sites that
you told them that these guys were targeting.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.090
Maybe this thing is over.

24:07.130 --> 24:10.180
Or maybe that's exactly
what they want us to think.

24:10.190 --> 24:12.930
As soon as the bomb techs identify
the device, i want to know about it.

24:12.940 --> 24:13.590
Of course.

24:13.620 --> 24:16.180
Can you get in tighter on the bomber?

24:16.190 --> 24:18.850
Here, in his hand. He's
using his cell phone.

24:18.860 --> 24:20.790
Joyner and hotch approach the van.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.200
Why not wait until they both get in?

24:22.210 --> 24:23.920
Guess he figured he was close enough.

24:23.940 --> 24:25.750
Wouldn't you wait until they were in it?

24:25.760 --> 24:28.680
- so far these guys have accomplished nothing.
- nothing?

24:28.950 --> 24:30.860
My partner was
shot--cooper?

24:30.870 --> 24:32.530
8 innocent people were killed.

24:32.540 --> 24:33.630
2 agents blown up.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.470
Not to mention emily's suicide
by cop. Is that not enough?

24:37.480 --> 24:39.770
That was memorable.

24:41.910 --> 24:44.060
This isn't.

24:45.630 --> 24:47.710
Doc. Fbi.

24:47.720 --> 24:48.980
How's aaron hotchner?

24:48.990 --> 24:52.930
He's got acute acoustic trauma in his right
ear, and i pulled shrapnel from his leg.

24:52.940 --> 24:55.150
Just lay down. Sir!

24:55.160 --> 24:57.200
Agent hotchner, lie down.

24:57.210 --> 24:59.840
- doctor, i'm all right.
- hotch, stop it. Just calm down.

24:59.850 --> 25:01.540
- doc, i got it, ok?
- morgan, where's kate?

25:01.550 --> 25:02.910
She's in surgery.

25:02.920 --> 25:04.420
Where are my clothes, please?

25:04.430 --> 25:06.950
Hotch, your go bag is on its way.

25:07.850 --> 25:09.480
Has anything happened
since the first blast?

25:09.490 --> 25:10.760
Nothing.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.800
- sam?
- he's dead.

25:13.890 --> 25:15.320
Morgan, the profile's wrong.

25:15.330 --> 25:18.790
Everything--everything they've done so
far has appeared to be something it's not.

25:18.800 --> 25:19.470
I don't follow.

25:19.480 --> 25:23.280
The seemingly random acts of murder, the attempt
to hack into our security surveillance systems.

25:23.290 --> 25:26.030
The suicide by cop to make us
all believe that it was over.

25:26.040 --> 25:28.380
Don't forget the death card
telling us they know we're watching.

25:28.400 --> 25:29.220
All diversions.

25:29.230 --> 25:33.360
To ensure our attention and analysis of any given
situation would than incorrectly inform our profile.

25:33.370 --> 25:35.730
So the first responders
were not the real target?

25:35.740 --> 25:38.560
- hotch and kate were a diversion, too?
- from what?

25:38.570 --> 25:40.790
Morgan. Hotch wants
you guys over there now.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.130
What do we tell homeland security?

25:43.140 --> 25:46.360
Tell them if they love this city as
much as you do to keep it locked down.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.880
It's about to get hit.

25:54.270 --> 25:56.420
Are you ok?

25:56.430 --> 25:58.800
Yeah. I just want to
understand why i'm still alive.

25:58.810 --> 26:01.530
I think the idea was
to maim, not to kill.

26:01.540 --> 26:03.650
Did you identify sam, the bomber?

26:03.660 --> 26:07.260
Garcia put sam and the other dead
unsub into every know database. Nothing.

26:07.270 --> 26:08.800
We know how terror cells evolve.

26:08.810 --> 26:10.800
They learn from one
campaign to the next.

26:10.820 --> 26:13.020
How to stay off radar
like the london bombers.

26:13.030 --> 26:15.770
Yeah, but they, uh, they
hit at 8:50 in the morning

26:15.780 --> 26:19.110
With a series of coordinated blasts
aimed at london's transportation system,

26:19.120 --> 26:23.860
And this cell targeted a lone suv where the
only people on the street are 2 federal agents.

26:23.870 --> 26:26.010
It's not multiple
targets, it's one target.

26:26.030 --> 26:27.580
One target, one bomb.

26:27.590 --> 26:31.400
Garcia said the device was
placed under kate's suv.

26:31.410 --> 26:33.180
It was likely made
using oxydizing agents,

26:33.190 --> 26:36.720
Including chromates,peroxides,
perchlorates, chlorates, and red mercury,

26:36.730 --> 26:39.150
All jammed into a device
no larger than a cell phone.

26:39.160 --> 26:42.410
Imagine what a bomb the
size of an oil drum could do.

26:42.710 --> 26:45.310
Yeah, but to make something that
big, you'd need a chemical engineer.

26:45.320 --> 26:51.110
Like the recently deceased dr. Azahari
husin, asia's most-wanted bomb-maker?

26:51.120 --> 26:55.170
Authorities dubbed him
the, uh, demolition man.

26:57.120 --> 27:00.250
He treated each bomb like a work of art.

27:00.260 --> 27:02.320
One wrong move...

27:02.330 --> 27:05.340
He becomes a victim of his own creation.

27:05.350 --> 27:10.430
He'll be more revered than all of the
people who died as a result of his devices.

27:10.440 --> 27:12.360
Stop the bomber, stop the bomb.

27:12.370 --> 27:15.020
To do that, we need to know how
they would deploy something that big.

27:15.030 --> 27:16.900
Hotch.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.540
- did you ever find sam's cell phone?
- yes.

27:27.550 --> 27:29.610
- did he call 911?
- no.

27:29.620 --> 27:31.860
He dialed one number 6
times every few minutes.

27:31.870 --> 27:33.150
It was a disposable cell.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.870
Garcia tracked the number, but it
went dead minutes after sam died.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.380
Whoever had it destroyed it.

27:37.390 --> 27:39.950
Well, if he didn't have a
secondary device to detonate,

27:39.960 --> 27:42.230
There's only one reason
that he stayed with us.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.530
To make sure the ambulance got to you.

27:44.550 --> 27:48.040
And in a city on lockdown, an ambulance
with its siren blaring and lights on,

27:48.070 --> 27:52.500
It's gonna make it through every
roadblock virtually uncontested.

27:52.510 --> 27:54.810
This hospital is on a strict bypass.

27:54.830 --> 27:55.760
What
is--what's that?

27:55.770 --> 27:58.270
It means the hospital is closed.

27:58.280 --> 28:01.140
- and straight into a hospital with a bypass order on it.
- what?

28:01.150 --> 28:03.230
Secret service has a
bypass on this hospital.

28:03.240 --> 28:05.220
Secret service? Who are they protecting?

28:05.230 --> 28:07.550
That's who sam was calling,
the paramedic on the ambulance.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.680
The ambulance which i drove in here.

28:09.690 --> 28:12.860
This hospital is their target. Let's go.

29:09.100 --> 29:10.570
Who you got in here?

29:10.580 --> 29:11.740
Why is that information
important to you?

29:11.750 --> 29:13.440
The ambulance i drove in
here-- where is it now?

29:13.470 --> 29:15.300
- in the basement. Why?
- there's a bomb in it.

29:15.310 --> 29:16.120
- what?
- it's rigged.

29:16.130 --> 29:18.590
It's rigged to assassinate
whoever it is you're protecting.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.970
You need to get them and everyone
else out of here right now.

29:20.990 --> 29:23.000
We can't do that. He's
undergoing surgery as we speak.

29:23.010 --> 29:26.070
The paramedic i came in
with-- do you have eyes on him?

29:26.080 --> 29:27.240
That a cell in his hands?

29:27.250 --> 29:30.830
Garcia, can you remote access the cell phone
grid i'm in and jam all the frequencies?

29:30.840 --> 29:32.820
Yeah, i can, but only for
a short period of time.

29:32.830 --> 29:34.820
There's a bomb in the
basement of this building.

29:34.830 --> 29:35.790
I'm on it.

29:35.800 --> 29:39.830
Ok, we need to access and pinpoint the
3 closest cell towers to the location

29:39.840 --> 29:43.620
And then disrupt the satellite feeds to
them and we need to do it fast. Here we go.

29:45.560 --> 29:47.020
Look, he's coming back.

29:47.030 --> 29:49.220
He's gonna detonate the
bomb manually if he has to.

29:49.230 --> 29:50.090
Where did morgan go?

29:50.100 --> 29:51.070
He went to find the ambulance.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.040
- alone?
- let's head down.

29:53.050 --> 29:55.850
Call air charlie one. Move echo one to
the roof as soon as he's out of surgery.

29:55.860 --> 29:59.670
Air-vac him out of here. The rest
of us, we'll take the elevators.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.340
Morgan?

30:10.700 --> 30:12.720
Yeah, baby.

30:12.730 --> 30:15.910
- you sound stressed.
- do i?

30:16.480 --> 30:18.280
Where are you?

30:19.080 --> 30:21.970
Not where i want to be right now.

30:34.310 --> 30:36.800
Garcia, take this down for me. Fdny 108.

30:36.810 --> 30:38.450
That's an ambulance.So you ok?

30:38.460 --> 30:39.590
Yeah.I'm fine.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.320
*******

30:59.040 --> 31:01.370
- he's going to the basement.
- stairs.

31:10.230 --> 31:12.130
Oh, my god.

31:12.690 --> 31:15.820
Garcia, how long can you keep jamming the cell phone lines?

31:15.840 --> 31:18.450
Uh, a few minutes, max.
Why?

31:19.580 --> 31:21.580
'Cause i'm gonna have to get this ambulance out of here.

31:21.590 --> 31:23.630
Or you could just evacuate the building like everybody else.

31:23.640 --> 31:26.580
No.
As soon as the airways are clear, this thing's going up.

31:26.590 --> 31:28.650
Going up?Oh, my god, that's like 3 minutes, 

31:28.660 --> 31:31.080
'Cause that's when the satellite moves position.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.460
Come on.

31:44.640 --> 31:47.050
Garcia, listen to me.

31:47.060 --> 31:48.990
I need you to find an area of town i can drive this thing, 

31:49.000 --> 31:51.360
And you tell everybody, you hear me, everybody that i'm coming.

31:51.370 --> 31:53.020
Come on, babe.

31:53.030 --> 31:56.000
Do it!
Go!

31:57.330 --> 31:59.030
All right, talk to me, garcia.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.230
Ok.
Head north...

32:01.620 --> 32:04.360
And floor it.
I'll tell you where to turn.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.340
What was that?

32:10.360 --> 32:12.660
It was nothing.
Just talk to me!

32:12.670 --> 32:16.330
No!
No!
Nooo!

32:19.870 --> 32:22.380
Noooo!

32:56.370 --> 32:58.230
Prentiss.

33:08.110 --> 33:09.370
How am i doing, garcia?

33:09.380 --> 33:10.240
How's he doing?

33:10.250 --> 33:11.670
One minute, 50 seconds.

33:11.680 --> 33:12.890
Why does it always have to be you?

33:12.900 --> 33:14.980
Why do you always have to do this?

33:23.020 --> 33:25.020
{\a6}<i>NO SIGNAL</i>

33:38.340 --> 33:40.570
Come on.
Come on!

33:45.060 --> 33:46.230
Derek, you don't have much time.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.260
Please be smart about this.

33:49.820 --> 33:51.300
Signal's coming back online.

33:51.310 --> 33:53.030
30 seconds to full coverage.

33:53.040 --> 33:55.050
Derek, drive to the opening and then get the hell out.

33:55.060 --> 33:56.890
- there's something i really want you to know, garcia.
- 20 seconds.

33:56.900 --> 33:59.040
Save it.
Just get out.

33:59.050 --> 34:01.120
- no, no, no, i'm not quite there yet.
- 10...

34:01.130 --> 34:02.430
- morgan...
- just listen to me.

34:02.440 --> 34:03.970
- 9...
8...
- morgan, please.

34:03.980 --> 34:06.110
You know what you are, garcia?

34:08.210 --> 34:10.060
{\a6}<i>CALL CONNECTER</i>

34:10.889 --> 34:13.080
- we just lost tracking.
- morgan!

34:34.219 --> 34:36.190
Derek?

34:44.440 --> 34:46.350
Fbi.

34:50.010 --> 34:52.489
Put it down.
It's over.

35:12.590 --> 35:14.620
Garcia...

35:15.090 --> 35:17.500
I'll tell you what you are to me.

35:18.290 --> 35:21.340
You're my god-given solace.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.880
Woman, you promise me one thing...

35:25.460 --> 35:27.370
Whatever happens...

35:27.380 --> 35:30.190
Don't you ever stop talking to me.

35:30.210 --> 35:33.110
I can't right now 'cause i'm mad at you.

35:33.120 --> 35:35.640
I can wait.

36:38.330 --> 36:41.000
What's happening?
Where's the surgeon?

36:43.970 --> 36:46.520
We did all that we could.

36:48.960 --> 36:51.130
I'm so sorry.

37:45.740 --> 37:47.400
I'm telling you, we're gonna get caught.

37:47.410 --> 37:49.890
Come on, kid, we're cops.

37:49.900 --> 37:53.340
Smoking in a hospital is a federal offense.

37:55.260 --> 37:57.720
You're on your own, kid.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.790
I see the wife and kids came for a visit.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.820
Have you told them you started smoking again?

38:06.830 --> 38:10.020
Give me a break.
I just got shot.

38:10.400 --> 38:14.490
Now i'm standing in front of a beautiful woman in this ridiculous garb with a...

38:14.500 --> 38:18.300
I.
V.
And a catheter connected to my...
Skididdibup.

38:20.360 --> 38:21.480
Could've told me you were coming.

38:21.490 --> 38:23.610
Yeah, i wasn't going to and i...

38:23.630 --> 38:26.060
I thought i'd drop in...

38:26.970 --> 38:29.450
- i'm on my way to the airport now.
- yeah.

38:34.630 --> 38:37.230
Sorry to hear about agent joyner.

38:37.240 --> 38:39.080
And hotchner-- is he ok?

38:39.090 --> 38:43.120
Uh, he can't fly for a little bit.
His ears are...
But he's gonna be fine.

38:43.130 --> 38:46.780
Um, so--ok, i brought this for you.
For you and your family.

38:46.790 --> 38:50.370
I'm told they are great seats.

38:50.380 --> 38:51.530
You didn't have to.

38:51.540 --> 38:54.690
I know.
I wanted to.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.430
Could just as easily have been me.

38:57.440 --> 39:01.280
Well...
I'm glad it wasn't.

39:06.320 --> 39:10.400
Got a plane to catch, so...
Take care, cooper.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.800
Mets tickets?

39:16.810 --> 39:20.020
Most people assume i'm a yankees fan.

39:20.700 --> 39:23.200
I'm not most people.

39:27.020 --> 39:31.120
Nope.
No, that girl is not.

39:36.810 --> 39:38.340
Thanks.

39:40.400 --> 39:42.790
Got it.
I'm your ride.

39:43.140 --> 39:44.710
I thought agent davis was driving me.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.970
She was.
I had her reassigned.

39:46.980 --> 39:48.530
Don't you have something better to do?

39:48.540 --> 39:51.550
Than to annoy you for 3 hours?
Hell, no.

39:51.960 --> 39:54.710
- give me the keys.
- not a chance, hotch.

39:55.110 --> 39:56.560
Let's go.

39:59.950 --> 40:03.510
So did we ever find out who the secret service had in the hospital?

40:04.140 --> 40:06.300
Does it matter?

40:06.790 --> 40:09.140
No, i guess it doesn't.

40:10.380 --> 40:14.110
Quantico's requested you transfer to run the new york office.

40:14.700 --> 40:16.350
Hotch, they haven't even buried her yet.

40:16.360 --> 40:18.500
We're at war.
Things change.

40:18.510 --> 40:21.230
Don't i need your recommendation?

40:25.480 --> 40:28.050
You didn't give it, did you?

40:30.680 --> 40:34.820
Your actions, as incredibly brave as they were...

40:34.830 --> 40:38.780
Would still be actions of an agent who doesn't truly trust anyone.

40:39.090 --> 40:42.020
Hotch, i did it for this team.

40:42.030 --> 40:44.910
My opinion doesn't matter.
Job's yours if you want it.

40:44.920 --> 40:49.130
Hotch.
Your opinion matters to me.

40:51.290 --> 40:55.420
My life matters to me, and i have and always will entrust you with it.

40:58.460 --> 41:01.140
Would you do the same for me?

41:07.320 --> 41:09.050
Still want to drive?
