FLANDERS:
Okily dokily.

Aw, our own home.

01:28.522 --> 01:29.490
(Grampa snoring)

01:29.523 --> 01:32.593
All right. Takeout Chinese.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.328
Everyone can have
their favorite thing.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.597
Bart, General Tso's chicken.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.500
For Lisa, Pacifist Tso's tofu.

01:39.533 --> 01:42.102
For Maggie, Kung Pao Cheerios.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.505
And, Homer,
I've got your favorite...

01:44.538 --> 01:46.106
Favorite? That's my favorite.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.108
...MSG.

01:50.178 --> 01:51.179
Mmm.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.680
Ah, needs salt.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.215
(cell phone ringing)

01:55.783 --> 01:57.151
Y'ello.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.486
Ahoy-hoy, Simpson.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.188
I have four seats to tonight's
basketball joust,

02:00.221 --> 02:02.323
and you were
at the top of my list.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.868
So, what do you say?

02:14.902 --> 02:16.103
Thank you, Mr. Burns.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.105
Oh, boy, courtside seats.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.007
I feel like
Billy Crystal's doctor.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.108
Who was it?

02:21.141 --> 02:23.110
You'll never believe it.
We just got...

02:23.143 --> 02:25.946
HOMER'S BRAIN: Homer, wait.
You don't want to go with them.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.315
Why not? They're my family.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.517
Sweetie, I know that
you're talking to your brain.

02:29.550 --> 02:32.486
Why don't you just do
whatever your heart tells you?

02:32.520 --> 02:34.121
Ugh, not that guy.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.156
(shouts) I'm numb.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.925
Chest pains!

02:40.928 --> 02:43.197
Just go to the game
with your friends.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.032
Brain, you're the greatest.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.834
Is there anything
I can do for you?

02:46.867 --> 02:49.002
Yeah, you could read a book
once in a while.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.538
D'oh!

02:52.440 --> 02:54.842
Carl, I got courtside seats!

02:54.875 --> 02:57.010
Lenny, I got courtside seats!

02:57.044 --> 02:59.146
Barney, I got courtside seats!

02:59.179 --> 02:59.980
I'm in.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.815
Who's on trial?

03:01.849 --> 03:04.352
You guys got courtside seats?
I'd love to go.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.287
Just let me lock up
the good liquor.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.360
Uh, sorry, we only have
four tickets.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.061
Me, Lenny, Carl and Barney.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.696
You really don't want me?

03:15.729 --> 03:17.498
I, uh, I thought we was friends.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.066
Yeah, we did, too.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.901
Then we realized
you were serving us beer

03:20.934 --> 03:22.069
that's mostly suds.

03:22.102 --> 03:24.905
Also, your chicken wings
weren't chicken.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.907
Hey, meat's meat.
Although none of it was meat.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.342
Look, hey, where we going
with this?

03:28.376 --> 03:30.077
You're not invited, Moe.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.179
Hey, wha...?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.947
LENNY:
Not invited, not invited.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.617
BARNEY:
Who's on trial?

03:36.650 --> 03:38.452
*

03:47.295 --> 03:50.931
Wow. Wow. I am truly alone
in this world.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.100
ROBOTIC FEMALE VOICE:
No, you're not.

03:53.133 --> 03:55.936
Uh, thanks, uh,
Anti-Suicide Keychain.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.237
ROBOTIC FEMALE VOICE:
You're welcome.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.739
I care about you...

03:58.772 --> 04:00.140
MOE (on keychain):
Uh, Moe Szyslak.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.875
ROBOTIC FEMALE VOICE:
...very much.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.076
(sniffles)

04:08.349 --> 04:10.451
Uh, Moe, about last night...

04:10.484 --> 04:12.119
Yeah, on the house, fellas.

04:12.152 --> 04:13.253
(all gasp)

04:13.287 --> 04:15.323
And I got new cocktail napkins

04:15.356 --> 04:17.224
that ain't just
unpaid parking tickets.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.159
See? Yeah, huh?

04:19.192 --> 04:20.761
How about that?

04:20.794 --> 04:23.631
Why you being so nice to us
after we rejected you?

04:23.664 --> 04:26.834
Well, maybe the problem
wasn't youse, maybe it was mees.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.169
So, I'se, uh,
sprucing up the bar,

04:29.202 --> 04:31.972
trying to make things nice,
you know, like they used to be.

04:32.005 --> 04:35.943
Hey! It's the Pin Pals,
our old bowling team!

04:35.976 --> 04:37.845
Those were great times.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.613
Them were the best times.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.949
Closer than brothers,
we was, says I.

04:41.982 --> 04:45.018
Then Apu had his octopuses,
and suddenly he didn't have time

04:45.052 --> 04:47.955
to bowl with his buddies
five nights a week.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.123
But as I said, great times.

04:54.194 --> 04:57.631
Guys, I think we should
reform the Pin Pals,

04:57.665 --> 05:01.168
but this time with
me, Lenny, Carl and Moe!

05:01.201 --> 05:03.103
(gasps)
Oh, guys, I would love to!

05:03.136 --> 05:05.639
But I can't bowl no more.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.141
I got beer-pull tunnel syndrome.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.211
Ow!

05:12.045 --> 05:14.081
Another, please.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.083
Ow!

05:17.084 --> 05:19.387
It's a little short.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.121
(grunts in pain)

05:21.154 --> 05:24.157
I guess you'll have to ask
Barney to bowl with ya's.

05:24.191 --> 05:26.694
-Do they have beer?
-Yes.

05:26.727 --> 05:29.029
To bowling!

05:29.062 --> 05:30.631
* I get knocked down

05:30.664 --> 05:31.999
* But I get up again

05:32.032 --> 05:34.167
* You're never
gonna keep me down... *

05:35.168 --> 05:37.905
Moe, this is for you.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.174
Ah.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.076
-What do you say?
-Coach? Terrific!

05:43.110 --> 05:46.079
I love screaming at people
who are trying their best.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.681
OTHERS:
To Moe!

05:47.715 --> 05:49.316
What are you doing?
Don't drink that.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.718
You're in training.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.052
* The boys are back in town

05:52.085 --> 05:54.087
* Boys are back in town...

05:56.189 --> 05:59.092
A lot of music in this episode.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.294
* The boys are back in town

06:02.530 --> 06:04.064
* The boys are back in town

06:04.097 --> 06:05.499
* Boys are back in town

06:05.533 --> 06:07.067

06:20.147 --> 06:21.582

06:21.615 --> 06:23.083
* Boys are back in town

06:25.419 --> 06:28.789
* I said the boys
are back in town *

06:28.822 --> 06:31.425
* The boys are back in town...

06:31.459 --> 06:34.628
Okay, sidekicks,
back in our shadows.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.136
CHOIR:
* Hallelujah

06:43.170 --> 06:45.138
* Hallelujah.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.315
-Yay!
-Yay!

07:07.427 --> 07:08.629
We made it, boys.

07:08.662 --> 07:12.399
Going to the state finals
in Capital City!

07:12.432 --> 07:14.134
(grunting)

07:14.167 --> 07:17.838
Uh, sorry, that's where we store
our extra balls.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.773
Quick! Rest his head!

07:20.708 --> 07:22.442
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

07:22.476 --> 07:23.844
Ow! Ow!

07:27.214 --> 07:28.616
MOE:
All right, the state finals.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.919
If we win this, the next
tournament is on ESPN8.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.087
All right, guys,
don't be yokels.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.490
Just act like
you seen it all before.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.091
Holy crap!

07:38.125 --> 07:39.893
(classical music playing)

07:43.296 --> 07:45.533
(electronic dance music playing)

07:55.543 --> 07:57.477
Uh, it says we're on lane 17.

07:57.511 --> 08:00.013
Wow! Topiary lane numbers.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.282
I'll bet they're plastic.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.818
Yep, they are,
but don't tell management.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.121
So I guess we're playing
you guys, huh?

08:08.155 --> 08:09.657
Best two out of three.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.125
I'm Reynolds.
We're high-frequency traders.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.562
I was the model for
The Wolf of Wall Street.

08:14.595 --> 08:17.164
I was the model
for American Psycho.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.969
I was a model for toe fungus
in a Dr. Scholl's commercial.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.805
-And I was... -I'll give you
$100 to stop talking.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.174
Deal!

08:27.207 --> 08:30.077
Hey, and here's a hundred
for you for looking at me

08:30.110 --> 08:33.013
like I am the most
amazing thing you ever saw.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.883
I think I'm giving you
a $500 look.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.251
Well, here's $400,
and screw you.

08:38.285 --> 08:42.723
Wow. I finally found
my path in life: socio.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.025
Hey, Harold, buddy.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.060
You know, I was wondering...

08:48.095 --> 08:50.564
Excuse me.
Why cheeseburgers?

08:50.598 --> 08:53.066
The cheese holds it together
in flight. Duh.

08:53.100 --> 08:56.103
I mean, why do you throw them
at good people?

08:56.136 --> 08:57.437
Question time is over.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.406
Really hope that social worker
pays better

08:59.439 --> 09:00.941
by the time you grow up.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.776
(chuckles) Social worker.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.012
Hey. This little dingus gets it.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.614
All right, little man.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.049
From now on,
we're gonna call you McDingus.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.118
You're treating me like dirt!

09:11.151 --> 09:12.620
(chuckles)
I belong!

09:12.653 --> 09:13.987
(phone vibrates)

09:15.055 --> 09:16.657
I'm wearing a new hat!

09:19.660 --> 09:22.229
I'm gonna show you
that the one thing in the world

09:22.262 --> 09:24.765
that you're a little bit
good at, I'm better.

09:24.798 --> 09:25.999
Okey-doke.

09:29.002 --> 09:29.970
Damn it!

09:30.003 --> 09:31.238
All right, now, listen to me.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.106
These stuffed suits
don't stand a chance

09:33.140 --> 09:34.875
against us working joes.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.810
-Because we got...
-Moxie?

09:36.844 --> 09:38.211
-Eh, no.
-Uh, grit?

09:38.245 --> 09:39.780
Nah, we're pretty grit-less.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.414
Well, what have we got?

09:41.448 --> 09:43.050
My stepdad is Lebanese.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.752
We are a damn rainbow!

09:44.785 --> 09:45.986
-Yay!
-Yeah!

09:52.693 --> 09:54.161
We win. We win!

09:54.194 --> 09:55.963
The first out of three!

09:55.996 --> 09:57.798
Huh! I haven't been
this confident

09:57.831 --> 10:00.167
since I saw La La Land
win Best Picture

10:00.200 --> 10:01.835
and turned off my TV.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.070
Good win, you guys.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.104
Lunch is on us.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.740
Wow! Is that a Visa
double diamond card?

10:06.774 --> 10:09.442
Yep. Doesn't have to be
inserted or swiped.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.812
-It just knows.
-Wow!

10:11.845 --> 10:14.147
-(zapping)
-It can sense that you're poor.

10:15.883 --> 10:19.019
Once again they substitute
rhino for narwhal.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.454
(scoffs) It's like they think
we won't notice.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.992
Thanks for lunch.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.995
And now you'll be
eating crow for dessert.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.963
Uh, side note--
I have actually eaten crow.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.332
It is not bad.
Tastes like seagull.

10:32.365 --> 10:36.036
Chang-stein, I bet you
that I can break down

10:36.069 --> 10:40.841
this loser right here
in, oh, 15 seconds.

10:40.874 --> 10:44.978
Moe, I would like to ask you
about your last birthday.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.546
W-Why? W-What have you heard?

10:46.579 --> 10:47.848
Did you have a party?

10:47.881 --> 10:49.349
-No, sir.
-(Lisa groans)

10:49.382 --> 10:51.218
-Cake? -No.
-(Lisa whimpers)

10:51.251 --> 10:53.787
Ah, man, it looks like
he's tearing Moe a new one.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.522
Well, most of his old ones
are pretty bad,

10:55.555 --> 10:56.957
so that could be a good thing.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.658
So, did you leave your house?

10:58.692 --> 11:00.293
No. (sobs)

11:00.327 --> 11:01.328
Any phone calls?

11:01.361 --> 11:03.296
-Y-Yes.
-Meant for you?

11:03.330 --> 11:06.033
No! (sobbing)

11:06.066 --> 11:09.002
I pretended to be someone
who was interested

11:09.036 --> 11:11.839
in carpet cleaning.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.174
(watch chiming)

11:14.207 --> 11:17.644
Um, that's time, and he is
definitely crying, so you win.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.513
Bart, you don't want
to be with these guys.

11:20.547 --> 11:21.849
They're monsters.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.084
Hey, their 401(k)s
are monsters.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.720
Do you even know
what a 401(k) is?

11:26.754 --> 11:28.488
I assume it's a gun.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.490
Yeah, well, I may not have much,

11:30.523 --> 11:32.860
but I got some things
that matter, huh?

11:32.893 --> 11:35.095
My bar, my friends,
my good name.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.529
OTHERS:
Hear! Hear!

11:36.563 --> 11:39.099
All right, well, if you believe
in your friends so much,

11:39.132 --> 11:41.935
how about we make
a little wager on the match?

11:41.969 --> 11:44.872
-Uh, oh, can I bet
on youse to win? -No.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.875
Careful, Moe.
I got a bad feeling about this.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.277
Just leave us be, huh?

11:50.310 --> 11:53.080
All right, how about this?
If we win the next two games,

11:53.113 --> 11:56.116
your bar is ours,
and you have to change

11:56.149 --> 11:57.951
your, uh, good name.

11:57.985 --> 12:00.187
LENNY:
I got a bad feeling.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.189
ALL (chanting):
Bad feeling, bad feeling,

12:02.222 --> 12:05.092
(all gasp)

12:05.125 --> 12:07.961
But if I win, I want something
I can share with my friends.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.931
Something only a rich guy
like you can give us.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.466
Let's do this.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.103
MOE: Look at me, Moe Szyslak,
shaking hands with a guy

12:16.136 --> 12:19.139
wearing a shirt worth more than
I'll earn in my entire life.

12:19.172 --> 12:23.276
REYNOLDS: Ugh, it feels like
I'm shaking hands with a squid.

12:23.310 --> 12:26.279
No, the squid has
a much firmer grip.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.782
REYNOLDS:
Hey, Pin Gals.

12:28.816 --> 12:31.084
ALL:
Wha...?

12:31.118 --> 12:33.787
Hey, hey, hey, we ain't afraid
of no bowling shirts.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.989
They're not shirts;
it's compression wear,

12:36.023 --> 12:37.825
which increases blood flow
to our arms

12:37.858 --> 12:39.592
and decreases wind resistance.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.797
Oh, yeah!

12:43.831 --> 12:45.565
They know two-handed bowling.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.967
Hey, we been hustled!

12:47.000 --> 12:49.102
Huh, if you can't trust
hedge fund guys,

12:49.136 --> 12:50.137
who can you trust?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.073
(pins clatter)

12:53.106 --> 12:54.341
Nice toss.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.143
Um, nobody likes suck-ups.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.145
All right? Cheeseburger.

12:58.178 --> 13:01.114
I want to help you
stand up to them.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.349
But they're traders.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.684
All we know is
how to collect information.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.854
Everyone has a weak spot.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.957
We will aggregate
their emotional responses

13:09.990 --> 13:12.459
and run a regression
through the data.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.461
Thanks for dumbing it down
for us.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.496
Polish your balls?

13:16.529 --> 13:18.598
Man, this alley does everything.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.201
Oh, I don't work for the alley.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.403
No, indeed.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.276
Bart?

13:29.309 --> 13:31.278
Hey, Mom, I got
a question for you.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.947
-Am I too young to start
drinking vodka? -Yes.

13:33.981 --> 13:36.049
Wish you would've
told me that an hour ago.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.951
Here's a little
"don't tell Homer" money.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.787
If you love money
with all your heart,

13:40.820 --> 13:42.789
the money will never
love you back.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.858
Will having no money
make me happy?

13:44.892 --> 13:46.994
No.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.795
Does Bill Gates love his wife?

13:48.828 --> 13:51.031
Melinda? Of course he does.

13:51.064 --> 13:54.501
They started a foundation
that does wonderful things.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.503
-With money, right?
-Yes.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.739
So, money's the answer
for everything.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.375
Have a C-note, sweetheart.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.577
-She gets it.
-Oh!

14:08.949 --> 14:11.084
Whew, they really
kicked our butts.

14:11.118 --> 14:14.087
(pants) I'm gonna lose
my bar and my name.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.156
No Moe, no tavern, nothing.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.658
I'm gonna jump into
that empty elevator shaft!

14:18.691 --> 14:19.993
Moe, no!

14:20.027 --> 14:21.061
(panting)

14:21.094 --> 14:22.729
(screams)

14:24.131 --> 14:27.500
I just, uh... I can't win.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.736
(straining)

14:29.769 --> 14:31.438
Oh, yeah, now we're
getting somewhere. (grunts)

14:35.475 --> 14:37.477
*

14:43.951 --> 14:45.385
All right, we've come
to that time--

14:45.418 --> 14:47.520
the time where I give
that inspirational speech

14:47.554 --> 14:49.122
I've been keeping in my pocket.

14:49.156 --> 14:50.423
(clears throat)

14:50.457 --> 14:52.625
You have given
this lonely little man

14:52.659 --> 14:55.295
a reason to get up
every single day,

14:55.328 --> 14:57.864
and that is why
I love youse, Marge.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.766
I mean, uh, Pin Pals.
Pin Pals.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.134
(cheering)

15:01.168 --> 15:02.402
And we got a secret weapon.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.637
This guy is sober.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.975
I am, because of the love
of your sister.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.442
Now, just so you know,
that was,

15:09.476 --> 15:11.111
that was a catfish thing, right?

15:11.144 --> 15:12.879
What's a "catfish" thing?

15:12.912 --> 15:14.914
I'll explain it to you
after the match.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.083
Just don't drink.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.785
You know how, uh,
how Miriam hates it.

15:18.818 --> 15:22.255
You know, you sister looks
just like Jennifer Lawrence.

15:22.289 --> 15:25.158
And all her pictures say
"Getty Images."

15:25.192 --> 15:27.427
Yeah, that's-that's a problem
with your computer.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.896
Just stay sober, huh?

15:29.929 --> 15:30.930
Mm-hmm.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.566
Huh?

15:33.600 --> 15:36.136
(choir singing ethereal music)

15:39.139 --> 15:43.043
Hey, have you ever tasted
liquid gold?

15:49.116 --> 15:51.551
You realize that was
a thousand-dollar swallow.

15:53.486 --> 15:56.756
Return... to me.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.858
(classical music playing)

16:01.794 --> 16:04.331

George Baker Selection playing)

16:08.201 --> 16:10.303
*

16:17.010 --> 16:18.245
* Yeah.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.518
(music stops)

16:29.356 --> 16:31.491
Oh, what do you want?

16:31.524 --> 16:33.460
Fair warning:
we have combed through

16:33.493 --> 16:36.996
all the emotional data on you
to find your soft targets.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.865
What the hell
are you talking about?

16:38.898 --> 16:42.169
You'll see, in just 15 seconds.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.504
Reynolds,
artificial intelligence

16:44.537 --> 16:47.407
is just three months away
from taking your job.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.410
Without my job,
I... I'm just a douche.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.479
You don't know
that the other two

16:52.512 --> 16:54.381
are sleeping with your wife.

16:54.414 --> 16:57.550
I thought you were, but you?!

16:57.584 --> 16:59.586
You're all about your BMW,

16:59.619 --> 17:02.089
but you couldn't afford
the sport package.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.990
-(Wilhelm scream)
-(buzzer sounds)

17:04.023 --> 17:08.228
And I win, just like
all good people always win.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.030
-McDingus.
-Yes, Father?

17:11.064 --> 17:14.000
Throw this at your sister.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.168
You won't do it, Bart.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.003
Why not?
It's you and it's me,

17:17.036 --> 17:19.005
and it wastes food.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.007
You won't do it
because, deep down,

17:21.040 --> 17:23.076
there's something weird
that connects us.

17:23.110 --> 17:24.177
You're crazy.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.912
Neither of us admits it,

17:25.945 --> 17:27.080
but it's there.

17:27.114 --> 17:29.116
I hold myself out to you.

17:29.149 --> 17:32.519
Go on, make my face
the home of the Whopper.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.721
I-I can't do it.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.923
You do like me. You do!

17:36.956 --> 17:40.393
And we'll always keep this
burger as a symbol of our fr...

17:40.427 --> 17:42.229
(chewing noisily)

17:42.262 --> 17:45.298
May I wax your alley?

17:45.332 --> 17:47.134
Will you get out of here?!

17:47.167 --> 17:49.902
All right, this is it, the
tenth frame, the final frame.

17:49.936 --> 17:52.972
The frame where you start
looking for your regular shoes.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.976
All right, Barney,
just do your thing. No pressure.

17:57.009 --> 17:58.445
Here's a picture of my sister

17:58.478 --> 18:00.480
in the movie
Silver Linings Playbook.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.081
-Take a look.
-(burps)

18:02.115 --> 18:04.451
Hey, you guys liquored him up!

18:04.484 --> 18:08.255
Don't worry, Moe, I can still
win the spelling bee.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.822
"Recidivism."

18:09.856 --> 18:12.091
"R"... um...

18:12.125 --> 18:14.327
Eh, because of
this idiot, Homer,

18:14.361 --> 18:15.962
we need three strikes from you.

18:15.995 --> 18:18.331
I just want to know what
it's like to be a winner, huh?

18:18.365 --> 18:19.599
Just one time.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.568
What about that
Women in Film award?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.736
-No, I stole that.
-(others gasp)

18:23.770 --> 18:26.706
Okay, Moe, for you, I'll do it.

18:31.144 --> 18:34.046
We're gonna win. I'm not gonna
have to start over again!

18:36.683 --> 18:39.619
Because starting over, uh,
what would that even mean?

18:39.652 --> 18:41.654
("La Vie en rose" playing)

18:46.893 --> 18:48.261
(ship horn blows)

18:48.295 --> 18:50.163

18:58.971 --> 19:00.039
That could be my reality.

19:00.072 --> 19:02.275
Oh, my God,
I got to lose this match.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.710
Homer, no!

19:03.743 --> 19:06.112
-Give me the ball!
-I need it to bowl!

19:06.145 --> 19:07.714
I don't want to win!

19:07.747 --> 19:09.516
You're the worst coach ever!

19:09.549 --> 19:11.251
-(grunting)
-Just give me the damn ball!

19:21.928 --> 19:23.129
(cheering)

19:23.162 --> 19:24.531
What's wrong, Moe?

19:24.564 --> 19:27.066
-Yeah, we won.
-Nothing. I just got to go back

19:27.099 --> 19:29.302
to the worst thing
in the world, huh?

19:29.336 --> 19:31.504
Being me.
(sighs heavily)

19:31.538 --> 19:34.841
The guy you wouldn't even invite
to a basketball game.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.412
Wha... uh,
d-did somebody say "wait"?

19:39.446 --> 19:41.714
-OTHERS: No.
-Well, I wouldn't come back now

19:41.748 --> 19:43.316
if you begged me.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.151
-LENNY: Wait!
-Yeah?

19:45.184 --> 19:46.586
Just making a point.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.759
Surprise!

19:52.792 --> 19:54.427
You guys are my friends.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.996
-That's right.
-We sure are.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.031
And we're gonna have
a big party!

19:59.065 --> 20:01.901
Right after we get back
from the basketball game.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.139
Eh, salt of the earth there.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.045
All right, guys,
since we won the championship,

20:13.079 --> 20:14.914
those hedge fund do-rags
have to deliver

20:14.947 --> 20:18.551
an experience for me and my pals
that only they can bring.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.119
When does it start?

20:20.152 --> 20:22.655
Right about... now.
