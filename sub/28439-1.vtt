00:34.121 --> 00:35.755
What is everybody
makin' such a big thing for?

00:35.757 --> 00:37.857
You'd think the
tomato was a queen.

00:37.859 --> 00:40.225
As far as you're
concerned, she is.

00:40.227 --> 00:42.361
Trouble, I can give it to you.

00:51.973 --> 00:53.839
It was hard enough to
get a good job in this town,

00:53.841 --> 00:56.177
and I don't want to lose it.

01:02.717 --> 01:03.949
You know
all about the fishes,

01:03.951 --> 01:06.351
'cause you're at
home in the slime.

01:06.353 --> 01:07.587
You've put your finger
on all the bodies

01:07.589 --> 01:10.958
that have been buried,
but you won't tell.

01:13.328 --> 01:15.028
Guess I'm
not supposed to ask you

01:15.030 --> 01:16.129
if you've been following me.

01:16.131 --> 01:16.932
Why?
No.

01:18.500 --> 01:21.904
But I suppose
it was all right.

01:25.974 --> 01:27.473
Wouldn't you say
that gives you control

01:27.475 --> 01:29.375
of these bookies?

01:29.377 --> 01:30.911
No, I wouldn't.

01:30.913 --> 01:32.613
That's what they like to say
about me, czar of the bookies,

01:32.615 --> 01:34.280
that's nonsense, it isn't true.

01:34.282 --> 01:37.219
I lend money just
like a bank does.

01:41.289 --> 01:45.258
You can forget this
guy, we can get Ackerman.

01:45.260 --> 01:47.994
We will,
we've got Conelly.

01:47.996 --> 01:49.562
Don't talk, Jerry.

01:49.564 --> 01:53.235
Oh Jerry.

02:38.815 --> 02:41.348
Call.

02:41.350 --> 02:43.753
You sure you wanna do that?

02:48.558 --> 02:49.393
All in.

02:53.630 --> 02:56.701
Alright.

02:58.468 --> 03:00.805
This just got interesting.

03:05.776 --> 03:06.877
Full house.

03:07.745 --> 03:08.979
Aces over twos.

03:15.085 --> 03:15.920
Oh my god.

03:17.755 --> 03:19.254
Sorry Danny.

03:19.256 --> 03:21.123
That sucks.

03:21.125 --> 03:22.192
Wait, what?

03:24.461 --> 03:25.761
What are the odds?

03:25.763 --> 03:27.662
What are the odds
you'd deal quads?

03:27.664 --> 03:30.432
What, you think I don't
know this game is rigged?

03:30.434 --> 03:31.900
What's your cut?

03:31.902 --> 03:33.168
Huh?
No one forced you to play.

03:33.170 --> 03:34.436
Yeah, great job
dealer, great job.

03:34.438 --> 03:35.805
That's on you.

03:35.807 --> 03:37.406
No one forced you to
play tonight Danny.

03:37.408 --> 03:38.607
That's on you.

03:38.609 --> 03:39.542
Come on man, take it easy.

03:39.544 --> 03:40.777
Grab your coat.

03:40.779 --> 03:42.111
Yeah I can walk
my own self out.

03:42.113 --> 03:44.413
Hey what's your problem?

03:44.415 --> 03:45.782
Hope you feel good
about yourselves.

03:45.784 --> 03:47.616
That's my niece's tuition.

03:47.618 --> 03:49.185
Just walk it off Danny.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.187
Walk it
off, walk this off.

03:51.189 --> 03:52.023
Yeah.

04:16.447 --> 04:19.684
Get up Bella, you
have deadlines to meet.

04:26.993 --> 04:29.493
We're live on the scene
with Daniel Collins.

04:29.495 --> 04:32.398
Sir, are you having
a good morning?

04:35.367 --> 04:36.202
Well?

04:38.704 --> 04:39.705
Well what?

04:40.739 --> 04:42.408
You don't have it?

04:43.876 --> 04:47.144
Bell I'm trying to enjoy my
breakfast so can't this wait?

04:47.146 --> 04:50.080
I need to get this in before
the deadline, Uncle Danny.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.984
This is more important.

04:57.857 --> 05:00.858
I'm sorry Bella,
I don't have it.

05:00.860 --> 05:02.192
What?

05:02.194 --> 05:03.293
None of it?

05:03.295 --> 05:05.631
No, I promise I'll get it.

05:07.499 --> 05:08.899
Are you serious?

05:08.901 --> 05:10.500
I can't believe you.

05:10.502 --> 05:12.437
And take a shower
for God's sake.

05:12.439 --> 05:15.042
You reek of liquor and all ins.

05:34.494 --> 05:36.461
What's up Bella?

05:36.463 --> 05:37.963
Where you going pretty lady?

05:37.965 --> 05:40.598
Juanito, give me
my hat and move.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.067
What was that?

05:42.069 --> 05:45.070
You should be lucky
I'm even trying to talk to you.

05:45.072 --> 05:46.204
I don't like you.

05:46.206 --> 05:47.738
Stick to your
business with my uncle

05:47.740 --> 05:49.040
and leave me alone.

05:50.477 --> 05:51.311
Alright.

05:55.382 --> 05:57.482
Tell your uncle he
can't run forever.

05:57.484 --> 05:58.583
I want my money.

05:58.585 --> 05:59.753
Get in line.

06:01.455 --> 06:03.791
See you later Bella.

06:10.899 --> 06:12.698
Damn girl, don't
you know how to knock?

06:12.700 --> 06:13.966
What's if I was naked?

06:13.968 --> 06:15.634
There's nothing to see anyway.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.803
Yeah, says you.

06:17.805 --> 06:18.938
Getting ready?

06:18.940 --> 06:20.139
Yeah.

06:20.141 --> 06:24.043
I don't wanna leave
anything to last minute.

06:24.045 --> 06:24.879
Yeah.

06:29.117 --> 06:30.716
What's the matter?

06:30.718 --> 06:33.052
You're really leaving, huh?

06:33.054 --> 06:35.354
Yeah, just Boston.

06:35.356 --> 06:38.190
I'll be back by Thanksgiving,
maybe even Christmas.

06:38.192 --> 06:41.529
Besides, you'll be
busy with school too.

06:43.697 --> 06:45.466
You are going, right?

06:46.534 --> 06:48.201
Doesn't look like it.

06:48.203 --> 06:50.737
My uncle doesn't have the money.

06:50.739 --> 06:51.972
What?

06:51.974 --> 06:54.241
I thought he was
saving it for you.

06:54.243 --> 06:57.777
I shoulda never
trusted him with it.

06:57.779 --> 06:58.948
Why did you?

07:00.849 --> 07:03.350
Well, I only had
half the money.

07:03.352 --> 07:05.018
And he said he knew a way

07:05.020 --> 07:06.519
that he could double
it in one night.

07:06.521 --> 07:07.689
So I said yes.

07:08.857 --> 07:10.123
He was so sure he
could score with it

07:10.125 --> 07:11.693
and I believed him.

07:12.827 --> 07:14.962
Bella I'm so sorry.

07:14.964 --> 07:16.196
Is there anything I can do?

07:16.198 --> 07:18.133
Don't worry about it.

07:19.534 --> 07:21.468
No, we both said we
were gonna leave together.

07:21.470 --> 07:24.037
I don't wanna see you
stuck here either.

07:24.039 --> 07:27.376
If it's meant to
be then it'll happen.

07:29.244 --> 07:31.178
You're my best friend.

07:31.180 --> 07:33.448
I just want you to be happy.

07:35.217 --> 07:36.684
You're gonna get outta here.

07:36.686 --> 07:41.624
You're gonna see the world
and you're gonna be a writer.

07:42.358 --> 07:43.726
I'm going to miss you.

07:45.996 --> 07:48.064
I'm gonna miss you too.

07:54.237 --> 07:55.336
Hey Deanna.

07:55.338 --> 07:56.270
How are you today?

07:56.272 --> 07:57.107
Hey.

07:58.208 --> 07:59.507
I'm good.

07:59.509 --> 08:01.344
I got your favorite.

08:04.647 --> 08:06.114
I don't have time
for a song today

08:06.116 --> 08:07.915
but you're going to
sing for me, right?

08:07.917 --> 08:09.585
I definitely will.

08:10.453 --> 08:13.554
You just so good to me Bella.

08:13.556 --> 08:14.855
Well I better get inside

08:14.857 --> 08:18.126
before Mr. Cliff comes
out looking for me.

08:18.128 --> 08:19.129
Okay baby.

08:21.931 --> 08:23.064
Hey everybody.

08:23.066 --> 08:24.401
Bella.

08:26.203 --> 08:29.238
Like I said, you know they
gonna win the MPP this year.

08:30.407 --> 08:31.806
Hey man let me tell you,

08:31.808 --> 08:34.143
me and this dude go back
further than the Bronx airline.

08:43.919 --> 08:45.487
Bella, Bella
you're killing me.

08:45.489 --> 08:47.622
Why do you keep giving that
woman reasons to loiter

08:47.624 --> 08:49.058
in front of my shop?

08:49.060 --> 08:49.958
What?

08:49.960 --> 08:51.893
Wow, you see everything.

08:51.895 --> 08:53.962
And she was out there before
I started working here.

08:53.964 --> 08:55.430
Yeah and you know how
many time I've run her off.

08:55.432 --> 08:59.403
Come on, gimme a break
with her already, please.

09:03.740 --> 09:05.240
Yo yo yo Danny.

09:05.242 --> 09:07.276
Hey listen, hey
man when you gonna

09:07.278 --> 09:09.678
pay me back that 50
bucks you owe me?

09:09.680 --> 09:11.346
I don't owe you 50 bucks.

09:11.348 --> 09:12.915
Oh I figured since
you owed everybody else

09:12.917 --> 09:14.184
you probably owed me too.

09:15.087 --> 09:15.920
I got him.

09:18.290 --> 09:19.955
Ya'll seen him do it.

09:19.957 --> 09:21.859
How's everybody know?

09:22.894 --> 09:24.360
Bella say something?

09:24.362 --> 09:26.196
It gets around pretty quick
when you play high stakes

09:26.198 --> 09:28.300
like you were last night.

09:30.202 --> 09:33.371
Cliff, can I talk
to you in private?

09:37.375 --> 09:38.474
Sure.

09:38.476 --> 09:39.377
Come on in.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.552
Hey Bruno.

09:49.554 --> 09:51.354
Hey Bella.

09:51.356 --> 09:52.855
You still read the paper?

09:52.857 --> 09:54.857
You know you can get news
on your phone nowadays.

09:54.859 --> 09:57.793
Call me a
dinosaur, but I love the way

09:57.795 --> 10:00.231
a newspaper feels
on my fingertips.

10:00.233 --> 10:03.066
Plus, less radiation
going through my veins.

10:03.068 --> 10:07.173
Well if you say so.

10:12.511 --> 10:14.178
Take care of her
this time, huh?

10:14.180 --> 10:14.980
Yeah.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.452
I'd like to talk to Cliff.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.519
Can I go in?

10:22.521 --> 10:23.922
Sure, go ahead.

10:30.429 --> 10:32.028
Hi Cliff.

10:32.030 --> 10:32.896
Can I come in?

10:32.898 --> 10:34.531
Sure, yeah.

10:34.533 --> 10:35.368
Thanks.

10:36.335 --> 10:37.503
Have a seat.

10:40.606 --> 10:43.440
So, what can I help you with?

10:43.442 --> 10:45.642
Why was my uncle here?

10:45.644 --> 10:49.481
Bella I, I hear that
you're having money problems.

10:49.483 --> 10:52.250
Uncle Danny said I
had money problems?

10:52.252 --> 10:53.851
He's the one with
money problems.

10:53.853 --> 10:56.354
He was supposed to be
saving my money for school.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.855
Ask him where that's at.

10:57.857 --> 11:02.294
Oh right, you can't because
he doesn't have any of it.

11:02.296 --> 11:03.863
Bella, stay calm.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.833
Did he tell you
where the money went?

11:08.835 --> 11:10.468
Or does he owe you too?

11:10.470 --> 11:11.736
No.

11:11.738 --> 11:14.408
He came here for something else.

11:16.210 --> 11:17.411
Something else.

11:20.747 --> 11:24.984
Now look, I think I can
help you with your problem.

11:26.220 --> 11:29.254
I know someone who works
over at the university.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.890
She owes me a favor.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.300
Will you call her?

11:40.435 --> 11:42.503
Yes Cliff, I sure will.

11:45.606 --> 11:46.541
Call her!

11:55.950 --> 11:56.784
Bella.

11:58.118 --> 11:58.953
Hey.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.521
Bell!

12:02.523 --> 12:03.791
Dinner's ready.

12:39.395 --> 12:40.627
Yes I'll send you

12:40.629 --> 12:43.297
a list of potential
students by tomorrow.

12:43.299 --> 12:45.932
Mrs. Mackie, your
9:00 o'clock is here.

12:45.934 --> 12:49.002
Will do, thanks.

12:49.004 --> 12:50.437
Bella, right?

12:50.439 --> 12:51.405
Yes ma'am.

12:51.407 --> 12:52.574
Have a seat.

12:55.043 --> 12:57.877
So Clifford says you wanna
try and get into school?

12:57.879 --> 12:59.646
Yes ma'am.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.214
You're gonna have to say a
little more than yes ma'am.

13:01.216 --> 13:02.482
I have to know how to help you.

13:02.484 --> 13:03.950
You want some water?

13:03.952 --> 13:05.285
Yes ma'am.

13:05.287 --> 13:07.253
Yes, I would like some water.

13:07.255 --> 13:09.489
Shari a couple waters please.

13:09.491 --> 13:12.092
Look, if Danny's not in the
house, we leave a message.

13:12.094 --> 13:12.927
Not home.

13:12.929 --> 13:13.763
Done.

13:18.701 --> 13:20.935
So tell
me about yourself

13:20.937 --> 13:22.603
and your desired major.

13:22.605 --> 13:24.138
Journalism, actually.

14:30.708 --> 14:33.675
- Anything?
- I got nothing.

14:33.677 --> 14:35.345
Nothing here boss.

14:37.448 --> 14:39.481
You will be eligible
for all those scholarships

14:39.483 --> 14:41.450
that we talked about.

14:41.452 --> 14:44.019
Just gather the documents
requested, get 'em back to me

14:44.021 --> 14:45.220
and I'll help you
fill out the rest.

14:45.222 --> 14:47.323
Thank you so much Mrs. Mackie.

14:47.325 --> 14:48.591
My pleasure.

14:48.593 --> 14:50.693
You should be able to
enroll by next semester.

14:50.695 --> 14:53.062
I can't thank you enough.

14:53.064 --> 14:53.898
Thank you.

15:33.371 --> 15:35.004
Bella can we talk?

15:35.006 --> 15:36.239
I'm getting dressed.

15:36.241 --> 15:39.512
Besides, there's
nothing to talk about.

15:40.513 --> 15:41.679
Yesterday, I...

15:41.681 --> 15:42.880
Save it.

15:42.882 --> 15:44.381
I'm handling it.

15:44.383 --> 15:45.315
I don't need you anymore.

15:45.317 --> 15:46.886
Now leave me alone.

16:38.572 --> 16:39.538
Bella!

16:47.514 --> 16:49.848
Where are you going?

16:49.850 --> 16:51.816
What are you wearing?

16:51.818 --> 16:52.884
I know.

16:52.886 --> 16:55.286
I feel really awkward.

16:55.288 --> 16:57.057
So you don't like it?

16:58.424 --> 17:01.325
It's just I've never
seen you in a dress before.

17:01.327 --> 17:03.595
And without your hat.

17:03.597 --> 17:05.598
Well, that says a lot.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.200
What do you want me to say?

17:09.202 --> 17:10.801
That maybe I look
as pretty as that girl

17:10.804 --> 17:13.204
that you were dancing with.

17:13.207 --> 17:14.040
Better.

17:15.309 --> 17:18.277
Where is this coming from?

17:18.279 --> 17:19.280
Nevermind.

17:21.648 --> 17:24.950
When did you start caring
about the girls you see me with?

17:24.952 --> 17:25.885
Nevermind.

17:25.887 --> 17:27.319
Forget I said anything.

17:27.320 --> 17:29.054
Go enjoy your party.

17:29.056 --> 17:30.389
Bella!

17:30.391 --> 17:31.225
Bella!

17:41.102 --> 17:43.235
Uncle Danny I'm home.

17:44.706 --> 17:45.738
Uncle Danny?

17:45.740 --> 17:47.272
Uncle Danny!

17:47.274 --> 17:48.307
Oh my god are you okay?

17:48.309 --> 17:49.476
What happened?

17:50.377 --> 17:51.278
Hey Bell.

17:53.380 --> 17:55.049
No, no, no no no no.

17:55.917 --> 17:57.418
Shh, shh, no cops.

17:58.285 --> 17:59.119
You are hurt.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.153
You need an ambulance.

18:00.155 --> 18:02.257
No, no I'm not.

18:03.358 --> 18:04.490
I can't.

18:04.492 --> 18:06.361
I gotta get help.
No, no.

18:16.772 --> 18:17.704
Hello.

18:17.706 --> 18:18.538
Cliff.

18:18.540 --> 18:19.372
Yeah.

18:19.374 --> 18:21.174
Uncle Danny's hurt.

18:21.176 --> 18:22.876
He's on the ground.

18:22.878 --> 18:25.545
He's at our house,
somebody attacked him.

18:25.547 --> 18:26.479
What?

18:26.481 --> 18:27.681
He's on the ground.

18:27.683 --> 18:28.682
Who did this?

18:28.684 --> 18:30.617
I don't know who did it.

18:30.619 --> 18:32.252
Alright, alright, just relax.

18:32.254 --> 18:33.486
I'll be right over.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.055
I'll be right over.

18:35.057 --> 18:37.257
Okay, come quick.

18:37.259 --> 18:38.524
I'll be here.

18:38.526 --> 18:40.493
Bruno, we have a situation.

18:40.495 --> 18:42.863
I need you to pick me up,
drop me off at Bella's

18:42.865 --> 18:44.665
and then head over to Juanito's.

18:44.667 --> 18:48.569
And make sure that they know
that Danny's debt is canceled.

18:48.571 --> 18:50.171
Yeah.

18:50.173 --> 18:53.274
Yeah, this generation needs
to learn some respect.

18:53.276 --> 18:54.110
Son of a.

19:17.333 --> 19:18.334
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:27.310 --> 19:28.644
So, how is he?

19:30.413 --> 19:32.847
They really beat him badly.

19:32.849 --> 19:35.352
Mr. Cliff's upstairs with him.

19:37.321 --> 19:39.822
Bella I'm so sorry.

19:39.824 --> 19:41.890
Is there anything I can do?

19:41.892 --> 19:43.291
No.

19:43.293 --> 19:44.693
I just feel really bad

19:44.695 --> 19:48.731
by the way I've been
treating Uncle Danny lately.

19:48.733 --> 19:51.867
I said a lotta
things I didn't mean.

19:51.869 --> 19:53.568
I'm sure he understands.

19:53.570 --> 19:55.570
He loves you too much.

19:55.572 --> 19:57.672
Besides you can't feel bad

19:57.674 --> 20:00.809
for what he gets
himself involved in.

20:00.811 --> 20:01.645
I guess.

20:03.547 --> 20:05.382
So, how was the party?

20:07.184 --> 20:10.819
It would've been
better if you stayed.

20:10.821 --> 20:12.289
Bell, are we okay?

20:13.590 --> 20:15.357
Yeah, no worries.

20:15.359 --> 20:17.392
I was just having a moment.

20:17.394 --> 20:18.195
Bell?

20:19.129 --> 20:20.097
Are we good?

20:21.265 --> 20:22.066
Yes.

20:33.511 --> 20:35.344
Do you want something to drink?

20:35.346 --> 20:36.181
No.

20:39.918 --> 20:42.487
Why are you weirding out on me?

20:44.823 --> 20:46.057
I don't know.

20:47.158 --> 20:50.393
I just feel like things
are falling apart.

20:50.395 --> 20:53.062
I guess I don't want
you to leave me.

20:53.064 --> 20:54.931
I'm not gonna leave you.

20:54.933 --> 20:58.436
I'm a phone call and
a 10 hour drive away.

20:59.570 --> 21:02.171
Things are getting
dangerous here.

21:02.173 --> 21:03.508
I just wanna go.

21:05.076 --> 21:08.111
They could've killed
my uncle tonight.

21:08.113 --> 21:09.881
It's gonna be okay.

21:11.050 --> 21:13.583
Now listen, it's okay.

21:20.827 --> 21:22.226
I need you to go pick up
that package on 18th Street.

21:24.130 --> 21:25.264
Go get that.

21:55.727 --> 21:58.028
Where do you
think you're going?

22:02.369 --> 22:04.069
How much does Danny owe you?

22:05.605 --> 22:07.205
How much?

22:07.207 --> 22:08.539
Nothing.

22:08.541 --> 22:12.143
Please,
make me come back.

22:27.427 --> 22:29.260
Mrs. Mackie.

22:29.262 --> 22:31.062
Hey Bella, I'm
just checking in.

22:31.064 --> 22:32.330
I haven't heard from
you in a couple of days.

22:32.332 --> 22:33.631
Everything alright?

22:33.633 --> 22:35.566
I'm sorry, I've been
taking care of my uncle.

22:35.568 --> 22:37.102
He was in an accident.

22:37.104 --> 22:39.337
Oh wow, I'm
sorry to hear that.

22:39.339 --> 22:40.273
Is he okay?

22:41.208 --> 22:43.008
Yes ma'am, he's doing better.

22:43.010 --> 22:44.775
Okay well you still
wanna come to school

22:44.777 --> 22:46.177
this next semester, right?

22:46.179 --> 22:48.514
Yes, I filled out
most of the paperwork.

22:48.516 --> 22:50.182
Have I missed the deadline?

22:50.184 --> 22:53.185
Oh no you have a week
to get those forms to me.

22:53.187 --> 22:54.987
Well I'll be in today.

22:54.989 --> 22:56.824
Great, see you soon.

23:01.429 --> 23:03.162
Are you going to
be okay Uncle Danny?

23:03.164 --> 23:04.430
Where you going?

23:04.432 --> 23:06.532
Gotta meet with
Mrs. Mackie today.

23:06.534 --> 23:07.699
Okay, good.

23:07.701 --> 23:09.635
Don't you worry about me.

23:09.637 --> 23:11.537
See you after work.

23:11.539 --> 23:12.871
I'll see ya.

23:12.873 --> 23:14.873
You be safe, okay?

24:45.668 --> 24:46.834
Oh my gosh.

24:46.836 --> 24:48.302
Give me water.

24:48.304 --> 24:49.903
I just ran all the way
here from the bus station.

24:49.905 --> 24:52.206
You forgot I
was leaving today.

24:52.208 --> 24:53.407
No way.

24:53.409 --> 24:56.244
Tell me the truth
and I'll give you life.

24:56.246 --> 24:57.980
Cruel, cruel beast.

24:59.682 --> 25:01.615
I'm a terrible friend.

25:01.617 --> 25:03.551
Actually the lady
I told you about

25:03.553 --> 25:05.086
that's helping me
get into school,

25:05.088 --> 25:07.655
she called me this morning
to finish up my paperwork.

25:07.657 --> 25:09.357
I rushed out of the house

25:09.359 --> 25:11.526
and I forgot I was supposed
to be here to see you off.

25:11.528 --> 25:12.994
Sorry.

25:12.996 --> 25:15.166
Truly a terrible friend.

25:19.536 --> 25:21.836
Hey, I ran all the way
here from the bus station.

25:21.838 --> 25:24.206
This has got to
count for something.

25:24.208 --> 25:26.741
What do you want, a medal?

25:26.743 --> 25:28.810
I deserve something.

25:28.812 --> 25:31.346
How about an interview?

25:31.348 --> 25:33.882
So Chad, tell me,
how does it feel

25:33.884 --> 25:37.319
to leave the home for the first
time in your wonderful life?

25:37.321 --> 25:40.755
Well, I feel so
bubbly I might explode!

25:51.335 --> 25:53.604
The world awaits you sir.

25:55.072 --> 25:56.171
I wish you the best.

25:56.173 --> 25:58.440
You promise you won't forget me?

25:58.442 --> 25:59.611
Never silly.

26:03.014 --> 26:04.680
I'll call you on the way there

26:04.682 --> 26:06.482
and we're definitely hanging
out for Thanksgiving.

26:06.484 --> 26:07.319
Okay?

26:20.698 --> 26:21.533
Later.

26:41.386 --> 26:42.318
Ugh, I know.

26:42.320 --> 26:44.354
It's so much to fill out.

26:44.356 --> 26:46.823
Yeah, I've signed my
name over 100 times.

26:49.027 --> 26:50.794
Oh, it's time for my lunch.

26:50.796 --> 26:52.229
Wanna join me?

26:52.231 --> 26:53.564
No, but thanks.

26:53.566 --> 26:54.498
I can eat later.

26:54.500 --> 26:55.766
I won't take no for an answer.

26:55.768 --> 26:56.600
Come on.

26:56.602 --> 26:57.436
Let's go.

27:02.675 --> 27:04.508
So journalism, huh?

27:04.510 --> 27:05.709
Yeah.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.411
When I was a little
girl I loved film noir.

27:07.413 --> 27:09.480
My favorite was
Behind Green Lights.

27:09.482 --> 27:12.249
My mother used to
love those films.

27:12.251 --> 27:13.684
Really?

27:13.686 --> 27:17.221
I don't meet too many
people that like film noir.

27:17.223 --> 27:19.290
My favorite parts
were when the press

27:19.292 --> 27:21.358
always got the
first information,

27:21.360 --> 27:24.528
then the detectives, they
would corner the murderer.

27:24.530 --> 27:26.997
Which most of the
time beautiful women.

27:26.999 --> 27:30.667
Look at you, you're such
an interesting film buff.

27:30.669 --> 27:32.135
Are you sure you don't
wanna be a film maker?

27:32.137 --> 27:33.604
I bet you'd be a good one.

27:33.606 --> 27:35.740
No, I like being in the time,

27:35.742 --> 27:38.976
smack in the middle of it when
all of the action goes down.

27:38.978 --> 27:40.814
Up close and personal.

27:45.952 --> 27:47.552
Where you going?

27:47.554 --> 27:49.086
I have to get to work.

27:49.088 --> 27:51.088
Do you know how to get
to the bus from here?

27:51.090 --> 27:52.257
Oh I can take you.

27:52.259 --> 27:53.891
No, that's okay.

27:53.893 --> 27:55.295
Thanks for lunch.

28:01.568 --> 28:02.567
Hey Deanna.

28:02.569 --> 28:04.135
Ready to sing a song for me?

28:04.137 --> 28:05.071
I need one.

28:06.206 --> 28:07.274
What's wrong?

28:08.208 --> 28:10.775
They treat me so bad.

28:10.777 --> 28:13.711
But I keep coming
back looking for you.

28:13.713 --> 28:14.946
I'm so sorry.

28:14.948 --> 28:17.014
I'll talk to them.

28:17.016 --> 28:20.418
Oh wow, I forgot
your sandwich too.

28:20.420 --> 28:22.186
Don't worry about it baby.

28:22.188 --> 28:24.990
You know, I owe you this

31:57.442 --> 31:58.908
Thanks.

31:58.910 --> 32:01.846
Why don't you
get inside already?

32:05.249 --> 32:08.217
Oh Cliff does

32:10.021 --> 32:10.853
Come on guys.

That's enough.

32:20.098 --> 32:21.363
Hi babe.

32:22.668 --> 32:24.067

32:24.069 --> 32:25.368
I mean she knows
exactly what she wants.

32:25.370 --> 32:26.604
She's determined.

32:26.606 --> 32:27.571
I love it.

32:27.573 --> 32:28.839
She sounds just like you.

32:28.841 --> 32:30.107
- Aw.

32:30.109 --> 32:31.074

32:31.076 --> 32:32.375

- I'm sorry.

32:32.377 --> 32:33.145
I'm sorry.

32:35.548 --> 32:36.647
How was your day?

32:36.649 --> 32:37.848
Oh one more of those

32:37.850 --> 32:39.049

answer that question.

32:39.051 --> 32:40.183
Oh, you're sweet.

32:40.185 --> 32:41.218
Watch it, it's hot.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.452
Oh okay.

32:42.454 --> 32:43.987
Though not as hot
as you, but you know.

32:43.989 --> 32:44.855
Oh okay.

32:44.857 --> 32:45.956
That's enough.
No?

32:45.958 --> 32:46.890
- Alright loverboy.
- No, no.

32:46.892 --> 32:47.858
Come on, come on, come on.

32:47.860 --> 32:48.792
I gotta get to work.

32:48.794 --> 32:50.227
I miss you, I miss you.

32:50.229 --> 32:51.394
I miss you too.

32:51.396 --> 32:52.329
Alright.

32:52.331 --> 32:53.363
I know you got painting to do.

32:53.365 --> 32:54.331
And I gotta do this.

32:54.333 --> 32:55.799
- Alright.
- Okay.

32:55.801 --> 32:56.967
Holla if you need me.

32:56.969 --> 32:57.803
Alright.

33:03.208 --> 33:04.575
Hi officers,

33:04.577 --> 33:06.143
Yeah, I'm just

33:06.145 --> 33:07.310
I got

33:07.312 --> 33:10.381
- Cool man, thanks.
- Alright.

33:10.383 --> 33:11.349
How you doing?

33:11.351 --> 33:12.653
- Good.
- Alright.

33:16.523 --> 33:17.989
What's wrong Kittie?

33:17.991 --> 33:19.924
What's wrong
man, I mean you look like

33:19.926 --> 33:21.192
you got a warrant or
something like that.

33:22.295 --> 33:23.528
Cocaine in your pocket?

33:23.530 --> 33:25.664
Well here's the
good thing officer,

33:25.666 --> 33:27.966
you know he didn't steal them
clothes, 'cause they're ugly.

33:29.135 --> 33:30.434
And cheap.

33:30.436 --> 33:31.237
Oh man.

33:39.112 --> 33:39.946
Um, god.

33:41.815 --> 33:43.047
Whoo they getting
finer and finer

33:43.049 --> 33:46.084
every time they come in here.

33:46.086 --> 33:47.218
Meet Cliff for an hour.

33:47.220 --> 33:48.553
Shoot, give me a day.

33:48.555 --> 33:49.721
'Cause what I'm trying to do

33:49.723 --> 33:51.089
gonna take way
longer than a hour.

33:53.326 --> 33:54.458
That old dude
can't handle that.

33:54.460 --> 33:55.293
Let me go help him.

33:55.295 --> 33:56.460
Man, go get 'em them.

33:56.462 --> 33:57.562
Yeah, your wife's
on the phone.

33:57.564 --> 33:58.397
Oh you know what?

33:58.399 --> 33:59.231
I'ma cut his hair first.

34:00.167 --> 34:02.201
Then I'll go see him.

34:21.288 --> 34:25.123
Marco, let's watch
a movie tonight.

34:25.126 --> 34:26.324
No, don't
move, don't move.

34:26.327 --> 34:27.226
Just like that, please.

34:27.228 --> 34:29.063
Let's watch a movie.

34:36.170 --> 34:37.670
Okay, that works,

34:37.672 --> 34:40.272
but then we're gonna have
to start all over again.

34:40.274 --> 34:43.007
Just put the paint brush down.

34:43.010 --> 34:46.411
Don't you wonder
what kinda movie?

34:46.414 --> 34:47.683
Whoo.

34:51.754 --> 34:52.587
Oh baby.

34:54.322 --> 34:55.789
A film noir.

34:55.791 --> 34:57.423
Have you ever seen a film noir?

34:57.425 --> 34:58.558
- They're amazing.
- Really?

34:58.560 --> 34:59.492
We're gonna watch one.

34:59.494 --> 35:00.426
I'll give you a film noir.

35:00.428 --> 35:01.962
No, that's not.

35:03.165 --> 35:04.264
I'll give you film noir.

35:04.266 --> 35:05.866
I'll give you film noir.

36:35.192 --> 36:36.124
Hello?

36:36.126 --> 36:37.692
Is this Danny Collins?

36:37.694 --> 36:38.794
Yes.

36:38.796 --> 36:40.195
Who's this?

36:40.197 --> 36:41.897
I'm calling from
Whitmore Presbyterian Hospital.

36:41.899 --> 36:44.532
I have you down as the
contact for Kim Worson.

36:44.534 --> 36:46.703
Yes, is everything okay?

36:47.872 --> 36:50.672
Sir, you need
to come to the hospital.

36:50.674 --> 36:51.506
What's wrong?

36:51.508 --> 36:52.941
Is Kim okay?

36:52.943 --> 36:54.743
Sir, we cannot
discuss this over the phone.

36:54.745 --> 36:57.145
Can you please just
tell me what's going on?

36:57.147 --> 36:59.483
- Sir.
- Okay, I'm on my way.

37:01.651 --> 37:02.851
Cliff.

37:02.853 --> 37:03.886
Mrs. Mackie?

37:03.888 --> 37:05.055
Where is he?

37:19.737 --> 37:21.672
Why didn't you tell me?

37:24.142 --> 37:26.542
It was all in due time.

37:26.544 --> 37:28.144
I guess the time has come.

37:28.146 --> 37:31.316
But why would you
do this to me now?

37:33.451 --> 37:36.454
Look, it's time
for you make right

37:37.555 --> 37:39.557
and pay your past debts.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.433
I can't do this.

37:53.638 --> 37:55.604
Wait a
minute, wait a minute.

37:55.606 --> 37:56.607
Is that Kim?

37:59.345 --> 38:00.577
That looks like her.

38:00.579 --> 38:03.482
What is she doing
all by herself?

38:06.718 --> 38:09.321
I don't know, let's find out.

38:17.830 --> 38:21.233
That's crazy
man, at this hour.

38:24.436 --> 38:26.672
There she is, there she is.

38:27.840 --> 38:31.510
I think that she wanted
to, she disappeared.

38:33.045 --> 38:34.879
Think she went into that alley?

38:34.881 --> 38:36.346
Yeah.

38:36.348 --> 38:37.516
I'll check it.

38:55.768 --> 38:57.335
I swear to god, I swear
to god if you scream

38:57.337 --> 38:58.436
I'm gonna kill you.

38:58.438 --> 38:59.905
I swear to god I'll cut you.

38:59.907 --> 39:02.107
- No, please.
- Shh, shut your mouth.

39:02.109 --> 39:04.109
Turn around, here.

39:04.111 --> 39:06.277
Now turn around.

39:06.279 --> 39:08.181
- No.
- Shut your mouth.

39:16.556 --> 39:17.755
Now.

39:35.109 --> 39:36.608
Hey!

39:36.610 --> 39:41.282
You come at me I'm
a cut her, I swear to god.

39:42.183 --> 39:43.449
Come on.

40:09.343 --> 40:10.811
I can't do this.

40:16.917 --> 40:17.718
Excuse me.

40:25.760 --> 40:29.164
But I guess the
sisters don't like Kim.

40:33.035 --> 40:35.468
Bella mind your business.

40:35.470 --> 40:37.704
Cliff, why did she
come in here like this?

40:37.706 --> 40:39.839
Does this have to do with
my college applications?

40:39.841 --> 40:41.676
What's wrong with her?

40:43.112 --> 40:46.213
Bella I've known
you your whole life.

40:46.215 --> 40:47.414
You're like a daughter to me.

40:47.416 --> 40:48.548
Yes Cliff, I know.

40:48.550 --> 40:50.219
But what's going on?

40:52.487 --> 40:53.822
It's too soon.

40:54.923 --> 40:56.656
What do you mean, "too soon"?

40:56.658 --> 41:00.162
What is it, when are
you going to tell me?

41:01.130 --> 41:02.895
In due time.

41:02.897 --> 41:04.097
In due time.

41:12.875 --> 41:16.077
Hey, hey, hey,
what's wrong honey?

41:16.079 --> 41:17.378
Come here, talk to me baby.

41:17.380 --> 41:18.246
Come here.

41:18.248 --> 41:19.647
What's going on?

41:19.649 --> 41:21.515
Oh my god.

41:21.517 --> 41:23.386
What's wrong?

41:24.654 --> 41:26.254
You promise you
won't judge me?

41:26.256 --> 41:27.088
Of course not,
I'd never do that.

41:27.090 --> 41:28.356
Do you promise?

41:28.358 --> 41:29.357
Of course not,
I'd never do that.

41:29.359 --> 41:30.960
- You promise.
- I promise!

41:34.130 --> 41:34.964
Okay.

41:36.166 --> 41:39.669
When I was 19 I was
at a party with Danny.

41:42.405 --> 41:45.475
And he got caught
up in a poker game.

41:46.942 --> 41:48.176
And he didn't wanna leave

41:48.178 --> 41:51.214
and I was tired so
I left without him.

41:52.382 --> 41:55.218
And this man pulled
me into an alley.

41:56.719 --> 41:59.788
And he put a knife
in my throat and he.

41:59.790 --> 42:02.791
Oh, oh my god, no you don't
have to say another word.

42:02.793 --> 42:04.059
No no, you don't understand.

42:04.061 --> 42:05.129
There's more.

42:07.264 --> 42:08.532
I got pregnant.

42:11.302 --> 42:12.534
I thought about an abortion

42:12.536 --> 42:15.270
but I couldn't go
through with it.

42:15.272 --> 42:16.340
So I had her.

42:17.641 --> 42:19.310
And I gave her away.

42:20.377 --> 42:22.144
You had a little girl?

42:22.146 --> 42:23.745
Yes.

42:23.747 --> 42:25.180
Oh my god.

42:25.182 --> 42:28.817
And I think I've
been meeting with her.

42:28.819 --> 42:30.085
What do you mean?

42:30.087 --> 42:32.921
You know the girl
that I told you about,

42:32.923 --> 42:35.025
the one I've been helping?

42:36.793 --> 42:37.794
Oh my god.

42:39.563 --> 42:40.897
You mean...
Yes.

42:46.638 --> 42:48.438
I don't know what to do.

42:48.440 --> 42:50.973
I don't know what to do.

42:50.975 --> 42:52.308
Okay, okay.

42:52.310 --> 42:56.148
Look, I know you know I
am here for you, okay?

42:57.382 --> 43:00.250
Whatever you need is golden.

43:00.252 --> 43:03.085
But maybe you can give
that little girl a chance.

43:03.087 --> 43:04.587
No.

43:04.589 --> 43:07.257
No, she's better
off not knowing.

43:07.259 --> 43:08.524
Okay, okay, okay.

43:08.526 --> 43:09.859
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

43:09.861 --> 43:10.695
Yeah.

43:11.863 --> 43:15.467
That's it, that's all
I'm gonna say about it.

43:27.111 --> 43:28.311
Director
Mackie's office.

43:28.313 --> 43:29.612
How may I help you?

43:29.614 --> 43:32.448
Hi Shari, this is
Bella Collins again.

43:32.450 --> 43:36.289
I was wondering if Mrs.
Mackie has come in yet.

43:37.656 --> 43:41.292
I'm sorry
Bella, she's in a meeting.

43:41.294 --> 43:43.059
Well I've left
several messages

43:43.061 --> 43:45.664
and she hasn't called back yet.

43:46.965 --> 43:48.232
I'm sorry.

43:48.234 --> 43:50.334
I can transfer you
to her voicemail.

43:50.336 --> 43:52.669
She'll be back with
you as soon as she can.

43:52.671 --> 43:53.906
Okay, thanks.

43:55.107 --> 43:57.443
Okay, please hold.

43:58.711 --> 44:01.812
Hi Mrs. Mackie, this
is Bella Collins again.

44:01.814 --> 44:04.080
I was wondering
when I could come in

44:04.082 --> 44:05.749
to help finish my paperwork.

44:05.751 --> 44:07.518
The deadline's tomorrow.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.220
Call me when you
get this message.

44:09.222 --> 44:10.120
Thank you.

44:10.122 --> 44:10.956
Bye.

44:22.001 --> 44:22.836
Bell.

44:23.737 --> 44:25.339
Breakfast is ready.

44:27.507 --> 44:28.706
Bella!

44:28.708 --> 44:31.276
Stop yelling,
I'm right here.

44:31.278 --> 44:33.545
Come on, I don't
like cold pancakes.

44:33.547 --> 44:35.215
Sit down, let's eat.

44:38.852 --> 44:40.454
What, no interview?

44:42.055 --> 44:46.524
Hey, we're doing a story on
Danny's Bistro and cuisines.

44:46.526 --> 44:49.727
And we have some very
satisfyied customers here

44:49.729 --> 44:52.364
who'd like to share their
experience with you.

44:52.366 --> 44:56.536
Ma'am, what do you think
of la pancake a la carte?

44:59.072 --> 45:01.072
There seems to be
some sort of problem.

45:01.074 --> 45:03.241
Is everything okay?

45:03.243 --> 45:04.411
No, nothing.

45:06.212 --> 45:07.046
Okay.

45:09.750 --> 45:10.983
Is everything working out

45:10.985 --> 45:13.018
with that break you
caught at school?

45:13.020 --> 45:14.253
I don't know.

45:14.255 --> 45:16.489
That lady never
returns my calls.

45:16.491 --> 45:18.857
The deadline's tomorrow.

45:18.859 --> 45:19.694
Oh yeah.

45:21.429 --> 45:23.462
Okay look, you just eat up.

45:23.464 --> 45:25.498
Everything's gonna
work out just fine.

45:25.500 --> 45:27.300
How can you be so sure?

45:27.302 --> 45:31.404
You just eat your
la pancake a la carte.

45:31.406 --> 45:33.408
I'll figure out the rest.

45:36.477 --> 45:37.645
Go on, eat up.

45:42.783 --> 45:44.184
Come on, come on.

45:49.557 --> 45:51.459
Yes Shari, I'll hold.

45:53.628 --> 45:55.494
Hey Bella, anybody available?

45:55.496 --> 45:57.162
Tony in about five minutes.

45:57.164 --> 45:57.997
Okay cool.

45:57.999 --> 45:59.165
Can I help you?

45:59.167 --> 46:00.400
Yeah I know
you're pretty busy,

46:00.402 --> 46:01.335
but do you think you
could fit us in today?

46:01.337 --> 46:02.404
Yeah, sure.

46:03.539 --> 46:06.039
And if you don't mind,
while we're waiting,

46:06.041 --> 46:07.841
she has to go to the bathroom.

46:07.843 --> 46:09.809
Could you take her?

46:09.811 --> 46:12.981
- Hello princess.
- Alright sweetheart.

46:20.522 --> 46:21.988
Are you leaving soon?

46:21.990 --> 46:23.923
Yeah I have that
flight to Illinois.

46:23.925 --> 46:26.094
I haven't even packed yet.

46:27.228 --> 46:31.230
Bella Collins is
holding on line three.

46:32.901 --> 46:34.603
I'll call her back.

46:37.005 --> 46:38.204
You can say all
the junk you want

46:38.206 --> 46:40.206
about that pound for
pound but if Mayweather

46:40.208 --> 46:41.675
got in the ring
with Muhammad Ali,

46:41.677 --> 46:43.910
he'd get every pound
of that butt whooped.

46:43.912 --> 46:45.980
Man it's all
about the money too man.

46:45.982 --> 46:47.247
- Yeah.
- Hey.

46:47.249 --> 46:48.849
It's gonna take money
to pay the doctor bill.

46:48.851 --> 46:49.884
That's what it would do.

46:49.886 --> 46:50.951
Numbers don't lie.

46:50.953 --> 46:52.487
49 and oh.

46:52.489 --> 46:53.688
Yeah that's 'cause
Ali wasn't in there.

46:53.690 --> 46:55.358
Hey Bella, you okay?

46:56.859 --> 46:57.692
What's wrong with you?

46:57.694 --> 46:58.626
You alright?

46:58.628 --> 46:59.694
I'm sorry, what do you need?

46:59.696 --> 47:01.529
I'm about to go on my break.

47:01.531 --> 47:02.463
Check my 3:00.

47:02.465 --> 47:03.898
My 3:00 cancel?

47:03.900 --> 47:06.233
No, I need to leave
for a little bit.

47:06.235 --> 47:07.568
Will you cover the front for me?

47:07.570 --> 47:08.905
I'll tell Cliff.

47:09.772 --> 47:10.571
Yeah, no problem sweetie.

47:10.573 --> 47:11.406
Go ahead.

47:11.408 --> 47:12.640
Think he's out back.

47:12.642 --> 47:14.141
Bella been
acting weird today.

47:14.143 --> 47:15.776
Yeah, don't worry about Bella.

47:15.778 --> 47:17.445
You need to worry
about Mayweather.

47:17.447 --> 47:19.714
But listen don't get it wrong,
I like Mayweather too now.

47:19.716 --> 47:22.550
You would never
bet your money against Ali.

47:22.552 --> 47:25.622
It's not a
bad weird anyways.

48:01.892 --> 48:02.726
Next.

48:08.899 --> 48:10.233
What's the name?

48:12.335 --> 48:14.505
Sweetie, I need your name.

48:19.477 --> 48:20.578
Are you okay?

48:38.930 --> 48:40.229
You're missing your tax forms,

48:40.231 --> 48:42.634
your provisional certificate.

48:44.268 --> 48:45.103
Next.

48:47.271 --> 48:50.274
So we have a 211,
Clifford Bianco,

48:51.375 --> 48:53.442
discovered around 7:00 o'clock?

48:53.444 --> 48:55.077
It was
closer to 8:00 o'clock.

48:55.079 --> 48:56.915
And was it just you?

48:58.650 --> 49:00.550
No there were other
people in the building.

49:00.552 --> 49:03.119
But nobody that I don't trust.

49:03.121 --> 49:04.053
Nobody you don't trust.

49:04.055 --> 49:05.254
Okay, okay.

49:05.256 --> 49:06.055
So it was around
8:00 o'clock, okay.

49:06.057 --> 49:07.156
So you trust everybody.

49:07.158 --> 49:08.290
No, I trust everybody

49:08.292 --> 49:11.128
who was in the
building at that time.

49:11.130 --> 49:13.096
Okay so what exactly happened?

49:13.098 --> 49:15.298
Well we were in
here with some money

49:15.300 --> 49:17.701
and it was always
where it's always been

49:17.703 --> 49:20.137
and all of a sudden when I
came back around 8:00 o'clock

49:20.139 --> 49:22.239
it wasn't there anymore.

50:25.772 --> 50:27.205
Where is she?

50:27.207 --> 50:28.506
Is Bella here?

50:28.508 --> 50:29.741
No, she's at work.

50:29.743 --> 50:31.009
If you wanna talk to
her she'll be back soon.

50:31.011 --> 50:32.010
No, I don't wanna
talk to her Danny.

50:32.012 --> 50:33.578
I never even wanted to meet her.

50:33.580 --> 50:36.314
Why couldn't you just leave
things the way that they were?

50:36.316 --> 50:37.515
What was I supposed to do?

50:37.517 --> 50:40.484
Oh you
wanna play rescue now?

50:40.486 --> 50:42.120
- What's that mean?
- Are you a big hero?

50:42.122 --> 50:43.354
This is just like you.

50:43.356 --> 50:44.188
What?

50:44.190 --> 50:45.124
It's just like you.

50:45.126 --> 50:46.158
You know what I'm talking about.

50:46.160 --> 50:47.526
But it wasn't my fault.

50:47.528 --> 50:48.861
You can't keep
blaming me for this.

50:48.863 --> 50:49.695
Well I do.

50:49.697 --> 50:50.698
I blame you.

50:51.933 --> 50:53.265
Who left me for a poker game?

50:53.267 --> 50:55.534
Look, it was your first party.

50:55.536 --> 50:56.802
Nobody told you...
If you had just

50:56.804 --> 50:58.638
walked me home that night...
To leave.

50:58.640 --> 51:00.139
I never would've been raped.

51:00.141 --> 51:02.241
Kim, I'm sorry.

51:02.243 --> 51:04.877
I'm sorry this ever
happened to you.

51:04.879 --> 51:06.411
I've been trying to make
it up to you ever since.

51:06.413 --> 51:08.380
Well you can't.

51:08.382 --> 51:09.649
Well I thought the
least I could do...

51:09.651 --> 51:11.583
The least you could do
is stay out of my life.

51:11.585 --> 51:13.686
And leave the past in the past.

51:13.688 --> 51:16.055
And what about Bella?

51:16.057 --> 51:18.190
What about her?

51:18.192 --> 51:18.993
Ah Kim.

51:20.127 --> 51:21.160
Come on.

51:21.162 --> 51:21.963
Kim!

51:23.798 --> 51:24.766
Kim come on.

51:30.738 --> 51:32.973
I don't understand.

51:32.975 --> 51:35.942
You can come to me for anything.

51:35.944 --> 51:37.543
I know Cliff.

51:37.545 --> 51:39.047
I wasn't thinking.

51:40.015 --> 51:41.116
I'm so sorry.

51:46.121 --> 51:47.122
Come here.

51:50.425 --> 51:53.293
It's okay, I forgive you.

51:53.295 --> 51:55.729
Don't let it happen again.

51:55.731 --> 51:56.564
Okay?

51:58.033 --> 52:02.204
Remember, a thief and his
money will soon be parted.

52:03.171 --> 52:04.637
That's scripture.

52:04.639 --> 52:09.309
I believe it's
a fool and his money.

52:09.311 --> 52:12.679
I believe that's what I said.

52:12.681 --> 52:15.415
Wait, I didn't know
you went to church.

52:15.417 --> 52:16.783
How do you know scripture?

52:16.785 --> 52:19.953
Ah, I wasn't a
scoundrel my whole life.

52:19.955 --> 52:22.690
My mom put some
good things in me.

52:22.692 --> 52:25.827
Sounds like she
was a good mother.

52:25.829 --> 52:28.162
I wish I knew mine.

52:28.164 --> 52:30.564
She's the one
missing out baby girl.

52:35.171 --> 52:36.804
It's late, you should go.

52:36.806 --> 52:38.405
I'll have Bruno give
you a ride, okay?

52:38.407 --> 52:39.575
- Okay.
- Okay.

52:58.061 --> 52:59.961
Hey, it's you again.

52:59.963 --> 53:02.329
Danny, your money's
no good here anymore.

53:02.331 --> 53:03.798
What are you talking
about it's no good?

53:03.800 --> 53:05.800
It's green like
everybody else's, right?

53:05.802 --> 53:07.101
My money's good anywhere.

53:07.103 --> 53:08.569
Go home Danny.

53:08.571 --> 53:09.938
My order's not to let
you in another poker game

53:09.940 --> 53:11.508
in this town, okay?

53:12.542 --> 53:14.242
I guess you're right.

53:14.244 --> 53:15.610
I'll just play one
round and then we'll...

53:15.612 --> 53:17.412
Danny, go home.

53:17.414 --> 53:19.917
Have a good night buddy, okay?

53:25.555 --> 53:28.826
Come on
Uncle Danny, pick up.

53:31.328 --> 53:34.930
We both
know where he went.

53:34.932 --> 53:36.498
But he won't be
out late tonight.

53:36.500 --> 53:39.567
He won't be gambling
for a while.

53:39.569 --> 53:41.970
I just wish he'd
stop gambling.

53:41.972 --> 53:44.574
He has debt all over this city.

53:47.511 --> 53:50.745
Bruno, do you like living here?

53:50.747 --> 53:54.049
I've lived here my whole
life, for better of for worse.

53:54.051 --> 53:56.518
This is where I stay.

53:56.520 --> 53:58.187
Don't you
have any family?

53:58.189 --> 54:01.092
Nah, Mr. Cliff
is my only family.

54:02.861 --> 54:06.529
And if there's one thing you
need to know about family,

54:06.531 --> 54:08.898
we never steal from each other.

54:08.900 --> 54:09.968
You got that?

54:10.802 --> 54:11.968
Yes Bruno.

54:11.970 --> 54:12.804
I got it.

54:15.040 --> 54:19.142
Mr. Bruno, one day we'll
see more of the world.

54:19.144 --> 54:23.748
There is so much out there
that we haven't experienced.

54:24.749 --> 54:27.085
Here you go Bella.

54:28.286 --> 54:31.122
Tell Cliff I say
thanks for today.

54:33.724 --> 54:35.226
Will do.

56:18.498 --> 56:20.031
Bruno.

56:20.033 --> 56:21.333
Get over here.

56:21.335 --> 56:23.002
I'm at the shop.

56:23.004 --> 56:25.004
No, get over here right now.

56:25.006 --> 56:25.839
Okay.

56:53.734 --> 56:55.403
Here, have a seat.

57:00.975 --> 57:02.743
So, why are you here?

57:05.279 --> 57:07.513
It's so funny, I,

57:07.515 --> 57:10.519
I used to live in
this neighborhood.

57:11.653 --> 57:13.420
I used to love it here.

57:13.422 --> 57:15.688
All my friends were here
and we had all these dreams

57:15.690 --> 57:17.526
of changing the world.

57:20.129 --> 57:21.030
I do too.

57:22.164 --> 57:24.998
Getting into school
was my chance.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
I've been calling you for
the past couple of days

57:27.002 --> 57:28.801
about my paperwork.

57:28.803 --> 57:30.937
The deadline was yesterday.

57:30.939 --> 57:32.272
That was my chance.

57:32.274 --> 57:33.542
Oh Bella, I'm,

57:35.177 --> 57:38.578
let's see, there's something
I have to tell you.

57:38.580 --> 57:39.414
What?

57:42.851 --> 57:46.188
I had no idea who
you were a week ago.

57:48.390 --> 57:52.192
And when Clifford called
me, he described you as

57:52.194 --> 57:57.200
a teenage girl that he thought
of as like his own daughter.

57:58.601 --> 58:02.672
So of course I didn't hesitate
when he asked for my help.

58:04.174 --> 58:07.441
Because he saved
my life years ago.

58:07.443 --> 58:09.045
What do you mean?

58:13.349 --> 58:17.685
I was at a party and I
left the party by myself

58:17.687 --> 58:20.090
and something happened to me.

58:28.064 --> 58:30.664
Good morning, I'm
Detective Pollack.

58:30.666 --> 58:33.901
Are you the owner of this house?

58:33.903 --> 58:35.071
No, I'm not.

58:35.971 --> 58:37.505
Are you Bella Collins?

58:37.507 --> 58:39.039
Yes.

58:39.041 --> 58:43.179
We're investigating the
murder of Clifford Bianco.

58:44.848 --> 58:45.682
What?

58:46.817 --> 58:48.917
You mind if I come
in ma'am, for a second?

58:48.919 --> 58:49.753
Bella!

58:54.291 --> 58:55.459
Uncle Danny!

58:58.162 --> 58:59.163
Uncle Danny!

59:02.699 --> 59:03.700
Uncle Danny.

59:05.269 --> 59:07.068
Uncle Danny.

59:07.070 --> 59:08.071
Uncle Danny!

59:25.422 --> 59:26.590
How are you?

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:04.927
Thank you very
much Mr. Collins.

01:00:04.929 --> 01:00:07.563
And as soon as you hear
or remember anything

01:00:07.565 --> 01:00:09.499
gimme a call.

01:00:09.501 --> 01:00:12.268
Also, I'm gonna need a
statement from Bella.

01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:14.870
She was the last one with
the victim before he died

01:00:14.872 --> 01:00:17.072
and well other
than Bruno Mercer.

01:00:17.074 --> 01:00:20.376
So at this point, she's
my only possible lead.

01:00:20.378 --> 01:00:21.345
I understand.

01:00:21.347 --> 01:00:23.180
If you just give her a minute,

01:00:23.182 --> 01:00:27.320
I'll bring her down and
she'll give her statement.

01:00:29.522 --> 01:00:31.054
It's all my fault.

01:00:31.056 --> 01:00:32.523
If I hadn't have
stolen Cliff's money

01:00:32.525 --> 01:00:34.691
he wouldn't have
been there so late.

01:00:34.693 --> 01:00:38.262
And Bruno would've been there
and he would still be alive.

01:00:38.264 --> 01:00:40.197
Bella you don't know that.

01:00:40.199 --> 01:00:42.699
And this is not your fault.

01:00:42.701 --> 01:00:46.002
Who's to say, Bruno
might not even be alive

01:00:46.004 --> 01:00:48.071
if you hadn't left when you did.

01:00:48.073 --> 01:00:50.941
Cliff is dead because of me.

01:00:50.943 --> 01:00:53.277
I've really messed up.

01:00:53.279 --> 01:00:55.448
I have to get out of here.

01:00:56.382 --> 01:00:57.781
It's okay Bella.

01:00:57.783 --> 01:00:58.617
It's okay.

01:01:07.092 --> 01:01:09.263
She couldn't answer any.

01:01:11.565 --> 01:01:13.066
I know who did it.

01:01:15.001 --> 01:01:17.201
I gotta get us outta
this neighborhood.

01:01:17.203 --> 01:01:18.035
What, you know?

01:01:18.037 --> 01:01:19.371
How?

01:01:19.373 --> 01:01:20.938
They came to collect
the debt I owed.

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:22.840
Cliff tried to settle it.

01:01:22.842 --> 01:01:25.042
This was retaliation.

01:01:25.044 --> 01:01:29.614
You gotta
call the police.

01:01:29.616 --> 01:01:30.882
If you know who did this,

01:01:30.884 --> 01:01:32.183
why wouldn't they
just come back?

01:01:32.185 --> 01:01:33.117
You could be in danger,
she could be in danger.

01:01:33.119 --> 01:01:34.051
I mean come on.

01:01:34.053 --> 01:01:34.888
I know.

01:01:36.155 --> 01:01:36.990
I know.

01:01:38.492 --> 01:01:40.458
I'll handle it.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.659
I really don't understand

01:01:41.661 --> 01:01:42.760
why you wouldn't just
pack up and leave.

01:01:42.762 --> 01:01:43.728
Like you?

01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:45.565
Yeah, like me.

01:01:46.733 --> 01:01:48.400
It's not always so easy.

01:01:48.402 --> 01:01:50.101
Not everyone has
a place to run to.

01:01:50.103 --> 01:01:51.303
Yeah that's an excuse Danny.

01:01:51.305 --> 01:01:52.236
Come on, you could
get outta here

01:01:52.238 --> 01:01:53.905
if you really wanted to.

01:01:53.907 --> 01:01:56.509
You should get her outta here.

01:01:56.511 --> 01:01:58.513
Right, so you do care.

01:02:00.281 --> 01:02:01.447
Are you gonna tell her?

01:02:01.449 --> 01:02:04.283
I really don't
wanna deal with this.

01:02:04.285 --> 01:02:05.185
I gotta go.

01:02:46.194 --> 01:02:47.260
Bell!

01:02:47.262 --> 01:02:48.194
What?

01:02:48.196 --> 01:02:49.496
Something came for you?

01:02:49.498 --> 01:02:51.266
What is it?

01:02:52.501 --> 01:02:53.602
Open it up.

01:03:09.084 --> 01:03:11.084
Oh you did it girl.

01:03:11.086 --> 01:03:12.819
You did it.

01:03:12.821 --> 01:03:14.490
I'm so proud of you.

01:03:15.724 --> 01:03:19.060
Here, I have something
else for you too.

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:27.133
Dearest Bella.

01:03:27.135 --> 01:03:29.636
I hope this letter will
answer some of your questions.

01:03:29.638 --> 01:03:32.640
I apologize if I frightened
you on my last visit,

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:35.109
but I was trying to
find the right words.

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:37.978
For years I ran from the
pain of being attacked.

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.947
I thought my life was over.

01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:42.249
As a result I became pregnant.

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:45.085
It was Cliff that talked me
into keeping the pregnancy.

01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:47.388
I knew my parents didn't
believe in abortions,

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:48.689
so I didn't do it.

01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:50.891
Every time I felt the
baby move in my belly,

01:03:50.893 --> 01:03:52.893
I was reminded of that night.

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:55.996
I detached myself
from the pregnancy,

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:59.233
convincing myself I was
carrying it for someone else.

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:01.869
I wanted nothing to
do with that night.

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:04.539
I blamed my boyfriend
for it happening to me.

01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:05.940
I left.

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:08.976
I left him, Cliff,
everything from that time,

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:10.911
and yes, even you.

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:12.346
I didn't think I could love you,

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:14.482
but now I know I was wrong.

01:04:14.484 --> 01:04:16.951
To see you Bella,
makes my heart so glad

01:04:16.953 --> 01:04:18.653
that I didn't make the
mistake of denying you

01:04:18.655 --> 01:04:20.422
such a precious life.

01:04:20.424 --> 01:04:23.191
I don't expect you to
understand my decisions,

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:26.928
but I do wanna be a part of
your life, if you allow me.

01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:29.397
It may take you
awhile to forgive me.

01:04:29.399 --> 01:04:32.133
I can only hope that one day
you will find it in your heart

01:04:32.135 --> 01:04:34.202
to let me be a
part of your life.

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:36.605
I am so sorry for the
pain I must've caused you

01:04:36.607 --> 01:04:38.173
all these years.

01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:39.443
With love, Kim.

01:05:14.178 --> 01:05:15.377
Hi.

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:16.715
Hi, I'm Bella.

01:05:17.649 --> 01:05:19.816
I'm Marco, Kim's husband.

01:05:19.818 --> 01:05:21.385
Please, come on in.

01:05:22.621 --> 01:05:23.454
Kim!

01:05:27.926 --> 01:05:29.225
Nice house.

01:05:29.227 --> 01:05:30.459
Thank you.

01:05:30.461 --> 01:05:32.030
Please have a seat.

01:05:33.097 --> 01:05:34.531
Would you like some water?

01:05:34.533 --> 01:05:35.433
I'm good.

01:05:48.179 --> 01:05:50.615
I get lost in that one too.

01:05:55.253 --> 01:05:58.691
So does this mean that
you got my letter?

01:06:07.667 --> 01:06:08.500
Yeah.

01:07:43.765 --> 01:07:47.166
The ever
so timeless Bella,

01:07:47.168 --> 01:07:49.935
covered under the
umbrella of love,

01:07:49.937 --> 01:07:53.706
her shadows of emptiness
creates troubled memories

01:07:53.708 --> 01:07:56.876
causing her to push
herself out of misery.

01:07:56.878 --> 01:07:58.978
She didn't know that was there.

01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:02.214
She knew of the great
clouds that stood still

01:08:02.216 --> 01:08:05.417
in the hope of the sky
in her life to turn blue.

01:08:05.419 --> 01:08:07.987
She knew that life
in her would breathe

01:08:07.989 --> 01:08:09.621
if she would just believe,

01:08:09.623 --> 01:08:12.725
forgive the things in her
life that she cannot see,

01:08:12.727 --> 01:08:14.727
'cause the offspring
of her presence

01:08:14.729 --> 01:08:17.562
became a blessing
to open wounds,

01:08:17.564 --> 01:08:20.300
healed by harmonious,
heavenly tunes

01:08:20.301 --> 01:08:23.002
that comforts her
spirit like the moon.

01:08:23.005 --> 01:08:25.037
Embrace the tales of fruition

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.675
that slowly dwindles in the
corner of her intuition,

01:08:28.676 --> 01:08:30.443
the people who loved her most

01:08:30.444 --> 01:08:32.178
didn't know what
they were missing.

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:35.881
And the ones who did were
grateful that they met her,

01:08:35.884 --> 01:08:38.120
the young, beautiful Bella.
