WEBVTT

00:42.209 --> 00:45.212
This guy die or something?
'Cause I get queasy.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.089
If he did, you got to tell me now

00:47.089 --> 00:49.174
'cause I can't be
walking in with no dead body.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.885
I do locks and light bulbs.
Blood isn't my thing.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.220
Can you open it or not?

00:53.220 --> 00:56.265
Yeah. I'm trying
but these keys aren't working.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.603
Was this Trumbull guy Judicial?

01:01.603 --> 01:04.940
- I'm not at liberty to--
- If so, I'll need a different set.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.525
Maybe tomorrow we can come back--

01:06.525 --> 01:08.819
- With the Forgiveness Holiday--
- Is there another way in?

01:08.819 --> 01:11.071
- Yeah, but Judge Meadows--
- Sheriff. Hey--

01:11.071 --> 01:13.407
What are you-- Wait, what are you...

01:17.870 --> 01:19.872
IT distro probably cut the power early.

01:19.872 --> 01:22.374
Yeah, but protocol requires
the power be on--

01:22.374 --> 01:24.668
Can you head to distro
and get the lights back on?

01:24.668 --> 01:26.086
- Yeah.
- Great.

01:26.795 --> 01:28.881
You two take the kitchen.
I'm gonna check the bedroom.

01:28.881 --> 01:31.800
- What are we looking for?
- For anything strange

01:31.800 --> 01:33.927
that might tell us
why Trumbull killed Marnes.

01:51.195 --> 01:53.697
- You go in there yet?
- No. Anything in the front?

01:53.697 --> 01:54.948
Not yet.

02:08.252 --> 02:09.795
What the heck is this?

02:11.965 --> 02:14.092
- What you got?
- Honestly, I don't know.

02:15.344 --> 02:16.345
But...

02:19.598 --> 02:21.099
We're gonna need a relics bag.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.759
What are you smiling at?

04:21.637 --> 04:22.638
At you, I guess.

04:23.847 --> 04:26.141
You know they call you
Creepy George, right?

04:26.850 --> 04:28.936
They've scratched it on the side
of the generator.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.355
- It says, "Beware of Creepy George."
- Okay. First off...

04:31.355 --> 04:33.273
- "He is so creepy."
- ...you shut up.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.902
- You would never allow generator graffiti.
- Yeah, that's true.

04:36.902 --> 04:37.819
And second,

04:37.819 --> 04:41.323
if you'd said, "creepy computer guy,"
I might have believed you.

04:41.323 --> 04:44.201
In fact, Creepy George,
if he really is a thing,

04:45.953 --> 04:47.204
probably just another guy.

04:47.871 --> 04:51.416
Am I your only friend? Like,
I know I'm your only friend down here,

04:51.416 --> 04:55.087
but am I your only friend
in the entire Silo?

04:55.087 --> 04:56.755
'Cause that's pretty sad.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.883
No. It's pretty great.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.012
I mean, if I gotta have one.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.227
You wanna keep that?

05:11.854 --> 05:15.232
What, if I wanna risk going to prison
or sent down to the mines

05:15.232 --> 05:17.943
for one of your strange toys? No.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.864
We already broke into Supply together
so you could have your precious tape.

05:21.864 --> 05:26.118
No, so Mechanical and the Silo
could have its necessary tape.

05:26.118 --> 05:29.121
- And you, sir, did nothing.
- Hey.

05:29.121 --> 05:30.664
No. You drew a map.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.584
A really shitty map.
I did everything else by myself,

05:33.584 --> 05:36.753
including throwing bacon at dogs
and running like crazy.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.213
But for a roll of tape.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.426
George, that tape saves lives, okay?

05:43.552 --> 05:45.137
Maybe not IT's shitty tape,

05:45.137 --> 05:47.806
but Mechanical's does,
and that's why I did it.

05:47.806 --> 05:50.893
I didn't take a risk for myself.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.104
I did it for everyone,

05:54.104 --> 05:59.193
and these strange things you have here,

05:59.193 --> 06:01.153
they're just not worth risking a life for.

06:01.153 --> 06:02.654
Especially when you don't know
what they are.

06:02.654 --> 06:06.658
If these things aren't worth
risking our lives for,

06:07.659 --> 06:10.245
why do they make it a risk to our lives
to have them?

06:13.916 --> 06:15.250
I don't know.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.335
Neither do I.

06:17.753 --> 06:22.716
These things were used by someone
for something at some point as tools.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.635
I'm gonna use 'em as clues.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.303
It's a stupidly dangerous hobby.

06:26.303 --> 06:30.140
And not all of these things are illegal,
by the way.

06:30.807 --> 06:31.808
Okay.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.354
This...

06:36.563 --> 06:43.237
may not appear as valuable
as a refurbished socket wrench

06:43.237 --> 06:48.242
or as romantic as flowers from the Mids.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.619
But to me, this watch...

06:53.580 --> 06:54.665
is everything.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.129
And I want to give it to you.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.643
George, it's broken.

07:14.643 --> 07:18.897
No, I'm serious. It's like a paperweight
cheaper than the paper it would hold up.

07:18.897 --> 07:20.315
It's a gift.

07:23.026 --> 07:26.989
And in a world filled with a million
unknowns, it is possible that this watch

07:26.989 --> 07:29.741
and crazy relics like these...

07:29.741 --> 07:31.451
- George.
- ...are the key to answering

07:31.451 --> 07:33.161
- the Silo's biggest questions.
- George.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.539
Are you not gonna ask
what the Silo's biggest question is?

07:35.539 --> 07:37.165
Just stop talking, please.

07:38.542 --> 07:39.877
Before you fuck it all up.

08:57.704 --> 08:58.914
Shit.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.708
You didn't take that to Judicial?

09:01.708 --> 09:03.126
You're in early.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.503
First day you beat me in.

09:05.838 --> 09:07.548
Is that a note for me?

09:07.548 --> 09:09.508
A porter brought it from Recycling.

09:12.970 --> 09:15.848
Keeping an illegal relic
beyond the 12-hour window

09:15.848 --> 09:18.809
from discovery to Judicial handoff
is a serious crime.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.477
Even for a sheriff.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.606
- How do you know it's illegal?
- I know that I don't know.

09:25.190 --> 09:29.862
Clause 75A-11: An investigation
into relics may be conducted

09:29.862 --> 09:32.906
by either the sheriff
or the Judicial Department when the re--

09:32.906 --> 09:35.534
When the identified relic
is associated with a serious crime.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.077
I'd say murder qualifies.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.372
You read the next paragraph?
That's only with Judicial's approval.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.874
Which means?

09:41.874 --> 09:45.169
If you want a relics investigation,
you have to see Judge Meadows.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.506
I'm hearing that a lot. Why don't they rip
the pages out of the Pact

09:49.506 --> 09:51.717
and leave one that says,
"See Judge Meadows"?

09:52.676 --> 09:53.886
You've talked to her, right?

09:53.886 --> 09:56.388
She'd pass through the office
when I was at Judicial.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.765
But these days,
even when you win the Pact competition,

09:58.765 --> 10:00.267
it's Sims who gives you the pin.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.437
There's a competition
for knowing the Pact?

10:03.437 --> 10:04.521
I won it four times.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.940
- More than anyone else.
- Of course you did.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.485
But I was just a Judicial regular.

10:10.485 --> 10:11.737
You're the sheriff.

10:11.737 --> 10:14.281
If you wanna meet with Meadows,
that's another thing entirely.

10:17.826 --> 10:22.623
Happy Forgiveness Day.
Today is for unity, family and friends.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.667
- Happy Forgiveness Day.
- Good morning.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.005
- Billings. Sheriff.
- Sims.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.760
- How are things?
- Good.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.804
- How's Judicial?
- Everything is good.

10:58.492 --> 10:59.493
Judge.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.091
I'm not feeling well,
so let's make this quick.

11:14.091 --> 11:16.510
I'm here about the investigation
into Trumbull.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.679
- I thought that was settled.
- It is.

11:18.679 --> 11:22.266
Well, this was found about ten hours ago
by Deputy Billings

11:22.266 --> 11:25.561
on a search we did with Deputy Karins.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.104
Where?

11:28.230 --> 11:30.649
Trumbull's apartment.
In the bathroom, sir.

11:31.567 --> 11:33.569
I'd like to conduct a relics investigation

11:33.569 --> 11:36.780
as a way to identify possible
offenders, like Trumbull,

11:36.780 --> 11:38.740
before they have a chance to act.

11:39.825 --> 11:43.745
Judge, the Pact says that the gateway
to disruptive criminal activity

11:43.745 --> 11:48.834
- often starts with unli--
- Unlicensed documents and relics. I know.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.713
But this relic, what is it?

11:52.713 --> 11:55.299
I don't know.
That's why I want to look into it.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.259
This didn't belong to Trumbull.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.470
I don't care where you found it.
It isn't his.

12:01.972 --> 12:06.101
You are aware we have files on every relic
found within the last 140 years.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.936
Yeah,
but I looked into the database, and--

12:07.936 --> 12:11.523
I wasn't saying "we" meaning all of us.
I mean "we" as in Judicial.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.943
We have a far more extensive catalog
of information.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.779
For example,
that watch you wear on your wrist.

12:17.779 --> 12:21.533
In Judicial, we know, I know,
that particular item,

12:21.533 --> 12:23.410
despite being in your possession,

12:23.410 --> 12:27.581
is currently registered
to a now-deceased George Wilkins.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.501
A man who you claim was murdered.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.087
Accidents happen.

12:35.005 --> 12:38.217
And Sheriff Becker made me realize
that Wilkins' death was one of them.

12:38.217 --> 12:40.761
That's why I'd like to open
this investigation.

12:40.761 --> 12:43.514
So that we can know those things
that are not in your catalog.

12:44.389 --> 12:47.434
Like the fact that your very close
colleague, Douglas Trumbull,

12:47.434 --> 12:49.061
- was a murderer.
- Sheriff Nichols.

12:49.061 --> 12:51.271
Judge, if I may?

12:51.897 --> 12:52.898
You may.

12:53.815 --> 12:57.152
Let's wrap it up. I wanna get home
before I have to fight through a crowd.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.867
A relics investigation
is actually a smart play.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.036
Especially today
with the Forgiveness Holiday,

13:06.036 --> 13:08.205
people will be more inclined
to turn over items

13:08.205 --> 13:11.083
without facing legal jeopardy.
So, I'm fine with it...

13:11.083 --> 13:13.544
- Okay.
- ...as long as you take Paul with you.

13:13.544 --> 13:17.005
You probably know less of the Pact
than my son does.

13:17.005 --> 13:20.133
You'll need a specialist with you
at all times, creating a list.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.679
Every offense, every relic
and the names of who has what.

13:24.263 --> 13:26.014
Yeah, of course.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.861
- What's the plan?
- You can head back up. See you in an hour.

13:38.861 --> 13:41.363
Sheriff, with Sims taking interest,

13:41.363 --> 13:44.783
Judicial will be watching you
everywhere you go. Every level.

13:44.783 --> 13:49.037
Either his guys or the whispering friends
of the Silo. And they could be anybody.

13:49.621 --> 13:52.499
So, like it or not,
today I'm with you all the way.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.628
I know a guy who's been busted for relics,
and he owes me one.

13:56.628 --> 13:57.713
Let's go.

14:20.986 --> 14:24.156
- Fuck me. Who'd I kill this time?
- I've got a relic question.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.700
For someone at this address?

14:28.118 --> 14:29.912
You coming out, or are we going in?

14:33.665 --> 14:36.293
Look, I don't know what Marnes
told you about me, but I'm a simple man.

14:36.293 --> 14:40.297
I paint walls. That's how I make
my living. I don't deal illegal relics.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.049
So, who do I see about legal ones?

14:44.468 --> 14:45.636
Couldn't say.

14:46.762 --> 14:48.096
I don't deal anymore.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.265
Especially things like that.

14:50.265 --> 14:51.391
A watch?

14:52.059 --> 14:54.686
- A working watch. Who the fuck are you?
- Hey.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.356
The old guys at least had the decency
to identify themselves.

14:57.356 --> 14:59.316
I'm Deputy Billings.
The new Deputy Sheriff.

14:59.316 --> 15:00.234
Like I give a fuck.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.659
Sheriff, I don't know what you're looking
for me to do, okay?

15:08.659 --> 15:11.745
But I feel like no matter what I say
or I don't say, you're gonna arrest me.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.539
No, not on the Forgiveness Holiday.

15:13.539 --> 15:14.998
Bullshit. You don't arrest me now,

15:14.998 --> 15:18.877
you put my name on a list put together
by Judicial-face here. And then what?

15:18.877 --> 15:22.214
One day, out of the blue,
I'm just doing law-abiding shit--

15:22.214 --> 15:24.341
- 'Cause you're just a simple man.
- Exactly.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.760
Then there's a knock on the door.
You know what? Not even.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.638
Maybe there's just a sheriff
with a crowbar,

15:29.638 --> 15:31.890
and I'm yanked out of my place
for something I didn't do.

15:31.890 --> 15:34.852
- So, no. I don't know anyone.
- You know what, Kennedy?

15:34.852 --> 15:37.145
This sheriff is the only reason
you're not in jail.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.147
And you are obviously having regrets.

15:39.147 --> 15:42.818
This is not about you.
We're looking into relics.

15:43.402 --> 15:49.533
That watch is a very peculiar relic
to be using to investigate all relics.

15:49.533 --> 15:52.244
And it's on your arm
not in an evidence bag,

15:52.244 --> 15:54.580
which makes me believe
that it's personal to you.

15:54.580 --> 15:55.831
And in my experience,

15:56.498 --> 16:00.127
people with badges doing things
for personal reasons

16:00.127 --> 16:02.421
tend to get other people hurt.

16:04.298 --> 16:07.009
So you're giving us a name,
or are we leaving with yours?

16:09.178 --> 16:10.304
Your choice.

16:11.763 --> 16:12.931
How about this?

16:13.932 --> 16:17.686
How about you give me the watch,
I try to sell it, and if I do,

16:17.686 --> 16:19.771
I'll give you the name
of the person I sold it to.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.106
How about this?

16:23.025 --> 16:24.610
Shit. Sheriff.

16:24.610 --> 16:26.153
Hey. All right.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.780
I need you and Holston Junior
to stop showing up here, okay?

16:28.780 --> 16:31.909
You know, I saw there's a lot of space
outside your apartment.

16:31.909 --> 16:33.243
Room enough for two beds.

16:33.243 --> 16:34.786
- Yeah.
- We could make ourselves at home.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.371
- We could move in.
- Come back every day?

16:36.371 --> 16:38.540
- Every day.
- Or you could give us a name.

16:41.877 --> 16:46.840
There's only one name that I can give you

16:46.840 --> 16:48.509
without destroying my livelihood.

16:48.509 --> 16:50.010
- As a painter?
- No.

16:50.719 --> 16:55.724
As a man who's had his family destroyed
by this fucking bullshit.

16:57.559 --> 16:58.977
You got a pen, Mr. Billingsley?

17:37.349 --> 17:40.727
Travel the Silo.
Today's for unity, family and friends.

17:40.727 --> 17:44.857
Happy Forgiveness Day.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.694
Travel the Silo. Happy Forgiveness Day.

17:59.538 --> 18:01.915
You know, people leave traces.

18:02.499 --> 18:05.586
History is just traces
of a whole lot of people

18:06.503 --> 18:08.172
over a whole lot of time.

18:08.881 --> 18:13.343
Everything from the shirt on my back
to the shoes on our feet.

18:13.343 --> 18:17.931
You know, if we wanted, we could pinpoint
the exact place that it was stitched

18:17.931 --> 18:20.184
- or the person who wore it last.
- Really?

18:20.184 --> 18:22.519
- The exact same?
- Yeah, uh-huh. Yes, the exact same.

18:22.519 --> 18:25.022
- You want tea? Yeah.
- Yeah, please.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.232
Sorry. Continue.

18:28.108 --> 18:31.111
- It's fascinating, though, right?
- Yeah. I mean, it's so fascinating.

18:31.695 --> 18:34.281
- You don't appreciate that?
- No, I do.

18:40.871 --> 18:44.708
Don't you ever think about the world
beyond the Silo?

18:44.708 --> 18:47.002
No. When would I have time to do that?

18:47.586 --> 18:51.507
Even now, I'm worried some idiot
is tightening the wrong bolts

18:51.507 --> 18:53.217
or misreading the pressure valve.

18:53.217 --> 18:54.676
You're looking at my beautiful face

18:54.676 --> 18:56.678
and thinking about some idiot
with his pressure bolts.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.639
- Pressure valve.
- Pressure valve.

18:58.639 --> 19:01.099
And yeah,
'cause your face kind of looks like one.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.853
Sounds like the kind of thing
women and men in Mechanical dream about.

19:04.853 --> 19:06.271
- Pressure valve.
- Oh, yeah?

19:06.271 --> 19:07.231
Definitely.

19:07.231 --> 19:10.067
You know, while you're down here
dreaming of your world beyond worlds--

19:10.067 --> 19:12.778
- You're the one that showed me this place.
- Yeah.

19:13.529 --> 19:17.324
But I'm the one in Mechanical,
keeping you dreamers alive.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.784
Is that so?

19:20.244 --> 19:21.286
Yeah.

19:22.704 --> 19:25.123
'Cause I'm the one
that keeps things running.

19:34.299 --> 19:38.011
- This must have taken you hours.
- Yeah. Time I don't have.

19:40.097 --> 19:41.098
So...

19:42.850 --> 19:43.851
why?

19:46.353 --> 19:48.772
'Cause when you talk about these things,

19:49.898 --> 19:54.570
something ignites in you,
and I can see it on your face.

19:54.570 --> 19:56.947
And I don't see that on a lot of people.

19:56.947 --> 20:02.494
And, you know, whatever that feeling is,

20:03.704 --> 20:06.623
when you feel it, I feel that too.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.920
And it's not just here.

20:12.504 --> 20:16.133
It's afterwards.

20:19.678 --> 20:20.679
It's--

20:22.055 --> 20:24.683
What I'm trying to say is,
I fixed your watch for selfish reasons

20:24.683 --> 20:29.229
'cause I really like the way that I feel
when I make you feel the way that you do.

20:32.608 --> 20:34.234
Hey, how'd you get it working?

20:35.402 --> 20:37.613
It was easy to fix once
I'd made the right tools.

20:38.113 --> 20:39.865
- You made the tools?
- Yeah.

20:41.867 --> 20:43.327
Juliette Nichols,

20:44.703 --> 20:48.498
you are truly...

20:49.208 --> 20:50.334
Okay, but...

20:51.502 --> 20:52.503
...incredible.

21:04.223 --> 21:05.432
I know.

21:07.601 --> 21:09.019
Soon, baby.

21:26.036 --> 21:27.037
Regina Jackson?

21:30.332 --> 21:31.333
Come in.

21:40.634 --> 21:42.719
Never thought I'd see that again.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.680
I'm sorry, what?

21:45.639 --> 21:46.890
That watch.

21:49.726 --> 21:50.727
You know it?

21:51.770 --> 21:54.523
Of course I do.
It belonged to my boyfriend.

22:23.802 --> 22:26.638
So, how is George?

22:29.183 --> 22:30.225
He's dead.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.896
He fell off the stairs a few months ago.

22:44.990 --> 22:47.951
Either of you know George,
or is the watch just something you found?

22:49.453 --> 22:51.622
No, I worked with him
before I became sheriff.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.291
- In Mechanical?
- Yeah.

22:58.962 --> 23:01.298
Ms. Jackson, are you in possession
of any relics? Legal--

23:01.298 --> 23:03.383
Last time I saw him,
that's where he was headed.

23:03.383 --> 23:04.927
Moving on to the next thing.

23:05.969 --> 23:06.970
The next person.

23:10.015 --> 23:13.227
No, I don't have any relics. Not anymore.

23:13.227 --> 23:17.523
Anything I had, and there was a lot,
I got for him.

23:20.150 --> 23:21.568
Somebody give you my name?

23:23.070 --> 23:24.488
Happens a lot.

23:25.364 --> 23:28.784
But I'm no dealer.
George had me buying things for him.

23:29.993 --> 23:34.206
I come from a big family.
Lots of aunts, uncles, cousins.

23:35.332 --> 23:39.378
He figured it would justify
the purchases if Judicial looked into it.

23:40.212 --> 23:43.215
He had no one, so he used me to get them.

23:43.215 --> 23:46.260
- All legal items? Or were there--
- Was your relationship sanctioned?

23:47.010 --> 23:49.638
George didn't do sanctioned relationships.

23:50.430 --> 23:53.642
And any fool would see he's not the type
of guy you spend forever with.

23:56.895 --> 24:00.941
Legal? Sure, I guess.
But how does anyone know?

24:01.525 --> 24:02.568
You ask.

24:03.402 --> 24:05.612
I walk into a law enforcement agency

24:05.612 --> 24:09.616
and ask if the item I now possess
is an illegal possession?

24:10.284 --> 24:11.952
Seems like I'm making it easy for them.

24:11.952 --> 24:16.582
Did you see or hear from him
after he went down to Mechanical?

24:17.833 --> 24:19.418
You ask a lot of questions.

24:21.336 --> 24:22.671
Look, Sheriff,

24:24.006 --> 24:27.467
George went down to Mechanical to explore
what he called "the big questions."

24:27.968 --> 24:29.261
Illegal questions.

24:29.261 --> 24:32.890
He got what he wanted from me.
He didn't need me anymore, so he left.

24:33.807 --> 24:38.020
Probably in pursuit of someone new
down deep who could give him a hand.

24:40.230 --> 24:42.065
What illegal questions
are we talking about?

24:42.065 --> 24:44.610
I've been over this time and again
with Judicial.

24:45.736 --> 24:48.155
Those aunts and uncles I told you about,
so have they.

24:49.156 --> 24:51.074
George and those relics cost me a lot.

24:51.783 --> 24:54.953
He lost his family,
but he didn't mind isolating me from mine.

24:58.624 --> 25:00.000
He was good with words.

25:04.129 --> 25:07.674
Thank you for your time, Ms. Jackson.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.219
- If you have any questions, we can def--
- I do.

25:15.891 --> 25:19.561
When he told you he loved you,
did you believe him?

25:24.942 --> 25:25.943
Thank you.

25:47.381 --> 25:49.216
There's no way
that woman's all there, right?

25:49.216 --> 25:51.301
Her place is like
the junk room at Recycling.

25:51.301 --> 25:52.928
And the smell of that cat food.

25:53.846 --> 25:55.097
You all right?

25:55.097 --> 25:56.849
Yeah, I'm great.

26:30.132 --> 26:31.466
We need the room.

26:45.439 --> 26:46.440
Come on, man.

26:59.077 --> 27:01.246
There's an interview
with a confidential informant

27:01.246 --> 27:04.416
that indicates the relic
you brought in earlier

27:04.416 --> 27:06.210
was an illegal possession

27:06.210 --> 27:09.296
belonging to your colleague,
George Wilkins.

27:11.381 --> 27:12.633
I don't understand.

27:12.633 --> 27:14.510
According to Judicial records,

27:14.510 --> 27:17.679
a search was conducted
of Wilkins's place before he died.

27:18.180 --> 27:20.224
In that search, they found nothing.

27:20.807 --> 27:21.808
But last night,

27:21.808 --> 27:25.437
Wilkins's relic mysteriously appeared
in Trumbull's apartment

27:25.938 --> 27:28.190
as a result
of a search coordinated by you.

27:28.899 --> 27:32.110
First time I ever saw that relic
was last night in Trumbull's place

27:32.778 --> 27:35.155
- when Billings showed it to me.
- Wait--

27:35.155 --> 27:39.701
Sims, George and I were friends.
Beyond this watch...

27:39.701 --> 27:40.911
Beyond that?

27:41.578 --> 27:43.455
I never received anything from him,

27:43.956 --> 27:46.917
especially something as ridiculous
as that thing.

27:53.340 --> 27:55.217
I have a question.

27:55.217 --> 27:56.802
For Mr. Sims.

27:56.802 --> 28:01.139
On the day Judicial searched
George Wilkins's apartment,

28:01.139 --> 28:04.726
was Trumbull a member of the search team?

28:04.726 --> 28:07.980
Mayor, the name of Judicial's search team
members are strictly confidential.

28:07.980 --> 28:09.064
You know that.

28:09.064 --> 28:11.859
I am in no way required
to reveal that information

28:11.859 --> 28:14.152
to the Sheriff's Department
or the Mayor's Office.

28:14.152 --> 28:16.238
But if Trumbull was on that search team,

28:17.072 --> 28:19.491
is it even slightly possible
that he simply thought

28:19.491 --> 28:23.453
that the artifact was a harmless curio
and decided to take it home for himself?

28:23.453 --> 28:25.581
You want me to entertain a hypothetical.

28:25.581 --> 28:29.209
- I'm not going to do that.
- Theoretically, it is possible. Yes?

28:33.213 --> 28:37.092
In your search,
did you find anything to explain

28:37.092 --> 28:41.096
why Trumbull would wanna
murder Marnes and Jahns?

28:42.598 --> 28:48.020
- No. Not yet. I--
- No. As far as everybody knows,

28:48.020 --> 28:51.857
Marnes and Jahns died of heart issues
brought on by walking the Silo.

28:52.900 --> 28:55.027
Any further investigation
might expose the truth,

28:55.027 --> 28:56.820
and that could prove destabilizing.

28:58.697 --> 29:00.449
I know not everyone believes this,

29:00.449 --> 29:05.537
but I've found that some mysteries
are best left

29:06.538 --> 29:07.789
unsolved.

29:09.833 --> 29:10.834
Mr. Sims.

29:32.231 --> 29:34.608
Thank you for not telling them
about me and George.

29:35.651 --> 29:38.237
Did you plant that relic so I'd find it?

29:41.281 --> 29:43.742
Your decision could've gotten me jailed
or even sent to clean.

29:43.742 --> 29:45.244
I wouldn't have let that happen.

29:45.244 --> 29:48.413
You brought up my name with them
just as soon as they came at you.

29:48.413 --> 29:53.544
Juliette, I have a family. A wife, a baby.

29:55.420 --> 29:57.464
I know having some Judicial-minded deputy

29:57.464 --> 30:00.300
who lives by every letter of the Pact
can be annoying.

30:00.300 --> 30:03.136
But you have to be honest with me.

30:03.136 --> 30:07.182
Honest, as if not only your life
but mine depended on it.

30:08.225 --> 30:09.226
I'll try.

30:10.477 --> 30:12.688
- You'll try?
- Yeah. That's what I can do.

30:13.730 --> 30:15.524
Juliette, you're the sheriff of the Silo,

30:15.524 --> 30:17.693
and you can't commit
to being honest with me?

30:17.693 --> 30:20.737
Shoot, maybe you and this George guy
were perfect for each other.

30:22.739 --> 30:24.825
- You want honesty?
- I do.

30:25.742 --> 30:28.328
Your hands shake.
You have flashes of pain.

30:28.328 --> 30:29.246
Sheriff--

30:29.246 --> 30:31.039
Under pressure,
you clench your hand so tight,

30:31.039 --> 30:32.666
I'm surprised your fingers don't fall off.

30:32.666 --> 30:33.917
You have the Syndrome.

30:35.752 --> 30:39.590
And you're hiding it. So, Deputy,
living by the letter of the Pact,

30:39.590 --> 30:42.342
you know it's a crime what you're doing,
not reporting yourself.

30:42.342 --> 30:44.178
- I do.
- And according to the Pact,

30:44.178 --> 30:47.097
you're in no way qualified
to be in a position of authority,

30:47.097 --> 30:49.349
to have access to a firearm,

30:49.349 --> 30:52.978
to detain criminals,
to even be a deputy in this department.

30:54.938 --> 30:56.481
There's a way to do this.

30:58.150 --> 31:00.110
And what you're doing now is not it.

31:00.819 --> 31:02.988
- You called me dishonest.
- I did not.

31:02.988 --> 31:04.364
- No?
- No.

31:04.364 --> 31:06.950
I only asked you to be honest,
and if you weren't gonna be,

31:06.950 --> 31:09.661
to let me know
rather than set me up to take the fall.

31:10.537 --> 31:14.291
Everybody in the office says the reason
Holston and Marnes were a great team

31:14.291 --> 31:16.001
was because they looked out
for each other.

31:16.001 --> 31:17.461
And look what that got them.

31:22.799 --> 31:24.134
Good night, Sheriff.

31:30.849 --> 31:32.184
Shit.

31:33.101 --> 31:34.770
- Hey. Happy Forgiveness Day.
- Hey.

31:34.770 --> 31:36.730
Happy Forgiveness Day, Deputy.

32:05.384 --> 32:06.635
How was your day?

32:10.013 --> 32:11.014
I've had better.

32:13.809 --> 32:14.977
No lights tonight?

32:16.937 --> 32:21.608
You know, my mother used to tell me
when I was a child that

32:22.609 --> 32:26.280
you shouldn't give up on the day,
even at the end of it, 'cause...

32:26.780 --> 32:30.742
Well, she said that a whole day
could be saved with just a smile.

32:33.912 --> 32:36.248
Lukas, you've never had a girlfriend,
have you?

32:38.083 --> 32:38.917
Tons.

32:38.917 --> 32:40.169
Not one.

32:40.169 --> 32:41.628
So many.

32:41.628 --> 32:46.175
Like, every other level,
there is another lady friend.

32:49.052 --> 32:50.971
And there. See?

32:50.971 --> 32:52.055
There see what?

32:52.639 --> 32:54.141
Smile. Like my mom said.

32:54.141 --> 32:57.144
This was not with you. This was at you.

32:58.187 --> 32:59.229
I'll still take it.

33:02.941 --> 33:05.277
You don't have your slate
with you tonight.

33:05.777 --> 33:08.280
Well, a cafeteria worker
on my level told me

33:08.280 --> 33:10.490
that it was gonna be cloudy
this evening, so I...

33:10.490 --> 33:12.117
You came up anyway?

33:12.993 --> 33:15.746
Yeah, I came to see you.

33:19.208 --> 33:21.543
Wow, that's terrible.

33:21.543 --> 33:23.754
- Wow.
- That is a good line.

33:23.754 --> 33:26.006
I didn't think it could get worse,
but you found a way.

33:26.006 --> 33:28.675
Okay, well, you're still smiling,
so whatever.

33:28.675 --> 33:30.928
Okay, I'll-- Take care.

33:32.054 --> 33:34.056
See you tomorrow, Sheriff?

33:48.362 --> 33:49.363
Honey?

33:50.447 --> 33:52.074
Who's here?

33:55.369 --> 33:56.578
Oh, my goodness.

33:58.163 --> 33:59.122
Yeah.

34:00.207 --> 34:01.208
Yeah.

34:06.964 --> 34:08.465
- Hi.
- Hey.

34:13.469 --> 34:14.471
Look at you.

34:17.056 --> 34:20.268
How was your day? Daddy loves you.

34:20.268 --> 34:22.521
You okay? Look at your hands.

34:22.521 --> 34:24.940
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Sit down.

34:26.775 --> 34:28.735
- Honey, please sit.
- Okay.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.114
Yeah.

34:33.824 --> 34:36.743
Take off your shirt.
Did you eat the ginger root I gave you?

34:38.286 --> 34:39.454
I couldn't.

34:41.123 --> 34:42.623
I wasn't alone at all today.

34:43.208 --> 34:44.793
She had you with her all day?

34:46.712 --> 34:47.920
Finally trust you?

34:49.715 --> 34:51.842
I don't think she's the trusting type.

34:52.509 --> 34:55.637
She'll come around.
She should be honored to have you.

35:20.162 --> 35:22.706
Honey, has it happened yet?

35:23.373 --> 35:24.458
What's that?

35:25.959 --> 35:27.419
Have you seen any signs in Claire?

35:28.504 --> 35:30.214
You know it doesn't work that way.

35:31.131 --> 35:33.467
Just because you have it
doesn't mean she will.

35:34.510 --> 35:35.552
But I worry.

35:36.845 --> 35:37.846
I know.

35:40.974 --> 35:45.312
But right now, let's just worry
about getting you fixed up

35:46.605 --> 35:48.232
so that you can get some sleep.

35:56.031 --> 35:57.032
Kath.

35:57.658 --> 36:00.577
- Honey, you don't need to--
- I'm thankful for you and Claire.

36:03.747 --> 36:07.251
I can't imagine life in the Silo
if I was all by myself.

36:35.904 --> 36:36.905
George?

36:38.866 --> 36:40.534
What's the big question?

36:43.036 --> 36:44.413
There's a lot of them.

36:48.208 --> 36:50.460
What's outside?

36:50.460 --> 36:54.798
What's beyond what the sensor can see?

36:57.092 --> 36:58.552
Why are we here?

36:59.261 --> 37:01.805
How long have we been here?

37:04.016 --> 37:06.310
How much time do we have left?

37:10.063 --> 37:12.107
But what's the biggest one?

37:18.864 --> 37:22.284
What if everything you know to be true,

37:22.284 --> 37:26.205
everything you've been told
by the people you love...

37:28.540 --> 37:34.087
was in fact just one big lie?

38:09.581 --> 38:10.582
Walk?

38:13.126 --> 38:14.127
<i>Walk?</i>

38:19.341 --> 38:21.552
Hey, it's late.

38:22.636 --> 38:24.012
Yeah, it's so quiet.

38:27.558 --> 38:28.934
It's time to come home.

38:32.354 --> 38:33.355
Yeah?

38:35.065 --> 38:38.652
Yeah. In the morning,
I'm gonna do what you said.

38:39.403 --> 38:41.572
I'm gonna turn in the badge and resign.

38:44.658 --> 38:47.244
So did you figure out what happened?

38:50.163 --> 38:51.832
No, couldn't give a fuck.

38:54.001 --> 38:57.546
Turns out the person I was doing it for
wasn't worth the trip, so...

38:59.548 --> 39:02.509
So did you leave here
and go all the way up top for him

39:02.509 --> 39:05.637
or 'cause it was the right thing to do?

39:06.930 --> 39:10.392
I mean, shit, the man's dead.
He didn't ask you to go up there.

39:14.271 --> 39:15.689
It's just-- It's a waste of time.

39:16.565 --> 39:17.566
Time?

39:19.151 --> 39:21.278
You got no concept of time.

39:22.112 --> 39:23.614
You think you do, but you don't.

39:24.740 --> 39:27.409
<i>It's 'cause you got a whole lot more
ahead of you than behind.</i>

39:28.410 --> 39:30.913
<i>Time to you is just an idea.</i>

39:30.913 --> 39:37.127
<i>To me, it's years spent trapped
behind a closed door with memories.</i>

39:37.127 --> 39:39.963
<i>All your friends and loved ones
somewhere out there,</i>

39:40.714 --> 39:41.965
<i>the other side of it.</i>

39:43.550 --> 39:45.177
You can talk to me about time

39:45.177 --> 39:47.596
when you can't
bring yourself to step out the door.

39:50.516 --> 39:52.518
When seconds have become years.

39:55.020 --> 39:57.105
He's not the person I thought he was.

39:58.941 --> 40:00.734
What kind of a person are you?

40:02.694 --> 40:04.321
The man you loved was murdered,

40:04.321 --> 40:09.535
and now you're saying it's a waste of time
to find out why?

40:15.207 --> 40:16.875
See, I don't know what happened,

40:16.875 --> 40:20.212
but when you left here,
love had you trying to do the right thing.

40:21.046 --> 40:24.007
And now anger is making you give up?

40:25.509 --> 40:27.553
<i>Fear did the same thing to me.</i>

40:29.763 --> 40:31.390
And that is a waste of time.

40:37.062 --> 40:39.356
You're welcome to come here and join me.

40:41.775 --> 40:43.402
<i>Or you can stay where you are,</i>

40:44.862 --> 40:51.118
let go of whatever it is you're
wrestling with and finish the job.

40:51.869 --> 40:52.870
<i>It's your call.</i>

41:39.666 --> 41:41.752
You're going to be honest with me
this time.

41:41.752 --> 41:42.836
What was I before?

41:42.836 --> 41:45.881
You're the confidential informant,
the rat who gave up George.

41:45.881 --> 41:48.717
You're the one
who told Judicial about the hard drive.

41:48.717 --> 41:50.969
It's 'cause of you George is dead. Regina!

41:52.471 --> 41:54.348
- Just give me a second.
- Give you a second?

41:55.807 --> 41:56.642
You come to my door,

41:56.642 --> 41:59.645
- and you accuse me of betrayal.
- You told Judicial about George.

42:00.229 --> 42:02.231
- No, not them.
- No?

42:02.231 --> 42:04.900
Judicial come during the day.
They ask the easy questions.

42:04.900 --> 42:07.736
But the man who knows everything,
he comes at night.

42:09.196 --> 42:10.948
What? What are you ta--

42:19.540 --> 42:21.875
One night, I wake up,
and there's a man in my bedroom.

42:21.875 --> 42:23.877
I can't see anything.
The lamp's been unplugged.

42:23.877 --> 42:25.921
And he tells me to not move.

42:25.921 --> 42:27.506
He wants me to tell him everything.

42:27.506 --> 42:30.884
- To give up everybody, not just George.
- Regina, what do you--

42:30.884 --> 42:33.887
For every one question I wouldn't answer,
he'd threaten two people I loved.

42:33.887 --> 42:38.392
Two people I loved. My friends, my family.

42:39.560 --> 42:40.894
If I left the apartment,

42:40.894 --> 42:43.146
he'd turn up at night
at the foot of my bed in the darkness,

42:43.146 --> 42:46.483
and he would recite the names of everyone
that I had talked to that day.

42:46.984 --> 42:48.402
Everyone I had talked to.

42:49.319 --> 42:50.737
If I had visitors--

42:52.197 --> 42:56.076
Look, I put these up to block the sound.
I don't know if it works.

42:56.785 --> 42:59.204
- Even with them, he may hear every word.
- Who is "he"?

42:59.204 --> 43:00.873
Regina, who are you talking about?

43:00.873 --> 43:04.626
They know how to get to you.
They know what you fear.

43:06.920 --> 43:07.921
My mother...

43:10.549 --> 43:14.303
every name I gave that man was another day
she didn't have to spend in the mines.

43:15.012 --> 43:18.974
So yeah, I gave up
the names of every relic dealer I knew.

43:23.020 --> 43:26.732
That's why Kennedy gave me your name.
Because he knew Judicial already had it.

43:29.067 --> 43:31.361
Well, hopefully they all know
so they'll stay away from here.

43:31.361 --> 43:34.489
- But if you cared for George--
- He only cared about himself.

43:34.489 --> 43:37.659
Hey, George is dead
'cause you gave up his name.

43:37.659 --> 43:40.454
He is dead
'cause he didn't give up the hard drive.

43:40.454 --> 43:42.247
The fucking hard drive.

43:43.415 --> 43:45.834
- Regina, what's on the hard drive?
- Don't ask.

43:46.960 --> 43:48.712
What's on the drive?

43:51.798 --> 43:52.799
I never saw.

44:04.311 --> 44:06.021
He never really cared about me.

44:08.190 --> 44:09.775
He used me to get it for him.

44:11.276 --> 44:12.611
Probably did the same to you,

44:12.611 --> 44:14.571
pretending to love you
to get what he wanted.

44:17.366 --> 44:18.534
I didn't give it to him.

44:19.993 --> 44:21.787
Then he gave me something from his mother.

44:23.330 --> 44:24.748
The only thing he kept of hers.

44:26.750 --> 44:27.793
What did he give you?

44:31.880 --> 44:36.552
These things, these objects, all this...

44:38.971 --> 44:40.222
stuff.

44:44.726 --> 44:46.770
Because of it, I have nothing.

44:52.442 --> 44:53.819
I have no one.

45:01.243 --> 45:04.621
I'm sure the hard drive's been destroyed,

45:04.621 --> 45:08.792
so I don't think
they're gonna disturb you anymore.

45:09.793 --> 45:11.211
Neither will I, so...

45:24.683 --> 45:25.684
Hey...

45:28.478 --> 45:30.397
what did George give up
for the hard drive?

45:30.397 --> 45:32.149
You said he gave you something.

45:34.526 --> 45:36.028
What is it?

45:36.028 --> 45:37.738
It's everything.

45:39.948 --> 45:41.825
I don't think they know it exists.

45:44.286 --> 45:46.246
They search and toss my place.

45:46.246 --> 45:51.043
They look under the mat,
but they just toss the damn thing aside.

46:00.802 --> 46:01.803
What is that?

46:01.803 --> 46:07.142
This is a gift from George's mother,
given to him by his aunt, Gloria.

46:07.142 --> 46:10.145
This was passed down
and hidden for generations.

46:10.145 --> 46:12.523
Is this before the rebellion?

46:13.315 --> 46:17.528
Was before the Silo.
Before there was a reason to lie.

46:25.410 --> 46:28.747
When you see what you'll see,
don't speak it out loud.

46:29.414 --> 46:30.624
Don't let them hear.

46:32.459 --> 46:35.087
This will get you killed.

49:12.995 --> 49:14.413
You have to wake him up.

49:15.998 --> 49:18.166
But it's the middle of the night.

49:18.166 --> 49:20.919
I know, but he has to see this.

49:22.796 --> 49:23.797
Now.
