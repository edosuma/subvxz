(Birds chirp)

00:02.669 --> 00:04.936
- Family!
I have exciting news!

00:06.940 --> 00:09.041
Oh Good. David,
I'd hoped you were home.

00:09.076 --> 00:10.475
- Thanks.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.210
- You're aware of
the extraordinary work

00:12.245 --> 00:14.746
of New York-Based photographer
Sebastien Raine?

00:16.583 --> 00:18.350
- You mean my Ex?

00:18.385 --> 00:21.086
- When did you date
Sebastien Raine?

00:21.121 --> 00:22.354
- They dated for like
a month and a half

00:22.389 --> 00:24.423
and David got very upset
about it.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.358
- Okay, It was
almost three months.

00:26.393 --> 00:27.959
Four, if you include
the month

00:27.994 --> 00:29.261
that he was seeing
other people.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.163
And you met him through me.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.631
- That's nonsense.

00:32.666 --> 00:35.200
I met Sebastien Raine
at an art opening years ago.

00:35.235 --> 00:36.668
- At my gallery.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.170
And can you please
stop saying his full name.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.505
He's a monster, who uses people,

00:40.540 --> 00:42.407
and leaves them for dead.
- Yeah.

00:42.442 --> 00:44.409
- I hate to play contrarian,
David, but The Times and I,

00:44.444 --> 00:47.145
both consider Sebastien Raine
a dear friend.

00:47.180 --> 00:48.513
- Remember when he dumped you?

00:48.548 --> 00:50.115
And you ate all those mall
pretzels,

00:50.150 --> 00:51.716
and watched
"Bridget Jones's Diary"

00:51.751 --> 00:53.418
every day for a year.

00:53.453 --> 00:55.587
- It wasn't a whole year,

00:55.622 --> 00:58.623
And I will not feel shame
about the mall pretzels.

00:58.658 --> 01:01.259
- Okay, that's enough
news for today.

01:02.696 --> 01:03.895
- Um no, what about him?

01:06.266 --> 01:08.333
- He's coming here.

01:08.368 --> 01:09.868
- What? Wha-- Why?

01:11.438 --> 01:13.405
- Sebastien Raine wants to
collaborate on a project.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.006
With me.

01:15.041 --> 01:16.575
And you his commitment
to his work.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.243
He's willing to
come all the way here.

01:18.278 --> 01:20.212
When flying me to New York
would be a lot easier.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.114
And a welcome escape.

01:22.149 --> 01:24.182
But Sebastien Raine
puts his subjects first.

01:24.217 --> 01:26.418
And he told me
I must respect that.

01:26.453 --> 01:28.120
- Okay. You know what?
I don't care.

01:28.155 --> 01:29.754
So you can do whatever you like.

01:29.789 --> 01:31.123
- I could cancel,

01:31.158 --> 01:32.457
but you've just told me
you don't care

01:32.492 --> 01:33.825

but to meet him.

He's most likely wearing

girlfriend.

02:43.597 --> 02:47.265
- No...
- No. No, I own The Motel,

02:47.300 --> 02:49.734
so that makes me more
like your landlord?

02:49.769 --> 02:51.069

- Okay. It's just, I thought my
community service hours

05:14.214 --> 05:15.513
would apply but they
don't count

05:15.548 --> 05:17.482
because their court-ordered.
So...

05:17.517 --> 05:19.751
- Yeah, I think the whole point
of volunteering

05:19.786 --> 05:22.387
is to give something back,
right?

05:22.422 --> 05:23.755

I give back

both at my place,

uh... around seven.

someone else's world.

07:23.376 --> 07:24.776

at the motel.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.880
- At the motel?

07:28.915 --> 07:31.483
And here I thought
I gave you

07:31.518 --> 07:33.384
very specific instructions

07:33.419 --> 07:35.487
to go directly to the cafe.

07:35.522 --> 07:36.921
Ever the renegade.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.290

it was probably best

07:39.325 --> 07:40.692

08:03.449 --> 08:05.717
This is my talk now,
shoot later look.

for-for the moment.

08:10.757 --> 08:12.590
- Don't worry, I'm just using
you for scale.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.425
It's this backdrop.

08:14.460 --> 08:17.061

romanticism to all this,

08:17.096 --> 08:18.796
that's just...

08:20.266 --> 08:21.799

to stand in the way

08:25.071 --> 08:26.771
of your inspiration.

08:26.806 --> 08:29.841
- Well, why don't you actually

- In my defence, I didn't
believed any of this, Bob.

18:45.391 --> 18:47.525
(Foot tapping)
Gwen is very trustworthy.

18:47.560 --> 18:48.926
- Ray, you're tapping
your foot.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.427
- Okay.

18:52.665 --> 18:56.333
♪ ♪

18:56.368 --> 18:58.102
(Kicking thud)

18:58.137 --> 19:00.237
(Door opens)

19:00.272 --> 19:02.373
- Moira
- Good morning, Sebastien.

19:02.408 --> 19:05.509
I was up all night evaluating
our little project

19:05.544 --> 19:07.811
and I've come to the
unfortunate conclusion

19:07.846 --> 19:11.382
that you may have
misrepresented your intentions.

19:11.417 --> 19:14.351
- I wanted to capture
the real Moira Rose.

19:14.386 --> 19:17.087
Does the real Moira Rose
live in a studio?

19:17.122 --> 19:18.455
Or the Palazzo?

19:18.490 --> 19:20.424
- I have. And I will again.

19:20.459 --> 19:23.060
If you're planning to
capitalize on those images--

19:23.095 --> 19:25.062
- You just have to trust me.

19:25.097 --> 19:26.630
With this work you will,
once again,

19:26.665 --> 19:29.533
sit atop the summit
of cultural conversation,

19:29.568 --> 19:32.169
with your inspired unfettering.

19:32.204 --> 19:33.704
- Oh, I'd love to believe you,

19:33.739 --> 19:37.074
but there's a big fat line
between charm and bullshit.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.610
- Give me your camera.
(Door opens)

19:39.645 --> 19:41.679
David?!

19:41.714 --> 19:45.416
- Um, yes Sebastien and I
just had some um,

19:45.451 --> 19:48.352
stuff that we needed
to talk about.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.254
- Well, I'm having
a hard time landing

19:50.289 --> 19:52.523
on surprise or betrayal.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.725
- Yeah, I should probably go.
So...

19:57.963 --> 20:00.197
- Give me the memory card,
Sebastien.

20:00.232 --> 20:02.733
- Moira, I'm scared for us.

20:04.236 --> 20:05.603
- Oh, you mean this memory card?

20:07.806 --> 20:09.373
Yeah, I'd give it back,

20:09.408 --> 20:11.575
but I don't think it'll be
of much use to you.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.444
It accidentally
fell out of your camera

20:13.479 --> 20:15.512
into my hand last night.

20:15.547 --> 20:18.582
And then fell out of my hand
into my drink.

20:20.119 --> 20:22.086
And then I stepped on it a lot.
So...

20:24.790 --> 20:26.757
It was really good to see you,
Sebastien.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.726
Good luck with the
rest of this project.

20:31.830 --> 20:35.366
- David, I feel terrible that
you had to do that just for me.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.201
- It wasn't just for you.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.103
Let's just say we both won.

20:41.674 --> 20:44.174
- Okay folks, we're gonna
start with something

20:44.209 --> 20:45.509
a little different tonight.

20:45.544 --> 20:47.044
The game is called crazy eights.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.179
And the diamond shaped things
are wild.

20:49.214 --> 20:50.614
- Roland, shush.

20:50.649 --> 20:52.816
- Well I'm just glad
we're back here again,

20:52.851 --> 20:55.619
and that we could put all that
unpleasantness behind us.

20:55.654 --> 20:57.755
- Gwen, these Teriyaki
meatballs they're delicious.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.891
- Wow and those sliders
look incredible.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.626
- Those aren't for you.

21:02.661 --> 21:04.461
- How's that watch
working out for you?

21:04.496 --> 21:06.797
- I love it.

21:08.233 --> 21:09.600
- Thanks.

21:09.635 --> 21:11.168
(Rolland teasing quietly)
Johnny...

21:11.203 --> 21:13.103
Johnny...
(Amused chuckle)
