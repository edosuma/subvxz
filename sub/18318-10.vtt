00:26.627 --> 00:30.797
You know, they say that
classical music is for squares.

00:30.798 --> 00:33.133
But us, classical musicians,

00:33.134 --> 00:35.768
we know how to party!

00:35.769 --> 00:37.137
And when we party,

00:37.138 --> 00:40.740
we party with Delgado's
Super Super Super salsa!

00:40.741 --> 00:43.510
In fact, my whole
family loves it!

00:43.511 --> 00:48.181
Oh, Rodrigo, you always
keep the beat.

00:48.182 --> 00:51.518
It's the salsa, mi amor.

00:51.519 --> 00:52.785
Kids!

00:52.786 --> 00:54.754
What have you got there?

00:57.158 --> 01:00.593
It's a Super Super
Super Hard Taco!

01:00.594 --> 01:03.763
- It's authentico.
- And delicious.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.132
Mmm.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.001
Super super super super

01:09.002 --> 01:12.140
super super tacos!

01:15.643 --> 01:16.643
Oh, man.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.481
What did I do?

01:20.482 --> 01:21.948
Rodrigo, we are so proud of you.

01:21.949 --> 01:23.816
What did I do?

01:23.817 --> 01:25.152
Yes we are, Maestro.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.453
I didn't know your hips
could move like that.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.155
What changed your mind?

01:28.156 --> 01:30.056
Well...

01:30.057 --> 01:31.858
I was thinking of Venice.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.860
And how La Fiamma, you know?

01:33.861 --> 01:35.962
She could give up
anything to do a concert.

01:35.963 --> 01:39.232
So I thought I could give
a little bit of self-respect.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.301
Whatever's left, this...

01:41.302 --> 01:43.270
This Chimichanga.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.771
Oh, Maestro.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.173
Yeah, I know.

01:46.174 --> 01:49.476
I'm sorry that I threw
all those things at you.

01:49.477 --> 01:50.577
Don't worry, Gloria.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.212
It's fine, that was
the fun part.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.346
And you'll be happy to know

01:53.347 --> 01:54.481
that the first check
was deposited today.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.283
- Yes.
- The first check?

01:56.284 --> 01:59.186
Yes, into the newly opened
Maestro Juan Rivera

01:59.187 --> 02:03.523
youth orchestra account
number 58732011658.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.358
Virgilio! I love you!

02:05.359 --> 02:07.660
Oh, I love you too.
Don't tell Christophe.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.929
How many commercials
do we have left to do?

02:09.930 --> 02:11.030
Only nine.

02:11.031 --> 02:12.199
- Let me do eight.
- Uh...

02:12.200 --> 02:13.766
- Um...
- Just do eight.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.535
Rodrigo, you'll survive it.
You'll survive it.

02:15.536 --> 02:16.936
We'll survive it.
We'll survive it together.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.004
Oh, Craig, get that thing.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.206
Oh, right.

02:19.207 --> 02:21.841
We have a little,
little gift for you.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.243
A little gift.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.411
Okay, but its...

02:24.412 --> 02:26.613
So this is from us....

02:26.614 --> 02:28.481
- Thank you so much, guys.
- To you.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.717
Hey, that's very nice.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.852
Okay.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.887
Ah, it's fucking red tape!

02:34.888 --> 02:36.523
Yay!

02:36.524 --> 02:37.524
It's the fucking red tape!

02:37.525 --> 02:39.226
- Yes.
- Thank you.

02:39.227 --> 02:41.229
I've got my own now.

02:44.031 --> 02:48.134
You so suck, Rutledge!

02:48.135 --> 02:51.738
You're never gonna
get the chair.

02:51.739 --> 02:56.277
Oboists from all over
the world are coming
to compete with you.

02:57.345 --> 03:00.881
Your reed-making,
it sucks!

03:02.316 --> 03:04.451
And you go cross-eyed
when you play.

03:04.452 --> 03:08.555
Your neck puffs out like a
dinosaur from Jurassic Park.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.490
The one that spits acid
all over the place.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.359
Hailey, you know what?
I gotta take a break.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.794
I gotta stop, this
is too fucking weird.

03:14.795 --> 03:17.063
But really good job not
breaking your concentration.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.798
I really...
that's impressive.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.501
Hey, before I go,
this is your money.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.370
It's your share from the
gate from the other night.

03:23.371 --> 03:25.071
Oh, awesome.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.606
It's $11.13.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.174
I mean, I'm sorry it's not more.

03:28.175 --> 03:29.342
I will frame it.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.644
I really hope I get this job.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.280
It's weird that they're
even making you audition.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.747
I mean, you know them.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.349
No, that's exactly
why it's not weird.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.717
Everybody has to audition
behind a screen

03:37.718 --> 03:38.951
so that there's no favoritism.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.487
Seems like bullshit.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.889
If I were you I would
just go in there and go,

03:42.890 --> 03:45.358
It's Hailey.

03:45.359 --> 03:48.461
You know, if you ever need
to you can move back in
with me rent free.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.763
What about B?

03:50.764 --> 03:52.865
We're taking a break.
He's got issues.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.301
I've got issues.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.202
It's cool, you know.
Fuck it.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.837
- Fuck it.
- Sorry, Lizzie.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.839
No, really, enough with
this rank self-pity shit.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.509
I mean, I was about to get
a tattoo of his ass on my ass.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.611
So really, I dodged
a bullet there.

04:04.612 --> 04:05.912
You gotta shed
your skin, you know?

04:05.913 --> 04:07.547
Yeah.

04:07.548 --> 04:10.750
I notice that you're
not dressing like
Kápralová anymore.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.051
Nope.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.687
Yeah, I kept on being
mistaken for a waitress.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.690
But I'm a club owner,
I'm like Rick from Casablanca.

04:17.690 --> 04:21.329
I'm like...
I'm like Jabba the Hutt.

04:31.972 --> 04:32.972
Hey.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.007
Hey.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.910
You're Hailey Rutledge, right?

04:37.911 --> 04:39.111
Yeah.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.547
- Have we met?
- No.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.949
But I saw you play with
the orchestra, you were great.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.751
Thanks.

04:44.752 --> 04:47.019
Arlen Lee.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.621
I've been subbing over
at the Chicago Philharmonic.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.723
Probably stupid for me
to fly out here for this, but

04:50.724 --> 04:53.225
I figured it's
a good experience, so...

04:53.226 --> 04:55.161
Why is it stupid?

04:55.162 --> 04:59.566
Well, because
you fucking destroy.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.568
Are you trying to psych me out?

05:01.569 --> 05:03.870
No, I'm more like

05:03.871 --> 05:05.839
psyching myself out.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.976
Is that a Loree Royal?

05:09.977 --> 05:13.847
Yeah. Meet Oboe Wan Kenobi.

05:15.449 --> 05:18.150
Yeah, it's early for that shit.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.388
Sorry.

05:21.389 --> 05:22.455
Oboe.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.009
That wasn't her.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.678
I don't think so.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.848
Number 17?

05:48.849 --> 05:51.518
That's me.

05:51.519 --> 05:54.488
- Break a leg.
- Thanks, you too.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.737
Hey, hey.

06:10.738 --> 06:11.839
Hey!

07:33.053 --> 07:34.887
Hi.

07:34.888 --> 07:35.955
You came.

07:35.956 --> 07:39.058
Well, it's been a long
time since I had

07:39.059 --> 07:41.761
a late night text
from Constanze.

07:41.762 --> 07:44.697
Um, could I have a
sparkling water with lemon?

07:44.698 --> 07:46.265
Still not drinking?

07:46.266 --> 07:47.266
No.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.901
You? You off the pills?

07:48.902 --> 07:50.670
They don't seem to
work so well anymore.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.239
Nothing really works.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.041
So I'm going to
get an operation.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.308
Good.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.644
That is great news.

07:57.645 --> 08:00.246
You know, they can do
marvels nowadays.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.881
Let's hope.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.282
Yeah.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.384
So, um, you and Gloria.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.419
Is it serious?

08:07.420 --> 08:09.221
Well, let's hope
it's not terminal.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.992
You have a unique
way of bridging

08:12.993 --> 08:14.762
the player-management divide.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.565
Here you go, sir.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.567
I have a question.

08:20.568 --> 08:21.801
How good could I have been?

08:21.802 --> 08:24.571
If I'd gone a different route?

08:24.572 --> 08:26.105
If I'd tried to be a soloist,

08:26.106 --> 08:27.807
instead of an orchestra member.

08:27.808 --> 08:30.309
Well, tried wouldn't
have come into it.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.410
You could have had
a wonderful career.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.746
How good?

08:34.748 --> 08:37.448
How good could I have been?

08:37.450 --> 08:39.251
Well, not Yo-Yo Ma good.

08:39.251 --> 08:41.153
But...

08:41.154 --> 08:43.455
I'd say Andrew Walsh good.

08:43.456 --> 08:44.791
Yes. Definitely.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.726
You could have been
the female Andrew Walsh

08:46.727 --> 08:49.596
If you'd kept your head down
and just gone for it.

08:49.597 --> 08:51.097
Honestly, I don't know
why you didn't.

08:51.098 --> 08:54.801
I mean, I could never
understand.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.036
You know the moment
I first heard you,

08:57.037 --> 08:58.971
what was it, 20 years
ago in Birmingham,

08:58.972 --> 09:03.442
I thought: fuck me,
this girl is good.

09:03.443 --> 09:07.179
With your looks,
you could have had
a recording contract

09:07.180 --> 09:09.248
any day of the week.

09:09.249 --> 09:12.084
I just, I liked being
part of an orchestra.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.520
Yeah.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.822
I have regrets.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.991
But I don't regret it,
not really.

09:19.893 --> 09:20.761
Mm-hmm.

09:20.762 --> 09:23.630
You and I?

09:23.631 --> 09:25.197
How good could we have been?

09:26.366 --> 09:27.867
You and I?

09:27.868 --> 09:30.637
I mean, honestly, we were...

09:30.638 --> 09:33.906
a wee bit of a
disaster, weren't we?

09:33.907 --> 09:35.708
Our timing was
remarkably shitty.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.309
- But...
- Yeah.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.645
There was one area
where we were...

09:38.646 --> 09:41.914
we were always in sync.

09:41.915 --> 09:42.650
Yes.

09:42.651 --> 09:43.651
Yeah.

09:43.652 --> 09:45.953
Do you think about us sometimes?

09:51.224 --> 09:53.293
When is your surgery?

09:54.327 --> 09:56.063
In two days.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.935
I hope it goes beautifully.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.281
Ah, you still awake?

10:15.282 --> 10:17.316
Yep. You're back.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.019
I was a little concerned
that you disappeared.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.088
No, I just had
a drink with Cynthia.

10:22.089 --> 10:25.357
You know she's having surgery
in the next few days?

10:25.358 --> 10:27.526
So I think she just
wanted bucking up.

10:27.527 --> 10:30.963
Oh, you were with Cynthia
so I needn't have worried?

10:30.964 --> 10:33.800
Oh, no, that symphony is over.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.201
I'm onto a new one now.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.869
All right.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.171
Plus, you're fucking
incredible in the sack.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.440
Absolutely stellar.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.442
Well, I'm delighted. I didn't
know I was being rated.

10:43.443 --> 10:47.179
But thank you very much.
I try.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.148
You're good, too.

10:48.149 --> 10:51.251
That means a lot,
coming from you.

10:54.487 --> 11:00.026
I'm sorry I was such a bastard
when I met your parents.

11:00.027 --> 11:03.029
It just reminded me
of where I grew up.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.898
We used to take the piss
out of each other constantly.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.000
We were monstrous to each other.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.037
I think that's the way
we showed affection.

11:11.038 --> 11:14.875
Well, that, I understand.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.811
Look, Thomas.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.180
I've been married four times.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.649
I don't want to get
married again, but

11:23.650 --> 11:25.985
I also...

11:25.986 --> 11:28.287
I... I don't want
to get my heart broken.

11:28.288 --> 11:31.657
I can work within
those parameters.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.893
And as for breaking your heart,

11:33.894 --> 11:36.829
if I let you down,

11:36.830 --> 11:39.099
I'm letting myself down.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.306
Thomas...

11:49.777 --> 11:52.779
I'd like to do something
for you now.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.947
Do you want to go upstairs?

11:54.948 --> 11:56.648
Or stay right here.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.985
I could do it right here.

11:58.986 --> 12:01.888
Do you want me to
just stand here?

12:01.889 --> 12:04.156
If you want.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.658
But... but close your eyes.

12:06.659 --> 12:07.995
Okay.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.464
Hmm. Hmm.

12:13.466 --> 12:16.936
♫ After you who ♫

12:16.937 --> 12:21.941
♫ Could supply
my sky of blue ♫

12:21.942 --> 12:25.544
♫ After you who ♫

12:25.545 --> 12:29.348
♫ Could I love ♫

12:29.349 --> 12:32.451
♫ After you... ♫

12:32.452 --> 12:34.821
Why...

12:34.822 --> 12:39.892
♫ Should I take
the time to try ♫

12:39.893 --> 12:44.563
♫ For who else
could qualify ♫

12:44.564 --> 12:48.567
♫ After you who'll ♫

12:48.568 --> 12:51.737

12:51.738 --> 12:55.274

12:58.611 --> 13:03.883
♫ For without you there ♫

13:03.884 --> 13:08.521
♫ What would I do ♫

13:09.722 --> 13:14.961
♫ I could search years ♫

13:14.962 --> 13:19.698
♫ For someone

13:19.699 --> 13:24.503

♫ After ♫

13:28.608 --> 13:34.281
♫ You ♫

13:40.420 --> 13:43.622
Oh, bloody fucking hell.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.091
Let's go to bed.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.926
Hmm.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.061
Thanks so much
for picking me up.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.196
Thank you for asking.

13:50.197 --> 13:53.365
Here's our Uber, I think.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.334
Cynthia?

13:55.335 --> 13:56.468
Bob?

13:56.469 --> 13:58.971
I'm here to pick up a Kevin?

13:58.972 --> 14:00.672
That would be me.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.141
You guys know each other?

14:02.142 --> 14:04.543
Yeah, Bob's a member
of my orchestra.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.946
And, apparently
still driving for Uber.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.981
I find it relaxes me.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.649
Uh, so, Cynthia...

14:10.650 --> 14:11.650
Did you?

14:11.651 --> 14:13.319
I did.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.320
All right.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.321
So, how'd it go?

14:15.322 --> 14:17.523
I'll know more
in a couple of weeks.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.058
All right.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.259
It's going to be okay.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.062
- It has to be.
- Yes, it does.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.531
Oh, step into my chariot.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.533
I'll take it
from here, sir.
Thank you.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.936
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sir.

14:29.937 --> 14:33.505
I'm sorry, excuse me,
but do I know you
from somewhere?

14:33.506 --> 14:34.840
Um...

14:34.841 --> 14:37.376
Yeah, I used to play basketball.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.411
Oh, cool.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.513
Me, too.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.385
Hai Lai.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.120
Hey.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.488
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.790
I hope you don't mind me
just showing up like this.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.225
I'm used to it.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.727
So we finished our last
day of auditions today.

14:55.728 --> 14:56.963
Okay.

14:56.964 --> 14:58.197
Anyone good?

14:58.198 --> 15:00.366
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Really good.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.102
But no-one was as good today
as you were yesterday.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.804
Okay, and how about yesterday?

15:05.805 --> 15:07.706
- How did I do?
- Really good.

15:07.707 --> 15:10.977
Yeah, you know.
You know you did good.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.544
You know, you were really good.

15:12.545 --> 15:13.712
I was so proud of you.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.714
You played with blood.
It was incredible.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.484
Thanks.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.721
But?

15:22.722 --> 15:27.593
Well, there's was this guy,
you know, who plays really well.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.495
A little better.

15:29.496 --> 15:32.999
He, like, played
with more blood?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.233
Just, like, blood everywhere?

15:34.234 --> 15:36.002
Bleeds all over the place?

15:36.003 --> 15:37.536
No, no, it's just
the committee, you know?

15:37.537 --> 15:39.671
Yeah, since when do you
listen to a fucking committee?

15:39.672 --> 15:40.772
Right, I know.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.008
You thought that
he played better.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.110
No, no, no, no.
I was outvoted.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.377
You should have seen it.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.812
I was... I always
know it's you.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.347
You played from
behind the screen,

15:48.348 --> 15:50.082
I could notice it was you
like a bat in a dark cave.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.118
- And I always love it
when you play.
- Who was it?

15:52.119 --> 15:53.585
- Because it's always
the best for me.
- Who was it?

15:53.586 --> 15:54.586
Who was what?

15:54.587 --> 15:55.754
Who got it?

15:55.755 --> 15:58.690
The, oh, it's this guy from...

15:58.691 --> 16:00.392
I think he's subbing
in in Chicago.

16:00.393 --> 16:03.295
Oh. Arlen.
Yep. Arlen's his name.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.198
Yeah. What a name, right?

16:06.199 --> 16:08.735
For an oboist, I mean,
that's a crazy name.

16:12.239 --> 16:19.211
Okay, well, um,
I guess that's that then.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.580
Fuck it. Thank you
for telling me in person.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.350
Hai Lai, you can always sub in.

16:24.351 --> 16:27.053
Why don't you try subbing in?

16:27.054 --> 16:28.121
Mother...

16:30.723 --> 16:32.159
Ai.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.128
Man...

16:36.129 --> 16:37.729
- Hey.
- What?

16:37.730 --> 16:39.065
Hey, I'm sorry!

16:39.066 --> 16:41.633
- I'm sorry!
- No, sorry, me.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.302
I'm sorry, Hai Lai.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.537
I'm very sorry.
Wait, where are you?

16:45.538 --> 16:46.738
Here, I'm here.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.674
Ah, yeah, I'm the one
that's sorry, Hai Lai.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.109
This is such bullshit.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.378
You know this whole
process of the auditions
and stuff for you?

16:52.379 --> 16:54.546
I mean, if there's anyone
who deserves the job,
it's you.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.948
- If you actually want it...
- If I want it?

16:56.949 --> 16:58.317
I have fucking college
loans to pay off.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.751
I need health insurance.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.421
My reputation is completely,
completely fucked

17:02.422 --> 17:03.356
since Walsh fired me.

17:03.357 --> 17:04.423
No, no, you quit.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.625
- No, I didn't quit!
- You quit.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.359
No, I can't quit, because
I'm not some magical

17:08.361 --> 17:10.529
musical superstar shaman!

17:10.530 --> 17:13.265
I'm like a fucking...
I'm an oboist, okay?

17:13.266 --> 17:15.767
I'm a fucking oboist.

17:15.768 --> 17:20.205
So how did it go?
Your whole conducting debut?

17:20.207 --> 17:22.941
It went well.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.444
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:25.944 --> 17:28.380
I'm sorry I didn't invite you.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.681
That's okay, I'm not offended.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.950
Yes, you are.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.452
A little bit, yeah, maybe.

17:33.453 --> 17:34.720
Yes.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.122
Ah, let's solve this.
Come on, let's go...

17:36.123 --> 17:38.524
Do you want to go for a walk?

17:38.525 --> 17:41.127
Um...

17:41.128 --> 17:42.828
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:42.829 --> 17:43.862
Come.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.031
You should lock up your bike.

17:46.032 --> 17:48.134
I understand, I mean,
you wanted to...

17:48.135 --> 17:49.801
You wanted to
make it your own thing.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.370
You know, you wanted it
to be your thing.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.971
Hey, Thomas didn't
invite you either.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.373
Yeah, why is that?

17:54.374 --> 17:55.941
Because you're a strong toke.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.143
- A toke?
- Yeah.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.144
- Toke?
- Yeah, like a toke.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.745
I'm, I'm not a...

17:59.746 --> 18:01.147
I'm the mellow of toke.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.581
No, you're like
the strongest toke.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.982
I'm such an
easy-going toke.

18:03.983 --> 18:06.152
I hate to break it to you.
You're the strongest toke.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.219
Play with the blood.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.220
Play with the blood.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.357
- I don't say it like that.
- Where did you get that from?

18:11.358 --> 18:12.758
- The blood?
- Yeah.

18:12.759 --> 18:13.726
What does that mean?

18:13.727 --> 18:15.427
It's, it's very specific.
You know...

18:15.428 --> 18:16.895
Is that a Maestro Rivera thing?

18:16.896 --> 18:18.764
No, it's my thing.
It's my thing.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.433
I used to practice so much
in the violin, you know,

18:21.434 --> 18:22.934
so much, so much that
I got blisters on my fingers,

18:22.935 --> 18:24.170
and then, you know?

18:24.171 --> 18:25.671
- Oh.
- The blood will come out.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.073
And play with the blood.
But now it's a metaphor, okay?

18:28.074 --> 18:29.608
- Whenever I tell you
to play with the blood...
- Thank you for clarifying.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.778
- Never try to open...
- Aw fuck!

18:32.779 --> 18:33.879
What, what?

18:33.880 --> 18:36.815
I fucking blew it,
I fucking blew the audition.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.484
No, you were great, Hailey.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.718
Yeah, but he was
fucking better than me.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.453
I fucking suck.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.922
- You fucking suck?
- You're the best or
you fucking suck.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.191
Whoa, Hailey, no, wait, no.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.625
Don't say those things, okay?

18:46.626 --> 18:48.660
I mean, look, I'm not
even good sometimes, you know?

18:48.661 --> 18:51.062
When I'm performing
a German, you know,

18:51.063 --> 18:53.599
like Beethoven or Haydn,

18:53.600 --> 18:56.202
you know, I just feel
the presence of Von Karajan

18:56.203 --> 18:59.205
going like...
you know?

18:59.206 --> 19:01.473
Or when I'm doing
Copland or Messiaen?

19:01.474 --> 19:04.243
You know, I always feel
the presence of Lenny.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.878
Like, just, smelling really bad.

19:06.879 --> 19:10.015
And he used to smile a lot,
but he doesn't smile.

19:10.016 --> 19:11.217
You know? When
I'm doing that.

19:11.218 --> 19:13.752
Or Bach. Why don't
I program Bach?

19:13.753 --> 19:15.254
Tell me.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.255
Go ahead. Why?

19:16.256 --> 19:17.356
I don't know.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.690
Because he hates
that I play him.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.426
He told me that, yeah.

19:20.427 --> 19:23.429
He told me that I
misinterpret everything
that he wrote.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.096
- He told you that.
- He told me that!

19:25.097 --> 19:28.434
He has no feelings
but apparently he says
that to everyone, but...

19:28.435 --> 19:31.069
When did these great composers
start appearing to you?

19:31.070 --> 19:33.505
When I was little...

19:33.506 --> 19:35.241
I've never said this
before but, uh,

19:35.242 --> 19:37.776
Beethoven first
came up as an elephant.

19:37.777 --> 19:38.777
A little elephant.

19:38.778 --> 19:42.981
Hai Lai, I want to
offer you a job.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.350
You need an assistant?

19:44.351 --> 19:47.152
No. No, no, I don't
need an assistant.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.854
It's not an
assistant I need, no.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.689
- No, no, no.
- You need an assistant.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.258
I think you actually
need an assistant

19:52.259 --> 19:54.125
more than anybody in
the world needs an assistant.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.527
I'm so super organized
right now.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.695
- Really?
- You have no idea, yes.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.330
I don't need
an assistant anymore.

19:58.331 --> 20:01.567
- Ask me the date.
- What's the date?

20:01.568 --> 20:03.302
- Wednesday.
- That's not a date.

20:03.303 --> 20:06.572
It's what, uh...
it's what you need to...

20:06.573 --> 20:07.873
Anyway, Hailey, no,
listen, listen.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.509
You have to help me
with the Youth Orchestra.

20:10.510 --> 20:13.279
You know, to organize
the kid's lessons, you know,

20:13.280 --> 20:15.314
to get the kids.
You have the kids touch.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.516
- And it's very important
for me to get someone...
- Rodrigo, no.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.385
- ...I can trust.
- I'm honored, thank you.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.552
But no.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.488
No. What?
Why no?

20:22.489 --> 20:24.222
Because I need to
get out of your orbit.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.957
- Professionally.
- Orbit.

20:25.958 --> 20:30.329
Don't, okay, this is
not like a gravitational
astronomical thing.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.998
All right?
I'm talking about the kids.

20:33.533 --> 20:36.001
Hai Lai, you need a job.
You need a job. Come on.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.504
I'm offering you...

20:38.371 --> 20:39.839
No, thank you.

20:40.940 --> 20:41.940
Hai Lai...

20:44.544 --> 20:47.078
Okay, we're being
very good at this, you know?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.448
I don't need to be romantically
holding it, holding it.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.984
I never hold it, so...

20:53.420 --> 20:54.354
- I think it's a good idea.
- Yeah.

20:54.355 --> 20:56.755
Just stop, stop thinking.

20:56.756 --> 20:57.889
Okay, yeah.

20:57.890 --> 21:00.058
Part of you thinks
it's a good idea?

21:01.060 --> 21:02.328
What did you say?

21:02.329 --> 21:03.829
Let's just get it over with.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.196
Where, here?

21:05.197 --> 21:08.667
Honey, I would say
your place, but

21:08.668 --> 21:09.735
you don't have a place.

21:09.736 --> 21:12.772
Because you're so disorganized.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.216
Hi, is she up yet?

21:25.217 --> 21:26.518
She's not answering her phone.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.454
I haven't seen her this morning.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.722
We have a 9 AM appointment
to get a pedicure.

21:30.723 --> 21:33.425
I'll do it for you for half of
whatever they're charging.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.627
Oh, Hai Lai.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.696
- Hi.
- Holy shit.

21:37.697 --> 21:41.266
Lizzie. And Shawn, no,
the viola player, right?

21:41.267 --> 21:43.569
Yeah, hello, Maestro.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.671
I'm in the mood for a bathroom.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.973
Did you and Hailey
sleep together last night?

21:47.974 --> 21:49.375
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we did.

21:49.376 --> 21:50.909
We did, Lizzie, yeah.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.612
But you know, we spent
more time awake.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.681
We did more things
when we were awake.
It's more fun.

21:55.682 --> 21:58.149
Oh, I just want to, um, tell you

21:58.150 --> 22:00.218
what a huge fan I am.

22:00.219 --> 22:01.987
Thanks, Shawn.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.423
Yeah.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.157
Ah!

22:06.158 --> 22:07.426
Hi.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.094
Oh my God.

22:09.095 --> 22:11.730
Okay, that's great, okay?

22:11.731 --> 22:13.131
Did you get it
out of your system?

22:13.132 --> 22:14.633
Is it out of your system?

22:14.634 --> 22:16.001
What, are you guys
like dating now?

22:16.002 --> 22:18.470
I mean, what the fuck
is going on here?

22:18.471 --> 22:20.539
Okay, I just woke up.

22:20.540 --> 22:23.274
I don't know, we're
just playing it by ear.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.510
Well, was it good?

22:24.511 --> 22:25.644
Like, 1 to 10, was it good?

22:25.645 --> 22:30.416
It's like a...
like a 9.86.

22:30.417 --> 22:31.950
Fuck.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.184
That's good.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.421
We'll call that a 10.

22:35.422 --> 22:38.156
You have really good ears.

22:38.157 --> 22:40.025
Lizzie, it's me.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.960
I've been told that
since I've been a little kid.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.829
You know, that's why I do
what I do, you know?

22:43.830 --> 22:46.465
And talking about that,
I have to go to the
auditions right now.

22:46.466 --> 22:47.699
- Okay?
- I know.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.167
So, that's it, I'm gone.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.437
Ciao.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.072
Holy shit.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.177
Ciao.

22:59.178 --> 23:00.679
- Ciao, Lizzie.
- Ciao.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.515
- Ciao, ciao.
- Bye.

25:11.578 --> 25:12.712
Hey, Warren Boyd.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.262
Welcome.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.397
Welcome to our
Youth Orchestra,
welcome!

26:06.398 --> 26:07.767
It's an honor to have you.

26:10.870 --> 26:15.140
So, uh, basically there's
a place for everybody.

26:15.141 --> 26:16.675
Yes.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.144
Next.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.924
- I started playing
harpsichord at seven.
- Ah!

26:32.925 --> 26:34.492
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

26:34.493 --> 26:36.662
I didn't realize
that anyone was there.

26:36.663 --> 26:38.396
The story of my life.

26:38.397 --> 26:42.968
You know, at first I was
the star, not my brother.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.670
Oh, okay.

26:44.671 --> 26:46.772
He used to stare
at me when I played.

26:46.773 --> 26:49.808
He idolized me.
His big sister.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.376
I was the prodigy.

26:51.377 --> 26:55.681
And then my father turned
his attentions to Wolfgang.

26:55.682 --> 26:58.049
Ah, Wolfgang.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.752
And when I reached
a marriageable age,

27:00.753 --> 27:01.953
that was it.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.422
My brilliant career
was... poof.

27:04.423 --> 27:07.425
You have a really nice costume.
I hope you have a nice day.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.829
Don't be insipid, Hailey.

27:13.265 --> 27:14.366
Have we met before?

27:16.268 --> 27:18.704
I'm Maria Anna.

27:18.705 --> 27:21.039
But my friends call me Nannerl.

27:21.040 --> 27:25.076
Nannerl, like...
like Mozart's sister?

27:25.077 --> 27:27.779
How many Nannerls
are there out there?

27:27.780 --> 27:30.415
Listen, Fraulein Rutledge,

27:30.416 --> 27:33.118
it's time to get
your schiesse together.

27:33.119 --> 27:35.320
Don't make the same
mistake I did.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.388
What was that?

27:37.389 --> 27:39.959
I gave up.

27:51.570 --> 27:53.039
Heh.
