WEBVTT

00:10.975 --> 00:13.143
-She killed him.
-You're referring to?

00:13.194 --> 00:14.570
Harper Fenn.

00:15.020 --> 00:19.607
It's a video of Harper waving
her hands about looking angry.

00:19.717 --> 00:21.938
-That could mean anything.
-Are you kidding me?

00:22.029 --> 00:23.904
Is that supposed
to be me casting a spell?

00:23.985 --> 00:26.117
Harper is not a witch.

00:26.198 --> 00:28.739
She's been certified
as non-magical by the Moot.

00:28.830 --> 00:32.162
The drunken stumble, breaks
neck theory looks unlikely.

00:32.173 --> 00:33.901
The one thing we can rule out
is magic

00:34.012 --> 00:36.786
if we bring in
an M.I., magical investigator.

00:36.827 --> 00:40.474
My son's life for your
daughter's innocence.

00:40.611 --> 00:43.580
[both laughing]

00:45.329 --> 00:46.750
Ah...

00:46.800 --> 00:50.314
[birds chirping]

00:50.995 --> 00:52.616
[laughing]

00:54.020 --> 00:58.615
[echoing laughter]

01:06.460 --> 01:07.791
[distant bell tolling]

01:07.852 --> 01:09.315
WOMAN: Good morning,
Mrs. Whithall.

01:12.060 --> 01:13.975
Hi, Amy!
How's it going?

01:19.676 --> 01:25.948
[phone ringing]

01:27.118 --> 01:29.904
Okay, so you still won't
answer my calls.

01:35.910 --> 01:37.955
ABIGAIL [voicemail]:
Look, I...

01:38.086 --> 01:41.356
didn't want it to come to this,
but if you won't help me,

01:41.417 --> 01:44.410
well, don't say
I didn't warn you.

02:10.771 --> 02:13.775
â™ª

03:10.223 --> 03:13.139
[phone ringing through]

03:13.270 --> 03:14.522
WOMAN [on phone]:
Hello, Sanctuary Reporter,

03:14.532 --> 03:15.664
how can I help you?

03:15.794 --> 03:17.347
Beryl Varley, please.

03:18.188 --> 03:21.154
-MAGGIE: What is that?
-SARAH: A satanic pentagram.

03:21.713 --> 03:23.845
-Has this happened before?
-SARAH: No.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.326
But I tend to keep
a low profile,

03:27.088 --> 03:28.938
as do most witches.

03:29.068 --> 03:31.201
So, I take it you've
no idea who did this?

03:31.331 --> 03:32.507
None.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.444
While I'm here,
I don't suppose Harper's--

03:37.494 --> 03:40.253
No, um, and I don't know
when she'll be back home.

03:42.473 --> 03:44.562
No doubt you have your
own views on parenting,

03:44.692 --> 03:46.435
but in the witch
community,

03:47.025 --> 03:48.785
we don't keep
our kids on a leash.

03:48.915 --> 03:49.986
[car door shuts]

03:51.317 --> 03:52.695
I see that.

03:58.359 --> 03:59.492
PIERRE: Hello?

04:00.793 --> 04:01.928
Have we met?

04:02.289 --> 04:03.291
Maybe.

04:04.361 --> 04:06.646
I was posted in Sanctuary
a while back.

04:07.397 --> 04:08.746
I'm DCI Knight.

04:08.847 --> 04:10.558
Have you ever
cautioned me for speeding?

04:11.198 --> 04:12.580
-You wouldn't be the first.
-[camera clicks and whirs]

04:13.350 --> 04:14.532
Pierre Martineau.

04:15.681 --> 04:17.709
You used to be married to
Bridget Paterson.

04:17.750 --> 04:20.426
Before she saw the light?
Yes, that was me.

04:20.555 --> 04:23.433
I was called to your house,
some kind of false alarm.

04:23.474 --> 04:24.510
A kid fell?

04:25.141 --> 04:26.450
That was you?

04:29.427 --> 04:31.101
Like you said,
false alarm.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.781
Make sure you catch
the scumbag who did this.

04:41.186 --> 04:43.536
[eerie music]

04:43.667 --> 04:44.941
[door opens]

04:46.161 --> 04:47.731
PIERRE: Some pretty
sick people out there.

04:48.672 --> 04:50.062
So, what's the plan?

04:51.152 --> 04:53.257
If Daniel was killed
by magic,

04:54.777 --> 04:58.689
I should be able to pick up
residual traces at the warehouse.

05:01.314 --> 05:02.773
[gulls cawing]

05:04.977 --> 05:06.766
[indistinct conversation]

05:06.837 --> 05:09.000
WOMAN 1:
Hey, that's her, isn't it?

05:09.420 --> 05:11.085
WOMAN 2:
She's the witch's daughter.

05:11.216 --> 05:12.558
MAN:
That's disgusting.

05:13.218 --> 05:14.393
[phone chimes]

05:34.762 --> 05:36.341
[vomiting and crying]

05:42.666 --> 05:44.136
[cafe doorbell jingling]

05:45.686 --> 05:47.352
Thanks so much
for offering us

05:47.392 --> 05:49.124
this interview,
Mrs. Whithall.

05:49.255 --> 05:51.749
Are you sure you wouldn't prefer
to go somewhere quieter?

05:51.779 --> 05:53.888
Quite honestly, I need to be
around people.

05:54.068 --> 05:57.620
Well, I know our readers
will appreciate a mother's perspective.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.570
And a best friend too,
I hope.

05:59.621 --> 06:00.658
Jake.

06:07.142 --> 06:09.395
MAN: Hey, witch,
do you do threesomes?

06:09.884 --> 06:11.538
[laughs]

06:19.067 --> 06:20.839
Thought I'd give
some space for Jake

06:20.899 --> 06:22.554
to share his
recollections.

06:22.675 --> 06:25.858
And I'm hearing what an
impressive young man Daniel was.

06:25.988 --> 06:27.924
Volunteering to coach
the junior teams.

06:27.975 --> 06:29.962
Oh, he was passionate about
supporting the kids.

06:29.992 --> 06:31.056
They all loved him.

06:31.076 --> 06:32.321
Everyone did.

06:32.821 --> 06:35.737
He was gutted when his training
schedule meant he couldn't continue.

06:35.868 --> 06:37.670
Such a tragic accident.

06:38.871 --> 06:40.034
Yes.

06:40.786 --> 06:41.986
Apparently.

06:42.657 --> 06:44.724
Are you suggesting
it wasn't an accident?

06:45.225 --> 06:47.053
I know for a fact
that it wasn't.

06:50.601 --> 06:53.580
RYAN: I've never met an actual
magical investigator before.

06:54.060 --> 06:56.487
Probably just as nervous
about meeting you.

06:57.106 --> 06:58.238
Really?

06:58.479 --> 06:59.631
No.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.648
Morgan Lynch,
Magical Investigator.

07:13.863 --> 07:15.328
MAGGIE:
Let's head to the warehouse.

07:23.177 --> 07:24.341
SARAH:
Won't be long.

07:24.352 --> 07:26.042
PIERRE:
Okay. Be careful.

07:32.926 --> 07:35.450
[suspenseful music]

07:57.515 --> 07:58.691
[rumbling]

08:02.216 --> 08:04.045
[crackling]

08:05.786 --> 08:07.918
[clattering]

08:08.049 --> 08:09.137
[gasps]

08:10.965 --> 08:14.195
MAGGIE: So, what we need
is for you to ascertain

08:14.266 --> 08:16.840
whether a crime was committed
here using magic.

08:22.494 --> 08:26.182
Magic is... energy.

08:26.763 --> 08:29.690
I can tune in to any emotional
or energetic imprint

08:29.731 --> 08:32.352
which might give a clue
as to intent or motive.

08:33.073 --> 08:34.162
Okay.

08:44.955 --> 08:49.917
[suspenseful music]

09:01.185 --> 09:03.540
Are you able to tell us
what you're picking up?

09:52.895 --> 09:54.810
[whooshing]

10:10.608 --> 10:13.089
MORGAN: [indistinct]
...get it off...

10:22.054 --> 10:24.274
[Thunder rumbling]

10:30.541 --> 10:32.935
So, you can't say for sure
what you were dealing with?

10:38.161 --> 10:40.587
All I know
is it was something

10:41.328 --> 10:45.513
so powerful, it's what pulled
the witch away, thankfully,

10:45.974 --> 10:47.385
or they'd have caught me.

10:47.705 --> 10:48.946
Did they see you?

10:49.466 --> 10:50.804
Sensed me.

10:51.955 --> 10:55.726
But then some deeper magic
way more powerful kicked in,

10:55.756 --> 10:57.221
and that's what
they keyed into.

11:00.877 --> 11:03.610
You... need to
take it easy.

11:04.141 --> 11:05.240
No.

11:05.620 --> 11:08.972
What I need...
is an explanation.

11:09.262 --> 11:10.521
Stay here.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.353
SARAH: Pierre!

11:44.061 --> 11:45.633
That was dark magic.

11:46.053 --> 11:48.012
[wind gusting]

11:54.980 --> 11:56.182
Where is everyone?

11:57.253 --> 11:58.841
Drinks at the pub,
I think.

11:59.191 --> 12:00.646
Someone's retiring?

12:01.886 --> 12:03.288
You might wanna be next.

12:03.658 --> 12:04.942
Too right.

12:05.202 --> 12:06.852
After what happened
this morning.

12:07.572 --> 12:09.027
I thought I knew
what magic was,

12:09.098 --> 12:10.702
but that thing
at the warehouse--

12:10.763 --> 12:14.073
The work of a very powerful
witch, according to Morgan.

12:14.753 --> 12:17.912
So, do they think they could
identify the witch who cast the spell?

12:18.443 --> 12:21.556
No, they had no sense
of what its source might be.

12:24.005 --> 12:26.007
Well, we know
it's not Sarah.

12:26.138 --> 12:28.348
She has a solid alibi
for that night.

12:29.358 --> 12:31.393
Could a spell
be cast remotely?

12:32.144 --> 12:33.580
Apparently not.

12:35.277 --> 12:36.975
Which makes me wonder...

12:37.305 --> 12:39.499
If there's another witch
in Sanctuary.

12:39.819 --> 12:41.455
How would we find out?

12:42.545 --> 12:44.894
Witches can detect
other witches,

12:44.975 --> 12:46.723
if they're in
close proximity.

12:46.854 --> 12:50.227
There's supposedly some kind of
shared recognition.

12:50.858 --> 12:52.581
An exchange of energy.

12:52.642 --> 12:54.122
That witch today.

12:54.253 --> 12:55.994
I'm guessing they're an MI.

12:56.254 --> 12:57.997
Can you imagine
if they caught me?

12:59.127 --> 13:01.868
The mother of the girl
accused of murder

13:01.898 --> 13:03.449
sneaking around
the crime scene?

13:03.479 --> 13:04.611
[phone chimes]

13:11.204 --> 13:12.677
MAGGIE:
[softly] Shit.

13:13.708 --> 13:15.185
The video's online.

13:15.316 --> 13:16.515
Let's get Morgan.

13:20.211 --> 13:21.771
MAGGIE:
That was quite the experience.

13:21.841 --> 13:23.022
MORGAN:
All in a day's work.

13:26.183 --> 13:27.374
Drop me here.

13:27.704 --> 13:29.412
If there is more than
one witch in Sanctuary

13:29.462 --> 13:30.874
and I can get
close enough--

13:30.955 --> 13:32.314
Could you verify
a connection

13:32.355 --> 13:33.747
to the magic we saw
at the warehouse?

13:34.007 --> 13:35.326
That would be the aim.

13:44.178 --> 13:45.821
RYAN:
Is that Jake Bolt?

13:47.785 --> 13:48.830
MAGGIE:
Wait here.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.333
Jacob.

13:52.974 --> 13:54.322
Got a minute?

13:55.143 --> 13:56.403
This sex tape.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.664
Do you have any idea
who filmed it?

13:59.145 --> 14:01.198
Yeah.
That was Dan.

14:01.582 --> 14:02.713
Dan?

14:02.844 --> 14:04.847
I mean,
he set up the camera.

14:04.977 --> 14:06.675
But it was Harper's idea.

14:07.105 --> 14:08.327
Harper?

14:08.807 --> 14:10.722
-You're certain of that?
-Yeah.

14:11.073 --> 14:14.113
'Cause Dan had dumped
Harper, right?

14:15.331 --> 14:16.991
And she wanted
to get back with him,

14:17.012 --> 14:18.503
so I guess she thought...

14:19.014 --> 14:20.661
that would do it.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.954
Was it Dan's idea
to show it at the party?

14:25.275 --> 14:26.434
Don't know.

14:26.564 --> 14:30.133
Maybe, hoping she'd
give up after that.

14:30.414 --> 14:32.353
To be fair, he just wanted
shot of her by then.

14:34.196 --> 14:36.096
Actually,
my dad said not to

14:36.676 --> 14:38.955
talk to you without
an adult present.

14:40.205 --> 14:41.449
Fair enough.

14:41.929 --> 14:43.085
Thanks for your help.

14:51.451 --> 14:53.296
Oh, you're kidding me.

14:54.462 --> 14:57.205
MICHAEL: Abigail,
what the hell have you done?

14:57.335 --> 15:01.419
This article, you need to stop
right now, this oversharing--

15:01.449 --> 15:03.229
I'm trying to protect
our son's reputation.

15:03.480 --> 15:04.853
Do you expect me
to let it get trashed?

15:04.904 --> 15:07.210
I expect you to consider
my reputation,

15:07.261 --> 15:09.510
to which we owe everything
good in our lives.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.419
-Are you sure about that?
-One hundred percent,

15:11.469 --> 15:12.717
and this is how
you thank me?

15:12.788 --> 15:14.178
Maybe you should be
thanking me.

15:14.229 --> 15:16.349
For what? For sharing
our private business

15:16.399 --> 15:18.093
with a shitty,
little tabloid?

15:18.724 --> 15:20.953
Why can't you show
some dignity?

15:21.003 --> 15:23.058
My son just died!

15:25.844 --> 15:28.471
And none of this is
going to bring him back.

15:29.617 --> 15:31.909
You need to find a way to let him go.

15:33.269 --> 15:34.415
Like you have?

15:38.063 --> 15:39.682
Maybe you're glad
he's gone.

15:40.683 --> 15:42.275
Less competition for you.

15:43.055 --> 15:44.176
[gasps]

15:46.792 --> 15:49.441
Never speak to me
like that again.

16:03.794 --> 16:06.112
"An eyewitness and close friend
of the deceased

16:06.143 --> 16:09.440
"alleges that Whithall's death
was due to an intentional act,

16:09.681 --> 16:12.498
"that the fire which broke out
was started deliberately,

16:12.799 --> 16:15.501
and that witchcraft
was definitely used."

16:15.562 --> 16:17.851
What the actual fuck, Ted?

16:17.982 --> 16:21.479
Your son, the only witness,
whose testimony

16:21.540 --> 16:25.135
we agreed not to disclose,
is now talking to the press,

16:25.175 --> 16:26.850
presumably behind your back,

16:26.860 --> 16:29.249
putting the whole
investigation at risk.

16:30.639 --> 16:31.996
I don't know, Mags.

16:32.276 --> 16:34.472
Other than maybe
he got tired of waiting

16:34.513 --> 16:37.924
for there to be some
actual progress.

16:39.526 --> 16:42.921
Ted, if Jake is correct,

16:43.231 --> 16:46.629
then we have a teenage girl,
a resident of this town,

16:46.679 --> 16:49.207
guilty of murder
by unnatural means,

16:49.277 --> 16:51.559
which incredibly,
in this day and age,

16:51.620 --> 16:54.175
still carries
the death penalty.

16:55.136 --> 16:56.543
But that's the law, Mags.

16:56.774 --> 16:58.882
And isn't it our job
to uphold it?

16:59.503 --> 17:02.159
Unless you don't have
the stomach for it.

17:05.102 --> 17:10.579
What I have is the word
of a traumatized kid and a shaky video.

17:10.601 --> 17:13.070
What I don't have
is any record

17:13.093 --> 17:16.615
held by any authority that
Harper Fenn is a witch.

17:19.784 --> 17:22.451
And, uh,
my name isn't Mags,

17:22.652 --> 17:24.952
it's Detective Chief
Inspector Knight,

17:25.021 --> 17:27.002
and should there be
any confusion,

17:27.113 --> 17:29.494
I'm the lead investigator
on this case.

17:31.420 --> 17:32.593
[door shuts]

17:45.314 --> 17:46.539
Custard donut?

17:47.169 --> 17:48.248
Gross.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.136
But yes.

17:53.505 --> 17:56.307
If there was another witch
in Sanctuary, I'd know.

17:56.428 --> 17:58.672
And if one came e in just
to murder Dan, though,

17:58.732 --> 18:02.210
who would and why, then why
would they hang around?

18:06.264 --> 18:07.436
PIERRE:
What the fuck?

18:13.621 --> 18:15.406
[dramatic music]

18:20.280 --> 18:21.413
[phone chiming]

18:36.906 --> 18:38.125
[sighs]
Oh...

18:40.302 --> 18:41.384
The MI?

18:41.824 --> 18:42.941
[phone chiming]

18:44.941 --> 18:45.944
Let's go.

18:46.034 --> 18:47.326
Bridget wants us.

18:57.022 --> 18:58.188
Thank you.

18:58.319 --> 19:01.260
Thank you.
I just really needed to see you.

19:01.330 --> 19:02.526
What's happened?

19:03.487 --> 19:05.407
It was Michael,
he was vile.

19:05.438 --> 19:08.068
I actually thought
he was going to choke me.

19:08.478 --> 19:10.244
I didn't know
who to turn to, I...

19:10.375 --> 19:12.813
It's so lonely at home now,
I just...

19:12.943 --> 19:16.046
I just needed
to see your face.

19:19.869 --> 19:21.064
I'm...

19:23.138 --> 19:26.579
I miss you,
and sometimes I wonder

19:26.619 --> 19:27.741
if you miss me too,
given how much--

19:27.871 --> 19:29.668
We agreed to walk away.

19:30.439 --> 19:31.663
I didn't agree.

19:32.583 --> 19:35.515
I never wanted to,
and in my heart,

19:35.545 --> 19:37.185
I don't believe
you did, either.

19:37.715 --> 19:39.537
Well, try and
believe it, Abigail.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.769
I love Julia.

19:42.886 --> 19:44.888
But you told me
you loved me, you,

19:45.019 --> 19:48.172
you begged me to leave Michael,
and then suddenly we're done.

19:49.353 --> 19:51.242
-What happened?
-I don't know.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.193
It wasn't about you.

19:53.283 --> 19:54.594
But it is about me!

19:55.424 --> 19:57.003
You just abandoned me,

19:57.023 --> 19:59.537
and now Dan is gone,
what do I have to live for?

20:00.427 --> 20:02.610
I'm sorry, Abigail.

20:09.305 --> 20:11.699
[birds chirping]

20:22.840 --> 20:24.929
MAN [laughing]:
Hey, look, look, look.

20:25.310 --> 20:27.396
Hey... [indistinct]Slut.

20:27.486 --> 20:29.238
[laughter]

20:38.430 --> 20:40.598
BRIDGET:
I took every copy I could find,

20:40.679 --> 20:42.226
but they'll be
all over town by now.

20:45.515 --> 20:48.213
What the hell must Abi think,
reading this shit?

20:48.344 --> 20:51.129
Surely, she can call
and set the record straight.

20:51.260 --> 20:53.101
Have you talked
to her lately?

20:54.781 --> 20:55.831
Have you?

20:56.251 --> 20:57.575
To be honest, yes.

20:58.486 --> 21:00.752
She asked me and Julia
to take a side.

21:01.823 --> 21:02.925
Against me?

21:03.265 --> 21:04.457
Why did she ask that?

21:05.398 --> 21:07.045
Because she's not
thinking straight.

21:07.625 --> 21:12.234
The grief, it's sent her
totally off the rails, so this article,

21:12.304 --> 21:14.676
I actually think
it's down to her.

21:15.016 --> 21:17.252
She loves you,
you're her closest friend.

21:17.302 --> 21:19.615
And that's what I keep
holding onto,

21:19.786 --> 21:21.378
except I can't,

21:21.719 --> 21:23.219
because I know
what this is.

21:24.239 --> 21:25.391
It's blackmail.

21:25.471 --> 21:27.218
I know how hurt you are,
but she--

21:27.279 --> 21:30.297
She asked me,
the other night...

21:33.165 --> 21:35.044
...to bring Daniel
back to life.

21:35.374 --> 21:36.405
What?

21:36.686 --> 21:37.873
Jeez.

21:38.243 --> 21:40.402
"Daniel's life for
Harper's innocence,"

21:40.462 --> 21:41.833
that's what she said.

21:42.154 --> 21:44.989
And I told her if there was
any way I could,

21:45.019 --> 21:46.832
I'd do it,
but what she's asking--

21:46.883 --> 21:47.956
It's impossible.

21:48.006 --> 21:49.369
Yes, yes! Thank you!

21:49.429 --> 21:50.582
Is it, though?

21:50.873 --> 21:52.891
I mean,
you did it before.

21:54.122 --> 21:55.751
No, no, Bridge.

21:55.881 --> 21:57.743
That time,
he was barely gone.

21:57.763 --> 22:00.070
Hmm, there was no pulse,
there was no heartbeat.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.523
He'd only just passed.

22:02.593 --> 22:05.118
It was minutes,
and even then,

22:05.589 --> 22:06.919
I should never
have done it.

22:07.140 --> 22:09.166
It's against every law
there's ever been.

22:09.296 --> 22:11.481
But all of you begged me,
and I did it out of love.

22:11.522 --> 22:13.133
Then why can't you
do it again?

22:14.493 --> 22:15.868
Because it's way too late.

22:15.999 --> 22:18.828
Christ's sake, Bridge,
he's in the fucking ground.

22:18.958 --> 22:22.048
Yeah, and all her begging,
pleading, threatening...

22:22.788 --> 22:28.451
Please, you have to help me
help her to let him go.

22:30.448 --> 22:31.580
[phone chiming]

22:36.198 --> 22:37.387
I need to go home.

23:00.871 --> 23:02.735
Donuts always help,
don't they?

23:03.656 --> 23:05.092
REPORTER:
So, just to be clear,

23:05.223 --> 23:07.791
when you say vital
evidence was hushed up--

23:07.921 --> 23:10.658
Footage filmed the night
Daniel Whithall died

23:10.699 --> 23:13.710
strongly suggests that
witchcraft was at play.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.710
REPORTER:
Can you confirm that Sarah Fenn,

23:15.760 --> 23:17.709
Sanctuary's witch,
and her daughter Harper,

23:17.749 --> 23:20.152
have been named as
persons of interest?

23:20.403 --> 23:21.587
No comment.

23:21.718 --> 23:23.982
And when can we expect progress
in this investigation?

23:24.503 --> 23:25.982
I really wish I knew.

23:26.263 --> 23:29.029
Sadly, and it
pains me to say this,

23:29.160 --> 23:31.859
but I have no confidence
in the way it's being run.

23:31.990 --> 23:34.355
So, as of now, I'll be
taking a period of leave

23:34.386 --> 23:37.648
to support my son Jacob,
and the Whithall family.

23:37.778 --> 23:40.128
-Thank you.
-Yes. Oh, um, well...

23:40.259 --> 23:41.697
Don't take it personally.

23:41.758 --> 23:42.870
How is it not personal?

23:43.001 --> 23:44.089
[phone chimes]

23:45.830 --> 23:47.396
MAGGIE:
Shit, just what I need.

23:47.527 --> 23:48.995
My boss is in town.

23:50.218 --> 23:51.705
Interesting town.

23:51.836 --> 23:52.911
How'd it go?

23:53.272 --> 23:54.459
RYAN:
Find anything useful?

23:55.840 --> 23:57.538
Nothing I didn't
already know.

23:59.234 --> 24:00.465
SARAH: Harper?

24:00.816 --> 24:02.107
HARPER:
I'm here.

24:08.788 --> 24:09.887
What is it?

24:11.638 --> 24:13.672
More stupid accusations?

24:14.492 --> 24:15.598
Ignore them.

24:15.959 --> 24:17.209
You've nothing to hide.

24:17.339 --> 24:20.415
Tell that to DCI Knight
and Beryl Varley.

24:21.755 --> 24:22.868
Yes.

24:23.208 --> 24:24.700
It's outrageous.

24:26.563 --> 24:28.438
Abigail could put
a stop to it.

24:28.569 --> 24:30.362
All she needs is to go
to the press and--

24:30.412 --> 24:31.606
Abi?

24:31.877 --> 24:33.165
What's Abi
got to do with it?

24:34.878 --> 24:36.148
She's lost it.

24:38.013 --> 24:40.262
The stuff she's been
saying...

24:41.887 --> 24:43.192
...asking.

24:43.803 --> 24:45.853
She wants me
to use magic.

24:47.806 --> 24:49.201
To do what?

24:50.657 --> 24:51.873
Bring Daniel back.

24:52.724 --> 24:54.503
Oh, my--
is she insane?

24:55.074 --> 24:57.380
Doesn't she know that you'd
go to prison for life,

24:57.511 --> 24:59.643
and that you'd be banned
from using magic ever again?

24:59.934 --> 25:01.970
Don't ever bring him back!

25:04.561 --> 25:06.118
He deserves to be dead.

25:06.999 --> 25:08.124
Why?

25:09.174 --> 25:10.191
Harper?

25:11.481 --> 25:13.136
Why does he deserve to--

25:18.602 --> 25:19.878
He raped me.

25:22.006 --> 25:25.920
And Sanctuary's got no fucking
idea what he's really like.

25:27.001 --> 25:29.121
They're all breaking their
hearts over this idol,

25:29.182 --> 25:30.811
and he's actually a psycho.

25:31.372 --> 25:33.075
He raped me,
and he filmed it,

25:33.125 --> 25:34.869
and now the video's
on the Internet.

25:37.900 --> 25:40.917
[pop music playing
in video on phone]

25:40.998 --> 25:43.630
It's pretty cool entertainment
for a party, isn't it?

25:44.080 --> 25:45.764
Up on the wall
for everyone to see.

25:46.735 --> 25:47.985
Me being a slut.

25:48.985 --> 25:50.347
Oh, and that soundtrack--

25:50.748 --> 25:54.032
happy clappy pop so you can't
hear what I'm actually saying.

25:59.835 --> 26:01.154
I don't understand.

26:03.278 --> 26:04.365
How could this...?

26:04.406 --> 26:07.277
About a month ago,
I ended things with Dan.

26:10.073 --> 26:12.380
I did it quietly,
so he wouldn't lose face.

26:15.721 --> 26:18.700
His mates gave him stick for it,
but he got off with Bea,

26:18.731 --> 26:20.639
so I thought
he'd moved on.

26:20.770 --> 26:21.817
With Bea?

26:22.227 --> 26:24.034
Turned out to be
a one-off thing, but...

26:26.907 --> 26:30.127
About a week later
at this rugby party,

26:30.178 --> 26:31.754
he asked me
to go back with him.

26:33.255 --> 26:35.306
Said he'd only got with Bea
to make me jealous.

26:35.437 --> 26:37.947
I said,
"No, we're done."

26:38.387 --> 26:39.493
Was he mad?

26:39.824 --> 26:42.391
No.
He actually apologized.

26:45.969 --> 26:47.703
He said, "Let's be
grown up about this,"

26:47.764 --> 26:49.451
and then he went off
to get us some drinks.

26:49.581 --> 26:50.734
DANIEL:
There you go.

26:50.774 --> 26:52.846
Here's to being
just good friends.

26:52.976 --> 26:56.111
[glasses clink, background
conversations and music playing]

26:56.701 --> 26:57.773
Ugh!

26:57.843 --> 26:59.595
-All right?
-That is not good.

26:59.665 --> 27:01.464
-[laughs]
-Yeah?

27:01.594 --> 27:04.090
-Okay? Yeah?
-Yeah.

27:11.992 --> 27:13.847
FREDDIE [muffled]:
I thought you two broke up.

27:14.607 --> 27:16.261
DANIEL [muffled]:
Does it look like we broke up?

27:18.904 --> 27:20.733
DALE [muffled]:
Dan, is she okay?

27:21.094 --> 27:22.667
DANIEL: It's all good,
mate, I've got it.

27:22.718 --> 27:24.139
She just needs to lie down.

27:53.517 --> 27:55.519
[weakly]
Dan-- I don't want--

28:09.620 --> 28:11.172
Afterwards,
I just lay there.

28:16.714 --> 28:18.713
I know I should have
told you,

28:19.673 --> 28:22.601
and the police,
but I just...

28:22.692 --> 28:26.200
I knew what they'd say,
and what he'd say.

28:26.390 --> 28:28.334
"She agreed to everything.

28:28.465 --> 28:30.810
The sex,
and the tape, party."

28:32.382 --> 28:34.225
I avoided him
for a week,

28:36.465 --> 28:39.507
and then I tried to talk
to him at the warehouse.

28:41.779 --> 28:43.612
He just walked away.

28:47.112 --> 28:48.639
And then someone
played the tape

28:48.660 --> 28:51.187
of what he'd done to me
in front of everyone.

28:52.707 --> 28:54.709
[crying]

28:58.104 --> 28:59.508
[sobbing]

29:05.143 --> 29:07.770
So, I didn't wanna pre-empt
your findings this morning,

29:07.800 --> 29:09.885
but now you've confirmed
that magic was used,

29:09.915 --> 29:11.628
can I get your
opinion on something?

29:12.049 --> 29:14.691
This was shot by one of
the kids at the party.

29:14.731 --> 29:16.470
[clamoring in video]

29:17.621 --> 29:18.646
That's it?

29:19.157 --> 29:21.518
This is the girl who's been
accused of bewitching the boy

29:21.559 --> 29:23.303
-to fall to his death?
-Right.

29:23.734 --> 29:26.161
In our craft,
if hand movements are used,

29:26.232 --> 29:29.043
they're fluid,
controlled, precise.

29:29.284 --> 29:32.357
There's no way they look wild
and erratic, like this.

29:32.447 --> 29:34.385
She just looks angry.

29:34.456 --> 29:36.874
RYAN: So, some other
interference,

29:37.044 --> 29:40.389
magical or otherwise, if you
had to hazard any theories?

29:40.510 --> 29:43.730
My job is solely to confirm the
presence or absence of magic.

29:43.770 --> 29:46.947
If present, ideally to identify
the witch, but in this case,

29:46.977 --> 29:49.850
whoever cast the spell
managed to obliterate

29:49.901 --> 29:51.680
any magical fingerprint.

30:08.111 --> 30:10.527
It's Anna Dao, Brit News.
Could we have a chat?

30:11.048 --> 30:12.833
Harper, if you're
in there, we'd love

30:12.883 --> 30:14.653
to help you tell
your side of the story.

30:19.083 --> 30:21.146
We'll be right outside
if you change your mind.

30:21.826 --> 30:23.496
I'll leave my card.

30:23.986 --> 30:25.411
They'll soon get bored.

30:26.421 --> 30:27.904
But for now, stay inside,

30:29.375 --> 30:31.055
at least 'til I've
talked to Abi.

30:34.113 --> 30:35.419
So, you'll go there,

30:36.770 --> 30:40.056
and tell her what her
perfect son's really like?

30:44.440 --> 30:46.469
That's not a good idea.

30:51.393 --> 30:52.407
Why?

30:53.917 --> 30:55.889
Because we need her
to cooperate,

just 'til you're
in the clear.

30:59.949 --> 31:03.594
So...
I'm the victim,

31:04.014 --> 31:06.110
but I'm the one that
needs to keep quiet,

31:06.930 --> 31:09.312
while you beg Abi to tell
everyone that I'm innocent?

31:09.373 --> 31:10.732
That's not what
I'm saying.

31:11.283 --> 31:13.462
"Oh, thank you, Abi,
for letting me off the hook

31:13.513 --> 31:14.809
"for something
I didn't do,

31:15.089 --> 31:17.378
and in return we'll save your
precious Dan's holy name."

31:17.419 --> 31:18.918
Well, you must see
the mood she's in.

31:19.549 --> 31:22.785
If you attack Dan,
she'll go for you even harder.

31:22.805 --> 31:25.035
She is going for me, Mum!

31:25.735 --> 31:27.415
And you're just
letting her!

31:29.128 --> 31:31.478
Why am I even surprised?

31:31.718 --> 31:33.030
That's what you do,
isn't it?

31:34.350 --> 31:35.886
Don't fight back,
don't get angry,

31:35.917 --> 31:37.136
-just be a good little witch.
-No, that's--

31:37.266 --> 31:39.181
that's not what this is about.

31:39.532 --> 31:43.047
Of course you go public,
once you're in the clear.

31:43.388 --> 31:44.631
Though even then...

31:47.151 --> 31:49.579
Do you know why
so few women report rape,

31:49.759 --> 31:51.298
even fewer witch women?

31:51.349 --> 31:52.482
I'm not a witch.

31:53.522 --> 31:54.823
People think you are.

31:56.374 --> 31:58.564
So, the likelihood
of you being believed and

31:59.605 --> 32:02.524
of no one assuming you're
not naturally promiscuous--

32:03.205 --> 32:04.371
Okay.

32:05.252 --> 32:06.992
No, I think you're right.

32:07.533 --> 32:09.343
I'm a murderer and a slut,

32:09.473 --> 32:10.561
and I should just keep my mouth
shut and not rock the boat.

32:10.692 --> 32:11.910
No, Harper...

32:12.041 --> 32:13.564
I'm just trying
to take care of you.

32:13.695 --> 32:15.656
Well, thank you.
I can take care of myself.

32:17.829 --> 32:19.190
[door shuts]

32:20.861 --> 32:22.760
So, will you be
reporting back to the Moot,

32:23.341 --> 32:26.025
-what you saw at the warehouse?
-I left the Moot,

32:26.086 --> 32:28.144
'cause all they want to do
is keep their heads down.

32:28.815 --> 32:32.098
The laws of this country
actively discriminate against witches,

32:32.178 --> 32:35.015
so I work with
law enforcement

32:35.056 --> 32:38.464
to ensure witches get a fighting
chance of being treated fairly.

32:40.194 --> 32:41.324
Good luck.

32:42.705 --> 32:44.300
-Bye.
-Thanks.

32:45.520 --> 32:47.354
MAGGIE: So, now we know
it wasn't Harper.

32:47.414 --> 32:49.530
Which tallies with
what Sarah said.

32:49.601 --> 32:52.066
But magic was
definitely used,

32:52.176 --> 32:55.459
and Sarah Fenn is the only
registered witch in Sanctuary.

32:56.519 --> 32:58.899
But why would she wanna harm her
daughter's boyfriend,

32:58.900 --> 33:00.872
the son of one of
her closest friends?

33:00.972 --> 33:02.204
The sex tape?

33:02.234 --> 33:04.776
Jake said it was Dan who wanted
it shown at the party,

33:04.976 --> 33:06.367
so if you were Sarah--

33:06.458 --> 33:08.165
You'd be raging, yes.

33:08.266 --> 33:09.996
But how could you know
it'd be shown?

33:10.067 --> 33:12.130
And if you did, would you
really murder a kid

33:12.171 --> 33:13.473
you've known
his whole life?

33:15.148 --> 33:16.933
Ugh, disgusting.

33:17.063 --> 33:18.369
Who would do this?

33:24.897 --> 33:26.464
[doorbell ringing]

33:32.174 --> 33:33.451
Harper's gone out.

33:34.022 --> 33:36.735
I take it she's seen the video
that's been posted online.

33:37.126 --> 33:38.694
Have you caught
the bastard who did it?

33:39.304 --> 33:40.304
Not yet.

33:40.535 --> 33:41.554
But we will.

33:42.384 --> 33:43.384
Can you think of anyone

33:43.424 --> 33:46.110
who might have wanted
to harm Daniel, on Harper's behalf?

33:48.992 --> 33:50.094
No, I can't.

33:51.664 --> 33:53.902
Though anyone with a shred of
decency would be appalled

33:53.953 --> 33:55.552
to think that
a private video

33:56.042 --> 33:57.777
was now all over
the Internet.

33:58.781 --> 33:59.929
Why do you ask?

34:00.960 --> 34:04.156
It's my job to investigate
all possibilities.

34:04.527 --> 34:05.955
Well, could you please
make it your job

34:06.005 --> 34:08.942
to stop harassing
a young, innocent girl?

34:09.072 --> 34:10.596
[door slams and locks]

34:13.643 --> 34:15.340
[birds chirping]

34:17.036 --> 34:18.376
Thanks for coming, Abi.

34:22.652 --> 34:24.001
How you doing?

34:24.130 --> 34:25.306
I've been better.

34:25.437 --> 34:26.531
Izzy.

34:26.981 --> 34:28.166
What do you
have to say?

34:28.936 --> 34:30.688
Sorry for your loss,
Abigail.

34:31.047 --> 34:32.215
Thanks, Izzy.

34:32.425 --> 34:33.681
I know you loved him too.

34:34.351 --> 34:35.447
Come on.

34:38.495 --> 34:41.380
BRIDGET:
So, after our conversation,

34:41.411 --> 34:43.500
Julia and I
have been talking.

34:43.630 --> 34:46.284
-About what you asked us.
-About being there for you.

34:46.416 --> 34:48.001
And you understand,
don't you,

34:48.051 --> 34:50.071
that whatever I have to do,
it's only because--

34:50.202 --> 34:53.451
We know, Abi,
what you asked Sarah to do.

34:54.641 --> 34:56.382
And we know that
she refused.

34:58.353 --> 34:59.472
So, will you help me?

34:59.513 --> 35:01.819
Will you go and tell her
she owes me this?

35:02.429 --> 35:03.622
JULIA:
Does she, though?

35:04.093 --> 35:05.118
Really?

35:05.369 --> 35:07.001
If anyone owes anything--

35:07.042 --> 35:08.232
Isn't it you?

35:09.283 --> 35:10.713
Think about it, Abi.

35:11.074 --> 35:12.490
What she did.

35:12.721 --> 35:14.182
What she gave you.

35:16.153 --> 35:17.535
[thud]

35:18.155 --> 35:19.465
[screaming]Oh, God!

35:19.845 --> 35:22.190
[panicked clamoring]

35:27.282 --> 35:28.923
Michael, what are you doing?

35:28.944 --> 35:30.187
There's nothing I can do.

35:30.737 --> 35:32.376
[hysterical crying]
Sarah, please...

35:33.339 --> 35:35.509
Sarah, please...
[indistinct]

35:45.084 --> 35:48.000
[Sarah muttering incantations]

35:51.090 --> 35:53.005
[chanting incantation]

35:57.944 --> 35:59.293
[gasping]

36:01.666 --> 36:02.841
MICHAEL:
He's breathing.

36:02.971 --> 36:04.319
He's breathing.

36:11.118 --> 36:13.960
[wailing siren approaching]

36:13.980 --> 36:16.626
Okay, we need to get him inside,
clean him up.

36:16.707 --> 36:19.281
Dan, you probably don't remember
what happened,

36:19.621 --> 36:20.998
but when the police come,

36:21.028 --> 36:23.451
this is what
you tell them, okay?

36:30.347 --> 36:31.781
Six years.

36:33.251 --> 36:34.404
Yes.

36:35.395 --> 36:37.732
Six more years
of seeing him grow up, of...

36:39.182 --> 36:40.540
of him and me together.

36:41.141 --> 36:43.813
All that time
you wouldn't have had.

36:46.128 --> 36:47.403
That's what she gave me.

36:50.423 --> 36:52.037
How could I forget?

36:54.514 --> 36:56.107
I'm a monster.

36:56.137 --> 36:59.094
No, Abi,
you're a mum,

36:59.145 --> 37:01.576
who suffered
an unspeakable loss.

37:03.206 --> 37:05.961
But I actually believed what
Jake said about Harper.

37:08.056 --> 37:09.724
I tried to blackmail Sarah.

37:11.778 --> 37:13.781
Oh, God,
she must hate me!

37:14.962 --> 37:16.262
She doesn't hate you.

37:16.743 --> 37:18.135
She loves you.

37:18.526 --> 37:20.007
And it's not too late.

37:20.357 --> 37:23.054
There's still time
to make things right.

37:23.895 --> 37:25.142
Yes.

37:27.903 --> 37:29.295
Yes, I can do that.

37:32.102 --> 37:33.303
I owe her.

37:37.285 --> 37:40.072
Bridge,
did you speak to Abi?

37:40.143 --> 37:43.944
We did... and I think
it's gonna be okay.

37:44.334 --> 37:46.143
She's here
and she wants to talk.

37:46.163 --> 37:47.425
Oh, thank you.

37:47.796 --> 37:49.645
-I'm coming over.
-Okay.

37:58.164 --> 37:59.394
DCI Knight.

37:59.845 --> 38:01.344
DSI Remington.

38:01.475 --> 38:02.671
You wanted to see me?

38:03.831 --> 38:05.151
It's been too long.

38:10.508 --> 38:12.283
-Looking good, Maggie.
-[ice clinking]

38:13.053 --> 38:14.281
Bollocks, Remy.

38:14.431 --> 38:15.992
This case is
giving me ulcers.

38:16.042 --> 38:18.283
Not the proverbial
open and shut?

38:18.554 --> 38:19.796
That's why you're here?

38:20.077 --> 38:21.592
Think I can't hack it?

38:22.283 --> 38:23.968
You have nothing
to prove to me.

38:24.058 --> 38:26.465
Bullshit.
You're my boss.

38:26.836 --> 38:29.307
Though, frankly,
I should've been your boss,

38:29.717 --> 38:32.733
but hey,
job's for the boys.

38:33.113 --> 38:34.386
Do you see me arguing?

38:34.847 --> 38:36.374
You could've
turned it down.

38:38.035 --> 38:39.119
Would you?

38:43.994 --> 38:45.196
So, I've been wondering,

38:46.566 --> 38:48.003
did I make a mistake?

38:48.563 --> 38:49.745
Putting me on the case?

38:50.745 --> 38:53.145
Calling time, on us.

38:58.427 --> 39:01.620
I'm supposed to be,
what, flattered?

39:03.345 --> 39:04.388
Grateful?

39:04.949 --> 39:06.347
Glad, maybe?

39:08.725 --> 39:10.902
Knowing that I tried
to move on and couldn't.

39:26.622 --> 39:27.787
Oh, fuck it.

39:32.337 --> 39:33.622
SARAH:
Thank you, Cheryl.

39:38.564 --> 39:41.994
Well, look at us coven chicks,
all back together.

39:46.716 --> 39:49.595
I...
I don't know what to say.

39:51.719 --> 39:54.077
I was deranged.

39:57.109 --> 39:58.709
The things I said were--

40:00.219 --> 40:01.571
What I asked you to do.

40:02.141 --> 40:04.202
I never meant to hurt
you or Harper.

40:05.663 --> 40:07.960
Maybe I was in
so much pain I was just--

40:08.301 --> 40:10.075
I just wanted
to hurt everyone.

40:14.026 --> 40:15.150
I'm so sorry.

40:16.740 --> 40:18.157
Can you ever forgive me?

40:23.110 --> 40:24.933
Of course I forgive you.

40:26.762 --> 40:28.085
Of course.

40:29.465 --> 40:31.166
Harper had nothing to do
with Dan's death,

40:31.196 --> 40:32.802
-you know that, right?
-Yeah?

40:32.872 --> 40:34.253
-MM-hmm.
-Yeah?

40:34.464 --> 40:35.812
I need to hear
you say it.

40:37.213 --> 40:39.658
Harper had nothing to do
with Dan's death.

40:40.648 --> 40:43.388
And I need you to say it
to the police,

40:43.788 --> 40:46.047
and the press,
and to Ted and Jake,

40:46.067 --> 40:47.435
and all Dan's friends.

40:47.566 --> 40:49.407
Because my office
has been attacked,

40:50.017 --> 40:51.632
we've got a news crew
on our doorstop,

40:51.653 --> 40:54.039
and Harper isn't safe until
you tell everyone you know

40:54.080 --> 40:55.269
she didn't do this.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.617
I'll tell them.

40:57.648 --> 40:58.930
I promise.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.495
Oh, please.

41:07.018 --> 41:09.370
[all laughing]

41:12.964 --> 41:14.600
CHERYL:
You need to come inside, now!

41:14.631 --> 41:15.780
What--?

41:19.075 --> 41:20.951
REPORTER [on TV]: And this week,
in an extraordinary step,

41:20.982 --> 41:22.728
the Sanctuary Reporter
published an article

41:22.768 --> 41:24.121
linking a high school student

41:24.142 --> 41:25.884
to the murder of her
ex-boyfriend.

41:25.905 --> 41:27.754
That young woman
is Harper Fenn,

41:27.794 --> 41:29.042
and she's here with me now.

41:29.173 --> 41:31.375
Harper, thank you for agreeing
to speak with me.

41:31.405 --> 41:32.568
How are you feeling?

41:32.699 --> 41:34.649
What do you make of
these allegations?

41:35.450 --> 41:37.063
They're not true.

41:38.053 --> 41:39.887
Your mother's office
was defaced,

41:39.948 --> 41:41.653
and we're hearing of
other instances

41:41.704 --> 41:43.450
of Wiccaphobia
across the county.

41:43.541 --> 41:45.661
Do you and your mother
fear for your safety?

41:46.452 --> 41:49.754
Whoever did it probably
hoped that it would scare us,

41:49.795 --> 41:52.931
but really, they're the ones
that should be scared.

41:52.952 --> 41:54.329
Of witchcraft?

41:54.810 --> 41:57.244
Of the truth.
About?

42:00.084 --> 42:01.311
Dan Whithall.

42:01.362 --> 42:02.599
He was...

42:06.156 --> 42:07.404
He was a rapist.

42:12.173 --> 42:16.173
He... he drugged me
and raped me and filmed it,

42:16.213 --> 42:18.039
and that's the truth
about Dan Whithall.

42:18.080 --> 42:19.099
Harper, I have to
stop you right there.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.273
He was a rapist
and a predator and...

42:20.304 --> 42:21.488
Can I just emphasize,

42:21.518 --> 42:23.906
no charges have been brought
against Dan Whithall,

42:23.936 --> 42:26.223
or against Harper Fenn.
There won't be-- I'm innocent.

42:26.224 --> 42:28.270
That's all we have time
for this evening.

42:28.291 --> 42:29.912
We'll bring you
more updates on--

42:32.137 --> 42:33.569
You knew about this?

42:33.630 --> 42:36.347
And you dared to ask me to tell
everyone she's innocent?

42:36.397 --> 42:38.331
-Abigail, I--
-[screams, glass shatters]

42:38.461 --> 42:40.289
Isn't it enough
that she killed him?

42:40.590 --> 42:43.838
Now she's trashing his name
with her disgusting lies!

42:44.859 --> 42:45.929
Sarah, wait!

42:45.989 --> 42:47.904
"Sarah, wait--" Nice to know
who your friends really are!

42:47.915 --> 42:49.066
Abi, please don't
jump to conclusions.

42:49.097 --> 42:50.998
That devious, evil--

42:51.139 --> 42:53.694
She nearly had me agreeing
to shut down the whole thing!

42:53.825 --> 42:55.522
Well, guess what, witch!

42:55.852 --> 42:57.495
It's only just begun!

43:00.104 --> 43:01.659
[whispering]
It's okay, sweetheart.

43:04.153 --> 43:05.880
[waves rolling]

43:39.672 --> 43:41.865
We all owe Sarah something.

43:41.906 --> 43:43.077
Not anymore.

43:43.137 --> 43:45.459
Woman: The whole town's
lost its mind.

43:46.143 --> 43:48.532
Man: Abigail is on a mission
to crucify Sarah Fenn.

43:48.583 --> 43:51.120
You have to arrest that woman.
You have to make her pay.

43:51.144 --> 43:54.018
Sarah Fenn is the only witch
in Sanctuary...

43:54.053 --> 43:55.347
I didn't cast any spells.

43:55.768 --> 43:57.571
All they have to do
is a bit of digging

43:57.611 --> 43:58.686
and they'll know you lied.

43:58.716 --> 43:59.806
They're gonna be
coming for us.

43:59.846 --> 44:02.198
Woman #2:
I want us to reclaim Sanctuary.

44:02.329 --> 44:03.591
Dunk her!

44:03.722 --> 44:05.181
Get off me!

44:09.429 --> 44:14.553
â™ªâ™ª

44:16.544 --> 44:20.961
