00:43.643 --> 00:45.711
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.549
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah, keep doing that.
Okay. Okay.

00:50.551 --> 00:54.019
Oh, Larry!
- Oh... Uh, I'm sorry, help me out here.

00:54.021 --> 00:56.221
- Suzanne.
- Oh, Susan!

00:56.223 --> 00:58.991
No! Suzanne.
- I'm sorry. I meant to say Susan.

00:58.993 --> 01:01.026
No. Suzanne.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.795
Oh, Suzanne!

01:04.932 --> 01:07.266
- Oh.

01:07.268 --> 01:10.269
- Yeah.
- You are amazing.

01:10.271 --> 01:11.837
- Well...

01:11.839 --> 01:14.173
I could never have reached those
heights of passion without you.

01:14.175 --> 01:17.409
Actually, you did reach those
heights of passion without me.

01:18.611 --> 01:21.113
Oh, God, you are so damn hot.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.682
Yeah. Right there, Larry.
That's it.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.717
- Don't stop.
- Larry!

01:26.419 --> 01:27.753
What?

01:29.722 --> 01:31.757
What?

01:31.759 --> 01:36.028
- So, how about some breakfast?
- I couldn't possibly.

01:39.399 --> 01:42.634
- You see, Su...
- Zanne!

01:42.636 --> 01:43.969
You see, Zanne,

01:43.971 --> 01:46.572
I know you'd want me to have breakfast,

01:46.574 --> 01:49.475
date for a while, get married, start a family,

01:49.477 --> 01:51.443
plants roots in the community,

01:51.445 --> 01:54.179
join the local church, synagogue or a polygamous cult,

01:54.181 --> 01:56.181
but that's not my speed.

01:56.183 --> 02:00.552
If I stay on the ground too
long, the sky starts to beckon.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.754
Don't you ever get tired of that lifestyle,

02:02.756 --> 02:04.557
flying from place to place all the time?

02:04.558 --> 02:07.593
Every once in a while, I wake up in a cold sweat,

02:07.595 --> 02:10.829
my entire being enveloped by
a crushing, empty loneliness

02:10.830 --> 02:13.799
that physically presses down on
me till I can barely breathe.

02:15.101 --> 02:17.469
But then I ignore it and it usually passes.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.638
That doesn't sound too healthy.

02:19.640 --> 02:23.809
Well, mind-blowing sex and free medical advice.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.879
- Zanne, what don't you give?
- I have a surprise for you.

02:31.851 --> 02:34.253
Is that what I think it is?

02:34.255 --> 02:36.355
Here's something to remember me by.

02:36.956 --> 02:38.524
- Oh.

02:38.526 --> 02:42.027
You sure I can't get you anything?
A little breakfast to go?

02:42.029 --> 02:44.763
Okay, but just something quick and easy.

04:36.075 --> 04:38.543
So...

04:38.545 --> 04:40.779
Mr. Gaye,

04:40.781 --> 04:43.448
um, you're a flight attendant?

04:43.450 --> 04:44.883
- Bingo.

04:44.885 --> 04:47.786
- And, uh, you want us to publish your book?
- Yahtzee.

04:51.090 --> 04:53.610
- Oh, but the book is not written yet?
- Twister.

04:55.428 --> 04:59.398
Uh, and it is the story of your life?

04:59.400 --> 05:04.436
<i>The Unauthorized Autobiography.</i>

05:04.438 --> 05:06.571
<i>The Unauthorized Autobiography?</i>

05:06.573 --> 05:08.440
Um,

05:08.442 --> 05:12.277
- but an autobiography cannot be unauthorized.
- Or can it?

05:12.279 --> 05:16.381
By writing the book, you're implicitly
authorizing that it be written.

05:16.383 --> 05:18.016
Define "implicitly."

05:18.018 --> 05:21.453
Mr. Gaye, was there ever a time in
the past that maybe I'm unaware of

05:21.455 --> 05:24.923
where I wiped my bottom with 20 minutes of your life?

05:24.925 --> 05:28.126
Define "aware" and "20."

05:28.128 --> 05:30.062
- Who arranged this meeting?
- Uh...

05:30.064 --> 05:31.496
I... I did, sir.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.465
You're fired.

05:36.636 --> 05:39.304
Oh. And happy birthday.

05:39.306 --> 05:42.374
- Hey.
- Would someone please show this jackass the door?

05:42.376 --> 05:44.076
I already saw the door on my way in.

05:44.078 --> 05:47.412
Now, sir, my life story yearns to be told.

05:47.414 --> 05:49.348
It's a tale of intrigue, adventure

05:49.350 --> 05:51.316
and life among the clouds.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.719
Mr. Gaye,

05:53.721 --> 05:56.588
if you held a gun to my head and said to me,

05:56.590 --> 05:59.458
"Hey, be less interested in my book"

05:59.460 --> 06:03.562
"or I will splatter the walls
with the contents of your skull,"

06:04.764 --> 06:06.331
I don't think I could.

06:07.467 --> 06:09.935
I guess I'll just have to take my story elsewhere.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.743
There are other fish in the publishing sea, my friend.

06:19.445 --> 06:22.013
Yes, in Manhattan, I'm gonna need two numbers,

06:22.015 --> 06:25.250
the first one is for Simon, and
then I need one for Schuster.

06:27.888 --> 06:31.623
Look, if I walk out that door,
guys, I'm not coming back!

06:31.625 --> 06:32.791
You got it?

06:34.127 --> 06:35.594
Oh, you think I'm bluffing?

06:36.262 --> 06:37.763
You think I'm bluffing?

06:37.765 --> 06:39.931
Good day, everyone!

06:50.543 --> 06:51.610
Okay.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.746
I'm headed to the elevator.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.783
- Do we have any kind of screening process here?

06:57.785 --> 07:00.051
Okay. I'm in the elevator.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.387
- Get out.
- Yep. Yes.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.357
It's closing.
The door is closing.

07:05.359 --> 07:08.393
- The door is closing.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.096
Last chance!

07:11.098 --> 07:14.266
If I get in a taxi, you're out of luck!

07:24.677 --> 07:26.695
Is there a quicker way to the airport, my friend?

07:26.721 --> 07:27.946
I'm running late for a flight.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.981
Sorry, man, it's like this all over.

07:29.983 --> 07:34.519
- Rush hour traffic, you know.
- I know that accent.

07:34.521 --> 07:36.588
What part of Canada are you from?

07:38.357 --> 07:40.158
I'm from Jamaica.

07:40.160 --> 07:44.129
Yeah, but you obviously lived
in Canada for a long time.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.064
No, man, never been there.

07:46.066 --> 07:49.768
But your parents were Canadian
and spoke it around the house.

07:49.770 --> 07:50.936
No, man!

07:53.439 --> 07:57.876
Bet you never had to worry aboot
traffic like this in Saskatchewan,

07:57.878 --> 07:59.444
eh?

08:00.646 --> 08:01.713
Eh?

08:36.082 --> 08:37.182
Who's that guy?

08:58.170 --> 09:00.405
I can help you with that bag.
All right.

09:02.241 --> 09:05.544
Please be careful! I have my grandfather's
remains in an urn up there.

09:05.546 --> 09:08.113
- I will, sir.
- Excuse me!

09:08.115 --> 09:11.116
This woman claims she's in 9E, but that's my seat.

09:11.118 --> 09:14.119
I'll try to straighten that out.
Okay?

09:14.121 --> 09:16.988
I can't remember if I ordered a
kosher meal or not. Can you help me?

09:16.990 --> 09:19.870
Okay. If you can just give me one
second, I will check that, I promise.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.466
Okay, people, please, please, please, okay?
It's my very first flight

09:28.468 --> 09:31.603
and our lead attendant is not here,
but I'm doing the best that I can.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.705
So, please, bear with me.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.145
Grandpa!

09:49.755 --> 09:51.256
Excuse me.

09:51.891 --> 09:53.358
Is there a problem here?

09:53.960 --> 09:55.293
Allow me.

10:11.477 --> 10:13.044
Anything else?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.179
She's in my seat.

10:16.816 --> 10:17.983
Oh.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.619
Actually, ma'am, you're not in 9E.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.321
You're in 3b.

10:23.990 --> 10:25.423
Common mistake.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.995
I've been trying to find out
if I ordered a kosher meal.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.330
Rabbi, I got the passenger manifest in advance,

10:32.332 --> 10:36.668
so I personally prepared you a nice piece
of chicken with a side of borscht.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.036
Thank you, my son.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.208
What about my grandpa? Look.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.920
- Gramps comin' at ya!

10:58.458 --> 10:59.891
Thanks.
You really saved me there.

10:59.893 --> 11:02.494
You saying "Thanks" is thanks enough.

11:02.862 --> 11:04.462
Um, okay.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.465
- I guess we're ready.
- Not yet.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.334
My finely honed senses tells me there's someone

11:09.336 --> 11:11.670
on board this flight who's a threat to us all.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.589
You, sir.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.592
Frat guy, huh?

11:34.594 --> 11:37.696
- Oh, Phi Beta Kappa, it's an academic fraternity.
- Oh?

11:37.698 --> 11:40.365
You like to drink, get out of control,

11:40.367 --> 11:42.967
you boot and rally, you cause a scene.

11:42.969 --> 11:45.370
No, I don't drink.
I'm a Rhodes Scholar.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.672
I'm actually flying to UCLA to collect an award.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.774
I won't have those kind of shenanigans on my flight!

11:49.776 --> 11:51.276
Take a hike, party boy!

11:51.278 --> 11:53.545
- No, but I'm...
- Save it, <i> Animal House!</i>

11:53.946 --> 11:55.213
Off my plane!

11:57.149 --> 11:58.483
Off my plane!

12:09.929 --> 12:12.197
Okay, rookie, let's fly this bitch.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.649
Miss McCoy, it's all yours.

12:32.818 --> 12:34.119
Thank you.

12:34.121 --> 12:38.156
Gentlemen and ladies, what do
we spend the most money on?

12:40.426 --> 12:42.961
- Passenger safety.

12:45.799 --> 12:48.767
Stop it, Geddes, stop it!
This is serious.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.836
Outside of equipment, fuel and brass tacks,

12:51.838 --> 12:55.140
our greatest operating expense is service.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.176
Flight attendants.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.345
- Yes.
- Their union is strong,

13:00.347 --> 13:03.715
their salaries keep rising.
Not to mention their benefits.

13:03.717 --> 13:04.883
But what if I told you there was a way

13:04.885 --> 13:08.319
to completely eliminate human flight attendants?

13:08.321 --> 13:11.082
Even if we could, where would you hide the bodies?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.958
Oh, just asking.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.095
Gentlemen, there is someone
I would like for you to meet.

13:23.102 --> 13:24.636
Good morning, Miss McCoy.

13:25.771 --> 13:27.472
Good morning, Sally.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.774
Sally, may I have a cup of coffee, please?

13:29.776 --> 13:30.842
My pleasure.

13:36.048 --> 13:37.849
Thank you, Sally.

13:39.753 --> 13:42.387
Oh, this coffee is way too hot!

13:42.389 --> 13:44.689
Oh.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.563
I'm sorry, Miss McCoy. I'll find
some more coffee that's not so hot.

13:51.565 --> 13:53.965
- What the...
- She's not real!

13:53.967 --> 13:56.367
- Right, Sally?
- That's right, Miss McCoy.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.369
My body is state-of-the-art neoprene

13:58.371 --> 14:00.772
stretched over a complex electronic framework,

14:00.774 --> 14:02.373
my brain is a powerful microprocessor

14:02.375 --> 14:04.375
capable of five billion decisions per second

14:04.377 --> 14:06.678
and my boobs are a perky 34C.

14:07.079 --> 14:08.379
This is amazing.

14:08.381 --> 14:11.015
Go ahead, touch her.
You'd never know the difference.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.684
- What?
- Touch her.

14:15.387 --> 14:18.223
You mean, just... Wow!

14:31.470 --> 14:33.338
I'm Nathan, by the way.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.772
The pleasure's yours, Nathan.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.409
That was incredible, all the stuff you did back there.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.845
I'm not sure "incredible" is the right word.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.347
I believe it's "uncredible."

14:43.616 --> 14:45.450
I'm pretty sure it's "incredible."

14:45.452 --> 14:47.485
Let's agree not to disagree.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.421
I don't think that's the expression.

14:50.423 --> 14:53.157
Are you disagreeing with me?
We just agreed not to.

14:55.327 --> 14:57.729
You were saying?

14:57.731 --> 14:59.931
They sure didn't teach us any of
that stuff at the training academy.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.733
Yeah, that's why I never listen to what they teach.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.335
I make my own rules, then I break 'em.

15:04.337 --> 15:07.272
But if they're your own rules,
why do you have to break 'em?

15:07.274 --> 15:08.940
- Well, I...
- Wouldn't it be easier

15:08.942 --> 15:10.775
to make up different rules
that you didn't have to break?

15:10.777 --> 15:13.278
- Not necessarily.
- Or to not make up any rules at all.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.647
The point is, I'm a renegade.

15:15.649 --> 15:18.383
Wait a minute.
You're Larry Gaye!

15:18.385 --> 15:20.051
My first day and I get to fly

15:20.053 --> 15:21.853
- with Larry Gaye?
- So cool.

15:21.855 --> 15:24.722
My God, the stories, the women.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.825
- Six Golden Coffee Pots!

15:28.427 --> 15:29.928
You're a legend.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.729
Relax. Look.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.899
I know this may come as a shock,
but I'm just a human being.

15:34.901 --> 15:37.702
I mean, if you cut me, I bleed.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.004
If you pinch me, I cry.

15:41.573 --> 15:45.443
If you pull my hair, I scream like a little girl.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.779
If you back an SUV over my bare feet,

15:47.781 --> 15:50.548
I'd likely go into shock.
The pain is so intense.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.785
If you eliminate vitamins B and D from my diet,

15:53.787 --> 15:56.888
my skin turns a shade of taupe you've never seen.

16:02.728 --> 16:04.696
I can't breathe.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.965
Hello.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.967
Carry on, please.

16:09.835 --> 16:12.503
You're looking at the new Flightpal 200

16:12.505 --> 16:14.739
made by Techtronics Industries.

16:14.741 --> 16:18.609
Now, for a fraction of the cost of a flight attendant,

16:18.611 --> 16:20.878
we can have every one of our planes

16:20.880 --> 16:23.648
fully manned by Flightpals

16:23.650 --> 16:26.150
within one year.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.119
Excuse me, Miss McCoy.

16:28.121 --> 16:31.022
The reputation of this airline is built on service.

16:31.024 --> 16:34.292
How do you know that the Flightpal 200

16:34.294 --> 16:36.427
is better than our flight attendants?

16:36.429 --> 16:37.962
That's a great question.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.430
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:39.432 --> 16:42.734
the President and Founder of Techtronics Industries,

16:43.135 --> 16:44.969
Bob Techtronics.

16:44.971 --> 16:48.639
Folks, I wouldn't expect you to
just sign on the dotted line.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.009
I only ask for the opportunity to prove to you

16:51.011 --> 16:54.679
that the Flightpal can
outperform an error-prone human.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.081
And how do you plan on doing that?

16:57.083 --> 17:00.051
By letting Sally here go up against your best

17:00.053 --> 17:02.887
in a challenge of flight attendant skills.

17:02.889 --> 17:05.089
- That sounds fair, doesn't it?
- Absolutely. Let's set it up.

17:05.090 --> 17:08.960
If it works, it could be a financial
lifesaver for the entire company.

17:08.962 --> 17:11.262
Thank you so much, Mr. T.

17:11.263 --> 17:12.597
Sally, we'll talk.

17:13.464 --> 17:15.032
If you remove

17:15.035 --> 17:17.535
the vestibular system from my inner
ear, I have difficulty balancing.

17:17.537 --> 17:21.638
If you take a croquet mallet,
coat it with shards of glass

17:21.641 --> 17:24.375
- and swing it directly at my testes...
- Okay, you're human!

17:24.377 --> 17:26.676
- You made your point.
- I think I've made my point.

17:32.618 --> 17:35.086
Well, look who it is.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.356
Bryce. Felder.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.992
That's "Captain" to you.

17:40.994 --> 17:44.395
Sorry, Crapton Bryce.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.164
How you feeling today, Gaye?

17:47.232 --> 17:50.101
Are you getting sleepier?

17:50.803 --> 17:53.171
Oh, snap!

18:04.584 --> 18:08.953
It's ancient history, Nathan,
like the Romanian Empire.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.650
- But...
- I said,

18:12.091 --> 18:13.291
ancient history.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.928
- Okay. Got it.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.330
<i>Uh...</i>

18:19.332 --> 18:22.300
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Bryce here.</i>

18:22.302 --> 18:24.569
<i>Just wanted to speak as your pilot</i>

18:24.571 --> 18:26.270
<i>and not a lowly flight attendant,</i>

18:26.272 --> 18:29.040
<i>and say it's great to be piloting this plane</i>

18:29.708 --> 18:31.576
<i>because I'm a pilot</i>

18:31.578 --> 18:33.811
<i>who passed through the pilot training academy</i>

18:33.813 --> 18:36.547
<i>and became a pilot.</i>

19:14.820 --> 19:16.554
These big union meetings tend to drag

19:16.556 --> 19:18.756
like a turtle's nut sack, am I right?

19:18.758 --> 19:21.559
Excuse me?
Show some respect.

19:22.461 --> 19:24.128
What's that?

19:24.130 --> 19:27.999
Actually, I find them interesting and informative.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.234
Uh, surely you can't be serious.

19:30.236 --> 19:31.936
I am serious.

19:31.938 --> 19:34.272
- Then should I stop calling you Shirley?

19:44.717 --> 19:46.450
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

19:46.452 --> 19:48.386
<i>and members of the Fraternal Association</i>

19:48.388 --> 19:51.322
<i>of Federated Airlines Flight Attendants, welcome.</i>

19:51.324 --> 19:54.358
<i>Management has asked us to select</i>

19:54.360 --> 19:56.961
<i>our top flight attendant</i>

19:56.963 --> 20:00.031
<i>to go up against the Flightpal</i>

20:00.033 --> 20:02.066
<i>in a performance test.</i>

20:02.068 --> 20:06.671
<i>And the Research Committee has given me one name.</i>

20:06.673 --> 20:08.973
<i>Which one of you is Gaye?</i>

20:15.847 --> 20:17.281
<i>Larry Gaye.</i>

20:18.850 --> 20:21.452
- That'd be me.
- <i>Ah!</i>

20:21.454 --> 20:24.355
<i>Mr. Gaye, just how good are you?</i>

20:24.357 --> 20:26.724
On a scale from one to 10,

20:26.726 --> 20:28.859
it can't be quantified.

20:28.861 --> 20:31.062
<i>Perhaps you would try to quantify.</i>

20:31.064 --> 20:33.264
Well...

20:33.266 --> 20:35.433
I have won an unprecedented six,

20:35.435 --> 20:38.336
count them, six, consecutive Golden Coffee Pots.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.570
Roll the clip!

20:40.672 --> 20:43.407
<i>Uh, guys, I...</i>

20:43.409 --> 20:46.110
<i>I don't know what to say, except maybe,</i>

20:46.112 --> 20:48.713
<i>suck it, other flight attendants!</i>

20:48.715 --> 20:50.147
<i>Suck it dry!</i>

20:50.149 --> 20:52.550
Hey, hey, hey! You cut it off
before my dance. Not cool.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.919
<i>Mr. Gaye, I want to ask you,</i>

20:54.921 --> 20:59.390
<i>will you help spare the jobs of everyone in this room</i>

20:59.392 --> 21:02.026
<i>and thousands of others nationwide?</i>

21:07.432 --> 21:09.500
Seems like a hassle. Pass!

21:09.502 --> 21:10.835
I'm gonna pass!

21:12.638 --> 21:14.505
- <i>No. Mr. Gaye!</i>
- Larry.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.474
What? What? What?

21:16.476 --> 21:19.710
<i>We need you.
Our livelihood depends on it.</i>

21:26.485 --> 21:27.685
Fine, I'll do it.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.253
- I'll do it!

21:29.255 --> 21:31.689
Ladies and gentlemen of the FAFAFA, worry not!

21:31.691 --> 21:34.825
I will take on this scourge and I will win.

21:34.827 --> 21:37.528
Nothing on God's green Earth will stop me!

21:37.530 --> 21:39.697
<i>Thank you, Mr. Gaye.
Thank you.</i>

21:39.699 --> 21:41.766
As long as it's not on a Tuesday morning.
I have a Zumba class.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.267
<i>Okay.</i>

21:43.269 --> 21:46.070
Or Saturdays at 3:00. I have a
standing body wax. Gotta do that.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.973
Wednesdays aren't great.
Hump day.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.808
And I take that quite literally.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.310
- You know what I'm talking about.
- <i>Thank you, Mr. Gaye.</i>

21:52.312 --> 21:53.611
<i>Larry Gaye, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

21:53.613 --> 21:55.846
- <i>Larry Gaye, thank you.</i>
- You got it.

21:57.183 --> 22:00.751
Larry!

22:07.693 --> 22:10.895
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
aboard Federated Airlines Flight 75</i>

22:10.897 --> 22:12.997
<i>with non-stop service to Los Angeles.</i>

22:12.999 --> 22:15.099
<i>We'll be taxiing in just a few moments.</i>

22:15.101 --> 22:16.767
<i>But first, allow me to demonstrate</i>

22:16.769 --> 22:19.870
<i>the safety features of our Boeing 737.</i>

22:19.872 --> 22:21.872
Nathan. Thank you.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.674
<i>You fasten the seatbelt</i>

22:23.676 --> 22:25.676
<i>by inserting the metal end</i>

22:28.013 --> 22:33.184
<i>into the expectant buckle.</i>

22:33.186 --> 22:36.120
<i>A little at first, you know, just enough to</i>

22:37.155 --> 22:38.656
<i>tease the buckle.</i>

22:40.092 --> 22:41.459
<i>You want some of that?</i>

22:42.761 --> 22:44.161
<i>Hmm, yeah.</i>

22:46.231 --> 22:47.932
<i>Ohh!</i>

22:47.934 --> 22:51.369
<i>Take that buckle.
Take it! Yeah.</i>

22:51.371 --> 22:53.237
- <i>Mmm, yeah.</i>
-

22:53.239 --> 22:54.739
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

22:54.741 --> 22:56.307
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

22:56.309 --> 22:58.843
<i>And finally, when that buckle
just can't take any more,</i>

22:58.845 --> 23:01.312
<i>you pull on this thing to release it.</i>

23:03.950 --> 23:07.051
<i>We don't anticipate it, but should
there be a change in cabin pressure,</i>

23:07.053 --> 23:09.553
<i>your oxygen mask will drop down.</i>

23:09.555 --> 23:12.990
<i>You place the mask over your mouth, like so.</i>

23:21.433 --> 23:23.267
<i>Mmm, yeah.</i>

23:24.703 --> 23:26.570
<i>Okay.</i>

23:26.572 --> 23:29.240
<i>For those of you seated in an emergency exit row,</i>

23:29.242 --> 23:32.710
<i>like, uh, I don't know, say you.</i>

23:33.912 --> 23:36.914
<i>If called upon to open the emergency door, well,</i>

23:38.250 --> 23:40.290
<i>you're gonna pull on that big lever.</i>

23:41.520 --> 23:44.488
<i>Yeah, yeah, you're gonna pull on it real nice</i>

23:45.291 --> 23:48.759
<i>Ooh, I bet you know how to pull that thing just right.</i>

23:48.761 --> 23:49.894
<i>Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.</i>

23:49.896 --> 23:51.195
<i>You know what I'm talking about,</i>

23:51.197 --> 23:52.797
<i>-you naughty little tart.</i>

23:52.799 --> 23:54.498
<i>Flight attendants, please be seated for take-off.</i>

23:54.500 --> 23:57.501
<i>Okay. Power down all electronic devices.</i>

23:57.503 --> 23:59.303
<i>We'll be up in the air shortly.</i>

23:59.305 --> 24:00.838
<i>Thank you, everybody.</i>

24:04.075 --> 24:07.378
We have got a live one in 10b.

24:07.380 --> 24:09.621
I think those instructions could have been clearer.

24:17.924 --> 24:20.825
<i>Uh, folks, we're about to start our in-flight movie,</i>

24:20.827 --> 24:23.661
License to Chill.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.596
<i>Audio can be found on Channel 10.</i>

24:29.202 --> 24:32.102
- Hey, Nate, can you grab the disk out of my bag?
- Yeah.

24:32.104 --> 24:34.738
Gaye, I asked for a Fresca five minutes ago.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.974
What happened?
Did you trip over your skirt?

24:36.976 --> 24:39.977
So sorry, I was, uh...
I was about to bring it in.

24:41.646 --> 24:45.483
Well, maybe if you spent less time flirting
with your little gal pal over there,

24:45.485 --> 24:48.486
you'd be able to focus on your job.

24:48.488 --> 24:51.722
I already do focus on my job as six, count them, six,

24:51.724 --> 24:54.758
Golden Coffee Pots can attest.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.594
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

24:58.096 --> 25:01.432
How does it feel working with the
biggest wussy in the business?

25:01.434 --> 25:03.434
- Well...
- Don't talk!

25:03.436 --> 25:05.002
I gotta go fly this bird.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.989
Are you gonna tell me what's that all about?

25:15.015 --> 25:15.880
Sorry, Nathan.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.748
I'm an intensely private person.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.984
You made a deal to publish your
autobiography so you could,

25:19.986 --> 25:23.087
and I quote, "Share your story with the world."

25:23.089 --> 25:24.488
It's unauthorized.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.766
Fine. I guess you'll read it anyway.

25:37.102 --> 25:39.236
It all started when I was a little boy...

25:39.238 --> 25:40.938
- Uh, Larry...
- Please don't interrupt.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.606
You asked for the story.
Now let me tell it.

25:42.608 --> 25:44.742
- No, but it's...
- Hey! Here's how it works up here.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.377
When a veteran is telling a rookie a story,

25:46.379 --> 25:49.213
the rookie, you, listens,

25:49.215 --> 25:51.181
<i>sans</i> interruption. <i> Sans!</i>

25:53.485 --> 25:55.819
As I was saying,

25:55.821 --> 25:58.622
<i>I loved my father more than anything.</i>

25:58.624 --> 26:01.325
<i>So when he left me, I was devastated.</i>

26:01.327 --> 26:04.662
<i>Even if it was only for a few minutes.</i>

26:07.833 --> 26:13.304
<i>Well, you can imagine how upset
I was when he left for good.</i>

26:14.773 --> 26:16.173
Where are you going, Dad?

26:16.175 --> 26:20.544
Hey-hey, there he is.

26:20.546 --> 26:22.479
There he always is.

26:22.481 --> 26:24.615
I'm... I'm...

26:24.617 --> 26:28.385
I'm just going out to have these suitcases polished.

26:28.387 --> 26:30.147
But it's the middle of the night.

26:31.122 --> 26:32.623
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

26:32.625 --> 26:34.625
And there is a, uh,

26:34.627 --> 26:38.395
24-hour suitcase polisher over on State Street.

26:38.397 --> 26:40.264
Oh, okay.

26:42.067 --> 26:43.434
Good night.

26:43.436 --> 26:45.970
Good night, Son.
Have a good life.

26:45.972 --> 26:48.572
Until tomorrow morning,

26:48.574 --> 26:51.809
when I will see you again

26:51.811 --> 26:56.580
because I'm definitely not running out on you

26:56.582 --> 26:58.949
or your mother,

26:58.951 --> 27:02.920
or the life of debt and
dysfunction we've built together.

27:04.756 --> 27:07.825
<i>But I wasn't stupid.
It didn't take long to figure out</i>

27:07.827 --> 27:10.461
<i>that somewhere on his way to
the 24-hour suitcase polisher,</i>

27:10.463 --> 27:12.329
<i>-he decided to leave for good.</i>

27:19.004 --> 27:21.105
<i>My mom tried everything she could</i>

27:21.107 --> 27:23.774
<i>to take my mind off the hurt of Dad leaving,</i>

27:26.544 --> 27:28.245
<i>but nothing could distract me.</i>

27:28.914 --> 27:32.449
<i>In an all-new episode</i> of
Boys Whose Fathers Love Them

27:32.451 --> 27:33.951
and Have Not Run Off Unexpectedly...

27:33.953 --> 27:35.786
No!

27:35.788 --> 27:38.422
<i>I knew of no way to make the pain go away.</i>

27:41.960 --> 27:44.728
<i>Until that moment,</i>

27:44.730 --> 27:48.232
<i>when I realized that if I could be
way up in the clouds, then maybe</i>

27:48.234 --> 27:52.436
<i>it would take me away from the
hurt I felt down on the ground.</i>

27:52.438 --> 27:55.773
<i>And that's when I decided that
what I wanted more than anything</i>

27:56.174 --> 27:57.641
<i>was to fly.</i>

27:58.977 --> 28:01.779
- Larry, behind you.
- Yes, that chapter was behind me.

28:01.781 --> 28:03.213
Well observed.

28:03.215 --> 28:06.116
Then, in 1995, I went to flight school.

28:09.054 --> 28:11.855
Building 5.
Orientation's on the right.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.260
- Hi.
- Hi there.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.761
I'm Gaye.

28:18.663 --> 28:19.730
Really?

28:21.032 --> 28:22.099
Uh...

28:24.335 --> 28:26.503
I have a private bunk

28:26.505 --> 28:29.440
with the only bathtub in this whole facility.

28:29.442 --> 28:31.542
Cadet Larry Gaye.

28:31.544 --> 28:35.045
- Right. Uh, building 5. Orientation's on the right.
- Thank you.

28:39.017 --> 28:40.751
That's what I'm talking about.

28:41.886 --> 28:44.188
Here, here

28:44.190 --> 28:46.423
and especially here.

28:47.692 --> 28:51.161
Ladies and gentlemen, you need
to know these principles cold.

28:51.163 --> 28:54.331
<i>I had big dreams, and even bigger confidence.</i>

28:54.333 --> 28:58.035
<i>I was gonna be the best damn pilot in the world.</i>

28:58.037 --> 29:01.672
All right.
Define lift. Gaye.

29:03.541 --> 29:06.677
A positive force caused by the
difference in air pressure

29:06.679 --> 29:08.746
- under and above a wing, sir.
- Drag?

29:08.748 --> 29:11.882
The resistance of the air to
anything moving through it, sir!

29:11.884 --> 29:13.117
And thrust?

29:15.653 --> 29:17.187
Damn, he's good.

29:18.656 --> 29:20.324
E, P, H,

29:20.326 --> 29:22.726
- T, O, Z.
- Good.

29:22.728 --> 29:24.294
The bottom line, please?

29:27.232 --> 29:28.298
That's...

29:29.367 --> 29:32.169
J, M, V...

29:32.171 --> 29:34.772
No, no, no.
That's not correct.

29:34.774 --> 29:37.908
Uh, actually, Doc, I'm working off that chart.

29:37.910 --> 29:40.878
- Are you kidding me?
- H, R,

29:46.051 --> 29:47.551
Bastard.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.788
Reduce airspeed 50 knots.

29:55.026 --> 29:56.860
Lower angle of left wing.

29:57.929 --> 30:00.297
Come on. Challenge me, bud.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.233
<i>I wasn't cocky.
I just knew what I was doing...</i>

30:03.235 --> 30:04.735
Deploy landing gear.

30:06.271 --> 30:09.840
<i>And bragged about it, in an obnoxious way.</i>

30:09.842 --> 30:11.802
What's the matter?
You need to use your hands?

30:16.648 --> 30:20.484
That's right. I was on my way
and nothing was gonna stop me.

30:24.222 --> 30:26.190
So what happened?

30:26.192 --> 30:28.425
All that was left was the actual flying.

30:31.063 --> 30:32.763
<i>You're coming in too hot, Gaye.</i>

30:33.631 --> 30:35.666
<i>You're... You're way off course!</i>

30:36.334 --> 30:38.135
<i>Gaye, can you hear me?</i>

30:39.537 --> 30:40.838
<i>Gaye! Wake up!</i>

30:48.447 --> 30:50.147
Wake up, wake up.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.890
Yeah, there's something wrong with this kid.

30:58.356 --> 31:01.892
Gaye, I've got some bad news.

31:01.894 --> 31:05.729
And it's my job to give it to you in
the most professional way possible.

31:07.599 --> 31:09.733
Guess what it is.

31:09.735 --> 31:13.604
- Heart disease?
- No.

31:13.606 --> 31:15.839
- Measles?
- You're getting cooler.

31:16.507 --> 31:19.509
Oh, uh, okay, okay, okay, um...

31:21.379 --> 31:22.913
- Nervous disorder.
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.

31:22.915 --> 31:24.281
- That's warmer.
- Okay.

31:24.283 --> 31:26.350
- Mumps?
- No, colder.

31:26.352 --> 31:27.784
- Anemia.
- Oh, you're ice-cold.

31:27.786 --> 31:29.853
Come on! Doc, just tell me.

31:29.855 --> 31:32.222
- You have narcolepsy.
- Oh.

31:32.224 --> 31:35.125
It's a neurological disorder
caused by the brain's inability

31:35.127 --> 31:38.095
to regulate sleep-wake cycles.

31:38.097 --> 31:40.858
In other words, you fall asleep uncontrollably.

31:41.599 --> 31:43.367
- That's ridic...
- Hmm?

31:44.235 --> 31:45.903
Sorry, I thought I had to sneeze.

31:45.905 --> 31:47.738
Oh, I thought you were having a stroke.

31:47.740 --> 31:48.972
That's ridiculous.

32:07.325 --> 32:08.825
- Yes!

32:20.271 --> 32:24.441
So, my dreams of being a pilot were
smashed into a thousand pieces.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.410
The only way I was gonna fly was in this apron,

32:26.412 --> 32:29.279
and Bryce and Felder never let me forget it.

32:30.448 --> 32:32.349
But it's all in the past.

32:32.351 --> 32:35.085
Never even think about it.
I'm as happy as I seem.

32:39.490 --> 32:41.091
I'm glad you're over it.

32:44.829 --> 32:46.663
Someone's playing our song.

32:51.869 --> 32:52.936
Ah.

32:54.372 --> 32:56.139
Is there something I can help you with?

32:56.141 --> 32:59.142
I wanted to tell you how much I'm enjoying the movie.

32:59.144 --> 33:03.080
It's not <i> Ice Age 2</i> or even <i>3,</i> but it's a jaunty romp,

33:03.082 --> 33:04.282
it's pleasantly paced.

33:07.385 --> 33:08.752
Turbulence.

33:09.520 --> 33:10.654
Excuse me for a second.

33:15.994 --> 33:19.229
Oh! <i> Uh, folks, folks, folks.</i>

33:19.231 --> 33:22.866
- <i>We gave you the wrong</i>
- License to Chill.

33:22.868 --> 33:25.969
<i>That was the director's cut, with
some scenes that had been omitted,</i>

33:25.971 --> 33:29.306
<i>and I think wisely so.</i>

33:29.308 --> 33:32.709
<i>Here's some more family friendly entertainment.</i>

33:43.021 --> 33:44.254
How are you?

33:47.091 --> 33:48.792
You were saying.

33:48.794 --> 33:51.595
Perhaps someday you and I
could make a movie like that.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.563
<i>License to Chill?</i>

33:53.565 --> 33:58.735
No, I mean, I'd like you to make
love to me in every way imaginable.

34:07.612 --> 34:09.545
Ooh.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.315
Shall we ignore the fact that it smells
like Death's underpants in here?

34:12.317 --> 34:13.382
Let's.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.385
Okay, can I get you a drink?

34:15.387 --> 34:17.687
- Vodka, rocks.
- Yes, it does.

34:18.922 --> 34:20.322
Oh, right.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.370
- Thank you.

34:33.371 --> 34:34.603
That'll be $6.

34:37.175 --> 34:38.574
- Oh.
- Hmm.

34:39.677 --> 34:40.777
Oh.

34:42.679 --> 34:46.315
Ah, yes.
Um, do you happen to have exact change?

34:46.318 --> 34:47.484
No, I don't.

34:47.485 --> 34:49.286
What are we gonna do about that?

34:57.495 --> 34:58.595
Here.

35:00.565 --> 35:01.832
Where were we?

35:01.834 --> 35:03.834
I wanna know everything about you.

35:03.836 --> 35:05.669
I want to feel what it's like to touch you.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.804
I want your body to possess my body.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.272
In a sexual way?

35:15.413 --> 35:17.614
Hi, there.

35:17.616 --> 35:22.052
So, uh, we're all out of beef stew,
would you like some lasagna?

35:22.720 --> 35:25.422
Oh, but I love beef stew.

35:26.524 --> 35:28.492
Oh, this sucks.

35:29.694 --> 35:30.794
I apologize, sir.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.462
- No!
- Okay, all right.

35:33.364 --> 35:36.266
Oh, uh, glad I could help, ma'am.

35:36.268 --> 35:37.934
If anyone else needs help with the faucets,

35:37.936 --> 35:40.804
please don't hesitate to call,
they can be a tad tricky.

35:43.040 --> 35:45.075
If you could just give me one moment.

35:46.077 --> 35:47.277
Hmm.

35:48.447 --> 35:52.149
Presiding over an emergency
meeting of the Mile High Club.

35:52.151 --> 35:53.726
Well, I'm glad you had fun.
We ran out of

35:53.752 --> 35:55.452
beef stew, these people are ready to kill me.

35:55.454 --> 35:56.987
Did you tell them we ran out?

35:56.989 --> 36:02.626
Okay, rookie, lesson one. It's not beef
stew they want, they just want a choice.

36:02.628 --> 36:06.329
- But there is no...
- Watch and learn from a professional.

36:07.431 --> 36:10.400
Oh, left the luggage hatch open.

36:10.402 --> 36:16.740
Folks, for dinner we have lasagna
or a stew of beef and brown lice.

36:16.742 --> 36:18.074
Well, I'll have the lasagna.

36:18.076 --> 36:20.844
Excellent choice, my dear.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.580
Sir, would you like lasagna or beef with cancer sauce?

36:23.582 --> 36:26.483
- I better go for lasagna.
- I think you better, yeah.

36:27.451 --> 36:30.253
Sir, lasagna or sliced elderly human feet?

36:30.255 --> 36:32.122
- Lasagna.
- Lasagna. Excellent choice.

36:37.329 --> 36:41.264
Stick with me, Nath. You'll gain a mentor,
wingman and all-around fun captain,

36:41.266 --> 36:46.069
and having you around might help ward off
my occasional crushing, empty loneliness.

36:46.071 --> 36:47.704
The crushing, empty loneliness you ignore?

36:47.706 --> 36:49.773
What crushing, empty loneliness?

36:55.580 --> 36:56.646
Yeah!

37:11.562 --> 37:12.996
Call me.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.664
I will.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.348
Yeah, yeah.

39:29.700 --> 39:30.800
Whoa!

39:32.603 --> 39:33.703
Oh!

40:28.359 --> 40:30.360
Wow.

40:30.362 --> 40:32.662
Can't believe all that stuff happened in one day.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.664
That's the life of the sky, Nathan.

40:34.666 --> 40:38.368
Every day is an incredible
series of fun, memorable events.

40:38.370 --> 40:40.203
A montage, if you will.

40:40.205 --> 40:43.006
- It was amazing.
- I know.

40:43.008 --> 40:45.975
Although I did get strip
searched by a giant angry man.

40:45.977 --> 40:48.178
And severely shocked with defibrillator paddles.

40:48.180 --> 40:49.746
Yep, best job in the world.

40:49.748 --> 40:51.080
I also drank vomit.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.988
Oh, dear God.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.357
- What?
- Uh, I can't let that woman see me.

41:34.359 --> 41:35.839
- Why?
- Just...

41:37.661 --> 41:39.696
What the... Damn!

41:39.698 --> 41:42.732
I'm not comfortable with this.
Please, Larry...

41:42.734 --> 41:45.034
Yeah, Larry she's gone.
Larry, she's gone!

41:45.036 --> 41:47.837
- Okay. Okay.
- She's gone.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.400
That could've been really uncomfortable.

41:49.707 --> 41:52.208
Who was that?

41:52.210 --> 41:55.645
Nathan, I've said many times nobody
can ground this plane permanently,

41:56.547 --> 41:58.314
but she came the closest.

41:58.316 --> 42:00.817
<i>The year was 1998.</i>

42:00.819 --> 42:04.387
<i>I was on a weekend layover in LA and, well, you know,</i>

42:04.389 --> 42:07.891
<i>every great couple has a cute
story about how they met.</i>

42:08.626 --> 42:09.993
<i>We were no different.</i>

42:13.364 --> 42:15.565
<i>She was walking her dog, Muffin.</i>

42:15.567 --> 42:17.600
<i>The night before, I'd been thrown through</i>

42:17.602 --> 42:20.937
<i>a car windshield at 50 miles
an hour and left for dead.</i>

42:20.939 --> 42:24.807
<i>Boy, that little Muffin sure liked
to lick dried blood off a face.</i>

42:30.315 --> 42:32.582
<i>That charming April convinced an off-duty,</i>

42:32.584 --> 42:35.485
<i>and possibly drunk, ambulance driver to pick me up.</i>

42:35.487 --> 42:38.154
<i>And I was glad she did.</i>

42:38.156 --> 42:41.357
You're hot.
You wanna have dinner tonight?

42:44.896 --> 42:46.776
I'll pick you up at 7:00, all right?

42:50.267 --> 42:53.503
So, I'm all bandaged up, right? I
look her right in the eye and I say,

42:53.505 --> 42:56.039
"God, you're hot.
You wanna have dinner tonight?"

42:56.041 --> 42:58.908
- Um, Larry...
- Hello, storius interruptus much?

42:58.910 --> 43:00.577
- No, but she's...
- Butt cheese?

43:00.579 --> 43:03.579
Really, Nathan? Act your age,
not your weiner length, okay?

43:03.949 --> 43:08.851
<i>We went to one of those restaurants where
they cook everything at the table.</i>

43:08.853 --> 43:13.656
<i>We were given a truly authentic
Japanese experience by chef Hiro Obata</i>

43:13.658 --> 43:15.959
<i>Garcia Gonzalez de San Fernando.</i>

43:15.961 --> 43:17.827
<i>I think it may have been his first day.</i>

43:17.829 --> 43:20.330
So, uh, you grew up in LA?

43:20.332 --> 43:22.332
Hmm, well actually in the suburbs.

43:23.067 --> 43:24.133
Really? Me too.

43:24.135 --> 43:25.201
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

43:25.203 --> 43:26.402
- Oh.
- Yeah.

43:26.404 --> 43:29.505
Yeah, I loved it, you know, everything felt so safe.

43:29.507 --> 43:31.941
You could ride a bike to a friend's house

43:31.943 --> 43:34.104
without your parents being all worried about you.

43:34.812 --> 43:36.779
Totally, totally.

43:36.781 --> 43:38.301
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:39.650 --> 43:40.717
Yeah.

43:40.719 --> 43:42.051
Mmm-hmm.

43:45.589 --> 43:48.091
So what made you decide that you wanted to fly?

43:51.895 --> 43:55.732
Well, let's just say I wanted to escape
the pain of a father's abandonment.

43:55.734 --> 43:58.067
I wanted to escape the pain of a father's abandonment.

43:58.069 --> 44:00.310
Thank you.
I didn't think I could say that by myself.

44:10.080 --> 44:11.147
Hmm.

44:15.052 --> 44:16.119
Huh.

44:19.189 --> 44:20.590
It's crazy.

44:25.996 --> 44:27.697
So, do you believe in fate?

44:28.098 --> 44:30.433
Sure. Do you?

44:31.535 --> 44:33.469
How could I not?

44:33.471 --> 44:36.139
I mean, every day I walk Muffin down Elm Street,

44:36.141 --> 44:39.609
today I went down Maple, and there you were,

44:39.611 --> 44:41.444
unconscious on somebody's lawn.

44:41.446 --> 44:42.945
- Hmm.

44:42.947 --> 44:46.082
And usually I take a taxi back to my hotel room,

44:46.084 --> 44:48.418
but last night, I accepted a
ride from a complete stranger

44:48.420 --> 44:51.387
who reeked of alcohol and could
barely stand up straight.

44:51.389 --> 44:53.389
And if that hadn't happened, we would've never met.

44:53.391 --> 44:54.991
- I know.

44:54.993 --> 44:58.828
It's like that drunk driver was an
angel, sent down to watch over me.

44:58.830 --> 44:59.896
Yeah.

45:01.398 --> 45:03.833
I love you, drunk driver who almost killed me.

45:04.436 --> 45:11.040
<i>Now, without exaggeration, I've
made love to roughly 135,000 women.</i>

45:11.042 --> 45:14.203
<i>But there was something about April
that went beyond the physical.</i>

45:16.146 --> 45:18.815
I... Wow.

45:18.817 --> 45:22.151
I just can't believe how much we have in common.

45:22.153 --> 45:25.955
You know, um, we both are Scorpios,
we both love Japanese food.

45:25.957 --> 45:28.591
We both even have the same middle name.

45:28.593 --> 45:29.659
I know.

45:31.128 --> 45:34.664
You are amazing, Larry Elizabeth Gaye.

45:53.617 --> 45:55.852
<i>But despite how wonderfully everything was going,</i>

45:55.854 --> 45:57.854
<i>something just didn't feel right.</i>

46:05.195 --> 46:06.896
Do you have to go?

46:06.898 --> 46:08.865
No, I went when I woke up.

46:10.934 --> 46:13.336
So, when you come back to LA, will I see you?

46:13.338 --> 46:16.439
Look, I, um, the thing is...

46:19.409 --> 46:20.510
Yes.

46:21.945 --> 46:23.746
Yes, you will.

46:23.748 --> 46:25.114
You promise?

46:25.116 --> 46:27.683
I give you my word, I'll call you.

46:31.288 --> 46:33.189
Well, I didn't call her.

46:33.191 --> 46:37.193
Why not? Nathan, you know me.
I'm built to fly.

46:37.195 --> 46:38.595
And as great as April was, I just...

46:38.596 --> 46:40.630
I didn't think I could be fully
happy down on the ground.

46:40.632 --> 46:42.398
Then why didn't you have the guts to say that?

46:42.400 --> 46:44.767
Well, because... Turbulence.

46:45.969 --> 46:47.937
April.

46:47.939 --> 46:50.973
Boy, your ears must have been burning,
'cause I was just talking about you.

46:50.975 --> 46:52.175
How have you been?

46:52.177 --> 46:55.778
How have I been? Oh, gosh.
Uh, let's see.

46:55.780 --> 46:57.947
I work at a crappy hotel, where, um,

46:57.949 --> 47:01.184
I get hit on all day by shitheads who say
they're gonna call and they never do.

47:01.186 --> 47:02.485
How you been?

47:03.687 --> 47:06.956
Great, I've won six Golden Coffee Pots in a row.

47:06.958 --> 47:09.525
- This is my buddy, Nathan.
- Asshole.

47:09.527 --> 47:12.261
Hey, that's not really fair. You
didn't even give him a chance.

47:12.263 --> 47:13.930
- I think she meant you.
- No.

47:15.232 --> 47:17.733
Really?
April, wait!

47:21.104 --> 47:22.638
I'm sorry.

47:22.640 --> 47:24.874
I'm sorry.
I should never have done what I did.

47:24.876 --> 47:29.145
I guess what I'm trying to say is, what
I should've done is what I didn't.

47:29.147 --> 47:33.883
And what I did do is not the opposite of
what the unright thing to do would've been.

47:33.885 --> 47:36.552
- I understand. Okay.
- Okay, good.

47:36.554 --> 47:40.122
Um, in fact, why don't you, um...

47:41.758 --> 47:44.193
Why don't you come over tonight?

47:44.195 --> 47:48.130
We can, um, pick up where we left
of, you know, for old times' sake.

47:49.433 --> 47:55.571
Well, I guess I could drop my landing
gear, if you know what I mean.

47:55.573 --> 48:00.443
Put my tray table into its upright
position, if you know what I mean.

48:00.445 --> 48:03.279
Fit my wheelie bag into you overhead comp...

48:03.281 --> 48:04.714
I know what you mean.

48:04.716 --> 48:06.282
Okay, so I'll see you tonight, right?

48:06.284 --> 48:07.984
- Yes, you will.
- Okay.

48:42.119 --> 48:47.456
And this is the team that we have assembled
to fine tune the Flightpal's hard drive.

48:47.458 --> 48:51.227
Johann Kaminsky, Stuart Nevins and Token Black.

48:51.862 --> 48:54.797
Taequan Black. Taequan Black.

48:54.799 --> 48:57.033
Yes, of course it is.

48:57.035 --> 48:59.802
Now, Mr. Techtronics would like to see how it's going

48:59.804 --> 49:01.971
with our highest priority project.

49:01.973 --> 49:03.839
- Uh, fantastic.
- Right on target.

49:03.841 --> 49:06.075
- Couldn't ask for better.
- Well within parameters.

49:06.077 --> 49:07.243
Are you sure?

49:07.245 --> 49:10.012
Well, the technical stuff will be there,

49:10.014 --> 49:14.350
but there's a certain human instinct
that great flight attendants have,

49:14.352 --> 49:16.953
which we don't fully understand yet.

49:16.955 --> 49:18.955
I think I can help you with that.

49:20.424 --> 49:22.024
What?

49:22.026 --> 49:25.027
What's the matter with you boys?
Never seen a sexy woman before?

49:27.097 --> 49:29.332
- No, no.
- No, no. Not for free. No.

49:29.334 --> 49:31.934
Isabella here has done a little research for us.

49:33.737 --> 49:37.273
<i>Larry, I want to know the secrets of being</i>

49:37.275 --> 49:39.875
<i>the best flight attendant in the world.</i>

49:39.877 --> 49:43.079
<i>Wait, you're not gonna somehow
use this against me, are you?</i>

49:43.081 --> 49:45.281
<i>What?
No, of course not.</i>

49:45.283 --> 49:48.484
<i>No, I didn't mean to make you
uncomfortable, I just felt I had to ask.</i>

49:48.486 --> 49:51.654
<i>Anyway, all my secrets?
Where do I begin?</i>

49:58.996 --> 50:01.564
These tulips should go in water.

50:01.566 --> 50:05.401
And these two lips should go on a
self-guided tour of Mount April.

50:05.403 --> 50:08.337
Larry, you haven't changed a bit.

50:08.339 --> 50:13.009
Hey, if it ain't broke, don't
un-break it, if you know what I mean.

50:13.011 --> 50:14.877
- I don't. Um...
- Okay.

50:14.879 --> 50:18.080
Uh, Larry there is someone I'd like you to meet.

50:18.082 --> 50:21.484
- Mmm.
- So, um, just wait here.

50:21.486 --> 50:23.886
- That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
- Okay.

50:25.489 --> 50:26.889
Three-way.

50:32.963 --> 50:35.698
Huh, that's a different way to go.

50:37.901 --> 50:39.502
- Larry.
- Oh.

50:40.303 --> 50:41.470
This is Donnie.

50:42.406 --> 50:44.540
- What's up, man?
- He's your son.

50:44.542 --> 50:46.776
He's my what? Eh...

50:47.444 --> 50:48.744
Whoa.

50:48.746 --> 50:51.313
- May I have a word with you?
- Yeah.

50:54.518 --> 50:57.253
This can't be.
We only did it once.

50:57.821 --> 50:59.655
That was all it took.

50:59.657 --> 51:01.457
That's what I'm talking about.

51:02.159 --> 51:04.360
But how can you be sure he's mine?

51:07.664 --> 51:08.898
Turbulence.

51:16.606 --> 51:18.841
Hey, Donnie.

51:23.413 --> 51:25.114
Would you like some more?

51:25.116 --> 51:26.315
Don't mind if I do.

51:27.084 --> 51:28.217
Okay.

51:28.885 --> 51:30.786
Hmm. Mmm. No, no.

51:30.788 --> 51:32.088
Oh, okay.

51:54.111 --> 51:55.344
Oh, okay.

51:56.580 --> 51:57.847
Mmm.

51:57.849 --> 52:01.383
Oh, uh, convenient.

52:01.385 --> 52:03.612
Yeah, well, I don't have a lot of time to cook.

52:03.638 --> 52:04.587
I'm a single mother.

52:04.589 --> 52:05.721
As you know.

52:05.723 --> 52:07.490
Yeah, that's gotta be rough.

52:09.126 --> 52:12.695
So, Donnie, how's school? Uh, What...
What grade are you in?

52:14.798 --> 52:17.266
First? Wow, you gotta be one of the
bigger kids in the class, huh?

52:17.268 --> 52:19.468
No, Donnie, don't disrespect your father.

52:19.470 --> 52:20.769
He's not my father.

52:20.771 --> 52:22.471
Aha! The plot thickens.

52:22.473 --> 52:25.941
No, he means he doesn't accept you as a father.

52:26.943 --> 52:28.611
Oh. I see.

52:30.113 --> 52:33.649
Okay, look, Donnie. I don't blame
you for feeling angry towards me.

52:33.651 --> 52:36.685
If you don't want me to be a
part of your life, I understand.

52:37.220 --> 52:38.320
Good.

52:40.557 --> 52:42.158
It's just as well.

52:42.160 --> 52:45.094
Flying the LA to Chicago route
first thing in the morning anyway.

52:45.096 --> 52:47.596
I'm... I'm sorry again.

52:47.598 --> 52:49.965
- About... About everything.
- Mmm-hmm.

52:51.635 --> 52:52.801
Wait.

52:53.737 --> 52:55.604
Dad, are you a pilot?

52:57.207 --> 53:01.944
Wait, um, your mother didn't
tell you what I do for a living?

53:01.946 --> 53:04.146
She's never told me anything about you.

53:04.148 --> 53:07.183
I've always dreamed of having a dad who was a pilot.

53:07.185 --> 53:10.219
Son, that look of wide-eyed adoration on
your face makes it hard for me to admit

53:10.221 --> 53:12.755
- that I'm only a fly...
- Please say pilot.

53:12.757 --> 53:16.325
Ing man. Meaning pilot.
I'm a pilot. I'm a pilot.

53:16.327 --> 53:19.828
That is so cool. That's what
I wanna be when I grow up.

53:19.830 --> 53:21.931
Tell me everything about it.
Every single detail.

53:21.933 --> 53:23.799
Son, there is nothing like the feeling

53:23.801 --> 53:26.335
of guiding that bird up to 36,000 feet.

53:26.337 --> 53:27.970
Someday you'll come up with me.

53:27.972 --> 53:32.141
Okay. Why don't you two keep talking,
I'm gonna get dessert ready, okay?

53:32.143 --> 53:33.442
Okay.

53:36.413 --> 53:38.647
Wow, there's just so much I didn't know.

53:38.649 --> 53:40.583
Well, now you do.

53:41.751 --> 53:42.985
Any questions?

53:42.987 --> 53:47.089
Yeah, uh, can you still do it
if there's only one girl?

53:47.091 --> 53:49.158
Good question, Son.

53:49.160 --> 53:52.861
And the answer, believe it or not, is yes.

53:52.863 --> 53:54.330
I mean, she won't always have a hot roommate

53:54.332 --> 53:56.565
or a college friend visiting from out of town.

53:56.567 --> 53:59.034
On those occasions, you have to make it work.

53:59.036 --> 54:01.237
And where can I get one of these swings?

54:01.239 --> 54:04.607
There are catalogs. Online sex shops.
I had mine custom made in Bangkok.

54:04.609 --> 54:08.744
But remember, install it properly.
And test it out.

54:08.746 --> 54:10.746
Because you always wanna have...

54:11.648 --> 54:12.948
Safe sex.

54:12.950 --> 54:16.418
Atta boy. That's my boy.
Anything else?

54:16.420 --> 54:18.153
Yeah, just one thing.

54:18.155 --> 54:23.826
Should you still do it if you and
the girl are, like, in love?

54:23.828 --> 54:27.029
Hmm. I'm gonna have to say no on that one, Son.

54:27.031 --> 54:29.765
There can be a lot of strings attached.

54:29.767 --> 54:33.902
But you know what? You're only 13.
You have so much to learn.

54:33.904 --> 54:35.804
I just... I wanted you to have the basics.

54:35.806 --> 54:37.339
Thanks, Dad.
I really appreciate it.

54:37.341 --> 54:39.008
Hey, you got it.

54:39.010 --> 54:42.911
Now bring it in here.
Huh? All right. That's my boy.

54:47.918 --> 54:49.318
Oh.

54:49.320 --> 54:51.353
Hey, what are you guys doing in here?

54:51.355 --> 54:53.722
Uh, just a little father-son bondage.

54:55.358 --> 54:59.361
Okay. Uh, Donnie, I'm afraid that
it's time for you to go to bed.

54:59.363 --> 55:01.563
- Aww.
- Can Dad stay over?

55:03.433 --> 55:06.201
- If you like, yeah, he can stay.
- Sweet.

55:06.203 --> 55:09.471
The living room? I mean, what
if the kid walks in on us?

55:10.940 --> 55:13.208
Hmm, I don't know.

55:22.419 --> 55:24.420
Oh, um, don't forget to lock that.

55:24.422 --> 55:26.902
It's broken, it tends to release.
So if you...

55:27.357 --> 55:29.224
Yeah, I think I got it.

55:33.997 --> 55:38.400
So, how come you never tried to
find me and tell me about Donnie?

55:39.569 --> 55:43.205
Um, well, because I was...
I was really angry.

55:43.973 --> 55:46.909
Angry at you for leaving,

55:46.911 --> 55:50.546
and I didn't think you deserved
a son as great as Donnie,

55:50.548 --> 55:52.081
and I don't know, I guess when I saw you at the pool,

55:52.083 --> 55:54.883
I thought maybe the time had come.

55:54.885 --> 55:59.021
Well, April, I wanna do my part.

55:59.023 --> 56:02.057
From now on, I'll give you half my salary for him.

56:02.059 --> 56:05.260
Well, I'll give you 25% of my salary for him.

56:05.262 --> 56:08.897
And on his birthday, well, I'll pick
him out something from the sky mall.

56:08.899 --> 56:11.667
A sleep mask, a neck pillow.

56:11.669 --> 56:13.402
Perhaps some nice compression leg sleeves,

56:13.404 --> 56:15.838
ideal for improved circulation on longer flights.

56:15.840 --> 56:18.774
Okay, I think what he'd really like
to have is a father in the picture.

56:18.776 --> 56:23.312
I know. You've got to get out there and
start dating while you're still hot.

56:23.314 --> 56:24.446
I meant you.

56:25.148 --> 56:26.215
Oh.

56:27.717 --> 56:31.320
Look, I... I know that it's a lot to ask,

56:31.322 --> 56:36.859
but if you, I don't know, if you ever stop
flying and settle in the area, you...

56:36.861 --> 56:39.128
You could really be a big part of his life.

56:39.130 --> 56:41.296
Yeah, but how would I even earn a living?

56:41.298 --> 56:44.400
I mean, sure, I could open a
studio and teach the Macarena,

56:44.402 --> 56:47.002
but that craze isn't gonna last forever.

56:47.004 --> 56:48.871
April, let's face it.

56:48.873 --> 56:52.875
If you couldn't keep me on the
ground, well, nothing could.

56:54.177 --> 56:56.612
Okay, well, just think about it.

56:57.614 --> 56:58.680
Okay.

57:05.522 --> 57:06.688
Oh, not right now?

57:08.658 --> 57:09.958
Just think about it.

57:09.960 --> 57:12.428
Better yet, I'll think about it.

57:12.430 --> 57:13.695
- Okay.
- Okay.

57:13.697 --> 57:15.664
Good night, Larry.

57:15.666 --> 57:18.534
Hey, uh, maybe we could have sex.

57:19.335 --> 57:21.437
If you know what I mean.

57:21.439 --> 57:24.306
Okay, if you say the actual thing,
then you don't need to say,

57:24.308 --> 57:26.108
"If you know what I mean."

57:26.110 --> 57:27.609
Is that a yes?

57:27.611 --> 57:28.844
That's a no.

57:28.846 --> 57:29.945
- Got it.
- Okay.

57:29.947 --> 57:31.213
All right.

57:52.135 --> 57:53.302
Oh.

57:59.509 --> 58:01.076
I said no, Larry.

58:02.378 --> 58:03.445
Oh.

58:09.786 --> 58:11.220
Morning, Son.

58:11.222 --> 58:15.557
Morning, woman with whom passionate
unprotected fling resulted in son.

58:16.292 --> 58:17.693
Morning.

58:17.695 --> 58:19.194
Where's your hat, Dad?

58:19.196 --> 58:22.598
- What hat?
- Your pilot's hat.

58:22.600 --> 58:27.402
Oh, right. I don't like to wear it
when I'm not flying. Too pilot-y.

58:27.404 --> 58:30.138
Which I am, of course.
Pilot. I'm a pilot.

58:30.140 --> 58:32.674
Wait, why is your tie tucked into your shirt?

58:32.676 --> 58:35.711
I thought only loser stewardesses did that.

58:35.713 --> 58:36.778
Flight attendants.

58:38.548 --> 58:42.384
Is what those losers prefer to be called,

58:42.386 --> 58:45.554
and this tie-tuck is my way of mocking them.

58:45.556 --> 58:48.090
Losers.
Come on, I'll walk you to school.

58:48.092 --> 58:49.858
Oh, actually, I ride a bike.

58:49.860 --> 58:51.226
Not a problem.

58:55.164 --> 58:58.333
Hey, Dad. When I grow up, can
I be a pilot just like you?

58:58.335 --> 59:01.069
Of course you can.
You can be anything you want, Son.

59:01.071 --> 59:04.473
Just follow your dreams and go wherever they take you.

59:04.475 --> 59:08.443
The good ones, not the weird ones,
like when you're naked at a funeral.

59:08.445 --> 59:09.945
Or naked at a petting zoo.

59:09.947 --> 59:11.947
I got it. Thanks, Dad.

59:11.949 --> 59:13.048
You got it, Son.

59:17.086 --> 59:18.453
Let me get that for you, Son.

59:18.455 --> 59:20.689
- Thanks, Dad.
- Sure. Straight in there.

59:20.691 --> 59:23.058
Hey, look.
It's Donnie Girlparts.

59:23.060 --> 59:25.260
How's your vagina today, Donnie?

59:25.262 --> 59:26.495
Son, you have a vagina?

59:26.497 --> 59:28.330
God, the surprises just keep coming.

59:28.332 --> 59:31.266
No, Dad.
They pick on me 'cause they think I'm a wuss.

59:31.268 --> 59:33.068
It's no big deal, okay?

59:33.070 --> 59:34.870
I beg to differ.

59:34.872 --> 59:36.872
Hey, you.

59:36.874 --> 59:39.374
This young man here, he's a Gaye.

59:39.376 --> 59:41.743
And when you mess with a Gaye,

59:41.745 --> 59:43.812
you mess with Gayes everywhere.

59:43.814 --> 59:46.748
And some of us Gayes have a vicious temper.
You feel me?

59:46.750 --> 59:48.216
You feel me on that?

59:49.652 --> 59:50.719
Scram!

59:54.625 --> 59:55.691
Thanks, Dad.

59:55.693 --> 59:58.093
Hey, it's what dads do.

59:59.362 --> 01:00:03.398
So, are you gonna be, like,
staying with us from now on?

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:06.602
Well, actually, Son, I...

01:00:08.004 --> 01:00:10.439
I... I will.

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:12.674
Of course I will.

01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:15.477
What, do you think I'm just gonna
abandon you like my own father did?

01:00:15.479 --> 01:00:17.679
That I'm gonna choose an empty, transient existence

01:00:17.681 --> 01:00:20.716
over a meaningful life with a family that loves me?

01:00:20.718 --> 01:00:23.285
What do you got for a guy who chose
an empty transient existence

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:27.623
- over a meaningful life with a family that loves him?
- Scotch?

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:30.826
- No, I'm American.
- Sorry, you look Scotch.

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:39.668
- You're Gaye, right?
- Yeah.

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:42.904
Thought so.
You remind me of your dad.

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:48.443
Ugh!

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:12.134
Well, Cecile it looks like your
award-winning flight attendant

01:01:12.136 --> 01:01:15.837
- is 30 minutes late.
- That's the type of human error

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:19.441
that you never have to worry about with the Flightpal.

01:01:19.443 --> 01:01:22.744
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. Larry's coming, I know he is.
- Uh-huh.

01:01:22.746 --> 01:01:24.413
Well, he's about 30 minutes late.

01:01:24.415 --> 01:01:26.214
- Well, maybe he's stuck in traffic, I don't know.
- Really?

01:01:26.216 --> 01:01:29.251
- I don't think he's ever gonna show up.
- Trust me, he's a hero.

01:01:29.253 --> 01:01:31.386
- Mmm-hmm.
- He's gonna save all of our jobs.

01:01:31.388 --> 01:01:34.990
- I ran out on my own son, everyone.

01:01:34.992 --> 01:01:40.228
Yes, I did.
Just like my own father ran out on me.

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:45.767
The sins of the fathers laid
on the children of the corn.

01:01:45.769 --> 01:01:48.937
'Cause I had a chance to stop the
cycle of abandonment. Did I? Did I?

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.139
Larry!

01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:52.661
- No, it's Jack.
- Larry.

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.944
Oh, boy, this isn't optimal.

01:01:57.146 --> 01:02:00.415
- Okay, all right, listen to me.
- Okay.

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:01.616
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:02:01.618 --> 01:02:03.652
I want you to take all this shame, okay,

01:02:03.654 --> 01:02:05.821
all this pain that you're feeling right now,

01:02:05.823 --> 01:02:08.056
and let's use it, let's channel it.

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:09.758
Let's focus it.

01:02:11.427 --> 01:02:14.296
Thank you, Nathan.
I needed that.

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:20.769
Phew!

01:02:21.604 --> 01:02:22.838
My God, you're hot.

01:02:24.273 --> 01:02:26.675
Look, I've got a full-on dinosaur bone in my pants,

01:02:26.677 --> 01:02:28.478
and it's not going away any time soon.

01:02:30.346 --> 01:02:33.115
Yeah, let's do this.

01:02:39.856 --> 01:02:41.356
Attendants ready.

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:44.459
- And go!

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:50.599
And brew!

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.143
Good.

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:56.531
Oh!

01:03:56.533 --> 01:03:58.733
Ow!

01:04:10.914 --> 01:04:12.247
Here we go, are you ready for this?

01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:13.849
- Yeah!
- All right, she's just a sexy robot.

01:04:13.851 --> 01:04:16.117
Just a sexy robot.
You're Larry Gaye.

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:18.854
Go! Go get her.

01:04:21.724 --> 01:04:23.225
What does this test measure?

01:04:23.227 --> 01:04:25.627
We just thought it'd be fun to watch.

01:04:25.629 --> 01:04:26.862
- Okay.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.920
Move!

01:04:51.922 --> 01:04:53.121
Oh!

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:08.236
Nathan!

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:11.640
- Nathan!
- Right here.

01:05:11.642 --> 01:05:15.343
Nathan, Nathan, I've done it, Nathan.

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:19.080
- I've done it.
- No, you didn't.

01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:22.196
- I didn't?
- You didn't.

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:24.152
- Oh.
- It was ugly.

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:25.587
Oh.

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:32.861
- Okay, Nate, so how am I doing?
- All right, I've got you down

01:05:32.863 --> 01:05:36.765
30 points to none.

01:05:36.767 --> 01:05:40.068
- With one event left.
- Huh. I felt it was closer than that.

01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:43.171
- It's not.
- Well, how can I possibly make up 30 points?

01:05:43.173 --> 01:05:45.173
<i>Because customer service is so important,</i>

01:05:45.175 --> 01:05:47.242
<i>this final event is worth 31 points.</i>

01:05:47.244 --> 01:05:48.543
- Hmm.
- Wow, that's convenient.

01:05:48.545 --> 01:05:53.248
<i>We're going to present a customer service
problem and see who can best solve it.</i>

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:55.550
<i>It's dinner time we have two entrees,</i>

01:05:55.552 --> 01:05:58.253
<i>barbeque chicken and pasta primavera.</i>

01:05:58.255 --> 01:06:00.722
<i>The problem is, you're all out of pasta.</i>

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:05.193
Good evening, folks, for dinner we have

01:06:05.195 --> 01:06:08.730
barbeque chicken or stewed muskrat testicles.

01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:10.966
- I'll have the chicken.
- Of course you will.

01:06:12.368 --> 01:06:15.670
I have barbeque chicken or vomit encrusted rat legs.

01:06:15.672 --> 01:06:18.106
Barbeque chicken.
- Now, that's programing.

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:22.510
Uh, barbeque chicken or the

01:06:22.512 --> 01:06:27.749
sauteed anus of a skunk served on a
bed of the anuses of other skunks.

01:06:27.751 --> 01:06:29.517
I'll take the chicken.

01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:33.555
Barbeque chicken or toe nail fungus in a
broth of hobo saliva and crotch sweat.

01:06:33.557 --> 01:06:37.425
Barbeque chicken or, uh, bubonic plague

01:06:37.427 --> 01:06:40.395
garnished with pigeon droppings
and the hand-fluffed pubes

01:06:40.397 --> 01:06:43.765
of a fat, old eczema sufferer who just ran a 10k.

01:06:43.767 --> 01:06:45.300
Chicken sounds good.
- Yeah.

01:06:45.302 --> 01:06:48.203
Barbeque chicken or dingleberry-crusted rat tartar

01:06:48.205 --> 01:06:52.440
drizzled with pus, served with a
warm mug of curdled liposuction fat.

01:06:52.442 --> 01:06:53.842
Chicken, please.
- Um...

01:06:53.844 --> 01:06:57.879
Barbeque chicken or...
Or, um...

01:06:57.881 --> 01:07:02.384
- Or lobster. I...
- Oh, I'll have the lobster.

01:07:02.386 --> 01:07:05.387
Yeah, fuck chicken, I want the lobster too.
- I don't have lobster.

01:07:05.389 --> 01:07:07.605
I only have barbeque chicken.
I couldn't think

01:07:07.631 --> 01:07:09.491
of anything else disgusting.
I give up.

01:07:09.493 --> 01:07:11.259
Larry Gaye gives up.

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:17.265
I am amazed.

01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:20.969
I am amazed.

01:07:20.971 --> 01:07:24.172
<i>The winner, by a score of 61 points to zero,</i>

01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:27.208
<i>-is Sally the Flightpal.</i>

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:35.884
Ugh!

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:40.355
I don't know how you lost.
You were down by 30 points.

01:07:40.357 --> 01:07:43.291
But when they said the last event was
for 31, I thought for sure you'd win.

01:07:43.293 --> 01:07:46.261
Nah, things like that only
happen in the movies, Nathan.

01:07:46.263 --> 01:07:47.896
This is real life.

01:07:47.898 --> 01:07:49.697
But how did she know how to do that with the arm tray?

01:07:49.699 --> 01:07:52.267
I mean, it's like she knew my every move.
But how?

01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:54.502
Isabella.

01:07:56.939 --> 01:08:00.508
The woman who seduced me and with
whom I shared all my secrets,

01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:02.977
and then never heard from again.

01:08:02.979 --> 01:08:06.681
You came to support me. I'm truly
touched, that is so sweet.

01:08:06.683 --> 01:08:08.016
I don't think that's what happened, Lar.

01:08:08.018 --> 01:08:10.318
I think she plied you for information

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.754
- and used it against you.
- Oh.

01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:15.623
Pardon my sidekick, he's embarrassingly naive.

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:19.260
- How have you been?
- Oh, no, he's right, Larry. I'm sorry.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:22.596
You deceiving tramp. I never
wanna see your lying face again.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:27.335
My God, you are so hot! Any
chance you're free for dinner?

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:31.139
- No.
- Lunch, tomorrow? Breakfast?

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.140
God! I'm such an idiot!

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.877
I've ruined flight attending for everyone.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.581
Everyone! <i> Everyone!</i>

01:08:51.993 --> 01:08:54.295
<i>You can be anything you want, Son.
Just follow your dreams</i>

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.865
<i>and go wherever they take you.</i>

01:08:56.867 --> 01:08:59.600
- <i> Federated Airlines.</i>

01:08:59.603 --> 01:09:04.839
Hi, this is Larry Gaye. I seem to
have forgotten my next assignment.

01:09:04.841 --> 01:09:06.640
Could you tell me where my next flight is?

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:08.510
<i>Oh, hi, Larry, it's Cristal.</i>

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:12.346
<i>You've got Flight 37 to Buenos Aires,
leaves San Fran tonight at 10:00.</i>

01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:16.451
- Thank you.
- <i>Hey, Larry, what are you wearing?</i>

01:09:16.453 --> 01:09:20.188
- Jeans and a hoodie from GAP kids.
- <i>Okay.</i>

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:36.504
- Okay, have a nice flight.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:09:37.872 --> 01:09:41.009
- May I help you?
- Hi, can I get a ticket from Los Angeles

01:09:41.011 --> 01:09:43.444
to San Francisco, and continuing on from San Francisco

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:45.145
to Buenos Aires, please?

01:09:45.148 --> 01:09:48.249
Sorry, I'm not allowed to sell
tickets to unaccompanied minors.

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:58.459
I'd like a ticket from Los Angeles to
San Francisco, then on to Buenos Aires.

01:09:58.461 --> 01:10:02.063
Sorry, I'm not allowed to sell
tickets to unaccompanied miners.

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:05.466
Oh, no, actually we're together.
So...

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:07.802
Oh, perfect!

01:10:24.587 --> 01:10:27.922
Jeez. What happened?
Who brought herpes to the orgy?

01:10:27.924 --> 01:10:29.390
Larry, look.

01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:35.930
- She has herpes? Thanks for the heads-up.
- No!

01:10:35.932 --> 01:10:39.300
That's the Flightpal. They say
within a year, we'll all be gone.

01:10:39.302 --> 01:10:42.136
- It's devastating.
- You say that like it's my fault.

01:10:42.138 --> 01:10:46.507
As if I lost some sort of flight
attending contest to save our jobs.

01:10:46.509 --> 01:10:48.610
You did.
That's exactly what happened.

01:10:48.612 --> 01:10:51.613
- Disagree not to agree.
- You're just combining words.

01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:52.981
Correctly.

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:06.261
- Sir, can I get you a drink?
- Bourbon, rocks.

01:11:06.263 --> 01:11:09.197
It sure does, but I'm afraid I
can't serve alcohol to miners.

01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:13.768
- Sparkling water.
- Very well.

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:20.108
- Sir, can I get you a... Son?
- Dad!

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:23.144
What are you doing here?

01:11:23.146 --> 01:11:26.114
Well, I took your advice. You
told me to follow my dreams,

01:11:26.116 --> 01:11:28.616
and my dreams are to fly and be with you.

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:31.152
Donnie, I can't be a part of this.

01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:32.553
I mean, your mother's probably worried sick.

01:11:32.555 --> 01:11:35.456
You get off this plane and go home, this minute.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:37.625
- We're at 32,000 feet.
- Right.

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:39.927
Whatever you do, do not get off this plane,

01:11:39.929 --> 01:11:43.398
but we're gonna talk more about
this when we get to Buenos Aires.

01:11:44.199 --> 01:11:45.300
Hey, Dad?

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:48.670
What are you doing back here serving drinks?

01:11:48.672 --> 01:11:51.172
Aren't you supposed to be up front in the cockpit?

01:11:53.143 --> 01:11:56.144
And that's how you serve a drink,

01:11:56.146 --> 01:11:58.479
you lowly, wussified flight attendant.

01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:00.815
God! Don't make me come
back here and show you again.

01:12:00.817 --> 01:12:03.885
- I'm way too busy flying the plane.
- But, Larry...

01:12:03.887 --> 01:12:07.155
Larry? Who's Larry? I'm not Larry.
It's Captain Gaye to you.

01:12:07.157 --> 01:12:10.425
Hey! That's my nickname.

01:12:10.427 --> 01:12:14.595
Huh. Okay.
I've gotta get back to work.

01:12:14.597 --> 01:12:18.833
In the cockpit, of course. Which
is where I belong, being a pilot.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:20.001
I'm a pilot.

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:35.216
- Look who it is.

01:12:37.152 --> 01:12:38.993
What are you doing up here, Gaye?

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:43.825
My son is on board and he doesn't know I'm only a...

01:12:43.827 --> 01:12:45.526
- Flying waitress?
- Sissy man?

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:47.495
Ass pansy?

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:50.698
Come on, guys.
Give me a break, okay?

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.901
Just let me stay up here for a
while so he doesn't find out.

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:56.904
Can't help you, Gaye.
It's against regulations.

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:09.617
Hey, why is our fuel level dropping precipitously?

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:12.487
I don't know.

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:20.628
Good night.

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:26.768
Donnie?

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:40.415
<i>Dear Mom, sorry to sneak out,
but I had to go find Dad.</i>

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:42.383
<i>I rigged the CD recording to start playing</i>

01:13:42.385 --> 01:13:44.519
<i>when you picked up that blank piece of paper.</i>

01:13:44.521 --> 01:13:45.987
<i>Hope it all worked.</i>

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:48.189
Oh, my God.

01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:59.600
Uh, Lar? We were supposed to start
dinner service an hour ago.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:02.069
Hey, I think we can wait a while.

01:14:02.071 --> 01:14:05.506
Larry, you can't avoid facing the
truth with your son forever.

01:14:05.508 --> 01:14:08.309
He'll accept you whether you're a pilot

01:14:08.311 --> 01:14:10.978
- or a flight attendant.
- That's really great advice, Nate.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:14.749
Sally, would you mind covering dinner
in coach for me with Nathan here?

01:14:14.751 --> 01:14:18.119
I'm just... I'm trying to avoid being seen.
It's a long story.

01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:19.353
But I was assigned to first class.

01:14:19.355 --> 01:14:22.924
- Come on, have a heart.
- But I don't have a heart.

01:14:22.926 --> 01:14:25.593
- Do you have to take everything so literally?
- Yes.

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:33.134
- Fine. Fine.
- Dinner?

01:14:36.506 --> 01:14:38.139
Must be a break in one of the lines.

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:41.108
According to this, we're losing fuel like crazy.

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:43.978
This is Federated Flight 37, we've got a situation.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.614
Chicken and rice, please.

01:14:49.718 --> 01:14:53.488
Uh, ma'am, we have baked ziti
and chicken with wild rice.

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:55.490
Chicken and rice, please.
- Dad?

01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:00.161
- Oh.
- Dad, are you really a pilot?

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:03.364
Yeah, I'm just helping out while
the plane's on autopilot.

01:15:03.366 --> 01:15:06.100
- <i>Folks, we've just switched off autopilot,</i>

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:08.536
<i>we're expecting some possible turbulence.</i>

01:15:08.538 --> 01:15:11.973
Oh, that's Felder, my co-pilot,
and I am his captain.

01:15:11.975 --> 01:15:14.242
<i>Uh...
This is Captain Bryce,</i>

01:15:14.244 --> 01:15:15.843
<i>just want to let you know you're in good hands</i>

01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:17.912
<i>with me and my co-pilot, Felder, up here.</i>

01:15:17.914 --> 01:15:20.181
<i>It's the two of us flying this plane,</i>

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:23.384
<i>definitely no one else in the cockpit.</i>

01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:26.888
Dad?

01:15:27.789 --> 01:15:29.924
Oh, Son, you're too smart for me.

01:15:29.926 --> 01:15:31.392
I'm...

01:15:32.327 --> 01:15:34.161
I'm a...

01:15:34.163 --> 01:15:35.496
I'm a flight attendant.

01:15:37.332 --> 01:15:39.700
Why did you lie to me?

01:15:39.702 --> 01:15:43.905
I just felt that if you knew, you'd
judge me or think less of me.

01:15:43.907 --> 01:15:45.273
I guess it was just my own insecurity.

01:15:45.275 --> 01:15:46.541
I should have given you more credit.

01:15:46.543 --> 01:15:48.442
You pussy! You're pathetic!

01:15:48.444 --> 01:15:51.812
Okay, my dad's a waitress with wings.
A sissy man.

01:15:51.814 --> 01:15:54.148
Don't forget ass pansy.

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:07.328
<i>Uh...</i>

01:16:07.931 --> 01:16:11.660
<i>At this time, we'd like to ask flight attendant</i>

01:16:11.686 --> 01:16:14.535
<i>Larry Gaye to report to the cockpit.</i>

01:16:14.537 --> 01:16:17.305
<i>To all you passengers, nothing to worry about,</i>

01:16:17.307 --> 01:16:20.207
<i>certainly no blown fuel lines or</i>

01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:21.976
<i>anything of that nature.</i>

01:16:26.381 --> 01:16:28.382
Gaye, we think the main fuel line is blown,

01:16:28.384 --> 01:16:31.185
and we might have to make an emergency landing.

01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:35.089
And, well, neither of us have
actually ever done one before.

01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:37.725
And back in flight school, you were the best at it.

01:16:37.727 --> 01:16:40.227
So, we're sorry.

01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:42.563
You gotta help us, Larry.
We're scared.

01:16:42.565 --> 01:16:47.435
You spent all those years abusing me,
and now, all of a sudden, you need me.

01:16:47.437 --> 01:16:51.639
I don't know, guys, I mean, I'm
just a lowly waitress with wings.

01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:55.176
A sissy man, an ass pansy, if you will.

01:16:55.178 --> 01:16:58.946
How could I possibly help you
big, strong, superior pilots?

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:01.349
Look, we're sorry for all the stuff that we ever said.

01:17:01.351 --> 01:17:03.017
Yeah, yeah, we never meant it.

01:17:03.019 --> 01:17:05.519
You know, I do.
I say these things sometimes.

01:17:05.521 --> 01:17:07.188
- Well...
- I don't know why.

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:10.891
- All right, it's okay.
- I'm not a good person, Larry.

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:13.961
- I forgive you. Now...
- My mom didn't hold me enough,

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:17.131
and when she did, it was always at a weird distance.

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:18.532
Like...

01:17:19.668 --> 01:17:23.404
The way you'd hold a spool of barbed wire,

01:17:23.406 --> 01:17:27.341
or an angry raccoon, not a lonely little boy.

01:17:27.343 --> 01:17:31.245
Maybe to compensate, my grandmother
was overly affectionate.

01:17:31.247 --> 01:17:35.049
She would hold me tight against her ample bosom,

01:17:35.051 --> 01:17:39.754
keep me nestled in there long after
it became difficult to breathe.

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:41.455
And yet,

01:17:42.624 --> 01:17:44.258
on one level,

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:47.628
I think I liked it.

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:50.564
She smelled like nutmeg.
Autumn.

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:53.701
Okay, guys, listen, we need...

01:17:53.703 --> 01:17:55.069
I once pleasured myself

01:17:55.071 --> 01:17:58.105
to the image of my grandma jumping on a trampoline.

01:18:01.209 --> 01:18:02.877
I will help land the plane.

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:06.080
Up.

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:14.021
Oh, but first, Captain Felder,
I'll need a cup of coffee.

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:18.159
One sugar and just a skosh of cream.

01:18:19.828 --> 01:18:22.563
Federated 37 to ground control.

01:18:22.565 --> 01:18:24.965
<i>Come in, Bryce.
You got Herb Donkins here.</i>

01:18:24.967 --> 01:18:26.767
Actually, there's been a slight change, Herb.

01:18:26.769 --> 01:18:28.969
From now on, the man you'll be talking to is Gaye.

01:18:28.971 --> 01:18:32.273
<i>Oh! Well, good for you, Bryce.
Have you told your wife?</i>

01:18:32.275 --> 01:18:34.408
No, Larry Gaye.
I'm a flight attendant,

01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:36.043
and I'm gonna bring this bird down.

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:37.978
<i>Well, that's against FAA rules.</i>

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:42.583
Look, if you want these people
on the ground in one piece,

01:18:42.585 --> 01:18:46.353
then I'm bringing her down.
Now, here's what I'm thinking.

01:18:46.355 --> 01:18:49.006
If we have enough fuel to reach the ocean...

01:18:49.032 --> 01:18:49.890
-<i> Larry...</i>

01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:53.828
- What? Hello? Hello?
- <i>Larry?</i>

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:56.163
Come in.
Come in, damn it.

01:18:56.165 --> 01:18:58.032
Okay, you don't have to yell.

01:18:58.034 --> 01:18:59.834
I left room in case you want some more cream.

01:18:59.836 --> 01:19:01.368
I can't hear a damn thing!

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:04.038
I said I left room in case you
want to add some more cream!

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:05.506
Damn it! Where'd you go?

01:19:05.508 --> 01:19:07.842
To get coffee, like you asked me to!

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:11.345
Would you like some Chardonnay?

01:19:11.347 --> 01:19:14.181
- <i> Or perhaps some Cabernet-Franc</i>
- What the hell is that?

01:19:14.183 --> 01:19:16.817
It's a combination of Cabernet and Merlot,

01:19:16.819 --> 01:19:20.321
pairs well with savory meats like pork, lamb.

01:19:20.323 --> 01:19:21.889
The signals are crossed with the Flightpal.

01:19:21.891 --> 01:19:23.157
That's why we've lost our radio.

01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:25.039
Somebody's gotta take out the Flightpal.

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.994
Bryce, hold our course.

01:19:26.996 --> 01:19:28.095
I'll be right back.

01:19:34.402 --> 01:19:37.872
- Coffee smells good.
- Don't touch anything.

01:19:37.874 --> 01:19:39.740
Hey, Larry, what the hell is going on?

01:19:39.742 --> 01:19:41.108
What's this about a blown fuel line?

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:42.209
No time to explain.

01:19:49.919 --> 01:19:51.919
Take that, robot bitch.

01:19:51.921 --> 01:19:53.921
Uh, Larry.

01:19:53.923 --> 01:19:55.055
That's not her.

01:19:55.057 --> 01:19:56.497
- No?
- No.

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:00.861
There you are.

01:20:00.863 --> 01:20:03.164
- May I help you?
- Yes, you may.

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:14.441
I said power down all electronic devices.

01:20:19.414 --> 01:20:21.348
Dad, what's goin' on?

01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:23.751
Son, how would you like to come up to the cockpit

01:20:23.753 --> 01:20:27.855
and watch your old man attempt an
incredibly dangerous emergency landing?

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:38.666
This is Federated 37 to ground control.
Come in, ground control.

01:20:38.668 --> 01:20:41.335
<i>Uh, we read you, Larry, but
you're dropping like a stone.</i>

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:44.972
According to our gauge, we have
about 30 miles of air left.

01:20:44.974 --> 01:20:46.974
We're about 30 miles from Los Angeles.

01:20:46.976 --> 01:20:48.909
Then that's where we're going.

01:20:48.911 --> 01:20:50.811
Can we get clearance at LAX?

01:20:50.813 --> 01:20:53.247
Okay, we're gonna clear all runways.
Take your pick.

01:20:53.249 --> 01:20:57.284
Wait, um, would it make more sense to put
the plane towards a less populated area,

01:20:57.286 --> 01:20:59.353
in case we don't have enough fuel to make it?

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:01.789
Son, this is no time for naive questions.

01:21:01.791 --> 01:21:04.258
It's time for heroic yet impulsive actions.

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.527
Now remember, every second...

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:11.532
- Larry?
- Dad?

01:21:14.769 --> 01:21:16.971
Yeah, he's, um...
He's 13 years old,

01:21:16.973 --> 01:21:18.672
and I think he's on one of your flights.

01:21:18.674 --> 01:21:20.241
<i>And in a bizarre turn of events, we've learned that</i>

01:21:20.243 --> 01:21:22.676
- <i>a flight attendant is going to attempt...</i>
- Do you know Larry Gaye?

01:21:22.678 --> 01:21:25.346
- He could be with him, right?
- <i>...an emergency landing at LAX.</i>

01:21:25.348 --> 01:21:27.281
<i>As this harrowing story develops,</i>

01:21:27.283 --> 01:21:30.317
<i>we're joined by flight attendant Steven Slater.</i>

01:21:30.319 --> 01:21:31.785
<i>Hi, Tanya, great to be here.</i>

01:21:31.787 --> 01:21:32.887
<i>He's the former...</i>

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.928
Cheese and crackers, how did we get so low?

01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:42.296
You fell asleep.

01:21:42.298 --> 01:21:44.265
<i>Larry, you are eight miles from LAX.</i>

01:21:44.267 --> 01:21:45.966
<i>How much fuel do you have left?</i>

01:21:45.968 --> 01:21:48.569
Uh, not eight miles' worth.

01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:51.071
There's only one thing we can do.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:53.274
- Urban Landing.
- Don't be an idiot.

01:21:53.276 --> 01:21:55.376
- It's far too risky.
- It's never been done.

01:21:57.178 --> 01:21:59.179
Nathan, I need you up here now.

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:01.749
Herb, we can't make it to the airport.

01:22:01.751 --> 01:22:03.984
I'm going to bring her down in the city.

01:22:03.986 --> 01:22:07.054
Passengers are kind of freakin'
out back there. So I thought...

01:22:07.056 --> 01:22:08.322
Get your priorities straight, Nathan.

01:22:08.324 --> 01:22:10.157
This is gonna be huge.

01:22:10.159 --> 01:22:11.592
Herb, did you read me?

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:13.460
We need to land in the city.

01:22:13.462 --> 01:22:16.463
<i>I am sorry, Larry.
My shift is ending.</i>

01:22:16.465 --> 01:22:18.599
<i>I'm gonna have to turn you over to Russ Peterson.</i>

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:20.734
- <i>Have a good one.</i>
- What? You can't do that.

01:22:20.736 --> 01:22:23.737
<i>Hey, Larry, Russ Peterson here.</i>

01:22:23.739 --> 01:22:26.707
Uh, okay, Russ, we're in a dire emergency.

01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:29.243
- We're gonna run out of fuel any second.
- <i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

01:22:29.245 --> 01:22:30.945
<i>Hold on, Larry, I just got here.</i>

01:22:30.947 --> 01:22:32.446
<i>Give me a chance to settle in.</i>

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:34.214
<i>Okay, I'm just...</i>

01:22:34.216 --> 01:22:35.916
<i>I'm taking my jacket off.</i>

01:22:35.918 --> 01:22:38.385
<i>Hey, is that a birthday cake?
Who's birthday is it?</i>

01:22:38.955 --> 01:22:43.824
<i>Happy birthday, big thug. Come
here, let me give you a hug.</i>

01:22:43.826 --> 01:22:46.327
<i>Okay, I'm just going to grab
myself a little cake here.</i>

01:22:57.172 --> 01:22:59.773
<i>Okay, I'm back.
Now, you were saying?</i>

01:22:59.775 --> 01:23:03.444
We're running out of fuel. I need
to land this plane in Los Angeles.

01:23:03.446 --> 01:23:06.647
- <i>Larry, that's never...</i>
- I know, it's never, but I'm doing it now.

01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:08.849
Son...

01:23:08.851 --> 01:23:11.352
If we don't make it, I just want you to know,

01:23:12.253 --> 01:23:14.355
- I love you.
- We might not make it?

01:23:14.357 --> 01:23:16.490
Of course we're going to make it.

01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:18.492
- Huh, yeah
- Yeah.

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:21.595
<i>Just how good are you?</i>

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:24.164
<i>Damn, he's good.</i>

01:23:25.567 --> 01:23:27.434
<i>You're a legend.</i>

01:23:27.436 --> 01:23:30.270
<i>Just follow your dreams and go wherever they take you.</i>

01:23:30.972 --> 01:23:33.340
<i>I have a private bunk</i>

01:23:33.342 --> 01:23:35.776
<i>with the only bathtub in this whole facility.</i>

01:23:35.778 --> 01:23:40.214
- <i>Larry? Do you read me?</i>
- Okay. Roger, Russ.

01:23:40.216 --> 01:23:42.716
This is Federated 37 heavy, coming in on

01:23:42.718 --> 01:23:47.321
uncleared course 45, vector
16, bearing two-niner-zero.

01:23:47.323 --> 01:23:48.455
Urban landing.

01:23:48.457 --> 01:23:50.858
I repeat, urban landing.

01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:52.593
<i>Roger that, Captain Gaye.</i>

01:23:52.595 --> 01:23:55.396
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your pilot speaking.

01:23:55.964 --> 01:23:57.731
Prepare for arrival.

01:23:57.733 --> 01:24:00.734
Oh, and if we survive, baggage
can be found on carousel 3.

01:24:23.324 --> 01:24:25.192
Uh, do I have space?

01:24:25.194 --> 01:24:27.127
Wait, wait, wait, after the minivan.

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:37.650
Uh, this guy's going to let us in.
Thank you.

01:24:49.484 --> 01:24:52.019
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:24:53.321 --> 01:24:55.522
Okay, okay, okay.

01:24:56.124 --> 01:24:57.691
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:03.530
<i>Wheels down. Repeat,
we have wheels on the ground.</i>

01:25:03.532 --> 01:25:05.666
Oh! Oh, thank God, Larry.

01:25:05.668 --> 01:25:07.909
<i>Completed an urban landing on a southbound freeway.</i>

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:16.310
Ah! You're one cool customer, Gaye.

01:25:16.312 --> 01:25:18.645
I would've peed in my pants.

01:25:18.647 --> 01:25:20.547
Ha! That's ridiculous.

01:25:20.549 --> 01:25:23.250
Larry! Larry! Larry!

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:28.722
Dad, I'm sorry I thought

01:25:28.724 --> 01:25:30.791
it was lame to be a flight attendant.

01:25:30.793 --> 01:25:34.528
That's okay, Son. Look, if it's one thing
that I teach you in this lifetime,

01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:36.530
it's that, well,

01:25:36.532 --> 01:25:40.334
it's that flight attendants pull
every bit as much ass as pilots.

01:25:41.436 --> 01:25:43.403
- Love you, Dad.
- Thanks, Son.

01:25:43.405 --> 01:25:44.805
Bring it here.

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:51.311
Okay, Lar, let's just get off at this exit,

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:53.147
and we can head back to the airport.

01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:54.681
Not yet.

01:25:54.683 --> 01:25:56.550
I got a stop to make first.

01:26:44.265 --> 01:26:47.067
Uh, yep. There it is.

01:27:17.432 --> 01:27:18.699
Donnie!

01:27:22.003 --> 01:27:23.470
Cross your arms.

01:27:37.152 --> 01:27:39.453
My goodness, Donnie!

01:27:39.455 --> 01:27:41.622
Donnie, I was worried sick!

01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:50.230
I'm sorry.
I just really missed Dad.

01:27:50.232 --> 01:27:53.500
Well, honey, you're gonna have
to learn how to deal with that.

01:27:53.502 --> 01:27:55.703
Daddy doesn't live here.
His home is in the sky.

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:57.671
Go get into bed, okay?

01:27:57.673 --> 01:27:59.273
Okay.

01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:04.578
Bye, Dad.

01:28:05.146 --> 01:28:06.480
Bye, Son.

01:28:08.983 --> 01:28:10.684
Thanks for bringing him home.

01:28:11.786 --> 01:28:13.387
Actually,

01:28:13.389 --> 01:28:15.789
I did a little thinking up there,

01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:19.092
while I was saving 200 people from a fiery death.

01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:21.428
Yeah?

01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:22.696
I thought about how,

01:28:23.998 --> 01:28:27.401
of all the great times I've had in my life,

01:28:27.403 --> 01:28:30.237
the greatest, the greatest,

01:28:31.339 --> 01:28:32.806
was the time I spent with you.

01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:36.877
Then why did you leave?

01:28:36.879 --> 01:28:39.112
Because I was an idiot,

01:28:39.114 --> 01:28:41.481
who thought that not being tied down

01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:43.884
and going from woman to woman

01:28:43.886 --> 01:28:45.919
to woman, to, in some cases,

01:28:45.921 --> 01:28:48.522
- women, plural.
- Go on.

01:28:48.524 --> 01:28:50.490
Would be a fun, fulfilling lifestyle,

01:28:50.492 --> 01:28:53.860
but the truth is, it was soulless and empty.

01:28:53.862 --> 01:28:57.264
All that meaningless sex was just filling a hole.

01:28:57.266 --> 01:28:58.899
And by hole, I don't mean vagina.

01:28:58.901 --> 01:29:00.967
Or in some cases, I guess I do mean vagina.

01:29:00.969 --> 01:29:02.135
I know what you mean.

01:29:02.137 --> 01:29:03.370
April...

01:29:04.639 --> 01:29:07.040
Is there any chance you could

01:29:07.042 --> 01:29:08.575
see your way clear to

01:29:08.577 --> 01:29:10.077
taking this idiot back?

01:29:10.678 --> 01:29:13.313
Oh, gosh, Larry.

01:29:13.315 --> 01:29:15.782
Did you really think you could
just waltz back into my life

01:29:15.784 --> 01:29:19.386
because you were finally ready and
I'd be sitting here waiting for you?

01:29:20.555 --> 01:29:22.155
Kind of, yeah.

01:29:27.095 --> 01:29:28.428
Oh, no.

01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:31.031
It's too late.

01:29:31.033 --> 01:29:32.733
You've moved on.

01:29:33.568 --> 01:29:34.868
You were the one thing in my life

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:36.236
that was real and true,

01:29:36.238 --> 01:29:37.571
and I blew it.

01:29:38.439 --> 01:29:40.073
Gah!

01:29:40.075 --> 01:29:42.376
How could I have thought you would've waited for me?

01:29:42.378 --> 01:29:44.544
Stupid Larry! Stupid Larry!

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:48.348
God, please,

01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:51.651
let me drown in this ocean of despair.

01:29:52.487 --> 01:29:54.221
Without this woman in my life,

01:29:54.989 --> 01:29:57.057
I don't want to live.

01:29:57.059 --> 01:29:58.925
I don't want to live!

01:29:58.927 --> 01:30:00.460
Murphy bed's all fixed.

01:30:00.462 --> 01:30:01.695
Thank you, Karl.

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:04.264
Oh.

01:30:05.833 --> 01:30:07.434
Larry...

01:30:07.436 --> 01:30:10.203
Listen, when you left and I
never heard from you again,

01:30:10.205 --> 01:30:12.139
that hurt me.

01:30:12.141 --> 01:30:16.643
But when you left Donnie, that
didn't just hurt me, that hurt him.

01:30:16.645 --> 01:30:19.413
I know, and I didn't want to leave.

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:22.916
But I didn't believe I could
be any better at fatherhood

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:24.885
than my own father was.

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:29.055
But then I landed that plane safely,

01:30:29.057 --> 01:30:32.092
and I realized that I can take care of my son.

01:30:32.094 --> 01:30:34.795
And being with him, and being with you,

01:30:36.397 --> 01:30:38.965
that'll keep me on the ground for good.

01:30:38.967 --> 01:30:40.887
So you'll really not fly anymore?

01:30:45.106 --> 01:30:46.206
Oh!

01:30:47.074 --> 01:30:49.142
Well, that is shockingly painful.

01:30:49.144 --> 01:30:51.411
Like, more than I would have ever imagined.

01:30:51.413 --> 01:30:53.780
Come here, Larry Elizabeth Gaye.

01:30:53.782 --> 01:30:56.850
I'm coming, April Elizabeth Fornicowsky.

01:30:56.852 --> 01:30:58.852
And by coming, I mean approaching, not ejaculating...

01:30:58.854 --> 01:31:00.353
I know what you mean.

01:31:04.859 --> 01:31:06.193
Aww!

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:17.337
Donnie! Donnie!

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:22.509
Daddy's staying.

01:31:22.511 --> 01:31:24.444
- Really?
- Yes, really.

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:31.785
It's okay, guys. You can go.

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:03.416
And so, I retired my apron,

01:32:03.418 --> 01:32:07.153
leaving the door open for someone else to finally win

01:32:07.155 --> 01:32:08.722
the Golden Coffee Pot.

01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:12.726
And because of the way the wiring
interfered with the plane's radios,

01:32:12.728 --> 01:32:17.531
Federated Airlines was forced to
abandon the Flightpal project.

01:32:17.533 --> 01:32:20.233
Three weeks after that fateful flight,

01:32:20.235 --> 01:32:23.236
I landed April, my beautiful bride

01:32:23.238 --> 01:32:24.838
and mother of my wonderful,

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:28.408
and no longer bastard, son Donnie.

01:32:28.410 --> 01:32:30.582
And the feeling of crushing empty loneliness

01:32:30.608 --> 01:32:32.512
that dogged me through the years, well,

01:32:32.514 --> 01:32:34.714
turned out to be a gluten allergy.

01:32:34.716 --> 01:32:36.349
Six months later, I found myself

01:32:36.351 --> 01:32:38.652
at a bookstore in downtown LA,

01:32:38.654 --> 01:32:41.988
reading this last chapter of my book.

01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:44.124
And then something unbelievable happened.

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:46.960
I looked up and saw...

01:32:54.368 --> 01:32:55.468
Dad?

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:02.008
Dad!

01:33:04.512 --> 01:33:05.845
It's me!

01:33:08.783 --> 01:33:10.617
- Larry.
- Larry. Larry.

01:33:12.554 --> 01:33:14.621
You look wonderful, Son.

01:33:16.324 --> 01:33:18.959
You too, Dad.

01:33:18.961 --> 01:33:22.829
You must have come to ask my forgiveness
for walking out all those years ago,

01:33:22.831 --> 01:33:25.231
and to beg me to allow you back into my life.

01:33:26.867 --> 01:33:30.503
That's exactly right, Larry, that's why I'm here.

01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:34.474
Well, there was a time...

01:33:34.476 --> 01:33:38.778
There was a time I would've told you to
stick several unwieldy objects in your ass.

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:42.782
A porcupine, a six iron

01:33:42.784 --> 01:33:44.718
a French horn,

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.286
ceramic pineapple.

01:33:47.355 --> 01:33:48.555
But...

01:33:49.957 --> 01:33:52.659
I've learned a little something about fatherhood.

01:33:56.497 --> 01:33:57.664
So...

01:33:58.866 --> 01:34:00.166
Whoo!

01:34:00.935 --> 01:34:02.402
I forgive you, Dad.

01:34:02.404 --> 01:34:03.804
- Oh...
- Welcome back into my life.

01:34:03.805 --> 01:34:05.205
Oh!

01:34:05.207 --> 01:34:08.308
Thank God.
Thank God!

01:34:08.909 --> 01:34:10.310
Oh, that is...

01:34:10.312 --> 01:34:12.979
- That is such a huge relief.
- Oh!

01:34:12.981 --> 01:34:14.247
I know.
- Boy, oh, boy.

01:34:14.249 --> 01:34:16.549
I know.

01:34:16.551 --> 01:34:18.618
- For me, too. For me, too.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:34:20.254 --> 01:34:21.521
Uh...

01:34:21.523 --> 01:34:23.723
You got to give me a second.
I got to move my car.

01:34:23.725 --> 01:34:25.825
- I'm double parked.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:34:27.062 --> 01:34:28.561
I'll be right back.

01:34:28.563 --> 01:34:29.763
- You got it, Dad.
- You got it.

01:34:29.765 --> 01:34:30.897
You got it.

01:34:30.899 --> 01:34:33.199
- You got it!

01:34:39.907 --> 01:34:41.041
Ah!

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:47.614
I can't wait to resume my relationship with that guy.

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:49.582
Oh!

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:52.185
Uh...

01:34:52.187 --> 01:34:54.888
Anyway, anyway...

01:34:56.257 --> 01:34:58.825
Then I closed the book

01:34:58.827 --> 01:35:00.493
to thunderous applause.

01:35:06.167 --> 01:35:08.935
Uh, it said "thunderous applause."

01:37:05.954 --> 01:37:07.687
- Four seems like plenty.
- Fine.
