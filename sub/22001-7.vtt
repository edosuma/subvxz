WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.321
FEMALE GPS VOICE: Take this exit
for Warwick, Rhode Island.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.223
SABRINA: Could you please
keep your eyes on the road?

00:22.256 --> 00:23.724
Relax. Got to look my best.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.593
This is my triumphant return.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.495
None of those jerks ever thought
I'd amount to anything.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.063
You haven't amounted
to anything.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.598
What are you talking about?
I got the big house,

00:30.631 --> 00:31.899
got the fancy cars...

00:31.932 --> 00:33.667
None of those things
belong to you.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.403
The point is, my life turned out
better than theirs,

00:35.436 --> 00:37.838
and today is all about shoving
that in their faces.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.574
-Alba, get off my dress.
-Isn't it Jimmy's day?

00:40.608 --> 00:41.775
He's the one
getting his number retired.

00:41.809 --> 00:44.011
How do you get
your number retired?

00:44.044 --> 00:46.046
By being a baseball legend.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.517
I was gonna go pro, but I took
a full ride to Stanford instead.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.952
Stanford University?

00:51.985 --> 00:53.687
Yeah, I wanted the degree.

00:53.721 --> 00:54.922
You know,
something to fall back on.

00:54.955 --> 00:57.158
So, what happened?

01:00.060 --> 01:02.196
Burned my ass off.

01:02.230 --> 01:03.597
How do you burn off your ass?

01:03.631 --> 01:05.032
What does that even mean?

01:05.065 --> 01:07.034
It was an accident, you know.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.903
We'd just won the division,
celebrated too hard,

01:09.937 --> 01:11.439
fell asleep
with a lit cigarette,

01:11.472 --> 01:13.874
and it must've caught my pants
on fire.

01:13.907 --> 01:17.111
My ass literally disintegrated.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.912
They couldn't
even find the hole.

01:18.946 --> 01:21.482
All right, that's... we don't
need to talk about the hole.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.284
Lost my full ride,
and next thing I know,

01:23.317 --> 01:24.718
I'm hanging out at the drains

01:24.752 --> 01:26.120
with the losers
and the burnouts.

01:26.154 --> 01:27.788
Hey. I was a drainer.

01:27.821 --> 01:30.591
We weren't losers.
We were just independent.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.961
Look, I'm lucky my ass was
the only thing I lost that day.

01:33.994 --> 01:36.397
If Mickey wasn't there to stomp
it out, I might be dead.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.299
Look, let's focus
on the positive, all right?

01:38.332 --> 01:39.900
This is your day.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.435
You're gonna be up there
on that stage.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.836
I'm gonna be right there
next to you.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.905
Why are you gonna be up there?

01:44.938 --> 01:46.640
Oh, I'm gonna be presenting him
with a big check.

01:46.674 --> 01:49.477
Gonna kick-start the Jimmy P.
Shepherd Scholarship Fund.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.978
With what? You have no money.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.746
None of those charity checks
are real.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.081
It's just, like, this big show
to make people feel good.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.483
How's my hair?

02:00.688 --> 02:02.490
What's this place? I thought we
were going to a baseball game.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.592
Nah, that's tonight.
This is Iguana's.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.460
It's where everybody hangs out.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.629
I'm not hanging out at a bar
called Iguana's all day.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.264
Come on, Chip,
let's go for a walk.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.200
No way. I'm not trying
to get murked.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.835
Chip, it's Rhode Island,
not Baghdad. We'll be fine.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.210
Hey, Jimmy Shepherd.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.478
I went to kindergarten
with that guy.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.247
All right, let's go.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.817
(billiard balls clack)

02:31.985 --> 02:33.721
Soak it in, losers.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.489
Mama's home.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.191
Huh?

02:37.225 --> 02:39.327
What's up?

02:39.360 --> 02:41.061
Ugh, what a dump.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.730
I don't like the look
of this place at all.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.198
Oh, relax, it's not dangerous.
It just sucks.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.633
You're too sheltered.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.900
You've got to get
out of Greenwich more.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.902
I just went
to Martha's Vineyard.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.003
Right.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.639
I got to go to the bathroom.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.407
Wait, are you, uh...

02:53.441 --> 02:55.643
-I'll come with.
-No.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.678
Sabrina, please don't leave me
out here alone.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.147
Chip, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.715
Fine.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.851
I hope you pee your uterus out.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.422
Yeah, oh, this is our backyard.
It's just so much space.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.190
-Sometimes we think
it's too big. -Yeah.

03:10.224 --> 03:12.092
Then we're like, "No, it's not.
What are you talking about?"

03:12.125 --> 03:14.061
Anyway,
th-th-there's so many rooms.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.529
This is probably getting boring.
What about you, Pete?

03:15.563 --> 03:17.365
How, uh, h-how's that
bus driving going, huh?

03:17.398 --> 03:21.101
You got any new exciting routes
you want to talk about? (laughs)

03:21.134 --> 03:22.703
Another round for us,
Shirley, okay?

03:22.736 --> 03:23.937
It's on me.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.172
Where's Ben?
I need his credit card.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.173
Yeah, I don't know.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.741
Oh, this is so cool.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.177
-I feel like I'm in high school.
(laughs) -Mm.

03:30.210 --> 03:33.281
Whoa. Who's that stud?

03:33.314 --> 03:35.549
-Oh, that's Mike O'Meara. -ALBA:
Well, who was he in high school?

03:35.583 --> 03:36.884
Was he prom king?

03:36.917 --> 03:39.086
No. He was a psychopath.

03:39.119 --> 03:41.188
He one time
ripped a man's ears off.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.624
He's cute. (giggles)

03:43.657 --> 03:45.893
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.362
MICKEY: Oh, you got to be
kidding me. Ipp Deluca's here?

03:48.396 --> 03:49.930
What? Who's Ipp Deluca?

03:49.963 --> 03:51.365
He's only like the biggest
scumbag in Warwick.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.367
Real piece of garbage.

03:53.401 --> 03:55.336
-Good friend of mine.
-Ah.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.640
What's wrong with you?

03:59.673 --> 04:01.208
I was mugged.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.543
I told you not
to leave me alone.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.578
I was gone for, like,
two minutes.

04:04.612 --> 04:05.946
These hoodlums,
they came out of nowhere.

04:05.979 --> 04:06.980
They were yelling,
they were screaming.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.215
They took my shoes.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.983
Well, why didn't you fight back?

04:10.017 --> 04:11.218
Are you out of your mind?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.653
They were animals.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.288
I wouldn't have stood a chance.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.223
Come on, let's just go wait
in the car.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.092
I'm not gonna go sit in a hot
car like some teen mom's baby.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.928
Sabrina, I was just attacked!

04:20.961 --> 04:22.930
I'm hungry.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.501
JIMMY:
A pitcher's ass

04:27.535 --> 04:31.171
is like a nuclear reactor,
it's the power center.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.674
Everything flows through it.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.909
I thought pitchers
used their arms?

04:35.943 --> 04:37.311
No, that's a common
misconception.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.747
All pitching comes
directly from the ass.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.749
(spits)

04:41.782 --> 04:44.251
What's that?

04:44.284 --> 04:46.320
I'm packing a lipper.
It's a baseball thing.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.255
I'm feeling a little nostalgic.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.691
You know I still hold
the strikeout record, right?

04:50.724 --> 04:52.125
That's awesome.

04:52.159 --> 04:54.695
-You must've had
a really nice butt. -Yeah.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.030
Looked like a Clydesdale.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.699
I can see her booby.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.668
JIMMY: I feel like
you're a bit too young

05:00.701 --> 05:03.437
for this game, but the damage
is already done.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.539
Let's see if we can get
this other nipple.

05:05.573 --> 05:08.208
Jimmy Shepherd.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.444
Oh, Ipp Deluca.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.846
-I thought you were in prison.
-I'm in and out.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.349
I heard your number's getting
retired. Congratulations.

05:15.383 --> 05:19.353
This guy is the best pitcher
I'd ever seen.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.221
Thanks, Ipp. That means a lot.

05:21.254 --> 05:22.890
Until my kid. He's way better.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.291
Is he?

05:24.324 --> 05:25.626
Yeah, Ipp Jr.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.294
You should see the ass
on this kid.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.129
It's the size of a jukebox.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.564
(smooches, says foreign word)

05:30.598 --> 05:32.299
That's where all the power
comes from.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.534
IPP:
That's right, kid.

05:33.567 --> 05:37.304
Sorry. Sensitive subject.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.306
-No, it's not.
-Yeah?

05:39.339 --> 05:41.909
-I've made peace with my past.
-Good, that's good.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.412
'Cause he's gonna shatter
your strikeout record, too.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.879
Yeah? Well, a lot can happen.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.014
It's a long season.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.315
How many does he need?

05:48.348 --> 05:49.583
One.

05:49.617 --> 05:52.520
I'm happy for him.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.522
MICKEY: Will you look
at this sack of garbage?

05:54.555 --> 05:57.090
Ipp Deluca!

05:57.124 --> 05:59.326
I thought you'd be dead by now.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.095
Honestly, I'm... genuinely
surprised you're still alive.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.598
Mickey Molng.
You two are still together?

06:04.632 --> 06:05.933
-Yeah.
-(groans)

06:05.966 --> 06:07.034
(scoffs) I mean...

06:07.067 --> 06:09.703
So you never told him...

06:09.737 --> 06:11.439
Wait. Do you need a beer?

06:11.472 --> 06:13.507
-Let's get you a new beer.
-No, I'm good. I got one.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.443
I know, but I don't like
to start a fresh conversation

06:15.476 --> 06:17.077
-without fresh beers in my hand.
-I'm fine.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.078
-Don't...
-No, it's fine.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.080
Come on, come on, let's go.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.582
IPP:
Huh.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.351
The hell are you doing?

06:24.384 --> 06:25.719
Keep your mouth shut.
We had a deal.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.788
I can't believe
he still doesn't know.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.389
Yeah, well, he doesn't
and he can't know now.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.791
Too much time has gone by.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.426
It'd be a whole thing.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.762
You look different, like a fancy
newscaster or something.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.930
It's because
I'm very well off now.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.365
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.767
Put truffles on everything.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.969
And, by the way, uh,
money did make me happy.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.237
It's a myth that it doesn't.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.740
-Hmm. Interesting.
-Mm-hmm.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.810
How about you pay me
to keep my mouth shut?

06:49.843 --> 06:51.912
-What?
-Seem like you could afford it.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.413
Well, obviously,
I can afford it.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.315
It's not about not being able
to afford it.

06:55.348 --> 06:58.285
Damn it.
How much are we talking?

06:58.318 --> 07:00.488
I don't know. $25,000?

07:00.521 --> 07:02.590
Shut your mouth.
Are you crazy?

07:02.623 --> 07:03.991
-Get out of here. I'm not
paying you a dime. -All right.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.292
-Get out of here.
-All right, all right.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.995
Then I am gonna tell Jimmy

07:08.028 --> 07:10.864
that you're the one
who burnt his ass.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.469
You got one hour to decide.

07:15.503 --> 07:16.904
What are you guys deciding?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.405
We're not deciding.
Why-why...?

07:18.438 --> 07:20.474
Stop eavesdropping on me
and my conversations.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.109
You got any quarters?

07:22.142 --> 07:24.444
Ben's a jack away
from uncovering the vagina.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.353
-It was this big
baseball party... -Uh-huh.

07:33.386 --> 07:34.655
Me and Ipp sneak off
to the bedroom.

07:34.688 --> 07:35.989
We wanted to do some whippets.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.290
Jimmy's already in there,
face down,

07:37.324 --> 07:38.659
blackout on the floor, right?

07:38.692 --> 07:40.160
He was such a good kid
back then.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.361
He never really drank.
His tolerance sucked.

07:41.394 --> 07:42.830
What a loser.

07:42.863 --> 07:43.964
Well, I see that,
and I'm like,

07:43.997 --> 07:45.365
"Okay, well, I got to light

07:45.398 --> 07:46.634
a bottle rocket out
of his ass now," right?

07:46.667 --> 07:48.435
-Yeah, yeah.
-But here's the thing,

07:48.468 --> 07:49.803
-it wouldn't launch.
-What?

07:49.837 --> 07:51.204
Oh, it just stood straight up,

07:51.238 --> 07:53.040
just sparking away
like a blowtorch.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.942
By the time he came to
in the hospital,

07:54.975 --> 07:56.376
I guess I panicked,
I don't know.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.545
That's when I came up
with that thing

07:57.578 --> 07:59.146
about the cigarette.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.181
Wow. That is some good

08:01.214 --> 08:04.184
-high school gossip, Mickey.
-That's not gossip.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.119
That is a terrible,
life-changing tragedy.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.454
Oh, no, it's-- it's a tragedy.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.789
But I'm not paying it.
I won't do it.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.123
I don't negotiate
with terrorists.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.124
Well, maybe you can tell him

08:11.158 --> 08:12.560
you really don't have any money.

08:12.593 --> 08:13.994
And look like an ass
in front of everybody?

08:14.027 --> 08:15.362
No, thank you.

08:15.395 --> 08:16.830
No, we just got
to get rid of him.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.131
Well, how you gonna do that?

08:18.165 --> 08:20.200
I'm not.
Mike O'Meara is.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.070
Only thing Mike loves
more than fighting

08:23.103 --> 08:24.572
is his car.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.173
We're gonna make him think
Ipp destroyed it.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.676
That car is so hot.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.178
I bet Mike O'Meara hooks up
a ton in there.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.714
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.651
I don't know, it's kind of
charming here, right?

08:37.685 --> 08:40.487
Ugh. What did I just step in?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.255
-Oh, that's a bird.
-Ugh.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.257
Yeah, you just stepped
on a dead bird, dude.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.525
Why is it so squishy?

08:45.559 --> 08:47.928
I think it's been there
for a while.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.730
Oh, God, there they are,
there they are.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.431
-Are you kidding me?
-(bicycle bell rings)

08:51.464 --> 08:53.567
Those are the hoodlums
that attacked you?

08:53.601 --> 08:55.202
-They're little kids.
-Shh, shh!

08:55.235 --> 08:57.738
God, you are such a wang.
Come on.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.307
Hey, stop right there!

09:01.308 --> 09:02.275
What's up, sweetheart?

09:02.309 --> 09:03.276
Want to be my date tonight?

09:03.310 --> 09:05.112
What? No.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.947
Just give my brother
his shoes back, okay?

09:06.980 --> 09:09.617
What shoes?
These shoes?

09:09.650 --> 09:11.018
Yes. Hand them over.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.753
Show us your boobs first.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.254
Excuse me?

09:14.287 --> 09:15.723
Let's see them apples,
sweetheart.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.057
Do it. Do it.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.759
Yeah, that's not happening.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.260
But we could all die tomorrow.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.595
Come on, take 'em out.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.363
Make a boy dreams come true.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.465
Not a chance, you little creep.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.267
Then you're not getting
your stuff back.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.069
I wouldn't walk
around here barefoot.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.638
There's a lot of dead birds.

09:30.671 --> 09:33.406
Okay, fine, one boob
for one second.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.642
Sabrina, what the hell?

09:34.675 --> 09:37.077
Do you want your stuff back
or not?

09:37.110 --> 09:38.478
-Wha...
-(screams)

09:38.511 --> 09:40.247
-Wait a second. Hold on.
-(kids laughing)

09:40.280 --> 09:42.149
(bicycle bell rings)

09:42.182 --> 09:44.184
-(music playing)
-(indistinct chatter)

09:48.455 --> 09:50.557
Okay, okay.
So, I told Mike

09:50.590 --> 09:52.425
that Ipp was messing
with his car,

09:52.459 --> 09:55.228
and then I started flirting
with him super hard.

09:55.262 --> 09:58.265
Nice. Good.
Stick to one agenda.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.769
Watch this shot, you morons.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.676
-(alarmed shouts)
-Ooh, that escalated quickly.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.111
(grunts, groans)

10:11.144 --> 10:13.513
For the record, I was not
anticipating this much violence,

10:13.546 --> 10:16.684
-but, uh, okay, problem solved.
-ALBA: Yeah.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.018
(shouts)

10:18.051 --> 10:19.519
MICKEY:
Whoa! He's up.

10:19.552 --> 10:20.788
He's up.
He's back in action.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.956
Oh, no, no, no.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.057
Oh, mi amor!

10:25.392 --> 10:26.626
(groans)
That's not good.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.128
(crowd gasps)

10:28.161 --> 10:31.131
Should I continue beating
this man?

10:31.164 --> 10:33.801
All signs point to yes.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.703
(crowd gasps)

10:35.736 --> 10:39.506
Will this mutt ever
eat solid foods again?

10:39.539 --> 10:43.010
Outlook not so good.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.577
Mm. Okay.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.782
What the hell's the matter
with you, O'Meara?

10:48.816 --> 10:51.651
(groans)
You smashed up my car.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.353
I didn't touch your car.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.122
She saw you.

10:55.155 --> 10:59.392
Yup. Th-That's right.
I-I did.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.961
Who the hell are you?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.696
I'm Alba.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.732
Oh, you know, she's with me,
Ipp. Okay?

11:04.765 --> 11:06.566
-So now I'm directly involved.
-Aw, f...

11:06.599 --> 11:07.901
Okay. This is a train wreck.

11:07.935 --> 11:10.303
You trying to silence me?

11:10.337 --> 11:13.974
You don't silence me.
I'm Ipp Deluca!

11:14.007 --> 11:15.709
I don't know what you're
talking about,

11:15.743 --> 11:17.711
but I don't hang out
in places like this anymore.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.347
I hang out in fancy
establishments, all right?

11:20.380 --> 11:21.982
-Go get Ben, and let's get out
of here. -Stop-- no, stop...

11:22.015 --> 11:23.683
I want my $25,000.

11:23.717 --> 11:27.054
What are you guys talking about?

11:27.087 --> 11:28.722
You want to tell him, Mick,
or should I?

11:28.756 --> 11:30.557
Tell me what?

11:32.025 --> 11:36.663
Jimmy, you didn't
burn your ass off.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.098
Mickey did.

11:40.567 --> 11:43.170
Wasn't a cigarette,
it was a bottle rocket.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.372
She put it between your cheeks.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.274
She thought it'd be funny,
and it was.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.776
-Mick, tell me the truth.
-No, no.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.077
Because it-it's compli--

11:50.110 --> 11:51.344
-it's very complicated.
-No, it's not.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.712
-It's a yes-or-no question.
-No.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.447
-Did you do that?
-No, there's-- there are

11:54.481 --> 11:57.617
so many layers and-and
in-interesting...

11:57.650 --> 12:01.088
Okay, just stop messing with my
head and just tell me the truth.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.992
Did you burn my ass off?

12:06.593 --> 12:08.996
Jimmy...

12:13.834 --> 12:18.271
No. Of course I didn't.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.908
No. (laughs)
Come on.

12:20.941 --> 12:24.011
What about your nuts?

12:26.914 --> 12:28.648
If you dropped a cigarette down
your pants, the fire would've

12:28.681 --> 12:30.250
started in your front.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.219
How come you didn't burn
your nuts?

12:32.252 --> 12:34.454
Eh... (scoffs)

12:34.487 --> 12:35.722
Why didn't I burn my nuts?

12:35.755 --> 12:37.825
(stammers)
What are you, CSI?

12:37.858 --> 12:40.227
I mean... y-y-you're, like,
a fire investigator

12:40.260 --> 12:41.228
all of a sudden?
(laughs)

12:41.261 --> 12:42.896
She just had me attacked.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.932
Dude, what more do you need
to know?

12:52.772 --> 12:55.042
Jimmy!

12:56.509 --> 12:58.812
Shh, shh, shh.
That's okay, papito.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.848
Alba's gonna take care of you.
Yeah. (kisses)

13:05.452 --> 13:07.020
Hey, hey there. Mickey Molng,
hometown hero. Hi.

13:07.054 --> 13:08.255
Hey-hey, guys. What's up?

13:08.288 --> 13:09.756
I'm back. I know.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.692
Cool. Come on, Jimmy,
where are you?

13:12.725 --> 13:14.794
Where is everybody? Why is it
just you and me here?

13:14.828 --> 13:17.664
Alba went home
with the monster man.

13:17.697 --> 13:18.966
New outfit?

13:18.999 --> 13:20.633
Get the hell away from me.

13:20.667 --> 13:23.270
That's my boy Ipp Jr.
warming up.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.472
That ass is gonna make me rich.

13:25.505 --> 13:26.940
For the record, I could've
easily afforded

13:26.974 --> 13:28.375
to pay you off, okay?

13:28.408 --> 13:30.110
It was a matter of principle.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.212
I'm about to present a check
for $1 million,

13:32.245 --> 13:33.947
so it's clearly not
about the money.

13:33.981 --> 13:36.049
$1 million? Eh.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.051
What do you mean, "eh"?

13:38.085 --> 13:39.152
That'll put, like, three kids
through college,

13:39.186 --> 13:40.453
if they go to a state school.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.554
Get the hell out of here.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.891
-(sighs)
-What if Jimmy doesn't come?

13:43.924 --> 13:46.526
He'll come, buddy-- I got a
pretty good idea of where he is.

13:46.559 --> 13:49.229
Here, hold this.
I'll be back.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.164
Move.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.700
That's right, Junior.
Put your ass into it!

14:00.040 --> 14:02.042
CHIP (panting):
No.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.710
-Chip...
-No, Sabrina, I don't like this.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.879
Let's just cut our losses
and get out of here.

14:05.913 --> 14:08.681
Look, I got to tell you
something, as your sister, okay?

14:08.715 --> 14:11.751
You're a coward, dude.
It is so pathetic.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.186
Now, if you'll excuse me,

14:13.220 --> 14:15.355
I got to go get this picture
of my boob.

14:17.790 --> 14:20.560
(sighs)
Give me that phone.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.695
-I said give me that phone!
-(screaming)

14:22.729 --> 14:23.897
You're crazy! Ow!

14:23.931 --> 14:26.799
Hey. The hell is going on?

14:27.867 --> 14:29.869
Your kids are jerks, okay?

14:29.903 --> 14:30.938
That's what's going on.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.206
Is everything okay, babe?

14:33.240 --> 14:35.775
Oh, hey, Sabrina. Mmm.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.810
(Alba giggles)

14:40.880 --> 14:42.282
(door opens)

14:47.454 --> 14:50.357
There he is.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.925
Uh...

14:51.959 --> 14:53.526
The ceremony's about to start.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.128
-(spits)
-Ugh.

14:55.162 --> 14:56.229
(sighs)

14:56.263 --> 14:57.764
Look, I know you're upset,

14:57.797 --> 15:00.900
but it would be a real shame
to ruin the night.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.937
Ruin the night?

15:03.971 --> 15:05.939
You ruined my life.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.907
Jimmy, it was an accident.
All right?

15:07.941 --> 15:09.576
It was a terrible accident.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.545
One that, for the record,
wasn't entirely my fault,

15:12.579 --> 15:14.881
just because it was--
t-the rocket malfunctioned.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.716
-If I had known that...
-Forget the rocket.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.052
-Okay? You lied to me.
-Yeah. Yeah.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.587
Should I have told you
the truth?

15:20.620 --> 15:22.389
Eh...

15:22.422 --> 15:24.091
Eh, maybe.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.625
I-I don't know that that would
have made it better.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.794
Would it have brought
your ass back? No.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.462
The point is,
you make mistakes in life,

15:29.496 --> 15:30.998
and then you got to move on.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.432
You do stupid stuff.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.501
Y-You burn out the ass
of your boyfriend,

15:34.534 --> 15:36.970
and then, y-you harbor that
as a secret for 20 years,

15:37.004 --> 15:38.438
but you move on.

15:38.471 --> 15:39.839
That is life, Jimmy.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.274
Okay? And tonight
is really important,

15:41.308 --> 15:42.942
and I would hate for you
to let all of that--

15:42.976 --> 15:45.178
that just doesn't
even matter anymore--

15:45.212 --> 15:47.214
ruin this night for you.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.618
-Mm.
-All right.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.854
I'll do it for you, Mickey.

15:54.887 --> 15:57.124
-Yeah?
-Yeah. I'll go.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.126
Peace and closure.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.827
Not the past.

16:00.860 --> 16:04.931
'Cause we're champions now,
in this time.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.966
Right.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.738
-Let's go.
-Let's do it.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.375
Thanks for showing us
your knockers.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.844
Yeah, they're real nice.

16:17.877 --> 16:20.380
I'm gonna get out of here. Alba.
Are you coming with me, or,

16:20.413 --> 16:22.349
like, what are you doing?

16:22.382 --> 16:23.950
(knocking on door)

16:23.983 --> 16:25.685
(indistinct radio chatter)

16:25.718 --> 16:28.088
I'm looking for two suspects
in a robbery/assault.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.158
That's them, Officer.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.725
SABRINA:
Seriously, Chip?

16:32.759 --> 16:33.726
What did you do?

16:33.760 --> 16:34.894
Called the police.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.729
Not so cowardly anymore, am I?

16:36.763 --> 16:37.997
Are you kidding me?
That's incredibly cowardly.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.866
God, you're such a weenie.

16:39.899 --> 16:42.135
Whatever. I don't care
if I'm a coward. I'm rich.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.637
Bravery's for poor people,
like soldiers and policemen.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.639
Officer, arrest these hoodlums.

16:46.673 --> 16:47.840
But we erased the picture.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.376
Yeah, we're really sorry.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.643
I got a machine gun
in my bedroom.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.212
-Full disclosure.
-Mm. Yeah.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.746
Okay. Officer, I'm sorry.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.082
There's been a misunderstanding.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.983
My brother
just overreacted, okay?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.318
So you don't
want to press charges?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.287
No.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.657
(siren chirps)

17:04.691 --> 17:05.992
CHIP:
Yeah!

17:06.025 --> 17:07.227
Don't mess with Greenwich, baby.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.361
Let's go!

17:08.395 --> 17:10.663
Ha, ha! Have fun in jail!

17:10.697 --> 17:13.466
You're a terrible person.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.869
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:16.903 --> 17:18.938
North Warwick High School great,

17:18.971 --> 17:21.108
number 69,

17:21.141 --> 17:22.642
-Jimmy Shepherd.
-(cheering, applause)

17:24.244 --> 17:26.913
-Thanks, Coach.
-You betcha, Jimmy.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.351
-(microphone feedback) -Hey,
thanks for having me, everybody.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.019
It's a real honor to be here.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.623
I just want to take an
opportunity to say that, uh...

17:36.656 --> 17:38.725
this ceremony's a farce!

17:38.758 --> 17:40.560
-Okay.
-'Cause I'm not a pitcher!

17:40.593 --> 17:42.262
-All right.
-Okay? I'm not. I'm really not.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.030
-Okay. That's enough.
-I'm an ass-less fool,

17:44.063 --> 17:45.865
and this is the woman
who lit the match!

17:45.898 --> 17:47.567
-No, you get-- this is mine!
-Hey, Jimmy.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.735
-Stop it!
-That's enough.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.403
-This is my moment!
-Let go.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.305
Let go, let go.

17:52.339 --> 17:53.940
Thank you.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.208
-Jimmy Shep...
-(microphone feedback)

17:55.242 --> 17:56.576
Jimmy Shepherd, everybody.

17:56.609 --> 17:57.777
-L-Let's tip our cap.
-(scattered applause)

17:57.810 --> 17:58.911
(chuckles)
Wonderful.

17:58.945 --> 18:01.714
(crowd gasping)

18:01.748 --> 18:05.452
It's been a, uh,
an emotional day for-for Jimmy,

18:05.485 --> 18:07.554
-as-as...
-Going home!

18:07.587 --> 18:09.322
-Very understandable.
-Out!

18:09.356 --> 18:10.757
MICKEY: All right,
having a real meltdown...

18:10.790 --> 18:12.259
Hey, what'd we miss?

18:12.292 --> 18:13.960
It's kind of hard to explain.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.395
MICKEY:
What makes a man?

18:15.428 --> 18:16.996
Is it his arm or his ass
or is it really

18:17.029 --> 18:18.898
what's inside that matters?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.099
Am I right?

18:20.133 --> 18:21.568
Anyway, um, I have
this giant check

18:21.601 --> 18:23.403
for an absurd amount of money,

18:23.436 --> 18:26.139
and since it wouldn't really
make a dent in my life anymore,

18:26.173 --> 18:28.908
I-I figured I should give it
to the less fortunate.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.843
Where the hell
did you get fireworks?

18:30.877 --> 18:32.479
-What are you doing? -I'm giving
the people what they want.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.080
-This is not-- nobody
wants this. -Yeah, they do.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.815
-Jimmy, nobody wants this.
-Get your hands off me.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.617
-Jimmy, what are you doing?
-You let me have this!

18:37.650 --> 18:39.652
MICKEY: Give it to me.
You're making a scene!

18:39.686 --> 18:40.920
-I need closure.
-Stop it.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.121
-This isn't closure.
-Oh, yeah, it is.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.591
-Knock it off.
-Why didn't I burn my nuts?

18:44.624 --> 18:45.992
-Stop it. Stop.
-(screams)

18:46.025 --> 18:47.694
COACH:
Settle down now, Jimmy.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.262
Uh, you've been here
before, buddy.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.930
-Come on!
-Get away from me. Get away.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.599
-MICKEY: Hold still.
-It's what they want.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.167
Nobody wants to see this.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.836
-Are you not entertained?!
-Let go of me.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.438
(shouts)

18:58.471 --> 19:00.006
-Oh, my God! -No!
-(crowd gasping)

19:00.039 --> 19:01.441
My golden egg!

19:01.474 --> 19:03.109
My beautiful boy!

19:03.142 --> 19:05.312
No! Junior!

19:05.345 --> 19:06.979
Shake it off, son!

19:07.013 --> 19:08.781
Oh, God, Jimmy!
What have you done?!

19:08.815 --> 19:10.183
You son of a bitch!

19:10.217 --> 19:11.284
My baby boy!

19:11.318 --> 19:14.053
(crying):
No!

19:14.086 --> 19:15.888
Oh, Junior, no!

19:15.922 --> 19:17.357
No, boy, no!

19:17.390 --> 19:20.159
What have you done?
You bastard!

19:20.193 --> 19:22.529
No, no!

19:22.562 --> 19:23.730
No!

19:23.763 --> 19:25.732
Thank you, and congratulations.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.167
It's been a lovely ceremony.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.407
Jimmy, get in the car.

19:34.441 --> 19:35.742
No. I'm walking home.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.009
Hey, you saved
your strikeout record.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.211
Are you kidding me?

19:38.245 --> 19:41.147
Another ballplayer
cut down in his prime?

19:41.180 --> 19:43.216
All 'cause of me
and my stupid ass.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.051
-Mickey.
-Not now. Okay?

19:45.084 --> 19:46.586
-Mickey.
-What?

19:46.619 --> 19:48.154
I made out with Mike O'Meara.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.590
This is his gum.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.392
-All right.
-(tires screech) -Oh.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.626
That's it.

19:55.127 --> 19:56.929
Hey.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.598
I said it was an accident, okay?

19:58.631 --> 20:00.867
What else do you want from me?

20:00.900 --> 20:03.236
How about, "I'm sorry"?

20:03.270 --> 20:04.604
That's it?

20:04.637 --> 20:05.772
"I'm sorry"?

20:05.805 --> 20:07.039
Yeah.

20:07.073 --> 20:09.876
Yeah, of course.
I-I'll apologize.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.411
I just want
to point out, though,

20:11.444 --> 20:14.447
you know, one more time, that it
wasn't entirely my fault.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.548
The rocket was defective, okay?
(stammers)

20:15.582 --> 20:17.083
I'm just, I'm just saying,

20:17.116 --> 20:18.785
that you just shot one very
successfully out of your ass,

20:18.818 --> 20:20.720
and there was-- I see now,
that's not the point, that's

20:20.753 --> 20:23.055
not the point, that's not what
you want. I get it, I get it.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.091
I get it. I'm so...

20:26.393 --> 20:28.261
S-- I'm s...

20:28.295 --> 20:31.097
(stammers, hisses)
I can-- I'm so...

20:31.130 --> 20:33.065
I... wha-- I, it wasn't my...

20:33.099 --> 20:34.200
No.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.103
I'm s... I made a mis...

20:37.136 --> 20:39.472
God, it's get--
it's, uh, gets stuck.

20:39.506 --> 20:40.707
It just gets stuck.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.575
Look.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.979
I'm sorry.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.482
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
that I burnt off your ass.

20:49.516 --> 20:52.885
I'm really sorry. Okay?

20:52.919 --> 20:54.554
I don't accept your apology.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.756
(laughing):
Oh, you son of a bitch.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.426
You dirty son of a bitch.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.927
-It's too late.
-What?

21:00.960 --> 21:02.228
I know you have nice clothes,

21:02.261 --> 21:04.597
nice car, but you're not nice.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.467
Thanks for coming
to Warwick, guys.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.135
I hope you had fun.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.040
Please leave the door unlocked.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.681
You know, we were
going to have sex,

21:21.714 --> 21:23.249
but Mike didn't have a condom.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.852
I was so pissed.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.657
-Put your seatbelt on.
-(engine starts)

kickin' it
