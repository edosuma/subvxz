just take the critique.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.557
No, I do not.

10:47.393 --> 10:49.298

I didn't instigate it

Black Lives Matter.</i>

10:51.101 --> 10:52.571

I'm gonna be flat out
honest and say that Binta

scares the ( bleep )
out of me.

10:56.078 --> 10:57.314
We do not know who we are.

10:57.314 --> 10:59.619
That's why we're
African American.

10:59.619 --> 11:02.825
- If you know
who you are as African...
- You guys, you're from Africa.

11:02.825 --> 11:06.365
We were trying to explain
to her that we are Americans,

11:06.365 --> 11:08.737
<i>like that we don't
identify with Africans</i>

11:08.737 --> 11:09.639

black Americans.

I'm an American.

11:11.275 --> 11:13.412
I'm sorry,
I'm an American.
My people built it.

11:13.412 --> 11:14.949
- We have been here for so long.
- Let me tell you something.

11:14.949 --> 11:16.151
So where does
your people come from?

11:16.151 --> 11:17.353
They didn't come

11:17.353 --> 11:18.991
Where did your people
come from?

11:18.991 --> 11:21.028
We don't talk African.
We not Nigerians.

11:21.028 --> 11:22.599
Nigerians know where
they come from.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.100
We're the only people
that don't know where

11:24.100 --> 11:26.172
we come from.

11:26.172 --> 11:28.375
I'm telling you,
y'all livin' in
a la la land.

11:28.375 --> 11:31.315
Marissa:
Binta can definitely
be a very strong personality

11:31.315 --> 11:34.187
<i>and that is something that
will definitely annoy me.</i>

11:34.187 --> 11:36.191
Seriously,
with so many girls
we're all here

11:36.191 --> 11:39.365
because our
strong personality
got us here.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.368
<i>All I know
is this a competition.</i>

11:41.368 --> 11:43.305
<i>So let the games begin.</i>

11:44.809 --> 11:46.613
- Ladies.
- Yes.

11:46.613 --> 11:49.852
Ladies.
Winning squad.
I'm here.

11:49.852 --> 11:52.357
Before I take you outside
I wanna talk to everyone.

11:52.357 --> 11:54.328
Giah:
When Stacey McKenzie
came to the house

11:54.328 --> 11:56.900
<i>I feel like the house
is a little bit divided.</i>

11:56.900 --> 11:58.035
<i>The energy
feels off,</i>

11:58.035 --> 12:01.175
but this is a once
in a lifetime opportunity

12:01.175 --> 12:03.547
and I cannot let anything
or any of the girls,

12:03.547 --> 12:06.085
anybody get in my way.

12:06.085 --> 12:08.389
I know that you guys
are working on three B's

12:08.389 --> 12:09.826
- right now, eh?
- All: Yes.

12:09.826 --> 12:10.894
What are they?

12:10.894 --> 12:13.399
All:
Boss, business and brand.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.038
Yeah, but with
that being said
I'll add another B.

12:16.038 --> 12:17.908
The other B
is believing
in yourself.

12:17.908 --> 12:19.311
Without believing
in yourself

12:19.311 --> 12:21.381
it's gonna be
a little difficult.

12:21.381 --> 12:23.386
So I'm gonna tell you
what it took me to get
to where I'm at today.

12:23.386 --> 12:25.558
I've always wanted to
model from when I was around six
years old.

12:25.558 --> 12:28.731
I saw a picture actually
of Jean-Paul Gaultier
and Madonna,

12:28.731 --> 12:31.602
<i>and my sister told me
she was gonna be modeling
for Jean-Paul Gaultier.</i>

12:31.602 --> 12:33.707
So, I'm like,
"Oh, really, modeling
as a career?"

12:33.707 --> 12:36.580
From then on,
I just lived, eat,
breath, sleep it.

12:36.580 --> 12:38.851
I had an opportunity
to move to Toronto, Canada.

12:38.851 --> 12:40.921
Um, I was able
to go and see agencies.

12:40.921 --> 12:42.625
They all were like, "No."

12:42.625 --> 12:44.528
Some would say to me,
"You're different looking."

12:44.528 --> 12:46.566
You know, like, no
this is not the business
for you.

12:46.566 --> 12:49.337
Then I tried
another country.
I went to New York.

12:49.337 --> 12:50.741
It was the same thing
all over again but even worse.

12:50.741 --> 12:53.412
It was like,
"Hell no. What?"

12:53.412 --> 12:55.518
My journey took me
all the way to Paris.

12:55.518 --> 12:57.087
I finally got an agency.

12:57.087 --> 13:00.092
When I did get
that agency...

13:00.092 --> 13:01.896
the owner
of the agency
wasn't there.

13:01.896 --> 13:04.201
When he came back
from his vacation,

13:04.201 --> 13:05.971
we were all invited
out to, um, a model dinner.

13:05.971 --> 13:09.244
I sat at his table,
I couldn't afford to have,
like, designer clothing.

13:09.244 --> 13:11.884
I was wearing a dress
that cost me a dollar...

13:11.884 --> 13:13.485
and a pair of shoes...

13:17.393 --> 13:18.797
a pair...

13:18.797 --> 13:21.736
a pair of shoes
that cost me a dollar.

13:21.736 --> 13:23.238
And this man came and...

13:23.238 --> 13:24.943
and he sat there
at that table

13:24.943 --> 13:26.613
in front of all
those other girls.

13:26.613 --> 13:28.416
And he put me down
so bad.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.319
He was like,
"Why did you guys
take this girl?

13:30.319 --> 13:31.321
She's hideous."

13:31.321 --> 13:33.225
It was the most
hurtful thing,

13:33.225 --> 13:35.230
but I never showed
that I was hurt.

13:35.230 --> 13:38.302
Because for some reason
I always had this feeling
within here,

13:38.302 --> 13:40.340
like, I belong
in this business.

13:40.340 --> 13:43.145
Krislian:
Stacey's story today,
it really resonated with me.

13:43.145 --> 13:45.985
Every agency automatically
turns me down because I'm short.

13:45.985 --> 13:47.688
You know, they're like,
"You're too sexy.

13:47.688 --> 13:49.157
You're too commercial."

13:49.157 --> 13:50.493
<i>You know,
it gets discouraging.</i>

13:50.493 --> 13:52.631
Stacey:
I finally got to this
one agency.

13:52.631 --> 13:55.102
By the time I got there
I already made up my mind.

13:55.102 --> 13:58.008
If they say no,
that means this business
is not for me.

13:58.008 --> 13:59.845
The agent looks at me
and he says,

13:59.845 --> 14:01.749
"What are you doing here?"

14:01.749 --> 14:03.086
I'm like,
"What do you think, dude?"

14:03.086 --> 14:05.123
- ( girls laugh )
- "What do you think?"

14:05.123 --> 14:06.459
I'm like,
"I'm here to be
a model."

14:06.459 --> 14:08.329
He goes,
"Okay, you know what?
Go to this appointment

14:08.329 --> 14:10.668
make sure you're
at this casting tomorrow.
Do no be late."

14:10.668 --> 14:11.970
I'm like,
"Are you serious?"

14:11.970 --> 14:14.174
The appointment
was for Jean-Paul Gaultier.

14:16.311 --> 14:17.848
So my first show
that I booked

14:17.848 --> 14:19.317
was for
Jean-Paul Gaultier.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.188
<i>The man that I saw
in the picture</i>

14:21.188 --> 14:24.027
<i>that propelled me
to get into fashion.</i>

14:24.027 --> 14:27.535
Yeah, and when
I got to that show
and I got backstage

14:27.535 --> 14:30.106
there was a lady
sitting there getting her
hair and makeup done

14:30.106 --> 14:32.444
and she's like,
"Oh, can I have them legs?"

14:32.444 --> 14:34.982
And I look at her,
I'm like, "Madonna?"

14:34.982 --> 14:38.022
( all screaming )

14:38.022 --> 14:41.061
Madonna was in the same
exact show I was walking in.

14:41.061 --> 14:44.034
<i>Jean-Paul Gaultier,
Madonna.</i>

14:44.034 --> 14:46.038
You guys
have the opportunity
of a lifetime.

14:46.038 --> 14:49.845
I wish I had
what you guys
have right now.

14:49.845 --> 14:52.016
Believe in yourself.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.553
All right?
Thank you.

14:53.553 --> 14:55.657
That's my story.

14:55.657 --> 14:58.062
Tash:
<i>Stacey was just
an inspiration.</i>

14:58.062 --> 14:59.732
<i>Literally earlier
in the day</i>

14:59.732 --> 15:03.172
<i>it was a lot of
snappiness and cattiness,</i>

15:03.172 --> 15:06.045
but after getting
the pep talk from Stacey

15:06.045 --> 15:09.150
that just really changes
my whole perspective.

15:09.150 --> 15:12.157
Winning squad,
come with me downstairs.
Let's get to work.

15:12.157 --> 15:16.065
Giah:
We won the runway battle
and, Stacey,

15:16.065 --> 15:18.235
she's gonna give us
runway practice,

15:18.235 --> 15:19.739
like, in our
little back patio.

15:19.739 --> 15:21.074
All right,
so what I want you to do

15:21.074 --> 15:23.078
is each of you
one at a time walk for me.

15:23.078 --> 15:25.851
Binta:
I'm definitely
better than Paige.

15:29.458 --> 15:31.394
Great turn, wow,
whoa, very good turn.

15:31.394 --> 15:34.936
Paige:
Binta is definitely a huge
competition for me

15:34.936 --> 15:38.041
but, runway is what
I kick ass at.

15:39.679 --> 15:42.083
Stacey:
When you're walking
you're taking a horse step.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.254
Don't bend your knees too much
and lift too much.

15:44.254 --> 15:46.091
Squint your eyes a little bit,
yeah, like that.

15:46.091 --> 15:48.897
I'm trying to get
some pointers, too.

15:51.135 --> 15:53.138
All of squad two
was, like,

15:53.138 --> 15:55.276
trying to peak out
the window.

15:55.276 --> 15:57.581
<i>Stacey is a huge
runway walker,</i>

15:57.581 --> 15:59.953
of course, they're gonna have,
like, a huge advantage over us.

15:59.953 --> 16:01.388
One thing I like
about you, Kyle,

16:01.388 --> 16:02.792
I don't want you
to lose that.

16:02.792 --> 16:04.394
I like the edginess
that you got going on.

16:04.394 --> 16:06.900
Kyle:
And you watch people
walk on a runway

16:06.900 --> 16:08.603
you think it
just looks so simple.

16:08.603 --> 16:10.206
Shoulders back.

16:10.206 --> 16:11.610
- You look stiff. - Kyle: <i>But
that's the trick</i>

16:11.610 --> 16:13.780
is that they
are making it
look perfect.

16:13.780 --> 16:16.251
Relax,
shoulders back.

16:16.251 --> 16:17.788
Kyle, she was
really stiff,

16:17.788 --> 16:20.293
and she didn't have
the confidence.

16:20.293 --> 16:22.097
<i>I think
she was just trying
to figure out</i>

16:22.097 --> 16:23.432
the balance between

16:23.432 --> 16:25.336
being a bottle
and still being herself.

16:26.639 --> 16:27.908
Yeah, work on it,
practice.

16:27.908 --> 16:29.244
So tomorrow's
the big show.

16:29.244 --> 16:30.947
Make sure
you rule the runway

16:30.947 --> 16:32.484
with a lot of confidence.

16:32.484 --> 16:36.325
Kill it, slay it,
murder it, torture it.

16:36.325 --> 16:38.997
All right,
ladies, practice.

16:38.997 --> 16:40.333
Practice,
practice, practice.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.769
She's a singer,
she's a dancer.

16:41.769 --> 16:44.240
And the best part about it
is that she's here.

16:45.777 --> 16:47.615
Oh, my God.

16:47.615 --> 16:50.419

things out

18:14.254 --> 18:16.425
and not putting it back
where it belongs.

wanna impress him.

<i>And it's a beautiful
thing when you have someone</i>

19:24.160 --> 19:25.496
<i>that really understands
the beauty of fashion</i>

19:25.496 --> 19:27.300
which is
to just be bold.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.639
- To do you.
- Paige: <i>Aww, Zendaya.</i>

19:29.639 --> 19:31.241
I'm completely
on cloud nine.

19:31.241 --> 19:32.912
This is a celebrity
I've loved for years.

19:32.912 --> 19:34.915
She's definitely
the ultimate lady boss.

19:34.915 --> 19:36.986
I aspire to be
just as boss

19:36.986 --> 19:38.523
like as she is
and then some.

19:38.523 --> 19:41.328
And whoever Zendaya
thinks embodies being
a boss the best

19:41.328 --> 19:44.502
is gonna get
to take a picture
with the lovely Zendaya

19:44.502 --> 19:46.171
that she'll post
on social media,

19:46.171 --> 19:47.808
and you're gonna decide
who's gonna win

19:47.808 --> 19:49.645
- this challenge.
- Oh, okay.

19:49.645 --> 19:51.683
Justine:
<i>Social media helped me
become a model.</i>

19:51.683 --> 19:53.385
<i>That's how I get jobs.
That's how I get gigs.</i>

19:53.385 --> 19:56.959
It's really sad to say,
but social media is my life.

19:56.959 --> 19:58.530
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.832
( all screaming )

20:02.637 --> 20:04.975
All right,
I'm ready to party now.

20:04.975 --> 20:07.715
How do you think
that we should fall?

20:07.715 --> 20:09.651
Pretty.

20:09.651 --> 20:11.890
( chattering )

20:11.890 --> 20:13.860
Zendaya:
All right, you ladies ready?

20:13.860 --> 20:15.329
All:
Yes!

20:15.329 --> 20:17.667
I said, all y'all ready
to see this thing?

20:21.141 --> 20:23.379
- Go.
- Zendaya: <i>Tonight,</i>
I'm looking

20:23.379 --> 20:28.021
for someone who is able
to think on her toes.

20:28.021 --> 20:29.759
Who is able to be aware
of her surroundings,

20:29.759 --> 20:30.994
And come with your A game.

20:33.499 --> 20:36.873
Law:
Get in position. Go!

20:36.873 --> 20:39.979
Give us those arms.

20:39.979 --> 20:41.516
- Oh.
- Stunning.

20:41.516 --> 20:44.053
Oh, fab.
Let's go.

20:47.260 --> 20:50.032
Binta: <i>Paige, as
a fashion model,</i>

20:50.032 --> 20:52.203
<i>I don't think she can
stand next to me.</i>

20:56.879 --> 21:00.019
Show us that fringe.
You're selling the clothes.

21:00.019 --> 21:02.758
She's struggling
a little bit.

21:02.758 --> 21:05.864
Binta has such a strong,
boss diva appeal...

21:05.864 --> 21:07.635
- She's beautiful.
- Yeah.

21:07.635 --> 21:09.270
Paige:
<i>...but it's not
my cup of tea,</i>

21:09.270 --> 21:11.207
and I don't
really care for it.

21:11.207 --> 21:13.680
- Law: <i>That's pretty.</i>
- Okay, you can let her down.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.217
Kyle:
I still think my walk
needs a lot of work.

21:16.217 --> 21:17.253
Go.

21:17.253 --> 21:19.090
Hopefully,
I pull it off tonight.

21:21.027 --> 21:23.599
Law:
Work the suit, yes.

21:23.599 --> 21:25.904
- There you go.
- She's killin' it.

21:28.208 --> 21:30.079
She's says I'm goin'
with my hands in my pockets.

21:30.079 --> 21:33.151
- Damn, Kyle.
- Yeah, Kyle.

21:33.151 --> 21:34.655
Law: <i>Kyle was such a boss,
like literally.</i>

21:34.655 --> 21:36.158
Zendaya:
<i>That's why I liked her.</i>

21:36.158 --> 21:38.095
- Like she blew me away.
- Drew: That's great.

21:38.095 --> 21:40.800
<i>I think we've got it.</i>

21:40.800 --> 21:42.972
Law:
I'm so obsessed
with her face

21:42.972 --> 21:45.043
- Zendaya: <i>Yeah, I know</i>
she's beautiful.
-and those brows.

21:45.043 --> 21:46.779
Drew:
Give your legs
some dimension

21:46.779 --> 21:48.415
'cause you're wearing
black pants.

21:48.415 --> 21:50.285
Perfect.

21:55.597 --> 21:57.233
Yes, ma'am.

21:57.233 --> 22:00.574
Chin closer to your chest
for a couple.

22:00.574 --> 22:02.243
You're not nervous at all.

22:02.243 --> 22:04.649
Like I feel like
I was just like,
let's do it.

22:04.649 --> 22:06.284
Go.

22:06.284 --> 22:08.790
- Drew: There we go.
- Zendaya: <i>Oh...</i>

22:08.790 --> 22:11.796
There we go, perfect.

22:11.796 --> 22:13.933
Cody,
are you ready,
darling?

22:13.933 --> 22:15.335
- I'm so ready.
- All right.

22:20.781 --> 22:22.183
Yeah, that skin is...

22:22.183 --> 22:24.989
She's got natural highlights,
she's glowing.

22:24.989 --> 22:26.959
Go.

22:26.959 --> 22:29.632
I was like,
Oh my God, I'm floating.
I'm floating.

22:29.632 --> 22:33.272
<i>It's just like me, by
myself being my own person.</i>

22:33.272 --> 22:37.547
I didn't have my sister there
kind of overshadow me.

22:37.547 --> 22:41.522
Oh, that's great.
Yeah that's beautiful.
That's beautiful.

22:41.522 --> 22:42.725
You got this.
It'll be easy.

22:42.725 --> 22:44.393
- Oh, that was so fun.
- So great.

22:44.393 --> 22:47.867
My turn's coming up next.
I'm freaking out right now.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.103
Dude, kill it.

22:51.609 --> 22:53.111
Tash:
But I got to use
everything

22:53.111 --> 22:54.949
<i>that Stacey
showed me last night</i>

22:54.949 --> 22:56.686
and I just worked it,
worked it, worked it.

22:56.686 --> 22:58.890
Drew: Go.

22:58.890 --> 23:01.829
The leg looks great.
It's great when you interact
with the guys, too.

23:01.829 --> 23:04.535
That's very good.
Really strong.

23:04.535 --> 23:05.971
Go.

23:05.971 --> 23:08.208
- Shake your hair.
- Yes, yes.

23:08.208 --> 23:10.379
- That's perfect.
- That's the shot.

23:10.379 --> 23:13.986
- That's good, Peter.
- The body angle is perfect.

23:13.986 --> 23:15.924
<i>Now interact with
the guys a little.</i>

23:15.924 --> 23:17.226
<i>Give us some action
with the guys.</i>

23:17.226 --> 23:18.663
It's so good.

23:22.369 --> 23:25.142
Justine:
I personally liked
my outfit the best.

23:25.142 --> 23:28.883
It's the most confident
I've felt all week.

23:28.883 --> 23:30.419
<i>Oh, she says I should do
a different leg.</i>

23:30.419 --> 23:32.056
Keep those legs crossed.

23:32.056 --> 23:33.894
She's not aware
of her entire body.
Those legs.

23:33.894 --> 23:35.429
<i>'Cause if you've
got that crotch</i>

23:35.429 --> 23:37.200
<i>you've just got
to bring that leg over.</i>

23:37.200 --> 23:40.674
She shows
that pussycat
one more time.

23:40.674 --> 23:42.678
- I think I killed it.
- Put your legs together.

23:42.678 --> 23:43.846
Jesus.

23:45.917 --> 23:48.121
Some people are just too
( bleep ) much, like...

23:48.121 --> 23:50.125
I'm not gonna
tone down who I am.
That's who I am.

23:50.125 --> 23:52.430
Well, you're doin' it
on purpose though.

23:52.430 --> 23:55.035
Paige:
I'm not really one
for confrontation,

23:55.035 --> 23:56.705
but I would like to see
Binta go away.

24:04.856 --> 24:07.727
<i>♪</i>

24:10.900 --> 24:13.038
Diving into this crowd of
men for our first shoot

24:13.038 --> 24:14.575
<i>is really exciting.</i>

24:14.575 --> 24:15.944
This is the daughter
of a supermodel.

24:15.944 --> 24:18.082
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

24:18.082 --> 24:20.419
Marissa:
Coryanne, her mom was
this supermodel,

24:20.419 --> 24:23.058
and it's cool the
first time you hear it,

24:23.058 --> 24:24.461
<i>but after 60 times</i>

24:24.461 --> 24:26.732
it's just not that
interesting anymore.

24:26.732 --> 24:29.203
Drew:
Don't go in profile.

24:29.203 --> 24:30.106
It's a frame.

24:30.106 --> 24:32.376
Drew:
Pin your face on Peter.

24:32.376 --> 24:35.817
<i>Coryanne I really
wanted to do much better
than she did today.</i>

24:35.817 --> 24:38.890
She's moving too fast.
The camera can't get
what she's about.

24:38.890 --> 24:41.728
Ooh, no, that's not...
I don't like that.

24:41.728 --> 24:43.800
Drew:
She wasn't really comfortable
with her body

24:43.800 --> 24:46.071
and her movement,
and that really showed.

24:46.071 --> 24:48.676
Okay, that's good.
You can put her down.

24:48.676 --> 24:51.081
( cheering, applause )

24:51.081 --> 24:53.920
Go!

24:53.920 --> 24:55.288
Drew:
You gotta open
your eyes, honey.

24:55.288 --> 24:57.126
Open your eyes
and look at Peter.

24:57.126 --> 25:00.266
I had a really hard time.
The lights were blinding me.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.869
- Drew: Keep your eyes open.
- Peter: Open your eyes.
Look at me.

25:01.869 --> 25:03.773
It's like
a nervous blink.

25:03.773 --> 25:08.850
I just hope that there's
one photograph of her
with her eyes open.

25:08.850 --> 25:10.653
I don't wanna go
home over this,

25:10.653 --> 25:14.193
I just hope that panel,
the judges will see like,
giving my all.

25:14.193 --> 25:16.498
Drew:
Thank you guys
for coming.

25:16.498 --> 25:18.770
- Yes.
- No problem.

25:18.770 --> 25:20.105
All right,
of all the girls,

25:20.105 --> 25:23.278
the one that stood out
the most, like a boss...

25:25.283 --> 25:26.317
We're gonna pick Kyle.

25:26.317 --> 25:27.688
( cheering )

25:27.688 --> 25:30.025
Apparently I killed it
and...

25:30.025 --> 25:31.629
I'm pretty proud
of myself right now.

25:31.629 --> 25:33.900
( cheering )

25:33.900 --> 25:35.302
All right, so we're gonna
take a selfie...

25:35.302 --> 25:37.974
we're gonna post this
on the social medias,

25:37.974 --> 25:40.011
so that we can
get those numbers up.

25:42.383 --> 25:45.122
Kyle:
<i>I have no following
on social media</i>

25:45.122 --> 25:47.126
<i>and she has an enormous
following on social media.</i>

25:47.126 --> 25:50.132
On top of it, she's
drop dead gorgeous, so...

25:50.132 --> 25:52.704
<i>obviously I enjoy being
that close to her.</i>

25:52.704 --> 25:56.679
I was really jealous
that Kyle got to take
the picture with Zendaya.

25:56.679 --> 26:00.820
<i>I'm pretty sure she's
gonna have a couple hundred
thousand followers</i>

26:00.820 --> 26:02.256
added to her
Instagram account.

26:02.256 --> 26:05.162
Everybody say goodbye
to Zendaya.

26:08.837 --> 26:10.473
Paige:
<i>Honey, we're home.</i>

26:10.473 --> 26:13.879
I was just starstruck
the entire day by Zendaya,

26:13.879 --> 26:16.485
I was like "come here,
I wanna hang out with you."

26:16.485 --> 26:18.989
You know how like,
you see celebrities and stuff
in real life,

26:18.989 --> 26:21.595
it's like an out-of-body
experience.

26:21.595 --> 26:23.165
I'm not really trippin'
like that.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.202
Hell no,
yeah I wouldn't...

26:25.202 --> 26:27.239
No, some people are
just too ( bleep ) much,

26:27.239 --> 26:31.047
like you don't have
to act like that.

26:31.047 --> 26:34.755
You guys should get points
for the stylist's clothes and...

26:34.755 --> 26:35.857
you're in too much.

26:37.259 --> 26:39.798
Like a lot of people were
doing like, a lot, a lot.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.769
And it's like
embarrassing me.

26:41.769 --> 26:43.673
Thinking they can
just walk straight in
and touching all those clothes

26:43.673 --> 26:45.075
like, that's
disrespectful.

26:45.075 --> 26:46.579
If this is like
a real situation
in real life

26:46.579 --> 26:48.048
they would be
dropped so fast.

26:48.048 --> 26:50.118
I don't know,
I just feel like
some people

26:50.118 --> 26:52.056
are just extra
into their art.

26:52.056 --> 26:54.427
Like I am just
an extra person.

26:54.427 --> 26:57.300
- You're being extra though
on purpose.
- I know, but I'm not gonna...

26:57.300 --> 26:59.370
I'm not gonna
tone down who I am.

26:59.370 --> 27:02.744
- That's who I am.
- But you're doing it
on purpose though.

27:02.744 --> 27:06.051
I really--
this is who I am
in everyday life

27:06.051 --> 27:08.756
and so when it sounds
like I'm getting attacked

27:08.756 --> 27:11.327
for just who I am as a person,
I get like, a little like...

27:11.327 --> 27:15.302
<i>The last thing I wanna do
is upset or offend anyone.</i>

27:15.302 --> 27:18.207
but I would like
to see Binta go away.

27:18.207 --> 27:20.981
<i>I'm not really one for
confrontation or fighting,</i>

27:20.981 --> 27:22.884
<i>so I was just like
"see ya."</i>

27:24.722 --> 27:27.493
Panel is tomorrow.

27:27.493 --> 27:29.063
- Panel y'all.
- Panel.

27:29.063 --> 27:32.269
Going into panel is
making me really nervous,

27:32.269 --> 27:35.409
yes, my run was amazing,
but it's also like
first photo shoot,

27:35.409 --> 27:36.912
<i>I could have done
a lot better.</i>

27:36.912 --> 27:38.916
One less mouth to feed...
just playing.

27:38.916 --> 27:41.354
I'm so kidding.
I think you're fine.

27:41.354 --> 27:44.928
- I'm fine, she's fine. - <i>We
have our first panel,</i> I
don't wanna go home first.

27:44.928 --> 27:46.666
And I don't wanna let
anyone down.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.870
And I won't let down
my supermodel friends
and my mom...

27:48.870 --> 27:50.005
I won't let
my mom down.

27:50.005 --> 27:51.909
It's gonna be okay.
You'll be okay.

27:53.411 --> 27:54.681
Yeah.

27:54.681 --> 27:57.654
I feel like I'm not
a threat though,
like to anyone.

27:57.654 --> 27:59.925
- Like you're definitely
a threat to everyone
- Nah, I mean...

27:59.925 --> 28:01.795
you're like my sister.
Like, you are.

28:01.795 --> 28:03.800
And like, you're
beautiful, you know?

28:03.800 --> 28:05.268
Like you really work it

28:05.268 --> 28:07.808
and just don't let little
stuff like that get you down.

28:07.808 --> 28:10.780
Personally I think I did
good enough, actually.

28:10.780 --> 28:13.017
No. I don't know.

28:15.455 --> 28:18.729
Did you think that I was
being too extra today?

28:18.729 --> 28:20.733
I didn't even notice.
I was so in my own head,

28:20.733 --> 28:22.302
honestly,
I didn't notice anyone.

28:22.302 --> 28:24.440
I didn't think
that I was being
like, "too extra,"

28:24.440 --> 28:26.278
but then again,
what the hell is "extra"?

28:26.278 --> 28:28.950
I ended up in the crossfire
and of course I like...

28:28.950 --> 28:30.887
shrivel up.
I just figured, like,

28:30.887 --> 28:32.824
it's Zendaya,
a pretty big celebrity,

28:32.824 --> 28:34.528
like when I saw her,
I was like "Oh my God!"

28:34.528 --> 28:36.297
- You're not crying,
right?
- No.

28:36.297 --> 28:38.636
- Oh my God,
I was about to say, girl.
- I know!

28:38.636 --> 28:40.539
I was about to say,
Binta always has an opinion.

28:40.539 --> 28:41.976
But we all love
your energy

28:41.976 --> 28:43.646
and please don't change
anything about it.

28:43.646 --> 28:44.915
Right, and I'm not
going to.

28:44.915 --> 28:46.919
And I'm never going
to apologize for who I am.

28:46.919 --> 28:48.488
Paige, I was judging
her at first,

28:48.488 --> 28:50.593
I thought she was gonna be
a snotty little white girl.

28:50.593 --> 28:53.165
She's actually really sweet,
but honestly,

28:53.165 --> 28:56.237
do I see a supermodel?
Not at all.

29:12.838 --> 29:14.073
Hi, girls.

29:14.073 --> 29:17.446
This week not only did you
practice your runway walk

29:17.446 --> 29:20.085
with the one and only
Stacey McKenzie,

29:20.085 --> 29:23.526
you also crowd surfed
into your first photo shoot.

29:23.526 --> 29:26.030
And, you had
a surprise appearance

29:26.030 --> 29:28.937
by the fabulous Zendaya.

29:28.937 --> 29:31.374
Let's say hello
to our amazing judges.

29:31.374 --> 29:34.447
The gorgeous supermodel
Ashley Graham.

29:34.447 --> 29:39.257
Image architect
to the stars, Law Roach.

29:39.257 --> 29:41.461
Our incredible
creative consultant

29:41.461 --> 29:43.966
and Paper's
chief creative officer,

29:43.966 --> 29:46.806
Drew Elliott.

29:46.806 --> 29:51.281
The winner of
"America's Next Top Model"
will receive $100,000

29:51.281 --> 29:52.316
and be featured
in a commercial,

29:52.316 --> 29:54.053
thanks
to Rimmel London.

29:54.053 --> 29:56.458
In addition, the winner
will also be featured
in a fashion spread,

29:56.458 --> 29:57.994
thanks to
Paper Magazine.

29:57.994 --> 30:02.169
And get an exclusive,
one year talent deal with VH1.

30:02.169 --> 30:05.142
First up.
India, can you please step
forward?

30:05.142 --> 30:08.783
- I'd love to go
straight to your photos.
- ( cheering )

30:08.783 --> 30:10.920
<i>You almost look
like you're kind of like
under water,</i>

30:10.920 --> 30:14.460
your hair is like,
laid out in the right way.
So seductive.

30:14.460 --> 30:16.131
Ashley: I don't love
your face here,

30:16.131 --> 30:18.268
and I think that you're gonna
have to figure out your angles.

30:18.268 --> 30:19.805
Because you do
have one eye

30:19.805 --> 30:21.975
that's a little bit
smaller than the other.

30:21.975 --> 30:26.183
I also have a chin
that is a little bit longer
than the other side.

30:26.183 --> 30:28.155
And I always angle
a little bit here

30:28.155 --> 30:29.524
and if I'm
straightforward,

30:29.524 --> 30:31.461
I go down a little bit,
and you see it less.

30:31.461 --> 30:33.498
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.670
Binta.
You look great.

30:35.670 --> 30:37.139
Did you like
to crowd surf?

30:37.139 --> 30:40.278
I wanted to dive
into the hot men,
give me a break.

30:40.278 --> 30:43.351
Shall we take a look at
your best crowd surfing photo?

30:43.351 --> 30:45.823
- ( cheering )
- Rita: Wow.

30:45.823 --> 30:47.928
Binta, Binta, Binta...

30:47.928 --> 30:49.798
Ashley:
That is a rock star model
right there.

30:49.798 --> 30:52.002
You look like you're
exuding confidence
in this photo.

30:52.002 --> 30:55.843
I just wish that you had
just a slight bend in the arm
that you're extending,

30:55.843 --> 30:57.814
but other than that,
I think the photo
was phenomenal.

30:57.814 --> 30:59.651
For a first task,
that-- good job.

30:59.651 --> 31:01.888
- Thank you.
- Kyle.

31:01.888 --> 31:03.491
No, you won
the walk challenge.

31:03.491 --> 31:04.695
No, she didn't win
the walk challenge.

31:04.695 --> 31:05.963
She won
the boss challenge.

31:05.963 --> 31:08.067
- Rita: <i>Hey.</i>
- She came out

31:08.067 --> 31:10.038
swag, confidence.

31:10.038 --> 31:12.544
And Zendaya I was like,
"I like this girl."

31:12.544 --> 31:14.548
Rita:
So can we take a look
at your best photo?

31:14.548 --> 31:18.522
<i>You look sexy as hell
in this photograph.</i>

31:18.522 --> 31:22.129
I saw all of your pictures.
They were all fantastic.

31:22.129 --> 31:23.532
Thank you.

31:23.532 --> 31:25.069
Up next, Justine.

31:25.069 --> 31:27.306
Ooh.
( giggles )

31:27.306 --> 31:29.711
- The giggles.
- Hello.

31:29.711 --> 31:31.548
Justine, I know you just
graduated from high school.

31:31.548 --> 31:33.084
- I did.
- You know what?

31:33.084 --> 31:34.588
I can't believe
you're that young.

31:34.588 --> 31:38.161
When I was your age,
I was working in a shoe store.

31:38.161 --> 31:40.032
I'm just like--
I'm gobsmacked.

31:40.032 --> 31:43.171
- Ashley: Yeah.
- Rita: Let's take a look
at your photo.

31:43.171 --> 31:44.708
Ashley:
<i>The face is fierce.</i>

31:44.708 --> 31:46.177
<i>You've taken enough
Instagram photos</i>

31:46.177 --> 31:48.348
to know exactly
your face angles,

31:48.348 --> 31:51.354
but the body?
It's like "come and get me."

31:51.354 --> 31:53.225
I actually spoke
to Peter

31:53.225 --> 31:54.561
and he said
in all of your photos

31:54.561 --> 31:56.565
your legs were wide open.

31:56.565 --> 32:00.339
Drew:
<i>You're a flailing fish
in a net in this shoot.</i>

32:00.339 --> 32:02.511
It was so hard
to direct you.

32:02.511 --> 32:04.346
If you would have just
been in that moment

32:04.346 --> 32:06.251
and been with,
like, Peter,

32:06.251 --> 32:08.021
and, like, that direct
eye contact,

32:08.021 --> 32:09.223
you would've nailed this.

32:09.223 --> 32:10.893
Rita:
Thank you.

32:10.893 --> 32:13.264
Twin one--
Actually, I'm not gonna
give you guys numbers,

32:13.264 --> 32:15.903
'cause I don't know
who's number one,
who's number two.

32:15.903 --> 32:18.909
Tash, can you
come up here, please?

32:18.909 --> 32:21.749
Ashley:
<i>Ahh. High end. Sexy.</i>

32:21.749 --> 32:23.719
That looks like
a Versace campaign to me.

32:23.719 --> 32:25.890
Drew:
I love that you were
grabbing the guys.

32:25.890 --> 32:27.927
<i>It was like you
were clawing through them,</i>

32:27.927 --> 32:30.365
<i>but every moment,
you still kept your eyes
into the camera,</i>

32:30.365 --> 32:32.436
and delivered,
delivered, delivered.

32:32.436 --> 32:33.872
But just still, ooh.

32:33.872 --> 32:36.444
Every muscle and you were
grabbing, it was great.

32:36.444 --> 32:37.947
I love that.

32:37.947 --> 32:39.718
Rita:
Cherish.

32:39.718 --> 32:42.322
Law:
<i>You see how wide
your midsection looks?</i>

32:42.322 --> 32:44.895
Had you just gave
a little twist,

32:44.895 --> 32:46.464
it would have
been an entirely
different picture.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.736
I don't think this
is a good angle for you.

32:48.736 --> 32:52.442
I don't think this is
a good photo for you at all.

32:53.478 --> 32:56.050
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

32:56.050 --> 32:57.587
Rita:
Tatiana. ( growls )

32:57.587 --> 32:59.591
Ashley:
Just the shape
of your body.

32:59.591 --> 33:02.129
<i>Your face looks gorgeous.
You're grabbing on
to some man.</i>

33:02.129 --> 33:04.667
You're letting 'em all
know that you're the boss bitch.

33:04.667 --> 33:07.239
Law:
And I actually put you
in that dress on purpose.

33:07.239 --> 33:11.147
I wanted to challenge you
a little bit and make it
not so easy for you,

33:11.147 --> 33:13.084
but you shut me up.

33:13.084 --> 33:15.021
Rita:
Coryanne.

33:15.021 --> 33:17.093
<i>See, every time
I take a photo,</i>

33:17.093 --> 33:20.098
I always think,
"All right, what do I want
people to see?

33:20.098 --> 33:21.835
How am I saying
this message?"

33:21.835 --> 33:24.473
<i>You're not selling
the clothes to me.</i>

33:24.473 --> 33:25.909
<i>You're not selling
yourself.</i>

33:25.909 --> 33:27.781
Being the daughter
of a supermodel,

33:27.781 --> 33:29.651
do you feel like you have
big shoes to fill?

33:29.651 --> 33:31.253
I just don't want
to let her down,

33:31.253 --> 33:32.322
and everyone
that knows her.

33:32.322 --> 33:33.792
Don't let your legacy

33:33.792 --> 33:36.197
be the reason that
you leave this competition.

33:36.197 --> 33:37.534
Rita:
Thanks, Coryanne.

33:37.534 --> 33:38.669
Paige.

33:38.669 --> 33:39.971
<i>You have
a gorgeous face.</i>

33:39.971 --> 33:41.842
Law:
I think it's
a great picture.

33:41.842 --> 33:43.178
<i>Had you just put
a little bit of space</i>

33:43.178 --> 33:44.848
<i>between your knee
and your other leg,</i>

33:44.848 --> 33:46.718
I think it would've been
a little bit prettier.

33:46.718 --> 33:48.487
Rita:
Giah, please
step forward.

33:48.487 --> 33:51.127
Ashley:
The muscle definition,
in your body,

33:51.127 --> 33:52.530
you can see hourglass.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.466
You are a supermodel
in that photo.

33:54.466 --> 33:55.903
I love that photo.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.840
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you!

33:57.840 --> 33:59.443
Rita:
Oh, Marissa.

33:59.443 --> 34:01.013
Drew:
I think the worst part
of your shoot

34:01.013 --> 34:02.717
was that we couldn't
even decide which one.

34:02.717 --> 34:05.355
- They were all so great.
- Wow, thank you.

34:05.355 --> 34:07.225
Rita:
Courtney, let's
take a look.

34:07.225 --> 34:09.864
<i>Oh, I just love
the masculinity,
and, like, you.</i>

34:09.864 --> 34:13.739
You just look like
the most prettiest boy/girl
I've ever seen.

34:13.739 --> 34:15.543
Your face
is epic in this.

34:15.543 --> 34:17.547
Drew:
You look like
a beautiful woman,

34:17.547 --> 34:18.849
and you look like
a hot guy.

34:18.849 --> 34:20.720
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

34:20.720 --> 34:22.557
Krislian.
Let's take a look.

34:22.557 --> 34:25.495
Ashley:
Again, you're playing up
the sexpot.

34:25.495 --> 34:27.701
I don't see a superstar
in that photo.

34:27.701 --> 34:30.873
Um, I did feel a disconnect
with the photographer

34:30.873 --> 34:33.979
and I couldn't really
understand the direction
that was given to me.

34:33.979 --> 34:36.819
The direction excuse
means nothing to me.

34:36.819 --> 34:39.223
No, it wasn't--
it wasn't an excuse.

34:39.223 --> 34:40.359
- I was--
- You're making excuses.

34:40.359 --> 34:41.394
No, what I was
trying to say--

34:41.394 --> 34:42.396
No, you're like,
"It was Monday."

34:42.396 --> 34:44.535
And, like,
it's all excuses.

34:44.535 --> 34:46.538
Just take the critique.
Say "Thank you."

34:46.538 --> 34:48.108
Thank you so much.

34:48.108 --> 34:49.577
Rita: Cody.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.253
Law:
Why you so nervous?

34:54.253 --> 34:57.359
I'm just the last person
so I just have a lot
of anxiety.

34:57.359 --> 34:59.564
Rita:
It's all right, anxiety.
It's fine.

34:59.564 --> 35:01.735
It happens.
Growing up, did you feel

35:01.735 --> 35:03.939
that you were
always overshadowed

35:03.939 --> 35:04.942
by your twin sister?

35:04.942 --> 35:07.379
( laughs )
Yeah.

35:07.379 --> 35:08.915
Ashley:
You're like,
"Can we go?"

35:08.915 --> 35:11.087
- What is going on?
- Rita: I'm only asking
you that

35:11.087 --> 35:12.222
because I can tell.

35:12.222 --> 35:13.425
- Can you?
- Yeah.

35:13.425 --> 35:15.395
And it's okay
to be like that.

35:15.395 --> 35:17.567
I have the exact same thing
with my sister,

35:17.567 --> 35:20.272
even though she's not my twin,
we're two years apart.

35:20.272 --> 35:22.643
Tash,
come hug your sister.

35:22.643 --> 35:24.814
Come and hug
your sister.

35:24.814 --> 35:27.119
- Ashley: Aw!
- Law: Yeah.

35:27.119 --> 35:30.125
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

35:30.125 --> 35:32.630
This is a very
beautiful thing.

35:32.630 --> 35:35.302
Cody, this is
the time for you.

35:35.302 --> 35:38.408
Okay? Let's take a look
at your photograph.

35:38.408 --> 35:40.813
Cody:
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

35:40.813 --> 35:42.784
Law:
I'm obsessed
with black '70s models

35:42.784 --> 35:46.290
and it's very Beverly
Peele and Naomi Sims

35:46.290 --> 35:47.493
and I love it.

35:47.493 --> 35:50.933
I admire you entering
this competition

35:50.933 --> 35:53.572
even though you may not
know exactly who you are

35:53.572 --> 35:56.143
but if you go through,
you've gotta come back

35:56.143 --> 35:58.648
like you know
who you are.

35:58.648 --> 36:00.352
- Thank you.
- Ashley: Good job.

36:00.352 --> 36:02.155
- Good job.
- Good job.

36:02.155 --> 36:04.093
Models,
thank you so much,

36:04.093 --> 36:06.665
but now it's time for us
to decide who will be
getting best photo

36:06.665 --> 36:09.604
and who will be
going home.

36:19.323 --> 36:21.293
<i>♪</i>

36:24.801 --> 36:27.372
All right guys,
let's talk about who
did the best

36:27.372 --> 36:28.809
and who did
the worst this week.

36:28.809 --> 36:30.178
<i>Let's start off
with Cody Lee.</i>

36:30.178 --> 36:31.347
Drew:
<i>This is a great picture,</i>

36:31.347 --> 36:32.348
and we have hundreds.

36:32.348 --> 36:34.286
One of my favorites,
Courtney.

36:34.286 --> 36:35.956
- I know you
love Courtney...
- I love Courtney.

36:35.956 --> 36:37.626
<i>...but honestly,
at the end of the day</i>

36:37.626 --> 36:39.229
<i>there's still something
that she's lacking.</i>

36:39.229 --> 36:43.004
Let's talk about
the girls that didn't
do so well this week.

36:43.004 --> 36:47.178
Coryanne, this photo
is not the beautiful
Amazonian woman

36:47.178 --> 36:49.149
that we see
on the runway.

36:49.149 --> 36:52.356
- Krislian.
- Drew: <i>I love Krislian</i>
in person.

36:52.356 --> 36:55.963
But working with her
was a nightmare.

36:55.963 --> 36:57.667
And I would never
have her back.

36:57.667 --> 36:58.836
Wow.

36:58.836 --> 37:00.973
The youngest
in the competition, Justine.

37:00.973 --> 37:02.744
Ashley:
<i>Oh, Justine.</i>

37:02.744 --> 37:04.379
I'm so disappointed.

37:04.379 --> 37:06.551
I know she's 18
and I know she has
a lot of work to do,

37:06.551 --> 37:09.222
she's still a baby
but maybe it's just not time.

37:09.222 --> 37:12.262
( chattering )

37:12.262 --> 37:14.567
Like you have it.
Nothing to worry about.

37:14.567 --> 37:16.070
I was like,
"Oh, I'm confident
about this."

37:16.070 --> 37:17.406
Like I'm confident--
but I'm confident

37:17.406 --> 37:20.579
And now I'm never gonna
ever feel like that ever.

37:20.579 --> 37:23.819
Okay, guys. Do we feel
good about our decision?

37:23.819 --> 37:25.823
- I think so.
- Yes.

37:25.823 --> 37:27.861
- Sure?
- 100%.

37:27.861 --> 37:30.399
Okay.

37:30.399 --> 37:32.002
Welcome back, ladies.

37:32.002 --> 37:34.073
One of you is going home

37:34.073 --> 37:36.110
tonight.

37:36.110 --> 37:40.251
The first name I call
represents the best photo
this week.

37:43.592 --> 37:46.932
Cody.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.702
<i>There's something
about you, Cody.</i>

37:48.702 --> 37:50.338
You came out
of your shell
this week.

37:50.338 --> 37:52.710
So congratulations
on winning best photo.

37:52.710 --> 37:54.914
Thank you.

37:54.914 --> 37:56.918
Courtney, good job.

37:56.918 --> 37:58.354
I think this is
just the beginning.

37:58.354 --> 38:00.593
Thank you so much.

38:00.593 --> 38:03.431
- Giah.
- Thank you so much.

38:03.431 --> 38:05.134
You did a good job.

38:05.134 --> 38:09.142
- Marissa,
congratulations. - Thank you.

38:09.142 --> 38:12.784
Tatiana.
This is awesome.

38:12.784 --> 38:16.490
- India. We love your
face. - Got it.

38:16.490 --> 38:20.733
- Stay focused.
- Thanks.

38:20.733 --> 38:24.440
Paige, Binta,

38:24.440 --> 38:28.281
<i>Tash, Kyle,
congratulations.</i>

38:28.281 --> 38:30.419
Three photos left.

38:30.419 --> 38:32.288
And four beautiful girls
in front of me.

38:36.464 --> 38:37.800
Cherish.

38:41.975 --> 38:44.814
The next name
I'm gonna call

38:44.814 --> 38:47.654
is...

38:47.654 --> 38:50.625
Krislian.

38:50.625 --> 38:53.297
<i>As you know, I wasn't
impressed with your photo</i>

38:53.297 --> 38:55.267
I need that hunger
to come out.

38:55.267 --> 38:57.472
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

38:59.811 --> 39:02.282
Coryanne and Justine,
please step forward.

39:05.455 --> 39:08.328
Coryanne, we have
high hopes for you.

39:08.328 --> 39:10.632
Being that come from
a super model mom.

39:10.632 --> 39:14.841
But you need to be
more than your legacy.

39:14.841 --> 39:16.177
Justine...

39:16.177 --> 39:19.282
you are young
and beautiful.

39:19.282 --> 39:21.020
But your photograph
this week,

39:21.020 --> 39:23.324
it was very elementary.

39:23.324 --> 39:25.629
I want you to do
so much better.

39:28.535 --> 39:30.471
Which one of you
gets to stay?

39:35.516 --> 39:40.192
Coryanne.

39:40.192 --> 39:44.366
You have
so much potential.

39:44.366 --> 39:48.642
Be that beautiful girl
I can see.

39:48.642 --> 39:52.850
Justine, come here.

39:52.850 --> 39:55.187
( sobbing )

39:56.223 --> 39:58.160
You know
how young you are.

39:58.160 --> 40:00.364
You know what it means
to be 18--

40:00.364 --> 40:03.505
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry.

40:03.505 --> 40:04.674
Do you remember
what I told you,

40:04.674 --> 40:08.047
when I was 18,
I was selling sneakers.

40:08.047 --> 40:10.586
Now I'm hosting
"America's Next Top Model."

40:10.586 --> 40:14.527
You have so much time.
This isn't the end.

40:14.527 --> 40:16.397
Come on
and stand up for me.

40:16.397 --> 40:19.402
Give me a hug.
You should be so proud
of yourself, okay?

40:20.572 --> 40:22.242
The judges taught me
that I'm so young

40:22.242 --> 40:24.781
and I have so much
to offer in the world.

40:24.781 --> 40:27.753
<i>And I have to look
at the positive side
of things.</i>

40:27.753 --> 40:31.260
<i>But I'm disappointed that
I got cut off so early.</i>

40:31.260 --> 40:34.399
<i>'Cause I wanted
to do so well.</i>

40:34.399 --> 40:38.007
I wanted this really,
really badly.

40:38.007 --> 40:40.212
This is only
the beginning.

40:40.212 --> 40:42.449
We have a lot to do.

40:42.449 --> 40:44.353
And I need the boss
to start coming out

40:44.353 --> 40:46.057
of every
single one of you.

40:46.057 --> 40:48.260
All right?
Congratulations.

40:48.260 --> 40:50.131
All: Thank you.

40:51.434 --> 40:54.472
<i>♪</i>

40:59.584 --> 41:02.088
We've created
a trademark look
for each of you.

41:02.088 --> 41:05.228
My hair is virgin hair.
It's never been touched.

41:05.228 --> 41:07.767
You gotta
get used to this.

41:07.767 --> 41:11.407
You are gonna be posing
completely nude.

41:11.407 --> 41:13.478
- I am so scared.
- Drew: Cover your breast.

41:13.478 --> 41:16.050
<i>This might be
the photo shoot
I can't do.</i>

41:16.050 --> 41:18.722
Marissa: This is not
"the Courtney show."

41:18.722 --> 41:20.592
You are not
the god damn victim.

41:20.592 --> 41:21.928
I am very bitchy

41:21.928 --> 41:24.299
and I let it be known
when I don't like someone.

41:24.299 --> 41:26.905
"America's Next Top Model"
cannot be decided

41:26.905 --> 41:28.474
by everybody
in the god damn house.
