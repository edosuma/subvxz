01:56.033 --> 01:57.034
Please.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.995
Don't cry so much for mama, please.

02:03.415 --> 02:05.083
Did you just draw a bath?

02:05.167 --> 02:07.920
His face scrunches up when he cries. Look.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.300
I know you've asked for some privacy,

02:14.092 --> 02:16.178
but couldn't the cleaners
at least come in?

02:18.180 --> 02:19.431
Okay.

02:19.515 --> 02:21.308
What if he's hungry?

02:21.391 --> 02:22.434
...for mama, please.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.271
-What if they're not feeding him?
-Of course they're feeding him.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.691
Hey, people don't steal babies
to mistreat them.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.696
Here, why don't you try?
Come on, put the phone down.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.372
Okay.

02:43.455 --> 02:44.456
Yeah?

02:45.541 --> 02:46.542
Yeah.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.210
Hi.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.046
-Hello.
-She doesn't love him.

02:52.714 --> 02:53.715
Hi.

03:03.267 --> 03:04.685
They sent something!

03:18.866 --> 03:19.992
What does it mean?

03:20.075 --> 03:21.410
Actually, that was from me.

03:21.493 --> 03:24.329
I ordered it a few weeks ago
for the baptism.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.248
Cute, huh?

03:33.088 --> 03:37.801
People don't give space suit costumes
for a baptism.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.012
And what do they give?

03:40.095 --> 03:42.389
A silver pendant
with a little dying man on it?

03:42.472 --> 03:44.183
Yeah, I'm the fucking weird one.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.644
My stomach is tight.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.899
It always happens when Jericho cries.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.611
Why is he crying, Julian?

03:55.694 --> 03:58.947
Your stomach feels tight
because you haven't eaten in four days.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.702
I can feel him.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.873
You're just projecting your fears, okay?

04:08.665 --> 04:11.293
He might be crying. He might be laughing.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.255
Or he might be shitting in his diaper.
There's no way for you to know.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.341
You don't believe in anything.

04:19.218 --> 04:20.427
You never did.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.096
You know what you are, Julian?

04:25.307 --> 04:26.892
You're an atheist.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.786
Who wants to go to space?

04:46.828 --> 04:49.540
Yes, you fucking do.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.104
What are you making?

05:54.188 --> 05:56.398
Caramel French toast. It's her favorite.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.942
Yeah, when she was eight.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.614
Will you take it up to her
when it's ready?

06:04.072 --> 06:05.115
Why can't you?

06:05.782 --> 06:08.911
I don't know what to say anymore.
I feel like I'm just making things worse.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.332
This may be an embarrassing question.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.835
What's your current cash flow?

06:17.252 --> 06:18.504
For what?

06:18.587 --> 06:22.299
I'm thinking a ransom demand
might help reassure her.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.759
Give her a little hope.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.053
What should we ask for?

06:26.136 --> 06:28.180
For a fake ransom
we're never gonna collect,

06:28.263 --> 06:29.598
we're never gonna pay?

06:30.057 --> 06:31.600
Have at it. Twenty million.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.604
We need to give Dorothy
something realistic to reach for.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.272
Have her value the jewelry.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.316
As long as it keeps her occupied.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.444
What do you say, like, 350, 250?

06:42.528 --> 06:43.529
Don't be shy.

06:43.612 --> 06:47.533
I think you should put this much effort
into finding them before she does.

06:47.616 --> 06:48.784
-You're burning.
-What?

06:49.326 --> 06:50.327
You--

06:55.707 --> 06:57.417
Free yourself, brother.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.218
The flesh.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.097
Yes.

07:11.306 --> 07:12.307
Release.

07:26.488 --> 07:27.990
This pain is good.

07:31.535 --> 07:32.786
...courageous.

07:38.709 --> 07:39.710
Who's this?

08:22.669 --> 08:26.757
-Sorry. Did I leave my keys in here?
-Where have you been?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.467
I was out front all night.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.552
Julian told me to keep watch.

08:32.346 --> 08:33.804
You cleaned up already?

08:36.808 --> 08:39.645
The party.
Any food left over? I'm starving.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.440
What?

08:47.736 --> 08:49.029
Zip me up, will you?

08:51.740 --> 08:52.741
Sorry.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.619
Are we going somewhere?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.705
Yes. The studio called.
They need me to go in.

08:59.540 --> 09:00.958
You think that's a good idea?

09:01.542 --> 09:04.545
Melanie's off sick, and they need someone
to coanchor the six o'clock.

09:04.628 --> 09:06.380
Maybe we should talk to Sean about this?

09:06.463 --> 09:08.966
I don't need Sean's permission
to do anything.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.425
But Jericho.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.636
Exactly. Jericho.

09:13.428 --> 09:14.847
That's why I'm doing this.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.940
Go in there.

09:28.944 --> 09:30.904
Can you talk some sense into her?

09:30.988 --> 09:33.323
-Not usually.
-She thinks she's going in to work.

09:34.616 --> 09:37.536
It's been four days,
and I can't just lie here.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.706
I need to reassure Jericho
that everything is gonna be okay.

09:40.789 --> 09:41.915
On TV?

09:42.624 --> 09:44.668
I'm not gonna say anything I shouldn't.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.461
But if they're watching the news,

09:46.545 --> 09:48.422
maybe Jericho
can have a little mommy time.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.548
That's insane.

09:51.133 --> 09:53.552
I'm coanchoring,
so record from the beginning.

09:53.635 --> 09:54.636
Okay, will do.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.683
You out of your fucking mind?
Why'd you let her leave?

09:59.766 --> 10:01.143
We need her out of the house.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.026
Where the fuck has he been?

10:09.818 --> 10:11.278
Why you asking me?

10:12.279 --> 10:13.906
Hey, where were you?

10:14.698 --> 10:17.201
In the car, where you told me to be.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.453
I'm gonna have to bill you
for a full 12 hours.

10:20.412 --> 10:21.622
This is so good.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.082
I can't believe how hungry I am.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.793
Do you have maple syrup?

10:26.877 --> 10:28.795
I checked your car every day.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.548
It never moved, and you were not in it.

10:32.382 --> 10:33.425
Roscoe, what day is it?

10:34.635 --> 10:35.636
Monday.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.305
Roscoe, it's Friday.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.224
No, it's not.

10:44.937 --> 10:46.063
It's Friday?

10:49.775 --> 10:52.236
My wife and daughter, they must be
so worried. I need to call them--

10:52.319 --> 10:53.695
Yeah, in a minute.

10:53.779 --> 10:56.365
Cassie's flute recital. I missed it?

10:56.448 --> 10:58.450
What's the last thing
you remember, Roscoe?

10:58.534 --> 11:01.286
What? I don't know.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.956
I was in the car.
It was right after the party.

11:04.373 --> 11:06.667
This lady, she was standing in the street.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.669
I thought she wanted help, but...

11:09.711 --> 11:11.380
I don't know what happened after that.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.092
I feel nauseous.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.262
Get some water.

11:20.264 --> 11:21.473
Do you believe him?

11:22.641 --> 11:25.269
-I don't really know him that well.
-You hired him.

11:26.228 --> 11:29.314
And how many part-time
private investigators did you recommend?

11:29.898 --> 11:32.359
He's got 26 photos
of the inside of his pocket.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.737
There's a 12-second video.
It may have caught audio.

11:39.241 --> 11:40.242
Please.

11:41.952 --> 11:43.287
Please make it stop.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.414
There's no need to be afraid, Roscoe.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.124
It's Leanne. Is that Leanne?

11:48.292 --> 11:50.127
We're here to help you.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.295
Stop.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.047
Nothing bad is going to happen to you.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.593
Why is he crying like that?
What are they doing to him?

11:57.676 --> 12:01.263
-They're breaking him. It's what cults do.
-I don't want to be here.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.350
Was that me?

12:07.477 --> 12:08.937
You were there with Leanne.

12:10.189 --> 12:11.523
Don't bullshit us.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.693
Did she have the baby with her?

12:14.776 --> 12:16.945
I didn't see anyone. I just woke up.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.619
Don't make me take your teeth out, Roscoe.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.997
-I'd like to see you try.
-Wait. Just relax.

12:28.332 --> 12:31.585
If you're gonna play games with us,
just fuck the fuck off.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.087
-Wait. Just wait.
-We're not gonna get any sense out of him.

12:34.171 --> 12:36.590
-He's been brainwashed or drugged.
-Yeah, but he was there.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.800
I can hear you, you know.

12:38.884 --> 12:40.802
Maybe you saw something
that could help us.

12:40.886 --> 12:43.263
We just need to unlock it.

12:43.347 --> 12:45.557
-You wanna know what happened, right?
-Yeah.

12:45.641 --> 12:47.768
What are you suggesting?

12:47.851 --> 12:50.938
We get him drunk? Force a grenache
down his neck, see if he talks?

12:51.772 --> 12:53.273
We call Natalie.

12:54.316 --> 12:55.442
Oh, no.

12:55.943 --> 12:56.944
-No.
-Yeah.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.987
-Come on.
-Over my dead body.

12:59.071 --> 13:01.156
-Hi, honey.
-Hello.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.700
-Where is she?
-Dorothy? She's at work.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.411
Is that a good idea?

13:06.495 --> 13:09.248
Probably not. I'll let Sean explain.

13:10.332 --> 13:11.333
Sean?

13:13.001 --> 13:14.920
We need you to hypnotize someone for us.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.840
He may have seen something useful,
but he's blocking it out.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.053
Well, don't you have something to say?

13:23.136 --> 13:24.137
What's this?

13:24.221 --> 13:27.349
Every time I have a hypnosis appointment
in the calendar, Julian mocks me.

13:27.432 --> 13:31.061
-Not you. The people who you service.
-Because he doesn't believe in hypnosis.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.855
You're misquoting me, okay?

13:32.938 --> 13:35.858
I believe the people who allow themselves
to be hypnotized are weak and suggestible

13:35.941 --> 13:38.485
and therefore occupy a lower shelf
on the social strata.

13:38.569 --> 13:40.404
Oh, but now it's okay?

13:40.988 --> 13:42.906
Pretty fucking please,
with a cherry on top,

13:42.990 --> 13:44.783
will you hypnotize our friend?

13:49.413 --> 13:51.874
I want you
to raise your hands for me, palms up.

13:54.710 --> 13:55.711
Very good.

13:56.795 --> 13:57.796
Resist.

13:59.131 --> 14:01.341
Resist. Resist.

14:01.425 --> 14:03.719
Okay. That's good.

14:04.553 --> 14:06.513
I want you to know this is a safe space.

14:06.597 --> 14:08.807
I will be recording this session
in its entirety,

14:08.891 --> 14:11.226
and I will endeavor
to make you comfortable at all times.

14:11.310 --> 14:13.270
Can we scroll through
the fucking disclaimer?

14:13.353 --> 14:14.938
Just put him under already.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.692
There's no hypnosis without consent.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.279
I wanna know
what happened in the last four days.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.323
Great. Hands, please.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.620
As I push down this time,
resist my pressure

14:29.703 --> 14:31.705
as you count down slowly from 100.

14:33.707 --> 14:34.958
Ninety-nine.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.376
Ninety-eight.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.003
Ninety-seven.

14:39.713 --> 14:40.714
Ninety-six.

14:42.591 --> 14:43.592
Ninety-five.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.387
Ninety-four.

14:49.932 --> 14:50.933
Ninety-three.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.523
He's under. What do you want to ask him?

14:59.441 --> 15:00.984
Where were you, Roscoe?

15:02.945 --> 15:06.448
They've taken me to a... room.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.246
They won't turn on the lights.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.124
My hand...

15:17.793 --> 15:20.379
They've tied my hands with something.

15:21.964 --> 15:24.633
It's straw.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.183
Where did you go?

15:34.142 --> 15:35.394
We never left.

15:36.645 --> 15:37.646
You mean Philly?

15:39.273 --> 15:40.858
The smell.

15:43.235 --> 15:45.445
Something's off.

15:46.780 --> 15:47.948
Rotten.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.577
What can you see? What can you hear?

16:03.046 --> 16:05.132
He's behind the door.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.050
Who?

16:07.467 --> 16:09.970
Take a deep breath.
You're in a safe space here.

16:10.053 --> 16:12.598
No, he's fucking not.
Go back there. Who's behind the door?

16:12.681 --> 16:15.184
Knees! Knees! Knees! Knees!

16:17.936 --> 16:20.647
They're on their knees for him.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.401
They're bleeding.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.320
Can you see Leanne?

16:26.403 --> 16:29.198
-And-- And--
-I think we should slow this down.

16:29.281 --> 16:31.283
His hand is a hook.

16:32.826 --> 16:33.994
Do you see a baby?

16:34.077 --> 16:36.121
Is there a baby? Does he have the baby?

16:36.205 --> 16:38.498
Crying. Crying.

16:39.124 --> 16:41.627
The baby's crying.

16:41.710 --> 16:44.004
-Baby's crying.
-Is he okay?

16:46.673 --> 16:47.758
Four.

16:49.635 --> 16:50.969
Four.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.262
Baby.

16:52.346 --> 16:55.682
-Passing baby forward.
-We need to stop.

16:56.517 --> 16:59.228
Where-- Where he waits.

17:00.771 --> 17:02.606
He's holding him.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.233
What is he doing with him?

17:05.358 --> 17:06.359
Eyes.

17:07.486 --> 17:10.489
Eyes. Eyes. Eyes.

17:13.075 --> 17:16.828
He takes out the eyes,
and he throws them away.

17:44.565 --> 17:48.318
Good evening.
This is 8 News, and I'm Walker Roush.

17:48.402 --> 17:51.321
Coming up tonight,
Christmas toys that can kill.

17:51.405 --> 17:55.284
A shocking story
that every parent will want to watch.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.994
Tonight, Melanie is off,

17:57.077 --> 18:01.123
but joining us on the desk and filling in
is our very capable Dorothy Turner.

18:01.206 --> 18:02.207
Dorothy.

18:03.375 --> 18:04.459
Hello.

18:06.295 --> 18:09.298
This is the news before bedtime.

18:11.008 --> 18:14.803
Let's begin with the gridlock you'll face
on your drive home tonight.

18:15.929 --> 18:19.099
Leslie, how's it looking out there?

18:19.183 --> 18:20.601
You've had quite the scare.

18:20.684 --> 18:23.520
I think you should take
some time to process what you saw.

18:23.604 --> 18:25.063
Why couldn't I remember that?

18:25.981 --> 18:27.858
The mind is powerful.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.611
It does a very good job of protecting us.

18:32.362 --> 18:33.697
How are you feeling?

18:37.117 --> 18:39.870
Well, that was quite a performance.

18:39.953 --> 18:40.996
Oh, come on.

18:41.496 --> 18:44.875
-Were we watching the same thing?
-He was being drugged, okay?

18:44.958 --> 18:46.585
He could've been seeing anything.

18:48.462 --> 18:50.297
No one would do that to a baby,
would they?

18:50.839 --> 18:54.760
Natalie, can you talk some sense
into this moron? It was an hallucination.

18:54.843 --> 18:57.554
No. I recognized everything he described.

18:57.638 --> 19:00.265
I've worked with many people
who have survived near-death experiences.

19:00.349 --> 19:02.935
Oh, my God. There's no such thing
as a near-death experience, okay?

19:03.018 --> 19:05.312
There's a death experience
and there's an alive experience,

19:05.395 --> 19:07.189
and there's fuck all in between.

19:10.317 --> 19:13.737
The woman,
who has not yet been identified,

19:13.820 --> 19:17.032
was discovered on the side of
the expressway on Wednesday morning.

19:17.574 --> 19:22.579
Forensics said her body went unnoticed
for at least two weeks.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.375
What are you doing, babe?

19:27.835 --> 19:29.545
What does it look like I'm doing?

19:31.004 --> 19:33.465
I'm making a ransom demand
out of macaroni.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.593
Why are you looking so hard for this baby?

19:37.594 --> 19:40.430
I mean, with Sean I get it.
But with you...

19:43.308 --> 19:44.309
For Dorothy.

19:46.937 --> 19:49.481
Is everything for darling Dorothy?

19:51.108 --> 19:52.651
Or do you miss him too?

19:54.653 --> 19:55.737
Jericho's dead.

19:55.821 --> 19:58.949
Not him. The other one.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.537
I always wanted to go into space.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.372
Okay.

20:05.455 --> 20:08.709
I mean, deep, deep fucking space.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.544
You know, past the icy planets.

20:11.420 --> 20:13.630
Out of the Milky Way and beyond, you know?

20:16.800 --> 20:20.637
I wanted to reach the end
and just bang on the fucking wall.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.184
Turns out there might not be a wall.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.561
So...

20:28.979 --> 20:30.480
I decided not to go.

20:32.816 --> 20:34.276
Sweetheart, look at me.

20:37.571 --> 20:39.239
I really wanna help you.

20:41.325 --> 20:42.993
I have tried everything.

20:43.702 --> 20:47.956
Cognitive, mindfulness, psychodynamic.
I mean, I've dropped acid with you.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.501
-Nothing helps.
-Because you don't let it.

20:52.169 --> 20:55.964
Sweetie, you have to believe in something.

20:57.549 --> 20:59.676
No matter how stupid it sounds.

21:06.808 --> 21:11.563
Hey, thank you for-- for doing that.

21:11.647 --> 21:13.232
For going back there.

21:22.658 --> 21:24.243
I never use that pocket.

21:27.037 --> 21:28.539
I-- I need to go home.

21:30.249 --> 21:31.959
Spend some time with the family.

21:32.668 --> 21:34.127
What you gonna tell 'em?

21:36.004 --> 21:38.423
Daddy was on a job that went long.

21:38.507 --> 21:40.551
Had some patchy cell service.

21:42.261 --> 21:43.512
Had some bad dreams.

21:45.806 --> 21:47.057
I hope you find him.

21:48.892 --> 21:50.018
I hope he's okay.

21:58.443 --> 22:01.655
And that'll just about
wrap things up for us here tonight.

22:01.738 --> 22:04.283
Dorothy, have you
enjoyed your time on the desk?

22:04.366 --> 22:05.492
Absolutely, Walker.

22:05.576 --> 22:08.245
It has been an honor to get to talk
to the viewers at home...

22:09.329 --> 22:10.539
of all ages.

22:11.373 --> 22:12.958
Well, we have just enough time left

22:13.041 --> 22:16.211
to check in with Melanie
and see how her recovery is going.

22:16.295 --> 22:17.629
-Melanie, you're--
-Actually, Walker,

22:17.713 --> 22:19.256
I'm sure Melanie wouldn't mind

22:19.339 --> 22:22.509
if we use these final 20 seconds
for a charitable plea.

22:23.427 --> 22:25.846
We all know the plight
of missing teenagers,

22:25.929 --> 22:28.015
a cause that is close to my own heart.

22:29.349 --> 22:33.103
Leanne Grayson has been missing
for five days.

22:33.187 --> 22:37.024
If anyone has seen Leanne
or has any information on her whereabouts,

22:37.107 --> 22:39.151
please contact me here at the station.

22:39.610 --> 22:41.069
And, Leanne,

22:41.153 --> 22:42.946
if you're watching,

22:43.030 --> 22:44.781
please come home.

22:44.865 --> 22:45.991
We all miss you.

22:47.451 --> 22:49.328
And if you at home are wondering,

22:49.411 --> 22:53.373
Melanie does assure us
she will be back at work tomorrow.

22:54.374 --> 22:55.792
So, we'll talk to you then.

22:57.002 --> 22:58.086
Good night.

22:58.837 --> 22:59.838
Night night.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.071
I didn't hear you come in.

23:25.113 --> 23:26.114
I called.

23:29.034 --> 23:31.662
Here. Hey, hey, hey. Let me get it.

23:33.038 --> 23:34.206
All you gotta do...

23:35.666 --> 23:38.752
is add water to burnt caramel,
and bring it to a boil.

23:49.680 --> 23:53.100
Well, I don't think they'll be inviting me
back to the desk anytime soon.

23:55.227 --> 23:57.104
You did what any good mother would do.

23:59.481 --> 24:00.899
My stomach has settled.

24:02.609 --> 24:03.861
I can breathe again.

24:05.404 --> 24:06.738
I think he's sleeping.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.034
Yeah. I think so too.

24:36.727 --> 24:37.728
Yeah?

24:38.604 --> 24:40.314
Why is she looking for me?

24:44.193 --> 24:45.319
Leanne?

25:09.635 --> 25:10.886
Sean!

25:12.596 --> 25:14.097
Where are you, Leanne?

25:17.017 --> 25:18.894
Why haven't you told her what she did?
