00:10.177 --> 00:12.347
<i>Back when cave
families lived alone,</i>

00:12.430 --> 00:15.308
<i>we could pretty much
do whatever we wanted.</i>

00:15.391 --> 00:18.020
<i>But after we moved to Ahh! Valley,</i>

00:18.103 --> 00:21.148
<i>suddenly our choices
affected everyone else.</i>

00:21.230 --> 00:23.650
<i>And everyone else's choices affected us,</i>

00:23.733 --> 00:28.571
<i>which, in some cases,
led to a huge stink.</i>

00:29.781 --> 00:32.910
I see the prey.

00:33.994 --> 00:35.578
Bonkers, ready?

00:35.662 --> 00:38.123
Of course we're ready.
Bonkers are born ready.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.709
Yeesh, relax, Bonkers.
I was just asking.

00:40.792 --> 00:41.793
Bait, ready?

00:41.877 --> 00:44.046
Gee, fellas, the beast looks pretty mad.

00:44.129 --> 00:45.964
We can all skip a meal, can't we?

00:46.048 --> 00:48.133
Send in the bait!

00:53.013 --> 00:56.683
Stand your ground, hunters.
There is no beast we can't defeat.

00:57.879 --> 01:00.103
That's not your cue, Sandy.

01:00.187 --> 01:03.857
The beasts are hungry.

01:03.940 --> 01:07.485
Mom, Gran, you're supposed
to be animals, remember?

01:07.569 --> 01:11.031
No talking.
And, Dad, you're standing in lava.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.115
What? Where?

01:12.199 --> 01:17.120
- Oh, pretend lava.
- And Eep... where's Eep?

01:17.204 --> 01:19.998
Hey, now you're running in the lava.

01:20.082 --> 01:23.043
He just told me I couldn't
do that. How is that fair?

01:23.126 --> 01:25.420
Eep, you should come
out to the bone pit.

01:25.421 --> 01:27.714
Everyone's playing "Make Stuff Up."

01:27.797 --> 01:31.258
Oh, sorry, can't.
I'm busy posting to the web.

01:37.640 --> 01:41.644
Oh, Grug, you won't believe what
I just found in the bone pile.

01:41.728 --> 01:43.646
<i>Eep's first kill.</i>

01:43.730 --> 01:45.523
<i>It seems like just yesterday</i>

01:45.607 --> 01:48.317
<i>she reached out with those
tiny, little hands and...</i>

01:48.401 --> 01:52.906
became a top predator.

01:52.989 --> 01:56.159
- Hey there, new neighbors.
- Neighbors?

01:56.243 --> 01:58.061
Meep, I thought you and Snoot

01:58.062 --> 02:00.789
lived across the gorge
in Ahh! Valley Heights.

02:00.872 --> 02:04.251
Oh, haven't you heard?
We just moved in next cave.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.669
See, Bulk and Sulk are
there now. Hi, boys!

02:06.753 --> 02:12.634
- Hey, Mom. It's me, Sulk, your son.
- Ugh. Stop trying so hard.

02:12.717 --> 02:16.221
The Donks' place? They never
said anything about moving out.

02:16.304 --> 02:20.934
Yes, but my father was
the founder of Ahh! Valley.

02:21.017 --> 02:25.272
Have I ever mentioned that, that
my father founded Ahh! Valley?

02:25.354 --> 02:28.217
Only every time we see you.

02:28.900 --> 02:31.153
Well, I simply explained
that to the Donks,

02:31.236 --> 02:32.904
and then I kindly removed their stuff.

02:38.534 --> 02:40.245
They're better off this way.

02:40.328 --> 02:43.039
Their cave's view was wasted on them.

02:43.123 --> 02:46.334
I guess, then, welcome
to our side of the valley.

02:46.417 --> 02:49.462
Right, Grug?
Grug?

02:49.545 --> 02:53.053
- Grug.
- Well, if we're gonna be neighbors,

02:53.088 --> 02:54.968
we may as well learn
each other's scents.

02:57.595 --> 03:00.890
No need, no need.
I can smell you from here.

03:00.974 --> 03:03.185
Ooh, leaf me, leaf me.

03:04.811 --> 03:08.731
Well, this was a...

03:08.815 --> 03:12.735
start.
See you around, Croods.

03:12.819 --> 03:18.200
They seem nice.
They don't seem like a threat?

03:23.079 --> 03:24.371
Oh, one more thing.

03:24.455 --> 03:26.833
Do you mind clearing
your family out of the way

03:26.916 --> 03:29.294
so we can smash your bone pile?

03:29.376 --> 03:30.795
Thanks much.

03:30.879 --> 03:33.506
No, no, no, no! Wait! Stop!

03:40.183 --> 03:43.679
<b>1x04 - "This Means Warts"</b>

03:45.702 --> 03:47.504
Oh, um...

03:47.586 --> 03:51.424
Grug, you're standing in the
way of my giant rock, silly.

03:51.508 --> 03:54.511
Yeah, Snoot, because
that's our home down there,

03:54.593 --> 03:57.763
and, uh, I should not
have to explain this.

03:57.847 --> 04:00.933
Easy, Grug.
Sorry, Snoot, Meep.

04:01.017 --> 04:04.603
Maybe it'd help my husband if you
told us what this is all about.

04:04.687 --> 04:07.940
Well, as you can see,
our lives are now perfect,

04:08.024 --> 04:10.151
except for one teensy problem.

04:10.235 --> 04:13.779
The view from our sun slab is
ruined by your ugly bone pile.

04:13.863 --> 04:18.076
So, we're going to be good
neighbors and bury it for you.

04:18.159 --> 04:22.580
Wait.
No need to fight. Okay?

04:22.663 --> 04:26.154
We're really glad you guys moved in.
The only thing

04:26.189 --> 04:30.296
that you need to understand
is that we love our bone pile.

04:30.380 --> 04:35.468
Oh, Ugga.
Oh, you're too, too funny.

04:35.552 --> 04:39.222
Oh, you're...
Oh, you're serious.

04:39.305 --> 04:41.766
Our kids have played in
it since they were little.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.143
It's not a heap of bones.

04:44.227 --> 04:47.311
It's a heap of memories.

04:47.538 --> 04:50.333
<i>A filthy heap, Ugga.</i>

04:50.417 --> 04:53.086
When my father founded Ahh! Valley...

04:53.169 --> 04:55.088
- Have I ever mentioned that?
- Yes!

04:55.614 --> 04:58.270
Well, he wanted it to be a place

04:58.271 --> 05:00.927
where cave men stopped being savages.

05:01.010 --> 05:04.847
After all, we're not apes.
We don't throw our poo, do we?

05:04.931 --> 05:09.227
No, we just poo it out on the
floor, like civilized people.

05:09.311 --> 05:10.979
So, now that we all agree...

05:15.317 --> 05:18.111
Roar!

05:18.194 --> 05:19.404
<i>Oh!</i>

05:21.091 --> 05:23.843
We should've just moved
in next door to liyotes.

05:23.927 --> 05:26.930
Friendlier, smell
better, and less fleas.

05:27.013 --> 05:30.475
- Hey, you wish you had our fleas.
- No, wait.

05:30.558 --> 05:34.027
Oh, that went bad.
We should probably

05:34.062 --> 05:36.898
do something to smooth this
over, like bring them a gift.

05:36.982 --> 05:38.691
Maybe a dead bird.

05:38.775 --> 05:40.819
- Too much?
- No, no, no.

05:40.902 --> 05:43.780
I am not giving a perfectly
dead bird to someone

05:43.863 --> 05:45.698
who wants to smash my bone pile.

05:45.782 --> 05:48.827
I'm sorry, Ugga, I am
putting my foot down.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:57.169 --> 06:01.506
All right, Croods, time to clean
ourselves up and visit the Boors.

06:01.589 --> 06:03.140
If we have to live with them,

06:03.141 --> 06:07.388
- I wanna get things off on the right foot.
- Then let's ignore them.

06:07.423 --> 06:09.597
You're the only one
who wants to go there.

06:09.681 --> 06:12.639
Oh, oh, Mom, Mom, Mom!
Which hairstyle is best

06:12.674 --> 06:15.187
for visiting the most
important family in town?

06:15.270 --> 06:18.355
Quiet day at the cave, or...

06:18.439 --> 06:23.486
- fresh from the hunting fields?
- Hmm. Tough choice, Eep.

06:23.569 --> 06:27.991
I'd say...
Ah, Mom! Why aren't you dressed?

06:28.074 --> 06:33.038
You said we should look our best.
Well, feast your eyes.

06:33.121 --> 06:35.081
That's not what I...

06:35.165 --> 06:39.211
Oh, this is a disaster.

06:39.294 --> 06:42.755
Yes, making nice with
Snoot would be a disaster.

06:42.839 --> 06:46.467
I tell you, that guy is up to no good.
But he won't fool me.

06:46.551 --> 06:50.429
- I know every form of trickery there is.
- Excuse me?

06:50.513 --> 06:54.559
I'm a stranger you've never met
before who just moved to town.

06:54.642 --> 06:56.769
My name is Snoo... bah.

06:56.853 --> 07:01.191
Well, hey, Snoobah,
welcome to Ahh! Valley, friend.

07:01.274 --> 07:05.195
- May I distract you all for a bit?
- Oh, distract away.

07:05.278 --> 07:07.655
Come on in, have a smash
fruit. Meet my family.

07:07.739 --> 07:10.158
Ah, hello, Croods...

07:10.242 --> 07:14.412
- if that's your name.
- It is.

07:14.495 --> 07:16.122
Hey, what's that?

07:17.665 --> 07:20.126
Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.

07:20.210 --> 07:23.004
Speaking of sounds, did I ever tell you

07:23.088 --> 07:25.506
about the time I caught
a screamu all by my...

07:25.590 --> 07:31.137
Uh, I mean, of course I didn't tell you!
We just met.

07:35.100 --> 07:39.312
It was Snoot all along?

07:39.396 --> 07:42.399
- Whoa!
- I don't believe it.

07:42.481 --> 07:44.901
A new trick.

07:47.195 --> 07:48.321
Huh?

07:49.447 --> 07:52.533
Hey, that's our bones!

07:52.617 --> 07:54.660
Oh, oh, oh! Of course it is.

07:54.744 --> 07:56.829
The boys are just moving
it to a better place.

07:56.913 --> 07:58.831
Lovely Molarbear Ravine.

08:02.419 --> 08:04.629
Snoot!
Where'd he go?

08:04.712 --> 08:08.091
- I think he went that way.
- Thanks.

08:08.174 --> 08:09.342
Hey!

08:12.929 --> 08:16.641
- Roar!
- Relax, Grug.

08:16.724 --> 08:21.187
I know you wanna get even,
but anger is not our way.

08:21.271 --> 08:22.855
What do you know, family?

08:22.939 --> 08:26.067
One of the Croods doesn't
act like an animal.

08:40.457 --> 08:41.582
Roar!

08:41.666 --> 08:45.462
Run! Leave the old bones behind.

08:45.544 --> 08:47.255
Roar!

08:47.339 --> 08:50.925
Grug, forget what I said
about not getting even,

08:51.009 --> 08:56.181
- because this means warts!
- Exact... Uh, what?

08:56.264 --> 08:58.411
Just so I'm clear,
you're saying we're gonna

08:58.412 --> 09:00.559
be annoying to the
Boors, like warts can be?

09:00.643 --> 09:03.729
Something like that.
I'll work on it.

09:12.864 --> 09:16.326
Sulk, we don't eat like
that in this household.

09:16.409 --> 09:17.994
Use your utensils.

09:22.248 --> 09:25.043
That's my son.
Love, would you mind passing the...

09:25.126 --> 09:27.462
Sorry, dear, what was that?

09:27.545 --> 09:29.506
I asked if you would pass me a...

09:29.588 --> 09:31.341
Oh!

09:31.424 --> 09:34.552
â™ª Oh, we're playing in our bone pile â™ª

09:34.635 --> 09:36.554
â™ª Making lots of noise â™ª

09:36.637 --> 09:39.391
â™ª 'Cause making lots
of noise in bone piles â™ª

09:39.474 --> 09:42.643
â™ª Is what bones are for â™ª

09:45.563 --> 09:49.421
- Snoot, can't you tell them to stop?
- No, dear, because then

09:49.422 --> 09:53.279
they'd think they're bothering
us, and they're not bothering...

09:53.363 --> 09:56.074
What is that?

09:56.157 --> 09:58.284
I didn't know a smell could be evil.

09:59.869 --> 10:02.288
Oh, hey, honey, you smell that?

10:02.372 --> 10:05.417
Oh, yeah. It smells like victory!

10:06.773 --> 10:08.044
And evil.

10:08.127 --> 10:10.004
Victory and evil.

10:11.548 --> 10:15.134
Mom and Dad sure are acting
goofy, defending our old junk.

10:15.218 --> 10:16.844
This stuff's not junk.

10:16.928 --> 10:19.138
Don't you remember playing
on... on this thing?

10:19.222 --> 10:21.516
Yay!
All right!

10:21.599 --> 10:22.683
Yahoo!

10:24.852 --> 10:27.021
<i>Ow!</i>

10:30.191 --> 10:34.199
Oh, actually, I do remember
those old ramu skull battles

10:34.232 --> 10:38.450
- we used to have. Those were fun.
- Yeah, the skulls.

10:38.533 --> 10:41.536
- Oh, oh, they're in here somewhere.
- Eh, that's okay.

10:41.619 --> 10:44.705
I just loved those fights 'cause
I was so competitive back then.

10:44.789 --> 10:46.541
But now, you know, now that I'm older...

10:46.583 --> 10:49.043
First one to find
them gets a rotten egg!

10:49.127 --> 10:50.711
You're on!

10:52.880 --> 10:54.299
That's it!

10:54.382 --> 10:58.177
If the Croods wanna play dirty,
we'll give them a bath.

11:09.981 --> 11:11.441
Hello?

11:11.524 --> 11:14.486
Huh. Didn't know water could do that.

11:24.787 --> 11:26.414
Oh, look at the bright side.

11:26.498 --> 11:28.333
At least you smell better now.

11:28.416 --> 11:31.252
Never mind.

11:34.130 --> 11:37.383
Huh?

11:37.467 --> 11:40.677
Dad, do his face when he
got hit by the water again.

11:40.761 --> 11:43.680
Well, I guess
it was something like...

11:46.267 --> 11:47.768
Ah, you did it better last time.

11:54.025 --> 11:56.110
Got it, Dad.

12:02.617 --> 12:06.703
Be good, boys.
We'll be back after we take our revenge.

12:06.787 --> 12:08.080
That's right.

12:08.164 --> 12:10.875
If we can't get the Croods'
pile to the molarbears,

12:10.958 --> 12:14.212
we'll lure the molarbears
to the Croods' pile.

12:16.713 --> 12:18.924
I touched one.

12:19.008 --> 12:20.843
Slimy. Blugh!
Leaf me, leaf me.

12:20.926 --> 12:22.387
Oh!

12:25.890 --> 12:29.477
All right, free snack!

12:29.561 --> 12:32.271
Hey, why is this egg walking away?

12:32.355 --> 12:36.108
'Cause it does what it wants.
I like your style, egg.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.660
- Yeah!
- Huh?

12:51.207 --> 12:53.000
Yeah!

12:53.084 --> 12:55.127
Whoo!

12:55.211 --> 12:57.630
So this is love.

12:57.714 --> 12:58.715
- Huh?
- Huh?

12:59.965 --> 13:02.594
Yep, this bone pile is pretty great.

13:02.677 --> 13:05.304
Be a real shame to get rid of it.

13:05.388 --> 13:07.557
Anywho, is there something
we could do for you boys?

13:07.640 --> 13:11.269
Uh, can we, like, play too?

13:11.352 --> 13:13.187
And move in and be your new family?

13:13.271 --> 13:16.566
Yes...
to the first question.

13:16.649 --> 13:18.943
<i>Eep! Eep, I found 'em!</i>

13:21.237 --> 13:22.530
Best nine out of eleven!

13:22.614 --> 13:24.365
- Ready?
- Ready!

13:24.449 --> 13:26.492
- Ooga booga.
- Grunt and growl.

13:26.576 --> 13:28.703
- We've come to fight.
- Meow, meow, meow, meow.

13:28.785 --> 13:32.707
That line is pure Thunk.
He went through an intense cat phase.

13:32.789 --> 13:35.585
<i>Butt heads!</i>

13:38.546 --> 13:40.548
<i>Can we go next?</i>

13:40.632 --> 13:42.133
<i>- Yeah!
- Yay!</i>

13:44.636 --> 13:46.345
Ew...

13:46.429 --> 13:47.513
Ew!

13:47.597 --> 13:50.433
Ew!

13:50.516 --> 13:52.518
- Ugh! Huh?
- Oh!

13:56.397 --> 13:58.899
What are you doing on this pile?

13:58.983 --> 14:02.695
There aren't enough leaves
in Ahh! Valley to clean you.

14:02.779 --> 14:06.907
Boys, I'm not mad.
I'm disappointed.

14:06.991 --> 14:08.785
And disgusted.

14:08.867 --> 14:11.621
- And mad!
- Well, looky here.

14:11.704 --> 14:15.625
Your sons love playing in our bones.
I guess the pile stays.

14:15.708 --> 14:19.232
Oh, Grug, if I weren't
wearing a pure chinchillynx

14:19.233 --> 14:22.757
pelt right now, I would
give you such a bonking.

14:24.216 --> 14:26.927
You Croods are just the most
primitive, simple-minded...

14:27.011 --> 14:30.640
- Oh, thank you.
- No, she was insulting you!

14:30.723 --> 14:33.058
When my father founded Ahh! Valley...

14:33.142 --> 14:36.437
"When my father founded Ahh! Valley..."

14:36.521 --> 14:38.439
Are... are you mimicking?

14:38.523 --> 14:41.233
Is that supposed to upset us?

14:41.317 --> 14:43.861
<i>"Is that supposed to upset us?"</i>

14:43.944 --> 14:46.656
Why is it so upsetting?

14:46.739 --> 14:48.157
Quick. Do it back to them.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.742
<i>"Do it back to them."</i>

14:49.826 --> 14:52.578
- Do it back to them.
- Do it back to them.

14:54.372 --> 14:57.875
Oh, they're being so dumb!
I am putting a stop to it.

14:57.958 --> 15:00.169
No, wait.
I wanna see where it goes.

15:00.252 --> 15:03.088
- Do it back to them.
- Do it back to them.

15:03.172 --> 15:04.298
Do it back to them.

15:04.382 --> 15:07.092
<i>- Do it back to them.
- Do it back to them.</i>

15:07.176 --> 15:08.803
<i>Do it back to them.</i>

15:08.886 --> 15:10.888
<i>Do it back to them.</i>

15:11.930 --> 15:12.849
<i>Oh, no.</i>

15:12.931 --> 15:14.892
<i>"Oh, no."</i>

15:14.975 --> 15:17.102
<i>Oh, no!</i>

15:17.186 --> 15:18.187
- Sandy!
- Sulk!

15:18.270 --> 15:20.014
- Bulk!
- Thunk, Eep!

15:24.443 --> 15:27.154
Molarbears?
Where did they come from?

15:29.490 --> 15:32.827
Snoot.
You led those Molarbears here.

15:32.910 --> 15:35.377
- What were you thinking?
- Why, I thought

15:35.412 --> 15:37.289
they'd take the
bone pile and maybe your cave

15:37.373 --> 15:39.751
and all your belongings,
but not the kids.

15:41.836 --> 15:43.546
Forget who's to blame.

15:43.629 --> 15:46.006
- You.
- We're going down there.

15:46.090 --> 15:48.342
Yes, yes. Now what's the best way?

15:48.426 --> 15:50.302
Well, just come from the side and...

15:50.386 --> 15:52.597
No, no, wait. Let's think about this.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.932
- What if we lean against each other...
- Okay, right.

15:55.015 --> 15:56.183
- I'm gonna be here.
- Right.

15:56.267 --> 15:57.810
You know what? No, we're
gonna get too dirty.

15:57.894 --> 15:59.896
<i>So, you like this, and me, no...</i>

15:59.978 --> 16:03.315
Wait, Is that right? No, that's
gonna be murder on my back.

16:05.777 --> 16:08.153
All alone, eh?

16:08.237 --> 16:11.407
Well, I know what I'm doin'.
Ha!

16:12.700 --> 16:13.743
Hello!

16:16.328 --> 16:18.372
The kids. This way...

16:20.124 --> 16:25.087
is clearly the wrong way,
so the kids are that way.

16:25.170 --> 16:28.758
While they Crood it up,
let's step back and think.

16:28.841 --> 16:31.969
The molarbears would've taken
the children with the bones.

16:32.052 --> 16:35.556
- So unless my nose is wrong...
- Which it never is.

16:35.640 --> 16:39.560
...they're this way.
After you, my love.

16:42.605 --> 16:44.732
<i>Ow!</i>

16:46.358 --> 16:48.235
<i>Okay, I can lead us out of here.</i>

16:48.319 --> 16:50.947
Just remember,
molarbears might be blind,

16:51.029 --> 16:54.659
but they have really good
hearing, so stay quiet.

16:54.742 --> 16:56.452
Understood?

17:04.836 --> 17:08.464
Sandy, quiet.
Okay now, link up.

17:13.551 --> 17:15.387
Thunk, let go.

17:15.471 --> 17:17.932
But I can't find our ramu skulls.

17:18.015 --> 17:20.685
- Who cares?
- Who cares?!

17:20.768 --> 17:22.185
<i>I'm not leaving without them!</i>

17:22.269 --> 17:24.271
Okay, we can do this.

17:24.355 --> 17:28.025
We can find the skulls somewhere
in the mountain of bones,

17:28.108 --> 17:30.903
surrounded by man-eating molarbears.

17:30.987 --> 17:32.446
Wait.

17:32.530 --> 17:35.616
Okay, we're going the right way.

17:35.700 --> 17:39.036
Wait.
Wait.

17:39.119 --> 17:40.663
- Wait.
- Would you stop that?

17:40.746 --> 17:42.957
- We can see there's only one path.
- Ha!

17:43.040 --> 17:48.963
While your eyes see only one path,
my refined nose can smell...

17:50.297 --> 17:54.719
well, also only one path.
Lucky guess.

17:54.802 --> 17:57.095
Look out, Ugga, and
you guys, too, I guess.

18:13.696 --> 18:17.324
Guys, stop thinking
and whack a molarbear.

18:17.408 --> 18:19.577
We will, as soon as
we get the timing down.

18:19.660 --> 18:21.328
- To our left now. No!
- No, it's on the right.

18:21.412 --> 18:22.329
- Now.
- No, there.

18:22.413 --> 18:23.539
- Now!
- Now to our right.

18:23.622 --> 18:24.749
- Not now!
- Okay, now!

18:26.542 --> 18:28.920
<i>Roar!</i>

18:29.003 --> 18:31.547
We would've figured it out
at some point, you know.

18:31.630 --> 18:33.705
Yeah, sure.
At the point between

18:33.740 --> 18:35.509
that molarbear's mouth
and its stomach.

18:37.636 --> 18:40.723
<i>Thunk, we can get
you new skulls anywhere.</i>

18:40.806 --> 18:44.393
Look, there's a skull
here, and here, and...

18:44.476 --> 18:46.729
Wow, there are a lot
of skulls down here.

18:46.812 --> 18:49.023
- Hey.
- But not our skulls.

18:49.106 --> 18:52.317
Our skulls are the last thing
we have from when we were little.

18:52.401 --> 18:54.361
- Hey.
- From our brother-sister days.

18:54.445 --> 18:56.864
- Oh, Thunk.
- Hey.

18:56.948 --> 19:01.243
Listen, I know I don't like doing
all the things I used to anymore.

19:01.326 --> 19:04.989
- Hey.
- But I promise you, skulls or no skulls,

19:05.024 --> 19:08.709
our brother-sister
days are far from over.

19:08.793 --> 19:10.753
- Okay?
- Hey.

19:10.836 --> 19:14.048
I found the skulls, if you care.

19:43.452 --> 19:45.370
<i>It's this way!</i>

19:47.832 --> 19:49.249
Now look what you've done.

19:49.333 --> 19:52.377
You guys don't care about
anybody but yourselves.

19:52.461 --> 19:55.172
Yeah? Well, you guys
don't care about us.

19:55.255 --> 19:56.966
Yeah, you don't.

19:57.049 --> 20:00.094
<i>Forget it. You go
your way, we'll go ours,</i>

20:00.177 --> 20:02.408
because the Boors and the Croods

20:02.409 --> 20:04.640
will clearly never work together.

20:04.723 --> 20:07.852
Uh, Mom, you guys should
really keep acting like brats.

20:07.935 --> 20:11.450
She's right.
The molarbears are sensitive

20:11.485 --> 20:13.816
to the sound,
or the social awkwardness.

20:13.899 --> 20:16.777
- Keep arguing!
- I'm sorry, what?

20:16.861 --> 20:19.822
I said keep arguing!

20:19.905 --> 20:24.743
Don't tell us what to do, Ugga!

20:24.827 --> 20:29.832
Oh, right.
Yes, we're sick and tired of you Croods!

20:29.915 --> 20:31.125
Oh, yeah?

20:31.167 --> 20:33.961
We'll say anything we want,
and you know what else?

20:34.045 --> 20:36.839
That mud-stache looked good on you!

20:36.922 --> 20:39.591
Thank you. I wish I
could grow a real one!

20:39.675 --> 20:41.593
He does wish he could grow a real one.

20:41.677 --> 20:44.221
And I wish I had your
manly muscles, Ugga!

20:44.304 --> 20:46.431
That's very nice of you to say!

20:46.515 --> 20:50.728
- I like your singing voice!
- It is beautiful, isn't it?

20:50.811 --> 20:54.106
â™ª La-la-la, la-la-la, oh â™ª

20:54.190 --> 20:55.440
Run!

21:02.865 --> 21:04.408
Got it.

21:04.491 --> 21:08.913
I'm blind.
Blind!

21:08.996 --> 21:11.165
Still got it.

21:11.248 --> 21:13.209
Look out!

21:33.395 --> 21:34.813
<i>Aw.</i>

21:35.856 --> 21:39.359
Oh, no.
Thunk, your skulls.

21:39.443 --> 21:44.156
Ah, that's okay, sis, as
long as I have your skull.

21:44.240 --> 21:49.120
Aw, Thunk.
That's a really weird way to say that.

21:49.203 --> 21:53.331
Kids, there comes a time when
all parents have to say...

21:53.415 --> 21:56.001
"We're sorry we got you
dragged off by molarbears."

21:56.085 --> 21:58.879
Yeah, we set a bad example by turning

21:58.880 --> 22:01.673
a small disagreement
into an all-out wart.

22:01.757 --> 22:06.553
Yeah, you really did.
Oh, I mean, uh...

22:06.637 --> 22:10.182
We set a bad example, too, by
stooping to the Croods' level.

22:11.558 --> 22:15.353
I'm gonna miss the old bone pile,
but this is for the best.

22:15.437 --> 22:19.120
I guess you're right.
I just worry we'll never

22:19.155 --> 22:22.903
see Eep and Thunk play
like little kids ever again.

22:22.987 --> 22:27.158
Everyone, we haven't seen
the last of the molarbears!

22:27.241 --> 22:31.495
First team of molarbears to
get their opponents' bone, wins!

22:31.578 --> 22:33.705
- Ready?
- Ready!

22:33.789 --> 22:35.916
<i>Ooga booga, grunt and growl.</i>

22:36.000 --> 22:38.418
<i>We're here to fight,
meow, meow, meow, meow!</i>

22:38.502 --> 22:40.796
<i>Molarbears!</i>
