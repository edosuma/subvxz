WEBVTT

01:02.570 --> 01:04.570
Hiya.

01:15.370 --> 01:17.790
In the name of whiskey

01:17.830 --> 01:20.420
In the name of song

01:20.460 --> 01:23.090
You didn't look back

01:23.170 --> 01:25.720
You didn't belong

01:25.800 --> 01:28.140
In the name of reason

01:28.220 --> 01:30.760
In the name of hope

01:30.800 --> 01:33.350
In the name of religion

01:33.430 --> 01:35.930
In the name of dope

01:36.020 --> 01:38.600
In the name of freedom

01:38.650 --> 01:41.270
You drifted away

01:41.360 --> 01:43.820
To see the sun shining

01:43.900 --> 01:46.780
On someone else's day

01:57.120 --> 01:59.500
In the name of United

01:59.580 --> 02:02.250
And the BBC

02:02.340 --> 02:04.800
In the name Georgie Best

02:04.840 --> 02:07.340
And LSD

02:07.420 --> 02:09.840
In the name of a father

02:09.930 --> 02:12.680
And his wife, the spirit

02:12.720 --> 02:15.220
You said you did not

02:15.310 --> 02:17.850
They said you did it

02:17.940 --> 02:20.400
In the name of justice

02:20.480 --> 02:23.110
In the name of fun

02:23.190 --> 02:25.690
In the name of the Father

02:25.780 --> 02:28.030
In the name of the Son

03:02.020 --> 03:05.400
Hello, hello. Good.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.070
I never said thank you
for taking up our case.

03:08.150 --> 03:12.490
I never thought I'd trust an English
person again, especially a lawyer.

03:12.570 --> 03:15.200
Anyhow, I'll be as brief
and accurate as I can...

03:15.240 --> 03:19.040
with names, dates and places;
anything that might help in our defense.

03:19.080 --> 03:23.460
To explain how I happened to be in England
in 1974 at the time of the bombing,

03:23.540 --> 03:27.420
I'd better take you back to Northern
Ireland, where I come from.

03:27.500 --> 03:31.260
Belfast in the early '70s was total chaos.

03:31.340 --> 03:34.090
It was strange to see
soldiers on the street...

03:34.180 --> 03:36.220
terrified of the civilian population,

03:36.260 --> 03:39.850
any one of whom could be an I.R.A. gunman.

03:39.930 --> 03:43.850
I was just a petty thief
stealing scrap metal.

03:43.940 --> 03:48.320
In Belfast, that was
a dangerous occupation.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.530
Get down, Gerry, for fuck sake.

03:50.610 --> 03:53.160
Tommo!

03:53.240 --> 03:55.450
The I.R.A. had already
given me three warnings,

03:55.530 --> 03:59.950
and when a British patrol mistook me for
a gunman, that got me into real trouble.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.080
What do you think? Trying to fucking shoot us.

04:09.460 --> 04:12.010
- There's a sniper! He's up there!
- Where?

04:14.590 --> 04:18.390
- I can't get a bead on him.
- Shoot him before he fucking kills us!

04:34.070 --> 04:35.990
Fucking bastards!

04:44.160 --> 04:48.000
All right, hurry up
and tell Mr. Kelly, love.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.760
Two suspects proceeding back west...

04:51.840 --> 04:54.630
Mr. Kelly!

04:54.680 --> 04:56.430
Bastards!

04:56.510 --> 04:58.930
We're going to move the guns.
You go and move the gear.

04:59.010 --> 05:01.430
Right. Everyone out, now! Come on!

05:01.520 --> 05:06.190
Get out of the fucking way.
The Brits is after us!

05:07.690 --> 05:10.110
The Brits is after us!

05:10.190 --> 05:13.740
- The Brits are after us! Gerry!
- In here, in here!

05:13.820 --> 05:16.910
Come on, come on. This way, lads.

05:18.870 --> 05:21.740
Go! Go!

05:37.550 --> 05:39.930
Go on, Gerry!

05:43.720 --> 05:45.640
Looks like they're
coming out of everywhere.

05:45.730 --> 05:50.360
- Riot, riot, riot.
- They're right in front of us.

05:52.520 --> 05:56.240
- Who is it? Grab him.
- It's Conlon.

06:14.590 --> 06:18.510
It's your brother! Your brother Gerry!

06:18.590 --> 06:23.810
Oh, my god!

06:36.610 --> 06:39.660
Fucking English bastards!

06:42.950 --> 06:45.700
They've started a riot to cover the sniper.

06:45.790 --> 06:48.660
If we can isolate him,
we can grab him. Let's go, lads.

06:50.960 --> 06:54.960
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go. Move it!

06:57.130 --> 06:59.970
Get that child out of here now!

07:02.260 --> 07:04.640
Move that child!

07:11.480 --> 07:14.940
Shoot that fucking gas now!

07:22.490 --> 07:24.990
Come and fucking get us now, you bastards!

07:32.960 --> 07:35.290
Let him go, you bastards!

07:35.340 --> 07:37.960
Fucking bitch!

07:52.520 --> 07:55.440
Yo, Gerry, I've got a friend
who wants to talk to you.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.440
- Oh, fuck sake.
- We can do this the easy way
or the hard way, all right?

07:58.530 --> 08:00.440
Let's be smart. Come on.

08:02.650 --> 08:05.320
They're taking your brother away!

08:05.370 --> 08:07.990
Where are you going, love?

08:08.040 --> 08:10.830
- We weren't robbing no houses.
- Don't fuck with me.

08:10.870 --> 08:14.120
- Suddenly you're a good boy?
Have you been robbing houses?
- We weren't robbing houses.

08:14.210 --> 08:16.540
Search him. Did you get away all right?

08:16.630 --> 08:20.170
- Aye. Those two.
- Who was it? Those two?

08:20.210 --> 08:23.510
- That isn't mine. It isn't.
- Peter?

08:23.550 --> 08:26.260
Shoot the bastards!
They're always robbing our houses!

08:26.350 --> 08:28.510
Fuck you!

08:28.560 --> 08:32.940
Daddy, Daddy, the I.R.A. has our Gerry.

08:34.850 --> 08:36.770
Go on, show me.

08:36.860 --> 08:39.270
Yo, give him that.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.490
Right, Tommo, lad.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.790
Tommo, get their trousers down.
I fucking warned you, Danny.

08:53.870 --> 08:56.250
Peter, we didn't do nothing, honestly.

08:56.290 --> 08:59.170
- Give you a break?
- What are we supposed to have done?

08:59.250 --> 09:01.260
This is what I'm going to give you.
Now get your trousers down.

09:01.340 --> 09:05.090
You just ran into a house where we had all
our gear. We've almost lost that gear.

09:05.130 --> 09:08.350
- I was just trying to get away
from the Brits.
- But you were stealing again.

09:08.430 --> 09:11.810
- You were stealing lead. Shut up!
- They were shooting at us.

09:11.890 --> 09:14.350
- Get the strides down now.
- Why?

09:14.430 --> 09:17.770
'Cause you'll get cloth in the wound
and lose your leg, that's why.

09:17.860 --> 09:20.070
Peter, give us a few slaps.
You don't have to shoot us.

09:20.110 --> 09:22.780
- For fuck sake.
- Huh. Fucking Tarzan.

09:22.860 --> 09:25.280
Look at the balls on him!

09:25.360 --> 09:27.910
Jesus Christ! Peter! Peter!

09:27.990 --> 09:31.490
They-They're only young.
Give them a chance.

09:31.580 --> 09:34.450
We were just trying
to scare some sense into them.

09:34.500 --> 09:38.920
He was stealing lead again. He ran through
one of our houses and started all this shit.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.750
Did you start all this?

09:41.800 --> 09:44.800
Yeah, he'll never survive in this town.
Never.

09:44.880 --> 09:48.430
This is the last time. You two blow!
And Danny, it's the last time.

09:48.470 --> 09:52.970
- The same for you, Conlon.
- Pull up your trousers. Come back here.

09:53.270 --> 09:56.690
- We've never had a thief in our family.
- We've never had nothing.

09:56.770 --> 10:01.230
- Will you get a job?
- We can't get jobs. You know we can't get jobs.

10:01.320 --> 10:05.940
- I have a job.
- You want me to work as a bookie's clerk?

10:06.030 --> 10:09.990
- I want you to have some respect.
- Aye, respect for who?

10:11.160 --> 10:13.120
For yourself.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.210
We're getting you out of here.

10:26.130 --> 10:31.600
He'll do no growing up in England,
Guiseppe. No family life there.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.930
Oh, give over, Ma.

10:34.010 --> 10:36.770
I'm going to miss the boat. What's that?

10:36.850 --> 10:39.730
- Sausages for your Aunt Annie.
- Jesus Christ, Ma!

10:39.770 --> 10:43.570
- Here you are, son.
- Here, let me do that.

10:45.820 --> 10:48.070
All right, I'm ready. Where are you going?

10:48.150 --> 10:52.320
- I'll walk with you.
- Do you not trust me to get on the boat?

10:52.370 --> 10:54.910
I'm sure I'll be back
when I'm a millionaire, Gran.

10:54.990 --> 10:56.910
Good luck. God bless.

10:58.830 --> 11:01.080
- Cheerio, Gerry.
- Behave yourself, Ann.

11:01.170 --> 11:04.420
- Cheerio, Gerry.
- Bye, Bridie.

11:18.060 --> 11:20.020
He's gone now forever.

11:20.060 --> 11:22.650
I'll be surprised if he lasts a month.

11:22.730 --> 11:26.690
Did I ever tell you the time I jumped ship?

11:26.780 --> 11:29.530
Jumped overboard about
200 yards out to sea;

11:29.570 --> 11:33.530
swam back to this godforsaken place.

11:36.620 --> 11:38.870
Why did you swim back?

11:38.910 --> 11:41.420
There was a woman involved.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.000
Why?

11:45.090 --> 11:48.380
It was when I was healthy,
before you were born.

11:58.890 --> 12:00.810
What was her name?

12:00.890 --> 12:04.650
Aye, you know her name. You know
your own mother's name. Sarah.

12:04.730 --> 12:07.230
Sarah Maguire she was.

12:07.270 --> 12:11.650
Then she had the misfortune
to change it to Conlon.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.830
Boarding all passengers.

12:22.920 --> 12:26.420
All second-class passengers boarding now.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.590
Boarding all passengers.
All second-class passengers...

12:33.630 --> 12:35.970
boarding now.

12:36.010 --> 12:40.560
Go and live. Go and live, son.

12:40.640 --> 12:43.690
That's the best advice I can give you.

12:49.150 --> 12:52.610
Remember... honest money goes further.

12:52.650 --> 12:54.990
Honest money goes further.

12:55.030 --> 12:57.160
A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.620
Never look a gift horse in the mouth.

12:59.660 --> 13:02.370
He had a clichÃ© for every occasion.

13:03.830 --> 13:06.380
I'll give you a call.

13:06.460 --> 13:08.380
Right, son.

13:10.090 --> 13:13.130
I ran up the gangplank to
get away from him,

13:13.220 --> 13:15.510
and then I suddenly felt bad about it.

13:15.550 --> 13:21.640
I decided to turn back to call him
Guiseppe for the first time in my life.

13:21.680 --> 13:25.020
When I turned around,
he had already walked away.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.190
I just called after him.

13:27.270 --> 13:30.230
Good-bye, Da!

13:33.190 --> 13:36.910
Then I met my old schoolmate, Paul Hill.

13:36.990 --> 13:41.910
Little did I know that after meeting
him my life would change forever.

13:47.170 --> 13:49.840
You're under arrest.

13:51.670 --> 13:55.670
Fuck sake, Gerry! Still a head case.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.720
James Bond, license to kill.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.510
- You're a nervous wreck.
What's the matter with you?
- I'm glad to get out of Belfast.

14:08.060 --> 14:09.980
Wherever you going?

14:10.060 --> 14:12.900
- I'm going to London. What about you?
- The same.

14:12.980 --> 14:14.990
I need a drink.

14:15.070 --> 14:18.490
Aye, I'm skint. I'll let you buy me one.

14:39.590 --> 14:43.390
I arrived in London on the 26th of June.

14:43.430 --> 14:46.100
My mother had given me
the address of my Aunt Annie,

14:46.180 --> 14:48.230
but I had an invitation
to a hippie commune...

14:48.270 --> 14:51.360
from my old friend, Paddy Armstrong.

14:51.440 --> 14:55.190
- Jesus, Gerry, we've been
walking around for hours.
- It's only that big on the map.

14:55.280 --> 14:59.070
Yeah, but it's a map, Gerry.
London's a big place, you know.

15:01.620 --> 15:06.250
What I was really
looking for was free love... and dope.

15:06.290 --> 15:10.210
I think it's this way.

15:23.720 --> 15:27.470
Paddy?

15:27.560 --> 15:30.230
- Yeah, what is it?
- We're looking for Paddy.

15:30.270 --> 15:33.190
- Paddy who?
- Paddy from Belfast. Paddy Armstrong.

15:33.770 --> 15:38.280
Paddy! There's some people here to see ya!

15:38.320 --> 15:41.490
- Who is it?
- Some Irish boys.

15:41.570 --> 15:44.830
- Jesus! Gerry Conlon.
- Hey, what about you, Paddy?

15:44.830 --> 15:48.290
Fuck sake. Thought you was
the drug squad. Come on in.

15:52.830 --> 15:54.840
There you go.

15:57.590 --> 16:01.760
Welcome to Xanadu.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.760
Hi.

16:04.850 --> 16:07.390
Jesus fucking wept.

16:07.470 --> 16:09.730
Neat, isn't it?

16:09.810 --> 16:12.390
Deptford Jim. Paul Hill.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.860
- Right.
- Gerry Conlon from home.

16:16.980 --> 16:22.610
Before you can enter the circle,
you have to have the rite of passage.

16:22.700 --> 16:25.530
Open your mouth.

16:37.130 --> 16:40.340
I enjoyed that.

16:40.420 --> 16:42.970
They can't stay. There's not enough room.

16:43.010 --> 16:49.010
Jim! Our rule: no property,
no law... just love.

16:49.060 --> 16:52.640
All right, let's vote on it. If you
want Gerry and... What's your name?

16:52.730 --> 16:55.310
- Paul.
- No.

16:55.400 --> 16:59.480
We're going to call you... "Saddest Moon."

16:59.570 --> 17:03.240
- Fuck off.
- Saddest Moon, all right?

17:03.320 --> 17:06.950
If you want Gerry and Saddest Moon
to stay, raise your hands.

17:07.030 --> 17:09.080
Four, five, six...

17:09.160 --> 17:11.500
- Put your hand up, Paddy.
- All right.

17:11.580 --> 17:14.040
- Eight.
- Looks like we're staying then.

17:14.080 --> 17:17.000
All right.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.550
What shall we call you?

17:24.090 --> 17:26.720
You can call me "Wild One."

17:26.760 --> 17:29.300
Wait, hold on.

17:29.390 --> 17:33.140
Come on. Get off, all right?
Come on, Saffron.

17:33.230 --> 17:36.690
- Gerry, Gerry, Gerry, Gerry.
- They have dead pig in here.

17:36.770 --> 17:39.110
Just some sausages.

17:39.190 --> 17:41.320
We're all vegetarians here.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.570
I'm a vegetarian. We're both vegetarians.

17:43.610 --> 17:46.570
I was just taking them sausages
to me Auntie Annie's.

17:46.610 --> 17:49.990
I have to be around there now.
I'll be back in a few minutes.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.330
All right? Be back in a few minutes.

17:54.200 --> 17:58.540
- Pinky.
- And Perky.

18:02.710 --> 18:05.760
Is she related to the
Royal Family or something?

18:05.840 --> 18:08.430
Aye, she's fifth in line to the throne.

18:08.470 --> 18:12.140
Ferguson's sausages, the only good thing
that came out of that godforsaken place.

18:12.220 --> 18:14.140
Would you like some more?

18:14.220 --> 18:16.270
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
- We better make tracks.

18:16.310 --> 18:18.270
You sure you won't stay?

18:18.310 --> 18:22.820
You're very kind, but we need a bit
of space. We're forming a band and that.

18:22.900 --> 18:25.070
Aye, a rock band.

18:27.650 --> 18:29.950
Where are you staying?

18:29.990 --> 18:32.530
- The address, you mean?
- Uh-huh.

18:34.450 --> 18:36.790
- Fillmore.
- F-Fillmore.

18:36.830 --> 18:41.290
Fillimore Road. Fillimore Road.
Uh, it's number 60... something.

18:41.340 --> 18:43.670
The number dropped off the door.

18:46.340 --> 18:49.840
What do you mean, the number
dropped off the door?

18:49.930 --> 18:52.510
Well, will you let me have it
when you find out what it is?

18:52.600 --> 18:55.430
- Aye.
- And would you phone your mother?

18:55.520 --> 18:58.140
Aye. There's only one problem.

18:58.230 --> 19:02.400
- Hmm?
- It doesn't have a phone.

19:06.280 --> 19:11.030
- Hello, Marian. Any problems?
- No.

19:11.110 --> 19:13.530
- Is it all there?
- Yeah.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.620
Okay. We're in business.

19:15.700 --> 19:18.410
Watch the cracks. Watch the cracks.

19:18.500 --> 19:23.000
- Their skirts are covering the cracks.
- He's cheating.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.170
- I'm a referee!
- He's cheating.

19:40.390 --> 19:44.110
Whack!

19:44.190 --> 19:49.700
Yeah! Whoo!

20:10.760 --> 20:14.430
- That wasn't too far away, was it?
- Is that a bomb, Paddy?

20:14.510 --> 20:16.470
It's getting more like home.

20:16.560 --> 20:19.810
Hello? Hold on, hold on.

20:19.890 --> 20:22.980
Guiseppe. Guiseppe. Long distance call.

20:23.060 --> 20:25.360
- What?
- Long distance call.

20:25.440 --> 20:29.110
- Hello?
- Go ahead.

20:29.190 --> 20:32.490
- Hey, Da. Aye, it's Gerry speaking.
- Ask him for the money.

20:32.570 --> 20:34.910
- Son. I'm fine.
- Aye, how are ya doing?

20:34.950 --> 20:39.200
- It's been six weeks
since you've been in touch.
- Sorry about that.

20:39.290 --> 20:42.620
It's just your ma's been worried,
you know. You still going to Mass?

20:42.710 --> 20:45.750
- Aye, every Sunday. Like clockwork.
- Good.

20:45.790 --> 20:49.130
- Are you working? Good.
- Aye, I have a couple of things going here.

20:49.210 --> 20:51.130
Ah, good. And are you safe?

20:51.220 --> 20:54.130
- How do you mean?
- From all the bombs.

20:54.180 --> 20:57.550
Aye, you could just hear it
in the distance like, uh...

20:57.640 --> 20:59.770
Sorry about that.

20:59.850 --> 21:03.690
-Are you stuck? Are you short of cash?
-How do you mean, Da?

21:03.770 --> 21:06.400
Uh, no. No, I'm flush at the moment.

21:06.480 --> 21:08.940
No problem. No, I have plenty of money.

21:09.020 --> 21:11.280
All right. And, Gerry, keep in touch.

21:11.360 --> 21:13.150
Aye. All right. Bye-bye, Da.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.990
All right, son. Bye. I'll tell your ma...

21:16.410 --> 21:18.330
Bye.

21:19.790 --> 21:21.700
Sorry about that.

21:21.790 --> 21:24.290
We've enough for chips.

21:27.290 --> 21:31.000
- Sorry, we'd only enough money
for two chips.
- Are you all right?

21:31.090 --> 21:35.470
- What?
- There's bombs everywhere.
People have been hurt.

21:35.510 --> 21:39.850
There they are. It's the Irish. Bringing
all their troubles over here again.

21:39.890 --> 21:44.480
Aye, it's all right when it happens
over in Belfast. You fucking prick!

21:44.560 --> 21:48.270
I've seen people killed
in front of my fucking eyes!

21:48.360 --> 21:51.070
- You stupid fucking prick!
- He's not fucking worth it.

21:51.150 --> 21:54.190
- Go home! Fuck you!
- I'm getting out of here.

21:54.280 --> 21:57.660
- Are you coming, Paddy?
- Where are you going to sleep?

21:57.700 --> 22:01.160
Ah, no problem. We'll sleep
in the park or something.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.160
- I'll see you soon, sweetheart.
- Take care.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.920
- Mind your fucking manners!
- Prick.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.380
Troops have entered
the Ardoyne area of West Belfast...

22:10.420 --> 22:14.010
following the collapse of the provisional
I.R.A. cease-fire over the weekend.

22:14.050 --> 22:16.180
Yeah, I'm watching it.

22:16.260 --> 22:20.930
Civilians have been evacuated, and there
are reports of casualties in many areas.

22:21.010 --> 22:23.930
- Both sides are blaming
each other for the collapse....
- Okay, I'll take care of it.

22:24.020 --> 22:28.900
- of the cease-fire which lasted
just a couple of weeks.
- That's it. 8:00 tonight.

22:28.980 --> 22:31.020
No warning.

22:39.030 --> 22:42.910
That's my place.
Yous are sitting there too long.

22:42.950 --> 22:47.660
"C.B." Charlie Burke. That's me.

22:47.750 --> 22:50.630
I carved my initials with this penknife.

22:50.710 --> 22:54.090
No problem, Charlie.
No problem. Whatever you say.

22:54.130 --> 22:57.380
Closing the park. Park closing now.

22:57.420 --> 23:02.140
- Easy with the feet there, Charlie.
Fuck sake.
- It's a big bench.

23:02.220 --> 23:05.310
You're Irish too, aren't you?

23:05.390 --> 23:07.390
Uh-huh.

23:07.480 --> 23:10.560
I come over here when I was about your age.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.070
Did you ever think of going home, Charlie?

23:13.110 --> 23:18.070
Nah, I should. There's nothing
for me over there now.

23:18.110 --> 23:22.320
We're closing the park.

23:22.410 --> 23:25.410
Could you, could you
lend us a few schillings?

23:25.450 --> 23:28.660
- I was going to ask you the same.
- Oh, well.

23:35.420 --> 23:37.760
- Gerry, we've no money left.
- It's all I have.

23:37.800 --> 23:42.760
- Well, now, like I wouldn't
like to take all your money.
- Catch you again, Charlie.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.930
- Come on, come on. It's not even 8:00 yet.
- All right, all right.

23:57.030 --> 24:01.240
We must have just said good night
to Charlie Burke when the bomb went off.

24:01.320 --> 24:04.950
All we were concerned about was where
we were going to sleep that night.

24:04.990 --> 24:06.990
We'd no money in our pockets.

24:07.080 --> 24:11.080
We hadn't even the bus fare to Guildford,
even if we'd known where it was.

24:12.330 --> 24:15.290
No fucking way I'm going back to Belfast.

24:15.340 --> 24:17.670
I tell you that.

24:20.300 --> 24:22.220
- Hey, blondie.
- Hey, sexy.

24:22.300 --> 24:24.220
You dropped something.

24:24.300 --> 24:27.180
Fuck off, paddy. She's out of your league.

24:27.260 --> 24:29.600
Let's see her.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.940
It's her fucking keys. I'm going in.

24:39.030 --> 24:41.650
We should give them back, Gerry.
Put them through the letter box.

24:41.740 --> 24:44.700
Put the keys back in the letter box, Gerry.

25:18.230 --> 25:20.190
Jesus Christ.

25:33.960 --> 25:37.250
Come on, Paul.

25:37.330 --> 25:40.710
Jesus Christ, how much money is there?

25:43.880 --> 25:47.470
I got Â£700 from the hooker's apartment.

25:47.550 --> 25:50.140
I did feel a little bit guilty about that.

25:50.220 --> 25:53.480
We spent that night in a hotel.

25:53.560 --> 25:57.190
The next day we went and
bought the same clothes.

25:57.270 --> 26:01.230
The same trousers, same jackets.
Even the same shoes.

26:06.450 --> 26:09.910
Baaa.

26:13.250 --> 26:17.830
Has that coat got fleas?

26:39.560 --> 26:43.190
Who are those two gorgeous
women in the kitchen?

26:43.280 --> 26:46.280
- Gerard?
- Did you miss me, Bridie?

26:46.360 --> 26:49.490
Look at Gerry. He's, he's a hippie.

26:49.570 --> 26:52.700
- Daddy, look at the money.
- Do you want it?

26:54.910 --> 26:58.170
Yes, Gerry, I want to be in your gang.
I want to be in your gang.

27:00.460 --> 27:03.960
Take it easy. Hey, calm it down.

27:04.050 --> 27:06.800
It's my money! It's mine!

27:06.840 --> 27:10.340
- Calm down. Stop it.
- It's my money. He gave it to me!

27:10.430 --> 27:12.720
Stop that!

27:17.430 --> 27:21.060
And they were always
talking about the troubles, were they?

27:21.150 --> 27:24.020
Yeah. Especially Paul Hill.

27:24.070 --> 27:28.030
He was always talking about Belfast,
the I.R.A., all that stuff.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.830
Look, all I'm saying is this,

27:32.910 --> 27:36.660
They had a lot of money,
and Conlon went back to Belfast.

27:36.700 --> 27:39.330
- Come along, into the car.
- What's going on?

27:41.420 --> 27:44.840
- That was a bloody disgrace,
them shooting you.
- Aye.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.210
- Did it hurt you, Danny?
- Ah, it wasn't too bad.

27:47.300 --> 27:50.720
The bullet bounced off the knee
and come out the other side.

27:50.800 --> 27:54.100
Five people are dead
and 75 seriously injured...

27:54.180 --> 27:57.680
as a result of the I.R.A.'s
bomb attack on a Guildford pub.

27:57.770 --> 28:01.230
Parliament has passed
the Prevention of Terrorism Act,

28:01.270 --> 28:04.860
which allows terrorist suspects to be held
in police custody for up to seven days.

28:04.940 --> 28:07.690
Seven days. Geez.

28:07.730 --> 28:10.570
It's the same here.
Seven days. No difference.

28:10.650 --> 28:14.780
...inside London and arrested 19 suspects.

28:14.870 --> 28:17.040
Gerry, there's your shoes.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.620
I later spoke to Commander Robert Dixon...

28:19.710 --> 28:23.790
- X's up.
- of the anti-terrorist squad
about those arrests.

28:23.880 --> 28:27.920
Some of them may not deserve it.
We shall use these powers...

28:28.010 --> 28:30.420
as selectively as possible.

28:37.010 --> 28:40.930
- Get up out of bed,
you dirty, murdering bastard!
- Hands above your head!

28:41.020 --> 28:46.060
I don't know what the fuck yous
are looking for, mister, but I'm not it.

28:46.110 --> 28:48.440
Gerry, your coat. He's done nothing.

28:48.530 --> 28:52.910
- Inside, sir.
- He's not political. I have
a right to speak to my son.

28:52.950 --> 28:55.280
- Da! Da!
- Keep calm, Gerry.

28:57.490 --> 29:00.000
Get back in. Get back inside.

29:02.460 --> 29:06.420
It's all right.
It's all right. Come on now.

29:20.020 --> 29:23.100
- Where are we going?
- You'll find out soon enough.

29:24.810 --> 29:28.360
- Where'd he get this money?
- I don't know.

29:30.440 --> 29:33.110
They have no right to take him to England.

30:29.210 --> 30:33.170
I don't have a fucking clue
what this is about, so I don't.

30:37.890 --> 30:40.350
I've done nothing wrong.

30:49.900 --> 30:52.230
I've done nothing wrong.

30:56.530 --> 30:58.610
When can I go back to Belfast?

30:58.700 --> 31:02.530
The next time you see Belfast they'll
be flying day trips to the moon.

31:02.580 --> 31:05.250
I always wanted to be an astronaut.

31:15.550 --> 31:17.550
What are you charging me with?

31:17.630 --> 31:21.470
- You're being held under
the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
- What?

31:21.550 --> 31:25.270
We can hold you for seven days
and seven nights without charging you.

31:25.350 --> 31:27.600
Since when was I a fucking terrorist?

31:27.680 --> 31:30.900
Remember that, Gerry? Hmm? Remember that?

31:30.940 --> 31:33.820
And that. You proud of that?

31:35.230 --> 31:38.900
- And that.
- What are you showing me these for?

31:38.990 --> 31:43.330
No marks! Don't mark him! Don't mark him!

31:43.410 --> 31:45.490
- Are you proud of that?
- Huh?

31:45.580 --> 31:48.580
Look at that young, pretty girl there!

31:48.660 --> 31:51.920
- Now look at her!
- You're out of your fucking minds!

31:52.000 --> 31:55.800
- Are you?
- You're out of your fucking minds!

31:55.880 --> 32:00.430
The children know there's something
terrible going on, and you're not making
it easier.

32:00.470 --> 32:02.590
I haven't the strength for this.

32:02.640 --> 32:05.810
If he killed innocent people,
I haven't the strength for it.

32:05.890 --> 32:07.980
I know that child. I carried that child.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.350
If you're not going to believe
in him, I will.

32:10.440 --> 32:14.940
- You think he's innocent?
- When your son walked through
that door looking like a clown,

32:15.020 --> 32:17.360
do you think he had murder in his eyes?

32:19.490 --> 32:22.610
- It's a surprise.
- Shut up. Shut up!

32:37.170 --> 32:39.300
When will Daddy be back?

32:39.380 --> 32:42.010
He'll be back in a couple of days.

32:42.090 --> 32:45.140
Why did they put Gerry in jail?

32:45.180 --> 32:47.350
It's a mistake.

32:47.430 --> 32:50.890
I'm on my way over to bring him back home.

32:50.980 --> 32:53.900
Why are you getting narky again?

32:53.980 --> 32:56.690
Eh? Are we touching a sore spot?

32:56.770 --> 32:59.900
Name all the places you stayed
while you were in England.

32:59.990 --> 33:03.070
- I told you about 100 times.
- Then tell us again!

33:07.120 --> 33:09.040
I stayed at the squat most of the time.

33:09.120 --> 33:11.580
I was a couple of nights
at my Auntie Annie's,

33:11.660 --> 33:14.170
and one night at the hotel
after I robbed the money.

33:29.890 --> 33:32.390
Male. Late forties.

33:32.430 --> 33:35.850
Who taught you how to make the bomb, Gerry?

33:35.900 --> 33:38.230
I never made any bombs.

33:38.270 --> 33:42.360
Did Annie make the bomb, Gerry?

33:42.400 --> 33:46.030
Is Annie Marian, Gerry?

33:46.070 --> 33:50.200
- Is Annie Marian?
- Annie who?

33:50.290 --> 33:53.790
- Annie Maguire.
- My Aunt Annie?

33:53.870 --> 33:57.420
Oh, aye, Annie made the bomb,
and Mother Teresa planted it.

33:57.500 --> 34:00.710
What was Carole Richardson's
part in this operation?

34:00.800 --> 34:03.260
Are you Marian?

34:05.430 --> 34:09.050
- What?
- Are you Marian?

34:09.100 --> 34:12.640
She had nothing to do with it.

34:16.690 --> 34:19.400
This man comes into my house.
He puts a gun to my head.

34:19.440 --> 34:22.070
He says I done Guildford.

34:22.110 --> 34:26.070
I left Belfast to get away
from people like him.

34:26.110 --> 34:30.410
Show me what you want me to sign.
I have an alibi for that night.

34:35.120 --> 34:37.710
What are you showing me these for?

34:39.290 --> 34:41.800
Gerry told us you did it.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.300
Then he's a fucking liar.

34:44.380 --> 34:49.300
Armstrong drove the car.
Who was the woman in the back?

34:51.680 --> 34:54.180
I don't know.

34:54.270 --> 34:56.850
But you were in the Ford Cortina.

34:56.940 --> 34:59.310
But you were in the red Ford Cortina.

34:59.350 --> 35:02.860
He'll get used to your methods,
and then he'll clam up.

35:02.940 --> 35:07.110
I told you I was... I told you I was in
the Cortina. I told you it was a taxi.

35:07.200 --> 35:09.820
No. The taxi was a Toyota Corolla.

35:09.910 --> 35:12.530
When can I ring home?

35:12.620 --> 35:15.700
- Let's start again. Who's Marian?
- Was it someone Irish?

35:15.790 --> 35:20.380
- Gerry, who is she?
- Why are you getting narky?
Are we touching a sore spot?

35:20.460 --> 35:24.000
- Nothing to do with what, Gerry?
- Talk to me.

35:24.090 --> 35:26.420
You're evading the truth, Gerry.
What was her name?

35:26.510 --> 35:30.260
Two little girls asked me,
"Why was Daddy blown up?"

35:30.340 --> 35:33.310
Who taught you how to make the bomb, Gerry?

35:33.390 --> 35:37.850
Gerry, talk to me.

35:42.520 --> 35:44.440
No.

35:44.530 --> 35:47.650
He'll do what he's told.

35:47.740 --> 35:49.990
Look at him. He's a lying bastard.

35:50.070 --> 35:52.370
He's a fucking comedian, aren't you, Gerry?

35:52.450 --> 35:57.200
Who's Marian? I'm getting fucking
bored with this. Who is Marian?

35:57.290 --> 36:02.080
- I don't know any Marian.
- I'm going to keep on asking until
you give me a fucking answer!

36:02.170 --> 36:04.500
- Who is Marian?
- I don't know.

36:04.550 --> 36:08.380
Yes, you fucking do! Bollocks!
Who is Marian?

36:10.340 --> 36:13.260
We know who Marian is.

36:15.810 --> 36:18.600
Hey.

36:22.560 --> 36:25.860
Are you the man in charge?

36:25.940 --> 36:30.320
- Yes, I am.
- For fuck sake, tell them
to stop hurting me.

36:33.820 --> 36:35.740
I swear to God I...

36:35.830 --> 36:39.710
I know where I was
at the time of the bombings.

36:42.580 --> 36:46.840
I was with a man,
a man called Charlie Burke.

36:46.920 --> 36:49.590
Have you any other alibis?

36:49.670 --> 36:52.590
I have told you before,

36:52.680 --> 36:55.510
I was with Paul Hill most of the day.

37:00.230 --> 37:03.560
All right, come with us.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.770
Tell Gerry Conlon like you said you would.

37:12.530 --> 37:16.280
- Who's this?
- Gerry Conlon.

37:21.210 --> 37:23.920
Have you anything to say to him?

37:23.960 --> 37:26.750
I've cleared my conscience.

37:26.840 --> 37:29.590
I advise you to do the same.

37:43.770 --> 37:45.770
There's his statement.

37:45.810 --> 37:50.610
But... I didn't do this.

37:50.650 --> 37:53.860
I didn't fucking do this!

37:53.950 --> 37:58.450
I didn't... do this.

37:58.490 --> 38:01.410
Please believe me.

38:01.500 --> 38:04.410
What are you doing to me?

38:08.840 --> 38:14.050
They wouldn't hold him
if he hadn't done something.

38:14.130 --> 38:16.430
- Gerry is no angel.
- I know that.

38:16.510 --> 38:19.560
He needs a strong hand.

38:19.640 --> 38:24.430
You're all under arrest.

38:24.520 --> 38:28.400
No, no, don't. Don't hurt the child.

38:28.480 --> 38:31.610
You're all being held under
the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

38:38.700 --> 38:42.910
- Is Hill leading us up the garden path?
- I don't know.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.870
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.920
I can make him confess.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.170
Why don't you have a word in his ear?

38:53.210 --> 38:56.010
You're from the same town.
He'll understand you.

38:56.090 --> 38:58.180
Will you have the bomber?

38:58.260 --> 39:00.930
Our job is to stop the bombing.

40:02.410 --> 40:04.700
I'm going to shoot your Da.

40:07.040 --> 40:09.250
What did you say to me?

40:10.710 --> 40:14.670
Little Bridie will have no daddy.

40:14.750 --> 40:16.880
I'm going to shoot Guiseppe.

40:25.470 --> 40:28.560
- Hey, hey.
- He's threatening to shoot my Da!

40:28.640 --> 40:31.770
He's threatening to kill my Da!

40:31.850 --> 40:34.940
Look at him! Look at him!

40:34.980 --> 40:37.690
Look at him! He's a madman!

40:37.780 --> 40:42.280
I think you're hallucinating.
Nobody's going to harm your father.

40:42.320 --> 40:45.780
Get him back. Get him back.

40:45.870 --> 40:48.790
He threatened to kill my Da.

40:48.830 --> 40:50.830
Nobody's going to kill your father.

40:50.870 --> 40:53.830
- You mad bastard!
- Take it easy, son. Take it easy.

40:55.630 --> 40:58.590
He's not going to harm your father.

40:58.670 --> 41:01.510
Come on, let it all out.

41:01.590 --> 41:05.800
Let it all out, all that hatred.

41:07.890 --> 41:10.140
You hate us, don't you? Hmm?

41:10.230 --> 41:12.850
You hate us enough to bomb and maim.

41:12.940 --> 41:15.560
That is the trouble. You let it all out.

41:15.650 --> 41:19.030
- Come on, boy. Let it all out.
- I don't hate you.

41:19.110 --> 41:23.160
Yes, you do. I can see it in
your face. I can see all that hatred.

41:23.240 --> 41:25.620
So why don't you just let it
off your chest...

41:25.700 --> 41:28.620
before it starts to mess up
with your mind, hmm?

41:31.710 --> 41:35.670
Give me the fucking statement.

41:35.710 --> 41:39.840
For fuck sake, give me the statement.

41:41.130 --> 41:43.800
Give me a fucking pen.

41:50.970 --> 41:55.480
Right, that's my fucking name there.
You can write what you like.

41:57.190 --> 41:59.900
All right, nice and easy. Come on.

41:59.980 --> 42:03.610
- Paul! Paul! What's going on?
- Gerry!

42:03.700 --> 42:06.160
They stuck a fucking gun in my mouth!

42:06.240 --> 42:08.990
So I told them a lot of bullshit!

42:09.080 --> 42:11.660
- What did you give them my
fucking name for?
- I'm sorry!

42:11.750 --> 42:15.670
It's fucking mad! It'll be
laughed out of fucking court!

42:15.750 --> 42:18.130
It'll be laughed out of fucking court!

42:18.210 --> 42:20.880
The four of us were split up.

42:20.960 --> 42:23.720
I was taken to South London Remand Center.

42:23.800 --> 42:26.390
You can check the dates, Gareth.

42:32.810 --> 42:35.350
Kill that fucker!

42:37.980 --> 42:41.900
You fucking son of an Irish punk!

42:41.940 --> 42:45.900
- That Irish bastard!
- Kick him in the ass!

42:45.950 --> 42:49.200
Kick that Irish in his fucking ass!

42:49.280 --> 42:51.240
- What is that?
- Delousing.

42:51.330 --> 42:54.710
- I don't have fucking lice.
I don't want that.
- You have no choice, mate.

42:54.790 --> 42:57.500
You'll never clean
the scum off that garbage.

42:57.580 --> 43:00.960
Okay, Conlon. Go see the room, shall we?

43:01.040 --> 43:03.010
Get his butt kicked in!

43:03.090 --> 43:05.630
Come on, lads, let's move it.

43:05.720 --> 43:07.800
Come on, Mr. Conlon, let's go.

43:07.890 --> 43:11.970
- I don't need delousing.
- No choice. Turn around.

43:13.180 --> 43:18.190
We got your son. Now, let's go, shall we?

43:18.270 --> 43:20.810
- I'll lead you right to him.
- Okay.

43:20.900 --> 43:24.650
- Da! No! Da!
- Is that you, son?

43:24.740 --> 43:28.200
- Da, here!
- Where are you?

43:28.280 --> 43:31.660
What have they done to you?

43:31.700 --> 43:35.450
- Don't you hurt him! Don't hurt my father!
- Son!

43:35.540 --> 43:40.000
- Are you all right, son?
- Don't kill him! Da!

43:42.540 --> 43:45.960
Come on, move along.
Move along. Come on, you.

43:46.010 --> 43:49.970
- Fuck you, I'm going out.
- Shut up, you!

43:50.050 --> 43:53.350
- Shut up!
- On the floor!

43:59.690 --> 44:02.770
Kill him! Kill him!

44:02.860 --> 44:05.820
Oh, what the fuck are you doing here, Da?

44:05.900 --> 44:10.860
I come over to your Aunt Annie's to get you
a lawyer... and they arrested everybody.

44:10.910 --> 44:12.870
What?

44:12.950 --> 44:15.910
- What for, fuck sake?
- Conspiracy to murder.

44:15.990 --> 44:19.250
Oh, no. Oh, fuck sake, no. Please.

44:22.290 --> 44:25.380
Did you do it?

44:25.460 --> 44:27.670
Did you do it, son?

44:27.760 --> 44:30.130
No, I did not!

44:33.890 --> 44:37.350
Of course I fucking didn't
do it, fuck sake!

44:46.400 --> 44:48.860
What are you looking at me like that?

44:48.900 --> 44:51.450
Like what?

44:52.530 --> 44:55.490
Why are you looking at me like that?

44:55.580 --> 45:00.210
- Like what?
- Why do always follow me? Huh?

45:01.620 --> 45:04.880
Why do you always follow me
when I do something wrong?

45:04.920 --> 45:08.710
- Why can't you follow me
when I do something right?
- What are you talking about?

45:08.800 --> 45:12.380
- What am I talking about?
I'm talking about the medal.
- What medal?

45:12.470 --> 45:15.430
What fucking medal? What fucking medal!

45:15.470 --> 45:19.810
The only fucking medal that was
ever in our house. That fucking medal.

45:19.890 --> 45:22.560
The medal I won at football.

45:22.640 --> 45:26.610
And you sat on the sidelines
shouting instructions like you
could only see what I was doing.

45:26.650 --> 45:31.860
You couldn't even fucking play football. And
you could only see what I was doing wrong.

45:31.950 --> 45:36.910
I could never do anything good enough
for you. After the game, you came up
to me and said,

45:36.990 --> 45:39.910
"Gerry, did you foul the ball?"

45:39.950 --> 45:43.540
And I walked away from you, remember?
I walked away into the dressing room.

45:43.620 --> 45:47.000
You followed me in there and said again,
"Gerry, did you foul the ball?"

45:47.090 --> 45:51.220
All the fathers were in there and they were
laughing at you, calling you "Poor Guiseppe."

45:51.300 --> 45:54.640
And I ran out, and I hid, and
I wrote your name on the ground.

45:54.720 --> 46:00.100
Your stupid Guiseppe fucking name. I wrote
it in the dirt and I fucking pissed on it!

46:00.140 --> 46:02.850
I pissed on it!

46:02.940 --> 46:06.730
Because I did foul the ball.
What did it matter? We won.

46:06.810 --> 46:10.860
For once in our lives, we won.
You ruined that medal for me!

46:10.940 --> 46:14.200
I took it to the pawn. They wouldn't
even give me fifty pence for it.

46:14.280 --> 46:19.540
- It's the shock.
- That's when I started to rob
to prove that I was no good.

46:19.620 --> 46:22.290
- Delayed shock.
- Never mind delayed shock.

46:22.330 --> 46:25.040
I've been like this since I was seven.

46:25.120 --> 46:28.460
I remember Mammy said to me,
"Don't upset Guiseppe; he's not well."

46:28.500 --> 46:32.510
Oh, dear Lord. "He's not well, so tiptoe
around the house." Like this, huh?

46:32.590 --> 46:35.510
"Better tiptoe around the house
like that. You know, he's not well."

46:35.550 --> 46:40.970
I got holy communion, I thought I was
eating you alive. Was it my fault
you were never well?

46:41.010 --> 46:45.770
Why did you have to be sick, Guiseppe,
huh? What'd you have to be sick all
your life for?

46:45.850 --> 46:50.480
When that mad bastard out there threatened
to shoot you, I was happy. I swear to God.

46:50.570 --> 46:54.530
Honest to God, I was happy.
I was delighted! You know why?
Because finally it was all over.

46:54.570 --> 46:57.700
It was over! You see?

46:57.780 --> 47:02.870
And then I knew I was bad. I knew I was
bad then, you see, so I started to cry.

47:02.950 --> 47:08.040
I started to tell lies. Same
fucking lies I've been telling
all my gob-shite fucking life.

47:08.130 --> 47:10.590
Huh?

47:12.750 --> 47:15.880
You know what that
means? It means words don't mean anything.

47:15.970 --> 47:19.510
- Stop this.
- Huh? Only this time,
I got everyone into trouble.

47:19.600 --> 47:22.600
But it doesn't matter. 'Cause I'm
no good anyhow. It doesn't matter.

47:22.680 --> 47:27.190
Keep away from me.
You've been following me all your life,
and now here you are in jail.

47:27.270 --> 47:29.690
- You doing this deliberately?
You doing this deliberately?
- No. Stop it!

47:29.730 --> 47:32.820
- Stop it!
- You call that a fucking dig, huh?

47:32.900 --> 47:36.860
Do you call that a fucking dig?
Hit me harder. Hit me fucking harder!

47:36.950 --> 47:41.410
- Stop it. Calm down.
- For once in your fucking life,
hit me like a real father!

47:41.450 --> 47:44.240
Stop it.

47:48.120 --> 47:51.380
Just relax. Just relax!

47:53.420 --> 47:56.920
Just relax! Yeah?

47:57.010 --> 47:59.260
Come on, relax.

47:59.340 --> 48:01.220
That's right.

48:01.260 --> 48:05.060
Just relax. It's okay.

48:07.770 --> 48:11.770
- Da.
- It's not your fault, son, all right?

48:11.860 --> 48:14.690
Everything's going to be all right, son.

48:14.780 --> 48:17.570
It's okay. It's all right.

48:19.570 --> 48:23.080
Visitor for Conlon!

48:24.330 --> 48:26.750
Two on for visit!

48:34.920 --> 48:38.550
- No touching.
- Everybody else was allowed to touch.

48:38.630 --> 48:42.550
I.R.A., closed visits. No contact.

48:52.310 --> 48:54.440
Why are you doing this to us?

48:56.690 --> 49:01.160
- You have your father
locked in prison for murder.
- Speak up, please.

49:01.200 --> 49:06.200
- It's not my fault, Ma.
- Take it easy, Sarah.

49:09.500 --> 49:12.460
I swear to God, I've done nothing wrong.

49:12.540 --> 49:15.090
Why did you sign a confession, son?

49:15.170 --> 49:17.750
He did it to protect me, love.

49:17.840 --> 49:20.670
You have a good son there,
that's all you need to know.

49:20.760 --> 49:23.720
You didn't sign anything
yourself, did you, Guiseppe?

49:23.800 --> 49:26.810
The only thing I said
was I wanted to see you.

49:26.850 --> 49:30.560
Look, they've no statement,
nor evidence against me.

49:30.640 --> 49:34.900
I'll be out and home soon.
Sure, I'm only visiting here myself.

49:34.980 --> 49:38.570
I'll be able to help out
Gerry while I'm in here.

49:41.360 --> 49:43.280
Danny's dead, Gerry.

49:43.360 --> 49:45.660
What?

49:48.200 --> 49:51.160
They found his body on waste ground.

49:51.210 --> 49:55.170
The I.R.A. said he was an incurable thief.

49:57.170 --> 50:00.340
I sent a Mass card from the family.

50:03.680 --> 50:06.760
- Daddy.
- This one will not go to school
since you've been away.

50:06.850 --> 50:10.890
- Hey, you go to school for your mammy.
- Yes, Daddy.

50:10.970 --> 50:14.020
Daddy, when will you be home?

50:14.060 --> 50:19.270
I've pressed
your Sunday suits for the trial.

50:19.360 --> 50:22.530
Make sure and look your best now, son.

50:24.240 --> 50:27.660
But is there nitro or was there not nitro?

50:27.740 --> 50:30.790
Yes, there are... traces of nitro.

50:30.870 --> 50:33.160
But are they all positive?

50:33.250 --> 50:36.670
Well, yes, on six of them.

50:36.750 --> 50:40.590
- Who'd we miss?
- The aunt, Aggie... Annie.

50:40.670 --> 50:43.300
But her rubber glove showed a faint trace.

50:43.380 --> 50:46.260
And the children? The children?

50:46.300 --> 50:48.430
Positive.

50:48.510 --> 50:50.560
Oh, for...

50:50.640 --> 50:53.310
The results may not
be good enough for court.

50:53.390 --> 50:56.730
Your word will be
good enough for the court.

50:58.520 --> 51:00.480
Yes, sir.

51:04.440 --> 51:06.860
Kill the bastards! Kill them!

51:09.410 --> 51:12.740
- Kill them!
- Kill those bastards!

51:12.830 --> 51:16.080
Shoot the bastards!

51:28.640 --> 51:31.430
Call number one.

51:34.520 --> 51:37.020
- Let's go.
- Jesus, it's a nightmare, Guiseppe.

51:37.100 --> 51:41.360
Just stay calm, be on your best behavior
and they'll be behind us soon.

51:41.440 --> 51:43.650
That's it, come on.

51:43.730 --> 51:46.990
We'll be fine.

51:48.070 --> 51:50.660
Yes, we'll be all right.

51:59.750 --> 52:02.750
All... rise.

52:20.520 --> 52:24.980
Sir Michael Hagerty will present
the case on behalf of the Crown.

52:29.740 --> 52:33.330
There are... two series of
charges here, ladies and gentlemen.

52:33.370 --> 52:36.750
The four defendants in front...

52:36.830 --> 52:41.830
are charged with 11 counts in relation
to the explosion of the Guildford pub...

52:41.880 --> 52:44.130
and the murders of five people.

52:44.210 --> 52:48.260
The Crown will show
that these were the bombers.

52:48.340 --> 52:52.470
The seven defendants behind are charged
with the possession of explosives.

52:52.550 --> 52:56.600
They are not charged with murder.
The Crown's case against them is that...

52:56.680 --> 52:59.850
they are a support network
for the bombers, and as such...

52:59.940 --> 53:04.060
- should be considered totally independent.
- Control yourself.

53:04.150 --> 53:08.360
My first witness is inspector Robert Dixon.

53:08.440 --> 53:11.910
I swear by Almighty God that the evidence
I shall give shall be the truth,

53:11.990 --> 53:15.280
the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

53:17.330 --> 53:21.330
Inspector, why do you believe
these four are the bombers?

53:23.130 --> 53:27.840
First Hill, then Conlon,
Armstrong, Richardson...

53:27.920 --> 53:31.550
confessed to the bombing;
they are the I.R.A.'s A.S.U.

53:31.590 --> 53:34.300
Eh, can you explain A.S.U.s for us?

53:34.390 --> 53:36.850
"Active Service Unit."
The elite of the I.R.A.

53:36.930 --> 53:39.350
Those who carry out the
bombings and the shootings.

53:39.430 --> 53:43.310
Very often they are combat veterans with
previous experience with shooting...

53:43.400 --> 53:45.940
at soldiers... and planting explosives.

53:46.020 --> 53:48.650
And the others: Annie Maguire
and her family.

53:48.730 --> 53:54.110
They are the I.R.A.'s support network.
They store their families, friends.

53:54.160 --> 53:59.580
They store the weapons and explosives and
they provide what we call, "safe houses."

53:59.620 --> 54:01.870
Thank you, inspector.

54:01.960 --> 54:06.040
Inspector, these people
were arrested two days...

54:06.130 --> 54:09.090
after the Prevention
of Terrorism Act was introduced.

54:09.170 --> 54:11.050
That's correct.

54:11.130 --> 54:14.130
Can you explain, please, the powers
that this gives to the police?

54:14.220 --> 54:19.640
It permits us to hold suspected terrorists
for a period of up to seven days.

54:19.720 --> 54:21.810
Quite extraordinary powers in a democracy.

54:21.890 --> 54:24.810
Difficult I would've thought for
the police to resist the temptation...

54:24.850 --> 54:27.310
- to deal forcibly with people.
- Objection.

54:27.360 --> 54:30.940
People they suspect are the biggest
bombing campaign on the British mainland...

54:30.980 --> 54:34.110
- since the Second World War.
- Objection. My lord, I really must...

54:34.150 --> 54:37.660
- Get to the point!
- Now, this bombing campaign...

54:37.740 --> 54:41.540
struck deep into the British people's
sense of security.

54:41.620 --> 54:46.040
- The people looked to you
to find those responsible.
- Yes.

54:46.120 --> 54:48.920
You must have been under
the most intense pressure.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.050
That's my job.

54:51.130 --> 54:54.090
Now, all of the defendants claim,

54:54.170 --> 54:57.800
including young Patrick Maguire,
aged just 14.

54:57.850 --> 55:00.640
Patrick, would you stand up, please?

55:01.890 --> 55:04.350
Thank you. All of the defendants claim...

55:04.430 --> 55:08.480
that they were subjected to physical and
mental abuse while under police custody.

55:10.440 --> 55:12.780
They were never harmed in any way.

55:12.860 --> 55:16.530
- He's fucking lying!
They beat the shit out of us!
- Fucking liar!

55:16.610 --> 55:20.280
Silence. Sit them down!

55:20.370 --> 55:23.700
Please believe us! They beat us!

55:23.790 --> 55:25.830
Just be quiet.

55:25.910 --> 55:28.000
Sit them down!

55:28.080 --> 55:31.040
Silence in the court!

55:33.050 --> 55:35.220
Mr. Conlon says...

55:35.300 --> 55:38.760
that you pulled him by the hair
and squeezed his testicles.

55:38.840 --> 55:41.430
I never even spoke to Mr. Conlon.

55:41.510 --> 55:45.350
- I hope you burn in hell, Dixon.
- Silence!

55:45.390 --> 55:49.610
Mr. Hill says the police sat astride him
and put a gun in his mouth.

55:50.860 --> 55:53.280
There was no pressure of any kind.

55:53.360 --> 55:57.530
- You can go and fuck yourself,
you lying fucking bastard!
- Silence! Order!

55:57.610 --> 56:03.330
Inspector, in the case
of the four main defendants,
you have no corroborating evidence.

56:03.410 --> 56:06.750
I have the confessions of four obvious
terrorists. What more do you want?

56:06.830 --> 56:10.540
Well, n-nitroglycerin
is a highly toxic substance.

56:10.580 --> 56:12.590
It's when the substance to be tested...

56:12.630 --> 56:16.010
After a few weeks,
we were bored out of our minds.

56:16.090 --> 56:18.720
Just messed around and that there.

56:18.800 --> 56:22.140
They must have been desperate for evidence.

56:22.220 --> 56:25.770
They produced my Auntie Annie's washing-up
gloves like a rabbit out of a hat.

56:25.850 --> 56:28.810
And then it was my turn to take the stand.

56:28.890 --> 56:31.900
Mr. Conlon. Did you bomb Guildford?

56:31.940 --> 56:34.900
No, I didn't.

56:34.940 --> 56:38.490
The police claim that you were in
Guildford on the night of the bombing.

56:38.570 --> 56:40.740
Can you tell us where you were?

56:40.780 --> 56:43.410
- I was in a park in London.
- Who with?

56:43.450 --> 56:46.910
With Paul Hill sitting there.

56:46.950 --> 56:49.250
You met somebody else
that night, about 8 P.M.

56:49.290 --> 56:53.920
- Aye, I met a man called Charlie Burke.
- And who is he?

56:53.960 --> 56:58.260
Aye, he was just like a, you know, like a,
a fellow homeless guy we met in the park.

56:58.340 --> 57:01.590
Why do you remember this man so clearly?

57:01.640 --> 57:05.600
I remember thinking that if I
didn't get out of London fast,
I was going to end up like him.

57:05.640 --> 57:09.100
- You told this to the police?
- Aye.

57:09.180 --> 57:12.150
- What did they say?
- Aye, they said he didn't exist.

57:12.190 --> 57:16.650
Mr. Conlon, why did you confess
to the Guildford bombing?

57:16.690 --> 57:19.440
They beat me.

57:19.490 --> 57:22.780
And then they threatened to kill my father.

57:22.870 --> 57:27.620
- Will you repeat that please?
- They terrorized me for seven days.

57:27.660 --> 57:32.790
After that, they threatened to
kill my father; I'd have fucking
signed anything after that.

57:32.880 --> 57:36.380
- Excuse my language.
- Thank you.

57:38.710 --> 57:42.300
You expect this jury to believe that
decorated police officers...

57:42.380 --> 57:47.680
would risk their career and their
reputation by threatening your father?

57:47.760 --> 57:52.640
I don't expect them to believe
that by the time you finish with
them, but it happens to be truth.

57:52.690 --> 57:55.060
You're an honest man,
aren't you, Mr. Conlon?

57:55.150 --> 57:57.570
I like to think so.

57:57.650 --> 58:01.780
You've told us you remember
this Charlie Burke very well.

58:01.860 --> 58:04.320
Aye.

58:04.410 --> 58:08.370
Do you remember telling the police
anything else about that night?

58:08.410 --> 58:12.370
Let me refresh your memory.
You told inspector Dixon...

58:12.410 --> 58:15.130
that you had committed a robbery
on that night.

58:15.210 --> 58:18.250
Now do you remember?

58:19.340 --> 58:21.880
Aye.

58:21.970 --> 58:26.640
- Who did you rob?
- Robbed a hooker.

58:26.720 --> 58:30.350
- You robbed a prostitute?
- Aye.

58:30.390 --> 58:34.190
And we are expected to believe a man
who claims he stole from a prostitute...

58:34.230 --> 58:37.980
before we would believe
ten police officers who stood here,

58:38.070 --> 58:40.860
on oath, and called you a liar?

58:40.900 --> 58:43.530
That's the truth. You know, I'm...

58:43.610 --> 58:47.070
I'm bound to say I don't find
you very convincing.

58:47.120 --> 58:49.160
Thank you, Mr. Conlon.

58:53.250 --> 58:57.380
Why didn't you tell me that
you'd stole from that woman?

58:59.040 --> 59:02.460
You could have called me.
I would've sent the money.

59:08.220 --> 59:12.390
Are you going to be a thief
and a liar all your life?

59:13.850 --> 59:18.060
Standing up in that witness box.
Making faces to your mates.

59:30.410 --> 59:33.660
Well, at least you told the
truth in there. That'll stand you.

59:40.290 --> 59:43.510
Are you not going to eat that sausage?

59:43.590 --> 59:46.590
No.

59:46.630 --> 59:49.510
They put a gun in my mouth...

59:49.600 --> 59:53.770
and made me confess
to a murder I didn't commit.

59:53.810 --> 59:59.560
So I said I did the big bombing, and named
anybody I knew who was not in the I.R.A.

59:59.650 --> 1:00:02.110
Not in the I.R.A.?

1:00:02.150 --> 1:00:06.450
- Definitely not in the I.R.A.
- Why?

1:00:06.530 --> 1:00:10.240
You know why.

1:00:12.330 --> 1:00:15.620
I just wanted to show
how ridiculous it all was.

1:00:15.700 --> 1:00:19.630
Inspector, the defendant
Conlon presented an alibi.

1:00:19.670 --> 1:00:21.960
One Charlie Burke.

1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:25.550
Yes, that name did appear in Mr.
Conlon's statement. We investigated it.

1:00:25.630 --> 1:00:28.300
We couldn't find any trace
of such a person.

1:00:28.380 --> 1:00:30.840
And there was this question
of the robbery of a prostitute.

1:00:30.930 --> 1:00:34.140
No robberies were reported
in that area that night.

1:00:34.220 --> 1:00:37.480
At the start of this trial
I shook Gerry Conlon's hand.

1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:42.020
Subsequently, I was deeply shocked when a
member of the legal profession came to me...

1:00:42.110 --> 1:00:46.320
and asked me if I was now
going to wash my hand.

1:00:46.360 --> 1:00:50.990
In my long legal career, I cannot remember
a case where emotions have been so charged.

1:00:51.070 --> 1:00:54.030
It falls to me now to appeal to you,

1:00:54.080 --> 1:00:57.080
the members of the jury,
not to get caught up in this...

1:00:57.160 --> 1:00:59.670
tide of mass hysteria.

1:00:59.750 --> 1:01:04.550
Inspector Dixon admits there are scores
of inconsistencies in the confessions.

1:01:04.630 --> 1:01:08.340
My clients contend that
they were forced to confess...

1:01:08.420 --> 1:01:12.390
through brutality and intimidation.

1:01:12.470 --> 1:01:14.930
Now, they may be foolish...

1:01:15.010 --> 1:01:19.180
petty thieves, even drug abusers,

1:01:19.270 --> 1:01:24.610
but they are not the ruthless bombers
who have terrorized Britain for months.

1:01:25.980 --> 1:01:29.860
You should find
these young people... not guilty.

1:01:29.900 --> 1:01:33.200
- Bollocks!
- Okay, let's go.

1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:35.780
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Move it!

1:01:35.870 --> 1:01:38.700
- Move it!
- Hands off!

1:01:38.750 --> 1:01:40.710
Hands off!

1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.540
Ladies and gentlemen.

1:01:47.750 --> 1:01:50.800
Like my learned colleague in the defense,

1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:54.640
I would caution you not
to be swayed by your emotions.

1:01:54.720 --> 1:01:58.930
The four people you see in the front...

1:01:59.020 --> 1:02:03.020
are one of the most cunning and
cruel criminal conspiracies...

1:02:03.100 --> 1:02:05.900
ever to set foot on English soil.

1:02:05.980 --> 1:02:09.070
Now here are the facts of this case:

1:02:09.110 --> 1:02:11.610
Inspector Dixon,

1:02:11.650 --> 1:02:15.240
a decorated officer of great expertise,
acting on reliable information...

1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:19.910
and good detective work,
arrested Paul Hill,

1:02:19.950 --> 1:02:24.540
who, guilt-ridden by the shame
of his crime, confessed.

1:02:24.630 --> 1:02:28.500
That confession led the police
to the ringleader, Conlon...

1:02:28.590 --> 1:02:31.010
and his terrorist family.

1:02:31.090 --> 1:02:35.760
His aunt, Annie Maguire,
the experienced bomb maker...

1:02:35.840 --> 1:02:38.600
who wore rubber gloves
when handling explosives...

1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:41.270
in the kitchen of her home in Harlesden.

1:02:41.350 --> 1:02:44.440
She even allowed her children
to handle explosives.

1:02:44.520 --> 1:02:47.610
Vincent, aged 16. Patrick, 14,

1:02:47.650 --> 1:02:52.530
who did not...
could not know any better.

1:02:52.610 --> 1:02:58.280
Guiseppe Conlon, her brother-in-law, the
courier who arrived with more explosives.

1:02:58.370 --> 1:03:01.620
Armstrong and his dupe Richardson,
who carried the bomb.

1:03:01.660 --> 1:03:07.460
Now, these are the people who, in a panic,
had to dispose of the nitroglycerin.

1:03:07.540 --> 1:03:11.510
And that is what sealed their fate.

1:03:11.590 --> 1:03:16.010
How do we know this? Because
the truth was on their hands.

1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:24.480
It is a story written
in the blood of their victims.

1:03:24.520 --> 1:03:30.190
You have seen some of those who survived
their callous disregard for human life.

1:03:30.270 --> 1:03:34.820
It is now your duty
to protect society from them.

1:03:34.860 --> 1:03:39.740
I am confident that that is
what you will do.

1:04:14.900 --> 1:04:17.740
Have you reached a verdict?

1:04:17.820 --> 1:04:19.740
Yes, we have, my lord.

1:04:21.490 --> 1:04:25.290
- How do you find the defendants?
- Guilty as charged.

1:04:27.620 --> 1:04:31.710
Hang the Irish bastards!

1:04:31.750 --> 1:04:35.670
Order! Silence!

1:04:35.760 --> 1:04:39.340
String them up!

1:04:46.350 --> 1:04:49.060
Gerard Patrick Conlon.

1:04:49.140 --> 1:04:51.770
Stand up.

1:04:54.820 --> 1:04:58.650
I feel it is my duty to wonder aloud...

1:04:58.740 --> 1:05:03.370
why you were not charged
with treason to the Crown,

1:05:03.450 --> 1:05:07.540
a charge that carries a penalty
of death by hanging.

1:05:07.620 --> 1:05:11.210
A sentence I would have had
no difficulty in passing...

1:05:11.290 --> 1:05:14.090
in this case.

1:05:14.170 --> 1:05:17.210
I sentence you
I sentence you to life imprisonment...

1:05:18.760 --> 1:05:20.760
and I instruct that you shall serve...

1:05:20.840 --> 1:05:24.970
a minimum of 30 years.

1:05:25.060 --> 1:05:27.680
Take him down.

1:05:38.940 --> 1:05:41.450
Help me.

1:05:49.660 --> 1:05:52.960
Paul Michael Hill.

1:05:54.670 --> 1:05:58.800
In my view, your crime is such that life...

1:05:58.880 --> 1:06:01.180
shall mean life.

1:06:01.260 --> 1:06:05.680
Annie Maguire.
I recommend you serve 14 years!

1:06:05.760 --> 1:06:09.680
- What have I done, for Christ's sake?
- Take her down!

1:06:09.770 --> 1:06:12.560
- Guiseppe Conlon, 12 years.
- No, my husband's innocent!

1:06:12.640 --> 1:06:17.020
- Lord have mercy on you.
- Patrick Joseph Armstrong, 30 years.

1:06:22.990 --> 1:06:26.330
Carole Richardson, 30 years.

1:07:22.460 --> 1:07:26.720
Our case was so insane that if you made
it up, no one would believe it.

1:07:26.800 --> 1:07:30.140
Look, Gareth, I know people say that
I'm a compulsive storyteller,

1:07:30.220 --> 1:07:34.060
and nobody believed a word I said
in court, but Charlie Burke did exist.

1:07:34.100 --> 1:07:37.230
He's not just a figment of my imagination.

1:07:41.150 --> 1:07:43.320
Sorry.

1:07:54.500 --> 1:07:56.960
We were shipped off
to Park Royal Prison.

1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:01.340
An old Victorian fortress where Britain's
most dangerous criminals were held...

1:08:01.420 --> 1:08:03.920
in the maximum security wing.

1:08:04.010 --> 1:08:06.010
- Place of birth.
- Belfast.

1:08:06.090 --> 1:08:08.930
- Then you're British.
- This is your home
for the rest of your life.

1:08:09.010 --> 1:08:11.470
So accept it and get on with it.
Now come this way.

1:08:11.560 --> 1:08:16.270
The chief warder, Barker, gave us blue
denim uniforms with yellow stripes.

1:08:16.310 --> 1:08:21.360
We were Category "A", the highest security
class along with the rapists and murderers.

1:08:21.440 --> 1:08:26.070
My father said we'd fight for
an appeal, but I didn't want
to know about the legal system.

1:08:26.150 --> 1:08:28.450
I'm going back to the cell.

1:08:28.490 --> 1:08:31.660
Come on, follow me.

1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.800
Come on, Gerry.

1:08:43.880 --> 1:08:48.260
Hey, Ronnie. There's those
Irish bastards, Ronnie.

1:08:48.340 --> 1:08:50.550
Irish scum.

1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:55.770
My name's Guiseppe Conlon.
I'm an innocent man. So is my son.

1:08:55.850 --> 1:09:00.560
- We shouldn't even be in here.
- Get that fucking scum off my floor.

1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:06.240
I said knock it off!

1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:27.170
- They must know they've made a mistake.
- No they don't.

1:09:27.210 --> 1:09:30.880
The proof of our innocence
must be there in the evidence.

1:09:30.970 --> 1:09:34.260
We have to fight them to get an appeal.

1:09:34.350 --> 1:09:36.310
I'll speak to Father Wilson.

1:09:36.390 --> 1:09:41.440
Speak to everybody. We'll write letters
from in here. Start a campaign.

1:09:41.520 --> 1:09:45.770
- Have they been treating you all right?
- We're fine. Fine.

1:09:45.860 --> 1:09:48.030
Have they, son?

1:09:49.570 --> 1:09:51.700
Aye. No problem.

1:10:04.290 --> 1:10:07.750
Landing officers
on the two's for exercise.

1:10:09.260 --> 1:10:12.300
Forgot the dessert spoons.

1:10:12.380 --> 1:10:14.550
There you go.

1:10:21.690 --> 1:10:24.520
Mmm.

1:10:24.610 --> 1:10:27.230
These chips are not bad.

1:10:33.030 --> 1:10:35.320
Now don't you despair, son.

1:10:35.410 --> 1:10:38.620
- Never mind about "don't despair."
- What?

1:10:38.700 --> 1:10:42.960
I mean, we're innocent,
we can't even go out of the cell.

1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:47.920
You're better off being guilty.
At least you get some respect.

1:10:47.960 --> 1:10:51.420
Landing officers
on the three's for exercise.

1:10:51.510 --> 1:10:54.640
Here, you can have
my chips.

1:10:54.720 --> 1:10:58.100
Landing officers
on the three's for exercise.

1:11:36.550 --> 1:11:40.680
Gerry, man. Come. You all right?

1:11:43.520 --> 1:11:46.020
How you like your new home?

1:11:46.060 --> 1:11:48.810
Bombing of pillar box
Kensington High Street.

1:11:48.860 --> 1:11:52.440
Bombing of pillar box Talbot Lodge.
Bombing of naval club.

1:11:52.530 --> 1:11:56.910
Bombing of Aldershot Railway Station.
Attempted murder of Edward Heath.

1:11:56.990 --> 1:12:00.450
Murder of Ross McWhirter.
Possession of firearms,

1:12:00.530 --> 1:12:02.490
Balcombe Street, December 6, 1975.

1:12:02.580 --> 1:12:05.660
And the Guildford pub bombings.

1:12:05.710 --> 1:12:09.670
You have innocent people in jail for that.

1:12:12.590 --> 1:12:15.470
Take him out.

1:12:36.860 --> 1:12:39.320
He did it.

1:12:41.410 --> 1:12:44.290
Where's all the missing pieces?

1:12:46.410 --> 1:12:49.290
We eat it up, man.

1:12:49.370 --> 1:12:52.840
Before my woman sent it in here, right,

1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:55.630
she have it dipped in liquid acid.

1:12:55.710 --> 1:12:58.430
L.S.D., man.

1:12:58.510 --> 1:13:02.010
We've been dropping the British Empire
for the last six months.

1:13:02.100 --> 1:13:04.770
You want to fly? Pick a country.

1:13:04.850 --> 1:13:07.730
Fuck sake, don't give me Northern
Ireland. I don't want a bad trip.

1:13:07.770 --> 1:13:11.020
Try Nepal, man. Take you to the Himalayas.

1:13:26.700 --> 1:13:31.040
See the dragon.

1:13:56.610 --> 1:14:00.490
Lights out in 15 minutes, 15 minutes.

1:14:10.210 --> 1:14:13.460
Are you praying for the seventh cavalry?

1:14:13.540 --> 1:14:16.920
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:20.590
Blessed art thou amongst women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

1:14:20.670 --> 1:14:24.300
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for our sinners, now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.

1:14:24.390 --> 1:14:28.520
That's not funny, Gerry.

1:14:28.600 --> 1:14:33.310
Hail Mary... full of grace...
the Lord is with thee.

1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:39.780
Blessed art thou among women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

1:14:42.950 --> 1:14:47.950
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for our sinners, now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.

1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:51.000
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:54.830
Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit...

1:14:57.210 --> 1:15:00.210
Are you on drugs?

1:15:10.850 --> 1:15:15.350
Look, Da, I'll be older than you are
now when I get out of this place.

1:15:17.060 --> 1:15:20.230
If I get out.

1:15:21.190 --> 1:15:23.740
Are you listening to me?

1:15:23.820 --> 1:15:26.200
I'm not talking to you.

1:15:26.280 --> 1:15:29.540
Now who's being childish?

1:15:29.620 --> 1:15:33.870
I haven't had a sensible word
out of you for two weeks.

1:15:34.920 --> 1:15:37.000
That stuff will kill you.

1:15:38.420 --> 1:15:41.210
Sure, I'm dead anyway.

1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:50.470
Look, I'm sorry. I'll not take it
again so long as you live.

1:15:50.560 --> 1:15:54.270
Are you happy now?

1:15:54.350 --> 1:15:56.690
No.

1:15:56.770 --> 1:16:00.070
Why not?

1:16:00.110 --> 1:16:03.610
I don't want you to take it
whether I live or die.

1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:10.280
Jesus Christ.

1:16:14.500 --> 1:16:18.790
All right, I'll do nothing
to annoy you in your grave.

1:16:18.880 --> 1:16:21.670
Now are you happy?

1:16:21.750 --> 1:16:23.960
Is that a promise?

1:16:27.970 --> 1:16:30.600
Aye.

1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:33.060
Maybe.

1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:42.610
Gerry, man. Check out your friend.

1:16:44.820 --> 1:16:47.780
He look like the real thing.

1:16:49.360 --> 1:16:51.370
Come on.

1:17:04.550 --> 1:17:07.340
- Excuse me.
- All right.

1:17:10.220 --> 1:17:13.260
Let's have a talk.

1:17:15.560 --> 1:17:18.640
We have to eat in our cells.

1:17:18.730 --> 1:17:21.230
See ya later.

1:17:21.310 --> 1:17:24.780
Gerry. Gerry, come on.

1:17:50.220 --> 1:17:52.470
Morning, paddy.

1:17:57.390 --> 1:17:59.690
Yes!

1:18:06.400 --> 1:18:08.440
Come on!

1:18:08.530 --> 1:18:11.280
Yes, man, Gerry!

1:18:20.910 --> 1:18:25.590
This one, this one, this one,
14 days solitary! Lock up!

1:18:25.670 --> 1:18:30.800
- Lock up!
- He'll be all right.
He'll be back in a couple of days.

1:18:33.090 --> 1:18:36.720
- Christ!
- Come on. Come on.

1:18:40.640 --> 1:18:43.400
I'm worried about Bridie.

1:18:43.480 --> 1:18:46.440
Why?

1:18:48.110 --> 1:18:50.650
She's dyed her hair blond.

1:18:52.150 --> 1:18:55.030
Well, she's only young.

1:18:57.700 --> 1:19:00.200
She's wearing a dog collar.

1:19:07.250 --> 1:19:10.590
There's a fella chained to it;
he's got one on too.

1:19:14.220 --> 1:19:16.140
Well...

1:19:16.220 --> 1:19:18.680
as long as she's happy.

1:19:28.480 --> 1:19:31.280
Lunch break.

1:19:31.320 --> 1:19:34.030
Yes!

1:19:34.110 --> 1:19:38.410
Yes, Gerry, man. That's right,
Gerry's a bad boy!

1:19:38.490 --> 1:19:41.200
Put the Englishman
under heavy, heavy manners.

1:19:41.290 --> 1:19:45.540
Yes, sir. Go on, boy.
Kick out them clods, yes?

1:19:45.620 --> 1:19:50.710
- This is Joe McAndrew. He has
something important to tell you.
- Hello, Mr. Conlon.

1:19:53.920 --> 1:19:56.510
I'm watching you.

1:20:04.850 --> 1:20:08.940
What is it?

1:20:09.020 --> 1:20:12.990
I'm the one who planted
the Guildford bomb, Mr. Conlon.

1:20:15.530 --> 1:20:17.780
Did you tell the police that?

1:20:17.870 --> 1:20:20.870
Yes, I did.

1:20:20.950 --> 1:20:25.210
- But we haven't heard a thing.
- See what he has to say, Da.

1:20:25.290 --> 1:20:27.670
Go on.

1:20:27.710 --> 1:20:31.550
I told them. They know.
They know the truth.

1:20:31.630 --> 1:20:35.970
They can't afford to face it. It's a war.

1:20:36.050 --> 1:20:40.300
You're one of its innocent victims.
I'm sorry for your trouble.

1:20:40.390 --> 1:20:44.560
Don't be sorry for us. You should
be sorry for the people you killed.

1:20:46.480 --> 1:20:49.400
It was a military target. A soldier's pub.

1:20:49.480 --> 1:20:54.030
They were innocent people. God's children.

1:20:54.070 --> 1:20:58.660
Look, I'll do all I can...
to help you while you're in here.

1:20:58.740 --> 1:21:01.700
Well, we don't need your help.

1:21:01.740 --> 1:21:05.660
I'd appreciate it if you'd leave us alone.

1:21:05.750 --> 1:21:09.040
Whatever you say.

1:21:09.120 --> 1:21:12.040
I'll talk to him. Sorry about that.

1:21:14.550 --> 1:21:18.010
What was that all about?
You mind your fucking manners.

1:21:18.090 --> 1:21:22.640
What? Manners to him? I don't want
any part of him, or his ways.

1:21:22.720 --> 1:21:26.060
At least he fights back. Which is more
than you ever did in your life.

1:21:26.100 --> 1:21:28.600
- What are you talking about?
- Do you remember Lydon hill?

1:21:28.640 --> 1:21:31.610
You used to ride me up
on your bike up Lydon hill.

1:21:31.650 --> 1:21:36.030
And then one day you couldn't make it to
the top and I hopped off and looked back.

1:21:36.110 --> 1:21:39.400
Your face was all red. Remember that?

1:21:39.450 --> 1:21:41.620
Aye.

1:21:43.200 --> 1:21:46.700
- It was working in
the paint shed done that to you.
- What?

1:21:46.790 --> 1:21:50.460
It was the fumes from working
in the paint shed done that to ya.

1:21:50.540 --> 1:21:53.250
Never mind jumping off the
ferry, swimming back to Mammy.

1:21:53.290 --> 1:21:57.460
It was the one job a Catholic can get,
and you wouldn't even fight back then.

1:21:57.550 --> 1:22:01.640
Go on outside. Play with
your new-found friend.

1:22:01.720 --> 1:22:06.520
All I'm saying is that you've
been a victim. It's time
you started to fight back.

1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:08.980
- Get out of my sight.
- I'm going.

1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:14.730
This is the only way it'll work.
We have no alternatives.

1:22:31.040 --> 1:22:34.210
- Well, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

1:22:35.590 --> 1:22:38.300
- They didn't do it.
- They all did it.

1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:44.720
I'm going back to Belfast.

1:22:50.480 --> 1:22:54.480
After the fight, nobody stopped us
going to the yard to exercise.

1:22:54.560 --> 1:22:57.900
I felt brilliant.
Joe explained things to me;

1:22:57.980 --> 1:23:00.990
how the Brits never left
anywhere without a fight;

1:23:01.070 --> 1:23:04.450
how they had to be beaten out of
every country they ever occupied.

1:23:04.530 --> 1:23:07.990
How this prison was just
an extension of their system.

1:23:08.080 --> 1:23:10.200
Calling for work on three's.

1:23:10.290 --> 1:23:15.000
- We had to confront the chief
prison officer, Barker.
- Mr. Smalls.

1:23:15.040 --> 1:23:17.920
But to do that, we had to
take care of Ronnie Smalls.

1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.920
Can I have a word about 54 Halsey Road?

1:23:24.220 --> 1:23:26.550
Take a walk.

1:23:34.480 --> 1:23:38.320
If anything happens to me, or Gerry,

1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:41.150
or any other Irish prisoner,

1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:45.280
we'll have 54 Halsey Road
blown to smithereens...

1:23:45.360 --> 1:23:48.200
with your family in it.

1:23:48.240 --> 1:23:52.500
You threaten my family,
I'll cut your fucking head off.

1:23:55.080 --> 1:23:57.460
I don't make threats.

1:23:57.540 --> 1:24:01.960
I just carry out orders.
I don't want to hurt your family.

1:24:05.760 --> 1:24:10.100
Your trouble is, Joe, you want to
rule the fucking world.

1:24:11.470 --> 1:24:13.730
Paddy's all right.

1:24:23.530 --> 1:24:27.110
Soon, we were all one happy family.

1:24:27.200 --> 1:24:30.410
Again!

1:24:30.450 --> 1:24:33.370
- Even Kojak was ready to forgive.
- Live and let live.

1:24:33.450 --> 1:24:36.960
- Barker began to panic.
- Pay him a visit.

1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:40.500
Told us to take our socks out of
the window. He thought we were
signaling to other prisoners.

1:24:40.590 --> 1:24:43.840
We're not signaling.
We're drying our socks out.

1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:46.550
- Take the socks out. Mr. Barker.
- Who says?

1:24:46.630 --> 1:24:50.550
- That was all the excuse Joe needed.
- Give us two minutes.

1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:53.180
- Eh, up and away we went.
- Are you with me?

1:24:53.270 --> 1:24:57.730
What's he up to now?

1:24:57.810 --> 1:25:01.190
All prison officers to vacate the wing.

1:25:01.270 --> 1:25:04.860
All officers vacate the wing!

1:25:08.360 --> 1:25:11.410
Oh, they'll damage the whole campaign.

1:25:11.490 --> 1:25:15.330
- Look, you do it your way,
and we'll do it ours.
- You can read our demands.

1:25:15.410 --> 1:25:17.540
Go back to your cells.

1:25:17.620 --> 1:25:22.000
- Blankets!
- For God's sake, put a stop to this.

1:25:22.090 --> 1:25:25.130
- You're weakening my position.
- It'll end in violence.

1:25:25.210 --> 1:25:27.170
- Good.
- What's good about it?

1:25:27.260 --> 1:25:29.840
It's all they understand.

1:25:29.930 --> 1:25:32.300
Barker refused to negotiate.

1:25:32.350 --> 1:25:35.310
But with the screws gone,
we'd a brief taste of freedom.

1:25:35.350 --> 1:25:38.690
Check out Ronnie.

1:25:38.770 --> 1:25:41.020
Him swallow half Africa.

1:25:41.100 --> 1:25:43.520
I give him about an hour.

1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:52.780
We found out later our protest got on TV.

1:25:52.870 --> 1:25:55.330
And that's when
the riot squad was ordered in.

1:25:58.000 --> 1:25:59.960
Shhh.

1:26:01.670 --> 1:26:04.630
Shh. Shh.

1:26:10.300 --> 1:26:13.050
We were singled out as the ringleaders.

1:26:13.140 --> 1:26:15.140
Now!

1:26:26.650 --> 1:26:28.740
Oh, my god. Get me out!

1:26:31.070 --> 1:26:33.530
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1:26:39.250 --> 1:26:42.330
You just signed
your own death warrant, Barker.

1:26:46.750 --> 1:26:49.550
Are you happy now?

1:26:51.880 --> 1:26:54.850
And then you arrived, Gareth.

1:26:54.930 --> 1:26:59.310
That's the first time I saw you,
under a raining shower of sparks.

1:26:59.390 --> 1:27:03.060
It's the first time I'd seen a woman
in five years, other than my mother.

1:27:03.100 --> 1:27:06.690
But to me, you were a lawyer first.
And I hated lawyers.

1:27:06.770 --> 1:27:10.070
- Do you have a new isolation cell?
- Cartwright.

1:27:10.150 --> 1:27:14.950
Barth, Andrew. Bailey, Benjamin. McAndrew.

1:27:15.030 --> 1:27:17.780
Sorry. Can you... I can't hear.

1:27:17.870 --> 1:27:20.790
O'Brien, John.

1:27:20.870 --> 1:27:24.330
Lynch, Bernard. Crisp, Wesley.

1:27:24.420 --> 1:27:27.130
Lyon, Richard. Burns, David.

1:27:27.210 --> 1:27:31.130
What about Conlon? Sorry. Guiseppe Conlon.

1:27:31.220 --> 1:27:33.380
He's on the third floor.

1:27:33.470 --> 1:27:37.810
He has difficulty getting down the stairs.

1:27:37.890 --> 1:27:42.770
- Well, I'll just have to
go up and see him then.
- Delegation has seen enough.

1:27:42.850 --> 1:27:47.110
Rightio, sorry.
Well, I won't be a minute, so I'll
just... Sorry. I just want to...

1:27:47.150 --> 1:27:50.480
I won't be... I'll meet you
outside, okay. Sorry.

1:27:55.320 --> 1:27:58.330
Sorry, I can't...

1:27:58.410 --> 1:28:00.410
- Pulmonary thrombosis.
- Aha.

1:28:00.490 --> 1:28:03.410
- You're getting medica... He's getting
proper medication? Are you? Yes?
- Aye.

1:28:03.500 --> 1:28:06.630
Uh-huh.

1:28:06.710 --> 1:28:12.010
Ger... Son? Gerry?

1:28:12.090 --> 1:28:15.590
- That's... Is it Gerry? Uh-huh.
- That's Gerry.

1:28:15.680 --> 1:28:18.350
He's had a spot of bother
with lawyers in the past.

1:28:21.270 --> 1:28:24.850
He's all yours. Fifteen minutes.

1:28:24.940 --> 1:28:26.980
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

1:28:33.940 --> 1:28:35.820
You wanted to see me, Gerry?

1:28:56.970 --> 1:28:59.510
Why are you giving my father false hope?

1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:01.180
Sorry?

1:29:01.260 --> 1:29:04.180
He's been up and down these stairs
every couple of weeks to see you.

1:29:04.270 --> 1:29:06.190
He hasn't even seen
my mother in six months.

1:29:06.270 --> 1:29:09.310
Oh, I hear you're getting on
very well with her, by the way.

1:29:09.400 --> 1:29:11.690
Yes. She's a very brave woman.

1:29:11.730 --> 1:29:13.690
Aye, you don't know the half of it.

1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:18.160
The fucking stairs are killing him.

1:29:18.240 --> 1:29:20.990
It's not the stairs that
are killing your father.

1:29:21.070 --> 1:29:24.500
- What is it then?
- It's your lack of faith.

1:29:24.580 --> 1:29:27.250
Lack of faith? Faith in what?

1:29:27.330 --> 1:29:32.710
- In yourself.
- No... I have faith in myself.

1:29:32.750 --> 1:29:37.220
Gerry Conlon, lifer, 30-year sentence.

1:29:37.260 --> 1:29:40.050
And I know how to survive it, no problem.

1:29:40.090 --> 1:29:42.050
At what price?

1:29:42.100 --> 1:29:44.520
I'll pay the fucking price,
don't you worry about it.

1:29:44.600 --> 1:29:47.230
The price for what?

1:29:47.310 --> 1:29:52.230
Aye. You're very good
at the English, aren't you?

1:29:52.270 --> 1:29:56.570
You see, I don't understand your language.

1:29:56.610 --> 1:30:00.910
"Justice." "Mercy." "Clemency."

1:30:00.950 --> 1:30:04.580
I literally don't understand
what those words mean.

1:30:04.620 --> 1:30:08.080
I'd like to put in an application
to get all my teeth extracted.

1:30:08.120 --> 1:30:10.580
That way I could put my fist
in my mouth and never speak...

1:30:10.620 --> 1:30:12.710
another word of fucking English
so long as I live.

1:30:12.790 --> 1:30:14.800
Do you see what I'm saying?
Mrs. Peirce is it?

1:30:14.880 --> 1:30:17.460
Are you trying to impress me?

1:30:17.550 --> 1:30:20.760
Visit's up.

1:30:20.840 --> 1:30:24.260
Don't give my father false hope, all right?

1:30:24.300 --> 1:30:27.140
Gerry...

1:30:27.220 --> 1:30:29.270
You've got to help him!

1:30:31.310 --> 1:30:34.610
In prison, you pray for anything to
break the monotony.

1:30:34.650 --> 1:30:38.440
A snowstorm is like a present from God.

1:30:42.820 --> 1:30:44.780
Whoo!

1:30:46.950 --> 1:30:49.870
Hey! Prison officers are not to be hit!

1:30:49.960 --> 1:30:52.500
All right, you lot, you've asked for it.

1:30:52.580 --> 1:30:54.380
Come along!

1:30:54.460 --> 1:30:58.130
After the riot,
my father's health deteriorated badly.

1:30:58.170 --> 1:31:01.720
He couldn't make it down
the stairs to enjoy the snow.

1:31:01.800 --> 1:31:05.260
I waved up to him, but
he was looking at something else.

1:31:05.350 --> 1:31:07.640
All right, you lot!

1:31:14.610 --> 1:31:17.770
- My Da always saw the good in people.
- Yes.

1:31:17.860 --> 1:31:21.400
He recognized it in you
the minute he saw you, Gareth.

1:31:21.490 --> 1:31:25.780
Guv, guv, where you going?
Where's me letters? Guvnor!

1:31:29.330 --> 1:31:31.250
Thank you.

1:31:35.170 --> 1:31:38.090
I see you've been mentioned
in Congress, Guiseppe.

1:31:38.170 --> 1:31:40.090
What's that?

1:31:45.840 --> 1:31:47.810
How did you come by that name?

1:31:47.890 --> 1:31:51.430
I... An Italian ice cream maker.

1:31:51.520 --> 1:31:54.440
Had a shop on the corner
of the street where I was born.

1:31:54.520 --> 1:31:58.150
Guiseppe Fusco. My mother fell
in love with the name.

1:31:58.230 --> 1:32:01.070
Were they, um,

1:32:01.150 --> 1:32:04.150
- You know.
- What?

1:32:04.240 --> 1:32:07.320
- Lovers.
- Who?

1:32:07.410 --> 1:32:10.120
My mother and the Italian ice cream maker?

1:32:10.200 --> 1:32:16.040
Oh, no, God.
Oh, Jesus, no. No, they were not.

1:32:16.120 --> 1:32:18.170
No, she just liked the name.

1:32:18.250 --> 1:32:21.380
But it made my life hell.

1:32:21.460 --> 1:32:24.550
All the other children laughing at ya.

1:32:24.630 --> 1:32:28.470
You any kids yourself?

1:32:28.550 --> 1:32:31.470
He's talking to Barker now.

1:32:31.560 --> 1:32:34.890
Forget it, Joe. He can talk
to whoever he fucking likes.

1:32:36.480 --> 1:32:39.940
Two.

1:32:39.980 --> 1:32:42.730
Flown the nest now.

1:32:59.330 --> 1:33:01.550
Whether Barker was responsible or not...

1:33:01.630 --> 1:33:04.590
for bringing in the riot squad,
Joe never forgave him.

1:33:06.300 --> 1:33:08.390
Joe was still at war.

1:33:08.470 --> 1:33:11.220
And to him, Barker was the enemy.

1:33:12.810 --> 1:33:16.020
- Number?
- The name is McAndrew.

1:33:18.190 --> 1:33:20.230
Get out. Get out of the way.
Get out of the light!

1:33:20.310 --> 1:33:23.650
- You're 149.
- Get out of the light.

1:33:23.730 --> 1:33:27.110
- Number?
- Name's Gerry Conlon.

1:33:27.200 --> 1:33:29.740
Piss off out the light. Get out the light!

1:33:29.820 --> 1:33:31.620
You're 136.

1:33:37.330 --> 1:33:39.420
There's someone sitting there.

1:33:41.840 --> 1:33:43.750
Move when you're told.

1:33:50.180 --> 1:33:52.100
Put it out.

1:34:21.630 --> 1:34:24.210
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1:34:24.290 --> 1:34:27.170
You know, he looks more like you every day.

1:34:27.260 --> 1:34:29.880
He's smarter than I am.

1:34:29.970 --> 1:34:31.970
Three years old,
he can read the funny papers.

1:34:32.050 --> 1:34:34.010
There's a hair in the fucking projector!

1:34:34.100 --> 1:34:36.350
Yeah, get the fucking hair
out of the projector,

1:34:36.430 --> 1:34:38.520
- Will ya?
- Shh.

1:34:38.600 --> 1:34:41.480
- Come on, get it out! Get it out!
- Shh!

1:34:41.560 --> 1:34:43.560
I want you to arrange
to have a telephone man...

1:34:43.650 --> 1:34:45.570
- check out all the calls that
go in and out of here.
- We're going fucking blind, guv.

1:34:45.650 --> 1:34:50.070
- I did it already, Pop.
I took care of that.
- You know it could be anyone.

1:34:50.150 --> 1:34:52.740
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

1:34:52.820 --> 1:34:55.080
- We'll get there, Pop.
- Quiet.

1:34:55.160 --> 1:34:57.080
- I can't see a fucking thing.
- Shh.

1:34:57.160 --> 1:34:59.540
- You're blocking the shot.
- Shut it.

1:35:01.250 --> 1:35:03.630
Now, listen. Whoever comes to you...

1:35:03.710 --> 1:35:07.300
with this Barzini meeting...

1:35:10.010 --> 1:35:15.430
I knew that Santino was going to
have to go through all this.

1:35:15.510 --> 1:35:18.970
And Fredo, well...

1:35:19.060 --> 1:35:22.310
Fredo was wrong.

1:35:22.390 --> 1:35:27.360
And I never...
I never wanted this for you.

1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:30.240
For you!

1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:46.210
Get down, mate!
To the floor, mate! Get down!

1:35:54.680 --> 1:35:57.220
Come on, mate, get a
blanket! For God's sake, he's burning!

1:35:57.300 --> 1:36:00.640
Barker! Move back! Move back, Barker!

1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:03.690
Barker, move back! Get in there!
Get the hell in there!

1:36:03.770 --> 1:36:05.690
Get it out!

1:36:27.290 --> 1:36:29.710
- Stretcher!
- All right, let's turn his head around.

1:36:29.800 --> 1:36:31.880
All right, mate. You're with us.

1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:35.380
All right. Stretcher!

1:36:35.470 --> 1:36:38.890
Gently, mate. All right, up!

1:36:38.970 --> 1:36:42.390
- That was a good day's work, McAndrew.
- Come on, move it, men!

1:36:42.470 --> 1:36:46.230
- That was a good day's work.
- Get away from me.

1:36:46.310 --> 1:36:48.650
Will you not look me in the eye
when I'm speaking to you?

1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:54.990
I know how to look at people
without blinking as well.

1:36:58.660 --> 1:37:01.160
In all my godforsaken life,
I've never known...

1:37:01.240 --> 1:37:04.450
what it was like to want
to kill somebody until now.

1:37:06.750 --> 1:37:10.170
Ah, you're a brave man, Joe. A brave man.

1:37:12.670 --> 1:37:14.920
Gerard Conlon, back on the threes.

1:37:15.010 --> 1:37:18.640
- Stand your ground.
- Hawkins, returning to his cell.

1:37:18.720 --> 1:37:21.560
Benjamin Bailey, back to him cell!

1:37:21.640 --> 1:37:24.020
David Burns, returning to his cell.

1:37:24.100 --> 1:37:26.690
7445, Casey, back to his cell.

1:37:26.770 --> 1:37:29.310
6309, Johnston, level three.

1:37:29.400 --> 1:37:32.190
Regis, 113, going up to number two.

1:37:49.710 --> 1:37:52.290
- Back to your cell now!
- Keep moving.

1:37:52.380 --> 1:37:55.210
Barker was maimed for life,

1:37:55.300 --> 1:37:57.550
and Joe was sent to another prison.

1:37:57.630 --> 1:37:59.800
He's in solitary confinement somewhere.

1:37:59.890 --> 1:38:02.350
Blowing Whistle]
We've had no news of him since then.

1:38:02.430 --> 1:38:04.680
The new chief screw had the yard painted,

1:38:04.770 --> 1:38:06.730
and I was back walking in circles again.

1:38:06.770 --> 1:38:09.520
Back to the cells.

1:38:11.100 --> 1:38:13.400
Come on. Move.

1:38:40.970 --> 1:38:43.890
I'd like to help you out
with the campaign, Da.

1:38:45.140 --> 1:38:47.720
If that's all right with you.

1:38:47.810 --> 1:38:49.810
Do you mean it?

1:38:49.890 --> 1:38:54.940
- Aye.
- Oh, that's great.

1:38:55.020 --> 1:38:57.900
Okay, Gerry, what I need from you
is the whole story, your whole story.

1:38:57.990 --> 1:39:00.490
In as much detail as you can remember;
every detail you can think of.

1:39:00.570 --> 1:39:04.160
And I need you to write it down.
It's really important.

1:39:10.250 --> 1:39:14.170
I can't do this.

1:39:14.250 --> 1:39:16.250
I can't write this, Da.

1:39:16.340 --> 1:39:18.340
Could your son not give you a hand?

1:39:18.420 --> 1:39:23.050
- Nah, he's up in his cell writing away.
- Okay.

1:39:25.890 --> 1:39:27.810
Okay.

1:39:33.270 --> 1:39:38.980
Tape recorder.
You're a good talker. Talk.

1:39:39.070 --> 1:39:43.530
The strange thing is...

1:39:43.610 --> 1:39:45.870
The strange thing is sometimes
I think he's a little jealous...

1:39:45.950 --> 1:39:48.700
of me taking over the campaign
and that there.

1:39:48.790 --> 1:39:52.040
Going up and down the stairs
to meet you.

1:39:52.120 --> 1:39:57.880
I mean, that's something I never thought
about Guiseppe: that he could be jealous.

1:39:57.960 --> 1:40:02.880
Anyway, the main thing is
to get the case reopened...

1:40:02.970 --> 1:40:07.220
because I don't know how long
he can survive in here.

1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:24.990
I'm tired of this.

1:40:25.070 --> 1:40:29.030
Come on, we have to do this.
Come on. You behave yourself.

1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.540
Get your head down.

1:40:40.840 --> 1:40:44.760
When I was a wee lad, I used to wonder
what you were doing under the towel.

1:40:44.840 --> 1:40:48.260
Then one day when you and Ma were out,
I got a big bowl of boiling water,

1:40:48.350 --> 1:40:51.770
whacked a big drop of Vick
and then put the towel over my head.

1:40:51.850 --> 1:40:56.100
I sat there trying to figure out what it
was all about, and nothing was happening.

1:40:56.190 --> 1:40:58.270
And then I figured you
must have been drinking it.

1:40:58.360 --> 1:41:01.730
So I stuck my tongue in it.
Do you remember that?

1:41:01.780 --> 1:41:05.570
How could I forget?

1:41:05.610 --> 1:41:10.240
And your tongue...
swelled up like a football.

1:41:10.280 --> 1:41:12.330
Had to rush you to the hospital.

1:41:12.410 --> 1:41:14.580
First time you'd stopped
talking in your life.

1:41:17.500 --> 1:41:20.630
Give us that.

1:41:20.710 --> 1:41:23.210
I'll do your chest for you, Da.

1:41:30.300 --> 1:41:32.350
Was I always bad, was I?

1:41:32.430 --> 1:41:35.100
Not always.

1:41:35.180 --> 1:41:38.020
I don't deserve to spend
the rest of my life in here, do I?

1:41:38.100 --> 1:41:41.270
All they've done is block out the light.

1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:43.530
They can't block out the light in here.

1:41:43.610 --> 1:41:46.950
Listen, every night...

1:41:46.990 --> 1:41:49.280
I take your mother's hand in mine.

1:41:49.320 --> 1:41:52.780
We go out the front door,
into Cyprus Street,

1:41:52.830 --> 1:41:57.290
down the Falls Road, up the Antrim Road...

1:41:57.330 --> 1:42:00.670
to Cave Hill.

1:42:00.750 --> 1:42:03.880
We look back down...

1:42:03.960 --> 1:42:06.800
on poor, troubled Belfast.

1:42:10.300 --> 1:42:12.890
I've been doing that every night...

1:42:12.970 --> 1:42:15.930
for five years now.

1:42:15.970 --> 1:42:20.230
As if I never left your mother.

1:42:28.990 --> 1:42:31.570
What I remember most
about my childhood is...

1:42:31.660 --> 1:42:33.740
holding your hand.

1:42:33.830 --> 1:42:36.410
My wee hand in your big hand.

1:42:36.500 --> 1:42:38.910
And the smell of tobacco.
I remember that...

1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:42.250
I could smell the tobacco
off the palm of your hand.

1:42:45.340 --> 1:42:49.590
When I want to feel happy,
I try to remember the smell of tobacco.

1:42:52.850 --> 1:42:54.810
Hold my hand.

1:42:54.850 --> 1:42:57.600
Oh, Da, get the fuck...

1:42:57.680 --> 1:43:02.230
Now, don't go sentimental on me now.

1:43:02.310 --> 1:43:06.610
Don't be upset, Da. Look,
I'll hold your hand if you like.

1:43:06.690 --> 1:43:09.610
I'm going to die.

1:43:10.780 --> 1:43:12.740
Don't be saying that.

1:43:12.820 --> 1:43:15.120
I'm scared.

1:43:16.620 --> 1:43:20.000
You've no reason to be scared.
Nothing to be scared about.

1:43:20.040 --> 1:43:23.880
Don't you be comforting me when I can
see the truth staring me in the face.

1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:27.800
I'm scared I'm going to die
here... among strangers.

1:43:27.880 --> 1:43:30.880
- You're not fucking dying, all right?
- Can I not say a thing...

1:43:30.970 --> 1:43:34.470
without you fucking contradicting me?

1:43:34.550 --> 1:43:40.180
I'm scared to leave your mother... behind.

1:43:41.640 --> 1:43:45.560
Look, you are not going to die,
all right, Da?

1:43:47.150 --> 1:43:50.860
And even if you do, I'm sure
I can look after Ma all right.

1:43:50.900 --> 1:43:54.110
You think I'd leave Sarah in your care?

1:43:54.200 --> 1:43:57.410
What do you mean?

1:43:57.450 --> 1:44:01.370
You haven't the maturity to take
care of yourself, let alone your mother.

1:44:08.420 --> 1:44:10.880
I haven't much time between
appointments, Mrs. Peirce.

1:44:10.920 --> 1:44:13.220
- How can I help you?
- Thank you.

1:44:13.260 --> 1:44:16.890
Um, I'm the solicitor for
the Conlons, Chief Inspector.

1:44:16.930 --> 1:44:20.890
Guiseppe Conlon is critically ill,
as you may know.

1:44:20.930 --> 1:44:23.810
I've petitioned before the court
for his compassionate parole.

1:44:23.890 --> 1:44:26.060
They want your clearance.

1:44:26.100 --> 1:44:28.070
That'll be difficult, Mrs. Peirce.

1:44:28.110 --> 1:44:30.900
These people have committed
horrific crimes.

1:44:30.940 --> 1:44:33.820
Society demands that they serve their time.

1:44:33.900 --> 1:44:37.370
But they didn't do it, Chief Inspector.

1:44:37.450 --> 1:44:41.410
- Says who?
- Say the real bombers.

1:44:41.500 --> 1:44:44.080
They told you they did it, Mr. Dixon.

1:44:44.120 --> 1:44:46.750
Gerry Conlon told me
he did it, Mrs. Peirce.

1:44:46.830 --> 1:44:49.420
These people are liars.

1:44:49.500 --> 1:44:52.010
They're liars for a cause,
that's the worst kind.

1:44:52.090 --> 1:44:54.420
But he's dying. Guiseppe's dying.

1:44:54.510 --> 1:44:57.470
A lot of people are dying.
It's a dirty war.

1:45:01.970 --> 1:45:03.980
Well, I'll see what I can do.

1:45:04.060 --> 1:45:06.100
Is this your family, Mr. Dixon?

1:45:06.150 --> 1:45:09.270
That's my wife and my son.

1:45:09.310 --> 1:45:11.690
You have another appointment.

1:45:11.780 --> 1:45:14.530
Yes.

1:45:14.610 --> 1:45:17.700
I'll see you again, Mr. Dixon.

1:45:53.730 --> 1:45:56.030
Are you all right, Da?

1:46:02.700 --> 1:46:04.620
Da?

1:46:09.040 --> 1:46:11.340
Are you all right?

1:46:14.050 --> 1:46:16.300
Wake up, Da. Da?

1:46:16.380 --> 1:46:19.800
Da, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Guiseppe?

1:46:19.890 --> 1:46:22.970
Oh, fuck. Oh, come on, dear God
in heaven, don't do this to me.

1:46:23.060 --> 1:46:26.730
Come on, wake up.
Come on, wake up. Wake up, for fuck sake,
come on. Come on! Come on, wake up!

1:46:26.810 --> 1:46:28.980
Oh, dear God, thank you.
You're all right, Da.

1:46:29.060 --> 1:46:32.440
You're all right. You're all right,
Da. I'm going to get some help.

1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:37.320
Number 73! Number 73! Please come
quickly! My father's sick!

1:46:37.400 --> 1:46:39.360
Benbay, Guiseppe's taken bad!

1:46:39.450 --> 1:46:42.160
Da, Da, put your arms around me.
I'm getting you out of the bed.

1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:44.280
Come on, put your arms around me.
That's it. Come on.

1:46:44.370 --> 1:46:47.080
It's Conlon! Him not well at all!

1:46:47.160 --> 1:46:49.790
- Open the fucking door!
- Him number 73!

1:46:49.870 --> 1:46:52.670
- Open the fucking door!
- Guiseppe! Guiseppe!

1:46:52.750 --> 1:46:55.590
Fuck, he can't breathe.
He can't fucking breathe!

1:46:55.670 --> 1:46:59.840
He can't breathe! Look,
my father's fucking dying!

1:46:59.930 --> 1:47:02.890
- He needs oxygen!
- Give him a fucking break!

1:47:02.970 --> 1:47:06.890
Open the fucking gate! I'm right here, Da.

1:47:06.970 --> 1:47:09.270
- Get him in here!
- What the fuck is going on?

1:47:09.350 --> 1:47:14.060
Stay where you are! Stay where you are.

1:47:14.110 --> 1:47:16.400
Hammersmith Hospital now.

1:47:16.440 --> 1:47:18.240
I want to go with him.
Can I go with him, boss?

1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:22.570
I've got to get clearance first.
It's out of my hands.

1:47:22.610 --> 1:47:25.490
You're going to be all right, Da!
I'll be with you...

1:47:25.580 --> 1:47:28.000
- as soon as I can.
- Take him back to his cell.

1:47:33.710 --> 1:47:37.960
Leave him alone,
you bastards! Just let him be!

1:47:38.050 --> 1:47:41.130
Stay strong, Gerry! Stay strong, mate!

1:47:41.220 --> 1:47:43.760
Keep your chin up, mate!

1:47:43.840 --> 1:47:46.970
- We're with you, Gerry!
- Yeah, we're with you all the way, mate!

1:47:59.400 --> 1:48:01.780
He's still awake.

1:48:16.340 --> 1:48:18.920
Your father passed away an hour ago.

1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:22.300
Thank you very much.

1:48:23.630 --> 1:48:25.890
I'm sorry.

1:48:57.540 --> 1:48:59.550
Guiseppe is dead, man!

1:48:59.630 --> 1:49:02.550
They kill Guiseppe!

1:49:07.680 --> 1:49:09.720
Gerry, man!

1:49:12.520 --> 1:49:14.770
Gerry!

1:49:14.850 --> 1:49:17.600
They kill Guiseppe!

1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:08.280
Well, I think they ought to take
the word "compassion"...

1:50:08.360 --> 1:50:12.280
out of the English dictionary.

1:50:12.370 --> 1:50:16.000
They fouled the ball, Gareth.

1:50:18.080 --> 1:50:21.960
They fouled the fucking ball,
and they're as guilty as sin.

1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:27.340
Believe me, if there's one thing
I know about, it's guilt, you know?

1:50:27.420 --> 1:50:30.840
Keep looking them in the eye,
and it's going to reveal itself.

1:50:30.930 --> 1:50:36.310
You have to keep up the pressure.

1:50:36.390 --> 1:50:38.640
Do what you have to do.

1:50:40.440 --> 1:50:44.360
Free the Four! Free the
Four! Free the Four! Free the Four!

1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:46.360
Free the Four!
Free the Four!

1:51:01.880 --> 1:51:04.840
Those were meant to be here
three weeks ago.

1:51:08.220 --> 1:51:11.640
"The Parade of innocence."
What do you think?

1:51:11.680 --> 1:51:13.640
Thousand of people
lined the streets of Dublin,

1:51:13.680 --> 1:51:15.810
London and Liverpool today
in demonstrations...

1:51:15.850 --> 1:51:17.850
demanding the release
of the Guildford Four.

1:51:17.930 --> 1:51:21.020
- Questions have been raised
in the House of Commons...
- Say good night to Daddy.

1:51:21.100 --> 1:51:23.650
- regarding the safety...
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, son.

1:51:23.690 --> 1:51:26.530
Free the Four! Free the Four!
Free the Four!

1:51:26.610 --> 1:51:28.610
Free the Four!
Free the Four!

1:51:28.690 --> 1:51:31.160
Mr. Dixon! Excuse me.
Mr. Dixon!

1:51:38.410 --> 1:51:41.370
This was a mistake.

1:51:41.460 --> 1:51:43.710
Why don't we let her see the files?

1:51:43.750 --> 1:51:46.170
What harm could it do?

1:51:46.250 --> 1:51:48.840
Mr. Dixon!

1:51:48.880 --> 1:51:50.880
Don't you ever get tired
of this sort of thing? What's that?

1:51:50.920 --> 1:51:53.640
This is a court order that I be allowed
to see the Guiseppe Conlon case files.

1:51:57.600 --> 1:52:00.230
- Good morning.
- There are a few rules to be observed.

1:52:01.730 --> 1:52:04.310
Here's a complete list
of the Conlon, Guiseppe case files;

1:52:04.400 --> 1:52:06.320
the only files you'll need to see.

1:52:06.400 --> 1:52:08.570
I'll go to the file drawer
and bring it out.

1:52:08.650 --> 1:52:11.820
You open it in front of me, take a page
at a time, read it and then return it.

1:52:11.900 --> 1:52:14.320
Sorry. Is there a problem, Mr. Dixon?

1:52:14.410 --> 1:52:16.330
Problem? Not at all, Mrs. Peirce.

1:52:16.410 --> 1:52:19.750
Our chief archivist,
Mr. Jenkins, is here to assist you.

1:52:19.830 --> 1:52:23.000
If you want to make a photocopy,
I, and I alone, will do it.

1:52:23.080 --> 1:52:26.130
- And you use this pen
at all times for any notes.
- Why?

1:52:26.210 --> 1:52:29.760
If you deface or alter any
document, we'll be able to trace
it through the ink in this pen.

1:52:29.840 --> 1:52:34.470
There are national security issues
involved here, Mrs. Peirce.

1:52:34.550 --> 1:52:39.810
We wouldn't want police intelligence files
leaked to the I.R.A. now, would we?

1:52:41.270 --> 1:52:46.230
- Conlon, Guiseppe file.
- Yes, sir.

1:52:58.950 --> 1:53:01.620
Might as well leave my kit on the bus,
'cause I'm not staying in your jail.

1:53:01.700 --> 1:53:05.420
So, our new V.I.P. prisoner.

1:53:05.460 --> 1:53:08.960
- Welcome to Scotland.
- I'm an innocent man.
My father was an innocent man.

1:53:09.040 --> 1:53:13.340
He died in one of your jails.
There's nothing you can do to hurt me.

1:53:13.420 --> 1:53:15.630
- They've moved me to a Scottish
jail to break up my confidence.
- Put him in solitary.

1:53:15.720 --> 1:53:18.800
This is a peaceful protest.
I'm not observing prison rules.

1:53:18.890 --> 1:53:22.310
- We'll teach you manners.
- Better men than you have tried that already.

1:53:22.350 --> 1:53:24.810
Your Honor, I have not seen
my client for two months.

1:53:24.890 --> 1:53:30.150
He's been moved to Scotland,
which has seriously impeded
my investigation into his case.

1:53:30.230 --> 1:53:32.440
So I'm filing this motion
to gain proper access...

1:53:32.480 --> 1:53:35.530
Free the Four!
Free the Four! Free the Four!

1:53:49.920 --> 1:53:53.340
Here, thanks a lot then. Good day.
Oh, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks.

1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:12.320
Sorry.

1:54:12.360 --> 1:54:14.360
Could you copy that for me, please?

1:54:14.440 --> 1:54:17.490
Thank you.

1:54:26.910 --> 1:54:31.170
I just want my mother to be happy.

1:54:31.210 --> 1:54:34.340
Uhh, I'd like her
to know that...

1:54:34.380 --> 1:54:40.180
Guiseppe talked about her
every day of his life.

1:54:40.220 --> 1:54:43.850
He missed her terribly.

1:54:47.390 --> 1:54:51.360
It's strange to be in a cell
without him.

1:54:53.070 --> 1:54:55.690
I can't seem to get his face
out of my mind.

1:54:55.730 --> 1:54:58.700
Everywhere I look, I see him.

1:55:04.870 --> 1:55:10.620
Strange what time does
when you're in prison.

1:55:10.710 --> 1:55:15.300
Like, you can be staring at the wall.

1:55:15.380 --> 1:55:19.630
Drip, drip, drip.

1:55:19.720 --> 1:55:21.640
It takes an eternity.

1:55:21.720 --> 1:55:25.640
And then you blink
and three years have gone by.

1:55:29.890 --> 1:55:31.980
I mean, what I'm trying to...

1:55:32.060 --> 1:55:36.780
I don't know what the fuck
I'm trying to say.

1:55:36.860 --> 1:55:42.160
But I can't forget
what they did to my family.

1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:44.990
I just can't forget.

1:56:16.440 --> 1:56:21.150
Gerry! Gerry! Gerry!

1:56:21.240 --> 1:56:25.280
Gerry, come on, take it easy.

1:56:30.370 --> 1:56:32.460
Hang on, Gerry.

1:56:32.710 --> 1:56:35.290
Morning.

1:56:35.380 --> 1:56:38.170
- Where's Jenkins?
- He telephoned in sick.

1:56:38.210 --> 1:56:40.510
I'm afraid you're going to
have to come back tomorrow.

1:56:40.550 --> 1:56:43.340
No, no, I can't. I'm in court tomorrow.
There's too much to get through.

1:56:43.380 --> 1:56:46.850
- I can't help you.
- Please, look, I've got a court order.

1:56:46.890 --> 1:56:49.350
You saw what Mr. Jenkins did.
He just brings me the files.

1:56:49.390 --> 1:56:51.890
I take the notes and give them
straight back to you. Please.

1:56:51.980 --> 1:56:54.690
- What name is it?
- Conlon.

1:56:54.730 --> 1:56:57.860
- All right.
- Thanks. Thank you very much. Cheers.

1:57:03.740 --> 1:57:07.280
- What name was that again?
- Conlon.

1:57:07.370 --> 1:57:13.160
We've got two Conlon boxes.
Is it Guiseppe Conlon or Gerard Conlon?

1:57:15.210 --> 1:57:17.880
Gerard.

1:57:23.880 --> 1:57:26.090
Well, that's for starters.

1:57:48.410 --> 1:57:50.910
Fuck them! Fuck them!

1:57:50.990 --> 1:57:53.580
It's good news, Gerry.

1:57:53.660 --> 1:57:57.830
We're talking about a piece of evidence...

1:57:57.920 --> 1:58:01.590
that says they knew all along
that they let my father die in prison?

1:58:01.670 --> 1:58:04.590
Would you mind telling me
what's good about that, Gareth?

1:58:04.630 --> 1:58:06.590
We'll get them in court.

1:58:06.630 --> 1:58:09.600
"We'll get them in court"? For fuck
sake, will you catch yourself on?

1:58:09.680 --> 1:58:12.600
They've kept us in prison for 15 years.
They can keep us in for another 15.

1:58:12.680 --> 1:58:14.640
It's the fucking government, Gareth!

1:58:14.730 --> 1:58:17.730
It's the fucking government!
What are they going to say?

1:58:17.810 --> 1:58:20.770
"We're sorry about that."

1:58:20.860 --> 1:58:24.280
"Made a wee bit of a mistake there,
but you can be on your way now."

1:58:24.360 --> 1:58:26.450
What are they going to say?
"Sorry we killed your Da."

1:58:26.530 --> 1:58:30.740
"Sorry we fucked your fucking life
to hell." What are they going to say?

1:58:33.950 --> 1:58:36.960
Gerry.

1:58:46.880 --> 1:58:49.800
I am not putting my mother
through hell again.

1:58:49.840 --> 1:58:52.640
Are you afraid of court?

1:58:52.680 --> 1:58:55.020
Look, I just don't
want to be humiliated again.

1:59:15.490 --> 1:59:18.960
I swear by Almighty God,
that the evidence I shall give...

1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:21.290
shall be the truth, the whole truth...

1:59:21.330 --> 1:59:23.290
and nothing but the truth.

1:59:30.010 --> 1:59:34.640
Mr. Dixon, do you know
these young people...

1:59:34.720 --> 1:59:38.520
known as the Guildford Four?

1:59:38.560 --> 1:59:41.150
Yes, I do.

1:59:41.190 --> 1:59:44.310
Do you know how long
they have spent in jail?

1:59:44.360 --> 1:59:48.610
Fifteen years, I believe.

1:59:48.690 --> 1:59:51.280
Do you know Annie Maguire...

1:59:51.360 --> 1:59:55.530
who served her 14 years without remission?

1:59:55.580 --> 1:59:59.370
Do you know her son Vincent
who served five years?

1:59:59.450 --> 2:00:02.210
Do you know her son Patrick who served
four? Do you know her husband...

2:00:02.290 --> 2:00:06.250
Paddy Maguire who served 12 years?

2:00:06.340 --> 2:00:11.050
Carole Richardson was 17
when she went to jail, Mr. Dixon.

2:00:11.090 --> 2:00:13.930
Now she is 32.

2:00:14.010 --> 2:00:16.010
Do you know Carole Richardson?

2:00:16.050 --> 2:00:20.350
- My Lord, what is the point of this?
- Yes, come to the point.

2:00:26.690 --> 2:00:29.940
Do you know who this is, Mr. Dixon?

2:00:33.910 --> 2:00:35.740
No, I don't.

2:00:35.780 --> 2:00:41.040
Well, then would you be so kind
as to read the statement that you...

2:00:41.080 --> 2:00:44.080
- took from him on the third
of November, 1974?
- Let's see this statement.

2:00:44.170 --> 2:00:47.960
A statement, My Lord, which
vindicates all of these people,

2:00:48.050 --> 2:00:50.920
- all these innocent people.
- My Lord, I need to see
a copy of this statement.

2:00:50.960 --> 2:00:54.550
Someone, either that man or
his superior or his Superior's superior,

2:00:54.590 --> 2:00:57.760
ordered that these people
be used as scapegoats...

2:00:57.850 --> 2:01:00.100
- by a nation that was baying for blood...
- Mrs. Peirce!

2:01:00.180 --> 2:01:02.140
- My Lord!
- in return for the innocent blood...

2:01:02.230 --> 2:01:03.890
- spilled on the streets of Guildford!
- Stop her!

2:01:03.940 --> 2:01:06.940
- And, by God, you got your blood, Mr. Dixon!
- This is a political speech!

2:01:07.020 --> 2:01:11.650
- You got the blood of Guiseppe
Conlon and Carole Richardson!
- This is outrageous!

2:01:11.740 --> 2:01:13.820
- You got 15 years of blood and
sweat and pain from my client...
- Mrs. Peirce, be silent!

2:01:13.900 --> 2:01:16.990
- whose only crime was that
he was bloody well Irish,
- Silence in court!

2:01:17.070 --> 2:01:19.490
and he was foolish, and he was in
the wrong place at the wrong time!

2:01:19.580 --> 2:01:23.910
Mrs. Peirce, I will have you
removed from the court.

2:01:28.710 --> 2:01:31.300
And one of your colleagues, My Lord,

2:01:31.380 --> 2:01:34.470
who sat where you sit now said,
and I quote, "It is a pity...

2:01:34.550 --> 2:01:36.680
"you were not charged
with treason to the Crown,

2:01:36.760 --> 2:01:40.810
"a charge that carries a penalty
of death by hanging,

2:01:40.890 --> 2:01:44.140
a sentence I would have no difficulty
in passing in this case."

2:01:44.230 --> 2:01:47.150
Mrs. Peirce, I'm trying
to read this document.

2:01:47.230 --> 2:01:50.520
I will not tell you again to be silent,

2:01:50.610 --> 2:01:54.030
or you will be removed from the court.

2:02:35.740 --> 2:02:41.580
My Lord, this document brings the entire
British legal system into disrepute.

2:02:41.660 --> 2:02:44.240
My Lord, this is new evidence.

2:02:44.330 --> 2:02:46.330
It is shocking new evidence.

2:02:46.410 --> 2:02:51.340
My Lord, this evidence was not submitted
at the trial that is under appeal.

2:02:51.380 --> 2:02:55.050
That, I believe, is the point
Mrs. Peirce is trying to make.

2:02:55.130 --> 2:02:57.880
- Proceed, Mrs. Peirce.
- My Lord, I demand a recess.

2:02:57.970 --> 2:03:01.930
There will be no demands made in my court.

2:03:02.010 --> 2:03:04.520
Stand back.

2:03:06.560 --> 2:03:10.650
My Lord, this alibi for Gerry Conlon...

2:03:10.730 --> 2:03:15.650
was taken by Mr. Dixon one month
after Gerry Conlon was arrested.

2:03:15.730 --> 2:03:19.990
This note was attached to it
when I found it in police files.

2:03:20.070 --> 2:03:23.450
It reads, "Not to be shown
to the defence."

2:03:29.410 --> 2:03:32.580
I have one question
to ask you, Mr. Dixon.

2:03:32.630 --> 2:03:34.840
Why was the alibi for Gerry Conlon,

2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:38.670
who was charged with the murder
of five innocent people,

2:03:38.760 --> 2:03:41.220
kept from the defense?

2:03:48.930 --> 2:03:50.940
- Give us an answer!
- Answer the question!

2:03:51.020 --> 2:03:54.360
- Silence!
- It's about time!

2:03:54.440 --> 2:03:56.940
Order in the court!

2:03:57.030 --> 2:04:01.280
My Lord, I would like
to approach the bench.

2:04:01.360 --> 2:04:05.490
- This is most irregular.
- Yes, I'm aware of that.

2:04:05.580 --> 2:04:08.250
Very well.

2:04:23.720 --> 2:04:27.760
- Mr. Dixon, you may stand down.
- No, no, no, My Lord!

2:04:27.810 --> 2:04:31.140
My Lord, this is the man
who should be under arrest!

2:04:31.230 --> 2:04:33.440
Be silent, Mrs. Peirce.

2:04:33.480 --> 2:04:35.810
- This court is now in recess.
- Guards, get ready.

2:04:35.900 --> 2:04:41.320
Look, don't try and make me the fall guy
for the whole British legal establishment.

2:04:45.410 --> 2:04:49.160
If I accept this mercy deal...
They have a flipping cheek...

2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:51.500
offering me mercy. They should
be begging for mercy themselves.

2:04:51.580 --> 2:04:55.000
- You ready, Mr. Conlon?
- Aye. I know the difference
between right and wrong.

2:04:55.080 --> 2:04:58.090
- I know.
- The truth has to come out.
They may not want to hear it,

2:04:58.170 --> 2:05:00.170
- but there's people outside who'll listen.
- I know, son.

2:05:00.260 --> 2:05:02.800
- Just think about it, will you?
Just think about it.
- All right.

2:05:02.840 --> 2:05:04.890
Aye, give us three of those.

2:05:20.650 --> 2:05:23.200
Silence!

2:05:24.860 --> 2:05:30.370
In the matter of Her Majesty
versus Gerard Patrick Conlon,

2:05:30.450 --> 2:05:33.370
the case is hereby dismissed.

2:05:37.960 --> 2:05:40.340
- My husband died in your prison
an innocent man!
- Come on, Ma!

2:05:40.380 --> 2:05:42.340
- I'm going out the front door.
I'll see you outside.
- Come on, Mr. Conlon.

2:05:42.380 --> 2:05:44.840
- I'll see you outside.
- Come on, sir. This way. Let's go.

2:05:44.880 --> 2:05:47.220
- I'm going out the front door.
- What about Guiseppe Conlon?

2:05:47.260 --> 2:05:50.850
Your Honor, he was an innocent man!

2:05:50.890 --> 2:05:52.850
Come this way, sir.

2:05:52.890 --> 2:05:56.480
- Mr. Conlon, sir, that's not a good idea.
- Use the back, for security reasons.

2:05:56.560 --> 2:05:58.610
I'm a free man, and I'm
going out the front door.

2:05:58.690 --> 2:06:01.900
- Get back!
- In the matter of Her Majesty...

2:06:01.980 --> 2:06:06.910
versus Paul Hill,
the case is hereby dismissed.

2:06:13.700 --> 2:06:17.880
Leave me alone! I'm going
out the front door with Gerry!

2:06:20.210 --> 2:06:25.220
In the matter of Her Majesty
versus Patrick Armstrong,

2:06:25.300 --> 2:06:29.390
the case is hereby dismissed.

2:06:29.430 --> 2:06:34.140
In the matter of Her Majesty
versus Carole Richardson,

2:06:34.220 --> 2:06:37.600
the case is hereby dismissed.

2:06:37.690 --> 2:06:43.150
I'm an innocent man! I spent 15 years
in prison for something I didn't do!

2:06:43.230 --> 2:06:48.070
I watched my father die in a British
prison for something he didn't do!

2:06:48.110 --> 2:06:51.120
And this government still says he's guilty!

2:06:51.160 --> 2:06:56.120
I want to tell them that until
my father is proved innocent,

2:06:56.210 --> 2:07:00.290
until all the people involved
in this case are proved innocent,

2:07:00.380 --> 2:07:02.840
until the guilty ones
are brought to justice,

2:07:02.920 --> 2:07:05.800
I will fight on!

2:07:05.840 --> 2:07:08.760
In the name of my father and of the truth!
