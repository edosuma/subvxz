00:21.510 --> 00:25.420
And women down below, Mr. Devil and I

00:25.470 --> 00:26.723
am gonna put on some show.

00:28.640 --> 00:31.470
♪ If what you say is the positive truth ♪

00:31.520 --> 00:33.213
To our new friend, welcome.

00:34.620 --> 00:35.793
This is your souvenir.

00:44.430 --> 00:45.303
Yesterday.

01:02.767 --> 01:04.228
I don't want it.

01:04.278 --> 01:06.105
This is like the last person...

01:09.387 --> 01:11.056
I wanna be...

01:20.940 --> 01:21.910
Hello.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.790
My name is Antigone Corday.

01:24.840 --> 01:28.930
I am Jeremiah Corday's sister.

01:28.980 --> 01:32.620
And I have some very upsetting news.

01:32.670 --> 01:36.700
Yesterday, my brother Jeremiah died.

01:36.750 --> 01:40.293
He was my best friend.

01:41.370 --> 01:42.963
He taught me everything.

01:48.480 --> 01:52.000
My heart is broken, but
I can't just sit here and

01:52.920 --> 01:54.280
waste away and do nothing.

01:54.330 --> 01:56.260
Jeremiah would kill me.

01:56.310 --> 01:59.650
As much as he meant to me,

01:59.700 --> 02:01.683
he meant even more to you.

02:02.700 --> 02:05.375
And the causes he fought for.

02:06.450 --> 02:10.330
He gave important ideas a global platform.

02:10.380 --> 02:14.770
So in order to keep his legacy alive,

02:14.820 --> 02:17.830
I'm going to continue
uploading to his channel.

02:17.880 --> 02:21.040
His causes are mine
and his spirit is mine now.

02:21.090 --> 02:24.970
Jeremiah always used
to say we'll never end evil

02:25.020 --> 02:27.070
and will never end oppression.

02:27.120 --> 02:31.300
But what remains and
what rises into the ether

02:31.350 --> 02:34.113
and becomes immortal, in his words,

02:35.520 --> 02:39.100
is the way in which we bring light

02:39.150 --> 02:41.620
and goodness into this world.

02:41.670 --> 02:44.410
The impact is really real, y'all.

02:44.460 --> 02:45.910
The impact is there.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.063
And so that's what I'm doing.

02:49.020 --> 02:50.770
Or at least that's what
I'm gonna try to do,

02:50.820 --> 02:53.200
because that's what Jeremiah was about.

02:53.250 --> 02:56.530
And that is the most admirable thing

02:56.580 --> 03:01.030
that I can take with me through my life

03:01.080 --> 03:02.373
and teach my kid.

03:03.330 --> 03:04.690
But you know what, I thought,

03:04.740 --> 03:07.840
like, what can I bring to his legacy

03:07.890 --> 03:10.983
that would make him maybe even more human?

03:13.440 --> 03:15.610
So I found this.

03:15.660 --> 03:19.759
It's a never before
seen clip, an exclusive.

03:21.990 --> 03:24.903
It's from Jeremiah's last birthday.

03:26.642 --> 03:30.648
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

03:30.698 --> 03:34.696
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

03:34.746 --> 03:38.663

Can I make a wish?

03:53.640 --> 03:55.180
Okay, I wish for world peace.

03:55.230 --> 03:57.350
Oh my god,
Jeremiah you can't say it.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.630
Okay, I can't say it.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.850
I'll make another wish,
I'll make another wish.

04:00.900 --> 04:01.807
Thank you.

04:02.841 --> 04:03.858
No, no, no.

04:03.900 --> 04:04.691
No, not yet dad.

04:04.733 --> 04:06.760
Okay, we're gonna eat it soon.

04:06.810 --> 04:07.625
Jeremiah's gonna cut it, - I'll cut it.

04:07.667 --> 04:08.950
'Cause it's his-

04:09.000 --> 04:11.494
You want a big piece
or a small piece, dad?

04:11.544 --> 04:12.335
A big piece.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.160
Okay.

04:13.210 --> 04:14.470
Don't give him too big.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.053
Let's use our fork, dad.

04:18.090 --> 04:18.873
Take that, look.

04:18.923 --> 04:20.780
Can you
actually also wipe his face?

04:20.830 --> 04:22.030
I am, I am.

04:22.080 --> 04:24.070
He's actually not doing too, too bad.

04:24.120 --> 04:24.903
Use your fork.

04:24.953 --> 04:26.153
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's good.

04:27.673 --> 04:29.140
So,

04:29.190 --> 04:30.640
what does the future hold in store

04:30.690 --> 04:33.880
for the legendary firebrand

04:33.930 --> 04:34.895
Jeremiah Corday?

04:34.945 --> 04:35.980
Did you just say firebrand?

04:36.030 --> 04:37.810
I did, what do
you have to say about it?

04:37.860 --> 04:38.643
Yeah.

04:38.693 --> 04:39.476
A rebel.

04:39.526 --> 04:40.690
I'm an icon.

04:40.740 --> 04:42.072
That's true.

04:42.122 --> 04:43.234
I'm a sex symbol.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.067
Ew, stop.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.020
I feel like it's time
for a rebrand for me.

04:47.070 --> 04:48.415
What do you think?

04:48.465 --> 04:50.050
Okay, say more.

04:50.100 --> 04:51.198
I've just been thinking that it's

04:51.240 --> 04:53.950
like, a good time to sell out.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.840
The market is ready for me to sell out.

04:55.890 --> 04:57.610
Jeremiah's selling out.

04:57.660 --> 04:59.331
You've heard it here first, folks.

04:59.381 --> 05:00.172
I'm gonna become a neoliberal shit head.

05:00.214 --> 05:01.832
What do you think?

05:01.882 --> 05:02.665
Ugh, dad.

05:02.715 --> 05:03.820
I'm saying, like, get my ass

05:03.870 --> 05:06.040
into a room with some lobbyists.

05:06.090 --> 05:07.720
Get me a house in the Hamptons, baby.

05:07.770 --> 05:08.830
It's time to sell out.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.920
It's time to make this money.

05:10.970 --> 05:12.096
Okay.

05:12.146 --> 05:12.929
Okay?

05:12.979 --> 05:14.574
Okay.

05:14.624 --> 05:16.098
Could you imagine if
I could actually do that

05:16.140 --> 05:17.860
with a straight face?

05:17.910 --> 05:19.297
You'd get elected.

05:19.347 --> 05:20.625
I'd get elected, yes.

05:20.675 --> 05:22.511
I would be
your, you know, obviously...

05:22.561 --> 05:23.637
First sister.

05:23.687 --> 05:24.738
Yeah, first sister.

05:24.780 --> 05:26.530
I guess we'll just have
to settle for another year

05:26.580 --> 05:29.621
of trying to change the world.

05:46.825 --> 05:48.490
Ugh, I thought it would clear things up

05:48.540 --> 05:50.440
because Jeremiah always used to say

05:50.490 --> 05:54.130
that misinformation was a plague,

05:54.180 --> 05:57.611
especially during Trump, and especially,

05:57.661 --> 05:59.670
ugh, especially during COVID.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.320
So you guys, once and for all,

06:02.370 --> 06:04.570
Jeremiah was not murdered.

06:04.620 --> 06:08.740
He had an old car and the brakes were bad.

06:08.790 --> 06:12.400
And we always told
him, "Fix your car, dude."

06:12.450 --> 06:16.150
He never did, because of
course he had better things to do.

06:16.200 --> 06:19.030
And so one night it was raining

06:19.080 --> 06:21.580
and he hydroplaned and he died.

06:21.630 --> 06:23.110
There was a fire.

06:23.160 --> 06:26.350
I know that it's the internet
and you trolls be trolling.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.710
But please, please just stop.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.360
Just imagine if it was you.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.793
And your family, your
brother, your best friend.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.800
And imagine that all you
had to go on was teeth.

06:41.850 --> 06:43.210
Hi daddy.

06:43.260 --> 06:44.160
You need help?

06:44.210 --> 06:44.993
No, no, no. - Come-

06:45.043 --> 06:45.826
No, I'm good.

06:45.876 --> 06:46.659
I'm good.

06:46.709 --> 06:47.492
Are you sure?

06:47.542 --> 06:48.375
Yeah, don't get up.

06:52.229 --> 06:53.333
Okay.

06:54.540 --> 06:55.323
What?

06:55.373 --> 06:56.728
There's a mess.

06:56.778 --> 06:58.540
That's okay.

06:58.590 --> 06:59.920
A spill.

06:59.970 --> 07:01.053
I'll clean it up.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.143
What am I here for, daddy?

07:05.715 --> 07:06.513
I'm bugging you.

07:06.563 --> 07:07.863
No, no, I'm done.

07:11.310 --> 07:12.260
Where's Jeremiah?

07:14.688 --> 07:15.621
Ugh.

07:20.430 --> 07:23.080
Joining us now is Antigone Corday.

07:23.130 --> 07:24.700
Antigone, it goes without saying,

07:24.750 --> 07:28.450
but I gotta say it: that everyone here is,

07:28.500 --> 07:32.260
we're devastated. And we're so, so sorry.

07:32.310 --> 07:33.093
Thank you.

07:33.143 --> 07:36.070
Jeremiah meant so much
to each and every one of us,

07:36.120 --> 07:38.320
and I absolutely loved him.

07:38.370 --> 07:41.350
And I'm sure most of
my viewers know this...

07:41.400 --> 07:44.920
The illustrious career of
Jeremiah Corday began

07:44.970 --> 07:49.330
when he was a lowly intern
on the Tim Remus Show.

07:49.380 --> 07:52.390
And we were a tiny operation at the time.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.580
He loved the show, and he kept emailing me,

07:54.630 --> 07:55.630
and he wouldn't stop.

07:55.680 --> 07:59.207
And one day he shows up at
the office with his bag, says,

07:59.257 --> 08:00.587
"I drove all the way from Tulsa,"

08:00.637 --> 08:02.027
"and you don't have to pay me."

08:02.077 --> 08:02.957
"I'll work for free."

08:03.007 --> 08:05.410
"I just want to be a journalist,"

08:05.460 --> 08:07.660
which is trademark Jeremiah.

08:07.710 --> 08:09.130
From the moment I saw the guy,

08:09.180 --> 08:10.420
from the moment he opened his mouth,

08:10.470 --> 08:12.670
I could tell this person was remarkable.

08:12.720 --> 08:13.660
He was extraordinary.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.910
You know, half the time
he knew more than I did.

08:15.960 --> 08:17.920
And so pretty soon he was working here.

08:17.970 --> 08:20.290
And pretty soon he was
pitching stories, and of course,

08:20.340 --> 08:22.540
because he's Jeremiah,
they were incredible.

08:22.590 --> 08:24.880
The first video we ever did

08:24.930 --> 08:27.430
that crossed two million
views, was one he pitched.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.013
Oh, I remember that.

08:29.063 --> 08:32.320
Oh, that was such an amazing time for us.

08:32.370 --> 08:35.500
That was what, like, six years ago now?

08:35.550 --> 08:37.150
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

08:37.200 --> 08:37.983
But you know what?

08:38.033 --> 08:42.700
He was about to quit
politics before he came to you.

08:42.750 --> 08:43.900
So, seriously, thank you.

08:43.950 --> 08:46.690
You saved his life.

08:46.740 --> 08:49.380
Well, Antigone, thank you so much.

08:49.430 --> 08:52.090
He had this, this shit job.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.130
He had a master's degree and he was working

08:54.180 --> 08:55.750
at a restaurant as a host.

08:55.800 --> 08:56.740
Wow. - You know, he,

08:56.790 --> 08:59.350
he was putting all of
his energy into that job,

08:59.400 --> 09:03.310
and he had no time to
do the research he wanted

09:03.360 --> 09:05.590
or do the social media push

09:05.640 --> 09:08.710
that would really create him a platform.

09:08.760 --> 09:09.700
And you know what?

09:09.750 --> 09:10.813
He was... He was so charming.

09:10.863 --> 09:14.200
And he was so magnetic,
and damn, he was brilliant.

09:14.250 --> 09:15.163
Right, you know?

09:15.213 --> 09:17.200
So we talked about it, and I said,

09:17.250 --> 09:21.040
"Why don't you just go, go to Tim?"

09:21.090 --> 09:24.933
And so he did, and, you know,

09:26.100 --> 09:28.030
all the rest is... - The rest is history.

09:28.080 --> 09:32.350
Absolutely.

09:32.400 --> 09:37.060
So we've put together a
little reel of Jeremiah's work,

09:37.110 --> 09:39.273
some from my show, some from his show.

09:40.410 --> 09:42.513
Just some classics, you know?

09:43.620 --> 09:46.120
And I have to warn you, if
you're new to Jeremiah's work,

09:46.170 --> 09:50.920
that this will not come
close to capturing his impact,

09:50.970 --> 09:55.713
his wisdom, his humor,
his extraordinary insight.

09:57.300 --> 10:00.070
But I hope it'll give you an idea.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.163
So let's roll the clip.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.310
I'm just saying, compared
to fuckin' Hillary Clinton,

10:06.360 --> 10:09.370
Bill Cosby is basically Mother Teresa.

10:09.420 --> 10:10.210
Whoa.

10:10.260 --> 10:11.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:11.490 --> 10:12.798
Tell me I'm wrong,
you know that I'm right.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.020
Okay, you know what?

10:14.070 --> 10:16.270
It's just... elaborate

10:16.320 --> 10:17.410
uh, please? - Okay, I mean,

10:17.460 --> 10:19.780
first of all, she's a fucking war criminal.

10:19.830 --> 10:21.167
Right, look at Libya.

10:21.217 --> 10:22.312
That, well, it's just uh-

10:22.354 --> 10:24.160
And you know that I hate President Trump.

10:24.210 --> 10:25.450
Well, that makes two of us.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.250
Well, when he said that she started

10:27.300 --> 10:29.350
ISIS, I lost my shit.

10:29.400 --> 10:32.560
I mean, they march in there extralegally

10:32.610 --> 10:34.833
and destabilize the entire region.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.690
I mean, you can't
argue with that one, right?

10:37.740 --> 10:41.350
I mean, Gaddafi was a
monster, but compared to ISIS?

10:41.400 --> 10:43.750
Compared to ISIS, he's Mother Teresa.

10:43.800 --> 10:44.890
He's Bill Cosby.

10:44.940 --> 10:47.140
He's Bill Cosby.

10:47.190 --> 10:49.570
Thank
you, our first question?

10:49.620 --> 10:50.680
Alright, yes.

10:50.730 --> 10:53.830
Madam Vice President, you
and President Biden campaigned

10:53.880 --> 10:58.000
on a platform of unity and equality.

10:58.050 --> 11:00.160
Time and time again, you
specifically called attention

11:00.210 --> 11:05.163
to the inhumane camps
at the US-Mexico border.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.970
As of right now, there
are more people detained

11:10.020 --> 11:12.580
in those camps than at any time

11:12.630 --> 11:14.800
during President Trump's tenure.

11:14.850 --> 11:19.120
How long will you stand
on black and brown bodies

11:19.170 --> 11:21.693
to further your own ambitions?

11:23.280 --> 11:26.200
I guess as a followup
question, I would love to know,

11:26.250 --> 11:27.933
how can you sleep at night?

11:29.700 --> 11:31.030
Jeremy, lemme tell you something,

11:31.080 --> 11:34.300
but yes, I will and I have before, listen.

11:34.350 --> 11:36.700
The calls are getting louder and louder.

11:36.750 --> 11:37.668
This is what I'm talking about.

11:37.710 --> 11:39.880
Top Democrats from New
York to the White House,

11:39.930 --> 11:42.370
calling on Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign.

11:42.420 --> 11:44.440
Jeremiah Corday joins us now.

11:44.490 --> 11:45.820
Jeremiah's a correspondent

11:45.870 --> 11:48.010
with the Tim Remus Show on YouTube.

11:48.060 --> 11:48.843
Thank you, Don.

11:48.893 --> 11:49.750
Thanks for having me on.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.430
This is something that nobody

11:51.480 --> 11:52.990
would've predicted last year.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.420
It's pretty disappointing
and it's pretty shocking.

11:55.470 --> 11:56.538
It's a shocking development, yes.

11:56.580 --> 11:57.760
Shocking is the right word.

11:57.810 --> 12:00.700
It was actually shocking
when he let thousands

12:00.750 --> 12:04.383
of old people die last year,
and no one reported on it.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.650
Sexual harassment is wrong
and it should not be tolerated.

12:08.700 --> 12:11.470
It should be condemned
and punished and prosecuted.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.170
But, you know, I think that
negligent homicide is kind

12:14.220 --> 12:15.280
of a bigger deal here.

12:15.330 --> 12:18.040
At best, it was negligent homicide.

12:18.090 --> 12:22.150
You know, at worst, it's a
holocaust of grandmothers.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.020
A...

12:23.070 --> 12:25.210
a holocaust of grandmothers.

12:25.260 --> 12:26.650
Jeremiah Corday.

12:26.700 --> 12:28.810
Yeah, I was thinking that
maybe you should put that

12:28.860 --> 12:30.403
on T-shirts and sell it.

12:30.453 --> 12:32.860
You know what, I'll give
you a cut of the merch.

12:32.910 --> 12:35.080
I want a percentage if you sell

12:35.130 --> 12:36.380
Holocaust of grandmother T-shirts.

12:36.430 --> 12:37.780
Yeah, yeah.

12:37.830 --> 12:39.910
Okay, I gotta ask, once
it was all said and done,

12:39.960 --> 12:40.998
and once the interview was over,

12:41.040 --> 12:43.600
like, how pissed were they?

12:43.650 --> 12:44.890
Dude, they were so pissed. They...

12:44.940 --> 12:48.190
I left the studio and walked
back to my dressing room,

12:48.240 --> 12:50.200
and they had locked the door.

12:50.250 --> 12:52.690
And they put all of
my shit in a plastic bag

12:52.740 --> 12:54.370
and just dropped it at the door.

12:54.420 --> 12:55.540
No one even talked to me.

12:55.590 --> 12:58.810
I would say that that sounds like a hint.

12:58.860 --> 13:01.870
Yeah, I don't think that
the people there like it

13:01.920 --> 13:03.700
when you speak truth to power.

13:03.750 --> 13:08.343
Okay, let's take a question
from the super chat.

13:09.210 --> 13:12.490
Jeremiah, why are you so much harder

13:12.540 --> 13:14.770
on the left than you are the right?

13:14.820 --> 13:15.603
Wow.

13:15.653 --> 13:16.788
First of all, I love this question.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.190
Thank you.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.170
I'm not, I mean, I see
where you're coming from.

13:20.220 --> 13:22.663
I am, I am more...

13:22.713 --> 13:24.910
I am more critical of the left.

13:24.960 --> 13:25.743
I agree.

13:25.793 --> 13:27.520
But anybody with a brain to think,

13:27.570 --> 13:29.470
anyone with a conscience
would agree with me

13:29.520 --> 13:32.110
that the right is totally corrupt,

13:32.160 --> 13:34.660
totally morally bankrupt at this point.

13:34.710 --> 13:38.440
But my problem is that on the left, we love

13:38.490 --> 13:40.300
to fancy ourselves as the party

13:40.350 --> 13:44.710
that holds ourselves to
a higher moral standard.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.750
I would love to think that a big part

13:46.800 --> 13:50.260
of what I'm trying to do
is to present that standard

13:51.360 --> 13:53.733
and to try and hold
these leaders accountable.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.220
Because I do believe that
real change is possible.

13:57.270 --> 14:01.390
Real actual human change is possible.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.930
James Joyce once wrote
that history is a nightmare

14:04.980 --> 14:07.600
from which I am trying to awake.

14:07.650 --> 14:08.500
I love that.

14:08.550 --> 14:11.410
I love that. I'm inspired by that.

14:11.460 --> 14:15.580
If you really study it,
you'll see that our time

14:15.630 --> 14:19.570
on this planet has been
nothing short of a horrible,

14:19.620 --> 14:24.620
horrible nightmare with wars,
and diseases, and oppression.

14:25.170 --> 14:29.320
But we're doing a whole lot
better than we used to be doing.

14:29.370 --> 14:32.440
Human beings are in a
much better position now

14:32.490 --> 14:36.550
than we were because enough people stood up

14:36.600 --> 14:39.490
and raised their voices and
made something happen.

14:39.540 --> 14:41.740
And when our time is
up and we pass that torch

14:41.790 --> 14:44.260
to the next generation,
and they pass that torch

14:44.310 --> 14:47.110
to the next generation,
and that generation passes it

14:47.160 --> 14:49.900
to the next generation, then maybe,

14:49.950 --> 14:53.650
just maybe in some
distant future, you know,

14:53.700 --> 14:56.796
history can be a dream come true.

14:56.846 --> 14:59.560
Thank you so much.

14:59.610 --> 15:03.160
Jeremiah is, he's irreplaceable.

15:03.210 --> 15:04.570
I know.

15:04.620 --> 15:07.780
There's, there's a,
there's a, a, a spill.

15:07.830 --> 15:09.230
I know, it's okay.

15:10.294 --> 15:11.085
Not right now.

15:11.127 --> 15:12.218
I'm so sorry.

15:12.268 --> 15:13.840
Oh, that's perfectly fine.

15:13.890 --> 15:15.760
I'm so sorry, this seems like a good note

15:15.810 --> 15:16.593
to end on, though.

15:16.643 --> 15:18.183
For sure, yeah, yeah.

15:20.100 --> 15:23.380
I think, sorry, I think
your partner is still, uh.

15:23.430 --> 15:25.870
Oh, that's not my partner, that's my dad.

15:25.920 --> 15:27.186
I'm gonna be a single mom, so...

15:27.236 --> 15:28.750
I'm sorry. Eddie, hey!

15:28.800 --> 15:30.250
How are you, Eddie?

15:30.300 --> 15:32.080
Hey, it's been ages, how are you doing?

15:32.130 --> 15:34.377
You look different, I didn't recognize you.

15:34.427 --> 15:36.190
Hi, Tim.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.180
Hello, Eddie.

15:37.230 --> 15:38.350
Yeah, he can't hear you,

15:38.400 --> 15:41.875
but I'll send along the message.

15:48.870 --> 15:51.070
This is not gonna be
me crying all the time.

15:52.969 --> 15:55.519
I have cried all day and
I'm really, really scared.

15:57.060 --> 16:00.100
And if this is a prank,
it is really fucked up.

16:00.150 --> 16:00.933
Okay?

16:00.983 --> 16:02.373
Please just stop.

16:03.750 --> 16:05.857
This showed up at my door today

16:05.907 --> 16:09.153
and it came with a camera,
which I'm using now,

16:10.350 --> 16:13.540
and a laptop and this note.

16:13.590 --> 16:18.590
And the note said to turn on
the laptop and film the camera.

16:21.720 --> 16:24.880
Sorry, my brain is just
really going everywhere.

16:24.930 --> 16:27.880
But,

16:27.930 --> 16:30.310
the note said to turn on the laptop

16:30.360 --> 16:34.480
and film the screen, and
I think it's just impossible.

16:34.530 --> 16:36.190
Or maybe I'm going crazy or something

16:36.240 --> 16:37.593
but this is what was on it.

16:46.041 --> 16:47.538
Okay, so the note told me

16:47.580 --> 16:48.880
to watch the video in here

16:49.997 --> 16:52.043
in case the house is bugged.

16:52.093 --> 16:54.120
The only thing on this laptop is the video,

16:54.170 --> 16:55.473
so I guess let's watch it.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.543
Hey, Antigone.

17:07.800 --> 17:08.823
I'm alive.

17:11.763 --> 17:15.850
I'm so sorry for everything
that I've put you through.

17:15.900 --> 17:17.650
I love you.

17:17.700 --> 17:20.140
Please just trust that
this was the only way

17:20.190 --> 17:21.640
that things could happen.

17:21.690 --> 17:22.523
Alright?

17:23.730 --> 17:26.710
I'm in danger and you are in danger,

17:26.760 --> 17:28.203
and dad's in danger.

17:30.480 --> 17:35.480
I just watched your interview
with Tim, and I was so moved.

17:37.380 --> 17:42.380
Thank you for your hope and
your optimism, and your heart.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.913
I wish I had that hope right now.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.003
But I don't.

17:52.590 --> 17:54.370
Everything that I've been fighting for,

17:54.420 --> 17:55.870
everything that I've been believing in

17:55.920 --> 17:57.663
has been called into question.

17:59.490 --> 18:04.113
Something terrible and
horrible is about to happen.

18:06.300 --> 18:10.630
Worse than 9-11 or
COVID, or any of that shit.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.240
Okay, but we can stop it, Antigone.

18:13.290 --> 18:15.940
We can stop it, but we
have to work together.

18:15.990 --> 18:16.823
Alright?

18:19.926 --> 18:21.276
I need you to listen to me.

18:22.590 --> 18:24.663
Don't trust anyone,

18:25.890 --> 18:27.603
alright? Don't talk to anyone.

18:28.860 --> 18:30.850
Take that camera that I sent you

18:30.900 --> 18:32.920
and record everything, alright?

18:32.970 --> 18:34.390
I need you to record everything.

18:34.440 --> 18:37.000
Don't use your phone, use the camera.

18:37.050 --> 18:38.463
It's much more secure.

18:39.750 --> 18:42.490
Reality is completely
upside down right now.

18:42.540 --> 18:43.990
And I could explain everything to you,

18:44.040 --> 18:45.760
but it would take five hours, and honestly,

18:45.810 --> 18:47.380
it wouldn't make much of a difference.

18:47.430 --> 18:48.730
But here's what we can do.

18:48.780 --> 18:51.550
Take that camera, hit record, stand up,

18:51.600 --> 18:54.130
walk to the window, point it to the sky.

18:54.180 --> 18:55.540
Alright?

18:55.590 --> 18:57.490
I'm gonna give you 40
seconds and then come back

18:57.540 --> 18:59.190
and watch the rest of this video.

19:03.510 --> 19:07.150
If you're still looking at me
right now on this video, stop.

19:07.200 --> 19:10.690
I'm telling you to stand up,
walk to the window and film.

19:10.740 --> 19:13.323
This is a pre-recorded
video, it's not live.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.940
So go and do it, okay?

19:15.990 --> 19:16.823
I love you.

19:17.670 --> 19:19.699
Trust me, go.

19:29.122 --> 19:32.018
Oh my gosh.

19:33.633 --> 19:34.716
What is that?

19:37.863 --> 19:38.696
Is that?

19:50.103 --> 19:51.520
Okay, okay, okay.

19:52.740 --> 19:54.003
Pretty amazing, right?

19:57.594 --> 20:01.690
And before you ask, no, I'm
not on a spaceship, obviously.

20:01.740 --> 20:03.123
I haven't been abducted.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.530
I'm just trying to show you

20:05.580 --> 20:07.660
that things are not what they seem.

20:07.710 --> 20:10.113
Okay, and you can't trust anyone right now.

20:12.030 --> 20:15.790
Things are about to
get very, very dangerous.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.000
But you have a huge part
to play in all of this, okay?

20:19.050 --> 20:21.450
I need you to keep doing
what you've been doing.

20:22.500 --> 20:23.283
Alright?

20:23.333 --> 20:25.900
Keep giving interviews,
keep making YouTube videos.

20:25.950 --> 20:27.340
Keep talking to people.

20:27.390 --> 20:29.470
Mourn my loss, that's key.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.910
It's important that people think

20:30.960 --> 20:32.800
that I'm dead, alright,
you can't say anything

20:32.850 --> 20:34.150
about this to anyone.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.580
Don't tell anyone about this video.

20:36.630 --> 20:40.570
And please, please do
not call the cops, alright?

20:40.620 --> 20:43.053
So many people that I
thought were my friends,

20:44.100 --> 20:45.970
so many people that I
thought were my allies,

20:46.020 --> 20:47.620
turned out not to be, they're...

20:49.650 --> 20:51.520
And I know I sound crazy when I say this.

20:51.570 --> 20:52.353
You fuckin'...

20:52.403 --> 20:55.270
You know that I hate conspiracies,

20:55.320 --> 20:56.920
but a lot of these people are aligned

20:56.970 --> 20:59.403
with forces that are fucking evil.

21:02.100 --> 21:05.170
So just keep recording
everything, that's all we can do.

21:05.220 --> 21:07.810
Make a document, record everything.

21:07.860 --> 21:08.693
Alright?

21:10.020 --> 21:11.508
The last thing I need
you to do is I need you

21:11.550 --> 21:12.820
to go to my apartment.

21:12.870 --> 21:14.620
You've got the keys.

21:14.670 --> 21:17.290
Go inside, grab my laptop.

21:17.340 --> 21:20.260
And there's a plastic bag in the tank

21:20.310 --> 21:22.503
of the toilet in my bathroom.

21:23.940 --> 21:25.510
Take that bag.

21:25.560 --> 21:27.790
Don't watch the contents
that are inside of it.

21:27.840 --> 21:28.623
Not yet, alright?

21:28.673 --> 21:30.093
Wait till you hear from me.

21:33.030 --> 21:34.683
I love you so much.

21:36.780 --> 21:38.565
Thank you for trusting me.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.273
I'll be in touch soon.

21:52.080 --> 21:54.610
What we're really seeing here is the dawn

21:54.660 --> 21:58.120
of a post-human era, a time of ascendance

21:58.170 --> 21:59.673
for those deemed worthy.

22:00.930 --> 22:03.310
And what makes someone worthy?

22:03.360 --> 22:06.423
How does man or woman ascend to godhood?

22:08.190 --> 22:11.943
I'm not talking about some
phony, Christian superstition.

22:12.780 --> 22:15.250
If you wanna see, you
know, all the good that

22:15.300 --> 22:17.200
thoughts and prayers have done,

22:17.250 --> 22:19.360
you can go walk through a cemetery.

22:19.410 --> 22:20.950
But there are gods.

22:21.000 --> 22:21.880
They're real.

22:21.930 --> 22:24.130
The worthy have always known this.

22:24.180 --> 22:26.290
And you can look at sacrifice, you know,

22:26.340 --> 22:30.280
as barbaric or primitive,
but that's just ignorant.

22:30.330 --> 22:32.140
The god's demand sacrifice.

22:32.190 --> 22:36.430
Because, I mean, there's a
whole lot that this accomplishes.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.190
But, you know, one thing, although it's

22:39.240 --> 22:42.880
not the main thing is
it draws their attention.

22:42.930 --> 22:46.810
And it shows the gods that
the one performing the sacrifice

22:46.860 --> 22:49.090
is asking to be like them.

22:49.140 --> 22:52.570
We're saying, you know,
"Let me into your club."

22:52.620 --> 22:55.960
So that is, that's exactly
what we're telling them.

22:56.010 --> 22:58.450
And there's a ritual element, of course.

22:58.500 --> 23:00.100
But, you know, sacrifice,

23:00.150 --> 23:04.060
sacrifice can take, obviously,
a lot of different forms.

23:04.110 --> 23:06.940
You can undermine and
you can, well, shift, you know,

23:06.990 --> 23:09.940
power structures and topple governments.

23:09.990 --> 23:12.400
So now you've created an environment, okay,

23:12.450 --> 23:14.920
where lots of people are going to die

23:14.970 --> 23:17.050
and you get their attention.

23:17.100 --> 23:20.080
You can take advantage
of a natural disaster

23:20.130 --> 23:22.600
and march in there with a nonprofit

23:22.650 --> 23:24.580
and funnel children away.

23:24.630 --> 23:27.520
These kids, you know, are, they're orphans.

23:27.570 --> 23:29.470
They're gonna die regardless.

23:29.520 --> 23:32.133
But they can be used for a higher purpose.

23:33.960 --> 23:36.280
Their purpose is to create a bridge,

23:36.330 --> 23:39.183
is to open a line of communication.

23:44.040 --> 23:44.935
Okay?

23:44.985 --> 23:46.193
What, what do you want me to do?

23:46.243 --> 23:48.790
I want you to smash it, daddy.

23:48.840 --> 23:49.623
What?

23:49.673 --> 23:50.538
That computer right there.

23:50.580 --> 23:51.400
You see?

23:51.450 --> 23:52.465
Right in front of you?

23:52.515 --> 23:53.298
It's black.

23:53.348 --> 23:54.520
Yeah, you got it.

23:54.570 --> 23:57.850
You want me to break it with a hamper?

23:57.900 --> 23:59.118
Yes, I want you to smash

23:59.160 --> 24:01.030
the living daylights out of it.

24:01.080 --> 24:02.170
Why honey?

24:02.220 --> 24:03.700
Because it's my old laptop

24:03.750 --> 24:06.670
and I'm getting a new one, and I need to,

24:06.720 --> 24:10.010
I need to destroy it so that
no one steals my identity.

24:10.893 --> 24:11.676
Oh god, hold on.

24:11.726 --> 24:15.077
Oh, yeah, you, you keep
going while I take this phone call.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.440
Hello?

24:17.490 --> 24:20.140
Hi, is this Antigone Corday?

24:20.190 --> 24:21.400
Yes, this is she.

24:21.450 --> 24:22.750
Who is this?

24:22.800 --> 24:24.070
Hi, this is Jake Hernandez

24:24.120 --> 24:25.300
with Lockridge & Associates.

24:25.350 --> 24:27.040
Oh, hi.

24:27.090 --> 24:29.140
Oh my gosh, thank you so much

24:29.190 --> 24:31.720
for the flowers Mark sent me, and the card.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.783
It's so appreciated.

24:34.740 --> 24:35.590
Oh, great, yeah.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.547
I'll let him know.

24:36.597 --> 24:39.490
And all of us here are,
we're absolutely devastated.

24:39.540 --> 24:41.020
Jeremiah is such a huge loss.

24:41.070 --> 24:43.630
And please know that
you and your family are

24:43.680 --> 24:44.890
in our thoughts right now.

24:44.940 --> 24:46.180
Yes, thank you, thank you.

24:46.230 --> 24:48.220
I really appreciate that.

24:48.270 --> 24:50.500
And well, so, listen,
Mark saw your interview

24:50.550 --> 24:52.750
on Tim's show and we
saw what you were doing

24:52.800 --> 24:56.230
with your channel, and we love it.

24:56.280 --> 24:57.100
Wow, thank you.

24:57.150 --> 24:58.553
That's so nice of you to say.

24:58.603 --> 25:00.550
I really appreciate that.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.770
Well, other people
have been watching too,

25:02.820 --> 25:04.008
and they've been reaching out to us.

25:04.050 --> 25:07.960
And I think there are a
couple of opportunities,

25:08.010 --> 25:10.210
obviously, whenever you're ready.

25:10.260 --> 25:12.108
Opportunities?

25:12.158 --> 25:13.720
So Mark would probably wanna talk

25:13.770 --> 25:15.250
through the details with you.

25:15.300 --> 25:16.091
And I'm really sorry bringing up business

25:16.133 --> 25:17.440
at a time like this.

25:17.490 --> 25:18.273
Oh, no, no.

25:18.323 --> 25:19.540
Please, please.

25:19.590 --> 25:21.733
Business is all I wanna
think about, you trust me.

25:21.783 --> 25:24.883
It's a great distraction, so thank you.

25:24.933 --> 25:25.878
Well, there's something

25:25.920 --> 25:29.470
that's a bit time sensitive,
and Mark let me know

25:29.520 --> 25:33.220
that he could make himself available today.

25:33.270 --> 25:34.053
Yeah, okay.

25:34.103 --> 25:36.398
Yeah, just let me know when and I'm there.

25:37.648 --> 25:38.560
Okay.

25:38.610 --> 25:43.610
So I am about to meet Mark
Bruce, Jeremiah's literary agent.

25:46.470 --> 25:48.070
Jeremiah has a book coming

25:48.120 --> 25:52.533
out later this year, or he had one.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.910
But Mark says that he
has a surprise for me,

25:57.960 --> 26:02.373
so I think I'm a little bit surprised out.

26:04.956 --> 26:06.400
But we'll see.

26:06.450 --> 26:08.770
So tell me, are you working on anything?

26:08.820 --> 26:10.510
Got anything in the pipe?

26:10.560 --> 26:11.810
Oh, yeah, no, I'm...

26:12.960 --> 26:16.930
Yes I'm, I have taken over
Jeremiah's channel, so I'm,

26:16.980 --> 26:20.380
that's keeping me very busy
and I'm really grateful for that

26:20.430 --> 26:23.853
because, oh boy, I don't know if I,

26:25.200 --> 26:27.040
if I didn't have that
right now, I think I would

26:27.090 --> 26:29.950
just collapse and curl up into a ball,

26:30.000 --> 26:33.093
and yeah, it's saving me.

26:33.930 --> 26:35.103
Yeah, I get that.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.503
My son died last year.

26:38.460 --> 26:40.180
Shot himself.

26:40.230 --> 26:42.483
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

26:43.440 --> 26:46.600
I know, everyone was, but I
mean, what else can you say?

26:46.650 --> 26:47.560
Right?

26:47.610 --> 26:49.987
Everyone's walking on eggshells around you

26:50.037 --> 26:51.813
and you just don't give a shit.

26:53.195 --> 26:56.200
Hmm, yeah. - Because

26:56.250 --> 27:00.160
there's nothing anyone really can say.

27:00.210 --> 27:03.310
There's no comfort, there's no consolation,

27:03.360 --> 27:04.863
there's no fixing it.

27:05.700 --> 27:08.410
I took two days to just
sob and sob, and sob,

27:08.460 --> 27:12.010
and stare at the wall and
forget to take a shower.

27:12.060 --> 27:14.343
And it was, it was killing me.

27:15.570 --> 27:19.233
But the day of Harry's funeral, I worked.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.260
It's probably because
it hadn't fully set in,

27:23.310 --> 27:27.753
really, you know, and
I was just going crazy.

27:28.613 --> 27:30.550
Right. - And I hadn't processed it.

27:30.600 --> 27:34.630
And I felt like I needed to work, I had to.

27:34.680 --> 27:37.510
And it made me sane, it was therapeutic.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.580
Yeah, no, I definitely understand that.

27:39.630 --> 27:43.060
Were like kindred spirits there, for sure.

27:43.110 --> 27:45.610
Well, if you need time,
just let me know, okay?

27:45.660 --> 27:49.353
But I'm not gonna ask, 'cause
I hated it when they asked me.

27:50.580 --> 27:52.510
Sounds good, thank you.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.280
Yeah, you're welcome.

27:54.330 --> 27:57.453
So let's get down to business then?

27:58.350 --> 27:59.650
Please, let's do it.

27:59.700 --> 28:00.533
Okay.

28:01.530 --> 28:05.380
So I saw you on Tim Remus,
and I've been watching

28:05.430 --> 28:06.790
all the stuff you've been uploading,

28:06.840 --> 28:09.040
you know, all of those Jeremiah clips

28:09.090 --> 28:12.520
and especially the,

28:12.570 --> 28:15.250
there was this one
clip, what was it called?

28:15.300 --> 28:17.034
The Bill Cosby's Super Cut.

28:17.084 --> 28:17.917
Yes.

28:18.810 --> 28:20.433
The Bill Cosby Super clit.

28:21.330 --> 28:23.080
Yeah, I know.

28:23.130 --> 28:24.116
I figure that the funny s-

28:24.166 --> 28:25.360
Oh man, he.

28:25.410 --> 28:27.310
It's the funny stuff
that's so good right now

28:27.360 --> 28:30.400
'cause it's like, uplifting, you know?

28:30.450 --> 28:31.233
Yeah, that's right.

28:31.283 --> 28:32.976
He was so joyful.

28:33.026 --> 28:35.650
He really was.

28:35.700 --> 28:36.790
Yeah.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.573
So look, people have
been reaching out to me.

28:40.950 --> 28:44.860
Everybody loved Jeremiah
and they loved the work he did.

28:44.910 --> 28:47.290
They love your passion
and the work you're doing.

28:47.340 --> 28:49.630
And they want to help you, I don't know,

28:49.680 --> 28:51.543
carry the torch, so to speak?

28:52.530 --> 28:53.950
That's amazing.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.020
Wow, where do we begin?

28:56.070 --> 28:58.750
Well, first thing we gotta do is

28:58.800 --> 29:01.090
get some big names on your channel, right?

29:01.140 --> 29:05.913
And I think AOC has some
time available tomorrow.

29:07.476 --> 29:08.259
AOC?

29:08.309 --> 29:11.080
Wow, that would be actually incredible.

29:11.130 --> 29:12.970
I mean, I would be super honored.

29:13.020 --> 29:13.923
Yes, please.

29:13.973 --> 29:14.756
Yeah?

29:14.806 --> 29:15.589
Okay.

29:15.639 --> 29:16.450
That's great.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.760
Told them that I would let them know.

29:18.810 --> 29:22.773
So you're telling me you're
interested, I'll set it up.

29:22.823 --> 29:23.740
Okay? - Yes, I am.

29:23.790 --> 29:25.030
Yes, thank you.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.020
Wow. - Great, yeah.

29:26.070 --> 29:26.913
No problem.

29:28.350 --> 29:31.420
There's one more thing
I wanted to run by you.

29:31.470 --> 29:36.040
Now, the timeline on this is
not super rushed or anything,

29:36.090 --> 29:38.990
but obviously, we would like
to get this sooner than later.

29:40.740 --> 29:44.350
So Jeremiah was a prolific writer, right?

29:44.400 --> 29:46.390
We got his book, it's
pretty much finalized.

29:46.440 --> 29:48.130
We're good there.

29:48.180 --> 29:50.305
But his blog is huge.

29:50.355 --> 29:51.340
Right, yeah.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.173
Right?

29:52.223 --> 29:53.140
Mm-hm. - I mean, there's

29:53.190 --> 29:55.540
just years of content.

29:55.590 --> 29:57.430
Of course. - We could,

29:57.480 --> 29:58.480
I don't know,

29:58.530 --> 30:02.380
compile it, curate it somewhere.

30:02.430 --> 30:03.580
Uh-huh.

30:03.630 --> 30:04.840
Right? - Okay, yeah.

30:04.890 --> 30:07.983
I mean, we would love for
you to write the introduction.

30:09.630 --> 30:12.190
Oh, I mean, yeah, I could try.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.170
I mean, I'm definitely not the writer

30:14.220 --> 30:17.500
that Jeremiah was, but yes, for sure.

30:17.550 --> 30:18.400
Yes.

30:18.450 --> 30:19.600
Great, okay.

30:19.650 --> 30:21.940
And you know, the
last time I talked to him,

30:21.990 --> 30:25.330
he did mention he was
working on something new,

30:25.380 --> 30:27.240
but didn't tell me what that was.

30:27.290 --> 30:29.493
Do you have any insight there?

30:32.190 --> 30:34.390
Well, I will be going
through all of his stuff,

30:34.440 --> 30:38.950
so if I find anything, I can
definitely send it your way.

30:39.000 --> 30:39.783
Great, okay.

30:39.833 --> 30:41.680
That would be very helpful, thank you.

30:43.350 --> 30:44.738
For sure.

30:47.730 --> 30:50.013
So many folks, they have this,

30:51.090 --> 30:54.873
this mistaken conception
that war is a racket.

30:55.950 --> 30:58.030
That's what the profane say, and it's,

30:58.080 --> 30:58.871
well, it's shortsighted,
and it's just about

30:58.913 --> 30:59.746
as old as history.

31:01.890 --> 31:04.870
It's pretty old, but the
truth is older than history.

31:04.920 --> 31:07.600
They say, you know, war's
a means of making money

31:07.650 --> 31:08.980
off the backs and the bodies,

31:09.030 --> 31:12.160
and the blood of folks sent to fight.

31:12.210 --> 31:15.370
And always they'll be similar speculation

31:15.420 --> 31:17.133
on those stuck in the crosshairs.

31:18.578 --> 31:21.040
The innocent civilians, and so on.

31:21.090 --> 31:23.200
Every bit of that is all just,

31:23.250 --> 31:25.173
it's total stupidity and ignorance.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.870
The worthy know that riches are ephemeral.

31:28.920 --> 31:33.280
Human blood is so precious,
so very, very precious,

31:33.330 --> 31:34.983
so much more precious than gold.

31:36.540 --> 31:38.553
Money is illusion.

31:39.540 --> 31:43.060
The only lasting riches
are in transcendence.

31:43.110 --> 31:45.633
And transcendence requires sacrifice.

31:47.310 --> 31:49.893
Brick by brick, we're building a temple.

31:50.880 --> 31:54.970
The builders have labored in
an unbroken line since the dawn

31:55.020 --> 31:57.640
of thought on something enormous

31:57.690 --> 32:00.250
and glorious and final.

32:00.300 --> 32:02.157
It is almost complete.

32:12.408 --> 32:13.191
Okay.

32:13.241 --> 32:14.903
So I just got to Jeremiah's apartment

32:14.953 --> 32:17.680
and I am freaking the fuck out.

32:17.730 --> 32:18.563
Look.

32:21.726 --> 32:22.761
Okay-

32:24.029 --> 32:24.812
Hey!

32:24.862 --> 32:25.891
Oh, hey, Antigone!

32:25.941 --> 32:27.018
Oh my god,
it's so good to see you.

32:27.060 --> 32:28.510
Yeah, you're filming?

32:28.560 --> 32:32.140
Oh yeah, I'm filming
a documentary on Jeremiah.

32:32.190 --> 32:35.403
Oh, I didn't know I was
gonna be in the movies.

32:35.453 --> 32:36.828
Well, oh, sorry.

32:36.870 --> 32:38.650
It's off. - It's fine.

32:38.700 --> 32:39.600
It's totally fine.

32:40.440 --> 32:44.140
Look, I didn't want to
startle you about this, okay,

32:44.190 --> 32:45.550
but someone called me to let me know

32:45.600 --> 32:47.920
that Jeremiah's apartment was broken into.

32:47.970 --> 32:49.120
And I just had to run down here

32:49.170 --> 32:51.400
and make sure everything was still here.

32:51.450 --> 32:53.740
Oh, wow, that's,

32:53.790 --> 32:55.300
that's so nice of you.

32:55.350 --> 32:56.530
You didn't have to do that.

32:56.580 --> 32:57.940
It's no problem at all.

32:57.990 --> 32:59.350
You have so much on your plate.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.780
I didn't want you to have
to worry about this, okay?

33:01.830 --> 33:03.880
And, you know, I was gonna call the cops

33:03.930 --> 33:04.728
and I just had to make sure,

33:04.770 --> 33:06.910
but everything is still here.

33:06.960 --> 33:09.850
But if you find anything
of interest at all,

33:09.900 --> 33:10.930
please let me know.

33:10.980 --> 33:12.348
Okay, yeah, I definitely will.

33:12.390 --> 33:13.240
Please, okay?

33:13.290 --> 33:14.560
Yes, I will.

33:14.610 --> 33:15.393
Awesome.

33:15.443 --> 33:17.530
Okay, well, I was just gonna go in there

33:17.580 --> 33:19.810
and check if there's any
articles of clothing I need

33:19.860 --> 33:22.600
to bring to Goodwill or whatever.

33:22.650 --> 33:24.190
Understood.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.660
Well, I'll leave you to it.

33:25.710 --> 33:26.493
Okay.

33:26.543 --> 33:27.550
Good luck with your movie.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.590
Are you fucking kidding me?

33:29.640 --> 33:31.120
Someone called you?

33:31.170 --> 33:31.960
Who?

33:32.010 --> 33:33.550
So, what, you were intimately familiar

33:33.600 --> 33:35.080
with the details of his apartment?

33:35.130 --> 33:36.640
Oh my god.

33:36.690 --> 33:38.320
Oh my god.

33:38.370 --> 33:39.203
Wait.

33:41.580 --> 33:44.500
Where the fuck is his laptop?

33:44.550 --> 33:45.383
Hey!

33:46.500 --> 33:48.049
Hey.

33:51.916 --> 33:52.750
Hey.

33:52.800 --> 33:53.620
Startled me, there.

33:53.670 --> 33:56.590
Oh my
gosh, I really apologize.

33:56.640 --> 33:57.970
Totally fine, what's up?

33:58.020 --> 34:01.120
Oh, you told me to mention

34:01.170 --> 34:02.380
if anything was missing

34:02.430 --> 34:04.840
and actually, Jeremiah's laptop.

34:04.890 --> 34:05.680
Oh, wow.

34:05.730 --> 34:07.210
Okay.

34:07.260 --> 34:08.530
Did you see it?

34:08.580 --> 34:13.240
It's a MacBook Pro, that
exact model, you know?

34:13.290 --> 34:14.390
Did you see it? - Um.

34:15.660 --> 34:19.000
I, I mean, I'm pretty
sure I would have noticed,

34:19.050 --> 34:22.240
but no, I didn't see anything anywhere.

34:22.290 --> 34:23.320
Are you sure?

34:23.370 --> 34:25.300
I mean, maybe it fell between the cushions

34:25.350 --> 34:26.380
of the couch or something.

34:26.430 --> 34:29.023
But really, aye-yai-yai,
if somebody took that.

34:29.073 --> 34:31.360
I am so sorry.

34:31.410 --> 34:33.610
Oh, that's really okay.

34:33.660 --> 34:37.653
Just, it looks exactly like that one.

34:38.790 --> 34:42.460
Oh god, my brain is in a crazy
place because of Jeremiah,

34:42.510 --> 34:45.610
and I'm just like, kind
of spiraling right now.

34:45.660 --> 34:49.810
So if you could just,
you're, you're totally sure.

34:49.860 --> 34:53.740
I, yeah, but you know, if
you say it's just like this one,

34:53.790 --> 34:58.090
I mean, I get it, but this one is mine.

34:58.140 --> 34:59.350
Oh yeah, no, of course.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.183
I know it's yours.

35:00.233 --> 35:01.210
I didn't mean to imply that-

35:01.260 --> 35:02.170
No, no, I'm sorry.

35:02.220 --> 35:03.003
No problem.

35:03.053 --> 35:04.390
I didn't mean it to come off that way.

35:04.440 --> 35:08.200
What I mean to say is I
took it out of my briefcase

35:08.250 --> 35:11.020
and went upstairs, and in
case I saw anything missing,

35:11.070 --> 35:13.510
I was gonna take some notes
or even shoot off an email.

35:13.560 --> 35:14.440
You know what I mean?

35:14.490 --> 35:15.588
Oh yeah, I know what you mean.

35:15.630 --> 35:16.503
Could you check?

35:18.120 --> 35:20.950
God, I'm so sorry.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.770
I just, could you just, please?

35:23.820 --> 35:25.446
I'm really embarrassed to ask,

35:25.496 --> 35:26.363
but... - Check what?

35:27.990 --> 35:30.130
Your briefcase.

35:30.180 --> 35:32.710
Oh, just to see, because it, it,

35:32.760 --> 35:36.460
it really does look
like that right there, so.

35:36.510 --> 35:37.343
Sure.

35:50.070 --> 35:50.853
Oh.

35:50.903 --> 35:51.736
Well, shit.

35:54.780 --> 35:55.608
Thank you so much

35:55.650 --> 35:58.083
for helping me find that though.

35:59.449 --> 36:01.510
I, I made a mistake.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.397
I'm so sorry.

36:03.447 --> 36:05.950
Oh, no,
it's really no problem.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.113
Thank you so much.

36:08.220 --> 36:09.820
I mean,

36:09.870 --> 36:10.893
gosh, I like,

36:11.760 --> 36:13.990
I thought I took it outta the briefcase,

36:14.040 --> 36:15.040
but I guess I didn't.

36:15.090 --> 36:18.070
And I was up there and
it was all ubba-dob-a-dah.

36:18.120 --> 36:21.430
And I saw the computer and I took it.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.320
But it was his and I thought it was mine.

36:23.370 --> 36:26.268
I must must be sleepwalking.
Mark?

36:26.318 --> 36:27.190
Mark?

36:27.240 --> 36:28.720
I really do get it.

36:28.770 --> 36:30.430
So you really don't need to explain.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.313
Can I just?

36:32.190 --> 36:32.973
Sure.

36:33.023 --> 36:34.057
I'll just take it.

36:37.798 --> 36:38.732
Thank you. - There you go.

36:38.776 --> 36:40.167
Thank you so much.

36:40.217 --> 36:41.110
Have a good night.

36:41.160 --> 36:41.993
You too.

36:43.950 --> 36:45.520
Okay, well, if that wasn't weird enough,

36:45.570 --> 36:48.220
I feel like I literally just
stepped into the Twilight Zone

36:48.270 --> 36:51.250
because after I caught Mark doing

36:51.300 --> 36:53.980
some really freaking weird James Bond shit

36:54.030 --> 36:59.030
with the laptop, I come
back and I find this.

36:59.160 --> 37:01.360
I mean, apparently the owl from space

37:01.410 --> 37:03.160
or hell has gotten in.

37:03.210 --> 37:05.981
I mean, I have no idea how it did.

37:06.864 --> 37:09.220
I really just wanna get the you-know-what

37:09.270 --> 37:12.610
from the toilet tank and
get the fuck up out of here.

37:14.433 --> 37:17.793
So, here I go.

37:19.410 --> 37:20.643
Wish me luck.

37:23.520 --> 37:25.090
Okay, buddy.

37:25.140 --> 37:26.553
I come in peace.

37:46.282 --> 37:49.713
Oh, gosh.

37:55.080 --> 37:55.913
Okay.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.237
Thank you, Jeremiah.

38:07.110 --> 38:11.553
Okay, so I've seen like, five
of them on the drive so far.

38:12.600 --> 38:15.100
But they just whoosh
by or hover for a second,

38:15.150 --> 38:16.473
and then they disappear.

38:17.730 --> 38:22.473
But these have just been
sitting there for a couple minutes.

38:25.091 --> 38:26.320
Okay.

38:26.370 --> 38:28.810
I can't say that I am more
freaked out than I was before,

38:28.860 --> 38:31.060
but I am pretty freaked out.

38:31.110 --> 38:32.500
They are right outside my house.

38:32.550 --> 38:33.483
What do they want?

38:34.470 --> 38:39.470
Oh, if I saw this video,
I would not believe me.

38:57.240 --> 38:58.272
Jeremiah?

39:00.480 --> 39:03.468
Sorry.

39:03.518 --> 39:04.351
Yeah.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.005
Okay.

39:07.055 --> 39:08.472
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:08.522 --> 39:10.485
No, we don't need to leave the house.

39:10.535 --> 39:12.856
Of course, we have food.

39:12.906 --> 39:14.073
Yup, tomorrow.

39:15.394 --> 39:17.644
AOC, if you can believe it.

39:18.641 --> 39:19.993
Yeah.

39:20.043 --> 39:21.955
I love you so much.

39:22.005 --> 39:24.413
I love you.

39:25.296 --> 39:26.079
Oh my god!

39:26.129 --> 39:27.303
Put the knife down! - I'm sorry!

39:27.353 --> 39:28.136
I'm sorry.

39:28.186 --> 39:28.977
Oh my god! - I'm sorry.

39:29.019 --> 39:30.726
What the fuck, dad?

39:30.776 --> 39:31.943
What the fuck?

39:33.153 --> 39:35.223
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm an owl.

39:36.488 --> 39:37.947
I'm an owl.

39:37.997 --> 39:38.788
What do you mean you're an owl?

39:38.830 --> 39:41.380
I, I, I tried to, I tried
to scare them away.

39:41.430 --> 39:42.580
I was scaring them...

39:42.630 --> 39:44.480
Who'd you try to scare away, daddy?

39:45.717 --> 39:48.160
Hoo, Hoo.

39:48.210 --> 39:49.900
Oh, that's what the owl said.

39:49.950 --> 39:50.741
That's what the owl said.

39:50.783 --> 39:51.940
What do you mean?

39:51.990 --> 39:53.874
Did you see an owl?

39:53.924 --> 39:55.225
I'm going to my room.

39:55.275 --> 39:56.227
I'm going, I'm sorry.

39:56.277 --> 39:58.027
I'm going to my room.

40:02.010 --> 40:05.913
So dad got
into my makeup tonight.

40:07.230 --> 40:09.933
Guess I'm on cleaning duty.

40:11.790 --> 40:12.573
I'm tired.

40:12.623 --> 40:13.414
I know, dad.

40:13.456 --> 40:15.333
I just wanna get this really quick, okay?

40:17.040 --> 40:17.973
Please?

40:18.990 --> 40:19.990
It's embarrassing.

40:21.300 --> 40:23.913
It's not
embarrassing, you were scared.

40:24.810 --> 40:26.440
Did you see something?

40:26.490 --> 40:28.390
Did something happen while I was gone?

40:30.960 --> 40:33.490
It's okay, daddy, you can tell me.

40:33.540 --> 40:34.373
No.

40:35.547 --> 40:36.847
Daddy.

40:38.757 --> 40:39.540
Uh-uh.

40:39.590 --> 40:42.543
You were saying
something about an owl?

40:46.214 --> 40:48.280
Don't say it.

40:48.330 --> 40:49.730
Don't say what?

40:52.680 --> 40:53.823
I know I'm sick.

40:58.560 --> 40:59.770
They're not real.

40:59.820 --> 41:01.208
Dad?

41:01.258 --> 41:02.943
Who, who isn't real?

41:05.940 --> 41:07.960
I don't think they're real, I...

41:08.010 --> 41:08.793
Dad?

41:08.843 --> 41:09.626
I hope they're not.

41:09.676 --> 41:11.503
I don't think you're crazy.

41:15.750 --> 41:18.753
I remember it like a dream.

41:21.930 --> 41:22.780
There were these,

41:24.210 --> 41:25.660
these two owls, and they were

41:27.750 --> 41:29.193
outside at the windows.

41:31.770 --> 41:35.103
But they didn't feel outside.

41:37.262 --> 41:38.462
They felt like they were

41:40.110 --> 41:41.283
inside me.

41:47.370 --> 41:48.333
Vampire

41:49.440 --> 41:54.440
teeth, teeth of the devil.
They're insights, incisors.

41:59.790 --> 42:02.793
Vampire teeth of the devil.

42:06.300 --> 42:07.180
Oh, dad.

42:07.230 --> 42:08.740
They suck on babies.

42:08.790 --> 42:09.753
Dad.

42:12.660 --> 42:13.493
Stupid.

42:17.640 --> 42:19.583
That must have been so scary.

42:21.330 --> 42:22.953
I made a fool of myself.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.683
Well, they went
away, so maybe it worked.

42:31.230 --> 42:34.750
Okay, so my dad's asleep,
so I have to be quiet,

42:34.800 --> 42:37.503
but I am so fucking freaked out right now.

42:39.750 --> 42:43.120
And it's 3:00 AM and I have
the most important interview

42:43.170 --> 42:44.590
of my life in the morning.

42:44.640 --> 42:45.910
And I can't sleep.

42:45.960 --> 42:48.580
And for hours, I've been
tossing and turning in the dark.

42:48.630 --> 42:51.220
But now I'm afraid of
the dark, like a baby.

42:51.270 --> 42:55.120
And I've been going down
this crazy rabbit hole about owls

42:55.170 --> 42:59.110
and UFOs, and apparently
they're like, incredibly connected.

42:59.160 --> 43:03.070
And I've been getting these
emails, these crazy emails

43:03.120 --> 43:05.230
from this guy, Caesar Green,

43:05.280 --> 43:09.040
saying that Jeremiah is
alive and that I'm in danger.

43:09.090 --> 43:12.880
And for those of you who
don't know who Caesar Green is,

43:12.930 --> 43:15.460
he's this crazy conspiracy theory guy

43:15.510 --> 43:17.830
who's been banned, like, everywhere.

43:17.880 --> 43:20.470
And he is a far-right guy

43:20.520 --> 43:23.200
who I truly want nothing to do with.

43:23.250 --> 43:24.940
He's, he's a really bad guy.

43:24.990 --> 43:28.930
He's said that mass shootings
are false flag operations

43:28.980 --> 43:32.890
and has spread incredibly
horrible COVID misinformation,

43:32.940 --> 43:34.780
and election fraud lies.

43:34.830 --> 43:37.180
Bad, bad, bad guy.

43:37.230 --> 43:40.450
But about 45 minutes
ago, he sent me this email

43:41.880 --> 43:46.330
with a link to a video on his website,

43:46.380 --> 43:49.683
Truth Wars, appropriately named.

44:04.140 --> 44:06.310
Ladies and gentlemen, you
may think you know the truth

44:06.360 --> 44:10.990
about UFOs. Or now
they're calling them UAPs:

44:11.040 --> 44:13.424
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena.

44:15.090 --> 44:17.830
You may have watched the X-Files,

44:17.880 --> 44:21.760
seen documentaries, read some books,

44:21.810 --> 44:26.467
maybe even some official
military documents. Declassified.

44:28.680 --> 44:32.253
But they're declassified,
which means they're bullshit.

44:34.260 --> 44:38.260
This is all part of a coordinated campaign

44:38.310 --> 44:40.000
to shape your perceptions.

44:40.050 --> 44:42.573
This is how propaganda works, folks.

44:43.830 --> 44:45.393
Read Edward Bernays.

44:46.290 --> 44:47.800
Read Noam Chomsky.

44:47.850 --> 44:49.863
Read Alex Constantine.

44:51.360 --> 44:53.110
Mind War.

44:53.160 --> 44:54.483
Sci-Ops.

44:56.370 --> 44:59.463
Let's talk about another aerial phenomenon,

45:00.900 --> 45:04.833
one that has been
identified since pre-history.

45:06.840 --> 45:07.673
The owl.

45:09.360 --> 45:13.840
Now what do owls have
to do with UFOs or UAPs

45:13.890 --> 45:16.443
or whatever the elite
wants you to call them?

45:18.630 --> 45:21.520
What would you say if I was to tell you

45:21.570 --> 45:23.920
that owls had everything to do

45:23.970 --> 45:25.923
with those little lights in the sky,

45:27.840 --> 45:31.600
with the abductions and mutilations?

45:31.650 --> 45:35.260
And I'm not just talking
about cattle mutilations.

45:35.310 --> 45:36.670
This is hidden.

45:36.720 --> 45:38.980
This is something they
don't want you to know,

45:39.030 --> 45:41.853
but for every cow they find,

45:43.020 --> 45:44.373
they find 10 people.

45:47.130 --> 45:51.033
Now, this next image is disturbing.

45:52.440 --> 45:53.273
I warn you.

45:56.310 --> 45:59.673
I obtained this from one of
my contacts in intelligence.

46:01.260 --> 46:03.820
Search this online,
and they'll tell you it's

46:03.870 --> 46:06.700
a mob killing from 1982.

46:06.750 --> 46:08.470
A mob killing?

46:08.520 --> 46:11.170
That's like Epstein's Temple.

46:11.220 --> 46:15.910
Remember Jeffrey Epstein
and Pedophile Island?

46:15.960 --> 46:18.033
Where all the elites went to party?

46:19.170 --> 46:22.660
Bill Gates, Bill Clinton?

46:22.710 --> 46:24.850
Anthony Fauci?

46:24.900 --> 46:27.910
And on this private
island, Pedophile Island,

46:27.960 --> 46:31.000
where all the elites would hang out,

46:31.050 --> 46:33.393
there was this building.

46:36.810 --> 46:39.873
Do you know what the
mainstream media said this was?

46:40.860 --> 46:42.460
A music room.

46:42.510 --> 46:43.713
Can you believe that?

46:44.550 --> 46:47.193
What do you need a
mattress in a music room for?

46:50.460 --> 46:51.970
A music room.

46:52.020 --> 46:53.680
A mob killing.

46:53.730 --> 46:55.983
A load of crap is what it is.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.020
And I'm not just rambling here,

46:59.070 --> 47:00.580
these things are connected.

47:00.630 --> 47:02.140
Look at this face.

47:02.190 --> 47:04.300
Does it remind you of anything?

47:04.350 --> 47:06.693
Look closely if you can stomach it.

47:09.990 --> 47:13.600
For millennia, since the
dawn of recorded history,

47:13.650 --> 47:15.880
in every culture you can imagine,

47:15.930 --> 47:18.640
the owl has been seen as a messenger

47:18.690 --> 47:20.620
from the spirit world,

47:20.670 --> 47:22.510
from the underworld.

47:22.560 --> 47:25.090
The owl is a guardian at the gateway

47:25.140 --> 47:29.770
between our world and the
hidden realm of demonic forces.

47:29.820 --> 47:32.860
And all the time,

47:32.910 --> 47:37.720
alien abduction experiences
and UFO sightings are preceded

47:37.770 --> 47:42.770
or followed or connected in
some way or another to owls.

47:43.276 --> 47:46.390
Owls are always showing up at these scenes.

47:46.440 --> 47:49.930
There's a huge body of literature on this.

47:49.980 --> 47:52.360
The elites know all about it.

47:52.410 --> 47:56.283
And look here: that is Bohemian Grove.

47:57.270 --> 48:02.270
Bohemian Grove, where elites
have met for a hundred years.

48:02.940 --> 48:07.940
Presidents, Supreme Court
Justices, business tycoons.

48:08.370 --> 48:10.443
And what is that they're worshiping?

48:11.550 --> 48:13.413
Do I need to spell it out for you?

48:14.880 --> 48:17.710
The video may be a little fuzzy,

48:17.760 --> 48:20.650
but this video is actual footage.

48:20.700 --> 48:22.863
It's acknowledged, it's real.

48:23.700 --> 48:26.393
That is a giant owl deity.

49:24.926 --> 49:29.500
Okay, I am just so nervous and so excited

49:29.550 --> 49:33.460
because my absolute
hero, one of them at least,

49:33.510 --> 49:36.430
AOC is about to be on my show.

49:36.480 --> 49:38.590
And you know what, I'm
just gonna keep it simple.

49:38.640 --> 49:42.010
Talk about Jeremiah, of course, and policy

49:42.060 --> 49:43.680
and advocacy. - Hey.

49:44.520 --> 49:45.303
Hey, daddy.

49:45.353 --> 49:46.233
What is that?

49:47.463 --> 49:49.330
Dad, I'm doing something for work.

49:49.380 --> 49:51.220
What the shit is that?

49:51.270 --> 49:52.180
It's okay, just...

49:52.230 --> 49:54.130
Can you go back into your room please?

49:58.470 --> 50:00.877
So, as I was saying, AOC
is about to be on my show

50:00.927 --> 50:02.973
and I am really excited.

50:03.900 --> 50:05.500
So, great.

50:05.550 --> 50:07.750
Thank you so much.

50:07.800 --> 50:09.730
Women helping women, right?

50:09.780 --> 50:10.840
Totally.

50:10.890 --> 50:12.370
And you're a great interviewer.

50:12.420 --> 50:14.260
You have a great little show going.

50:14.310 --> 50:15.310
Oh, well, thank you.

50:15.360 --> 50:18.340
And of course, I will send
you a copy before I upload.

50:18.390 --> 50:20.470
And if there's anything you want me to edit

50:20.520 --> 50:23.080
or cut out, just please let me know.

50:23.130 --> 50:24.760
Sure. Perfect.

50:24.810 --> 50:26.830
And Mark had just,

50:26.880 --> 50:30.760
he was absolutely glowing
when he spoke about you.

50:30.810 --> 50:32.230
Oh, that's so nice.

50:32.280 --> 50:34.210
Yeah, Mark has been so great.

50:34.260 --> 50:36.550
He's so supportive.

50:36.600 --> 50:39.610
He mentioned that
there's a book coming out?

50:39.660 --> 50:41.470
From Jeremiah, yeah.

50:41.520 --> 50:43.653
Right, and there's gonna be even more?

50:44.970 --> 50:46.060
Well, yeah, hopefully.

50:46.110 --> 50:48.550
I mean, there's so
much that isn't published

50:48.600 --> 50:50.680
and there's his blog, which is so big,

50:50.730 --> 50:54.040
and hopefully there's even
a book in there, you know?

50:54.090 --> 50:55.870
Oh, that's so awesome.

50:55.920 --> 50:57.790
He has such an amazing legacy.

50:57.840 --> 51:00.730
It's beautiful that you're
helping to keep it alive.

51:00.780 --> 51:03.250
Well, I'm doing everything that I can.

51:03.300 --> 51:05.950
It's so important, especially right now.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.912
There's so much misinformation, you know?

51:08.962 --> 51:09.843
Yeah.

51:11.370 --> 51:13.630
It must be awful for you to see that

51:13.680 --> 51:16.130
in the middle of everything
you're going through.

51:17.070 --> 51:19.660
Um, I don't, I don't know.

51:19.710 --> 51:21.490
It's just stupid people online.

51:21.540 --> 51:22.953
Don't pay attention.

51:23.820 --> 51:26.650
Oh, well, I don't really
think I even could at this point.

51:26.700 --> 51:30.580
Jeremiah was extraordinarily courageous.

51:30.630 --> 51:32.890
All the investigative stuff he was doing,

51:32.940 --> 51:34.383
especially recently?

51:35.250 --> 51:37.300
Uh, yeah.

51:37.350 --> 51:40.870
And I know he was talking
to some intelligence people?

51:40.920 --> 51:41.753
Oh.

51:42.600 --> 51:45.010
Did you know anything about that?

51:45.060 --> 51:48.190
Mm, no, I mean, he
was pretty tightlipped.

51:48.240 --> 51:51.760
He didn't even show me
anything until it was finished

51:51.810 --> 51:54.365
and, you know, he was
like an artist like that.

51:55.680 --> 51:58.240
Sure, that's what made him so good.

51:58.290 --> 52:00.880
But if you see anything when you're going

52:00.930 --> 52:02.890
through his stuff that's direct interaction

52:02.940 --> 52:04.840
with anyone from the government...

52:04.890 --> 52:06.910
I'm sure Mark told you.

52:06.960 --> 52:09.880
Um, no.

52:09.930 --> 52:12.993
Or maybe I, maybe, I don't remember.

52:13.890 --> 52:16.090
Just send it to Mark or my staff.

52:16.140 --> 52:17.110
I'll email you.

52:17.160 --> 52:19.613
Okay, sounds good.

52:20.496 --> 52:21.700
Oh, oh.

52:21.750 --> 52:22.930
Oh god, I'm so sorry.

52:22.980 --> 52:25.660
I'm just a little bit jumpy these days.

52:25.710 --> 52:27.730
No, I should let you go.

52:27.780 --> 52:31.450
Okay, well, seriously,
thank you so, so much again.

52:31.500 --> 52:33.264
I really appreciate this.

52:34.147 --> 52:36.280
Okay, I'm coming.

52:36.330 --> 52:37.720
I'm sorry about that.

52:37.770 --> 52:40.840
Okay, and please just
remember if you see anything,

52:40.890 --> 52:42.190
it could be a legal issue.

52:42.240 --> 52:44.320
They're super strict about that stuff.

52:44.370 --> 52:45.153
Oh, okay.

52:45.203 --> 52:46.151
Yeah, for sure.

52:47.034 --> 52:49.270
Okay, I'll be right there.

52:49.320 --> 52:50.830
I'm so sorry.

52:50.880 --> 52:52.180
Okay, yes, yes, yes.

52:52.230 --> 52:53.063
Bye.

52:55.890 --> 52:57.303
Okay, I'm coming!

52:59.665 --> 53:00.498
Long time, no see.

53:00.548 --> 53:01.450
Oh my gosh!

53:01.500 --> 53:03.273
Mark, what's going on?

53:04.131 --> 53:05.227
Well, nothing.

53:05.277 --> 53:06.060
Oh, I'm sorry.

53:06.110 --> 53:06.893
Am I interrupting?

53:06.943 --> 53:07.734
Oh, no, no, no.

53:07.776 --> 53:09.225
I'm just finishing up my interview.

53:09.275 --> 53:10.058
Okay.

53:10.108 --> 53:11.890
Look, I don't wanna just barge in

53:11.940 --> 53:12.731
on you like this. - Oh, no.

53:12.773 --> 53:13.556
No, not at all.

53:13.606 --> 53:14.493
What's going on?

53:15.780 --> 53:16.780
I feel terrible.

53:16.830 --> 53:18.080
Why, what's?

53:18.960 --> 53:19.930
Your laptop.

53:19.980 --> 53:22.240
Oh, I'm sorry, Jeremiah's laptop.

53:22.290 --> 53:23.530
Oh, come on.

53:23.580 --> 53:25.930
It was just an honest mistake, seriously.

53:25.980 --> 53:28.870
I'm just rushing all the time
from one place to the other,

53:28.920 --> 53:31.660
and sometimes I just, I don't even think.

53:31.710 --> 53:32.501
No, I know.

53:32.543 --> 53:34.720
And seriously, you have been so supportive

53:34.770 --> 53:37.840
that I truly didn't think anything of it.

53:37.890 --> 53:39.730
I just didn't want you to think.

53:39.780 --> 53:42.100
I didn't think, seriously.

53:42.150 --> 53:43.447
You stop thinking!

53:43.497 --> 53:44.928
I already did.

53:44.970 --> 53:47.560
So, that makes me feel so much better.

53:47.610 --> 53:51.010
And, you know, look,
I'm gonna say this again.

53:51.060 --> 53:55.300
If you ever need help
going through his files at all,

53:55.350 --> 53:56.320
please come to me.

53:56.370 --> 53:57.318
That is so sweet.

53:57.360 --> 53:58.143
Thank you.

53:58.193 --> 53:59.028
We have a team of editors,

53:59.070 --> 54:01.000
we have an army of professionals.

54:01.050 --> 54:02.530
We have a whole bunch of equipment.

54:02.580 --> 54:04.210
We can streamline the process.

54:04.260 --> 54:06.640
Get through it all,
get it off of your mind.

54:06.690 --> 54:08.313
What is going on behind you?

54:09.286 --> 54:10.570
Oh, oh my gosh.

54:10.620 --> 54:11.410
I'm so sorry.

54:11.460 --> 54:12.460
Jeremiah?

54:12.510 --> 54:14.950
Oh. - No, daddy.

54:15.000 --> 54:15.903
Remember?

54:17.790 --> 54:19.960
I'm so sorry, can...

54:20.010 --> 54:21.370
I've gotta go. - Okay.

54:21.420 --> 54:22.758
Thanks
so much for stopping by.

54:22.800 --> 54:23.860
I really appreciate it.

54:23.910 --> 54:24.955
Sure.

54:25.005 --> 54:25.788
Bye.

54:25.838 --> 54:27.102
Bye-bye.

54:30.834 --> 54:33.212
What the fuck?

54:33.262 --> 54:34.090
What that is?

54:34.140 --> 54:35.178
Oh. - What am I doing?

54:35.220 --> 54:36.220
No, daddy.

54:36.270 --> 54:37.450
It's okay.

54:37.500 --> 54:39.453
Just, can you go put some clothes on?

54:40.451 --> 54:41.234
I'm sorry.

54:41.284 --> 54:43.540
It's okay, you got me
out of a little pickle there.

54:43.590 --> 54:47.013
And just, if you put some
clothes on, it'll all be fine.

54:54.110 --> 54:56.650
Con-, congresswoman?

54:56.700 --> 54:57.963
Oh, hi.

54:59.010 --> 55:00.640
I am so sorry.

55:00.690 --> 55:02.140
No, I'm sorry.

55:02.190 --> 55:04.210
That was just a lot of knocking.

55:04.260 --> 55:06.460
I wanted to make sure you're okay.

55:06.510 --> 55:07.720
Oh, no, I am totally fine.

55:07.770 --> 55:08.980
Are you okay?

55:09.030 --> 55:11.643
Seriously, you shouldn't have seen that.

55:13.410 --> 55:16.180
Sacrifice, it's not a political question.

55:16.230 --> 55:19.660
It's not about, you know, left and right.

55:19.710 --> 55:21.850
It's about those, you know, who are worthy.

55:21.900 --> 55:23.710
It's older than politics.

55:23.760 --> 55:26.920
It's older than any
nation or any government.

55:26.970 --> 55:28.360
There's this distinction

55:28.410 --> 55:31.000
between the exoteric and the esoteric.

55:31.050 --> 55:33.640
Because, from the outside,

55:33.690 --> 55:35.973
the regular person sees a pandemic.

55:37.050 --> 55:39.910
But the pandemic helped facilitate

55:39.960 --> 55:43.390
the largest transfer of wealth in history.

55:43.440 --> 55:46.960
It announced the rise of a global power.

55:47.010 --> 55:49.570
It spawned new
opportunities for surveillance

55:49.620 --> 55:53.043
and control, and,
ultimately, for sacrifice.

55:53.970 --> 55:57.670
For transcendence for those who are worthy.

55:57.720 --> 55:59.680
I've personally been preparing for,

55:59.730 --> 56:01.630
for decades for this moment.

56:01.680 --> 56:03.580
But we've been preparing since

56:03.630 --> 56:07.180
before the foundations
of the earth were laid.

56:07.230 --> 56:10.930
There was this term the
Ancient Greeks used, "hecatomb,"

56:10.980 --> 56:14.140
where they would sacrifice a hundred oxen.

56:14.190 --> 56:17.800
They gave what they could
give, and the gods honored it

56:17.850 --> 56:19.683
and gave them knowledge.

56:20.580 --> 56:24.190
Every step along the way,
they gave us knowledge,

56:24.240 --> 56:27.190
helped us develop technologically

56:27.240 --> 56:30.400
so we could offer more. Exoterically,

56:30.450 --> 56:33.423
we see the rise and fall of civilizations.

56:34.500 --> 56:38.080
But esoterically, every catastrophe,

56:38.130 --> 56:42.250
every dark age was engineered
by those who are worthy.

56:42.300 --> 56:43.953
It was a sacrifice.

56:45.060 --> 56:49.293
And now we have the
resources to offer them the world.

56:56.190 --> 56:56.981
Wait, wait, where are you going?

56:57.023 --> 56:58.248
Where are you going? - No, I'm coming back.

56:58.290 --> 56:59.073
I'm coming back.

56:59.123 --> 57:01.923
Just as long as the
camera's on, we're safe.

57:02.760 --> 57:03.593
Oh.

57:05.252 --> 57:06.085
Aw.

57:09.840 --> 57:11.809
What?

57:11.859 --> 57:13.150
I'm sorry.

57:13.200 --> 57:14.033
What?

57:15.120 --> 57:16.540
I forget.

57:16.590 --> 57:17.640
What do you forget?

57:19.859 --> 57:21.843
I don't know your husband.

57:22.854 --> 57:25.420
I don't have a husband.

57:25.470 --> 57:26.520
You're not married?

57:27.660 --> 57:28.480
Nope.

57:28.530 --> 57:29.321
You should get married.

57:29.363 --> 57:30.639
Yeah, that's what I said.

57:31.620 --> 57:32.583
What did he say?

57:33.480 --> 57:34.713
He left.

57:36.870 --> 57:37.653
Bastard.

57:37.703 --> 57:38.486
Oh, no, no, no.

57:38.536 --> 57:39.319
Are you excited?

57:39.369 --> 57:40.330
Is it a boy?

57:40.380 --> 57:42.424
Oh, so if it was a girl,
you wouldn't be excited?

57:42.474 --> 57:43.713
No, I'm happy.

57:46.320 --> 57:48.063
I'm gonna name him Jeremiah.

57:52.619 --> 57:54.768
No.

57:54.818 --> 57:55.601
No.

57:55.651 --> 57:56.484
I know.

57:57.567 --> 57:58.863
I'm not alive.

58:00.660 --> 58:01.493
What?

58:03.480 --> 58:04.420
No.

58:04.470 --> 58:06.423
I live my life in a dream.

58:08.700 --> 58:10.870
No. - All, all life

58:10.920 --> 58:15.100
is swimming and dreaming

58:15.150 --> 58:18.010
and then, and then they come

58:18.060 --> 58:19.990
and they eat your memories.

58:20.040 --> 58:21.010
Dad?

58:21.060 --> 58:23.470
They eat and they drink

58:23.520 --> 58:26.380
like big fish and I can't even swim.

58:26.430 --> 58:27.970
Dad, please.

58:28.020 --> 58:29.110
Hey.

58:29.160 --> 58:29.993
Dad?

58:31.440 --> 58:32.523
Hello, dad?

58:33.899 --> 58:35.823
Baby, I'm tired.

58:38.794 --> 58:39.627
I know.

58:40.704 --> 58:41.537
I know, me too.

58:48.720 --> 58:53.720
So, dad's asleep and I am in the mood

58:53.790 --> 58:55.840
for more conspiracy theories.

58:55.890 --> 58:58.060
Because what else am I gonna do tonight,

58:58.110 --> 58:59.500
you know?

58:59.550 --> 59:02.770
Oh, and lucky me, I got another email

59:02.820 --> 59:04.983
from good ole Caesar Green.

59:06.600 --> 59:08.170
Let's see what it says.

59:08.220 --> 59:11.230
This is an interview
with Colonel Larry Moses.

59:11.280 --> 59:13.150
He was an officer in the Air Force

59:13.200 --> 59:16.270
and worked for decades in the CIA.

59:16.320 --> 59:18.820
Larry died a week after we spoke,

59:18.870 --> 59:21.430
a heart attack, despite no previous history

59:21.480 --> 59:22.263
of heart trouble.

59:22.313 --> 59:24.010
I wanted to introduce this

59:24.060 --> 59:25.930
and let my viewers know that

59:25.980 --> 59:28.030
because it makes his
remarks at the beginning

59:28.080 --> 59:31.143
of our discussion so much more powerful.

59:55.770 --> 59:58.030
Colonel Moses, thank you for coming on.

59:58.080 --> 59:59.590
Thank you for having me.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.750
You've been sticking your
neck out for a long time.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.910
I figured you could use some company.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.283
It's courageous of you.

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:09.250
I know a lot of my viewers have been asking

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.810
because I get this question all the time,

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:15.860
but how are you even still alive right now?

01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:21.170
If what you say is true,
there's some very dark forces

01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:24.640
that'll stop at nothing to silence you.

01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:25.840
Oh, I'm a dead man.

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:26.860
You're-?

01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:28.360
I mean that literally.

01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:31.030
I was contacted when
we scheduled the interview

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.500
and informed that should I go on

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:34.330
and reveal what I know,

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.070
I would be dealt with.

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.870
And yet, you still came here.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.763
It's my duty.

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.440
I've got grandkids.

01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:44.260
And if there's gonna be
anything left of this country,

01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:47.020
of this world, someone needs to expose

01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:49.623
what is going on, someone official.

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:52.930
You've been talking about this for years,

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.520
but they can just dismiss you,

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:56.590
call you a conspiracy theorist,

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.660
kick you off the internet.

01:00:58.710 --> 01:01:00.637
They've done all of the above.

01:01:00.687 --> 01:01:02.553
And that's why you're not dead yet.

01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:07.023
So tell us,

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:10.630
what do you have for us, Colonel Moses?

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.640
I spent a lot of time in the CIA

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:16.570
and people have heard of MK Ultra,

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:17.980
mind-control experiments.

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:20.320
All that stuff is common knowledge,

01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:22.934
but it goes so much deeper.

01:01:23.817 --> 01:01:26.590
It's not even the
tippy-tip of the iceberg.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.150
Not even.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.350
You contacted me because of my connection

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.080
between the extraterrestrial and the-

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:35.980
Yes. - Yeah.

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:40.060
Yes, and the connection
to DMT, psychedelics,

01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:42.873
and ultimately, I mean, you were right.

01:01:44.866 --> 01:01:47.020
Human sacrifice, adrenochrome.

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:47.853
That's it.

01:01:47.903 --> 01:01:49.030
That's right.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.680
Children,

01:01:50.730 --> 01:01:51.513
Satanism.

01:01:51.563 --> 01:01:53.080
All of it, yes.

01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:55.030
And you were a part of this.

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:58.450
Firsthand, but we
didn't call it Satanism.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.780
Most of the people working
these operations are good people.

01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:03.910
They think they're
fighting for their country.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:06.160
They think they're doing the right thing.

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:07.990
How can you explain that?

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.540
We're doing what we're told.

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:13.480
It's not just orders from
our direct superiors.

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:15.280
This comes from the president.

01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:17.710
There is a coordinated,
international effort

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.560
to contact these beings.

01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:22.293
And these beings...

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:25.450
elaborate, please.

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.860
I don't know what to call them.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.630
This idea that they're visitors

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:32.230
from another planet is a
total misrepresentation.

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.692
No little green men from Mars?

01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:37.570
There may be little green men,

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.250
but they're not for Mars.

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.280
They've been here as long
as we have, maybe longer.

01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:44.710
The idea that we're the
most intelligent life form

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.200
in the universe is obviously preposterous.

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:48.083
Of course.

01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:50.890
But you pointed out, I think,

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:52.870
that we take for granted that we're

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.820
at the top of the heap on this planet.

01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:57.743
That's right.

01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:02.050
I always like to use
the metaphor of spiders.

01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:03.580
Okay?

01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:05.043
Imagine you're a spider.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.600
Your eyes don't work like ours do.

01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:13.450
Your brain is the size of a pinhead.

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:17.170
But if somehow somebody
could explain to you

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:19.570
that, in spider language,

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:23.050
that there are these things called people

01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:28.090
and they live in these
things called cities,

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.940
and you're in this thing called a pantry,

01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:33.070
you wouldn't believe them.

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.860
They'd call you a conspiracy theorist.

01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:37.023
That's right.

01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:42.190
But if you didn't listen,
you'd still get squished.

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.570
You would.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:44.530
Hm.

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:46.510
But there's a key difference here:

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:49.180
you can't communicate with the spider,

01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:52.420
but these beings want
to communicate with us.

01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:54.190
They want us to know about them?

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.030
Yes.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.080
Why?

01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:58.150
That's the million-dollar question.

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.910
Initially we thought they
were products of hallucination.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.180
We were experimenting
with all kinds of narcotics,

01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:07.570
astral-projection, stopping people's hearts

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:08.770
and reviving them.

01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:12.250
And in recording a lot of
these experiences, we noticed

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:15.813
that the subjects described
seeing these beings.

01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:21.160
But why trust the record of a drug trip?

01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:23.590
Normally we wouldn't,
and we didn't at first

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:26.553
until these beings started
passing along information.

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:31.270
Subjects started spouting
equations and so forth.

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:33.640
These people would come down

01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:35.950
and they'd draw blueprints for technology

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.793
that was way beyond
anything we were capable of.

01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:41.530
And where is all this coming from?

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.110
From them, from these beings.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.550
Sounds pretty noble,

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.640
like they're trying to help us out.

01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:50.470
That's what we thought at first.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.680
But nothing's free with
them, we found that out.

01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:55.120
What do they want?

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:56.003
Gold?

01:04:58.496 --> 01:05:00.127
Blood.

01:05:00.177 --> 01:05:01.710
Adrenalized blood.

01:05:03.362 --> 01:05:04.635
Dad?

01:05:04.685 --> 01:05:05.518
Dad!

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.231
Dad!

01:05:08.151 --> 01:05:09.576
Dad, are you okay?

01:05:36.711 --> 01:05:37.544
Dad?

01:05:39.953 --> 01:05:40.786
Dad?

01:06:06.312 --> 01:06:07.145
Hello?

01:06:08.453 --> 01:06:09.945
I
don't know what's happening.

01:06:09.987 --> 01:06:11.643
Dad just disappeared.

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:18.100
Jeremiah called and said
that the bad guys got him,

01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:20.440
but dad's alive, so that's good.

01:06:20.490 --> 01:06:23.200
It's 10:45 and Jeremiah
said I had to go back

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:26.013
to his apartment to
get a gun, just in case.

01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:29.260
But I've never used
a gun in my entire life.

01:06:29.310 --> 01:06:31.060
And I hate guns and I never thought

01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:32.410
I would have to even touch one.

01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:34.530
But here I am, so.

01:06:35.413 --> 01:06:36.288
This is so much bigger than that.

01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:37.580
I can't think about that.

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.870
Jeremiah said that the
world is about to change

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.993
and I believe him because, look.

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.610
Why is nobody talking about this?

01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:51.250
I turn on the news and nothing.

01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:54.100
Nobody is outside, nobody's freaking out.

01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:55.683
What is happening?

01:06:59.214 --> 01:07:00.400
Adrenalized blood.

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:01.930
From what we could determine,

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.520
these are interdimensional beings,

01:07:03.570 --> 01:07:06.040
and they want to get
their hooks into our world.

01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:09.040
They don't have bodies,
so they're locked out.

01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:11.080
Why do they need blood?

01:07:11.130 --> 01:07:14.350
It's not simple,
but long story short,

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.413
there are spiritual properties in blood.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:21.640
It can be a kind of bridge
between dimensions.

01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:23.890
Between the
spirit world and our world.

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:25.240
You could say that, yeah.

01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:28.570
Mm-hm, which explains why

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:32.703
all these pagan deities
demanded human sacrifices.

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:39.350
But the Abrahamic
religions, they were against it.

01:07:40.170 --> 01:07:43.330
This has been
going on for a very long time.

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:46.000
Since the
dawn of recorded history.

01:07:46.050 --> 01:07:48.520
And there
are certain kinds of blood

01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:52.600
that are considered optimal
to achieve communication.

01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:55.300
To make a more stable bridge?

01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:57.633
Virgins, children.

01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:01.863
And that's why
the gods demanded them.

01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:05.043
And adrenalized blood.

01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:09.520
That's the
other component, yeah.

01:08:09.570 --> 01:08:12.850
It sounds horrible, but
to get all that adrenaline

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:17.900
in the blood, the most
effective way is to induce fear.

01:08:19.007 --> 01:08:21.281
Oh, god, the fuckin' light is on.

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:22.164
Mark!

01:08:23.673 --> 01:08:25.750
Hey, hey, hold on a second.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:26.781
Please, I'm here to help you, okay?

01:08:26.823 --> 01:08:29.110
What the
fuck are you doing here?

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.490
You're in danger.

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:31.338
Get the fuck out right now!

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:33.130
Jeremiah is in danger.

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:34.065
Get his name out of your mouth.

01:08:34.107 --> 01:08:35.350
Oh, come on!

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.900
Listen, I know we don't get along

01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:39.760
and we have differences of opinions,

01:08:39.810 --> 01:08:42.160
but you need to listen to me, okay?

01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:44.410
Jeremiah is being manipulated.

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:45.251
Oh, shut the fuck up!

01:08:45.293 --> 01:08:47.140
And I know that he's still alive.

01:08:47.190 --> 01:08:48.550
Put it down, okay?

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:49.630
Okay, listen.

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:52.750
We're both dead if you don't listen to me.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.220
Oh, yeah? - Okay?

01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:55.182
You first!

01:08:55.232 --> 01:08:56.015
No, no, no, no.

01:08:56.065 --> 01:08:56.856
You're gonna die.

01:08:56.898 --> 01:08:58.360
No, no, no, put that down, please.

01:08:58.410 --> 01:08:59.193
Please, please, please.

01:08:59.243 --> 01:09:00.438
Have you been stalking me?

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:03.263
No, I haven't been stalking you.

01:09:03.313 --> 01:09:05.770
I have contacts in intelligence, okay,

01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:07.265
from the good guys, and

01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:09.700
Okay, listen.

01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:12.951
Jeremiah is being lied to.

01:09:13.001 --> 01:09:16.180
You are being lied to and
we are running out of time.

01:09:16.230 --> 01:09:17.013
Okay?

01:09:17.063 --> 01:09:18.713
So please, please,
please, please believe me.

01:09:18.763 --> 01:09:19.554
Okay, if you do not-

01:09:19.596 --> 01:09:20.890
Just come, just come with me.

01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:22.158
No, I am not coming with you.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.002
Oh, come on!

01:09:23.052 --> 01:09:24.240
I am not coming with you!

01:09:24.282 --> 01:09:25.968
Come on, I'm begging you!

01:09:26.018 --> 01:09:26.801
Okay!

01:09:26.851 --> 01:09:28.768
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:09:31.742 --> 01:09:32.781
Okay.

01:09:32.823 --> 01:09:35.500
So it's 11:45, someone's coming soon.

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:38.560
But I'm really glad that
I turned off all the lights

01:09:38.610 --> 01:09:41.523
and parked far away because look.

01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:43.623
Jeremiah knew.

01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:46.713
He got me to leave to protect me.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:48.833
Oh, shit.

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:52.570
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:53.800
We gotta go quick.

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:56.193
Get the package and the gun, and let's go.

01:10:05.681 --> 01:10:10.681
♪ I got a gun ♪

01:10:11.970 --> 01:10:13.780
Thank you so much.

01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:15.730
Is Jeremiah safe?

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:17.440
And what about my dad?

01:10:17.490 --> 01:10:19.000
Jeremiah's safe.

01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:21.580
We're working on securing your father.

01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:22.930
He's gonna be okay.

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:25.180
Do you see these UFOs?

01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:27.130
Am I going crazy?

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:28.300
You're not crazy.

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:30.130
And you know what?

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:32.470
Is there a space invasion?

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.870
Can you please explain what's happening?

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.490
Are you familiar with Project Blue Beam?

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:38.230
Also, why are there owls?

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.560
This is above top secret,
this is beyond classified.

01:10:41.610 --> 01:10:45.938
Any records, if they ever
existed, have been destroyed.

01:10:45.988 --> 01:10:47.290
Oh, god.

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:49.120
It's just conspiracy theories.

01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:51.010
You only know what you've
seen and what you've read.

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:55.120
Textbooks, newspapers,
the television, the internet,

01:10:55.170 --> 01:10:59.560
it's been increasingly becoming electronic.

01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:01.260
Like Edward Snowden?

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.280
Snowden is just the tip
of the tip of the iceberg.

01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:09.243
If they could do that then, years ago?

01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:14.560
Track your movements,
listen in on your conversations

01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:17.313
to get you buying products and clicking?

01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:22.090
And that was just what
they publicly acknowledged.

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:23.950
How much more advanced are they now?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.073
Oh wait, why are we stopped?

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.990
Do you mean that they can hear my thoughts?

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.483
How about your soul?

01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:38.860
What if the technology isn't human?

01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:41.020
So this is an alien thing?

01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:41.903
Maybe.

01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:43.900
Maybe worse.

01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:47.650
It's in the satellites, it's in
the chem trails, the phones,

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.313
the radio waves, in the tap water.

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:55.120
Wait, this is
just more conspiracy theories.

01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:56.733
Why are we stopped?

01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:01.600
They can shape all your memories

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:05.500
and everything you see, all history.

01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:07.863
A daydream, a nightmare.

01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:11.660
For all you know, you never had a brother.

01:12:13.597 --> 01:12:14.927
What the fuck!

01:12:14.977 --> 01:12:16.400
What is going on!

01:12:16.450 --> 01:12:17.285
Oh my god!

01:12:18.233 --> 01:12:23.041
Shh.

01:12:25.198 --> 01:12:27.615
That was fucking crazy!

01:12:27.665 --> 01:12:28.540
What the fuck!

01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:30.970
Wait, you all knew it was
that Caesar guy, wasn't it?

01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.170
Yeah, it was one of his guys.

01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:33.136
Oh. - It was one of his guys.

01:12:33.178 --> 01:12:34.199
Oh my god, I'm so glad you're okay.

01:12:34.241 --> 01:12:36.300
I am so glad you're okay.

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:38.500
Oh my God, I missed you so much, bro.

01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:40.549
I really never want you to die.

01:12:40.599 --> 01:12:41.413
Wait, hold on.

01:12:41.463 --> 01:12:42.439
Where are we going?

01:12:42.489 --> 01:12:44.020
We're going someplace safe.

01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:46.660
I'm gonna drop you while
I tie up a few loose ends,

01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:47.501
and then I'm gonna get dad

01:12:47.543 --> 01:12:48.588
and I'm gonna bring it back to you.

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:49.930
No, no, no, no, no.

01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:51.400
Wherever you go, I go, bro.

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:54.310
I am not letting you leave me somewhere.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.040
No, you're gonna, you're
gonna just wait on me

01:12:57.090 --> 01:12:59.710
to bring dad back. Tig,
we're winning this shit.

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.810
This shit is about to be over.

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:03.728
It's almost done. The
good guys are winning.

01:13:03.778 --> 01:13:06.139
Yeah, but I
really wanna help you, please.

01:13:06.189 --> 01:13:07.150
You are helping me.

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.800
You're helping me by trusting me.

01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:09.991
Random place?

01:13:10.041 --> 01:13:10.957
How am I supposed... It's safe.

01:13:10.999 --> 01:13:12.310
How am I supposed to know?

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:14.020
Everything has turned out unsafe.

01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:16.000
I thought that my house was safe.

01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:17.500
Nope, not safe.

01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:19.270
Like, I don't understand.

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.860
What am I supposed to believe?

01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:22.891
Please, just let me stay with you, please.

01:13:22.941 --> 01:13:24.400
Shut the fuck up for a second.

01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:25.390
Tig, please.

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.410
I'm sorry, I love you.

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:27.580
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.

01:13:27.630 --> 01:13:28.536
No, I'm sorry.

01:13:28.586 --> 01:13:29.377
I'm a little I know, I know.

01:13:29.419 --> 01:13:30.940
We're just both keyed up, we're tired.

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:31.934
You need to rest.

01:13:31.984 --> 01:13:32.775
Okay. - Alright?

01:13:32.817 --> 01:13:34.810
Trust me, I'm gonna bring dad back.

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:36.670
You don't have to film all of this.

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.373
You should film all of this.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.460
We're gonna be together,
this shit is gonna be over soon.

01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:43.301
Yeah, okay.

01:13:43.343 --> 01:13:44.126
Okay.

01:13:44.176 --> 01:13:45.850
I'm really sorry.

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.550
I know you've been through a lot.

01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:49.777
I didn't mean to annoy you.

01:13:49.827 --> 01:13:50.890
No, you're not annoying me.

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.173
I love you, you're good.

01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:55.068
I'm really, I really didn't-

01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:57.015
No, shh-shh, just.

01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:00.019
I'll, I'll do...

01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:10.263
So I'm here.

01:14:11.850 --> 01:14:13.443
Jeremiah left me out.

01:14:15.210 --> 01:14:16.443
I'm fuckin' pissed.

01:14:17.345 --> 01:14:18.178
Ugh.

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.080
I'm trying to understand it.

01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:27.490
I'm trying to be patient,

01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:31.570
but I just really thought
that he would want me

01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:35.883
at this time, but I
guess not, I don't know.

01:14:42.206 --> 01:14:45.010
He said he'd call me with next steps.

01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:48.143
Whatever that means. Probably
like some unimportant shit.

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.470
Okay.

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.353
Wait.

01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:57.623
Hello?

01:14:59.970 --> 01:15:01.293
Yeah, yeah, it's here.

01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:06.094
Yep.

01:15:06.144 --> 01:15:09.202
Ugh.

01:15:14.730 --> 01:15:15.993
What am I watching?

01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:22.150
You want me to tell you what I'm seeing?

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:23.033
Okay.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.563
There are owls.

01:15:29.970 --> 01:15:34.503
I don't know what that is
supposed to be, exactly.

01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:40.443
Wait a second.

01:15:50.064 --> 01:15:51.790
Um, Jeremiah?

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.380
Can you hold on one second?

01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:55.411
I'm not feeling very well.

01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:58.590
Let me call you back.

01:16:39.002 --> 01:16:40.640
Jeremiah,

01:16:40.690 --> 01:16:43.690
there are people outside with hoods.

01:16:45.206 --> 01:16:47.785
No, I'm not putting you on speakerphone.

01:16:47.835 --> 01:16:48.668
It's loud.

01:16:52.344 --> 01:16:54.594
Yes, of course I trust you.

01:16:56.516 --> 01:16:57.299
Okay.

01:16:57.349 --> 01:16:58.266
Okay, fine.

01:16:59.926 --> 01:17:01.985
Hello, you're on speakerphone.

01:17:02.035 --> 01:17:04.903
Okay, hey, it's over.

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:06.220
We got 'em.

01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:07.660
Special forces are outside.

01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:09.070
The bad guys are gone, okay?

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.920
Alright, three of 'em are
dead, one of 'em got arrested.

01:17:11.970 --> 01:17:15.220
Jeremiah, there are people outside.

01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:16.750
Do you hear me?

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:17.583
They're, they're not-

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:18.424
No, no, no, no, no.

01:17:18.466 --> 01:17:19.409
They're the bad, they have hoods.

01:17:19.451 --> 01:17:20.470
We are outside.

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.803
They almost got you but you're safe now.

01:17:24.801 --> 01:17:26.110
Wait? - You're safe.

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:28.641
Wait, they're at the door.

01:17:28.691 --> 01:17:29.531
They're at the door.

01:17:29.581 --> 01:17:31.531
It's me!
You're Safe! Come out!

01:17:31.581 --> 01:17:32.822
You can come out.

01:17:32.872 --> 01:17:33.655
Come on out.

01:17:33.705 --> 01:17:34.877
Okay, okay, one second.

01:17:34.927 --> 01:17:36.361
Open the door.

01:17:36.411 --> 01:17:40.385
Come on.

01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:44.722
I love you, baby.

01:17:44.772 --> 01:17:46.930
I love you, daddy.

01:17:57.234 --> 01:17:58.693
Baby, what's wrong?

01:17:58.743 --> 01:17:59.526
Jeremiah?

01:17:59.576 --> 01:18:00.535
Jeremiah?

01:18:07.418 --> 01:18:08.383
Baby, what's wrong?

01:18:08.433 --> 01:18:09.616
Hey, what's wrong, what's wrong?

01:18:09.666 --> 01:18:10.587
What's wrong?

01:18:10.637 --> 01:18:11.471
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:18:11.521 --> 01:18:12.530
She's okay.

01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:13.672
Are you okay?

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:14.717
You okay?

01:18:14.767 --> 01:18:17.030
Hey, he's not dead.

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:18.673
Hey!

01:18:18.723 --> 01:18:20.103
Hey, this isn't real.

01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:23.093
This isn't real, okay?

01:18:24.052 --> 01:18:25.671
This is just a dream, remember?

01:18:26.554 --> 01:18:27.970
This whole thing is just a dream.

01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:31.840
Someone's trying to get
you and you can't move.

01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:35.650
You open your mouth and there's nothing.

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:37.203
There's barely a whisper.

01:18:38.121 --> 01:18:39.250
Huh?

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:40.083
Daddy.

01:18:40.133 --> 01:18:42.540
Do you know why you can't scream?

01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:45.940
What?

01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:48.580
Because there's nothing to cry out for.

01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:50.073
There's nothing to mourn.

01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:52.930
All of history is effaced.

01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:54.910
All of history is a palimpsest.

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.690
It's a roll of film, unused and exposed,

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:01.953
baking in the sunlight, not even forgotten.

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:06.908
Listen, Antigone, it was never even there.

01:19:10.949 --> 01:19:12.964
What are you doing to me?

01:19:13.014 --> 01:19:14.236
Shh.

01:19:14.286 --> 01:19:15.546
Antigone?

01:19:15.596 --> 01:19:17.077
Antigone.

01:19:17.127 --> 01:19:19.420
Hey, you are under the influence

01:19:19.470 --> 01:19:22.900
of a very powerful
psychotropic agent right now.

01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:24.280
Okay?

01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:28.660
It is designed to induce fear in you

01:19:28.710 --> 01:19:31.210
and in your unborn child.

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:32.800
Okay?

01:19:32.850 --> 01:19:37.850
If you can understand me, I
want you to listen to my words.

01:19:38.490 --> 01:19:42.130
I am not trying to help you.

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:44.290
Let that sink in.

01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:47.588
I am trying to make it worse.

01:19:49.593 --> 01:19:51.040
Shh, Antigone, hey, hey, hey.

01:19:51.090 --> 01:19:51.873
Look at me.

01:19:51.923 --> 01:19:52.706
Listen, listen, listen.

01:19:52.756 --> 01:19:54.520
I know this is hard, but you have to try.

01:19:54.570 --> 01:19:56.290
Okay, I need you to try.

01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:59.020
This was all theater from moment one,

01:19:59.070 --> 01:20:02.650
beautiful as genocide or the atom bomb,

01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:04.780
or the Great Leap Forward.

01:20:04.830 --> 01:20:06.520
What's a million dead Iraqis?

01:20:06.570 --> 01:20:07.750
Go to the the graves of the ones

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:09.820
that have been buried and dig them up

01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:11.290
and tell me, please, Antigone,

01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:14.500
if you can distinguish their rotting flesh

01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:16.540
from the carrion of beasts.

01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:19.000
They are no bodies, Antigone.

01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:21.880
There is no evidence unless it is captured

01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:26.770
in text or on film. The
atrocity undone in its remaking.

01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:30.640
In its elevation to a fetish,
to a symbol of horror,

01:20:30.690 --> 01:20:33.160
the horror itself is so diminished

01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:34.930
as to be entirely forgotten.

01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:37.720
Eroded, weathered
to a smudge on the palimpsest.

01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:38.860
Barely a smudge.

01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:40.480
She'll feel everything, right?

01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:42.640
Yeah, every sensation is amplified.

01:20:42.690 --> 01:20:43.481
This is basically the
opposite of anesthesia.

01:20:43.523 --> 01:20:44.356
Okay.

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.650
The copy is all that's left.

01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.630
We are led by our lady Babalon

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.670
from the real to the unreal,

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:55.780
from light to darkness,
from death to immortality.

01:20:55.830 --> 01:21:00.190
And I saw a woman
seated on a scarlet beast

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.950
that was full of blasphemous names,

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.980
and it had seven heads and ten horns.

01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:08.800
And the woman was
clothed in purple and scarlet

01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:12.490
and adorned in gold and jewels and pearls.

01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:17.230
And in her hand was a
golden cup full of abominations

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.420
and of the impurities of her fornication.

01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:23.050
And on her forehead was written a name,

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.713
a mystery, Babylon.

01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:27.453
I love you, baby.

01:21:27.503 --> 01:21:30.730
The great mother of whores
and of Earth's abominations.

01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:34.600
And I saw that she was
drunk on the blood of the saints

01:21:34.650 --> 01:21:37.983
and on the blood of the witnesses to Jesus.

01:21:43.257 --> 01:21:44.731
Jeremiah?

01:21:44.781 --> 01:21:45.614
Jeremiah?

01:21:46.684 --> 01:21:47.656
Do it!

01:21:47.706 --> 01:21:48.539
