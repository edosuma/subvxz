Eight hours ago, we monitored
a message from his assistant

00:21.771 --> 00:23.814

I only hope
we can reach him in time.

00:28.778 --> 00:31.613
Nothing, sir.
Not since their initial communication.

00:31.781 --> 00:34.283
They send out a plea for help
and then they cut off transmission

00:34.451 --> 00:36.535

if there's any help on the way.

l'll be damned
if l can find a thing wrong with him.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.925
Perhaps we're looking
in the wrong place.

30:03.092 --> 30:05.594
- Meaning?
- Well, if Data's physical health

30:05.762 --> 30:09.223
is unimpaired, perhaps his mental
health needs to be addressed.

30:10.058 --> 30:12.392
What, are you saying
that Data's losing his mind?

30:13.144 --> 30:16.355
With your permission, captain,
there is one way to find out.

30:19.359 --> 30:23.237
Now, Data, you remember
the psychotronic stability examination.

30:23.404 --> 30:24.488
We all had to take it

30:24.656 --> 30:26.949
before graduating
from the Academy.

30:27.116 --> 30:30.994
lt was a waste of time then
and it's a waste of time now.

30:31.162 --> 30:35.290
lt will just gauge your psychological
reactions to the images it projects.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.167
- Mm-hm.
- Watch the screen

30:37.335 --> 30:39.461

about what's happening to him?

31:28.011 --> 31:30.721
Well, sir, it's just a guess,

31:31.806 --> 31:34.474

to be human so badly,

31:34.642 --> 31:35.684
he can taste it.

31:35.852 --> 31:39.897
l think he just tends to get confused
when his human qualities surface.

31:40.398 --> 31:43.358
- Hmm. Go on.
- Uh, witnessing Graves' death

31:43.526 --> 31:45.986

for the way he...

31:54.120 --> 31:56.121
To be sure of what?

31:56.289 --> 31:59.875
There are two disparate personalities
within Lieutenant Commander Data.

32:01.002 --> 32:04.129
Each distinctly different.
A dominant and a recessive.

32:04.297 --> 32:06.423
But he's an android.
ls that possible?

32:06.591 --> 32:08.133
lt must be.

32:08.301 --> 32:11.553
The dominant personality
is unstable.

32:11.721 --> 32:15.223
Brilliant but vain.
Sensitive yet paranoid.

32:15.391 --> 32:19.227
And l believe it is prone
to irrationality.

32:19.729 --> 32:20.896
Of course.

32:21.064 --> 32:23.941
- Sir?
- Nothing. Go on.

32:25.193 --> 32:29.655
lt seems to have an especially
strong hatred of you, captain.

32:29.822 --> 32:32.658
Or to a lesser degree,
any authority figure.

32:33.368 --> 32:36.828
And the worst part is, it's growing.

32:36.996 --> 32:38.372
How do you mean?

32:38.539 --> 32:41.875
The alien persona is getting stronger

32:42.043 --> 32:45.337

l am alive.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.109
How?

34:35.364 --> 34:37.240
l deactivated Data

34:37.408 --> 34:40.827

into his frame.

34:41.537 --> 34:46.708
l never imagined
how much of myself l would retain.

34:46.876 --> 34:49.544

They won't let you get away with it.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.091
They'll try to stop you.

34:55.468 --> 34:56.718
How can they?

34:56.886 --> 35:00.722
lt is my body now.
lt is out of their hands.

35:00.890 --> 35:03.725
Doctor, tell me, how much time
did Data and Graves spend together?

35:03.893 --> 35:06.728
They were together practically
the entire time we were on the planet.

35:06.896 --> 35:09.773
- Always alone?
- Yes. Always.

35:10.733 --> 35:12.901
Doctor, what was your impression
of Graves?

35:13.069 --> 35:17.656
He seemed brilliant, egocentric,
arrogant, chauvinistic.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.411
Sound familiar?

35:25.289 --> 35:28.542
Something wonderful has happened.

35:29.252 --> 35:33.672

without feeling stabbing pain.

35:34.257 --> 35:37.801

Think of the things l will accomplish
over the next thousand years.

35:44.475 --> 35:45.559
What?

35:45.977 --> 35:47.060
Ah.

35:47.228 --> 35:48.812
Oh...

35:49.188 --> 35:50.772

35:51.899 --> 35:53.692
There is no need to worry.

Yes.

Our memorial service
may have been premature.

37:15.566 --> 37:17.150
What an achievement.

38:56.417 --> 38:58.460
Pathetic.

Without heart,
a man is meaningless.

39:08.304 --> 39:11.014
l would not come up here
if l were you, captain.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.767
l might not like it.

41:32.198 --> 41:34.365
- He is--
- He is different, yes.

41:35.034 --> 41:36.451
But that does not make him
expendable
