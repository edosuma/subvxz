<i>Previously on "Bel-Air"...</i>

00:04.402 --> 00:05.903
<i>My pieces, they have
something powerful to say.</i>

00:06.003 --> 00:08.866
<i>If this is unbecoming
of the Neeman Fellowship,</i>

00:08.966 --> 00:10.908
<i>then so am I.</i>

00:13.931 --> 00:15.273
<i>You don't get
to say "nigger."</i>

00:15.373 --> 00:16.514
<i>None of y'all do.</i>

00:16.614 --> 00:17.715
<i>Well, I'm pretty sure
I just said it.</i>

00:17.815 --> 00:19.237
I did not send the video.

00:19.337 --> 00:20.718
I can't even believe
you would accuse me of that.

00:20.818 --> 00:22.640
You had me and Carlton out
here beefing when it was you.

00:22.740 --> 00:24.362
Oh, but can you prove it, though?

00:24.462 --> 00:26.284
We'd like to bring you in
as an equity partner.

00:26.384 --> 00:27.725
You can create
whatever future

00:27.825 --> 00:29.047
you envision for yourself.

00:29.147 --> 00:30.568
So are you seriously
considering this?

00:30.668 --> 00:32.130
I think I have to.

00:32.230 --> 00:33.931
But Doc told me not
to count myself out.

00:34.031 --> 00:35.133
At least he believes in me.

00:35.233 --> 00:36.614
We'll see how much
Doc still believes in you

00:36.714 --> 00:38.977
when I stop putting money in
his bank account every month.

00:39.077 --> 00:40.658
- Let go of me!
- Relax.

00:40.758 --> 00:42.760
You don't know shit
about me, Will.

00:45.523 --> 00:46.824
It's not gonna work
for me anymore, Will.

00:46.924 --> 00:49.347
- So what are you saying?
- We can't be friends anymore.

00:49.447 --> 00:51.469
The school is claiming
one of your classmates

00:51.569 --> 00:52.991
<i>told her parents
they saw Ms. Hughes</i>

00:53.091 --> 00:54.352
<i>giving books
that weren't a part</i>

00:54.452 --> 00:56.114
<i>of the approved curriculum.</i>

00:56.214 --> 00:57.155
I can't do this anymore.

00:57.255 --> 00:59.117
So this is how it ends?

00:59.217 --> 01:00.718
I guess so.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.724
OK, how's this?

01:06.824 --> 01:10.088
"And while my comments were
in no way meant to tarnish

01:10.188 --> 01:12.650
"the reputation
of the Neeman Fellowship,

01:12.750 --> 01:16.734
"I do wholeheartedly stand
by my opinions and apologise

01:16.834 --> 01:20.658
for any harm I may have
caused the organisation."

01:20.758 --> 01:22.660
It's good that you're
standing by your principles.

01:22.760 --> 01:24.302
You shouldn't have
to apologise for talking

01:24.402 --> 01:25.623
about what you believe in.

01:25.723 --> 01:27.185
Yeah, I mean,
what's the worst they can do,

01:27.285 --> 01:28.786
cancel your fellowship?

01:28.886 --> 01:30.348
You think they could do that?

01:30.448 --> 01:31.589
- It's not gonna happen.
- Good morning.

01:31.689 --> 01:32.830
- Morning, Dad.
- Morning, Phil.

01:32.930 --> 01:35.113
OK, gotta get going, y'all.

01:35.213 --> 01:36.354
I don't wanna be late
to the gym.

01:36.454 --> 01:38.196
So I walk in a room,
and you walk out.

01:38.296 --> 01:39.997
How long are we gonna do this?
- I'm cool.

01:40.097 --> 01:43.521
Yeah, well, I'm not.

01:43.621 --> 01:47.145
Come on, your violin lesson's
starting soon.

01:50.148 --> 01:51.889
You know, when you
came back in this house,

01:51.989 --> 01:54.212
you wanted more independence.

01:54.312 --> 01:57.255
And I promised to support that.

01:57.355 --> 02:00.378
But if that support
is feeling more like control,

02:00.478 --> 02:02.860
then I'm gonna ease up.

02:02.960 --> 02:06.424
Yeah, so from now on,
I'm gonna let you decide

02:06.524 --> 02:08.526
when you need my help.

02:13.691 --> 02:15.993
That's all I wanted, just
a little bit of space to do me.

02:16.093 --> 02:17.034
Then you got it.

02:17.134 --> 02:18.276
You're
in the driver's seat now.

02:18.376 --> 02:21.679
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

02:21.779 --> 02:23.841
Oh, hallelujah.

02:23.941 --> 02:25.883
And I know you got your first
game with Zenith Hype later.

02:25.983 --> 02:27.405
Geoffrey and I will
be front and centre.

02:27.505 --> 02:28.926
You know I would
be there if it wasn't

02:29.026 --> 02:30.408
for this Neeman meeting.

02:30.508 --> 02:32.290
It's all good.
Just catch the highlight reel.

02:32.390 --> 02:34.592
You know I'm gonna
drop 30 on them.

02:37.555 --> 02:39.857
I really gotta
get out of here.

02:39.957 --> 02:41.979
I guess two reconciliations
in one day

02:42.079 --> 02:43.381
is too much to ask for, huh?

02:43.481 --> 02:44.582
Well, it helps to start
with an apology.

02:44.682 --> 02:46.184
Oh, wow.
You're taking his side.

02:46.284 --> 02:48.446
How unexpected.

02:55.172 --> 02:57.475
You OK, son?

02:57.575 --> 02:59.717
Yeah, it's just a nosebleed.

02:59.817 --> 03:00.878
The air's just super dry.

03:00.978 --> 03:02.440
Well, do you want me
to get you a tissue?

03:02.540 --> 03:03.921
No, no, no, no, I got it.
It's fine.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.263
thanks for getting me home
the other night.

03:25.363 --> 03:28.506
I know I got
a little out of pocket.

03:28.606 --> 03:31.389
I'm not even sure what I said.

03:31.489 --> 03:32.950
I can remember a few things.

03:33.050 --> 03:35.393
Mm.

03:35.493 --> 03:38.236

- It's all good.

We all got something
we're going through.

03:40.338 --> 03:42.640
I get it.

03:42.740 --> 03:45.323
I'm ready to share
a little bit more,

03:45.423 --> 03:48.326
if you're still interested.

03:48.426 --> 03:50.328

03:50.428 --> 03:53.090
Well, I'm definitely
still interested.

not on the team anymore?

04:10.087 --> 04:12.770
Can't get a straight answer
from anybody.

04:14.091 --> 04:17.515
Yeah, let's--
let's talk about that too.

04:17.615 --> 04:19.997

- Big things, baby.
- What's up, Coach?

04:28.225 --> 04:30.408
- Ready to do it?
- Yes, sir.

04:33.471 --> 04:35.012
What was that about?

04:35.112 --> 04:37.134
He's just excited
to be starting in the game.

You ruled in Philly.

07:22.239 --> 07:24.021

07:24.121 --> 07:25.823
But Simply Spiked
and those posts with LaMarcus

a team, and we did that.

No, it's just us
as heads of the board.

11:00.577 --> 11:04.141
We felt what we have to say
is best said in private.

11:15.432 --> 11:19.777
Look, I know that
my comments were harsh.

11:19.877 --> 11:23.500
Antiquated,
conservative, out of touch,

11:23.600 --> 11:24.902
those were your words.

11:25.002 --> 11:27.745
Sometimes
the truth is hard to hear.

11:27.845 --> 11:29.186
The truth?

11:29.286 --> 11:32.630
Your IG presence
has already opened up

11:32.730 --> 11:34.992
a wider and younger audience.

11:35.092 --> 11:39.396
We know Janice's criticisms
have been stifling,

11:39.496 --> 11:41.879
but she doesn't speak
for all of us.

11:41.979 --> 11:45.482
We see you as the future.

11:45.582 --> 11:50.287
Wait, so you're not here
to strip me of the fellowship?

11:50.387 --> 11:51.608
No.

11:51.708 --> 11:55.332
We want to offer you the
executive director position.

11:55.432 --> 11:59.256
But isn't that
Janice's title?

11:59.356 --> 12:00.738
Yes.

12:00.838 --> 12:02.259
It's time for a change.

12:02.359 --> 12:04.802
And it's yours if you want it.

12:07.925 --> 12:10.067
Will put
the Philly heat on them.

12:10.167 --> 12:11.789
Listen, that boy can play.

12:11.889 --> 12:13.390
Yeah,
I'm really proud of him.

12:13.490 --> 12:15.392
He'--he's amazing.

12:15.492 --> 12:17.474
Hold up.

12:22.579 --> 12:24.842
I wonder what that's about.

12:24.942 --> 12:27.685
Huh?
- I'll look into it.

12:27.785 --> 12:29.987
I'm out.

12:33.390 --> 12:34.531
Thanks for your help, Lisa.

12:34.631 --> 12:36.213
You let me know how
that test goes, OK?

12:36.313 --> 12:41.218
Will do.

12:41.318 --> 12:43.100
Hey.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.622
Hey, you're here early.

12:45.722 --> 12:47.865
Yeah, well, I knew
that you'd be tutoring,

12:47.965 --> 12:50.908
and I wanted to catch
you before class.

12:51.008 --> 12:53.030
For you.

12:55.893 --> 12:57.514
A swimmer charm?

12:57.614 --> 12:59.717
This is beautiful.

12:59.817 --> 13:01.478
But what's the occasion?

13:01.578 --> 13:04.401
Well, I'm still
in the Founder's Award race.

13:04.501 --> 13:09.006
Because what you said tapped
into what people want to hear.

13:09.106 --> 13:12.850
Well, and you're
always the one

13:12.950 --> 13:16.373
encouraging me
to speak my truth.

13:16.473 --> 13:19.737
And no matter who's against me,
you always have my back.

13:19.837 --> 13:21.378
I'll always be there for you.

13:21.478 --> 13:22.900
You know that.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.264
I just wanted to show you
how much I appreciate you, Lis.

13:27.364 --> 13:28.705
You mean the world to me,
and I don't know

13:28.805 --> 13:31.749
what I'd do without you.

13:31.849 --> 13:33.430
Thanks.

13:38.415 --> 13:40.277
All right,
I'll catch you later.

13:40.377 --> 13:41.959
Thanks.

13:50.387 --> 13:52.489
Yeah, that's good.
Thank you.

13:52.589 --> 13:56.774
Hey, look what I got,
vintage 1964.

13:56.874 --> 13:58.655
- Oh, come on now.
- Mm-hmm.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.257
Oh, I can hear Derek now.

14:00.357 --> 14:01.698
"Black folks
didn't get full rights

14:01.798 --> 14:03.260
under the law until 1964."

14:03.360 --> 14:04.701
"That's why
it's the only vintage

14:04.801 --> 14:06.583
we're gonna drink every year."

14:06.683 --> 14:08.946
That's right.

14:09.046 --> 14:11.188
I wish you were
still here, brother.

14:11.288 --> 14:14.191
Yeah, me too.

14:16.373 --> 14:18.395
You know,
about the Garrison account--

14:18.495 --> 14:19.596
No, no, no, no.

14:19.696 --> 14:22.599
Today is about memory
and celebration only.

14:22.699 --> 14:24.561
Today is about Derek.

14:24.661 --> 14:26.443
Right, right,
but you still think

14:26.543 --> 14:30.327
that this tribute
is a good idea

14:30.427 --> 14:32.129
given all the acquisition talk?

14:32.229 --> 14:33.770
Yeah, I mean, even more so.

14:33.870 --> 14:35.492
We've got to remind people
why me, you, and Derek

14:35.592 --> 14:37.254
started the firm
in the first place, right?

14:37.354 --> 14:39.016
I think they need
to hear from us.

14:39.116 --> 14:41.418
No, they need
to hear from you, Phil.

14:41.518 --> 14:43.901
And I need
to empty this bottle.

14:52.049 --> 14:55.152
Hey, Lis. Hold up.

14:55.252 --> 14:56.954
So how was class?

15:04.021 --> 15:07.124
Yo, C.

15:07.224 --> 15:09.126
Listen, man, we got to talk.

15:09.226 --> 15:10.687
We're doing that now, huh?

15:10.787 --> 15:14.611
No, no, no, but it's--
this is important.

15:14.711 --> 15:17.855
Look, Drew is the one who
leaked the locker room video.

15:17.955 --> 15:19.376
What?

15:19.476 --> 15:21.138
Yes, he basically admitted
it straight to my face.

15:21.238 --> 15:22.379
And the only reason
I'm telling you

15:22.479 --> 15:25.462
is because him and Lisa
are linked up right now.

15:25.562 --> 15:28.225
What--I thought
she was done with him.

15:28.325 --> 15:29.626
No, man, I guess
she gave him a second chance.

15:29.726 --> 15:30.747
I just saw them together.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.310
Look, man, you got
to tell her what's up.

15:33.410 --> 15:35.632
- Me?
- Yes.

15:35.732 --> 15:37.634
Me and Lisa, we're not
on good terms right now.

15:37.734 --> 15:39.276
You know?

15:39.376 --> 15:40.998
If I tell her, it will look
like I'm being a hater,

15:41.098 --> 15:43.840
but you guys are friends, OK?

15:43.940 --> 15:46.123
She's got to know what type
of guy she's fucking with.

15:46.223 --> 15:47.324
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:47.424 --> 15:49.686
Yeah, I'll talk to her.

15:49.786 --> 15:51.768
Good, see you later.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.411
Uh, hey, look, Will.

15:54.511 --> 15:58.575
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

16:01.958 --> 16:04.021
That's not worth shit.

16:16.373 --> 16:20.717
To the Neeman Fellowship's
next executive director.

16:20.817 --> 16:23.760
OK, I have not accepted
the position yet.

16:23.860 --> 16:26.723
Oh, you could do whatever
you want with it now.

16:26.823 --> 16:29.806
I mean, you could carve out
some time for your own artwork

16:29.906 --> 16:31.808
and help new talent.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.451
<i>♪ No place

16:34.551 --> 16:36.173
Now, why aren't
you more excited?

16:36.273 --> 16:37.894
It's Janice.

16:37.994 --> 16:41.298
It's not like she's a friend,
but I feel like

16:41.398 --> 16:44.421
I'm stabbing a sister
in the back.

16:44.521 --> 16:46.944
OK, look,
I respect what Janice

16:47.044 --> 16:48.905
has done in the art world.

16:49.005 --> 16:50.627
But let's just be honest here.

16:50.727 --> 16:54.151
I mean, she should have
retired a long time ago.

16:54.251 --> 16:55.632
I mean, somebody's
going to get that job.

16:55.732 --> 16:56.994
Why not you?

16:57.094 --> 17:00.237
I just need to think
about it a bit more, I guess.

17:00.337 --> 17:01.838
OK, that's fair.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.601
I mean, let's just
not talk about Janice.

17:04.701 --> 17:07.884
Let's talk about the real
reason why I came over.

17:09.546 --> 17:13.730
Erika Baker is in LA.
So what's the plan?

17:13.830 --> 17:15.772
We gon' track that bitch down,
key her car,

17:15.872 --> 17:16.893
and slash her tires?

17:16.993 --> 17:18.255
OK, stop it.

17:18.355 --> 17:20.057
She still owes me
$20 in gas money.

17:20.157 --> 17:23.060
I have not forgotten.
- We're not in college anymore.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.662
And after what
she's done to you?

17:25.762 --> 17:27.344
That's just water
under the bridge?

17:29.526 --> 17:33.330
We are grown
and sophisticated women.

17:34.731 --> 17:36.073
Fine.

17:36.173 --> 17:37.874
I mean, you want
to take the high road.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.517
I mean, it's boring, but OK.

17:40.617 --> 17:43.200
Look, she and Phil have
a professional connection now.

17:43.300 --> 17:47.004
And I'm trying to give him
the space to just work it out.

17:47.104 --> 17:49.246
Hmm.

17:49.346 --> 17:51.928
What I see is,
you are trying to be

17:52.028 --> 17:57.574
considerate of everyone else,
I mean, Janice, Erika, Phil.

17:57.674 --> 17:59.416
And while you're
so busy putting

17:59.516 --> 18:03.940
everyone else's feelings first,
who's dealing with yours?

18:04.040 --> 18:06.103
Hmm?

18:09.366 --> 18:12.149
For your project,
each team will build

18:12.249 --> 18:16.113
a functional robot capable
of completing three tasks.

18:16.213 --> 18:18.115
You all can pick
whatever tasks those are.

18:18.215 --> 18:20.277
The teams will be as follows:

18:20.377 --> 18:24.321
Madison and Sophia,
Luke and Kaya,

18:24.421 --> 18:26.883
Ashley and Olivia...

18:29.065 --> 18:31.328
Mason and Justin,

Akasha and Laila,
Jim and Fred.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.821
It's not put together yet.

18:44.921 --> 18:47.504
Just moved in a week ago;
all I need is some furniture

18:47.604 --> 18:50.947
and a woman's touch.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.989
I remember your first place
in Santa Monica,

18:53.089 --> 18:54.351
the townhouse.

18:54.451 --> 18:56.633
I bought it
with my rookie signing bonus.

18:56.733 --> 18:59.356
Mm-hmm, and you could
not stop smiling.

18:59.456 --> 19:01.037
Kind of like now.

19:03.540 --> 19:05.722
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- You up for a dip?

19:05.822 --> 19:08.405
I know your ass still
look good in a bikini.

19:08.505 --> 19:10.847
I'm here for business.

19:10.947 --> 19:12.369
All right, cool.

19:12.469 --> 19:14.631
We could start with that.

19:16.673 --> 19:19.576
OK, so I'm looking to get
more engagement for the house.

19:19.676 --> 19:21.698
And I have some football
cross-promotion ideas.

19:21.798 --> 19:23.460
I would love to talk
to you about them.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.742
Look at you being a boss.

19:25.842 --> 19:28.865
Well, it's no billboard
on Sunset, but I'm trying.

19:28.965 --> 19:30.267

19:30.367 --> 19:31.748
Yeah,
my business partner, Ivy,

19:31.848 --> 19:33.710
she has product lines
and merch.

19:33.810 --> 19:35.312

that they're gonna

19:35.412 --> 19:36.753
give her some billboard
on Sunset

19:36.853 --> 19:39.916
for her nasty-ass water, H2Ivy.

19:40.016 --> 19:42.239
Gotcha, OK.

19:42.339 --> 19:44.441
So how can I help?

19:44.541 --> 19:46.723
So I created
a business strategy.

19:46.823 --> 19:49.406
If you like it,
maybe you can connect me

19:49.506 --> 19:52.249
with your marketing people?

19:52.349 --> 19:53.650
Done.

19:53.750 --> 19:55.572
Wait, don't you want
to look at it first?

19:55.672 --> 20:00.457
They're your ideas, so I
already know it's brilliant.

20:00.557 --> 20:03.540
Yo, Gerry, it's LaMarcus Alton.

20:03.640 --> 20:05.822
Hey, you got a minute?

20:08.845 --> 20:12.909
When James, Derek, and I
decided to start this firm,

20:13.009 --> 20:16.913
we made a pact that we would
watch out for each other

20:17.013 --> 20:20.357
and that we were gonna
change the world.

20:20.457 --> 20:24.040
We made a promise that we were
gonna kick down those doors

20:24.140 --> 20:25.442
that were closed to us,

20:25.542 --> 20:28.925
so that the next generation
wouldn't have to.

20:29.025 --> 20:33.129
Not everyone wanted to see
three brothers succeed.

20:35.472 --> 20:37.093
We alternated paying
our mortgages

20:37.193 --> 20:38.295
just to keep this place afloat.

20:38.395 --> 20:39.776
Mm-hmm.

20:39.876 --> 20:42.819
So when we lost Derek
to a massive heart attack,

20:42.919 --> 20:44.741
we thought that might
be the end of the firm.

20:44.841 --> 20:47.824
But we fought harder, because
we know that our brother

20:47.924 --> 20:49.786
would have wanted us
to run this race,

20:49.886 --> 20:51.908
even though he couldn't
be here to cross

20:52.008 --> 20:53.310
the finish line with us.

20:53.410 --> 20:55.432
Which is why we gather here
every year in his name,

20:55.532 --> 20:57.594
to recognise
the day of his passing

20:57.694 --> 21:02.719
and pay tribute to how far
we've all come together.

21:02.819 --> 21:04.321
To Derek.
- To Derek.

21:04.421 --> 21:06.323
all: To Derek.

21:38.134 --> 21:38.995
I'll catch you later.

21:39.095 --> 21:41.598
See ya.

21:41.698 --> 21:44.060
Were you ever gonna
tell me about you and Drew?

21:47.023 --> 21:48.485
People change.

21:48.585 --> 21:50.206
You should know that
better than anyone.

21:50.306 --> 21:53.009
- He's not who you think he is.
- What's that supposed to mean?

21:53.109 --> 21:54.931
He's the one that airdropped
the locker room video of me.

21:55.031 --> 21:56.693
What?
That's ridiculous.

21:56.793 --> 21:57.534
Is it?

21:57.634 --> 21:59.175
Ever since I came to the BSU,

21:59.275 --> 22:01.258
the dude's been trying
to ruin my fucking life.

22:01.358 --> 22:02.619
Carlton, stop.

22:02.719 --> 22:04.140
Why are you defending him?

22:04.240 --> 22:07.864
Because I think
I know what this is about.

22:07.964 --> 22:10.146
If I led you to believe
that we were anything

22:10.246 --> 22:12.589
more than friends, I'm sorry.

22:12.689 --> 22:16.853
But that is all
that we will ever be.

22:19.295 --> 22:23.059
No, I'm sorry.

22:23.860 --> 22:25.882
I'm sorry you're so desperate
to get over Will

22:25.982 --> 22:27.524
that you're willing
to jump the first asshole

22:27.624 --> 22:29.406
that pays you any attention.

22:34.070 --> 22:35.652

23:23.880 --> 23:26.543
What happened to,

23:26.643 --> 23:29.466
What can I say?
You know me.

23:29.566 --> 23:33.350
I knew you could use it.

23:33.450 --> 23:35.852
I could use a little more.

23:39.776 --> 23:41.718
All right, follow me.

23:57.994 --> 24:01.378
Come on.

24:01.478 --> 24:04.320
Let's go.

24:05.682 --> 24:08.585
Hey, you need some help?

24:08.685 --> 24:09.906
No, thanks.

24:10.006 --> 24:11.307
Are you sure?

24:11.407 --> 24:13.149
I've been driving
my dad's car.

24:13.249 --> 24:15.872
I don't--he was
supposed to take it

24:15.972 --> 24:17.394
in the shop, and he didn't.

24:17.494 --> 24:18.595
And now I'm stuck.

24:18.695 --> 24:20.717
Well, I could, uh...

24:20.817 --> 24:22.078
give you a ride home
if you want.

24:22.178 --> 24:23.720
I'm not going home.

24:23.820 --> 24:25.882
I'm going to the hospital.

24:25.982 --> 24:27.323
Angela's in labor.

24:27.423 --> 24:30.006
- Shit, like right now?
- Yes.

24:30.106 --> 24:31.167
Well, come on.
I can give you a ride.

24:31.267 --> 24:32.368
I'm good.

24:32.468 --> 24:33.570
Lisa, I'm not just
gonna let you sit here.

24:33.670 --> 24:35.672
I said I'm fine, Will.

24:38.915 --> 24:41.798
OK.

24:43.640 --> 24:45.502
I'm fine. I'm fine.

25:03.059 --> 25:04.240
You're late.

25:04.340 --> 25:06.763
I wasn't even sure
you'd show.

25:06.863 --> 25:10.406
I think we should make
a robot that sorts recyclables.

25:10.506 --> 25:14.771
I was thinking a cleaning
robot that sweeps floors.

25:14.871 --> 25:18.114
Let's just see
what parts we have.

25:21.037 --> 25:24.300
So have you talked to her?

25:24.400 --> 25:25.421
Who?

25:25.521 --> 25:27.383
Mrs. Hughes.

25:27.483 --> 25:28.785
Why do you care?

25:28.885 --> 25:31.868
She was
my favourite teacher too.

25:31.968 --> 25:33.950
Then why'd you snitch on her?

25:34.050 --> 25:36.072
I would never do that.

25:36.172 --> 25:40.156
It wasn't me.
- It wasn't?

25:40.256 --> 25:42.438
I used to be her favourite,

25:42.538 --> 25:45.762
so I was a little jealous that
she was giving you attention.

25:45.862 --> 25:47.363
That's all.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.846
Oh, my bad.

25:49.946 --> 25:51.888
I shouldn't have jumped
to conclusions.

25:51.988 --> 25:53.930
I guess that makes two of us.

25:54.030 --> 25:57.053
I thought you were
a stuck-up mean girl.

25:57.153 --> 25:59.776
That's not me at all.

25:59.876 --> 26:02.258
I'm just kind of shy.

26:02.358 --> 26:05.441
I get that.
I am too.

26:08.524 --> 26:10.907
The cleaning robot
seems good.

26:11.007 --> 26:12.829
Maybe it will clean my room
for me.

26:12.929 --> 26:14.711
Yeah.

26:24.260 --> 26:26.963
So these are
your new friends now?

26:27.063 --> 26:28.244
You jealous?

26:28.344 --> 26:30.166
We met at a girl's pool party.

26:30.266 --> 26:31.968
We hang out every now and then.

26:32.068 --> 26:33.129
Yo, I left
all my shit in the car,

26:33.229 --> 26:34.290
so let's just get in
and get out.

26:34.390 --> 26:37.534
OK, they said,
"Come on in now."

26:43.720 --> 26:46.743
<i>♪ They want the sound,

26:48.885 --> 26:50.627

27:05.982 --> 27:07.403
Let's party.

27:07.503 --> 27:08.885
Actually,
we weren't gonna stay.

27:08.985 --> 27:11.728
We were--
- Well, I mean, why not?

27:11.828 --> 27:13.690
- Yeah.
- Why not?

27:13.790 --> 27:16.853
<i>♪ So line 'em up,

27:18.514 --> 27:20.336
You were right.

27:20.436 --> 27:22.018
I'm glad we did this today.

27:22.118 --> 27:24.100
It felt good.

27:24.200 --> 27:28.544
Well, as usual,
everyone responds to you.

27:28.644 --> 27:32.148
I hope we made
our brother Derek proud.

27:32.248 --> 27:33.590
I'm sure he would
have had a lot to say

27:33.690 --> 27:37.994
about that fake-ass tribute.

27:38.094 --> 27:40.156
I just got
an interesting call.

27:40.256 --> 27:42.879
You know, our law world
is small, Phil.

27:42.979 --> 27:46.002
And the Black one's
even smaller.

27:46.102 --> 27:49.085
What, did you think
I wasn't gonna find out?

27:49.185 --> 27:51.487
My meeting
with Carson & Lake.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.409
Yeah, you called me out
about having a secret meeting.

27:53.509 --> 27:56.132
And it seems like you've
been having some of your own.

27:56.232 --> 27:58.735
It's an old friend,
Erika Baker.

27:58.835 --> 28:00.897
She's a partner there.

28:00.997 --> 28:03.099
Damn, Phil.

28:03.199 --> 28:04.260
I mean, brother,
you're a big part

28:04.360 --> 28:05.702
of why we're in this position.

28:05.802 --> 28:07.263
Now you're just going to bail
and look out for yourself?

28:07.363 --> 28:08.384
She asked me to come in.
All right?

28:08.484 --> 28:09.786
It was just an introduction
to the team.

28:09.886 --> 28:12.508
OK, so, you're not
considering a real offer?

28:20.136 --> 28:21.958
Well, congratulations.

28:22.058 --> 28:24.120
You just fooled everyone
into thinking

28:24.220 --> 28:26.562
that you still care
about this place.

28:38.274 --> 28:40.056
You didn't
have to come inside.

28:40.156 --> 28:41.337
Yeah, well,
it didn't seem like you

28:41.437 --> 28:43.760
wanted to walk in alone, so...

28:46.042 --> 28:48.304
A baby brother.

28:48.404 --> 28:49.946
That's cool, right?

28:50.046 --> 28:52.548
I don't know.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.811
It's weird.

28:56.372 --> 29:01.758
My dad's rebuilt a new life,
a new wife, a new baby.

29:01.858 --> 29:07.043
It's like I'm on the outside

29:07.143 --> 29:12.268
watching a whole other family
spring up that isn't mine.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.676
Um...

29:23.759 --> 29:25.581
You know what?

29:25.681 --> 29:27.683
It's cool.

29:29.125 --> 29:31.407
I can hang.

29:34.690 --> 29:37.573
Come in.

29:41.017 --> 29:44.320
Viv, wow, what a surprise.

29:44.420 --> 29:46.202
God, it's--
it's been forever.

29:46.302 --> 29:47.884
Wow, you look fantastic.

29:47.984 --> 29:51.107
Oh, are we really
gonna play that game?

29:54.710 --> 29:57.013
I assume you want to talk
about Phil's opportunity here.

29:57.113 --> 29:58.935
If Phil's gonna
take a job here,

29:59.035 --> 30:01.037
we need to have
a come to Jesus.

30:05.481 --> 30:06.903
I was thinking about Mom,
and the car wouldn't start

30:07.003 --> 30:09.145
and Will came, and now your car
is stranded at school.

30:09.245 --> 30:11.707
Hey, hey, don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

30:11.807 --> 30:13.830
Today is supposed
to be a happy occasion.

30:13.930 --> 30:15.551
Yeah, for you and Angela.

30:15.651 --> 30:17.073
And you.

30:17.173 --> 30:19.155
We're all family, sweetheart.

30:19.255 --> 30:20.436
It doesn't matter.

30:20.536 --> 30:22.238
We don't even need
to talk about this now.

30:22.338 --> 30:23.479
You have other priorities.

30:23.579 --> 30:26.282
Lisa, you are my priority.

30:26.382 --> 30:29.285
Almost time to push.

30:29.385 --> 30:32.468
We'll finish this.
I promise.

30:42.879 --> 30:45.281

31:29.245 --> 31:30.987
Look.

31:31.087 --> 31:32.148
Oh!

31:32.248 --> 31:34.390
Oh, my gosh!

31:34.490 --> 31:36.232
What am I seeing right now?

31:36.332 --> 31:37.914
Well, I don't know
about this Ivy chick,

31:38.014 --> 31:41.838
but Hilary Banks deserves
her own billboard on Sunset.

31:41.938 --> 31:43.559
I...

31:43.659 --> 31:45.361
I...

31:45.461 --> 31:47.603
I don't even know what to say.

31:47.703 --> 31:51.207
Look, all I need you
to do is just listen

31:51.307 --> 31:53.930
so I can get this out.

31:55.751 --> 32:01.417
I know I said I'm here
to just be friends, but...

32:01.517 --> 32:05.341
as soon as I saw you, I--

32:05.441 --> 32:06.622
there was no question.

32:06.722 --> 32:08.144
I want you back.

32:08.244 --> 32:09.745
Like, I miss you.

32:09.845 --> 32:12.628
And I know you got a man,
so I don't mean any disrespect.

32:12.728 --> 32:16.873
But I hope he's coming correct.

32:16.973 --> 32:22.158
Because I know I am
for as long as it takes.

32:24.340 --> 32:27.443
I'm not losing you again.

32:29.305 --> 32:32.608
I think you just left me
speechless twice in one day.

32:32.708 --> 32:34.850
Well, then I'm off
to a good start.

32:34.950 --> 32:37.573
Thank you.

32:37.673 --> 32:40.576
All right, let me take a
photo of you in front of you.

32:40.676 --> 32:43.779
OK.

32:43.879 --> 32:45.141
Let's go. Come on.

32:47.803 --> 32:51.267
Hey, sorry to break
the news, brother,

32:51.367 --> 32:53.269
but you're stuck with me.

32:53.369 --> 32:55.671
What does that mean?

32:55.771 --> 33:00.116
Well, today,
remembering our history,

33:00.216 --> 33:02.858
seeing what we built...

33:04.780 --> 33:08.724
I'm always going to do what's
best for our firm's future.

33:08.824 --> 33:11.487
I promise.

33:11.587 --> 33:14.830
So no more secret meetings
for either of us?

33:16.592 --> 33:21.497
From now on,
it's just you and me.

33:24.960 --> 33:27.143
We'll take a look at
the terms of this acquisition,

33:27.243 --> 33:31.467
and we'll work it out.

33:34.610 --> 33:37.954
No matter what,

33:38.054 --> 33:41.597
I'm on your side.

33:41.697 --> 33:44.240
We started this together.

33:48.384 --> 33:50.806
Let's finish it together.

33:50.906 --> 33:53.129
Yeah.

33:59.195 --> 34:03.299
All these years, our history,
why didn't you come to me?

34:03.399 --> 34:05.181
Well, we're not in the habit

34:05.281 --> 34:07.143
of asking spousal permission
before making an offer.

34:07.243 --> 34:09.625
Oh, cut the bullshit,
Erika, out of respect.

34:09.725 --> 34:13.069
It's not like you
don't have a pattern.

34:13.169 --> 34:14.870
That was a long time ago.

34:14.970 --> 34:17.633
Oh, so you're not
the same woman who slept

34:17.733 --> 34:20.997
with her best friend's
boyfriend?

34:21.097 --> 34:23.639
I know that narrative
makes good gossip.

34:23.739 --> 34:25.361
But we both know
you and Phil were on a break

34:25.461 --> 34:26.682
when he and I started dating.

34:26.782 --> 34:29.485
You were my line sister.
In what world is that OK?

34:29.585 --> 34:31.007
Phil didn't have
a problem with it.

34:31.107 --> 34:32.008
We worked through that.

34:32.108 --> 34:35.491
Exactly,
because it was college.

34:35.591 --> 34:37.693
Everyone was on-again,
off-again.

34:37.793 --> 34:41.857
But you two were on again
for the next two years.

34:41.957 --> 34:43.419
We were an important relationship

34:43.519 --> 34:45.141
for each other, yes.

34:45.241 --> 34:49.625
But ultimately, things didn't
work out, and you got the guy.

34:49.725 --> 34:51.827
You won.
- Oh, I know.

34:51.927 --> 34:53.669
I just need to make sure that
moving forward

34:53.769 --> 34:57.973
whatever Phil decides,
you don't have another agenda.

35:00.216 --> 35:05.601
My interest in Philip
is strictly professional.

35:05.701 --> 35:07.363
You have my word.

35:09.105 --> 35:13.009
You better hope
that means something this time.

Oh, fuck.

Oh, what the fuck?

36:21.016 --> 36:22.998
Hey, Connor?

36:23.098 --> 36:25.180
Oh, fuck.

36:28.023 --> 36:30.025
Guys?

36:33.309 --> 36:34.810
What the fuck?

36:34.910 --> 36:36.412
Where the fuck are you?

36:36.512 --> 36:38.934
Oh, fuck.

36:39.034 --> 36:41.577
Oh, fuck.

36:41.677 --> 36:43.679
Oh, fuck.

36:50.726 --> 36:52.708
What the fuck?

36:58.414 --> 37:03.319
Where the fuck is my car?

37:03.419 --> 37:08.444
What the fuck?

37:12.548 --> 37:14.550
What the fuck?

37:50.666 --> 37:52.528
What happened?

37:52.628 --> 37:54.290
Um...

37:54.390 --> 37:55.691
uh...

37:55.791 --> 37:58.334
uh...

37:58.434 --> 38:00.336
Connor and I
were hanging out after school.

38:00.436 --> 38:01.697
OK, and?

38:01.797 --> 38:04.400
And um...

38:06.802 --> 38:09.745
And...

38:09.845 --> 38:12.588
and he has a fake.

38:12.688 --> 38:14.670
And so we grabbed a few beers.

38:14.770 --> 38:16.552
Oh, my--drinking?

38:16.652 --> 38:17.833
Carlton, really.

38:17.933 --> 38:19.074
I only had like,
half a beer, Mom.

38:19.174 --> 38:21.757
I swear, I swear,
and I wasn't even buzzed.

38:21.857 --> 38:23.839
But I was driving home,

38:23.939 --> 38:26.802
and I started
feeling nauseous

38:26.902 --> 38:29.204
and disoriented.

38:29.304 --> 38:31.447
And so I pulled over
to the side of the road,

38:31.547 --> 38:35.010
and I--I started walking.

38:35.110 --> 38:36.492
Right, I was walking.

38:36.592 --> 38:40.376
And I just kept
walking and walking.

38:40.476 --> 38:45.261
And I looked up, and I didn't
even know where I was.

38:45.361 --> 38:49.004
I don't even remember
where I parked the car, Mom.

38:50.486 --> 38:52.268
I left my phone
and wallet in there.

38:52.368 --> 38:55.030
And look,
I've had drinks before.

38:55.130 --> 38:56.632
But this was different, Mom.

38:56.732 --> 38:58.854
I swear.
This was something else.

39:00.616 --> 39:02.858
What do you mean?

39:04.460 --> 39:06.462
It was the meds.

39:08.544 --> 39:10.946
It had to be the meds, Mom.
I know it.

39:17.272 --> 39:20.175
We're going
to figure this out.

39:20.275 --> 39:21.897
OK, baby?

39:40.816 --> 39:42.598
Thanks for staying.

39:42.698 --> 39:44.320
Well, of course.

39:44.420 --> 39:47.122
I actually wanted to,
because the hospital Jell-O

39:47.222 --> 39:49.445
is super fire,
if you didn't know.

39:54.109 --> 39:56.111
You're a good friend.

39:57.152 --> 39:58.934
- So we're friends again?
- I didn't say all that.

39:59.034 --> 40:01.116
You sure?

40:05.561 --> 40:10.826
You know, my whole life,
it was me and my mom.

40:10.926 --> 40:15.030
And then I come out here, and
it's auntie, uncle, cousins.

40:15.130 --> 40:16.211
You know, you're going
from a family of two

40:16.211 --> 40:18.654
to a family of six
just like that.

40:21.176 --> 40:25.040
But family's still family,
even if they don't look

40:25.140 --> 40:28.724
like the one you're used to.

40:28.824 --> 40:30.886
Thanks.

40:30.986 --> 40:33.068
Yeah.

40:34.389 --> 40:35.651
You know, it takes
a lot of energy

40:35.751 --> 40:38.734
to keep making
yourself the outsider.

40:38.834 --> 40:41.156
Trust me, I know.

40:48.884 --> 40:51.947
Well, he's here.

40:52.047 --> 40:56.211
6 pounds, 7 ounces,
big old head.

41:00.656 --> 41:02.918
I understand
if you're not ready yet.

41:06.622 --> 41:08.884
I want to meet
my little brother.

41:19.595 --> 41:21.417
Thanks, Will.

41:21.517 --> 41:23.819
Oh, I just gave her a ride.

41:23.919 --> 41:27.142
You did a lot more than that.

41:42.217 --> 41:44.880
Oh, Jackie. Jackie.

41:56.872 --> 41:58.173
<i>So he lost his car?</i>

41:58.273 --> 42:00.656
You really believe this?
None of this makes sense to me.

42:00.756 --> 42:03.459
I know.

42:03.559 --> 42:07.342
But at least he did
the right thing by calling me.

42:07.442 --> 42:10.025
That's exactly
what we asked him to do.

42:10.125 --> 42:12.227
And combining
his meds with alcohol?

42:12.327 --> 42:14.029
That's just reckless.
He knows better than that.

42:14.129 --> 42:16.031
Yes, and we need
to talk to him about it.

42:16.131 --> 42:18.674
<i>But he admitted to drinking
when he didn't have to.</i>

42:18.774 --> 42:21.356
If we attack him for it, he'll
never tell us the truth again.

42:21.456 --> 42:24.439
And Dr. Richardson confirmed
that tapering off his meds

42:24.539 --> 42:26.241
could lead to an episode
like he experienced?

42:26.341 --> 42:28.403
Yes, I called him
as soon as I got home.

42:28.503 --> 42:30.766
<i>Disorientation, nausea,
some of his patients</i>

42:30.866 --> 42:32.648
<i>even experience vertigo.</i>

42:32.748 --> 42:34.750
So you believe
his story holds up?

42:36.111 --> 42:37.893
<i>Right now I do.</i>

42:37.993 --> 42:41.216
Do you really want to go out
there and call him a liar?

42:51.046 --> 42:52.708
Oh.

42:52.808 --> 42:56.512
I'm calm. I'm calm.
No, no, no, no, it's fine.

42:56.612 --> 42:58.834
I know what I did was stupid.

42:58.934 --> 43:02.077
The drinking, trust me,
I've learned my lesson.

43:02.177 --> 43:03.198
I never want to do that again.

43:03.298 --> 43:04.720
Yeah, well, you're lucky
it wasn't worse.

43:04.820 --> 43:05.961
It's been a long night.

43:06.061 --> 43:07.202
Yeah, I just
want to lay down.

43:07.302 --> 43:08.363
Yes, I'm going
to go with him.

43:08.463 --> 43:09.685
Look, I'm fine, Mom.

43:09.785 --> 43:12.267
No, you're far
from fine, Carlton.

43:18.473 --> 43:20.215
We're gonna be keeping
a closer eye on you.

43:20.315 --> 43:22.317
We all will.

43:48.864 --> 43:52.287
Look, I know you've got
a lot on your mind right now,

43:52.387 --> 43:56.151
but I have a bit
of news about Doc.

44:11.246 --> 44:14.449
Hey, you seen Jackie?

44:15.250 --> 44:17.252
She went home.

44:27.703 --> 44:30.385
Ah, fuck.

44:35.590 --> 44:38.814
Yo, Brian, where the hell
have you been, man?

44:38.914 --> 44:41.336
Look, I'm just here
to get my shit.

44:41.436 --> 44:43.298
Get your shit?

44:43.398 --> 44:45.701
Hey, look, man,
what's going on?

44:45.801 --> 44:47.382
Look, you better
tell me something,

44:47.482 --> 44:49.344
because nobody else will.

44:54.409 --> 44:56.872
Look, Doc is not
who you think he is.

45:11.626 --> 45:14.449
- Geoffrey, what's up?
- I've got some good news.

45:14.549 --> 45:16.732
I found your vehicle,

45:16.832 --> 45:20.715
completely out of gas
and sand on the seats.

45:23.158 --> 45:26.301
Hmm, uh, wow.

45:26.401 --> 45:30.225
Hm, on the corner
of Reseda and Victory.

45:30.325 --> 45:34.029
Any of this sound familiar?

45:34.129 --> 45:39.314
Uh, like I said, I was lost.

45:39.414 --> 45:42.437
But thanks.

45:42.537 --> 45:45.580
You know what
I find interesting?

45:49.104 --> 45:51.086
What's that?

45:51.186 --> 45:54.249
It was about 10 miles
between where your mother

45:54.349 --> 45:56.091
picked you up
and where I found it.

45:56.191 --> 45:59.835
Quite a distance
for someone traveling on foot.

46:01.356 --> 46:05.140
Um...

46:05.240 --> 46:07.302
I don't know, Geoffrey.

46:07.402 --> 46:09.264
I...

46:09.364 --> 46:10.385
I already
told my parents

46:10.485 --> 46:13.588
that I don't recall most

46:13.688 --> 46:15.951
of what happened
yesterday, so...

46:16.051 --> 46:18.954
Yeah.

46:19.054 --> 46:21.456
I'm aware.

46:30.986 --> 46:34.449
Sooner or later,
your truth will have no choice

46:34.549 --> 46:36.972
but to reveal itself.

46:37.072 --> 46:40.015
You know that, don't you?

46:54.289 --> 46:56.832
Yeah?

46:56.932 --> 46:59.314
- Hey, Uncle Phil.
- Hey, nephew.

46:59.414 --> 47:04.819
Hey, do you have time
to talk about Zenith and Doc?

47:13.548 --> 47:17.492
Yeah, so apparently,

47:17.592 --> 47:19.935
Doc has been taking bribes

47:20.035 --> 47:23.959
to steer players
to colleges and agents.

47:25.600 --> 47:28.143
And now
someone is threatening

47:28.243 --> 47:31.947
to blow the whistle
on Doc and the entire team.

47:32.047 --> 47:34.049
Hmm?

47:36.171 --> 47:37.592
Yeah.

47:37.692 --> 47:39.694
Have a seat.
