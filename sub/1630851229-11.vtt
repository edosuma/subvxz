00:05.673 --> 00:06.672

00:06.823 --> 00:08.081

00:08.234 --> 00:10.992
"We, Jake and Gregg,
solemnly swear to treat

00:11.086 --> 00:12.660
Sammie as our natural child."

00:12.755 --> 00:14.329
Dr. Pravesh

00:14.348 --> 00:17.407
is gonna be spending more time
doing clinical trials,

00:17.409 --> 00:18.833
and we need somebody
to fill his slot

00:18.927 --> 00:20.702
-in the ER.
-Is that a job offer?

00:20.763 --> 00:22.412
I need a photo

00:22.414 --> 00:24.064
of my son.

00:24.841 --> 00:25.766
Mom!

00:25.860 --> 00:28.085
Perhaps when you feel up to it,

00:28.103 --> 00:30.437
you'll tell me
what's really going on.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.864
This could be something simple,
treatable.

00:32.015 --> 00:33.991
You know it's not.

00:35.685 --> 00:37.995
(whirring)

(inhales deeply)

01:04.623 --> 01:06.065
And?

01:07.217 --> 01:10.152
Would you like to talk
in your office?

01:12.055 --> 01:14.198
Let's just talk here.

01:19.062 --> 01:21.729
(Bell exhales)

01:21.749 --> 01:24.166
It's multiple sclerosis.

01:25.828 --> 01:27.311
Mixed white and gray matter

01:27.329 --> 01:30.330
with black holes consistent
with worsening damage.

01:30.482 --> 01:32.816
It's hard to know how long
it's been going on.

01:32.818 --> 01:36.077
Months, at least. Years, maybe.

01:37.156 --> 01:40.006
But the science is advancing
in this field,

01:40.159 --> 01:42.542
and there are
some amazing treatments.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.103
There's no cure.

01:44.330 --> 01:47.481
We will find ways
to help you get through this.

01:49.335 --> 01:50.350
A specialist

01:50.444 --> 01:54.613
-can tell you more.
-Okay. Thanks, Conrad.

01:54.840 --> 01:57.357
Not now.
Let's talk about it later.

01:57.526 --> 01:59.785
Thanks.

01:59.936 --> 02:02.037
Of course.

We love celebrating
Lunar New Year

04:28.327 --> 04:29.342
with Sammie,

04:29.511 --> 04:31.328
and when she heard
about what you were doing,

04:31.421 --> 04:33.755
she practically booked
the whole trip herself.

04:33.849 --> 04:36.016
(chuckles)
Where's Gregg?

04:36.168 --> 04:38.902
He had to work last-minute,
but he sends his love.

Well, let's get Sammie
settled first.

04:48.438 --> 04:50.455
How would you like to help
the preschoolers

04:50.682 --> 04:53.292
-make some decorations, honey?
How's that sound?
-Yes.

04:53.443 --> 04:56.277
BELL:
Yeah? Wonderful. All right,
come on. Let's do it.

04:56.355 --> 04:57.963
Bay Two, drop an NG tube

04:58.190 --> 05:00.023
for a gastric lavage
to identify if it's an upper

05:00.042 --> 05:01.449
or lower GI bleed.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.318
Bay Three, grab some sugar
packets from the breakroom.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.545
Sprinkle them on the
prolapsed stoma, then reduce it.

05:05.714 --> 05:07.030
-On it.
-Bay Four,

05:07.049 --> 05:08.140
avoid sutures
for that poor girl's head lac.

05:08.291 --> 05:10.559
Just use her hair
and some Dermabond.

05:13.221 --> 05:16.130
Dr. Sullivan,
I see why Kit hired you.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.708
-Bet you put the "go"
in "go, team."
-CADE: If I'm not ordering

05:18.802 --> 05:23.730
-new sneakers every other month,
I'm not doing my job.
-Me, too.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.216
So, how's your first week been?

05:26.385 --> 05:27.451
Fine.

05:30.222 --> 05:31.721
A bunch of us are gonna hit
the Lunar New Year party

05:31.740 --> 05:33.056
after work. You should join.

05:33.149 --> 05:36.242
-Free food.
-Yeah, tonight's not gonna work.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.487
Dr. Sullivan, I'm starting
to think you don't like us.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.174
I don't know you well enough
to like you or not, Dr. Feldman.

05:42.325 --> 05:45.827
Exactly. So maybe come hang
and, you know, find out.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.846
Unfortunately, I have plans.

05:47.997 --> 05:49.848
IRVING (whispering):
I don't think

05:49.999 --> 05:51.666
-she really has plans.
-(chuckles)

05:51.760 --> 05:53.352
So, what do we say to everyone

05:53.503 --> 05:56.838
who keeps asking us
who the new ER doctor is?

05:56.932 --> 05:59.265
Tell them I believe in the soul.

05:59.418 --> 06:02.435
The hanging curveball.
High fiber. Good Scotch.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.589
That the novels of Susan Sontag
are self-indulgent crap.

06:05.607 --> 06:07.607
I believe
Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

06:07.759 --> 06:09.092
And I believe there ought to be

06:09.185 --> 06:10.869
a constitutional amendment
outlawing Astroturf

06:11.020 --> 06:12.746
and the designated hitter.
I believe in opening

06:12.897 --> 06:14.539
-your presents...
-IRVING: ...in opening
your presents Christmas morning

06:14.766 --> 06:16.023
rather than Christmas Eve.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.192
Crash Davis's speech
from<i> Bull Durham.</i>

06:18.212 --> 06:20.120
-Great movie.
-CADE: It's the best.

06:20.196 --> 06:22.939
Evidence suggests you and I
could be friends, Feldman.

06:22.958 --> 06:24.958
I'm impossible not to like,
Sullivan.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.793
So, you aren't on social media.

06:26.870 --> 06:29.036
I tried to find you to make sure
you weren't a psychopath.

06:29.114 --> 06:31.781
Well, I'm not an exhibitionist

06:31.875 --> 06:34.226
-or a narcissist.
-Harsh.

06:34.377 --> 06:36.544
-But a picture is emerging.
-CADE: Love to get back

06:36.563 --> 06:38.788
-to my patients now.
If you don't mind.
-HUNDLEY: Mm.

06:38.807 --> 06:40.232
IRVING:
Do your thing.

06:40.383 --> 06:43.235
I so agree with everything
you just said, by the way.

06:43.386 --> 06:45.052
I, too, am tired
of the humblebrags

06:45.147 --> 06:46.888
and the... You're
just gonna keep wa... Okay.

06:46.982 --> 06:48.298

06:48.316 --> 06:50.817
Another successful interaction,
Zach.

06:50.969 --> 06:52.652
You paged?

06:52.804 --> 06:54.638
29-year-old female.

06:54.731 --> 06:56.731
Had a syncopal episode
during spinning class.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.065
She had a heart transplant,

06:58.085 --> 06:59.901
so figured
you should take a look.

06:59.995 --> 07:01.086
What do we have here?
Initial EKG,

07:01.237 --> 07:03.404
chest X-ray
and head CT negative.

07:03.424 --> 07:06.508
Vitals are stable.
She's awake and oriented.

07:09.671 --> 07:11.004
Call Hawkins.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.099
-IRVING: For a consult?
-Just call him.

07:17.829 --> 07:20.163
-What's up?
-AUSTIN: Hey.

07:20.332 --> 07:22.607
-Is it your mom?
-No. No, no,

07:22.759 --> 07:24.926
this is about a young lady
here in the ER

07:24.945 --> 07:27.428
with a syncopal episode
and a cardiac history.

07:27.506 --> 07:28.780
They called me to do a consult

07:29.007 --> 07:30.356
because she had
a heart transplant.

07:30.509 --> 07:32.451
-Okay. Let's have a look.
-It's...

07:32.602 --> 07:34.936
a little more complicated
than that.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.271
The transplant was performed
by a former colleague of mine

07:37.291 --> 07:40.417
at Redman Hospital
three years ago.

07:42.521 --> 07:43.687
Three years ago.

07:43.780 --> 07:46.706
-In September.
-When in September?

07:46.858 --> 07:49.259
September 17th.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.054
Yeah, there's no doubt about it.

07:54.032 --> 07:56.266
She has Nic's heart.

08:05.560 --> 08:08.153
Gigi, this is Sammie,
and she'd like to help you

08:08.304 --> 08:10.396
-with some decorations.
Is that okay?
-Okay.

08:10.549 --> 08:13.733
Hi, Sammie.
I'm not very good with scissors.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.885
I can help. I'll show you how.

08:15.979 --> 08:17.570
You're a great dad, Jake.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.164
She's a sweetheart.

08:19.391 --> 08:21.333
It's all Sammie.
I think she was born this way.

08:23.395 --> 08:25.504
So, what's this all about?

08:25.655 --> 08:27.005
Let's get a coffee,

08:27.156 --> 08:29.824

08:41.096 --> 08:43.021
Don't say anything to her.

08:43.248 --> 08:44.856

she has to know.

08:45.008 --> 08:47.192

about it. At least

you had a bad fall.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.041
Yeah. I started
taking a spin class.

09:03.268 --> 09:05.359
Been getting in good shape,
and I love it.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.270
So, you think maybe
you pushed yourself too hard?

09:07.363 --> 09:10.048
That's what's weird.
I mean, I don't think so.

09:10.199 --> 09:12.942
I forgot my spin shoes at home,
so I had to come back.

09:12.961 --> 09:14.869
And I remember I'd just joined

09:14.946 --> 09:16.721
the class
when "Nonstop" came on.

09:16.873 --> 09:18.873
-Ah, I love that song.
-(Hannah laughs)

09:18.892 --> 09:20.374
-(chuckles)
-Uh,

09:20.394 --> 09:22.786
and all of a sudden,
I couldn't catch my breath

09:22.804 --> 09:24.954
and just collapsed on the bike.

09:24.973 --> 09:28.233
Paramedics had to unclip me,
and I came to in here.

09:28.384 --> 09:31.027
Well, let's take a listen
to your heart, shall we?

09:34.983 --> 09:36.499
Your turn.

09:36.559 --> 09:38.451
Hmm?

09:44.067 --> 09:46.293
(heart beating)

09:58.824 --> 10:00.581
Heart sounds normal.

10:00.601 --> 10:03.660
AUSTIN:
All right, let's lie you down
for an echo.

10:03.753 --> 10:05.312
Okay.

10:07.682 --> 10:09.332
We saw that you had

10:09.351 --> 10:11.109
a heart transplant
a few years ago.

10:11.260 --> 10:14.170
Yeah. I'm one of the lucky ones.

10:14.189 --> 10:17.006
Well, aside from
the shortness of breath

10:17.025 --> 10:19.025
in class,
you have any leg swelling?

10:19.119 --> 10:20.785
Wake up with trouble breathing?

10:20.937 --> 10:22.269
HANNAH:
No, um,

10:22.289 --> 10:24.789
not since my transplant.

10:24.941 --> 10:26.866
It was like a miracle.

10:27.018 --> 10:29.035
I was born with a bad heart.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.036
I mean, I suffered

10:30.130 --> 10:32.780
with every symptom
of heart failure

10:32.799 --> 10:36.042
for so long, it felt
like I was dying every day.

10:36.194 --> 10:39.137
And then
after I got my new heart,

10:39.364 --> 10:40.287
I was alive again.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.700
Any other symptoms?
Anything at all?

10:43.718 --> 10:45.477
I have headaches occasionally.

10:48.039 --> 10:49.706
Well, the echo shows

10:49.724 --> 10:52.942
that your heart's
ejection fraction is low.

10:54.321 --> 10:58.047
Meaning it's-it's not pumping
as well as we'd like,

10:58.141 --> 11:00.566
which is probably the cause
of your collapse.

11:00.661 --> 11:03.310
Uh, Hannah,

11:03.330 --> 11:04.737
I'm sorry to tell you this,

11:04.831 --> 11:07.499
but you are
in early heart failure.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.984
(crying):
No. No, no.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.838
Um, I prayed that I'd never hear
those words again.

11:13.990 --> 11:16.733
This heart can't fail.

11:16.751 --> 11:18.418
It can't.

11:19.237 --> 11:20.586
After my transplant,
I did everything

11:20.739 --> 11:24.516
the doctors told me to do.
I-I never missed an appointment.

11:24.667 --> 11:25.850
I mean, I...

11:26.002 --> 11:27.519
-How could this happen?
-Don't worry.

11:27.670 --> 11:29.746
We're gonna run some labs,
and we're gonna figure this out.

11:29.839 --> 11:31.748
(Hannah breathing shakily)

11:31.766 --> 11:33.525
Relax.

11:33.752 --> 11:35.193
Take a deep breath.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.118
-Okay?
-Okay.

11:43.853 --> 11:44.944
There you go.

11:45.096 --> 11:46.705
It's gonna be okay.

11:46.932 --> 11:49.207
-What's the story there?
-IRVING: Hmm?

11:50.877 --> 11:53.002
Why do you ask?

11:53.696 --> 11:55.922
Why the urgent page?

11:56.717 --> 11:58.383
Now Hawkins seems concerned.

11:59.127 --> 12:02.804
So, are we sharing
personal tidbits now?

12:03.748 --> 12:05.223
Okay. All right. I deserve that.

12:05.450 --> 12:08.876
IRVING:
That young woman was
the recipient of a donor heart,

12:08.895 --> 12:10.620
and it belonged
to Conrad's wife,

12:10.638 --> 12:14.023
who died in an auto accident
three years ago.

12:14.793 --> 12:16.151
Damn.

12:17.629 --> 12:19.720
IRVING:
She was a legendary
nurse practitioner.

12:19.814 --> 12:21.222
One of us.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.983
And Nic and Conrad
were a great couple.

12:24.135 --> 12:26.803
A true love story.

12:26.821 --> 12:28.638
That's tragic.

12:28.656 --> 12:30.807
IRVING:
It's taken him years to recover.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.809
He's finally starting
to live again.

12:32.902 --> 12:34.477
And...

12:34.496 --> 12:35.995
if that woman
has something seriously wrong

12:36.089 --> 12:38.147
and should happen to die...

12:38.166 --> 12:41.259
-Who knows how he's gonna react.
-IRVING: Yeah.

12:42.003 --> 12:46.155
A few weeks ago,
I started feeling... off.

12:46.174 --> 12:50.159
Numbness in my hands
and a loss of dexterity.

12:50.178 --> 12:52.345
That's why I pulled myself

12:52.497 --> 12:54.180
out of surgery. I just wanted

12:54.332 --> 12:55.681
to make sure
I knew what it was first

12:55.776 --> 12:57.683
before-before I worried you.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.352
So I waited.

12:59.504 --> 13:01.613
But I got
the final results today.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.764
And I...
(exhales)

13:03.784 --> 13:05.675
I don't want to spoil
this visit.

13:05.693 --> 13:08.602
I've been so looking forward
to it. But you're here,

13:08.696 --> 13:10.013
-so...
-What is it?

13:10.015 --> 13:11.456
P-Please, just tell us.

13:11.683 --> 13:14.959
I have multiple sclerosis.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.871
Oh, darling, I'm so sorry.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.024
-We're-we're here for you.
-And I...

13:21.117 --> 13:22.859
I know. You know,
I just learned this morning,

13:22.877 --> 13:24.877
so I'm...

13:25.030 --> 13:27.430
still kind of processing.

13:28.533 --> 13:29.699
A-And to be honest,

13:29.759 --> 13:31.309
I'm just... I'm just reeling.

13:31.536 --> 13:33.186
Of course.

13:34.539 --> 13:36.055
But there's hope.

13:36.207 --> 13:38.149
-(chuckles)
-Whatever you've been
experiencing

13:38.301 --> 13:40.819
-can be treated with meds.
-JAKE: Yeah.

13:41.046 --> 13:42.244
W-We need to jump into this
right away.

13:42.246 --> 13:43.729
We need to find
the best place for you

13:43.882 --> 13:45.565
-to get treatment.
-I, you know, I have to round

13:45.659 --> 13:48.234
on some patients that I've been
asked to consult on, so...

13:48.386 --> 13:51.162
Of course. Go.
We'll get more information,

13:51.389 --> 13:53.573
and come find us
in my office when you're done.

13:53.725 --> 13:55.291
Yeah. Okay.

14:09.090 --> 14:11.741
Now the decompression.

14:12.501 --> 14:16.187
Placing the needle
into the subdural hematoma.

14:25.256 --> 14:26.364
Nicely done.

14:26.533 --> 14:30.017
I can see why AJ is courting you
for cardiothoracic.

14:30.095 --> 14:32.537
Choosing a specialty
is gonna be so hard.

14:32.764 --> 14:33.872
I wish I could do it all.

14:34.023 --> 14:35.948
I think
being a heart surgeon's great.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.101
If you want to be a plumber.

14:38.269 --> 14:39.544
(laughs)

14:39.771 --> 14:42.046
-Do not let Dr. Austin
hear you say that.
-(chuckles)

14:42.215 --> 14:45.216
No shade to Dr. Austin,
but the heart is just a pump.

14:45.326 --> 14:48.702
The brain is more complex
than the universe

14:48.796 --> 14:51.781
and the source of everything
that makes us human.

14:52.875 --> 14:56.619
It's the source of my dyslexia
and the key to overcoming it.

14:56.712 --> 14:58.287
See, it's personal to you.

14:58.381 --> 15:00.565
That's how passion
for a field is born.

15:00.792 --> 15:02.642
You think I could do this?

15:03.461 --> 15:06.070
We could always use more women
in neurosurgery.

15:06.297 --> 15:08.464
We are overloaded
with arrogant men.

15:09.225 --> 15:12.243
But I would never try
to recruit you.

15:12.470 --> 15:13.136
Why?

15:13.229 --> 15:15.138
Well, Devon would kill me,

15:15.156 --> 15:16.806
-for one thing.
-Oh. He...

15:16.899 --> 15:19.492
-He'll support
whatever I choose to do.
-I know.

15:19.644 --> 15:22.311
But as a neurosurgeon,
your life becomes the hospital.

15:22.330 --> 15:23.996
To be truly excellent
requires total commitment,

15:24.165 --> 15:26.315
and the pressure is intense.

15:26.334 --> 15:27.366
If you ever want

15:27.427 --> 15:30.744
-to have kids...
-That's far in the future.

15:30.838 --> 15:33.014
If ever.

15:34.008 --> 15:36.325
I really want to consider this.

15:36.344 --> 15:37.843
All right.

15:37.996 --> 15:40.104
Well, we can talk about it.

15:40.181 --> 15:42.273
You have both the brains
and the guts.

15:42.350 --> 15:44.333
(chuckles)

15:44.427 --> 15:46.760
Okay, you ready to try it blind?

15:46.780 --> 15:49.505
Oh, hell yeah.

15:50.266 --> 15:53.785
Lunar New Year was your father's
favorite holiday.

15:53.936 --> 15:55.178
And I also remember as a kid,

15:55.196 --> 15:56.603
he would give me
those little red envelopes.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.848
And I thought today,

15:58.866 --> 16:02.126
perhaps you could use one.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.708
Can always use a little luck.

16:08.860 --> 16:11.260
(Carol coughing)

16:14.032 --> 16:15.807
(sighs)

16:16.034 --> 16:17.200
(chuckles)

16:17.218 --> 16:19.811
Do you really think
this drug trial

16:19.962 --> 16:21.962
could beat my cancer?

16:22.649 --> 16:26.651
Most success rates are low,
generally, in clinical trials,

16:26.802 --> 16:27.986
but this one's different.

16:28.137 --> 16:29.729
I mean,
they're thinking this could be

16:29.881 --> 16:31.805
the next big thing
in lung cancer.

16:31.899 --> 16:33.157
But one step at a time, Mom.

16:33.309 --> 16:36.577
First, we have to get you
enrolled in the trial.

16:39.148 --> 16:42.667
So, my mother's cancer
is spreading.

16:42.894 --> 16:43.893
Her lung masses are growing,

16:43.911 --> 16:45.728
and there's a new met
in her liver,

16:45.730 --> 16:49.656
and if it continues to spread...

16:49.676 --> 16:52.260
The next step will be hospice.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.620
Yeah.

16:54.772 --> 16:56.072
We're not there yet,

16:56.090 --> 16:58.924
but I do want to give her
the best chance to live,

16:59.077 --> 17:01.410
and-and right now,
it's your trial.

17:01.429 --> 17:03.579
But have you looked
at the side effects

17:03.598 --> 17:04.856
-of this trial?
-Yeah.

17:05.083 --> 17:07.266
She can do this, Pravesh.

17:07.418 --> 17:09.752
I'll need to assess that
for myself

17:09.771 --> 17:12.104
-very carefully.
-Yeah.

17:12.257 --> 17:14.115
Yeah, please do.

17:15.426 --> 17:17.760
But...

17:17.779 --> 17:20.121
This is our last hope.

17:29.031 --> 17:30.773
-Hey. I heard.
-How?

17:30.866 --> 17:31.883
BILLIE:
The gossip mill at Chastain

17:32.052 --> 17:33.051
-is alive and well.
-(groans)

17:33.202 --> 17:35.219
We're all pulling for her.

17:35.446 --> 17:37.704
-Do you know what's wrong?
-Heart failure.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.782
We're seeing what we can do.

17:39.801 --> 17:41.467
How are you holding up?

17:42.228 --> 17:45.229
I'm keeping perspective.
The heart is a muscle.

17:48.793 --> 17:50.568
Hey.

17:50.795 --> 17:52.904
This is me, Conrad.

17:53.055 --> 17:55.782
Inside this woman
who walked into our ER

17:55.933 --> 17:58.818
is a part
of someone we both loved.

17:58.894 --> 18:01.037
That means something.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.323
After Nic died,
I kept seeing things

18:04.475 --> 18:06.342
that made me feel
like she was near me.

18:06.344 --> 18:09.495
A song we loved would
suddenly come on the radio.

18:09.647 --> 18:11.497
A woman in the park
with her laugh.

18:11.649 --> 18:14.241
I'd find an old note
she left for me in the drawer.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.551
That type of thing.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.079
Then eventually, it faded.

18:19.824 --> 18:22.007
But now a small part of her,

18:22.160 --> 18:24.844
a real part of her, is here.

18:24.996 --> 18:26.679
Alive.

18:26.831 --> 18:29.190
(alarm beeping)

18:30.944 --> 18:32.168
Hannah, talk to me.

18:32.261 --> 18:33.945
(gasping)
I can't... I can't breathe.

18:34.172 --> 18:36.188
-I can't breathe.
-She's hypotensive,

18:36.282 --> 18:38.007
tachycardic,
and her sats are dropping.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.009
CONRAD:
This looks
like cardiogenic shock.

18:40.027 --> 18:43.538
-I need a norepinephrine drip.
-And page Austin.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.870
Her ejection fraction
is only 15%.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.381
We need to get her
to the cath lab now.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.637
(monitor beeping steadily)

18:59.788 --> 19:01.139
AUSTIN:
Inserting

19:01.290 --> 19:02.974
the pump into the aorta.

19:03.125 --> 19:06.719
That should help her heart
pump a little easier.

19:06.871 --> 19:09.463
CONRAD:
But it's only a stopgap.
Her heart failure

19:09.557 --> 19:11.557
-is getting worse.
-BILLIE: She must be rejecting

19:11.709 --> 19:13.042
the transplanted heart.

19:13.135 --> 19:15.394
CONRAD:
I wish there were
some other explanation.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.322
AUSTIN:
Well, she stabilized enough
to tolerate

19:18.474 --> 19:20.900
the biopsy.
That should tell us more.

19:21.052 --> 19:23.369
Biopsy catheter to me.

19:31.004 --> 19:34.172
So, AJ told me
you've discussed how, um,

19:34.323 --> 19:37.675
brutal and, uh, dangerous
this trial would be.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.343
And you're sure
you'd want to do it?

19:39.495 --> 19:43.181
I'm sorry to ask you again,
but given the risks,

19:43.332 --> 19:45.683
I need to hear it
from you directly.

19:45.910 --> 19:48.060
Yes.

19:50.765 --> 19:52.356
And...

19:52.508 --> 19:55.918
do you have any concerns that
you want to discuss with me?

19:55.920 --> 19:58.938
I'm not just doing this
for myself

19:59.090 --> 20:00.756
but for others.

20:00.775 --> 20:02.349
I mean,

20:02.368 --> 20:05.261
it will help advance
the science, right?

20:05.279 --> 20:06.278
Yeah.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.597
That's the point
of the clinical trials.

20:08.616 --> 20:10.357
They're experiments.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.768
Okay. I'm in.

20:12.861 --> 20:14.712
I admire that enormously.

20:14.863 --> 20:17.940
But we still have to determine
if you meet the criteria,

20:17.959 --> 20:21.552
which means one more test.

20:21.779 --> 20:24.096
-Okay?
-Okay.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.616
So,

20:27.635 --> 20:30.978
I'm gonna put this
over your nose.

20:32.899 --> 20:36.125
Now I want you to put your mouth

20:36.143 --> 20:38.236
around this mouthpiece
and breathe in normally.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.988
(Carol inhales)

20:42.725 --> 20:44.391
All right, Carol. I want you

20:44.410 --> 20:47.411
-to pant. In and out.
-(Carol panting)

20:47.563 --> 20:48.579
Good.

20:50.641 --> 20:52.324
Now take a deep breath in.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.642
(Carol inhales)

20:53.736 --> 20:54.735
Now breathe all of the air out.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.329
-(Carol exhales)
-Keep going.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.340
Come on.

21:00.651 --> 21:03.410
(coughs)

21:03.429 --> 21:04.820
And we're done.

21:04.913 --> 21:07.265
Let me try that again.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.268
Okay. One more time.

21:12.163 --> 21:14.680
<i> The rules of the trial</i>
<i> are clear.</i>

21:14.832 --> 21:18.109
We need an FEV1 of 50% or more.

21:19.020 --> 21:22.113
Hers were 45 both times.

21:23.766 --> 21:25.674
I'm so sorry.

21:25.693 --> 21:27.326
She didn't pass.

21:29.363 --> 21:32.181
So, you're telling me that
she doesn't meet the criteria

21:32.199 --> 21:34.350
based on what's essentially
a rounding error?

21:34.352 --> 21:35.960
No, it's more
than a rounding error.

21:36.187 --> 21:37.353
There are other issues.

21:37.446 --> 21:38.779
I reviewed Carol's chart.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.615
Her echo and performance status
were borderline, AJ.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.968
A-Are you cherry-picking

21:44.119 --> 21:46.804
only healthy patients to protect

21:46.955 --> 21:48.121
your numbers?

21:48.141 --> 21:50.716
I'm not protecting my data.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.718
I'm protecting Carol.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.127
And given her condition,

21:54.221 --> 21:55.538
I'm not sure how likely it is

21:55.556 --> 21:56.814
this incredibly
difficult regimen

21:56.965 --> 21:58.357
would even help her.

21:59.468 --> 22:00.876
"Not sure"

22:00.895 --> 22:03.637
doesn't cut it when we're
talking about my mother's life.

22:03.731 --> 22:05.472
I'm sorry,

22:05.566 --> 22:07.842
but these criteria exist

22:07.844 --> 22:09.994
for a reason.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.222
Who are you?

22:14.016 --> 22:16.817
No, really,
is-is this who you are?

22:16.911 --> 22:18.727
A numbers dude

22:18.896 --> 22:22.965
who blocks
a desperate woman's last hope?

22:32.927 --> 22:35.019
(door closes)

22:42.937 --> 22:45.846
Wh-What happened?

22:45.865 --> 22:48.574
Your heart failure is worsening.

22:49.944 --> 22:51.685
We're waiting
for tests to confirm,

22:51.704 --> 22:53.854
but we're worried that...

22:54.022 --> 22:58.024
your body is rejecting
your transplanted heart.

22:58.861 --> 23:01.604
(voice breaking):
You have to fix it.

23:01.622 --> 23:03.547
Please.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.608
We're trying.

23:05.701 --> 23:09.445
I'll let you know as soon as we
get the results of the biopsy.

23:09.463 --> 23:10.963
Okay.

23:11.115 --> 23:12.948
If you need anything

23:12.967 --> 23:14.058
or you feel any discomfort,

23:14.285 --> 23:16.635
I want you to push
this red button, okay?

23:16.729 --> 23:19.522
I trust you.

23:20.549 --> 23:23.792
I know you'll help me.

23:23.794 --> 23:26.028
I will.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.134
CADE:
Hey.

23:32.153 --> 23:33.318
I'm doing a split shift,

23:33.471 --> 23:35.471
so I'll be taking care
of Hannah in the ICU.

23:35.564 --> 23:38.732
-Want me to catch you up?
-No. Already did that myself.

23:38.859 --> 23:40.233
I'll keep a close eye.

23:40.311 --> 23:43.129
Page you if anything comes up.

23:44.665 --> 23:46.573
Conrad?

23:46.667 --> 23:48.050
Yeah?

23:49.670 --> 23:52.555
I'm sorry about your wife.

23:54.175 --> 23:55.916
Thanks,
but this isn't about Nic.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.676
It's about Hannah, okay?

23:57.828 --> 24:01.063
(indistinct P.A. announcements)

24:10.766 --> 24:15.077
(muffled):
Open. Ah. Open...

24:15.846 --> 24:17.029
It's good. It's okay.

24:17.181 --> 24:19.331
-(man grunts)
-It's okay.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.369
(exhales)

24:24.464 --> 24:26.755
<i> -(high-pitched ringing)</i>
-Oh!

24:32.029 --> 24:35.121
(echoes):
Dr. Bell, are you okay?

24:35.883 --> 24:38.309
(echoes):
Yeah, fine. Thanks.

24:39.312 --> 24:40.978
(exhales)

24:41.129 --> 24:43.355
<i> (high-pitched ringing)</i>

24:49.489 --> 24:50.729
<i> (ringing fades)</i>

24:50.823 --> 24:53.199
(panting echoing)

25:06.172 --> 25:07.838
-(knocks)
-We have great news.

25:07.990 --> 25:09.006
Kit and I have been calling in

25:09.233 --> 25:10.174
every favor.
We're really excited

25:10.401 --> 25:12.401
to tell you
what we've come up with.

25:12.494 --> 25:13.919
Sit down.

25:15.239 --> 25:18.073
It's all right. I'm not
completely incapacitated yet.

25:18.166 --> 25:20.351
Uh, n-no, I know. I just...

25:20.520 --> 25:24.246
The landscape around MS
is always evolving.

25:24.265 --> 25:27.841
New immunomodulator therapies
reduce relapses

25:27.935 --> 25:29.418
and progression.

25:29.436 --> 25:30.602
JAKE:
If you experience a relapse

25:30.696 --> 25:31.862
after, uh, starting

25:32.089 --> 25:33.605
one treatment,
many patients try another,

25:33.758 --> 25:36.275
and-and they keep trying
until they're symptom-free.

25:36.351 --> 25:38.761
Finding the right specialist
is paramount,

25:38.779 --> 25:40.520
so Jake pulled some strings

25:40.614 --> 25:44.283
and got you a neuro consult
at the Mayo Clinic on Tuesday.

25:44.435 --> 25:46.377
JAKE: The chair of
the department's a friend.

25:46.528 --> 25:48.937
I did his nephew's cleft palate
surgery a few years ago.

25:49.031 --> 25:50.606
He's already been filled in.

25:50.699 --> 25:52.883
Thank you. Both of you.

25:53.035 --> 25:54.200
JAKE:
So you'll go?

25:54.220 --> 25:56.111
-Yeah, of course.
-(Jake chuckles)

25:56.130 --> 25:58.038
-And I'm-I'm grateful.
-(Kit sighs)

25:58.206 --> 25:59.615
I'm so encouraged.

25:59.633 --> 26:02.542
-Jake, I need
a couple minutes alone with Kit.
-Yeah.

26:02.562 --> 26:06.021
I'll, uh, let Mayo know
you're confirmed.

26:08.383 --> 26:11.193
-(Bell exhales)
-(door opens)

26:11.737 --> 26:13.362
(door closes)

26:14.574 --> 26:16.632
Kit, I'm leaving Chastain.

26:16.650 --> 26:18.150
A leave of absence.

26:18.302 --> 26:20.727
-Of course. To heal...
-No. Permanently.

26:20.896 --> 26:22.137
What?

26:22.230 --> 26:24.081
I'll-I'll try the treatments,

26:24.232 --> 26:26.733
and I'm grateful for the help,

26:26.902 --> 26:27.993
but I'll never operate again,

26:28.145 --> 26:30.421
-even if I get markedly better.
-Why not?

26:30.572 --> 26:33.740
You at 95% is better
than anyone at 100.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.834
It's more complicated than that.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.411
Then, please, explain it to me.

26:38.431 --> 26:42.466
-Optic neuritis. You familiar?
-Of course.

26:42.693 --> 26:43.750
Eye pain, vision loss.

26:43.844 --> 26:45.327
Are you experiencing any?

26:45.420 --> 26:48.254
I just had an episode.
It cleared up.

26:48.274 --> 26:51.275
But it's a sign the disease
is progressing rapidly.

26:51.426 --> 26:54.445
I'll lose my strength,
then the ability to walk

26:54.596 --> 26:57.114
and speak and eat.

26:57.191 --> 26:58.616
And at some point,

26:58.767 --> 27:01.176
-I'll end up paralyzed
in a hospital bed...
-Okay, stop.

27:01.195 --> 27:03.287
-...unable to feed myself.
-Stop.

27:03.514 --> 27:05.164
Stop.

27:07.609 --> 27:09.534
(inhales sharply)

27:09.703 --> 27:11.945
(stammers)

27:11.964 --> 27:16.050
See, you fell in love with
the man that I wanted to be.

27:19.029 --> 27:22.765
And I became him because of you.

27:24.702 --> 27:27.811
What are you saying?

27:27.963 --> 27:30.272
I love you.

27:32.393 --> 27:35.468
And I will not saddle you
with this.

27:35.562 --> 27:37.713
(pager beeping)

27:37.731 --> 27:41.216
I have a welcome speech to give,
but don't leave.

27:41.235 --> 27:44.453
-We have to talk about this.
-No, we don't.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.290
I have an office to pack.

27:54.748 --> 27:57.091
♪ ♪

28:10.672 --> 28:12.564
♪ ♪

28:39.460 --> 28:40.509
Kit!

28:42.722 --> 28:45.222
Hey, Kit!

28:47.375 --> 28:48.475
Kit!

28:49.878 --> 28:51.437
What'd he say?

28:54.883 --> 28:57.192
What happened?

29:12.901 --> 29:14.659
(screams)

29:14.812 --> 29:16.812
Gigi, wait! Sammie, wait!

29:16.830 --> 29:19.298
-Sammie!
-(screams)

29:20.834 --> 29:24.094
(monitor beeping rapidly)

29:24.321 --> 29:27.339
She's seizing.
Two milligrams of lorazepam now.

29:27.433 --> 29:30.017
I'm gonna get her on her side
before she aspirates.

29:36.591 --> 29:39.334
-(door opens)
-So, she came in
with heart failure,

29:39.353 --> 29:40.760
rapidly developed
cardiogenic shock.

29:40.780 --> 29:43.188
-BILLIE: And now seizures?
-CADE: Despite everything

29:43.265 --> 29:44.339
we're throwing at her,
she continues trending

29:44.432 --> 29:46.266
-in the wrong direction.
-She has a bleed.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.193
BILLIE:
Likely caused by the blood
thinners we put her on

29:48.345 --> 29:49.602
for the balloon pump.

29:49.696 --> 29:51.938
I mean, thankfully, it's small,
so we can just monitor.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.940
But look at the meninges
lining her brain.

29:53.959 --> 29:56.018
Usually they're smooth,
but here they're bumpy.

29:56.111 --> 29:58.036
Something more serious
is happening here.

29:58.188 --> 29:59.463
Infection.

29:59.690 --> 30:01.114
An infection while
we're blasting her with meds

30:01.133 --> 30:02.858
to suppress her immune system
would be deadly.

30:03.027 --> 30:05.710
-Devi and I will do
a spinal tap.
-I'll get her a full body scan.

30:05.863 --> 30:08.121
I'll send off autoimmune labs
and talk to pathology,

30:08.140 --> 30:09.431
see if the biopsy results
are back.

30:10.868 --> 30:13.459
-So what did I miss?
-Hannah's labs came back normal.

30:13.479 --> 30:16.980
Spinal tap was negative.
No cancer on the full body scan.

30:17.207 --> 30:18.056
Pathology told me
her biopsy proves

30:18.208 --> 30:19.224
she's rejecting her heart.

30:19.376 --> 30:21.059
Tacro levels
are in the basement.

30:21.211 --> 30:22.727
So her heart's failing because
she's probably not taking

30:22.880 --> 30:24.896
-her immunosuppressants.
-I don't think she would
do that.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.139
Not based on everything
she told us.

30:26.233 --> 30:27.899
Well, we don't
really know her, do we?

30:28.052 --> 30:30.327
You know,
people can surprise you.

30:30.478 --> 30:32.120
(pager beeps)

30:32.981 --> 30:34.832
I got to check on a patient.

30:34.908 --> 30:36.750
I'll be back in five.

30:39.821 --> 30:41.004
You all right?

30:41.156 --> 30:44.749
My mom's not getting
into Devon's trial.

30:44.844 --> 30:47.344
He said she missed the cut.

30:47.495 --> 30:49.179
Why don't you talk to Hannah
about those meds?

30:49.331 --> 30:50.722
I'll talk to Devon.

30:59.099 --> 31:01.507
(distant fireworks booming)

31:01.527 --> 31:05.362
Carol was outside the FEV1
entry criteria by five percent?

31:07.424 --> 31:09.700
Those are the rules.
My hands are tied.

31:09.851 --> 31:11.184
Protocol exists for a reason.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.370
I taught you to break
the rules for the patients.

31:13.597 --> 31:14.872
You taught me to also follow
the science.

31:15.023 --> 31:17.799
And what you're saying now
is to ignore it.

31:17.859 --> 31:18.876
Yeah, we both know her odds

31:19.027 --> 31:20.452
are long
and this is your first trial,

31:20.604 --> 31:24.606
but to turn her down because
she'd skew your statistics?

31:24.741 --> 31:25.957
Do you think it was easy for me

31:26.126 --> 31:28.385
to tell AJ that she wasn't
a candidate?

31:29.296 --> 31:30.870
But I know it was
the right thing to do.

31:30.964 --> 31:32.297
The right thing to do for who?

31:32.449 --> 31:34.799
The patient, the pharma company
or for you?

31:34.894 --> 31:38.353
(sighs)
For everyone.

31:39.398 --> 31:42.382
If your father were still alive,

31:42.476 --> 31:47.053
and you had a chance to save
him with this trial,

31:47.131 --> 31:49.889
but he didn't fit the criteria
by a small number,

31:49.967 --> 31:52.075
would you make the same call
you did for Carol?

31:52.302 --> 31:55.137
I have spent all day
trying to convince myself

31:55.230 --> 31:57.397
it is okay to let her
into this trial.

31:57.458 --> 31:59.991
But I know that if I do,
she will likely end up

32:00.085 --> 32:02.978
on dialysis
when her kidneys fail.

32:02.996 --> 32:06.998
Fluid in her lungs will make her
feel like she is drowning.

32:07.167 --> 32:10.018
But what if she
makes it through?

32:10.154 --> 32:12.912
I don't see that happening.

32:13.006 --> 32:15.081
Carol is brave.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.250
She wants to help the science.

32:17.344 --> 32:19.770
But if I bend the rules
to let her in,

32:19.921 --> 32:23.357
her sacrifice,
it won't even do that.

32:25.335 --> 32:26.592
I am not going to torture

32:26.612 --> 32:28.503
an older immunocompromised
woman.

32:28.596 --> 32:32.741
She's already been through
enough. I won't do it.

32:37.864 --> 32:39.998
(indistinct P.A. announcements)

32:43.353 --> 32:44.869
-You talk to Devon?
-I did.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.446
-And?
-I'll explain later.

32:46.465 --> 32:49.191
But we will do what's right
for Carol, I promise.

32:49.284 --> 32:50.950
We're out of time.
She's getting worse.

32:51.119 --> 32:52.877
What about
the immunosuppressants?

32:53.030 --> 32:55.288
She insists she's been taking
them. She has from the start.

32:55.382 --> 32:58.624
She told us she had headaches
off and on.

32:58.719 --> 33:00.869
She had seizures.

33:00.887 --> 33:02.795
Maybe she thinks
she's taking the meds.

33:02.889 --> 33:05.649
She could be forgetting
to take them,

33:05.800 --> 33:09.194
because of an underlying
neurological problem.

33:13.066 --> 33:15.550
How long has she been
tapping like that?

33:15.719 --> 33:16.827
CADE:
For hours.

33:17.054 --> 33:19.121
It's the same consistent tempo.

33:24.745 --> 33:28.547
Her tapping matches the beat
of her heart on the monitor.

33:30.234 --> 33:32.968
Maybe she's hearing
her heartbeat in her ears.

33:37.683 --> 33:40.166
You're right. I can hear it.

33:40.185 --> 33:42.185
Must be a dural
arteriovenous fistula.

33:42.337 --> 33:43.836
AUSTIN:
An abnormal connection

33:43.972 --> 33:45.856
of blood vessels in the brain.

33:46.083 --> 33:48.174
Explaining all her symptoms.

33:48.193 --> 33:49.918
From the headaches
to the seizures

33:49.936 --> 33:54.256
to forgetting to take her meds,
resulting in the heart failure.

33:54.274 --> 33:57.592
So, her heart problem
is really a brain problem.

33:57.685 --> 33:59.995
And that can be fixed
through surgery.

34:02.023 --> 34:04.082
One second.

34:08.939 --> 34:10.438
Unequal pupils.

34:10.532 --> 34:11.864
Her brain bleed
is getting worse.

34:11.884 --> 34:14.968
I'll page Billie now.

34:16.055 --> 34:18.055
LEELA:
Dr. Austin?

34:18.206 --> 34:20.039
If you don't mind,
I'd like to monitor

34:20.133 --> 34:23.968
our patient's intraoperative
cardiac function.

Of course.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.233
This one's for Nic.

34:40.487 --> 34:41.970
-Sammie?
-Gigi?

34:41.988 --> 34:43.413
-Sammie, Gigi!
-Gigi?

34:43.565 --> 34:45.916
-Sammie!
-Gigi?

Sammie!

34:51.665 --> 34:53.465
-Girls?
-Sammie!

34:55.001 --> 34:57.577
Once there was a little bunny

34:57.596 --> 34:59.003
who wanted to run away.

34:59.098 --> 35:02.657
So he said to his mother,
"I'm running away."

35:02.676 --> 35:04.492
"If you run away,"
said his mother,

35:04.586 --> 35:08.346
"I'll run after you,
for you are my little bunny."

35:08.440 --> 35:11.182
"If you run after me,"
said the little bunny,

35:11.335 --> 35:13.852
"I'll become a fish
in a trout stream,

35:14.004 --> 35:16.004
and I will swim away from you."

35:16.022 --> 35:18.340
So the mommy keeps him safe?

35:18.433 --> 35:21.785
Yes, you see? No matter
what the little bunny does,

35:21.936 --> 35:23.345
he's always protected.

35:23.438 --> 35:27.440
Like you protected me
from the dragon?

35:27.459 --> 35:29.126
SAMMIE:
That's right, Gigi.

35:41.715 --> 35:43.515
(monitor beeping rapidly)

35:44.643 --> 35:46.476
BILLIE:
It was unavoidable.

35:46.628 --> 35:49.813
Two large bore suctions.

35:50.040 --> 35:52.707
Sutures. We have
to repair the sinus.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.152
AUSTIN:
Cardiac doppler to me.

35:57.047 --> 35:59.397
We got an air embolism.

35:59.549 --> 36:01.641
LEELA:
If air in the blood
hits the heart,

36:01.660 --> 36:03.994
it could be fatal.

BILLIE:
Chu, drop the head of the bed.

I would have died to save her,

No one could.

38:35.205 --> 38:37.314
I know better than anyone
there is nothing harder

38:37.465 --> 38:40.132
than not being able
to deliver a miracle.

38:40.301 --> 38:42.652
This trial
would not help your mom.

38:42.729 --> 38:44.154
It would harm her.

38:45.324 --> 38:46.656
But that doesn't mean
there's nothing we can do

DEVON:
Carol, I'm gonna call
your oncologist

39:30.293 --> 39:32.927
about starting you
on palliative care right away.

39:33.096 --> 39:35.446
It's not hospice.

39:35.599 --> 39:36.873
You don't need that yet.

39:37.024 --> 39:40.359
No, no. Palliative care doctors
will treat your symptoms

your best life without pain.

we should've started

39:46.200 --> 39:47.625

Studies have shown that people
with metastatic lung cancer

who continue

39:54.968 --> 39:57.802
aggressive

The fistula in your brain

40:15.897 --> 40:16.971
didn't just cause headaches.

40:16.990 --> 40:18.489
It affected your memory.

40:18.642 --> 40:20.825
That made you forget
to take the meds,

40:20.977 --> 40:22.310
which led to the rejection.
