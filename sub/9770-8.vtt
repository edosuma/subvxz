10:50.649 --> 10:52.610
Zoey said it was a good idea
for you to date Lola?

10:52.693 --> 10:55.363
- Yep. Lola asked her, you
know, to make sure it was ok,

10:55.446 --> 10:57.782
and Zoey said it was
a great idea.

10:57.865 --> 11:00.159
- Look, man, sit down.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.496
Now listen...

11:03.579 --> 11:04.955
- You're not gonna ask me out,
are you?

11:05.039 --> 11:06.207
- No, your hair's too bushy
for me.

11:07.666 --> 11:10.503
Look, if Zoey told Lola it was
cool to ask you out,

11:10.586 --> 11:14.882
then that means Zoey thinks of
you as just a friend.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.258
But don't go get all
depressed, man.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.593
Lola's smokin'.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.512
You should be psyched
she's into you.

11:19.595 --> 11:22.765
- Yeah.
- You should.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.600
- I know.
- I'm serious.

11:24.683 --> 11:24.725
- Ok.

11:35.277 --> 11:35.736
NICOLE: Next question.

11:38.114 --> 11:41.742
Um--Zoe!

11:41.826 --> 11:43.035
[snaps fingers]

11:43.119 --> 11:44.537
- Why would Lola wanna ask
Chase out?

11:44.620 --> 11:47.164
- Ok. I thought you said you
didn't want to talk about it.

11:47.248 --> 11:50.292
- I don't. Ok.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.420
What was the name of
President McKinley's wife,

11:52.503 --> 11:53.254
the first lady?

11:53.337 --> 11:54.839
- I think her name was...Ida?

11:54.922 --> 11:58.134
- Can you even picture them
going out together?

11:58.217 --> 11:59.885
- President McKinley and Ida?

11:59.969 --> 12:01.262
- No, Chase and Lola.

12:01.345 --> 12:03.055
- So you do want to talk
about it.

12:03.139 --> 12:03.806
- No. Stop bringing it up.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.935
- Listen, Chase and Lola

12:08.018 --> 12:09.770
probably aren't even
gonna go out.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.356
- Why do you think that?
- 'Cause Lola asked him,

12:12.440 --> 12:14.150
and Chase said he had to
think about it.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.569
- What? Wait.
How do you know this?

12:16.652 --> 12:18.821
- Lola told me.
- Well, why didn't you tell me?

12:18.904 --> 12:21.449
All you ever do is talk about
stuff, and today you decide

12:21.532 --> 12:22.741
it's a good idea to keep
your big yap shut?

12:22.825 --> 12:26.245
- All right.
What is your deal?

12:27.246 --> 12:29.498
- I don't know.
I'm just...

12:29.582 --> 12:31.000
worried.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.335
- Why?
- 'Cause...

12:33.419 --> 12:34.420
Chase is like
my closest guy friend

12:34.503 --> 12:37.298
and Lola's my roommate,

12:37.381 --> 12:39.467
and I just don't want
anyone to get hurt.

12:40.968 --> 12:42.219
- Are you sure that's
what's bugging you, Zoe?

12:42.303 --> 12:43.262
- Yeah.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.389
[door opens]

12:47.975 --> 12:49.685
- Guess what?
Chase said yes!

12:49.768 --> 12:51.187
How great is that?

12:55.524 --> 12:57.526
- So...great.

13:15.544 --> 13:16.921
- Hey. What's up?

13:20.007 --> 13:22.468
Oh, my god.
- Uh-huh.

13:22.551 --> 13:24.845
- We were supposed to play
tennis after school.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.890
- At 4:30.
- All right. I am the worst.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.225
- How could you forget?

13:29.308 --> 13:31.393
- Well, Lola has her biology
test tomorrow,

13:31.477 --> 13:34.021
and I was making her a list of
stuff she needs to know.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.523
Look. It's color-coded.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.650
- It's adorable.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.361
- You're mad.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.779
- Noooo.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.656
- Look, I promise
I won't do it again.

13:44.573 --> 13:45.908
- Ok.

13:45.991 --> 13:46.742
Hey, you wanna go to sushi racks

13:46.825 --> 13:48.494
and get a spicy
California roll?

13:48.577 --> 13:50.663
- I do.
- Good.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.748
- But...I can't.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.208
- How come?

13:54.291 --> 13:57.920
- I'm, uh, seeing a movie
on campus with Lola.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.880
- Ok, busy boy, you let me know

13:59.964 --> 14:01.048
when you have some time
on your schedule.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.646
[playing trombone]

14:15.729 --> 14:17.648
- Ok, there's Quinn.
You ready to practice?

14:17.731 --> 14:20.276
- Why do I have to do this?

14:20.359 --> 14:21.902
- Because.
You got the look down,

14:21.986 --> 14:23.112
but if you want to get
girls,

14:23.195 --> 14:24.780
you gotta get
the attitude down.

14:24.863 --> 14:27.575
- Why do I have to act like
a jerk to make girls want me?

14:27.658 --> 14:28.826
- I don't know why.
I just know it works.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.495
Now go be a jerk to
Quinn.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.164
- [sighs] Ok.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.382
- Oh. Hi, Dustin.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.634
What did you do
to your hair?

14:45.718 --> 14:47.303
- None of your business.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.847
- Ok. Um...hey!

14:49.930 --> 14:52.933
Check out this new riff I wrote
for a song I'm working on.

14:54.351 --> 14:57.605
[plays trombone]

15:05.571 --> 15:06.780
Well?

15:06.864 --> 15:09.116
- It's a'ight.

15:09.199 --> 15:10.993
- It's a'ight?

15:11.076 --> 15:12.119
- Yeah. I've heard better.

15:12.202 --> 15:14.204
I've heard worse.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.790
- I worked for 3 weeks
on that riff.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.375
- Pfft. Whatever.

15:19.918 --> 15:20.919
- Well!

15:34.266 --> 15:36.518
- So, how'd I do?
- Perfect.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.354
Now you got the look
and the obnoxious attitude,

15:38.437 --> 15:43.317
which means you are ready to go
on a double-date with me.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.527
- Don't we need girls?
- Already hooked up.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.821
We're taking out
the Baldwin sisters.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.448
- Are they nice?
- Who cares?

15:49.531 --> 15:52.201
One's my age, one's your
age...and they're hot.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.578
- All right!
- All right!

16:01.919 --> 16:03.212
Come on.

16:16.517 --> 16:20.020
[TV playing]

16:20.104 --> 16:21.689
[turns TV volume down]

16:26.527 --> 16:27.736
- Here you go.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.112
- Thanks.

16:39.581 --> 16:43.585
- Um, you girls have a much
nicer lounge than we do.

16:43.669 --> 16:44.670
- Thanks.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.674
- Um...

16:49.425 --> 16:50.801
so where's everybody?

16:52.010 --> 16:53.470
- I guess at dinner.

16:54.888 --> 16:57.057
- Oh. Yeah.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.600
Ahem.

16:59.643 --> 17:00.686
So...

17:02.563 --> 17:04.314
Hey!

17:05.733 --> 17:07.233
You wanna play
"Would you Rather?"

17:07.317 --> 17:08.694
- I don't know.
How do you play?

17:08.777 --> 17:10.279
- Well, I give you
two insane choices,

17:10.362 --> 17:12.156
and you have to pick
which one you'd rather do.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.781
- Ok. Go.

17:13.866 --> 17:17.453
- Ok, um, would you rather...

17:17.536 --> 17:20.622
be locked in a cage
with a wild tiger or...

17:20.705 --> 17:22.583
lick peanut butter
off a hobo's foot?

17:23.834 --> 17:24.960
- What?

17:25.042 --> 17:26.627
- Which would you rather do?

17:26.712 --> 17:28.005
- Why would I ever have to
choose between

17:28.088 --> 17:29.548
being locked
in a cage with a tiger

17:29.631 --> 17:32.968
or licking peanut butter
off a hobo's foot?

17:33.051 --> 17:35.345
- Well, you wouldn't. See,
that's the fun of it.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.641
You know what? Never mind.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.227
You're right.
It's a dumb game.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.689
- Ok. You wanna
watch some more TV?

17:45.773 --> 17:48.734
- Um...yeah, I guess.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.993
[turns TV volume up]

17:58.076 --> 18:01.246
<i>[man singing pop song</i>
<i>on TV]</i>

18:06.251 --> 18:07.961
[turns TV off]

18:08.045 --> 18:09.880
- You're not into this.

18:09.963 --> 18:12.674
- Uh, what--what do you mean?

18:12.758 --> 18:14.551
- You and me going out.

18:15.677 --> 18:17.096
You're not into it,
are you?

18:18.222 --> 18:21.058
- Well, look, I wouldn't say--

18:21.141 --> 18:22.309
- Who is she?

18:22.392 --> 18:24.228
- W-who's who?

18:24.311 --> 18:25.854
- The girl you like.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.400
- Why do you think
I like another girl?

18:30.484 --> 18:31.068
- Because I'm smart.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.319
Does she go to PCA?

18:33.654 --> 18:36.698
- Um...

18:36.782 --> 18:38.534
no.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.035
She, uh...

18:40.118 --> 18:41.870
she's from my hometown.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.332
You know, back home...

18:45.415 --> 18:46.750
in my town.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.711
- Ok.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.507
Listen, I'm gonna head up
to my room.

18:53.590 --> 18:55.008

18:55.092 --> 18:56.218
- It's cool.

19:01.139 --> 19:03.725
So, which would you rather do?

19:03.809 --> 19:04.893
- Huh?

19:04.977 --> 19:06.687
LOLA: Be locked in a cage
with a wild tiger

19:06.770 --> 19:08.522
or lick peanut butter
off a hobo's foot?

19:08.605 --> 19:11.859
- Oh. Easy. Peanut butter
off a hobo's foot.

19:11.942 --> 19:13.026
- Why?

19:13.110 --> 19:14.278
- I'm scared of tigers

19:14.361 --> 19:15.779
and I love peanut butter.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.323
- [laughs]
Later.

19:19.867 --> 19:20.951
- Later.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.965
- Ok. There they are.

19:35.048 --> 19:36.633
- Whoa! Those are our dates?

19:36.717 --> 19:39.428
- Yeah. Now remember,
if you want her to like you,

19:39.511 --> 19:41.138
be like me.
- Be like you.

19:41.221 --> 19:43.432
- Just like we practiced.
- Right.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.683
- Ok.

19:48.186 --> 19:49.980
LOGAN: Well, well, well.

19:50.063 --> 19:51.607
Either you're our dates
or you're just lucky enough

19:51.690 --> 19:53.358
to be in the right place
at the right time.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.319
- Hi, Logan.
- This is Stacy.

19:55.402 --> 19:56.862
She's in my Spanish class.

19:56.945 --> 19:59.907
- I'm Tracy, and I'm in your
history class.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.283
- Right. Whatever.

20:01.366 --> 20:02.784
- I'm Dustin.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.119
- Hi. I'm Sandy.

20:04.202 --> 20:05.621
- That's a really cool shirt.

20:05.704 --> 20:06.663
- Thanks.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.624
- [sighs]

20:08.707 --> 20:09.958
Excuse us.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.837
What up with the compliment?
- What?

20:13.921 --> 20:15.756
- I told you girls don't like
guys who are nice.

20:15.839 --> 20:18.967
- But I don't know if I'm as
good at being a jerk as you are.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.594
- Well, try harder!

20:22.804 --> 20:24.765
Ok. You guys wanna see a movie
or what?

20:24.848 --> 20:26.725
- Uh...sure.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.810
- What do want to see, Sandy?
- Well...

20:28.894 --> 20:30.896
- I'm dying to see
<i>Restless in Love.</i>

20:30.979 --> 20:32.356
- Me, too.
- Cool.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.816
- Whoa, whoa. We're not seeing
a chick flick.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.360
- It a romantic comedy.

20:36.443 --> 20:39.029
And I find the term
"chick flick" insulting.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.615
- Whatever. But if you expect
us to buy the tickets,

20:41.698 --> 20:42.950
we're picking the movie.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.869
- Ok. I knew you were kind of
obnoxious,

20:45.953 --> 20:48.080
but this is a little
out of control.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.623
- Uh, excuse us.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.584
- What?
- I don't know

20:52.668 --> 20:54.753
if the "being a jerk" thing
is working too well.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.421
- Look, do I get
a lot of girls?

20:56.505 --> 20:58.507
- You talk about getting
a lot of girls.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.634
- Just let me handle this, ok?

21:02.344 --> 21:03.762
Ok, I'll tell you what.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.597
We'll take you to see
<i>Restless in Love,</i>

21:05.681 --> 21:07.265
but you guys are paying.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.184
- Actually, you know what
I'd rather see?

21:09.267 --> 21:10.185
- What?
-<i> The Jerk in the Fountain.</i>

21:10.269 --> 21:12.396

<i>in the Fountain?</i>

Hey!

21:17.985 --> 21:18.902
Ok! That was ridiculous!

21:18.986 --> 21:20.779
- So are you.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.616
Sandy, you want me to walk you
back to your dorm?

21:26.618 --> 21:28.495
- Nah. I'm gonna hang
with Dustin.

21:28.578 --> 21:30.038
- Ok. Have fun.

21:56.273 --> 21:59.401
Chase, would you rather eat 5
pounds of raw liver

21:59.484 --> 22:01.528
or wear a bikini to class?

22:01.611 --> 22:02.779
- Bikini to class, no question.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.865
- Really?

22:04.948 --> 22:06.074
- Oh, yeah. I look hot
in a bikini.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.202
- Ok. Don't wanna know
how you know that.

Sandy, would you rather

22:17.627 --> 22:19.838
shave your head
completely bald

22:19.921 --> 22:22.466
or drink 5 bottles
of ketchup?

22:22.549 --> 22:24.885
- Can I hide in my room
until my hair grows back?

22:24.968 --> 22:27.471
- Nope.
- I'd drink the ketchup.

22:27.554 --> 22:28.430
[laughing]

22:28.513 --> 22:31.391
- Ok. Zoey, would you rather

22:31.475 --> 22:34.061
be stuck in an elevator
for 3 days

22:34.144 --> 22:37.230
or...make out with a monkey?

22:37.314 --> 22:39.566
- Stuck in an elevator.
I ain't kissing a monkey.

22:39.649 --> 22:41.610
- Baby.
- Let's see you kiss a monkey.

22:41.693 --> 22:44.780
- Bring me a monkey.
- Maybe I will.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.615
{\an8}- Yeah, yeah, all right,
Dustin,

22:46.698 --> 22:50.118
{\an8}would you rather chew
off your own fingers

22:50.202 --> 22:52.037
{\an8}or be married
to an elephant?

22:52.120 --> 22:53.622
{\an8}DUSTIN: Isn't that illegal?

22:53.705 --> 22:55.415
{\an8}CHASE: Not in international
waters.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.876
{\an8}DUSTIN: Ah.
ZOEY: [giggles]

23:23.401 --> 23:26.363
[ding]
<i>MAN: Mmm!</i>

23:26.446 --> 23:27.656
<i>Zoey: She's offering pie.</i>
