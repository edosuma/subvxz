WEBVTT

00:05.405 --> 00:07.608
HI, YOU WANNA TRY
THE NEW FRAGRANCE
FOR BRITNEY SPEARS?

00:07.674 --> 00:11.445
"CURIOUS."
ARE YOU CURIOUS?

00:11.512 --> 00:13.680
TRY "ENCHANTING"
BY CELINE DION.

00:13.747 --> 00:16.083
IT'LL GIVE YOU
A SMELL.

00:17.818 --> 00:20.487
‐ WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.
‐ WE DON'T. YOU DO.

00:20.554 --> 00:21.922
IT'S YOUR AUDITION,
GEORGIA.

00:21.989 --> 00:23.857
THIS IS NOT JUST
ANY AUDITION, JO.

00:23.924 --> 00:25.959
THIS IS "DAMN YANKEES"
ON BROADWAY.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.761
AND LOLA IS MY
SIGNATURE ROLE.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.863
WORKING HERE IS NOT
WHAT I MEANT WHEN I SAID
I WAS COMING TO NEW YORK

00:29.930 --> 00:33.567
TO FIND MY DESTINY.
"DESTINY," "DESTINY."

00:33.634 --> 00:37.037
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
OUR BREAK'S AT NOON.
WE'LL GO THEN.

00:37.104 --> 00:41.008
SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN
MY ROLE BY THEN, JO.

00:41.074 --> 00:42.342
SO I WAS THINKING

00:42.409 --> 00:45.312
THAT MAYBE WE CAN JUST,
YOU KNOW, GO TO "PLAN B."

00:45.379 --> 00:46.713
NO, I HATE PLAN B.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.850
I WANNA GO MY WHOLE LIFE
WITHOUT HAVING TO DO PLAN B.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.718
OKAY,
THEN WE WON'T DO IT.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.220
‐ REALLY?
‐ NO.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.355
( gasps )

00:55.422 --> 00:57.758
MY ALLERGIES!
( whimpers )

00:57.824 --> 00:59.660
SKIN BLOTCHING.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.563
WORLD FADING,
STILL BASICALLY A VIRGIN.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.097
OH, YES!

01:04.164 --> 01:06.433
EMERGENCY!
EMERGENCY!

01:06.500 --> 01:08.302
HELLO, OKAY,
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

01:08.368 --> 01:09.736
WE GOTTA GO
TO THE HOSPITAL,
ALL RIGHT?

01:09.803 --> 01:11.171
SO WE'LL BE BACK
IN LIKE AN HOUR.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.539
UNLESS THERE
ARE CALLBACKS

01:12.606 --> 01:14.208
HOSPITAL CALLBACKS.
COME ON.

01:14.274 --> 01:15.909
CAN I JUST‐‐
I WANT MY EPI‐PEN.

01:15.976 --> 01:18.111
GIRL, I AM
IN A HURRY.
COME ON.

01:18.178 --> 01:20.781
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

01:32.726 --> 01:36.430
OH, MY GOODNESS,
I HAVE ARRIVED.
HELLO, LADIES.

01:36.496 --> 01:38.932
EXCUSE ME.
HI, HOW ARE YOU?

01:38.999 --> 01:42.002
OKAY, SO THIS IS
DAY, ALL RIGHT? CIAL

01:42.069 --> 01:44.838
BECAUSE YEARS FROM NOW
YOU'LL BE ABLE

01:44.905 --> 01:47.474
TO TELL YOUR GRANDKIDS
THAT YOU WERE IN THE ROOM

01:47.541 --> 01:51.411
WHEN GEORGIA CHAMBERLAIN
WAS DISCOVERED. HA!

01:52.679 --> 01:54.481
AND IT WAS ALSO
THE SAME DAY

01:54.548 --> 01:56.917
THAT HER BEST FRIEND
LOST ALL SENSATION

01:56.984 --> 01:59.620
IN HER THUMBS.

01:59.686 --> 02:02.155
THAT'S OKAY, SWEETHEART,
'CAUSE IF YOU LIKE SOMETHING,
I CAN JUST DO THIS FOR YOU.

02:05.158 --> 02:06.927
JOE...

02:06.994 --> 02:09.930
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE
LOLA SOMEPLACE TONIGHT?

02:09.997 --> 02:12.633
OKAY, I'M GONNA STOP YOU.

02:12.699 --> 02:14.101
BUT I'M‐‐

02:14.168 --> 02:16.436
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.
YOU'RE DESPERATE.

02:16.503 --> 02:20.340
YOU BEEN IN THE CITY,
WHAT, A YEAR AND A HALF,
TWO YEARS NOW?

02:20.407 --> 02:23.277
JOINED AN IMPROV GROUP
WITH A CUTE NAME.

02:23.343 --> 02:25.012
SOLD YOUR BEST BOOTS

02:25.078 --> 02:28.148
FOR THAT RHODE ISLAND
BOOB JOB.

02:28.215 --> 02:31.885
BUT YOUR YEARS
OF STRUGGLE ARE OVER

02:31.952 --> 02:33.754
BECAUSE I AM ABOUT
TO SAY THE WORDS

02:33.820 --> 02:35.589
THAT ARE GOING
TO CHANGE

02:35.656 --> 02:38.525
YOUR LIFE FOREVER.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.496
( whispers )
YOU DON'T HAVE IT.

02:44.198 --> 02:46.934
THAT'S JUST
YOUR OPINION.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.603
DO YOU NEED MY
INSANELY HOT GIRLFRIEND
TO SAY IT, TOO?

02:49.670 --> 02:52.339
I LIKE IT MORE
WHEN THEY CRY.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.611

04:02.476 --> 04:04.545

04:04.611 --> 04:07.114
I'VE ONLY
BEEN IN NEW YORK

04:07.181 --> 04:10.617

NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
SEE, I'VE PLAYED LOLA BEFORE.

04:16.123 --> 04:19.459
YOU'VE ALSO PLAYED "ANNIE,"
"EVITA" AND "THE PHANTOM."

04:19.526 --> 04:22.095
WHERE WAS THIS THEATER?
YOUR BASEMENT?

04:22.162 --> 04:25.465
NO, IT WAS IN COLLEGE.
AND I GOT EXCELLENT REVIEWS.

04:25.532 --> 04:28.235
HOW? DID YOUR DADDY
OWN THE PAPER?

04:28.302 --> 04:31.939
NO, HE OWNED THE COLLEGE

NO ONE WILL BUY YOU
AS A SEDUCTRESS

05:26.260 --> 05:30.197
BECAUSE IN "DAMN YANKEES"
WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT
THE BIG SEDUCTION SCENE,

05:30.264 --> 05:33.367
THEY DON'T MEAN
THE SIZE OF THE ACTRESS.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.475
WHAT DO GIRLS SAY
WHEN YOU SAY STUFF
LIKE THAT TO THEM?

05:41.542 --> 05:44.344
DO THEY GET SCARED?

05:44.411 --> 05:45.846
DO THEY CRY?

05:45.913 --> 05:47.347
NOT ME, SIR.

05:47.414 --> 05:50.050
AND YOU OUGHT TO BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELF

05:50.117 --> 05:52.920
SPEAKING TO A LADY
LIKE THAT.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.222
AND IT'S NOT "HONEY."

05:55.289 --> 05:57.057
IT'S GEORGIA.

05:57.124 --> 06:00.827
WITH A "G."
GEORGIA.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.130
AND TRUST ME,

06:03.197 --> 06:05.699
YOU WON'T FORGET IT.

06:13.674 --> 06:17.010
I WAS GONNA PUT
THIS PEN BACK,

06:17.077 --> 06:19.780
BUT NO.
NOW I AM KEEPING IT.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.260

06:33.327 --> 06:35.596

06:40.167 --> 06:42.135
OUR SHIFT'S
ALMOST OVER.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.505
I KNOW WHAT'LL
CHEER YOU UP.

06:44.571 --> 06:48.575
LET'S GO THE BRIDAL REGISTRY
AND PLAY "WHICH COUPLE
ISN'T GONNA MAKE IT."

06:52.179 --> 06:54.815
‐ OR WE CAN PLAY
HIDE AND SEEK. I'LL HIDE.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.119
‐ JO, IS IT THAT GUY?
‐ HMM?

06:59.186 --> 07:00.754
NO, NO, NO,
IT'S NOT THAT GUY.

07:00.821 --> 07:03.156
JO.

07:04.491 --> 07:06.827
WHY ARE YOU
BLUSHING THEN?

07:06.894 --> 07:08.462

07:08.529 --> 07:10.998

VERY SERIOUSLY.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.367

YOU'RE JO PYE,
AREN'T YOU?

07:22.843 --> 07:26.747
( British accent )
NO, NO, I'M NOT JO PYE.

07:26.813 --> 07:29.750
YES, SHE IS.
AND SHE LIKES YOU.

07:29.816 --> 07:31.418
I REMEMBER
YOUR PICTURE.

07:31.485 --> 07:34.655
YOUR HAIR IS VERY,
UH‐‐ MEMORABLE.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.925
SHE HAS
A SYNDROME.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.127
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
COMING IN FOR YOUR
INTERVIEW.

07:40.194 --> 07:44.131
I WILL GET BACK
TO YOU ON THAT.

07:44.198 --> 07:47.801
WE GOTTA GO.
HAVE A GREAT
SHOPPING EXPERIENCE.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.270
JO'S GOT A BOYFRIEND.
( giggles )

07:50.337 --> 07:52.172
IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.441
HE'S THE HEAD
OF PHYSICS DEPARTMENT.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.844
THE APPLICATION WENT WELL.
EVERYTHING WAS FINE.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.679
I JUST HAD TO GO
FOR AN INTERVIEW.
THAT WAS IT.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.614
OKAY, THEN
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:00.681 --> 08:02.816
WELL, YEAH,
IT IS KIND OF COOL

08:02.883 --> 08:05.252
HAVING A BETA PARTICLE
NAMED AFTER YOU.

08:05.319 --> 08:08.555
ONCE YOU'VE BEEN PUBLISHED
FOR THE THIRD TIME IN
THE "JOURNAL OF PHYSICS,"

08:08.622 --> 08:09.857
YOU'RE KIND OF
OVER IT.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.558
I ALMOST DIED
WHEN I SAW THAT HEADLINE.

08:11.625 --> 08:14.795
'CAUSE THE MacARTHUR PEOPLE
HATE IT WHEN YOU CALL IT
A "GENIUS GRANT."

08:16.129 --> 08:18.432
I HAVE SOME MILK
THAT'S ABOUT TO EXPIRE

08:18.498 --> 08:20.501
SO I SHOULD
PROBABLY GO.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.005
THAT'S IT?

08:25.072 --> 08:26.340
YOU JUST RAN
OUT OF THERE?

08:26.406 --> 08:29.776
YES, EVERYONE HAD
THESE IVY LEAGUE
DEGREES,

08:29.843 --> 08:34.648
AND THEY'D ALL BEEN
PUBLISHED AND THEIR HAIR
WAS CLEARLY COMBABLE.

08:34.715 --> 08:38.151
JO, THAT GUY
PRACTICALLY ROLLED OUT
THE RED CARPET FOR YOU.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.053
DO YOU SEE WHAT I
HAVE TO DO TO GET
MY FOOT IN THE DOOR?

08:40.120 --> 08:42.422
‐ BUT I'M NOT LIKE YOU,
GEORGIA.
‐ MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE

08:42.489 --> 08:45.158
SO ONE OF US CAN ACTUALLY
DO SOMETHING IN THIS TOWN.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.094
WHAT IS ALL
THIS SHOUTING?

08:47.160 --> 08:50.864
MODULATE, LADIES.
MODULATE.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.966
I'M SORRY,
AUNT HONEY.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.368
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

08:54.434 --> 08:56.937
OH, SO SORRY
TO POP IN LIKE THIS.

08:57.004 --> 09:00.407
I TOLD YOU TO
THINK OF MY DOWNSTAIRS
APARTMENT AS YOUR OWN.

09:00.474 --> 09:03.043
AND I DO SO RESPECT
YOUR PRIVACY,

09:03.110 --> 09:05.345
BUT I HAD AN EVENTFUL
EVENING

09:05.412 --> 09:08.115
AND I THOUGHT IT BEST
TO GIVE MY GENTLEMEN CALLER

09:08.182 --> 09:10.317
A LITTLE TIME
TO HIMSELF.

09:10.384 --> 09:13.120
IT'S 5:00
IN THE AFTERNOON.

09:13.187 --> 09:15.322
( giggles ) 
I KNOW.

09:17.157 --> 09:20.394
THE INSTRUCTIONS
ON THE PACKAGE SAY THAT
NOW IS AROUND THE TIME

09:20.460 --> 09:21.728
YOU SHOULD CALL
THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.263
HMM.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.599
LIFE'S SUCH
A CRAP SHOOT.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.434
Aunt Honey:
<i>OOH!</i>

09:27.501 --> 09:30.270
SO HOW WAS
YOUR AUDITION, DEAR?

09:30.337 --> 09:32.806
THERE WAS NONE.
HE WOULDN'T LET ME READ.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.442
AND HE SAID HORRIBLE THINGS
TO ME EVEN AFTER I SANG.

09:35.509 --> 09:39.112
OH, WELL,
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
GO OVER HIS HEAD.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.448
I'LL CALL SOME
OF MY JEWISH FRIENDS.

09:41.515 --> 09:43.483
THEY'RE VERY INVOLVED
IN THE ARTS.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.421
NO, TRENT PIERCE
KNOWS CASTING.

09:47.487 --> 09:50.424
AND IF HE SAYS
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE IT,

09:50.490 --> 09:53.961
THEN... I GUESS I'M JUST
FOOLING MYSELF.

09:54.027 --> 09:57.397
GEORGIA, WAIT.
GEORGIA.

09:57.464 --> 09:58.899
BEFORE YOUR
MOTHER PASSED,

09:58.966 --> 10:02.069
I SWORE TO HER THAT I'D
LOOK AFTER YOU AS MY OWN.

10:02.135 --> 10:05.906
AUNT HONEY, YOU CAN'T
FIX THIS FOR ME.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.342
AND I'M NOT GOING TO.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.444
YOU ARE
A SOUTHERN WOMAN.

10:10.511 --> 10:15.115
AND SOUTHERN WOMEN DO NOT
FALL APART AT THE FIRST
SIGN OF ADVERSITY.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.484
DID I FALL APART
WHEN I DROPPED MY BATON

10:17.551 --> 10:20.921
‐ IN THE MISS GEORGIA
PEACH PAGEANT?
‐ UM‐UM.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.422
DID YOUR MAMA
FALL APART

10:22.489 --> 10:25.325
WHEN YOUR DADDY
DIDN'T EVEN TAKE HER
TO THE MAGNOLIA BALL?

10:25.392 --> 10:29.096
DID YOUR GREAT‐GRANDMA
FALL APART WHEN FDR WENT
BACK TO ELEANOR?

10:29.162 --> 10:31.265
NO.

10:31.331 --> 10:35.636
SO YOU STOP
FEELING SORRY
FOR YOURSELF, HMM?

10:35.702 --> 10:40.040
AND YOU THINK OF ALL
THE WONDERFUL GIFTS
GOD HAS GIVEN YOU

10:40.107 --> 10:42.042
AND YOU USE THEM.

10:42.109 --> 10:45.946
I'M GONNA TIE STRINGS

11:18.612 --> 11:21.949
I DO NOT HAVE A GUN.
I HAVE A PICNIC.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.618
I JUST THOUGHT
THAT A HARDWORKING MAN
LIKE YOURSELF

11:24.685 --> 11:27.187
DESERVES
A WELL‐COOKED MEAL.

11:27.254 --> 11:31.191
SO I MADE US
SOME FRIED CHICKEN,
