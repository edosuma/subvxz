00:01.290 --> 00:02.357
LINDSAY: Previously
on The Practice:

00:02.391 --> 00:04.993
If he takes me out, I don't
want you to let him walk.

00:05.026 --> 00:07.529
If I'm dead, you let
someone know what happened.

00:07.562 --> 00:09.864
Russell said if anything
happened to him,

00:09.898 --> 00:11.800
tell the police
about Derek Grant.

00:11.833 --> 00:14.102
The client told you what
happened in confidence.

00:14.135 --> 00:15.770
It won't matter
if he's dead!

00:15.804 --> 00:17.772
There's a man
named Derek Grant.

00:17.806 --> 00:19.641
We're asking you
to question the guy.

00:19.674 --> 00:21.576
Derek Grant was shot
to death two nights ago

00:21.610 --> 00:23.211
on the corner
of 128 and Linden.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.780
You ordered me to tell
the police!

00:25.814 --> 00:26.948
If I was dead!

00:26.981 --> 00:27.816
I thought you were dead!

00:27.849 --> 00:29.551
Russell Hampton,
you're under arrest

00:29.584 --> 00:30.685
for the murder of Derek Grant.

00:30.719 --> 00:32.686
You have the right
to remain silent.

00:32.720 --> 00:35.424
When this started, all they
had was a dime bag of crack.

00:35.457 --> 00:36.525
They couldn't charge you
with murder

00:36.558 --> 00:37.659
if you didn't keep
killing people!

00:37.692 --> 00:39.193
You gave me up!

00:39.227 --> 00:40.495
(yells)

00:41.162 --> 00:42.397
(grunting)

00:43.398 --> 00:44.699
(door bangs open)

00:46.335 --> 00:47.802
Get in there!

00:47.836 --> 00:49.538
Go! Get him out!

00:49.571 --> 00:50.939
Gotta get him out.

00:50.972 --> 00:52.341
Aah!

00:53.107 --> 00:54.142
You should get some rest.

00:54.175 --> 00:55.677
I'm fine.

00:56.978 --> 00:58.613
You guys
don't need to worry.

01:05.687 --> 01:07.889
Your cellmate, dead.

01:09.123 --> 01:11.560
Your fingerprints
on the knife.

01:12.961 --> 01:15.664
Your confession
to the murder.

01:17.932 --> 01:20.001
We don't win this one, Ray.

01:20.034 --> 01:22.737
This is a case we plead to.

01:24.506 --> 01:25.940
Go over it again.

01:25.974 --> 01:26.975
This is getting
really boring.

01:27.008 --> 01:29.578
Not to me.
I love court days.

01:29.611 --> 01:31.145
Beats watching TV.

01:31.179 --> 01:33.014
Food's better than
state prison.

01:34.148 --> 01:35.750
I can hit on you.
Guard!

01:35.784 --> 01:37.419
No! No, don't
call the guards.

01:38.286 --> 01:39.821
I know about the guards.

01:39.854 --> 01:41.690
Don't screw around
with me, Ray.

01:41.723 --> 01:43.925
I didn't tell you before
'cause I was scared you
wouldn't believe me.

01:51.966 --> 01:55.069
The guards set up fights
between the inmates
and bet on 'em.

01:56.505 --> 01:58.239
They wanted me
to fight Baumann.

01:58.272 --> 02:01.610
But before I could tell
anyone, they killed him.

02:04.779 --> 02:07.115
Are you saying
they framed you?

02:07.148 --> 02:09.383
You don't rat out
the guards and live.

02:09.418 --> 02:11.252
But I got no choice.

02:11.285 --> 02:12.854
I can't do more prison time.

02:13.922 --> 02:15.790
If you're saying
you have a defense,

02:15.824 --> 02:17.191
I need to know.

02:22.497 --> 02:23.732
Is this true?

02:29.838 --> 02:32.907
No. But I sure as hell
had you going.

02:32.941 --> 02:34.075
You're an idiot.

02:34.108 --> 02:35.777
Come on, it's a winner!
We can get a jury to buy it.

02:35.810 --> 02:36.645
We've done it before.

02:36.678 --> 02:39.681
When we had a defense, Ray.

02:42.384 --> 02:46.321
Look... if I can get
a plea deal to ten years

02:46.355 --> 02:47.589
on top
of your current sentence--

02:47.622 --> 02:48.523
Ten?

02:50.559 --> 02:54.796
Plus three
on my robbery charge?

02:54.829 --> 02:57.332
I can't do 13 years.

02:57.366 --> 02:59.434
I was serious about that.

02:59.468 --> 03:01.403
I can't do
the time I got left.

03:03.405 --> 03:07.342
Ray, when you get convicted
this time,

03:07.376 --> 03:10.345
it's mandatory life.

03:12.213 --> 03:14.816
So you either let me
make a deal,

03:14.849 --> 03:16.785
or you'll have to start
getting used to the idea

03:16.818 --> 03:19.921
that you are going to die
in prison.

03:21.290 --> 03:22.557
It's your choice.

03:27.362 --> 03:30.365
(music playing)

04:15.276 --> 04:16.845
There's nothing
you can challenge?

04:16.878 --> 04:20.449
His confession was voluntary
and vividly incriminating.

04:20.482 --> 04:22.116
And you can forget
self-defense.

04:22.150 --> 04:25.186
He admitted the victim was
asleep when he stabbed him.

04:25.219 --> 04:27.756
Why did he do it?
He won't tell me.

04:27.789 --> 04:29.791
How many times you've
represented this guy?

04:29.824 --> 04:31.192
Well, this makes four.

04:31.225 --> 04:33.061
And to be honest,
I've always liked the guy,

04:33.094 --> 04:36.298
but since he's been in prison...
I don't know.

04:36.331 --> 04:38.933
After a while,
it drives them all crazy.

04:38.967 --> 04:41.235
He's agreed to let me try
and plead it.

04:46.708 --> 04:47.876
Good morning?

04:52.847 --> 04:54.616
What the hell are you
doing here?

04:54.649 --> 04:56.250
I told you
he'd come back too fast.

04:56.284 --> 04:59.120
Hello to you, too, everyone.
It's good to be back.

04:59.153 --> 05:01.423
Hey, Bobby, you look...

05:02.924 --> 05:05.294
...bad.
LUCY: Nice, Jimmy.

05:05.327 --> 05:07.796
Why don't you drop
the macho crap and go home?

05:07.829 --> 05:09.964
Lucy, get me
the Cheswick file.

05:09.998 --> 05:11.366
When Eugene gets in,

05:11.400 --> 05:13.201
tell him we need
to go over the finances.

05:24.479 --> 05:27.416
No deal.
My case is way too strong.

05:27.449 --> 05:29.117
Can't you just once be
reasonable?

05:29.150 --> 05:31.820
If he pleads,
he will serve 13 years

05:31.853 --> 05:33.855
before he's even
considered for parole.

05:33.888 --> 05:34.989
He committed
coldblooded murder!

05:35.023 --> 05:37.158
He ought to stay in prison
for life.

05:37.191 --> 05:38.527
Plus, it's only
a one-day trial.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.162
Ellenor, don't beg this guy.

05:41.195 --> 05:42.697
You got a real stick
up your ass.

05:42.731 --> 05:44.265
Shut up, Ray!

05:44.299 --> 05:45.367
You know why I bet you suck?

05:47.669 --> 05:49.203
Because people hate
arrogant.

05:50.138 --> 05:52.607
Now, me-- juries love me.

05:52.641 --> 05:53.975
That last jury loved you.

05:54.008 --> 05:56.044
I pled to the robbery charge.
I had no choice.

05:56.077 --> 05:57.579
They had me on videotape.

05:57.612 --> 06:00.114
I've never been convicted
by a jury.

06:02.617 --> 06:04.285
We can beat this chump.

06:05.587 --> 06:07.989
No, we can't.

06:15.664 --> 06:16.565
(door closes)

06:16.598 --> 06:18.933
(typing)

06:20.502 --> 06:21.370
(sighs)

06:21.403 --> 06:22.871
Collections are down.

06:22.904 --> 06:26.140
Welcome to the recession.
Clients are hurting.

06:26.174 --> 06:28.910
Some firms in town are taking
50 cents on the dollar.

06:28.943 --> 06:30.312
I can't afford
to be out anymore.

06:31.079 --> 06:33.047
Anybody out there need
my help?

06:33.081 --> 06:35.550
Ellenor's got a trial
that's gonna plead.

06:35.584 --> 06:37.151
Everybody else is covered.

06:39.153 --> 06:40.522
What's your schedule?

06:41.723 --> 06:42.924
Don't you start now.

06:42.957 --> 06:45.193
For now,
you shouldn't be taking

06:45.226 --> 06:46.561
any criminal cases, Bobby.

06:46.961 --> 06:48.062
Excuse me?

06:48.096 --> 06:50.164
Before you go back into
a cell with another client,

06:50.198 --> 06:53.234
we think it would be best
for you to get your legs back.

06:53.435 --> 06:54.536
"We think"?

06:54.569 --> 06:56.905
Bobby--
Wait a second.

06:56.938 --> 06:58.640
You and Lindsay got together
and decided

06:58.673 --> 07:00.174
how I should practice law?

07:00.208 --> 07:03.412
No. The whole firm
decided this.

07:03.445 --> 07:05.279
Well, do me a favor.

07:05.314 --> 07:08.249
Next time my firm plans on
discussing my career,

07:08.282 --> 07:10.985
let me know.
I'd like to be there.

07:26.234 --> 07:27.369
Give him time.

07:29.638 --> 07:32.674
He won't give himself time.

07:32.707 --> 07:35.310
He won't even talk
about what happened.

07:35.344 --> 07:37.178
You know, your husband's
not real big

07:37.211 --> 07:39.314
on sharing his feelings.
Oh.

07:39.348 --> 07:41.316
Or hadn't you noticed?

07:41.350 --> 07:44.319
I noticed that he feels
like we're attacking him.

07:45.286 --> 07:46.988
He probably does.

07:47.322 --> 07:49.724
Right now, he's something
he never wanted to be:

07:49.758 --> 07:50.759
A victim.

07:51.793 --> 07:53.295
It's not easy
for him to deal with.

07:54.529 --> 07:55.630
You know that.

08:05.106 --> 08:07.709
When I defended him before,
he listened to me.

08:07.742 --> 08:11.580
Now he won't take my advice
or help me develop
a usable defense.

08:11.613 --> 08:13.982
I can't, in good conscience,
continue to be his lawyer.

08:14.015 --> 08:15.917
This is a ploy to get
a continuance.

08:15.950 --> 08:18.387
Mr. Lowe knows
I have a real conflict.

08:18.420 --> 08:20.522
I know your client
doesn't have a defense.

08:20.555 --> 08:21.923
I don't care what you know.

08:21.956 --> 08:24.859
I care about Mr. McMurphy.
He's the one facing trial.

08:24.893 --> 08:29.163
Sir, are you and Ms. Frutt
having problems?

08:30.198 --> 08:31.666
Thank you for asking,
Your Honor.

08:35.504 --> 08:37.772
Sorry. I get nervous.

08:37.806 --> 08:40.775
That's all right, son.
Take your time.

08:40.808 --> 08:44.044
It's just that...
she wants me to plead guilty,

08:44.078 --> 08:45.914
and I want my day in court.

08:47.115 --> 08:48.783
Are you pressuring him
to plead?

08:48.817 --> 08:50.218
Frankly, yes.

08:50.251 --> 08:52.754
As his lawyer, I have a duty
to stop him from pursuing

08:52.787 --> 08:54.889
a trial he can't win.

08:54.923 --> 08:56.958
But that's his choice,
not yours.

08:56.991 --> 08:58.693
If he wants a trial,
he gets a trial.

08:58.727 --> 09:00.329
Not with me as his lawyer.

09:00.362 --> 09:02.431
We have a conflict.
Let him get new counsel.

09:02.464 --> 09:04.065
We're ready today.

09:04.098 --> 09:05.467
Bringing in a new lawyer
will delay the case

09:05.500 --> 09:06.801
for months, maybe a year.

09:06.835 --> 09:07.902
No!

09:09.538 --> 09:11.205
I don't want to go
back upstate right now.

09:12.006 --> 09:13.442
I want a trial today.

09:16.044 --> 09:18.547
I'll be my own lawyer.
I'll defend myself.

09:20.214 --> 09:22.517
That is a bad idea.
That's also a ploy.

09:22.551 --> 09:24.853
After he's convicted,
he'll appeal

09:24.886 --> 09:26.455
and say that we violated
his right to counsel.

09:26.488 --> 09:27.889
I'll waive that appeal.

09:27.922 --> 09:29.858
And later say that
the waiver was unknowing.

09:29.891 --> 09:32.394
No! I can have Ms. Frutt
advise me.

09:32.427 --> 09:33.828
Then I'll waive it,

09:33.862 --> 09:35.530
which means
it will be knowing.

09:35.564 --> 09:38.467
Sir, I advise you
not to represent yourself.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.235
If you choose--
But...

09:42.604 --> 09:44.739
...I have a right to.

09:44.773 --> 09:45.774
Don't I?

09:48.843 --> 09:50.912
I choose to exercise
that right.

09:53.582 --> 09:55.149
May I have one second,
Your Honor?

09:57.452 --> 09:58.887
What are you doing?

09:58.920 --> 10:01.356
I wanna go to trial now,
with or without you.

10:01.390 --> 10:04.726
Ray, you may be nuts,
but you are not crazy.

10:04.759 --> 10:07.429
Which means my wish
should be respected.

10:07.462 --> 10:09.964
You will be convicted!

10:09.998 --> 10:12.801
Ellenor... no, I won't.

10:21.576 --> 10:23.211
He wants to represent
himself, Your Honor.

10:24.012 --> 10:26.981
Fine. But he'll do so
with hybrid representation.

10:27.015 --> 10:29.117
Ms. Frutt, I'm ordering you
to assist him

10:29.150 --> 10:31.085
as standby counsel.
What?

10:31.119 --> 10:33.988
The law says
he can do it pro se,

10:34.022 --> 10:35.023
but I'm allowed
to protect him.

10:35.056 --> 10:36.558
Let him get somebody else.

10:37.459 --> 10:39.093
No. I have you.

10:40.329 --> 10:43.532
Mr. McMurphy, once again,
I must warn you

10:43.565 --> 10:46.335
that defending yourself
is a very serious step.

10:46.368 --> 10:48.269
Are you sure
it's one you want to take?

10:48.303 --> 10:50.038
Yes.

10:50.071 --> 10:51.940
I-I've been through
enough trials

10:51.973 --> 10:56.077
to know how they work.
I can do this... with help.

10:56.110 --> 10:59.414
I object to being forced
to help a man convict himself.

10:59.448 --> 11:01.450
I think what you
object to, Ms. Frutt,

11:01.483 --> 11:03.985
is the client taking
control of his case,

11:04.018 --> 11:06.588
but that's his right.
He's the one in charge, not you.

11:06.621 --> 11:09.791
Therefore, you will serve
as standby counsel,

11:09.824 --> 11:12.494
and Mr. McMurphy will have
his day in court.

11:12.527 --> 11:14.228
See you at 11:00.

11:14.262 --> 11:15.129
(gavel bangs)

11:30.479 --> 11:31.846
LUCY: So he's defending himself?

11:31.880 --> 11:33.247
Not my idea.

11:33.281 --> 11:34.483
You still
have to be there?

11:34.516 --> 11:37.752
Yes. He wants copies
of the local rules,

11:37.786 --> 11:39.153
a textbook on criminal
procedures,

11:39.187 --> 11:40.422
and the evidence code.

11:40.455 --> 11:42.223
And you have to hurry.
It starts in two hours.

11:42.256 --> 11:43.825
So you're second chair
to him?

11:43.858 --> 11:45.294
Lucy, hurry!

11:50.432 --> 11:53.234
If you don't wear it,
you will look guilty.

11:53.267 --> 11:55.169
Ellenor, they're gonna know
I'm in prison

11:55.203 --> 11:56.871
when they hear
where I killed him.

11:56.905 --> 11:58.840
Me wearing that
will just look phony.

11:59.774 --> 12:01.710
Now, can we talk
about the trial?

12:01.743 --> 12:04.045
Go ahead.
You're in charge.

12:04.078 --> 12:06.381
That judge seems like
a liberal.

12:06.415 --> 12:08.783
He is, particularly
at sentencing,

12:08.817 --> 12:10.785
which is why
you should plead.

12:10.819 --> 12:13.221
A conviction takes away
his discretion.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.890
But if I waive jury
and have him decide it,

12:15.924 --> 12:17.025
will he acquit me?

12:18.893 --> 12:20.295
No.

12:20.329 --> 12:22.063
You're better off
with a jury.

12:22.096 --> 12:23.598
You still say frame-up
and self-defense are out?

12:23.632 --> 12:24.799
Completely.

12:24.833 --> 12:26.200
What other defenses
do we have?

12:26.868 --> 12:28.570
Listen, Ray,
even as your backup counsel,

12:28.603 --> 12:29.704
I can't let you just--

12:29.738 --> 12:31.706
But as my advisor,

12:32.006 --> 12:34.743
you at least have to tell me
what my options are.

12:39.113 --> 12:39.981
Alibi--

12:40.014 --> 12:41.550
you were somewhere else,
which won't work,

12:41.583 --> 12:43.785
because you were locked
in a cell.

12:45.019 --> 12:46.321
Go on.
Insanity--

12:46.355 --> 12:47.756
the prison shrink
says you're not.

12:47.789 --> 12:50.058
Necessity-- not applicable
on these facts.

12:50.091 --> 12:52.193
Jury nullification--
it's illegal to even--

12:52.226 --> 12:53.194
Uh, go back.

12:54.996 --> 12:57.198
What's a necessity defense?
It doesn't work--

12:57.231 --> 12:58.600
Just tell me what is!!

13:05.106 --> 13:09.143
You killed him because
somebody forced you to.

13:10.612 --> 13:11.913
That's my defense.

13:11.946 --> 13:14.616
No, it's not, Ray.
Nobody forced you to--

13:14.649 --> 13:17.386
Ellenor, you know how
you survive in prison?

13:17.419 --> 13:19.621
You grab opportunities.

13:22.324 --> 13:24.726
Now get me some cases
on necessity.

13:30.231 --> 13:32.266
Trial on the defendant's
assault charge

13:32.301 --> 13:33.535
was to begin last week,

13:33.568 --> 13:35.337
but Mr. Donnell
was in the hospital

13:35.370 --> 13:36.971
as the result
of another case.

13:37.005 --> 13:38.473
Third continuance,
Mr. Donnell--

13:38.507 --> 13:40.642
When will you be
back in the saddle?

13:40.675 --> 13:42.511
I'm back now, Judge.

13:42.544 --> 13:43.845
Well, then, you're in luck.

13:43.878 --> 13:46.781
We had a case plead out.
We can take you today.

13:47.916 --> 13:49.150
Today?

13:54.356 --> 13:56.525
Can I have a moment
with my client?

13:58.993 --> 13:59.661
Sure.

14:05.500 --> 14:08.202
What do you want to do?
Get it over with.

14:11.940 --> 14:14.443
Well, we don't
have to go today.

14:14.476 --> 14:17.245
Under the law,
you're entitled to more time.

14:18.012 --> 14:19.348
Do I want more time?

14:20.449 --> 14:21.850
It never hurts.

14:21.883 --> 14:23.552
It gives us a chance to...

14:25.119 --> 14:27.356
...keep investigating
your defense.

14:28.256 --> 14:30.692
Judge Bournes,
may I be heard?

14:31.560 --> 14:34.128
I've just realized I have
a scheduling conflict.

14:34.162 --> 14:36.398
A later date
would be better for me.

14:36.431 --> 14:39.768
How about, uh...
June 6th?

14:41.035 --> 14:42.437
Okay with your client,
Mr. Donnell?

14:45.974 --> 14:47.041
Yes, that would be fine.

14:47.809 --> 14:50.545
See you in June.
We're adjourned.

14:51.346 --> 14:52.681
Bobby, we need to talk.

14:52.714 --> 14:54.383
Yeah... later.

14:58.286 --> 14:59.921
You take care of yourself.

15:05.494 --> 15:07.429
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

15:07.462 --> 15:10.799
Mr. McMurphy
will be acting pro se--

15:10.832 --> 15:13.167
that is, as his own attorney.

15:13.201 --> 15:14.969
The law requires him
to comply

15:15.003 --> 15:17.372
with all evidentiary
and court rules.

15:17.406 --> 15:21.242
Ms. Frutt will be assisting
him as standby counsel.

15:21.275 --> 15:24.879
Now, certainly, Mr. McMurphy
has little or no experience

15:24.913 --> 15:26.315
in trying cases.

15:26.348 --> 15:29.751
You are to draw no inferences
or conclusions

15:29.784 --> 15:31.920
as to the merits of the case

15:31.953 --> 15:35.223
based on his performance
as a litigator.

15:37.058 --> 15:39.127
MAN: We roll the cell
doors open at 5:00 a. m.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.062
for the day's first count.

15:41.095 --> 15:43.532
McMurphy walked out.
Baumann didn't.

15:43.565 --> 15:44.999
What did you do?

15:45.033 --> 15:45.867
Checked the cell.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.836
Baumann was dead
in his bunk,

15:47.869 --> 15:49.938
the shiv still sticking
out of his chest.

15:49.971 --> 15:52.106
Where was Mr. McMurphy?

15:52.140 --> 15:53.642
Toeing the line
in front of the cell.

15:54.709 --> 15:56.445
There was blood
on his shirt.

15:56.478 --> 15:58.513
Could you tell if there'd been
a fight in the cell?

15:58.547 --> 16:00.382
Object--
lacks sufficient foundation.

16:00.415 --> 16:02.551
Object!

16:02.584 --> 16:04.453
Something... foundation.

16:04.486 --> 16:06.755
The objection is sustained.

16:06.788 --> 16:08.823
Was anything broken?

16:08.857 --> 16:10.659
Were there things
strewn around?

16:10.692 --> 16:13.127
It didn't look like a fight
had taken place, no.

16:13.695 --> 16:14.763
Thank you.

16:14.796 --> 16:15.464
Nothing further.

16:16.097 --> 16:17.198
He got to say it anyway.

16:17.231 --> 16:19.000
Good witnesses know how.

16:21.403 --> 16:23.338
Be careful.

16:29.978 --> 16:31.346
Saunders.

16:31.380 --> 16:32.481
McMurphy.

16:33.315 --> 16:34.483
First thing you did,

16:34.516 --> 16:36.818
you took me to
the deputy warden's office,

16:36.851 --> 16:39.253
and I told you
I had to kill him.

16:39.287 --> 16:41.255
Objection!
Lacks foundation.

16:41.290 --> 16:42.857
Mr. McMurphy
is not the witness here.

16:42.891 --> 16:45.794
Sustained.
The jury will disregard.

16:46.561 --> 16:48.096
You hate my guts, right?

16:48.129 --> 16:49.097
I hate killers.

16:49.130 --> 16:50.299
Objection!

16:50.332 --> 16:51.966
Sit down, Ms. Frutt.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.802
You hated me because
I wouldn't kiss your ass.

16:53.835 --> 16:55.337
You're a killer and a liar!

16:55.370 --> 16:57.939
That's enough!
The jury will disregard.

16:57.972 --> 16:59.941
I have nothing else
to ask this man.

17:06.948 --> 17:10.452
Did you ever suspect
anyone but the defendant

17:10.484 --> 17:11.152
of this murder?

17:11.185 --> 17:12.820
No.
Object to that.

17:12.854 --> 17:14.989
Shh! I want to hear this.

17:15.022 --> 17:17.559
Why didn't you suspect
anyone else?

17:17.592 --> 17:20.829
It's a two-man cell.
They were locked in overnight.

17:20.862 --> 17:22.431
Plus, McMurphy hated Baumann.

17:22.464 --> 17:23.097
Everyone knew it.

17:23.131 --> 17:24.566
That's a lie!
Your Honor--

17:24.598 --> 17:26.768
Sit down!
Other people hated Baumann!

17:26.800 --> 17:29.371
Mr. McMurphy hated him
the most.

17:29.404 --> 17:31.873
I don't know why.
I just know he did.

17:43.718 --> 17:44.953
Nice job, Ray.

17:50.459 --> 17:52.026
You know, if you're sitting
next to me,

17:52.060 --> 17:52.861
you gotta look like
you're supporting me.

17:52.894 --> 17:54.596
I am trying to, but--

17:54.629 --> 17:56.164
No, you're arguing,
and the jury sees it.

17:56.197 --> 17:58.266
I am telling you
when to object, Ray.

17:58.300 --> 18:00.168
I am trying to help.

18:02.136 --> 18:04.739
So... how'd that go?

18:05.807 --> 18:07.376
Terrible.

18:07.409 --> 18:09.444
In addition to time
and opportunity,

18:09.478 --> 18:11.980
he testified that
you didn't like the victim.

18:13.782 --> 18:17.051
You did establish
that the witness hates you.

18:17.085 --> 18:18.587
So in your closing,

18:18.620 --> 18:20.489
you'll want to remember that
and argue the bias.

18:22.657 --> 18:24.626
Now, for the warden
who is up next,

18:24.659 --> 18:26.227
here's a quick lesson
in hearsay--

18:26.260 --> 18:27.562
I know what hearsay is.

18:27.596 --> 18:29.598
Well, make sure you object.

18:29.631 --> 18:31.065
You probably
won't shut it down,

18:31.099 --> 18:33.668
but you need to preserve
the objection for appeal.

18:35.203 --> 18:37.372
Because his testimony
is going to kill you.

18:40.208 --> 18:41.710
As the deputy warden,

18:41.743 --> 18:43.978
I was in charge of
the initial investigation.

18:44.012 --> 18:46.448
On the day of the murder,
you spoke with the defendant?

18:46.481 --> 18:47.248
Yes.

18:47.281 --> 18:48.950
And what, if anything,
did he say?

18:48.983 --> 18:51.152
Objection-- hearsay.

18:51.185 --> 18:54.389
It's admissible
hearsay as a declaration
against interests,

18:54.423 --> 18:56.257
an admission
by party opponents.

18:56.291 --> 18:57.459
Overruled.

18:57.492 --> 18:59.027
He said he stabbed Baumann

18:59.060 --> 19:01.029
a couple of hours
after lights out.

19:02.030 --> 19:03.298
Recognize this?

19:03.332 --> 19:05.066
Yes. It's the murder weapon.

19:05.099 --> 19:08.202
It's a toothbrush,
filed down. Very common.

19:08.236 --> 19:09.671
You checked it for prints?

19:09.704 --> 19:12.674
Yes. Mr. McMurphy said
we'd find his on it.

19:12.707 --> 19:14.008
And we did.

19:14.509 --> 19:16.845
Did he say why he did it?
No.

19:16.878 --> 19:19.514
Did he say what, if anything,
Mr. Baumann was doing

19:19.548 --> 19:20.982
at the time he stabbed him?

19:21.015 --> 19:23.184
He said Baumann was sleeping.

19:23.217 --> 19:24.653
Thank you.

19:32.160 --> 19:34.195
When I talked to you
back in your office,

19:34.228 --> 19:35.830
I looked real scared.

19:35.864 --> 19:37.231
I was shaking, crying--

19:37.265 --> 19:39.401
Objection--
lacks foundation.

19:39.434 --> 19:41.202
Calls for hearsay.
You used hearsay.

19:41.235 --> 19:43.071
Mr. McMurphy is not
the witness.

19:43.104 --> 19:45.740
Shaking and crying
are both nonverbal,
self-serving statements

19:45.774 --> 19:47.709
which are
inadmissible hearsay.

19:47.742 --> 19:49.210
Objection sustained.

19:49.243 --> 19:51.279
So I'm not allowed to say
what happened?

19:51.313 --> 19:53.615
You're not
the witness here, sir.

19:53.648 --> 19:55.584
The objection is sustained.

19:57.586 --> 19:59.621
(sighs)

20:04.359 --> 20:07.061
Every question that he asks
helps my case.

20:07.095 --> 20:08.863
He's still in his jumpsuit,
for God's sake.

20:08.897 --> 20:11.032
He might as well wear a sign
that says "convict me."

20:11.065 --> 20:12.867
I'm just saying be careful.

20:12.901 --> 20:14.536
Of what?

20:14.569 --> 20:15.404
Well, I think the guy's

20:15.437 --> 20:17.639
smarter than
you give him credit for.

20:19.808 --> 20:21.242
What am I missing?

20:22.411 --> 20:24.012
Look...

20:24.879 --> 20:26.815
The guy may have no defense,

20:26.848 --> 20:28.417
but the jury
might be seeing that

20:28.450 --> 20:30.552
as a function of no one
defending him.

20:30.585 --> 20:32.754
I introduced his confession.

20:32.787 --> 20:34.789
The jury sees
there's no defense.

20:34.823 --> 20:36.858
What the jury sees
is you beating up

20:36.891 --> 20:39.193
a defenseless guy
who doesn't know the law.

20:39.227 --> 20:42.364
Don't let him be an underdog
in there, Alan.

20:42.397 --> 20:46.234
Remind the jury
that this guy would rip out
their hearts if he could.

20:47.268 --> 20:48.603
And ease off the objecting.

20:48.637 --> 20:51.340
Let him win
a few procedural points.

20:52.974 --> 20:54.876
You really think
I'm in a fight here?

20:54.909 --> 20:57.245
From what I saw, yes.

20:58.613 --> 21:01.149
Look, there's no such thing
as a laydown.

21:01.450 --> 21:05.286
This office has lost cases
to pro se defendants.

21:06.421 --> 21:08.122
My advice-- be careful.

21:14.629 --> 21:17.832
Are you going to testify?

21:17.866 --> 21:19.000
I haven't decided yet.

21:19.033 --> 21:20.835
Well, if you don't testify,
how do you intend to prove

21:20.869 --> 21:22.304
that you acted
out of necessity?

21:24.573 --> 21:26.708
Look, if I think
this defense is a lie,

21:26.741 --> 21:27.876
I have to tell the judge.

21:27.909 --> 21:29.043
You don't know
it is a lie.

21:29.077 --> 21:30.345
Don't treat me
like an idiot, Ray.

21:30.379 --> 21:31.546
Look, I'm trying the case.

21:31.580 --> 21:32.781
I don't have to
tell you anything.

21:36.985 --> 21:39.454
You want to be helpful?

21:39.488 --> 21:40.555
Get me this guy.

21:41.490 --> 21:43.124
He's being sentenced
downstairs.

21:43.157 --> 21:44.526
We know each other.

21:44.559 --> 21:46.795
He'll testify for me.

21:46.828 --> 21:48.229
Why are you doing this?

21:49.364 --> 21:50.399
Trial prep's real important.

21:50.432 --> 21:54.669
You know what I mean.

21:54.703 --> 21:56.771
You used to trust me, Ray.

21:56.805 --> 21:58.773
When I said,
"plead," you did.

21:58.807 --> 22:01.009
We only fought the ones
that we could win.

22:07.649 --> 22:08.983
Did I let you down?

22:10.785 --> 22:12.253
What's changed?

22:15.590 --> 22:16.291
(sighs)

22:16.958 --> 22:18.293
It's not you.

22:19.794 --> 22:22.631
More time in prison would be
a death sentence for me.

22:23.565 --> 22:26.868
Then why did you kill him?

22:27.602 --> 22:28.603
If...

22:29.971 --> 22:32.073
...I told you
I killed him over cigarettes

22:32.106 --> 22:34.309
because he stole
my last damn pack,

22:34.343 --> 22:36.110
you wouldn't believe me.

22:37.646 --> 22:39.113
Guys in prison
get killed over less.

22:39.147 --> 22:42.283
Guys get killed for looking
at somebody wrong.

22:43.385 --> 22:44.686
I can't take it anymore.

22:46.921 --> 22:48.590
The longer this trial lasts,

22:48.623 --> 22:50.925
the less time I got
to be in prison.

22:50.959 --> 22:53.562
Even if it's just for a day,
that's enough.

22:56.197 --> 22:58.400
You killed him
over cigarettes?

23:00.101 --> 23:03.037
I said... "if."

23:08.176 --> 23:09.644
(creaking)

23:09.678 --> 23:11.646
Cheswick's down
in the last one.

23:26.528 --> 23:27.329
Are you all right?

23:29.431 --> 23:30.632
Just tell him--

23:31.633 --> 23:32.734
tell him I got paged.

23:32.767 --> 23:34.369
I-I got a...

23:35.604 --> 23:36.938
I'll check with him later.

23:53.722 --> 23:54.523
(door opens)

23:58.360 --> 23:59.193
Hello.

24:00.395 --> 24:01.696
Is Bobby Donnell in?

24:01.996 --> 24:02.897
You are?

24:02.931 --> 24:03.932
Leonard Welish.

24:03.965 --> 24:05.667
I'm with the state's
outreach program.

24:06.301 --> 24:08.470
We're funded by the state
legislature.

24:08.503 --> 24:09.838
We help crime victims.

24:09.871 --> 24:12.774
Well, "victim" is not
a word he likes to hear.

24:12.807 --> 24:15.043
Anyway, he's already given his
statement to the DA.

24:15.076 --> 24:16.478
I'm not a lawyer, ma'am.

24:16.511 --> 24:18.580
I'm here just to make sure
that he's okay.

24:21.816 --> 24:23.117
This is your defense?

24:23.151 --> 24:24.653
He's telling you what
happened.

24:24.686 --> 24:25.887
I hated Baumann.

24:25.920 --> 24:27.922
Baumann screwed me
on a drug deal.

24:27.956 --> 24:32.193
I told McMurphy,
kill Baumann or
I'd kill McMurphy.

24:34.429 --> 24:35.564
Is any of that true?

24:35.597 --> 24:38.099
You calling me a liar?
Mark...

24:38.132 --> 24:41.069
yes, as a matter of fact,
I am calling you a liar.

24:41.102 --> 24:43.972
Ellenor, you got another way
to tell my story?

24:44.005 --> 24:45.374
You don't have a story.

24:45.407 --> 24:48.276
The jury is not gonna believe
a word he says.

24:48.310 --> 24:50.345
The jury's gonna believe
that he is a scary dude.

24:50.379 --> 24:52.481
They're gonna believe I would do
whatever he told me to do.

24:52.514 --> 24:54.449
They're gonna prosecute you
for perjury.

24:54.483 --> 24:56.318
First, I ain't lying.

24:56.351 --> 24:59.688
Second, I'm serving three
consecutive life terms.

24:59.721 --> 25:01.523
I'm not real worried
about perjury.

25:01.556 --> 25:03.725
Ellenor, think about it.

25:03.758 --> 25:05.860
If he testifies,
then I don't have to.

25:05.894 --> 25:07.329
Ray--
That's the beauty of it.

25:07.362 --> 25:09.631
In my other trials,
you said it was iffy
if I testify.

25:09.664 --> 25:12.367
You said it was bad for the jury
to hear about my priors.

25:12.401 --> 25:15.269
Yes, but--
Now I got another prior--
the robbery.

25:15.304 --> 25:18.072
If I testify, Lowe
gets to cross-examine me,

25:18.106 --> 25:19.007
my priors come in.

25:19.474 --> 25:21.843
I can't let you
obstruct justice.

25:21.876 --> 25:25.714
You said juries convict
guys based on priors.

25:25.747 --> 25:27.816
Right now, they don't
even know what I'm in for.

25:27.849 --> 25:30.018
And Lowe can't tell
'em unless I testify.

25:30.051 --> 25:32.687
Having Harris tell my story
is great. Admit it.

25:32.721 --> 25:35.590
It's not a question
of strategy, Ray.

25:35.624 --> 25:37.692
The law says you can't do it.

25:37.726 --> 25:39.260
If it's not true!

25:44.633 --> 25:48.102
And you don't know
if it is or it isn't.

25:54.042 --> 25:56.845
So, no pain,
no loss of appetite?

25:56.878 --> 25:57.946
No. Nothing.

25:57.979 --> 25:58.980
He's had trouble sleeping.

25:59.013 --> 26:00.415
I've been fine.

26:00.449 --> 26:03.051
I know this may not be easy
for you.

26:03.084 --> 26:05.687
Talking it out
can relieve stress.

26:05.720 --> 26:08.390
It can speed
the closure process.

26:09.458 --> 26:10.859
It can help us heal.

26:10.892 --> 26:12.627
Oh, for God's sakes.

26:12.661 --> 26:14.262
Bobby, you agreed to talk
to him, so just--

26:14.296 --> 26:17.332
You know what, ma'am?
It might be better--

26:17.366 --> 26:18.667
Could I speak with
Mr. Donnell alone?

26:18.700 --> 26:19.768
Would that be okay?

26:19.801 --> 26:21.235
Okay.

26:21.269 --> 26:22.504
I'll let the two of you talk.

26:28.477 --> 26:30.044
(door closes)

26:30.078 --> 26:31.980
The people who love us most
want to help,

26:32.013 --> 26:34.048
but their concern can
overwhelm.

26:34.082 --> 26:35.450
Mr....

26:35.484 --> 26:38.420
Wellisch. If you like,
call me Lenny.

26:38.453 --> 26:41.289
Thanks, Lenny.
I got work to do.

26:41.323 --> 26:42.824
Could you get the hell
out of here?

26:44.393 --> 26:46.328
This wasn't your fault.

26:46.895 --> 26:47.796
What?

26:48.297 --> 26:50.732
The man who beat you
was crazy.

26:50.765 --> 26:52.033
You couldn't have prevented it.

26:52.066 --> 26:53.768
You couldn't even see it coming,
could you?

26:55.203 --> 26:55.970
No.

26:56.004 --> 26:57.872
Of course not.
There were no signs.

26:57.906 --> 26:59.308
Do you blame the prison?

26:59.341 --> 27:02.577
Look, I'm not blaming anybody,
and I really am busy here, so...

27:03.812 --> 27:07.382
(sighs) Mr. Donnell, frankly,

27:07.416 --> 27:10.184
my observation is that
you're in good shape.

27:10.218 --> 27:12.621
Let me leave you my card
in case you want to talk more,

27:12.654 --> 27:15.490
and let me just get you
to sign this.

27:15.524 --> 27:16.625
What is it?

27:16.658 --> 27:18.126
Part of the law says
you need to read it.

27:18.159 --> 27:19.794
It says that you've been
contacted by us

27:19.828 --> 27:20.995
and that you're okay.

27:21.029 --> 27:22.431
Wait a second.

27:22.464 --> 27:24.165
This releases the state
from any lawsuits.

27:24.198 --> 27:25.834
W-Well, that's just
one part of the form.

27:25.867 --> 27:27.201
That's why you're here?!

27:27.235 --> 27:29.638
Not to check on me, but to cover
the Commonwealth's ass?!

27:35.510 --> 27:37.111
EUGENE: Easy, Bobby.
What are you doing?

27:38.313 --> 27:39.814
LINDSAY: What is
the matter with you?

27:39.848 --> 27:41.583
He's from the State Attorney
General's office.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.485
He's looking for a release
so I won't sue.

27:43.518 --> 27:45.754
What?
Rebecca, I want cases--

27:45.787 --> 27:47.456
state liability on
failure to protect,

27:47.489 --> 27:49.958
failure to keep from harm,
failure to maintain workspaces.

27:49.991 --> 27:51.259
Bobby, hold on.

27:51.293 --> 27:53.094
They intentionally failed
to protect me.

27:53.127 --> 27:54.796
That's why the state sent him.

27:54.829 --> 27:56.365
They were at least
grossly negligent.

27:56.398 --> 27:58.567
We don't have to file--
They're to blame for this!

28:02.170 --> 28:04.138
The state knows how dangerous
these inmates are.

28:04.172 --> 28:06.174
Where the hell were the guards?!
You need to calm down.

28:06.207 --> 28:09.277
Either help me with this
or leave me alone!

28:14.483 --> 28:15.750
(door closes)

28:22.624 --> 28:24.493
I knew Baumann on the outside.

28:24.526 --> 28:26.160
He was a dealer and a banger.

28:26.194 --> 28:29.531
He dealt in prison, too.
I bought from him.

28:29.564 --> 28:32.166
One time, he shorted me
on a balloon of coke.

28:32.200 --> 28:34.235
That was him
disrespecting me.

28:34.268 --> 28:35.670
He had to pay for that.

28:35.704 --> 28:37.339
Why didn't you kill him
yourself?

28:37.372 --> 28:40.509
It ain't easy getting a guy
who knows you're coming.

28:40.542 --> 28:43.745
He was a big boy.
He got respect for size.

28:43.778 --> 28:46.080
I told you I didn't want
to do it, right?

28:46.114 --> 28:47.816
I didn't give you no choice.

28:49.017 --> 28:51.720
It was you or him.
One of you had to go.

28:51.753 --> 28:55.757
Either way, the word was out.
You punk me, you die.

28:56.925 --> 28:59.928
Thank you.
I don't have anything else.

29:08.970 --> 29:10.839
When did you and the defendant
come up with this story?

29:10.872 --> 29:12.140
It's the truth.

29:12.173 --> 29:14.175
Was it yesterday when
the two of you were bused in

29:14.208 --> 29:16.378
from state prison
for your court proceedings?

29:16.411 --> 29:20.181
I knew Baumann on the outside.
He was a dealer and a banger.

29:20.214 --> 29:25.387
You've been convicted of rape,
robbery, perjury, murder.

29:25.420 --> 29:26.855
Three murders.

29:26.888 --> 29:28.923
And you're about to be sentenced
in another courtroom

29:28.957 --> 29:30.992
for your fourth.
I'm a bad man.

29:31.025 --> 29:32.327
You're a convicted liar,

29:32.361 --> 29:34.729
sentenced to life
with no chance of parole.

29:34.763 --> 29:36.264
Okay.

29:36.298 --> 29:38.633
So when the defendant
asked you to lie for him,

29:38.667 --> 29:40.201
you had nothing to lose.

29:40.234 --> 29:43.071
Another conviction for perjury
or murder, doesn't matter.

29:43.104 --> 29:45.374
Object, argumentative.
He's okay.

29:45.407 --> 29:48.410
What are you talking about?
You lie for him,
there's no downside.

29:48.443 --> 29:49.711
There's an upside.

29:49.744 --> 29:50.745
What's that?

29:50.779 --> 29:53.147
He owes you.
He's an ally.

29:53.181 --> 29:54.649
That's key in prison,

29:54.683 --> 29:57.352
especially for a guy with
as many enemies as you've got.

29:58.487 --> 30:00.455
I got no idea what you mean.

30:04.092 --> 30:05.994
I move to strike
his whole testimony

30:06.027 --> 30:07.729
as blatantly unreliable.

30:07.762 --> 30:08.897
That's a jury call.

30:08.930 --> 30:10.599
Then I move to preclude
the jury

30:10.632 --> 30:12.501
from being instructed
on the necessity defense.

30:13.302 --> 30:15.136
Miss Frutt, your response?

30:15.804 --> 30:17.806
My response?
I thought I couldn't--

30:17.839 --> 30:19.441
Standby counsel may argue

30:19.474 --> 30:20.809
outside the presence
of the jury--

30:20.842 --> 30:22.877
I am ordering you
to do so now.

30:31.520 --> 30:33.388
Black letter law.

30:33.422 --> 30:36.391
He can't be convicted if he
killed out of necessity.

30:36.425 --> 30:38.760
Mr. Harris said he
told my client,

30:38.793 --> 30:40.895
"Kill Baumann or be killed."

30:40.929 --> 30:42.897
Necessity is a defense
to murder

30:42.931 --> 30:44.433
in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts.

30:44.466 --> 30:47.469
But to raise it, the danger
of death has to be immediate.

30:47.502 --> 30:49.471
Baumann was asleep.

30:49.504 --> 30:52.073
Harris wasn't even housed
in the same cellblock.

30:52.106 --> 30:54.142
The Supreme Court says
prisoners may raise it--

30:54.175 --> 30:55.977
ALAN: Oh, come on, Ellenor.
You yourself admitted

30:56.010 --> 30:58.380
the man has no defense.
It's a lie.

30:58.413 --> 30:59.881
As the court has repeatedly
pointed out,

30:59.914 --> 31:01.950
this is my client's defense,
not mine.

31:01.983 --> 31:04.252
That's no excuse.
You're helping him
to obstruct justice.

31:04.285 --> 31:07.322
I am doing exactly as I was
directed by the court.

31:07.356 --> 31:09.691
The man didn't even testify
he acted out of necessity.

31:09.724 --> 31:10.825
He doesn't need to testify.

31:10.859 --> 31:13.495
The witness established
a factual basis.

31:15.029 --> 31:18.199
Mr. Lowe, I understand
you're unhappy,

31:18.232 --> 31:20.402
but I cannot strike down
the man's defense.

31:20.435 --> 31:22.571
Why not just tell the jury
to acquit?

31:23.738 --> 31:25.707
You know what?

31:25.740 --> 31:27.709
Mr. McMurphy manages
to conduct himself

31:27.742 --> 31:30.645
with more professionalism
and show this court more respect

31:30.679 --> 31:32.280
than you appear capable of.

31:32.314 --> 31:33.982
You might follow his example.

31:37.719 --> 31:40.855
We'll bring down the jury and
proceed to closing arguments.

31:51.366 --> 31:54.869
Two men were locked
in an eight-by-ten-foot cell.

31:54.903 --> 31:58.507
The defendant waited
for the victim to fall asleep,

31:58.540 --> 32:00.108
then he stood up,

32:00.141 --> 32:05.880
and stabbed the sleeping man
over and over and over again

32:05.914 --> 32:07.382
until he died.

32:07.416 --> 32:09.150
His prints were on the weapon.

32:10.218 --> 32:12.954
He confessed to the crime.

32:12.987 --> 32:14.823
The defense story--

32:14.856 --> 32:16.691
the one that he cooked up
with his friend--

32:16.725 --> 32:18.226
is a lie.

32:18.259 --> 32:19.994
If it were true,

32:20.028 --> 32:21.863
why didn't he tell
the deputy warden about it

32:21.896 --> 32:24.132
on the day he confessed?

32:24.165 --> 32:25.900
He never said anything
at that time

32:25.934 --> 32:28.603
about his life being threatened.

32:28.637 --> 32:32.273
The defendant is suddenly
hatching this necessity defense

32:32.307 --> 32:34.509
because he has nothing else.

32:35.310 --> 32:36.945
He's desperate.

32:38.146 --> 32:40.782
Blood, prints,

32:40.815 --> 32:43.585
motive, confession.

32:45.019 --> 32:46.888
He's desperate.

32:50.959 --> 32:53.428
Being in court and having you
people listen to me

32:53.462 --> 32:56.230
has been one of the best
things in my life.

32:56.264 --> 32:57.866
That sounds weird, right?

32:58.967 --> 33:00.469
I'm on trial for murder.

33:01.870 --> 33:05.440
But in my life,
nobody ever listened to me.

33:07.141 --> 33:09.611
I'm not smart like Mr. Lowe.

33:09.644 --> 33:10.945
I wasn't good at school.

33:12.647 --> 33:15.850
I made a lot
of stupid decisions,

33:15.884 --> 33:19.354
and I paid for every one
of them.

33:20.389 --> 33:21.923
Being in prison

33:21.956 --> 33:24.526
is the worst thing
in the world.

33:25.760 --> 33:27.696
Unless you've been there,
you don't know.

33:28.830 --> 33:33.468
You lock men up,
they become animals.

33:33.502 --> 33:36.137
I seen guys do things
to each other,

33:36.170 --> 33:39.474
kill each other for nothing.

33:39.508 --> 33:43.211
When Harris told me,
"Kill Baumann or be killed,"

33:43.244 --> 33:45.514
I knew it was real.

33:47.316 --> 33:51.152
I could see myself
lying in the shower
or in the exercise yard,

33:51.185 --> 33:53.054
blood coming out of me.

33:53.087 --> 33:55.557
I knew it was me or Baumann.

33:56.891 --> 33:58.993
Why didn't I tell all this to
the warden before?

33:59.027 --> 34:01.630
Because I was still in prison,

34:01.663 --> 34:03.898
and I still
could have been killed.

34:05.700 --> 34:11.239
I am sorry for killing
Mr. Baumann.

34:11.272 --> 34:12.641
I had to do it.

34:13.308 --> 34:15.109
I had no choice.

34:15.976 --> 34:18.279
If I hadn't killed Mr. Baumann,

34:18.313 --> 34:20.849
that man, Harris...

34:22.083 --> 34:23.585
...would've killed me.

34:24.652 --> 34:27.389
Mr. Lowe calls me desperate.

34:29.958 --> 34:30.958
I am.

34:33.027 --> 34:34.496
Desperate now...

34:35.964 --> 34:38.500
...like I was desperate then.

34:47.442 --> 34:49.177
Here are the cases you wanted.

34:49.210 --> 34:50.244
Thanks.

34:53.482 --> 34:55.116
She cares about you, Bobby.

34:56.851 --> 34:58.853
She's worried about you.
We all are.

35:00.154 --> 35:01.990
We don't know what
to do to help you.

35:05.159 --> 35:06.995
Thanks for the cases.

35:08.196 --> 35:09.964
Bobby, you attacked a man,

35:09.998 --> 35:11.833
physically threw him
out of the office.

35:14.936 --> 35:17.872
You're always there to help
everybody in the firm.

35:19.708 --> 35:22.844
But for you, Bobby,
you're selfish.

35:26.948 --> 35:29.384
It's selfish to never
let us help you.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.403
Now you're wearing it.

35:48.437 --> 35:50.004
The trial's over.

35:50.038 --> 35:52.040
Nothing left but the verdict,
so I figured why not.

35:52.807 --> 35:54.108
What'd you do to your hair?

35:54.142 --> 35:56.110
I gave myself a little trim.

35:56.144 --> 35:58.780
Figured if I'm gonna look good,
I should look good.

36:00.415 --> 36:01.983
How'd you get the haircut?

36:02.651 --> 36:03.752
Judge's chambers.

36:04.486 --> 36:05.954
Scissors.

36:05.987 --> 36:09.424
Old habit-- you see a potential
weapon, you just grab it.

36:14.696 --> 36:17.098
You seem depressed.

36:17.131 --> 36:18.032
What's wrong?

36:19.668 --> 36:21.269
I wasn't kidding

36:21.303 --> 36:22.504
when I said that trial

36:22.537 --> 36:26.107
was the best thing
in my life, Ellenor.

36:26.140 --> 36:28.009
I felt like a citizen
in there.

36:29.711 --> 36:30.845
And now it's over?

36:31.980 --> 36:33.348
Now it's over.

36:36.050 --> 36:38.487
Baumann was real popular.

36:38.520 --> 36:40.755
If I go back to prison,
I will be killed.

36:42.223 --> 36:45.093
That's why I was so desperate
to have the trial now,

36:45.126 --> 36:46.728
even if I had to
represent myself.

36:48.029 --> 36:49.531
A court holding cell,
I survive.

36:49.564 --> 36:50.699
Prison, I don't.

36:51.933 --> 36:53.368
Well, I could try to get you

36:53.402 --> 36:54.469
into protective custody.

36:54.503 --> 36:56.538
No. I am not
going back.

36:57.939 --> 37:00.342
Ray, even if you win here,

37:00.375 --> 37:03.111
you still have the remaining
sentence on the robbery.

37:03.144 --> 37:06.180
Ellenor, I am not going back.

37:16.325 --> 37:17.459
Where's the guard?

37:22.564 --> 37:25.600
Oh, my God!
Ray!

37:28.370 --> 37:30.772
Judge Mantz should be careful
about his scissors.

37:33.842 --> 37:35.910
Ellenor, I have
the guard's gun.

37:37.111 --> 37:40.114
If you make a noise,
I will have to kill you.

37:41.950 --> 37:44.786
You will never
get out of here.

37:44.819 --> 37:47.589
Court security faces
the entrances, not the exits.

37:47.622 --> 37:49.758
They don't check guys
as they're leaving...

37:52.294 --> 37:54.663
Especially not guys
looking like this.

38:17.652 --> 38:19.253
(elevator dings)

38:44.679 --> 38:47.449
(sniffs, exhales)
It's been a long time.

38:53.322 --> 38:54.956
Thanks for walking me out,
Ellenor.

38:55.990 --> 38:57.359
Not that you had a choice.

39:02.997 --> 39:05.667
Ask the jury what they
thought of my closing.

39:05.700 --> 39:07.569
Maybe they have some
suggestions for next time.

39:09.638 --> 39:12.941
(engine turns over)

39:25.420 --> 39:26.688
What?

39:30.091 --> 39:31.293
Oh, my God.

39:39.233 --> 39:43.237
Uh, despite the absence
of the defendant,

39:43.271 --> 39:47.376
the law requires taking
the verdict in open court.

39:49.478 --> 39:52.146
Mr. Foreman, to the charge
of murder in the first degree,

39:52.180 --> 39:53.515
how say you?

39:55.884 --> 40:00.589
Your Honor, we find
the defendant, Raymond McMurphy,

40:00.622 --> 40:02.256
not guilty.

40:04.393 --> 40:06.395
To the charge of murder
in the second degree,

40:07.195 --> 40:09.331
we find the defendant,
Raymond McMurphy...

40:10.965 --> 40:12.033
...not guilty.

40:17.606 --> 40:18.973
MANTZ: It is my practice--

40:20.008 --> 40:21.810
I usually thank the jury

40:21.843 --> 40:24.779
for its service
on behalf of the parties...

40:27.148 --> 40:27.916
the defendant...

40:30.452 --> 40:32.421
but at this point...

40:34.756 --> 40:36.358
I think we're done.

40:36.391 --> 40:37.459
(gavel bangs)

40:51.172 --> 40:53.508
...considered armed,
extremely dangerous,

40:53.542 --> 40:55.310
and obviously resourceful.

40:55.344 --> 40:57.011
Meanwhile, questions remain

40:57.045 --> 40:59.714
as to how a prisoner could so
easily escape detection,

40:59.748 --> 41:02.617
especially since security has
recently been heightened.

41:04.152 --> 41:07.889
Incredible. The man
actually walked out.

41:08.957 --> 41:10.024
(sighs)

41:11.793 --> 41:13.728
Listen, if you want,

41:13.762 --> 41:16.197
I'll help you draft that
complaint for the lawsuit.

41:18.266 --> 41:19.167
Thanks.

41:19.200 --> 41:20.702
I did some research,

41:20.735 --> 41:22.170
and the law's not bad for us.

41:22.203 --> 41:23.505
And a lawsuit could make them

41:23.538 --> 41:26.375
provide more protection
for other lawyers.

41:26.408 --> 41:27.609
Nobody should--

41:27.642 --> 41:29.678
There isn't going to be
any lawsuit.

41:31.980 --> 41:33.181
Not now anyway.

41:34.983 --> 41:36.250
Oh.

41:36.284 --> 41:39.721
I can always file one later...
or not.

41:39.754 --> 41:42.123
The statute of limitations
doesn't run out for a year.

41:42.824 --> 41:43.925
Okay.

41:50.499 --> 41:52.467
I don't know if I can do
this anymore.

41:53.402 --> 41:55.937
Bobby...
Lindsay, that day in the cell

41:55.970 --> 41:58.973
right before
I passed out, I knew,

41:59.007 --> 42:02.243
without a shadow of doubt,
that I was gonna die.

42:05.747 --> 42:07.749
And I would never see
our son again...

42:11.285 --> 42:13.388
...that I would never
see you again.

42:19.661 --> 42:23.432
I can't stop being
a lawyer, Lindsay.

42:30.605 --> 42:32.106
But I'm scared.

42:34.142 --> 42:36.044
And I don't know
what to do about that.

42:41.350 --> 42:42.417
I do.

43:02.036 --> 43:03.938
BOBBY: Next, on The Practice:

43:03.972 --> 43:08.109
It was long before
I became the "esteemed
Chief Judge Fleming,"

43:08.142 --> 43:12.080
winner of the State Bar
Association's Lifetime
Acievement Award.

43:12.113 --> 43:14.549
We have reason to believe
His Honor has been
accepting bribes.

43:14.583 --> 43:16.985
Have you approached any
of the attorneys in those cases,

43:17.018 --> 43:18.387
spoken with anyone upstairs?

43:18.420 --> 43:21.456
We prefer, in these matters,
to handle this through a sting.

43:21.490 --> 43:23.925
We create a case, and then
we assign it to an attorney

43:23.958 --> 43:25.460
who we think might be involved.

43:25.494 --> 43:27.195
You think I'm somehow
in on this?

43:27.228 --> 43:29.464
You have a very
impressive track record

43:29.498 --> 43:30.699
in front
of Judge Fleming.

43:30.732 --> 43:32.200
Get out of my office!

43:34.403 --> 43:36.505
(music playing)

44:00.795 --> 44:01.796
You stinker!
