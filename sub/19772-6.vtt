 Previously, on Andi Mack...

00:06.210 --> 00:07.710
Do you know
who my dad is?

00:07.710 --> 00:08.750
Yes, but I--

00:08.750 --> 00:11.290
Who is he?
Where is he?

00:11.290 --> 00:12.750
His daughter wants
to know him.

00:12.750 --> 00:14.420
I don't want to write him!

 This is his email.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.460
-Do I know you?
-Buffy.

Marty.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.750
Andi: Why is it so hard
to stop liking someone

00:23.750 --> 00:27.380
when there's a zero percent chance
they'll ever like you back?

00:37.210 --> 00:39.670
I've already decided...

00:39.670 --> 00:41.290
I'm not telling him.

00:43.620 --> 00:45.330
Except you have to.

00:45.330 --> 00:47.920
Buffy, I'm not asking
for your advice.

00:47.920 --> 00:50.040
I'm just reporting
what I saw.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.670
Which... was what exactly?

00:51.670 --> 00:54.420
Amber drawing a heart
on a guy's hand.

00:54.420 --> 00:57.080
Somebody who wasn't Jonah.

00:58.420 --> 01:01.250
How could anyone
treat him like that?

01:01.250 --> 01:02.920
(laughs)

01:04.459 --> 01:09.120
Well, guess what? She gets to
go on treating him like that...

01:09.120 --> 01:10.920
unless you tell him.

01:12.420 --> 01:13.670
He'll hate me.

01:13.670 --> 01:15.460
He won't hate you.

01:15.460 --> 01:18.710
He probably won't smile and
wave when he sees you, though.

01:18.710 --> 01:20.380
He won't?

01:20.380 --> 01:21.460
-Hey, Cyrus.
-Mm-hm?

01:21.460 --> 01:22.960
-Someone wants you over there.
-Who?

01:22.960 --> 01:24.790
Me.

01:24.790 --> 01:26.380
What if I put a note
in his locker?

01:26.380 --> 01:28.580
That's what a coward
would do,

01:28.580 --> 01:30.040
and you're not a coward.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.460
Yes, I am!

You've seen me
at the water park.

speaks indiscernibly)

You didn't need

Well, I live here

No, you didn't.

03:15.420 --> 03:17.580
Thank you.

-You're wel--
-You got the wrong muesli.

03:21.830 --> 03:23.120
I'll return it.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.330
Not bad.

03:45.330 --> 03:47.080
Not bad as in...

03:47.080 --> 03:48.460
As in pretty good.

03:48.460 --> 03:50.000
What was my time?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.960
Do I know you?

03:51.960 --> 03:55.170
You would know if you knew me.

03:55.170 --> 03:56.670
Hold on.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.920
You're that guy...

04:00.920 --> 04:03.290
who lied
about eating a frog.

04:03.290 --> 04:05.250
I'd rather
you remembered my name.

04:05.250 --> 04:06.290
I don't.

04:06.290 --> 04:08.380
Marty...
from the party.

04:08.380 --> 04:09.710
Right.

04:09.710 --> 04:11.330
The one who liked to sass chat.

04:11.330 --> 04:13.620
I prefer to think of it
as banter.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.329
(sighs) Can I please
just have my time?

04:16.329 --> 04:21.120
Sure. All right, let's see,
that was... 11.8.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.790
And what's the fastest?

04:22.790 --> 04:24.040
11.8.

04:24.040 --> 04:27.210
Wait. Are you saying
I'm the fastest?

04:27.210 --> 04:30.880
-Yeah. -My first time out,
and I'm already the fastest!

04:30.880 --> 04:32.460
Girl.

04:32.460 --> 04:34.420
What?

04:34.420 --> 04:35.830
You're the fastest girl.

04:35.830 --> 04:38.120
Meaning what?
There's a faster boy?

04:38.120 --> 04:39.380
-Yup.
-Who?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.750
Hi, Marty from the party,
nice to meet you.

04:41.750 --> 04:45.330
You? I thought you were just
the guy with the stopwatch.

04:45.330 --> 04:47.250
I am the guy
with the stopwatch

04:47.250 --> 04:49.500
helping out Coach Rez,
who asked me to time you.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.170
And what's your time?

04:51.170 --> 04:52.330
11.5.

04:52.330 --> 04:53.830
I can beat that.

04:53.830 --> 04:55.580
Don't be so sure.

04:55.580 --> 04:56.790
But I am.

04:56.790 --> 04:59.330
Minor biological reality:
When it comes to racing,

04:59.330 --> 05:02.000
males and females
were not created equal.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.420
The fastest woman will never
beat the fastest man.

05:04.420 --> 05:06.250
-Even if that's true--
-It's true.

05:06.250 --> 05:08.330
It doesn't mean
that I can't beat you.

05:08.330 --> 05:10.920
Well, I welcome
the challenge...

05:10.920 --> 05:12.620
hopeless though it may be.

05:12.620 --> 05:14.750
At least now I know
you'll remember who I am.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.380
Yes, I will.

05:16.380 --> 05:19.250
You're 11.5.

05:21.420 --> 05:22.710
(sighs)

05:22.710 --> 05:25.330
(people chattering)

05:40.040 --> 05:41.460
Vas happenin?
(chuckles)

05:41.460 --> 05:43.170
Huh?

05:43.170 --> 05:44.670
You wanted
to tell me something?

05:44.670 --> 05:47.580
No. I don't!
Who said that, Buffy?

05:47.580 --> 05:51.290
(laughs) You were just looking
at me, like-- what is it?

05:51.290 --> 05:54.170
Jonah, I can't.
You'll hate me.

05:54.170 --> 05:56.960
(scoffs) Hate you?
That's impossible.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.670
I saw Amber in the park
with someone else.

06:02.670 --> 06:04.460
Yeah?

06:04.460 --> 06:06.380
A guy.

06:06.380 --> 06:07.750
Who?

06:07.750 --> 06:11.290
I don't know... but she
was drawing on his hand.

06:11.290 --> 06:12.880
She was?

06:12.880 --> 06:17.540
And I'm not a hundred percent
sure, but I think it was a heart.

06:19.330 --> 06:20.420
Like this?

06:21.420 --> 06:23.580
Yeah.

06:23.580 --> 06:25.540
Except yours
is nicer.

06:27.380 --> 06:29.460
I-- I wasn't
gonna tell you, and--

06:29.460 --> 06:32.080
I'm-- I'm gonna try and
wash this off before class.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.750
Yeah. Yeah,
of-- of course.

06:34.750 --> 06:36.380
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

06:36.380 --> 06:38.960
Obviously, I mean,
you're Jonah Beck.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.540
I'll be fine. Don't worry.

06:40.540 --> 06:43.290
Yeah... you just said that.

06:43.290 --> 06:44.420
I did?

06:44.420 --> 06:45.710
Yeah.

07:00.830 --> 07:03.210
You told him?

07:03.210 --> 07:05.500
I'm proud of you.
It was the right thing to do.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.830
No, it wasn't.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.420
Did you see him?

07:09.420 --> 07:10.790
He's human.

07:11.830 --> 07:14.330
I didn't need to know
Jonah Beck was human.

07:15.880 --> 07:16.880
(door closes)

07:18.920 --> 07:20.000
(sighs)

07:24.420 --> 07:25.290
Ugh...

07:25.290 --> 07:28.170
(heavy rumbling sound)

07:35.420 --> 07:36.790
What's going on?

07:36.790 --> 07:39.580
I'm just making this place
a little easier to navigate.

07:40.670 --> 07:42.420
No! Careful!

07:42.420 --> 07:45.000
Mom! I'm not a child anymore!

07:45.000 --> 07:48.120
What do you think I'm gonna do,
spill apple juice on something?

07:48.120 --> 07:49.540
-Oh!
-Oh, shoot!

07:49.540 --> 07:50.710
Oh no.

07:52.290 --> 07:55.080
It's fine, it still works.

just grow up already!

08:05.120 --> 08:06.540

08:06.540 --> 08:08.040
This is it!

08:08.040 --> 08:10.790
I'm here!
And I'm raising my daughter.

08:10.790 --> 08:14.290
I have a job, that I like,
that I'm actually good at.

08:14.290 --> 08:19.460

you tell me you're proud of me.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.420
Amber, stop.
You made your point.

Wait. You sent me that text?

09:49.380 --> 09:50.250
I had to.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.460
I had to show Jonah
why you were lying

09:53.460 --> 09:55.960
about seeing me with some
other boy at the park.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.750
I didn't lie.

09:57.750 --> 10:01.040
Why would I lie about seeing
you with another guy?

10:01.040 --> 10:02.420
Because you like Jonah!

10:03.420 --> 10:06.880

Girl Who Doesn't Lie.

10:09.330 --> 10:10.710
Amber, come on.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.290
Jonah, this is important.

10:12.290 --> 10:14.670
If she's so honest,
she can be honest about this.

10:16.120 --> 10:18.250
It's not that complicated.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.960
Do you like him?

10:19.960 --> 10:22.250
And I don't mean
as just a friend.

10:22.250 --> 10:23.960
Or a teammate.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.380
You know, the question
I'd rather answer is,

10:29.380 --> 10:33.830
why am I still standing

10:35.540 --> 10:38.920
And the answer is...
I'm not.

11:33.750 --> 11:36.000
You literally
have a one-track mind.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.670
Is that a yes or a no?

11:37.670 --> 11:38.750
You wanna race me?

11:40.170 --> 11:42.880
Sure. Name the place,
name the time.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.500
Right here, right now.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.710
-Now?
-Now!

11:45.710 --> 11:47.250
-You're cra--
-Go!

11:47.250 --> 11:48.920

11:51.330 --> 11:54.250

12:01.500 --> 12:02.380
That wasn't fair.

12:02.380 --> 12:05.040
Sorry. We can try it
another time...

12:05.040 --> 12:06.290
when you're ready.

12:06.290 --> 12:09.080
Oh, I'll be ready.
Just say the word.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.750
-Go!
-Hey, stop doing that!

12:25.460 --> 12:27.250
Hey.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.210
How'd you find me?

12:29.210 --> 12:31.460
Y-- Your bike's still here,
so I've been looking.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.420
I just wanted to see
you were okay.

12:38.420 --> 12:39.880
Are you?

12:39.880 --> 12:42.880
Yes. This is where I go

12:42.880 --> 12:46.330
and this is what I look like
when things are okay.

12:50.210 --> 12:51.500
About what happened...

12:53.330 --> 12:57.380
the thing is...
Amber's kind of... insecure.

12:57.380 --> 13:01.330
That's like saying
sharks are insecure.

13:01.330 --> 13:04.250
"Oh, I wonder
if that dolphin likes me.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.210
Never mind,
I'm just gonna eat it."

13:07.210 --> 13:09.040
Andi, I-- I feel really bad.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.210
Do you really believe her?

13:11.210 --> 13:13.330
Your insecure shark?

13:13.330 --> 13:16.330
Do you really think
that I lied to you?

13:16.330 --> 13:18.790
No. I don't know.

13:18.790 --> 13:20.880
Maybe you didn't see
what you thought you saw.

13:22.790 --> 13:24.120
You know what?

13:24.120 --> 13:26.710
You're a really great
boyfriend...

13:26.710 --> 13:28.670
but not such a great friend.

13:29.830 --> 13:31.250
At least to me.

13:32.330 --> 13:33.920
I'm sorry.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.000
Yeah, me too...

13:36.460 --> 13:39.830
that I ever
said anything to you.

13:39.830 --> 13:41.080
Andi.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.540
Please just go.

13:45.620 --> 13:47.120
Just go.

13:48.750 --> 13:51.880
♪ ♪

14:00.290 --> 14:01.580
Buffy:
This is all my fault.

14:01.580 --> 14:04.040
I shoulda never made you
tell Jonah.

14:04.040 --> 14:08.330
Buffy, you've gotta stop saying
everything so confidently.

14:08.330 --> 14:10.170
You made us think you know
what you're talking about.

14:10.170 --> 14:12.210
Most of the time
I do what I'm talking about.

14:13.920 --> 14:17.000
Just... this time I didn't.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.080
I'm sorry.

14:22.750 --> 14:23.920
She's sorry.

14:27.750 --> 14:29.380
This isn't the end
of the world.

14:29.380 --> 14:31.120
I wish it was!

14:31.120 --> 14:36.000
My only other options
are moving or... dying.

14:37.830 --> 14:41.170
Okay, let's take this
step by step.

14:41.170 --> 14:43.290
Obviously,
you're not going to school...

14:43.290 --> 14:44.460
Ever again!

14:44.460 --> 14:46.290
Well, we'll start
with tomorrow.

14:46.290 --> 14:48.290
You're taking a sick day.

14:48.290 --> 14:49.960
All you need
are a few symptoms.

14:49.960 --> 14:53.000
Retrieve that computer
and fire up the Internet.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.040
We're goin' in.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.420
Great job, Bex,
it looks fantastic!

15:03.420 --> 15:05.290
I just wanna make
a few little tweaks.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.080
Bex?

15:09.080 --> 15:10.120
Uh-- Oh!

15:10.120 --> 15:11.290
Bex!

15:11.290 --> 15:13.000
I got it! I'll fix it!

15:13.000 --> 15:14.210
Oh...

15:14.210 --> 15:16.830
I'm so sorry.
She's new.

15:16.830 --> 15:18.330
Brittany?

15:18.330 --> 15:20.040
Yeah?

15:20.040 --> 15:22.830
Brittany,
you remember my mom?

15:22.830 --> 15:25.670
Oh! Yes! Of course!

15:25.670 --> 15:27.040
Hi, Mrs. Mack.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.080
How are you?

15:28.080 --> 15:30.210
Did you ever get that
stain out of your rug?

15:30.210 --> 15:32.920
No... it's right where you
dropped your jelly toast

15:32.920 --> 15:35.290
because you refused
to use a plate.

15:35.290 --> 15:37.040
Hmm.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.420
I have stuff I need to do
in the back.

15:39.710 --> 15:41.710
Nice seeing you again,
Mrs. Mack.

15:42.710 --> 15:44.000
Not.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.710
She was a little monster.

15:48.710 --> 15:51.380
What cruel twist of fate
brought you two back together?

15:51.380 --> 15:53.380
She hired me.

15:53.380 --> 15:54.710
I'm sorry?

15:54.710 --> 15:56.170
She's my boss.

15:56.170 --> 15:59.460
I now work for the heinous
child I used to babysit.

15:59.460 --> 16:02.460
Yeah.
It's your worst nightmare.

16:02.460 --> 16:05.750
I'm an embarrassment.
I'll never amount to anything.

16:05.750 --> 16:08.500
Go ahead, Mom.
Have at it.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.880
Your father and I have tickets
to see Wicked tonight.

16:13.170 --> 16:15.330
You seem to be
good at, you know...

16:17.330 --> 16:20.250
You want me
to do your makeup?

16:20.250 --> 16:21.960
I was going for this.

16:23.420 --> 16:28.170
Right. You do realize I use a makeup
brush and not a time machine?

16:28.170 --> 16:29.330
Good one.

16:33.290 --> 16:35.460
So, give me a fake cough.

16:36.710 --> 16:37.750
(coughs)

16:37.750 --> 16:39.290
Now try a fake sneeze.

16:40.380 --> 16:42.420
Ha-choo!

16:42.420 --> 16:45.250
Okay. Now give me
some chills.

16:47.670 --> 16:50.710
Now land the plane.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.330
(coughs)

16:52.330 --> 16:53.920
Ha-choo!

16:56.540 --> 16:58.170
What do you think?

16:58.170 --> 17:02.920
I like it...
but I don't love it.

17:06.290 --> 17:09.579
Ooh! You are good at this.

17:09.579 --> 17:10.790
Thanks, Mom.

17:12.750 --> 17:17.170
Okay, now I gotta run, so I can buy a new
keyboard to replace the one you ruined.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.920
I'm gonna pretend like you left
after "You're good at this."

17:19.920 --> 17:21.210
Okay.

17:21.210 --> 17:24.880
(hair dryer humming)

17:24.880 --> 17:26.960
Andi:
Aaah! Please stop!

17:26.960 --> 17:28.540
Andi!

17:28.540 --> 17:32.170
Andi: Aaah! Stop! It's hot!
It's hot!

17:32.170 --> 17:33.620
Aah! It's hot!

17:33.620 --> 17:34.750
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

17:34.750 --> 17:37.420
(hair dryer stops)

17:37.420 --> 17:40.670
What... is going on?

17:40.670 --> 17:42.420
Guys?

17:42.420 --> 17:43.830
I got nothin'.

17:43.830 --> 17:44.920
Science homework?

17:47.580 --> 17:51.330
I can't go to school tomorrow.
Please don't ask me why.

17:51.330 --> 17:53.380
Go on.

17:53.380 --> 17:56.830
So, I need to be sick, which I'm
not, but we're working on it,

17:56.830 --> 17:58.920
and it's... really painful.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.290
Because you're doing it wrong.

18:02.420 --> 18:05.290
All you need is a little eye
shadow to make some dark circles,

18:05.290 --> 18:07.500
a heating pad, ideally two,
to raise your temperature,

18:07.500 --> 18:09.880
and some chunky chicken soup
to pass for vomit.

18:11.250 --> 18:14.540
Or... I could
write you a note.

18:14.540 --> 18:17.330
-Oh, dang.
-Just like that?

18:17.330 --> 18:20.120
I don't even have
to tell you why?

18:20.120 --> 18:23.620
I know I'm not perfect,
but I'm good for some things.

18:39.790 --> 18:42.080
Hey. Why aren't you
dressed for school?

18:42.080 --> 18:44.540
She's not going. She's
taking a mental health day.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.620
That's absurd.
There's no such thing.

18:46.620 --> 18:48.960
Get ready,
you're going to school.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.750
Mom, it's one day.

18:50.750 --> 18:52.120
Stop trying
to be her friend.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.170
Be her mother.

18:53.170 --> 18:54.620
I can't.
I can't go.

18:54.620 --> 18:56.420
-Why not?
-(doorbell ringing)

18:56.420 --> 18:58.290
Oh, go see who it is.

18:58.290 --> 19:00.330
-Why not?
-Um...

19:00.330 --> 19:03.080
Man:
Bex!

19:03.080 --> 19:04.380
Bowie?

19:06.380 --> 19:07.620
Who?

19:07.620 --> 19:09.330
Oh, hey, Mrs. Mack.

19:09.330 --> 19:11.920
(yelps)
What's he doing here?

19:11.920 --> 19:14.540
-What are you doing here?
-Well, I got your email.

19:14.540 --> 19:16.500
Email? Email?

19:18.500 --> 19:19.750
Hi, there.

19:21.330 --> 19:22.420
Hi.

19:22.420 --> 19:25.330
I just wrote "Hey."
Literally one word.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.540
I'm Bowie.

19:27.540 --> 19:28.960
Andi.

19:31.580 --> 19:32.670
Mom...

19:34.290 --> 19:35.920
I have to.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.380
You do?

19:39.540 --> 19:40.750
Andi...

19:43.330 --> 19:44.750
this is your dad.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.420
Bowie.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.580
Bowie.

19:54.290 --> 19:56.170
This is your daughter.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.960
Andi and Bowie:
Whoa.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.210
(both laugh)

20:03.580 --> 20:06.420
Ham!
We have a problem!

20:07.880 --> 20:09.420
I see she hasn't changed.

20:09.420 --> 20:11.120
No, she has not.

20:13.710 --> 20:15.540
But everything else has.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.040
Next, on Andi Mack...

20:23.040 --> 20:24.710
-We have news.
-So do I.

20:24.710 --> 20:27.460
-Our is bigger.
-That's literally impossible.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.210
Both: Jonah and Amber
broke up!

20:30.210 --> 20:31.500
For real!

20:31.500 --> 20:33.380
He could be with anyone
he wanted!

20:33.380 --> 20:34.290
But what if it's me?

20:34.290 --> 20:36.210
Jonah: I need to talk to you.

20:36.210 --> 20:37.670
-Andi--
-Bowie: Andi!

20:37.670 --> 20:38.750
Jonah: Who's that?

20:38.750 --> 20:40.540
It doesn't matter.
What were you gonna say?

20:40.540 --> 20:42.080
I'll tell you later.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.460
-Okay.
-Here she is!

20:43.460 --> 20:46.250
We're gonna have the best
 father-daughter date ever.

20:46.250 --> 20:48.040
-Are you stoked?
-You bet!
