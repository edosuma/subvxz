00:40.900 --> 00:46.767
(mellow music playing)

01:07.166 --> 01:10.400
-Oh, morning, Ma. How'd you sleep?
-Pretty good.

01:10.467 --> 01:12.767
I dreamed I was making love to Jay Leno.

01:19.300 --> 01:22.100
That's a strange dream for you to have.

01:22.166 --> 01:25.834
Not really. It was Monday night.
He was filling in for Carson.

01:28.600 --> 01:32.033
-Morning, all.
-Blanche, how was your date last night?

01:32.100 --> 01:33.700
Unforgettable.

01:34.100 --> 01:38.166
Mel Bushman and I were coming back
from a champagne picnic at sunset beach

01:38.233 --> 01:40.800
and ran out of gas.

01:40.867 --> 01:43.300
-What did you do?
-You name it.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.734
Blanche, you got a call last night

01:48.800 --> 01:51.600
from something called
the Maltese Falcon Club.

01:51.667 --> 01:53.066
Oh, good.

01:53.133 --> 01:57.266
I was asked to select the activity
for the museum staff's annual outing.

01:57.633 --> 02:02.066
I signed up for a murder mystery weekend
at the queen of the keys hotel.

02:02.133 --> 02:07.300
The thing where mock murders are committed
and the guests solve them?

02:07.367 --> 02:09.667
-Exactly.
-Sounds like fun.

02:10.166 --> 02:14.400
Back in Minnesota,
I was the Sherlock Holmes of St. Olaf.

02:15.266 --> 02:18.467
Figured out which one was shinola,
did you, Rose?

02:20.333 --> 02:21.433
The hard way.

02:23.567 --> 02:25.900
I sure hope this weekend is a success.

02:26.233 --> 02:29.834
Could be my shot at becoming
Kendall Nesbitt's new assistant.

02:29.900 --> 02:33.700
-Who's Kendall Nesbitt?
-The museum's director of acquisitions.

02:33.767 --> 02:37.133
Getting this job means going to Europe
with him

02:37.200 --> 02:39.467
to look for rare paintings and antiques.

02:39.533 --> 02:42.133
Well, if he has an eye for antiques,
you're a shoo-in.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.367
Look who's calling the vase Ming.

02:49.433 --> 02:51.000
There's just one hitch--

02:51.066 --> 02:54.467
I need three more people
for the group rate.

02:54.533 --> 02:56.667
I thought hotels always gave you
the group rate.

02:59.934 --> 03:02.433
Yeah, but this is for the whole night.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.367
Could I persuade you girls to join me
for a murder mystery weekend?

03:10.433 --> 03:12.500
Blanche, are you kidding?

03:12.567 --> 03:14.133
I have read every word

03:14.200 --> 03:17.200
Dashiell Hammett and
Raymond chandler ever wrote.

03:17.266 --> 03:20.700
Sam spade and Philip Marlowe
have become a part of me.

03:21.700 --> 03:24.834
"She had more curves than
the Monaco Grand Prix

03:24.900 --> 03:26.767
and was twice as dangerous.

03:27.533 --> 03:29.500
Her jewelry was mute testimony

03:29.567 --> 03:34.033
that Charlie Chaplin wasn't the only
tramp who hit it big in this town."

03:36.100 --> 03:38.600
You do this on first dates,
don't you, Dorothy?

03:41.700 --> 03:44.500
-Does this mean you'll go?
-Of course we'll go.

03:44.567 --> 03:46.700
Sure. Anything for a friend.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.433
-Heck, I'll go, too.
-Like you had a choice.

03:53.200 --> 03:57.934
(serene music playing)

03:59.800 --> 04:02.066
When do you think
the mysteries are gonna start?

04:02.133 --> 04:05.333
You want a mystery? You should try
the pink dressing at the salad bar.

04:07.533 --> 04:10.467
Oh, geez. The mystery continues.

04:14.233 --> 04:17.767
Now, girls, remember.
Look everyone over very carefully.

04:17.834 --> 04:22.700
Try to figure out the real guests
from the actors pretending to be guests.

04:22.767 --> 04:25.734
It'll help when it comes
to solving the mysteries.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.100
Ok, Dorothy.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.834
If that's your real name.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.300
-How is that coffee?
-Terrific.

04:41.367 --> 04:42.467
Actor.

04:47.533 --> 04:50.900
Blanche, you're wearing my earrings.

04:51.300 --> 04:52.533
I know that.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.567
I asked you where they were
and you didn't know.

04:55.633 --> 04:57.200
Now you're wearing them.

04:57.266 --> 05:00.200
Well, Rose, there could be
two explanations.

05:00.533 --> 05:01.900
Either I was lying

05:01.967 --> 05:05.166
or I was wrong about the number
of explanations.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.867
-Blanche.
-Kendall.

05:12.133 --> 05:14.166
Blanche, I must commend you again.

05:14.233 --> 05:17.600
I feel we're in for a weekend
we'll never forget.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.834
Oh, I do declare.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.767
Your sweet words could charm
the morning dew

05:22.834 --> 05:24.400
right off the honeysuckle.

05:26.166 --> 05:29.033
That was good, Blanche.
Now do Br'er Rabbit.

05:32.333 --> 05:35.033
I believe the fun's about to begin.
Ladies.

05:35.600 --> 05:40.333
-Think I got to him, don't you?
-Your eyes are as good as rolled back.

05:41.567 --> 05:44.767
I believe things will turn out better than
I...

05:45.300 --> 05:48.200
Kendall's sitting with Posey McGlinn.

05:48.266 --> 05:51.300
She is my main rival
for that assistant's job.

05:51.367 --> 05:56.200
Look at the shameless way she's flirting
with him. Disgusting!

05:56.266 --> 05:59.400
-You flirted with him.
-I'm from the south.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.633
Flirting is part of my heritage.

06:04.133 --> 06:06.900
-What do you mean?
-Her mother was a slut, too.

06:11.867 --> 06:13.533
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:13.600 --> 06:20.600
I'm sure we all join his son,
his daughter, and his new bride Candy...

06:21.166 --> 06:27.433
in wishing many returns to our friend and
patron for 40 years, Giles Forsythe.

06:30.633 --> 06:33.367
-(gunshot)
-Aah!

06:35.100 --> 06:37.834
My God! They've been murdered!

06:41.867 --> 06:44.033
Does this mean we don't
get any birthday cake?

06:46.266 --> 06:47.934
Please, nobody touch anything.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.033
My name is Spade Marlowe.

06:50.433 --> 06:55.567
I'm a private detective retained
by the late philanthropist Giles Forsythe.

06:55.633 --> 06:59.100
When an 88-year-old man
marries a 22-year-old,

06:59.166 --> 07:00.834
he likes to know what she's up to.

07:02.667 --> 07:04.767
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but doesn't anybody but me think

07:04.834 --> 07:06.700
the hat's a little precious?

07:09.367 --> 07:10.467
(whistles)

07:13.767 --> 07:18.233
Today was Giles Forsythe's birthday,
and he intended, as always, to celebrate

07:18.300 --> 07:20.300
by having dinner here with his son
Philip...

07:20.633 --> 07:23.800
the well-known collector
of pre-Columbian artifacts...

07:23.867 --> 07:29.700
his spinster daughter Gloria,
and, of course, his new bride Candy.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.200
I've failed to protect my client,

07:33.266 --> 07:37.900
but I'm determined, with your help...
to solve these crimes

07:37.967 --> 07:40.033
and bring the murderer to justice.

07:40.100 --> 07:43.433
Maybe that bloody dagger
will lead us to the murder weapon.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.700
St. Olaf?

07:53.400 --> 07:55.066
Boy, he is good.

07:56.500 --> 08:00.367
-Unusual knife--
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cut the cake.

08:02.600 --> 08:03.867
I recognize that.

08:03.934 --> 08:08.900
-It's a rare Mayan sacrificial dagger.
-That could prove to be significant.

08:09.233 --> 08:12.533
Undoubtedly the weapon used
to kill Mrs. Forsythe...

08:12.834 --> 08:16.266
but obviously her husband...
was shot.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.500
Then there must be a gun.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.066
South side?

08:25.066 --> 08:26.767
Uncanny!

08:29.900 --> 08:31.066
Do you mind?

08:31.133 --> 08:33.934
Go right ahead.
You won't find anything.

08:37.333 --> 08:40.967
What I believe they refer to
as a purse gun...

08:42.200 --> 08:43.967
and it's been recently fired.

08:44.033 --> 08:45.633
I don't understand.

08:45.700 --> 08:47.166
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:47.233 --> 08:50.100
you now have enough clues
to solve these murders...

08:50.166 --> 08:53.166
who did it, how, and why?

08:53.233 --> 08:54.600
The butler did it.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.800
I'm a maître d'.

08:58.967 --> 09:01.800
Thank you. The maître d' did it!

09:02.500 --> 09:04.700
-Philip did it.
-Gloria did.

09:04.767 --> 09:07.367
It was colonel mustard in the library
with the candlestick.

09:08.467 --> 09:11.533
Oh. She says the butler did it,
and I'm the idiot?

09:13.166 --> 09:17.000
The answer is obvious.
They both did it.

09:17.600 --> 09:21.834
Now, if Ms. Smarty solves the crime,
she'll make a big impression on Kendall,

09:21.900 --> 09:24.467
and I can just kiss that job goodbye.

09:24.533 --> 09:27.000
Phillip was a collector
of pre-Columbian relics.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.734
Candy had her throat cut
with a Mayan dagger.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.667
He killed her.
The gun was in Gloria's purse.

09:32.734 --> 09:34.200
She killed her father.

09:34.800 --> 09:38.734
Nice try, ma'am, but Philip and Gloria
are innocent of those crimes.

09:38.800 --> 09:42.533
Perhaps.
But they are both murderers.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.834
Sit down, Dorothy.
Don't make a fool of yourself.

09:45.934 --> 09:47.200
You care to explain?

09:47.266 --> 09:51.200
In the first place, it's unlikely that
Gloria murdered her father.

09:51.266 --> 09:56.300
Statistics show that patricide
is overwhelmingly a male crime,

09:56.367 --> 09:59.433
although daughters
frequently murder their mothers.

10:02.867 --> 10:06.433
If Gloria had killed her father...

10:07.000 --> 10:11.934
would she then have tried
to conceal the weapon in her purse?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.133
I think not.

10:13.633 --> 10:17.834
The gun was obviously planted in her purse
to pin the murder on her.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.133
I've got it!

10:19.533 --> 10:22.166
A maître d' is some kind of waiter.

10:28.266 --> 10:29.600
On the other hand,

10:29.667 --> 10:33.834
Philip would never pick a Mayan
sacrificial knife as a murder weapon.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.100
Too obvious.

10:35.166 --> 10:41.200
But it would be no problem for his sister
to sneak the weapon out of his collection.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.266
This woman's pathetic.

10:43.333 --> 10:46.133
Oh, big news. Tear out the front page.

10:47.633 --> 10:51.967
Notice that the dagger was found
to the left of the victim.

10:53.066 --> 10:54.533
A throat...

10:57.233 --> 11:00.800
a throat is almost always cut from behind.

11:01.533 --> 11:04.200
Not part of the show, people!

11:06.233 --> 11:09.800
Being right-handed, I would slash
from left to right...

11:10.734 --> 11:14.900
but from the fact that the murder weapon
was dropped to the left,

11:14.967 --> 11:18.066
we can deduce that
the murderer is left-handed.

11:18.133 --> 11:19.567
Notice that Gloria,

11:19.633 --> 11:25.300
like most left-handed people,
wears her wristwatch on her right wrist.

11:25.967 --> 11:27.500
I think it's painfully clear

11:27.567 --> 11:31.333
that Philip and Gloria planned murders
to pin on each other.

11:31.400 --> 11:35.000
They knew the lights would be turned off
when the cake appeared

11:35.066 --> 11:36.800
because that happens every year.

11:36.867 --> 11:39.000
Coincidence? Hah!

11:39.066 --> 11:41.533
Siblings often think alike.

11:42.467 --> 11:46.867
You've given us a who, a how,
and a hah.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.734
But what about why?
What's the motive?

11:55.800 --> 11:59.633
When a 22-year-old
marries an 88-year-old...

12:00.200 --> 12:03.133
chances are she's not after his body.

12:07.233 --> 12:08.500
Oh, boy.

12:08.567 --> 12:12.166
Gloria and Philip were both afraid

12:12.233 --> 12:16.467
that Candy would persuade the old man
to change his will.

12:17.266 --> 12:19.967
And they both hoped
that pinning the crime on the other

12:20.033 --> 12:23.567
would make them the sole inheritor.

12:23.633 --> 12:26.500
Well, there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen.

12:26.567 --> 12:29.300
The who, how, and why.

12:34.867 --> 12:38.266
Dorothy, that was a real Tour de France.

12:40.533 --> 12:41.934
Thank you, Rose.

12:42.967 --> 12:46.834
Kendall just told me he needs
to be alone with me.

12:46.900 --> 12:50.867
-What did you do?
-I gave him my key to our room.

12:50.934 --> 12:54.467
Let me have yours, Rose.
Bunk with Dorothy and Sophia tonight.

12:54.533 --> 12:56.467
But we were roomies.

12:56.533 --> 12:59.600
Bunk with them or sleep in the closet.

13:00.166 --> 13:02.433
-Closet.
-Give me that key.

13:02.767 --> 13:04.934
(calm music playing)

13:05.000 --> 13:07.400
(knock on door)

13:07.467 --> 13:09.467
Coming, Kendall.

13:12.166 --> 13:16.266
-Compliments of Mr. Nesbitt.
-Well, how sweet. I'll take it.

13:16.333 --> 13:17.867
No, I've got it, ma'am.

13:19.133 --> 13:20.500
Oh, my God.

13:21.233 --> 13:23.233
Oh, my God!

13:24.200 --> 13:27.934
(calm music playing)

13:33.834 --> 13:36.066
-What is this all about?
-He's dead!

13:36.967 --> 13:38.800
Blanche, calm down.

13:38.867 --> 13:42.600
This is undoubtedly just another part
of the mystery weekend.

13:42.667 --> 13:45.233
Oh, yeah? He looks pretty dead to me.

13:45.700 --> 13:49.033
-All right. Ma, give me your mirror.
-What for?

13:49.367 --> 13:51.900
Every morning
I hold it under ma's nose.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.867
If it fogs up, I start the coffee.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.133
No breath.

14:02.367 --> 14:05.233
-Oh, my God, he's dead.
-Oh... God.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.934
I'm Vaczy, hotel security.
Nobody touch anything.

14:09.367 --> 14:12.266
-Nobody was here but her?
-That's right, sir.

14:15.633 --> 14:17.033
He's dead, all right.

14:17.300 --> 14:21.500
-Steak knife right through the heart.
-That must be what killed him.

14:24.233 --> 14:25.300
St. Olaf?

14:29.133 --> 14:30.900
It's like I'm wearing a sign.

14:31.567 --> 14:36.200
Everybody out of this room.
I'm clearing it till the police get here.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.900
Nobody leaves the hotel, especially you.

14:39.166 --> 14:41.300
As of now, you're the only suspect.

14:43.467 --> 14:48.066
(serene music playing)

14:50.367 --> 14:52.867
If they put me in prison,
I'll be brave.

14:53.633 --> 14:57.033
Blanche, you don't understand.
They'll put you in a women's prison.

15:02.367 --> 15:04.834
Don't let me go, Dorothy.

15:04.900 --> 15:08.033
Honey, you are not going to go
because you are not guilty.

15:08.100 --> 15:11.633
I understand you can have anything
for your last meal...

15:12.200 --> 15:14.266
just ice cream if you want.

15:15.734 --> 15:19.533
-I think I'm going to be sick.
-You're not helping, Rose.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.333
It's as though you believe
Blanche is guilty.

15:22.400 --> 15:26.633
Well, she lied about my earrings,
and she took them.

15:26.700 --> 15:31.166
I mean, deceit, then theft,
isn't murder the next logical step?

15:32.400 --> 15:33.967
St. Olaf, right?

15:36.367 --> 15:39.533
Face it. Blanche was discovered
in a locked room.

15:39.600 --> 15:44.066
Only she and the victim had keys.
I mean, give me another explanation.

15:44.133 --> 15:46.000
The trouble is, I can't.

15:46.066 --> 15:49.800
Come on, pussycat.
You figured out that mystery at dinner.

15:49.867 --> 15:52.934
Oh, Ma. That was a game, this is life.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.300
Oh, that's right.
You've never been good at life.

15:57.767 --> 16:01.033
How can I be accused of murder?

16:01.100 --> 16:03.166
I am a Devereaux.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.900
Things like this usually happen
to people named Petrillo.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.467
I take offense at that.

16:08.533 --> 16:13.000
No one in my family ever,
ever left a body to be found.

16:15.233 --> 16:21.100
(mellow music playing)

16:24.367 --> 16:29.533
I'm lieutenant Alvarez, Dade County
homicide, and here's what I got.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.834
At around 9:45 last night,

16:31.900 --> 16:36.367
this guy went to room 405
carrying champagne ordered by Nesbitt.

16:36.967 --> 16:40.667
He was admitted by Blanche Devereaux
and discovered the corpse.

16:40.734 --> 16:43.967
Miss Devereaux and this dead guy
had the only two keys.

16:44.433 --> 16:49.266
Forensics say the cause of death was
a stab wound inflicted by a steak knife.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.400
We know miss Devereaux
had steak for dinner.

16:52.467 --> 16:55.433
Given these facts,
unless somebody has something else...

16:55.767 --> 16:59.533
-we got enough to make an arrest.
-My, my, Mr. Officer.

16:59.967 --> 17:03.400
I do declare your sweet words
could charm the morning dew

17:03.467 --> 17:05.233
right off the honeysuckle.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.500
Blanche, not now.

17:09.233 --> 17:11.066
If not now, when?

17:13.567 --> 17:17.200
-Blanche Devereaux--
-Wait. You haven't established a motive.

17:17.266 --> 17:21.967
I'll give you a motive.
That woman gave Kendall her room key.

17:22.033 --> 17:23.367
I saw her do it.

17:23.433 --> 17:28.166
She planned to seduce him to ensure
she'd win the job as his assistant.

17:28.834 --> 17:31.100
She got the other key
from that woman there.

17:31.166 --> 17:34.233
She tore off her clothes...

17:34.300 --> 17:36.800
That's Velcro.
It gives the illusion of a tear.

17:41.467 --> 17:43.467
She flung her dress on the bed,

17:43.533 --> 17:46.200
slipped into a negligee,
and awaited her prey.

17:46.600 --> 17:50.567
She didn't realize the reason Kendall
went to her room...

17:51.066 --> 17:53.734
the reason Kendall ordered champagne,
was to let her down easy.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.066
He'd promised the job to me.

17:56.700 --> 18:00.033
The reason he went to her room
rather than his was that...

18:00.900 --> 18:04.533
-I was sharing his room.
-Slut!

18:06.200 --> 18:09.166
When Kendall told her the truth,
she flew into a jealous rage.

18:09.233 --> 18:11.367
She plunged the steak knife into his
chest.

18:11.433 --> 18:13.700
That tramp murdered my lover.

18:14.166 --> 18:16.633
I know Blanche Devereaux, lieutenant,

18:16.700 --> 18:19.333
and this tramp is incapable of
committing murder.

18:23.867 --> 18:27.967
We got a motive, we got a weapon,
and we got one suspect with no alibi.

18:28.033 --> 18:30.467
Blanche Devereaux,
I'm charging you with murder.

18:30.800 --> 18:34.100
-You have the right to remain--
-Why would she bring a steak knife

18:34.166 --> 18:36.500
to a romantic liaison?

18:36.567 --> 18:40.133
It could have been for anything. I'm not
familiar with her sexual proclivities.

18:41.567 --> 18:43.000
What are you, a rookie?

18:46.300 --> 18:50.467
You haven't answered the question
of how somebody else got into the room.

18:50.533 --> 18:52.333
What if there was a knock at the door?

18:52.734 --> 18:56.166
Nesbitt might have assumed
it was the waiter.

18:56.233 --> 18:58.500
-That's speculation.
-One more point.

18:58.567 --> 19:02.200
The hotel security chief
cordoned off the room...

19:02.600 --> 19:05.967
so the only people who saw the room
after the murder,

19:06.033 --> 19:07.967
other than you and your staff...

19:08.266 --> 19:11.500
were the waiter, the security chief,
and the four of us.

19:11.934 --> 19:13.066
So?

19:13.133 --> 19:16.300
When miss McGlinn was reconstructing
the murder scene,

19:16.600 --> 19:21.233
she described Blanche's dress
being slung over the bed.

19:21.300 --> 19:22.767
It was. I saw it.

19:22.834 --> 19:27.500
Miss McGlinn could only have seen it
if she'd been there prior to the murder.

19:29.066 --> 19:30.867
I think I see now how it happened.

19:31.734 --> 19:33.700
Last evening at dinner...

19:34.033 --> 19:37.367
when miss McGlinn saw Blanche
give Kendall Nesbitt her key,

19:37.433 --> 19:39.300
she was furious.

19:39.834 --> 19:42.033
She dropped a steak knife into her purse--

19:42.100 --> 19:44.967
-So? I took a place setting.
-Not now, Ma!

19:51.934 --> 19:54.700
And when she felt
that she wouldn't be missed,

19:54.767 --> 19:58.633
she slipped out of the dining room
and headed upstairs.

19:59.100 --> 20:01.767
Kendall had let himself
into Blanche's room

20:01.834 --> 20:03.500
while she was in the shower

20:03.567 --> 20:07.667
and was making himself comfortable
when there was a knock at the door.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.600
Thinking it was the champagne,
he opened the door.

20:10.934 --> 20:14.100
Posey was there.
She accused him of two-timing.

20:14.166 --> 20:17.600
He denied it.
Posey pulled out a steak knife,

20:17.667 --> 20:19.166
plunged it into his chest...

20:19.567 --> 20:23.734
and left the room
before Blanche could discover her.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.333
Jealous rage was the motive, all right,
but Blanche wasn't the murderer.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.233
There's your murderer.

20:30.900 --> 20:32.333
Posey McGlinn.

20:32.834 --> 20:36.066
Well, miss McGlinn,
what do you have to say?

20:36.133 --> 20:39.567
You've stuck your nose in
for the last time.

20:39.633 --> 20:41.633
-Aah!
-(gunshot)

20:42.800 --> 20:46.633
Posey McGlinn, I charge you
with the murder of Kendall Nesbitt.

20:46.700 --> 20:49.433
Lieutenant Alvarez,
that won't be necessary.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.900
I seem to have
recovered from my death.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.066
I'd like to thank
the Maltese Falcon Club

20:55.133 --> 20:59.867
and particularly Blanche Devereaux for
giving us a weekend we'll never forget.

20:59.934 --> 21:01.266
Thank you for coming.

21:07.333 --> 21:10.900
-So, wait a minute.
-Those guys were all in on it?

21:10.967 --> 21:13.533
-I was, too.
-You were not.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.200
Oh, all right. I was not.

21:19.166 --> 21:21.533
I hate to be the brunt of jokes.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.967
Funny. You don't mind being the brunt
of limericks.

21:26.834 --> 21:28.533
That's different. That's poetry.

21:29.233 --> 21:31.967
There's one thing I don't understand.

21:32.266 --> 21:35.500
When I checked to make sure Kendall
was really dead...

21:35.967 --> 21:38.500
why didn't his breath show up
on your mirror?

21:38.567 --> 21:42.133
Simple. The mirror had been sprayed
with defogger.

21:42.200 --> 21:46.533
-Who could have done that?
-I did. The club people asked me to.

21:46.600 --> 21:49.767
Why would you do such a cruel thing?

21:49.834 --> 21:53.266
Well, Blanche, there could be
two explanations.

21:56.967 --> 22:01.333
Either I was getting back at you
for taking my earrings, or...

22:02.266 --> 22:05.433
oh, who are we kidding?
That's why I did it.

22:07.066 --> 22:12.934
This whole thing is unbelievable.
Kendall, you're not dead.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.567
-I didn't kill anybody.
-And I didn't take any silverware.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.667
Does this mean I'm still being considered
for the job?

22:23.734 --> 22:26.400
-Of course.
-Oh, well.

22:26.467 --> 22:31.166
So this was all a mockery.
No crimes were committed at all.

22:31.233 --> 22:32.734
What a load of fun.

22:40.767 --> 22:43.533
Pussycat, help me carry my purse
to the car.

22:51.400 --> 22:57.266
(theme music playing)
