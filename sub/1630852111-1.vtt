00:37.625 --> 00:39.958
<i>"Do you believe in love at first sight?"</i>

00:40.541 --> 00:41.500
<i>"Me neither."</i>

00:42.375 --> 00:46.625
<i>Those were the words that started</i>
<i>the whole Emma Gale success story.</i>

00:47.625 --> 00:52.625
<i>And for 20 years and 12 novels,</i>
<i>it seemed like nothing could go wrong.</i>

00:54.375 --> 00:55.291
<i>Until now.</i>

00:59.916 --> 01:02.500
Hello, Ms. Brown.
Welcome to <i>The Drew Barrymore Show.</i>

01:02.583 --> 01:03.416
Thank you.

01:08.083 --> 01:11.750
Can't I just go home
and wait until this blows over?

01:11.833 --> 01:14.750
This is not blowing over.
This is a Category 5.

01:15.333 --> 01:18.875
Do you know how many people hate you
because of this book?

01:18.958 --> 01:20.708
<i>Bring back Winston!</i>

01:20.791 --> 01:21.916
A lot?

01:24.333 --> 01:25.541
It's showtime.

01:26.541 --> 01:30.041
-I thought you were my friend.
-Well, right now, I'm your agent.

01:30.125 --> 01:34.458
So go out there
and charm everybody's pants off.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.500
And try not to look so tall.

01:37.583 --> 01:38.875
It's intimidating.

01:44.916 --> 01:49.291
I suppose it's possible you might not
have read a Sophie Brown novel,

01:49.375 --> 01:52.583
but trust me, you know somebody who has,

01:52.666 --> 01:55.041
and, boy,
do I have some questions for her.

01:55.125 --> 01:55.958
Hm.

01:56.041 --> 02:01.250
Join us in welcoming back my good friend
and best-selling author, Sophie Brown!

02:03.791 --> 02:06.166
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

02:07.208 --> 02:08.291
-Hi.
-Hi.

02:08.375 --> 02:11.625
Thank you for having me.
I'm surprised I made it in alive.

02:11.708 --> 02:13.041
I barely did.

02:13.125 --> 02:16.125
All of you viewers, if you wonder
what we're talking about,

02:16.208 --> 02:21.750
I'd say that Sophie Brown
has a whole lot of unhappy fans out there.

02:22.375 --> 02:25.625
Well, I think you might mean former fans.

02:25.708 --> 02:30.583
Well, I guess we're all wondering
about the ending of your latest book.

02:30.666 --> 02:34.500
I know that the character of Winston
charmed many of the readers.

02:34.583 --> 02:37.333
Then why in the world would you kill him?

02:37.416 --> 02:40.666
-The readers, they loved Winston.

02:40.750 --> 02:43.791
Maybe they just didn't know him
like I did.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.125
We don't always get the happy ending.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.541
You know, I normally don't do this,

02:49.625 --> 02:52.500
but I have got to agree
with the fans out there.

02:52.583 --> 02:55.666
He didn't deserve to fall down the stairs.

02:55.750 --> 02:57.208
So you're on their side?

02:57.291 --> 03:00.458
Well, you murdered a man
that I was in love with.

03:00.541 --> 03:03.416
I mean, what gives you the right
to take him away?

03:03.500 --> 03:05.208
Well, I'm… I'm the author.

03:05.291 --> 03:08.583
I know,
but perhaps you're having a hard time

03:08.666 --> 03:12.583
separating your real life
from the fiction in your books.

03:13.583 --> 03:15.666
-What?
-Well, you've had a rough year.

03:15.750 --> 03:19.000
Your husband left you.
You had a very messy divorce.

03:19.083 --> 03:21.500
Okay, but Winston
is a fictional character.

03:21.583 --> 03:23.000
-Was he?
-Yes.

03:23.083 --> 03:26.500
And you should be happy
that it was a quick death, yeah,

03:26.583 --> 03:29.083
because I could have extended it
for ten pages.

03:29.166 --> 03:34.125
I could have dragged him behind a car.
I could have poisoned him with mercury.

03:34.208 --> 03:37.125
I could have chopped him
into little, teeny pieces

03:37.208 --> 03:38.791
and fed him to the sharks!

03:40.291 --> 03:43.125
-We'll be right back.

03:47.041 --> 03:49.458
I became a writer
so I could write in my pajamas,

03:49.541 --> 03:51.333
not so I could get yelled at by strangers.

03:52.208 --> 03:54.458
I thought you became a writer
because of Grandpa.

03:54.541 --> 03:57.458
You used to sit in the barbershop
and listen to his stories, right?

03:57.541 --> 03:58.416
Yeah.

03:59.083 --> 04:00.416
About the castle.

04:01.083 --> 04:02.833
-About Scotland.
-Mm.

04:02.916 --> 04:05.333
He had told me that he snuck in once.

04:06.750 --> 04:07.583
Yep.

04:08.791 --> 04:10.166
He told that one a lot.

04:14.333 --> 04:17.250
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
'Cause I can come back next weekend.

04:17.333 --> 04:20.333
Absolutely not. You stay at school.

04:20.416 --> 04:22.291
Don't worry about me. I got this.

04:23.291 --> 04:24.125
Okay.

04:32.250 --> 04:35.125
<i>I need to forget about</i>
<i>the Emma Gale fiasco for a while.</i>

04:37.375 --> 04:38.750
<i>I need to go away.</i>

04:49.208 --> 04:50.500
<i>Dun Dunbar.</i>

04:51.458 --> 04:52.708
<i>The castle.</i>

04:53.833 --> 04:55.125
<i>I'll go to Scotland.</i>

04:55.708 --> 04:59.416
It's hidden away, and it's quiet,
and nobody knows me there.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.291
<i>Mom, this is great.</i>

05:02.375 --> 05:04.083
<i>You're finally taking a vacation.</i>

05:04.583 --> 05:05.958
Not a vacation.

05:06.875 --> 05:08.208
A working trip.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.083
Just until the bad press dies down.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.375
I can write the new Emma Gale,

05:14.166 --> 05:17.791
bring Winston back,
and everything will be back to normal.

05:17.875 --> 05:21.291
<i>All right, well,</i>
<i>at least promise me you'll see the castle.</i>

05:22.625 --> 05:23.458
I promise.

05:37.375 --> 05:38.416
That's me.

05:38.916 --> 05:40.000
Ah, you're American.

05:40.083 --> 05:41.125
Yes.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.875
Nobody told me that.

05:44.791 --> 05:45.708
Whereabouts?

05:46.708 --> 05:47.708
Uh-huh.

05:47.791 --> 05:49.125
Where are you from?

05:50.041 --> 05:52.000
No. No.

05:52.666 --> 05:54.666
This is all the luggage I have.

05:54.750 --> 05:57.166
-It's not a problem.
-Oh. Thank you.

07:26.375 --> 07:29.125
-Hamish, no! Hamish, stop!

07:35.833 --> 07:38.708
Well, I'm glad you were… here.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.041
He, uh…

07:40.125 --> 07:42.041
…doesn't usually like strangers.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.625
-Neither do you, ya dobber.

07:47.250 --> 07:48.250
Thank you.

07:50.458 --> 07:51.375
Enjoy your stay, then.

07:52.833 --> 07:55.083
Hey.
Are you the welcoming committee?

08:04.666 --> 08:06.875
Oh, hi. May I help you?

08:06.958 --> 08:07.958
I'm checking in.

08:08.041 --> 08:09.458
Very good. Follow me.

08:11.208 --> 08:12.958
Isn't that Sophie Brown?

08:13.041 --> 08:15.458
In our wee village? Dinna be daft.

08:16.541 --> 08:19.208
-Welcome to the village inn.
-Thank you.

08:19.291 --> 08:22.291
I have a reservation under Sophie Brown.

08:26.250 --> 08:27.875
Sophie Brown, the author?

08:28.750 --> 08:31.666
Not sure I should admit it, but, uh, yes.

08:31.750 --> 08:34.958
I've read all your books.
I just finished the last one.

08:35.041 --> 08:36.166
Wonderful.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.333
-May I ask you a question, then?
-Sure.

08:38.416 --> 08:40.958
Why'd you leave it so long
to kill off Winston?

08:41.958 --> 08:44.208
-What?
-I was hoping you'd do it in volume one.

08:44.291 --> 08:47.041
I never liked that sod.
Too bloody perfect.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.750
It's…

08:49.833 --> 08:53.208
You know what?
I'm not so sure I did either.

08:55.250 --> 08:56.500
-Bugger.
-Bugger.

08:57.500 --> 09:01.041
-I killed him off.
-Good for you, Sophie Brown.

09:01.125 --> 09:03.708
Sod. Got any other names for him?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.583
Oh, it's lovely.

09:08.083 --> 09:12.083
That's very kind.
I'm sure it's not what you're used to.

09:12.166 --> 09:13.791
Actually…

09:13.875 --> 09:16.041
…it is exactly what I was hoping for.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.916
Is Dun Dunbar Castle nearby?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.125
Aye, it's just over the hill.

09:26.208 --> 09:29.166
Well, if you need anything else,
Ms. Brown, just ring.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.375
Thank you. And it's Sophie.

09:31.875 --> 09:32.708
Maisie.

09:32.791 --> 09:34.250
Nice to meet you, Maisie.

09:34.333 --> 09:35.291
You too.

09:37.500 --> 09:41.583
<i>Scotland? Really?</i>
<i>Why didn't you clear this with me first?</i>

09:41.666 --> 09:45.166
Because you would have
talked me out of it.

09:45.250 --> 09:48.208
<i>-How long have we known each other?</i>
-Too long.

09:48.291 --> 09:50.916
<i>Since page one, book four.</i>

09:51.000 --> 09:53.083
<i>And when have I ever steered you wrong?</i>

09:53.166 --> 09:55.583
-The title of book six.
<i>-Oh, aside from that!</i>

09:55.666 --> 09:57.500
Don't worry. I'm here to write.

09:57.583 --> 10:00.458
<i>Good, and when can I expect to see pages?</i>

10:00.541 --> 10:03.041
Soon. It's practically writing itself.

10:03.666 --> 10:05.958
-Goodbye.
<i>-Bye. </i>

10:43.708 --> 10:46.833
Right, now, the gift shop is right here.

10:46.916 --> 10:48.666
-No, thank you.

10:49.250 --> 10:51.708
Uh, no, you've missed the… the gift shop.

10:52.500 --> 10:56.125
No? Well, surely you don't wanna leave
without a souvenir.

10:56.208 --> 10:57.166
No, thank you.

10:57.250 --> 11:02.250
Kilts, tea towels, coasters?
All with the clan coat of arms, of course.

11:02.333 --> 11:03.750
But of course.

11:03.833 --> 11:06.791
Well, may your travels be swift.

11:11.083 --> 11:12.458
Something on your mind?

11:13.208 --> 11:14.041
Several things.

11:14.125 --> 11:17.833
Aye, well, perhaps one of them
could be fixing the door to the library.

11:17.916 --> 11:21.916
-It's hard to get the people in.
-Aye, it's even harder to get them out.

11:23.541 --> 11:24.375
Hello there.

11:25.125 --> 11:25.958
Hi.

11:27.750 --> 11:31.208
-So you work here too?
-Wherever they'll have me.

11:31.291 --> 11:34.041
You just missed the tour,
but the next one's Thursday.

11:34.791 --> 11:38.458
Oh, well, um, could I just
wander around a little on my own?

11:38.541 --> 11:39.833
I'm afraid that's not--

11:39.916 --> 11:42.833
It's all right, Thomas.
I'll give her a tour.

11:44.166 --> 11:47.333
-I wouldn't want to get you in trouble.
-Take my chances.

11:50.833 --> 11:51.833
This way.

11:55.875 --> 11:59.125
There are more than 3,000 castles
in Scotland.

11:59.208 --> 12:01.791
Some date back to the 14th century.

12:01.875 --> 12:04.375
These grand old ladies
hold the proud history

12:04.458 --> 12:07.250
of all those who lived,
worked, and fought here.

12:08.333 --> 12:09.958
Look at that staircase.

12:10.041 --> 12:11.916
Aye, it's one of five.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.458
What's up there?

12:14.583 --> 12:15.583
Upper floors.

12:20.041 --> 12:22.125
This here is the music room

12:22.208 --> 12:24.500
where the third duchess
wrote a book of poems.

12:24.583 --> 12:27.250
-Have you read it?
-Aye, and I wouldn't recommend it.

12:28.250 --> 12:31.333
-So you're here for the day, then?
-A little longer.

12:31.416 --> 12:34.041
Aye. Tourists don't usually
stay in our village.

12:34.541 --> 12:36.333
We're more of what you call
a drive-through.

12:42.666 --> 12:43.708
Oh.

12:46.083 --> 12:50.208
Dun Dunbar was built
by the first Duke of Dunbar for his wife.

12:50.958 --> 12:53.291
Been in the same family for 500 years.

12:54.791 --> 12:57.333
-Who owns it now?
-Just some royal arse.

12:58.916 --> 13:01.250
-Hamish! Hamish.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.625
-Oh my goodness. Oh!

13:03.708 --> 13:05.125
-No! No!
-Okay. Hi.

13:05.208 --> 13:07.666
Never seen him like this.
Have you meat in your pocket?

13:10.083 --> 13:12.750
I always carry a steak on my person.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.291
Out now. Go on. Get out. Go on!

13:18.916 --> 13:20.083
I'm sorry.

13:20.166 --> 13:21.000
It's okay.

13:32.083 --> 13:35.458
So, this is the older part of the castle.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.250
Dates back to 1500.

13:39.625 --> 13:44.333
The Dunbars had meetings of the clan
and grand celebrations in here.

13:44.916 --> 13:46.166
Come on. There's more.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.666
This staircase was built clockwise.

13:49.208 --> 13:52.875
Apparently, the best way to defend
by a right-handed swordsman.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.625
Hm. Hm.

13:54.708 --> 13:55.958
What's up at the top?

13:56.041 --> 13:59.291
Twelve bedrooms and ten bathrooms.

13:59.375 --> 14:00.333
Oh.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.083
Wow.

14:03.958 --> 14:07.083
I guess the, uh, royal arse
needs a lot of thrones.

14:07.166 --> 14:08.083
Never enough.

14:08.708 --> 14:11.458
-Can we go up?
-Sorry, not part of the tour.

14:11.541 --> 14:14.500
Can I steal you away from the tour
for a moment?

14:14.583 --> 14:15.416
Can it wait?

14:15.916 --> 14:17.916
There's a couple wanting
to talk about a wedding.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.500
All right. How do they look?

14:19.583 --> 14:21.958
-Like they can afford it.
-Stay put.

14:23.000 --> 14:23.958
I won't be long.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.208
Top

14:32.291 --> 14:33.375
of the circular…

14:34.958 --> 14:35.958
…staircase…

14:38.208 --> 14:39.125
…there's

14:39.750 --> 14:40.583
a hallway.

14:44.750 --> 14:45.583
Okay.

14:46.291 --> 14:49.166
At the top of the stairs,
there are three doors.

14:49.708 --> 14:52.083
One, two, three.

15:03.041 --> 15:04.125
Hello?

15:05.458 --> 15:06.291
Miss?

15:07.208 --> 15:08.250
Hello?

15:10.166 --> 15:11.166
Hello?

15:12.208 --> 15:14.166
-Hello, miss?

15:14.750 --> 15:15.583
Miss?

15:27.958 --> 15:29.791
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry.

15:29.875 --> 15:31.500
I just needed to see something.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.583
And what could you possibly need
to see up here?

15:33.666 --> 15:36.791
Okay, the thing is, I have
a little family history in this place.

15:36.875 --> 15:38.583
-Oh, do you now?
-Yes.

15:38.666 --> 15:39.708
Don't tell me.

15:39.791 --> 15:44.125
You did a DNA test,
and your ancestor's Mary Queen of Scots?

15:44.208 --> 15:45.250
I said I was sorry.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.458
Do you know why no one's allowed up here?

15:47.541 --> 15:49.250
I'm guessing frostbite.

15:49.333 --> 15:50.791
Because it's someone's home.

15:50.875 --> 15:54.291
How would you like a parade of gawkers
traipsing through yours?

15:54.791 --> 15:55.916
Tour's over.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.541
Uh, that'll be £20.

16:02.125 --> 16:04.208
The sign says ten.

16:04.291 --> 16:05.791
Private tour's more.

16:09.208 --> 16:10.833
Ah, I dinna have change.

16:10.916 --> 16:14.625
Well, consider it a tip
for your warmth and hospitality.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.166
Well, here's a tip for you.

16:16.666 --> 16:19.750
Stay out of places you don't belong.

16:22.375 --> 16:24.000
Keep him away from people.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.583
Right. Well, we try.

16:26.916 --> 16:28.416
What was all that about?

16:31.208 --> 16:32.208
Book the wedding.

16:35.833 --> 16:38.541
"Mary Queen of Scots."

16:39.291 --> 16:42.916
-I would love to see you dance.
-Well, those were the days.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.791
-Go on, then. Give us a show.

16:45.875 --> 16:47.375
-Oh, I'd like to see that.
-Hi.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.750
-Enjoy the castle?
-I did, yes. It was magical.

16:51.833 --> 16:52.875
I love your books.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
-I rather love them too.
-We've read every one.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.916
-I told them not to bother you.
-Are you kidding?

16:59.000 --> 17:02.208
You may be the only readers left
who don't hate me.

17:02.708 --> 17:05.708
So, knitting in a pub?

17:05.791 --> 17:06.958
Do you knit?

17:07.041 --> 17:09.666
Oh, no.
I mean, I've always wanted to learn, but…

17:09.750 --> 17:14.291
Oh! Well, these might come in handy.

17:14.375 --> 17:16.458
Then you can join our club.

17:17.291 --> 17:18.833
Thank you. Um…

17:18.916 --> 17:19.958
Helen.

17:20.041 --> 17:20.958
I'm Sophie.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.416
Uh-huh.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.708
I'm Rhona.

17:23.791 --> 17:28.500
I'm a pastry chef, but for now, I make
biscuits in the bakery across the way.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.041
Thank you.

17:31.916 --> 17:33.000
Mm.

17:33.625 --> 17:36.500
Mmm. Mm-hmm. Oh.

17:36.583 --> 17:37.916
These are…

17:38.000 --> 17:39.083
…delicious!

17:39.791 --> 17:41.625
And this is Angus.

17:48.375 --> 17:52.083
His husband was one
of the original members, but he passed on.

17:52.833 --> 17:56.500
Not long after, Angus showed up.
Hasn't stopped knitting since.

17:56.583 --> 17:59.666
Here, would you like me
to show you how to knit?

17:59.750 --> 18:00.916
Yes, please.

18:01.583 --> 18:02.916
Well, come on, then.

18:03.958 --> 18:05.916
-Not letting this go though.
-No.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.125
Mm-mm.

18:07.208 --> 18:09.625
That is my daughter, Lexi.

18:09.708 --> 18:11.375
She's away at college now.

18:11.458 --> 18:14.708
-Oh, it's hard when they move away.
-It's harder when they move back in.

18:16.750 --> 18:17.708
And your husband?

18:18.541 --> 18:21.083
Uh, it's been a year since my divorce.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.416
-Oh.
-It's been four since mine.

18:24.958 --> 18:27.750
I've got a boyfriend in the bakery.

18:27.833 --> 18:30.750
-He just doesn't know it yet!
-I'm still married.

18:30.833 --> 18:33.583
Although, I'm not sure he knows it either.

18:33.666 --> 18:36.375
-Not true. You two are madly in love.

18:36.458 --> 18:37.541
We are.

18:40.708 --> 18:44.791
It's nice to hear him laugh like that.
He hasn't spoken a word since Graham died.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.958
I still can't believe

18:47.041 --> 18:50.000
you chose our little village
to write the next Emma Gale!

18:50.666 --> 18:54.375
Well, I was supposed to come here
a long time ago with my dad.

18:55.583 --> 18:58.375
But he got sick, and we never made it.

18:59.041 --> 19:00.333
I'm so sorry.

19:00.416 --> 19:02.833
He lived at Dunbar Castle as a kid.

19:02.916 --> 19:06.041
Well, outside the castle.
They weren't allowed inside.

19:06.125 --> 19:10.291
-His family, they were the groundskeepers.
-You mean your family?

19:10.958 --> 19:13.291
My family. The McGuintys.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.333
Ah, you're one of us, then.

19:16.416 --> 19:19.125
McGuinty. I… I don't think
I've heard that name around here.

19:19.208 --> 19:21.416
Well, they moved to New York
when he was a boy.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.750
I was at school with a McGuinty
back in the day.

19:25.375 --> 19:27.291
A real talker, that one.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.750
Always blethering and telling the tales.

19:29.833 --> 19:32.375
-Callum McGuinty?

19:33.083 --> 19:34.166
That's him.

19:34.875 --> 19:37.333
Of course, we called him something else.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.125
McMotormouth.

19:42.583 --> 19:45.083
Oh, you have his smile.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.541
Oh, I don't know why I'm crying.

19:53.625 --> 19:56.333
Because these are your roots, dear.

19:58.708 --> 20:00.291
I wish I'd come back sooner.

20:00.375 --> 20:02.875
-Well, you're here now.
-Mm-hmm.

20:02.958 --> 20:05.625
And you got to see Dun Dunbar
while it's still a castle.

20:06.750 --> 20:09.333
-What do you mean?
-It's… it's up for sale.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.416
A lot of the old castles are for sale.

20:11.500 --> 20:14.416
Aberdeenshire's cheaper
than a Range Rover.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.833
And you'd be more comfortable
living in a Range Rover.

20:19.291 --> 20:21.708
-Oh, Angus.
-Wow. Thank you.

20:21.791 --> 20:23.125
That's great.

20:44.541 --> 20:46.750
So someone wants a trophy castle?

20:49.958 --> 20:51.583
I didn't get that feeling.

20:51.666 --> 20:56.041
It's worse, then. They wanna tear it down
for condos and a golf course.

20:56.125 --> 20:57.291
Here's the offer.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.583
And it's rather large.

20:59.666 --> 21:02.750
I'm doing the tours and the gift shop.

21:02.833 --> 21:05.916
I've agreed to the weddings
and… and maybe even a funeral or two.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.125
Maybe your own.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.333
Look, we've been mates for a long time.

21:10.416 --> 21:13.166
I've bent over backwards,
keeping you out of foreclosure.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.625
I just need a little more time, Ian.

21:15.708 --> 21:19.625
There is no more time
unless you sell off the farmlands.

21:19.708 --> 21:21.541
No, I can't do that.

21:23.250 --> 21:25.500
-Myles--
-No, it's out of the question!

21:26.000 --> 21:28.208
Uh, Ms. Brown has arrived.

21:28.291 --> 21:32.208
-Sophie Brown. Myles Dunbar.
-You're the royal arse?

21:32.291 --> 21:35.125
-You're the buyer?
-He let me think he worked here.

21:35.208 --> 21:36.791
It is work being me.

21:36.875 --> 21:41.041
And you can't just show up and decide
to buy a castle, like some hamburger.

21:41.125 --> 21:44.458
-Well, you did say it was a drive-through.
-I'm not selling to her.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.083
Mr. Dunbar.

21:46.166 --> 21:47.791
Technically it's "Duke."

21:47.875 --> 21:50.416
Uh, Myles is the 12th Duke of Dunbar.

21:51.041 --> 21:54.125
Oh, well, forgive me, Your Highness.

21:54.666 --> 21:56.500
Technically, it's "Your Grace."

21:57.541 --> 21:59.000
-Ah!

22:02.041 --> 22:04.750
I can think
of a few other names I'd call you.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.291
And you wouldn't be the first.

22:09.291 --> 22:10.291
And FYI,

22:10.375 --> 22:12.666
the title does not come with the land.

22:12.750 --> 22:16.666
So if that's what you're after,
you can buy a ladyship online for £30.

22:16.750 --> 22:19.583
The only title I'm interested in
is my next book,

22:20.458 --> 22:23.625
which I'm going to write
at Dun Dunbar in the library.

22:26.583 --> 22:30.000
I'm not giving up 500 years of history
on someone's whim.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.333
-It is not a whim.
-Oh my. What is it, then?

22:33.208 --> 22:35.250
Do you believe in love at first sight?

22:35.333 --> 22:37.333
No, I don't.

22:37.416 --> 22:38.250
Me neither.

22:38.875 --> 22:42.958
But if I did, that would be
what I felt when I saw Dun Dunbar.

22:43.041 --> 22:44.291
It felt like home.

22:44.375 --> 22:45.958
Aye. My home.

22:46.041 --> 22:47.375
My father's too.

22:48.375 --> 22:51.125
On the grounds. A long time ago.

22:51.208 --> 22:54.333
-His family worked for yours.
-Try again.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.958
I thought that dukes
were supposed to be gentlemen.

22:58.458 --> 23:00.041
Those are English dukes.

23:03.208 --> 23:04.041
Well…

23:04.125 --> 23:05.875
…this was clearly a mistake.

23:05.958 --> 23:07.375
-Yes, it was.
-Thank you.

23:07.458 --> 23:10.208
-You're welcome.
-Not you. Him.

23:14.333 --> 23:19.833
You realize you just
handed over Dun Dunbar to the bank?

23:27.166 --> 23:28.458
What can I get you?

23:28.541 --> 23:30.250
What do you, uh, recommend

23:30.333 --> 23:33.625
to obliterate the memory of the most
awful, arrogant person you've ever met?

23:33.708 --> 23:35.791
-Got just the thing.
-Mm.

23:38.916 --> 23:39.750
Thank you.

23:46.291 --> 23:47.291
Ah.

23:50.041 --> 23:51.458
Whiskey. Large.

23:55.750 --> 23:56.958
You'll keep Thomas on.

23:57.750 --> 23:58.583
What?

23:59.083 --> 24:00.750
He's lived here his whole life.

24:00.833 --> 24:02.333
I've had a change of heart.

24:02.416 --> 24:04.250
Oh, so you actually have one.

24:04.833 --> 24:07.500
If I agree to this, there are conditions.

24:08.458 --> 24:10.833
Ninety-day escrow till Christmas.

24:10.916 --> 24:12.500
Deposit's non-refundable.

24:13.208 --> 24:15.208
-What else?
-You'll move in now.

24:15.791 --> 24:17.041
-Now?
-Aye.

24:17.958 --> 24:19.875
-Are you moving out?
-No.

24:22.125 --> 24:23.625
I am not living with you.

24:25.250 --> 24:29.416
Look, this has nothing
to do with you and me.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.125
There is no you and me.

24:31.208 --> 24:35.125
Exactly. If I'm gonna sell the old girl,
I need to know you can take care of her.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.458
And you need to know how hard that is.

24:38.958 --> 24:41.916
Dun Dunbar is a living, breathing thing.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.708
She needs constant attention,

24:44.375 --> 24:47.083
or she'll crumble
like an oatcake in the rain.

25:01.000 --> 25:01.833
Gift shop?

25:01.916 --> 25:03.750
Two quid. I'll throw it into the deal.

25:08.375 --> 25:12.000
She'll realize the mistake she made
and be gone in a week.

25:12.083 --> 25:14.875
Meanwhile, her deposit
will get us through spring,

25:14.958 --> 25:17.291
and I'll figure out something after that.

25:18.583 --> 25:21.541
-And if she doesn't leave?
-Oh, she'll leave.

25:22.083 --> 25:25.541
I'll make her life so miserable
she'll never want to see a castle again.

25:25.625 --> 25:29.541
Aye. Well, you do have a knack
of driving people away.

25:30.250 --> 25:31.458
You're still here.

25:31.541 --> 25:35.791
Aye, but you pay me. Barely.
Besides, who else would put up with you?

25:36.416 --> 25:39.250
-To women buying castles.

25:39.333 --> 25:41.166
To all of us.

25:41.250 --> 25:42.750
-Cheers!

25:42.833 --> 25:45.041
"Slainte" is what we say in Scotland.

25:45.125 --> 25:47.541
Slainte. Okay, here goes. Oh.

25:48.583 --> 25:50.000
-Mm.
-Oh!

25:50.083 --> 25:53.708
<i>Wait, wait. I thought you said</i>
<i>you were buying a castle.</i>

25:53.791 --> 25:55.000
I did.

25:55.083 --> 25:56.208
<i>Mom, are you drunk?</i>

25:56.291 --> 25:59.708
Oh! Not anymore. I'm buying Dun Dunbar.

26:00.291 --> 26:01.125
<i>Why?</i>

26:01.916 --> 26:03.500
Oh, I… I can't explain it.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.083
Um, except for the fact
that I think he would want me to.

26:08.166 --> 26:11.875
I can almost picture his face when I walk
through that door with the key.

26:11.958 --> 26:12.791
<i>Aw.</i>

26:12.875 --> 26:15.333
<i>I haven't seen you smile like this</i>
<i>in a really long time.</i>

26:15.916 --> 26:18.583
I know.
It's like it was meant to be.

26:19.166 --> 26:21.625
Although I have to live with him
till Christmas.

26:21.708 --> 26:23.250
<i>Him? Who's him?</i>

26:40.041 --> 26:42.000
Thank you, Eamon.

26:42.541 --> 26:44.708
-Oh, Hamish!

26:44.791 --> 26:46.250
Hi, big boy.

26:49.916 --> 26:51.291
Shall I announce you?

26:51.375 --> 26:52.958
-Really?
-Oh, aye.

26:54.416 --> 26:55.791
She's here!

27:08.666 --> 27:09.916
-Hello.
-Hello.

27:10.791 --> 27:13.583
Here. The key to my castle.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.083
Now you get the real tour.

27:17.166 --> 27:19.041
The £20 version wasn't real?

27:19.750 --> 27:21.250
Before we get started,

27:21.333 --> 27:25.041
you should know, here on the estate,
we have a community-owned wind farm

27:25.125 --> 27:27.416
where we create 70% of our energy.

27:27.916 --> 27:31.666
We also have sustainable forestry
and organic farming.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.541
I'm an environmental engineer.

27:34.625 --> 27:37.166
Four years at Oxford,
two years Cambridge.

27:40.416 --> 27:41.791
Oxford and Cambridge.

27:41.875 --> 27:42.791
Mm.

27:46.625 --> 27:49.250
Linen closet, water closet.

27:49.833 --> 27:52.291
-Maybe I need a map.
-Gift shop, £5.

27:52.375 --> 27:53.541
King James.

27:54.291 --> 27:58.666
And this here is Flemish, 16th century.

28:01.958 --> 28:03.875
And through here, my room.

28:06.083 --> 28:07.958
I will have no reason to go in there.

28:08.041 --> 28:09.791
We agree on that.

28:10.916 --> 28:13.958
More rooms. No power, leaky roof.

28:14.916 --> 28:16.958
This one's nice.

28:18.416 --> 28:21.791
The fifth duke died in here,
in that very bed.

28:22.791 --> 28:23.958
Horrible death.

28:24.458 --> 28:25.416
Ugh.

28:26.416 --> 28:29.000
There's a reason
they set horror movies in castles.

28:29.083 --> 28:33.583
It leaks after every rain,
and it rains 150 days a year.

28:34.250 --> 28:38.000
Plumbing's intermittent,
60 fireplaces half work,

28:38.583 --> 28:40.041
Wi-Fi is iffy,

28:40.541 --> 28:42.083
cell signal's worse.

28:42.916 --> 28:44.708
But there's running water?

28:44.791 --> 28:46.958
-Aye, it runs.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.375
Oh, by the way,
we don't heat the upstairs.

28:57.583 --> 28:58.666
Too costly.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.041
This way.

29:03.666 --> 29:05.750
So, you'll stay in this one.

29:07.666 --> 29:10.375
Are you sure the duke
didn't die in this room,

29:10.458 --> 29:12.208
and he's still in here somewhere?

29:12.291 --> 29:13.291
Oh!

29:13.375 --> 29:14.666
-Why?

29:14.750 --> 29:16.791
Is this room not up to your standards?

29:17.291 --> 29:18.208
Is there a closet?

29:18.291 --> 29:19.291
There's a chair.

29:19.958 --> 29:20.958
Bathroom?

29:21.041 --> 29:22.166
It's down the hall.

29:23.416 --> 29:25.041
Fireplace doesn't work though.

29:27.166 --> 29:28.041
I'll take it.

29:28.125 --> 29:28.958
Good.

29:30.166 --> 29:32.958
Oh, by the way, I looked up your family.

29:33.041 --> 29:35.708
There's no Brown in the records.

29:36.625 --> 29:39.458
-That's my married name.
-Oh, you're married, then?

29:39.541 --> 29:40.458
Divorced.

29:42.208 --> 29:43.916
Aye, now that I can believe.

29:47.625 --> 29:48.708
Leaving so soon?

29:49.416 --> 29:50.375
Follow me.

29:56.166 --> 29:57.375
Take a look at that.

30:00.916 --> 30:02.333
What is that?

30:02.416 --> 30:03.916
My father.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.708
"McGu" is your father's name?

30:06.833 --> 30:09.833
McGuinty.
He got caught before he could finish.

30:10.416 --> 30:13.916
Didn't think there was anything here
I hadn't seen. When was this?

30:14.875 --> 30:17.541
Sixty years ago. He was a kid.

30:17.625 --> 30:19.583
He snuck in and made it upstairs.

30:19.666 --> 30:22.208
He just wanted
someone to know he got inside.

30:23.000 --> 30:28.291
But some heartless stuffed shirt
tossed him out and fired his father.

30:29.291 --> 30:31.833
-Aye, that would've been my grandfather.
-Sorry.

30:31.916 --> 30:33.500
Nothing I haven't said myself.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.208
My old man wasn't much better.

30:38.208 --> 30:42.291
McGuinty, it's a strong name.
You should stick with that.

31:08.625 --> 31:10.166
Hamish.

31:12.083 --> 31:13.125
What do you want?

31:14.625 --> 31:17.041
-Should we go get a cup of tea?

31:17.541 --> 31:18.375
Okay.

31:19.916 --> 31:21.125
I'll follow you.

31:22.166 --> 31:23.000
Okay.

31:43.708 --> 31:44.625
Oh.

31:55.125 --> 31:56.166
We're lost, Hamish.

31:56.250 --> 31:58.833
All I want is a cup of tea.
Is that too much to ask?

32:07.875 --> 32:09.750
Oh. Uh, uh…

32:09.833 --> 32:12.541
I thought that… that this was the kitchen.

32:13.125 --> 32:16.291
As long as you're here,
do you mind pouring me another?

32:17.791 --> 32:18.833
Hm?

32:18.916 --> 32:22.083
-You could've locked the door.
-Why? It's my house.

32:22.166 --> 32:23.166
For now.

32:26.708 --> 32:28.125
Seriously?

32:31.333 --> 32:32.666
Thanks a lot, Hamish.

32:33.583 --> 32:35.875
<i>Be happy</i>
<i>that it was a quick death.</i>

32:35.958 --> 32:37.958
<i>I could have extended it for ten pages.</i>

32:38.041 --> 32:43.500
<i>I could have dragged him behind a car.</i>
<i>I could have poisoned him with mercury.</i>

32:43.583 --> 32:46.166
<i>I could have chopped him</i>
<i>into little, teeny pieces</i>

32:46.250 --> 32:47.750
<i>and fed him to the sharks!</i>

32:48.916 --> 32:49.750
Ooft.

33:28.750 --> 33:30.208
Where did you get that?

33:30.291 --> 33:31.208
Maisie.

33:32.791 --> 33:38.041
Page one. "Do you believe
in love at first sight? I didn't used to."

33:38.125 --> 33:39.375
"I'm Emma Gale."

33:39.458 --> 33:44.125
Now, where have I heard that before?
Oh, right. Your sales pitch.

33:44.208 --> 33:46.166
-I meant it.
-Did you now?

33:48.416 --> 33:51.416
"The first time I laid eyes on Winston,

33:52.125 --> 33:54.000
he felt like home."

33:55.916 --> 34:00.583
-Are you gonna read the whole thing to me?
-No, page one's good enough for me.

34:00.666 --> 34:02.125
May I have some coffee?

34:02.750 --> 34:03.750
Help yourself.

34:09.833 --> 34:12.125
If you are trying to discourage me,

34:12.208 --> 34:16.666
a cold room and a couple of bats
in the attic are not gonna do it.

34:17.166 --> 34:19.041
-Oh, aye?
-Mm.

34:19.125 --> 34:20.166
What will, then?

34:20.708 --> 34:21.541
Nothing.

34:22.958 --> 34:25.958
"'I will not be discouraged,' said Emma.
'I will get what I came for.'"

34:26.041 --> 34:28.833
Yeah, this is Pulitzer Prize stuff, this.

35:01.583 --> 35:02.500
Morning.

35:11.375 --> 35:14.500
Well, you remember what happened
when it was purple, don't you?

35:15.125 --> 35:16.750
That was a one-time thing.

35:18.375 --> 35:19.458
Hey. Hi.

35:19.541 --> 35:21.083
-Good morning.
-Morning.

35:21.166 --> 35:23.125
-What are you guys doing?
-Graffiti knitting.

35:23.208 --> 35:26.041
Yarn bombing. It's a thing.
Perks up the neighborhood.

35:26.958 --> 35:30.166
-How was your first night at the castle?
-Cold.

35:30.250 --> 35:31.875
Well, he'll warm up.

35:32.458 --> 35:33.291
The room.

35:34.750 --> 35:37.708
Well, you're just in time
to stop this massacre.

35:38.250 --> 35:41.041
Rhona wants to chop it off
and dye it green.

35:41.125 --> 35:44.000
Ooh. I really hope
we're talking about hair.

35:44.083 --> 35:46.125
I just need a change.

35:46.208 --> 35:47.416
Maybe I can help.

35:47.958 --> 35:52.458
I grew up over a barbershop
owned by the best scissor man in Queens,

35:52.541 --> 35:55.166
and an expert colorist. Let's do it.

35:55.875 --> 35:57.083
Whoo!

35:57.666 --> 36:00.333
-So, I think a bit of color.
-Okay, all right.

36:00.958 --> 36:02.416
-Helen?
<i>-Hello.</i>

36:02.500 --> 36:04.583
Hi. Yeah, I'm gonna need your help.

36:04.666 --> 36:06.250
-<i>Okay.</i>
At the castle.

36:10.291 --> 36:11.625
Whoo!

36:11.708 --> 36:14.583
-Does she know we're coming?
-I just texted her.

36:14.666 --> 36:15.791
Great.

36:17.166 --> 36:18.750
Oh, that is perfect.

36:18.833 --> 36:20.625
Come on, then, slow coaches.

36:20.708 --> 36:23.166
That will be lovely
up there in that room.

36:24.041 --> 36:27.500
Ah, yeah, we're right behind you,
Speedy Gonzales. I see you running off.

36:27.583 --> 36:30.166
Dinna hang back.
Knitters to the rescue.

36:38.416 --> 36:42.625
-I've never been up the stairs before.
-Well, it's clear you haven't missed much.

36:44.458 --> 36:45.791
This is perfect.

36:45.875 --> 36:49.541
-Not as perfect as my hair.
-I have to admit, it does suit you.

36:49.625 --> 36:54.041
Well, this is looking rather nice.

36:54.125 --> 36:55.000
Is it?

36:55.750 --> 36:58.333
Where's the Scotch dresser? And the lamps?

36:58.416 --> 37:00.416
-I haven't the slightest.
-Hm.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.250
Maybe your memory's fading.

37:02.333 --> 37:04.583
No. I remember everything.

37:10.291 --> 37:13.583
-Okay, what's with you two?
-Nothing.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.666
Oh, that's been going on forever.

37:16.708 --> 37:17.541
And?

37:18.750 --> 37:22.458
Maybe we dated for a bit
before I married Sean.

37:22.541 --> 37:25.041
Well, you're not married now, are you?

37:25.125 --> 37:26.125
Psh!

37:27.000 --> 37:27.916
Thank you.

37:28.916 --> 37:31.083
Oh, I don't know how to thank you.

37:31.166 --> 37:34.208
Not necessary.
We knitters look after each other.

37:34.291 --> 37:37.041
No one crosses the knitters. Right, Angus?

37:40.375 --> 37:43.500
You know, I've known Myles my whole life.

37:43.583 --> 37:47.000
After you get past that upper crust,
he's got a good heart.

37:47.083 --> 37:49.791
-It might be hard to see right now.

37:51.208 --> 37:54.375
You couldn't find a better landlord.
That's for certain.

37:54.458 --> 37:55.416
Landlord?

37:55.958 --> 37:59.583
My family has been tenants
on the Dunbar land for generations.

37:59.666 --> 38:00.791
Mine too.

38:03.708 --> 38:06.250
The 11th duke squandered
what remained of the family money,

38:06.333 --> 38:08.791
left Myles with an empty title,

38:08.875 --> 38:12.041
a mountain of debt,
and the whole village counting on him.

38:12.875 --> 38:13.958
The whole village?

38:14.458 --> 38:16.791
It's the reason he's selling the castle.

38:16.875 --> 38:19.666
So he can pay off
the debt on the farmlands.

38:19.750 --> 38:22.375
That way, whatever happens,

38:22.458 --> 38:24.375
we'll all have a place to live. Hm.

38:24.458 --> 38:26.458
Hm. Except him.

38:35.250 --> 38:37.916
Come after finals.
We can have Christmas here.

38:38.541 --> 38:39.416
<i>Oh.</i>

38:40.000 --> 38:42.458
<i>Mom, Dad didn't tell you.</i>

38:42.541 --> 38:43.916
Dad didn't tell me what?

38:44.000 --> 38:47.625
He's marrying what's-her-name
on Christmas.

38:50.916 --> 38:52.416
Well, good for them.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.833
<i>I… I told him I'd go,</i>
<i>but I really don't have to.</i>

38:54.916 --> 38:56.541
Honey, you have to go.

38:58.125 --> 38:58.958
<i>Is that him?</i>

38:59.041 --> 39:01.250
Oh. Myles?

39:01.333 --> 39:02.375
Mm?

39:03.875 --> 39:05.500
This is my daughter, Lexi.

39:06.291 --> 39:07.875
Oh, uh, nice to meet you.

39:07.958 --> 39:08.958
<i>You too.</i>

39:10.875 --> 39:11.875
<i>Wow.</i>

39:11.958 --> 39:13.333
I'll call you later.

39:15.125 --> 39:16.875
Oh.

39:16.958 --> 39:18.000
Thank you.

39:18.625 --> 39:19.750
It's not for you.

39:20.250 --> 39:22.833
The damp air degrades the books.

39:22.916 --> 39:25.208
The knitters told me some things.

39:25.291 --> 39:27.750
I think maybe my first impression of you
was wrong.

39:27.833 --> 39:31.750
I doubt it. So, who's what's-her-name?

39:32.833 --> 39:35.625
-So you were listening?
-I may have heard a word or two.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.791
The woman
for whom my husband left me.

39:39.875 --> 39:41.250
Well, you're better off, then.

39:41.875 --> 39:43.916
Obviously, he's an eejit.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.083
That actually sounded like a compliment.

39:46.583 --> 39:48.375
It's more of an insult to him.

39:48.875 --> 39:50.000
Well, I'll take it.

39:51.083 --> 39:54.333
If I'm being honest,
it wasn't all his fault.

39:55.458 --> 39:58.416
I've spent most of the last decade
on my computer.

40:00.500 --> 40:03.625
I was married once.
A long time ago.

40:04.333 --> 40:06.708
She left me
for someone with a bigger title.

40:07.333 --> 40:08.333
A title climber.

40:08.416 --> 40:10.166
Aye, pretty much.

40:11.250 --> 40:12.958
I thought we were happy.

40:13.458 --> 40:14.833
At least I was.

40:16.166 --> 40:21.833
When she left me, I came back here
to put myself back together.

40:24.083 --> 40:26.500
Dun Dunbar's been my life ever since.

40:31.833 --> 40:33.250
Oh, what am I saying?

40:33.333 --> 40:36.291
I sound like
a character from one of your books.

40:36.375 --> 40:40.583
-So you're reading my books?
-Point is, people leave, we survive.

40:43.541 --> 40:47.208
I guess I just never thought
I'd be alone at this stage of my life.

40:47.708 --> 40:49.208
You're not alone.

40:49.291 --> 40:50.375
You've got Hamish.

40:52.500 --> 40:53.333
Come on, then.

40:53.833 --> 40:56.875
-What?
-You're clearly not writing anything.

41:07.375 --> 41:09.666
Oh, look at the hairy coos.

41:09.750 --> 41:11.833
-Morning rush hour.

41:20.500 --> 41:21.375
Sheep.

41:21.875 --> 41:24.208
You might know them as expensive sweaters.

41:24.291 --> 41:26.916
Really?
You mean like the one you're wearing?

41:44.000 --> 41:45.458
That one's for sale too.

41:47.208 --> 41:50.750
-Ocean view from every room.
-Central air conditioning.

41:50.833 --> 41:53.208
And it comes with its own graveyard.

41:53.291 --> 41:54.708
That's a selling point.

41:54.791 --> 41:57.625
Exactly. You never have to leave.

42:05.916 --> 42:08.500
There's one more place
I'd like to show you.

42:15.791 --> 42:17.666
-Mind your step.

42:20.541 --> 42:23.625
So, this is Dun Glen Holy Well.

42:23.708 --> 42:24.666
Watch your head.

42:25.958 --> 42:27.000
Mm.

42:28.208 --> 42:29.250
What are all these?

42:29.333 --> 42:30.666
Locals leave them.

42:30.750 --> 42:33.333
Legend dates back
to the first Duchess of Dunbar.

42:33.416 --> 42:36.791
When war broke out,
she donned the garments of a warrior,

42:37.375 --> 42:41.583
came to this very well, and laid
a necklace on the edge for courage.

42:42.583 --> 42:43.500
What happened?

42:44.041 --> 42:45.416
Well, she went off to fight.

42:45.500 --> 42:47.750
Turned out she had the heart of a warrior.

42:49.041 --> 42:50.458
She ended up saving the village

42:50.541 --> 42:54.083
and falling in love
with a man who fought by her side.

42:54.166 --> 42:55.250
A commoner.

42:55.333 --> 42:56.458
That's beautiful.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Aye. If you like that sort of tale.

42:59.500 --> 43:01.000
Did they end up together?

43:02.166 --> 43:04.750
Wed on Christmas Eve at Dun Dunbar.

43:06.125 --> 43:07.708
Invited the whole village.

43:08.458 --> 43:11.916
And every Christmas Eve after that,
for a century or two anyway.

43:12.958 --> 43:15.916
Christmas Eve at Dun Dunbar
for the village.

43:17.208 --> 43:18.500
We should do that.

43:18.583 --> 43:19.416
We?

43:19.500 --> 43:20.583
Whoever owns it.

43:23.166 --> 43:24.583
Aye, we'll see.

43:26.500 --> 43:27.666
Okay…

43:27.750 --> 43:29.083
…that's the end of the tour.

43:30.333 --> 43:32.000
How about we end it at the pub?

43:38.625 --> 43:39.750
You know,

43:40.791 --> 43:43.250
I dinna really hang out there
all that much.

43:43.333 --> 43:45.291
Mm. We'll see.

44:00.208 --> 44:01.958
-Hi.
-Hey.

44:08.791 --> 44:10.083
There he is.

44:12.083 --> 44:14.291
-Everybody's here.
-Oh!

44:19.583 --> 44:21.208
-Mm.
-No.

44:21.291 --> 44:23.750
-Oh, come on.
-No, no, no, I don't wanna.

44:23.833 --> 44:26.375
-What's the matter with you, man?
-No, I cannot sing.

44:26.458 --> 44:29.916
Course you can sing.
Anyone can sing. Here we go. Come on.

45:22.500 --> 45:23.416
Go on, then.

45:35.166 --> 45:36.000
Come on!

45:37.041 --> 45:38.041
Go on!

45:56.166 --> 45:58.708
-Oh, this was unexpected.
-Aye.

45:58.791 --> 45:59.708
Thank you.

46:07.541 --> 46:08.583
You're welcome.

46:12.416 --> 46:13.333
I mean,

46:15.041 --> 46:18.750
it's… it's not like
this was a date or anything, right?

46:21.708 --> 46:23.125
-Of course not.
-No.

46:24.541 --> 46:25.458
Hm.

46:28.958 --> 46:30.083
Handshake?

46:30.750 --> 46:31.583
Why not?

46:46.875 --> 46:48.291
-Good night.
-Good night.

46:53.291 --> 46:54.708
And this wasn't a date.

46:57.250 --> 46:58.125
Duly noted.

47:00.541 --> 47:01.541
Come on, Hamish.

47:02.125 --> 47:02.958
Come on.

47:03.041 --> 47:03.875
Hamish!

47:05.375 --> 47:06.208
Wee traitor.

47:38.500 --> 47:40.208
<i>Well, it's been a month now,</i>

47:40.291 --> 47:42.375
and she's still here.

47:42.875 --> 47:44.541
Thirty-two days, actually.

47:45.166 --> 47:47.625
It appears you're warming up to her.

47:47.708 --> 47:49.916
Just keeping my enemies closer.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.208
Ah.

47:51.833 --> 47:53.416
-Hey, Thomas.
-Aye?

47:53.500 --> 47:54.416
Come here.

47:56.458 --> 47:58.250
-What?
-Tell me something.

47:59.166 --> 48:01.916
-Am I starting to look like them?
-No comment.

48:04.916 --> 48:06.250
-No, that's worse.
-No?

48:06.333 --> 48:10.375
No. Look, you've spent your whole life
trying not to be them.

48:11.250 --> 48:12.375
So don't be.

48:13.333 --> 48:14.250
Meaning?

48:16.208 --> 48:18.458
You've been alone a long time
in this castle.

48:18.541 --> 48:20.250
-I'm not alone. I've got you.
-Aye.

48:21.083 --> 48:22.791
And here the two of us are,

48:23.666 --> 48:27.166
standing around looking at old paintings
of people we hated.

48:32.916 --> 48:35.083
<i>"The wind was speaking to her."</i>

48:36.250 --> 48:37.291
Eh.

48:37.375 --> 48:38.541
<i>Come on, wind.</i>

48:39.500 --> 48:42.041
<i>"The well was speaking to her."</i>

48:42.791 --> 48:44.916
<i>What the heck</i>
<i>was the well saying?</i>

48:46.333 --> 48:49.250
<i>"The well whispered a story</i>
<i>to her longing heart."</i>

48:50.125 --> 48:51.916
-Mm-mm.

48:58.291 --> 49:00.916
-Hello.
-Tell me you've at least started.

49:02.041 --> 49:03.583
I have started.

49:03.666 --> 49:05.625
What is the plan here?

49:05.708 --> 49:07.833
I don't have an exact plan.

49:08.375 --> 49:10.458
-Just come home.
-I can't.

49:10.541 --> 49:13.666
You can't just run off to Scotland
and hide out in a castle.

49:13.750 --> 49:14.833
Why not?

49:14.916 --> 49:17.916
I'm not going to tell you that
your life depends on writing this book.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.166
-Oh, gee, thanks.
-But your career does.

49:21.250 --> 49:25.166
And I know you, Sophie.
You have worked your whole life for this.

49:25.250 --> 49:27.083
What are you without it?

49:30.958 --> 49:32.458
-I don't know.

49:32.541 --> 49:34.666
Very good, everyone. Follow me.

49:34.750 --> 49:35.708
I'll call you later.

49:35.791 --> 49:40.750
And this is where the third duchess
would retire… Ay, oh.

49:40.833 --> 49:42.416
Sorry.

49:42.500 --> 49:43.375
Don't mind me.

49:43.458 --> 49:45.583
Oh my God, that's Sophie Brown!

49:46.375 --> 49:49.041
Everybody,
if we could, um, just move on.

49:49.125 --> 49:52.166
I've read all your books.
Could I have a selfie?

49:52.250 --> 49:54.416
-Oh.
-Of course.

49:58.583 --> 50:02.916
Right. All right, then.
No, let's continue on. That's very good.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.250
Uh…

50:04.333 --> 50:08.041
You know what, Thomas?
I have an idea. Why don't I give the tour?

50:08.125 --> 50:10.708
Yes! Please!

50:11.333 --> 50:13.250
Well, why not indeed?

50:13.791 --> 50:14.750
Thank you.

50:15.500 --> 50:19.625
William Wallace,
the very mason who built Edinburgh Castle,

50:20.125 --> 50:23.916
put these in himself,
and they are filled with legends.

50:27.125 --> 50:29.708
So, in 1745,

50:29.791 --> 50:33.166
the sixth Duke of Dunbar
barricaded the old castle walls

50:33.250 --> 50:36.333
and stood against the British army
for three weeks.

50:37.208 --> 50:41.458
It was 1746. Fifth duke.
Castle held for four weeks.

50:42.208 --> 50:44.125
And over there,

50:44.958 --> 50:47.375
it looks like a duke.

50:47.458 --> 50:49.250
-Walks like a duke.

50:49.333 --> 50:52.291
It is a duke!

50:57.541 --> 50:59.958
It's been an absolute pleasure.

51:01.375 --> 51:03.833
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.
Glad to hear it.

51:03.916 --> 51:05.166
Don't be strangers.

51:06.583 --> 51:09.541
Well, it looks like
we're gonna have to reorder.

51:10.208 --> 51:12.083
Maybe stock some of your books.

51:12.166 --> 51:15.500
-Oh, I wouldn't go that far.
-Hey, well done.

51:16.750 --> 51:17.833
Thank you, Thomas.

51:19.916 --> 51:20.750
Hello.

51:24.458 --> 51:27.500
Well, she's good for business.

51:29.541 --> 51:33.041
You know, it wouldna be the worst thing
to let someone in again.

51:33.833 --> 51:34.708
Let her in?

51:35.583 --> 51:38.500
I'm trying to get rid of her,
you divvy, or have you forgotten?

51:42.541 --> 51:43.875
What's all this?

51:43.958 --> 51:45.791
They're here to collect Sophie.

51:46.458 --> 51:47.333
Great.

51:50.625 --> 51:51.958
-Hello.
-Maisie.

51:52.041 --> 51:53.541
You look different.

51:54.166 --> 51:55.166
Quite lovely.

51:55.958 --> 51:56.791
Thank you.

51:57.375 --> 51:58.375
It's all Sophie.

51:58.458 --> 51:59.333
Sophie?

51:59.416 --> 52:00.833
No, she did my hair.

52:00.916 --> 52:02.166
And mine.

52:07.125 --> 52:09.000
-She did everyone's hair?
-Uh-huh.

52:09.916 --> 52:10.875
She's not doing mine.

52:13.041 --> 52:15.875
-Oh! I'm sorry I'm late.
-Oh, no bother.

52:15.958 --> 52:17.833
Come on. Get in. It's nice and toasty.

52:17.916 --> 52:19.250
-Hi.
-Come on.

52:19.333 --> 52:20.416
Hello, Angus.

52:20.500 --> 52:22.291
-That's it.

52:23.291 --> 52:24.416
Let's get going.

52:24.500 --> 52:26.833
-How are you getting on?
-All right. So…

52:43.958 --> 52:46.916
Whiskey, and leave the bottle.

52:51.958 --> 52:53.583
So you're a regular now?

52:54.125 --> 52:54.958
Very funny.

52:55.833 --> 52:57.500
Maybe he wants to learn how to knit.

53:00.041 --> 53:02.625
I tried to teach him
when he was wee.

53:07.916 --> 53:08.916
No looking.

53:15.875 --> 53:16.958
Ooh.

53:20.500 --> 53:22.666
Uh, mind my wall, fella.

53:28.083 --> 53:29.333
We need to talk.

53:29.416 --> 53:30.333
About what?

53:30.416 --> 53:31.291
Outside.

53:35.625 --> 53:38.583
I'm trying to be
accommodating here, but, um,

53:39.875 --> 53:42.958
this whole thing, it's not working for me.

53:43.041 --> 53:43.958
What thing?

53:44.041 --> 53:45.666
-You.
-Oh.

53:45.750 --> 53:49.250
You're just…
You're too much. You're everywhere.

53:49.333 --> 53:52.791
The redecorating,
the gift shop, the tours.

53:52.875 --> 53:54.708
You stole my dog. The knitting!

53:55.500 --> 53:57.875
I mean, what's next?
You're gonna run for mayor?

53:59.250 --> 54:00.833
Is there an election?

54:02.625 --> 54:04.041
This was not part of our deal.

54:04.125 --> 54:05.041
-Our deal?
-Aye.

54:05.125 --> 54:07.833
The one where you drive me out,
and I forfeit my overpriced deposit?

54:09.708 --> 54:12.500
I may not have gone
to Oxford or Cambridge,

54:13.333 --> 54:15.916
but I know how to read a contract.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.875
No one in their right mind
would have signed that, but I did.

54:19.375 --> 54:21.250
Because I am staying through escrow,

54:21.333 --> 54:23.625
I will be here
on Christmas and New Year's.

54:23.708 --> 54:25.250
-In fact, I may never leave.
-Mm.

54:25.333 --> 54:26.875
Maybe this is my next chapter.

54:26.958 --> 54:27.916
I don't know.

54:29.083 --> 54:30.375
I don't know anything.

54:32.083 --> 54:33.041
And it's scary.

54:37.750 --> 54:39.416
Guess I settled that, didn't I?

54:41.250 --> 54:42.416
Just keep knitting.

54:47.416 --> 54:49.458
Come on, Hamish. Good boy.

54:59.083 --> 55:00.125
What are you doing?

55:00.708 --> 55:03.875
-I don't like unfinished business.
-Oh, of course.

55:03.958 --> 55:06.166
You're getting rid of my father's name.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.083
-Thank you.
-It's not for you.

55:15.666 --> 55:18.291
He worked here. He's part of the history.

55:19.500 --> 55:21.583
-This your way of apologizing?
-It is not.

55:21.666 --> 55:23.166
I accept.

55:23.250 --> 55:24.750
I am not apologizing.

55:24.833 --> 55:25.875
And I accept.

55:35.083 --> 55:38.416
<i>"The well whispered a story</i>
<i>to the wind about a woman."</i>

55:39.416 --> 55:41.125
<i>Bloody hell, that's terrible.</i>

55:44.208 --> 55:45.833
<i>Warrior woman, speak to me!</i>

55:47.166 --> 55:51.541
<i>It's a week before Christmas.</i>
<i>I need to at least write the first page.</i>

55:52.166 --> 55:53.125
<i>Ugh!</i>

55:54.458 --> 55:57.083
<i>Come on, warrior woman.</i>
<i>Come on. Speak to me.</i>

55:57.791 --> 55:59.250
<i>Please say something.</i>

56:02.125 --> 56:03.208
Come in.

56:05.583 --> 56:07.750
Just gonna sit there,
or you gonna help me move it in?

56:10.041 --> 56:12.291
I brought you a Scotch dresser.

56:17.625 --> 56:18.958
You got this for me?

56:19.625 --> 56:22.125
Aye. Found it in the attic.

56:22.208 --> 56:25.041
-Oh.
-Just, uh, touched it up a bit.

56:25.916 --> 56:28.625
Well, it's beautiful.

56:30.041 --> 56:31.541
How's, uh, Emma Gale?

56:31.625 --> 56:35.291
-Emma Gale and I have parted ways.
-Oh?

56:35.375 --> 56:38.500
There's actually another story
that I would like to tell.

56:38.583 --> 56:40.333
Oh, aye? What kind of story?

56:40.416 --> 56:41.541
It's about a woman,

56:42.083 --> 56:44.083
a well, and a sword.

56:45.375 --> 56:46.833
So she's doing the killing?

56:46.916 --> 56:49.583
-She's saving a village.
-From what?

56:49.666 --> 56:50.916
You're gonna have to read it.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.416
Send me a copy
when you're back in New York.

56:53.916 --> 56:55.416
Give me a forwarding address.

57:00.166 --> 57:01.000
Thank you.

57:01.500 --> 57:02.916
I love it, Myles.

57:04.083 --> 57:05.000
I'm glad.

57:07.041 --> 57:08.125
Myles?

57:09.208 --> 57:10.791
There is something we need to talk about.

57:12.375 --> 57:13.541
A Christmas tree

57:14.416 --> 57:15.750
for the ballroom.

57:49.375 --> 57:52.583
So, what do you usually do at Christmas?

57:53.333 --> 57:54.166
This.

57:57.250 --> 57:58.083
Actually,

57:59.250 --> 58:02.375
this is the first Christmas
I'll be without Lexi.

58:03.208 --> 58:05.333
Well, why don't you invite her, then?

58:06.666 --> 58:07.750
She's got a wedding.

58:08.333 --> 58:09.500
Oh, right.

58:10.375 --> 58:12.208
The eejit and what's-her-name.

58:12.791 --> 58:15.750
Okay, so "eejit" is "idiot."

58:15.833 --> 58:16.666
Aye.

58:16.750 --> 58:18.500
-"Diddy" is "idiot." What's "dobber"?
-Aye.

58:18.583 --> 58:19.541
Spineless idiot.

58:19.625 --> 58:20.541
"Numpty"?

58:20.625 --> 58:21.500
Useless idiot.

58:22.083 --> 58:22.916
Okay.

58:23.708 --> 58:24.958
"Walloper"?

58:25.041 --> 58:27.666
Aye, that's more of a moron.

58:27.750 --> 58:29.541
Got it.

58:31.416 --> 58:32.625
What about this one?

58:33.583 --> 58:34.958
Aye. That's a fine one.

58:41.583 --> 58:42.708
What are you doing?

58:44.500 --> 58:46.750
Every time we cut down a tree,

58:48.083 --> 58:50.208
we plant two in its place.

58:50.833 --> 58:51.833
Oh.

58:52.583 --> 58:53.708
That's lovely.

58:54.666 --> 58:57.250
I always try to leave things
better than I found them.

59:07.958 --> 59:12.791
-Aye.
-Announcing the knitters of Dunbar.

59:13.416 --> 59:14.375
Oh!

59:14.458 --> 59:16.583
It's a little early for a party, isn't it?

59:16.666 --> 59:19.791
Well, there will not be any party
without their help.

59:19.875 --> 59:23.125
Or my yule cakes.
I'm baking for Dun Dunbar!

59:23.208 --> 59:24.458
It's stunning.

59:24.541 --> 59:26.333
-Oh, Your Grace.
-Aye?

59:26.416 --> 59:29.791
I can't tell you how much it means
to everyone in the village,

59:29.875 --> 59:32.041
celebrating at the castle.

59:32.125 --> 59:36.208
Well, I… I wish I could take the credit,
but it's all her.

59:36.291 --> 59:37.958
Actually, it's us.

59:38.625 --> 59:40.000
Not that there is an us.

59:40.083 --> 59:41.500
No, no.

59:41.583 --> 59:42.708
Uh, excuse me.

59:44.875 --> 59:45.958
Here you go.

59:46.041 --> 59:48.958
Don't worry about him.
He'll just get in the way.

59:51.708 --> 59:53.416
This one's nice, isn't it?

59:54.625 --> 59:57.791
I suppose it's about time
these things saw the light of day again.

59:57.875 --> 59:59.916
I cannot believe this.

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:03.750
Hey. You remember this?
Your three-legged cow.

1:00:03.833 --> 1:00:06.208
Three legs is better
than whatever this was.

1:00:06.291 --> 1:00:08.416
-Hey, don't make fun of my sheep!

1:00:08.500 --> 1:00:10.583
-I worked hard on that.
-I know. I remember!

1:00:11.458 --> 1:00:15.666
This one cut right in the back
of his father's favorite chair.

1:00:16.333 --> 1:00:19.583
Then we had to go hide it in the stables!
Remember?

1:00:24.541 --> 1:00:27.958
Uh, knitters, shall we?

1:00:47.750 --> 1:00:48.916
Ha, ha, ha.

1:01:02.125 --> 1:01:02.958
Hey, come on.

1:01:14.125 --> 1:01:15.833
I tell you…

1:01:16.958 --> 1:01:18.333
-Shush, you.
-Anyway, I was…

1:01:18.416 --> 1:01:20.958
-Don't. 'Cause I was going to say…
-Mm-hmm.

1:01:21.041 --> 1:01:23.333
-…that I've got three-- Oh. Sorry.

1:01:23.958 --> 1:01:26.208
<i>-Buongiorno. </i>Yes.
-May I help you?

1:01:26.291 --> 1:01:29.541
Yes. I would like a room
for the night, please.

1:01:29.625 --> 1:01:33.333
Okay. All we've got left
is the Christmas Romance package.

1:01:33.416 --> 1:01:34.375
Oh.

1:01:34.458 --> 1:01:35.791
-Champagne in the evening.
-Really?

1:01:35.875 --> 1:01:36.916
-Breakfast in bed.
-Hm.

1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:38.416
All the Netflix you can binge.

1:01:38.500 --> 1:01:40.500
Thank you. We'll take that.

1:01:41.416 --> 1:01:42.916
-Yes, we will.
-Very good.

1:01:43.500 --> 1:01:45.958
-Can I take your name, please?
-Donatelli.

1:01:46.041 --> 1:01:47.000
Excellent.

1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:49.833
Maybe you're right about this party.

1:01:51.208 --> 1:01:52.750
Did you just say I was right?

1:01:53.541 --> 1:01:54.375
I said maybe.

1:01:58.875 --> 1:02:00.500
I should probably tell you,

1:02:01.458 --> 1:02:04.375
that bedroom you liked,
where the fifth duke died,

1:02:04.458 --> 1:02:05.625
I made that up.

1:02:07.375 --> 1:02:09.375
Just wanted you to have the worst room.

1:02:10.333 --> 1:02:13.750
I know. The fifth duke
died in the Battle of Culloden.

1:02:14.333 --> 1:02:15.916
The sixth was thrown from a horse,

1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:20.250
and the 11th, your father,
died alone in a hotel room in London.

1:02:20.333 --> 1:02:21.291
Aye.

1:02:25.750 --> 1:02:27.333
Ugh! Not again.

1:02:28.791 --> 1:02:29.625
Excuse me.

1:02:32.541 --> 1:02:34.666
I suppose you know
how I'm going to die too?

1:02:34.750 --> 1:02:36.291
I could come up with a few ideas.

1:02:37.791 --> 1:02:39.750
-Electrocution.

1:02:40.375 --> 1:02:41.750
Not mercury poisoning?

1:02:41.833 --> 1:02:43.125
Or being fed to sharks?

1:02:43.208 --> 1:02:44.625
Well…

1:02:47.291 --> 1:02:49.458
I'm sure those could be arranged too.

1:02:52.708 --> 1:02:55.166
It's probably all those Christmas lights
you made us put up.

1:02:55.250 --> 1:02:57.166
Oh, sure, blame Christmas.

1:02:58.458 --> 1:03:00.166
I would never do that.

1:03:00.250 --> 1:03:01.416
I'm blaming you.

1:03:01.500 --> 1:03:03.666
I think you might be needing these.

1:03:04.250 --> 1:03:06.750
Judging by your last foray
into the electrical problems,

1:03:06.833 --> 1:03:09.125
it's going to be a long, dark night.

1:03:11.875 --> 1:03:13.333
Thank you, Thomas.

1:03:14.750 --> 1:03:16.875
I do feel good about this.

1:03:18.125 --> 1:03:20.750
I feel comfortable with it.

1:03:20.833 --> 1:03:23.500
<i>I told you,</i>
<i>your fans don't want something else.</i>

1:03:23.583 --> 1:03:25.041
<i>They want Emma Gale.</i>

1:03:25.125 --> 1:03:27.958
<i>Harper's is talking</i>
<i>an additional four-book deal.</i>

1:03:28.041 --> 1:03:28.916
Claire--

1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:32.541
<i>You'll do the morning shows,</i>
<i>tease the new Emma.</i>

1:03:32.625 --> 1:03:33.958
Emma Gale isn't real.

1:03:34.583 --> 1:03:36.708
I am. Sophie Brown.

1:03:37.375 --> 1:03:39.041
Maybe not even Sophie Brown.

1:03:39.625 --> 1:03:40.666
Sophie McGuinty.

1:03:40.750 --> 1:03:42.166
<i>Sophie McGuinty.</i>

1:03:42.833 --> 1:03:45.375
<i>-Who is that?</i>
-I'll let you know when I figure it out.

1:03:45.458 --> 1:03:47.416
<i>Well, she better know how to write.</i>

1:03:48.583 --> 1:03:51.083
<i>What's with all the candlelight?</i>
<i>Did you go back in time?</i>

1:03:52.916 --> 1:03:54.916
He fixed it.

1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:59.041
<i>Oh my God.</i>
<i>You are never coming home, are you?</i>

1:03:59.125 --> 1:04:02.416
<i>You are falling for this guy.</i>
<i>The… the earl!</i>

1:04:02.500 --> 1:04:03.333
Duke.

1:04:03.416 --> 1:04:06.166
<i>You know, I can work with this.</i>

1:04:06.791 --> 1:04:10.000
<i>You become a duchess,</i>
<i>and we can rebrand you.</i>

1:04:10.083 --> 1:04:12.500
<i>No one is even gonna remember this fiasco.</i>

1:04:12.583 --> 1:04:15.000
<i>This… This is genius.</i>

1:04:16.333 --> 1:04:17.625
<i>Close the deal.</i>

1:04:17.708 --> 1:04:18.625
Goodbye.

1:04:21.291 --> 1:04:24.750
Well, tomorrow's Christmas Eve.

1:04:24.833 --> 1:04:25.791
I'm aware.

1:04:25.875 --> 1:04:28.666
And Christmas the following day.

1:04:28.750 --> 1:04:31.041
That's generally how it works.

1:04:31.125 --> 1:04:34.708
Can't you just admit
you have feelings for her, eh?

1:04:34.791 --> 1:04:38.583
And even if I do,
what difference would it make?

1:04:38.666 --> 1:04:40.083
She's here to ruin me.

1:04:40.166 --> 1:04:41.375
-Ruin you?
-Aye.

1:04:41.458 --> 1:04:44.125
This is the happiest
I have seen you in years.

1:04:44.208 --> 1:04:46.208
-Oh, what do you know?
-Everything.

1:04:49.583 --> 1:04:51.583
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

1:04:51.666 --> 1:04:54.375
I am sorry I am late.

1:04:55.625 --> 1:04:59.041
But I need a group opinion on this dress.

1:05:02.125 --> 1:05:05.125
I found it in bedroom nine.

1:05:05.833 --> 1:05:06.875
Too much?

1:05:06.958 --> 1:05:08.500
It's totally too much.

1:05:08.583 --> 1:05:09.875
You have to wear it.

1:05:10.375 --> 1:05:12.250
It's gorgeous.

1:05:12.916 --> 1:05:15.625
I don't even know if it fits.

1:05:15.708 --> 1:05:17.000
I can alter it.

1:05:17.500 --> 1:05:20.041
Okay. Um, all right.

1:05:20.125 --> 1:05:22.416
So now I have something

1:05:23.291 --> 1:05:24.500
for all of you.

1:05:24.583 --> 1:05:28.041
I… I don't think we should be wearing
Dun Dunbar dresses to the party.

1:05:28.125 --> 1:05:30.291
Not Dun Dunbar. Saks Fifth Avenue.

1:05:33.458 --> 1:05:34.375
Thank you.

1:05:34.458 --> 1:05:36.583
-And for you, sir.
-Thanks.

1:05:36.666 --> 1:05:39.166
Beautiful! Thank you!

1:05:39.791 --> 1:05:42.958
Rhona, that's gorgeous.

1:05:43.041 --> 1:05:45.458
-That's lovely. Oh, thank you.
-Thank you.

1:05:46.083 --> 1:05:48.125
Matches your hair. 

1:05:50.208 --> 1:05:52.875
He'll take a second notion to me
when I wear this.

1:05:57.791 --> 1:05:59.708
What do you think? Is it me?

1:06:00.750 --> 1:06:01.958
It is, isn't it?

1:06:04.916 --> 1:06:06.791
Hamish! Hamish!

1:06:08.041 --> 1:06:10.416
Hamish! Hamish! Hamish!

1:06:11.208 --> 1:06:12.291
Hamish!

1:06:12.375 --> 1:06:14.000
Hamish, here, give me that.

1:06:15.708 --> 1:06:17.041
Don't. Give it to me.

1:06:18.916 --> 1:06:21.958
-Give. Give it to me!

1:06:24.291 --> 1:06:25.875
-What are you doing?

1:06:27.583 --> 1:06:29.041
-I'm sorry.

1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:35.083
I found this. I thought…
maybe I could wear it tomorrow night.

1:06:35.916 --> 1:06:39.291
Unless it belonged to your mother
or your grandmother.

1:06:39.375 --> 1:06:41.166
You shouldn't be wearing that.

1:06:41.708 --> 1:06:43.833
You're mad at me over a dress?

1:06:45.041 --> 1:06:46.458
No. No.

1:06:49.791 --> 1:06:51.208
I'm mad at myself.

1:06:53.541 --> 1:06:54.375
Why?

1:07:13.958 --> 1:07:15.416
I'm mad at myself too.

1:07:28.708 --> 1:07:31.875
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

1:07:32.375 --> 1:07:33.291
We, uh,

1:07:34.250 --> 1:07:35.875
we shouldn't be doing this.

1:07:36.750 --> 1:07:37.583
No.

1:07:39.125 --> 1:07:39.958
No.

1:07:40.583 --> 1:07:42.916
We definitely should not be doing this.

1:08:04.625 --> 1:08:06.083
Merry Christmas, Angus.

1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.000
-Good morning.
-Yeah.

1:08:24.083 --> 1:08:25.958
And Merry Christmas Eve.

1:08:26.041 --> 1:08:28.250
Is there anything
I can do to help?

1:08:28.333 --> 1:08:32.166
Absolutely nothing. This is my domain.

1:08:32.250 --> 1:08:33.125
Okay.

1:08:34.208 --> 1:08:35.541
-Oh.

1:08:36.083 --> 1:08:37.875
Oh, how lovely.

1:08:37.958 --> 1:08:39.833
-Thank you, Thomas.

1:08:40.750 --> 1:08:41.625
Good morning.

1:08:43.541 --> 1:08:44.375
Good morning.

1:08:45.250 --> 1:08:46.291
What's all this?

1:08:47.250 --> 1:08:49.500
What does it look like? Breakfast.

1:08:49.583 --> 1:08:53.125
-How very thoughtful of you.
-Well, I am nothing if not that.

1:09:05.291 --> 1:09:06.916
Ladies first.

1:09:07.958 --> 1:09:08.791
Thank you.

1:09:24.541 --> 1:09:26.375
Is there something else?

1:09:26.458 --> 1:09:27.583
Uh, no, no, no.

1:09:27.666 --> 1:09:29.750
That, uh, that about covers it.

1:09:31.625 --> 1:09:32.833
Angus, come on.

1:09:34.166 --> 1:09:36.666
Let's leave these two lovebirds alone.

1:09:40.541 --> 1:09:43.166
You do realize the whole village
will know within the hour?

1:09:43.250 --> 1:09:44.250
Know what?

1:09:44.791 --> 1:09:46.250
That we're, um…

1:09:47.916 --> 1:09:50.291
-What are we?
-Maybe we don't need a title.

1:09:50.375 --> 1:09:51.875
Well, I am the Duke of Dunbar.

1:09:51.958 --> 1:09:53.000
Really?

1:09:53.958 --> 1:09:55.583
You never mentioned that.

1:10:02.833 --> 1:10:03.708
Oh.

1:10:04.833 --> 1:10:08.000
Don't tell me you're one of those people
who likes snow on Christmas Eve?

1:10:15.083 --> 1:10:16.083
Come on, then.

1:11:27.083 --> 1:11:28.916
Oh!

1:11:29.458 --> 1:11:31.625
-Um…

1:11:31.708 --> 1:11:34.041
Well, what's left now?

1:11:34.875 --> 1:11:37.666
-You look like you wanna say something.
-Not really.

1:11:37.750 --> 1:11:38.583
Then I do.

1:11:39.125 --> 1:11:40.500
-Do you have to?

1:11:41.291 --> 1:11:43.708
Look, I was thinking…

1:11:43.791 --> 1:11:45.583
…what happens after Christmas?

1:11:46.458 --> 1:11:49.458
-Because I was thinking--
-You've been doing a lot of thinking.

1:11:49.541 --> 1:11:52.833
-What are you thinking?
-I'm trying not to!

1:11:52.916 --> 1:11:54.041
You could stay.

1:11:58.416 --> 1:11:59.458
S… Stay?

1:12:01.125 --> 1:12:03.333
-At Dun Dunbar.

1:12:05.375 --> 1:12:07.291
What? You mean you…

1:12:07.375 --> 1:12:08.625
…you'd let me stay

1:12:08.708 --> 1:12:12.166
in the place I've lived my whole life
as a guest?

1:12:13.458 --> 1:12:14.958
-No, as--
-As a what, then?

1:12:15.041 --> 1:12:16.791
-As a tenant?
-No.

1:12:16.875 --> 1:12:20.708
Maybe as your boyfriend, then?
Or Mr. Emma Gale? What's his name?

1:12:20.791 --> 1:12:22.833
Um, Winston, wasn't it?

1:12:23.458 --> 1:12:25.708
Aye. And we know what happened to him.

1:12:27.250 --> 1:12:29.125
-What are you doing?
-What am I doing?

1:12:30.666 --> 1:12:31.833
You show up here,

1:12:32.666 --> 1:12:34.083
buy my castle,

1:12:34.833 --> 1:12:37.166
take over the place,
take over my whole life,

1:12:37.250 --> 1:12:42.000
and now you offer me
a room in my own house!

1:12:42.958 --> 1:12:44.125
Ugh!

1:12:44.208 --> 1:12:46.666
I should never have let you in
in the first place.

1:12:46.750 --> 1:12:48.708
You don't get to walk away like that.

1:12:48.791 --> 1:12:50.416
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:12:51.541 --> 1:12:53.541
Do I need your permission, Your Highness?

1:12:54.791 --> 1:12:57.666
I can't believe I was starting to think
we could be happy here.

1:12:58.250 --> 1:13:01.250
-There's that "we" again.
-Yeah, "we." That's right.

1:13:01.750 --> 1:13:04.833
Two people who have just spent
three months together.

1:13:04.916 --> 1:13:07.458
I was doing just fine until you showed up!

1:13:07.541 --> 1:13:09.083
-Were you?
-Aye!

1:13:09.166 --> 1:13:12.208
Oh, well, looks like you win, then.

1:13:12.833 --> 1:13:15.375
Because this place
is just gonna remind me of you.

1:13:17.333 --> 1:13:19.166
The deal is off.

1:13:20.541 --> 1:13:23.000
Enjoy your 12 empty bedrooms.

1:13:24.333 --> 1:13:25.791
Leave the key on your way out.

1:13:25.875 --> 1:13:28.375
Oh, you really are a royal ass.

1:13:29.416 --> 1:13:31.375
You can't say I didn't warn you!

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.916
-I'm gonna miss you, Hamish. Oh.

1:13:55.833 --> 1:13:57.708
-Yeah, gonna miss you.

1:14:17.083 --> 1:14:19.291
Don't worry. I do it every day.

1:14:21.666 --> 1:14:23.125
Oh, no.

1:14:26.666 --> 1:14:28.125
Oh, Thomas.

1:14:56.041 --> 1:14:58.041
Are you really
just going to let her leave?

1:14:58.125 --> 1:14:59.208
That was the plan.

1:14:59.708 --> 1:15:04.125
Ugh. You and your
stubborn Dunbar pride, eh?

1:15:04.208 --> 1:15:07.541
Castles are meant to have
walls around them. People aren't.

1:15:07.625 --> 1:15:09.958
Without this castle, I have nothing.

1:15:10.458 --> 1:15:14.250
And what good is this place
without anyone in it?

1:15:43.666 --> 1:15:47.041
My flight leaves tomorrow.
I'll need a ride to Edinburgh.

1:15:47.125 --> 1:15:49.125
-Oh.
-Sophie, don't go.

1:15:49.208 --> 1:15:51.083
You can come and visit me.

1:15:51.166 --> 1:15:52.791
All of you. Anytime.

1:15:53.833 --> 1:15:55.916
And don't worry about your land

1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:58.750
because I'm paying off
all of your mortgages.

1:15:58.833 --> 1:15:59.833
Oh, now--

1:15:59.916 --> 1:16:01.875
I'll work everything out when I get back.

1:16:01.958 --> 1:16:03.208
Oh, Sophie, you can't do that.

1:16:03.291 --> 1:16:06.041
Consider it a gift from Emma Gale.

1:16:08.916 --> 1:16:12.083
Your friendship… means the world to me.

1:16:15.208 --> 1:16:17.208
I just made a mistake. That's all.

1:16:20.958 --> 1:16:24.083
Loving someone is never a mistake.

1:16:25.625 --> 1:16:26.666
Trust me on that.

1:16:26.750 --> 1:16:27.583
Angus!

1:16:29.583 --> 1:16:30.541
Oh, oh, oh.

1:16:34.666 --> 1:16:36.250
Um…

1:16:36.333 --> 1:16:40.583
I guess we'll be giving you
your Christmas present now, then.

1:16:41.375 --> 1:16:42.291
Oh.

1:16:43.833 --> 1:16:45.000
Thank you.

1:16:49.166 --> 1:16:50.125
Oh!

1:16:51.583 --> 1:16:53.500
Oh, I just… I love it.

1:16:53.583 --> 1:16:56.000
I really love it.

1:16:57.833 --> 1:16:58.791
Thank you.

1:17:00.041 --> 1:17:01.708
Package from Thomas for you.

1:17:06.250 --> 1:17:07.208
The dress.

1:17:08.458 --> 1:17:10.083
In case you change your mind.

1:17:21.416 --> 1:17:22.791
It's okay.

1:17:29.583 --> 1:17:30.625
Cheerio!

1:17:54.958 --> 1:17:57.583
What's going on?
Let's have a wee look here.

1:18:01.083 --> 1:18:02.500
-Happy Christmas.
-Aye.

1:18:06.458 --> 1:18:07.583
What's going on?

1:18:08.333 --> 1:18:10.208
-She's dead.
-Deed?

1:18:11.708 --> 1:18:13.875
Buggered. That'll be that, aye?

1:18:18.375 --> 1:18:20.750
-What are you doing?
-We're going back.

1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:24.166
To get another car?

1:18:24.750 --> 1:18:26.875
To the pub. For a wee dram.

1:18:27.458 --> 1:18:28.583
It's Christmas Eve.

1:18:35.458 --> 1:18:37.916
He cannot be the only driver in town.

1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:40.583
Edinburgh's two hours away,
longer in the snow,

1:18:40.666 --> 1:18:42.625
and everyone's going to the party.

1:18:42.708 --> 1:18:44.250
Your party.

1:18:44.750 --> 1:18:46.833
-Everyone?
-Wasn't that the idea?

1:18:46.916 --> 1:18:50.625
All right. I can borrow your car,
and I will have it driven back.

1:18:50.708 --> 1:18:54.208
When was the last time you drove a stick
on the left-hand side of the road?

1:18:54.291 --> 1:18:55.541
In a snowstorm?

1:18:55.625 --> 1:18:56.791
It's not snowing anymore.

1:18:56.875 --> 1:19:00.166
It is in Edinburgh.
My husband just called me from the road.

1:19:03.500 --> 1:19:06.750
What about you, Angus?
Will you drive me to the airport?

1:19:13.375 --> 1:19:14.375
Ah…

1:19:18.291 --> 1:19:21.541
Stay the night.
Someone will get you out in the morning.

1:19:22.416 --> 1:19:23.291
All right.

1:19:24.666 --> 1:19:26.208
But I'm not going to that party.

1:19:26.291 --> 1:19:29.541
You're just gonna spend Christmas Eve
here alone?

1:19:30.791 --> 1:19:31.875
I'm fine.

1:19:31.958 --> 1:19:32.791
You're not fine.

1:19:35.250 --> 1:19:36.166
I will be.

1:20:56.166 --> 1:20:58.041
Hey, honey, Lexi.

1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:02.166
It's Mom. I just wanted
to wish you a Merry Christmas.

1:21:03.916 --> 1:21:05.708
You're probably at the wedding.

1:21:07.583 --> 1:21:09.916
Hey, if she throws the bouquet,

1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:10.958
don't catch it.

1:21:12.875 --> 1:21:14.291
Okay. I love you.

1:21:20.083 --> 1:21:21.458
-Helen!
-Merry Christmas.

1:21:21.541 --> 1:21:23.041
Good evening to you.

1:21:23.125 --> 1:21:24.708
It's beautiful. I know.

1:21:25.666 --> 1:21:27.500
-In we go.
-Let's go in.

1:21:33.541 --> 1:21:35.625
<i>"But Winston wasn't dead."</i>

1:21:36.208 --> 1:21:39.458
<i>"It was a coma</i>
<i>brought on by his fall down the stairs."</i>

1:21:40.500 --> 1:21:41.416


1:21:44.250 --> 1:21:47.791
<i>"To her shock,</i>
<i>it wasn't Winston whose body lay there."</i>

1:21:48.375 --> 1:21:51.375
<i>"It was his twin brother, Myles."</i>

1:21:51.458 --> 1:21:52.750
-

1:22:01.666 --> 1:22:03.375
Oh! Sophie! Sophie, I'm sorry!

1:22:03.458 --> 1:22:04.583
Seriously?

1:22:05.791 --> 1:22:06.625
Sophie!

1:22:08.916 --> 1:22:11.708
-You eejit.

1:22:11.791 --> 1:22:12.791
I'm an eejit.

1:22:28.125 --> 1:22:31.000
-All right, come on, then.

1:22:58.958 --> 1:23:01.208
I just didn't expect this.

1:23:02.250 --> 1:23:03.083
Or you.

1:23:04.125 --> 1:23:06.916
I… I've done things a certain way
for a long time,

1:23:07.583 --> 1:23:10.291
and to have someone come in and just…

1:23:13.166 --> 1:23:16.041
I guess it finally hit me
that I'm losing the place.

1:23:18.958 --> 1:23:20.875
But I'd rather lose Dun Dunbar<i>…</i>

1:23:22.916 --> 1:23:24.000
than lose you.

1:23:25.791 --> 1:23:26.875
You want a castle?

1:23:27.916 --> 1:23:28.750
It's yours.

1:23:29.916 --> 1:23:32.416
You wanna go back to America?
I won't stop you.

1:23:34.833 --> 1:23:36.666
But I can't promise I won't follow you.

1:23:38.625 --> 1:23:39.791
Because I've fallen

1:23:40.791 --> 1:23:43.125
hopelessly and pathetically
in love with you.

1:23:46.375 --> 1:23:48.416
Maybe just hopelessly.

1:23:51.291 --> 1:23:53.625
I love you, too, you dobber.

1:23:58.291 --> 1:23:59.833
-Hm.
-You're an eejit.

1:24:00.500 --> 1:24:02.125
-I am, aren't I?

1:24:05.458 --> 1:24:08.458
-Hi!
-Lovely to see you. Have a great night.

1:24:08.541 --> 1:24:10.375
-Tom. Cheers.
-Where is he?

1:24:11.125 --> 1:24:13.458
I… I don't know.

1:24:14.250 --> 1:24:15.625
-Nice.
-Ah!

1:24:15.708 --> 1:24:17.291
-After you.
-Catch you in there.

1:24:17.375 --> 1:24:19.333
-Easy on that champagne.

1:24:19.416 --> 1:24:21.500
You're gonna have to do it for him.

1:24:22.625 --> 1:24:25.333
No, I'm going to do something for myself.

1:24:25.958 --> 1:24:26.791
Maisie,

1:24:28.250 --> 1:24:30.291
would you do me the honor of a dance?

1:24:40.083 --> 1:24:41.083
About time.

1:25:34.916 --> 1:25:37.250
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:25:38.208 --> 1:25:40.125
may I announce

1:25:40.208 --> 1:25:42.166
the 12th Duke of Dunbar

1:25:42.833 --> 1:25:45.166
and the Lady Sophie…

1:25:47.125 --> 1:25:49.125
McGuinty!

1:27:02.875 --> 1:27:04.750
-She's here.
-Oh, good. Good.

1:27:06.583 --> 1:27:08.125
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:27:08.208 --> 1:27:10.416
can I have your attention, please?

1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:12.541
Until recently,

1:27:12.625 --> 1:27:16.333
this place was as cold
as the winds off the Firth of Forth.

1:27:16.416 --> 1:27:17.708
Colder than that!

1:27:19.250 --> 1:27:21.166
Thank you, Eamon.

1:27:22.125 --> 1:27:25.791
I thought this castle was who I was.

1:27:27.500 --> 1:27:29.833
Or maybe even all I was.

1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:32.916
And then…

1:27:34.708 --> 1:27:38.833
then, I met a lass
who knocked me flat on my royal arse…

1:27:39.916 --> 1:27:44.625
…and she taught me that we should be
with the people we love on Christmas.

1:27:45.666 --> 1:27:47.541
And I realize that you,

1:27:48.791 --> 1:27:50.000
all of you here,

1:27:50.750 --> 1:27:52.041
are the people I love.

1:27:52.125 --> 1:27:53.583
You're my family.

1:27:55.666 --> 1:27:57.541
And so from this Christmas on,

1:27:58.208 --> 1:28:01.500
Dun Dunbar will throw a party
to end all parties for the village.

1:28:05.041 --> 1:28:06.000
And now,

1:28:06.500 --> 1:28:07.708
I am honored

1:28:08.458 --> 1:28:09.583
to introduce

1:28:10.625 --> 1:28:12.875
the granddaughter of Callum McGuinty,

1:28:13.583 --> 1:28:15.125
who worked this land

1:28:15.208 --> 1:28:18.458
and had stones enough
to carve his name in this very castle.

1:28:20.916 --> 1:28:22.541
Lexi!

1:28:23.416 --> 1:28:24.583
Oh!

1:28:24.666 --> 1:28:26.416
Ooh!

1:28:26.500 --> 1:28:28.250
What are you doing here?

1:28:28.333 --> 1:28:30.208
Myles got me a plane ticket.

1:28:30.791 --> 1:28:32.916
Oh. What about your father's wedding?

1:28:33.541 --> 1:28:35.166
Nah, I'll just go to the next one.

1:28:35.250 --> 1:28:37.333
-Oh!
-Want a wee drinkie?

1:28:38.041 --> 1:28:38.916
Thank you.

1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:40.250
I'm learning.

1:28:40.333 --> 1:28:43.000
Well, you did go to Oxford.

1:28:43.083 --> 1:28:44.000
And Cambridge.

1:28:44.083 --> 1:28:45.416
Oh, yes, of course.

1:28:45.500 --> 1:28:47.791
And now, to the McGuintys.

1:28:47.875 --> 1:28:50.291
-To the McGuintys.
-The McGuintys!

1:28:54.666 --> 1:28:57.083
Oh, Rhona, you've excelled yourself.

1:28:57.666 --> 1:28:59.250
-She made all of it.
-Did she?

1:28:59.333 --> 1:29:01.333
-She should have a shop.
-Yeah, of course.

1:29:01.416 --> 1:29:03.083
I'll pass them round.

1:29:03.166 --> 1:29:05.000
-Have you had one of these?
-Oh my lord!

1:29:05.083 --> 1:29:09.000
-Rhona has gone mad. She is wonderful.
-Now that is a work of art.

1:29:11.041 --> 1:29:12.791
-Mm-mmm.

1:29:28.875 --> 1:29:30.583
Angus! Wow!

1:29:38.041 --> 1:29:39.125
Hamish!

1:29:40.125 --> 1:29:41.291
Go, Angus!

1:29:45.208 --> 1:29:46.250
Oh, oh!

1:30:18.291 --> 1:30:19.208
Well,

1:30:20.583 --> 1:30:23.083
merry Christmas to you, Hamish.

1:30:24.708 --> 1:30:26.750
All right,
what do you think of this?

1:30:27.458 --> 1:30:29.500
<i>The Heart of a Warrior.</i>

1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:32.000


1:30:35.083 --> 1:30:36.416
By Sophie McGuinty.

1:30:36.500 --> 1:30:37.583


1:30:37.666 --> 1:30:39.583


1:30:39.666 --> 1:30:40.958
"In this day and age…

1:30:43.166 --> 1:30:44.250
not everyone…

1:30:46.375 --> 1:30:48.375
believes in happy endings."

1:30:48.458 --> 1:30:50.041
"But I just might."

1:30:52.250 --> 1:30:54.000
-Merry Christmas, Mom.

1:30:54.083 --> 1:30:55.750
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1:30:55.833 --> 1:30:59.000
Good morning and Merry Christmas.

1:30:59.083 --> 1:31:01.250
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1:31:02.500 --> 1:31:03.625
Sophie, my dear…

1:31:06.083 --> 1:31:07.916
I've got a wee present for you.

1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:09.166
Oh!

1:31:38.333 --> 1:31:39.750
Oh, even from backstage.

1:31:39.833 --> 1:31:42.333
Adam, don't forget to cue me.
Okay, perfect. Thank you.

1:31:42.416 --> 1:31:44.458
Are we shooting them on all three cameras?

1:31:44.541 --> 1:31:46.083
You've gotta love that!

1:31:46.166 --> 1:31:47.333
-Cut!
-What?

1:31:47.416 --> 1:31:49.416
Congratulations, Sophie,

1:31:49.500 --> 1:31:53.333
on your huge, new best seller,
<i>Heart of a Warrior.</i>

1:31:53.416 --> 1:31:54.250
Oh wow.

1:31:54.333 --> 1:31:56.541
-Thank you. It is so nice to be back.

1:31:56.625 --> 1:31:59.708
Everybody feels
that this is your best novel yet.

1:31:59.791 --> 1:32:03.041
Oh! Oh, it's my best book yet.
Guess we do get a happy ending.

1:32:03.125 --> 1:32:06.625
-That's what people want.
-Not that kind of a happy ending.

1:32:09.166 --> 1:32:13.625
Since you were last here, it seems like
your life has become a total fairy tale.

1:32:13.708 --> 1:32:18.666
You bought a castle in Scotland,
moved to Ireland… Scot-land.

1:32:18.750 --> 1:32:21.166
-It's a new province.
-It's near Disneyland.

1:32:21.250 --> 1:32:23.708
-It's a little to the side. Yeah.
-Exactly.

1:32:25.708 --> 1:32:28.583
Is it fair to say
that you're going to become a duchess?

1:32:28.666 --> 1:32:32.333
Uh… Wait, do we get married,
or do you just… What?

1:32:32.416 --> 1:32:34.166
-Wait, and also--
-He didn't even propose!

1:32:36.208 --> 1:32:37.416
How are they navigating it?

1:32:41.500 --> 1:32:43.500
-I know.
-Five days a week. Know what I mean?

1:32:44.291 --> 1:32:46.583
-I do.

1:32:46.666 --> 1:32:47.958
I really do.

1:32:48.041 --> 1:32:49.708
-Welcome back, Sophie…

1:32:49.791 --> 1:32:54.208
…and a huge congratulations
on your juggernaut best seller.

1:32:54.291 --> 1:32:56.083
I also don't wanna say
the word  "juggernaut."

1:32:56.166 --> 1:33:00.875
No, no, it was funny that she came out
with that, with her head and her brain.

1:33:00.958 --> 1:33:04.375
"Juggernaut" is a very harsh,
male, masculine,
