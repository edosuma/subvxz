¶ Boy, the way                  
Glenn Miller played ¶           

00:05.672 --> 00:09.340
            ¶ Songs that made   
                The Hit Parade ¶

We had it made ¶                

00:13.013 --> 00:16.280
    ¶ Those were the days ¶     

00:16.282 --> 00:20.284
               <i>¶ And you knew</i>   
           <i>Where you were then ¶</i>

00:20.286 --> 00:23.622
 <i>¶ Girls were girls</i>

00:23.624 --> 00:30.394

00:40.874 --> 00:46.678
¶ Those were the days ¶         

00:54.120 --> 00:56.855
Oh, hello, Archie.              

00:56.857 --> 00:59.090
Did you have a nice day?        

00:59.092 --> 01:01.793
                Edith, I'm gonna
                turn around slow

01:01.795 --> 01:03.594
              and let you have  
              a look at my face.

01:03.596 --> 01:06.064
        Then you tell me what   
        kind of a day I had.    

01:11.403 --> 01:13.571
                  EDITH:        
                  That bad, huh?

01:13.573 --> 01:15.006
                Yeah, and to top
                everything off, 

01:15.008 --> 01:17.275
        tonight on the subway   
        was worse than ever.    

01:17.277 --> 01:18.943
                I come down     
                on that platform

01:18.945 --> 01:20.311
             and it's absolutely
             jammed, Edith,     

01:20.313 --> 01:22.881
             and I says,        
    "God, if that train comes in

01:22.883 --> 01:24.615
      "and there's an empty seat
             on the train,      

01:24.617 --> 01:27.686
"I'm gonna give Edith 5 bucks   
    for church on Sunday."      

01:27.688 --> 01:30.689
             And I says,        
    "God, if there happens to be

01:30.691 --> 01:32.991
             "on that empty seat
                 a newspaper,   

01:32.993 --> 01:34.358
 "I'll go with Edith to church  

01:34.360 --> 01:36.061
              and I'll give you 
            the 5 bucks myself."

01:36.063 --> 01:37.528
What happened?                  

01:37.530 --> 01:40.031
              The train comes in
                and so help me, 

01:40.033 --> 01:42.500
        there's an empty seat   
            on that train,      

01:42.502 --> 01:44.202
             and you ain't gonna
                believe this,   

01:44.204 --> 01:46.404
        but on the empty seat   
            there's a newspaper.

01:46.406 --> 01:49.273
Oh, Archie, ain't               
that wonderful?!                

01:49.275 --> 01:51.242
Your prayers were answered.     

01:51.244 --> 01:52.410
                 Hold it, Edith.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.378
            Hold it, hold it,   
                    hold it.    

01:54.380 --> 01:56.047
            The newspaper on the
            seat was this here.

02:06.158 --> 02:10.228
Does that mean you ain't        
going to church with me?        

02:10.229 --> 02:11.863
                That's right.   

02:11.865 --> 02:14.065
 <i>The Jewish Daily Forward</i>       
     ain't exactly the answer   

02:14.067 --> 02:14.933
         to my prayer.          

02:16.936 --> 02:20.071
What about the $5               
for the church?                 

02:20.073 --> 02:21.740
        Oh, no, that's canceled.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.842
Why don't you give the $5       
        to a synagogue?         

02:28.614 --> 02:30.581
  I'll give $5 to a synagogue   

02:30.583 --> 02:33.752
  on the day that I can do the  
crossword puzzle in this paper. 

02:35.020 --> 02:36.354
                  Take it.      

02:39.091 --> 02:41.025
Oh, thank you, Archie.          

02:41.027 --> 02:43.494
I wonder                        
where the puzzle is.            

02:45.631 --> 02:48.166
            I wonder where      
        the supper is, Edith.   

02:48.168 --> 02:49.467
      Right away, Archie.       

02:50.903 --> 02:52.237
  What's the matter with you,   
        Meathead?               

02:52.239 --> 02:53.938
  Can't you understand English  
          over there?           

02:53.940 --> 02:55.339
            Come on,            
  clear the table for supper.   

02:55.341 --> 02:56.808
     The library is closed.     

02:56.810 --> 02:58.042
    Right away, Arch.           

02:59.245 --> 03:00.278
     No back talk from you?     

03:00.280 --> 03:02.380
      Why should there be       
         any back talk?         

03:02.382 --> 03:03.782
You told Ma                     
to get dinner ready,            

03:03.784 --> 03:04.949
so I'm clearing                 
the table.                      

03:04.951 --> 03:06.350
When you're right,              
you're right.                   

03:06.352 --> 03:07.551
            Thank you very much.

03:07.553 --> 03:11.256
    Doesn't happen often...     

03:11.258 --> 03:12.791
    but when it does,           

03:12.793 --> 03:14.826
        I like to share         
    the experience with you.    

03:14.828 --> 03:16.427
    Get away from me!           
    Get away from me!           

03:16.429 --> 03:17.295
Goodbye.                        

03:20.866 --> 03:22.834
     Aw, gee, Edith. Edith!     

03:22.836 --> 03:24.068
Yeah.                           

03:24.070 --> 03:26.504
  Edith, how can anybody read   
         in this room?          

03:26.506 --> 03:28.506
    Why don't you get           
      more powerful bulbs       

03:28.508 --> 03:29.908
    for the lights in here?     

03:29.910 --> 03:32.944
Oh, Archie, it ain't the light. 

03:32.946 --> 03:34.846
It's what I've been             
trying to tell you...           

03:34.848 --> 03:36.314
        Now, listen, listen,    
         don't start that again.

03:36.316 --> 03:37.548
Oh, but Archie--                

03:37.550 --> 03:39.617
            I never wore glasses
              in my whole life, 

03:39.619 --> 03:41.019
            and I ain't going   
                 to start now.  

03:41.021 --> 03:44.189
But it's nothing                
to be ashamed of.               

03:44.191 --> 03:45.723
It's nature.                    

03:45.725 --> 03:47.391
Everybody has                   
a little trouble                

03:47.393 --> 03:49.294
seeing the words close-up       

03:49.296 --> 03:51.229
after they pass                 
a certain age.                  

03:51.231 --> 03:54.398
    I tell you it ain't age!    

03:55.835 --> 04:00.171
It's the ink they're using      
         in the paper.          

04:00.173 --> 04:02.540
    It ain't as black           
    as it used to be.           

04:02.542 --> 04:03.774
They're probably watering       
            it down             

04:03.776 --> 04:05.643
      like everything else      
    you buy nowadays.           

04:08.881 --> 04:10.081
      Go out and get the supper!

04:10.083 --> 04:11.249
Right away!                     

04:20.425 --> 04:22.426
         Getting about time     
to have your arms lengthened,   

04:22.428 --> 04:23.461
                  huh, Arch?    

04:29.235 --> 04:30.634
            Maybe you ought     
            to get glasses, huh?

04:30.636 --> 04:31.870
Get away from me, huh?          

04:31.872 --> 04:34.072
        I mean, I saw the way   
     you were reading the paper.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.674
  You might as well get glasses.
  It'd be a lot easier for you. 

04:36.676 --> 04:38.076
                Holding them out
                like that?      
Will you...                     

04:38.078 --> 04:39.277
                  Will you get  
                  away from me?!

04:39.279 --> 04:40.378
        Oh, my goodness.        

04:40.380 --> 04:42.813
  How did you get into a fight  
        so quick?               

04:42.815 --> 04:45.183
This guy came downstairs.       

04:46.318 --> 04:48.786
         What happened?         
                I don't know.   

04:48.788 --> 04:51.189
     I made a joke about the way
     he was reading the paper.  

04:51.191 --> 04:52.357
                He goes bananas.

04:52.359 --> 04:55.193
Oh, Archie,                     
I know how you feel,            

04:55.195 --> 04:57.495
but just because                
you need glasses                

04:57.497 --> 04:59.097
don't mean nothing.             

04:59.099 --> 05:00.198
Well, look at me.               

05:00.200 --> 05:02.367
I've needed glasses             
for years,                      

05:02.369 --> 05:04.402
and you're older                
than I am.                      

05:04.404 --> 05:06.504
         That's only because    
          I was born first.     

05:09.174 --> 05:10.341
         Hi, everybody.         

05:10.343 --> 05:11.409
                             Hi.
Oh, hi, Gloria.                 

05:11.411 --> 05:12.410
            Hi, Ma.             

05:12.412 --> 05:13.411
I'll set the table.             

05:13.413 --> 05:14.412
Hi, Daddy.                      

05:14.414 --> 05:15.446
                  What about me?

05:15.448 --> 05:16.647
        I saved the best        
        for last.               

05:16.649 --> 05:17.782
                             Ah.

05:17.784 --> 05:18.917
     Oh, look at this here.     

05:18.919 --> 05:20.418
      She hasn't even got       
         her coat off,          

05:20.420 --> 05:22.020
    and he's jumping on her.    

05:24.489 --> 05:27.191
    [SEXY VOICE] Well,          
 then I'll take it off, Daddy.  

05:27.193 --> 05:29.727
Cut that out!                   

05:29.729 --> 05:31.329
You're in a good mood tonight.  
What happened?                  

05:31.331 --> 05:32.931
Did you get a seat on           
the subway?                     

05:32.933 --> 05:33.998
            Better than that.   

05:34.000 --> 05:36.100
        I got a ride all the way
             home from work.    

05:36.102 --> 05:37.468
Yeah?                           
Who gave you a lift?            

05:37.470 --> 05:39.037
             Mr. Clifton, the   
             buyer in cosmetics.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.205
Since when are you              
so chummy with him?             

05:41.207 --> 05:43.507
            Michael,            
  you're not jealous, are you?  

05:43.509 --> 05:46.244
No, I just don't                
like you riding around          

05:46.246 --> 05:47.645
with strange men,               
that's all.                     

05:47.647 --> 05:49.847
                Oh, Michael,    
        he's in his late 40s.   

05:49.849 --> 05:51.282
                He's old enough 
                to be my father.

05:51.284 --> 05:54.052
        Hey, hey,               
 what kind of a crack is that?! 

05:55.187 --> 05:56.387
          Nothing. What'd I say?

05:56.389 --> 05:57.721
You know                        
what you said.                  

05:57.723 --> 05:58.889
        What's going on?        

05:58.891 --> 06:00.291
              Archie's worried  
              about getting old.

06:00.293 --> 06:01.525
  I ain't worried about that,   

06:01.527 --> 06:03.527
    and I don't want to hear    
     nothing more about old     

06:03.529 --> 06:04.528
         in this house!         

06:04.530 --> 06:05.396
            Come on.            
    Let's eat supper.           

06:07.499 --> 06:10.435
Uh, Daddy, did you              
pick up my watch?               

06:10.437 --> 06:11.735
                     What watch?

06:11.737 --> 06:14.105
        My wristwatch,          
the one that's being repaired.  

06:14.107 --> 06:15.306
        No, I didn't pick it up.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.141
        Why didn't you remind me
        about it last night?    

06:17.143 --> 06:18.909
                I did remind you
                last night.     

06:18.911 --> 06:20.611
             You said you would.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.180
          I don't remember that.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.982
 Sure, Arch, it was at dinner.  
          I heard you.          

06:23.984 --> 06:26.484
         You didn't hear that   
      because I didn't say that,

06:26.486 --> 06:28.086
      and you didn't say nothing
        about it neither.       

06:28.088 --> 06:29.887
Wait a second.                  
Ma heard you too, right, Ma?    

06:29.889 --> 06:32.490
No, I don't remember.           

06:32.492 --> 06:34.993
When you get older,             
you forget...                   

06:36.928 --> 06:38.662
Oh, no, Archie!                 

06:38.664 --> 06:43.601
No! I didn't mean you.          
I meant me.                     

06:43.603 --> 06:46.871
              I don't wanna hear
                 nothing more   

06:46.873 --> 06:50.141
            about getting old   
                 at this table! 

06:50.143 --> 06:51.742
        In fact, I don't want   
              to hear nothing   

06:51.744 --> 06:52.977
                  about nothing!

07:18.703 --> 07:20.104
Arch, everybody gets old...     

07:24.009 --> 07:26.077
EDITH: Archie,                  
where are you going?            

07:26.079 --> 07:28.446
I'm going to where youse people 
      have been sending me      

07:28.448 --> 07:29.547
    for the last half hour,     

07:29.549 --> 07:31.916
    to the old folks' home.     

07:31.918 --> 07:33.284
        And on the way,         

07:33.286 --> 07:35.053
    I'm gonna stop off          
        at Kelsey's Bar,        

07:35.055 --> 07:36.787
         and I'm gonna          
    have a couple of beers.     

07:36.789 --> 07:40.624
    And maybe for my dinner,    
 I'll gum down a few pretzels.  

07:47.166 --> 07:49.067
                  So you get the
                  picture, see? 

07:49.069 --> 07:50.501
          There's this big crate
              on the ground,    

07:50.503 --> 07:52.937
        and we got to get it up 
      onto the loading platform.

07:52.939 --> 07:55.139
              Now, we got all   
        these young wise guys   

07:55.141 --> 07:56.640
                 standing around
                  staring at it 

07:56.642 --> 07:58.609
         like they never heard  
      of the word "muscle," see?

07:58.611 --> 08:00.445
                 So I call over 
            to Petey Brobich,   

08:00.447 --> 08:02.280
              "Petey, come on.  
        Give me a hand here."   

08:02.282 --> 08:03.914
              Petey gets one end
                  of it, see,   

08:03.916 --> 08:05.916
    with his hands, and I get   
          the other end here.   

08:05.918 --> 08:08.652
              Mind you, this is 
              a 500-pound crate.

08:08.654 --> 08:09.720
        We grabbed that crate   

08:09.722 --> 08:11.021
                 and alley-oop  
                 off the ground,

08:11.023 --> 08:12.623
        right up like a feather,
        onto the platform.      

08:12.625 --> 08:13.824
                    What do you 
                  think of that?

08:13.826 --> 08:15.226
Well, you was                   
in pretty good shape            

08:15.228 --> 08:16.094
in them days, Arch.             

08:20.799 --> 08:22.600
      What the hell do you mean,
            "in them days"?     

08:22.602 --> 08:24.402
Well, Petey Brobich             
dropped dead                    

08:24.404 --> 08:25.503
more than 15 years ago.         

08:27.272 --> 08:28.772
                  Fifteen years?
                You're crazy.   

08:28.774 --> 08:30.141
No, no.                         
I remember it well.             

08:30.143 --> 08:32.543
It was my first                 
anniversary in this bar.        

08:32.544 --> 08:34.111
I was serving free eats.        

08:34.114 --> 08:35.313
Petey comes in,                 

08:35.315 --> 08:36.746
takes one of                    
my hard-boiled eggs             

08:36.749 --> 08:37.948
and drops dead.                 

08:39.683 --> 08:41.852
ARCHIE:                         
That long ago.                  

08:41.854 --> 08:44.489
Gee, where does time            
fly to, anyway.                 

08:44.491 --> 08:45.523
             Let me have a beer.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.690
Yeah, coming up.                

08:46.692 --> 08:51.162
          Hey, Kelsey,          
how old would you say I looked? 

08:51.164 --> 08:52.396
Arch,                           
at bartender college,           

08:52.398 --> 08:54.198
they taught us three things     
you don't talk about:           

08:54.200 --> 08:56.501
politics,                       
religion, and age.              

08:56.503 --> 08:59.237
We stick to the safe subjects   
like taxes,                     

08:59.239 --> 09:01.071
which everybody's against.      

09:01.073 --> 09:03.608
                And women, which
                everybody's for.

09:03.610 --> 09:04.642
Hey, that's                     
pretty good, huh?               

09:04.644 --> 09:06.210
        Yeah.                   
[CASH REGISTER RINGS]           

09:06.212 --> 09:08.312
Uh, hey, excuse me.             

09:08.314 --> 09:09.580
Don't I know you                
from someplace?                 

09:09.582 --> 09:11.882
      I don't know. You tell me.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.885
  Well, to me you kind of look  
  like the Mulheron family...   

09:14.887 --> 09:17.087
      I got it. I got it.       

09:17.089 --> 09:19.157
     You're Bill Mulheron's     
          kid brother.          

09:19.159 --> 09:21.526
          Better than that.     
          I'm Bill Mulheron.    

09:24.929 --> 09:26.364
              No.               

09:26.366 --> 09:27.498
                        Sure am.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.732
    You're Bill Mul--           

09:28.734 --> 09:30.268
                         Uh-huh.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.803
    Well, I'll be. You are.     

09:32.805 --> 09:33.804
      Hey, come over here!      

09:33.806 --> 09:35.640
How are you?                    
How you been?                   

09:35.642 --> 09:36.774
                Great, great.   

09:36.776 --> 09:37.775
                     Just great.

09:37.777 --> 09:39.177
                 Now can I ask  
                 you a question?

09:39.179 --> 09:40.545
Yeah, sure.                     
                Who are you?    

09:44.816 --> 09:46.016
You don't remember me,          
Archie Bunker?                  

09:46.018 --> 09:47.585
            Archie Bunker?      

09:47.587 --> 09:48.719
        I thought you were dead.

09:55.460 --> 09:58.028
No. No, I'm still alive.        

09:59.831 --> 10:01.232
      Gee.                      

10:01.234 --> 10:03.301
Well, I ain't seen you          
in a long time.                 

10:03.303 --> 10:05.636
How long has it been--          
15, 20 years?                   

10:05.638 --> 10:06.937
              Are you kidding?  

10:06.939 --> 10:07.938
                 Closer to 30.  

10:07.940 --> 10:11.442
What? 30 years?                 

10:11.444 --> 10:13.644
I can't get over it.            

10:13.646 --> 10:15.446
Well, what brings you back      
to the old neighborhood?        

10:15.448 --> 10:17.047
      I'm meeting a friend here.

10:17.049 --> 10:19.250
     Oh, yeah.                  

10:19.252 --> 10:22.953
Gee, Bill, you don't look       
a day older.                    

10:22.955 --> 10:24.988
I mean, what are you doing?     
Taking shots?                   

10:24.990 --> 10:27.825
            No, just work out   
                every day,      

10:27.827 --> 10:29.927
        take care of myself,    
        keep myself in shape.   

10:29.929 --> 10:32.563
        The most important thing
            is up here.         

10:32.565 --> 10:33.831
              You gotta be young
                 in your head.  

10:34.966 --> 10:37.134
Well, I heard of that.          

10:37.136 --> 10:38.603
Hey, hey, Kelsey.               

10:38.605 --> 10:41.138
Say hello to an old friend      
    of mine, Bill Mulheron.     

10:41.140 --> 10:42.440
 Shake hands with Kelsey here.  

10:42.442 --> 10:43.441
                Hiya, Kelsey.   

10:43.443 --> 10:44.842
Put a head on these beers.      

10:44.844 --> 10:46.810
            No, no, no, no!     
            Just one a night.   

10:46.812 --> 10:48.346
So you two guys                 
know each other?                

10:48.348 --> 10:51.315
    Sure! We was in the same    
  high school class together.   

10:51.317 --> 10:52.316
You're kidding.                 

10:52.318 --> 10:54.151
              Yep, that's right.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.487
                Same age,       
              believe it or not.

10:59.324 --> 11:00.324
              You've gotta watch

11:00.326 --> 11:02.993
                 that middle-age
                 spread, Arch.  

11:02.995 --> 11:04.061
                  Be right back.

11:04.063 --> 11:05.363
                 I'm going to   
                 the boys' room.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.464
              Ah.               

11:08.032 --> 11:10.368
You're the same age             
as him?                         

11:10.370 --> 11:11.802
                Yeah.           

11:11.804 --> 11:15.473
But you look like you got       
10, 15 years on him.            

11:17.643 --> 11:19.477
        Why don't you go back   
          to bartender's college

11:19.479 --> 11:21.812
            and take a course   
                  in Shut Up?   

11:40.632 --> 11:41.865
MICHAEL: What are you           
talking about?                  

11:41.867 --> 11:44.368
         You're a meathead      
         and you always will be!

11:44.370 --> 11:46.637
    Don't you know enough       
    not to walk into a toilet   

11:46.639 --> 11:48.172
              when there's      
              somebody in there?

11:50.142 --> 11:52.075
I didn't know                   
you were in there.              

11:52.077 --> 11:53.043
The door was half open.         

11:54.179 --> 11:57.014
        It was also half closed,

11:57.016 --> 11:58.482
        and that's the part     
        you got to respect.     

11:59.784 --> 12:01.152
What are you, upset             

12:01.154 --> 12:03.154
because I caught you in there   
checking for bald spots?        

12:03.156 --> 12:04.955
            I wasn't doing that!

12:04.957 --> 12:06.557
Then what were you doing        
using Gloria's mirror,          

12:06.559 --> 12:08.892
checking the back of your head  
in the bathroom mirror?         

12:08.894 --> 12:09.793
        Looking for dandruff.   

12:11.896 --> 12:12.896
Come on, Archie.                

12:12.898 --> 12:14.431
You were checking               
for fallen hair.                

12:14.433 --> 12:16.833
    I was not. I haven't lost   
    any hair in over a year.    

12:16.835 --> 12:17.901
Oh, yeah?                       

12:17.903 --> 12:19.570
Then what was that hair         
doing on your comb?             

12:21.173 --> 12:23.574
     Maybe I'm growing new hair.
     Did you ever think of that?

12:23.576 --> 12:24.875
    What?!                      

12:24.877 --> 12:26.677
         That's right, that hair
          you seen on the comb. 

12:26.679 --> 12:27.911
        That's the old hair,    

12:27.913 --> 12:30.147
which the new hair growing in   
          is pushing out.       

12:30.149 --> 12:32.115
            Archie,             
      where are you going?      

12:32.117 --> 12:33.984
  I got your lunch all ready.   

12:33.986 --> 12:35.252
I'm going down to Kelsey's Bar, 

12:35.254 --> 12:36.853
    where a man can go          
        into the toilet         

12:36.855 --> 12:37.988
  without attracting a crowd.   

12:39.157 --> 12:40.157
Arch...                         

12:40.159 --> 12:41.024
Can I eat your lunch?           

12:46.231 --> 12:47.097
              Get away from me. 

12:48.633 --> 12:49.900
                      Daddy, hi.
    Get away                    
    from me.                    

12:51.769 --> 12:53.003
                    What's wrong
                    with him?   

12:53.005 --> 12:54.905
He's still hung up              
on that age thing.              

12:54.907 --> 12:57.575
        Oh, yeah,               
he's so worried about it,       

12:57.577 --> 13:00.444
 he don't act natural no more.  

13:00.446 --> 13:04.815
 If he ain't yelling about it,  
  he's sitting there staring.   

13:04.817 --> 13:07.318
     Like the other evening     
     when you two were out,     

13:07.320 --> 13:10.321
         he sat through         
      the whole 7:00 news       

13:10.323 --> 13:14.291
 without blowing one raspberry  
      at Walter Cronkite.       

13:15.527 --> 13:19.463
            Well, remember how  
            funny you acted, Ma?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.164
    I mean, when you were       
    going through the change?   

13:22.567 --> 13:26.303
Oh, I don't think               
Archie's getting hot flashes.   

13:29.907 --> 13:32.075
                        No.     

13:32.077 --> 13:33.910
        But that's why he's been
            so moody lately.    

13:33.912 --> 13:36.380
Well, he was up                 
early this morning              

13:36.382 --> 13:38.014
doing his exercises.            

13:38.016 --> 13:39.750
        Daddy was exercising?   

13:39.752 --> 13:40.851
Oh, yeah.                       

13:40.853 --> 13:42.986
He tried                        
to touch his toes.              

13:44.556 --> 13:45.756
                 Did he make it?

13:45.758 --> 13:47.924
Yeah, after he sat down.        

13:49.394 --> 13:52.162
      You know what it is?      
  It's the capitalist system.   

13:53.765 --> 13:55.366
  That's right. That's right.   

13:55.368 --> 13:57.301
 It's Madison Avenue selling us 
     a phony youth culture.     

13:57.303 --> 13:58.902
     I mean, if you're not      
      young and beautiful,      

13:58.904 --> 14:00.137
    you're not worth a damn.    

14:00.139 --> 14:03.307
          What's wrong          
with being young and beautiful? 

14:03.309 --> 14:05.442
         Well, nothing,         
    if that's what you are,     

14:05.444 --> 14:07.077
        but what's wrong        
with being older and beautiful? 

14:07.079 --> 14:08.646
You know, Michael's right.      

14:08.648 --> 14:10.681
It's like all those ladies      
having their faces lifted       

14:10.683 --> 14:12.449
and their breasts lifted.       

14:12.451 --> 14:16.019
 Just last week, in the paper,  
 a woman had her bottom lifted. 

14:29.200 --> 14:31.468
            Oh, my.             

14:33.571 --> 14:37.107
     Wouldn't that make her     
     too tall to sit down?      

14:41.780 --> 14:43.246
Thanks, fellows.                
See you soon.                   

14:46.384 --> 14:47.484
            Hi there, Kelsey.   

14:47.486 --> 14:48.686
Oh, hi, Arch.                   
                BILL: Hey, Arch!

14:48.688 --> 14:50.354
How are you?                    

14:50.356 --> 14:51.522
        Oh, hiya there, Bill.   

14:51.524 --> 14:53.324
          What, are you making  
          a habit of this joint?

14:53.326 --> 14:54.325
I'm meeting                     
another friend.                 

14:54.327 --> 14:55.326
                     Oh.        

14:55.328 --> 14:56.993
Sit down, Arch,                 
you look beat.                  

14:56.995 --> 14:59.196
Kelse! Bring over               
a beer for Arch.                

14:59.198 --> 15:00.631
                  Yeah, I'm beat
                  all right.    

15:00.633 --> 15:02.165
          Walking over here now,

15:02.167 --> 15:03.634
    I felt something brushing   
              at my heels.      

15:03.636 --> 15:05.569
                 I looked down, 
                 it was my butt.

15:11.175 --> 15:12.943
You ought to start              
exercising, Arch.               

15:12.945 --> 15:14.311
That'll perk you up.            

15:14.313 --> 15:16.480
        Are you kidding?        
      I tried that this morning.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.782
                That's what's   
            got me the way I am.

15:18.784 --> 15:22.185
        Jeez, how do you do it? 
    How do you stay so young?   

15:22.187 --> 15:24.788
It's like I told you            
before, Arch.                   

15:24.790 --> 15:26.523
The secret is up here.          

15:26.525 --> 15:28.925
You want to stay young,         
you think young.                

15:28.927 --> 15:30.927
And wait'll you get a load      
of the young friend             

15:30.929 --> 15:32.329
 that's meeting me.             

15:32.331 --> 15:34.365
One look at her and you feel    
10 years younger.               

15:34.367 --> 15:36.700
    Ah, you're meeting a girl   
          in here, huh, Bill?   

15:37.869 --> 15:40.437
 When she gets here,            
    call me Brad.               

15:40.439 --> 15:42.539
            Brad? What for?     

15:42.541 --> 15:44.742
Well, it sounds younger.        

15:44.744 --> 15:47.711
"Bill" ain't got                
no pizzazz to it.               

15:47.713 --> 15:50.180
People start calling            
you Brad, and you...            

15:50.182 --> 15:53.484
you feel like a Brad.           

15:53.486 --> 15:55.886
Besides, my girlfriend's        
crazy about that name.          

15:55.888 --> 15:57.554
        Yeah, but wait a minute.

15:57.556 --> 15:59.590
          Didn't I hear long ago
        that you got married?   

15:59.592 --> 16:03.627
That's right, I'm married--     
22 years.                       

16:03.629 --> 16:05.262
              Oh.               

16:05.264 --> 16:07.163
  You're fooling around, huh?   

16:07.165 --> 16:08.365
        Now, look, Arch.        

16:08.367 --> 16:10.300
    You take some               
of your most famous men--       

16:10.302 --> 16:12.669
         Pablo Picasso,         
     that great painter...      

16:12.671 --> 16:14.438
over 80 and still going strong. 

16:14.440 --> 16:17.741
     Why? Because he keeps      
     marrying young girls.      

16:17.743 --> 16:19.676
         Then you take          
      that other Pablo...       

16:19.678 --> 16:20.711
            Casals.             

16:20.713 --> 16:22.646
     Oh, yeah, the welterweight.

16:25.583 --> 16:26.817
 No, no, no, the cello player.  

16:26.819 --> 16:28.585
        Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.   

16:29.754 --> 16:32.423
            Over 90             
and still fiddling around.      

16:32.425 --> 16:37.260
Why? Because he's married       
    to a young chick.           

16:38.530 --> 16:39.863
              Well, what are you
                  telling me?   

16:39.865 --> 16:41.264
            That you're gonna   
              get married again?

16:41.266 --> 16:44.301
No, I wouldn't do nothing       
to hurt my family.              

16:44.303 --> 16:47.237
 Look, Arch,                    
 I figure this way:             

16:47.239 --> 16:50.340
I'm doing my wife a big favor   
by keeping young for her.       

16:53.778 --> 16:55.879
 You married, Arch?             

16:55.881 --> 16:58.248
             Oh, me. Yeah, sure.
                  24 years.     

16:58.250 --> 17:01.485
Uh-huh. You ever,               
uh, fool around?                

17:03.087 --> 17:05.455
             Oh, sure.          

17:08.827 --> 17:11.394
    Well, uh, how much          
fooling around do you do?       

17:13.130 --> 17:15.231
              Enough.           

17:15.233 --> 17:17.968
  Enough. Well, does that mean  
        more than once?         

17:17.970 --> 17:19.903
            Oh, no,             
      come on, now there, Bill--

17:19.905 --> 17:20.904
Brad.                           

17:20.906 --> 17:22.238
        Uh, Brad, there.        

17:22.240 --> 17:24.040
You know, you ain't going       
     to get no information,     

17:24.041 --> 17:25.241
 because I ain't one of your... 

17:25.242 --> 17:27.042
         what do you call...    
          kiss-and-tellers.     

17:29.848 --> 17:31.348
        Hi, Brad.               

17:31.350 --> 17:32.349
Tina!                           

17:32.351 --> 17:33.584
         Oh, am I late?         

17:33.586 --> 17:36.119
Oh, baby,                       
you're never late.              

17:36.121 --> 17:38.522
Whenever you show up,           
it's just the right time.       

17:38.524 --> 17:41.658
        Oh, Brad, you're so     
        corny, but I love it.   

17:41.660 --> 17:42.526
        [LAUGHING]              

17:48.299 --> 17:50.734
Oh! Tina, I want you to meet    
an old friend of mine.          

17:50.736 --> 17:51.735
This is...                      

17:51.737 --> 17:53.704
        Uh, Greg Bunker.        

18:03.548 --> 18:06.817
Yeah. Yeah,                     
Greg, Greg Bunker.              

18:06.819 --> 18:08.184
This is Tina.                   

18:08.186 --> 18:09.452
    Hi.                         

18:09.454 --> 18:11.354
    Oh, I'm pleased to make     
    your acquaintanceship, Tina.

18:11.356 --> 18:12.489
          Oh!                   

18:12.491 --> 18:14.090
Sit down, Tina,                 
and I'll order some drinks.     

18:14.092 --> 18:15.291
             Ah, well, youse two
             are together.      

18:15.293 --> 18:16.493
                I'll be in      
                the way here.   

18:16.495 --> 18:18.562
    No, no. Sit down, relax.    
                Are you sure?   

18:18.564 --> 18:19.763
          Yeah, yeah,           
     you're gonna join us.      

18:19.765 --> 18:21.031
                      All right.

18:21.033 --> 18:24.367
    It'll be good for you...    
            up here.            

18:24.369 --> 18:26.436
      Uh, honey, excuse me
