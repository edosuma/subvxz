00:49.020 --> 00:51.981
JIHADIST SAFE HOUSE,
SARAJEVO

01:04.911 --> 01:07.662
It's not what you think.

01:07.664 --> 01:09.874
Mujo...

01:11.251 --> 01:14.128
Was acting strange.

01:14.921 --> 01:17.966
He started saying bad things.

01:18.591 --> 01:22.387
- What was he saying?
- He was going to betray me.

01:23.346 --> 01:26.975
When I asked him what he meant
by that, he just...

01:28.518 --> 01:30.977
He attacked me.

01:30.979 --> 01:36.943
Mujo, who swore to lay down
his life for you? Attacked you?

01:38.278 --> 01:41.114
I saw his true face.

01:44.284 --> 01:47.034
You don't believe me?

01:47.036 --> 01:50.081
Brother I believe you.

01:55.044 --> 01:56.963
It's okay.

02:01.134 --> 02:03.176
I'll clean this up.

02:03.178 --> 02:07.513
And then I have to go see our people,
make sure everything is arranged.

02:07.515 --> 02:10.183
Soon none of this will matter.

02:10.185 --> 02:13.561
Sergeant McAllister.
What is your greatest weakness?

02:13.563 --> 02:17.023
- You mean like kryptonite?
- Yeah, Mac, like kryptonite.

02:17.025 --> 02:19.317
That's exactly what they want
to know in an officer interview.

02:19.319 --> 02:21.694
Which fictional mineral
do you react to?

02:21.696 --> 02:24.197
- Come on, Mac, be serious.
- Alright.

02:24.199 --> 02:28.995
- Come on.
- Let's go. In 3, 2, 1.

02:31.789 --> 02:36.459
I suppose I've always wanted
to make a difference.

02:36.461 --> 02:41.297
I said I'll stick this out, as long
as there's something to fight for.

02:41.299 --> 02:43.966
And...

02:43.968 --> 02:49.933
You look around and there's always
something worth fighting for.

02:52.018 --> 02:54.312
I think I'm alright with that...

02:57.232 --> 03:01.067
Shit! I forgot the question.
Is that enough?

03:01.069 --> 03:05.196
You might wanna just tweak it a little,
you know. Make it a little less...

03:05.198 --> 03:07.281
- Less what?
- Depressing.

03:07.283 --> 03:09.075
It's not depressing. It's inspirational.

03:09.077 --> 03:12.578
Mac, you basically just said there's
nothing outside this job for you.

03:12.580 --> 03:14.705
That's dictionary definition depressing.

03:14.707 --> 03:18.626
Alright, well, here's one for you,
I outrank you.

03:18.628 --> 03:20.711
You can't order her
to like your answer.

03:20.713 --> 03:23.631
Course I can. What's the point
of having power if you can't abuse it?

03:23.633 --> 03:25.675
Hey! There you are.

03:25.677 --> 03:28.177
Chetri, what's your biggest weakness.

03:28.179 --> 03:31.055
People who silence their comms.
I've been trying to buzz you.

03:31.057 --> 03:34.892
Picked up the cell phone location for
a suspected deputy of Zayef and Mahir.

03:34.894 --> 03:36.646
Could be the break we need, come on.

04:08.970 --> 04:13.014
- How close are we?
- We have the location.

04:13.016 --> 04:16.767
We have support from the local cells.
You were right.

04:16.769 --> 04:19.022
They are willing to help,
all in the name of Zayef.

04:21.107 --> 04:23.983
- We are very lucky.
- Lucky?

04:23.985 --> 04:27.820
To be part of this.
To aid your brother.

04:27.822 --> 04:31.409
- It's an honor.
- Yes, it is wonderful.

04:34.287 --> 04:35.830
What are you doing?

04:39.083 --> 04:41.336
Is this your personal phone?

04:44.672 --> 04:48.049
My cousin's wife is expecting a baby.

04:48.051 --> 04:51.596
We issue burner phones for a reason.

04:58.978 --> 05:00.355
Zero Alpha, green set.

05:02.524 --> 05:04.190
Bravo One, blue set.

05:04.192 --> 05:07.570
If anyone was monitoring you,
they could easily track you here.

05:08.571 --> 05:13.032
Do you understand what we're about
to do? The scale of it?

05:13.034 --> 05:15.912
How many times
did you use the phone today?

05:20.792 --> 05:22.836
Idiot!

05:24.045 --> 05:27.674
Get back to work! All of you!

05:34.097 --> 05:35.890
Quiet...

05:50.446 --> 05:52.488
We've got a runner!

05:52.490 --> 05:55.410
Unconfirmed, it looks like Alpha Two!

05:58.788 --> 06:01.499
Confirmed, sending him your way.

06:10.216 --> 06:14.220
You look like you're having a bad day,
mate. It's about to get worse.

07:34.259 --> 07:36.970
STRIKE BACK

07:41.516 --> 07:45.268
On the right hand side.

07:45.270 --> 07:48.857
- Howdy, nice catch.
- Thank you, mate.

07:52.318 --> 07:55.029
- Keep eyes on the exterior.
- Copy that, boss.

08:04.664 --> 08:08.166
What's this? Pretty.

08:08.168 --> 08:10.545
Bravo One, your weapon.

08:18.011 --> 08:20.636
- Here.
- Nice one, space bar!

08:20.638 --> 08:22.223
Let' s go.

08:32.775 --> 08:35.361
- <i>We good?</i>
- Visual good, audio good.

08:56.549 --> 08:59.967
- Yes?
- <i>They hit us.</i>

08:59.969 --> 09:02.595
<i>Mahir has been taken.
We don't know where.</i>

09:02.597 --> 09:04.764
He's my brother.

09:04.766 --> 09:08.019
- I always know where he is.
- <i>Zayef...</i>

09:15.360 --> 09:18.321
Standby, we got a vehicle
approaching from the east.

09:32.043 --> 09:34.712
Alright, it's nothing. We're good.

09:36.339 --> 09:39.382
You've got me worried, Mahir.

09:39.384 --> 09:45.096
Weaponized viruses,
stolen Russian tech...

09:45.098 --> 09:50.434
There's money, arms, resources.
I've got a lot of questions.

09:50.436 --> 09:55.106
Perhaps you should have grabbed
my brother instead of me.

09:55.108 --> 09:56.983
He's the one in charge.

09:56.985 --> 10:00.778
I'm sure your as capable of committing
horrific acts of terror as the next man.

10:00.780 --> 10:05.076
I can barely even run,
Sergeant McAllister.

10:07.829 --> 10:11.622
Sorry, was I not meant
to know your name.

10:11.624 --> 10:16.752
Shrapnel, I was six or seven.

10:16.754 --> 10:21.424
A woman in our village forgot
to watch where she put her feet.

10:21.426 --> 10:26.890
Stepped on an unexploded
Blu-97 cluster bomb.

10:28.141 --> 10:29.974
<i>The doctors said I was lucky.</i>

10:29.976 --> 10:32.143
<i>I can see how
that would make you angry.</i>

10:32.145 --> 10:35.897
<i>Thank you, I'm glad you understand.</i>

10:35.899 --> 10:40.985
The Serbs took every man and boy from
the village in the woods and shot them.

10:40.987 --> 10:45.656
My brother and I only survived because
we hid in a crawl space under a house.

10:45.658 --> 10:48.868
But it means a lot
that you acknowledge how I feel.

10:48.870 --> 10:50.745
I'm not defending what happened.
You were abandoned...

10:50.747 --> 10:52.330
We were ignored.

10:52.332 --> 10:56.751
The deaths and massacres began,
and the world did nothing.

10:56.753 --> 11:00.254
Perhaps it was easier
because we were Muslim.

11:00.256 --> 11:05.009
Maybe it was felt, on some level,
we deserved it.

11:05.011 --> 11:07.303
I don't know, I don't think so.

11:07.305 --> 11:09.347
But it still wouldn't justify
whatever it is you're planning.

11:09.349 --> 11:12.308
How do you justify
taking lives, Sergeant?

11:12.310 --> 11:14.101
It comes with the job.

11:14.103 --> 11:18.731
But you're not normal military,
are you?

11:18.733 --> 11:21.025
- This is special forces?
- It is what it is.

11:21.027 --> 11:25.949
Of course. And it must be an honor
to be that valued.

11:29.285 --> 11:33.621
But let us be honest,

11:33.623 --> 11:39.295
you only ended up here because
you got your team killed.

11:40.547 --> 11:43.881
He's got access to British
military files.

11:43.883 --> 11:47.428
<i>He' s trying to goad you,
McAllister, don't take the bait.</i>

11:53.643 --> 11:55.226
Why don't you just tell me

11:55.228 --> 11:57.520
what you and bargain basement
Bin Laden are planning,

11:57.522 --> 11:59.897
and then, maybe I'll share
the whole story with you.

11:59.899 --> 12:01.482
I already know the whole story.

12:01.484 --> 12:04.610
You say Zayef is in charge, yeah?
But from what I've seen...

12:04.612 --> 12:07.488
- You've failed upwards, Sergeant.
- Seems unfair to me...

12:07.490 --> 12:10.491
You had a responsibility
to keep your team safe

12:10.493 --> 12:14.287
and you walked them into an ambush
and let them die around you...

12:14.289 --> 12:16.789
<i>You're the one driving the tour bus...</i>

12:16.791 --> 12:20.001
...bleeding out while you climb
over their dead bodies.

12:20.003 --> 12:21.752
Look, this isn't about me,
this is about you...

12:21.754 --> 12:26.551
Fuck their families, as long
as McAllister gets to play soldier...

12:28.011 --> 12:30.678
Bravo One.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.474
Sergeant, respond!

12:36.352 --> 12:39.103
No more bullshit. What's coming?

12:39.105 --> 12:41.647
This is all a game.
Just let it play out.

12:41.649 --> 12:44.319
Wrong answer, dickhead.

12:50.116 --> 12:53.284
Where is it? London? Paris?

12:53.286 --> 12:54.911
- Sir...
- Not now.

12:54.913 --> 12:57.163
Mahir's pendant contained a tracker.

12:57.165 --> 13:00.249
Fuck! We may have been compromised,
prepare to move out.

13:00.251 --> 13:04.047
Madrid? Manchester? Munich?

13:06.674 --> 13:08.510
I'll turn her over.

13:17.644 --> 13:19.352
- Wyatt.
- Yeah?

13:19.354 --> 13:22.190
Vehicle incoming, possible hostiles.

13:45.463 --> 13:49.133
This guy's coming right at us. Go loud!

14:42.645 --> 14:45.315
Shit! They've got a PKM!

15:10.965 --> 15:13.635
- Son of a bitch!
- Fuck!

15:15.470 --> 15:17.053
Boss, we're getting pinned!

15:17.055 --> 15:20.473
You can stop this.
You hand me over to my brother.

15:20.475 --> 15:23.476
Or, I put one bullet in you and another
bullet in your fucking brother

15:23.478 --> 15:25.019
and I end this now.

15:25.021 --> 15:29.148
And while you try, another team
is gunned down around you.

15:29.150 --> 15:31.984
I could use a little back-up out here!

15:31.986 --> 15:35.696
You let me go, your friends live.
That's all there is.

15:35.698 --> 15:39.661
<i>Starting to run out
of fucking ammo here!</i>

15:42.497 --> 15:45.081
<i>A little fucking back-up
would be real good!</i>

15:45.083 --> 15:47.126
<i>They're flanking us!</i>

15:50.713 --> 15:53.923
Cease fire!

15:53.925 --> 15:55.885
Stop firing!

16:01.182 --> 16:03.266
Zayef!

16:03.268 --> 16:07.814
You want your brother, tell your men
to put their fucking weapons down.

16:18.825 --> 16:20.785
Put it down.

16:33.423 --> 16:35.923
Don't fucking move.

16:35.925 --> 16:38.344
Alright, boss?

16:42.223 --> 16:45.016
You've got nothing
to lose here, mate.

16:45.018 --> 16:48.271
- Brother.
- Stay there.

16:55.653 --> 16:57.405
Go on.

17:03.870 --> 17:07.624
- <i>Pick your targets, make them count.</i>
- Solid fucking copy.

17:16.215 --> 17:17.925
Now!

17:23.263 --> 17:24.766
Shit!

17:27.560 --> 17:31.771
Out! Out of ammo
and we need assistance!

17:31.773 --> 17:33.775
I'm out!

17:35.193 --> 17:36.986
Bravos, get down!

17:43.826 --> 17:45.411
Changing!

17:58.341 --> 18:05.054
Come on, don't fuck me now.
Fuck!

18:05.056 --> 18:07.932
Interesting call, Sergeant,
letting him go.

18:07.934 --> 18:11.811
I didn't let him go.
I traded him to save the rest of you.

18:11.813 --> 18:17.275
We don't matter. It's the intel that
counts. The intel that we didn't get!

18:17.277 --> 18:19.443
We have no leads.

18:19.445 --> 18:23.406
All that work, mapping
out networks, chasing up threads...

18:23.408 --> 18:26.661
- it was for nothing.
- We got Munich.

18:28.705 --> 18:32.748
I mentioned a list of possible
locations and Mahir reacted on it.

18:32.750 --> 18:36.377
Reacted like how?
Like, "yeah, that's the place"?

18:36.379 --> 18:39.005
- It was non-verbal.
- Okay.

18:39.007 --> 18:42.675
Sergeant, you were applying force
to the prisoner at the time?

18:42.677 --> 18:45.344
I put him under pressure,
and he gave off cues to the intel.

18:45.346 --> 18:48.681
Probably sound a lot like the same
cues for please stop hitting me.

18:48.683 --> 18:52.101
You lost control, you let your emotions
get the better of you.

18:52.103 --> 18:54.562
And right now, I think you're trying
to find a way to justify that.

18:54.564 --> 18:56.189
I disagree, sir.

18:56.191 --> 19:00.484
I'm really not trying to be a dick here
sir, but I'm grateful we're all alive.

19:00.486 --> 19:03.112
Thanks, kid.

19:03.114 --> 19:06.407
There is a UN security conference
scheduled for Munich tomorrow.

19:06.409 --> 19:09.785
You throw a stone in Europe and
you'll hit some high priority target.

19:09.787 --> 19:12.373
I need more than that.

19:13.625 --> 19:16.542
You get this wrong, it's your career.

19:16.544 --> 19:19.881
So, take a deep breath,
think this through.

19:21.090 --> 19:22.800
Are you sure?

19:33.520 --> 19:35.895
I'm sure, sir.

19:35.897 --> 19:39.482
Lance Corporal, prep a vehicle.
We're heading to Munich.

19:39.484 --> 19:41.484
Yes, sir.

19:41.486 --> 19:44.403
This Imperiya code is a viral device.

19:44.405 --> 19:47.615
Designed to take down
all power and comms.

19:47.617 --> 19:51.911
But it has to be uploaded
into a city's infrastructure.

19:51.913 --> 19:55.039
So, find me possible entry ports.

19:55.041 --> 19:58.543
We could be talking about hundreds
of possibles, in Munich alone.

19:58.545 --> 20:01.005
Well, then, I'd get to work.

20:04.884 --> 20:07.136
I hope you're fucking right.

20:36.958 --> 20:39.834
How did you know where I was?

20:39.836 --> 20:42.712
I had a tracker on you.

20:42.714 --> 20:46.007
I'm sorry, you wanted to stay
with the British army?

20:46.009 --> 20:48.178
No, of course not.

20:49.554 --> 20:52.765
You're my brother.
The only family I have left.

20:54.726 --> 20:57.270
I cannot afford to lose you.

21:13.578 --> 21:17.498
MI6 CACHE STATION,
INNSBRUCK, AUSTRIA

21:27.717 --> 21:31.969
Stock up fast. We move out in fifteen,
make it to Munich within the hour.

21:31.971 --> 21:35.765
Got an old high frequency 320 rig,
hand held radio's.

21:35.767 --> 21:40.019
Got an old everything. What is this,
boss, the antiques roadshow?

21:40.021 --> 21:43.898
Classic never ages, besides it was
the nearest available weapons cache.

21:43.900 --> 21:46.609
So make-do, quickly.

21:46.611 --> 21:49.779
If the Imperiya code gets deployed,
our comms will go down.

21:49.781 --> 21:51.989
I can modify these
high-frequency radio's.

21:51.991 --> 21:54.742
Should work, provided
we're in range of each other.

21:54.744 --> 21:57.078
Very good, get on it.

21:57.080 --> 22:00.623
- Greatest weakness?
- Mate, not now, please.

22:00.625 --> 22:05.628
It's you thinking the boss is right,
that the mission does come first.

22:05.630 --> 22:08.881
And that if Zayef and Mahir
do something, it's all your fault.

22:08.883 --> 22:10.800
Which is?

22:10.802 --> 22:13.469
Each of us would have done
exactly the same as you.

22:13.471 --> 22:17.515
But you didn't, so it's on me. And
telling me I'm wrong isn't helping.

22:17.517 --> 22:21.519
I'm trying to reassure you, okay?
I'm not telling you you're wrong.

22:21.521 --> 22:26.232
And stuffing your pockets with Mafia
cash, that's really reassuring.

22:26.234 --> 22:29.944
I'm trying to support you, asshole.

22:29.946 --> 22:33.992
- What?
- I'm trying to support you, asshole.

22:36.244 --> 22:40.538
- You get my point.
- Yeah. Thanks.

22:40.540 --> 22:45.001
Got a possible location on Zayef, sir.
It's Munich.

22:45.003 --> 22:48.004
Mahir's tracker sends an intermittent
signal back to its monitoring device,

22:48.006 --> 22:50.298
so I traced it.

22:50.300 --> 22:54.427
- Are these Zayef's locations?
- For the past 12 hours, yes.

22:54.429 --> 22:57.013
The denser the circle,
the longer he stayed in that locale,

22:57.015 --> 22:59.599
so there he is,
earlier at the gas station.

22:59.601 --> 23:03.895
And then, a few hours ago, the
Schwarzer Tempel Estate in Munich.

23:03.897 --> 23:07.815
GCS9 has it marked as a possible
hot-spot for insurgent groups.

23:07.817 --> 23:10.526
So, maybe they're looking for back-up,
like local support.

23:10.528 --> 23:13.738
Let's say they are getting outside
support and the target is Munich.

23:13.740 --> 23:16.324
- Who stands to benefit from that?
- That's a long list, sir.

23:16.326 --> 23:19.952
Islamic State, far right groups
looking for a power grab.

23:19.954 --> 23:23.331
You got weapons manufacturers, I mean,
there was a bomb go off in Germany

23:23.333 --> 23:26.250
just to crash the share market, a couple
of years ago. It could be anybody.

23:26.252 --> 23:30.254
We have an ongoing hit, Munich,
downtown commercial district.

23:30.256 --> 23:33.466
Cross-reference the area with access
points to the city's infrastructure.

23:33.468 --> 23:34.844
Sir.

23:39.432 --> 23:43.643
It's the old stock exchange, sir.
It's been closed for renovations,

23:43.645 --> 23:45.770
but the connections will be active
for Imperiya.

23:45.772 --> 23:48.191
Excellent, let's get going.

23:49.359 --> 23:52.695
MUNICH, GERMANY

24:12.632 --> 24:15.466
We believe the target
is a UN Security conference,

24:15.468 --> 24:18.678
this afternoon, at Munich ICM.

24:18.680 --> 24:20.555
Quite the guest list there.

24:20.557 --> 24:24.225
United States Department of Defense,
Vice Chief of the MOD...

24:24.227 --> 24:28.521
Yes, and top level security.
A ring of steel around the venue.

24:28.523 --> 24:31.691
Whatever these boys are planning,
it won't be walking in with a bomb.

24:31.693 --> 24:34.861
Except they have the Russian tech,
they can shut the city down.

24:34.863 --> 24:39.740
Power goes down, comms, trains.
But it's only temporary.

24:39.742 --> 24:43.286
- It hardly worth this helicopter ride.
- You forgot about surveillance, sir.

24:43.288 --> 24:46.372
Power goes down,
you lose surveillance, CCTV.

24:46.374 --> 24:49.250
And already stretched security
gets stretched even further.

24:49.252 --> 24:52.046
Maybe leaving a few holes
in your ring of steel.

24:53.464 --> 24:56.757
Do you have any idea how many
unverified bob threats

24:56.759 --> 24:59.220
the average UN Security
conference gets?

25:00.221 --> 25:03.347
They won't evacuate
without hard evidence.

25:03.349 --> 25:08.436
Or your assurance as deputy head
of the SIS that this threat is real.

25:08.438 --> 25:13.024
We need an armed response if we're to
stop the deployment of Imperiya code.

25:13.026 --> 25:15.693
That'll take time.
I'll need to kick this upstairs.

25:15.695 --> 25:18.154
Of course.

25:18.156 --> 25:20.656
Understood.

25:20.658 --> 25:23.494
You already have something
in motion, don't you?

25:25.288 --> 25:27.663
We won't have time
to clear any of this.

25:27.665 --> 25:31.292
Resignation letters in case
anything should go wrong.

25:31.294 --> 25:33.505
Complete disavowal.

25:49.312 --> 25:52.438
You can't do this
without my permission.

25:52.440 --> 25:56.442
It's already happening.
James, you created Twenty

25:56.444 --> 25:59.779
for "you can't do this" moments
exactly like this one.

25:59.781 --> 26:03.034
We're the blunt instrument
this situation needs.

26:04.160 --> 26:06.996
MUNICH, GERMANY

26:08.540 --> 26:11.332
You took a gamble
on keeping us alive, Sergeant.

26:11.334 --> 26:14.585
This is where we need
that decision to pay off.

26:14.587 --> 26:17.048
Copy that, sir.

26:18.466 --> 26:21.175
Beers and shots by sundown.

26:21.177 --> 26:24.303
My greatest weakness,
I'm secretly an optimist.

26:24.305 --> 26:27.515
- Drinks are on Wyatt, then.
- Not what I said.

26:27.517 --> 26:29.934
He's also secretly an optometrist.

26:29.936 --> 26:34.021
- Good, I was needing my eyes checked.
- That was so bad.

26:34.023 --> 26:37.861
Hey, we get these bastards,
I'll be happy to buy all the drinks.

26:42.156 --> 26:45.577
- See you on the other side, mate.
- Other side, bro.

26:47.287 --> 26:51.541
- McAllister, I'm relying on you.
- Sir.

27:03.803 --> 27:06.598
OLD STOCK EXCHANGE, MUNICH

27:19.527 --> 27:21.944
Alright, through the garage,
make our way down to the basements.

27:21.946 --> 27:25.617
Knock out any access to city systems,
take this place off the grid.

27:27.243 --> 27:29.913
Guess we're not alone.

27:32.457 --> 27:36.920
- How much longer?
- Five, ten minutes.

27:39.130 --> 27:41.382
- Heading left.
- Heading right.

27:47.347 --> 27:51.100
- Novin.
- Chetri, on me.

27:59.776 --> 28:02.487
I'm just pre-loading the code.

28:03.821 --> 28:06.032
You're very good at this.

28:07.951 --> 28:10.495
I'll move our men into position.

28:19.295 --> 28:23.132
Got a call coming from inside the
building. Tracing its destination.

28:24.551 --> 28:26.511
- Send it.
- Done.

28:28.137 --> 28:31.766
We got a location and a phone number.
Turn right here, two blocks down.

28:51.286 --> 28:53.788
Let's call and see who answers.

28:57.709 --> 29:00.001
There, there he is.
Over there, on the right.

29:00.003 --> 29:03.546
Green shirt, back-pack. Plus two.
That's who Zayef was calling.

29:03.548 --> 29:06.176
Follow and watch.

29:16.436 --> 29:18.396
- Chetri?
- Get to cover!

29:23.776 --> 29:25.320
Get down!

29:26.529 --> 29:28.823
Down, Chetri!

29:34.412 --> 29:36.080
Grenade!

29:44.297 --> 29:46.132
Mac!

29:53.640 --> 29:56.474
- You okay?
- I'm good.

29:56.476 --> 29:59.979
- Flank right.
- Copy that. On me.

30:05.026 --> 30:08.778
And here they are,
snapping at our heels.

30:08.780 --> 30:10.573
I need two more minutes.

30:12.367 --> 30:14.410
Stay covered till I call clear.

30:25.839 --> 30:28.049
Chetters!

30:37.725 --> 30:41.143
Clear! Chets, are you good?

30:41.145 --> 30:44.689
- Yeah, I'm fine. Just a scratch.
- Take a fucking moment!

30:44.691 --> 30:46.399
We haven't got a moment, come on.

30:46.401 --> 30:48.234
- Mac, she got tagged!
- I'm okay.

30:48.236 --> 30:50.820
Being okay and dead
is a matter of inches.

30:50.822 --> 30:54.156
Just try and get home
in one fucking piece, alright?

30:54.158 --> 30:56.576
He's right.

30:56.578 --> 30:59.664
- We're against the clock.
- Let's move.

31:01.499 --> 31:04.083
What do you think they've got in the
backpack? They could be suicide vests,

31:04.085 --> 31:07.044
C4, nitro, RDX,
they could have fucking anything.

31:07.046 --> 31:11.340
Whatever it is, we don't want anything
going off in a pedestrian area.

31:11.342 --> 31:14.387
Let's isolate and take down.

31:16.639 --> 31:19.392
Up ahead, main server ducts.

31:20.768 --> 31:22.145
Here!

31:23.563 --> 31:26.939
- Which cable do we cut?
- Fuck! All of them.

31:26.941 --> 31:29.152
Twenty seconds and we're done.

31:34.157 --> 31:36.949
- Right, watch out.
- Go for your life.

31:36.951 --> 31:39.911
4, 3...

31:39.913 --> 31:42.498
2, 1...

31:44.501 --> 31:47.585
- Was that us?
- All the networks are down.

31:47.587 --> 31:51.007
It wasn't us. Imperiya's live!

31:57.096 --> 32:01.182
Shit! The team didn't get
there in time. Bravos?

32:01.184 --> 32:03.809
Fuck! The comms are down.
Alright, plan B.

32:03.811 --> 32:06.898
- We head up and do this the hard way.
- Copy that.

32:08.858 --> 32:10.693
We're gonna have to go on foot.

32:12.278 --> 32:15.448
The UN is four blocks south.

32:19.452 --> 32:21.746
Out of the way!

32:26.209 --> 32:27.961
Move!

32:33.091 --> 32:35.550
What did they promise you?

32:35.552 --> 32:37.345
I don't understand.

32:43.393 --> 32:47.854
- What did they promise you, Mahir?
- Don't know what you're talking about.

32:47.856 --> 32:51.858
Zayef, please.
I did everything to help you.

32:51.860 --> 32:54.151
I don't think so.

32:54.153 --> 32:57.613
Our men are somewhere
near the UN conference now.

32:57.615 --> 33:01.119
The western soldiers engaging them.

33:02.161 --> 33:05.538
And maybe our enemies will succeed.

33:05.540 --> 33:09.709
Maybe they were always
meant to succeed.

33:09.711 --> 33:11.669
Is that the story
you were meant to tell?

33:11.671 --> 33:15.715
- All I ever did was what you wanted.
- You swear this is true?

33:15.717 --> 33:19.512
On the memory of our father,
our mother, I swear.

33:21.890 --> 33:23.766
Okay.

33:34.944 --> 33:37.486
<i>You haven't seen him, he's losing it.</i>

33:37.488 --> 33:39.532
I don't know if I can control him.

33:41.451 --> 33:45.705
<i>Listen to me. This may not
go the way you want.</i>

34:04.474 --> 34:08.601
My whole life has been spent
looking after you.

34:08.603 --> 34:11.813
I made a promise to our parents and...

34:13.190 --> 34:15.608
There's no escaping it.

34:15.610 --> 34:19.487
There is no escaping you!
You and your fucking beliefs.

34:19.489 --> 34:24.617
This life you've made us have.
There's no end to this.

34:24.619 --> 34:28.120
You were my brother and I hated you.

34:28.121 --> 34:32.041
I understand and I'm sorry.

34:32.043 --> 34:36.755
You don't understand.
You think you're this chosen one.

34:38.257 --> 34:43.513
That wasn't by accident. That's what
they wanted you to believe.

34:45.348 --> 34:49.393
You're a puppet who can't see
it's fucking strings.

35:12.083 --> 35:14.335
Eyes on backpack.

35:23.469 --> 35:27.098
- What did they offer you, Mahir?
- A way out.

35:28.266 --> 35:31.686
A fresh start. Without you.

35:33.146 --> 35:36.441
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

35:38.067 --> 35:39.903
That's okay.

35:46.159 --> 35:49.704
The bio weapon. The Russian device.

35:50.663 --> 35:53.124
They were not my plans.

35:54.292 --> 35:58.878
They were your plans. Their plans.

35:58.880 --> 36:03.968
But my plan starts now.

36:15.730 --> 36:19.484
Nothing. He's got nothing.
There's no bomb!

36:28.034 --> 36:29.994
Stop!

36:30.995 --> 36:34.121
Turn around, nice and slow.
Hands on your head.

36:34.123 --> 36:37.836
The bomber is a decoy.
Repeat, the bomber is a decoy.

36:42.799 --> 36:45.218
Shit! It's a bomb-vest. Don't shoot.

36:47.053 --> 36:50.056
Don't fucking move!

36:53.810 --> 36:57.311
Get back. Get back! Move!

36:57.313 --> 37:00.565
Everyone out!

37:00.567 --> 37:03.317
Get down on your knees!

37:03.319 --> 37:05.528
Get out!

37:05.530 --> 37:09.407
- Chetri, clear them out!
- On your knees.

37:09.409 --> 37:12.535
On your fucking knees.

37:12.537 --> 37:15.121
Move! Clear the area.

37:15.123 --> 37:18.499
It doesn't look there's a detonator.
It could still be remotely activated.

37:18.501 --> 37:20.126
We need to get this off and defuse it.

37:20.128 --> 37:23.713
There's tiny locks and fucking
trip wires everywhere.

37:23.715 --> 37:25.423
So, we dig in. One by one.

37:25.425 --> 37:29.302
Who did this. Was this your brother?
Yeah? Where is he?

37:29.304 --> 37:32.471
He was headed towards
the Schwarzer Tempel.

37:32.473 --> 37:35.099
It was all an act, he played us all.

37:35.101 --> 37:38.644
The UN Conference, the bombs,
it was all a decoy...

37:38.646 --> 37:42.732
Thomas, please, you have to help me.
They said they'd get me out of here.

37:42.734 --> 37:45.109
Who's they?
Who are you working with?

37:45.111 --> 37:49.238
Just get this fucking thing
off me, please.

37:49.240 --> 37:52.617
Mac, there's C4, shrapnel packs.

37:52.619 --> 37:55.453
People spilling out of subways,
gridlocked traffic.

37:55.455 --> 37:59.332
If this fucking detonates here...
Come on, Mac.

37:59.334 --> 38:02.335
Alright. Fuck this. We'll get him
back to the Stock Exchange.

38:02.337 --> 38:04.837
If it goes off there, we minimalize
casualties. Get up! Move!

38:04.839 --> 38:08.843
- No, you can't.
- You chose this, you live with it.

38:13.306 --> 38:15.099
They're coming back this way.

38:16.476 --> 38:18.686
Back off!

38:20.647 --> 38:23.648
Fuck! He's activated it.
Let's move!

38:23.650 --> 38:26.569
- Get back!
- Get up!

38:27.820 --> 38:31.322
- Move. I've got it.
- Leave him.

38:31.324 --> 38:33.701
- No.
- Leave him. Come on!

38:39.791 --> 38:43.127
- Alright, go!
- No. No!

38:44.087 --> 38:47.966
Help me. Help me, please.

38:57.725 --> 39:01.396
Bravos, come in. Bravos.

39:23.710 --> 39:27.589
Chetri. Schwarzer Tempel Estate...

39:28.631 --> 39:32.175
That's to the north, right?
Pretty much a straight line.

39:32.177 --> 39:34.844
But emergency services
will be held up.

39:34.846 --> 39:36.723
We need to triage the civilians.

39:40.435 --> 39:43.186
Do what you can.

39:43.188 --> 39:46.439
Kid, let's go.

39:46.441 --> 39:49.609
No, mate. No.

39:49.611 --> 39:52.403
We can't let them get away with this.

39:52.405 --> 39:55.740
Mac, look around you. We lost.

39:55.742 --> 39:59.118
It's too late.
This is where we're needed.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.329
If we hesitate, he'll get away.

40:01.331 --> 40:07.003
It doesn't fucking matter! This is what
matters. Right here! Come on, Mac.

40:09.380 --> 40:14.425
I know. I'm sorry. I have to do this.

40:14.427 --> 40:16.471
Mac.

40:27.357 --> 40:31.694
SCHWARZER TEMPEL
ESTATE, MUNICH

40:51.589 --> 40:54.382
Comms check, Zero, come in.

40:54.384 --> 40:56.344
Fuck!

41:53.610 --> 41:56.946
Zero, come in. Fuck.

42:33.900 --> 42:37.695
- Comms bad. Repeat.
- <i>Bravo One. Sit' rep'.</i>

42:39.989 --> 42:43.908
Schwarzer Tempel Estate.
Contact. Multiple hostiles.

42:43.910 --> 42:46.536
<i>Hold and wait.</i>

42:46.538 --> 42:48.621
We wait, we're gonna lose him.

42:48.623 --> 42:52.375
<i>Bravo One, listen to me.
We're on our way. ETA five minutes.</i>

42:52.377 --> 42:55.088
I'm moving to engage.

44:29.557 --> 44:34.519
<i>Bravo One, we're en route.
You better not be fucking engaging.</i>

44:34.521 --> 44:38.689
You know me, mate,
I'm just taking it easy.

44:38.691 --> 44:40.944
<i>Five minutes.</i>

44:43.029 --> 44:47.865
The boss said five minutes two minutes
ago. Who's driving, you or Novin?

44:47.867 --> 44:49.869
<i>Me. I'm driving.</i>

44:52.580 --> 44:55.124
Five minutes, my ass.

44:56.876 --> 45:00.880
- Like I said, this is on me, mate.
- <i>McAllister, don't...</i>

45:06.344 --> 45:08.888
Wyatt?

45:10.974 --> 45:13.432
Hands.

45:13.434 --> 45:15.812
Okay. Go.

45:51.181 --> 45:53.474
What the fuck are you doing here?

46:33.932 --> 46:37.850
Man down...

46:37.852 --> 46:42.482
Block C, third floor... Zayef.

46:56.287 --> 46:59.916
<i>I suppose I've always wanted
to make a difference.</i>

47:01.167 --> 47:05.586
<i>I said I'll stick this out as long
as there's something to fight for.</i>

47:05.588 --> 47:10.635
<i>And... I don't know,
you know, you look around and...</i>

47:11.594 --> 47:16.599
There's always something
worth fighting for. And...

47:17.642 --> 47:19.894
I think I'm alright with that.

47:23.398 --> 47:28.486
Shit, sorry, I forgot the question.
Is that enough? Will that do?
