WEBVTT

00:05.000 --> 00:08.233
MAN, THIS BASKETBALL
IS CHEAP.

00:08.233 --> 00:10.867
IT AIN'T COMING BACK.

00:11.934 --> 00:14.233
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?
MOM GOT IT FREE

00:14.233 --> 00:18.100
WHEN SHE BOUGHT
THE FAMILY-SIZE CHEESE
AT CHEAP CHARLIE'S.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.133
YEAH, I GUESS
I SHOULDN'T COMPLAIN.

00:20.133 --> 00:24.834
WE WOULDN'T HAVE SKATEBOARDS
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT SALE
ON MAYONNAISE.

00:24.834 --> 00:26.800
MOSEBY.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.600
AH, YOUNG MR. CAVENAUGH.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.100
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN QUITE A WHILE.

00:31.100 --> 00:32.400
WHERE'S MY MOM?

00:32.400 --> 00:34.934
YOUR MOTHER'S
CHARITY LUNCHEON
IS STILL IN SESSION.

00:34.934 --> 00:36.600
THEY'RE DEBATING
THE HEALTH BENEFITS

00:36.600 --> 00:38.800
OF GREEN TEA
VERSUS CHAMOMILE.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.734
HOPE THINGS DON'T
COME TO A BOIL.

00:42.767 --> 00:45.200
NEVER MIND.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.500
MR. MOSEBY, THINK YOU COULD
OPEN THE ICE CREAM BAR

00:48.500 --> 00:49.867
A BIT EARLY TODAY?

00:49.867 --> 00:51.600
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
THERE IS NO--

00:51.600 --> 00:53.000
I COULD GO
FOR AN ICE CREAM.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.400
CONSIDER IT OPEN.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.567
LET ME CALL OUR FROZEN
CONFECTIONS ENGINEER.

00:58.567 --> 01:00.400
THANKS, MAN.
THAT WAS AWESOME.

01:00.400 --> 01:01.867
YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE?

01:01.867 --> 01:04.033
YEAH. A BASKETBALL
THAT COMES BACK UP

01:04.033 --> 01:06.367
AFTER IT HITS THE GROUND.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.500
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
COME BACK TO MY PLACE?

01:08.500 --> 01:11.133
I'VE GOT DOZENS
OF BASKETBALLS
AND A REGULATION COURT.

01:11.133 --> 01:14.100
YOU HAVE
A BASKETBALL COURT
OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE?

01:14.100 --> 01:17.033
INSIDE, RIGHT NEXT
TO THE BOWLING ALLEY.

01:17.033 --> 01:19.900
TELL MOM
I'M TAKING THE CAR.

01:19.900 --> 01:21.967
YOU HAVE A CAR?

01:21.967 --> 01:23.967
WELL, IF YOU CONSIDER
A STRETCH LIMO

01:23.967 --> 01:27.133
WITH A HOT TUB
AND A BIG-SCREEN TV
A CAR, THEN YEAH.

01:27.133 --> 01:31.033

THE RESPONSIBILITY
THAT COMES WITH PARENTHOOD.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.400
IN PREPARATION...

02:24.400 --> 02:27.600
THIS WEEKEND EACH OF YOU
WILL BE TAKING CARE

02:27.600 --> 02:29.100
OF ONE OF THESE.

02:29.100 --> 02:30.800
WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF A DOLL?

02:30.800 --> 02:32.367
OH, NOT A DOLL.

02:32.367 --> 02:35.100
THIS IS A HIGH-TECH
BABY SIMULATOR.

02:35.100 --> 02:38.967
IT MUST BE FED,
CHANGED, AND NURTURED.

02:38.967 --> 02:41.367
JUST LIKE A REAL BABY.

02:41.367 --> 02:43.800
AND IF YOU DON'T,
IT WILL CRY,

02:43.800 --> 02:45.567
AND I WILL KNOW.

02:45.567 --> 02:48.100
YOU MEAN...

02:49.133 --> 02:53.233
NO, DEAR. THERE'S
A RECORDER INSIDE.

02:53.233 --> 02:55.700
NOW, EACH OF YOU
WILL BE PAIRED

02:55.700 --> 02:57.000
WITH A PARTNER.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.300
OOH, CAN
I HAVE LONDON?

02:58.300 --> 02:59.767
OOH, NO.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.967
I DEAL WITH BABIES
ALL THE TIME.

03:02.967 --> 03:05.200
THIS WILL BE A CINCH.
HELLO, "A."

03:05.200 --> 03:08.500
LONDON, YOU WILL BE
PARTNERED WITH MADDIE.

03:08.500 --> 03:10.100
GOOD-BYE, "A."

03:10.100 --> 03:12.600
IT'S SO CUTE.

03:12.600 --> 03:17.700
WOW. I'M STARTING
TO FEEL MOTHERLY
MATERNAL-TYPE FEELINGS.

03:17.700 --> 03:19.000
[CRYING]

03:19.000 --> 03:20.600
IT WANTS YOU.

03:31.467 --> 03:33.867
GREAT GAME, ZACK.
YOU'RE AN AWESOME PLAYER.

03:33.867 --> 03:35.200
THANKS.

03:35.200 --> 03:39.000
WELL, I WOULD'VE DONE BETTER,
BUT MY GEL INSOLES WERE LEAKING.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.800
COOL. SLOT CARS.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.500
WOW. THESE TREES
ARE SO LIFE-LIKE.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.000
ARE THOSE DOUGLAS FIR?

03:48.000 --> 03:51.500
NO. THEY'RE EVEN MORE RARE.
THEY'RE PLASTIC.

03:52.567 --> 03:55.400
MAN, ZACK, YOU'RE
TEARING UP THE TRACK.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.300
THANKS.
IT'S ALL IN THE FINGER.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.200
CODY, WHY ARE YOU
DRIVING SO SLOW?

04:03.200 --> 04:06.967
WELL, I DON'T WANNA
EXCEED THE SPEED LIMIT.

04:06.967 --> 04:09.200
YEAH, YOU WOULDN'T WANNA
DO THAT IN A TOY RACE CAR.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.700
YOU MIGHT GET STOPPED
BY A TOY COP.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.767
A TOY COP.
MAN, THAT'S CLASSIC.

04:13.767 --> 04:15.467
HEY, ZACK, CAN YOU
GRAB ME A SODA?

04:15.467 --> 04:16.600
YEAH. WHERE?

04:16.600 --> 04:18.000
SODA FOUNTAIN.

04:18.967 --> 04:21.834
OH, MY.

04:21.834 --> 04:24.100
HE HAS A SODA FOUNTAIN
IN HIS ROOM.

04:24.100 --> 04:26.200
Cody: DO YOU HAVE
PASSION FRUIT TEA?

04:26.200 --> 04:30.300
NO. AND I DON'T HAVE
RICE CAKES EITHER.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.233
HERE YOU GO.

04:33.233 --> 04:36.467
OOH, AND I THREW IN
A SPRITZ OF VANILLA FOR YOU.

04:36.467 --> 04:37.500
THANKS.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.200
WHOA.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.400
YOU GOT THE ZEDTEK
GAME SYSTEM?

04:41.400 --> 04:44.500
YEAH. YOU WANT IT?
I DON'T PLAY IT MUCH ANYMORE

04:44.500 --> 04:46.867
NOW THAT I'VE GOT
THE ZED 2 IN MY DEN.

04:46.867 --> 04:49.000
THANKS, MAN.
YOU'RE AWESOME.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.600
HEY, COOL SKATEBOARD.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.934
TAKE IT.
I GOT 15 JUST LIKE IT.

04:54.934 --> 04:57.500
YOU WANNA GO TRY IT OUT
ON THE VERT RAMP I GOT
IN THE BACKYARD?

04:57.500 --> 04:58.967
SURE.

04:58.967 --> 05:01.400
I'VE GOT TO GO WORK
ON MY SPEECH.

05:02.967 --> 05:05.600
BUT YOU GUYS GO AHEAD.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.600
I GOT TO HIT
THE LIBRARY ANYWAY.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.500
I'M REPRESENTING
THE EIGHTH GRADE
IN A BIG COMPETITION.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.600
SO YOU TWO GO GET
YOUR EXERCISE.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.100
I'LL BE FLEXING
THE OLD COCONUT.

05:20.967 --> 05:23.400
OH, WHAT
A BEAUTIFUL BABY.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.967
WHO'S THE MOMMY?

05:24.967 --> 05:26.767
Both: WE ARE.

05:27.734 --> 05:29.233
IT'S A DOLL.

05:29.233 --> 05:31.300
WE'RE PRACTICING WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO BE PARENTS
FOR HEALTH CLASS.

05:31.300 --> 05:33.500
I KNOW ALL ABOUT
BEING A PARENT.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.934
I REMEMBER WHEN DUDLEY
TOOK HIS FIRST STEPS.

05:35.934 --> 05:38.834
DUDLEY'S YOUR PET CHICKEN.

05:38.834 --> 05:42.000
AND I REMEMBER
HIS FIRST WORDS, TOO.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.667
BAWK-BAWK-BAWK,
BAWK! BAWK! BAWK!

05:44.667 --> 05:47.100
BAWK!

05:47.100 --> 05:48.500
WHAT A SMART CHICKEN.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.734
I KNOW. ISN'T HE?

05:53.800 --> 05:57.567
TIME TO GO SHOPPING
FOR LONDON, JR.

05:57.567 --> 05:59.233
WE ARE NOT CALLING IT
LONDON, JR.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.200
WHY NOT?

06:00.200 --> 06:02.600
UH, BECAUSE HE'S A BOY.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.900
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

06:03.900 --> 06:07.600
UH, BECAUSE
I'VE BEEN THE ONE
CHANGING HIS DIAPERS.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.567
DON'T YOU THINK WE
SHOULD BE DIVIDING UP
THE RESPONSIBILITIES?

06:10.567 --> 06:13.400
WE ARE. YOU TAKE CARE OF HIM
AND I BUY HIM STUFF.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.700
YAY, LONDON, JR.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.000
[CRYING]

06:16.000 --> 06:17.834
THAT'S NOT HIS NAME.

06:17.834 --> 06:18.834
[CRYING]

06:18.834 --> 06:20.200
NOW LOOK WHAT YOU DID.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.400
ME?

06:21.400 --> 06:24.567
LADIES, WHY DO YOU
HAVE A CRYING BABY
IN MY LOBBY?

06:24.567 --> 06:26.567
IT'S NOT A BABY. IT'S
OUR HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT.

06:26.567 --> 06:29.200
IS THERE ANY WAY YOU
CAN GET YOUR HOMEWORK
ASSIGNMENT TO SHUT UP?

06:29.200 --> 06:30.667
WE'RE TRYING.

06:30.667 --> 06:33.367
SHE'S CRYING BECAUSE MADDIE
WOKE HIM UP BY YELLING.

06:33.367 --> 06:35.600
OR MAYBE HE'S CRYING
BECAUSE YOU REFUSE

06:35.600 --> 06:37.600
TO FEED, CHANGE,
OR TOUCH HIM.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.967
HELLO. MANICURE.

06:38.967 --> 06:41.200
JUST GIVE ME THAT.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.467
HOW DO YOU TURN
THE THING OFF?

06:43.467 --> 06:45.500
OH!

06:45.500 --> 06:47.467
[CRYING]

06:47.467 --> 06:49.567
HE'S NOT A REAL BABY.

06:49.567 --> 06:51.567
TRUST ME.
I LOVE CHILDREN.

06:51.567 --> 06:54.800
LET ME HOLD YOUR BABY!

06:58.967 --> 07:01.467
HEY, CODY, WANNA
GO SEE A MOVIE?

07:01.467 --> 07:03.500
<i>KILLER KOALA </i>
<i>OPENED DOWNTOWN. </i>

07:03.500 --> 07:05.000
I DON'T KNOW.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.900
I REALLY GOT TO WORK
ON MY SPEECH.

07:06.900 --> 07:08.767
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

07:08.767 --> 07:11.233
FIRST PRIZE
IS A GOLDEN TONGUE.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.000
COME ON.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.600
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CUTE,
FURRY, WOODLAND CREATURES

07:16.600 --> 07:19.400
WREAKING HAVOC
ON AN UNSUSPECTING PUBLIC.

07:20.934 --> 07:23.800
WELL, I GUESS
A BREAK WON'T HURT.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.300
I'LL GO GRAB MY TURTLENECK

07:25.300 --> 07:28.367
SO I CAN HIDE MY EYES
DURING THE SCARY PARTS.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.200
[KNOCKING]

07:30.200 --> 07:31.100
COME IN.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.734
OH, HEY, THEO, WHAT'S UP?

07:33.734 --> 07:36.700
I GOT 2 TICKETS
FOR THE CELTICS GAME.
WANNA GO?

07:36.700 --> 07:39.033
2 TICKETS, HUH?

07:40.400 --> 07:43.200
WELL, CODY AND I WERE GOING
TO SEE <i>KILLER KOALA. </i>

07:43.200 --> 07:46.200
SAW IT. HE WAS FRAMED
BY THE PLATYPUS.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.567
THESE ARE FLOOR SEATS.

07:48.567 --> 07:49.834
ARE YOU KIDDING?

07:49.834 --> 07:51.834
CLOSE ENOUGH
FOR THEM TO SWEAT ON US?

07:51.834 --> 07:53.200
AND IF WE'RE LUCKY, BLEED.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.767
OK, I'M IN.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.500
HEY, ZACK, I BROUGHT
MY SWEATER WITH THE BIG POCKETS

07:59.500 --> 08:02.500
SO WE CAN BRING OUR OWN
POPCORN AND SAVE MONEY, TOO.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.033
OH, HI, THEO.

08:05.033 --> 08:07.300
YEAH, ABOUT THAT.
CHANGE OF PLANS.

08:07.300 --> 08:09.467
THEO'S GOT TICKETS
TO THE CELTICS GAME.

08:09.467 --> 08:12.367
OH, COOL. I'LL GO GRAB
MY "DEFENSE" SIGN.

08:12.367 --> 08:17.133
IT'S A CAPITAL "D"
AND THEN A PICKET FENCE.

08:17.133 --> 08:19.200
I ONLY HAVE 2 TICKETS.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.367
BUT YOU WOULD'VE
BEEN MY THIRD CHOICE.

08:21.367 --> 08:23.300
BUT YOU HAVE TO DO
YOUR SPEECH THING,

08:23.300 --> 08:24.767
SO IT'S COOL, RIGHT?

08:24.767 --> 08:26.967
UH, YEAH. I GUESS SO.

08:26.967 --> 08:29.367
COME ON, ZACK.
WE DON'T WANNA
MISS SHOOTAROUND.

08:29.367 --> 08:32.100
I GOT TO TELL MY MOM.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.200
WANT MY D-FENCE SIGN?

08:34.200 --> 08:38.100
THAT'S OK. I'VE ALREADY
GOT MY "I'M A DORK"
T-SHIRT IN THE CAR.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.667
SO, FELLOW AMERICANS,

08:43.667 --> 08:45.934
LOOK IN THE MIRROR
AND ASK YOURSELF,

08:45.934 --> 08:47.500
"AM I HAPPY?"

08:47.500 --> 08:48.500
LIKE IT?

08:48.500 --> 08:50.800
HMM?

08:50.800 --> 08:52.367
GUESS NOT.

08:52.367 --> 08:55.100
I'M SORRY, CODY.
IT'S JUST THAT I'M EXHAUSTED.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.567
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT
TAKING CARE OF THE BABY.

08:57.567 --> 09:00.400
WHAT BABY? I DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW YOU GOT MARRIED.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.133
PLEASE, CODY, I'M ONLY 16,

09:03.133 --> 09:05.600
AND I'VE NEVER
EVEN KISSED A BOY.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.834
OH, PLEASE.
SAVE IT FOR THE NUNS.

09:08.834 --> 09:10.934
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE BABY SIMULATOR

09:10.934 --> 09:12.867
LONDON AND I HAVE TO TAKE
CARE OF FOR HEALTH CLASS.

09:12.867 --> 09:14.867
THANK GOODNESS
SHE'S FINALLY HELPING OUT.

09:14.867 --> 09:17.300
MADDIE, I BOUGHT
LONDON, JR.

09:17.300 --> 09:20.867
THE MOST ADORABLE
CASHMERE SWEATER.

09:20.867 --> 09:25.100
IT'S WHAT ALL THE BEST-DRESSED
BABY SIMULATORS ARE WEARING.

09:25.967 --> 09:27.767
I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE BIG,

09:27.767 --> 09:29.500
BUT I FIGURE
HE'LL GROW INTO IT.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.000
OK. 2 THINGS.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.500
1--HE'S A DOLL.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.600
HE'S NOT GROWING
INTO ANYTHING.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.400
2--WHERE IS HE?

09:39.400 --> 09:43.033
CALM DOWN. HE'S FINE.
HE'S WITH THE NANNY.

09:43.033 --> 09:46.000
NANNY? YOU LEFT OUR BABY
WITH A NANNY?

09:46.000 --> 09:49.400
WHAT? I HAD 22 NANNIES,
AND I TURNED OUT JUST FINE.

09:49.400 --> 09:52.600
LONDON, YOU'RE MISSING
THE WHOLE POINT
OF THE ASSIGNMENT.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.834
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE TAKING CARE
OF THE BABY OURSELVES

09:54.834 --> 09:56.200
TO LEARN RESPONSIBILITY.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.867
BUT I AM BEING RESPONSIBLE.

09:57.867 --> 10:00.467
I INSTALLED A NANNY CAM
ON THE STROLLER.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.467
DON'T YOU WANT
YOUR BABA?

10:05.467 --> 10:08.100
LOOK. NANNY ESTEBAN
LIKES IT.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.600
[CRYING]

10:18.200 --> 10:20.600
ESTEBAN IS OUR NANNY?

10:20.600 --> 10:23.700
THE MAN'S BEST FRIEND
IS POULTRY.

10:25.133 --> 10:28.200
HEY, GUYS, WE'RE HERE
FOR OUR PLAYDATE.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.300
LONDON, I NAMED
MY SON AFTER YOU.

10:32.300 --> 10:35.200
FOR THE LAST TIME,
HIS NAME IS LEBRON.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.834
AND GUESS WHAT.
YOU'RE THE GODMOTHER.

10:38.834 --> 10:40.100
OH!

10:41.200 --> 10:44.300
GODMOTHER? SHE CAN'T EVEN
MOTHER HER OWN CHILD.

10:44.300 --> 10:46.300
SHE HANDED HIM OFF
TO A NANNY.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.567
OOH, IS SHE GOOD?
CAN I HAVE HER NUMBER?

10:49.867 --> 10:51.367
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

10:51.367 --> 10:53.700
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
THE ONES TAKING CARE OF HIM.

10:53.700 --> 10:55.600
BUT I AM TAKING
CARE OF HIM.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.567
I DIDN'T SEE YOU
STARTING A TRUST FUND.

10:58.567 --> 11:00.500
ESTEBAN, PLEASE BRING
OVER THAT SUITCASE.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.867
BUT I'M WITH CHILD.

11:01.867 --> 11:03.900
GET OVER HERE
WITH THAT SUITCASE

11:03.900 --> 11:06.600
IF YOU WANNA BE
WITH PAYCHECK.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.033
OH, RIGHT AWAY, MR. MOSEBY.

11:10.300 --> 11:13.934
NO!
NO!

11:21.667 --> 11:23.400
ARE YOU OK?

11:23.400 --> 11:24.734
THANKS. I'M FINE.

11:24.734 --> 11:28.100
NOT YOU. THE HAIR
TO THE TIPTON FORTUNE.

11:28.100 --> 11:29.300
IT'S "HEIR."

11:29.300 --> 11:31.367
AND HE'S FINE,
NO THANKS TO YOU.

11:31.367 --> 11:34.000
SO YOU STILL THINK
A NANNY'S A GOOD IDEA?

11:34.000 --> 11:35.900
ESTEBAN, YOU'RE FIRED.

11:35.900 --> 11:37.000
AS THE NANNY
OR AS THE BELLBOY?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
AS THE NANNY.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.200
BUT THE DAY IS YOUNG.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.100
I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU.

11:42.100 --> 11:45.100
YOU HAVE THE PARENTING
SKILLS OF A TOASTER.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.367
TONIGHT I AM GOING
TO STAY WITH YOU

11:47.367 --> 11:49.467
AND MAKE SURE YOU START
PULLING YOUR WEIGHT
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP

11:49.467 --> 11:50.734
AND TAKE CARE OF OUR BABY.

11:50.734 --> 11:53.700
I'M NOT GONNA LET
YOUR BAD PARENTING
COST ME A GRADE.

11:53.700 --> 11:56.133
OK, BUT AFTER WE GET
OUR "A" ON THIS ASSIGNMENT,

11:56.133 --> 11:57.500
I WANT A DIVORCE.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.700
FINE.

11:58.700 --> 11:59.867
FINE.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.800
SO HOW WAS THE GAME?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.500
AH, NOTHING SPECIAL.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.300
REALLY? 'CAUSE I LISTENED
TO IT ON THE RADIO,

12:19.300 --> 12:22.033
AND THE CELTICS WON
ON A 65-FOOT SHOT

12:22.033 --> 12:24.000
IN DOUBLE OVERTIME.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.934
HO-HUM.

12:27.367 --> 12:30.300
SO HOW IS THE SPEECH
THING COMING?

12:30.300 --> 12:33.734
YOU'LL HEAR MONDAY NIGHT.

12:33.734 --> 12:35.934
OOH, IS IT THIS MONDAY?

12:35.934 --> 12:37.500
IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

12:37.500 --> 12:40.600
IT'S BEEN UP ON
THE FRIDGE FOR 3 WEEKS.

12:40.600 --> 12:43.133
WELL, THIS MONDAY
THEO'S GOT TICKETS

12:43.133 --> 12:45.133
TO THE BLACK EYED PEAS
CONCERT.

12:45.133 --> 12:47.200
HE AND THE PEAS
GO WAY BACK.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.934
HE KNEW THEM
WHEN THEY WERE THE PODS.

12:50.967 --> 12:53.100
BUT I'LL BRING YOU BACK
A FERGIE BOBBLEHEAD.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.500
DON'T BOTHER.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.700
HAVE FUN WITH YOUR
NEW BEST FRIEND.

12:56.700 --> 12:59.900
AW, COME ON, BUDDY,
DON'T BE LIKE THAT.

12:59.900 --> 13:02.500
CODY, BONE FINGER?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.800
OW.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.800
OK, THE BOTTLE AND
THE MILK ARE HEATED UP.

13:16.800 --> 13:17.900
NOW CAN I FEED HIM?

13:17.900 --> 13:20.100
NO. FIRST YOU HAVE
TO TEST IT ON SKIN.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.667
OH.

13:25.567 --> 13:28.200
IS IT OK?

13:28.200 --> 13:30.467
IT'S FINE.

13:30.467 --> 13:32.767
JUST FEED HIM.

13:32.767 --> 13:36.500
SISTER DOMINICK HAD
TO PAIR ME WITH YOU. DARN NUN.

13:36.500 --> 13:37.834
THERE. I SAID IT.

13:37.834 --> 13:41.400
I CURSED A NUN,
AND I DON'T CARE. DARN NUN.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.600
[CRYING]

13:42.600 --> 13:44.667
WHY IS HE CRYING NOW?

13:44.667 --> 13:46.500
WELL, HE PROBABLY HAS GAS.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.700
BABIES NEED TO BE BURPED
TO GET THE AIR OUT.

13:48.700 --> 13:50.200
YOU HAVE TO LIGHTLY
TAP HIM ON HIS BACK.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.967
OH.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.400
[GASPS] HEY,
HE STOPPED CRYING.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.600
I DID IT. YAY, ME.

14:01.800 --> 14:05.600
REMIND ME NOT TO ASK YOU
TO CHANGE HIS DIAPER.

14:07.967 --> 14:10.500
HEY, CODY,
HOW'S THE SPEECH COMING?

14:10.500 --> 14:11.667
GREAT. THANKS.

14:11.667 --> 14:14.567
I'VE GOT 3 METAPHORS,
2 ANALOGIES, AND A SIMILE.

14:14.567 --> 14:18.300
I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR IT.
I'M A SUCKER
FOR A GOOD SIMILE.

14:18.300 --> 14:22.000
I'M GLAD SOMEONE
WILL BE THERE
BECAUSE ZACK'S TOO BUSY.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.900
HE ONLY HAS TIME
FOR THEO NOW.

14:24.900 --> 14:26.834
EVER SINCE HE STARTED
HANGING OUT WITH THAT GUY,

14:26.834 --> 14:28.934
HE'S BECOME
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

14:28.934 --> 14:31.500
HONEY, I THINK YOU'RE
EXAGGERATING A LITTLE BIT.

14:32.934 --> 14:36.567
HEY, MOM, HAVE YOU
SEEN MY GOLD WATCH
WITH THE DIAMOND ACCENTS?

14:36.567 --> 14:38.400
WE NEED TO TALK.

14:38.400 --> 14:39.800
YOU BET WE DO.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.800
CODY, GO TO YOUR ROOM.
WORK ON YOUR SPEECH.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.000
FINE.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.600
BUT THE MUSE IS GONE.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.600
WHAT IS THIS? YOU'RE NOT
COMING TO CODY'S SPEECH?

14:49.600 --> 14:53.200
I GOT PLANS.
THEO AND I ARE GOING
TO SEE A CONCERT TONIGHT.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.233
BUT HE'S BEEN TO ALL
THE SPECIAL EVENTS
IN YOUR LIFE.

14:56.233 --> 14:58.767
HE SITS THERE AND WATCHES
ALL YOUR BASKETBALL GAMES,
ALL YOUR BASEBALL GAMES--

14:58.767 --> 15:01.200
HE'S ON THE TEAM.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.200
YEAH, BUT HE NEVER PLAYS.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.200
AND HE GAVE YOU
A STANDING OVATION

15:05.200 --> 15:09.100
WHEN YOU WON THE AWARD
FOR MOST IMPROVED
IN REMEDIAL MATH.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.133
IT'S JUST ONE SPEECH, MOM.

15:11.133 --> 15:13.900
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
I TOLD HIM I'D BRING HIM
BACK A BOBBLEHEAD.

15:13.900 --> 15:16.967
HE CAN'T BE BOUGHT
WITH A BOBBLEHEAD.

15:16.967 --> 15:20.000
NOW, MATERIAL THINGS
WILL NOT SOLVE
ALL YOUR PROBLEMS.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.600
WORKS FOR THEO.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.800
I HAD A BOYFRIEND ONCE.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.300
OH, NO. HERE IT COMES.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.567
HE USED TO SHOWER ME
WITH STUFF--

15:29.567 --> 15:32.600
RINGS, BRACELETS,
NECKLACES,

15:32.600 --> 15:34.100
CLOTHES, SHOES--

15:34.100 --> 15:36.567
AND THERE WAS THIS
ONE PAIR OF EARRINGS--

15:36.567 --> 15:38.300
MOM--
SORRY.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.834
ONE DAY I REALIZED
I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE HIM.

15:41.834 --> 15:44.100
WHAT I REALLY LIKED
WERE THE THINGS HE GAVE ME.

15:44.100 --> 15:45.500
SO YOU BROKE UP WITH HIM?

15:45.500 --> 15:46.967
NO. HE DUMPED ME.

15:46.967 --> 15:49.100
BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

15:49.100 --> 15:52.400
THE POINT IS,
YOUR FRIENDSHIP
SHOULDN'T BE FOR SALE.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.834
SO ARE YOU SAYING
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME
MISS THE CONCERT

15:54.834 --> 15:56.600
AND GO TO CODY'S SPEECH?

15:56.600 --> 16:00.500
NO. BUT WHILE YOU'RE
DISAPPOINTING YOUR BROTHER,

16:00.500 --> 16:03.400
I WANT YOU TO THINK
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
THEO IS A REAL FRIEND.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.567
SO I CAN GO TO THE CONCERT?

16:04.567 --> 16:06.100
IF YOU THINK THAT'S
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

16:06.100 --> 16:07.200
SO I CAN GO TO THE CONCERT?

16:07.200 --> 16:08.400
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.400
SO I CAN GO TO THE CONCERT?

16:09.400 --> 16:10.834
IF YOU CAN LIVE
WITH YOURSELF.

16:10.834 --> 16:12.300
I CAN.
OK.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.100
I'M GOING.
THEN GO.

16:14.100 --> 16:15.567
ALL RIGHT.

16:15.567 --> 16:18.700
BUT...
WHILE YOU'RE GOING,

16:18.700 --> 16:21.233
YOU THINK ABOUT YOU'RE
DISAPPOINTING YOUR BRO--

16:21.233 --> 16:24.233
I HAVE GOT TO GET BETTER
AT THIS GUILT THING.

16:26.233 --> 16:28.400
[CRYING]

16:28.400 --> 16:31.600
[BOTH GROANING]

16:31.600 --> 16:35.200
MADDIE, BABY.

16:35.200 --> 16:38.300
LONDON, YOUR TURN.

16:38.300 --> 16:41.133
I'LL GIVE YOU
A HUNDRED BUCKS.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.867
I AM SO TIRED,

16:42.867 --> 16:45.300
NO AMOUNT OF MONEY
COULD GET ME UP.

16:45.300 --> 16:46.300
A THOUSAND?

16:46.300 --> 16:48.000
RISE AND SHINE.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.700
[CRYING]

16:49.700 --> 16:51.133
OH, OH, OH, OH.

16:51.133 --> 16:53.300
HERE. NOW, PAY UP.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.033
IT'S OK, LONDON, JR.

16:56.033 --> 16:57.600
DON'T CRY.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.500
I DON'T THINK ASKING HIM
IS GOING TO HELP.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.900
HE'S BEEN CRYING
FOR 2 DAYS STRAIGHT.

17:01.900 --> 17:02.934
HERE.

17:02.934 --> 17:05.200
GET THE PACIFIER.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.700
[BOTH SIGH]

17:09.700 --> 17:12.567
[CRYING]

17:12.567 --> 17:14.000
NOW WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.767
I DON'T KNOW.
DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS?

17:15.767 --> 17:19.033
I MEAN BESIDES
THE SWISS BOARDING SCHOOL.

17:19.033 --> 17:20.967
[KNOCKING]

17:22.500 --> 17:24.467
LADIES, I AM GETTING
ALL SORTS OF COMPLAINTS.

17:24.467 --> 17:25.967
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

17:25.967 --> 17:27.033
HE WON'T STOP CRYING.

17:27.033 --> 17:28.834
FINE. THEN I'LL
TEAR OUT ITS BATTERIES.

17:28.834 --> 17:31.700
DON'T YOU TOUCH OUR BABY.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.567
HE'S A DOLL.

17:33.567 --> 17:34.767
YOU BET HE IS,

17:34.767 --> 17:37.000
AND YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING
A HAIR ON HIS WITTLE HEAD.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.834
IT'S NOT THE HAIR
ON HIS WITTLE HEAD.

17:39.834 --> 17:41.734
IT'S JUST
MAKING IT WORSE.

17:41.734 --> 17:42.867
JUST GIVE HIM TO ME.

17:42.867 --> 17:44.500
GIVE HIM TO ME.
HE WANTS HIS MOMMY.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.100
I'M HIS MOMMY, TOO.

17:46.100 --> 17:48.567
I BUY NICER THINGS.
HE LIKES ME MORE.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.200
HE LIKES ME MORE.
I ACTUALLY TAKE CARE OF HIM.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.667
YOU'RE HURTING HIM.
YOU'RE HURTING HIM.

17:53.667 --> 17:56.000
JUST LET GO.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.400
[WHOOSH]

18:05.700 --> 18:08.767
I MISS THAT LITTLE BABY.
HE WAS SO CUTE.

18:08.767 --> 18:12.000
ALTHOUGH THE CRYING
GAVE ME A HEADACHE.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.500
GOOD-BYE,
MY LITTLE LONDON.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.800
FOR THE LAST TIME,
HIS NAME IS LEBRON.

18:32.300 --> 18:36.900
WHAT DID YOU DO,
PLAY HOCKEY WITH THIS BABY?

18:38.734 --> 18:42.200
NO. HE FELL OUT
OF A WINDOW.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.867
WE KIND OF GOT
IN A LITTLE ARGUMENT
OVER OUR PARENTING STYLES.

18:45.867 --> 18:49.200
I GUESS WE GOT
SO CAUGHT UP ARGUING
THAT WE FORGOT ABOUT THE BABY.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.200
WE WERE BOTH PROBABLY
A LITTLE IRRITABLE

18:51.200 --> 18:53.367
'CAUSE WE HADN'T
SLEPT FOR 2 DAYS.

18:53.367 --> 18:56.900
AND THE BABY DIDN'T
STOP CRYING THE WHOLE TIME.

18:56.900 --> 18:58.834
UNTIL HE HIT THE GROUND.

18:58.834 --> 19:00.834
THE TRUTH IS,

19:00.834 --> 19:03.500
WE JUST COULDN'T
HANDLE IT.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.700
WE'RE NOT READY
TO BE PARENTS.

19:05.700 --> 19:07.800
SO JUST GO AHEAD
AND FAIL US.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.734
FAIL YOU?

19:09.734 --> 19:13.233
YOU COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD
THE PURPOSE OF THIS ASSIGNMENT.

19:13.233 --> 19:14.600
A-PLUS.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.800
London: SHE HAD TO PAIR ME
WITH YOU. DARN NUN.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.600
THERE. I SAID IT.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.767
I CURSED A NUN,
AND I DON'T CARE.

19:28.767 --> 19:31.967
DARN NUN.
DARN NUN. DARN NUN.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.500
KIDS.

19:34.500 --> 19:37.300
THEY SAY
THE DARNDEST THINGS.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.967
THERE YOU ARE.
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

19:47.967 --> 19:50.033
WHAT TOOK ME SO LONG
IS THAT YOU CALLED ME

19:50.033 --> 19:53.100
AND ASKED ME TO PICK UP
ALL THIS STUFF
ON MY WAY HERE.

19:53.100 --> 19:56.000
I HAD TO GO TO
3 STORES JUST TO FIND
YOUR CAT'S FAVORITE--

19:56.000 --> 19:57.200
CAVIAR AND BITS.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.200
THE NEW FORMULA?

19:58.200 --> 19:59.867
NEW FORMULA?

19:59.867 --> 20:03.200
NEVER MIND. WE'RE LATE
FOR THE CONCERT.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.867
LET'S GET GOING.

20:04.867 --> 20:08.800
YEAH. YOU KNOW, THE PEAS
DON'T GO ON UNTIL 9:00.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.367
SO I WAS THINKING
ON THE WAY THERE,

20:10.367 --> 20:13.100
MAYBE COULD WE
STOP BY MY SCHOOL
AND HEAR CODY'S SPEECH?

20:13.100 --> 20:16.834
YEAH. THEN WE COULD GO
TO THE PARK AND WATCH GRASS DIE.

20:16.834 --> 20:19.233
LOOK, I KNOW
IT'S NOT EXCITING,

20:19.233 --> 20:21.600
BUT HE IS MY BROTHER,
AND IT MEANS A LOT TO HIM.

20:21.600 --> 20:25.233
WHO CARES ABOUT CODY?
YOU'RE HANGING OUT WITH ME NOW.

20:25.233 --> 20:27.900
HERE. PUT THIS
UNDER YOUR SHIRT.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.500
I WANNA TAPE THE CONCERT.

20:29.500 --> 20:30.600
ISN'T THAT ILLEGAL?

20:30.600 --> 20:33.000
THAT'S WHY
IT'S UNDER <i>YOUR </i>SHIRT.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.033
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SURE
I WANNA GO ANYWHERE
WITH YOU.

20:37.033 --> 20:40.233
FINE. WHY DON'T
YOU GO HANG OUT
WITH YOUR LAME BROTHER?

20:40.233 --> 20:42.500
MY BROTHER MAY BE LAME

20:42.500 --> 20:45.233
AND A GEEK AND A WEENIE

20:45.233 --> 20:47.600
AND HE FLOSSES
BETWEEN EVERY BITE

20:47.600 --> 20:50.500
AND--WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT AGAIN?

20:50.500 --> 20:52.100
OH, YEAH.

20:52.100 --> 20:54.600
THEO, YOU CAN'T
INSULT MY BROTHER

20:54.600 --> 20:56.934
AND YOU CAN'T BUY
MY FRIENDSHIP.

20:56.934 --> 20:58.233
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

20:58.233 --> 21:00.066
I'M SAYING WE'RE THROUGH.

21:00.066 --> 21:02.300
EXCUSE ME.

21:02.300 --> 21:05.100
I ONLY GIVE
JAM FORCE MAXES TO MY FRIENDS.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.000
TAKE 'EM.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.500
AND THE SWEAT SUIT.

21:11.834 --> 21:13.667
OK, FINE.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.467
AND THE PANTS.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.600
AHEM.

21:23.600 --> 21:28.300
I BELIEVE
THE BLING BLING IS MINE MINE.

21:31.767 --> 21:34.800
AT LEAST NOW I CAN
LEAVE WITH MY DIGNITY.

21:42.567 --> 21:44.100
I'M NERVOUS, MOM.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.600
WHAT IF I GET IN FRONT
OF THE AUDIENCE AND FREEZE UP?

21:46.600 --> 21:48.700
WELL, THERE'S AN OLD TRICK
THAT ALWAYS WORKED FOR ME.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.300
JUST PICTURE THE AUDIENCE
IN THEIR UNDERWEAR.

21:53.934 --> 21:56.100
HEY, IT WORKS.

21:57.133 --> 21:59.800
HONEY, WHERE ARE THE REST
OF YOUR CLOTHES?

21:59.800 --> 22:01.300
I GAVE THEM BACK
TO THEO.

22:01.300 --> 22:02.967
THE PRICE WAS TOO HIGH.

22:02.967 --> 22:05.300
SO YOU'RE COMING
TO MY SPEECH?

22:05.300 --> 22:06.600
ABSOLUTELY.

22:06.600 --> 22:07.967
SO MY GUILT THING WORKED?

22:07.967 --> 22:09.700
YES, MOM.

22:09.700 --> 22:12.467
I'VE LEARNED
2 THINGS TODAY

22:12.467 --> 22:15.834
IS THAT 1--
YOU CAN'T BUY FRIENDSHIP,

22:15.834 --> 22:18.500
AND 2--CITY BUS DRIVERS
TAKE PITY ON YOU

22:18.500 --> 22:19.500
WHEN YOU'RE HALF NAKED.
