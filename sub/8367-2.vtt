WEBVTT

00:01.560 --> 00:02.320
Jake Green!

00:02.320 --> 00:03.840
How you doing, man?

00:03.840 --> 00:04.220
Wait a minute.

00:04.220 --> 00:06.170
--Where the hell you been?
--Around.

00:06.550 --> 00:08.730
Jake, no one's been around for five years.

00:08.730 --> 00:11.380
Seriously, where have you been?

00:12.160 --> 00:13.300
Hey, brother.

00:13.300 --> 00:14.670
What you put this family through...

00:14.676 --> 00:16.370
--Johnston, for God's sake.
--Now, he could have been...

00:16.372 --> 00:18.823
We could spend a week talking
about what I could have been, all right?

00:18.824 --> 00:21.996
--I've apologized, but I need my
money to make a clean start.
--It's not your money.

00:21.998 --> 00:23.306
It's your grandfather's money.

00:23.437 --> 00:26.880
--Stay one more day.
--I've got to get back to San Diego by tomorrow.

00:34.786 --> 00:37.642
All right, it looks like the explosion came
from the west, maybe Denver.

00:37.857 --> 00:39.022
Did something happen?

00:39.057 --> 00:39.952
Are we under attack?

00:40.228 --> 00:42.830
Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call
sooner, angel, but we...

00:42.835 --> 00:44.761
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:46.718 --> 00:48.972
Sheriff? Robert Hawkins.

00:48.975 --> 00:50.132
I am so sorry.

00:50.336 --> 00:53.292
--I didn't know your mother was in Denver.
--She wasn't in Denver.

00:53.297 --> 00:54.571
She was in Atlanta.

00:54.576 --> 00:55.402
Oh, my God!

00:55.646 --> 00:57.552
Look, I know you're telling people
it was an accident

00:57.566 --> 00:59.450
but if it was an attack, Sheriff

00:59.588 --> 01:01.310
and there's chaos out there,

01:01.508 --> 01:02.950
you might not want the wrong people knowing

01:02.957 --> 01:04.363
that Jericho is still here.

01:04.367 --> 01:05.450
It's the wrong bus!

01:06.796 --> 01:07.530
Riley!

01:09.268 --> 01:11.041
Get April.
We'll meet you at the medical center.

01:11.047 --> 01:12.612
There's an empty prison bus out there.

01:12.857 --> 01:15.271
--What's your name?
--Heather.

01:16.408 --> 01:17.420
Nice to meet you, Jake.

01:17.428 --> 01:20.702
--It's a great thing you did t there tonight.
--Thanks.

01:20.708 --> 01:23.273
Something happened in Denver, Atlanta,

01:23.408 --> 01:25.083
and it could be that we wake up

01:25.086 --> 01:26.873
and we find out that's where it stopped.

01:27.226 --> 01:28.191
But, until we know,

01:28.545 --> 01:31.441
are we going to use our imaginations
to solve problems

01:31.446 --> 01:32.451
or to cause them?

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074

02:18.488 --> 02:21.372
--Is there any sign of the sheriff, Mr. Hawkins?
--No, sir.

02:22.345 --> 02:23.981
I need to speak to your mayor.

02:25.376 --> 02:26.812
We got trouble coming.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.570
Oh, my God.

02:49.325 --> 02:50.532
Mom, where's April?

02:50.696 --> 02:52.612
--Jake, where have you been?
--Where is she?

02:52.848 --> 02:53.831
She's down the hall.

02:54.117 --> 02:56.800
--What's going on?
--Get Dad on the radio.

02:59.275 --> 03:00.800
You'll be fairly mobile on it.

03:00.945 --> 03:02.122
How do you feel?

03:03.118 --> 03:04.671
I feel like a badass.

03:05.107 --> 03:09.192
--April, does the clinic have a fallout shelter?
--Yes. What's going on?

03:09.196 --> 03:10.480
It's bad. Come on.

03:12.428 --> 03:14.650
Jericho has two underground shelters,

03:14.657 --> 03:16.453
one right here under the Town Hall

03:16.456 --> 03:17.663
the other under the medical clinic

03:17.667 --> 03:19.521
What about basements and storm cellars?

03:19.525 --> 03:20.763
They're better than nothing

03:20.826 --> 03:22.323
but you've got to seal off
the rest of the house

03:22.327 --> 03:25.370
with, uh... duct tape, plastic sheeting,

03:25.705 --> 03:27.291
anything you can get your hands on.

03:28.228 --> 03:30.382
How do you know about radiation, Mr. Hawkins?

03:31.056 --> 03:32.632
Because I was a cop in Saint Louis

03:32.636 --> 03:35.082
and, after 9-11, we got up to speed.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.420
So our biggest problem could be the rain.

03:39.417 --> 03:41.781
Won't the rain clear the radiation out of the air?

03:42.217 --> 03:44.513
Yes, and bring it straight down on Jericho--

03:44.887 --> 03:46.523
a direct, concentrated hit.

03:46.525 --> 03:48.312
Anyone exposed too long...

03:52.395 --> 03:53.982
Mr. Mayor? Sir?

03:55.778 --> 03:56.162
All right, look.

03:56.166 --> 03:58.372
We're gonna divide the town in two.

03:59.065 --> 04:01.550
Everyone over here can go
to the Town Hall shelter

04:02.008 --> 04:03.751
all those on the north side will
go to the clinic

04:03.757 --> 04:04.871
We'll get the word out, Dad.

04:04.876 --> 04:08.550
--How long before the radiation gets here?
--Oh, I'm new here.

04:08.806 --> 04:09.552
This is your town.

04:09.558 --> 04:11.883
How long does it normally take
a storm to get here from Denver?

04:11.887 --> 04:14.053
--Less than two hours.
--Sounds right.

04:14.058 --> 04:14.941
Two hours?

04:14.946 --> 04:17.392
--We can't do that in two hours.
--Not enough time.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.072
We've got work to do, guys.

04:39.607 --> 04:42.020
Jake  and I used to play down
here when we were kids.

04:42.027 --> 04:44.501
I don't think anyone's
been down here in ten years.

04:50.015 --> 04:53.443
--How many people can we fit in here?
--300.

04:53.907 --> 04:57.001
You do know that there's almost
5,000 people in this town.

04:57.008 --> 04:58.370
--Eric?
--Yeah?

04:58.798 --> 05:00.570
Make sure all the people
that have basements use them.

05:00.577 --> 05:03.720
--We are not running out of room
here today. You understand?
--Got it, Dad.
Jimmy!

05:15.408 --> 05:18.521
When was the last time someone was in here?

05:23.337 --> 05:24.581
You're kidding me.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.522
I can't put people in here.

05:29.745 --> 05:30.793
There's no air.

05:30.817 --> 05:31.873
There's no air in here.

05:32.578 --> 05:34.013
I hope the fan works.

05:35.227 --> 05:36.660
We got a lot of work to do.

05:50.228 --> 05:51.952
Wait, wait! Hey, hey!

06:08.858 --> 06:11.690
Oh, thank God. I haven't seen anybody for hours.

06:11.696 --> 06:12.770
I ran out of gas.

06:13.327 --> 06:15.643
--There's dead birds all over the road.
--Yeah, we saw them, too.

06:15.645 --> 06:17.143
They must have flown through the radiation.

06:18.997 --> 06:19.922
What radiation?

06:20.798 --> 06:21.860
There was a mushroom cloud.

06:21.956 --> 06:23.153
Somebody nuked us.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.353
Oh, my God.

06:29.167 --> 06:31.013
Look, Miss, we're running low on gas.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.600
Do you know if there's
a gas station nearby?

06:32.607 --> 06:33.780
Well, what do you think it is?

06:33.875 --> 06:36.480
--Do you think it's an accident or...?
--Ma'am, we don't know yet.

06:37.486 --> 06:38.231
Okay.

06:38.395 --> 06:39.371
Did it come from Wichita,

06:39.377 --> 06:41.551
--because my fiance, he's flying in from...
--No, no. Wrong direction.

06:41.555 --> 06:42.751
It looked more like Denver.

06:45.645 --> 06:47.043
Look, we need gas.

06:47.207 --> 06:51.761
--Do you know if there is a gas station nearby?
--Uh... yeah. No.

06:51.987 --> 06:52.942
No, the pumps are...

06:52.947 --> 06:53.790
They don't work.

06:53.796 --> 06:55.120
They've all been abandoned.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.722
No, we could... We could try
the Richmond Ranch.

06:58.726 --> 07:00.692
--I think they might have gas there.
--Then get in.

07:00.698 --> 07:01.422
We'll take you there.

07:05.435 --> 07:06.331
Miss?

07:07.127 --> 07:09.693
It's  okay. Get in.

07:35.815 --> 07:36.553
Dale?

07:37.145 --> 07:38.032
Wake up.

07:40.417 --> 07:41.680
Wake up, angel.

07:44.916 --> 07:45.770
Mom?

07:52.605 --> 07:55.290
Don't you remember what happened last night?

07:56.407 --> 07:57.570
Your mom's gone.

08:03.846 --> 08:07.791
Gracie? Come on, Gracie!
Open up!

08:07.997 --> 08:10.802
Gracie, we need to stock the shelters with food!

08:13.766 --> 08:15.510
Attention! Attention!

08:16.337 --> 08:20.002
There is radioactive fallout
coming from the nuclear blast.

08:20.697 --> 08:23.000
You have less than 90 minutes to get indoors

08:23.008 --> 08:27.230
I repeat, you have less than 90 minutes to get indoors.

08:27.826 --> 08:29.260
Use your basements.

08:29.498 --> 08:32.532
Use duct tape or other tape to seal your home.

08:32.876 --> 08:34.789
You have less than 90 minutes.

08:35.376 --> 08:37.523
You can go to the shelter at Town Hall

08:37.527 --> 08:39.541
or the shelter at the medical center.

08:39.544 --> 08:42.102
There is radioactive fallout coming.

08:42.102 --> 08:44.895
You have 90 minutes to get yourselves indoors.

08:44.894 --> 08:46.406
We are indoors!

08:49.288 --> 08:51.236
You're not from around here, are you?

08:52.418 --> 08:55.992
I came from D.C. to supervise
a little audit on a farm.

08:57.385 --> 08:58.711
Is God punishing me?

08:59.416 --> 09:01.713
Look, you really should get
to the basement at Town Hall.

09:02.297 --> 09:03.380
You think?

09:03.807 --> 09:06.072
--Jake, I'm not going anywhere.
--Mom...

09:06.077 --> 09:08.430
Mom, I'm not going to argue with you.

09:08.667 --> 09:11.001
--Go to the other shelter.
--I'm staying.

09:11.007 --> 09:13.182
Mom,  I don't even know if we can fix it

09:13.187 --> 09:15.110
and I can't concentrate knowing you're here.

09:15.467 --> 09:16.671
Please, I'll be fine.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.173
I'll be fine.

09:20.196 --> 09:22.060
Promise me you'll come to the shelter

09:22.068 --> 09:23.413
after it's fixed.

09:24.745 --> 09:26.082
Promise me.

09:26.797 --> 09:27.883
I promise, Mom.

09:32.167 --> 09:33.922
I want my boys with me.

09:35.577 --> 09:36.580
Okay, go.

09:37.488 --> 09:38.302
Please.

09:43.765 --> 09:45.643
Frank! Quit messing with the TV.

09:45.645 --> 09:47.852
I don't want to waste my generator on static.

09:48.197 --> 09:52.953
--Mary, what are these people still doing here?
--They won't go.

09:53.295 --> 09:55.233
I can't leave these clowns in my bar.

09:56.298 --> 09:57.432
All right, listen up.

09:58.608 --> 10:00.822
Radiation's on its way from Denver.

10:01.057 --> 10:01.911
If you don't have a basement,

10:02.037 --> 10:03.351
you need to get to Town Hall.

10:03.868 --> 10:04.871
There's a shelter there.

10:04.875 --> 10:06.503
I'm not going to Town Hall.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.953
Well, you don't have a choice, people.

10:11.157 --> 10:12.481
You're being evacuated.

10:12.815 --> 10:14.023
And who are you?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.560
I'm the deputy mayor.

10:20.077 --> 10:22.371
What, did your daddy make you a deputy?

10:24.387 --> 10:25.202
Just forget it, Eric,

10:25.208 --> 10:26.440
you've told everybody.

10:30.386 --> 10:34.000
--Do you realize a nuclear bomb went off yesterday?
--So?

10:34.468 --> 10:36.843
If I'm going to die in a nuclear blast, so be it.

10:37.305 --> 10:38.461
I'm going to be right here

10:38.976 --> 10:40.681
playing pool with my buddies.

10:41.698 --> 10:43.293
But you're not going to die in a blast.

10:45.315 --> 10:47.423
You're going to get radiation poisoning.

10:49.887 --> 10:51.523
Within the first couple of hours

10:52.536 --> 10:53.582
you're going to be vomiting

10:53.786 --> 10:55.530
and have crippling diarrhea.

10:56.625 --> 10:58.502
Your hair is going to fall out in chunks.

10:58.998 --> 10:59.890
Your skin,

11:00.325 --> 11:01.490
it's going to blister.

11:02.638 --> 11:05.240
Your internal organs are going to start to shut down.

11:06.218 --> 11:08.040
Because, well, frankly...

11:09.405 --> 11:11.732
...they're being cooked from the inside.

11:12.316 --> 11:14.063
You're going to get sicker and sicker

11:14.316 --> 11:15.453
until you can't move.

11:17.296 --> 11:18.442
And then you will die.

11:21.096 --> 11:23.310
Over there on the floor by the pool table...

11:23.885 --> 11:24.820
with your buddies.

11:45.995 --> 11:47.121
Ooh.

11:47.655 --> 11:48.661
Don't mind me.

12:15.055 --> 12:15.953
Sit tight.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.433
We'll be right back.

12:36.848 --> 12:37.493
Sheriff, come in.

12:37.497 --> 12:39.023
Come in, Sheriff, over.

12:39.315 --> 12:41.791
Randall, no one's heard from the sheriff
since last night

12:41.797 --> 12:43.482
There was a prison bus out there.

12:43.488 --> 12:45.490
I think we better assume the worst.

12:45.496 --> 12:46.322
You're on your own.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.091
What about Jimmy or Bill?

12:48.877 --> 12:49.881
Deputies are missing, too.

12:49.886 --> 12:51.663
You're  just going to have
to handle this yourself.

12:55.908 --> 12:57.693
Don't think we forgot you, did you?

13:03.845 --> 13:06.611
--Anything wrong, Miss?
--No, nothing.

13:07.615 --> 13:08.793
Doesn't look like anybody's here.

13:08.795 --> 13:11.081
Yeah, well, the pump's locked, so...

13:11.666 --> 13:13.832
You know, there is this other place
that I can take you to.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.942
Look, we're running on fumes as it is.

13:26.966 --> 13:29.392
Make a sound, you die.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.103
I'm sorry, sir,

13:32.105 --> 13:33.773
I don't think anybody's home.

13:39.567 --> 13:40.421
Ms. Sullivan...

13:40.425 --> 13:42.591
--What a surprise.
--Hey, Bonnie.

13:53.806 --> 13:55.410
Oxygen tanks, IVs,

13:55.486 --> 13:58.140
all non-electrical medical supplies.

13:58.567 --> 14:00.820
--When was that written?
--1957.

14:00.827 --> 14:02.882
The population of Jericho was 1,000 people.

14:03.246 --> 14:04.421
I'll start moving everyone.

14:04.428 --> 14:06.510
I'll get the ventilation system fixed.

14:09.618 --> 14:11.522
God, they chewed through everything.

14:11.705 --> 14:12.670
Mind if I pitch in?

14:13.146 --> 14:14.820
You know how to strip wires?

14:15.216 --> 14:16.573
Ever since junior high.

14:18.378 --> 14:19.773
Yeah, I was that popular.

14:20.408 --> 14:21.462
All right, great.

14:22.005 --> 14:22.700
Check the fan belt,

14:22.705 --> 14:23.741
I think it's frayed.

14:23.907 --> 14:25.543
Well, then you might want to get another one.

14:26.448 --> 14:29.440
Any mid-century American car would
be a good match.

14:29.448 --> 14:30.702
And check the brushers.

14:30.708 --> 14:32.250
--We don't want the motor to seize up.
--Okay.

14:32.256 --> 14:33.160
All right.

14:33.947 --> 14:35.192
You take over.

14:35.506 --> 14:36.780
I'll  look for a fan belt.

14:41.266 --> 14:43.031
Excuse me, sir.

14:43.188 --> 14:44.352
You're doing that wrong.

14:47.368 --> 14:48.060
April.

14:48.748 --> 14:50.650
She thinks we shouldn't move the baby.

14:52.055 --> 14:55.750
Ma'am, your baby's protected
in this little bubble.

14:56.388 --> 14:58.451
She's got fresh air and food.

14:58.957 --> 15:01.001
Right now, she's the safest
person in Jericho

15:01.006 --> 15:01.922
but you're not.

15:02.707 --> 15:05.060
We need to make sure she has
a mother to take care of her

15:05.065 --> 15:08.260
when this thing is over, okay?

15:08.656 --> 15:09.551
Please.

15:10.525 --> 15:15.722
--Please, let us take you both
down to the shelter, okay?
--Mm-hmm.

15:15.728 --> 15:16.653
Okay.

15:20.945 --> 15:22.470
--Bobby.
--Jake Green?

15:22.477 --> 15:23.190
Just a second, ma'am.

15:23.198 --> 15:25.322
--obby, there's two in the nursery.
--I'm Emily Sullivan's aunt.

15:26.346 --> 15:29.191
...taken to the shelter in our basement.

15:29.195 --> 15:31.363
Mrs. Dawson, hi.

15:31.877 --> 15:34.600
--Have you seen Emily?
--No, not since yesterday.

15:34.606 --> 15:36.142
Maybe she's at the other shelter.

15:36.148 --> 15:37.542
No one over there has seen her

15:37.545 --> 15:39.361
and she's not at her house.

15:41.306 --> 15:42.520
I heard you were back in town

15:42.526 --> 15:44.912
--and I figured the one person who would know...
--I'm sorry.

15:45.688 --> 15:46.241
I have to go.

15:46.447 --> 15:47.980
If I see her, I'll tell her
you're looking for her

15:47.987 --> 15:49.102
but I'm sure she's fine.

15:58.297 --> 15:59.733
So we'll just, uh,

15:59.935 --> 16:01.912
use your pump and be on our way.

16:02.298 --> 16:03.580
Stanley has the key.

16:04.275 --> 16:05.333
What did she just say?

16:05.958 --> 16:07.682
Oh... her brother, Stanley,

16:07.688 --> 16:09.070
he's got the key to the pump.

16:09.508 --> 16:10.133
Wait a minute,

16:10.486 --> 16:12.971
--she's deaf?
--Yes.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.780
I read lips.

16:20.428 --> 16:22.873
--When do you think Stanley gets back?
--Another hour.

16:23.165 --> 16:24.763
--Whoa, whoa, whoa.
--What did she just say?

16:25.158 --> 16:26.393
It's going to be about an hour.

16:26.907 --> 16:30.640
Oh, we can wait an hour, can't we?

16:33.798 --> 16:36.351
Ms. Sullivan, you all right?

16:39.816 --> 16:40.860
Yeah, fine.

16:41.215 --> 16:42.300
I'm just hungry.

16:43.408 --> 16:44.260
Yeah, uh...

16:44.267 --> 16:47.723
Why don't we make some food for the officers?

16:48.548 --> 16:50.180
Oh, I want eggs.

16:50.615 --> 16:51.153
It's a farmhouse,

16:51.155 --> 16:52.361
you've got eggs, right?

16:54.516 --> 16:55.993
Yeah, why don't we, uh...

16:56.826 --> 16:58.222
Why don't we all go make something to eat?

16:59.318 --> 17:00.280
Sure.

17:08.327 --> 17:10.612
People south of Main
go to you at Town Hall?

17:10.616 --> 17:11.510
Yeah, that's right,

17:11.515 --> 17:14.319
all those to the north of Main Street
go to the medical center.

17:14.327 --> 17:17.332
--Johnston.
--Right, yeah, I know, you want me
to take it easy.

17:17.336 --> 17:21.420
--I'm just going to go help Eric
get the supplies from Gracie.
--I've already sent people to do that.

17:21.426 --> 17:23.803
Gail, who is in charge here, you or me?

17:24.415 --> 17:26.132
You do not want to play that game.

17:26.247 --> 17:29.670
Here's every book we have in the library
about nuclear radiation.

17:30.058 --> 17:32.551
--Our Friend The Atom.
--Some friend.

17:33.408 --> 17:34.923
Anything in here for grownups?

17:34.927 --> 17:36.232
I'd like to know what we're supposed to do

17:36.235 --> 17:37.320
if this town gets hit.

17:37.876 --> 17:39.392
None of the books are specific.

17:40.128 --> 17:43.321
Atom bombs have only gone off in
populated cities twice in history.

17:43.665 --> 17:46.002
And Denver was probably hit
by a hydrogen bomb, anyway.

17:46.348 --> 17:47.432
What's the difference?

17:47.486 --> 17:51.152
Hydrogen bombs, they literally
explode the air.

17:51.777 --> 17:55.501
So, what you're saying
is that nobody knows

17:55.505 --> 17:56.852
what's really coming?

17:58.827 --> 18:00.383
Then we pick worst case scenario.

18:00.387 --> 18:03.180
--What needs to be done?
--One second, sir, I have that.

18:03.257 --> 18:04.393
Let me just...

18:05.328 --> 18:08.792
Anything left outside
will have to be scrubbed down.

18:09.136 --> 18:12.750
And if it rains, the top
18 inches or so of soil

18:12.756 --> 18:15.213
will have to be removed before planting again.

18:15.218 --> 18:18.253
And tell everybody to cover
all the water wells.

18:19.255 --> 18:20.940
That's about what it says, right?

18:23.158 --> 18:25.101
Yes. Yes, that's right.

18:26.477 --> 18:27.993
Well, you heard the man.

18:27.998 --> 18:31.143
Jeff, let's make sure all the ranchers
get the livestock inside.

18:31.556 --> 18:33.431
I'm going to work on the radio.

18:33.927 --> 18:37.043
This may be our last chance
to make contact for a while.

18:37.546 --> 18:38.640
There's a bunch of people in the church.

18:38.648 --> 18:39.893
They held a vigil there all night.

18:39.898 --> 18:41.821
I'm going to make sure they get into shelter.

18:41.895 --> 18:45.012
--Hurry back.
--Yes, ma'am.

18:48.366 --> 18:51.010
--I'm telling you they need to be replaced.
--Listen, girlie...

18:51.016 --> 18:53.083
Please, don't argue with me.
don't tell me...

18:53.088 --> 18:54.540
The brushers are shot,

18:54.546 --> 18:56.091
it's revving too high. It's...

18:58.137 --> 18:58.953
Turn them off!

19:06.858 --> 19:08.330
Jake, everyone's ready.

19:08.556 --> 19:10.363
--What do we do now?
--Don't let them in here!

19:10.795 --> 19:12.421
The rain's going to be here soon.

19:12.427 --> 19:13.820
People are getting scared.

19:14.147 --> 19:15.623
Do we have air or not?

19:15.977 --> 19:17.753
You seal them up in here
they're going to die.

19:27.665 --> 19:28.673
Hello,Dad

19:29.387 --> 19:30.583
Dad, can you hear me?

19:31.527 --> 19:32.903
Dad's checking on the church, Jake

19:32.985 --> 19:33.743
What do you need?

19:34.135 --> 19:35.571
Our shelter's no good.

19:35.615 --> 19:37.250
I'm bringing these people to Town Hall.

19:37.255 --> 19:38.141
Whoa, whoa, hold on.

19:38.297 --> 19:40.613
Jake, I don't know how many more
people we can hold.

19:41.076 --> 19:43.613
--What about the basement?
--They don't have basements, Eric.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.700
That's why they came here.

19:45.328 --> 19:47.543
Eric, we've got 200 people here.

19:47.548 --> 19:49.732
Some of them need medical attention.

19:49.916 --> 19:50.962
Handle it.

19:51.368 --> 19:52.710
Look, I will be at Town Hall soon.

19:52.715 --> 19:54.492
I'll check to see how much room we have.

19:54.496 --> 19:57.580
--And I will call you back.
--I don't have time. We're coming.

19:57.956 --> 20:02.073
--Sorry, my husband needs a kick sometimes.
--You don't have to apologize to me.

20:06.897 --> 20:08.053
I've got to go to the shelter.

20:08.056 --> 20:09.373
Bring everything you can.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.192
H-How much more do you need?

20:13.736 --> 20:17.112
--Enough to feed half the town, Gracie.
--Half the town?

20:17.465 --> 20:18.240
Wait--

20:25.478 --> 20:29.031
--Skylar, you have to come to the shelter.
--I'm not going to some stupid shelter.

20:29.038 --> 20:30.600
I'm going home to wait for my parents.

20:30.785 --> 20:32.292
--Don't be crazy.
--I'm not crazy!

20:32.298 --> 20:33.902
--I'm going home.
--Fine.

20:33.907 --> 20:35.550
Excuse me, ladie

20:35.827 --> 20:37.420
Are you going to pay for those?

20:38.185 --> 20:38.973
What are you talking about?

20:38.975 --> 20:40.711
Everybody is just taking stuff.

20:40.716 --> 20:42.591
This is still my store.

20:42.906 --> 20:44.620
Is that for an emergency?

20:47.058 --> 20:48.242
All right, you know what?

20:49.058 --> 20:50.503
Fine, keep it.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.593
Her parents are in New York, okay?

20:54.596 --> 20:56.740
Who knows if they're even going to come back.

20:59.578 --> 21:03.431
--It was just a couple cans of soda.
--They're my soda.

21:13.356 --> 21:14.600
I say we head east.

21:14.717 --> 21:16.343
She was headed east, wasn't she?

21:17.395 --> 21:21.071
Hey, how far from here
would you say those crows were?

21:21.538 --> 21:24.030
About five miles west
from where you picked me up.

21:25.977 --> 21:27.302
Hell,  then we'll go north.

21:41.848 --> 21:42.470
Hey.

21:43.066 --> 21:44.950
You want to help me out with the coffee?

21:45.826 --> 21:47.542
Yeah, I'll show you where it is.

21:59.057 --> 22:00.260
You better get down to that shelter.

22:00.265 --> 22:02.870
--The wind is moving faster than we thought
--I'm watching it.

22:02.876 --> 22:04.700
Just get everybody underground.

22:06.267 --> 22:07.633
You know, if you get that thing to work,

22:07.638 --> 22:11.240
just do me a favor, and find
out who did this to us.

22:32.538 --> 22:34.921
--Eric, come in.
--This is Eric, go ahead.

22:34.925 --> 22:37.412
A couple of busloads coming to Town Hall.

22:50.206 --> 22:51.383
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:51.388 --> 22:52.580
People, please!

22:52.585 --> 22:53.600
Don't get off the bus.

22:53.605 --> 22:56.610
--We can't take any more.
--Eric, what the hell are you doing?

22:56.928 --> 22:57.872
They can't come in here, Jake.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.333
--What do you mean they can't come in here?
--We're packed!

22:59.337 --> 23:01.912
What? I got a whole bus full of
people here that need shelter.

23:01.918 --> 23:04.262
You're really gonna turn away
all these people, Eric?

23:04.265 --> 23:05.821
You're going to turn away your wife?

23:06.278 --> 23:07.630
We let everybody in,

23:07.638 --> 23:08.982
we'll all suffocate.

23:09.126 --> 23:11.002
Eric, there are really sick people here

23:11.008 --> 23:12.530
and the storm is coming!

23:12.538 --> 23:13.692
Okay, we can take ten.

23:14.877 --> 23:16.201
And I saved a spot for you.

23:17.287 --> 23:19.263
All right, the ten most critical, fast.

23:19.265 --> 23:21.890
Gray, the salt mine,
how many people will it hold?

23:21.898 --> 23:22.912
As many as you want,

23:22.916 --> 23:25.292
--but I don't think...
--It has a ventilation system, right?

23:25.557 --> 23:29.511
--Yeah, and water.
--All right, it's the best option
we have right now, all right?

23:29.795 --> 23:30.291
Mom?

23:30.295 --> 23:31.651
Have you seen your father?

23:31.815 --> 23:33.773
He told me he was going to the church.

23:33.838 --> 23:37.160
Well, Gail, people from that church got
back 20 minutes ago.

23:38.038 --> 23:38.772
Eric?

23:39.248 --> 23:40.580
Mom, we'll find Dad.

23:40.587 --> 23:44.492
--Jake, take your people to the mine.
Leave us 10.
--I'll go with you, Jake.

23:45.185 --> 23:48.010
After 27 years, nobody knows
that mine the way I do.

23:48.285 --> 23:50.072
I guess you can fit 11 people now.

23:51.485 --> 23:52.423
Yeah, make it 12.

23:52.975 --> 23:53.950
It's my place--

23:54.195 --> 23:55.173
I should be there.

23:55.937 --> 23:57.260
Yeah, let's go.

23:59.995 --> 24:00.812
Hey.

24:01.876 --> 24:03.162
We're going to be okay.

24:15.666 --> 24:16.452
Hang on.

24:26.877 --> 24:30.111
--That smells good.
--Oh, no, no, I'll get it.

24:36.215 --> 24:37.163
Oh!

24:38.167 --> 24:40.703
--I am so sorry.
--Damn it.

24:40.708 --> 24:42.162
Oh, that looks bad.

24:42.168 --> 24:43.450
Look, go in the kitchen right now

24:43.456 --> 24:44.852
and run cold water over it.

24:44.855 --> 24:46.753
It'll stop it before the blisters.

24:47.176 --> 24:48.483
I'll clean up this mess.

24:55.896 --> 24:57.341
--What happened?
--She...

24:58.927 --> 24:59.943
I burnt my hand.

25:00.446 --> 25:01.370
You left her alone?

25:02.518 --> 25:03.690
She's fine.

25:12.525 --> 25:13.583
Is he okay?

25:14.947 --> 25:16.161
He'll live.

25:26.718 --> 25:29.470
I can only get 12 down
on the elevator at a time!

25:29.475 --> 25:30.871
That's the best I can do!

25:31.197 --> 25:33.310
Shep, we have to seal the entrance.

25:33.317 --> 25:34.320
There's no door, Jake.

25:34.447 --> 25:36.141
Well, we can't just let the rain
pour down the shaft.

25:36.146 --> 25:37.070
These people won't be safe.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.373
--We won't be safe.
--Well, how do we seal it?

25:39.478 --> 25:41.471
I don't know, but it's a mine.

25:41.756 --> 25:44.573
--You got dynamite, right?
--Whoa, whoa...

25:45.226 --> 25:48.830
--We put charges here, here, here...
--Are you crazy?

25:48.835 --> 25:51.613
How do we know we won't bring
the whole thing down on top of us?

25:52.668 --> 25:53.911
We don't.

26:53.287 --> 26:55.780
I am going to the little girls' room.

26:55.787 --> 26:59.211
--Hey, where is that?
--Right up the stairs.

26:59.218 --> 27:01.740
--Right there, see?
--Good to know.

27:12.768 --> 27:13.720
Straight back!

27:14.936 --> 27:18.132
--Eric, any sign of Dad?
--No, not yet.

27:18.325 --> 27:19.681
Checked the church, Main Street.

27:19.688 --> 27:21.621
We're going through every inch
of Town Hall right now.

27:22.237 --> 27:23.253
Listen, Eric,

27:23.497 --> 27:25.283
I'm going to need you
to bring a crew over here

27:25.288 --> 27:27.100
and dig us out when this thing's over.

27:27.108 --> 27:28.691
What? What? Why?

27:28.896 --> 27:30.831
--We're ready, Jake!
--Are you crazy?

27:30.836 --> 27:33.793
Just dig us out-- and find Dad, okay?

27:34.147 --> 27:35.070
Let's go.

28:10.425 --> 28:12.262
Mr. Hawkins, did my father come through here?

28:12.648 --> 28:13.932
No, I haven't seen him.

28:15.115 --> 28:18.233
--Mom, check the offices again.
--Maybe we missed something.

28:18.237 --> 28:19.473
I'll go check out the parking lot.

28:19.937 --> 28:24.241
--Look, we'll find him, okay?
--Okay. Be careful. Be careful.

28:28.856 --> 28:29.911
Could you use some help, ma'am?

28:30.216 --> 28:31.770
No, we need you on the radio.

28:32.016 --> 28:35.162
You know, I can't get this old thing to work.

28:36.175 --> 28:37.220
--Okay, come.
--Fine.

28:37.436 --> 28:38.330
Please.

29:12.716 --> 29:14.210
You are not in my house.

29:14.406 --> 29:16.392
Get off my property, right now.

29:16.396 --> 29:18.912
And my property goes all the way down the hill.

29:19.777 --> 29:20.812
You need to get back to town.

29:20.956 --> 29:22.633
The radiation's coming from Denver.

29:24.148 --> 29:25.040
I'm not leaving here.

29:25.048 --> 29:26.743
My parents are on their way back.

29:28.065 --> 29:30.751
--You talked to them?
--No, freak, the phones are dead.

29:30.758 --> 29:32.732
But I'm not leaving here without them.

29:34.086 --> 29:35.982
All right, stay inside,

29:35.987 --> 29:36.953
tape up the windows,

29:37.047 --> 29:38.251
and don't use the water.

29:39.357 --> 29:41.613
--Don't tell me what to do.
--I'm serious, Skylar.

29:41.615 --> 29:42.580
Stay inside.

29:50.907 --> 29:51.723
Dale?

29:51.975 --> 29:53.021
Dale, stop!

29:54.008 --> 29:54.931
Please.

29:59.416 --> 30:00.470
Stay here.

30:02.238 --> 30:03.542
It's not safe out there.

30:06.938 --> 30:08.370
Please stay here.

30:31.066 --> 30:32.321
Jody, where you at?

30:32.325 --> 30:33.131
All right, everybody...

30:33.137 --> 30:34.263
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:35.605 --> 30:37.041
Take some of that out, all right?

30:37.737 --> 30:39.721
Seal the entrance, not cause a cave-in.

30:41.148 --> 30:41.893
Hey.

30:42.348 --> 30:43.750
Where'd you learn how to do that?

30:44.548 --> 30:45.602
I knew a guy once.

30:46.427 --> 30:47.992
Did you blow him up?

31:01.288 --> 31:03.081
Hello? Is anyone here?

31:04.057 --> 31:06.171
--How does that look?
--It's good, that'll do.

31:07.296 --> 31:09.770
--How we coming, Gray?
--This is the last of 'em.

31:10.116 --> 31:12.222
--I'm almost done here.
--Same here.

31:12.658 --> 31:14.000
This is Emily Sullivan.

31:14.007 --> 31:16.021
We're at the Richmond Ranch with Bonnie.

31:17.118 --> 31:18.291
Please, help us.

31:20.665 --> 31:22.733
Can you hear me?
Is there anybody there?

31:22.818 --> 31:23.660
What was that?

31:24.167 --> 31:24.972
Did you hear that?

31:25.465 --> 31:26.970
--Somebody's on the radio.
--This is Emily Sullivan.

31:26.977 --> 31:29.221
--I'm at the Richmond Ranch.
--Everybody be quiet!

31:29.225 --> 31:30.283
There are men here with guns.

31:30.285 --> 31:33.191
I think they might have
killed the sheriff. Hello?

31:34.565 --> 31:35.423
Can you hear me?

31:38.408 --> 31:40.280
Emily! Emily!

31:42.428 --> 31:43.630
Emily, can you hear me?

31:44.258 --> 31:45.162
Emily.

31:45.198 --> 31:46.402
Come in, come in.

31:46.677 --> 31:47.763
Come in, can you hear me?

31:49.145 --> 31:50.501
Is there anyone out there?

31:56.536 --> 31:57.703
Is there anyone on this channel?

31:57.937 --> 31:58.940
Can anyone here me?

32:00.335 --> 32:01.681
Shep, give me your keys.

32:01.925 --> 32:05.251
--Jake, it's gonna start raining any minute now.
--Give me your keys, I can make it.

32:05.438 --> 32:07.423
--All right.
--Jake, you're out of your mind.

32:08.115 --> 32:10.600
Gray, get everybody down there, all right?

32:15.256 --> 32:16.531
--Hey, Jake?
--What?

32:22.717 --> 32:23.683
When everybody's down,

32:23.688 --> 32:24.761
say "all clear."

32:24.858 --> 32:26.731
"All clear," okay?

32:42.438 --> 32:44.523
Almost ready, Jake, stand by.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.300
Come on, come on.

32:53.108 --> 32:53.691
Jake?

32:54.478 --> 32:55.721
We're all clear.

33:03.075 --> 33:07.182
Johnston? Johnston?

33:15.007 --> 33:16.132
Gail...

33:22.336 --> 33:23.220
Oh, my God.

33:24.516 --> 33:25.641
Mr. Hawkins!

33:26.318 --> 33:27.593
Mr. Hawkins!

33:28.268 --> 33:29.593
Mr. Hawkins!

33:33.618 --> 33:34.750
Where's the brother?

33:41.045 --> 33:42.291
Where the hell's the girl?

33:47.415 --> 33:48.782
I think they might have killed...

33:48.995 --> 33:50.710
I think they might have killed the sheriffs.

34:04.446 --> 34:05.922
Please, help us.

34:21.487 --> 34:23.271
Hello. This is Emily Sullivan.

34:23.405 --> 34:25.679
I'm looking for the Jericho Police Department.

34:28.905 --> 34:29.591
Can you hear me?

34:29.597 --> 34:30.951
Is there anyone out there?

34:34.324 --> 34:35.713
Is there anybody on this channel?

34:36.096 --> 34:37.199
There are men here with guns.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.980
I think they might have killed the sheriff.

34:44.288 --> 34:45.562
Please, somebody help us.

34:54.088 --> 34:55.382
Run, Emily,

34:55.585 --> 34:56.362
run.

34:59.557 --> 35:01.230
Hey! Hey!

35:04.107 --> 35:04.561
Stop!

35:04.727 --> 35:05.501
Stop!

35:08.048 --> 35:09.850
Think this through! Let her go!

35:11.036 --> 35:11.652
No.

35:12.086 --> 35:13.482
We just want gas.

35:14.425 --> 35:16.361
Supplies, that's all this is about.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.202
It's just about fuel.

35:18.518 --> 35:20.072
Let her go.

35:22.976 --> 35:23.832
Look.

35:29.036 --> 35:31.260
Please, please, let her go.

35:33.478 --> 35:34.291
No.

35:34.385 --> 35:35.781
Is this what you want to see?

35:36.475 --> 35:38.221
Are you ready to talk now, Miss?

35:39.505 --> 35:40.842
Please, let her go.

36:11.846 --> 36:12.352
April...

36:12.616 --> 36:13.433
April, come here.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.212
Hey, Dad, can you tell me what happened?

36:18.218 --> 36:19.712
Sit down.
Here, sit him down.

36:19.855 --> 36:21.873
I just found him on the floor in his office.

36:24.286 --> 36:25.110
Did you hit your head?

36:26.666 --> 36:27.482
All right.

36:34.766 --> 36:36.702
Bonnie, take him to the storm cellar now!

36:36.708 --> 36:37.712
Go, guys, go!

36:38.885 --> 36:40.443
Emily, we've got to get inside.

36:42.308 --> 36:43.860
Emily? Emily, hey.

36:44.145 --> 36:45.161
It's going to be okay

36:45.576 --> 36:46.320
All right? I promise.

36:46.327 --> 36:48.440
Everything is going to be okay, all right?

36:48.448 --> 36:50.300
We've got to gin now, babe.

36:51.316 --> 36:51.973
Babe?

36:53.168 --> 36:56.110
We've got to get inside
before the rain, okay?

36:56.158 --> 36:57.171
Come with me.

36:57.888 --> 36:58.621
Come on.

36:59.065 --> 37:00.742
Run. Run.

37:04.308 --> 37:05.121
Get inside!

37:17.956 --> 37:21.143
--Hey, Dad.
--Hey. How you doing?

37:21.957 --> 37:22.891
You comfortable?

37:23.496 --> 37:24.890
Just like camping.

37:25.476 --> 37:26.802
You hate camping.

37:27.288 --> 37:28.210
Yep.

37:32.105 --> 37:33.271
Where's Allison?

37:34.017 --> 37:37.201
--She's up in her room.
--Samuel, go get Ali.

37:37.208 --> 37:38.253
Yes, sir.

37:43.278 --> 37:45.251
--Tell her I'm home.
--Yes, sir.

37:47.397 --> 37:48.842
Robert. Robert.

37:50.675 --> 37:52.983
--What's happening out there?
--I don't know.

37:53.676 --> 37:54.682
You know.

37:55.278 --> 37:57.032
--You always know something.
--Hey, hey...

37:57.926 --> 38:00.301
You are alive, Darcy,

38:00.615 --> 38:01.513
okay?

38:01.866 --> 38:03.141
And the kids are safe.

38:05.056 --> 38:07.011
You know, don't ask me questions.

38:39.038 --> 38:40.902
I think my mom died yesterday.

38:45.868 --> 38:48.550
I think my mom died yesterday, too.

39:13.198 --> 39:14.212
I thought you were gone.

39:17.348 --> 39:19.243
--Emily...
--Why are you here?

39:22.008 --> 39:23.330
Trying to keep you safe.

39:25.795 --> 39:27.430
It's never safe around you.
