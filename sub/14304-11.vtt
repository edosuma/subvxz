Oh. Hello, children.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.658
Uh... hey.

00:59.660 --> 01:03.729
You should be at home
with the door locked.

01:03.731 --> 01:06.765
We're here for your...
to see your haunted house.

01:06.767 --> 01:11.737
But this is
the most dangerous place to be.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.006
( sniffs )

01:14.008 --> 01:17.743
Well, then,
step inside...

01:17.745 --> 01:20.712
at your peril.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.015
Is this a joke?

01:23.017 --> 01:24.583
Just remember our deal.

01:24.585 --> 01:29.855
Perhaps you are
more brave than smart.

01:29.857 --> 01:33.792
Or perhaps you are
just like me.

01:33.794 --> 01:38.230
Perhaps you, too,
have sympathy for the monster.

01:38.232 --> 01:39.565
Oh, boy.

01:39.567 --> 01:40.966
But beware.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.734
( gasps )

01:42.736 --> 01:45.737
Do not do
what I have done.

01:45.739 --> 01:50.309
You must never
let the monster inside.

01:53.646 --> 01:56.415
( mechanical grunting )

01:56.417 --> 01:58.250
I can't do this.

01:58.252 --> 02:01.220
Can you turn on
the lights, please?

02:01.222 --> 02:04.323
Look, man, you seem like
a nice guy,

02:04.325 --> 02:06.959
and I wanna
be scared,

02:06.961 --> 02:09.094
I really do.

02:09.096 --> 02:11.430
But the truth is,
I'm eight.

02:11.432 --> 02:15.667
That's like 90 years old
in Halloween years.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.836
Next year, we might not even
be afraid of monsters.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.605
I don't wanna
waste my time.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.240
I'm sorry.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.242
You're just not scary.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.511
I'm not scary?

02:25.513 --> 02:28.480
Come on, guys.
Let's go to a real
haunted house.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.682
We had a deal, remember?

02:30.684 --> 02:32.651
( grunting )

02:32.653 --> 02:34.486
Okay. Halloween is over.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.688
Janna and Star
need to go home now.

02:36.690 --> 02:40.259
Dad, Star lives here.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.094
( laughs )
Yes, Marco.

02:42.096 --> 02:44.263
It doesn't always
have to be an argument.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.632
Sometimes we just
do what Daddy says.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.467
( straining )

02:48.469 --> 02:50.869
Now if anybody needs me,
I'll be in the shed.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.705
( struggling )

02:56.442 --> 02:58.844
He does this every year,
and it makes him miserable.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.379
Okay, so what do we do?

03:00.381 --> 03:01.847
Oh, I got it.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.448
Let's go to that other house
down the street

03:03.450 --> 03:04.783
and just ditch this one.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.885
What? No.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.554
You're missing
the point.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.489
How do we make my dad's
haunted house scary?

03:10.491 --> 03:11.857
We can always summon
Hungry Larry.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.525
Uh... who?

03:13.527 --> 03:15.327
Oh, Hungry Larry.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.462
You know, you summon him,
he comes and haunts your house.

03:17.464 --> 03:19.331
I hear he's a real creep.

03:19.333 --> 03:23.302
We're not summoning...

03:23.304 --> 03:24.970
anyone.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.705
We're not summoning... ugh!

03:26.707 --> 03:28.740
I can't believe I even have to
have this conversation with you.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.242
Where are you going?

03:30.244 --> 03:31.977
I'm gonna go bribe
some five-year-olds.

03:31.979 --> 03:35.347
Maybe they'll think
my dad's scary.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.849
No summoning.

03:37.851 --> 03:41.720
Okay, it says here,
"If Hungry Larry is
the haunt you need,

03:41.722 --> 03:43.689
do these actions
and you'll succeed.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.324
A lick of mustard
you must bear,

03:45.326 --> 03:47.526
off an old takeout menu
if you dare."

03:47.528 --> 03:49.861
All right.
Done.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.863
"Then three times
his name is said.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.999
Arrive he does
with scares and dread."

03:57.937 --> 04:01.039
BOTH: Hungry Larry.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.441
Hungry Larry.

04:02.443 --> 04:05.844
Hungry Larry.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.413
( knocking )

04:09.916 --> 04:12.517
( knocking )

04:19.359 --> 04:20.525
Uh, Star Butterfly?

04:20.527 --> 04:21.860
You summoned me.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.764
Can I come in or what?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.566
Star, invite him in.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.501
Please, come on in.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.806
Honey, I know you're
probably totally humiliated

04:34.808 --> 04:36.942
that you wrestled
that blow-up doll

04:36.944 --> 04:38.910
in front of your son
and his friends,

04:38.912 --> 04:42.214
but everyone inside
loves you.

04:42.216 --> 04:44.216
( sighs )

04:44.218 --> 04:47.953
There's a bowl of candy corn
for you out here on the porch.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.655
Don't step on it.

04:50.990 --> 04:53.191
Rafael, I can see you
in the window!

04:54.494 --> 04:57.329
So, basically,
we just need the house

04:57.331 --> 04:58.964
to be, like,
super scary.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.833
Mr. Diaz hasn't scared
a single kid all night.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.803
Actually, I don't know
if he's ever scared
a single kid ever.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.104
But Janna and I
are pretty handy,

05:06.106 --> 05:07.472
so how can we help?

05:07.474 --> 05:10.475
- ( practicing scary noises )
- Larry?

05:10.477 --> 05:12.444
( continues practicing )

05:12.446 --> 05:14.913
Larry,
whatcha doing?

05:14.915 --> 05:16.915
Oh, you guys
are still here?

05:16.917 --> 05:18.283
We're not guys.

05:18.285 --> 05:21.486
Cool.
Can you leave?

05:21.488 --> 05:23.522
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Okay, fine.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.090
You're working.
I get it.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.059
You guys
are still here?

05:28.461 --> 05:32.097
That guy isn't scary.
He's creepy.

05:32.099 --> 05:35.667
( sighs ) Bummer.
I really just wanted Mr. D.
to have his haunted house.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.669
Even if you did give him
a haunted house,

05:37.671 --> 05:40.172
that wouldn't make
Mr. Diaz scary.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.307
Yeah, maybe not.

05:42.309 --> 05:44.009
But at least
it'd be something.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.644
Should we just
call it off?

05:45.646 --> 05:46.978
You mean fire
Hungry Larry?

05:46.980 --> 05:48.313
I guess.

05:48.315 --> 05:49.881
Oh, can I fire him?

05:49.883 --> 05:52.050
- Go for it.
- Yes!

05:53.686 --> 05:55.887
Poor Mr. Diaz.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.823
( Janna shrieks )

05:57.825 --> 06:01.393
( shrieking continues )

06:02.895 --> 06:04.963
Star, what was that?

06:04.965 --> 06:07.165
- Uh, I think
it was Janna.
- ( doorbell rings )

06:07.167 --> 06:10.001
( clamoring )

06:10.003 --> 06:14.506
Hey, did that scream come from
inside of this haunted house?

06:14.508 --> 06:16.007
Uh...

06:16.009 --> 06:17.809
Yes. Welcome, kids,

06:17.811 --> 06:21.346
to the Diaz
House of Horror!

06:21.348 --> 06:22.581
( cheering )

06:22.583 --> 06:24.549
Star, seriously.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.084
What is going on?

06:26.086 --> 06:28.086
Okay, Marco, I know
you said no summoning,

06:28.088 --> 06:30.589
but we summoned,
we summoned Hungry Larry.

06:30.591 --> 06:31.890
You what?!

06:31.892 --> 06:33.492
Oh, Chill, Marco.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.093
Everyone's having
a great time.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.162
Can't you hear
all those bloodcurdling screams?

06:37.164 --> 06:38.997
( silence )

06:38.999 --> 06:40.832
I don't hear
anything, Star.

06:56.682 --> 06:58.717
Candy.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.952
Uh, no duh.
It's Halloween.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.189
This is saliva.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.494
Hungry Larry?

07:11.631 --> 07:13.031
( screams )

07:13.033 --> 07:14.933
Where's Hungry Larry?

07:14.935 --> 07:19.438
He's... still... hungry.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.173
( kids screaming )

07:22.442 --> 07:27.078
KIDS: I'm still hungry.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.447
What the...
Hungry for what?

07:28.449 --> 07:30.148
Marco!

07:30.150 --> 07:31.983
( splashing )

07:36.055 --> 07:40.158
KIDS ( whispering ):
I'm still hungry.

07:40.160 --> 07:43.061
( voices echoing )

07:49.001 --> 07:50.802
GIRL: I'm still...

07:50.804 --> 07:52.337
KIDS: ...hungry.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.206
( shrieking )

07:57.743 --> 07:59.811
( loud metal music plays )

08:15.027 --> 08:16.995
Oh, no, no, no.

08:16.997 --> 08:21.199
( blow-up doll groaning )

08:29.175 --> 08:31.610
Honey, I'm... I'm sorry.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.913
I thought this year
was going to be different.

08:36.215 --> 08:37.816
Honey?

08:37.818 --> 08:39.751
Kids?

08:41.153 --> 08:44.523
Marco, Marco, Marc... oh!

08:49.362 --> 08:51.263
Wet ceiling.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.569
Oh!

08:57.571 --> 08:59.671
Kids.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.474
( eerie voices )
They're in here.

09:10.149 --> 09:12.050
Who are you?

09:12.052 --> 09:14.252
( many voices )
I'm Hungry...

09:14.254 --> 09:17.556
( clears throat )

09:17.558 --> 09:19.691
( one voice )
I'm Hungry Larry.

09:19.693 --> 09:22.661
I've been summoned here
to haunt your home,

09:22.663 --> 09:26.998
because you're
not scary.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.234
But where is my family?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.870
I told you.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.104
They're in...

09:33.106 --> 09:35.006
( many voices )
...here.

09:35.008 --> 09:37.275
- Help!
- Get us out of here!

09:37.277 --> 09:38.276
Kids!

09:38.278 --> 09:41.446
Oh, your wife
is in here, too.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.515
Um, uh, somewhere.

09:43.517 --> 09:45.116
She's pretty.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.285
Oh. Thank you.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.955
I would eat you, too,

09:49.957 --> 09:52.524
but I'm stuffed.

09:52.526 --> 09:56.861
So, uh,
count your blessings.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.129
I guess.

09:58.131 --> 10:01.866
But my family
is my blessings.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.868
Oh.

10:03.870 --> 10:08.273
What I meant to say was,
<i>get out!!</i>

10:19.318 --> 10:24.189
Give me back
my family!

10:37.637 --> 10:40.271
( girl shrieking )

10:40.273 --> 10:42.173
( all screaming )

11:00.092 --> 11:02.193
Aww!

11:02.195 --> 11:03.695
Mr. Diaz!

11:03.697 --> 11:06.131
You were terrifying
in there.

11:06.133 --> 11:09.701
Best Halloween ever!

11:09.703 --> 11:11.836
Yeah, Dad,
that was amazing.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.304
It's like I always say.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.173
Nothing more terrifying

11:15.175 --> 11:16.808
than a man
who has lost everything.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.510
Leave this place.

11:22.181 --> 11:25.283
LARRY: How rude. Whatever.

11:44.503 --> 11:46.071
Oh, man!

11:47.406 --> 11:49.240
( coughing and groaning )

11:49.242 --> 11:52.711
We got chewed up
and spit out.

11:52.713 --> 11:55.146
Why the sour
word play, guys?

11:55.148 --> 11:56.915
How about some
Cold Ones

11:56.917 --> 11:58.383
for my number ones?

11:58.385 --> 12:01.352
Yeah, you're all
my number ones. Ha ha!

12:01.354 --> 12:03.354
You're number one,
Spider.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.490
I don't know why you guys
are acting all sore,

12:05.492 --> 12:07.559
because the battle I saw
was like,

12:07.561 --> 12:09.260
"Oh, I'm Mr. Bad Guy.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.362
I'm gonna eat up
the childrens."

12:11.364 --> 12:13.431
And then the warnicorns
came in and were all, like,

12:13.433 --> 12:15.266
( roaring )

12:15.268 --> 12:18.403
and the bad guy was, like,
"I didn't mean any harm."

12:18.405 --> 12:20.271
He is totally right.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.173
No, no!

12:24.410 --> 12:26.010
( laughing )

12:26.012 --> 12:29.414
And, the <i>piece de resistance,</i>

12:29.416 --> 12:32.083
that Narwhal Blast!

12:32.085 --> 12:34.252
( yelling )

12:34.254 --> 12:36.421
( laughing and cheering )

12:36.423 --> 12:38.757
STAR: <i>Toothpaste</i>
<i>tidal blast!</i>

12:38.759 --> 12:41.259
You're up, bud.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.597
Looks like Star's
getting ready for bed.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.865
See you guys
in the morning.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.299
Night, dude.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.400
Night.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.802
( gibberish )

12:50.804 --> 12:53.471
Hey, Spider, we all
really appreciate you.

12:53.473 --> 12:57.809
Everything we do is the most
important life or death
situation all the time,

12:57.811 --> 13:01.045
and it's nice to be greeted
with something frivolous,

13:01.047 --> 13:03.715
something light.
See you in the morning, bud.

13:03.717 --> 13:06.117
Hey, Narwhal.

13:06.119 --> 13:09.320
For real, how do you do
that Narwhal Blast?

13:09.322 --> 13:11.122
It's easy.
You hear the call,

13:11.124 --> 13:13.758
and your warrior spell
instincts kick in.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.361
It's like...
Narwhal Blast!

13:17.930 --> 13:20.732
But hey, I like
the way you do it.

13:20.734 --> 13:22.367
Good night.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.913
Spider with a top hat
blast!

13:39.318 --> 13:41.152
I will break you.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.189
Spider with a top hat
blast!

13:45.257 --> 13:48.026
Blast!
Top hat blast!

13:48.028 --> 13:49.494
Top hat blast!

13:49.496 --> 13:52.697
Top hat blast!
Top hat blast!

13:52.699 --> 13:56.034
Top hat blast!

13:56.036 --> 13:57.936
( alarm clock buzzing )

13:57.938 --> 13:59.537
( groaning )

13:59.539 --> 14:01.706
( buzzing continues )

14:01.708 --> 14:03.775
( groaning )

14:15.221 --> 14:18.523
Rise and shine.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.693
Whoo! Whoo hoo!

14:25.531 --> 14:26.698
Yeah!

14:26.700 --> 14:29.334
Morning!

14:29.336 --> 14:32.203
Whee!

14:34.406 --> 14:36.407
Oh, everyone's happy.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.509
( all exclaiming )

14:38.511 --> 14:40.912
Morning spells.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.213
Ooh.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.548
( all gasping )

14:45.351 --> 14:48.453
Oh. Ow!

14:52.892 --> 14:54.926
Ow.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.161
( cracking )

14:57.163 --> 14:59.230
Ow. Ow.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.933
Are you okay?
What happened
to your leg?

15:01.935 --> 15:03.601
I'm fine.
I just slept funny.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.404
Oh, Spider, everything
you do is funny.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.539
( giggling )

15:08.541 --> 15:10.708
Let's curl it!

15:10.710 --> 15:14.245
( straining )

15:14.247 --> 15:16.714
Hey, Rock, can I work out
a few sets with you?

15:16.716 --> 15:19.217
It's Spider!

15:19.219 --> 15:20.852
So you wanna work out
with the big dogs?

15:20.854 --> 15:23.621
Start with a one-ounce
and a two-ounce.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.024
Actually, I want
a big weight like
you guys.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.592
Oh, yeah, well,
you should probably

15:27.594 --> 15:29.527
leave the big weights
to us, Spider dog.

15:29.529 --> 15:30.795
But I can do it.

15:30.797 --> 15:34.032
Uh, well, he does have
the headband. Okay.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.467
Let 'er rip, boys.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.269
( struggling )

15:38.271 --> 15:40.438
I'm doin' it, guys!

15:40.440 --> 15:41.706
Guys, look.
I'm doin' it.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.474
Uh, we haven't let go
of it yet.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.209
( straining )

15:45.211 --> 15:46.711
Oh, well, come on,
let it go then.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.449
Spider? You good?

15:51.451 --> 15:54.319
Uh... how do you do it?

15:54.321 --> 15:56.554
Take that kind of punishment
every day

15:56.556 --> 15:57.989
and go back for more?

15:57.991 --> 16:00.224
I don't know.
Push through the pain, I guess.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.760
Yeah, I kinda
like the pain.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.329
Pain!

16:04.331 --> 16:06.064
Pain!

16:06.066 --> 16:07.632
BOTH: Pain!

16:09.301 --> 16:12.971
Spider with a top hat blast!

16:12.973 --> 16:15.406
Get up, Spider.

16:15.408 --> 16:18.509
Push through the pain.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.145
Is that the face
of a quitter?

16:21.147 --> 16:23.181
No!!

16:23.183 --> 16:24.749
( mirror shatters )

16:24.751 --> 16:26.784
Warrior spirit!

16:26.786 --> 16:30.555
Spider with
a top hat blast!

16:32.658 --> 16:37.595
Spider with a... top hat.

16:37.597 --> 16:38.563
Huh?

16:40.866 --> 16:42.700
( gasps )

16:44.470 --> 16:45.670
Spider.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.672
Narwhal, I got
something to show you.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.507
All right, what is it?

16:53.479 --> 16:56.047
Spider with
a top hat blast!

16:56.049 --> 16:59.384
Dude, that's hilarious.
( raucous laughter )

16:59.386 --> 17:01.719
No. I'm being serious.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.355
Oh, I thought
you were kidding.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.325
Look, singing and dancing
is great,

17:07.327 --> 17:09.794
but fighting,
you could get hurt.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.529
Or worse.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.631
You could get
Star killed.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.801
Good night.
( crying )

17:16.803 --> 17:18.970
Hey, Spider.
Come on.

17:18.972 --> 17:21.739
Honey, is everything
all right?

17:21.741 --> 17:24.142
- I hope so.
- ( baby cries )

17:24.144 --> 17:25.543
( groaning )

17:25.545 --> 17:27.412
( coughs )

17:27.414 --> 17:29.747
11:30?
We overslept.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.916
I gotta get
to work, honey.

17:31.918 --> 17:34.419
- Everybody up.
- This isn't good, guys.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.754
- Where's Spider, dog?
- What happened to Spider?

17:36.756 --> 17:38.656
He didn't
wake us up.

17:45.097 --> 17:48.433
Uh, Spider,
you okay?

17:48.435 --> 17:50.568
You're acting funny.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.839
Not like funny-funny.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.942
Like something's wrong-funny.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.578
Everyone's really
worried about you,
especially me.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.047
Yeah, we missed
your morning dance number
with the bubbles.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.116
Yeah, and the lights.

18:05.118 --> 18:08.453
What? Did I fail
to entertain you?

18:08.455 --> 18:11.089
Um, yes, you did.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.758
Well, I'm sorry if I don't
feel like being

18:13.760 --> 18:16.727
your little
dancing clown today.

18:16.729 --> 18:19.630
Fine. We'll make
our own coffee.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.466
STAR: <i>Cupcake blast!</i>

18:23.602 --> 18:25.903
Come on, Spider.
What's up?

18:25.905 --> 18:28.206
All of my life,
I've had this crazy dream,

18:28.208 --> 18:30.608
and now, the dream is dead.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.743
STAR: <i>Emerald snake strike!</i>

18:32.745 --> 18:34.645
<i>Honeybee tornado swarm!</i>

18:34.647 --> 18:36.614
<i>Flying pig blast!</i>

18:36.616 --> 18:38.549
Wow, that's a lot
of spells at once.

18:38.551 --> 18:41.752
<i>Mega Narwhal blast!</i>

18:41.754 --> 18:43.454
Whoa, whoa!

18:43.456 --> 18:44.822
MAKEUP BLAST: Sweetheart?

18:44.824 --> 18:46.491
He'll be fine.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.226
It's not a big deal until
she calls out the--

18:48.228 --> 18:50.628
<i>Warnicorn stampede!</i>

18:51.763 --> 18:54.499
<i>Bean bag monster</i>
<i>metamorphosis!</i>

18:54.501 --> 18:56.634
<i>Toothpaste tidal blast!</i>

18:56.636 --> 18:58.836
Wait, those aren't
even warrior spells.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.639
This has never
happened before.
What do we do?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.508
<i>Makeup Blast!</i>

19:07.679 --> 19:10.915
Is anyone left?
Hello?

19:13.185 --> 19:14.785
Rock!

19:14.787 --> 19:16.420
( groaning )

19:16.422 --> 19:18.823
Star's calling you next.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.458
But I'm just
an entertainment spell.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.926
I can't fight.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.495
You have fire
in you, Spider.

19:24.497 --> 19:28.132
I hear you in there,
throwing yourself
at that wall every night.

19:28.134 --> 19:32.136
( coughing ) You've got
the hat of a warrior.

19:32.138 --> 19:33.704
Hat?

19:33.706 --> 19:36.707
Wait. No, I mean heart.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.876
You've got
the heart of a warrior, bro.

19:38.878 --> 19:42.046
You just gotta
dig deep to find it.

19:42.048 --> 19:44.882
( coughing )

19:44.884 --> 19:46.484
No!!

19:46.486 --> 19:48.786
I can't do this alone.

19:48.788 --> 19:52.390
<i>Spider with</i>
<i>a top hat blast!</i>

20:02.701 --> 20:07.872
( crying )
Where's Rainbow Fist?

20:07.874 --> 20:10.074
I can't see.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.709
I can't see!

20:11.711 --> 20:12.944
Spider, you have to help--

20:16.148 --> 20:18.482
Bean bag!

20:18.484 --> 20:21.185
A spider with a top hat?
How is that gonna help?

20:21.187 --> 20:22.920
Marco!

20:22.922 --> 20:25.256
( ferocious roar )

20:25.258 --> 20:26.624
( Star screams )

20:31.029 --> 20:32.863
( coughing )

20:32.865 --> 20:34.365
Bro, remember
what I told you.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.767
You have the hat
of a warrior.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.814
Uh, I'm Spider with a top hat.

20:54.286 --> 20:57.421
And a laser cannon.

20:57.423 --> 21:01.225
War cry!!

21:23.048 --> 21:24.815
( groaning )
Star?

21:24.817 --> 21:27.652
Spider with a top hat did it!

21:27.654 --> 21:31.622
My little top hat,
strongest spell I've got.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.495
You did great
out there, Spider.

21:37.497 --> 21:38.796
( all cheering )

21:38.798 --> 21:41.799
Any time you wanna get
pumped up with us,

21:41.801 --> 21:43.634
it's okay with me.
