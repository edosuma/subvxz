WEBVTT

00:04.462 --> 00:06.171
Can I see the comics?

00:06.631 --> 00:08.257
This is the New York Times.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.593
Okay, may I see the comics?

00:13.221 --> 00:15.764
I thought you were
taking Ross to the game.

00:15.974 --> 00:19.268
- We are. He's meeting us here.
- No, Rachel's meeting us here.

00:19.477 --> 00:21.311
Come on.
They can be in the same room.

00:21.563 --> 00:24.481
- You should've been there last night.
- What happened?

00:24.691 --> 00:26.358
Ross was hanging out at our place.

00:26.609 --> 00:29.069
Rachel comes to borrow
moisturizer from Chandler...

00:29.279 --> 00:30.279
Hey.

00:31.364 --> 00:33.032
How hard is it to say "something"?

00:33.283 --> 00:36.535
Rachel came over to borrow "something."

00:37.871 --> 00:41.248
Anyway, her and Ross just started
yelling at each other.

00:41.458 --> 00:44.918
Why was he yelling at her?
He slept with someone else.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.421
He says they were on a break
when it happened...

00:47.630 --> 00:49.465
...so she should've
forgiven him by now.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.718
He is so unreasonable. God.

00:52.969 --> 00:55.054
Although I understand what he means.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.974
Oh, my God.
This is like 60 Minutes...

00:59.184 --> 01:02.102
...when at first you're mad
at that pharmaceutical company...

01:02.270 --> 01:03.270
...for making the drug.

01:03.438 --> 01:06.148
And then, you just feel bad
for the people because...

01:06.357 --> 01:08.942
...they needed
to make their hair grow.

01:09.360 --> 01:12.821
You know, this is like
when my parents got divorced.

01:13.323 --> 01:16.200
I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me
after Cub Scouts.

01:18.328 --> 01:22.247
I dreamed that Ross and Rachel
were still together.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.416
And we were all
hanging out and happy.

01:24.667 --> 01:25.834
I had the same dream.

01:26.044 --> 01:30.756
- And nobody slept with the Xerox girl.
- Oh, I had the opposite dream.

01:31.883 --> 01:34.927
Maybe it's gonna be okay.
I mean, it's been a week.

01:35.136 --> 01:37.805
It never takes me more than a week
to get over a relationship.

01:38.014 --> 01:41.141
It never takes you more than a shower
to get over a relationship.

01:44.145 --> 01:47.648
Let's go. Let's hit the road.
Let's get the show on it.

01:47.899 --> 01:48.899
Let me get coffee.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.151
I know the best coffeehouse.
And it's close.

01:51.820 --> 01:52.861
Closer than here?

01:53.655 --> 01:55.823
Oh, look. I found coffee.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.449
Okay, let's skedaddle.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.160
I'm not gonna drink
somebody's old coffee.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.995
Okay, Your Highness.

02:09.753 --> 02:14.049
"Rachel, I'm really sorry."
"Okay, Ross. Wanna get back together?"

02:14.217 --> 02:15.259
"Yeah, okay."

02:15.677 --> 02:17.886
Did anyone else hear that?

03:18.364 --> 03:19.448
- Is he here?
- No.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.450
Here's your moisturizer.

03:23.745 --> 03:24.786
Hi.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.081
You guys are gonna love me.
Okay, check it out.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.167
Thursday night, five tickets.

03:30.376 --> 03:34.755
Calvin Klein lingerie show,
and you guys are coming with me.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.177
I said that out loud, right?

03:40.678 --> 03:43.972
Yes, it's just that
we kind of already...

03:44.224 --> 03:46.225
...made plans with Ross.

03:47.685 --> 03:50.604
Oh. Well, okay.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.189
Well, there you go.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.775
It's just, he got this new
home-theater dealy...

03:54.984 --> 03:56.902
...and he wants us to check it out.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.779
He's excited about it too.

03:59.030 --> 04:02.074
He even recorded showtimes
on his answering machine.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.618
- We're sorry, honey.
- Oh, it's okay.

04:04.869 --> 04:08.330
Rach, it's not that
we don't want to. Really.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.959
Are we talking models
in their underwear?

04:12.627 --> 04:13.669
And heels.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.841
Ross did ask us first,
and we set that night aside.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.429
Come on. If he asked you first,
it's only fair.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.435
Oh, boy, do I feel bad.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.312
Very bad.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.356
- Chandler, what are you doing?
- Chandler.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.109
Oh, my God.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.403
You're smoking again?

04:39.654 --> 04:42.322
Well, actually,
yesterday I was smoking again.

04:42.573 --> 04:43.865
Today I'm smoking, still.

04:44.951 --> 04:48.620
Why would you start again
after chewing all that quitting gum?

04:48.830 --> 04:51.540
This is just like
my parents' divorce...

04:51.749 --> 04:54.042
...which is when
I first started smoking.

04:55.211 --> 04:56.753
Weren't you 9?

04:58.756 --> 04:59.798
Yeah.

05:02.427 --> 05:06.305
I'm telling you something,
that first smoke after naptime...

05:08.599 --> 05:10.684
That's great.
With my luck, that's him.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.311
Him? Ross?

05:12.520 --> 05:16.189
No, "Hymn" 253:
"His Eyes Are on the Sparrow."

05:18.192 --> 05:22.571
When my parents got divorced, I started
using humor as a defense mechanism.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.285
Hi. Uh, do you guys have
weekend plans?

05:28.494 --> 05:33.623
Because my sister says we can spend
the weekend at her cabin, skiing.

05:34.751 --> 05:38.253
I'm asking you first, right?
I'm playing by the rules.

05:38.504 --> 05:39.671
Absolutely.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.841
Chandler. You're smoking?
What are you doing?

05:43.092 --> 05:45.344
Shut up.
You're not my real mom.

05:51.851 --> 05:55.729
Could you close that window?
My nipples could cut glass.

05:58.941 --> 06:01.526
Really? Because mine
get me out of tickets.

06:04.238 --> 06:09.284
Look, I just wanna say I really
appreciate you spending time with me.

06:09.494 --> 06:13.622
It's been a hard time right now,
so I just want to say thanks.

06:13.831 --> 06:17.000
Somebody else hug him.
I have to stay by the window.

06:19.295 --> 06:20.379
Oh, hey, hey.

06:20.630 --> 06:24.341
How about this weekend, we have
a laser-disc marathon, okay?

06:24.592 --> 06:27.636
And maybe a tournament
on my new...

06:28.763 --> 06:31.264
...dart board. What do you think?

06:31.474 --> 06:33.892
Two days of darts. It'll be great.

06:35.853 --> 06:37.270
It'll be great for next weekend.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.147
This weekend, guys.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.441
It'll be great for next weekend.

06:41.692 --> 06:44.319
I mean, "it'll be great."

06:47.448 --> 06:48.490
What's going on?

06:48.741 --> 06:53.745
We're, um, sort of invited to go skiing.
You know, Rachel's sister's cabin?

06:57.333 --> 06:59.960
So, for the whole weekend?

07:00.461 --> 07:03.880
We're really sorry,
but she did ask us first.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.343
That's okay. If you
all have to go away...

07:08.553 --> 07:11.430
...for the first weekend I'm
alone by myself...

07:11.639 --> 07:13.473
...then I totally understand.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.268
I can stay. I'm gonna stay.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.980
The last time I went,
I was afraid to leave the chair lift.

07:20.189 --> 07:21.857
I just went round and round.

07:23.109 --> 07:26.361
We need you to drive us there
in your grandmother's cab.

07:26.571 --> 07:31.283
- But you know what? I'll stay.
- No, I'll stay. He's my brother.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.535
- What, a "pity stay"?
- No.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.663
We're gonna have fun.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.999
We can make fudge.

07:41.252 --> 07:42.544
Pity food?

07:43.629 --> 07:46.465
You know what?
I don't need any of you to stay.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.091
Nobody stays.

07:48.384 --> 07:50.927
Well, then I might as well
offer to stay.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.227
Hey...

07:59.479 --> 08:01.813
Does anybody else feel bad about Ross?

08:02.064 --> 08:03.273
You think he's still mad?

08:03.483 --> 08:07.694
He's probably more mad since
you called him to borrow his goggles.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.529
What? Mine aren't tinted.

08:12.867 --> 08:13.867
Chandler.

08:14.243 --> 08:15.243
What?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.537
What does the sign say?

08:19.040 --> 08:21.291
"Beam me up, Jesus."

08:22.126 --> 08:23.585
The "No Smoking" sign.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.505
There's no smoking
in my grandmother's cab.

08:27.215 --> 08:30.050
Well, then I have to go
to the bathroom.

08:30.384 --> 08:31.927
Oh, please.

08:32.135 --> 08:35.054
No unscheduled stops.
You can go when we stop for gas.

08:35.264 --> 08:39.893
There's a rest stop right up there.
Come on, I really have to go.

08:42.395 --> 08:44.022
Oh, now I have to go.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.448
Here we go.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.283
- Brace yourself.
- What?

08:56.827 --> 08:58.578
Okay. Ow.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.920
- Aren't you gonna go?
- No, thanks.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.839
Rachel never pees in public restrooms.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.592
They never have any paper in there.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.679
So my rule is, "No tissue, no tushy."

09:22.144 --> 09:24.479
Well, if everybody's going...

09:25.606 --> 09:27.983
Don't close it.
The keys are in there.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.568
Oh, no, no, no, no.

09:30.152 --> 09:32.654
- What's going on?
- My lighter's in there.

09:39.370 --> 09:42.372
Damn. The tailpipe's
not hot enough to light this.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.751
I can open this.
Anybody got a coat hanger?

09:46.919 --> 09:47.961
Oh, I do.

09:48.170 --> 09:51.715
No, I took it out of my shirt
when I put it on this morning.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.468
So if your parents hadn't divorced...

09:55.678 --> 09:58.972
...you'd be able to answer a question
like a normal person?

10:00.725 --> 10:04.227
Look, I just need a wire something
to jimmy it.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.521
One of you give me
your bra underwire.

10:06.731 --> 10:07.897
What?

10:08.816 --> 10:11.276
Come on.
Who has the biggest boobs?

10:12.820 --> 10:16.406
Whoever has the biggest boobs,
has the biggest bra and wire.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.283
- No.
- It's too expensive.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.953
To get back in the car,
we need that wire.

10:22.204 --> 10:23.413
Your call.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.585
Monica's are the biggest.

10:30.963 --> 10:35.258
These tiny little non-breasts?
Please. It's gotta be Rachel.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.428
No, mine are deceptively small.

10:38.679 --> 10:42.432
I mean, I actually sometimes
stuff my bra.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.519
Well, then your bra would
still be big.

10:46.729 --> 10:49.189
No, I stuff outside the bra.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.484
Ladies, let's just compromise, okay?

10:52.735 --> 10:55.070
Phoebe, Rachel,
take off Monica's bra.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.989
All right, forget it, never mind.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.116
- You can have mine.
- Thank you.

11:02.870 --> 11:06.122
Chandler. What are you doing?
There's a trash can right there.

11:06.791 --> 11:10.919
I thought if I littered, that crying
Indian might come by and save us.

11:13.881 --> 11:14.923
There.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.885
Thank you, Phoebe.
That's very, very generous.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.971
Now, let's decide
who has the nicest ass.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.226
And there you go.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.232
Chandler.

11:32.483 --> 11:35.527
Well, at least let me smoke it
to the good part.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.121
Oh, no.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.958
- What's going on?
- What?

11:50.209 --> 11:52.627
Yeah, this has happened before.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.798
- So you know how to fix it?
- Yep. Put more gas in.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.642
Hi. What are you doing here?

12:07.893 --> 12:10.186
I was wondering,
when you and I split up...

12:10.438 --> 12:14.524
...did you get the tape that was
half the last episode of M.A.S. H...

12:14.734 --> 12:16.943
...and half the hostages coming home?

12:18.362 --> 12:22.031
But now it's Susan and me in Mexico
and the hostages coming home.

12:22.491 --> 12:23.533
Where's Ben?

12:23.743 --> 12:24.993
- He's sleeping.
- Ah. Ooh.

12:27.204 --> 12:29.122
Is this a bad time?

12:29.373 --> 12:32.167
Yeah, actually.
Susan's gonna be here any minute.

12:32.376 --> 12:34.544
- It's kind of an anniversary.
- Oh.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.172
I thought you guys
got married in January.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.090
A different kind of anniversary.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.343
Oh.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.638
So anyway...

12:45.890 --> 12:47.807
Candles, champagne...

12:48.184 --> 12:50.602
Yeah, anniversaries are great...

12:51.103 --> 12:53.605
...because love lasts forever,
you know?

12:54.440 --> 12:57.692
There's nothing like it
in this life. Money in the bank.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.694
So Rachel and I broke up.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.782
God, Ross, I am so sorry.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.284
You know what?

13:06.535 --> 13:08.578
I wanna talk about this so much...

13:08.788 --> 13:11.080
...but when we can really get into it.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.583
- You free for dinner tomorrow?
- I'd love that.

13:13.751 --> 13:14.751
Me too.

13:14.919 --> 13:18.588
I guess it all started
when Rachel got this new job.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.967
Triple A can pick us up.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.136
What town are we near?

13:25.387 --> 13:27.514
Freemont. Westmont.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.140
Uh, Westberg?

13:29.350 --> 13:31.267
Why are you answering?

13:32.478 --> 13:34.187
Do you know
what route we're on?

13:34.438 --> 13:37.440
We are definitely on Route 27.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.652
We are at a rest stop on Route 27...

13:40.861 --> 13:42.612
There is no Route 27.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.365
- Either 93 or 76.
- I don't know.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.117
I always slept in the back
when we drove here.

13:49.286 --> 13:54.040
Can you just send someone up and down
76 and check every rest stop?

13:54.291 --> 13:56.084
And also 93?

13:57.545 --> 13:58.670
Okay.

13:58.879 --> 14:00.171
No, they don't do that.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.677
Somebody will come and save us.

14:05.928 --> 14:09.264
Who? Have you seen a car
in the last hour and a half?

14:09.515 --> 14:12.600
We should call Ross.
Maybe he can get a car to get us.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.103
I am not getting in a car with Ross.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.063
We will just have to...

14:17.231 --> 14:18.231
...live here.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.234
- But it's so cold.
- No.

14:21.443 --> 14:24.904
I won't get in a car with him.
Think of something else.

14:25.155 --> 14:26.656
Joey and Chandler are back.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.203
- So the going-for-help went well?
- Oh, yeah.

14:32.663 --> 14:36.541
Smokey Joe here got halfway
to the highway and collapsed.

14:36.750 --> 14:39.043
I have the lung capacity
of a 2-year-old.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.170
Then why are you smoking?

14:41.380 --> 14:42.755
It's very unsettling.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.845
Right? I mean,
it's pretty unbelievable.

14:49.096 --> 14:52.682
They just took off
without even looking back.

14:53.517 --> 14:56.895
I don't need them.
I've got you guys now as friends.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.229
You and Susan.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.149
Susan will be so pleased.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.861
Seven-one-seven?

15:05.070 --> 15:06.571
Where's 717?

15:09.325 --> 15:11.409
You have more of these
for Susan, right?

15:11.660 --> 15:13.119
No, but that's okay.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.955
I'll just put out pickles
or something.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.045
- Ross, thank God.
- Pheebs?

15:22.254 --> 15:23.755
Why are you whispering?

15:24.298 --> 15:26.215
I ate a bug.

15:27.384 --> 15:30.136
Hey, Rach. The tampons here
are only a penny.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.013
Let's stock up.

15:33.098 --> 15:37.393
We're out of gas and don't know where
we are, so we can't get a tow truck.

15:37.728 --> 15:41.397
- Oh. Now you want a favor?
- Yes, please.

15:41.565 --> 15:44.108
I'm sorry your
car broke down, Pheebs...

15:44.360 --> 15:47.570
...but I'm too busy with some of
my real friends right now.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.573
But please call to let me know
you got home safely.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.659
Phoebe, hang on a second.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.619
Take my car.
Get your friends.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.454
No, I won't pick them up.

15:56.705 --> 15:59.666
We both know you'll do it
because you're not a jerk.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.877
So you can sulk here for half an hour,
then go get them...

16:03.128 --> 16:06.047
...or save time and sulk in the car.
- Rachel doesn't...

16:06.298 --> 16:08.466
I'm sorry Rachel dumped you for Mark...

16:08.676 --> 16:11.219
...and you're the innocent victim
in this.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.263
But don't punish your friends
for what Rachel did.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.892
Yeah, you're right.

16:18.519 --> 16:21.229
Phoebe, hang on.
Ross wants to say something.

16:21.438 --> 16:24.148
What? You slept with someone else?

16:26.068 --> 16:27.777
We were on a break.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.280
We were... Yeah.

16:31.448 --> 16:34.575
Where are you? I'll find you.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.285
You slept with another woman?

16:36.495 --> 16:39.122
Oh, you're one to talk.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.211
Okay, done.

16:47.464 --> 16:48.506
What's "pleh"?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.884
That's "help" spelled backwards...

16:52.094 --> 16:55.221
...so that the helicopters can read it
from the air.

16:56.473 --> 16:59.809
Ha. What's "dufus" spelled backwards?

17:02.479 --> 17:03.479
Car. Car.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.777
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.029
Hey.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.531
What is he doing here?

17:13.741 --> 17:15.657
He is saving your butt.

17:15.909 --> 17:18.036
Unless I'm stepping on
some toes here...

17:18.244 --> 17:20.079
...in which case,
I could just mosey on.

17:20.329 --> 17:22.790
I have plenty of people to help
on the interstate.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.376
- Come on.
- We need your help, please.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.545
Fine. Fine.

17:31.508 --> 17:35.053
Oh, no. Now it's
not gonna make any sense.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.014
You guys...

17:38.557 --> 17:41.517
...what do we do about Ross?
He drove all the way up here.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.020
Just send him back,
then we'll go skiing?

17:44.271 --> 17:47.148
This is horrible.
It's just horrible.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.942
Should we ask Ross to come along?

17:50.152 --> 17:53.237
But what about Rachel?
How are we gonna even ask her?

17:53.489 --> 17:55.073
Ask me what?

17:57.826 --> 18:00.661
If, uh, it might be okay if
Ross came skiing?

18:01.205 --> 18:03.623
No, I wasn't gonna ask that.

18:05.709 --> 18:08.753
You guys are unbelievable.
No, he cannot come.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.130
- Excuse me?
- It's horrible.

18:11.715 --> 18:16.594
Oh, please? Can't I come
to your special, magical cabin?

18:16.845 --> 18:20.515
Why would you even want to come?
You're a horrible skier.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.559
Oh. Hitting me where it hurts.
My ski skills.

18:24.645 --> 18:25.770
Here we go again.

18:25.979 --> 18:27.605
I can't handle this, you guys.

18:27.815 --> 18:30.024
I can handle it.
"Handle" is my middle name.

18:30.275 --> 18:33.861
Actually, it's the middle part
of my first name.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.657
All right, Pheebs, your cab's ready.

18:37.866 --> 18:38.866
Let's go.

18:39.576 --> 18:40.576
You're welcome.

18:40.828 --> 18:44.497
I'm sorry. Were you speaking
to me, or sleeping with someone else?

18:45.833 --> 18:47.083
We were on a break.

18:47.292 --> 18:50.878
Why don't you just put that
on your answering machine?

18:51.088 --> 18:53.881
It's valid, and I'm not the only one
who thinks so.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.299
Monica agrees with me.

18:56.051 --> 18:57.093
What?

18:58.053 --> 18:59.387
I don't know.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.098
You said it last night.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.768
What I said
was that I understood.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.771
Joey is the one who agreed with you.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.690
Really, Joey?

19:12.276 --> 19:13.276
What?

19:14.403 --> 19:17.488
You know what?
There is no right or wrong here.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.199
I think it's very obvious
who's wrong here.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.451
Obviously not to Joey.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.205
What?

19:27.040 --> 19:31.294
- Joey and Monica feel like I do.
- You and this innocent act.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.338
Hey, guess who I am?

19:40.888 --> 19:43.973
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.059
Look what you're doing to Chandler.

19:50.480 --> 19:54.358
Look. We know that this is
really, really hard for you guys.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.361
You don't have to love each other.

19:57.571 --> 20:01.240
You don't even have to like
each other much right now.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.285
But please find a way
to be around each other.

20:04.494 --> 20:07.121
And not put us in the middle.

20:07.331 --> 20:12.335
Otherwise, I mean, that's just it
for us hanging out together.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.587
Is that what you want?

20:16.506 --> 20:18.132
Can you be civil?

20:20.093 --> 20:22.511
- Yeah.
- I can.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.682
Good, let's get back in the car.
It's freezing...

20:26.934 --> 20:28.726
...and my chest is unsupported.

20:29.770 --> 20:30.895
Wait a second.

20:31.146 --> 20:33.940
I mean, what are we doing?
Who's going with who?

20:37.986 --> 20:40.696
Look, you guys should go.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.200
You know,
you planned this all out...

20:45.911 --> 20:48.412
...and I don't wanna ruin it.
So just go.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.706
- You drove all the way up here.
- No, no, no.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.209
I've gotta take
the car back anyway.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.670
I'm spending all day
tomorrow with Ben.

20:55.879 --> 21:00.049
It's fine, okay? Just go.
No guilt, I promise.

21:01.927 --> 21:02.969
Thank you.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.181
We'll call you when we get back.

21:07.849 --> 21:11.060
Maybe we can, like,
go to a movie or something.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.770
Or the rodeo.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.607
- That would be great.
- Okay.

21:17.901 --> 21:21.070
I was being Shelley Winters
from The Poseidon Adventure.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.156
I know.

21:32.749 --> 21:33.874
Bye.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.735
- Ross.
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.446
- Were you sleeping?
- Uh, no.

22:03.613 --> 22:04.989
Oh, great.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.452
I had to get you a new battery.
I got the best I could.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.495
You don't want to skimp there.

22:11.705 --> 22:12.830
You're a genius.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.540
It came to about $112.

22:14.791 --> 22:17.168
But what the hell,
call it an even 110?

22:18.587 --> 22:20.629
I'll pay you tomorrow. Bye.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.299
So they, uh, all took off.

22:23.550 --> 22:26.635
It was pretty hard
watching them go, you know?

22:26.887 --> 22:28.471
Yeah, okay. Bye.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.769
So I'm gonna take off then.
