<i>Previously on </i>The Right Stuff.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.604
You've seen us all up there
on that machine. What have you noticed?

00:20.687 --> 00:24.566
You're the slowest to react,
and you take the longest to recover.

00:25.984 --> 00:30.322
I wanna go into space,
and I'd like your husband to help.

00:31.073 --> 00:35.118
Jerrie Cobb is grooming a group of women
to be astronauts,

00:35.494 --> 00:37.287
and she asked me try out.

00:39.122 --> 00:42.668
- Al?
- I was with a girl. I saw a flash.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.378
A camera.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.960
I'm gonna take care of this.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.924
- Shorty, it's John.
- So, NASA knows about all this?

00:49.132 --> 00:50.509
This is about being first.

00:50.630 --> 00:54.231
I've saved your butt, Al! I've saved you!
I've saved all of you, damn it!

00:54.752 --> 00:56.640
So, this will be a peer vote.

00:57.301 --> 01:00.477
If you could not make the flight yourself,
who would you choose?

01:03.272 --> 01:06.316
Al Shepard doesn't deserve this.
I mean, he's selfish. He can't be trusted.

01:06.442 --> 01:07.943
<i>People need to know that.
People who can do something</i>

01:08.068 --> 01:09.486
<i>about it.</i>

01:10.435 --> 01:12.359
- How many more are there, John?
- I was only...

01:12.434 --> 01:16.535
You do realize the Manned Space Program
is hanging by a thread.

01:16.702 --> 01:17.996
Bob, I am trying to help you.

01:18.071 --> 01:20.122
I'm trying to keep you
from makin' a horrible mistake.

01:20.205 --> 01:24.960
- Al Shepard is unfit to serve.
- John, right now...

01:26.336 --> 01:28.964
you're the one who seems unfit.

01:33.135 --> 01:37.431
It's the Russians. I'm sorry, guys.
They put a man in orbit.

01:38.390 --> 01:39.391
Damn it.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.103
<i>Premier, Nikita Khrushchev,</i>

01:43.186 --> 01:44.646
<i>declared Russia's support today,</i>

01:45.105 --> 01:48.775
<i>for Communist leader, Fidel Castro,
promising to lend the Cuban people,</i>

01:48.942 --> 01:52.529
<i>all necessary assistance
in beating back rebel forces</i>

01:52.613 --> 01:56.867
<i>that have landed on a beach,
known as The Bay of Pigs. As...</i>

01:56.992 --> 02:00.037
- Well, that's World War III.
- What is Kennedy doing?

02:00.299 --> 02:01.705
First Gagarin, and now this.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.797
Been one hell of a damn week.

02:04.905 --> 02:07.044
<i>...delegates from across the globe,</i>

02:07.502 --> 02:11.548
<i>declaring that the United States
has committed no aggression against Cuba,</i>

02:11.673 --> 02:14.051
<i>and no offensive has been launched
from Florida</i>

02:14.134 --> 02:17.203
<i>or any other part of the United States.</i>

02:17.386 --> 02:20.057
Al, I'm real sorry
you're not the first man in space.

02:24.978 --> 02:29.441
No, you're not.

02:31.725 --> 02:35.155
<i>To be frank,
to have a disaster of this size occur,</i>

02:35.255 --> 02:37.549
<i>this early
in this president's administration,</i>

02:37.658 --> 02:41.536
<i>I'm not sure how he recovers.
But one thing is for certain,</i>

02:41.995 --> 02:43.409
<i>it's gonna have to be something...</i>

02:43.484 --> 02:44.539
<i>...extremely impressive...</i>

02:44.748 --> 02:46.627
<i>...nearly 6,000</i>

02:46.717 --> 02:48.608
<i>anti-Castro demonstrators...</i>

02:48.708 --> 02:50.129
<i>...braved fierce debating...</i>

02:55.676 --> 02:57.552
Get dressed and meet me downstairs.

02:58.470 --> 02:59.471
We got work to do.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.349
- Now?
- Now.

03:07.312 --> 03:10.440
The situation in Cuba is bad,
and it's getting worse every day.

03:11.152 --> 03:13.568
There's a lot of rumors out there
about the extent of our role,

03:13.652 --> 03:16.111
and whether it goes beyond
what the president's admitting, and...

03:16.586 --> 03:17.739
those rumors are true.

03:18.486 --> 03:20.928
The Cuban rebels, they were armed
and trained by our government.

03:21.003 --> 03:22.536
This is all gonna come out soon enough.

03:22.786 --> 03:25.956
The move against Castro
was an Eisenhower program.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.416
Kennedy didn't support it,

03:27.499 --> 03:29.386
but he also didn't have the guts
to pull the plug.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.713
- Sound familiar?
- He tried to play the middle,

03:33.380 --> 03:35.436
and he ended up
with egg on his face in Cuba.

03:36.091 --> 03:39.010
Same as he did with Gagarin
and the Russians beating us into space.

03:41.597 --> 03:43.266
You woke us up at four in the morning

03:43.366 --> 03:45.434
just to tell us
that the president is a coward?

03:46.476 --> 03:48.979
We woke you up to tell you
that he needs a win.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.941
And he has decided
that we are going to be that win.

03:53.389 --> 03:56.037
Gentlemen, he's willing to do
whatever it takes

03:56.111 --> 03:57.446
to make this launch a success.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.118
Now, the administration has not decided
when they're gonna announce

04:03.201 --> 04:05.954
the flight to the public, but chances are,
it won't be until afterwards,

04:06.325 --> 04:08.373
once they know that Al has landed safely.

04:09.494 --> 04:12.753
Kennedy might have grown a pair,
but they don't get big overnight.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.298
And, John, it's been decided
that you're the backup for this mission.

04:17.001 --> 04:18.008
When do I go up?

04:18.800 --> 04:21.178
Your mugs, gentlemen.

04:28.852 --> 04:29.853
Two weeks.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.202
<i>Oxygen?</i>

04:45.494 --> 04:46.745
Eleven hundred. Go.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.205
<i>Oxygen. Power?</i>

04:48.530 --> 04:51.241
<i>- Power.</i>
- Handle unlock.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.335
Capsule separated.

04:53.585 --> 04:56.755
<i>Rate control. Pilot on manual.</i>

04:56.995 --> 04:58.507
Yawing to the right.

04:58.799 --> 05:02.302
Roger that. You are go for retro sequence.
Thirty seconds on my mark.

05:02.386 --> 05:03.439
<i>Thirty seconds...</i>

05:03.514 --> 05:04.721
Understand. Go.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.766
I have a red fire retro light.

05:07.850 --> 05:08.959
Do you copy?

05:09.100 --> 05:11.812
Can you confirm that you've got ASCS
in fly-by-wire?

05:11.895 --> 05:14.606
I'm showing the spacecraft is tumbling.

05:14.683 --> 05:17.609
Should I be in retro attitude bypass?

05:17.734 --> 05:19.861
How long has that been on?

05:20.195 --> 05:21.780
Scott.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.949
- <i>Scott.</i>
- Uh, just give us a second, Al.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.700
Thirty seconds down.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.538
Should I be in retro attitude bypass?

05:30.539 --> 05:31.706
Scott.

05:32.197 --> 05:33.552
<i>Carpenter.</i>

05:39.798 --> 05:40.829
Yeah.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.634
Were you in retro fire position?

05:43.760 --> 05:47.430
What the hell just happened?

05:48.139 --> 05:50.100
You weren't in retro attitude
when we fired the...

05:50.183 --> 05:51.518
Then why the hell did you fire it?

05:52.215 --> 05:54.312
What is the point
of having manual controls

05:54.396 --> 05:56.731
if the ground fires the damn rocket
without me knowing?

05:57.352 --> 05:59.526
Well, Al,
I thought we checked the attitude,

05:59.609 --> 06:00.652
but I guess we didn't...

06:00.777 --> 06:02.529
so, I'm going back through to check it...

06:14.541 --> 06:15.542
Shut it down.

06:21.199 --> 06:23.018
Why'd you stop it?

06:23.174 --> 06:26.469
Because you've been on it longer
than anyone else, ever.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.560
What?

06:38.759 --> 06:39.858
I wanna show you somethin'.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.238
This is Jerrie Cobb.

06:46.791 --> 06:49.720
She's a famous pilot.
She's one of the best in the world.

06:50.327 --> 06:54.039
And she's putting together
a group of other pilots, all women...

06:55.071 --> 06:56.541
to train for going to space.

06:58.349 --> 07:00.545
And one of the other pilots is your mom.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.633
Wait, you're gonna be an astronaut?

07:06.085 --> 07:07.094
I hope so.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.597
Just like Dad?

07:12.766 --> 07:15.393
- What do you think about that?
- You're really gonna do it?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.627
Lady astronauts.

07:40.961 --> 07:46.257
Astronauts. Ass-tronauts, if you will.

07:46.466 --> 07:50.971
They're recruiting a whole team of them.

07:51.112 --> 07:52.987
You know what?
It might not be the worst idea.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.726
Why couldn't a woman go to space?

07:58.436 --> 08:00.438
Um, well...

08:00.730 --> 08:03.191
- Uh...
- Menstruation, for one thing.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.778
I won't even let Margie
drive the station wagon if I'm around.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.948
You should've seen what she did
to the neighbor's mailbox last month.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.866
Imagine if that had been a Skyray.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.535
Boys.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.412
- Two scotches, neat.
- Coming right up.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.746
- Send 'em down.
- Yes, sir.

08:18.081 --> 08:21.376
- We need to talk.
- Hi, Al.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.338
He never confirmed the attitude.

08:26.673 --> 08:27.966
You could have done it yourself.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.218
If you want me taking my cues
from the ground,

08:30.301 --> 08:33.138
we both could use a man we trust
on CAPCOM. Now...

08:35.098 --> 08:37.350
I have nothing against Scott, personally.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.978
But this is not his first screw-up.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.857
He's not ready, and you know it.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.484
Yeah...

08:46.568 --> 08:47.777
It's not my call.

08:50.739 --> 08:53.700
I'll run it up the flagpole.
That's the best that I can do.

08:54.034 --> 08:58.621
Chris.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.126
There's something else
we need to talk about.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.260
Where did you get this?

09:13.928 --> 09:16.389
John Glenn is not the only one
who knows important people.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.184
He's been warned.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.561
He knows to stand down.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.313
Let it go.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.817
Chris... John is talented.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.195
He belongs in the program.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.365
But put yourself in my shoes.
He's my backup.

09:35.575 --> 09:40.538
He'll be the one checking the straps
on my seat as I load into that capsule.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.874
And now, I find out
that he's been going around

09:42.957 --> 09:44.555
trying to stab me in the damn back?

09:46.377 --> 09:47.378
We took your side.

09:48.665 --> 09:49.673
You won.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.258
You're going to space.

10:02.811 --> 10:07.273
<i>I'm a travelin' man
I've made a lot of stops...</i>

10:07.482 --> 10:12.821
<i>...All over the world, and in every part</i>

10:12.946 --> 10:14.656
<i>I own the heart...</i>

10:14.739 --> 10:17.367
<i>- ...Of at least one lovely girl...</i>
- Scotty?

10:19.045 --> 10:20.078
What's wrong with you?

10:21.191 --> 10:22.703
It looks like someone shot your puppy.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.166
I need your help.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.586
Al got me taken off CAPCOM.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.631
Demoted to flying chase.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.137
Well, I'm real sorry, Scott.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.348
John... you're connected.

10:41.056 --> 10:44.654
Everyone respects you. Gilruth, Kraft,
James Webb, they'll listen to you.

10:44.727 --> 10:45.728
Shepard's right.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.399
You weren't prepared.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.693
Shepard's an arrogant asshole.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.444
- You, of all people, know that.
- Maybe.

10:54.962 --> 10:56.614
But he is putting his life
on the line here.

10:57.282 --> 11:02.996
<i>...When we walked in the sands
Of the Waikiki and I held you, oh, so...</i>

11:03.079 --> 11:04.247
I think you're a good man.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.253
Better than the rest of these guys.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.841
And, yeah...

11:15.930 --> 11:17.051
I think that matters.

11:18.678 --> 11:19.679
Or at least it ought to.

11:25.143 --> 11:28.313
- I told Rene how important it was...
- ...being CAPCOM.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.774
She was proud of me.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.902
She's coming down here for the flight.

11:37.443 --> 11:38.968
I don't know what to tell her now.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.620
It wasn't just Annie for me.

11:46.706 --> 11:50.835
Whole world thought I'd go first.
Still thinks, as a matter of fact.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.755
You know they're still taking bets
in Vegas, right?

11:54.672 --> 11:55.757
Oh, yeah.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.135
I'm a two-to-one favorite, Scotty.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.511
Think about that.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.144
Can't just sit around crying,
though, can we?

12:09.657 --> 12:12.756
And you definitely can't go grousin' up
the chain of command.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.448
You're a Navy man...

12:22.659 --> 12:24.244
and I'm a United States Marine.

12:27.251 --> 12:29.582
So, what do you say we get our heads up
and start acting like it?

12:33.211 --> 12:34.212
Yeah.

12:45.556 --> 12:48.018
Thirty-five hours!

12:48.309 --> 12:52.772
<i>I got a rock and roll gal
And she rock and rolls all the time...</i>

12:55.066 --> 12:57.026
<i>...I got a rock and roll gal...</i>

12:57.110 --> 12:58.945
- Did you get something?
- I got one, thanks.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.029
Certainly.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.825
Evening, Major... Mrs. Glenn.

13:04.823 --> 13:05.827
Hello, Eunice.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.496
Hope you don't mind. I got you something.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.918
Saint Christopher...
patron saint of travelers.

13:15.517 --> 13:17.755
Thank you, Eunice, that's...

13:18.464 --> 13:19.966
...that is very thoughtful.

13:20.714 --> 13:22.218
We all know it's you, John.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.389
You'll be closer to the Lord
than any believing man's ever been.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.851
Get Him to bless this, will you?

13:30.435 --> 13:31.436
Yes, ma'am.

13:37.191 --> 13:42.280
She's a nice girl. She, uh... invited me
to a service at her church, so, uh...

13:47.201 --> 13:48.578
I know it's been hard for you...

13:49.996 --> 13:51.873
having to pretend.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.085
It'll get easier once everyone knows.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.379
I'm fine.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.132
It's really not so bad.

14:03.052 --> 14:05.734
But I do think I'm gonna go
for a little walk.

14:08.765 --> 14:09.807
Love you.

14:10.975 --> 14:15.772
<i>...Took the rocket that dark, cold night
The marquees read...</i>

14:15.907 --> 14:17.231
I wonder what that's about.

14:18.599 --> 14:22.487
I know John puts on a brave face,
but I think he's been hurt pretty bad

14:22.570 --> 14:23.571
since Al got picked.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.157
- Just like you?
- Well...

14:26.699 --> 14:29.535
I know how disappointed you were,
but you've handled it well,

14:29.619 --> 14:31.245
and that's why they picked you for CAPCOM.

14:33.539 --> 14:38.211
- Yeah. You should have a seat. Um...
- What happened?

14:40.463 --> 14:44.884
<i>I got a rock and roll gal
And she rock and rolls all the time.</i>

14:47.011 --> 14:52.683
<i>And if she keep on rockin'
I know she gonna lose her mind.</i>

15:00.078 --> 15:02.110
Just got a stack of requests
for press credentials.

15:02.649 --> 15:03.736
Three hundred of 'em.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.114
Kennedy's putting the launch
on national TV live.

15:07.949 --> 15:10.952
- What?
- Live TV? No shit.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.954
Has everybody in D.C.
lost their goddamn minds?

15:13.037 --> 15:14.831
Hey! Take a breath.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.584
- You think this is the right choice?
- It's the only choice.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.712
We live in an open society
with a free press.

15:21.796 --> 15:24.029
We have to walk that walk
now more than ever.

15:24.966 --> 15:29.303
This fight with the Soviets
is about more than just science and bombs.

15:29.387 --> 15:31.207
- It's about...
- A war of ideas. Sure.

15:31.389 --> 15:34.308
Here's an idea for you.
We have no clue how many cosmonauts

15:34.419 --> 15:36.603
the Russians killed
before they sent Gagarin back alive.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.397
You're right. I don't know
how many tries it took the Soviets,

15:39.492 --> 15:41.372
but I know how many it's going to take us.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.568
Because I know our team.

15:44.003 --> 15:46.446
And I know we're better
than whoever the hell the Russians have.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.669
And I know we're ready.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.201
I sure as hell
hope you're right, 'cause if not,

15:52.326 --> 15:54.120
we're about throw Al
the most expensive funeral

15:54.203 --> 15:55.288
in the history of TV.

16:06.132 --> 16:09.177
Well, I guess Kennedy's nuts
are growing pretty damn fast after all.

16:10.261 --> 16:12.555
Let's just hope they don't get too big
for his britches.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.141
- Yeah.
<i>- Can you tell us</i>

16:15.397 --> 16:16.786
- who's goin' up?
- Come on, boys,

16:16.861 --> 16:18.530
you know I'm not allowed
to spill the beans.

16:19.223 --> 16:22.148
<i>And you'll see him when he walks out
of that hangar and gets in the capsule.</i>

16:22.232 --> 16:23.609
- That's Daddy.
<i>- So, then what...</i>

16:23.802 --> 16:24.984
<i>what else can I tell you about me?</i>

16:25.235 --> 16:27.079
It's been recently reported
that a group of women

16:27.153 --> 16:28.279
will train to go to space.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.407
Well, what do you men think about the idea
of female astronauts?

16:32.992 --> 16:37.163
Gordo has some strong opinions
on this one, don't you now, Gordo?

16:46.130 --> 16:48.633
We sent up a chimp, didn't we?

16:48.841 --> 16:54.680
May as well send up a lady someday.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.558
<i>The only problem is that the spacesuit
makes you look kind of plump,</i>

16:57.642 --> 16:59.143
<i>and we know the gals
aren't gonna like that.</i>

17:14.534 --> 17:16.058
One more, please.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.350
Thank you very much.

17:18.425 --> 17:20.153
Uh, I'll catch up with you all,
I just gotta...

18:06.502 --> 18:08.129
Clouds are getting lower in the west.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.340
It's a bad sign.

18:11.882 --> 18:15.511
- You're a weatherman now?
- Pilots know clouds.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.763
Pilots think they know everything.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.978
You better show me some respect,
Mrs. Shepard.

18:24.051 --> 18:25.656
I'm about to be a national hero.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.526
Once you're announced,

18:30.610 --> 18:32.903
I'll have to share you
with the whole world.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.699
Does that bother you?

18:37.992 --> 18:41.621
I was thinking about when you asked me
to that dance in college.

18:43.164 --> 18:47.293
- When you turned me down?
- No. I mean...

18:48.252 --> 18:49.754
when you showed up anyway.

18:50.296 --> 18:53.007
You just...

18:53.550 --> 18:57.345
you just walked straight up to me,
and started talking like you were my date,

18:57.435 --> 18:59.930
and I wasn't standing there
next to poor old George Dietz.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.557
Oh, God.

19:01.641 --> 19:06.062
Well, old George might have minded,
but you sure didn't seem to.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.189
Well, I did mind. It was rude.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.486
But I had never had anyone
pay attention to me like that.

19:14.728 --> 19:15.821
I knew what I wanted.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.701
But you didn't have it yet.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.287
Just like right now.

19:24.705 --> 19:29.585
And that is when you are at your best.
So, don't lose your focus.

19:30.294 --> 19:34.215
You're not in that capsule yet.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.494
<i>Regarding the traffic in Cocoa Beach,</i>

19:45.569 --> 19:48.114
<i>which is already backed up
as far as Merritt Island,</i>

19:48.187 --> 19:51.232
<i>and the sheriff's department
expects it to get worse tomorrow.</i>

19:51.440 --> 19:53.693
<i>Crowds are already
lining up for the launch,</i>

19:53.818 --> 19:55.111
<i>which is expected to...</i>

20:09.625 --> 20:10.960
<i>Now, why'd your folks decide</i>

20:11.127 --> 20:12.128
<i>to drive you all that way, Michael?</i>

20:12.211 --> 20:13.413
<i>Because I had a dream.</i>

20:13.646 --> 20:14.963
<i>What happened in this dream?</i>

20:15.214 --> 20:16.757
<i>Jesus Christ came back to earth.</i>

20:16.882 --> 20:19.051
<i>He was flying in a space capsule...</i>

20:19.135 --> 20:20.778
<i>That is a remarkable dream, Michael.</i>

20:20.828 --> 20:25.057
<i>Thank you. And that was Michael
from Duluth, Minnesota, waiting for his...</i>

20:27.393 --> 20:31.063
A little gift in anticipation
of your great success.

20:31.335 --> 20:33.482
Courtesy
of the Florida Growers Association.

20:33.858 --> 20:35.025
Thank you. Oh.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.071
Our hopes will be with you, Mr. Gilruth.
You know, all of us.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.450
- The entire free world.
- That's very nice of you.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.884
Yeah. Got it.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.933
- We've got storms up and down the coast.
- How far?

21:08.309 --> 21:11.103
We've got one off the coast
of Myrtle Beach, about 400 miles.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.133
- What do you think?
- I think it's Florida.

21:15.733 --> 21:17.193
No one can predict the damn weather.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.946
We go tomorrow on schedule.

21:24.029 --> 21:25.338
<i>At Cape Canaveral,</i>

21:25.409 --> 21:27.828
<i>the countdown began early this morning.</i>

21:28.788 --> 21:31.874
<i>Even if this experiment
is a spectacular success,</i>

21:32.124 --> 21:35.586
<i>it will still leave the United States
second to Russia.</i>

21:36.045 --> 21:39.799
<i>And if it's a catastrophic failure,
there will be deep gloom</i>

21:40.007 --> 21:43.677
<i>compounded by the tragic loss,
perhaps, of human life.</i>

21:44.303 --> 21:47.890
<i>We're told by President Kennedy and others
who have all the facts,</i>

21:48.307 --> 21:49.892
<i>that we may well fail...</i>

21:50.017 --> 21:52.770
- Oh. Hi, Rene.
- Louise.

21:54.467 --> 21:56.899
You know Scott worked
hard to get that job as CAPCOM.

21:57.569 --> 22:00.486
If NASA wanted to make a change,
that would be one thing,

22:00.569 --> 22:02.988
but this was just Al
throwing his weight around.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.910
Well, NASA isn't the one
going up in that rocket, Al is.

22:08.273 --> 22:10.736
He doesn't miss a chance
to lord it over everyone.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.959
But no one from NASA tried
to stand in his way.

22:15.042 --> 22:18.295
- Why do you think that is?
- Because they know Al's a prima donna.

22:21.215 --> 22:22.424
Scott wasn't ready.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.845
Maybe he left that out
when he told you what happened.

22:26.262 --> 22:29.306
The truth is,
he's never been ready for any of this.

22:33.394 --> 22:34.395
Look at you.

22:35.419 --> 22:37.986
You think you're so much better
than the rest of us.

22:38.061 --> 22:40.651
But my husband, he's a good man.

22:41.443 --> 22:44.446
He wasn't the one that got caught
with some tart in Tijuana.

22:49.608 --> 22:50.911
There were photos, Louise.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.957
And they would have been splashed
all over the newspapers

22:55.124 --> 22:57.543
if John Glenn hadn't stepped in
and cleaned up his mess.

22:57.626 --> 23:00.671
Al had to go crawling to him, begging.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.721
So, my guess is, my husband's
not the only one leaving things out.

23:16.020 --> 23:20.024
You'll have to excuse me.
I need to help my husband pack.

23:20.149 --> 23:21.442
He's going to space tomorrow.

23:48.145 --> 23:49.214
You proud of me, Lou?

23:54.058 --> 23:55.059
You know I am.

24:34.682 --> 24:35.683
Don't worry.

24:37.434 --> 24:38.435
He'll be fine...

24:42.022 --> 24:43.357
unless John kills him.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.658
<i>Tomorrow morning, the first American</i>

24:52.741 --> 24:56.912
<i>will be launched into space, and the world

24:57.194 --> 24:59.540
<i>The potential astronauts

24:59.623 --> 25:01.542
<i>to prevent a leak to the press.</i>

25:02.167 --> 25:04.420
<i>Will this end in America's finest hour...</i>

25:05.504 --> 25:06.922
<i>or tragedy?</i>

25:11.552 --> 25:14.555
"Rescue units on the scene
report that Astronaut Alan B. Shepard"

25:14.680 --> 25:16.890
"has perished today in the service
of his country."

25:17.433 --> 25:19.935
"Like Christopher Columbus
and the men with whom he sailed."

25:20.102 --> 25:24.398
"Astronaut Shepard undertook his mission
knowing full well he might not return."

25:24.773 --> 25:28.027
"His sacrifice will live on
as an example to his fellow Americans"

25:28.110 --> 25:29.903
"and free people the world over."

25:31.321 --> 25:32.322
Hmm.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.659
How about "heroic sacrifice"?

25:36.326 --> 25:38.245
Cute. But I'm not <i>LIFE Magazine.</i>

25:38.479 --> 25:40.622
This is strictly protocol,
so just give me a yes or no.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.210
"Like Christopher Columbus."

25:47.659 --> 25:49.173
It's got a pretty nice ring to it.

25:50.517 --> 25:51.550
It does.

26:30.631 --> 26:34.176
Tough life, huh?
Filet mignon for breakfast.

26:37.846 --> 26:38.847
This is a big deal.

26:40.516 --> 26:41.600
A day like today...

26:43.435 --> 26:45.646
a man's gotta think
about what's he's gonna say, you know?

26:46.438 --> 26:49.525
You gotta have somethin' good,
somethin'... memorable.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.372
There he is. How'd you sleep?

27:03.463 --> 27:04.498
Like a baby.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.251
Excellent.
That's what I like to hear.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.372
This is just routine, Al.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.506
Unless we find anything abnormal,
your launch will go as planned.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.600
<i>Do you consider yourself a hero?</i>

27:24.393 --> 27:29.189
No, I'm just a man
who's ready to fly his mission, Doc.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.150
And your wife?

27:31.680 --> 27:34.153
She'll be watching today.
Are you worried for her?

27:36.321 --> 27:38.657
Sixteen years as a test pilot's wife...

27:39.575 --> 27:41.076
Louise can handle just about anything.

27:57.426 --> 27:58.594
Good.

28:00.220 --> 28:01.680
<i> Any intrusive thoughts?</i>

28:06.268 --> 28:10.147
No, sir. Just a desire to leave
this planet as quickly as possible

28:10.772 --> 28:11.773
and come right back.

28:26.175 --> 28:28.707
<i>Every inch of the world
has been picked over.</i>

28:32.127 --> 28:35.214
This is my chance to be the first
at something memorable.

28:37.174 --> 28:38.717
<i>And I want it more than anyone, Annie.</i>

28:45.515 --> 28:48.310
Shepard passed his physical.
You're done for now, John.

29:33.438 --> 29:34.439
Well...

29:35.482 --> 29:36.858
beautiful night to launch a rocket.

29:41.780 --> 29:42.781
Cheers.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.040
- Got it?
- Yeah. I got it.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.173
Feels about right.

30:00.202 --> 30:02.676
Yep.

30:06.513 --> 30:09.349
- How do they sound in Bermuda?
- Testing now.

30:09.766 --> 30:11.810
Sequencing A1 recorders to minute speed.

30:13.937 --> 30:17.274
- Minute speed confirmed.
- Flight copies. TC, this is flight.

30:17.681 --> 30:19.234
Standing by for your next item.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.777
- Tube.
- Tube.

30:22.738 --> 30:24.323
Better?

30:25.032 --> 30:26.158
Yeah.

30:33.457 --> 30:34.458
Good.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.938
It just keeps comin', doesn't it?

30:58.690 --> 31:01.276
What idiot decided
to put this outfit in Florida?

31:04.112 --> 31:07.491
We have two more storm fronts
making their way along our coast.

31:08.241 --> 31:09.451
- But, Bob?
- Hmm.

31:11.917 --> 31:15.290
We got a real solid shot
at 30 good minutes right in between 'em.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.459
0800.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.777
You know the problem with oranges?

31:46.321 --> 31:48.240
They're delicate.

31:49.491 --> 31:51.243
One frost kills the whole crop.

31:53.453 --> 31:56.665
Scrub this flight.
We go again in two days.

31:56.748 --> 32:01.378
But, Chris, if we get this wrong,
the program is finished for good.

32:03.861 --> 32:06.177
You know the problem
with playing it safe, Bob?

32:08.733 --> 32:10.095
You never know if you got it right.

32:13.710 --> 32:15.100
<i>No, I'm not gonna be one of the seven.</i>

32:16.184 --> 32:19.187
- No?
- I'm gonna be the first man in space.

32:20.147 --> 32:21.484
Okay.

32:21.815 --> 32:24.568
To the space program.

32:24.869 --> 32:26.111
Time to go.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.947
- Here we go, boys.
- Break a leg.

32:33.567 --> 32:36.079
The Russians are flying clear to the moon.
You guys can't even get

32:36.163 --> 32:37.539
a rocket off the ground.

32:38.123 --> 32:40.000
And for this,
you gave up your Navy career.

32:45.255 --> 32:49.301
<i>Three, two, one, zero.</i>

32:56.349 --> 32:57.350
Bad news, Al.

33:21.063 --> 33:22.777
I can't believe they scrubbed the launch.

33:22.877 --> 33:24.442
I think they scrubbed the whole thing.

33:24.792 --> 33:26.844
- Look, boys, the door's open.
- The door's open!

33:27.923 --> 33:30.062
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

33:30.162 --> 33:31.792
Come on! Come on, let's go!

33:39.849 --> 33:41.874
- There he is!
- This way. Guys, come on!

33:43.438 --> 33:45.649
- Quick, he's over here.
- He went this way. Come on.

33:56.117 --> 33:57.118
John?

34:00.330 --> 34:03.959
- Hey. You're not supposed to be back here.
- Secret's out.

34:04.545 --> 34:06.847
Some of the boys spotted Al
in his flight gear.

34:10.479 --> 34:12.092
Sorry I didn't tell you, Loudon.

34:14.511 --> 34:16.471
Brass wanted me to keep it hush-hush.

34:17.415 --> 34:18.598
Well, I'm sorry, John.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.478
It really should have been you.

34:26.731 --> 34:27.816
Yeah. Well...

34:30.868 --> 34:32.737
I hope you didn't lose
too much money on me.

34:49.921 --> 34:55.802
<i>Some people say a man is made out of mud.</i>

34:56.136 --> 34:59.514
<i>A poor man's made outta muscle and blood.</i>

35:00.056 --> 35:03.560
<i>- Muscle and blood and skin and bone.
- Muscle and blood and skin and bone.</i>

35:03.852 --> 35:05.437
<i>- A mind that's weak.
- A mind that's weak.</i>

35:05.520 --> 35:07.063
<i>- And a back that's strong.
- And a back that's strong.</i>

35:07.147 --> 35:09.399
<i>- You load sixteen tons.
- You load sixteen tons.</i>

35:09.482 --> 35:11.192
<i>- And what do you get.
- And what do you get.</i>

35:11.260 --> 35:13.987
<i>- Another day older and deeper in debt.
- Another day older and deeper in debt.</i>

35:14.362 --> 35:16.197
<i>- Saint Peter don't you call me.
- Saint Peter don't you call me</i>

35:16.281 --> 35:17.991
<i>- 'Cause I can't go.
- 'Cause I can't go</i>

35:18.206 --> 35:22.047
<i>- I owe my soul to the company store.
- I owe my soul to the company store</i>

35:28.668 --> 35:29.878
Excuse us.

35:30.045 --> 35:32.380
Mrs. Shepard.

35:44.476 --> 35:45.477
I'm...

35:46.269 --> 35:47.437
I'm so sorry, Alan.

35:49.230 --> 35:52.233
If they could've just
held their nerve...

35:53.693 --> 35:55.362
...I'd be out in Grand Bahama right now.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.324
It's gonna take two full days...

35:59.407 --> 36:00.700
...to recycle the fuel.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.911
There's not a cloud in the sky.

36:03.078 --> 36:05.872
And they're keeping me restricted to base
now that everyone knows I'm the guy.

36:07.332 --> 36:11.086
I have a flight back to Virginia today.

36:13.296 --> 36:14.673
Did you hear what I just said?

36:15.423 --> 36:16.424
Can't leave.

36:17.394 --> 36:19.219
The press caught me. My name is out.

36:20.198 --> 36:21.638
I mean, how would it look
if you weren't here?

36:23.515 --> 36:25.600
Now you're worried
about how things would look?

36:31.147 --> 36:35.735
I don't ever wanna hear
about your indiscretions from anyone.

36:38.655 --> 36:39.656
Do you understand?

36:42.992 --> 36:45.620
Weezy...

36:47.163 --> 36:49.416
Lou, come on.

36:49.624 --> 36:50.667
- Just...
- No.

36:53.169 --> 36:55.922
I mean, there were photos, Alan?

36:59.146 --> 37:02.439
Is it true
that they would have been in the papers

37:02.929 --> 37:04.764
if John hadn't fixed it?

37:06.349 --> 37:07.517
Oh, my God.

37:10.979 --> 37:13.189
What if our girls had seen that?

37:21.781 --> 37:24.367
I love you, Alan.

37:25.193 --> 37:26.995
I'm not gonna go through this again.

37:29.289 --> 37:33.209
I can't just sit back and... smile,

37:33.418 --> 37:35.670
and pretend
to be your perfect little wife.

37:38.965 --> 37:40.091
I'm going back home.

38:14.819 --> 38:16.127
I know it's a drag, Al.

38:17.504 --> 38:18.588
I'd be mad, too.

38:24.147 --> 38:25.487
- Where are you going?
- Out.

38:27.673 --> 38:28.682
We're supposed to lay low.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.856
- I need some air.
- We're supposed to stay together.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.819
I don't like it any more than you do,
but those are our marching orders.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.487
Al, I am your backup.

38:45.240 --> 38:47.659
There's a thousand reporters out there.
Where would we even go?

39:03.854 --> 39:05.677
Well, it's peaceful up here.
I'll give you that.

39:10.936 --> 39:13.161
You know, when I was a kid,
we had a grain elevator

39:13.265 --> 39:14.978
next to the tracks in our town.

39:16.437 --> 39:19.023
It was the tallest thing around for miles,
and I used to, uh...

39:19.941 --> 39:22.161
I used to go up there sometimes
when I needed to think.

39:23.336 --> 39:24.612
You know, everything looked so...

39:26.258 --> 39:28.074
orderly from that height, you know?

39:28.825 --> 39:29.826
It all made sense.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.831
And whenever I'm feeling put out...

39:36.666 --> 39:37.959
I just have to remember that...

39:39.794 --> 39:40.920
it's just God's plan.

39:42.922 --> 39:43.923
All of it.

39:46.033 --> 39:47.969
You just weren't meant to go up today,
that's all.

39:52.323 --> 39:54.392
What do you think, John?
You think it was God's plan

39:54.475 --> 39:55.657
for you to send those letters?

40:03.318 --> 40:04.777
You know, you're a great pilot, Al.

40:07.484 --> 40:09.829
But I didn't write a thing
in those letters that isn't true.

40:13.036 --> 40:14.537
You're not the right man for this job.

40:16.331 --> 40:18.124
And you wouldn't even be wearing
that spacesuit

40:18.207 --> 40:20.444
if I hadn't saved your bacon in San Diego.

40:21.609 --> 40:23.546
Yeah, but that wasn't enough for you,
was it, John?

40:24.464 --> 40:25.465
To help me.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.509
No, you had to make sure
everyone knew about it.

40:28.826 --> 40:31.051
That is exactly why
no one likes you, John.

40:31.377 --> 40:34.724
You're a miserable, sanctimonious ass,
and it came back to bite you.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.602
That's why I'm going up and you're not.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.732
You really think anybody likes you, Al?

40:46.736 --> 40:48.529
I mean, sure, you won that vote, but...

40:49.989 --> 40:51.491
it had nothing to do with affection.

40:54.577 --> 40:58.206
People may not like me, John...
but they do wanna be me.

40:59.720 --> 41:00.820
I don't wanna be you.

41:03.436 --> 41:05.054
You can't even admit it to yourself.

41:05.797 --> 41:06.798
But I know.

41:07.715 --> 41:08.716
You wanna hurt me.

41:09.842 --> 41:11.636
You want something bad to happen to me.

41:14.826 --> 41:17.824
And I bet you'd love it if I just stepped
on over the edge there, wouldn't you?

41:18.351 --> 41:21.104
Took a little swan dive onto the cement?
Of course, you would.

41:21.567 --> 41:22.647
'Cause then you'd be first,

41:22.730 --> 41:24.482
and that's all that really matters
to you, John,

41:24.559 --> 41:26.693
no matter how much you praise the flag
or you thump the Bible...

41:26.776 --> 41:28.111
- You're wrong.
- Am I?

41:29.904 --> 41:32.949
This right here
is the difference between you and me.

41:33.032 --> 41:35.368
I say what I want, and I do it.

41:35.458 --> 41:37.708
But you, John,
you sneak around people's backs

41:37.808 --> 41:39.163
like a lying snake.

41:39.455 --> 41:40.581
- Al.
- Have you got what it takes

41:40.665 --> 41:41.916
- to stand on the edge?
- Al, step back.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.626
To be the goddamn hero
that you keep talking about?

41:43.710 --> 41:45.169
- Al, get away from...
- Hey!

41:48.047 --> 41:49.048
Have some guts.

41:49.882 --> 41:51.050
Admit what you want.

42:01.535 --> 42:03.938
I can find love for you in my heart, Al.

42:09.191 --> 42:10.319
I want you to know that.
