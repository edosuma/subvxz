00:02.156 --> 00:04.796
This programme contains strong
language and adult humour.

00:04.796 --> 00:06.956
Sir, your wife is very drunk.
We've had to remove her

00:06.956 --> 00:09.956
from our establishment, so now
she's on the streets, like rubbish.

00:09.956 --> 00:12.236
Jesus! Fucking open your eyes!
HORN BLARES

00:12.236 --> 00:14.036
Oh, my God!

00:14.036 --> 00:16.316
TYRES SQUEAL
Oh, my God, Rob!

00:16.316 --> 00:19.796
They're gonna give me a breathalyser.
          What... What?

00:19.796 --> 00:22.076
I'm not gonna pass it.

00:22.076 --> 00:23.396
What?

00:23.396 --> 00:26.996
HE SOBS
I'm sorry!

00:26.996 --> 00:28.676
SIREN WAILS

00:28.676 --> 00:32.460
Your offence showed brazen disregard
    for the safety of others.

00:32.460 --> 00:36.140
While you claim custody
would be distressing for you,

00:36.140 --> 00:39.836
incarceration
is the only appropriate response.

00:39.836 --> 00:43.500
Your sentence is one of
six months' imprisonment.

00:43.500 --> 00:47.396
You may go down.
MURMUR OF CONVERSATION

00:47.396 --> 00:50.756
Judge Hickey will preside
in the case of Robert Norris...

00:50.756 --> 00:53.876
You're up. Go on!

00:53.876 --> 00:57.260
..the Road Traffic Act 1991.

00:57.260 --> 00:59.820
Zip your fly.
What?Your fly's undone.

00:59.820 --> 01:02.756
OK.Zip your fly.
No, it's no problem.

01:02.756 --> 01:06.860
Following Mr Norris's arrest,
blood was taken,

01:06.860 --> 01:09.476
and he was found to be
40 milligrams over the limit,

01:09.476 --> 01:12.356
the limit being 80.
Mr Norris?

01:12.356 --> 01:16.620
Judge Hickey.
Call me "sir". We're not in Kansas.

01:16.620 --> 01:20.036
Sir Hickey, when I was six years old,

01:20.036 --> 01:23.756
I watched my father -We don't have
time for your autobiography.

01:23.756 --> 01:26.156
Right. May I approach the bench?

01:26.156 --> 01:28.556
I don't see a bench.

01:28.556 --> 01:34.436
OK. I accept full responsibility
for my misdemeanour...

01:34.436 --> 01:40.196
crime. Er, but this incident was
entirely out of character for me.

01:40.196 --> 01:44.516
I was in a very difficult place
emotionally, Your Honour, sir,

01:44.516 --> 01:50.276
as it had not been long
since I found out that, er,

01:50.276 --> 01:52.620
my wife had...

01:52.620 --> 01:57.116
masturbated off a young student,
a college boy,

01:57.116 --> 02:04.196
on the roof of a nightclub.

02:04.196 --> 02:08.036
I'm sorry. I just thought if I could
deflect some of the stink onto you -

02:08.036 --> 02:10.436
300 years ago,
if you'd have pulled that crap,

02:10.436 --> 02:13.556
I'm the one who would've been sent
down, with a scarlet letter on me.

02:13.556 --> 02:16.140
300 years ago
you were SUPPOSED to drive drunk.

02:16.140 --> 02:20.636
What, and you're Muireann?
You're Muireann.

02:20.636 --> 02:24.140
Do you wanna drive?
Oh, shit, sorry. Forgot.

02:24.140 --> 02:28.316
Not allowed to, because you're
a drunk driver and a fugitive.

02:28.316 --> 02:30.956
I'm not a fugitive.
I turned myself in!

02:30.956 --> 02:34.076
SHE LAUGHS
You didn't turn yourself in!

02:34.076 --> 02:36.620
If you could've run away from
the scene of the accident,

02:36.620 --> 02:38.876
I'm a hundred percent confident
you would've.

02:38.876 --> 02:42.716
You wish you were a fugitive. You
were arrested, so you're a criminal.

02:42.716 --> 02:49.916
A criminal in a neck brace.
What a fucking catch!

02:49.916 --> 02:53.516
I mean, I feel like I'm under
surveillance with Sharon now.

02:53.516 --> 02:55.556
It's, like,
I never had much privacy before,

02:55.556 --> 02:58.676
but now it's, like, Stasi level.
What's Stasi?

02:58.676 --> 03:01.436
East German secret police.
Well, at least she gives a shit.

03:01.436 --> 03:04.076
Most women would've flown the coop
after that stunt.

03:04.076 --> 03:06.716
That's true.
But it's still...menacing.

03:06.716 --> 03:09.476
And you haven't drunk since?
No.Why not?

03:09.476 --> 03:12.716
What's changed, other than
that pussy magnet round your neck?

03:12.716 --> 03:14.636
Honestly,
the only thing that's changed

03:14.636 --> 03:17.276
is that I now know that
my drinking could kill someone

03:17.276 --> 03:20.396
other than myself.
I mean, I didn't care if I got hurt,

03:20.396 --> 03:23.820
but I don't wanna kill
any civilian bystanders or my kids.

03:23.820 --> 03:25.796
You might not have cared
if you'd got hurt,

03:25.796 --> 03:28.556
but did you think about how lonely
I'd have been without you,

03:28.556 --> 03:31.676
you fat cunt?Can we talk about
anything other than me?

03:31.676 --> 03:34.700
With pleasure. Let's talk about me.
How's your new girlfriend?

03:34.700 --> 03:37.316
Oh, I dunno, mate.
It's moving at warp speed over here.

03:37.316 --> 03:40.196
She wants to move in. Got us
a family membership at the gym,

03:40.196 --> 03:42.596
which was, like,
"Whoa, there, Nelly!"

03:42.596 --> 03:45.476
What's her name?
Nelly.Really?

03:45.476 --> 03:47.876
No, it's Tanya.
Hey, do you wanna meet her?

03:47.876 --> 03:50.276
What you doing this weekend?
I have community service

03:50.276 --> 03:54.116
for the next 215 weekends,
in a fucking charity shop.

03:54.116 --> 03:56.460
Christ. It's humiliating.

03:56.460 --> 03:59.660
It's probably less humiliating than
having to ask a judge's permission

03:59.660 --> 04:03.020
to go to your wife's funeral because
you backed over her in the driveway.

04:03.020 --> 04:11.180
Yeah.OK. Have a great weekend.

04:11.180 --> 04:20.036
HORN BLARES

04:20.036 --> 04:22.380
How'd you even know I was here?
You told me.

04:22.380 --> 04:27.020
It was in your calendar.
I forget. Who cares?

04:27.020 --> 04:30.236
Honey, I'm on probation
from the state,

04:30.236 --> 04:32.876
and they're doing a pretty good job.

04:32.876 --> 04:35.660
I'm accounted for.
You need to stop following me.

04:35.660 --> 04:38.540
Don't say it like that, like
I'm obsessed with you or something.

04:38.540 --> 04:43.916
This isn't Fatal Attraction. There's
25 pubs between here and our house

04:43.916 --> 04:47.036
that I can't trust you to walk past
because you're a secret alcoholic.

04:47.036 --> 04:50.540
I'm not a secret alcoholic.
I told you that the night we met.

04:50.540 --> 04:55.196
OK, then. A lying alcoholic. This is
inconvenient for me too, you know.

04:55.196 --> 04:57.740
Seriously, why are there
so many pubs around here?

04:57.740 --> 05:00.836
Don't they have zoning laws?
It's, like, pub, JD Sports,

05:00.836 --> 05:05.756
pub, bike shop, pub,
William Hill, pub, Pret, pub,

05:05.756 --> 05:12.356
Pret, Pret, pub, Pret...

05:12.356 --> 05:18.116
So, how did you guys get into the
whole cerebral-palsy charity scene?

05:18.116 --> 05:21.116
My daughter has cerebral palsy.
Oh! Oh, great.

05:21.116 --> 05:27.020
Er, I mean, it makes sense that -
I have cerebral palsy.

05:27.020 --> 05:30.356
Hey, have guys ever seen
Last Comic Standing?

05:30.356 --> 05:34.556
Do you guys watch that show?
A cerebral-palsy guy did that,

05:34.556 --> 05:38.540
and he won the whole thing,
because, as you know,

05:38.540 --> 05:41.396
people with cerebral palsy
can do anything.

05:41.396 --> 05:43.436
I can't drive.

05:43.436 --> 05:49.916
Well...neither can I!

05:49.916 --> 05:53.156
BACKGROUND CHATTER

05:53.156 --> 05:54.540
Yeah!

05:54.540 --> 05:56.516
SHE SIGHS

05:56.516 --> 06:01.796
Any chance I can put
my appropriate-weight son on there?

06:01.796 --> 06:03.836
Fuck's sake.

06:03.836 --> 06:07.020
Play on the slide instead.
Go on there.

06:07.020 --> 06:14.876
SHE SIGHS

06:14.876 --> 06:20.156
PHONE RINGS

06:20.156 --> 06:24.620
Hello! Cerebral palsy...busters.

06:24.620 --> 06:27.356
Do you wanna take us for lunch?
I need a drink.

06:27.356 --> 06:31.500
I dunno if I can.
They run kind of a tight ship here.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.356
Nothing happens in charity shops.

06:33.356 --> 06:36.716
Just ask them if you can pop to
Greggs for a fucking sausage roll.

06:36.716 --> 06:39.500
I had Greggs for breakfast.
What? You had breakfast at home.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.380
Yeah, but then I passed one, so -
"Just ask them!"

06:42.380 --> 06:46.196
OK! Jesus. Hang on.

06:46.196 --> 06:50.220
Sorry. Um, excuse me. Hi.
Um, that's my wife on the phone,

06:50.220 --> 06:52.676
and she's wondering
when my lunch hour is,

06:52.676 --> 06:56.396
cos she's on her own with the kids.
Oh, we don't take a lunch break.

06:56.396 --> 07:02.276
We just bring sandwiches in,
in case there's a lunchtime rush.

07:02.276 --> 07:05.636
OK.

07:05.636 --> 07:07.676
Yeah. It's not happening.

07:07.676 --> 07:10.916
Listen, why don't you take the kids
somewhere nice for lunch -

07:10.916 --> 07:13.796
you know, treat yourself?
Yeah! OK.

07:13.796 --> 07:15.980
Because, as we both know,
lunch somewhere nice

07:15.980 --> 07:18.356
with two loud, dirty children
under the age of four

07:18.356 --> 07:20.396
is a real fucking treat.
See you at home.

07:20.396 --> 07:23.180
I have my AA meeting tonight.
Again?!

07:23.180 --> 07:26.396
Well, I mean, you don't really
graduate from alcoholism.

07:26.396 --> 07:29.900
So I'm supposed to watch Game Of
Thrones on my own, like a pervert?

07:29.900 --> 07:33.356
Well, I...Fine. If anything
designer gets donated by mistake,

07:33.356 --> 07:41.756
put it aside for me, OK? Bye.

07:41.756 --> 07:45.116
Have you thought about a bit
of therapy?We've thought about it,

07:45.116 --> 07:48.356
but we don't really wanna hear
our terrible problems out loud.

07:48.356 --> 07:51.020
Chris always likened therapy
to taking a shit.

07:51.020 --> 07:54.236
Better to do it in the therapist's
office than stink up your own home.

07:54.236 --> 07:56.516
I can only shit at home.

07:56.516 --> 07:59.340
Well, whatever works for you.

07:59.340 --> 08:02.276
Can't be easy
being married to a criminal.

08:02.276 --> 08:05.276
Where's Jeffrey today?
He's moved out,

08:05.276 --> 08:08.780
and moved in with Chris. Turned down
  a role in a Vin Diesel movie

08:08.780 --> 08:11.636
to do Twelfth Night at the theatre.
God, that's rough.

08:11.636 --> 08:14.876
I'm sorry to hear that.
We fell out.

08:14.876 --> 08:20.036
But I'm quite happy on my own
in my bachelorette pad.

08:20.036 --> 08:23.036
I haven't put a bra on
before 4pm all week.

08:23.036 --> 08:45.260
SHE CHUCKLES

08:45.260 --> 08:47.996
Hello!

08:47.996 --> 08:50.276
Rob, right?
Hi.

08:50.276 --> 08:53.156
Thank you for...
Oh, finish your biscuit.

08:53.156 --> 08:56.516
HE GRUNTS
Just, er, wanted to say that...

08:56.516 --> 08:59.180
I realised, what you were sharing
about your accident,

08:59.180 --> 09:02.060
that I was there!
On Redchurch Street.

09:02.060 --> 09:04.316
I was actually there that night.
You were there?

09:04.316 --> 09:06.716
Yeah! I'm so relieved you're OK.

09:06.716 --> 09:09.900
I'm...not telling you this
to make you feel bad,

09:09.900 --> 09:12.836
but, um, I had to go to the hospital
         too that night.

09:12.836 --> 09:16.620
I got...some of your windscreen
in my leg.

09:16.620 --> 09:19.340
Some glass splintered and cut me,
if you can believe it.

09:19.340 --> 09:22.916
I had no idea anyone el-...
I'm so sorry!

09:22.916 --> 09:26.276
Don't worry about it! I'm just glad
you found your way here.

09:26.276 --> 09:29.420
A lot of people don't.
For me, it was losing my husband.

09:29.420 --> 09:31.980
He died five years ago next week.

09:31.980 --> 09:34.076
I was blacked out as usual.

09:34.076 --> 09:36.356
They think I probably knocked over
a candle.

09:36.356 --> 09:39.596
They got me out, the firemen,
but they didn't reach him in time.

09:39.596 --> 09:42.956
Oh, God! Jesus, I'm sorry.

09:42.956 --> 09:45.116
Oh, thank you, love.

09:45.116 --> 09:47.180
Oh, yeah! And you said in your share

09:47.180 --> 09:49.796
that you've been listening to
a lot of Radiohead.

09:49.796 --> 09:52.316
SHE TUTS
Try to get better, OK,

09:52.316 --> 10:06.380
not wank off to your little
man-feelings. See you next week.

10:06.380 --> 10:08.780
Jesus!

10:08.780 --> 10:12.300
So, was he, like, cooked,
or was it smoke inhalation?

10:12.300 --> 10:14.700
I dunno. I'll ask her next time.

10:14.700 --> 10:17.276
So, what age is she?
What's she look like?

10:17.276 --> 10:20.300
Er, 35, 60.

10:20.300 --> 10:22.556
She looks sorta mousy.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.356
Mouse-like?

10:24.356 --> 10:27.116
She looked like
she was transforming into a mouse,

10:27.116 --> 10:29.276
and then got interrupted mid-spell.

10:29.276 --> 10:32.396
Wow! So, you've been thinking
about her a lot?

10:32.396 --> 10:35.036
Well, it's just...
I feel responsible.

10:35.036 --> 10:37.196
There's probably
a statute of limitations anyway.

10:37.196 --> 10:39.836
It's not a rape.
She just cut her leg.

10:39.836 --> 10:43.500
If she was hurt, then, of course
we should help her in some way.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.220
All I'm saying is,
was she really hurt?

10:46.220 --> 10:49.316
She had to go to the hospital.
Had to? Come on.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.940
And also, you know, you go out 11:30
 on a Saturday night in London,

10:52.940 --> 10:55.436
you might get some glass
in your leg,

10:55.436 --> 11:00.356
so whose fault is it really?

11:00.356 --> 11:06.116
I think we've seen it all now, yeah?
 Let's go and get some nosh n...

11:06.116 --> 11:08.876
What?
Can I have this?

11:08.876 --> 11:16.436
Don't you have one of those?
No.Gimme a look.

11:16.436 --> 11:18.540
Oh, come on!

11:18.540 --> 11:21.356
Let's have a look in that bin!

11:21.356 --> 11:24.300
Look at those guys, huh?

11:24.300 --> 11:26.540
What about this little fella?

11:26.540 --> 11:28.676
I want Daddy.

11:28.676 --> 11:44.780
SHE SIGHS

11:44.780 --> 11:55.796
Gimme a look at it. What's that?

11:55.796 --> 11:57.836
Hello.
Can I get this?Yeah.

11:57.836 --> 12:19.504
Thank you.

12:19.504 --> 12:22.744
HE SIGHS

12:22.744 --> 12:25.984
Excuse me. We're gonna be closing
soon, and... Oh, hey!

12:25.984 --> 12:28.984
Amanda?I was just at physio
around the corner,

12:28.984 --> 12:31.168
and I remembered you saying
you were working here.

12:31.168 --> 12:34.624
Thought I'd drop in and say hi,
and get this.

12:34.624 --> 12:38.104
Oh, just so you know,
I inventoried that earlier,

12:38.104 --> 12:41.944
and somebody's replaced the bishops
with Monopoly hotels.

12:41.944 --> 12:46.024
I guess just remember, bishop,
hotel, and you should be fine.

12:46.024 --> 12:48.664
SHE LAUGHS

12:48.664 --> 12:52.504
A plastic bag...

12:52.504 --> 12:55.504
You look stressed.

12:55.504 --> 12:58.624
Um, it's just...
you know, I feel guilty

12:58.624 --> 13:01.624
that my wife is looking after
the kids, and I'm here,

13:01.624 --> 13:03.664
folding doilies.

13:03.664 --> 13:06.304
Well, look, think about it this way.

13:06.304 --> 13:10.504
At least you didn't burn your house
down while your husband was in it.

13:10.504 --> 13:12.544
Wow!
I'm joking.

13:12.544 --> 13:14.824
I mean, I'm not joking.
That happened.

13:14.824 --> 13:17.704
But I always think,
"What would God want me to do?"

13:17.704 --> 13:20.128
Flagellate myself in my basement
for the rest of my life,

13:20.128 --> 13:24.064
or come to places like this
and help people like you?

13:24.064 --> 13:27.304
You have to forgive yourself.
I forgive you!

13:27.304 --> 13:29.464
SHE CHUCKLES

13:29.464 --> 13:32.224
Oh, I...Are you OK?
I'm sorry. Yes.

13:32.224 --> 13:35.464
Just...a little dizzy.

13:35.464 --> 13:38.944
Skipped lunch earlier, and
between that and my leg, I, er...

13:38.944 --> 13:42.544
Could you...possibly...walk me home?

13:42.544 --> 13:44.704
It... It's really not far.
I...

13:44.704 --> 13:47.344
Could I call you a taxi instead?

13:47.344 --> 13:50.464
It's just I've been gone all day.
I really need to get home.

13:50.464 --> 13:54.424
No. It's OK. I... I get carsick.

13:54.424 --> 14:00.304
It... It is fine. I'll manage.

14:00.304 --> 14:21.544
Bishop, hotel.
SHE LAUGHS

14:21.544 --> 14:23.224
DOOR CLICKS

14:23.224 --> 14:25.744
What were you doing in Dalston?
What?

14:25.744 --> 14:28.864
Did you go drinking? Did you go
drinking under the bridge?

14:28.864 --> 14:32.824
No! The lady with the limp
asked me to walk her home.

14:32.824 --> 14:35.344
You walked
the glass-in-her-leg lady home?

14:35.344 --> 14:38.368
Well, I couldn't say no.
Oh, my God.Her leg was hurting.

14:38.368 --> 14:41.464
What do you want me to do?I want you
   to stop farting your guilt

14:41.464 --> 14:44.344
onto some lady - who's taking you
for a ride, by the way.

14:44.344 --> 14:47.344
I can feel it. Seriously,
you need to get some advice on this,

14:47.344 --> 14:50.464
because this is gonna end badly.
You need to talk to a lawyer.

14:50.464 --> 14:52.928
Get them to send
a cease-and-desist letter.

14:52.928 --> 14:56.464
Cease and desist from asking me
to walk her home?

14:56.464 --> 15:00.664
Do not get caught up in her shit,
Rob! Don't go there again!

15:00.664 --> 15:04.984
Fine!Seriously, why am I dragging
kids around fucking museums

15:04.984 --> 15:07.168
when you're working as an escort?

15:07.168 --> 15:11.488
Honestly, it'd be easier
if you just...lived in China

15:11.488 --> 15:14.224
than this shit.
Spend what little time you have,

15:14.224 --> 15:17.248
when you're not getting arrested
or having probation hearings

15:17.248 --> 15:19.624
with your family.
She's a fucking fire widow

15:19.624 --> 15:22.624
that I injured in a car accident
I'm trying to help out,

15:22.624 --> 15:26.048
and who has a shaving of sympathy
for what I'm going through.

15:26.048 --> 15:28.984
Oh, please!
How did you know I was in Dalston?

15:28.984 --> 15:31.744
Find my phone.
What?

15:31.744 --> 15:35.168
The app thing.
You need to stop surveilling me, OK?

15:35.168 --> 15:37.144
I'm not planning a bank robbery.

15:37.144 --> 15:40.624
I'm going to AA.
I'm working in a charity shop,

15:40.624 --> 15:44.344
plus my real job,
and I'm doing the best I can.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.528
And you're just...
I mean, it's, like...

15:46.528 --> 15:48.664
making a murderer up in here.

15:48.664 --> 15:50.848
You trying to DRIVE me back
to the bottle?

15:50.848 --> 15:52.984
Oh, my God!

15:52.984 --> 15:56.288
Now I've heard it all!
Does that make you feel good,

15:56.288 --> 15:58.864
blaming it on me?
It feels great!

15:58.864 --> 16:00.928
SHE SIGHS

16:00.928 --> 16:04.504
Those are for Frankie's lunch.
Really?

16:04.504 --> 16:08.704
Did HE pay for 'em?
HE SLURPS

16:08.704 --> 16:13.264
Or did I?

16:13.264 --> 16:17.944
Oh, my God!

16:17.944 --> 16:22.048
The receipt's in the bag.
Have a good day.

16:22.048 --> 16:30.544
Hi.How are you?
Yeah, just gonna grab those.

16:30.544 --> 16:34.264
Sorry. It's just...

16:34.264 --> 16:48.664
Um...just a minute.

16:48.664 --> 16:51.664
That isn't the right price tag
for this pair.

16:51.664 --> 16:54.208
Hm?
That's the wrong price tag.

16:54.208 --> 16:56.944
Is it?

16:56.944 --> 16:59.824
Did you swap the tag?
Why would I swap a tag?

16:59.824 --> 17:03.424
Because these cost £150 more.
Really?

17:03.424 --> 17:06.904
Well, that's...aggravating.
Do you still want them?

17:06.904 --> 17:10.144
Yes, I still want them.
That's why I'm buying them.

17:10.144 --> 17:12.664
But I'd be grateful
if you could find the right tag.

17:12.664 --> 17:17.824
You have the tag.

17:17.824 --> 17:22.048
What?

17:22.048 --> 17:24.128
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

17:24.128 --> 17:28.504
I can only think that my son
must have swapped the tags,

17:28.504 --> 17:32.608
because...
Your son picked out a waist-27 jean?

17:32.608 --> 17:35.344
You know what?
I don't know how this happened.

17:35.344 --> 17:39.064
I know how it happened.
But what's the big deal, really?

17:39.064 --> 17:42.304
Cos next month they're gonna be
in the sale for that price anyway.

17:42.304 --> 17:45.248
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you work here?
Because most of the time

17:45.248 --> 17:49.744
it's the fucking owners
who determine if there's a sale on.

17:49.744 --> 17:53.824
Was it worth it,
to get some cheaper jeans?

17:53.824 --> 17:56.128
They're probably gonna be too tight
on you anyway.

17:56.128 --> 17:59.704
Pardon?
You heard me.

17:59.704 --> 18:02.048
You know I could call the police.

18:02.048 --> 18:04.928
Do you think they're gonna put you
in some nice ladies' cell,

18:04.928 --> 18:09.088
because you're a nice lady?
There's no such thing.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.928
And do you know where they go,
if you get arrested?

18:12.928 --> 18:20.224
They don't go with you.

18:20.224 --> 18:23.944
Sir, my husband's an alcoholic.

18:23.944 --> 18:27.064
My children don't have a father...

18:27.064 --> 18:29.944
this weekend, and it's just...

18:29.944 --> 18:57.568
It's just really hard.
It's just really hard right now.

18:57.568 --> 19:14.224
PHONE PINGS

19:14.224 --> 19:16.288
HE RINGS DOORBELL

19:16.288 --> 19:20.768
Yeah?
Oh, er... Is Amanda...

19:20.768 --> 19:23.968
I've got, er...

19:23.968 --> 19:43.264
I'm sorry. Are you a friend of hers?
No. I'm her husband.

19:43.264 --> 19:48.784
PHONE BUZZES

19:48.784 --> 19:50.224
Hello?

19:50.224 --> 19:52.984
Hi. Oh. Is Rob there?

19:52.984 --> 19:57.904
No. He left his phone here,
and a large Burger King bag.

19:57.904 --> 19:59.824
Hold on.

19:59.824 --> 20:04.504
There's a orange Fanta in it,
and some socks.

20:04.504 --> 20:08.224
Where is he?I don't know.
He left about an hour ago.

20:08.224 --> 20:26.224
He left... OK. Thanks.

20:26.224 --> 20:35.224
I left the money for the...on the...

20:35.224 --> 20:37.624
Rob! Rob!

20:37.624 --> 20:39.008
Oh!

20:39.008 --> 20:40.624
Agh!

20:40.624 --> 20:41.944
Oh...

20:41.944 --> 20:43.984
Mummy?

PHONE RINGS
SHE GROANS

20:54.904 --> 20:58.024
"I'm so sorry. I had to pick up
my phone from the charity shop,

20:58.024 --> 21:02.104
and then by the time I - "

21:02.104 --> 21:09.784
OK! OK.

21:09.784 --> 21:11.704
Can I help you?

21:11.704 --> 21:13.984
Oh! Er, I was looking for Rob.

21:13.984 --> 21:18.304
Oh, he's not at home. He's -
May I come inside and wait for him?

21:18.304 --> 21:23.224
Erm...do you know what?
Let me get the pushchair inside.

21:23.224 --> 21:27.064
Er, you know what? Actually, um...

21:27.064 --> 21:30.424
Let me give him a call,
because I can tell him that -Hey!

21:30.424 --> 21:33.248
What the hell?!

21:33.248 --> 21:35.488
Did she hurt you?
What? No, I fell over.

21:35.488 --> 21:38.048
You cannot come here.
You cannot come to my home.

21:38.048 --> 21:40.144
Why are you angry?
I don't understand.

21:40.144 --> 21:43.384
I just met your husband, OK?
Your ALIVE husband.

21:43.384 --> 21:46.024
You might not get jail time
for burning somebody

21:46.024 --> 21:49.624
in a bullshit story,
but you should at least get a fine.

21:49.624 --> 21:52.384
I mean, are you even an alcoholic?
Is your name even Amanda?

21:52.384 --> 21:55.024
It's probably fuckin' Joan.

21:55.024 --> 21:59.704
You called it. My smart wife.
She fuckin' knew.

21:59.704 --> 22:02.584
Rob, maybe we could talk about this
somewhere in private.

22:02.584 --> 22:04.864
Never come near me
and my family again,

22:04.864 --> 22:07.864
unless you wanna take another trip
to the hospital.That's too much!

22:07.864 --> 22:10.864
Come on!
I'm sorry, OK?

22:10.864 --> 22:34.048
I didn't mean that.
I'm sorry. Have a...good evening.

22:34.048 --> 22:36.664
I'm sorry.
Yeah, you should be.

22:36.664 --> 22:41.344
Because that scared everyone -
me, limp lady, the kids...

22:41.344 --> 22:45.424
And the neighbours. Mike Walls just
called and asked if we were OK.

22:45.424 --> 22:48.304
What you tell him?I told him
to give me back my cordless drill.

22:48.304 --> 22:51.784
SHE LAUGHS

22:51.784 --> 22:54.064
Iamsorry.

22:54.064 --> 23:01.144
Can I ask you something?

23:01.144 --> 23:03.664
Were you unhappy the whole time?

23:03.664 --> 23:06.904
Like when we had that weekend in
Margate - were you unhappy there?

23:06.904 --> 23:10.144
What about when we went to Whipsnade
Zoo? Were you drinking in Whipsnade?

23:10.144 --> 23:12.664
No. Why would I -
But you weren't happy.

23:12.664 --> 23:15.544
You didn't love being a dad
and a husband enough

23:15.544 --> 23:18.208
to not drink vodka in the basement.

23:18.208 --> 23:20.824
Honey, those things can coexist.

23:20.824 --> 23:23.968
Did you ever drive with the kids
in the car when you were drinking?

23:23.968 --> 23:30.064
No. God, no. I would never -
Ah, so just with me, then.

23:30.064 --> 23:33.064
Honey, I need you
to try and trust me again,

23:33.064 --> 23:36.184
just so you don't worry or panic
when you don't know where I am,

23:36.184 --> 23:38.368
and feel like you have to track me.

23:38.368 --> 23:40.984
I'm not doing that
cos I don't trust you.

23:40.984 --> 23:43.504
Well, then, why are you?

23:43.504 --> 23:47.968
Because I get scared
when I can't see you.

23:47.968 --> 23:51.808
OK? I had to look at you
in the mangled wreck of a car.

23:51.808 --> 23:54.664
From the time it took me to run
from that shitty pizza place

23:54.664 --> 23:56.704
to the car, I thought you were dead.

23:56.704 --> 23:59.224
Oh, honey!

23:59.224 --> 24:02.368
Agh!

24:02.368 --> 24:05.104
Just don't die on me.

24:05.104 --> 24:07.504
The kids would be fucked
if you die first.

24:07.504 --> 24:12.064
Well, I mean, they'd be way more
fucked if you died first.

24:12.064 --> 24:17.584
Dunno about that. I don't feel like
much of a mother right now.

24:17.584 --> 24:22.384
I got caught stealing today
from a shop, with the kids,

24:22.384 --> 24:26.848
like a meth-head.
I nearly got arrested.

24:26.848 --> 24:32.128
Why are you laughing?Cos that's,
like, a garden-variety cry for help.

24:32.128 --> 24:35.344
Well, then, help me.
Answer my cry for help.

24:35.344 --> 24:40.024
What did you steal?A dinosaur pillow
      and a pair of jeans.

24:40.024 --> 24:44.768
Oh, well, then, it's just a matter of
time before the SWAT team gets here.

24:44.768 --> 24:50.224
SHE LAUGHS
Fuck off.

24:50.224 --> 24:52.984
Check out Bonnie and Clyde here.

24:52.984 --> 25:08.944
THEY LAUGH

25:08.944 --> 25:20.824

25:20.824 --> 25:27.064

SHE LAUGHS

25:33.568 --> 25:36.184
I'm so sorry!
I... It's the neck brace.

25:36.184 --> 25:38.584
Oh.
I... Sorry. I just...

25:38.584 --> 25:41.248
It's... Shall I turn around,
and then you can...

25:41.248 --> 25:45.424
Oh, sure.
Cos then I don't... Yeah.

25:45.424 --> 25:47.344
SHE GASPS

25:47.344 --> 25:51.064
Wait. No. Sorry. Sorry.
Now I can see you in the mirror.

25:51.064 --> 25:53.728
What...
Er, should I turn the light off?

25:53.728 --> 25:56.824
Yeah, that'd be great.
Sorry. Thanks so much.

25:56.824 --> 25:59.224

Ooh!
