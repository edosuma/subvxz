WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.605
You said Paige's stuff
was gone.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.607
- Help!
- E-Easy, now.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.276
Help!

00:09.343 --> 00:11.545
Oh. Oh, God.

00:11.645 --> 00:12.680
What have you done?

00:15.516 --> 00:17.885
When you hired us,
you failed to mention

00:17.985 --> 00:20.621
that there are $15 million
at stake.

00:20.721 --> 00:23.091
Who are all these other people
looking for them?

00:23.191 --> 00:24.425
What do you know
about Luke?

00:24.525 --> 00:26.427
I know he's in trouble.
And I'm guessing that

00:26.527 --> 00:27.861
you're part of that.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.130
You two kill Luke,

00:29.230 --> 00:31.065
and then we'll go have
a look-see for Paige.

00:31.165 --> 00:33.067
Killing Luke was never
part of the agreement.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.468
You look terrified.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.405
There are some bad people
on this trip.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.377
Hey, baby.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.314
Miss me?

00:47.315 --> 00:49.650
Paige.
You're okay.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.452
No thanks to you.

00:51.552 --> 00:52.886
What are you
talking about?

00:52.986 --> 00:53.921
You left me.

00:54.021 --> 00:55.456
That's not
how I remember it.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.658
I left to get help.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.460
Yeah, well,
they found us.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.795
All right, Mr. Jimmy sent
some freaks to the camp.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.765
He knows where we are
and he wants the money back.

01:04.865 --> 01:07.335
- Where's the journal?
- I-I thought you had it.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.602
You took it with you.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.971
If I had it,
would I be here?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.906
Look, Paige,
i-it doesn't matter, all right?

01:13.006 --> 01:14.308
The money's
not important anymore.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.244
Let's go
before it's too late.

01:16.344 --> 01:19.313
She ain't going nowhere
with you.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.115
- Who the hell are you?
- Me?

01:21.215 --> 01:24.285
I'm the guy who saved her.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.654
Paige, Paige, seriously,
let's get the hell out of here.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.322
It's true.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.990
He saved me.

01:30.090 --> 01:30.991
From you.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.428
You were gonna bash
her brains in with that rock.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.130
Yeah, that's right. I saw you.

01:36.230 --> 01:39.167
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.834
Now, where's her journal?

01:40.934 --> 01:45.173
Okay, just-- just listen
to me for a sec, okay?

01:49.810 --> 01:51.379
Are you just
gonna stand there?

01:51.479 --> 01:54.482
Oh, I'm just giving him
a head start.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.817
More sporting that way.

01:56.917 --> 02:00.388
I'll be back in two shakes
of a lamb's tail.

02:09.096 --> 02:14.668
Emily was the one that found
Mary's body off a trail.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.004
Did anybody search the area
where the body was found?

02:17.104 --> 02:20.241
Well, after Buck
brought Mary's body back,

02:20.341 --> 02:22.710
he and Avery went back up
to take a look around.

02:22.810 --> 02:23.911
Daddy?!

02:24.011 --> 02:26.847
Hey. Come here.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.583
I got you. I got you.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.519
You okay? Hmm?

02:33.354 --> 02:35.189
What happened?

02:35.289 --> 02:37.991
I followed Luke into the woods
and I got lost.

02:38.091 --> 02:40.394
And then I saw her.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.029
She was bleeding.

02:42.129 --> 02:45.333
I don't know.
She had Paige's bag.

02:45.433 --> 02:47.335
I just thought
that she was hurt,

02:47.435 --> 02:48.502
but then I saw her eyes.

02:48.602 --> 02:51.239
Okay. Baby.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.540
I got you.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.347
Tell me about Luke and Paige.

02:59.447 --> 03:02.015
Well, they were guests.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.252
Uh, Paige left early.
She went home.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.754
And then there was a little
something-something going on

03:06.854 --> 03:09.290
between Luke and Mary
after that.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.725
Luke said that he was leaving.

03:11.825 --> 03:14.362
He was really scared
about something.

03:14.462 --> 03:15.696
Emily's right.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.265
We can't find Luke.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.300
Excuse us. Come here.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.071
We're gonna need to gather
everybody and get statements.

03:24.171 --> 03:26.774
Okay. We'll let the staff know.

03:26.874 --> 03:27.808
Thank you.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.162
You're okay.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.298
Em.

03:50.398 --> 03:53.267
Hey. We're so glad you're here.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.737
Avery, Sunny said
that you went out looking

03:56.837 --> 03:58.105
after the body was found.

03:58.205 --> 03:59.673
What for?

03:59.773 --> 04:02.976
Yeah, uh, Buck wanted
to find Luke, so...

04:03.076 --> 04:04.978
You think Luke
could have done this?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.480
I don't know. I don't know.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.182
There's--
There's a lot to process.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.319
Rangers are setting up
a roadblock

04:11.419 --> 04:13.020
while we lock down
the crime scene.

04:17.825 --> 04:18.826
What the...

04:18.926 --> 04:21.362
What are you two doing here?

04:21.462 --> 04:23.497
Same thing
as everybody else.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.666
Vacation, outdoor vibes.

04:25.766 --> 04:26.700
Now ruined.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.969
- Really?
- I know, right?

04:29.069 --> 04:30.838
I mean, it's just our luck.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.541
All we wanted to do was shut off
for a couple of days,

04:33.641 --> 04:36.344
and now this-- a murder.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.346
God, it's awful.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.013
I'll be writing a review.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.215
0.0 stars.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.653
Where was Buck
when you found Mary?

04:45.753 --> 04:47.287
I actually don't know.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.689
He must have heard me scream.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.858
Before I knew it,
he was just there.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.693
Okay.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.362
Do you think Luke
could have killed her?

04:54.462 --> 04:55.696
No.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.565
Is that a feeling you have,
or is there something else?

04:58.832 --> 05:00.300
It's just a feeling, I guess.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.336
Okay. That's enough questions.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.472
I know you're just
doing your job.

05:04.572 --> 05:07.307
Come on, Em.
Let's get you some water.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.242
- Avery.
- Mm-hmm.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.745
You need to tell me
what the hell's going on here

05:11.845 --> 05:14.815
and why you let my
daughter wander off
into those woods alone.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.154
We had no idea.
All right?

05:21.254 --> 05:23.557
She didn't tell Carla, either.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.827
Can you give us a sec?

05:29.096 --> 05:32.099
Tonya and Donno are here.

05:32.199 --> 05:33.767
What?

05:33.867 --> 05:35.836
Yeah. They obviously had
something to do with this.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.240
Did they confess?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.775
If they didn't confess,
we got to treat them

05:41.875 --> 05:44.612
like everybody else--
possible suspects.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.217
You shouldn't have brought
Mary's body back here.

05:50.317 --> 05:51.519
What were you thinking?

05:51.619 --> 05:55.623
I had to do a little improvising
after Emily found her.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.558
Trust me, it's a good thing.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.226
How is that a good thing?

05:59.326 --> 06:02.696
Mary's DNA might still be on me
or mine on her.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.098
If that's the case,
we have an explanation for it.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.436
Smart.
I didn't think about that.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.471
Well, I really
didn't have a choice.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.074
I can't stop thinking
about that girl.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.443
No, don't do that.

06:15.543 --> 06:18.646
She did nothing wrong, Buck.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.814
Don't go there.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.082
It's done.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.817
I know it. I know it.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.787
We're in a lot of trouble
here, Buck.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.294
Listen.

06:34.394 --> 06:38.265
Luke's still out there,
all right?

06:38.365 --> 06:39.800
We're gonna use him.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.436
He killed Paige and then
he killed Mary to cover it up.

06:42.536 --> 06:45.473
It'll make sense to the cops.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.808
Cops like sense.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.643
Thank you.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.979
All right, uh, do we have
a timeline on Mary?

06:52.079 --> 06:54.448
Uh, went for a jog alone
around 3:00 p.m.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.316
No one saw her
come back to camp.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.119
Apparently, Luke and Mary
were actually hooking up.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.921
Yeah. Emily said
the same thing.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.156
After Paige supposedly split.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.593
Except Paige didn't go home,
not if this is her bag.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.528
And now Luke is missing.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.530
He and Cormac Barnes
are the only ones not in camp.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.665
Okay, let's collect
statements from everybody.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.266
Let's see if their stories
match up.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.168
Right.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.677
Luke and Paige were going
through a rough patch,

07:23.777 --> 07:25.679
bickering like
young couples do.

07:25.779 --> 07:30.150
Yeah, well, I'd say it was
a little more than that.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.521
I had a bad feeling
about those two from day one.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.489
Luke especially.

07:35.589 --> 07:39.059
He had what your generation
would call toxic masculinity.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.828
He was full to the gills
with it.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.831
Mary thought Paige
was a bitch.

07:43.931 --> 07:47.000
And she felt sorry for Luke.
That's why they hooked up.

07:48.536 --> 07:51.672
And, plus, he was cute.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.373
Lots of dead things
up here.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.043
It's the woods.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.410
Dead things.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.513
I thought Luke and Mary
were together.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.582
I never met Paige.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.151
I'm told she was a pill.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.586
Mary seemed nice, though.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.488
Mary taught me some yoga poses
for my bad back.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.257
I liked her.

08:10.357 --> 08:12.492
Mary was such a sweet girl.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.895
I feel like we failed her.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.830
I hope you catch the bastard
who did this.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.332
You better catch him
before I do.

08:19.432 --> 08:22.102
I can't imagine anybody wanting
to kill that poor girl.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.336
I don't know.

08:23.436 --> 08:28.275
Luke seemed nervous to me, stressed.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.944
Luke warned me about
dangerous people being here.

08:31.044 --> 08:34.447
And then he just disappeared
into the woods.

08:34.548 --> 08:39.286
Uh (chuckles) well,
Luke didn't want to be here.

08:39.386 --> 08:41.955
Paige dragged him up here
for his birthday.

08:42.055 --> 08:46.093
There is one thing
that might be a factor.

08:46.193 --> 08:51.899
Luke told me that he and Paige
had $15 million in crypto.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.968
When he told me,
I thought it was a joke,

08:55.068 --> 08:57.237
but, um...

08:57.337 --> 08:59.239
now I'm not so sure.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.450
Guess Luke left
in a hurry.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.452
Deputies already searched this,
you know.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.655
Let's look again.

09:14.755 --> 09:17.557
What Avery said about
the $15 million changes things.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.660
Okay, well, I wouldn't
trust Avery, all right?

09:19.760 --> 09:20.894
He's full of crap.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.129
I don't think he was lying.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.164
That son of a bitch charmed you,
didn't he?

09:24.264 --> 09:25.565
It was the accent, wasn't it?

09:25.666 --> 09:26.667
Uh-huh. Yeah.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.669
You know, an hour ago,
you were dead set

09:28.769 --> 09:30.337
on Tonya and Donno
being the killers.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.405
The money is something
we need to look into.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.076
Found something.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.849
Luke had Paige's phone.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.316
Wait.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.953
Emily said that Sunny
was receiving texts from Paige.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.021
I guess we know
who was sending them.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.489
Okay, so Luke kills Paige

09:49.589 --> 09:51.959
in a lovers' quarrel
in the woods, right?

09:52.059 --> 09:53.661
Hides the body, buries the bag.

09:53.761 --> 09:56.029
And then Mary finds the bag,

09:56.129 --> 09:58.966
so he kills her
to keep his secret?

09:59.066 --> 10:02.469
Strange he would run away
and leave this evidence behind.

10:02.569 --> 10:05.839
Yeah, something is just not
making sense about this.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.180
So being an errand boy
has its perks.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.515
<i>Is it the bourbon ♪</i>

10:15.615 --> 10:16.784
I'm a perk?

10:16.884 --> 10:18.118
That didn't come out right.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.319
Mm-hmm.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.689
How about we just dance?

10:21.789 --> 10:22.790
Dance?

10:22.890 --> 10:25.125
Yeah. Why the hell not?

10:25.225 --> 10:29.029
Well, you asked me out
for a drink, not a dance.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.867
And it's been a long day,
so I'm gonna take a rain check.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.836
- I'm gonna hold you to that.
- Okay.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.971
<i>Under this big sky ♪</i>

10:39.940 --> 10:43.343
<i>♪ Maybe I could
forget all that ♪</i>

10:43.443 --> 10:46.880
So, uh, I've been meaning
to ask you,

10:46.980 --> 10:49.382
did you ever find out
who my dad sold that truck to,

10:49.482 --> 10:51.018
the-- the one that burned?

10:51.118 --> 10:52.185
You know about that?

10:52.285 --> 10:54.187
I might've overheard you
talking about it.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.325
Um, no.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.828
I got nothing.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.930
I don't think your dad's
being completely honest.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.865
Sorry. That's just the truth.

11:04.965 --> 11:08.535
You think he has something to do
with the dead backpacker?

11:08.635 --> 11:10.337
No, I don't.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.773
It's just one of those weird
things I can't seem to square.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.175
You mean my dad
once owning a truck

11:15.275 --> 11:17.745
who you saw
some weird mountain dude

11:17.845 --> 11:19.279
maybe transporting
a dead body in?

11:19.379 --> 11:20.547
That's what you can't square?

11:21.982 --> 11:24.517
Well, when you put it
like that...

11:24.617 --> 11:26.453
How else am I
supposed to put it?

11:26.553 --> 11:28.355
I mean, the camp does own
a lot of trucks,

11:28.455 --> 11:31.959
and old ones--
too many to count.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.526
Well, what do you think
about it?

11:33.626 --> 11:36.263
<i>I know I shouldn't stay ♪</i>

11:36.363 --> 11:38.265
I think I should probably
head back to camp.

11:40.267 --> 11:44.471
And I think I'm gonna collect
on that rain check.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.406
Yeah, you should collect.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.942
You better bring
your best dancing boots.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.710
Oh, just you wait.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.946
Okay.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.716
<i>Change my mind ♪</i>

11:56.817 --> 11:59.452
<i>Change ♪</i>

11:59.552 --> 12:00.788
Oh, boy.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.802
Check that way.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.122
Is someone there?

12:41.094 --> 12:42.129
It's Hoyt.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.997
<i>We got a body down
by the Chimney Rocks.</i>

12:49.502 --> 12:51.171
It's Luke.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.008
What the hell?

13:04.918 --> 13:07.387
Okay. Yeah.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.989
I'll let you know
when I track him down.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.325
- Jenny?
- Yeah.

13:12.425 --> 13:15.162
She and Beau are
up at Sunny Barnes' camp.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.663
Two of their guests
were murdered.

13:16.763 --> 13:19.232
Holy crap!

13:19.332 --> 13:20.901
Well, who does Jenny
have you looking for?

13:21.001 --> 13:23.203
Cormac Barnes.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.006
But I was with him last night--
at the Boot Heel.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.009
Don't.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.710
Well, does he know
what happened?

13:30.810 --> 13:31.845
I don't know.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.181
He told me he was
going back up to camp.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.016
Jenny says he never showed.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.084
- Weird.
- Yeah.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.751
All right.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.491
Hmm.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.531
Hey, get this.

13:51.631 --> 13:55.235
Luke and Paige registered for
this trip under fake last names.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.237
Paige told Sunny
she had a trust fund,

13:57.337 --> 13:59.406
but in reality,
she was a data-entry clerk.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.573
So was Luke.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.675
They both quit their jobs
days before this trip.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.011
Okay.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.513
So this wasn't necessarily
a vacation, per se.

14:06.613 --> 14:07.580
Maybe they were hiding out.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.549
But the $15 million
Avery mentioned?

14:09.649 --> 14:10.783
I'm thinking they stole it.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.020
Could explain why Tonya
and Donno are here.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.022
- Maybe they're working a job.
- I'm glad you said it.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.424
I was beginning to think
Donno was bribing you
with his sandwich craft.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.392
Okay, you know what?
Let's not go there.

14:19.492 --> 14:20.760
'Cause bad guys
can have good points.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.030
Donno's just happens to be
sandwich skills.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.364
Oh! Donno's making sandwiches?

14:24.464 --> 14:26.433
I wish. But no. What do you got?

14:26.533 --> 14:28.235
Uh, yeah, so there's
a missing bow and quiver

14:28.335 --> 14:29.302
from the equipment shed.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.471
Arrows match the murder weapon.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.741
Who had access to that shed?

14:34.841 --> 14:37.210
Everyone.
They didn't keep it locked.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.146
Okay, so question is,
who had the opportunity

14:39.246 --> 14:41.214
to kill both Luke and Mary?

14:41.314 --> 14:43.951
We know that Cormac and--
and Donno were both missing

14:44.051 --> 14:45.118
the night of the supermoon hike.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.586
Avery and Buck
also could have done it

14:46.686 --> 14:48.555
when they were out in the woods
looking for Luke.

14:48.655 --> 14:51.158
Everyone else is accounted for
at the time of Luke's murder.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.093
Now we just got to
figure out motives.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.997
Huh.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.677
Who's this?

15:53.653 --> 15:54.654
Hey.

15:54.754 --> 15:57.524
Hi. I tried calling.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.326
And I went to your place
in town.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.628
Oh, sorry.
My phone must be dead.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.131
I thought you were
going back up to camp.

16:04.231 --> 16:05.632
What are you doing
at your parents'?

16:05.732 --> 16:07.467
Yeah, I just had to stop by
for something.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.502
- What's going on?
- Can we talk inside?

16:09.602 --> 16:11.171
Yeah. Come in.

16:14.907 --> 16:17.144
So why are you and Tonya
really here?

16:17.244 --> 16:20.313
Like we said, vacation.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.982
Does that include
killing Mary and Luke?

16:23.083 --> 16:25.218
You got me.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.353
Not.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.891
Why didn't you go on that hike?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.094
No group hikes for me.

16:34.194 --> 16:37.697
Alone, in nature.
Trees are my friends.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.267
So that would explain how you
got the mud on your shoes.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.338
Yes.

16:47.674 --> 16:51.778
Well, I wanted to go on
the hike, but Donno didn't.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.180
He's got a lot of rules.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.549
It's kind of odd, isn't it?

16:56.649 --> 16:59.052
You being up here
with your cook?

16:59.152 --> 17:00.253
I mean, the man's interesting.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.189
He's not who you think he is.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.856
No, I don't imagine he is.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.958
The man contains multitudes.

17:06.059 --> 17:07.927
Strong agree.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.796
But hiking isn't one of them.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.598
What about the marriage?

17:11.698 --> 17:14.901
I understand you're up here
pretending to be married.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.906
You get freebies if you say
it's your anniversary.

17:20.006 --> 17:23.243
You know, bottle of champagne,
chocolate-covered strawberries.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.978
So it's just a total coincidence
that you and Donno

17:26.079 --> 17:27.480
were on this trip at this time.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.748
Yeah.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.150
I mean, if we committed a crime,

17:30.250 --> 17:32.652
it's that we lied
about being in love.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.322
Good one.

17:35.422 --> 17:36.823
I'm serious.

17:36.923 --> 17:38.658
I named a sandwich after Tonya.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.661
Grilled with only
the good vegetables,

17:41.761 --> 17:44.131
none of the bad ones.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.099
I'm not buying it.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.801
I think you're here looking for
a lot more than free champagne.

17:48.901 --> 17:52.805
Speaking of marriages,
I met your ex, Carla.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.507
She's a boss.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.409
Really impressive.

17:56.509 --> 17:59.179
I don't know why you left her.

18:02.249 --> 18:05.152
Was actually
the other way around.

18:05.252 --> 18:08.188
But we're not gonna
get into that.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.157
Why don't you tell me
about Paige?

18:10.257 --> 18:12.159
Paige was already gone
when we arrived.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.527
That doesn't mean anything.

18:14.627 --> 18:17.164
You could have killed her
and then showed up at
the camp to get Luke.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.365
Why would we do that?

18:18.465 --> 18:20.333
Oh, I don't know. The money?

18:20.433 --> 18:23.603
You found out
about the $15 million,

18:23.703 --> 18:26.839
so you decided to kill them both
so you could take it.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.042
Or you were hired to.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.512
You have a fertile imagination
for a cop,

18:32.612 --> 18:34.214
but that doesn't explain Mary.

18:34.314 --> 18:37.350
Try this on for size.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.219
Mary found you
burying Paige's bag,

18:39.319 --> 18:41.154
so you had to get rid of her.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.989
That does explain Mary.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.360
But like I said...

18:47.460 --> 18:52.665
vacation, trees, fun, no murder.

18:52.765 --> 18:56.336
The person you really
should be looking at is Avery.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.004
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

18:58.104 --> 19:01.708
Well, his archery skills,
for one.

19:01.808 --> 19:05.077
Avery's quite the marksman.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.813
Avery? Really?

19:06.913 --> 19:08.147
Deadly.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.882
He surprised everybody.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.552
Well, just 'cause
he can shoot an arrow

19:12.652 --> 19:13.853
don't mean he killed Luke.

19:15.522 --> 19:19.359
Well, I'm guessing
that he's the one

19:19.459 --> 19:22.229
that told you
about the $15 million.

19:23.530 --> 19:24.731
How'd you know that?

19:24.831 --> 19:28.868
Avery was talking to Luke,
like, a lot.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.071
I'm just putting it out there.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.542
You can ask your daughter
if you don't believe me.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.346
But something was going on
with those two.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.860
Copy that. I got it.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.981
Avery.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.483
Hey.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.551
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

20:18.651 --> 20:23.222
Um, hey, Em,
when you found Paige's bag,

20:23.323 --> 20:24.324
did you have a look
through it?

20:24.424 --> 20:27.159
No. Why?
What is this about?

20:28.060 --> 20:30.497
No, I'm just wondering
if there's a-a clue in there

20:30.597 --> 20:32.399
about the crypto
Luke and Paige had.

20:32.499 --> 20:33.433
- Crypto?
- Mm.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.501
What are you talking about?

20:34.601 --> 20:36.803
Oh, just something Luke said.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.338
It's probably nothing.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.642
- Let's just leave the clues
to my dad.
- Absolutely.

20:53.786 --> 20:54.821
Wait.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.657
Mary and Luke
are both dead?

20:57.757 --> 21:00.427
Yeah.
Your parents haven't told you?

21:00.527 --> 21:02.762
No.
No, they haven't.

21:04.831 --> 21:07.700
I-I need to ask,
have you been here all night?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.001
Yeah.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.638
Yeah? Well, you told me
you were going to the camp.

21:11.738 --> 21:15.675
So is there something
you want to tell me?

21:18.177 --> 21:21.013
I was looking for the bill
of sale for my dad's truck.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.516
I was trying
to do my parents a favor

21:23.616 --> 21:25.318
and help you out,
of course.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.119
Well, did you find it?

21:27.219 --> 21:28.855
No, just the title.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.122
So he never sold it.

21:30.222 --> 21:31.624
Nope.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.293
I just can't figure out
why they'd...

21:34.394 --> 21:37.029
lie to me
about something like that.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.534
You grow up thinking
you know your parents,

21:41.634 --> 21:47.006
but you forget they had whole
lives before you were even born.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.841
What do you mean?

21:48.941 --> 21:51.210
Did you find
something else?

21:54.313 --> 21:55.348
Nothing.

21:55.448 --> 21:56.549
Nothing?

22:01.020 --> 22:02.722
We should head up
to the campsite.

22:09.796 --> 22:10.997
What's up?

22:11.097 --> 22:12.665
Hey.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.033
So, as you requested,
I did some research

22:14.133 --> 22:15.368
on Avery and Carla.

22:15.468 --> 22:16.736
Sent it to your phones.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.371
Pretty interesting.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.072
Are we really doing this?

22:20.172 --> 22:22.174
No stone unturned.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.876
Stalking--
that's a good look.

22:23.976 --> 22:26.345
Wrong. Investigating
a possible suspect

22:26.446 --> 22:28.280
that happens to be
my wife's new husband.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.517
- Mm-hmm.
- Also happens to be very good
with a bow and arrow.

22:30.617 --> 22:31.884
Yeah.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.221
Wow!

22:36.689 --> 22:37.890
This changes things.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.426
Yeah, it does.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.060
All right, I'll take Avery,
you take Carla.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.229
Keep it professional,
all right?

22:43.329 --> 22:44.897
Maybe don't mention this thing
between me and Avery.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.265
I'm pretty sure
she's aware of it.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.366
Just professional.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.201
Stick to the facts.
She's a lawyer.

22:49.301 --> 22:51.103
She'll use your words
against you, trust me.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.372
- I think I can handle myself.
- Well...

22:53.473 --> 22:56.275
Let's see if she knows
about Avery's little secret.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.645
- Good work.
- Yeah.

22:58.745 --> 23:02.415
"Carla de Lugo, Criminal
Defense Attorney of the Year"

23:02.515 --> 23:04.116
in Houston
for three years running.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.318
- Did Beau tell you that?
- No, he hasn't.

23:06.419 --> 23:08.488
He hasn't said a word
about you.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.490
Or Texas
or anything personal.

23:10.590 --> 23:11.791
Oh, well,
I'm not surprised.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.994
Beau had some issues
with people I defended at times,

23:15.094 --> 23:16.663
and then
he pretty much imploded,

23:16.763 --> 23:19.466
and so did
our marriage, so...

23:19.566 --> 23:20.800
I'm sorry.
That was off topic.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.469
No, go on, please.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.170
He never mentioned
the Hatcher shootout

23:24.270 --> 23:27.006
or the bike gang,
his partner?

23:27.106 --> 23:29.341
Not a thing.

23:29.442 --> 23:30.777
We just keep things professional.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.745
I'm sure you do.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.481
Uh, I just need to know
where you were

23:34.581 --> 23:36.783
from 6:00 p.m. last night
to this morning.

23:36.883 --> 23:38.651
Uh, after dinner,
uh, Carla and I,

23:38.751 --> 23:41.087
um, we had some
alone time in the tent.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.755
- We can move past that.
- Right, yes.

23:42.855 --> 23:45.324
Anyway, after that,
Carla went to look for Emily,

23:45.424 --> 23:49.161
and, uh, I got dressed,
did some work.

23:49.261 --> 23:53.666
And, uh, then we met up
for the supermoon hike.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.001
So you didn't
see Luke at all.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.103
No.
No, I didn't.

23:57.203 --> 24:01.007
Just, you seem to know a lot
about Luke, the money.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.208
Well, we chatted.

24:03.342 --> 24:05.111
He felt comfortable
opening up to me.

24:05.211 --> 24:07.279
About $15 million,
he just opened up?

24:07.379 --> 24:09.448
Well, I thought
he was joking.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.851
Like I said,
now I'm not so sure.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.986
What else can you tell me
about that?

24:14.086 --> 24:15.488
Maybe it was just
too much of a secret

24:15.588 --> 24:19.659
and he needed to share it
with someone and...

24:19.759 --> 24:20.660
he picked me.

24:22.428 --> 24:23.796
Hm.

24:24.831 --> 24:26.499
So then he lost
his partner, Randy,

24:26.599 --> 24:28.367
when the whole operation
went sideways,

24:28.467 --> 24:31.403
and he just
blamed himself.

24:31.504 --> 24:34.173
Just checked out
of everything.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.175
Some very dark days.

24:36.275 --> 24:37.577
I'm sorry to hear that.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.713
He's a good man.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.515
Yes.
Yes, he is.

24:42.615 --> 24:43.883
Anyway,
it all worked out.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.552
He seems to be thriving
as the sheriff here,

24:45.652 --> 24:48.187
and I am happily married
to Avery.

24:48.287 --> 24:49.989
That's great.

24:51.357 --> 24:54.426
Okay, so why don't you ask me
what you really want to ask me?

24:54.527 --> 24:56.062
This isn't about Beau,
is it?

24:56.162 --> 24:58.064
No, it's Avery, actually.

24:59.231 --> 25:00.833
I'm sure he's under
a lot of stress

25:00.933 --> 25:02.602
with what's been going on
with his company.

25:02.702 --> 25:05.037
What are you
talking about?

25:06.038 --> 25:08.174
You know, I've been
meaning to ask, um,

25:08.274 --> 25:11.077
how your company, Haypoint,
is doing.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.179
Oh. Yes, we're doing
rather well, thanks.

25:13.279 --> 25:16.515
I ask because I know
the SEC is initiating

25:16.616 --> 25:19.451
a fraud investigation
for misleading investors.

25:19.552 --> 25:22.288
Right, yes. I'm not at liberty
to discuss that, I'm afraid,

25:22.388 --> 25:23.923
so...

25:24.023 --> 25:25.391
Yeah.

25:25.491 --> 25:27.359
You know, I think I've told you
everything I know about Luke,

25:27.459 --> 25:28.695
so if there's
nothing else, uh...

25:28.795 --> 25:31.263
It's just that the $15 million
that Luke mentioned,

25:31.363 --> 25:34.266
that's, uh-- could be
pretty tempting

25:34.366 --> 25:37.737
to somebody in a financial
situation, you know?

25:42.975 --> 25:44.210
Am I a suspect?

25:44.310 --> 25:46.879
We're looking at
all possible motives.

25:46.979 --> 25:50.082
I see what you're doing.

25:50.182 --> 25:52.719
And I'm done.

25:52.819 --> 25:54.153
And I want a lawyer.

25:55.622 --> 25:58.725
Well, we both know a good one,
don't we?

25:58.825 --> 26:00.492
Yeah, looks like something.

26:00.593 --> 26:02.394
Working on it now.

26:02.494 --> 26:03.996
We're just gonna
have to find a way.

26:04.096 --> 26:05.632
All right.

26:05.732 --> 26:06.966
There you are.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.001
Nice of you to call.

26:09.101 --> 26:12.004
Heard all about everything
from Cassie.

26:12.104 --> 26:15.141
Well, sorry, but it's been
a little crazy up here.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.575
Yeah.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.345
Pharmacist was
a little confused.

26:19.445 --> 26:21.814
Said you, uh, refilled
your prescription

26:21.914 --> 26:24.016
right before this trip.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.685
He did.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.689
But your father spilled
some of them down the drain.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.624
You know
how clumsy he is.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.459
You got something to say,
son, say it.

26:33.559 --> 26:35.795
- Yeah.
- We got bigger fish to fry.

26:35.895 --> 26:39.331
Well, I had a look
in the attic.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.333
Whatever for?

26:41.433 --> 26:44.370
That old burned-out
truck Dad said he sold.

26:44.470 --> 26:46.639
I found the title for it.

26:47.874 --> 26:49.475
Huh.

26:49.575 --> 26:51.210
You sure it was
the same truck?

26:51.310 --> 26:52.779
I definitely sold it.

26:54.781 --> 26:57.349
That Cassie's got you
all worked up, hasn't she?

26:57.449 --> 26:59.018
Nope.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.687
No, she hasn't.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.126
But this has.

27:15.167 --> 27:19.138
Aww!
That's your cousin Bryan.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.407
Your Aunt Sally's boy
who lives down in Florida now.

27:21.507 --> 27:22.474
Uh-huh.

27:25.177 --> 27:28.347
He's the one that taught you how
to throw a football, remember?

27:31.684 --> 27:33.419
This is what has you
all worked up?

27:33.519 --> 27:36.022
There was a hospital
bracelet also.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.824
Oh, good Lord.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.692
Son, you need
to let this go.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.894
I mean, we got real problems
up here.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.764
And this has nothing
to do with that.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.399
So you won't mind if I share
any of this information

27:47.499 --> 27:48.434
with Cassie, then?

27:48.534 --> 27:49.702
Well...

27:51.403 --> 27:53.906
You need to steer clear
of that gal.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.675
We got a business we're trying
to pull out of the fire.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.945
Let's focus on that
and not all the junk

27:59.045 --> 28:00.579
that you're pulling
out of the attic.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.849
And I'd appreciate it
if you'd just stop lying to me.

28:13.926 --> 28:16.028
We can't do this
to him anymore.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.098
You want me
to tell him about Walter

28:19.198 --> 28:20.532
in the middle
of all this?

28:21.700 --> 28:24.804
Luke is dead.
That changes things.

28:26.072 --> 28:27.306
We got to tell him everything.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.608
We got to circle the wagons, Sunny.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.444
Why would we want
to tell him that now?

28:32.544 --> 28:37.283
Because maybe your boy Walter
killed Luke and Paige

28:37.383 --> 28:38.818
and the backpacker

28:38.918 --> 28:41.788
and God knows
whatever else he's up to.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.322
Don't you say that.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.958
Don't you dare.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.660
Well, that's the truth.

28:48.761 --> 28:51.663
You don't know
any of that.

28:51.764 --> 28:55.334
It's my story,
and I'm going with it.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.269
Damn near tells itself.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.150
A little early for happy hour,
isn't it?

29:11.250 --> 29:12.184
You want one?

29:12.284 --> 29:13.820
Thanks, but I'm working.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.254
Never stopped you before.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.993
I'm sorry.
That wasn't fair.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.929
That's fine.

29:23.029 --> 29:24.496
How's Emily doing?

29:24.596 --> 29:28.267
Fine, I guess,
just all things considered.

29:28.367 --> 29:29.969
She's tough, you know,
like you.

29:31.170 --> 29:32.704
Kind of describes you,
doesn't it?

29:32.805 --> 29:34.773
Touché.

29:34.874 --> 29:37.844
You know, being up here
reminds me of the time

29:37.944 --> 29:40.612
we went camping at Copper Breaks
when Em was just a baby.

29:40.712 --> 29:41.848
Oh, yes.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.449
Good times.

29:43.549 --> 29:46.452
Between the raccoons
and the tornado warning.

29:46.552 --> 29:47.486
Oh, those raccoons,

29:47.586 --> 29:49.021
they scratched the hell
out of my truck.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.123
Yeah, they did.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.726
And then we spent all night
passing Em back and forth

29:54.827 --> 29:56.728
-'cause of her teething.
- Mm.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.198
That was a good time.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.733
Yeah.

30:01.834 --> 30:04.003
It was.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.742
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.244
- Poppernak download you?
- Yeah.

30:12.344 --> 30:13.379
Someone in the camp,
you think?

30:13.479 --> 30:15.181
Well, we're still
piecing it together.

30:15.281 --> 30:17.249
But right now, we're still
considering everyone a suspect.

30:17.349 --> 30:19.418
I can help you
remove one name.

30:19.518 --> 30:22.521
Cormac was with me
at the Boot Heel last night.

30:22.621 --> 30:24.523
Then he went
to his parents' place.

30:24.623 --> 30:26.525
Security camera shows
he never left.

30:26.625 --> 30:29.195
I do need you to take a closer
look at Buck Barnes, though.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.562
What'd you find out?

30:30.662 --> 30:32.564
Turns out he never sold
the truck that burned up.

30:34.066 --> 30:35.567
I think
he's hiding something.

30:39.371 --> 30:41.673
We got to get that journal
and get the hell out of here.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.509
I hate to admit it,
but you're right.

30:46.112 --> 30:47.679
They ask you
about our marriage?

30:47.779 --> 30:50.749
Yeah. I had to admit
we lied about being in love.

30:50.849 --> 30:51.884
Is that what you said?

30:51.984 --> 30:53.052
Uh, yeah.

30:53.152 --> 30:54.686
Yeah, we're not in love.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.925
Okay, quick.
It's now or never.

30:59.025 --> 31:02.028
Mr. Donno.
Ms. Tonya.

31:02.128 --> 31:04.063
Hey.
How can we help you?

31:04.163 --> 31:05.231
Well, you know what?

31:05.331 --> 31:06.532
Since you guys showed up,

31:06.632 --> 31:08.867
nothing's been right
around here.

31:09.735 --> 31:14.106
Is that an
observation or an accusation?

31:14.206 --> 31:17.409
Well, Sheriff Beau said that you
two lied about being married.

31:17.509 --> 31:18.978
I don't like liars.

31:19.078 --> 31:22.481
Well, I think you've got
a little bit more to worry about

31:22.581 --> 31:25.484
than our little white lies.

31:26.618 --> 31:29.088
Murder.
Two murders.

31:31.323 --> 31:33.825
You know, lying's just
a stone's throw away

31:33.926 --> 31:35.995
from all sorts of sins.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.000
I got my eye on you.

31:47.506 --> 31:48.607
What was that?

31:48.707 --> 31:49.808
I don't know.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.678
I think they call it
cowboy mouth.

31:52.778 --> 31:55.247
She also may be a witch.
Let's go.

31:59.451 --> 32:00.752
You were unaccounted for

32:00.852 --> 32:03.022
when both Mary and Luke
were killed, Buck.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.856
Well, I mean,
like I told you,

32:04.957 --> 32:08.660
I was doing a safety check
for the night hike.

32:08.760 --> 32:09.861
Judging by the plaque
in the equipment shed,

32:09.962 --> 32:10.963
you're a skilled archer.

32:11.063 --> 32:11.998
I am.

32:12.098 --> 32:14.033
I am.
So are a lot of people here.

32:14.133 --> 32:17.536
By moving Mary's body,
you tampered with a crime scene.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.972
Well, I mean, I couldn't
leave the poor girl

32:20.072 --> 32:21.140
out there for the bears.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.509
Or maybe you did it
on purpose.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.345
What?

32:26.445 --> 32:28.180
No. No.

32:28.280 --> 32:31.383
For you to suggest that
I would intentionally hurt

32:31.483 --> 32:34.186
one of our campers, that's--

32:34.286 --> 32:39.291
When I saw that girl, I treated
her same as my own child.

32:41.893 --> 32:46.032
So forgive me for not having
the presence of mind

32:46.132 --> 32:49.668
to follow police protocol.

32:49.768 --> 32:52.004
We're just doing
our job, Buck.

32:52.104 --> 32:53.505
No, I understand.

32:53.605 --> 32:54.840
I understand.

32:54.940 --> 32:57.509
You guys have
any more questions?

32:57.609 --> 32:59.845
Actually...

33:01.580 --> 33:03.549
Have you seen this man?

33:16.762 --> 33:19.331
Yeah.

33:19.431 --> 33:20.999
I've seen him.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.839
I've seen him
out in the woods.

33:29.075 --> 33:30.676
Well, we believe
he may be linked

33:30.776 --> 33:32.511
to the Bleeding Heart Murder
from 20 years ago

33:32.611 --> 33:34.346
and the backpacker
who died recently.

33:34.446 --> 33:37.283
Holy hell.
Really?

33:37.383 --> 33:38.384
Yeah.

33:38.484 --> 33:39.918
Do you know
where we could find him?

33:40.018 --> 33:41.753
No.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.890
No, I, uh-- I've only seen him
a couple times.

33:44.990 --> 33:46.358
And not in the same place.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.026
Do you have any idea
who he could be?

33:48.127 --> 33:49.928
No, ma'am, I don't.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.130
Whew!

33:53.765 --> 33:55.767
Wish I could help.

34:01.373 --> 34:02.941
Hey.

34:06.412 --> 34:07.879
What's with
the silent treatment?

34:10.082 --> 34:13.319
You want me to talk?
Fine.

34:13.419 --> 34:15.954
I cannot believe
that you didn't tell me

34:16.054 --> 34:17.589
the SEC
is investigating you.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.991
- Oh.
- I had to learn about that
from the police.

34:20.092 --> 34:21.160
That is Beau.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.995
That is Beau, and he is
trying to sabotage--

34:24.096 --> 34:25.297
Is it true?

34:25.397 --> 34:27.166
Yes or no?
Is it true?

34:27.266 --> 34:28.800
- Yes, yes.
- Avery.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.170
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.504
But I thought it would
all be cleared up,

34:32.604 --> 34:34.606
and it will be, all right?

34:34.706 --> 34:37.476
I made a mistake.
I should have told you.

34:37.576 --> 34:38.677
Mm-hmm.

34:38.777 --> 34:39.845
But the problems
with my company

34:39.945 --> 34:42.013
have nothing to do
with what is going on here.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.451
When we get back
into town,

34:45.551 --> 34:46.818
Emily and I
are gonna get a hotel.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.654
- Oh, for God's sake--
- I need some time.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.756
I need to think about things.
I need a little space.

34:50.856 --> 34:52.424
Carla, please.

34:56.162 --> 34:57.196
Fine.

34:58.664 --> 35:01.267
I'll stay in a hotel,
and you can stay in the house.

35:01.367 --> 35:03.702
Then we can talk
when you're ready.

35:10.776 --> 35:14.380

35:14.480 --> 35:18.850

35:27.759 --> 35:29.161
Road's closed.
You need to turn around.

35:29.261 --> 35:31.163
Aw. I was hoping
to do some fishing.

35:31.263 --> 35:32.198
Not here.

35:32.298 --> 35:33.832
Is something going on
up there?

35:33.932 --> 35:35.834
I'm not at liberty to say.

35:35.934 --> 35:37.503
"Liberty."

35:37.603 --> 35:39.070
Interesting choice
of words.

35:39.171 --> 35:42.208
Liber-- the god
of coming-of-age stories.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.576
Is that what you're doing
right now, Ranger?

35:44.676 --> 35:46.345
Coming of age?

35:47.546 --> 35:49.047
Gonna need you to turn
your vehicle around.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.016
Not gonna ask again.

35:51.116 --> 35:54.853
Mm.
There it is.

35:54.953 --> 35:56.755
From a boy to a man.

35:56.855 --> 35:59.191
And so it goes.

35:59.291 --> 36:00.892
Listen, don't make me

36:09.535 --> 36:12.838
<i>Angel ♪</i>

36:12.938 --> 36:15.874
So you think
the mystery mountain man

36:15.974 --> 36:17.276
is the
Bleeding Heart Killer,

36:17.376 --> 36:21.213
that he killed Paige, Luke,
Mary, and Mark Woodman?

36:21.313 --> 36:22.848
Possibly, yeah.

36:22.948 --> 36:25.351
Emily mentioned
that Luke saw a light

36:25.451 --> 36:27.118
the night
that Paige went missing.

36:27.219 --> 36:29.255
- It could have been him.
- Any idea where it was?

36:29.355 --> 36:31.189
- No, she didn't know.
- Cormac might.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.024
He knows these woods.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.729
So where exactly?

36:37.829 --> 36:39.365
Right around here.

36:42.401 --> 36:43.702
The area that you're
talking about

36:43.802 --> 36:45.971
isn't on any of
the trail maps at the camp.

36:46.071 --> 36:47.573
That's 'cause my mom didn't want
any of the guests

36:47.673 --> 36:49.040
to go up there.

36:49.140 --> 36:50.976
Probably 'cause
my dad told her

36:51.076 --> 36:53.779
he saw your man in the woods
around those parts.

36:53.879 --> 36:56.047
Best to keep the campers
away from outsiders.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.150
Okay.
Let's go.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.653
You heard him.
Let's move.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.622
All right, everybody.
Let's go.

37:09.295 --> 37:12.831
Luke said the seed phrase words
were highlighted on two pages.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.142
Damn it.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.789
How much longer do you think
we should wait?

37:37.889 --> 37:41.660
I used to go duck hunting
with my grandpa.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.462
Dark, cold.

37:43.562 --> 37:45.364
The wait...

38:00.812 --> 38:04.115
So this guy here--
hard or soft?

38:04.215 --> 38:06.184
It don't matter.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.553
Pearlina will sort him out.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.404
Walter.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.673
Walter, are you in there?

38:27.773 --> 38:30.909
The sheriff's department
is coming for you.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.878
Please, if you're in there, run!

38:49.094 --> 38:51.530
Okay, you need to hang back,
keep out of sight.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.866
Please be safe.

38:54.966 --> 38:55.901
I will.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.445
What do we do?

39:06.545 --> 39:07.579
Nothing to do.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.782
No.
We can't give up.

39:10.882 --> 39:12.017
There has to be a way.

39:12.117 --> 39:15.186
You have nothing
to be afraid of.

39:15.286 --> 39:16.455
You've done nothing wrong.

39:16.555 --> 39:17.789
That's not true, Walter.

39:17.889 --> 39:20.759
If they take me,
I'll be dead by morning.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.461
Trust me.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.799
All right, what do we think
we're walking into here?

39:27.899 --> 39:29.935
I don't know.
He's been up here for a while.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.603
Paige could be in there.
Let's go.

39:34.906 --> 39:36.742
Listen to me.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.977
No matter what happens, okay,

39:39.077 --> 39:42.881
I need you to know,
you'll always be my prince.

39:58.196 --> 39:59.230
Come with me.

40:03.168 --> 40:06.304
It doesn't go far,
just to the edge of the woods,

40:06.404 --> 40:07.839
and then
you'll have to run.

40:13.945 --> 40:16.848
You go ahead.
I'll stall them.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.249
No, you're coming with me.

40:18.349 --> 40:20.752
If they find this cabin empty,
they will keep looking for us.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.654
Walter, I-- My leg.
I can't outrun anyone.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.956
I told you,
I'll always protect you.

40:25.056 --> 40:28.093
Sheriff's department!
Come out with your hands up!

40:31.096 --> 40:33.331
Hey.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.166
I love you.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.668
Now go.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.446
Anybody in there,
come on outside.

41:01.593 --> 41:02.694
Sheriff's department.

41:02.794 --> 41:05.163
- Hands where we can see them.
- Now.

41:08.734 --> 41:10.836
Hello, friends.

41:12.137 --> 41:14.239
Down the steps.

41:14.339 --> 41:16.341
Slowly.

41:21.346 --> 41:22.848
On your knees.

41:24.349 --> 41:25.851
Nice to see you again.

41:47.438 --> 41:48.874
Take him away.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.182
So what do we think?

41:57.282 --> 41:59.350
I don't know.
It just felt too easy.

41:59.450 --> 42:00.552
I'm good with easy.

42:00.652 --> 42:02.788
Take the W's
when we can get them.

42:02.888 --> 42:04.923
I agree with Cassie.

42:05.023 --> 42:06.524
Something's not right.
