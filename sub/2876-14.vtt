WEBVTT

00:04.337 --> 00:06.171
- Morning, roomie.
- Hey!

00:06.339 --> 00:08.882
You remembered
to put clothes on this morning.

00:10.468 --> 00:12.678
- Fifth day's the charm.
- Oh.

00:13.054 --> 00:18.434
It's so great to be back here. You're
making it so easy on me and Emma.

00:18.601 --> 00:21.520
It's great having you back.
Stay as long as you want.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.398
And when does she stop
crying all night?

00:27.444 --> 00:31.238
Hey! You're not naked. Heh.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.991
So, hey, Rach, when will we expect
to see you tonight?

00:34.159 --> 00:37.953
I'll probably be back around 6.
But she's in the bedroom, all ready to go.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.955
But she did fall back to sleep, so...

00:40.123 --> 00:44.209
She's probably exhausted from all that
adorable screaming she did last night.

00:44.544 --> 00:45.878
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:46.463 --> 00:49.298
Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it
too hard on you.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.716
No, hey, it's been great.

00:50.884 --> 00:51.925
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:52.093 --> 00:54.595
I want you to know that
with Rachel staying here...

00:54.763 --> 00:57.931
...all my feelings from before
are totally over.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.433
And even if they weren't...

00:59.601 --> 01:02.186
...when you walk in
on a woman using a breast pump...

01:02.353 --> 01:04.563
- Yeah, that'll do it.
- Wow.

01:05.397 --> 01:07.483
So how are you?

01:07.650 --> 01:09.651
- I'm okay.
- Really?

01:09.819 --> 01:13.947
Sure. I mean, do I wish me and Rachel
living together would have worked out?

01:14.115 --> 01:17.951
Of course. You know, I'm disappointed,
but it's not like it's a divorce.

01:19.579 --> 01:22.664
- Well, actually it...
- It's not a divorce. It is not a divorce!

01:25.001 --> 01:27.878
Anyway, I think Rachel and I
need to get on with our lives.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.380
Maybe start seeing other people.

01:31.299 --> 01:33.133
Wow. Really?

01:33.301 --> 01:36.595
Sure, why not? In fact, if you know
anyone that'd be good for me?

01:36.763 --> 01:40.015
- Sure. I know lots of girls.
- Yeah? Any names come to mind?

01:40.600 --> 01:42.434
Ooh. Names?

02:25.228 --> 02:26.478
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.606
- I was just gonna eat. Want something?
- What you got?

02:29.774 --> 02:33.402
Okay, let's see, we got strained peas,
strained carrots...

02:33.570 --> 02:36.155
...ooh, strained plums.
We haven't tried that yet.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.614
Goody!

02:38.324 --> 02:40.742
Thanks. Ha, ha.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.996
So how is it living with Rachel again?

02:44.164 --> 02:46.665
- I mean, apart from the great food?
- Ha, ha.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.834
I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just...

02:49.002 --> 02:51.503
It's just weird what's happening
with her and Ross.

02:51.671 --> 02:54.089
Yesterday he asked me to fix him up
with somebody.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.800
Rachel asked me
if I knew anyone for her too.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.052
- Why are they doing this?
- I don't know.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.597
They're so perfect for each other.
It's crazy.

03:01.764 --> 03:03.807
You know what's crazy? These jars.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.476
What is there, like, two bites in here?

03:09.981 --> 03:12.482
I just wish they'd realize
they should be together.

03:12.650 --> 03:16.236
When they moved in together, I figured
that's where things were headed.

03:16.404 --> 03:19.656
They should be a family. They should
marry and have more children.

03:19.824 --> 03:22.534
Yes. And they should name
one of their kids Joey.

03:24.370 --> 03:27.831
I may not have kids. Someone's
gotta carry on the family name.

03:30.126 --> 03:33.754
You know what? Maybe once they
start dating and see what's out there...

03:33.922 --> 03:36.506
...they'll realize how good
they are for each other.

03:36.674 --> 03:39.593
Yeah, because it is slim pickings.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.554
- I had this date last night. Yuck!
- Mm.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.849
But we should probably keep it down,
she's still in the bedroom.

03:48.019 --> 03:51.647
So, what are we gonna do? Are we
just gonna set them up with people?

03:51.814 --> 03:55.651
I know, that just pushes them
further and further apart.

03:55.818 --> 03:59.446
I know what we can do. We could set
Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates...

03:59.614 --> 04:02.032
...so they'll realize
how good they are together.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.368
- Ooh, that's a great plan.
- Yeah.

04:04.535 --> 04:07.246
You know what the best part of it is?
I get to do my plan laugh:

04:14.003 --> 04:18.464
Okay. Shh, shh. Not so loud.
We don't wanna wake up, uh...

04:31.354 --> 04:34.648
Hi. You guys aren't
doing anything tonight, are you?

04:34.816 --> 04:38.360
See, now, why would you assume that?
Just because we're married?

04:38.528 --> 04:42.739
I mean, I will have you know
that we are very hip, happening people.

04:43.533 --> 04:47.286
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to
get back to reading the obituaries.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.415
I was just asking because I need
someone to watch Emma tonight.

04:51.582 --> 04:53.375
Sure we'll do it.
What are you up to?

04:53.543 --> 04:55.085
Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.670
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

04:56.838 --> 05:00.841
- Why? What's the big deal?
- I figured because you and Ross are...

05:01.009 --> 05:04.428
What? Slept together a year
and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.850
I think it's great you're going on a date.
It sounds healthy.

05:10.018 --> 05:13.353
I mean, you have needs.
Embrace your womanhood.

05:14.397 --> 05:17.858
You want a job? Turn off Oprah
and send out a résumé.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.322
- I'll bring her by around 7, okay?
- That's perfect.

05:23.489 --> 05:26.533
You guys are gonna have so much fun.
She's at such a cute age.

05:26.701 --> 05:30.245
A couple things. Now that she eats
solid food, she poops around the clock.

05:30.413 --> 05:33.332
And watch out for your hair
because she likes to grab it.

05:33.499 --> 05:37.961
She's also in this phase where if you
leave the room, she screams, but, oh...

05:38.129 --> 05:39.963
...thanks, you guys. Have fun.

05:42.467 --> 05:46.303
Suddenly I wish I was reading
my own name.

05:49.098 --> 05:51.808
- Ooh, Joey, hey. I'm so excited.
- Hey.

05:51.976 --> 05:55.812
- I just set Rachel up with the worst guy.
- All right. Who is he?

05:55.980 --> 05:58.231
It's this guy I used to massage.
By "massage"...

05:58.399 --> 06:01.401
...I mean hold down so he wouldn't
turn over and flash me.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.154
Okay, okay.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.990
- Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
- Oh, yeah.

06:07.158 --> 06:11.495
She's this really boring woman.
She's a teacher.

06:12.789 --> 06:16.333
- A teacher?
- She's into history and foreign movies.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.044
Oh, oh. And she loves puzzles. Huh?

06:20.213 --> 06:22.422
Come on, who loves puzzles?

06:22.590 --> 06:25.050
Well, Ross does.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.928
You're ruining the plan!

06:28.096 --> 06:31.181
Joey, you fixed him up
with his perfect woman.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.308
- Oh, my God, you're right!
- Yeah.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.228
- She even reads for pleasure!
- Ugh.

06:38.106 --> 06:41.775
- How do you know a woman like that?
- I'm not allowed to know smart women?

06:41.943 --> 06:45.695
- Joey?
- I met her at the library. I went in to pee.

06:48.032 --> 06:50.784
- So now what do we do?
- Well, okay.

06:50.952 --> 06:54.788
I'll call her and tell her the date's
canceled and find him somebody else.

06:56.457 --> 07:00.085
What if we don't find him somebody
else? We'll just tell her the date's off...

07:00.253 --> 07:03.547
...but we don't tell Ross. He goes
to the restaurant and gets stood up.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.132
Ooh!

07:05.299 --> 07:06.716
Ooh, I hear that's bad.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.638
Ooh, so this is great. Rachel's
gonna have a terrible date...

07:11.806 --> 07:15.642
...Ross gets stood up, and then they'll
realize how good they have it together.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.185
Ah, yes, the plan.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.646
Ho-ho-ho.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.399
It's not Santa's plan.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.361
No, it's:

07:32.243 --> 07:36.079
- Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
- No, I think we killed it.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.084
Emma? Emma, look at me.

07:41.586 --> 07:45.589
Well, I think I'll go downstairs
for a while.

07:52.430 --> 07:55.223
No, no, no. No, no, no.
It's okay. It's okay. I didn't go.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.642
Don't cry, it's just a bit.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.854
I'm your Uncle Chandler.
Funny is all I have!

08:02.106 --> 08:06.109
Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be
ovulating from tomorrow until the 6th.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.446
So don't touch yourself
for the next 48 hours.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.657
I don't do that.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.201
I'll try to stop.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.163
- Wait, did you say until the 6th?
- Yeah.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.915
Today is the 6th.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.751
No, it's not. Look.

08:23.085 --> 08:25.795
Yes, it's also 2003.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.840
Oh, my God. Today's the 6th?

08:29.008 --> 08:30.842
I may be done ovulating!

08:31.010 --> 08:35.263
I may have also served some very
questionable meat at the restaurant.

08:35.722 --> 08:38.600
- Go take the test, see if we're okay.
- Okay.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.400
Tough crib.

08:48.152 --> 08:52.155
Hey, where are all my ovulation sticks?
There's only one here.

08:54.492 --> 08:58.161
I might have checked to see
if I was ovulating a couple times.

08:59.956 --> 09:00.997
Chandler.

09:01.165 --> 09:04.167
I am not working! There's not much
to do around here!

09:17.181 --> 09:19.266
Excuse me. Um... Heh.

09:19.433 --> 09:22.644
Is there a woman waiting at the bar?

09:22.853 --> 09:27.566
Um, someone average height, dark hair?
Or perhaps doing a puzzle?

09:27.733 --> 09:30.735
Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.

09:32.029 --> 09:35.365
Well, if I'm still here in an hour,
buy him a drink on me.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.410
Um, can I get you another glass of wine?

09:38.578 --> 09:41.580
I don't know if I should.
I don't wanna be drunk when I...

09:41.747 --> 09:43.873
...go home alone tonight.

09:45.126 --> 09:49.087
- Got stood up, huh?
- Eh, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.840
Are you worried your date came,
saw you and left?

09:54.093 --> 09:55.427
No!

09:59.640 --> 10:01.641
We're okay. I'm still ovulating.

10:01.809 --> 10:06.229
Oh, good, because as of 4:00
this afternoon, I am not.

10:07.481 --> 10:08.815
So let's do this.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.944
- I don't think I can.
- Oh, come on.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.572
I know you're not 18 anymore,
but give it a minute.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.202
- Because of Emma.
- Oh, my God, Emma.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.246
Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.208
Oh, you're right, we can't do this.
We can't leave her alone.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.294
Sorry.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.463
Unless...

10:31.631 --> 10:34.049
...maybe we do it here.

10:34.216 --> 10:37.052
I mean, how much can she even
be aware of at this age?

10:37.219 --> 10:41.431
Well, she's aware when we leave a room.
She may notice if we start...

10:41.599 --> 10:43.391
...canoodling in it.

10:45.019 --> 10:47.520
- "Canoodling"?
- Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw"...

10:47.688 --> 10:49.773
...in front of the B-A-B-Y.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.361
I don't know,
I guess having sex in front of a baby...

10:54.528 --> 10:57.906
...isn't so...
- Horrifying? Scarring?

10:58.074 --> 11:00.533
Something people go to jail for?

11:02.620 --> 11:04.245
- I guess you're right.
- You guess?

11:04.413 --> 11:06.706
At that bed-and-breakfast,
we didn't have sex...

11:06.874 --> 11:10.043
...because you thought a deer
was staring through the window.

11:10.211 --> 11:14.005
Well, what kind of a sick bastard
wants to do it in front of a deer?

11:19.887 --> 11:23.890
Wow, everything looks so good.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.476
I think I'm gonna have the chicken.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.399
I just have to say this.

11:32.566 --> 11:36.903
- You're really beautiful.
- Oh. Wow, that's very sweet. Thank you.

11:38.989 --> 11:41.074
I'm kind of funny-looking.

11:42.993 --> 11:44.911
- What?
- Look, I mean, come on...

11:45.079 --> 11:49.040
...you're way out of my league.
Everybody in here knows it.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.376
I bet that guy over there
is probably saying:

11:51.544 --> 11:54.421
"Ooh, why's she out with him?
He must be rich."

11:56.465 --> 11:58.425
Well, I'm not.

11:59.677 --> 12:03.179
What do you think you want to order?
I'm real excited about that chicken.

12:03.347 --> 12:04.848
I'm not funny, either.

12:06.559 --> 12:10.019
So if you were thinking,
"Well, he's not that good-looking...

12:10.187 --> 12:14.315
...but maybe we'll have some laughs,"
that ain't gonna happen.

12:15.693 --> 12:20.196
Well, come on, Steve, let's not rule out
nervous laughter. Ha-ha-ha.

12:22.199 --> 12:25.160
Hey, now, wait a minute,
Phoebe told me...

12:25.327 --> 12:28.455
...that you owned
your own restaurant. That's impressive.

12:28.622 --> 12:32.333
I lost it to drugs.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.382
I silk-screen T-shirts now.

12:39.550 --> 12:43.136
Really? What's that like?

12:43.304 --> 12:47.182
It's really fulfilling doing something
you hate for no money.

12:48.684 --> 12:52.353
That's right. I have no money,
I'm not funny...

12:52.521 --> 12:58.067
...I live in a studio apartment
with two other guys.

12:58.235 --> 13:02.822
And I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.703
Now, come on. Come on, Steve.

13:08.871 --> 13:12.207
There must be something
that you like about yourself.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.336
I do like my hair.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.131
Really?

13:31.185 --> 13:33.853
- Hello?
- Phoebe, it's me!

13:34.522 --> 13:38.316
I'm going to hunt you down
and kill you.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.277
Hey, Rach.

13:43.197 --> 13:46.991
This is the worst date ever! How could
you set me up with this creep?

13:47.159 --> 13:50.370
You know, you are talking about
one of my dear, dear friends.

13:50.538 --> 13:53.414
I don't care. This guy is a nightmare.

13:53.582 --> 13:56.292
All right, so he gets a little crazy
when he's stoned.

13:58.754 --> 14:01.589
- He's not stoned.
- Did he go out for a cigarette?

14:02.341 --> 14:05.093
- Yeah. Four times.
- My dear, sweet Rach.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.553
Oh.

14:07.346 --> 14:11.850
Well, our plan is working.
Rachel's having a miserable time...

14:12.017 --> 14:15.061
...and Ross is just stood up somewhere
at a restaurant all alone.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.272
Great. Pretty soon
they'll be back together.

14:17.439 --> 14:21.985
By the time anyone's figured out what
we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.781
Oh, wait, that's the end
of a different plan.

14:29.326 --> 14:31.452
Oh, she's asleep. Chandler?

14:34.415 --> 14:36.916
- What are you doing?
- Emma was doing it.

14:38.627 --> 14:39.836
She's asleep.

14:40.337 --> 14:41.379
Ooh!

14:41.547 --> 14:44.799
- She's asleep. That means we can...
- Yes. But we have to be fast.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.677
Oh, okay, I'll try.

14:48.012 --> 14:51.097
- And you can't make any noise.
- Okay, I'll try.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.397
Hello?

15:02.359 --> 15:03.985
Emma?

15:06.322 --> 15:09.407
Hey! Hi!

15:10.868 --> 15:13.620
How are you? How are you?

15:13.787 --> 15:16.247
Where are your babysitters, huh?

15:17.166 --> 15:19.709
Why is the bedroom door closed?

15:25.925 --> 15:30.929
You can't have S-E-X
when you're taking care of a B-A-B-I-E.

15:36.518 --> 15:40.772
I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.

15:42.524 --> 15:45.318
Eh, if it was meant to be,
it's meant to be.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.445
Look, you got stood up. Who cares?

15:47.613 --> 15:50.531
We're gonna show you a good time.
Sit and relax.

15:50.699 --> 15:54.327
In fact, let me bring you
a crab-cake appetizer on the house.

15:54.995 --> 15:58.289
Wow, free crab cakes? Well, that's nice.

15:58.457 --> 16:02.418
Although I was hoping
to have sex tonight. Heh.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.837
Ooh.

16:08.425 --> 16:10.635
Just the crab cakes.

16:11.011 --> 16:14.514
What are you doing? Are you trying
to get him to stay? You can't do that.

16:14.682 --> 16:18.518
- Just get out of here, okay?
- I'm sorry, what's going on?

16:18.686 --> 16:22.105
Uh, okay, um, the waiters have
a little pool going.

16:22.272 --> 16:26.901
We have a bet on how long it'll take
before you give up and go home.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.488
What?

16:31.073 --> 16:34.158
You're making money off my misery?

16:34.326 --> 16:37.036
Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.

16:37.204 --> 16:41.833
This is unbelievable. I have never
been so insulted in my life.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.753
Now, if you'll wrap up my free
crab cakes, I'll be on my way.

16:48.924 --> 16:53.052
Well, that was weird.
You were loud and I was fast.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.138
I think we may have done it this time.

16:55.305 --> 16:58.057
Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait
to take a pregnancy test.

16:59.476 --> 17:01.310
You may wanna get
some more of those too.

17:04.147 --> 17:05.481
Where's Emma?

17:05.648 --> 17:08.151
Oh, my God, where's Emma?
Where's Emma?

17:08.318 --> 17:11.529
Don't ask me.
I was in there canoodling you.

17:12.823 --> 17:16.117
Okay. Okay. I'm sure that Rachel
came home early and picked up Emma.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.661
You go look across the hall,
I'll call her cell.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.913
- Okay.
- You better hope we're pregnant...

17:21.080 --> 17:24.625
...because one way or another,
we're giving a baby back to Rachel!

17:27.796 --> 17:30.757
I can't believe I'm crying
in front of you.

17:30.924 --> 17:32.967
You must think I'm so pathetic.

17:33.677 --> 17:36.512
No, no, no, I admire a man
who can cry.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.474
- Really?
- Don't touch my coat!

17:41.685 --> 17:43.770
Oh. Sorry, that's my phone.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.564
- Hello?
- Hey, Rach, how's it going?

17:46.732 --> 17:49.400
Oh, my God,
this is the worst date ever.

17:51.695 --> 17:53.154
Oh, come on.

17:53.322 --> 17:57.366
Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did
you really think that this was going well?

18:00.287 --> 18:02.789
- What's up?
- Hey, did you stop by here?

18:02.956 --> 18:06.334
- No.
- Oh, my God! Then...

18:07.836 --> 18:09.796
Oh, thank God! Emma, there you are!

18:12.633 --> 18:15.301
What? What do you mean,
"there you are"? Where was she?

18:15.886 --> 18:21.140
Uh, we were playing peekaboo.
She loves it when I'm dramatic. Heh.

18:24.853 --> 18:28.648
- Why the hell did you take her?
- Because you two were having sex!

18:30.818 --> 18:34.153
- No, we weren't.
- Don't you lie to me.

18:34.321 --> 18:38.407
I can tell by Chandler's hair. You are
so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?

18:43.789 --> 18:45.790
All right. All right, we were.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.334
We were trying to make a baby.
Monica's ovulating.

18:48.544 --> 18:51.712
It is unacceptable that you'd
have sex with Emma in the next room.

18:51.880 --> 18:55.550
- I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.
- No, please don't. She will kill us.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.261
Hey, I gotta. Unless...

18:58.470 --> 18:59.512
Unless what?

19:00.264 --> 19:02.974
Unless you name
your first-born child Joey.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.770
- What? Why?
- Hey, I may never have kids...

19:07.938 --> 19:10.523
...and somebody's gotta
carry on my family name.

19:12.484 --> 19:15.069
Your family name is Tribbiani.

19:23.036 --> 19:25.121
Oh, ha, ha. You almost had me.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.920
- Well, um...
- Look...

19:33.714 --> 19:37.091
...I think I know the answer
to this question, but...

19:38.468 --> 19:40.595
...would you like to make love to me?

19:46.351 --> 19:49.187
Really, really not.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.356
Ah, it's just as well.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.901
It doesn't work anyway.

20:03.285 --> 20:06.454
All right, well, that's good to know.
Good night, Steve.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.675
- Hey, what's wrong?
- I just had a rough night.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.093
Oh. Crab cake?

20:21.303 --> 20:22.845
Ugh.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.348
- Well, what happened?
- Uh...

20:25.515 --> 20:28.434
Well, I... It's kind of weird
to talk to you about this, but...

20:28.602 --> 20:30.645
Monica told me you had a blind date.

20:30.812 --> 20:32.313
Yeah.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.689
- I did too.
- Oh.

20:33.857 --> 20:37.985
Uh, but is it technically a date
if the other person doesn't show up?

20:38.445 --> 20:39.487
Oh.

20:39.655 --> 20:43.324
Oh, no. Do you think she walked in,
saw you and left?

20:46.995 --> 20:49.330
Why does everyone keep saying that?

20:50.249 --> 20:53.584
If it makes you feel any better,
I wish my date hadn't shown up.

20:53.752 --> 20:56.629
- That bad?
- Well, he makes T-shirts for a living...

20:56.797 --> 21:01.008
...and he thought it would be
appropriate to give me...

21:01.176 --> 21:02.802
...this.

21:04.638 --> 21:07.348
"Female Body Inspector"?

21:08.475 --> 21:10.726
- What size is that?
- Ugh.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.479
Now wait a minute.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.982
- So they'll name their first child Joey?
- Uh-huh.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.859
How do I get them to name
the next one after me?

21:19.027 --> 21:22.822
It's easy. You just
walk in on them having sex.

21:22.990 --> 21:26.325
Oh, so they owe me,
like, three Phoebes.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.787
Oh, my God!
Look, it's Ross and Rachel!

21:29.955 --> 21:31.622
The plan is working!

21:33.250 --> 21:35.293
Don't do the plan laugh.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.839
The first dates we've had in months,
and they were both such disasters.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.674
Oh.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.885
Huh. You know, it is weird...

21:45.053 --> 21:49.515
...that Phoebe would set me up
on a date that was awful...

21:49.683 --> 21:54.145
...on the same night Joey set you up
on a date that didn't even show.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.064
Wait a minute.

21:57.691 --> 22:00.651
You don't think it was intentional?

22:00.819 --> 22:03.279
I mean, that's just stupid.

22:03.447 --> 22:06.615
We're geniuses. Huh?

22:06.783 --> 22:11.704
- Look at them! They're really bonding.
- They're falling in love all over again.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.083
Oh, they see us. Oh, they look mad.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.254
Oh, they figured it out.
They're coming. Run!

22:20.422 --> 22:22.548
- Where?
- Mexico!

22:28.305 --> 22:30.514
Can you believe they're still not here?

22:31.516 --> 22:34.894
I know. A double blind date
and we both get stood up.

22:35.062 --> 22:37.313
What are the chances?

22:37.898 --> 22:40.524
I know, I'm so bummed.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.069
Could we have
our free crab cakes now?

22:44.780 --> 22:47.531
- What?
- We've been stood up.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.785
And we want our free crab cakes.

22:50.952 --> 22:53.621
Guys, give it a rest.
Nobody's betting on you tonight.

22:53.789 --> 22:58.125
Although we do have a pool going
to see how long it takes that guy to cry.

22:59.836 --> 23:02.755
I have such fat hands!
