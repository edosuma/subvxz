WEBVTT

00:04.787 --> 00:06.520
(woman) Ã¢ÂÂª hey Ã¢ÂÂª

00:06.521 --> 00:09.524
Ã¢ÂÂª hey Ã¢ÂÂª
Ã¢ÂÂª come on Ã¢ÂÂª

00:09.525 --> 00:11.492
Ã¢ÂÂª come on,
come on, come on Ã¢ÂÂª

00:11.493 --> 00:14.195
Ã¢ÂÂª hey Ã¢ÂÂª

00:16.131 --> 00:17.231
Hey.

00:17.232 --> 00:20.568
Hey. I was--I was just...

00:20.569 --> 00:22.837
Trying on my
Halloween costume.

00:22.838 --> 00:26.107
What exactly are you supposed to be?
Space cowboy.

00:26.108 --> 00:28.342
Okay, "A," there are no cows in space.

00:28.343 --> 00:31.278
"B," didn't you wear that,
like, five years ago?

00:31.279 --> 00:33.547
So?
So don't you think you should move on?

00:33.548 --> 00:36.884
I like it. What are you
doing up so late anyway?

00:36.885 --> 00:38.385
Halloween homework--

00:38.386 --> 00:40.888
"the Pit & the Pendulum,"
the original "SAW."

00:40.889 --> 00:43.491
Have you decided what you're
gonna dress up as this year?

00:43.492 --> 00:46.326
Perhaps Indira Gandhi,
Amelia Earhart? Oh! Hermione?

00:46.327 --> 00:48.462
I think I'm gonna skip it.

00:48.463 --> 00:50.932
Skip Halloween?

00:50.933 --> 00:53.701
Well, dressing up. I'll still
hand out candy at the door,

00:53.702 --> 00:56.503
But I'm too old to go
trick-or-treating anymore.

00:56.504 --> 00:59.006
And you know how I feel
when the big kids come.

00:59.007 --> 01:02.376
I don't want to be that kid.
But you have to go with me.
You are my candy beard.

01:02.377 --> 01:05.847
Sorry, dad. You're just
gonna have to get another beard.

01:05.848 --> 01:07.982
This discussion is not over.

01:07.983 --> 01:10.351
So... Have you come up with a name

01:10.352 --> 01:12.820
For your parenting project baby egg yet?

01:12.821 --> 01:15.923
Wait. Let--let me guess.
Zac Eggfron?

01:15.924 --> 01:18.126
No. Egg Begley Jr.?

01:18.127 --> 01:20.461
I went Dickensian. Paige and I
are calling him Feggin.

01:20.462 --> 01:22.529
Get it?
Feggin?

01:22.530 --> 01:25.299
Fake baby egg.
Wouldn't that be fa-kegg?

01:25.300 --> 01:27.434
(cell phone rings and beeps)

01:27.435 --> 01:31.038
Beckett, what are you doing up so late?

01:31.039 --> 01:34.175
<i>(Castle) Ah, I just love
this time of year--</i>

01:34.176 --> 01:36.510
Crunchy leaves underfoot,
the crisp, clean air,

01:36.511 --> 01:38.445
The smell of jack-o'-lanterns
all aflame.

01:38.446 --> 01:41.415
Yeah, well, you wouldn't
say that if you were a cop.

01:41.416 --> 01:44.418
Halloween's one of the worst
weeks of the year for us.

01:44.419 --> 01:46.487
Hmm. The body's already in a graveyard.

01:46.488 --> 01:48.389
Someone was trying to save some time.

01:48.390 --> 01:50.724
I do love walking through cemeteries.

01:50.725 --> 01:53.560
I love their stories.
Check out this one.

01:53.561 --> 01:56.964
"Elizabeth Dryden,
December 3, 1962-?"

01:56.965 --> 01:59.033
If they don't even know when she died,

01:59.034 --> 02:01.468
What's buried here?

02:01.469 --> 02:04.605
Are you wearing suspenders?
Oh, yeah. I'm trying on costumes

02:04.606 --> 02:06.540
for my annual Halloween party.
Costumes are mandatory.

02:06.541 --> 02:08.408
What's the story, you guys?

02:08.410 --> 02:10.411
(Lanie) Take a look.
(Castle) wowch.

02:10.412 --> 02:14.048
(Beckett) Are you kidding me?
Is that a stake in his heart?

02:14.049 --> 02:16.517
Looks like Buffy's
visited the Big Apple.

02:16.518 --> 02:19.486
Someone thought he was a vampire.
So did he.

02:19.487 --> 02:21.622
And they're not plastic pop-ins either.

02:21.623 --> 02:24.292
Are you telling me those are real?
Or high-end veneers.

02:24.293 --> 02:26.427
Or he's a vampire.
No I.D. No phone.

02:26.428 --> 02:29.263
We got guys sweepin' the area
for anything they can find.

02:29.264 --> 02:31.833
No witnesses either.
(Lanie) looks like he struggled.

02:31.834 --> 02:34.268
I'm thinking he hit his head
on this stone

02:34.269 --> 02:37.638
Or someone knocked him in
the head before he was stabbed.

02:37.639 --> 02:40.308
Who would go to the trouble
of killing someone that way?
Lycans.

02:40.309 --> 02:42.310
They've been at war
with the vampires

02:42.311 --> 02:45.079
ever since lucian was murdered
in the 15th century...

02:45.080 --> 02:48.249
Again, this is just theory.

02:48.250 --> 02:51.219
(police radio chatter)

02:58.727 --> 03:01.829
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:01.830 --> 03:03.697
What is wrong?

03:03.698 --> 03:05.633
If he's a vampire
and you pull that out,

03:05.634 --> 03:08.903
He comes back to life.
If he does, then we can
all go home early.

03:08.904 --> 03:11.672
(squishing sound)
oh.

03:11.673 --> 03:16.143
Any idea as to who
or... What he is?

03:16.144 --> 03:19.313
He's human, and the fangs
are ceramic veneers.

03:19.314 --> 03:23.450
But he has two fresh avulsions
near the femoral artery.
Bite marks on his thigh?

03:23.451 --> 03:25.486
And I found these
on his body.

03:25.487 --> 03:28.356
They're synthetic. Your killer
was wearing a wig.

03:28.357 --> 03:29.991
It can't be easy

03:29.992 --> 03:32.059
To drive a stake
through someone's chest.

03:32.060 --> 03:35.396
To break the rib cage, you'd
have to pound it in with a rock.

03:35.397 --> 03:38.132
Someone didn't wash their hands
before the stabbing.

03:38.133 --> 03:41.068
Check out these black smudges.

03:41.069 --> 03:43.637
You know, have C.S.U.
Run the stake.

03:43.638 --> 03:45.806
Any match
on the vic's prints?

03:45.807 --> 03:48.642
Nothing in the system,
no hits with missing persons,

03:48.643 --> 03:50.978
No I.D.
But he has
professional veneers.

03:50.979 --> 03:53.847
Yeah. So?
I know the best fangmaster
in the city.

03:53.848 --> 03:56.617
Maybe he could identify him.
Fangmaster?

03:56.618 --> 04:00.054
Ã¢ÂÂª

04:02.724 --> 04:04.392
(buzzes)

04:04.393 --> 04:08.595
Ã¢ÂÂª

04:08.596 --> 04:11.399
(Beckett) I hope
this is for real, Castle,

04:11.400 --> 04:14.402
Because if it's not, we're
shortchanging our John Doe.
Oh, trust me.

04:14.403 --> 04:16.404
I can't believe you've never
heard of this place.

04:16.404 --> 04:18.406
I get all my costumes here.
(gasps)

04:18.406 --> 04:20.141
We can use this opportunity

04:20.142 --> 04:22.443
To find you one
for my Halloween party.

04:22.444 --> 04:24.611
How about... Slutty nurse?
Fantasize all you want, Castle.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.613
I am not trying on costumes for you.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.849
No? Why not?
You already got one.

04:28.850 --> 04:31.718
Who says I'm even coming to your party?
(ding)

04:31.719 --> 04:34.121
Richard Castle.
Change your mind?

04:34.122 --> 04:37.591
I'd love to fit you with
a nice set of doubles.
Uh, official police business today, doc.

04:37.592 --> 04:40.261
Detective Beckett,
I would like to introduce you

04:40.262 --> 04:42.463
To Dr. Barry Frank-- dental genius

04:42.464 --> 04:44.665
and fangmaster extraordinaire.

04:44.666 --> 04:47.401
<i>He did, uh, Brad Pitt's veneers
for "Interview with a Vampire."</i>

04:47.402 --> 04:50.304
So what can I do for you?
The master is in.
We're investigating a homicide,

04:50.305 --> 04:52.440
and our victim had some work done.

04:52.441 --> 04:54.175
We were hoping you could
help identify him.

04:54.176 --> 04:56.677
Oh. That's Crow.

04:56.678 --> 05:00.081
I did his veneers about, uh,
I don't know, two months ago.

05:00.082 --> 05:02.950
Crow?
Oh, people in the
vampire fetish community,

05:02.951 --> 05:05.319
they give up their mundane names.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.621
You're not gonna find any Daves
or Chucks or Megs here.

05:07.622 --> 05:10.591
He seemed like a nice kid.
What happened?
That's what we're trying to figure out.

05:10.592 --> 05:13.127
We were hoping
you would have a legal name

05:13.128 --> 05:15.662
Or a billing address.
Sure. Just, uh, let me look it up.

05:15.663 --> 05:18.599
Thank you.
Castle, what are you doing?

05:18.600 --> 05:21.969
(muffled voice) Do these
make me look immortal?

05:21.970 --> 05:24.438
Do you want to, uh,
go get something pierced?

05:24.439 --> 05:26.940
No. Do you?
Uh, wow.

05:26.941 --> 05:30.044
(woman)
this is Matthew's apartment.

05:30.045 --> 05:32.013
You'd think he'd be trouble,

05:32.014 --> 05:34.448
But Matthew
was a quiet kid, shy.

05:34.449 --> 05:35.949
Had, you, uh, heard

05:35.950 --> 05:38.119
Or seen anything unusual lately?

05:38.120 --> 05:40.421
The vampire thing was a little weird,

05:40.422 --> 05:42.890
But my first husband
was a civil war reenactor.

05:42.891 --> 05:45.426
So you tell me, which is weirder?

05:45.427 --> 05:47.428
(Castle) Ah, he was quite the artist.

05:47.429 --> 05:49.430
(woman) yeah, but mostly comic books.

05:49.431 --> 05:51.765
It reminds me of early Frank Miller.

05:51.766 --> 05:55.102
Which Frank--Epic Comic
or Dark Horse years?
Oh, my god.

05:55.103 --> 05:57.138
That is the sexist thing
I ever heard you say.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.407
I had no idea you were
interested in comic books.

05:59.408 --> 06:01.808
Oh, Castle. The things
you don't know about me

06:01.809 --> 06:04.645
could fill a book.

06:04.646 --> 06:06.113
Hey.

06:06.114 --> 06:07.948
Check this out.

06:07.949 --> 06:10.951
He was developing
a graphic novel.

06:14.622 --> 06:16.757
He's talented.

06:16.758 --> 06:19.493
Did Crow ever talk about
his family?

06:19.494 --> 06:21.495
Well, he never mentioned any.

06:21.496 --> 06:24.798
I just figured he was pretty
much on his own, a loner.

06:24.799 --> 06:28.669
It looks like he went to
the Barker School of Design.

06:28.670 --> 06:31.539
There's only a partial social.

06:31.540 --> 06:34.908
But we should be able to track down
his next of kin through the school.

06:34.909 --> 06:37.578
He ever have any friends
or visitors to his apartment?

06:37.579 --> 06:39.813
He brought a girl here once or twice.

06:39.814 --> 06:41.615
She was one of them.

06:41.616 --> 06:44.952
You could see them when she smiled.

06:44.953 --> 06:47.555
They did have a big fight
the other night.

06:47.556 --> 06:51.092
She was screaming bloody murder.
What did she look like?

06:51.093 --> 06:53.094
Uh, she had long black hair,
to her tush--

06:53.095 --> 06:54.995
Long black hair?
Ah.

06:54.996 --> 06:57.030
Did you get a name?

06:57.031 --> 07:00.601
No. He told me that she was
famous or something.

07:00.602 --> 07:04.438
Uh, he said she had her own
web site on the internet.
Well, we could check
his browser history.

07:04.439 --> 07:07.007
<i>(Bach's "Toccata and Fugue
in D minor" playing)</i>

07:07.008 --> 07:09.410
Hmm. You think they're real?

07:09.411 --> 07:11.378
Uh, the fangs, I mean.

07:11.379 --> 07:12.879
(Ryan) Vampire Mistress Vixen.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.881
Her coven is called the Den of Iniquity.

07:14.882 --> 07:18.552
Coven?
Yeah, a vampire coven is like
joining a church or a club.

07:18.553 --> 07:21.054
You like to play golf.
I like to play golf.

07:21.055 --> 07:23.991
You like to drink blood.
I like to drink blood.

07:23.992 --> 07:25.792
What? I...

07:25.793 --> 07:29.096
I used to go out with a girl
who was into the lifestyle.

07:29.097 --> 07:31.532
What happened?
Did the relationship suck?
(Castle) Oh! (laughs)

07:31.533 --> 07:34.668
The deal breaker? She wanted
to have sex in a coffin.

07:34.669 --> 07:37.505
I'm open-minded.
I'm not that open-minded.
(Beckett) All right.

07:37.506 --> 07:39.773
Did our mistress of the night
have a phone number

07:39.774 --> 07:41.708
or an address?
Uh, only an e-mail.

07:41.709 --> 07:44.578
However, there is information
on the coven's next gathering,

07:44.579 --> 07:46.880
Which meets tonight.
(beep)

07:46.881 --> 07:48.815
Damn. You need a password.

07:48.816 --> 07:51.952
Or an old girlfriend.

07:51.953 --> 07:56.890
(laughs) Hey. Whoa. I haven't
seen her in, like, a year.

07:59.494 --> 08:02.229
Fine, but I am not
sleeping with her.

08:02.230 --> 08:03.964
Ã¢ÂÂª

08:03.965 --> 08:07.601
Ã¢ÂÂª I don't want
to be here waiting Ã¢ÂÂª

08:07.602 --> 08:12.105
Ã¢ÂÂª inside misery Ã¢ÂÂª

08:12.106 --> 08:15.643
Ã¢ÂÂª just waiting alone,
and I try to... Ã¢ÂÂª

08:15.644 --> 08:18.011
Ã¢ÂÂª be alone with you Ã¢ÂÂª

08:18.012 --> 08:21.348
I'm looking for Vixen.

08:21.349 --> 08:24.251
Coming by. Pardon me.
Excuse me.

08:24.252 --> 08:29.623
Ã¢ÂÂª inside misery... Ã¢ÂÂª

08:29.624 --> 08:31.792
(laughs)

08:31.793 --> 08:36.063
Ã¢ÂÂª

08:36.063 --> 08:38.965
(exhales and chuckles)

08:42.203 --> 08:45.206
Ã¢ÂÂª

08:51.724 --> 08:54.125
You're, uh, sanguinarians?

08:54.126 --> 08:55.593
Blood drinkers.

08:55.594 --> 08:58.563
All of our blood play
is legal and consensual.

08:58.564 --> 09:01.433
We're not here about the club.

09:01.434 --> 09:04.101
Do you know somebody
named Matthew Freeman?
Who?

09:04.102 --> 09:06.237
Crow.

09:06.238 --> 09:09.474
Crow? Sure. Why? Is he
in some kind of trouble?

09:09.475 --> 09:11.709
We found him in a cemetery.

09:11.710 --> 09:13.745
Someone put a stake through his heart.

09:13.746 --> 09:16.614
(scoffs) What is this,
some kind of joke?

09:16.615 --> 09:18.750
Let's go make fun of the vampires?

09:18.751 --> 09:20.885
It's not a joke.

09:20.886 --> 09:23.655
No way. What?

09:23.656 --> 09:27.525
(voice breaks) Who would
want to kill Crow like that?

09:27.526 --> 09:29.561
We were hoping you could tell us.

09:29.562 --> 09:32.530
Where were you last night
between 11:00 P.M. and midnight?
(normal voice) I was here.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.632
W-wait. You don't think I'm responsible?

09:34.633 --> 09:37.735
We found synthetic hairs
on his body from a black wig

09:37.736 --> 09:40.338
and bites on his thigh.

09:40.339 --> 09:43.475
But I didn't kill him.
He was one of my lovers.

09:43.476 --> 09:46.010
So you saw him yesterday?

09:46.011 --> 09:48.012
Mid-afternoon.
He left at 3:30.

09:48.013 --> 09:50.014
Oh, my god. It's so awful.

09:50.015 --> 09:52.484
Vixen.
He's really dead?

09:52.485 --> 09:54.519
We have a witness who told us

09:54.520 --> 09:57.288
that you were fighting recently.

09:57.289 --> 09:59.991
Yeah, because he'd been
seeing someone else.

09:59.992 --> 10:02.994
Ultimately, we forgave him.
Yesterday, we were... Making up.

10:02.995 --> 10:05.162
That's why you found my hair on him.

10:05.163 --> 10:08.366
You said he was seeing someone else.
Daemon.

10:08.367 --> 10:11.636
Daemon fell in love
with Crow and his art

10:11.637 --> 10:13.605
And talked him into writing
a graphic novel.

10:13.606 --> 10:15.272
That's why he's dead.

10:15.273 --> 10:18.442
Their graphic novel,
"Blood Everlasting,"

10:18.443 --> 10:20.612
Is about a vampire in New York City.

10:20.613 --> 10:22.814
Only the guy that they were
basing it on was real

10:22.815 --> 10:24.749
and dangerous.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.518
A real vampire?

10:26.519 --> 10:29.053
He thinks he is.
His name's Morgan Lockerby.

10:29.054 --> 10:31.389
He was an original member
of this coven,

10:31.390 --> 10:33.391
but something happened to him.

10:33.392 --> 10:35.426
He lost all hold of reality.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.962
He started believing
that this was real.

10:37.963 --> 10:41.132
N-now he only comes out at night
and hangs out at the cemetery.

10:41.133 --> 10:43.801
(sighs) It was just crazy.

10:43.802 --> 10:45.837
How do we find this Lockerby?

10:45.838 --> 10:48.105
He's homeless,
but Daemon probably knows.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.374
Daemon have a last name?

10:50.375 --> 10:52.376
I don't know his real name.

10:52.377 --> 10:54.546
He was Crow's boyfriend, not mine.

10:56.415 --> 10:58.616
You know, what is it with these people

10:58.617 --> 11:00.652
and their dressing up
like vampires--

11:00.653 --> 11:02.319
The covens, the--the drama?

11:02.320 --> 11:04.822
Well, it's not about
the costumes or the makeup.

11:04.823 --> 11:07.592
A lot of the people who
are committed to the fantasy

11:07.593 --> 11:09.260
are a little different.

11:09.261 --> 11:12.163
They're just looking
for a place to fit in.

11:12.164 --> 11:13.665
Okay, that I get.

11:13.666 --> 11:15.934
It's just this whole
fascination with the macabre--

11:15.935 --> 11:18.870
The drinking of the blood,
the sharing of the blood,

11:18.871 --> 11:21.405
the, uh, having sex in coffins.
Mm.

11:21.406 --> 11:23.975
Psychology 101--they probably
had something happen to them

11:23.976 --> 11:25.476
when they were younger.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.879
Maybe they saw their dog
get hit by a car,

11:27.880 --> 11:29.948
attended an open-casket funeral,

11:29.949 --> 11:32.216
had a loss of a childhood friend

11:32.217 --> 11:34.485
or... parent.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.353
(police radio chatter)

11:36.354 --> 11:40.058
Some people become vampires.
Some people become cops.

11:40.059 --> 11:41.993
Okay. Then where did
your fascination

11:41.994 --> 11:43.595
with the macabre come from?

11:43.596 --> 11:45.162
What happened to you?

11:45.163 --> 11:47.999
(Esposito) yo. That art school
registration info?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.267
Court order from Barker came
through for Matthew Freeman,

11:50.268 --> 11:51.769
A.K.A. Crow.

11:51.770 --> 11:54.806
His family's in Connecticut.
Phone number's there.

11:54.807 --> 11:58.175
How'd it go at the club?
Um, Morgan Lockerby. Run him
and see what you can find.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.878
And see if you can find
Crow's friend Daemon.

12:00.879 --> 12:03.781
Does he have a last name?
I'm not even sure
that's his real first name.

12:03.782 --> 12:05.149
(mutters)

12:05.150 --> 12:07.551
What? You guys
are detectives. Detect.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.320
Good luck.

12:09.321 --> 12:10.588
Thanks.

12:14.292 --> 12:16.861
Are you okay?

12:16.862 --> 12:18.830
I-I hate this part.

12:18.831 --> 12:22.066
It's the, uh, phone call
that changes everything.

12:22.067 --> 12:24.502
I could stay if you like.

12:24.503 --> 12:26.303
Oh, no. Thank you.

12:26.304 --> 12:29.707
Sometimes it's easier
without an audience.

12:37.149 --> 12:39.851
(Beckett) Mr. and Mrs. Freeman,

12:39.852 --> 12:42.854
do you have any idea
who would try to harm your son?

12:42.855 --> 12:45.890
No. Matthew was very private
about his life.

12:45.891 --> 12:49.794
There was little we knew
about his so-called friends.

12:49.795 --> 12:51.929
Mom.
(man) I knew
those people were dangerous.

12:51.930 --> 12:54.532
I shoulda stopped him
from getting involved.
Alan.

12:54.533 --> 12:56.868
He was registered
at the Barker School of Design.

12:56.869 --> 12:58.536
Did he ever attend?

12:58.537 --> 13:00.471
No. He--he dropped out.

13:00.472 --> 13:03.107
And when was the last time
you saw Matthew?

13:03.108 --> 13:05.409
It's been months
since we've seen Matthew.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.146
No, it was Crow now.

13:08.147 --> 13:10.715
He came home.
He was dressed in black.

13:10.716 --> 13:13.151
He had skulls
tattooed on his arm...

13:13.152 --> 13:16.420
(voice breaking)
eyeliner on his eyes, fangs.

13:16.421 --> 13:19.090
I shoulda gotten tougher
on him.

13:19.091 --> 13:24.195
See? He was just
a... A normal little boy.

13:24.196 --> 13:27.165
And then he fell in love
with art.

13:27.166 --> 13:29.967
(sniffles) then he got moody
and--and... (sniffles)

13:29.968 --> 13:32.236
He started hanging out
with those people.

13:32.237 --> 13:34.405
When did you
hear from him last?

13:34.406 --> 13:38.309
He called a couple of days ago
and he left a message.

13:38.310 --> 13:40.812
(crying)
and he sounded upset.

13:40.813 --> 13:43.948
(Alan) but we never
found out why.

13:45.718 --> 13:47.218
(Esposito) tough one?

13:47.219 --> 13:48.820
Yeah.
They're all tough.

13:48.821 --> 13:50.354
So you got anything?

13:50.355 --> 13:52.323
Yeah, Vixen's alibi
checked out.

13:52.324 --> 13:54.325
We've been talking
to Crow's coven friends

13:54.326 --> 13:56.327
And searching through
vampire web sites.

13:56.328 --> 13:57.862
So far, no Daemon.

13:57.863 --> 13:59.296
What about Lockerby?

13:59.297 --> 14:01.933
Morgan Lockerby--
psychiatric disorder,

14:01.934 --> 14:03.735
35, committed by the state.

14:03.736 --> 14:05.236
That's the good news.

14:05.237 --> 14:07.739
Bad news is,
he escaped a few years back.

14:07.740 --> 14:10.441
Nobody's seen him since.
Got an address on file?

14:10.442 --> 14:13.211
No. He's completely off grid.

14:13.212 --> 14:15.179
What's your shadow doing?

14:15.180 --> 14:17.148
I don't know.
Last time I saw him,

14:17.149 --> 14:20.417
he was sifting through evidence
from Crow's apartment.
Hmm. So are you going?

14:20.418 --> 14:22.653
To what?
His Halloween party.

14:22.654 --> 14:26.224
I don't know. He throws
a lot of parties. You?

14:26.225 --> 14:29.393
Are you kidding? I'm all over that.
Hmm. What are you gonna wear?

14:29.394 --> 14:30.862
You want to know?

14:30.863 --> 14:33.765
You gotta show... To see
what I got going on.

14:37.970 --> 14:40.071
Hot on the case, Castle?

14:40.072 --> 14:43.407
On the case of a good read.
It's actually not bad.

14:43.408 --> 14:47.145
Esposito found
Morgan Lockerby.

14:47.146 --> 14:48.780
You mean...

14:48.781 --> 14:50.447
Morlock.

14:53.051 --> 14:55.753
Vixen was right.

14:55.754 --> 14:58.355
You smell like cherries.

14:58.356 --> 15:01.125
Hey, we got a hit on the...

15:01.126 --> 15:03.460
Are we interrupting something?

15:03.461 --> 15:05.663
Yes.
No.

15:05.664 --> 15:08.666
Okay.

15:08.667 --> 15:11.568
Wh-what'd you get
a hit on? (clears throat)

15:11.569 --> 15:14.872
The, uh, prints from
the stake in Crow's heart.

15:14.873 --> 15:17.241
Your girl Vixen was right.
Morgan Lockerby.

15:17.242 --> 15:20.477
Only thing is, he's one of
the great unfindables.

15:20.478 --> 15:22.780
No address, no phone number, no trail.

15:22.781 --> 15:24.515
Maybe not. Here.

15:24.516 --> 15:27.351
Recognize that corner?

15:27.352 --> 15:29.753
That's Broome and Clinton,
lower east side.

15:29.754 --> 15:33.257
I think Crow may have drawn us
a road map to Morlock.

15:35.000 --> 15:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:52.410 --> 15:54.511
(whispers) It's that way.

16:01.586 --> 16:05.889
You gotta be kidding me.

16:05.890 --> 16:07.892
(Ryan) You think he's in there?

16:07.893 --> 16:09.393
(Esposito) It is daytime.

16:09.394 --> 16:12.263
If he thinks he's a vampire,
that's where he'd be.

16:15.834 --> 16:17.501
I'll cover you.

16:17.502 --> 16:19.237
Together?

16:19.238 --> 16:21.405
All right. On three.

16:21.406 --> 16:22.773
Okay.

16:22.774 --> 16:25.576
One...
One...

16:25.577 --> 16:27.345
Two...
Two...

16:27.346 --> 16:29.914
Three.
Three.

16:29.915 --> 16:31.983
It's empty.
(laughs)

16:31.984 --> 16:34.986
(Ryan) you see him jump?
(laughs) Real macho, Castle.

16:34.987 --> 16:36.354
(laughs)

16:36.355 --> 16:38.890
Hey!
Hey hey, hey, hey!

16:38.891 --> 16:41.158
Get him off!
Get him off!

16:41.159 --> 16:42.860
Get him off me!

16:42.861 --> 16:44.362
Get him off of him.

16:44.363 --> 16:46.163
Aah! He bit me.

16:46.164 --> 16:48.266
Look!
He is a vampire.

16:48.267 --> 16:52.069
(groaning)

16:54.084 --> 16:57.320
(muttering)

16:57.321 --> 16:59.522
He's not a vampire.

16:59.523 --> 17:01.491
But his skin burned
when the light hit him.

17:01.492 --> 17:04.527
He has porphyria. Some people
call it the vampire disease.

17:04.528 --> 17:08.097
Its symptoms include
extreme photosensitivity.
(muttering continues)

17:08.098 --> 17:10.766
The skin blisters when it's
exposed to the sun.

17:10.767 --> 17:13.801
Victims are prone
to hallucinations, paranoia.

17:13.803 --> 17:15.671
That explains
his psych diagnosis.

17:15.672 --> 17:17.573
Exactly how contagious is it?

17:17.574 --> 17:19.142
It's a genetic disease.

17:19.143 --> 17:21.676
Besides, I put enough
antibiotics on that bite

17:21.678 --> 17:24.113
to kill a small animal.

17:24.114 --> 17:26.582
Now if we're done here,
I gotta head back to the slab

17:26.583 --> 17:29.952
and see a man about a corpse.
Thank you, Dr. Parish.
Castle was totally freaked out.

17:29.953 --> 17:32.555
You want to bite me?
You buy me dinner.

17:32.556 --> 17:36.058
(Morgan muttering)

17:40.364 --> 17:43.799
(muttering continues)

17:45.902 --> 17:48.204
Mr. Lockerby.
(mutters)

17:53.610 --> 17:55.778
(muttering)

17:55.779 --> 17:58.847
Morlock, do you know
somebody named Crow?

17:58.848 --> 18:00.616
Heartless bitch!

18:00.617 --> 18:02.685
Spots all over.

18:02.686 --> 18:05.020
S-spots all over.

18:05.021 --> 18:07.923
Were you in the cemetery with Crow?
Blood all over!

18:07.924 --> 18:09.525
Blood all over.

18:09.526 --> 18:11.327
There's been a murder,
Mr. Lockerby.

18:11.328 --> 18:13.362
Do you understand that?

18:13.363 --> 18:15.798
(mutters)
were you in the cemetery with Crow?

18:15.799 --> 18:18.801
We found a wooden stake with
your fingerprints all over it.

18:18.802 --> 18:21.070
Ah! The cat creeps in
to kill the bird.

18:21.071 --> 18:23.005
I should've buried you then,
wicked boy.

18:23.006 --> 18:25.208
I should've buried you then.

18:25.209 --> 18:27.357
Can--I didn't see.
I didn't see. I didn't see.

18:27.678 --> 18:29.613
I don't want to tell
the public defender

18:29.614 --> 18:31.615
how to do her job,
but I'm gonna say

18:31.616 --> 18:33.617
that the insanity plea
might be appropriate.

18:33.618 --> 18:36.119
Maybe the state psychiatrist
can help us make sense

18:36.120 --> 18:38.922
out of Morlock's rantings
before they take him away.
(telephone rings)

18:38.923 --> 18:41.491
Beckett.

18:41.492 --> 18:43.226
Okay.

18:43.227 --> 18:45.194
Thanks.
That was the lab.

18:45.195 --> 18:47.497
They were calling me
to tell me

18:47.498 --> 18:50.099
that the smudge on the stake
was India ink.

18:50.100 --> 18:52.035
Morlock must have gotten some
on his hands

18:52.036 --> 18:54.804
Going through a dumpster.
India ink?

18:54.805 --> 18:58.074
Yeah. Why?
India ink, or Chinese ink,

18:58.075 --> 19:00.644
Has been used
since 4th century B.C.

19:00.645 --> 19:02.746
When it was called masi.

19:02.747 --> 19:05.815
It's water-resistant, so it
won't smudge when colored over.

19:05.816 --> 19:08.351
It's also the ink used
by letterers in comic books.

19:08.352 --> 19:11.354
So if Crow was the illustrator...
Then Crow's friend Daemon
was the letterer.

19:11.355 --> 19:15.224
But what would the ink
be doing on the stake?
What indeed.

19:15.225 --> 19:17.861
You guys, where are we on the friend?
We're working on it.

19:17.862 --> 19:20.897
Yeah? Well, could you
work a little faster?
Hey, Castle, you wanna help?

19:20.898 --> 19:22.933
I would love to,

19:22.934 --> 19:26.069
but I have got
bigger pumpkins to carve.

19:26.070 --> 19:29.505
(man) Ã¢ÂÂª It was Halloween night
at the Castle hall Ã¢ÂÂª

19:29.506 --> 19:32.642
Ã¢ÂÂª and everybody came
to the monster's ball Ã¢ÂÂª

19:32.643 --> 19:34.644
(tool whirring)

19:34.645 --> 19:37.313
How's your Nosferatu coming?

19:37.314 --> 19:39.248
The key to a good jack-o'-lantern

19:39.249 --> 19:41.618
Is understanding negative space.

19:41.619 --> 19:44.454
It's not what's there.
It's what's not there.

19:44.455 --> 19:47.057
Ah, I have taught you well,
grasshopper.

19:47.058 --> 19:49.525
Oh. What are my two
pumpkin masters carving

19:49.526 --> 19:51.360
for this year's party?

19:51.361 --> 19:53.296
I am carving the traditional
jack-o'-lantern--

19:53.297 --> 19:55.665
Mr. Scary pumpkin face.

19:55.666 --> 19:58.068
Aw.

19:58.069 --> 20:00.837
And I am carving Max Schreck
in his role as Count Orlok.

20:00.838 --> 20:04.574
Dad's a little vampire obsessed
because of his case.
Mm-hmm.

20:04.575 --> 20:07.777
Or maybe it's because
of the bite.

20:07.778 --> 20:09.779
I swear,
you have missed your calling.

20:09.780 --> 20:12.148
I don't even know
why you bother to write.

20:12.149 --> 20:15.118
Hey, you want to carve with us?
Oh, can't. I'm off to a masquerade ball.

20:15.119 --> 20:17.520
Perhaps I'll meet my Gatsby.

20:17.521 --> 20:19.923
Oh.
Oh! Mother, I'm impressed.

20:19.924 --> 20:23.026
You still fit into your prom dress.
Oh, thank you, darling.

20:23.027 --> 20:26.696
(lowered voice) have you asked him yet?
(lowered voice) I was waiting
for the right moment.

20:26.697 --> 20:28.498
Oh.
(lowered voice) asked me what?

20:28.499 --> 20:31.400
(normal voice) Paige and I got
invited to a party tomorrow--

20:31.401 --> 20:34.403
the night before Halloween-- by seniors.
By your grandmother's friends?

20:34.404 --> 20:37.674
No, dad. Twelfth graders.
But it'll be supervised.

20:37.675 --> 20:40.644
(sighs) This is one of those
crossroads moments, isn't it?

20:40.645 --> 20:42.145
Oh, let her go.

20:42.146 --> 20:44.714
She's far more responsible
than you ever were.

20:44.715 --> 20:46.449
Yes, you can go.

20:46.450 --> 20:49.019
<i>But if anything happens that
makes you feel uncomfortable,</i>

20:49.020 --> 20:52.856
anything at all, you call me.
I don't care what it is.

20:52.857 --> 20:54.958
And there'll be no punishments,
no recriminations, nothing,

20:54.959 --> 20:57.661
I promise, just so long as you call.
Okay.

20:57.662 --> 21:00.530
Yeah, yeah, I will, I promise.
But nothing's gonna happen.

21:00.531 --> 21:02.699
But there's one more thing, though.
Yes.

21:02.700 --> 21:04.801
Will you watch Feggin?
Why, is he gonna hatch?

21:04.802 --> 21:07.537
No. Our health teacher says
we can't leave him alone.

21:07.538 --> 21:09.806
That's considered egg abuse.

21:09.807 --> 21:11.875
And since Paige and I
are co-parenting,

21:11.876 --> 21:13.910
and we're both
going to the party

21:13.911 --> 21:17.313
and her parents are going out,
we need a sitter.
Oh, no. Sorry. Uh, plans.

21:17.314 --> 21:19.816
Yeah, okay. Sure. I'll watch
your little egg child.

21:19.817 --> 21:23.452
But I want you to know, I'm far
too young to be a grandparent.

21:23.453 --> 21:26.089
And if, uh, any of those
senior boys bother you...

21:26.090 --> 21:28.524
(imitates Norman Bates)
father won't be quite himself.

21:28.525 --> 21:30.493
(tool whirring)

21:30.494 --> 21:34.363
(laughs evilly)

21:36.466 --> 21:38.868
(coughs)
(Beckett) he mumbles,

21:38.869 --> 21:40.870
he shouts, he throws himself
against the bars,

21:40.871 --> 21:42.872
but the's just
something about it.

21:42.873 --> 21:45.041
Although someone
like Mr. Lockerby

21:45.042 --> 21:47.977
will present as completely
non compos mentis...
Mm-hmm.

21:47.978 --> 21:50.747
He could still have moments
of lucidity.

21:50.748 --> 21:52.749
The difficulty

21:52.750 --> 21:55.518
is separating the fantasy
from the reality.

21:55.519 --> 21:57.553
Well, these were drawn
by our victim.

21:57.554 --> 21:59.522
I was wondering
if they suggested anything

21:59.523 --> 22:02.491
about his relationship
with Mr. Lockerby.

22:05.429 --> 22:08.264
I'd have to study them more
to give you a diagnosis,

22:08.265 --> 22:10.433
but these are more about
the woman in the drawings

22:10.434 --> 22:12.468
than Lockerby.
What do you mean?

22:12.469 --> 22:14.570
He draws her as an angel,

22:14.571 --> 22:17.073
but always in the context
of an act of violence.

22:17.074 --> 22:20.309
Honestly? It looks to me like the work
of someone who was once traumatized.

22:20.310 --> 22:23.379
Uh, childhood trauma.
What'd I tell you?

22:23.380 --> 22:25.448
Doc Holloway,
this is Richard Castle.

22:25.449 --> 22:28.084
Dr. Holloway. Say hello to
the nice psychiatrist, Feggin.

22:28.085 --> 22:29.518
Hello.

22:31.488 --> 22:33.689
I will arrange for someone

22:33.690 --> 22:36.525
from social services
to come get Mr. Lockerby.

22:36.526 --> 22:39.729
And if you want, I can have
someone get him, too.
(whispers) Yes, please.

22:39.730 --> 22:41.731
(normal voice) Are you gonna eat that?

22:41.732 --> 22:44.367
Eat my own grandchild?
What am I, a monster?

22:44.368 --> 22:46.402
Maybe that bite
was catching.

22:46.403 --> 22:48.371
It's a school
health sciences project--

22:48.372 --> 22:50.506
Helping de-romanticize
having a family

22:50.507 --> 22:53.076
before you're ready
to take responsibility.
Mm.

22:53.077 --> 22:55.411
Alexis and Paige
are going to

22:55.412 --> 22:58.114
their first senior party
tonight, so I'm babysitting.

22:58.115 --> 22:59.949
Egg-sitting.
Senior party, huh?

22:59.950 --> 23:01.751
What?

23:01.752 --> 23:04.287
(telephone rings)

23:04.288 --> 23:06.389
Beckett.
(mouths word)

23:06.390 --> 23:08.858
We showed Crow's picture
around the neighborhood.

23:08.859 --> 23:10.827
We got a lead
on his friend Daemon.

23:10.828 --> 23:13.496
You're not gonna believe this.
The guy is dead.

23:13.497 --> 23:16.065
Shot right through the heart,
and his place has been tossed.

23:16.066 --> 23:19.669
Oh... And, uh...

23:19.670 --> 23:22.571
He's a werewolf.

23:26.271 --> 23:28.439
Silver bullet?

23:28.440 --> 23:31.841
No, 9 millimeter.
Then I guess he's not a real werewolf.

23:31.842 --> 23:34.911
Nice. The hairs on his face
and hands are synthetic,

23:34.912 --> 23:37.214
attached with spirit gum.

23:37.215 --> 23:40.584
It's a Halloween costume.
According to his driver's license,

23:40.585 --> 23:43.120
Daemon's real name
was Jonas Westfall.

23:43.121 --> 23:45.155
He's a graduate student--
N.Y.U.--

23:45.156 --> 23:46.990
In forensic anthropology.

23:46.991 --> 23:49.359
Then that explains the bones.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.228
Castle, don't touch.
I know.

23:51.229 --> 23:53.397
(Ryan) Canvassed the building.

23:53.398 --> 23:58.302
Neighbor remembers hearing
something the other day,

23:58.303 --> 24:00.370
based on deterioration
and lividity

24:00.371 --> 24:02.372
and the smell of that
old Thai food,

24:02.373 --> 24:05.209
wolf boy was killed
the same day as our vampire.

24:05.210 --> 24:07.344
I'd say a couple of hours before.

24:07.345 --> 24:09.313
Ryan, track down the delivery guy.

24:09.314 --> 24:11.515
Find out when this was delivered

24:11.516 --> 24:14.184
and whether anyone else
was up here when he brought it.

24:14.185 --> 24:16.520
"Come as your alter ego"?

24:16.521 --> 24:19.623
"October 27th at 7:00 P.M."
our guy was going to this party.

24:19.624 --> 24:22.292
Same day that Crow was killed.

24:22.293 --> 24:24.328
(Lanie) I assume there's a connection.
(Castle) Hey.

24:24.329 --> 24:25.862
India ink,

24:25.863 --> 24:28.698
which means Crow's killer
was in the apartment, too.

24:28.699 --> 24:31.168
(Beckett) but what
were they looking for?

24:33.771 --> 24:35.472
Castle.

24:37.208 --> 24:38.908
Morlock?

24:38.909 --> 24:41.845
He comes here, shoots Daemon,
grabs a stake goes off and kills Crow.

24:41.846 --> 24:45.015
And in the struggle,
the ink bottle is broken.

24:45.016 --> 24:49.052
Wasn't Morlock. This victim
was killed during the day.

24:49.053 --> 24:51.955
Morlock had porphyria.
He would've burnt to a crisp.

24:51.956 --> 24:55.492
So if he didn't kill our werewolf...
Then chances are he didn't
kill our vampire.

24:55.493 --> 24:58.862
Well, then how did the prints
get on the stake?
Maybe he was trying to help him.

24:58.863 --> 25:01.165
Maybe he was trying
to save his friend.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.733
Are you sure
about the time of death?

25:03.734 --> 25:06.903
His watch broke when he fell.
It says 4:00, October 27th.

25:06.904 --> 25:09.072
Well, then if it
wasn't Morlock, who was it?

25:09.073 --> 25:11.608
And what were they
looking for?

25:11.609 --> 25:14.077
Uh... I don't know
what they were looking for,

25:14.078 --> 25:16.946
but I think I know
what our vic was hiding.

25:24.556 --> 25:26.990
So Jonas Westfall,
A.K.A. Daemon,

25:26.991 --> 25:29.660
was inches away
from getting his Master's

25:29.661 --> 25:31.895
in forensic science from N.Y.U.

25:31.896 --> 25:33.963
This all looks like
part of his research.

25:33.964 --> 25:35.932
I went through
a bone collecting phase

25:35.933 --> 25:38.368
when I was a kid.

25:38.369 --> 25:40.837
So whatever happened to you
happened when you were young.

25:40.838 --> 25:43.840
What was it, Castle?
Did you witness a murder?

25:43.841 --> 25:46.443
Or did you skin your knee
and it bled?

25:46.444 --> 25:47.911
Hmm. Speaking of trauma,

25:47.912 --> 25:50.814
I wonder how late Alexis
is gonna be at her party.

25:50.815 --> 25:52.849
Poor Feggin is suffering
from separation issues.

25:52.850 --> 25:55.151
Come on, Castle.
You know mine. Tit for tat.

25:55.152 --> 25:57.153
Just because
I've seen your tat

25:57.154 --> 25:59.289
doesn't mean
I'm gonna show you my...

25:59.290 --> 26:02.593
Check this out.
Uh, dated two years ago--

26:02.594 --> 26:05.028
"A murdered woman was unearthed
in the Pennsylvania woods

26:05.029 --> 26:07.030
"above Lehigh River
late Sunday night.

26:07.031 --> 26:08.765
"Investigators say she had been

26:08.766 --> 26:11.735
buried in the shallow grave for years."
And?

26:11.736 --> 26:13.737
"Based on the remains,
investigators have attempted

26:13.738 --> 26:16.072
a forensic reconstruction
of the murdered woman's face."

26:16.073 --> 26:17.941
That's the woman
from Crow's drawings.

26:17.942 --> 26:20.176
Yet in the graphic novel,

26:20.177 --> 26:23.046
she consistently appears
as the angel of death.

26:23.047 --> 26:25.549
Okay, so Crow became obsessed
with Daemon's case study.

26:25.550 --> 26:28.017
Why would they go to
this much trouble to hide it?

26:28.018 --> 26:30.754
Why would someone kill
to find it?

26:30.755 --> 26:33.056
Castle.

26:33.057 --> 26:34.758
Hmm?

26:34.759 --> 26:37.361
These sketches
were drawn four years ago.

26:37.362 --> 26:38.928
No, no that's impossible.

26:38.929 --> 26:41.030
This body wasn't discovered
until two years ago.

26:41.031 --> 26:42.866
So either Crow
is psychic or...

26:42.867 --> 26:45.736
Or he knew this woman
before she died.

26:45.737 --> 26:49.439
(cell phone rings and beeps)
Hey, Alexis. How you doing?
Everything okay?

26:49.440 --> 26:51.007
No, dad. It's Paige.

26:51.008 --> 26:53.744
I think the punch is spiked,
and she had too much to drink.

26:53.745 --> 26:56.880
I'm afraid something's
gonna happen to her.
I'm on my way.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.587
Oh, my god.
Is she all right?

27:03.588 --> 27:06.055
I don't know. She was
swapping drinks for kisses,

27:06.056 --> 27:09.092
and I tried to pull her away,
but she wouldn't let me.

27:09.093 --> 27:12.362
Would you get me a glass of water?
(Paige, slurring words)
leave me alone, 'lexis.

27:12.363 --> 27:14.765
Paige.
Now you're sure she hasn't been
throwing up or unconscious?

27:14.766 --> 27:17.200
No, just falling down.
All right. Call her parents.

27:17.201 --> 27:20.637
(slurring) don't do it.
Oh, my 'rents... 'urder me.

27:20.638 --> 27:23.973
Don' do it, Mr. Castle.
Jus' let me sleep over.

27:23.974 --> 27:25.776
What is she saying?
It's just drunk talk.

27:25.777 --> 27:27.877
She says don't call her parents
or they'll murder her.

27:27.878 --> 27:30.113
Just let her sleep over.
Do we have to call her parents?

27:30.114 --> 27:33.149
We do. Get me their number.
She'll get in so much trouble.

27:33.150 --> 27:35.084
Less than if you
had left her there.

27:35.085 --> 27:37.854
(mouths word)
Now.

27:37.855 --> 27:41.458
(keypad beeps)

27:41.459 --> 27:44.961
Try to get her to drink that.
Please.

27:48.301 --> 27:52.070
Adora.
That's what he called her.

27:52.071 --> 27:54.673
We've seen her in Matthew's
artwork for years.

27:54.674 --> 27:57.075
Do you know who she is?

27:57.076 --> 28:00.012
No, we just assumed that she was
a figment of his imagination.

28:00.013 --> 28:03.382
He called her
his own personal ghost.

28:03.383 --> 28:06.184
He said she appeared
in his dreams and nightmares.

28:06.185 --> 28:09.021
Well, she's not a figment.

28:09.022 --> 28:10.623
She's very real.

28:14.895 --> 28:18.230
Are you sure
you don't recognize her?

28:18.231 --> 28:20.265
Because she could be anybody.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.735
She could be a teacher, a neighbor.
No, I-I'm certain.

28:22.736 --> 28:24.937
We've only seen her
in his art.

28:24.938 --> 28:27.606
Do you know if your son
experienced anything traumatic

28:27.607 --> 28:29.774
when he was younger?
What do you mean?

28:29.775 --> 28:31.810
I showed some of
Matthew's drawings

28:31.811 --> 28:35.280
to one of our therapists,
and he said that it looked like

28:35.281 --> 28:37.182
he might have witnessed
something disturbing,

28:37.183 --> 28:39.151
seen something very violent.

28:39.152 --> 28:42.521
I-I really can't think of anything.

28:42.522 --> 28:45.624
Do you have any of
Matthew's earlier drawings

28:45.625 --> 28:47.092
of this woman?

28:47.093 --> 28:49.928
No. He took it all
with him when he left.
Yeah.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.931
Um, you might want to check
the portfolio

28:51.932 --> 28:54.466
with his application for Barker.

28:54.467 --> 28:58.236
All the work he cared about,
he put in there.
Thank you, Rosie. We'll look into it.

29:03.577 --> 29:05.143
What, no Castle?

29:05.144 --> 29:08.948
Uh, no. He had a late night.
What's up?

29:08.949 --> 29:10.916
I was talking to
the Pennsylvania state police

29:10.917 --> 29:12.817
about our victim's mystery woman,
and they said I was the second person

29:12.818 --> 29:15.888
to call in the last two weeks about
the woman they found in the woods.

29:15.889 --> 29:18.724
Did they tell you who else called?

29:18.725 --> 29:20.358
Jonas Westfall.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.294
Daemon.
Yep, our werewolf.

29:22.295 --> 29:24.663
And their forensics expert
determined that

29:24.664 --> 29:27.666
the woman died 18 years ago from
a gunshot wound to the chest

29:27.667 --> 29:30.869
from a 9-millimeter handgun.
Same as Daemon.

29:30.870 --> 29:33.872
So I thought, what the hell?
Compare the ballistics.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.908
The bullets... are a match.

29:35.909 --> 29:38.811
Two murders
that many years apart?

29:38.812 --> 29:40.846
Anything on the mystery woman?

29:40.847 --> 29:43.716
Mnh-mnh.
Still haven't I.D.'ed her.

29:43.717 --> 29:45.517
You know, Crow would've been
2 years old

29:45.518 --> 29:47.086
when that woman was killed.

29:47.087 --> 29:49.989
Do you remember anything
from when you were that young?

29:49.990 --> 29:51.690
Beckett.

29:51.691 --> 29:53.158
Crow's portfolio?

29:53.159 --> 29:54.693
Yeah.

29:54.694 --> 29:57.896
And there's something
you gotta see.

29:57.897 --> 30:00.666
(Ryan) look familiar?

30:05.404 --> 30:07.405
(Beckett) it's the same tree,

30:07.406 --> 30:09.441
just like where the body was found.

30:09.442 --> 30:11.610
You don't draw something with
that precision from a dream.

30:11.611 --> 30:13.879
He's remembering it.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.782
Crow witnessed that woman's
murder when he was 2 years old.

30:16.783 --> 30:19.118
He had to have been
with someone--a sitter

30:19.119 --> 30:21.586
or a family member
or maybe even the killer.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.588
Run a background check
on the Freemans.

30:23.589 --> 30:25.791
Find out where they were living
18 years ago.
You got it.

30:27.861 --> 30:31.063
Hey, Castle.
Alexis okay?

30:31.064 --> 30:34.199
She's, uh...
She's a smart kid.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.301
You took care of Feggin.

30:36.302 --> 30:39.437
Yeah, well, he was... easy.

30:39.438 --> 30:42.340
He didn't even fuss
when I put him to bed.

30:42.341 --> 30:46.378
Yo. Ready for more tales
of the weird and strangely odd?

30:46.379 --> 30:48.446
We looked into
the Freeman family history.

30:48.447 --> 30:50.549
Freeman is Janice's maiden name.

30:50.550 --> 30:52.851
When she and Alan got married,
Alan took her name

30:52.852 --> 30:54.753
and so did Matthew.

30:54.754 --> 30:57.355
Well, he's either a feminist
or he's hiding something.

30:57.356 --> 31:01.226
What's Alan's original last name?
McGinty. And I think
he was hiding something.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.328
Alan's first wife, Elizabeth McGinty,

31:03.329 --> 31:05.164
went missing from
Summit, New Jersey,

31:05.165 --> 31:06.899
18 years ago.

31:06.900 --> 31:08.667
She was never found.

31:08.668 --> 31:10.769
Alan lied to us.

31:10.770 --> 31:12.805
He knew exactly
who his son was drawing.

31:12.806 --> 31:15.774
He was drawing
his real mother.

31:15.775 --> 31:18.543
And Summit's only a couple of hours
from where the body was found.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.879
Elizabeth McGinty, maiden name Dryden.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.981
Dryden?

31:22.982 --> 31:24.649
Elizabeth Dryden.

31:24.650 --> 31:27.119
What?
Question mark.

31:27.120 --> 31:29.654
Remember what I told you about
gravestones telling stories?

31:29.655 --> 31:32.457
(Beckett) Crow came here
for a reason.

31:32.458 --> 31:35.194
So cemetery management
said that the family

31:35.195 --> 31:37.162
had a memorial service
for their daughter

31:37.163 --> 31:39.598
about five years after she went missing.
Daemon must have looked

31:39.599 --> 31:42.567
at hundreds of reconstructed
faces researching his thesis.

31:42.568 --> 31:45.503
I can't imagine the shock
when he recognized one

31:45.504 --> 31:48.006
as the woman from Crow's drawings.
And Crow must have realized

31:48.007 --> 31:50.675
his family had been
lying to him all these years.

31:50.676 --> 31:53.178
(Beckett) Huh.
Fresh flowers on her grave.

31:53.179 --> 31:55.147
Crow brought
his father here

31:55.148 --> 31:57.382
to confront him
with his mother's grave.

32:01.329 --> 32:02.595
All of these years,

32:02.596 --> 32:04.630
You knew your son
was drawing his mother,

32:04.631 --> 32:07.267
and you never said anything.
I was protecting my family.

32:07.268 --> 32:10.103
You were protecting yourself.
You're a cold-blooded killer.

32:10.104 --> 32:12.705
You killed your wife, and then
reported her missing,

32:12.706 --> 32:15.141
and then 18 years later
when your son found out,

32:15.142 --> 32:18.378
you killed him as well.
You don't have to respond to that.

32:18.379 --> 32:21.581
No, no, no, no. She's accusing
me of killing my son.

32:21.582 --> 32:24.717
Yes, I lied to Matthew,
but I did it to protect him.

32:24.718 --> 32:27.354
I thought he was too young to understand.
You were a suspect.

32:27.355 --> 32:29.589
Of course I was a suspect.
I was her husband.

32:29.590 --> 32:32.658
There wasn't any evidence that
tied me to her disappearance

32:32.659 --> 32:35.362
'cause I had
nothing to do with it.

32:35.363 --> 32:39.165
When Janice and I got married,
it was like a chance...

32:39.166 --> 32:41.368
A chance at a fresh start.

32:41.369 --> 32:43.669
And so as soon
as you were legally able,

32:43.670 --> 32:46.572
you married your nanny.

32:46.573 --> 32:48.674
Janice was there for us

32:48.675 --> 32:51.477
during a very dark time
in our lives.

32:51.478 --> 32:53.346
We had press on the lawn.

32:53.347 --> 32:55.382
There were days without sleep.

32:55.383 --> 32:58.385
I was handing out flyers
with Lizzy's picture on it.

32:58.386 --> 33:01.621
And Janice kept it together,
and she protected Matthew.

33:01.622 --> 33:05.191
Then why would you lie to us?
You told us in front of our daughter.

33:05.192 --> 33:06.826
What did you want me to do,

33:06.827 --> 33:09.195
tell her that everything
she thought was a lie?

33:09.196 --> 33:12.498
Rosie adored Matthew.
She had just found out he died.

33:12.499 --> 33:15.001
What would you have done?

33:15.002 --> 33:17.037
I would've told her
the truth.

33:19.706 --> 33:23.009
He was 9 years old
when he first drew her face.

33:24.946 --> 33:28.014
He showed it to me.
I thought I was seeing a ghost.

33:28.015 --> 33:31.184
I figured... She was still
somewhere in his head

33:31.185 --> 33:34.454
from his early memories.

33:34.455 --> 33:37.390
But we'd been living a lie
for so long,

33:37.391 --> 33:39.659
it had become the truth.

33:39.660 --> 33:42.862
So how could I possibly tell him
that Janice wasn't his mother,

33:42.863 --> 33:45.698
that his real mother ran away?

33:45.699 --> 33:48.668
Are we through here, Detective?
Not by a long shot, Lawson.

33:48.669 --> 33:50.636
The Connecticut state police

33:50.637 --> 33:52.705
found a 9-millimeter handgun
in your client's home,

33:52.706 --> 33:55.675
and I am just betting that
that is the same gun that killed

33:55.676 --> 33:57.677
Elizabeth Dryden McGinty
and Jonas Westfall.

33:57.678 --> 34:00.780
No, I-- don't say anything, Alan.

34:00.781 --> 34:03.416
Oh, yeah.
And there's also this.

34:03.417 --> 34:07.454
Your son witnessed
his mother's murder.

34:15.795 --> 34:17.663
No.

34:17.664 --> 34:21.967
That's not possible.

34:23.437 --> 34:27.706
How... How is this possible?

34:27.708 --> 34:29.208
Here. Thank you.

34:29.210 --> 34:31.444
Ahem. Excuse me.

34:31.445 --> 34:34.414
Um, how much longer are
you people gonna keep us waiting

34:34.415 --> 34:36.549
without letting us know
what is going on?

34:36.550 --> 34:39.784
We are trying to find
the answers, Mrs. Freeman.

34:39.786 --> 34:42.255
(scoffs)

34:47.628 --> 34:49.996
Spots.
What?

34:49.996 --> 34:51.998
"Spots all over.
Blood all over.

34:51.998 --> 34:54.667
I should've buried you then,
you wicked boy."
What are you talking about?

34:54.668 --> 34:56.202
Morlock's crazy talk.

34:56.203 --> 34:57.937
It's just like
Paige's drunk talk.

34:57.938 --> 34:59.906
You have to translate it.

34:59.907 --> 35:02.175
Is Morlock still in holding?
Yeah.

35:02.176 --> 35:04.710
Mrs. Freeman, I am so sorry
this is taking so long.

35:04.711 --> 35:06.712
But as long
as you have to wait,

35:06.713 --> 35:08.714
you might as well
be comfortable.

35:08.715 --> 35:10.716
have you seen
our vending machines?

35:10.717 --> 35:13.553
Uh, straight through here.
Right. Just to the left here.

35:13.554 --> 35:16.589
Perfect. Right in there.
Excellent. Straight through.

35:16.590 --> 35:20.560
Oh, wrong turn--
Aah! Heartless bitch!
Spots murdered the Crow!

35:20.561 --> 35:22.062
Murderer! Murderer!

35:22.063 --> 35:24.464
What a small world.
(sobs)

35:24.465 --> 35:26.832
(groans and whimpers)

35:26.833 --> 35:28.234
(Beckett) Here you go.

35:28.235 --> 35:29.869
Thank you.

35:34.542 --> 35:35.808
Why?

35:35.809 --> 35:37.810
She killed Elizabeth

35:37.811 --> 35:39.679
so that she could have you
to herself.

35:39.680 --> 35:42.549
And then she murdered Matthew
and his friend Daemon

35:42.550 --> 35:44.884
so that you would never find out.

35:44.885 --> 35:46.919
Matthew didn't know
who to trust,

35:46.920 --> 35:48.854
so he asked Daemon
to hide the evidence,

35:48.855 --> 35:51.524
which ended up being smarter
than he ever realized.

35:51.525 --> 35:54.360
She knew that it was only
a matter of time

35:54.361 --> 35:55.995
before they figured out
the truth

35:55.996 --> 35:57.930
about what she had done.

35:57.931 --> 36:01.000
So she followed Daemon
to his apartment and shot him.

36:01.001 --> 36:04.604
She used the same gun that she
used to kill your first wife.

36:04.605 --> 36:06.806
What about my son?

36:06.807 --> 36:08.741
(clears throat)

36:08.742 --> 36:10.977
He was on his way
to the cemetery

36:10.978 --> 36:16.082
to, uh... lay down flowers
at his mother's grave.

36:16.083 --> 36:18.684
And when she saw the stakes
in Daemon's apartment,

36:18.685 --> 36:21.454
she figured
that she could lay blame

36:21.455 --> 36:25.258
on the people in your son's life
that you already hated.

36:25.259 --> 36:28.194
(voice breaking)
She raised him.

36:28.195 --> 36:31.631
She was like his mother.

36:33.800 --> 36:37.737
He was a constant reminder
of what she had done.

36:37.738 --> 36:39.839
And when he turned on her...

36:39.840 --> 36:42.375
she wasn't his mother anymore.

36:42.376 --> 36:45.345
(crying)

36:50.684 --> 36:53.052
Daddy!
Oh, sweetie.

36:53.053 --> 36:54.521
Oh.

36:54.522 --> 36:56.156
It's--it's okay.

36:56.157 --> 36:59.125
(Rosie crying)

36:59.126 --> 37:01.661
It's gonna be fine.
It's okay.

37:01.662 --> 37:05.165
We're gonna be fine, sweetheart.
Everything's gonna be okay.

37:05.166 --> 37:08.268
I hope this doesn't destroy her.
It will for a little while.

37:08.269 --> 37:10.270
And then one day,
she'll wake up,

37:10.271 --> 37:12.205
and it'll just be
a part of her life.

37:12.206 --> 37:14.474
Who knows? Maybe she'll
become a writer.

37:14.475 --> 37:16.309
Or a cop.

37:17.844 --> 37:19.845
You know,
you still haven't told me

37:19.846 --> 37:23.216
where your fascination
with murder came from.

37:24.951 --> 37:28.721
I was 5 years old. We were
summering in the Hamptons.

37:28.722 --> 37:32.058
I was pretty much
left to my own devices.

37:32.059 --> 37:33.259
Mm-hmm.

37:33.260 --> 37:35.662
This one day, I was walking
along the beach.

37:35.663 --> 37:38.731
I was miles
from where I had started.

37:38.732 --> 37:41.067
I was just about to turn back

37:41.068 --> 37:44.003
when I saw something
had washed up on the beach.

37:44.004 --> 37:46.472
I thought,
maybe it's a-a whale

37:46.473 --> 37:48.741
or a turtle or a sea lion.

37:48.742 --> 37:50.910
So I ran over
to see what it was.

37:50.911 --> 37:52.645
What was it?

37:55.481 --> 37:59.017
It was a boy... My age.

37:59.018 --> 38:01.753
It was our housekeeper's son.

38:01.754 --> 38:06.925
It must have just happened...

38:06.926 --> 38:09.361
'cause the tide
hadn't washed away the blood.

38:11.130 --> 38:14.733
We had just played
hide and go seek the day before.

38:14.734 --> 38:17.636
What happened to him?

38:19.472 --> 38:21.340
They never found out.

38:23.343 --> 38:26.010
I'm so sorry, Castle.

38:30.550 --> 38:33.118
You made that up?

38:33.119 --> 38:37.021
(laughs) It's what I do!
You know what? You are
so getting it for that one.

38:37.022 --> 38:39.023
The party is at 9:00.

38:39.024 --> 38:42.127
I cannot wait to see
what you're wearing.

38:47.567 --> 38:50.502
(man) Ã¢ÂÂª Small hands Ã¢ÂÂª

38:50.503 --> 38:53.572
Hey. You're...
You're not in your costume.

38:53.573 --> 38:55.507
(voice breaking)
I'm gonna stay upstairs.

38:55.508 --> 38:58.176
Not really in a party mood.

38:58.177 --> 39:00.746
Ã¢ÂÂª Such a thing is forever Ã¢ÂÂª

39:00.747 --> 39:02.213
What's wrong?

39:02.214 --> 39:04.449
Ã¢ÂÂª

39:04.450 --> 39:06.451
Paige was so angry with me,

39:06.452 --> 39:08.320
she sabotaged
our science project.

39:08.321 --> 39:10.822
She killed Feggin.

39:10.823 --> 39:13.725
She said it was an accident,
but I know she did it on purpose

39:13.726 --> 39:15.794
to get back at me.

39:15.795 --> 39:18.897
Oh, that is so wrong
on so many levels.

39:18.898 --> 39:21.833
How could she take care of him
the way we did

39:21.834 --> 39:24.068
and then just destroy him?

39:24.069 --> 39:26.070
I don't know.
I think that's...

39:26.071 --> 39:28.840
That's one reason
why I write about it.

39:28.841 --> 39:33.345
The way some people behave
just... bewilders me.

39:33.346 --> 39:35.580
I'll tell you this, though.

39:35.581 --> 39:38.817
There is nothing you could do
that would stop me

39:38.818 --> 39:42.287
from protecting you
or supporting you.

39:42.288 --> 39:44.790
Even if I get
a "D" in science?

39:44.791 --> 39:47.426
Even if you get an "F."

39:47.427 --> 39:48.694
(sniffles)

39:48.695 --> 39:51.296
Now... go get changed.

39:51.297 --> 39:53.198
(dramatic voice)
The goblins and ghouls

39:53.199 --> 39:54.866
shall be arriving soon.

39:54.867 --> 39:57.436
(normal voice) You got a spider on you.
Aah!

39:57.437 --> 39:59.571
(woman) Ã¢ÂÂª come on Ã¢ÂÂª

39:59.572 --> 40:01.306
Ã¢ÂÂª oh Ã¢ÂÂª

40:01.307 --> 40:06.144
Ã¢ÂÂª you know that you
want it now, come on Ã¢ÂÂª

40:06.145 --> 40:09.147
Careful. That is a potion
of my own concoction.

40:09.148 --> 40:12.116
Drink it, and who knows
who or what you might become.

40:12.117 --> 40:14.919
Also, you might wonder
what happened to your pants.

40:14.920 --> 40:16.921
Ooh. Sounds like
my kind of party. (laughs)

40:16.922 --> 40:18.923
(chuckles) You throw a great shindig

40:18.924 --> 40:22.461
For a 19th-century poet, Mr. Poe.
(Martha) well, I've always told him,

40:22.462 --> 40:24.429
"Darling, if you're gonna do something,

40:24.430 --> 40:27.432
do it big or don't do it at all."
is that why you chose that hat?

40:27.433 --> 40:29.735
Oh, really.

40:29.736 --> 40:32.738
Hey, Castle. Who you
lookin' for--Beckett?

40:32.739 --> 40:35.574
No. Why?
(mouth full) She said
she wasn't sure she'd make it.

40:35.575 --> 40:37.976
She had some paperwork
to finish up.

40:37.977 --> 40:39.644
But it's still early.
Hmm.

40:39.645 --> 40:42.681
Hey, Poe. Looking for me?

40:42.682 --> 40:44.115
You're you.

40:44.116 --> 40:46.284
You sound
so disappointed, Castle.

40:46.285 --> 40:48.887
I said costumes mandatory.
I mean, dress up.

40:48.888 --> 40:51.556
You know, be a little scary.

40:51.557 --> 40:53.759
Yeah, well, I was going for sexy.

40:53.760 --> 40:56.895
Ã¢ÂÂª

40:59.399 --> 41:00.632
Jeez!
Ooh.

41:00.633 --> 41:02.300
Now we're even.

41:02.301 --> 41:04.168
