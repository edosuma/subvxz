tied up right now.

just a little late?

12:59.533 --> 13:02.400
You must really love jail.

13:31.500 --> 13:34.500
You might not want to tell your
momma about this part.

13:42.900 --> 13:45.833
Is that guy... dead?

13:47.067 --> 13:50.733

There he is! My money-maker!

13:55.100 --> 13:56.967
Did you book me a funeral?

13:57.067 --> 14:00.767
No! Of course not!

14:00.867 --> 14:02.867
A funeral, that's about death.

14:02.967 --> 14:06.300
This is a biker wake.
It's a "Celebration of Life!"

14:06.400 --> 14:08.833
You, my friend, are set
to make a pretty penny here.

14:08.933 --> 14:10.733
What the hell am I doing
in this joint?

14:10.833 --> 14:14.467
Oh, c'mon, Vernon! What, do you
really want to deny Spider...

14:14.567 --> 14:17.233
his last, final, dying wish?

14:17.333 --> 14:22.067
Plus, I brought you a surprise!

14:23.067 --> 14:24.567
You take that off the king
himself?

14:24.667 --> 14:27.067
Naw, let's just say I borrowed
it off a mannequin...

14:27.133 --> 14:28.600

14:28.700 --> 14:30.533

Let's go get you suited up,
Vernon.

14:40.067 --> 14:42.500
Say, is there any chance I could
get my cut up front?

14:42.600 --> 14:44.200
Hey, I gotta go to work now.

14:44.300 --> 14:49.067
So I'm gonna set you right here

14:49.167 --> 14:52.233

something?

Vernon possibly know...

15:05.167 --> 15:07.267
about being a father, anyway?
