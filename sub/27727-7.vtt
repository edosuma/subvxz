00:06.520 --> 00:08.520
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLASTS)

00:54.040 --> 00:56.040
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:58.840 --> 01:00.280
Hello!

01:00.320 --> 01:02.320
Hello, everybody!

01:02.360 --> 01:04.360
Hel-lo!

01:06.440 --> 01:08.440
Thank you so much.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.480
Thank you, everybody.

01:10.520 --> 01:11.880
Wow!

01:11.920 --> 01:13.440
Noisy bunch.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.400
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you, thank you,
and welcome.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.080
And in this week's show:

01:22.760 --> 01:24.160
Loch...

01:24.200 --> 01:25.640
Scot...

01:26.800 --> 01:28.800
...and two smoking Beamers.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.480
(CHEERING AND WHOOPING)

01:35.480 --> 01:36.840
Now...

01:36.880 --> 01:38.880
Thanks, everybody,
thank you, thank you.

01:38.920 --> 01:40.920
Now, I wanna begin
by talking about money.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.760
Bear with us on this one.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.880
You see,
if you'd put £35,000

01:45.920 --> 01:48.280
in a saving account
in the year 2000,

01:48.320 --> 01:51.000
you'd now have
around £60,000.

01:51.040 --> 01:55.200
However, if you'd put
that same £35,000

01:55.240 --> 01:57.240
into an E-Type Jaguar,

01:57.280 --> 02:00.120
you'd now have £100,000.

02:00.160 --> 02:03.720
Yeah, just about everything
even remotely rare
or interesting

02:03.760 --> 02:05.760
is worth a fortune
these days.

02:05.800 --> 02:10.320
Aston Martin DB5,
that'll cost you £750,000.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.960
Ferrari Daytona, £600,000.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.600
A pagoda roof Mercedes SL,
that'll set you back
at least 75 grand now.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.160
Yeah, it's not just
exotic cars either.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.160
Ford Escort Mexico, OK?
A hum-drum car.

02:22.160 --> 02:25.120
That's a £60,000 thing
these days.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.880
-60 grand!
-Yeah, it is.

02:26.960 --> 02:31.120
However, there are one or two
rare and interesting cars

02:31.160 --> 02:33.360
that seem to have
slipped through the net,

02:33.400 --> 02:37.440
whose prices haven't yet
gone through the ceiling.

02:37.440 --> 02:41.040
So we decided
to get out there and see

02:41.080 --> 02:45.320
which of us was best
at spotting that
investment opportunity.

02:45.360 --> 02:48.440
Exactly. So we each
bought a classic car.

02:48.520 --> 02:51.040
And then to see which one
of us had got the best deal,

02:51.080 --> 02:53.240
we took The Grand Tour to
what one of our producers,

02:53.280 --> 02:56.560
who's Scottish,
always says is the best,

02:56.600 --> 02:58.880
most beautiful place
on earth:

02:58.920 --> 03:00.760
Scotland.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.200
We chose,
for our meeting point,

03:10.240 --> 03:12.960
a quaint fishing port
near Inverness.

03:16.440 --> 03:19.240
And I was
the first to arrive,

03:19.280 --> 03:22.040
in an Alfa Romeo GTV6.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.040
Now...

03:26.080 --> 03:28.520
you would imagine
that when one of these

03:28.560 --> 03:31.000
comes onto the market,

03:31.040 --> 03:33.800
classic car enthusiasts
are running around

03:33.840 --> 03:37.880
like they're in a zombie
movie and it's Black Friday.

03:39.240 --> 03:40.720
But, no.

03:40.760 --> 03:45.080
I bought this
from an 83-year-old man...

03:45.120 --> 03:47.280
...who'd had it since new
and was only selling it

03:47.320 --> 03:49.160
cos his 84-year-old wife

03:49.200 --> 03:52.960
found it so difficult to get
in and out of, "you know".

03:53.000 --> 03:55.360
It's only done 26,000 miles.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.120
And yet it cost £10,000.

03:58.160 --> 04:01.240
And £10,000 -
that's a round of drinks

04:01.280 --> 04:03.800
in the world where
this sort of thing belongs.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.920
-(VEHICLE APPROACHING)
-Oh, hello.

04:05.960 --> 04:09.360
James May in
a Lancia Gamma Coupe.

04:09.400 --> 04:13.000
That's one of the prettiest
cars ever made, but don't
tell him I said that.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.520
Morning, May.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.680
-How much?
-£13,500.

04:20.680 --> 04:23.720
Oh, £3,500 more...

04:23.760 --> 04:27.360
...than I paid for this
vastly superior Alfa Romeo.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.240
Well, £13,500 is a bargain

04:29.320 --> 04:32.440
for a car that is coach-built
and extremely rare

04:32.480 --> 04:34.080
and beautiful.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.600
But it isn't exotic
like this is.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.640
What do you mean,
it's not exotic?

04:37.680 --> 04:40.920
May I just talk you through
some of this car's
features, yes?

04:40.920 --> 04:42.320
Transaxle,
gearbox at the back,

04:42.360 --> 04:47.360
twin-plate clutch,
disks all round,
unusual at the time.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.800
One of the best engines
ever made,
two-and-a-half litre V6.

04:49.880 --> 04:54.240
Those aren't my words, by the
way, they are the words of
James May in Car Magazine.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.920
-Yes, I did say that. I do.
-You love this engine.

04:56.920 --> 05:00.160
And this has won the European
Touring Car Championship

05:00.200 --> 05:03.000
four years on the trot,
it won the British Touring
Car Championship.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.560
This has got
race breeding as well.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.680
-What, the Gamma?
-It's a Lancia!

05:06.720 --> 05:09.800
They're the most successful
rallying team in history.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.560
Not my words,
the words of Jeremy Clarkson.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.600
And that is
a better-looking car.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.320
-What, than this?
-Yes!

05:16.360 --> 05:19.240
-It is...
(IN FRENCH ACCENT) superbe.
-It's not "superbe".

05:19.320 --> 05:20.920
I tell you what's not superb.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.880
Richard Hammond
arriving in a Fiat X19.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.160
How much?

05:28.240 --> 05:30.880
£2,250.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.040
Somebody saw you coming,
Hammond.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.080
What? For a baby Ferrari,
two thousand...

05:36.120 --> 05:38.600
-Did you just call it
a baby Ferrari?
-He did.

05:38.640 --> 05:41.280
RICHARD: Because it is.
Mid-engined, Italian,
it's exactly what it is.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.320
-Ooh, listen to that sound.
-I know.

05:43.360 --> 05:47.920
That is the reassuring sound
of tin on Russian steel.

05:47.960 --> 05:51.880
It's a light, bright,
effervescent sound,
just like the car.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.160
JEREMY: How many colours
has this car been?

05:54.200 --> 05:56.160
It was black,
then it was red,

05:56.200 --> 05:58.880
then it was white,
then it was pale blue,
and now it's purple.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.200
I'd like to add, actually,

06:00.240 --> 06:02.560
it's not, "How many colours
has this car been?"

06:02.600 --> 06:05.080
-How many cars has this been?
-Well, quite.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.120
JEREMY: It's now going brown.
JAMES: Brown, yeah.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.160
All right, then.
I'm not gonna turn around.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.840
I'll try and work out
which Alfa you've bought.

06:11.880 --> 06:14.960
-Da-nah, the best Alfa.
-(LAUGHS) Oh, it's a GTV6.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.680
-Exactly!
-Yeah.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.400
Why has it got this
plastic bit in the middle
of the bonnet?

06:19.440 --> 06:22.880
Genius. The engine in
this car had a small issue.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.040
it used to backf-...
well, front-fire, actually,

06:25.080 --> 06:28.040
and blow the top
off the engine, yeah?

06:28.080 --> 06:29.800
So that would damage
the bonnet.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.920
So they put this plastic
panel, which was easier
to replace.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.400
Why didn't they stop it
backfiring?

06:34.440 --> 06:36.080
JAMES:
Oh, don't be ridiculous!

06:36.120 --> 06:38.120
-They were...busy.
-Lazy.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.600
-Can I just ask?
-Hmm?

06:39.640 --> 06:41.520
What's that broom handle
thing for?

06:41.560 --> 06:45.040
Well, now this is another
characteristic of the GTV6

06:45.080 --> 06:48.200
is that when you park up, you
need to keep the clutch pedal

06:48.240 --> 06:50.920
depressed using
a broom handle like that.

06:50.960 --> 06:53.600
-Right.
-Otherwise the clutch
and the flywheel

06:53.640 --> 06:55.680
-will fuse together.
-JAMES: I see.

06:55.720 --> 06:58.760
I used to own one of these,
there's not a lot
I don't know about it.

06:58.800 --> 07:02.640
RICHARD: Yeah. When you used
to own one of these, how did
you find the gear change?

07:02.680 --> 07:04.560
JEREMY: Um...smooth, snicky.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.120
-No, it wasn't, was it?
-No, those aren't quite
the right words.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.120
Terrible.
What about second?

07:09.160 --> 07:11.000
Yeah, second...

07:11.040 --> 07:13.240
-I don't know,
I never found it.
-No, exactly!

07:13.280 --> 07:18.280
Yes, let's not get bogged
down with some of the Alfa's
minor design flaws.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.440
Disasters.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.200
Because all three of us
have got classic cars.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.000
-I have, yes.
-For good money.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.040
-Mm-hmm.
-We're in Scotland.

07:26.080 --> 07:28.400
So why don't we take them
on a drive in...

07:28.440 --> 07:31.240
Well, let's be honest,
Scotland is just a road trip.

07:31.280 --> 07:35.000
JAMES: I agree.
-We could, while we're here,
we could do the NC500.

07:36.160 --> 07:38.160
Which, I mean, that is sup...

07:38.200 --> 07:39.920
Voted by Condé Nast
Traveller magazine...

07:39.960 --> 07:43.120
voted it the best road trip
in the world.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.080
RICHARD: It's got lochs,
mountains, it's just--

07:45.120 --> 07:46.960
All the pretty bits, yeah.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.560
It's all the best bits of
Scotland, right,

07:48.600 --> 07:50.600
500 miles round
the north coast of Scotland.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.200
-In Italian exotic cars.
-(MESSAGE ALERT)

07:52.240 --> 07:54.320
-Oh, hang on. Text.
-What?

07:54.360 --> 07:56.440
Yeah? Mr Wilman.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.480
Mr Wilman. (SNIFFS)

07:59.200 --> 08:00.760
It says:

08:00.800 --> 08:05.040
"Those cars will not do 500
yards, leave alone 500 miles.

08:05.080 --> 08:08.160
So I've provided three backup
vehicles which you can use

08:08.200 --> 08:10.600
to get home when they go
wrong and catch fire.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.640
And explode."

08:14.920 --> 08:17.160
-I was wondering
what they were.
JAMES: Funny.

08:17.200 --> 08:20.880
How did he know we were
going to do 500 miles?

08:20.920 --> 08:23.960
That's a good point,
actually, cos Hammond's
only just suggested it.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.160
-How did he know that?
JEREMY: How did he get
three bicycles...

08:28.200 --> 08:31.440
Putting Mr Wilman's
psychic powers to one side,

08:31.480 --> 08:32.680
we climbed aboard...

08:32.720 --> 08:35.280
(ENGINE REVS)

08:35.320 --> 08:38.360
...and set off
into the giant oil painting

08:38.400 --> 08:40.400
that is Scotland.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.440
Oh.

08:58.760 --> 09:03.040
This isn't exactly like
the tourist authority would
have you believe, is it?

09:03.080 --> 09:05.000
RICHARD:
It doesn't look like it looks

09:05.040 --> 09:07.880
on the shortbread tins.

09:07.960 --> 09:12.480
This render that they put on
everything is like a sort of
batter for houses, isn't it?

09:12.520 --> 09:15.480
Batter! (LAUGHS)

09:15.520 --> 09:18.520
(SCOTTISH ACCENT)
"I've battered my house."

09:18.600 --> 09:22.360
You can see why they want
to be independent, can't you?
Get away from us lot.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.760
Well, you wouldn't want
people coming in and messing
all this up, would you?

09:25.760 --> 09:30.880
I used to have a fiercely
Scottish neighbour in London.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.520
JEREMY: Why would a Scottish
person go and live in London?

09:33.600 --> 09:35.600
I dunno, because he'd
do anything for Scotland.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.200
Well, except live there.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.840
Was he called Sean Connery?

09:38.880 --> 09:41.760
(CHUCKLES)

09:41.840 --> 09:44.000
JEREMY: Eventually,
we cleared the fishing port

09:44.040 --> 09:47.200
and found ourselves
on the open road,

09:47.240 --> 09:48.880
where we could get
down to the business

09:48.960 --> 09:52.440
of enjoying our
pedigree Italian classics.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.040
And the Fiat.

09:56.880 --> 10:01.360
JAMES: My car is just so
refined and sophisticated.

10:01.400 --> 10:05.240
And in fact, really
well looked after
by its previous owner.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.840
It was obviously loved and...

10:09.880 --> 10:11.880
One of my windscreen wipers
just fell off.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.880
(GIGGLES)

10:15.880 --> 10:17.440
Oh, dear!

10:17.480 --> 10:20.240
(LAUGHS)

10:20.280 --> 10:22.360
-He can't get out.
-I can't get out.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.600
We can only just lift it up,
there you go.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.360
You just have to
drive like that.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.400
James, can I just say,
you've done three miles.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.840
There, it's mended for now.
Don't turn it on again.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.360
-Just turn it on, I want to
see what happens.
-OK.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.960
-Ready?
-(SCRAPING)

10:37.000 --> 10:38.360
(BOTH GIGGLE UNCONTROLLABLY)

10:38.400 --> 10:40.400
In Scotland?

10:40.440 --> 10:42.640
-In Scotland, you won't
need it, that's the thing.
-Perfect.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.000
Cos it never rains.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.640
(HORN BLARES)

10:53.640 --> 10:55.880
Right, now we're alone,
viewers,

10:55.960 --> 10:59.640
I can reveal that that
windscreen wiper incident
is really a bit of an aside

10:59.720 --> 11:02.280
compared with some of the
other problems this car has.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.800
Most of these
relate to the engine.

11:04.840 --> 11:07.040
In particular,
the way Lancia mounted

11:07.080 --> 11:12.400
the power steering pump
on the end of one of
the cam shafts.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.320
Basically, you can't
really use full lock,

11:15.360 --> 11:18.800
especially when
the engine's cold, otherwise
the engine will explode.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.640
The thermostat was fitted
in the wrong place,

11:20.680 --> 11:23.200
which leads to overheating,
very suddenly

11:23.240 --> 11:24.840
and then the engine
can explode.

11:24.880 --> 11:27.200
And there were some problems
with the gasket materials,

11:27.240 --> 11:29.520
which causes the coolant
to mix with the oil

11:29.560 --> 11:32.560
with engine-exploding
sort of results, really.

11:34.320 --> 11:38.040
RICHARD: James, I heard
Wednesdays can cause
your car to explode.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.280
So you need to be
careful tomorrow.

11:40.320 --> 11:43.800
JEREMY: Proximity to trees,
lakes, grass,

11:43.840 --> 11:46.280
heather, grouse, or tartan.

11:46.320 --> 11:49.440
All those things cause it
to explode, I'm sure.

11:49.480 --> 11:52.400
Look, I'm sitting here trying
to explain to the viewers

11:52.440 --> 11:54.960
why the engine might explode
and I'm constantly

11:55.000 --> 11:57.440
interrupted with your stupid
exploding engine jokes.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.600
OK, carry on,
but do it quickly
before the engine explodes.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.360
JEREMY:
Meanwhile, in the GTV6...

12:04.400 --> 12:07.160
-(GRINDING)
-Ooh, no, what's that?

12:07.200 --> 12:09.600
That third?
Right, good, third.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.040
(GRINDING)

12:13.080 --> 12:14.840
Fourth? Yeah, fourth.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.880
Or is it fourth or second?

12:17.920 --> 12:23.240
I was getting reacquainted
with all the peculiar
little foibles.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.280
Driving position's
not brilliant.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.960
Pedals are far too close
to the seat,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.400
so you have to drive with
your legs wide apart.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.440
Not so bad if you're a man.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.120
If you're a girl, though,

12:35.160 --> 12:38.760
trousers is a strategy
you need to think about
in a morning.

12:40.240 --> 12:42.520
However,
despite all the weirdness,

12:42.560 --> 12:45.880
I do still absolutely love
this thing.

12:47.760 --> 12:50.840
It was my ownership of a GTV6

12:50.880 --> 12:53.360
that taught me
what cars are all about.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.840
You need a personality,

12:55.880 --> 12:59.520
you need flaws
for them to be human.

12:59.560 --> 13:02.360
And James May was right
for the first time
in his life,

13:02.400 --> 13:04.600
and only time in his life:

13:04.640 --> 13:08.160
this is one of the greatest
engines ever made.

13:08.200 --> 13:11.480
The creamiest,
the smoothest...

13:11.520 --> 13:13.320
...and the most beautiful
to listen to.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.360
(ENGINE REVS)

13:17.280 --> 13:19.280
That's not exhaust noise.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.800
That's an actual engine.

13:22.840 --> 13:26.200
As James and I enjoyed
our classic thoroughbreds,

13:26.240 --> 13:29.040
Richard was driving along
in his purple Fiat.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.760
Unleash 80 horsepower.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.200
(LAUGHS)

13:37.480 --> 13:41.400
Well, I mean, this thing
only weighs 960 kilos.

13:43.040 --> 13:46.040
Fiat sold 170,000 X19s,

13:46.080 --> 13:48.560
so this doesn't have rarity
like theirs does.

13:48.600 --> 13:54.920
But let's contrast rarity
with the opposite,
which is popularity.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.720
Cos that's what this car was,
immensely popular.

13:59.240 --> 14:02.080
And I have
the pop-up head lamps.

14:02.120 --> 14:05.040
Oh, yeah!

14:05.080 --> 14:06.480
I'm gonna pop them down
again now.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.520
(WHIRRING)

14:08.560 --> 14:10.560
(LAUGHS)
I can do that
whenever I want!

14:12.360 --> 14:14.360
One slight complaint
about the Fiat,

14:14.400 --> 14:18.240
the pedals are very,
very small and
very close together.

14:18.280 --> 14:21.880
And if you try and
operate them with,
let's say, your feet,

14:21.920 --> 14:25.080
you'll find that
your feet are too big.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.520
Really, you just need
to use a toe on each.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.400
JEREMY: Soon,
Hammond spotted a racetrack

14:35.440 --> 14:37.840
and suggested
we have a go on it.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.960
And as we pulled up,
it became clear

14:42.000 --> 14:45.520
that tiny pedals
weren't his only problem.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.720
(ENGINE REVVING)

14:55.760 --> 14:58.160
JEREMY:
That's quite high revs.
-Yeah, it idles quite high.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.400
-Is that its idle speed?
-Yes.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.160
It's keen!

15:04.720 --> 15:07.760
RICHARD: Since this was
actually a go-cart track,

15:07.800 --> 15:10.360
it was too narrow
for car racing.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.800
So I decided we should have
a drifting competition.

15:19.320 --> 15:20.880
Come on, little Fiat.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.080
It doesn't work.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.120
(TYRES SCREECHING)

15:29.160 --> 15:32.280
It simply doesn't really
have the power to...

15:33.520 --> 15:35.520
...throw its tail out
properly.

15:38.760 --> 15:42.120
JEREMY: Even though my Alfa
had twice the horsepower
of the Fiat,

15:42.160 --> 15:44.160
things weren't great
for me either.

15:45.880 --> 15:49.840
You can't unstick
the tail of a GTV6.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.920
You just can't. Ready?

15:52.920 --> 15:54.920
Just grip and more grip.

15:58.320 --> 16:04.080
I know Roger Moore drifted
a GTV6 in Octopussy.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.080
But then he crashed
into a fence

16:06.120 --> 16:07.880
and had to dress up
as a clown.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.480
JAMES: In the Gamma,
I was confident

16:13.520 --> 16:16.360
I'd succeed where
my colleagues had failed.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.440
Right, here we go.

16:19.480 --> 16:21.960
Lancia is one of the greatest
names in rallying history,

16:22.000 --> 16:26.200
so a controlled drift should
be second nature to this.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.880
As I approach that corner,
I'll heel and toe it and...

16:33.200 --> 16:34.240
Hm.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.840
Brake, lift-off.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.600
Nope.

16:42.640 --> 16:46.080
At this point,
I suddenly remembered
something important.

16:46.120 --> 16:47.600
This is front-wheel drive,
isn't it?

16:47.640 --> 16:49.640
What was I thinking of?

16:49.680 --> 16:53.480
It's not gonna drift.

16:53.520 --> 16:59.160
Happily, though, the
enthralled local audience
were able to find a solution.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.040
What I do is,
I take the rear wheels off,

17:01.080 --> 17:03.840
let the tyres down and put
these plastic covers on.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.560
Then pump the tyres back up
again, put them back on,

17:06.600 --> 17:09.480
that gives the car the loose
back end you want to drift.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.560
These are just...this is like
putting insulating tape

17:11.560 --> 17:14.160
on the back wheels
of your Scalextric cars.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.760
Stand by.

17:17.800 --> 17:21.000
With no help from anyone else
on this freezing day,

17:21.040 --> 17:23.040
the drift covers
were soon fitted.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.000
Oh, here we go.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.000
(RATTLING)

17:32.000 --> 17:33.160
Oh!

17:35.320 --> 17:37.760
Right, turn in...

17:37.800 --> 17:40.080
...get the drift going,
then...

17:40.160 --> 17:42.560
(TYRES SCREECHING)

17:42.560 --> 17:44.560
(LAUGHTER)

17:44.640 --> 17:47.400
JAMES: This entertainment
went on for quite some time.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.880
(LAUGHTER)

18:04.200 --> 18:05.560
No.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.560
Until eventually...

18:08.720 --> 18:12.240
Dab of brakes, in.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.560
RICHARD: Hold it, hold it!
JEREMY: He turned
the steering wheel!

18:14.640 --> 18:17.320
-He turned
the steering wheel!
-He did a thing to it.

18:17.320 --> 18:19.240
Ye-e-es!

18:19.280 --> 18:21.280
RICHARD: Yes, yes, yes.

18:23.480 --> 18:25.440
This looks like a lot of fun.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.240
We're gonna do that.
We've gotta try it.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.280
Oh, no, there's the only set.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.920
-What, of those things?
-Yeah, they're the only set,
so we can't do it.

18:31.960 --> 18:33.320
No, we can...
We can make some.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.320
(ELECTRIC SAW WHIRRING)

18:39.680 --> 18:41.680
Did you ask if you could
borrow this bit?

18:41.720 --> 18:43.280
No, but they won't need it.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.440
-And rotate.
-Aaaah...

18:48.680 --> 18:51.560
This goes over.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.320
It'll require
a little bit of persuasion.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.920
James May just drifted
perfectly behind you.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.960
This is another
of those weird days.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.800
JEREMY:
With his tyre covers made,

19:00.880 --> 19:03.520
Hammond decided
not to hold back.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.080
(RATTLING)

19:12.560 --> 19:14.280
Oh, this is gonna be...

19:14.320 --> 19:17.080

get to that corner, then...

19:17.080 --> 19:18.880
(RATTLING)

19:20.960 --> 19:22.960
Where can
the helicopter land?

19:24.720 --> 19:26.720
Here comes a drift,
here it comes.

19:26.760 --> 19:29.480
And drifting.

-(TYRES SCREECHING)
-Agh!

19:31.560 --> 19:33.520

no, that's fallen off.

didn't stop him

20:01.240 --> 20:04.320
fitting his ridiculous
contraptions
to my precious Alfa.

20:05.720 --> 20:09.280
And insisting
that I have a go.

20:09.320 --> 20:12.320
Think of the trouble
Alfa Romeo went to

20:12.400 --> 20:14.240
to make this car exquisite.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.640
Think of the trouble
that Pirelli went to

20:16.680 --> 20:19.640
to make the tyres
grip properly.

20:19.680 --> 20:22.080
And then along comes
Hammond with a bin.

you blithering idiot,

20:45.200 --> 20:47.200
you've totally ruined
this car!

20:49.280 --> 20:54.480
An inspection of
the undersides
revealed some grim news.

20:54.520 --> 20:57.800
That has come off.
So the prop shaft is now...

20:57.880 --> 20:59.960
Well, it's still
joining the gearbox

21:00.000 --> 21:03.320
or the transaxle to the
engine, but by a thread.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.720
And if I did anything more
that rev it like that,
it's gonna come off.

21:06.760 --> 21:10.080
If I'm driving along, then
that's the end of the Alfa.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.560
Well, that's interesting.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.560

25 miles away.

23:33.440 --> 23:34.760
Come on.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.160
Hammond!

23:36.200 --> 23:37.840
-(LAUGHTER INSIDE)
-Hammond!

23:37.880 --> 23:39.800
-Hammond!
-(LAUGHTER)

23:44.320 --> 23:46.800
JEREMY: The next morning,
the peaceful stillness

23:46.840 --> 23:50.440
was shattered by the cry
of a distressed animal.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.800
RICHARD: Clarkson!

23:54.840 --> 23:56.360
Clarkson!

23:57.360 --> 23:59.360
Where's my roof?

24:03.440 --> 24:04.720
Right.

24:05.720 --> 24:06.880
Bastard!

24:10.200 --> 24:12.400
-(CRUNCHING)
-What was that?

24:12.440 --> 24:14.720
What...Oh, you are joking?

24:15.720 --> 24:17.440
No. No.

24:17.480 --> 24:18.760
No.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.320
He hasn't,
he's not that sick.

24:20.360 --> 24:21.680
-Morning.
-What?

24:21.720 --> 24:24.120
-Morning.
-Yeah, whatever. Oh!

24:25.520 --> 24:27.240
Why have you driven over
your own roof?

24:28.600 --> 24:30.920
Clarkson. He's sick.

24:34.360 --> 24:36.360
Enjoy your day
on your bicycle!

24:36.400 --> 24:38.000
Bastard.

24:47.120 --> 24:49.120
Well, I'm cold now,
obviously.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.440
Borrowed a jacket
from a cameraman.

24:52.480 --> 24:55.000
He's six-three and 18 stone.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.160
I'm in a small, stylish,
Italian sports car,

25:01.200 --> 25:02.720
supposed to be looking good.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.320
I look like
a frostbitten gnome!

25:05.680 --> 25:08.000
JAMES: Rotten trick, that.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.040
I wouldn't stand for it.

25:10.080 --> 25:13.760
The only thing that worries
me is he might get some
exercise on his bicycle!

25:13.800 --> 25:16.120
-Ha-ha-ha!
-Do you think he's already
just become

25:16.160 --> 25:17.920
one of those
embittered cyclists

25:17.960 --> 25:20.000
who hates anybody
who's got a car?

25:20.040 --> 25:22.040
(HORN TOOTING)

25:23.400 --> 25:24.680
Oh, jeez.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.960
-(HORN TOOTING CONTINUOUSLY)
-What?

25:27.000 --> 25:28.360
Oh, come on!

25:29.360 --> 25:30.840
(HORN BLARES)

25:30.880 --> 25:32.320
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

25:35.960 --> 25:37.960
He did not mend that.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

25:48.080 --> 25:49.720
Very good. Now...

25:51.160 --> 25:54.480
I have to say, the only
reason why we met

25:54.520 --> 25:56.920
on a beach full of oil rigs
and then drove

25:56.960 --> 25:59.480
through a council estate
full of hypodermic needles

25:59.520 --> 26:01.120
is to annoy...

26:01.160 --> 26:04.240
Well, simply and only to
annoy our Scottish producer.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.920
Yes, but we will not tell you
Gav's name, we promise.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.960
No, we won't.
We won't say his name.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.360
Anyway, look, it all gets
a lot sunnier and prettier
in part two,

26:12.400 --> 26:15.480
when we finally get
on the North Coast 500

26:15.520 --> 26:17.400
and we'll pick that up
later on.

26:17.440 --> 26:20.720
Yes, but now
it's time to say hello

26:20.760 --> 26:23.320
to the old lady of debate,

26:23.360 --> 26:24.800
who sits
in the bus shelter...

26:26.320 --> 26:30.440
...of chat on
Conversation Street.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.480
(MELLOW JAZZ)

26:32.520 --> 26:34.520
(LAUGHTER)

26:38.280 --> 26:39.960
I don't even remember
that one.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.280
I don't remember
that happening.

26:41.320 --> 26:43.040
I wanna stick with
the film in Scotland,

26:43.080 --> 26:45.640
if I may, James May, because
at one point you said

26:45.680 --> 26:48.560
you put those plastic things
on the back wheels
of your Lancia

26:48.600 --> 26:53.840
because it was like putting
insulating tape on the back
wheels of a Scalextric car.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.560
-Yeah.
-Who's ever done that?

26:55.600 --> 26:57.520
Well, I have.

26:57.560 --> 27:01.160
Yes, but you said it like
it's one of those things
that everybody's done.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.680
-He did.
-It's like saying,

27:02.720 --> 27:05.400
"Oh, remember when you stole
your first pair of tights?"

27:05.440 --> 27:07.480
-(LAUGHTER)
-You know what
it's like, Hammond,

27:07.520 --> 27:08.960
when you've got marmite
on your testicles.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.

27:11.040 --> 27:14.360
Hang on, Scalextric cars
have too much grip.
That's the point.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.280
No, they don't! That's why
they end up under the sofa.

27:16.320 --> 27:19.000
-They haven't got any grip.
-Every corner, they fly off!

27:19.040 --> 27:22.000
They've got too much grip,
they over-steer suddenly
and you can't control it.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.040
If you put the insulating
tape on the rear tyres,

27:24.080 --> 27:26.680
you reduce the grip and then
you can slide them
and drift them--

27:26.720 --> 27:29.400
Oh, my God,
you have actually done this?

27:29.440 --> 27:31.400
Of course
I've bloody done it!

27:31.440 --> 27:32.600
Your childhood!

27:32.640 --> 27:34.400
Who here has put
insulating tape

27:34.440 --> 27:37.320
or any form of tape on the
rear wheels of a Scalextric?

27:37.360 --> 27:39.360
RICHARD:
That's nobody at all.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.240
JEREMY: You?
JAMES: There, there.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.400
How bored must you be
to think,
"I know what I'll do today"?

27:45.840 --> 27:48.240
Everyone apart from
that lady over there

27:48.280 --> 27:50.320
has never put insulating...

27:50.360 --> 27:53.160
It's your worst
explanation ever.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.400
-See me after.
-No, no, it's not. It's not.

27:55.440 --> 27:58.920
His worst explanation ever
was when we were doing
that water speed record.

27:58.960 --> 28:02.080
And he explained to you,
um...to clear things up,

28:02.120 --> 28:05.440
how the boat controls,
which you can operate,

28:05.480 --> 28:07.040
on our Pond Bug,
worked the same way

28:07.080 --> 28:10.720
as aeroplane controls,
which you can't operate.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.920
Exactly.
That is the James May way.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.960
Explaining something
you do understand

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
in a way
that you don't understand.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.160
Look, hang on a minute.
Hold on a minute.

28:19.200 --> 28:22.240
You are a man who can't wind
a wristwatch up without
taking somebody's eye out.

28:22.280 --> 28:24.160
And you claimed in that film

28:24.200 --> 28:26.680
that you'd mended the prop
shaft on that Alfa Romeo.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.040
-I did.
-Did you?

28:28.080 --> 28:30.080
-Well, I made a phone call.
-Did you?

28:30.120 --> 28:31.400
Same thing.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.400
I made a phone call
and a man, unbelievably,

28:33.440 --> 28:36.160
drove all the way from
Wiltshire to Inverness

28:36.200 --> 28:38.200
with the spare part
that I needed.

28:38.240 --> 28:40.160
How generous.
And then you mended it?

28:40.200 --> 28:42.200
-Well, I watched.
-Yeah.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.760
Actually, this is
the part that broke.

28:44.800 --> 28:47.200
You can see the bit
that came out, there, yes?

28:47.240 --> 28:48.360
Mm-hm.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.800
And apparently this is
a known fault on a GTV6.

28:50.840 --> 28:52.960
Everything
is a known fault on...

28:53.000 --> 28:56.320
A GTV6 is a known fault.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.160
Shall we just
move this along?

28:58.200 --> 29:01.880
-Let's move it along to
more actual conversation.
-Mm-hmm.

29:01.920 --> 29:07.280
Land Rover has announced
that 70% of people suffer
from motion sickness.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.960
And they say that in
the future, their cars
will have...

29:10.000 --> 29:13.320
some clever system
that senses when
you're getting carsick

29:13.360 --> 29:15.120
and then adjusts
the cabin temperature

29:15.160 --> 29:17.040
and the suspension to cope.

29:17.080 --> 29:20.280
-And I think
that's a pretty good idea.
-That is quite clever.

29:20.320 --> 29:23.640
I have to say, I've never had
any sort of motion
sickness, anyway.

29:23.680 --> 29:27.040
But I'm very grateful cos
I once met a man
who did have it.

29:27.080 --> 29:29.240
It was on a cross-Channel
ferry, very rough crossing.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.280
Everybody was being sick
except me.

29:31.320 --> 29:33.880
And I went into the lavs
and there was this bloke

29:33.920 --> 29:35.920
and he was face down
on the floor.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.720
On a boat there's
a little lip at the door
to stop water getting out.

29:38.760 --> 29:40.280
And that was all
full of sick.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.960
(AUDIENCE GROANS)

29:42.000 --> 29:44.840
And as the boat rolled,
this little sort of
miniature tsunami...

29:44.880 --> 29:46.080
(AUDIENCE GROANS)

29:46.120 --> 29:49.720
...sort of came
and hit him in the face.

29:49.760 --> 29:53.120
As I walked in, he looked up
at me and he went, "Kill me."

29:53.160 --> 29:54.320
(LAUGHTER)

29:54.360 --> 29:55.920
But the thing that was
disturbing is,

29:55.960 --> 29:58.440
I know he meant it.
He did mean it.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.480
Anyone had sea sickness?
Cos I have.

30:00.520 --> 30:03.440
You do genuinely want
someone to kill you

30:03.480 --> 30:05.240
when you're seasick,
you really do.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.760
You really do.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.360
What also troubled me
about that ship was

30:08.400 --> 30:10.480
there must've been
500 or 600 people on it.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.480
Everybody was
hueying everywhere -

30:12.520 --> 30:14.800
horizontal surfaces, vertical
surfaces, the ceiling,

30:14.840 --> 30:16.120
the food, everything.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.320
What did they do with it
when it got there?

30:18.360 --> 30:20.200
-Scuttle it.
-I think they must've done.

30:20.240 --> 30:23.560
Sometimes you've got to,
you've got no choice.
Happened to me.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.320
Our childhood car,
a Hillman Avenger,

30:25.360 --> 30:27.680
my little brother vomited
milk in the back of it.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.880
JEREMY: Ugh.
-Scrapped it. It's gone.

30:29.920 --> 30:32.800
-It just isn't any good.
-OK, I'll own up to
something.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.120
Oh, are you sure?

30:34.160 --> 30:36.040
I was driving through
Corsica, late for a plane,

30:36.080 --> 30:39.360
and I had my son in the back,
who was probably nine or ten.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.200
Going quite quickly.
It's all mountainous roads
through Corsica.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.360
Very hot day. And he
vommed explosively.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.400
And the upholstery was
that kind of textured velour.

30:47.440 --> 30:50.800
When we got to the
car rental return place,
still late for the plane,

30:50.840 --> 30:52.520
the guy's coming over
to check the car.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.880
I said, "It's all right,
mate, it's all in one piece."

30:54.920 --> 30:56.720
And folded
the back seat down.

30:56.760 --> 30:58.720
-Oh, you did not?
-Yeah, just...

30:58.760 --> 31:00.760
-Oh, you sick man!
-I know.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.600
-And left it.
-Yeah. Just left it. Ran.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.400
So somewhere there
is a kid who's paid

31:04.440 --> 31:07.320
two euros a day to
clean out returned hire cars.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.760
-And he encountered
that horror.
-I ruined his life.

31:09.800 --> 31:12.960
But the reason we brought up
all this car sickness stuff
is the RAC...

31:13.000 --> 31:16.280
Always up to speed,
the RAC is.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.520
It's put out some advice
saying that um...

31:18.560 --> 31:21.160
parents can stop
their children feeling sick

31:21.200 --> 31:23.680
if you can get them
to look at the horizon

31:23.720 --> 31:26.720
rather than the screens
on their mobile phones
or tablets.

31:28.040 --> 31:29.880
-Good luck with that.
RICHARD: Is that advice?

31:29.920 --> 31:31.360
"Go on, children,
look at the horizon.

31:31.400 --> 31:34.120
It's more interesting than
Angry Birds or Fortnite."

31:34.160 --> 31:36.760
Maybe they can persuade
them to tidy their bedrooms
afterwards as well.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.440
Yeah. Anyway, that's sick
covered. Let's move it along.

31:39.480 --> 31:42.280
I'd like to move it on with
some more conversation.

31:42.320 --> 31:45.920
Police in Dubai
are testing a hover-bike.

31:45.960 --> 31:48.240
But, no, it actually
is a hover-bike. Here it is.

31:48.280 --> 31:50.280
Look at that.
Look at that thing!

31:50.320 --> 31:51.760
Oh, my God.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.440
It costs about £117,000.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.480
It can go at 60 miles
an hour, fly for about
25 minutes.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.720
-Look at that.
JEREMY: Yes, yes.

31:59.760 --> 32:03.560
I can see a couple of things,
as a police-pursuit-vehicle
problem.

32:03.600 --> 32:07.560
If you drove at 61 miles an
hour, you'd get away from it.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.320
(LAUGHTER)

32:09.360 --> 32:11.320
Actually, you could drive
at less than that,

32:11.360 --> 32:14.440
but for more than 25 minutes
and still get away from it.

32:14.480 --> 32:17.600
Or, and here's another one
you haven't probably
considered:

32:17.640 --> 32:21.720
if you fell off it, you're
falling through your
own propulsion device.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.840
RICHARD: I don't care,
because look at it!

32:23.880 --> 32:26.880
I want one of those more
than I want both of my lungs.

32:26.920 --> 32:28.560
It is simply
the best thing I've ever--

32:28.600 --> 32:32.360
James, can you imagine
Richard Hammond on
one of those?

32:32.400 --> 32:33.720
(LAUGHTER)

32:33.760 --> 32:35.280
Literally minutes of fun.

32:35.320 --> 32:38.000
Yeah, exactly. And then
he would just be a mist.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.600
You'd just be a veneer all
over the nearest building.

32:40.640 --> 32:43.440
You'd actually be able to
walk through Richard Hammond.

32:43.480 --> 32:45.600
It would just be a puddle
of Richard Hammond.

32:45.640 --> 32:47.360
(LAUGHTER)

32:47.400 --> 32:49.520
All right.

32:49.560 --> 32:53.240
-Shit idea.
-Right. Erm...

32:53.280 --> 32:57.360
A lot of people have got it
into their heads that I don't
like electric cars.

32:57.400 --> 33:00.160
With good reason, because
every time you've got
an electric car,

33:00.200 --> 33:04.480
you come back into the office
on Monday morning with
another dreary tale of woe.

33:04.520 --> 33:06.600
-Cos you can't
charge them up!
-Here we go.

33:06.640 --> 33:09.840
You can't! Last weekend,
had a Jaguar I-PACE, OK?

33:09.880 --> 33:11.080
This is a really good car.

33:11.120 --> 33:13.640
This is why I have nothing
against electric cars.

33:13.680 --> 33:15.880
That's the new Jag,
and it is fabulous.

33:15.920 --> 33:18.400
Lovely to sit in,
quick as hell,

33:18.440 --> 33:21.800
better than a Tesla by
a long way, actually,
in many, many ways.

33:21.840 --> 33:25.880
Brilliant. However,
brought it up here,
plugged it into my farm.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.600
And boof!
Instant darkness.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.960
(LAUGHTER)

33:30.000 --> 33:33.040
This is a farm that can
supply all of Western Europe

33:33.080 --> 33:35.320
with vegetable oil
for a thousand years.

33:35.360 --> 33:39.800
Plug one Jag into it,
and I'm in the 13th century.
No electricity at all.

33:39.840 --> 33:42.120
I then took it to a friend's
house, plugged it in there -

33:42.160 --> 33:44.440
he's got more
modern electricity.

33:44.480 --> 33:47.000
Left it overnight and
it had only hoovered up

33:47.040 --> 33:50.760
enough electricity overnight
to cover 29 miles.

33:50.800 --> 33:54.560
That's because you're
plugging it into a
14th-century domestic socket.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.200
You're supposed to use a
proper modern fast charger.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.760
-How long would that take?
-45 minutes.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.160
I haven't got 45 minutes.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.720
I've only got 130,000 hours
left, James, before I die.

34:03.760 --> 34:06.360
I'm not going to spend
any of it... What?

34:06.400 --> 34:07.880
Wait a minute.

34:07.920 --> 34:10.040
This is a new thing of yours
that's started.

34:10.080 --> 34:11.640
"I've only got
130,000 hours."

34:11.680 --> 34:13.200
It's dropping.
It's dropping now.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.400
Where does...
It's a lovely thought.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.320
-(LAUGHTER)
-It's dropping...

34:20.160 --> 34:23.200
It is. Get on with it!
I'm losing valuable time!

34:23.280 --> 34:26.320
All right! I do wanna know,
though, where did
that number come from?

34:26.360 --> 34:27.680
Have you got your phone
on you?

34:27.760 --> 34:30.760
-Yes.
-Cos he always forgets
to leave it behind. OK.

34:30.800 --> 34:34.160
You don't have to tell
anyone - how many years
do you think you've got left?

34:34.200 --> 34:37.640
-Uh...years I've got left?
-Years, then times that
by 365.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.640
-Oh, I see.
-Times it by 24.

34:39.680 --> 34:42.680
-How many hours
have you got left?
-394,200.

34:42.760 --> 34:46.600
Right. Well, how much of that
do you want to waste...

34:46.640 --> 34:49.320
...charging a car, sitting
around while a car charges?

34:49.360 --> 34:51.280
I went on the BBC iPlayer
the other day,

34:51.320 --> 34:53.760
and it said, "You've now
got to register to use this."

34:53.800 --> 34:56.120
No, I haven't! I haven't
got time to do that.

34:56.160 --> 34:58.600
I'll be dead by the time
I've finished.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.640
I've got 14,200.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.320
(LAUGHTER)

35:02.360 --> 35:04.360
-James!
-What, hours?

35:04.400 --> 35:05.680
Yeah.

35:05.760 --> 35:08.840
That's a week on Tuesday!

35:08.880 --> 35:12.440
May, the whole point
of this exercise...

35:12.480 --> 35:14.640
...is you think
of the bloody number!

35:14.680 --> 35:18.800
"It's the rest of my life,
I better not think of a big
number, I'll be modest."

35:18.840 --> 35:21.200
Well, I'm gonna be
pleasantly surprised,
hopefully.

35:21.280 --> 35:22.640
Next week.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.920
I think we can probably end
Conversation Street there

35:24.960 --> 35:26.880
on James May's sad demise.

35:26.920 --> 35:30.080
Any minute now.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.640
I wanna talk about the BMW
M5, which has always been,

35:32.680 --> 35:36.480
as I'm sure we all know
in here, the ultimate Q car.

35:36.520 --> 35:40.360
It is a fizzing lunatic in
a Geoffrey Chaucer suit.

35:40.400 --> 35:43.640
However, the new M5
has turbo-charging,

35:43.640 --> 35:45.640
so it's kind to polar bears.

35:45.680 --> 35:48.120
And it has four-wheel drive,
so it's safe.

35:48.160 --> 35:51.480
And it has
an automatic gearbox,
and that's all very nice.

35:51.520 --> 35:53.280
But is it what we want?

35:55.280 --> 35:56.640
Let me, first of all,

35:56.640 --> 36:00.440
explain the basic recipe
for a BMW M5.

36:02.480 --> 36:06.120
It's a four-door saloon
with a boot at the back,

36:06.160 --> 36:09.000
space for five businessmen
in the middle

36:09.040 --> 36:12.640
and a monstrously powerful
engine at the front.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.880
That's the main thing
about an M5.

36:19.920 --> 36:23.080
It must be extremely fast.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.160
And this one, they say...

36:31.320 --> 36:32.880
...is the fastest ever.

36:37.080 --> 36:39.400
So I've just pulled up
alongside someone

36:39.440 --> 36:41.160
in his lightweight
running gear

36:41.160 --> 36:44.160
and his AMG training shoes.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.640
Whereas I am in
a stout pair of Brogues

36:46.640 --> 36:50.880
and some heavy
moleskin trousers.

36:50.920 --> 36:52.920
Which means
I'm gonna lose.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.320
Or am I?

36:57.440 --> 36:59.320
(ENGINES REVVING)

37:04.840 --> 37:07.320
Oh, that hurts!

37:07.360 --> 37:09.640
That was 0 to 60
in three seconds.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.080
I can't get my head forward!

37:14.960 --> 37:17.760
That's 100 miles an hour
in about seven seconds.

37:19.760 --> 37:21.280
120.

37:22.600 --> 37:25.000
130 miles an hour
as I cross the line.

37:28.760 --> 37:31.760
'Tis unbelievable, that.

37:31.800 --> 37:35.960
The cheap, heavy,
four-door saloon

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
just beat the sports car.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.360
That's an M5's job.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.920
On the face of it, then,
the new version

37:47.960 --> 37:51.520
seems to tick all the
important M5 boxes.

37:51.560 --> 37:56.000
It's sensible and
thanks to 592 horsepower,

37:56.040 --> 37:58.960
it is Ferrari fast.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.800
But what about the
turbochargers and the
automatic gearbox?

38:02.840 --> 38:06.080
And what about
the all-wheel drive system?

38:06.120 --> 38:08.360
Does all that mean
it's no longer capable

38:08.400 --> 38:11.440
of being
a swivel-eyed lunatic?

38:13.040 --> 38:14.640
No. Not really.

38:17.040 --> 38:18.520
(TYRES SCREECHING)

38:25.200 --> 38:29.120
Yes, because a great deal
of work has been done

38:29.160 --> 38:32.000
to completely eliminate
under-steer...

38:33.280 --> 38:34.680
...as you can see.

38:34.760 --> 38:37.680
The steering does feel
a bit weird.

38:42.080 --> 38:44.600
And yes, because
the engine is turbocharged,

38:44.640 --> 38:47.880
the soundtrack
is a bit muted.

38:50.280 --> 38:54.440
It's like listening to
someone play the bass...
in the next room.

38:55.440 --> 38:56.920
But other than that...

38:56.960 --> 38:58.680
(CHUCKLES)

39:01.680 --> 39:04.640
I mean, there must be
turbo lag. There has to be.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.680
But I can't feel it.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.080
And the automatic gearbox

39:11.120 --> 39:13.520
must change more slowly
than it would

39:13.560 --> 39:15.560
if it were
a double-clutch system.

39:15.600 --> 39:16.760
But...

39:19.360 --> 39:21.200
Still feels
pretty speedy to me.

39:24.120 --> 39:26.680
And even though
all four wheels are driven...

39:28.200 --> 39:30.000
...it can still do this.

39:35.960 --> 39:37.360
Holy shit!

39:41.160 --> 39:44.600
If you wanted to do this
all the time,

39:44.640 --> 39:48.560
you can actually turn off
the four-wheel drive system.

39:48.600 --> 39:51.560
Seriously,
you can turn it off!

39:51.600 --> 39:53.560
Just have it
in rear-drive only,

39:53.600 --> 39:55.880
behave like a complete yobbo.

39:55.920 --> 39:58.120
(TYRES SCREECH)

39:58.160 --> 40:00.160
(LAUGHS)

40:02.600 --> 40:07.560
And that's just the start
of the M5's adaptability.

40:07.600 --> 40:10.880
You can choose how much
traction control you'd like.

40:10.920 --> 40:12.960
You can choose...

40:13.000 --> 40:15.920
how sporty and responsive
you want the engine to be,

40:15.960 --> 40:17.800
how uncomfortable
you'd like the ride to be,

40:17.840 --> 40:20.120
how meaty you'd like
the steering to be,

40:20.160 --> 40:22.800
how quickly you want it
to change gear

40:22.840 --> 40:25.160
and what you want
on the head-up display.

40:25.160 --> 40:28.160
You can even choose
what sort of noise

40:28.160 --> 40:29.880
you want the exhaust to make.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.200
Ooh, and look at this one.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.120
This menu allows me to choose

40:33.160 --> 40:36.560
what fragrance comes out of
the air-conditioning vents.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.040
I can have the Blue Suite,

40:39.080 --> 40:41.680
which is a waft
of pure water pearls.

40:41.760 --> 40:43.560
Or I can have this one,

40:43.600 --> 40:48.880
which gives me a golden
shower of fiery aromas.

40:48.920 --> 40:51.600
And this is all very
Pacific Rim. It's very CGI.

40:51.640 --> 40:53.640
And that's great.

40:56.760 --> 40:58.600
But the truth
of the matter is

40:58.640 --> 41:01.000
that the 50-something
businessman

41:01.040 --> 41:02.560
who'll buy this car

41:02.600 --> 41:04.600
will never change
the fragrance setting

41:04.640 --> 41:07.920
or any of the other stuff.

41:07.960 --> 41:10.800
He'll put it in four-wheel
drive comfort mode on day one

41:10.840 --> 41:13.800
and leave it there forever.

41:15.280 --> 41:17.880
And if he's going to do that,

41:17.920 --> 41:20.320
there may be
a better alternative.

41:22.600 --> 41:26.640
It's made by a German tuning
company called Alpina.

41:26.680 --> 41:31.800
And it's another take on what
a fast BMW should be like.

41:31.840 --> 41:33.640
It costs about
the same as an M5,

41:33.640 --> 41:40.440
and has a broadly similar 4.4
litre, twin turbo-charged V8.

41:40.480 --> 41:45.480
It also has four-wheel drive
and an automatic gearbox.

41:45.520 --> 41:49.800
However, this car was not
developed at a race track.

41:49.840 --> 41:52.480
The boss of Alpina says
if you engineer a car

41:52.520 --> 41:54.080
to be good
at the Nurburgring,

41:54.120 --> 41:56.800
it won't be any good
on the road.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.320
And he may have a point
on that.

42:02.880 --> 42:07.160
So instead of making
the front suspension
firm and racy,

42:07.160 --> 42:09.800
they tuned it to be able
to deal with potholes.

42:11.560 --> 42:13.320
Then they changed
the steering

42:13.360 --> 42:16.400
so it would corner
more like an airliner

42:16.440 --> 42:19.520
and less like an F-16.

42:19.560 --> 42:21.760
Inside,
they gave it blue dials

42:21.800 --> 42:24.600
and a thinner steering wheel
and softer leather.

42:24.640 --> 42:27.040
And look at this.

42:27.080 --> 42:30.120
Something you don't get
in the standard M5.

42:31.320 --> 42:33.440
It's a comfort plus setting,

42:33.480 --> 42:35.880
in which the 50-something
businessman

42:35.920 --> 42:40.960
can spend his life
wafting about.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.200
But don't think that the
basic fast BMW recipe

42:45.280 --> 42:47.080
has been ruined.

42:47.120 --> 42:49.920
Because it really hasn't.

42:52.120 --> 42:54.920
It actually produces
600 horsepower.

42:54.960 --> 42:57.320
That's more than you get
from the M5.

42:57.360 --> 42:58.800
It has more torque too.

43:00.320 --> 43:02.560
And there's no nanny limiter.

43:02.600 --> 43:06.560
So this will do
205 miles an hour.

43:10.320 --> 43:12.320
Does this mean, then,
that on a track,

43:12.360 --> 43:14.680
the comfort wagon can keep up

43:14.760 --> 43:16.760
with the ultimate
sports saloon?

it was fun finding out...

43:32.120 --> 43:33.960
(LAUGHS)

43:38.800 --> 43:42.080
...the answer is no.
Not quite.

43:42.120 --> 43:47.360
The M5 is tauter, more nailed
down, more on it, somehow.

43:48.880 --> 43:51.280
So on a track,
make no mistake,

43:51.320 --> 43:53.800

I'm about to do,

dabbing off a bit of speed
at the midpoint.

45:44.320 --> 45:46.640
And ready?
Yep, really hard

45:46.680 --> 45:50.200
on the brakes
for Old Lady's House.

45:50.240 --> 45:53.320
This is where understeer
will show itself.

45:53.360 --> 45:58.200
But, no, looking tidy.
Not bad for such a heifer.

45:58.240 --> 46:01.800
Taking no prisoners
on the blast to Substation.

46:01.840 --> 46:03.520
Torturing the Pirellis
through there.

46:03.560 --> 46:06.120
Just Field of Sheep to go.

46:06.160 --> 46:09.120
Tidy through there
and across the line.

46:11.800 --> 46:16.120
-It did look quick.
-It looks quick
but it looks like it's heavy.

46:16.160 --> 46:17.480
It does look heavy.

46:17.520 --> 46:19.320
Anyway, there's the lap board

46:19.360 --> 46:22.120
and we can see the old M5,
look, down there:

46:22.160 --> 46:25.160
17th place, one minute 24.2.

46:25.200 --> 46:28.000
Uh, so let's see where
the new one goes.

46:28.040 --> 46:29.440
Is it quicker?

46:29.480 --> 46:30.600
-Ooh, it is.
-Yes.

46:30.640 --> 46:33.920
Ooh, my word,
four seconds faster.

46:33.960 --> 46:35.400
That's staggering, isn't it?

46:35.440 --> 46:37.560
That's absolutely amazing.

46:37.600 --> 46:42.080
Now, and I have to say,
uh, we did, um...
we did time the Alpina,

46:42.120 --> 46:43.920
but we haven't, uh,
we haven't filmed it.

46:43.960 --> 46:46.400
-Why not?
-Well,
cos it's gonna be slower.

46:46.440 --> 46:48.320
-(LAUGHTER)
-It is.

46:48.360 --> 46:50.560
You are gonna look
such an arse if it isn't.

46:50.600 --> 46:52.400
(LAUGHTER)

46:52.440 --> 46:54.280
I am, but it won't be.

46:54.320 --> 46:56.720
(GROANS) Let's find out.
Let's see where it goes.

46:56.760 --> 46:58.600
This is the Alpina.

46:58.640 --> 47:01.160
There you go. You see?
Slower. As I said.

47:01.200 --> 47:03.040
But 1:21.6, not bad. Not bad.

47:03.080 --> 47:06.760
So if you do want
a taut, fast, super saloon,

47:06.800 --> 47:09.280
his advice is get
the flabbier, slower one.

47:09.320 --> 47:11.160
-Yeah, it's better.
-This really is some clear

47:11.200 --> 47:13.480
-buying advice again this week.
-It is.

47:13.520 --> 47:16.000
Anyway, let's get on
to some actual clear buying
advice, uh, shall we?

47:16.040 --> 47:19.000
-Let's get back to
our film in Scotland.
-Mm-hm.

47:19.040 --> 47:22.640
Tonight, we are doing, uh, a
tour of the North Coast 500,

47:22.680 --> 47:24.160
around the top of Scotland,

47:24.200 --> 47:26.720
in some beautiful
Italian classic cars.

47:26.760 --> 47:29.040
-And a Fiat X19.
-(LAUGHTER)

47:29.080 --> 47:31.520
-Well, yes, but you two had
both had mechanical issues.
-Yes.

47:31.560 --> 47:36.600
Yeah, we did, but we still
had hope in our hearts
that things would get better.

47:45.640 --> 47:49.200
JAMES: As we cruised along,
our Italian classics,
and the Fiat,

47:49.240 --> 47:54.440
continued to provide
unexpected entertainment.

47:54.480 --> 47:56.480
I'm gonna show you
a fantastic feature
on this car.

47:56.520 --> 47:58.680
Here are the heating
and ventilation controls.

47:58.720 --> 48:00.720
I've got it on warm
because it's a cold day.

48:00.760 --> 48:04.920
But look what happens
when I press
the air-conditioning button.

48:04.960 --> 48:06.600
It's haunted!

48:06.640 --> 48:08.160
Did you see that?

48:08.200 --> 48:09.680
Look.

48:09.720 --> 48:12.040
Hm, I think
I'll cool myself down.

48:12.080 --> 48:14.080
(SINGS SPOOKY TUNE)

48:17.400 --> 48:19.720
My head itches
because of this hat.

48:19.760 --> 48:23.040
But if I take it off,
I'll freeze to death.

48:23.080 --> 48:27.640
JAMES: Soon, Hammond insisted
we stop for a cup of tea...

48:27.680 --> 48:30.760
to ward off his hypothermia.

48:30.800 --> 48:33.680
-I've had a thought.
-That's very
uncharacteristic of you.

48:33.720 --> 48:35.080
I was gonna say,
first time ever.

48:35.120 --> 48:37.240
No, this is based on
experience and knowledge.

48:37.280 --> 48:40.240
Right, problem with the NC500
going all way round here,

48:40.280 --> 48:41.880
we miss this bit.

48:41.920 --> 48:43.280
We're here, right?

48:43.320 --> 48:44.920
And we miss this road,

48:44.960 --> 48:47.440
which I have driven
and it is breath-taking.

48:47.480 --> 48:50.440
Not just the scenery,
which is incredible,
but the actual road itself.

48:50.480 --> 48:52.520
I'm sorry, but if we
just go along here...

48:52.560 --> 48:53.840
Yeah?

48:53.880 --> 48:57.320
...we're not exactly
doing the NC500, are we?

48:57.360 --> 49:03.000
No, but what if we create
our own route and claim it
for The Grand Tour .

49:03.040 --> 49:08.520
We could call that the
Scottish Highlands
Intermediate Tour.

49:08.560 --> 49:11.720
-How far is it?
-Uh, it's about 287 miles
if we do that.

49:11.760 --> 49:15.240
Scottish Highlands
Intermediate Tour 287, 2-8-7.

49:15.280 --> 49:17.720
It would be the sh...
No, hang on,
that doesn't work, does it?

49:17.760 --> 49:19.680
Piloting Extremely Nicely
In Scotland.

49:19.720 --> 49:21.480
-2-8-7.
-Yeah.

49:21.520 --> 49:26.360
So the Piloting Extremely
Nicely In Scotland 2-8-7.
That would do.

49:26.400 --> 49:28.440
You see? That's your
second thought of the day.

49:29.880 --> 49:32.840
It's cos of the hat.

49:32.880 --> 49:36.080
JEREMY: With the new route
sorted out, we set off.

49:36.120 --> 49:40.720
And it turned out
that it wasn't quite
like Hammond had said.

49:40.760 --> 49:43.400
It was much, much better.

49:50.480 --> 49:52.480
Holy moly.

49:55.680 --> 49:58.240
Och aye the view.

49:58.280 --> 50:00.280
It's amaz... Look at it.

50:03.480 --> 50:05.480
RICHARD: I mean, it's...
This is heaven.

50:08.560 --> 50:11.720
And not just the scenery,
which is magnificent;

50:11.760 --> 50:16.720
the road itself,
the twists, turns, surface.

50:16.760 --> 50:18.480
You have to get the right
ingredients together

50:18.520 --> 50:20.160
in the right order
in the right place.

50:20.200 --> 50:22.480
It's a complicated thing.

50:22.520 --> 50:24.480
A really fabulous road.

50:24.520 --> 50:26.520
But this manages it.

50:28.280 --> 50:30.480
Absolutely glorious.

50:41.120 --> 50:46.560
Oh, the PENIS287 is really
coming up trumps here.

50:53.320 --> 50:56.960
(REVVING ENGINE)

50:57.000 --> 51:00.080
God, I bet my car
looks elegant
going through this scenery.

51:11.240 --> 51:15.480
This is what the GTV6
was built to do.

51:15.520 --> 51:18.120
Open sweeping roads.

51:18.160 --> 51:20.400
(ROARING ENGINE)

51:20.440 --> 51:24.120
Nothing but the sound of
that V6 howling away.

51:24.160 --> 51:26.160
(ROARING ENGINE)

51:34.000 --> 51:36.560
Ah.

51:36.600 --> 51:39.680
This is what driving
is all about.

51:39.720 --> 51:41.120
This is the dream.

51:43.480 --> 51:46.560
In fact,
the moment was so magical,

51:46.600 --> 51:52.520
it had taken my mind
off something that had
been troubling me all day.

51:52.560 --> 51:59.400
Today is the 11th of April
and I don't wanna sound like
Eeyore, but it's my birthday.

51:59.440 --> 52:01.280
And those two
haven't remembered.

52:06.200 --> 52:08.480
All of the crew
have said happy birthday.

52:08.520 --> 52:10.800
The director
said happy birthday.

52:10.840 --> 52:13.200
James and Richard?
Nothing.

52:17.680 --> 52:19.640
Ullapool, 26 miles.

52:19.680 --> 52:25.120
Ullapool, I might be
able to get the prop shaft
balanced there.

52:25.160 --> 52:28.160
That's quite a big town.

52:28.200 --> 52:31.800
JEREMY OVER RADIO:
Guys, how far are we from
the hotel now? Do you know?

52:31.840 --> 52:34.000
About 30 miles, 35.

52:34.040 --> 52:36.440
Well, as it's not late,
I'm gonna dive into Ullapool

52:36.480 --> 52:38.840
and see if I can get
my prop shaft balanced.

52:38.880 --> 52:41.120
RICHARD OVER RADIO:
You're gonna what?
-It's vibrating

52:41.160 --> 52:42.800
and it will hurt the car,

52:42.840 --> 52:44.880
so I want to just
get it balanced up

52:44.920 --> 52:47.840
and I'll see you
at the hotel later on.

52:47.880 --> 52:51.920
That is uncharacteristically
conscientious of Jeremy, to
want to go and mend his car.

52:51.960 --> 52:54.280
But it's actually
very convenient
for me and Hammond.

52:54.320 --> 52:57.400
We've got something in mind.

52:57.440 --> 53:00.800
The thing is,
we hadn't forgotten
it was his birthday.

53:00.840 --> 53:04.280
And with him gone,
we could shoot ahead...

53:04.320 --> 53:07.040
and set up
his surprise party.

53:08.200 --> 53:09.640
Balloons coming in.

53:09.680 --> 53:11.880
Ooh, this is nice.

53:11.920 --> 53:16.520
-(RADIO IN BACKGROUND)
-Right, loosen it off.

53:16.560 --> 53:20.480
And that will allow
the prop shaft to settle
where it wants to settle.

53:20.520 --> 53:24.520
RICHARD:
While the short-sighted
orangutan ruined his car,

53:24.560 --> 53:28.400
-I was busy in the kitchen.
-(GRUNTS)

53:28.440 --> 53:34.520
For Jeremy's birthday feast,
I am preparing his favourite
dish, spaghetti bolognese.

53:34.560 --> 53:40.040
But as it's his birthday and
as we are here, I'm gonna
give it a Scottish twist.

53:50.160 --> 53:53.240
Pasta and sauce are ready.
He'd love that.

53:53.280 --> 53:56.960
But now is where I
give it a Scottish twist.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.240
Pop it in, back
for that in a minute.

54:01.520 --> 54:03.960
-(PINGS)
-Now, this should be ready.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.600
Oh, yeah.

54:06.640 --> 54:08.600
And this is where
it gets Scottish.

54:08.640 --> 54:13.640
Very carefully, you pop it
in the flour like this.

54:13.680 --> 54:15.320
Sprinkle it.

54:15.360 --> 54:18.440
Keeping it together
as best you can.
The grilling has helped.

54:18.480 --> 54:20.680
And now into this.

54:20.720 --> 54:22.720
Good coating all over.

54:25.600 --> 54:29.000
Drop that as carefully
as I can in there.

54:29.040 --> 54:31.560
-Pop it in the oil.
-(BUBBLING)

54:31.600 --> 54:32.880
Oh, yeah.

54:32.920 --> 54:34.920
Yes, I am doing that.

54:38.280 --> 54:42.240
I'd say... that is ready.

54:44.960 --> 54:46.720
Oh, yeah.

54:46.760 --> 54:48.120
That will do nicely.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.040
And there it is.

54:50.080 --> 54:52.960
Spaghetti Mc-Bolognese.

54:53.000 --> 54:57.520
JAMES: Whilst Richard was
battering and deep-frying
everything in sight...

54:57.560 --> 55:00.600
In you go, my wee beauties.

55:00.640 --> 55:02.800
...I was organising
the guests,

55:02.840 --> 55:06.320
who were now all here and
waiting for the birthday boy.

55:09.320 --> 55:12.160
Ooh, ooh, hello, here it is.

55:12.200 --> 55:14.000
Here it is...

55:14.040 --> 55:17.560
Oh, Countach,

55:17.600 --> 55:20.400
Lancia 832,

55:20.440 --> 55:24.600
There's obviously
some kind of classic
car meeting going on.

55:25.600 --> 55:27.600
Oh, wait a minute.

55:29.520 --> 55:31.640
I can't believe it.

55:31.680 --> 55:33.760
I cannot believe it.

55:33.800 --> 55:36.480
-You remembered.
-Of course we remembered.

55:36.520 --> 55:38.880
Actually,
it's better than that,
we're having a party for you.

55:38.920 --> 55:40.920
No, but, James...

55:45.680 --> 55:49.120
There's a classic car meet
going on.

55:49.160 --> 55:51.480
No, they're your guests.

55:51.520 --> 55:52.800
For your birthday party.

55:52.840 --> 55:55.480
-It's a 3.2 as well.
-Ohhh.

55:55.520 --> 55:59.840
You have invited
classic car enthusiasts
to my birthday party?

55:59.880 --> 56:02.600
Italian
classic car enthusiasts.

56:02.640 --> 56:04.760
-Who will talk
about differentials.
-Yes.

56:04.800 --> 56:07.240
-Production numbers
and chassis numbers.
-Yes, exactly.

56:07.280 --> 56:10.360
I've gotta go
and sort out the music,
so I'll see you in a bit.

56:10.400 --> 56:11.920
-Music?
-Yeah.

56:11.960 --> 56:13.960
It's a party.

56:15.680 --> 56:17.600
The finishing touch.

56:17.640 --> 56:19.000
Garnish.

56:19.040 --> 56:23.000
Because we eat with our eyes.

56:26.160 --> 56:30.080
JEREMY: As it turned out,
the classic car enthusiasts
were lovely people.

56:30.120 --> 56:33.640
With some even lovelier cars.

56:33.680 --> 56:35.520
Look at that.

56:35.560 --> 56:39.200
D'you know,
I've never driven an 832.

56:39.240 --> 56:42.160
However, talking to them
proved to be quite tricky.

56:42.200 --> 56:45.480
Were they not on their way
to America and then got here
and just thought, this'll...

56:45.520 --> 56:47.720
-(BAGPIPES START UP)
-...do.

56:47.760 --> 56:49.920
(PLAYING TUNELESSLY)
♪ Happy Birthday

56:56.440 --> 56:59.520
Still, it could be worse.
And then it was.

56:59.560 --> 57:04.320
Because it was time
to sit down for
Richard's Scottish dinner.

57:04.360 --> 57:09.400
Battered spag bol, followed
by a deep-fried cake.

57:19.960 --> 57:21.720
-(TAPPING)
-Oh, no.

57:21.760 --> 57:24.600
...James made
an interesting speech...

57:24.640 --> 57:26.800
about all the cars I'd owned.

57:26.840 --> 57:28.840
...to your ears as car
enthusiasts, is it not?

57:28.880 --> 57:34.080
But quite soon,
Jeremy moved on from
the VW Scirocco GLi mark 1

57:34.120 --> 57:37.280
to a VW Scirocco GTi mark 2.

57:37.320 --> 57:38.760
The registration number
of which was...

57:38.800 --> 57:41.160
Now I've never known whether
you had the manual gearbox

57:41.200 --> 57:45.320
or the first generation
F1 semi-automatic shift.
Which was it...

57:45.360 --> 57:48.240
Very keen for you to know
that it wasn't a CSi,
it was a CSL,

57:48.280 --> 57:49.680
the difference being...

57:49.720 --> 57:51.680
chromed wheel arch extensions

57:51.720 --> 57:54.120
and different wheels, was it?
Or something like
those stripes.

57:54.160 --> 57:57.200
Alpina wheels
and it had aluminium doors.

57:57.240 --> 58:00.200
-Yes, of course,
it had the lightweight...
-Bullet in boot lid.

58:00.240 --> 58:02.760
Ah, but this time
the V8 engine.

58:02.800 --> 58:05.720
In dark blue,
or was it black?

58:05.760 --> 58:07.600

drives a VW Golf GTI in grey.

58:18.360 --> 58:20.080
-You missed the CLK Black.
-Jeremy Clarkson...

58:20.120 --> 58:22.120
-The what?
-You missed the CLK Black.

58:23.840 --> 58:26.640
No, it's not on this list.
Which researcher put together

58:26.680 --> 58:28.200
this list of Jeremy's cars
through the ages?

58:28.240 --> 58:29.880
You didn't even
write the speech?

58:29.920 --> 58:31.480
Course I didn't.

58:31.520 --> 58:33.880
This is the worst birthday
party I've ever had.

58:33.920 --> 58:36.600
Come on, we made an effort.
Anyway, shall I
get the bagpipes?

58:39.880 --> 58:44.760
JEREMY: The next morning,
we were up and on the road
bright and early.

58:44.800 --> 58:51.000
This is the first April
the 12th since 1972 that
I haven't had a hangover.

58:51.040 --> 58:56.080
Thanks to the world's worst
party organisers, Messieurs
May and Hammond.

59:01.960 --> 59:03.240
Oh, no.

59:03.280 --> 59:05.280
The vibration is back.

59:08.080 --> 59:11.720
Ahh, why can't I do anything?

59:16.160 --> 59:19.920
But despite my problems,
the sun was shining.

59:19.960 --> 59:23.000
And Scotland was
more spectacular than ever.

59:42.840 --> 59:45.720
Hammond has redeemed himself
with this route.

59:45.760 --> 59:48.040
He really has.

59:48.080 --> 59:50.520
-(OVER RADIO) Hammond.
-Hello, yes?

59:50.560 --> 59:53.520
There's no getting around
the fact that your PENIS

59:53.560 --> 59:57.800
is exactly the right length
and beautiful.

59:57.840 --> 59:59.720
Well, thank you.

59:59.760 --> 1:00:01.880
JEREMY:
Would you agree, James May?

1:00:01.920 --> 1:00:05.160
JAMES: I would, yes.
I hate to have to admit it,
but it's spot-on.

1:00:08.120 --> 1:00:12.880
JEREMY: There were now
only 50 miles to go to
the finish point on our loop.

1:00:12.920 --> 1:00:16.920
So it felt like a good time
to sum up our wonderful cars.

1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:18.960
And Richard's Fiat.

1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:24.280
RICHARD:
Some cars achieve classic
status because they're rare,

1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:26.360
they're thoroughbreds
like those two.

1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:30.400
And with that, you have to
accept they'll be delicate,
temperamental.

1:00:30.440 --> 1:00:35.480
Some cars
achieve classic status simply
because they're really good.

1:00:35.520 --> 1:00:41.120
The X1/9 was good when
it was designed and built
first, and still is today.

1:00:41.160 --> 1:00:46.000
Add to that that it cost me
just over £2,000.

1:00:46.040 --> 1:00:48.720
Annoyingly, I've had a bit of
a problem with my headlight.

1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:51.440
But then
it's developed a squint.

1:00:51.480 --> 1:00:53.480
So it... Oh.

1:00:55.040 --> 1:00:57.600
I think it looks
quite rakish.

1:00:57.640 --> 1:00:59.520
Somehow piratical.

1:00:59.560 --> 1:01:01.440
"Arrr!" Like that.

1:01:03.360 --> 1:01:05.920
JAMES: Rare,
interesting, beautiful -

1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:08.560
those are the criteria
by which I think
you should judge

1:01:08.600 --> 1:01:10.800
whether or not a car
is a true classic.

1:01:10.840 --> 1:01:14.720
It has to be at least two
of those things to qualify.

1:01:14.760 --> 1:01:16.560
So let's have a look
at my Lancia.

1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:19.480
Well,
it's definitely beautiful.

1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:22.600
It's a truly superb
bit of car styling, this.

1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:24.840
And it's rare.

1:01:24.880 --> 1:01:26.880
(THRUMMING ENGINE)

1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:31.000
I had a bit of a root about
online last night

1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:37.400
and there are only two of
these Gamma Coupes registered
and on the road in Britain.

1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:39.240
And this is one of them.

1:01:39.280 --> 1:01:42.800
This is 50%
of the whole thing.

1:01:47.040 --> 1:01:50.280
When we finish
these jobs normally,
the cars we've used go...

1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:54.640
Actually, I've no idea
where they go.

1:01:54.680 --> 1:01:56.480
But I know
where this one's going.

1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:58.520
My house.

1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:05.920
Because this car
is just heaven.

1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:09.520
Absolute heaven.

1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:14.480
Look at it and tell me you
can think of another car

1:02:14.520 --> 1:02:19.720
anywhere on Earth
for 10 grand that
you'd like more than this.

1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:28.800
Only 11 miles to go now.

1:02:28.840 --> 1:02:31.360
Will James May's engine
explode?

1:02:31.400 --> 1:02:33.200
Apparently sunshine
does cause that.

1:02:33.240 --> 1:02:35.280
(OVER RADIO)
James May,

1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:36.960
do you think it will explode

1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:40.000
before we get to Inverness
or just afterwards?

1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:43.160
Sooner or later,
you will have to put
your peevishness aside

1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:45.320
and admit that I made
the right choice.

1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:47.240
Oh-ho, no, you didn't.

1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:49.600
Anyway, I wouldn't normally say
this, but I want to say

1:02:49.640 --> 1:02:52.120
I'm very proud of you for
mending your prop shaft.

1:02:52.160 --> 1:02:53.520
Well done, mate.

1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:55.160
Thanks, yes, yes.

1:02:55.200 --> 1:02:58.160
Is the car much better now
the vibration's gone?

1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:01.320
(QUIETLY) No.

1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:03.960
-Yes.
-Good.

1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:06.400
He's bluffing.

1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:15.840
JAMES:
Bidding a fond farewell to
Hammond's magnificent PENIS,

1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:18.480
we got back to the town
where we'd started,

1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:20.520
Inverness.

1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:23.520
Mission accomplished.

1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:37.440
Well, there we are. In just
three days, we have covered
a staggering 287 miles.

1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:40.080
Well, yours was on
an AA truck for a bit of it.

1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:41.520
-Yeah, a little bit.
-Yeah.

1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:44.880
But apart from one
catastrophic failure

1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:48.320
that required somebody
to drive from Swindon
in Wiltshire

1:03:48.360 --> 1:03:51.040
all the way to Inverness
with a spare part...

1:03:51.080 --> 1:03:53.120
Don't forget
that my windscreen wiper
fell off as well.

1:03:53.160 --> 1:03:54.400
Yeah, and one of
my headlamps is stuck.

1:03:54.440 --> 1:03:56.160
Yeah, but apart from
those things,

1:03:56.200 --> 1:03:59.240
we have proved
that it is still possible

1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:03.440
to buy and enjoy
a classic car

1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:05.640
even if you're quite poor.

1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:07.160
Yeah, we should be
proud of that.

1:04:07.200 --> 1:04:08.760
JEREMY: Yeah, we should.
BOTH: Yeah.

1:04:08.800 --> 1:04:11.040
With that,
back to the studio. Tent.

1:04:11.080 --> 1:04:12.560
-Tent.
-Tent.

1:04:12.600 --> 1:04:14.240
-Cos we're quite poor.
-Yes.

1:04:15.320 --> 1:04:17.640
(CHEERING)

1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:20.520
RICHARD: Great trip.
-Yeah.

1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:22.400
-It's, um...
-Yeah, it was good.

1:04:22.440 --> 1:04:24.960
-What a trip.
-It's funny, isn't it?

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.880
It's funny, over the years
we have travelled
the whole world

1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:29.800
-looking for
the best driving roads.
-Yeah.

1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:32.320
And it turns out, it was just
next door all along.

1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:36.520
I have to say, I don't want
to say this in front of our
Scottish producer.

1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:38.240
Do not name Gavin Whitehead.

1:04:38.280 --> 1:04:39.520
-No, I...
-(LAUGHTER)

1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:42.920
I shan't, but
that was just about

1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:44.360
the best drive I've ever had.

1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:47.560
That road, that scenery,
that Alfa.

1:04:47.600 --> 1:04:49.080
-That party.
-No, not the party.

1:04:49.120 --> 1:04:53.240
-OK.
-Everything else was...
Well, it was perfection.

1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:54.960
I do agree with you,
I thought it was spectacular,

1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:56.960
but we should get back to
the point of this film,

1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:00.840
which is that you can buy
an affordable classic car

1:05:00.880 --> 1:05:03.520
that is also an investment.

1:05:03.560 --> 1:05:06.120
Are you sure you wanna raise
this particular point, James?

1:05:06.160 --> 1:05:09.120
Why don't you tell the ladies
and gentlemen how it
worked out with your Lancia?

1:05:09.160 --> 1:05:12.520
Well, OK, I spent
13 and a half thousand pounds
on the car

1:05:12.560 --> 1:05:15.160
and when I got it home
I discovered the price
of putting it right

1:05:15.200 --> 1:05:17.760
-was only £6,000.
-(LAUGHTER)

1:05:17.800 --> 1:05:20.880
So, you're investment
has gone down by 45%.

1:05:20.920 --> 1:05:23.880
-Correct, yes.
-Mm, now my Alfa,
as I said in the film,

1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:25.480
I have brought it home
with me.

1:05:25.520 --> 1:05:28.000
And since we made that,

1:05:28.040 --> 1:05:30.840
which was April, so six
months, nine months ago,

1:05:30.880 --> 1:05:33.840
uh, it's only cost £8,000.

1:05:33.880 --> 1:05:35.120
-(LAUGHTER)
-In repairs.

1:05:35.160 --> 1:05:37.640
So, your investment
has gone down by 80%.

1:05:37.680 --> 1:05:40.160
-Yes, what about you?
-100%.

1:05:40.200 --> 1:05:41.360
-(LAUGHTER)
-Really?

1:05:41.400 --> 1:05:43.040
Yeah, day after
we finished filming,

1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:45.280
the engine blew,
car in the bin, all gone.

1:05:45.320 --> 1:05:46.840
(LAUGHTER)

1:05:46.880 --> 1:05:48.720
So, to conclude, then, s...

1:05:48.760 --> 1:05:52.040
All of us have lost
some money and one of us
has lost all of it.

1:05:52.080 --> 1:05:53.360
-Yes, exactly.
-Yes.

1:05:53.400 --> 1:05:55.120
And on that terrible
disappointment,

1:05:55.160 --> 1:05:56.440
it is time to end.

1:05:56.480 --> 1:05:58.720
I'm going home now
in my Alfa Romeo.

1:05:58.760 --> 1:06:00.680
-No, you're not.
-(LAUGHTER)

1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:02.720
-I only live over there.
-Yeah, we know.

1:06:02.760 --> 1:06:04.520
-Exactly, too far.
-(LAUGHTER)

1:06:04.560 --> 1:06:07.320
Whatever. Thanks for
watching, take care,
see you next time. Bye.

1:06:07.360 --> 1:06:09.360
(CHEERING AND WHISTLING)
