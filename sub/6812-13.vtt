WEBVTT

00:02.580 --> 00:04.411
MAN:
We have shots fired,
402 River Street.

00:04.500 --> 00:06.331
Get the exits,
exits, exits.

00:06.420 --> 00:08.331
Let's go, go, go, go.
Let's go.

00:16.260 --> 00:18.637
AL: Remind me why
we came in here.

00:18.760 --> 00:20.307
'Cause you're
a glory hound.

00:20.430 --> 00:23.263
Even_I remember
coming In alone
was your idea.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.357
All right, two guards
have already been shot.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.930
Any ideas how
to stop this guy

00:28.020 --> 00:30.022
before this turns
into a bloodbath?

00:30.440 --> 00:32.067
No, not really.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.025
Guess we found him.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.906
All right, cover me.
I'm heading upstairs.

00:38.990 --> 00:41.788
Yeah, there you go,
stealing my glory again.

00:41.870 --> 00:43.110
Be careful.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.477
Turn around and
drop your weapon!

01:04.600 --> 01:05.806
Now!

01:11.480 --> 01:12.981
Six in a row.

01:13.490 --> 01:14.479
What?

01:15.110 --> 01:16.486
Way to go.

01:19.370 --> 01:20.735
BOTH: Yeah!
Yes!

01:20.830 --> 01:22.900
Six in a row!
Way to go!

01:26.000 --> 01:27.661
No.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.587
Oh, my

01:53.110 --> 01:55.271
Great work taking down
that shooter, boss.

01:55.360 --> 01:58.488
Two security guards he shot
are gonna pull through.
We got luclq.

01:58.570 --> 02:00.026
No, we got Carrie Wells
on our side.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.360
How's she doing,
by the way?

02:02.450 --> 02:04.031
Let's all keep an eye
on her today.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.696
Absolutely.
Of course.

02:05.830 --> 02:08.663
All right,
we need to figure out
what just happened here.

02:08.750 --> 02:11.492
An act of terrorism,
disgruntled former employee,

02:11.590 --> 02:13.490
someone making
a political statement?

02:14.090 --> 02:15.660
What do we know
about this guy?

02:16.880 --> 02:18.871
Eli Condon, 45,
worked as columnist

02:19.010 --> 02:20.580
in a small newspaper
out in Westchester,

02:20.720 --> 02:22.210
married, three kids.

02:22.350 --> 02:25.012
According to the co-workers
I talked with, he's the
nicest guy in the office.

02:25.100 --> 02:26.226
They're all totally shocked.

02:26.310 --> 02:28.551
They sense anything off
with him recently,

02:28.690 --> 02:29.896
problems at home,
at work?

02:30.020 --> 02:31.260
No, there's nothing
like that.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.389
The guy has
a clean record.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.226
He doesn't even
have a parking ticket.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.850
Why the old power plant?

02:36.240 --> 02:37.810
Been shut down
for six months.

02:38.150 --> 02:41.233
Anyone in his family
work there or for
that company?

02:41.320 --> 02:43.402
There's nothing linking him
to the power plant.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.111
I can't eyen find
any evrdence

02:45.240 --> 02:48.073
that Condon set foot
on Roosevelt Island
before today.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.912
All right, well, then what
the hell was he doing there?

02:50.000 --> 02:53.242
History of mental illness,
suffering from PTSD?

02:53.340 --> 02:54.489
Guy shoots a gun
like that,

02:54.590 --> 02:56.546
__ he must have _
military experience, rIght?

02:56.630 --> 02:58.257
He's got a clean
bill of health.

02:58.380 --> 03:00.086
Guy's got
no service record.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.592
It's looking like Eli Condon's
a totally normal guy.

03:02.680 --> 03:05.638
No, totally normal guys
don't go on shooting rampages.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.091
Something set Condon off.

03:07.220 --> 03:08.926
Keep digging into him.
Yeah, you got it.

03:09.020 --> 03:12.342
Jay, work up a timeline
of Condon's movements

03:12.440 --> 03:13.555
leading up to the shooting.

03:13.650 --> 03:15.311
We need to know
if he was a lone wolf

03:15.440 --> 03:16.850
or if_ others
were Involved.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.527
Hey, Delina,
I need to see the body.

03:20.610 --> 03:21.736
Hey.

03:21.820 --> 03:24.653
Thought you were ordered
to take the day off
to meet with psych services.

03:24.780 --> 03:27.783
Yeah, well, you know
how I feel about
psych servrces.

03:28.540 --> 03:29.655
Take a look.

03:33.710 --> 03:35.029
Something
bothering you?

03:35.710 --> 03:37.450
Ever since
I saw him today,

03:37.550 --> 03:41.088
I keep getting this feeling
that I've met him before,

03:41.180 --> 03:42.465
but I know I haven't.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.720
MAN: Six in a row!

03:55.060 --> 03:56.436
Carrie, what is it?

03:56.520 --> 03:59.523
Nothing.
Can you talk to me
about the autopsy?

03:59.650 --> 04:03.108
Um, did you find anything
unusual, out of the ordinary?

04:03.200 --> 04:04.440
A small puncture
on his shoulder.

04:04.530 --> 04:06.077
Could have been
from a needle.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.446
_Lab tests will tell me
If there was anything
in his system.

04:08.870 --> 04:09.859
Okay.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.115
Thanks.

04:15.710 --> 04:17.086
Listen, I...

04:17.670 --> 04:19.046
I haven't thought about...

04:20.170 --> 04:21.626
...t_his carnival
In years.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.501
And then I see Eli
at the power plant,

04:24.640 --> 04:28.303
and suddenly it's popping
into my head over and over,

04:28.390 --> 04:30.767
and I don't know
why except that

04:30.850 --> 04:33.182
I feel like there's some
kind of connection

04:33.270 --> 04:34.726
between Eli
and the carnival.

04:34.850 --> 04:36.351
I just...
I don't know what it is.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.107
All right, relax.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.278
Put yourself back
at that carnival, all right?

04:42.360 --> 04:44.521
If Eli Condon is there,

04:44.610 --> 04:47.067
we'll find him together.
We've done this before.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.197
Focus and just
tell me what you see.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.122
MAN: Here we go. Come on,
Carrie, you got this.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.246
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

05:01.710 --> 05:04.167
I'm throwing balls
at the milk bottle toss.
MAN: Whoo!

05:04.260 --> 05:05.249
Yes, yes!

05:05.970 --> 05:07.540
Whoo!

05:09.050 --> 05:10.426
I won six times.

05:13.430 --> 05:16.012
Six in a row.
Way to go!

05:22.030 --> 05:23.895
Whoo!
Yes, Carrie, yes!

05:24.610 --> 05:27.067
The guys from the task force
are there with me.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.537
Do you see
Eli Condon anywhere?

05:36.870 --> 05:38.622
Where are you, Eli?

05:43.920 --> 05:44.966
What?

05:45.090 --> 05:46.250
What is it?

05:46.930 --> 05:49.251
I was at the carnival,
but then it was gone,

05:49.390 --> 05:51.039
and then I was
someplace else...

05:52.470 --> 05:54.518
Someplace
I've never been,

05:55.100 --> 05:57.386
but it felt_ |ike_I was
re-experIencmg It,

05:57.480 --> 06:00.722
like a memory,
which doesn't make any sense.

06:00.810 --> 06:02.357
Something's
going on here.

06:03.150 --> 06:05.778
You said something
about a task force?

06:05.900 --> 06:07.140
I don't want to
talk about that.

06:07.280 --> 06:10.067
Oh, I think we should.
Has anyone talked
to Eli's wife?

06:10.490 --> 06:11.479
No.

06:12.410 --> 06:13.900
Well, let's start there.

06:13.990 --> 06:15.036
Okay.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.666
MRS. CONDON: Your people have
been here all day,

06:21.790 --> 06:23.451
tearing the place apart,

06:23.590 --> 06:27.333
treating Eli like he's some
terrorist or something.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.421
What am I supposed
to tell my girls?

06:30.510 --> 06:32.887
Mrs. Condon,
we know this is difficult.

06:32.970 --> 06:35.347
We're just trying
to understand

06:35.470 --> 06:37.131
how your husband
could behave in a way

06:37.230 --> 06:39.721
so unlike the incredible man
you just told me about.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.975
Was he upset lately?

06:43.480 --> 06:44.856
Problems at home?

06:45.280 --> 06:47.180
Eli never had
a bad day.

06:48.110 --> 06:49.737
He was always so...

06:50.280 --> 06:52.521
...cheerful
and optimistic,

06:53.330 --> 06:55.366
the gentlest
person I knew.

06:56.830 --> 06:59.207
Is it possible he was
hiding something from you?

06:59.330 --> 07:00.957
We didn't
keep secrets.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.240
Eli was happy.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.252
He adores
his kids, and...

07:07.880 --> 07:11.008
We were about to celebrate
our 10th anniversary
with a trip to Italy.

07:11.090 --> 07:12.079
VVhen?

07:12.340 --> 07:13.500
A few weeks.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.006
We were supposed to go
on a biking tour.

07:16.140 --> 07:18.472
Eli's been training
every morning and night.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.380
Just last night,
I told him to cut it out

07:20.520 --> 07:23.933
after he swiped a car
and nearly got killed.

07:24.020 --> 07:25.476
How bad was
the accident?

07:25.820 --> 07:28.687
He went over the
handlebars. The helmet
got the worst of It.

07:29.780 --> 07:32.772
I forced him to go
to the emergency room,
and they ran some tests,

07:34.280 --> 07:36.077
but everything checked out.

08:06.730 --> 08:08.561
Eli left this morning

08:09.480 --> 08:11.562
at the normal
time, 8:15,

08:11.650 --> 08:14.562
and texted from the office
saying he was feeling better.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.235
You had no idea he was
going into the city?

08:17.370 --> 08:20.191
None. He didn't
like the city. He felt...

08:20.910 --> 08:22.571
Claustrophobic. ..

08:23.370 --> 08:24.416
Although...

08:24.500 --> 08:25.660
What?

08:25.750 --> 08:28.662
He went into Manhattan
yesterday for a job InterVIew.

08:28.750 --> 08:31.082
Why would he get a job
in the city if he didn't
like it there?

08:31.170 --> 08:33.422
You know what
a suburban paper pays?

08:34.090 --> 08:36.923
He was supposed to meet
with a political news website,

08:37.430 --> 08:39.091
Metropolis Report.

08:40.390 --> 08:43.188
Eli said he'd be a fool
to turn his nose
at that kind of money.

08:43.640 --> 08:44.937
You know who
he met with?

08:45.020 --> 08:47.477
No, but they canceled
at the last minute.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.278
Excuse me, I found this
in your daughter's room.

08:51.360 --> 08:52.395
Do you know
where it came from?

08:52.780 --> 08:56.272
Lulu has a lot of toys
and stuffed animals. I...

08:56.950 --> 08:58.076
I have no idea.

08:58.160 --> 08:59.570
Do you think maybe your
husband gave it to her?

08:59.660 --> 09:00.900
Maybe.

09:00.990 --> 09:03.288
He always brought her presents
from his work trips.

09:03.370 --> 09:05.418
Okay, so do you think
maybe he could have

09:05.500 --> 09:06.819
gotten it
at a carnival?

09:06.960 --> 09:08.029
A carnival upstate?

09:08.130 --> 09:09.119
Carrie.

09:09.210 --> 09:11.121
_ I... A carnival
In Warrensburg, perhaps?

09:11.210 --> 09:13.792
I told you, I don't know
where it came from.

09:14.260 --> 09:16.637
Well, maybe I can
talk to your daughter.
She might know.

09:16.760 --> 09:17.829
Carrie, enough.

09:19.810 --> 09:22.301
Thank you for your time,
Mrs. Condon.

09:25.390 --> 09:28.302
What was that about?
Her husband shot
two security guards,

09:28.400 --> 09:30.766
shot at us, okay?
He's the criminal,
not the victim.

09:30.860 --> 09:32.816
I was asking questions,
which is my job.

09:32.900 --> 09:33.889
You should try
doing yours.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.480
That woman doesn't
know anything.

09:35.570 --> 09:36.776
What was that
about a stuffed animal?

09:36.860 --> 09:38.407
I... I don't know.

09:38.490 --> 09:41.197
Somehow Eli is attached,

09:41.330 --> 09:44.993
connected to this carnival
and these images
I keep having in my head.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.031
Look, I have complete
faith in your memory,

09:47.170 --> 09:48.706
but I also know
you obsess over things,

09:48.830 --> 09:49.876
and I don't want to see
that happen.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.298
How many times do I have
to tell you that I don't need
you to protect me,

09:52.380 --> 09:54.666
I don't want you
to protect me? I'm fine.

09:54.800 --> 09:55.789
Mmm-hmm.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.709
Jay?
Yup?

10:03.850 --> 10:06.637
Any progress tracking
Condon's movements today?

10:06.730 --> 10:08.550
He did go to work
like his wife said,

10:08.690 --> 10:11.397
but then he got
on the Metro North at
10:55 out of Scarsdale,

10:11.520 --> 10:13.351
got into Grand Central
at 11:40 am.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.852
Shooting took place
about an hour
after he arrived.

10:15.940 --> 10:17.771
Did you find
any calls, emails

10:17.860 --> 10:19.521
prompting him
to head into the city?

10:19.870 --> 10:22.987
No, nothing. Looks like
he got here, headed straight
for the power plant.

10:23.330 --> 10:24.866
Not much
to work with.

10:24.950 --> 10:26.998
Anything on his
job interview yesterday?

10:27.080 --> 10:28.456
You mean alleged
job interview, right?

10:28.790 --> 10:29.870
Alleged?

10:29.960 --> 10:33.043
No one at Metropolis Report
knows anything about
Eli Condon.

10:33.130 --> 10:35.041
All right, his wife said
it was canceled last-minute.

10:35.170 --> 10:37.377
Did he get any calls around
the time of the interview?

10:37.470 --> 10:40.132
His only incoming call around
that time was a robot-call.

10:40.220 --> 10:42.381
So the job interview
story was bogus?

10:43.640 --> 10:45.380
What, having an affair?

10:45.470 --> 10:47.222
Why lie to his wife,

10:47.310 --> 10:49.221
and where would he have
this romantic rendezvous?

10:49.350 --> 10:51.341
Already ahead
of you, boss.

10:51.440 --> 10:53.476
Looks like he got a bottle
of water and some breath mints

10:53.570 --> 10:56.812
at a bodega down on
East 4_9th Street as soon as he
got into the City yesterday.

10:56.900 --> 11:00.028
I did a facial recognition
search on all the cameras
in the immediate area,

11:00.110 --> 11:02.271
and we got a positive match
for Eli Condon.

11:02.410 --> 11:05.538
11:32 yesterday morning,
he enters the
Ardmore building.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.030
You get him
coming out too?

11:07.120 --> 11:08.997
Exits the building
at 1:45 pm.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.742
The building doesn't exactly
scream, "affair," does it?

11:11.880 --> 11:14.121
So what was he doing
in there for two hours?

11:14.420 --> 11:16.297
I don't know,
but get this.

11:16.670 --> 11:19.252
Visitors log
show no record of Eli.

11:19.550 --> 11:21.586
There's only three names
in that time period,

11:21.720 --> 11:23.096
and they're
all women.

11:24.300 --> 11:25.756
We need to know
who he was visiting.

11:25.890 --> 11:27.926
Boss, that building's got
hundreds of tenants.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.056
Get his picture to every
office in that building.

11:30.140 --> 11:32.267
Someone in there has
a connection to our shooter.

11:32.730 --> 11:33.890
You got it.

11:33.980 --> 11:34.969
Come on, come on.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.526
Valerie, right?

11:40.950 --> 11:42.941
Yeah, we met
at the ski lodge

11:43.070 --> 11:45.277
in Vermont a few years back.
Oh, come on.

11:45.410 --> 11:46.820
You still work
for Vogue?

11:46.950 --> 11:49.692
October 24, 2001,
you read an article in Maxim

11:49.790 --> 11:52.418
that told you role-playing
spices things up
in the bedroom.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.458
Well, things must have gotten
pretty spicy that night

11:55.590 --> 11:57.126
for_me to remember
it so perfectly.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.377
Except that my name
was Victoria

11:59.460 --> 12:00.870
and I worked
for The Atlantic.

12:00.970 --> 12:04.633
You had a giggling fit every
time I referred to your
chosen name of Chet.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.096
And then things
got so weird,

12:06.180 --> 12:09.308
you started sweating
profusely and had a
panic attack. Game over.

12:09.430 --> 12:10.476
How's that for spicy?

12:10.930 --> 12:13.558
Ah, poor Chet doesn't
know what he missed.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.891
So, Eli Condon.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.892
Jay tracked him
to the Ardmore
building yesterday.

12:20.490 --> 12:21.639
We're working on
who he met with.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.903
So far we don't have a contact
for Eli in the building,

12:25.530 --> 12:28.021
but the only call
Eli got yesterday

12:28.160 --> 12:29.650
was from a burner cell.

12:29.740 --> 12:31.196
It lasted eight seconds.

12:31.710 --> 12:32.950
So we got nothing.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.576
We keep hitting
roadblocks with this.

12:35.670 --> 12:38.207
I mean, we're not
getting anywhere.
Maybe I should just...

12:39.340 --> 12:42.161
Man up and talk to the people
on the task force,

12:42.670 --> 12:44.718
see if they remember
anything about Eli.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.216
Maybe they knew him.
I don't know.

12:46.340 --> 12:47.716
Now, listen,

12:48.510 --> 12:50.011
I'm in the dark here.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.306
Talk to me.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.686
It was 2006.

12:58.060 --> 12:59.857
I'd left Syracuse.
I'd left you.

12:59.940 --> 13:02.022
I wanted to leave it
all behind.

13:03.030 --> 13:04.736
I was done being a cop,

13:08.030 --> 13:09.076
CIA.

13:10.910 --> 13:14.323
They recruited me
because of my
special abilities.

13:16.540 --> 13:18.167
We were assigned with...

13:18.840 --> 13:22.958
...with tracking down
a rogue NSA agent
and taking him out.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.927
He was leaking
classified information
to the wrong people.

13:27.050 --> 13:28.881
No one could find him,
but we did.

13:30.390 --> 13:32.210
We found him,
and we killed him...

13:34.350 --> 13:35.806
And then it was over.

13:36.390 --> 13:38.802
We disappeared
back into our own lives,

13:39.730 --> 13:42.437
weren't allowed
to contact each other,
but that was fine with me.

13:42.570 --> 13:44.561
I wanted nothing to do
with any of them.

13:46.030 --> 13:47.566
Too many...
Memories.

13:51.910 --> 13:53.036
Right.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.281
Okay.

13:55.830 --> 13:58.207
Let's you and me
give this one more shot

13:58.880 --> 14:00.336
before you reach out.

14:00.750 --> 14:01.796
Okay.

14:01.920 --> 14:06.129
I did a little research
on the Warrensburg Carnival
from 2006.

14:06.260 --> 14:07.670
Figured ifI tell you
a few details,

14:07.760 --> 14:09.170
maybe it'll
trigger something.

14:10.510 --> 14:11.636
Okay.

14:11.760 --> 14:14.718
So, while
at this carnival,

14:14.810 --> 14:18.348
did you enjoy
John Ormsbee's
award-Winning

14:18.440 --> 14:20.476
"Grateful Red" chili?

14:22.610 --> 14:26.273
No, although I do love
a terrible pun with my chili.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.987
I'll bet you do.

14:28.240 --> 14:31.027
All right,
do you remember Estragon,

14:31.120 --> 14:33.236
grand champion
breeding heifer?

14:33.990 --> 14:37.289
No, I don't... I don't recall
a cow named Estragon.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.417
Okay, well, those are
the only two storylines

14:40.500 --> 14:44.049
coming out of the carnival
that the local paper
saw fit to print.

14:45.170 --> 14:48.219
There's no mention of your
soft-ball-throwing exploits.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.716
Well, there should have been.
I was on fire.

14:54.970 --> 14:56.130
BOTH: Yeah!

14:57.430 --> 14:58.556
No.

14:59.350 --> 15:03.138
October 20, 2006
is going to send me
over the edge.

15:03.230 --> 15:05.141
I have to figure
this out.

15:06.650 --> 15:08.982
October 20, 2006?

15:09.320 --> 15:10.309
Yes.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.230
You know, the, uh...

15:13.830 --> 15:17.152
Warrensburg Carnival
was on May 8th that year.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.707
No, that's impossible.

15:20.370 --> 15:22.531
Well, it's hard
to believe,

15:22.670 --> 15:24.240
but your memory's wrong.

15:32.180 --> 15:33.920
Okay, Peter Roach,
where are you?

15:34.010 --> 15:35.557
Where are you?

15:35.680 --> 15:37.762
"Special Agent Peter Roach,

15:38.100 --> 15:42.139
"killed in a training accident
on January 21, 2013."

15:45.360 --> 15:47.976
All right, Sam McQuaid.

15:50.780 --> 15:56.616
"ATF, killed in the
line of duty on
February 18, 2013."

15:58.370 --> 16:00.656
Peter and Sam died
within a month of each other.

16:04.670 --> 16:06.535
Emmet Grinwis.

16:06.630 --> 16:08.200
Don't tell me
you're dead too.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.252
"Terminated from the FBI
two years ago.

16:12.380 --> 16:14.883
"Three stays
in mental institutions.

16:15.550 --> 16:17.211
"Last known
address, Newburgh."

16:18.220 --> 16:19.710
What is going on?

16:21.520 --> 16:22.976
Brian Fenton.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.526
Hey.

16:28.610 --> 16:29.599
Hey.

16:29.730 --> 16:30.936
What are you doing
here so late?

16:31.070 --> 16:34.562
Jay, you're just
the guy I need.

16:35.200 --> 16:38.863
"Brian Fenton, ATF.
File sealed,
Top secret clearance only."

16:38.950 --> 16:42.249
Oh, so that's what you're
doing so late at night.

16:42.370 --> 16:43.860
You're breaking
Federal Law.

16:43.960 --> 16:47.703
I haven't broken any laws,
at least...not yet.

16:51.090 --> 16:52.125
No.

16:52.260 --> 16:54.421
No way.
No, not this time,
not happening.

16:54.550 --> 16:57.041
That file says,
"Stay away, Jay." No.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.348
Something's going on here,
and I need your help.

17:00.430 --> 17:02.921
You're the only one
I trust to do this.

17:03.060 --> 17:04.129
Please.

17:04.890 --> 17:06.721
You know what?
Just do me a favor, okay?

17:06.810 --> 17:08.892
Promise me you're gonna
say nice things at my trial

17:08.980 --> 17:10.891
after the Feds come drag me
out of here, all right?
Oh...

17:10.980 --> 17:13.392
Oh, thank you.
Oh, okay, right.

17:21.660 --> 17:22.945
Hey, look at you,

17:23.080 --> 17:25.287
in early doing paperwork
like a big guy.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.160
Yeah, I like it.
It classes you up a bit.

17:27.290 --> 17:29.087
It's just temporary
till Sandra gets back.

17:29.170 --> 17:30.410
We should know
in a day or two.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.502
Yeah, that's great,
but I'm just saying,
being the boss suits you.

17:32.630 --> 17:35.838
I take it you're here
for some other reason
than to annoy me, right?

17:36.180 --> 17:37.966
We tracked the
rifle Eli used.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.346
It's a military prototype.

17:40.470 --> 17:41.505
Prototype?

17:41.970 --> 17:43.301
It's supposed to be

17:43.770 --> 17:45.590
the sniper rifle
of the future.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.931
DoD scrapped the program
about five years ago.

17:48.020 --> 17:49.556
How did Eli
get his hands on it?

17:49.650 --> 17:54.815
Weapon he used traces
back to a pallet of guns
stolen from Langley, 2009.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.737
Langley,
as in home of the CIA?

17:56.820 --> 17:59.118
Get this, guns from
the same pallet

17:59.200 --> 18:02.237
used in the shootings
of Congressman Hill
about a year ago in New Mexico

18:02.330 --> 18:05.402
and the killing of journalist
Jeff Brooks in Virginia
a few months before that.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.321
The same prototype
was used in three shootings?

18:08.460 --> 18:10.701
Get me everything
you can on these other cases.

18:10.840 --> 18:11.829
All right.

18:20.470 --> 18:21.539
Hey.

18:22.010 --> 18:24.387
Hey. Thanks for
coming by.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.669
I tried Carrie,
but I couldn't get her.

18:25.770 --> 18:28.512
Yeah, she's seeing
an old colleague.
What do you got?

18:28.650 --> 18:30.971
So the tox results
came in for Eli Condon.

18:31.060 --> 18:34.518
Curious thing, he wasn't
drunk or high in the usual
sense of the word,

18:34.610 --> 18:37.352
but there were traces
of dextrolysergamide
in his system.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.156
Which is a good thing
or a bad thing?

18:39.240 --> 18:40.901
Dextrolysergamide
is part of a group

18:41.030 --> 18:44.284
of powerful antipsychotic
drugs called psychotropics.

18:44.370 --> 18:47.032
But we didn't find
any history of mental illness,

18:47.160 --> 18:49.537
and Eli wasn't taking
any prescribed medications.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.456
Right, but see, the thing
about psychotropics is

18:51.540 --> 18:53.201
they've been linked
to mind manipulation

18:53.290 --> 18:55.338
and mental control,
so it's possible that...

18:55.420 --> 18:56.830
Mind control?

18:56.920 --> 18:58.046
I know it sounds crazy.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.250
I'm just telling
you what I found.

18:59.380 --> 19:00.961
All right,
can you tell me

19:01.050 --> 19:03.553
when this drug was put
into Eli's system?

19:03.640 --> 19:05.710
Well, it's hard to
give an exact time,

19:05.810 --> 19:07.721
but I'd say within
the last 36 hours.

19:08.270 --> 19:11.728
So right around
the time Eli went into
the Ardmore building.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.397
Thank you.
You got it.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.816
Excuse me.
All right.

19:34.790 --> 19:36.041
Emmet?

19:50.770 --> 19:51.805
Emmet?

19:52.270 --> 19:53.339
I'm Carrie Wells.

19:54.730 --> 19:56.311
You're that memory cop.

19:56.650 --> 19:58.026
Yeah, that's right.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.107
You want to put
the gun down?

20:00.900 --> 20:02.356
I know why
you're here...

20:02.780 --> 20:03.769
...to kill me.

20:05.030 --> 20:06.941
Just like you
killed Roach.

20:08.290 --> 20:09.860
I didn't kill anybody.

20:14.580 --> 20:15.786
Emmet...

20:17.710 --> 20:19.541
I'm gonna put
my gun away.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.580
I just want to
talk to you.

20:23.550 --> 20:27.668
You remember
that carnival we went to,
all of us together?

20:30.140 --> 20:32.301
There's something
not right about that night.

20:33.810 --> 20:37.769
I think about that
carnival all the time.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.526
You do?

20:39.820 --> 20:41.936
It's kind of odd.

20:42.030 --> 20:45.102
My past, the present

20:45.200 --> 20:46.485
_ doesn't stick
With me anymore,

20:46.620 --> 20:49.692
but that carnival
is clear as day.

20:50.410 --> 20:53.152
What...what do you remember
about the carnival, Emmet?

20:53.290 --> 20:57.989
I remember me
and you and Pete,

20:58.500 --> 20:59.740
Sam...

21:00.920 --> 21:03.161
...celebrating.
Right.

21:03.300 --> 21:05.336
Walking around,

21:05.470 --> 21:06.880
had a few beers.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.841
And then I impressed
you all with my arm.

21:12.930 --> 21:14.056
What do you mean?

21:14.190 --> 21:15.509
The milk bottles.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.726
I knocked them over.

21:18.230 --> 21:20.061
No, I... I knocked
them over.

21:20.190 --> 21:22.738
Hell, no,
you didn't knock them over.

21:22.860 --> 21:24.191
You guys were
cheering me on.

21:24.320 --> 21:25.651
I couldn't have
done it without you.

21:27.700 --> 21:30.362
"Six in a row!
Way to go!"

21:33.370 --> 21:35.531
Sorry.
You remembered wrong.

21:36.540 --> 21:38.872
No. I don't

21:39.590 --> 21:41.706
I don't_ ever
remember things wrong.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.540
Are you saying you
threw all those strikes?

21:43.670 --> 21:44.830
Yeah.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.422
I knocked the
milk bottles down.
Where are you going?

21:49.010 --> 21:50.500
To prove your
memory wrong.

21:52.350 --> 21:55.387
If you played the game,
how did I wind up with this?

22:04.990 --> 22:07.060
Hey, hey, boss, listen.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.559
I looked into those shootings
like you asked for.

22:08.700 --> 22:10.110
Anything linking
to Eli Condon?

22:10.240 --> 22:12.868
Nothing definitive, right,
but the MO's the same
Two shooters.

22:12.950 --> 22:15.248
Armando Lockett,
Skip Camirand.

22:15.330 --> 22:16.786
Neither man had
any criminal record,

22:16.910 --> 22:20.073
weapons training,
mental illness,
political activism, nothing.

22:20.170 --> 22:21.876
Nothing pointing
to a history of

22:21.960 --> 22:23.791
or capacity for
violence, whatsoever.

22:24.460 --> 22:26.007
Both men...

22:26.090 --> 22:27.466
Killed themselves
after the shooting.

22:28.720 --> 22:29.926
Sounds familiar.

22:30.220 --> 22:32.757
ME reports showed some kind
of weird drug in their system.

22:32.850 --> 22:35.262
A dextro...
Dextrolysergamide.

22:35.600 --> 22:36.885
It's a mind control drug.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.186
How do you know what?

22:38.270 --> 22:40.090
It was in Eli's
system too.

22:40.230 --> 22:42.266
All right, come on,
boss, seriously?

22:42.360 --> 22:45.648
What, are we getting into
some kind of conspiracy
theory stuff here?

22:45.780 --> 22:47.486
Killing of a
political journalist,

22:47.860 --> 22:49.441
shooting a...a congressman?

22:49.530 --> 22:53.114
All right. Shooting up
a closed power plant
doesn't really track...

22:54.040 --> 22:56.361
...unless our shooter
was just in the wrong spot?

22:58.330 --> 23:00.821
You know what?
Put together a list of
potential targets

23:00.960 --> 23:02.746
in the area of
yesterday's shooting.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.205
All right.

23:08.760 --> 23:11.297
Hey, listen,
I went to see Emmet, okay,

23:11.430 --> 23:13.887
one of the guys
on the task force.

23:13.970 --> 23:16.302
Now, he had a memory
of the carnival too.

23:16.430 --> 23:18.136
Except that his...
I told you I'd go with you.

23:18.270 --> 23:19.305
I know, I know,
but listen.

23:19.390 --> 23:22.188
He remembers everything
like I do of that carnival,

23:22.310 --> 23:23.937
except that in
his memory

23:24.020 --> 23:26.568
he's the one who was
throwing the softball, not me.

23:26.650 --> 23:27.856
Now, this
guy is loopy.

23:27.990 --> 23:32.404
He barely remembered
who I was, but the carnival
is crystal clear in his mind.

23:32.490 --> 23:35.653
It's bizarre. I don't know.
Something is going on here.

23:36.080 --> 23:40.198
We found two other
shootings in the last year
with a similar M0 to Eli's.

23:40.330 --> 23:43.322
All three men had traces
of a psychotropic
in their systems.

23:43.460 --> 23:46.918
It's possible someone
manipulated these shooters.

23:47.550 --> 23:48.869
What are you saying?

23:49.010 --> 23:50.250
Mind control drugs?

23:50.340 --> 23:51.830
JAY LEE: Hey, Carrie.

23:52.260 --> 23:55.502
That file you wanted to
read about, that guy you used
to work with, Brian Fenton?

23:55.970 --> 23:57.050
You got in?

23:57.180 --> 23:58.169
Yep.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.936
Okay, so this guy
Brian Fenton's claiming

24:05.020 --> 24:06.851
that he was in the ATF?
Bogus.

24:06.980 --> 24:08.356
For the past 35 years,

24:08.480 --> 24:10.778
this guy's been
in the scientific intelligence
division of...

24:10.860 --> 24:12.771
Of the CIA. _
JAY LEE: Yup, you got it.

24:12.860 --> 24:17.194
In the early '805 he oversaw
a Black Ops project
called MJ Volt.

24:17.290 --> 24:18.996
_And it looks like
it was a program

24:19.080 --> 24:21.071
aimed at making
American soldiers immune

24:21.210 --> 24:23.166
_ to_Soviet _
interrogation techniques

24:23.250 --> 24:25.992
using mind control
and memory manipulation,

24:26.090 --> 24:27.876
also known
as brainwashing.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.797
Only researchers
started to believe

24:29.880 --> 24:31.711
that they could
use the same techniques

24:31.800 --> 24:34.212
to gain control
over unsuspecting subjects.

24:34.340 --> 24:37.639
So agents so covert
they don't even know
their own involvement?

24:37.720 --> 24:39.210
Okay, "Started to believe"

24:39.350 --> 24:41.511
is very different
than actually
accomplishing, okay?

24:41.600 --> 24:44.182
Which this program
never did, did they?

24:44.270 --> 24:46.056
No, actually.

24:46.190 --> 24:49.398
Project Volt didn't achieve
anything other than
losing a ton of dough.

24:49.530 --> 24:51.066
Got shut down
in 1986.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.179
Exactly.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.601
Jay, did you
find anyone else

24:54.740 --> 24:56.947
associated with
this Project Volt?

25:01.410 --> 25:02.650
JAY LEE: Actually, Carrie,

25:02.750 --> 25:05.071
I did find a list
of professors and scientists

25:05.170 --> 25:06.569
linked to the project,
so, yeah.

25:06.710 --> 25:09.087
Look, I just think
we should consider
the possibility

25:09.210 --> 25:10.757
that someone
rebooted this program

25:10.840 --> 25:11.955
and made it operational,

25:12.090 --> 25:14.422
and somehow
you might be involved.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.079
Oh, my God.

25:16.220 --> 25:19.257
There is no way
someone got into my head,

25:19.350 --> 25:21.636
brainwashed me
without me knowing it.

25:21.770 --> 25:23.670
Will you please
just look at the photos

25:23.770 --> 25:25.431
and see if you
recognize anyone?

25:25.520 --> 25:26.475
Yes.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.147
If this project
is active,

25:28.270 --> 25:29.601
someone else might die.

25:29.690 --> 25:30.770
You might be the one
who could stop it.

25:30.900 --> 25:33.607
I just said yes.
Show me the photos.

25:34.950 --> 25:36.941
Okay.
No.

25:37.450 --> 25:39.111
Nope.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.440
No.

25:40.790 --> 25:41.984
No.

25:44.410 --> 25:45.399
Stop there.

25:45.790 --> 25:47.997
Six in a row!
Way to go!

25:49.630 --> 25:52.121
Dr. Edward Wythe, Yale?

25:52.250 --> 25:53.831
No, no.

25:53.970 --> 25:56.211
That guy's not a doctor.
He's a carny.

25:56.590 --> 25:58.137
I mean,
he's the guy who was

25:58.220 --> 26:00.632
working the milk bottle
toss at the carnival. It's...

26:00.760 --> 26:01.840
Are you sure?

26:01.970 --> 26:03.176
Yes, I'm sure.

26:03.560 --> 26:04.970
If that's true,

26:05.100 --> 26:08.092
Wythe might be
who Eli went to see
at the Ardmore building.

26:08.850 --> 26:11.318
Well, I guess
there's only one way
to find out, isn't there?

26:17.700 --> 26:20.362
AL: Building security
says a man resembling Wythe

26:20.490 --> 26:21.821
but using
a different name

26:21.910 --> 26:24.242
is renting an office
here in the basement.

26:43.720 --> 26:44.880
He's not here.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.021
Dextrolysergamide.

26:56.280 --> 26:57.986
If this is from today,

26:58.070 --> 27:00.231
then Wythe
has activated another killer.

27:09.210 --> 27:10.575
Hey, boss, I got
a BOLO out on Wythe.

27:10.710 --> 27:13.668
Got his picture
circulating in every airport,
train station, and bridge.

27:13.750 --> 27:16.878
Great, but right now
we need to focus on tracking
down this possible shooter.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.547
Oh, with no ID,
no description,
no potential target?

27:19.680 --> 27:21.420
I mean, we're good, boss,
but we can't find a ghost.

27:21.550 --> 27:23.757
What about potential targets
in town yesterday?

27:23.890 --> 27:25.460
They sent Eli
out to get someone.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.595
Me and Denny
looked into it,

27:26.720 --> 27:29.132
but there wasn't anyone
within five miles
of that power plant.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.800
DENNY:
Hey, I think I found a link

27:30.900 --> 27:32.344
between the shootings
of Congressman Hill

27:32.440 --> 27:34.567
and that journalist
in Virginia.
Jeff Brooks, right?

27:35.020 --> 27:38.239
Killed in Virginia
while investigating a story
about a potential scandal

27:38.360 --> 27:41.067
involving our
government selling
weapons to Syrian rebels.

27:41.570 --> 27:43.982
I never heard of that.
Yeah. Because it
never came out.

27:44.080 --> 27:45.570
The story got discredited
after Brooks died,

27:45.660 --> 27:46.729
and it never
gained traction.

27:46.870 --> 27:48.940
Then a few months later,
a House Oversight Committee

27:49.080 --> 27:50.206
opens an investigation.

27:50.290 --> 27:52.281
And Congressman Hill
was on that committee.

27:52.540 --> 27:54.451
He chaired
that committee.

27:55.290 --> 27:57.588
So Wythe and his goons
could be taking out anyone

27:57.670 --> 27:59.911
looking into this
arms scandal.

28:00.010 --> 28:00.999
What happened
to the inquiry?

28:01.090 --> 28:04.503
Well, it went away after
Congressman Hill had to
retire due to his injuries.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.386
However, two weeks ago,

28:06.470 --> 28:08.381
there's a resolution
proposed in the Senate

28:08.470 --> 28:11.519
to establish a committee
to investigate
these same allegations.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.340
Who proposed
this resolution?

28:13.770 --> 28:15.431
Senator Glass from Indiana.

28:15.520 --> 28:18.273
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Senator Alison Glass?

28:18.400 --> 28:19.355
Right.

28:19.440 --> 28:20.600
Her _name came
up in a search

28:20.740 --> 28:22.389
of potential political targets
in town yesterday.

28:22.490 --> 28:24.367
That's right.
She was giving a speech
up in Harlem.

28:24.450 --> 28:25.769
She still here?

28:27.700 --> 28:28.689
Holy crap, boss,

28:28.790 --> 28:31.452
she's set to appear
at the new green energy
building on Roosevelt Island.

28:31.540 --> 28:33.451
Guys, that's across the street
from yesterday's shooting.

28:33.540 --> 28:36.623
Eli would have had
the perfect vantage point
from that power plant.

28:36.710 --> 28:38.541
Senator Glass
is our target.

28:38.630 --> 28:41.337
So Eli got the location right,
but the date wrong?

28:41.470 --> 28:43.677
Eli's wife said he
had a bike accident,

28:43.800 --> 28:46.007
hit his head the day
before the shooting.

28:46.140 --> 28:49.212
Maybe it scrambled the program
being uploaded into his brain.

28:49.310 --> 28:50.345
Come on, Al.

28:50.470 --> 28:51.596
That's a little
far

28:51.680 --> 28:53.932
No more so than
the rest of this.

28:54.020 --> 28:56.181
We need to cancel
the senator's appearance

28:56.310 --> 28:59.643
before somebody else
gets a phone call
that turns them into a killer.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.810
You gonna take on
a senator, boss?

29:01.900 --> 29:03.276
You got that
kind of pull?

29:03.360 --> 29:05.157
I got friends
in low places.

29:06.200 --> 29:07.155
Let's do it.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.657
I was, uh, surprised
to get your call.

29:12.830 --> 29:14.366
How's _retirement
treating you?

29:14.500 --> 29:18.379
It's good. I got a lot
of extra time, and I'm
catching up on reading.

29:18.500 --> 29:19.876
I'm thinking of
learning French.

29:20.670 --> 29:21.830
Parlez

29:21.920 --> 29:23.660
I'm growing a garden.
Growing kale.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.836
Kale? Sounds great.
Yeah.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.676
It's horrible.
I'm losing my mind.

29:30.350 --> 29:31.806
I'm a cop.

29:31.890 --> 29:33.300
Cops don't grow kale.

29:33.390 --> 29:35.551
We're working on
getting you re-instated.

29:35.690 --> 29:37.226
Should get word
in a day or two.

29:38.520 --> 29:41.148
In the meantime,
if you're interested,

29:41.860 --> 29:44.101
I can use a little help...
I'll do it.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.867
HALEY: So you're asking me to
cancel the senator's event,

29:49.990 --> 29:51.537
which the media's
gonna be all over,

29:51.660 --> 29:53.241
for some crackpot
conspiracy theory?

29:53.370 --> 29:54.826
Yeah, I mean,
I know it sounds out there,

29:54.910 --> 29:55.911
but we have
reason to believe

29:56.040 --> 29:57.871
that the senator's life
could be in danger.

29:58.290 --> 30:02.374
There was a shooting
at the factory next door
to your event yesterday.

30:03.050 --> 30:04.506
Come on, Haley.
You're her Chief of Staff.

30:04.590 --> 30:06.046
You need to be
looking out for her.

30:06.130 --> 30:07.711
It's pretty
thin, Sandra,

30:07.800 --> 30:10.212
and I hate to remind you,
but you're not a cop anymore.

30:10.300 --> 30:11.847
Oh, all right.

30:12.260 --> 30:14.057
Well, I hate to remind you

30:14.180 --> 30:16.978
that I know about
the senator's trip to
Park City last year

30:17.060 --> 30:18.891
when she was
supposed to be at...
Blackmail?

30:19.270 --> 30:20.476
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

30:21.400 --> 30:22.640
Her life could
be in danger.

30:24.150 --> 30:25.777
Can you give me
a name of the suspect,

30:25.900 --> 30:27.231
a description, anything?

30:27.360 --> 30:28.736
Right now, the killer
could be anyone.

30:28.820 --> 30:29.866
That's our MO, but we...

30:29.950 --> 30:32.157
Find me a suspect,
I'll reconsider.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.240
All right.

30:47.090 --> 30:49.217
Sandra struck out with
the senator's people.

30:49.300 --> 30:50.927
They didn't think
it was a credible threat.

30:51.550 --> 30:52.847
What do you got there?

30:52.930 --> 30:55.888
Nothing. I'm going over
security footage from the
Ardmore building today.

30:55.980 --> 30:58.266
If your theory is right

30:58.390 --> 31:02.394
and Wythe activated a killer
to go after the senator, well,

31:03.270 --> 31:05.272
I thought if I go
through the footage,
I might see something

31:05.360 --> 31:07.567
that'll be useful when we're
at the event later today.

31:07.650 --> 31:10.949
Yeah, you really
think it's a good idea
for you to go to the event?

31:11.030 --> 31:13.407
I mean, with
everything going on,

31:13.490 --> 31:14.946
your connection to Eli...

31:15.790 --> 31:16.939
Al...

31:17.910 --> 31:19.070
Back off.

31:19.580 --> 31:22.458
I'm quite capable
of doing my job.
You know me.

31:23.420 --> 31:24.580
Okay.

31:26.300 --> 31:27.585
Shit.

31:33.720 --> 31:36.132
Come on. No, don't.

31:40.730 --> 31:42.300
Oh, my God.

31:43.480 --> 31:44.640
Oh, my God.

31:45.610 --> 31:46.645
Look”.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.982
I know you're under
a lot of stress.

31:49.110 --> 31:50.646
Al, I have to tell
you something.
I have...

31:53.280 --> 31:54.736
Hello?

31:55.120 --> 31:57.361
MAN: Six in a row.
Way to go.

31:58.580 --> 32:00.457
Got it. Thanks.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.365
What was that?

32:02.670 --> 32:04.035
Personal.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.085
You know, you're right.

32:10.300 --> 32:12.677
I don't think I should be
at the senator's event today.

32:13.340 --> 32:14.341
Okay.

32:15.720 --> 32:16.880
You were gonna
tell me something?

32:17.010 --> 32:18.011
No.

32:20.350 --> 32:21.681
I need a minute.

32:28.860 --> 32:31.351
I got unis posted in every
building near the event,

32:31.490 --> 32:34.027
doubled up Senator Glass's
security presence.

32:34.490 --> 32:35.559
I'm heading down there.

32:35.700 --> 32:38.237
Let me know
if you find anything on
Fenton or Wythe.

32:38.370 --> 32:39.655
You got it, boss.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.495
Where'd Carrie go?

32:44.210 --> 32:45.700
JAY LEE: She was just
there a few minutes ago.

33:09.530 --> 33:10.895
Holy shit.

33:16.990 --> 33:18.571
Zone six is clear.
Hey.

33:18.660 --> 33:20.036
Hey, restricted area.

33:20.120 --> 33:22.998
Oh, not for me,
Officer Sanford.

33:24.580 --> 33:26.536
Okay, Detective.
Yeah, thanks.

34:23.350 --> 34:25.136
Anything to report?
OFFICER: No, it's quiet.

34:25.270 --> 34:26.635
Get an ID
on the shooter yet?

34:27.810 --> 34:29.050
Nothing.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.970
CARRIE:
Zone six is clear.

34:32.610 --> 34:33.679
Where's zone six?

34:33.820 --> 34:34.809
In the power plant.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.752
AL:
Carrie, you there? Come in.

34:56.130 --> 34:57.336
Carrie?

35:34.460 --> 35:36.200
Hey, I already
checked in there.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.621
It's clear.
Check the north side
of the building.

35:53.650 --> 35:55.311
Carrie, drop the gun.

36:01.820 --> 36:03.060
It's me, Al.

36:03.950 --> 36:05.019
Don't do this.

36:05.910 --> 36:07.730
Six in a row.
Way to go.

36:14.750 --> 36:16.798
Listen. Listen, Carrie!
No!

36:16.920 --> 36:18.410
You were never
at a carnival.

36:18.550 --> 36:19.756
That memory
is not real.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.836
They planted it
in your mind.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.830
I need you to
remember what's real.

36:23.930 --> 36:26.091
You can do it.

36:26.180 --> 36:27.306
I know you can.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.597
You're stronger than
whatever they did to you.

36:30.730 --> 36:33.096
Come back.
Come back to me.

36:35.610 --> 36:37.931
Six in a row.
Way to go!

36:38.030 --> 36:41.352
Six... six...
SIX in a row.
Way to go!

36:42.490 --> 36:43.525
Come back.

36:51.580 --> 36:53.161
WYTHE:
By rewiring their brains

36:53.290 --> 36:55.622
through a combination
of hypnosis, drugs,

36:55.750 --> 36:57.832
and shock therapy,

36:57.960 --> 37:00.508
I've been able
to force these people
to remember things

37:00.630 --> 37:03.121
that they've never
even experienced

37:03.260 --> 37:06.297
and even more importantly,
do whatever I like.

37:10.100 --> 37:12.477
Six in a row.
Way to go!

37:15.770 --> 37:18.432
Do they know
what's happening right now?
Are we safe?

37:18.520 --> 37:20.021
Well, I've conditioned
them to believe

37:20.150 --> 37:22.436
that they're spending
their evening at a carnival.

37:22.530 --> 37:26.648
They will have no recollection
whatsoever of anything
that goes on here tonight.

37:27.030 --> 37:28.327
You're certain?

37:28.410 --> 37:30.537
We'll go down
if one of them
remembers this.

37:31.830 --> 37:34.822
I'm certain,
and if they do,
we can make more.

37:37.170 --> 37:40.662
In a few hours, I will release
them back to their lives

37:40.800 --> 37:44.418
blissfully unaware
that they have been
weaponized here tonight.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.296
When we have a mission,

37:46.390 --> 37:48.005
I will call one
of them back,

37:48.100 --> 37:51.968
upload the target,
_ and activate them
With a Simple phone call.

37:52.640 --> 37:53.971
Why these people?

37:54.060 --> 37:55.516
Well, you tell me, Fenton.

37:55.600 --> 37:59.855
What do security guards,
and lawyers,

37:59.980 --> 38:02.221
stadium workers,
police officers,

38:02.360 --> 38:04.601
federal agents,
journalists,

38:04.700 --> 38:06.144
what do they all
have in common?

38:06.610 --> 38:09.158
Trust and familiarity.

38:09.830 --> 38:11.274
Nobody will suspect them.

38:11.370 --> 38:12.359
Exactly.

38:14.160 --> 38:15.570
Take this beauty,

38:15.710 --> 38:18.201
Carrie Wells,
former detective.

38:18.710 --> 38:20.450
She has a perfect memory.

38:22.050 --> 38:23.199
Now...

38:24.720 --> 38:30.135
Imagine the possibilities
of a memory capacity so large.

38:30.470 --> 38:32.051
Drugging people
is one thing.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.631
Controlling them
is quite another.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.722
Perhaps you need
a further demonstration.

38:40.610 --> 38:43.067
Six in a row.
Way to go!

38:43.190 --> 38:44.680
Carrie,

38:46.820 --> 38:49.357
There's a weapon
on the table behind you.

38:49.700 --> 38:52.271
Would you kill this man,
Brian Fenton?

39:01.920 --> 39:03.660
Call her off, Wythe.

39:05.590 --> 39:07.217
Call her off!

39:10.550 --> 39:12.256
Thank you, Carrie.

39:12.390 --> 39:14.255
Have a seat.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.760
The perfect killer,

39:20.900 --> 39:23.050
stripped of
conscience and morality.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.776
We will build an
army so secret

39:25.860 --> 39:28.567
that not even the soldiers
will know they've enlisted.

39:33.620 --> 39:34.609
Oh...

39:36.660 --> 39:38.287
Oh, my God.

39:39.540 --> 39:41.246
The senator, did I...
No, no, no.

39:41.330 --> 39:43.127
You figured it out first.

39:43.210 --> 39:45.166
Thank God.
How did you find me?

39:45.300 --> 39:47.040
I followed you.

39:47.130 --> 39:49.166
How did you...
I know my girl.

39:49.300 --> 39:50.756
The second you
got that phone call,

39:50.840 --> 39:52.421
I knew something
was wrong.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.676
You didn't look
like you anymore.

39:55.350 --> 39:56.760
You're back.

40:00.140 --> 40:02.392
_ MAN:
Lieutenant Burns,
do you copy?

40:09.070 --> 40:10.856
This is Lieutenant Burns.

40:10.990 --> 40:12.400
The power
plant is clear.

40:12.490 --> 40:13.980
You can stand down.

40:14.070 --> 40:15.617
All right,
let's get out of here.

40:19.790 --> 40:22.827
You know, we're still
gonna have to track down
Wythe and Fenton.

40:22.960 --> 40:24.370
You gonna be up for it?

40:24.500 --> 40:25.831
CARRIE: Is the Pope Catholic?

40:27.090 --> 40:29.547
Had I known you were
susceptible to mind control,

40:29.670 --> 40:31.376
I would have
tried it years ago.

40:31.510 --> 40:33.671
Oh, yeah?
Would you use it for
good or for evil?

40:33.800 --> 40:35.506
Ah...define evil.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.421
Hey, Al?
Hmm?

40:41.480 --> 40:42.686
I'm sorry.

40:44.190 --> 40:48.012
When I said I didn't
need you to protect me, I...

40:48.610 --> 40:49.895
I was just, I...

40:50.030 --> 40:51.395
I do need you.
I do.

40:51.530 --> 40:53.907
I need you
all the time.

40:55.910 --> 40:57.730
The day you walked
back into my life

40:57.870 --> 40:59.406
Technically, you walked
back into mine,

40:59.540 --> 41:00.529
my little
apartment in Queens.

41:00.660 --> 41:02.787
5:00 am, you were
pounding on the door,
boom, boom, boom.

41:02.870 --> 41:04.030
It was a gentle knock.

41:04.120 --> 41:07.374
And I said, "Hey, you
don't have to break it down.
I hear you."

41:08.420 --> 41:10.206
Nice to see you too.

41:16.930 --> 41:18.215
I love you.

41:18.310 --> 41:19.299
What?

41:19.390 --> 41:21.346
Yeah, I know.

41:21.430 --> 41:22.636
It scares you.

41:22.730 --> 41:24.129
I don't care.

41:24.230 --> 41:25.549
It's the truth.

41:26.980 --> 41:28.356
I love you.

41:29.360 --> 41:31.737
Always have, always will.

41:42.580 --> 41:44.457
Wow, that's, um...

41:45.920 --> 41:49.629
You know, I never thought
I would be brave enough
to go down this path again

41:49.750 --> 41:50.910
or admit this, but I...

42:00.010 --> 42:01.250
Al?

42:01.350 --> 42:03.136
Al! Al?

42:03.600 --> 42:06.262
Al, look at me!
Al, I need you!
Stay awake.

42:06.390 --> 42:07.846
Okay, just...no!
Keep your eyes open!

42:08.150 --> 42:10.266
Al, no, come on.
Come on!

42:10.400 --> 42:13.278
Al! Get me an ambulance!

42:13.440 --> 42:15.943
Al? Stay awake.
Stay awake.

42:16.070 --> 42:17.480
No, no, no, no, no.

42:17.860 --> 42:19.441
Al, no, come on.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.611
Oh, my God.
