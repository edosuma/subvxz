00:23.295 --> 00:25.684
8:30, Biography.

00:25.719 --> 00:28.447
Oh, they're doing George Clooney.

00:28.482 --> 00:31.979
If I were 10 years younger,
I'd be all over that man.

00:32.014 --> 00:36.805
Oh, uh, Sex and the City.

00:36.840 --> 00:38.744
I don't think so. No.

00:38.779 --> 00:41.704
You're too young to be watching that one.

00:41.739 --> 00:43.603
I think.

00:43.638 --> 00:47.588
You know, I don't even know
how old you are.

00:47.968 --> 00:52.712
If nobody claims you by next week,
I'm adopting you.

00:52.747 --> 00:55.162
Would you like that? Hmm?

00:57.437 --> 01:00.315
Shut up! Shut up!

01:01.768 --> 01:05.174
- Throw that over her.
- I'm trying!

01:08.259 --> 01:09.849
Hey.! Hey, what are you doing?

01:09.884 --> 01:10.497
Careful. - Nana!

01:10.532 --> 01:12.746
Be careful.! - Nana?

01:12.781 --> 01:17.215
Nana.! Nana.!
What are you doing?

01:17.240 --> 01:19.743
Hey, stop! Nana!

01:19.778 --> 01:22.572
What... Help! Somebody!

01:23.047 --> 01:25.712
MONK Season 2 Epi. 13
Mr. Monk and the Missing Granny

02:23.455 --> 02:24.893
A lightning bolt.

02:24.928 --> 02:26.684
Well, we think it's a calling card.

02:26.719 --> 02:29.335
There was a radical group
in the early '70s.

02:29.370 --> 02:30.731
The Lightning Brigade?

02:30.766 --> 02:32.315
They were involved in some
R. O. T. C. Bombings...

02:32.350 --> 02:35.016
I know who the Lightning Brigade was,
Lieutenant.

02:35.051 --> 02:37.380
I remember the '70s.

02:37.415 --> 02:39.490
At least some of it.

02:39.525 --> 02:40.800
You okay?

02:41.429 --> 02:43.362
They have a cat. I'm allergic to cats.

02:43.397 --> 02:46.601
Okay, we've got two short hours
before this phone call.

02:46.636 --> 02:47.823
Are we ready?

02:47.858 --> 02:49.206
Yeah, we're all set, Captain.

02:49.241 --> 02:50.653
We've got two recorders ready to roll,

02:50.688 --> 02:53.444
and the phone company's online
for an immediate track and trace.

02:53.479 --> 02:54.608
How long do we need?

02:54.643 --> 02:57.190
Well, if it's a land line, we've got 'em.

02:57.225 --> 02:59.081
- If it's a cell phone...
- Which it will be.

02:59.116 --> 03:01.259
We'll need 45 seconds.

03:01.294 --> 03:02.948
Excuse me. Captain Stottlemeyer?

03:02.983 --> 03:04.660
Hello. I'm Julie Parlo.

03:04.695 --> 03:06.891
Uh, where is the F. B. I.?

03:06.926 --> 03:08.417
This is a kidnapping.

03:08.452 --> 03:09.687
I happen to be a lawyer,

03:09.722 --> 03:13.544
so I know in a kidnapping situation
the F. B. I. has jurisprudence.

03:13.579 --> 03:16.879
That's only true if your grandmother's
been taken across the state lines.

03:16.914 --> 03:18.878
Or if she's been held
for more than 24 hours.

03:18.913 --> 03:22.019
And I think you meant to say
"jurisdiction," right?

03:22.225 --> 03:23.734
What kind of lawyer are you?

03:23.769 --> 03:27.726
- Oh, uh, I never said I was a lawyer.
- Yes, you did.

03:27.761 --> 03:30.748
I-I'm a law student at Garland College,

03:30.783 --> 03:32.741
and I know that I have certain rights.

03:32.776 --> 03:35.344
And if you don't do everything
you can to get my grandmother back,

03:35.379 --> 03:37.754
I could sue you all for malpractice.

03:37.789 --> 03:39.146
No, you can't.

03:39.181 --> 03:40.340
I-I can't?

03:40.375 --> 03:41.658
No.

03:41.693 --> 03:45.345
Miss Parlo, you live here
with your grandmother, right?

03:45.380 --> 03:47.812
Yeah. I moved in after
both my parents died.

03:47.847 --> 03:49.640
That was four years ago.

03:49.675 --> 03:52.531
- So it's just the two of you?
- Oh, yes, sir.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.488
Well, and the cat.

03:55.108 --> 03:57.607
Yeah, I know about the cat.

03:57.642 --> 03:59.426
Is your grandmother wealthy?

03:59.461 --> 04:01.890
No. That's why this doesn't
make any sense.

04:01.925 --> 04:05.575
Why Nana? She... She's 76 years old,
she's not rich,

04:05.610 --> 04:07.582
she doesn't have an enemy in the world,

04:07.617 --> 04:10.382
and she's out there somewhere
right now scared to death.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.597
Captain, you've gotta do something.

04:12.632 --> 04:15.191
What about, um, that detective
I was reading about?

04:15.226 --> 04:16.798
Uh, the-the monk?

04:16.833 --> 04:19.033
Monk. His name is Monk.

04:19.067 --> 04:20.887
Yeah, I read an article about him.

04:20.922 --> 04:23.444
Um, they quoted you.
You said he was brilliant.

04:23.479 --> 04:27.784
Yeah, um, Adrian Monk is
a former homicide detective

04:27.819 --> 04:31.689
who we use on a consulting basis
from time to time once we've hit a wall.

04:31.724 --> 04:36.009
But we haven't hit a wall, Miss Parlo.
Everything is under control.

04:38.063 --> 04:39.544
Sorry.

04:41.125 --> 04:43.124
Careful.

04:43.694 --> 04:45.443
Slowly.

04:48.257 --> 04:50.376
Concentrate.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.510
Be the dotted line.

05:08.254 --> 05:09.696
Oh!

05:12.779 --> 05:15.002
Come in. It's open.

05:18.677 --> 05:21.046
Adrian Monk?

05:21.666 --> 05:22.933
You're not Sharona.

05:22.968 --> 05:26.839
No, sir. Um, my name's Julie Parlo.

05:26.874 --> 05:29.977
I need your help. Uh...

05:30.012 --> 05:31.839
It's my grandmother.

05:31.874 --> 05:34.474
She's been kidnapped.

05:37.892 --> 05:39.353
Thank you.

05:43.608 --> 05:45.247
Uh...

05:58.902 --> 06:00.567
Okay, there.

06:02.364 --> 06:07.135
Okay. We'll just keep it right there
if you need it again.

06:07.461 --> 06:12.953
Um, Mr. Monk, you're a private
consultant now, right?

06:12.988 --> 06:15.910
Okay, 'cause, um, I want to hire you.

06:15.945 --> 06:18.720
There's just one thing.
Uh, I can't pay you.

06:18.755 --> 06:21.472
Well, that's... that's a problem.

06:21.507 --> 06:26.114
My assistant, Sharona, won't let me
take any more cases for free.

06:26.149 --> 06:28.521
Doesn't she work for you?

06:28.556 --> 06:32.572
Well, it's complicated.

06:32.607 --> 06:34.772
Here's the thing.
I don't have any money,

06:34.807 --> 06:37.537
but I can pay you in trade.

06:37.572 --> 06:40.525
Um, if you help me, I can help you.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.961
What are we...
What are we talking about here?

06:42.996 --> 06:45.791
I can get you reinstated.

06:45.826 --> 06:47.751
Reinstated?

06:47.786 --> 06:50.391
I know you want your badge back
more than anything,

06:50.426 --> 06:54.037
and I already talked to Professor
Emory about your situation.

06:54.072 --> 06:57.361
Professor Em... Eugene Emory?

06:57.396 --> 06:58.781
At Garland College?

06:58.816 --> 07:00.856
That's right. I'm in his class.

07:00.891 --> 07:05.248
Oh, my God! I just read his book.

07:05.283 --> 07:07.987
Oh, yeah. We have a test
on that next week.

07:08.022 --> 07:10.681
It... It's wonderful.

07:11.113 --> 07:12.658
What's it about?

07:12.693 --> 07:16.252
Oh, well, it's an argument for tort reform.

07:16.287 --> 07:19.870
Professor Emory feels that we could
eliminate all superfluous litigation

07:19.905 --> 07:26.099
if we cap punitive damages and hold the
plaintiff liable for any court expenses.

07:30.111 --> 07:35.582
Well, I'm sure you could get out of
the test because your grandmother...

07:35.617 --> 07:38.453
Right. Whew!

07:38.732 --> 07:44.602
But you... you did talk to Professor
Emory, to Eugene Emory about me?

07:44.637 --> 07:47.497
Yeah. He said he could definitely
get you reinstated.

07:47.532 --> 07:49.163
He guaranteed it.

07:49.198 --> 07:51.043
How?

07:51.215 --> 07:55.490
I'll tell you when my grandmother's
home safe and sound.

07:55.525 --> 07:57.043
Do we have a deal?

07:57.078 --> 08:05.033
Well, I... I could always call
Professor Emory myself.

08:06.221 --> 08:08.933
But I won't.

08:09.417 --> 08:10.953
She can get you reinstated?

08:10.988 --> 08:14.480
She talked to Eugene Emory,
the Pulitzer Prize winner.

08:14.515 --> 08:17.259
There's some sort of loophole in the law.

08:17.294 --> 08:20.175
It-It... It's too good to be true.

08:20.210 --> 08:21.969
Exactly.

08:23.705 --> 08:25.594
You okay?

08:26.058 --> 08:28.234
She has a cat.

08:28.269 --> 08:29.994
Well, why don't you tell her
to bring it upstairs?

08:30.029 --> 08:34.371
No. No. It doesn't matter.

08:34.407 --> 08:38.039
If a cat's been in a house in
the last year, I can't stop sneezing.

08:38.073 --> 08:39.932
Really?

08:39.967 --> 08:42.192
Remind me to buy a cat.

08:42.227 --> 08:43.544
Ooh.

08:43.919 --> 08:47.137
Well, at least you won't be alone
on Saturday nights.

08:47.172 --> 08:48.272
Is anybody hungry?

08:48.307 --> 08:50.537
I made these pastries
while we're waiting...

08:50.572 --> 08:54.026
- just to keep my mind off things.
- Oh, thanks.

08:54.808 --> 08:56.134
No.

08:58.852 --> 09:02.331
Mmm. Really good.

09:02.366 --> 09:04.939
Delicious. You could sell these.

09:04.974 --> 09:07.873
Actually, it's always been my dream
to open up my own bakery.

09:07.908 --> 09:09.248
So why are you in law school?

09:09.283 --> 09:11.680
Oh, well, that's what
my parents always wanted.

09:11.715 --> 09:15.479
So, uh, I used their life insurance
money to pay for the tuition.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.026
But if you're not happy...

09:17.061 --> 09:19.512
Well, you don't want to disappoint
your parents,

09:19.547 --> 09:21.056
even if they're not here.

09:21.091 --> 09:23.620
Well, especially if they're not here.

09:23.655 --> 09:25.527
I understand.

09:27.495 --> 09:29.399
Not a word.

09:29.434 --> 09:30.693
She's alone in the house.

09:30.728 --> 09:34.470
Now, nobody is in the room but her.

09:34.505 --> 09:38.793
Julie, we need 45 seconds, okay?
You can do it. - Okay.

09:40.060 --> 09:41.022
Hello.

09:41.057 --> 09:44.181
This is the Lightning Brigade.
All the power to the people.

09:44.216 --> 09:46.977
- Uh, okay.
- We have your grandmother.

09:47.012 --> 09:49.281
- Is she all right?
- She's fine.

09:49.316 --> 09:53.464
And if you want her to stay that way,
do exactly what we say.

09:53.499 --> 09:55.550
Don't try to keep us on the phone, Julie.

09:55.585 --> 09:56.599
We're not stupid.

09:56.634 --> 09:59.139
Um, well, okay,
but can I... can I talk to her?

09:59.174 --> 10:01.994
I said she's fine.
Don't you trust me?

10:02.029 --> 10:04.516
Yeah, but she has a heart condition.

10:04.551 --> 10:06.398
Um, she needs her medication.

10:06.433 --> 10:08.556
Then you'd better listen carefully.

10:08.591 --> 10:10.279
Here's what I need you to do.

10:10.314 --> 10:11.813
What?
Do you want me to hang up?

10:11.848 --> 10:13.370
Is that... Is that what you want?

10:13.405 --> 10:17.304
Who's there? You blew it, honey.

10:17.855 --> 10:20.863
Forty-one seconds.
We missed him.

10:21.292 --> 10:24.672
She had something on her cheek.

10:31.605 --> 10:34.854
- Do you think they'll call again?
- I don't think so.

10:36.104 --> 10:38.497
Sharona, watch him.

10:39.596 --> 10:43.193
Um, that wasn't the police.
I'm just really nervous, okay? I swear.

10:43.228 --> 10:44.676
Don't be nervous.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.367
Here's what we need you to do.

10:46.402 --> 10:49.583
There are hundreds of homeless
people in the Mission District.

10:49.618 --> 10:51.276
They suffer needlessly
while just blocks away

10:51.311 --> 10:54.525
the rich stuff their fat faces
in fancy restaurants.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.283
Okay, we're... we're not rich.

10:56.318 --> 10:57.948
Shut up and listen!

10:57.983 --> 11:00.150
Tonight we're redistributing the wealth.

11:00.185 --> 11:04.555
I want you to buy every homeless person
in the Mission District a turkey dinner.

11:04.590 --> 11:06.021
A turk... turkey dinner?

11:06.056 --> 11:07.635
Just do it,

11:07.670 --> 11:10.253
and Grandma will be
home before you know it.

11:10.288 --> 11:12.614
Okay, well, what time...

11:14.639 --> 11:16.715
She didn't get it.

11:21.308 --> 11:25.150
They want turkey dinners for all the
homeless people in the Mission District.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.559
What the hell is going on?

11:29.753 --> 11:32.908
This is crazy.
What kind of ransom demand is this?

11:32.943 --> 11:38.733
I know. The kidnappers are risking life
in prison for what $500 worth of food?

11:38.768 --> 11:42.270
I mean, the shelter on Third is
serving turkey tonight anyway.

11:42.305 --> 11:44.811
Well, we can't stand around here like this.

11:44.846 --> 11:46.675
We don't exactly blend in.

11:46.710 --> 11:48.944
Do you have a suggestion?

11:49.201 --> 11:50.535
This is crazy.

11:50.570 --> 11:53.394
It doesn't matter.
I'm getting my badge back.

11:53.429 --> 11:55.067
I'll believe that when I see it.

11:55.102 --> 11:58.943
Julie Parlo didn't exactly seem like
Supreme Court material.

11:58.978 --> 12:00.836
- Gravy?
- No, thanks.

12:00.871 --> 12:03.746
Everyone else is having gravy.

12:03.781 --> 12:05.075
I don't like it.

12:05.110 --> 12:07.971
Why don't you have a little gravy?

12:08.006 --> 12:09.447
He doesn't want any gravy.

12:09.482 --> 12:11.574
I think the gentleman can speak
for himself. Sir?

12:11.609 --> 12:13.238
I don't want any gravy.

12:13.273 --> 12:15.083
Okay. Sure.

12:15.118 --> 12:17.632
Enjoy your meal.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.495
Oh, my God!

12:19.530 --> 12:22.213
- What are you supposed to be?
- I'm undercover.

12:22.248 --> 12:23.621
I'm homeless.

12:23.656 --> 12:27.761
- What's that on your face?
- Dirt.

12:28.546 --> 12:31.453
Give the lady some gravy.

12:33.118 --> 12:35.436
Here it is.

12:35.471 --> 12:37.230
I don't want it.

12:37.265 --> 12:39.189
Didn't you just ask for gravy?

12:39.224 --> 12:40.949
I didn't say anything.

12:40.984 --> 12:44.867
Oh. Well, here it is.

12:45.364 --> 12:49.546
I told you.
I don't want it.

12:49.581 --> 12:52.723
Okay, how about this then?

12:52.758 --> 12:56.311
You have some gravy...

12:58.266 --> 13:00.232
And?

13:00.267 --> 13:01.589
That's it.

13:03.476 --> 13:05.043
We got her.

13:05.078 --> 13:06.092
We got her back.

13:06.127 --> 13:07.978
They dropped her off two blocks away.

13:08.013 --> 13:09.799
Call E. M. S.!

13:11.102 --> 13:12.863
It's me.

13:14.617 --> 13:16.482
How's Grandma Parlo doing?

13:16.517 --> 13:17.951
Oh, she's a tough old bird.

13:17.986 --> 13:19.655
But she can't I. D.
The kidnappers?

13:19.690 --> 13:21.268
Blindfolded the whole time.

13:21.303 --> 13:24.335
But she thinks she's heard
their voices before.

13:24.370 --> 13:25.924
She just can't remember where.

13:25.959 --> 13:27.293
Well, at least they didn't hurt her.

13:27.328 --> 13:29.298
No. She was treated pretty well,
considering.

13:29.333 --> 13:32.978
They even kept saying "Be careful"
when they carried her out of the house.

13:33.013 --> 13:36.093
Yeah, they fed her pizza.
All the pizza she could eat.

13:36.128 --> 13:38.786
I can't even get pizza at my house.

13:38.821 --> 13:41.267
Get this. They played opera.

13:41.302 --> 13:43.806
The old lady says she could hear
it through the door.

13:43.841 --> 13:45.822
The kidnappers are into opera.

13:45.857 --> 13:48.073
What kind of revolution is this?

13:48.108 --> 13:49.866
We're about to find out.

13:49.901 --> 13:52.890
We picked up Ron Abrash this morning.

13:52.925 --> 13:55.763
He was the leader of the
Lightning Brigade 30 years ago.

13:55.798 --> 13:57.792
He's in the box now.

13:57.827 --> 13:59.796
You want to sit in?

14:00.660 --> 14:05.258
- You're asking me to sit in?
- Yeah.

14:06.450 --> 14:08.791
I heard you might be getting
your badge back.

14:08.826 --> 14:10.357
It'd be good practice for you.

14:10.392 --> 14:11.841
Thanks.

14:13.223 --> 14:14.709
I'm going in.

14:14.744 --> 14:16.823
Okay. Cool.

14:16.858 --> 14:21.654
It'll be the three of us. We can do
good cop, bad cop, worse cop.

14:21.689 --> 14:24.974
Randy, it's a two-man job.
Just wait here.

14:25.522 --> 14:27.786
Oh, okay. I'll just wait here and...

14:27.821 --> 14:30.111
Weep openly.

14:30.666 --> 14:32.646
Do some paperwork.

14:32.681 --> 14:36.010
While you weep openly.

14:38.932 --> 14:40.416
Head inside.

14:40.710 --> 14:42.281
Don't you people read the papers?

14:42.316 --> 14:44.579
The Brigade is ancient history.

14:44.614 --> 14:47.750
We broke up like 25 years ago.

14:47.785 --> 14:50.960
Besides, all we cared about was the war.

14:50.995 --> 14:52.904
Remember the war?

14:52.939 --> 14:54.991
Yeah, I remember the war.

14:55.026 --> 14:57.610
I had a brother over there.

14:57.645 --> 15:00.915
So you're denying any involvement
in the kidnapping of Mrs. Parlo?

15:00.950 --> 15:02.483
Of course I deny it.

15:02.518 --> 15:06.326
Demanding free turkey dinners?
That's insane.

15:06.361 --> 15:08.235
Besides, I'm a vegan.

15:08.270 --> 15:11.548
All right, Ronnie. Where were you
yesterday at 7:30 in the morning?

15:11.583 --> 15:13.644
I was in my classroom.

15:13.679 --> 15:18.300
I teach graduate level English
and screenwriting at Berkeley.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.371
Call them. Check it out.

15:20.406 --> 15:22.873
The most radical thing I do these days

15:22.908 --> 15:26.497
is give the finger to jerks driving SUVs.

15:26.532 --> 15:28.494
All right. Maybe it wasn't you.

15:28.529 --> 15:31.878
Maybe it was some of your old playmates
trying to relive their glory days.

15:31.913 --> 15:34.898
Maybe they missed the buzz.

15:40.013 --> 15:42.465
You look familiar, Ronnie.

15:42.500 --> 15:46.142
Didn't I see you last week at the opera?

15:46.177 --> 15:48.510
The opera?

15:48.750 --> 15:52.087
What have you been smoking, man?

15:52.805 --> 15:56.806
I've been smoking the truth, man!

16:00.706 --> 16:05.871
What are you guys doing...
good cop, crazy cop?

16:15.170 --> 16:18.418
Ronnie, could you roll up
your left sleeve?

16:19.791 --> 16:21.682
All right. So I still have the tattoo.

16:21.717 --> 16:23.502
It doesn't mean anything.

16:23.537 --> 16:26.186
It's like having an old girlfriend's
name on your arm.

16:26.221 --> 16:28.328
It doesn't mean you still love her.

16:28.363 --> 16:31.166
That lightning bolt has three jags.

16:31.201 --> 16:35.861
That's right.
Resist, revolt, reform.

16:36.377 --> 16:38.989
That was our motto.

16:40.098 --> 16:44.141
Captain, can I talk to you for a second?

16:47.341 --> 16:49.346
Captain,

16:49.724 --> 16:52.710
I don't think it was him or anybody
in his group.

16:52.745 --> 16:56.660
You heard him. Each of those
three jags means something.

16:56.695 --> 16:59.189
Any real member of the Brigade
would have known that.

16:59.224 --> 17:02.253
But... look...

17:02.705 --> 17:05.974
look what was painted
on Mrs. Parlo's wall.

17:06.010 --> 17:08.059
Two jags.

17:08.459 --> 17:10.468
How'd you know he had a tattoo on his arm?

17:10.502 --> 17:11.816
Oh, uh, I didn't.

17:11.851 --> 17:13.733
His other sleeve was rolled up.

17:13.769 --> 17:16.548
- It wasn't even.
- Exactly.

17:16.733 --> 17:19.520
I don't think this was
about politics at all.

17:19.555 --> 17:21.911
There is something else going on here.

17:21.945 --> 17:23.641
Well, you knock yourself out, Monk.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.884
As far as we're concerned,
this is on the back burner.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.566
It wasn't exactly the crime of the century.

17:28.601 --> 17:31.511
"Turkey for the people. Right on."

17:35.867 --> 17:37.045
Hey. - Hi.

17:37.080 --> 17:42.031
I'll bring the car around,
and you'll be home in half an hour.

17:44.569 --> 17:47.783
Julie. Julie, what is it?

17:47.818 --> 17:50.436
I never should've left you alone.
I should've been there.

17:50.471 --> 17:55.109
Oh, honey.
This is not your fault.

17:55.144 --> 18:00.538
I should have stabbed him in his
particulars when I had the chance.

18:00.573 --> 18:03.301
What would I do if anything ever
happened to you?

18:03.336 --> 18:09.277
You would have had a brilliant,
rich, full life.

18:09.312 --> 18:12.236
You would have met a man,

18:12.271 --> 18:14.480
had children,

18:14.515 --> 18:17.588
and you'd name one after me.

18:17.623 --> 18:24.208
And then open up that bakery
you're always going on about.

18:24.243 --> 18:26.466
That's all I was thinking about

18:26.501 --> 18:30.344
when I was locked up in that horrible room.

18:30.379 --> 18:33.774
So you've gotta be home by 5:00, okay?
Oh, hi, Julie.

18:33.809 --> 18:36.343
- Oh, hey. Nana, this is Sharona Fleming.
- Okay. I've gotta go.

18:36.378 --> 18:39.872
She works for Adrian Monk, the detective
I was telling you about.

18:39.907 --> 18:42.053
Yes. Oh, hi, Mrs. Parlo.
How are you feeling?

18:42.088 --> 18:44.521
Oh, a lot better. Tell me. Is it true?

18:44.556 --> 18:46.661
They said that they'd arrested a hippie

18:46.696 --> 18:49.518
that belonged to that group,
the Lightning Rods.

18:49.553 --> 18:51.334
Uh, yeah, the... the Lightning Brigade.

18:51.369 --> 18:54.945
I should have stabbed
him in his particulars.

18:54.980 --> 18:58.617
Well, actually my boss doesn't think
they were involved at all.

18:58.652 --> 19:00.633
He thinks somebody was framing them.

19:00.668 --> 19:04.053
Yeah. Uh, Jul... Julie,
can I just talk to you for a second?

19:04.088 --> 19:05.660
Oh, yeah. Nana, I'll be right there.

19:05.695 --> 19:11.389
Um, I just want to make sure that
you remember what you promised Adrian.

19:11.424 --> 19:12.965
You know, that if he helped you...

19:13.000 --> 19:15.287
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
About getting him reinstated.

19:15.322 --> 19:18.142
Yeah. Yeah, just, um, come by
the law school library tonight.

19:18.177 --> 19:20.821
I'll be there with my whole
study group. - Great. Great.

19:20.856 --> 19:23.639
Well, I just want to let you know that
he's really counting on this.

19:23.674 --> 19:26.355
It... It really means
a lot to him, you know?

19:26.390 --> 19:28.140
Look. I understand.
A deal's a deal.

19:28.175 --> 19:30.858
I mean, it's like we have a verbal...

19:30.893 --> 19:33.920
Uh, what's the word? Verbal... Ugh!
I'm drawing a blank.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.963
- Excuse me. Miss Parlo?
- Contract.

19:35.998 --> 19:39.461
That's it. - Miss Parlo?
Excuse me, Miss Parlo.

19:39.496 --> 19:42.039
Why do you think the Lightning Brigade
targeted your grandmother?

19:42.074 --> 19:43.696
Oh, we have no idea.

19:43.731 --> 19:45.511
Is she a political activist?

19:45.546 --> 19:46.813
An activist? No, no, no.

19:46.848 --> 19:48.366
My grandmother doesn't even vote.

19:48.401 --> 19:52.368
Besides, Adrian Monk, the most
respected detective in San Francisco,

19:52.403 --> 19:54.421
Doesn't even think the Brigade
is involved at all.

19:54.456 --> 19:56.448
The police don't seem to care
about the case at all.

19:56.483 --> 19:59.472
They're calling it a harmless prank.
Any comment?

19:59.507 --> 20:02.813
Well, Adrian Monk cares,
and he is not going to quit

20:02.848 --> 20:04.025
until he finds the people or

20:04.060 --> 20:07.731
peoples responsible for committing
this horrible crime.

20:07.766 --> 20:09.213
Thank you, Miss Parlo.

20:16.262 --> 20:20.581
Hey, guys. Uh, Adrian Monk.

20:20.616 --> 20:23.785
Um, Sharona Fleming.
This is my study group.

20:23.820 --> 20:25.199
- Edie Rusher.
- Hi.

20:25.234 --> 20:28.207
- Tom Burton and Sasha Gordon.
- Hi.

20:28.586 --> 20:30.994
Oh, are you studying in Spanish?

20:31.029 --> 20:34.867
Um, yeah. I'm taking
my next bar exam in Peru.

20:34.902 --> 20:36.355
It's all true and false down there.

20:36.390 --> 20:41.888
Doesn't that mean you'll only
be able to practice in Peru?

20:43.024 --> 20:44.640
Uh, geez.

20:44.675 --> 20:49.241
Do any of you have any professional
experience yet or...

20:49.276 --> 20:51.863
Oh, well, uh, we've done
a lot of pro bono work.

20:51.898 --> 20:55.108
Last year we assisted
in two death penalty cases:

20:55.143 --> 20:58.738
Sal Dickerson and Bill Jansen.

20:58.936 --> 21:03.681
Dickerson and Jansen?
Weren't they...

21:03.716 --> 21:06.360
I miss them every day.

21:06.395 --> 21:09.004
That's how you learn.
By making mistakes.

21:09.039 --> 21:11.955
Now we know if you're filing
a stay of execution,

21:11.990 --> 21:15.586
you have to take into account
daylight savings time.

21:16.274 --> 21:19.129
The law's hard, Mr. Monk.

21:19.164 --> 21:22.456
Look at all these books. Hmm?

21:22.491 --> 21:26.049
And there are more upstairs.

21:26.084 --> 21:28.719
Uh, about my reinstatement.

21:28.754 --> 21:33.201
You guys definitely talked in person to...

21:33.236 --> 21:36.172
to Professor Emory... Eugene Emory?

21:36.207 --> 21:38.025
Absolutely.

21:38.060 --> 21:40.340
These are his notes right here.

21:43.528 --> 21:47.146
Professor Emory said it can't fail.

21:49.795 --> 21:51.730
It can't fail.

21:52.130 --> 21:54.414
Okay, so here is the plan.

21:54.449 --> 22:00.452
We sue the police department
under Title 1, Section 102B.

22:02.503 --> 22:06.845
"The A. D. A. Prohibits discrimination
against a qualified individual

22:06.880 --> 22:10.910
in regard to hiring, advancement
or discharge of employees."

22:10.945 --> 22:12.138
The A. D. A.?

22:12.173 --> 22:14.310
Americans with Disabilities Act.

22:14.345 --> 22:17.514
- It's been the law since 1990.
- Disabilities?

22:17.549 --> 22:20.770
Well, lucky for you, all your phobias
and obsessive behavior

22:20.805 --> 22:22.224
have been well-documented,

22:22.259 --> 22:24.522
so you could have your badge back
as early as next week.

22:24.557 --> 22:26.803
All you have to do is take a test.

22:26.838 --> 22:31.125
No biggie. Just 20 or 30 questions
about department protocol.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.401
A mere formality.

22:32.436 --> 22:36.996
It's up to you.
Should I file this or not?

22:43.166 --> 22:47.669
Am I... disabled?

22:48.677 --> 22:52.475
Well, it's the only way.

22:52.510 --> 22:54.596
Right?

23:03.006 --> 23:06.461
Okay. Do it.

23:07.884 --> 23:10.617
Excuse me. Are you Adrian Monk?

23:10.652 --> 23:14.101
A man just gave me this note for you.

23:15.933 --> 23:19.520
Don't trust them.
Meet me upstairs-3rd floor. Come alone.

23:31.202 --> 23:33.679
Oh! I thought you were...

23:33.714 --> 23:35.718
The note said to come alone.

23:35.753 --> 23:39.225
Well, this is as alone as you're gonna get.

23:40.380 --> 23:41.725
Where is he?

23:41.760 --> 23:44.419
I don't know.

23:50.107 --> 23:52.862
Oh, God.
This place is creeping me out.

23:52.897 --> 23:55.965
- Let's go back downstairs, hmm?
- Hold on.

23:56.456 --> 23:57.878
Will you forget about the book?

23:57.913 --> 24:00.516
They have librarians for that.

24:02.118 --> 24:04.346
It'll just take a second.

24:18.860 --> 24:19.913
Oh, my God!

24:23.388 --> 24:26.147
Oh, my God.

24:26.861 --> 24:28.475
Adrian?

24:29.829 --> 24:32.542
Adrian? Adrian!

24:34.268 --> 24:36.120
Oh, my God!

24:36.155 --> 24:38.099
A little help.!

24:38.573 --> 24:40.992
Oh, my God! Adrian!
Don't let go.

24:41.027 --> 24:43.743
Don't let go.
That's good advice.

24:43.778 --> 24:46.459
I better write that down,
or I'm gonna forget it.

24:46.494 --> 24:48.291
Don't worry.
They'll be down in a minute.

24:48.326 --> 24:50.560
Okay, here's another question.

24:50.595 --> 24:53.241
A man is blocking the main
entrance of a store.

24:53.276 --> 24:55.776
- What is the charge?
- Obstructing a public access.

24:55.811 --> 24:57.242
That's right.

24:57.688 --> 25:00.216
The test used to determine
whether a handgun has recently...

25:00.251 --> 25:01.871
The paraffin diphenylamine test.

25:01.906 --> 25:04.196
Are all the questions gonna be this easy?

25:04.231 --> 25:05.443
I think so.

25:05.478 --> 25:07.314
This is the official practice book.

25:07.349 --> 25:10.376
Then I am in, baby.

25:10.411 --> 25:13.532
Already had my old uniform
cleaned and pressed.

25:13.567 --> 25:16.462
Adrian, don't you think that's a little
premature? - It's not premature.

25:16.497 --> 25:18.955
It is perfectly mature.

25:18.990 --> 25:22.763
Sharona, ahh, I'm back.

25:23.668 --> 25:26.062
Look who's awake.

25:26.097 --> 25:27.444
Are you ready for your test?

25:27.479 --> 25:28.862
Piece of cake.

25:28.897 --> 25:30.463
Mrs. Parlo, how are you feeling?

25:30.498 --> 25:32.201
Oh, don't worry about me.

25:32.236 --> 25:35.869
I heard what happened
to you in the library.

25:35.904 --> 25:37.331
It just means we're getting close.

25:37.366 --> 25:39.419
Somebody is getting nervous, Mrs. Parlo.

25:39.454 --> 25:44.751
So now I want to try to find out exactly
where they took you.

25:44.786 --> 25:46.151
Sharona, do you have that map?

25:46.186 --> 25:49.358
All right, but I...
I told the chief of police I...

25:49.393 --> 25:50.960
I couldn't help him.

25:50.995 --> 25:53.793
I had an afghan over my head.

25:53.828 --> 25:57.980
Maybe we'll be able to
figure it out anyway.

25:58.015 --> 25:59.497
Okay. - We're here.

26:01.487 --> 26:02.616
What are you doing?

26:02.651 --> 26:04.221
Just smoothing it out.

26:04.256 --> 26:06.530
What else do you remember about the trip?

26:06.565 --> 26:09.988
Well, like I said, I didn't see a thing.

26:10.023 --> 26:11.700
Did you hear anything?

26:11.735 --> 26:14.049
No. I'm sorry.

26:14.084 --> 26:15.779
Did you smell anything?

26:15.814 --> 26:18.780
You know, now that you mention it, I did.

26:18.815 --> 26:22.407
- I smelled fresh bread.
- Bread.

26:22.442 --> 26:23.667
Oh, my God. There's a...

26:23.702 --> 26:25.779
There's a big bakery on Claxton Boulevard.

26:25.814 --> 26:27.472
You can smell it when you drive past.

26:27.507 --> 26:31.349
And then we stopped for four or
maybe five minutes.

26:31.384 --> 26:33.507
- Why so long?
- Were they getting gas?

26:33.542 --> 26:35.280
- No.
- Could've been a drawbridge.

26:35.315 --> 26:36.402
Oh, my God.!

26:36.437 --> 26:39.106
Third Street drawbridge across channel.

26:39.141 --> 26:42.110
Then just a few minutes later,
we got to their house,

26:42.145 --> 26:44.998
and it was exactly 8:00.

26:45.033 --> 26:46.070
How do you know that?

26:46.105 --> 26:47.594
My watch was beeping.

26:47.629 --> 26:52.617
See, I... I set it so I don't forget to
take my ticker pills.

26:52.652 --> 26:54.065
And...

26:54.100 --> 26:55.949
And it was raining.

26:55.984 --> 26:58.462
Are you sure?
It wasn't raining all week.

26:58.497 --> 27:02.559
Listen, missy.
I think I know what rain feels like,

27:02.594 --> 27:07.492
and that's what I felt when they carried me
from the van into the house.

27:07.527 --> 27:09.215
And, you know, that wasn't all.

27:09.250 --> 27:11.346
- Cough drops.
- Cough drops?

27:11.381 --> 27:14.288
I distinctly smelled cough drops.

27:14.323 --> 27:16.126
Eucalyptus trees.

27:16.161 --> 27:18.497
They smell like cough drops.

27:18.784 --> 27:20.349
There's the big bakery.

27:20.384 --> 27:22.267
Turn here. You gotta turn...
Turn here.

27:22.302 --> 27:24.598
Will you relax?
I'm turning.

27:27.232 --> 27:28.847
Okay, there's the drawbridge.

27:28.882 --> 27:31.127
Stop the car!
The bridge is up!

27:31.162 --> 27:32.210
Do you wanna drive?

27:32.245 --> 27:34.495
No. You're doing fine.

27:36.161 --> 27:37.540
This has to be the block.

27:37.575 --> 27:40.573
I can smell the eucalyptus from here.

27:43.145 --> 27:45.635
But which house?

27:45.670 --> 27:49.108
- Well, we'll know in a few seconds.
- What do you mean?

27:49.143 --> 27:53.229
Mrs. Parlo said it was
raining at exactly 8:00.

27:53.264 --> 27:56.821
But what she felt wasn't rain.

27:58.559 --> 28:01.607
Automatic sprinkler system.

28:01.872 --> 28:04.027
That's our house.

28:09.491 --> 28:12.932
Oh, which one is it?

28:14.658 --> 28:16.374
Oh, great.

28:16.409 --> 28:17.700
That one.

28:20.476 --> 28:23.282
They fed her pizza, remember?

28:24.779 --> 28:27.233
You're gonna be a pretty good cop.

28:27.268 --> 28:29.748
- Now what?
- Now...

28:30.353 --> 28:32.931
Now we take a picture...

28:32.966 --> 28:36.220
of whoever comes out of the house.

28:37.401 --> 28:40.702
Mrs. Parlo said she recognized
their voices.

28:40.737 --> 28:44.595
Maybe she knows who they are.

28:44.630 --> 28:46.679
- How are we gonna get their picture?
- I don't know.

28:46.714 --> 28:48.376
Why don't you think of something?

28:48.411 --> 28:51.098
I did the sprinkler thing.
It's your turn.

28:51.133 --> 28:54.455
- Oh, so now we're taking turns?
- Yes, now we're taking turns.

28:54.490 --> 28:56.086
- Since when?
- It's our new policy.

28:56.121 --> 28:58.495
Didn't you get my memo?

28:59.401 --> 29:01.468
Stay here.

29:01.779 --> 29:03.864
- I'll send you a memo.
- What did you say?

29:03.899 --> 29:04.891
Nothing.

29:04.926 --> 29:07.295
I heard the word "memo."

29:07.330 --> 29:10.625
Just stay here and study for your test.

29:26.783 --> 29:29.071
Get the camera ready.

29:30.237 --> 29:33.316
- Harold, what's going on?
- Nothing.

29:33.351 --> 29:35.512
These cars have a mind of their own.

29:35.547 --> 29:38.438
German engineering, my ass.

29:38.473 --> 29:40.386
I don't see anything.

29:41.111 --> 29:42.511
Let's go.

29:52.833 --> 29:56.225
- Well, strike me pretty!
- You do recognize them.

29:56.260 --> 30:00.227
Oh, yes. They were here just last week.
Remember?

30:00.262 --> 30:03.072
They came about the cat.

30:03.107 --> 30:06.075
Two weeks ago,
Nana took in a stray cat.

30:06.110 --> 30:08.259
It didn't have a collar.
We didn't know who it belonged to.

30:08.294 --> 30:10.028
We were worried about you.

30:10.063 --> 30:11.864
I ran off some flyers and put them up,

30:11.899 --> 30:14.572
and the next day this couple called us.

30:14.607 --> 30:16.633
Harold and Carol Maloney.

30:16.668 --> 30:19.457
They own an antique store
on Grannis Boulevard.

30:19.492 --> 30:20.748
It's five blocks away.

30:20.783 --> 30:24.518
I knew there was something
sneaky about them.

30:24.553 --> 30:27.454
You know where I should have
stabbed them?

30:27.489 --> 30:29.634
Yeah, I... I think we do.

30:29.669 --> 30:33.000
Their cat had run away a few days ago,
so they came over,

30:33.035 --> 30:34.285
but it wasn't theirs.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.525
Is that it?
They just looked at the cat?

30:36.560 --> 30:38.648
Did they say or do anything unusual?

30:38.683 --> 30:40.950
No. They were just here a few minutes.

30:40.985 --> 30:42.126
We never saw 'em again.

30:42.161 --> 30:45.692
Mr. Monk, I don't understand.
They're antique dealers.

30:45.727 --> 30:47.354
What do they want with Nana?

30:47.389 --> 30:49.898
And what's all this crap
about turkey dinners?

30:49.933 --> 30:51.793
I don't know... yet.

30:51.828 --> 30:52.971
Why don't we call the captain?

30:53.006 --> 30:54.844
Let's wait until tomorrow.

30:54.879 --> 30:56.610
I should have more clout by then.

30:56.645 --> 30:57.780
What do you mean?

30:57.815 --> 31:02.480
Well, thanks to your granddaughter,
by this time tomorrow...

31:03.298 --> 31:05.511
I'll be back on the force.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.483
Have a seat.

31:15.278 --> 31:18.626
You'll have 30 minutes to answer
all 50 questions.

31:18.661 --> 31:20.833
Make sure you fill in the little
circles completely,

31:20.868 --> 31:23.329
so the computer can read them.

31:23.364 --> 31:25.515
What if I finish early?

31:25.550 --> 31:27.942
You might want to check your work.

31:27.977 --> 31:30.599
I don't think that'll be necessary.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.674
Are you ready?

31:33.800 --> 31:35.770
Go. Good luck.

31:45.331 --> 31:50.112
Yes? - Could you take
one of these off the table?

31:50.147 --> 31:51.793
Why?

31:52.001 --> 31:56.687
I can't have two.
I get confused.

31:58.188 --> 32:00.159
Which one?

32:01.538 --> 32:02.970
This one.

32:03.005 --> 32:05.492
Wait. Uh, you know what?

32:05.527 --> 32:07.296
That one.

32:08.389 --> 32:09.820
Wait.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.634
You... You better choose.

32:12.669 --> 32:15.726
All right. Okay?

32:17.579 --> 32:21.792
Thanks. I'll... I'll do the same
for you sometime.

33:07.573 --> 33:11.200
You, uh, have a half hour.

33:11.694 --> 33:13.415
No problem.

33:18.319 --> 33:20.721
No problem.

34:55.418 --> 34:57.292
Oh, you finished?

34:58.650 --> 35:00.595
I need a new sheet.

35:03.639 --> 35:05.861
A little hole.

35:23.498 --> 35:25.298
Now, where is he?

35:25.333 --> 35:28.135
- He locked himself in.
- In my office?

35:28.170 --> 35:29.536
I don't think so.

35:29.571 --> 35:31.944
Hey, Monk, open the door!

35:32.678 --> 35:34.235
Let me guess.

35:34.270 --> 35:36.066
He didn't pass the test.

35:36.101 --> 35:37.923
He didn't quite finish.

35:37.958 --> 35:38.939
How far did he get?

35:38.974 --> 35:40.113
He did one question.

35:40.148 --> 35:42.685
Over and over and over.

35:42.720 --> 35:44.989
- What's that?
- His pencil.

35:45.261 --> 35:47.491
Adrian, you can retake the test!

35:47.526 --> 35:49.379
I'll never pass.!

35:49.414 --> 35:51.069
Hey, Monk?

35:51.104 --> 35:53.139
Go find a key.

35:53.174 --> 35:55.103
Monk, listen to me.

35:55.138 --> 35:56.344
Listen.

35:56.379 --> 35:58.342
I think that you...

35:58.377 --> 36:01.036
you failed that test on purpose.

36:01.071 --> 36:05.709
You-You don't want to get your
badge back on a technicality, right?

36:05.744 --> 36:07.720
You want to earn it.

36:08.787 --> 36:11.484
You will. Adrian, you will.

36:11.519 --> 36:14.560
You'll... You're gonna be
a great cop again.

36:14.595 --> 36:18.587
You're gonna do it the right way,
and I respect you for that.

36:18.622 --> 36:20.916
Now, open the door.

36:23.358 --> 36:25.960
Monk! Open that damn door!

36:25.995 --> 36:27.670
I'm gonna give you until three.

36:27.705 --> 36:29.597
A. M. Or P. M.?

36:29.632 --> 36:32.959
Not three o'clock, you fool!

36:32.994 --> 36:34.345
One!

36:35.187 --> 36:36.582
Two!

36:38.016 --> 36:40.486
Hey, what the heck...
What is that? Monk!

36:40.521 --> 36:41.987
I think that's your chair.

36:42.022 --> 36:44.041
Monk, that's my father's chair!

36:44.076 --> 36:46.546
If you put one scratch
on that chair, I will...

36:46.581 --> 36:48.150
I will never forgive you!

36:48.185 --> 36:51.271
Monk, be careful with that chair.

36:52.970 --> 36:54.541
Move the chair, Monk.

36:54.576 --> 36:57.632
Monk, move the chair.

37:01.019 --> 37:02.666
Are you okay?

37:03.085 --> 37:08.054
You said "Be careful" because
you love that chair. - That's right.

37:08.089 --> 37:10.116
The kidnappers said "Be careful"

37:10.151 --> 37:13.509
when they carried
Mrs. Parlo out of the house.

37:13.544 --> 37:15.712
They weren't worried about her.

37:15.747 --> 37:18.098
They were worried about that chair.

37:18.133 --> 37:19.225
What chair?

37:19.260 --> 37:21.836
The chair she was tied to.

37:21.871 --> 37:24.654
That's what this whole
thing has been about.

37:25.943 --> 37:27.467
That's my grandmother's chair.!

37:27.502 --> 37:29.902
- I recognize it.!
- She is lying.

37:29.937 --> 37:32.778
People make false claims about
pieces like this, all the time.

37:32.813 --> 37:34.540
You like opera?

37:34.575 --> 37:35.865
Yes, we love it.

37:35.900 --> 37:37.434
Is that a crime?

37:37.469 --> 37:39.073
It should be.

37:39.944 --> 37:43.732
Ooh, captain, please!

37:46.746 --> 37:48.543
Tell me about the chair, Mr. Maloney.

37:48.578 --> 37:50.404
I'd be happy to.

37:50.439 --> 37:54.016
It is a Fanback Windsor in original finish,
built in 1774.

37:54.051 --> 37:56.563
Dealers like us wait our whole lives
for a piece like this.

37:56.598 --> 37:59.282
Note the engraving on the back
in the shape of Monticello. - Mm-hmm.

37:59.317 --> 38:03.120
This chair was personally handcrafted
by Thomas Jefferson.

38:03.155 --> 38:07.927
In fact, there is some evidence to support
the fact that he sat in this very chair

38:07.962 --> 38:10.608
while he drafted the Declaration
of Independence.

38:10.643 --> 38:12.438
Does it swivel?

38:14.595 --> 38:15.941
How much is it worth?

38:15.976 --> 38:18.297
Two. Maybe 2.5.

38:18.332 --> 38:19.965
Million?

38:20.187 --> 38:22.789
Yes, Lieutenant, million.

38:22.824 --> 38:26.592
Actually, we'll find out for sure
next week. We're auctioning it off.

38:26.627 --> 38:30.001
I don't imagine any of you will
be bidding on it.

38:30.036 --> 38:31.725
Well, where did you get it?

38:31.760 --> 38:32.929
I'll tell you where they got it.

38:32.964 --> 38:34.864
They stole it from
my grandmother's house.

38:34.899 --> 38:36.310
She's right.

38:36.345 --> 38:38.153
Your cat ran away.

38:38.188 --> 38:39.809
You saw the flyer,

38:39.844 --> 38:42.366
and you went to their house looking for it,

38:42.401 --> 38:44.633
and that's where you saw the chair.

38:44.668 --> 38:47.553
You must have recognized it right away,
but what could you do?

38:47.588 --> 38:49.347
You couldn't offer to buy it.

38:49.382 --> 38:51.928
They might have had it appraised,
and that would have ruined everything.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.135
You couldn't steal it.

38:53.170 --> 38:55.222
The cops would have been looking for it.

38:55.257 --> 38:56.593
You'd never be able to sell it.

38:56.628 --> 38:58.115
Then you had an idea.

38:58.150 --> 39:00.226
It was brilliant, really.

39:00.261 --> 39:04.600
You kidnapped Mrs. Parlo and carried
her out of the house with the chair,

39:04.635 --> 39:07.258
Made some ridiculous ransom
demand.../ Be careful.

39:07.293 --> 39:08.367
And then let her go.

39:08.402 --> 39:12.183
You figured anyone would be
so relieved to have their nana back

39:12.218 --> 39:15.745
that they wouldn't even remember
the missing chair.

39:15.780 --> 39:18.395
Prepare to be disappointed, Mr. Monk.

39:18.430 --> 39:22.217
I can prove providence.
I have a receipt.

39:22.252 --> 39:25.247
We bought the chair from a dealer
in Baton Rouge four years ago.

39:25.282 --> 39:27.169
The poor sap.
He didn't know what he was sitting on.

39:27.204 --> 39:28.876
Literally.

39:29.244 --> 39:31.453
I bet it's a forgery.

39:31.488 --> 39:33.124
Forgery is a serious offense.

39:33.159 --> 39:35.169
It is a class "C" felony.

39:35.204 --> 39:37.788
Or "B." "B" or "C."

39:37.823 --> 39:39.761
The receipt will have to speak for itself.

39:39.796 --> 39:41.984
Unfortunately, the dealer has
since passed on.

39:42.019 --> 39:44.187
Oh, how convenient.

39:44.222 --> 39:49.393
So can you prove that the chair
belongs to you? Hmm?

39:50.048 --> 39:51.893
No. Interesting. Huh.

39:51.928 --> 39:54.853
Okay, well, until you can,
I suggest you all leave.

39:54.888 --> 39:56.404
It's my dinnertime.

39:57.820 --> 39:59.366
Well, that could've gone better.

39:59.401 --> 40:01.381
Can't we do anything?

40:01.416 --> 40:04.597
I cannot question them officially
unless you've got something,

40:04.632 --> 40:06.965
anything, to prove that you own that chair.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.615
Do you have anything on paper?

40:08.650 --> 40:11.701
No. Nana bought it at
a flea market 20 years ago.

40:11.736 --> 40:13.171
She can't even remember where.

40:13.206 --> 40:14.502
Do you have a picture of it?

40:14.537 --> 40:16.866
I checked all our photo albums.
Nothing.

40:16.901 --> 40:19.502
Wait a minute. Listen.

40:19.537 --> 40:20.623
Listen to what?

40:20.658 --> 40:22.584
Listen to you.

40:22.772 --> 40:25.161
You're not sneezing.

40:25.196 --> 40:27.201
You haven't sneezed at all
since we got here.

40:27.236 --> 40:28.219
That's true.

40:28.254 --> 40:31.744
The Maloneys said they had
a cat that ran away.

40:31.779 --> 40:35.319
- That's why they went to Julie's house.
- Right.

40:35.354 --> 40:38.401
They lied.
They never had a cat.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.526
Otherwise you'd be sneezing your head off.

40:40.561 --> 40:42.425
You're right. He's right.

40:42.709 --> 40:44.411
I'm lost, as usual.

40:44.446 --> 40:46.820
If the Maloneys never had a cat,

40:46.855 --> 40:49.224
why did they go to your house
in the first place?

40:49.259 --> 40:53.938
They must have known
about the chair somehow.

40:53.973 --> 40:57.107
Do you still have a copy of that flyer?

40:57.142 --> 40:59.003
Uh, I think so.

41:06.594 --> 41:09.541
That's the prettiest
picture I've ever seen.

41:14.567 --> 41:17.041
Hi, folks. Remember us?

41:17.320 --> 41:20.470
I was wondering if
we could bother you again.

41:21.855 --> 41:23.229
Thank you.

41:26.278 --> 41:28.507
Congratulations.
You solved the case.

41:28.542 --> 41:30.794
Well, I had a little help.

41:34.791 --> 41:37.567
Hi, Nana. Guess what!

41:37.602 --> 41:39.651
I'm quitting law school.

41:39.686 --> 41:41.885
I'm buying my own bakery.

41:42.217 --> 41:43.912
Yes, we can afford it.

41:43.947 --> 41:46.428
We can afford anything we want.

41:46.789 --> 41:48.694
I love you, Nana.
