PLEASE DON'T EVER MAKE ME
GO ON CAMERA AGAIN.

38:12.861 --> 38:14.022
YOU LOOK GOOD ON CAMERA.

38:14.022 --> 38:16.294
WHO KNOWS?
MAYBE WE CAN GET THE FBI

38:16.294 --> 38:18.467
TO GIVE YOU BONUSES
FOR TV APPEARANCES.

38:18.467 --> 38:19.798
[ CHUCKLES ]

38:19.798 --> 38:21.730
GIVE ME A MINUTE.
I WILL TAKE YOU HOME.

38:27.736 --> 38:30.609
SHE'S REALLY INTO YOU.

38:30.609 --> 38:31.810
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

38:31.810 --> 38:33.382
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

38:33.382 --> 38:34.343
OH, COME ON.

38:34.343 --> 38:35.614
I'VE KNOWN HER FOR YEARS.

38:35.614 --> 38:37.716
SHE USED TO BE THAT WAY
WITH ME.

38:37.716 --> 38:38.987
WHA--

38:38.987 --> 38:41.420
UH, NOT THAT IT'S
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS,

38:41.420 --> 38:43.722
BUT...KATE AND I ARE JUST --
ARE JUST COLLEAGUES.

38:43.722 --> 38:45.023
WE'RE FRIENDS.
THAT'S IT.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.495
SO YOU'RE NOT INTO HER?

38:46.495 --> 38:47.756
NO. NO.

38:47.756 --> 38:49.958
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE NOT HER FATHER.

38:49.958 --> 38:51.600
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
HER HUSBAND ANYMORE,

38:51.600 --> 38:53.061
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST
STAY OUT OF HER PERSONAL LIFE.

38:53.061 --> 38:55.604
LOOK, I'M NOT TRYING TO GET
ALL UP IN HER BUSINESS.

38:55.604 --> 38:57.806
I-I-I BLEW IT WITH HER
A LONG TIME AGO.

38:57.806 --> 39:00.038
SHE DESERVES BETTER THAN ME,

39:00.038 --> 39:02.110
BUT SHE ALSO DESERVES BETTER

39:02.110 --> 39:03.912
THAN STAYING HUNG UP ON SOMEBODY
WHO'S NOT --

39:03.912 --> 39:05.013
SANE?

39:05.013 --> 39:07.376
I WAS GONNA SAY
"INTERESTED."

39:07.376 --> 39:11.349
THE TRUTH IS, NEITHER ONE OF US
ARE PROBABLY ANY GOOD FOR HER.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.853
SO, WE SHOULD JUST LET HER
MOVE ON WITH HER LIFE.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.925
I'M SURE AS HELL
NOT STANDING IN HER WAY.

39:16.925 --> 39:18.727
REALLY?

39:18.727 --> 39:20.028
BECAUSE TO MY EYES,

39:20.028 --> 39:21.790
IT -- IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE LEADING HER ON.

39:21.790 --> 39:24.933
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT
YOU'RE DOING IT ON PURPOSE.

39:24.933 --> 39:27.866
I'M JUST SAYING THAT
IF YOU CARE ABOUT HER --

39:27.866 --> 39:29.598
AND I THINK YOU DO --

39:29.598 --> 39:31.940
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LET HER KNOW
YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED.

39:36.875 --> 39:40.609
Max: WHAT IF I TOLD ALL OF YOU
THAT YOU'RE PARTIALLY BLIND?

39:40.609 --> 39:43.552
THAT RIGHT NOW, YOU THINK YOU'RE
SEEING THE WORLD AS IT TRULY IS,

39:43.552 --> 39:46.054
BUT IN ACTUALITY,
YOU'RE MISSING SOMETHING.

39:46.054 --> 39:47.416
IT'S TRUE.

39:47.416 --> 39:49.488
SEE, EVERY TIME WE OPEN
OUR EYES,

39:49.488 --> 39:51.620
LIGHT SHINES ONTO OUR RETINA.

39:51.620 --> 39:53.692
NERVE CELLS
CALLED PHOTORECEPTORS

39:53.692 --> 39:56.965
INTERPRET THE LIGHT, TRANSMIT
THE INFORMATION TO OUR BRAIN,

39:56.965 --> 39:58.427
AND THAT'S HOW WE SEE.

39:58.427 --> 40:00.569
BUT THERE'S A SMALL AREA
ON OUR RETINA

40:00.569 --> 40:02.571
WHERE THERE ARE
NO PHOTORECEPTORS.

40:02.571 --> 40:05.704
THIS IS CALLED A SCOTOMA,
OR "BLIND SPOT."

40:05.704 --> 40:07.175
WE ALL HAVE ONE.

40:07.175 --> 40:09.978
SO IF THAT'S TRUE,
HOW IS IT THAT WE NEVER NOTICE

40:09.978 --> 40:12.410
A BLACK AREA
IN OUR FIELD OF VISION?

40:12.410 --> 40:15.584
THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION.

40:15.584 --> 40:18.587
OUR ILLUSTRIOUS PROFESSOR
HAS RETURNED.

40:18.587 --> 40:20.589
WELCOME BACK.
NO, NO.

40:20.589 --> 40:23.722
YOU SEEM TO HAVE THINGS
WELL IN HAND, MR. LEWICKI.

40:23.722 --> 40:24.553
CARRY ON.

40:26.455 --> 40:28.426
JUST DON'T SCREW IT UP.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.459
[ LAUGHTER ]

40:32.100 --> 40:35.133
THE REASON YOU NEVER NOTICE
YOUR BLIND SPOT

40:35.133 --> 40:36.965
IS BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN
IS GREAT

40:36.965 --> 40:38.907
AT GUESSING
WHAT SHOULD BE THERE...

40:40.609 --> 40:43.472
...AND AUTOMATICALLY FILLING IN
THE BLANK.

40:46.144 --> 40:50.619
SOMETIMES WE KNOW
WHAT WE WANT TO SEE,

40:50.619 --> 40:53.752
AND OUR NEOCORTEX
TURNS THAT EXPECTATION

40:53.752 --> 40:55.584
INTO A KIND OF
VIRTUAL REALITY...

41:00.228 --> 41:03.762
...WHICH MEANS THAT
SOME OF THE WORLD WE SEE

41:03.762 --> 41:05.233
IS REALLY JUST AN ILLUSION --

41:05.233 --> 41:07.696
A SCARY THOUGHT

41:07.696 --> 41:11.169
WHEN YOU CONSIDER
HOW VULNERABLE THAT MAKES US.

41:11.169 --> 41:14.472
SO HOW DO WE UNCOVER
OUR BLIND SPOTS?

41:19.177 --> 41:21.009
HOW DO WE EVER FULLY SEE

41:21.009 --> 41:24.182
THE TRUTH THAT'S
RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES?

41:24.182 --> 41:27.986
WELL, A GOOD PLACE TO START
IS TO SIMPLY OPEN YOUR MIND,

41:27.986 --> 41:31.520
BECAUSE AS THE FRENCH
PHILOSOPHER HENRI BERGSON SAID,

41:31.520 --> 41:33.522
"THE EYE SEES ONLY WHAT THE MIND
IS PREPARED TO COMPREHEND."
