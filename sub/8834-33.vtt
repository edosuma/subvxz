an icebox like I asked?

01:24.792 --> 01:26.625
Ehh!

01:26.709 --> 01:29.834
I mean, here I am, on time and everything.

Engine number two's out.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.417
Ehh!

01:46.166 --> 01:48.291
A guy could die of thirst up here.

[radio] <i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

02:04.125 --> 02:06.417
[Baloo] Huh? Hang on.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.125
Old Baloo will help you.

02:34.709 --> 02:37.375
Hey! Do you know who you are?

02:37.458 --> 02:38.667
You're Khan!

02:41.959 --> 02:45.041
You saved my life, Mr. Bubbaloo.

02:45.125 --> 02:46.375
That's Baloo.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.375
Yes. I owe you everything.

02:49.458 --> 02:51.625
At this moment, Khan industries

02:51.709 --> 02:55.583
is worth 3.7 billion dollars.

02:55.667 --> 02:59.667
Hmm. My watch must be running
a few thousand slow.

02:59.792 --> 03:02.959
You may have whatever you want.
Simply name it.

03:03.041 --> 03:05.542
Aw, you don't owe me a thing.

03:05.625 --> 03:08.208
Perhaps, but my motto is,

03:08.291 --> 03:12.500
always repay your debts
and never break a deal.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.625
Well, don't want much.

03:14.709 --> 03:16.500
Maybe a refrigerator and...

03:16.583 --> 03:17.875
[Khan] And...

03:17.959 --> 03:19.667
[Baloo] I don't know.

03:19.750 --> 03:22.917
Some sodas, oh, and a bottle opener
would be nice.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.583
I can't really say.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.542
Take all the time you need.

03:26.625 --> 03:29.166
Drop by my office when you've decided.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.375
Only one stipulation.

03:31.458 --> 03:35.125
You must keep our arrangement a secret.

03:35.208 --> 03:39.291
I may be indebted,
but I don't want it known to everyone.

03:44.291 --> 03:47.166
[Becky] There you are, Baloo. About time.

03:47.250 --> 03:51.375
Hey, Becker, boy, if I could tell you
what just happened to me.

03:51.458 --> 03:54.542
No stories.
Just explain where that came from.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.291
[Baloo] My icebox!

03:56.375 --> 03:57.542
[Becky] Yours?

03:59.375 --> 04:01.291
I-- I bought it.

04:01.375 --> 04:02.583
With what?

04:02.667 --> 04:04.500
Well, uh...

04:04.583 --> 04:06.625
[Molly] Did you find some money, Baloo?

04:06.709 --> 04:09.041
I found a quarter in the gutter once.

04:09.125 --> 04:13.250
Yeah! That's it. I found it
in the, uh, the gutter.

04:13.333 --> 04:16.916
Which is probably where you were all day
instead of delivering cargo.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.250
Hey, I was on time... Before I got late.

04:21.333 --> 04:25.792
You may not care about this business,
but Higher for Hire means something to me.

04:25.875 --> 04:28.250
Yeah, yeah. It means work, work, work.

04:28.333 --> 04:31.709
No! It means a home and a life

04:31.792 --> 04:34.417
and, and everything
that's important to me.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.709
Like M-O-N-Y, money.

04:36.792 --> 04:40.000
All the dough in the world
wouldn't be enough for you.

04:40.083 --> 04:45.792
But not me. If I had the bucks,
I'd quit working, lay back and relax.

04:45.875 --> 04:47.083
Oh, baby.

04:47.166 --> 04:49.166
Well, keep dreaming.

04:49.250 --> 04:52.500
You don't even have enough
to buy your plane back from me.

04:52.709 --> 04:57.083
Hey, you're right, Becky. But I will.

04:57.792 --> 04:59.583
[Becky] Where do you think
you're going, mister?

04:59.667 --> 05:02.125
Baloo. I'm yelling at you, Baloo.

05:02.208 --> 05:04.834
Is mommy mad at Baloo?

05:04.917 --> 05:09.750
No. She really likes him,
and he really likes her.

05:09.834 --> 05:13.542
Sometimes they like each other better
than others.

05:13.959 --> 05:15.500
[Baloo] Ahem! Hello?

05:15.583 --> 05:17.875
I thought you'd be here 10 minutes ago.

05:17.959 --> 05:19.041
Sit.

05:19.125 --> 05:22.375
I would have been here earlier
but I had trouble with my tie.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.208
How dreadfully uninteresting.

05:24.291 --> 05:29.625
So, have you decided what you want
to even the score?

05:29.709 --> 05:33.709
I was kind of thinking about
buying back the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

05:33.792 --> 05:35.375
If it isn't too much trouble.

05:35.458 --> 05:36.542
Granted.

05:38.417 --> 05:41.417
Really? That's all there is to it?

05:41.500 --> 05:44.500
As I said, I always repay my debts.

05:44.583 --> 05:47.041
Now, if there's nothing further...

05:47.125 --> 05:49.375
Well, I don't know.

05:49.458 --> 05:53.875
I could sure use some gas
and maybe one of them air fresheners.

05:53.959 --> 05:57.583
Yes, yes. Is the score settled?

05:57.667 --> 06:00.500
Well, you said I could take all
the time I needed.

06:00.583 --> 06:04.125
[sighs] So I did.

06:04.208 --> 06:06.667
Well then, I'll be back tomorrow.

06:08.333 --> 06:13.083
I never figured Khan so dumb
as to promise someone anything he wants.

06:13.166 --> 06:17.291
[Baloo] <i>Sometimes I think that guy</i>
<i>isn't playing with a full deck of marbles.</i>

06:21.125 --> 06:23.458
Hiya, Little Britches. Becky.

06:25.208 --> 06:26.375
[Becky] What's this?

06:26.458 --> 06:30.000
Oh, about $50,000 for the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

06:30.083 --> 06:32.250
Keep the change.

06:32.333 --> 06:36.083
Where did you get
all the moola, Papa Bear?

06:36.166 --> 06:40.500
It was left to me
by my favorite uncle. Uh...

06:40.583 --> 06:42.959
Hoover! Happy Hoover.

06:43.041 --> 06:46.083
I didn't know you had any rich relatives.

06:46.166 --> 06:48.125
The two of us were very close.

06:48.208 --> 06:51.542
Uncle Huey Hartley
meant everything to me.

06:51.625 --> 06:53.625
Maybe a million everythings.

06:53.709 --> 06:56.333
But I thought you said
his name was Happy Hoover.

06:56.458 --> 07:00.125
It was. Huey Hartley was his nickname.

07:00.208 --> 07:03.500
Happy "Huey Hartley" Hoover.

07:03.583 --> 07:05.792
But enough with the past.

07:05.875 --> 07:10.333
Now that I'm an heiress,
I'll take the <i>Duck </i> and fly.

07:10.458 --> 07:13.542
You're gonna quit Higher for Hire?

07:13.625 --> 07:16.208
I'm gonna do all the things
I've only dreamed of.

07:16.291 --> 07:20.417
Like nothing.
And I plan to work at it every day.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.667
What do you say, kid?

07:23.667 --> 07:25.417
But what about Miss Cunningham?

07:25.500 --> 07:28.625
I'll do fine. Don't worry about me.

07:28.709 --> 07:31.792
With this money,
I'll get a new plane and a pilot.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.917
Only the best for Higher for Hire.

07:34.000 --> 07:34.917
See?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.750
But you guys are friends.

07:36.834 --> 07:39.250
We'll still be friends.

07:39.333 --> 07:42.667
It's not like I'm moving
to the other side of the world.

07:42.750 --> 07:45.125
Just the other side of the tracks.

07:48.417 --> 07:51.458
Just the typhoon I'm looking for.

07:52.709 --> 07:58.542
I think I'll start with a set of trains,
a rolly-coaster, a platypus,

07:58.625 --> 08:02.291
a purple kite, seven snakes,
a pinball machine,

08:02.375 --> 08:04.041
a carton of chewing gum...

08:04.125 --> 08:05.709
Granted.

08:05.792 --> 08:07.959
Is that it?

08:08.041 --> 08:09.125
It?

08:09.208 --> 08:11.875
I haven't even warmed up yet.

08:13.291 --> 08:16.250
A monogrammed hammock,
two pairs of snow shoes,

08:16.333 --> 08:20.375
a blue kazoo, bag of goopers,
1,000 ping-pong balls...

08:20.458 --> 08:25.250
...a peck of pickled peppers,
12 dozen snorkels, an electric bow tie,

08:25.333 --> 08:27.291
two baseball bats, one for each team,

08:27.375 --> 08:32.082
100 pairs of wax lips--
No, make that 200 pairs of wax lips...

08:32.166 --> 08:35.125
Boy. My mouth is dry.

08:35.207 --> 08:37.250
Asking for stuff is hard work.

08:37.332 --> 08:41.082
I'll break and be back tomorrow with more.

08:48.291 --> 08:50.208
Send in Garth.

08:50.291 --> 08:51.625
I have a job.

08:51.709 --> 08:55.917
I do deplore pests.

08:58.750 --> 09:02.250
Molly, pretty soon we're gonna have
a brand-new pilot.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.417
We'll do even better than before.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.917
Aren't you excited?

09:06.000 --> 09:09.959
Uh-huh.
Why's the new pilot called "the Barber"?

09:10.041 --> 09:14.000
I don't know honey,
but I'm told he's very good.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.583
Duck!

09:28.291 --> 09:31.625
What's the matter with you?
What kind of pilot flies like that?

09:31.709 --> 09:34.083
Crop duster, ma'am.

09:34.166 --> 09:36.333
But had to give it up--

09:36.417 --> 09:38.208
Nerves. See?

09:38.291 --> 09:42.542
In the future,
I'll expect you to fly higher.

09:42.625 --> 09:46.500
Can't. Have this pesky fear of heights.

09:49.750 --> 09:52.625
I suppose
I could wear a blindfold.

09:52.709 --> 09:54.417
Blindfold?

09:54.500 --> 09:58.792
Right. Have a pesky fear of the dark, too.

09:58.875 --> 10:01.792
Is there anything else you're afraid of?

10:01.875 --> 10:04.792
Well, not really...

10:04.875 --> 10:08.750
But you don't have
any platypuses around here, do you?

10:09.917 --> 10:11.834
I just hate platypuses.

10:11.917 --> 10:15.125
Mommy, I miss Baloo.

10:15.208 --> 10:17.333
Oh, me, too, Molly. Me, too.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.000
<i>[music plays]</i>

10:42.000 --> 10:44.041

Hey, spin it again, old buddy of mine.

10:50.667 --> 10:53.333
That song makes my feet happy.

10:58.375 --> 11:00.625
Another soda, my good man?

11:00.709 --> 11:03.291
I do believe I'd like that.

11:03.375 --> 11:05.625
Hey, isn't it grand being rich?

11:05.709 --> 11:09.125
They're right. Money does buy happiness.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.166
[cuckoo chimes]

11:12.250 --> 11:14.834
Look. It's time for another birthday.

11:14.917 --> 11:18.250
But you've already had
four birthday parties today.

11:18.333 --> 11:23.041
Yeah. If I keep this up,
I'll be old before my time.

11:24.542 --> 11:27.875
Boy, I love having all this stuff.

11:27.959 --> 11:30.667
Kit? Kit, where did you go?

11:30.750 --> 11:32.792
Hey, good idea.

11:32.875 --> 11:35.333
Maybe we can play
a little hide and go peek.

11:35.417 --> 11:38.000
You know what I'd really like to do?

11:38.083 --> 11:39.667
Visit Miss Cunningham.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.250
It's been over a week.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.333
Who?

11:42.417 --> 11:44.917
Rebecca, your ex-boss.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.667
Oh, right. Yeah.
I kinda miss ol' what's-her-name, too.

11:48.750 --> 11:52.000
What do you say, we wander over
and invite her to our party.

11:52.083 --> 11:53.667
After you.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.333
No, no. After you.

Yeah, we snatch the lug tonight.

back later today...

Or tomorrow.

12:34.625 --> 12:36.166
Or next month!

12:37.583 --> 12:39.709
Mommy, what's the matter?

12:39.792 --> 12:43.542
That's the third client
we've lost this week.

12:43.625 --> 12:46.458
It can't get any worse than this.

13:00.333 --> 13:02.083
[The Barber] I quit.

13:02.166 --> 13:05.166
What? You can't quit.
How about my shipments?

13:05.250 --> 13:10.083
Sorry lady, but you never told me
I'd be carrying strawberries.

13:10.166 --> 13:11.583
But that's just cargo.

13:11.667 --> 13:12.750
Oh...

13:12.834 --> 13:15.417
Strawberries give me the willies.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.333
No.

13:16.834 --> 13:19.542
Joe's got to
draw the line somewhere.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.208
Ooh...

13:21.500 --> 13:22.542
Strawberries.

13:29.208 --> 13:33.291
That's it. Where am I gonna get a pilot
on a moment's notice?

13:33.375 --> 13:34.333
[horn honking]

13:39.625 --> 13:40.792
Baloo!

13:42.792 --> 13:44.375
Hi there, sweetcakes.

13:44.458 --> 13:46.125
How you doing, Beckers?

13:46.208 --> 13:48.208
I'm doing fine, Baloo,

13:48.291 --> 13:51.458
though I'm kinda looking for a pilot.

13:51.542 --> 13:54.375
Well, good luck.
There's lots of them out there.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.250
Miss Cunningham.

13:56.333 --> 13:58.709
What happened to Higher for Hire?

13:58.792 --> 14:01.667
If you're in trouble,
I'm sure Baloo will help.

14:01.750 --> 14:05.500
Don't be silly.
Things couldn't be... better.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.250
Hey, outstanding.

14:07.333 --> 14:10.375
So, you want to come to my next
birthday party?

14:10.458 --> 14:12.458
It starts in 15 minutes.

14:12.542 --> 14:16.250
Thanks, Baloo, but I'm not much
in the partying mood.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.375
Some people have no sense of priorities.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.041
Let's go, Kit.

14:20.125 --> 14:21.667
But, Baloo--

14:35.083 --> 14:38.417
Baloo, you've got to do something
to help Miss Cunningham.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.625
She said everything was hunky-dory.

14:40.709 --> 14:42.709
But you saw the place.

14:42.792 --> 14:45.208
So, everyone has their off days.

14:45.291 --> 14:48.417
Look at me. One day I had nothing.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.166
Things worked out.

14:50.250 --> 14:52.333
She needs your help.

14:52.417 --> 14:54.959
It's not like I owe her anything.

14:55.041 --> 14:56.000
I paid her.

14:56.083 --> 14:58.458
She'd do the same for you, Baloo.

14:58.542 --> 15:01.500
I gave her 50,000.
Even invited her to my party.

15:01.583 --> 15:04.709
What's the big deal?
Just because I'm the galoot with the loot.

15:04.792 --> 15:05.875
Ow!

15:05.959 --> 15:07.458
Must be defective.

15:09.542 --> 15:13.291
Hey! If that's another birthday cake,
just dump it over there.

15:13.792 --> 15:14.875
Hey!

15:18.291 --> 15:20.959
I'm never gonna stay
in business like this.

15:21.041 --> 15:22.500
[Kit] Baloo's been kidnapped!

15:22.583 --> 15:24.250
Baloo's been kidnapped!

15:24.333 --> 15:25.583
What?

15:25.667 --> 15:28.583
They have Baloo and want $200,000!

15:28.667 --> 15:33.625
"Put the money in the trash can
under Clapton Bridge at midnight.

15:33.709 --> 15:36.959
If you contact the police,
you'll never see your friend again."

15:37.041 --> 15:39.500
You've got to do something,
Miss Cunningham.

15:39.583 --> 15:42.583
What can I do, Kit? I'm nearly broke.

15:42.667 --> 15:46.000
Mommy, I got some pennies. Will that help?

15:46.083 --> 15:49.417
Maybe if we sold everything he owns.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.333
Yeah.

15:56.917 --> 16:01.166
[muffled shouting]

16:01.250 --> 16:03.917
You ain't going nowheres, brother.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.208
Ouch!

16:05.709 --> 16:08.792
Yeah. We did like you asked, sir.

16:08.875 --> 16:10.917
Nah. He's not hurt...

16:11.000 --> 16:12.500
Yet.

16:12.583 --> 16:14.500
Will you shut up?

16:14.583 --> 16:16.667
Oh, no. Not you, sir.

16:16.750 --> 16:20.375
Yes. I do like my knees very much, sir.

16:20.458 --> 16:22.625
Aah!

16:23.834 --> 16:25.834
And have a nice evening.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.333
Whew.

16:34.417 --> 16:35.500
There.

16:35.583 --> 16:37.041
That should take care of him.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.709
Yow!

16:42.792 --> 16:44.166
Go get him!

16:53.166 --> 16:55.166
How did we do, Miss Cunningham?

16:55.250 --> 16:56.458
Good news?

16:56.542 --> 16:59.125
I'm afraid we're still short by a lot.

16:59.208 --> 17:01.291
But we sold everything,

17:01.375 --> 17:03.000
even the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

17:03.583 --> 17:04.583
Well...

17:05.290 --> 17:08.165
There's still one thing
that hasn't been sold.

17:08.250 --> 17:09.500
But I'm only a kid.

17:09.583 --> 17:10.959
No, Kit.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.083
But what else is left to sell?

17:13.165 --> 17:14.709
Higher for Hire.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.375
I'm sorry, Miss Cunningham.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.959
It's just a dumb old business anyway.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.791
The important thing now
is we get Baloo back.

17:42.792 --> 17:44.250
[clunking]

17:44.333 --> 17:47.333
Shh! You want to scare away
the kidnappers?

17:47.417 --> 17:51.917
Sorry, but all Molly's pennies are heavy.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.500
We're just lucky she had enough
to put us over the top.

17:57.917 --> 17:58.917
Look!

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
It must be the kidnapper.

18:01.083 --> 18:04.291
Judging by his attire,
he's not a very good one.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.834
[Kit] Excuse me, mister.

18:07.917 --> 18:10.125
But I think I have
what you're looking for.

18:10.208 --> 18:13.041
Fish sticks? Mmm.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.417
Well, no.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.458
$200,000.

18:16.583 --> 18:19.583
Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.917
This will buy a lot of fish sticks.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.542
Wait! Where's Baloo?

18:23.625 --> 18:28.041
We have Baloo.
Did you bring the money?

18:29.166 --> 18:30.959
Uh, excuse me.

18:31.041 --> 18:32.083
[Kit] Give me that!

18:32.166 --> 18:34.333
[old homeless guy] Ow! Ooh! Let go!

18:34.417 --> 18:35.625
My fish sticks!

18:37.041 --> 18:39.417
It's all here. Now where's Baloo?

18:42.458 --> 18:44.959
[Baloo] You're not taking me alive!

18:45.041 --> 18:47.750
Yaah!

18:50.041 --> 18:51.542
[Baloo] Help!

18:51.625 --> 18:52.875
[Becky and Kit] Baloo!

18:59.041 --> 19:01.333
[Becky and Kit] Aah!

19:03.583 --> 19:04.542
Miss Cunningham!

19:05.125 --> 19:05.959
Aah!

19:08.083 --> 19:10.041
[Becky and Kit] Yaah!

19:15.834 --> 19:18.125
[Becky] We've got to head him off!

19:18.208 --> 19:20.792
[Kit] Come on! Faster! Faster!

19:21.709 --> 19:23.417
Oh, no! Look!

19:24.625 --> 19:26.625
Wait. I've got an idea.

19:26.709 --> 19:27.625
Ha ha!

19:29.208 --> 19:30.959
I'll be free in a minute.

19:42.417 --> 19:43.333
[Baloo] Whoa!

19:43.417 --> 19:45.250
Baloo, are you OK?

19:45.333 --> 19:47.375
Just dandy, Little Britches.

19:47.458 --> 19:50.792
Oh, we're glad you're safe.

19:50.875 --> 19:52.834
Thanks a million, Becky.

19:52.917 --> 19:54.917
You really saved my anchovies.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.750
You don't know the half of it.

19:56.834 --> 20:00.333
Miss Cunningham sold the <i>Sea Duck</i>
to raise the ransom money.

20:00.417 --> 20:02.875
You sold the <i>Sea Duck?</i>

20:02.959 --> 20:05.417
And Higher for Hire.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.583
What?

20:06.667 --> 20:11.667
I was getting tired
of the silly old business anyway.

20:11.750 --> 20:14.959
Now look, all this running around
in wet night air.

20:15.041 --> 20:16.291
I've caught a cold.

20:16.375 --> 20:18.667
Now wait one second.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.250
There's someone I have to see.

20:23.083 --> 20:26.959
I was expecting you 15 minutes ago.

20:27.041 --> 20:29.166
I've got to ask you another favor.

20:29.250 --> 20:32.250
And this is the last one, correct?

20:32.333 --> 20:35.333
I just want everything the way it was.

20:35.417 --> 20:36.625
Here you are.

20:36.709 --> 20:37.625
What's this?

20:37.709 --> 20:40.458
Everything back to the way it was.

20:40.542 --> 20:44.125
Yeah. I guess I should be on my way.

20:44.208 --> 20:47.333
Yes. A wise decision.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.250
[Garth] He didn't suspect a thing.

20:52.333 --> 20:54.458
He thought we were real kidnappers.

20:54.542 --> 20:57.500
Yeah. We taught him a lesson
he'll never forget.

20:57.583 --> 21:00.000
But why didn't we just bump him off?

21:00.083 --> 21:02.792
I always repay my debts.

21:02.875 --> 21:06.625
And I never go back on a deal.

21:06.709 --> 21:12.625
And this one is concluded
10 minutes ahead of schedule.

21:12.709 --> 21:17.000
Now. Shall we move on
to more important matters?

21:24.250 --> 21:26.750
I'm really sorry, Miss Cunningham.

21:26.834 --> 21:28.750
But at least we got Baloo back.

21:28.834 --> 21:30.834
[Baloo] Hold on! Hold on!

21:32.250 --> 21:33.250
Whoof!

21:35.250 --> 21:36.583
You OK, Papa Bear?

21:36.667 --> 21:40.125
Yeah. Couldn't be better.

21:40.208 --> 21:41.625
This is for you, Becky.

21:43.917 --> 21:46.291
I-- I don't understand.

21:46.375 --> 21:48.667
It's the deed to Higher for Hire.

21:48.750 --> 21:49.834
Yeah. That's right.

21:49.917 --> 21:52.917
It's all yours. Along with the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

21:53.000 --> 21:54.458
Where did you get it?

21:54.542 --> 21:57.291
I can't say. But it's perfectly legal.

21:57.375 --> 21:59.041
[Baloo] You know me.

21:59.125 --> 22:01.208
Well, it's still perfectly legal.

22:01.291 --> 22:03.041
But why?

22:03.125 --> 22:07.083
Because I owe you everything.

22:07.166 --> 22:11.792
Aw, you'd do the same for me. Right?

22:11.875 --> 22:13.667
I would now.

22:13.750 --> 22:15.875
I would now.
