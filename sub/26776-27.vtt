Just turn it on!

20:24.590 --> 20:26.291
SCHWOZ: Okay!

20:30.762 --> 20:33.065
- Ughhh!
- Ewww.

20:34.833 --> 20:37.102
- Somebody get me a mirror.

20:37.169 --> 20:41.406
I want to see myself for
the first time in fifteen years!

20:41.473 --> 20:45.644
- That's...
not a good idea.

20:45.711 --> 20:48.714
- AHHHHHH!

20:48.780 --> 20:51.049
What happened to me?!

20:51.116 --> 20:54.620
{\an5}- Well. It looks like you maybe
haven't brushed your teeth
in fifteen years.

20:54.686 --> 20:57.255
- Or your hair.
- Or exercised.

20:57.322 --> 21:00.225
- Or changed your clothes.

21:00.292 --> 21:02.894
- Well why would I?
I've been invisible.

21:02.961 --> 21:04.863
- Well there you go.
- There's your answer.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.798
- You look terrible.
PIPER: You're gross.

21:06.865 --> 21:08.533
- I'm hideous!

21:08.600 --> 21:12.871
If anybody needs me I'll be
crying in Schwoz's shower.

21:12.938 --> 21:17.542
- Uh no that's a private area--
- Ehhhh...

21:17.609 --> 21:20.045
- Emergency call.

21:24.650 --> 21:27.919
{\an8}- Captain Man emergency line,
how may I kick your conundrum?

21:30.188 --> 21:33.792
{\an8}What's that?
Giant cats, you say?

21:36.094 --> 21:40.465
{\an8}Fourteen of them, say you?

21:40.532 --> 21:43.535
{\an8}We're on it.

21:43.602 --> 21:45.971
{\an8}[ Jasper coughs ]

21:50.409 --> 21:51.710
{\an8}- Ooh hoo! Guys, look, I did it!

21:51.777 --> 21:54.880
{\an8}I hacked up
the straitjacket key!

21:54.946 --> 21:57.983
{\an8}Oh wait, that's my house key.
Weird.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.385
I swallowed that
when I was eight.
