00:19.136 --> 00:22.305
BOB: <i>That's weird. Someone took
</i> the mop part off this mop.

00:22.306 --> 00:23.906
Oh, my God. No!

00:23.907 --> 00:25.474
Sorry, Dad, I took it.

00:25.509 --> 00:26.742
I'm going out for cheerleader,
and I needed

00:26.743 --> 00:28.578
some practice pom-poms.
Oh, Gene,

00:28.579 --> 00:30.580
for my other pom-pom, I
borrowed your Rasta wig.

00:30.581 --> 00:32.815
Not cool, mon.
It's okay.

00:32.850 --> 00:35.251
So, Tina, you're going out
for cheerleader!

00:35.252 --> 00:36.328
That's exciting.

00:36.353 --> 00:37.820
Yeah. At wrestling matches,

00:37.821 --> 00:39.555
cheerleaders are only ten feet
from the action.

00:39.556 --> 00:41.624
When things get sweaty,
that's the splash zone.

00:41.658 --> 00:43.593
I-I don't know. Isn't
cheerleading kind of, well, silly?

00:43.594 --> 00:45.761
Plus, do you really want
to get splashed by that?

00:45.762 --> 00:46.762
Yes.

00:46.763 --> 00:47.997
Oh.
Don't you?

00:48.031 --> 00:49.599
What are you talking about?

00:49.600 --> 00:51.367
Cheerleaders help the team
win by jumping around

00:51.368 --> 00:53.236
and touching their toes
and asking if you're ready

00:53.237 --> 00:54.871
and then they say, "Okay!"

00:54.905 --> 00:57.707
And they whip the crowd into
a frenzy by spelling words.

00:57.741 --> 00:59.509
W-O-R-D-S! Words!

00:59.543 --> 01:01.811
Lin, you're talking
like you were a cheerleader.

01:01.845 --> 01:04.513
What? I was!
Well, my best friend Monica was.

01:04.515 --> 01:06.349
So I was right there in the entourage.

01:06.350 --> 01:08.551
People were like, "Hey, let's go
to cheerleader practice."

01:08.552 --> 01:10.612
And I would be like,
"Okay, I'll drive you."

01:10.621 --> 01:12.455
Tryouts are today.
I didn't want to tell you guys

01:12.456 --> 01:15.224
till I felt ready, so I've been
practicing in my closet.

01:15.259 --> 01:18.194
Tina, do you really think
you're the cheerleader type?

01:18.228 --> 01:19.629
Bob, be supportive.

01:19.630 --> 01:21.631
Come on, what cheer
you gonna do for the tryout?

01:21.632 --> 01:23.933
Let's go, ignite,
the Wagstaff team is dynamite.

01:23.934 --> 01:26.002
Okay, we're ready.
Let's hear you do it.

01:26.036 --> 01:27.904
I just did it.
Oh.

01:27.905 --> 01:29.205
Oh. Of course you did.

01:29.239 --> 01:32.475
Tina, honey, if you don't
make it, it's okay.

01:32.476 --> 01:34.644
In fact, sometimes cheerleaders
are not the nicest people.

01:34.645 --> 01:37.880
What? My friend Monica... one time,
she ditched me at the food court

01:37.881 --> 01:39.782
to hang out with the
other cheerleaders.

01:39.783 --> 01:42.418
(groans) I had so many free
samples of sesame chicken,

01:42.419 --> 01:45.087
I can't eat it to this day.

01:45.122 --> 01:46.722
You ate sesame chicken
last night, Lin.

01:46.757 --> 01:48.157
I know, but I didn't like it.

01:48.158 --> 01:49.892
Damn you, Monica!

01:49.893 --> 01:51.894
Oh, my God. Okay! Gene, Louise,

01:51.895 --> 01:54.130
why don't you go to tryouts
to support Tina?

01:54.131 --> 01:55.574
I'm sure she could use it.

01:55.599 --> 01:56.766
Okay.
Oh, no way. I'm busy.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.402
By the way, with a cartwheel,
are your hands or your face

01:59.403 --> 02:01.104
supposed to touch the ground first?

02:01.138 --> 02:03.206
Actually, I'll make time.

02:03.240 --> 02:05.208
GIRL (unsteadily): <i>We are the Whalers!</i>

02:05.242 --> 02:07.076
It's true!

02:07.077 --> 02:10.645
We're gonna sink our hooks in you!

02:10.646 --> 02:11.981
Whalers!

02:11.982 --> 02:14.117
Oh... God.

02:14.151 --> 02:16.152
Great job.
(quietly): I hate cheerleading.

02:16.153 --> 02:18.154
Her pom-poms make me want to vom-vom.

02:18.155 --> 02:20.757
She's in my math class
and she makes me sad.

02:20.758 --> 02:22.158
I scored her a 4.7.

02:22.159 --> 02:24.093
We don't have a point system, Todd.

02:24.094 --> 02:25.828
I use a personal point system.

02:25.829 --> 02:27.296
Oh, great. Next!

02:27.331 --> 02:29.766
Hi, I'm Tina.
GENE: Yay,

02:29.800 --> 02:31.801
Tina! Go, Tina!

02:31.802 --> 02:33.486
Tina's a wee-na!

02:33.504 --> 02:38.107
Let's go, ignite, the
Wagstaff team is dynamite.

02:38.142 --> 02:39.534
(quietly): Now the big finish.

02:39.543 --> 02:41.310
Ah!
Ah!

02:41.345 --> 02:43.780
(lisping):
I'm okay. I just bit my tongue.

02:43.814 --> 02:45.848
Nailed it!
(whoops)

02:45.849 --> 02:47.817
Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina!

02:47.851 --> 02:50.486
He's got spirit.
I hear it.

02:50.521 --> 02:54.323
(screaming)

02:54.324 --> 02:55.858
Okay, I'm done.

02:55.893 --> 02:57.727
Gene's the Belcher we
should get on the squad.

02:57.728 --> 03:00.563
Wait, I'm the Yell King here,
and I got the guy stuff handled.

03:00.564 --> 03:03.332
I mean, is this a cheer squad
or a male revue?

03:03.333 --> 03:05.334
(laughing nervously) (laughing)

03:05.335 --> 03:07.637
Let's chat with Gene.
Oh.

03:07.638 --> 03:10.139
But Tina was the one
that was trying out.

03:10.140 --> 03:11.641
(lisping): That's okay, Gene.

03:11.642 --> 03:12.942
At least I didn't embarrass myself.

03:12.976 --> 03:14.577
I don't even understand her.

03:14.578 --> 03:17.747
Gene, what do you say?
Are you in or are you in?

03:17.748 --> 03:20.783
Mm, I don't know. I've got
a lot going on after school.

03:20.818 --> 03:23.453
Clearly. I-I'm surprised
he even made time for us today.

03:23.487 --> 03:25.321
Yeah, you'd have to offer me
something pretty sweet

03:25.322 --> 03:27.623
to compete with my afternoon
bath 'n' snack.

03:27.658 --> 03:29.525
Well, there's attention, popularity...

03:29.560 --> 03:30.893
Got it, don't need it.

03:30.928 --> 03:32.562
Silk cheer shorts.
I'm in.

03:32.596 --> 03:34.697
Yay, Gene's a cheerleader!

03:34.732 --> 03:36.599
The prophecy has been fulfilled!

03:38.292 --> 03:40.226
Bob, here come the kids.
I'm sure Tina got bad news.

03:40.227 --> 03:41.761
Just don't overreact.

03:41.795 --> 03:43.396
Why would I overreact?

03:43.397 --> 03:44.764
I'm the one who thinks
cheerleading is silly.

03:44.798 --> 03:46.632
Listen, you can be
a little insensitive.

03:46.633 --> 03:47.934
Just follow my lead.

03:47.968 --> 03:49.969
Tina flew too close to the floor

03:49.970 --> 03:52.138
and hit her face on it...
swollen tongue.

03:52.139 --> 03:54.340
(lisping): It was so much easier
in my closet.

03:54.341 --> 03:56.976
Oh, my God, sweetie.
Aw, your poor tongue.

03:56.977 --> 03:59.479
Who cares if you didn't make
dumb old cheerleader, right?

03:59.480 --> 04:01.491
(bell jingles) You know what?
They can...

04:01.515 --> 04:04.150
Oh, my God!
Gene's a cheerleader!

04:04.184 --> 04:06.753
He's a jo...
Bob, Gene's a cheerleader!

04:06.754 --> 04:08.121
(laughing)

04:08.122 --> 04:09.956
So, Mom doesn't seem to care.

04:09.990 --> 04:12.959
Oh, God, how'd this crazy,
wonderful thing happen to us?

04:12.993 --> 04:14.961
Shh. Just take it in.

04:14.995 --> 04:17.329
(cackles) I'm a cheerleader mom!

04:17.331 --> 04:18.930
Oh, I can't stand it!

04:18.966 --> 04:21.300
Um, obviously your-your
mom is very proud.

04:21.301 --> 04:25.505
Uh, just like she's proud... and
sensitive... about all you kids.

04:25.539 --> 04:26.606
Right, Lin?
What?

04:26.640 --> 04:28.174
Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, Tina.

04:28.175 --> 04:31.110
You want to suck on a bag
of frozen peas or something?

04:31.145 --> 04:33.646
Yeah, that'll help.
I'm sorry, I can't understand you.

04:33.647 --> 04:35.181
Come here, Gene, oh, Gene!

04:35.182 --> 04:36.949
Ooh, let me wear your jacket!

04:36.984 --> 04:39.118
Oh, no, it's too small;
let me put it on my shoulder.

04:39.119 --> 04:40.319
Look at it on my shoulder.

04:40.354 --> 04:41.954
Geez, Tina, that looks bad.

04:41.955 --> 04:44.824
(lisping): The nurse said the swelling
will go down in a couple days.

04:44.825 --> 04:46.292
I'm not really getting
what you just said.

04:46.293 --> 04:47.527
I said the nurse said...

04:47.528 --> 04:48.828
Still not getting it.

04:48.829 --> 04:50.630
The nurse at school said...
Eh...

04:50.631 --> 04:51.864
You know what Tina needs?

04:51.865 --> 04:52.865
An interpreter!

04:52.866 --> 04:54.067
An interpreter?
Oh.

04:54.068 --> 04:55.334
How about me?
I'll do it.

04:55.335 --> 04:56.536
I'll be your interpreter.
No.

04:56.537 --> 04:57.837
I'm hearing "Yes." No.

04:57.838 --> 04:59.005
"Yes," we got that. "Yes." No.

04:59.006 --> 05:00.073
And she says "Yes." No.

05:00.074 --> 05:01.207
And she says "Yes." No.

05:01.241 --> 05:02.642
And she says "Yes."

05:02.643 --> 05:04.077
Well, looks like you've worked it out.

05:04.078 --> 05:05.311
AMBROSE: <i>Listen up.</i>

05:05.312 --> 05:08.614
We're all here because we
wanted this more than anything.

05:08.649 --> 05:10.717
Except me...
I wanted to advise Drama.

05:10.718 --> 05:14.053
But no, Ms. LaBonz got Drama
and I got sis-boom-blah!

05:14.088 --> 05:15.288
Stop yelling.

05:15.322 --> 05:19.492
Anyway, what I am going to do is
inject drama into cheerleading,

05:19.493 --> 05:21.260
with you as my stars!

05:21.261 --> 05:22.695
Hmm?
Gene, you're the new kid.

05:22.730 --> 05:23.996
The raw rookie.

05:23.997 --> 05:25.365
Still breaking in your cheer shorts.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.567
Your arch rival is Todd.
He is?

05:27.568 --> 05:29.769
Yeah, the bitter, boozy old Yell King.

05:29.770 --> 05:31.337
And, Todd, you hate Gene.

05:31.338 --> 05:32.972
He threatens everything you are!
Already there.

05:33.007 --> 05:34.240
What about the rest of us?

05:34.274 --> 05:35.541
I don't know, let's go around.

05:35.542 --> 05:36.642
Who do you hate?

05:36.677 --> 05:39.012
Mm, I feel that I hate Jocelyn,

05:39.013 --> 05:41.014
because I'm the hot one,
and she's the not one.

05:41.015 --> 05:42.715
Whatever.

05:42.716 --> 05:44.851
Tammy farts when anyone
lifts her and it's gross!

05:44.852 --> 05:46.352
It's only when someone lifts me wrong.

05:46.353 --> 05:47.854
Okay, let's go with
the Gene-Todd thing.

05:47.888 --> 05:50.556
You'll never be more
than the bottom of my pyramid.

05:50.557 --> 05:52.025
I'm here...
to cheer.

05:52.026 --> 05:53.226
Get used to it!

05:53.260 --> 05:56.195
LOUISE: <i>So...</i> as Tina's
official interpreter,

05:56.196 --> 05:57.764
I'm gonna have my hands pretty full,

05:57.765 --> 06:00.233
and that means no homework,
unfortunately.

06:00.267 --> 06:01.801
I don't know, Louise.

06:01.802 --> 06:03.369
Frankly, this sounds like
a scheme to miss class.

06:03.404 --> 06:05.338
Yeah, I think so, too.
What's she saying?

06:05.372 --> 06:06.906
Oh, she said she needs me.

06:06.907 --> 06:08.141
I didn't say that.

06:08.142 --> 06:09.842
And "I have a disability,

06:09.877 --> 06:11.244
you insensitive creep." What...

06:11.278 --> 06:14.681
"Give me Louise or I will haul
your white ass into court!"

06:14.715 --> 06:16.916
Okay, okay, okay!
Settle down, Tina!

06:16.917 --> 06:18.551
Whoa, you're upsetting her.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.053
I've never seen her this angry.
I...

06:20.054 --> 06:21.254
Tell her I'm sorry.

06:21.288 --> 06:22.255
She can hear.

06:22.289 --> 06:23.556
Oh. I...

06:23.557 --> 06:25.091
(exaggerated): Sor... ry.

06:25.092 --> 06:26.759
So you like the new you?

06:26.760 --> 06:28.428
Twice the spunk, half the junk.

06:28.429 --> 06:30.430
(lisping): But you're not
really interpreting.

06:30.431 --> 06:31.831
Hi, Tina.
Hi, Jimmy Jr.

06:31.832 --> 06:33.099
You look handsome today.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.635
Yeah, she said, uh, "Keep
walking, dance man.

06:35.636 --> 06:36.970
Take a hint and a breath mint."

06:36.971 --> 06:38.237
All right, that is really harsh.

06:38.238 --> 06:39.472
Wow. Okay, Tina.

06:39.473 --> 06:40.940
Be that way.

06:40.941 --> 06:42.408
The claws are out, huh?
Good-bye.

06:42.443 --> 06:43.776
(laughs) That's it!

06:43.777 --> 06:45.478
Louise, you are not
my interpreter anymore!

06:45.479 --> 06:48.114
You're fired!
Um, okay, so,

06:48.115 --> 06:49.949
if you're trying to play
hard to get, it worked.

06:49.950 --> 06:51.184
You want to go out Friday?

06:51.185 --> 06:52.919
Okay, you can be my interpreter.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.254
(whistle blows) W-A-G-S-T-A-double-F!

06:55.255 --> 06:56.489
Wagstaff!

06:56.490 --> 06:58.291
Gene, shoulder lift Tammy!

06:58.325 --> 06:59.592
(groaning)

06:59.593 --> 07:00.827
(Tammy farts) (coughing)

07:00.828 --> 07:02.962
Well, don't squeeze, newbie!

07:02.963 --> 07:04.197
Don't breathe in, you'll die!

07:04.198 --> 07:06.099
That hasn't been proven 100%.

07:06.133 --> 07:07.634
Gene, two-man pyramid! Now!

07:07.668 --> 07:09.669
(groans) Whalers!

07:09.670 --> 07:11.237
Great, Todd, re-hydrate.

07:11.272 --> 07:12.505
Come on. Sit.

07:12.506 --> 07:13.573
Hwah! Oh, no!

07:13.607 --> 07:14.841
That's my funny bone!

07:14.842 --> 07:16.109
Which is what I call my penis!

07:16.110 --> 07:17.310
Eh, you're hurting it!

07:17.344 --> 07:18.645
We're number one!

07:18.646 --> 07:19.979
Also I have to go number one.

07:19.980 --> 07:21.648
Cheer break!
Hurry back.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.983
Gene, now's your chance to
dramatically step in for Todd.

07:23.984 --> 07:27.086
I've been pumping him full of sport
drink just so he would leave!

07:27.121 --> 07:28.988
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
I don't know if I'm ready!

07:29.023 --> 07:30.290
You're ready!

07:30.291 --> 07:31.691
You have a cheer fire inside you

07:31.692 --> 07:33.293
and it's burning its way out!
Okay.

07:33.327 --> 07:35.495
Squad, follow my lead!

07:35.496 --> 07:37.163
(chanting): You can do it if you try!

07:37.164 --> 07:38.932
Come on, Zeke, pin your guy!

07:38.966 --> 07:41.801
He's gonna taste the sweet defeat
when he sniffs your feet and seat!

07:41.835 --> 07:44.203
Cheer fire!
(crowd cheering)

07:44.238 --> 07:46.172
Hey, the crowd's getting into it!

07:46.173 --> 07:47.974
(groans)

07:47.975 --> 07:49.208
I'm getting pinned!

07:49.209 --> 07:50.977
Oh, crap, I lost.
I hate that!

07:51.011 --> 07:53.246
Look at Gene.
Look at what he's done.

07:53.247 --> 07:55.048
Give me that!
What did you do?

07:55.049 --> 07:56.482
What did <i> you</i> do?

07:56.483 --> 07:57.984
Just pee?
That's right.

07:57.985 --> 08:00.086
Like a coward with a doodle?

08:00.087 --> 08:01.321
He doodled. He doodled!

08:01.322 --> 08:02.722
I didn't doodle, he doodled!

08:02.723 --> 08:04.424
I wouldn't...
Gene, Todd, please!

08:04.425 --> 08:06.226
There's a simple and dramatic
way to handle this.

08:06.260 --> 08:08.995
A head-to-head competition
in a public place

08:08.996 --> 08:10.964
with high stakes and arbitrary rules.

08:10.998 --> 08:13.967
Oh, my God, he's talking about a...

08:14.001 --> 08:15.568
Cheer battle!

08:15.569 --> 08:18.404
Ah!
I knew it, I knew it!

08:18.405 --> 08:20.039
Freestyle rules.

08:20.074 --> 08:22.976
Last cheerleader standing
is the King of the Yells.

08:23.010 --> 08:24.377
It could go either way!

08:24.378 --> 08:26.079
(whispering): I know who's gonna win.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.948
(chanting): Your name is Gene,
you've got heart and soul.

08:28.949 --> 08:32.085
I even like your haircut,
but, hey, where is the bowl?

08:32.086 --> 08:34.220
Oh, no, I did that!
(cheerleaders ooh)

08:34.255 --> 08:35.722
Gene got bowl trolled!

08:35.756 --> 08:37.690
Okay, not bad.
But here's the deal.

08:37.725 --> 08:40.727
(chanting): I mopped up your
spit, I rinsed out your towels,

08:40.760 --> 08:44.430
and when I hear you cheer,
I evacuate my bowels!

08:44.431 --> 08:46.599
(laughs) Ooh!
Boom!

08:46.634 --> 08:49.802
(chanting): Well, you've got no
physique, you're kind of round.

08:49.803 --> 08:52.772
You make not very
good mouth sounds!

08:52.773 --> 08:53.740
Huh?
Ooh...

08:53.774 --> 08:55.208
Hmm. Kind of a thinker.

08:55.242 --> 08:56.709
(throws voice): Good job, Todd.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.711
That was on the money.
Who said that?

08:58.712 --> 09:01.714
(chanting): Your rhymes are meh,
your logic is flawed.

09:01.715 --> 09:04.951
If you're the Yell King,
then I'm the Yell God!

09:04.985 --> 09:06.452
(all whooping) Oh-ho-ho!

09:06.453 --> 09:07.754
I think that was a death blow.

09:07.755 --> 09:08.965
I just got chills.

09:08.989 --> 09:10.256
No, no, no.

09:10.257 --> 09:11.758
Just give me it. Um...

09:11.792 --> 09:13.560
(chanting): You think you're smart,

09:13.561 --> 09:15.228
but you're stupid.

09:15.229 --> 09:16.930
Your cheers are just...

09:16.931 --> 09:18.164
flivvity flovity flupid.

09:18.165 --> 09:19.632
Ska dee ba doo.

09:19.667 --> 09:21.434
That's not cheering, that's scatting.

09:21.435 --> 09:23.136
Get out of here, Steven Tyler!

09:23.170 --> 09:25.405
(grunts) Ah, I give up!

09:25.439 --> 09:27.073
We have a new Yell King!

09:27.074 --> 09:28.641
(cheering) Yeah!

09:28.676 --> 09:30.476
(quietly): Todd, time to
plot your revenge!

09:30.477 --> 09:31.644
Ah!

09:33.792 --> 09:34.892
Okay, here's your lunch, girls.

09:34.893 --> 09:38.162
Oh, Tina, for your lunch, I
smoothied a tuna fish sandwich.

09:38.163 --> 09:39.630
(lisping): Ugh.
That sounds terrible.

09:39.631 --> 09:41.465
"Yum! I love you, Mom.

09:41.466 --> 09:42.966
Make this every day."

09:42.967 --> 09:45.069
Oh, and, Gene,
here's your lunch, honey.

09:45.070 --> 09:50.441
Peppyroni Pizza, Chicken Pom
Pom-adora and a Cheer-liter of soda.

09:50.475 --> 09:52.076
That's about 10,000 calories
of cheer puns.

09:52.077 --> 09:53.050
(Linda whoops)

09:53.078 --> 09:54.178
Thanks, Mom. Bye.

09:54.179 --> 09:55.179
G!
What?

09:55.213 --> 09:56.480
I was giving you a "G."

09:56.481 --> 09:57.781
You looked like you wanted one.
G!

09:57.816 --> 09:58.682
Okay.

09:58.716 --> 09:59.917
E! N! E! Gene!

09:59.918 --> 10:01.151
Oh, my God, Lin.

10:01.186 --> 10:03.020
Well, I-I got to be going.

10:03.021 --> 10:04.221
LINDA: Look, Gene,

10:04.255 --> 10:05.723
I can do a herkie.
Ow!

10:05.724 --> 10:07.391
Uh, sorry.
Lin, just let Gene go to school.

10:07.392 --> 10:08.692
No, let me do it again.
Ow!

10:08.727 --> 10:09.960
Bye, Mom!
LINDA: I can do it better.

10:09.994 --> 10:11.695
(grunting) Ow! Oh.

10:11.730 --> 10:13.330
(panting)

10:13.331 --> 10:15.232
I love you, my perfect little
cheerleader baby!

10:16.901 --> 10:18.335
Hey, Tina.

10:18.336 --> 10:19.570
(lisping): Hey, Jimmy Jr.

10:19.571 --> 10:20.838
Uh, "Hey, idiot."

10:20.839 --> 10:22.740
Ugh, I love it when she's mean.

10:22.741 --> 10:25.309
So have you thought about where
you want to go Friday night?

10:25.343 --> 10:26.744
Wherever you want to go.

10:26.745 --> 10:29.380
She says, "Pie in the Sky, "the
revolving dessert restaurant

10:29.381 --> 10:30.981
at the top of the Spinnaker Hotel."

10:31.015 --> 10:32.049
She didn't say all that.

10:32.083 --> 10:33.384
You're right, I didn't.

10:33.385 --> 10:35.119
"Yes, I did say all that." No.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.521
Listen, it's not my first
choice either, Jimmy Jr.

10:37.555 --> 10:38.689
Wait, you're coming, too?

10:38.723 --> 10:40.891
Yeah, I have to.
It's work.

10:40.892 --> 10:42.893
When her lips are flappin',
I can't be nappin'.

10:42.894 --> 10:44.528
You don't have to go.

10:44.562 --> 10:46.764
What'd she say?
She said bring a lot of money

10:46.765 --> 10:48.165
'cause we're gonna eat a lot of pie.

10:48.199 --> 10:50.234
Oh, man, I guess I could sell my bike.

10:50.235 --> 10:51.502
She's worth it!

10:51.536 --> 10:53.270
Super toe-touch, Tammy.

10:53.304 --> 10:55.372
Great buckets, Jocelyn.

10:55.373 --> 10:57.241
You! Nice job with
the whatever that is.

10:57.242 --> 10:59.777
Todd, pal, how you doing
combing out those pom-poms?

10:59.778 --> 11:02.379
Still some tangles.
Mm-hmm.

11:02.380 --> 11:03.781
You're doing a great job
with the squad, Gene.

11:03.782 --> 11:07.041
Gene is ripe for a fall, and you're
the one who can do it, Todd!

11:07.052 --> 11:09.953
You mean work really hard on my
cheering so that one day, I can...

11:09.954 --> 11:11.689
Yeah, that's it, Todd.
No, get dirty!

11:11.723 --> 11:13.223
So you want me to get dirty?

11:13.224 --> 11:15.426
No, that's not
what we do here. Get dirty!

11:15.460 --> 11:16.894
Yeah, I'm gonna get dirty.

11:16.895 --> 11:18.395
You're telling me
I lost my wrestling match

11:18.396 --> 11:20.064
'cause of Gene's cheerleading?!

11:20.098 --> 11:22.933
He got the crowd on <i> his</i>
side, Zeke, not your side.

11:22.967 --> 11:25.102
Yeah, the crowd perked up,
and next thing you knew,

11:25.103 --> 11:26.804
the other guy's nad was in my eye.

11:26.838 --> 11:29.773
If only someone could convince
Gene to quit the squad.

11:29.808 --> 11:31.742
Do what?!
Maybe someone who had

11:31.743 --> 11:32.943
some muscle.

11:32.977 --> 11:34.645
(laughs)

11:34.646 --> 11:36.413
Oh, I think I see
where you're going with this.

11:36.448 --> 11:37.915
Yup, yup.

11:37.916 --> 11:39.283
(both laugh)

11:39.284 --> 11:40.851
I'm gonna tickle you!

11:40.852 --> 11:42.419
I'm gonna tickle you!
(high-pitched giggling)

11:42.420 --> 11:44.021
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going with this?

11:44.022 --> 11:45.656
(whispering) (gasps)

11:45.657 --> 11:48.292
Oh!

11:49.694 --> 11:51.095
Hang on, don't fall.

11:51.096 --> 11:52.463
What's that?

11:52.497 --> 11:53.931
It's a surprise for Gene.

11:53.932 --> 11:55.499
I designed a cheer stunt
for his squad.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.034
He's gonna love it.

11:57.035 --> 11:59.903
Uh, Lin, do you think with Gene
you're being just a little...

11:59.938 --> 12:01.872
suck-uppy?
Suck-uppy?

12:01.873 --> 12:04.975
I am not a suck up, and I don't
play favorites with my kids.

12:04.976 --> 12:07.044
I love them all, even the
ones who aren't special.

12:07.045 --> 12:09.647
Okay, it's just that... Are you
wearing a cheerleading skirt?

12:09.648 --> 12:11.882
No. It's something I picked
up at the thrift store.

12:11.883 --> 12:14.285
It's a regular short pleated
skirt with stripes on it.

12:14.319 --> 12:16.320
In royal blue.
With a picture of a Viking.

12:16.321 --> 12:17.688
It's comfortable.
Go team!

12:17.722 --> 12:19.657
Was that a cheer?
(laughs): No.

12:19.658 --> 12:20.991
Why would I cheer?

12:21.026 --> 12:23.027
(sighs) My pep is pooped.

12:23.061 --> 12:25.195
All I want to do is eat a huge dinner

12:25.196 --> 12:27.031
and go straight to bed
and get up later

12:27.032 --> 12:29.767
for my 1:00 a.m. cheese plate
and then right back to bed.

12:29.801 --> 12:31.802
Gene, come look at my cheer stunt!

12:31.836 --> 12:33.971
Six cheerleaders sit piggyback
on each other in a tower.

12:33.972 --> 12:35.806
Mm.

12:35.840 --> 12:39.643
And then they all roll at once
in a giant cartwheel. Oh, oh.

12:39.678 --> 12:41.378
Whoops, whoops. No,
don't-don't worry about that. (groans)

12:41.379 --> 12:43.681
Look, I made a flip book
out of a sticky pad.

12:43.715 --> 12:45.482
Whoa! Ah!

12:45.517 --> 12:46.917
I call it the Pig Wheel.

12:46.918 --> 12:48.319
Get it?
(groans)

12:48.320 --> 12:49.720
Huh? So you like it?

12:49.754 --> 12:52.556
That's a great idea...
on planet Crazy Cheer!

12:52.557 --> 12:54.124
We'd all die!

12:54.159 --> 12:55.893
No, no, look at the flip book.

12:55.927 --> 12:58.028
It's crazy,
and you're driving me crazy!

12:58.029 --> 13:00.097
What? I'm just being
part of your cheerleading.

13:00.098 --> 13:02.666
You're not a cheerleader,
and you never will be!

13:02.667 --> 13:04.068
(gasps) Oh, I knew it!

13:04.069 --> 13:05.669
You're just like Monica!

13:05.670 --> 13:07.705
I hope so because Monica sounds great!

13:07.706 --> 13:09.506
I wish I could have cheered with her!

13:09.541 --> 13:11.081
(gasps) You!

13:11.109 --> 13:12.843
Forget dinner.
I'm going to bed!

13:12.844 --> 13:14.845
But I'll still be up
for the cheese plate!

13:14.846 --> 13:17.648
And we better not be
out of toast points!

13:17.682 --> 13:19.083
(bells jingle)

13:19.084 --> 13:20.517
Lin? You okay?
(grunts)

13:20.518 --> 13:22.086
Gene's not my favorite anymore!

13:22.087 --> 13:24.255
I'll go make his cheese plate.

13:25.757 --> 13:27.591
(humming)

13:27.592 --> 13:29.693
Hell-o.
Hello.

13:29.728 --> 13:32.363
(screaming) (yelling)

13:32.364 --> 13:34.398
(grunting) (whimpering)

13:34.399 --> 13:35.399
This is a warning!

13:35.400 --> 13:38.769
You quit cheerleading, or I'm
coming back for the other nurple!

13:38.803 --> 13:41.872
Why?! Why?!

13:41.873 --> 13:43.641
Also, this isn't Zeke.
This is someone else.

13:43.642 --> 13:45.609
And you can't tell who

13:45.610 --> 13:47.745
'cause I'm wearing a jockstrap
across my face. Got to go.

13:47.779 --> 13:49.914
Got math.
Quit the squad!

13:49.948 --> 13:51.482
Look at this nurple!
It's purple!

13:51.483 --> 13:53.123
Well, I didn't do it!

13:53.151 --> 13:55.786
Well, someone did!
All I know is it wasn't Zeke!

13:55.787 --> 13:57.755
So I guess you're
quitting. Keep in touch.

13:57.756 --> 13:59.857
I'll never quit, or keep in touch!

13:59.891 --> 14:02.226
Everyone quiet!
I have a dramatic announcement.

14:02.227 --> 14:04.828
As a joke, I submitted a tape
of this squad

14:04.829 --> 14:06.597
to the state cheer association.

14:06.598 --> 14:09.033
This morning, I got a call.

14:09.067 --> 14:11.101
Is that it?
Is that the announcement,

14:11.102 --> 14:12.469
or is there...?
Oh, shh!

14:12.470 --> 14:14.104
I was pausing for effect!

14:14.105 --> 14:17.541
You've been selected for Regional
Cheer Finals on Kingshead Island!

14:17.576 --> 14:18.576
We made the finals!

14:18.577 --> 14:20.411
Oh, my God, finals!

14:20.445 --> 14:22.813
I didn't even know about them,
but now we're going!

14:22.848 --> 14:24.148
Oh, and it's tomorrow,
and you need a brand-new,

14:24.149 --> 14:25.482
groundbreaking, original routine.

14:25.483 --> 14:27.051
Don't look at me.
I'm busy!

14:27.085 --> 14:30.321
What?! Oh, my God,
that's, like, impossible!

14:30.322 --> 14:33.157
To win in finals, we'd have
to be ahead of our time.

14:33.158 --> 14:35.292
Or be <i> from</i> ahead of our time.

14:35.293 --> 14:36.694
What?

14:36.695 --> 14:38.128
We could be cheer-bots.

14:38.129 --> 14:40.297
In robot costumes
with robot cheer moves.

14:40.298 --> 14:41.832
(robotic voice): Beep bop boop.

14:41.833 --> 14:44.935
We will use our laser beam
to annihilate your team.

14:44.936 --> 14:46.270
Mm-mm, mm.

14:46.304 --> 14:48.205
That... is...
I can't make up my mind.

14:48.206 --> 14:49.607
It's either genius or crap.

14:49.641 --> 14:51.041
It's crap.
Todd hates it.

14:51.042 --> 14:52.443
That means it's genius!

14:52.444 --> 14:54.712
Yay, cheer-bots!
(excited chatter)

14:54.713 --> 14:55.813
GENE: <i>Mom, Dad!</i>

14:55.847 --> 14:57.148
Come on, I can't be late!

14:57.149 --> 14:58.649
This is the regional finals!

14:58.650 --> 15:00.551
All right, keep your shorts on,
Short Circuit.

15:00.552 --> 15:02.486
Hmm.
Lin, come on. Be nice.

15:02.521 --> 15:03.521
Sorry, Bob.

15:03.522 --> 15:04.788
Still kind of miffed at Gene.

15:04.789 --> 15:07.458
Frankly, I'd rather be with Tina
on her big date at Pie in the Sky.

15:07.459 --> 15:08.959
Poor Louise.
She's probably feeling

15:08.960 --> 15:10.761
like a third wheel right about now.

15:10.795 --> 15:12.596
LOUISE: <i>Ha-ha, look at me!</i>

15:12.631 --> 15:14.965
The world is literally
revolving around me!

15:15.000 --> 15:19.937
Okay, we have the pie-stravaganza
party platter and three forks.

15:19.971 --> 15:22.706
Thank you, thank you,
and that's my backup fork.

15:22.741 --> 15:24.074
(lisping): Can I get some water?

15:24.075 --> 15:26.177
She said, "We are barely revolving."

15:26.178 --> 15:29.713
Let's turn this lazy Susan
into a crazy Susan, okay?

15:29.748 --> 15:32.550
Um, it revolves
at a speed that's designed

15:32.551 --> 15:35.052
for the comfort of our diners,
so we can't really...

15:35.053 --> 15:37.354
Jimmy, he wants ten bucks.
Grease him.

15:37.355 --> 15:38.889
(groans): Oh, God, okay.

15:38.890 --> 15:41.058
Oh, I'll talk to my pals
in the engine room.

15:41.092 --> 15:44.395
We want pies flying
off the table, buddy.

15:44.396 --> 15:46.530
Oh! You feel that?

15:46.531 --> 15:47.531
Not really.

15:47.566 --> 15:49.066
Oh, yeah!

15:49.100 --> 15:52.169
Lovebirds, hold on to your nests!

15:54.039 --> 15:57.374
BOB: So, Lin, when cheerleaders
compete, who cheers for them?

15:57.409 --> 15:59.009
Football players?
What?

15:59.010 --> 16:01.712
I was... I was making a joke.

16:01.713 --> 16:02.913
(gasps)

16:02.914 --> 16:04.181
Bob, I don't believe it!

16:04.182 --> 16:05.349
What?

16:05.383 --> 16:07.174
Hello, Monica.
It's Linda.

16:07.185 --> 16:08.519
Linda, I...

16:08.520 --> 16:10.254
No. No, I'm going first, Monica.

16:10.288 --> 16:11.689
You hurt me a long time ago.

16:11.690 --> 16:14.225
But you can't hurt me anymore, Missy.

16:14.259 --> 16:16.093
I'm so sorry.
I don't remember you.

16:16.128 --> 16:19.764
Ooh, that hurts. Ooh, that hurts!
Oh, it hurts!

16:19.798 --> 16:22.266
Oh! Linda from high school.

16:22.267 --> 16:23.934
Do you have a child competing here?

16:23.969 --> 16:25.569
Yeah, that's my son Gene down there.

16:25.570 --> 16:28.305
Oh, my gosh.
He looks just like you.

16:28.306 --> 16:30.074
Well, he acts just like you.

16:30.075 --> 16:32.276
A cold, unfeeling,
dead-inside cheer-bot!

16:32.277 --> 16:33.277
Oh.

16:33.278 --> 16:35.112
So, uh, hey, I'm Bob.

16:35.147 --> 16:36.547
Guys, I think we got this thing.

16:36.548 --> 16:39.550
Yeah! We go on last, and so far
there hasn't been anything

16:39.551 --> 16:42.953
half as good as Cheer-Bots
from the Year 2525!

16:42.954 --> 16:46.257
ANNOUNCER: And now, Melvin Laird
Middle School presents

16:46.291 --> 16:48.359
the robot cheer team from the future!

16:48.393 --> 16:51.429
CHEERLEADERS (chanting):
Beep, boop, gleep, glorp!

16:51.463 --> 16:53.230
Beep, boop, gleep, glorp!

16:53.231 --> 16:56.267
(all screaming)

16:56.301 --> 16:59.804
Melvin Laird stole our routine!

17:01.344 --> 17:04.546
Those are our semi-erotic robotics,
and Melvin Laird stole them!

17:04.547 --> 17:06.515
Or someone here leaked it to them!

17:06.516 --> 17:08.050
But who would do that?
Who would do something like that?

17:08.050 --> 17:09.402
Give up? It was me!

17:09.419 --> 17:12.020
Wha...?!
Why, Mr. Ambrose? Why?

17:12.055 --> 17:13.689
Because having your cheers
stolen five minutes

17:13.690 --> 17:15.490
before you perform
is incredibly dramatic!

17:15.491 --> 17:17.459
Now you really have to scramble!

17:17.492 --> 17:19.461
You are the worst cheer adviser.

17:19.494 --> 17:21.029
LOUISE: <i>Someone burp me.</i>

17:21.064 --> 17:22.196
Is that weird?

17:22.198 --> 17:23.531
I really need it.

17:23.566 --> 17:25.032
(lisping): Louise, let's go already.

17:25.068 --> 17:26.568
"Louise, more pie"?

17:26.569 --> 17:28.871
I may throw up,
but let's roll the dice!

17:28.905 --> 17:30.706
No! Stop interpreting!

17:30.707 --> 17:32.875
This whole date
has been about you, not me!

17:32.909 --> 17:35.377
Jimmy Jr., I don't know
if you can understand me,

17:35.411 --> 17:36.912
but this is the date I wanted.

17:36.913 --> 17:39.548
We'd watch a movie...
probably <i>27 Dresses...</i>

17:39.549 --> 17:41.850
then we'd walk along
the beach at low tide

17:41.851 --> 17:44.620
and find a cozy place
to sit in the kelp and kiss.

17:44.621 --> 17:46.288
I heard every word, Tina.

17:46.289 --> 17:48.190
That's the same date I wanted, too.

17:48.191 --> 17:49.625
Except that movie... I've
seen it three times.

17:49.626 --> 17:51.894
So, that's 81 dresses total.

17:51.928 --> 17:53.428
Okay, I'm gonna be honest.

17:53.429 --> 17:54.963
I can't really understand
either of you.

17:54.964 --> 17:56.565
(both mumbling)

17:56.566 --> 17:57.966
Ow.

17:57.967 --> 17:59.701
Oh, now I'm definitely gonna be sick.

17:59.702 --> 18:00.736
(retches)

18:00.770 --> 18:02.604
(sighs) It's okay.

18:02.605 --> 18:04.373
No one's gonna know who did that.

18:04.407 --> 18:05.741
TAMMY: <i>Guys, guys, guys, huddle up.</i>

18:05.775 --> 18:07.409
Maybe it's enough that we're

18:07.410 --> 18:10.112
robots from a different
year in the future, right?

18:10.113 --> 18:11.980
It's not. It's over.

18:11.981 --> 18:13.582
There's one thing we can try.

18:13.583 --> 18:15.951
It's called The Pig Wheel.

18:15.952 --> 18:18.587
It's never been accomplished
before except by stick figures.

18:18.588 --> 18:20.923
I don't want to be "that guy,"
but if we do that,

18:20.924 --> 18:23.091
we're all gonna die a tragic
death in front of our families.

18:23.092 --> 18:25.928
Stop, no, I never meant it
to come to this! It's too risky!

18:25.929 --> 18:27.296
Do it! Do it!

18:27.297 --> 18:29.331
The person at the bottom
might be crushed.

18:29.332 --> 18:30.799
I volunteer.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.267
No, Gene.

18:32.268 --> 18:33.735
We had our problems,
but your passion and charisma

18:33.736 --> 18:35.137
are the reason we're even here.

18:35.138 --> 18:37.906
You deserve the top.
I'll be the bottom.

18:37.941 --> 18:40.476
Then I went to college on
a cheerleading scholarship. Mm-hmm.

18:40.477 --> 18:43.378
I was even was a professional
cheerleader for a while.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.013
Well, my life turned out great, too!

18:45.014 --> 18:46.949
Yeah, I get all the
hamburgers I want for free!

18:46.950 --> 18:49.151
And French fries!
Show her, Bob!

18:49.185 --> 18:50.953
Uh, show her what?
Well, sometimes

18:50.954 --> 18:52.488
you got French fries in your pockets.

18:52.489 --> 18:55.457
No, I don't. I d...
Oh, wait, there is one.

18:55.458 --> 18:57.960
Um, I-I don't know how that got there.

18:57.961 --> 19:00.028
Well, I'll eat it.
It's pretty cool, huh?

19:00.029 --> 19:01.497
Pretty cool!

19:01.531 --> 19:04.767
ANNOUNCER:
Let's hear it for Melvin Laird!

19:04.768 --> 19:06.535
That routine definitely computes.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.637
Now up, Wagstaff!

19:08.671 --> 19:10.839
Hey, what the heck is that?

19:10.874 --> 19:13.108
I shouldn't have said
I'd be on the bottom.

19:13.143 --> 19:14.676
Oh, my God, they're
doing my Pig Wheel!

19:14.677 --> 19:16.178
I'm a cheerleader!

19:16.179 --> 19:18.580
Yay, Gene!
You're my favorite again!

19:18.615 --> 19:20.182
Mama loves you, baby!

19:20.216 --> 19:22.284
Lin, this is crazy.
Gene is way up there.

19:22.318 --> 19:24.286
There's no way that's safe.
(whoops)

19:24.320 --> 19:27.523
Okay, everybody, now we're
gonna roll in a big wheel.

19:27.557 --> 19:28.624
We go on my count.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.160
One... two...

19:31.161 --> 19:32.828
(farts) That wasn't me!

19:32.829 --> 19:34.196
(cheerleaders gasping)

19:38.368 --> 19:40.536
Oh, no.
They're gonna fall. Gene!

19:40.537 --> 19:43.038
I'll catch you!
I'll catch you!

19:43.073 --> 19:44.873
(all yell)

19:44.874 --> 19:48.377
So many knees and elbows!
(groaning)

19:48.411 --> 19:51.413
Get off! Get off! Get off!

19:51.414 --> 19:52.548
Thanks, Mr. Ambrose.

19:52.549 --> 19:54.183
That was really, really sweet.

19:54.184 --> 19:57.019
Mr. Ambrose, you saved us! Why?

19:57.053 --> 20:00.022
Because five minutes ago, I started
to really care about you kids.

20:00.023 --> 20:01.423
What a twist!

20:01.424 --> 20:03.827
The jaded cheer advisor
has a heart of gold!

20:03.860 --> 20:05.561
Well, we still lost.

20:05.562 --> 20:08.997
Todd, if the judges saw
what I saw, you're gonna win.

20:08.998 --> 20:10.833
So, last place.
Mm-hmm.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.601
And you got a trophy.

20:12.602 --> 20:14.570
You get a trophy for last place?
Yeah.

20:14.571 --> 20:15.838
At least no one was killed, right?

20:15.839 --> 20:17.506
Nope.
So, that's also good.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.508
I don't care if I'm okay.
Carry me off!

20:19.509 --> 20:22.678
It's more dramatic!
(dramatic groaning)

20:22.712 --> 20:24.713
Sorry, I said you weren't
a cheerleader, Mom.

20:24.748 --> 20:26.215
I'm sorry, too, Gene.

20:26.216 --> 20:28.050
I was trying to cheerlead through you.

20:28.051 --> 20:29.551
And I still am.

20:29.552 --> 20:32.087
Here's a new stunt...
a pyramid of kids

20:32.122 --> 20:33.355
with a kid on top spinning

20:33.356 --> 20:34.690
another kid around like a windmill.

20:34.724 --> 20:35.858
Go on.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.226
I call it The Daffy Dutchman.

20:37.227 --> 20:39.361
Stop.
Let's give it a shot right now.

20:39.362 --> 20:41.096
Squad!
Mom, walk us through it.

20:41.097 --> 20:43.365
No!
Ready. Okay.

20:43.366 --> 20:44.433
No!

20:44.467 --> 20:45.868
JIMMY JR.: <i>Man.</i>

20:45.902 --> 20:47.403
Are we ever gonna get the check?

20:47.404 --> 20:48.537
Oh, hey look.

20:48.538 --> 20:49.738
Here comes my vomit again.

20:49.739 --> 20:51.273
Hi, vomit.

20:51.274 --> 20:53.242
LINDA (singsongy):
We got spirit on our team!

20:53.243 --> 20:55.444
That's gr-reat!

20:55.445 --> 20:57.780
You got spirit on your team!

20:57.781 --> 21:00.482
That's gr-reat!

21:00.483 --> 21:02.484
(grunting)

21:05.388 --> 21:07.589
(grunting)

21:07.590 --> 21:08.957
Fight!
