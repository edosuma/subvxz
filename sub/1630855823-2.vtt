00:13.013 --> 00:14.347
Who are you?

00:24.983 --> 00:27.235
Why the hell do you have this watch?

00:27.318 --> 00:30.739
I heard Taeho died
while hanging out with you guys.

00:44.669 --> 00:46.880
Taeho never told me he had a cousin.

00:48.089 --> 00:52.343
So did you find who killed Taeho or not?

00:52.427 --> 00:54.012
Is that why you're here?

00:55.055 --> 00:56.389
We're looking for him now.

00:56.473 --> 01:00.643
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

01:00.727 --> 01:01.853
What did you just say?

01:01.936 --> 01:03.646
-Hey.
-Fucking hell.

01:03.730 --> 01:04.731
Don't.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.572
(JUNMO SIGHS)

01:14.365 --> 01:18.745
Why the hell are you suddenly
looking for Taeho after all this time?

01:18.828 --> 01:20.288
That's none of your business.

01:21.623 --> 01:25.919
What the hell have you been doing?

01:26.002 --> 01:27.879
Your friend's fucking dead.

01:28.713 --> 01:32.217
Just watching you morons drives me nuts.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.552
You fucking asshole.

01:34.636 --> 01:38.139
So?

01:38.223 --> 01:41.309
Are you really Taeho's friends?

01:41.392 --> 01:42.644
Are you?

01:48.233 --> 01:50.777
Well, what should I expect
from you scumbags?

01:51.277 --> 01:52.278
Right?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.202
Where are you going?

01:59.869 --> 02:02.330
To find the bastard
who killed Taeho, obviously.

02:02.914 --> 02:03.915
And then?

02:03.998 --> 02:05.416
I'll rip him into pieces.

02:13.883 --> 02:16.136
Come by my office sometime.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.387
Let's talk about Taeho.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.146
Move!

02:31.818 --> 02:34.070
Are you really going to
let him go like that?

02:47.125 --> 02:48.251
How did it go?

02:48.918 --> 02:50.378
He invited me to his office.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.131
Hey.

02:53.214 --> 02:54.465
Yeah?

02:54.549 --> 02:57.135
My acting's pretty fucking good.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.345
(CHUCKLES) Idiot.

03:04.434 --> 03:08.897
THE WORST OF EVIL

03:15.570 --> 03:18.114
GICHEUL: I went to Taeho's columbarium
last week.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.450
The building is new and well-maintained,

03:21.159 --> 03:22.493
so it was comforting.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.455
By the way,

03:26.623 --> 03:29.542
why do you think Taeho
never mentioned his cousin to us?

03:42.222 --> 03:44.432
Why didn't you just keep the watch?

03:45.475 --> 03:47.227
What am I going to do with that?

03:49.687 --> 03:51.898
I don't see any photos of them together.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.234
MAN: Seungho.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.363
I haven't heard from him
since he joined the fishing crew,

03:58.446 --> 04:00.949
but he recently came back
and asked me about Taeho.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.244
My brother lived in Wonju.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.038
When Taeho was in elementary school,

04:07.121 --> 04:10.124
he'd stay with Seungho there
every summer vacation.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.711
They were always together, like twins.

04:13.795 --> 04:14.796
So imagine

04:16.256 --> 04:21.469
how shocking it must've been for him
to hear about Taeho.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.984
I haven't used a single cent
of the money you gave me.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.443
Take it and leave.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.659
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

04:45.326 --> 04:46.869
And...

04:48.371 --> 04:51.124
never come back.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.793
Seeing you reminds me of Taeho

04:55.128 --> 04:59.007
and makes me resent you.

05:12.520 --> 05:16.024
The variable in this plan is
they could talk to Taeho's father

05:16.107 --> 05:18.067
to do a background check on me.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.861
Please be prepared for it.

Those punks.

06:04.781 --> 06:05.948
Hey.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.786
Don't just stand there. Have a seat.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.091
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

06:25.051 --> 06:26.844
I've been doing some thinking.

06:28.971 --> 06:32.100
A cousin who had been completely
out of touch suddenly shows up

06:32.183 --> 06:34.394
and causes a ruckus.

06:34.977 --> 06:37.063
What do you think about this situation?

06:40.983 --> 06:42.944
I see your intentions.
(SNAPS FINGERS)

06:46.864 --> 06:47.949
Take it.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.869
And stop using his name to scam people.

06:52.495 --> 06:55.706
You may be his family,
but there's a limit to my patience. Okay?

06:57.291 --> 06:58.793
Take that and get lost.

06:58.876 --> 07:01.838
You low lives really are
nothing more than thugs.

07:01.921 --> 07:02.964
What did you say?

07:04.590 --> 07:06.759
Did you think

07:08.469 --> 07:12.765
I'd just happily take
the money and leave, you fuckers?

07:12.849 --> 07:14.517
You son of a bitch.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.852
No, don't.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.645
I've had it. Come here.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.147
-Please just...
-What?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.607
You've had it? Okay, bring it on.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.528
You want to find out
what happens next?

07:26.070 --> 07:27.071
(CLATTERING)

07:28.489 --> 07:30.825
Fuck you, you two-bit thug.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.417
Seriously, this again?

07:40.293 --> 07:41.752
Move, you asshole.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.385
Not all of you, you morons.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.636
We're no small-time thugs.

07:56.392 --> 07:57.435
Yongdae.

07:57.518 --> 07:58.519
YONGDAE: Yes, sir.

08:04.609 --> 08:05.985
You fucking...

08:06.986 --> 08:08.154
Motherfucker!

08:09.071 --> 08:11.324
(ALL GRUNTING)

08:20.416 --> 08:21.876
You fuckers!

08:30.676 --> 08:31.844
Asshole!

08:34.805 --> 08:36.349
Fuck.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.018
Clean it up, boys.

08:40.394 --> 08:41.479
Yes, sir.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.564
You fucking proud of that?

08:46.108 --> 08:47.693
(GROANS)

08:50.655 --> 08:52.657
Who kicked me just now?

09:02.875 --> 09:03.960
You bastards.

09:05.920 --> 09:06.921
Get down here.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.464
You fucking little...

09:11.801 --> 09:12.885
Motherfuckers.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.681
You piece of shit.

09:16.764 --> 09:20.643
You worthless piece of shit!

09:24.522 --> 09:25.731
Hey!

09:27.233 --> 09:28.734
You fucking bastard.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.362
Fuck!

09:34.574 --> 09:35.741
You fucker...

09:43.249 --> 09:46.419
Get off me, you bastard!

09:48.504 --> 09:50.756
You asshole.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.174
You piece of shit.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.843
You little

09:54.635 --> 09:56.470
piece of...

09:56.554 --> 09:57.638
GICHEUL: Enough!

10:13.821 --> 10:15.781
I see you're not here because of money.

10:17.491 --> 10:20.870
You son of a bitch.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.373
Hey.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.668
Listen, you fucker.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.420
Do you know what my uncle said

10:30.463 --> 10:33.257
when he put Taeho's watch on my wrist?

10:34.592 --> 10:37.678
He said as long as this
is on my wrist, I'm with Taeho,

10:37.762 --> 10:40.014
so forget about revenge.

10:41.515 --> 10:42.683
But you know what?

10:44.685 --> 10:47.480
Since Taeho thought you pricks
were his friends,

10:47.563 --> 10:49.899
I feel so fucking bad for him.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.570
I'm...

10:56.030 --> 10:59.075
going to do whatever it takes
to get revenge for Taeho.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.409
Okay?

11:01.619 --> 11:03.788
You damn two-bit thugs.

11:05.247 --> 11:09.377
Just clean this place up
and stay fucking put.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.129
Because I'll bring you

11:12.213 --> 11:15.049
the head of the bastard who killed Taeho.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.808
(EXHALES WITH FRUSTRATION)

11:26.310 --> 11:28.312
You disloyal assholes.

11:48.332 --> 11:50.000
Was his name Kwon Seungho?

11:50.084 --> 11:51.377
Yes. Why?

11:52.628 --> 11:54.088
Should we ask him to join us?

11:55.047 --> 11:57.007
We can think of him as Taeho.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.885
(SNORTS) What are you saying?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.304
You saw how good he was.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.015
Wouldn't it be nice to have

12:05.099 --> 12:07.601
someone other than Chief Seo
who's a good fighter?

12:07.685 --> 12:08.728
How can we trust him?

12:08.811 --> 12:11.856
He said he's Taeho's cousin.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.441
Heesung.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.027
Since when did you trust people so easily?

12:17.486 --> 12:18.654
Come on.

12:19.196 --> 12:20.531
What the fuck did you say?

12:23.284 --> 12:24.493
You know what I mean.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.413
What we're doing isn't ordinary.

12:27.496 --> 12:28.956
So let's be careful, okay?

12:29.039 --> 12:30.624
And stop being so thoughtless.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.543
You disrespectful bastard.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.671
Hey.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.632
You're finding faults
in everything I say lately.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.260
Well, what else is there to find?
God damn it.

12:41.343 --> 12:42.470
"God damn it"?

12:42.553 --> 12:44.430
"God damn it"?

12:44.555 --> 12:45.765
GICHEUL: Hey.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.893
Hurry and go to work.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.648
Fine. Do whatever the fuck you want.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.219
Hello, sir. Have you seen
this person before?

13:25.012 --> 13:26.388
-Hello, sir.
-MAN: Hello.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.473
Have you seen...

13:27.556 --> 13:31.227
Wasn't it awesome yesterday?
It was so fucking good.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.311
Yesterday...

13:32.394 --> 13:33.521
What?

13:35.940 --> 13:37.191
Isn't that Kwon Seungho?

13:37.733 --> 13:39.443
-That punk...
-Hey!

13:40.027 --> 13:42.613
-What? Let go of me.
-Come on!

13:43.030 --> 13:44.365
Follow me.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.244
-Hello.
-MAN: Hello.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.287
What was he asking about?

13:50.371 --> 13:54.333
It was something about this flyer.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.252
WANTED: MURDER SUSPECT

13:56.669 --> 13:59.088
-If you see him, call the police.
-Some soup please.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.339
-Thank you.
-Come on.

14:00.422 --> 14:01.715
Bye.

14:01.799 --> 14:02.842
JUNMO: Hello, sir.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.426
Have you seen this person?

14:04.510 --> 14:06.971
If you see him,
please report him to the police.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.889
That bastard...

14:10.432 --> 14:12.685
Please report him to the police.
Thank you.

14:19.650 --> 14:23.279
BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA

14:50.180 --> 14:51.348
-Give it.
-Yes, boss.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.275
Well done.

15:02.484 --> 15:03.485
For lunch.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.237
Thank you, boss.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.242
GUARD: Go.

15:31.639 --> 15:32.681
Long time no see.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.099
You bastard!

15:35.976 --> 15:37.227
You damn motherfucker!

15:37.311 --> 15:38.771
All right, hold on.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.815
Calm down and hear me out.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.235
I came here without telling Gicheul

15:45.319 --> 15:47.029
to talk about something important.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.201
You and I clicked so well,

15:52.284 --> 15:54.286
so I've always wished we were friends.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.498
But there was a hierarchy back then.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.084
Hey.

16:00.709 --> 16:04.964
Stop beating around the bush
and get to the point.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.467
I'll listen and see if I'll stick
my knife into your stomach or not.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.552
Have you heard the rumor

16:10.636 --> 16:13.263
that Gicheul is raking in
a fortune these days?

16:13.347 --> 16:17.810
Don't ask me questions
and say what you have to say.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.396
Every month,
he sends the boss tens of millions.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.189
So imagine how much he actually earns.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.858
And guess how money has changed him.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.986
He looks down on others now.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.821
He thinks everyone's beneath him.

16:28.904 --> 16:32.199
We've been friends for 10 years
and he treats me like a slave.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.493
You pathetic pieces of shit.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.705
It's so fucking embarrassing.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.124
Hando.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.085
Let's join forces and take Gicheul down.

16:45.295 --> 16:48.215
For you, it's a chance to get back

16:48.298 --> 16:50.217
what was once yours in style.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.928
Let's cut him down
to put him out of commission

16:53.012 --> 16:55.514
and take over his businesses.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.808
I know how it runs inside and out.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.352
You piece of shit.

17:00.436 --> 17:03.480
You came all the way here
to stab your friend in the back?

17:09.778 --> 17:13.741
We didn't have a wedding,
but my girlfriend's eight months pregnant.

17:14.366 --> 17:18.162
I'm going to be the breadwinner,
so shouldn't I dream big?

17:19.580 --> 17:22.666
You can ask the boss
for permission in advance

17:22.750 --> 17:24.710
and assemble the old Busan gang again.

17:24.793 --> 17:27.504
Then, I'll have things ready in Gangnam.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.673
It can't be that hard.

17:42.019 --> 17:45.272
AUTOMATED VOICE: To record a voicemail,
please press two.

17:45.939 --> 17:48.067
-Please record your message.
-(BEEP)

17:48.150 --> 17:50.569
Euijeong, I'm in Daegu now.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.656
One of the murder suspects fled this way.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.327
I'll have to stay here
and stake him out until we catch him.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.080
Don't worry too much.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.209
I'll leave you another message.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.719
What took you so long?

18:16.678 --> 18:18.305
I got stuck in traffic.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.853
Pour me a drink.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.118
Please give us your consent.
We promise we won't fail.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.411
We are direct subordinates
from the family,

18:41.495 --> 18:43.622
and they're just dancing monkeys
from Gangnam.

18:43.747 --> 18:44.748
(LAUGHS SARDONICALLY)

18:45.082 --> 18:47.167
So why were you crushed by those monkeys?

18:47.751 --> 18:51.505
Was it because you're stupid?

18:51.588 --> 18:55.634
Or was it because
you were especially stupid on that day?

18:59.388 --> 19:02.516
It is true you are direct subordinates,

19:03.058 --> 19:05.936
but Gicheul sends me money
every month without fail.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.938
And my sworn brother in Japan

19:08.730 --> 19:11.066
adores him too,
saying no one should touch him.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.237
And to be honest,

19:16.488 --> 19:18.365
if you take over that area,

19:19.658 --> 19:21.827
it won't make much difference to me.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.621
You know Hong Heesung, right?

19:24.705 --> 19:27.624
He's with us now.
We're sure we can do it this time.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.335
If you let us take over Gangnam,

19:31.170 --> 19:33.255
we'll give you twice as much every month.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.468
Jung Gicheul.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.846
JUNG GICHEUL

19:43.056 --> 19:45.350
-Jung Gicheul.
-(PAGER BEEPS)

19:55.986 --> 19:57.821
This is Jung Gicheul. Let's meet.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.380
Wasn't there a rock club here before?

20:15.797 --> 20:19.301
It closed and was empty,
so we took it over.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.930
Gicheul said the area
needs more youth to thrive,

20:23.013 --> 20:24.473
so he's opening a new one.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.726
That stupid DJ really loves
dancing and partying.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.231
On days we sign contracts,

20:32.314 --> 20:35.275
it's tradition for all of us to gather
and celebrate.

20:36.276 --> 20:37.736
And that party is tonight.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.030
Is everything ready?

20:41.031 --> 20:42.658
Of course.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.451
It'll be a perfect crime.

20:45.285 --> 20:48.622
The boys are hiding
in three separate motels,

20:49.248 --> 20:52.417
and when it's time later on,

20:52.501 --> 20:55.379
they'll all swarm in together.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.632
And to keep them hidden,

20:58.715 --> 21:00.175
only one will have weapons, right?

21:00.717 --> 21:01.843
Of course.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.847
Should I take them in advance

21:05.931 --> 21:07.683
and hide them inside?

21:10.978 --> 21:12.104
If you want to.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.481
Listen.

21:14.564 --> 21:17.401
There will be a small bar near the stage.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.027
I'll put them under it.

21:20.445 --> 21:21.446
All right.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.366
One more thing.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.118
What?

21:28.453 --> 21:31.123
They're all my friends and brothers.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.250
So please

21:34.209 --> 21:36.044
don't hurt them too much

21:36.128 --> 21:37.963
and make sure nothing bad happens.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.382
(SNICKERS) What the hell?

21:41.466 --> 21:42.968
That'll depend on you.

21:43.051 --> 21:46.388
I'm not sure if we could guarantee that.

21:46.471 --> 21:47.597
Let's go.

21:47.681 --> 21:48.849
Yes, sir.

22:37.105 --> 22:38.190
What the...

23:00.879 --> 23:03.340
Hando, please.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.053
You found the place all right.

23:10.514 --> 23:11.848
What is this place?

23:12.307 --> 23:13.642
What are you trying to pull?

23:13.725 --> 23:15.560
We're having a party here tonight.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.105
A party for Taeho.

23:19.314 --> 23:22.776
I don't have time for your crazy bullshit.

23:22.859 --> 23:23.860
A party?

23:27.948 --> 23:31.785
I hear you're looking
for the guy who killed Taeho.

23:33.745 --> 23:34.996
Give that up,

23:35.914 --> 23:37.541
and join my gang.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.378
I'm making this offer
only because you're Taeho's cousin.

23:58.311 --> 23:59.896
You want me to join your gang?

24:04.609 --> 24:05.652
Yeah?

24:08.029 --> 24:09.656
What about revenge for Taeho?

24:11.783 --> 24:12.784
Let's go.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.220
(CAMERA SNAPPING)

24:34.347 --> 24:36.349
MAN: Hey, Gicheul!

24:39.436 --> 24:40.812
Who the hell are they?

24:41.605 --> 24:44.065
Sergeant Jang killed Taeho
and those are his men.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.946
Where's the party?

24:51.823 --> 24:53.116
Heesung, you bastard!

24:53.909 --> 24:55.035
Hando.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.551
Fuck.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.554
Get Gicheul.

25:15.013 --> 25:16.431
Destroy them!

25:19.309 --> 25:21.686

26:40.640 --> 26:43.268

26:43.351 --> 26:44.853
Come on.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.912
MAN: Good evening.

27:10.211 --> 27:12.380
Fucking hell.

27:13.632 --> 27:14.966
Kill them all!

-I'll fucking...
-Hey.

28:25.870 --> 28:26.871
(GLASS BREAKING)

28:54.149 --> 28:55.275
You choose.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.153
Do you want to die here?

29:06.411 --> 29:08.246
(GROANS)

29:12.667 --> 29:14.335
Or stay out of my sight forever?

29:26.848 --> 29:28.057
Wrap it up.

29:30.685 --> 29:32.103
I'm tired. Let's wrap it up.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.065
Let go of me!

29:36.149 --> 29:37.901
Get off me, you bastards!

29:37.984 --> 29:39.986
Get off me!

29:40.069 --> 29:42.197
I said get off me, you fucking bastards!

29:42.280 --> 29:43.281
Get off me!

You fucker.

Hey, friend.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.912
Fuck off, you bastard.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.208
Did you get hit a lot?

30:35.291 --> 30:37.335
Gangnam is our home, you know.

30:38.169 --> 30:39.629
So stay out.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.215
Sorry, man.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.425
You bastard.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.427
-We have to go, Hando.
-You bastard!

30:46.511 --> 30:49.806
Stay out of our turf, you country fucks!

It's already drying up.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.395

-Good job.

30:57.730 --> 30:58.940
-Let's work.
-Yes, sir.

31:00.316 --> 31:02.026
You were right.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.903
They all took the bait.

31:05.488 --> 31:06.489
Thanks.

-Hando...
-JUNMO: Out of fucking curiosity,

31:10.827 --> 31:13.621
why did you call me here?

31:14.289 --> 31:15.748
To make me do some fighting?

31:17.125 --> 31:19.002
Why don't you talk to him directly?

31:20.879 --> 31:22.171
Yes, boss.

31:23.214 --> 31:24.632
This is Jung Gicheul.

31:24.757 --> 31:27.677
How fucking annoying.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.097
I heard you allowed Sergeant Jang's boys

31:31.180 --> 31:32.348
to blindside me.

31:33.725 --> 31:38.605
(SMIRKS) After all the money
I've sent you,

31:39.397 --> 31:41.482
this is just wrong, isn't it?

31:42.775 --> 31:44.652
I won't send any more money now.

31:47.113 --> 31:48.698
Take care.

31:49.407 --> 31:50.450
(PHONE BEEPS)

32:01.044 --> 32:04.923
Find Jung Gicheul in Seoul,

32:06.591 --> 32:10.803
cut his stomach open,
and throw him into the waters of Incheon.

32:11.512 --> 32:13.056
No, wait.

32:13.806 --> 32:19.479
Bring him here, cut his stomach open,
and throw him into the waters of Busan.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.694
In any case,

32:27.737 --> 32:29.739
shouldn't you make a call

32:29.822 --> 32:31.282
to Boss Kanemoto?

MAN: You must have done some good acting.

32:42.126 --> 32:44.253
Busan bastards... Hey.

32:49.926 --> 32:54.180
I wanted to get rid
of the useless leeches in the gang,

32:54.263 --> 32:55.264
so I put on a ruse.

32:57.141 --> 32:59.018
Here, everything needs a good reason.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.606
So what?

33:04.524 --> 33:07.068
What does it have to do with me?

33:08.361 --> 33:09.737
What about Sergeant Jang?

33:11.531 --> 33:13.533
Sir, everything's finished.

33:16.285 --> 33:17.328
Shall we go outside?

33:29.841 --> 33:30.842
Yes, sir.

33:30.925 --> 33:32.176
Hey, the lights.

33:39.308 --> 33:41.436
Taeho wanted to open a business here.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.982
I should've done this sooner.
But I guess it's too late.

33:48.192 --> 33:49.235
Taeho...

33:51.446 --> 33:53.448
was like a brother to me.

34:02.248 --> 34:05.835
I want you to make his dream come true.

34:14.886 --> 34:15.928
I killed him.

34:18.848 --> 34:21.392
That son of a bitch
Sergeant Jang killed Taeho,

34:22.351 --> 34:23.936
and I tore him into pieces.

34:30.401 --> 34:33.529
I'm Kwon Seungho. Nice to meet you.

against him, it's settled now.

He's our newest member,
so treat him well. Got it?

35:07.313 --> 35:08.439
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.484
Okay?

35:11.567 --> 35:12.693
ALL: Yes, sir!

35:14.237 --> 35:15.988
-Let's give him a hand.
-Hey.

35:56.946 --> 35:58.197
Only these two are ours.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.657
You can't go beyond.

35:59.740 --> 36:01.450
Each area has its owner.

36:01.534 --> 36:05.246
The job of the newest members
is to patrol our area

36:05.329 --> 36:07.456
from 5:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. the next day.

36:07.540 --> 36:10.042
You're like patrol officers.

36:10.126 --> 36:13.880
Check if there's an accident
or if someone's causing a ruckus.

36:13.963 --> 36:17.758
If you spot guys from other gangs, we need
to report it right away. That's it.

Got it?

36:19.886 --> 36:21.470
MAN: Left from there.

36:26.851 --> 36:32.690
By the way,
why do you use honorifics with me?

36:33.399 --> 36:36.569
Hey, whoever fights well
deserves my respect.

36:36.652 --> 36:39.530
I mean, I saw you fight,

36:39.614 --> 36:44.619
and even Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee
would be no match for you.

36:44.702 --> 36:47.622
You were amazing.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.876
By the way, to fight well,

36:52.001 --> 36:53.586
should I learn Taekwondo?

36:54.921 --> 36:57.590
-What's your problem?
-Who the fuck are you?

36:57.673 --> 36:59.425
Hey, hit me if you dare.

36:59.508 --> 37:01.886
You motherfucker!

Yongdae, keep up the good work.

37:50.643 --> 37:53.145
Once a new guy joins, we'll be free.

37:54.146 --> 37:55.273
When will that happen?

37:55.356 --> 37:58.234

God damn it.

are just driving skills?

(SIGHS) Who knows.

38:30.558 --> 38:33.894
I'm going to get some shut-eye.
Wake me up in a bit.

38:33.978 --> 38:37.148
I need to go on fucking patrol again.

38:39.066 --> 38:43.029
YONGDAE: Most gangsters take money
for so-called protection.

38:43.112 --> 38:45.698
But each of our members runs a store

38:45.781 --> 38:48.409
and pays half of the profits
to our company.

other than food and drinks?

or other businesses...

and I'm the second newest.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.427
So what would I know?

39:06.552 --> 39:09.013
All I know is which club
has the hotter girls.

39:09.096 --> 39:10.973

39:11.057 --> 39:12.933
SECURITY DIVISION

39:41.670 --> 39:42.713
Mr. Cha Bongju.

39:43.464 --> 39:47.593
You'll face three to five years in prison
for violating the National Security Act.

39:47.676 --> 39:49.345
You'll be kicked out of college

39:49.428 --> 39:52.807
and have a criminal record
while your friends find jobs.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.183
I know nothing.

39:57.061 --> 40:00.022
I heard you say earlier
that you're from Jeonju.

40:02.024 --> 40:04.360
Me too. I went to
Jeonju Girls' High School.

40:06.904 --> 40:08.280
Here.

40:08.364 --> 40:09.532
Have one.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.618
It's the least I can do
for a hometown friend.

40:20.668 --> 40:23.003
I usually don't say
things like this, but...

40:29.093 --> 40:31.554
You know we're questioning
your friends as well.

40:33.180 --> 40:37.309
Everyone says you're the leader, Bongju.

40:38.727 --> 40:40.146
But that's not true, right?

40:43.023 --> 40:44.900
(YONGDAE LAUGHING)

40:47.445 --> 40:49.238
Can't you sleep at your own house?

40:49.321 --> 40:53.576
Right. My parents moved to Ilsan, so...

40:53.659 --> 40:55.870
Gosh, I really need to move out.

40:56.203 --> 40:57.580
Then, please go wash up.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.457
I did this morning.

41:00.416 --> 41:02.084
That was yesterday morning.

41:02.168 --> 41:04.837
Who cares? It's still a morning.

41:05.921 --> 41:08.090
Gosh, I'm hungry.

41:30.738 --> 41:32.490
Hi, Youngpil.
It's me, Yu Euijeong.

41:32.573 --> 41:33.824
Junmo's...

41:33.908 --> 41:36.660
Hello, Euijeong.

41:36.744 --> 41:37.828
How have you been?

41:37.912 --> 41:39.288
I've been great, thanks.

41:39.747 --> 41:42.500
I haven't heard from Junmo
since yesterday,

41:42.583 --> 41:43.959
so I was just worried.

41:45.377 --> 41:46.670
YOUNGPIL: What?

41:46.754 --> 41:47.922
What is it?

41:49.381 --> 41:52.468
He's on sick leave because of his asthma.

-(GRUNTS SOFTLY)
-Hey.

42:23.916 --> 42:27.086
I got an urgent call from a friend.
Can I go grab a quick lunch?

42:32.299 --> 42:33.384
Only if it's a woman.

42:34.301 --> 42:35.302
It's a woman.

42:35.636 --> 42:37.555
Okay. Who is it?

42:39.098 --> 42:40.432
How about a double date?

42:42.893 --> 42:44.478
Handsome guys get it all.

42:44.562 --> 42:45.896
I don't need noodles...

42:46.855 --> 42:50.317
Right. Eating food
with a woman tastes better.

42:51.235 --> 42:53.988
And I'm eating cup noodles alone.
But it's all right.

43:01.203 --> 43:03.455
Euijeong, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you sooner.

43:16.844 --> 43:18.220
Now tell me.

43:19.388 --> 43:20.889
What are you up to these days?

43:23.058 --> 43:25.436
Who's buying you suits
behind your wife's back?

43:25.519 --> 43:26.687
It's not like that.

43:31.358 --> 43:36.739
To tell you the truth,
in order to catch drug traffickers,

43:36.822 --> 43:38.824
I've gone undercover in a gang.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

43:44.288 --> 43:46.749
Seriously, that's what they said.

Hello, sir.

GICHEUL: Hey, Seungho.

43:55.883 --> 43:57.426
-JUNMO: Yes, sir?
-What are you doing?

44:02.556 --> 44:04.808
I was just meeting with someone.

44:05.351 --> 44:08.479
Wait, I know her from high school.

44:09.396 --> 44:10.898
Funny to see you all here.

44:10.981 --> 44:12.274
Long time no see.

44:14.318 --> 44:15.319
It's been a while.

44:16.695 --> 44:18.906
She's my friend from elementary school.

44:18.989 --> 44:20.741
We were in the same Taekwondo club.

44:22.493 --> 44:23.702
And this is

44:24.328 --> 44:26.955
the president of the company
I recently joined.

44:28.791 --> 44:30.042
Oh, really?

44:30.459 --> 44:33.671
Gicheul was a grade younger than me
at church back in high school.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.092
How have you been?

44:38.759 --> 44:40.636
Good, thanks.

44:41.887 --> 44:43.097
How is it being a cop?

44:43.180 --> 44:44.807
So you've heard?

44:46.975 --> 44:48.519
GICHEUL: What's your department?

44:49.561 --> 44:51.146
Security Division at SMPA.

44:54.525 --> 44:56.110
Are you finished eating?

44:56.193 --> 44:57.194
Yeah.

44:58.487 --> 45:00.114
Can I take Seungho with me?

45:09.456 --> 45:12.793
I'll get going now. I'll call you later.

45:19.800 --> 45:22.219
How dare you meet a cop, you prick?

45:22.302 --> 45:23.429
It's not like that.

45:23.512 --> 45:25.806
We've been close since elementary school.

45:26.348 --> 45:28.308
My dad was a junkie,

45:28.392 --> 45:30.269
and whenever he got high and beat me,

45:30.352 --> 45:33.063
I used to escape to her place.

45:33.147 --> 45:35.691
Why did you contact her, you bastard?

45:36.191 --> 45:37.276
Damn it!

45:37.359 --> 45:39.403
I didn't contact her.

45:40.696 --> 45:42.656
She contacted me first.

45:44.366 --> 45:47.161
Why did that fucking cop contact you?

45:47.244 --> 45:49.121
My dad got in trouble for taking drugs,

45:51.206 --> 45:53.167
and he's being held at SMPA.

45:57.045 --> 45:58.213
JUNMO: Boss.

46:00.257 --> 46:02.009
I seriously couldn't believe it

46:02.092 --> 46:04.261
when I heard you're close with Euijeong.

46:04.344 --> 46:06.430
But is that my fault?

46:10.392 --> 46:11.560
Let's go.

46:11.685 --> 46:13.145
-Seungho.
-Yes, sir.

46:20.986 --> 46:23.322
Show respect to Boss, you son of a bitch.

46:25.657 --> 46:26.825
I'm sorry.

46:42.925 --> 46:44.676
It's me, Euijeong.

46:44.802 --> 46:47.763
You are involved in Junmo's
meth investigation, aren't you?

46:53.060 --> 46:55.813
You think I'll believe
what you say, Seungho?

46:55.896 --> 46:56.897
Hey.

46:58.232 --> 47:00.567
I'm allergic to cops, you know.

47:00.651 --> 47:02.277
Come on. Enough.

47:10.327 --> 47:11.662
Try to understand.

47:12.621 --> 47:14.540
Taeho's cousin suddenly shows up,

47:14.873 --> 47:17.793
and he happened to be the neighbor

47:17.876 --> 47:19.962
of Boss' church friend from high school.

47:20.587 --> 47:22.589
Even to you, doesn't it sound weird?

47:25.342 --> 47:28.762
It's such a small world
in Korea, isn't it?

47:31.431 --> 47:36.562
Gicheul, did she like tteokbokki
from the same shop as you?

47:40.274 --> 47:41.692
I bet she did.

47:41.775 --> 47:44.695
She was his first love,
and they did everything together.

48:16.560 --> 48:18.437
EUIJEONG: It's from my church
back in high school.

48:19.021 --> 48:20.606
I should take that home.
