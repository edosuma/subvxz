WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.264
ROLAND:
Admit it.

00:03.438 --> 00:05.875
You like having me here.

00:06.049 --> 00:07.964
I mean, you didn't
think you would.

00:08.138 --> 00:11.489
But then, gradually,
you realized

00:11.663 --> 00:14.101
that Blum is like
a shot in the arm.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.625
And, let me just also say,

00:16.799 --> 00:18.714
I did not walk into your office

00:18.888 --> 00:20.933
with lofty expectations.

00:21.108 --> 00:23.806
But since I've been here,
I've... been impressed.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.329
Everybody I've met here

00:25.503 --> 00:26.939
is competent,

00:27.114 --> 00:28.376
clean,

00:28.550 --> 00:29.986
and articulate.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.335
So, kudos.

00:31.509 --> 00:32.945
But I've
also noticed

00:33.120 --> 00:35.165
what you lack.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.689
And that--
if I may be so crass--

00:37.863 --> 00:39.691
is balls.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.302
Balls?

00:41.476 --> 00:43.304
Yes. Balls.

00:43.478 --> 00:45.132
And that's why I'm crashing
your little...

00:45.306 --> 00:46.785
end-of-year meeting here.

00:46.959 --> 00:50.137
You are all good at
working within the rules.

00:50.311 --> 00:51.921
But there's a reason
why rules don't benefit

00:52.095 --> 00:53.879
people like you and me.

00:54.054 --> 00:57.187
We're not part
of the establishment.

00:57.361 --> 01:00.582
There's a lot of hate
out there towards you.

01:00.756 --> 01:03.019
So why be nice
to them? I believe

01:03.193 --> 01:05.413
it was Dr. King
who said,

01:05.587 --> 01:09.069
"Hatred is gained
as much by good works

01:09.243 --> 01:10.766
as by evil."

01:10.940 --> 01:12.985
And that
is why you need

01:13.160 --> 01:14.944
someone out there with, uh,

01:15.118 --> 01:17.729
the hairy chesters to fight.

01:17.903 --> 01:19.557
Well, I'm ready

01:19.731 --> 01:21.342
and I'm willing.
So,

01:21.516 --> 01:23.257
what exactly...

01:23.431 --> 01:25.607
is it that you're proposing?

01:25.781 --> 01:27.913
I've decided to join the firm.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.393
[laughs]

01:29.567 --> 01:31.265
Well, not as a name partner,
of course.

01:31.439 --> 01:32.614
Not at first.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.137
But I think it's obvious

01:34.311 --> 01:36.400
that we got something good
going on here.

01:36.574 --> 01:38.402
Wow, Roland.
You've given us...

01:38.576 --> 01:40.143
a lot to chew on.

01:40.317 --> 01:42.450
Yeah, I'd like an answer now.
Well, I'm sorry.

01:42.624 --> 01:43.668
We have to follow protocol.

01:43.842 --> 01:45.366
You understand.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.977
Just give us some
time to confer.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.587
Sure.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.155
Enjoy your meat.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.809
Thank you.
[chuckles]

01:53.983 --> 01:55.941
[indistinct chatter]

01:56.116 --> 01:58.292
Miss me?

01:58.466 --> 02:00.946
LIZ:
That man is crazy.

02:01.121 --> 02:05.037
And when did Dr. King say
a-anything remotely like that?

02:05.212 --> 02:06.952
It's Machiavelli.
Yeah. Yeah.
Of course it is.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.172
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
that man is a cancer

02:09.346 --> 02:11.566
and we got to get him
out of here immediately.
Obviously,

02:11.740 --> 02:13.394
the sun would have
to burn up

02:13.568 --> 02:16.179
before we make Roland Blum
a partner. But...

02:16.353 --> 02:18.399
Uh-uh. There is no "but."
Mm-mmm.
But...

02:18.573 --> 02:21.010
if we tell him now,
he goes ballistic.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.577
Let's just let him
finish his work

02:22.751 --> 02:24.448
on Second Helix
while we figure out

02:24.622 --> 02:25.797
the exit strategies.

02:25.971 --> 02:27.103
So we string him along?
Till we find

02:27.277 --> 02:28.757
a way to just...

02:28.931 --> 02:30.454
ease his ass out the door.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.804
BARRY:We need to get
his work accelerated

02:32.978 --> 02:34.850
on Second Helix.
This is crazy.

02:35.024 --> 02:36.852
I'll take care of it.

02:37.026 --> 02:39.071
♪ ...by shark, doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo, baby shark ♪

02:39.246 --> 02:41.335

02:41.509 --> 02:44.207
Uh, Francesca,
I will call you back, okay?

02:44.381 --> 02:46.644
Bye. Hi, Diane.

02:46.818 --> 02:49.299
Everything all right?
Uh, yes.

02:49.473 --> 02:52.084
Uh, listen, uh, you're on hold
with the Sweeney divorce.

02:52.259 --> 02:53.085
Yes.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.522
Just for a week.

02:54.696 --> 02:56.263
Continuance. Why?

02:56.437 --> 02:58.656
So, um...

02:58.830 --> 03:00.223
you know your neighbor
[Roland shouting indistinctly]

03:00.397 --> 03:02.225
across the hall?
When I say the 18th,

03:02.399 --> 03:04.053
I mean the 18th!

03:04.227 --> 03:06.882
Where Roland Blum...
Mm-hmm.

03:07.056 --> 03:09.101
Listen, the partners
need your help.

03:09.276 --> 03:12.757
We need you to supervise
the Second Helix discovery.

03:12.931 --> 03:15.107
Supervise? In what way?

03:15.282 --> 03:17.545
Blum is stalling. He's
been here for three weeks,

03:17.719 --> 03:20.461
and he's put in about
two hours' worth of work.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.680
We need someone who
can get the job done.

03:22.854 --> 03:26.684
So...
LUCCA: Let's just get some
second years and paralegals.

03:26.858 --> 03:28.599
Oh, we had four
associates on it.

03:28.773 --> 03:30.601
He sent them out
on errands.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.647
[sighs]
Blum is seductive.

03:32.821 --> 03:35.476
He... We-we need an
adult in the room.
JULIUS: What?

03:35.650 --> 03:37.652
What do you mean, what?
My presentation.

03:37.826 --> 03:40.002
Oh. Oh. Good. Good.

03:40.176 --> 03:43.005
We, um, just need
to deliberate.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.269
Come on, Julius.

03:46.443 --> 03:48.880
I was there for you
with the judgeship.

03:49.054 --> 03:50.621
Be there for me.
[clears throat]

03:50.795 --> 03:52.623
Uh, we need to take a vote.

03:52.797 --> 03:55.060
Bringing in a
new partner is a...

03:55.235 --> 03:56.758
It's not a simple matter.

03:56.932 --> 03:57.759
[sniffs]

03:57.933 --> 03:59.543
So, who's for me

03:59.717 --> 04:01.241
and who's against me?

04:01.415 --> 04:04.766
Uh, I'm not sure that's clear.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.464
Okay. Good.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.553
Thanks.

04:11.294 --> 04:13.775
I work all day with liars,
big and small.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.603
It's good practice.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.605
He's lying.

04:17.779 --> 04:20.129
Are you talking to me?

04:21.086 --> 04:22.523
Liz, one second.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.438
[quietly]:
Come here.

04:24.612 --> 04:25.961
Oh.

04:26.135 --> 04:28.616
Diane, you two should
really hear this walk-in.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.357
What is it?

04:30.531 --> 04:34.099
It's a class action about
the 2016 presidential election.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.971
That lady voted for Hillary.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.364
The voting machine registered

04:37.538 --> 04:39.453
her vote for Trump.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.716
On a paperless voting machine?
Yeah.

04:41.890 --> 04:44.196
But...
there's evidence.
MONA: Okay, so...

04:44.371 --> 04:46.808
What's the evidence?
This is to document
what just happened.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.810
I voted
an all-Democratic ticket.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.768
Gives me the option,
as you see here.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.117
So I did.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.989
And then I scrolled down,

04:54.163 --> 04:55.991
and the machine mixed up
my votes.

04:56.165 --> 04:57.906
Some Democrat, some Republican.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.299
And then, at the bottom,

04:59.473 --> 05:01.692
it's got me voting for Trump.

05:01.866 --> 05:04.652
Wow.
This is a voting machine
without a paper ballot,

05:04.826 --> 05:06.697
so there's no record.

05:06.871 --> 05:08.046
And the poll watcher
just told me

05:08.220 --> 05:09.613
there's nothing
I can do about this.

05:09.787 --> 05:10.919
Apparently, there are
other voters who reported

05:11.093 --> 05:12.007
the same problem.

05:12.181 --> 05:13.313
So she's suing the state?

05:13.487 --> 05:15.489
No. She's suing
Kohl-Flores,

05:15.663 --> 05:18.274
the manufacturer
of the voting machine.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.189
Oh, so for faulty design.
Right.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.931
Product liability.
Not a bad way to go.

05:23.105 --> 05:26.326
Apparently, the same machines
are being used in 2020.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.153
[snaps fingers]
Come on.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.505
Mona, these are the
partners I told you about.

05:31.679 --> 05:33.202
Ms. Reddick,
Diane Lockhart.

05:33.376 --> 05:34.812
And this is
Mona's friend...

05:34.986 --> 05:36.205
Rachelle Max.

05:36.379 --> 05:37.859
Nice to meet you.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.035
I've heard great things
about you two.

05:40.209 --> 05:43.560
I told Mona one of the reasons I
wanted her to move her case here

05:43.734 --> 05:45.432
is that I've heard
such great things

05:45.606 --> 05:47.216
about the activism
here.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.174
ADRIAN:Ms. Max works as a
pollster at, uh...

05:49.349 --> 05:52.134
DLE Strategies. Mona was unhappy
with her first legal team.

05:52.308 --> 05:54.179
Weren't you?
Yes.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.225
They didn't seem
to take it seriously.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.793
How far along
is your case?
We have a hearing

05:58.967 --> 06:00.534
this afternoon
on discovery.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.319
Liz, do you
have a minute?

06:03.493 --> 06:04.364
Yeah.

06:04.538 --> 06:05.756
If you have
any questions,

06:05.930 --> 06:07.323
I can answer them.

06:07.497 --> 06:09.717
Uh, no, I think we'd
like to discuss this.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.808
We'll be right back.

06:13.982 --> 06:15.766
[mouths]

06:15.940 --> 06:17.855
[door closes]

06:21.903 --> 06:23.600
I know this is a rush,
but this is a good case

06:23.774 --> 06:25.907
with a really smart
legal strategy.

06:26.081 --> 06:28.866
This company is sending
malfunctioning voting machines

06:29.040 --> 06:30.651
into the black community.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.479
Seems like something
you would jump at.

06:32.653 --> 06:33.958
Okay. I-I just need
a minute.

06:34.132 --> 06:35.786
Yeah. Me, too.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.442
What...

06:39.616 --> 06:41.052
LIZ [quietly]:
What the fuck?
What the fuck what?

06:41.226 --> 06:42.967
I'm bringing you a good case.

06:43.141 --> 06:45.579
These crappy voting machines go
to African-American districts

06:45.753 --> 06:47.015
and miscount the votes.

06:47.189 --> 06:48.930
Mona needs
the best possible lawyers.

06:49.104 --> 06:51.323
That's you.
Then come to us first.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.108
Don't just surprise us.

06:53.282 --> 06:55.502
Wait a minute.
Fight Club rules.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.721
We do not talk
about Book Club.

06:57.895 --> 07:00.463
Yeah, well, this is
complicated for us.
No. Wait.

07:00.637 --> 07:02.334
If you don't want the case,
say no.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.641
But this case could be good for
the resistance and your firm.

07:04.815 --> 07:06.556
So I really don't understand
the problem.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.689
My problem is not knowing
whether I am representing

07:08.863 --> 07:10.255
the client or
the Book Club.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.779
The client.

07:11.953 --> 07:12.954
But this case
could stop the other side

07:13.128 --> 07:14.651
from corrupting the vote
in 2020.

07:14.825 --> 07:16.348
So that's good.

07:16.523 --> 07:20.918
And you're letting your hurt
feelings get in the way.

07:24.922 --> 07:27.142
[grunts, exhales]

07:28.970 --> 07:30.450
Hello.

07:33.583 --> 07:34.932
[scoffs]

07:35.106 --> 07:36.064
You, uh...

07:36.238 --> 07:38.762
you supposed
to be in here?

07:38.936 --> 07:41.461
This isn't even evidence.

07:41.635 --> 07:43.637
These are legal invoices
sent over

07:43.811 --> 07:45.987
by the opposing firm
to distract us.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.815
Well, we still got
to go through it.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.034
Uh, no, we don't.
Because...

07:50.208 --> 07:52.167
I just did.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.518
This is ourevidence.

07:55.692 --> 07:57.302
This is the case

07:57.477 --> 07:59.130
that we won
against Second Helix,

07:59.304 --> 08:01.045
so we don't need to review it.

08:01.219 --> 08:02.046
But you don't know that.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.483
They might have, uh,

08:03.657 --> 08:05.310
mingled other evidence in there
with it.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.529
No one does that.

08:06.703 --> 08:07.965
[whispers]:
I do that.

08:08.139 --> 08:09.097
Okay, Mr. Blum,

08:09.271 --> 08:10.359
so, here's the thing.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.274
You're wanting to delay this.

08:12.448 --> 08:14.581
I was put on this case
to hurry it.

08:14.755 --> 08:15.582
And who's more likely
to make mistakes,

08:15.756 --> 08:16.626
the person who hurries it

08:16.800 --> 08:18.193
or the person who doesn't?

08:18.367 --> 08:19.368
We're not feet-dragging here.

08:19.542 --> 08:20.848
Not anymore.
And that is why

08:21.022 --> 08:23.415
I brought my, uh...
my associate along.

08:25.766 --> 08:27.637
Hello.
Yeah, this is

08:27.811 --> 08:30.684
the associate part of
Roland Blum &amp; Associates.

08:30.858 --> 08:32.816
Gary Carr.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.339
Lucca Quinn.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.732
Oh, so he gets your
name and I don't?

08:35.906 --> 08:37.299
That's reverse racism.

08:37.473 --> 08:39.214
As I was just telling
Mr. Blum,

08:39.388 --> 08:41.477
uh, we need to move faster.

08:41.651 --> 08:43.131
Gary's been saying that
the whole time.

08:43.305 --> 08:45.307
Haven't you,
Gary?
I, uh...

08:45.481 --> 08:47.352
Actually, I just thought
I was here to observe.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.484
Oh, you were.

08:48.658 --> 08:50.530
But now it's all hands on deck.

08:50.704 --> 08:53.315
We just got scolded
for not working fast enough.

08:53.489 --> 08:54.708
Well, not scolded.
I just...

08:54.882 --> 08:56.623
I thought we could
more carefully divide up

08:56.797 --> 08:57.667
the workload.

08:57.841 --> 08:58.668
Sounds good.

08:58.842 --> 08:59.669
Gary's smart.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.149
Oh. A prodigy.

09:01.323 --> 09:02.759
Harvard Law
Reviewat 23.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.239
Please, Mr. Blum...

09:04.413 --> 09:05.980
Stop with the humility.
You're too nice a guy.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.503
What do I always say?

09:07.677 --> 09:09.244
Kindness is hypocrisy.

09:09.418 --> 09:10.506
Yeah, he was shortlisted

09:10.680 --> 09:12.552
for Kagan's
law clerk,

09:12.726 --> 09:14.771
but he wanted to give
back to the community.
[clears throat]

09:14.945 --> 09:16.947
So he became
a community organizer

09:17.121 --> 09:18.906
in Baltimore.

09:19.080 --> 09:19.907
[chuckles]
Wow.

09:20.081 --> 09:21.952
Nice to meet you.

09:22.126 --> 09:26.348
So, I think the best thing here
is to find the real cases,

09:26.522 --> 09:28.219
because a lot of this
is depo dump filler.

09:28.393 --> 09:29.699
Whatever I
can do to help.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.483
Hmm.
Gary wanted to know
what it's like

09:31.658 --> 09:33.834
to work
in a-an African-American firm.
[phone ringing]

09:34.008 --> 09:35.923
He's only ever worked
in white firms.

09:36.097 --> 09:36.924
Yeah.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.142
What is it?

09:38.316 --> 09:40.405
I told you,
an hour late.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.494
Shut up. Shut up!

09:42.669 --> 09:44.105
I'm fucking coming!

09:44.279 --> 09:45.976
Geez.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.413
[sighs]
It's my 2:00 hummer.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.632
I'll be back.

09:49.806 --> 09:52.809
Now, you two-- behave.

09:54.855 --> 09:56.552
He's not drinking it.
You want it?

09:56.726 --> 09:58.772
Is it tequila?
[chuckles]

09:58.946 --> 10:00.600
No, but I can
find some.

10:00.774 --> 10:03.646
No, I'm-I'm fine.
Maybe later.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.605
Let's divide these up
into circuits.

10:05.779 --> 10:08.042
How long have you worked
with Blum?

10:08.216 --> 10:09.826
A week.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.219
Okay, I hope
you're not offended...

10:11.393 --> 10:13.264
I hope I am.

10:13.438 --> 10:14.962
You just don't seem
like the Blum type.

10:15.136 --> 10:17.660
How did you two
get connected?

10:17.834 --> 10:20.228
I wanted to see what
corporate law was like.

10:20.402 --> 10:23.231
[chuckles]
Well, Blum is not...

10:23.405 --> 10:26.190
the best example
of corporate law.

10:26.364 --> 10:29.237
Are you?

10:34.372 --> 10:35.765
[chuckles]

10:35.939 --> 10:37.549
Oh, no, that's-that's...
that's circuit.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.726
Oh.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.734
Your Honor,
this is a nuisance claim.

10:47.908 --> 10:49.736
There was a free
and fair election.

10:49.910 --> 10:52.347
No, there should be
a free and fair election.

10:52.521 --> 10:53.914
Can I finish, Your Honor?

10:54.088 --> 10:55.655
Yeah, let's just all
let each other finish.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.047
The plaintiff,

10:57.221 --> 10:58.788
or, more likely,
the plaintiff's attorneys

10:58.962 --> 11:01.138
as part of
a Democratic party strategy,

11:01.312 --> 11:02.879
are in here seeking
to have it undercut.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.533
With all due
respect, Your Honor,

11:04.707 --> 11:06.317
a black woman's
right to vote

11:06.491 --> 11:09.756
being characterized as
a nuisance is offensive.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.367
Especially given the blood
that was shed to secure it.

11:12.541 --> 11:13.542
You know,
that's one race card showing.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.370
You looking for a pair?
Oh.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.024
ENO:
Oh, my God. There's
no cameras here.

11:17.198 --> 11:18.765
No one's gonna read
a transcript. Okay?

11:18.939 --> 11:22.420
It's just us. So let's just
all of us talk, okay?

11:22.594 --> 11:23.683
ADRIAN:
We agree, Your Honor.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.554
But to talk, we need
discovery first.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.382
We just want a full accounting

11:27.556 --> 11:29.166
of which voting machines

11:29.340 --> 11:31.560
were designated
to which precincts,

11:31.734 --> 11:33.518
how many of those voting
machines malfunctioned,

11:33.693 --> 11:35.738
who that helped,

11:35.912 --> 11:38.523
and who that hurt.
SUKONICK: I'm not sure
that data even exists.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.830
LIZ:
Uh, Your Honor, we
are perfectly willing

11:41.004 --> 11:42.789
to work with raw data

11:42.963 --> 11:45.530
and make whatever statistical
analysis irrelevant ourselves.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.750
ENO:
Right, that's not an
unreasonable request,

11:47.924 --> 11:49.230
Ms. Sukonick.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.014
Um, your client is,

11:51.188 --> 11:52.799
uh, directed to provide
said information forthwith.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.844
SUKONICK:
Your Honor, the people
have made their will clear

11:55.018 --> 11:57.107
at the ballot box.
Uh, we will also need
the software architecture

11:57.281 --> 11:58.805
of these voting machines,
Your Honor,

11:58.979 --> 12:01.329
in order to know how the
malfunction transpired.

12:01.503 --> 12:02.983
ENO:
I'm guessing

12:03.157 --> 12:05.550
you have an objection,
Counselor, or your client does?

12:05.725 --> 12:06.900
Yes, Your Honor.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.423
That software
is proprietary information

12:08.597 --> 12:10.381
and is therefore protected.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.122
Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.689
Okay. So, here's what

12:13.863 --> 12:15.212
we're gonna do.
Let's take the next 24 hours

12:15.386 --> 12:16.997
to read up on Ruckelshaus,

12:17.171 --> 12:20.174
and I'll hear arguments
here tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

12:20.348 --> 12:22.132
And then I will decide
whether the software

12:22.306 --> 12:24.961
is subject to discovery. Good?

12:25.135 --> 12:27.094
Hey. What was that about?

12:27.268 --> 12:29.139
What do you mean?
The software.

12:29.313 --> 12:30.662
Why do you need it?

12:30.837 --> 12:32.795
[whispers]:
Not here.

12:33.970 --> 12:36.364
[phone buzzes]

12:36.538 --> 12:38.235
Hello?

12:38.409 --> 12:39.671
Blum is stalling.

12:39.846 --> 12:40.890
He's not even looking
at the depos.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.500
He's just shoving around paper.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.111
Okay, thanks.

12:44.285 --> 12:45.808
Yeah, but he has
an associate working with him.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.854
Carr. He seems
to be doing good work.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.638
He's smart. You know, he's...

12:49.812 --> 12:51.031
I think
he's taking it seriously.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.119
Blum has an associate?

12:52.293 --> 12:53.468
I know.

12:53.642 --> 12:54.948
And he's the total opposite
of him.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.471
We've gotten through

12:56.645 --> 12:58.125
four boxes in two hours.
DIANE:
Okay.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.083
Do you mind
spending another day on this?

13:00.257 --> 13:01.345
No, I don't mind.

13:01.519 --> 13:02.477
Good. Thanks.

13:02.651 --> 13:03.783
Yeah.

13:07.351 --> 13:09.310
[clears throat]

13:12.313 --> 13:14.271
[Louisa laughs]

13:14.445 --> 13:16.012
He didn't do
his own singing, did he?

13:16.186 --> 13:18.928
No, I think he did. I don't
think they dubbed him.

13:19.102 --> 13:20.843
LOUISA:Wow, he's got such
a great voice.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.932
GOLDIE:
Yeah, he's pretty amazing.

13:23.106 --> 13:24.934
Everything all right?

13:25.108 --> 13:28.024
Yeah, I'll be right back.

13:30.070 --> 13:32.463
Hey, uh, Louisa? Goldie? Hi.

13:32.637 --> 13:35.379
What were you talking about
just then? The singing?

13:35.553 --> 13:36.511
[both chuckle]

13:36.685 --> 13:38.252
Uh, on Downton Abbey.

13:38.426 --> 13:40.080
We were just wondering
if that was his own singing.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.690
Downton Abbey,the TV show?

13:41.864 --> 13:42.822
Mm-hmm.Yeah.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.345
Who are you talking about?

13:44.519 --> 13:45.737
Gary Carr.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.131
I don't...
He was on Downton Abbey?

13:48.305 --> 13:50.264
Yeah, the fourth season.
Don't you remember?

13:50.438 --> 13:52.396
I never watched it.
Can you get me an autograph?

13:52.570 --> 13:54.224
He's an actor?

13:54.398 --> 13:55.486
Yeah.Yeah.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.488
Then what is...

13:57.662 --> 14:00.709
he doing here?

14:01.841 --> 14:03.364
Hey!

14:03.538 --> 14:05.279
What are you doing?
GARY:
What?

14:05.453 --> 14:07.803
Did Blum hire you
to pretend to be a lawyer?

14:07.977 --> 14:10.893
What?
Did Blum hire you

14:11.067 --> 14:12.895
to pretend to be a lawyer?

14:13.069 --> 14:14.027
No. God, no.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.289
[chuckles]
But you're an actor?

14:17.334 --> 14:19.771
[in British accent]:
Yes. Yes, I'm an actor.

14:19.946 --> 14:22.383
It's research.
I've got a role

14:22.557 --> 14:24.428
in a law show.
My manager knew Blum.

14:24.602 --> 14:26.126
Fixed me up with him
to follow him around.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.736
I-I didn't know he was
gonna actually pass me off

14:27.910 --> 14:29.085
as the real thing.
It's...

14:29.259 --> 14:32.001
[chuckles]
It's-it's funny.

14:32.175 --> 14:34.177
Hmm.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.139
[slides files]

14:39.313 --> 14:41.489
This is not Bring Your Little
British Buddy to Work Day.

14:41.663 --> 14:43.404
[chuckles]

14:43.578 --> 14:45.928
There are millions of dollars of
judgments sitting on this table.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.582
Lucca, I promise
I was gonna tell you

14:47.756 --> 14:49.758
as soon as Blum left,
but the timing was never right,

14:49.932 --> 14:51.803
and we actually got stuck
into some real work.I think

14:51.978 --> 14:54.719
you should wait in reception.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.288
Okay.

14:58.462 --> 15:00.377
And don't take
anything with you.

15:01.465 --> 15:02.640
Is that yours?
Mm-hmm.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.860
Then take it with you.

15:09.473 --> 15:10.561
[stammers quietly]

15:10.735 --> 15:12.650
I'll... just go.

15:12.824 --> 15:14.478

15:14.652 --> 15:16.002
Mr. Carr, uh, can we
take a photo with you?

15:16.176 --> 15:17.960
GARY:
Oh, sure. Yeah, okay.

15:18.134 --> 15:19.831
Actors.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.181
[laughing]
Thank you.

15:21.355 --> 15:22.660
LUCCA:
Hey! Upstairs!

15:22.834 --> 15:25.011
Reception's upstairs!
Sure. Thank you. Right.

15:25.185 --> 15:26.490
LUCCA:
Take direction.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.014
God.

15:29.493 --> 15:30.799
Why don't we wait
until everyone's here?

15:30.973 --> 15:32.279
LIZ:
No, I think
you need to tell us

15:32.453 --> 15:34.716
exactly what's going on
right now.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.065
What did Valerie tell us

15:36.239 --> 15:38.372
on the first day
she brought us together?

15:38.546 --> 15:41.418
Move fast, be smart,
attack, lie, don't get caught.

15:41.592 --> 15:42.724
The new rules.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.900
So, what is the lie here?

15:47.294 --> 15:49.687
We've been working hard
to peel off 70,000 votes

15:49.861 --> 15:51.602
from Trump's base
so he doesn't win in 2020.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.822
Right.
But it's not working.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.780
His approval rating's
gone up two points,

15:55.955 --> 15:58.000
from 40% to 42%.

15:58.174 --> 15:59.610
Trump's base is too strong.

15:59.784 --> 16:00.829
Democrats don't want
to believe it

16:01.003 --> 16:02.222
because they live
in a bubble,

16:02.396 --> 16:04.006
but Trump will
probably win in 2020.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.355
So we try harder.

16:05.529 --> 16:06.966
There's an easier way.
What?

16:07.140 --> 16:09.403
We hack the voting machines.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.102
Excuse me?

16:13.276 --> 16:15.278
We hack the voting machines.

16:15.452 --> 16:17.063
We insert malware into them.

16:17.237 --> 16:20.675
But we need the machine
software in order to do it.

[overlapping chatter]

18:12.308 --> 18:14.354
When we started,
we agreed we would do

18:14.528 --> 18:15.964
what was necessary to win.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.444
Well, this is necessary.

18:17.618 --> 18:21.056
No, convincing the
voters is necessary.

18:21.230 --> 18:24.190
This is stealing an election.
Like Trump?

18:24.364 --> 18:26.714
What, are we gonna
now hold ourselves

18:26.888 --> 18:28.672
to the same
standard as Trump?

18:28.846 --> 18:30.979
If it allows us to win, yes.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.503
This is not winning.
It is stealing.

18:33.677 --> 18:35.070
You keep saying that.

18:35.244 --> 18:37.159
Wait, wait, wait.
We don't have to steal.

18:37.333 --> 18:38.987
We can just offer
a correction.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.336
What does that mean?

18:40.510 --> 18:41.859
Technically, we can
program the malware

18:42.033 --> 18:44.601
to make any adjustment
we want to the vote count.

18:44.775 --> 18:48.039

31:23.664 --> 31:25.622
GARY: Meet me for lunch
so I can apologize.

31:25.796 --> 31:28.147
Uh... you know,
actually, it's fine.

31:28.321 --> 31:30.932
I got your very
expensive apology.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.716
[whispering]: That's the guy
who sent the tequila?

31:32.891 --> 31:35.328
[chuckles]
Look, I really don't like

31:35.502 --> 31:37.634
when there are people out there
who are angry with me.

31:37.808 --> 31:39.071
I'm not angry with you.

31:39.245 --> 31:40.855
Not angry with who?

31:41.029 --> 31:42.335
[whispers]: Shut up, Marissa.
I'm always worried that,

31:42.509 --> 31:44.076
like, if I get hit by a bus

31:44.250 --> 31:45.729
someone will say really
horrible things at my funeral.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.340
I... I won't say

31:47.514 --> 31:48.907
horrible things
at your funeral.

31:49.081 --> 31:51.126
What? Is he dying?
All right, so, um...

31:51.300 --> 31:52.519
I'll confess.

31:52.693 --> 31:54.434
This is a selfish call.

31:54.608 --> 31:55.957
I had a horrible meeting
with my manager,

31:56.131 --> 31:57.393
and I want a palate cleanser

31:57.567 --> 31:58.786
so I can wash it
out of my mouth.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.963
Oh, so now
I'm a palate cleanser?

32:02.137 --> 32:03.791
No. No.
No idea what to do
with that one.

32:03.965 --> 32:06.925
But I... I need someone
who makes me smile.

32:07.099 --> 32:09.057
I promise I won't talk
about being a lawyer.

SUKONICK:
The Fifth Amendment, Your Honor.

32:22.114 --> 32:24.116
That's why
intellectual property

32:24.290 --> 32:26.379
is still property,
and to be forced

32:26.553 --> 32:29.512
to hand over the software
to our competitors...

32:29.686 --> 32:31.036
ADRIAN:
We are not her competitors.

32:31.210 --> 32:33.560
It will end up in the hands
of our competitors.

32:33.734 --> 32:34.953
And that is exactly what

32:35.127 --> 32:36.563
the Constitution
prevents.

32:36.737 --> 32:38.173
Let me take the argument.
Public disclosure

32:38.347 --> 32:40.088
of the software
architecture amounts to
No.

32:40.262 --> 32:42.090
a complete forfeiture of
You don't believe
in it anymore.

32:42.264 --> 32:43.831

I'm a lawyer. I don't have to.

No further comment,
Your Honor.
ENO: Counselors.

32:44.919 --> 32:45.964
Do you have anything?

32:48.227 --> 32:50.620
Um, Your Honor, the issue here
is not intellectual property

32:50.794 --> 32:52.448
and just compensation.

32:52.622 --> 32:55.799
This is a larger issue.
One that speaks

32:55.974 --> 32:57.932
to the heart of our country.

32:58.106 --> 33:00.935
Every vote counts.

33:01.109 --> 33:02.763
And therefore every vote

33:02.937 --> 33:05.461
must becounted.

33:05.635 --> 33:08.638
If the people cannot trust that
their votes will be counted,

33:08.812 --> 33:10.075
how can they
trust the rights

33:10.249 --> 33:12.555
that flow from those
votes? If our votes

33:12.729 --> 33:15.863
are subverted... or discarded

33:16.037 --> 33:18.518
or even ignored,
why have faith

33:18.692 --> 33:20.607
in our democratic
institutions?

33:22.043 --> 33:24.089
Why respect a president--
any president--

33:24.263 --> 33:26.352
even one from our own party?

33:26.526 --> 33:29.137
Why not choose
violent overthrow

33:29.311 --> 33:31.444
if our votes are not counted?

33:31.618 --> 33:33.620
Ms. Sukonick is correct.

33:35.100 --> 33:38.016
This is about
a constitutional right,

33:38.190 --> 33:40.018
but it is not a secondary one,

33:40.192 --> 33:42.411
it is the primary one.

33:42.585 --> 33:44.587
It is about who we are.

33:46.372 --> 33:48.548
That is why we need
this discovery, Your Honor.

33:48.722 --> 33:52.726
This software must be inspected

33:52.900 --> 33:56.208
to see if there is integrity
in the counting of the votes.

33:57.426 --> 33:59.428
That is the issue.

40:52.406 --> 40:53.842
from Democrats to Republicans.

40:54.016 --> 40:55.540
It would be random.

40:55.714 --> 40:57.542
This isn't.
No further questions.

40:57.716 --> 40:59.979
How do you vote, Mr. Dipersia?

41:00.153 --> 41:02.460
Objection.
It goes to bias, Your Honor.

41:02.634 --> 41:04.418
Overruled.

41:04.592 --> 41:06.420
I'll hear.

41:06.594 --> 41:08.814
I'm not eligible to vote.

41:08.988 --> 41:10.337
And that's because you were

41:10.511 --> 41:12.252
an illegal immigrant.
Isn't that right?

41:12.426 --> 41:14.776
I have an O visa. I am a legal
resident of the Unites States.

41:14.950 --> 41:16.865
And you don't think
that you might exaggerate

41:17.039 --> 41:20.303
what's going on here
in order to help the Democrats?

41:20.478 --> 41:23.045
No.
And how often, exactly, would
you say that this malware

41:23.219 --> 41:26.919
that you claim to have detected
actually flipped votes?

41:27.093 --> 41:29.312
Well, it's hard to be exact.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.140
Oh, that is unfortunate.

41:31.314 --> 41:33.229
But in Cullman County, Michigan,
where these machines

41:33.403 --> 41:36.102
were used, Republicans
received eight percent

41:36.276 --> 41:38.104
of African-American votes,
four percent more

41:38.278 --> 41:39.497
than they received
two years earlier.

41:39.671 --> 41:41.194
Isn't there
another reason

41:41.368 --> 41:42.543
for this discrepancy?

41:42.717 --> 41:45.328
Y-You'll have to be more exact.

41:45.503 --> 41:49.376
In 2018, the ballot
in Coleman County was changed

41:49.550 --> 41:51.204
to a butterfly format.
Isn't that

41:51.378 --> 41:55.164
a more likely explanation for
the change in voting patterns

41:55.338 --> 41:58.733
other than a left-wing
conspiracy theory?

42:11.746 --> 42:13.661
LUCCA:
Hey.

42:13.835 --> 42:15.620
You done for the day, Counselor?

42:15.794 --> 42:17.535
Yeah.
It was nice meeting you.

42:17.709 --> 42:19.928
Meeting me? I thought
you were here for a week.

42:20.102 --> 42:23.105
I was. Just... Blum can
be a bit mercurial.

42:23.279 --> 42:24.542
Oh, what happened?

42:24.716 --> 42:26.326
Nothing.
No. Wait. Tell me.

42:28.067 --> 42:29.895
He found out
I gave your investigator

42:30.069 --> 42:31.331
the name of his dietitian.

42:31.505 --> 42:33.202
Ah, fuck. Seriously?

42:33.376 --> 42:34.377
It's okay, though.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.597
My manager has other options.

42:36.771 --> 42:39.426
It was really nice
meeting you, Lucca.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.433
Gary, uh, how many more days

42:46.607 --> 42:48.435
were you wanting to research
being a lawyer?

42:48.609 --> 42:50.219
[elevator bell dings]
Five. Why?

42:50.393 --> 42:52.004
[clears throat] Well, I
have to ask the partners,

42:52.178 --> 42:53.745
but you could follow me.

42:53.919 --> 42:55.529
No way. You serious?
Oh, yeah.

42:55.703 --> 42:57.966
I'd love that.
Yeah, I-I-I...

42:58.140 --> 43:00.142
Thank you.
Oh.

43:01.143 --> 43:03.493
Great.

43:04.973 --> 43:06.061
What...

43:06.932 --> 43:08.498
can I do...

43:11.327 --> 43:13.547
...to relieve the stress,

43:13.721 --> 43:15.636
counselor?

43:22.251 --> 43:23.775
Blum.

43:23.949 --> 43:26.691
You want Blum
to relieve the stress?

43:26.865 --> 43:28.910
[laughs]
[chuckles] Okay.

43:29.084 --> 43:30.477
[mumbles]

43:30.651 --> 43:33.654
I think he secretly
has a crush on you.

43:33.828 --> 43:37.049
[chuckles]

43:37.223 --> 43:40.008
He's coming after us, Charlotte.

43:41.053 --> 43:43.316
I need help going after him.

43:44.317 --> 43:45.666
[scoffs softly]

43:47.320 --> 43:49.017
Sorry.

43:49.191 --> 43:50.758
No.

43:51.803 --> 43:55.633
Why not?[sighs]

43:55.807 --> 43:57.939
Blum...

43:58.113 --> 43:59.724
is a bad man.

43:59.898 --> 44:01.160
[chuckles]

44:01.334 --> 44:04.032
Bad men have...

44:04.206 --> 44:06.034
a force field around them.

44:06.208 --> 44:08.689
You can't give me anything.Mm...

44:08.863 --> 44:11.083
I can give you
a piece of advice.

44:12.432 --> 44:15.609
You go after Blum...
you kill him.

44:17.829 --> 44:20.701
Because anything less,
he won't stop

44:20.875 --> 44:22.660
until he kills you.

44:22.834 --> 44:26.489
You know we're bringing him
in front of the ACDB

44:26.664 --> 44:28.491
for suborning perjury.

44:28.666 --> 44:31.103
Are you serious?
Yep.

44:31.277 --> 44:34.193
Nice knowing you.
[chuckles]

44:34.367 --> 44:37.326
Oh, that's cold.
[chuckles]

44:40.982 --> 44:43.811
I will give you
one thing, though.

44:43.985 --> 44:45.421
About Blum?

44:45.595 --> 44:48.207
Mm, no.

44:48.381 --> 44:49.991
Judge Eno.

44:50.165 --> 44:52.690
She's gonna decide
against you.

44:54.735 --> 44:55.649
What?

44:55.823 --> 44:57.129
Why?

45:00.436 --> 45:03.265
She's on the take.

45:03.439 --> 45:04.745
Judge Eno? No.

45:04.919 --> 45:05.877
[chuckling]:
No.

45:06.051 --> 45:07.922
Why? Because
she's a woman?

45:08.096 --> 45:10.229
No, no, no.
Because...

45:18.585 --> 45:21.327
ENO: Mm. Thank you.
WAITRESS: Gracias.

45:26.898 --> 45:29.770
Judge Eno.
[clears throat]

45:29.944 --> 45:32.077
Counselor.
Is there an issue?

45:32.251 --> 45:34.340
I don't know.
There might be.

45:34.514 --> 45:37.299
Well, if it's about court,
this is ex partecommunication.

45:37.473 --> 45:39.301
It's more of a personal issue,
Your Honor,

45:39.475 --> 45:41.086
and we thought it
best to talk without

45:41.260 --> 45:44.785
a court reporter present.
Why? What personal issue?

45:44.959 --> 45:46.744
You being on the take.

45:48.223 --> 45:49.790
What the hell
are you talking about?

45:49.964 --> 45:51.923
The other side
is paying you.

45:52.097 --> 45:54.099
And we don't want
to make a fuss.

45:54.273 --> 45:56.492
We just want you
to recuse yourself.

45:56.666 --> 45:58.886
Or?

45:59.060 --> 46:02.585
[quietly]: Or we will have
to make an issue of this.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.587
Mm.
Mm.

46:04.762 --> 46:08.113
Well... who told you
I'm on the take?

46:08.287 --> 46:10.115
I'd rather not say.

46:10.289 --> 46:11.986
Mm.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.641
All right, well, then,
you know what I think?

46:14.815 --> 46:17.818
I think this is a bluff,
and kind of a bad one, at that.

46:17.992 --> 46:20.386
[chuckles]
It's not.

46:20.560 --> 46:23.389
All right, well, then,
who told you? Let's hear.

46:23.563 --> 46:26.392
I can't say.
[clicks tongue]

46:26.566 --> 46:29.308
Well...

46:29.482 --> 46:31.527
I guess
the bottom line is, um...

46:32.572 --> 46:33.791
...fuck you.

46:34.835 --> 46:36.663
And fuck you both.

46:36.837 --> 46:38.621
Enjoy your lunch.

46:41.015 --> 46:44.627
Adrian... who did tell you?

46:44.802 --> 46:47.021
I can't say, Diane.

46:47.195 --> 46:49.241
Well, if a judge is corrupt
that needs to come forward.

46:49.415 --> 46:50.503
I know.

46:51.983 --> 46:53.506
I can't say.

47:02.863 --> 47:05.561
There can't be anything
I just did that's worth noting.

47:05.735 --> 47:07.389
Uh, sure there is.

47:07.563 --> 47:09.478
Let me see.

47:09.652 --> 47:11.567
[clears throat]

47:13.831 --> 47:15.354
[chuckles]

47:15.528 --> 47:16.877
Okay, I didn't say
this would be interesting,

47:17.051 --> 47:18.357
I just said it would be real.

47:18.531 --> 47:20.054
Hey, I'm into real.
Okay.

47:20.228 --> 47:22.187
Well, I'm going through
the Helix case,

47:22.361 --> 47:25.233
and in non-TV reality,
I spend most of my time

47:25.407 --> 47:28.149
flipping through files
exactly like this.

47:28.323 --> 47:30.760
And what are you looking for?
Discrepancies.

47:30.935 --> 47:32.850
Small changes in a zero
or a comma.

47:33.024 --> 47:34.416
Something out of place.

47:34.590 --> 47:36.288
And you do it alone?

47:36.462 --> 47:38.203
I do.
You know, in TV,

47:38.377 --> 47:40.074
we'd put someone there with you.

47:40.248 --> 47:41.815
So you can explain
what you're doing.

47:41.989 --> 47:43.991
Do you know this joke?

47:46.037 --> 47:48.866
This is an actor realizing
he forgot his wallet.

47:57.744 --> 47:58.701
This is a non-actor

47:58.876 --> 48:00.834
realizing he forgot his wallet.

48:05.230 --> 48:06.361
Yeah, well, see,
that's why

48:06.535 --> 48:08.189
I don't like TV.
'Cause it's a lie.

48:08.363 --> 48:10.626
Yeah, but what isn't a lie
these days, though?

48:10.800 --> 48:13.673
Politics, art, science.
Everything is TV.

48:13.847 --> 48:17.285
And that's a good thing?
No, it's an important
thing to know.

48:17.459 --> 48:19.809
If your country realized Trump
was cast in The Apprentice

48:19.984 --> 48:21.202
and didn't create it,
things could be

48:21.376 --> 48:23.074
a hell of a lot better
right now.

48:23.248 --> 48:25.337
The original idea for
The Apprenticewas to have

48:25.511 --> 48:27.600
a new CEO each week,
so think about it--

48:27.774 --> 48:29.515
Martha Stewart
could've been president.

48:29.689 --> 48:31.821
[phone rings]

48:31.996 --> 48:33.693
Hello?

48:33.867 --> 48:35.869
Lucca, it's Evelyn. I locked
myself out of your apartment...

48:36.043 --> 48:37.218
You did what?

48:37.392 --> 48:39.220
What's wrong?
No. No, stay there.

48:39.394 --> 48:40.918
I'll be... I'll be 20 minutes.
[Evelyn continues indistinctly]

48:41.092 --> 48:43.007
What's wrong?
Uh, my...

48:43.181 --> 48:44.878
I have to go.
My nanny-- she's locked herself

48:45.052 --> 48:47.011
out of the apartment
and my baby is inside.

48:47.185 --> 48:48.795
You have a baby?

48:48.969 --> 48:49.883
Yeah.

48:50.057 --> 48:51.711
Let's go, I'll drive you.

48:51.885 --> 48:53.756
No, it's-it's fine.
I have a car.

48:53.931 --> 48:56.107
But my driver's downstairs.
He'll take us.

48:58.022 --> 48:59.458
[rain falling outside]

49:05.943 --> 49:08.293
BAILIFF:
All rise.

49:10.512 --> 49:12.819
She's worried.
Ask her to recuse.

49:13.820 --> 49:15.126
Please sit.

49:17.215 --> 49:20.392
Okay.
I certainly heard your

49:20.566 --> 49:23.177
passionate arguments, and I
understand that this is an issue

49:23.351 --> 49:24.700
that we all take

49:24.874 --> 49:26.920
deeply seriously,
but there is

49:27.094 --> 49:29.618
little evidence
that these voting machines

49:29.792 --> 49:31.011
have been compromised.

49:31.185 --> 49:32.839
Your Honor,
I'd like to request...

49:33.013 --> 49:35.276
No, sir.
You... you need to sit.

49:39.933 --> 49:42.109
In fact, I'm a
little puzzled

49:42.283 --> 49:45.417
why people claiming to care
about the integrity

49:45.591 --> 49:46.766
of the voting system

49:46.940 --> 49:49.551
have devoted so many hours

49:49.725 --> 49:50.988
to undermining it.

49:52.902 --> 49:55.557
You have something
to add, counselor?

49:58.256 --> 50:00.388
Well, if not, then...

50:00.562 --> 50:02.042
this case is dismissed

50:02.216 --> 50:03.565
with prejudice.

50:03.739 --> 50:05.306
Your Honor, Your Honor.
Not with prejudice,

50:05.480 --> 50:07.700
that will prevent us
from relitigating this case...

50:07.874 --> 50:09.702
Yeah, you heard me, counselor.

50:09.876 --> 50:12.139
With prejudice.

50:20.887 --> 50:23.498
[speaking indistinctly]

50:25.544 --> 50:27.546
[chimes playing]

50:54.051 --> 50:55.313
Everything good?

50:55.487 --> 50:56.792
Yeah.

50:56.966 --> 50:59.404
I mean... he didn't even notice.

50:59.578 --> 51:01.623
I'm glad.

51:03.234 --> 51:04.496
Well, I should go.

51:06.585 --> 51:08.587
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah. Great.

51:08.761 --> 51:10.197
[baby noises and chimes]

51:12.634 --> 51:15.463
[chuckles]

51:15.637 --> 51:17.074
Okay.

51:18.640 --> 51:20.729
Okay. So, um...

51:20.903 --> 51:22.427
see you.See you.

51:25.256 --> 51:27.040
Oh...

51:30.130 --> 51:31.392
Uh...

51:39.922 --> 51:41.924
I, uh...

51:53.110 --> 51:55.329
[thunder rumbles]

52:07.341 --> 52:10.170
Heard the news.
Tough loss.

52:10.344 --> 52:12.694
How far along are
you in the coding?

52:12.868 --> 52:15.262
Almost done.

52:15.436 --> 52:17.699
And this thing is really
gonna flip Republican votes?

52:17.873 --> 52:19.658
Yes. Why?

52:19.832 --> 52:22.051
You gonna try
to talk me out of it?

52:22.226 --> 52:23.792
No.

52:23.966 --> 52:26.404
I want to push the button.
