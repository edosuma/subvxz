WEBVTT

03:54.656 --> 03:57.427
Lookin' good, Sarah.
You make that
look too easy.

03:57.526 --> 04:00.130
Thanks, Chad. Hey,
I got somethin' for you.

04:00.230 --> 04:01.697
No shit!

04:01.798 --> 04:04.868
This got ripped
off my helmet
on a skydive yesterday.

04:04.968 --> 04:05.802
And survived!

04:05.902 --> 04:07.770
I just found it
in the landing area.

04:07.871 --> 04:10.340
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

04:10.440 --> 04:12.308
That was a pretty
sick landing, Sarah.

04:12.409 --> 04:14.310
Thanks.

04:14.411 --> 04:17.213
- Did you enjoy your solo?
- I did.

04:17.313 --> 04:20.083
You know, you'd have
a lot more fun
jumping with us.

04:20.582 --> 04:21.918
So you keep telling me.

04:22.718 --> 04:23.920
Just 'cause you're
the new girl

04:24.020 --> 04:26.655
doesn't mean
you can't make friends.

04:26.755 --> 04:28.224
You should come out
with us some time.

04:29.392 --> 04:30.726
Is that
your way of asking?

04:30.827 --> 04:33.997
Well, yeah,
I'm not not-asking.

04:34.097 --> 04:35.664
Wow,

04:35.764 --> 04:38.201
I can't say I've ever
heard that line before.

04:39.502 --> 04:41.137
You're not gonna make
this easy on me.

04:41.237 --> 04:42.906
Where's the fun in that?

04:44.541 --> 04:47.709
- You mind if I leave this
here for Kris?
- Yeah, no doubt.

04:53.416 --> 04:54.716
That was classic.

04:54.818 --> 04:57.854
I've never seen Payson
get shut down before.

04:57.954 --> 05:00.857
I don't think it's ever
happened, to be honest.

05:00.957 --> 05:04.194
Just another
cocky Skygod.

05:04.294 --> 05:06.129
Every drop zone has one.

05:08.131 --> 05:09.799
You done
with that packing weight?

05:09.899 --> 05:11.301
Um, yup.

05:16.672 --> 05:18.374
Who was that?

05:18.475 --> 05:19.708
That's Kris.

05:19.809 --> 05:22.412
He's been packing
parachutes
a long time.

05:22.512 --> 05:24.646
- Does he jump?
- Used to.

05:24.746 --> 05:27.951
They say he was
pretty bad-ass
back in the day.

05:28.051 --> 05:30.253
Guess he decided to quit
while he was ahead.

05:30.353 --> 05:32.555
<i>Load 5, gear up.</i>
<i>You're on five-minute call.</i>

05:32.654 --> 05:33.923
<i>Load 5.</i>

05:34.723 --> 05:38.727
Dude, give it up.
It's never gonna happen.

05:39.728 --> 05:41.998
I'm with Wade.
She's never gonna
come around.

05:42.465 --> 05:45.135
You've been trying
to get her to jump with us
since she got here.

05:45.235 --> 05:47.403
What's so special
about her, anyway?

05:47.504 --> 05:48.905
You don't know
who that is?

05:50.106 --> 05:52.142
Skydiving runs
in that girl's blood.

05:52.242 --> 05:55.311
We need a sixth, Lisa.
And she's the one.

05:57.779 --> 05:59.415
Whatever.

06:17.766 --> 06:20.937
- Payson!
- Sorry, sorry.

06:22.071 --> 06:24.407
- I have
a confession to make.
- Oh?

06:24.507 --> 06:27.877
Since when do they
allow women
into the priesthood?

06:27.977 --> 06:29.646
I need something from you.

06:29.745 --> 06:30.947
I just know talent
when I see it,

06:31.047 --> 06:33.917
and right now,
the team could use you.

06:35.385 --> 06:37.921
You ever heard of the phrase,
"I don't want to belong
to any club

06:38.021 --> 06:40.156
that would have me
as a member?"

06:40.256 --> 06:43.493
Yeah, Groucho Marx.

06:43.593 --> 06:46.362
You get points
for knowing that.

06:46.462 --> 06:48.798
Doesn't change the fact
that I like to jump alone.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.907
Jumping alone is
kind of like masturbating.

06:58.007 --> 07:01.678
It'll do in a pinch,
but it's kinda depressing.

07:01.777 --> 07:03.913
Maybe you don't
masturbate right.

07:13.456 --> 07:15.124
Mm-hmm?

07:15.225 --> 07:17.093
A group of us are going
to church later.

07:17.427 --> 07:18.995
You ever been?

07:19.095 --> 07:21.197
What self-respecting girl
hasn't been to church
a few times?

07:21.864 --> 07:23.299
So I'll see you there?

07:24.434 --> 07:26.970
I'll say... maybe.

07:41.317 --> 07:42.185
They missed you.

07:44.354 --> 07:46.022
They're just ducks, Mom.

07:47.991 --> 07:49.259
They don't miss me.

07:52.595 --> 07:53.830
You like it?

07:53.930 --> 07:55.865
It's a new blend
I've been working on.

07:57.567 --> 07:58.901
Yeah.

07:59.002 --> 08:03.772
It's like a mix
between tree bark
and peat moss.

08:03.873 --> 08:05.774
It's healthy.
Just drink it.

08:13.616 --> 08:15.151
It's good
to have you back.

08:16.452 --> 08:18.054
It's good
to be back...

08:19.188 --> 08:20.456
I think.

08:23.192 --> 08:25.995
I was hoping
we could fix things.

08:27.897 --> 08:29.565
I would like that.

08:30.800 --> 08:34.904
Look, before you left,
I let my emotions
get the best of me.

08:37.373 --> 08:39.609
I was angry.

08:39.709 --> 08:41.177
I hope you can
understand that.

08:48.451 --> 08:49.585
Are you still jumping?

08:51.020 --> 08:52.188
We're talking
about fixing things,

08:52.288 --> 08:54.390
and that's where
you want to go?

08:56.192 --> 08:58.728
I'm staying safe,
Mom, don't worry.

08:58.828 --> 09:00.129
What I worry about

09:00.229 --> 09:03.099
is you moving
from place to place,
all by yourself.

09:03.199 --> 09:06.135
You don't stick around
in one place long enough
to make any friends.

09:06.235 --> 09:09.138
I got invited to hang out
with some people tonight.

09:09.238 --> 09:12.442
Well, good.
I hope you're gonna go.

09:12.542 --> 09:14.110
I haven't decided.

09:14.210 --> 09:17.947
Sarah...
you should go.

09:18.881 --> 09:20.483
You need it.

09:59.122 --> 10:01.224
There she is.

10:02.191 --> 10:03.993
Ah, shit.
Thanks a lot.

10:04.093 --> 10:05.595
Guess that means
I'm going first.

10:05.695 --> 10:07.263
Nice to meet you, too.

10:07.363 --> 10:09.399
That's Greg. He bet me
you wouldn't show.

10:09.499 --> 10:12.335
I think he's got
a little crush.

10:12.435 --> 10:13.903
That's Evan.

10:14.003 --> 10:15.138
- Yo.
- Hey.

10:15.238 --> 10:17.173
- Wade, Lisa.
- 'Sup.

10:18.608 --> 10:20.009
What is she
doing here?

10:20.109 --> 10:23.579
Come on, Lisa,
church is for everyone.

10:23.679 --> 10:26.149
Yeah, I still don't get
why they call this church.

10:26.249 --> 10:27.750
'Cause this is where you go
to pray for your life.

10:27.851 --> 10:30.286
Damn, dude,
that's dark.

10:32.021 --> 10:33.990
Welcome
to church, Sarah.

10:34.090 --> 10:36.559
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
He cheats death again.

10:36.659 --> 10:37.693
Whoo-whoo.

10:39.228 --> 10:41.030
So, uh, I hear
you might be joining us

10:41.130 --> 10:44.167
for some formation jumps
tomorrow.

10:44.267 --> 10:45.501
I don't know about that.

10:45.601 --> 10:47.503
I've never done
any formation jumps before.

10:47.603 --> 10:48.638
What?

10:48.738 --> 10:50.406
What do you do
when you skydive?

10:50.506 --> 10:52.375
What, do you just play
"Princess of the Sky"

10:52.475 --> 10:54.010
up there all by yourself?

10:54.110 --> 10:56.814
I guess I've just always
kept to myself.

10:56.914 --> 10:58.114
I like it that way.

10:58.214 --> 11:00.483
I wonder if other people
like it that way, too.

11:01.885 --> 11:03.786
So, listen, uh,

11:03.887 --> 11:06.924
now that we finally
have six people...

11:07.023 --> 11:08.691
I think we should
try "The Hex."

11:12.094 --> 11:14.063
You guys gonna jump
or what?

11:15.231 --> 11:18.334
That seems like a bad idea,
but what do I know?

11:18.434 --> 11:19.702
Let's go, Wade.

11:20.736 --> 11:22.004
See ya.

11:24.140 --> 11:25.876
Bombs away.

11:26.008 --> 11:27.443
Whoo!

11:29.745 --> 11:32.381
Go, go, go!

11:32.482 --> 11:35.017
- Ooo!
-  - Hurry up and land, Wade.

11:35.117 --> 11:37.353
Coming in hot, Lisa.

11:42.793 --> 11:44.327
So, hey...

11:45.995 --> 11:48.331
- The Hex?
- Yeah.

11:49.867 --> 11:51.300
For real?
I mean, come on.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.536
I'd expect this
from Wade, but not you.

11:54.805 --> 11:56.472
It's just--

11:56.572 --> 11:59.475
I mean, we've all
heard the stories.

11:59.575 --> 12:02.745
I mean, you believe every story
you hear at the drop zone?

12:02.846 --> 12:04.714
Hey, trust me.

12:04.815 --> 12:07.016
Have I ever
steered you wrong?

12:10.553 --> 12:11.787
Okay.

12:21.731 --> 12:23.432
Have a good jump, Sarah.

12:23.533 --> 12:24.667
Thanks.

12:33.877 --> 12:35.411
Whoo.

12:36.980 --> 12:38.314
Whoo!

12:38.414 --> 12:41.317
Listen, I didn't mean
to assume anything.

12:41.417 --> 12:43.954
I know you haven't agreed
to jump with us.

12:44.053 --> 12:47.657
And I'm sorry I said
jumping alone was lame.

12:47.757 --> 12:49.058
Uh, it's okay.

12:49.158 --> 12:51.795
I'm sorry I questioned
your masturbating skills.

12:54.730 --> 12:57.333
So, what's the Hex?

12:57.433 --> 13:00.003
It's this jump
I've always wanted to do,

13:00.102 --> 13:02.071
but you need six people.

13:02.171 --> 13:04.307
- Six talented people.
- Ah.

13:05.241 --> 13:06.843
What do you say?

13:12.315 --> 13:14.083
See you in the morning.

13:15.953 --> 13:17.054
Whoo.

13:51.520 --> 13:54.256
This jump? It's true,
you need six people.

13:54.357 --> 13:56.125
But the reason
it's called the Hex

13:56.225 --> 13:59.562
is a couple of people
have died trying it.

13:59.662 --> 14:01.031
Seriously?

14:01.130 --> 14:02.899
That's
just an urban legend.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.469
Nobody's ever died
doing the Hex.

14:06.569 --> 14:08.738
We can do something else
if you're uncomfortable, Sarah.

14:09.171 --> 14:10.573
You could just film us.

14:10.673 --> 14:13.409
I'm not much
of a bystander, Lisa.
Thanks, though.

14:13.509 --> 14:14.878
That's what I'm talking about!

14:14.978 --> 14:16.345
No, not the white board!

14:16.445 --> 14:18.115
I hate
the white board.

14:18.214 --> 14:21.018
Yes, Wade. I know you do,
and I thought you might
have a hard time

14:21.118 --> 14:23.452
visualizing
this particular jump.

14:23.552 --> 14:24.620
So here...

14:26.789 --> 14:29.026
I made this just for you.

14:29.126 --> 14:30.359
Ooh.

14:30.459 --> 14:32.595
- Really?
- We fly like this,

14:32.695 --> 14:34.296
and on my key...

14:35.932 --> 14:39.635
Key... huh?

14:41.203 --> 14:43.106
Hardy-fucking-har.

14:44.473 --> 14:46.375
Fuck me, this actually
does help, though.

14:46.475 --> 14:48.411
Just try not to...

14:48.511 --> 14:51.048
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, baby.

14:51.148 --> 14:53.116
Oh, no, don't do it.

15:05.128 --> 15:08.932
Remember, a collision
at these speeds
can knock you out cold.

15:09.032 --> 15:10.934
Err on the side of caution.

15:11.034 --> 15:12.568
We all have to die.

15:12.668 --> 15:15.738
But we don't have
to die today!

15:17.406 --> 15:20.911
That's right,
smart asses. Gear up.

15:23.579 --> 15:25.548
Looks like your altimeter's
sticking.

15:26.950 --> 15:29.452
Yeah, it does that
sometimes.

15:29.552 --> 15:32.455
It's all right.
My eyes can be my altimeter.

15:32.555 --> 15:35.192
I really don't think Sarah
should be center.

15:35.291 --> 15:36.860
It's her first time doing
any kind of formation,

15:36.960 --> 15:39.963
and you're putting her right
in the most dangerous slot.

15:40.063 --> 15:41.131
She'll be fine.

15:41.230 --> 15:44.000
Try thinking
with your other head?

15:44.101 --> 15:47.737
If anything happens to her,
it's gonna be your fault.

15:47.838 --> 15:49.139
Um, hi, guys.

15:49.238 --> 15:50.841
You know, I'm sitting
right here.

15:50.941 --> 15:54.010
Don't let her rattle you.
Lisa can be a little
overdramatic at times.

15:54.111 --> 15:55.578
Eat a dick, Greg.

15:56.880 --> 15:57.814
You'll be great.

15:57.914 --> 16:00.349
Yeah, and if you really
want to be great,

16:00.449 --> 16:02.018
you can flash
the pilot your boobs,

16:02.119 --> 16:03.954
and he'll give us
some extra altitude!

16:04.054 --> 16:05.021
In your dreams.

16:08.724 --> 16:11.228
All right,
everybody on comms!

16:11.327 --> 16:13.662
- Let's do this!
- Aw, yeah.

16:14.798 --> 16:18.467
Hey, Payson, what's
the capital of Thailand?

16:18.567 --> 16:19.702
What?

16:19.803 --> 16:21.370
- Bang Cock!
- Never gets old.

16:21.470 --> 16:24.841
Ow, fucker. Just get
in the damn door, Evan.

16:24.941 --> 16:25.809
Let's get it on.

16:36.352 --> 16:38.387
Ready, set, go!

16:48.764 --> 16:50.466
<i>Nice and easy, Sarah.</i>

16:50.566 --> 16:53.435
<i>Nice and easy yourself.</i>
<i>I am in my slot.</i>

16:58.108 --> 17:01.044
<i>Okay, looking good,</i>
<i>everybody.</i>

17:02.611 --> 17:04.413
<i>Watch your levels.</i>

17:07.250 --> 17:10.686
<i>Ready... and...</i>

17:10.786 --> 17:12.555
<i>key!</i>

17:12.655 --> 17:14.423
<i>Oh, shit,</i>
<i>I'm losing it.</i>

17:14.523 --> 17:16.193
<i>Whoa, whoa,</i>
<i>whoa! Fuck! Shit!</i>

17:16.293 --> 17:18.394
<i>What the hell?!</i>

17:18.494 --> 17:20.329
<i>Well, guys,</i>
<i>that sucked.</i>

17:20.429 --> 17:22.598
<i>Break off.</i>
<i>Break off.</i>

17:35.011 --> 17:36.179
<i>Everybody good?</i>

17:36.279 --> 17:37.981
- <i>Greg's fine.</i>
<i>- Roger.</i>

17:38.081 --> 17:40.851
- <i>Go for Wade.</i>
<i>- Sarah's good.</i>

17:40.951 --> 17:42.085
<i>Is she, though?</i>

17:42.185 --> 17:44.687
<i>All right,</i>
<i>see you guys on the ground.</i>

17:49.893 --> 17:50.827
Whoo.

18:19.856 --> 18:21.358
How'd it go?

18:21.457 --> 18:23.026
Good enough.

18:23.827 --> 18:25.795
We can do better,
though.

18:42.212 --> 18:44.214
Here she comes.
She's coming. She's coming.

18:44.314 --> 18:45.648
Sorry about that, guys.

18:45.748 --> 18:47.583
My foot clipped Wade's head,
and I-I kinda bugged out.

18:47.683 --> 18:49.352
Hey, hey, no sweat.

18:49.451 --> 18:50.954
I got somethin' for ya.

18:52.389 --> 18:53.455
Homie hat!

18:56.458 --> 18:59.495
Ah, don't worry about it.
It's like a skydiving
dunce cap.

18:59.595 --> 19:01.364
- Yeah, it is.
- We've all been there.

19:01.463 --> 19:03.599
- Looks good on her.
- Was that seriously your first formation?

19:04.100 --> 19:06.769
Why, so you can make
a bunch of virgin jokes?

19:06.870 --> 19:08.204
I told you that
last night.

19:08.305 --> 19:10.840
No, because
if it really
was your first time,

19:10.941 --> 19:12.809
then that means...

19:12.909 --> 19:15.011
Sarah's buying!

19:21.650 --> 19:25.121
So, are you stoked
on that jump or what?

19:25.221 --> 19:26.722
Yes.

19:26.823 --> 19:29.525
I mean, it-it does suck
that I messed it up,

19:29.625 --> 19:30.827
but...

19:30.927 --> 19:32.528
maybe I shouldn't expect
much on my first try.

19:32.628 --> 19:33.997
Nah, don't even sweat it.

19:34.097 --> 19:36.532
This crew's been jumping
together a while now.

19:36.632 --> 19:39.369
If I had a dollar
for every jump
that I fucked up,

19:39.468 --> 19:40.636
I could pay
for this beer...

19:40.736 --> 19:43.139
...and some pizza.

19:46.376 --> 19:48.144
- Who's that?
- My mother.

19:48.244 --> 19:49.545
If she knows
I've been out jumping

19:49.645 --> 19:51.414
and hasn't heard from me
by sunset,

19:51.513 --> 19:53.016
she tends
to assume the worst.

19:53.116 --> 19:54.516
Why's that?

19:54.616 --> 19:57.120
Did you have
a friend go in
or something?

19:58.587 --> 20:00.489
Something like that.

20:01.825 --> 20:04.294
Somebody close to you?

20:04.394 --> 20:05.661
Yeah.

20:06.896 --> 20:09.199
Is that why
you jump alone?

20:09.299 --> 20:10.834
That's part of it.

20:10.934 --> 20:12.268
I've only been jumping
a couple of years.

20:12.369 --> 20:15.939
I never had a friend
die skydiving.

20:16.039 --> 20:17.273
You will.

20:19.309 --> 20:21.111
Eventually, we all do.

20:56.578 --> 20:58.547
All right, guys.
Now listen up.

21:00.817 --> 21:02.185
Hang on. Wait a second.

21:02.285 --> 21:04.686
All right, so I want to run
the Hex again tomorrow.

21:04.787 --> 21:06.588
This time,
with no mistakes.

21:06.688 --> 21:09.725
I think we can all agree
that we put a little
too much stress on Sarah

21:09.826 --> 21:11.494
by putting her in the middle.

21:11.593 --> 21:13.662
I think we can also agree
that somebody already tried
to tell you that.

21:13.762 --> 21:16.632
Which is why
I'm going to be
taking the center.

21:16.732 --> 21:18.835
- Whoo!
- Sarah...

21:20.103 --> 21:22.272
You'll be right here
across from me.

21:23.440 --> 21:26.675
Evan...
you're right here.

21:28.044 --> 21:28.978
Greg...

21:29.079 --> 21:35.018
you'll be right here
between Lisa and Wade.

21:37.287 --> 21:40.924
Guys, if this was easy,
everyone would do it.

21:43.293 --> 21:46.296
Get some rest,
and I'll see you
at the ass-crack of dawn.

21:50.033 --> 21:51.501
All right,
see you, Payson.

21:55.405 --> 21:58.908
Whatever. Wade,
come on, let's go.

21:59.008 --> 22:04.380
I guess we're leaving.
I'm riding with you.
I'm out, bro.

22:04.481 --> 22:06.049
Lisa, wait up.

22:06.149 --> 22:07.783
She loves me.

22:08.985 --> 22:11.020
Don't take it
too personally.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.721
Lisa's just jealous.

22:12.822 --> 22:15.992
And she doesn't have
a terribly high emotional IQ.

22:16.092 --> 22:19.395
That's stupid.
She's just as good
a skydiver as I am.

22:19.496 --> 22:21.630
Not that. Payson.

22:24.534 --> 22:26.102
Are they a thing?

22:26.202 --> 22:29.771
Used to be. Lisa still
wants them to be.

22:29.873 --> 22:31.975
But that was never
gonna work out.

22:32.075 --> 22:35.211
They don't seem
exactly compatible.

22:36.279 --> 22:38.214
She's fucking crazy!

22:38.314 --> 22:40.316
Oh, good.

22:43.253 --> 22:46.122
You take the bad
with the good, I guess.

22:46.222 --> 22:49.159
She deals with enough
of our shit,
that's for sure.

22:52.362 --> 22:53.997
See ya dark and early.

23:19.923 --> 23:23.393
Hey. You want a beer?

23:23.493 --> 23:25.195
Much obliged.

23:28.531 --> 23:30.433
I saw you guys
tried the Hex today.

23:33.303 --> 23:37.874
Yeah, but I fucked it up.
Obviously.

23:39.509 --> 23:40.977
No shame in that.

23:41.544 --> 23:43.446
The Hex is
a tough formation.

23:44.447 --> 23:47.850
Maybe a handful
of people in the world
that could pull it off.

23:49.519 --> 23:50.987
Have you seen it done?

23:52.222 --> 23:53.289
I have.

23:54.490 --> 23:56.993
Trying it again tomorrow.

23:58.127 --> 23:59.429
Wow!

24:01.331 --> 24:03.166
Good luck.

24:07.503 --> 24:08.438
Thanks.

24:30.360 --> 24:32.795
Do you know how bad
those things are for you?

24:32.895 --> 24:35.064
Yeah, well, we're all
gonna croak sometime.

24:35.164 --> 24:39.235
Yeah, but taurine overdose
seems like a pretty
stupid reason.

24:39.335 --> 24:42.538
Yeah, well, you die
your way, cupcake.
I'll die mine.

24:49.245 --> 24:51.481
All right,
skydive! Whoo!

24:51.581 --> 24:52.849
Oh!

24:57.587 --> 24:58.621
How's it going, Jerry?

24:58.721 --> 25:00.223
Payson!
How you doing, man?

25:00.323 --> 25:03.559
Not quite as well as you,
by the looks of things.

25:03.660 --> 25:04.627
And what's your name?

25:04.727 --> 25:05.762
Her name's Ingrid.

25:05.862 --> 25:07.764
Only speaks
a few words of English.

25:07.864 --> 25:09.732
Ingrid, huh?

25:09.832 --> 25:11.467
You lucky bastard.

25:12.635 --> 25:13.736
Come on, let's load up.

25:25.581 --> 25:28.217
Good morning, L.A. center,
jump 2 is lighting up.

25:28.318 --> 25:31.020
We'll be climbing
at 12,000 feet this mornin'.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.889
Appreciate any advisories.

25:34.724 --> 25:37.827
<i>Jump 2, L.A.</i>
<i>center, good morning.</i>

25:37.927 --> 25:42.899
<i>Advise when you're wheels up.</i>
<i>Expect clear skies</i>
<i>from one to two thousand.</i>

25:42.999 --> 25:45.201
<i>Be advised moderate</i>
<i>to severe turbulence reported</i>

25:45.301 --> 25:48.604
<i>all the way to 15,000 feet.</i>

25:48.705 --> 25:51.841
<i>Buckle up, jump 2.</i>
<i>It's gonna be a bumpy ride.</i>

25:53.276 --> 25:55.311
<i>Copy that. We're rolling.</i>

26:26.109 --> 26:27.443
Hey, Jer,

26:27.543 --> 26:30.446
what about getting
a little extra altitude, huh?

26:30.546 --> 26:32.148
I'm not askin' her.

26:33.015 --> 26:36.352
Hey, Ingrid, do you want
the plane to go higher?

26:36.452 --> 26:39.756
Yeah, Ingrid,
have a longer skydive?

26:39.857 --> 26:40.957
Yeah, sure.
Okay.

26:41.057 --> 26:42.925
All you have to do is....

26:43.025 --> 26:44.494
Show the boobs
to the pilot,

26:44.594 --> 26:47.630
and he'll take us up
an extra thousand feet.

26:47.730 --> 26:49.399
I-I wouldn't lie to you.

26:50.900 --> 26:52.034
Yo, Andy!

26:52.135 --> 26:54.103
Ingrid wants
to show you something!

27:02.779 --> 27:04.213
Sorry about that, folks!

27:04.313 --> 27:06.516
I think the man upstairs
gave us some turbulence

27:06.616 --> 27:09.519
just to make those beautiful
titties bounce!

27:09.619 --> 27:12.588
I'd say that's definitely
worth some extra altitude!

27:15.826 --> 27:16.993
What'd I miss?

27:25.836 --> 27:27.303
Crouch down for me.

27:27.403 --> 27:30.239
Here we go!
Ready, steady, go!

27:41.551 --> 27:43.286
All right, guys.
Here we go.

27:43.386 --> 27:45.588
Ready, set, go!

28:22.558 --> 28:24.760
<i>All right, guys,</i>
<i>here we go.</i>

28:24.862 --> 28:27.263
<i>Ready... key!</i>

28:29.699 --> 28:32.268
<i>And key!</i>

28:33.102 --> 28:34.872
<i>Come on, guys, you got it.</i>

28:34.972 --> 28:36.706
<i>Come on, don't let go.</i>

28:36.807 --> 28:38.474
<i>Holy shit, we did it.</i>

28:38.574 --> 28:39.575
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:40.944 --> 28:42.678
<i>Yeah, you!</i>
<i>Ha-ha! All right!</i>

28:42.778 --> 28:44.213
<i>Yeah! Whoo!</i>

28:44.313 --> 28:45.916
<i>That's what I'm</i>
<i>talking about!</i>

28:46.015 --> 28:47.818
<i>Yeah! Awesome!</i>
<i>We got it guys!</i>

28:47.918 --> 28:51.387
- <i>Holy shit,</i>
<i>that was bad-ass.</i>

28:51.487 --> 28:53.322
<i>Good job, guys.</i>
<i>Good shit.</i>

28:54.323 --> 28:55.959
<i>What the fuck</i>
<i>just happened?</i>

28:56.058 --> 28:57.895
- <i>Did I just</i> <i>fucking see that?
- </i> - <i>Oh, my God!</i>

28:57.995 --> 29:00.162
<i>- </i> <i>What the fuck, man?</i>
<i>- Does anyone see him?</i>

29:00.263 --> 29:02.331
<i>We gotta go.</i>
<i>We gotta go. Break off!</i>

29:15.578 --> 29:17.413
<i>Evan, do you</i>
<i>see him anywhere?</i>

29:17.513 --> 29:19.248
<i>I don't see</i>
<i>his parachute.</i>

29:19.348 --> 29:21.450
<i>I don't see him.</i>

29:28.658 --> 29:31.761
- Where's Payson?
- I don't know.

29:31.862 --> 29:33.396
- Where the hell is he?
- He's gone.

29:33.496 --> 29:35.032
All of a sudden,
he was just gone!

29:35.131 --> 29:36.566
Guys, guys.

29:36.666 --> 29:38.701
It was like he was there
one second, and then
he wasn't.

29:38.802 --> 29:40.236
He must have pulled early.

29:40.336 --> 29:42.005
If he pulled early,
we'd be able to see
his canopy.

29:42.104 --> 29:43.840
Unless it didn't open.

29:53.182 --> 29:54.550
- Disappeared?
- Yeah.

29:54.650 --> 29:56.285
Bill, I know
how this sounds,
but I saw what I saw.

29:56.385 --> 29:58.554
Guys, I've owned
this drop zone
for 22 years.

29:58.654 --> 30:00.256
Nobody has ever
just disappeared.

30:00.356 --> 30:02.491
But that's what happened.

30:02.592 --> 30:04.527
Here's what we'll do.
I'll grab a bunch of people.

30:04.627 --> 30:06.462
We'll get them out
in their cars
searching for him.

30:06.562 --> 30:08.698
We'll find him
on the side of the road
packing his parachute.

30:08.799 --> 30:11.001
Somebody should call
the cops, or the paramedics
or whatever.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.501
Man, we don't even know
if he's injured.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.071
He could be stuck
in a tree somewhere

30:14.170 --> 30:15.538
or landed
in someone's backyard.

30:15.638 --> 30:17.173
Right. I can drive.
I can help look.

30:17.273 --> 30:19.342
- I'll go with you.
- All right, let's go.

30:21.845 --> 30:24.480
It's just--
I consider myself
a rational person,

30:24.580 --> 30:26.917
and I'm having
a really hard time with this.

30:27.017 --> 30:29.552
I mean, what did you see?

30:29.652 --> 30:31.654
I saw what you saw.

30:33.289 --> 30:35.458
I guess it's possible
he could have just...

30:35.558 --> 30:37.828
I don't know,
had some sort
of canopy malfunction

30:37.928 --> 30:39.228
and had to cut away.

30:39.328 --> 30:41.764
I just feel like one of us
would have seen something.

30:44.233 --> 30:46.036
That's my worst nightmare.

30:46.135 --> 30:47.904
Having to cut away.

30:48.005 --> 30:50.439
- You never had to?
- Nope.

30:51.374 --> 30:53.209
Not that big
of a deal, really.

30:53.309 --> 30:55.979
I mean, when it happens,
it's like time slows way down.

30:56.079 --> 30:57.780
You know what I mean?

30:57.881 --> 30:59.049
And then you just...

30:59.148 --> 31:00.516
Pull your cut-away handle
to lose the mess,

31:00.616 --> 31:03.053
pull your reserve handle
to save your life.

31:03.152 --> 31:05.889
Everyone has to do it,
sooner or later.

31:05.989 --> 31:08.758
There's a part of me
that just wishes
it would happen.

31:08.859 --> 31:11.560
Then maybe it wouldn't
scare me so much.

31:12.929 --> 31:14.163
It wakes me up at night.

31:14.263 --> 31:16.133
My canopy malfunctions,
and for whatever reason,

31:16.232 --> 31:19.535
I can't control it.
I can't cut away.

31:19.635 --> 31:21.537
I used to have
dreams like that.

31:21.637 --> 31:22.605
Used to?

31:22.705 --> 31:24.373
Now I have nightmares
we're about to crash.

31:24.473 --> 31:27.343
I'm stuck inside the plane
and can't get out the door.

31:30.780 --> 31:32.548
Hey, stop here.

31:55.105 --> 31:56.639
If we don't find him soon,

31:56.739 --> 32:00.077
the chances of finding him
at all are gonna be
pretty slim.

32:00.177 --> 32:03.379
Damn it, Payson.
Where the hell are you?

32:06.549 --> 32:07.884
Come on.

32:26.268 --> 32:28.404
<i>We covered</i>
<i>as much as we could.</i>

32:28.504 --> 32:29.772
<i>There's no sign of him.</i>

32:29.873 --> 32:31.540
All right, copy that.

32:35.611 --> 32:37.848
Andy circled with a spotter
'til it got dark.

32:37.948 --> 32:39.015
They didn't see anything.

32:40.050 --> 32:41.650
- And the cops?
- Nothin'.

32:42.819 --> 32:43.987
They're waiting inside.

32:44.087 --> 32:46.255
Sarah, they want
to talk to you.

32:55.232 --> 32:59.401
Yeah, that's, uh,
pretty much what I heard
from everyone else.

32:59.502 --> 33:01.204
Now, I have to ask.

33:01.303 --> 33:04.473
Did any of you partake
in any controlled substances
when you went up?

33:06.408 --> 33:09.179
We weren't high,
if that's what you're asking.

33:09.278 --> 33:13.682
Okay. Well, maybe it was
an alien abduction.

33:13.783 --> 33:16.219
Maybe a UFO swooped in
and scooped him up

33:16.318 --> 33:17.821
with a tractor beam.

33:17.921 --> 33:20.157
You think this is funny?

33:20.257 --> 33:21.657
Not at all.

33:21.757 --> 33:23.827
He could be dead or--
or dying out there
somewhere,

33:23.927 --> 33:26.662
and you're sitting here
cracking jokes?

33:26.762 --> 33:27.696
Maybe.

33:28.697 --> 33:29.866
Or maybe...

33:29.966 --> 33:32.135
I don't know, he's sipping
Mai Tais in Palm Springs.

33:32.235 --> 33:33.302
What do you think?

33:33.904 --> 33:36.006
What the hell
are you talking about?

33:36.106 --> 33:37.573
Look at the video!

33:37.673 --> 33:39.508
Oh, I have them all
right here.

33:40.409 --> 33:41.912
How about this video?

33:47.184 --> 33:48.717
This one?

33:51.487 --> 33:52.989
What about this one?

33:55.892 --> 33:58.761
Your friend's not
on any of these videos.

34:00.063 --> 34:01.798
He may very well be missing.

34:01.898 --> 34:05.068
But something
about your story's
not checking out.

35:58.982 --> 36:00.383
<i>Get up.</i>

36:06.455 --> 36:08.158
Another point for me.

36:09.159 --> 36:11.027
I shut her down again.

36:28.445 --> 36:29.813
Oh!

36:53.569 --> 36:54.838
Payson?

37:08.485 --> 37:09.819
Jesus fucking Christ!

37:10.786 --> 37:11.955
Payson, what the--

37:12.055 --> 37:13.156
Get up!

37:17.394 --> 37:19.262
What the fuck?

38:47.517 --> 38:49.052
Shit!

39:15.512 --> 39:17.080
<i>Hurry.</i>

40:20.910 --> 40:22.178
Open the door.

40:22.278 --> 40:23.813
Payson! Oh, my God!

40:26.816 --> 40:27.749
Payson.

40:53.042 --> 40:55.144
That's the dumbest story
I ever heard.

40:56.546 --> 40:57.779
You had a bad dream
last night

40:57.880 --> 40:59.415
because of what happened
yesterday.

40:59.515 --> 41:00.817
That's it.

41:00.917 --> 41:02.986
I didn't sleep great
last night either.

41:03.086 --> 41:05.455
This is more
than just a bad dream, Lisa.

41:06.823 --> 41:08.091
Show her.

41:10.827 --> 41:12.328
This is Payson's, isn't it?

41:13.363 --> 41:15.098
Just found it
on the ground last night.

41:15.198 --> 41:17.200
What the fuck, Wade?
How do you have
his altimeter?

41:17.300 --> 41:18.401
I don't know.

41:18.501 --> 41:20.903
I'm pretty sure he had it
on the jump yesterday.

41:21.004 --> 41:22.405
Yeah, he definitely
had it.

41:22.505 --> 41:24.941
I remember because I noticed
it was sticking the other day.

41:25.041 --> 41:26.442
It was stuck on zero.

41:26.542 --> 41:29.078
Well, you guys jump
if you want to. I'm out of here.

41:33.782 --> 41:36.185
She's fine.
She'll be back tomorrow.

41:37.320 --> 41:40.123
What do you think, Evan?
You've been pretty quiet.

41:41.790 --> 41:43.059
Payson.

41:45.495 --> 41:47.063
Do we think he's dead?

41:48.031 --> 41:51.467
And if he is,
who did you guys
see last night?

41:51.567 --> 41:52.969
All right, look.

41:53.069 --> 41:54.871
We still don't know
what happened to Payson.

41:54.971 --> 41:57.507
But whatever happened,
he's not haunting us.

42:02.011 --> 42:04.013
I didn't think you guys
would make it in today.

42:04.113 --> 42:06.249
Well, we're all
about getting back
on the horse.

42:06.349 --> 42:09.018
- All right.
Be safe out there.
- Will do.

42:15.091 --> 42:17.327
It's our own fault,
you know?

42:17.427 --> 42:20.697
- For trying the Hex.
- Come on, a cursed skydive?

42:20.798 --> 42:22.065
Are you kidding me?

42:22.165 --> 42:24.100
It wasn't the formation,

42:24.200 --> 42:26.035
and we don't even know
for sure Payson's even dead.

42:26.135 --> 42:29.706
I'm sure. I saw him
last night, too.

42:29.807 --> 42:31.507
Only he said something to me.

42:39.515 --> 42:40.583
What'd he say,
dude?

42:43.553 --> 42:45.421
He said,
"You're next, Evan."

42:47.990 --> 42:49.959
Like next, next?

42:51.961 --> 42:53.797
Guys, okay. May-maybe
Lisa's right.

42:53.896 --> 42:57.133
We're probably just suffering
from some sort of post-traumatic
stress or something.

43:13.049 --> 43:14.650
You guys want
to make a plan or what?

43:14.751 --> 43:17.954
No. I'm doing a solo.

43:27.964 --> 43:29.132
Think you can catch me?

43:29.232 --> 43:31.334
With one arm tied
behind my back.

43:31.434 --> 43:33.503
I'll even give you
a head start.

43:57.727 --> 43:58.961
<i>Oh, come on, Evan.</i>

43:59.061 --> 44:01.164
<i>You got to make me work</i>
<i>for it a little bit.</i>

44:02.732 --> 44:04.267
<i>Evan?</i>

44:05.968 --> 44:07.703
<i>Come on, Evan,</i>
<i>stop playing around.</i>

44:09.372 --> 44:10.440
<i>Evan?</i>

44:11.441 --> 44:12.675
<i>This isn't funny.</i>

44:14.310 --> 44:15.244
<i>Evan?</i>

44:16.245 --> 44:17.747
<i>Evan?</i>

44:17.848 --> 44:19.817
<i>Evan! Oh, my God!</i>

44:19.917 --> 44:21.517
<i>Evan!</i>

44:21.617 --> 44:22.952
<i>Come on!</i>

44:24.253 --> 44:25.856
<i>Come on, Evan!</i>

44:29.659 --> 44:31.661
<i>No! Shit!</i>

44:38.601 --> 44:39.635
<i>Evan!</i>

44:42.305 --> 44:44.574
<i>Evan, I'm gonna</i>
<i>jump you out.</i>

44:44.674 --> 44:46.175
<i>Come on, wake up.</i>

44:46.275 --> 44:48.211
<i>Come on, wake up!</i>

44:48.311 --> 44:49.312
<i>Come on!</i>

45:04.994 --> 45:07.730
<i>Evan, you've got to fly</i>
<i>your parachute.</i>

45:11.100 --> 45:12.702
<i>Evan, can you hear me?</i>

45:15.438 --> 45:17.673
<i>Come on, Evan,</i>
<i>you've got to wake up.</i>

45:32.054 --> 45:33.422
Evan!

45:33.523 --> 45:35.558
Oh, God, Evan!

45:35.658 --> 45:36.659
Oh!

45:38.361 --> 45:39.495
Shit!

45:39.595 --> 45:40.864
Guys, help!

45:40.964 --> 45:42.231
- Sarah!
- What happened?

45:42.331 --> 45:45.601
- Is he okay?
- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

45:45.701 --> 45:47.670
Fuck! Help!

45:50.139 --> 45:52.041
Oh, my God!
What the fuck?!

45:53.109 --> 45:55.177
Hey! Evan! Hey, hey!

45:58.214 --> 46:00.249
His heart
isn't beating. Evan!

46:00.349 --> 46:01.784
Oh, man, this is bad.

46:01.885 --> 46:03.152
Holy shit.
He's not breathing.

46:03.252 --> 46:07.690
- Dude, he's not breathing.
- Evan!

46:30.047 --> 46:32.114
Wade went to tell Lisa
what happened.

46:33.249 --> 46:35.251
You did everything
you could.

46:37.086 --> 46:38.688
The paramedics said
it was cardiac arrest.

46:38.788 --> 46:42.025
He was probably dead
before he even hit
the ground.

46:42.124 --> 46:43.459
Cardiac arrest?

46:47.064 --> 46:49.131
Doesn't sound
very likely, does it?

46:50.232 --> 46:52.268
How long have you
been jumping, Greg?

46:54.203 --> 46:57.607
About five
or six years. Why?

46:57.707 --> 47:01.544
And have you ever heard
of anything like this
happening before?

47:01.644 --> 47:03.379
To someone his age?

47:06.083 --> 47:07.350
No.

47:27.104 --> 47:28.571
Is this who I think it is?

47:29.338 --> 47:30.941
That's me and my Dad.

47:31.540 --> 47:33.910
That's the last picture
we ever took together.

47:34.978 --> 47:37.446
I've just heard
so many awesome stories
about him.

47:38.949 --> 47:41.417
Yeah. There's
a lot of those.

47:42.752 --> 47:46.056
He designed some of the best
freefly formations ever.

47:46.155 --> 47:47.223
He's a legend.

47:47.858 --> 47:50.861
I take it he's the reason
you started skydiving?

47:51.094 --> 47:52.628
Yeah.

47:52.728 --> 47:55.398
He and his friends
made it look
so cool, you know?

47:55.498 --> 47:58.434
Even when I was little,
I wanted to be just like him.

47:59.235 --> 48:01.170
I'm sure he'd be
proud of you.

48:03.106 --> 48:04.975
I wish my mom
thought that way.

48:05.775 --> 48:09.612
After I made my first jump,
I think she was ready
to disown me.

48:10.613 --> 48:13.382
I think that's
a typical reaction
from a mom, though, isn't it?

48:14.717 --> 48:18.788
It was more than just that.
So I left.

48:20.857 --> 48:22.525
Yeah, and now
you're back.

48:24.226 --> 48:25.361
Yeah.

48:27.430 --> 48:29.265
Great timing, huh?

48:34.037 --> 48:36.439
I don't think
these last two days
have even hit me yet.

48:37.540 --> 48:39.742
It's not going to be easy
when it does.

48:43.512 --> 48:45.481
I just can't believe
what's happened.

49:13.910 --> 49:16.146
That was...
unexpected.

49:16.847 --> 49:20.016
- Are you complaining?
- Not at all.

49:22.618 --> 49:25.321
So, what took you so long
to jump with us?

49:27.423 --> 49:29.558
It's not
that I didn't want to.

49:30.093 --> 49:30.994
It's just...

49:31.761 --> 49:33.629
I've never been
good at making friends.

49:34.263 --> 49:35.464
Why not?

49:39.035 --> 49:40.904
If I don't let anyone
get close...

49:42.505 --> 49:44.406
I can't leave
anyone behind.

49:47.177 --> 49:49.146
Shouldn't you let the people
who want to get close to you

49:49.246 --> 49:51.614
decide whether or not
they want to take
that chance?

49:53.282 --> 49:55.218
Maybe.

49:55.317 --> 49:56.987
But there's also
the flip side.

49:57.087 --> 49:58.521
When somebody dies
at the drop zone,

49:58.621 --> 50:03.592
it's easier
if it's... just some guy.

50:04.995 --> 50:06.830
Harder when it's
your friend...

50:08.064 --> 50:09.498
like Evan.

50:11.201 --> 50:13.502
Or Payson.

50:16.106 --> 50:20.277
Listen,
what happened to Evan
was just bad luck.

50:20.643 --> 50:22.745
And yeah, the timing is
a little weird, I admit.

50:22.979 --> 50:25.314
But we're gonna find out
what happened to Payson.

50:26.549 --> 50:28.018
And if he's dead?

50:29.152 --> 50:32.354
Then at least he died
doing something
that he loved.

50:33.190 --> 50:35.158
That's such
a fucking cop-out.

50:36.259 --> 50:39.662
Don't you think
that Evan would be happy
to never make another skydive

50:39.762 --> 50:41.965
if it meant that he
could still be alive?

51:09.125 --> 51:10.392
<i>Hurry!</i>

51:46.296 --> 51:48.397
<i>Open the door.</i>

52:03.880 --> 52:05.815
- Sarah!
- Greg!

52:10.686 --> 52:12.488
Greg, open the door!

52:27.603 --> 52:30.340
Oh, my God!

52:50.994 --> 52:53.729
Don't seem to have much luck
with the fellas, do you?

52:55.131 --> 52:57.968
Two dead guys
and one missing
in so many days.

52:59.235 --> 53:01.670
- And?
- And I'm just saying.

53:02.272 --> 53:04.506
Doesn't exactly paint you
in the most flattering light.

53:21.458 --> 53:22.658
Listen...

53:23.994 --> 53:25.761
I don't think
that you did this.

53:26.963 --> 53:29.065
But it did happen
under your roof.

53:31.700 --> 53:34.237
Are you sure
there's nothing else
you want to tell me?

53:37.140 --> 53:39.042
I've told you everything.

53:42.711 --> 53:44.280
I'll be in touch.

53:54.424 --> 53:55.892
Lisa!

53:55.992 --> 53:58.495
- You happy now?
- What the hell
is your problem?

53:58.594 --> 54:00.897
You! You're
everyone's problem!

54:00.997 --> 54:03.366
All of this started
when you came
to the drop zone!

54:03.466 --> 54:04.434
You show up.

54:04.533 --> 54:05.768
First Payson disappears,

54:05.869 --> 54:07.237
Evan has a heart attack,

54:07.337 --> 54:09.772
Greg goes home with you
and somehow manages to break

54:09.873 --> 54:12.442
every bone in his body
in the middle of the night.

54:12.541 --> 54:15.577
I don't know what your deal is,
but there is something
very wrong with you.

54:15.677 --> 54:18.214
Come on, Lisa.
Just take it easy.

54:18.314 --> 54:20.450
Take it easy?
Fuck easy!

54:20.549 --> 54:23.286
How do you explain it,
Wade?

54:23.386 --> 54:24.521
I don't know!

54:27.190 --> 54:28.291
El Niño?

54:31.727 --> 54:34.030
Stay the hell away from me.

54:36.066 --> 54:37.566
Let's go, Wade.

54:45.241 --> 54:46.910
Are you fucking serious?

54:47.010 --> 54:48.812
She's not the bad guy
here, Lisa.

54:51.548 --> 54:54.317
Keep telling
yourself that.

55:02.724 --> 55:03.993
You okay?

55:05.028 --> 55:07.230
I need to get the hell
out of this house.

55:20.543 --> 55:21.845
What's up, guys?

55:22.678 --> 55:25.647
What are you
doing here? Two.

55:25.747 --> 55:28.852
What else are you gonna do
when no one wants to jump?

55:28.952 --> 55:30.920
Guess we're
in the right place, then.

55:35.791 --> 55:38.027
Sarah, you okay?

55:38.895 --> 55:41.131
Dude, Lisa went off on her.

55:41.564 --> 55:42.866
Told her
that she was a jinx,

55:43.133 --> 55:45.235
said that everything
that happened was her fault.

55:46.603 --> 55:47.669
That's stupid.

55:47.769 --> 55:48.972
I know, right?
That's what I told her.

55:50.940 --> 55:53.543
- It's not you, Sarah.
- Mm-mm.

55:53.642 --> 55:55.044
It's the Hex.

55:55.145 --> 55:57.847
Oh, come on, Andy!

55:57.947 --> 55:59.315
Not this horseshit again.

55:59.415 --> 56:00.416
- Hey!
- No.

56:00.517 --> 56:03.086
I can't name
one team, not one,

56:03.186 --> 56:05.822
that's done it
and is still alive.

56:05.922 --> 56:07.490
And I've been
here a while.

56:07.590 --> 56:10.260
I mean, heck, Kris,
you've been here
longer than I have.

56:10.360 --> 56:11.928
Can you?

56:13.263 --> 56:14.730
Nope.

56:16.332 --> 56:20.136
Okay, look, I'm-I'm
as superstitious
as anyone.

56:20.236 --> 56:21.905
I touch the wing
of the plane before I get in,

56:22.005 --> 56:24.274
I-I-I don't take
pictures before I jump,

56:24.374 --> 56:27.310
but I don't believe
in any stupid Hex curse.
Come on!

56:28.645 --> 56:32.348
That's what Payson said
when I asked him not to do it.

56:32.448 --> 56:34.017
He laughed at me.

56:35.251 --> 56:38.354
He said, "Don't put
that bad juju
in people's heads."

56:39.989 --> 56:41.891
He said you'd
mess up the jump.

56:43.426 --> 56:44.994
So, I kept my mouth shut.

56:46.029 --> 56:48.097
You could have said
something.

56:49.265 --> 56:50.433
Would you have listened?

56:52.969 --> 56:54.470
That's the problem
with you guys.

56:54.571 --> 56:58.274
I mean, just the idea
of death makes things
more enticing.

56:58.374 --> 56:59.943
Oh, come on, Andy!

57:00.043 --> 57:02.412
It sounds like
total bullshit to me.

57:03.613 --> 57:05.982
Where--
where are you going?

57:06.082 --> 57:09.018
To find out
if we're cursed or not.
Are you coming?

57:27.170 --> 57:29.239
When you said
that we were gonna find
some spiritual help,

57:29.339 --> 57:32.008
I thought you meant
hire an exorcist or something.

57:32.108 --> 57:34.310
Why? It's not like
we're being possessed.

57:35.845 --> 57:37.313
Okay, that's a good point.

57:39.916 --> 57:43.186
I'm not very flexible.
Just FYI.

57:44.454 --> 57:45.989
Thanks, Dianne.

57:47.290 --> 57:49.359
Sarah?

57:52.095 --> 57:53.997
Are you okay?
What's going on?

57:54.097 --> 57:56.866
Hi, Mom. This is
my friend, Wade.

57:57.834 --> 57:59.636
- Hmm.
- You got a minute?

58:00.270 --> 58:03.039
Um... of course.
You guys come on back.

58:07.076 --> 58:09.212
What did the police say?

58:10.013 --> 58:12.582
Nothing.
Guy's worthless.

58:12.682 --> 58:15.952
I think I'm
their prime suspect,
if that tells you anything.

58:18.621 --> 58:20.423
We need some help, Mom.

58:21.457 --> 58:25.962
Well, I'm not sure
I can be much help, but...

58:28.898 --> 58:31.668
let's start by centering
ourselves.

58:33.803 --> 58:35.104
Find a comfortable
seated position,

58:35.204 --> 58:37.206
something you can hold
for a while.

58:43.980 --> 58:46.182
You can lie down,
if that's easier.

58:47.684 --> 58:50.286
Ah! This is good.

58:50.386 --> 58:54.023
Close your eyes
and try to relax,

58:54.123 --> 58:57.660
- breathing easily
and deeply...

58:57.760 --> 59:02.365
repeating the Sanskrit mantra
<i>So Hum</i> in your mind.

59:03.933 --> 59:09.038
<i>So</i> on the inhale,
<i>Hum </i> on the exhale.

59:10.773 --> 59:13.443
<i>So... hum.</i>

59:22.085 --> 59:23.653
Yo, Andy!

59:23.753 --> 59:26.289
Ingrid wants
to show you something!

59:29.192 --> 59:31.194
What the fuck was that?

59:31.294 --> 59:32.362
Everybody out!

59:32.462 --> 59:33.463
Open the door!

59:35.331 --> 59:37.633
What happened?
Did I pass out?

59:38.836 --> 59:42.271
You didn't just pass out.
You had like a full-on seizure.

59:45.408 --> 59:46.476
What did you see?

59:49.879 --> 59:51.948
It was the day
we did the Hex.

59:52.048 --> 59:54.150
The last time
we saw Payson.

59:55.718 --> 59:57.520
Only it was different.

59:58.421 --> 1:00:01.124
Something went wrong
with the plane.

1:00:02.826 --> 1:00:05.128
Mom? What's wrong?
What is it?

1:00:07.530 --> 1:00:08.731
It's, uh...

1:00:08.832 --> 1:00:12.135
it's just been a long time
since I've heard that name.

1:00:13.871 --> 1:00:15.438
What name?

1:00:16.973 --> 1:00:18.408
The Hex.

1:00:19.475 --> 1:00:21.477
Wait, why does your mom
know the Hex?

1:00:21.711 --> 1:00:24.247
- How do you know the Hex?
- Mom?

1:00:27.316 --> 1:00:29.887
After your father died,
people watched the video
of his death

1:00:29.986 --> 1:00:32.488
over and over again
to see what went wrong.

1:00:34.323 --> 1:00:36.426
But it was
just an accident.

1:00:37.560 --> 1:00:39.362
It wasn't anyone's fault.

1:00:40.396 --> 1:00:42.765
Sarah, if she's saying
that your dad died
doing the Hex,

1:00:42.866 --> 1:00:43.966
I'm gonna flip my shit!

1:00:44.066 --> 1:00:46.002
What I'm saying...

1:00:46.102 --> 1:00:48.538
is it wasn't always
called the Hex.

1:00:49.873 --> 1:00:52.175
Your father never
called it the Hex.

1:00:53.242 --> 1:00:57.046
They only started
calling it that
after the other deaths.

1:00:57.146 --> 1:00:59.282
The unexplained ones.

1:01:01.484 --> 1:01:03.119
Unexplained deaths?

1:01:03.219 --> 1:01:05.421
All but one
of your father's team.

1:01:06.556 --> 1:01:09.559
And the other teams
stupid enough to try it.

1:01:10.660 --> 1:01:12.695
They didn't all
necessarily die
on a skydive,

1:01:12.796 --> 1:01:14.664
but it never ended well.

1:01:16.165 --> 1:01:17.767
Eventually,
it just became...

1:01:18.836 --> 1:01:22.305
the thing that people
talked about
around a bonfire.

1:01:22.405 --> 1:01:25.141
Why didn't you ever
tell me any of this?

1:01:25.241 --> 1:01:26.309
You had a hard enough time

1:01:26.409 --> 1:01:28.077
dealing
with your father's death.

1:01:29.345 --> 1:01:31.481
I thought I was
protecting you.

1:01:37.086 --> 1:01:38.488
Take this.

1:01:38.588 --> 1:01:41.724
Why? To meditate?

1:01:42.525 --> 1:01:45.061
Just tell me what the hell
we're supposed to do now.

1:01:46.529 --> 1:01:48.097
I wish I could.

1:01:58.374 --> 1:01:59.475
So?

1:02:01.377 --> 1:02:03.446
So what?

1:02:03.546 --> 1:02:05.581
So, what do you think?

1:02:07.383 --> 1:02:10.286
Are you sure that your mom's
not some New Age weirdo?

1:02:10.954 --> 1:02:13.289
Talking about things
from like ten years ago?

1:02:14.357 --> 1:02:16.325
That can't be
what's happening.

1:02:16.425 --> 1:02:18.694
Do you really believe that?

1:02:20.530 --> 1:02:23.099
Next time, we go
to the exorcist.

1:02:35.311 --> 1:02:39.215
Bet those solo skydives
look really good
right about now.

1:02:41.384 --> 1:02:42.318
Nah.

1:02:44.855 --> 1:02:47.456
Jumping alone
all those years...

1:02:49.058 --> 1:02:50.760
I was missing out.

1:02:54.430 --> 1:02:56.566
I'm glad
we're in this together.

1:02:58.301 --> 1:03:00.770
Fuckin' A.
Can't make it alone.

1:03:06.509 --> 1:03:09.312
I wish Lisa
were here right now.

1:03:09.412 --> 1:03:12.315
Why, so she could knock
some teeth out this time?

1:03:12.415 --> 1:03:15.819
No, I just feel--
I feel bad.

1:03:16.887 --> 1:03:18.521
She's part of the team.

1:03:19.823 --> 1:03:21.691
You know, whatever's
left of it.

1:03:24.895 --> 1:03:28.364
I just feel like we should
stick together, you know?

1:03:47.416 --> 1:03:49.251
I told you
not to come near me.

1:03:49.352 --> 1:03:51.487
Look, we wanted
to warn you.

1:03:52.154 --> 1:03:53.589
About what?

1:03:54.523 --> 1:03:56.392
You-you might need this.

1:03:56.827 --> 1:04:01.230
They-they are beads,
you know? Like beads.

1:04:03.100 --> 1:04:07.336
I think the plane
was supposed to crash
the day we did the Hex.

1:04:08.771 --> 1:04:10.306
Is that right?

1:04:12.375 --> 1:04:16.412
And maybe
it was supposed to crash
because we did the Hex.

1:04:16.980 --> 1:04:18.614
So, you're basing this

1:04:18.714 --> 1:04:21.283
on a vision you had
while doing yoga?

1:04:22.819 --> 1:04:24.720
- Yeah.
- Wow.

1:04:24.955 --> 1:04:26.355
And you, Wade?

1:04:27.057 --> 1:04:28.892
I was just
kinda lyin' there.

1:04:28.992 --> 1:04:30.794
Okay.

1:04:30.894 --> 1:04:34.031
Well, forgive me
if I don't take it
all that seriously.

1:04:34.597 --> 1:04:37.767
Nothing strange
has happened to you, Lisa,

1:04:37.868 --> 1:04:39.602
since Payson disappeared?

1:04:41.938 --> 1:04:43.205
Shit! Are you okay?

1:04:45.042 --> 1:04:46.308
I'm fine.

1:04:46.409 --> 1:04:48.310
Listen, I've heard enough.

1:04:48.411 --> 1:04:51.480
So, thanks for checking in,
but I'm good.
You should go.

1:04:53.083 --> 1:04:54.617
Lisa, come with us.

1:04:54.717 --> 1:04:56.185
You shouldn't have
to do this by yourself.

1:04:56.285 --> 1:04:57.753
None of us
should be alone.

1:04:57.854 --> 1:05:02.025
All I am doing is looking
for a little peace and quiet.

1:05:02.125 --> 1:05:03.526
Please.

1:05:31.654 --> 1:05:33.656
<i>Lisa...</i>

1:05:36.459 --> 1:05:40.429
<i>Lisa... Now you... Lisa...</i>

1:05:47.570 --> 1:05:50.539
<i>Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa...</i>

1:05:52.742 --> 1:05:54.510
Leave me alone!

1:06:03.719 --> 1:06:06.223
There's definitely something
she's not telling us.

1:06:12.929 --> 1:06:14.263
So now what?

1:06:15.331 --> 1:06:16.499
Wade.

1:06:53.270 --> 1:06:54.703
How's our favorite Sheriff?

1:06:56.006 --> 1:06:58.809
He says I'm a person
of interest
in an ongoing case,

1:06:58.909 --> 1:07:01.544
and now I'm not supposed
to leave town.

1:07:03.612 --> 1:07:05.447
What the fuck
are we gonna do, Wade?

1:07:05.548 --> 1:07:08.251
Look, I knew that your turn
in there was gonna take
longer than mine,

1:07:08.350 --> 1:07:10.854
and so I found myself
back at the bar.

1:07:10.954 --> 1:07:12.923
Well, have you ever looked
at any of the old pictures

1:07:13.023 --> 1:07:14.456
hanging on the wall in there?

1:07:15.357 --> 1:07:16.960
Yeah, yeah,
I guess. Why?

1:07:17.060 --> 1:07:20.063
Well, I don't know,
I never really paid
attention until today.

1:07:22.598 --> 1:07:24.935
I found this hanging
on the wall in there.

1:07:25.035 --> 1:07:27.636
- You stole a picture
off the wall?
- Look at it.

1:07:28.805 --> 1:07:30.941
That's your dad's
old team, isn't it?

1:07:33.109 --> 1:07:34.911
Does anybody
look familiar?

1:07:39.282 --> 1:07:40.616
Yeah.

1:08:19.488 --> 1:08:21.024
What're you doing here?

1:08:22.092 --> 1:08:23.759
What's-what--
what's that for?

1:08:25.262 --> 1:08:28.731
Gophers and other pests.

1:08:31.034 --> 1:08:33.502
Now, piss off.

1:08:34.304 --> 1:08:35.704
I don't take visitors.

1:08:35.805 --> 1:08:38.008
We want to ask you
about the Hex.

1:08:41.344 --> 1:08:42.178
Why me?

1:08:43.646 --> 1:08:45.849
Because we know
you did it, too.

1:08:48.852 --> 1:08:49.986
All right, then.

1:08:52.956 --> 1:08:54.024
Come on.

1:08:57.160 --> 1:08:58.427
Sit.

1:09:04.367 --> 1:09:06.136
I'm more of a beer guy.

1:09:07.137 --> 1:09:08.204
Suit yourself.

1:09:12.641 --> 1:09:15.912
You survived
the Hex. How?

1:09:17.546 --> 1:09:19.015
You knew
that we were gonna do it.

1:09:19.115 --> 1:09:22.518
Why didn't you warn us,
or-or try to stop us?

1:09:26.289 --> 1:09:28.158
Both good questions.

1:09:29.692 --> 1:09:31.861
I ever tell you
about my first jump?

1:09:32.796 --> 1:09:35.832
You've never said
more than two words
to any of us.

1:09:39.102 --> 1:09:40.703
I was as good as dead...

1:09:41.603 --> 1:09:43.974
the first time
I jumped out of an airplane.

1:09:45.442 --> 1:09:48.178
All I had to do
to live again was pull.

1:09:49.079 --> 1:09:51.147
That's intoxicating.

1:09:51.948 --> 1:09:54.017
I went right back up again...

1:09:55.584 --> 1:09:57.486
and it just wasn't
the same.

1:09:59.422 --> 1:10:00.689
Get to your point.

1:10:03.426 --> 1:10:05.829
To even come close
to that feeling again,

1:10:06.528 --> 1:10:09.799
I had to push my limits
further and further.

1:10:11.935 --> 1:10:13.003
Didn't help
that I wasn't born

1:10:13.103 --> 1:10:15.271
with any natural talent
for anything.

1:10:17.173 --> 1:10:19.976
Nah. My luck was going
to run out eventually.

1:10:21.378 --> 1:10:22.812
I needed help.

1:10:24.247 --> 1:10:26.816
Help? From who?

1:10:27.783 --> 1:10:32.088
I prayed to God,
the Devil.

1:10:34.924 --> 1:10:38.128
Out loud, hell,
even in my dreams.

1:10:40.662 --> 1:10:42.499
In the end,

1:10:42.598 --> 1:10:45.001
I think it was my soul
that conjured the demon.

1:10:47.603 --> 1:10:49.973
You, just like that,
you conjured a demon?

1:10:50.340 --> 1:10:52.708
Not "just like that"!

1:10:56.479 --> 1:11:00.316
Lanithro,
the demon of the air,

1:11:01.484 --> 1:11:03.053
showed me
how we could use the Hex

1:11:03.153 --> 1:11:04.720
to take what we wanted.

1:11:07.057 --> 1:11:09.893
You want to know
how I survived the Hex?

1:11:12.462 --> 1:11:14.164
I created it.

1:11:15.298 --> 1:11:19.235
You... made the Hex?

1:11:19.701 --> 1:11:22.738
Just imagine
what it feels like to know

1:11:22.839 --> 1:11:25.607
that you've got
lives to spare.

1:11:26.910 --> 1:11:31.881
I could... take any chance
I wanted, try anything...

1:11:32.648 --> 1:11:34.918
consequences be damned.

1:11:35.919 --> 1:11:37.821
I was given freedom...

1:11:38.620 --> 1:11:40.656
freedom from death itself.

1:11:42.724 --> 1:11:45.161
Because the lives of anyone
who tries the Hex...

1:11:46.863 --> 1:11:48.764
then belong to you.

1:11:51.468 --> 1:11:52.502
They're the sacrifice.

1:11:52.601 --> 1:11:54.037
More.

1:11:55.505 --> 1:11:59.275
I took more than their lives.
I-I took their abilities.

1:12:00.910 --> 1:12:03.012
Lanithro took their souls.

1:12:04.047 --> 1:12:08.451
It's a game he created
and never grew tired of.

1:12:08.551 --> 1:12:10.220
You lying son-of-a-bitch!

1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:11.620
Wade!

1:12:11.720 --> 1:12:14.057
What the fuck
did you really do?

1:12:14.157 --> 1:12:15.258
Wade! Enough!

1:12:15.358 --> 1:12:17.227
Get off of him!

1:12:26.069 --> 1:12:28.404
It was only ever supposed
to be one jump.

1:12:30.140 --> 1:12:32.275
And then,
the rumors got started.

1:12:33.543 --> 1:12:35.812
Human nature
was impossible to control.

1:12:36.913 --> 1:12:39.149
People just had to see
for themselves.

1:12:39.249 --> 1:12:42.152
I couldn't warn them,
and I couldn't warn you.

1:12:44.521 --> 1:12:45.754
It became known as the Hex.

1:12:45.955 --> 1:12:48.757
If that were true,
then you would be
immortal by now.

1:12:49.459 --> 1:12:52.061
What are you still doing
in this busted-ass trailer?

1:12:53.229 --> 1:12:54.931
That's not how it works.

1:12:56.032 --> 1:12:58.902
I mean, do I look like someone
who's gonna live forever?

1:13:00.803 --> 1:13:04.874
All those lives
are just second chances.

1:13:06.876 --> 1:13:08.845
And I wasted all of them.

1:13:10.547 --> 1:13:12.781
All I had left was my own.

1:13:14.184 --> 1:13:18.454
Once that happened,
I quit skydiving altogether.

1:13:20.023 --> 1:13:22.225
So, there's no way
to stop it?

1:13:22.325 --> 1:13:24.294
How many deaths are you
responsible for?

1:13:29.032 --> 1:13:30.967
Are you responsible
for my father?

1:13:31.868 --> 1:13:32.969
Sarah, get out of the way.

1:13:33.069 --> 1:13:34.337
Wade, what are you doing?

1:13:34.437 --> 1:13:36.005
Do you believe him?

1:13:38.474 --> 1:13:40.709
I don't know
what's happening,
but I know one thing.

1:13:40.810 --> 1:13:41.911
I take him out,
and I end it.

1:13:42.011 --> 1:13:43.880
You don't know that!

1:13:43.980 --> 1:13:45.048
What do you think, Kris?

1:13:45.148 --> 1:13:46.482
Think this'll end it?

1:13:47.550 --> 1:13:49.285
Please, Wade. Don't.

1:13:50.353 --> 1:13:51.321
No, no, no.

1:13:52.255 --> 1:13:53.289
No, let him.

1:13:53.389 --> 1:13:54.457
I want this.

1:13:55.258 --> 1:13:57.260
I want this to end.

1:13:58.561 --> 1:14:00.029
Wait.

1:14:02.899 --> 1:14:04.901
You never
answered my question.

1:14:07.070 --> 1:14:09.205
Your father was
a good man, Sarah.

1:14:09.806 --> 1:14:11.608
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

1:14:11.708 --> 1:14:12.909
- I'm sorry.
- No.

1:14:13.009 --> 1:14:15.044
You motherfucker.

1:14:29.659 --> 1:14:31.060
Sarah...

1:14:32.161 --> 1:14:33.096
Sarah.

1:14:33.563 --> 1:14:35.064
Open the door.

1:14:36.232 --> 1:14:37.100
What?

1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:39.302
Open the door!

1:14:45.508 --> 1:14:49.012
Sarah, where were you?

1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:52.215
I don't know.

1:14:55.818 --> 1:14:59.188
Uh... I was on the plane.

1:14:59.689 --> 1:15:01.190
Before you did the Hex?

1:15:01.658 --> 1:15:04.494
Yeah, I think so.

1:15:07.130 --> 1:15:10.199
We were supposed to crash,
weren't we?

1:15:11.134 --> 1:15:13.503
The plane wasn't
supposed to crash.

1:15:15.004 --> 1:15:18.241
The plane is crashing.
Right now.

1:15:20.410 --> 1:15:21.811
What?

1:15:21.911 --> 1:15:23.780
This is how it happens.

1:15:23.880 --> 1:15:25.915
This is how the Hex works.

1:15:26.849 --> 1:15:29.252
You are not
where you think you are

1:15:29.352 --> 1:15:31.954
or even <i>when</i> you think
you are.

1:15:32.422 --> 1:15:34.190
You're occupying
the space and time

1:15:34.290 --> 1:15:38.361
between when you know
you're going to die
and when you die.

1:15:38.461 --> 1:15:42.098
And that space and time
can stretch out further
than you can imagine.

1:15:44.067 --> 1:15:45.501
That's impossible.

1:15:46.002 --> 1:15:47.236
You will continue to slip

1:15:47.337 --> 1:15:51.174
between this waking nightmare
and reality

1:15:51.507 --> 1:15:53.142
until you're dead.

1:15:58.147 --> 1:16:00.216
You're running out of time,

1:16:00.483 --> 1:16:02.885
but there is a way
if you'll let me help you.

1:16:02.985 --> 1:16:04.822
That's impossible.

1:16:05.088 --> 1:16:07.256
Do you have the altimeter?

1:16:08.958 --> 1:16:12.295
Payson's altimeter,
do you have it?

1:16:33.416 --> 1:16:34.283
Let's go!

1:16:38.588 --> 1:16:39.956
Fuck, his seatbelt!

1:16:45.595 --> 1:16:47.296
There's no time! Let's go!

1:16:47.397 --> 1:16:48.664
Evan, you're next!

1:17:02.678 --> 1:17:03.646
Andy!

1:17:03.746 --> 1:17:04.981
Thank God
you're still here.

1:17:05.081 --> 1:17:08.251
Yeah, I'm here. I'm
just puttin' away the plane.

1:17:08.351 --> 1:17:11.587
Holy Jesus, what happened?
Is that blood?

1:17:11.687 --> 1:17:13.322
Whoa! Whoa!

1:17:15.525 --> 1:17:18.094
What's the matter with you?
Let's go, let's go!

1:17:27.905 --> 1:17:29.539
Lost the right engine!

1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:32.375
We're losing altitude fast!

1:17:32.475 --> 1:17:34.343
We're super low!
Pull right away, guys!

1:17:40.818 --> 1:17:44.888
Hey. Hey,
you're all right.

1:17:44.987 --> 1:17:47.557
Just kinda faded
on me there
for a second.

1:17:48.124 --> 1:17:51.160
You were right
about the Hex.

1:17:51.260 --> 1:17:53.596
- We never should
have tried it.
- What?

1:17:54.197 --> 1:17:55.998
Is that what this
is all about?

1:17:56.299 --> 1:17:59.702
Andy, please.
I have to go now.

1:17:59.969 --> 1:18:01.370
I have to jump.

1:18:03.005 --> 1:18:05.208
It's the only way.

1:18:08.144 --> 1:18:10.179
I hope you know
what you're doin'.

1:18:51.587 --> 1:18:53.723
Would you all
kindly get the fuck
out of my plane?

1:18:53.824 --> 1:18:55.558
Lisa, now you!

1:19:00.196 --> 1:19:02.164
Fuck!

1:19:37.567 --> 1:19:39.168
Sarah, run.

1:19:57.955 --> 1:19:59.288
Oh, my God.

1:20:04.061 --> 1:20:05.194
No!

1:20:06.797 --> 1:20:08.397
Come on!

1:20:09.765 --> 1:20:11.567
Come on.

1:20:58.882 --> 1:20:59.950
You made it.

1:21:00.449 --> 1:21:04.821
You have no idea.
You have no fucking idea!

1:21:04.921 --> 1:21:06.756
What the fuck
is happening?

1:21:09.425 --> 1:21:10.793
You still don't know?

1:21:16.066 --> 1:21:17.834
So what's the Hex?

1:21:26.910 --> 1:21:28.411
We've all
heard the stories.

1:21:38.454 --> 1:21:41.590
A cursed skydive?
Are you kidding me?

1:21:45.494 --> 1:21:48.531
That seems like a bad idea,
but what do I know?

1:21:50.633 --> 1:21:53.469
But I don't believe
in any stupid Hex curse.
Come on.

1:22:01.744 --> 1:22:04.346
<i>You are not</i>
<i>where you think you are.</i>

1:22:08.885 --> 1:22:13.489
<i>You will continue to slip</i>
<i>between this waking</i>
<i>nightmare...</i>

1:22:13.589 --> 1:22:15.458
<i>...and reality...</i>

1:22:17.593 --> 1:22:19.595
<i>...until you're dead.</i>

1:22:52.195 --> 1:22:53.562
What'd you tell her?

1:22:53.662 --> 1:22:55.932
I told her
if she wanted to survive,

1:22:56.398 --> 1:22:58.768
she had to jump
with your altimeter.

1:23:02.338 --> 1:23:05.541
Gullible.
Just like her dad.

1:23:08.044 --> 1:23:09.311
And this thing's
not a toy.

1:23:10.180 --> 1:23:13.049
How else are you gonna know
how many lives
you're workin' with?

1:23:16.887 --> 1:23:20.556
That look on her face
was priceless, though.

1:23:21.390 --> 1:23:23.894
You are one sadistic bastard,
do you know that?

1:23:24.393 --> 1:23:26.395
You're definitely
goin' to hell.

1:23:30.834 --> 1:23:32.969
And maybe
I can show you around.

1:23:33.536 --> 1:23:35.771
Not anytime soon, Lanithro.
