JANICE: Wow, great description,
guys. Dispatch out. Idiots.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.637
[grunts]

09:13.727 --> 09:15.293
Hello?

09:17.861 --> 09:19.994
Hello?

09:20.037 --> 09:23.824
Anybody here?

09:23.867 --> 09:25.303
Oh, shit.

09:25.347 --> 09:28.437
Okay, just relax.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.874
My name is Marco.
I'm the new trainer.

09:30.918 --> 09:33.834
This is the challenger,
Señor Feathers.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.357
I took over
for Roberto.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.664
I was supposed to see Frank.
Are you Frank?

09:37.707 --> 09:40.536
Oh, shit, okay-- oh, fuck.
Okay, okay, okay.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.712
There's a password.
Okay, okay.

09:42.756 --> 09:47.456
The best season of
The Great British Bake Off

09:47.499 --> 09:50.459
is season 2.

09:50.502 --> 09:51.982
[sighs]

09:54.637 --> 09:58.380
That bird is
deceptively heavy. Wow.

09:58.423 --> 10:00.817
This place is great.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.863
[groans]

10:05.909 --> 10:08.738
Sorry we snuck up
on you like that.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.697
I like to get to the
place early, you know,

10:10.740 --> 10:12.960
so Señor Feathers can
get out, walk around,

10:13.003 --> 10:15.484
get the lay of the land,
get to know the ring.

10:15.527 --> 10:18.748
You know, cockfight, it's,
like, 90% intellectual.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.750
It's all psychology
for the bird.

10:20.794 --> 10:23.927
[rooster clucking softly]

10:23.971 --> 10:27.191
How long you been,
uh, doing cockfights?

10:28.976 --> 10:30.586
That's all right.
We can just sit here,

10:30.630 --> 10:33.502
be quiet,
I'm good with that.

10:33.545 --> 10:35.765
You know what I caught
the other day

10:35.809 --> 10:39.203
on cable? Jumanji.The original.

10:39.247 --> 10:42.554
Not Jumanjifrom now
with, you know...

10:45.470 --> 10:46.950
What's the
guy's name?

10:46.994 --> 10:50.737
Wrestler who's
now in movies?

10:54.392 --> 10:56.090
Oh, here he is,
here he is, here he is.Okay.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.396
Haldeman is about to give his
statement. You want to listen?

10:58.440 --> 10:59.920
CULLEN: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Turn it up, turn it up.

10:59.963 --> 11:02.009
I got 50 bucks
on the prison pool.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.445
Hm.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.926
HALDEMAN: I want to start
by saying that, uh,

11:05.969 --> 11:07.797
these corruption
stories are true.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.974
At the time, I said to myself
that what I did was okay.

11:11.018 --> 11:13.803
Oh, man,
that sucks, man.
Yeah.

11:13.847 --> 11:16.284
Haldeman was our shortstop
on the softball team.

11:16.327 --> 11:17.938
He had the mitt
of an angel.

11:17.981 --> 11:18.982
Yeah, that's what's
bad about this.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.636
Your police
softball team

11:20.680 --> 11:22.203
is down a shortstop,
and by the way,

11:22.246 --> 11:23.465
that's half your softball team

11:23.508 --> 11:24.727
has gone down
for corruption now.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.816
Boy, would you calm down?

11:26.860 --> 11:28.426
You're, like, yelling
at me right now.

11:28.470 --> 11:29.689
Whatever.

11:29.732 --> 11:31.691
That's a predicament for them.

11:31.734 --> 11:32.996
And, uh,

11:33.040 --> 11:35.782
the power I had over
these junior officers...

11:35.825 --> 11:38.915
Where have I heard this before?

11:38.959 --> 11:41.744
Is this Louis C.K.'s
apology?
I'll check.

11:41.788 --> 11:44.660
...policing and doing
anything I want.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.271
HALDEMAN and TOLBECK:
I will now step back

11:47.315 --> 11:49.926
and take a long time to listen.

11:49.970 --> 11:50.971
Thank you.

11:51.014 --> 11:53.277
Yep, Louis C.K.,
word for word.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.279
Oh, my God.Mm, mm, mm.

11:55.323 --> 11:56.846
Of all the apologies,
why steal the one

11:56.890 --> 11:58.892
where the guy doesn't even say
the word "sorry"?

11:58.935 --> 12:00.458
REPORTER: That was Agent
Josh Haldeman's statement...

12:00.502 --> 12:05.159
No. Ugh, he was, like,
my favorite cop.

12:05.202 --> 12:07.161
Now I can't like him anymore.

12:07.204 --> 12:08.466
REPORTER: The disgraced
agent was sentenced

12:08.510 --> 12:10.555
to six years in prison.[both wince]

12:10.599 --> 12:12.819
Fucking six years? I had seven.
That's 50 bucks.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.777
Mm, that's a good thing.

12:14.821 --> 12:17.171
Car 27, any word
on the raid?

12:17.214 --> 12:19.390
FATIMA:
Nope. Not yet.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.001
Copy that.

12:21.044 --> 12:24.961
Man, my grandfather
flew B-29s over Japan.

12:25.005 --> 12:27.007
I'm sitting here
waiting for

12:27.050 --> 12:28.617
two fat birds
to peck each other.

12:28.660 --> 12:29.661
[chuckles]

12:29.705 --> 12:31.228
I'll tell you what,

12:31.272 --> 12:33.274
a fat bird would not survive
a round with these athletes.

12:33.317 --> 12:36.059
What, are you an expert
on cockfighting now?

12:36.103 --> 12:37.974
No, I'm not an
expert, but, uh,

12:38.018 --> 12:39.846
when I was a kid,
my uncle Lavester

12:39.889 --> 12:41.369
had fighting birds, okay?

12:41.412 --> 12:42.849
Hm.
They're very mean.

12:42.892 --> 12:44.241
They're very
mischievous, too.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.678
Hm.
Yeah, one of them
burned his house down.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.593
What?
Yeah.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.465
He had this rooster,
it was at his house,

12:50.508 --> 12:54.251
he left, came back,
house was burned down.

12:54.295 --> 12:56.993
And he said a rooster did that?

12:57.037 --> 12:59.517
A rooster burned down his house?

12:59.561 --> 13:01.868
Yeah... You know,
now that I say it out loud,

13:01.911 --> 13:03.913
it doesn't sound like
it could be true.
Mm.

13:08.178 --> 13:09.658
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.573
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
What is it?

13:11.616 --> 13:13.140
This pervert sent me
a screenshot

13:13.183 --> 13:14.924
of the video.
Oh, fuck, he's serious.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.186
Let me see it.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.797
No, Janice,
I don't know...
Please.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.624
I don't want you
to see me like this.

13:19.668 --> 13:23.237
Don't drag it out,
give it to me.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.805
[laughing]

13:25.848 --> 13:28.155
That's your pleasure face?
Oh, my God.

13:28.198 --> 13:29.852
You look like a dog
getting an injection.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.594
No one was ever
supposed to see this.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.683
It's remarkable.
You know, it reminds me,

13:34.726 --> 13:36.598
did you ever see that movie Silence of the Lambs

13:36.641 --> 13:38.034
when Agent Starling
goes to that storage unit

13:38.078 --> 13:40.689
and she see that head
in formaldehyde?

13:40.732 --> 13:41.864
Well, you look
like that,

13:41.908 --> 13:43.866
but with less lipstick.
[laughing]

13:43.910 --> 13:46.042
Thanks, Janice. No, come on.

13:46.086 --> 13:47.522
Oh, look it here,
he's only asking

13:47.565 --> 13:50.525
for 700 bucks. That's easy,
that's chump change.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.222
That's low?
Oh.

13:52.266 --> 13:54.094
He's got a Venmo account.
You got one of those?

13:54.137 --> 13:56.226
Yeah.
Perf.

13:56.270 --> 13:59.142
Write it down,
let me give you his name.Okay.

13:59.186 --> 14:01.318
Mm-hmm. It is

14:01.362 --> 14:03.103
"nosamlogboy69."

14:03.146 --> 14:05.279
Aw, shit.
Okay.

14:05.322 --> 14:06.541
[laughing]
What?

14:06.584 --> 14:08.108
What, what, what?

14:08.151 --> 14:09.849
It's Mason.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.025
It's Mason?

14:12.068 --> 14:13.504
Mason backwards,
"nosam."

14:13.548 --> 14:16.072
Like, the kids call him
"logboy" at school,

14:16.116 --> 14:18.292
and "69," I have
no idea what that is,

14:18.335 --> 14:22.209
but I should've known, it's got
his fingerprints all over this.

14:22.252 --> 14:24.254
Your son Mason has the video?Yeah.

14:24.298 --> 14:26.953
Can you believe it?Yes?

14:26.996 --> 14:29.651
I mean, where do they learn this
stuff? I got to give him credit.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.044
At least we
can end this.

14:31.087 --> 14:34.221
Do you want to call him?

14:34.264 --> 14:35.875
Me?

14:35.918 --> 14:37.137
Yeah.No. I'm not getting involved.

14:37.180 --> 14:38.138
This is your problem.

14:38.181 --> 14:40.140
Don't involve me.

14:40.183 --> 14:42.403
But you're his mother.

14:42.446 --> 14:44.448
I'm not that kind of mother.
I don't henpeck him.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.102
I don't still breastfeed him.

14:46.146 --> 14:48.583
I got him on a long leash.
We have separate lives.

14:48.626 --> 14:50.150
This is your
problem, baby.

14:50.193 --> 14:51.629
Okay.
Here.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.240
You call him, but when you do,

14:53.283 --> 14:55.285
tell him he owes me ten bucks.
He knows why.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.551
MARCO: And I mean,
you could clearly see,

15:00.595 --> 15:03.337
in the background,
one of the munchkins

15:03.380 --> 15:06.253
has hung himself.
I mean, that's cra-- Oh!

15:06.296 --> 15:08.342
Three Men and a Baby.Okay?
Do you know this one?

15:08.385 --> 15:10.257
So there is,
in one of the scenes,

15:10.300 --> 15:12.085
a ghost behind the curtains

15:12.128 --> 15:14.043
in the San Francisco
apartment, right?

15:14.087 --> 15:16.045
We caught it on film.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.351
Why aren't people
talking about this more?

15:17.394 --> 15:18.526
[sneezes]Why aren't we...

15:21.007 --> 15:22.791
Why... Why aren't we

15:22.834 --> 15:24.140
investigating?

15:24.184 --> 15:25.968
Why aren't we putting people
on the case,

15:26.012 --> 15:28.231
so that we can figure out
how many times

15:28.275 --> 15:29.711
we've captured--
Whoa!

15:29.754 --> 15:31.713
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Okay, okay, okay.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.280
You're a woman, okay.

15:33.323 --> 15:34.629
Is that gonna be
a fucking problem?
No!

15:34.672 --> 15:36.674
What? A problem? No.
Why would it be a problem?

15:36.718 --> 15:38.676
I love women.
Not only that,

15:38.720 --> 15:40.374
but I'm close with
the women in my family,

15:40.417 --> 15:42.158
my aunty,
I love my mom so much...

15:42.202 --> 15:43.899
I'm gonna fuck your mom,
you little pussy-ass bitch.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.119
What? Why?Listen to me,
you turd, my job here

15:46.162 --> 15:48.338
is easier if bitches like you
don't think of me as a woman.

15:48.382 --> 15:52.516
So you listen to me,
you racially ambiguous pirate.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.605
What does that even mean?You never saw
this, okay?

15:54.649 --> 15:56.303
My name is Frank.

15:56.346 --> 15:58.348
I don't get harassed, and I
don't get fucking disrespected,

15:58.392 --> 16:00.176
and if you have
a problem with that,

16:00.220 --> 16:03.919
then you can choke
on my big, black dick.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.226
Okay, all right, that--

16:06.269 --> 16:08.576
I got to say something.
If you're gonna try

16:08.619 --> 16:11.100
and pull off this whole
"I'm a guy" thing,

16:11.144 --> 16:13.015
don't sneeze
like a woodland nymph.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.148
You know, it's, frankly,
a dead giveaway.

16:15.191 --> 16:17.106
Also, that beard.

16:17.150 --> 16:20.240
I mean, it looks terrible.

16:20.283 --> 16:21.676
Are you fucking
kidding me?

16:21.719 --> 16:23.199
It looks like
a five-year-old did it.

16:23.243 --> 16:24.244
Your beard is insane.

16:24.287 --> 16:25.723
My beard is a real beard.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.377
It looks like you're
starting a church,

16:27.421 --> 16:29.814
but no one's gonna join 'cause
of your weird-ass fucking beard.

16:29.858 --> 16:31.251
Your beard looks like
just somebody threw

16:31.294 --> 16:32.600
a bunch of dirt on your face,

16:32.643 --> 16:34.428
and a bunch of it stuck
to this area

16:34.471 --> 16:36.038
'cause you were sweating
at the chin.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.648
All right.Okay, listen.

16:37.692 --> 16:39.955
I'm really just trying to
help you with what is obviously

16:39.999 --> 16:41.217
a very well-researched
character.

16:41.261 --> 16:43.480
Here, if you don't mind...What the fuck?

16:43.524 --> 16:45.265
[camera shutter clicks]Okay.

16:45.308 --> 16:46.831
You can't take my picture.I-I promise
I'll erase it.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.746
I literally am just trying
to illustrate a point.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.313
Look at this.

16:50.357 --> 16:52.359
Your eyes are so mean.

16:52.402 --> 16:54.317
The hood is doing great work.

16:54.361 --> 16:56.754
Your body language,

16:56.798 --> 16:58.321
everything is communicating
a threatening energy,

16:58.365 --> 16:59.714
which is great,

16:59.757 --> 17:02.064
but the beard, it honestly
just looks like

17:02.108 --> 17:03.979
someone threw dirt at you.Okay, good.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.329
Well, that's the look
I'm going for.
Great.

17:06.373 --> 17:10.290
But you know what?
The idea, the gall of you

17:10.333 --> 17:13.206
to question
my commitment to women

17:13.249 --> 17:15.512
is-is just over the line,
you know?

17:15.556 --> 17:18.341
I love women. I tried to go
to the last Women's March,

17:18.385 --> 17:21.344
but guess what?
They fucked it up

17:21.388 --> 17:24.217
because public transportation
was overrun, Uber surge pricing,

17:24.260 --> 17:26.567
they-- You-you guys
created an environment

17:26.610 --> 17:29.178
where you were
disincentivizing people,

17:29.222 --> 17:33.226
allies, from coming
and marching in solid--

17:33.269 --> 17:36.185
You know what? Here's how
you run a Women's March.[gun cocks]

17:36.229 --> 17:37.273
Wow.

17:42.322 --> 17:44.237
[humming]
Oh, shit,
look who it is.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.457
Ebenezer Splooge, once again.
Let's take him down.

17:47.501 --> 17:49.285
You ready? Come on.

17:57.685 --> 18:00.296
Herb? You know Old Man and
the Semen's real name?

18:00.340 --> 18:03.038
Yeah, his name
is Herb Fischer, okay?Jesus.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.954
Last time I gave him
his final warning, he...

18:05.997 --> 18:08.348
he looked me right
in the eye and he said,

18:08.391 --> 18:10.480
"I love you."
Okay.

18:10.524 --> 18:12.265
Okay. That's, uh, that's
very touching and romantic,

18:12.308 --> 18:14.528
but we're still gonna
take him down.

18:14.571 --> 18:16.356
Okay? Let's take him down.
We've got time. He takes long.No.

going to arrest Herb, okay?

bad karma, okay?

18:21.926 --> 18:23.363

just a veteran.

18:23.406 --> 18:25.147
He probably served
his country well

18:25.191 --> 18:26.366
and now he's just here

18:26.409 --> 18:28.498

his rocks off, okay?

18:28.542 --> 18:30.370

18:30.413 --> 18:32.502
