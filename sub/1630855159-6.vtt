02:05.959 --> 02:07.377
Hey there, William.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.378
Hi.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.424
Can you smile for Mama?

02:13.008 --> 02:14.468
<i>I love you so much, William.</i>

03:52.024 --> 03:53.775
<i>Please,
can someone tell us what's happened?</i>

03:53.775 --> 03:56.403
Have you found anyone?
We saw a gurney go inside.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.654
Gurney doesn't mean bad.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.406
- It could just be a precaution.
- Okay.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.036
- Okay, it's bad. Don't--
- Wha--

04:04.036 --> 04:07.623
- Don't look.
- Oh, my God. Mercer, who is it?

04:07.623 --> 04:10.417
I don't know. I just-- I don't wanna know.

04:15.214 --> 04:17.925
It's Bruno. It's Bruno.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.011
Is there anyone else inside?

04:22.513 --> 04:23.805
God, what is going on?

04:29.436 --> 04:31.563
You knew the victim? Augenblick?

04:33.315 --> 04:34.733
He was William's gallerist.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.818
And his dear friend.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.238
But as for William?

04:39.821 --> 04:41.406
He's not in there.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.201
I saw him earlier tonight.

04:44.201 --> 04:48.372
Witnesses say he was chased onto a ferry.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.499
Probably by the same people who did this.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.334
And? Is he okay?

04:52.334 --> 04:57.130
There's no clear evidence that he isn't,
but I lost him.

04:57.756 --> 05:00.092
So, you're pretty sure
this wasn't an accident?

05:03.387 --> 05:05.597
Why would anyone wanna kill Bruno?

05:05.597 --> 05:06.849
I don't think they did.

05:07.599 --> 05:10.477
They were trying to destroy the evidence
of whatever William was figuring out.

05:11.603 --> 05:12.604
Oh, my--

05:20.028 --> 05:21.530
Nicky. Come on.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.241
- Yo, let us in.
- We're here to help.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.034
Help with what?

05:27.953 --> 05:29.037
Don't worry about it.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.206
Hey, what's going on?

05:31.957 --> 05:33.125
I just said don't worry about it.

05:33.125 --> 05:36.170
No, I know what you said.
I wasn't asking you, I was asking her.

05:37.546 --> 05:38.547
It's Nicky.

05:39.590 --> 05:42.551
- He's fucked up about what happened t--
- Hey. That's enough, SG.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.763
Where you been, Charlie?

05:49.725 --> 05:50.726
Don't worry about it.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.197
I said, leave me alone!

06:04.573 --> 06:06.783
Oh, shit. Charlie.

06:08.243 --> 06:11.205
Charlie, the Prophet.

06:12.206 --> 06:15.083
You shall pass.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.337
Misery loves company, boy.

06:19.671 --> 06:20.839
No. No, thanks.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.717
Are you all right?

06:25.177 --> 06:26.178
How can I be?

06:28.096 --> 06:31.350
The demon's made me into a fucking devil.

06:32.643 --> 06:33.852
Maybe you always were one.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.235
I know about you and Sam.

06:44.613 --> 06:46.240
You found the photos?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.702
I wasn't expecting that.

06:52.788 --> 06:55.207
Little man's growing up.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.670
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, kid.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.673
I'm sorry. What can I say, you know?

07:05.133 --> 07:08.720
Girls dig musicians. Even the smart ones.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.890
Did you have feelings for her?

07:13.809 --> 07:16.979
Did you-- Do you love her?

07:21.900 --> 07:22.901
Yeah.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.446
And...

07:29.449 --> 07:30.492
does she love you?

07:33.620 --> 07:34.621
I don't know.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.375
Maybe she did for a little while.

07:40.085 --> 07:43.255
Why? Why only for a while?

07:43.255 --> 07:47.843
See, if you found the photos,
you already know. Right?

07:54.224 --> 07:59.354
It was an accident, but it broke her.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.774
It broke us.

08:03.692 --> 08:08.322
I made her question... everything.

08:08.322 --> 08:11.450
How am I supposed to
just forget what happened?

08:12.117 --> 08:14.203
Hey, hey. Hey, Sammy.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.041
Sammy. Our hearts are pure.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.543
Please hold onto that.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.254
Hold onto that.

08:27.341 --> 08:28.884
Know we will make--

08:29.676 --> 08:33.096
- We'll do something to make it right.
- No, no. Nothing--

08:33.096 --> 08:35.140
- Nothing can make this right!
- Hey, come on. S--

08:35.140 --> 08:40.312
Nicky, it's all so fucked.
Everything is so fucked!

08:44.274 --> 08:46.777
<i>She lost faith, Prophet.</i>

08:47.569 --> 08:48.904
Now I have too.

08:54.243 --> 08:57.204
Don't-- Charlie, absolve me.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.457
Absolve me, Charlie.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.626
I need absolution.

09:04.253 --> 09:05.254
Man.

09:07.339 --> 09:08.924
What you need is to sleep it off.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.558
Amory. What a surprise.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.142
A not unpleasant one, I hope.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.604
I do apologize
for dropping by unannounced,

09:22.604 --> 09:24.356
but I was worried about you.

09:25.357 --> 09:29.027
And that was before
I saw your new fixer-upper.

09:30.070 --> 09:34.366
Listen, as pressing as Daddy's case is,
right now is not a good time.

09:34.867 --> 09:37.077
It seems like bad times
is all you're having lately.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.830
That's why I'm here.
You must be overwhelmed.

09:39.830 --> 09:43.709
The sordid business with Keith,
your father's health, and seeing William.

09:43.709 --> 09:45.919
You never really said how that went.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.337
It was fine.

09:48.672 --> 09:51.967
There was a fire at William's studio.

09:51.967 --> 09:55.304
My God. And William?

09:55.888 --> 09:56.847
He wasn't there.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.267
But William's friend, Bruno, was.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.144
He's dead.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.605
William is missing.

10:05.981 --> 10:08.942
- That's awful.
- Some men chased William onto a ferry.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.361
The police think
they may have started the fire,

10:11.361 --> 10:13.739
but Mercer's apartment isn't safe.

10:14.907 --> 10:16.658
- And he came to you?
- Yeah.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.619
When I heard the news, I invited him in.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.495
Well, I hope you'll do the same for me.

10:25.250 --> 10:29.463
I never got to know Bruno,
but I know how much he meant to William.

10:30.756 --> 10:32.049
And now he's gone.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.177
- And William--
- About William,

10:35.177 --> 10:38.722
these thugs that were chasing him,
what do the police know about them?

10:38.722 --> 10:41.016
Names, faces, are they still at large?

10:41.016 --> 10:44.478
Why? You thinking of becoming a vigilante?

10:45.270 --> 10:46.396
The masked dandy?

10:48.065 --> 10:50.400
Gallows humor,
very important in trying times.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.529
But I am connected
to those who could help.

10:53.529 --> 10:58.283
The police, the coast guard,
search and rescue, search and recovery--

10:58.283 --> 11:00.744
We are not looking for a body.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.705
William is going to turn up,
and he is going to be okay.

11:03.705 --> 11:07.376
Mr. Goodman,
if only wishes could make it so.

11:07.376 --> 11:09.795
Wow, I wish you would just leave.

11:09.795 --> 11:10.879
Granted.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.924
Here. Amory, it's been a night.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.844
Thank you for making the trip out here.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.346
If we hear anything, we'll let you know.

11:20.556 --> 11:22.850
I do hope you get some rest, Mr. Goodman.

11:23.433 --> 11:27.104
With the way things are going,
who knows what could happen next?

11:29.731 --> 11:31.984
Reegs, I'll let myself out.

11:57.301 --> 12:01.221
<i>Yo, it's Nicky.
Let's be honest, I'm never checking this.</i>

12:01.221 --> 12:02.848
<i>The mailbox is full and c--</i>

12:02.848 --> 12:06.185
Goddamn it, you motherfucker!

12:06.185 --> 12:10.355
God! You killed someone else,
and William might still be alive!

12:10.355 --> 12:13.483
Goddamn, motherfucker!

12:13.984 --> 12:15.360
Ruin my fucking life!

12:20.240 --> 12:21.241
Drive on.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.585
What the hell happened that night?

14:24.865 --> 14:27.117
Mr. Yeung? I hope I'm not interrupting.

14:27.618 --> 14:28.827
No, not at all.

14:28.827 --> 14:31.955
Do whatever poking and prodding
you need to do. I can step out.

14:31.955 --> 14:35.042
I'm actually not here to check up on Sam.
I wanted to talk to you.

14:37.294 --> 14:40.756
Mr. Yeung, Sam isn't getting better.

14:43.300 --> 14:46.303
She's not getting worse either, right?
So, that's good.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.388
Not as good as we'd hoped.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.975
There's a trajectory
to an injury like this,

14:51.975 --> 14:53.810
where after a few weeks,

14:53.810 --> 14:57.940
once the brain has had a chance to heal,
it wakes itself up.

14:58.524 --> 14:59.900
We don't see that happening.

15:01.568 --> 15:02.402
Yet.

15:03.237 --> 15:04.321
Or maybe ever.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.198
What are you trying to say?

15:07.032 --> 15:09.535
You don't need to make a decision
today or tomorrow,

15:09.535 --> 15:13.205
but it's time to start
wrapping your head around the idea

15:13.205 --> 15:15.874
that you likely
do need to make a decision.

15:17.668 --> 15:18.669
I can't.

15:20.254 --> 15:21.713
It's not even a consideration.

15:22.381 --> 15:23.924
I'm never gonna give up.

15:25.259 --> 15:28.804
Mr. Yeung, in these situations,
we don't call it giving up.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.181
We call it letting go.

15:50.075 --> 15:53.662
That looks like a request for a warrant.
You get a break in the case?

15:53.662 --> 15:55.831
Maybe, if you back me on this.

15:59.668 --> 16:00.836
The day after the shooting,

16:00.836 --> 16:04.381
I solicited CCTV footage from
all the buildings across from the park.

16:04.381 --> 16:05.674
Got shot down by everyone.

16:06.258 --> 16:08.594
Fancy buildings, fancy people,
privacy concerns...

16:08.594 --> 16:09.678
Yeah, exactly.

16:09.678 --> 16:12.389
God forbid we catch a glimpse of
someone's mistress or coke dealer

16:12.389 --> 16:13.807
while we're doing our jobs.

16:14.308 --> 16:16.476
Anyway, maybe when I first asked,
that was fair enough.

16:16.476 --> 16:20.022
There was no clear evidence
linking any of the residents to the crime,

16:20.772 --> 16:22.107
but what if now there is?

16:23.984 --> 16:27.196
The girl was waiting outside
the Hamilton-Sweeney apartment building.

16:27.738 --> 16:31.450
William Hamilton-Sweeney was followed
from the Hamilton-Sweeney Group offices.

16:31.450 --> 16:32.868
There is a clear connection.

16:32.868 --> 16:33.952
To who?

16:33.952 --> 16:36.455
I mean, I know from the papers
Bill Senior's in legal trouble.

16:36.455 --> 16:39.958
Bill wasn't at the party
or at the office on either of those days.

16:39.958 --> 16:44.713
According to witnesses, William went
to see his step-uncle, Amory Gould.

16:45.756 --> 16:48.592
- That's gonna be a tough--
- Gould was at the party too.

16:50.302 --> 16:53.764
Come on. It's enough to justify
seeing if he or anyone else of interest

16:53.764 --> 16:54.932
is on those tapes.

16:56.892 --> 16:58.268
Gould is a big donor.

16:58.268 --> 17:00.604
Across the department,
city council, the Mayor.

17:00.604 --> 17:01.939
It's gonna get sticky.

17:03.315 --> 17:05.192
Captain, I just heard from the hospital.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.652
The girl might not make it.

17:07.319 --> 17:10.989
We got her, this arson death,
now William Hamilton-Sweeney's missing.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.700
This could be shaping up to be
a triple homicide.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.993
You wanna waive
this guy's parking tickets? That's on you.

17:15.993 --> 17:19.205
But looking the other way right now
is wrong.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.627
You get a signature, you got your warrant.

17:23.627 --> 17:25.838
Good luck finding a judge
not in Gould's pocket.

17:25.838 --> 17:27.297
Thank you.

17:28.173 --> 17:29.633
- Sir.
- What you got?

17:31.301 --> 17:33.345
Forensics came back
on that bombing in the Bronx.

17:34.012 --> 17:36.390
Looks like someone got ahold of
a shit ton of fireworks.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.309
Samantha Yeung's father makes fireworks.

17:45.023 --> 17:49.152
Hello? Yeah? Yeah.

17:50.195 --> 17:51.613
Thank you. Bye.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.075
Get dressed.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.869
- What happened?
- I know where he is.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.002
Came as soon as you called.

18:05.586 --> 18:06.587
Thanks.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.672
Why did a teacher from our school
sleep over?

18:09.631 --> 18:12.968
His name is Mercer,
and he's your uncle William's boyfriend.

18:13.552 --> 18:17.848
Yes, I am a teacher named Mercer,

18:17.848 --> 18:20.517
and William's boyfriend.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.853
Where's our uncle? I wanna meet him.

18:22.853 --> 18:25.355
And hopefully,
you'll be doing that very soon.

18:27.399 --> 18:28.400
Bye.

18:29.151 --> 18:32.571
I love you, like, a lot.

18:34.489 --> 18:37.409
Hey, look at me.
I'm gonna explain everything to you.

18:39.995 --> 18:43.207
Hey. I don't wanna sound like a dick,

18:43.207 --> 18:45.584
but you're pulling Regan
back into William's life.

18:46.376 --> 18:47.878
We got a lot going on right now, and--

18:48.921 --> 18:52.049
Well, you probably noticed
William makes everything more complicated.

18:52.049 --> 18:53.759
Maybe what makes things complicated

18:53.759 --> 18:55.969
is the fact that they were separated
in the first place.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.680
I just want what's best for Regan.

19:00.474 --> 19:03.143
Clearly my well-being
is your top priority.

19:04.061 --> 19:05.312
I'll look out for myself.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.272
Okay. Just be careful.

19:08.357 --> 19:11.068
I guess I'll add this to
the list of things William never told me.

19:11.068 --> 19:12.402
You have a house in The Hamptons.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.321
Though I guess I'd be surprised
if you didn't.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.323
It was the last place
we were all together.

19:17.658 --> 19:21.036
The last place we were truly happy.

19:31.463 --> 19:34.716
<i>After my mom died,
my dad lost himself in his work</i>

19:34.716 --> 19:36.885
<i>and his new girlfriend, Felicia.</i>

19:37.678 --> 19:39.847
<i>William and I
were everything to each other.</i>

19:40.639 --> 19:41.640
<i>I mean, everything.</i>

19:44.434 --> 19:47.354
Look at Amory.
Lucifer and his three witches.

19:48.105 --> 19:49.481
What do you think they're talking about?

19:50.566 --> 19:55.445
The coven is planning to frolic naked
in the woods tonight under a full moon.

19:55.445 --> 19:59.116
I bet they sacrifice
a Bear Stearns intern.

19:59.658 --> 20:02.244
Regan, dear,
there's someone I want you to meet.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.329
Do you have someone you want me to meet?

20:05.080 --> 20:06.832
This one's not quite your type.

20:08.417 --> 20:09.418
Come this way.

20:11.503 --> 20:13.797
- Okay, what are you doing?
- Here she is.

20:14.464 --> 20:17.509
This is Bill's daughter,
Regan Hamilton-Sweeney.

20:17.509 --> 20:18.594
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:18.594 --> 20:20.846
Just down from Vassar.
Isn't she exquisite?

20:20.846 --> 20:25.684
It's like one of Botticelli's angels
has merged with one of Charlie's Angels.

20:25.684 --> 20:29.563
Why do you talk like that?
There has to be some kind of explanation.

20:29.563 --> 20:30.856
He means it as a compliment.

20:30.856 --> 20:32.566
- Right, Mr. Gould?
- That's correct.

20:32.566 --> 20:34.359
My father speaks the same
ancient language,

20:34.359 --> 20:35.944
I've just become fluent by necessity.

20:35.944 --> 20:38.447
This witty young man
is going to school at Yale.

20:38.447 --> 20:41.950
And yes, he is the son of
your father's new partner.

20:41.950 --> 20:46.038
A partnership which will make
both of you very rich one day,

20:46.914 --> 20:50.209
providing everything goes well
with the merger.

20:50.209 --> 20:53.378
Speaking of mergers,
I'll let you two get acquainted.

20:56.048 --> 20:58.050
Oh, my God. I'm sorry. He's a psycho.

20:59.927 --> 21:01.595
- No doubt.
- Yeah.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.973
I actually asked him to introduce us.

21:04.973 --> 21:07.017
I thought maybe we could go somewhere
and talk.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.063
Oh, yeah. Sure.

21:19.238 --> 21:22.199
Everyone, hello!

21:23.075 --> 21:26.537
Thank you all so much for coming.

21:26.537 --> 21:31.542
Today is a day I will remember forever,

21:31.542 --> 21:37.631
and not only because this is
the best party of the summer.

21:39.091 --> 21:40.259
Oh, yeah.

21:40.259 --> 21:44.680
Because this is the day
Bill and I announce

21:44.680 --> 21:48.725
we are going to be married!

21:50.269 --> 21:51.520
That's right!

21:51.520 --> 21:54.481
This is an engagement party! Whoo!

21:58.694 --> 22:00.112
Really, Dad?

22:00.946 --> 22:02.739
I know how both of you feel about her.

22:02.739 --> 22:05.033
So you thought this was
the way to tell us?

22:05.033 --> 22:07.035
I asked her not to do it this way.

22:07.035 --> 22:08.120
Yeah, exactly.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.914
That's why
we feel the way we feel about her.

22:11.665 --> 22:12.791
Dad.

22:12.791 --> 22:15.878
Honey, just be happy for me.

22:29.308 --> 22:31.435
I mean,
you gotta hand it to her, right?

22:31.435 --> 22:33.854
Like, she got him to buy the ring.

22:33.854 --> 22:35.522
Do you think that she's pregnant?

22:37.232 --> 22:38.817
- She has to be right?
- What? No.

22:38.817 --> 22:41.278
Like-- Felicia gain 30 pounds?

22:41.278 --> 22:42.821
I mean, are you kidding me?

22:42.821 --> 22:44.907
No amount of money ever.

22:46.116 --> 22:47.576
What is happening?

22:48.535 --> 22:51.496
You don't stop. I like it.

22:52.539 --> 22:58.462
Well, my brother and I
are processing some rather tragic news.

22:59.588 --> 23:01.131
Tragic.

23:01.131 --> 23:03.717
Maybe we should go for a walk.
Get some air.

23:04.551 --> 23:07.095
We're outside. We have air.

23:08.222 --> 23:09.932
- Hey, William.
- Hi, Bret.

23:10.432 --> 23:11.558
Hi.

23:12.643 --> 23:13.977
Come here for a sec.

23:15.979 --> 23:18.524
Yeah, yeah, no-- Go, go, go, go, go, go.

23:18.524 --> 23:22.528
Just don't let Dad catch you.
Don't give Felicia the win.

23:22.528 --> 23:23.946
Be careful.

23:26.615 --> 23:29.034
Guess who got a key to the cottage.

23:29.034 --> 23:31.703
Yes. There's a full bar in there.

23:46.260 --> 23:48.595
Finally, the little prince awakens.

23:48.595 --> 23:51.723
I was waiting to see if I should call
the police or the coroner.

23:51.723 --> 23:54.685
No. Please don't call anyone.

23:58.522 --> 23:59.857
It's Jacob, right?

23:59.857 --> 24:01.108
You remember my name.

24:02.276 --> 24:04.278
Don't recall you ever using it
to say hello,

24:04.278 --> 24:07.865
or acknowledging me much at all,
for that matter.

24:09.283 --> 24:10.284
I'm sorry.

24:14.121 --> 24:17.332
I apologize for my behavior.

24:18.166 --> 24:20.586
- People change.
- Not people like you.

24:22.462 --> 24:23.463
Let me guess.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.382
You shoot your inheritance up your arm,

24:25.382 --> 24:28.844
and then you show up here in the dead of
night to steal the family silver.

24:30.220 --> 24:31.471
I understand.

24:32.931 --> 24:36.643
And I realize you never really liked me

24:36.643 --> 24:40.397
or approved of my lifestyle,

24:41.231 --> 24:47.321
but I know you have worked
for my parents and my sister loyally

24:47.321 --> 24:48.572
for decades.

24:49.281 --> 24:51.617
And I am here...

24:53.785 --> 24:55.871
because I just wanna save my family.

24:55.871 --> 25:00.334
Well, I can't argue. I found you
a spoiled child and ungrateful teen.

25:00.334 --> 25:02.753
But as for your lifestyle,

25:02.753 --> 25:07.299
if you'd taken the slightest interest
in the household help,

25:07.925 --> 25:11.970
you'd have known
that I partook in this said lifestyle

25:11.970 --> 25:13.722
long before it was fashionable.

25:17.267 --> 25:18.310
But, yes.

25:20.312 --> 25:23.524
Your mom was very dear to me.
God rest her soul.

25:24.566 --> 25:29.238
Despite everything they had, your family
deserved better than what they got.

25:29.238 --> 25:30.322
Yeah.

25:33.492 --> 25:36.578
And there is one person
responsible for that.

25:37.162 --> 25:41.458
Amory Gould got where he is
by paying off busboys and doormen.

25:41.458 --> 25:45.212
Digging up dirt on exactly the same people
he now calls his friends.

25:45.212 --> 25:46.296
Yeah, extortion.

25:47.589 --> 25:48.590
Exactly...

25:49.466 --> 25:51.593
but the fucker was smart.

25:52.135 --> 25:54.847
He was after something
way more valuable than cash.

25:55.347 --> 25:56.348
What?

25:57.057 --> 25:58.100
Access.

25:58.809 --> 26:02.688
He traded silence for invitations.

26:03.188 --> 26:06.149
Weaseled his way to tables at fundraisers...

26:06.149 --> 26:08.694
- Uh-huh.
- ...and seats on private jets.

26:08.694 --> 26:12.990
And pretty soon, he's sitting at
Bianca Jagger's table at Studio 54,

26:12.990 --> 26:15.242
and nobody even remembers
how he got there.

26:16.535 --> 26:19.454
- I caught this old guy following me once.
- Yeah?

26:19.454 --> 26:22.791
I thought I was getting cruised
until I recognized him.

26:22.791 --> 26:27.462
I'd seen him out here before, with Amory.

26:28.714 --> 26:30.841
I think he was some kind of PI.

26:34.386 --> 26:35.596
Amory's cottage.

26:36.972 --> 26:38.724
What are you hoping to find inside?

26:39.975 --> 26:41.727
- Proof.
- Of his blackmailing?

26:42.311 --> 26:46.190
Of his connection
to the shooting of an innocent girl.

26:46.190 --> 26:47.357
What? Murder?

26:47.357 --> 26:49.651
Uh-huh. What?

26:50.485 --> 26:53.488
You don't think Amory could be involved
in something like that?

26:54.156 --> 26:58.452
On the contrary,
I think Amory Gould is a very bad man.

27:04.750 --> 27:09.004
No, no. I didn't say-- No. I don't know
what I-- Get the fuck off of me.

27:09.004 --> 27:12.299
Oh, come on. What are you crying about?
You liked it.

27:15.219 --> 27:16.220
Ms. Regan?

27:20.057 --> 27:22.017
Regan!

27:32.194 --> 27:33.612
Hey! You!

27:37.783 --> 27:39.284
Did you have a good time?

27:52.047 --> 27:53.048
So you knew.

27:54.007 --> 27:56.593
I knew what I felt in my gut and my heart.

27:57.511 --> 28:00.347
In any case, it wasn't my place.

28:02.683 --> 28:05.936
That was the argument, wasn't it?
The day of the wedding.

28:18.866 --> 28:23.412
Okay. I know this wedding
is totally fucked up, but it is happening.

28:24.037 --> 28:28.750
And you have been off at college, right?

28:28.750 --> 28:31.044
Gallivanting around all of Italy,

28:31.044 --> 28:34.173
while I have been right here,

28:35.048 --> 28:40.888
waging a full-on terror campaign
against the unholiest of matrimonies.

28:42.347 --> 28:43.348
Really, it just--

28:44.683 --> 28:46.810
It just made Dad hate me more, so...

28:48.979 --> 28:50.022
You want this?

28:50.856 --> 28:51.899
Okay.

28:52.566 --> 28:53.984
So this isn't about the wedding.

28:56.111 --> 28:57.112
Seriously,

28:58.739 --> 29:00.574
- why the tears?
- Oh, please.

29:00.574 --> 29:02.242
I'm not fucking crying.

29:02.743 --> 29:03.744
Come on.

29:04.244 --> 29:08.957
You are Daddy's favorite,
you graduated summa cum laude,

29:08.957 --> 29:14.087
you are the future of this company,

29:15.464 --> 29:19.635
and that varsity rower
boyfriend of yours--

29:21.011 --> 29:24.348
I'm not really sure about his IQ,
but that wingspan--

29:28.060 --> 29:30.020
You have a perfect life, Reg.

29:31.772 --> 29:32.981
I can--

29:35.108 --> 29:37.569
I can handle him coming to the wedding.

29:39.238 --> 29:42.991
But Amory just told me that
Daddy's giving him a seat on the board?

29:42.991 --> 29:48.163
Like,
he's gonna be part of our lives forever.

29:48.163 --> 29:49.540
I can never work there.

29:49.540 --> 29:52.251
- I can never work there.
- I don't know who you're talking about.

29:52.251 --> 29:55.379
I can't tell you. I can't tell--
I haven't even told Keith.

29:55.379 --> 29:56.797
Tell Keith what?

29:57.297 --> 29:59.424
What could you possibly have
to tell Keith? That you fucked a guy?

29:59.424 --> 30:00.801
Okay, Reg,

30:00.801 --> 30:02.886
that is none of Keith's business.

30:07.015 --> 30:08.308
It wasn't a fuck.

30:16.358 --> 30:17.901
Oh, my God. Hey.

30:27.828 --> 30:30.706
Was it that guy
from the party last year?

30:33.000 --> 30:37.212
When I woke up,
he said you had left early.

30:37.212 --> 30:38.964
You had to get on the road
to get back to school.

30:38.964 --> 30:40.841
- You wanted to beat traffic.
- Yeah, well, he lied.

30:40.841 --> 30:41.842
Fuck.

30:43.010 --> 30:44.178
Well, then he should go to prison.

30:44.178 --> 30:47.014
What?
With all the other Ivy League rapists?

30:47.681 --> 30:49.141
It's his word against mine.

30:49.850 --> 30:51.476
You know how that goes.

30:54.605 --> 30:55.606
Fuck.

31:00.527 --> 31:02.154
I knew I should've stayed with you.

31:02.154 --> 31:05.073
Yeah, you couldn't have known.
I didn't know.

31:06.450 --> 31:10.954
He took me to the cottage.

31:14.291 --> 31:17.169
You know Amory's the only one
who has a key to that, right?

31:19.796 --> 31:21.006
Fucking Amory.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.474
- Did you tell Dad?
- Of course not.

31:30.474 --> 31:32.476
We have to keep those people
away from our family.

31:32.476 --> 31:33.852
The merger's already done.

31:33.852 --> 31:35.270
I'm talking about the Goulds.

31:36.021 --> 31:38.065
Come on! We have to go tell him right now.

31:38.065 --> 31:40.108
Please, William. Please don't do anything.

31:40.108 --> 31:41.401
Okay. I'm sorry.

31:41.401 --> 31:42.986
Please.

31:42.986 --> 31:44.196
You need to tell Dad.

31:47.908 --> 31:49.076
You need to.

32:05.342 --> 32:07.636
<i>La la la la</i>

32:10.347 --> 32:14.142
Our new business partners will not be
joining us at the celebrations today

32:15.143 --> 32:18.021
or for any social engagements
in the future.

32:18.021 --> 32:19.690
And now that she's graduated,

32:20.649 --> 32:22.818
Regan will be receiving
a seat on the board.

32:23.861 --> 32:25.612
I wasn't aware a board seat was available.

32:25.612 --> 32:26.989
I just made it available.

32:32.494 --> 32:33.328
So, that's it?

32:33.328 --> 32:37.708
This matter is between your sister and me,
and we've had a frank, private discussion.

32:37.708 --> 32:40.669
And we are taking steps
to remedy the situation as best we can.

32:40.669 --> 32:42.087
Okay, I mean--

32:42.087 --> 32:44.298
I just--

32:44.965 --> 32:48.969
I just figured your best would maybe
include keeping a rape-enabling psychopath

32:48.969 --> 32:51.138
- out of our family, but--
- William, please.

32:51.138 --> 32:54.016
I don't even understand the words that are
coming out of your mouth right now.

32:54.016 --> 32:57.686
Well, if they're vitriolic and irrational,
I believe they would be aimed at me.

32:57.686 --> 32:59.813
Oh, yeah. And I would be more than happy

32:59.813 --> 33:01.231
- to explain them to you.
- Don't!

33:01.231 --> 33:02.858
William,
I've had just about enough out of you

33:02.858 --> 33:05.611
with these childish outbursts
and condescending comments.

33:05.611 --> 33:08.113
Not to mention all the checks
I've had to write recently

33:08.113 --> 33:10.866
- every time you get kicked out of school.
- Oh, right. 'Cause it's so bad.

33:10.866 --> 33:15.162
And don't think I don't know
about your trips to the park at night.

33:25.130 --> 33:26.465
Are you spying on me?

33:26.465 --> 33:28.383
Did you really believe
your father was gonna allow you

33:28.383 --> 33:30.802
to freely roam the city unobserved?

33:32.221 --> 33:34.598
So you observed me, huh?

33:35.474 --> 33:38.185
Okay. Dad...

33:39.603 --> 33:42.648
this person is a pervert,

33:43.232 --> 33:47.236
and she is a money-grubbing soul-sucker.

33:47.945 --> 33:52.241
They're both vampires
feasting on our family!

33:52.241 --> 33:54.368
Bill, he cannot speak to us that way.

33:54.368 --> 33:57.496
- You are way over the line, young man!
- What line? Please. A line?

33:57.496 --> 33:59.873
After what he did to Regan?

34:01.333 --> 34:02.793
I would never hurt either of you.

34:02.793 --> 34:07.714
William. William,
we can't know for sure what he did.

34:08.924 --> 34:12.219
Yes, he's a liar, obviously.

34:12.219 --> 34:16.306
But we'll never know
if he's lying about this. Right?

34:16.306 --> 34:18.225
- I mean, I was drunk.
- No.

34:18.225 --> 34:19.726
Yes, it was stupid!

34:19.726 --> 34:22.437
- Are you serious?
- I'm not gonna ruin Dad's life over this.

34:23.897 --> 34:26.733
I'm not trying to ruin his life. I'm not.

34:26.733 --> 34:29.319
I'm trying to save it.
I'm trying to save yours.

34:29.319 --> 34:33.739
Hey, Reg, please stand up for yourself
right now.

34:34.616 --> 34:35.449
Come on!

34:37.536 --> 34:38.536
Come--

34:42.248 --> 34:45.043
You know what? Fuck you all.

34:46.210 --> 34:47.588
You're all dead inside.

34:47.588 --> 34:51.592
And I am gonna get outta here
before you kill me too. Okay?

34:51.592 --> 34:53.719
So, have a great wedding.

34:54.636 --> 34:57.181
Or should I say funeral, really?

35:00.434 --> 35:05.397
And that was the last time that I saw her
or any of them for 15 years.

35:09.526 --> 35:10.819
What the hell is this, Regan?

35:12.237 --> 35:13.363
What?

35:13.363 --> 35:14.948
She was pregnant?

35:20.537 --> 35:21.830
Holy shit.

35:23.123 --> 35:25.000
I bet that Ivy League fucker
knocked her up.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.503
She must've taken care of it
before she went to Italy.

35:30.422 --> 35:31.924
Or she never went to Italy.

35:39.056 --> 35:40.057
That poor girl.

35:41.058 --> 35:42.142
Oh, my God.

35:42.684 --> 35:43.936
I can't believe...

35:44.561 --> 35:47.439
Regan went through this shit
and didn't say anything to me.

35:47.439 --> 35:49.107
If I would've known, I would've done-- I--

35:49.107 --> 35:52.236
I would've done things differently, right?
Everything.

35:52.736 --> 35:55.155
Jesus. Amory's got files on all of us.

35:55.155 --> 35:57.407
Yours is as thick as a fucking phone book.

35:57.407 --> 35:59.117
Your bandmate's overdose.

35:59.117 --> 36:02.371
Practically every guy you were ever with
or bought a bag off.

36:02.371 --> 36:04.289
But nothing on Nicky?

36:04.289 --> 36:05.582
That doesn't make any sense.

36:05.582 --> 36:08.502
- What's this one?
- That's a business pile.

36:08.502 --> 36:10.420
This would be personal, right?

36:15.592 --> 36:18.554
Unless this is business for Amory.

36:25.018 --> 36:26.728
Holy fucking shit.

36:26.728 --> 36:28.564
Wait. Who's Nicholas McKay?

36:28.564 --> 36:32.734
Nicky, Nicky Chaos.
This is his juvie records.

36:32.734 --> 36:34.236
His PI reports.

36:40.158 --> 36:43.829
"Public mischief. Shoplifting.

36:44.746 --> 36:45.747
Arson.

36:47.416 --> 36:49.793
Arson. More arson."

36:54.173 --> 36:56.466
"McKay is not an intravenous drug user.

36:56.466 --> 36:59.928
I do believe, however,
that he may suffer from pyromania"...

37:04.266 --> 37:07.978
..."an impulse control disorder resulting
from unprocessed childhood trauma

37:07.978 --> 37:10.439
usually seen in young men.

37:10.439 --> 37:12.566
Based on his predilection for arson,

37:13.066 --> 37:17.487
I would ask you to consider McKay
as a candidate for the 'LH project.'"

37:17.988 --> 37:19.656
What's that, the LH project?

37:20.240 --> 37:21.241
I don't know.

37:23.660 --> 37:26.038
But I know someone who might.

37:29.917 --> 37:33.003
I gotta get back to town, ASAP.

37:33.003 --> 37:34.546
Gotta catch a bus or a train.

37:34.546 --> 37:37.090
Or I could
gas up that stolen boat for you.

37:38.091 --> 37:40.177
I mean,
I should probably give that back, huh?

37:40.177 --> 37:41.261
Yeah.

37:47.059 --> 37:48.268
I called.

37:48.268 --> 37:50.187
She said to keep you here
until she arrived.

38:02.491 --> 38:03.575
Dude, you're alive!

38:04.201 --> 38:05.035
Yeah.

38:06.995 --> 38:08.372
I was so worried.

38:08.372 --> 38:10.290
I'm okay. I am.

38:17.756 --> 38:22.010
William,
something terrible has happened.

38:23.345 --> 38:25.055
It's Bruno.

39:17.900 --> 39:18.901
Hi.

39:19.401 --> 39:21.486
I'm gonna need to see your security tapes.

39:23.739 --> 39:26.658
Strontium nitrate burns red.
Copper chloride burns blue.

39:26.658 --> 39:30.078
Now, you combine these two powders,
and you get a new color. Purple.

39:30.078 --> 39:32.706
Just like a kid with crayons.

39:32.706 --> 39:34.041
<i>Okay, what about black powder?</i>

39:34.041 --> 39:36.418
Something called pulverone.
You keep any of that?

39:36.418 --> 39:38.128
Of course. That's the explosion.

39:38.128 --> 39:40.047
That's how the whole thing
gets off the ground.

39:40.047 --> 39:41.924
But that's in a separate bin.

39:43.217 --> 39:44.218
Locked.

39:50.516 --> 39:51.683
What the hell?

39:55.521 --> 39:58.148
- What is it?
- It's gone. All of it.

39:58.148 --> 40:00.317
Okay, what can someone do with that,
with what's missing?

40:03.153 --> 40:04.238
Take down a city block.

40:19.586 --> 40:22.798
All right,
let's get it done. This is it.

40:27.135 --> 40:28.470
She's beautiful.

40:34.810 --> 40:37.521
Hey, Prophet. You're just in time.

40:44.903 --> 40:45.946
For what?

40:45.946 --> 40:48.824
Our project is now complete.

40:51.952 --> 40:53.829
Come on. Come.

40:54.746 --> 40:56.039
Meet...

40:57.165 --> 40:59.084
the demon brother.

41:17.019 --> 41:18.687
Okay. Stop here.

41:19.438 --> 41:20.689
Play it in real time.

41:22.941 --> 41:24.693
Jesus, Nicky,
you're gonna fucking kill us!

41:25.277 --> 41:26.737
Turn it off!

41:34.620 --> 41:36.288
I'm just fucking with you.

41:36.914 --> 41:37.915
So, it's not a bomb?

41:37.915 --> 41:40.459
Oh, no. It's most definitely a bomb.

41:41.710 --> 41:45.881
I just gotta hook up
the timer and the detonator.

41:48.133 --> 41:49.468
But not yet.

41:55.557 --> 41:57.100
What do you plan on doing with it?

41:57.100 --> 41:58.852
Answering your prayers.

41:59.728 --> 42:03.315
What if I told you I had the knowledge
that you've been searching for

42:03.315 --> 42:05.150
ever since you turned up on our doorstep?

42:05.984 --> 42:10.155
What if this could deliver you vengeance

42:11.532 --> 42:14.910
against the devil
responsible for Sam's shooting?

42:23.252 --> 42:24.753
You know who shot Sam?

42:25.754 --> 42:27.840
Yeah. I'm pretty fucking sure.

42:28.465 --> 42:31.635
He's a man who believes in
killing to protect his secrets,

42:32.427 --> 42:34.471
and Sam knew too many of his.

42:35.764 --> 42:37.099
You know this guy?

42:38.308 --> 42:40.519
I mean, can't totally see his face

42:40.519 --> 42:42.020
- but it's--
- But the hair?

42:42.020 --> 42:44.273
Yeah. And those pants.

42:44.773 --> 42:46.608
He's entering from the park.

42:47.442 --> 42:48.527
Look at the time stamp.

42:48.527 --> 42:51.488
He was gone from the party
right around the time our victim was shot.

42:53.323 --> 42:54.324
Mr. Gould?

42:57.703 --> 43:00.372
Look, Nicky,
of course I wish for nothing more

43:00.372 --> 43:02.374
than to see Sam's shooter
brought to justice.

43:02.374 --> 43:06.795
And yeah, certainly in my darkest moments,
I wished--

43:07.379 --> 43:10.299
Okay,
I prayed for that person to die.

43:10.299 --> 43:11.508
But that--

43:11.508 --> 43:13.719
I mean, that's a big-ass bomb.

43:18.182 --> 43:19.933
A painter paints.

43:20.976 --> 43:23.937
A dancer dances.

43:25.689 --> 43:29.943
I give birth to a force
with a life all of its own.

43:30.569 --> 43:32.654
Yo, fire breathes, Charlie.

43:34.781 --> 43:40.787
But, unlike us, it has the power
to change water to steam.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.583
Solid to liquid.

43:46.502 --> 43:47.669
Liquid to light.

43:50.172 --> 43:54.676
Fire is an alchemist. A magician.

43:57.679 --> 44:00.933
It's poetic justice
that this is how he should die,

44:02.476 --> 44:07.147
consumed by the beautiful monster
he paid me to unleash.

44:14.071 --> 44:15.906
What a bunch of bullshit.

44:20.410 --> 44:22.287
Do you even care about gentrification...

44:23.163 --> 44:26.041
about artists and dreamers?
Or do you just like burning shit?

44:26.041 --> 44:27.376
- Charlie.
- No, for real.

44:27.376 --> 44:29.545
Are you just some sick fuck
who likes fire,

44:29.545 --> 44:31.004
and everything else is a lie

44:31.004 --> 44:33.382
because the only other thing
you get off on is controlling people?

44:33.382 --> 44:35.968
Hey. You need to leave now, Prophet.

44:39.221 --> 44:40.889
Ayo, this isn't gonna work out.

44:46.144 --> 44:47.145
Fine by me.

44:49.439 --> 44:51.859
He can't leave.

44:52.985 --> 44:54.152
Why not?

44:55.153 --> 44:59.449
He knows too much. Like, everything.

45:02.369 --> 45:04.329
Fuck it.
What's another body at this point?

45:04.329 --> 45:05.497
What? No!

45:05.497 --> 45:06.623
You're not killing Charlie!

45:06.623 --> 45:08.542
Do you hear yourself right now?

45:08.542 --> 45:10.294
Look, she's right.
He's just a little fucking kid.

45:10.294 --> 45:12.004
He's not gonna do anything.
I need you to calm down.

45:12.004 --> 45:13.297
- You're doing a lot.
- How do you know?

45:13.297 --> 45:15.299
- Don't put your fucking hands on me!
- Yo! Sol!

45:15.299 --> 45:17.050
Give me a reason to knock someone out.

45:17.050 --> 45:19.386
- If anyone moves.
- Sol! Stop! Please.

45:19.386 --> 45:21.013
- Come on!
- After him! You're letting him fucking...

45:21.013 --> 45:22.472
- Fuck.
- Sol, stop!

45:22.973 --> 45:23.974
Please!

45:56.298 --> 45:57.299
Fuck!

46:03.263 --> 46:05.057
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

46:05.641 --> 46:07.809
- It's a bomb.
- Excuse me?

46:07.809 --> 46:10.062
There are these guys,
they're making a bomb.

46:10.062 --> 46:11.396
Henry Mechanics alley.

46:12.773 --> 46:15.442
It's an old restaurant, Cicciaro's.

46:16.026 --> 46:18.403
It's big. The bomb, not the restaurant.

46:18.403 --> 46:20.906
<i>Who is this?
Can I get more information?</i>

46:21.532 --> 46:22.783
Yeah, you need to hurry.

46:24.826 --> 46:27.788
This is Charles Weisbarger.
And I'm not fucking around.
