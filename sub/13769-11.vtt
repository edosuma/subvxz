00:02.753 --> 00:04.672
I can't believe

00:02.753 --> 00:04.672
we're locked out.

00:04.713 --> 00:06.214
Mom won't be home

00:04.713 --> 00:06.214
until 6:00.

00:06.256 --> 00:08.049
Hang on. I know

00:06.256 --> 00:08.049
how to get in.

00:08.091 --> 00:10.135
Here it is.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.053
I'll do it.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.264
Thanks.

00:14.306 --> 00:16.391
That credit card thing

00:14.306 --> 00:16.391

Why do you have to take

00:54.596 --> 00:56.306
your pillow to your sister's?

00:56.348 --> 00:58.183
Well, Hal, I don't know how long

00:56.348 --> 00:58.183
I'm going to be there.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.977
I want to be comfortable.

01:00.019 --> 01:01.395
Well, what am I supposed

01:00.019 --> 01:01.395
to sniff while you're gone?

01:01.436 --> 01:02.938
Mom's baby doctor

01:01.436 --> 01:02.938
is making her move

01:02.980 --> 01:04.189
to her sister's house

01:02.980 --> 01:04.189
for a while.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.941
Dad's starting

01:04.231 --> 01:05.941
to get used to it.

01:05.983 --> 01:08.109
At least now he goes out

01:05.983 --> 01:08.109
to the garage to cry.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.111
Aha! No coaster.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.197
Look at that ring.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.616
That is why I have to move

01:12.239 --> 01:14.616
out of this house.

01:14.658 --> 01:15.826
Mom.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.160
Every time you boys

01:15.868 --> 01:17.160
thoughtlessly

01:17.202 --> 01:19.914
mar the furniture

01:17.202 --> 01:19.914
by refusing to use coasters,

01:19.955 --> 01:21.081
what are you doing?

01:22.416 --> 01:24.543
ALL:

01:22.416 --> 01:24.543
Killing the baby.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.169
Killing the baby.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.380
Every time

01:26.211 --> 01:28.380
you run through the house,

01:28.422 --> 01:30.215
every time

01:28.422 --> 01:30.215
you destroy furniture,

01:30.257 --> 01:32.175
every time

01:30.257 --> 01:32.175
you fight with each other,

01:32.217 --> 01:34.135
you are killing the baby.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.136
Lois, the doctor

01:34.177 --> 01:35.136
just said

01:35.178 --> 01:36.430
you should avoid stress.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.182
Which is just medical jargon

01:36.471 --> 01:39.182
for the simple fact

01:39.224 --> 01:41.309
that every time

01:39.224 --> 01:41.309
you boys misbehave,

01:41.351 --> 01:42.811
you might as well

01:41.351 --> 01:42.811
be taking a knife

01:42.853 --> 01:44.563
and putting it in that baby's

01:42.853 --> 01:44.563
tiny little heart.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.023
Will you stop

01:44.605 --> 01:46.023
saying that?

01:46.065 --> 01:48.149
I just hope

01:46.065 --> 01:48.149
you boys have the character

01:48.191 --> 01:50.318
to channel the horrible guilt

01:48.191 --> 01:50.318
you should be feeling

01:50.360 --> 01:52.071
into better behavior

01:50.360 --> 01:52.071
while I'm gone.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.406
We're sorry.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.406
Okay.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.406
Yes, Mom.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.620
Oh, my God.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.162
I don't think

01:59.661 --> 02:01.162
I can keep this up.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.748
It's just a few more days

02:01.204 --> 02:02.748
until she leaves.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.041
We can laugh all we want

02:04.083 --> 02:05.333
when she's backing out

02:04.083 --> 02:05.333
of the driveway.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.419
We're not really

02:05.375 --> 02:07.419
hurting the baby, are we?

02:07.461 --> 02:09.004
Please. A week

02:07.461 --> 02:09.004
before you were born,

02:09.046 --> 02:10.547
we tied our playpen

02:09.046 --> 02:10.547
to the back of her car

02:10.589 --> 02:11.673
and followed

02:10.589 --> 02:11.673
her to work.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.050
She's just trying to save face.

02:13.092 --> 02:14.259
She doesn't

02:13.092 --> 02:14.259
want to admit

02:14.301 --> 02:16.177
that we actually drove her

02:14.301 --> 02:16.177
from the house.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.972
And now we're

02:16.219 --> 02:17.972
in charge.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.180
(giggling)

02:19.222 --> 02:22.183
Helga, this cheese is

02:19.222 --> 02:22.183
magnificent.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.185
(laughs)

02:24.227 --> 02:26.897
Would you like to try

02:24.227 --> 02:26.897
just a little bite?

02:26.939 --> 02:28.189
No?

02:28.231 --> 02:30.191
How could you not like cheese?

02:30.233 --> 02:33.236
It is made from something

02:30.233 --> 02:33.236
that comes from you.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.195
Hey, Otto.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.990
Ooh. Francis.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.658
Have you seen

02:36.031 --> 02:37.658
Helga's squeaky toy?

02:37.699 --> 02:40.285
It's the one that looks

02:37.699 --> 02:40.285
like a little fire hydrant.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.579
No, but I did get in

02:40.327 --> 02:42.579
the new branding iron.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.205
Shh.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.917
Do you want to scare the

02:44.247 --> 02:46.917
poor thing out of her wits?

02:46.959 --> 02:48.794
Otto, I know how much

02:46.959 --> 02:48.794
you love Helga,

02:48.836 --> 02:50.211
but we have to do this.

02:50.253 --> 02:53.132
All the cows have

02:50.253 --> 02:53.132
to get branded and de-wormed.

02:53.172 --> 02:55.383
I promise

02:53.172 --> 02:55.383
I will be very careful.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.510
(fretful mutter)

02:56.551 --> 02:58.137
But don't tell her about it.

02:58.177 --> 02:59.847
You know, she is not as brave

02:58.177 --> 02:59.847
as she looks.

02:59.888 --> 03:03.433
I told her one ghost story

02:59.888 --> 03:03.433
around the campfire,

03:03.475 --> 03:07.228
and she had to sleep between

03:03.475 --> 03:07.228
me and Gretchen for a week.

That little elbow move

03:33.338 --> 03:35.256
you added-- where did you

03:33.338 --> 03:35.256
come up with that?

03:35.298 --> 03:37.258
You got me.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.258
I was in the zone.

HAL:

03:37.300 --> 03:38.426
All right, all right.

03:38.468 --> 03:39.720
Can we get back to work?

03:39.761 --> 03:41.055
What? That was perfect.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.263
Yeah.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.263
Yeah. Come on.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.557
Really? Was it so perfect

03:43.598 --> 03:45.308
that you are ready

03:43.598 --> 03:45.308
to go up on stage with it

03:45.350 --> 03:47.186
at the Elks Club

03:45.350 --> 03:47.186
Founders Dinner?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.269
(gasps)

03:48.311 --> 03:49.270
What did you say?

03:49.312 --> 03:50.856
I've been waiting to tell you.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.107
I got us the gig!

03:52.149 --> 03:53.274
Impossible!

03:53.316 --> 03:54.776
They haven't taken

03:53.316 --> 03:54.776
a new act in years.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.361
It's easier to get

03:54.818 --> 03:56.361
on the waiting list

03:56.403 --> 03:57.362
for a new heart.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.739
I know, but this morning

03:58.780 --> 04:00.782
at the gas station,

03:58.780 --> 04:00.782
I saw Eddie Eigen.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.535
He come up to me to say hi,

04:00.824 --> 04:03.535
and he slipped on an oil stain.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.079
He can't perform.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.287
You're kidding.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.287
No, I tell you,

04:06.329 --> 04:08.707
it's like God

04:06.329 --> 04:08.707
backed up that minivan

04:08.749 --> 04:10.291
over his ventriloquist hand.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.376
So, Eddie uses

04:11.418 --> 04:13.754
my cell phone to cancel

04:11.418 --> 04:13.754
with the club.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.882
Two minutes later, I push redial

04:13.795 --> 04:16.882
and got us the gig.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.759
(cheering)

04:18.800 --> 04:20.385
You are the man.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.303
NICKI:

04:20.427 --> 04:22.303
I cannot believe

04:20.427 --> 04:22.303
you don't trust me, Daddy.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.513
I am not seeing Malcolm!

04:23.555 --> 04:24.806
I don't even like him.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.767
I haven't talked to him

04:24.848 --> 04:26.767
in over a month.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.769
Nicki's such a good liar.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.271
That's good

04:28.810 --> 04:31.271
in a girlfriend, right?

04:33.356 --> 04:34.775
He is such a jerk.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.277
I can't believe he's making us

04:34.816 --> 04:37.277
hang out in closets.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.739
Once my mom's gone,

04:40.781 --> 04:42.323
we can hang out at

04:40.781 --> 04:42.323
my house after school.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.533
Thank God.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.953
I can't get away

04:43.575 --> 04:45.953
with anything here.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.165
You were with that girl,

04:48.371 --> 04:50.165
weren't you?

04:50.207 --> 04:51.583
No! I was at the library

04:50.207 --> 04:51.583
studying.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.793
HAL:

04:51.625 --> 04:52.793
You were supposed

04:52.834 --> 04:54.544
to pick your brother up

04:52.834 --> 04:54.544
at school.

04:54.586 --> 04:55.837
There were rocks.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.338
There was a beehive.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.840
But where were you?

04:58.882 --> 05:00.801
You are not allowed

04:58.882 --> 05:00.801
to see that girl.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.137
Her name is Nicki,

05:00.842 --> 05:03.137
and I'm not seeing her.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.638
Every time you lie to me,

05:04.679 --> 05:08.016
it is like you are digging

05:04.679 --> 05:08.016
a tiny little grave.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.226
I am not lying to you!

05:09.268 --> 05:11.061
(door slams)

05:11.103 --> 05:12.353
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.939
(sirens approaching)

05:13.981 --> 05:16.233
You know, Mom,

05:13.981 --> 05:16.233
you're looking lovely today.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.277
People don't appreciate

05:18.318 --> 05:20.195
how lovely you can be

05:18.318 --> 05:20.195
in the right light.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.362
I'm always telling kids

05:20.237 --> 05:21.362
at school

05:21.404 --> 05:23.198
that I have

05:21.404 --> 05:23.198
the loveliest mother.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.992
I'll put on the coffee.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.243
It's Henson.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.162
Make decaf.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.788
HAL:

05:28.203 --> 05:29.788
"A Day in Prison?"

05:29.830 --> 05:31.372
We have no choice.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.874
I am not leaving you here

05:31.414 --> 05:32.874
with Reese like this.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.793
It just sounds so scary.

05:34.835 --> 05:35.794
That's the point.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.045
You take them to prison,

05:37.087 --> 05:38.379
a bunch of criminals scream

05:37.087 --> 05:38.379
at them,

05:38.421 --> 05:39.380
and they come home good.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.301
Hey, they include a snack.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.390
There you go, Helga.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.390
Almost done.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.475
How's it going?

05:50.517 --> 05:51.601
Just finishing

05:50.517 --> 05:51.601
the de-worming.

05:51.643 --> 05:55.230
God, these fumes are horrible.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.232
All right,

05:55.272 --> 05:57.232
let's get this over with.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.984
Wait a minute.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.984
You didn't brand them first?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.735
No. Why?

06:03.530 --> 06:06.033
That'd be the main reason.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.868
(whistling in awe)

06:06.074 --> 06:07.868
Wow!

06:07.909 --> 06:09.494
The Founders Dinner.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.913
Three hours from now,

06:09.536 --> 06:11.913
we'll be singing on that stage.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.081
In the dessert slot!

06:13.123 --> 06:14.249
You can't beat that.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.417
No, you can't.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.417
Big time.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.711
Dewey, I have

06:16.459 --> 06:17.711
to focus,

06:17.752 --> 06:19.296
so I want you to sit

06:17.752 --> 06:19.296
and watch quietly

06:19.338 --> 06:20.421
right over here.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.798
Why do I have to be here?

06:21.840 --> 06:23.591
Why couldn't I go snowboarding

06:21.840 --> 06:23.591
with Reese?

06:23.633 --> 06:25.219
Reese isn't

06:23.633 --> 06:25.219
snowboarding.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.511
That was just a lie

06:25.260 --> 06:26.511
Mommy and Daddy told.

06:26.553 --> 06:27.804
Reese is in jail.

06:27.846 --> 06:28.680
For how long?

06:28.722 --> 06:29.348
A few hours.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.266
Oh.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.434
MAN:

06:31.308 --> 06:33.434
Since there was no

06:31.308 --> 06:33.434
contraband found on

06:33.476 --> 06:34.435
or inside your bodies,

06:34.477 --> 06:35.645
I think

06:34.477 --> 06:35.645
you're ready

06:35.687 --> 06:38.273
to meet some of

06:35.687 --> 06:38.273
the inmates now.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.110
This is Samuel.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.112
I would tell you

06:42.152 --> 06:44.112
what he's in here for,

06:44.154 --> 06:46.948
but it's against the law

06:44.154 --> 06:46.948
for me to say it to minors.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.538
Be with you in a minute.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.793
The ankles were a bit

06:56.083 --> 06:58.793
unnecessarily tight.

07:00.879 --> 07:02.172
(sighs)

07:02.214 --> 07:03.464
(clears throat)

07:03.506 --> 07:05.842
(chains clanking)

07:05.884 --> 07:07.052
All right, so we need

07:07.094 --> 07:08.469
to get a few of

07:07.094 --> 07:08.469
the ground rules

07:08.511 --> 07:09.804
straight.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.725
I own you!

07:13.767 --> 07:15.560
You are  my

07:13.767 --> 07:15.560
property!

07:15.602 --> 07:17.354
And you should know,

07:17.396 --> 07:20.399
I don't take very good care

07:17.396 --> 07:20.399
of my things.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.859
Stand up.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.986
(shouting):

07:22.901 --> 07:24.986
I said stand up!

07:25.028 --> 07:26.529
Turn around!

07:26.571 --> 07:28.489
All the way.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.991
Faster!

07:30.742 --> 07:31.868
See that?

07:31.910 --> 07:33.745
Like a little top.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.497
Sit down!

07:36.539 --> 07:39.542
See how that works?

07:39.584 --> 07:40.668
'Cause in prison,

07:40.710 --> 07:42.796
you got to make your own fun.

07:42.837 --> 07:46.883
And when they toss in punk kids

07:42.837 --> 07:46.883
like you and you,  whoo--

07:46.925 --> 07:48.927
it's like Christmas for me!

07:48.969 --> 07:50.595
If you displease me,

07:50.637 --> 07:55.309
I will not hesitate to grab you

07:50.637 --> 07:55.309
by your pretty little neck,

07:55.350 --> 07:58.228
just squeeze

07:55.350 --> 07:58.228
till your eyes

07:58.270 --> 08:00.897
bulge out of your head,

08:00.939 --> 08:03.524
and then pop them

08:00.939 --> 08:03.524
with a fork.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.819
(laughing)

08:05.860 --> 08:07.528
(gasps)

08:07.570 --> 08:08.780
You think that's funny?

08:08.822 --> 08:10.949
I thought you were  trying

08:08.822 --> 08:10.949
to be funny.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.535
So, I got me a

08:12.033 --> 08:14.535
volunteer, huh?

08:14.577 --> 08:16.330
Well, let me tell

08:14.577 --> 08:16.330
you, cupcakes,

08:16.371 --> 08:19.458
what your first day

08:16.371 --> 08:19.458
up in here gonna be like!

08:21.626 --> 08:25.505
And don't expect no

08:21.626 --> 08:25.505
flowers afterwards.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.549
Malcolm, we have to go!

08:28.591 --> 08:29.926
I'm sorry, Nicki.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.552
I've got to help my mom

08:29.968 --> 08:31.552
drop off the first load

08:31.594 --> 08:32.846
of her stuff

08:31.594 --> 08:32.846
at my aunt's house.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.555
There and back is like

08:32.887 --> 08:34.555
three hours,

08:34.597 --> 08:36.183
but when I get home,

08:34.597 --> 08:36.183
I'll sneak over.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.558
Malcolm!

08:37.600 --> 08:39.560
What were you doing in there?

08:39.602 --> 08:41.062
Finishing up my homework.

So, what'd you think, Dewey?

09:42.165 --> 09:44.292
It's cool.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.292
It's fun the way you guys move.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.292
Yeah.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.626
How come you're always

09:44.334 --> 09:45.626
in the back?

09:45.668 --> 09:48.046
I'm not always

09:45.668 --> 09:48.046
in the...

09:49.672 --> 09:52.300
Well, even if I am, it-it's

09:49.672 --> 09:52.300
not about where anyone is.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.219
It's about what's

09:52.342 --> 09:54.219
best for the group.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.136
Okay.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.136
Yeah.

09:55.178 --> 09:56.637
Why is it best for the group

09:56.679 --> 09:58.056
to put you in the back?

10:02.310 --> 10:05.021
So, a three-hour drive.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.064
Should be nice.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.023
Uh-huh.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.525
We don't get

10:07.065 --> 10:08.525
to be alone

10:08.567 --> 10:09.817
that often anymore,

10:08.567 --> 10:09.817
just the two of us,

10:09.859 --> 10:11.361
and I've been wanting

10:09.859 --> 10:11.361
to talk to you.

10:11.403 --> 10:13.738
What are we going to talk about

10:11.403 --> 10:13.738
for three hours?

10:13.780 --> 10:16.074
Sex.

10:17.075 --> 10:18.159
(panting)

10:18.201 --> 10:20.537
(door locks clunk)

10:25.708 --> 10:27.752
Mom, don't do this!

10:25.708 --> 10:27.752
Malcolm, in

10:25.708 --> 10:27.752
a few days,

10:27.794 --> 10:29.670
I'm going to be gone

10:27.794 --> 10:29.670
for a very long time,

10:29.712 --> 10:30.964
and I need to know

10:29.712 --> 10:30.964
that you're okay.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.467
We are going

10:31.005 --> 10:33.467
to have this talk.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.469
I know about you and Nicki.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.845
I'm not seeing Nicki!

10:35.510 --> 10:37.845
I'm not having sex!

10:37.887 --> 10:40.599
I know about protection!

10:37.887 --> 10:40.599
I know all that stuff!

10:40.640 --> 10:41.724
Malcolm, there's a lot more

10:41.766 --> 10:43.143
to being a sexually

10:41.766 --> 10:43.143
responsible person

10:43.184 --> 10:45.061
than what they teach

10:43.184 --> 10:45.061
you in health class.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.481
It's very different when you're

10:45.103 --> 10:47.481
experiencing it yourself.

10:47.522 --> 10:48.523
Mom, stop.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.191
I'll do anything you ask.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.693
Just don't have

10:50.233 --> 10:52.693
this conversation.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.321
Oh, honey, it's going to happen.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.989
(groaning):

10:54.362 --> 10:55.989
No.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.282
You think I like it?

10:57.324 --> 10:58.783
You think I like

10:57.324 --> 10:58.783
the embarrassment

10:58.825 --> 11:00.160
we're going to be feeling

10:58.825 --> 11:00.160
for the next few hours?

11:00.201 --> 11:01.702
But, Malcolm,

11:00.201 --> 11:01.702
I have no choice.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.580
I cannot be there when

11:01.744 --> 11:03.580
you are having sex.

11:03.622 --> 11:05.748
God!

11:03.622 --> 11:05.748
So I'm going to

11:03.622 --> 11:05.748
try to give you

11:05.790 --> 11:07.708
the benefit of

11:05.790 --> 11:07.708
my experience.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.753
I'm going to bury you with every

11:07.750 --> 11:10.753
piece of information I have.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.507
I don't know what will be

11:10.795 --> 11:13.507
helpful and what won't,

11:13.548 --> 11:15.133
so I'm just going to

11:13.548 --> 11:15.133
tell you everything.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.801
Oh, my God!

11:16.843 --> 11:18.803
The sooner we start,

11:16.843 --> 11:18.803
the sooner it'll be over with.

11:18.845 --> 11:22.932
Now, this is

11:18.845 --> 11:22.932
a diaphragm.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.725
Look, Otto keeps asking me

11:22.974 --> 11:24.725
where Helga is,

11:24.767 --> 11:26.144
and I'm running

11:24.767 --> 11:26.144
out of excuses.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.728
You got to tell

11:26.186 --> 11:27.728
him what happened.

11:27.770 --> 11:28.771
I know.

11:27.770 --> 11:28.771
I'm working on it.

11:28.813 --> 11:29.814
It's just a cow.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.608
A cow that's in his will.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.027
Francis, I've got to thank you

11:31.650 --> 11:34.027
for what you did to Helga.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.570
My budget is

11:34.068 --> 11:35.570
really tight,

11:35.612 --> 11:37.572
and getting a couple

11:35.612 --> 11:37.572
of extra sides of beef

11:37.614 --> 11:39.032
really helped me out.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.742
(laughs): And how did you

11:39.073 --> 11:41.742
achieve that smoky flavor?

11:41.784 --> 11:43.578
That's great stuff, Arnold.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.912
Ray's dad

11:43.620 --> 11:44.912
has a week to live.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.914
Maybe you can do

11:44.954 --> 11:46.914
ten minutes on that.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.042
Otto, I have

11:46.956 --> 11:49.042
to tell you something.

11:49.083 --> 11:52.295
Francis, have

11:49.083 --> 11:52.295
you seen Helga?

11:53.712 --> 11:55.756
No, I haven't.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.301
It is not like her

11:55.798 --> 11:58.301
to wander off alone.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.762
I'm starting

11:59.802 --> 12:01.762
to get scared.

12:01.804 --> 12:02.763
Mmm!

12:02.805 --> 12:03.973
This is delicious.

12:04.015 --> 12:05.225
(chuckles)

12:05.266 --> 12:06.767
Do you think

12:06.809 --> 12:09.604
she ran away because

12:06.809 --> 12:09.604
she was angry with me?

12:09.646 --> 12:11.398
I don't think so.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.733
Well, I should have been

12:11.439 --> 12:14.733
there when you branded her.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.238
I could have held

12:16.695 --> 12:18.238
her little hoof.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.280
(chuckles)

12:19.322 --> 12:20.699
(moans)

12:20.739 --> 12:22.867
So tender, so moist.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.202
You must try some.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.453
(chuckles)

12:25.495 --> 12:26.705
Mm-hmm.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.956
(forced chuckle)

12:28.998 --> 12:32.793
Look at me, enjoying myself

12:28.998 --> 12:32.793
while my Helga is out there,

12:32.835 --> 12:34.170
alone and scared.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.380
That is it.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.839
I will go, and I

12:35.422 --> 12:36.839
will look for her,

12:36.881 --> 12:38.174
and I will find her,

12:38.216 --> 12:40.427
if I have to spend

12:38.216 --> 12:40.427
all night searching!

12:40.468 --> 12:42.220
Otto, if I don't say this

12:40.468 --> 12:42.220
right now,

12:42.262 --> 12:43.597
I am never going to say it.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.098
Yes, go ahead.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.101
Pass the béarnaise

12:46.266 --> 12:48.101
sauce, please.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.646
FRANCIS (shouting):

12:49.894 --> 12:51.646
Helga!

12:51.688 --> 12:53.814
Helga,  meine Liebchen!

12:53.856 --> 12:55.400
Helga!

12:55.442 --> 12:57.026
All that crap you "tough"

12:55.442 --> 12:57.026
guys have been pulling,

12:57.068 --> 12:59.237
well, this is where

12:57.068 --> 12:59.237
it's got you!

12:59.279 --> 13:00.779
This is...

13:01.740 --> 13:03.658
Are you paying attention?!

13:03.700 --> 13:06.827
No. I just realized.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.663
You're in prison.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.457
You're locked up in here

13:08.705 --> 13:10.457
for life.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.833
What do I need to be afraid

13:10.498 --> 13:12.833
of  you  for?

13:14.168 --> 13:16.837
Because the way you've

13:14.168 --> 13:16.837
been screwing up,

13:16.879 --> 13:19.215
you're likely to

13:16.879 --> 13:19.215
end up in here,

13:19.257 --> 13:21.718
and when that

13:19.257 --> 13:21.718
happens,  whoo-wee!

13:21.760 --> 13:23.844
You know, Sammy,

13:21.760 --> 13:23.844
you might want to have someone

13:23.886 --> 13:25.138
smuggle some mouthwash

13:23.886 --> 13:25.138
in a cake.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.681
(boys laughing)

13:28.266 --> 13:30.435
Let me tell you what

13:28.266 --> 13:30.435
happened to the last guy

13:30.477 --> 13:31.852
who made fun of me.

13:31.894 --> 13:35.022
They found just enough

13:31.894 --> 13:35.022
of him to convict me!

13:35.064 --> 13:37.024
Ooh! I am so scared

13:35.064 --> 13:37.024
of prison boy.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.652
What are you going to do,

13:38.693 --> 13:40.903
stretch out your arms

13:38.693 --> 13:40.903
70 miles through the bars

13:40.945 --> 13:42.029
to my house?

13:42.071 --> 13:44.282
(laughter)

13:45.908 --> 13:47.868
And if the sperm

13:45.908 --> 13:47.868
doesn't take,

13:47.910 --> 13:49.036
the uterine wall

13:47.910 --> 13:49.036
sloughs off cells,

13:49.078 --> 13:50.664
and that's what

13:49.078 --> 13:50.664
creates a period.

13:50.705 --> 13:51.872
Women can be very

13:50.705 --> 13:51.872
emotional at that time,

13:51.914 --> 13:53.458
but God help you

13:51.914 --> 13:53.458
if you point it out

13:53.500 --> 13:54.959
because then you're

13:53.500 --> 13:54.959
creating two problems...

13:55.001 --> 13:57.878
♪ Me-may-ma-mo-

13:55.001 --> 13:57.878
me-may-ma-mo-moo ♪

13:57.920 --> 14:00.507
♪ Me-may-ma-mo-me-

13:57.920 --> 14:00.507
may-ma-mo-moo... ♪

14:00.548 --> 14:02.467
I hope I don't get

14:00.548 --> 14:02.467
too nervous tonight.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.260
Kitty bought a new

14:02.509 --> 14:04.260
antiperspirant

14:04.302 --> 14:06.596
I don't have much

14:04.302 --> 14:06.596
confidence in.

14:06.638 --> 14:09.390
No one will even notice

14:06.638 --> 14:09.390
if  I  sweat.

14:09.432 --> 14:10.933
Since I'm (whistles)

14:09.432 --> 14:10.933
in the back the whole time.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.561
I'm in the back

14:10.975 --> 14:13.561
for every song, you know.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.896
And frankly,

14:13.603 --> 14:15.896
I don't think that's fair.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.358
We all agreed on the

14:15.938 --> 14:18.358
choreography, Hal.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.734
Where is this

14:18.399 --> 14:19.734
coming from?

14:19.776 --> 14:21.319
From the back, that's where!

14:22.445 --> 14:23.904
You have such a good voice.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.406
Why don't you ever sing lead?

14:25.448 --> 14:27.908
I don't know.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.787
I was told I sound

14:27.950 --> 14:30.787
a little throaty

14:30.829 --> 14:32.372
in my upper register.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.914
Are you the leader?

14:33.956 --> 14:35.416
Well, there's no leader.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.711
We make all our decisions

14:35.458 --> 14:37.711
as a group.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.920
I don't remember any "group"

14:37.752 --> 14:39.920
vote on these sweaters.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.922
Hey, we all agreed

14:39.962 --> 14:41.922
on these sweaters!

14:41.964 --> 14:43.758
You like these sweaters,

14:41.964 --> 14:43.758
don't you?

14:43.800 --> 14:44.801
Yes, I do.

14:44.843 --> 14:46.010
What's he going to say?

14:46.052 --> 14:47.554
"My brother-in-law,

14:46.052 --> 14:47.554
who's the only reason

14:47.595 --> 14:48.929
"I'm in the group

14:47.595 --> 14:48.929
in the first place,

14:48.971 --> 14:49.930
picked out ugly sweaters"?!

14:49.972 --> 14:51.224
Excuse me?!

14:49.972 --> 14:51.224
Dewey,

14:51.265 --> 14:52.392
what do you think

14:51.265 --> 14:52.392
of these sweaters?

14:52.433 --> 14:53.768
I like them. They're funny.

14:53.810 --> 14:54.977
Oh, see?!

14:55.019 --> 14:56.145
We're going to look

14:55.019 --> 14:56.145
ridiculous tonight!

14:56.187 --> 14:57.564
HAL:

14:56.187 --> 14:57.564
Well, it doesn't matter

14:57.605 --> 14:58.857
how I look.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.983
No one's going to

14:58.898 --> 15:00.983
be able to see me!

15:01.025 --> 15:02.652
Oh, for heaven's sake!

15:02.694 --> 15:04.571
Maybe if you guys worried

15:02.694 --> 15:04.571
more about your voices

15:04.612 --> 15:05.946
and less about

15:04.612 --> 15:05.946
your sweaters...

15:05.988 --> 15:07.657
Oh, now you're

15:05.988 --> 15:07.657
criticizing my singing?!

15:07.699 --> 15:09.534
Puh-lease. You

15:07.699 --> 15:09.534
can't say your name

15:09.576 --> 15:10.951
without changing keys.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.537
I think Malik

15:10.993 --> 15:12.537
sings beautifully!

15:12.579 --> 15:14.038
Of course you do.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.122
You're tone deaf!

15:15.164 --> 15:16.457
Well, at least

15:15.164 --> 15:16.457
when I dance,

15:16.499 --> 15:18.125
it doesn't look like

15:16.499 --> 15:18.125
I hooked my butt up

15:18.167 --> 15:19.001
to a paint mixer!

15:19.043 --> 15:20.461
Oh! Oh, that's it!

15:20.503 --> 15:22.046
You can go up here

15:20.503 --> 15:22.046
without me tonight!

15:22.088 --> 15:23.423
I won't be here either!

15:23.464 --> 15:24.382
Neither will I!

15:24.424 --> 15:25.592
Me, neither!

15:25.633 --> 15:26.967
I don't know why

15:25.633 --> 15:26.967
it took so long

15:27.009 --> 15:28.636
for the scales

15:27.009 --> 15:28.636
to fall from my eyes!

15:28.678 --> 15:31.180
And to reveal you

15:28.678 --> 15:31.180
as you really are!

15:31.222 --> 15:33.641
(all shouting angrily)

15:37.311 --> 15:38.979
And believe me, it's

15:37.311 --> 15:38.979
a lot more sensitive

15:39.021 --> 15:40.981
than most men

15:39.021 --> 15:40.981
understand.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.983
A little bit

15:41.023 --> 15:42.983
goes a long way.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.151
Helga!

15:44.193 --> 15:45.986
Oh, we will never find her!

15:46.028 --> 15:47.488
And it's all my fault!

15:47.530 --> 15:48.698
(sobbing)

15:48.740 --> 15:50.991
No, Otto, it's not.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.991
It's my fault.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.160
I have to

15:51.033 --> 15:53.160
tell you this.

15:53.202 --> 15:57.039
There was an accident,

15:53.202 --> 15:57.039
a tragic branding accident.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.042
I killed Helga,

15:58.249 --> 16:00.042
and I fed her to you,

16:00.084 --> 16:02.002
and I couldn't be more sorry.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.212
What?

16:03.254 --> 16:04.213
She's gone.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.924
She's dead.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.426
I don't think

16:05.965 --> 16:08.426
she suffered.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.010
I'm sorry.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.010
I-I should have told you

16:10.052 --> 16:12.305
right from the beginning,

16:10.052 --> 16:12.305
but I couldn't.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.515
Let me tell

16:12.346 --> 16:14.515
you something.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.684
You are the only boss

16:14.557 --> 16:16.684
I've ever had in my life

16:16.726 --> 16:18.686
that I actually liked,

16:16.726 --> 16:18.686
and what's weird is,

16:18.728 --> 16:21.522
you're the only one

16:18.728 --> 16:21.522
I've ever lied to.

16:21.564 --> 16:24.818
I just couldn't stand the

16:21.564 --> 16:24.818
thought of hurting you.

16:24.859 --> 16:27.904
Thank you for telling me

16:24.859 --> 16:27.904
the truth.

16:27.946 --> 16:30.030
If you want to

16:27.946 --> 16:30.030
fire me, feel free.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.032
Oh, no, no, no.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.075
(sighs)

16:33.117 --> 16:34.494
It was an accident.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.037
I think we should try

16:34.535 --> 16:37.037
to put it all behind us.

16:37.079 --> 16:40.124
I don't deserve a boss like you.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.042
Let us go home.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.295
Oh, Francis,

16:44.337 --> 16:47.674
there is an expression

16:44.337 --> 16:47.674
that you used

16:47.715 --> 16:50.050
that I am unfamiliar with.

16:50.092 --> 16:53.721
What does it mean when you say

16:50.092 --> 16:53.721
"fed her to you"?

16:55.097 --> 16:57.016
(vomiting)

17:03.731 --> 17:05.316
(panting):

17:03.731 --> 17:05.316
Okay.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.318
So, on the night

17:05.358 --> 17:07.318
I lost my virginity,

17:07.360 --> 17:09.278
I learned something

17:07.360 --> 17:09.278
very important

17:09.320 --> 17:11.071
about relationships

17:09.320 --> 17:11.071
and trust.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.908
Your body can be telling

17:11.113 --> 17:13.908
you to do something...

17:13.950 --> 17:15.075
I hope you all appreciate

17:15.117 --> 17:17.286
what those men

17:15.117 --> 17:17.286
were doing for you.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.497
And you might be happy to hear

17:17.328 --> 17:19.497
that in part

17:19.539 --> 17:22.333
because of the fine work

17:19.539 --> 17:22.333
Samuel's done with this program,

17:22.375 --> 17:24.544
he's getting paroled next week.

17:26.796 --> 17:29.716
(mouthing)

17:33.135 --> 17:36.096
Hey, I don't care

17:33.135 --> 17:36.096
if you get out!

17:36.138 --> 17:38.641
You'll never figure out

17:36.138 --> 17:38.641
how to find me.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.479
Jackass.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.940
And people, they hop

17:43.521 --> 17:45.940
from one person to another

17:45.982 --> 17:47.984
trying to get some

17:45.982 --> 17:47.984
sense of validation.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.109
They do this all

17:48.026 --> 17:49.109
through college,

17:49.151 --> 17:50.486
all through

17:49.151 --> 17:50.486
their twenties,

17:50.528 --> 17:52.112
having all sorts

17:50.528 --> 17:52.112
of casual encounters.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.114
And sometimes they

17:52.154 --> 17:54.114
even convince themselves

17:54.156 --> 17:55.700
that the relationship

17:54.156 --> 17:55.700
is serious

17:55.742 --> 17:57.493
because the sex is

17:55.742 --> 17:57.493
so great, but that...

17:57.535 --> 17:59.161
Wait. Stop.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.039
What did you mean

17:59.203 --> 18:01.039
by validation?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.498
Validating what?

18:02.540 --> 18:04.751
Well, sometimes people

18:02.540 --> 18:04.751
will attract other people

18:04.792 --> 18:07.127
just to prove to themselves

18:04.792 --> 18:07.127
that they're likable.

18:07.169 --> 18:10.130
And if that's the reason that

18:07.169 --> 18:10.130
you're having sex with someone,

18:10.172 --> 18:11.799
you can cause

18:10.172 --> 18:11.799
a lot of damage.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.133
But if you want

18:11.841 --> 18:13.133
to have sex with someone,

18:13.175 --> 18:14.134
doesn't that mean

18:13.175 --> 18:14.134
you really like them?

18:14.176 --> 18:15.553
Oh, no, honey.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.138
That's exactly the trap

18:15.595 --> 18:18.138
people fall into.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.432
You see, a lot of people...

18:19.473 --> 18:22.810
(Irish music playing,

18:19.473 --> 18:22.810
shoes tapping)

18:22.852 --> 18:25.187
(song ends)

18:29.191 --> 18:32.070
That was cool.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.196
How comes he doesn't dance

18:32.111 --> 18:34.196
as fast as you?

18:37.825 --> 18:39.660
I'm sorry.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.871
I'm sorry I said

18:39.702 --> 18:41.871
anything before.

18:41.913 --> 18:43.163
Mm-hmm!

18:43.205 --> 18:44.164
This is our shot!

18:44.206 --> 18:45.875
We can't blow it like this.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.543
The whole point of

18:45.917 --> 18:47.543
the Gentlemen Callers

18:47.585 --> 18:50.170
was to have fun and help

18:47.585 --> 18:50.170
Malik tone down his drinking.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.547
We're friends!

18:51.589 --> 18:53.173
I don't even know

18:51.589 --> 18:53.173
why we're fighting.

18:53.215 --> 18:56.427
(angry shouting)

18:56.469 --> 18:58.554
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:56.469 --> 18:58.554
I'd like to introduce an act

18:58.596 --> 19:00.473
we haven't seen before

18:58.596 --> 19:00.473
at the Founders Dinner.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.182
(moaning murmurs)

19:02.224 --> 19:03.559
Simmer down.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.185
Now let's give a warm welcome

19:05.227 --> 19:07.187
to the Gentlemen Callers!

19:07.229 --> 19:09.440
(applause)

19:13.152 --> 19:16.447
Well, I for one,  am

19:13.152 --> 19:16.447
a Gentleman Caller.

19:18.282 --> 19:22.120
Uh, well, th-thank you,

19:18.282 --> 19:22.120
ladies and gentlemen.

19:22.161 --> 19:26.206
The six of us couldn't be

19:22.161 --> 19:26.206
more honored to be here,

19:26.248 --> 19:28.793
and we're going to sing

19:26.248 --> 19:28.793
a little song about brotherhood.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.336
And forgiveness.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.923
And friendship.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.771
(crowd murmuring)

19:53.943 --> 19:56.070

20:47.413 --> 20:50.290
(laughing):

20:47.413 --> 20:50.290
They loved us!

20:50.332 --> 20:52.085
We got more applause

20:50.332 --> 20:52.085
that the Whistling Whittlers!

20:52.126 --> 20:53.293
Yeah.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.295
Now everyone over to my house

20:53.335 --> 20:55.295
for pizza!

20:55.337 --> 20:56.797
(all cheering)

20:56.839 --> 20:59.258
How come you always go

20:56.839 --> 20:59.258
to his house?

21:01.343 --> 21:03.137
Sometimes after a fight,

21:03.179 --> 21:05.305
you feel closer than you feel

21:03.179 --> 21:05.305
when you're getting along.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.183
Can I ask you something else?

21:07.225 --> 21:08.684
Sure.

21:08.726 --> 21:11.187
Well, sometimes when I'm with

21:08.726 --> 21:11.187
Nicki, I have this feeling

21:11.229 --> 21:12.897
that she wants to be doing

21:11.229 --> 21:12.897
something else,

21:12.939 --> 21:14.148
but I don't know what it is.

21:14.190 --> 21:15.399
Then I try to guess.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.317
Oh, that's never good.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.317
Yeah, suddenly it's like

21:17.359 --> 21:19.195
I did something wrong,

21:17.359 --> 21:19.195
but I was just trying to help.

21:19.237 --> 21:20.529
I mean, what am I supposed

21:19.237 --> 21:20.529
to do? Just sit there...
