WEBVTT

00:04.960 --> 00:06.840
you've had a crutch to lean on.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.160
I swear in the name
of Almighty God,

00:09.160 --> 00:11.480
I will take revenge on
Tommy Shelby.

00:11.480 --> 00:14.320
That, my friend,
is the finest opium in the world.

00:14.320 --> 00:17.920
Perhaps we can meet after you've
spoken with your wife's uncle,
Jack Nelson.

00:17.920 --> 00:20.640
Tommy Shelby wants
to do business with Jack Nelson?

00:20.640 --> 00:22.680
So, speak to your uncle
and get me out of here.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.320
If he doesn't want to buy my opium,

00:24.320 --> 00:26.360
I will sell to the
East Boston Jews.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.200
It's Ruby. She's not well.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.320
I'm coming home.

00:29.320 --> 00:35.200
This programme contains
strong language

00:35.200 --> 00:39.480
There will be a war in this
family and one of you will die.

00:41.160 --> 00:44.480
You've been too busy to
punish the people that killed her.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.200
How is the family?

00:57.520 --> 00:58.680
Daddy.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.440
Hello, Ruby.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.000
Come here.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.080
Let me see you.

01:09.240 --> 01:12.200
I missed you. I missed you.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.960
That is a Black Madonna.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.760
What presents did you get us, Dad?

01:16.760 --> 01:18.200
Son.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.760
She's all better, Tommy.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.160
You came back for nothing.

01:25.400 --> 01:26.880
But I'm glad you're back.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.920
Right, before we do anything else,

01:30.920 --> 01:33.400
we're going to go for a drive, OK?

01:33.400 --> 01:34.920
Let's go. What about me?

01:34.920 --> 01:36.440
Yeah, you can come too, come on.

01:36.440 --> 01:38.320
A drive where?

01:38.320 --> 01:40.960
I've asked the driver to take
us to see Dr Robert.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.640
I want him to have a look at Ruby.
Why, love?

01:43.640 --> 01:46.840
The appointment is in one hour,
you can stay here or you can come.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.040
Right.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.920
Right, let's go.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.560
TOMMY GRUNTS AND RETCHES

02:33.560 --> 02:36.280
HE COUGHS

02:41.920 --> 02:43.760
Tommy?

02:43.760 --> 02:44.960
Yeah?

02:47.160 --> 02:49.360
It was all good.
Everything was clear.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.120
That is a relief.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.960
That's a relief.
Yeah.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.400
Driver's bringing the car round.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.840
TAP ON WINDOW
Daddy.

03:00.440 --> 03:01.680
Hiya.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.000
Come here.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.920
When did you last sleep?

03:16.040 --> 03:18.280
Not much since we last spoke
on the phone.

03:19.320 --> 03:22.560
Well, now you know Ruby's all clear,
you can sleep.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.120
Yeah.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.680
Lizzie, I am very happy that
Ruby's results are clear.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.120
But still you won't sleep.

03:32.800 --> 03:36.160
I will speak to Johnny
and I will speak to Esmeralda.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.240
LIZZIE SIGHS

03:41.880 --> 03:43.160
We could be on holiday.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.040
We could be up a mountain
in America.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.840
That wouldn't have been possible.

03:49.880 --> 03:53.720
The man I'm dealing with is coming
to London. I need to be there.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.360
No escape.

03:58.040 --> 04:01.800
We will escape, Lizzie.
One last deal to be done.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.880
It'll be difficult.
Difficulties are to be expected.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.840
This is why I must move
from item to item.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.080
Do you feel that?

04:15.280 --> 04:16.680
Do you feel anything?

04:18.040 --> 04:21.640
You know, you talk as if you're
watching everything on a screen.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.800
When we go home. When we go home,

04:27.800 --> 04:31.000
we'll give the kids to Frances,
and then you and me will go to bed.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.840
And I will be the next item.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.840
That's how it feels now, Tommy.
Yeah.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.080
Everything on a list.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.200
Hey, baby.
When are we going home?

04:53.320 --> 04:55.240
THUNDER ROARS

04:57.120 --> 05:00.320
LOUD THUD
GLASS SHATTERS

05:08.200 --> 05:10.400
Tommy? Tommy?

05:11.800 --> 05:14.040
MEN GRUNT

05:18.160 --> 05:20.600
DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS

05:22.960 --> 05:25.240
Tommy? What's happened?

05:26.360 --> 05:27.800
Fuck, fuck.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.120
Fuck.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.760
Tommy. Come here. Come here.

05:33.760 --> 05:34.960
What's happened?

05:37.480 --> 05:38.760
Tommy.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.640
MUSIC STOPS

05:43.640 --> 05:45.600
TOMMY BREATHES

06:01.160 --> 06:02.400
It is four years...

06:04.360 --> 06:06.120
..one month and six days

06:06.120 --> 06:07.320
since I had a drink.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.000
My head is clear.

06:12.480 --> 06:13.920
I am myself.

06:16.480 --> 06:17.680
Is this the first time?

06:20.080 --> 06:22.480
Once on the ship back. Not as bad.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.400
Tommy...

06:27.960 --> 06:29.480
..you need to see a doctor.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.080
I've work to do.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.200
It's the work that's to blame.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.120
The people you meet,
the lies that you tell.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.920
We're going to keep going till
the Boston business is done.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.240
Then we rest.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.960
Then we Peaky Blinders fucking rest.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.840
Comrades, before we
end this planning meeting

06:59.840 --> 07:02.240
and send you out into the rain...
LIGHT CHUCKLES

07:02.240 --> 07:03.680
..we have a surprise.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.320
He just arrived back from
a trade mission to America.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.680
He came back early

07:09.680 --> 07:12.920
and he has insisted on addressing
you volunteers in person.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.680
Comrades,

07:15.680 --> 07:17.880
your Labour representative
for South Birmingham,

07:17.880 --> 07:20.480
Mr Thomas Shelby MP, OBE.
RAUCOUS CHEERING

07:44.920 --> 07:49.320
I bring with me on
the train from London...

07:50.480 --> 07:52.840
..a message from Westminster.

07:54.440 --> 07:57.920
No. No, no, no, not a message.

07:57.920 --> 07:58.960
Not a message.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.640
An instruction, in fact.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.880
CROWD MURMURS

08:04.880 --> 08:08.520
You must be silent.
CROWD MUMBLES IN DISAGREEMENT

08:11.200 --> 08:12.720
You must say nothing.

08:14.760 --> 08:18.120
Say nothing about the present
situation in this city.

08:20.040 --> 08:22.040
Say nothing about hunger.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.120
Say nothing about jobs.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.640
Say nothing about pay.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.520
But those in greener pastures,

08:29.520 --> 08:32.640
they may speak.
CROWD MURMURS

08:32.640 --> 08:35.560
They may raise their voices.
CROWD YELLS INDISTINCTLY

08:35.560 --> 08:38.120
But here in the smoke,
you men and women,

08:38.120 --> 08:39.920
Irish and Italian

08:39.920 --> 08:43.080
and English who support
the Socialist cause...

08:44.120 --> 08:46.440
And even your socialist cats and
dogs and canaries.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.600
CROWD LAUGHS

08:48.600 --> 08:50.760
..you must hush.

08:50.760 --> 08:55.560
Because the King, and all the King's
horses and all the King's men...

08:55.560 --> 08:57.080
CROWD CHUCKLES

08:57.080 --> 08:59.280
..want you to be silent.

08:59.280 --> 09:02.240
But it is you, my friends,
who must suffer

09:02.240 --> 09:06.080
the cuts in wages and
in welfare and in dignity.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.840
And you must not complain,

09:07.840 --> 09:10.440
because that would be unpatriotic.

09:10.440 --> 09:13.560
You soldiers,
who have fought in France,

09:13.560 --> 09:15.760
you are traitors if you speak up.

09:15.760 --> 09:20.240
You veterans of their wars
and their booms and their busts,

09:20.240 --> 09:22.560
it is you who must take the blows,

09:22.560 --> 09:25.800
and carry the burdens
for the sake of those

09:25.800 --> 09:28.200
in greener pastures who
bellow at you...

09:28.200 --> 09:30.280
HE SLAMS HAND

09:30.280 --> 09:31.560
.."Silence".

09:31.560 --> 09:33.480
CROWD YELLS IN DISSENT

09:33.480 --> 09:35.320
Well, watch this, comrades.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.960
I will not be silent.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.600
Not this Englishman.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.520
CROWD CHEERS

09:47.320 --> 09:49.160
No silence from me.

09:49.160 --> 09:51.080
No silence from me,

09:51.080 --> 09:54.760
because I have heard your voices
when you come to me

09:54.760 --> 09:58.200
and tell me about
the cries of your hungry children,

09:58.200 --> 10:02.160
and I will gather up every
single one of those cries

10:02.160 --> 10:06.160
and I will take 'em with me
on the train to Westminster...

10:06.160 --> 10:08.080
CROWD CHEERS

10:08.080 --> 10:10.480
..and I will let them out
of the bag in the House of Commons,

10:10.480 --> 10:12.560
and let them
try to silence that, eh?

10:12.560 --> 10:14.440
CROWD CHEERS

10:25.160 --> 10:27.120
TOMMY SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY

10:29.600 --> 10:32.520
Shouldn't that involve
some sharing of the burden?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.360
All of us taking
a smaller slice of the cake, eh?

10:37.520 --> 10:40.280
After all, it's bloody us
who bakes the cake

10:40.280 --> 10:43.920
and makes the cars
and melts the metal.

10:43.920 --> 10:46.840
And the King, remember him,

10:46.840 --> 10:49.560
the man who ordered all of this,

10:49.560 --> 10:52.640
shouldn't he be taking
some of the cuts?

10:52.640 --> 10:54.560
Eh, some of the blows?

10:54.560 --> 10:57.440
Some of the pain? No or yes?

10:57.440 --> 10:59.160
YES!

11:10.000 --> 11:11.520
Hush.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.000
Hush, you working men and women.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.320
Silence.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.960
Good.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.280
Save your voices.

11:22.960 --> 11:27.000
You are going to need them on
Saturday when we rally together

11:27.000 --> 11:28.880
at the Bull Ring Market...

11:28.880 --> 11:30.320
CROWD CHEERS

11:30.320 --> 11:32.640
..and together,
we'll raise the roof,

11:32.640 --> 11:34.760
we'll break the damned silence...

11:37.280 --> 11:39.280
..and bring down this broken
government.

11:39.280 --> 11:41.680
CROWD CHEERS RAUCOUSLY

11:45.720 --> 11:47.840
Tommy, Tommy.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.840
Tommy, Tommy...

11:56.080 --> 11:57.120
Thank you.

11:59.680 --> 12:00.920
Laura McKee.

12:02.280 --> 12:05.480
Battalion Commander, Fermanagh IRA.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.760
You missed the first
and second act.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.320
Thank you for coming, Mr Shelby.

12:09.320 --> 12:10.640
Thank you. Thank you.

12:10.640 --> 12:11.920
The third act was enough.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.960
You both have reasons to hate me

12:16.960 --> 12:19.160
and to want to seek revenge
for the killing of...

12:19.160 --> 12:20.360
Sh.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.360
Gypsy tradition.

12:25.120 --> 12:29.400
We do not mention the name of
the dead in company.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.280
Laura McKee,

12:36.280 --> 12:38.080
in the Shelby family,

12:38.080 --> 12:41.560
business comes before issues
of vengeance.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.640
Our beloved departed would
understand and approve.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.120
Let's go, boys.

12:48.120 --> 12:50.440
Our agreement was we meet
in a crowded place.

12:50.440 --> 12:51.640
No need for crowds.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.040
We need you alive.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.560
After you.

13:21.840 --> 13:26.120
You know, Mr Shelby,
even though we've been doing
business for a while,

13:26.120 --> 13:27.920
we've never met in person.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.320
You spoke with passion
and compassion.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.600
You understand forgiveness

13:37.600 --> 13:39.200
and you drink water.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.120
Yet I heard from many reliable
sources

13:44.120 --> 13:48.040
that you have a reputation
for moral turpitude.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.280
TOMMY SNIFFS

13:51.280 --> 13:52.640
"Moral turpitude".

13:54.560 --> 13:56.200
It's a good name for a racehorse.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.720
You don't know what it means?

13:58.720 --> 14:00.840
I know what it means.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.400
It means you fuck people.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.440
Fuck people over. Don't give a fuck.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.040
It means you covet and steal

14:08.040 --> 14:11.080
and burn all principles
for the sake of self-interest.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.280
Well, I'm changing, Laura McKee,

14:16.280 --> 14:18.400
and my organisation
is also changing.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.000
So, what happened in Boston?

14:26.400 --> 14:28.480
Jack Nelson said no.

14:28.480 --> 14:31.440
Are we accepting "no" as an answer?

14:33.240 --> 14:36.560
These are letters written to

14:36.560 --> 14:39.240
and by Jack Nelson
over the last three months.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.320
TRAIN RUMBLES PAST

14:52.640 --> 14:53.760
This...

14:54.880 --> 14:58.160
This is a private letter from
the President of the United States.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.080
Where the fuck did you get this?

15:02.120 --> 15:04.600
My racehorse, Moral Turpitude,

15:04.600 --> 15:06.360
is just one of many in my stables.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.400
Sometimes even now I'll
take her out for a run,

15:10.400 --> 15:13.080
if there is a good cause that
requires her services.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.560
Jack Nelson's coming to London.

15:20.560 --> 15:24.800
Officially, he's coming
to buy liquor import licenses.

15:24.800 --> 15:28.600
Unofficially, he's on
a fact-finding mission.

15:28.600 --> 15:32.480
He's come to measure the strength of
support for fascism in Britain.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.320
He'll report back to the President.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.680
And how does that help us?

15:42.080 --> 15:44.200
In this letter to his son,

15:44.200 --> 15:47.920
Jack Nelson expresses
strong support for fascism.

15:47.920 --> 15:51.640
In this letter to a friend
in Berlin,

15:51.640 --> 15:55.640
he says some, erm,
interesting things about Jews.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.680
He's not coming to Europe
to find facts.

16:00.680 --> 16:03.360
He's coming to find proof
that fascism will prevail.

16:05.160 --> 16:08.840
And you and I are going
to help him in that task.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.040
I thought you were a socialist.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.400
Well...

16:20.400 --> 16:21.680
..since I've entered politics,

16:21.680 --> 16:24.200
I've learned that
the line doesn't go out from

16:24.200 --> 16:26.280
the middle to the left
and the right.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.880
It goes in a circle.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.120
I'll show you.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.920
You go far enough left,

16:35.920 --> 16:39.280
eventually you'll meet someone
who has gone far enough right

16:39.280 --> 16:40.920
to get to the same place.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.520
Working-class socialists like me,

16:45.520 --> 16:47.680
working-class nationalists like you.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.080
The result?

16:49.080 --> 16:50.680
National Socialism.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.040
And that's me,

16:55.040 --> 16:56.880
in the middle.

16:58.720 --> 17:02.720
Just a man trying to make an honest
living in a very dark world.

17:07.240 --> 17:10.120
You have friends in Dublin,
Laura McKee,

17:10.120 --> 17:13.360
who are actively fighting for
a Fascist Ireland.

17:13.360 --> 17:16.560
And you are acting on their behalf,
ain't you?

17:18.440 --> 17:21.520
When Jack Nelson comes to London,

17:21.520 --> 17:25.200
I can give him access
to Oswald Mosley

17:25.200 --> 17:28.720
and to Fascist sympathisers
in the House of Commons

17:28.720 --> 17:31.280
and the House of Lords,
on both sides of the divide.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.440
Fascism is quite the thing...

17:36.400 --> 17:37.920
..among the very best people.

17:39.560 --> 17:43.120
And with your help,
I can also offer him Dublin.

17:47.240 --> 17:51.680
And you think this will allow us
to ship our merchandise to Boston?

17:51.680 --> 17:53.480
Perhaps.

17:53.480 --> 17:56.920
There may be other
benefits for your cause.

17:58.080 --> 18:01.920
All you have to do
is sit with Jack Nelson

18:01.920 --> 18:05.200
and talk to him about a new
"golden age"

18:05.200 --> 18:07.800
and let him put a pin in
the map of Ireland

18:07.800 --> 18:09.760
for the President
of the United States.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.280
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

18:20.320 --> 18:22.600
I came to collect
Arthur and put him to bed.

18:23.920 --> 18:26.840
I found him in the Garrison Lane
with a syringe in his hand.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.800
TOMMY SIGHS

18:32.720 --> 18:34.760
A friend loves at all times...

18:36.160 --> 18:39.240
..but a brother is born
for adversity.

18:39.240 --> 18:40.840
Proverbs 17, 17.

18:44.080 --> 18:48.000
I have two brothers in need,
but yours is the more urgent, Tommy.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.120
Will you come with me?

18:52.280 --> 18:53.640
So, Laura McKee...

18:54.960 --> 18:57.040
..are you going to help me
change the world?

18:59.320 --> 19:03.440
Mr Shelby, this meeting
is not what I expected.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.480
Never is.

19:05.480 --> 19:06.720
Is that a yes or a no?

19:09.520 --> 19:10.920
My answer's yes.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.520
The answer's always yes.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.720
The back door is unlocked.
You can let yourself out.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.000
And tell your friends back home,

19:23.000 --> 19:24.800
Tommy Shelby has changed.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.840
Where is he?

19:32.840 --> 19:34.720
When I found him,
the syringe was empty.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.680
He was sleeping it off
on the cobbles.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.240
Shit, Tommy. Shit.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.760
It's all under control, Ada.

19:40.760 --> 19:43.000
Well, I'm not under fucking control.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.720
I'm not you, Tommy,
and I'm not Polly either.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.280
Even though I'm trying to be.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.640
She would have stopped this.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.400
We will pull Arthur through this.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.880
I'm not talking about Arthur,
I'm talking about you.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.800
I heard everything
you were saying in there.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.440
Ada, this will be the end of it,
do you hear me?

20:00.440 --> 20:02.000
This is the way out for all of us.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.640
And along the way,
I will be doing good.

20:03.640 --> 20:06.480
No, along the way,
you're going to make yourself
a lot of fucking money.

20:06.480 --> 20:08.120
All right, fair enough.

20:08.120 --> 20:11.240
Any incidental rewards
for my good work will be welcome.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.440
But you will get
your fair share, sister.
SHE SCOFFS

20:13.440 --> 20:16.040
And by being among the Fascists,
by being among 'em,

20:16.040 --> 20:18.480
I can undermine them.

20:18.480 --> 20:19.880
Polly would approve.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.480
Beneath all the gold and diamonds,
and fucking,

20:23.480 --> 20:25.240
fucking mink and lace,

20:25.240 --> 20:26.600
she was a solid Socialist.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.480
TRAIN RUMBLES OVERHEAD

20:32.840 --> 20:35.320
Look, I know it's too late for this,
Tom, but...

20:37.000 --> 20:38.960
..this doorway,

20:38.960 --> 20:40.480
this same fucking doorway.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.720
We used to come here for Dad's beer

20:44.720 --> 20:47.440
and we were so little it took two
of us carry one bucket.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.160
Yeah, I remember.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.920
Look at us now, eh?

20:57.920 --> 20:59.240
Yeah.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.320
Fucking look at us.

21:01.320 --> 21:02.840
Take a good look, Tom,

21:02.840 --> 21:05.960
cos one of us isn't going
to be here for long.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.520
Fuck, opium and presidents!

21:15.480 --> 21:19.320
Ada, if you don't want
to help me carry the bucket...

21:21.880 --> 21:23.360
..then I wouldn't blame you.

21:25.720 --> 21:27.320
But this is my mission.

21:28.840 --> 21:30.440
And I will have no limitations.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.400
Where are you, Tom?

21:36.920 --> 21:38.640
Hm?

21:38.640 --> 21:39.680
My big brother?

21:42.320 --> 21:44.640
You know you used
to stop sometimes and laugh.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.240
Do you even remember this place?

21:50.320 --> 21:54.240
You walk into the Garrison like a
stranger and you sip fucking water.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.000
But I'm alive, Ada.

22:02.760 --> 22:04.600
Yeah.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.640
And you're still looking for trouble
big enough to kill you.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.080
Well...

22:13.160 --> 22:14.880
..I think you might have found it.

22:18.040 --> 22:19.840
I have a child, Tommy.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.760
You have to carry
this bucket on your own.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.520
One brother half-dead in
the rain in Garrison Alley

22:30.520 --> 22:32.840
and the other has no limitations.

23:00.880 --> 23:05.720
Nessun Dorma
By Puccini

23:05.720 --> 23:07.240
I'm expected.

23:26.560 --> 23:29.400
Oh, and Mr Solomons
no longer tolerates

23:29.400 --> 23:31.760
the smoking of tobacco
in his presence.

24:15.920 --> 24:20.800
I always thought that opera was just
fat people fucking shouting.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.520
Yeah. What do you think now?

24:27.280 --> 24:29.960
I think the sound of a tenor
in full passion

24:29.960 --> 24:33.920
reminds me of the crying
out of Italian soldiers

24:33.920 --> 24:35.800
when they had my bayonet
inside them.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.040
Ever since my own death,
I have been somewhat haunted by it.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.040
Dear me.

24:47.160 --> 24:50.480
But instead of fighting
these voices, I decided

24:50.480 --> 24:54.240
to write their songs down, y'know,
turn them into an opera of my own.

24:54.240 --> 24:55.920
Do not light that.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.520
No. No. Were you not told?
I have a condition.

24:59.520 --> 25:02.320
What I was told, Alfie...

25:05.080 --> 25:11.360
..is that you have withdrawn and
that you spend your days alone...

25:13.920 --> 25:16.600
..obsessing about opera singers.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.440
Opera's not fucking singing, is it?

25:20.440 --> 25:21.920
It's not singing.

25:21.920 --> 25:26.680
It is the sound that people make
before words.

25:26.680 --> 25:31.600
And I do not allow smoking because
I do need to see fucking clearly,

25:31.600 --> 25:34.200
all right?

25:39.320 --> 25:42.200
What, do you sense weakness
in the Israelite?

25:42.200 --> 25:44.880
Not a sense of weakness,
no, Alfie. Huh.

25:44.880 --> 25:47.880
A certain knowledge of it.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.480
Since you have been sat
here...writing your opera...

25:54.280 --> 25:57.440
..a member of your family has died.

25:59.080 --> 26:01.320
Charles Solomons. Your uncle.

26:01.320 --> 26:04.920
He ran all the narcotics,
bootlegging, prostitution,

26:04.920 --> 26:07.200
gambling syndicates
out of east Boston.

26:07.200 --> 26:10.600
But last January, poor old Charlie,
well...

26:11.720 --> 26:15.240
..he was shot in the Cotton Club,

26:15.240 --> 26:19.080
in the lavatory,
by men that you know.

26:19.080 --> 26:21.800
And yet you did nothing, Alfie.
LOUD CLANGING

26:27.120 --> 26:30.240
Now my opera is called America.

26:30.240 --> 26:33.840
America is my fucking masterpiece.

26:33.840 --> 26:37.360
The truth is, your uncle is dead.

26:38.760 --> 26:42.680
Boston is gone and you,

26:42.680 --> 26:46.600
once the big man
who ran Camden Town,

26:46.600 --> 26:51.560
now can't even extinguish
another man's cigarette.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.560
Let alone his fucking life.

26:56.560 --> 27:01.080
You need favours, Alfie.
I need a fucking final act, right.

27:01.080 --> 27:07.400
Just a final fucking act
for my opera. Yeah?

27:07.400 --> 27:13.200
Alfie, I think I may have written
your final act.

27:15.240 --> 27:17.880
Why don't you sit down
and have a listen, eh?

27:41.520 --> 27:48.440
I have five tonnes of pure,
refined opium

27:48.440 --> 27:51.080
sitting in one of my warehouses
in Liverpool.

27:52.200 --> 27:56.520
I have safe storage
off the coast of Canada.

27:56.520 --> 28:02.200
I have men willing
to distribute it in Toronto,

28:02.200 --> 28:04.520
Quebec, New York and Boston.

28:05.520 --> 28:09.480
The income would be immediate
and would shift the balance of power

28:09.480 --> 28:12.880
in Boston back in the favour
of the Solomons family.

28:20.720 --> 28:24.000
In the final act
that I am giving you, Alfie,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.800
it is you who takes the revenge.

28:29.200 --> 28:32.320
Why would you sell?

28:32.320 --> 28:34.160
The Irish are being difficult.

28:34.160 --> 28:36.440
The Italians are not an option.

28:36.440 --> 28:39.200
Also, Alfie, you are my friend.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.040
Pay you with credit? No.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.960
Oh. I will take property.

28:43.960 --> 28:47.240
You own half the warehouses
in Camden.

28:47.240 --> 28:50.280
I would take them and knock them
down, build houses

28:50.280 --> 28:53.360
for the needy and the deserving. Oh.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.040
ALFIE GROANS

28:59.400 --> 29:01.720
Yeah, well, the, erm...

29:01.720 --> 29:04.720
The Irish have always been
difficult, Tommy, ain't they?

29:04.720 --> 29:07.760
For about fucking 700 years.

29:07.760 --> 29:09.320
HE SNIFFS

29:09.320 --> 29:13.120
You know that I once saw
an Irishman arguing with

29:13.120 --> 29:17.280
the statue of Oliver Cromwell
in Parliament Square.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.360
The argument went on for quite
a while, actually.

29:19.360 --> 29:22.520
It went into the night and his
little voice echoed all around

29:22.520 --> 29:25.000
the Houses of Parliament
as he got more

29:25.000 --> 29:29.320
and more angered at
Oliver Cromwell's reluctance

29:29.320 --> 29:32.240
on what to answer his legitimate
questions.

29:32.240 --> 29:36.120
So angered, in fact,
that eventually he punched

29:36.120 --> 29:41.320
the statue on the nose
and broke his fucking hand.

29:43.160 --> 29:46.680
And there it is, y'know.
the Irish question, innit.

29:47.640 --> 29:52.680
How come you can remember so much
about what happened 200 years ago,

29:52.680 --> 29:56.120
but you just can't remember
what fucking happened last night?

29:58.560 --> 29:59.760
ALFIE SIGHS

30:03.200 --> 30:05.280
How much is a tonne?

30:06.920 --> 30:09.000
Johnny.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.560
Only me today.

30:15.960 --> 30:18.560
Jack says a few more weeks...

30:18.560 --> 30:20.720
KEYS JINGLE

30:22.080 --> 30:25.440
..then you'll be free.
When do you travel to London?

30:32.120 --> 30:34.520
Tomorrow.

30:34.520 --> 30:36.560
I came to say goodbye.

30:48.920 --> 30:52.600
When you go to London,
stay away from the devil.

30:53.960 --> 30:56.480
Block your fucking ears
if you have too.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.720
I will be with you, Michael.

31:00.920 --> 31:03.240
I've been thinking about you.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.000
Only you.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.520
And don't worry about Tommy Shelby.

31:16.920 --> 31:19.680
I have no interest in a dead man.

31:23.360 --> 31:25.480
Jack says he has to die.

31:25.480 --> 31:28.080
Well, you tell Jack to wait.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.080
If anyone is going to kill
Tommy Shelby...

31:30.080 --> 31:33.080
It will be you. I know.

31:34.480 --> 31:37.080
I told Jack.

31:37.080 --> 31:40.880
And Jack said,
"OK. Let the kid do it."

31:42.880 --> 31:47.240
And in return, he can collect
the cash that Tommy won't.

31:49.720 --> 31:52.800
Five million dollars.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.800
The devil will be dead.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.480
The future belongs to us.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.680
Oh, and, erm, Michael.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.640
Every night...

32:09.040 --> 32:11.440
..midnight in Boston,
5am in London...

32:13.280 --> 32:16.960
..I'll be wide awake in my big
wide bed,

32:16.960 --> 32:19.480
and you'll be wide awake
in this prison cell.

32:22.280 --> 32:26.160
And our souls will come together,
and we'll fuck.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.000
I won't need an alarm clock.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.360
And you won't sleep until I'm done.

32:34.360 --> 32:37.200
Midnight fucks 5am.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.720
Every day.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.320
Because we trust each other.

May I ask why a socialist MP
would attend a Fascist rally, sir?

Let him in,
let me answer the question.

Mr Mosley's constituency borders

We have worked together in the past.

35:14.160 --> 35:17.680
Mr Shelby, you once shared
a platform with Mr Mosley.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.200
Will you be sharing the stage
with him tonight? No.

35:20.200 --> 35:23.440
I am simply here to remind my friend
Mr Mosley

35:23.440 --> 35:26.480
that the way of the British people
is compromise.

35:26.480 --> 35:29.160

35:42.840 --> 35:45.320
Give him your condolences, will you?

35:45.320 --> 35:48.240
Tonight,
he will be with his mistress.

35:48.240 --> 35:51.400
Who is apparently
a Lady of some standing...

35:52.640 --> 35:55.840
..and has given him great comfort
in his time of grief.

35:56.960 --> 36:00.280
Fuck off, you dozy bastard!

36:00.280 --> 36:04.200

What is Arthur doing here?

36:04.200 --> 36:06.720
Mosley invited him. I agreed.

36:06.720 --> 36:10.600
Arthur made me a promise,
which he appears to have broken.

36:12.640 --> 36:14.920
Move. I said fucking move.

I tried my best.

Remember, I overruled you.

Yeah? Who to?

39:01.040 --> 39:02.560
To Linda.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.400
And in that letter I wrote,

39:07.400 --> 39:11.560
"Linda, as a Christian woman,

39:11.560 --> 39:13.280
"do you believe in forgiveness?"

39:16.600 --> 39:20.840
And this is what I got back.
Two days ago. Have a look.

39:30.800 --> 39:34.960
"As a Christian woman, I do believe
in forgiveness."

39:34.960 --> 39:37.560
Yeah, and the word "do"
is underlined.

39:41.280 --> 39:44.040
Arthur, I am no Christian.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.040
But I also believe in forgiveness.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.520
So, get yourself clean.

he bought the earrings in Paris.

43:18.240 --> 43:20.360
Mosely, I have business to discuss.

43:20.360 --> 43:23.920
Perhaps you and I could find
somewhere a bit quieter, eh?

43:23.920 --> 43:28.120
Darling, Mr Shelby just made
the astonishing suggestion

43:28.120 --> 43:30.400
that we men go off

43:34.720 --> 43:37.760
What year do you think this is,
Mr Shelby? 1807?

43:37.760 --> 43:41.520
In Birmingham, the centuries
grind by quite slowly.

43:41.520 --> 43:44.000
But, Mr Shelby, if it's business,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.360
Diana is the engine
of my enterprise.

43:46.360 --> 43:48.320
It's the modern way, Mr Shelby.

43:48.320 --> 43:51.200
Yes, we know.
I am company director.

43:51.200 --> 43:53.040
I will join the meeting as well.

But of course,
you must come as well, Elizabeth.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.560
By the way, I really don't like
"Lizzie".

43:57.560 --> 44:01.520
I prefer Liberated Elizabeth.
She must be part of this.

44:01.520 --> 44:04.880
She's been all the way to Paris, so
she is a woman of the world. Bravo.

Our friend in Berlin doesn't either.

44:27.680 --> 44:29.520
They have that in common at least.

44:29.520 --> 44:31.960
Oh, I imagine they have lots
in common.

44:34.760 --> 44:37.520
Report to me, Shelby.

44:37.520 --> 44:40.920
Officially Jack Nelson is in London
to buy import licences.

44:44.040 --> 44:47.800
And unofficially,
he's Roosevelt's envoy.

44:47.800 --> 44:51.640
Well, as you can see from this
private letter,

44:51.640 --> 44:55.120
he is far from a neutral
point of view.

44:58.400 --> 45:00.880
Look at the bottom
of the second paragraph.

45:00.880 --> 45:04.840
"Individually Jews are fine
but as a race they stink."

45:04.840 --> 45:09.120
Hm. Elizabeth, do you even know
why the bridge

45:09.120 --> 45:12.000
to President Roosevelt
is so important?

45:14.520 --> 45:17.000
Actually, no.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.040
I don't really know much about this
business at all.

45:24.160 --> 45:27.120
But I have fucked
your future husband.

45:27.120 --> 45:29.160
So, I know lots of things about him.

45:31.600 --> 45:34.680
Tommy, I'll be outside.

45:34.680 --> 45:36.600
Well done, Elizabeth.

TOMMY CLEARS THROAT

45:40.440 --> 45:44.040
Do you people want to meet Nelson
or no?

45:44.040 --> 45:47.640
Mr Shelby, from now on,
can I call you Thomas?

45:47.640 --> 45:49.200
If you like.

45:49.200 --> 45:50.680
Of course we would.

45:50.680 --> 45:53.520
And we are very grateful
for your efforts.

45:53.520 --> 45:58.320
But, Mr Shelby, before this
enterprise goes any further,

45:58.320 --> 46:01.320
you really must do
something about your wife.

46:28.840 --> 46:31.160
Mr Shelby.

46:31.160 --> 46:32.560
Yes.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.160
Mr Nelson.

46:34.160 --> 46:35.320
I came early.

46:36.760 --> 46:39.840
I wanted to come and take a look
around this beautiful church.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.040
You're Catholic, Mr Shelby.

46:45.360 --> 46:48.960
I hoped that by suggesting we meet
in church it might make us both

46:48.960 --> 46:53.400
more cautious with lies and truth.

46:53.400 --> 46:55.440
Well, your hope would be forlorn.

46:57.080 --> 47:00.520
There ain't no-one listening here.
You don't believe in God?

47:00.520 --> 47:02.240
No.

47:05.360 --> 47:07.640
It was the way Catholics were
treated in my country

47:07.640 --> 47:09.600
that made me angry.

47:10.880 --> 47:12.680
Made me what I became.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.880
What made you angry?

47:20.760 --> 47:23.720
Slowness in anything.

47:25.880 --> 47:28.840
I wanted to have everything already.

47:31.560 --> 47:34.000
Two working-class Catholic boys.

47:37.520 --> 47:40.920
Did they mess with you
when you were small?

47:40.920 --> 47:43.280
Some man in the shadows.

47:44.720 --> 47:47.240
I carried a screwdriver and a blade.

47:47.240 --> 47:50.960
And everyone believed
I had the power to lay curses.

47:50.960 --> 47:52.640
And do you?

47:52.640 --> 47:54.480
Yes, I do.

47:57.160 --> 47:59.640
First man I killed was a priest.

48:01.560 --> 48:03.920
You?

48:03.920 --> 48:08.120
A Prussian boy with green eyes,
he was already underground.

48:08.120 --> 48:10.720
When did you last kill a man,
Mr Shelby?

48:15.320 --> 48:16.720
Four years ago.

48:19.240 --> 48:22.520
His name was Tommy Shelby.

48:22.520 --> 48:23.560
He drank whisky.

48:26.480 --> 48:30.760
You want me to allow you
to enter my city

48:30.760 --> 48:33.360
and deal narcotics that will
kill people?

48:37.080 --> 48:39.960
You deal in whisky, Mr Nelson.

48:41.640 --> 48:44.680
I recently read a report
by the Vatican, actually,

48:44.680 --> 48:47.360
which said that whisky
disproportionately kills

48:47.360 --> 48:50.160
more of our Catholic brothers
and sisters,

48:50.160 --> 48:53.520
whereas opium is the sedative

48:53.520 --> 48:57.440
more often chosen
by Protestants and atheists.

49:00.080 --> 49:03.680
In return, there are people in
England who you think I should meet?

49:03.680 --> 49:06.480
Yes. Yes, like minds.

49:09.080 --> 49:12.960
I'm here to buy import licences
for booze.

49:14.840 --> 49:16.640
The booze of the blue blood elite.

49:18.120 --> 49:19.760
In America, we like...

49:19.760 --> 49:23.320
..we like labels and aspiration.

49:23.320 --> 49:27.800
Well, I have a brand of my own
vodka and gin.

49:27.800 --> 49:30.880
You can add that to your portfolio.

49:30.880 --> 49:34.280
I hear Shelby labels are favoured
by the working class.

49:34.280 --> 49:37.320
Indeed.
A fact of which I am very proud.

49:37.320 --> 49:40.800
They say you are a poet, too.

49:40.800 --> 49:43.000
No, I only read it.

49:45.040 --> 49:49.040
There are some people in this
country who I'd like to meet.

49:52.680 --> 49:53.920
Fascists.

49:53.920 --> 49:58.280
Not the ones in boots and black
shirts. The ones in tuxedos.

50:00.200 --> 50:02.800
I know men who are friends
of the cause.

50:02.800 --> 50:05.280
I also know men who are enemies
of the cause.

50:06.600 --> 50:07.840
For many years now,

50:07.840 --> 50:09.840
I have been working closely with
Winston Churchill,

50:09.840 --> 50:11.720
in many different capacities.

50:11.720 --> 50:14.040
I have his trust.

50:14.040 --> 50:16.440
He's opposed to the rise of fascism.

50:16.440 --> 50:19.360
You, I believe,
see it as inevitable.

50:21.120 --> 50:25.440
Well, I can give you men
of influence who support your cause.

50:25.440 --> 50:29.360
I can also offer you a full report
on Churchill's strategies.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.920
All this in return for access
to south Boston.

50:36.920 --> 50:38.680
Alternatively,

50:38.680 --> 50:41.200
you can take on Churchill
on your own,

50:41.200 --> 50:43.480
without my intelligence.

50:43.480 --> 50:45.960
And I can sell my opium to the Jews.

50:50.560 --> 50:52.960
You are a brave man, Mr Shelby.

50:54.520 --> 50:56.520
A war hero, I hear.

50:58.360 --> 51:00.640
Every war hero I ever met,
they're just someone

51:00.640 --> 51:02.720
who wanted to get themselves killed.

51:06.080 --> 51:08.560
Do we have a deal, Mr Nelson?

51:13.200 --> 51:16.120
I'll think a great deal about
what you've said.

51:29.560 --> 51:32.960
Ruby, have you finished
your spelling, love?

51:47.680 --> 51:49.520
Ruby?

51:50.800 --> 51:52.040
Ruby?

51:56.920 --> 51:58.840
Ruby?

52:03.040 --> 52:04.200
Ruby?

52:05.520 --> 52:07.720
What are you doing, love?

52:07.720 --> 52:10.560
I can hear voices.

52:10.560 --> 52:12.880
Coming from up the chimney.

52:16.160 --> 52:19.040
What voices? The grey man.

52:23.440 --> 52:26.560
Gentlemen, Mr Thomas Shelby.

52:26.560 --> 52:28.720
Birmingham South.

52:28.720 --> 52:31.040
THEY HECKLE

52:31.040 --> 52:32.240
Mr Speaker.

52:32.240 --> 52:33.880
I was raised in a family

52:33.880 --> 52:36.800
that endured living conditions
that would test

52:36.800 --> 52:40.040
the morality of even
the most virtuous.

52:40.040 --> 52:44.680
Indeed... Indeed, even the best of
us would have our virtues trounced

52:44.680 --> 52:47.240
and thwarted by life in the meanness

52:47.240 --> 52:50.240
and the bitterness of
an overcrowded British slum.

52:50.240 --> 52:52.680
What would you know about virtue?
THEY HECKLE

52:58.760 --> 53:01.160
Quickly, please.

53:02.600 --> 53:06.200
Therefore, Mr Speaker, I intend
to put before this House

53:06.200 --> 53:11.800
a bill which will offer radical
reform in housing in this country,

53:11.800 --> 53:15.720
in which slums are cleared
and new houses are built

53:15.720 --> 53:17.960
with new standards
in health and hygiene.

53:22.720 --> 53:26.600
Westminster 245. House of Commons.

53:30.680 --> 53:34.560
The time has come for change, the
people have had enough. They have!

53:34.560 --> 53:37.840
Let's open the windows,
let in new light,

53:37.840 --> 53:42.360
build a new Jerusalem
brick by Government-owned brick.

53:42.360 --> 53:44.640
THEY CHEER

53:48.200 --> 53:51.720
Into there.
SHE COUGHS

53:59.000 --> 54:01.320
Doctor?

54:04.360 --> 54:06.680
Yeah, Westminster 245.

54:10.880 --> 54:12.840
Mr Shelby.

54:31.480 --> 54:34.720
Tickner Maura O Beng,
O Beng over and over again.

54:34.720 --> 54:37.280
How is the family?
And one of you will die.

54:37.280 --> 54:40.840
They are staring at me, Daddy.
A man with green eyes.

54:40.840 --> 54:43.000
Can you stop the voices?

54:44.680 --> 54:47.400
There are no voices, my love.

54:47.400 --> 54:49.960
It's the grey man.

54:49.960 --> 54:52.360
He says he's coming for me...

54:53.400 --> 54:55.440
..and he's coming for Daddy as well.

55:07.640 --> 55:09.960
LOUD BLAST

55:09.960 --> 55:12.040

Tommy, she has a temperature

56:39.880 --> 56:42.400
Just get here now. Lizzie. Please.

56:42.400 --> 56:45.200
Lizzie.

56:45.200 --> 56:46.760
HE SIGHS

Where is she?
She's with the doctor upstairs.

57:12.360 --> 57:14.400
Listen, Tommy.

57:14.400 --> 57:16.880
He said we shouldn't come close
to her, in case...

57:16.880 --> 57:18.880
In case of what?

57:18.880 --> 57:20.800
When she coughs, there's blood.

57:38.640 --> 57:40.760
Madonna,

57:40.760 --> 57:45.240
put me through to the number
I gave you for Esme Shelby Lee.
