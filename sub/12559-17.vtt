EIGHT OR 12.

00:49.883 --> 00:53.126
<i>YOU WEREN'T
EVEN LISTENING.</i>

I'M SORRY, MOTHER.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.342
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
YOU, DARLING.

01:08.193 --> 01:11.311
I REMEMBER HOW EXCITED
I WAS BEFORE I WAS DONE.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.066
I COULDN'T SLEEP
FOR NIGHTS.

01:20.038 --> 01:25.909
I FINALLY CHOSE NUMBER 12.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.960

EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE.

OF YOU BEFORE.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.097
OH, DEAR.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.719
IT IS YOU,
ISN'T IT?

01:41.810 --> 01:44.893
YES, THAT'S ME BEFORE
MY TRANSFORMATION.

01:44.980 --> 01:47.312
<i>I WAS A SIGHT,
WASN'T I?</i>

01:47.399 --> 01:49.356
MOTHER, I THINK
YOU WERE BEAUTIFUL.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.309
WELL, I CERTAINLY DON'T.

01:51.403 --> 01:54.191
AM I VERY HOMELY NOW?

01:54.281 --> 01:56.989
NO, DARLING, NOT TO ME.

01:57.075 --> 02:01.319
BUT AFTERWARD,
YOU'LL BE BEAUTIFUL.

02:01.413 --> 02:04.451
MOTHER, IF I DIDN'T WANT
THE TRANSFORMATION,

02:04.541 --> 02:06.828
I WOULDN'T HAVE
TO HAVE IT, WOULD I?

02:06.918 --> 02:09.080
DARLING, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:09.170 --> 02:11.913
THE TRANSFORMATION IS
THE MOST MARVELOUS THING

02:12.007 --> 02:13.839
THAT COULD HAPPEN
TO A PERSON.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.917
WELL, I COULD WAIT
A LITTLE WHILE, COULDN'T I?

02:17.012 --> 02:20.050
DON'T WORRY, DARLING,
YOU'RE JUST NERVOUS.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.973
WHAT YOU NEED IS A
GLASS OF INSTANT SMILE.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.559

YOU PEOPLE TO USE FIRST NAMES

FOR VVANT OF A BETTER ESTIMATE,
LET'S CALL IT THE YEAR 2000.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.786
AT ANY RATE,
IMAGINE A TIME IN THE FUTURE

03:33.880 --> 03:36.713
WHEN SCIENCE HAS DEVELOPED
THE MEANS OF GIVING EVERYONE

03:36.800 --> 03:38.461
THE FACE AND BODY
HE DREAMS OF.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.088
IT MAY NOT
HAPPEN TOMORROW,

IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.168
NOW, YOUNG LADY,

04:16.255 --> 04:19.589
WHAT'S ALL THIS I'\/E
BEEN HEARING ABOUT YOU?

04:21.178 --> 04:23.419
YOU KNOW, HONEY, YOUR
MOTHER IS VERY WORRIED.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.095
I DON'T WANT
TO BE TRANSFORMED.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.638
I WANT TO STAY UGLY.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.762
OH, YOU'RE NOT UGLY,
YOU'RE JUST...

04:28.852 --> 04:30.263
NOT BEAUTIFUL.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.970
WELL, I WOULDN'T
EXACTLY SAY THAT.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.225
IT'S JUST THAT, UH...

04:38.945 --> 04:40.856
YOU'RE DIFFERENT.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.028
SIT DOWN HERE.

04:45.911 --> 04:49.950
MARILYN, YOUR FATHER
WAS TRANSFORMED.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.328
YES, NUMBER 17
JUST LIKE YOU.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.534
A VERY POPULAR
NUMBER THESE DAYS.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.621
AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT
HAS BEEN FOR 2O YEARS.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.377
HE WOULDN'T HAVE SETTLED
FOR ANYTHING LESS.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.583
BUT IS THAT GOOD?

05:02.677 --> 05:04.213
BEING LIKE EVERYBODY--

05:04.304 --> 05:08.343
ISN'T THAT THE SAME
AS BEING NOBODY?

05:08.433 --> 05:10.174
I THINK IT'S TIME
YOU TELL ME

05:10.268 --> 05:12.760
WHERE YOU'RE GETTING
THESE RADICAL IDEAS.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.185
DADDY ONCE SAID...

05:14.272 --> 05:15.774
YOUR FATHER WAS
A HANDSOME MAN.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.643
I KNOVV, BUT HE
THOUGHT ABOUT THINGS

05:17.692 --> 05:19.148
AND HE READ BOOKS.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.193
WE TALKED A LOT,
JUST THE TWO OF US.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.610
EVERYBODY TALKS.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.483
NO, I MEAN ABOUT
REAL THINGS,

05:24.574 --> 05:26.690
NOT JUST ABOUT ELECTRONIC
BASEBALL OR SUPER SOCCER

05:26.785 --> 05:28.617
AND WHERE TO BUY
YOUR CLOTHES

05:28.703 --> 05:29.909
OR HOW TO FIX
YOUR HAIR.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.407
IS THAT BAD?

05:31.498 --> 05:32.988
LIKING SPORTS,
BUYING NEW CLOTHES?

05:33.083 --> 05:34.494
NO, OF COURSE,
IT ISN'T

05:34.584 --> 05:37.451
BUT THERE'S GOT
TO BE MORE TO LIFE.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.253
YOU DON'T FEEL
VERY WELL.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.296
WHAT YOU NEED
IS A NICE CUP

05:41.383 --> 05:42.714
OF INSTANT SMILE.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.291
I HAD A CUP
OF INSTANT SMILE!

05:44.386 --> 05:46.218
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
SMILING ALL THE TIME.

05:46.304 --> 05:49.717
SOMETIMES I WANT
TO CRY OR FROWN.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.594
WHY DON'T
YOU UNDERSTAND?

05:55.063 --> 06:00.229
MARILYN, YOU ARE
A VERY SICK GIRL.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.980

06:18.795 --> 06:20.627
GOODBYE.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.375
SHE TOLD YOU,
DIDN'T SHE?

06:22.465 --> 06:24.206
YES, SHE DID.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.626
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE
BEING AWFULLY SILLY?

06:26.720 --> 06:29.007
NO. THERE'S NO LAW,
IS THERE?

06:29.097 --> 06:31.429
BUT IT ISN'T AS IF
IT HURTS OR ANYTHING.

06:31.516 --> 06:34.008
WHEN THEY DID MINE,
I DIDN'T FEEL A THING.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.719
I KNOW THAT.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.100
VVELL, YOU LIKE THE
VVAY I LOOK, DON'T YOU?

06:39.190 --> 06:41.648
I LIKE YOU, VAL,
WE'RE FRIENDS.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.772
I LIKED YOU
BEFORE THE TRANSFORMATION.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.352
BUT YOU'RE
MISSING THE POINT.

06:45.447 --> 06:46.903
IT'S LIKE GETTING
A NEW HAIRSTYLE

06:46.990 --> 06:48.446
OR NEW CLOTHES
OR SOMETHING.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.989
YOU JUST LOOK BETTER.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.817
I'LL LOOK LIKE ONE
OF THOSE DRAWINGS

ALL BEAUTIFUL.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.405
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT?

06:56.499 --> 06:58.081
IT IS WRONG, VALERIE.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.829
HOW WILL YOU KNOW ME?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.627
I MEAN, HOW WILL
ANYONE KNOW ME?

07:01.713 --> 07:03.670
I DON'T WANNA LOOK

07:03.757 --> 07:05.293
I WANT TO LOOK LIKE ME.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.560
WE HAVEN'T GIVEN HER
ANY DEFINITE REASON

WHY SHE MUST WAIT
UNTIL THE AGE OF 19.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.356
YOU SEE, SHE LOOKS
AT YOU, LANA,

08:12.450 --> 08:13.952
<i>AND THE OTHER WOMEN AROUND HER</i>

08:14.035 --> 08:17.403
AND THEN AT HERSELF
IN THE MIRROR.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.079
DOCTOR--

08:19.165 --> 08:21.827
FROM PURE PERFECTION
OF BODY, FACE, LIMB,

08:21.918 --> 08:25.752
PIGMENTATION,
STANCE, CARRIAGE,

08:25.839 --> 08:28.581
SHE LOOKS AT HERSELF
AND SHE'S HORRIFIED.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.258
ISN'T THAT SO?
OF COURSE.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.506
YOU SEE, THE POOR CHILD
SAYS TO HERSELF

08:33.554 --> 08:35.341
WHY SHOULD I
BE SO HIDEOUS?

08:35.390 --> 08:39.884
SO AWKWARD,
OVERSIZED, UNBALANCED,

08:39.977 --> 08:44.688
<i>SO FULL OF REVOLTING
SKIN ERUPTIONS, EH?</i>

08:44.733 --> 08:46.349
IN SHORT, LANA,

08:46.401 --> 08:48.688
OUR MARILYN IS TIRED
OF BEING A MONSTER.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.360
DR. REX, YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

08:50.405 --> 08:51.440
WHAT'S THAT?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.067
SHE ISN'T ANXIOUS.

08:53.158 --> 08:54.774
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
THE TRANSFORMATION.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.779
YOU WHAT?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.702
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.613
SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT IT BEFORE.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.414
IS THIS TRUE?

09:02.500 --> 09:04.036
YES.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.621
<i>SHE DOESN'T
GIVE ANY REASONS.</i>

09:05.712 --> 09:08.124
YES, YES.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.205
NOW, MARILYN,

09:10.258 --> 09:12.465
SUPPOSE YOU TELL ME
ALL ABOUT IT,

09:12.552 --> 09:13.792
IN YOUR OWN WORDS.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.762
I DON'T KNOW.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.307
IJUST DON'T
WANT THE CHANGE.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.636
YOU UNDERSTAND, OF COURSE,
THAT THE TRANSFORMATION

09:23.730 --> 09:25.892
HAS BECOME A NORMAL
PART OF GROWING UP.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.396
IT'S A SIGN OF MATURITY.

09:27.484 --> 09:30.567
WHAT, BEING LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE?

09:30.653 --> 09:33.315
MARILYN...

09:36.451 --> 09:39.409
VVOULD YOU MIND IF I CONDUCTED
AN EXPERIMENT VVITH YOU?

09:49.130 --> 09:51.087
SIT RIGHT DOWN
HERE, PLEASE.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.752
NOVV, MARILYN, YOU
MUST TRY TO UNDERSTAND

09:56.805 --> 09:59.092
THE TRANSFORMATION IS
NOT MERELY DESIRABLE

09:59.182 --> 10:01.014
FROM AN AESTHETIC
POINT OF VIEW.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.183
BUT EXPERIENCE
HAS SHOWN US

10:03.269 --> 10:05.010
THAT IT PLAYS A
VERY IMPORTANT ROLE

10:05.105 --> 10:06.766
IN PSYCHOLOGICAL
ADJUSTMENT.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.642
NOW JUST HOLD YOUR HEAD
VERY STILL, PLEASE.

10:08.733 --> 10:09.973
THIS WON'T HURT A BIT.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.354
THERE WE ARE.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.280
<i>[whirring]</i>

10:29.379 --> 10:31.086

YES.

10:46.354 --> 10:51.315

TRIGGERED THIS RESENTMENT?

10:51.401 --> 10:52.983
I CAN'T IMAGINE.

10:53.069 --> 10:56.653
(Lana) SHE'S NEVER
SHOWN MUCH INTEREST.

11:00.243 --> 11:04.487
BUT IT NEVER
OCCURRED TO ME.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.993
I SEE THAT
YOUR HUSBAND DIED

11:07.041 --> 11:08.873
IN THE
GANYMEDE INCIDENT.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.416
FIVE YEARS AGO.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.541
DID YOU AND HE EVER
HAVE AN OCCASION

11:13.631 --> 11:15.497
TO DISCUSS THIS MATTER
BETWEEN YOURSELVES?

11:15.592 --> 11:18.584
YES, HE WAS OPPOSED
TO IT AT FIRST.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.420
BUT HE FINALLY CHOSE
NUMBER 17, YOUR NUMBER.

11:21.514 --> 11:25.257
AH, I SEE.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.012
MARILYN, YOU CAN
COME OVER HERE NOW.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.348
WE'RE QUITE FINISHED.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.193
NOW, MARILYN, I TAKE IT

11:37.280 --> 11:40.272
THAT YOU VVERE QUITE
FOND OF YOUR FATHER.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.073
YES.

11:42.160 --> 11:45.698
<i>AND YOU NO DOUBT
RESPECTED HIS OPINIONS.</i>

11:45.788 --> 11:49.782
DID HE E\/ER SAY TO YOU THAT
THE TRANSFORMATION VVAS BAD?

11:49.876 --> 11:52.413
NO, NOT EXACTLY.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.119
WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU?

11:54.214 --> 11:58.959
HE SAID... HE THOUGHT
IT WAS TRAGIC.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.295
MY HUSBAND HAD SOME RATHER
NONCONFORMIST IDEAS,

12:02.388 --> 12:04.174
BUT IT WAS JUST TALK.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.973
HE HAD THE HIGHEST PHYSICAL
AND PSYCHOLOGICAL RATING

12:07.060 --> 12:08.300
WITH THE ROCKET SERVICE.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.307
YES, YES.

12:11.397 --> 12:15.891
LANA, THIS CASE
IS EXTREMELY UNUSUAL.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.397
I'M AFRAID THAT I SHALL
REQUIRE MORE TIME

12:18.446 --> 12:20.062
TO EXAMINE THE
MATTER FURTHER.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.272
SUPPOSE I GET
IN TOUCH WITH YOU?

12:22.367 --> 12:24.074
YOU FIND OUT
WHAT'S IN THERE?

12:24.160 --> 12:25.662
WHAT'S THAT?

12:25.745 --> 12:28.783
DID YOU FIND OUT
WHAT'S INSIDE OF ME?

12:28.873 --> 12:31.080
YES, INDEED.

12:31.167 --> 12:37.459
YOUR GENERAL INTELLIGENCE
RATING IS QUITE HIGH.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.836
YOUR SOCIAL
ADAPTABILITY IS GOOD.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.964
YOUR POVVERS OF
REASONING, QUITE NORMAL.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.011
THEN VVHY CAN'T I
MAKE UP MY OVVN MIND?

12:45.098 --> 12:47.180
MARILYN, PLEASE.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.759
VVHY ARE YOU GONNA FORCE ME TO DO
SOMETHING I DON'T VVANT TO DO?

12:49.852 --> 12:51.980
YOU CAN'T <i>MAKE</i> ME
DO IT, CAN YOU?

12:52.063 --> 12:55.021
NOBODY CAN
<i>MAKE</i> ME DO IT.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.351
NOW, NOW,
MY DEAR CHILD.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.105
NO ONE HAS EVER
BEEN FORCED

13:00.196 --> 13:03.939
TO TAKE TRANSFORMATION
IF HE DIDN'T VVANT IT.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.448
YOU SEE, THE
PROBLEM IS SIMPLY

13:05.535 --> 13:08.027
TO DISCOVER WHY
YOU DON'T WANT IT

13:08.121 --> 13:11.330
AND THEN TO MAKE THE
NECESSARY CORRECTION.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.387
RIGHT IN
HERE, PLEASE.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.392
WHAT PLACE IS THIS?

13:40.903 --> 13:42.689
MARILYN CUBERLE.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.786
(man, German accent) COME
IN AND SIT DOWN, PLEASE.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.500
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE FRIGHTENED OF.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.597
WHO ARE YOU?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.011
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.

14:16.731 --> 14:21.350
I AM PROFESSOR FRIEND,
SIGMUND FRIEND.

14:21.444 --> 14:25.187
YOU MUST CALL ME
PROFESSOR SIG.

14:25.239 --> 14:29.528
DR. REX HAS TOLD ME
ABOUT YOU.

14:29.577 --> 14:30.783
I AM HERE TO HELP YOU.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.281
HELP ME?

14:32.372 --> 14:33.862
TO HELP RID YOU
OF THESE FEARS

14:33.956 --> 14:35.742
OF THIS NECESSARY
AND IMPORTANT...

14:35.833 --> 14:38.291
THAT ISN'T TRUE.
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARY.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.745
[laughing]

14:40.838 --> 14:42.215
THIS IS VERY NECESSARY,

14:42.298 --> 14:44.255
VERY IMPORTANT STEP
IN YOUR LIFE.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.253
WHY DOES EVERYONE
WANT TO FORCE ME TO DO

14:46.344 --> 14:47.630
SOMETHING I DON'T
WANT TO DO?

14:47.720 --> 14:49.882
BUT FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.929
WHY ELSE?

14:52.016 --> 14:56.135
VVHY ELSE VVOULD THE STATE GO
TO SUCH TROUBLE AND EXPENSE?

14:56.229 --> 14:59.392
MANY YEARS AGO,
WISER MEN THAN I

14:59.482 --> 15:01.564
DECIDED TO TRY AND
ELIMINATE THE REASONS

15:01.651 --> 15:05.986
FOR INEQUALITY AND INJUSTICE
IN THIS VVORLD OF OURS.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.814
THEY SAW IN PHYSICAL
UNATTRACTIVENESS

15:08.908 --> 15:11.900
ONE OF THE FACTORS
WHICH MADE MEN HATE.

15:11.953 --> 15:15.662
SO, THEY CHARGED
THE FINEST SCIENTIFIC MINDS

15:15.748 --> 15:19.992
VVITH THE TASK OF ELIMINATING
UGLINESS IN MANKIND.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.827
BUT I'M NOT UGLY.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.083
I'M NOT PRETTY,
BUT I'M NOT UGLY.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.335
[laughing]

15:26.426 --> 15:28.258
BUT TO OTHERS YOU ARE.

15:28.344 --> 15:31.928
NOT TO PEOPLE
WHO LOVE ME.

15:32.014 --> 15:35.302
THERE IS MORE TO IT
THAN THAT, OF COURSE.

15:35.393 --> 15:39.853
AS VVE LEARNED TO RESHAPE THE
FEATURES, REMOLD THE BODY,

15:39.939 --> 15:43.307
VVE ALSO LEARNED TO ELIMINATE
MOST OF THE CAUSES OF ILLNESS

15:43.401 --> 15:45.984
AND THUS TO PROLONG LIFE.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.357
BEFORE THE TRANSFORMATION,

15:48.448 --> 15:53.363
YOU COULD HA\/E EXPECTED TO
Ll\/E 70, 80, PERHAPS 9O YEARS.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.865
BUT NOW YOU CAN LIVE
TWICE THAT LONG.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.196
<i>PERHAPS THREE TIMES.</i>

15:58.291 --> 16:00.453
<i>THIS IS A GOOD
THING, IS IT NOT?</i>

16:00.543 --> 16:02.204
YES, B--

16:02.295 --> 16:06.129
YOUR MOTHER, AH, SHE
IS LOVELY, IS SHE NOT?

16:06.174 --> 16:08.836
<i>AT ONE TIME,
HER BODY, HER FACE,</i>

16:08.926 --> 16:11.384
<i>MIGHT ALREADY BE
SHOWING SIGNS OF AGE,</i>

16:11.471 --> 16:14.338
OF--DECAY.

16:14.432 --> 16:17.220
<i>YOU WOULD NOT DENY YOUR
MOTHER HER YOUTH, WOULD YOU'?</i>

16:17.310 --> 16:20.473
BUT YOU COULD DO THAT
ANYVVAY, COULDN'T YOU?

16:20.521 --> 16:22.307
KEEP ME YOUNG
WITHOUT CHANGING ME.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.809
LWOULDN'T MIND
JUST THAT.

16:23.900 --> 16:27.985
[laughing]

16:28.029 --> 16:31.147
BUT SOMEDAY YOU MIGHT

16:31.199 --> 16:33.281
AND THAT WOULD
BE TOO LATE.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.745
YOU SEE, THE TRANSFORMATION
MUST BE PERFORMED

16:35.828 --> 16:37.910
VVHEN THE BODY AND THE TISSUE
ARE AT THE PROPER STATE.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.364
NO, I'LL NEVER
CHANGE MY MIND.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.244
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT
AND I NEVER WILL.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.248
WHY?

16:45.338 --> 16:47.875
HAVE YOU EVER
READ SHAKESPEARE?

16:47.965 --> 16:49.831
WHO?

16:49.926 --> 16:51.758
OR KEATS OR SHELLEY?

16:51.844 --> 16:55.678
<i>THOSE BOOKS WERE
BANNED MANY YEARS AGO.</i>

16:55.723 --> 16:57.339
WHERE DID
YOU FIND THEM?

16:57.433 --> 16:59.640
MY FATHER GAVE THEM TO ME
AND LOTS OF OTHERS.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.890
ARISTOTLE,
SOCRATES, DOSTOYEVSKY.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.597
DID YOU KNOVV THAT DOSTOYEVSKY
VVAS AN EPILEPTIC?

17:05.691 --> 17:07.602
HE WAS UGLY,
HE WAS DEFORMED,

17:07.693 --> 17:10.902
BUT HE VVROTE ABOUT BEAUTY,
ABOUT REAL BEAUTY.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.400
I MUST WARN YOU,
THIS SUBVERSIVE...

17:13.491 --> 17:15.323
THESE MEN
WROTE ABOUT LIFE

17:15.409 --> 17:18.742
AND ABOUT THE DIGNITY OF
THE INDMDUAL HUMAN SPIRIT

17:18.829 --> 17:19.954
AND ABOUT LOVE.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.074
THIS IS ENOUGH!

17:23.334 --> 17:26.122
THE INTRODUCTION OF SMUT
INTO THIS INTERVIEW

17:26.212 --> 17:28.954
WILL NOT HELP YOUR CASE,
YOUNG LADY, NOT AT ALL.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.789
MAY I GO?

17:30.883 --> 17:34.251
<i>YES, OERTPJNLY, \ HAVE
ARRANGED A ROOM FOR YOU.</i>

17:34.345 --> 17:35.961
YOU WILL BE
QUITE COMFORTABLE.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.092
I DON'T VVANNA STAY HERE.
I VVANNA GO HOME!

17:38.182 --> 17:40.674
IT'LL BE TEMPORARY. YOUR
MOTHER VVILL BE INFORMED

17:40.768 --> 17:43.135
AND YOU WILL BE
ALLOWED VISITORS.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.812
COME, MY DEAR.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.639
WHY DO I HAVE
TO STAY HERE?

17:47.733 --> 17:49.474
I AM AFRAID THAT
FOR THE TIME BEING

17:49.569 --> 17:51.776
YOU MUST LET US DECIDE
WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.444
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO HURT YOU,

17:53.531 --> 17:55.272
WE'RE ONLY
GOING TO HELP YOU.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.414
THIS WAY, LANA.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.664
SHE'S RIGHT
IN HERE.

18:13.342 --> 18:14.844
MARILYN?

18:14.927 --> 18:19.797
MARILYN, YOU
HAVE VISITORS.

18:19.890 --> 18:20.880
MOTHER?

18:25.146 --> 18:26.762
SHE VVAS QUITE UPSET LAST NIGHT.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.930
I GAVE HER SOMETHING
TO HELP HER SLEEP.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.436
SHE'S ALL RIGHT,
ISN'T SHE?

18:30.484 --> 18:31.986
YOU HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING?

18:32.069 --> 18:34.527
JUST A
MILD SEDATIVE.

18:34.614 --> 18:38.107
NOW IF YOU LADIES
WILL EXCUSE ME.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.033
DARLING, WE'D HAVE
BEEN HERE SOONER

18:41.120 --> 18:43.612
BUT THE DOCTOR SAID
YOU WERE SLEEPING.

18:43.706 --> 18:45.037
DO YOU FEEL
ALL RIGHT?

18:45.124 --> 18:47.035
YES.
HELLO, VALERIE.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.663
HI, HONEY,
WHAT HAPPENED?

18:49.754 --> 18:51.665
NOTHING.

18:51.756 --> 18:54.498
THEY JUST WOULDN'T
LET ME GO.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.879
OH, MOTHER, THEY'RE
GONNA DO IT ANYWAY.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.505
THEY'RE GONNA
MAKE ME DO IT!

18:58.596 --> 19:01.213
NO, MARILYN, DR. REX
PROMISED, REMEMBER?

19:01.307 --> 19:02.547
HE WAS LYING!

19:02.642 --> 19:04.633
LYING, BUT
WHY SHOULD HE?

19:04.727 --> 19:09.392
HE HAS TO SAY THAT TO KEEP
PEOPLE FROM FINDING OUT

19:09.482 --> 19:11.894
THE TRANSFORMATION IS GONNA BE
DONE VVHETHER YOU VVANT IT OR NOT.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.066
I DON'T SEE
WHY YOU'RE UNHAPPY

19:14.153 --> 19:16.064
VVHEN ALL THEY VVANT TO
DO IS MAKE YOU PRETTY.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.988
BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE!

19:19.075 --> 19:21.362
LAST NIGHT, BEFORE
I WENT TO SLEEP,

19:21.452 --> 19:23.989
I REMEMBERED SOMETHING
THAT FATHER SAID.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.323
HE SAID, "WHEN
EVERYONE IS BEAUTIFUL

19:27.416 --> 19:28.668
"NO ONE WILL BE

19:28.751 --> 19:31.368
"BECAUSE WITHOUT UGLINESS

19:31.462 --> 19:33.829
THERE CAN BE
NO BEAUTY."

19:33.881 --> 19:35.588
MOTHER, DON'T
YOU UNDERSTAND?

19:35.675 --> 19:37.666
THEY DON'T CARE WHETHER
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL OR NOT.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.001
THEY JUST VVANT EVERYONE
TO BE THE SAME.

19:40.054 --> 19:44.093
"THEY"? WHO ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.924
UH, I'M TERRIBLY SORRY,

19:46.018 --> 19:49.181
BUT I'M AFRAID IT'S
TIME TO LEA\/E NOVV.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.012
OH, WELL.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.351
IF IT'S
ALL RIGHT,

19:52.441 --> 19:53.647
I'D LIKE TO TALK
TO MARILYN.

19:53.734 --> 19:54.849
JUST FOR A
FEW MINUTES.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.400
DON'T WORRY, DARLING

19:56.487 --> 19:58.194
EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.949
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.373
I MEAN ABOUT WHAT
YOUR FATHER SAID

20:10.459 --> 20:11.961
AND... WELL,
I DON'T SEE WHY

20:12.044 --> 20:13.910
YOU'RE SO CONCERNED
ABOUT HIM.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.462
HE'S DEAD.

20:16.549 --> 20:20.167
I MEAN, SURELY YOU'VE
HAD OTHER FATHERS.

20:20.261 --> 20:21.968
MY MOTHER'S BEEN
MARRIED 11 TIMES

20:22.054 --> 20:23.465
AND PERSONALLY

20:23.556 --> 20:25.547
I'VE LIKED THE
STEPFATHERS BETTER.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.598
VALERIE, PLEASE DON'T.

20:27.685 --> 20:30.393
I KNOVV YOU'VE HAD 9 FATHERS
SINCE THE FIRST ONE.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.937
EVERYBODY MARRIES
EVERYBODY THESE DAYS.

20:33.023 --> 20:34.730
VALERIE, STOP.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.558
I DON'T SEE HOVV ANYBODY
CAN STAY MARRIED

20:36.610 --> 20:39.443
TO THE SAME HUSBAND
FOR A HUNDRED YEARS.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.488
BESIDES, I'\/E HEARD THAT
YOUR FATHER VVAS PRETTY DULL.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.236
VALERIE, STOP IT!

20:44.285 --> 20:46.447
STOP TALKING
ABOUT MY FATHER!

20:46.537 --> 20:48.153
CAN'T ANY
OF YOU UNDERSTAND?

20:48.247 --> 20:49.658
I LOVED HIM!

20:49.749 --> 20:51.535
I CARED ABOUT HIM.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.582
HE VVAS GOOD AND HE VVAS
KIND AND HE CARED ABOUT ME;

20:53.627 --> 20:55.789
NOT WHAT I WORE,
NOT THE WAY I LOOKED

20:55.880 --> 20:58.372
BUT WHAT I THOUGHT,
WHAT I FELT.

20:58.466 --> 21:02.505
VVHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT, HE CARED ABOUT
HIMSELF AND HIS DIGNITY AS A HUMAN BEING.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.053
VALERIE, HE DIDN'T DIE
IN THE GANYMEDE INCIDENT.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.050
MY FATHER KILLED HIMSELF.

21:07.141 --> 21:08.757
<i>BECAUSE WHEN THEY TOOK
AWAY HIS IDENTITY,</i>

21:08.851 --> 21:11.263
HE HAD NO REASON
TO GO ON LIVING.

21:11.312 --> 21:13.974
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
YOU, MARILYN.

21:14.064 --> 21:16.806
VALERIE...

21:16.901 --> 21:19.017
CAN'T YOU
<i>FEEL</i> ANYTHING?

21:19.111 --> 21:22.445
WELL, OF
COURSE, SILLY.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.319
I FEEL... I FEEL GOOD.

21:25.409 --> 21:27.525
I ALWAYS FEEL GOOD.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.827
"LIFE IS PRETTY,
LIFE IS FUN

21:29.914 --> 21:32.030
IAM ALL
AND ALL IS ONE."

21:32.124 --> 21:34.206
[laughs weakly]

21:34.293 --> 21:36.375
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND,
CAN YOU?

21:36.462 --> 21:38.203
WHAT?

21:38.297 --> 21:42.837
OH. THEY CAN'T
UNDERSTAND.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.088
[sobbing]

21:44.178 --> 21:47.011
THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND!

21:47.097 --> 21:49.475
THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND.
