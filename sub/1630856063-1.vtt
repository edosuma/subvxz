-[Kayla] Wren, where are you?

00:30.000 --> 00:31.417
Are you here yet?

00:31.500 --> 00:33.292
Yeah, I'm, uh,
I'm a couple hours away.

00:33.375 --> 00:35.250
You know it's a long drive.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.333
-How are you holding up?
-[Kayla] I'm at Rachel's.

00:37.458 --> 00:39.458
I couldn't listen to them
fight anymore.

00:39.542 --> 00:42.167
Okay, um,
just crash there tonight

00:42.250 --> 00:44.000
and I'll come get you
in the morning. Okay?

00:44.083 --> 00:46.250
[Kayla] Okay. Do you remember
where she lives?

00:46.333 --> 00:49.125
I've only been gone a year.

00:49.208 --> 00:51.125
[Kayla] Yeah.
Just hurry up, okay?

00:51.208 --> 00:53.167
We all need you here.
Especially mom.

00:53.250 --> 00:55.833

Oh, this is my house.

Ah. You must be the daughter
who never visits.

02:33.917 --> 02:36.042
And who are you?

02:36.208 --> 02:39.250
I'm Mia. I'm a friend
of your mother's.

02:39.250 --> 02:42.083
Oh, she never mentioned you.

02:42.208 --> 02:45.375

Mom!

Mom?

No!

No!

04:08.042 --> 04:09.500
She's gone, dad.

04:09.542 --> 04:11.333
[Paul] I'll be right there.

04:18.375 --> 04:20.417
You must be Wren.

04:20.417 --> 04:23.500
-[Ridley] Sorry about your loss.
-I am.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.750
Sorry, who called the police?

04:25.875 --> 04:27.292
Hmm, standard protocol.

04:29.042 --> 04:30.583
Was she in the tub
when you arrived?

04:33.458 --> 04:35.125
A home can be
a deadly place.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.000
-Excuse me?
-The house.

04:37.042 --> 04:39.542
Did you know that
statistically,

04:39.625 --> 04:42.333
53.4 percent of people die
in their own home?

04:43.542 --> 04:45.333
What time did you find her?

04:45.375 --> 04:48.125
Um, like, I got home
about an hour ago.

04:48.208 --> 04:50.333
Hmm.

04:50.375 --> 04:53.292
Been a while since
you've been in town, no?

04:53.375 --> 04:55.292
I don't see why that's relevant.

04:55.292 --> 04:56.708
Odd timing.

04:57.917 --> 04:59.333
What's that?

05:00.375 --> 05:02.000
Odd timing.

05:02.083 --> 05:03.667
I mean, you come back
to the town

05:03.750 --> 05:05.417
after being away
for a long while.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.333
And your adopted mother dies.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.875
What a terrible coincidence.

05:12.375 --> 05:14.333
What are you trying
to say to me?

05:14.375 --> 05:16.875
-[door opens]
-My mom just died...

05:16.958 --> 05:18.500
Wren!

05:18.583 --> 05:20.167
Oh!

05:20.167 --> 05:22.667
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

05:22.708 --> 05:26.500
Oliver and I, we were out with a

for your loss, Paul.

05:38.792 --> 05:40.833
Hmm... I-I don't...

05:43.083 --> 05:46.917

I'll do without her...

[indistinct radio chatter]

05:58.333 --> 06:02.042
I'm so glad you're here.
But why are you here?

06:02.125 --> 06:04.042
-Kayla asked me to--
-Kayla!

06:04.208 --> 06:07.708
Oh, Kayla. Where is she?

06:07.708 --> 06:11.333
She's at Rachel's. I told her
I'd pick her up in the morning.

06:11.417 --> 06:13.500
Thank goodness.

06:13.583 --> 06:17.667
Let's give her one more good
night's sleep before we--

06:17.667 --> 06:20.125
If only,
if I had just been here,

06:20.208 --> 06:22.167
I-I could've done something.

06:22.333 --> 06:23.750
It's not your fault.

06:26.083 --> 06:28.125
What's going on?
Why are there cops outside?

06:30.250 --> 06:34.042
-Wren?
-Mom, huh...

06:34.125 --> 06:35.708
Had an accident...

06:37.375 --> 06:38.875
She's gone, Brody.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.500
What?

06:41.542 --> 06:42.792
What are you talking about?

06:42.792 --> 06:44.792
[crying]

06:44.792 --> 06:46.042
What happened?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.667
Dad? What happened?

06:48.708 --> 06:52.500
You heard her! She's dead, son.
She's dead.

08:27.375 --> 08:29.417
Nope.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.917
I'm gonna go get Kayla.

08:32.042 --> 08:33.208
I'll get her.

08:33.208 --> 08:35.625
I told her I was picking her up.

08:35.625 --> 08:37.333
As her real brother, I think--

08:37.417 --> 08:39.250
You know we don't say that.

08:39.333 --> 08:42.625
As her biological brother,
I should be the one to tell her.

08:42.708 --> 08:44.083
She's still my sister.

08:44.167 --> 08:48.125
I've been taking care of her...
since you left.

08:48.208 --> 08:49.708
I know.

08:59.417 --> 09:01.000
You've been amazing.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.167
So, let me get this.

09:55.542 --> 09:57.208
Look at you!

09:59.292 --> 10:00.875
Hmm, got so strong.

10:01.042 --> 10:03.542
Yup, I can even
pin down Brody now!

10:05.208 --> 10:06.875
I'm proud of you.

10:06.875 --> 10:09.875
Not that accountants are known
for their strength.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.917
So, what are we doing today?

10:12.917 --> 10:15.083
I was thinking we could
go to the park.

10:15.208 --> 10:18.250
Kayla, there's, um, something
I have to tell you.

10:21.417 --> 10:22.917
What?

10:33.375 --> 10:35.000
[door opens]

10:36.083 --> 10:38.750
-Oliver?
-Hi.

10:38.750 --> 10:42.167
[chuckles] I know
it's been a while...

10:42.208 --> 10:43.583
but I had to come see you.

10:46.708 --> 10:49.292
I'm sorry about your mom.

10:50.958 --> 10:52.500
You know how much I loved her.

10:52.583 --> 10:53.792
Thank you so much.

10:55.708 --> 10:57.417
I could come back later
if this is a bad time.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.167
It's fine. Really.

11:00.458 --> 11:02.000
Mind if I come in?

11:04.708 --> 11:06.875
I thought I heard your voice.

11:07.042 --> 11:08.292
Paul...

11:10.917 --> 11:13.125
I'm so sorry for your loss.

11:13.208 --> 11:15.042
-Thank you for coming.
-Of course.

11:15.125 --> 11:17.000
You know how much this
family means to me.

11:17.083 --> 11:19.625
I-I'm just gonna go
put these in some water.

11:19.708 --> 11:23.083
Ah! I'll do it.

11:23.208 --> 11:25.292
You two have a lot
of catching up to do.

11:32.917 --> 11:34.583
So...

11:34.667 --> 11:37.375
how's your little
art therapy thing going?

11:37.375 --> 11:39.042
It's really good, actually.

11:40.542 --> 11:42.667
And what about you?

11:42.750 --> 11:44.583
You still working for my dad?

11:44.667 --> 11:48.042
Of course. Yeah,
I'm-I'm his right hand man.

11:49.958 --> 11:52.333
I'm glad things didn't get
weird for you

11:52.417 --> 11:54.083
still working for my family.

11:55.875 --> 11:58.042
Did you, uh, want a coffee?

11:58.125 --> 11:59.833
Or, uh...

11:59.875 --> 12:02.000
You won't find any here.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.583
Julie switched her and your dad

12:03.708 --> 12:05.042
over to green tea
a couple months ago.

12:05.042 --> 12:06.333
Oh.

12:08.792 --> 12:10.750
Do you want to go grab one?

12:10.833 --> 12:12.292
They need me here.

12:12.458 --> 12:14.500
-Hmm.
-Oliver!

12:14.542 --> 12:16.500
Hey, kiddo.

12:16.542 --> 12:20.417
-You up for a coffee run?
-Yes, please. Can we go, Wren?

12:20.500 --> 12:23.708
[Kayla] It would be nice
to get out of here for a bit.

12:23.792 --> 12:25.708
I guess that decides it.

12:28.417 --> 12:30.375
[indistinct chatter]

12:35.000 --> 12:36.500
[Gina] You guys go ahead,
I'll catch up.

12:37.542 --> 12:38.958
Wren?

12:40.375 --> 12:41.875
Gina!

12:41.958 --> 12:44.208
I haven't seen you in so long!

12:47.750 --> 12:49.667
Not since your wedding day.

12:49.750 --> 12:52.708
Oh, shoots!
Sorry, I didn't...

12:52.708 --> 12:55.792
-No, it's okay.
-Are you two back together?

12:55.875 --> 12:57.792
No! No, we're...

12:57.917 --> 13:00.292
He was just so close
to my family, so...

13:01.958 --> 13:04.125
Right.
I'm so sorry.

13:05.792 --> 13:07.625
I heard about Julie.

13:07.625 --> 13:10.083
News travels fast around here.

13:10.167 --> 13:13.958
Um, I've been actually
working with her

13:13.958 --> 13:15.375
for the last few months.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.125
I didn't know that.

13:17.208 --> 13:19.458
Just helping with some admin
stuff at the store.

13:19.583 --> 13:22.208
You've always been good at
helping people get organized.

13:22.208 --> 13:23.667
[laughs]

13:23.792 --> 13:25.375
I actually have
something to give you.

13:25.458 --> 13:28.292
If maybe you can stop by
the store sometime this week?

13:28.375 --> 13:29.917
Of course.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.542
Okay. Great. It'll give us
a chance to catch up.

13:33.542 --> 13:35.042
I'd like that.

13:39.542 --> 13:41.375
-See you soon.
-See ya.

13:42.708 --> 13:45.292
[mellow music]

13:49.083 --> 13:52.250
-Goodnight, Oliver.
-Night, Kay.

13:52.333 --> 13:56.208
Hey, uh, thank you so much for
getting us out of here today.

13:56.292 --> 13:57.750
We both needed it.

13:57.875 --> 14:00.250
You always prefer a
distraction when you're upset.

14:00.333 --> 14:01.417
I haven't forgotten.

14:03.250 --> 14:04.333
Oliver...

14:06.375 --> 14:08.375
about everything that
happened last year.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.125
Hey. No need to do this now.

14:11.667 --> 14:12.917
You've got enough on your plate

14:13.000 --> 14:14.708
without having to worry
about that too.

14:14.792 --> 14:16.208
Thank you.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.542
Everything's forgiven, okay?

14:25.875 --> 14:27.500
Thank you, Oliver.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.917
[mellow music]

14:33.875 --> 14:35.958
I, I needed that.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.500
Me, too. [chuckles]

14:39.833 --> 14:41.458
Talk soon.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.250
Thank you.

15:09.083 --> 15:11.375
I'm so glad you're here.

15:11.458 --> 15:15.333
Things have been...
hard recently.

15:16.458 --> 15:17.625
Fighting?

15:23.792 --> 15:25.333
I don't remember them fighting.

15:27.833 --> 15:30.375
Yeah, well, they do now.

15:33.375 --> 15:35.250
Or they did.

15:36.917 --> 15:39.542
[indistinct TV chatter]

15:45.208 --> 15:46.625

-[thud]
-Oh, shoot.

16:52.792 --> 16:54.000
What are you doing?

16:54.125 --> 16:56.375
I was just going
to the bathroom.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.250
How long have
you been standing there?

16:59.833 --> 17:01.875
How long?

17:01.875 --> 17:03.542
What did you hear?

17:03.542 --> 17:05.750
Nothing.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.375
[Brody]
Time to go to bed, dad.

17:10.958 --> 17:16.250
I don't need you of all people
tell-telling me what to do.

17:18.958 --> 17:21.250
Come on.
I'll take you upstairs.

17:26.875 --> 17:28.500
Goodnight, Wren.

17:44.208 --> 17:46.167
I'm done for the night.

17:48.875 --> 17:51.625
I've never seen him...
like that.

17:53.958 --> 17:56.292
He's been drinking more lately.

17:57.292 --> 17:58.667
How long's that been going on?

18:00.542 --> 18:02.125
Since you left.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.458
[sighs] He'll-he'll be fine
in the morning.

18:08.458 --> 18:12.667
Thank you.... for everything.

18:24.458 --> 18:25.583
[door closes]

18:37.792 --> 18:39.833
[telephone rings]

18:43.833 --> 18:45.750
[sighs]

18:45.833 --> 18:47.333
Hey.

18:47.375 --> 18:49.792
Were you at dinner with him?

18:49.875 --> 18:53.208
Ah... with, with who?

18:53.375 --> 18:56.292
My Dad. Last night.

18:56.292 --> 18:59.208
[chuckles]
Oh, yeah. Why do you ask?

19:00.917 --> 19:03.500
He's just been acting...
strange.

19:04.792 --> 19:06.833
Well... [laughs]

19:06.833 --> 19:12.083
Isn't this your field? Isn't
that what trauma does to people?

19:12.167 --> 19:13.625
You're right.

19:16.250 --> 19:17.792
Goodnight, Oliver.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.667
Sweet dreams.

19:23.667 --> 19:26.250
[mellow music]

19:34.417 --> 19:35.917
Morning.

19:38.042 --> 19:40.167
Smells good.

19:40.167 --> 19:42.417
Gluten-free protein pancakes.

19:42.542 --> 19:44.833
What? No more sugary cereal?

19:44.875 --> 19:46.958
She's been performing
better since we started her

19:47.042 --> 19:49.083
on a high protein diet.

19:49.167 --> 19:51.542
Well done.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.917
How did you sleep?

19:53.917 --> 19:57.625
Bad. I kept having nightmares.

19:57.708 --> 19:59.542
It would be unusual
if you didn't, Kay.

20:01.625 --> 20:04.708
And it's okay for your psyche
to vent short term in that way.

20:04.792 --> 20:07.833
It's just your brain
trying to find order.

20:07.875 --> 20:10.458
I actually have an exercise that
might really help with that.

20:10.458 --> 20:12.458
She's been through enough
with out having to relive it.

20:12.458 --> 20:15.667
Well, that's not what it's
about. It'll be good for her.

20:15.875 --> 20:18.750
You don't know what's good
for her. Not anymore.

20:18.875 --> 20:21.000
Hello! I'm sitting right here.

20:21.083 --> 20:22.792
Kayla, why don't you
go upstairs?

20:22.875 --> 20:24.125
I'm not a kid anymore.

20:24.250 --> 20:25.958
I can handle whatever
you're gonna say.

20:26.042 --> 20:26.917
Fine.

20:28.542 --> 20:31.250
She's can't handle it.
Not right now.

20:31.375 --> 20:33.500
Believe me,
I know what's best for her.

20:33.583 --> 20:35.167
-So do I.
-Not anymore.

20:35.375 --> 20:37.333
I know what's best for me.

20:37.458 --> 20:38.917
-Kayla--
-I do, Brody.

20:41.417 --> 20:45.208
Well, I guess I'm just
the pancake chef then.

20:48.625 --> 20:50.542
Thank you, chef.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.333
I'm actually gonna
head out for a bit,

20:56.333 --> 20:58.333
let's do that exercise
little later.

21:00.042 --> 21:02.458
[dramatic music]

21:11.958 --> 21:13.500
No!

21:27.125 --> 21:28.500
[knock on door]

21:35.375 --> 21:37.000
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:37.042 --> 21:39.167
I, uh, wanted to return this

21:39.250 --> 21:40.542
and-and bring you
a thank you coffee.

21:40.625 --> 21:42.875
But, uh, the cardigan drank it.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.708
[scoffs]

21:44.833 --> 21:46.208
I'm so sorry, Oliver.

21:46.208 --> 21:47.917
I-I-I could have cleaned up

21:48.042 --> 21:49.917
if I knew you were coming.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.542
Let me fix this. I know how
much you love this sweater.

21:53.958 --> 21:55.792
[water running]

21:57.958 --> 22:01.833
I see you haven't done
much redecorating.

22:01.875 --> 22:03.500
You-you got great taste.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.375
Is the stain remover still
on the ensuite sink?

22:05.500 --> 22:07.375
Um, hey, hey, hey...

22:07.375 --> 22:11.208
Let's, uh, let's not worry
about it. Okay?

22:11.208 --> 22:13.917
-I'll wash it later.
-It'll stain.

22:13.917 --> 22:15.750
How about...

22:15.750 --> 22:19.042
How about I make you
a coffee. Huh?

22:19.125 --> 22:20.458
I won't even spill it.

22:20.583 --> 22:23.083
[suspenseful music]

22:29.042 --> 22:31.000
[laughs]

22:31.042 --> 22:33.042
It's been fun.

22:33.125 --> 22:34.500
Yeah.

22:34.583 --> 22:36.375
Hey. We should grab a bite.

22:36.375 --> 22:37.917
While you're in town.

22:41.875 --> 22:45.500
We could talk. Figure out
where things went wrong.

22:45.583 --> 22:48.542
I should... get back to Kayla.

22:48.625 --> 22:50.542
Thank you for the coffee.

22:50.625 --> 22:51.708
Wren.

22:57.250 --> 23:00.542
Thank you for...
still being there for me,

23:00.542 --> 23:03.042
even though I wasn't there
for you.

23:03.042 --> 23:05.958
[music continues]

23:32.958 --> 23:35.917
[music continues]

23:38.292 --> 23:40.375
So art therapy
doesn't just let you

23:40.375 --> 23:42.292
express yourself
and your feelings.

23:42.375 --> 23:44.333
It helps you uncover parts
of yourself

23:44.458 --> 23:47.458
that even you
didn't know existed.

23:47.542 --> 23:50.708
Like whatever's hiding
in my nightmares.

23:50.833 --> 23:52.833
We're going to start with
something more positive today.

23:52.958 --> 23:54.500
So you're going
to draw the place

23:54.500 --> 23:56.625
where you feel
the safest in the world.

24:06.375 --> 24:09.542
I'm coming up blank.
Where's yours?

24:21.458 --> 24:23.500
[Wren] Her bedroom
stayed with me.

24:29.333 --> 24:31.625
Your safe space is so close by.

24:31.708 --> 24:33.208
Yeah.

24:33.375 --> 24:35.083
I haven't been inside
since I was a kid.

24:36.458 --> 24:37.958
Since she died.

24:37.958 --> 24:41.542
Is it weird with it
being right there?

24:43.250 --> 24:46.583
It's probably part of why
I ran away from here.

24:48.625 --> 24:50.958
What did she die of?

24:51.083 --> 24:53.875
Mom and dad said
there was an accident at home.

24:54.042 --> 24:55.875
What kind of accident?

24:56.042 --> 24:57.917
I don't know.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.792
[Kayla] Really?

24:59.958 --> 25:03.500
Yeah, I-I didn't know
how to ask.

25:03.583 --> 25:05.542
And I didn't wanna give
the impression that I wasn't

25:05.625 --> 25:08.375
happy with the life
they gave me by adopting me.

25:08.542 --> 25:10.333
That's the same reason
Brody never asks

25:10.417 --> 25:12.083
them about our birth parents.

25:13.792 --> 25:17.667
What about you?
You talked to them about it?

25:17.750 --> 25:20.958
Of course I do.
It would kill me not to know!

25:25.667 --> 25:28.125
So, what are you going to draw?

25:31.542 --> 25:33.000
I'm gonna draw you.

25:34.417 --> 25:35.750
You're my safe space.

25:35.750 --> 25:38.167
[instrumental music]

26:00.625 --> 26:02.792
-Hey, you.
-Hi.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.042
Did you stop by
mom's shop today?

26:12.042 --> 26:13.958
No.

26:13.958 --> 26:15.792
[Paul] Why?

26:15.875 --> 26:17.458
You weren't at the store.

26:17.542 --> 26:19.542
Um...

26:19.542 --> 26:20.875
[scoffs]

26:20.875 --> 26:22.708
I was at the office all day.

26:22.792 --> 26:25.208
Then I-I went to the
funeral home.

26:29.167 --> 26:32.833
I'm glad to see that you're
spending time with Oliver again.

26:35.083 --> 26:38.667
I'd like to go to the funeral
home to see mom tomorrow.

26:38.750 --> 26:40.292
I wanna say goodbye.

26:42.042 --> 26:44.292
Oh, Wren, uh...

26:44.375 --> 26:45.708
I'm-I'm-I'm so sorry.

26:45.792 --> 26:49.208
We, we had her cremated
this afternoon.

26:49.375 --> 26:50.792
What?

26:50.792 --> 26:52.333
[Paul] The medical examiner
declared

26:52.458 --> 26:55.542
her death accidental
th-this morning.

26:55.625 --> 26:57.292
I needed to put her to rest.

26:57.375 --> 26:59.250
Without even telling me?

26:59.250 --> 27:00.792
This is what she wanted.

27:02.250 --> 27:03.792
She was my mother!

27:06.208 --> 27:07.333
Wren...

27:08.750 --> 27:10.833
Look, I'm-I'm sorry.

27:14.042 --> 27:15.958
[grunting]

27:21.333 --> 27:24.250
[breathing heavily]

27:36.125 --> 27:38.625
[intense music]

27:50.625 --> 27:53.375
[pencil scratching]

28:06.375 --> 28:08.875
[music continues]

28:13.750 --> 28:16.750
[pencil scratching]

28:36.542 --> 28:38.167
[music continues]

28:55.708 --> 28:58.792
[suspenseful music]

29:02.625 --> 29:03.917
Dad?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.333
Dad?

29:26.208 --> 29:28.375
[music continues]

29:39.542 --> 29:41.958
[intense music]

29:56.042 --> 29:58.167
I think Wren is
going to be a problem.

30:07.167 --> 30:08.875
[bell chimes]

30:19.875 --> 30:21.292
[door closes]

30:22.875 --> 30:25.333
[instrumental music]

30:28.667 --> 30:30.333
Oh! Hey, Wren!

30:30.417 --> 30:32.750
Hey! Did I just see
my next door neighbor?

30:32.833 --> 30:36.583
Mia? Yeah, she just left.
She needed some files.

30:36.708 --> 30:40.000
-Files?
-She's co-owner.

30:40.125 --> 30:42.250
Ju-Julie brought her on
about six months ago.

30:42.333 --> 30:44.500
No one told me that.

30:44.625 --> 30:46.542
-Tea?
-Sure.

30:48.167 --> 30:50.625
Yeah, Julie brought me
in to help out

30:50.708 --> 30:52.333
and bring some order
to the chaos.

30:52.458 --> 30:54.042
Chaos?

30:54.042 --> 30:57.125
I don't think Mia is the
best business person.

30:57.208 --> 30:59.917
Then why'd my mom bring her in?

31:00.000 --> 31:01.750
She must've had her reasons.

31:01.875 --> 31:04.667
Oh, before I forget,
first order of business...

31:04.792 --> 31:06.375
These are for you.

31:08.083 --> 31:09.500
Julie said should anything
ever happen,

31:09.583 --> 31:11.208
to give the keys only you.

31:11.333 --> 31:13.167
She owns the building,
you know.

31:13.250 --> 31:15.083
She wanted you
to have this place.

31:19.875 --> 31:22.833
Doesn't Mia have keys?

31:22.958 --> 31:25.500
Your mom asked her to hand hers'
over a few weeks ago.

31:25.625 --> 31:27.208
Really?

31:27.208 --> 31:30.333
I actually wanted to mention
something to you.

31:30.417 --> 31:34.583
A few days before the accident,
Julie said something strange.

31:34.708 --> 31:38.000
She told me she found out
Mia had stole from her.

31:40.042 --> 31:42.875
But she didn't mentioned what.

31:42.958 --> 31:44.875
So anything missing
from the shop?

31:44.958 --> 31:47.667
Not that I could find.

31:47.708 --> 31:48.833
Do you have
a bookkeeping records?

31:48.833 --> 31:50.750
Of course.
It's in the office.

31:50.833 --> 31:53.000
I'll have Brody look these over.

31:53.125 --> 31:55.542
Oh, second order of business.

31:55.542 --> 31:56.875
Are you gonna tell me
what happened with Oliver

31:56.875 --> 31:58.958
that day or not?

32:00.792 --> 32:02.375
I'll tell you,

32:02.458 --> 32:04.625
but I'm gonna need something
stronger than tea.

32:04.625 --> 32:07.000
Hmm, I have just the thing.

32:08.375 --> 32:10.042
[Gina] The whole town
was so shocked

32:10.167 --> 32:12.333
when you left Oliver
at the altar.

32:12.417 --> 32:14.750
My family included.

32:14.750 --> 32:16.042
So why'd you do it?

32:16.125 --> 32:20.000
Ever since Julie and Paul
adopted me, I...

32:20.042 --> 32:23.458
sort of felt like I was
living someone else's life.

32:23.542 --> 32:26.917
I was the daughter
they could never have,

32:26.917 --> 32:29.667
but I was already
someone else's daughter.

32:29.750 --> 32:31.292
Looks like a lot of pressure.

32:34.375 --> 32:35.917
Julie and Paul
are the ones who set me up

32:36.000 --> 32:37.667
with Oliver in the first place.

32:37.750 --> 32:39.917
[scoffs]
I didn't know that.

32:40.042 --> 32:43.375
Yeah. He was an up-and-coming
architect at the firm.

32:43.375 --> 32:46.167
They, they thought the
company would stay

32:46.250 --> 32:48.667
in the family
when we got married.

32:48.792 --> 32:52.000
The arrangement was perfect.
For them.

32:52.083 --> 32:54.208
So they pushed you into it?

32:54.292 --> 32:56.583
No, I wouldn't say that either.

32:58.125 --> 33:00.042
I really did love him.

33:04.042 --> 33:06.125
But something didn't
feel right between us.

33:07.708 --> 33:11.000
So you hanging out with Oliver
the other day...

33:12.875 --> 33:15.417
He still feels like
home somehow.

33:18.375 --> 33:21.833
Maybe there's a chance
you'll rekindle things?

33:21.875 --> 33:23.375
I have missed him.

33:27.167 --> 33:31.375
But if things were reversed
and he left me at the altar...

33:31.458 --> 33:34.333
I don't know if I'd be able
to forgive him.

33:34.333 --> 33:36.750
So...

33:36.750 --> 33:39.500
I can't imagine how
he feels about me right now.

33:45.708 --> 33:47.375
[dog barking in distance]

33:49.542 --> 33:52.042
[birds chirping]

33:56.000 --> 33:57.750
[knock on door]

33:59.417 --> 34:00.542
[door opens]

34:02.000 --> 34:03.250
Hi.

34:04.542 --> 34:06.500
Hello.

34:06.625 --> 34:09.000
I was just in the middle
of preparing canapes

34:09.042 --> 34:10.125
for Julie's wake tonight.

34:10.208 --> 34:12.333
Oh, that's very kind.

34:14.542 --> 34:18.042
Is there something
I can do for you, Wren?

34:18.042 --> 34:21.000
I'm, um, uh...

34:21.083 --> 34:24.000
I'm collecting memories
of mom from her friends

34:24.083 --> 34:26.167
that we can share
at the wake tonight.

34:26.250 --> 34:28.167
I was hoping you had a memory.

34:29.875 --> 34:32.417
What a nice idea.
Please, come in.

34:34.583 --> 34:36.708
[suspenseful music]

34:40.250 --> 34:42.958
It's very nice of you
to do all this.

34:42.958 --> 34:45.000
You two must have been close.

34:45.125 --> 34:46.833
We didn't know
each other very long,

34:47.000 --> 34:50.042
but we became instant friends.

34:50.042 --> 34:53.208
And you moved in here
about a year ago?

34:53.292 --> 34:57.167
Yes. I was so excited
when I came back on the market.

34:57.250 --> 35:00.042
I think we became
such fast friends

35:00.167 --> 35:03.167
because Julie was feeling
really lonely at the time.

35:03.167 --> 35:06.333
We met shortly after
your would-be wedding.

35:07.750 --> 35:09.667
Glad you could be there for her.

35:09.708 --> 35:14.333
Yes, well, someone had to be.
She was in a bad way.

35:16.750 --> 35:20.583
I understand she, uh, brought
you into the plant shop.

35:20.583 --> 35:22.833
Yes, she was looking for
a breath of fresh air

35:22.875 --> 35:26.875
and I have experience in
marketing so it was a great fit.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.333
Hmm. How was business going?

35:29.417 --> 35:32.625
Hmm, we had our
growing pains at first,

35:32.708 --> 35:37.375
but things were really starting
to pick up just before she...

35:37.375 --> 35:39.750
So you really enjoyed
working together then?

35:39.875 --> 35:41.458
Very much.

35:41.542 --> 35:45.083
Would you like me to share
a memory from that time?

35:45.083 --> 35:48.292
-For who?
-For the wake...

35:48.375 --> 35:50.500
For the the memories
you're gathering.

35:50.625 --> 35:52.542
Yes, please.

35:52.542 --> 35:54.458
Once we were working
late waiting

35:54.458 --> 35:55.833
on an order of rare
philodendrons--

35:55.917 --> 35:57.667
[telephone ringing]

36:03.042 --> 36:04.667
Would you please excuse me?

36:04.667 --> 36:06.250
Of course.

36:09.917 --> 36:11.708
[Mia] Hello.

36:11.792 --> 36:13.708
Are you kidding me?

36:13.833 --> 36:15.250
You're sure?

36:16.708 --> 36:17.792
This is ridiculous.

36:19.208 --> 36:21.333
She owned the building.

36:21.417 --> 36:23.333
I'm her business partner.

36:24.375 --> 36:27.208
[indistinct chatter]

36:28.333 --> 36:30.833
[intense music]

36:58.333 --> 37:00.833
[mellow music]

37:28.708 --> 37:30.750
[intense music]

37:32.375 --> 37:34.292
What are you doing up here?

37:46.792 --> 37:50.542
[gasps] Dad.

37:50.542 --> 37:53.250
What were you doing at Mia's?
Why are you running?

37:53.333 --> 37:56.208
I just realized
I forgot my phone.

37:56.333 --> 37:57.958
We were just going
through some things

37:57.958 --> 37:59.500
for mom's wake tonight.

38:01.833 --> 38:02.833
Oh!

38:04.250 --> 38:06.458
How did my birth mother die?

38:06.542 --> 38:09.583
Why-why are you asking about her
after all these years?

38:09.667 --> 38:13.375
I guess, being in my old house
brought up some memories.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.792
You were just a
little girl then.

38:15.792 --> 38:18.375
You-you don't even have
memories from that time.

38:18.375 --> 38:20.333
So tell me what happened.

38:20.375 --> 38:22.250
-She died in an accident.
-What kind of accident?

38:22.333 --> 38:24.542
It's your mother's wake tonight.

38:24.667 --> 38:27.375
It's not the right time to be
picking at old wounds.

38:38.458 --> 38:40.667
[water running]

38:47.417 --> 38:50.625
-You all right?
-Yeah.

38:50.708 --> 38:53.667
-Hey, would you do me a favor?
-Sure.

38:53.750 --> 38:56.333
Those are the files
from mom's business.

38:56.458 --> 38:58.167
Would you take
a look over them

38:58.208 --> 39:01.167
and tell me what exactly is
happening with the money?

39:01.292 --> 39:03.708
Is there anything
I should be looking out for?

39:03.708 --> 39:06.458
Gina told me that
mom accused Mia

39:06.542 --> 39:08.958
of stealing something from her
just before she died.

39:09.042 --> 39:11.167
You want to see
if there's any proof of that.

39:11.208 --> 39:12.875
I'll take a look and see...

39:12.875 --> 39:13.958
[Kayla screams]

39:15.125 --> 39:17.667
[intense music]

39:19.583 --> 39:21.792
-Are you okay?
-What happened?

39:21.875 --> 39:23.417
What is this?

39:23.500 --> 39:25.500
-It's...
-Why would you draw this?

39:25.625 --> 39:27.208
What did I say about making her
relive her trauma?

39:27.333 --> 39:29.458
-I was trying to work through--
-I knew this was a bad idea.

39:29.542 --> 39:30.833
I know what I'm doing, Brody!

39:30.917 --> 39:32.500
Mom is not just some
twisted art project.

39:32.583 --> 39:34.792
Just leave me alone.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.667
Kayla...

39:41.000 --> 39:43.250
[mellow music]

39:43.375 --> 39:46.208
-Let me try to explain.
-I said, leave me alone!

39:46.292 --> 39:49.875
You heard her.
She needs some space. From you.

39:54.292 --> 39:55.833
[grunts]

40:04.125 --> 40:06.625
[suspenseful music]

40:14.792 --> 40:16.375
Come in.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.542
[Wren] Thanks so much for
inviting me in, Mrs. Jenkins.

40:21.667 --> 40:23.750
[Florence]
Please, call me Florence.

40:26.542 --> 40:29.625
I wanted to ask you
about my next door neighbor Mia.

40:29.708 --> 40:32.000
Her and my mother were
good friends, right?

40:32.125 --> 40:35.667
That's what Mia wanted
people to think, yes.

40:35.792 --> 40:38.667
I saw the jealous look
on Mia's face

40:38.750 --> 40:40.625
when Julie's back was turned.

40:40.708 --> 40:43.000
You notice a lot
if you just watch.

40:44.958 --> 40:46.583
Mia said she was excited

40:46.708 --> 40:48.667
when that house came back
on the market.

40:48.750 --> 40:51.083
Do you know why she was
so eager to get it?

40:51.208 --> 40:53.750
[Florence] The house belonged
to your grandparents.

40:53.875 --> 40:56.125
When they died,
they left it to Sonya.

40:56.208 --> 41:00.583
Mia was finally able to scrape
her pennies together

41:00.583 --> 41:02.500
and bring it back
into the family.

41:02.500 --> 41:04.667
Bring it back into...

41:04.750 --> 41:07.375
Are you, are you saying
Mia and Sonya were related?

41:07.500 --> 41:10.167
Your birth mother
and Mia were cousins.

41:10.208 --> 41:12.958
Didn't you know that?

41:12.958 --> 41:14.583
So Mia is my...

41:16.042 --> 41:17.917
First cousin once removed.

41:20.708 --> 41:24.000
-Did Julie know that?
-She must've, yes.

41:24.083 --> 41:27.667
You knew my mother then.
Sonya, I mean.

41:27.750 --> 41:31.000
I did.
She was a wonderful woman.

41:31.125 --> 41:33.250
[instrumental music]

41:33.250 --> 41:34.667
Do you know how she died?

41:34.792 --> 41:37.250
I heard there was
some kind of an accident.

41:37.250 --> 41:43.000
It was very tragic. She fell
and drowned in the bathtub.

41:46.375 --> 41:49.000
[intense music]

41:49.083 --> 41:52.667
Oh, I've upset you.
I'm sorry for being so direct.

41:52.708 --> 41:55.500
No, no, please
don't worry about it.

41:55.583 --> 41:57.292
Thank you so much for your time.

41:57.375 --> 42:02.583
Oh, Julie came here too asking
about her just before she died.

42:02.667 --> 42:05.875
-About Mia?
-No, about Sonya.

42:07.333 --> 42:09.000
Thank you.

42:14.875 --> 42:16.500
[doorbell dings]

42:19.208 --> 42:21.500
This place looks amazing.

42:21.625 --> 42:23.333
My mom would have loved it.

42:23.417 --> 42:24.917
That's what I hoped!

42:27.667 --> 42:30.542
I wish I could stay,

42:30.667 --> 42:32.417
but it's my night to take care
of my gran, so...

42:32.500 --> 42:36.042
Of course. I understand.
Thanks again.

42:45.875 --> 42:47.042
Kayla...

42:51.583 --> 42:54.167
She's a moody teenager.

42:54.292 --> 42:55.500
She'll come around.

42:55.583 --> 42:56.917
I hope so.

42:59.083 --> 43:00.375
Thanks for coming.

43:00.375 --> 43:02.542
I'm here to help.

43:02.625 --> 43:06.958
I, uh, already set up
the bar over there.

43:07.042 --> 43:11.792
And I stashed something here
just for you, if you need it.

43:13.875 --> 43:16.167
Ah, look.

43:16.208 --> 43:17.833
I got the coffee stains out.

43:19.875 --> 43:22.500
-What?
-I found out how Sonya died.

43:22.625 --> 43:25.667
I thought she had an accident.

43:25.792 --> 43:30.167
She did. She... fell
and drowned in the bathtub.

43:30.292 --> 43:34.625
-Just like my mom.
-That's a crazy coincidence.

43:34.625 --> 43:36.250
Don't you think
it's a little suspicious?

43:37.750 --> 43:40.250
It just doesn't
sit right with me.

43:40.250 --> 43:42.583
There's something there.

43:42.667 --> 43:45.875
All I see is
two horrible tragedies.

43:45.958 --> 43:48.333
I've gotta ask my dad
what Mia's deal is.

43:48.458 --> 43:51.917
Maybe right now
isn't the right time?

43:52.000 --> 43:53.958
Mia and Sonya were cousins.

43:54.042 --> 43:55.333
Mia was always desperate
to own that house.

43:57.417 --> 43:58.833
She was friends
with Julie, and now

43:58.917 --> 44:01.000
she's trying to take over
the shop.

44:01.083 --> 44:02.542
I need to figure out
what Mia is cooking up--

44:02.542 --> 44:05.000
Canapes. I already told you.

44:05.125 --> 44:06.875
Oh. Hi.

44:06.958 --> 44:09.000
Um, have you seen my dad yet?

44:09.000 --> 44:11.792
He wasn't anywhere to be found
when I arrived.

44:11.875 --> 44:13.875
Here, set up back there.

44:14.875 --> 44:16.375
I'll go find Paul.

44:27.833 --> 44:29.375
[Oliver] There you are.

44:30.708 --> 44:32.375
I'm glad you're here.

44:32.458 --> 44:34.792
There's nowhere I'd rather be.

44:34.792 --> 44:38.917
The loyalty that you've shown
the business, and to me...

44:39.042 --> 44:41.167
I'm so grateful that
you're part of the team.

44:43.083 --> 44:45.875
So, you and Wren.

44:45.875 --> 44:47.542
You seem to be on your way
to reconciling.

44:47.542 --> 44:49.667
It certainly feels that way.

44:49.792 --> 44:52.167
[Paul] So this opens
the question again

44:52.292 --> 44:56.167
of who'll take over the firm
when I retire.

44:56.292 --> 45:00.750
If you do end up
getting married after all...

45:00.750 --> 45:02.833
the firm is yours.

45:02.917 --> 45:05.917
I'll do everything
I can to make that happen.

45:06.042 --> 45:09.375
I wanna keep the business
in the family.

45:09.458 --> 45:10.750
You're the only one I can trust.

45:12.208 --> 45:14.042
To becoming one of us.

45:15.792 --> 45:18.500
I, uh, I should let you know,

45:18.583 --> 45:19.750
Wren is starting
to ask questions.

45:19.750 --> 45:21.833
Does she know anything?

45:21.917 --> 45:25.083
Not yet, but she's determined
to ask you about Mia.

45:26.875 --> 45:29.667
I-I convinced her that
tonight is not a good time.

45:33.583 --> 45:35.167
If she keeps pushing...

45:38.042 --> 45:40.708
give her one of these.
She'll be easier to deal with.

45:48.208 --> 45:49.875
The bruschetta shouldn't be
hiding back here.

45:49.875 --> 45:51.958
Go put it by the door.

46:00.458 --> 46:01.708
Are you going to explain

46:01.792 --> 46:03.917
what you were doing
upstairs in my house?

46:04.042 --> 46:06.708
Oh, I was just looking
for the bathroom.

46:06.708 --> 46:08.458
I don't like people sticking
their noses

46:08.542 --> 46:10.083
where they don't belong.

46:10.167 --> 46:11.542
If you have nothing to hide,

46:11.542 --> 46:13.333
it shouldn't be a problem,
right?

46:13.375 --> 46:14.917
What are you implying?

46:15.000 --> 46:17.417
Nothing at all... yet.

46:18.583 --> 46:20.458
Back off.

46:20.542 --> 46:21.417
Or else what?

46:23.042 --> 46:25.500
Or else you'll regret it.

46:37.042 --> 46:38.708
[Wren] Have been thinking
about it

46:38.833 --> 46:43.000
and Kayla's right,
we can't keep fighting.

46:43.125 --> 46:44.417
Not today.

46:44.542 --> 46:46.750
I was going through those papers
you gave me.

46:46.875 --> 46:50.167
And? What'd you find?

46:50.208 --> 46:52.875
Looks like Mia was siphoning
money into her personal account.

46:52.958 --> 46:56.333
[gasps]
How much?

46:56.417 --> 46:58.958
Enough to sink the business
in a couple more months.

46:59.042 --> 47:01.833
She was bleeding them dry.

47:01.875 --> 47:04.750
Julie would have figured it out
eventually.

47:04.833 --> 47:06.167
If she hadn't already.

47:07.875 --> 47:08.917
She raised you
since you were nine

47:09.042 --> 47:11.000
but you never once called her...

47:20.833 --> 47:23.083
[intense music]

47:26.917 --> 47:29.250
Hey. Kayla. Wait!

47:29.333 --> 47:30.333
I'm sorry.

47:30.458 --> 47:32.417
Okay, Brody and I
were out of line.

47:33.875 --> 47:36.792
Okay, I was out of line.

47:36.875 --> 47:38.167
I just, I want to apologize

47:38.250 --> 47:42.583
for not focusing
on what's important today.

47:42.708 --> 47:46.542
Today's all about mom, and
I haven't been acting like it.

47:48.917 --> 47:51.542
Fine. I forgive you.

47:56.083 --> 47:57.667
Do you know how much time

47:57.708 --> 47:59.167
dad and Mia have
been spending together?

47:59.250 --> 48:01.375
-You're still doing it!
-Kayla--

48:01.375 --> 48:03.083
Mom and dad may have been
fighting a lot.

48:03.208 --> 48:05.083
-But they loved each other.
-I know that--

48:05.083 --> 48:07.000
People who love each other,
don't abandon each other.

48:07.125 --> 48:08.917
They don't leave people
at the altar

48:09.000 --> 48:11.458
or run away across the country.

48:11.542 --> 48:13.667
Look, I'm sorry I left--

48:13.750 --> 48:15.833
And whatever you think
about dad,

48:15.917 --> 48:18.042
he was there for us.
You weren't.

48:18.042 --> 48:19.542
I'm going home.

48:19.667 --> 48:20.667
I'll come with you.

48:20.750 --> 48:22.333
I don't need a babysitter.

48:27.833 --> 48:30.000
[glass clinking]

48:30.083 --> 48:34.625
Thank you to everyone
for being here tonight.

48:34.708 --> 48:37.500
Julie was an incredible person

48:37.542 --> 48:41.250
and she touched the lives
of everyone in this room.

48:41.333 --> 48:43.833
I thought it would be
a lovely idea

48:43.833 --> 48:47.000
for us to share our favorite
memory of Julie.

48:49.083 --> 48:52.167
Julie had a naturally
inquisitive spirit,

48:52.250 --> 48:55.167
a quality that
she passed on in spades

48:55.167 --> 48:58.792
to her adopted daughter Wren.

48:58.875 --> 49:01.375
One day, Julie was wondering

49:01.375 --> 49:04.125
where the moonlight
philodendrons

49:04.208 --> 49:07.042
that we had been ordering
actually come from.

49:10.208 --> 49:12.833
I think something is going on
with my dad and Mia.

49:12.833 --> 49:16.667
What? [scoffs]
That's ridiculous.

49:16.750 --> 49:18.333
I've gotta ask him about this.

49:18.417 --> 49:21.667
Right now doesn't seem
appropriate.

49:23.875 --> 49:28.208
Hey! You need to relax.

49:28.292 --> 49:31.042
Come with me.
I've got just the thing.

49:34.875 --> 49:37.417
I saw the two of them
holding hands earlier!

49:37.500 --> 49:41.083
She's supporting her
dead best friend's husband.

49:41.083 --> 49:43.042
It's more than that.

49:49.917 --> 49:52.458
[suspenseful music]

49:57.833 --> 49:59.375
Listen, um...

50:01.417 --> 50:05.375
I can't tell you
not to ask him...

50:07.667 --> 50:09.250
but it's your mom's wake.

50:12.542 --> 50:14.667
Have a drink.

50:14.792 --> 50:18.458
Try and relax... and you can
ask him about it tomorrow.

50:21.208 --> 50:22.625
Fine.

50:32.792 --> 50:36.625
Hm... it's actually really nice.

50:36.708 --> 50:38.875
Thanks.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.542
Yeah, I thought you could, uh,
use some wine.

50:46.542 --> 50:48.375
[Paul] Thank you so much,
everyone

50:48.458 --> 50:51.333
for sharing these
magnificent stories

50:51.333 --> 50:53.708
of our beloved Julie.

50:53.875 --> 50:56.500
She was the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

50:56.625 --> 50:59.208
-Okay, that's it.
-Oh, don't do this. Hey, hey.

50:59.208 --> 51:00.625
Come on, let's get you
freshened up.

51:00.708 --> 51:01.708
She's the best thing that's ever

51:01.708 --> 51:03.667
happened to you, huh?

51:03.792 --> 51:05.708
[laughing]

51:05.833 --> 51:07.250
You have a funny way
of showing it.

51:07.375 --> 51:08.542
Wren!

51:08.625 --> 51:10.875
Are you going to share
a memory of mom?

51:10.958 --> 51:14.042
Or have those
been cremated, too?

51:14.167 --> 51:16.958
It seems that
in my daughter's grief

51:17.042 --> 51:18.083
that she drank too much.

51:18.208 --> 51:20.292
Adopted daughter!

51:20.375 --> 51:23.500
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.

51:23.542 --> 51:25.958
I'm sure you can all appreciate
how difficult this is for us.

51:26.042 --> 51:30.000
What's going on
with you and Mia, dad?

51:30.125 --> 51:32.333
Don't be shy. Tell everyone.

51:32.375 --> 51:34.167
-That's enough!
-At your mother's wake...

51:34.250 --> 51:36.125
-How dare you imply--
-I wanna stay and reminisce!

51:36.208 --> 51:38.000
[Oliver] We need to go.
[Wren] Stop it, I wanna stay.

51:38.083 --> 51:40.708
She just needs to
sleep this off.

51:40.708 --> 51:42.250
Thank you, son.

51:48.625 --> 51:50.208
There you go.

51:55.042 --> 51:56.583
[Oliver] Let's get you to home,
okay?

51:56.667 --> 52:00.625
No, I, I don't wanna
go back there.

52:02.708 --> 52:03.750
[sighs]

52:04.792 --> 52:07.083
All right, come on.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.167
Okay, come on.

52:17.250 --> 52:19.375
Hey, hey, come on.

52:22.292 --> 52:24.750
You're okay, you're okay.
Ah, there you go.

52:28.833 --> 52:32.208
-Okay, hey.
-I feel so dizzy.

52:32.292 --> 52:34.292
You've just have the spins.

52:34.375 --> 52:36.500
There you go,
there you go.

52:38.833 --> 52:40.667
Okay, okay.

52:44.833 --> 52:47.625
[suspenseful music]

52:49.917 --> 52:51.542
Wren.

52:57.042 --> 52:58.792
Wren?

53:01.708 --> 53:03.250
Wren?

53:14.333 --> 53:16.500
You will be mine again.

53:19.833 --> 53:22.292
[intense music]

53:43.125 --> 53:44.708
[groans]

53:46.208 --> 53:48.708
[clattering]

54:02.250 --> 54:03.792
[groans]

54:20.333 --> 54:22.333
[Oliver] Morning, sleepy head.

54:23.375 --> 54:25.083
Your favorite hangover cure.

54:25.167 --> 54:26.667
Aw!

54:26.708 --> 54:28.583
And do I need it.

54:30.417 --> 54:32.333
What happened last night?

54:32.417 --> 54:35.958
Ah! You were pretty drunk...

54:36.042 --> 54:38.250
Oh, no. What did I...

54:39.333 --> 54:41.375
-Not good, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

54:41.542 --> 54:42.500
Oh...

54:42.625 --> 54:44.958
Maybe best if I don't know.

54:45.083 --> 54:46.625
[sighs]

54:48.917 --> 54:51.333
Thanks for taking care of me.

54:51.333 --> 54:52.875
Of course.

54:52.958 --> 54:54.167
I hope you got me out of there

54:54.250 --> 54:55.417
before I really
embarrassed myself.

54:55.500 --> 54:58.542
Ah, it was a close call.

54:58.667 --> 54:59.792
Oh.

54:59.875 --> 55:01.792
[laughing]

55:10.958 --> 55:15.042
I'm really sorry, Oliver.
For everything.

55:16.958 --> 55:18.542
I really did love you, you know.

55:21.958 --> 55:23.542
I still love you.

55:26.167 --> 55:27.667
I always have.

55:30.375 --> 55:32.000
I always will.

55:32.208 --> 55:34.625
[instrumental music]

55:56.583 --> 55:58.375
That was just how I remember it.

55:59.708 --> 56:02.083
I hope that's not a bad thing.

56:02.208 --> 56:03.792
Not at all.

56:19.458 --> 56:22.125
Eat up.
I'm gonna go shower.

56:22.208 --> 56:23.458
Okay.

56:25.083 --> 56:26.500
You want a coffee?

56:26.542 --> 56:28.417
[Oliver] Pods are beside
the fridge.

56:28.500 --> 56:30.000
I remember.

56:33.333 --> 56:34.750
Mm.

56:44.333 --> 56:45.750
[sighs]

56:52.125 --> 56:54.708
[suspenseful music]

57:02.000 --> 57:03.500
[Oliver] Hey, beautiful.

57:05.042 --> 57:08.333
You went for dinner with a woman
named Francesca?

57:08.417 --> 57:09.833
Ah!
[chuckles]

57:09.958 --> 57:13.625
It was a, it was a first date
and a last date.

57:15.250 --> 57:17.833
You don't have
to be bitter.

57:17.958 --> 57:22.292
Although I do find your
jealous streak adorable.

57:22.375 --> 57:25.542
And you were out with her
on Friday?

57:27.125 --> 57:31.542
Well, that, we were supposed
to go out on Friday,

57:31.625 --> 57:34.667
but I think we went out
on Thursday.

57:34.667 --> 57:36.500
You're hiding something.

57:36.542 --> 57:38.750
[chuckles]
What are you talking about?

57:42.708 --> 57:45.792
You weren't out with my dad
the night my mom was murdered.

57:47.417 --> 57:48.708
Where was my dad, Oliver?

57:50.542 --> 57:52.167
Well, if you don't tell me,
I'm gonna ask him myself.

57:52.250 --> 57:53.667
Okay.

57:53.875 --> 57:55.083
Fine.

57:56.208 --> 57:57.708
[sighs]

57:57.833 --> 58:00.792
-He was with Mia.
-Mia?

58:00.875 --> 58:03.542
Last night you swore up and down
that Mia is just a good friend.

58:03.625 --> 58:05.042
I was trying to protect him.

58:05.125 --> 58:08.583
Protect him? What about me?

58:16.083 --> 58:17.833
Where are you going?

58:17.958 --> 58:19.583
I'm going to see if the police
are interested

58:19.708 --> 58:21.708
in my dad's whereabouts
the night of my mom's death.

58:28.250 --> 58:30.125
I can't let you do that.

58:30.208 --> 58:35.875
-Get out of the way, Oliver.
-You're not going to the police.

58:38.125 --> 58:39.542
I was right to run out on you.

58:39.542 --> 58:43.208
I've worked too long
and hard for this.

58:44.875 --> 58:46.208
You're right.

58:46.292 --> 58:48.083
You're right. I'm sorry.

58:48.167 --> 58:50.583
It's okay, I was wrong.

58:50.667 --> 58:53.000
I won't go.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.500
I love you.

58:55.375 --> 58:57.042
[Oliver groans]

58:59.875 --> 59:02.833
[intense music]

59:13.625 --> 59:15.917
I want to see what's going
on here. See you inside.

59:18.208 --> 59:19.833
Morning, Oliver.

59:19.917 --> 59:21.500
You missed family dinner
last weekend.

59:21.542 --> 59:22.833
Hanging out with the ex?

59:22.875 --> 59:24.917
Yes.
I'm sorry about that, cuz.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.250
Ah, no worries.
I get it, I get it.

59:27.375 --> 59:28.625
No judgment here.

59:28.625 --> 59:31.208
We just sort of
had a disagreement.

59:32.583 --> 59:34.167
What did you do to her?

59:34.167 --> 59:35.833
I...

59:35.875 --> 59:37.958
You can tell me.
What did you do?

59:38.083 --> 59:40.125
-We...
-Ah!

59:40.125 --> 59:41.708
I'm just kidding.

59:41.792 --> 59:44.000
I'll let you know what she says.

59:44.083 --> 59:45.750
Okay, take care.

59:50.750 --> 59:53.042
Oh, I had a chat
with your boyfriend

59:53.167 --> 59:56.000
in the parking lot
before I came in. Yeah.

59:56.083 --> 59:58.417
I'm sure Oliver will have
some flowers waiting for you

59:58.417 --> 59:59.917
when you get home.

01:00:01.208 --> 01:00:02.333
[scoffs]

01:00:03.875 --> 01:00:05.708
I'm not here about Oliver.

01:00:06.625 --> 01:00:09.708
It's my father.

01:00:09.792 --> 01:00:11.833
He wasn't out for dinner at all
the night my mother died,

01:00:11.917 --> 01:00:15.083
he was... with his mistress.

01:00:16.542 --> 01:00:18.833
Okay.
I've known Paul a long time.

01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:21.500
He's a respected member
of this community.

01:00:21.583 --> 01:00:24.000
Respected members
of the community can lie.

01:00:24.167 --> 01:00:25.333
Even to the police.

01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:27.458
Wren, we've been over this.

01:00:27.542 --> 01:00:29.667
Your mother's death
was an accident.

01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:31.458
-But I have new evidence.
-Evidence of what?

01:00:31.542 --> 01:00:33.042
That y-your father
was having an affair?

01:00:33.167 --> 01:00:34.333
Yes!

01:00:34.417 --> 01:00:35.958
So if he was out
with his mistress

01:00:36.042 --> 01:00:37.542
the night of your
mother's death,

01:00:37.542 --> 01:00:39.000
he still has a solid alibi.

01:00:39.083 --> 01:00:41.333
Something just doesn't
feel right about it.

01:00:41.417 --> 01:00:43.167
If they were having an affair,

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:45.917
one of them would have wanted
my mother out of the picture.

01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:48.833
You know, we don't reopen cases
on feelings, Ms. Williams.

01:00:48.875 --> 01:00:51.042
But if you could just
question him, I think--

01:00:51.167 --> 01:00:53.083
The case is closed.

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:55.000
What about the fact
that my biological mother,

01:00:55.083 --> 01:00:57.542
Sonya Kenny, died exactly
the same way right next door?

01:00:57.667 --> 01:00:59.625
And I told you that most people

01:00:59.708 --> 01:01:01.500
die in their homes,
Ms. Williams.

01:01:01.583 --> 01:01:03.667
What are the odds
that two people die--

01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:06.500
I'm a very busy man.
It's time for you to go.

01:01:06.625 --> 01:01:08.125
Detective, there is more
to this story.

01:01:08.292 --> 01:01:09.875
There is nothing else.

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:11.875
Please, Ms. Williams.

01:01:13.333 --> 01:01:15.500
[sighs]

01:01:15.583 --> 01:01:18.292
-If you'd just listen--
-Nothing, let's go.

01:01:23.208 --> 01:01:27.375
Hey, hey, maybe it's time
you went back to the city.

01:01:27.458 --> 01:01:29.167
My family needs me here.

01:01:29.208 --> 01:01:32.667
It doesn't seem like you
being here is helping anyone.

01:01:32.708 --> 01:01:34.208
What're you doing here?

01:01:34.292 --> 01:01:36.167
Oh, I'm sorry about
all this, Paul.

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:38.500
Ah, let's you and I grab that
game of golf next week. Okay?

01:01:38.625 --> 01:01:41.000
-My treat. Yeah.
-Will do, thanks.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.583
-Wren, hey, wait.
-I don't wanna talk to you.

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:47.583
Oliver called me and told me
you were going to the police.

01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:49.500
You two are thick as thieves,
aren't you?

01:01:49.583 --> 01:01:53.583
Slow down, will you? Just, just
come back to the house with me.

01:01:53.667 --> 01:01:55.625
Where's Kayla?

01:01:55.708 --> 01:01:56.667
Brody took her to Rachel's
for the night

01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:59.042
so that you and I can talk.

01:01:59.167 --> 01:02:00.958
I'm not going anywhere with you.

01:02:01.042 --> 01:02:02.333
You stay away from me.

01:02:02.417 --> 01:02:06.708
No, wait. I'm not the bad guy
you think I am.

01:02:06.708 --> 01:02:08.208
You're hurting me.

01:02:09.708 --> 01:02:11.167
I'm-I'm sorry.

01:02:13.083 --> 01:02:14.208
I'm sorry.

01:02:29.583 --> 01:02:31.125
[clatters]

01:02:38.875 --> 01:02:41.125
[intense music]

01:02:52.875 --> 01:02:54.792
-Ahh!
-Uh! Wren!

01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:56.667
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know you were here.

01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:59.667
Oh, my God!
You scared me half to death!

01:02:59.792 --> 01:03:04.000
Sorry. I'm just on edge.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.875
Yeah, I'll say.
Is everything all right?

01:03:07.958 --> 01:03:11.333
It's been a weird 24 hours.

01:03:11.333 --> 01:03:15.208
I made a real fool of myself
last night.

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:16.625
What happened?

01:03:16.708 --> 01:03:19.167
Oh, I got way too drunk
and ran my mouth.

01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:22.333
Apparently.
I don't really remember much...

01:03:22.417 --> 01:03:24.292
Oh!

01:03:24.375 --> 01:03:26.000
Finding comfort
at the bottom of a bottle

01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:29.000
during a time like this
is pretty normal.

01:03:29.083 --> 01:03:31.625
You know what, I think
I only had one glass.

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:33.375
Are you eating enough lately?

01:03:35.167 --> 01:03:37.042
Ah, I guess not.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I totally outed my dad's affair
with Mia in front of everyone.

01:03:43.083 --> 01:03:46.833
I'm almost glad my mom wasn't
around to find out like that.

01:03:46.917 --> 01:03:49.792
[sighs]
Uh... that reminds me.

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:51.792
I think you should see this.

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:59.042
I found this the other day.

01:04:04.958 --> 01:04:06.333
So my mom knew too.

01:04:07.875 --> 01:04:09.250
I guess that's what she meant

01:04:09.333 --> 01:04:11.458
when she said Mia
stole something from her.

01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:21.542
I was just gonna go to get
something to eat.

01:04:21.667 --> 01:04:22.833
Care to join me?

01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:25.375
Mm. Thanks.

01:04:25.458 --> 01:04:28.500
I think I'm just gonna stay here
a little while longer.

01:04:40.875 --> 01:04:42.458
[sighs]

01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:59.083
[mellow music]

01:05:09.333 --> 01:05:11.250
[sniffles]

01:05:27.375 --> 01:05:29.667
[music continues]

01:05:58.125 --> 01:06:00.583
[suspenseful music]

01:06:22.625 --> 01:06:24.333
[car engine starts]

01:06:26.875 --> 01:06:29.083
[dramatic music]

01:06:32.708 --> 01:06:35.667
[Oliver] Hey! Come here!

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:36.958
Stop!

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:00.958
[gate opens]

01:07:02.167 --> 01:07:03.625
[Oliver] Wren!

01:07:05.542 --> 01:07:07.000
Just wanna talk.

01:07:10.542 --> 01:07:11.958
Come on.

01:07:12.042 --> 01:07:13.708
It's just your Oliver.

01:07:16.125 --> 01:07:17.708
[twig snaps]

01:07:20.875 --> 01:07:23.250
[Oliver] It's okay. Wren.

01:07:24.417 --> 01:07:25.792
It's okay.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.458
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

01:07:34.708 --> 01:07:37.250
[dramatic music]

01:07:43.583 --> 01:07:45.375
Get away from me, Oliver!

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.917
Can we just go back to
where we were this morning?

01:07:47.917 --> 01:07:50.875
Before or after you drugged me?

01:07:50.875 --> 01:07:52.875
Why did you do it?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.667
I did it to protect you.

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:56.375
From what?

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.125
-The truth.
-You did it to control me.

01:08:01.375 --> 01:08:03.333
You always have to
have your way.

01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:05.458
It's always about
what's best for you.

01:08:05.542 --> 01:08:08.042
You're crazy
if you believe that.

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:11.625
You know, that day
I ran out on our wedding...

01:08:11.625 --> 01:08:14.167
I couldn't have even told you
why I was running.

01:08:14.292 --> 01:08:16.375
I sat at some highway truck stop

01:08:16.375 --> 01:08:19.500
in the middle of
nowhere for hours,

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.958
punishing myself with how
I might have just walked away

01:08:22.042 --> 01:08:23.542
from a fairy tale life.

01:08:25.083 --> 01:08:27.625
I can finally see it.

01:08:27.625 --> 01:08:30.333
You are manipulative
and controlling,

01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:32.917
and even though I didn't
notice it outright back then,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.667
I could still feel you
suffocating me.

01:08:34.667 --> 01:08:36.500
I would never
tried to control you.

01:08:36.542 --> 01:08:39.500
No? You didn't manipulate me
and my family

01:08:39.583 --> 01:08:42.167
into giving you everything
you needed from us?

01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:44.792
My mother's affection,
my hand in marriage?

01:08:44.875 --> 01:08:46.417
My father's business?

01:08:46.542 --> 01:08:47.917
We could've been
so happy together.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
You don't know what that is!

01:08:51.083 --> 01:08:52.750
You don't build
a life of happiness

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:54.542
on deceit and duplicity.

01:08:54.625 --> 01:08:56.417
An architect should understand
the importance

01:08:56.417 --> 01:08:58.208
of a strong foundation.

01:09:00.083 --> 01:09:01.750
Help! Help.

01:09:01.875 --> 01:09:03.792
You're right, hey,
you're right.

01:09:03.917 --> 01:09:06.167
I-I promise I'll be better.

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:08.125
I'll rebuild
that foundation, okay?

01:09:08.208 --> 01:09:10.125
There's nothing I wanna
rebuild with you.

01:09:10.208 --> 01:09:13.000
I love you, Wren,
please don't do this.

01:09:13.125 --> 01:09:15.833
You stay away from me
and my family!

01:09:15.875 --> 01:09:17.500
Why can't you listen to me?

01:09:17.625 --> 01:09:19.500
-Ah!
-Oh!

01:09:22.042 --> 01:09:23.500
Wren!

01:09:25.542 --> 01:09:27.667
I'm not going anywhere, Wren!

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:31.250
I got your pathetic father
wrapped around my finger.

01:09:34.542 --> 01:09:38.125
I am more a part of this family
than you'll ever be!

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:41.000
[groans]

01:09:41.083 --> 01:09:42.542
Wren!

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:46.667
Wren!

01:09:49.167 --> 01:09:50.500
[knock on door]

01:09:52.208 --> 01:09:54.500
How could you steal my dad
away like that?

01:09:54.583 --> 01:09:56.875
Steal him away?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.500
He pursued me. Relentlessly.

01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:02.833
I'm surprised
you're so shocked by that.

01:10:02.875 --> 01:10:05.542
-Given your father's history.
-What are you talking about?

01:10:05.667 --> 01:10:08.667
He was having an affair
with Sonya before she died.

01:10:08.792 --> 01:10:10.708
For years.

01:10:10.792 --> 01:10:12.208
That's not possible.

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:14.417
I told Julie about
his affair with Sonya

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:17.208
so she'd finally leave Paul.

01:10:17.292 --> 01:10:19.500
And you could swoop in.

01:10:19.542 --> 01:10:22.542
He came over that night,
to ask me to marry him

01:10:22.542 --> 01:10:25.417
after he'd finally broken
the news to Julie.

01:10:25.542 --> 01:10:28.208
So you weren't together
the entire night.

01:10:28.292 --> 01:10:32.000
And you were outside creeping
around when I got here.

01:10:32.083 --> 01:10:34.167
I went out to buy a champagne.

01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:36.042
Of course, we couldn't enjoy it.

01:10:36.167 --> 01:10:38.208
There are holes in your alibi.

01:10:40.208 --> 01:10:42.458
Everyone is calling
this an accident.

01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:45.792
You know what I think?

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:49.000
I think Julie killed herself
out of grief

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.833
over having
a daughter like you.

01:10:50.958 --> 01:10:53.167
Well, it seems to me that every
woman who gets in your way

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:54.875
ends up dead in a bathtub.

01:10:58.583 --> 01:10:59.875
Homewrecker!

01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:07.625
It takes two to have
an affair, sweetheart.

01:11:20.917 --> 01:11:22.000
[Paul] Ah!

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.042
[Paul sniffles]

01:11:23.042 --> 01:11:24.625
[Paul sobbing]

01:11:51.583 --> 01:11:52.917
Headache?

01:11:54.875 --> 01:11:56.250
Oh, Wren.

01:11:57.875 --> 01:11:59.250
It's you!

01:11:59.333 --> 01:12:00.792
Get off me!

01:12:02.542 --> 01:12:04.625
How could you betray mom
like that?

01:12:04.708 --> 01:12:06.625
I, I can't help.

01:12:06.708 --> 01:12:10.875
I think that her, her
accident was my punishment.

01:12:12.417 --> 01:12:13.667
If it was your punishment,

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:15.708
she wouldn't be the one
who is dead.

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:20.625
I'm-I'm sorry I wasn't there
to save her.

01:12:22.875 --> 01:12:24.417
Please.

01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:29.292
But don't-don't tell Kayla
about Mia.

01:12:30.667 --> 01:12:32.667
She's been through enough.

01:12:32.833 --> 01:12:35.833
It has nothing to do with
protecting yourself, does it?

01:12:35.917 --> 01:12:39.542
Promise me that you,
you won't say anything.

01:12:41.583 --> 01:12:44.000
-Let me go.
-I can't.

01:12:44.083 --> 01:12:48.042
I can't let you go.
Not until you understand.

01:12:56.375 --> 01:12:57.583
Fine.

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:01.083
Let's have a drink.

01:13:01.208 --> 01:13:02.792
Yeah.

01:13:04.792 --> 01:13:08.000
I-I'll clear everything up,
I-I promise.

01:13:10.583 --> 01:13:14.083
I-I know exactly
how to fix this. I know.

01:13:14.083 --> 01:13:15.458
I should fix this.

01:13:16.375 --> 01:13:18.125
[indistinct]

01:13:29.667 --> 01:13:31.375
-[glasses clink]
-Bottoms up.

01:13:50.708 --> 01:13:51.917
Hey.

01:13:54.542 --> 01:13:56.500
You recognize this?

01:13:56.583 --> 01:13:58.375
[Paul] Oh! Sonya...

01:14:02.208 --> 01:14:03.667
Sonya?

01:14:05.958 --> 01:14:07.083
My Sonya.

01:14:09.583 --> 01:14:13.167
You, you look like you did
the day we first met.

01:14:17.083 --> 01:14:19.417
If you'd just understood that...

01:14:20.583 --> 01:14:23.292
I-I couldn't just leave Julie.

01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:27.000
Not after her father
gave me the firm.

01:14:27.125 --> 01:14:28.750
What did you do, Paul?

01:14:33.167 --> 01:14:34.958
You, you were so angry.

01:14:35.042 --> 01:14:37.417
You slipped when you came
after me.

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:43.083
Hit your head on the tap.
There was blood everywhere.

01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:47.792
And then what?

01:14:49.167 --> 01:14:52.833
You slipped under the surface.

01:14:54.875 --> 01:14:57.458
You looked so serene underwater.

01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:05.792
I-I was gonna pull you out,
I swear.

01:15:08.667 --> 01:15:11.625
But then I started thinking
how...

01:15:11.708 --> 01:15:14.125
how peaceful everything
would get.

01:15:16.167 --> 01:15:19.208
How could you be
so spineless?

01:15:22.708 --> 01:15:24.000
Wren!

01:15:25.917 --> 01:15:26.958
Oh, Wren.

01:15:27.042 --> 01:15:28.208
Wren! I-I'm sorry!

01:15:30.375 --> 01:15:32.000
Wren, please!

01:15:32.083 --> 01:15:34.458
Everything I did...

01:15:34.542 --> 01:15:36.625
was to give you
an easier life...

01:15:37.917 --> 01:15:39.542
with us.

01:15:39.542 --> 01:15:41.708
You stole me from my mother!

01:15:47.333 --> 01:15:48.833
[door opens]

01:15:52.208 --> 01:15:53.625
Brody!

01:15:57.958 --> 01:16:00.625
-I have to go to the police.
-What happened?

01:16:00.625 --> 01:16:03.333
Dad just confessed
to watching Sonya die.

01:16:03.417 --> 01:16:06.708
And I think he killed mom, too.

01:16:06.833 --> 01:16:08.875
Oh, come on.
Where is he?

01:16:08.958 --> 01:16:10.792
He's passed out in his office.

01:16:12.667 --> 01:16:14.917
I don't want go. No.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.792
[intense music]

01:16:25.167 --> 01:16:26.875
[indistinct chatter]

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:31.208
[Paul] No, you can't.
[Brody] It had to be done.

01:16:31.208 --> 01:16:32.833
[Paul] Brody!
[Brody] Shh!

01:16:32.833 --> 01:16:34.542
[Paul] No, no, I think she got--

01:16:34.625 --> 01:16:36.375
[Brody] Calm down, dad.
[Paul] No.

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:38.542
[Brody] You know
I can handle this.

01:16:46.042 --> 01:16:47.833
You killed mom?

01:16:48.833 --> 01:16:51.792
And you almost caught me!

01:16:51.875 --> 01:16:54.083
Few minutes earlier
and you might have saved her.

01:16:59.125 --> 01:17:00.708
Let me go, Brody!

01:17:02.375 --> 01:17:03.792
Why'd you have to come back?

01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:08.708
Things were so much easier
without you.

01:17:11.958 --> 01:17:14.250
Now everyone's gonna think
that the art therapist

01:17:14.375 --> 01:17:17.250
couldn't handle her own trauma.

01:17:17.375 --> 01:17:19.083
Brody, don't do this.

01:17:20.708 --> 01:17:25.833
Wren knows too much now.
Just like Julie did.

01:17:25.917 --> 01:17:29.375
Mia told Julie about
dad's affair with Sonya.

01:17:29.458 --> 01:17:33.167
And then Julie figured out that
dad was involved in her death.

01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:34.958
So you killed her.

01:17:35.042 --> 01:17:39.042
Julie was gonna go
to the police and turn dad in.

01:17:39.042 --> 01:17:42.792
After all these years,
she just couldn't let it go.

01:17:42.875 --> 01:17:46.417
I never wanted Julie to die.

01:17:46.542 --> 01:17:48.667
She was gonna ruin everything!

01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:51.708
Your life would have been over.

01:17:53.417 --> 01:17:54.875
Don't do this, Brody!

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.125
You don't need two lives
on your conscience.

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:03.917
Three, if you count
that weasel Oliver.

01:18:05.875 --> 01:18:08.292
One more won't make
a difference.

01:18:08.375 --> 01:18:09.792
[shudders]

01:18:11.792 --> 01:18:13.917
I know you can't see it
right now, dad,

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.583
but she needs to die.

01:18:16.583 --> 01:18:20.583
But, Brody, you can't kill her.

01:18:20.583 --> 01:18:22.333
She's my biological daughter!

01:18:24.125 --> 01:18:26.625
[Wren] What? Dad?

01:18:26.708 --> 01:18:28.417
What're you talking about?

01:18:28.542 --> 01:18:30.333
Sonya.

01:18:30.333 --> 01:18:32.542
She wanted to keep you.

01:18:32.542 --> 01:18:36.417
A-and since Julie
couldn't get pregnant,

01:18:36.417 --> 01:18:41.250
I knew that you were my only
chance at a real child.

01:18:41.333 --> 01:18:43.833
We don't use that word
in this family!

01:18:43.833 --> 01:18:45.292
-[Wren] No!
-Oh!

01:18:51.042 --> 01:18:52.250
But, Brody.

01:18:52.333 --> 01:18:56.042
I did everything for him
and it was never enough.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.958
I guess this explains
why you were his favorite.

01:19:01.792 --> 01:19:03.792
Brody. [groans]

01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:06.708
Oh...

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.500
[Brody] Wren!

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.375
[intense music]

01:19:14.417 --> 01:19:16.208
[grunts]

01:19:24.375 --> 01:19:25.375
No, Brody.

01:19:33.458 --> 01:19:35.292
[panting]

01:19:35.375 --> 01:19:37.667
Leave her alone, Brody!

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:40.083
Stay out of this.
This is between me and Wren.

01:19:41.792 --> 01:19:44.208
-Oh, God!
-[grunts]

01:19:50.167 --> 01:19:51.750
Kayla!

01:19:51.833 --> 01:19:54.417
-I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:19:54.542 --> 01:19:57.167
-You?
-[panting]

01:19:58.542 --> 01:20:00.667
[both sobbing]

01:20:00.708 --> 01:20:03.292
[mellow music]

01:20:07.333 --> 01:20:09.500
[indistinct chatter]

01:20:28.042 --> 01:20:29.667
Paul!

01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:31.333
Paul!

01:20:32.542 --> 01:20:33.792
What's going on?

01:20:35.542 --> 01:20:39.583
What did you do?
Talk to me.

01:20:39.667 --> 01:20:41.042
What did you do?

01:20:56.792 --> 01:20:58.917
I'm good now.
Thank you.

01:21:00.458 --> 01:21:03.000
[instrumental music]

01:21:04.583 --> 01:21:06.333
Just give me a sec.

01:21:14.625 --> 01:21:16.333
Thank you for
calling the police.

01:21:16.417 --> 01:21:20.292
I told you. You notice a lot
if you just watch.

01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:22.250
I'm so glad you're okay.

01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:24.500
Thank you.

01:21:43.583 --> 01:21:45.083
[door shuts]

01:21:47.875 --> 01:21:49.625
[sighs]

01:21:54.125 --> 01:21:56.583
[instrumental music]

01:22:03.625 --> 01:22:06.500
Your studio's first session
tomorrow is fully booked!

01:22:06.583 --> 01:22:08.167
Oh, nice.

01:22:08.250 --> 01:22:11.500
How's it feel to be Greenville's
first art therapist?

01:22:13.208 --> 01:22:14.958
I couldn't have done this
without you, Gina.

01:22:14.958 --> 01:22:16.333
Anything for you, Wren.

01:22:16.333 --> 01:22:18.167
I hope you'll stay on with me?

01:22:18.208 --> 01:22:21.375
As my full-time
organizer extraordinaire?

01:22:22.667 --> 01:22:23.917
Mm, let's see.

01:22:23.917 --> 01:22:26.083
Of course, of course, I will!

01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:29.833
[clears throat]
Welcome aboard.

01:22:29.958 --> 01:22:31.250
Thank you.

01:22:33.958 --> 01:22:36.542
Wren, it's up!
Come on! Come look!

01:22:36.625 --> 01:22:38.125
Come on!

01:22:41.917 --> 01:22:45.042
Ah, it looks perfect.

01:22:46.583 --> 01:22:49.333
I think you're gonna be able to
help a lot of people.

01:22:49.333 --> 01:22:52.125
There's a lot of people
in this world who need help.

01:22:52.208 --> 01:22:54.042
Mom would have loved this.

01:23:02.875 --> 01:23:05.417
How about we have
a painting session

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.792
before we officially open
for business?

01:23:07.875 --> 01:23:09.875
Just you and me?

01:23:09.958 --> 01:23:11.917
[chuckles]

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
[instrumental music]

01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:45.375
[music continues]

01:24:04.542 --> 01:24:06.750

01:24:36.042 --> 01:24:38.583
