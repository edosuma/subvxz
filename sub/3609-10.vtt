00:02.003 --> 00:04.494
[radio plays]

00:32.617 --> 00:34.949
You got this thing running yet, buddy?

00:35.036 --> 00:37.618
Nah, but I got your tools all set.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.447
Let's see if we can
get this thing started, OK?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.532
I thought we needed a new carburetor?

00:42.627 --> 00:45.790
Well, maybe we don't.
Come on, slide behind the wheel.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.120
Let's fire this up.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.546
What's the matter? Go ahead.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.634
[takes deep breath]

01:06.776 --> 01:09.609
[engine revs, doesn't start]

01:13.658 --> 01:17.242
This is stupid. Without a new
carburetor, it's not gonna work.

01:17.328 --> 01:19.410
Having hope is never stupid.

01:19.497 --> 01:22.830
You gotta believe good things
will happen, and then they will.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.999
Understand what I'm saying?

01:25.670 --> 01:27.877
In this world, son,

01:27.964 --> 01:30.171
you gotta make your own luck.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.340
All right? All right. Come on.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.968
Well... what are you
gonna fix today?

01:42.436 --> 01:44.927
We'll have to put that
on hold for a little while

01:45.022 --> 01:48.435
'cause... I gotta go to Vegas.

01:48.526 --> 01:50.608
I got some work out there.

01:50.695 --> 01:52.560
What about the road trip?

01:52.655 --> 01:56.614
The Grand Canyon will still be there
when I get back, little dude. [laughs]

01:56.701 --> 01:58.862
Hey, I got something for you.

01:59.662 --> 02:01.903
I'm not supposed to, Mom says.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.947
Live a little, Hugo.
It's just a candy bar, OK?

02:08.379 --> 02:10.870
All right. I'll be back
before you know it.

02:10.965 --> 02:12.626
- Hold down the fort?
- All right.

02:12.717 --> 02:14.628
You're my man? All right.

02:26.188 --> 02:28.179
[engine starts]

02:59.638 --> 03:03.051
So then the Others
take the bags off our heads

03:03.142 --> 03:05.758
and we were, like,
on the other side of the island.

03:05.853 --> 03:09.141
And... they take Jack,
Kate and Sawyer someplace,

03:09.231 --> 03:13.600
and they sent me back
to warn everyone to stay away...

03:14.779 --> 03:17.486
...Which I did and...

03:17.573 --> 03:20.315
...now everyone's freaked out.

03:20.409 --> 03:23.947
With them gone and...
what happened to Eko...

03:25.247 --> 03:27.454
...they're all scared.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.081
And I'm scared.

03:36.092 --> 03:37.832
But then, I've...

03:38.886 --> 03:41.719
...been scared most of
my time here anyway.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.306
Except when I'm with you.

03:54.443 --> 03:56.820
I miss you, Libby.

04:18.843 --> 04:20.299
Bloody hell.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.430
- Dude, you OK?
- Peachy.

04:23.514 --> 04:26.347
Really? Because you've kind of
been moping the last...

04:26.434 --> 04:28.766
Look, it's not worth
talking about, Hurley.

04:28.853 --> 04:31.310
Dude, you can tell me anything.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.277
Desmond...

04:38.404 --> 04:40.065
...said I was gonna die.

04:40.739 --> 04:44.277
He told me he has these flashes...
visions, whatever.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.734
And in them, I always die.

04:52.168 --> 04:54.625
So this is the part where...

04:54.712 --> 04:58.751
...you tell me, "It is ridiculous.
Don't be daft. He's a nutter."

04:59.675 --> 05:02.382
I think he might be right.

05:02.970 --> 05:06.679
- And I think it might be my fault.
- Your fault?

05:08.058 --> 05:09.764
I'm kind of cursed.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.222
Death finds me, dude.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.225
[barking]

05:19.695 --> 05:21.276
Vincent?

05:23.574 --> 05:25.565
Is that an arm?

05:31.081 --> 05:33.163
Here, Vincentl
Come here! Vincentl

05:33.250 --> 05:35.161
I think we need to get that.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.241
Yeah.

05:36.337 --> 05:39.625
Chase the dog with the skeletal arm
into the jungle, be my guest!

05:39.715 --> 05:41.171
Uh, OK.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.670
If I'm not back in three hours,
tell somebody.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.597
Vincent!

05:54.271 --> 05:56.262
Vincent, come here!

06:09.036 --> 06:10.276
Vincent.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.038
[Vincent whimpers]

06:19.964 --> 06:20.953
[barking]

06:32.601 --> 06:33.681
[barking]

06:36.272 --> 06:37.808
Vincent.

06:53.998 --> 06:55.704
Awesome.

07:13.809 --> 07:17.097
[woman] It's everyone's fantasy,
winning the lottery,

07:17.187 --> 07:20.395
untold millions falling
into your lap overnight.

07:20.482 --> 07:23.019
What would you do with all that money?

07:23.110 --> 07:25.396
One such lucky winner recently bought...

07:25.487 --> 07:26.943
...a chicken shack.

07:27.031 --> 07:29.397
|'m Tricia Tanaka, with Hugo Reyes,

07:29.491 --> 07:33.075
winner of a record $114 million,

07:33.162 --> 07:36.199
outside Mr. Cluck's
Chicken Shack in Diamond Bar

07:36.290 --> 07:39.077
which will be having
its grand re-opening tomorrow.

07:39.168 --> 07:42.456
So, Hugo, |think the question
on everyone's mind is,

07:42.546 --> 07:44.832
why did you buy Mr. Cluck's?

07:44.923 --> 07:45.912
Uh...

07:48.177 --> 07:50.293
I like chicken?

07:52.848 --> 07:56.761
Um, also with us
is, uh, Hugo's former boss,

07:56.852 --> 07:59.639
and now employee, Randy Nations.

07:59.730 --> 08:04.064
That's probably every working stiff's
fantasy, isn't it, Mr. Reyes?

08:07.404 --> 08:10.771
Um... OK, so, Hugo,
tell us what else you've done

08:10.866 --> 08:13.448
since you got on your lucky streak.

08:13.535 --> 08:16.197
Actually, I've kind of had
some bad luck, too.

08:16.288 --> 08:19.496
My grandpa, Tito,
died of a heart attack.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.165
And the first house
I bought my mom burnt down.

08:22.252 --> 08:25.085
My friend Johnny ran off
with my girlfriend Starla.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.413
This guy jumped off
my accountant's roof.

08:27.508 --> 08:28.668
- Cut!
- The...

08:30.052 --> 08:32.759
What the hell was that?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.337
It's a puff piece.
Do you know what that is?

08:36.975 --> 08:38.715
Yeah.

08:38.811 --> 08:40.927
Sorry, Tricia Tanaka.

08:41.647 --> 08:44.684
Um, do you mind if we go inside
and shoot some B-roll?

08:45.943 --> 08:48.104
- I don't know...
- Yeah, of course you can.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.858
I mean, he's just superstitious.
You know, the ribbon isn't cut yet.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.314
OK, let's go.

08:53.409 --> 08:56.867
Oh! God, I hate this!
| always get the stupid stories!

08:56.954 --> 09:00.663
- Hey. You sure it's OK?
- Yeah, relax.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.660
The safety guards are on the fryers?

09:02.751 --> 09:06.209
Those fryers are stone cold.
We don't start cooking until tomorrow.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.504
- You hear something?
- [whizzing]

09:09.591 --> 09:11.001
And then pan through the...

09:11.093 --> 09:12.799
[whizzing gets louder]

09:20.519 --> 09:22.760
[car alarms blaring]

10:00.976 --> 10:03.934
Well, we're out of Dharma oat bars.

10:04.021 --> 10:05.727
- Already?
- Yep.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.896
- Did you check behind the milk?
- Yeah.

10:07.983 --> 10:10.349
Will you pass me the box of cereal?

10:10.444 --> 10:12.560
[Nikki] Oh. Then I guess
we're out of it.

10:12.654 --> 10:16.021
Will you... pass me... the cereal?

10:17.993 --> 10:19.449
[speaks Korean]

10:19.536 --> 10:22.243
From now on, I will only
speak to you in English.

10:22.331 --> 10:23.946
It's how you will learn.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.453
[speaks Korean]

10:26.543 --> 10:29.080
It will be hard at first...

10:29.171 --> 10:32.959
[Hurley] Hey! Hey! Hey, everyone!

10:33.050 --> 10:34.790
- Hey!
- Hurley! What is it?

10:34.885 --> 10:36.750
[Paulo] Is it the Others?

10:36.845 --> 10:38.881
- Are you OK?
- What's going on, man?

10:39.556 --> 10:40.887
Car!

10:42.226 --> 10:43.557
I found a car...

10:43.644 --> 10:46.101
...tipped over in the jungle.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.647
You found a car...

10:51.151 --> 10:52.357
It's not far! Come on!

10:53.278 --> 10:55.109
Why do we need to start a car?

10:55.572 --> 10:58.279
Because... it'll be fun.

10:59.368 --> 11:00.323
Oh.

11:00.410 --> 11:04.073
We could all use some fun.
After everything that's happened,

11:04.164 --> 11:05.574
we need it.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.831
Especially you, dude.

11:10.212 --> 11:11.748
So who's with me?

11:13.924 --> 11:15.835
Well, I gotta cut some bananas.

11:15.926 --> 11:18.508
- Sorry.
- I don't think so, Hurley.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.421
- [Nikki] Sorry, Hurley.
- [Paulo] Good luck.

11:22.516 --> 11:25.098
Come on! Anyone?
We're gonna drive it!

11:25.185 --> 11:27.562
Who's coming?

11:36.697 --> 11:38.483
Thanks, dude.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.991
You have no idea
what you volunteered for, do you?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.076
Come on.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.201
[Sawyer] We there yet?

11:52.588 --> 11:57.503
If we are where I think we are,
our beach should be through those trees.

11:57.593 --> 11:59.800
We'll be home in about five minutes.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.003
Try to contain your excitement.

12:02.097 --> 12:06.966
I'm not excited about explaining why
there's two of us coming back, James.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.177
Maybe they should explain
why they ain't come looking for us.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.766
In fact, I'd be surprised
if Locke... Ow! Ow!

12:14.860 --> 12:16.066
What happened?

12:16.153 --> 12:18.235
- Stepped on something!
- Let me see.

12:18.322 --> 12:21.314
- Looks like a dart.
- How the hell did that get out here?

12:21.408 --> 12:24.195
Relax your foot for a second, OK?
I'm gonna pull it out.

12:24.286 --> 12:25.822
On the count of three, ready?

12:25.913 --> 12:26.993
One...

12:27.789 --> 12:28.995
Ow!

12:29.082 --> 12:32.119
- You said, "three"!
- Anticipation is the worst part.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.496
I thought I would spare you.

12:44.348 --> 12:46.805
You know, all you have
to do is say "sorry."

12:48.352 --> 12:51.435
We could start again.
Give each other a clean slate.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.312
Slate...

12:54.399 --> 12:55.730
...like on Little House?

12:56.735 --> 12:59.693
- What?
- Little House on the Prairie.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.021
Laura Ingalls wrote on
this chalkboard...

13:02.115 --> 13:03.651
You call it Little House?

13:05.661 --> 13:07.447
I had mono when I was a kid.

13:07.537 --> 13:11.246
I missed two months of school and
we only got one channel in my trailer.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.871
What are we even talking about?

13:19.716 --> 13:21.752
We ain't talking about nothing.

13:23.637 --> 13:26.879
- James...
- I ain't got nothing to be sorry for.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.137
So that's how it's gonna be?

13:35.732 --> 13:37.984
Welcome home, Sawyer.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.734
[sighs] Welcome home, Kate.

14:45.427 --> 14:48.214
[woman] Hugo? Is that you, Hugo?

14:49.931 --> 14:51.887
Oh, my God.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.050
- What happened?
- Tricia Tanaka is dead.

14:55.145 --> 14:58.262
- What?
- Mr. Clucks, it got hit by a meteor.

14:59.775 --> 15:02.562
Or an asteroid.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.564
I don't know the difference,
but... it's gone.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.737
- That's crazy.
- It's not crazy.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.940
It's the money,
the numbers, |'m cursed.

15:10.035 --> 15:13.744
Tricia Tanaka is dead, and her
camera dude, and it's all my fault.

15:13.830 --> 15:14.819
Ow!

15:14.915 --> 15:18.407
- It was an accident.
- It's not an accident.

15:18.502 --> 15:20.663
It is a curse,
there's one way to stop it.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.541
- I have to go to Australia.
- Again with Australia?

15:23.632 --> 15:25.623
That's where the numbers came from.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.958
Lenny, in the institution, he told me!

15:28.053 --> 15:30.544
Hugo, Hugo, wait.

15:30.639 --> 15:33.756
I can prove to you you're not cursed.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.103
- You can?
- Yes.

15:37.187 --> 15:40.475
Come here with me.
I have to show you something.

15:41.650 --> 15:44.687
Hey,Hugo!

15:48.156 --> 15:51.944
After 17 years,
your father has returned!

15:52.035 --> 15:54.947
[man chuckling] Hey.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.576
Your mom wasn't kidding
about those candy bars.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.658
[chuckling] Just kidding.

16:05.382 --> 16:06.417
Poor”

16:07.676 --> 16:08.791
. . . Roger.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.257
Sorry about your arm, dude.

- Totally. Let's check it out.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.981
Dude, Roger was on a beer run.

16:37.873 --> 16:40.114
Man, I suck at charades.
You wanna what?

16:45.338 --> 16:47.829
Oh, you wanna take Roger out?

16:48.466 --> 16:51.674
Then turn it over... cool.
I understand!

16:56.641 --> 16:59.098
OK. On three.

17:01.271 --> 17:02.306
One...

17:03.565 --> 17:04.930
...two...

17:05.609 --> 17:06.815
...three!

17:16.620 --> 17:18.531
We'll get that later.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.291
So when's it gonna happen?

17:32.260 --> 17:36.799
- When's what gonna happen?
- Don't play stupid with me... brother.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.558
I was drunk, if I said anything...

17:42.646 --> 17:45.058
I have a right to know
when I'm gonna die.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.732
- It doesn't work like that.
- What doesn't?

17:49.819 --> 17:51.355
Hey, Oliver Twist!

17:53.240 --> 17:55.105
- Where's my stuff?
- What stuff?

17:55.200 --> 17:57.486
Oh, you know good
and damn well what stuff.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.364
I had books, food, porno,
a bottle of Scotch!

18:00.455 --> 18:03.322
Ay, apologies for the Scotch, mate.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.324
You drank it?

18:06.419 --> 18:09.331
Well, to be fair, there was three of us.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.918
Yeah, there was.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.500
You, the munchkin and who else?

18:19.975 --> 18:22.341
[speaks Korean]

18:22.435 --> 18:24.972
Oh, I got it. We're gonna tip it up.

18:25.355 --> 18:27.220
Crafty.

18:27.315 --> 18:30.352
- "Crafty"?
- Yeah. Crafty.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.899
It's like...

18:31.987 --> 18:34.228
...when you're good at... crafts.

18:36.866 --> 18:40.233
- Never mind.
- Hey! Where the hell's my stuff?

18:41.121 --> 18:43.362
- What are you doing?
- Dude! You're alive!

18:44.374 --> 18:46.865
Alive!

18:46.960 --> 18:50.452
Yeah, yeah, Snuffy.
It's good to see you too.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.626
I'll be damned,
y'all found a hippie car.

18:53.717 --> 18:54.752
Pretty cool, huh?

18:54.843 --> 18:58.210
- Sawyer!
- Jin-bo! How you doing?

18:59.306 --> 19:01.467
Good to see you.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.425
Well, look at that.
Somebody's hooked on phonics.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.268
Jack and Kate with you?
They all right?

19:07.939 --> 19:09.679
Kate's with me.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.937
But the doc, they still got him.

19:13.778 --> 19:18.112
OK. It's OK. It's gonna be all right.
Jack's gonna be all right. We all are.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.490
- Well, what a relief.
- Things are getting better.

19:21.578 --> 19:24.911
The car. You coming back safely.
It's a sign.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.534
A sign I want my stuff back.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.080
Uh-uh.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.284
That you're gonna help us
fix this thing.

19:30.378 --> 19:34.246
- And why in the hell would I do that?
- Because there's beer.

19:37.427 --> 19:39.167
Why did he say, "Don't come back"?

19:39.262 --> 19:41.469
He sacrificed himself
so we could escape.

19:41.556 --> 19:43.888
Probably didn't want it
to be for nothing.

19:43.975 --> 19:46.387
Hurley told us they
released Michael and Walt.

19:46.478 --> 19:50.016
Yeah. They gave Michael a boat.
He took off and never looked back.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.062
Did you see any other boats?

19:52.150 --> 19:56.268
No, but something tells me
they didn't give away their only one.

19:57.489 --> 20:00.856
- So they can leave the island?
- I don't know, John.

20:01.201 --> 20:04.534
This "zoo" where they held you,
is that where they live?

20:04.621 --> 20:05.986
[water bubbling]

20:06.081 --> 20:08.413
We escaped with one of them,
a kid named Karl.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.491
He said that they live on this island.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.621
He could take us,
but Sawyer let him go.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.419
- Why?
- You're gonna have to ask Sawyer.

20:16.633 --> 20:19.625
- Kate, where are you going?
- I don't care what Jack said.

20:20.512 --> 20:24.004
They've got him and we have
to get him back. I owe him that.

20:24.099 --> 20:26.385
So I'm going to get help.

20:26.476 --> 20:27.932
Help from who?

20:35.777 --> 20:37.893
Now that's a hell of a Jesus.

20:37.987 --> 20:40.729
Yes. Hugo is such a good son.

20:40.824 --> 20:43.236
He knows of my love
for the Savior...

20:43.326 --> 20:46.159
...so he commissioned
artisans in Taxco

20:46.246 --> 20:50.159
to custom carve for me
this statue in solid gold.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.750
Wow. That smells like great lasagna.

20:54.838 --> 20:58.126
The Trons made it themselves.

20:58.216 --> 21:00.582
Hugo found them in Bennigan's.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.167
Now they are our butlers.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.597
Something wrong, Hugo?

21:07.684 --> 21:10.391
Your father asked you a question, Hugo.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.272
My "father"?

21:13.356 --> 21:17.019
You're acting like he never left.
Like he hasn't been gone for 17 years!

21:17.110 --> 21:20.853
And all of the sudden he shows up?
Aren't you at least a little suspicious?

21:20.947 --> 21:24.735
I showed up because your mom called
and said you were in trouble.

21:24.826 --> 21:28.193
- What?
- All these numbers and curses.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.404
Hugo, I don't know what to do anymore.

21:30.498 --> 21:33.114
I thought you needed
a manly influence, a father,

21:33.209 --> 21:35.200
to get you to stop this nonsense.

21:35.295 --> 21:36.375
I'm not crazy!

21:36.463 --> 21:39.796
And the only reason he's back
is 'cause he wants the money.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.748
- That hurts.
- Well, guess what.

21:41.843 --> 21:44.380
There isn't gonna be any money. Ha!

21:44.471 --> 21:46.382
Mr. Tron, Lady Tron.

21:46.473 --> 21:49.886
Your services will no longer be needed.
Severance.

21:49.976 --> 21:54.015
I'm doing you a favor. It's a matter
of time before the curse gets you,

21:54.105 --> 21:57.313
and you... die, or worse.

21:58.401 --> 22:00.938
- What are you doing?
- Getting rid of it. All of it.

22:01.029 --> 22:04.647
The money. The houses. The livestock.
And I'm starting with him.

22:04.741 --> 22:07.073
No, Hugo. Yourfather is
staying with us.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.617
He's staying with us? Where?

22:09.704 --> 22:14.243
- It's been 17 years, Hugo.
- What's been 17 years?

22:19.172 --> 22:20.958
I have needs.

22:23.927 --> 22:27.419
No! No! No!
This can't be happening.

22:27.514 --> 22:30.096
He has to go! He has to!
I want him gone!

22:30.183 --> 22:31.673
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

22:31.768 --> 22:35.761
Why don't you show your father
what you have in the garage, Hugo?

22:47.867 --> 22:49.949
I can't believe it.

22:51.579 --> 22:53.285
You saved it.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.494
You saved it.

23:03.091 --> 23:04.831
[groaning]

23:05.635 --> 23:08.172
[groaning loudly]

23:11.558 --> 23:15.392
[laughing]

23:18.147 --> 23:20.479
Me first, now, come on.

23:20.817 --> 23:23.058
What the hell is up
with all this recycling?

23:23.653 --> 23:25.518
[Hurley] You got me, dude.

23:28.324 --> 23:32.317
[Sawyer] Looks like those Dharma freaks
were building some sort of dirt road.

23:32.412 --> 23:35.245
Whoo! Ha-ha! Now we're talking.

23:35.331 --> 23:39.324
[speaks Korean]

23:39.419 --> 23:42.331
Looks good to me.
The engine's fine, right?

23:42.422 --> 23:44.413
Son ofa...!

23:44.507 --> 23:48.170
- What's a head doing back here?
- That's just Roger.

23:50.013 --> 23:52.254
I'm gonna start the car now.

23:53.182 --> 23:56.140
[speaks Korean]

23:57.437 --> 23:59.769
Dude, even if you were
speaking English

23:59.856 --> 24:02.598
I wouldn't understand you.
Just relax.

24:02.692 --> 24:04.273
We're good. This'll work.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.563
I have hope.

24:11.784 --> 24:12.899
This will work.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.323
[no sound]

24:25.757 --> 24:27.042
Damn it.

24:33.389 --> 24:37.428
Ooh. It's flat and it stinks.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.054
Can you get it to work?

24:39.145 --> 24:41.477
Chill out. Let the man do his thing.

24:41.564 --> 24:44.897
That beer's been sitting there
since before Rocky ///.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.646
Maybe even II.
It's probably poison by now.

24:47.737 --> 24:50.570
Skeletor seems to like it.
Bottoms up!

24:50.657 --> 24:51.988
That's not cool, dude.

24:52.075 --> 24:55.818
That guy had a mom,
a family and friends.

24:55.912 --> 24:59.575
Oh, and a name. It's not "Skeletor."
It's "Roger Workman."

25:00.166 --> 25:02.828
It's "work man," you blockhead.

25:02.919 --> 25:05.911
That's his job. He was a Dharma janitor.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.667
Yeah, well, you should still
respect the dead.

25:08.758 --> 25:11.340
[speaks Korean]

25:11.427 --> 25:14.760
- Whoa. Can you fix it?
- No.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.759
No fix.

25:20.812 --> 25:25.647
But you have to! Can't you try, dude?
I mean, we gotta get this running!

25:25.733 --> 25:29.191
Leave the man alone. He's right. No fix.

25:29.278 --> 25:32.691
Look at that mess. There's no way
it's gonna run. How thick are you?

25:32.782 --> 25:36.195
What's your problem, man?
Why don't you want this to work?

25:36.285 --> 25:38.867
I don't care if it works.
Why is it important to you?

25:38.955 --> 25:41.037
Because we could all
use a little hope!

25:41.124 --> 25:45.413
If it's hope you're looking for, ése,
you're on the wrong damn island.

25:45.503 --> 25:47.789
Because sure as hell
ain't no hope here.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.892
[man] Come on, Hugo! Time to get up!

26:03.980 --> 26:08.314
Come on! Rise and shine, hit the deck!
We're burning daylight, let's go!

26:08.401 --> 26:09.891
Mmm.

26:09.986 --> 26:13.604
- What's with the earphones?
- It's for the noise.

26:14.240 --> 26:17.073
Well, your mother is
a very passionate woman.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.151
That is disgusting.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.746
We're going on an adventure.

26:20.830 --> 26:23.242
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- Look.

26:23.332 --> 26:25.414
Just do this one thing with me.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.913
If it doesn't work,
you can go to Australia.

26:28.004 --> 26:30.916
I won't stop you. OK?

26:31.007 --> 26:33.589
What one thing?

26:33.676 --> 26:35.462
We're gonna break the curse.

26:37.764 --> 26:42.349
- This is stupid.
- Just give her a chance, man.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.806
Cut the deck, please.

26:55.907 --> 26:58.114
You've come into
a great deal of money.

26:58.201 --> 27:00.112
You could've seen that on the news.

27:04.582 --> 27:07.119
But it hasn't brought you happiness.

27:07.210 --> 27:10.168
No, it's brought you great misfortune.

27:12.173 --> 27:14.585
She didn't see that on the news.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.171
- I'm seeing numbers.
- What numbers?

27:18.262 --> 27:21.299
Four. Eight. Fifteen.

27:21.390 --> 27:25.224
Sixteen. Twenty-three. Forty-two.

27:27.688 --> 27:30.851
There is darkness
around these numbers.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.061
Great tragedy.

27:38.407 --> 27:41.149
I'm... I'm sorry.

27:41.244 --> 27:43.030
What? What is it?

27:44.413 --> 27:47.450
Death. |t surrounds you.

27:48.084 --> 27:49.949
And...

27:50.044 --> 27:52.410
...more is coming.

27:53.923 --> 27:56.039
Your hands. Please.

27:58.261 --> 28:01.128
There is a curse on you.

28:02.265 --> 28:04.381
But it can be removed.

28:08.145 --> 28:10.636
Now, Hugo, I need you
to remove your clothes.

28:12.942 --> 28:14.933
My clothes?

28:15.027 --> 28:18.770
A curse is like an unwelcome
entity that lives inside you.

28:20.533 --> 28:22.649
And it must be exorcised.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.207
Did my dad put you up to this?

28:34.338 --> 28:36.499
- What?
- Hugo, please.

28:37.258 --> 28:40.671
I'll give you $1,000 now if you admit
my dad told you to say this.

28:40.761 --> 28:44.470
The mystic arts are not
subject to bribes. How dare you...

28:44.557 --> 28:46.798
- Ten thousand.
- Your dad put me up to it.

28:55.568 --> 28:57.559
I was just trying to help.

28:59.322 --> 29:01.062
Help who?

29:04.911 --> 29:08.620
[murmuring indistinctly]

29:08.706 --> 29:09.912
[Sawyer] Beer.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.663
- [Jin] Beer.
- Bingo. Beautiful.

29:16.964 --> 29:18.670
Car.

29:20.426 --> 29:23.042
- Car.
- OK.

29:23.804 --> 29:26.420
International House Of Pancakes.

29:27.975 --> 29:30.466
What are you doing over there?

29:30.561 --> 29:33.223
- I'm praying.
- Praying for what?

29:33.314 --> 29:34.724
Help.

29:34.815 --> 29:37.682
Well, hell, I got you
a little help right here!

29:49.705 --> 29:52.196
Dude! Hey, dude!

29:52.291 --> 29:54.452
Stop moping, come on!

29:54.543 --> 29:56.408
Not moping.

29:56.504 --> 29:57.914
- Thinking.
- Uh-uh.

29:58.005 --> 30:01.714
When people stare out at the ocean
and get quiet-like, they're moping.

30:01.801 --> 30:03.416
So get up and come with me.

30:03.511 --> 30:05.843
That car I found,
we're getting it running.

30:07.098 --> 30:08.804
What's the point?

30:09.433 --> 30:10.422
Ow!

30:10.518 --> 30:12.634
- What did you do that for?
- Snap out of it!

30:12.728 --> 30:16.391
Stop feeling sorry for yourself because
someone said you're gonna die.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.349
I've got an idea that's
gonna help us both. Now...

30:20.194 --> 30:21.980
It is dangerous.

30:22.071 --> 30:25.029
And there is a very good chance
that you will die.

30:25.116 --> 30:27.277
That's supposed to convince me to come?

30:27.368 --> 30:31.486
It is. Because if you don't die,
then we win.

30:31.580 --> 30:34.367
- Win?
- Look, I don't know about you, but...

30:34.458 --> 30:38.121
...things have really sucked for me
lately, and I could use a victory.

30:38.212 --> 30:41.625
So let's get one, dude.
Let's get this car started.

30:41.716 --> 30:45.800
Look death in the face. Say, "Whatever,
man." Let's make our own luck.

30:45.886 --> 30:47.046
What do you say?

30:53.144 --> 30:55.055
[Sawyer] "I'm sorry."

30:56.856 --> 30:59.438
"I'm sorry."

30:59.775 --> 31:01.766
OK. Nice. Keep it coming.

31:04.447 --> 31:07.280
"You were right."

31:08.117 --> 31:10.779
OK. That's two.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.485
Hit me.

31:13.414 --> 31:18.374
"Those pants don't make you look fat."

31:19.795 --> 31:23.287
Now you got it. Only three things
a woman needs to hear.

31:23.966 --> 31:27.208
- [chuckling]
- Come on! Get up. We got work to do.

31:27.303 --> 31:29.760
What's your problem, JumboTron?

31:29.847 --> 31:32.964
Shut up, red... neck... man.

31:34.852 --> 31:36.717
Touché.

31:36.979 --> 31:38.890
What's Jiminy Cricket doing here?

31:38.981 --> 31:41.313
- We need another man.
- Another man for what?

31:41.400 --> 31:44.608
- Push this car, dude.
- Push it? Push it where?

31:46.989 --> 31:48.820
Hey! [screams]

31:48.908 --> 31:50.523
[groaning]

32:10.971 --> 32:12.177
[pulls emergency brake]

32:12.264 --> 32:14.346
[sighs]

32:25.820 --> 32:28.687
Oh, this is gonna be real good.

32:33.786 --> 32:36.072
So you're going to Australia, huh?

32:38.374 --> 32:42.583
- Long way to go because of numbers.
- I'd really like you to leave.

32:44.421 --> 32:46.958
When your mom called me
about the lottery,

32:47.049 --> 32:49.961
I was on my bike
before she could hang the phone up.

32:51.929 --> 32:54.045
I'm getting old.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.631
Yeah, I saw my retirement.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.389
You're right.

33:02.773 --> 33:04.934
I'm here for the money.

33:06.652 --> 33:08.153
You're not getting any of it.

33:08.237 --> 33:11.195
Well, that's not why
I'm here talking to you now.

33:12.241 --> 33:14.072
I'm here talking to you now because

33:14.160 --> 33:17.527
going to Australia
is not gonna break any curse.

33:18.038 --> 33:20.415
You don't need to leave. You just...

33:21.876 --> 33:24.367
You need a little hope.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.746
We make our own luck, Hugo.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.008
- You know what I think you should do?
- What?

33:34.555 --> 33:38.764
I think you should give away
the money. All of it. Every penny.

33:40.186 --> 33:43.804
Just save enough for a new carburetor.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.232
Work on the Camaro.

33:49.320 --> 33:52.153
You know, just you and me.

33:52.239 --> 33:56.357
Take it off the blocks and make
that road trip to the Grand Canyon.

34:00.456 --> 34:02.572
Never too late for a fresh start.

34:12.009 --> 34:14.295
I'll send you a postcard from Sydney.

34:18.265 --> 34:19.926
Hey. |'||..

34:21.310 --> 34:23.141
I'll be here when you get back.

34:29.818 --> 34:33.060
[Sawyer] Are you nuts?
You're not gonna drive down that!

34:34.490 --> 34:36.321
We're gonna jump start it.

34:37.326 --> 34:41.410
You guys push it. On the way down I'm
gonna pop the clutch and get it started.

34:41.497 --> 34:43.112
You see those rocks?

34:43.207 --> 34:46.199
All you're gonna do
is crash into those real fast...

34:46.293 --> 34:47.874
...if you don't roll first.

34:47.962 --> 34:50.874
- Hurley, no.
- Dudes, I know how to drive.

34:52.258 --> 34:54.920
Now, come on, just push me,
this will work. I know it.

34:56.178 --> 34:59.341
And what are you out here for,
to watch him crash and burn?

35:04.103 --> 35:05.639
I came to ride shotgun.

35:14.655 --> 35:16.145
Well, it's your funeral.

35:16.991 --> 35:18.947
Come on, let's give them their ride.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.536
Are you sure you wanna do this?

35:26.583 --> 35:28.198
Victory or death.

35:36.010 --> 35:37.466
Push!

35:42.808 --> 35:45.800
[Sawyer, Jin groaning]

35:59.908 --> 36:02.240
- Whoa!
- Dude, careful, now!

36:03.871 --> 36:05.452
[Hurley] Here goes!

36:08.709 --> 36:10.074
[both] Whoa!

36:16.383 --> 36:18.248
And now would be a good time, Hurley!

36:19.720 --> 36:21.585
- Like right now!
- There is no curse.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.341
You make your own luck!

36:23.432 --> 36:26.424
Make your own luck...
there's no curse!

36:38.197 --> 36:39.528
[engine starts]

36:39.615 --> 36:42.197
[radio playing]

36:42.284 --> 36:44.070
[screaming]

36:54.213 --> 36:56.704
_ [Hurley, Charlie laughing]
- Son of a bitch.

36:56.799 --> 36:58.130
Hurley!

36:59.093 --> 37:01.800
[music continues]

37:12.106 --> 37:13.812
Hey, hold up!

37:23.909 --> 37:25.649
All right, come on!

37:30.791 --> 37:33.658
[all cheering]

37:33.752 --> 37:35.788
[both] Whoo!

39:26.615 --> 39:29.573
[no audio]

40:03.777 --> 40:05.893
[rustling]

40:17.040 --> 40:22.034
Kate, if you were looking for help,
why didn't you ask us?

40:22.129 --> 40:25.371
You don't know where to look,
and you're not motivated.

40:25.465 --> 40:27.501
And I don't blame you.

40:27.593 --> 40:31.427
Why would you go trek across the island,
risk more lives to get Jack back?

40:31.513 --> 40:34.596
- You're wrong.
- Oh, really? Why didn't you come...?

40:34.683 --> 40:37.846
Not about the motivation,
just about knowing where to look.

40:37.936 --> 40:41.053
We got a compass bearing.
And I'm pretty sure if we follow it,

40:41.148 --> 40:43.764
- it'll lead us right to them.
- How?

40:43.859 --> 40:48.649
Because of the way the sunlight hit Mr.
Eko's stick when John was burying him.

40:50.657 --> 40:53.273
Now you know our secret,
how about you tell us yours?

40:53.368 --> 40:54.778
[gunfire]

40:54.870 --> 40:56.906
No,no,no!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

40:57.956 --> 40:59.787
It's all right! It's safe!

41:00.125 --> 41:02.036
We're just here to talk!

41:03.879 --> 41:05.585
You can come out!

41:31.239 --> 41:32.854
What are you doing here?

41:34.284 --> 41:36.195
I came to ask for your help.

41:37.746 --> 41:41.830
- To do what?
- I'm heading to the Others' camp.

41:41.917 --> 41:45.159
And if I'm gonna find it,
I need someone who knows the island.

41:46.421 --> 41:49.208
What makes you think
I have an interest in helping you?

41:51.927 --> 41:54.919
Because they had me,
and they would've never let me go.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.846
They probably would've killed me
if I hadn't escaped.

41:58.600 --> 42:01.512
And the girl who helped me escape...

42:02.854 --> 42:04.810
...she was about 16 years old...

42:08.110 --> 42:09.941
...and her name was Alex.

42:12.114 --> 42:14.400
I'm pretty sure
that she's your daughter.
