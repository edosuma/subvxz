WEBVTT

00:21.155 --> 00:22.556
(UPBEAT MUSIC
PLAYING ON RADIO)

00:38.772 --> 00:40.574
Titans! Exciting news!

00:40.608 --> 00:45.045
I've just installed a heated
hydrotherapy chamber.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.415
Not exciting, bro.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.583
Would you be more excited,
if I told you it was a...

00:50.818 --> 00:52.286
ALL: Hot tub!

00:52.320 --> 00:53.854
Now, the hydrotherapy chamber

00:53.887 --> 00:56.490
is only for
post training soreness.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.126
Let us do the time
of the party

00:58.159 --> 01:00.228
in a large container
of warm water.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.330
The jets feel like
tiny florthogs

01:02.363 --> 01:04.165
nibbling at your norbobs.

01:04.198 --> 01:05.566
Bubbles.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.636
-Everyone out!
The tub is for...
-Hot tub!

01:09.837 --> 01:11.639
At least you respect
my orders.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.708
Oh, it's not that.
It's not that at all.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.210
It's because I...

01:16.244 --> 01:18.846
...can't enjoy hot tubs!

01:20.481 --> 01:22.683
A robot body is great
for a lot of things.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.118
Looking real shiny.

01:24.152 --> 01:27.455
-Hacking Robin's
very personal data files.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.457
-And being real,
real, real tough.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.259
But enjoying the warm
bubbly embrace

01:31.292 --> 01:33.194
of a hot tub
just isn't one of 'em.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.596
Sometimes, I wish
I was a real boy again.

01:35.629 --> 01:38.266
But I've searched the world
and there's simply
nobody who can...

01:38.299 --> 01:40.368
-Pfft! I can do that.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.703
I can make you human again,

01:42.736 --> 01:44.505
'cause, you know, magic.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.274
Why didn't you ever
say anything before?

01:46.307 --> 01:48.409
Come on, it would take
way too long to list

01:48.442 --> 01:50.344
everything I can do
with magic.

01:50.378 --> 01:53.147
-We want to hear the list.
Fine.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.715
Teleportation,
telekinesis, fly,

01:54.748 --> 01:56.684
read the minds
of animals, see in the dark,

01:56.717 --> 01:58.719
turn water into any other
liquid except
for ginger ale...

02:00.454 --> 02:02.190
...summon meteors,
devour the souls of the wicked

02:02.223 --> 02:05.193
and perfectly
crack open walnuts.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.895
-ALL: Wow!
-Walnuts are hard to open.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.397
Okay, enough yammering.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.365
I got some hot tubbing to do!

02:12.666 --> 02:13.401
Is this going to hurt?

02:13.434 --> 02:17.171
Nope, I won't feel
a thing. Ha!

02:17.205 --> 02:18.639
And you guys
say I'm not funny.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.741
But seriously, this will be
extremely painful.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.710
-Azarath Metrion Zinthos!

02:28.949 --> 02:30.918
CYBORG: The agony!
The agonizing...

02:30.951 --> 02:33.421
The agonizing agony!

02:43.497 --> 02:46.334
Raven, you did it!
I'm human again!

02:46.367 --> 02:48.436
Now, I have to warn you,
your human nervous system

02:48.469 --> 02:50.771
is very sensitive
compared to your robot body.

02:50.804 --> 02:54.475
All I'm hearing is hot tub!
Hot, hot, hot, hot tub!

02:59.313 --> 03:02.883
I'm being cooked alive!

03:04.552 --> 03:08.256
Why was the hot tub so hot?

03:08.289 --> 03:09.557
Because you're human

03:09.590 --> 03:11.625
and humans feel
way more pain than robots.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.562
Yeah, sorry, Cyborg,
but it's... Hang on. Wow!

03:14.595 --> 03:17.231
We can't even call you
Cyborg anymore, can we?

03:17.265 --> 03:18.699
-Yeah, bro.

03:18.732 --> 03:22.303
You're just a fleshy guy now.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.737
Fleshy Guy!

03:23.771 --> 03:25.373
That can be your new name.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.741
Man, I'm so great
at naming things.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.377
I'm not sure I want to be...

03:29.410 --> 03:30.778
-Fleshy Guy.
-The Flesh Guy.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.013
You don't want to be
a Cyborg again, do you?

03:33.046 --> 03:36.817
No, I just have a lot
to learn about being
a real boy, that's all.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.487
That's the spirit, Fleshy Guy.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.989
I'll be your guide
to being a human.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.491
Just follow me.

03:58.406 --> 03:59.807
You still like food?

03:59.840 --> 04:03.311
Well, you're going to love it
even more, Fleshy Guy!

04:09.650 --> 04:12.586
These snacks taste so much
better in my human belly!

04:12.620 --> 04:14.555
That's what I'm saying,
Fleshy Guy.

04:29.437 --> 04:32.640
This is so good!

04:32.673 --> 04:34.775
If you think that's good,

04:34.808 --> 04:36.410
wait till you try this!

04:38.946 --> 04:41.882
Once every 300 years,

04:41.915 --> 04:45.653
all major food groups
align in the cosmos.

04:45.686 --> 04:50.023
Taco, burger, hot dog, pizza,

04:50.057 --> 04:52.526
all coming together as one

04:52.560 --> 04:57.698
to form El Burdigato Supreme!

04:58.399 --> 05:00.067
Oh...

05:00.100 --> 05:02.370
My human belly.

05:02.403 --> 05:05.339
Huh, maybe we overdid it
just a little.

05:08.442 --> 05:11.011
-That's the Burdigato.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.923
CYBORG: Hey, Beasty,
can you come
in here for a second?

05:22.956 --> 05:25.593
Why?
You need help?

05:27.595 --> 05:29.697
What are you doing
with your feet in there?

05:29.730 --> 05:32.132
It's been a while since
I've used one of these, okay!

05:44.177 --> 05:46.013
Great first day, Fleshy Guy.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.648
Isn't being a human awesome?

05:47.681 --> 05:51.652
Why is it so hard
to move my body?

05:51.685 --> 05:54.855
'Cause you're tired, dude.
Happens to all of us.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.890
You just need to recharge
your batteries.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.726
That I can do!

06:03.196 --> 06:06.400
I can see
where you might have
misunderstood me there.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.739
Good morning, the Flesh Guy.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.874
Ah, you decided
to sleep in, huh?

06:13.907 --> 06:16.577
Sleep in?
I barely slept at all.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.912
This human body
just keeps sloshing around

06:18.946 --> 06:20.514
and making weird noises.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.883
Today, I just want to relax
and read comic books.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.685
Ow, what happened?

06:24.718 --> 06:26.086
That is a cut of the paper.

06:26.119 --> 06:29.056
It happens to those of us
without metal hands.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.958
Well, I don't like it.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.460
-Ow!

06:33.794 --> 06:35.596
BEAST BOY: Got to
watch those toes, bro.

06:35.629 --> 06:38.432
What is wrong with your
weird soft bodies?

06:38.466 --> 06:40.901
I can't take this anymore!

06:40.934 --> 06:42.836
I... I can't-I can't...

06:45.939 --> 06:47.475
Poor, the Fleshy Guy.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.677
I feel sad about his sad.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.645
Maybe I should go
check on him.

06:51.679 --> 06:54.181
No, this is
a real boy problem.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.949
It should be handled by...

06:55.983 --> 06:57.651
A real boy!

06:59.520 --> 07:01.555
I just want...

07:08.962 --> 07:10.464
I want my face back...

07:12.933 --> 07:15.903
Hey, is there a real boy
in here that needs
cheering up?

07:18.338 --> 07:21.509
Hey, hey, Fleshy Guy,
being a human boy
isn't that bad, you know.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.943
Are you kidding?
It's horrible!

07:22.976 --> 07:25.546
I can't imagine anybody
living a single day like this.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.981
Oh, right, sorry.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.050
Sure, we humans can't fly

07:30.083 --> 07:32.953
or lift cars or reach
the top shelf
without a step ladder.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.155
I can reach it just fine.
You're short.

07:35.188 --> 07:38.592
Hmm. There are plenty
of really awesome things
about being human.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.093
So go back
to being a robot

07:40.127 --> 07:41.595
if you want, but first,

07:41.629 --> 07:44.565
let me take you
on a Real Boy Adventure.

07:44.598 --> 07:47.034
MAN: Real Boy Adventure!

07:47.067 --> 07:49.570
-That sounds weird.
I don't think so.

07:49.603 --> 07:52.172
* You could wear sweet
pocket protector
* Real Boy

07:52.205 --> 07:54.808
* Walk through
a metal detector
* Real Boy

07:54.842 --> 07:57.044
* You can write
your name in snow
* Real Boy

07:57.077 --> 07:59.713
* Let your finger nails grow
* Real Boy

07:59.747 --> 08:02.115
* I'm a boy,
a really real boy

08:02.149 --> 08:04.518
* I'm a boy,
a real cool boy

08:04.552 --> 08:06.720
* I'm a boy,
a really real boy

08:06.754 --> 08:08.889
* I'm a boy,
a real cool boy

08:08.922 --> 08:11.091
* You can catch
an awesome tan
* Real Boy

08:11.124 --> 08:13.661
* Play in a big belly band
* Real Boy

08:15.162 --> 08:18.131
* You can dance all night
in the rain
* Real Boy

08:18.165 --> 08:21.268
* Did you know Bruce Wayne
is a real real boy?

08:21.301 --> 08:23.070
And he's the Batman.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.639
* I'm a boy,
a really real boy

08:25.673 --> 08:27.875
* I'm a boy,
a real cool boy

08:27.908 --> 08:30.143
* I'm a boy,
a really real boy

08:30.177 --> 08:32.680
* I'm a boy,
a real cool boy

08:32.713 --> 08:33.947
* Real Boy

08:35.082 --> 08:36.516
* Real Boy

08:37.117 --> 08:39.853
* Real Boy

08:39.887 --> 08:42.690
Man, I never knew
what I was missing as a robot.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.658
Guess I don't need
these anymore.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.030
Crime alert!

08:50.063 --> 08:51.965
It is coming from...

08:51.999 --> 08:52.833
The yard?

08:52.866 --> 08:55.569
They're trying
to steal our hot tub!

08:56.604 --> 08:58.606
CYBORG:
Drop the hot tub, creeps!

08:58.639 --> 09:01.141
Whoa, Cyborg, what happened?

09:01.174 --> 09:04.845
Cyborg's gone.
I'm Fleshy Guy!

09:04.878 --> 09:07.047
ROBIN: I think
he was talking to me.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.749
Booyah!

09:08.782 --> 09:10.317
Robin, what are you doing?

09:10.350 --> 09:13.721
You heard me, Booyah!

09:13.754 --> 09:14.888
Stop saying my catch phrase!

09:14.922 --> 09:17.090
Sorry, it's my
catch phrase now.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.325
It comes with the suit.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.093
So the Real Boy Adventure,
the song,

09:20.127 --> 09:22.129
was all that just to
get my robot parts?

09:22.162 --> 09:23.797
Uh, yeah.

09:23.831 --> 09:26.600
Why would I ever be human
when I can have rocket boots?

09:27.234 --> 09:28.869
Rocket boots!

09:29.937 --> 09:32.005
Uh, sorry, still working out
some of the bugs.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.942
Now, H.I.V.E, prepare to...

09:41.749 --> 09:44.117
Don't hurt me!
I'm just a weak,
little real boy.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.890
Just like you!

09:55.863 --> 09:57.931
Sorry, babe.
Put some ice on that.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.204
Ha! Whoa!

10:07.941 --> 10:10.878
Ahhh! Too hot!
Too hot hot tub!

10:10.911 --> 10:12.913
Now that's what I call a...

10:14.815 --> 10:17.718
Real Boy Adventure!
