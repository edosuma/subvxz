00:02.669 --> 00:06.002
Great dragon:
In a land of myth and a time of magic...

00:06.173 --> 00:08.084
The destiny of a great kingdom...

00:08.258 --> 00:11.125
Rests on the shoulders
of a young man.

00:11.303 --> 00:14.045
His name: Merlin.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.561
What a pleasure it is
to see you again, Ari.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.858
The honor is all mine, my lady.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.699
Your arrival has been keenly anticipated,
I can assure you.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.706
I have boasted of your powers...

00:42.876 --> 00:45.492
- Mm.
Morgana: Though not all believe.

00:47.256 --> 00:49.338
People may believe as they wish.

00:49.508 --> 00:53.342
Well, perhaps some small proof
of your talents is in order.

00:53.512 --> 00:55.594
After all, seeing is believing,
is it not?

00:55.764 --> 00:59.222
I'm not an entertainer, my lady.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.133
Heh-heh of course not.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.222
Think of it more
as a demonstration.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.888
Extinguish those flames.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.772
- My lady, I must protest.
- Indulge me.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.945
Morgana: Impressive, indeed.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.736
Who here now
could deny your powers?

01:35.721 --> 01:37.712
Not this.

01:41.977 --> 01:45.890
Please. Morgana, my lady,
I beg of you.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.814
I'm begging you!

02:14.593 --> 02:16.925
No

02:17.888 --> 02:19.298
Mordred: Is he dead?

02:19.473 --> 02:22.055
I wanted him dead,
I would've put a sword in his gut.

02:24.728 --> 02:28.186
Don't despair, Ari.
We're nearly done.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.187
If you'd do me the favor
of relighting those fires.

02:32.361 --> 02:35.819
You know I cannot.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.321
For the benefit of my friends.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.697
I will not humiliate
myself before you.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.786
You will if you want
to see your family alive.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.802
Again!

03:01.973 --> 03:04.009
If you please.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.231
Mordred: He was a loyal soldier.

03:21.410 --> 03:24.948
In robbing him of his magic
you've lost yourself a powerful ally.

03:25.122 --> 03:29.035
Perhaps. But now we know
the war can be won.

03:30.293 --> 03:34.536
For Arthur is nothing without emrys
and emrys is nothing without magic.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.935
Three.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.192
All right.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.155
- Feel free to retire at any time now.
- I ikewise

04:43.325 --> 04:46.567
it's no disgrace for a servant
to lose to his king.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.657
- Or a king to his servant.
Crowd: Ha, ha!

04:49.831 --> 04:51.867
Crowd: Ooh!

04:56.046 --> 04:58.537
Mmm. Watch out. Here we go.

05:00.091 --> 05:03.299
Ten. Crowd: Yay!

05:05.180 --> 05:09.093
Enjoy this moment, Merlin,
while it lasts.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.379
Twelve.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.000
Crowd: Ooh!

05:45.178 --> 05:47.544
- You put me off.
- What are you talking about?

05:47.722 --> 05:49.587
You just coughed.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.724
- I was clearing my throat.
- You just coughed deliberately.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.350
I knew you'd discover
my secret in the end.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.390
There is just no fooling you, my lord.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.110
Merlin: All right.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.331
It's like that, is it?

06:28.680 --> 06:30.295
Twelve.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.137
Ha-ha! Whoo-hoo!

06:59.920 --> 07:01.035
Oh.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.850
Merlin

08:03.024 --> 08:04.889
(saius.

08:05.068 --> 08:08.435
Y-y-your head.

08:09.948 --> 08:12.439
You... you should get that seen to.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.878
Gaius: Merlin.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.552
What happened?

08:36.558 --> 08:38.765
What was that thing?

08:38.934 --> 08:42.143
Morgana's work. That's for sure.

08:42.313 --> 08:45.396
Mordred would have told her
of your powers by now, Merlin.

08:45.567 --> 08:48.980
It was only a matter of time
before she struck out.

08:49.154 --> 08:53.488
We can only be grateful
that she failed.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.425
(Saius.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.601
I don't think she failed.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.640
Whatever do you mean?

09:31.446 --> 09:33.061
I've lost my magic.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.961
I ook here.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.665
It is the sign of the gean canach.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.084
Merlin: Gean canach?

09:56.262 --> 09:58.503
That's the language
of the old religion, isn't it?

09:58.681 --> 10:02.048
Indeed. The gean canach is
a fearsome creature

10:02.227 --> 10:05.719
forged by the tears
of the earth mother nemaine.

10:05.897 --> 10:11.642
It devours the magic of others,
draining them of their power.

10:15.824 --> 10:20.284
I thought all such creatures
were destroyed in the great purge.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.238
All but one, it would seem.

10:28.044 --> 10:31.582
Mordred:
The Garrison is surrounded, my lady.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.748
Good. Are you ready?

10:36.302 --> 10:37.633
I'm ready.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.285
- Come here, pretty one!
- Help! Help me!

11:11.462 --> 11:14.545
Let her go.
She's not your enemy. I am.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.973
We cannot hold them!
Sound the retreat!

11:33.151 --> 11:34.732
Send word to Camelot!

11:57.800 --> 12:00.667
Gaius:
The Garrison at stawell was attacked.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.006
- Morgana?
- It would seem so.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.887
It cannot be a coincidence.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.300
She has picked the moment
you are most helpless to begin her attack.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.719
- What am I going to do?
- For the moment.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.354
You're going to help me
treat the wounded.

12:13.524 --> 12:16.231
Your skill as a physician
is still valid.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.116
Sorry. Almost done.

12:26.621 --> 12:29.112
Don't worry.
Merlin knows what he's doing.

12:33.002 --> 12:36.665
Do you have any news from stawell?
Have you heard from my family?

12:41.511 --> 12:44.674
Eira, your family...

12:46.683 --> 12:48.139
The people of your town...

12:49.686 --> 12:52.393
You're the only one
who survived the attack.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.929
I alone?

12:59.070 --> 13:00.435
Gwaine: I'm sorry.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.858
Eira, whatever happens...

13:08.079 --> 13:09.990
You'll be safe here in Camelot.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.663
You have my word.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.539
Thank you.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.878
Leon: A force of saxons, sire.

13:23.052 --> 13:26.340
They crossed the northern border last night
and attacked the Garrison at stawell.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.175
They march
under morgana's command?

13:28.349 --> 13:30.214
Gwaine:
There can be no doubt about it, sire.

13:30.393 --> 13:33.430
It was not just men we faced, but sorcery.

13:35.273 --> 13:38.113
Arthur: We shouldn't be surprised.
She's been massing an army for weeks.

13:38.276 --> 13:41.518
Now, with stawell taken,
she has 3 base at our northern border.

13:41.696 --> 13:44.049
- Which can only mean one thing.
- She means to take Camelot.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.530
Then she's already
made her first mistake.

13:46.701 --> 13:49.534
Leon: We have sufficient time
to prepare our defenses, sire.

13:49.704 --> 13:52.867
We can make our stand here.
However great her army...

13:53.041 --> 13:56.374
The walls of Camelot will hold.
The citadel will not fall.

13:56.544 --> 13:59.081
Perhaps. Perhaps not.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.746
We've already deserted stawell.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.524
I won't forsake the people of this land
while we take refuge here.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.089
But we can protect them here,
sire, in Camelot itself.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.551
Some, but not all.
Countless men, women and children...

14:10.725 --> 14:12.966
Will be left behind,
people who I've vowed to protect.

14:13.144 --> 14:16.477
We cannot save everyone, Arthur,
no matter how much we may wish it.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.184
There is a way.

14:24.322 --> 14:25.732
One way alone.

14:25.907 --> 14:30.526
We ensure that she never
makes it this far.

14:30.703 --> 14:34.446
We ride out and meet them?

14:34.624 --> 14:36.865
Arthur: Man to man.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.625
But sire, morgana commands
an army of thousands.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.833
Nonetheless, it's our duty
as protectors of this land.

14:43.007 --> 14:46.374
We cannot stand by
and let our citizens be slaughtered.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.760
Those are not the values
that Camelot was built on.

14:49.931 --> 14:51.887
Whatever the outcome of this battle.

14:52.058 --> 14:55.721
My sister cannot and will not
desecrate those values.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.185
The war has begun.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.469
Your blade, mordred.

15:34.016 --> 15:37.929
Forged in a dragon's breath,
nothing can survive its touch.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.935
A weapon worthy
of my proudest warrior.

15:50.283 --> 15:55.118
Then I shall wield it in victory
and with honor.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.622
To reach Camelot,
morgana will have no choice...

16:00.793 --> 16:04.160
But to cross the white mountains.
Now, the only pass...

16:04.338 --> 16:07.796
That gives passage
to an army that size is here.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.878
I know it well

16:10.052 --> 16:12.543
the path is bounded
by cliffs on either side.

16:12.722 --> 16:16.306
Arthur: That's where we will meet them.
Now, we may be outnumbered...

16:16.476 --> 16:18.916
But if we don't let them outflank us,
we can hold the pass.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.470
How long? Morgana has no care
for the lives of her men.

16:22.648 --> 16:26.357
She can't supply for an army that size
indefinitely, not isolated by the mountains.

16:26.527 --> 16:30.270
If we can hold out long enough,
she'll be forced to retreat

16:31.324 --> 16:33.440
percival, at what point is
the pass at its narrowest?

16:36.078 --> 16:37.989
Percival: Here, sire.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.995
What do they call this place?

16:40.166 --> 16:41.531
Camlann, sire.

16:44.045 --> 16:47.788
Then it is at camlann
that we make our stand.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.419
Merlin: I hoped never
to hear that name again.

16:54.597 --> 16:58.510
He cannot go, Merlin.
You will have to persuade him.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.265
I know Arthur better
than I know myself.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.552
- He'll not listen.
- If Arthur goes to camlann...

17:02.730 --> 17:06.097
The prophecy will come true
and he will die.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.635
This battle is the only way he knows
how to save his people.

17:08.778 --> 17:11.941
If he's going to lose his life,
he'll still go.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.689
Then what are we to do?

17:17.161 --> 17:20.153
If I can't prevent him from going,
then I must protect him as best I can.

17:20.330 --> 17:22.446
But you can't protect him
without your magic.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.536
Then I must regain my magic.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.294
I can't restore it.
It is beyond my power.

17:30.424 --> 17:34.383
I know. Perhaps it's beyond
anyone's power.

17:34.554 --> 17:38.638
No. If there's an answer,
I must seek it elsewhere.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.673
But where?

17:41.894 --> 17:44.431
The birthplace of magic itself.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.895
The crystal cave.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.558
But the valley of the fallen kings
is crawling with bandits.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.772
Without your powers,
you wouldn't stand a chance.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.276
Which is why I won't be going alone.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.117
I thought you weren't going
till sundown?

18:00.288 --> 18:03.075
There's something I have to do first.
A favor for my friend, Merlin.

18:05.418 --> 18:09.878
- Where are you going?
- The valley of the fallen kings.

18:10.047 --> 18:13.539
- Why?
- Don't worry. I won't be long.

18:20.057 --> 18:23.094
Merlin: I think you'll find
that's everything, sire.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.055
Impressive. Very impressive.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.720
I've never seen work like it.
Well, not from you, anyway.

18:27.898 --> 18:31.015
Heh-heh. Thank you, sire.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.979
So, what are you after?

18:33.154 --> 18:35.110
- After?
- Come on, Merlin.

18:35.281 --> 18:38.523
You're the worst servant in the history
of the world. Now suddenly this.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.067
Is it money? No.

18:41.245 --> 18:44.328
No, it can't be that. You've already
woh all of mine. Time off?

18:45.750 --> 18:47.536
- Arthur.
- No, it can't be that either.

18:47.710 --> 18:50.668
You don't really do anything.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.878
I just wanted to make sure
you had all you needed...

18:53.007 --> 18:56.249
For your journey to camlann,
for the days ahead.

18:56.427 --> 18:58.964
Thank you.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.719
Merlin, what do you mean,
my journey?

19:04.226 --> 19:05.887
I'm afraid I won't be coming with you.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.721
Not this time.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.644
I'm sorry.

19:13.778 --> 19:16.190
I have an urgent errand
to run for Gaius.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.525
Vital supplies
that I can't obtain here.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.861
Vital supplies? Yes

19:23.621 --> 19:25.953
- it's not that I'm...
- No, no.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.455
It's fine.

19:34.048 --> 19:35.788
It's fine I understand.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.006
- Arthur...
- You know, Merlin...

19:38.177 --> 19:41.089
All those jokes
about you being a coward...

19:43.808 --> 19:45.514
I never really meant any of them.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.308
I always thought you were
the bravest man I ever met

20:00.408 --> 20:02.319
Guess I was wrong.

20:28.477 --> 20:29.933
Gwen: Arthur!

20:31.439 --> 20:33.805
Arthur:
Guinevere. What are you doing?

20:33.983 --> 20:36.190
I'm coming with you.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.188
The battlefield is no place for a queen.

20:39.363 --> 20:42.025
I have no intention of joining you there,
I can assure you.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.406
Arthur, if these
are to be your last days...

20:44.577 --> 20:46.317
I would far rather
spend them together...

20:46.495 --> 20:49.487
Than sit waiting for a man
I might never see again.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.611
Morgana: Gently, mordred.

21:26.786 --> 21:30.119
Can't speak with her throat
cut out now, can she?

21:35.377 --> 21:39.165
Well, eira. I trust sir Gwaine
has found your company...

21:39.340 --> 21:41.547
- To his satisfaction.
- I like to think so.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.445
Has he been forthcoming
about Arthur's plans?

21:43.469 --> 21:46.176
He's kept no secrets from me.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.929
Well? Does the king intend
to ride out and meet us?

21:49.099 --> 21:50.509
He does, my lady.

21:50.684 --> 21:53.551
The king and his men depart
from Camelot as we speak.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.471
Then it is as we anticipated.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.482
Thank you, eira.
You've been most informative.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.858
Something else.

22:05.032 --> 22:07.523
The knight said he was
taking Merlin somewhere.

22:07.701 --> 22:10.784
The valley of the fallen kings,
I think.

22:14.792 --> 22:16.657
Merlin?

22:16.836 --> 22:18.872
Why would Merlin leave Arthur now?

22:19.046 --> 22:20.752
Why shouldn't he?

22:20.923 --> 22:23.835
He's of no further use to his king,
after all

22:24.009 --> 22:25.920
perhaps.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.711
But why the valley of the fallen kings?

22:33.519 --> 22:35.760
What is it, mordred?

22:35.938 --> 22:39.726
When I was a boy, the druids told me
of this special place.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.562
A place where magic itself was born.

22:42.736 --> 22:44.943
It was said to lie within the valley.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.945
They called it the crystal cave.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.575
This can mean only one thing.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.987
Emrys means to get his powers back.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.414
Gwaine: Thanks for everything
that you did for eira.

23:01.589 --> 23:03.829
Merlin: No need to thank me.
It was the least I could do.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.082
You seem to care for her.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.672
I could hardly leave her
to the saxons now, could 1?

23:08.846 --> 23:12.179
So that was your only reason
for rescuing her? “Of course.

23:17.271 --> 23:18.386
Gwaine: Aah! - Gwaine!

23:28.282 --> 23:29.282
You okay?

23:31.994 --> 23:34.155
Yeah. I think so. Thank you.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.161
No need to thank me, Merlin.

23:36.332 --> 23:37.538
It was the least I could do.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.018
I can make my own way from here.

24:00.731 --> 24:02.221
Sorry?

24:03.484 --> 24:06.601
You needn't come any further. I'll be fine.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.818
Gwaine:
How will you get back to Camelot?

24:08.989 --> 24:10.854
There are bandits everywhere.

24:11.033 --> 24:15.151
Once I have what I'm looking for,
I'll be perfectly safe, I promise you.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.210
I can't tell you that, Gwaine.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.458
You'll just have to trust me.

24:30.427 --> 24:33.385
You should get going.
Arthur will need you by his side.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.137
Look after yourself, Merlin.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.852
You know to use the sharp end, right?

24:43.023 --> 24:44.263
Heh. Oh, yeah.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.695
I hope you find what you're looking for.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.509
Morgana: Emrys.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.812
Over here, emrys.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.439
I see you, morgana.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.858
How well you've kept your secret.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.948
How well you've protected my brother.

25:40.122 --> 25:42.113
- Face me, morgana!
- Who'd have thought it?

25:42.291 --> 25:45.533
A worthless servant with all that power.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.576
Face me.

25:47.796 --> 25:52.005
But you cannot help your king now.
You cannot even help yourself.

25:52.176 --> 25:54.007
Why do you hide?

25:54.762 --> 25:56.798
You still afraid of me?

25:57.347 --> 26:01.010
I fear no one, least of all you.

26:10.861 --> 26:15.150
You have defied me
for the last time, emrys.

26:34.635 --> 26:36.091
Leon: Send word to the king.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.502
The enemy will reach camlann
by sundown tomorrow...

26:38.680 --> 26:41.467
And we underestimated their force.

26:42.893 --> 26:45.134
They outnumber us five to one.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.710
Arthur: Vital supplies.

28:02.264 --> 28:03.264
Excuse me, sire?

28:04.474 --> 28:07.307
A shame Merlin didn't feel able to join us.

28:09.479 --> 28:12.186
I'm sorry, sire, for I
must take the blame...

28:12.357 --> 28:16.600
But I cannot treat the wounded
without sufficient medicine.

28:16.778 --> 28:20.270
The timing is unfortunate, I Grant you.
Yes

28:21.533 --> 28:23.364
unfortunate, as you say.

28:25.162 --> 28:27.824
I'm not sure he believes you, Gaius.

28:27.998 --> 28:29.989
I'm not sure I do, either.

28:30.792 --> 28:34.580
I know how devoted Merlin is to Arthur. He
would never leave him at a time like this...

28:34.755 --> 28:37.041
Not for a mere errand.

28:37.424 --> 28:39.665
Not unless there was something else...

28:39.843 --> 28:42.550
Something he doesn't feel
able to talk about.

28:47.184 --> 28:49.800
My lady, there is something else...

28:49.978 --> 28:52.720
Something of the very
greatest importance.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.184
And I dearly wish I could
tell you what it is...

28:55.359 --> 28:59.568
But I cannot, for reasons
that affect us all.

29:02.366 --> 29:04.903
Then there is nothing more to be said...

29:05.077 --> 29:08.786
Except for whatever
it is, I wish him luck.

30:02.009 --> 30:03.749
Arthur: This is it.

30:05.595 --> 30:07.256
Camlann.

30:09.766 --> 30:12.508
The fate of the kingdom
will be decided here.

30:13.603 --> 30:16.891
Make camp, take up positions.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.430
It is a death trap, sire.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.433
That's the idea.

30:20.610 --> 30:23.397
Leon:
Morgana will have no means of escape...

30:23.864 --> 30:27.527
And neither will we.
Arthur: They would always outflank us.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.407
This is our only chance.

30:36.043 --> 30:37.954
It ends here, Leon.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.706
Be it life or death

30:43.091 --> 30:44.501
it ends here.

30:59.733 --> 31:01.598
Balinor: Merlin.

31:06.948 --> 31:08.438
Father?

31:13.955 --> 31:14.955
My son.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.997
Are you here?

31:19.211 --> 31:20.667
Are you real?

31:20.837 --> 31:22.748
Dead or alive.

31:22.923 --> 31:24.914
Real or imagined...

31:25.092 --> 31:27.458
Past or present...

31:27.636 --> 31:30.343
These things are of no consequence.

31:31.014 --> 31:33.801
All that matters is that
you heed the words...

31:33.975 --> 31:36.512
Of your father, who loves you.

31:36.686 --> 31:39.143
Do not let go, Merlin.

31:39.481 --> 31:41.392
Do not give in.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.979
I have no reason to go on.

31:46.655 --> 31:48.987
The battle is already over.

31:49.157 --> 31:50.192
Morgana has won.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.779
Only if you accept defeat.

31:52.953 --> 31:54.784
But if you fight...

31:54.955 --> 31:57.116
If you let hope into your heart...

31:57.290 --> 31:58.871
Morgana cannot be victorious.

31:59.835 --> 32:02.622
What hope is there without my magic?

32:06.591 --> 32:11.676
Merlin, you are more
than a son of your father.

32:12.681 --> 32:17.516
You are son of the earth, the sea, the sky.

32:18.311 --> 32:21.974
Magic is the fabric of this world...

32:22.774 --> 32:25.311
And you were born of that magic.

32:27.028 --> 32:30.111
You are magic itself.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.232
You cannot lose what you are.

32:34.202 --> 32:37.820
But how do I find myself again?

32:37.998 --> 32:39.954
Believe, Merlin.

32:41.084 --> 32:44.747
Believe what your heart knows to be true.

32:45.547 --> 32:48.129
That you have always been...

32:48.717 --> 32:50.503
And always will be.

32:53.346 --> 32:56.304
Always will be...

32:57.517 --> 32:59.223
Rest now.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.636
Rest, my son.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.597
And soon...

33:06.318 --> 33:08.525
You shall awaken into the light.

33:42.479 --> 33:44.015
What is it?

33:48.193 --> 33:50.525
What if sir Leon was right?

33:51.196 --> 33:53.653
Perhaps we should have
made our stand at Camelot.

33:55.158 --> 33:57.194
Your plan is brave...

33:57.369 --> 33:58.734
And bold.

33:59.246 --> 34:02.534
And our only chance to defeat morgana
once and for all

34:02.707 --> 34:04.447
yes, we could have
held out in the citadel.

34:04.626 --> 34:07.618
But for how long?
And at what cost to the kingdom?

34:08.255 --> 34:13.045
I have never for a moment doubted
the valor and wisdom of this choice.

34:19.808 --> 34:23.596
If you do not doubt me, Guinevere
then I do not doubt myself.

34:24.603 --> 34:27.562
And that gives me a strength
greater than any weapon.

34:35.699 --> 34:39.862
Come. We must rest while we can.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.875
Morgana:
Have the outriders returned?

34:58.263 --> 35:00.629
Arthur has made camp at camlann.

35:00.807 --> 35:04.220
And the path”? Did you find it?

35:04.394 --> 35:06.806
It was well concealed.

35:07.063 --> 35:11.648
If Arthur imagines we can't outflank him,
he's in for an unpleasant surprise.

35:13.236 --> 35:15.693
Send 100 warriors.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.945
Good ones.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.650
Mordred:
I'll choose them myself.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.035
And prepare the army.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.116
We attack tonight.

37:11.312 --> 37:14.270
Arthur, where are you? Arthur.

37:16.401 --> 37:20.019
Arthur, I'm sorry I had to leave you.
I didn't want to.

37:20.697 --> 37:23.279
I hope one day you'll understand why.

37:23.867 --> 37:27.985
Your plan is a good one and you may yet
save this kingdom, but you must beware.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.245
Your army's flank is vulnerable.

37:30.415 --> 37:32.371
There's an old path over the Ridge
at camlann.

37:32.542 --> 37:34.624
Morgana knows of it.
She means to trap you, Arthur.

37:34.794 --> 37:39.413
Find the path or the battle will be over
before it's begun. Find the path.

37:48.391 --> 37:50.222
What's the matter?

37:50.810 --> 37:52.220
Merlin

37:53.480 --> 37:57.189
- it was a dream, Arthur. Just a dream.
- It didn't feel like a dream.

37:58.985 --> 38:00.600
It felt

38:04.032 --> 38:05.772
Arthur.

38:08.578 --> 38:11.741
Sire. The scouts report
that morgana's army is on the move.

38:11.915 --> 38:14.351
She'll attack before the night's done.
Tell the men to prepare.

38:14.375 --> 38:17.367
Leon: Yes, sire.
- Percival, Gwaine!

38:18.463 --> 38:20.795
Take a patrol of men to the rear of us.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.325
You're looking for a hidden path
running into the mountains.

38:23.468 --> 38:26.676
She means to outflank us.
We must stop her now.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.660
Tonight...

38:56.543 --> 38:58.408
We do battle.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.371
Tonight, we end this war.

39:04.133 --> 39:06.875
We end a war as old as the land itself.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.088
A war against tyranny...

39:12.141 --> 39:13.802
And greed...

39:14.811 --> 39:15.971
And spite.

39:18.398 --> 39:21.515
Not all will greet the dawn.
Some will live.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.649
Some will die.

39:24.487 --> 39:28.196
But each and every one of you
fights with honor...

39:29.284 --> 39:31.149
And with pride.

39:32.954 --> 39:36.617
For not only do we fight for our lives...

39:38.751 --> 39:40.958
We fight for the future.

39:43.256 --> 39:45.622
The future of Camelot.

39:46.509 --> 39:48.625
The future of albion.

39:49.137 --> 39:52.129
The future of the united kingdoms.

39:55.977 --> 39:57.638
For the love of Camelot!

39:57.812 --> 40:00.554
All: For the love of Camelot!

40:14.537 --> 40:18.325
Thank you for your help, your guidance.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.865
I only offered a hand.

40:21.628 --> 40:25.041
You stand tall on your own two feet,
Merlin. You always have done.

40:26.507 --> 40:28.293
As did you, father.

40:30.637 --> 40:32.298
I follow in your footsteps.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.764
Your journey has only just begun.

40:36.684 --> 40:40.097
You wield a power
you cannot yet conceive of.

40:40.271 --> 40:45.140
Only in the heart of the crystal cave
will your true self be revealed.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.361
Move towards the light.

40:54.869 --> 40:57.201
Your destiny awaits.

41:02.168 --> 41:04.750
Do not be afraid.

41:05.088 --> 41:07.545
Trust in what you are.

41:08.007 --> 41:11.340
Trust in what will be.

41:29.195 --> 41:33.029
- Goodbye, father.
- There are no goodbyes, emrys...

41:34.033 --> 41:37.821
For I will always be...

41:38.454 --> 41:42.288
As you will always be.

42:20.288 --> 42:21.653
Arthur: On me!

42:34.635 --> 42:36.250
On me!

44:06.269 --> 44:08.510
Merlin: I am a sorcerer

44:08.896 --> 44:10.887
I have magic.
