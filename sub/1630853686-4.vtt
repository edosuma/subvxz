WEBVTT

00:57.640 --> 00:58.933
I'm still here.

01:00.060 --> 01:00.894
Yes!

01:05.690 --> 01:08.860
Being dead is no excuse
to bail on mochaccinos with me

01:08.943 --> 01:10.737
for smoochaccinos with Jake C.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.864
I need to figure out what
my unfinished business is.

01:12.947 --> 01:14.783
It's obviously not making out with Jake C.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.284
It could be making out with Jake C.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.869
With our shirts off.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.747
Or our pants off.

01:20.830 --> 01:23.416
Or both. I don't know.
I'm gonna try it all just to be safe.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.795
I'm dead. So, until I figure out
my unfinished business,

01:26.878 --> 01:29.297
I'm gonna get down to business.
And I don't know.

01:30.423 --> 01:33.259
Sit on Jake C's face?
I dunno how that's sanitary

01:33.343 --> 01:34.719
or comfortable or safe,

01:34.803 --> 01:36.471
but I'll figure it out.

01:36.554 --> 01:37.430
What…

01:37.972 --> 01:39.516
What exactly is the seat?

01:40.100 --> 01:43.645
I can't believe
I'm talking like this. I… I feel so alive.

01:43.728 --> 01:46.856
-I must be living.
-Yeah, you are. Until you're a lava lamp.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.943
-Dude.
-It's not me. I have earbuds in.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.153
-Public school low-rent jank.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.031
It's Jake C.

01:57.325 --> 01:58.284
Shocked.

02:01.162 --> 02:03.706
I can't stay in here. It smells so bad.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.667
Did Stinky just pass by?

02:06.417 --> 02:07.585
His name is Devon.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.130
-Why does it smell so bad in here?

02:10.213 --> 02:11.673
Because one of you

02:11.756 --> 02:14.926
forgot to put this guy back in the fridge.

02:15.468 --> 02:17.554
This is what happens
when you leave a dead carcass

02:17.637 --> 02:19.264
out in the heat to decompose.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.728
You are gonna
decompose pretty quickly,

02:25.812 --> 02:27.230
and if we can already…

02:29.023 --> 02:30.150
If we can already smell it,

02:30.233 --> 02:32.777
then it's only a matter of time
before somebody else does.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.281
You are gonna be a smelly virgin
stinking up a lava lamp for eternity.

02:36.364 --> 02:38.116
Maybe my unfinished business is sex.

02:38.199 --> 02:41.077
It seems like virgins have an easier
track to heaven, if there is a heaven.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.580
-Joan of Arc, Virgin Mary.
-They weren't really virgins.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.915
The church wasn't sex-positive then
like it is now.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.584
-What?
-Okay, it's probably not sex.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.253
Is there anything
you were working on that day?

02:50.336 --> 02:52.630
What was the thing we were
talking about before you died?

02:52.714 --> 02:55.300
Since we're saying yes to everything,

02:55.383 --> 02:56.843
how about prom?

02:56.926 --> 02:59.721
I mean, I'm already going with Jake W.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.640
He said yes, and you should too.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.559
Yes! I'm gonna ask Jake C.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.728
-Ah! We're going to prom!
-We are!

03:07.395 --> 03:08.229
Prom!

03:08.313 --> 03:09.647
My unfinished business is prom.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.775
Duh. Of course it's prom. It's the most
important high school rite of passage.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.986
IANGDTTOLO.

03:17.113 --> 03:19.574
-I have to go to prom with Jake C!
-But that's two weeks away.

03:19.657 --> 03:22.160
How the heck are we gonna
keep your body intact for two weeks?

03:22.243 --> 03:25.496
Maybe you can try and use
your ghost powers and cold blast it.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.333
Mmm… My ghost powers are pretty lame,
but I can try.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.884
Oh, it's happening. You're doing it.

03:37.967 --> 03:41.471
But it's only a little bit of ice,
and I nearly shit myself trying.

03:41.554 --> 03:44.015
-Okay, maybe we should just buy ice.
-Let's go to the store.

03:44.098 --> 03:46.809
-Aren't you going to lunch with Jake C?
-Yeah.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.729
I was so distracted being distracted.
Thank you for being my North Star.

03:49.812 --> 03:50.688
Ice after school.

03:52.106 --> 03:53.191
-Hey.
-Hey.

03:53.274 --> 03:54.359
Sorry, I'm late.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.653
-Yeah, you missed taco day.
-Oh my God.

03:56.736 --> 03:57.654
They're all sold out.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.405
But, I mean, I guess it's a good thing

03:59.489 --> 04:01.616
that I got you an extra plate.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.701
Thank you.

04:05.119 --> 04:09.207
Um… So I'm not actually
gonna be out of town for prom.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.500
-Oh my God, that's great.
-Yeah.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.628
What should we do instead?
Do you wanna do dinner? See a movie?

04:13.711 --> 04:16.089
Do you wanna see a movie about dinner?

04:16.172 --> 04:17.257
-What?

04:17.340 --> 04:20.635
Um, or… or we could go to…

04:20.718 --> 04:22.637
-Know what'd be so funny? Wait.
-Uh.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.431
We could go to prom ironically.

04:25.515 --> 04:26.891
-Yeah.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.810
God, no. Oh my gosh.

04:28.893 --> 04:32.563
You were so right about prom.
Seriously. It is such a cliché.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.565
That's what's so cool about you.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.276
You DGAF about prom.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.696
'Cause, I mean, prom is so lame.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.783
Yeah… Yeah, totally. Mm.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.535
Prom is so lame.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.005
Chill. I've seen them.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.507
He's moved on. I've moved on.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.927
-What have you moved on to?
-There are so many options.

05:03.845 --> 05:04.929
Not you.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.475
Jake C and I are good.
We're gonna be friends.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.728
And what about how this
affects the rest of us?

05:11.811 --> 05:15.189
This is between Jake C and me.
Why would it affect anyone else?

05:16.774 --> 05:17.608
Yeah.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.744
We can't sit with Riley.
We gotta support our boy.

05:27.827 --> 05:30.872
Dude. Lea will be so pissed
if I sit with Jake C.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.207
But then where do we sit?

05:34.208 --> 05:35.460
We stand.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.253
We stand tall.

05:39.213 --> 05:41.007
What am I supposed to do now?

05:41.090 --> 05:43.551
I can't ask him to prom
until I un-ask him to not prom.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.429
We gotta figure it out
before Riley worms her way back in.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.848
Worms, body, ice. Let's get the ice.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.267
Shit. It's Jake.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.227
-What did he text you?
-It's Jake W.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.482
Double shit.

05:57.565 --> 06:00.902
-Did I miss something?
-I haven't talked to him since the party.

06:01.569 --> 06:02.862
Did he ghost you?

06:02.945 --> 06:04.614
What a dick.

06:04.697 --> 06:07.283
Uh, actually, he texted me.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.619
-I forgot to text him back.
-Dude.

06:09.702 --> 06:13.081
Look, you know, I've been
a little bit preoccupied, you know?

06:13.164 --> 06:16.417
Dead best friend, existence of ghosts,
my generalized anxiety disorder.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.587
If my unfinished business is to go
to prom, then you have to go with me.

06:19.670 --> 06:20.630
And he is your date.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.715
Well, he was two weeks ago,
but now who knows?

06:23.591 --> 06:25.968
You can't go alone.
Worse than not going is going alone.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.346
Besides, prom is your thing.

06:28.429 --> 06:30.431
Well, no. It's actually now your thing.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.558
Fine. It's our thing.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.478
And you have to go 'cause I'm going,
and we're going together.

06:35.561 --> 06:39.148
We're going to prom.
Yes!

06:40.108 --> 06:42.944
Now lock in the date and talk to Jake W.

06:43.027 --> 06:44.404
Ooh. No way. Nope.

06:44.487 --> 06:48.157
Face-to-face after taking
this long a hiatus would be aggro AF.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.869
-I will text him.
-Fine. I'll get the ice, you text.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.588
That's a lot of ice.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.966
Yeah. I think I cleared you out.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.634
You having a party?

07:08.094 --> 07:10.555
Yep, huge party tonight.

07:11.055 --> 07:13.307
Probably gonna get shut down by the cops.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.693
Hauling a shit-ton of ice out to the car
was fun. How's the texting?

07:23.776 --> 07:27.572
Good. We've leveled up to Bitmojis,
and he's excited to hang out tonight.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.615
Wow, making moves! You getting together?

07:29.699 --> 07:31.576
Yeah, at our party.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.953
Why did you tell him we're having a party?

07:34.036 --> 07:37.498
He must have heard my cover story
for the ice. Just tell him it's canceled.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.836
Can't. He just put it
in the senior text chain.

07:41.919 --> 07:44.589
-Shit.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.844
Okay, I've changed my mind.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.597
I think a party could be a great way
for us to make a mark.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.600
Totally. We'll do it at your house,
and keep it low-key.

07:55.683 --> 07:59.061
No, this party is a part of your legacy.
Our legacy.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.355
We need everyone
to be talking about it tomorrow,

08:01.439 --> 08:03.107
the day after, and for years to come.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.026
To remember it. To remember us.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.863
Don't you wanna be remembered?
'Cause I do.

08:09.363 --> 08:11.949
You're right. And this is how
I'm gonna get Jake C to go to prom.

08:12.033 --> 08:15.244
Yes! He will see that you
don't just follow trends.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.162
-No.
-You set them.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.706
-'Cause what kind of wild party goddess…
-Mm-hm. Whoo!

08:18.789 --> 08:20.708
-Me.
-…throws bangers on a Monday?

08:20.791 --> 08:23.085
-Erika Vu. That's… She does.
-Right here. Mm-hm.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.545
So what do we need for the party?

08:24.629 --> 08:26.422
-A theme. Disco?
-Luau?

08:26.506 --> 08:27.965
-Early T Swift?
-Late T Swift?

08:28.049 --> 08:31.010
<i>-Dungeons and Drag Queens?</i>
-Jellicle cats, things you can milk?

08:31.093 --> 08:32.553
-What?
-Huh. Sorry. Uh…

08:32.637 --> 08:35.848
With the ice bags and the ghost chill,
my brain is totally frozen.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.183
I cannot think straight.

08:37.266 --> 08:40.561
Do you feel my cold right now? I'm sorry.
I don't know how to turn it off.

08:42.396 --> 08:43.940
Winter wonderland!

08:44.023 --> 08:45.775
-Okay. We're gonna need snow.
-Cocaine?

08:45.858 --> 08:48.819
No. Well, maybe, but snow.

08:49.403 --> 08:50.863
How are we gonna get snow?

08:53.074 --> 08:54.283
Seems like an emergency to me.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.167
-Epic.
-Yeah.

09:04.168 --> 09:06.504
Okay. Aren't these tables
a little too close together?

09:06.587 --> 09:09.006
-No. It forces people to interact more.
-Good thinking.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.133
This party is gonna be so lit.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.301
I know.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.388
Unless nobody comes.
People will show up for this party, right?

09:15.471 --> 09:18.307
Oh my God. What if no one comes,
and we're that sad party no one goes to?

09:18.391 --> 09:19.559
That would be so embarrassing.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.394
Or if three people show up.

09:21.477 --> 09:23.563
That would be so much worse.
We'd have witnesses.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.481
-This could ruin us.
-We'd be infamous.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.983
We have to advertise.

09:27.483 --> 09:30.027
Tonight at nine, come for a cool time.

09:32.446 --> 09:33.823
<i>We'll have cocktails.</i>

09:35.616 --> 09:36.826
<i>And mocktails.</i>

09:37.910 --> 09:40.538
<i>-And music to jam to.</i>
-Don't touch my phone.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.248
<i>-Decorations to gram to.</i>

09:42.331 --> 09:45.084
<i>Make sure to dress warm,</i>
<i>or you're gonna be left out in the cold.</i>

09:45.167 --> 09:46.711
Let's find your snowsuit.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.298
<i>This party is for everybody.</i>
<i>All-inclusive.</i>

09:50.381 --> 09:52.466
<i>See you there, and don't flake out.</i>

10:00.600 --> 10:02.101
-What's up?
-Nothing much.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.604
Just thought I'd call.
See how you're doing.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.064
-Yeah, I'm going to Erika's party.
-Cool.

10:07.148 --> 10:10.484
-Have you talked to Riley recently?
-What's she doing now?

10:10.568 --> 10:12.445
Nothing. She's being totally cool.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.488
Which is the problem. It's scary.

10:14.572 --> 10:18.618
Lea wants to go to Erika's party tonight,
but she's afraid to ask Riley.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.162
So she asked me if I could ask you

10:21.245 --> 10:25.249
if you could ask Riley
if it'd be okay for us to all go.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.960
-You guys are kidding me with this, right?
-No, we need to know.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.463
Look. I'm not, um, calling Riley,

10:30.546 --> 10:32.465
but, you know what,
I do give you all permission

10:32.548 --> 10:34.842
to do whatever you wanna do
from here on out.

10:34.925 --> 10:38.679
Because I don't care what Riley thinks,
and neither should you.

10:38.763 --> 10:42.558
And we also don't need
a five-way call to discuss this.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.102
Guys, let's jump on another call
to debrief.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.854
-Yeah.

10:47.438 --> 10:48.356
Oh my God.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.066
<i>It's party time!</i>

10:59.617 --> 11:02.286
Yes! Every group is repped tonight.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.538
And it's a full-blown rager.

11:05.122 --> 11:08.959
There he is. I'm gonna ask him to prom
so I don't spend eternity in a lava lamp.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.171
Here I go. Wish me luck.

11:12.254 --> 11:13.631
You don't need it.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.759
Erika! Hey!

11:16.842 --> 11:20.763
We missed you at our last meeting.
Don't feel bad about eating Jesus's face.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.516
He forgives you,
and you're welcome back at any time.

11:24.100 --> 11:24.934
Amazing.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.770
We left a DD sign-up sheet
over by the door,

11:27.853 --> 11:29.480
but Josh lost our Sharpie.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.066
-Oh. Well, Sharpies are in the basket--
-In the kitchen.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.822
-That's not where they are.
-Well, I don't really care.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.448
'Cause it's my turn to bother you.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.458
Aah.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.855
-Oh, this is perfect. I'm freezing.
-Me too.

12:11.522 --> 12:12.982
Put on the fur.

12:13.065 --> 12:15.109
I need this
in my closet yester-now.

12:15.192 --> 12:18.863
No. Hey. Don't touch my mom's coats, okay?
Those are heirlooms. Hey!

12:19.864 --> 12:21.782
I… I am gonna head you off.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.841
You… are twin flames.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.968
Your union is a soul connection

12:41.051 --> 12:43.345
and will lead you
to the next level of consciousness…

12:43.429 --> 12:45.556
-Psst. Erika.
-I'll be right back.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.475
Oh.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.643
-Did you ask him yet?
-I'm working up to it.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.980
-You need to do it now. Riley is here.
-Who cares? Jake C and I are twin flames.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.648
Do not underestimate her, okay?

12:54.732 --> 12:57.067
-If she's at your party, then she is--
-Okay, <i>our</i> party.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.737
Right. Okay. Yeah, sure. It's our party.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.281
But if she's here
then she's definitely up to something.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.035
Hey.

13:09.538 --> 13:12.500
-Okay, that didn't seem normal.
-Not at all.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.001
I gotta get back in the game.

13:17.588 --> 13:21.801
Damn it. Those bitches are doing
snow angels in my mom's coats.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.260
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.012
-I missed you.
-I missed you.

13:25.095 --> 13:27.473
You know, we are a great event couple,
aren't we?

13:28.557 --> 13:29.725
What do you mean?

13:29.809 --> 13:30.935
Like this. Like this event.

13:31.018 --> 13:33.521
We're good at it. Think about
the events we're gonna be great at,

13:33.604 --> 13:36.482
like pool parties, and daygers, and

13:37.316 --> 13:38.275
dances.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.652
Casual.

13:39.735 --> 13:40.778
Formal.

13:40.861 --> 13:41.821
Ritual.

13:42.321 --> 13:46.033
Yeah. I mean, we're great at events.
And non-events, you know?

13:47.243 --> 13:49.662
I cannot wait to not go to prom with you.

13:51.205 --> 13:54.291
Mm-hm. Yeah, me too.
I can't wait to not go.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.001
-It's gonna be great.
-Yeah.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.087
Ooh. Let's do tarot.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.339
Or we could make snowmen.

14:00.422 --> 14:01.715
I mean independent snowwomen.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.592
Then warm ourselves up
with the vodka luge.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.886
Or we could take selfies with Edwin.

14:06.554 --> 14:07.596
The polar bear.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.765
Or we could get our cards read.

14:09.849 --> 14:10.683
Or--

14:10.766 --> 14:12.726
I see them. It's fine.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.271
They actually look really cute together.

14:15.771 --> 14:17.273
I'm gonna go look at the snacks.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.279
No, you guys. That's a powder room.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.864
Okay? You can't have sex in there.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.949
Let's ride it off the roof!

14:27.032 --> 14:29.493
No, wait. Please.
Let's not, okay? Thank you. Yeah.

14:33.747 --> 14:34.623
Okay.

14:40.087 --> 14:40.921
Erika!

15:12.286 --> 15:14.371
"Erika's epic winter wonderland"?

15:17.958 --> 15:19.835
It's my party too, assholes.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.431
-…so drunk.
-I'm not drunk.

15:32.514 --> 15:34.058
Maybe a little.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.935
-Get out.
-Oh. Sorry.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.187
I didn't know anyone was in here.

15:39.521 --> 15:42.191
And I don't think you're supposed
to be touching those coats.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.193
Someone was yelling about it downstairs.

15:46.987 --> 15:48.906
No, wait. Don't go.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.282
Wanna hang out?

15:50.366 --> 15:51.492
Sure.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.827
-Ahh.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.586
I can't believe how long I've gone
without knowing you.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.089
I know.
I can't believe how much time I wasted.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.508
I wish there were more opportunities
to dance like this.

16:08.175 --> 16:11.387
My cousin's bar mitzvah is next month.
You should totally come.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.597
Or we could dance at prom?

16:15.557 --> 16:17.685
I know I said I didn't want to go,
but I do.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.812
I was just trying to be cool, but I'm not.

16:19.895 --> 16:22.231
I just didn't think
I was gonna get the chance to go.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.691
Let alone with someone like you.

16:25.025 --> 16:26.986
These faux fur coats are so warm.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.612
Mm. They're actually not faux fur.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.533
My mom, she inherited them from an aunt
whose husband was in the mob.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.702
They used to launder their money
with the coats.

16:34.785 --> 16:38.372
Oh. Wow. Gross, unethical, and criminal.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.583
You still make it work.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.004
-Stanley thinks so too.
-Stanley?

16:45.087 --> 16:46.755
Yeah, this dead mink on my back. Yeah.

16:50.634 --> 16:53.303
So you wanna explain why your best friend

16:53.387 --> 16:56.098
is throwing the party of the year,
and you're upstairs in her room?

16:56.181 --> 17:00.436
Well, it's my room. And <i>we're </i>throwing
the best party of the year,

17:00.519 --> 17:03.188
which no one seems to know,
even though it's at my house,

17:03.272 --> 17:05.774
because no one seems to know me.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.485
Including my prom date,
who's downstairs making out with his ex.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.947
Which is, like, mildly understandable
'cause he's a total babe.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.615
So make out with your own babe.

17:16.910 --> 17:17.870
Or me.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.508
-Sorry. That was Stanley's idea.
-Yeah.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.761
Stanley, you are one dirty mink.

17:34.470 --> 17:35.345
Or five.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.605
-Oh shit. Oh my God. Shit.

17:47.858 --> 17:50.986
You know what? Let's pretend
I didn't say anything, and we can rewind.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.321
What if I told you

17:52.404 --> 17:55.657
that I really wanted
to go to prom with you too?

17:57.409 --> 17:59.495
-Oh, uh…

17:59.578 --> 18:00.621
Did you hear me?

18:00.704 --> 18:02.289
I thought you weren't into prom.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.001
I was just, uh, trying to be cool,

18:06.085 --> 18:09.463
because I thought the girl I liked
was too cool for prom.

18:09.546 --> 18:10.380
-Mm-mm.
-But, uh…

18:10.464 --> 18:12.883
Turns out neither of us
are really too cool.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.930
So… do you wanna

18:18.013 --> 18:19.932
not not go to prom with me?

18:20.015 --> 18:22.434
I would love to not not go
to prom with you.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.852
Wait, uh…

18:23.936 --> 18:28.023
Um, uh, just to clarify that.
That means we're going to prom, right?

18:28.107 --> 18:30.609
Yep, yes. You are my prom date.
I am your prom date.

18:31.401 --> 18:32.820
Together, we are prom dates.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.245
I heard it. They're going to prom.

18:42.913 --> 18:45.624
You guys have got to stop. I'm cool.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.671
Get off. He wants me to freak out.

18:50.754 --> 18:54.424
Then Erika seems cool,
I sound like a crazy person, and she wins.

18:54.508 --> 18:55.717
She's not a winner.

18:56.343 --> 18:58.303
I am. Get it?

18:58.387 --> 19:00.305
So,

19:00.389 --> 19:02.266
you're actually not cool?

19:03.016 --> 19:06.019
-No. Wrong. I'm so cool.
-Right.

19:07.187 --> 19:08.397
But you're not.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.858
I'm gonna go get a drink.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.943
Have you tried Erika's Ambassador yet?

19:13.443 --> 19:14.486
It's good.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.448
-Guess she's cool.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.459
Gavin, did you pass out?

19:30.419 --> 19:31.420
Hello?

19:48.937 --> 19:51.273
So you wanna hear something crazy?

19:51.356 --> 19:52.691
Yes, please.

19:52.774 --> 19:56.153
I'm actually, like, really excited
to go to prom.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.780
Me too. Okay, okay.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.575
So first, we are going to rent a limo,

20:01.658 --> 20:05.662
and we are gonna take
all the awful, cliché prom photos.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.165
I've got the perfect awkward photo smile.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.291
Seriously. It's like…

20:09.791 --> 20:11.919
-Yeah, it's like that.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.965
And we are 100% gonna wear
matching color-coordinated outfits.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.634
Oh, let me guess. Neon yellow.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.637
-No, no, no, no. All camo.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.222
-That's the one.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.974
No, blue.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.393
And not just any blue. Midnight blue.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.568
Midnight blue is my color, bitch!

20:39.321 --> 20:41.573
Helen Who is ruining my life.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.076
First, you almost ruined my nose.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.702
Then you ruin my prom.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.956
And now you steal my color,
because you're obsessed with me.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.832
You've been obsessed with me
for four years,

20:50.916 --> 20:54.002
and now you've stolen my boyfriend.
We all know what's happening next.

20:54.086 --> 20:57.089
You're gonna dye your hair like mine,
steal my social security number,

20:57.172 --> 20:59.925
and then I end up in seven
tall kitchen trash bags

21:00.008 --> 21:01.301
in your neighbor's recycling bin.

21:02.052 --> 21:05.055
I'm scared.
For the record, everybody, I'm scared.

21:05.138 --> 21:06.932
-Okay, I'm not--
-I got this.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.149
Riley, I'm sorry
that you're hurting. Okay?

21:16.233 --> 21:18.694
Going through a breakup sucks,

21:18.777 --> 21:21.446
but I didn't steal your prom date.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.157
Okay, you guys were broken up,
and he wanted to go with me.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.994
Sorry. Am I speaking for you?
Do you wanna say something?

21:27.077 --> 21:28.078
Nope.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.497
I know you didn't steal him,

21:30.580 --> 21:32.791
because you couldn't steal anybody.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.919
You are so pathetic. You're just--

21:36.003 --> 21:37.045
Done.

21:37.921 --> 21:40.299
I'm done letting you bully me, Riley.
Okay?

21:40.382 --> 21:43.677
We can all wear the same color.
Because who says that you own it?

21:44.303 --> 21:46.680
Okay, who else wants
to wear midnight blue, huh?

21:49.349 --> 21:51.226
Great. Everyone wear it. Who cares?

21:51.310 --> 21:54.271
-I care. And I called it first.
-Yeah, but you're not in charge of us.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.940
And you don't get to dictate what we wear,

21:57.024 --> 21:58.275
what we do,

21:58.358 --> 22:00.068
who we do… I mean, who we are.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.654
-No, she doesn't.
-Shh. She'll frickin' kill you.

22:03.155 --> 22:07.993
I let you take my identity
for the past four years, but no more.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.163
My name is Erika Vu,

22:11.246 --> 22:13.165
and this is my fucking party, bitch.

22:13.248 --> 22:15.083
So, if you don't like it,
there's the door.

22:21.381 --> 22:25.135
Erika! Erika!

22:25.635 --> 22:29.139
Erika! Erika!

22:29.222 --> 22:30.766
-Erika!
-What?

22:30.849 --> 22:32.476
-Erika!
-What?
