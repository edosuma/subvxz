00:01.468 --> 00:03.002
<i>Previously on "Being Mary Jane..."</i>

00:03.436 --> 00:08.208
- You okay with me having kids?
- Yeah, I like kids.

00:08.508 --> 00:12.245
Is that your driver? Did you tip him?
Looks like he's waiting for something.

00:12.645 --> 00:14.814
I should've known Old Spice man
was your type.

00:14.881 --> 00:17.450
First of all,
you wouldn't know what my type is.

00:17.717 --> 00:20.620
And second of all,
we never said we were exclusive.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.155
I'm done trying to figure you out.

00:23.256 --> 00:24.524
It's so lonely.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.062
And I'm so tired.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.230
So stop running.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.932
- Take a risk.
- So you forgive me?

00:32.999 --> 00:34.567
They would never said it out loud.

00:34.634 --> 00:38.738
But the assumption is there can only be
one black woman at the table.

00:38.805 --> 00:42.008
I think there's room for both of us.

00:42.342 --> 00:45.211
- What do you say? Are you with me?
- Yeah, I'm with you.

00:45.278 --> 00:47.881
I built that charity from nothing.

00:49.649 --> 00:51.251
It was my brand.

00:51.618 --> 00:53.052
Now it's poisoned.

00:53.119 --> 00:55.155
This is not how I wanted it to happen.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.689
Kara, she mentored me.

00:56.756 --> 01:00.160
I wasn't gonna let her whole world
blow up without telling her first.

01:00.226 --> 01:04.697
I brought you into my world, Mary Jane.
Me. I got you this damn job!

01:05.064 --> 01:06.299
What are you doing here?

01:06.366 --> 01:08.535
- I'm the new senior producer.
- Producer? Here?

01:08.802 --> 01:10.470
When Ronda Sales calls and invites you

01:10.537 --> 01:12.472
on the biggest morning show
in the country,

01:13.173 --> 01:14.407
you answer.

01:27.487 --> 01:28.888
A private elevator?

01:29.255 --> 01:31.057
A killer view of Manhattan.

01:32.826 --> 01:36.296
- I feel like I'm home already.
- Too bad it's not for sale.

01:36.830 --> 01:40.600
How does my little brother, who used to
twirl signs on a street corner,

01:40.667 --> 01:41.734
afford this?

01:41.801 --> 01:43.970
My old boss in L.A. hooked me up

01:44.037 --> 01:46.906
with one of the best real estate firms
in New York.

01:46.973 --> 01:48.842
And I am killing it right now.

01:48.908 --> 01:50.043
In six months?

01:50.376 --> 01:52.512
Have you even had time
to build up a clientele?

01:52.579 --> 01:55.815
I just tell people my sister
is about to be the next Ronda Sales.

01:55.882 --> 01:57.517
I wouldn't count on that.

01:58.351 --> 02:00.487
What happened?
I thought the deal was all set.

02:00.553 --> 02:02.522
Justin happened, for starters.

02:02.589 --> 02:03.790
Okay, who's Justin?

02:04.390 --> 02:05.859
Long tragic story.

02:05.925 --> 02:07.427
But anyway...

02:07.494 --> 02:09.195
How much does something like this cost?

02:09.562 --> 02:10.964
- Fifteen million.
- What?

02:11.030 --> 02:13.132
Yeah. We're not in ATL anymore, 'Letta.

02:13.199 --> 02:15.101
Four percent of 15 million is...

02:15.168 --> 02:19.272
Six hundred thousand dollars.
My God, did I just say that?

02:19.606 --> 02:21.241
- Yeah. That's...
- I did.

02:21.307 --> 02:23.543
That's a lot of money,
but it doesn't afford this.

02:23.610 --> 02:27.347
It belongs to a client. I'm managing it
while they're out of the country.

02:27.413 --> 02:31.417
Tell me, have there been any naked girls
on that white couch?

02:31.484 --> 02:33.586
It's not like that, 'Letta.
I promise you.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.923
Look. Can we just focus
on what you're looking for?

02:36.990 --> 02:40.426
You have to be out of that hotel
pretty soon.

02:40.994 --> 02:45.265
So what are we talking?
You want a two-bedroom, large kitchen?

02:45.331 --> 02:47.867
- We're talking this. I want this.
- This.

02:48.134 --> 02:49.402
But with a lot less zeros.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.112
I should've listened to you about Ronda.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.848
I swear I wake up thinking about it
every morning.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.183
That's water under the bridge.

03:05.285 --> 03:08.021
We have a much bigger problem now.
Freakin' Boys Club.

03:08.321 --> 03:11.190
Justin had a knack
for sucking up to the higher-ups.

03:11.591 --> 03:13.426
Did the same damn thing in Atlanta.

03:14.661 --> 03:15.762
Jackass.

03:15.828 --> 03:19.032
I hustled my way into this network
so I could be promoted to nightly news.

03:19.098 --> 03:21.200
- And you will.
- Not without big stories.

03:21.267 --> 03:23.937
Still no word about covering
the Supreme Court nominee?

03:24.237 --> 03:27.340
With Justin here, Garrett won't even look
in my damn direction.

03:27.907 --> 03:31.611
I was looking to make history here,
be the first woman to run this show.

03:31.678 --> 03:34.714
But Mr. Smooth Operator wants it
just as bad as I do.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.749
It's 2008, all over again.

03:36.816 --> 03:39.786
I'm Hillary, and the fine-ass black man
is trying to kick my damn ass.

03:40.086 --> 03:42.188
So, we figure out
how to get killer stories.

03:42.255 --> 03:43.389
Where's Natalie?

03:43.957 --> 03:46.659
I don't know. Editing, maybe? Why?

03:46.726 --> 03:49.829
We got an exclusive with New York's
second baseman, Orlando Lagos.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.030
Is Natalie covering it?

03:51.097 --> 03:53.299
No, Aaron is.
So we gotta bump her segment.

03:53.366 --> 03:56.402
This cooking segment
Kara spent all morning working on?

03:56.469 --> 03:59.806
Yes. Look, it's a solid segment.
I'm sure it'll come back around.

04:05.411 --> 04:07.046
It's an app called "Wantagwan."

04:07.113 --> 04:09.582
You can take video,
pictures, add filters,

04:09.649 --> 04:11.584
and your followers can leave comments.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.553
And how is this different from Snapchat?

04:14.087 --> 04:17.924
Way more emojis. Facebook's gonna
eventually buy it for billions.

04:18.224 --> 04:21.394
Being up on the latest apps is sexy.
It's current.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.029
Appeals to the younger demo.

04:23.296 --> 04:24.964
We can use it to promote the show.

04:25.031 --> 04:27.834
Our viewers love it
when we try out the new gadgets.

04:28.368 --> 04:30.169
Great idea. What else we got?

04:30.236 --> 04:34.140
How about the teacher caught on video
berating the second grader?

04:34.440 --> 04:35.908
She apologized, didn't she?

04:35.975 --> 04:38.144
They're saying
it wasn't an isolated incident.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.646
American kids are too coddled.

04:39.712 --> 04:42.148
Rest of the world is beating us.
We need to toughen up.

04:42.215 --> 04:45.084
I think it's more complicated
than "tough love."

04:45.151 --> 04:47.687
This is an Ivy League educated woman,

04:47.754 --> 04:50.623
and she was teaching predominantly
underprivileged kids.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.692
Mostly black and Latino kids.

04:53.292 --> 04:55.595
The little girl in question,
she was black.

04:55.662 --> 04:58.665
Well, plenty to debate.
That much is obvious.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.634
What do you think, Ronda?

05:01.701 --> 05:04.170
I agree, but I like Natalie's take on it.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.305
She should do it,
since her segment was cut.

05:06.372 --> 05:08.141
But isn't Natalie covering the app?

05:08.608 --> 05:10.243
I do already have three segments.

05:10.576 --> 05:12.612
She can handle this one just fine.

05:12.679 --> 05:15.748
She also has the interview style
we're looking for.

05:16.616 --> 05:17.817
Yeah, you're right.

05:19.018 --> 05:21.587
Natalie will do the teacher story
with Justin.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.956
And Mary Jane,
you can take the "Wantagwan" piece.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.426
- And Kara, you can produce it.
- Yes.

05:28.294 --> 05:29.495
Good.

05:31.597 --> 05:33.066
Mary Jane. Come on in.

05:37.336 --> 05:41.507
Garret, I just want you to know
it's important to me to do a good job.

05:42.041 --> 05:43.276
And you are.

05:43.342 --> 05:46.713
In the meeting, it sounded like you had
a problem with my interview style.

05:47.814 --> 05:49.282
It's nothing against you.

05:49.582 --> 05:54.020
We've been doing some in-house
evaluations of on air talent...

05:54.087 --> 05:55.755
I don't mean to interrupt,

05:56.422 --> 06:00.193
but can I assume that Justin
is a part of that "we?"

06:00.626 --> 06:02.195
It's part of the show's makeover.

06:03.663 --> 06:06.432
So Justin has a problem
with my interview style?

06:11.804 --> 06:13.005
Can you grab Justin for me?

06:15.274 --> 06:16.809
It's better if he explains.

06:17.076 --> 06:20.780
Can I just say I really feel
like these evaluations should be unbiased

06:20.847 --> 06:23.983
and I worry that with Justin,
it can, you know...

06:25.084 --> 06:28.121
Hey, man. Would you mind
telling Mary Jane what you told me?

06:28.421 --> 06:29.489
Sure.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.692
I reviewed all the work
of each of the correspondents.

06:32.759 --> 06:36.095
And since you're new,
I watched a segment from SNC.

06:36.362 --> 06:39.132
I believe this is your interview
with Elizabeth Foy.

06:39.198 --> 06:42.468
Right, yeah.
Went viral, and audiences loved it.

06:44.437 --> 06:46.305
I found your approach
a little concerning.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.842
<i>It gets the politics out of the way,</i>

06:49.909 --> 06:53.045
<i>and allows the parents to decide
what's best for their child.</i>

06:53.112 --> 06:55.681
<i>It's interesting
that you mention politics,</i>

06:55.748 --> 06:58.584
<i>because some are arguing
your best-selling book is published</i>

06:58.651 --> 07:01.954
<i>by a foundation that supports
neo-racists authors.</i>

07:02.955 --> 07:04.357
You derail the conversation

07:04.423 --> 07:07.693
and promote your own agenda.
And there's no subtlety in your approach.

07:09.495 --> 07:11.631
<i>We're both fighting to be heard
and fighting</i>

07:11.697 --> 07:13.466
<i>to be taken seriously and to be seen.</i>

07:13.800 --> 07:16.936
<i>So when it comes down to it,
when I look at you,</i>

07:18.571 --> 07:20.006
<i>I see an ugly black woman too.</i>

07:21.340 --> 07:24.443
That's an ambush.
I mean, worse still, race baiting.

07:24.710 --> 07:27.914
I think your demeanor is cold.
It's judgmental. It's haughty.

07:28.981 --> 07:32.151
I don't think that's what our viewers
want with their morning coffee.

07:32.218 --> 07:34.887
Mary Jane, we all know
you have charisma and charm.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.389
And that works for the lighter pieces.

07:36.455 --> 07:38.357
It's the serious interviews...

07:39.525 --> 07:40.993
I just don't think they're for you.

07:54.707 --> 07:58.477
- This was supposed to be my comeback.
- It still is, Mary Jane.

07:58.544 --> 08:00.580
No. See what I am up against.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.215
All you need is one great story.

08:02.515 --> 08:06.152
All the great stories
are assigned to someone else.

08:06.519 --> 08:09.021
Then give them a story
that only you can do.

08:11.757 --> 08:12.925
Hey.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.030
Hello.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.466
You've barely eaten.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.535
What is all this, anyway?

08:23.402 --> 08:24.770
Old story ideas.

08:24.837 --> 08:27.173
Things I covered,
things I never got to cover.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.977
It's low tech, I know,
but I'm hoping something sparks an idea.

08:31.043 --> 08:32.745
You brought all of this from Atlanta?

08:32.812 --> 08:36.115
Yeah, that's the first thing I'd grab
if the house caught fire.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.117
Are you sure?

08:40.152 --> 08:41.888
What about this?

08:42.588 --> 08:43.656
Nick?

08:43.723 --> 08:46.893
No. Nick's been a constant companion,
but no. Nick can be replaced.

08:49.161 --> 08:50.129
Well,

08:51.998 --> 08:53.132
I'll leave you to it.

09:09.515 --> 09:11.450
<i>Feel like I'm being included
in this family.</i>

09:11.517 --> 09:13.252
<i>And then this bitch cornered me.</i>

09:13.319 --> 09:15.755
<i>She got the nerve to get in my face.</i>

09:15.821 --> 09:18.991
<i>Well, I can't hit my father. But
I'll definitely hit her because...</i>

09:19.058 --> 09:20.960
Are you enjoying your tea party
over there?

09:21.761 --> 09:23.029
You'd be drinking tea too

09:23.095 --> 09:25.998
if it wasn't for a petty,
300-year-old rebellion.

09:26.065 --> 09:29.468
No, coffee is the only way to go.
And black, as it should be.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.804
All right, Malcolm X-presso.

09:33.339 --> 09:36.142
<i>-How can you be so selfish?
- I'm not selfish!</i>

09:38.644 --> 09:39.612
Jesus.

09:40.579 --> 09:41.647
I'm sorry. Is it too loud?

09:43.616 --> 09:46.452
Sorry, I'm feeling
little claustrophobic in this hotel room.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.322
Really gotta get serious
about finding a new place.

09:50.222 --> 09:51.657
Do you know what? I do too.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.826
My sublet's up soon.

09:54.293 --> 09:56.862
My brother's showing me a listing
tomorrow afternoon.

09:58.898 --> 10:01.300
But New York is so expensive.

10:01.367 --> 10:02.601
- So expensive.
- Right?

10:08.441 --> 10:10.943
We're not actually having
this conversation now, are we?

10:11.344 --> 10:15.815
No, 'cause it's way too early
for us to be even thinking about this.

10:17.049 --> 10:18.017
Right?

10:18.985 --> 10:19.952
Right.

10:20.419 --> 10:22.154
I mean, you haven't met my kids.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.457
Exactly.

10:24.724 --> 10:26.459
And I haven't farted in front of you yet.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.027
Well, you don't need to.

10:35.701 --> 10:36.869
I love this.

10:37.269 --> 10:38.838
What are you watching?

10:38.904 --> 10:40.740
This? This is brilliant.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.809
If America does one thing great,
it is reality TV.

10:44.677 --> 10:47.313
You see this guy,
he's a retired point guard.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.582
He has multiple children
from many different moms.

10:49.648 --> 10:52.284
I'll guess: They're all forced
to live in the house together.

10:52.351 --> 10:54.820
- It's genius!
- It gives me anxiety.

10:54.887 --> 10:56.956
They are fighting over
his endorsement money.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.758
It gets pretty ugly.

10:59.358 --> 11:01.060
I'm pretty sure my niece watches this.

11:04.296 --> 11:06.565
Goodness gracious.
Who is the ratchet one?

11:06.866 --> 11:09.702
Mercedes. She's the star.
She has five children.

11:11.670 --> 11:13.272
Why do you watch this garbage again?

11:13.672 --> 11:14.807
Garbage?

11:15.408 --> 11:18.177
Let me tell you,
I get so much material from this.

11:18.244 --> 11:21.280
I consider this my Master's
in American culture.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.416
And that's a damn shame.

11:23.482 --> 11:24.717
You can judge if you want,

11:25.217 --> 11:28.454
but when Mercedes is on the screen
you cannot change the channel.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.723
<i>She is trying to get in
between the relationship</i>

11:30.790 --> 11:33.159
<i>with my father,
and that's my father, not yours.</i>

11:33.492 --> 11:34.927
<i>Find your daddy somewhere.</i>

11:36.562 --> 11:39.965
What does the league MVP do after
winning the Pennant three years in a row?

11:40.566 --> 11:41.801
Go for a fourth?

11:41.867 --> 11:45.104
<i>You're not gonna pull a Ken Griffey Jr.
on us and do a one and done, are you?</i>

11:45.171 --> 11:48.974
I had him on my fantasy team
for three years. Solid every year.

11:49.909 --> 11:51.811
<i>It's a dream come true being in New York.</i>

11:51.877 --> 11:54.847
<i>- I'm just enjoying the ride.
- We're gonna enjoy the ride with you.</i>

11:54.914 --> 11:57.383
If Aaron can't pull
a retirement announcement out of him,

11:57.883 --> 11:58.951
no one can.

11:59.018 --> 12:02.388
I don't think he's gonna say much else.
The guy's got three standard answers.

12:02.655 --> 12:03.622
Okay, wrap it up.

12:03.989 --> 12:05.591
<i>We'll be right back with Orlando Lagos,</i>

12:05.658 --> 12:07.827
<i>who's gonna show us
the key to his signature swing.</i>

12:09.528 --> 12:11.831
- He looks good too.
- He does.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.968
- You have fun doing this?
- It's the best job in the world.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.703
Yeah, how did you get started?

12:18.070 --> 12:20.573
<i>Started working
for this local TV station.</i>

12:20.906 --> 12:24.176
<i>One of the guys didn't show up one day.
They threw me in front of the camera,</i>

12:24.243 --> 12:26.178
<i>and that's pretty much
the end of the story.</i>

12:26.245 --> 12:27.446
- That's great.
- Yeah.

12:30.549 --> 12:34.086
Orlando. Hi. My name is Kara Lynch.
I'm a producer here.

12:34.153 --> 12:35.354
Hi.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.490
Can I talk to you for a minute
in private?

12:38.257 --> 12:40.726
These are my boys.
You can say what you gotta say.

12:40.793 --> 12:43.095
Tell you what,
I have a break in about an hour.

12:43.162 --> 12:45.364
Why don't you meet me
at the bar around the corner?

12:45.431 --> 12:47.032
- We can make that happen.
- Yeah?

12:47.867 --> 12:49.001
In private.

12:49.902 --> 12:51.036
Boys...

12:55.341 --> 12:56.642
<i>God, are you kidding me?</i>

12:56.709 --> 12:58.711
<i>Mercedes,
need you to stop spending money!</i>

12:58.777 --> 13:01.514
"Family Brawlers?" Seriously?

13:01.580 --> 13:04.884
- Girl, it's so bad, it's good.
- God.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.021
<i>Here comes Carmen
talkin' outta the side of her neck...</i>

13:09.088 --> 13:11.957
Yeah, that's her little catchphrase.

13:12.558 --> 13:14.894
What do you think
about bringing her on the show?

13:14.960 --> 13:17.229
What? Mercedes Wilkerson? On live TV?

13:17.296 --> 13:21.567
Yeah. Think about it.
This is a story only I can do.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.770
If I can find a way
to relate to this woman,

13:24.837 --> 13:28.707
get her on my side, humanize her
a little bit, it could be good.

13:28.774 --> 13:31.677
- That woman's a damn train wreck.
- She's playing a character.

13:31.744 --> 13:34.013
I'm sure there's a real person
under there.

13:34.079 --> 13:35.548
And I'm pretty sure I can find it.

13:35.614 --> 13:38.517
So you wanna turn your app story
into a hard-hitting interview?

13:38.784 --> 13:40.920
She could use the app during the show
and bring in

13:40.986 --> 13:43.255
that young demo Garrett wants so badly.

13:43.956 --> 13:45.224
Come on.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.226
Justin's gonna shoot this down faster

13:47.293 --> 13:49.795
than you can say
"talkin' out the side your neck."

13:49.862 --> 13:53.432
I thought about that.
I think I figured out a way around that.

13:55.367 --> 13:58.404
So the weight loss special
rounds out the 8 a.m. block.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.406
- Any pitches for 9 a.m.?
- I have one.

14:00.472 --> 14:01.607
Yes.

14:01.674 --> 14:05.110
How about an interview with the star
of the reality series "Family Brawlers?"

14:05.744 --> 14:07.546
- Mercedes Wilkerson?
- Yes.

14:07.613 --> 14:10.549
Isn't that the crazy woman
that put her boyfriend in the hospital

14:10.616 --> 14:12.184
with a toaster oven or something?

14:12.251 --> 14:14.186
I think it was a microwave.

14:14.253 --> 14:16.222
She's definitely a bit of wild child.

14:16.288 --> 14:20.192
But she tripled the demo when
she appeared on talk shows in Atlanta,

14:20.259 --> 14:21.994
Los Angeles and Chicago.

14:22.061 --> 14:24.630
She's coming out with a new swimwear line
we can feature,

14:24.697 --> 14:26.899
which is a bridge to our 18 to 34 demo

14:26.966 --> 14:29.101
and cross promotion
with our sister network.

14:30.169 --> 14:32.404
- The suits will love that.
- Yeah.

14:32.471 --> 14:34.073
- Who should do it?
- How about Ronda?

14:36.609 --> 14:37.676
No.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.713
No, that's not really my brand.

14:40.779 --> 14:42.014
Come on, now. Come on.

14:42.081 --> 14:45.150
She's very popular with the app
Mary Jane is covering.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.920
Yeah, Mary Jane, you did a good job
with that hip-hop artist.

14:47.987 --> 14:50.022
Okay. Mercedes is a powder keg.

14:50.456 --> 14:52.625
We don't need Mary Jane
to light that fuse.

14:52.691 --> 14:54.893
Let's remember
who our intended audience is.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.195
Then you produce it.

14:57.696 --> 15:02.101
Justin doesn't know the show,
so I don't...

15:02.434 --> 15:07.206
Great. He'll approach it with fresh eyes
and find an interesting angle.

15:07.273 --> 15:08.707
Yeah, let's put it on the board.

15:10.542 --> 15:12.978
I like it. I think we got a winner, guys.

15:14.113 --> 15:16.448
Can I talk to you about that segment?
Yeah.

15:21.353 --> 15:23.322
- Nice strategy.
- What do you mean?

15:23.389 --> 15:27.092
Getting Kara to pitch a story
you knew Ronda would refuse to do.

15:27.159 --> 15:29.628
I expected Ronda to support her people.

15:29.962 --> 15:31.163
This is serious.

15:31.497 --> 15:34.433
Thanks to you, we're now saddled
with the inglorious task

15:34.500 --> 15:38.070
of transforming a hood rat
into respectable morning TV.

15:38.137 --> 15:41.740
- I have an approach.
- You do? Good. Here we go. Enlighten me.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.644
It saddens you, doesn't it?

15:47.012 --> 15:50.516
To know that I'm not selling perfume
at a kiosk in the mall?

15:50.582 --> 15:52.751
That's what you expected
when you got me fired.

15:52.818 --> 15:53.852
I never got you fired.

15:53.919 --> 15:55.587
No, you just badmouthed me
to the higher-ups.

15:55.654 --> 15:58.924
You needed to make yourself
indispensable, and you didn't.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.228
You're so used to being the golden boy.

16:04.430 --> 16:06.799
What are you gonna do now
that you're Ronda's puppet?

16:08.467 --> 16:09.601
You didn't know?

16:11.236 --> 16:14.973
The only reason Ronda has you here
is to make my life miserable.

16:15.040 --> 16:19.812
- At least I got this job on merit.
- Just like you did at CNN and SNC.

16:20.612 --> 16:21.580
Question:

16:21.947 --> 16:23.515
Do you have what it takes to keep it?

16:28.053 --> 16:30.522
You may have an approach to this segment.

16:31.724 --> 16:35.160
But the way I see it,
you either follow my instructions

16:35.527 --> 16:36.862
or do it your way

16:37.563 --> 16:40.432
and prove to the world
why I was right about you.

16:46.071 --> 16:48.006
Let's talk about why we're really here.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.342
Not to enjoy each other's company?

16:52.611 --> 16:53.879
I have a proposition for you.

16:54.580 --> 16:55.848
Okay.

16:55.914 --> 16:57.883
A business proposition.

17:00.085 --> 17:03.789
Your RBI stats have been down, right?
That's because of an injury?

17:04.423 --> 17:06.759
I'm not interested
in doing another interview.

17:06.825 --> 17:09.161
Yeah,
but I know you want to be on camera.

17:11.397 --> 17:14.566
Maybe you haven't heard,
but I have a pretty damn good day job.

17:15.033 --> 17:16.068
Okay.

17:17.069 --> 17:18.470
Little piece of advice?

17:19.304 --> 17:21.740
You want to get out
while at the top of your game.

17:21.807 --> 17:24.243
And if you're looking to be
the next Michael Strahan,

17:25.911 --> 17:28.113
- I can help you.
- Are you this bold with everyone?

17:29.314 --> 17:30.449
Everybody.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.019
I have to ask, what's in it for you?

17:34.086 --> 17:37.189
Let's just say, making you look good
makes me look even better.

17:39.358 --> 17:41.527
All right. If I were interested,

17:41.860 --> 17:43.228
how exactly could you help me?

17:49.334 --> 17:50.335
Hey.

17:51.603 --> 17:54.306
Garrett, Garrett...

17:54.373 --> 17:57.409
I want to bring Orlando Lagos
back on the show.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.545
He's gonna announce his retirement?

17:59.611 --> 18:01.680
- No.
- Then why would we bring him back?

18:01.747 --> 18:04.750
I think he'd be great
for the college athlete union story.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.786
You want Orlando Lagos
to be a sports pundit?

18:08.187 --> 18:09.822
Listen, I can work with him.

18:09.888 --> 18:12.324
And he has a lot of respect
for what we're doing here.

18:12.858 --> 18:16.628
Athletes like him think
we're all the same: Pinheads with a mic.

18:16.695 --> 18:19.698
No. I overheard him
talking to his buddies earlier.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.733
He actually likes
the way we cover sports.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.202
He says we get it right.

18:25.637 --> 18:28.740
- Okay. Try it.
- Great. Thank you.

18:28.807 --> 18:29.908
Yeah.

18:31.109 --> 18:32.110
Yes!

18:32.644 --> 18:34.346
What I'm trying to say is, college...

18:34.413 --> 18:36.415
Don't look at your notes. Trust yourself.

18:37.382 --> 18:41.086
College sports programs
bring in millions of dollars a year.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.288
- I mean billions...
- Okay, look.

18:44.556 --> 18:46.625
Eyes on me. Chin down.

18:47.493 --> 18:48.460
Yes.

18:49.228 --> 18:52.231
Billions of dollars every year.
And the kids...

18:54.333 --> 18:56.735
Students. The student athletes...

18:58.136 --> 18:59.471
Okay, don't say "um."

18:59.738 --> 19:02.241
- I don't know anything about this.
- Orlando, listen.

19:02.307 --> 19:05.410
I know college sports is not your thing,
but if you wanna be an anchor,

19:05.477 --> 19:07.846
you'll have to talk about subjects
that don't interest you.

19:09.882 --> 19:10.949
Come over here.

19:16.889 --> 19:17.890
What?

19:20.692 --> 19:21.827
Hello...

19:22.227 --> 19:24.062
How'd you know my favorite way to relax?

19:24.796 --> 19:27.199
- No more tie.
- Okay.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.680
You know what?
What do you do to prep for a game?

19:41.747 --> 19:43.549
Do you have any rituals or anything?

19:43.615 --> 19:44.883
Yeah, every player does.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.485
- What are they?
- A few things.

19:46.552 --> 19:48.787
I have a playlist I listen to
the day of the game.

19:48.854 --> 19:49.922
I put on my lucky jersey.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.557
Lucky jersey. Do you have that here?

19:51.857 --> 19:53.592
- Yeah, of course.
- Yes. Go put it on.

19:53.659 --> 19:54.726
Why?

19:54.793 --> 19:56.895
'Cause we gotta loosen you up.
You're too tight.

20:12.811 --> 20:14.746
- What?
- That's your lucky jersey?

20:14.813 --> 20:17.349
I batted a 750 my senior year
in this jersey.

20:18.517 --> 20:20.619
My record still stands at Atlantic High.

20:20.686 --> 20:22.721
You don't need college
with stats like that.

20:22.788 --> 20:23.722
Yeah.

20:24.289 --> 20:26.325
I brought a little something
that's gonna help.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.700
- Extra Añejo?
- That's right.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.537
- Lady got fine taste.
- Always.

20:42.007 --> 20:45.644
Now, if this doesn't warm you up,
I don't know what will.

20:48.580 --> 20:52.951
You're really putting Mercedes Wilkerson
on the morning show?

20:53.018 --> 20:54.353
Yeah, tomorrow.

20:54.419 --> 20:57.789
That girl gets famous for throwing
a kitchen appliance at her boyfriend,

20:58.056 --> 21:01.393
and now she's being interviewed about it
on national television.

21:01.860 --> 21:03.395
God bless America.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.297
That is the business I'm in.

21:06.632 --> 21:08.600
She should get a spinoff.

21:09.034 --> 21:11.303
Call it "12 Years a Stripper."

21:12.638 --> 21:14.306
No? I'll work on it.

21:14.373 --> 21:16.675
My brother showed me that loft
in Chelsea.

21:16.742 --> 21:18.176
- You like it?
- I love it.

21:18.577 --> 21:20.178
It blows my budget out the water.

21:20.846 --> 21:23.548
I still have to paint and replace
all the toilets...

21:24.416 --> 21:25.951
You said replace all the toilets?

21:26.451 --> 21:27.686
Well, at least the seats.

21:27.753 --> 21:29.287
Are you that much of a germophobe?

21:29.354 --> 21:31.957
I'm not a germophobe. I'm not!

21:32.557 --> 21:35.427
- I just like my shit new, that's all.
- Literally.

21:35.494 --> 21:37.696
I'm sure
you've got some quirky preferences.

21:38.263 --> 21:39.364
No, not really.

21:40.098 --> 21:42.200
As long as it's got a nice vibe.

21:42.267 --> 21:43.468
Really? Come on.

21:43.535 --> 21:44.703
Okay.

21:45.871 --> 21:46.972
Radiators.

21:48.006 --> 21:50.175
It's one of the things
I love about New York.

21:50.509 --> 21:53.278
The old, clanky radiators.
Makes me feel like home.

21:53.679 --> 21:54.913
What's wrong with central heat?

21:54.980 --> 21:57.883
What? Blowing random,
mysterious hot air into your apartment?

21:57.949 --> 21:59.384
Where's it coming from?

22:00.419 --> 22:02.020
- Anything else?
- No.

22:03.088 --> 22:04.222
All I need

22:05.157 --> 22:06.258
is a strong bed,

22:07.459 --> 22:08.660
a beautiful woman...

22:09.027 --> 22:11.697
And a shelf on the pantry
for all of your teas.

22:13.398 --> 22:15.667
- You think you know me so well.
- Okay, anything else?

22:17.502 --> 22:19.905
This is so important.
It's gonna say a lot about you.

22:20.405 --> 22:22.841
Carpet or hardwood?

22:25.310 --> 22:26.778
- Yeah, that's tough.
- Yeah.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.082
Excuse me, mate. Can we stop here?

22:31.049 --> 22:33.185
I want to know a bit more
about your preferences.

22:34.052 --> 22:37.856
Now, are you an S or an M?

22:38.890 --> 22:41.393
No, I know. Definitely an S.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.328
What makes you say that?

22:43.395 --> 22:47.432
You're kind of alpha, type A.
You like to be in control.

22:49.568 --> 22:50.936
Too tame, honey.

22:55.373 --> 22:56.541
Hello.

22:58.977 --> 23:00.278
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:00.579 --> 23:03.548
Well, I am a huge fan of your ass, so...

23:04.182 --> 23:06.451
No, honey, not for me.

23:07.252 --> 23:10.122
- For you.
- No. That's not my thing.

23:11.123 --> 23:13.492
Although I don't mind a bit of...

23:18.196 --> 23:19.264
Yeah.

23:21.800 --> 23:22.768
Right.

23:23.935 --> 23:25.103
Let me break it down for you.

23:25.170 --> 23:27.906
College sports programs
bring in billions a year,

23:27.973 --> 23:30.709
and these student athletes
don't see a dime of that money.

23:30.776 --> 23:34.012
And they're the ones bustin' their asses
day in and day out.

23:36.014 --> 23:37.048
How was that?

23:37.816 --> 23:40.185
- Not bad.
- Bullshit. That was perfect.

23:40.519 --> 23:41.753
I wouldn't say perfect.

23:42.220 --> 23:44.556
- Like you could do better?
- Absolutely. Yeah, I could.

23:45.824 --> 23:46.925
Prove it.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.394
Okay.

23:50.495 --> 23:51.897
Take this. You're gonna need it.

23:55.066 --> 23:56.168
Yeah.

23:57.435 --> 23:58.503
Okay.

24:03.909 --> 24:08.079
Unionization would allow athletes
the bargaining power they deserve,

24:08.146 --> 24:12.617
and it would open a way for much needed
medical insurance and disability...

24:13.819 --> 24:15.654
- What are you laughing at?
- I'm sorry.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.424
I can't take you seriously like this.
Is that how I look on camera?

24:19.991 --> 24:22.661
No. You actually look like this.

24:25.363 --> 24:28.400
"Yo, yo! I think all baseball
players need to be unionized.

24:28.466 --> 24:29.668
You know what I'm saying?"

24:29.734 --> 24:31.937
- Get out of...
- That's what you look like.

24:32.003 --> 24:34.039
Gotta take a picture of this.
You look so cute.

24:37.609 --> 24:38.577
Yeah...

24:41.546 --> 24:42.514
Yeah...

24:43.648 --> 24:44.616
- Like this?
- Yeah.

24:51.957 --> 24:53.325
- No, wait.
- Right.

24:58.196 --> 25:01.066
- I'ma just take...
- Yeah, man. You should.

25:01.132 --> 25:03.134
- Yeah.
- All right.

25:04.970 --> 25:06.037
Thank you.

25:07.539 --> 25:09.207
You did wash it, I hope?

25:09.274 --> 25:13.144
Yes, of course I washed it.
But it sort of ruined the moment.

25:13.211 --> 25:14.746
I get it.

25:15.247 --> 25:18.717
But you know what?
Good for you for trying something, right?

25:18.783 --> 25:21.119
Something new
for the sacrifice of someone else.

25:21.186 --> 25:24.122
That's what a good relationship
is all about.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.824
My god. Yeah, okay.

25:27.125 --> 25:29.227
We're shooting Orlando's piece.
Wish me luck.

25:29.294 --> 25:31.897
I will cross my stink finger for you.

25:31.963 --> 25:35.500
<i>They don't see a penny of that money
for exchange for endless travel,</i>

25:35.567 --> 25:38.336
<i>long practices, and sometimes lifelong,
lasting injury.</i>

25:39.905 --> 25:41.139
He improved a lot.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.910
Yeah. Just took a little practice,
a little loosening up,

25:44.976 --> 25:47.812
and he's wearing his lucky jersey
under his suit, so...

25:49.814 --> 25:51.016
That helps.

25:52.017 --> 25:53.985
Hanging out with Lagos. Impressive.

25:57.222 --> 26:00.191
Did he mention anything
about the retirement rumors?

26:02.694 --> 26:05.430
I might be able to get us an exclusive.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.667
But I'd like to run
some story ideas by you first.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.268
Let's talk.

26:10.568 --> 26:12.237
- Great.
- My door is always open, you know.

26:30.322 --> 26:31.456
That's not what I ordered.

26:32.691 --> 26:33.792
Mercedes is here.

26:36.494 --> 26:38.763
Yeah, no. That's not gonna work.

26:38.830 --> 26:40.265
All right. Hold on.

26:42.801 --> 26:45.570
I'm gonna go with my own questions
for this, but thank you.

26:45.637 --> 26:48.239
Read it or get taken off of the segment.

26:52.577 --> 26:55.413
- They're all about her swimwear line.
- That's what you pitched, isn't it?

26:55.480 --> 26:58.149
Yeah, but I also want
to have a real conversation with her.

26:58.216 --> 27:00.785
Have the chance to ask her
what it's like to be a black woman

27:00.852 --> 27:03.021
like her living her life
in front of the camera.

27:03.088 --> 27:05.256
It's not about being black.
It's about swimsuits.

27:06.424 --> 27:07.592
So I'm back.

27:09.094 --> 27:11.396
Well, listen.
Let's try and find some time...

27:12.530 --> 27:15.200
I see your reality star has arrived.

27:15.266 --> 27:19.270
She's a very colorful character.
You're gonna have your hands full.

27:19.337 --> 27:22.173
Okay, she's not a head of state.
I get that.

27:22.240 --> 27:25.643
But young people relate to her,
and that's what it's about: millennials.

27:25.710 --> 27:28.380
You know, the one thing I learned
from playing tennis

27:28.813 --> 27:31.116
is that to be the best,
you have to play the best.

27:31.182 --> 27:35.553
And that is especially true
in this newsroom, dear. Young or old.

27:35.620 --> 27:39.324
We're only as good
as the people that we sit next to.

27:41.559 --> 27:43.962
Mercedes, thank you so much
for coming on the show.

27:44.029 --> 27:46.364
<i>I'm so excited
to talk about your new swimsuit line.</i>

27:46.431 --> 27:47.932
<i>It's actually swimsuit lingerie.</i>

27:48.533 --> 27:50.201
<i>Interesting. Now, what exactly is it?</i>

27:50.535 --> 27:53.204
- It's underwear for swimmin'.
- Fascinating!

27:53.271 --> 27:54.806
Let's see what you have here.

27:54.873 --> 27:56.408
Let me show you.

27:59.244 --> 28:01.813
<i>This one here is showing
that you're confident, sexy,</i>

28:02.180 --> 28:03.548
<i>but you don't need a man.</i>

28:03.615 --> 28:05.283
<i>- Very nice.
- Yes, it sure is.</i>

28:05.350 --> 28:07.052
It's called the No-Boo-Dini Bikini.

28:07.118 --> 28:11.022
Like a bandini, like a two-piece.
Wonderful. That is delightful.

28:11.089 --> 28:13.525
I don't know if mine
is your style or not.

28:13.591 --> 28:16.761
You more of a one-black-piece girl type.
But I ain't the one to judge.

28:16.828 --> 28:19.297
<i>- Next, next ass, come here!
- No. I would absolutely...</i>

28:19.364 --> 28:21.266
Stay on the high side of the fence.

28:21.332 --> 28:26.004
I'd absolutely die to rock one of those
very stylish vogue pieces.

28:26.271 --> 28:28.306
<i>Great for the beach and the bedroom,
right?</i>

28:28.706 --> 28:29.808
Sexy and glowing, right?

28:29.874 --> 28:33.178
Yeah. Now,
where can our audience find these?

28:33.244 --> 28:34.646
They can find it at Z-BEN.

28:34.712 --> 28:36.915
- What's Z-BEN?
- It's my pop-up shop.

28:36.981 --> 28:39.384
<i>When and where
will this pop-up shop pop up?</i>

28:39.451 --> 28:41.519
<i>You see, that's the secret.</i>

28:41.586 --> 28:44.722
<i>They have to get it
after I present them on "Wantagwan."</i>

28:44.789 --> 28:45.924
So it's a secret.

28:45.990 --> 28:48.193
You sure you don't want
to let us in on that secret?

28:48.259 --> 28:50.128
We've got five million viewers
right here.

28:50.862 --> 28:54.165
<i>No. What I need is somebody younger
who interview me,</i>

28:54.232 --> 28:56.668
who actually know what the hell
they talking about...

28:56.734 --> 28:59.137
<i>- This was such a bad idea.
- when it comes to fashion.</i>

28:59.204 --> 29:02.941
<i>Your ass is too narrow
to fit in one of my suits. You know?</i>

29:03.808 --> 29:05.110
Let's wrap this up, please.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.313
Well, thank you.

29:08.379 --> 29:12.417
You can see Mercedes Wilkerson
and all of the "Family Brawlers" misfits

29:12.484 --> 29:15.053
every Monday night at 9 p.m. on VMT.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.589
And for those of you
looking to find Mercedes' fashions,

29:17.889 --> 29:20.358
you can find those being sold
out of the trunk of her car

29:20.425 --> 29:21.993
in the parking lot of a strip club.

29:22.327 --> 29:23.294
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

29:30.168 --> 29:32.070
That's one sadity-ass bitch right there.

29:35.573 --> 29:38.510
Listen, you backwards-ass,
country bamma bitch,

29:38.576 --> 29:41.279
- I was trying to help you.
- Help me? I don't need your help.

29:41.346 --> 29:43.281
Do you know who the hell I am?
I'm a Mercedes.

29:43.348 --> 29:45.283
You're not a damn fashion designer.

29:45.350 --> 29:47.418
You breed for a living.

29:47.485 --> 29:48.887
I breed for rich men.

29:48.953 --> 29:51.089
What the hell do you do
besides walk around here

29:51.156 --> 29:53.258
trying to act all white
and cute or whatever?

29:53.591 --> 29:55.326
Next time, swallow your kids, bitch.

29:55.393 --> 29:57.495
Swallow my kids? All right.

29:57.562 --> 29:59.364
I'm getting the bad bitch out of you.

29:59.430 --> 30:02.066
Look at you! All this time,
I thought you was

30:02.133 --> 30:03.801
one black girl trying to be white,

30:03.868 --> 30:06.204
but I see you, girl.
I like that one right there.

30:08.106 --> 30:10.775
I'm sorry. Y'all made me
come out my face, and I'm...

30:11.276 --> 30:15.079
I don't even know how you even work
in this sadity-ass place.

30:16.047 --> 30:17.682
You know, you do what you gotta do.

30:17.749 --> 30:20.752
Keep doing it, bitch.
'Cause you doing one hell of a good job.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.154
"Swallow my kids."

30:26.591 --> 30:27.759
Mary Jane.

30:28.826 --> 30:30.595
I already know what you're gonna say.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.630
You went kamikaze
with my name on the line.

30:32.697 --> 30:34.933
I actually hoped you'd prove me wrong.

30:36.134 --> 30:37.368
But I knew you couldn't do it.

30:49.814 --> 30:52.150
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to see the listing.

30:52.850 --> 30:54.986
I know I'm early,
but I had to get out of the office.

30:55.053 --> 30:56.621
And I know I told you
I had an appointment.

30:58.156 --> 30:59.123
So you're not gonna let me in?

31:02.193 --> 31:05.263
PJ, if you are banging
some young hottie in there,

31:05.330 --> 31:07.265
in a 15 million dollar apartment...

31:07.332 --> 31:10.101
Stop!
I told you, there is nobody in here.

31:10.835 --> 31:12.837
Let me in. Open the door. Let me in.

31:14.839 --> 31:15.873
Fine.

31:17.208 --> 31:18.776
'Letta, this is Greta.

31:19.077 --> 31:22.113
You have to book her three weeks
in advance. She's just that good.

31:22.180 --> 31:23.848
You should try her sometimes.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.450
I'm sorry.

31:25.516 --> 31:27.385
Look, I can't even get mad at you

31:27.452 --> 31:31.556
because the old me, he probably
would've had a chick in here.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.391
- Yeah, I know.
- For sure.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.827
Yes. But I've had enough drama
the past year.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.129
Sounds like you can relate.

31:38.463 --> 31:39.664
I can relate.

31:40.999 --> 31:44.569
The client that owns this place,
she's really taken me under her wing.

31:45.103 --> 31:46.437
I'm not trying to mess that up.

31:47.171 --> 31:48.740
You got people looking out for you.

31:50.108 --> 31:52.176
- I like it. That's important.
- It is.

31:53.244 --> 31:56.414
I'll arrange it so that
you can show yourself the place.

31:56.481 --> 31:59.183
But if you like it,
you gotta let me know ASAP.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.120
I already got a couple clients
looking at it, chomping at the bit.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.688
All right.

32:04.522 --> 32:05.757
Nice meeting you, Greta.

32:06.557 --> 32:07.659
You can go.

32:11.229 --> 32:13.665
I practically exploded on live TV.

32:14.299 --> 32:16.034
Pretty sure my mom had a stroke.

32:16.301 --> 32:18.670
For what it's worth,
I thought it was pretty funny.

32:21.105 --> 32:24.008
This place will make me
forget all of my troubles.

32:26.077 --> 32:27.211
What do you think?

32:29.280 --> 32:30.381
It's nice.

32:30.682 --> 32:31.849
It's nice?

32:32.383 --> 32:33.685
This place is wavy.

32:36.854 --> 32:39.324
Don't tell me you're serious
about the radiator thing.

32:41.159 --> 32:44.595
No, it's cool. I'll hold out until
I find a place with clanky radiators.

32:45.630 --> 32:46.597
Mary Jane...

32:47.198 --> 32:50.068
If you like this place, buy it.

32:50.868 --> 32:54.872
- But buy it for you.
- Yeah, I am. I'm just thinking ahead.

32:55.340 --> 32:58.609
Are you, though?
I'm sensing some urgency here.

32:58.676 --> 33:03.648
No, I know you're not moving in
right away, but you might one day, right?

33:04.982 --> 33:07.852
I can't even consider that question
until you've met my kids.

33:08.119 --> 33:09.454
No, I get that.

33:09.954 --> 33:12.423
But I'm about to spend a small fortune
on this place,

33:12.890 --> 33:14.425
and I'd really like your opinion.

33:15.526 --> 33:19.464
My opinion is you're buying this place
for two, not for one.

33:21.265 --> 33:23.568
Okay, I'll just put
the rest of my life on hold

33:23.634 --> 33:25.703
until you're ready
to have a conversation.

33:25.770 --> 33:28.373
MJ, that's the exact opposite
to what I've just said.

33:29.707 --> 33:31.976
Look, I say "not now"
and you hear "not ever."

33:33.511 --> 33:35.747
I've had way too many
dead-end relationships, Lee.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.148
I'm over it.

33:38.082 --> 33:40.051
No more games, okay?

33:41.486 --> 33:43.321
Are you in or out?

33:44.856 --> 33:47.358
I've told you I'm not moving in with you.

33:52.029 --> 33:53.097
Fine.

33:54.999 --> 33:56.100
Get the hell out.

33:59.103 --> 34:00.838
- Mary Jane...
- I mean it, Lee. Leave.

34:02.073 --> 34:03.107
Leave!

34:13.217 --> 34:15.319
- Hey.
- Everybody's staring at me.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.055
Have you seen your Twitter feed?

34:18.122 --> 34:21.092
Hell no. I've been avoiding
the Internet like the plague.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.528
Well, your rant went viral, Missy.

34:23.594 --> 34:25.596
- Let me see that.
- Look at the Twitter feed.

34:25.663 --> 34:29.167
All the pundits
are talking about double consciousness.

34:29.434 --> 34:33.137
Van Jones schooled a panel
about how black professionals

34:33.204 --> 34:35.072
have to be one way
around their white colleagues

34:35.139 --> 34:36.974
and another way
around other black people.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.844
And Melissa Harris Perry
wants an interview.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.279
- Shut up.
- Yes.

34:41.345 --> 34:43.848
And there's also
a "Huffington Post" editorial

34:43.915 --> 34:46.417
talking about
"dropping the mask" at work.

34:47.418 --> 34:50.922
So you said you wanted to do
something meaningful, and you did.

34:50.988 --> 34:53.658
So we need to celebrate tonight.
You gotta call Lee.

34:54.258 --> 34:55.393
About that...

34:55.860 --> 34:57.028
What did you do?

34:57.829 --> 34:59.030
I'll tell you later.

35:01.499 --> 35:02.533
Okay.

35:02.834 --> 35:04.135
Celebrate my ratchet.

35:04.402 --> 35:05.636
Celebrate.

35:13.110 --> 35:16.781
I suppose congratulations are in order.
You and Mercedes broke the Internet.

35:17.114 --> 35:20.685
Yet, I feel like I owe you an apology
for what I said on air. I'm so sorry.

35:21.085 --> 35:24.055
No need to apologize for being a hit.
We should capitalize on it.

35:24.655 --> 35:26.924
Ronda came up with a great way
to do just that.

35:26.991 --> 35:28.226
- She did?
- Yeah.

35:28.292 --> 35:31.596
She suggested you become
our resident web correspondent.

35:33.498 --> 35:35.933
So instead of being on on-air,
I'll be on the Internet?

35:36.534 --> 35:38.503
Hey, the web is the future, right?

36:29.554 --> 36:30.521
Hey.

36:32.023 --> 36:32.957
Hey.

36:35.893 --> 36:36.994
TV's off.

36:38.596 --> 36:40.798
New episode
of "Family Brawlers" is about to start.

36:42.466 --> 36:43.534
I thought we broke up.

36:44.502 --> 36:45.469
We did?

36:47.071 --> 36:48.039
When?

36:48.339 --> 36:49.874
When I told you to get out.

36:50.808 --> 36:51.976
Well, we had an argument.

36:52.376 --> 36:54.946
You told me to leave, so I did.
It's what adults do.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.214
We argue, and we work it out.

36:58.316 --> 37:01.586
Plus, I thought I'd give you some time
to tell me what's really going on.

37:04.989 --> 37:07.358
- That place was dope.
- This is Manhattan.

37:07.858 --> 37:10.061
It's an island full of dope apartments.

37:13.531 --> 37:15.166
Why are you suddenly trying to rush this?

37:17.535 --> 37:18.970
I turn 40 in two months.

37:20.104 --> 37:21.072
Join the club.

37:23.741 --> 37:25.610
I turn 40, and I imagined

37:27.345 --> 37:28.713
where I'd be, and...

37:31.148 --> 37:36.621
I guess I just tried to race to get there
before the clock struck 12.

37:37.622 --> 37:39.056
So, this had nothing to do with me.

37:39.523 --> 37:41.993
It was just about you
checking off some boxes.

37:45.229 --> 37:47.932
Why is settling down
such an accomplishment in America?

37:50.301 --> 37:51.435
I don't know. You tell me.

37:53.604 --> 37:54.538
Hey.

37:55.573 --> 37:57.608
Forty is the new thirty.

37:58.909 --> 38:00.745
It's the new 20
when you're a black woman.

38:01.178 --> 38:03.047
- Especially one that looks like you.
- Stop.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.088
Still sucks
to let that beautiful place go.

38:11.155 --> 38:14.825
No, not at all. The central heating
would've killed you eventually.

38:16.861 --> 38:18.896
Plus, I don't want my kids
breathing that in.

38:20.564 --> 38:22.867
They're gonna come visit
for spring break.

38:23.601 --> 38:26.037
They wanted to go to Spain,
but I want you to meet them.

38:30.608 --> 38:33.477
Let go of what you think
is supposed to happen.

38:35.579 --> 38:36.547
Just let it be.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.022
Come here.

38:53.731 --> 38:55.332
So are we watching this or not?

38:56.634 --> 38:57.601
- Yeah.
- Great.

39:01.639 --> 39:02.907
Just give me a minute.

39:25.596 --> 39:26.797
What are you doing here?

39:27.832 --> 39:29.467
Every win must be celebrated.

39:36.774 --> 39:40.010
I don't gotta worry about Daekwan.
I don't gotta worry about Lucretia.

39:40.077 --> 39:41.912
I don't gotta worry about Aunt Shaunae.

39:41.979 --> 39:45.583
I don't gotta worry about
none of them, especially Carmen...

39:46.317 --> 39:47.685
<i>that's not even his daughter.</i>

39:48.986 --> 39:50.521
Did you really think we'd broken up?

39:52.823 --> 39:55.025
Yeah, I did.

39:56.293 --> 39:58.295
Well, congratulations.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.699
You're about to celebrate your 40th.

40:02.833 --> 40:05.569
And it looks like
you might be in a real relationship.

40:05.970 --> 40:06.937
What?
