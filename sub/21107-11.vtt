19:37.243 --> 19:39.710
See you for hot lava yoga.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.078
For sure.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.313
No. Stop.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.281
Argh.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.750
Why won't anyone believe me?

19:45.752 --> 19:46.884
(KLAUS CLAPPING)

19:46.886 --> 19:51.022
Congratulations
on being so wrong.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.090
Want to know how I did it?

19:53.092 --> 19:55.459
Well, like any evil
crazy person,

19:55.461 --> 19:57.995
I assume you'll tell me
regardless.

19:57.997 --> 19:58.963
True.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.132
<i>I noticed Mr. Donaldson</i>
<i>was sweating</i>

20:01.134 --> 20:03.367
<i>and he made a big puddle.</i>

20:03.369 --> 20:04.502
(CACKLING)

20:04.504 --> 20:06.571
<i>I bribed my harp teacher,</i>
<i>Ronnie,</i>

20:06.573 --> 20:08.272
<i>to pretend to be</i>
<i>the Fang Fairy,</i>

20:08.274 --> 20:10.775
<i>and I scared those rotten</i>
<i>witches good.</i>

20:10.777 --> 20:12.476
(CHIPMUNK CHATTERS)

20:13.212 --> 20:17.682
Then I put on my sporty gear
to go steal your friends,

20:17.684 --> 20:20.851
<i>while I left my clothes</i>
<i>in the lost and found.</i>

20:20.853 --> 20:21.786
(KLAUS LAUGHS)

20:21.788 --> 20:24.055
"Property of Klaus.
Claws off."

20:24.057 --> 20:25.389
Ugh. How'd I miss that?

20:25.391 --> 20:27.658
Wait, what about
the extra fang?

20:27.660 --> 20:29.126
Nature's lottery ticket.

20:29.128 --> 20:31.395
I was actually born with five.

20:31.663 --> 20:32.430
Ew. Gross.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.965
I didn't say
it would be pretty.

20:33.967 --> 20:36.300
So, wait. I actually did
figure it all out.

20:36.302 --> 20:39.203
You set me up just to get
your fang transplanted?

20:39.205 --> 20:40.071
But why?

20:40.073 --> 20:41.239
I already told you.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.841
Remember?
Our first Vamp-Off.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.977
(SIGHS) You win.

20:45.979 --> 20:47.111
I guess.

20:47.113 --> 20:50.214
Yes. I am the Vamp-Off King.

20:50.916 --> 20:54.685
Booty shaking, booty shaking,
booty in your face, ah.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.988
(GROANING)
Good game.

20:56.990 --> 20:58.122
Up high.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.223
Down low.

20:59.225 --> 21:00.358
Too slow.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.259
Too slow.

21:01.261 --> 21:04.962
I'll show you too slow!

21:05.264 --> 21:09.000
And 76 short years later,
revenge.

21:09.002 --> 21:11.435
You and your friends
laughed at me?

21:11.437 --> 21:14.572
Well, now I've stolen
your friends.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.508
To laugh at you.
(CACKLING)

21:17.510 --> 21:18.342
You did?

21:18.344 --> 21:19.443
Yes. Of course I did.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.879
I turned Mavis into a creature
so hideous

21:21.881 --> 21:26.217
that instead you'd
want to hang with your
lovable pal, Klaus.

21:26.219 --> 21:30.121
But you basically turned
Mavis into you.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.989
Exactly. And...

21:32.324 --> 21:33.958
Oh. I see.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.127
And anyway,
Mavis is our best bud.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.763
We go together like
blood and guts.

21:38.765 --> 21:43.267
We aren't dumping her
for any Klaus-come-lately.

21:43.269 --> 21:44.702
It's Klaus-hh.

21:44.704 --> 21:47.538
Well, whatever it was,
you got me.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.273
Good one, Klaus-hh.

21:49.474 --> 21:51.075
Psych. Too slow.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.277
(LAUGHING)

21:53.279 --> 21:54.912
Yes, psych.

21:54.914 --> 21:59.116
We'll see who gets
the last laugh, Mavis.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.319
MAVIS:
We can still hear you.

22:01.620 --> 22:02.920
Rats.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.789
(SCREAMS) Rats!

22:06.024 --> 22:07.858
(MUSIC PLAYING)

22:09.461 --> 22:10.761
Ha-ha.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.763

22:15.334 --> 22:16.634
Ha-ha.
