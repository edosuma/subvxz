02:49.360 --> 02:52.603
Before we proceed any further,
hear me speak.

02:53.840 --> 02:57.083
You are all resolved
rather to die than to famish?

02:57.280 --> 02:59.601
Resolved.

02:59.760 --> 03:03.685
First, you know Caius Martius
is chief enemy to the people.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.242
We know it.
- Let us kill him.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.961
And we'll have corn at our own price.

03:12.120 --> 03:16.205
We are accounted poor citizens,
the patricians good.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.482
The leanness that afflicts us,

03:19.640 --> 03:23.964
the object of our misery,
our suffering, is a gain to them.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.167
Aye...

03:25.320 --> 03:29.325
Let us revenge this with our sticks,
ere we become rakes.

03:29.520 --> 03:30.726
No more talking on it. Come!

03:31.800 --> 03:33.564
Soft, soft, who comes here?

03:33.720 --> 03:35.484
<i>...friends, mine honest neighbors...</i>

03:35.640 --> 03:39.725
Worthy Senator Menenius,
one that has always loved the people.

03:39.880 --> 03:45.046
<i>I tell you, friends, most charitable
care have the patricians of you.</i>

03:45.240 --> 03:47.925
<i>For your wants,
your suffering in this dearth,</i>

03:48.120 --> 03:50.771
<i>you may as well strike
at the heavens with your staves</i>

03:50.920 --> 03:53.321
<i>as lift them against the Roman state.</i>

03:53.480 --> 03:57.485
Suffer us to famish, and their
storehouses crammed with grain.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.404
Bread!

04:59.920 --> 05:03.686
- Bread!
- Bread.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.047
Bread!

05:08.440 --> 05:12.684
Bread, bread, bread...!

05:33.640 --> 05:35.642
Bread, bread, bread...

05:56.680 --> 05:58.523
Stop!

06:00.280 --> 06:02.760
- Stop! Stop!

06:11.320 --> 06:14.210
What's the matter,
you dissentious rogues,

06:14.360 --> 06:18.729
that, rubbing the poor itch of
your opinion, make yourselves scabs?

06:18.880 --> 06:21.281
We have ever your good word.

06:21.480 --> 06:27.044
He that will give good words to thee
will flatter beneath abhorring.

06:27.240 --> 06:31.962
What would you have, you curs,
that like nor peace nor war?

06:32.160 --> 06:35.323
The one affrights you,
the other makes you proud.

06:35.480 --> 06:38.290
He that trusts to you,
where he should find you lions,

06:38.440 --> 06:42.161
finds you hares, where foxes, geese.

06:43.680 --> 06:48.641
Who deserves greatness,
deserves your hate.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.644
Hang ye. Trust ye?

06:52.800 --> 06:55.087
With every minute
you do change your mind,

06:55.240 --> 06:57.402
and call him noble
that was now your hate,

06:57.600 --> 06:59.728
him vile that was your garland.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.963
What's the matter, that in these
several places of the city

07:03.120 --> 07:08.160
you cry against the noble senate,
who, under the gods, keep you in awe,

07:08.360 --> 07:11.204
which else would feed on one another?

07:13.600 --> 07:15.443
Go.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.090
Get you home...

07:18.600 --> 07:21.126
...you fragments.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.569
- Go back!
- Forward!

07:53.520 --> 07:56.000
<i>Go back!</i>

08:45.760 --> 08:48.240
- Please...
- Know you me yet?

08:49.920 --> 08:51.570
I know you well.

08:52.480 --> 08:55.689
Your name, I think, is Aufidius.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.410
It is so.

09:01.080 --> 09:04.801
- I'm a Roman.
- What's the news in Rome?

09:17.720 --> 09:18.881
What's the news in Rome?

09:20.200 --> 09:23.647
There hath been in Rome
strange insurrections.

09:24.840 --> 09:29.926
- The people against the senators.
- Hath been? Is it ended then?

09:30.080 --> 09:32.401
The main blaze of it is past,

09:32.560 --> 09:35.404
but a small thing
would make it flame again.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.244
<i>You have ended my business.</i>

09:47.960 --> 09:51.009
The news is the Volsces are in arms.

09:51.160 --> 09:55.529
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius,
that'll put you to it.

09:55.680 --> 09:59.480
I sin in envying his nobility.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.723
And were I anything but what I am,
I would wish me only he.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.086
You have fought together?

10:06.080 --> 10:09.163
He is a lion that I am proud to hunt.

10:10.960 --> 10:15.682
Titus Lartius, thou shalt see me
once more strike at Tullus' face.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.086
Lead you on.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.969
So your opinion is, Aufidius,

10:37.120 --> 10:39.691
that they of Rome
are entered in our counsels

10:39.840 --> 10:42.411
- and know how we proceed.
- Is it not yours?

10:42.560 --> 10:45.245
'Tis not four days gone
since I heard thence.

10:46.040 --> 10:49.283
By the discovery,
we shall be shortened in our aim.

10:49.440 --> 10:53.650
And it is rumored Martius, your
old enemy, leads on this preparation.

10:53.800 --> 10:57.282
If we and Caius Martius
chance to meet, 'tis sworn between us

10:57.440 --> 11:00.444
we shall ever strike
till one can do no more.

11:01.320 --> 11:04.608
If ever again I meet him beard to beard,

11:04.760 --> 11:07.923
he's mine or I am his.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.645
Mark me!

11:51.800 --> 11:54.280
They do disdain us much
beyond our thoughts.

11:54.480 --> 11:58.166
He that retires, I'll take him for
a Volsce and he shall feel mine edge!

11:58.600 --> 11:59.761
Go!

12:42.800 --> 12:43.961
Come on.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.206
Away!

13:25.440 --> 13:27.408
<i>The citizens
of Corioles have issued</i>

13:27.560 --> 13:29.528
<i>and given to Titus
and to Martius battle.</i>

13:29.680 --> 13:32.843
<i>We've heard their drums.
I saw our forces to their trenches</i>

13:33.040 --> 13:34.769
<i>- driven, and then I came away...</i>

13:37.600 --> 13:42.083
I pray you, daughter, sing,

13:42.240 --> 13:45.050
or express yourself
in a more comfortable sort.

13:47.280 --> 13:50.011
If my son were my husband,

13:50.160 --> 13:54.404
I would more freely
rejoice in that absence

13:54.600 --> 13:58.161
wherein he won honor
than in the embracements of his bed

13:58.320 --> 14:00.049
where he would show most love.

14:00.200 --> 14:04.683
When yet he was but tender-bodied
and the only son of my womb,

14:04.840 --> 14:09.687
I, considering how honor
would become such a person,

14:09.840 --> 14:15.244
was pleased to let him seek danger,
where he was like to find fame.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.126
To a cruel war I sent him,

14:19.280 --> 14:23.080
from whence he returned,
his brows bound with oak.

14:23.240 --> 14:26.369
But had he died in the business,
madam, how then?

14:26.520 --> 14:27.760
Then...

14:29.720 --> 14:32.803
...his good report
should have been my son.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.649
Hear me.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.604
Had I a dozen sons,

14:41.760 --> 14:47.403
I had rather eleven die
nobly for their country,

14:47.560 --> 14:50.450
than one voluptuously
surfeit out of action.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.967
Heavens bless my lord
from fell Aufidius.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.562
He'll beat Aufidius' head
below his knee and tread upon his neck.

14:58.040 --> 15:03.444
Methinks I hear hither
your husband's drum.

15:06.400 --> 15:12.123
<i>I see him stamp thus,</i>

15:12.280 --> 15:14.328
<i>cry thus:</i>

15:14.480 --> 15:18.690
<i>"Come on, you cowards!</i>

15:18.840 --> 15:22.765
<i>You were got in fear,
though you were born in Rome. "</i>

15:26.880 --> 15:32.046
You souls of geese
that bear the shapes of men!

15:32.240 --> 15:35.801
Pluto and hell.
Look to it. Come on!

15:37.600 --> 15:40.888
Mend and charge home,

15:41.080 --> 15:46.371
or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave
the foe and make my wars on you.

15:57.440 --> 16:00.444
His bloody brow then wiping,
forth he goes.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.086
His bloody brow?
O Jupiter, no blood.

16:03.240 --> 16:05.720
Away, you fool.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.770
It more becomes a man
than gold his trophy.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.729
Senator Menenius is come to visit you.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.928
Tell him we are fit to bid him welcome.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.367
Beseech you,
give me leave to retire myself.

16:15.520 --> 16:20.560
- Indeed, you shall not.
- My ladies both, good day to you.

16:23.080 --> 16:26.687
How do you both?
And how does your little son?

16:26.880 --> 16:28.325
I thank you, sir. Well, good.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.642
He'd rather play
with swords and hear a drum

16:30.840 --> 16:33.730
- than look upon his schoolmaster.
- On my word, the father's son.

16:35.680 --> 16:39.765
Come, I must have you play the idle
housewife with me this afternoon.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.684
No, good sir, I will not out of doors.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.888
- Not out of doors?
- She shall, she shall.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.963
Indeed, no, by your patience.

16:46.120 --> 16:49.010
I'll not over the threshold
till my lord return from the wars.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.640
Fie, you confine yourself
most unreasonably.

16:51.800 --> 16:55.725
- I cannot go hither.
- O you would be another Penelope.

16:55.880 --> 16:59.441
Yet they say, all the yarn she spun
in Ulysses' absence

16:59.600 --> 17:01.602
did but fill Ithaca full of moths.

17:03.240 --> 17:07.689
No, good sir. Pardon me.
Indeed, I will not forth.

17:07.880 --> 17:11.406
Go with me, and I'll tell you
excellent news of your husband.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.800
No, good sir,
there can be none yet.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.769
- There came news from him last night.
- Indeed?

17:15.920 --> 17:19.845
Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down
before the Volscian city of Carioles.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.971
They nothing doubt prevailing,
and to make it brief wars.

17:24.119 --> 17:28.808
This is true, on mine honor.
So, I pray, go outwith us.

17:28.960 --> 17:33.090
Give me excuse, good sir.
I will obey you in everything hereafter.

17:33.280 --> 17:36.966
Let her alone. As she is now,
she will but disease our better mirth.

19:30.680 --> 19:35.163
What is become of Martius?
- Slain, sir, doubtless.

19:35.360 --> 19:38.762
He is himself alone,
to answer all the city.

19:40.160 --> 19:43.926
Thou art lost, Martius.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.843
Who's yonder,
that does appear as he were flayed?

20:08.160 --> 20:11.323
O gods! He has the stamp of Martius.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.010
Come I too late?!

20:15.200 --> 20:16.804
Come I too late?!

20:16.960 --> 20:19.611
Aye, if you come not in the blood
of others, but mantled in your own.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.766
Let me hold you in arms
as sound as when I wooed,

20:25.920 --> 20:28.764
in heart as merry as when
our nuptial day was done.

20:30.120 --> 20:34.125
There is the man of my soul's hate.
Aufidius, piercing our Romans.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.044
Worthy sir, thou bleeds.

20:36.200 --> 20:39.010
Thy exercise has been too violent
for a second course of fight.

20:39.160 --> 20:42.050
Sir, praise me not.
My work hath not yet warmed me.

20:42.200 --> 20:45.488
The blood I drop is more
medicinal than dangerous to me.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.365
To Aufidius thus
I will appear and fight.

20:50.560 --> 20:54.121
If any such be here,
as it were sin to doubt,

20:54.280 --> 20:56.886
that love this painting
wherein you see me smeared,

20:57.040 --> 21:00.089
if any fear lesser his person
than an ill report,

21:00.240 --> 21:03.562
if any think brave death
outweighs bad life,

21:03.720 --> 21:05.927
and that his country
is dearer than himself,

21:06.080 --> 21:09.880
let him alone, or so many so minded

21:10.080 --> 21:14.324
wave thus, to express his disposition,
and follow Martius!

21:17.560 --> 21:21.929
O... me alone.

21:29.440 --> 21:32.967
Make you a sword of me!

21:52.400 --> 21:53.401
Oi!

21:55.440 --> 21:57.124
Advance, brave Titus!

22:07.960 --> 22:09.291
Away!

22:24.960 --> 22:26.530
Come! Come!

22:58.320 --> 23:03.565
I'll fight with none but thee,
for I do hate thee.

23:03.720 --> 23:05.848
We hate alike.

26:30.560 --> 26:34.849
Five times, Martius,
I have fought with thee.

26:36.280 --> 26:40.490
So often has thou beat me,
and would do so, I fear,

26:40.640 --> 26:43.689
should we encounter as often as we eat.

26:44.920 --> 26:48.970
For where I thought to crush him
in an equal force,

26:49.120 --> 26:53.682
true sword to sword,
I'll potch at him some way.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.645
Or wrath or craft may get him.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.729
He's the devil.

26:58.880 --> 27:02.851
Bolder, though not so subtle.

27:05.880 --> 27:11.728
Nor sleep, nor sanctuary,
being naked, sick,

27:11.880 --> 27:14.804
the prayers of priests,
nor times of sacrifice

27:14.960 --> 27:17.566
shall lift up their rotten
privilege and custom

27:17.720 --> 27:20.041
against my hate to Martius.

27:23.040 --> 27:27.489
Where I find him, were it at home,

27:27.640 --> 27:30.644
upon my brother's guard,

27:30.800 --> 27:36.409
even there, will I wash
my fierce hand in his heart.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.364
Honorable Menenius!

27:42.080 --> 27:44.162
My boy, Martius, approaches.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.288
For the love of Juno, let's go.

27:46.440 --> 27:48.886
Is he not wounded?
He was wont to come home wounded.

27:49.040 --> 27:51.884
O yes, he is wounded.
I thank the gods for it.

27:52.040 --> 27:55.044
O, so do I too,
if it be not too much.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.202
Brings a victory in his pocket,
the wounds become him.

27:57.400 --> 27:59.641
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?

27:59.800 --> 28:02.804
Titus Lartius said they fought together,
but Aufidius got off.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.201
In truth, there's wondrous
things spoke of him.

28:05.360 --> 28:06.646
Gods grant them true.

28:06.800 --> 28:09.167
- True.
- I'll be sworn they're true.

28:09.320 --> 28:10.401
Where is he wounded?

28:10.560 --> 28:12.528
In the shoulder and in the left arm.

28:12.680 --> 28:14.603
There will be large
scars to show the people

28:14.760 --> 28:16.569
when he shall stand for his place.

28:16.720 --> 28:18.449
He had, before this last expedition,

28:18.600 --> 28:22.161
- 25 wounds upon him.
- Now it's 27.

28:24.720 --> 28:27.166
Every gash was an enemy's grave.

28:50.440 --> 28:55.924
Before him he carries noise,
and behind him he leaves tears.

28:56.080 --> 29:01.689
Death, that dark spirit,
in his nervy arm doth lie.

29:01.880 --> 29:06.408
Which, being advanced,
declines, and then men die.

29:16.480 --> 29:19.131
Be it known,
as to us, to all the world,

29:19.280 --> 29:21.760
that Caius Martius
wears this war's garland.

29:21.920 --> 29:25.686
And, from this time,
for what he did before Corioles,

29:25.840 --> 29:30.164
call him, with all the applause
and clamor of the host:

29:30.320 --> 29:36.202
"Caius Martius Coriolanus."
Bear the addition nobly ever.

29:37.640 --> 29:40.962
Caius Martius Coriolanus!

29:50.960 --> 29:54.009
No more of this. It does offend
my heart. Pray now, no more.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.367
Look, sir, your mother.

30:02.000 --> 30:07.040
O, you have, I know, petitioned
all the gods for my prosperity.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.402
Nay, my good soldier, up.

30:09.560 --> 30:13.849
Ah, my gentle Martius, worthy Caius,

30:14.040 --> 30:19.604
and by deed-achieving honor
newly named... What is it?

30:19.760 --> 30:22.445
"Coriolanus" must I call thee?

30:24.040 --> 30:26.088
But, O, thy wife...

30:28.520 --> 30:32.605
My gracious silence, hail.

30:36.280 --> 30:38.601
Wouldst thou have laughed
had I come coffined home,

30:38.760 --> 30:40.603
that weeps to see me triumph?

30:42.160 --> 30:46.370
Aye, my dear, such eyes
the widows in Corioles wear,

30:46.520 --> 30:49.888
and mothers that lack sons.

30:53.040 --> 30:56.567
Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?

30:56.720 --> 31:00.122
I could weep and I could laugh.
I'm light and heavy.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.328
- I know not where to turn.

31:02.480 --> 31:05.643
O, you are welcome home.
You are welcome all.

31:05.840 --> 31:09.049
- A hundred thousand welcomes!
- Welcome all!

31:09.200 --> 31:11.601
- Welcome, Coriolanus!

31:11.800 --> 31:13.450
Welcome!

31:27.160 --> 31:29.640
<i>'Tis thought that
Martius shall be consul.</i>

31:29.800 --> 31:31.529
<i>I have seen the dumb men
throng to see him,</i>

31:31.680 --> 31:33.284
<i>and the blind to hear him speak.</i>

31:33.440 --> 31:36.171
<i>Matrons flung gloves,
ladies and maids their scarves</i>

31:36.320 --> 31:37.890
<i>and handkerchiefs
upon him as he passed.</i>

31:38.080 --> 31:40.242
<i>The nobles bended as to Jove's statue.</i>

31:40.400 --> 31:43.324
<i>And the commons made a shower
and thunder with their caps and shouts.</i>

31:43.480 --> 31:45.005
<i>I never saw the like.</i>

31:45.880 --> 31:48.884
Was ever a man
so proud as is this Martius?

31:49.040 --> 31:50.485
He has no equal.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.324
When we were chosen tribunes
for the people...

31:52.480 --> 31:55.802
- Marked you his lip and eyes?
- Nay, but his taunts.

31:55.960 --> 31:58.964
The augurer tells me
we shall have news tonight.

31:59.640 --> 32:01.051
Good or bad?

32:01.200 --> 32:04.807
Not according to the prayer of
the people, for they love not Martius.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.645
Nature teaches beasts
to know their friends.

32:14.160 --> 32:16.003
You blame Martius for being proud?

32:16.960 --> 32:21.522
- We do it not alone, sir.
- I know you can do very little alone.

32:25.240 --> 32:26.730
You talk of pride.

32:28.320 --> 32:30.971
O that you could turn your eyes
towards the napes of your necks

32:31.120 --> 32:33.771
and make but an interior
survey of your good selves.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.571
- O that you could.
- What then, sir?

32:36.760 --> 32:40.810
Why, then you should discover
a brace of unmeriting, proud,

32:40.960 --> 32:46.922
violent, testy politicians,
alias fools, as any in Rome.

32:47.080 --> 32:51.324
Menenius, you are known
well enough too.

32:52.120 --> 32:54.487
I am known to be a humorous patrician,

32:54.640 --> 32:58.440
and one that loves a cup of hot wine
with not a drop of allaying water in it.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.887
One that converses more
with the buttock of the night

33:01.080 --> 33:02.764
than with the forehead of the morning.

33:02.920 --> 33:07.164
What I think I utter,
and spend my malice in my breath.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.243
Come, sir, come,
we know you well enough.

33:09.400 --> 33:13.803
You know neither me,
yourselves, nor anything.

33:17.400 --> 33:20.643
- You're ambitious.

33:23.240 --> 33:25.242
Good e'en to your worships.

33:25.800 --> 33:28.610
More of your conversation
would infect my brain.

33:28.760 --> 33:31.843
- How many stand for the consulship?
- Three, they say,

33:32.000 --> 33:34.287
but 'tis thought of everyone
Coriolanus will carry it.

33:34.440 --> 33:37.205
That's a brave fellow,
but he is vengeance proud

33:37.360 --> 33:38.691
and loves not the common people.

33:38.840 --> 33:40.683
There have been many great men
that have flattered the people

33:40.840 --> 33:42.080
who never loved them.

33:42.240 --> 33:45.050
Therefore, for Coriolanus, neither
to care whether they love or hate him

33:45.200 --> 33:48.010
manifests the true knowledge
he has in their disposition.

33:48.160 --> 33:51.323
And, out of his noble carelessness,
lets them plainly see it.

33:51.480 --> 33:55.007
But he seeks their hate with greater
devotion than they can render at him.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.811
Now to seem to desire the malice
and displeasure of the people

33:57.960 --> 34:00.964
is as bad as that which he dislikes,
to flatter them for their love.

34:01.120 --> 34:03.202
Consider you what services
he has done for his country?

34:03.360 --> 34:06.091
Very well. And would be content
to give him good report for it,

34:06.240 --> 34:08.481
but that he pays
himself with being proud.

34:08.639 --> 34:11.768
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
He hath deserve worthily of his country.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.563
The good senators must be visited,

34:40.760 --> 34:42.842
from whom I have received
not only greetings,

34:43.000 --> 34:45.241
but with them change of honors.

34:47.639 --> 34:53.090
I have lived to see inherited
my very wishes

34:53.239 --> 34:56.369
and the buildings of my fancy.

34:56.520 --> 34:59.091
Only there's one thing wanting,

34:59.280 --> 35:05.890
which I doubt not
but our Rome will cast upon thee.

35:06.080 --> 35:10.483
Good mother, I'd rather
be their servant in my way,

35:10.640 --> 35:12.369
than sway with them in theirs.

37:09.440 --> 37:11.124
Coriolanus will carry it.

37:11.280 --> 37:12.930
He's a worthy man. He will carry it.

37:18.800 --> 37:22.771
- All tongues speak of him.
- On the sudden, I warrant him consul.

37:22.920 --> 37:25.890
Then our office may,
during his power, go asleep.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.082
He cannot temperately
transport his honors

37:29.240 --> 37:32.289
from where he should begin and end,
but will lose those he hath won.

37:32.440 --> 37:35.091
I heard him swear,
were he to stand for consul,

37:35.240 --> 37:36.651
never would he appear
in the marketplace,

37:36.800 --> 37:39.007
nor showing, as the manner is,
his wounds to the people,

37:39.160 --> 37:41.003
beg their stinking breaths.

37:41.160 --> 37:44.482
It was his word. It shall be to him
then, a sure destruction.

37:44.640 --> 37:48.486
So it must fall out to him,
or our authorities, for an end.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.487
We must suggest to the people

37:52.640 --> 37:55.120
in what hatred
he still hath held them.

37:55.680 --> 37:57.682
Kindle their dry stubble,

37:57.840 --> 38:00.366
and their blaze
shall darken him forever.

38:06.160 --> 38:08.401
It remains, as the main point
of this our after-meeting,

38:08.560 --> 38:12.963
to gratify his noble service
that hath thus stood for his country.

38:13.120 --> 38:16.283
Therefore, please you,
most grave and reverend elders,

38:16.480 --> 38:20.201
to desire the present consul, and last
general in our well-found successes,

38:20.400 --> 38:26.248
to report a little of that worthy work
performed by Caius Martius Coriolanus.

38:26.400 --> 38:29.085
- Speak, good Cominius.
- Aye.

38:32.680 --> 38:35.411
- Nay, keep your place.
- Sit, Coriolanus.

38:35.560 --> 38:37.881
Never shame to hear
what you have nobly done.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.004
Your honor's pardon. I'd rather
have my wounds to heal again

38:41.160 --> 38:44.607
- than hear say how I got them.
- Pray you, sit down.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.768
I'd rather have one
scratch my head in the sun

38:46.920 --> 38:48.081
when the alarm were struck

38:48.240 --> 38:52.370
than idly sit to hear
my nothings monstered.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.647
- Speak, good Cominius.
- Aye, proceed.

39:04.800 --> 39:09.010
The deeds of Coriolanus
should not be uttered feebly.

39:09.200 --> 39:12.602
It is held that valor
is the chiefest virtue,

39:12.760 --> 39:14.364
and most dignifies the haver.

39:14.520 --> 39:17.649
If it be, the man I speak of

39:17.800 --> 39:20.644
cannot in the world
be singly counterpoised.

39:21.480 --> 39:25.485
At 16 years,
he fought beyond the mark of others.

39:25.640 --> 39:28.041
When he might act
the woman in the scene,

39:28.200 --> 39:30.965
he proved best man in the field.

39:31.120 --> 39:33.361
And in the brunt of 17 battles since,

39:33.520 --> 39:36.251
he lurched all swords of the garland.

39:36.400 --> 39:39.643
<i>For this last, before and in Corioles,</i>

39:39.800 --> 39:42.883
<i>let me say I cannot speak him home.</i>

39:43.280 --> 39:46.489
<i>He stopped the fliers,
and by his rare example,</i>

39:46.640 --> 39:51.567
<i>made coward turn terror into sport,
from face to foot.</i>

39:51.720 --> 39:56.806
<i>He was a thing of blood, whose every
motion was timed with dying cries.</i>

39:56.960 --> 40:00.806
Alone, he entered
the mortal gate of the city,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.162
which he painted with shunless destiny.

40:03.320 --> 40:05.243
- Aidless came off,

40:05.400 --> 40:07.164
and with a sudden re-enforcement

40:07.320 --> 40:11.120
struck Corioles like a planet.

40:11.640 --> 40:14.166
Until we called
both field and city ours,

40:14.320 --> 40:17.563
he never stood to ease
his breast with panting.

40:17.720 --> 40:22.681
Our spoils he kicked at,
and looked upon things precious

40:22.840 --> 40:25.081
as they were the common
muck of the world.

40:25.240 --> 40:29.086
He covets less
than misery itself would give,

40:29.280 --> 40:31.521
rewards his deeds with doing them,

40:31.680 --> 40:35.969
and is content to spend
the time to end it.

40:46.720 --> 40:50.611
The senate, Coriolanus,
are well pleased to make thee consul.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.404
Aye.

40:56.880 --> 41:00.771
I do owe them still
my life and services.

41:00.920 --> 41:04.322
It then remains
that you do speak to the people.

41:06.880 --> 41:09.167
I do beseech you,
let me overleap that custom,

41:09.360 --> 41:14.048
for I cannot entreat them for my wounds'
sake to give their suffrage.

41:14.240 --> 41:16.208
Please you that I may pass this doing.

41:16.360 --> 41:20.604
Sir! The people must have their voices.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.364
Pray you, go fit you to the custom.

41:22.520 --> 41:25.091
It is a part that I shall blush
in acting, and might well be taken

41:25.240 --> 41:26.810
- from the people.
- Mark you that?

41:27.000 --> 41:29.241
To brag unto them
"Thus I did, and thus!"

41:29.400 --> 41:32.324
Show them the unaching scars
which I should hide,

41:32.480 --> 41:35.450
as if I had received them
for the hire of their breath only.

41:40.440 --> 41:44.047
To our noble consul
wish we all joy and honor!

42:12.360 --> 42:16.729
<i>The senate, Coriolanus, are
well pleased to make thee consul!</i>

42:16.880 --> 42:19.406
<i>I do owe them still
my life and services.</i>

42:19.560 --> 42:21.881
<i>It then remains that
you do speak to the people.</i>

42:22.040 --> 42:23.371
<i>Let me overleap that custom.</i>

42:23.560 --> 42:25.289
<i>The people must have their voices.</i>

42:25.640 --> 42:27.961
Have you not known
the worthiest men have done it?

42:28.120 --> 42:29.531
Custom calls me to it.

42:29.680 --> 42:32.968
What custom wills,
in all things should we do it.

42:33.120 --> 42:34.610
What must I say?

42:34.760 --> 42:37.570
"Look, sir, my wounds.
I got them in my country's service."

42:37.720 --> 42:40.883
O me, the gods!
You must not speak like that.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.485
You must desire them to think upon you.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.768
Think upon me?

42:44.920 --> 42:47.127
Hang 'em.
I would they would forget me.

43:05.560 --> 43:07.688
Pray you, speak to them.

43:07.840 --> 43:10.241
I pray you, in wholesome manner.

43:10.440 --> 43:13.410
Bid them wash their faces
and keep their teeth clean.

43:47.720 --> 43:50.166
You know the cause, sir,
of my standing here?

43:50.320 --> 43:53.130
We do, sir. Tell us
what hath brought you to it.

43:53.280 --> 43:56.363
- Mine own desert.
- Your own desert?

43:56.520 --> 44:01.321
- Aye, but not mine own desire.
- How not your own desire?

44:01.480 --> 44:04.927
No, it was never my desire
yet to trouble the poor with begging.

44:05.120 --> 44:08.602
You must think, if we give you anything,
we hope to gain by you.

44:10.480 --> 44:12.687
Well then, I pray,
your price of the consulship?

44:13.920 --> 44:16.571
The price is to ask it kindly.

44:16.720 --> 44:19.803
Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it.

44:21.080 --> 44:25.768
I have wounds to show you,
which shall be yours in private.

44:27.040 --> 44:28.769
Your good voice, sir. What say you?

44:29.880 --> 44:34.841
- You shall have it, worthy sir.
- A match, sir.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.924
There's in all two
worthy voices begged. Adieu.

44:39.920 --> 44:41.331
But this is something odd.

44:43.800 --> 44:46.451
Pray you now, if it may stand
with the tune of your voice

44:46.600 --> 44:48.728
that I may be consul.

44:48.880 --> 44:52.282
You've deserved nobly of your country,
and you've not deserved nobly.

44:53.400 --> 44:54.925
Your enigma?

44:55.080 --> 44:59.005
You've been a scourge to her enemies,
you've been a rod to her friends.

44:59.160 --> 45:01.447
You've not indeed loved
the common people.

45:02.280 --> 45:06.080
You should account me the more virtuous
that I have not been common in my love.

45:06.240 --> 45:08.288
We hope to find you our friend,

45:08.440 --> 45:10.602
and therefore give you
our voices heartily.

45:11.120 --> 45:13.691
I'll make much of your voices,
and so trouble you no further.

45:13.840 --> 45:16.889
Gods give you joy, sir, heartily.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.206
Your voices!

45:38.720 --> 45:42.202
For your voices I have fought.

45:44.320 --> 45:47.244
Watched for your voices.

45:49.160 --> 45:52.721
For your voices
bear of wounds two dozen odd.

45:54.800 --> 45:59.089
Battles thrice six
I have seen and heard of!

46:00.360 --> 46:05.764
For your voices have done many things,
some less, some more.

46:07.800 --> 46:09.962
Your voices!

46:11.840 --> 46:16.687
Indeed, I would be consul.

46:21.760 --> 46:27.290
He has done nobly, and cannot go
without any honest man's voice!

46:27.440 --> 46:30.011
- Aye.
- Aye.

46:30.440 --> 46:33.922
Therefore, let him be consul!

46:34.080 --> 46:36.890
- Amen!
- Amen!

46:37.040 --> 46:39.566
Amen!

46:44.960 --> 46:46.371
Amen!

46:51.560 --> 46:53.847
- Amen!

46:55.280 --> 46:57.567
- Worthy voices!

46:57.720 --> 47:00.200
Worthy voices, worthy voices.

47:07.840 --> 47:09.842
You have stood your limitation.

47:10.840 --> 47:14.561
And the tribunes now endow you
with the people's voice.

47:14.720 --> 47:16.290
Is this done?

47:16.440 --> 47:19.091
The custom of request
you have discharged.

47:19.240 --> 47:20.810
The people do admit you,

47:20.960 --> 47:23.406
and are summoned to meet anon
upon your approbation.

47:23.560 --> 47:25.449
- Where? At the senate?
- There, Coriolanus.

47:25.600 --> 47:28.490
- May I change these garments?
- You may, sir.

47:32.840 --> 47:35.525
I'll keep you company. Will you along?

47:35.680 --> 47:38.160
We stay here for the people.

47:39.640 --> 47:41.927
God save thee, noble consul!

47:43.880 --> 47:48.363
Consul! Consul!
Consul! Consul! Consul! Consul!

47:53.000 --> 47:54.604
How now, my masters!

47:54.760 --> 47:57.366
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

47:57.560 --> 48:03.408
Whoa, my masters! My masters!
My masters, how now!

48:03.560 --> 48:07.246
- Have you chose this man?
- Aye!

48:07.440 --> 48:08.965
He has our voices, sir.

48:09.120 --> 48:11.487
We pray the gods
he may deserve your loves.

48:11.640 --> 48:12.801
Amen, sir.

48:12.960 --> 48:17.648
To my poor, unworthy notice,
he mocked us when he begged our voices.

48:17.800 --> 48:20.167
- He mocked us!
- Flouted us downright.

48:20.320 --> 48:24.006
O, no, no, no,
it is his kind of speech.

48:24.160 --> 48:25.969
Aye.
- He did not mock us.

48:26.120 --> 48:28.441
He should have showed us
his marks of merit,

48:28.600 --> 48:31.444
- wounds received for his country.
Yes!

48:31.600 --> 48:34.524
- Why, I'm sure, so he did.
- No, he didn't!

48:34.720 --> 48:38.850
No, no, no! No! No!
No one saw them!

48:44.760 --> 48:46.171
Was this mockery?

48:47.120 --> 48:48.770
Yes!

48:54.080 --> 48:57.971
When he had no power, but was a petty
servant to the state, he was your enemy.

48:58.160 --> 49:01.801
- Ever spake against your liberties.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.083
Did you perceive he did solicit
you in free contempt

49:05.240 --> 49:09.529
when he did need your loves,
and do you think that his contempt

49:09.680 --> 49:12.570
shall not be bruising to you
when he hath power to crush?

49:12.760 --> 49:15.411
Aye!

49:15.560 --> 49:18.325
It is not confirmed.

49:18.480 --> 49:21.882
It is not confirmed!
We may deny him yet!

49:22.040 --> 49:24.611
- And will deny him!

49:24.760 --> 49:27.843
I'll have 500 voices of that sound.

49:28.000 --> 49:32.164
Yes!
- I twice 500 and their friends!

49:32.360 --> 49:34.044
Yes!

49:34.960 --> 49:37.042
Get you hence instantly
and tell those friends

49:37.240 --> 49:40.449
they have chose a consul that will
from them take their liberties!

49:40.600 --> 49:42.728
Let them assemble,
and on a safer judgment,

49:42.880 --> 49:44.644
all revoke your ignorant election.

49:44.800 --> 49:47.485
Enforce his pride,
and his old hate unto you!

49:47.640 --> 49:51.201
And, presently, when you have drawn
the number, repair to the senate.

49:57.320 --> 49:59.561
Tullus Aufidius then
has assembled a new army?

49:59.760 --> 50:00.727
<i>He has, my lord.</i>

50:00.880 --> 50:03.008
- Saw you Aufidius?
<i>- He's retired to Antium.</i>

50:03.160 --> 50:05.925
- Spoke he of me?
<i>- He did, my lord.</i>

50:06.080 --> 50:07.491
How? What?

50:07.640 --> 50:09.927
<i>How often he had met you,
sword to sword.</i>

50:10.080 --> 50:13.368
<i>That of all things upon the earth,
he hated your person most.</i>

50:13.520 --> 50:16.444
- At Antium lives he?
<i>- At Antium.</i>

50:16.600 --> 50:19.809
I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
to oppose his hatred fully.

50:19.960 --> 50:22.770
Come, Rome must know
the value of her own.

50:33.080 --> 50:34.969
Behold, these are the tribunes
of the people,

50:35.120 --> 50:36.770
the tongues of the common mouth.

50:37.840 --> 50:39.365
- Pass no further.
- Ah? What is that?

50:39.520 --> 50:41.363
It will be dangerous to go on.
No further.

50:41.520 --> 50:43.284
- What makes this change?
- The matter?

50:43.440 --> 50:46.125
Hath he not passed
the nobles and the commons?

50:46.280 --> 50:48.601
- Cominius, no.
- Have I had children's voices?

50:48.760 --> 50:51.525
- Tribunes, give away.
- The people are incensed against him.

50:51.680 --> 50:54.968
- Are these your herd?
- Be calm, be calm.

50:55.120 --> 50:58.681
The people cry you mocked them,
and of late called them time-pleasers,

50:58.840 --> 51:01.730
- flatterers, foes to nobleness.
- Why, this was known before.

51:01.880 --> 51:04.121
You show too much of that
for which the people stir.

51:04.280 --> 51:05.566
If you will pass to where you are bound,

51:05.720 --> 51:07.722
you must inquire your way
with a gentler spirit.

51:07.880 --> 51:11.407
- Let's be calm.
- The people are abused, set on.

51:11.560 --> 51:13.164
This was my speech,
and I'll speak it again.

51:13.320 --> 51:17.006
- Not now, not now.
- Not in this heat, sir.

51:17.160 --> 51:20.050
My nobler friends,
I crave their pardons.

51:20.200 --> 51:24.205
For the mutable, rank-scented many,
let them regard me as I do not flatter,

51:24.360 --> 51:26.124
and therein behold themselves.

51:26.280 --> 51:30.842
I say again, in soothing them,
we nourish against our senate

51:31.000 --> 51:33.810
the cockle of rebellion,
insolence, sedition,

51:33.960 --> 51:37.089
which we ourselves have ploughed for,
sowed, and scattered

51:37.280 --> 51:39.169
by mingling them with us,

51:39.360 --> 51:42.170
the honored number
who lack not virtue, no, nor power,

51:42.320 --> 51:43.765
but that which we have given to beggars!

51:43.920 --> 51:46.526
- Well, no more!
- No more words, we beseech you.

51:46.680 --> 51:49.411
You speak of the people
as if you were a god to punish,

51:49.560 --> 51:51.005
not a man of their infirmity.

51:51.160 --> 51:52.366
It were well we let the people know it.

51:52.520 --> 51:55.251
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
by Jove, it would be my mind!

51:55.400 --> 51:59.246
It is a mind that shall remain a poison
where it is, not poison any further.

51:59.400 --> 52:02.244
Shall remain.
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?

52:02.400 --> 52:04.641
Mark you his absolute "shall"?

52:04.800 --> 52:06.723
Why should the people give one
that speaks thus their voice?

52:06.880 --> 52:10.885
I'll give my reasons,
more worthier than their voices!

52:12.560 --> 52:17.009
By Jove himself,
it makes the consuls base,

52:17.160 --> 52:19.640
and my soul aches to know,

52:19.800 --> 52:23.521
when two authorities are up,
neither supreme,

52:23.680 --> 52:26.524
how soon confusion
may enter twixt the gap of both

52:26.680 --> 52:28.250
and take the one by the other.

52:28.400 --> 52:31.131
Thus we debase
the nature of our seats

52:31.280 --> 52:35.001
and make the rabble call our cares
fears, which will, in time,

52:35.160 --> 52:36.969
break open the locks of the senate,

52:37.120 --> 52:39.441
and bring in the crows
to peck the eagles!

52:39.600 --> 52:42.001
- Come, enough!
- Enough, with over-measure.

52:42.160 --> 52:45.403
He has spoken like a traitor,
and shall answer as traitors do!

52:45.560 --> 52:47.847
Thou wretch,
despite overwhelm thee!

52:48.000 --> 52:50.890
- Manifest treason!
- This is a consul? No!

52:51.040 --> 52:52.644
Seize him!

52:52.800 --> 52:55.201
Hence, old goat!

53:00.040 --> 53:02.088
On both sides more respect!

53:07.040 --> 53:08.610
Shh! Shh!

53:08.760 --> 53:13.402
Here's he that would
take from you all your power!

53:13.560 --> 53:17.451
You are at point to lose your liberties!

53:17.600 --> 53:20.331
Martius would have all from you,

53:20.480 --> 53:24.121
Martius, whom late
you have named for consul.

53:27.120 --> 53:31.011
- What is the city but the people?!
- True!

53:31.160 --> 53:35.848
The people are the city!
The people are the city!

53:41.480 --> 53:44.529
We do here pronounce,
upon the part of the people,

53:44.680 --> 53:47.889
Martius is worthy of present death!

53:50.680 --> 53:53.160
Death!

53:53.320 --> 53:58.121
- Guards, seize him!
- No, I'll die here!

54:02.960 --> 54:06.089
Get you to your house! Be gone, away!

54:06.240 --> 54:09.881
- All will be naught else!
- Come, sir, along with us!

55:16.600 --> 55:21.322
As I do know the consul's worthiness,
so can I name his faults.

55:21.480 --> 55:23.244
Consul? What consul?

55:23.400 --> 55:26.210
- The Consul Coriolanus.
- He, consul?

55:26.360 --> 55:29.011
It is decreed he dies tonight.

55:29.160 --> 55:31.322
He's a disease that must be cut away.

55:31.480 --> 55:34.404
O, he's a limb that hath but a disease.

55:35.800 --> 55:38.724
Mortal, to cut it off,
to cure it, easy.

55:41.200 --> 55:43.362
What has he done to Rome
that's worth his death, eh?

55:46.520 --> 55:48.443
Killing our enemies?

55:52.480 --> 55:56.007
The blood he hath lost,
he dropped it for his country.

55:56.200 --> 55:58.282
- This is clean kam.
- We'll hear no more...

55:58.440 --> 56:00.886
Consider this:

56:01.080 --> 56:05.051
He's been bred in the wars
since he could draw a sword,

56:05.200 --> 56:07.680
and is ill-schooled
in graceful language.

56:09.560 --> 56:13.246
Give me leave. I'll go to him
and undertake to bring him

56:13.400 --> 56:18.247
where he shall answer
by a lawful form, in peace,

56:18.400 --> 56:19.606
to his utmost peril.

56:19.760 --> 56:22.570
Noble tribunes,
it is the humane way.

56:22.720 --> 56:25.724
- Menenius...
- Be you then as the people's officer.

56:27.560 --> 56:32.202
In you bring not Martius,
we'll proceed in our first way.

56:34.840 --> 56:36.842
I'll bring him to you.

56:39.320 --> 56:41.721
Let them pull all about mine ears,

56:41.880 --> 56:44.690
present me death on the wheel
or at wild horses' heels,

56:44.840 --> 56:47.002
- yet will I still be thus to them!
- Martius...

56:47.160 --> 56:50.130
I muse my mother
does not approve me further.

56:50.280 --> 56:53.443
I talk of you.
Why would you wish me milder?

56:54.080 --> 56:56.242
Would you have me false to my nature?

56:57.440 --> 57:00.649
Rather say I play the man I am.

57:07.200 --> 57:12.331
Sir, sir, I would have had
you put your power well on

57:12.480 --> 57:14.323
before you had worn it out.

57:14.480 --> 57:15.970
- Let go.
- You might have been enough

57:16.160 --> 57:18.891
the man you are,
with striving less to be so.

57:19.880 --> 57:21.928
- Let them hang.
- Aye, and burn, too.

57:22.120 --> 57:24.327
Come, come, you've been
too rough, something too rough.

57:24.480 --> 57:26.244
You must return and mend it.

57:26.400 --> 57:29.404
There's no remedy, unless,
by not so doing, our good city

57:29.560 --> 57:31.722
cleave in the midst and perish.

57:32.200 --> 57:35.409
Pray, be counseled.

57:35.560 --> 57:38.962
I have a heart as little apt as yours,

57:39.120 --> 57:44.001
but yet a brain that leads
my use of anger to better vantage.

57:44.160 --> 57:46.128
- Well said, noble woman.
- And what must I do?

57:46.280 --> 57:48.487
- Return to the tribunes.
- What then? What then?

57:48.640 --> 57:52.167
- Repent what you have spoke.
- For them? I cannot do it to the gods.

57:52.360 --> 57:53.725
Must I then do it to them?

57:57.840 --> 58:00.366
You are too absolute.

58:03.240 --> 58:07.325
I've heard you say
that honor and policy,

58:07.480 --> 58:09.801
like unsevered friends in war,
do grow together.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.367
Why force you this?

58:12.520 --> 58:16.525
Because that now it lies
you on to speak to the people,

58:16.720 --> 58:18.848
not by your own instruction,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.367
nor by the matter
your heart prompts you,

58:21.520 --> 58:25.650
but with such words that
are but roted in your tongue,

58:25.800 --> 58:31.250
though but bastards and syllables
of no allowance to your bosom's truth.

58:33.160 --> 58:36.130
I would dissemble
with my nature where my fortune

58:36.320 --> 58:41.690
and my friends at stake required
I should do so in honor.

58:41.840 --> 58:47.370
I am, in this, your wife,
your son, the senators,

58:47.520 --> 58:52.242
nobles... and you.

58:54.880 --> 59:00.728
I prithee now, my son,
go to them, be with them,

59:00.880 --> 59:06.649
say to them thou art their soldier.

59:07.600 --> 59:09.170
And being bred in broils

59:09.320 --> 59:14.121
has not the soft way
in asking their good loves.

59:14.640 --> 59:19.567
But thou wilt frame thyself,

59:19.720 --> 59:22.121
forsooth, hereafter theirs.

59:22.960 --> 59:28.842
This but done, even as she speaks,
why their hearts were yours.

59:29.040 --> 59:31.247
I prithee, go and be ruled.

59:32.760 --> 59:36.401
Sir, it is fit you make strong party,

59:36.560 --> 59:39.166
or defend yourself
by calmness or by absence.

59:39.320 --> 59:42.403
- All's in anger.
- Only fair speech.

59:42.560 --> 59:45.609
I think it will serve
if he can thereto frame his spirit.

59:45.760 --> 59:48.730
He must.

59:50.160 --> 59:52.128
He will.

59:52.280 --> 59:55.489
Prithee now, say you will,
and go about it.

59:55.640 --> 59:59.611
Must I, with base tongue,
give my noble heart

59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.445
a lie that it must bear?

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:06.241
Well, I'll do it.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:12.928
Away, my disposition,
and possess me some harlot's spirit.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:17.244
A beggar's tongue
make motion through my lips.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.611
I will not do it.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.644
Lest I cease to honor mine own truth,

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.247
and by my body's action teach
my mind a most inherent baseness.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.162
At thy choice, then.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.971
To beg of thee is more
my dishonor than thou of them.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.645
Come all to ruin.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:39.687
Let thy mother rather
feel thy pride than fear

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:43.003
thy dangerous stoutness,
for I mock at death

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:47.524
with as big heart as thou.
Do as you like.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:00.967
Thy valiantness was mine,
thou suck'st it from me,

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.327
but owe thy pride thyself.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.529
Pray, be content, Mother, I'm going.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:13.050
Chide me no more. Look, I am going.

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:20.401
I'll return consul, or never
trust to what my tongue can do

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:24.610
- in the way of flattery further.
- Do your will.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:28.683
That he affects tyrannical power.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:32.526
If he evade us there, enforce him
with his hatred to the people.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.205
Have you a catalog of all the voices

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.010
that we have procured
set down by the poll?

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.924
I have. It's ready.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.206
When the people hear me say

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.203
"it shall be so in the right
and strength of the commons,"

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.488
be it either for death, for fine,
or banishment,

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.325
then, let them, if they hear me say
"Fine," cry "Fine."

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:48.847
- If "Death," cry "Death."
- We shall inform them.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:53.844
God preserve thee.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.526
The people are the city.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.882
Put not your worthy rage
into your tongue.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.008
Calmly, I beseech you.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.889
- The honored gods...

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.966
The honored gods
keep Rome in safety,

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.761
and the chairs of justice
supplied with worthy men,

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.129
plant love among us,

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.965
throng our large temples
with the shows of peace,

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.088
and not our streets with war.

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.766
- Amen, amen.
- A noble wish.

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:28.288
Shall I be charged
no further than this present?

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.249
Must all determine here?

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:34.291
I do demand, if you submit
you to the people's voices.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.965
Aye.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:40.449
- I am content.
- Lo, citizens, he says he is content.

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:45.403
The warlike service
he has done, consider.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.403
Think upon the wounds his body bears,

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.325
which show like graves
in the holy churchyard.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.370
Scratches with briers,
scars to move laughter only.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.688
Consider further, that when
he speaks not like a citizen,

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.207
- you find him like a soldier.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:04.490
Do not take his rougher accents
for malicious sounds, but, as I say,

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:08.167
such as become a soldier.

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:12.809
What is the matter that being
passed for consul with full voice,

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.726
I am so dishonored that the very hour
you take it off again?

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.771
We charge you that you have contrived
to take from Rome all seasoned office,

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.009
and to wind yourself
into a power tyrannical,

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.400
for which you are
a traitor to the people.

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.971
How... traitor?

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:29.202
- Traitor!
- Nay, temperately. Your promise.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.886
The fires in the lowest hell
fold in the people.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.805
Call me their traitor,
thou injurious tribune?

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:37.122
- Mark you this, people?
- Yes.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.805
Traitor!

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:42.885
But since he hath
served well for Rome...

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.565
What do you prate of service?

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.927
- I talk of that, that know it.
- You?

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.730
Is this the promise
you made your mother?

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.851
I'll know no further. Let them
pronounce death, exile, flaying,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.641
I would not buy their mercy
at the price of one fair word.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:59.929
In the name of the people,
and in the power of us, the tribunes,

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.249
we, even from this instant,
banish him our city.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:07.564
In the people's name, I say...
it shall be so.

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:13.170
- It shall be so!
- He's banished. It shall be so!

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.881
- It shall be so!

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:20.681
- It shall be so!
- Hear me, my masters,

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.001
and my common friends...

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.811
- He's sentenced. No more hearing.
- Let me speak.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.531
It shall be so!
- I have been consul

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:31.321
and can show for Rome
her enemies' marks upon me...

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:35.007
There is no more to be said,
but he is banished as enemy

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.248
- to the people and his country!
- It shall be so!

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.085
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:43.164
It shall be so!
It shall be so!

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.721
It shall be so! It shall be so!

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:48.321
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.241
It shall be so! It shall be so!

01:05:53.400 --> 01:06:01.400
It shall be so! It shall be so!
It shall be so! It shall be so!

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:08.888
You common cry of curs!

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:14.888
Whose breath I hate
as reeks of the rotten fens,

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:19.489
whose loves I prize
as the dead carcasses

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:24.089
of unburied men
that do corrupt my air.

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:27.449
I... banish... you!

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:33.004
And here remain with your uncertainty.

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.762
Let every feeble rumor
shake your hearts.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.764
Your enemies,
with nodding of their caps,

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.810
fan you into despair.

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:49.444
Have the power still to banish
your defenders, till at length

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:54.003
your ignorance,
which finds not till it feels,

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:57.004
making but reservation of yourselves,

01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:01.449
still your own foes deliver you

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:05.207
as most abated captives to some nation

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:09.081
that won you without blows.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:18.802
Despising, for you, the city...

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.884
thus.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.083
...I turn my back.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:32.331
There is a world... elsewhere.

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:45.926
<i>The people's enemy is gone!</i>

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:04.326
- Whoo!

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.845
<i>Nay, Mother,
where is your ancient courage?</i>

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.085
<i>You are too absolute.</i>

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:30.040
<i>Nay, Mother,
I shall be loved when I am lacked.</i>

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:35.564
<i>I go alone, like to a lonely dragon.</i>

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:52.444
- The gods preserve you both.
- Good day to you all.

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.005
The gods keep you.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.889
This is a happier
and more comely time.

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:58.611
- Yeah.
- Good day. Good day.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.764
- O, here comes his mother.
- Let's not meet her.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.970
- They say she's mad.
- O, you're well met.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:12.807
The hoarded plague of the gods
requite thy love.

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:16.366
- Will you be gone?
- You shall stay, too!

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:19.000
I would I had the power
to say so to my husband.

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.323
- Are you mad?
- Aye, fool, is that a shame?

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:27.088
I tell thee what, fool,
hadst thou craft to banish him

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.881
that struck more blows for Rome
than thou hast spoken words?

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.451
Blessed heavens...

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.804
More noble blows
than ever thou wise words,

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:41.249
and for Rome's good. Yet go.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:45.081
Nay, thou shalt stay, too.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:47.049
I tell thee what.

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:52.240
I would my son were in Arabia,
and thy tribe before him,

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.131
- his good sword in his hand.
- What then?

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.841
What then?
He'd make an end of thy posterity!

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.249
- Bastards and all.
- Come! Come, peace!

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.765
Well, well, we'll leave you.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:08.045
Why stay we to be baited
by one who wants her wits?

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:15.371
I would the gods
had nothing else to do

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.366
but to confirm my curses!

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:27.723
Could I meet them but once a day,

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:32.283
it would unclog my heart
of what lies heavy to it.

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:37.126
You have told them home.
And, by my troth, you have cause.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:41.126
You'll sup with me?

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.442
Anger's my meat.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.321
I sup upon myself...

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.611
...and so shall starve with feeding.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.203
- Come.
- Come, madam.

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.249
Hey.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.368
Aufidius!

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.450
Ah, general.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:44.441
Yes.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.481
Well, well.

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:43.485
Hey, hey!

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.564
Whence comes thou?

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:13.129
Thy name?

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:18.570
Speak, man.
What's thy name?

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:21.644
A name unmusical
to the Volscians' ears,

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.689
and harsh in sound to thine.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:28.004
Say... what's thy name?

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.647
Thou has a grim appearance.

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:35.521
What's thy name?

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:41.841
- Know'st thou me yet?
- I know thee not.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.291
Thy name?

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:49.650
My name is Caius Martius...

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:54.483
...who hath done to thee, particularly,

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:59.601
and to all the Volsces
great hurt and mischief.

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.491
Thereto witness may my surname...

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.480
...Coriolanus.

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.805
Only that name remains.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:13.725
The cruelty and envy of the people

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:17.441
who have all forsook me
hath devoured the rest,

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:22.367
and suffered me by the voice of slaves
to be whooped out of Rome.

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.283
Now this extremity
hath brought me to thy hearth,

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:29.808
not out of hope,
mistake me not, to save my life,

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.328
for if I had feared death,
of all men in the world

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:35.602
I would have avoided thee.

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:40.288
But, in mere spite, to be full quit
of those, my banishers,

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:43.165
stand I before thee here.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:48.242
I will fight against my cankered country

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:51.290
with the spleen of all the under fiends.

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:57.120
But if thou dares not this,

01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:01.285
then I present my throat to thee
and to thy ancient malice,

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:05.604
which not to cut would
show thee but a fool,

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:08.724
since I have ever
followed thee with hate,

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:12.726
and cannot live but to thy shame

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:16.043
unless it be to do thee service.

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:40.922
O Martius...

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.403
Martius...

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.531
Each word thou hast spoke

01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:51.969
hath weeded from my heart
a root of ancient envy.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:02.886
Let me twine mine arms about that body.

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.645
Know thou...

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:18.841
...I loved the maid I married,
never man sighed truer breath.

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:25.687
But that I see thee here,
thou noble thing...

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:31.046
...more dances my rapt heart

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.282
than when I first
my wedded mistress saw

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:35.010
bestride my threshold.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:42.925
Why, thou Mars, I tell thee,
thou hast beat me out 12 several times,

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:49.042
and I have nightly since dreamt
of encounters 'twixt thyself and me.

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:56.483
Worthy Martius,
had we no quarrel else to Rome,

01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:01.168
but that thou art thence banished,
we would muster all from 12 to 70,

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:03.971
and, pouring war into
the bowels of ungrateful Rome,

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:07.044
like a bold flood, overbear it.

01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:02.366
Come, go in, and take our
friendly senators by the hands.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:06.246
You bless me, gods.

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:36.847
Therefore, most absolute sir...

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:41.210
...if thou wilt have the leading
of thine own revenges,

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:44.125
take the one half of my commission.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:50.521
And set down
as best thou art experienced,

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.570
since thou knows thy country's
strength and weakness,

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:57.770
thine own ways, whether to knock
against the gates of Rome,

01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:03.245
or rudely visit them in parts
remote to fright them, ere destroy.

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:21.211
- Is this Menenius?
- O, 'tis he, 'tis he.

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.044
O, he's grown most kind of late.

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.771
- Hail, sir.
- Hail to you both.

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.685
Your Coriolanus is not much missed,
but with his friends.

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:31.923
All's well, and might
have been much better

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:35.527
- if he could have temporized.
- Where is he, hear you?

01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:37.250
I hear nothing.

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:39.528
His mother and his wife
hear nothing from him.

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.967
Caius Martius was
a worthy officer in the war,

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.527
but insolent, overcome with pride,

01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:46.409
ambitious past all thinking,
self-loving...

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:48.244
I think not so.

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:50.721
And Rome sits safe
and still without him.

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.127
- Shh!
- Shh!

01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:00.489
<i>There are reports the Volsces
with two several powers,</i>

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:03.126
<i>are entered in the Roman territories,</i>

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.604
<i>and with the deepest malice of the war,
destroy what lies before them.</i>

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:10.240
Shh!
- 'Tis Aufidius,

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.010
who, hearing of our Martius' banishment,

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:15.084
thrusts forth his horns
into the world again.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.526
Come, what talk you of Martius?

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.648
It cannot be the Volsces
dare break with us.

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.964
Cannot be? We have record that it can.

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:26.164
<i>The nobles in great earnestness
are going all to the Senate House.</i>

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:30.041
<i>Some news is coming
that turns their countenances.</i>

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.680
<i>Yes, the first report
is seconded, and more...</i>

01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:35.127
<i>...more fearful is delivered.</i>

01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:38.807
<i>Martius has joined with Aufidius.</i>

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:41.042
<i>He leads a power against Rome,</i>

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:44.647
<i>and vows revenge
as spacious as between</i>

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.201
<i>the youngest and oldest thing.</i>

01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:52.651
<i>A fearful army, led by Caius Martius</i>

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:56.771
<i>associated with Aufidius,
rages upon our territories,</i>

01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:58.809
<i>and have already overborne their way,</i>

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.531
<i>consumed with fire,
and took what lay before them.</i>

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.327
<i>Martius has joined with the Volscians.</i>

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:07.165
<i>He is their god.
He leads them like boys</i>

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:10.483
<i>pursuing summer butterflies
or butchers killing flies.</i>

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:05.442
Do they still fly to the Roman?

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:07.648
I do not know
what witchcraft's in him,

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:11.282
but your soldiers use him
as the grace before meat,

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:14.410
their talk at table,
and their thanks at end.

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:16.921
And you are darkened
in this action, sir.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.925
He bears himself more proud,
even to my person,

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:27.766
than I thought he would
when first I did embrace him.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:32.369
Sir, I beseech you,
think you he'll carry Rome?

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:39.164
I think he'll be to Rome
as is the osprey to the fish,

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:42.403
who takes it by sovereignty of nature.

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:46.360
Whether it was pride,
whether defect of judgment...

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:52.131
...or whether nature,
not to be other than one thing,

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:57.411
made him feared,
so hated, and so banished...

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:04.042
...so our virtues lie
in the interpretation of the time.

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:09.081
One fire drives out one fire...

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.931
...one nail, one nail.

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:21.207
Rights by rights falter,
strengths by strengths do fail.

01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:29.368
When, Caius,

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:34.208
Rome is thine,
thou art poorest of all...

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:40.968
...then shortly art thou mine.

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:43.804
No, I'll not go.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.049
- Good Menenius...
- Go, you that banished him.

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:52.286
A mile before his tent, fall down,
and kneel the way into his mercy.

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:18.925
He would not seem to know me.

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:24.209
I urged our old acquaintance,
and the drops

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.488
that we have bled together.

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:32.522
"Coriolanus" he would not answer to,
forbad all names.

01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:35.724
He was...

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.328
...a kind of nothing.

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:48.889
Titleless.

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:55.487
Till he had forged himself a name
in the fire of burning Rome.

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:00.245
If you refuse your aid in this...

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:03.006
If you would be your country's pleader,
your good tongue,

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:06.323
more than the instant army we can make,
might stop our countryman.

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:08.926
- No, I'll not meddle.
- Pray you, go to him.

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:12.641
- What should I do?
- Only make trial what your love can do

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:14.205
for Rome towards Martius.

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:20.208
Well, and say "Martius return me,
as Titus is returned, unhurt."

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:21.327
What then?

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:24.245
Yet your good will must have
that thanks from Rome.

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:28.689
You know the very road into his
kindness, and cannot lose your way.

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.526
I'll undertake it.

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:47.409
I think he'll hear me.

01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:00.042
- He'll never hear him.
- No?

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:03.204
I tell you, he does sit in gold...

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:08.363
...his eye, red, as it would burn Rome.

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:44.970
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod
about thy particular prosperity...

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:50.964
...and love thee no worse
than thy old friend Menenius does.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.243
O Martius, Martius.

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:01.848
Thou art preparing fire for us.

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:04.971
Look thee...

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.004
...there's water to quench it.

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.370
I was hardly moved to come to thee,

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:15.006
but being assured none
but myself could move thee,

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:20.291
I have been blown out
of your gates with sighs...

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:26.567
...and conjure thee to pardon Rome.

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:33.400
Away.

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:37.442
How? Away?

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:41.924
Wife... mother... child... I know not.

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:44.688
My affairs are servanted to others.

01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:47.241
- Sir...
- Therefore be gone.

01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:54.130
Another word, Menenius,
I will not hear thee speak.

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:41.205
This Martius is grown
from man to dragon.

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:43.684
He has wings.

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:48.331
He's more than a creeping thing.

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:08.923
There is no more mercy in him
than there is milk in a male tiger.

01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:33.084
My lord and husband.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.890
These eyes are not the same
I wore in Rome.

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:40.169
The sorrow that delivers us
thus changed makes you think so.

01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:45.690
Best of my flesh, forgive my tyranny,

01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:49.481
but do not say for that
"Forgive our Romans."

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:05.486
O, a kiss...

01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:09.761
...long as my exile...

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:17.607
...sweet as my revenge.

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:24.286
Ye gods, I prate,

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:27.842
and the most noble mother
of the world leave unsaluted.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.002
Sink, my knee, in the earth.

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:32.606
Stand up, blest.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.924
Whilst with no softer
cushion than the flint

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:40.050
- I kneel before thee.
- What's this?

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:42.720
Your knees to me?

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.530
To your corrected son?

01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:48.207
Thou art my warrior.
I helped to frame thee.

01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:51.045
This is a poor epitome of yours,

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:54.921
which by the interpretation of full time
may show like all yourself.

01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:08.522
The god of soldiers,
inform thy thoughts with nobleness,

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:11.411
that thou may'st prove
to shame, invulnerable.

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.285
Your knee, sir.

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:20.364
Even he, your wife,
this lady and myself,

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.488
- are suitors to you.
- I beseech you, peace.

01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:25.405
Or, if you'd ask, remember this:

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:28.006
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers,

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:31.130
or capitulate again
with Rome's mechanics.

01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:33.408
Tell me not wherein I seem unnatural.

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:38.043
Desire not to allay my rages
and revenges with your colder reasons.

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:42.283
No more, no more.

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:46.001
You have said you
will not grant us anything,

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:49.130
for we have nothing else to ask
but that which you deny already.

01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:52.841
Yet we will ask,
that if you fail in our request,

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.004
the blame may hang upon
your hardness. Therefore hear us.

01:40:56.680 --> 01:40:58.444
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark.

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:01.126
For we'll hear naught
from Rome in private.

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:11.325
Your request?

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:43.609
Should we be silent
and not speak, our raiment

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:48.163
and state of bodies would betray
what life we have led since thy exile.

01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:53.802
Think with thyself.

01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:59.970
How more unfortunate than all
living women are we come hither,

01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:05.331
since that thy sight, which should
make our eyes flow with joy,

01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:08.962
hearts dance with comforts...

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:15.602
...constrains them weep
and shake with fear and sorrow...

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:19.689
...making the mother, wife, and child

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:24.004
to see the son,
the husband and the father

01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:26.447
tearing his country's bowels out.

01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:30.804
And we must find an evident calamity,

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:33.930
though we had our wish,
which side should win.

01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:39.047
For either thou must,
as a foreign recreant,

01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:43.046
be led with manacles
through our streets,

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:47.410
or else, triumphantly,
tread on thy country's ruin,

01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:50.450
and bear the palm
for having bravely shed

01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:52.847
thy wife and children's blood.

01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:03.768
For myself... son...

01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:09.645
...I purpose not to wait on fortune
till these wars determine.

01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:12.565
If I cannot persuade thee
rather to show a noble grace

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:14.688
to both parts than seek the end to one,

01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:18.686
thou shalt no sooner march
to assault thy country

01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:21.525
than to tread on thy mother's womb...

01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:24.685
...that brought thee to this world.

01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:28.089
Aye, and mine,
that brought you forth this boy

01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:30.004
to keep your name living to time.

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.251
You shall not tread on me.

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:38.244
I'll run away till I'm bigger...

01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.490
...but then I'll fight!

01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:47.490
- I have sat too long.
- Nay, go not from us thus.

01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:53.204
If it were so that our request
did tend to save the Romans,

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:56.330
thereby to destroy
the Volsces whom you serve,

01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:01.646
thou might'st condemn us
as poisonous of your honor.

01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:06.089
No. Our suit is that
you reconcile them.

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:10.040
So that the Voices may say
"This mercy we have showed,"

01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:12.248
the Romans, "This we've received,"

01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:17.281
and each on either side
give the all-hail to thee and cry,

01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:19.249
"Be blest for making up this peace!"

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:28.401
Speak to me, son.

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:33.649
Why dost not speak?

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:41.811
Speak you, daughter.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.207
He cares not for your weeping.

01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:45.441
Speak thou, boy.

01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:50.086
Perhaps thy childishness will
move him more than can our reasons.

01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:52.766
There's no man in the world
more bound to his mother,

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:55.651
yet here he lets me prate
like one in the stocks!

01:44:55.800 --> 01:45:01.648
Thou hast never, in thy life,
shown thy dear mother any courtesy,

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:05.691
when she, poor hen,
has clucked thee to the wars

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:08.730
and safely home loaded with honor.

01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:13.044
Say my request's unjust and
spurn me back, but if it be not so...

01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:20.563
...thou art not honest
and the gods will plague thee,

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:25.248
that thou restrains from me the duty
which to a mother's part belongs.

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:32.369
Down, ladies.
Let us shame him with our knees!

01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:37.649
Down!

01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:41.289
This is the last.

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:44.848
An end.

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:57.209
So we will home to Rome,
and die among our neighbors.

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:02.931
Nay.

01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:08.410
Behold'st, this boy, that cannot
tell what he would have...

01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:13.642
...yet kneels and holds
up hands for fellowship.

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:18.164
Does reason our petition with more
strength than thou hast to deny it.

01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:25.848
Come, let us go.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.288
This fellow had
a Volscian to his mother!

01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:34.849
His wife is in Corioles and
his child like him by chance.

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:40.010
Yet give us our dispatch I am
hushed until our city be afire,

01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:41.884
and then I'll speak a little.

01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:02.329
O Mother...

01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:09.565
Mother...

01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:14.569
What have you done?

01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:21.044
Behold...

01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:28.962
...the heavens do ope...

01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:33.602
...the gods look down...

01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:43.051
...and this unnatural scene
they laugh at.

01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:51.407
O my mother!

01:47:58.120 --> 01:47:59.724
Mother!

01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:06.285
O!

01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:17.769
You have won...

01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:23.290
...a happy victory to Rome.

01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:29.681
But for your son, believe it.

01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:32.850
O believe it.

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:39.567
Most... dangerously
you have prevailed with him.

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:44.486
If not most mortal to him.

01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:51.006
But let it come.

01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:57.602
Aufidius...

01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:05.206
...though I cannot make true wars,
I'll frame convenient peace.

01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:08.649
Now, good Aufidius,
were you in my stead,

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:13.169
would you have heard a mother less?
Or granted less? Aufidius?

01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:16.404
I was moved withal.

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:21.284
I dare be sworn you were.
And, sir, it is no little thing

01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:23.841
to make mine eyes to sweat compassion.

01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:30.407
But, good sir, what peace
you'll make, advise me.

01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:24.050
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome.

01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:27.204
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:33.049
We have all great cause
to give great thanks.

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:38.761
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome.

01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:53.689
How is it with our general?

01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:56.525
As with a man by his own charity slain.

01:50:56.680 --> 01:51:01.208
Our soldiers will remain uncertain
whilst 'twixt you there's difference,

01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:03.931
but the fall of either
makes the survivor heir of all.

01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:05.445
I know it.

01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:10.245
And my pretext to strike
at him admits a good construction.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.289
I raised him, and I pawned
mine honor for his truth,

01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:20.643
who, being so heightened,

01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:24.361
he watered his new plants
with dews of flattery,

01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:26.170
seducing so my friends.

01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:32.686
At the last, I seemed his follower,
not partner,

01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:36.162
and he waged me with his countenance
as if I had been mercenary.

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:39.164
So he did, my lord.
The army marveled at it.

01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:42.051
And, in the last,
when he had carried Rome

01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:44.407
and that we looked
for no less spoil than glory...

01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:46.608
There was it!

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:49.371
For which my sinews shall be
stretched upon him.

01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:57.923
At a few drops of women's rheum,
which are as cheap as lies,

01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:02.927
he sold the blood and labor
of our great action.

01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:08.122
Therefore shall he die...

01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:14.286
- ...and I'll renew me in his fall.

01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:17.082
- Say no more.

01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:25.962
I am returned your soldier,

01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:29.761
no more infected with my country's love
than when I parted hence,

01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:34.005
but still subsisting
under your great command.

01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:37.283
We have made peace with
no less honor to the Volscians

01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:39.283
than shame to the Romans.

01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:41.841
Tell the traitor,
in the highest degree

01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:45.726
- he hath abused your powers.
- Traitor? How now?

01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:48.161
Aye, traitor, Martius.

01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:51.688
- "Martius"?
- Aye, Martius.

01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:54.524
Caius Martius.

01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:58.165
Dost thou think I'll grace
thee with that robbery,

01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:00.402
thy stolen name "Coriolanus"?

01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:06.329
Perfidiously he hath
betrayed your business

01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:11.811
and given up,
for certain drops of salt,

01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:13.689
your city, Rome.

01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:19.529
I say "your city,"
for his wife and mother.

01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:26.248
Breaking his oath and resolution
like a twist of rotten silk.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:30.846
Never admitting counsel of the war,
but at his nurse's tears,

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.288
he whined and roared away your victory.

01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:36.044
Hear'st thou, Mars?

01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:39.329
Name not the god, thou boy of tears.

01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:44.725
Measureless liar, thou has made my heart
too great for what contains it.

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:48.487
"Boy"? O slave.

01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:51.246
Cut me to pieces, Volsces!

01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:56.367
Men and lads,
stain all your edges on me!

01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:57.521
"Boy"?

01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:02.531
If you have writ your annals true,

01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:06.002
'tis there that,
like an eagle in a dovecote,

01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:09.721
I fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.

01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:12.651
Alone I did it.

01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:15.004
"Boy."

01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:23.970
Let him die for it.

01:55:24.305 --> 01:55:30.343
