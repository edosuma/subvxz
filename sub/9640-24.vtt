WEBVTT

00:03.400 --> 00:07.500
Oh, no. Please tell me that's
not a new robot you're building.

00:07.500 --> 00:10.133
Uh, no, it's a pencil holder
I made Dad for his birthday.

00:10.133 --> 00:13.500
This is the new robot
I'm building.

00:13.500 --> 00:16.734
A pencil holder?
It looks like an old soup can.

00:16.734 --> 00:18.867
That's because
it was an old soup can.

00:18.867 --> 00:20.834
Now it's a heartfelt gift
I've made for Dad

00:20.834 --> 00:23.834
by removing the label and
writing a clever slogan
on the side.

00:23.834 --> 00:27.767
"Number one Dad,
number two pencil."

00:27.767 --> 00:31.233
- [laughs]
- Are you kidding me?

00:31.233 --> 00:34.867
Well, I also charmed it
to magically sharpen pencils.

00:35.834 --> 00:38.367
[whirring]

00:40.300 --> 00:43.200
Yes, because it's
so hard to do this.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.667
I didn't get him anything.
Put my name on it.

00:46.667 --> 00:49.300
Oh, no, you're not sharing
credit for my gift this year.

00:49.300 --> 00:52.000
Fine, if that's
the way you want it.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.233
You're probably going
to regret that decision.

00:54.233 --> 00:56.367
I'm not scared of you, Alex.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.133
Stop staring at me.

01:03.767 --> 01:05.400
Max, you're not gonna wrap
that cat up

01:05.400 --> 01:07.500
and give it to Dad
for his birthday again, are you?

01:07.500 --> 01:10.000
He loves getting
this cat every year.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.667
[chuckles] He thinks
he has a collection.

01:12.667 --> 01:14.500
Hello, number eight.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.600
Max, it's time you started
learning from your big bro.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.300
So I'm gonna let you
jump on board

01:19.300 --> 01:21.500
with my thoughtful
and unique gift.

01:21.500 --> 01:25.200
Wait, you'll let him
put his name on your
gift but not mine?

01:25.200 --> 01:27.600
Fine. Max,
before you agree to that,

01:27.600 --> 01:29.133
I'm gonna let you in
on my gift.

01:29.133 --> 01:31.734
- What's your gift?
- I don't know yet.

01:31.734 --> 01:34.967
But you can be sure it's not
gonna look like something

01:34.967 --> 01:37.200
you could find in a
kindergarten classroom.

01:37.200 --> 01:41.100
Let's see:
cat, soup can, nothing.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.600
I'm gonna stick with the cat.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.867
Hey, look who it is.
It's the birthday guy.

01:47.867 --> 01:49.367
The guy whose birthday it is.

01:49.367 --> 01:51.934
Obviously, I'm not ignoring it,
because I keep saying it.

01:51.934 --> 01:54.133
Birthday, birthday, birthday.

01:54.133 --> 01:57.300
Oh. Look, Theresa. The kids
are talking about my birthday.

01:57.300 --> 01:58.934
OK, honey, I get it.

01:58.934 --> 02:00.500
I forgot to say
"happy birthday"

02:00.500 --> 02:01.967
right when you
woke up this morning.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.467
Uh, Daddy, Justin and I
got you a gift together.

02:06.467 --> 02:08.867
Play along,
or your robot gets it.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.400
I got ten of them.

02:10.400 --> 02:13.500
Dad, here's a gift from me.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.367
It's a homemade,
magic pencil holder.

02:16.367 --> 02:21.033
Oh! It's perfect. It combines
two of my greatest loves:

02:21.033 --> 02:24.033
Canned foods and things
that hold other things.

02:24.033 --> 02:29.700
Perfect? [laughs]
I'm so glad that you like it.

02:33.100 --> 02:36.200
Um, that's from me too, Dad.

02:36.200 --> 02:39.100
He seems to like it,
so I'm in.

03:41.300 --> 03:44.000
- What are you doing?
- You'll be interested to know

03:44.000 --> 03:46.200
that I've found the perfect
present for Dad.

03:46.200 --> 03:49.500
[gasps] She's gonna turn
her lips into a zipper?

03:49.500 --> 03:51.000
Ooh! That's a good shot.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.500
How long have you been
working on that one?

03:52.500 --> 03:54.033
Since the day Mom
came home and said,

03:54.033 --> 03:56.667
"Look, there's your
little sister, Justin."

04:00.100 --> 04:04.734
Well, I'm giving Dad the gift of
magic powers for his birthday.

04:04.734 --> 04:06.867
What are you talking about?
Our powers are limited.

04:06.867 --> 04:09.100
We can't give
magical powers to a mortal.

04:09.100 --> 04:11.400
Ah! That's where you're wrong,
"Johnny Can't Skip."

04:12.967 --> 04:14.967
Skipping is
an unnatural body motion.

04:14.967 --> 04:16.967
There's a moment when both feet
are off the ground.

04:16.967 --> 04:18.734
It's way too unpredictable.
[scoffs]

04:20.500 --> 04:22.133
Look, I've done
a lot of research

04:22.133 --> 04:24.600
and there's this thing
called Merlin's Hat.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.934
It gives whoever wears it
unlimited magical wishes

04:26.934 --> 04:28.000
for a whole day.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.500
- You actually researched that?
- Sort of.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.867
It was on the first page
I opened up to in this book.

04:33.867 --> 04:38.000
Well, you have to perform
a deed of incredible
selflessness and bravery

04:38.000 --> 04:39.834
in the wizard world
to get Merlin's Hat.

04:39.834 --> 04:41.400
We all know that's
not gonna happen.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.667
- Oh, really? Hold this.
- Really. No. OK.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.934
[coughing]

04:54.934 --> 04:59.567
- Alex, are you OK?
- [coughs]

04:59.567 --> 05:01.667
- I think so.
- What happened?

05:01.667 --> 05:03.200
Nothing much.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.367
- Really?
- Yeah,

05:05.367 --> 05:07.900
if you call saving an
entire wizard rec center

05:07.900 --> 05:10.200
from a dragon attack
"nothing much"!

05:11.367 --> 05:13.967
Check it out. Merlin's Hat.

05:13.967 --> 05:16.934
By the way, we're having
dragon heart for dinner.

05:21.367 --> 05:24.133
And so, to prove there
are more than only

05:24.133 --> 05:26.233
two good children
in this family,

05:26.233 --> 05:29.367
I'd like to present my father
with a birthday present.

05:29.367 --> 05:33.233
It's probably earrings
or something else she wanted.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.100
Alex, is this what
I think it is?

05:39.100 --> 05:42.300
- Is this Merlin's Hat?
- Yes, and when you put it on,

05:42.300 --> 05:44.867
you have unlimited magical
wishes for a whole day.

05:44.867 --> 05:47.567
- Awesome.
- That's from me too, Dad.
[chuckles]

05:47.567 --> 05:50.500
- What about our pencil holder?
- Unlimited wishes,
pencil holder.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.400
Come on,
I'm not an idiot.

05:56.367 --> 05:59.100
- This is amazing, Alex.
- [clears throat]

05:59.100 --> 06:02.500
And Max.
You've given me powers again.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.200
Yes, she's pulled magic
into the real world

06:04.200 --> 06:05.467
for selfish reasons.

06:05.467 --> 06:07.033
What could
possibly go wrong?

06:09.400 --> 06:12.767
Come on, Dad. Get up and say,
"Goonga galoonga,"
and make a wish.

06:12.767 --> 06:16.000
You don't really have to say,
"Goonga galoonga."
It's just funny.

06:17.567 --> 06:20.900
All right. I'm a little rusty,
but here goes...

06:22.300 --> 06:26.033
Goonga galoonga.
[laughs]

06:26.033 --> 06:27.400
Look at that!

06:30.200 --> 06:32.200
- Pencils?
- Yeah.

06:32.200 --> 06:35.767
To put in my new
favorite pencil holder.

06:35.767 --> 06:39.000
- Pencils?
- I'm back on Justin's gift.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.834
- Pencils?
- Hey, look at that!

06:43.834 --> 06:46.734
They're already sharp!
Thank you, Justin.

06:46.734 --> 06:50.900
Uh, doesn't anybody hear me
repeating the word "pencils"
over here?

06:50.900 --> 06:54.200
I don't know if you noticed,
but Dad just used your gift

06:54.200 --> 06:55.600
to make my gift better.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.500
- I noticed.
- I know.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.934
Dad, you realize you can
do anything you want

06:59.934 --> 07:01.900
with that hat, right?
Literally.

07:01.900 --> 07:04.500
Anything at all,
in the whole world.

07:04.500 --> 07:07.200
You want me
to try it again, huh?

07:07.200 --> 07:11.033
All right, uh...
Mmm... There's...

07:11.033 --> 07:12.467
Ooh, I got it.

07:15.367 --> 07:18.233
Goonga galoonga.

07:18.233 --> 07:22.200
Yes! Huh? [laughs]

07:22.200 --> 07:27.834
- A milkshake?
- Not just any milkshake.

07:27.834 --> 07:32.767
This is a Milky Way Milkshake
from The Asteroid Belt.

07:32.767 --> 07:36.100
That was his favorite restaurant
when he was a kid
in the neighborhood.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.300
He reminds me of it every
time he has a milkshake.

07:38.300 --> 07:39.500
So pretty much every day.

07:41.033 --> 07:42.600
The place doesn't exist anymore.

07:42.600 --> 07:46.100
It had this cool
'50s sci-fi theme.

07:46.100 --> 07:51.500
Mm. Boy, I forgot how exciting
it is to have powers!

07:51.500 --> 07:53.500
Dad, you're wrecking
the word "exciting."

07:55.400 --> 07:57.300
Face it, Alex. Your gift
just isn't as impressive

07:57.300 --> 07:59.133
as you thought it would be.

07:59.133 --> 08:01.567
I don't know about that.
I'd say this milkshake

08:01.567 --> 08:03.233
is the next best thing
to having

08:03.233 --> 08:06.000
the actual Asteroid Belt
open again.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.900
Open again.
Interesting.

08:17.667 --> 08:21.100
Goonga galoonga.
That is fun to say.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.033
Guys, come down here
and see how great I am!

08:32.400 --> 08:38.000
Oh, my gosh!
Alex, what have you done?

08:38.000 --> 08:41.900
I just wanted to show Dad
how to use the hat right.

08:41.900 --> 08:45.467
It looks just like
The Asteroid Belt,

08:45.467 --> 08:48.600
with the rocket ships and...

08:48.600 --> 08:50.600
The chair's the same!

08:52.000 --> 08:56.233
Honey, look! The original
Milky Way Milkshake machine.

08:58.967 --> 09:01.967
I love this so much!

09:01.967 --> 09:04.000
Really? You love it?

09:04.000 --> 09:08.667
Did you hear that?
He loves it so much.

09:11.767 --> 09:16.800
- This is incredible, Alex.
- Yeah, it's, uh,
also from me too, Dad.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.567
This was a great trip
down memory lane.

09:20.567 --> 09:23.500
And I will never forget it.

09:23.500 --> 09:27.800
Now you should turn it back
into the sub shop.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.800
- Turn it back?
But you just got it.
- No, I know. It was fun.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.867
But, you know,
you should turn it back.

09:32.867 --> 09:35.500
You heard him, Alex.
Turn it back.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.567
Excuse me.

09:39.567 --> 09:41.967
This looks like a place I used
to go to when I was a kid.

09:41.967 --> 09:45.000
- I'm sorry, we're closed.
- Oh!

09:45.000 --> 09:48.367
I'd pay anything for
one of those milkshakes.

09:51.233 --> 09:54.100
Anything?

09:54.100 --> 09:55.233
Ten dollars.

09:55.233 --> 09:57.000
We'll take three.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.300
Maybe we should keep it
like this for a while.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.367
- You should have said 15.
- Ooh! Welcome.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.767
[laughs]
This place is a hit.

10:11.767 --> 10:13.500
I've never seen it
this crowded before.

10:13.500 --> 10:17.000
We are raking it in.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.734
[sighs] See how happy
Dad is?

10:20.734 --> 10:24.133
My gift is so good, I don't
even want you on it, Max.

10:24.133 --> 10:27.600
- You're off of it.
- What'd I do
to get kicked off the gift?

10:27.600 --> 10:29.834
Restaurants themes
like this are just a fad.

10:29.834 --> 10:31.734
They never last.
Believe me.

10:31.734 --> 10:36.800
Mr. Russo, we're with
the Waverly Place
Merchants' Association

10:36.800 --> 10:39.200
and we've come to present you
with an award

10:39.200 --> 10:41.000
for having a fantastic fad

10:41.000 --> 10:43.600
that's not going anywhere
anytime soon.

10:45.567 --> 10:49.233
We hereby declare you
King of the New York Milkshake

10:49.233 --> 10:51.834
for your delicious
Milky Way Milkshake.

10:51.834 --> 10:55.200
King of the New York Milkshake?
Are you serious?

10:55.200 --> 10:58.200
Perhaps this
official-looking certificate

10:58.200 --> 11:02.467
- will answer that question.
- Oh! Thank you.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.967
Theresa, check it out.

11:05.967 --> 11:09.767
I guess it's no surprise
when you marry Prince Charming,

11:09.767 --> 11:12.000
he grows up to be a king.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.467
You know, that probably
should've seemed arrogant to me,

11:16.467 --> 11:20.400
but I find your newfound
confidence very appealing.

11:22.400 --> 11:26.200
Alex, your gift just keeps
getting better and better.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.667
I'm glad you think so, Dad.

11:27.667 --> 11:30.200
But could you say that a little
louder so Justin can hear you?

11:30.200 --> 11:33.000
- I'm standing right here.
- I know.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.600
I just wanted to hear him
say it louder.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.000
Thank you all for including me
in your family meeting.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.867
It's better than how we do it
at my house:

11:46.867 --> 11:50.200
from separate rooms
on walkie-talkies.

11:51.867 --> 11:55.900
Now... as you all know,

11:55.900 --> 11:59.567
we're no longer that crummy
train restaurant.

11:59.567 --> 12:02.700
We are now an amazing
spaceship restaurant.

12:02.700 --> 12:06.567
Yes, amazing. Put that in your
family meeting notes, Justin.

12:06.567 --> 12:09.667
A-M-A-Zing. On you.

12:14.100 --> 12:17.367
The bear, me, you: bear trap.

12:20.767 --> 12:23.800
OK, everybody,
let's listen to your father.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.500
He's taking charge,
for once in his life,

12:25.500 --> 12:28.000
and I, for one,
can't get enough of it.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Now, with our new popularity,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.800
it's gonna take more people
per shift to cover the demand.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.934
- Oh!
- Whoa.

12:36.734 --> 12:39.033
I thought this restaurant
represented the future.

12:39.033 --> 12:41.000
Shouldn't there be
less work in the future?

12:42.000 --> 12:45.100
Oh!

12:45.100 --> 12:48.300
- Harper, you're hired.
- Yes!

12:48.300 --> 12:51.500
Oh, I hope I didn't
sound too desperate.

12:51.500 --> 12:54.567
My mom says that's how people
get taken advantage of.

12:54.567 --> 12:57.400
[laughs] Oh, Harper, no one's
taking advantage of you.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.967
You've got
the first four shifts.

13:00.300 --> 13:01.734
And you guys
have all the rest.

13:01.734 --> 13:04.467
Thanks a lot, Alex.

13:04.467 --> 13:06.767
Now I don't want to hear
any complaints because

13:06.767 --> 13:09.600
I also got us
great new uniforms.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.200
This can't be good.

13:13.867 --> 13:16.133
You're all waiter-nauts.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.934
They're not the
most comfortable outfits,

13:19.934 --> 13:23.033
but you'll get used to
the limited range of motion.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.400
Harper, I don't know how
much more of this I can take.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.133
What are you talking about?

13:30.133 --> 13:32.300
This is more breathable
than most things I wear.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.300
- [ringing]
- Oh! Oh!

13:34.300 --> 13:37.033
It's time for our
hourly rocket launch

13:37.033 --> 13:39.667
here at
The Waverly Asteroid Belt.

13:39.667 --> 13:44.000
Where the deals are
out of this world!

13:44.000 --> 13:46.934
Dad, you're selling food,
not electronics.

13:46.934 --> 13:49.400
- For now.
- Ready!

13:51.233 --> 13:55.200
Five, four, three, two, one!

13:55.200 --> 13:59.400
- [rumbling]
- [all] Whoa!

14:06.133 --> 14:08.800
Salute!

14:11.033 --> 14:14.767
- You didn't salute.
- I didn't do a lot of things.

14:18.300 --> 14:21.000
Justin, you win.
This was a bad idea.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.834
You have to help me
get rid of this place.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.900
I'm sorry you
feel that way, Alex.

14:24.900 --> 14:27.500
But, uh, I'd also
like to point out this:

14:32.867 --> 14:34.033
What is wrong with you?

14:34.033 --> 14:36.800
That's right.
I learned how to skip.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.667
This outfit has gotten me
a lot of attention

14:38.667 --> 14:42.000
from a very interesting,
fringe group of women. Hi.

14:47.033 --> 14:51.100
And the Alien Language League
finally has a suitable place
to meet.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.600
What's up, Zeke?
[speaking alien language]

14:53.600 --> 14:56.200
- Oh, my gosh, really? Show me.
- Mm-hm.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.667
- [speaks alien language]
- Thanks.

15:05.667 --> 15:08.300
I call it power hoppin'.
[speaks alien language]

15:09.767 --> 15:12.567
Oh, my gosh.
I have to make this stop.

15:16.133 --> 15:20.233
- What's going on?
- I made a really bad decision
with this present for my dad.

15:20.233 --> 15:22.934
Having a popular restaurant
is way too much work.

15:22.934 --> 15:25.467
I'd rather have a place
that's barely scraping by,

15:25.467 --> 15:27.100
like our old Sub Station.

15:28.600 --> 15:31.800
I'm just gonna put this hat on
and wish for it all to go away.

15:31.800 --> 15:32.867
Goonga ga...

15:36.400 --> 15:39.200
Look at how happy he is.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.200
I can't take this away from him.

15:41.200 --> 15:45.000
Oh, Tin Man.
You do have a heart.

15:48.200 --> 15:51.900
Yes, but only until
I get tired of lording
this over Justin.

15:51.900 --> 15:55.000
Oh, who are we kidding?
I'll never get tired of that.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.934
- [crashing, sputtering]
- What was that?

16:00.934 --> 16:03.200
Let's split up
and see what's going on!

16:03.200 --> 16:04.300
I'll go outside!

16:04.300 --> 16:06.100
I'm gonna go check
under your bed. Bye!

16:09.367 --> 16:12.567
[rumbling]

16:16.600 --> 16:18.000
Do you guys believe it?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.867
Aliens have landed
on Waverly Place.

16:20.867 --> 16:23.233
Who's gonna tell them
they can't park there?

16:23.233 --> 16:25.000
They're gonna get towed.

16:26.834 --> 16:30.767
I've been waiting my
entire life for this moment!

16:30.767 --> 16:33.500
- [zooming]
- [crowd screams]

16:34.767 --> 16:37.867
I got this.
[clears throat]

16:39.300 --> 16:41.800
[speaking alien language]

16:45.133 --> 16:47.967
I have no idea what you
are talking about, kid.

16:47.967 --> 16:50.100
I just welcomed you
to this planet

16:50.100 --> 16:53.367
and offered you
my eternal brotherhood.

16:53.367 --> 16:55.800
Sounded like a lot
of gibberish, if you ask me.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.900
[gasping] That's 'cause you're
from the wrong planet.

17:01.967 --> 17:05.200
Listen up, earthlings.
We have come to your street

17:05.200 --> 17:08.200
because we heard that
the Milky Way Milkshake
has been brought back.

17:08.200 --> 17:12.100
We have always believed
that the Milky Way Milkshake

17:12.100 --> 17:15.967
is the tastiest milkshake
in the entire universe.

17:15.967 --> 17:20.100
And now that the machine is
back up and running, we want it.

17:20.100 --> 17:22.567
And we intend to get it.

17:22.567 --> 17:24.700
[crowd screaming]

17:24.700 --> 17:27.300
Thanks to your magic gift,
real aliens have come here.

17:27.300 --> 17:28.700
What are we supposed
to do now?

17:30.400 --> 17:33.233
Lie our butts off.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.100
You know I'm not
really comfortable...
Oh, right, I got it.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.900
[clears throat]

17:40.900 --> 17:46.567
Uh, fellow citizens of New York
City and the outlying boroughs,

17:46.567 --> 17:50.967
don't panic. This is just
an elaborate promotional stunt,

17:50.967 --> 17:54.767
yes, a promotional stunt,
for the new restaurant here.

17:54.767 --> 17:57.800
That's right.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.834
Because if these
were real aliens,

17:59.834 --> 18:03.667
they would probably
look much more expensive.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.934
- What's that?
- Yeah...

18:07.400 --> 18:10.600
- Wizards dressed as aliens?
- Real aliens.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.200
[both] Oh, boy.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.900
Who are you?

18:13.900 --> 18:17.600
He's King of the
New York Milkshake.

18:18.834 --> 18:20.100
- No...
- Regular...

18:20.100 --> 18:22.400
Thanks a lot!

18:25.800 --> 18:27.600
Hand over the
milkshake machine.

18:30.200 --> 18:33.700
- Here's the milkshake machine.
- [gasps] Jerry!

18:35.100 --> 18:37.467
All right, fine. Everybody,
run for your lives!

18:37.467 --> 18:40.133
- [blasting]
- [ricocheting]

18:40.133 --> 18:41.600
Justin, I hate
to tell you this,

18:41.600 --> 18:43.900
but this was a poorly
conceived promotional stunt.

18:43.900 --> 18:45.600
That's coming from a guy
who is susceptible

18:45.600 --> 18:46.934
to commercial ad campaigns.

18:47.867 --> 18:50.100
- [grunts]
- [shattering]

18:50.100 --> 18:53.467
[grunting]

18:53.467 --> 18:55.767
Jerry, help us!

18:55.767 --> 18:58.100
Uh...

19:01.400 --> 19:04.867
Ah!
Not the milkshake machine!

19:04.867 --> 19:08.367
- Please!
- I knew it.

19:09.300 --> 19:10.367
[yelps]

19:11.500 --> 19:14.767
Max, you always play
those alien video games.

19:14.767 --> 19:17.834
- Try to reason with them.
- I'm not really that good.

19:17.834 --> 19:20.000
You only let me play
an hour a day.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.567
That's because you have
a C-minus in math.

19:22.567 --> 19:24.834
Are we really having this
conversation right now?

19:24.834 --> 19:28.500
C-minus? How are you
doing better than me?

19:29.500 --> 19:32.300
[screaming]

19:32.300 --> 19:35.467
Are you happy now?
You just had to get a better
gift than me, didn't you?

19:35.467 --> 19:37.200
Can you just forget about that
for one second?

19:37.200 --> 19:39.867
They're closing in on Dad.
What should we do?

19:39.867 --> 19:42.734
[Jerry] Alex!
Give me Merlin's Hat!

19:47.667 --> 19:49.934
Goonga galoonga.

19:49.934 --> 19:53.200
Did it work?
Am I alone on the big island?

19:53.200 --> 19:55.600
[Theresa] Ha! I knew it!

19:57.667 --> 19:59.200
What is wrong with this thing?

19:59.200 --> 20:00.800
You only get one day
to make wishes,

20:00.800 --> 20:02.600
that was yesterday.
The hat's powerless.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.300
Uh-oh.

20:07.367 --> 20:10.734
Dad, I'm sorry.
I guess if we've learned
one thing here today,

20:10.734 --> 20:13.767
it's that I should stop
trying to be nice to people.

20:19.100 --> 20:22.734
Hey, what happened? Where
did the milkshake machine go?

20:22.734 --> 20:24.967
Justin! You did it!

20:24.967 --> 20:27.834
Luckily, one of those aliens
dropped this thing

20:27.834 --> 20:29.734
and I was able to quickly figure
out how to operate

20:29.734 --> 20:32.867
their advanced technology.
It's a switch.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.600
Well, this is just great.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.367
Come on, guys,
we've got a long trip back.

20:47.934 --> 20:50.133
How did you know
that shooting Merlin's Hat

20:50.133 --> 20:51.734
would reverse
all of Dad's wishes?

20:51.734 --> 20:53.800
I didn't.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.300
I was just really
sick of that present.

20:56.300 --> 20:59.367
And how did you know you
wouldn't hit me with a laser?

20:59.367 --> 21:03.200
Well, Dad, that was a risk
I was willing to take.

21:05.133 --> 21:07.300
And Dad,
why did you try to trade me?

21:07.300 --> 21:10.367
Son, there is
no doubt in my mind

21:10.367 --> 21:12.600
they would have brought
you back in a day.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.300
[mouths]

21:15.900 --> 21:19.500
- Oh!
- Uh!

21:19.500 --> 21:21.834
Why are we all hugging?

21:21.834 --> 21:25.367
Because that's
what normal families do.

21:25.367 --> 21:28.133
[spaceship launching off]

21:32.800 --> 21:35.100
Dad, I'm sorry about
wrecking your birthday.

21:35.100 --> 21:37.300
I just wanted you to have
a good birthday gift.

21:37.300 --> 21:40.567
I know you did, honey.
And I appreciate it.

21:40.567 --> 21:44.600
I just want you guys
to know that everything
isn't about big birthday gifts.

21:44.600 --> 21:48.000
Sometimes, it's the simple,
little gifts that
are the best ones.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.667
That goes for magic too.

21:49.667 --> 21:52.000
It's not always about
slaying dragons

21:52.000 --> 21:55.233
or bringing a restaurant
back from the past.

21:55.233 --> 21:59.600
Sometimes, a soup can
that's charmed to do this...

21:59.600 --> 22:03.734
- [whirring]
- ...is all you need.

22:05.233 --> 22:09.000
I even missed the little cat
that Max gives me every year.

22:10.100 --> 22:13.500
You did? Hang on.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.200
Happy birthday, Dad.

22:22.667 --> 22:24.100
I wonder what it is.
