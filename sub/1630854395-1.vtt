Why are you shaking your nalgas
for the whole world to see?

00:44.919 --> 00:47.547
- I'm connecting with other
women who have daddy issues.

00:47.589 --> 00:50.091
- Oh, I'm sure you'll connect
with some daddies on there too.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.554
- Why would I take
social media advice from you?

00:54.596 --> 00:58.266
You thought Instagram was
a weed delivery service.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.101
- Sometimes it is.

01:01.269 --> 01:02.395
I like the dancing, though.

- What kind of measurement is
"as long as your arm"?

01:30.256 --> 01:31.508
- You want it
to be exact, right?

01:31.549 --> 01:34.552
My arm is always the same.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.221
- What if someone else
uses your measurements

01:36.262 --> 01:38.932
and they use their arm?

01:38.973 --> 01:40.266
- That's a good note.

01:41.851 --> 01:44.270
You know, Mayan, this kitchen
would get done a lot faster

01:44.312 --> 01:45.855
if I could stay overnight.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.775
This two-hour drive back
and forth is making me tired.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.528
- It would get done faster
if I hired a contractor

01:51.569 --> 01:52.779
who didn't always have a beer

01:52.821 --> 01:55.865
at the end
of his measuring arm.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.534
- Yeah, I mean, forget it.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.619
You know, has this ever
happened to you, Mayan,

01:59.661 --> 02:01.788
when you're driving,
and you close your eyes,

02:01.830 --> 02:03.707
and you wake up and you go,
"That's not my house.

02:03.748 --> 02:06.626
That's a tree!"

02:06.668 --> 02:08.586
- I don't know
about you staying here, Dad.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.171
I mean, it's only been,
like, six weeks

02:10.213 --> 02:11.673
since we started
hanging out again.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.425
- But it's been going good,
right?

02:13.466 --> 02:17.137
- Yeah, I mean, you come here,
you do stuff for me,

02:17.178 --> 02:19.347
we laugh, and you go home.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.183
I love that last part.

02:23.184 --> 02:27.188
- Please, Mayan, look,
I just want to do a good job.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.482
- Okay, I still have
to ask Quinten.

02:29.524 --> 02:32.110
But this is my house, my rules.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.445
And we gotta set
some boundaries

02:33.486 --> 02:34.487
so you don't trigger me.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.197
- "Trigger"? Wait a minute.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.450
You got a gun, Mayan?

02:38.491 --> 02:40.869
I'm so proud of you!

02:40.910 --> 02:42.245
- Emotionally trigger.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.872
I hate guns.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.915
You have a gun?

02:45.957 --> 02:47.250
- Not on me.

02:50.253 --> 02:54.716
Okay, so how do I avoid these
Los Triggers del Norte?

02:56.468 --> 02:58.553
- Well, one of my triggers
is when you lie to me.

02:58.595 --> 02:59.763
- I never lie to you.

02:59.804 --> 03:00.847
- That's a lie.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.307
- That is a lie.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.643
- Another trigger is
when you yell at me.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.854
- I never yell at you.
- That's another lie.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.690
- Okay, this is starting
to feel like a series of traps.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.693
Yelling is the Lopez way.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.403
It's so people
take you seriously.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.280
My nana used to say,
"There's the right way,

03:17.322 --> 03:20.033
and then there's
the Lopez way."

03:20.075 --> 03:22.452
She would take off her chancla
and throw it at you

03:22.494 --> 03:25.580
and hit you,
so you never forgot.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.249
And you know what?
I never forgot. Right here.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.754
- Yeah, well, my therapist says
that instead of yelling,

03:32.796 --> 03:35.465
I should resolve conflicts
through empathetic listening

03:35.507 --> 03:37.509
and mutual understanding.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.469
- I--I wasn't listening.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.391
- Grandpa!
- Hey, what's up, Gordo?

03:44.432 --> 03:46.601
- My name is Chance, not Gordo.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.855
And I'm not fat. I got gains.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.775
Just a few cupcakes away
from riding shotgun.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.445
- I'm still not
calling you Chance,

03:57.487 --> 03:59.614
'cause it looks like
there's a chance

03:59.656 --> 04:02.075
that's not your father.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.618
- [laughs nervously]

04:05.995 --> 04:07.914
Why would you say
something like that?

04:07.956 --> 04:10.375
- Because the kid looks
very Mexican,

04:10.417 --> 04:11.751
and you look like somebody

04:11.793 --> 04:13.712
that wouldn't get a rose
on "The Bachelorette."

04:16.339 --> 04:18.633
- [clears throat]
Look, George,

04:18.675 --> 04:20.427
even though I'm not
the toxic alpha male

04:20.468 --> 04:21.970
you wanted
for Mayan's life partner,

04:22.012 --> 04:23.888
I am confident in who I am.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.932
So you can't hurt me.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.976
- Yeah, you broke eye contact
at the end there, bro.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.480
- Damn it.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.774
- Grandpa, can you make me
a green juice?

04:34.816 --> 04:36.234
- You want some greens?
Come on.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.569
You pick your nose and eat it

04:37.610 --> 04:38.945
like a real kid, huh?

04:38.987 --> 04:40.405
Nature's candy. Come on.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.577
- So my dad asked
if he could stay here.

04:45.618 --> 04:48.038
- What, for, like, dinner?

04:48.079 --> 04:49.581
- Just till he finishes
the kitchen.

04:49.622 --> 04:50.957
Just remember to stay

04:50.999 --> 04:53.335
at least three George Lopez
arms away from him.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.003
- All right.

04:55.045 --> 04:59.674

04:59.716 --> 05:02.052
- I'm here.
- Oh, no one cares.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.347
Don't look, mijo.
You'll turn into stone.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.432
- Hi, Mama.
- Mm, hi.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.767
I just came to tell my family

05:08.808 --> 05:10.810
that I sold five policies
this morning.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.812
Rosie,
la reina of home insurance,

05:12.854 --> 05:14.105
is killing it.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.982
I'm going to be bigger
than the Progressive lady

05:16.024 --> 05:17.067
and the Aflac duck.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.404
- You already got the voice.

05:21.446 --> 05:25.784
"I'm Rosie."
[quacking]

05:25.825 --> 05:27.911
You saw
that Mayan and I did a TikTok,

05:27.952 --> 05:30.372
and you wanted to come over
here and make things awkward.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.040
- If I wanted
to make things awkward,

05:32.082 --> 05:34.459
I'd show Mayan all your
drunken late-night texts

05:34.501 --> 05:37.045
asking, "You up?"

05:37.087 --> 05:39.047
- I was up.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.721
- This is Mayan Lopez,

05:46.763 --> 05:48.598
Does climate change
concern you?

05:51.851 --> 05:53.728
- Are you a fan of Doja Cat?

05:56.856 --> 05:58.775
- What are your views
on Bitcoin?

06:03.405 --> 06:05.073
- This guy is sitting
in his pictures,

06:05.115 --> 06:06.449
which means he's short.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.368
Left.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.537
This guy is sitting in his car,

06:10.578 --> 06:13.039
which means he's short
and married.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.376
I see you, sir. Left.

06:16.418 --> 06:19.546
- Brookie, if you never
swipe right, what's the point?

06:19.587 --> 06:21.297
- I swipe right
on the rich guys.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.425
And I refer them
to my OnlyFans.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.511
What? It's just my feet.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.430
I'm not a freak.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.851
- Ugh, Duchess the chihuahua
is coming in today.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.561
You know,
I hate when rich people

06:34.602 --> 06:36.104
expect everything to be free.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.565
That woman won't pay
for her dog's butt exam

06:38.606 --> 06:41.151
because she's like,
"It's so small,

06:41.192 --> 06:43.570
Like, how can you
even charge for that?"

06:46.614 --> 06:49.576
- Ooh, the princess is here.

06:49.617 --> 06:51.536
- Hello, Duchess.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.080
- No, Duchess does not
touch the floor.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.790
Dogs have been on that.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.959
- I'm sorry.
Does Duchess identify as human?

06:58.001 --> 07:00.628
Because she clearly presents
as a dog.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.925
Anyway...while you're here,

07:05.967 --> 07:08.094
there's a number of outstanding
services on your bill--

07:08.136 --> 07:09.554
- Oh, could you please
send me an email?

07:09.596 --> 07:11.097
I'm late for pilates.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.059
- Well, we've let you defer
the last three visits, so--

07:14.100 --> 07:15.352
- So that's a yes.

07:15.393 --> 07:16.519
Goodbye, my darling.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.396
Mommy will miss you.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.565
[smooching]

07:29.074 --> 07:31.159
- Orale, muchachos.
Thanks for the help, man.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.535
Take a break, huh?

07:32.577 --> 07:33.995
There you go.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.247
No domestic beer
for you, Oscar.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.958
My best friend deserves
only the best imported.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.335
- Thanks, man.

07:40.377 --> 07:41.753
Hey, you know what would be
even better, though?

07:41.795 --> 07:44.130
- If we were high.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.924
- How'd you know
I was gonna say that?

07:45.965 --> 07:47.342
- 'Cause you said
the same thing this morning,

07:47.384 --> 07:48.468
then we got high.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.470
[both laugh]

07:50.512 --> 07:51.805
[door slams]
- Hey, take it easy.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.515
Some of us are high.

07:55.767 --> 07:59.020
- Sorry, there's an entitled
white lady at work.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.313
- Just one?

08:00.355 --> 08:03.233
- One is all you need
to ground a Delta flight.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.404
- She treats us all like crap.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.489
- Sounds like you need
to show her the Lopez way.

08:09.531 --> 08:10.824
- Please don't start.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.867
- It's a foolproof method.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.828
It's even how
your mom and I fell in love.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.831
On our first date,
we made the waiter cry.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.082
- That's not something
to be proud of.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.750
- Then why did we take
a picture?

08:22.377 --> 08:25.171
If you want results,
don't hold back, okay?

08:25.213 --> 08:26.840
Hell, I do it to Oscar
all the time.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.842
- You do?
- Listen, this isn't about you.

08:28.883 --> 08:29.843
Now, why don't you mind
your own business

08:29.884 --> 08:31.428
and get me another beer.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.887
- Okay.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.599
- Wait, wasn't the fridge
supposed to arrive today?

08:36.641 --> 08:38.226
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
don't worry about that.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.729
Sounds like work is
stressing you out, Mayan.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.147
You know what?

08:42.188 --> 08:45.025
I got something
that'll make you feel better.

08:45.066 --> 08:49.112

- Wow.
- Oh, man.

08:57.412 --> 09:00.331
I didn't know I had that in me.
I guess I got that from you.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.083
- You didn't get that throwing
the hammer down thing from me.

09:02.125 --> 09:05.378
You got it from your mom.
Ta loca. I'm scared of you.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.629
Put that in the truck.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.257
<i>* *</i>

09:09.299 --> 09:11.384
- Chance and your dad
are all tucked in.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.678
George was a bit tipsy.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.055
- How could you tell?

09:15.096 --> 09:19.225
- Well, after we cheersed,
he said, "I love you."

09:19.267 --> 09:21.644
- Baby, pretty sure he was
talking about the beer.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.983
Thank you for being okay
with all this.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.402
- Well, he fought me about
getting his pants off for bed,

09:29.444 --> 09:32.072
but I feel like he's really
starting to trust me.

09:33.406 --> 09:37.118
- It's night--what the--
why are these lights on?

09:37.160 --> 09:38.661
That's crazy.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.413
This one too.

09:40.455 --> 09:44.292
What--hey, why are all
the lights on in this house?

09:47.212 --> 09:50.256
- Why don't you bother
to knock?

09:50.298 --> 09:52.425
- Do you guys even know
what electricity costs?

09:52.467 --> 09:54.135
- 19.90¢ a kilowatt.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.512
Sorry.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.305
When I get nervous,
I say facts.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.392
- We can afford
the lights, Dad.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.394
I leave them on
in case Chance wakes up

10:02.435 --> 10:03.520
and has to use the bathroom.

10:03.561 --> 10:04.896
- You're a young couple, okay?

10:04.938 --> 10:06.815
You don't know when you're
gonna need that money,

10:06.856 --> 10:08.858
so both of you need to do--
you need to train Chance

10:08.900 --> 10:11.152
how to see in the dark.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.573
- I'm sorry. What?

10:15.615 --> 10:18.785
- When I was little, I would
read with the light on,

10:18.827 --> 10:20.745
and my grandmother would
turn the light off on me

10:20.787 --> 10:21.996
and she would say,

10:22.038 --> 10:23.957
"You need to learn
how to read in the dark,"

10:23.998 --> 10:25.875
so I did, and not only that,

10:25.917 --> 10:28.211
I still do it to this very day.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.257
- Really?
- "Read in the dark."

10:32.298 --> 10:34.092
He doesn't even read
in the light.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.973
- Don't come running to me when
you don't have anything left.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.725
I still got the first penny
I ever made.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.101
I use it as a fuse.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.230
What happened to my pants?

10:51.568 --> 10:53.778
- I swear it was consensual.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.832
- Don't judge me.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.000
- I'm not.

11:07.042 --> 11:08.835
I'm jealous of you. Hit me.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.672
- Man, these last few days
with my dad

11:12.714 --> 11:14.215
and his frickin' lights.

Oh, burning!

11:32.776 --> 11:34.319
Oh, Dad, can you
turn off the lights?

11:34.361 --> 11:36.988
- No, I like to leave them on
when I watch a movie.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.365
It helps me see it better.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.037
- I just want
to scream in his face,

11:44.079 --> 11:45.789
but that's pre-therapy Mayan.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.125
I just want my dad in my life

11:49.167 --> 11:51.252
and Chance to know
his grandfather.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.713
So for now, salud.

Dad!

12:15.819 --> 12:16.945
- What happened?

12:16.986 --> 12:18.780
- You shut
the lights off on me,

12:18.822 --> 12:20.782
and now I think
my ass is broken.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.451
- No, you're like your mom.

You got enough cushion
back there to survive

12:25.036 --> 12:27.122

12:30.208 --> 12:32.585
I'm done being disrespected
by you in my home.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.045
- Technically, it's my house.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.922
My mom gave it to me,
and I gave it to you.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.424
- You didn't even want it.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.092
You were trying
to default on the mortgage

12:39.134 --> 12:41.094

into a senior home

- But when she did,
I took over the mortgage.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.231
I'm paying for this house,
not you.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.358
And why isn't the kitchen done?

12:55.400 --> 12:57.193
- I told you.
The fridge is on back order.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.945
- Then order a different one.

- It's not possible.

your credit card,

13:12.584 --> 13:15.337
and I'll change the order.

13:15.378 --> 13:18.798
- There is no order
because I couldn't afford it.

I put everything
on my credit cards,

13:20.467 --> 13:22.886

you had everything covered.

13:24.846 --> 13:26.348

Let me guess.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.270
You spent it all
on your favorite things.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.271
- Don't do that.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.566
- Gambling, women,

13:36.608 --> 13:37.859
That's just great, Dad.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.152
You let me down again.

13:39.194 --> 13:41.654
- Let you down?
Come on. I was a good dad.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.323
I was a good provider
for you and your mom.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.784
- Oh, yeah.
You were a really good dad.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.327

that you left me

13:47.369 --> 13:48.870
in the fountain
in front of the casino

13:48.912 --> 13:50.580
and told me
it was the kiddie pool?

to swim and count change.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.962
Anyway, what right do you have
to complain?

13:58.004 --> 13:59.172
You had a dad.

13:59.214 --> 14:00.340
My dad was out
before I was even born.

for how you treat me.

act like a bitch.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.182

you just said that.

You know, I don't need this.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.603

14:13.645 --> 14:14.688
So leave.

I lost my house.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.316
- Oh, my God, how?

15:00.358 --> 15:02.902
- Because of the pandemic.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.571
I lost 50% of my business.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.699
I sold my house so the workers
could feed their kids.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.325
My cards are maxed out.

while I'm down, are you?

15:15.457 --> 15:19.127
- Honey, I wouldn't do that...
right now.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.173
- I was ashamed to tell Mayan
'cause I don't want her

15:23.214 --> 15:24.424
to lose respect for me.

15:24.466 --> 15:28.303
- Oh, honey.
Mayan's never respected you.

15:31.598 --> 15:35.894
Ay, George, there's no shame
in falling on hard times.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.022
You worked so hard to take
care of us for all those years.

15:39.064 --> 15:42.108
There was always a roof over
our heads, food on the table,

15:42.150 --> 15:43.526
even if it was the same deal

15:43.568 --> 15:45.653
for those hoochies
you cheated on me with.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.989
- Just the one that threatened
to take me to Judge Joe Brown.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.158
- [laughs]

15:50.200 --> 15:52.285
The truth is,

15:52.327 --> 15:56.122
Mayan doesn't care
about gifts and money.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.458
She just wants you
to be her dad,

15:58.500 --> 16:00.168
but that means that you have
to be honest with her

16:00.210 --> 16:01.670

Rosie, I don't know
if I can do that.

find a way,

16:13.348 --> 16:15.183
then you're never going to have
a close relationship

16:15.225 --> 16:16.685

Such a waste of money.

they always buy?

so there's a boarding fee.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.797

before my sound bath was over,

16:45.839 --> 16:47.465

Pay up, Jana,
or Duchess hits the floor!

16:52.262 --> 16:54.764

She's terrified of the floor.

16:54.806 --> 16:56.766
This is not right.
