00:00.078 --> 00:02.677
<i>Zorn! We need you.
Vulchazor has been on a rampage!</i>

00:02.713 --> 00:04.512
<i>First he sacked the
Plains of Doom, then sh...</i>

00:04.548 --> 00:06.548
<i>He took the Screaming Valley.</i>

00:06.583 --> 00:08.550
No, that's so close
to the Blood Forest.

00:08.585 --> 00:12.087
<i>You mean Lord Vulchazor's Blood
Forest golf course and spa!</i>

00:12.122 --> 00:13.255
<i>'Cause that's what it's called</i>

00:13.290 --> 00:15.790
<i>since he conquered it
last month.</i>

00:15.826 --> 00:17.826
<i>He's going to take
all of Zephyria, Zorn.</i>

00:17.861 --> 00:19.394
<i>Come back and fight with us!</i>

00:19.429 --> 00:21.463
Nah, it's okay.
You got things under control.

00:21.498 --> 00:23.431
Ah, besides,
I'm past all that now.

00:23.467 --> 00:25.100
Battling is a young warrior's game,

00:25.135 --> 00:26.935
and you know I'm loving my life
out here in the O.C.

00:26.970 --> 00:28.436
Got my son.
Got my girl.

00:28.472 --> 00:31.273
Satellite TV.
Got a rocking tan.

00:31.308 --> 00:32.807
You know they have
a cupcake ATM out here?

00:32.843 --> 00:34.242
Zorn! Hang up the phone.

00:34.278 --> 00:35.610
We're trying
to get married here.

00:35.646 --> 00:38.046
<i>Please, I have a family!
I'll tell you where they are</i>

00:38.081 --> 00:39.948
<i>if you just let me live...</i>

00:44.121 --> 00:46.354
Well, looks like
my friend's dead,

00:46.390 --> 00:48.462
so we can do your thing now.

00:52.030 --> 00:54.617
<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0

00:54.818 --> 00:58.753
<i>Wow, You're really getting rid
of all this stuff, Zorn?</i>

00:58.789 --> 01:00.321
<i>The Stone of Sight,</i>

01:00.357 --> 01:02.657
<i>MechaZorn,
all your invisible spikes.</i>

01:02.692 --> 01:05.360
<i>Yeah, well, you know, now
that I'm leaving behind</i>

01:05.394 --> 01:07.228
all things Zephyria,
I really just don't need it.

01:07.264 --> 01:09.597
How much for this
rustic walking stick?

01:09.633 --> 01:12.300
That's not a walking stick.
That's the Staff of Quiv.

01:12.335 --> 01:14.602
<i>Wait a second, Dad,
you're selling the Staff of Quiv?</i>

01:14.638 --> 01:15.804
You know I saw you
kissing it once

01:15.839 --> 01:16.905
when you thought
no one was watching.

01:16.940 --> 01:18.440
Oh, I knew you were watching.

01:18.475 --> 01:19.541
And that's a mistake, by the way.

01:19.576 --> 01:20.909
The Staff of Quiv, not for sale.

01:20.944 --> 01:22.377
<i>Oh, really?
Why not, Zorn?</i>

01:22.412 --> 01:24.312
I mean, if you're committing
to Orange County,

01:24.347 --> 01:26.714
and getting rid
of all your warrior stuff.

01:26.750 --> 01:28.817
Yeah, but the Staff of Quiv
is just too powerful,

01:28.852 --> 01:31.519
even for someone as boring
and lame as Craig.

01:31.555 --> 01:34.355
Eh, but I guess
he is family now.

01:34.391 --> 01:36.724
- All right, 50 bucks.
- Sold!

01:36.760 --> 01:40.895
You and me are going for a walk.

01:42.466 --> 01:44.632
Hey, Alan, look at
all your dad's old outfits.

01:44.668 --> 01:47.135
Scuba Zorn, Snow Zorn...

01:47.170 --> 01:49.737
Oh, Alan, look.
Formal Zorn.

01:49.773 --> 01:52.440
This is your father's
Zephyrian tuxedo.

01:52.476 --> 01:53.808
I think you should keep it,

01:53.844 --> 01:56.911
and I don't know, maybe even
wear it to the prom?

01:56.947 --> 01:59.131
Uh, yeah, you know, as much
as I'd love to wear dad's

01:59.132 --> 02:01.316
used silk loincloth in
front of the entire school,

02:01.351 --> 02:05.453
the only person I want to go to
prom with is Layla, and she hates me.

02:05.489 --> 02:06.788
- Oh, I'm sure she doesn't hate you.
- Yeah.

02:06.823 --> 02:08.223
Uh, no, pretty sure she does.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.058
After I ditched her
for the entire football team,

02:10.092 --> 02:11.793
and then shattered
that kid's pelvis,

02:11.828 --> 02:13.328
she said she never wants
to talk to me ever again.

02:13.363 --> 02:16.197
I forgot that you did that.
That was so dumb.

02:16.233 --> 02:19.100
- Thanks, Craig.
- Hey, son, if you want to impress a girl,

02:19.136 --> 02:20.935
you just got to make
a big gesture, that's all.

02:20.971 --> 02:23.004
Like when I wanted to
impress Upside-Down Woman.

02:23.039 --> 02:25.006
I took the shackles
off her ankles,

02:25.041 --> 02:26.474
and she was right-side up
for the first time in her life,

02:26.510 --> 02:28.076
and she loved it.

02:28.111 --> 02:30.778
Oh, yeah, maybe a grand
gesture would work.

02:30.814 --> 02:32.113
Hey, Alangulon, if
you're gonna go to prom,

02:32.149 --> 02:33.148
you're probably
gonna have sex, right?

02:33.183 --> 02:36.251
So, we should, uh,
maybe have a little chitchat

02:36.286 --> 02:37.886
about the birds and bees, hmm?

02:37.921 --> 02:40.288
Dad! You know, I have health
class and the Internet, so...

02:40.323 --> 02:41.890
I just don't want you
to become a teen dad, you know?

02:41.925 --> 02:44.726
- There's nothing more tragic...
- Uh, whoopsies. Ooh.

02:44.761 --> 02:47.395
<i>Kill everyone.</i>

02:48.665 --> 02:52.333
Hey, a little FYI,
those demons aren't being sarcastic.

02:52.369 --> 02:54.869
<i>Sorry, Nurse, I was just wondering,
'cause I don't see them there.</i>

02:54.905 --> 02:57.438
- I love Nurse Jackie.
- Shh, shh.

02:57.474 --> 02:58.773
She's hiding pills.

02:58.808 --> 03:00.208
<i>- Hey, Linda.
- Shut up, Todd.</i>

03:00.243 --> 03:03.428
Hey, Zorn.
Uh, I'm gonna be going off

03:03.429 --> 03:06.548
to do some corporate training
with the CEO for a couple days.

03:06.583 --> 03:08.816
I'm sorry, Todd.
Will you shut up?

03:08.852 --> 03:12.053
Uh, Linda, I was wondering
since you do have experience

03:12.088 --> 03:14.722
at being the boss,
maybe you could handle

03:14.758 --> 03:15.890
anything that came up?

03:15.926 --> 03:17.625
<i>Oh, sure, Todd.</i>

03:17.661 --> 03:20.328
I relish the opportunity to do the job

03:20.363 --> 03:23.464
I did for a decade
before you replaced me.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.971
Great, and we can "ketchup"
when I get back.

03:27.604 --> 03:33.921
'Cause you had said "relish,"
so I, uh, decided to do "ketchup."

03:34.711 --> 03:38.913
- Okay.
- Linda, this is your chance to get Todd

03:38.949 --> 03:40.782
out of here and regain power.

03:40.817 --> 03:43.318
I mean, in two days, we can
make this company so rich

03:43.353 --> 03:45.253
they'll have to put you
back in charge,

03:45.288 --> 03:46.988
and then you'll be a man again,

03:47.023 --> 03:49.257
and we can try some stuff
I've been curious about.

03:49.292 --> 03:53.294
I suppose if we make some big
sales that would impress the CEO.

03:53.330 --> 03:54.896
Hey, that's not
a bad idea, Zorn.

03:54.931 --> 03:56.831
Hey, screw you.
Oh, wait, hold on.

03:56.866 --> 03:59.801
"Not a bad idea."
Not... a bad...

03:59.836 --> 04:03.071
Okay, so it's... so a good idea.
You think it's a good idea.

04:03.106 --> 04:05.540
Gosh, you're pretty.

04:07.444 --> 04:09.010
♪ Layla ♪

04:09.045 --> 04:12.714
♪ Going to prom with you
would make my day-la ♪

04:12.749 --> 04:16.687
- # Everyone stop ca-calling me gay... #
- Please, stop.

04:16.795 --> 04:18.886
Sorry. It is, like, almost
impossible to write a song

04:18.922 --> 04:22.031
around the name Layla, so...

04:23.960 --> 04:27.662
Hey.
Gather around, gather around.

04:27.731 --> 04:30.465
Okay.
Uh, are you gonna answer?

04:30.500 --> 04:32.100
'Cause it's kind of awkward here.

04:32.135 --> 04:35.169
You know, you care way too much
about what people think.

04:35.205 --> 04:36.704
Oh, man, I can't wait until...

04:36.740 --> 04:38.172
she's-she's definitely
gonna say yes.

04:38.208 --> 04:40.475
Can't wait to hear that yes.

04:40.510 --> 04:42.076
She said no.
Uh, she hates me.

04:42.112 --> 04:43.745
- I called that.
- So, I think I'm gonna

04:43.780 --> 04:46.134
- look into changing schools.
- Wait, Alan.

04:46.169 --> 04:49.517
- I'm gonna go talk to him.
- Oh, poor Alan.

04:49.552 --> 04:52.153
Nobody should be sad
on their prom night.

04:52.188 --> 04:55.323
In fact, that was my first royal
decree when I was prom king.

04:55.358 --> 04:57.392
Wait, hold on.
Proms have kings and queens?

04:57.427 --> 04:58.893
That's just like Zephyria.

04:58.928 --> 05:00.862
Or like it would have been
if Vulchazor hadn't just

05:00.897 --> 05:04.232
wiped out the entire royal line
at the... wait, focus, Zorn.

05:04.267 --> 05:05.967
Come on, keep your head
in the parenting game, man.

05:06.002 --> 05:08.036
- Come on, come on...
- Oh, hey, I got it!

05:08.071 --> 05:10.538
What if we helped Alangulon
become this, uh, King of Prom?

05:10.573 --> 05:13.542
Yeah, you know, if Alan was king,
I bet Layla would

05:13.543 --> 05:15.710
realize how great he is
and get back with him.

05:15.745 --> 05:18.913
So, you and me,
father and stepfather,

05:18.948 --> 05:20.815
mortal enemies since
the dawn of time,

05:20.850 --> 05:23.584
will team up to make a king.

05:23.620 --> 05:27.388
Sweet Pippa Middleton,
we are halfway to a royal wedding.

05:27.424 --> 05:31.125
To King Alangulon, Son of Zorn,
Ruler of Prom

05:31.161 --> 05:36.564
and the Gymnasium
Where Prom... Is Gonna Be Held!

05:36.599 --> 05:38.700
I don't think Layla is ever
gonna like me again.

05:38.735 --> 05:40.702
She thinks all I care about
is being popular.

05:40.737 --> 05:43.738
What on earth would give her the
idea that you could be popular?

05:43.773 --> 05:45.406
- Uh...
- I'm sorry.

05:45.442 --> 05:48.176
I just didn't think being cool
was ever on your radar.

05:48.211 --> 05:49.977
Yeah, I didn't want to be popular.

05:50.013 --> 05:52.947
It just happened and I guess
I just sort of enjoyed it.

05:52.982 --> 05:55.416
Mm, I know that feeling.
One time I was at a party,

05:55.452 --> 05:57.719
and I took what I thought
was an aspirin

05:57.754 --> 06:01.022
and it was not an aspirin,
but I liked it.

06:01.057 --> 06:05.226
Like... I really liked it.

06:05.261 --> 06:06.627
You know what,
maybe I need to show Layla

06:06.663 --> 06:08.429
how much I don't care
about popularity.

06:08.465 --> 06:10.231
- Hmm.
- How do I do that?

06:10.266 --> 06:14.469
Alan, do I look like someone
who's ever been unpopular?

06:14.504 --> 06:16.571
All righty, the first step
to making a king

06:16.606 --> 06:19.140
is eliminating all
of Alangulon's competition,

06:19.175 --> 06:21.642
which means we just have to kill
every other male in his school.

06:21.678 --> 06:25.313
The surprise is the best part.
I was extra shocked when I won,

06:25.348 --> 06:28.116
considering that I went
to high school with Matt Damon.

06:28.151 --> 06:30.518
Oh, this is so much easier in Zephyria!

06:30.553 --> 06:31.986
You know,
after you murder your rivals,

06:32.021 --> 06:34.239
you just fill out a king
application, then you do two

06:34.240 --> 06:36.457
rounds of interviews with the
council of elders. Boom, boom.

06:36.493 --> 06:39.894
Yeah, well, Fullerton Hills High
doesn't have a council of elders,

06:39.929 --> 06:42.130
but they do have
a prom committee,

06:42.165 --> 06:44.999
and they're always looking
for, uh, parents to volunteer.

06:45.034 --> 06:46.901
Maybe I could get us some info.

06:46.936 --> 06:49.270
Who would have thought
a real dad, a stepdad,

06:49.305 --> 06:52.073
- working in perfect harm...
- Synchronicity.

06:52.108 --> 06:53.819
- Synchron...
- Sync-rmony.

06:53.820 --> 06:55.531
- Harmony.
- Synchronicity.

06:56.071 --> 06:59.890
Hmm, which crown would look best
on King Alangulon?

06:59.925 --> 07:01.791
- Eh, probably this little tiny one on the right.
- Zorn!

07:01.827 --> 07:05.896
Why are you on
CustomCrownDepot.zef?

07:05.931 --> 07:07.931
We're supposed to be
selling soap today.

07:07.966 --> 07:11.534
I mean, other days, too,
but especially today.

07:11.570 --> 07:13.270
Oh, I was, uh, kind of
on a whole prom thing,

07:13.305 --> 07:15.739
but honestly, even if I was
going to help, what would I do?

07:15.774 --> 07:17.674
I know squat about soap.

07:17.709 --> 07:19.376
Hell, they don't even
have soap in Zephyria,

07:19.411 --> 07:21.711
and now I have to find people
to buy soap,

07:21.747 --> 07:23.280
which everyone already has,

07:23.315 --> 07:24.948
even though I'm from a place
that nobody has soap.

07:24.983 --> 07:28.218
So, I mean, you know.
What?

07:28.253 --> 07:29.619
Why are you staring at me?

07:31.276 --> 07:33.953
Zorn!
Oh, thank goodness!

07:33.988 --> 07:35.345
Our prayers have been answered!

07:35.380 --> 07:37.814
We could really use
your help here, old friend.

07:37.849 --> 07:41.051
<i>Vulchazor, and his army of
glombeasts have us pinned down.</i>

07:41.086 --> 07:42.419
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it sounds like

07:42.454 --> 07:43.920
a pretty fierce battle going on there.

07:43.955 --> 07:45.655
<i>- Oh, thank you.
- You know, I wish I could</i>

07:45.690 --> 07:47.957
defend you from Vulchazor,
but I left that world behind.

07:47.993 --> 07:49.492
<i>- What?
- What I can defend you from</i>

07:49.561 --> 07:51.094
is blood-caked floors.

07:51.129 --> 07:53.163
<i>- Huh?
- Nothing removes that greasy residue</i>

07:53.198 --> 07:55.331
like our industrial
foaming scrub.

07:55.367 --> 07:56.633
Now available in...

07:56.668 --> 07:59.035
<i>- lavender breeze.
- No, no, no, no, soap?</i>

07:59.071 --> 08:01.504
Zorn, we-we are
South Zephyrian mud people.

08:01.540 --> 08:03.039
Soap would literally kill us.

08:03.075 --> 08:05.642
Oh. Uh, well, um...

08:05.677 --> 08:08.545
Oh, wait a second.
I see what you're doing Zorn.

08:08.580 --> 08:11.247
<i>You're going to hide
inside the soap boxes</i>

08:11.283 --> 08:14.451
<i>and sneak attack Vulchazor.
Oh, very smart.</i>

08:14.486 --> 08:16.152
Um... yeah! Yes.

08:16.188 --> 08:18.354
Yeah, I mean, that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

08:18.390 --> 08:19.823
<i>Smart. Yes. Very smart.</i>

08:19.858 --> 08:21.424
A-And you know,
the-the more soap you buy,

08:21.460 --> 08:23.059
the better our chances are
at pulling this off.

08:23.095 --> 08:24.494
<i>Yes.</i>

08:24.529 --> 08:25.829
Hey, and we should probably
just go ahead

08:25.864 --> 08:27.430
and set up
a recurring monthly order.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.899
You know, to really throw
Vulchazor off the trail.

08:29.935 --> 08:31.334
<i>Brilliant idea!</i>

08:31.369 --> 08:34.837
Just get a bird to fly
an invoice here. Ta-ta!

08:34.873 --> 08:38.006
We're saved!

08:38.043 --> 08:39.109
Hey.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.711
- Yeah!
- Yeah, uh...

08:41.746 --> 08:42.941
That's on me.

08:42.976 --> 08:44.047
<i>Yeah, you know.</i>

08:44.082 --> 08:45.515
<i>I mean, I always knew
you were a sex machine.</i>

08:45.550 --> 08:47.917
- I had no idea you were a sales machine.
- Oh.

08:47.953 --> 08:49.519
Zorn, we got big problems
with the prom committee.

08:49.554 --> 08:51.321
Her name is Shannon, she's 17,

08:51.356 --> 08:53.690
and she's got a black belt
in hurting my feelings.

08:53.725 --> 08:56.526
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but did you ask her
if Alangulon can be prom king?

08:56.561 --> 08:58.027
Yeah, I did, and she was like,

08:58.063 --> 08:59.295
"Uh, why would I do that?"

08:59.331 --> 09:02.832
And I was like, "Because everybody
deserves a chance, Shannon."

09:02.868 --> 09:06.669
And she was like, "Uh, yeah.
Nice cardigan, black Flanders."

09:06.705 --> 09:12.041
And I was like, "That is mean
and racist, Shannon."

09:13.078 --> 09:16.646
So, anyways, I don't think
it's gonna happen.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.781
Ugh. This would be so easy
if I had my Zephyrian stuff.

09:18.817 --> 09:20.550
You know I'd just walk up
to Shannon, cut off her head,

09:20.585 --> 09:22.152
put a zombie parasite
in her neck hole,

09:22.187 --> 09:23.853
sew her head back on,
and then command

09:23.889 --> 09:25.288
Parasite Shannon
to make Alangulon king.

09:25.323 --> 09:29.225
Yeah, life's not that easy, I guess.
Case in point,

09:29.261 --> 09:30.793
look at this walking stick splinter.

09:30.829 --> 09:34.164
Oh, I'm an idiot. Of course.
We still have the Staff of Quiv!

09:34.199 --> 09:37.066
I mean, that's like a zombie
parasite without all the pesky,

09:37.102 --> 09:40.170
decapitating
and, uh, recapitating.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.739
To reiterate,
we cannot kill anyone.

09:42.774 --> 09:44.941
No. We don't need to.
We can use the Staff of Quiv

09:44.976 --> 09:46.743
to make everyone vote for Alangulon.

09:46.778 --> 09:48.678
Oh, and then maybe we can
use it to sell soap.

09:48.713 --> 09:52.015
Not now, Linda.
This is important. It's prom.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.250
I donated the Staff of Quiv
to Goodwill.

09:54.286 --> 09:56.352
- You what?!
- Edie, that walking stick

09:56.388 --> 09:58.955
was a real conversation starter
on my power-walking route.

09:58.990 --> 10:01.357
I'm sorry, Craig, but sometimes
we have to give away

10:01.393 --> 10:04.640
the things we love because
they control people's minds.

10:05.597 --> 10:07.063
And Zorn, why do you want it?

10:07.098 --> 10:09.465
I thought you'd given up
all things Zephyrian.

10:09.501 --> 10:11.167
I... have.

10:11.203 --> 10:13.436
I was just testing you
to see if you also gave up all,

10:13.471 --> 10:15.305
you know, uh,
Zephyrian magic items.

10:15.340 --> 10:18.074
And you passed, so uh, mazel tov!
Hey Craig, buddy,

10:18.109 --> 10:19.442
can I talk to you
outside real quick?

10:19.477 --> 10:22.013
- Yeah, sure.
- Come on!

10:23.848 --> 10:25.782
- This is not good, Zorn.
- No, I know.

10:25.817 --> 10:27.850
The Staff of Quiv
is far too powerful

10:27.886 --> 10:29.752
to be sitting on the shelf
of some thrift store.

10:29.788 --> 10:31.654
I mean, if it falls
into the wrong hands,

10:31.690 --> 10:33.823
it could be the end of Zephyria.

10:33.858 --> 10:36.326
And I'm under pressure from
the prom committee to deliver

10:36.327 --> 10:38.795
perfect place settings, and
Jessica won't because she's all,

10:38.830 --> 10:41.998
"Shannon will hate anything
we do, so why bother?"

10:42.033 --> 10:43.666
And they both refuse
to accept the fact

10:43.702 --> 10:46.773
- that we're way over budget.
- Oh! No, right.

10:46.808 --> 10:47.537
Right, right, right.
No, The prom needs money.

10:47.572 --> 10:49.505
That's, that's
what's important here.

10:49.541 --> 10:50.640
I'll tell you exactly
what I told Shannon.

10:50.675 --> 10:53.644
Proms are not free,
and my arms are a perfectly

10:53.645 --> 10:56.312
- normal length for my body type.
- Oh! Wait a second.

10:56.348 --> 10:58.014
I happen to know
of a company that recently

10:58.049 --> 11:01.183
came into a lot of money.

11:02.187 --> 11:03.886
<i>Luxury foam hand soap,</i>

11:03.922 --> 11:06.322
<i>antibacterial foam hand soap</i>

11:06.358 --> 11:08.825
<i>and instant hand sanitizer</i>

11:08.860 --> 11:11.794
<i>in tropical, citrus spice</i>

11:11.830 --> 11:13.496
<i>or fragrance-free.</i>

11:13.531 --> 11:15.164
<i>I hope you learned a lot</i>

11:15.200 --> 11:18.568
<i>about bathroom supplies
over the last 40 minutes.</i>

11:18.603 --> 11:21.771
<i>And remember, don't be part
of the sanitation problem,</i>

11:21.806 --> 11:25.255
<i>be part
of the Sanitation Solutions.</i>

11:26.564 --> 11:29.178
<i>♪ Tonight, I can have some fun... ♪</i>

11:29.334 --> 11:31.934
Ugh, this is so tacky.

11:31.970 --> 11:34.737
You guys are lucky I just got in
over my head borrowing money

11:34.773 --> 11:37.340
from the prom fund and needed
a last minute bailout.

11:37.375 --> 11:39.509
And hopefully you learned
a valuable lesson

11:39.544 --> 11:42.779
about respecting other people,
and their body shape.

11:42.814 --> 11:46.083
Shannon, for the record,
I love your sense of humor.

11:46.084 --> 11:49.152
No, truly. Dry, it's cutting.
Don't ever change. Okay?

11:49.187 --> 11:51.521
Now what do you say
we make Alangulon king?

11:51.556 --> 11:56.125
Fine, I'll make your loser son
prom king. All hail Alvin.

11:56.161 --> 11:58.361
<i>Well, this should prove
I don't care what people think.</i>

11:58.396 --> 12:01.597
Hey, everybody!
My mom is my prom date everyone.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.933
- Okay, give me... give me a kiss.
- Yeah yeah.

12:03.968 --> 12:05.001
Oh yeah. Perfect.

12:05.036 --> 12:06.035
There's Layla.

12:06.070 --> 12:07.203
Oh, oh, oh.
Hey hey.

12:07.238 --> 12:08.671
- What?
- You have a smudge.

12:08.706 --> 12:10.206
I'm not saying that
to embarrass you.

12:10.241 --> 12:11.274
You actually have a smudge.

12:11.309 --> 12:14.310
This is good.
Yeah.

12:14.455 --> 12:15.688
Uh, Layla.

12:15.723 --> 12:17.290
Hey, is that Layla?

12:17.325 --> 12:19.025
Yeah, I forget, is it,
uh, the cool new thing

12:19.060 --> 12:20.726
to have your mom
as your prom date?

12:20.762 --> 12:22.228
I don't know, Alan.

12:22.263 --> 12:24.297
Isn't wanting to be cool
kind of your thing.

12:26.301 --> 12:29.035
Yeah, look at me.
I'm just the coolest guy here.

12:29.070 --> 12:31.637
Right? Super cool guy.

12:31.673 --> 12:36.142
- Is that a smile I detect?
- Maybe. Hey, Mrs. B.

12:36.177 --> 12:39.078
What's the matter, you couldn't
get another guy to ask you out?

12:39.113 --> 12:40.713
<i>Well, that was promising.</i>

12:40.748 --> 12:41.748
Unless you think

12:41.749 --> 12:44.584
she's actually jealous
because I'm such a good catch?

12:44.619 --> 12:46.452
- No, you're my mom, remember?
- Yeah.

12:46.487 --> 12:48.804
- Yeah.
- That's right. That's right. Ooh.

12:49.257 --> 12:52.124
- Yeah. I like that.
- Yeah, do that. Keep it up.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.794
- She's my mom. Yeah.
- What? What!

12:54.829 --> 12:57.063
- I'm kidding.
- She's crazy.

12:57.098 --> 12:58.598
I'm kidding.

13:00.935 --> 13:02.168
Formal Zorn on the horn.

13:02.203 --> 13:05.171
<i>Zorn... Gosh.
Funny you should mention horns.</i>

13:05.206 --> 13:06.806
<i>We just got our payment
in from Zephyria.</i>

13:06.841 --> 13:08.407
Hey, that's great.

13:08.443 --> 13:10.476
I told you Zephyrians
are too dumb to commit fraud.

13:10.511 --> 13:13.679
<i>Yeah, and they're also too dumb
to use actual money.</i>

13:13.715 --> 13:17.116
They paid us
in 20 Zephyrian goats.

13:17.151 --> 13:20.686
And there was a note attached
to one of the goats' horns.

13:20.722 --> 13:23.656
It says "Help us, Zorn,
you're our only hope."

13:23.691 --> 13:26.626
And it's covered in bloody
child-size fingerprints.

13:26.661 --> 13:29.061
Oh. So you didn't
specify PayPal, huh?

13:29.097 --> 13:30.463
- No.
- Um, hey.

13:30.498 --> 13:31.664
We'll talk about that later.
Okay, bye.

13:31.699 --> 13:34.931
So pretty.

13:34.966 --> 13:36.900
Go on!

13:40.554 --> 13:43.955
- Edie. What are you doing here?
- I'm Alan's prom mom.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.924
- We're gonna make it a new thing.
- Nope.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.460
But we did come up
with a plan to win Layla back.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.563
I just have to convince her the last
thing I want to do is be popular.

13:51.598 --> 13:54.199
Um, y-you don't want Layla
to think you're popular?

13:54.234 --> 13:57.368
Hey, you know what?
This prom sucks.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.903
I say we get out of here, 
you know...

13:58.939 --> 14:01.539
All right, let's get this, uh,
prom king stuff rolling,

14:01.608 --> 14:04.642
because my friends are doing
all my drugs right now.

14:04.678 --> 14:05.844
No, no, no, no. Shut up.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.645
- Psst! Stop.
- Anyway, uh...

14:07.681 --> 14:10.821
- Shut up. Shut up, lady.
- I guess it's Alan.

14:10.914 --> 14:13.051
- Son of Zorn, or whatever.
- # Simply the best #

14:13.086 --> 14:15.587
No. Oh, no. That...
That's not me.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.555
- That's a mistake, no.
- # Better than all the rest #

14:17.591 --> 14:19.824
- What are you kidding...
- Are you kidding me? That's not right.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.359
<i>There's got to be,
like, a mistake here.</i>

14:21.394 --> 14:23.428
Oh... Layla?
# Better than anyone #

14:23.463 --> 14:25.430
Hey, hey, hey!

14:25.465 --> 14:27.632
Girl that Alangulan likes
whose name I forget. Wait, okay?

14:27.667 --> 14:31.135
I promise, he's a loser.
He's bad at everything.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.671
In fact, when he was a baby
he would cry after his own farts

14:33.707 --> 14:35.139
'cause they scared him.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.641
♪ I hang on every word you say... ♪

14:36.676 --> 14:38.443
Layla, please, stop!

14:38.478 --> 14:40.545
Whoa, okay, I don't like
any of this.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.514
I don't even want to
be up here. I don't.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.816
Trust me, I don't want him
up here, either.

14:44.851 --> 14:47.685
I just did it because his weird
dad and his sidekick made me.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.921
Ooh, cool! I guess I am
kind of your sidekick.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.490
Hey, Layla.
Look, okay,

14:52.526 --> 14:55.660
you are smart,
and funny, and beautiful,

14:55.695 --> 14:58.796
and you take care of your sister
and your depressed mom.

14:58.832 --> 15:01.933
And you still find time
to do those awesome collages

15:01.968 --> 15:03.835
about all your family issues,
and okay, I don't care

15:03.870 --> 15:05.470
what anyone here thinks
about me except for you.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.405
I don't even care
about this stupid crown.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.041
Ugh! My eye!

15:12.345 --> 15:15.613
Boo! You totally missed
his other eye!

15:15.649 --> 15:17.582
Okay, uh, do I need to continue
this social suicide?

15:17.617 --> 15:20.652
- No, no, you're good. Come on.
- # Simply the best #

15:20.687 --> 15:23.788
- Yeah.
- # Better than all the rest... #

15:23.823 --> 15:26.858
I don't care.
Boo!

15:26.893 --> 15:28.660
I got these, uh, flowers for you.
Huh? You can have them.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.162
- Thank you.
- Those are roses.

15:31.197 --> 15:34.098
No, no, no. Alangulon please,
wait... I never talked to you

15:34.134 --> 15:35.733
about the birds and the bees
and your two penises!

15:35.769 --> 15:37.302
I mean, I don't know
if you have an uppy-downy

15:37.337 --> 15:39.404
or a side-by-side?

15:39.439 --> 15:42.574
<i>Hey, thanks for giving me
so many chances.</i>

15:42.609 --> 15:44.542
Sorry about the whole
prom thing, and...

15:44.578 --> 15:46.044
and the football thing.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.546
And that whole thing in
the hallway, with the...

15:48.582 --> 15:52.483
It's okay. You're kind of
a dick when you get popular.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.986
But it's, like,
what are the chances

15:55.021 --> 15:57.891
of that happening again?

15:59.000 --> 16:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:12.339 --> 16:13.705
You're right.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.306
It's way better
with the goats watching.

16:15.342 --> 16:18.910
Hey, Todd.
You're, uh, you're back already?

16:18.945 --> 16:20.778
Yeah, I cut my training short
when accounting notified me

16:20.814 --> 16:23.081
of a $10,000 expense!

16:23.116 --> 16:25.283
Well, I mean, you know, we don't
know anything about that.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.651
Do we, Linda?

16:26.686 --> 16:29.621
Really? Because the memo
on the P.O. says,

16:29.656 --> 16:33.625
"Zorn's kid's prom.
Eat a fat one, Todd!"

16:33.660 --> 16:35.930
- Yeah.
- If it helps, Todd,

16:35.993 --> 16:38.429
my son got laid last night.
Can't put a price on that.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.664
Well, I mean you could,
but that'd be weird.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.634
And you are the boss now.
So, in a lot of ways,

16:42.635 --> 16:45.570
this is really a reflection
of your abilities as a leader.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.372
You're right.
I-I'm responsible now.

16:47.407 --> 16:52.744
And I failed. There's only
one honorable thing left to do.

16:52.779 --> 16:56.581
Todd, you're fired, buddy.

16:56.616 --> 17:00.269
It's been an honor serving you, sir.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.188
<i> Okay.</i>

17:04.156 --> 17:08.089
Psst. How long do you think
until he notices the goats?

17:08.943 --> 17:11.877
<i>From Washington,
I'm Lakshmi Singh. </i>

17:11.912 --> 17:14.880
<i>Its been six weeks since
Vulchazor's surge in Zephyria.</i>

17:14.915 --> 17:16.714
<i>Accounts of torture, looting,</i>

17:16.750 --> 17:18.550
<i>and insane cackling
have been reported.</i>

17:18.585 --> 17:20.652
<i>There still has been
no sign of the man</i>

17:20.686 --> 17:23.488
<i>- Zephyrians call their defen...
- So hey, where's Alangulon?</i>

17:23.523 --> 17:24.790
Oh, he's at the doctor.

17:24.825 --> 17:27.192
I assume it has something to do
with the goat meat you gave us.

17:27.227 --> 17:29.327
Oh, please, the odds of
a person getting sick

17:29.363 --> 17:31.530
from the same strain of
hepatitis those goats died from

17:31.565 --> 17:32.898
are astronomical, okay?

17:32.933 --> 17:36.368
Mm. You know, Edie,
we married too soon.

17:36.403 --> 17:39.638
Because I'm in love
with this Chablis!

17:39.673 --> 17:41.006
Oh.

17:41.041 --> 17:42.207
<i>- Pretty good huh?
- Mm.</i>

17:42.242 --> 17:43.542
<i>Cost 30 bucks. But hey.</i>

17:43.577 --> 17:46.111
I can afford it.
Because I am the boss again,

17:46.146 --> 17:48.747
and I'm dating the head
of Sanitation Solutions

17:48.782 --> 17:50.248
Zephyrian sales department.

17:50.284 --> 17:52.368
Uh, I still don't
understand how you make

17:52.369 --> 17:54.453
money when half of your
clients pay you with meat.

17:54.488 --> 17:56.088
Yeah, but we
sell the goat meat

17:56.123 --> 17:58.190
to the trolls who paid us
in cursed treasure.

17:58.225 --> 18:00.225
Witches take the treasure,
give us back the curses,

18:00.260 --> 18:02.060
which we sell to wizards
who pay us in bitcoin.

18:02.096 --> 18:04.696
So simple, and yet,
the best plans always are.

18:04.731 --> 18:06.631
<i>Hey, Alan.</i>

18:06.667 --> 18:10.068
- Are you okay?
- Uh...

18:10.104 --> 18:14.178
The doctor told me
something pretty crazy.

18:14.213 --> 18:17.269
Evidently, I...

18:17.304 --> 18:19.678
- am pregnant.
- You're pregnant?

18:19.713 --> 18:22.481
- Get out of my house, you whore!
- Zorn! Sit down!

18:22.516 --> 18:25.484
Uh, I'm sorry.
How? You are a boy, right?

18:25.519 --> 18:26.518
What? Yes!
Yeah, I'm a...

18:26.553 --> 18:29.402
Why does everyone always
ask that? Look, okay,

18:29.437 --> 18:31.211
I'm just gonna tell
you what doctor Klorpins said.

18:31.246 --> 18:33.625
This thing on my shoulder
is just an ingrown hair,

18:33.660 --> 18:36.294
and...
that I'm pregnant.

18:36.330 --> 18:38.530
You're 17!
You didn't use protection?

18:38.565 --> 18:41.266
- What were you thinking?
- Yeah! Alangulan, what the hell?

18:41.301 --> 18:43.401
You have shamed this family
for the last time.

18:43.437 --> 18:45.504
Uh, Zorn. We're not angry.

18:45.539 --> 18:47.139
Wait, we're not? Okay.
Got to be honest, Edie.

18:47.174 --> 18:49.574
Kind of following your lead here.
I-I don't know what to do.

18:49.610 --> 18:51.943
I'm sorry. Can someone please
explain what's happening here

18:51.979 --> 18:54.513
to the one person who doesn't
know what the hell is going on?

18:54.548 --> 18:55.780
Well, Linda, it's simple.

18:55.816 --> 18:57.516
When a Zephyrian man
loves a woman,

18:57.551 --> 18:59.584
sometimes one of the man's penises

18:59.620 --> 19:02.988
sucks a woman's egg out of her
uterus into the man's he-womb,

19:03.023 --> 19:04.890
where it is fertilized,
and then grows

19:04.925 --> 19:06.324
inside the man
until it's big enough

19:06.360 --> 19:07.926
to bite its way
out of the man's lower back.

19:07.961 --> 19:10.028
And then, birds and bees swarm
the mess left on the ground.

19:10.063 --> 19:13.498
Wait, what?
O-Okay, I got to sit down.

19:13.534 --> 19:14.633
It's good thinking.
Use that lower back

19:14.668 --> 19:16.201
while you still got it.

19:16.270 --> 19:19.847
Alan. Alan...
your back is gonna be fine.

19:19.882 --> 19:21.039
Everything's gonna be fine,

19:21.074 --> 19:22.908
because we're gonna deal
with this as a family.

19:22.943 --> 19:26.411
Oh, my God.
Layla....

19:26.446 --> 19:27.646
she's gonna be a dad.

19:27.681 --> 19:29.948
I guess I'm gonna be a grandpa.

19:29.983 --> 19:34.186
We're gonna be gran-partners
in crime.

19:34.221 --> 19:36.388
- I'm drunk.
- Yeah, yeah. Hey, you know what?

19:36.423 --> 19:38.023
This celebration's missing something.

19:38.058 --> 19:39.491
Right? Uh, balloons!

19:39.526 --> 19:41.393
You guys stay here.
I'm gonna go get some.

19:41.428 --> 19:43.895
Damn it.
Getting balloons was gonna be

19:43.931 --> 19:46.146
my excuse to rush out of here.

19:46.733 --> 19:48.200
Well, you've really done it, Zorn.

19:48.235 --> 19:49.968
You got a great job,
a smoking girlfriend,

19:50.003 --> 19:51.570
and now,
you're gonna be a grandpa.

19:51.605 --> 19:53.238
Tell you what,
on occasions like this,

19:53.273 --> 19:56.308
you just got to spring
for the custom balloons.

19:57.477 --> 19:59.945
<i>Hey! Whoa, Whoa!
Get off of me!</i>

20:00.013 --> 20:02.781
<i>Who are you?
My balloons!</i>

20:02.816 --> 20:05.250
So everyone else thinks
Dad's coming back, right?

20:05.285 --> 20:08.238
Of course he is.
Well, at least, he better.

20:08.273 --> 20:11.022
We're watching Southern Charm
tonight, and I wait for no man.

20:11.058 --> 20:14.326
I'm sure it's just taking
a long time to get balloons.

20:14.361 --> 20:16.795
I'm gonna get dessert.

20:17.965 --> 20:19.464
Whew, it's about time.

20:19.499 --> 20:23.034
That sack smelled like the
inside of a sack I used to pee in.

20:23.070 --> 20:24.502
God help you
if it was the same sack.

20:24.538 --> 20:27.239
<i>Oh, I assure you,
it's the same sack.</i>

20:28.508 --> 20:30.242
Vulchazor!

20:30.277 --> 20:32.177
Tell me.
Where's the Staff of Quiv?

20:32.212 --> 20:33.345
No, no, no!
I don't have it.

20:33.380 --> 20:36.581
No, I'm out of the game!
I had a very successful garage sale!

20:36.617 --> 20:38.583
- What? A garage sale?
- Yeah.

20:38.619 --> 20:40.385
- Oh, that sounds very believable.
- No!

20:40.420 --> 20:42.120
No, you... no, no.
You don't understand! My family!

20:42.155 --> 20:43.788
- Uh-huh.
- Let me go!

20:43.824 --> 20:45.123
You have to let me go!

20:45.158 --> 20:49.838
I sell soap now!
Soap!

20:51.538 --> 20:54.995
