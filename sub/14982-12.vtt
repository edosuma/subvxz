WEBVTT

00:06.482 --> 00:08.418
Kimmy, eat your food.

00:08.507 --> 00:10.981
What have you got
goin' on today, LJ?

00:11.081 --> 00:13.349
School and then
swim practice.

00:13.417 --> 00:15.485
Swim practice?

00:15.552 --> 00:17.253
You made the team.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.389
Oh, Lane Jr.,
that's great.

00:19.456 --> 00:21.257
I am so proud of you.

00:21.325 --> 00:22.825
Did you hear that, Lane?

00:22.893 --> 00:24.477
Come here,
little princess.

00:24.561 --> 00:25.995
Ooh.

00:26.063 --> 00:27.697
Yeah.

00:27.765 --> 00:29.265
Nicely done, son.

00:30.467 --> 00:33.202
What's the matter,
baby? Yeah?

00:33.270 --> 00:35.171
Hey, angel.

00:37.708 --> 00:39.909
Don't forget your lunch.

00:39.977 --> 00:41.177
Oh. Uh...

00:41.245 --> 00:42.445
Oh, that's right.

00:42.513 --> 00:44.530
I said that I'd give you
money to buy lunch.

00:44.615 --> 00:47.283
What's wrong with the sandwich
you just made him?

00:48.385 --> 00:50.353
Well, I--

00:50.421 --> 00:51.621
huh, LJ?

00:52.489 --> 00:53.556
Nothing.

00:53.624 --> 00:55.925
Well, all right, then.

00:59.930 --> 01:00.930
Thanks, mom.

01:00.997 --> 01:01.864
Mm-hmm.

01:01.932 --> 01:03.099
Bye, dad.

01:05.235 --> 01:07.170
Did you order that crib
like I asked?

01:07.237 --> 01:09.572
Uh, yeah, I wanted
to talk to you about that.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.774
Don't you think it's
a little too expensive?

01:11.842 --> 01:14.277
Let me worry
about the money, ok?

01:15.012 --> 01:16.028
Time's up.

01:16.113 --> 01:19.449
Daddy's gotta go catch
some bad guys now.

01:19.516 --> 01:23.069
Ohh. Yes, you're such
a good big girl.

01:23.153 --> 01:24.454
I know, precious.

01:27.124 --> 01:29.692
So I have to work
late tonight.

01:29.760 --> 01:30.860
Again?

01:30.928 --> 01:32.762
Yeah. I have
parent-teacher conferences.

01:35.399 --> 01:38.134
I'll try not
to work too late.

01:38.202 --> 01:39.802
You know, I think, uh,

01:39.870 --> 01:42.972
her diaper rash is
really acting up again.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.308
Are we out
of the cream again?

01:45.375 --> 01:47.810
No. No.

01:48.679 --> 01:50.379
Ok. Good.

01:50.447 --> 01:51.881
I'll leave you
to it.

01:51.949 --> 01:53.549
Ok. Have a good day.

01:53.617 --> 01:55.151
You, too.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:12.669 --> 02:15.371
Ok.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.139
All right. Ok.

02:17.207 --> 02:19.792
Mommy will be back
in 2 minutes, Kim.

02:19.877 --> 02:21.410
Just 2 minutes, ok?

03:01.451 --> 03:06.556
All I can tell you is that a man
and woman forced me from my car.

03:06.623 --> 03:10.526
He made me lie down
on the ground while she took Kim.

03:12.930 --> 03:14.830
Look at that lot.

03:15.832 --> 03:17.733
Go. Go.
You're trespassing.

03:17.801 --> 03:19.268
So, dad?

03:19.336 --> 03:20.369
Sergeant Lane Bradley.

03:20.437 --> 03:22.805
He's a rising star
at Bethesda PD.

03:22.873 --> 03:24.874
Get the hell out
of here, you vultures!

03:26.176 --> 03:28.844
He's already
accusing mum.

03:30.547 --> 03:31.814
Mum?

03:31.882 --> 03:32.982
Colette Bradley.

03:33.050 --> 03:34.850
She's a fifth-grade
public-school teacher.

03:34.918 --> 03:37.520
She's frightened...

03:37.588 --> 03:38.754
Guilty, and ashamed.

03:38.822 --> 03:42.391
Which is exactly
what I'd be if I just lost my baby.

03:43.594 --> 03:46.495
And was about to lie
to your husband about it

03:46.563 --> 03:48.698
and the world.

04:19.596 --> 04:21.262
Please. Please.
Give her--please.

04:21.331 --> 04:21.930
Give her some priva--

04:21.983 --> 04:23.417
who's the knight
in shining suit?

04:23.478 --> 04:24.778
Well, according
to the police notes,

04:24.846 --> 04:26.980
he's, uh, Dr. Stanley Heaton,
a family friend.

04:27.048 --> 04:30.350
When the mother found that the baby
was gone, she called this guy.

04:30.418 --> 04:31.852
What? She didn't
call her husband?

04:31.919 --> 04:33.587
She hung up after
about 3 seconds.

04:36.524 --> 04:40.794
All I can tell you is that a man
and woman forced me from my car.

04:40.862 --> 04:42.696
He made--

04:43.898 --> 04:45.265
well, there it is.

04:45.333 --> 04:48.435
Flat, controlled,
mentally rehearsed delivery.

04:48.503 --> 04:50.370
Yeah.

04:50.438 --> 04:53.006
Complete with dead,
still eyeballs

04:53.074 --> 04:56.476
trying desperately
not to give the game away.

05:00.181 --> 05:01.548
You see right there?

05:01.616 --> 05:03.650
She's more frightened
of her husband

05:03.718 --> 05:05.385
than what might have happened
to her baby.

05:05.453 --> 05:07.254
And the teenage son's
caught in the middle.

05:07.321 --> 05:08.488
Yeah.

05:09.357 --> 05:11.391
Go back
to the group shot.

05:15.630 --> 05:19.766
What kind of a doctor
do you think that is?

05:19.817 --> 05:20.834
My money's on shrink.

05:20.902 --> 05:23.470
I'd say he's more like a--

05:23.538 --> 05:25.672
I don't know. An ob-gyn.

05:27.442 --> 05:28.842
Really?

05:28.910 --> 05:31.645
Loker and Torres can bring us
up to speed when they get back.

05:31.712 --> 05:33.680
In the meantime,
we got a baby missing, all right?

05:33.748 --> 05:36.283
The police told us to stick our nose
into that family's business.

05:36.350 --> 05:37.451
Stick our noses into
their business--

05:37.518 --> 05:40.087
that's exactly
how they put it, yes.

05:40.154 --> 05:41.254
Where you two been?

05:41.322 --> 05:42.355
It's a Saturday.

05:42.423 --> 05:44.458
- And I was out of town.
- Bored.

05:44.525 --> 05:46.226
There's a video on
in the lab.

05:46.294 --> 05:47.160
Catch yourselves up.

05:47.228 --> 05:48.228
Where you guys goin'?

05:48.296 --> 05:49.896
Uh, by the time
we get back,

05:49.964 --> 05:52.632
I want Wallowski here with the mum
and the dad, all right?

05:52.700 --> 05:53.934
Clock's ticking.

05:55.369 --> 05:57.671
A gynecologist.
How did you know?

05:57.738 --> 05:58.839
Woman's instinct.

05:58.906 --> 06:01.641
That or it was on
the police report all along.

06:01.709 --> 06:02.943
Police report?

06:03.010 --> 06:07.614
About Colette Bradley,
Dr. Heaton...

06:07.682 --> 06:09.015
What about her?

06:09.083 --> 06:10.917
A baby goes missing
in broad daylight.

06:10.985 --> 06:12.853
And for all intents
and purposes,

06:12.920 --> 06:14.554
you were the
mother's first call.

06:17.625 --> 06:20.327
Colette Bradley
is a patient of mine.

06:20.394 --> 06:21.995
Was a patient of mine.

06:22.063 --> 06:26.733
Now, this is a
fertility clinic, right?

06:26.801 --> 06:29.136
Was she and her husband
having problems?

06:29.203 --> 06:30.804
Uh, Dr. Lightman,

06:30.872 --> 06:33.173
ever hear of
doctor-patient confidentiality?

06:33.241 --> 06:34.708
We were hoping that
you could tell us

06:34.775 --> 06:36.376
a little something about
the Bradley family

06:36.444 --> 06:38.411
before we go
talk to them.

06:38.479 --> 06:40.580
Well, I--
I can tell you this.

06:40.648 --> 06:43.884
Th-they don't deserve this.
It's a nightmare.

06:43.951 --> 06:46.086
The Bradleys
are good people.

06:47.054 --> 06:50.090
Why where you
her first phone call

06:50.158 --> 06:51.391
and not her husband?

06:51.459 --> 06:54.694
And why did she lie
about what happened to her baby?

06:54.762 --> 06:55.762
She didn't lie.

06:55.830 --> 06:57.864
How do you know?

06:57.932 --> 06:59.533
You don't know...

06:59.600 --> 07:00.767
Do you?

07:02.170 --> 07:05.472
But what you do know
is that she's capable of lying.

07:06.340 --> 07:08.708
Oh, and big time.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.377
Or is that
something covered

07:10.444 --> 07:13.280
by all that confidentiality
bollocks and all?

07:15.416 --> 07:17.984
We don't wanna
punish anyone.

07:18.052 --> 07:22.522
We just--we just--
we just want her back home.

07:23.758 --> 07:25.292
Well, the husband
is angled away from the wife.

07:25.359 --> 07:26.560
He won't even
look at her,

07:26.627 --> 07:28.395
which means he
doesn't believe

07:28.462 --> 07:29.963
a word she's saying.

07:30.031 --> 07:32.232
Was anything else
taken from the car?

07:32.300 --> 07:35.569
Colette mentioned Kim's blankets
were gone, bottle, too.

07:37.071 --> 07:38.038
You got here quick.

07:38.105 --> 07:39.839
I just texted you
20 minutes ago.

07:39.907 --> 07:41.875
Well, considering
the nature of the case,

07:41.943 --> 07:45.111
constable, I took
the liberty of burning rubber.

07:45.179 --> 07:46.413
Go easy.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.081
They're here
to help.

07:49.250 --> 07:50.517
Shall we?

07:52.286 --> 07:54.454
All right, then.

07:55.856 --> 07:57.991
Well, for what it's worth...

07:58.993 --> 08:00.060
I'm very sorry.

08:00.127 --> 08:01.461
Yeah.

08:01.529 --> 08:02.729
I can't even
imagine, really.

08:02.797 --> 08:04.698
Can we just
get through this?

08:04.765 --> 08:06.299
Yeah.

08:06.367 --> 08:08.568
So you know
what we do here?

08:08.636 --> 08:10.503
Yeah. It's been
explained to me.

08:10.571 --> 08:12.505
So you think
your wife's lying

08:12.573 --> 08:14.074
about what happened
to your daughter?

08:14.141 --> 08:16.343
Now, why would you say that?

08:17.712 --> 08:20.914
Well, you just said Wallowski told you
what we do here.

08:20.982 --> 08:22.649
No.

08:22.717 --> 08:24.651
Colette's got
no reason to lie.

08:24.719 --> 08:26.386
Well, you know,
you're a cop.

08:26.454 --> 08:28.989
You bloody well know
everyone's got a reason to lie.

08:29.056 --> 08:30.757
Right?

08:30.825 --> 08:34.660
I'm sure this is very
difficult for you, Colette.

08:34.729 --> 08:37.563
Are--are you trying to say you know
what I'm going through?

08:39.267 --> 08:41.601
Can you run me through
what happened yesterday?

08:41.669 --> 08:46.506
Uh, I already told the police
everything that I know, so...

08:46.574 --> 08:49.476
Mrs. Bradley,
the people who are looking for Kim,

08:49.543 --> 08:52.312
they need all the help
they can get.

08:53.381 --> 08:57.384
I need you to help me
to help them, ok?

08:58.753 --> 09:01.154
Colette would
never hurt Kimberly.

09:01.222 --> 09:02.989
Not the question.

09:03.057 --> 09:07.427
My wife would never do anything
to hurt anyone in our family.

09:08.863 --> 09:11.398
What? Not on your watch,
you mean?

09:11.465 --> 09:13.300
Over your dead body.

09:13.367 --> 09:15.468
Is that
how you talk to her?

09:15.536 --> 09:17.904
Is it?

09:17.972 --> 09:19.906
You get good results
that way, do you?

09:19.974 --> 09:23.376
They were both in
their late twenties, early thirties.

09:23.444 --> 09:25.412
She wore
a red sweatshirt,

09:25.479 --> 09:27.147
jeans, sneakers.

09:27.214 --> 09:28.782
Mm-hmm. And the man?

09:28.849 --> 09:32.819
Um, thin, uh,
Jean jacket, cap,

09:32.887 --> 09:34.187
blue eyes.

09:36.390 --> 09:38.091
And what did he say?

09:38.159 --> 09:41.761
He told me to get
down on the ground, and then--

09:41.829 --> 09:43.730
was the door open?

09:43.798 --> 09:45.532
She opened it.

09:46.467 --> 09:49.302
My wife needs direction, ok?

09:49.370 --> 09:52.105
I think you
can understand that.

09:52.173 --> 09:56.343
She--she can get
careless sometimes.

09:56.410 --> 09:58.345
Well, she said
that the 2 kidnappers

09:58.412 --> 10:01.181
came over to her car.
How is that careless?

10:03.784 --> 10:06.986
Does your wife know that you think
that she's a liar?

10:09.023 --> 10:11.391
Just relax
and try to remember.

10:11.459 --> 10:13.026
What happened next?

10:14.261 --> 10:16.963
Well--wait. He--

10:17.031 --> 10:18.198
I--

10:18.265 --> 10:19.532
what color did you say
her eyes were?

10:19.600 --> 10:21.735
Um, blue.

10:26.607 --> 10:29.476
You said
his eyes were blue.

10:31.645 --> 10:34.814
You didn't actually see
any kidnappers, did you?

10:34.882 --> 10:36.282
I--

10:36.350 --> 10:38.418
you don't even think
you saw kidnappers.

10:40.621 --> 10:43.456
What really happened,
Colette?

10:43.524 --> 10:46.226
Oh, my God.

10:49.997 --> 10:52.031
He's gonna kill me.

10:53.267 --> 10:55.034
Who?

10:58.572 --> 11:00.607
My husband.

11:12.299 --> 11:14.468
What is this?

11:14.512 --> 11:17.147
Well, this is your wife...

11:18.059 --> 11:20.527
Mother of your children.

11:23.631 --> 11:25.132
What did you say?

11:26.801 --> 11:28.435
Are you talking
to me? I--

11:28.503 --> 11:30.404
oh, don't mind me,
darlin'.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.639
Just thinkin'
out loud.

11:42.717 --> 11:44.084
Anytime you're
ready, darlin'.

11:44.152 --> 11:46.687
Anytime she's ready
for what?

11:46.754 --> 11:49.256
Does everything
that comes out of your mouth

11:49.324 --> 11:50.891
have to sound
pissed off?

11:50.959 --> 11:52.993
Eh?

11:53.061 --> 11:54.928
I mean, look at her.

11:54.996 --> 11:57.231
She's already terrified.

11:57.298 --> 11:59.333
Lane...

11:59.400 --> 12:00.868
Hmm?

12:00.935 --> 12:02.903
Lane, um...

12:03.905 --> 12:05.839
I'm so sorry.

12:05.907 --> 12:09.977
I, uh--I left Kim
in the car

12:10.044 --> 12:11.311
just--just for a minute

12:11.379 --> 12:14.314
so I could run in
to the store.

12:14.382 --> 12:15.566
You did what?

12:15.650 --> 12:16.884
I--I just--

12:16.951 --> 12:20.754
I--I left the car
out front, and I ran in.

12:20.822 --> 12:23.724
Wait a minute.
You--you left the baby alone in the car?

12:23.791 --> 12:24.925
She was sleeping, Lane.

12:24.993 --> 12:26.693
She--she was just asleep,
so I--

12:26.761 --> 12:27.694
- what?
- Easy.

12:27.762 --> 12:28.996
Easy. Keep your distance.

12:29.063 --> 12:30.898
I just had the painters in.

12:30.965 --> 12:34.067
My house, my rules.

12:38.406 --> 12:40.307
Where's Kimmy?

12:40.375 --> 12:42.709
I swear to God,
Lane, I don't know.

12:42.777 --> 12:43.944
Where is she?

12:44.012 --> 12:46.180
You have to believe me.
Please, please believe me.

12:46.247 --> 12:48.382
Give me
one good reason why.

12:48.449 --> 12:49.783
'Cause I believe her,

12:49.851 --> 12:51.518
and I'm the expert.

12:51.586 --> 12:52.686
You're the expert?

12:52.754 --> 12:54.688
So Kimberly,
she, what?

12:54.756 --> 12:56.723
She just
disappeared?

12:58.326 --> 13:01.094
I lied about
the man and the woman,

13:01.162 --> 13:03.530
but--but someone
did take her, Lane.

13:03.598 --> 13:05.432
Kimmy. Kimmy!

13:05.500 --> 13:06.633
But these people
think that

13:06.701 --> 13:09.269
whoever took Kim,
they're looking out for her,

13:09.337 --> 13:13.106
you know, which--
that's why they took the bottle and stuff.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.877
What store?

13:16.945 --> 13:19.479
What did
you need so bad?

13:23.351 --> 13:25.819
Diaper cream.

13:25.887 --> 13:27.821
I went to get
diaper cream.

13:27.889 --> 13:28.855
Diaper cream?

13:28.923 --> 13:30.891
I thought that you
would get angry

13:30.959 --> 13:32.359
if I told you
that we were out,

13:32.427 --> 13:34.728
so I just thought
I'd go to the drugstore and get some.

13:34.796 --> 13:35.729
You see?

13:35.797 --> 13:37.297
This is
what she does.

13:37.365 --> 13:39.433
She blames everybody else
for her screw-ups.

13:39.500 --> 13:40.801
Now it's my fault.

13:40.868 --> 13:43.604
And you were wondering
why she called Dr. Heaton

13:43.671 --> 13:45.105
in her moment of terror.

13:45.173 --> 13:47.107
Well, I don't have
time for this.

13:47.175 --> 13:49.042
I need to find
my little girl

13:49.110 --> 13:50.410
before she
turns up dead.

13:50.478 --> 13:52.846
Lane, that is not fair! You--

13:59.387 --> 14:03.690
she is our little girl, Lane.

14:04.892 --> 14:09.329
Well, with a little help
from Dr. Heaton, right?

14:09.397 --> 14:11.331
How do you know
about that?

14:11.399 --> 14:13.367
You just confirmed it
for me, mate.

14:13.434 --> 14:15.469
Yeah? Well, that's
none of your business.

14:15.536 --> 14:17.938
You got any idea
the kind of courage it took

14:18.006 --> 14:20.140
for her to admit
how she lost Kimberly?

14:21.409 --> 14:22.976
And when are you
gonna have the guts

14:23.044 --> 14:24.811
to admit your part
in all of this?

14:54.342 --> 14:55.509
Oi.

14:56.577 --> 14:58.545
You must be junior.

14:58.613 --> 14:59.813
It's LJ.

15:01.983 --> 15:03.383
I'm Cal Lightman.

15:04.719 --> 15:07.854
The cops hired me
to help find your little sister.

15:07.922 --> 15:11.458
Yeah, well, I hope you're
good at what you do.

15:14.462 --> 15:16.196
What happened
to your hand?

15:17.398 --> 15:20.033
Hurt it at soccer practice.

15:20.101 --> 15:22.569
My hands used to look like that
when I was your age.

15:22.637 --> 15:23.870
Do you
wanna know why?

15:24.772 --> 15:26.606
You pissed
a lot of people off.

15:26.674 --> 15:28.542
You see, that's good.
That's good, that.

15:28.609 --> 15:31.345
Yes, now we got a bit of
a back-and-forth going.

15:32.613 --> 15:33.947
So who'd you hit?

15:34.015 --> 15:35.082
No one.

15:35.149 --> 15:36.450
Really?

15:36.517 --> 15:37.934
He had it comin'.

15:38.019 --> 15:39.019
Oh, yeah? Why?

15:39.087 --> 15:40.387
'Cause he was
talkin' smack.

15:40.455 --> 15:43.423
About your family, eh?

15:43.491 --> 15:45.225
About your dad, the cop.

15:45.293 --> 15:47.894
No. About your mum.

15:48.863 --> 15:50.630
What'd he say about her?

15:50.698 --> 15:51.865
She's a teacher.

15:51.933 --> 15:53.867
What do you think
they say?

15:53.935 --> 15:55.068
Now, listen.

15:55.136 --> 15:58.205
You either answer
my questions like a grown-up,

15:58.272 --> 16:00.841
or I'll find my answers
my own way.

16:00.908 --> 16:02.275
Are we clear?

16:07.115 --> 16:09.816
So they taunt you
about your mum.

16:09.884 --> 16:11.084
So what?

16:11.152 --> 16:14.121
She teaches
at my school, ok?

16:14.188 --> 16:15.655
There are rumors.

16:16.891 --> 16:20.560
Rumors you're
deeply ashamed of.

16:20.628 --> 16:23.330
Your dad hear any
of these rumors, did he?

16:24.198 --> 16:26.433
I seriously hope not.

16:27.268 --> 16:29.102
What,
for your mum's sake?

16:32.273 --> 16:35.509
Why would anyone want
to take your little sister?

16:35.576 --> 16:36.643
I don't know.

16:36.711 --> 16:39.279
Probably to get back
at my dad for somethin'.

16:40.998 --> 16:42.883
He locks up
a lot of people.

16:42.950 --> 16:44.751
So even if he's got
nothing to do with this,

16:44.819 --> 16:46.837
you're gonna blame him
anyway. Is that right?

16:46.921 --> 16:49.122
Now, about that shame,

16:49.190 --> 16:53.093
rumors about
your mum and who, LJ?

16:57.619 --> 17:00.086
Thank you for seeing us,
uh, Principal Aston.

17:00.333 --> 17:01.400
Anything
I can do to help.

17:01.467 --> 17:05.470
I just been talking
to the other Bradley child

17:05.538 --> 17:07.472
that you sent home
early today.

17:07.540 --> 17:09.574
Yeah. Lane Jr. needs to be
with his family right now.

17:09.642 --> 17:10.642
I think
that's obvious.

17:10.710 --> 17:12.010
Or did you send him home

17:12.078 --> 17:13.878
'cause he was
throwin' his fists about?

17:13.945 --> 17:16.982
Mmm. He has problems
controlling his--

17:17.050 --> 17:19.451
his temper,
if that's what you're asking.

17:19.519 --> 17:21.502
What? Controlling his temper
with you, you mean?

17:21.587 --> 17:22.753
I beg your pardon.

17:22.821 --> 17:24.356
Well, you can
beg all you like,

17:24.424 --> 17:26.124
but you got
a kid in your school

17:26.175 --> 17:27.459
whose baby sister's
gone missing

17:27.510 --> 17:29.361
and who's having
to get into fights

17:29.429 --> 17:31.096
to defend
his mother's good name

17:31.164 --> 17:33.465
because of rumors
that are flyin' about.

17:34.333 --> 17:35.934
Wh-what are
you driving at?

17:36.002 --> 17:37.469
Is Mrs. Bradley
a good teacher?

17:37.537 --> 17:38.770
She's one of my best.

17:38.838 --> 17:40.272
Good in the classroom?
Oh, outstanding.

17:40.339 --> 17:42.107
And in the sack?

17:42.175 --> 17:44.876
Just say no if you don't know
the answer, Mr. Aston.

17:44.944 --> 17:47.012
Ok. Ok.
Th-that's enough.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.680
Um--ahem.

17:48.731 --> 17:51.883
Yes, uh, Colette and I met
outside school

17:51.951 --> 17:55.020
a few times over the last
few years, but--

17:55.088 --> 17:58.023
you and Colette have been having
an affair for a few years.

17:58.091 --> 17:59.724
Yeah, but did
it cross your mind--

17:59.792 --> 18:02.594
yes. Yes, of course
it's crossed my mind.

18:02.662 --> 18:03.628
That the baby
was yours.

18:03.696 --> 18:04.863
You didn't
practice safe sex?

18:04.931 --> 18:06.898
Ouch!

18:06.966 --> 18:09.701
That's a DNA test
I might never want to happen.

18:09.769 --> 18:11.636
Are you suggesting
that--that to avoid

18:11.704 --> 18:13.205
Lane Bradley
ever finding out,

18:13.272 --> 18:14.473
that--that I would,
um--

18:14.540 --> 18:15.757
kidnap the baby?

18:15.842 --> 18:18.276
You know, you gotta
stop doing that, mate.

18:18.344 --> 18:21.913
You really gotta stop doing that thing,
that clenching of the jaw.

18:21.981 --> 18:23.148
Dead giveaway every time.

18:24.617 --> 18:26.118
Yes, I'm scared,

18:26.185 --> 18:29.087
and, no, I'm not
proud of what we--

18:29.155 --> 18:32.224
but--but I did not
kidnap the baby.

18:32.291 --> 18:35.093
But you will come up
as a suspect,

18:35.161 --> 18:37.696
and Lane will find out

18:37.763 --> 18:40.599
that you've been having
an affair with his wife.

18:40.666 --> 18:43.068
So do you think
it's better

18:43.136 --> 18:45.971
if he finds out while
he's under investigation

18:46.038 --> 18:47.572
or at another time,

18:47.640 --> 18:54.279
when he's alone with Colette and
his service revolver?

19:00.720 --> 19:02.354
School principal
seemed too organized.

19:02.421 --> 19:05.023
This smells
spur of the moment to me.

19:05.091 --> 19:06.258
Coffee?

19:06.325 --> 19:08.260
Could murder
a cup of tea.

19:08.327 --> 19:10.262
Those the photos
I asked for?

19:10.329 --> 19:11.463
Yeah. Press conference.

19:11.531 --> 19:13.131
Dr. Heaton,
you already know.

19:13.199 --> 19:15.133
The rest are
cops and neighbors.

19:15.201 --> 19:16.368
Hmm.

19:17.436 --> 19:19.905
So what were you doin'
out of town, then?

19:19.972 --> 19:22.340
- I was on my way to meet--
- bored.

19:23.509 --> 19:25.343
You notice
something unusual

19:25.411 --> 19:27.579
about the cops
in this photo?

19:27.647 --> 19:28.813
Not really.

19:30.216 --> 19:33.185
You notice anything unusual
about the cops in this photo?

19:33.252 --> 19:35.854
Um, they're pretty much
all kind of hunks.

19:35.922 --> 19:37.622
Oh. That's what
Loker said.

19:37.690 --> 19:38.757
Hilarious.

19:38.824 --> 19:41.159
Uh, they're all there
for the father,

19:41.227 --> 19:42.661
not so much for the mother.

19:43.529 --> 19:44.796
Right.

19:44.864 --> 19:46.831
Well, obviously.

19:46.899 --> 19:48.133
Not really
surprising, though.

19:48.201 --> 19:49.968
I mean,
they are cops.

19:51.103 --> 19:52.737
What about this one,
Dr. Heaton?

19:52.805 --> 19:55.407
Mmm. He's no hunk.

19:57.210 --> 19:58.143
Excuse me.

19:58.211 --> 19:59.110
It was a joke.

19:59.178 --> 20:00.812
There's a missing baby,
Eli.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.147
Yes. I know
there's a--

20:02.215 --> 20:04.549
I'm ju--are you two
messing with me?

20:04.617 --> 20:05.784
He looks worried to me.

20:05.851 --> 20:06.751
I'm not worried.

20:06.819 --> 20:08.486
Why would I be
worried? I'm fine.

20:08.554 --> 20:10.355
Not you. The doctor
in the photograph.

20:10.423 --> 20:13.858
He looks worried
about the mother and father.

20:13.926 --> 20:15.026
Torres
tell you that?

20:15.094 --> 20:18.697
Right. Yeah.
Torres told me that.

20:20.333 --> 20:21.733
Did Torres really
tell you that?

20:21.801 --> 20:23.335
Absolutely.

20:23.402 --> 20:25.270
Good girl.

20:27.206 --> 20:28.506
Right.

20:28.574 --> 20:29.774
Anything else?

20:29.842 --> 20:31.076
Uh, Detective
Wallowski called.

20:31.143 --> 20:33.478
Colette Bradley will
be home within the hour.

20:33.546 --> 20:36.748
Right.
Cancel le beverage.

20:41.254 --> 20:43.722
Uh, tea or coffee?

21:01.741 --> 21:03.041
Hey, babe.

21:03.109 --> 21:06.911
Your boss, Aston,
called me,

21:06.979 --> 21:08.947
told me everything.

21:09.015 --> 21:14.152
And now you are
officially dead to me.

21:16.055 --> 21:17.822
We can fix this,
Lane, ok. We can.

21:17.890 --> 21:19.357
We just need to find
Kimmy first.

21:19.425 --> 21:21.593
What's going on, mom?

21:21.661 --> 21:23.695
How do I even know
Kimmy is my kid,

21:23.763 --> 21:25.063
with you whoring around
like that?

21:25.131 --> 21:26.398
How can you
even say that?

21:26.465 --> 21:27.666
Y-you know that
she's yours.

21:27.733 --> 21:29.668
Get out of my house.

21:29.735 --> 21:31.636
Hey, easy, LJ.

21:33.572 --> 21:36.041
Oi, LJ.

21:36.108 --> 21:38.143
Big tough-guy cop
like your dad standin' there

21:38.210 --> 21:39.644
with a beer
in his hand,

21:39.712 --> 21:41.413
yelling threats at
his wife and son--

21:41.480 --> 21:44.449
you take it
from me, mate.

21:44.517 --> 21:46.184
He's not worth it.

21:47.153 --> 21:49.354
Colette, LJ, come on.
Let's go.

21:49.422 --> 21:51.089
Come on.

21:53.926 --> 21:55.293
What are you doing here?

21:55.361 --> 21:57.562
We're tryin' to find
your baby, Lane.

21:57.630 --> 22:00.031
Yeah? Well, you're not
gonna find her here.

22:00.099 --> 22:01.099
Why's that, now?

22:01.167 --> 22:02.701
You got her stashed

22:02.768 --> 22:05.403
somewhere else,
have you? Eh?

22:08.307 --> 22:10.542
Well, that'll teach
the missis

22:10.609 --> 22:12.977
not to be
so careless.

22:13.846 --> 22:15.680
Get the hell
out of my house.

22:15.748 --> 22:19.084
Make me, officer.

22:20.252 --> 22:22.087
Hey. Lane!

22:22.154 --> 22:24.222
Knock it off.

22:29.028 --> 22:31.296
Ooh. Hello.

22:32.631 --> 22:35.400
You're gonna have
to do a lot better than that, mate!

22:40.200 --> 22:41.233
Hello, Willie.

22:41.301 --> 22:42.935
...Iam.
What?

22:43.003 --> 22:44.236
William.

22:44.304 --> 22:46.038
Oh, yeah. Right.

22:46.106 --> 22:47.573
Yeah.

22:51.118 --> 22:52.818
The Federalist Papers.

22:52.886 --> 22:54.787
Really?

22:56.023 --> 22:58.891
Is this what you two get up to
behind my back?

22:58.959 --> 23:00.559
Uh, no.
We make out.

23:00.627 --> 23:02.361
Thanks for that.

23:02.429 --> 23:03.596
You asked.

23:04.464 --> 23:05.531
I gotta get going.

23:05.599 --> 23:07.533
I have defensive-line
practice in the morning.

23:07.601 --> 23:10.269
Ok. Uh, thanks for the help.
Same time tomorrow?

23:10.337 --> 23:12.705
Sure, if that's cool
with your dad.

23:13.674 --> 23:15.775
Why did I have
to have a daughter?

23:15.842 --> 23:18.477
Uh, you know, actually,
come over an hour earlier.

23:18.545 --> 23:19.679
We can make out.

23:19.746 --> 23:21.747
A lippy daughter.

23:21.815 --> 23:23.382
What are you
grinnin' at?

23:23.450 --> 23:24.583
You two.

23:24.651 --> 23:26.585
Heh. It's cool.

23:27.688 --> 23:29.288
Bye, then.

23:31.825 --> 23:33.159
William was
coaching me

23:33.226 --> 23:37.430
so I can take down this idiot
that's on the other debate team.

23:37.497 --> 23:38.664
Idiot?

23:38.732 --> 23:39.665
Mm-hmm.

23:39.733 --> 23:40.900
Sounds a bit personal.

23:40.967 --> 23:43.269
That's pretty rich
coming from you.

23:43.337 --> 23:47.239
I go up against a lot
of different people, em,

23:47.307 --> 23:49.041
but it's never personal.

23:49.092 --> 23:50.576
Boop.

23:50.644 --> 23:53.012
Never disrespect
your opponent, Em.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.081
Or your dad,
for that matter.

23:55.148 --> 23:57.950
So, I should just
bully them, then?

23:58.018 --> 24:01.187
I shake people up
until they lose control

24:01.254 --> 24:03.789
and forget to hide
their emotions.

24:03.857 --> 24:06.025
Not the same
as bullying at all.

24:06.093 --> 24:07.827
You really think I'm
disrespectful to you?

24:07.894 --> 24:09.161
You can't help it.

24:09.229 --> 24:11.130
I'm the authority figure.

24:11.198 --> 24:13.766
It's in your blood.
Don't argue.

24:13.834 --> 24:15.768
Bully.

24:21.074 --> 24:23.075
Thank you
for coming back in.

24:23.143 --> 24:24.677
Like I have a choice.

24:24.745 --> 24:27.079
Well, you have a brain,
don't you?

24:27.147 --> 24:29.415
We have unfinished business,
you and I.

24:29.466 --> 24:34.687
So how long have you known that Colette
was having an affair with Ben Aston?

24:36.423 --> 24:38.891
I found out
when Aston called me.

24:40.260 --> 24:41.727
All right.

24:43.864 --> 24:47.500
How long have you
known about the affair?

24:48.769 --> 24:52.638
That wasn't surprise
on your face at the house.

24:52.706 --> 24:58.244
So how long are you gonna make me wait
for the truth, Lane?

25:01.548 --> 25:03.949
Colette took
night courses.

25:04.017 --> 25:06.952
She, uh, stayed late
for conferences.

25:07.020 --> 25:08.621
You name it.

25:08.688 --> 25:10.022
I'm a cop.

25:10.090 --> 25:12.758
I know when
something's not right.

25:12.826 --> 25:16.395
And add to that
that you and Colette couldn't conceive.

25:16.463 --> 25:18.531
Which is how come
Dr. Heaton's

25:18.598 --> 25:20.533
involved in
all of this, right?

25:20.600 --> 25:23.369
Explain to me what
this has to do with finding my daughter.

25:25.205 --> 25:28.140
When your wife said
that the baby was yours,

25:28.208 --> 25:29.909
both of yours...
Mm-hmm.

25:29.976 --> 25:32.511
Even though you knew
she'd had an affair,

25:32.579 --> 25:35.014
you never questioned
that you were the father?

25:35.081 --> 25:37.983
Kimberly is
my daughter.

25:38.051 --> 25:43.055
When I made that crack about her
being the mother of your children,

25:43.123 --> 25:44.857
she tried to hide her shame.

25:46.193 --> 25:51.096
You are not the father
of both children.

25:53.366 --> 25:55.401
You ever wonder why
Kimberly doesn't look

25:55.469 --> 25:57.369
even the littlest bit
like you?

26:02.442 --> 26:03.876
Now you're wonderin',

26:03.944 --> 26:08.848
"well, if I'm not
Kimberly's father,

26:08.915 --> 26:12.785
what the hell is Heaton's
role in all of that?"

26:15.021 --> 26:18.123
You find that out,
you might find the baby.

26:21.661 --> 26:23.262
Morning, Dr. Foster.

26:23.330 --> 26:24.463
Satisfied customers?

26:24.531 --> 26:25.531
And their babies.

26:25.599 --> 26:28.234
Now, can we take this
in my office, please?

26:28.301 --> 26:29.235
No.

26:29.302 --> 26:30.503
Excuse me?

26:30.570 --> 26:31.804
No, we did that before,

26:31.872 --> 26:33.806
and it didn't
work very well.

26:35.008 --> 26:37.476
Is Lane Bradley
Kim's real father?

26:37.544 --> 26:41.313
Well, both their names
are on the birth certificate.

26:41.381 --> 26:42.781
Yeah, but you
can pretty much put

26:42.849 --> 26:44.350
anything you want on
a birth certificate, right?

26:44.417 --> 26:48.454
Lane and Colette Bradley
are Kimmy's parents, period.

26:48.522 --> 26:49.688
Parents.

26:49.756 --> 26:51.924
Yeah, as opposed to
mother and father.

26:51.992 --> 26:55.094
You know, that's a very carefully put
language distinction

26:55.161 --> 26:57.129
and technically
true. I mean,

26:57.197 --> 26:59.064
Lane and Colette
are raising her,

26:59.132 --> 27:02.368
even if they weren't
the biological parents.

27:03.637 --> 27:07.006
You got any kids
yourself, Dr. Heaton?

27:08.108 --> 27:10.676
I'll take that
as a no, then.

27:12.612 --> 27:18.317
Yet somehow you think
of all of these babies as yours,

27:18.385 --> 27:19.985
you know, in a way.

27:20.053 --> 27:21.921
A kind of substitute
parenthood.

27:21.988 --> 27:24.957
Well, no one
would argue with that.

27:25.025 --> 27:26.825
If you don't mind, please...

27:26.893 --> 27:31.997
Do any of your patients ever get
the wrong sperm?

27:33.199 --> 27:35.568
Ms. Tate. I'm--I'm sorry.
I'll be--

27:38.338 --> 27:41.874
I'm not gonna talk about this
any further out here.

27:43.376 --> 27:48.347
I mean, do they ever
get it mixed up, you know,

27:48.415 --> 27:50.149
accidentally?

27:53.286 --> 27:56.088
Ok, how 'bout intentionally?!

28:06.600 --> 28:09.935
Lane Bradley isn't
Kim's biological father.

28:10.003 --> 28:12.371
Of course he's the father.
I did the work myself.

28:12.439 --> 28:13.939
Well, how long did
the process take?

28:14.007 --> 28:15.908
And don't give us any
of that patient-doctor crap,

28:15.976 --> 28:17.710
or we'll take this
back out there.

28:22.349 --> 28:23.682
5 years.

28:23.750 --> 28:26.852
The process to get them
pregnant took 5 years.

28:26.920 --> 28:29.655
Right. Thank you.

28:31.157 --> 28:32.491
Next question.

28:32.559 --> 28:35.861
Would a doctor,
like you,

28:35.929 --> 28:41.934
help the process along
by making a little donation of his own?

28:42.002 --> 28:43.435
That's outrageous.

28:43.503 --> 28:44.570
It's disgusting, yeah.

28:44.638 --> 28:47.539
You get a lot of cards
from your patients.

28:47.607 --> 28:49.108
More than I can count.

28:49.175 --> 28:51.644
It's funny, though.

28:51.711 --> 28:56.148
'Cause you get a card
from the Bradleys, right,

28:56.216 --> 28:59.418
and it's the only one
that ends up in a schmancy frame,

28:59.486 --> 29:01.520
and it's their little girl
that gets taken.

29:01.588 --> 29:02.988
As you already know,

29:03.056 --> 29:04.990
we've grown
particularly close.

29:05.058 --> 29:10.062
We think that whoever
Kim's father is might have her.

29:10.130 --> 29:12.031
Lane is her father.

29:12.098 --> 29:15.300
I don't know how I can make this
any more clear to you people.

29:15.368 --> 29:18.537
Well, you could
say it again, all right,

29:18.605 --> 29:21.874
but this time, without squinting
and pressing your lips together

29:21.941 --> 29:22.941
and that.

29:23.009 --> 29:25.611
Lane isn't
the father.

29:25.679 --> 29:27.146
So who is, then?

29:28.014 --> 29:30.115
Let me guess.

29:30.183 --> 29:31.483
It's confidential.

29:33.119 --> 29:36.255
Whoa. This conversation
never happened.

29:36.322 --> 29:39.058
No, we got it all
from your face, mate.

29:39.125 --> 29:41.360
And from what
you didn't say.

29:43.797 --> 29:45.064
And your point is?

29:45.131 --> 29:46.398
Wallowski
found some video

29:46.449 --> 29:48.400
from a drugstore
surveillance camera.

29:48.468 --> 29:50.069
This is from
this morning,

29:50.136 --> 29:51.904
same drugstore Kim
was taken from.

29:51.971 --> 29:55.808
Lane Bradley goes in early
on his shift, and...

29:55.875 --> 29:58.577
He buys diapers.

29:58.645 --> 30:01.313
Get him in
the cube pronto.

30:08.455 --> 30:12.791
I know I'm not the best husband or dad
in the world.

30:12.859 --> 30:14.660
That's my part in this.

30:14.728 --> 30:17.863
You asked me when I was
going to admit that.

30:17.931 --> 30:19.465
Well, there you have it.

30:19.532 --> 30:23.068
But I am a good cop.

30:23.136 --> 30:26.972
That is, until the day when I stop
looking for Kimmy.

30:31.010 --> 30:35.214
We got video of you
buying diapers this morning.

30:35.281 --> 30:37.182
I always buy
diapers today.

30:37.250 --> 30:40.085
You got plenty of baby supplies
at home, Lane.

30:40.153 --> 30:41.320
Care to explain?

30:46.726 --> 30:49.061
He has to buy 'em.

30:49.129 --> 30:50.195
Don't you?

30:50.263 --> 30:53.132
So you can keep believing.

30:53.199 --> 30:57.236
Otherwise, you have to admit
to yourself that you've lost all hope.

30:57.303 --> 30:58.771
Right?

31:03.376 --> 31:07.646
Go get your wife and your son and
bring 'em back here.

31:08.648 --> 31:10.249
Gently.

31:10.316 --> 31:11.550
Ok.

31:11.618 --> 31:14.653
Wallowski will get
Dr. Heaton...

31:14.721 --> 31:15.888
Not so gently.

31:18.224 --> 31:19.291
Heaton's involved
in this?

31:19.359 --> 31:21.727
He's standing in the way
of the truth.

31:21.795 --> 31:24.730
You thank me when we get
your baby back.

31:36.669 --> 31:38.903
Yeah?

31:44.804 --> 31:46.505
What's the meaning
of this?

31:46.572 --> 31:50.142
Well, I think we're just
about to find that out.

31:54.146 --> 31:56.815
Mrs. Bradley,
have you ever had an affair

31:56.883 --> 31:59.151
with anyone else
other than your boss?

31:59.218 --> 32:01.319
What kind
of question is that?

32:01.387 --> 32:04.322
The kind we can't
help answering with our faces.

32:06.859 --> 32:09.227
So just one affair,
then?

32:10.630 --> 32:13.231
Stanley Heaton told you?

32:13.299 --> 32:17.335
No, but I take it
from that look that he knows

32:17.403 --> 32:19.504
and he's just
covering for you.

32:19.555 --> 32:22.240
I just want my baby back.

32:23.943 --> 32:26.545
Is your boss,
Ben Aston,

32:26.612 --> 32:29.181
the real father
of your baby?

32:41.360 --> 32:44.096
But he doesn't know
that he's the father.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.431
I never told him.

32:47.233 --> 32:50.035
As far as he's concerned,

32:50.103 --> 32:55.774
Dr. Heaton's fertility treatments with me
and my husband worked.

32:59.846 --> 33:02.280
All right,
so Colette came to you,

33:02.348 --> 33:06.284
and she told you that she
was having an affair with Ben Aston,

33:06.352 --> 33:09.187
that she thought that he'd
made her pregnant, right?

33:09.255 --> 33:11.623
She never told me
the name of the father,

33:11.691 --> 33:13.458
and I didn't
want to know.

33:13.526 --> 33:15.393
Tkk tkk.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.932
So there's no reason
to suspect

33:21.000 --> 33:23.285
that Aston may have
taken the baby.

33:25.238 --> 33:27.205
Colette, come on.

33:27.273 --> 33:29.774
You just said you
want your baby back.

33:29.842 --> 33:31.977
Simple answers to
simple questions, please.

33:33.379 --> 33:36.882
So you think it's Ben?

33:36.949 --> 33:40.886
Or anyone else who considers himself
a part of the family.

33:40.953 --> 33:44.189
We think whoever took your baby
had the key to your car

33:44.257 --> 33:46.158
or they knew
where the spare was.

33:46.225 --> 33:48.927
I keep the spare in the--

33:48.995 --> 33:52.964
in the junk drawer
in--in the kitchen.

33:57.236 --> 34:00.105
Well, that just opened up
a whole new line of thinking

34:00.173 --> 34:01.973
into who could
have done this.

34:02.842 --> 34:06.444
So in this one,

34:06.512 --> 34:09.281
you're sort of smilin'
at your dad.

34:09.348 --> 34:10.649
Am I?

34:10.716 --> 34:12.484
Yeah. Little bit.

34:12.552 --> 34:14.386
Just a little bit.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.188
If you say so.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.290
I don't see it.

34:19.358 --> 34:21.659
You ever seen
your dad cry?

34:21.726 --> 34:24.795
I saw your dad cry.

34:24.864 --> 34:29.000
I saw him cry today
when I questioned him.

34:30.335 --> 34:33.938
You see, there it is again.

34:34.005 --> 34:37.375
It's the same smile.

34:39.378 --> 34:40.978
You enjoy it, don't you?

34:41.047 --> 34:43.215
You enjoy seein' him suffer.

34:43.282 --> 34:44.916
Are you crazy?

34:49.956 --> 34:51.690
Restless leg
syndrome.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.428
See, I think you and I,

34:56.495 --> 34:59.231
I think we're startin' to understand
each other.

34:59.298 --> 35:00.465
You hate your dad,

35:00.533 --> 35:02.234
but you love your mum.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.642
Worst day
of your mum's life.

35:10.693 --> 35:13.278
The worst day.

35:14.847 --> 35:17.182
You won't even
look at her.

35:17.250 --> 35:18.183
No.

35:18.251 --> 35:19.417
No.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.120
I don't have
to talk to you.

35:22.188 --> 35:25.390
I already told you
you can't help talkin' to me.

35:26.659 --> 35:28.460
Don't you get it?

35:36.636 --> 35:40.739
So did you take her
just to hurt your dad?

35:45.211 --> 35:49.814
It's like there's no one else
in that family...

35:52.151 --> 35:56.254
Just him and
his princess Kimmy.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.923
Where is she?

36:05.931 --> 36:08.433
Didn't plan to take her.

36:08.501 --> 36:11.803
I was just walkin' to school,

36:11.871 --> 36:15.340
saw the car parked
outside the drugstore,

36:15.408 --> 36:18.376
and I got an idea.

36:18.444 --> 36:20.512
That's a lot
of bollocks.

36:20.579 --> 36:22.347
'Cause your mum's
spare keys

36:22.415 --> 36:25.350
were in the junk drawer
in the kitchen, right,

36:25.418 --> 36:27.252
so you did plan this.

36:29.121 --> 36:31.022
What'd you do to her?

36:32.591 --> 36:34.092
Did you kill her?

36:35.094 --> 36:38.263
Did you kill
a little baby

36:38.331 --> 36:41.900
just to stick it
to your dad

36:41.967 --> 36:43.802
once and for all?

36:49.595 --> 36:51.697
You want to stand up
to your dad,

36:52.796 --> 36:54.197
all right, you can
do better than this.

36:54.198 --> 36:55.365
Sit down, son.

36:56.734 --> 36:58.168
This hurts everyone.

36:58.235 --> 37:01.538
This hurts your mum,
hurts Kimberly.

37:01.605 --> 37:03.206
Sit down, son!

37:09.680 --> 37:12.015
Where is she?

37:13.985 --> 37:16.386
You don't know
what it's like.

37:16.454 --> 37:18.621
To have a dad
like him.

37:20.524 --> 37:24.461
All right, try this one on
for size, all right?

37:24.528 --> 37:26.663
3 nights a week, minimum,

37:26.731 --> 37:30.000
all right, he goes
straight from work to the bar,

37:30.067 --> 37:32.836
and when he does stumble home
in the middle of the night

37:32.903 --> 37:34.804
stinking of booze, right,
he's straight in the kitchen,

37:34.872 --> 37:36.606
and he's yellin'
at your mum, and he--

37:36.674 --> 37:38.808
you know, maybe he's
knockin' her about a bit.

37:38.876 --> 37:41.011
All right,
you can hear all this

37:41.078 --> 37:44.748
from where you are.
You're--you're hiding in your bedroom.

37:44.815 --> 37:46.983
All right, there's nothing
you can do about it,

37:47.051 --> 37:48.718
but you're just--
you're up there,

37:48.786 --> 37:50.987
you're layin' in bed,
and you're waitin'.

37:51.055 --> 37:54.057
You're waiting because
you know what's comin' next.

37:54.125 --> 37:57.060
See, there's footsteps
on the stairs.

37:57.128 --> 37:59.929
All right, and you given up
on God God knows when,

37:59.997 --> 38:03.800
but you're layin' there,
and you're praying...

38:07.271 --> 38:09.339
"Make it stop.

38:09.407 --> 38:12.375
Please make it stop."

38:16.480 --> 38:18.348
Sound familiar?

38:18.416 --> 38:21.051
Hmm?

38:21.118 --> 38:22.952
No?

38:28.359 --> 38:35.398
So your dad didn't actually
hit you or your mum.

38:37.034 --> 38:39.936
Well, in that case,
you're right.

38:40.004 --> 38:44.074
I have absolutely no idea
what that's like.

38:49.747 --> 38:51.481
Kimberly...

38:51.549 --> 38:53.450
Is at a friend's house.

38:55.486 --> 38:57.787
Her parents
are out of town.

39:02.426 --> 39:04.227
Oh.

39:06.130 --> 39:10.467
Hi.

39:11.335 --> 39:14.471
Hi. Hi. My sweet.

39:14.538 --> 39:16.005
I missed you so much.

39:16.073 --> 39:18.191
Oh, my baby, my sweet.

39:18.275 --> 39:19.809
I know. I know.

39:19.877 --> 39:23.279
Hi.

39:24.832 --> 39:28.084
Thank you for bringing her
back safe.

39:29.253 --> 39:31.020
Her rash is better.

39:31.088 --> 39:32.705
I had the cream.

39:32.790 --> 39:35.041
Oh, LJ,

39:35.126 --> 39:36.993
what happened?

39:40.998 --> 39:43.733
Kimmy's home, Lane.

39:43.801 --> 39:45.268
Thank God.

39:47.538 --> 39:48.705
Baby.

39:58.682 --> 39:59.883
Let's go inside.

39:59.950 --> 40:02.702
Yeah. Let's get
her inside.

40:05.122 --> 40:06.890
Thank you.

40:14.932 --> 40:18.735
We got a lot
of talkin' to do, dad.

40:20.437 --> 40:21.871
Yeah.

40:26.644 --> 40:28.811
We gotta take LJ in, Lane.

40:30.114 --> 40:31.080
What?

40:31.148 --> 40:32.482
You kiddin' me?

40:32.550 --> 40:35.385
He kidnapped
your daughter.

40:35.452 --> 40:39.088
No. No, w-we're not
pressing charges.

40:39.156 --> 40:41.424
That's not up to you,
and you know it.

40:41.492 --> 40:45.094
If it's any consolation, your wife
gets a pass on the false statement.

40:50.301 --> 40:52.535
Let's go, LJ.

41:01.712 --> 41:04.347
You gonna be all right?

41:04.415 --> 41:07.450
Heh.

41:07.518 --> 41:10.687
Ask me when I get
my whole family back.

41:12.723 --> 41:14.357
Oi.

41:17.595 --> 41:19.229
Go easy.

41:42.653 --> 41:43.920
The framers
never imagined

41:43.988 --> 41:46.022
that their intentions
would be scrutinized this way.

41:46.090 --> 41:47.390
Have you even
read the document?

41:47.458 --> 41:48.758
Of course I've
read the document.

41:48.809 --> 41:50.793
Don't do that.
Em, don't do that.

41:50.861 --> 41:53.596
Don't roll your eyes like that.
Don't make it personal.

41:53.664 --> 41:54.764
I didn't roll my eyes.

41:54.832 --> 41:55.732
Pfft. Pull the other one.

41:55.799 --> 41:57.166
I didn't. Liam?

41:57.234 --> 41:58.768
I-I'd stay out of this
if I were you, mate.

41:58.836 --> 42:00.703
Great. I--I didn't
roll my eyes.

42:00.771 --> 42:01.604
Well, you were about to.

42:01.672 --> 42:02.772
But I didn't,
and you're

42:02.840 --> 42:04.173
the only person who
would know that,

42:04.241 --> 42:05.208
and I'm not
debating you.

42:05.276 --> 42:06.676
And he hasn't
even read it.

42:06.744 --> 42:08.044
I have.
He has.

42:08.112 --> 42:09.479
Whatever.

42:09.546 --> 42:11.214
Apology accepted.

42:11.282 --> 42:13.850
Never directly
engage the enemy.

42:13.917 --> 42:16.953
Em, just pretend
they're not there--

42:17.021 --> 42:18.721
no eye contact,
nothing.

42:18.789 --> 42:19.722
Enemy?

42:19.790 --> 42:20.790
Isn't that
personal,

42:20.858 --> 42:23.126
exactly how you
said not to be?

42:23.193 --> 42:25.461
I was just beginning
to like you, son.

42:25.529 --> 42:27.597
Even though
we make out?

42:27.665 --> 42:30.433
All right, now. I'm out of it.
Good luck with her, mate.

42:30.501 --> 42:32.068
Meaning the debate
is over?

42:32.136 --> 42:33.836
Meaning round one to Emily.

42:33.904 --> 42:35.138
11 to go.
