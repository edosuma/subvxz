Look at this.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.690
His name is El Limpiador,

23:46.692 --> 23:49.026

a blind eye to the people

Let me be clear--
I'm no politician.

27:17.103 --> 27:20.004
Like most of you,
I come from nothing.

27:20.006 --> 27:22.072

Epifanio's cartel has

31:52.344 --> 31:54.845
That would be a mistake...

31:54.847 --> 31:58.081
because I have
so much more to offer.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.200
I did what I did to Eric.

32:17.202 --> 32:20.270
But truth be told,
you know how I felt about him.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.205
I would be lying

32:22.207 --> 32:25.309
anything other than
I despise him.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.711
I must say,

32:27.713 --> 32:31.214
your husband's a better diplomat
than you are.

32:31.216 --> 32:33.617
Diplomacy breeds lies.

32:33.619 --> 32:36.386
It breeds deception.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.722
You cannot tell people
what you really think

32:38.724 --> 32:40.223
if you're being diplomatic.

32:40.225 --> 32:42.059
And you're right,

32:42.061 --> 32:44.261
my husband is much better
at it than I am.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.096
So you're gonna tell it
like it is?

32:46.098 --> 32:47.931
That's just the way
I'm built.

32:47.933 --> 32:50.801
Then you better start
telling it now.

32:50.803 --> 32:54.404
I used you.

32:54.406 --> 32:57.407
You reacted
on my attack on Eric

32:57.409 --> 32:59.409
exactly the way
I needed you to.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.845
You attacked Epifanio

33:01.847 --> 33:04.948
because you thought
he was responsible.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.516
And by doing so,

33:06.518 --> 33:09.186
you destabilized him
for a moment.

33:09.188 --> 33:11.855
I needed him to take his eye
off the ball.

33:11.857 --> 33:15.192
You see,
every news program

33:15.194 --> 33:17.995
is covering
what you did to him.

33:17.997 --> 33:20.964
People--they're
starting to wonder

33:20.966 --> 33:24.701
about the possibility
that maybe Epifanio Vargas

33:24.703 --> 33:27.170

33:27.172 --> 33:30.507
but Vargas is for Vargas.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.676
What do you mean?

33:35.781 --> 33:39.016
The only thing
my husband cannot afford

33:39.018 --> 33:41.284
is to fight a war...

33:41.286 --> 33:44.021
because if he does,
he's gonna be outed publicly

33:44.023 --> 33:46.656
as the cartel leader
that he is.

33:46.658 --> 33:49.826
And his lies
are gonna be exposed.

33:49.828 --> 33:51.828
So, while he's distracted,

33:51.830 --> 33:53.530
backpedaling,

33:53.532 --> 33:57.167

in any of this,

33:57.169 --> 33:59.703

that I'm in Mexico right now.

You see how that works?

34:05.677 --> 34:07.044
You're taking over?

34:07.046 --> 34:08.912
Yes.

34:08.914 --> 34:12.749
