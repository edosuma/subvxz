THAT WE'RE NEAR

WHERE HE GREW UP,
BUT HE NEVER PUTS IT TOGETHER.

17:17.687 --> 17:19.220
LIKE, "OH, I KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE TAKING ME."

17:19.255 --> 17:22.807
NO, HE NEVER SAID THAT.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.560
SHOULD I WEAR MY JACKET?
YEAH.

17:25.595 --> 17:29.514

OKAY, NOW COME.
KEEP WALKING FORWARD--
A DEEP STEP.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.904
STEP UP. YEP.
THERE YOU GO. AND YOU'RE GOOD.

COMING BACK TO A HOME

18:42.055 --> 18:43.688
THAT YOU HAD NOT
PLANNED TO SEE?

18:43.723 --> 18:45.623
I THOUGHT
I WAS IN A DREAM.

18:45.658 --> 18:49.060
IT WAS ONE OF THE GRANDEST
ALL-TIME SURPRISES OF MY LIFE.

18:53.983 --> 18:55.449
IT WASN'T THE EASIEST THING
IN THE WORLD

18:55.485 --> 18:57.017
TO PUT THIS TRIP TOGETHER.

18:57.036 --> 18:58.786
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T KNOW
IF MY DAD'S OLD HOUSE

18:58.822 --> 18:59.704
WOULD EVEN BE THERE

18:59.739 --> 19:01.522
OR IF THE OWNERS
WOULD BE RECEPTIVE

19:01.558 --> 19:03.558
TO ALLOWING US
TO COME INTO THEIR HOME,

19:03.593 --> 19:06.277
BUT IT'S THE PERFECT TIME TO DO
SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR MY DAD.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.379
HE'S GOT THIS LITTLE PROBLEM
WITH HIS HEART, AND, YOU KNOW,

19:08.414 --> 19:10.515
I REALIZE THAT LIFE
IS REALLY PRECIOUS.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.316
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
THAT WE'RE DOING THIS.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.218
OH, HI. WELCOME.
COME IN.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.386
HI. I'M JOY.

19:15.421 --> 19:18.022
Jack: I THINK GOING BACK
TO YOUR CHILDHOOD HOME,

19:18.057 --> 19:20.892
THAT'S A TREMENDOUS GIFT
TO GIVE TO SOMEBODY.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.693

HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED HERE?
SINCE YOU -- FOREVER?

Jeanette: YOU KNOW, THIS HOUSE,
IT MEANS A LOT TO HIM,

19:30.670 --> 19:32.837
AND HE'S GOT
SO MANY FOND MEMORIES THERE.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.306
I LIVED HERE WHEN I WAS
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.325
IS THERE
A CONCORD GRAPE --

19:37.360 --> 19:38.826
TRELLIS OR SOMETHING
IN THE BACK?

19:38.862 --> 19:40.111
IS THERE A TRELLIS
IN THE BACK?

19:40.163 --> 19:42.563
NOT IN OUR BACKYARD.
OUR NEIGHBORS USED TO HAVE ONE.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.283
THE TRELLIS HELPED ME
GET TO MY BEDROOM WINDOW

19:45.335 --> 19:48.169
WHEN I CAME HOME
TOO LATE.

19:48.204 --> 19:50.888
THIS IS MY CAMELOT,

19:53.760 --> 19:55.793
THIS IS WHERE THINGS
WERE GREAT.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.195
I WAS HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

19:57.230 --> 19:58.930
I HAD NO FEARS,
NO WORRIES.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.665
I HAD A VERY HAPPY CHILDHOOD.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.966
WHAT GRADE
ARE YOU IN, DEREK?

20:02.001 --> 20:02.934
THIRD.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.235
I WAS ABOUT
IN THE THIRD GRADE

20:04.270 --> 20:05.469
WHEN I MOVED
INTO THIS HOUSE.

20:05.505 --> 20:06.437
OHH!

20:06.472 --> 20:08.673
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT
CONCEPT TO ME

20:08.708 --> 20:10.141
OF HAVING
YOUR GRANDCHILDREN

20:10.176 --> 20:14.028
SEEING YOU NOT ONLY
AS AN OLDER GRANDFATHER,

20:14.063 --> 20:17.481
TO SEE WHERE I WAS
WHEN I WAS THEIR AGE.

20:17.517 --> 20:22.553
IT WAS A SHARP REMINDER TO THEM
THAT I WAS NOT JUST AN OLD MAN.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.488
OH, LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE DONE
WITH THIS.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.257
Jacky:
OH, THIS IS FABULOUS.

20:26.292 --> 20:28.292
Jazz: SEEING WHERE
MY GRANDFATHER GREW UP

20:28.328 --> 20:29.894
IS REALLY, REALLY COOL

20:29.929 --> 20:31.963
BECAUSE IT'S JUST
A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT

20:31.998 --> 20:34.799
THAN WHERE I GREW UP --
SO QUAINT AND CUTE.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.450
HE'S SO ADORABLE,

20:36.469 --> 20:40.171
AND JUST SEEING HIM
BE REALLY HAPPY IS AMAZING.

20:40.223 --> 20:44.926
IN NO WAY DID I EVER THINK
I WOULD BE BACK INTO THIS HOUSE

20:44.961 --> 20:46.978
AND BACK
INTO THESE MEMORIES.

"WHAT'S GOING ON?"

"YOU'RE IN FLUTTER."

I'M BEATING TOO FAST.

Jess: THIS IS A TOUGH SURGERY
BECAUSE JAZZ'S ANATOMY

36:46.254 --> 36:48.805
IS DIFFERENT THAN MOST PATIENTS
WHO HAVE THIS SURGERY

36:48.857 --> 36:51.024
BECAUSE JAZZ HAS BEEN
PUBERTY-BLOCKED.

36:51.059 --> 36:53.693
SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE TISSUE
THAT WE NEED

36:53.729 --> 36:55.278
IN ORDER TO MAKE THE VAGINA.

36:55.314 --> 36:58.231
SO, THIS BIG QUESTION IS HOW ARE
WE GOING TO TAKE THE SKIN

36:58.266 --> 37:01.618
THAT SHE HAS AND MAXIMIZE
THAT SKIN EFFICIENTLY

37:01.653 --> 37:05.488
SO THAT EVERY CENTIMETER
OF THAT SKIN, WHICH IS PRECIOUS,

37:05.540 --> 37:08.658
CAN BE USED TO CREATE
HER NEW FEMALE GENITALIA?

37:21.473 --> 37:24.424
SO, WE'RE USING TISSUE
CALLED PERITONEUM LINING

TO REPLACE THE TISSUE
THAT JAZZ DOESN'T HAVE,

37:27.262 --> 37:30.630

FOR IMPROVISATION.

IF WE JUST ONLY MADE A LITTLE
INCISION RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.

37:42.027 --> 37:44.928

IF WE GOT WITH THE PLAN

37:44.963 --> 37:47.764

IMAGED IN MY HEAD
