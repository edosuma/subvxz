00:01.100 --> 00:02.732
Hey, I'm Chuck. 
<i>Here's a couple of things</i>

00:02.733 --> 00:04.499
<i>that you might need to know or maybe
you just forgot:</i>

00:04.500 --> 00:06.100
This isn't a code, Devon,
this is a real car.

00:06.101 --> 00:07.700
<i>My dad must have 
left this for me.</i>

00:07.701 --> 00:10.101
<i>Your father never 
wanted you to see this.</i>

00:10.169 --> 00:12.069
See what?

00:13.967 --> 00:15.800
Come on, flash!

00:15.801 --> 00:17.902
Sarah, my mom did something to me

00:17.969 --> 00:20.735
<i>with that device.</i>

00:20.803 --> 00:23.939
<i>I can't flash. The Intersect is gone!</i>

00:24.006 --> 00:25.174
Agent Carmichael's coming with me.

00:25.175 --> 00:27.738
Surrender or die.

00:27.806 --> 00:28.972
What do you want?

00:28.973 --> 00:30.873
I want the Intersect.

00:30.906 --> 00:31.906
It's gone.

00:31.907 --> 00:33.139
I lost it.

00:33.140 --> 00:35.473
The less you resist,

00:35.541 --> 00:37.808
the less painful this will be.

00:55.016 --> 00:58.783
You know what I really want?

01:00.319 --> 01:02.186
This could be a very good

01:02.187 --> 01:04.620
"show me, don't tell me" situation, I think.

01:06.489 --> 01:09.157
I want you to flash.

01:10.191 --> 01:11.858
What?

01:11.859 --> 01:13.625
I want you to flash for me.

01:13.626 --> 01:14.859
Come on, do it.

01:14.860 --> 01:15.860
Show me.

01:15.861 --> 01:17.527
But I-I can't.

01:17.528 --> 01:18.728
You know that I can't.

01:18.729 --> 01:20.062
The Intersect's not working.

01:20.063 --> 01:21.763
Why are we even talking
about this right now?

01:21.764 --> 01:24.465
Are you sure that you can't flash?

01:24.532 --> 01:26.166
Well, yeah.

01:26.167 --> 01:27.533
Yeah, pretty-pretty sure.

01:27.534 --> 01:29.268
But we-we could do other stuff, you know.

01:29.269 --> 01:31.169
We could, uh,

01:31.203 --> 01:32.970
we could kiss more.

01:32.971 --> 01:35.471
Or... talk.

01:35.539 --> 01:37.439
No. Never mind.

01:38.040 --> 01:39.107
Why? No, no.

01:39.108 --> 01:42.008
Hey... Hey, you, hey.

01:42.076 --> 01:43.976
Hey.

01:45.044 --> 01:47.211
You know, there's pills for this.

01:48.279 --> 01:49.279
Easy.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.446
Easy, buddy.

01:50.447 --> 01:51.513
This is all in your head.

01:51.514 --> 01:54.148
You have got to get over this.

01:54.216 --> 01:55.615
I mean, come on...

01:55.616 --> 01:57.850
you really expect to keep a girl like that

01:57.918 --> 01:59.851
without flashing?

02:02.921 --> 02:04.588
This doesn't make any sense.

02:04.589 --> 02:07.489
Why are you here?

02:07.557 --> 02:08.789
I shouldn't even be here.

02:08.791 --> 02:10.591
I- I was on a mission.

02:10.592 --> 02:11.591
In Switzerland.

02:11.592 --> 02:12.792
I was on a gondola.

02:12.793 --> 02:14.393
I was taken by a Belgian.

02:14.394 --> 02:16.294
What is going on?!

02:18.231 --> 02:20.499
Why isn't this working?

02:20.566 --> 02:23.501
He knows he's in a dream.

02:23.569 --> 02:25.236
Lester was the wrong choice.

02:25.237 --> 02:26.903
Intensify the current.

02:26.904 --> 02:28.605
Try something else.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.407
I just need to figure out

02:30.408 --> 02:33.742
the right combination of
people from his life to use.

02:33.809 --> 02:35.709
He calls this Ellie a lot.

02:35.776 --> 02:38.076
I can't believe something's
blocking the Intersect.

02:38.143 --> 02:39.476
You've got to dig it out.

02:39.477 --> 02:43.312
I can sell the secrets in
his head for more money than

02:43.380 --> 02:44.513
you can ever imagine.

02:44.514 --> 02:46.147
Telling me again isn't going to make this

02:46.148 --> 02:47.148
go any faster.

02:47.149 --> 02:48.982
Agent Carmichael's brain

02:48.983 --> 02:51.818
will access the Intersect
if it's properly motivated.

02:51.885 --> 02:54.519
It was clear from his
interrogation that anxiety

02:54.587 --> 02:56.821
is his strongest motivating emotion.

02:56.888 --> 02:59.156
God knows he is a neurotic man.

02:59.223 --> 03:02.424
When we find the right mix
of people from his life

03:02.492 --> 03:04.659
to pressure him, he will become so anxious

03:04.727 --> 03:06.528
about not having the Intersect

03:06.529 --> 03:09.430
that his brain will be forced to flash.

03:09.497 --> 03:11.598
But this woman,

03:11.666 --> 03:13.834
she will do most of the work.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.837
Nothing makes him more anxious

03:16.904 --> 03:19.605
than this Sarah Walker.

03:25.547 --> 03:27.915
Five countries in three days and nothing.

03:27.982 --> 03:31.252
Where's Chuck, Casey?

03:31.320 --> 03:33.422
Got every agent in Castle
out looking for him.

03:33.489 --> 03:35.157
We'll find him.

03:35.158 --> 03:37.525
Let's regroup with Beckman;
she'll have something.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.427
We have nothing. The Berlin team had

03:39.428 --> 03:40.862
an address for one of the
Belgian's lieutenants,

03:40.863 --> 03:42.497
but by the time we got a search warrant,

03:42.498 --> 03:44.165
he was onto us and had disappeared.

03:44.166 --> 03:46.200
The same thing happened
yesterday in Caracas.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.401
And our target dropped
behind North Korean lines

03:48.469 --> 03:49.969
where we couldn't follow.

03:49.970 --> 03:52.004
General, all that I'm hearing
is that a lot of bureaucracy

03:52.071 --> 03:53.371
is keeping us from finding Chuck.

03:53.372 --> 03:56.373
I know, but we have to
work with our allies here.

03:56.441 --> 03:58.609
Why don't you get a
couple of hours of sleep.

03:58.677 --> 04:00.111
I'm not going to sep, General.

04:00.112 --> 04:02.012
Chuck is out there without the Intersect

04:02.013 --> 04:03.747
with people who think that he has it.

04:03.748 --> 04:05.181
He's never been more helpless.

04:05.182 --> 04:06.548
I know.

04:06.549 --> 04:09.084
And be assured that the
Intersect is a huge priority

04:09.152 --> 04:11.086
to the U.S., as is finding the Belgian

04:11.154 --> 04:12.354
before he sells our secrets.

04:12.355 --> 04:13.489
Forget the secrets!

04:13.490 --> 04:15.390
This is about Chuck!

04:17.293 --> 04:20.361
General, I'll make sure we get some rest.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.328
We'll check back with you later.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.267
Don't. I know.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.068
You know, being a worried girlfrie

04:30.069 --> 04:31.367
isn't gonna help him at all.

04:31.368 --> 04:32.801
You need to be a spy, professional.

04:32.802 --> 04:33.801
Fine.

04:33.802 --> 04:35.935
Where do we look next?

04:36.003 --> 04:37.003
Is she off?

04:37.004 --> 04:38.738
Yeah.

04:38.739 --> 04:39.773
Welcome back.

04:39.774 --> 04:40.907
And Daddy got something.

04:40.908 --> 04:42.042
Daddy likes.

04:42.043 --> 04:43.309
Daddy...

04:43.310 --> 04:44.611
I'm Daddy.

04:44.612 --> 04:46.012
You guys were kind of-

04:46.013 --> 04:47.981
Okay, well, you were
just looking at me like-

04:48.049 --> 04:49.815
This is from our Swiss field op,

04:49.816 --> 04:52.151
which, by the way, I just love saying.

04:52.218 --> 04:54.118
His name is Anand Chanarong, okay?

04:54.120 --> 04:55.953
And he's an aide to the Thai ambassador,

04:55.954 --> 04:58.188
but he's also a known associate of

04:58.255 --> 04:59.922
one...

04:59.923 --> 05:01.390
Guys, come on. Baddie at Belgian.

05:01.391 --> 05:03.158
He handles all the Belgian's dirty work-

05:03.159 --> 05:05.459
extortion, kidnapping.

05:05.527 --> 05:07.427
And he's in L.A., at the Thai embassy.

05:08.330 --> 05:09.830
Which is Thai soil.

05:09.831 --> 05:11.198
It's not in our jurisdiction.

05:11.199 --> 05:12.599
We don't have jurisdiction, Walker.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.001
Come on, Casey, be a spy.

05:30.014 --> 05:31.881
Who told you to bring this in here?

05:31.882 --> 05:34.016
This is the ugliest rug I've ever seen.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.451
We're looking for the Belgian.

05:36.519 --> 05:37.519
Who are you?

05:37.520 --> 05:39.020
He's taken somebody.

05:39.021 --> 05:40.989
Charles Carmichael. Goes by Chuck.

05:41.056 --> 05:42.990
What do you know about him?

05:44.559 --> 05:46.827
You have no right to be here on Thai soil.

06:03.108 --> 06:05.276
Fine. Welcome to American soil.

06:08.446 --> 06:10.313
Now, where's Chuck?

06:10.314 --> 06:14.316
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

06:54.963 --> 06:56.163
I'm asking you again..

06:56.164 --> 06:58.064
Where can I find the Belgian?

07:05.572 --> 07:07.907
You know, you don't understand
how high the stakes are here.

07:07.974 --> 07:11.209
You're gonna tell me exactly
what I want to know!

07:13.245 --> 07:15.145
<i>Listen, Casey, I think Sarah's about to go</i>

07:15.147 --> 07:16.314
all <i>Kill Bill</i> on this dude.

07:16.315 --> 07:17.682
And rumor has it that Beckman knows

07:17.683 --> 07:19.283
somebody stormed in the
embassy and stole a national.

07:19.284 --> 07:21.185
Now, I know I'm the new guy here,
but I think

07:21.253 --> 07:22.720
that's kind of international
incident-y, isn't it?

07:22.721 --> 07:24.488
Walker knows what lines not to cross.

07:24.489 --> 07:26.389
Walker!

07:27.158 --> 07:29.259
A word, please.

07:29.327 --> 07:31.061
Well, can it wait?

07:31.062 --> 07:32.962
No.

07:37.533 --> 07:39.401
He's not talking.

07:39.402 --> 07:40.903
And he's a smirker. You know, just 'cause

07:40.904 --> 07:42.103
I helped you bring him here

07:42.104 --> 07:43.770
doesn't mean I'm giving you free reign.

07:43.771 --> 07:45.037
You need to cool down, get some rest.

07:45.038 --> 07:46.771
I'm not going anywhere.

07:46.772 --> 07:48.039
I was wrong about you.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.040
You're not acting like a worried girlfriend.

07:50.108 --> 07:53.643
No, you're acting like a spy
I used to know, before Chuck.

07:53.711 --> 07:56.045
Langston Graham's wild card enforcer.

07:56.113 --> 07:57.113
I didn't like

07:57.114 --> 07:58.614
that Sarah Walker. You know why?

07:58.615 --> 08:00.082
'Cause she was unpredictable.

08:00.083 --> 08:01.917
Now, you're gonna go home.

08:01.918 --> 08:03.052
I insist.

08:03.053 --> 08:04.754
You insist? How are you gonna do that?

08:04.755 --> 08:07.057
I- I insist. I... I insist.

08:07.124 --> 08:08.324
Hey, hey, listen to me.

08:08.325 --> 08:11.161
Look, Sarah, we all want to find Chuck, okay?

08:11.228 --> 08:12.829
But I think we could all use

08:12.830 --> 08:14.130
a little rest, too, right?

08:14.131 --> 08:16.399
I know I'm super cranky
if I get under nine hours,

08:16.467 --> 08:18.835
so let's-let's calm down and-a
let's go get a few winks.

08:19.970 --> 08:21.236
Then you go back to your manhunt.

08:21.237 --> 08:23.137
Nice and well-rested.

08:23.205 --> 08:25.840
Okay?

08:25.908 --> 08:27.909
You have two hours.

08:31.880 --> 08:32.947
Whoa.

08:32.948 --> 08:34.282
Man, that was scary.

08:34.283 --> 08:35.549
I do okay?

08:35.549 --> 08:37.251
I was kind of shaking there.

08:37.251 --> 08:39.152
I- I know it's not scary for you, but...

08:40.221 --> 08:41.455
Hm...

08:41.456 --> 08:43.823
I can't believe you have a 36-hour shift.

08:43.892 --> 08:45.359
You're pregnant; it's not okay.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.627
Honey, the nurses reserved
me my own broom closet.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.029
I have a very nice cot.

08:49.030 --> 08:50.163
I will steal some winks.

08:50.164 --> 08:51.631
Between these long shifts at the hospital

08:51.632 --> 08:53.132
and all the stressing about your family,

08:53.133 --> 08:55.367
I'm worried about you, and the baby.

08:55.434 --> 08:58.202
Listen, I promise to take care of myself.

08:58.270 --> 08:59.837
You need to be calm and peaceful.

08:59.838 --> 09:01.638
I will be calm and peaceful.

09:01.639 --> 09:02.873
Not too calm.

09:02.874 --> 09:04.509
And don't go falling asleep at the wheel.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.744
Speaking of, can't you take the new Sienna?

09:06.812 --> 09:07.812
I like my dad's ride.

09:07.813 --> 09:08.813
Did your dad's ride

09:08.814 --> 09:09.914
get five out of five stars

09:09.915 --> 09:11.815
in side-impact protection?

09:12.986 --> 09:14.987
What is this?

09:19.459 --> 09:20.959
Whoa.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.427
What is this thing?

09:23.495 --> 09:25.395
I've never seen anything like it.

09:25.396 --> 09:26.563
I don't know.

09:26.564 --> 09:28.298
I thought that I found
everything of my dad's

09:28.299 --> 09:29.799
that there was to find.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.167
Do you think it's spy stuff?

09:31.168 --> 09:33.168
I don't know.

09:33.236 --> 09:37.205
Uh, we could try and turn
it on and figure out.

09:37.273 --> 09:39.607
Right.

09:39.675 --> 09:42.310
I don't want it to be spy stuff.

09:44.179 --> 09:46.080
You do it.

09:48.116 --> 09:50.016
Okay.

09:59.225 --> 10:00.591
Nothing.

10:00.592 --> 10:02.226
Shoot.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.427
I'm late.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.328
I can't believe that I
have to work for two days.

10:05.363 --> 10:06.596
This is all I'm gonna think about

10:06.597 --> 10:07.797
the whole time. It's gonna kill me.

10:07.798 --> 10:09.898
Babe, remember, we're staying calm.

10:09.966 --> 10:11.933
Okay? You go to work and you don't worry.

10:12.001 --> 10:13.868
Maybe I'll just call Chuck
and we'll figure it out.

10:13.869 --> 10:15.003
No. No Chuck, okay?

10:15.004 --> 10:16.037
If this is spy-related,

10:16.038 --> 10:17.672
it's gonna reehim back in.

10:17.673 --> 10:19.573
I want to keep him safe.

10:22.876 --> 10:24.978
<i>Chuck, listen to me very closely.</i>

10:25.045 --> 10:27.846
If you don't access the Intersect,

10:27.914 --> 10:30.582
forget about Sarah,

10:30.650 --> 10:33.084
Ellie, Morgan

10:33.151 --> 10:36.653
and this Awesome character.

10:36.721 --> 10:39.490
No one will love you.

10:39.558 --> 10:42.393
You'll be nothing.

10:42.461 --> 10:44.462
You will lose them all.

11:24.634 --> 11:26.634
Sniff. 

11:53.593 --> 11:55.493
How you holding up?

11:56.663 --> 11:57.996
Not great.

11:57.997 --> 11:59.697
Yeah... no. Me, either.

11:59.698 --> 12:01.666
I've had this awful taste in mouth

12:01.733 --> 12:03.234
ever since Chuck disappeared.

12:03.235 --> 12:05.269
Which makes me think, wherever he is,

12:05.337 --> 12:07.237
he's probably eating something icky.

12:08.439 --> 12:10.540
Strange twin thing.

12:13.243 --> 12:15.277
Do you know what this is?

12:16.313 --> 12:18.080
No.

12:18.081 --> 12:20.849
No. No, I've never seen it before.

12:20.917 --> 12:23.853
I really miss him.

12:23.921 --> 12:25.254
Fine, okay? I-I fold.

12:25.255 --> 12:27.155
It's Chuck's proposal plan.

12:27.623 --> 12:29.523
I hate myself.

12:30.459 --> 12:32.359
Chuck was planning on proposing?

12:33.795 --> 12:35.729
Yeah.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.031
See, it's a combination of...

12:37.032 --> 12:38.932
of things that are important to both of you,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.966
and... and some of it is
just from when he was little.

12:42.034 --> 12:45.937
So, here is where he was going
to drive up in his DeLorean.

12:46.004 --> 12:47.371
Of course.

12:47.372 --> 12:50.007
That would be you,
coming down on a wild stallion.

12:50.074 --> 12:51.474
You meet here.

12:51.475 --> 12:53.509
And then, from there,
you guys were going to hop

12:53.577 --> 12:55.411
in this Lamborghini and
take off down the coast.

12:55.412 --> 12:57.046
This actually, though,
might be an older draft.

12:57.047 --> 12:58.981
You know, it's been revamped since puberty.

12:59.049 --> 13:00.949
When was he planning on doing this?

13:02.051 --> 13:03.385
I don't know. You know, I mean,

13:03.386 --> 13:04.686
ever since he lost the Intersect,

13:04.687 --> 13:06.854
the proposal plan got put on hold.

13:06.921 --> 13:08.021
Why?

13:08.022 --> 13:09.455
Did he think that I wouldn't want

13:09.456 --> 13:10.690
to marry him without the Intersect?

13:10.691 --> 13:12.124
Is that how I made him feel?

13:12.125 --> 13:15.460
No. No, Chuck knew that...

13:15.528 --> 13:18.429
Chuck <i>knows</i> that you love him, Sarah.

13:18.496 --> 13:20.731
Okay, it's just, you're kind of a big fish,

13:20.798 --> 13:23.067
you know, and to a regular guy

13:23.135 --> 13:25.369
with no supercomputer in his brain,

13:25.437 --> 13:28.672
I got to think that that's
pretty intimidating.

13:28.739 --> 13:31.207
But that's not the reason why I love Chuck.

13:31.275 --> 13:33.743
I do want to spend the
rest of my life with Chuck-

13:33.811 --> 13:35.711
with or without the Intersect.

13:35.746 --> 13:37.514
That's fantastic. That's great.

13:37.515 --> 13:38.949
Yeah, and he knows that, right?

13:38.950 --> 13:40.850
Because you told him that.

13:45.022 --> 13:47.023
Oh.

13:51.394 --> 13:53.929
So you're certain you know
nothing about the whereabouts

13:53.997 --> 13:55.898
of the Thai aide, Anand Chanarong.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.432
Haven't heard a word, ma'am.

13:57.433 --> 13:58.600
How mysterious.

13:58.601 --> 14:01.803
I want you to keep an eye on Agent Walker.

14:01.871 --> 14:03.805
I think she might be...

14:03.873 --> 14:05.773
on the edge.

14:07.743 --> 14:09.611
What are you doing back here, Walker?

14:09.612 --> 14:12.080
Is the surveillance camera in
Chanarong's cell is still out?

14:12.148 --> 14:13.815
What's in the bag? You should go.

14:13.816 --> 14:16.017
You're not going to want to be here
for this. I'm not going anywhere.

14:19.321 --> 14:21.221
I insist.

14:38.241 --> 14:40.541
Do you feel like talking yet?

14:40.609 --> 14:43.544
An American agent in a government facility

14:43.578 --> 14:46.213
would never use any of that.

14:46.281 --> 14:48.515
I'm not afraid.

14:48.582 --> 14:50.482
You're right.

14:51.318 --> 14:53.386
Normally, I wouldn't threaten a subject

14:53.453 --> 14:55.421
with death by ammonia injection-

14:55.489 --> 14:58.190
burning somebody from the inside out.

14:58.257 --> 14:59.657
Doesn't sound like something

14:59.658 --> 15:01.558
that's in the Geneva Convention, does it?

15:03.695 --> 15:07.230
But this man that I'm looking for-
he loves me.

15:08.498 --> 15:11.733
He wants to marry me.

15:11.801 --> 15:13.567
I see.

15:13.568 --> 15:16.770
It's amazing what a woman
will do to find a husband.

15:16.838 --> 15:19.940
Even the toughest spies in the world

15:20.008 --> 15:23.578
are just racing against
that biological clock.

15:23.646 --> 15:27.583
Tick, tick, tick, tock.

15:29.319 --> 15:31.387
You got me.

15:31.454 --> 15:33.722
I'm just a needy,

15:33.790 --> 15:36.926
love-crazed girl on a husband hunt...

15:38.261 --> 15:41.964
...who's trained in over
200 ways to kill you.

15:42.032 --> 15:44.433
Afraid yet?

15:44.501 --> 15:46.402
The Belgian has a hideout in the jungles

15:46.469 --> 15:48.337
of northern Thailand,
near the Burmese border.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.238
That jungle is filled
with nothing but killers.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.140
I'm going with you.

15:52.742 --> 15:54.309
You're not going where I'm going.

15:54.310 --> 15:56.044
I'll do anything to get him back,

15:56.045 --> 15:58.680
and I'm not going to take you down with me.

15:58.748 --> 16:00.449
You were right.

16:00.450 --> 16:02.451
I'm different without Chuck,
and I don't like it.

16:02.518 --> 16:04.419
You let me out of here. You need me.

16:04.487 --> 16:06.688
No. I need Chuck.

16:09.092 --> 16:10.992
Walker!

16:29.959 --> 16:31.627
Who's got a screw loose?

16:31.628 --> 16:33.662
That has two meanings.

16:33.730 --> 16:35.164
Hey, guys, thanks for coming.

16:35.165 --> 16:36.732
I'm kind of hopeless in tech land,

16:36.733 --> 16:38.699
and I was hoping to get this computer fixed

16:38.767 --> 16:40.701
before Ellie got home
from her monster shift.

16:40.769 --> 16:42.669
Well, lucky for you,
my Tuesday trapeze class

16:42.704 --> 16:44.604
was canceled, so we're all yours.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.305
You have a Roark 7?

16:47.306 --> 16:49.341
Yeah, guess so.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.676
Oh, one other thing-

16:50.677 --> 16:52.243
this little project has to stay

16:52.244 --> 16:53.277
a secret from Chuck.

16:53.278 --> 16:54.311
Can we do that?

16:54.312 --> 16:56.079
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, we can,

16:56.080 --> 16:59.248
my large, chiseled,
<i>dulce de leche</i> colored friend.

16:59.316 --> 17:02.384
But we want a little... something from you,

17:02.452 --> 17:04.252
if you know what I mean.

17:04.252 --> 17:07.255
No, I actually have no idea what you mean.

17:07.321 --> 17:09.690
Four words:

17:09.758 --> 17:12.858
my abscess, Lester's gout.

17:12.926 --> 17:16.929
Medical consult for tech expertise.

17:16.997 --> 17:18.896
You in?

17:20.299 --> 17:23.534
Yeah, uh, anything for Ellie.

17:23.602 --> 17:25.435
Good. Fabulous. Fabulous.

17:25.436 --> 17:27.438
All right, now, let me look at the computer

17:27.506 --> 17:29.506
while Jeffrey takes off his pants.

17:30.709 --> 17:32.843
Yeah, I... I need to get my kit.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.348
Hey. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

17:38.349 --> 17:40.750
I closed my eyes for a minute,
and then she was gone.

17:40.817 --> 17:43.119
She's so sneaky.
She must make an awesome spy.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.353
Walker went AWOL. Open the door.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.587
I kind of figured she'd do...

17:45.588 --> 17:46.688
something crazy like this.

17:46.689 --> 17:48.289
I might be responsible.

17:48.290 --> 17:50.758
I told her about Chuck's plans on proposing.

17:50.826 --> 17:52.760
What?! You threw gas on the fire.

17:52.828 --> 17:54.728
Can't you ever keep your mouth shut?

17:54.796 --> 17:56.396
I'm sorry, Casey, okay?

17:56.397 --> 17:58.799
I overshare to connect. I'm a connecter.

17:58.866 --> 18:00.801
Open the door. Yeah.

18:02.270 --> 18:04.438
Okay, I...

18:05.807 --> 18:07.942
What? I want in.

18:08.009 --> 18:09.343
Okay? No, listen to me.

18:09.344 --> 18:11.177
Chuck is my best friend,
and I want to do more

18:11.178 --> 18:13.012
than just sit behind some
computer to try to find him.

18:13.013 --> 18:15.248
Absolutely not.
Chuck's in the jungles of hell.

18:15.316 --> 18:17.250
It's way too dangerous for you.

18:17.318 --> 18:18.585
Well, fine.

18:18.586 --> 18:20.420
I mean, you want out, I want in.

18:20.421 --> 18:22.488
All right? Come on, I'm ready to go.

18:22.556 --> 18:24.456
I have a backpack.

18:25.025 --> 18:27.193
Casey, it's Chuck.

18:29.697 --> 18:30.863
Fine.

18:30.864 --> 18:32.832
Deal? Deal.

18:35.102 --> 18:36.369
No bullets for you. What?

18:36.370 --> 18:38.270
Come on. We're going to Thailand. Ow!

19:08.870 --> 19:11.404
You can talk to me.

19:15.408 --> 19:17.476
I heard the Belgian has a hideout here.

19:17.543 --> 19:19.344
Is this true?

19:19.345 --> 19:20.979
First, sit down.

19:20.980 --> 19:22.280
Relax.

19:22.281 --> 19:24.449
Join me for a drink.

19:27.086 --> 19:28.419
He has my boyfriend.

19:28.420 --> 19:30.121
Where is he?

19:30.122 --> 19:32.622
Maybe I can be your boyfriend.

19:40.464 --> 19:43.098
Anyone else want to be my boyfriend?

19:45.768 --> 19:47.768
Sarah, no.

19:47.836 --> 19:49.269
I can't lose you.

19:49.270 --> 19:50.503
Please don't go.

19:50.504 --> 19:52.404
I'll do anything!

19:54.508 --> 19:56.175
You say that, but then you don't flash.

19:56.176 --> 19:58.243
You clearly don't want me enough.

19:58.311 --> 19:59.744
I do.

19:59.745 --> 20:01.412
But I... but I can't flash.

20:01.413 --> 20:02.746
I know you wouldn't do this.

20:02.747 --> 20:04.981
I know this is just a dream,
but please come back!

20:11.519 --> 20:12.952
It's not working.

20:12.953 --> 20:14.687
He's still aware enough

20:14.688 --> 20:15.921
to suppress the Intersect.

20:15.922 --> 20:17.122
Look at this.

20:17.123 --> 20:19.257
I'm stimulating the
hippocampus as much as I can

20:19.325 --> 20:20.925
without causing permanent damage.

20:20.926 --> 20:24.294
Don't take this the wrong way,
Mueller, but you are boring me.

20:24.362 --> 20:26.429
Push harder.

20:26.497 --> 20:29.465
Then we are in phase three.

20:29.533 --> 20:33.067
We wipe out everything in
his head but the Intersect.

20:33.135 --> 20:34.602
We lobotomize him.

20:34.603 --> 20:37.272
So, there would be no personality,

20:37.339 --> 20:39.408
no memories, no thoughts

20:39.476 --> 20:41.911
in the way of the Intersect.

20:41.979 --> 20:43.479
All right.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.380
Let's do it.

20:53.255 --> 20:55.456
That was very impressive.

20:55.524 --> 20:57.191
I'm guessing you are the woman

20:57.192 --> 21:00.127
who has been fighting
her way across Thailand.

21:00.194 --> 21:01.928
The people have been talking much

21:01.929 --> 21:03.930
about the giant blonde she-male.

21:05.232 --> 21:07.066
Can you tell me where to find the Belgian?

21:07.067 --> 21:09.835
He's taken somebody very important to me.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.402
I don't like the Belgian,

21:11.403 --> 21:12.804
so I will tell you where he is.

21:12.805 --> 21:15.406
But first, a little fun.

21:17.475 --> 21:19.143
I will give you the information

21:19.144 --> 21:21.611
if you can beat my best fighter.

21:21.679 --> 21:23.312
It's been months

21:23.313 --> 21:25.314
since he's had a good match.

21:25.382 --> 21:27.116
He kills too fast.

21:27.117 --> 21:30.453
I think you might make things entertaining.

21:30.521 --> 21:32.587
So...

21:32.655 --> 21:35.190
yes?

23:10.403 --> 23:13.238
This ends now!

23:16.408 --> 23:20.609
I definitely know how to use this, dirtbags!

23:34.923 --> 23:37.124
Smart move.

23:37.192 --> 23:39.092
Good move, gentlemen.

23:39.727 --> 23:41.395
Nice beard. Nice beard.

23:41.396 --> 23:43.063
Sarah!

23:43.064 --> 23:44.932
Morgan?

23:44.933 --> 23:47.367
Yeah, yeah. Are you okay? Hold on.

23:47.435 --> 23:49.436
Using this?

23:51.005 --> 23:52.172
Here, water.

23:52.173 --> 23:54.173
Some water.

23:54.241 --> 23:57.075
How did you find me? How did we find you?

23:57.143 --> 23:59.511
Half of Thailand is talking
about the giant blonde she-male

23:59.579 --> 24:01.013
that's tearing through their town.
Are you kidding me?

24:01.014 --> 24:04.550
But it's okay now. Casey and I are here.

24:05.886 --> 24:08.787
Oh, my God! Scary snake! Scary snake!

24:08.855 --> 24:10.755
King cobra!

24:12.158 --> 24:13.625
Walker,

24:13.626 --> 24:16.027
what are you doing here all alone?

24:16.095 --> 24:17.995
This is nothing but scoundrels,

24:18.030 --> 24:19.531
assassins and warlords.

24:19.532 --> 24:21.432
The scum of the Earth.

24:21.467 --> 24:24.469
Ah, Mr. Casey, your usual?

24:27.006 --> 24:29.407
Come on. Let's get out of here.

24:31.644 --> 24:32.944
A deal's a deal.

24:32.945 --> 24:34.713
The fight's not over.

24:34.714 --> 24:39.083
I beat your guy,
you tell me where the Belgian is.

24:41.487 --> 24:43.387
I'm gonna finish this.

24:44.423 --> 24:47.958
Seriously, does no one care?
There's a cobra in there!

24:49.294 --> 24:51.062
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:51.063 --> 24:53.932
You are not getting bullets
for a long, long time.

24:53.999 --> 24:55.367
There's a lot of bullets.

24:55.368 --> 24:57.268
Tons and tons of bullets.

24:57.904 --> 24:59.438
I can't work with this. Nando!

24:59.439 --> 25:01.339
Posidrive screwdriver, stat!

25:03.444 --> 25:06.379
What is this? This is not a pos...

25:06.447 --> 25:08.748
Are you gonna earn your
lanced boil or aren't you?

25:08.816 --> 25:10.216
Agh! You know what? Just go!

25:10.217 --> 25:13.453
Jeffrey! Hey, rise,
man! We only got a few hours left

25:13.520 --> 25:14.754
till the end of Ellie's shift

25:14.755 --> 25:16.589
and I can't make heads
or tails of this thing.

25:16.590 --> 25:18.892
Can't anne upstairs help?

25:18.959 --> 25:20.259
Whoo, what a relief.

25:20.260 --> 25:22.294
So I just insert the softener and...

25:22.362 --> 25:23.462
Yep, that should do it.

25:23.463 --> 25:24.596
I really appreciate your help.

25:24.597 --> 25:26.498
I know you're a heart doctor,

25:26.566 --> 25:28.500
and don't often deal in the darker corners

25:28.568 --> 25:29.635
of the human body.

25:29.636 --> 25:30.836
No, no, sure don't.

25:30.837 --> 25:34.038
Now, you have a part that Lester needed?

25:34.106 --> 25:35.273
Sure do.

25:35.274 --> 25:36.874
Here you go.

25:36.875 --> 25:38.175
Thank you.

25:38.176 --> 25:40.610
Nice thing you're doing
for your lady, by the way.

25:40.678 --> 25:43.713
Thanks. I'm gonna go wash up.

26:48.208 --> 26:50.108
Yeah!

26:55.249 --> 26:57.349
Hello? Hey! Finally got you.

26:57.417 --> 27:00.485
I haven't seen you in a few days. Ellie...

27:00.552 --> 27:04.721
Ellie, Ellie, listen,
I don't know how to tell you this,

27:04.789 --> 27:06.689
but I'm in major trouble.

27:14.264 --> 27:15.831
What's going on?

27:15.832 --> 27:18.601
Listen, listen, okay, look I'm sorry.
Please don't be mad,

27:18.669 --> 27:20.938
but I've been spying again,
and I've been taken, okay?

27:21.005 --> 27:23.541
I need you to call Sarah,
I need you to call Casey.

27:39.356 --> 27:41.256
Hah!

27:41.792 --> 27:44.227
Oh, yes.

27:51.900 --> 27:53.800
Now where's Chuck?

27:54.702 --> 27:56.803
I am somewhere in the jungle in Thailand

27:56.871 --> 27:58.506
and I am running for my life.

27:58.507 --> 28:01.144
Can't you flash? Well, no, I can't.

28:01.212 --> 28:03.313
I think you can.

28:03.381 --> 28:05.781
Ellie, you don't sound very upset.

28:05.848 --> 28:09.248
Well, I just know you could
flash if you really tried.

28:11.518 --> 28:14.986
This is all a dream, too.

28:15.054 --> 28:17.522
I can't get out of here, can I?

28:17.589 --> 28:19.757
No, Chuck, you can't.

28:19.824 --> 28:21.392
My name is Dr. Mueller.

28:21.393 --> 28:24.328
I'm the one doing this to you.

28:24.395 --> 28:27.364
If you don't access the Intersect,

28:27.431 --> 28:30.667
I will be erasing everything that is you:

28:30.735 --> 28:37.005
your thoughts, your memories, your life.

28:41.277 --> 28:42.310
You're real.

28:42.311 --> 28:43.545
I'm very real.

28:43.546 --> 28:44.980
Now, Chuck, do you want to disappear

28:44.981 --> 28:47.882
or do you want to give me the Intersect?

28:50.451 --> 28:52.351
I can't.

29:07.114 --> 29:09.449
Look, I'm sorry about Castle, but Chuck...

29:09.516 --> 29:10.917
No, no, it's all right.

29:10.918 --> 29:14.120
The moron told me he
blabbed about the proposal.

29:14.187 --> 29:17.423
I'm not leaving until I find him.

29:17.490 --> 29:19.390
Neither am I.

29:26.097 --> 29:28.965
Wow. It's like your gun is your soul.

29:29.033 --> 29:30.900
Your metaphorical "yes" to a question

29:30.901 --> 29:33.268
she couldn't possibly bring herself to ask.

29:33.335 --> 29:35.536
Okay, emotion later. Tonight we find Chuck!

29:35.604 --> 29:38.039
Rear with the gear. You ride in the back.

29:38.107 --> 29:40.007
Tonight I ride in the back.

29:41.338 --> 29:43.905
Initiating phase three.

29:46.308 --> 29:47.977
How long will it take?

29:47.978 --> 29:50.480
To wipe his mind clean? It varies.

29:50.548 --> 29:53.582
But look at this section here.

29:53.650 --> 29:55.751
It's beginning.

29:57.320 --> 29:59.687
Good-bye, Chuck.

30:02.590 --> 30:06.127
Hey, Chuck? Chuck?

30:06.194 --> 30:09.464
Hey, hey, wake up, buddy.

30:10.566 --> 30:12.466
Hey, son. Get on up.

30:13.536 --> 30:15.436
You've been sleeping for a long time, man.

30:20.642 --> 30:25.111
I know... I know that this
is still just a dream,

30:25.179 --> 30:27.647
but you are all very real.

30:27.715 --> 30:29.517
Of course we're real.

30:29.518 --> 30:32.852
No. No, no, no, no, no, I- I-I was taken.

30:32.920 --> 30:35.021
And I almost escaped.

30:35.088 --> 30:37.856
No, that was a dream, too.

30:37.924 --> 30:39.724
Like <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>

30:39.725 --> 30:43.160
or that episode of either <i>Family
Ties</i> or <i>Hogan's Family.</i>

30:43.228 --> 30:46.297
I don't know what you're
talking about, buddy.

30:46.365 --> 30:49.234
But we sure would like
it if you were to flash.

30:57.144 --> 30:59.044
Ah!

30:59.913 --> 31:03.816
See? See? I told you this is just a dream.

31:03.884 --> 31:06.387
A dream that hurts. Ow.

31:16.732 --> 31:19.367
Here. Okay.

31:19.435 --> 31:21.135
Here's my pitch:

31:21.136 --> 31:24.539
What if you we didn't use
guns this time, okay?

31:24.607 --> 31:27.308
If you guys don't use guns,
they don't use guns.

31:27.375 --> 31:30.176
If they don't use guns,
we have this lovely little mission

31:30.244 --> 31:31.544
where nobody gets shot.

31:31.545 --> 31:32.878
You see what I'm saying?

31:32.879 --> 31:34.779
Hmm, a diversion instead.

31:35.114 --> 31:36.114
A magnet.

31:36.115 --> 31:38.151
Ready, Morgan?

31:39.420 --> 31:41.688
Guns. Let's use lots of guns!

31:46.425 --> 31:50.728
What do you think it feels like
to watch your life disappear?

31:58.370 --> 32:01.506
Chuck?

32:01.574 --> 32:02.908
Hey, Chuck.

32:02.909 --> 32:04.109
Morgan?

32:04.110 --> 32:06.412
It's me, buddy, yeah.

32:06.479 --> 32:08.848
I'm right here, okay? Now just flash.

32:08.916 --> 32:10.683
Right, this is a dream.

32:10.684 --> 32:12.217
This is only a dream.

32:12.218 --> 32:14.085
Chuck, over here.

32:14.086 --> 32:16.020
I need ya to flash, son.

32:16.088 --> 32:18.589
Okay, I'm ready to wake up now.

32:22.194 --> 32:25.963
I mean, remember when Sarah left you?

32:26.031 --> 32:27.064
Oh, my God.

32:27.065 --> 32:28.466
That was, that was funny.

32:28.467 --> 32:30.367
I mean, man.

32:30.469 --> 32:31.469
Chuck.

32:31.470 --> 32:32.637
I'm on TV.

32:32.638 --> 32:35.072
What's it gonna be, Bartowski? Huh?

32:35.140 --> 32:38.209
You want to be a nerd
or you want to be a spy?

32:38.276 --> 32:40.176
Flh or become expendable, Agent Bartowski.

32:44.349 --> 32:45.650
Flash, okay?

32:45.651 --> 32:47.618
Flash now, Chuck.

32:47.686 --> 32:50.321
This is your last chance. Do it, Bartowski.

32:50.388 --> 32:52.223
What's the matter with you?
Don't you love your country?

32:52.224 --> 32:54.124
Can I get out?

32:54.960 --> 32:56.160
Come on! Flash!

32:56.161 --> 32:57.294
Do you want to be

32:57.295 --> 32:59.195
more than just a nerd? I want to get out.

33:00.364 --> 33:02.065
No! No, I can't!

33:02.066 --> 33:03.233
I can't!

33:03.234 --> 33:05.134
You need to flash!

33:10.839 --> 33:12.039
Hey. Hey, be care-

33:12.040 --> 33:13.807
Hey, only you can prevent forest fires, man.

33:13.808 --> 33:14.808
This is dangerous.

33:14.809 --> 33:16.076
Be careful.

33:16.077 --> 33:17.544
Is this a hostel?

33:17.545 --> 33:19.512
Or is there, is there a
hostel nearby because...?

33:21.215 --> 33:22.315
It's-It's a book.

33:22.316 --> 33:24.216
Just a book.

33:35.330 --> 33:36.931
Oh, man.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.099
Help me out here, guys.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.938
Hey, you!

33:39.939 --> 33:42.240
Shut up.

33:42.308 --> 33:43.908
Get on your knees.

33:43.909 --> 33:45.677
Who brought their dad to the party?

33:52.518 --> 33:55.020
I have some friendship bracelets.

33:55.087 --> 33:58.122
All right, this-this is, like,
a violation of my civil rights.

34:13.371 --> 34:16.339
Looks like we didn't
need the guns after all.

34:16.407 --> 34:18.074
What is up with this she-male thing?

34:18.074 --> 34:20.010
<i>Chuck, it's okay.</i>

34:23.014 --> 34:26.283
Ellie... Ellie, help me.

34:26.350 --> 34:27.550
Help me.

34:27.551 --> 34:29.018
I know you're not real.

34:29.018 --> 34:30.786
But help me wake up.

34:30.788 --> 34:32.487
Chuck, I'm right here.

34:32.489 --> 34:34.456
We all really need you to flash though.

34:34.524 --> 34:36.425
No. No, I can't!

34:42.899 --> 34:44.833
No. Get away from the door!

34:46.069 --> 34:48.036
Stay with me!

34:48.103 --> 34:50.004
Help me!

34:50.706 --> 34:53.074
Marco! Tomas!

34:53.143 --> 34:54.476
What's going on out there?

34:54.476 --> 34:56.812
None of the guards are answering.

34:56.880 --> 34:58.780
Let's get out of here.

34:59.916 --> 35:01.816
I've been looking for you.

35:11.060 --> 35:12.627
Chuck!

35:12.628 --> 35:13.729
It really is no use.

35:13.730 --> 35:15.163
He's almost completely gone.

35:15.164 --> 35:17.064
Shutp!

35:19.468 --> 35:21.669
<i>Chuck?</i>

35:21.737 --> 35:23.471
Chuck!

35:23.472 --> 35:25.372
Oh, my God.

35:26.775 --> 35:28.675
Chuck, come on, please wake up.

35:29.579 --> 35:31.113
Chuck, listen to me. I'm here.

35:31.114 --> 35:34.450
Chuck, I'm here.

35:35.685 --> 35:37.585
Chuck, I'm here.

35:42.259 --> 35:45.363
But you're not.

35:45.431 --> 35:46.498
You're not real.

35:46.499 --> 35:47.632
This is a dream.

35:47.633 --> 35:49.768
I came to rescue you.

35:49.836 --> 35:51.736
I'm right here, Chuck.

35:53.373 --> 35:54.973
Chuck, please,

35:54.974 --> 35:56.374
come on.

35:56.375 --> 35:57.742
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

35:57.743 --> 35:59.811
Tell him what you told me before, okay?

35:59.879 --> 36:01.879
He'll hear that, I know it.

36:01.947 --> 36:03.847
This is your chance. Don't-Don't be

36:03.882 --> 36:07.150
Sarah Walker the spy,
be Sarah Walker the girlfriend.

36:07.218 --> 36:08.951
Chuck, please.

36:08.952 --> 36:11.788
Chuck, I love you.

36:11.856 --> 36:13.791
Please wake up.

36:13.859 --> 36:16.560
I have so much that I want to tell you.

36:18.563 --> 36:20.964
I found your proposal plan.

36:21.032 --> 36:22.900
No, no, no, no, no.

36:22.901 --> 36:24.735
This is my mind playing tricks on me.

36:24.736 --> 36:26.537
You don't know anything
about my proposal plan.

36:26.538 --> 36:28.806
You we gonna do it on the beach in Malibu.

36:28.874 --> 36:32.944
Where we watched the sun
rise after our first date.

36:33.012 --> 36:37.082
There were seral race cars involved.

36:37.150 --> 36:39.351
I revised that.

36:39.418 --> 36:41.318
Chuck, I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.

36:41.354 --> 36:46.291
I don't care if you have
the Intersect or not.

36:46.359 --> 36:48.293
Without you, I'm nobody.

36:48.360 --> 36:50.260
I'm nothing but a spy.

36:52.198 --> 36:55.333
Come back to me, Chuck.

36:59.438 --> 37:01.172
I want to marry you.

37:18.092 --> 37:19.992
Chuck.

37:25.031 --> 37:26.965
He's okay. He's okay.

37:29.634 --> 37:31.000
Yeah, he's fine.

37:31.001 --> 37:32.901
Hi.

37:49.085 --> 37:50.752
Bro, are you almost done yet?

37:50.753 --> 37:53.188
Ellie called three times,
see if I figured this thing out.

37:53.255 --> 37:55.423
Well, I'll examine anyone's
dark places for that woman.

37:55.491 --> 37:57.158
I'm at the end of my rope.

37:57.159 --> 38:00.495
Not to worry, my supple
yet hard-bodied friend.

38:00.562 --> 38:02.663
All right, you really
don't need to call me that.

38:02.731 --> 38:04.131
Okay, people, gather,
gather, gather, humans!

38:04.132 --> 38:07.434
You, uh, you minions ready to see

38:07.502 --> 38:09.570
what your broken bodies have wrought?

38:09.638 --> 38:10.638
Do it.

38:10.639 --> 38:12.539
Here goes.

38:16.279 --> 38:18.148
Nice work, amigo.

38:18.149 --> 38:20.049
You did it.

38:22.456 --> 38:23.589
Hmm.

38:23.590 --> 38:25.490
Needs a password.

38:25.959 --> 38:27.259
"Knock knock."

38:27.260 --> 38:29.862
It's an impenetrable riddle.

38:29.930 --> 38:31.097
I could hack it.

38:31.098 --> 38:33.900
Take me about 12 hours, and, uh...

38:33.968 --> 38:35.435
maybe I should try a colonoscopy.

38:35.436 --> 38:36.937
Okay, everyone out now.

38:36.938 --> 38:37.938
Let's go.

38:37.939 --> 38:39.039
We're done.

38:39.040 --> 38:40.707
Thank you. That's no to the colonoscopy?

38:40.708 --> 38:42.442
Congratulations, team.

38:42.443 --> 38:43.777
The Belgian is in custody,

38:43.778 --> 38:45.478
and America's secrets are safe once more.

38:45.479 --> 38:47.447
Oh, yeah, that's what I did today.

38:47.515 --> 38:49.215
Agent Bartowski,

38:49.216 --> 38:50.883
I trust you are feeling better.

38:50.884 --> 38:51.884
Yeah. Uh, yeah.

38:51.885 --> 38:53.018
I- I feel fine.

38:53.019 --> 38:55.920
I'm a little hazy on... everything.

38:55.988 --> 38:58.089
But I'm much better, thank you.

38:58.157 --> 39:00.959
And, Agent Walker, you are back to normal?

39:01.027 --> 39:02.027
Yes, uh...

39:02.028 --> 39:03.662
yes, I am, General.

39:03.663 --> 39:04.797
Very good,

39:04.798 --> 39:07.099
because we have something
important to discuss:

39:07.166 --> 39:09.568
Agent Bartowski's position in the agency

39:09.635 --> 39:10.769
without the Intersect.

39:10.770 --> 39:12.571
Excuse me? The government still wants me?

39:12.572 --> 39:14.573
The Intersect appears to be buried for good,

39:14.640 --> 39:16.308
but we'll find a use for you.

39:16.309 --> 39:18.409
You're an asset with or without it.

39:18.477 --> 39:20.678
Yes, he is.

39:22.080 --> 39:23.346
One last thing.

39:23.347 --> 39:26.182
You're absolutely certain that, even though

39:26.250 --> 39:28.251
the Belgian and Chuck were
both found in Thailand,

39:28.319 --> 39:30.119
that you had nothing to do with

39:30.120 --> 39:32.321
the kidnapped Thai official who woke up

39:32.389 --> 39:34.390
in his own bed this morning,
with no recollection

39:34.457 --> 39:35.991
of where he went for two days?

39:35.992 --> 39:37.160
Hmm?

39:37.161 --> 39:39.061
No, ma'am.

39:39.530 --> 39:41.531
Crazy coincidence.

39:41.599 --> 39:43.800
Welcome back.

39:43.868 --> 39:45.702
I agree.

39:45.703 --> 39:46.703
Welcome back.

39:46.704 --> 39:48.071
Thank you for coming with me.

39:48.072 --> 39:50.206
Beckman knew, right?

39:50.274 --> 39:52.275
I- I think she knew.

39:55.345 --> 39:56.912
Okay, so I still spy.

39:56.913 --> 39:58.913
More importantly, you're home.

40:04.854 --> 40:07.289
Hey, um...

40:07.358 --> 40:09.426
you should know that

40:09.493 --> 40:12.562
the proposal plan that you found-

40:12.630 --> 40:13.630
just a rough draft.

40:13.631 --> 40:16.232
So you do remember what happed?

40:16.300 --> 40:17.500
Yeah, maybe a little.

40:17.501 --> 40:18.968
Uh, a scoche.

40:18.969 --> 40:20.303
But don't think you know

40:20.304 --> 40:22.404
all the surprises that I got hidden

40:22.472 --> 40:24.373
up my sleeves, because my sleeves

40:24.440 --> 40:26.275
are chock-full of surprises.

40:26.276 --> 40:28.543
You know, I'm surprised
I could even get in here

40:28.611 --> 40:31.012
with all the surprises
that are in my sleeves.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.747
I got magic coming your way, baby.

40:32.748 --> 40:34.282
Okay? Magic.

40:34.283 --> 40:35.717
Magic.

40:35.718 --> 40:36.818
I've got no magic.

40:36.819 --> 40:37.819
You ruined my life.

40:37.820 --> 40:38.853
What? I saved your life.

40:38.854 --> 40:40.288
I took a Thai leech for you.

40:40.289 --> 40:42.624
But-But now I can't use
my proposal plan, buddy.

40:42.692 --> 40:44.626
Come on. I need something new.

40:44.694 --> 40:46.862
I need to surprise her,
but how can I surprise a super spy?

40:46.929 --> 40:48.096
Hey, listen, it's fine.

40:48.097 --> 40:49.398
Team Chuck and Morgan have a new mission:

40:49.399 --> 40:50.966
To plan a proposal that'll blow Sarah's mind.

40:50.967 --> 40:52.134
And by the way,

40:52.135 --> 40:53.469
you should've seen Sarah without you.

40:53.470 --> 40:55.370
Man, I mean, maybe it was a good thing

40:55.371 --> 40:57.271
that you lost the Intersect,
'cause now you know

40:57.305 --> 40:58.471
that girl loves you.

40:58.472 --> 40:59.939
I mean, she will do

40:59.940 --> 41:02.107
anything for you.

41:02.175 --> 41:04.210
Thanks, buddy.

41:04.277 --> 41:06.780
Yeah, no, seriously, anything, okay?

41:06.814 --> 41:09.215
I had to pick a Thai tooth out of her arm.

41:09.282 --> 41:10.850
Ow.

41:10.851 --> 41:13.319
I got people who'll take
teeth and leeches for me.

41:13.387 --> 41:14.687
I'm a lucky guy.

41:14.688 --> 41:17.189
It's good having you back.

41:19.058 --> 41:20.559
I'm so happy to be home.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.561
Mm.

41:22.628 --> 41:24.229
And I am so happy to tell you

41:24.230 --> 41:26.064
that you have nothing
left on your plate today.

41:26.065 --> 41:27.065
Okay.

41:27.066 --> 41:28.333
Hi.

41:28.334 --> 41:31.436
Your husband has fixed this computer.

41:31.503 --> 41:34.105
Really?

41:34.172 --> 41:35.306
Oh, you're amazing.

41:35.307 --> 41:38.043
All we need now is a password.

41:38.111 --> 41:40.112
The prompt is "Knock knock."

41:40.179 --> 41:42.447
Know what it could be?

41:42.515 --> 41:44.616
It's not "Who's there."
I already tried that one.

41:47.653 --> 41:50.421
I know what it is.

41:50.489 --> 41:51.922
When I was a little girl,

41:51.923 --> 41:54.758
I would always mess up the
"Knock knock" routine.

41:54.826 --> 41:59.496
My dad would say "Knock knock"
and I would say "I'm here."

42:02.033 --> 42:05.970
It made him laugh so hard I
never wanted to do it right.
