02:36.918 --> 02:38.484
<i>Once there was a band,</i>

02:38.486 --> 02:40.622
<i>three people brought
together by music.</i>

02:42.824 --> 02:44.192
<i>I brought my axe,</i>

02:47.261 --> 02:49.463
<i>Rachel brought her golden voice,</i>

02:52.634 --> 02:54.268
<i>and Scott brought the tunes.</i>

02:55.202 --> 02:58.603
<i>And there was sex, and drugs,
and murder, and mayhem,</i>

02:58.605 --> 03:00.609
<i>and a bunch of other shit
you won't believe.</i>

03:01.808 --> 03:03.408
<i>I wouldn't.</i>

03:04.912 --> 03:08.416
<i>It all started
one dark and stormy night.</i>

03:08.849 --> 03:12.420
<i>I was celebrating my 50th
birthday for the third time.</i>

03:13.220 --> 03:14.622
<i>Who the hell are you people?</i>

03:15.689 --> 03:17.758
<i>And what the hell
are you listening to?</i>

03:18.293 --> 03:20.325
<i>I let my daughter
Chloe sponsor the party</i>

03:20.327 --> 03:21.894
<i>with some vodka company,</i>

03:21.896 --> 03:23.532
<i>just to make a few bucks.</i>

03:23.964 --> 03:25.531
<i>She was a hustler,</i>

03:25.533 --> 03:27.669
<i>a real ball-buster
like her old man.</i>

03:28.969 --> 03:31.973
<i>So of course,
she put on the one song I hate.</i>

03:33.540 --> 03:35.708
<i>You heard this one, haven't you?</i>

03:35.710 --> 03:38.978
<i>Every few years it ends up
in a beer commercial,</i>

03:38.980 --> 03:40.746
<i>number one on the charts,</i>

03:40.748 --> 03:42.884
<i>my one hit, my meal ticket.</i>

03:43.985 --> 03:46.718
<i>I peaked at 20,
and I've been circling</i>

03:46.720 --> 03:48.724
<i>the bowl of this
business ever since.</i>

03:58.866 --> 04:01.003
Yeah, yeah, I'll be happy

04:01.235 --> 04:03.536
if I never had to hear
that fucking song again.

04:03.538 --> 04:05.537
Oh, but it's your birthday,
Pops.

04:05.539 --> 04:07.340
Sorry, sorry.

04:15.015 --> 04:16.482
Are you sure this
is the right house?

04:16.483 --> 04:17.950
Dude, I don't know.
All these houses

04:17.952 --> 04:20.622
in the hills look the same,
so let's just assume it is.

04:21.589 --> 04:22.690
- Pardon me.
- Oh!

04:26.027 --> 04:27.062
Dude!

04:27.462 --> 04:28.727
- What's up?
- This fucking house is sick.

04:28.729 --> 04:29.630
Look at that shit.

04:30.798 --> 04:31.931
Are you shootin'?

04:31.933 --> 04:33.566
Wanna leave your
guitar in the car, man?

04:33.568 --> 04:34.767
Fuck, you know what?

04:34.769 --> 04:35.967
You start playing
Kumbaya for the chicks.

04:35.969 --> 04:37.535
Go fuck yourself, okay?

04:37.537 --> 04:38.907
Stop.

04:40.340 --> 04:41.806
Party over here!

04:48.315 --> 04:49.583
Thank you, sweetie.

04:52.352 --> 04:54.922
<i>Did fate bring them to me
or was it random?</i>

04:55.989 --> 04:57.722
- <i>Who knows?</i>
- What's that?

04:57.724 --> 04:59.558
Turn, turn, turn.
Fuckin' Dirt Pipe,

04:59.560 --> 05:00.859
- remember them?
- Holy shit!

05:00.861 --> 05:02.727
- Yeah, by Jimmy Kleen.
- Jimmy Kleen, yeah, yeah.

05:02.729 --> 05:04.496
He had that hit in the '80s?

05:04.498 --> 05:06.068
- Come on.
- <i>I tell you this much,</i>

05:06.299 --> 05:08.102
<i>opportunity walked
right up to me,</i>

05:08.335 --> 05:10.071
<i>and I almost punched
his lights out.</i>

05:10.604 --> 05:12.106
<i>Story of my life.</i>

05:12.339 --> 05:14.443
Check out those guitars,
dude, that's sick.

05:15.943 --> 05:17.678
Hey, no cameras!

05:21.616 --> 05:22.918
Who the fuck are you guys?

05:25.919 --> 05:27.521
You brought your own guitar?

05:28.356 --> 05:29.391
Come here.

05:30.056 --> 05:31.092
Come over here.

05:34.094 --> 05:36.595
You here to play me your demo?

05:36.597 --> 05:37.698
No.

05:37.998 --> 05:40.501
Then why the fuck are you
at my house, at my party?

05:42.736 --> 05:43.938
I followed a girl here.

05:46.741 --> 05:49.478
That's how I got here, too.

05:50.445 --> 05:51.580
Here, come on, take a seat.

06:01.522 --> 06:02.457
You like that, huh?

06:05.659 --> 06:07.828
The Rickenbacker 12-string.

06:11.498 --> 06:12.666
It's the hollow body.

06:14.769 --> 06:16.100
Harrison had one.

06:16.102 --> 06:17.705
Man knows his scripture.

06:42.429 --> 06:43.097
Can I play it?

06:43.698 --> 06:44.933
Can I fuck your sister?

06:48.969 --> 06:50.005
Play yours.

06:52.806 --> 06:55.710
Come on, destiny awaits.

07:23.871 --> 07:25.039
Who is that?

07:26.140 --> 07:27.776
I was going to ask you.

07:28.575 --> 07:29.743
I have no idea.

07:31.212 --> 07:32.113
Friend of yours?

07:32.914 --> 07:33.815
That's the girl.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.889
You're not going over there,
are you?

07:41.488 --> 07:42.787
It's beautiful.

08:46.853 --> 08:48.022
Hey, where are you going?

08:48.255 --> 08:49.622
I... I can't.

08:49.624 --> 08:50.959
Come on, you just did.

08:51.525 --> 08:52.327
I'm Jimmy.

08:53.193 --> 08:54.261
What's your name?

08:55.895 --> 08:57.128
I'm Rachel.

08:57.130 --> 08:58.297
Hey, come here.

08:58.299 --> 08:59.601
This is...

08:59.799 --> 09:01.870
I'm Scott.

09:03.571 --> 09:04.802
You sounded great.

09:04.804 --> 09:05.906
You, too.

09:06.173 --> 09:07.075
Thanks.

09:07.674 --> 09:08.776
Let her have a seat,

09:09.275 --> 09:10.811
- caveman.
- Sorry, sorry.

09:14.649 --> 09:16.782
Hey,
let me ask you something.

09:16.784 --> 09:18.285
You guys ever been in a band?

09:28.596 --> 09:30.696
<i>I had to get us playing fast,</i>

09:30.698 --> 09:32.266
<i>to see if she had the goods.</i>

09:32.866 --> 09:35.901
<i>I could tell she was skittish,
but she liked Scott,</i>

09:35.903 --> 09:38.373
<i>so I figured I could
control her through him.</i>

09:54.020 --> 09:55.756
Male, female, yeah?

10:05.131 --> 10:06.166
Excuse me.

10:06.833 --> 10:09.103
Come over here.
Excuse me.

10:09.703 --> 10:10.704
Stand here.

10:11.838 --> 10:12.303
No, I don't... I don't wanna be
the center of attention,

10:12.305 --> 10:13.174
I just...

10:14.074 --> 10:15.275
want to be in the band.

10:16.209 --> 10:17.311
You're over here.

10:18.779 --> 10:19.681
You're over here.

10:20.715 --> 10:21.650
So what's a band?

10:22.382 --> 10:24.385
It's a statement, an ethos,

10:24.784 --> 10:26.387
where everything
means something.

10:26.620 --> 10:28.923
Nirvana just didn't happen
to dress like roadies.

10:29.255 --> 10:30.855
That was a decision.

10:30.857 --> 10:33.294
The Beatles bowed after
every song, that was a choice.

10:33.961 --> 10:36.698
You know, it's all calculated.
It's all created.

10:37.798 --> 10:38.997
It's all about the concept.

10:38.999 --> 10:41.970
And our concept
centers around you.

10:45.172 --> 10:46.939
You're in charge,
you're the front man.

10:46.941 --> 10:48.072
No, no, no, no, no.

10:48.074 --> 10:49.443
I'm the band leader.

10:50.276 --> 10:52.210
The front man
stands in the front,

10:52.212 --> 10:53.747
you engage the audience.

10:54.115 --> 10:55.183
I'm the band leader.

10:56.015 --> 10:57.184
I'm with the band,

10:57.650 --> 10:58.883
keep the train on schedule.

10:58.885 --> 11:00.886
Our concept was
never just her.

11:00.888 --> 11:02.186
- Yeah.
- It's us.

11:02.188 --> 11:03.857
We are a band, we are one.

11:04.058 --> 11:06.327
But it's not Hollow Bodies,
it's Hollow Body.

11:06.760 --> 11:07.861
Trust me.

11:08.194 --> 11:09.327
You're the star.

11:09.329 --> 11:11.065
We want every girl
to want to be her

11:11.298 --> 11:12.998
and all the guys
want to fuck her.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.003
We want every girl
to want to fuck you.

11:16.437 --> 11:17.772
All right, fine.

11:19.005 --> 11:21.440
Well, band leader....

11:21.442 --> 11:23.178
- Yeah.
- What do you want to start with?

11:23.677 --> 11:26.147
Let's start with "Perfect Day,"
seems fitting.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.015
All right.

11:29.183 --> 11:30.452
One, two...

11:30.683 --> 11:31.419
That's my part.

11:33.419 --> 11:36.187
One, two, three, four.

11:44.198 --> 11:45.933
<i>Scott was easy to figure out.</i>

11:46.699 --> 11:48.102
<i>I was him, once.</i>

11:50.337 --> 11:52.874
<i>Trying to balance
the work with the wife.</i>

11:54.107 --> 11:55.776
<i>Something's gotta give.</i>

11:56.943 --> 11:58.813
<i>What's her name, this girl?</i>

12:00.847 --> 12:02.183
Rachel.

12:03.350 --> 12:04.753
How old is she?

12:05.318 --> 12:06.484
I don't know.

12:06.486 --> 12:07.920
What, you were there all night

12:07.922 --> 12:09.324
and you don't know
how old she is?

12:10.256 --> 12:13.024
What am I, on trial now, Carrie?
I mean...

12:15.829 --> 12:17.030
Okay, um...

12:19.933 --> 12:22.403
It's just... It's just strange.

12:24.270 --> 12:25.305
You trust me.

12:26.273 --> 12:27.207
I trust you.

12:29.108 --> 12:30.244
I would never...

12:31.377 --> 12:33.480
never do anything
to mess this up.

12:44.191 --> 12:46.327
<i>♪ What can I say? ♪</i>

12:46.927 --> 12:47.861
See?

12:49.295 --> 12:53.433
<i>♪ I love you in every way ♪</i>

12:54.834 --> 12:58.436
<i>♪ It's just a perfect day ♪</i>

13:01.442 --> 13:03.474

13:03.476 --> 13:04.846
Thanks.

13:07.780 --> 13:10.481
<i>And then there was
Rachel and Barb.</i>

13:10.483 --> 13:12.052
<i>I hadn't counted on Barb.</i>

13:13.353 --> 13:14.952
<i>Stage mom.</i>

13:14.954 --> 13:18.193
<i>Barb's been pimping Rachel out
for a long time now.</i>

13:19.559 --> 13:22.963
<i>She's a grown-up version of
the kind of groupie you'd see.</i>

13:23.898 --> 13:27.068
<i>Do anything or anyone
to get on the bus.</i>

13:29.035 --> 13:31.972
Shouldn't you not be
drinking with your medicine?

13:32.305 --> 13:34.007
Don't you worry about me.

13:34.241 --> 13:35.843
I'm going to outlive all of you.

13:37.410 --> 13:38.979
How old did he say he was?

13:40.246 --> 13:41.248
Who?

13:41.881 --> 13:42.983
That Scott.

13:46.286 --> 13:47.418
I don't know.

13:47.420 --> 13:48.589
Well, is he 40?

13:49.390 --> 13:50.592
He's 33.

13:50.957 --> 13:53.392
Isn't that old to be still
doing this, don't you think?

13:53.394 --> 13:54.960
Jimmy's 50-something.

13:54.962 --> 13:56.865
Well, he's a name.

13:57.463 --> 13:58.532
He has connections.

13:59.967 --> 14:01.401
What has Scott got?

14:02.035 --> 14:02.936
Talent.

14:06.439 --> 14:07.975
What do you know about him?

14:10.843 --> 14:12.646
He's married.
He's got a baby.

14:13.614 --> 14:15.617
A husband and a father.

14:16.049 --> 14:18.285
How's he supporting his
family while he's doing this?

14:18.584 --> 14:19.887
Why do you care?

14:22.423 --> 14:26.193
Sweetheart, I'm just
making sure you're protected.

14:32.098 --> 14:32.967
It's special.

14:34.300 --> 14:38.039
These entertainment people,
you know what they can be like.

14:51.418 --> 14:53.118
<i>I had my own problems.</i>

14:53.120 --> 14:55.320
<i>I'm underwater
in this stupid house</i>

14:55.322 --> 14:58.456
<i>and I have to go beg
from Richie Rolands.</i>

14:58.458 --> 15:01.258
<i>Richie runs
a multinational media empire</i>

15:01.260 --> 15:03.295
<i>that he inherited from his dad,</i>

15:03.297 --> 15:05.466
<i>who I once made
a ton of cash for.</i>

15:05.899 --> 15:08.436
<i>Now I got to go kiss
Junior's ring.</i>

15:09.135 --> 15:10.404
So who's fucking her?

15:10.670 --> 15:11.636
You?

15:11.638 --> 15:12.573
This guy?

15:13.740 --> 15:15.443
Is she a tomcat in the sack?
What's the deal? Talk to me.

15:16.643 --> 15:18.246
A tomcat's a male cat.

15:19.346 --> 15:21.149
Just listen to the track.

15:21.515 --> 15:24.115
Just send me the link.
You want me to listen to it

15:24.117 --> 15:26.551
on your bullshit phone speakers?
Come on, man.

15:26.553 --> 15:29.222
- Well, come up to the studio.
- I got to go in a minute.

15:30.124 --> 15:32.324
Listen, I'm not her dad.

15:32.326 --> 15:34.526
If she wants to fuck you,
she can fuck you.

15:34.528 --> 15:36.327
That's why you're not
fucking her, right?

15:36.329 --> 15:38.065
Because you're like
her dad or something?

15:39.632 --> 15:42.369
Hell, man, you look like shit.

15:43.404 --> 15:45.106
How are you living like this?

15:45.371 --> 15:47.474
I mean, what's going on?

15:47.941 --> 15:50.678
Yeah, I don't know.

15:51.310 --> 15:54.079
I'm getting fat
and my house is falling apart.

15:56.316 --> 15:58.119
Everything just went to shit
after this bitch left me.

15:58.485 --> 16:00.018
How did Chloe take it?

16:00.020 --> 16:03.091
Oh, that's not Chloe's mom,
that was the one before.

16:03.723 --> 16:05.759
You know,
but Chloe threw a party,

16:05.992 --> 16:07.625
she burned her furs in effigy.

16:07.627 --> 16:09.629
Chip off the old block, huh?

16:11.365 --> 16:13.534
Well, I'll give you this,
she's got a look.

16:13.967 --> 16:16.103
- She's got it all.
- So what?

16:16.702 --> 16:18.737
I mean, how many YouTube subs
does she have?

16:18.739 --> 16:20.338
What kind of metrics
are we talking about?

16:20.340 --> 16:23.307
Come on, man, that's the way
things are going these days,

16:23.309 --> 16:25.343
- you got to keep up.
- Now, don't give me that.

16:25.345 --> 16:28.113
She is gold and I can spot gold.

16:28.115 --> 16:29.350
Come on, Richie.

16:30.317 --> 16:31.219
You know...

16:32.452 --> 16:35.387
the last time you called me
Richie, I was an unpaid intern

16:35.389 --> 16:37.455
and you were too fucking high
to remember my name.

16:37.457 --> 16:40.193
So try and remember now,
now it's Rick.

16:41.327 --> 16:43.295
Sorry, Rick.

16:43.297 --> 16:45.133
You're just not that memorable.

16:45.399 --> 16:46.565
She is.

16:46.567 --> 16:47.802
Well, see, the thing is,

16:48.034 --> 16:49.500
and you don't seem
to be getting this,

16:49.502 --> 16:52.237
is I don't really do
A & R anymore, okay?

16:52.239 --> 16:54.372
I'm launching a music
streaming platform,

16:54.374 --> 16:56.411
I'm not trying to
sign your little band.

16:56.677 --> 16:58.676
And just a bit of advice:

16:58.678 --> 17:00.378
you should move on.

17:00.380 --> 17:03.148
You're fucking 50, all right?

17:03.150 --> 17:04.714
Have you looked
in a mirror lately?

17:04.717 --> 17:07.087
You can't be out there
shaking your ass.

17:08.255 --> 17:11.224
That's why I need this to work.

17:12.792 --> 17:15.459
Why'd you even
come over anyway, then?

17:15.461 --> 17:18.463
I came over here out of
respect to our friendship,

17:18.464 --> 17:19.699
because we go way back.

17:21.167 --> 17:23.267
And my physical therapist
is right around the corner,

17:23.269 --> 17:24.671
he's actually Geffen's guy.

17:31.445 --> 17:32.813
All right, look.

17:33.045 --> 17:34.212
I know a guy,

17:34.214 --> 17:36.180
he's always looking
for opening acts.

17:36.182 --> 17:37.749
Maybe I can get you
a West Coast tour

17:37.751 --> 17:39.583
or something,
how does that sound?

17:39.585 --> 17:41.588
- Yeah, we can do that.
- No frills.

17:42.188 --> 17:43.754
I don't care about
accommodations.

17:43.756 --> 17:45.557
All I care about are advances.

17:45.559 --> 17:47.725
Fifty grand or something.

17:47.727 --> 17:49.831
Oh, an advance?
You want an advance?

17:50.063 --> 17:51.530
What is this, 1989?

17:51.532 --> 17:53.665
Get 500,000 Instagram followers

17:53.667 --> 17:55.833
and then talk to me
about an advance.

17:55.835 --> 17:57.404
Ten grand, anything?

17:59.105 --> 18:00.440
I love you, man.

18:01.140 --> 18:03.276
I really do,
I get a kick out of ya.

18:03.776 --> 18:06.546
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
text you the guy's info.

18:07.346 --> 18:09.150
And I'm going to send
my maids over.

18:11.317 --> 18:13.621
Thanks, Richie.

18:14.621 --> 18:15.523
Rick.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.395
It's time to start playing out.

18:23.397 --> 18:24.332
You hear me?

18:25.298 --> 18:26.400
- Already?
- Yeah.

18:31.271 --> 18:32.704
Don't you think it's too soon?

18:32.706 --> 18:34.675
I mean, yeah,
are you sure we're ready?

18:34.874 --> 18:37.242
It's the only way
to spread the word.

18:37.244 --> 18:39.476
It's the only way
to really get good.

18:39.478 --> 18:40.515
All right.

18:40.714 --> 18:42.246
Yeah, when we play out,
there's no safety net.

18:42.248 --> 18:43.918
We don't have guitar techs,

18:44.150 --> 18:45.684
so you have to tune,
change your strings,

18:45.686 --> 18:48.820
hook up the PA, you got to
be good, you got to be fast.

18:48.822 --> 18:49.890
All right?

18:50.122 --> 18:51.491
And you have to
command the stage.

18:52.325 --> 18:54.194
They're there to see
a performance.

18:55.896 --> 18:57.231
Something they'll remember.

19:30.796 --> 19:32.933
<i>♪ It's just a perfect day ♪</i>

19:33.166 --> 19:35.634
<i>♪ You make the world
worth fighting for ♪</i>

19:35.636 --> 19:38.235
<i>♪ It's just a perfect day ♪</i>

19:38.237 --> 19:40.941
<i>♪ You make the world
worth fighting for ♪</i>

19:41.173 --> 19:45.812
<i>♪ It's just a perfect day ♪</i>

19:49.515 --> 19:50.784
All right, let's do it again.

19:54.454 --> 19:57.959
- Uh, can I help you?
- Oh, uh, the door was open.

19:58.190 --> 20:00.327
- I'm here for Rachel.
- Oh, you must be her mom.

20:00.826 --> 20:01.826
Barb.

20:01.828 --> 20:02.997
I'm Jimmy.

20:03.496 --> 20:04.966
Well, you're in
pretty good shape

20:05.198 --> 20:07.264
for an older guy.

20:07.266 --> 20:08.736
Older than what?

20:09.236 --> 20:11.772
I'm probably the oldest woman
that's ever been in this house.

20:12.438 --> 20:13.838
I wouldn't say that exactly.

20:16.409 --> 20:18.376
You raised
quite a talented daughter.

20:18.378 --> 20:20.514
Yes, I did.

20:22.983 --> 20:25.019
You look kind of
beat up in this one.

20:25.986 --> 20:27.686
That was a long time ago.

20:27.688 --> 20:30.554
And yet, there it is
on the wall like you miss it.

20:30.556 --> 20:32.459
More of a cautionary tale.

20:33.994 --> 20:37.361
We all carry the seeds of
our own destruction, Mr. Klein.

20:37.363 --> 20:38.565
You're telling me.

20:41.234 --> 20:42.270
Mom?

20:43.370 --> 20:44.636
What are you doing here?

20:44.638 --> 20:46.506
Oh, honey,
I thought we could have lunch.

20:47.239 --> 20:48.572
Hi, I'm Scott.

20:48.574 --> 20:49.976
You're the writer.

20:51.911 --> 20:53.980
I can see why she likes you.

20:54.514 --> 20:55.780
Well, I mean,

20:55.782 --> 20:57.518
actually we kind of
all write the songs.

20:57.918 --> 20:59.486
Some of them are quite good.

20:59.886 --> 21:00.788
Thanks.

21:01.321 --> 21:02.923
But where is this all going?

21:03.489 --> 21:05.058
Well, I wasn't
going to mention this

21:05.292 --> 21:06.660
but since you're here,

21:07.460 --> 21:09.029
there is label interest

21:09.262 --> 21:10.998
and a few touring dates.

21:11.531 --> 21:12.731
A tour?

21:12.733 --> 21:13.701
Just West Coast dates.

21:13.934 --> 21:15.567
So, is this part
of a record deal?

21:15.569 --> 21:18.336
No, there's nothing concrete,
there's no advance.

21:18.338 --> 21:20.638
It's just for some exposure.

21:20.640 --> 21:23.444
- Twelve dates, fourteen days.
- Hm.

21:23.642 --> 21:26.380
Look, I'm just not
sure about all this.

21:26.979 --> 21:28.982
Come on, haven't you ever
road-tripped before?

21:29.548 --> 21:30.517
Every summer.

21:31.051 --> 21:32.053
Perfect.

21:34.321 --> 21:36.323
We have to talk about this,
Rachel.

21:37.357 --> 21:38.926
Let's go,
say goodbye to your friends.

21:42.027 --> 21:44.728
<i>Ah, Barb,
playing hard to get.</i>

21:46.733 --> 21:48.336
<i>We hit the road
two weeks after that,</i>

21:49.034 --> 21:50.103
<i>one last run.</i>

21:51.405 --> 21:52.807
<i>Getting out there again,</i>

21:53.305 --> 21:54.408
<i>I got excited.</i>

21:54.775 --> 21:56.744
<i>I thought maybe
my luck had changed.</i>

21:57.476 --> 21:58.345
<i>It did.</i>

22:00.045 --> 22:01.047
<i>It got worse.</i>

22:09.054 --> 22:09.957
How are you doing?

22:12.726 --> 22:14.495
All right, listen,
this is the perfect crowd.

22:15.061 --> 22:16.927
They're just drunk enough.

22:16.929 --> 22:18.131
Good training wheels.

22:19.466 --> 22:21.502
Just seems
like a lot of people.

22:23.503 --> 22:26.439
I once played to 40,000
people on three hits of acid.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.840
No, you didn't.

22:28.842 --> 22:30.878
Yeah, that's what they told me.

22:31.945 --> 22:33.911
I don't remember shit
but if I can do that,

22:33.913 --> 22:34.914
you can do this.

22:36.082 --> 22:38.486
Look at that guy,
do you even care what he thinks?

22:41.688 --> 22:43.491
It's just like rehearsal,
all right?

22:44.423 --> 22:45.158
Okay.

22:45.391 --> 22:46.690
Do you trust me?

22:46.692 --> 22:47.692
No.

22:47.694 --> 22:49.060
Well, good.

22:49.062 --> 22:51.064
That's 'cause you're smart.

22:51.997 --> 22:54.965
Look, here, it's going to get
hot under the lights.

22:54.967 --> 22:57.001
You're going to have
to take this off.

22:57.003 --> 22:57.938
Jimmy.

22:58.638 --> 22:59.874
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

23:01.041 --> 23:02.176
You look beautiful.

23:02.409 --> 23:03.143
Thanks.

23:03.376 --> 23:04.578
See, I told you.

23:04.777 --> 23:05.678
Okay.

23:06.111 --> 23:07.611
You're on.

23:07.613 --> 23:08.915
All right, let's go, guys.

23:24.531 --> 23:25.765
Hey, we're Hollow Body.

23:26.131 --> 23:27.567
And we're from Los Angeles.

23:32.605 --> 23:34.038
"Perfect Day."

23:34.040 --> 23:37.007
One, two, three, four.

24:47.179 --> 24:48.649
Are you okay?

24:53.186 --> 24:56.053
Do you guys think
I like the road?

24:56.055 --> 24:57.754
Carrying my own gear?

24:57.756 --> 24:59.726
Bad food and truck stop shits?

25:00.560 --> 25:02.260
No, but that's the road.

25:02.262 --> 25:04.598
You do your fucking job
and you get on with it.

25:04.965 --> 25:06.567
Dude, she had a bad night.

25:06.932 --> 25:09.634
Yeah, well you better get
your shit together, honey,

25:09.636 --> 25:11.305
'cause Mommy's not here
to fucking help you anymore.

25:11.537 --> 25:13.271
She gets it,
just give her time.

25:13.273 --> 25:15.074
Oh, time?
Let me tell you about time.

25:15.574 --> 25:17.908
You're 33 years old
with a wife and a kid.

25:17.910 --> 25:19.279
She's 23 years old.

25:19.512 --> 25:22.249
She's got five or six more
fuck-ups in her life.

25:22.649 --> 25:24.118
You have no Plan B.

25:24.650 --> 25:26.620
And this is Plan A.

25:29.255 --> 25:31.257
Fucking bullshit.

25:32.225 --> 25:34.024
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
- No, hey, hey,

25:34.026 --> 25:36.063
don't listen to that
fucking dickhead.

25:36.528 --> 25:37.564
Bullshit.

25:38.031 --> 25:39.296
Put that fucking camera down

25:39.298 --> 25:41.067
or I'll stick it up
your fucking ass.

25:42.869 --> 25:44.271
Think he's fucking Scorsese.

25:50.310 --> 25:51.245
Goddamn it!

25:55.849 --> 25:57.051
Shit!

26:02.656 --> 26:03.855
What the hell's the problem now?

26:03.857 --> 26:05.857
It's the battery.
Neil said it was touchy.

26:05.859 --> 26:06.894
It's not fucking working.

26:07.927 --> 26:09.127
Nice.

26:09.129 --> 26:11.298
This was a fucking
embarrassment in there.

26:11.730 --> 26:13.630
I had to pull
favors for that gig.

26:13.632 --> 26:16.035
- It makes me look bad.
- Next time, she'll be ready.

26:16.602 --> 26:17.438
Next time?

26:17.670 --> 26:19.372
There isn't gonna be
a next time.

26:19.605 --> 26:22.241
If she can't tour,
it's fucking done.

26:23.008 --> 26:24.876
I'll sing lead
for a couple of shows.

26:24.878 --> 26:26.209
It's not a big deal!

26:26.211 --> 26:29.115
You think the frat boys
came out to see you?

26:31.618 --> 26:33.787
Listen,
you're just along for the ride.

26:34.153 --> 26:36.053
You're a decent songwriter,

26:36.055 --> 26:38.755
an okay singer,
and quite frankly,

26:38.757 --> 26:40.157
- a shitty guitarist.
- You know what?

26:40.159 --> 26:41.658
- You know what I'm good at?
- What?

26:41.660 --> 26:43.360
Getting her
to put up with your bullshit.

26:43.362 --> 26:44.795
You're just a fucking has-been

26:44.797 --> 26:46.798
who hasn't written
a goddamn good song

26:46.800 --> 26:48.369
in 20 fucking years.

26:48.601 --> 26:49.801
Well, bite me!

26:49.803 --> 26:51.369
Finally we get
some focus back!

26:51.371 --> 26:53.705
Fuck you,
you fucking piece of shit!

26:53.707 --> 26:54.408
Fuck you.

26:55.409 --> 26:58.712
I like seeing you
get mad, finally.

26:58.977 --> 27:00.279
Fuck off, Zach!

27:06.852 --> 27:07.854
Your mommy's here.

27:09.988 --> 27:10.990
Okay, this?

27:11.190 --> 27:12.292
All this...

27:12.891 --> 27:13.794
is over.

27:15.027 --> 27:17.030
This is all too much for her.

27:17.697 --> 27:19.766
So sweetheart,
let's just go home.

27:22.267 --> 27:23.269
Get in the car.

27:25.104 --> 27:26.005
Now.

27:37.417 --> 27:38.318
Rachel.

27:42.388 --> 27:43.924
Are you all right?

28:09.415 --> 28:10.751
Jesus fuck!

28:16.156 --> 28:19.059
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel!

29:08.842 --> 29:10.843
<i>I understand second chances.</i>

29:11.210 --> 29:13.176
<i>I've almost died a few times.</i>

29:13.178 --> 29:16.046
<i>Overdose here, overdose there,</i>

29:16.048 --> 29:17.450
<i>stabbed in prison even.</i>

29:19.084 --> 29:20.319
<i>There's no white light.</i>

29:22.054 --> 29:23.422
<i>But Rachel's not like me.</i>

29:24.157 --> 29:25.425
<i>She's fragile.</i>

29:28.328 --> 29:29.463
<i>This could have broke her.</i>

29:46.946 --> 29:50.214
<i>Or maybe Barb dying
would finally set Rachel free.</i>

29:56.155 --> 29:59.259
<i>Man, was I wrong about that.</i>

30:01.361 --> 30:04.297
<i>So you think after that
she'd take it easy.</i>

30:05.297 --> 30:06.199
<i>Wrong.</i>

30:07.467 --> 30:09.300
<i>She went crazy.</i>

30:12.438 --> 30:16.176
<i>And of course Chloe was there
to enable all her bad behavior.</i>

30:16.542 --> 30:18.111
- Here.
- <i>I get it.</i>

30:18.410 --> 30:20.948
<i>Cheat death,
you don't cash out,</i>

30:21.948 --> 30:23.249
<i>you double down.</i>

30:30.857 --> 30:31.892
Wow.

30:33.825 --> 30:35.158
You never did that before.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.930
There's a lot of things
I've never done before, huh?

30:39.599 --> 30:41.968
Yes,
another proof of concept, yes.

30:43.002 --> 30:45.405
I'm going to try every
single one of them.

30:49.842 --> 30:51.911
Good, you ready to go on?

30:52.512 --> 30:55.115
No, that part still scares me.

30:55.881 --> 30:57.013
You've got this.

30:57.015 --> 30:58.182
You just need to, like,

30:58.184 --> 30:59.987
loosen up a little bit,

31:01.019 --> 31:02.221
and don't get too drunk.

31:03.555 --> 31:05.992
I kind of like getting drunk.

31:09.495 --> 31:10.530
Do you wanna...

31:12.165 --> 31:13.066
try something?

31:17.169 --> 31:18.272
Like what?

31:24.310 --> 31:25.212
Like him?

31:29.082 --> 31:30.449
You want me to...

31:31.918 --> 31:32.686
Yes.

31:33.753 --> 31:36.387
Go, kiss a stranger.
Just make out with somebody.

31:36.389 --> 31:37.556
Work off some of this...

31:38.390 --> 31:39.525
nervous energy.

31:42.094 --> 31:44.964
I've got to go.
Hey, don't take too long.

31:46.064 --> 31:47.167
You're on soon.

31:48.301 --> 31:50.169
- Yeah.
- If you don't, I will.

31:55.574 --> 31:57.177
Oh, my God.

32:12.492 --> 32:13.527
Hi.

32:14.393 --> 32:15.294
Hi.

32:21.700 --> 32:22.736
Sorry, um...

32:28.640 --> 32:29.543
Oh.

32:31.576 --> 32:33.112
Hey, you okay?

32:36.015 --> 32:37.050
You okay?

32:39.451 --> 32:40.619
You all right?

32:58.004 --> 32:59.369
Dude, this thing is amazing.

32:59.371 --> 33:01.205
Yeah, just don't mess it up.

33:01.207 --> 33:02.572
Stacey's not allowed
at this event.

33:02.574 --> 33:03.640
I'll be gentle.

33:03.642 --> 33:05.111
I don't like her,
make her leave.

33:05.644 --> 33:07.645
Thanks for setting this up,
baby.

33:07.647 --> 33:09.649
Oh, please,
I'm doing this for Rachel.

33:10.082 --> 33:11.118
Not you, old man.

33:11.684 --> 33:13.716
This is what you have
to look forward to

33:13.718 --> 33:15.086
when you get older.

33:15.088 --> 33:16.757
No, he looks like
he's probably a good dad.

33:18.390 --> 33:20.459
As long as he doesn't
keep hanging out with you.

33:20.993 --> 33:22.729
That's my girl.

34:15.614 --> 34:17.350
Rachel, we're on.

34:27.693 --> 34:28.594
Coming.

34:35.300 --> 34:36.699
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:36.702 --> 34:38.801
next up, we have...

34:38.803 --> 34:40.206
Hollow Body.

34:44.275 --> 34:45.643
Hey, we're Hollow Body.

34:47.079 --> 34:48.380
Don't kill animals...

34:49.282 --> 34:50.780
unless they have
it coming to them.

34:50.782 --> 34:52.181
Porky!

34:52.184 --> 34:54.853
And the star of our show,
Ms. Rachel Swann!

35:00.526 --> 35:01.394
What's this?

35:02.360 --> 35:03.863
Thought we could
try something new.

35:04.597 --> 35:05.799
Okay.

35:06.298 --> 35:07.501
All right, fellas.

35:07.767 --> 35:09.402
How's everybody feeling
out there?

35:10.202 --> 35:12.505
All right, she wants to try
something new here.

35:12.704 --> 35:14.437
Something new?
Are you fucking kidding me?

35:14.439 --> 35:17.276
Yeah, don't worry,
it's easy, it's in A.

35:17.610 --> 35:20.311
Just put your big boy pants on.
This is rock and roll.

35:20.313 --> 35:21.579
Let's go, guys.

35:21.581 --> 35:22.546

39:27.726 --> 39:29.595
Hey.

39:29.829 --> 39:31.061
You about ready?

39:31.063 --> 39:32.829
Yeah,
she's fine, she's just drunk.

39:32.831 --> 39:33.732
Whoa.

39:34.700 --> 39:36.499
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

39:36.501 --> 39:37.934
Whoa, whoa.

39:37.936 --> 39:39.470
Back up, back up,
give her some air.

39:39.472 --> 39:41.004
Hey, you all right?
You okay?

39:41.006 --> 39:42.071
Did you take something?

39:42.073 --> 39:43.842
I don't know.
How did I do that?

39:45.510 --> 39:46.809
Come on, all right.

39:46.811 --> 39:47.845
How did I do that?

39:47.847 --> 39:49.178
Come on,
come on, come on.

39:49.180 --> 39:50.617
All right,
nothing to see here. Come on.

39:51.483 --> 39:52.582
Let's go.

39:52.584 --> 39:54.052
Dude,
turn that fucking thing off!

39:54.787 --> 39:56.787
<i>Now that I
knew she could deliver,</i>

39:56.789 --> 39:58.955
<i>I had to get Rick on board.</i>

39:58.957 --> 40:01.059
<i>He'd been avoiding me
after our last fuck up,</i>

40:01.593 --> 40:03.729
<i>but I knew the bartender
at his favorite restaurant.</i>

40:06.731 --> 40:09.032
- Ricky!
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.

40:09.034 --> 40:10.903
You don't write,
you don't call?

40:12.070 --> 40:13.769
We got nothing
to talk about, okay?

40:13.771 --> 40:15.738
I gave you a shot, right?

40:15.740 --> 40:18.075
- You blew it.
- No, look at this, look at this.

40:18.077 --> 40:19.542
Struck by lightning.

40:19.544 --> 40:20.776
Dead for three hours.

40:20.778 --> 40:22.479
Her mom killed
right next to her.

40:22.481 --> 40:24.715
It's a rock and roll tragedy.
I saw the whole thing.

40:24.717 --> 40:25.849
She died?

40:25.851 --> 40:28.488
Yeah, and then she
came back to life

40:28.720 --> 40:30.086
for our sins.

40:30.088 --> 40:31.187
That's quite a lot for you.

40:31.189 --> 40:33.090
Congratulations.

40:33.092 --> 40:35.791
For me?
This guy,

40:35.793 --> 40:37.126
- we had some times.
- Oh, yeah?

40:37.128 --> 40:39.062
- Crazy times, yeah.
- All right, let me talk to you.

40:39.064 --> 40:40.731
- Yeah, what's your name?
- Tracey.

40:40.733 --> 40:43.169
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
Jimmy, nice to meet you.

40:43.434 --> 40:44.968
- Have we met before?
- No.

40:44.970 --> 40:46.105
- No?
- What do you need?

40:46.472 --> 40:47.803
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Vegas or something?

40:47.805 --> 40:49.840
No, why are you
doing this to me?

40:49.842 --> 40:52.845
Just give it a listen, please.

40:53.044 --> 40:54.144
Why?

40:54.146 --> 40:55.745
Come on,
we got a bunch of new songs.

40:55.747 --> 40:57.747
There's a clip
from her performance.

40:57.749 --> 40:58.782
Why?

40:58.784 --> 41:00.182
She's possessed, it's crazy.

41:00.184 --> 41:01.517
I'm telling you.

41:03.088 --> 41:05.521
You want me to get on
my knees or something?

41:05.523 --> 41:06.990
Yeah, I do.

41:06.992 --> 41:09.863
I've been on my knees
since I got into this business.

41:10.128 --> 41:11.663
Come on, just give it a listen.

41:12.932 --> 41:13.933
All right.

41:14.999 --> 41:15.901
I'll do that.

41:16.702 --> 41:17.904
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

41:18.537 --> 41:19.769
Take it easy, man.

41:19.771 --> 41:21.704
Stop doing this, okay?
You're all frantic.

41:21.706 --> 41:22.905
- All right.
- You seem crazy.

41:22.907 --> 41:23.809
Thanks, Rick.

41:24.175 --> 41:25.177
Tracey, pleasure.

41:25.677 --> 41:26.545
Whoa.

41:38.590 --> 41:39.291
Okay.

41:45.030 --> 41:46.232
<i>Hey, what you doing?</i>

41:46.764 --> 41:48.000
Daddy duty.

41:48.267 --> 41:51.167
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

41:53.238 --> 41:55.575
<i>Oh, I remember when
Chloe was that young,</i>

41:56.140 --> 41:58.140
<i>that little soft
spot on her head.</i>

41:58.142 --> 42:00.280
You ever think you'd
have a 20-year-old?

42:00.512 --> 42:02.314
<i>I never thought
I'd live to be 20.</i>

42:03.749 --> 42:06.785
<i>So, I know you're all cozy
there and everything, but...</i>

42:07.785 --> 42:09.186
<i>we need you over here.</i>

42:09.188 --> 42:10.289
Right now?

42:10.521 --> 42:12.055
<i>Yeah, uh, Rachel's coming over.</i>

42:12.057 --> 42:14.591
<i>I need to redo the guitar parts,</i>

42:14.593 --> 42:15.691
<i>we need harmonies.</i>

42:15.693 --> 42:17.930
<i>So, get your ass over here.</i>

42:18.530 --> 42:19.832
Jimmy, dude, it's late.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.166
<i>Yeah, you know what, I get it.</i>

42:23.168 --> 42:24.667
<i>It's cool.</i>

42:24.669 --> 42:26.870
<i>I'll just call my buddy,
Owen, up.</i>

42:26.872 --> 42:28.204
<i>He's an amazing guitar player.</i>

42:28.206 --> 42:30.609
<i>He could probably sing
some harmonies, too.</i>

42:34.613 --> 42:36.046
Okay, all right.

42:36.048 --> 42:37.713
<i>That's my boy.</i>

42:37.715 --> 42:38.750
<i>See you soon.</i>

42:41.619 --> 42:42.322
Take her?

42:47.693 --> 42:50.095
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

42:51.697 --> 42:53.095
It's all right.

42:57.202 --> 42:58.303
Baby, you seen my keys?

42:59.137 --> 43:02.074
Uh, yeah, here.

43:03.242 --> 43:04.343
Where are you going?

43:05.744 --> 43:06.646
Jimmy's.

43:07.845 --> 43:08.880
You didn't say this...

43:09.715 --> 43:11.050
was an every-night thing.

43:11.650 --> 43:12.684
It's not.

43:13.619 --> 43:14.687
I miss you.

43:16.088 --> 43:18.055
After a long day
of taking care of her,

43:18.057 --> 43:20.959
I need someone
to take care of me, too.

43:26.798 --> 43:27.699
I miss us.

43:29.267 --> 43:32.035
I mean, you're either sleeping

43:32.037 --> 43:33.039
or you're with her.

43:34.139 --> 43:36.008
She'll sleep through
the night soon.

43:38.376 --> 43:39.277
Carrie...

43:41.880 --> 43:43.316
We haven't had sex in months.

43:45.718 --> 43:48.221
Is that why you stay
over there until 4:00 a.m.?

43:51.622 --> 43:52.659
No.

43:54.193 --> 43:55.395
Jimmy likes to work late.

43:55.626 --> 43:57.095
Jimmy, and...?

43:57.930 --> 43:58.865
Rachel.

44:00.131 --> 44:01.698
And you're with her

44:01.700 --> 44:03.166
and some pervy old guy.

44:03.168 --> 44:04.133
Pervy?

44:04.135 --> 44:05.102
Carrie, come on.

44:05.104 --> 44:06.336
I looked him up.

44:06.338 --> 44:09.409
Okay, so he's someone
you can look up.

44:09.640 --> 44:10.976
Maybe that's all
you need to know.

44:11.677 --> 44:12.378
Okay.

44:17.182 --> 44:18.084
I'm sorry.

44:18.816 --> 44:19.952
Look, it's just...

44:23.921 --> 44:26.425
This is a once
in a lifetime thing for me.

44:30.428 --> 44:31.329
This...

44:33.030 --> 44:34.332
this right here...

44:35.867 --> 44:37.936
is a once in a lifetime thing.

45:00.258 --> 45:02.024
<i>...is about to pound this area</i>

45:02.026 --> 45:03.926
<i>with some gusty winds,
torrential rain,</i>

45:03.928 --> 45:06.296
<i>and a lot of lightning,
unfortunately.</i>

45:06.298 --> 45:07.930
<i>And of course,
people who are outside...</i>

45:15.474 --> 45:17.876
<i>I could've stopped it,
but I didn't.</i>

45:18.477 --> 45:19.779
<i>She made him better.</i>

45:20.311 --> 45:23.048
<i>When she changed,
we all changed.</i>

46:00.352 --> 46:02.421
<i>She was a force of nature.</i>

46:02.820 --> 46:04.923
<i>Hell, she even
started booking gigs.</i>

46:05.456 --> 46:06.958
<i>She got us a wedding</i>

46:07.459 --> 46:10.026
<i>that paid ten grand
for one night.</i>

46:10.028 --> 46:11.197
<i>I'm not too proud.</i>

46:37.856 --> 46:38.957
<i>What's gotten into her?</i>

46:39.858 --> 46:41.593
Girl's got the devil in her.

46:42.093 --> 46:43.296
And a liter of vodka.

46:44.229 --> 46:46.232
It's like she's
a completely different person.

46:46.798 --> 46:48.097
She'll say something,

46:48.099 --> 46:50.166
and then you'll remind
her about it the next day

46:50.168 --> 46:51.503
and then she won't
even remember it.

46:51.970 --> 46:53.336
I know what
you're talking about.

46:53.338 --> 46:54.240
I've seen that.

46:54.972 --> 46:56.108
She blacks out.

46:57.075 --> 46:58.541
Listen, she's an artist.

46:58.543 --> 47:00.046
She hears voices.

47:00.378 --> 47:01.313
You're a songwriter.

47:01.813 --> 47:02.914
You know what that's like.

47:06.151 --> 47:08.919
That lightning did something
to her, I'm telling you.

47:08.921 --> 47:11.157
Can't have rock and roll
without electricity.

47:12.057 --> 47:14.356
We're all electricity
when you think about it.

47:14.358 --> 47:17.529
Every thought we have,
synapsis...

47:20.831 --> 47:22.133
She needs help.

47:22.934 --> 47:25.137
Listen, those voices in her head

47:25.503 --> 47:27.105
are our ticket to ride.

47:29.474 --> 47:32.945
Bitch better have my money!

47:39.084 --> 47:40.950
Rachel, you all right?

47:40.952 --> 47:42.151
Jesus Christ.

47:51.630 --> 47:53.064
Here you go, daddy.

47:53.432 --> 47:55.966
Cash money.

47:55.968 --> 47:58.001
Yeah, I think the bride's dad

47:58.003 --> 48:00.439
was in the Armenian mafia
or something.

48:01.872 --> 48:04.443
We haven't even talked
about the fact that, um...

48:06.278 --> 48:08.311
a guy died
in the parking lot tonight.

48:08.313 --> 48:10.115
I don't remember any of that.

48:11.349 --> 48:13.952
You don't remember
an ambulance and a dead guy?

48:15.019 --> 48:18.157
He was, like, they said
27, heart attack, right?

48:18.590 --> 48:19.691
Did you say heart attack?

48:20.592 --> 48:21.559
<i>Heart attack?</i>

48:22.260 --> 48:23.428
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

48:24.829 --> 48:26.665
<i>Later we found out the LAPD
didn't know what to call it.</i>

48:27.331 --> 48:30.068
<i>They had no idea what
they were dealing with.</i>

48:30.369 --> 48:31.568
<i>Neither did we.</i>

48:31.570 --> 48:33.669
Well, I heard at
the Animal Benefit

48:33.671 --> 48:36.441
that this guy, well,
he also died of a heart attack.

48:37.342 --> 48:38.711
She's breaking hearts already.

48:42.514 --> 48:44.050
I'm tired.

48:45.316 --> 48:46.519
Yeah.

48:47.019 --> 48:48.688
You should be,
that was a hell of a show.

48:50.555 --> 48:52.258
You just need
to calm down a little.

48:52.957 --> 48:54.693
No, I need to speed up

48:55.126 --> 48:57.595
and catch up on all
the stuff that I missed out on.

48:58.363 --> 48:59.665
No, you need to relax.

49:01.298 --> 49:02.200
Okay.

49:03.968 --> 49:04.669
Help me.

49:14.046 --> 49:14.747
I can't.

49:19.718 --> 49:21.053
I need you to.

49:37.135 --> 49:38.137
Jesus.

49:41.539 --> 49:42.574
Rachel...

49:44.175 --> 49:45.477
What, are you my mother?

49:46.477 --> 49:48.244
Between your judging

49:48.246 --> 49:50.245
and your pushing me
all the time,

49:50.247 --> 49:51.416
it's like she never left.

49:51.615 --> 49:53.151
Don't you think
you've had enough?

49:55.186 --> 49:56.486
Fuck you, Jimmy.

49:56.488 --> 49:58.620
I mean, who are you
to be lecturing anybody

49:58.622 --> 49:59.791
about anything?

50:22.713 --> 50:24.349
I mean, after all, Jimmy,

50:26.251 --> 50:27.653
you're just a one-hit wonder,

50:30.421 --> 50:32.057
a two-time felon,

50:34.325 --> 50:35.561
three-time divorcée,

50:37.729 --> 50:39.564
no talent ex-junkie.

50:41.666 --> 50:43.135
Well, you figured me out.

50:43.735 --> 50:45.100
Now just...

50:45.102 --> 50:46.436
why don't you get
the fuck out of here?

50:46.438 --> 50:48.537
Everybody just calm down
for a second.

50:48.539 --> 50:50.642
And what about that
record deal, Grandpa?

50:52.110 --> 50:53.646
Record deal you pissed away?

50:54.044 --> 50:56.314
The record deal I don't need
any of you for?

50:56.747 --> 50:57.816
Okay, you know what?

51:00.050 --> 51:01.686
You fucking two
deserve each other.

51:02.419 --> 51:03.555
I'm out of here.

51:05.289 --> 51:06.291
Poor baby.

51:13.497 --> 51:14.833
What about you, Jimmy?

51:25.843 --> 51:27.178
You want a taste?

51:31.582 --> 51:33.351
Does this look tempting at all?

51:41.226 --> 51:42.128
Come on.

51:43.294 --> 51:45.363
No thanks, I'm allergic.

51:45.630 --> 51:48.901
Whenever I do it,
I break out in handcuffs.

51:52.269 --> 51:53.803
Come on, suck it.

51:53.805 --> 51:54.907
You know what?

51:56.675 --> 51:57.709
Let's get you home.

51:59.811 --> 52:01.412
You want to take me home?

52:24.836 --> 52:26.238
What's wrong with you?

52:27.805 --> 52:28.706
You know...

52:30.642 --> 52:33.646
we all carry the seeds of
our own destruction, Mr. Klein.

52:40.184 --> 52:42.387
Wow, this is too fun.

52:46.691 --> 52:47.927
<i>So there I am,</i>

52:48.159 --> 52:49.892

52:59.403 --> 53:03.309

was that wasn't Rachel anymore.</i>

53:06.311 --> 53:08.881
<i>Weeks went by,
she disappeared again.</i>

53:09.481 --> 53:12.251
<i>I was dealing with my own
personal freak out,</i>

53:12.550 --> 53:15.651
<i>and the boys were left wondering
what the hell happened?</i>

53:15.653 --> 53:16.885
Fuck, it's been two weeks.

53:16.887 --> 53:18.256
What do we do?

53:18.456 --> 53:19.959
We got to start jamming again.

53:20.959 --> 53:21.927
Yeah, well,

53:22.427 --> 53:24.229
it looks like it's just going
to be you and me.

53:24.461 --> 53:26.698
I don't know.
She won't call me back and...

53:28.666 --> 53:30.435
I guess it's over.

53:33.238 --> 53:35.671
What's over, your new
relationship or the band?

53:35.673 --> 53:37.442
Fuck you, dude, okay, shut up.

53:37.675 --> 53:39.508
Why would we put
this much energy into it

53:39.510 --> 53:40.910
just to watch it crumble?

53:40.912 --> 53:42.278
This makes no fucking sense.

53:42.280 --> 53:43.412
Do we even need her?

53:43.414 --> 53:44.515
Yeah, we need her.

53:45.717 --> 53:47.883
And you have to admit,
man, there's...

53:47.885 --> 53:49.721
What does Jimmy say
we should do?

53:50.322 --> 53:52.390
I don't know, I mean...

53:53.490 --> 53:55.994
It's undeniable,
she's one of a kind, dude.

53:56.227 --> 53:57.296
She's...

53:57.561 --> 53:59.796
She has something
really special that

53:59.798 --> 54:02.564
a lot of people want
that you can't learn.

54:02.566 --> 54:03.599
Yeah.

54:33.764 --> 54:34.963
What are you even doing?

It's, like,
four o'clock in the morning.

54:36.334 --> 54:37.970

I'm sorry.

All right.

a 25-cent piece of plastic.

had nothing to do with this.

What?

59:02.934 --> 59:05.037

and made it better.

59:06.236 --> 59:07.204
All right, very funny.

Fine, if you don't want to
talk about it, it's fine.

59:09.072 --> 59:10.939
No, she just kissed my neck.

<i>Of course, I had no idea.</i>

01:00:42.934 --> 01:00:44.066
<i>But goddamn it,</i>

01:00:44.068 --> 01:00:45.834
<i>every time she took another hit,</i>

01:00:45.836 --> 01:00:47.336
<i>we made another hit.</i>

01:00:47.338 --> 01:00:49.338
<i>It's got to be worth something,
right?</i>

01:01:00.852 --> 01:01:06.224
<i>♪ I feel you
in the autumn breeze ♪</i>

01:01:07.425 --> 01:01:13.198
<i>♪ And I smell you
in the gentle fallen leaves ♪</i>

01:01:14.999 --> 01:01:20.372
<i>♪ And I see you
every single day ♪</i>

01:01:22.173 --> 01:01:28.747
<i>♪ When all I want is
for you to just go away ♪</i>

01:01:29.981 --> 01:01:33.985
<i>♪ Fade away from me ♪</i>

01:01:35.418 --> 01:01:37.218
<i>♪ Mm-hm ♪</i>

01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:41.193
<i>♪ Fade away from me ♪</i>

01:01:42.093 --> 01:01:44.496
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪</i>

01:01:44.729 --> 01:01:49.201
<i>♪ Fade away from me ♪</i>

01:01:49.867 --> 01:01:51.934
<i>♪ Mm, fade away ♪</i>

01:01:51.936 --> 01:01:53.071
<i>Right after that,</i>

01:01:54.305 --> 01:01:55.140
<i>Rick's girlfriend made him
listen to the demo.</i>

01:01:56.206 --> 01:01:58.109
<i>And we got that
record deal after all.</i>

01:01:58.409 --> 01:02:00.441
<i>We were signed,
but we had to get Rick</i>

01:02:00.443 --> 01:02:01.813
<i>to support the record.</i>

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:03.849
<i>I knew what he wanted for that.</i>

01:02:04.247 --> 01:02:06.948
<i>So I threw a party
to set the mood.</i>

01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:08.486
Hi, guys, it's your girl Kami,

01:02:08.718 --> 01:02:11.820
and you are hashtag blessed
for pressing play

01:02:11.822 --> 01:02:14.957
because we are here
at the Hollow Body

01:02:14.959 --> 01:02:19.794
record release party
with bad boy Jimmy Kleen.

01:02:19.796 --> 01:02:21.296
Jimmy, thanks for joining us.

01:02:21.298 --> 01:02:22.398
Yeah, it's my pleasure.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.834
Yes, and you're back!

01:02:24.836 --> 01:02:26.167
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:02:26.169 --> 01:02:27.403
Back from the dead.

01:02:27.405 --> 01:02:28.903
Clean living.

01:02:28.905 --> 01:02:30.508
Stay in school, don't do drugs.

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:34.845
Oh, and there's the lead singer,
Rachel.

01:02:35.046 --> 01:02:36.314
Who's that she's with?

01:02:36.947 --> 01:02:38.379
- Who knows?
- Whoa!

01:02:38.381 --> 01:02:40.351
- She's a wild child.
- Huh.

01:02:41.218 --> 01:02:43.487
Just give me a second,
all right?

01:02:44.354 --> 01:02:46.157
Uh, pardon me.

01:02:47.925 --> 01:02:50.425
Sorry, bud, can you just
back off, all right bud?

01:02:50.427 --> 01:02:51.894
She's grinding on me, asshole.

01:02:51.896 --> 01:02:53.461
All right, calm down,
calm down.

01:02:54.999 --> 01:02:56.265
- Sorry, excuse me.
- Okay, no worries.

01:02:56.267 --> 01:02:57.535
Dude, turn that off.

01:02:57.767 --> 01:02:59.968
- Come on.
- Dude, he hit me!

01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:01.937
Hey, hey,
what the fuck, Jimmy?

01:03:01.939 --> 01:03:03.405
Rick's going to be here
any minute.

01:03:03.407 --> 01:03:05.506
Can you stay sober
for five fucking minutes?

01:03:05.508 --> 01:03:07.344
You had your fun,
I'm having mine.

01:03:07.778 --> 01:03:09.879
Listen, you said
you wanted a record deal.

01:03:09.881 --> 01:03:11.512
Well, here it is,
so don't fucking blow it.

01:03:11.514 --> 01:03:13.381
I said I wanted
to be in a band.

01:03:13.383 --> 01:03:14.552
Well, you are in a band.

01:03:14.785 --> 01:03:16.318
Now it's time to hit
the high notes.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.122
We're not even
performing tonight.

01:03:19.322 --> 01:03:21.559
Well, Rick's not sure
about distribution, all right?

01:03:22.093 --> 01:03:23.392
So if you can just put on

01:03:23.394 --> 01:03:24.930
a little private performance
for him.

01:03:25.229 --> 01:03:26.231
Convince him.

01:03:36.039 --> 01:03:36.974
Let's not mince words.

01:03:38.476 --> 01:03:40.244
I fuck him,
he pushes the record?

01:03:43.447 --> 01:03:44.416
Rock and roll.

01:03:45.249 --> 01:03:46.283
Rock and roll.

01:03:49.352 --> 01:03:51.889
Hey. Hey, what the hell
was that? You all right?

01:03:53.189 --> 01:03:54.092
I'm fine.

01:03:56.026 --> 01:03:57.526
What's gotten into you?

01:04:00.463 --> 01:04:01.932
Isn't this what you wanted?

01:04:02.532 --> 01:04:04.535
I wanted you to be
a better performer.

01:04:05.535 --> 01:04:07.271
I like the old you.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.983
Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you okay?

01:04:19.582 --> 01:04:22.151
Okay, all right,
come on, outside somewhere.

01:04:22.153 --> 01:04:24.289
...parking, get her outside,
sort her out.

01:04:25.256 --> 01:04:26.291
All right.

01:04:26.557 --> 01:04:28.392
Wait for him there.
Don't say anything stupid.

01:04:31.561 --> 01:04:33.963
Oh, hi, you're, um,

01:04:33.965 --> 01:04:35.597
- you're Rick Rollins and I'm...
- Yeah.

01:04:35.599 --> 01:04:37.669
I'm a such
a fan of your label.

01:04:37.901 --> 01:04:40.068
I play drums in Hollow Body.

01:04:40.070 --> 01:04:41.171
- Rick. Hey.
- This is Jimmy.

01:04:41.372 --> 01:04:42.570
- Thank you for coming, bro.
- Good to see you.

01:04:42.572 --> 01:04:44.174
- You met Zach, the drummer.
- I did.

01:04:44.474 --> 01:04:45.375
You okay?

01:04:48.445 --> 01:04:49.346
No.

01:04:53.117 --> 01:04:54.185
You're bad.

01:04:54.452 --> 01:04:56.921
You are.

01:04:58.421 --> 01:04:59.590
Please.

01:05:01.959 --> 01:05:03.227
I'm not dead.

01:05:04.595 --> 01:05:05.664
Aren't you?

01:05:08.064 --> 01:05:10.001
Rachel, this is Rick.

01:05:10.434 --> 01:05:13.604
Hey, I'd shake hands,
but I'll give you this instead.

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.209
Save me from this scene.

01:05:18.943 --> 01:05:19.644
All right.

01:05:28.485 --> 01:05:29.720
Where are they going?

01:05:30.588 --> 01:05:33.191
Don't worry about it,
all right? Settle down.

01:06:09.959 --> 01:06:11.292
<i>I got to be honest with you.</i>

01:06:11.294 --> 01:06:13.195
I know you're
an artist and everything,

01:06:13.197 --> 01:06:15.265
but you're so fucking hot.

01:06:15.465 --> 01:06:18.100
The only thing on my mind is,

01:06:18.102 --> 01:06:19.637
excuse me, fucking.

01:06:20.037 --> 01:06:21.669
You know,
I got a place down in Cabo,

01:06:21.671 --> 01:06:23.372
we should go down there.

01:06:23.374 --> 01:06:24.640
We could do some songwriting,

01:06:24.642 --> 01:06:26.575
we can get to know
each other better.

01:06:26.577 --> 01:06:28.744
I got a plane out at
the Santa Monica airport,

01:06:28.746 --> 01:06:30.548
we can get down there
in about two hours.

01:06:32.148 --> 01:06:33.414
All right, Rick.

01:06:33.416 --> 01:06:36.050
And just in case you
don't make me come,

01:06:36.052 --> 01:06:37.287
let's talk business.

01:06:37.655 --> 01:06:38.555
I'm sorry?

01:06:39.689 --> 01:06:41.626
I want to open
for your biggest act.

01:06:43.093 --> 01:06:44.593
I want a publishing deal,

01:06:44.595 --> 01:06:46.727
I keep 50 percent
of whatever the band makes,

01:06:46.729 --> 01:06:48.733
and I want a million
in marketing.

01:06:50.401 --> 01:06:51.302
To start.

01:06:52.001 --> 01:06:53.637
Wow.

01:06:55.338 --> 01:06:57.439
May I ask you
a personal question?

01:06:57.441 --> 01:06:58.640
Anything.

01:06:58.642 --> 01:06:59.778
How old are you?

01:07:00.211 --> 01:07:02.714
Because you seem
very mature for your age.

01:07:03.414 --> 01:07:05.116
I'm older than I look.

01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:07.718
Well, you got fabulous genes.

01:07:08.418 --> 01:07:10.187
I get them from
my mother's side.

01:07:13.124 --> 01:07:15.293
Why don't we move somewhere
a little bit more...

01:07:17.093 --> 01:07:18.095
private?

01:07:18.561 --> 01:07:19.596
I'd love to.

01:07:45.622 --> 01:07:47.758
Zach,
he loves playing the drums.

01:07:49.559 --> 01:07:51.392
- Where are you going?
- Just move.

01:07:51.394 --> 01:07:52.597
Whoa, whoa, or what?

01:07:53.164 --> 01:07:54.695
What are you gonna
head-butt me too?

01:07:54.697 --> 01:07:57.298
I might just throw
you in the fucking pool.

01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:58.836
- Stop it.
- Oh, you're drunk.

01:07:59.068 --> 01:08:00.568
All right, we'll get you home.

01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:02.336
Yeah, where's home, huh?

01:08:02.338 --> 01:08:04.205
What, the house
that Carrie kicked me out of

01:08:04.207 --> 01:08:05.740
or the apartment I can't afford?

01:08:05.742 --> 01:08:07.209
What's your fucking
wife's problem?

01:08:07.211 --> 01:08:08.376
You didn't even touch her.

01:08:08.378 --> 01:08:10.312
The problem is I wanted to.

01:08:10.314 --> 01:08:12.650
But you decided not to
do anything, all right?

01:08:13.082 --> 01:08:14.349
And that was a choice.

01:08:14.351 --> 01:08:15.320
Yeah.

01:08:15.619 --> 01:08:16.688
So deal with it.

01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:18.522
Is that her choice?

01:08:18.856 --> 01:08:20.524
No one's holding
a gun to her head.

01:08:23.826 --> 01:08:24.795
Hang on a second.

01:08:26.830 --> 01:08:28.666
Something's not right.

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:30.902
You just need to relax.

01:08:31.134 --> 01:08:32.169
Yeah?

01:08:32.469 --> 01:08:33.438
Let it happen.

01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:54.452
It's done.

01:10:01.625 --> 01:10:03.461
Let's go have a cigarette.

01:10:04.961 --> 01:10:06.496
I think I've earned it.

01:10:24.348 --> 01:10:25.917
I can see why she likes you.

01:10:28.318 --> 01:10:29.019
Rachel?

01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:31.923
Rachel.

01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:41.965
Rachel.

Get out!

01:11:32.582 --> 01:11:33.483
Rachel.

01:11:36.853 --> 01:11:38.455
Wake up, wake up.

01:11:38.921 --> 01:11:39.991
Rachel?

01:11:44.762 --> 01:11:45.662
Rachel.

01:11:56.706 --> 01:11:57.607
She's gone.

01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:22.734
Yeah.

01:12:26.702 --> 01:12:27.935
Yeah.

01:13:08.478 --> 01:13:10.947
<i>Rachel.</i>

01:13:14.151 --> 01:13:16.485
<i>Scott didn't know
what hit him.</i>

01:13:16.487 --> 01:13:18.619
<i>When he woke up,
all he remembered was</i>

01:13:18.621 --> 01:13:20.754
<i>that he finally got
what he wanted,</i>

01:13:20.756 --> 01:13:21.992
<i>and regretted it.</i>

01:13:47.049 --> 01:13:49.219
<i>You'd think that killing
the head of your label</i>

01:13:49.452 --> 01:13:51.019
<i>would be a bad thing.</i>

01:13:51.021 --> 01:13:52.753
<i>Out of respect for the family,</i>

01:13:52.755 --> 01:13:54.959
<i>I told Rick's dad
it was a heart attack.</i>

01:13:55.424 --> 01:13:56.925
<i>They've been
going around lately.</i>

01:13:56.927 --> 01:13:58.360
<i>So next thing you know,</i>

01:13:58.362 --> 01:14:00.631
<i>he's talking about
throwing a benefit concert,</i>

01:14:01.531 --> 01:14:03.668
<i>and guess who managed
to get on the line up?</i>

01:14:16.479 --> 01:14:17.581
<i>Please come.</i>

01:14:18.749 --> 01:14:20.050
How can we afford it?

01:14:20.717 --> 01:14:21.919
You're not getting paid.

01:14:24.054 --> 01:14:25.923
Well, it's a benefit.
I mean, nobody's getting paid.

01:14:27.624 --> 01:14:29.994
An infant does not belong
at a rock concert.

01:14:33.729 --> 01:14:34.863
We'll get, like,

01:14:34.865 --> 01:14:36.701
little baby headphones
or something.

01:14:39.670 --> 01:14:40.868
Please, this is, like,

01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:42.806
the biggest show
I've ever played.

01:14:43.874 --> 01:14:45.041
Good for you.

01:14:46.643 --> 01:14:48.145
You got everything you wanted.

01:14:50.179 --> 01:14:51.682
No, not everything.

01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:55.018
I...

01:14:57.653 --> 01:14:58.688
Oh, Carrie.

01:14:59.022 --> 01:15:00.291
- No, I...
- Come on, don't.

01:15:01.657 --> 01:15:02.559
Carrie.

01:15:34.523 --> 01:15:36.893
Richie was a great friend,
a brother, really.

01:15:37.794 --> 01:15:39.162
Struck down in his prime.

01:15:40.129 --> 01:15:42.931
Yeah, well,
that's why we're here, right?

01:15:42.933 --> 01:15:44.766
Make something good
come out of it.

01:15:44.768 --> 01:15:48.305
Can we just, um,
talk about the heart attacks?

01:15:49.171 --> 01:15:51.873
'Cause every gig we do,
someone dies.

01:15:51.875 --> 01:15:53.074
What, are we cursed?

01:15:53.076 --> 01:15:55.813
This is a benefit
for heart disease.

01:15:56.179 --> 01:15:57.715
Have a fucking heart.

01:15:58.115 --> 01:15:59.317
We're just gonna sit here

01:15:59.549 --> 01:16:00.914
and act like
nothing's happening?

01:16:00.916 --> 01:16:02.016
Just stick to the music,

01:16:02.018 --> 01:16:03.219
- please, man!
- Dude!

01:16:03.719 --> 01:16:05.252
People die all the time.

01:16:05.254 --> 01:16:07.657
Okay, well, let's just keep
doing the interview.

01:16:07.857 --> 01:16:10.994
Talk about the first night,
the party.

01:16:13.562 --> 01:16:16.366
Well, technically,
we crashed that party.

01:16:17.233 --> 01:16:19.102
Technically? Definitely.

01:16:21.838 --> 01:16:23.040
Thank God you did.

01:16:26.576 --> 01:16:28.243
I got something for you.

01:16:28.245 --> 01:16:29.276
Yeah?

01:16:29.278 --> 01:16:30.180
Earned it.

01:16:33.316 --> 01:16:35.850
No, dude.

01:16:35.852 --> 01:16:36.754
Yeah.

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.656
- You serious?
- Serious.

01:17:24.634 --> 01:17:25.436
Hi, babies.

01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:26.370
Wow.

01:17:28.205 --> 01:17:29.173
You like?

01:17:32.909 --> 01:17:35.243
You know it's raining out there.
You're gonna be freezing.

01:17:35.245 --> 01:17:36.914
Don't worry about me, baby.

01:17:37.813 --> 01:17:39.182
I'll outlive all of you.

01:17:43.754 --> 01:17:45.156
What are we drinking to?

01:17:48.125 --> 01:17:49.794
Hmm, me.

01:17:55.197 --> 01:17:57.133
How you feeling?

01:18:04.406 --> 01:18:05.308
Never better.

01:18:10.946 --> 01:18:13.217
You'll never guess who's here.

01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:19.322
Surprise.

01:18:19.755 --> 01:18:20.790
Carrie?

01:18:27.964 --> 01:18:29.834
- You're...
- Hey.

01:18:38.842 --> 01:18:39.744
You look great.

01:18:42.112 --> 01:18:43.781
- How's she doing?
- Great.

01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:50.420
- Nice headphones.
- I thought you'd like them.

01:18:51.287 --> 01:18:53.491
- What are you doing here?
- It wasn't me, it was...

01:18:53.723 --> 01:18:54.992
it was Rachel.

01:18:55.192 --> 01:18:58.229
She arranged for us to come
and wanted to surprise you.

01:19:01.197 --> 01:19:03.334
- Thanks.
- Are you all right?

01:19:05.302 --> 01:19:07.972
Yeah, no, I'm much better now.

01:19:08.871 --> 01:19:10.273
Hollow Body, you're next.

01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:12.276
About time.

01:19:13.477 --> 01:19:16.410
Come, let's go freshen up
in my dressing room real quick.

01:19:16.412 --> 01:19:17.881
Rachel, we don't
have time for that.

01:19:18.814 --> 01:19:20.817
Relax, can't start without me.

01:19:30.293 --> 01:19:33.197
We did it, man,
just like I promised you.

01:19:33.863 --> 01:19:35.363
Yeah.

01:19:35.365 --> 01:19:37.367
Come on, man,
I thought you'd be happier.

01:19:38.802 --> 01:19:41.505
You've dreamt about this
since the moment I met you.

01:19:43.106 --> 01:19:46.010
Yeah,
but just not like this, man.

01:19:48.545 --> 01:19:52.312
Yeah, well, it's never
the way you want it to be.

01:19:52.314 --> 01:19:54.148
Dude, you're just...
you're not hearing me though.

01:19:54.150 --> 01:19:56.187
- It's...
- You're right, I'm not.

01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:58.222
Jimmy...

01:20:02.291 --> 01:20:03.893
Wow. This is, uh...

01:20:05.428 --> 01:20:06.964
this is pretty amazing.

01:20:10.567 --> 01:20:12.837
Don't think I've ever...

01:20:13.536 --> 01:20:16.207
been in a room
with this many mirrors before.

01:20:22.278 --> 01:20:23.580
Yeah, it's kind of, um...

01:20:25.247 --> 01:20:27.250
a pre-show ritual.

01:20:34.290 --> 01:20:35.489
You get what you need?

01:20:35.491 --> 01:20:38.161
Oh, yeah.

01:20:39.094 --> 01:20:40.030
All right, boys.

01:20:48.504 --> 01:20:49.405
Where's Carrie?

01:20:50.506 --> 01:20:52.175
She'll be down in a minute.

01:20:54.611 --> 01:20:56.947
Don't worry, she's got
the best seat in the house.

01:21:03.887 --> 01:21:05.956
Could you take a picture
of me before the show?

01:21:06.455 --> 01:21:07.357
Yeah.

01:21:18.268 --> 01:21:19.904
I fucking knew it.

01:21:22.004 --> 01:21:22.906
Oops.

01:21:24.273 --> 01:21:26.110
Yeah, about that...

01:21:27.544 --> 01:21:30.314
You know, Carrie,
you're very sweet.

01:21:33.349 --> 01:21:34.951
But Scott doesn't want sweet.

01:21:36.553 --> 01:21:37.655
He wants me.

01:21:39.656 --> 01:21:41.292
They're waiting for us, Rachel.

01:21:43.125 --> 01:21:44.994
Yeah, but you're not Rachel,
are you?

01:21:45.929 --> 01:21:47.064
Not since the accident.

01:21:48.231 --> 01:21:51.201
Those heart attacks,
that you, too?

01:21:58.974 --> 01:22:00.311
Who do you think you are?

01:22:03.646 --> 01:22:04.682
Look at me.

01:22:08.284 --> 01:22:09.687
You don't know what Scott wants.

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:11.722
You think I'm sweet?

01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:14.692
There's more to me.

01:22:15.224 --> 01:22:16.160
Yeah?

01:22:16.393 --> 01:22:17.461
You don't know me.

01:22:18.027 --> 01:22:21.064
You don't know my family.
You don't know Scott.

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.367
What do you...

01:22:25.268 --> 01:22:26.170
You fucking...

01:22:43.353 --> 01:22:46.690
Mm.

01:22:51.027 --> 01:22:54.497
Oh!

01:22:55.665 --> 01:22:56.700
Oh.

01:23:02.472 --> 01:23:03.639
You're bad.

01:23:05.642 --> 01:23:07.077
It's show time.

01:23:15.050 --> 01:23:16.620
<i>People, it's time, you're on!</i>

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.597
Jimmy, dude, what the hell
are we gonna do?

01:23:27.296 --> 01:23:28.462
We play.

01:23:28.464 --> 01:23:29.365
With that?

01:23:32.735 --> 01:23:35.470
Oh, I've played with worse.
Dude, we're gonna...

01:23:35.472 --> 01:23:38.071
- Jimmy.
- Come on. Let's go!

01:23:44.214 --> 01:23:45.482
This is unbelievable.

01:23:46.648 --> 01:23:47.550
Zach, dude...

01:24:05.768 --> 01:24:10.107
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
from Hollywood, California,</i>

01:24:11.107 --> 01:24:13.143
<i>Hollow Body.</i>

01:24:25.354 --> 01:24:27.390
<i>The strike killed us instantly.</i>

01:24:28.090 --> 01:24:30.427
<i>The fire took another
nine people.</i>

01:24:30.759 --> 01:24:33.597
<i>Injured? I don't know, 50.</i>

01:24:37.534 --> 01:24:38.669
<i>But you know what?</i>

01:24:40.068 --> 01:24:41.437
<i>They never found Rachel.</i>

01:24:42.104 --> 01:24:43.107
<i>Not a trace.</i>

01:24:43.473 --> 01:24:44.374
<i>Vanished.</i>

01:24:46.075 --> 01:24:48.245
<i>Always leave them wanting more.</i>

01:25:11.601 --> 01:25:14.403

is the ultimate career move.</i>

01:25:16.305 --> 01:25:17.307

01:25:20.742 --> 01:25:22.211
