00:21.372 --> 00:22.873
I'm prepping the IV.

00:25.726 --> 00:28.729
We have the CT Scan.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.531
Doctor.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.732
Let's see what we've got here.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.770
You see this right there?

00:53.854 --> 00:55.356
Doctor, she's prepped.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.359
- Here we go.
- Okay.

01:00.361 --> 01:03.364
Can we get Maureen down here
to assist?

01:03.864 --> 01:05.699
- On my count.
- All right.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.735
Lift.

01:10.604 --> 01:13.107
I want two large bore IV's.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.111
Let's get 'em prepped.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.202
Excuse me. Hello?

01:42.536 --> 01:43.721
- Hello!
- Hello?

01:44.221 --> 01:45.890
Hello. Excuse me.

01:46.090 --> 01:46.724
Hello!

01:48.192 --> 01:49.610
Excuse me!

01:50.110 --> 01:52.997
I'm looking for a teenage girl.
She was in an accident.

01:53.197 --> 01:55.950
A teenage girl brought in a few
minutes ago, traffic accident.

01:56.233 --> 01:57.034
I'll be right with you.

01:57.234 --> 01:59.620
We just called,
there was a traffic accident.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.872
Certainly. Do you have our fax number?

02:02.873 --> 02:05.626
- Excuse me.
- Thank you. You're welcome.

02:05.826 --> 02:08.579
Dr. Kinnard, did you get the message
about the heart seminar?

02:08.779 --> 02:10.413
Yes, I did. Thank you.

02:10.830 --> 02:11.882
Car accident.

02:12.383 --> 02:14.868
Sorry. My shift starts at
4:00, I just got here.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.554
Just please help me. Teenage
girl, traffic accident.

02:17.754 --> 02:19.356
The name?

02:19.556 --> 02:21.058
Kimberly Bauer or Janet York.

02:21.425 --> 02:23.143
B-A-U-E-R, Y-O-R-K.

02:28.148 --> 02:28.983
No name listed.

02:29.934 --> 02:31.435
Just a Jane Doe.

02:31.635 --> 02:32.269
Maybe...

02:32.736 --> 02:34.271
Hey! You can't go in there!

02:42.863 --> 02:45.282
Oh, my God, Janet.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.711
I'm sure you're going to find Kim.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.237
- Hello?
- Honey, it's me.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.856
Where have you been?
I've been trying to reach you.

03:09.056 --> 03:09.857
Have you found Kim yet?

03:10.357 --> 03:12.109
No. We're at St. Mark's Hospital.

03:12.309 --> 03:13.194
Hospital?

03:13.394 --> 03:15.396
Kim's friend was in a car accident.

03:15.596 --> 03:16.697
What about Kim?

03:17.064 --> 03:19.216
I don't know. She tried to call me.
She was in a panic.

03:19.416 --> 03:21.568
Sounded like she was in trouble.
I tried to get her.

03:21.768 --> 03:23.370
We were stopped by this cop.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.706
Teri, calm down.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.358
I'm losing my mind. I really need you here.

03:28.558 --> 03:30.511
I know. I'll get there as soon as I can.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.714
You've got to tell me, where was Kim
when she called the second time?

03:34.214 --> 03:35.966
I don't know, she was...

03:37.468 --> 03:38.769
...North Hollywood.

03:38.969 --> 03:43.674
It sounded like she was being chased. And
then when we got there, she was gone.

03:43.874 --> 03:45.809
Kim's friend Janet, let me speak to her.

03:46.310 --> 03:47.144
She's in surgery.

03:47.344 --> 03:50.564
Surgery? Is she gonna make it?

03:50.764 --> 03:51.365
I don't know.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.566
Listen to me, Teri.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.319
What I'm trying to do
right now is to find Kim.

03:55.602 --> 03:58.856
I need you to stay where you are, and
I will get there as soon as I can.

03:59.056 --> 04:00.157
Kim? You've been trying to find her?

04:00.357 --> 04:03.410
I've been out all night
trying to find Kim!

04:03.777 --> 04:07.748
Teri, I'm going to explain it to you later.
Okay? You're gonna have to trust me.

04:08.749 --> 04:09.750
Teri.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.586
Honey, I love you.

04:12.786 --> 04:16.290
I promise you, we're going to
get through this. Okay?

04:17.291 --> 04:19.093
I love you too, Jack.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.928
I'll get back to you
as soon as I know anything.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.647
She's here. They say the
other one's dead.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.649
Don't worry, I will.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.787
Ok, we're done.
There's been a change of plan.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.906
Drive to the compound,
you'll get your money there.

04:49.406 --> 04:49.907
No problem.

04:50.407 --> 04:51.208
Go by a different route.

04:51.408 --> 04:53.410
I don't want us to look like a caravan.

04:53.610 --> 04:54.411
Right. Okay.

04:56.413 --> 04:58.415
- Let's just split.
- Are you crazy?

04:58.615 --> 05:00.718
We got $20,000 coming.

05:00.918 --> 05:02.419
I don't like it.
This guy's psycho.

05:02.619 --> 05:03.921
You're forgetting something.

05:04.421 --> 05:07.307
All right. Last month,
Phoenix? You owe me.

05:07.507 --> 05:10.394
So let's get the money,
then split. All right?

05:27.911 --> 05:31.115
This is fine, Patty. We'll finish
it after the breakfast.

05:32.616 --> 05:34.701
Still got a couple hours
to grab some sleep.

05:34.901 --> 05:36.003
Only if you do.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.223
I made mochas.

05:39.423 --> 05:41.425
Hey, I thought you were down.

05:42.426 --> 05:43.427
I'm up.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.229
I couldn't sleep.

05:45.429 --> 05:50.517
The polls open in less than three
hours, Mr. President-to-be.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.020
Heavy on the caffeine for me. Patty?

05:53.220 --> 05:54.304
Nothing for me.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.607
- Mom?
- No.

05:58.609 --> 05:59.860
You look exhausted.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.062
Go to bed, that's an order.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.565
All right.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.817
You'll wake me if you need anything?

06:07.017 --> 06:07.985
Absolutely.

06:08.185 --> 06:08.986
Okay.

06:12.990 --> 06:14.825
- Night.
- Goodnight.

06:20.881 --> 06:21.882
David...

06:24.001 --> 06:26.887
You're not gonna say anything to
Nicole about Keith, are you?

06:27.087 --> 06:29.973
We don't even know for sure whether
Kingsley's gonna go...

06:30.173 --> 06:31.933
...forward with the story.

06:32.133 --> 06:33.694
- We have to, Sherry.
- Why?

06:33.894 --> 06:36.113
Because the press is going
to get a hold of this.

06:36.313 --> 06:39.683
Whether it's today, tomorrow, next
week, Nicole should be prepared.

06:40.184 --> 06:42.519
I thought you said that Carl
was going to take care of it.

06:43.020 --> 06:43.821
He's gonna do what he can.

06:44.021 --> 06:46.773
I don't want her to suddenly
hear something on the news.

06:46.973 --> 06:48.275
She'd be devastated.

06:48.775 --> 06:52.779
She's so happy right now, David. We've
got to take it one step at a time.

06:52.979 --> 06:54.281
Dad, it's ready.

07:06.927 --> 07:10.380
Daddy, I figured all it out, and even
if we lose Orange County...

07:10.580 --> 07:12.399
...we're still going to win.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.635
Assuming we take Ventura
by a 10 percent margin.

07:14.835 --> 07:15.936
No, even seven.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.239
It's all right there, in last night's poll.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.392
You make it look like there's
nothing to worry about.

07:22.893 --> 07:25.729
That's because there is
nothing to worry about.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.451
- Hey...
- Nicole.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.619
- No, go ahead.
- No, you first.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.406
I talked to Suzy and Rachel Brenner
this afternoon and they're flying out.

07:36.606 --> 07:38.542
I invited them to the victory party.

07:38.742 --> 07:40.544
My lord. I haven't seen them...

07:40.794 --> 07:41.962
...since you all were in high school.

07:42.162 --> 07:45.165
You're going to see them
tomorrow. Actually, tonight.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.467
God, that's great.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.552
What were you gonna say?

07:49.553 --> 07:50.053
Nothing.

07:51.838 --> 07:53.524
CTU, this is Myers.

07:53.724 --> 07:55.225
Mason looking over your shoulder?

07:55.425 --> 07:57.027
No.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.680
He ended the lockdown as soon as
soon as he found out where you were.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.515
Jack, be careful.
He'll come after you.

08:01.715 --> 08:02.282
I'm at the precinct.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.284
They've got a ring around the suspect.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.487
I'm gonna need help getting to him.
Get hold of Ryan Sealey.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.740
Tell him it's about Palmer,
and I need an override.

08:09.940 --> 08:11.241
Okay, I'll take care of it.

08:19.866 --> 08:21.368
Damn it.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.595
Tony, I'm still off the Net.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.847
I need a contact number for
Ryan Sealey at District Two.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.823
You still pissed off about the lockdown?

08:43.023 --> 08:46.526
Jack's never gonna trust you again.
I'm not sure I will, either.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.029
You don't trust me, but you'll trust Jack?

08:49.946 --> 08:51.248
Come on, Nina.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.576
He's been lying. He's been
hiding things from us.

08:54.776 --> 08:57.904
It maybe okay for you,
but it's not okay for me.

08:58.104 --> 08:59.906
Do you have the number?

09:07.998 --> 09:09.499
Thank you.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.558
I'm sorry, Mr. Bauer,
but this guy killed a cop.

09:18.758 --> 09:20.360
I'm not interfering with booking protocol.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.564
I told you, you'd get a call from
Sealey, our liaison to the PD's office.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.901
Until then, you can have my badge and gun.
I will not interfere.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.436
But I need to see that man now.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.288
What can I tell you?

09:31.488 --> 09:33.323
Fine. Where's your lieutenant?

09:33.523 --> 09:35.159
He checked out, at midnight.

09:35.359 --> 09:37.828
But if he was here, he'd tell
you the same thing.

09:38.528 --> 09:40.130
Sergeant.

09:40.330 --> 09:43.083
The cop that was killed tonight,
Officer Hampton.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.368
Did you know her?

09:47.371 --> 09:48.255
Yeah, I knew her.

09:48.455 --> 09:52.092
I'm investigating a federal case.
She was helping me.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.261
Do you want her death to be in vain?

09:54.461 --> 09:56.730
Please forget about the damn
chain of command.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.801
I need to see this man now, just
for a few minutes, please.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.534
Where's the suspect?

10:18.535 --> 10:20.036
Move him to room two.

10:24.541 --> 10:27.210
- Thank you.
- Follow me.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.805
Hold it, Sergeant. This
man's under my authority.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.718
We shouldn't have let him take her!

11:07.918 --> 11:09.937
There's two of us, one of him,
and we got a gun!

11:10.137 --> 11:13.056
Believe me, dude, you don't wanna pull
a piece on Mr. Gaines.

11:13.256 --> 11:14.524
No? Just on girls?

11:14.724 --> 11:18.011
If you had the hots for her, then you
should've done something.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.065
I just don't want her to get hurt.

11:22.566 --> 11:23.367
Get real, dude.

11:23.567 --> 11:26.153
She saw our faces, she saw his face.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.939
She's not walking. She never was.

11:29.940 --> 11:31.408
You think he's gonna to kill her?

11:31.608 --> 11:32.776
Maybe he already has.

11:35.278 --> 11:36.163
Rick.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.966
Dude. Come on, it's $10,000 a piece.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.701
All right, we just want to get paid
and get gone.

11:41.901 --> 11:44.921
Forget Kimberly, man, she's history.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.935
Listen, Jack...

11:59.135 --> 12:01.137
Until you tell me what you were doing at
Dunlop Plaza with Richard Walsh...

12:01.638 --> 12:02.939
...I'm treating you as a prime suspect.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.358
Why would I kill the only ally
that I've got here?

12:05.859 --> 12:06.610
You tell me.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.312
Why'd you blow the whistle on your
own agents last year?

12:09.512 --> 12:10.447
Why'd you try to blackmail me?

12:10.947 --> 12:13.200
Because you were withholding information
vital to the investigation, George.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.836
I was following orders.

12:16.036 --> 12:19.039
I realize that's a concept you
may be unfamiliar with, Jack...

12:19.239 --> 12:22.242
...but something that some of us
actually do take seriously.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.545
On the other side of this
wall is a suspect...

12:25.745 --> 12:29.216
...who's connected with the people
that want Palmer dead.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.183
How do you know that?

12:30.383 --> 12:31.685
Walsh and Baylor were killed...

12:31.885 --> 12:34.346
...because they obtained information
that led me to this guy.

12:34.546 --> 12:37.007
And if you interfere now, and
something happens to Palmer...

12:37.507 --> 12:38.809
...you'll be seen as impeding
this investigation

12:39.009 --> 12:42.262
...because you have a grudge against me.
So why don't we cut the crap?

12:44.347 --> 12:46.349
How do you want to play this?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.409
I'll talk to him myself.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.194
Look, you're lucky I haven't already
put you in cuffs.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.497
Just sit down, read a magazine.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.524
- Gaines.
- Have you heard from him?

13:10.724 --> 13:12.626
No, I'm gonna call him in 15 minutes.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.628
He should be done by then.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.433
I've got the girl, I'm on the way
to the compound right now.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.552
Gotta go.

13:24.554 --> 13:25.972
Stop, please.

13:55.218 --> 13:58.656
Listen, I don't have time
for this. You understand?

14:19.943 --> 14:21.444
Maureen, it's David Palmer.

14:21.644 --> 14:22.245
Senator?

14:22.445 --> 14:23.246
I'm sorry to wake you.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.749
No, no. that's okay. What's up?

14:25.949 --> 14:27.951
The matter you called about earlier.

14:28.151 --> 14:28.952
Hm-mm.

14:29.452 --> 14:30.503
We need to talk about it.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.505
Okay, let's talk.

14:33.006 --> 14:37.510
Since we're just a few floors apart,
I was thinking maybe we could get together.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.512
Okay, how about I meet you in the lobby?

14:39.712 --> 14:41.514
No, the lobby's too public.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.017
There's a conference room
on the third floor.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.318
I'll have it opened.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.520
I just need about ten minutes
to get dressed.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.771
How does that sound?

14:48.971 --> 14:50.023
Yeah, that's good.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.524
I'll see you in ten.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.526
- Thanks, Maureen.
- Sure.

14:59.616 --> 15:02.118
Those are the only places you
know your daughters were?

15:02.318 --> 15:03.420
Yes.

15:03.620 --> 15:07.624
What about this boy, Dan, who works at
the furniture store?

15:08.124 --> 15:09.125
We don't know anything about him.

15:09.626 --> 15:11.461
But the owner of the store
is Mr. Nowrasteh.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.463
I have his number in here.

15:14.964 --> 15:16.299
Here you are.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.635
Excuse me.

15:23.139 --> 15:23.640
Hello?

15:24.090 --> 15:25.392
Hey, it's me.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.776
Is Janet out of surgery yet?

15:26.976 --> 15:29.312
Yeah. The police showed up.
We're talking to him now.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.731
- Anything new?
- No. How about you?

15:32.232 --> 15:34.034
I'm at the Van Nuys police station.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.736
I think there's someone who knows
where the girls were tonight.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.071
You mean one of the police officers?

15:38.405 --> 15:39.206
No.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.491
Someone they picked up in North Hollywood.

15:41.691 --> 15:42.492
I think he saw Kim.

15:42.992 --> 15:45.161
- Who?
- I don't know, a man.

15:45.361 --> 15:45.962
What did he say?

15:46.162 --> 15:47.664
I'm waiting to talk to him.

15:47.914 --> 15:51.201
Look, you've got to talk to Janet as
soon as she's out of surgery, okay?

15:51.401 --> 15:53.553
I know.

15:53.753 --> 15:56.089
I'll call you as soon as I can.
I've got to go, bye.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.931
So, what did he say?

16:05.131 --> 16:07.967
He says he won't talk to anybody
except you.

16:11.721 --> 16:12.856
So, can I go in?

16:14.357 --> 16:15.642
Yeah.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.061
Thank you.

16:33.576 --> 16:36.246
My colleague said you only wanted
to speak to me.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.049
Well, here I am.

16:39.249 --> 16:43.720
Guess what? Right now, you're speaking
to everyone.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.355
What the hell is he doing?

16:45.555 --> 16:47.757
I thought we were going to talk alone.

16:47.957 --> 16:49.559
You killed a cop.

16:49.759 --> 16:53.263
What you need to do right now is start
telling me the truth.

16:53.463 --> 16:56.182
It was self-defense.
You guys were chasing me.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.518
What's he saying?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.072
Go to hell!

17:02.272 --> 17:04.824
I'm done talking. Get this guy
out of my face!

17:12.781 --> 17:14.183
You get nothing!

17:14.383 --> 17:16.152
I want my lawyer.

17:16.352 --> 17:17.921
Okay, come on!

17:18.121 --> 17:21.374
I want my phone call.
I want my lawyer.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.259
I want my phone call, now!

17:23.760 --> 17:25.428
Jack. Great job.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.097
He knows something.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.299
What are you gonna do,
beat it out of him?

17:29.499 --> 17:31.101
What's the plan, Jack?

17:31.301 --> 17:34.304
What's the plan? Take a walk.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.731
Yo, man, what's up?

18:16.679 --> 18:17.447
Bauer.

18:17.647 --> 18:18.948
Is this line safe?

18:19.148 --> 18:20.258
Tell me about my daughter.

18:20.458 --> 18:21.568
Not until you get me out.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.069
You know where she is?

18:23.269 --> 18:23.937
Heard some guys.

18:24.404 --> 18:25.905
Guys I work with.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.407
What guys?

18:27.607 --> 18:30.610
They have your daughter, and they're
gonna call me in 20 minutes.

18:30.810 --> 18:31.411
Where?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.112
Back where you first saw me.

18:33.312 --> 18:34.697
San Fernando Road?

18:35.198 --> 18:37.200
If I don't answer, they'll know
something's wrong.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.701
Get me out of here.

18:38.901 --> 18:40.003
Don't know if I can.

18:40.203 --> 18:42.205
I'm the one chance you got to find
your daughter.

18:42.705 --> 18:45.425
I'm not there for that call, the
chance is over.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.927
Better think of something fast.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.542
CTU, this is Myers.

19:03.742 --> 19:04.944
Hey, it's Jack.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.646
Suspect's name is Penticoff.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.148
He's expecting a call in the next
20 minutes...

19:09.348 --> 19:11.951
...at 18166 San Fernando Road.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.238
I need you to trace all available
public lines.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.626
Okay, I see water lines, utilities,
no phone lines.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.713
Keep looking. It's where
he said he'd get the call.

19:24.213 --> 19:27.333
Wait, there's a pay phone
halfway down the block.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.053
- And it's in service.
- Set up a trace.

19:30.253 --> 19:33.139
Not enough time for a warrant.
Forget about the warrant!

19:33.640 --> 19:37.677
Problem. If they're expecting Penticoff,
they'll hang up when they hear your voice.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.896
They're not gonna hear me,
they'll hear Penticoff.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.315
- Did Mason get him out?
- No.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.817
So what are you planning, a jailbreak?

19:45.234 --> 19:46.235
Jack?

19:49.272 --> 19:50.773
Set up the trace.

20:15.748 --> 20:20.119
Bauer's behavior is far from
representative of this agency.

20:20.319 --> 20:23.623
Whether you like it not, we have
to be involved.

20:29.262 --> 20:32.265
Hey, are you the officer that
interviewed Penticoff?

20:32.465 --> 20:34.267
No, I just transferred him
to a holding cell.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.069
I still need to see him.

20:36.269 --> 20:39.355
- You Bauer from CTU?
- Yeah, that's right.

20:39.555 --> 20:44.310
Look, the cop he killed, she was my
partner, understand?

20:46.979 --> 20:47.480
Sorry.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.749
I heard you went off on him before.

20:49.949 --> 20:53.369
I want him to go down for it, which
means a clean bust.

20:53.569 --> 20:55.371
No more extracurricular activities.

20:55.571 --> 20:56.372
Understood.

20:58.374 --> 21:01.127
All right. But I've got
the access card.

21:02.578 --> 21:07.083
Now, you go in with me,
or you don't go in.

21:07.283 --> 21:08.584
I'm fine with that.

21:25.685 --> 21:26.953
Keep him away from me.

21:27.153 --> 21:29.280
He wants to ask a few questions.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.607
No more questions without my lawyer.

21:32.108 --> 21:34.277
Who are you working for?

21:34.477 --> 21:35.578
Are you deaf?

21:35.778 --> 21:38.448
I said, no questions without my lawyer.

21:39.949 --> 21:42.043
- Your lawyer can kiss my ass.
- Yeah?

21:42.243 --> 21:44.337
- Who do you work for?
- Hey, back off!

21:44.704 --> 21:45.505
Get your hands off me.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.673
I told you, he killed my partner.

21:47.873 --> 21:49.675
I know, I was there. Where were you?

21:49.875 --> 21:50.894
What?

21:51.094 --> 21:54.297
Where were you when your partner
really needed you?

22:00.019 --> 22:01.437
Hey!

22:01.938 --> 22:04.023
Get him out of here.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.235
What's the matter with you?

22:07.435 --> 22:09.145
He's crazy, I'm filing charges!

22:15.451 --> 22:18.454
You ought to get yourself under
control, Bauer.

22:20.957 --> 22:22.291
I'll take care of it.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.781
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.583
I wasn't asleep.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.785
Thought you might like some coffee.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.253
Thank you.

23:18.514 --> 23:19.715
She'll turn up.

23:21.217 --> 23:22.935
How's Janet?

23:26.305 --> 23:30.193
They're relieving some pressure
on her spine.

23:30.393 --> 23:31.494
But she's gonna be okay.

23:31.694 --> 23:33.779
At least, that's what they say.

23:33.979 --> 23:35.698
Of course she will.

23:38.701 --> 23:41.287
- Any news from Jack?
- No.

23:41.487 --> 23:43.990
As far as I know, he's still out
looking for Kim.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.292
Well, that's good.

23:46.492 --> 23:49.378
You said he has resources
the police don't have, right?

23:56.552 --> 23:57.553
Even so...

24:00.056 --> 24:02.308
...I imagine you wish he were here.

24:12.401 --> 24:13.653
Arms out, please.

24:20.526 --> 24:22.328
Turn around.

24:22.528 --> 24:24.831
Enough, Maureen's an old friend.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.033
It's all right, he's just doing his job.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.535
- Thank you.
- Your ID, ma'am.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.538
Would you excuse us?

24:37.043 --> 24:39.962
How long have we known
each other, Maureen?

24:40.162 --> 24:42.765
Come on, Senator, that's not fair.

24:42.965 --> 24:47.386
No, I'm just saying, you,
me, my family...

24:47.887 --> 24:49.689
...we've made a journey
together...

24:49.889 --> 24:52.608
...from local politics
to where we are now.

24:52.808 --> 24:57.146
We helped each other along, because
we cared about the same things.

24:57.346 --> 24:58.498
I know that.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.199
Have I ever lied to you?

25:00.399 --> 25:01.200
No.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.486
Embarrassed you?

25:03.686 --> 25:04.587
No.

25:04.787 --> 25:06.205
Then why are you doing this?

25:07.206 --> 25:08.007
Senator.

25:08.207 --> 25:11.711
I wish to God that I didn't
get this information.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.212
But we're talking about murder.

25:13.412 --> 25:14.830
A rumor...

25:15.831 --> 25:18.267
...started by my enemies...

25:18.467 --> 25:21.537
...of whom, as you well know,
I have many.

25:21.737 --> 25:24.807
That's what I thought, too, at first.
But...

25:26.392 --> 25:27.893
Please, go on.

25:29.011 --> 25:31.030
You know I can't tell you my sources.

25:31.230 --> 25:35.118
Come on, Maureen, we're not in court here.

25:35.318 --> 25:39.689
I'm just an old friend with a career
and family that you just may destroy.

25:41.190 --> 25:42.942
You owe me that much at least.

25:45.444 --> 25:46.445
Okay.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.449
Two sources.

25:52.368 --> 25:55.371
One, a man named George Ferragamo.

25:56.872 --> 26:00.292
He was your son's therapist
for four years.

26:00.793 --> 26:02.795
He came to me with the story.

26:04.296 --> 26:06.182
The second source?

26:08.684 --> 26:12.588
The boy who raped your daughter, then
threw himself off the balcony?

26:12.788 --> 26:16.692
Lyle Gibson? His autopsy showed that
he had cuts and scratches...

26:16.892 --> 26:19.645
...that pointed to a violent struggle.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.616
Nicole tried to fight him off.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.285
Yes. That was the explanation.

26:26.786 --> 26:30.489
But an hour later, an African-American
teenager went to this emergency room...

26:30.689 --> 26:31.791
...one block away...

26:31.991 --> 26:33.993
...with similar injuries.

26:34.493 --> 26:36.679
Name here says "Edward Johnson."

26:36.879 --> 26:40.883
The handwriting, where he filled out
the form and signed his name...

26:43.386 --> 26:45.721
...I had it analyzed by an expert.

26:47.556 --> 26:48.974
It's your son's.

27:03.189 --> 27:05.191
I don't give a damn about your expert.

27:05.391 --> 27:07.318
My son never killed anybody.

27:07.518 --> 27:09.445
Senator, I would never...

27:09.945 --> 27:12.415
You do what you have to do, Maureen.

27:12.615 --> 27:15.618
Just be prepared to accept the consequences.

28:19.648 --> 28:20.533
Dad.

28:23.536 --> 28:26.422
Is something wrong?

28:26.622 --> 28:28.624
I guess you'll have to tell me.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.553
The night your sister was raped...

28:41.053 --> 28:44.056
...did you have any contact with
the boy who raped her?

28:45.057 --> 28:46.592
- What?
- You heard me.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.531
I don't believe this. I mean...

28:52.731 --> 28:55.034
What brought this up all of a sudden?

28:55.234 --> 28:59.238
I mean, let's leave all that
in the past where it belongs.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.240
I'd like to, believe me.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.244
But as it happens, I can't.

29:11.033 --> 29:12.835
What did you do that night...

29:13.035 --> 29:16.255
...after you found out that Nicole had
been attacked?

29:16.455 --> 29:18.257
The truth, now. All of it.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.379
I don't think you have
the right to ask me that.

29:29.385 --> 29:30.886
You don't think I have the right?

29:31.387 --> 29:32.271
No, I don't.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.574
See, this thing happened.

29:35.774 --> 29:39.778
Somebody had to deal with it, but you
were in Chicago, giving a speech or...

29:39.978 --> 29:41.080
...New York, receiving an civic award...

29:41.280 --> 29:43.616
We'll deal with my shortcomings
as a father some other time.

29:43.816 --> 29:46.819
Right now, I wanna know what you did
after you found that out your sister...

29:47.019 --> 29:48.988
- ..had been raped.
- And I told you...

29:49.188 --> 29:50.039
...I'm not gonna answer.

29:50.239 --> 29:51.490
You will answer me!

30:17.433 --> 30:19.235
I apologize about Bauer...

30:19.435 --> 30:23.439
...but I'd really appreciate it if we
could handle this internally.

30:23.639 --> 30:25.741
I got no problem with that.

30:25.941 --> 30:29.945
Sergeant, excuse me, but if our federal
colleagues are through with Penticoff...

30:30.145 --> 30:32.948
...I'd like to start processing
him into the system.

30:33.148 --> 30:34.250
What're you doing? Thought you left.

30:34.450 --> 30:38.587
I'm not leaving until Penticoff is
behind bars without bail.

30:38.787 --> 30:41.006
The computer has you checked out five
minutes ago.

30:41.206 --> 30:43.509
All right, guys, we're on the move.

30:44.009 --> 30:45.260
Damn it!

30:49.598 --> 30:52.601
I got this notice in the mail
this afternoon.

30:52.801 --> 30:55.971
Actually, it was yesterday afternoon.

30:56.171 --> 30:57.973
Kimberly was failing Algebra.

30:59.475 --> 31:00.493
It was the second notice.

31:00.693 --> 31:03.696
She intercepted the first one...

31:03.896 --> 31:05.998
...and threw it away.

31:06.198 --> 31:09.201
When she got home, I was so mad at her.

31:14.957 --> 31:16.759
I guess I accused her...

31:16.959 --> 31:21.263
...and I said things to her I
shouldn't have said.

31:21.463 --> 31:25.968
There isn't a parent in the world
who hasn't been there.

31:26.168 --> 31:29.972
Last night, when I told her
good night...

31:30.172 --> 31:32.141
...she didn't even acknowledge me.

31:33.142 --> 31:36.145
I actually had the thought
that I'd be...

31:36.645 --> 31:39.515
I'd be so glad when she got out
of the house.

31:44.520 --> 31:48.741
When Janet wakes up, she'll know where
Kim is, and we'll find her.

31:48.941 --> 31:49.742
I hope it's gonna be that easy.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.043
It will be.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.545
Why wasn't she with Janet?

31:52.745 --> 31:54.538
- It doesn't make sense.
- I don't know.

31:54.738 --> 31:56.532
Maybe she got freaked by the accident...

31:56.732 --> 31:58.834
We should have waited.

31:59.034 --> 31:59.552
No.

31:59.752 --> 32:01.754
We were right to come here.

32:02.254 --> 32:05.257
All we had to go on was the ambulance.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.342
We had to follow up on it.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.601
Listen, whatever happens...

32:16.602 --> 32:19.605
...I'm gonna stay with you
until we find Kim.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.275
You have my promise.

32:25.778 --> 32:26.779
Thank you.

32:29.698 --> 32:31.700
Come on, Davis, we need that uplink.

32:34.203 --> 32:38.007
He says we ought to have a picture by now.

32:38.207 --> 32:42.962
W7 satellite was in the southwest sector
when Bauer helped Penticoff escape.

32:43.162 --> 32:48.000
With luck, we'll be able to pull up visuals
that'll help us pinpoint his location.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.302
That's it, here we go.

32:50.502 --> 32:53.722
Davis, the link's up.
Now I gotta get a back trace.

32:53.922 --> 32:57.142
This is the roof of the building
from 200 miles up.

32:57.593 --> 33:00.095
About how long would you say
since they got out?

33:00.295 --> 33:01.280
I don't know.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.781
Seven, eight minutes?

33:02.981 --> 33:05.784
Okay, Davis, I want to go back ten minutes..

33:05.984 --> 33:08.487
...and give me stills at thirty
second intervals.

33:08.687 --> 33:11.190
Look for two men exiting the
building together.

33:12.241 --> 33:14.359
As of ten minutes ago...

33:14.559 --> 33:15.694
...thirty...

33:15.894 --> 33:17.029
There they are.

33:18.530 --> 33:19.931
Okay, you can speed it up.

33:20.131 --> 33:21.533
All right, speeding up.

33:23.035 --> 33:24.536
Slow it down now.

33:24.736 --> 33:25.337
You got it.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.539
You got a mark on that car?

33:31.460 --> 33:32.261
All right.

33:33.762 --> 33:35.964
Where are you headed, Jack?

34:06.411 --> 34:07.938
- You all set?
- All set.

34:08.138 --> 34:09.665
How much time do you need?

34:09.864 --> 34:12.101
Just a few seconds.

34:12.301 --> 34:14.386
- Who are these guys?
- I told you, I don't know.

34:14.887 --> 34:18.473
They tell me what to do, I do it,
they pay me. That's it.

34:19.842 --> 34:21.393
It's ringing.

34:21.592 --> 34:23.562
- Yeah.
- I'm not showing anything.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.063
- Yeah.
- It's a cell phone.

34:26.264 --> 34:27.366
We're screwed.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.801
I don't have the frequency.

34:30.001 --> 34:32.036
I'll get back to you.
Jack?

34:32.237 --> 34:34.739
It's Gaines, there's been
a change of plans,

34:34.940 --> 34:36.533
but nothing you can't handle.

34:36.733 --> 34:38.304
Taped to the back of the phone

34:38.505 --> 34:40.078
is a set of keys with a remote.

34:42.197 --> 34:43.581
Got 'em.

34:43.782 --> 34:47.335
It's for a parked car on Avenue 26,
Nevada plates 782MOF.

34:47.534 --> 34:51.089
Find it with the remote.
There's a body in the trunk.

34:51.590 --> 34:52.791
Get rid of it.

34:53.292 --> 34:54.793
What did he mean, a body?

34:54.993 --> 34:55.761
I don't know!

34:55.960 --> 34:58.297
- Whose body is in the trunk?
- I don't know.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.115
Walk in front of me.

35:18.617 --> 35:19.952
Come on.

35:34.416 --> 35:38.921
Kneel up against that wall, interlocking
fingers behind your head now.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.056
Don't move.

35:46.895 --> 35:48.230
My God.

36:09.167 --> 36:09.968
Hey, Jack.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.454
- We had a deal.
- Shut up.

36:14.289 --> 36:15.707
Put him in the car.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.679
That's pretty quick work, George.

36:20.879 --> 36:22.180
Tracking me on a satellite?

36:22.380 --> 36:23.682
I'm taking you in, Jack.

36:24.182 --> 36:28.136
He had evidence on the Palmer hit.
That's why I broke him out.

36:33.558 --> 36:34.734
So, who was this?

36:34.934 --> 36:36.111
I don't know yet.

36:40.565 --> 36:44.253
You're having quite a night here,
aren't you, Jack?

36:44.453 --> 36:47.456
Now, why don't you tell me what the hell
is going on here?

36:47.656 --> 36:49.875
Unless you want me to throw you
back to the cops.

36:50.075 --> 36:51.376
They're ready for you.

36:54.379 --> 36:58.750
There are people within the Agency
that are supporting the Palmer hit.

36:58.950 --> 37:01.920
That's why Walsh and Baylor were killed.
They found out about it.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.423
The truth is,
I thought you were a part of it.

37:04.623 --> 37:06.809
I apologize if I was wrong.

37:07.009 --> 37:10.813
George, as crazy as this sounds, you're
gonna have to trust me.

37:11.013 --> 37:15.267
This is gonna look very bad for us if
something happens to Palmer tonight.

37:22.607 --> 37:23.709
So what's next?

37:23.909 --> 37:28.113
I need to take the body down to CTU
and try to make an ID.

37:28.313 --> 37:31.116
I'll go grill Penticoff,
get what I can out of him.

37:33.118 --> 37:34.619
We never had this conversation, all right?

37:34.819 --> 37:35.420
Right.

37:35.620 --> 37:36.922
I'll be at District.

37:37.122 --> 37:41.126
Okay, call the precinct, tell them
we've recovered Penticoff.

37:58.026 --> 37:58.944
What have we got?

37:59.144 --> 38:01.029
Body. Male. Badly mutilated.

38:01.229 --> 38:04.232
I need a positive ID as soon as possible.
Who's our best forensic?

38:04.432 --> 38:05.283
Tanaka.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.285
Bring him in. I'll be there
in 10 minutes.

38:07.485 --> 38:08.904
- I'm on it.
- Okay.

38:17.329 --> 38:19.414
I need a clamp, please.

38:22.084 --> 38:23.251
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

38:23.752 --> 38:25.253
Jack, did you find out anything?

38:25.453 --> 38:26.755
Maybe, I'm not sure yet.

38:27.255 --> 38:28.557
What have you been doing?

38:28.757 --> 38:30.976
I'll be there in 20 minutes.
I'll explain to you then.

38:31.176 --> 38:32.978
- All right.
- Is Janet out of surgery?

38:33.478 --> 38:35.480
Not yet. She should be soon.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.317
Good. It's really important
that I talk to her.

38:38.517 --> 38:42.737
I know it sounds crass sweetheart, but
she's our only link to Kimberly.

38:42.937 --> 38:46.408
Hang in there, honey. I love you.
I'm on my way, okay?

38:46.608 --> 38:47.409
Okay.

39:13.935 --> 39:15.020
Just be cool.

39:30.986 --> 39:34.539
We'd like our money now, if that's,
like, you know, okay.

39:37.075 --> 39:42.547
Just so we're, like, you know, clear,
what happened to the other girl?

39:42.747 --> 39:45.550
Janet? Like I told you,
we had to kill her.

39:47.002 --> 39:49.504
My people tell me, that someone that
fits her description...

39:49.704 --> 39:52.188
...was taken to a hospital
near to where you were.

39:54.009 --> 39:55.927
How do you explain that?

39:58.396 --> 40:00.398
Well, the thing is...

40:03.485 --> 40:06.488
Maybe she wasn't quite dead.

40:08.657 --> 40:09.458
I'll tell you, Dan...

40:09.658 --> 40:12.160
...you're either dead or you're not dead.

40:12.661 --> 40:15.580
There's no such thing as "sort of dead."

40:15.780 --> 40:17.365
Here, let me show you.

40:17.565 --> 40:18.833
No!

40:26.208 --> 40:28.260
You've just been promoted.

40:30.795 --> 40:32.297
Congratulations.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.458
We're losing her.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.215
What's going on?
