12:41.552 --> 12:44.954
It's coming from all around
us, from all directions.

12:44.956 --> 12:47.256
That third mine has its own engine.

12:47.258 --> 12:48.924
The sounds are getting closer.

12:48.926 --> 12:52.061
Mines are coming right at us.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.299
So Nathan James is trapped in
this minefield as we speak!

12:57.301 --> 12:58.601
Michener: That's right.

12:58.603 --> 13:00.269
And when did Chandler leave Hong Kong?

13:00.271 --> 13:01.670
After the kidnapping occurred.

13:01.672 --> 13:03.839
Beatty: At which point
Peng, the president of China,

13:03.841 --> 13:05.512
tried to blow up his plane?

13:05.673 --> 13:07.843
Captain Chandler's
certain that's the case, sir.

13:07.845 --> 13:09.278
And now he's taken the helm

13:09.280 --> 13:11.113
and is personally
leading the rescue mission.

13:11.115 --> 13:12.748
Not quite how you presented it to us.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.083
Well, I'm sure you can understand

13:14.085 --> 13:15.751
I didn't feel comfortable
discussing the details

13:15.753 --> 13:17.319
over our video-conference systems.

13:17.321 --> 13:18.888
Well, I suppose it's a good thing

13:18.890 --> 13:20.289
we showed up here today, then.

13:20.291 --> 13:22.691
Yes, it is, and I
appreciate your support, as always.

13:22.693 --> 13:25.494
Beatty: At the risk of
sounding cold-hearted, I'll be blunt.

13:25.496 --> 13:28.497
These events in Asia are
coming at a bad time.

13:28.499 --> 13:30.055
Our constituents in the territories

13:30.057 --> 13:31.356
are still reeling from the plague

13:31.358 --> 13:32.924
and the chaos that followed.

13:32.926 --> 13:34.526
This situation across the globe,

13:34.528 --> 13:36.895
coupled with tensions over construction...

13:36.897 --> 13:39.064
we're seeing
demonstrations in the streets.

13:39.066 --> 13:41.600
They're not peaceful vigils like
you've got going on here.

13:41.602 --> 13:45.370
We-We've got people on the
brink of... of rioting, Mr. President.

13:45.372 --> 13:46.838
I understand.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.875
So what can I do to help?

13:49.877 --> 13:51.176
Cancel the ration cards.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.844
Restore the land-claim rights.

13:52.846 --> 13:54.112
Open the markets.

13:54.114 --> 13:56.381
Rescind all of my domestic policies.

13:56.383 --> 13:58.450
They're not working and
people aren't happy.

13:58.452 --> 13:59.851
There's not much more they can take...

13:59.853 --> 14:01.386
You think you can waltz in here

14:01.388 --> 14:03.322
and leverage this crisis to muscle me?

14:03.324 --> 14:05.424
Look, when you closed
the banks for a month

14:05.426 --> 14:07.225
and then reopened them with
limited withdrawals,

14:07.227 --> 14:10.696
we supported you even though
our people were up in arms.

14:10.698 --> 14:12.197
When you used the military

14:12.199 --> 14:15.067
to forcibly remove
refugees from their shelters...

14:15.069 --> 14:17.235
Those weren't shelters.
Those were land grabs...

14:17.237 --> 14:19.971
people squatting in homes of
surviving plague victims,

14:19.973 --> 14:21.907
pushing out surviving family members

14:21.909 --> 14:23.742
who had a legitimate right to be there.

14:23.744 --> 14:26.211
- That is an oversimplification, sir.
- Is it?

14:26.213 --> 14:28.347
I'm living in a hotel next door.

14:28.349 --> 14:31.450
I've seen where you
live, Manuel, in that mansion.

14:31.452 --> 14:33.285
It's quite an upgrade from
your previous home.

14:33.287 --> 14:35.053
Tell me, do you even
know who it belongs to?

14:35.055 --> 14:36.388
Beatty: There's no reason

14:36.390 --> 14:38.357
to make this personal, Mr. President.

14:38.359 --> 14:40.892
We're here to help
you as much as ourselves.

14:40.894 --> 14:42.094
You're weak right now.

14:42.096 --> 14:44.596
With what's going on overseas...

14:44.598 --> 14:46.131
people are losing faith.

14:46.133 --> 14:48.266
You can't solve Asia... fine.

14:48.268 --> 14:51.570
Then give the
people something they want.

14:51.572 --> 14:54.373
And if I don't?

14:55.376 --> 14:58.043
I only have so much
control over my region.

14:58.045 --> 15:00.312
Some of our truckers may decide
they no longer want to volunteer

15:00.314 --> 15:02.047
to make those long-haul shipments

15:02.049 --> 15:03.582
all the way to the heartland.

15:03.584 --> 15:05.984
Suddenly, your people don't
have the supplies they need,

15:05.986 --> 15:10.122
then you don't have candles
out there, you've got pitchforks.

15:13.727 --> 15:15.026
[Sighs]

15:15.028 --> 15:19.531
Gentlemen, Mrs. Price, I'll remind you

15:19.533 --> 15:24.369
that we were sitting around this
table just five months ago.

15:24.371 --> 15:26.538
We put our hands together and we agreed

15:26.540 --> 15:28.540
that this was the best arrangement

15:28.542 --> 15:30.642
for the country under reconstruction.

15:30.644 --> 15:33.044
The presidency, here, in St. Louis

15:33.046 --> 15:36.014
with the Chief of Staff and my
Secretary of Foreign Affairs

15:36.016 --> 15:38.583
chosen from your regions.

15:38.585 --> 15:41.653
Senator Beatty with the
constitutional authority

15:41.655 --> 15:45.557
to ratify certain new laws,
and I thank you for that...

15:45.559 --> 15:48.260
and an expectation that all of you

15:48.262 --> 15:51.563
would try to maintain
control over your regions

15:51.565 --> 15:55.367
until we sorted out how the
boundaries could be drawn

15:55.369 --> 15:57.502
or whether or not we
needed to elect new governors.

15:57.504 --> 16:01.673
Now, we've got congressional
elections coming up next month,

16:01.675 --> 16:06.111
after which the people, through
the voice of the new Congress,

16:06.113 --> 16:09.648
can decide whether or
not to retain my policies.

16:09.650 --> 16:15.120
Until then, I say this... get
a handle on your people.

16:15.122 --> 16:18.557
If you can't and you really fear rioting,

16:18.559 --> 16:21.526
I will not hesitate to use
the full force of our armed forces

16:21.528 --> 16:24.329
to maintain order in this country.

16:29.236 --> 16:31.736
Now, I have a job to do, and so do you.

16:31.738 --> 16:36.908
As your president, I
advise all of you to get to it.

16:36.910 --> 16:41.947
Thank you for coming and
have a safe trip back.

16:41.949 --> 16:43.181
[Door opens]

16:43.183 --> 16:45.484
[Indistinct conversation]

17:13.193 --> 17:15.093
How's she doing, doc?

17:15.095 --> 17:17.060
Malaria's a funny disease.

17:17.063 --> 17:18.396
It comes in waves.

17:18.397 --> 17:21.232
She's in a lull now.

17:22.535 --> 17:25.636
I don't need to tell
you, we can't lose her.

17:25.637 --> 17:28.706
She's gonna be touch and go for a bit.

17:29.743 --> 17:32.276
And the baby?

17:32.278 --> 17:36.180
If I can't get the fever
spikes under control...

17:43.389 --> 17:44.622
A highly placed source tells me

17:44.624 --> 17:46.023
there is currently broad suspicion

17:46.025 --> 17:48.826
that CNO Tom Chandler
is no longer in China,

17:48.828 --> 17:50.762
but is, in fact, onboard the Nathan James

17:50.764 --> 17:53.231
in pursuit of man called
Takehaya and the hostages.

17:53.233 --> 17:54.766
Whether or not they're making progress,

17:54.768 --> 17:56.768
no one can tell us, except
the man behind that door,

17:56.770 --> 17:57.802
which remains closed.

17:57.804 --> 17:59.403
No questions have been answered today.

17:59.405 --> 18:01.005
Kara: What do you think you're doing?

18:01.007 --> 18:02.240
Turn that off.

18:02.242 --> 18:03.908
Where did you hear that?

18:03.910 --> 18:05.376
So it's true.

18:05.378 --> 18:08.079
Judging by your reaction,
there's no good news.

18:08.081 --> 18:09.614
Get him out of here.

18:16.189 --> 18:17.989
There's no one in there.

18:17.991 --> 18:19.957
They all left for the night.

18:19.959 --> 18:21.359
Who told you about Chandler?

18:21.361 --> 18:22.693
Who do you think?

18:22.695 --> 18:24.695
One of the regional leaders.

18:25.532 --> 18:28.132
Don't you see how
you're being manipulated?

18:28.134 --> 18:31.068
I think it's you and the administration
that are doing the manipulating.

18:31.070 --> 18:34.639
- We could freeze your credentials.
- I thought we still had a free press.

18:38.578 --> 18:41.746
Jacob, this is a sensitive operation.

18:41.748 --> 18:45.616
I am begging you, do
not run that story...

18:45.618 --> 18:47.051
not now.

18:47.053 --> 18:50.321
What do I get?

18:52.158 --> 18:55.426
A sit-down with the president...

18:55.428 --> 18:57.295
- one-on-one.
- Today?

18:57.297 --> 18:58.496
Tomorrow.

18:58.498 --> 19:01.632
Just give us 24 hours.

19:01.634 --> 19:02.900
[Sighs]

19:04.337 --> 19:08.272
You got 12.

19:11.644 --> 19:14.145
Sasha: I can't tell how
fast they're moving.

19:14.147 --> 19:16.547
Lucky for us, the motors are very small

19:16.549 --> 19:18.549
and the mines are very large,

19:18.551 --> 19:21.018
and we're 1/4 mile from the closest one.

19:21.020 --> 19:24.288
Well, how soon till the
first one closes in on us?

19:24.290 --> 19:27.458
TAO estimates approximately 44 minutes,

19:27.460 --> 19:30.962
with the next wave
a few minutes later...

19:30.964 --> 19:34.699
if we're still here.

19:38.037 --> 19:41.405
Has anyone talked
about evacuating the ship

19:41.407 --> 19:43.307
while we still have time?

19:43.309 --> 19:45.042
We canvassed the crew.

19:45.044 --> 19:47.745
No one's leaving.

19:55.755 --> 19:58.723
Burk: We already lost one man. I'm
not gonna lose another. What do we do?

19:58.725 --> 20:00.391
Danny: I say we send
the divers out again,

20:00.393 --> 20:02.727
we attach C-4 charges to each
mine, we blow them up one by one.

20:02.729 --> 20:04.462
Cameron: That could
cause a chain reaction

20:04.464 --> 20:06.631
- and blow the whole minefield.
- Burk: You got a better idea?

20:06.633 --> 20:08.733
Put flotation gear on them. Get
them to rise to the surface,

20:08.735 --> 20:11.869
ship takes them out one
by one with the 50-cals.

20:11.871 --> 20:13.771
Not enough time.

20:13.773 --> 20:17.942
TAO... we still have both Nixies?

20:17.944 --> 20:20.344
Yes, sir. Full working order.

20:20.346 --> 20:22.580
How's that gonna help us?

20:23.950 --> 20:26.117
We drag a Nixie behind
us to fool a torpedo.

20:26.119 --> 20:28.920
What's to stop us from
having it trick the mines?

20:31.090 --> 20:34.091
Rig the Nixie tube to
the batteries on the helo,

20:34.093 --> 20:35.626
crank up the sound generator,

20:35.628 --> 20:38.496
and tow it through the
minefield ahead of us.

20:38.498 --> 20:39.864
So the sound it puts out

20:39.866 --> 20:41.866
triggers the sonically
activated mines to blow

20:41.868 --> 20:43.601
and creates a path for the ship.

20:43.603 --> 20:46.604
And we follow the helo's
track as it clears a lane.

20:48.207 --> 20:49.507
How fast can you rig it?

20:49.509 --> 20:52.076
Less than 10, sir. I'm on it.

20:55.715 --> 20:58.382
Sir, I don't think Jesse's helo

20:58.384 --> 21:00.151
can cover enough water in
the time that we have.

21:00.153 --> 21:03.354
You may get a path out, but
by the time it's clear,

21:03.356 --> 21:05.589
the mines on our
flank are gonna take us out.

21:05.591 --> 21:08.693
We can rig the second
Nixie to one of the RHIBs.

21:08.695 --> 21:11.896
You let my team run
interference on the weak side.

21:11.898 --> 21:13.831
You'll be racing over
the mines as the detonate.

21:13.833 --> 21:15.333
We got 100 yards of cable, sir.

21:15.335 --> 21:18.169
We... We put the
Nixie far enough behind us,

21:18.171 --> 21:19.370
it takes the blows.

21:19.372 --> 21:20.938
We keep moving through.

21:20.940 --> 21:23.741
It's the only way.

21:28.114 --> 21:31.482
Get it done.

21:42.395 --> 21:44.428
What is it?

21:44.430 --> 21:48.132
Sir, um...

21:49.769 --> 21:53.137
Driving the RHIB could
be a two-man job,

21:53.139 --> 21:54.538
if it had to be.

21:54.540 --> 21:58.676
Wolf and me... we don't
have wives and kids at home.

22:00.213 --> 22:02.113
Green doesn't need to join.

22:06.552 --> 22:08.953

22:08.955 --> 22:10.328

be assigned off the ship,

make it out of here...

please forward the following

23:05.443 --> 23:07.410
But if you do...

23:07.412 --> 23:10.146

I wish I could have been there more.

you and Lieutenant
Green will cover the lookouts.

to Okinawa any way you can.

to send our other ships,

24:47.545 --> 24:49.145
find our people.

25:29.087 --> 25:30.820
- And who leaked it?
- He wouldn't tell me.

25:30.822 --> 25:32.388
Michener: It could've
been any one of them.

25:32.390 --> 25:33.656
What does it matter now?

25:33.658 --> 25:34.991
It sounds like you got their backs up

25:34.993 --> 25:36.225
when you threatened martial law.

25:36.227 --> 25:37.860
For all we know, it could be the leaders

25:37.862 --> 25:39.395
stoking the flames with their people.

25:39.397 --> 25:40.620
And even if they are,

25:40.621 --> 25:42.432
we can't risk going toe-to-toe
with them right now.

25:42.434 --> 25:43.866
She's right.

25:43.868 --> 25:45.668
The crisis in Asia trumps
our domestic agenda.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.470
We need to throw them a bone,

25:47.472 --> 25:48.938
make some kind of concession.

25:48.940 --> 25:50.873
Unless the James makes
it out of that minefield.

25:50.875 --> 25:51.756
I'm sorry, Kara.

25:51.857 --> 25:53.364
I know your husband's on that ship,

25:53.365 --> 25:57.013
but we can not count on the
James surviving to bail us out.

25:57.015 --> 25:59.782
Michener: Even if they
do, there's no bailing us out.

25:59.784 --> 26:01.384
The leaders smell blood in the water.

26:01.386 --> 26:02.618
What do you want to give them?

26:02.620 --> 26:04.620
Nothing, except maybe my middle finger.

26:04.622 --> 26:06.255
- Sir...
- Nothing, Alex.

26:06.257 --> 26:08.057
We give them nothing.

26:08.893 --> 26:10.493
CNO on the bridge.

26:10.495 --> 26:12.829
How far to the closest mine?

26:12.831 --> 26:14.464
110 yards, sir.

26:14.466 --> 26:16.566
8 minutes till impact.

26:16.568 --> 26:18.901
[Helicopter blades whirring]

26:22.173 --> 26:24.173
Let's go.

26:43.228 --> 26:45.328
Cruz: <i>Nathan James, RHIB is in position.</i>

26:45.330 --> 26:46.274
Commence engine engagement

26:46.299 --> 26:47.363
- procedure.
- Alisha: Aye, sir.

26:47.365 --> 26:49.599
OOD, engage shafts port and starboard.

26:49.601 --> 26:52.134
Engage shafts port and starboard.

26:52.136 --> 26:54.203
Engaging.

26:56.941 --> 26:58.508
We have turns on port shaft.

26:58.510 --> 26:59.876
We have turns on starboard shaft.

26:59.878 --> 27:03.079
Sasha: Releasing the Nixie now.

27:07.185 --> 27:09.819
Chandler: OOD, ahead 2/3 knots.

27:09.821 --> 27:12.822
We do not want to wake up those mines.

27:12.824 --> 27:14.690
We stay a Quiet One.

27:14.692 --> 27:17.026
CCS, CIC, maintain Quiet One.

27:17.028 --> 27:21.264
Helm, no less than 1,000
yards from that helo.

27:21.266 --> 27:23.900
- Give it room to work in front of us.
- Aye, sir.

27:36.928 --> 27:39.162
Gator: Approaching the
first set now, sir.

27:39.164 --> 27:41.598
Port side.

27:42.434 --> 27:45.835
[Explosions]

27:58.717 --> 28:01.251
Five degrees starboard!

28:01.253 --> 28:04.053
Come to 0-2-1-2.

28:04.055 --> 28:07.023
The next group is right...

28:07.025 --> 28:09.092
Oh!

28:11.363 --> 28:13.263
There!

28:13.265 --> 28:14.697
That was close.

28:14.699 --> 28:16.499
Two more sets.

28:16.501 --> 28:18.368
[Explosions]

28:18.370 --> 28:21.571
Cruz and Wolf, you're up.

28:21.573 --> 28:23.106
Port side.

28:23.108 --> 28:24.774
Steady now.

28:26.411 --> 28:30.680
Got three of them coming
right up, bearing 2-2-5.

28:37.556 --> 28:39.189
Chandler: Nicely done, gentlemen.

28:42.627 --> 28:45.128
How many was that?

28:45.130 --> 28:46.863
I count 12.

29:01.313 --> 29:02.846
[Whispers]

29:02.848 --> 29:05.248
[Inhales deeply]

29:22.734 --> 29:24.567
Sir, maintaining current speed,

29:24.569 --> 29:26.569
we'll reach the end of the minefield

29:26.571 --> 29:28.004
in less than four minutes.

29:28.006 --> 29:29.672
How we doing, Green?

29:31.209 --> 29:32.542
That's four!

29:32.544 --> 29:35.011
How many left along this line?

29:35.013 --> 29:37.380
I count three remaining.

29:39.951 --> 29:42.919
There! Hold that.

29:42.921 --> 29:45.088
200 yards on this bearing.

29:45.090 --> 29:48.625
By our count, we've got
three sets left, sir.

29:48.627 --> 29:50.193
Chandler: Copy that.

29:50.195 --> 29:52.662
Alpha team, 2 more sets... 100
yards off our starboard bow.

29:52.664 --> 29:54.530
Bearing 1-6-5.

29:54.532 --> 29:56.599
Got it, sir. On it. Brace, Wolf.

29:56.601 --> 29:58.801
We're turning.

30:03.375 --> 30:06.242
Alpha team, we've got the
same problem midships port side.

30:06.244 --> 30:08.044
Cruz: Heading to your port side.

30:08.046 --> 30:09.913
Permission to increase speed, sir.

30:09.915 --> 30:11.781
No more than 15 knots.

30:11.783 --> 30:13.249
We don't want your engine noise

30:13.251 --> 30:15.285
to set off the whole damn minefield.

30:15.287 --> 30:17.754
Aye aye, Captain.

30:19.791 --> 30:21.090
Hydrophone effects.

30:21.092 --> 30:23.559
I hear hydrophone effects, sir.

30:23.561 --> 30:25.161
Jesus.

30:28.934 --> 30:30.833
Captain, we've got hydrophone effects.

30:30.835 --> 30:32.635
Torpedo incoming. Where?

30:32.637 --> 30:34.203
- [Alarm blaring]
- Son of a bitch.

30:34.205 --> 30:35.972
Where the hell did that come from?

30:35.974 --> 30:37.407
Calculating vector, sir.

30:37.409 --> 30:38.641
All engines ahead flank!

30:38.643 --> 30:41.144
Sonar, radar, find me a contact.

30:41.146 --> 30:44.113
There's a ship out there somewhere.

30:44.115 --> 30:48.351
Wolf, Cruz, be advised torpedo incoming.

30:48.353 --> 30:51.821
Inbound. 7 miles out, doing... 60 knots.

30:54.392 --> 30:56.225
[Explosion]

30:57.929 --> 31:00.296
Danny: We have not
swept all the mines, sir!

31:00.298 --> 31:04.167
You are not clear to overtake us!

31:04.169 --> 31:06.369
Sir, no room to evade port or starboard.

31:06.371 --> 31:08.504
Sir, torpedo appears to be a VA-111

31:08.506 --> 31:11.407
big enough to blow the
entire minefield around us.

31:11.409 --> 31:14.544
TAO, what's the bearing on that torpedo?

31:14.546 --> 31:18.247
Bearing 2-4-0 to the
ship... 2-4-5 to you.

31:21.419 --> 31:23.353
You got that?

31:23.355 --> 31:25.488
I got it.

31:27.826 --> 31:29.192
[Alarm blaring]

31:29.194 --> 31:31.260
What are they doing?

31:33.999 --> 31:37.100
They're going for the torpedo.

31:37.102 --> 31:39.535
Danny: Holy shit. They're
trying to intercept it.

31:39.537 --> 31:41.137
Can that work?

31:42.440 --> 31:45.008
If they don't intercept far enough out,

31:45.010 --> 31:47.176
the shock waves will
set all the mines off

31:47.178 --> 31:48.478
and kill everyone anyway.

31:48.480 --> 31:51.214
Wolf, let out as much line as you can.

31:52.050 --> 31:55.818
Captain, 15 knots will
not allow us to intercept.

31:55.820 --> 31:57.387
Sir, the Nixie needs to hit that torpedo

31:57.389 --> 31:58.988
beyond the edge of the minefield.

31:58.990 --> 32:01.324
- Gun it, Cruz.
- Cruz: Copy that, sir.

32:06.631 --> 32:08.264
[Alarm blaring]

32:12.904 --> 32:14.470
Ah! [Grunts]

32:17.208 --> 32:19.242
Disengage overpower governors.

32:21.012 --> 32:22.311
Jesse, you need to hustle.

32:22.313 --> 32:24.047
Those mines are gonna be exploding

32:24.049 --> 32:26.215
right under our bow if
we get any closer to you.

32:26.217 --> 32:29.952
I go any faster, I'm gonna
pull the Nixie out of the water.

32:32.857 --> 32:35.091
[Explosions]

32:36.661 --> 32:38.127
Cruz, 400 yards.

32:38.129 --> 32:40.063
Flare to starboard on my call.

32:40.065 --> 32:42.598
- [Groans]
- Cruz: Hold on, Wolf!

32:42.600 --> 32:44.600
300 yards.

32:44.602 --> 32:48.071
Hold 2-4-5. Now 2-4-7.

32:48.073 --> 32:51.007
When this thing goes, you do your
damndest to stay in that boat.

32:51.009 --> 32:52.442
Roger that!

32:53.511 --> 32:56.012
[Grunting]

32:56.014 --> 32:59.449
200 yards.

32:59.451 --> 33:02.752
100 yards. Brace!

33:02.754 --> 33:04.921
When it goes...

33:04.923 --> 33:09.125
dive down, lie flat, hold on.

33:09.127 --> 33:13.429
Fire in 3, 2, 1...

33:13.431 --> 33:15.331
Now!

33:18.803 --> 33:22.789
[Explosion]

33:29.881 --> 33:32.915
Shockwave coming!

33:32.917 --> 33:35.184
Brace! Brace! Brace!

33:57.575 --> 34:00.943
TAO.

34:07.085 --> 34:09.518
We're clear, Captain.

34:12.357 --> 34:16.225
Alisha: Wolf, Cruz, come in, over.

34:17.896 --> 34:20.263
[Sighs]

34:22.699 --> 34:26.569
Lookouts to the rail.

34:28.473 --> 34:31.206
Prepare to form a search party.

34:31.208 --> 34:34.524
Alisha: Wolf, Cruz, come in, over.

34:57.039 --> 35:00.740
Anything?

35:00.742 --> 35:03.376
You got them?

35:12.421 --> 35:13.420
Burk?

35:13.422 --> 35:15.922
Burk: There's no sign of them, sir.

35:15.924 --> 35:18.425
Just some pieces of the RHIB.

35:23.365 --> 35:24.965
How you doing on fuel, Jesse?

35:24.967 --> 35:27.267
Jesse: Uh, plenty.

35:27.269 --> 35:30.170
Going in for another sweep now.

35:30.172 --> 35:34.674
North-northwest heading
3-3-0 to 3-4-3.

35:46.621 --> 35:49.222
That torpedo came from somewhere.

35:49.224 --> 35:51.725
No contacts on radar or sonar, sir.

35:51.727 --> 35:56.830
These islands here, they
could be taking cover anywhere.

35:58.700 --> 36:02.502
[Shouting]

36:08.777 --> 36:12.004
[Sighs]

36:38.940 --> 36:40.142
Shh.

36:59.561 --> 37:02.896
We're taking another pass, sir.

37:04.933 --> 37:06.933
Green?

37:06.935 --> 37:12.272
I got nothing, sir.

37:50.712 --> 37:53.313
There! There!

37:57.319 --> 37:59.752
God damn.

38:00.989 --> 38:04.457
Captain, you're never gonna believe this.

38:05.293 --> 38:07.327
- We got them.
- [Cheering]

38:07.329 --> 38:09.829
We got them, sir. We got them.

38:09.831 --> 38:11.264
[Laughs]

38:11.266 --> 38:12.932
[Cheers]

38:12.934 --> 38:14.367
All right!

38:14.369 --> 38:19.973
[Cheers and applause]

38:27.482 --> 38:31.484
- Yes!
- Coming home to Mother.

38:48.069 --> 38:50.637
- Watch yourself.
- Got him.

38:56.778 --> 39:00.680
[Chatter]

39:02.284 --> 39:04.751
Sir, we have word from Nathan James.

39:04.753 --> 39:07.954
They made it out of the minefield.

39:07.956 --> 39:10.156
They think they're
closing in on Takehaya.

39:10.158 --> 39:11.524
Well...

39:11.526 --> 39:15.562
we live to fight another day.

39:17.365 --> 39:19.966
[Sighs]

39:26.942 --> 39:31.044
Make yourself at home.

39:34.816 --> 39:37.684
You've got a soft spot for him.

39:39.921 --> 39:42.288
Green.

39:42.290 --> 39:44.557
He's my best operator.

39:46.394 --> 39:49.429
I wanted you protected...

39:49.431 --> 39:51.798
if it went to hell.

39:51.800 --> 39:55.001
So you've got a soft spot for me?

39:55.003 --> 39:58.471
That's never been much of a secret.

40:04.045 --> 40:09.015
I've always run
things as a solo operation.

40:11.019 --> 40:15.455
Must be such a burden, having
to make all those decisions...

40:15.457 --> 40:18.057
everyone's lives in your hands.

40:18.059 --> 40:21.694
It's the job.

40:23.932 --> 40:28.801
Well... you do it with grace.

40:34.509 --> 40:39.112
[Sighs]

40:50.759 --> 40:54.994
I really did not want to lose you today.

40:59.567 --> 41:02.402
[Door opens]

41:13.581 --> 41:17.356
Chandler: I'm gonna get there, Mike.
