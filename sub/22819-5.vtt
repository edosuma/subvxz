WEBVTT

00:55.932 --> 00:59.853
We must call the faithful
to the cathedral to
celebrate High Mass

01:00.019 --> 01:03.148
and the delivery of York
from the pagans!

01:05.608 --> 01:06.818
I agree, Sire.

01:07.777 --> 01:09.446
God works in mysterious ways.

01:11.072 --> 01:13.700
Listen. The bells.

01:17.829 --> 01:19.414
My son.

01:19.706 --> 01:20.707
Mannel, thank you.

01:28.131 --> 01:29.132
Father.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.008
Father!

03:01.849 --> 03:02.976
Heahmund.

03:03.476 --> 03:06.479
Fight for your God
and protect your King!

03:07.063 --> 03:08.648
Sire, this way.

03:19.075 --> 03:20.076
Sire.

03:20.577 --> 03:21.578
Stay down!

03:28.084 --> 03:29.877
Men, defend!

03:29.961 --> 03:30.962
Cuthred, with me.

03:31.212 --> 03:32.213
Form up.

03:37.969 --> 03:39.220
Charge!

03:46.686 --> 03:47.854
Mannel!

03:49.772 --> 03:50.773
Push through.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.191
Cover.

03:53.818 --> 03:54.819
Fight on.

04:34.233 --> 04:37.612
Let every soul be subject
to a higher power.

04:37.820 --> 04:40.615
For there is no power
but that of God.

04:59.884 --> 05:00.885
Die!

05:01.219 --> 05:02.220
Die!

05:02.553 --> 05:03.554
Die!

05:07.767 --> 05:09.477
Die! Die!

05:12.522 --> 05:13.523
Come on!

05:20.029 --> 05:21.030
Come on.

05:36.254 --> 05:37.463
Sire, back.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.445
Alfred. Alfred!

06:16.377 --> 06:17.378
Alfred.

06:23.092 --> 06:25.386
Bear not your sword in vain.

06:25.720 --> 06:26.804
Fight!

06:38.775 --> 06:40.193
Hold the wall!

06:42.069 --> 06:43.321
Spears!

07:01.756 --> 07:02.757
Go on.

08:57.622 --> 08:58.623
Sire!

09:00.708 --> 09:03.336
Sire, you must leave.
You must run.

09:03.419 --> 09:04.587
No, no!

09:05.254 --> 09:06.631
I would rather die.

09:06.714 --> 09:09.133
Save your son at least,
if you don't care
about yourself.

09:10.593 --> 09:11.594
You are right.

09:12.595 --> 09:13.596
You are right.

09:14.472 --> 09:16.015
You lead, I'll follow.

09:16.933 --> 09:17.934
Alfred.

09:18.976 --> 09:22.688
Protect your King.
Die like men!

09:45.086 --> 09:46.087
Good God.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.464
No! No!

10:23.457 --> 10:24.792
Heathen!

10:30.631 --> 10:31.799
Christian.

12:03.641 --> 12:04.642
Father!

12:04.725 --> 12:06.644
Help me get
this man in the tent.
Father.

12:16.195 --> 12:18.030
What happened?
Are you all right, Father?

12:18.280 --> 12:19.865
Aethelwulf.
They, uh...

12:20.407 --> 12:22.243
What happened?
They surprised us.

12:22.326 --> 12:23.327
Alfred.

12:23.661 --> 12:24.787
They were hiding.

12:25.371 --> 12:26.372
Sit down.

12:26.455 --> 12:27.790
- I don't...
- Sit.

12:27.873 --> 12:28.874
All right.

12:30.835 --> 12:32.878
Mannel? My cousin?
Where is Mannel?

12:33.087 --> 12:34.296
He urged us to leave.

12:34.839 --> 12:36.132
He told us he would follow.

12:37.508 --> 12:38.551
He stayed behind.

12:41.137 --> 12:43.264
He died trying
to protect our escape.

12:47.059 --> 12:48.060
Heahmund.

12:48.602 --> 12:49.603
Heahmund.

12:49.854 --> 12:50.980
Bishop Heahmund.

12:51.063 --> 12:52.314
Surely he survived?

12:52.398 --> 12:54.066
He survived.
Surely he didn't die?

13:07.454 --> 13:11.250
I thought that God
had at last seen fit

13:12.376 --> 13:17.798
to be merciful unto us
and forgive us.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.385
I was wrong, Judith.

13:22.094 --> 13:23.262
I was wrong.

13:26.140 --> 13:28.100
We must suffer.

13:28.601 --> 13:30.060
We must suffer.

15:34.727 --> 15:35.811
<i>Marhaba.</i>

15:36.020 --> 15:37.938
Allah be praised,
you have arrived safely.

15:38.439 --> 15:41.650
Now, please,
come into the tent and
relax after your journey.

15:42.234 --> 15:43.736
The Emir
will join you shortly.

15:44.695 --> 15:45.946
Your weapons, please.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.204
<i>Ja.</i>

17:34.972 --> 17:36.682
How can you speak
our language?

17:37.391 --> 17:38.392
That is easy.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.936
I have met Rus Vikings

17:41.019 --> 17:43.438
from the Kievan Empire
many times.

17:44.148 --> 17:46.316
I have been pleased
to have helped them
with the Emperor.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.779
Are you not the enemy
of the Emperor?

17:52.072 --> 17:53.198
By no means.

17:54.116 --> 17:55.117
Why?

17:56.785 --> 17:58.829
Why should I seek
such an enemy?

18:06.879 --> 18:07.921
Ah.

18:09.006 --> 18:11.091
There are many things
you do not understand

18:11.175 --> 18:14.136
about how the world
works here.

18:16.221 --> 18:21.268
If you take my advice,
you will just take it
as it appears.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.478
That is the best way.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.316
Now, we have
a trade deal to make.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.736
How can I get furs,
swords, falcons,

18:31.195 --> 18:33.488
bear skins, whale meat...

18:33.697 --> 18:35.282
and your slaves are the best.

18:35.365 --> 18:38.327
Everybody knows that.

18:38.702 --> 18:41.622
We Arabs pride ourselves
on our hospitality,

18:41.705 --> 18:46.543
so, if there's anything
I can do to make your stay
here more comfortable,

18:46.835 --> 18:51.965
or more pleasant, please,
do not be afraid to ask.

19:24.081 --> 19:25.499
Why are they following him?

19:31.421 --> 19:32.422
Floki.

19:35.634 --> 19:37.302
Floki has returned!

20:06.373 --> 20:07.374
Floki.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.756
I never thought
I'd see you again.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.802
Not in this lifetime anyway.

20:19.720 --> 20:20.721
No.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.099
It's strange for me, too,

20:25.976 --> 20:28.478
to be back here
in this Great Hall.

20:31.815 --> 20:36.236
If I listen carefully,
I can still hear the sound
of Earl Haraldson's voice.

20:38.739 --> 20:40.198
And Ragnar's voice.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.826
Always Ragnar's voice.

20:44.578 --> 20:46.913
Such memories
we've shared, Lagertha.

20:47.873 --> 20:48.874
Yes.

20:56.965 --> 20:58.967
So much has happened
to me, Lagertha.

20:59.593 --> 21:00.594
So much.

21:01.261 --> 21:02.804
I don't know who I am.

21:03.889 --> 21:06.141
You are Floki the boatbuilder.

21:07.684 --> 21:09.353
I am more than that.

21:11.813 --> 21:12.814
Floki.

21:13.857 --> 21:15.734
Ubbe.

21:16.568 --> 21:19.863
The last time I saw you,
you were sailing away
in a small boat

21:19.946 --> 21:21.281
with no means of navigation.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.075
You had given yourself
to the gods.

21:23.367 --> 21:25.077
Oh, and the gods provided.

21:25.744 --> 21:26.745
In what way?

21:28.330 --> 21:29.623
They took me to a place.

21:31.249 --> 21:32.709
A special place.

21:33.502 --> 21:36.505
I was dead
and then I was alive.

21:37.130 --> 21:40.675
And then, I came ashore.
And I was in this
special place.

21:41.468 --> 21:42.969
Where was this place?

21:43.470 --> 21:47.682
At the edge of everything,
and yet at the very center
of it all.

21:48.141 --> 21:49.559
There is no one else there.

21:51.269 --> 21:52.270
No one?

21:53.063 --> 21:54.064
No humans.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.108
Only the gods.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.619
Huh.

22:12.416 --> 22:14.918
Why did you
come back here, Floki?

22:15.877 --> 22:20.674
Because I felt that
it was wrong to keep
this amazing place to myself.

22:21.508 --> 22:22.634
I want to share it.

22:23.260 --> 22:24.261
With whom?

22:24.344 --> 22:26.263
With those who believe
in the true gods.

22:27.639 --> 22:30.642
I only want those
who are pure in spirit
and heart.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.520
This place is only fit
for true believers.

22:34.521 --> 22:36.106
Like you?
Yes.

22:36.857 --> 22:37.858
Like me.

22:39.234 --> 22:40.652
But not like me?

22:42.404 --> 22:43.572
Or not like Ragnar?

22:43.655 --> 22:46.950
We were never pure
like you are.

22:47.409 --> 22:48.410
I can't say.

22:49.911 --> 22:50.912
All I know

22:51.329 --> 22:54.583
is that the gods
have sent me here
to find kindred spirits.

22:55.208 --> 22:58.753
Those who are willing
to live pure lives
among the gods.

23:00.046 --> 23:04.968
You would
take these warriors and
shield-maidens away from here,

23:05.218 --> 23:06.928
to your special place?

23:07.095 --> 23:08.096
Yes!

23:08.680 --> 23:10.348
If they were willing
to come with me.

23:16.855 --> 23:18.023
In that case,

23:19.900 --> 23:21.902
I must warn you,
my friend.

23:22.486 --> 23:24.112
This is my kingdom.

23:24.279 --> 23:25.530
I rule Kattegat.

23:25.614 --> 23:28.825
And I must protect it,
and look after it
and its people.

23:29.367 --> 23:33.455
Especially now,
when we have every reason
to expect another attack

23:33.538 --> 23:35.207
from the forces
of King Harald.

23:35.999 --> 23:37.709
The last thing I need

23:37.876 --> 23:42.672
is for someone to take away
my best warriors,
my best hopes.

23:43.048 --> 23:45.467
Our best hopes.

23:49.221 --> 23:51.056
You mustn't
try to do it, Floki.

23:51.765 --> 23:52.891
I forbid you.

23:54.017 --> 23:55.310
Do you understand?

23:58.563 --> 23:59.898
Do you understand?

24:29.094 --> 24:30.845
The Emir
has sent you both a gift.

24:32.889 --> 24:34.558
This one is for you.

24:36.059 --> 24:38.603
And this one is for you.

24:42.357 --> 24:43.358
Enjoy.

25:07.799 --> 25:08.883
Mmm.

26:33.551 --> 26:34.928
How was your evening?

26:37.389 --> 26:39.682
Very satisfactory.

26:44.396 --> 26:45.397
And yours?

26:49.067 --> 26:50.193
She was...

26:52.570 --> 26:53.571
Not a she.

26:58.159 --> 26:59.786
What?
You heard.

27:04.791 --> 27:05.834
Hmm.

27:06.876 --> 27:08.002
And, uh,

27:10.588 --> 27:11.589
was that

27:12.590 --> 27:13.925
a problem for you?

27:21.015 --> 27:22.016
I'm starving.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.191
You mustn't be afraid.

27:31.443 --> 27:36.823
This land has no wars,
no diseases, no suffering.

27:38.450 --> 27:40.160
Blessed by the gods
in every way.

27:40.952 --> 27:42.287
And the soil is good.

27:42.871 --> 27:45.540
Good farming soil
just waiting for you
to plant it.

27:46.207 --> 27:47.459
It seems too good to be true.

27:47.542 --> 27:51.379
The only way to understand it
is that the gods
meant it for us.

27:51.963 --> 27:54.048
Meant it for true believers.

27:55.508 --> 27:57.051
And the climate is good?

27:57.844 --> 27:59.012
The earth rich?

27:59.471 --> 28:00.472
Yes, my friend.

28:01.806 --> 28:04.017
How come
we have never found
this place before?

28:04.684 --> 28:07.770
Because the gods were
waiting for the right people
to find it.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.148
We don't want
to bring too many.

28:11.024 --> 28:13.485
Just enough for a working
colony of believers.

28:13.568 --> 28:14.652
That's all.

28:14.903 --> 28:15.945
And then,

28:16.279 --> 28:18.531
And then, can you imagine
how perfect life will be?

28:19.741 --> 28:22.744
The perfect conditions
for the growth of the crops,

28:23.411 --> 28:25.288
and for the growth
of the spirit.

28:32.086 --> 28:33.421
You can't go, Guthrum.

28:33.838 --> 28:36.382
Why not? I can
make my own mind up.

28:44.098 --> 28:45.517
Floki is crazy.

28:45.808 --> 28:46.893
Can't you see that?

28:47.685 --> 28:49.229
No one can
believe him anymore.

28:49.854 --> 28:51.731
He makes absolute
sense to me.

28:51.981 --> 28:53.483
It's what my father
would've wanted.

28:56.194 --> 28:58.738
Your father didn't
see this new world.

28:59.113 --> 29:01.324
In any case, he wouldn't
have wanted to run away.

29:01.658 --> 29:02.742
To hide under a rock,

29:02.825 --> 29:05.036
to pretend nothing else
in this world existed.

29:06.246 --> 29:08.081
That is what
Floki is offering.

29:08.289 --> 29:09.582
I still want to go.

29:09.832 --> 29:10.875
And betray Lagertha?

29:10.959 --> 29:12.585
The gods are more important.

29:12.669 --> 29:14.045
But it's not your fate.

29:15.380 --> 29:16.381
I know that.

29:17.048 --> 29:18.758
You can't go,
and that's the end of it.

29:20.343 --> 29:21.553
You cannot stop me.

29:42.240 --> 29:45.243
The Saxon army,
or what remains of it,

29:45.326 --> 29:47.328
has abandoned
their camp and left.

29:56.629 --> 30:00.008
If we want to,
we can pursue them
and destroy them.

30:02.176 --> 30:04.220
I think we have
more important things to do.

30:05.888 --> 30:07.432
We must look to Kattegat.

30:07.765 --> 30:11.519
What if Ubbe kills Lagertha,
or persuades her
to crown him King?

30:12.020 --> 30:14.897
The loss of our home base
would be a devastating blow.

30:17.150 --> 30:18.901
We need to sort things out.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.571
We must kill
Ubbe and Lagertha,

30:22.196 --> 30:26.701
and you must be crowned
King of Kattegat,
before Bjorn returns.

30:30.163 --> 30:33.583
You are making more
and more sense, my brother.

30:36.085 --> 30:37.086
Good man.

30:39.297 --> 30:44.135
I remember also that
King Harald has an ambition
of invading Kattegat.

30:45.511 --> 30:46.763
In the short term,

30:48.264 --> 30:50.600
we should make an alliance
and work with him.

30:51.809 --> 30:54.479
This time we will
truly quit York,

30:54.687 --> 30:58.691
though leaving a big enough
garrison to keep it safe
until our return.

30:59.150 --> 31:00.193
Hmm?

31:02.236 --> 31:03.821
And what of our prisoner?

31:03.946 --> 31:04.947
This bishop.

31:05.948 --> 31:08.701
Well, what do you propose?

31:09.243 --> 31:10.745
He seems
like an important man.

31:10.828 --> 31:14.207
We could offer him back
to the Saxons
for a great ransom.

31:15.333 --> 31:16.876
Or we could crucify him.

31:16.959 --> 31:18.127
That would be fun.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.468
Blessed is he who walked not
in the council of the ungodly.

31:26.719 --> 31:29.472
Nor standeth in the way
of the sinner,

31:29.555 --> 31:32.308
nor seated in the seat
of the scornful.

31:37.188 --> 31:39.649
For he delights
in the law of the Lord

31:40.691 --> 31:43.903
and in that law
doth he meditate night and day

31:47.490 --> 31:52.036
And he should be
planted like a tree
by the rivers of water.

31:53.538 --> 31:55.206
That bringeth forth his fruit.

31:56.707 --> 31:58.042
In his season.

32:08.344 --> 32:10.513
You call me a heathen,

32:11.973 --> 32:13.599
but to me, I am godly.

32:14.350 --> 32:15.643
I live by the gods.

32:15.726 --> 32:17.437
There is only one God.

32:17.770 --> 32:20.481
But I have seen other gods.

32:21.566 --> 32:23.067
I have seen Odin,

32:23.526 --> 32:25.903
the All-Father,
with my own eyes.

32:28.114 --> 32:29.657
They are the Devil's work.

32:31.200 --> 32:34.454
He conjures up demons
and fallen angels
to beguile us

32:35.329 --> 32:36.831
and lead us into evil.

32:39.542 --> 32:41.627
What is evil? Hmm?

32:45.423 --> 32:46.841
The slaughter of the innocent.

32:47.216 --> 32:49.010
You slaughter
when it suits you.

32:49.302 --> 32:52.597
He who chooses to be heathen
is not innocent.

32:54.724 --> 32:56.684
But I could show you
the ways of God.

32:57.393 --> 33:02.023
I could bring you to salvation
and to eternal life.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.695
Do you know who I am?

33:09.363 --> 33:10.364
Of course.

33:12.074 --> 33:16.329
You are Ivar,
son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

33:18.456 --> 33:21.584
And many there are
who fear you.

33:22.126 --> 33:23.169
Hmm.

33:24.086 --> 33:25.546
But not you?
No.

33:26.964 --> 33:28.466
I fear no man.

33:30.551 --> 33:31.969
No matter how wicked.

33:34.055 --> 33:36.015
People tell stories
about other people.

33:36.098 --> 33:37.558
People they don't know.

33:37.808 --> 33:38.893
Have never met.

33:39.852 --> 33:43.564
And yet they still curse them
and tell lies about them.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.526
Isn't that true?
Yes.

33:48.402 --> 33:50.488
People tell lies
about our savior.

33:51.030 --> 33:53.824
Well, perhaps they tell lies
about me as well.

33:57.245 --> 33:58.663
How would I know?

34:08.506 --> 34:11.217
I will give you
the chance to find out.

34:12.802 --> 34:15.012
You are coming
on a journey with us.

34:23.980 --> 34:26.399
I am already on a journey.

34:28.859 --> 34:29.986
Aren't we all?

34:41.497 --> 34:42.498
Halfdan.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.001
I know.

34:45.293 --> 34:46.294
I can hear.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.268
What has happened?

35:04.020 --> 35:05.771
From what I can gather,
Commander Euphemius

35:05.855 --> 35:10.860
was placed under arrest
last night but somehow
managed to escape.

35:12.028 --> 35:13.487
And it was their fault?

35:14.864 --> 35:15.865
Yes.

36:04.997 --> 36:08.125
We haven't exactly been
the best bodyguards, have we?

36:09.293 --> 36:11.379
No, we have not.

36:34.985 --> 36:36.946
What do you want, Ubbe?

36:38.489 --> 36:39.490
Me?

36:40.991 --> 36:42.159
I don't want anything.

36:45.037 --> 36:46.038
I'm just curious.

36:47.498 --> 36:49.750
Like my father, I suppose.
He was curious, no?

36:50.960 --> 36:51.961
I know.

36:54.797 --> 36:57.258
Since you were so good to Ivar
when he was younger,

36:59.343 --> 37:02.888
you should know
that he and I have fallen out.

37:10.104 --> 37:11.689
Can you not be reconciled?

37:12.523 --> 37:13.524
I don't think so.

37:14.442 --> 37:18.112
I think it is more likely
that one day we will
go to war against each other.

37:23.159 --> 37:24.410
I feel the pity.

37:26.871 --> 37:30.082
But also the relief that
I won't have to choose
between you,

37:30.875 --> 37:35.212
nor suffer grief or joy,

37:35.296 --> 37:37.006
which, in the end,
are the same thing.

37:44.096 --> 37:45.097
Tell me the truth.

37:45.681 --> 37:47.975
Do you really believe
you have found the land
of the gods?

37:51.270 --> 37:52.855
Why would I lie to you, Ubbe?

37:53.564 --> 37:54.773
Because you're insane.

37:58.235 --> 37:59.236
Am I?

38:39.401 --> 38:40.402
Please.

38:47.660 --> 38:51.622
This feast is to celebrate
our trade agreement

38:51.914 --> 38:53.874
and our
continuing cooperation.

38:54.959 --> 38:59.964
In return for furs, swords,
birds of prey, and slaves,

39:00.839 --> 39:04.426
we are going to give you
gold ornaments,
silver ornaments,

39:04.677 --> 39:07.096
pepper, saffron, and silk.

39:07.888 --> 39:11.475
As you can see,
these local spicy
and exotic dishes

39:11.850 --> 39:15.771
have been especially
prepared for you
by my famous chefs.

39:16.105 --> 39:19.400
They will be insulted
if you don't eat your fill.

39:25.739 --> 39:26.740
Please.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.546
Mmm. It's good.

40:17.624 --> 40:18.625
What is he saying?

40:19.168 --> 40:22.171
He's saying that
we've all just eaten
Commander Euphemius.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.300
You see, I discovered

40:26.383 --> 40:29.470
that Euphemius was trying
to double-cross me,

40:29.553 --> 40:31.930
and return
to the Emperor's favor.

40:32.473 --> 40:35.100
Now, that was unacceptable.

40:37.770 --> 40:42.316
And, in any case,
I no longer need
a puppet ruler

40:43.025 --> 40:46.737
since I intend
to capture Sicily myself.

41:01.919 --> 41:03.879
I think we should
return to the boats.

41:04.254 --> 41:05.798
We are in the greatest danger.

41:08.092 --> 41:10.219
Ziyadat Allah?
No.

41:11.011 --> 41:12.012
Kassia.

41:13.263 --> 41:14.723
Didn't you realize?

41:53.470 --> 41:55.180
Here are the Chosen Ones.

42:12.489 --> 42:13.490
Eyvind.

42:28.338 --> 42:29.965
Ketill Flatnose.

42:36.847 --> 42:39.933
And your daughter, Aud.

42:51.028 --> 42:52.029
And you, Guthrum.

43:07.878 --> 43:09.296
You four will be responsible

43:09.379 --> 43:11.632
for preparing
all the families
for the voyage.

43:12.633 --> 43:15.677
But do it carefully
and with utter secrecy.

43:16.720 --> 43:17.721
Tell no one else.

43:22.559 --> 43:24.228
I must disappear
from Kattegat.

43:25.729 --> 43:28.565
I shall go back
to my boat yard
and prepare the boats.

43:29.066 --> 43:31.860
You'll all meet me there
in nine days' time.

43:32.819 --> 43:33.820
Travel separately,

43:34.488 --> 43:36.573
and don't give any indication
that you're leaving.

43:36.823 --> 43:38.408
We shall do as you say, Floki.

43:39.034 --> 43:40.035
We are eager to go.

43:40.786 --> 43:43.247
But I have to say,
the risks are high.

43:43.580 --> 43:46.458
Nothing can be achieved
without taking risks.

43:47.376 --> 43:48.377
That is true.

43:48.961 --> 43:49.962
But remember

43:50.712 --> 43:52.339
what we have been promised.

43:52.756 --> 43:56.843
The gods will take care of us,
since we're doing all this
in their name.

43:58.470 --> 43:59.471
Now, I must go.

44:00.180 --> 44:01.181
Farewell.

44:03.517 --> 44:04.518
For now.

44:25.247 --> 44:28.542
Lord, unto Thee
do I lift up my soul.

44:31.962 --> 44:33.463
There. Turn it around!

44:33.547 --> 44:37.426
Let me not be ashamed,
let not mine enemies
triumph over me.

44:41.430 --> 44:43.932
So, is this an interruption
of your journey?

44:48.478 --> 44:50.063
Or is it a part of it?

44:52.107 --> 44:54.693
What do you think,
Bishop Heahmund?

45:43.116 --> 45:44.117
What are we going to do?

46:36.878 --> 46:39.089
Bjorn, there's a storm coming.

46:39.381 --> 46:40.382
A storm?

46:42.801 --> 46:47.389
If we can stay alive
a few moments longer, maybe...

47:04.156 --> 47:05.157
Too late.
