00:16.057 --> 00:18.101


00:28.611 --> 00:30.739
Hello, Director.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.449
You're looking well.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.535
<i>I am not well at all, Nowhere!</i>

00:35.618 --> 00:38.913
<i>If I were at the airport,</i>
<i>I would be checking two extra bags!</i>

00:40.915 --> 00:43.209
B-Because he has bags under his eyes!

00:43.293 --> 00:45.879
He has such a great sense of humor!

00:45.962 --> 00:50.341
<i>I've been up for 48 hours and counting,</i>
<i>trying to clean up your mess!</i>

00:50.425 --> 00:52.010
<i>You lost a child!</i>

00:52.093 --> 00:55.138
He's really more of a teenager.

00:55.221 --> 01:00.894
Frostee is working to track the
GPS on Cisco's spy watch as we speak.

01:00.977 --> 01:05.774
<i>You and your team have also</i>
<i>thrown all of Europe into disarray!</i>

01:05.857 --> 01:10.779
With respect sir, "all of Europe"
sounds like a bit of an exaggeration.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.865
-Really?

01:13.948 --> 01:16.284
<i>All of Europe</i>
<i>is in disarray due to</i>

01:16.367 --> 01:18.620
<i>a series of mysterious</i>
<i>and destructive attacks!</i>

01:18.703 --> 01:21.039
<i>First, there was a battle</i>
<i>with a truck convoy</i>

01:21.122 --> 01:23.583
<i>on a desert highway in the</i>
<i>Walachian Plain in Romania.</i>

01:25.085 --> 01:26.753


01:27.337 --> 01:31.132
<i>A hiker caught this clip of</i>
<i>two women who were strangely well-prepared</i>

01:31.216 --> 01:33.134
<i>for a surprise avalanche in the Alps.</i>

01:34.677 --> 01:37.222
<i>Then this eccentric woman</i>
<i>scaled a building in Berlin</i>

01:37.305 --> 01:39.724
<i>and fought local law enforcement.</i>

01:39.808 --> 01:41.309


01:41.392 --> 01:42.977


01:51.236 --> 01:53.238
<i>Just yesterday,</i>
<i>a plane landed</i>

01:53.321 --> 01:55.990
<i>in the midst of a road battle</i>
<i>on the Autobahn near Leipzig.</i>

02:00.954 --> 02:01.955


02:06.751 --> 02:08.670
-

02:11.005 --> 02:12.257
Ooh.

02:12.841 --> 02:16.302
<i>An international group</i>
<i>of super-fans called "The Lugnuts Nuts"</i>

02:16.386 --> 02:20.723
<i>have linked this man to a music</i>
<i>video that swept the internet last year.</i>

02:21.307 --> 02:23.560
Aw, lugnuts! My car!

02:24.394 --> 02:27.856
Everyone in Europe now
knows the identity of your "secret" unit.

02:27.939 --> 02:30.650
Your cover is blown and
your team is out of control!

02:30.733 --> 02:33.903
<i>You and your team</i>
<i>are fired, Nowhere!</i>

02:39.159 --> 02:43.163
Sir, please, just give us 48 more hours.

02:43.246 --> 02:46.624
We managed to capture members of
the organization that stole our weapons.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.209
We'll pump them for information

02:48.293 --> 02:51.337
and get to the bottom
of the Incineration Day theft.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.549
We already have the men here.
No publicized destruction.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.342
One last chance, I…

02:56.426 --> 02:58.511
I promise to make it worth your while.

02:59.470 --> 03:04.017
I'll give you 24 hours, Nowhere.
Clock's ticking.

03:05.226 --> 03:06.644
Seems like that went well.

03:06.728 --> 03:07.562
For real.

03:07.645 --> 03:10.273
Silencio! We need to
question those henchmen

03:10.356 --> 03:15.028
and figure out our next move to
take down those Incineration Day thieves!

03:15.111 --> 03:17.989
Our next move should be
finding and saving Cisco!

03:18.072 --> 03:20.450
H-Have you managed to locate
his spy watch, Frostee?

03:20.533 --> 03:23.036
Nope. They must have taken it off of him.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.829
I really hope he's okay.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.623
He just, he runs so scared,

03:26.706 --> 03:29.500
and I can't imagine
how he must be feeling right now.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.381
Where are we?

03:35.465 --> 03:38.509
In the last room
you're ever going to see.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.721
You'll be waiting in here
until we blow this whole place.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.682
So if you got any last words,
now's the time.

03:46.726 --> 03:49.604
Alright,
before I go to the next world,

03:49.687 --> 03:53.107
there is one thing that
I must pass on from this one.

03:53.775 --> 03:58.321
It's a tale of love and loss,

03:59.072 --> 04:00.323
bravery,

04:00.990 --> 04:02.450
and loyalty,

04:02.533 --> 04:06.871
adventure and laughter.

04:07.413 --> 04:13.044
Listen closely, my friends,
to the story of Donut,

04:13.127 --> 04:18.424
the monkey that saved Rio
and won the heart of a nation!

04:20.760 --> 04:22.971
Well? What happens next?

04:25.807 --> 04:29.978
EMP cuffs.
Your suit is completely powerless.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.897
Now start answering questions.
Who do you work for?

04:33.439 --> 04:36.651
You're gonna get nothing from me,
'cause I don't know nothing.

04:36.734 --> 04:39.696
Somebody has to pay you.
Where does the money come from?

04:39.779 --> 04:42.532
No idea. We get paid
through an anonymous account.

04:42.615 --> 04:46.411
Doesn't matter to us where the cash
comes from, long as the checks clear.

04:46.494 --> 04:49.622
You used to work for Sudarikov.
Then what happened?

04:49.706 --> 04:52.917
Once he got locked up,
someone contacted me on the dark web.

04:53.584 --> 04:57.130
I don't ask questions.
But sometimes, I wonder…

04:57.213 --> 05:01.759
Was Sudarikov really the kingpin?
Or was it the owl?

05:02.260 --> 05:07.056
We've been at this for hours
and we're no closer to finding Cisco.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.725
Ms. Nowhere, you have a call.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.226
It's about Cisco.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.812
I have your spy racer.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.815
<i>Before we go any further,</i>
<i>I need proof of life.</i>

05:17.066 --> 05:20.778
-Donut, you spit that spork out right now!

05:21.446 --> 05:25.033
Donut!
I'm worried about you!

05:25.908 --> 05:28.244
Cisco's alive and doing theater.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.287
-Yes!

05:29.370 --> 05:32.790
I'm willing to make an exchange:
your agent for my men.

05:33.374 --> 05:34.500
I need an answer now.

05:35.376 --> 05:36.252
You're on.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.421
Good. Sending coordinates.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.676
Hold up. You agreed to their terms,
just like that?

05:44.343 --> 05:46.804
These coordinates are
located in the Arctic Circle.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.891
Why does everybody seem to have
a nefarious base up there?

05:49.974 --> 05:51.726
We already shut down one with rockets.

05:51.809 --> 05:55.146
Maybe because there's nobody nearby
to see the bad stuff they're doing?

05:55.730 --> 05:59.233
And in terms of square footage, I'm sure
you get a lot of bang for your buck.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.904
You might not be able to heat
your granny unit, but you'll have one!

06:02.987 --> 06:06.908
Gary, you and Julius grab the prisoners
and get them ready to travel.

06:06.991 --> 06:08.242
Let's get to the plane.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.536
We're not seriously
going up there, are we?

06:11.454 --> 06:13.664
What are you talking about?
We have to get Cisco.

06:13.748 --> 06:16.250
Of course we do, but not like this.

06:16.334 --> 06:19.629
We only have 19 hours left
to catch this maniac

06:19.712 --> 06:21.339
before the Director shuts us down!

06:21.923 --> 06:23.382
You don't think they know that?

06:23.466 --> 06:25.760
They've been
five steps ahead of us the whole time!

06:25.843 --> 06:28.554
They know we're desperate.
It's clearly a trap!

06:29.138 --> 06:31.974
But what are we supposed to do, Echo?
We don't have a choice.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.602
We could get some satellite feeds
of the location,

06:34.685 --> 06:36.687
see what's up there,
plan a counterassault…

06:36.771 --> 06:39.816
We can do all that on the way.
Now, let's move!

06:39.899 --> 06:44.320
This is why we study chess at the academy,
to learn to think ahead.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.447
Right now,
we're not seeing the whole board.

06:46.531 --> 06:49.742
Echo, we've done this before!
We'll figure it out when we get there!

06:49.826 --> 06:54.330
That's what they're counting on:
us doing the same thing we always do!

06:54.413 --> 06:55.581
We have to save Cisco!

06:55.665 --> 06:57.625
We don't know if he's actually there!

06:57.708 --> 07:00.461
And even if he is,
we might be putting him in more danger

07:00.545 --> 07:03.422
by showing up without knowing
what we're walking into!

07:03.506 --> 07:04.882
I'm not going.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.884
So what, so you're giving up on family?

07:06.968 --> 07:08.636
That's not what I said!

07:08.719 --> 07:11.931
Well that's what it sounds like
you're saying, okay? We need you, Echo!

07:12.014 --> 07:14.142
You need to listen to me.

07:14.225 --> 07:17.353
You can stay if you want.
But I'm not leaving Cisco behind.

07:21.107 --> 07:24.819
You know Cisco's only up there because
he jumped in that plane to save you.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.028
Think about that.

07:32.493 --> 07:37.248
Once I explode my
mind-control formula, ka-ka-boom-boom!

07:37.331 --> 07:41.878
It will take control of Rio,
and it's tchau, uggos!

07:41.961 --> 07:43.880
What are we gonna do?

07:43.963 --> 07:45.673
I got your back, dawg!

07:45.756 --> 07:48.176
Echo! You came to save me!

07:51.679 --> 07:54.932
And Donut!
What's that you're carrying?

07:58.978 --> 08:02.857
The infinity banana?
But I thought that was just a myth!

08:02.940 --> 08:06.611
<i>Attention:</i>
<i>all personnel begin evacuation protocol</i>

08:06.694 --> 08:08.154
<i>for base-wide detonation.</i>

08:09.655 --> 08:12.700
<i>I know.</i>
<i>Don't make me the bad guy.</i>

08:13.326 --> 08:15.036
Wait, what base-wide detonation?

08:15.119 --> 08:18.915
Of course we have to
evacuate during an awesome show.

08:18.998 --> 08:19.874
Skip to the end!

08:20.458 --> 08:23.252
-Uh, o-okay, all right. Uh…

08:23.336 --> 08:28.299
Don't say goodbye, Donut.
Just say… see you soon!

08:31.177 --> 08:33.095
<i>Look alive, we're landing.</i>

08:37.016 --> 08:41.729
Yikes. I bet they're keeping
the Incineration Day tech in those pods!

08:41.812 --> 08:43.773
But what are they planning to do with it?

08:43.856 --> 08:46.526
That's what we're gonna find out
as soon as we save Cisco.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.444
And Echo thought we shouldn't come here…

08:49.028 --> 08:51.948
<i>Land at the exact coordinates</i>
<i>outside the perimeter.</i>

08:52.031 --> 08:54.242
Cool your laser jets. I'm working on it.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.312
We'll release
our prisoners on three.

09:24.063 --> 09:24.897
One…

09:26.023 --> 09:27.149
Two…

09:28.025 --> 09:29.402
-Three!

09:43.165 --> 09:44.083
Guys, look!

10:03.144 --> 10:05.021
They made their move. Now, Frostee!

10:17.116 --> 10:18.200
Deploying!

10:39.305 --> 10:41.766
-Laser fence, baby!

10:41.849 --> 10:43.684
Yeah, Frostee!

10:43.768 --> 10:44.602
Ha!

10:44.685 --> 10:49.482
How's it feel to get played?

10:49.565 --> 10:54.737
We're about to storm this base,
save Cisco and recover my agency's tech!

11:06.040 --> 11:12.505
I've been waiting for the perfect occasion
to use this indestructible tank,

11:12.588 --> 11:14.173
and now…

11:22.264 --> 11:25.059
So it wasn't indestructible.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.441
Another one of your toys, up in flames.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.318
So careless, Nowhere.

11:35.569 --> 11:39.281
Who are you?
You one of Big Bob Chinatown's operatives?

11:39.365 --> 11:42.701
You don't remember me?
We used to work together.

11:43.327 --> 11:45.329
I'm called… Dann.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.749
What, are you some tech nerd gone rogue?

11:48.833 --> 11:50.251
Something like that.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.424
-Whoa.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.977
-Where's Cisco?
-Trapped on the polar ice cap.

12:08.561 --> 12:12.523
Just like you and the rest of
your weapons and precious technology.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.733
Well, almost all of it.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.569
What are you going to do with it?

12:16.652 --> 12:18.696
Now that it's brought us together?

12:18.779 --> 12:21.240
In ten minutes I'm going to destroy it,

12:21.323 --> 12:24.577
along with your friend
and everything you see here.

12:24.660 --> 12:29.123
But unfortunately, your story must end
before that new chapter begins.

12:35.754 --> 12:38.215
-It's gonna blow!
-No!

12:55.858 --> 12:56.817
What the…?

12:58.736 --> 13:01.739
Told you it was a trap.

13:01.822 --> 13:02.948
Echo!

13:03.532 --> 13:04.950
Comin' in clutch!

13:05.034 --> 13:08.204
I knew
you'd never leave family behind!

13:12.541 --> 13:15.044
She really is the best.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.921
Take them out!

13:24.678 --> 13:25.721
Let's go find Cisco!

13:31.894 --> 13:33.229
Head for the wall!

13:33.896 --> 13:36.482
We're going to bust through
and storm that base!

13:37.149 --> 13:39.777
We have nine minutes
before the base blows up!

13:39.860 --> 13:42.905
-Gary! Julius! What's your ETA?
-<i>Two minutes out.</i>

13:42.988 --> 13:46.075
-We'll meet you there.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.827
I want all forces defending the wall, now!

14:05.844 --> 14:07.805
Hey, I'm sorry I ever doubted you, Echo.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.890
I should have known
you wouldn't let us down.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.184
You know how I feel about family, and…

14:15.354 --> 14:16.438
Whoa!

14:19.358 --> 14:22.653
How about we talk feelings
after we survive this and save Cisco?

14:22.736 --> 14:24.196
Okay, let's catch up later.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.286
I'm totally boxed in!

14:37.668 --> 14:39.920
-It's actually just one guy!

14:54.727 --> 14:59.356
Ha-ha! Ooh! That was an icy one, huh?

14:59.440 --> 15:02.776
Never challenge Frostee
to a frosty battle!

15:04.904 --> 15:06.906
No! No, don't come up here!

15:06.989 --> 15:09.408
Get off me! Let go!

15:15.080 --> 15:16.498
Get off!

15:19.668 --> 15:22.254
Flying's easy. Landing's hard!

15:24.381 --> 15:27.593
-Whoa.

15:29.386 --> 15:33.724
-Everything okay back there?
-Yeah, I got it under control.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.068
Ouch! Looks like that hurt.

15:44.151 --> 15:46.487
<i>Ms. Nowhere,</i>
<i>we're getting close to the wall!</i>

15:46.570 --> 15:49.573
-She's a little busy right now.

15:49.657 --> 15:50.741
Uh-oh.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.081
We're down to six minutes!

15:57.164 --> 15:58.374
I'm calling us a ride.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.300
Gary, Julius,
where are you and the hauler?

16:11.804 --> 16:15.891
Approaching.
There is a lot of ice down here.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.394
<i>Okay, keep go-- </i>

16:18.477 --> 16:20.604
Kinda glad we're down here, Gare.

16:35.411 --> 16:38.163
-Suit not working?

16:41.834 --> 16:43.669
<i>Nowhere, get ready to jump!</i>

17:05.190 --> 17:08.610
-Hey, hands off the wheel!

17:17.286 --> 17:18.829
-Uh-oh.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.376
You're really killing it today!

17:30.799 --> 17:31.842
Need a ride?

17:40.517 --> 17:41.518
Hop on.

17:45.189 --> 17:48.609
-Four minutes until the base explodes!

17:49.651 --> 17:51.862
<i>We're ready to take down that wall!</i>

18:00.704 --> 18:02.915
Firing laser cannons!

18:10.047 --> 18:11.215
Firing rockets!

18:23.185 --> 18:25.395
And the wall comes tumbling down!

18:35.239 --> 18:37.199
Should we try again?

18:37.282 --> 18:40.994
-How are we gonna get in?
-If we can't go through, we'll go over.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.594
I've always wanted to use these.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.433
Whoo! That's what I'm talking about!

19:10.983 --> 19:12.734
-Kinda crowded on here.

19:27.749 --> 19:29.251
Not everyone is out.

19:29.334 --> 19:32.129
Should we blow up the base
with Nowhere's crew inside?

19:32.212 --> 19:34.882
No. I have a better idea.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.717
Men, stand down!

19:40.387 --> 19:42.848
Uh, why aren't they attacking anymore?

19:42.931 --> 19:44.433
They must all be evacuating.

19:44.516 --> 19:47.895
Only two minutes left!
Running a body heat scan of the base now.

19:52.232 --> 19:55.986
Oh!
There those lovable pit stains are!

19:56.069 --> 19:56.945
Follow me!

20:06.580 --> 20:07.414
He's in here!

20:12.961 --> 20:14.880
Oh, it's so good to see you!

20:14.963 --> 20:17.007
You too!

20:17.090 --> 20:19.801
But it's a swamp in here, man.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.678
Oh. Yeah, sorry.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.013
I knew you'd come!

20:23.096 --> 20:26.767
There's a detonator in the next cell over,
and I'm trapped in these things!

20:27.351 --> 20:30.938
That's the main problem
with the Anti-Anti-Gravity Boots.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.983
-Let's get the heck out of here!

20:35.067 --> 20:37.319
Negative. We need to finish the mission.

20:37.402 --> 20:40.239
All of our jobs are at stake,
especially mine!

20:40.322 --> 20:41.406
Lead the way, Cisco!

20:45.744 --> 20:48.956
-
-This detonator is from the agency!

20:49.539 --> 20:51.124
My disarming code should work.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.547
Dang, that's a long code.

20:57.631 --> 21:01.301
And unlike someone,
I always remember the whole thing!

21:01.885 --> 21:04.054
Oh no, I forgot the last number!

21:04.137 --> 21:07.766
Or maybe I mixed it up
with the first number!

21:07.849 --> 21:09.685
Oh. Uh…

21:10.269 --> 21:12.688
Uh, I'm actually confused.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.856
-Is it three or seven?

21:14.940 --> 21:16.858
-Gary!
-It's not my code.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.026
I vote three!

21:18.110 --> 21:20.237
Just enter it! We don't have time!

21:38.588 --> 21:41.967
-Yes! See, I knew it was three!

21:42.050 --> 21:44.720
-We did it!

21:44.803 --> 21:47.139
Thanks for
your agency code, Nowhere.

21:50.892 --> 21:53.603
At first,
I was just going to take you out.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.106
But when you got past my defenses,

21:56.189 --> 22:00.902
I realized I could get you to give me
the key to all your agency's resources,

22:00.986 --> 22:02.904
then take you out.

22:03.488 --> 22:04.865
I can't believe it.

22:04.948 --> 22:08.994
Yeah. The playa just got played. Again!

22:36.354 --> 22:39.107
