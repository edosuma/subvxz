WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:03.704
(Italian folk music playing)

00:10.210 --> 00:11.745
Look, I'm not going
to Italy. Okay?

00:11.745 --> 00:13.547
The job there
no longer exists.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.016
(giggling)

00:17.017 --> 00:18.418
(laughing)

00:18.418 --> 00:20.654
(all laughing)

00:20.654 --> 00:22.589
(laughter echoing)

00:26.693 --> 00:31.064
(Audrey reading in Italian)

00:32.232 --> 00:34.334
-No...
-(water sloshing)

00:34.334 --> 00:37.070
(Audrey continuing in Italian)

00:37.070 --> 00:39.239
No... No.

00:39.239 --> 00:41.975
(speaking Italian)

00:41.975 --> 00:44.278
No!

00:44.278 --> 00:46.146
-Sound off!
-Happy!

00:46.146 --> 00:47.714
-Sound off!
-Birthday!

00:47.714 --> 00:50.450
Both:
Happy birthday, Kevin!

00:50.450 --> 00:52.519
-Here.
-No. Thank you.

00:52.519 --> 00:54.755
Hurry up, before the wax
starts dripping on you and
it gets all kinky up in here.

00:57.090 --> 00:59.226
-(hoots)
-Yay! Happy birthday, Kev.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.194
Okay, down these.
You're gonna need
a good stomach coating

01:01.194 --> 01:04.031
-for the direction
we're headed.
-Yeah, guys, I have to work.

01:04.031 --> 01:05.499
Don't you have today off?

01:05.499 --> 01:08.201
No. People work
on their birthdays.

01:08.201 --> 01:09.636
No, they don't.

01:09.636 --> 01:12.306
No. If George Washington was
alive, he wouldn't.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.541
-Or Abraham Lincoln.
-Or Martin Luther King.

01:14.541 --> 01:17.177
Well, sometimes he would,
depending on where he worked.

01:18.712 --> 01:22.115
Yum. Thank you.
Thank you, guys, so much.

01:22.115 --> 01:24.685
I really appreciate this,
but nothing else. Okay?

01:24.685 --> 01:28.522
I just want to put
this year behind me,
celebrate by not celebrating.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.524
Nobody at the office even knows
it's my birthday today.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.226
All right, Kev.
We totally get it.

01:33.226 --> 01:34.728
No celebrating.
No problem.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.730
It's the last time
we talk about it.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.499
-Thank you.
-Both: Bye!

01:39.499 --> 01:41.101
Okay, here's the thing.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.004
I know my brother better
than he knows himself, right?

01:44.004 --> 01:45.973
And when he says,
he doesn't want to celebrate,

01:45.973 --> 01:48.442
-what he really means...
-Yeah.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.177
-No, he doesn't want to.
-Not at all.

01:50.177 --> 01:52.212
-(theme music playing)

02:09.229 --> 02:10.564
(Audrey clears throat)

02:10.564 --> 02:13.333
Oh. No thanks.
I already had pancakes
this morning.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.135
Wow, fancy.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.104
Nope. No, nothing fancy.

02:17.104 --> 02:20.140
Just regular old pancakes
on a regular old day.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.308
I would hardly call
it regular.

02:21.308 --> 02:24.077
What? Why? Why not?
Why wouldn't you?
You wouldn't? Why?

02:24.077 --> 02:26.546
Because we have to redo
the sales packet

02:26.546 --> 02:29.082
for the Hemet Women's
Correctional Center.

02:29.082 --> 02:32.319
Apparently, some of
the nutritional values
were off.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.421
Oh, man.
That was so much work.

02:34.421 --> 02:38.291
But, you know, nice to see
that the only grams those ladies
are counting now are sugar.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.594
-(both laugh)
-(phone ringing)

02:42.195 --> 02:44.398
Superior Foods and Beverages.
Kevin Daily speaking.

02:44.398 --> 02:47.634
Kevin, Rutgar's not good.
I'm at the hospital.

02:47.634 --> 02:51.171
It might be the end... (coos)
but him's a tough soldier.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.306
Julia, it's Audrey.
I'm so sorry.

02:53.306 --> 02:55.609
Oh, I know,
it's really tough, sweetie.

02:55.609 --> 02:59.346
He's like a little kitten,
a kitten with
incontinence issues.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.581
<i>But I'm not leaving</i>
<i>my furbaby's side.</i>

03:01.581 --> 03:03.383
So, Kevin, you're in charge.

03:03.383 --> 03:07.154
I want you to do
whatever it takes to get
that sales packet in tonight.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.556
-Me? Perfect.
- <i>What was that?</i>

03:09.556 --> 03:12.159
I can't hear you
over all of Rutgy's moaning.

03:12.159 --> 03:14.728
Oh, I just said...
Purrrfect.

03:14.728 --> 03:19.266
Kevin, I need you at your best
today and that joke wasn't it.

03:19.266 --> 03:21.601
-You're right.
<i>-Just be my responsible Kevs.</i>

03:21.601 --> 03:25.338
Clean up any mess
and finish any deal. Okay?

03:25.338 --> 03:27.641
You're my cleaner
and my closer-- my double-C.

03:27.641 --> 03:32.045
-Is there anything
I can do, Julia?
<i>-Just listen to Kevin,</i>

03:32.045 --> 03:34.147
and just pray
that little R-man pulls through.

03:34.147 --> 03:35.649
But I meant
in a leadership role--

03:35.649 --> 03:38.985
<i>You said you'd get me a private!</i>
<i>I want a private room, damn it!</i>

03:38.985 --> 03:40.220
(Rutgar yowls)

03:45.459 --> 03:48.361
Hey, you know, she's just...
she's just going through a lot.

03:48.361 --> 03:50.430
I mean, those kitty moans
were pretty bad.

03:50.430 --> 03:53.266
It's fine. She sees you
as responsible,

03:53.266 --> 03:56.103
and she wants to give you
the opportunity to be in charge.

03:56.103 --> 03:57.404
I don't begrudge you.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.306
Opportunity?
Are you kidding me?

03:59.306 --> 04:01.675
Responsibility is a curse,
especially here.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.344
In charge, just means
you're a referee...

04:04.344 --> 04:06.413
-(muffled grumbling)
-Guys, guys, guys!
Stop fighting!

04:06.413 --> 04:07.714
There is enough
for both of you. Okay?

04:07.714 --> 04:09.983
Just... share the schmear.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.385
<i>...constantly solving</i>
<i>ridiculous problems...</i>

04:12.385 --> 04:14.654
Turn over your staplers
and just read the name tape
on the bottom,

04:14.654 --> 04:16.289
and, uh, see if you have
the right one.

04:16.289 --> 04:19.092
-(whimpers)
-Now, please.
Let's do it now.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.695
<i>-...putting out fires.</i>
-(alarm beeping)

04:27.434 --> 04:29.369
You underestimate them.

04:29.369 --> 04:31.104
I think they are
smart and capable,

04:31.104 --> 04:32.739
it's up to the person
in charge to mold that.

04:32.739 --> 04:34.975
-(scoffs)
-Here.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.277
Maybe this will help
inspire you.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.479
Progressive ideas
I've collected on studies,

04:39.479 --> 04:41.414
business journals,
think tanks--

04:41.414 --> 04:43.383
-Kevin, there is an emergency!
-What? What is it?

04:43.383 --> 04:47.587
Simon says my herbal
lumbar pillow is his.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.757
Oh, this day...

04:50.757 --> 04:53.260
This day will be
an endless day in hell.

04:56.396 --> 05:01.101
So with Julia unable to leave
her... relative's side today,

05:01.101 --> 05:04.204
it's up to us to redo
the sales packet by
the end of the day.

05:04.204 --> 05:06.239
That means working
through lunch.

05:06.239 --> 05:07.407
-(grumbling)
-I'm sorry.

05:07.407 --> 05:09.509
Okay, Ricky,
you are on soft drinks.

05:09.509 --> 05:12.245
Simon, you are on chips.
Uh, Garfunkle, you--

05:12.245 --> 05:14.681
(sniffs, sighs)

05:14.681 --> 05:17.117
-Nevermind.
-(clears throat)

05:17.117 --> 05:19.319
Whose fault is it
we have to do
the sales packet again?

05:19.319 --> 05:22.422
I spent six hours confirming
that there aren't any nuts
in the smoothies

05:22.422 --> 05:24.324
and I don't plan
on doing it again.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.159
There was some rat hair, though.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.229
Ricky, it's not any one
individual who's at fault. Okay?

05:29.229 --> 05:31.665
We just need you
to finish collecting
the beverage data.

05:31.665 --> 05:35.202
Just... don't worry about
anything other than that.
Okay? Everybody, good?

05:35.202 --> 05:38.605
Let's do it, people.
Good stuff.

05:38.605 --> 05:42.075
Wow, did you ever miss
an opportunity for dialoguing.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.177
-But, you know, whatever,
you're in charge.
-No dialoguing.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.646
Trust me,
the more that you give them,
the more that they want.

05:46.646 --> 05:48.715
-They're like squirrels.
-What?

05:48.715 --> 05:51.451
You know, when you feed them
like one nut by hand

05:51.451 --> 05:53.720
'cause you think it'll be fun,
but then they just keep
sneaking back--

05:53.720 --> 05:57.457
-You feed squirrels?
-Yeah. No. What? Forget it.

05:57.457 --> 06:00.760
I'm not--
I've done it like four times.
I don't know, it's not a thing.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.362
Okay.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.297
(elevator dings)

06:13.206 --> 06:16.076
Patti! What are
you doing here?
Out shopping?

06:16.076 --> 06:18.411
Yeah. It was
either Rodeo Drive

06:18.411 --> 06:20.680
or this depressing
cinder-block building.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.316
(laughs) No. Since
my daddy dates your boss,

06:23.316 --> 06:25.385
he arranged for me
to come and work here
to see if I like it.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.654
Who's your daddy?

06:29.256 --> 06:32.025
Our night of passion is
long forgotten.
Please move on.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.361
Anyhow, my dad thinks
that running a blog

06:34.361 --> 06:37.998
about how your dad is
on you to get a real job
isn't a real job.

06:37.998 --> 06:41.601
Julia's actually out right now,
but if you're serious
about working,

06:41.601 --> 06:43.370
you know,
we could probably use the help.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.572
You can be our Superior Foods
and Beverages intern.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.108
Well, the superior part works.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.110
Okay, where's your kitchen?

06:50.110 --> 06:52.445
I need a snack
to recharge after my drive.

06:52.445 --> 06:55.482
I had a very stressful
Uber experience.

06:55.482 --> 06:58.618
(blowing)

06:58.618 --> 07:01.121
Ugh.

07:01.121 --> 07:04.524
-Okay, so where are the snacks?
-I'll show you. I'm Ricky.

07:04.524 --> 07:06.760
You look like
a high-class dominatrix.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.530
I'm Patti.
From this moment forward,
you shall be my work husband.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.432
Accepted.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.239
I'm so glad you heard
Kevin's cry for party help.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.740
I thought I was
the only one.

07:20.740 --> 07:23.510
Roxie, if you weren't
his sister, I'd be like damn,

07:23.510 --> 07:26.012
that girl that looks like him
and has same last name,

07:26.012 --> 07:27.447
knows him just as well as I do.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.450
Oh! We need to make room
for a dance floor.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.719
-But Kevin hates dancing.
-Oh, you're right.

07:32.719 --> 07:35.255
Let me tell you something.
I love it.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.524
-Me too.
-Oh yeah?

07:37.524 --> 07:39.125
We'll see about that.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.661
-(hip-hop music playing)
-How much you like this?

07:41.661 --> 07:43.663
-A lot.
-How much?

07:43.663 --> 07:45.699
-A lot!
-How much?!

07:45.699 --> 07:48.501
-A lot!
-(scatting)

07:52.272 --> 07:54.441
I broke the lamp! Ha!
Oh, I broke the lamp.

07:54.441 --> 07:57.344
Oh, it's fine.
Just leave it. We'll blame it
on the drunkest guest later.

07:57.344 --> 08:00.613
-Wait, that's going to be me.
-You.

08:00.613 --> 08:03.149
-Let's plan this bitch.
-Let's plan it!

08:03.149 --> 08:04.584
(Patti and Ricky laughing)

08:04.584 --> 08:06.419
Patti:
Uh, I thought this was
a food business?

08:06.419 --> 08:09.356
All you guys have to eat are
these multi-grain doorstops.

08:09.356 --> 08:12.592
Patti? Hi. Can I just get you
to look over these papers

08:12.592 --> 08:14.627
from the Hemet Women's
Correctional Center?

08:14.627 --> 08:17.263
I need to know the monthly
number of snacks per inmate.

08:17.263 --> 08:20.166
-I'd say it's 25 to life.
-(laughter)

08:21.668 --> 08:22.669
Okay, people.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.172
I know that it's kind of a drag
to have to do this work

08:26.172 --> 08:27.440
since we've already
all done it once.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.110
But there's really nothing
that we can do. Okay?
So, let's do it.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.546
Mm! Wish you had been
this forceful during
our night together.

08:33.546 --> 08:35.615
What happened to leaving
that behind us?

08:35.615 --> 08:38.985
You embarrassed me by giving me
work and expecting me to do it.

08:38.985 --> 08:41.554
So I retaliated
with that mild emasculation.

08:41.554 --> 08:44.124
-(sing-songy) Ricky?
-Yes, my queen.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.593
-Patti: Come with me.
-Audrey: You'll get more
out of your employees

08:46.593 --> 08:50.130
if you make them feel like their
contributions mold the company.

08:50.130 --> 08:53.700
Hmm. Patti's only contribution
is just being a roving stand-up,

08:53.700 --> 08:57.470
which really isn't molding
anything, you know,
especially with that material.

08:57.470 --> 09:01.341
It's mostly hacky
observational stuff,
but it just seems to kill.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.376
(phone ringing)

09:03.376 --> 09:06.346
Hello? Mrs. Swane.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.314
What? Slow down.

09:08.314 --> 09:11.151
No, no, no. Nope.
Nope, don't call the police.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.752
I'm-- I'll come home
right now,

09:12.752 --> 09:15.288
and I'll just take care
of everything.

09:15.288 --> 09:18.024
I'll see you soon.
Thank you.

09:18.024 --> 09:21.528
Well, I've got to go.
There's a problem
in my apartment, of course.

09:21.528 --> 09:24.464
'Cause it's not enough
that I'm dealing with
all of the problems here.

09:24.464 --> 09:27.667
-Okay.
-But, hey, you wanted to be
in charge. Right?

09:27.667 --> 09:30.303
-So, you got it, sister.
-Really?

09:30.303 --> 09:32.739
I'm gonna be back
as soon as I possibly can.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.508
Yep. Take your time.
My binder and I
got it covered.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.243
Garfunkle:
Give me it!

09:37.243 --> 09:38.645
Already coming in handy.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.748
Audrey:
Okay, everyone.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.349
Everyone? Eyes up here.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.452
-(grumbling)
-Thank you.

09:45.452 --> 09:49.422
I've noticed a lot of grumble
related to today's redo,

09:49.422 --> 09:53.093
and while Kevin had
a "shut up and do it" attitude,

09:53.093 --> 09:56.529
I think you will all
be relieved to know
that I have a "speak up

09:56.529 --> 10:00.633
"and do it if it feels right
for you" attitude.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.635
What are you
talking about?

10:02.635 --> 10:04.504
And have you done anything
about Herbal Pillowgate?

10:04.504 --> 10:06.673
Not just yet.
Right now we're doing this.

10:06.673 --> 10:09.142
-It's a game.
-Hope it's not Pictionary.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.478
I can't draw.
I have two left hands.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.613
No, no.
It's not Pictionary.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.216
It is a game
that increases productivity

10:16.216 --> 10:19.285
and positive
work-related feelings.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.988
-Are there prizes?
-Oh yes!

10:21.988 --> 10:26.392
Whoever answers the questions
will get office bucks,

10:26.392 --> 10:29.462
which you can trade in
for fun opportunities
right here at work.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.997
Uh, is there real money?

10:30.997 --> 10:34.400
No. For example,
ten office bucks

10:34.400 --> 10:37.537
equals one lunch unit,
and if you get five lunch units,

10:37.537 --> 10:40.440
you get to dine in
the conference room!

10:44.277 --> 10:46.613
Let's start with an easy one.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.648
What's my strongest skill?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.650
Ricky, what about you?

10:50.650 --> 10:53.019
I'd say my strongest skill is

10:53.019 --> 10:55.088
not showing how angry
I am right now.

10:55.088 --> 10:59.359
Okay. Anger is an emotion
that once processed,

10:59.359 --> 11:02.495
you'll fully understand
what's really bothering you.

11:02.495 --> 11:05.765
You and Kevin-- for making us do
the work we already did.

11:05.765 --> 11:09.969
But now that he's gone,
just... you.

11:14.707 --> 11:16.676
Ow. I'm sorry,
I thought this was America,

11:16.676 --> 11:19.512
where I can defend myself
in the moment,
if wrongly accused

11:19.512 --> 11:22.015
to the police officer doing
that wrongful accusing,

11:22.015 --> 11:25.185
even if it means using an
endless stream of curse words.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.686
Isn't that right, Kevin?
Tell him.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.622
-No.
-Well, she gets a phone call,
I know that much.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.691
She would just call me
and I'm here.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.194
Brian:
Here, let me see
the cuffs.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.564
So, I see that you're from
the, uh, the 94th precinct.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.599
My company,
Superior Foods and Beverages,

11:39.599 --> 11:42.302
we always stock the stuff
that goes in your vending
machines at that station.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.736
Yeah. What about it?

11:43.736 --> 11:46.539
Well, how are those
"Fit & Slim Choices"
working out for you.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.074
What are you trying to say?

11:48.074 --> 11:51.244
I don't know. Nothing.
I mean...

11:51.244 --> 11:55.014
Well, I do miss
my Fire Hot Crunch-eez.

11:55.014 --> 11:57.684
Of course you do.
A man wants what a man wants.

11:57.684 --> 12:01.354
I could probably get
those things put back
in there for you.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.223
(whispers) Like a tiger.
Like a tiger.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.059
Here's the thing, though.
My buddy and my sister,

12:06.059 --> 12:09.696
they were just trying
to surprise me on my birthday

12:09.696 --> 12:11.464
and they got
a little out of control.

12:11.464 --> 12:15.702
I apologize.
You know the truth is... (sighs)

12:15.702 --> 12:18.338
I didn't even really want
to celebrate this year,
you know.

12:18.338 --> 12:21.107
Yeah, I get it.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.243
Forty was tough on me too.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.744
I'm not...

12:24.744 --> 12:27.113
Yeah, it's been rough.

12:27.113 --> 12:30.016
-(Roxie giggling)
-Okay.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.619
It looks like the problem
is contained now.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.021
Okay!
Thank you!

12:35.021 --> 12:36.990
Oh. Can you write down
your e-mail

12:36.990 --> 12:38.658
in case I want to sue you
for brutality?

12:38.658 --> 12:40.226
I have an entire
cocktail over here

12:40.226 --> 12:42.061
I haven't been able to enjoy
because of all this nonsense.

12:42.061 --> 12:44.497
Okay! Thank you so much.
And, hey, uh,

12:44.497 --> 12:47.233
be on the lookout
for those Fire Hot Crunch-eez.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.068
All right.

12:49.068 --> 12:52.171
-Mm!
-That was
frickin' awesome, Kev.

12:52.171 --> 12:54.274
That was like <i>The Wire</i>
but with snacks.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.409
-Who wants mojitos?
-Oh, those are bad for you.

12:56.409 --> 12:59.279
-And I'm going back to work.
-Brian: You want one, Kev.

13:01.347 --> 13:03.983
-Hey, girl.
-Hey!

13:03.983 --> 13:07.553
So, Patti,
how are you feeling?

13:07.553 --> 13:09.222
You getting
the hang of it here?

13:09.222 --> 13:13.026
Okay, Audrey,
you're my friend,
so I have to tell you.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.361
Everyone's
making fun of you.

13:15.361 --> 13:17.096
Who?

13:17.096 --> 13:19.065
Um...

13:19.065 --> 13:22.602
-And that walk of hers...
-(laughter)

13:22.602 --> 13:24.971
Am I right?

13:24.971 --> 13:29.142
I don't know.
You know I'm still learning
people's names here.

13:29.142 --> 13:33.680
Well, it's probably
because they're just not used
to having someone in charge

13:33.680 --> 13:36.983
who's so approachable and...
and caring.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.318
No, that's not it.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.219
They're all going mad,
stuck in their cages.

13:40.219 --> 13:43.323
Everyone feels like veal,
veal that has to talk
about their feelings.

13:43.323 --> 13:48.294
Okay. That is
excellent feedback.

13:48.294 --> 13:49.996
Thank you.

13:49.996 --> 13:53.766
Hey, hey. Ricky. Ladies.

13:53.766 --> 13:58.004
Okay, everybody,
we are inching our way
toward that finish line.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.639
I don't know how I'm feeling!

13:59.639 --> 14:03.176
And that's okay, Simon,
because we're not going
to talk about that.

14:03.176 --> 14:06.045
In fact, we're not going to be
talking at all.

14:06.045 --> 14:08.481
We are going to take a walk.

14:12.352 --> 14:17.023
A little good old-fashioned
exercise to boost circulation
and brain power.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.459
Let's go. (chuckles)

14:19.459 --> 14:22.228
Three brisks laps
around the building.
What do you say?

14:22.228 --> 14:25.131
Go! Skedaddle!

14:25.131 --> 14:27.266
That's great, guys.

14:27.266 --> 14:28.735
Are you gonna keep
me company?

14:28.735 --> 14:31.404
I'm with you, sister.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.573
(elevator dings)

14:33.573 --> 14:35.541
(sighs)

14:35.541 --> 14:39.579
(cell phones ringing, buzzing)

14:46.085 --> 14:47.587
(scoffs) Please.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.989
I don't know about you, peeps,
but all I see are the words

14:49.989 --> 14:52.759
"drive," "home," and "walk out."

14:52.759 --> 14:56.095
-Who's with me?
-(laughter)

14:56.095 --> 14:58.631
Patti:
Halt! Halt! Halt!

14:58.631 --> 15:00.133
(laughs) Hey.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.970
You guys ever seen
Audrey try and push
an elevator button?

15:03.970 --> 15:06.973
(loud laughter)

15:06.973 --> 15:09.008
(clock ticking)

15:09.008 --> 15:12.211
(phones ringing)

15:16.115 --> 15:19.185
Audrey? Where is everybody?

15:19.185 --> 15:22.655
Oh... gone.
All of them.

15:22.655 --> 15:26.058
And, Kevin, I don't think
they're coming back.

15:26.058 --> 15:29.028
(voice echoing)
Coming back, coming back.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.698
We need them to come back.

15:32.698 --> 15:34.967
Nobody's handed in their numbers
for the new packet yet.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.069
Where are they?

15:37.069 --> 15:39.105
Boosting their brain power.
I let them take a walk.
It was an idea from my binder.

15:39.105 --> 15:42.175
Oh my God!
That's like asking a group
of toddlers to wait

15:42.175 --> 15:44.444
on the end of the pier
while you go get another drink
at the bar!

15:44.444 --> 15:46.379
But you probably knew that
from your babysitting binder.

15:46.379 --> 15:47.747
You leave my binder
out of this.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.115
-(phone ringing)
-Sure thing.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.017
-(groans)
-(phone beeps)

15:51.017 --> 15:54.020
-Hi, Julia. How's our boy?
-Julia: <i>Kevin...</i>

15:54.020 --> 15:56.522
Rutgar turned a corner,
a big one.

15:56.522 --> 15:59.725
Tubes have been removed
and the color's returned
to his whiskers.

15:59.725 --> 16:01.260
Fantastic!

16:01.260 --> 16:02.695
<i>Listen, we're on</i>
<i>our way home,</i>

16:02.695 --> 16:04.230
but I'm gonna stop off
at the office first

16:04.230 --> 16:06.199
<i>to sign off</i>
<i>on the sales packet,</i>

16:06.199 --> 16:08.134
<i>so we can get it</i>
<i>in tonight, all right?</i>

16:08.134 --> 16:11.571
-Terrific! They're so ready
to be gotten in.
<i>-Terrific.</i>

16:11.571 --> 16:14.240
(toy squeaking)

16:14.240 --> 16:15.741
(gasps)

16:15.741 --> 16:19.679
Oh, Rutgar!
Look, my darling, a clown.

16:22.114 --> 16:24.083
-(groans)
-(sighs)

16:24.083 --> 16:26.052
(thumping)

16:26.052 --> 16:27.119
Sorry, Kevin.

16:27.119 --> 16:29.222
I just thought
this was an opportunity

16:29.222 --> 16:30.456
to use some new techniques.

16:30.456 --> 16:32.225
They just want
to put their heads down

16:32.225 --> 16:34.494
and get through the day.
And can you blame them?

16:34.494 --> 16:36.128
I mean, that's all
I wanted to do today.

16:36.128 --> 16:37.230
Why? What's today?

16:37.230 --> 16:38.764
Nothing.

16:38.764 --> 16:40.600
Oh, this is bad.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.368
I know this is my fault,

16:42.368 --> 16:45.037
but I could really use
a cleaner and closer
right about now.

16:45.037 --> 16:46.706
Please, Kevin.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.207
(dramatic music playing)

16:48.207 --> 16:50.042
(birds chirping)

16:55.147 --> 16:56.382
Kevin:
Audrey,

16:56.382 --> 16:59.252
I'd hope not to reveal
this information to you,

16:59.252 --> 17:01.153
as it's been
a pretty rough year.

17:01.153 --> 17:02.321
I remember.

17:02.321 --> 17:05.157
I was going to go to Italy,
but I did not.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.226
I said I remember.

17:07.226 --> 17:09.028
And then, I embarrassed
myself with you...

17:10.596 --> 17:12.365
and I've been struggling
with that ever since.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.101
I felt as though
I had nothing to celebrate,

17:15.101 --> 17:17.670
and so I was determined
to conceal the secret...

17:17.670 --> 17:20.006
until now.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.541
Kevin, what is it?

17:21.541 --> 17:24.176
Julia will be here
any minute with her puss.

17:24.176 --> 17:27.313
There is one thing
that can save you, Audrey.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.115
For today...

17:32.385 --> 17:33.986
Today is my birthday.

17:33.986 --> 17:36.055
It's your birthday?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.224
We must give
them birthday cake.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.425
Mm.

17:39.425 --> 17:41.260
The after-party...

17:41.260 --> 17:43.195
is definitely as amazing
as the party planning.

17:43.195 --> 17:44.430
-Mm-hmm.
-We're good.

17:44.430 --> 17:45.998
So good.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.667
It's too bad we didn't
get to the party-party part.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.734
Mm-hmm.

Audrey:
Hey!

18:50.162 --> 18:52.465
I, uh, saved you the E.

18:52.465 --> 18:56.102
-Ooh.
-Kyle snagged the K, sorry.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.403
Well, you know, he--
he was lured all the way

18:57.403 --> 19:00.439
back from whale watching,
so he deserves a special treat.

19:00.439 --> 19:03.009
-True.
-Employees: Hey!

19:03.009 --> 19:05.111
Kevin:
Welcome back, Julia!

19:05.111 --> 19:07.246
Kevin:
And, Rutgar, look at you!

19:07.246 --> 19:10.016
(chuckles)
Thanks for minding
the store, Kevs.

19:10.016 --> 19:12.251
I almost lost him
to the angels this time.

19:12.251 --> 19:14.286
I am so happy he's okay

19:14.286 --> 19:16.255
-and I missed you! Muah.
-Muah. Muah.

19:16.255 --> 19:18.524
Oh, did you enjoy
working here, doll?

19:18.524 --> 19:20.359
Well, I enjoyed it
when I was outdoors

19:20.359 --> 19:22.128
-when I was supposed
to be working.
-(laughs)

19:22.128 --> 19:24.030
That's okay.
I see you somewhere else

19:24.030 --> 19:25.564
doing something
more creative anyway.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.133
Yes, Fake Mom.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.235
-(laughs)
-(Kevin laughs)

19:29.235 --> 19:30.703
Hey, boy.
Who wants some?

19:30.703 --> 19:32.471
He's diabetic, you dunce!

19:33.706 --> 19:36.375
Mmm. Mmm!

19:37.376 --> 19:39.578
All right, everyone!
Choke down the rest

19:39.578 --> 19:41.247
of your cake
and get back to work!

19:41.247 --> 19:42.648
-Kev?
-Hm?

19:42.648 --> 19:45.217
Drop off that sales packet
when it's ready to sign, okay?

19:45.217 --> 19:46.752
-Kevin: Will do!
-Out of my way, chubs.

19:46.752 --> 19:48.688
(mutters) I can't help it.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.590
Looks like your reign of terror
has come to a merciful end

19:51.590 --> 19:54.293
now that our queen
and her little prince are back.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.162
Long live Julia and Rutgar!

19:56.162 --> 19:57.430
-Hear! Hear!
-(employees cheer)

19:57.430 --> 19:59.999
But between you and me,
I don't think that cat's got

19:59.999 --> 20:02.001
a shot in hell of making it
through the weekend.

20:02.001 --> 20:04.036
(giggles)

20:04.036 --> 20:05.204
(laughs)

20:05.204 --> 20:06.505
So...

20:06.505 --> 20:09.709
why didn't you want anyone
to know about your birthday?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.744
Oh, I don't know.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.714
Um... I guess I just didn't...

20:14.714 --> 20:17.616
want anybody
to feel sorry for me.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.520
It's-- it's been a rough year.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.224
I'm sorry it's been
a disappointment...

20:25.224 --> 20:27.426
in lots of ways.

20:27.426 --> 20:31.997
But it's all over
now, right?

20:31.997 --> 20:34.467
It's a new year and...

20:36.368 --> 20:40.239
this isn't the worst
way to start it, is it?

20:40.239 --> 20:43.042
No, it's not so bad.

20:45.344 --> 20:47.246
Happy birthday, Kevin.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.248
<i>♪ Let your heart run ♪</i>

20:49.248 --> 20:52.184
<i>♪ Let your heart run ♪</i>

20:54.487 --> 20:55.488
(clears throat)

20:57.056 --> 20:58.758
No, don't. You can, um...

20:58.758 --> 21:01.460
feed your squirrels...
with it.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.628
(giggles)

21:03.696 --> 21:05.664
-Never gonna live
that down, huh?
-Audrey: Nope!

21:07.433 --> 21:08.634
I like squirrels.
