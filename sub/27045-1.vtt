01:39.505 --> 01:40.880
What's going on, honey?

01:45.713 --> 01:46.838
Are you OK?

01:49.213 --> 01:50.380
Hanging on...

01:55.672 --> 01:57.922
Let's do this, OK?

01:58.797 --> 01:59.963
Yes.

02:00.755 --> 02:02.672
We're in this together.

02:04.213 --> 02:06.963
- Don't fall apart on me, honey. Please.
- No.

02:07.588 --> 02:08.588
No.

02:11.463 --> 02:12.672
Do it for him.

02:23.047 --> 02:24.255
Let's do this.

02:29.630 --> 02:32.713
- Chin up.
- Yes.

02:46.963 --> 02:48.380
So, parents,

02:48.463 --> 02:52.463
grab your children
and get into the bag with them.

02:52.547 --> 02:57.422
On my signal,
move towards the goal line, me.

02:57.797 --> 03:01.338
So, no cheating.

03:01.422 --> 03:05.922
The first team that makes it
all the way over there, wins.

03:06.005 --> 03:08.713
- Are you guys ready?
- Yeah!

03:08.797 --> 03:11.797
- I can't hear you. Are you ready?
- Yeah!

03:11.880 --> 03:15.838
OK, on your marks...

03:15.922 --> 03:17.880
Ready...

03:20.838 --> 03:25.005
- Come on!
- Go for it!

03:50.588 --> 03:52.255
Hey, Andres.

04:04.588 --> 04:07.588
- Help me.
- Where to?

04:25.297 --> 04:29.422
FIVE YEARS LATER

04:40.838 --> 04:44.005
- Are these yours?
- No, it's that one over there.

04:46.963 --> 04:50.172
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Enjoy your vacation.

04:51.547 --> 04:54.422
- This one's open.
- Enjoy your stay.

04:54.922 --> 04:56.797
- Is it OK?
- Yes.

05:00.172 --> 05:01.547
Thank you. Goodbye.

05:02.005 --> 05:05.797
- You?
- Take this. No, I'll take it.

05:10.755 --> 05:11.880
Nice, isn't it?

05:30.380 --> 05:32.255
- Can you manage?
- Yes.

05:43.588 --> 05:44.838
This place is beautiful.

05:46.630 --> 05:47.963
Great. Isn't it?

05:54.088 --> 05:58.463
- How could you afford this?
- Don't worry, honey.

05:59.005 --> 06:00.672
We're going to enjoy it.

06:04.797 --> 06:06.172
Let's see, Raton.

06:15.255 --> 06:16.547
Look at that.

06:21.880 --> 06:22.880
Do you like it?

06:23.838 --> 06:25.172
It's perfect.

06:56.713 --> 06:59.672
- I have to wake up Pedrito.
- Why?

06:59.755 --> 07:01.380
- I promised him I would.
- No.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.422
- He wanted to go for a swim.
- We'll be here for a week.

07:09.297 --> 07:11.547
- I promised him.
- No.

07:11.630 --> 07:13.088
No. Honey, please. Come on.

07:34.297 --> 07:35.297
Raton.

07:36.547 --> 07:37.963
We're here.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.713
Do you want to go for a swim?

07:42.672 --> 07:43.838
Raton?

07:45.422 --> 07:47.172
Do you want to go in the pool?

07:48.672 --> 07:49.672
Do you?

08:16.338 --> 08:17.422
Mommy.

08:22.255 --> 08:23.422
Mommy.

08:26.755 --> 08:29.463
I don't want to swim
with these shoes anymore.

08:30.047 --> 08:33.255
That's OK, sweetheart. Leave them here.

08:36.712 --> 08:39.462
- What's wrong with his shoes?
- They're uncomfortable.

08:40.255 --> 08:42.255
- Can you touch the bottom?
- Yes.

08:48.797 --> 08:51.422
That's strange. Let's see.

08:53.713 --> 08:55.380
- Is it here?
- Yes.

08:56.338 --> 08:57.588
Good evening.

09:01.338 --> 09:02.672
How can I help you?

09:02.755 --> 09:06.547
We want to know why you won't
let this gentleman into his villa.

09:17.172 --> 09:20.047
I'm sorry. I don't even know these people.

09:20.505 --> 09:22.338
Well, this gentleman has a reservation.

09:22.422 --> 09:25.130
You shouldn't leave them outside
getting bitten by mosquitoes.

09:25.213 --> 09:28.630
Well, I'm very sorry,
but I have a reservation too.

09:28.713 --> 09:31.880
His wife thought someone
had broken into the house.

09:36.422 --> 09:39.797
- Are you calling me a thief?
- No, no, no. It's not that.

09:40.547 --> 09:43.422
It's just that I don't see your papers
and he has his.

09:44.088 --> 09:45.963
My papers are inside, but look...

09:47.422 --> 09:48.422
here's my key.

09:52.088 --> 09:53.588
And here's mine.

09:54.297 --> 09:56.338
Well, that's weird.

09:56.422 --> 09:59.088
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

10:01.088 --> 10:02.297
Is everything OK?

10:02.380 --> 10:05.963
Yes, Mr... What's your name?
Sorry, I didn't hear your name.

10:06.047 --> 10:08.255
Bonilla. Abel Bonilla.

10:08.338 --> 10:10.880
It looks like Mr. Bonilla
has a reservation here as well.

10:10.963 --> 10:12.880
There's obviously some kind of mix-up.

10:13.630 --> 10:16.297
Sorry to bother. But without papers,
one can never be sure.

10:16.880 --> 10:20.172
- But you do have the papers, right?
- Of course. The papers are inside.

10:22.797 --> 10:25.047
So, what should we do now?

10:26.255 --> 10:28.505
Come inside.
There are loads of mosquitoes out here.

10:29.088 --> 10:30.130
We'll solve this.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.755
- We can just make a phone call.
- Yes.

10:39.338 --> 10:42.547
You can leave your luggage here.
It will be fine. No one's stealing it.

10:43.005 --> 10:45.838
Bring your bags in, kids. Excuse me.

10:53.422 --> 10:55.047
How about a shower?

11:00.672 --> 11:02.422
Do you want to stay here with Mommy?

11:03.380 --> 11:06.755
- Is it just him?
- Yes, we only have one.

11:07.213 --> 11:10.630
- How old are you?
- Go on, tell her.

11:11.922 --> 11:15.047
Were you asking me? I'm 30.

11:15.463 --> 11:17.505
You're really pretty.

11:17.588 --> 11:19.713
No one's picking up. What should we do?

11:20.297 --> 11:24.547
I told you, we don't have the authority
to make any decisions.

11:25.380 --> 11:31.505
I see. Well, it's getting pretty late,
so I think we should go to the front desk.

11:32.005 --> 11:34.588
Let's go. I'll be right back, hon.

11:36.505 --> 11:39.797
It won't take long, cutie pie.
Watch the kids.

11:39.880 --> 11:42.005
Excuse us. Good night.

12:49.672 --> 12:50.755
Sir?

12:52.172 --> 12:54.255
- Sir?
- Yes?

12:55.755 --> 13:00.755
Are you enrolled
in our timeshare information seminar?

13:01.172 --> 13:02.505
Yes. So?

13:04.838 --> 13:06.172
Is there a problem?

13:07.088 --> 13:08.338
You too, sir?

13:09.922 --> 13:11.463
I'll take them to Moises.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.422
Follow me, please.

15:46.838 --> 15:47.880
Ma'am.

16:05.338 --> 16:06.463
Hey, you.

16:16.172 --> 16:19.088
They told us we had to sit by color.

16:20.088 --> 16:22.588
- Who said that?
- The memo.

16:23.547 --> 16:24.922
Who is Memo?

16:26.047 --> 16:28.338
Hi, hello. Good evening.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.463
Good evening.

16:30.755 --> 16:34.838
Crew, this is your captain speaking.

16:36.213 --> 16:38.755
Let's show our new owners

16:39.338 --> 16:45.130
that we take organization seriously
here at Vistamar.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.297
I'm very pleased to inform you

16:48.380 --> 16:52.005
that as of today, we'll be part

16:52.088 --> 16:56.797
of the Everfields
International Resorts family.

16:57.797 --> 16:59.463
From now on,

17:00.130 --> 17:04.505
our mission is to make dreams come true.

17:07.172 --> 17:08.713
Before I move on,

17:09.213 --> 17:13.547
I would like to acknowledge
two very special members of our team,

17:14.338 --> 17:19.380
who have inspired us all
with their positive attitude.

17:19.463 --> 17:24.547
Dear Gloria, Andres, please stand up.

17:27.255 --> 17:31.463
Dear friends, your example...

17:34.172 --> 17:38.672
is an inspiration for our great future.

17:40.130 --> 17:43.213
Please, a round of applause
to Gloria and Andres.

18:15.630 --> 18:18.338
- Our manager will be with you shortly.
- OK.

18:18.422 --> 18:20.255
- Like some water?
- No, it's fine.

18:20.338 --> 18:22.880
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

18:22.963 --> 18:25.963
- Right away.
- Hey, what time is it?

18:27.713 --> 18:30.797
Of course. And I have more.
I'll give them to you in a second.

18:30.880 --> 18:33.255
Good morning, Mr. Alvarez.

18:33.338 --> 18:35.880
Morning? Already? What time is it?

18:36.547 --> 18:42.297
May I offer you my sincere apologies
on behalf of Everfields International

18:42.380 --> 18:46.338
for this shaky start
to your vacation's experience.

18:47.047 --> 18:51.172
From now on, paradise is within reach.

18:52.588 --> 18:54.588
I have no idea what you just said.

18:56.047 --> 18:58.922
Could you fix the problem?
Is he getting his own villa?

18:59.005 --> 19:02.380
Mr. Bonilla is completely satisfied
with our arrangement.

19:02.463 --> 19:03.880
Good, I'm glad to hear it.

19:05.338 --> 19:06.588
I asked for coffee.

19:06.672 --> 19:11.630
Unfortunately, I can't share with you
the terms of Mr. Abel's deal.

19:11.713 --> 19:15.338
- Really? Why?
- It's a matter of confidentiality.

19:15.422 --> 19:20.172
It's fine. I only want to know
how you'll get me the villa I paid for.

19:20.255 --> 19:23.297
We know that our customers use their rooms

19:23.380 --> 19:27.338
almost exclusively for sleeping.

19:27.422 --> 19:31.088
And your villa can fit two families.

19:31.672 --> 19:34.505
Well, I don't care if it fits 50 families.

19:34.588 --> 19:38.422
I paid for a private villa for my family.

19:38.505 --> 19:39.922
Do you have a napkin?

19:40.005 --> 19:44.588
Look, mister. I'm really tired.
My flight was delayed two hours.

19:45.047 --> 19:47.172
The trip from the airport was exhausting.

19:47.505 --> 19:51.880
I want you to tell me what you'll do
to get me the villa I paid for.

19:51.963 --> 19:55.255
The villa was practically free
thanks to our generous offer...

19:55.338 --> 19:59.213
So what? Does that make me
a second-class customer?

19:59.672 --> 20:05.338
Absolutely not, Mr. Alvarez.
You deserve an international experience.

20:05.422 --> 20:08.672
Unfortunately,
we don't have any vacancies.

20:08.755 --> 20:13.422
- Why?
- Because our offer was a great success.

20:16.505 --> 20:18.797
You overbooked your rooms, Moises.

20:19.963 --> 20:23.547
- That's illegal.
- It isn't if it's the result of success.

20:24.547 --> 20:29.255
And him? What did you offer him
that made him so happy?

20:30.297 --> 20:31.713
Paradise.

20:32.672 --> 20:34.880
Are you making fun of me?

20:34.963 --> 20:37.963
Do I look stupid to you?
Do I look like I'm in paradise?

20:38.047 --> 20:39.922
- Are you making fun of me?
- Absolutely not...

20:40.005 --> 20:45.422
- Stop goofing around and solve this!
- Mr. Alvarez, please. Show him.

20:49.088 --> 20:50.172
What's that?

20:50.255 --> 20:53.755
An agreement.
You can trust us as if we were family.

21:03.255 --> 21:06.713
This has to be a joke. It can't be.

21:07.213 --> 21:08.797
Look, I only get one week off a year

21:08.880 --> 21:12.422
and you don't know
how important this is to my family.

21:13.130 --> 21:15.463
I want to have the vacation
I paid for today.

21:15.547 --> 21:18.547
And I'm not signing anything that lets you
off the hook from your mistake.

21:18.630 --> 21:21.505
Nor anything that won't guarantee
my family's privacy.

21:21.838 --> 21:26.338
May I offer you my sincere apologies
on behalf of Everfields International.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.422
- Eva, what happened?
- You startled me!

21:41.505 --> 21:44.297
What happened with the room?
Why are they sleeping there?

21:45.005 --> 21:46.797
Can I make myself a cup of coffee?

22:06.297 --> 22:08.630
I'll try to find instant coffee.

22:10.088 --> 22:11.088
OK.

22:12.838 --> 22:15.088
So, what happened with the room?

22:19.088 --> 22:22.838
I don't know. What can I say?
I felt bad. There's four of them.

22:22.922 --> 22:25.172
Their kids wouldn't fit on the sofa bed.

22:25.422 --> 22:28.630
- Besides, it's just for one night.
- No, it's not only for a night.

22:28.713 --> 22:30.547
- What do you mean?
- They're staying here.

22:33.463 --> 22:36.547
They overbooked the villa
and they don't care that it's illegal.

22:39.463 --> 22:40.463
We have to share.

22:47.672 --> 22:50.047
- Want to go to another hotel?
- There's none available.

22:50.130 --> 22:53.630
Everything's full
and what's available is really expensive.

22:54.755 --> 22:56.797
It's the peak of the season.

22:56.880 --> 22:59.130
Besides, why should we leave?
I paid for this.

22:59.213 --> 23:02.005
It is paid for. I have already paid.

23:02.088 --> 23:05.297
There's nothing else. I paid for it.

23:05.380 --> 23:08.588
Honey, it's OK.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.297
We'll just stay all day in the pool.

23:17.338 --> 23:18.338
Yeah.

23:27.297 --> 23:31.463
Thanks for taking it like this.
In your stride.

23:32.422 --> 23:34.547
I would be much worse
if it wasn't for you.

23:34.630 --> 23:38.380
It is what it is. There were nine others
with me at the clinic. You get used to it.

23:41.713 --> 23:44.922
Besides, Raton really likes those kids.
It'll be good for him.

23:45.005 --> 23:46.463
Are you crazy?

23:46.963 --> 23:49.088
We're not spending time with those people.

23:49.172 --> 23:53.338
- They're here.
- And? Raton's IQ will drop.

23:53.422 --> 23:54.880
We'll keep it to the minimum.

24:14.297 --> 24:18.588
All that junk is how they got that idiot
to sign the agreement.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.755
He signed a paper
saying everything was OK

24:21.838 --> 24:23.755
because they gave him that crap.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.880
I'm getting a month for free. You'll see.

24:26.963 --> 24:27.963
How?

24:28.505 --> 24:30.922
- Why are you laughing?
- Why?

24:31.005 --> 24:33.422
- It's not funny.
- Why not?

24:44.463 --> 24:46.463
- Here you go, Sebas.
- Everything OK?

24:46.547 --> 24:47.547
Yes.

24:51.547 --> 24:55.047
Peak season is starting.

24:56.255 --> 24:57.505
You know the saying,

24:58.505 --> 25:02.380
"Never put off till tomorrow
what you can do today."

25:04.380 --> 25:06.463
Forget about "later."

26:17.463 --> 26:18.880
Do you want a balloon, Raton?

26:19.255 --> 26:23.088
- Welcome. Here you are, a balloon.
- Thank you.

26:25.297 --> 26:26.630
Don't let go of it.

26:57.047 --> 26:58.380
Come here, son.

27:01.922 --> 27:05.172
All right, everybody,
follow the instructor!

27:11.588 --> 27:12.588
Shall I tickle you?

27:17.297 --> 27:19.463
Everfields Vistamar!

27:21.797 --> 27:22.797
Turn around.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.172
Ready.

27:30.963 --> 27:32.130
Shall we go dancing?

28:23.047 --> 28:26.088
Very good. Excellent.

30:58.880 --> 31:00.505
What are you doing here, Andres?

31:04.255 --> 31:07.005
This seminar is invitation only.

31:07.088 --> 31:10.297
And you're making this hard for Gloria.

31:12.797 --> 31:16.713
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes, of course.

31:16.797 --> 31:22.005
But there are many reasons
I should be part of this seminar.

31:22.088 --> 31:24.547
I'm a hard worker.

31:25.338 --> 31:29.172
I do my job really well.
I've been employee of the month 14 times...

31:29.255 --> 31:30.922
- Andres.
- I'm a natural leader.

31:31.005 --> 31:33.963
- I do what I'm told.
- I didn't make the call.

31:34.713 --> 31:40.172
Headquarters did. In Tucson, Arizona.

31:40.255 --> 31:43.505
I didn't have anything to do with it.
I barely had a say.

31:51.672 --> 31:54.713
- Excuse me, what's that?
- BBQ ribs, sir.

32:01.672 --> 32:02.963
Want mashed potatoes, Raton?

32:21.963 --> 32:25.255
Buddy! Buddy! We saved you some seats.

32:27.630 --> 32:30.922
- Don't even think about it.
- Honey, they've already seen us.

32:31.005 --> 32:33.922
And there's nowhere else to sit.
Do you want us to eat on our feet?

32:34.755 --> 32:36.547
OK, let's go, then.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.880
- Thank you.
- Good afternoon.

32:45.963 --> 32:47.588
- Hi.
- Did you sleep well?

32:48.172 --> 32:49.755
- Yeah.
- Good.

32:54.088 --> 32:56.448
Didn't know there were waiters.
I thought this was a buffet.

32:57.463 --> 33:01.588
This table is VIP, buddy, VIP.

33:09.838 --> 33:11.547
You guys are really smart.

33:12.255 --> 33:16.713
Look at my little Abelines,
they're all burnt and red.

33:17.422 --> 33:19.088
I burnt my mouth.

33:19.797 --> 33:22.130
I'm gonna have to borrow
that sunscreen, Evis.

33:22.213 --> 33:24.380
Of course, Sara. Whatever you need.

33:24.463 --> 33:26.463
We'll buy one after brunch, cutie pie.

33:27.297 --> 33:28.963
Don't worry about it.

33:30.338 --> 33:34.422
Good afternoon. Are you enjoying
your complimentary brunch?

33:34.505 --> 33:36.088
- Yes!
- Good.

33:36.172 --> 33:40.172
I want you to have a look
at these brochures here.

33:40.255 --> 33:43.047
You can find all our destinations.

33:43.130 --> 33:49.047
The Everfields family has just got bigger,
and we want you to be part of it

33:49.130 --> 33:53.463
so we can provide you with all the health
and well-being you deserve.

33:53.547 --> 33:57.380
We can adapt to any life plan you require.

33:57.755 --> 34:03.422
So rest assured, our main goal
is to share this paradise with you.

34:03.505 --> 34:08.505
So, give it a read,
and I'm here if you have any questions.

34:08.588 --> 34:10.380
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34:10.463 --> 34:12.422
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

34:13.005 --> 34:14.255
Buddy.

34:16.130 --> 34:17.463
I'm fine, thank you.

34:26.588 --> 34:29.047
Eva, you should have some more,
you're so skinny.

34:30.088 --> 34:32.797
Have a steak,
chicken makes you lose weight.

34:32.880 --> 34:35.588
I had a really big breakfast,
so I'm not hungry.

34:36.963 --> 34:40.255
- So, what are you doing this afternoon?
- The kids are going swimming.

34:41.880 --> 34:45.088
- They say there's a beautiful cenote.
- Really?

34:45.172 --> 34:48.255
- We're going. Right, kids?
- Dad, what's that?

34:48.338 --> 34:52.297
A cenote is a small lake
that is inside the cave.

34:53.672 --> 34:56.922
- Can we go to the natural well?
- Do you want to?

34:57.005 --> 35:01.380
I'm not sure, son. It is kind of dangerous
and you're not a strong swimmer yet.

35:01.463 --> 35:04.922
We also have tickets for the water slide.
We can skip the line.

35:06.547 --> 35:10.463
Cenote, cenote, cenote.

35:10.547 --> 35:15.672
Cenote, cenote, cenote.

35:15.755 --> 35:18.630
- Raton! Raton!
- Cenote. Cenote.

35:18.713 --> 35:20.172
Cenote.

35:21.505 --> 35:22.505
Raton!

35:23.838 --> 35:26.463
Raton, stop it!

35:27.380 --> 35:30.130
Calm down, buddy.
We're just playing around.

35:33.630 --> 35:35.047
How are you feeling?

35:36.838 --> 35:37.838
Fine.

35:41.130 --> 35:42.463
Better.

35:44.713 --> 35:48.630
I'm trying to stay positive all the time.

35:52.463 --> 35:55.088
I'm reading one of those books

35:55.172 --> 36:00.838
that help you see things
in a positive light.

36:04.755 --> 36:09.297
I'm trying to do a good job
and set an example.

36:10.297 --> 36:12.880
Especially for our new co-workers.

36:14.880 --> 36:18.422
I'm sure
that I'll be lowering my dose soon.

36:19.755 --> 36:22.213
It is important
that you don't stop your treatment.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.463
How are things at home?

36:25.880 --> 36:26.922
Good.

36:28.713 --> 36:33.713
Gloria, my wife,
well, she's not very expressive.

36:35.755 --> 36:38.630
She is really happy
with the American boss.

36:40.172 --> 36:43.588
How would you say you've performed
since our previous evaluation?

36:45.880 --> 36:47.172
Well, I think...

36:50.463 --> 36:52.797
I'm doing everything I can...

36:53.838 --> 36:56.755
to adjust to all the changes.

36:59.547 --> 37:02.380
I mean, our new bosses.

37:05.213 --> 37:09.047
- Have you had any other visions?
- No.

37:10.547 --> 37:13.505
I think this time,
we found the right combination.

38:03.005 --> 38:04.213
How was your day?

38:06.588 --> 38:07.588
Good.

38:09.422 --> 38:11.088
The seminar is really good.

38:15.713 --> 38:17.422
I'm very tired.

38:19.505 --> 38:21.838
I could really use a vacation.

38:24.630 --> 38:28.755
I'm looking for one
of those "international experiences."

38:33.713 --> 38:37.672
I know someone who's selling them.

38:38.797 --> 38:40.297
She can give me a discount.

38:42.088 --> 38:43.422
Keep dreaming.

38:46.672 --> 38:48.297
It's my opportunity.

38:53.213 --> 38:56.338
- It could be ours.
- Why yours?

38:57.380 --> 38:59.088
What have you done to deserve it?

39:01.047 --> 39:02.380
They owe me.

39:04.880 --> 39:06.672
Nobody owes you anything.

39:07.713 --> 39:09.047
It's a new hotel.

39:10.922 --> 39:12.213
And that is done.

39:14.130 --> 39:16.172
Everfields only cares about the future.

39:16.838 --> 39:18.630
What about our future?

39:21.630 --> 39:23.838
Aren't we a family anymore?

39:29.630 --> 39:32.213
Can't you see that everything has changed?

39:36.338 --> 39:39.630
The hotel has changed.
You have changed and so have I.

39:43.963 --> 39:45.338
He's gone.

39:49.088 --> 39:51.338
If you don't adapt, you'll be left behind.

41:01.630 --> 41:02.630
Pedro.

41:04.797 --> 41:05.797
Pedro.

41:07.630 --> 41:08.963
Pedro, quit it!

41:10.630 --> 41:12.213
Do you want me to ground you?

41:12.588 --> 41:14.508
What have I told you
about running near the pool?

41:15.213 --> 41:16.547
I'm talking to you.

41:17.588 --> 41:19.088
Don't yell.

41:30.130 --> 41:32.255
This guy's really talented.

41:33.255 --> 41:36.547
Getting so far ahead in life
and without parents.

41:36.630 --> 41:37.672
What happened to them?

41:38.297 --> 41:41.255
They died in a car crash
when he was just a baby.

41:41.338 --> 41:44.380
Are you going to be here much longer?
I'm really tired.

41:44.463 --> 41:46.672
Honey, can we finish watching this show?

41:52.130 --> 41:55.213
- I'll be outside.
- Thank you, honey.

44:11.047 --> 44:13.547
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH

44:16.172 --> 44:17.172
Right...

46:14.255 --> 46:18.088
- How was the pool? Very good, right?
- But it was too crowded.

46:18.172 --> 46:19.338
It's always like that.

46:19.422 --> 46:22.422
But I saw you guys were in a private area.

46:22.505 --> 46:26.297
We had to make a reservation
the day before.

46:26.380 --> 46:28.088
You should've come too.

46:31.880 --> 46:37.880
We found a good supermarket nearby.
I mean, the prices were OK.

46:38.505 --> 46:39.588
Hey, buddy!

46:40.672 --> 46:42.047
What were you dreaming of?

46:44.547 --> 46:48.047
Good morning.
Would you like some breakfast?

46:50.547 --> 46:52.505
Instant coffee, please.

46:58.047 --> 47:00.713
- How are you?
- Fine. I just have a headache.

47:03.213 --> 47:05.588
- I don't want to stay with them anymore.
- Don't be rude.

47:05.672 --> 47:07.130
- Rude? How?
- They're here.

47:07.213 --> 47:08.255
So what?

47:09.505 --> 47:11.588
This vacation is just for us, hon.

47:11.672 --> 47:15.380
We came here to heal. They are ruining it.
We're already sharing the villa.

47:15.463 --> 47:17.547
- Why be with them all day?
- This is good for us.

47:17.630 --> 47:19.588
- How is it good for us?
- Can't you see?

47:19.672 --> 47:22.588
- What?
- Raton is really happy.

47:22.672 --> 47:25.963
- Pedro is happy everywhere.
- It's nice having grown-ups I can talk to.

47:26.047 --> 47:29.088
Grown-ups? Please! What can you
talk about with them? They're...

47:29.172 --> 47:33.005
- Please make an effort.
- You don't think I've been doing that?

47:34.380 --> 47:36.380
Why don't you stay here today? Rest.

47:36.463 --> 47:39.213
Stop telling me what to do.
I'm not the one who's sick.

47:42.422 --> 47:44.505
Daddy, can I swim in the pool?

47:44.588 --> 47:47.797
- You just had breakfast.
- Please. Please.

47:47.880 --> 47:50.547
- Ask your mom.
- Of course you can, honey.

48:03.588 --> 48:05.172
It took them long enough.

48:07.547 --> 48:08.588
Excuse me?

48:10.130 --> 48:12.422
It doesn't make sense for you
to attend English classes.

48:12.505 --> 48:13.922
I saw your name on the list.

48:17.255 --> 48:20.505
- I just want to improve.
- What for?

48:22.672 --> 48:23.963
I don't know.

48:25.713 --> 48:29.838
- I just don't want to lag behind.
- We're a liability to them.

48:31.547 --> 48:34.963
Even if you learned Chinese,
how long have you worked for this company?

48:36.672 --> 48:38.297
Down here?

48:39.338 --> 48:41.172
Four years, maybe less.

48:42.088 --> 48:44.463
You've been here in the gutter
for a long time.

48:45.005 --> 48:47.838
You can't leave
until you've become waste...

48:49.505 --> 48:50.838
or until you are spared.

48:53.963 --> 48:56.463
That's the only exit.

52:09.547 --> 52:10.547
Gloria.

54:52.338 --> 54:53.838
Gloria is already with them.

54:55.005 --> 54:56.255
And you know it.

55:02.630 --> 55:03.713
Follow me.

55:22.213 --> 55:25.338
- Where did you get this from?
- Put it away. Quick.

55:27.130 --> 55:30.172
That's the key for you
to give them all wrong numbers.

55:32.213 --> 55:33.588
Wrong numbers?

55:34.838 --> 55:38.630
All of this is a test
before they come for real.

55:38.713 --> 55:40.393
They'll leave if they don't sell anything.

55:41.963 --> 55:43.547
Should I be scared?

55:44.297 --> 55:47.213
Shouldn't they be scared instead?

56:08.547 --> 56:10.255
Hey. Here.

56:11.755 --> 56:14.588
Welcome, guys. How are you?

56:15.338 --> 56:17.505
- I'm Sergio.
- Nice to meet you.

56:17.588 --> 56:20.963
Oh, new aces. How are you? What's up?

56:21.047 --> 56:22.047
Hi.

56:23.172 --> 56:24.588
- How's it going?
- How are you?

56:25.463 --> 56:28.505
- Hi, sweetie. How are you?
- Fine.

56:28.588 --> 56:31.797
Awesome. So, let's warm up.

56:32.130 --> 56:34.505
Who here has played tennis before?

56:35.797 --> 56:40.922
Awesome. So, let's go to court number four
and get started.

56:41.672 --> 56:44.088
OK, Champ. This is a drive.

56:44.172 --> 56:47.630
I lift my hand to the back of my head,
I hit at the front and I put a scarf on.

56:51.213 --> 56:54.630
- Could you aim that closer to me?
- You want it closer?

56:58.047 --> 56:59.172
What happened?

57:00.588 --> 57:03.047
Come on, son. You can do it.
Come on, come on!

57:03.130 --> 57:06.338
What an asshole.
I can't believe he is with her.

57:06.922 --> 57:08.047
Let's go.

57:10.213 --> 57:12.630
Great arm. Good job!

57:16.755 --> 57:18.172
You can do it, player.

57:20.838 --> 57:22.172
That's it.

57:25.630 --> 57:27.630
Amazing! Spectacular!

57:29.338 --> 57:30.505
Come on!

57:32.172 --> 57:33.213
Yes!

57:33.630 --> 57:36.797
- That's it.
- Since when do you play tennis?

57:37.463 --> 57:40.130
I played for a while when I was 15.

57:40.213 --> 57:42.255
That's it. Spectacular!

57:42.338 --> 57:45.088
- Cool!
- You never told me that.

57:45.172 --> 57:47.047
Very good! Very good!

57:47.505 --> 57:48.922
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

57:49.880 --> 57:51.755
- Go.
- Are you OK?

57:53.213 --> 57:54.797
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah.

57:54.880 --> 57:55.880
Good.

57:57.005 --> 57:58.672
Bravo!

57:59.130 --> 58:00.422
That's my boy!

58:01.422 --> 58:02.838
OK, beautiful.

58:04.838 --> 58:07.380
Good. A little higher.

58:09.463 --> 58:11.880
Very good! Next.

58:13.172 --> 58:17.047
Dude, remember, eyes on the ball. Focus.

58:17.130 --> 58:19.505
Hit it this time, OK?

58:21.005 --> 58:22.297
What's wrong with you?

58:23.588 --> 58:25.713
- What happened?
- Could you hit it again, please?

58:25.797 --> 58:26.797
No. Next one, please.

58:26.838 --> 58:30.713
- The rules are the same for everyone.
- But you're hitting wrong!

58:30.797 --> 58:32.963
- Do you want another shot?
- Yes, please.

58:33.047 --> 58:36.297
- So, you're like an expert?
- Smile, buddy!

58:36.630 --> 58:37.630
For Facebook.

58:43.713 --> 58:45.463
Let me see, hon. Move your hands.

58:45.547 --> 58:49.922
Calm down. It's OK, let me see.

58:51.047 --> 58:54.047
Pedro? Look at me.
Please, call an ambulance!

59:11.922 --> 59:14.880
Easy, buddy. Calm down.
Everything is fine.

59:14.963 --> 59:15.963
Where am I?

59:16.047 --> 59:21.213
Easy, easy now.
Our families went home already.

59:21.297 --> 59:25.088
Such a shame. You really scared us.

59:25.172 --> 59:28.380
Why are you here? Why?

59:28.463 --> 59:31.797
Your wife fainted
because you bled heavily.

59:32.963 --> 59:37.130
She wasn't of any use to you.
It was better she went home.

59:37.213 --> 59:39.130
- Don't you think so?
- Yes.

59:39.213 --> 59:44.922
Don't you worry, buddy.
This is a first-class clinic.

59:48.963 --> 59:52.463
- Don Abel, nice to see you.
- How are you, Doc?

59:52.547 --> 59:55.172
- Very good, and you?
- How's my buddy doing?

59:55.255 --> 59:57.380
He broke his nose.

59:57.963 --> 01:00:02.255
Is this the first time he broke his nose?

01:00:02.672 --> 01:00:06.380
No. He broke his nose when he was a kid.
He was 11.

01:00:06.463 --> 01:00:09.547
- How did you know?
- It didn't heal properly.

01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:13.463
- Why?
- He should rest as much as he can.

01:00:13.547 --> 01:00:15.588
And keep him out of the sun.

01:00:16.672 --> 01:00:19.338
Perfect. Will do.
Anything else he might need?

01:00:19.422 --> 01:00:22.797
I'm giving him some pills.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.255
He should take one and a half
in the morning and at night.

01:00:26.338 --> 01:00:29.672
Perfect. Is that it?

01:00:29.755 --> 01:00:32.422
Well, we're here if you need anything.

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:37.088
- It's my pleasure to treat you.
- See, buddy? Let's go home.

01:00:37.172 --> 01:00:40.547
Careful. Take it slowly.

01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:42.880
Slowly. Come on.

01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:52.547
Wait here, buddy. I'm getting your meds.

01:01:24.005 --> 01:01:26.255
We have to be silent,
otherwise we'll wake them up.

01:01:26.338 --> 01:01:28.130
Not so loud.

01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:31.713
Be careful.

01:01:35.463 --> 01:01:38.505
- Oh, honey.
- I'm OK, it's fine.

01:01:38.588 --> 01:01:41.297
It's not too bad. He's OK.

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:44.630
- Did they give him something?
- A sedative.

01:01:45.213 --> 01:01:46.880
Careful, buddy.

01:01:53.838 --> 01:01:55.255
Don't get too worried, sis.

01:01:55.338 --> 01:01:58.755
The doctor said
it's not as bad as it looks.

01:02:06.547 --> 01:02:08.088
Is he going to need surgery?

01:02:08.172 --> 01:02:11.297
No, no, no. Not right now.
We'll have to see later on.

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:15.005
Right now, he needs to rest
and stay out of the sun.

01:02:15.088 --> 01:02:16.505
Lay down.

01:02:23.088 --> 01:02:25.005
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

01:02:29.588 --> 01:02:32.547
- I'm taking your shirt off.
- No. I'm fine.

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:35.755
- It's soaked in blood.
- Doesn't matter.

01:02:36.672 --> 01:02:38.463
He really scared us all.

01:02:47.213 --> 01:02:50.672
- How much was it?
- Don't you worry about it.

01:02:50.755 --> 01:02:53.713
We took care of the bill.
That's what family's for.

01:02:54.672 --> 01:02:57.963
Enjoy. Relax.
We'll swim in the sea after this.

01:02:59.172 --> 01:03:03.880
- We can't leave him alone, can we?
- It's best for him. He needs to rest.

01:03:03.963 --> 01:03:07.630
If you lock yourselves up,
he'll become very anxious.

01:03:07.713 --> 01:03:09.172
He's going to worry about you.

01:03:10.713 --> 01:03:12.088
Try to get some sleep.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.630
Don't worry, buddy.

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:23.297
I'll make sure your wife and your Raton
have a great time.

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.588
Good night. Thank you very much.

01:03:25.672 --> 01:03:27.755
Good night. Sleep well.

01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:38.547
Not long ago, my husband and I suffered...

01:03:41.922 --> 01:03:43.963
- a terrible tragedy.
- Good evening.

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:55.672
Let's have a break.

01:03:56.922 --> 01:03:59.963
Pull yourself together
and we'll start over.

01:04:06.213 --> 01:04:11.422
You have a really good story.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:17.963
Make it yours and it will be the best tool
in your arsenal.

01:04:20.588 --> 01:04:23.630
I've been trying to overcome this
for so many years.

01:04:24.588 --> 01:04:27.380
The best of us

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:32.505
take our personal tragedies

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:39.005
and turn them into opportunities

01:04:39.505 --> 01:04:41.547
for success.

01:04:43.255 --> 01:04:48.547
You are meant to be one of us.

01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:55.463
Shall we try it again?

01:05:01.338 --> 01:05:05.880
When my Rogelio went to heaven...

01:05:08.005 --> 01:05:11.547
my husband and I had many problems.

01:05:15.672 --> 01:05:18.338
We almost gave up, but...

01:05:19.672 --> 01:05:21.088
our family,

01:05:22.213 --> 01:05:25.047
the Vistamar family...

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:28.088
The Everfields family.

01:05:29.838 --> 01:05:33.005
"The Everfields family."

01:07:31.672 --> 01:07:32.672
What's up?

01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:39.755
- Mommy, can we watch a film?
- No, honey, Daddy is resting.

01:07:39.838 --> 01:07:41.547
- Please.
- No, honey.

01:07:43.755 --> 01:07:46.213
I think Pedrito
needs someone to play with.

01:07:46.297 --> 01:07:50.630
- Only children grow up spoiled. Twisted.
- Yeah.

01:07:50.713 --> 01:07:54.213
- He's very lonely.
- Lots of kids without siblings are fine.

01:07:54.297 --> 01:07:57.297
It's awful.
How can everything collapse so quickly?

01:07:57.380 --> 01:07:59.713
Don't worry. It's just a broken nose.

01:07:59.797 --> 01:08:02.213
But if something were to happen to him,
I would die!

01:08:02.963 --> 01:08:04.755
I don't know what Raton would do.

01:08:04.838 --> 01:08:09.130
We aren't worried,
because our kids have each other.

01:08:09.213 --> 01:08:11.380
They keep each other company.

01:08:11.463 --> 01:08:15.963
Pedrito deserves that,
having someone who'll always be with him.

01:08:16.046 --> 01:08:18.046
You still have time.

01:08:18.130 --> 01:08:21.171
The best gift you can give him
is more children.

01:08:21.546 --> 01:08:22.837
A baby brother.

01:08:23.337 --> 01:08:26.296
There's nothing worse
than being alone in this world.

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:31.837
Yes, sis, but you're not alone.

01:08:32.837 --> 01:08:36.880
I mean, you have us.
And I know we've just met, but...

01:08:38.296 --> 01:08:39.380
I don't know.

01:08:39.462 --> 01:08:44.462
There's something about this place
that is like magic, isn't there?

01:08:44.546 --> 01:08:45.921
To us,

01:08:46.005 --> 01:08:51.005
you've become part of our family.

01:08:51.337 --> 01:08:54.087
- Abel.
- I feel the same way, Evis.

01:08:57.087 --> 01:08:59.671
I'm fine, Eva. Don't worry.

01:08:59.755 --> 01:09:00.962
Thank you...

01:09:02.505 --> 01:09:04.587
for helping me heal.

01:09:05.546 --> 01:09:08.005
- Sis.
- It's never too late, Eva.

01:09:08.587 --> 01:09:09.796
It's never too late.

01:09:52.337 --> 01:09:53.337
Pedrito.

01:09:54.672 --> 01:09:55.672
Sweetie.

01:09:57.463 --> 01:10:00.463
I need you to wake up.
I have something to tell you.

01:10:02.422 --> 01:10:06.130
What's the matter?
Don't worry, love. Everything's fine.

01:10:07.588 --> 01:10:08.922
I need you to listen,

01:10:09.005 --> 01:10:11.422
because I have something important
to tell you, OK?

01:10:13.338 --> 01:10:16.838
You know I'm your dad, right?

01:10:18.172 --> 01:10:21.963
Abel and the rest, they're not our family.

01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:24.797
They're bad people.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:29.422
Do you remember that game we played?
"Impostors"? That's who they are.

01:10:29.963 --> 01:10:32.338
They're bad people
who want to break us apart.

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:36.130
And you know
that I love you very much, right?

01:10:37.463 --> 01:10:40.463
And you know
that I'm never leaving you alone?

01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:48.005
And you know
that I'll always be with you, right?

01:10:48.088 --> 01:10:51.422
Mom and I are your only family. That's it.

01:10:52.672 --> 01:10:55.088
Not them. OK?

01:10:55.505 --> 01:11:00.963
We have to be very smart, you and I.
So they won't hurt us.

01:11:49.922 --> 01:11:55.213
I won the lottery! I won the lottery!

01:11:55.297 --> 01:12:00.338
It's mine! I'm a millionaire!
I'm free and I'm a millionaire!

01:12:00.797 --> 01:12:06.047
It's mine! I won the lottery!

01:12:57.088 --> 01:13:01.755
PERSONAL FILE

01:14:20.797 --> 01:14:21.797
Hello.

01:14:36.088 --> 01:14:37.130
Who are you?

01:14:39.005 --> 01:14:40.297
I'm Andres.

01:15:06.505 --> 01:15:10.088
What's this? Who gave you this?
Where did you get this from?

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:15.380
Gloria, my wife. She works in sales.
Your family is one of her targets.

01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:24.172
They only want to sell.

01:15:27.297 --> 01:15:30.880
No, this isn't right. My wife is sick.

01:15:31.922 --> 01:15:33.672
I lost her for a year.

01:15:34.588 --> 01:15:38.172
She was committed for a year.
They can't use this information!

01:15:40.422 --> 01:15:42.547
At tonight's presentation,

01:15:43.047 --> 01:15:44.588
give them wrong numbers.

01:15:44.922 --> 01:15:47.588
It's all they care about.

01:15:47.672 --> 01:15:50.463
I'm not going to the presentation.

01:15:50.547 --> 01:15:52.755
I'm taking them away.

01:15:53.672 --> 01:15:54.797
I'm taking them with me.

01:15:55.463 --> 01:15:56.713
I'm taking them with me.

01:15:56.797 --> 01:15:59.213
But they have your family in their pocket.

01:16:00.547 --> 01:16:02.005
They will not leave willingly.

01:16:03.338 --> 01:16:06.380
If you take them away,
they'll turn against you.

01:16:06.463 --> 01:16:09.380
And then you'll do anything
to win them back.

01:16:09.838 --> 01:16:14.172
You'll buy a membership
and then there's no turning back.

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:18.797
And who are you? Andres who?

01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:22.630
Why are you doing this?

01:16:26.422 --> 01:16:29.588
I want to take something away from them
so they see what it feels like.

01:17:38.922 --> 01:17:44.338
A great vacation always gives us memories
of the time we spent with our family.

01:17:44.422 --> 01:17:50.422
But it's also an opportunity to inspire us
on the path towards success.

01:17:50.963 --> 01:17:54.172
Our family is not offering you a villa.

01:17:54.547 --> 01:17:59.088
Our family is giving you
the gift of inspiration.

01:18:00.672 --> 01:18:03.547
Please, close your eyes for a moment.

01:18:05.172 --> 01:18:09.922
Picture yourselves
as the owner of one of our villas.

01:18:11.047 --> 01:18:13.588
Your wife is opening a bottle of wine
from our cellar,

01:18:14.547 --> 01:18:17.672
and you toast with a picture-perfect
sunset in the background

01:18:17.755 --> 01:18:20.838
while your children
are happily playing in the pool,

01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:23.380
as they do every year.

01:18:25.255 --> 01:18:28.088
Focus on your heart.

01:18:31.172 --> 01:18:34.505
Can you feel your family's love?

01:18:37.672 --> 01:18:38.797
Open your eyes.

01:18:41.505 --> 01:18:43.380
That's what paradise feels like.

01:18:43.463 --> 01:18:46.588
And that's what Everfields
is offering you.

01:18:46.672 --> 01:18:51.463
Unforgettable moments that inspire you
to make your dreams come true.

01:18:53.130 --> 01:18:54.505
Any questions?

01:18:55.755 --> 01:18:56.797
Please.

01:18:57.755 --> 01:18:58.797
Thank you.

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:05.838
Good evening, excuse me.

01:19:05.922 --> 01:19:09.005
I wanted to thank you

01:19:09.088 --> 01:19:13.755
for all these beautiful moments.

01:19:13.838 --> 01:19:19.838
We like to think that, in just a few days,
our family has grown.

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:23.297
Like my wife always says,

01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:28.463
"There's nothing in this world
like a big happy family."

01:19:28.547 --> 01:19:30.880
So, thank you very much.

01:19:40.922 --> 01:19:42.963
Thank you, Abel.

01:19:43.047 --> 01:19:44.797
We also believe that.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.838
- Anyone else?
- Me.

01:19:47.213 --> 01:19:48.338
I have something to say.

01:19:49.047 --> 01:19:51.547
Hello, darling. Are you OK?

01:19:52.213 --> 01:19:55.963
- Sit down. I have something to say.
- Buddy.

01:19:56.588 --> 01:20:00.922
Hello. I don't have any questions,
I just want to say something.

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:02.797
Sit, sit.

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:06.755
I just want to say
that dreams don't come true in this place.

01:20:06.838 --> 01:20:09.088
Nightmares do. Nightmares come true here.

01:20:09.172 --> 01:20:10.338
Yes, nightmares.

01:20:10.422 --> 01:20:16.422
And this, my face, is not the worst thing
that's happened to me in this place.

01:20:16.505 --> 01:20:18.255
- This is.
- Me?

01:20:18.338 --> 01:20:19.547
- This is.
- Pedro.

01:20:20.755 --> 01:20:21.755
This is the worst.

01:20:21.838 --> 01:20:25.380
This man wants to take my family
away from me.

01:20:25.463 --> 01:20:29.338
He broke my nose. It was him, Eva.

01:20:29.422 --> 01:20:33.963
You put him in my villa, you did,
and that's what happened.

01:20:34.047 --> 01:20:35.505
Thank you very much.

01:20:35.588 --> 01:20:40.047
- Please, let me be the first to apologize.
- No, you're not the first to apologize.

01:20:40.130 --> 01:20:42.755
Everyone's been doing that,
but they don't do anything.

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:44.213
Nobody's done a thing.

01:20:44.297 --> 01:20:47.797
I'm truly sorry, I think
this is a very unfortunate situation,

01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.213
but Mr. Bonilla had nothing to do...

01:20:50.297 --> 01:20:52.922
I'm sure that he had everything
to do with it

01:20:53.005 --> 01:20:54.797
and that he is working for you.

01:20:55.213 --> 01:20:57.547
Mr. Bonilla is a pawn, working for you.

01:20:57.630 --> 01:21:01.213
He's a pawn who made his way into my villa
to turn my family against me.

01:21:01.297 --> 01:21:04.880
And all because I wouldn't take
your shitty deal.

01:21:04.963 --> 01:21:07.672
Mr. Alvarez, we're incapable
of doing something like that!

01:21:07.755 --> 01:21:09.963
Really? And what's all this?

01:21:10.047 --> 01:21:14.963
My wife's clinical file.
With private photographs.

01:21:15.588 --> 01:21:18.088
You followed us
and you broke into my house.

01:21:18.172 --> 01:21:20.588
You violated my privacy.

01:21:20.672 --> 01:21:22.463
And you have pictures of us.

01:21:22.547 --> 01:21:25.088
These people treat us
like their guinea pigs.

01:21:25.172 --> 01:21:28.297
- Honey, what are you talking about?
- This! I told you!

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:32.797
They're not our friends.
They're trying to trick us.

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:34.560
I told you.
Here's the evidence, all of it.

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:38.338
Don't listen to them
and don't drink anything they give you.

01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:10.463
No, I trusted you once.

01:22:10.547 --> 01:22:13.547
I trusted this man and he mocked me.

01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:16.380
He mocked my rights as a customer.

01:22:40.505 --> 01:22:43.880
- I told you, Eva. I fucking told you!
- Pedro! Pedro!

01:22:45.005 --> 01:22:46.505
You came here to heal.

01:22:50.338 --> 01:22:54.547
Do I look like I've healed?

01:22:55.672 --> 01:22:59.047
I know what it's like, struggling to heal.

01:23:00.047 --> 01:23:03.672
Look, my husband and I...

01:23:04.422 --> 01:23:07.213
saw our baby boy go to heaven.

01:23:08.755 --> 01:23:10.588
You don't know how hard it was.

01:23:11.005 --> 01:23:13.880
We felt very bad, I...

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:19.088
I couldn't get out of bed.
I couldn't even leave the house.

01:23:20.005 --> 01:23:24.130
But the Everfields family helped me.

01:23:24.213 --> 01:23:27.672
They picked us up
and showed us that we could do it.

01:23:27.755 --> 01:23:33.755
We got back on our feet on the path
to success to make your dreams come true.

01:23:35.213 --> 01:23:37.380
Let us become your family.

01:23:37.963 --> 01:23:41.005
We'll be there for you. Always.

01:23:41.088 --> 01:23:43.630
We're going to give you a home
twice a year

01:23:43.713 --> 01:23:46.130
to protect you
from all that is wrong outside.

01:23:47.505 --> 01:23:52.838
You, Eva and your Raton.
We'll welcome all of you with open arms.

01:23:52.922 --> 01:23:55.630
Who do you think you are?
Calling my son that?

01:23:55.713 --> 01:23:57.963
Talking about him like that?

01:23:58.047 --> 01:23:59.755
You know nothing about family!

01:23:59.838 --> 01:24:03.297
What is Andres to you?
How is your husband doing?

01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:04.713
Is he even part of your family?

01:24:04.797 --> 01:24:07.505
- You know Andres?
- Yes! You screwed him, just like me.

01:24:07.588 --> 01:24:10.088
You people fucked him. Made him crazy.

01:24:10.172 --> 01:24:12.713
You don't know what it's like.
Carrying someone.

01:24:13.047 --> 01:24:15.088
Yes, I do!

01:24:15.588 --> 01:24:16.672
And you don't give up.

01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:20.588
You don't give up on your family.
You stay.

01:24:20.672 --> 01:24:22.963
You stay right there, with your family.

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:27.880
And you don't try to be someone else.

01:24:31.005 --> 01:24:35.422
This is not paradise.
Not for me. Not for you.

01:24:35.713 --> 01:24:36.713
Buddy.

01:24:38.047 --> 01:24:41.338
Don't you recognize us? We're your family.

01:24:41.797 --> 01:24:44.047
Calm down. Have a drink.

01:24:44.797 --> 01:24:47.838
Buddy, what are you doing? Let me go!

01:24:47.922 --> 01:24:49.422
Let go of me!

01:24:49.505 --> 01:24:52.755
You're the devil, asshole.
You're the devil!

01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:57.380
- You're the devil! Son of bitch!
- Pedro, stop it!

01:24:57.463 --> 01:24:59.297
You're the devil!

01:25:03.130 --> 01:25:04.380
What's wrong with you?

01:25:07.172 --> 01:25:09.005
He's the devil.

01:25:10.047 --> 01:25:12.963
He's the devil.

01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:49.380
Why did you do it?

01:27:00.713 --> 01:27:02.463
It was my opportunity.

01:27:09.005 --> 01:27:10.463
I'm fed up.

01:27:21.172 --> 01:27:22.880
I can't stand you.

01:27:28.088 --> 01:27:30.297
You're not part of this family anymore.

01:28:58.547 --> 01:28:59.547
Eva.

01:29:42.963 --> 01:29:44.130
Hold it.

01:29:45.305 --> 01:29:51.270
