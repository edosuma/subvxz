- Stop.
- What?

14:02.200 --> 14:04.430
Cartier's having a sale.
Pick me up in an hour.

14:10.810 --> 14:13.900
- Where are you going?
- To get a bus schedule.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.970
CARLTON:
Can't we just talk about this?

14:17.150 --> 14:21.020
Listen, I don't wanna talk about nothing.
I just wanna watch the game and forget it.

14:21.190 --> 14:23.350
Fine with me.

14:23.520 --> 14:25.510
[CHATTERING ON TV]

14:26.690 --> 14:28.720
Careful with that drumstick, Uncle Phil.

14:28.890 --> 14:31.120
Turn your back,
Carlton's liable to start eating and say:

14:31.300 --> 14:34.090
"Oops. Dad, it just jumped in my mouth. "

14:35.730 --> 14:38.790
That wouldn't happen if you
treated the drumstick like a person...

14:38.970 --> 14:40.960
...instead of a piece of meat.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.170
You know what, Carlton?

14:44.340 --> 14:46.400
You ain't nothing but a dog.

14:46.580 --> 14:51.210
Oh, yeah? Well, you're an acrimonious,
rancorous, virulent coveter.

14:51.720 --> 14:55.280
Oh, yeah?
Well, you ain't nothing but a dog.

14:55.450 --> 14:56.920
All right, all right.

14:57.090 --> 14:59.920
That's enough.
Look, why don't I tell you guys a story?

15:00.390 --> 15:02.620
Now look what you done.

15:03.690 --> 15:05.180
I like Dad's stories.

15:05.360 --> 15:10.300
And some day, I'm gonna tell my kids
these same pointless anecdotes.

15:10.870 --> 15:12.430
Go ahead, Dad.

15:14.770 --> 15:15.900
All right.

15:16.070 --> 15:19.410
Well, when I was growing up,
my best friend lived in the next apartment.

15:19.580 --> 15:20.600
His name was Ralph.

15:20.780 --> 15:24.040
And one day, after 18 years of friendship,
we had a fight.

15:24.210 --> 15:26.680
Well, I went to college
and he joined the Navy.

15:27.050 --> 15:29.320
Five years ago
I went to our high school reunion.

15:29.490 --> 15:31.890
I was determined to bury the hatchet.

15:32.060 --> 15:34.220
But Ralph didn't show up.

15:34.390 --> 15:36.480
I found out that he died
the month before.

15:37.660 --> 15:41.060
Well, I never had a chance
to make peace with him.

15:41.230 --> 15:45.530
What's even worse, I can't even remember
what we fought about.

15:46.870 --> 15:49.030
You kids should think about that.

15:50.870 --> 15:53.170
WILL:
Hold up a second there, Aesop.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.770
What's this apartment stuff?
Thought you grew up on a farm.

15:57.480 --> 16:01.940
Well, in the South, "farm" and "apartment"
are interchangeable.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.140
Uh... Uh, uh, five years ago?

16:04.320 --> 16:08.160
Since when do they have reunions
for your 22nd year?

16:08.330 --> 16:12.990
- Yeah, man. And how all of a sudden...?
- Okay, okay, I made it up. All right? Pfft.

16:14.770 --> 16:18.960
Huh. I guess lying just run
all through this family, huh?

16:19.570 --> 16:23.340
I'm not lying,
you nefarious, degenerate miscreant.

16:23.510 --> 16:28.410
Oh, like I'm supposed to believe that,
you big dog.

16:36.390 --> 16:39.360
Did you put super glue in my hair gel?

16:40.490 --> 16:41.520
[CHUCKLES]

16:41.690 --> 16:43.820
Hey, that's what you get
for stealing my girl.

16:43.990 --> 16:49.130
I didn't have to steal her. She was bored
with you so she came to me, a real man.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.630
So, what you saying? I'm not a real man?

16:52.800 --> 16:54.500
Yeah, you got it. You should know...

16:54.670 --> 16:59.440
...that all that "yo, yo, hey, baby,
bap, bap, bap" stuff is just played out.

16:59.610 --> 17:02.700
It worked in high school,
but now it's just embarrassing.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.849
So I'm the embarrassment now?

17:06.680 --> 17:08.880
Take it easy, stumpy.

17:09.050 --> 17:11.819
You know something else?
I'm tired of all those short jokes.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.680
I'm average height.

17:14.190 --> 17:15.950
For a woman.

17:17.430 --> 17:20.230
I'm large enough for Valerie.

17:25.569 --> 17:27.829
You wants to go there, huh?

17:28.040 --> 17:30.230
You know what? I'm sick of this.

17:30.410 --> 17:32.240
Let's go. Let's go right now.

17:32.410 --> 17:35.140
I'm sick of this. I'm sick of this.

17:35.950 --> 17:39.210
Come on, come on. Let's go, come on,
what, what, what you want to do?

17:42.850 --> 17:45.720
Pfft. Like that hurt.

17:47.690 --> 17:50.290
Will. Will, are you okay?

17:50.460 --> 17:52.290
Will, wake up.

17:52.460 --> 17:54.430

[CARLTON GRUNTS]

18:16.420 --> 18:18.680
Damn, still alive.

18:19.090 --> 18:22.320
You know what keeps me going?
The thought of dancing on your grave.

18:22.990 --> 18:25.620
Dance on my grave, will you? Damn.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.390
Come, Mr. Smith.
It's time for your sponge bath.

18:28.570 --> 18:32.760
Oh, hey, good thing too,
because I'm feeling dirty. Ha-ha-ha.

18:32.940 --> 18:34.800
- Tootsie roll.
CARLTON: Oh.

18:34.970 --> 18:36.960
Oh, my leg. My leg.

18:39.340 --> 18:44.440
Aw. Come on, girl, you gonna fall
for that? What about my sponge bath?

18:44.620 --> 18:47.080
I'll let you shave me. Ha-ha-ha.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.820
Let me take care of Mr. Banks first.

18:50.990 --> 18:53.390
Oh. I get it.

18:53.560 --> 18:57.190
First you steal my girl
and now you're gonna steal my nurse.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.630
You old prune.
I ought to knock your teeth out.

19:00.800 --> 19:04.200
Go ahead,
they're in the glass next to my bed.

19:05.570 --> 19:07.900
Is that what you want? Aw.

19:08.070 --> 19:10.870
Got to go back to the ghetto
on you now.

19:11.780 --> 19:13.800
[WILL YELLS]

19:14.950 --> 19:17.810
You're trying to kill me.

19:31.060 --> 19:32.650
You all right?

19:32.830 --> 19:35.230
- Come closer.
- You all right?

19:35.400 --> 19:38.490
I'm feeling the life
being sucked out of me.

19:38.940 --> 19:42.960
Before I die I just want you to know
that I...

19:43.140 --> 19:47.200
I hate you. Ha-ha-ha.

19:51.110 --> 19:54.050
Carlton, wake up.

19:55.690 --> 19:57.180
Carlton.

19:57.890 --> 20:00.480
I never got to tell you I'm sorry.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.650
[CRYING]

20:09.530 --> 20:11.970
Why, Carlton?

20:13.340 --> 20:16.830
Will, hold you head back.
It'll stop the bleeding.

20:21.310 --> 20:24.870
Thank you, Carlton.
I think you've helped enough.

20:32.890 --> 20:34.650
I guess you're wondering
what happened.

20:34.830 --> 20:37.020
What's to wonder? Ha, ha.

20:37.390 --> 20:41.130
I have a nephew
with a possibly broken nose.

20:42.530 --> 20:45.930
And I don't wanna even know why
your damn hands are stuck to your head.

20:46.440 --> 20:51.840
What I do know is that I want both of you
to settle this thing or I will.

20:54.010 --> 20:56.000
CARLTON: You got it, Dad. No problem.
WILL: You got it.

20:56.180 --> 20:57.540
- We can handle it.
CARLTON: It's done.

20:57.710 --> 20:59.940
We can handle it. Just go on.

21:04.590 --> 21:06.450
Look, Carlton, um...

21:07.560 --> 21:10.790
...I was doing a lot of thinking
while I was unconscious.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.660
We're cousins, man.
We've been together long enough.

21:15.830 --> 21:20.290
I should know you would never do to me
the kind of things that I would do to you.

21:21.170 --> 21:23.000
That's sweet, Will.

21:23.170 --> 21:27.670
I'm sorry for saying all those things
and for punching your lights out.

21:29.380 --> 21:31.180
It was a lucky shot.

21:31.350 --> 21:33.250
I hit you pretty square, Will.

21:33.420 --> 21:37.110
Look, the important thing
is that we get beyond that lucky punch.

21:38.660 --> 21:40.150
We're family, man.

21:40.320 --> 21:43.760
We shouldn't be fighting like this.
We should be helping each other.

21:44.730 --> 21:46.290
Hey, put her there.

21:47.660 --> 21:49.560
