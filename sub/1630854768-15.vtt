WEBVTT

00:01.393 --> 00:05.004
-(sirens wailing)
-(horn blaring)

00:10.827 --> 00:12.252
Whew.
Damn, that thing's cookin'.

00:12.404 --> 00:14.346
Yeah. EV cars, man.
Batteries burn extra hot.

00:14.498 --> 00:16.256
Yeah, we're gonna need
all the water we can get.

00:16.408 --> 00:18.075
Looks like the high-voltage
cells underneath

00:18.093 --> 00:19.243
are already
fully compromised.

00:19.261 --> 00:20.911
Y'all get that
one-and-a-half hooked up.

00:20.913 --> 00:23.247
-PAUL STRICKLAND: Copy that.
-This was not my fault.

00:23.249 --> 00:25.249
-JUDD RYDER: You the pick-up?
-I'm sure I had the green light.

00:25.251 --> 00:26.692
He just came flying
through the intersection.

00:26.919 --> 00:28.877
Okay. Captain Vega and her team,
they're gonna take care of you.

00:28.954 --> 00:30.771
Alright. Why don't you walk
to the ambulance with us,

00:30.847 --> 00:31.605
take a look?

00:31.757 --> 00:33.032
JUDD:
Marwani, Strickland.

00:33.275 --> 00:35.592
Start to tamp them flames down
so we can get the driver out.

00:35.611 --> 00:38.278
Hey, there's no driver.
He just walked off.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.613
There's a passenger
in the back seat.
I tried to get him out.

00:39.782 --> 00:41.540
-I couldn't get close enough.
-Hey, scratch that.

00:41.691 --> 00:44.101
No driver, we got a victim
in the backseat, so make a path.

00:44.103 --> 00:45.360
Chavez, get in there
with hand tools.

00:45.604 --> 00:47.454
-You're gonna pull 'em out.
-MATEO CHAVEZ: Copy that.

00:47.531 --> 00:49.465
♪ ♪

01:01.545 --> 01:02.519
Alright, kill 'em.

01:03.622 --> 01:04.563
Chavez, you're up.

01:05.808 --> 01:06.899
(Mateo gasps)

01:07.309 --> 01:09.293
PAUL: Damn.
It's like one of those
trick birthday candles.

01:09.311 --> 01:11.219
Hey, get them hoses
back on there!

01:11.297 --> 01:13.113
And keep 'em there!

01:16.893 --> 01:18.535
Alright, Chavez, get him out.

01:20.973 --> 01:22.456
(glass shatters)

01:24.919 --> 01:26.543
MATEO: We're gonna
get you out of here, sir.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.630
Alright, he's clear!

01:33.910 --> 01:36.095
PAUL:
We got you, buddy.
We got you.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.429
(man coughing)

01:38.991 --> 01:41.266
(tense music playing)

01:45.331 --> 01:46.438
TK, vitals.

01:46.756 --> 01:47.755
TK STRAND:
He's breathing
and his airways are clear,

01:47.775 --> 01:48.999
but he's tachycardic, Cap.

01:49.168 --> 01:51.926
Nancy, get him on O2
and then radio West Park.

01:52.004 --> 01:53.529
-Let 'em know we're on our way.
-Copy.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.406
Hey, kill it.

01:58.768 --> 01:59.843
Y'all did good work.

01:59.936 --> 02:02.512
Well, at least the fire's out.
(chuckles)

02:02.531 --> 02:04.957
(flames roaring)

02:05.184 --> 02:06.683
You had to say it, didn't ya?

02:06.685 --> 02:09.002
(siren wailing)

02:10.189 --> 02:12.856
-(moans)
-TOMMY VEGA: Sir, you with us?

02:12.858 --> 02:14.282
You've been
in an accident.

02:14.360 --> 02:15.634
Can you open
your eyes for me?

02:15.785 --> 02:17.194
(monitor beeping)

02:17.212 --> 02:19.638
-Concussion?
-Pupillary response is fine.

02:19.715 --> 02:22.048
And his lungs don't sound like
they have much smoke damage.

02:22.201 --> 02:23.884
As far as I can tell,
there-there's no head injury.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.477
-There's no blunt-force trauma.
-TK: So what's it mean?

02:25.629 --> 02:28.480
It means he might have been
this way before the accident.

02:28.557 --> 02:30.482
-How?
-I...

02:30.634 --> 02:32.359
(monitor beeping)

02:35.156 --> 02:37.547
This scar is
from a dialysis shunt.

02:37.566 --> 02:38.657
(Tommy sighs)

02:40.143 --> 02:42.077
TK: What is that?

02:42.812 --> 02:45.146
Nancy, radio West Park.

02:45.166 --> 02:47.908
Tell 'em to have their
transplant unit on standby.

02:48.026 --> 02:49.393
He needs a transplant?

02:49.395 --> 02:52.654
Judging by these staples,
he's already had one.

02:52.731 --> 02:53.730
I'm guessing kidney.

02:54.583 --> 02:57.401
He's unresponsive because
he's still under anesthesia
from the surgery.

02:57.419 --> 03:00.404
-(groans weakly)
-Sir, I need you to stay still.

03:00.406 --> 03:02.181
We're gonna get you
back to the hospital.

03:02.257 --> 03:04.090
This time,
you're gonna stay there.

03:04.243 --> 03:06.226
(siren wailing)

03:12.860 --> 03:14.084
Where's the trauma team?

03:14.102 --> 03:15.510
The radio nurse
just told me to stand by.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.345
They're still waiting for
the transplant nephrologist

03:17.439 --> 03:18.846
-to get back from lunch.
-Oh, the hell with that.

03:19.015 --> 03:21.258
Nancy, go into the commissary
and get that doctor yourself

03:21.351 --> 03:22.868
-if you have to.
-NANCY GILLIAN: Copy, Cap.

03:22.945 --> 03:24.453
On my way to ruin lunch.

03:25.447 --> 03:26.947
(rattling)

03:27.099 --> 03:29.291
(suspenseful music playing)

03:34.864 --> 03:36.381
TOMMY: TK? Hey.

03:37.367 --> 03:38.291
TK? Hey.

03:38.444 --> 03:39.867
-(TK groans)
-TK, can you hear me?

03:39.887 --> 03:42.054
Oh, he got me good, Cap.

03:42.205 --> 03:43.889
-Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.
-(TK groans)

03:43.966 --> 03:46.683
Where is he? (groans)

03:47.711 --> 03:49.061
(sighs)

03:50.456 --> 03:51.304
Gone.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.791
(theme music plays)

03:55.294 --> 03:58.111
Okay, you guys, be honest.
Is it noticeable?

03:59.631 --> 04:00.572
(group gasps)

04:00.724 --> 04:01.889
It's that bad, isn't it?

04:01.967 --> 04:02.890
No, it's not.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.726
They literally
just gasped, Nancy.

04:04.803 --> 04:07.079
You guys, will you tell him
that it's not that bad?

04:07.230 --> 04:09.939
-Oh...
-Let me take a little...

04:09.941 --> 04:11.416
Oh, no, no,
that's not that bad.

04:11.568 --> 04:12.734
-That's not bad at all.
-Yeah.

04:12.828 --> 04:15.254
I mean, yeah, your-your face.
It looks, um...

04:15.756 --> 04:16.904
symmetrical.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.574
-(Judd clears throat)
-Paul. Come on.

04:19.651 --> 04:21.009
Tell me the truth.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.411
I'm sure it'll go down
by the wedding.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.413
It's not the wedding
I'm worried about, alright?

04:25.507 --> 04:27.749
Carlos and I are meeting
my Uncle Robert tonight
for the first time.

04:27.826 --> 04:29.843
Oh, yeah, you definitely wanna
get a good concealer then, bro.

04:29.919 --> 04:31.252
-(sighs deeply)
-MARJAN MARWANI: Wait.

04:31.346 --> 04:32.996
You're meeting your uncle
for the first time tonight?

04:32.998 --> 04:34.331
Well, it's my dad's
half-brother.

04:34.333 --> 04:37.017
He met him last year
when he went to California.

04:37.093 --> 04:38.926
You gonna be
in a room full of Strands.

04:39.004 --> 04:40.670
The odds are, you ain't gonna
be the only one with a shiner.

04:40.689 --> 04:41.763
-(laughter)
-PAUL: True that.

04:41.857 --> 04:43.189
No, but seriously, though,
how does a guy

04:43.266 --> 04:45.784
who looked like a vegetable
at the accident scene

04:45.935 --> 04:48.345
just get up and hit you
with a right cross?

04:48.363 --> 04:49.437
DETECTIVE BRIAN McGREGOR:
<i> Renal failure?</i>

04:49.456 --> 04:50.831
Well, that's my best guess.

04:50.940 --> 04:54.351
I mean, it would account
for the sudden violent behavior.

04:54.353 --> 04:56.461
Well, in my experience,
sudden violent behavior

04:56.613 --> 04:59.022
can be caused
by a lot of things.

04:59.282 --> 05:01.967
Renal failure is not usually
at the top of that list.

05:02.303 --> 05:05.119
Detective McGregor,
that-that patient

05:05.139 --> 05:07.864
couldn't have been
more than three hours

05:07.866 --> 05:09.366
off of the operating table

05:09.810 --> 05:11.793
after having
a kidney transplant.

05:11.870 --> 05:13.145
-So?
-TOMMY: So...

05:13.296 --> 05:16.039
you are required
to be hospitalized

05:16.058 --> 05:17.799
for four to six days.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.300
Whichever hospital
released him

05:19.320 --> 05:21.820
is facing criminal
negligence charges.

05:21.971 --> 05:23.229
McGREGOR:
Well, here's the thing.

05:23.306 --> 05:25.565
No hospital anywhere
near that accident site

05:25.642 --> 05:27.734
performed a kidney transplant
on a guy

05:27.886 --> 05:29.644
matching John Doe's
description.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.721
Are you saying that this...

05:32.224 --> 05:33.573
is an underground operation?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.000
It would appear so.

05:35.077 --> 05:37.836
Then you have a much
bigger problem on your hands.

05:38.321 --> 05:40.397
You need to find him
right away.

05:40.415 --> 05:43.066
We don't have the resources
to put together a manhunt

05:43.085 --> 05:44.751
for a half-dead patient.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.846
Even if he managed to clunk
your paramedic on the head.

05:47.923 --> 05:50.907
You're missing
a much bigger point
here, Detective.

05:50.909 --> 05:53.018
And what would
that be, Captain?

05:53.854 --> 05:56.763
The question isn't
where your John Doe is.

05:57.249 --> 05:59.441
The question is,
where did he get that kidney?

06:01.845 --> 06:05.155
(woman breathing heavily)

06:09.611 --> 06:11.536
(panting)

06:12.873 --> 06:14.614
(keypad beeping)

06:14.858 --> 06:17.267
-(line ringing)
-GRACE RYDER (over phone):
<i> 9-1-1. What's your emergency?</i>

06:18.027 --> 06:19.628
WOMAN (gasping):
Okay, please help me.

06:20.697 --> 06:21.955
I'm freezing.

06:22.031 --> 06:23.882
I think somebody
did something to me.

06:24.776 --> 06:26.701
GRACE:<i> What do you mean</i>
<i> did something to you?</i>

06:26.778 --> 06:27.777
(woman panting)

06:27.796 --> 06:28.945
I don't know where I am.

06:28.964 --> 06:30.280
Uh... I...

06:30.298 --> 06:33.708
I woke up in a bathtub
filled with ice.

06:34.636 --> 06:37.287
Okay. And you're at the
Sleep Tite Inn, is that right?

06:37.347 --> 06:40.399
WOMAN: I don't know.
I don't remember anything. I...

06:40.550 --> 06:42.475
I think he must have
drugged me.

06:42.886 --> 06:44.051
And my head's fuzzy

06:44.129 --> 06:46.387
and e-everything is j-just numb.
(sharp inhale)

06:46.465 --> 06:47.906
Okay. What's
your name, sweetie?

06:48.057 --> 06:49.616
WOMAN (over phone):
(gasping)<i> Lexi.</i>

06:50.152 --> 06:51.058
Lexi.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.744
Okay, Lexi, listen,
my name is Grace.

06:52.896 --> 06:54.246
I'm getting some help
to you, okay?

06:54.415 --> 06:56.990
<i> But in the meantime, we gotta</i>
<i> get you out of that bathtub</i>

06:57.066 --> 06:58.825
<i> so that you</i>
<i> don't get hypothermia.</i>

06:58.902 --> 07:00.377
(gasping) Oh, okay. okay.

07:02.497 --> 07:03.496
(groans sharply)

07:03.573 --> 07:04.548
(panting)

07:06.334 --> 07:07.092
(groans)

07:07.319 --> 07:09.428
-(panting)
-(water dripping)

07:10.656 --> 07:11.746
(labored) Okay. Okay.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.099
(ice clatters)

07:14.826 --> 07:16.342
(panting)

07:16.419 --> 07:17.418
(gasps)

07:17.604 --> 07:20.439
Oh, my God. Oh, my, God!
Oh, my, God! (gasping)

07:20.515 --> 07:21.440
Lexi, what's going on?

07:21.516 --> 07:23.942
(whimpers)
Somebody cut me open.

07:24.093 --> 07:25.685
I'm-I'm-I'm bleeding.

07:26.021 --> 07:27.428
Where are you bleeding from?

07:28.115 --> 07:30.840
There's staples,
and it's leaking bad.

07:30.859 --> 07:32.617
Lexi, are there towels around?

07:32.694 --> 07:34.027
Yes, yeah.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.604
I want you to grab one
and roll it up, okay?

07:36.698 --> 07:39.791
<i> And then lie down</i>
<i> or kneel up against it.</i>

07:39.868 --> 07:41.184
Try to put some
pressure on the wound, okay?

07:41.186 --> 07:43.128
That should help
to slow the bleeding down.

07:43.205 --> 07:44.588
Okay. Oh...

07:46.525 --> 07:47.466
(winces)

07:47.617 --> 07:49.426
(labored breathing)

07:51.162 --> 07:54.214
Okay. Okay, I'm doing it.
(sharp exhale)

07:54.308 --> 07:56.141
Okay, good.
Now, paramedics are on the way,

07:56.368 --> 07:58.051
but we gotta figure out
what room you're in

07:58.127 --> 07:59.719
<i> so that they can find you.</i>

07:59.871 --> 08:00.962
LEXI:
I don't know! I don't...

08:01.039 --> 08:02.372
(Lexi breathing heavily)

08:02.465 --> 08:03.723
Sarah.

08:04.392 --> 08:05.742
I need you to call
the Sleep Tite Inn

08:05.744 --> 08:07.227
and figure out
which of their rooms right now

08:07.303 --> 08:08.895
are currently
using their landline, okay?

08:08.972 --> 08:10.063
It can't be that many of them.

08:10.215 --> 08:11.064
(gasps)

08:11.307 --> 08:13.474
I'm gonna die in here,
aren't I, Grace?

08:13.552 --> 08:14.659
GRACE:<i> No, ma'am.</i>

08:16.071 --> 08:17.311
Rescue 122.
What's your status?

08:17.331 --> 08:18.738
PARAMEDIC (over phone):
<i> We're on scene.</i>

08:18.832 --> 08:20.406

<i> help is at the hotel,</i>

08:22.577 --> 08:23.943
<i> so if you hear</i>
<i> a knock at the door,</i>

08:24.095 --> 08:25.170
<i> I want you to let me know.</i>

08:25.413 --> 08:28.414
Alright? Otherwise, just listen
to the sound of my voice

08:28.509 --> 08:30.509
<i> and keep talking</i>
<i> to me, okay?</i>

08:31.494 --> 08:32.585
(weakly) Okay.

08:38.760 --> 08:39.926
GRACE:<i> Lexi?</i>

-Lexi, can you hear me?
-(labored breathing)

08:43.023 --> 08:44.856
<i> Lexi, you still with me, baby?</i>

08:45.008 --> 08:46.358
<i> Keep talking to me.</i>

-(shallow breathing)
-Yeah, it's me, baby.

08:56.762 --> 08:59.538
I'm here. You just,
you keep talking to me,
okay?

09:00.707 --> 09:02.356
I'm not cold anymore.

09:02.434 --> 09:03.500
(panting)

09:04.527 --> 09:05.502
<i> I'm better now.</i>

09:06.529 --> 09:07.504
<i> Warm.</i>

09:08.531 --> 09:09.956
<i> I'm just gonna...</i>

09:10.108 --> 09:11.958
(sighs)<i> close my eyes</i>
<i> for a second.</i>

09:11.960 --> 09:14.052
(Lexi panting)

09:14.203 --> 09:15.036
Uh-uh, Lexi.

09:15.297 --> 09:16.796
Uh-uh, baby,
you have to wake up. Lexi!

09:16.948 --> 09:20.617
117. The clerk said the only
landline operating at the inn

09:20.619 --> 09:21.968
is in room 117.

09:22.045 --> 09:23.711
-(computer beeps)
-Rescue 122.

09:23.789 --> 09:25.713
Your patient is in room 117.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.524
Go, go, go. Right now.

09:28.885 --> 09:30.277
PARAMEDIC: She's in here.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.406
<i> Ma'am?</i>
<i> Ma'am, can you hear me?</i>

09:35.967 --> 09:37.284
<i> No pulse.</i>

09:41.306 --> 09:43.323
I'm putting her on the LifePak.
Start drying her off.

09:43.399 --> 09:46.159
GRACE:<i> Rescue 122.</i>
<i> I need the patient's status</i>
<i> when you're able.</i>

09:46.161 --> 09:48.128
PARAMEDIC:
She's in V-tach.

09:50.498 --> 09:52.090
Stand back. Clear.

09:52.500 --> 09:53.316
(thuds)

09:53.409 --> 09:54.818
<i> Patient's unresponsive.</i>

09:55.170 --> 09:57.244
<i> Shocking her again. Clear.</i>

09:57.914 --> 09:59.306
<i> -Shock.</i>
-(defibrillator thuds)

10:02.160 --> 10:03.584

<i> -Ma'am, can you hear me?</i>
-(monitor beeping)

10:06.014 --> 10:08.440
-(weakly) Uh, yeah.
-PARAMEDIC: We're gonna
take care of you.

10:08.516 --> 10:10.257
Start a line.
Run it wide open.

10:10.319 --> 10:12.444
Dispatch, patient
is awake and responsive.

10:12.595 --> 10:14.170
-Oh, my God.
-PARAMEDIC:
<i> Please let West Park know</i>

10:14.172 --> 10:15.596
<i> that we are</i>
<i> bringing her in now.</i>

10:15.674 --> 10:19.100
Okay, will do.
Rescue 122, thank you.

10:19.527 --> 10:20.768
Her name's Lexi, okay?

10:20.862 --> 10:22.454
Please take care of her.

10:22.530 --> 10:23.622
PARAMEDIC:<i> Copy that.</i>

10:24.532 --> 10:25.665
(line beeps)

10:38.121 --> 10:39.304
So, Robert,
you were saying

10:39.455 --> 10:40.530
that this is
your first time in Texas?

10:40.699 --> 10:41.881
ROBERT STRAND:
I've been through it before.

10:42.033 --> 10:43.383
You know,
it's kinda hard to avoid

10:43.459 --> 10:45.960
when you're traveling east
from Southern California.

10:46.037 --> 10:47.294
Well, I wish
you'd given me more notice

10:47.314 --> 10:49.463
'cause I would have taken
more time off from work.

10:49.541 --> 10:50.815
Well, the point was
not for you

10:50.967 --> 10:52.817
to have to take time
off of work.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.636
I'm just grateful that you were
able to find time for this.

10:55.714 --> 10:58.715
Are you kidding me?
My only brother comes to town,
I'm taking time off.

10:58.733 --> 11:01.050
And you are gonna stay
till at least Saturday

11:01.052 --> 11:02.476
so we can make up
for lost time.

11:02.554 --> 11:03.477
Okay.

11:03.571 --> 11:05.497
Uncle Robert,
do you have any photos

11:05.724 --> 11:06.998
of my cousins
you could show us?

11:07.075 --> 11:08.741
Oh, yeah. No, absolutely.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.910
Um, this is Hannah.

11:11.246 --> 11:13.746
She is 17
and currently obsessed

11:13.899 --> 11:15.748
with choir
and musical theater.

11:15.901 --> 11:17.567
Nice.

11:17.585 --> 11:18.401
OWEN STRAND: Hmm.

11:18.403 --> 11:21.096
(chuckles) And that is...

11:21.848 --> 11:23.256
That's Yvonne. (chuckles)

11:23.332 --> 11:24.015
Sorry, it was--

11:24.167 --> 11:26.576
She is, um, about to be 15,

11:26.594 --> 11:30.605
and she loves soccer
and softball.

11:31.917 --> 11:33.249
-Of course.
-They-they both say hello.

11:33.585 --> 11:35.026
Well, I cannot wait
to meet them

11:35.103 --> 11:36.602
and the rest of your family.

11:36.755 --> 11:38.863
Well, they're
your family, too, now, TK.

11:39.925 --> 11:42.033
Speaking of which...
(heavy sigh)

11:42.185 --> 11:44.619
some relics from our dad.

11:50.101 --> 11:51.075
Oh, I remember that.

11:51.228 --> 11:52.377
-It's his Leatherman.
-Yeah.

11:52.528 --> 11:54.938
He said you always thought
this was really cool.

11:54.940 --> 11:56.864
Yeah, and he never
let me touch it.

11:56.942 --> 11:59.125
Well, it is all yours now.

12:00.462 --> 12:04.139
Along with our dad's most
prized possession of all.

12:06.634 --> 12:07.967
La Sucre 1989?

12:08.061 --> 12:10.453
Yeah, I had to crack
into his safe to get that.

12:10.455 --> 12:13.047
Wow. I'm surprised
it didn't come with
an armed escort.

12:13.716 --> 12:16.960
TK, I thought
that you might like this.

12:17.738 --> 12:21.222
This was your grandfather's
personal journal.

12:21.299 --> 12:24.743
-Wait, Dad journaled?
-ROBERT: Yeah, like every night.

12:24.894 --> 12:26.819
I mean,
until his health gave out.

12:26.972 --> 12:29.155
But, yeah,
he-he journaled a lot.

12:29.232 --> 12:31.324
Are you sure
that you don't wanna keep it?

12:31.476 --> 12:33.977
I mean, he was your dad.
I-I never even met him.

12:34.403 --> 12:36.662
Well, I thought this would be
a nice way for you

12:36.739 --> 12:37.981
to get to know him

12:38.483 --> 12:39.924
even if just a, a little bit.

12:40.076 --> 12:41.575
TK: Alright. Well...

12:42.078 --> 12:43.669
Thank you very much,
Uncle Robert.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.765
Yeah. You are so welcome.

12:46.916 --> 12:48.249
And, uh, Owen.

12:48.660 --> 12:51.995
You are going to open this
bottle before I leave, right?

12:52.013 --> 12:53.162
-OWEN: No.
-Yes. Open it.

12:53.181 --> 12:55.190
This is going into my safe.

12:56.668 --> 12:59.319
(monitor beeping)

13:00.005 --> 13:01.112
GRACE: Hey, Lexi.

13:01.189 --> 13:02.572
Um, it's Grace.

13:03.432 --> 13:04.431
From 9-1-1.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.617
Oh, my God, you...

13:06.787 --> 13:08.528
You came to see me?

13:08.622 --> 13:10.530
I did, yeah.

13:10.624 --> 13:11.948
These are for you.

13:13.018 --> 13:15.109
Nobody ever gave me
flowers before.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.370
They're beautiful, thank you.

13:17.446 --> 13:19.088
You're welcome.

13:19.916 --> 13:22.091
I thought I was gonna die.

13:23.286 --> 13:26.045
But your voice kept me alive.

13:26.197 --> 13:28.473
(indistinct PA announcement)

13:29.868 --> 13:31.184
Sweetheart.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.294
The doctors say, uh,

13:33.371 --> 13:35.980
whoever... cut me open

13:36.132 --> 13:37.982
took one of my kidneys.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.227
Now I have a, an infection
in my blood.

13:41.971 --> 13:44.531
Do you have any family
you can call, Lexi?

13:45.550 --> 13:46.658
Not really.

13:46.809 --> 13:49.828
My stepfather is in Alabama,

13:49.979 --> 13:53.480
but he's-he's
part of why I ran away.

13:54.150 --> 13:57.151
And besides, he'd just tell me
that I got what I deserved

13:57.170 --> 13:59.653
for... meeting a stranger.

14:00.565 --> 14:02.823
Lexi, what's the last thing
that you remember

14:02.901 --> 14:04.634
before you woke up
in that motel?

14:05.494 --> 14:06.419
LEXI: Um...

14:07.163 --> 14:11.057
I was gonna meet
a date from Bash.

14:11.743 --> 14:13.000
Mike.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.169
We-we've been talking
for a couple of days

14:15.188 --> 14:18.097
and, uh, he has a job
that takes him all over.

14:18.249 --> 14:20.249
So he was here only
in Austin...

14:20.251 --> 14:22.861
(deep inhale, exhale)
for a couple hours.

14:23.421 --> 14:28.032
And he, he asked me to meet him
at a bar near the airport.

14:28.109 --> 14:30.368
And he called me Sweet Angel.

14:33.656 --> 14:35.598
Bash...

14:35.617 --> 14:37.375
I don't think I've ever
heard of that place.

14:37.526 --> 14:39.435
-Where is it?
-LEXI: Oh, no.

14:39.938 --> 14:42.422
It's not a place.
It's a dating app.

14:44.959 --> 14:47.010
Am I gonna go to jail?

14:47.721 --> 14:49.888
Sweetheart, no.

14:49.964 --> 14:52.039
Why would you think
you're going to jail?

14:52.058 --> 14:55.435
Well, those officers,
they didn't believe me.

14:56.621 --> 14:58.638
They asked me
how much I got for it.

14:59.048 --> 15:01.065
How much you got for what?

15:01.884 --> 15:03.568
My kidney.

15:03.719 --> 15:05.528
(ominous music playing)

15:06.798 --> 15:07.813
NURSE:
I'm sorry to interrupt.

15:07.890 --> 15:09.073
There's a detective here

15:09.225 --> 15:11.467
who would like
to speak with Lexi.

15:11.894 --> 15:14.579
(beeping,
indistinct PA announcement)

15:14.989 --> 15:16.331
Detective?

15:17.325 --> 15:18.324
McGregor.

15:18.701 --> 15:21.586
I'm Grace Ryder, uh,
from Austin Emergency Services.

15:21.737 --> 15:22.995
I took this 9-1-1 call.

15:23.148 --> 15:25.072
You always follow up
in person, Ms. Ryder?

15:25.091 --> 15:28.151
Not always, but I felt like
she could use a friend.

15:28.169 --> 15:30.987
And... evidently I was right

15:31.414 --> 15:33.823
because apparently the officers
that took her initial statement

15:33.825 --> 15:37.009
treated her more like a suspect
instead of a victim.

15:37.162 --> 15:39.178
It is possible to be both.

15:39.330 --> 15:40.438
What does that mean?

15:40.665 --> 15:42.941
Organ selling is a crime,
Ms. Ryder.

15:43.017 --> 15:44.258
Even if it's your own.

15:44.260 --> 15:45.944
You really think
she volunteered herself

15:46.020 --> 15:47.261
to be brutalized

15:47.280 --> 15:49.447
and left alone to die
in a cheap motel room?

15:49.524 --> 15:50.782
McGREGOR:
I think it's likely
that she made a deal

15:50.951 --> 15:54.527
with some very shady people
and got in over her head.

15:54.603 --> 15:56.103
Somebody lured her out.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.448
Uh, the jet-setting "Mike"
she met online?

15:59.960 --> 16:01.626
He doesn't exist.

16:02.704 --> 16:04.704
We checked her
online activity.

16:04.780 --> 16:06.038
There's no history of a match

16:06.191 --> 16:08.374
with anyone
calling himself "Mike."

16:08.526 --> 16:10.359
He could have
easily deleted his account.

16:11.196 --> 16:13.529
She said that they met up
at a bar near the airport.

16:13.531 --> 16:15.289
Bar she can't
remember the name of.

16:15.366 --> 16:17.458
Maybe because
she was roofied, Detective?

16:17.535 --> 16:18.810
She was sedated, yeah.

16:18.961 --> 16:21.037
But that's what happens when you
have your kidney removed.

16:21.055 --> 16:21.980
It was stolen from her.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.299
Well, we found an envelope
with $1,500 in cash

16:25.318 --> 16:27.443
on the nightstand
in her motel room.

16:29.397 --> 16:31.138
She didn't tell you
that part, did she?

16:31.716 --> 16:34.884
Okay, so then I'll ask you,
Detective,

16:34.886 --> 16:36.494
since you are
the professional...

16:37.163 --> 16:40.164
would you sell your kidney
for $1,500?

16:40.241 --> 16:42.058
I've seen runaways
do a lot worse

16:42.076 --> 16:43.743
for a lot less
just to survive.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.911
I know that's not
what you wanna hear,

16:45.988 --> 16:48.489
but all I can do is
follow the evidence

16:48.508 --> 16:49.749
wherever it takes me.

16:49.901 --> 16:51.175
GRACE:
Detective, I think maybe

16:51.252 --> 16:53.402
you're just seeing
what you wanna see.

16:53.421 --> 16:54.754
And I think you should
let the police

16:54.997 --> 16:57.265
handle the police work
and stick to answering
the phone.

Just some men?

17:35.129 --> 17:37.129
I created
a fake dating profile

17:37.206 --> 17:38.447
on the same app
that Lexi was using

Lexi gave to me.

17:46.048 --> 17:47.714
Uh, nobody's called me
Sweet Angel

17:47.734 --> 17:49.959
like they have to her.

17:49.977 --> 17:50.793
She's gotten some
"Hey, gorgeous'es"

17:50.812 --> 17:52.052
and a few other things

17:52.221 --> 17:54.322

in front of the baby.

Are you seriously
using your real picture?

18:15.077 --> 18:17.762
I also used a fake name,
so it's not a big deal.

18:17.872 --> 18:18.930
Baby, it's a big deal.

18:19.081 --> 18:21.006
They gut that girl
like a fish

18:21.159 --> 18:22.767
and then they
left her for dead.

18:22.844 --> 18:23.843
That's a big deal.

18:23.919 --> 18:25.177
And nobody
gives a damn about it.

18:25.330 --> 18:28.088
Do I have to remind you
that you got Charlie now?

18:28.166 --> 18:29.923
Why would you
risk doing that?

18:29.943 --> 18:32.276
Because I have Charlie,
sweetheart.

18:32.687 --> 18:33.945
If Lexi
was a cute white girl,

18:34.096 --> 18:37.097
she would be plastered
all over the news right now.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.025
But just like so many other
Black and Brown women,

18:40.102 --> 18:42.120
Lexi has not only
been victimized,

18:42.271 --> 18:45.498
she has been forgotten about
and she has been blamed.

18:46.701 --> 18:48.793
Women who look just like
Charlie will one day.

18:48.944 --> 18:52.037
That... that's why
I'm doing this.

18:52.190 --> 18:54.340
(solemn music playing)

18:58.621 --> 18:59.879
Well, I...

19:00.031 --> 19:01.264
(exhales)

19:04.552 --> 19:06.126
I can appreciate that.

19:07.463 --> 19:11.465
I don't think the answer is
to use your own life as bait.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.634
So the answer is what then,
sweetheart?

19:13.711 --> 19:18.447
When there are so many people
in this system who don't care.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.159
Find the people who do.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.409
She's got a lot on her plate.

19:30.486 --> 19:31.652
She does.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.580
And believe me
when I tell you she gives
a damn about all of 'em.

19:35.324 --> 19:38.259
Which is why sometimes she can
come off a little prickly.

19:38.994 --> 19:40.011
And scowly.

19:40.087 --> 19:41.737
Okay.
She sounds terrifying.

19:41.830 --> 19:42.829
She kind of is.

19:42.907 --> 19:44.423
(door shuts)

19:44.500 --> 19:45.850
Mrs. Ryder.

19:46.001 --> 19:48.260
-Sarina Washington.
-Oh, yeah.

19:48.413 --> 19:51.505
Thank you, um,
for agreeing to see me,
Detective Washington.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.857
Sarina works just fine.

19:53.008 --> 19:56.252
Officer Reyes tells me
that you wanna discuss a case?

19:56.270 --> 19:58.512
I'm actually here
about Lexi Briggs.

19:58.589 --> 20:01.924
I, uh, spoke to
your colleague first,
Detective McGregor.

20:01.926 --> 20:05.277
And he seems convinced that
Lexi sold her own body part

20:05.780 --> 20:08.097
and now he's considering
charging her with a crime.

20:08.099 --> 20:09.598
It does happen, Mrs. Ryder.

20:09.767 --> 20:11.767
GRACE:
But I don't think that was
the case here, Detective.

20:11.786 --> 20:15.129
Lexi was a victim,
and she wasn't the only one.

20:17.366 --> 20:19.217
These are all 9-1-1 transcripts
and police reports

20:19.368 --> 20:21.293
of similar attacks
in the last two years.

20:21.370 --> 20:24.280
All the victims are
women of color,
just like Lexi,

20:24.282 --> 20:26.615
who were lured in
by a dating app.

20:26.634 --> 20:29.876
Drugged, operated on,
only to be ignored.

20:29.954 --> 20:31.303
Just like Lexi.

20:31.973 --> 20:33.289
These are all
from out of state.

20:33.291 --> 20:34.807
GRACE:
That's because
whoever's doing this,

20:34.959 --> 20:37.126
I don't think they're staying
in one place for too long.

20:37.128 --> 20:39.979
You are aware that
my beat is missing persons.

20:40.131 --> 20:41.906
Lexi Briggs isn't missing.

20:41.983 --> 20:43.574
No, but her kidney is.

20:44.560 --> 20:49.080
I don't generally locate folks
piece by piece, Officer Reyes.

20:49.156 --> 20:50.581
GRACE:
How about the man

20:50.658 --> 20:53.325
who's currently in possession
of said kidney?

20:53.419 --> 20:54.660
I'm listening.

20:54.737 --> 20:56.087
CARLOS: Yesterday,
a car that was stolen

20:56.314 --> 20:59.239
out of New Orleans was involved
in a hit-and-run on Alvarado.

20:59.259 --> 21:02.167
The driver abandoned it,
fled the scene,

21:02.244 --> 21:04.428
but he's still at large,
but there was a passenger.

21:05.006 --> 21:07.172
The passenger was rescued
by first responders.

21:07.249 --> 21:09.341
Then he assaulted a paramedic
and also fled.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.084
Also still at large.

21:11.162 --> 21:12.828
And the paramedic captain
who treated him,

21:12.847 --> 21:16.181
she believed that she saw signs
of a recent transplant surgery.

21:16.276 --> 21:19.335
So he'd have a reason to run,
if he could run.

21:19.353 --> 21:22.071
I can't imagine he got very far,
not without some help.

21:23.341 --> 21:26.284
I must say, you do make
a very compelling case.

21:28.179 --> 21:30.788
So... I'm sorry, Detective.
You believe us?

21:30.939 --> 21:32.348
Why wouldn't I?

21:32.350 --> 21:33.182
(Carlos chuckles)

21:33.184 --> 21:35.293
You said she was terrifying.

21:36.020 --> 21:37.520
I did not say that.
I didn't say that.

21:37.522 --> 21:40.022
I personally think that
we should start searching

21:40.024 --> 21:41.299
on the national transplant
waitlist,

21:41.375 --> 21:43.116
because I think he was
on it at some point.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.193
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.
(chuckles)

21:44.211 --> 21:46.195
Mrs. Ryder,
I said I believe you.

21:46.213 --> 21:48.222
I did not say I could help you.

21:49.625 --> 21:50.791
Why the hell not?

21:50.810 --> 21:52.034
SARINA WASHINGTON:
It's not my case.

21:52.127 --> 21:55.062
You have to talk
to the detective in charge.

21:56.482 --> 21:57.690
(sighs)

22:01.637 --> 22:02.653
(scoffs)

22:03.064 --> 22:04.322
Well... (clears throat)

22:04.473 --> 22:06.882
Looks like you got
the whole thing figured out.

22:06.901 --> 22:08.159
I don't know why I bother.

22:08.235 --> 22:09.234
Never said that.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.387
Brian, nobody is
questioning your work.

22:11.389 --> 22:13.389
-Really?
-SARINA: Or your commitment.

22:13.391 --> 22:15.366
But there does seem
to be a pattern here

22:15.518 --> 22:17.293
that could use a harder look.

22:19.580 --> 22:20.579
Fine.

22:20.731 --> 22:22.398
You want this
crap sandwich, Sarina?

22:22.400 --> 22:24.842
You don't just take a bite,
you get the whole thing.

22:24.993 --> 22:26.260
(Sarina scoffs)

22:28.831 --> 22:30.848
Knock yourselves out.

22:30.999 --> 22:33.100
I got enough
on my plate anyway.

22:33.669 --> 22:34.668
SARINA: Alright.

22:34.745 --> 22:36.336
And I'll assume
that you won't be

22:36.414 --> 22:38.597
bringing any charges
against Lexi Briggs.

22:39.174 --> 22:41.359
At least until I can go
through all of this.

22:41.510 --> 22:44.052
McGREGOR: (sighs)
Well, you don't gotta
worry about that.

22:44.513 --> 22:47.239
I never bring charges
against a dead person.

22:49.427 --> 22:50.368
What?

22:52.205 --> 22:54.688
Yeah. Lexi Briggs died
in the hospital

22:54.765 --> 22:56.457
about an hour ago.

22:57.359 --> 22:58.117
(exhales)

22:58.527 --> 22:59.935
JUDD (over phone):
<i> I'm so sorry.</i>

23:00.380 --> 23:03.047
They haven't even
been able to... (sharp inhale)

23:03.124 --> 23:05.591
to get a hold of her stepdad
to notify him.

23:06.460 --> 23:07.960
Wow, that's terrible.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.613
GRACE (over phone):
<i> You should have</i>
<i> seen her at the hospital.</i>

23:10.965 --> 23:12.747
She was very scared.

23:12.749 --> 23:14.967
And she was... by herself.

23:15.119 --> 23:17.228
-(sniffles)
-JUDD:<i> Gracie.</i>

23:19.899 --> 23:21.790
You sound weary, honey.

23:21.792 --> 23:23.475
GRACE:<i> I am. I am.</i>

23:23.628 --> 23:26.570
I am weary, Judd.
I'm weary to my soul.

23:27.314 --> 23:28.480
JUDD:
<i> Well, I'll tell you what.</i>

23:28.633 --> 23:29.982
I'm taking
the rest of the shift off

23:30.134 --> 23:31.575
<i> and I'm gonna</i>
<i> come pick you up.</i>

23:31.727 --> 23:34.653
No, it's okay.
You don't have to do that.

23:34.730 --> 23:36.305
<i> I can't leave yet.</i>

23:36.732 --> 23:39.065
<i> Not when we have so much</i>
<i> work to do. Not when...</i>

23:39.752 --> 23:42.645
the monsters who hurt her
are still out there.

23:42.663 --> 23:43.963
I just...

23:44.498 --> 23:45.589
I can't leave.

23:45.816 --> 23:46.982
JUDD:
<i> Alright, well,</i>

23:47.168 --> 23:49.910
I reckon you best go get
those sons of bitches then, huh?

23:50.430 --> 23:52.430
Yeah, I reckon so.
(sniffles)

23:52.581 --> 23:53.656
I love you.

23:53.674 --> 23:55.324
You promise
to take care of yourself.

23:55.843 --> 23:57.393
I love you, too.
Thank you.

23:59.664 --> 24:02.164
SARINA:
We've been combing through
the transplant waitlist

24:02.166 --> 24:03.757
and wanted to see
if anyone looked like

24:03.776 --> 24:05.684
your fugitive kidney patient.

24:05.686 --> 24:07.002
Can you guys
see these okay?

24:07.004 --> 24:09.171
Yeah, babe,
we-we can see everything.

24:09.190 --> 24:11.190
It's just...
none of those are the guy.

24:11.266 --> 24:13.617
-How about this?
-TOMMY (over phone):<i> No.</i>

24:13.769 --> 24:14.935
No, keep going.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.345
TK (over phone):<i> No.</i>

24:16.347 --> 24:18.956
TOMMY:<i> No, not them.</i>

24:19.107 --> 24:22.609
Wait, wait, wait.
Grace, can you go back
to that last guy?

24:22.628 --> 24:24.295
Mm-hmm. Him?

24:25.447 --> 24:26.464
Yeah.

24:27.467 --> 24:28.466
(knock on door)

24:31.529 --> 24:32.711
Uh, can I help you?

24:32.863 --> 24:36.031
Mrs. Harris,
Detective Washington,
Austin PD.

24:36.050 --> 24:38.050
We'd like to have a few words
with your husband, Clint.

24:38.126 --> 24:40.869
Uh, Clint's on
a business trip
to Albuquerque

24:40.871 --> 24:41.887
for the rest of the week.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.129
Can I ask what this is about?

24:43.149 --> 24:45.224
I'm pretty sure you know
what this is about.

24:45.300 --> 24:47.893
Your husband was involved
in a car accident yesterday.

24:47.970 --> 24:50.488
He assaulted a paramedic
while fleeing the incident.

24:50.639 --> 24:52.548
We also believe
he recently received

24:52.550 --> 24:54.383
a kidney
off the black market.

24:54.385 --> 24:55.734
Like I said, he's not here,

24:55.828 --> 24:57.620
so you'll have to come back
another time.

24:58.723 --> 24:59.980
Captain Vega,

25:00.558 --> 25:02.391
would you please explain
what would happen to her husband

25:02.393 --> 25:04.727
if he doesn't receive
immediate medical attention?

25:04.820 --> 25:06.078
Given his condition,

25:06.230 --> 25:08.339
I'd say the kidney
wasn't a proper match,

25:08.415 --> 25:10.232
which means
his body is rejecting it.

25:10.234 --> 25:13.677
Soon he'll go into sepsis,
if he hasn't already.

25:13.754 --> 25:18.098
After that, total organ failure,
and then he dies.

25:18.500 --> 25:19.258
(gasps)

25:19.519 --> 25:22.478
Back den. To your left.
Please help him.

25:24.840 --> 25:27.066
(Clint groaning)

25:28.343 --> 25:30.586
TK, LifePak.
Nancy, get his temperature.

25:30.588 --> 25:31.529
Yeah, Cap.

25:33.682 --> 25:35.774
He's burning up, Cap.
His temperature's 103.

25:35.851 --> 25:37.701
His BP is 180 over 110.

25:37.853 --> 25:38.594
It must be septic shock.

25:38.612 --> 25:39.870
Alright, radio West Park,

25:40.039 --> 25:42.188
tell 'em that they better
have everybody standing by.

25:42.266 --> 25:44.500
Alright, let's go.
We gotta move him now.

25:50.532 --> 25:51.882
(machines beeping)

25:52.034 --> 25:54.635
-Any updates on Harris?
-Still in surgery.

25:58.391 --> 26:01.875
Um... how many sugars
did you put in here?

26:01.894 --> 26:03.710
Two and a half packets,
plus a Stevia.

26:03.729 --> 26:06.546
-Too much?
-No, it's perfect.

26:06.566 --> 26:08.807
How did you know exactly
how I take my coffee?

26:09.460 --> 26:11.810
Saw you make it
back at the station.

26:11.887 --> 26:13.386
So you were observing me?

26:13.464 --> 26:15.239
Observing
makes it sound creepy.

26:15.316 --> 26:16.240
It is a little creepy,

26:16.558 --> 26:18.634
but you have a detective's eye,
Officer Reyes.

26:18.652 --> 26:19.910
Thank you.

26:20.137 --> 26:23.305
You know, I recall sitting
in this very same hospital

26:23.324 --> 26:26.750
on another case
encouraging you to take
the detective's exam.

26:26.827 --> 26:28.234
I thought about it.

26:28.829 --> 26:31.046
So why didn't you
see it through?

26:31.924 --> 26:33.740
Because I became
a police officer

26:33.818 --> 26:36.076
to help my community.

26:36.153 --> 26:38.578
I'd rather be on patrol
trying to prevent problems

26:38.598 --> 26:42.057
than just picking up the pieces
after the damage is done.

26:42.843 --> 26:44.751
Hmm. I can respect that.

26:45.346 --> 26:49.348
But not every evil can be
spotted from a patrol car.

26:49.424 --> 26:52.610
Sometimes you gotta
follow 'em down a snake hole.

26:53.020 --> 26:56.363
Especially when you
have a gift for it.

27:00.511 --> 27:01.619
Damn, girl.

27:02.104 --> 27:04.104
It feels like there's
steel cables in there.

27:04.515 --> 27:06.698
Yeah, it's... It's been a week.

27:06.775 --> 27:07.866
Hmm. I'll say.

27:08.276 --> 27:10.628
Well, the worst part's
behind you now

27:10.704 --> 27:11.778
and you can exhale.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.523
-Which you still ain't done.
-GRACE: Mm-mm.

27:15.301 --> 27:18.618
I can't help but feel like
this job is half done.

27:18.696 --> 27:20.045
Babe, what are you
talking about?

27:20.139 --> 27:23.215
You helped catch the guy that
stole that little girl's kidney.

27:23.291 --> 27:25.717
No, he didn't
steal her kidney.

27:25.870 --> 27:27.886
He had it,
but he wasn't the one

27:27.963 --> 27:29.554
that-that lured her out
or cut her open.

27:29.631 --> 27:32.040
Okay, no.
No, but when he wakes up,

27:32.042 --> 27:33.484
he's gonna lead us
to the ones who did.

27:33.560 --> 27:34.910
If he wakes up.

27:34.912 --> 27:36.362
Grace, look at me.

27:37.047 --> 27:38.471
You did your bit.

27:38.899 --> 27:40.473
Well, I appreciate you
saying so.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.719
And I appreciate you guys
lettin' me stop by.

27:44.312 --> 27:47.014
I should probably go ahead
and take Charlie off
Mom and Dad's hands.

27:47.090 --> 27:48.557
Why don't you just
leave her there tonight?

27:48.559 --> 27:51.243
What? No, I can't do that
to them with no notice.

27:51.395 --> 27:53.412
You don't do it to 'em.
They love having
their grandbaby over.

27:53.564 --> 27:56.398
You know, you need to go home.
You need to rest.

27:56.400 --> 27:59.568
You need to put your feet up,
play some video games.

27:59.586 --> 28:01.679
It ain't healthy to walk around
with that much tension

28:01.830 --> 28:02.754
in your shoulders like that.

28:02.831 --> 28:03.997
Ain't that right?

28:04.074 --> 28:05.165
Oh, as a medical
professional?

28:05.184 --> 28:06.684
-JUDD: Uh-huh.
-Yes, I must insist.

28:06.835 --> 28:08.668
(sighs) Well, you know,
a quiet night

28:08.746 --> 28:10.396
does sound pretty nice.

28:13.100 --> 28:15.918
Mr. Harris,
I'm Detective Washington.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.769
This is Officer Reyes.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.104
We know you didn't receive

28:19.181 --> 28:21.031
that kidney through
legitimate channels.

28:21.108 --> 28:22.866
We need the names
of the individuals

28:23.018 --> 28:24.368
that provided it to you.

28:25.262 --> 28:28.113
They said they'd kill me
if I ever talked to the police.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.709
I think I'd rather face
a few years in prison
than face them.

28:31.785 --> 28:34.878
Oh, you're looking at a lot
more than just a few years.

28:34.955 --> 28:38.531
I know the punishment
for buying an organ.

28:38.551 --> 28:40.718
"A fine that shall
not exceed $50,000

28:40.869 --> 28:42.035
and five years in prison."

28:42.054 --> 28:43.779
How about the punishment
for accessory to murder?

28:43.797 --> 28:45.389
(dramatic sting)

28:46.392 --> 28:47.391
Murder?

28:47.468 --> 28:49.542
Lexi Briggs,
your unwitting donor.

28:49.562 --> 28:51.636
She was drugged and had
her kidney stolen from her.

28:52.306 --> 28:54.790
She died of complications
from the surgery.

28:54.808 --> 28:55.807
CLINT HARRIS: Stolen?

28:55.901 --> 28:57.642
They-they said that the donors

28:57.795 --> 28:58.977
were all on the same page.

28:59.054 --> 29:01.054
They-they said
that they willingly

29:01.131 --> 29:02.740
sold the kidney for $60,000.

29:02.816 --> 29:04.074
And everybody was safe.

29:04.243 --> 29:07.319
Lexi woke up in a bathtub
full of ice in a cheap motel

29:07.471 --> 29:09.654
with $1,500 on the nightstand.

29:10.140 --> 29:12.124
She was 21 years old.

29:13.477 --> 29:14.460
Oh, my God.

29:16.647 --> 29:18.130
Oh, my God. No.

29:18.832 --> 29:20.649
That poor girl. I...

29:20.834 --> 29:23.093
I would never have gone through
with this if I'd known.

29:23.245 --> 29:25.320
Then prove it to us
by helping us

29:25.339 --> 29:27.080

of the trafficking ring.

30:11.702 --> 30:14.812
You really think these guys
could be using a dentist office

30:14.963 --> 30:17.064
to perform organ transplants?

30:17.558 --> 30:18.723
Makes sense.

30:18.800 --> 30:21.151
Got the office space,
a lot of the equipment.

38:04.265 --> 38:05.765
Well, his breathing's labored,

38:05.767 --> 38:07.099
but that's to be expected.

38:07.177 --> 38:08.768
When can I take
this guy to jail?

38:08.845 --> 38:10.603
Uh, it might be a minute.
I'm guessing our Cap's

38:10.680 --> 38:12.289
gonna wanna transport him
to the hospital,

38:12.365 --> 38:14.440
but you're more than welcome
to ride with us.

38:49.977 --> 38:51.328

38:51.663 --> 38:54.331

Alright, well, yeah,
there wasn't a fire.

39:43.382 --> 39:46.049
Detective, let-let me just say

39:46.200 --> 39:48.534
The next time my wife

39:48.628 --> 39:49.719
you better listen to her.

Yes, I'm starting to see that.

-Well, don't just start.
-Judd.

39:53.875 --> 39:56.134
He listened to me tonight,
okay?

39:56.286 --> 39:58.228
And as somebody
that listens for a living,

39:58.730 --> 40:01.231
I do think that's a skill
that can be learned.

40:01.307 --> 40:02.214
