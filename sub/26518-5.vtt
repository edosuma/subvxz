WEBVTT

00:09.576 --> 00:10.677
Let her go!

00:15.215 --> 00:17.050
This is not how I pictured
seeing you again.

00:17.050 --> 00:18.619
Yeah?
Maybe you don't know me

00:18.619 --> 00:21.088
as well as you thought.
Now drop it.

00:21.088 --> 00:22.356
Or what?

00:22.356 --> 00:23.690
You're gonna shoot me?

00:23.690 --> 00:24.892
If I have to.

00:24.892 --> 00:28.295
Or you can drop the gun,

00:28.295 --> 00:30.430
and we can have
a conversation.

00:40.340 --> 00:41.675
Well, that was fun.

00:48.115 --> 00:49.383
What do you want?

00:49.383 --> 00:52.052
Just your access
to the FBI servers.

00:57.257 --> 00:58.425
That's not gonna happen.

00:58.425 --> 01:00.861
Oh, it'll happen.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.496
It's just a matter of how.

01:11.705 --> 01:17.077
Now, which should
we use first

01:29.222 --> 01:30.724
Here.

01:30.724 --> 01:33.560
Blueprints to all the CIA's
domestic black sites.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.896
Shepherd could be
in any one of the five sites

01:35.896 --> 01:37.130
on the Eastern seaboard.

01:37.130 --> 01:38.532
We still need to find
which one.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.600
I mean, easy enough
to say, but--

01:40.600 --> 01:42.869
This is what
I'm paying you for.

01:42.869 --> 01:44.404
I'll work
my connections, too.

01:46.106 --> 01:50.610
What?
Someone from the U.S. Marshals
looked into me, Allison Knight.

01:50.610 --> 01:51.912
You know her?

01:51.912 --> 01:53.780
Allie Knight, U.S. Marshals.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.282
Clearly you do.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.650
Your friend has
a photo of me

01:56.650 --> 01:58.118
from the night
we met in Dumbo.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.653
Weller must've tailed me.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.189
I'd be more than happy
to take care of him.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.491
It'll look like an accident.

02:04.491 --> 02:07.661
No, no,
I still need him alive.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.231
I can get him
under control.

02:19.506 --> 02:20.807
All right.

02:22.342 --> 02:25.278
Now, this can be very easy
or very, very difficult.

02:25.278 --> 02:26.947
Look, you want to talk,
let's talk.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.049
Whatever's going on with you,
whatever happened,

02:29.049 --> 02:30.183
we can figure this out.

02:30.183 --> 02:31.818
She's not on your side
anymore.

02:34.221 --> 02:36.423
Now, what's the password?

02:38.225 --> 02:40.761
All right.
All right!

02:40.761 --> 02:42.729
E...

02:44.664 --> 02:47.501
...A-T...

02:47.501 --> 02:48.535
S-H.

02:48.535 --> 02:50.237
Is this funny to you?

02:50.237 --> 02:51.471
No, it isn't.

02:51.471 --> 02:53.473
But this isn't you.
We both know that.

02:53.473 --> 02:54.741
But I can't help you
unless you--

03:00.047 --> 03:01.214
What are you doing?

03:01.214 --> 03:02.516
We want the same thing.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.617
I just wanted
the smart way.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.152
The hell's that
supposed to mean?

03:05.152 --> 03:07.888
You had a scalding hot fork
inches from his face.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.723
If he'd screamed, we'd be
dealing with neighbors

03:09.723 --> 03:11.491
and cops right now.
Please.

03:11.491 --> 03:14.061
I was going to gag him before
we got to the good part.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.763
In and out,
that's the plan.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.067
What, you're gonna hack it
yourself now?

03:20.067 --> 03:21.468
No, I'm buying us time.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.070
I'll break him
when he comes to.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.638
One of us will.

03:31.678 --> 03:33.313
Good morning.

03:33.313 --> 03:34.815
Whoa, you're here early.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.850
It's like you have
Jane-related ESP or something.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.552
I literally just learned
about this.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.253
You learned about what?

03:40.253 --> 03:41.655
Did you find a treatment?

03:41.655 --> 03:43.590
Please... don't get
your hopes up.

03:43.590 --> 03:47.027
There's an experimental
stem-cell therapy.

03:47.027 --> 03:49.763
It's still in trials
and not everybody is eligible.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.766
Okay, so we make Jane
eligible.

03:52.766 --> 03:55.001
This isn't like
a wait-list thing, Kurt.

03:55.001 --> 03:56.803
Jane has to be a match,

03:56.803 --> 04:00.373
and the test for compatibility
is like a spinal tap...

04:00.373 --> 04:02.676
only a lot more painful.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.444
That is what you came here
to talk about, right?

04:04.444 --> 04:06.379
Yeah. Also...

04:06.379 --> 04:09.416
I need you to look
into this woman for me.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.986
Her name is Violet Park.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.154
What's this for?

04:14.154 --> 04:16.423
It's for Allie.
It's a favor.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.959
Okay,
I'll see what I can do.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.561
And can we keep this
between... ourselves?

04:21.561 --> 04:24.097
Allie doesn't know that I'm
looking into it for her.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.699
Thank you.

04:27.234 --> 04:28.468
Is there anything else
going on here

04:28.468 --> 04:30.003
that I should know about?

04:30.003 --> 04:31.972
No.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.607
At least, I hope not.

04:40.247 --> 04:42.516
Wow... your hair.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.618
I did it myself.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.586
Just feels more like me.

04:46.586 --> 04:47.854
Do you like it?

04:47.854 --> 04:48.855
I love it.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.226
And I love that,

04:53.226 --> 04:55.662
but we should
keep it professional,

04:55.662 --> 04:57.030
Agent Doe.

04:58.365 --> 04:59.733
I didn't miss
a team meeting, did I?

04:59.733 --> 05:03.003
No, uh, I was just
talking to Patterson.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.305
There's a procedure.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.474
It's a long shot,

05:07.474 --> 05:10.310
but it might be a possible
cure to your condition.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.711
What?

05:11.711 --> 05:14.681
But we have to see
if you're a match first.

05:14.681 --> 05:17.784
From what I gather,
the test...

05:17.784 --> 05:19.920
is not gonna
feel very good.

05:21.221 --> 05:22.389
You and I can just run.

05:22.389 --> 05:23.890
No, I can't.

05:23.890 --> 05:25.926
I have no choice but to keep
working with these people

05:25.926 --> 05:28.128
until we recover the rest
of your data caches

05:28.128 --> 05:29.196
and find the cure.

05:29.196 --> 05:31.565
I'll do it.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.066
Look, I'll do anything

05:33.066 --> 05:35.001
if it might give us
more time together.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.377
We got a hit on Jane's
scythe tattoo.

05:44.377 --> 05:45.879
We're not waiting for Reade?

05:45.879 --> 05:47.280
Edgar will not be joining
us today.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.149
He's out sick.
He e-mailed.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.717
What, you're gonna
hack it yourself?

05:50.717 --> 05:52.485
No, I'm buying us time.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.487
Catching up on Netflix.
Mm, excuse me.

05:54.487 --> 05:58.725
You were saying?
Uh, yes,
so on your left calf

05:58.725 --> 06:00.460
is an outline of a scythe.

06:00.460 --> 06:01.862
A Grim Reaper,
which is fitting

06:01.862 --> 06:03.363
because it happens
to be the nom de plume

06:03.363 --> 06:04.931
of a very prolific
assassin.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.700
We've been chasing
"The Scythe" for years.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.201
He's killed
on six continents.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.137
And we've never been able
to I.D. him until today.

06:11.137 --> 06:14.174
Roman added a cluster of dots
imbedded in the tattoo.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.976
We could never figure out
their significance.

06:15.976 --> 06:19.246
Until this handsome fellow
landed at JFK this morning.

06:19.246 --> 06:20.714
Meet Luther VanLax.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.816
Make that swipe right
on that, am I right?

06:22.816 --> 06:25.352
Yes, Daddy.
You don't get it.

06:25.352 --> 06:28.088
His facial rec pattern
is an exact match

06:28.088 --> 06:29.756
for the dots
on Jane's leg.

06:29.756 --> 06:32.125
So Roman was telling us that
Luther VanLax is "The Scythe."

06:32.125 --> 06:34.594
In other words,
we just found a ghost.

06:34.594 --> 06:36.096
Briefly.
Unfortunately,

06:36.096 --> 06:38.031
by the time my database
confirmed the match,

06:38.031 --> 06:40.333
Luther was already
MIA again.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.901
If this guy has killed
internationally,

06:41.901 --> 06:43.770
we should bring in Keaton
on this.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.172
Shepherd could be in
any one of the five sites.

06:46.172 --> 06:47.240
We need to find which one.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.642
I'll work my connections, too.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.777
The CIA could have intel
we don't.

06:51.878 --> 06:54.781
Great.
Let's bring in Mr. Fun.

06:54.781 --> 06:56.983
Think he'll wear khaki?

06:58.318 --> 06:59.886
Brilliant plan, Tasha.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.554
Your little friend's
still out.

07:01.554 --> 07:03.623
Do you know how much time
you've just cost us?

07:03.623 --> 07:05.692
I will call the boss
and explain what happened.

07:05.692 --> 07:07.794
No. You should've just let me
torture him.

07:07.794 --> 07:10.930
It wouldn't have worked.
Reade is too strong for that.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.832
We need to use what's
important to him.

07:12.832 --> 07:15.935
Suddenly you're
the interrogation expert?

07:15.935 --> 07:18.538
I'm ex-CIA.
It's kind of our thing.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.107
And I know him better
than you.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.976
Which is why
you should stand down.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.512
You are way too close to this
for my comfort.

07:25.512 --> 07:28.315
Yeah?

07:28.315 --> 07:30.483
We had a little hiccup.

07:30.483 --> 07:31.651
No, I--

07:31.651 --> 07:33.586
We can still get it,
we just--

07:33.586 --> 07:35.889
I understand completely.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.461
We have two hours.
Or what?

07:41.461 --> 07:42.962
Or JB goes ahead
without us.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.364
And you don't want that,
trust me.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.866
Nap time's over.

07:46.866 --> 07:48.335
What are you gonna do?

07:48.335 --> 07:51.104
Wake him the hell up.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.178
The Scythe's been
on the CIA's radar

07:58.178 --> 08:00.080
since he killed
three of our operatives

08:00.080 --> 08:01.514
in Saudi Arabia in '08.

08:01.514 --> 08:03.016
Any theories on his MO?

08:03.016 --> 08:05.352
After the Saudi murders,
a U.S. oil deal fell through.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.520
So we've always figured
he works for the Russians.

08:07.520 --> 08:08.855
That totally tracks.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.657
A "scythe" is another word
for a sickle.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.159
His name is a shout-out
to the USSR.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.328
And speaking of names,
The Scythe has many.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.765
Here's a list of his aliases
we've compiled over the years.

08:18.765 --> 08:21.501
Okay, so we'll scan
every database

08:21.501 --> 08:23.269
in the tri-state area,

08:23.269 --> 08:25.638
see if we can find
anything that hits.

08:25.638 --> 08:26.973
Oh!

08:26.973 --> 08:28.074
She is that good,
ladies and gentlemen!

08:28.074 --> 08:30.076
What'd you find?
One Luther Dolov

08:30.076 --> 08:32.812
just checked into a lecture
at Clovis Labs.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.514
Clovis Labs dabbles
in everything

08:34.514 --> 08:37.250
from alt energy research
to weapons R&D.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.252
He could be there
to carry out another hit.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.020
Let's move.

08:47.660 --> 08:50.630

Excuse me, Doctor.

Keep your hands

Get on the ground.

09:13.019 --> 09:13.920
You're insane.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.555
Who would choose
to program in PHP?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.090
It's like training
with weights on--

09:17.090 --> 09:19.426
once you take 'em off,
you're like Superman.

09:28.468 --> 09:29.803
You know this guy?

09:29.803 --> 09:31.571
No, I've never met him
before in my life.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.106
You're the reason
I do what I do.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.742
Okay, um...

09:35.742 --> 09:37.877
maybe he has my name
tattooed on his back?

09:39.646 --> 09:42.782

10:06.673 --> 10:08.641
I don't want
to hurt you again.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.644
You got a weird way
of showing it.

10:11.644 --> 10:13.980
As bad as you think I am,
she's worse.

10:16.983 --> 10:20.119
Do us a favor and just
give us the password.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.556
You swore an oath.

10:23.556 --> 10:25.658
You were supposed
to protect people.

10:25.658 --> 10:27.527
Yeah...

10:27.527 --> 10:29.696
but who was
protecting me?

10:31.130 --> 10:35.468
My "sacred oath" clearly
meant nothing to the CIA,

10:35.468 --> 10:36.970
to my country.

Is that what this is?

10:41.541 --> 10:44.644
No, I'm thankful.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.146
It was a wake-up call.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.481
A reminder to look out
for myself.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.616
Everybody else does.

No, not everyone.

Letting a dying man bleed out

that was different.

Who was that protecting?

11:12.872 --> 11:14.941
You think
you're immune?

11:14.941 --> 11:19.112
I went from the NYPD
to the FBI to the CIA,

11:19.112 --> 11:20.947
and you know the only thing
that stayed the same?

11:20.947 --> 11:24.517
Corruption. People serving
and protecting themselves.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.786
And you are no different.

11:26.786 --> 11:28.788
I don't fault you
for it.

11:28.788 --> 11:30.890
You wanted that
Assistant Director job.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.058
And you took it.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.794
Well, now I'm taking
what's mine.

11:34.794 --> 11:36.262
What happened to you?

11:36.262 --> 11:38.164
Why are you working
for Madeline?

11:38.164 --> 11:39.032
The real reason.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.533
I don't know who that is.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.936
So I'm gonna ask you
one more time,

11:42.936 --> 11:45.772
and then I can't help you
anymore.

11:47.206 --> 11:50.944
What... is... the password?

11:59.652 --> 12:00.987
So who do you work for?

12:00.987 --> 12:02.322
The Russians?

12:02.322 --> 12:04.257
Did they order you
to kill Dr. Miller?

12:05.358 --> 12:07.193
I didn't commit any crimes.
Hm.

12:07.193 --> 12:10.964
First-degree murder,
it's a pretty serious crime.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.565
What about your crimes?

12:12.565 --> 12:16.869
Being part of a machine
that allows corporations

12:16.869 --> 12:19.606
to profit while strangling
the land to death?

12:19.606 --> 12:21.641
That's why
you killed her?

12:21.641 --> 12:23.910
For environmental
reasons?

12:23.910 --> 12:26.446
New York is a scourge.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.815
Eight million parasites
always eating,

12:28.815 --> 12:31.317
consuming,
throwing away.

12:31.317 --> 12:34.354
No one thinking about
what it really costs.

12:34.354 --> 12:38.591
But today the feeding
frenzy ends.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.594
Today the parasites burn.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.029
What does that mean,
Luther?

12:45.531 --> 12:48.101
How do you know Rich DotCom?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.235
Who?

12:49.235 --> 12:51.237
The man you saw outside
of the elevator.

12:51.237 --> 12:52.572
Why?

12:52.572 --> 12:54.107
What have you done
to him?

12:54.107 --> 12:56.109
The man I know would never
work for the FBI.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.544
He's so protective.
It's really endearing.

12:58.544 --> 13:00.546
And alarming.

13:00.546 --> 13:02.649
It's just one of the pitfalls
of celebrity, I guess.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.617
Oh, my God, are you sure
you don't recognize this guy?

13:04.617 --> 13:06.586
You think I know this
whack

13:06.586 --> 13:10.590
That man is the seed
from which we are all sewn.

13:10.590 --> 13:14.827
He is the nourishing soil,
he is the sustaining dew,

13:14.827 --> 13:16.095
he is everything.

13:16.095 --> 13:19.165
Okay, that sounded
familiar.

13:19.165 --> 13:20.833
So fun fact about me--

13:20.833 --> 13:22.201
I haven't always been
the great guy

13:22.201 --> 13:23.703
that you know
and love today.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.672
And one of my earlier
entrepreneurial endeavors

13:25.672 --> 13:27.974
appears to have created
some unfortunate ripple effects.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.375
What was the scam, Rich?

13:29.375 --> 13:31.411
I managed to convince
a handful of people

13:31.411 --> 13:32.979
who care very deeply
about the planet

13:32.979 --> 13:35.315
to pay me to offset
their carbon emissions.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.417
So you preyed on
environmentalists?

13:37.417 --> 13:38.584
Only the gullible ones.

13:38.584 --> 13:40.186
I created a website
where people could go

13:40.186 --> 13:41.754
to offset
their carbon footprint

13:41.754 --> 13:43.589
if they ever bought
an "un-eco-friendly" item

13:43.589 --> 13:46.626
like a TV or a cell phone
or, God forbid, a plane ticket.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.828
And they would just pay me
a nominal fee.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.064
And what did you tell them
that you were using
the money for?

13:51.064 --> 13:53.666
You know, planting trees,
cleaning the ocean,

13:53.666 --> 13:54.901
fighting deforestation.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.936
Really important,
necessary work.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.304
Which you weren't
actually doing.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.073
Oh, no, I did not
do it at all.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.607
But I did create a pretty
kick-ass website.

14:04.644 --> 14:05.945
That's your website?

14:05.945 --> 14:07.313
I thought you were
a computer genius?

14:07.313 --> 14:09.048
I remember it being
cooler than this.

14:09.048 --> 14:10.850
But in my defense,
I was drinking

14:10.850 --> 14:12.418
a lot of bathtub gin
in those days.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.222
"Jackson Fernwood."

14:16.222 --> 14:17.957
Explains how Luther
recognized him.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.358
You wrote a manifesto?

14:19.358 --> 14:21.661
Yes.
And that's what Luther
was quoting?

14:21.661 --> 14:24.497
"Nature, the gentlest mother,
impatient of no child,

14:24.497 --> 14:28.067
the feeblest or the waywardest,
Her admonition mild."

14:28.067 --> 14:29.802
Emily Dickinson?

14:29.802 --> 14:31.838
Oh, I have no idea.
It's Dickinson.

14:31.838 --> 14:32.972
Okay, Harvard, jeez.

14:32.972 --> 14:34.207
Yeah.
Wow.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.575
I got tired of writing
all this stuff,

14:35.575 --> 14:37.543
so I wrote a program
to write it for me.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.512
Basically it's an algorithm
that scours the Internet

14:39.512 --> 14:41.114
for anything remotely
ecological,

14:41.114 --> 14:43.716
whips it up,
spits it out as propaganda.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.487
You wrote an artificial
intelligence plagiarism bot.

14:47.487 --> 14:50.022
Yes, I did, and then I got bored
with it and moved on.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.390
Well, apparently
it's still spitting.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.192
And someone has
co-opted this site

14:53.192 --> 14:54.894
to inspire
terrorist attacks.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.963
This just doesn't stop
at Luther.

14:56.963 --> 14:58.264
He said something
today about,

14:58.264 --> 14:59.599
"The New York parasites
will burn."

14:59.599 --> 15:00.933
Something else is coming.

15:00.933 --> 15:04.203
Okay, we'll I.D. anyone
who frequented Rich's site,

15:04.203 --> 15:06.773
or bought carbon offsets.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.040
Jane, we should get going

15:08.040 --> 15:09.776
if we're gonna make
your appointment.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.310
I want to stay and help.

15:11.310 --> 15:14.981
Jane, it's fine.
That's important.

15:14.981 --> 15:17.350
This research is gonna
take us a while.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.453
Okay.

15:26.292 --> 15:28.127
You sure you're up
for this?

15:30.096 --> 15:32.565
If there's even a 1% chance
this could save me,

15:32.565 --> 15:33.933
I gotta try.

15:36.836 --> 15:38.471
But yeah, I'm scared.

15:41.574 --> 15:42.675
Don't be.

15:44.043 --> 15:47.079
You're the strongest person
I know.

15:47.079 --> 15:49.048
You will beat this.

15:50.149 --> 15:51.684
What if I can't?

15:52.985 --> 15:54.353
Hi there.

15:54.353 --> 15:56.589
Okay. Now, I believe
you were made aware

15:56.589 --> 15:58.691
you won't be given any
anesthesia for this procedure.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.661
It interferes with the accuracy
of the examination.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.196
Yeah, I'm aware.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.199
I'll be inserting a needle
into your spinal column

16:06.199 --> 16:07.433
to obtain some fluid.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.402
I'll need you to stay
very still.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.103
You'll feel
a burning sensation

16:11.103 --> 16:12.205
and pressure on
your vertebrae.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.973
And for 24-hours after...

16:13.973 --> 16:15.942
Headaches,
nausea, fatigue.

16:15.942 --> 16:17.210
They told me.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.582
Hey.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.618
Don't look at them.
Look at me.

16:28.054 --> 16:30.556
I'm gonna be here
the whole time.

16:33.759 --> 16:36.095
I'm not gonna ask
you again, Reade.

16:36.095 --> 16:37.630
You said that already.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.432
All right, my turn.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.002
Don't be stupid.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.371
She will torture you.

16:45.371 --> 16:46.873
She doesn't care
about you.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.040
She doesn't
care about me.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.542
She just wants the password.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.215
Was any of it real for you?

17:00.052 --> 17:02.722
It was real for me.

17:04.991 --> 17:07.126
Was this entire
thing a lie?

17:09.962 --> 17:12.131
Did you ever love me?

17:15.101 --> 17:16.569
Yeah.

17:18.004 --> 17:19.705
I've always loved you.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.312
Does that make it better?

17:27.847 --> 17:30.416
Would you rather
that I didn't?

17:30.416 --> 17:32.018
That I'd never
let anyone get close,

17:32.018 --> 17:33.386
and you're no different?

17:35.454 --> 17:38.591
Whatever gets us the password
and out the door,

17:38.591 --> 17:40.393
that's the answer.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.697
Actually,
I think this is.

17:46.832 --> 17:48.234
What the hell are you doing?

17:48.234 --> 17:50.202
You said to use
what's important to him.

17:50.202 --> 17:52.338
You seem pretty important.

17:52.338 --> 17:55.908
If you don't want your
girlfriend's brains on you,

17:55.908 --> 17:57.543
you'll give me
that code.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.716
Hey, so while you were gone,

18:03.716 --> 18:07.954
we I.D.'d everyone who bought
into Rich's eco scam.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.489
And this is
Daniel Katzovich.

18:10.489 --> 18:11.824
Katzovich was
a client of yours?

18:11.824 --> 18:13.159
He was not a bad dude
at the time.

18:13.159 --> 18:14.193
Who is this guy?

18:14.193 --> 18:15.928
He's the head of ELM,

18:15.928 --> 18:17.129
the Eco Liberation Movement.

18:17.129 --> 18:19.298
They bombed
Providence Paper Mill,

18:19.298 --> 18:20.599
killing 40 union workers,

18:20.599 --> 18:23.569
torched Polivy Heating Oil,
another 12 dead.

18:23.569 --> 18:25.137
All their attacks
have one aim--

18:25.137 --> 18:26.639
destroy those
who destroy the Earth.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.341
How is Daniel still
at large

18:28.341 --> 18:30.109
if he's responsible
for attacks like these?

18:30.109 --> 18:31.544
Nothing ties to him directly.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.846
You didn't just inspire
one guy, Rich.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.215
You inspired
an entire terrorist group.

18:36.215 --> 18:37.650
No, my algorithm did.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.086
My algorithm inspired
a terrorist group.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.454
That doesn't sound any better,
I'm sorry.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.489
Daniel must have taken
Rich's manifesto

18:43.489 --> 18:46.192
and used it as the foundational
doctrine for ELM.

18:46.192 --> 18:47.994
He always seemed a little
too into it, you know?

18:47.994 --> 18:49.962
He was one of the only clients
I actually met with in person.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.365
He bought so many credits,
I took him out to this
vegan restaurant.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.300
Not important.
Fair enough.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.534
What is it?

18:55.534 --> 18:57.636
After Luther killed
Dr. Miller...

18:57.636 --> 18:58.938
Oh, excuse me.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.007
...I wrote a program to sort
through her e-mails,

19:01.007 --> 19:03.409
hoping to ascertain motive.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.746
Dr. Miller was
a member of ELM.

19:08.247 --> 19:09.915
Why would Luther kill
one of his own?

19:09.915 --> 19:11.417
Looks like she wanted out.

19:11.417 --> 19:12.785
Why?
Another attack or... ?

19:12.785 --> 19:15.788
She was stockpiling
white phosphorous.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.758
White phosphorus starts fires
which can't be put out.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.493
It's so deadly
it's banned in war.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.695
She was hoarding the stuff
for months,

19:22.695 --> 19:25.097
but two weeks ago
ELM seized her stash.

19:25.097 --> 19:26.966
So Luther was
the clean-up guy.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.467
Made sure
she didn't talk.

19:28.467 --> 19:30.302
"New York is a scourge..."

19:30.302 --> 19:32.338
"Today the parasites burn..."

19:33.639 --> 19:35.841
ELM is going to deploy
that white phosphorous

19:35.841 --> 19:37.543
somewhere in New York.

19:37.543 --> 19:38.878
Today.

19:42.314 --> 19:45.785
I'm gonna count down
from five.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.520
Five...

19:47.520 --> 19:49.655
four...
Reade, please.

19:49.655 --> 19:51.223
Oh, what, I'm supposed
to save you now?

19:51.223 --> 19:52.324
I don't even know you.

19:52.324 --> 19:53.926
Three...
She's serious.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.728
Two...
All right, stop!

19:55.728 --> 19:58.264
Okay, don't kill her.
I'll give you what you want.

19:58.264 --> 20:00.099
I stand corrected.

20:00.099 --> 20:01.767
You were useful
after all.

20:05.671 --> 20:08.908
Katzovich has a multi-acre
compound in Long Island.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.176
So we storm the place.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.977
We'll bring him in
for questioning.

20:11.977 --> 20:14.213
No, I mean,
if the white phosphorus
isn't at the compound,

20:14.213 --> 20:16.248
then a raid could trigger
an attack.

20:16.248 --> 20:18.417
So you got a better idea?

20:18.417 --> 20:21.320
Well, I'm apparently still
beloved to these folks.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.922
What if I was
your ticket inside?

20:22.922 --> 20:24.690
What?
That's not the worst idea.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.725
Okay then, we're going
undercover.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.561
I'll stay in the truck
with Keaton.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.431
Bring me to my people.

20:42.341 --> 20:44.310
I told you not to disturb me.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.011
Jackson Fernwood
is here.

20:52.818 --> 20:53.853
Hmm.

20:55.187 --> 20:58.324
Jackson,
I can't believe it.

20:58.324 --> 21:00.159
It's been...
Years.

21:00.159 --> 21:01.961
My goodness,
you look good.

21:01.961 --> 21:02.995
Come to me, Dan-Dan.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.398
And you are?
Um...

21:06.398 --> 21:07.466
This is Wendell.

21:07.466 --> 21:09.702
Wendell, his assistant.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.203
Well, more of a servant,
really.

21:11.203 --> 21:14.206
But who among us is not
a servant to Mother Gaia?

21:14.206 --> 21:15.908
Don't push it, Rich.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.710
So you've continued
your environmental work?

21:17.710 --> 21:20.946
We haven't heard from you
in quite some...

21:20.946 --> 21:22.114
Continued?

21:22.114 --> 21:23.816
No, my dear.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.017
I've increased it.

21:25.017 --> 21:28.120
When you disappeared,
we reached out, but...

21:28.120 --> 21:29.555
we never heard back.

21:29.555 --> 21:30.689
Say you got rid of your phone.

21:30.689 --> 21:32.791
I had to abandon
my "Smartphone."

21:32.791 --> 21:34.493
I don't need Instagram
telling me

21:34.493 --> 21:36.228
where to find
my free-trade coffee.

21:36.228 --> 21:37.363
And your e

21:37.363 --> 21:38.798
Yes, and snail mail.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.233
Don't get me started
on the USPS

21:41.233 --> 21:42.968
and the rampant
waste of paper.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.336
Easy.

21:44.336 --> 21:46.172
We assumed you'd lost
devotion to the cause.

21:46.172 --> 21:47.239
No, no.

21:47.239 --> 21:48.941
Opposite, opposite.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.143
Time to prove your bona fides.
Tell them you're--

21:51.143 --> 21:52.244
I've been on the offense,

21:52.244 --> 21:54.079
making some big moves.

21:54.079 --> 21:56.115
Like?
Fires.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.050
You're gonna have
to be more specific.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.418
Starting fires.

21:59.418 --> 22:02.288
All right, site the Northern
California fires

22:02.288 --> 22:03.789
that burned down
the tract homes.

22:03.789 --> 22:05.024
They never figured out
how it got started.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.492
For example,
the ones in NorCal.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.727
We were responsible
for that one.

22:08.727 --> 22:11.463
Why come back now if you're
doing so well without us?

22:11.463 --> 22:13.566
Well, humbly
I've returned to help.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.534
Kurt, pad his ego.
He's a narcissist.

22:15.534 --> 22:17.736
And to learn.

22:17.736 --> 22:21.640
Jackson hasn't stopped talking
about you, Daniel, and...

22:21.640 --> 22:23.742
what we've done
is-- is nothing

22:23.742 --> 22:26.378
compared to what
you've achieved with ELM.

22:26.378 --> 22:28.214
I wouldn't say
"nothing," Wendell.

22:28.214 --> 22:29.715
I would.

22:29.715 --> 22:32.618
This compound is legendary,

22:32.618 --> 22:34.753
all thanks to you.

22:38.891 --> 22:39.925
Well...

22:39.925 --> 22:42.361
Let me show you
around.

22:47.433 --> 22:50.302
We have 18 acres
of organic gardens,

22:50.302 --> 22:51.670
water purification
system.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.772
And an absolutely
breathtaking view.

22:53.772 --> 22:56.775
Although I'm not really
a beach person myself,

22:56.775 --> 22:58.544
I find once the sand
gets in your swim--

22:58.544 --> 23:00.112
The ocean's location
is strictly strategic.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.981
Between operating
our own wind farm

23:01.981 --> 23:03.782
and the state-of-the-art
solar panels,

23:03.782 --> 23:05.684
we make 100% of our energy.

23:05.684 --> 23:07.953
My truck even runs
on vegetable oil.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.955
So it's a completely
independent commune.

23:09.955 --> 23:11.991
In every sense
of the word, yes.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.061
That doesn't look
very communal.

23:17.296 --> 23:18.897
Okay, I'll buy you
some time.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.666
Daniel, I'd love to meet
your members of your movement,

23:20.666 --> 23:22.635
if that's possible.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.436
Jackson Fernwood,
you're heard of me, of course.

23:24.436 --> 23:26.438
Hello, hello.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.608
How you feeling?

23:30.509 --> 23:31.944
Hanging in.

23:33.545 --> 23:35.547
Been wanting to ask you
something.

23:35.547 --> 23:37.016
Yeah.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.586
I know it's crazy, but...

23:41.620 --> 23:43.622
I want to see Shepherd.

23:43.622 --> 23:44.890
One last time.

23:46.792 --> 23:47.760
Why?

23:47.760 --> 23:50.062
After what
she's done to you?

23:50.062 --> 23:51.563
I want to interrogate her.

23:51.563 --> 23:53.732
See if she knows anything
about a cure.

23:53.732 --> 23:55.434
You think
we haven't done that?

23:55.434 --> 23:58.570
Come on, you think
I want you dead?

23:58.570 --> 24:01.073
You and I have
come a long way, Jane.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.042
I haven't done it.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.877
She might admit something
to me that...

24:04.877 --> 24:06.578
She doesn't know anything.

24:09.515 --> 24:11.884
I have other reasons
for wanting to see Shepherd.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.088
I'm dying.

24:16.088 --> 24:17.890
Do you understand that?

24:17.890 --> 24:19.725
I don't know
how much time I have.

24:19.725 --> 24:22.061
And you want to spend it
with a monster?

24:23.429 --> 24:25.230
I need to see her.

24:27.066 --> 24:29.601
Look, I'm sorry, Jane,
but the CIA doesn't use

24:29.601 --> 24:31.837
black sites to host
family reunions, okay?

24:31.837 --> 24:34.840
So the answer's no.
No?

24:34.840 --> 24:36.408
I know all about
what you do there.

24:36.408 --> 24:39.578
I know what it feels like
to not see the sun for months,

24:39.578 --> 24:42.014
to feel like you're
losing your mind.

24:43.515 --> 24:45.884
Now, my memory might be shot,

24:45.884 --> 24:48.787
but I remember everything
you did to me.

24:48.787 --> 24:50.622
And you don't think
you owe me one?

24:53.692 --> 24:55.761
And this is the favor
you want to call in?

25:03.435 --> 25:05.270
I'll take you up tomorrow.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.640
Shepherd could be in any one
of the five sites

25:08.640 --> 25:10.142
on the Eastern seaboard.

25:10.142 --> 25:12.444
How far is the drive?

25:12.444 --> 25:16.749
I, um, I have more doctor's
appointments in the city.

25:16.749 --> 25:19.118
We'll be back
by the afternoon.

25:20.919 --> 25:23.655
There's a locked garage.
I'm heading to it now.

25:23.655 --> 25:25.023
Be ready to move in.

25:26.325 --> 25:28.360
I'm in...

25:28.360 --> 25:29.928
but I don't have
a lot of time.

25:29.928 --> 25:31.930
Do you have eyes
on the white phosphorous?

25:31.930 --> 25:34.733
No, got my eyes on
a lot of empty boxes.

25:36.301 --> 25:37.636
Hang on.

25:39.605 --> 25:41.940
And some sort of EMP device.

25:41.940 --> 25:44.209
I'll send you a photo now.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.544
Got 'em.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.312
Could be for disabling
communication

25:47.312 --> 25:48.580
at the bombing target

25:48.580 --> 25:49.782
to prevent calls
to first responders.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.383
I got three barrels here.

25:51.383 --> 25:55.220
They do have some sort of
white residue on them.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.722
That would be
the white phosphorus.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.724
Be careful.
It's highly reactive.

25:59.825 --> 26:01.260
Their stockpile was here.

26:05.497 --> 26:07.299
These boxes have
labels on them.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.902
For drones.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.838
Empty drone boxes and empty
barrels of white phosphorus.

26:12.838 --> 26:14.673
They're planning
an air strike.

26:14.673 --> 26:16.341
So this was the assembly point.

26:16.341 --> 26:18.377
And we can't just evacuate
one building.

26:18.377 --> 26:21.046
No, the whole city
will be under attack.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.852
I'm sorry,
I heard "air raid"?

26:26.852 --> 26:29.955
The white phosphorous
isn't there anymore.

26:29.955 --> 26:32.090
It looks like
it's being prepped
for aerial distribution.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.159
Okay, we need to get the hell
outta here right now.

26:34.159 --> 26:35.894
Actually, you need to find
the launch site.

26:35.894 --> 26:38.130
Rich, have you seen
any maps or plans--

26:38.130 --> 26:39.565
You don't think I would have
mentioned that already?!

26:39.565 --> 26:41.467
Can you get
on Daniel's phone?

26:41.467 --> 26:43.702
Oh, yeah, I'll just tell 'em
I need to call my friends
at the FBI!

26:43.702 --> 26:45.103
Rich, calm.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.738
Okay, okay, you know what,
I can do that.

26:46.738 --> 26:47.973
He's been on his phone
a lot today.

26:47.973 --> 26:49.374
He's probably been
communicating

26:49.374 --> 26:52.044
with whoever's
overseeing the launch.
Yeah.

26:52.044 --> 26:54.012
Weller, I'm sending you
an upload link now.

26:54.012 --> 26:56.315
Once Rich has the phone,
swap the SIMs

26:56.315 --> 26:58.050
and import the data.
Got it.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.018
"Once Rich has the phone,"
like that's the easy part!

27:00.018 --> 27:02.354
Download's almost finished.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.329
You're in way over
your head, aren't you?

27:11.663 --> 27:13.165
Let's look at the people
you run with.

27:13.165 --> 27:15.267
You worked with Blake because
she was easy to control,

27:15.267 --> 27:17.135
but Madeline's
a different story, isn't she?

27:17.135 --> 27:19.137
Not your job
to worry about me anymore.

27:19.137 --> 27:21.306
I'm not worried about you
because it's my job.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.342
It's written
all over your face.

27:23.342 --> 27:27.613
Madeline is vicious and erratic,
and you're afraid.

27:27.613 --> 27:28.981
I told you...

27:30.849 --> 27:32.851
I don't work
for Madeline.

27:32.851 --> 27:34.453
You might have gotten
what you wanted this time,

27:34.453 --> 27:37.022
but what happens the next,
when you can't deliver?

27:37.022 --> 27:38.390
You think she's
gonna have your back?

27:40.025 --> 27:42.261
It's not too late,
you can come in,

27:42.261 --> 27:43.795
I'll cut you a deal.

27:43.795 --> 27:45.097
But you gotta do it now.

27:45.097 --> 27:46.498
You go any further
across this line,

27:46.498 --> 27:48.133
then I can't help you, Tasha.

27:51.803 --> 27:53.839
Thank you for your cooperation,

27:53.839 --> 27:56.141
and your insight
into my coworker.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.712
I wonder what our boss
would think

28:00.712 --> 28:02.548
about your generous offer.

28:02.548 --> 28:06.652
How can I know that you won't
rat us out to save yourself?

28:06.652 --> 28:09.922
Because he's lying.

28:11.423 --> 28:14.660
Even if you wanted help,
if I step one foot
in the FBI,

28:14.660 --> 28:16.995
there's a good chance
I'll never see sunlight again.

28:19.164 --> 28:22.134
Isn't that right,
Assistant Director?

28:25.737 --> 28:27.072
Smart girl.

28:32.578 --> 28:34.279
Good-bye, Reade.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.096
Daniel, I must ask,

28:51.096 --> 28:52.798
I've been staring
at it all day.

28:52.798 --> 28:54.299
Where did you
get this shirt?

28:54.299 --> 28:55.300
Get it?

28:55.300 --> 28:57.369
We don't buy
what we don't have to.

28:57.369 --> 28:58.637
Ah, yes.

28:58.637 --> 29:01.039
The wasteful practices
of the textiles industry.

29:01.039 --> 29:02.474
It's really
the shipping companies

29:02.474 --> 29:05.477
who do the most damage.
We made this.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.112
Of course you did.

29:07.112 --> 29:09.114
We have an onsite loom.

29:09.114 --> 29:11.316
Onsite, really?
May I touch?

29:11.316 --> 29:13.852
It's just got such an inviting
sort of feel to it.

29:13.852 --> 29:15.220
It's silk or a kind of cotton?

29:15.220 --> 29:17.956
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

29:17.956 --> 29:20.559
You had a reputation
for seducing followers.

29:20.559 --> 29:24.329
But I'm not a follower anymore,
and I'm not interested.

29:24.329 --> 29:25.831
Understood.

29:25.831 --> 29:28.166
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

29:28.166 --> 29:29.434
Daniel, where's your bathroom?

29:29.434 --> 29:31.470
Down the hall,
door on the left.

29:31.470 --> 29:32.904
Okay, thank you.

29:34.139 --> 29:36.508
If it's yellow,
let it mellow.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.112
I've got his SIM card.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.080
I'm transferring it
to my phone now.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.915
Put it on "do not disturb"
and start the upload.

29:43.915 --> 29:45.117
It'll take about six minutes.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.685
So, about this loom...

29:48.687 --> 29:49.921
Excuse me.

29:51.423 --> 29:53.992
Landline... it's pretty
old-school.

29:53.992 --> 29:55.994
What, is he gonna listen
to a Walkman next?

29:55.994 --> 29:57.996
Remember those?

29:57.996 --> 30:00.265
What do you mean,
you just called?

30:00.265 --> 30:01.933
When?

30:01.933 --> 30:03.402
Daniel's a little
on edge.

30:03.402 --> 30:06.238
Understood.
I'm gonna go check on Wendell.

30:09.941 --> 30:11.977
My phone's missing.
Where's Jackson?

30:11.977 --> 30:13.178
He just stepped out.

30:13.178 --> 30:14.880
And his friend?
I don't know.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.682
That was the bombing team.

30:16.682 --> 30:18.383
They've been
trying to call.

30:18.383 --> 30:21.019
Find them now!

30:21.019 --> 30:22.554
And activate the EMP.

30:22.554 --> 30:25.223
If they're cops, we can't
let them get word out.

30:25.223 --> 30:27.626
Okay, bail out, bail out,
we're burned!

30:27.626 --> 30:28.960
Rich?

30:30.095 --> 30:32.030
Rich?

30:32.030 --> 30:33.965
Rich!
You copy?

30:33.965 --> 30:35.267
Hey!

30:42.774 --> 30:44.076
Stop!

30:49.047 --> 30:50.649
Are you okay?

30:50.649 --> 30:52.584
Yeah.
Thank you.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.753
Comms are fried,
they must have used the EMP.

30:54.753 --> 30:56.088
Where's Rich?

30:58.356 --> 31:00.192
I told you I didn't trust
the timing

31:00.192 --> 31:01.793
of him showing up again.

31:01.793 --> 31:03.195
The feds must have
gotten to him.

31:03.195 --> 31:05.597
If I ever see Jackson again,
he's a dead man.

31:11.837 --> 31:13.238
Guys...

31:13.238 --> 31:16.274
I'm with Daniel in the truck,
can you tail us?

31:16.274 --> 31:17.342
Guys?

31:18.710 --> 31:20.011
Guys?

31:24.783 --> 31:26.818
We had the building secured,
but Daniel made his own exit.

31:26.818 --> 31:28.153
How the hell
did that happen?

31:28.153 --> 31:29.988
Through an unmarked easement
in the back woods.

31:29.988 --> 31:31.590
Rich is gone, too.

31:32.924 --> 31:34.159
What?

31:34.159 --> 31:35.527
I got something
off Daniel's phone.

31:35.527 --> 31:38.130
Yeah, hang on,
I'm putting you on speaker.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.632
The EMP blast prematurely
terminated the upload,

31:40.632 --> 31:43.335
but I was able to retrieve
his last incoming texts.

31:43.335 --> 31:45.504
What do they say?
A bunch of scary stuff,

31:45.504 --> 31:47.773
but more importantly,
they originated in Brooklyn,

31:47.773 --> 31:49.274
Greenpoint, to be exact.

31:49.274 --> 31:51.676
Okay, Patterson, Greenpoint
is three square miles.

31:51.676 --> 31:53.945
I'm working on getting you
a more precise location.

31:53.945 --> 31:55.313
We're heading there now.

31:55.313 --> 31:57.382
Send us the exact coordinates
when you get them.

31:57.382 --> 31:58.416
Let's move.

32:09.461 --> 32:11.396
Get them in the air now,
let's go.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.143
Whoa.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.947
I'm a nimble gazelle.
I'm a nimble gazelle.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.248
Okay.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.590
Roadside Service Center.

32:38.590 --> 32:39.891
What's your emergency?

32:39.891 --> 32:41.793
Yes, hi, I'm trying to thwart
a domestic terror plot.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.795
Could you please connect me
with the New York branch
of the FBI?

32:43.795 --> 32:45.497
Just tell 'em it's Rich,
they'll know who that is.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.399
Sir, prank calling
an emergency operator

32:47.399 --> 32:48.733
is a serious offense.

32:48.733 --> 32:50.535
No, no, no, I'm--
seriously, I'm with the FBI.

32:50.535 --> 32:52.370
Seriously, this is illegal.
I'm hanging up.

32:52.370 --> 32:54.673
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, please.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.007
What if you're wrong, huh?

32:56.007 --> 32:57.509
Think about that
just for a second.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.077
I mean, you know, the call
is being recorded, I assume,

32:59.077 --> 33:00.145
and I don't wanna put this
on you, but...

33:00.145 --> 33:02.147
Hello?

33:02.147 --> 33:04.282
Okay.

33:05.383 --> 33:07.552
How much longer?
Two minutes, tops.

33:10.021 --> 33:11.590
Stop what you're doing
right now!

33:13.291 --> 33:15.227
What the hell
are you doing?

33:15.227 --> 33:16.928
I'm saving the planet.

33:16.928 --> 33:18.563
No, we're saving
the planet.

33:18.563 --> 33:20.799
Daniel, I have
the conch now.

33:20.799 --> 33:22.033
It's my time to talk.

33:23.568 --> 33:26.771
I built something
beautiful, peaceful.

33:26.771 --> 33:28.106
A true collective,

33:28.106 --> 33:31.376
united by our shared love
of Mother Earth.

33:31.376 --> 33:32.978
You really think setting
Manhattan on fire

33:32.978 --> 33:34.279
is gonna be good
for the environment?

33:34.279 --> 33:35.647
I mean, it's mostly
garbage, right?

33:35.647 --> 33:37.716
Exactly.
No, I mean
literal garbage.

33:37.716 --> 33:40.752
Like litter, rubbish,
trash, et cetera.

33:40.752 --> 33:42.988
And setting it on fire's
not gonna be good

33:42.988 --> 33:44.289
for the ozone layer,
am I right?

33:44.289 --> 33:46.224
Do you know
how many over-consumers

33:46.224 --> 33:47.659
populate Manhattan?

33:47.659 --> 33:49.628
I wanna say eight million,
give or take?

33:49.628 --> 33:53.398
Fires are a natural part
of a forest's life cycle.

33:53.398 --> 33:57.602
From the ashes of Manhattan,
a new, natural city will grow.

33:57.602 --> 33:59.371
I don't see
how that's possible.

34:03.174 --> 34:04.776
Take him out!

34:11.249 --> 34:12.651
Everyone out!
Everyone out!

34:18.790 --> 34:21.226
Cover me!
Go, go, go, go!
Go!

34:32.270 --> 34:34.439
Jane!
Come to us, now!

34:37.075 --> 34:38.410
Jane!

34:38.410 --> 34:39.611
My back spasmed!

34:40.545 --> 34:41.746
I got her.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.822
Oh... you are kidding me.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.992
Move it!

35:00.966 --> 35:02.267
Kurt...

35:12.243 --> 35:13.445
Jane...

35:14.813 --> 35:15.880
Stay with him.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.383
Come on, Keaton.
Hang on.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.610
I got the controls.

35:45.610 --> 35:48.813
You're dealing
with WY802 drones,

35:48.813 --> 35:50.415
you're gonna need
to toggle...

35:50.415 --> 35:52.417
It's a remote control,
Patterson, I got it.

35:52.417 --> 35:54.753
Right, yes.
Super user-friendly.

36:05.096 --> 36:07.032
Ah, no!

36:07.032 --> 36:08.333
Freeze.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.368
You got the right
to remain silent.

36:10.368 --> 36:11.703
And the right to apologize

36:11.703 --> 36:13.304
for turning a perfectly
good online scam

36:13.304 --> 36:15.040
into a terrorist
organization.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.541
You like the Earth so much,

36:16.541 --> 36:17.976
why don't you get down
on the ground and kiss it?

36:17.976 --> 36:19.477
Smoochie-smoochie.

36:19.477 --> 36:21.312
Come on, you've seen "Cops,"
you know how this goes.

36:31.089 --> 36:32.757
Come on, Keaton.
Stay with me.

36:32.757 --> 36:36.428
Hey... you're gonna call
my wife and kid, okay?

36:36.428 --> 36:38.930
No, you're gonna
call them yourself.

36:40.698 --> 36:41.966
Keaton?

36:43.835 --> 36:45.937
No... no...

36:51.676 --> 36:53.044
I've been calling you guys.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.747
Zapata's in Manhattan,
we need to find her.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.148
What do you mean?

36:57.148 --> 36:58.716
What happened
to your eye?

36:58.716 --> 37:00.585
I just spend the entire day
with her tied to a chair.

37:00.585 --> 37:02.253
Like an S&M thing,
or... ?

37:02.253 --> 37:03.822
She broke into my home!

37:03.822 --> 37:05.857
I'm getting sick and tired
of Keaton telling us

37:05.857 --> 37:07.158
he's gonna handle it.

37:07.158 --> 37:08.693
He damn well better share
some intel with us,

37:08.693 --> 37:09.961
and we're gonna
find her, now.

37:12.197 --> 37:13.398
What?!
What is it?

37:13.398 --> 37:15.834
Keaton was shot today
in the field.

37:15.834 --> 37:18.436
He's in
a medically-induced coma.

37:18.436 --> 37:20.538
They're not sure
he's gonna make it out.

37:25.043 --> 37:26.711
All right.

37:26.711 --> 37:28.213
Patterson, send out
a nationwide FBI alert

37:28.213 --> 37:29.748
with a focus on the tri-state,
and send forensics

37:29.748 --> 37:31.449
over to my place.
She wasn't alone.

37:31.449 --> 37:32.717
I'm gonna need the two of you

37:32.717 --> 37:34.219
to do a digital analysis
on the servers.

37:34.219 --> 37:35.820
I think she just
accessed them.

37:35.820 --> 37:38.256
But those are unhackable.
I know, I...

37:38.256 --> 37:41.326
I let her on.
I didn't have a choice.

37:42.660 --> 37:43.728
Okay.

37:43.728 --> 37:45.497
We'll figure out
what she took

37:45.497 --> 37:47.432
or gave us.

38:04.382 --> 38:06.484
Jane...

38:06.484 --> 38:09.621
I'm so sorry, but you're not
a match for this treatment.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.923
Are you sure
there's no... ?

38:11.923 --> 38:14.926
Unfortunately, the results
were conclusive.

38:14.926 --> 38:17.762
Your body would reject
this form of stem-cell therapy.

38:17.762 --> 38:19.497
I'm truly sorry, I wish
there was something

38:19.497 --> 38:20.999
we could do to help you.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.068
I'm so sorry.

38:25.436 --> 38:27.238
We're going to find a cure.

38:27.238 --> 38:28.573
Roman did it.

38:34.112 --> 38:35.413
Okay.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.516
So, uh...

38:38.516 --> 38:40.118
That's it.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.519
I'm-- I'm gonna die.

38:41.519 --> 38:44.055
Don't say that.
Why?

38:44.055 --> 38:46.257
Right now there isn't
a cure for me.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.959
Jane...
And I thought that this

38:47.959 --> 38:49.527
might actually work,

38:49.527 --> 38:52.530
that I'd have a real shot
at beating this.

38:52.530 --> 38:55.567
You do.
We're not finished yet.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.704
There were so many things
I wanted to do,

38:59.704 --> 39:01.172
things that I needed--

39:01.172 --> 39:02.473
You will.

39:03.374 --> 39:04.876
We will.

39:04.876 --> 39:08.112
We're going
to figure this out.

39:09.547 --> 39:10.982
And what if we don't?

39:12.350 --> 39:13.985
What if we can't?

39:15.853 --> 39:16.988
Come here.

39:19.424 --> 39:20.692
It's okay.

39:21.559 --> 39:22.927
It's okay.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.530
It's gonna be okay.

39:35.773 --> 39:38.843
Stop looking into Violet.

39:38.843 --> 39:40.445
Okay, but I--

39:40.445 --> 39:42.347
I shouldn't have
second-guessed Allie.

39:42.347 --> 39:43.748
She's got a lot
on her plate,

39:43.748 --> 39:47.252
and she doesn't need me
being paranoid.

39:47.252 --> 39:48.953
Look, I don't know
what's going on

39:48.953 --> 39:49.921
between you two.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.356
But I already looked
into Violet.

39:51.356 --> 39:54.192
And she is...

39:54.192 --> 39:55.627
no Girl Scout.

39:57.195 --> 39:59.264
Violet's aliases
have aliases.

39:59.264 --> 40:00.765
She's the queen
of the black market.

40:00.765 --> 40:02.267
She can get you
anything from...

40:02.267 --> 40:05.803
surface-to-air missiles
to drugs to human organs.

40:05.803 --> 40:08.039
Anything for the right price.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.842
Are you okay?

40:10.842 --> 40:13.111
I mean, I know
Allie missed it,

40:13.111 --> 40:15.880
but she should be happy
you found this for her, right?

40:17.448 --> 40:18.683
Yeah.

40:26.457 --> 40:27.759
Hey.

40:30.061 --> 40:32.263
Uh... arnica gel.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.665
It'll help with the bruising.

40:37.368 --> 40:38.603
You should go home.

40:38.603 --> 40:40.471
I'm not leaving here
until I find her.

40:40.471 --> 40:41.773
I'm not sure that's real.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.074
She couldn't have just
disappeared again!

40:46.244 --> 40:47.478
Ugh...

40:48.746 --> 40:50.415
I have teams
combing the city,

40:50.415 --> 40:52.917
every port,
every airfield.

40:52.917 --> 40:56.054
I just need to stop her
before she hurts anyone else.

41:03.261 --> 41:06.397
My contact at the CIA
says it's a day trip.

41:06.397 --> 41:08.800
Shepherd has to be
at the Rowayton black site.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.835
I'll start prepping
the breakout.

41:23.681 --> 41:25.984
What took you so long?

41:25.984 --> 41:28.286
There was a delay
getting onto Reade's computer,

41:28.286 --> 41:29.787
but we got what we needed.

41:29.787 --> 41:31.589
Better late than never,
I suppose.

41:31.589 --> 41:32.790
There's something else
you should see.

41:32.790 --> 41:34.359
It's in the trunk.

41:48.473 --> 41:49.807
What was that all about?

41:49.807 --> 41:51.776
She was MI-6,
an undercover agent

41:51.776 --> 41:54.379
in your inner circle.

41:54.379 --> 41:56.080
I did some digging.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.582
It's all there.

41:57.582 --> 42:00.118
Official dossier
from the UK.

42:00.118 --> 42:03.388
I was advised
there might be a mole.

42:03.388 --> 42:04.822
I was worried
it might be you.

42:06.324 --> 42:09.360
When this is over,
your loyalty won't
be forgotten.
