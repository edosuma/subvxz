that's not good enough,

you were still inside of it.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.600
What?

24:11.200 --> 24:12.486
He was just here.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.051
Mmm, no, I assure you, he was not.

24:14.280 --> 24:15.805
You were alone when I arrived.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.484
You were talking to yourself.

24:19.360 --> 24:22.011
Perhaps that stone
isn't finished with you, after all.

24:23.520 --> 24:24.726
In the meantime,

24:25.040 --> 24:29.329
if either you or your brother
harm one of my men again,

24:30.200 --> 24:33.409
I will gut the one of you
and feed the other the entrails.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.364
Thanks for stepping away from baby-land.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.410
Anything to avoid a guessing game
about how big Caroline's belly is.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.886
Oh.

25:03.080 --> 25:04.320
What do you want?

25:05.080 --> 25:07.003
- I need to see Elena.
- That's not an option.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.168
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I just need to see her face for a minute.

25:09.720 --> 25:11.722
A little reminder that everything's
gonna be okay, you know?

25:11.880 --> 25:12.927
When you gave me her coffin,

25:13.080 --> 25:14.445
you made me swear
to not let anybody see her.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.444
- Yeah--
- Especially you.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.603
(SCOFFS)
I was feeling a little sentimental.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.729
- You told me that's what you would say.
- Ah.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.843
You figured at some point
you'd get impatient,

25:23.080 --> 25:24.286
or lose your nerve,
or have a really bad day.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.568
You said under no circumstance
am I allowed to give in to you.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.444
I changed my mind, Lockwood.

25:29.280 --> 25:30.566
I know what happened the other night.

25:31.240 --> 25:32.446
I know you're sick.

25:32.800 --> 25:33.881
Where is Stefan, anyway?

25:34.040 --> 25:35.041
- Listen to me.
-(GRUNTS)

25:35.200 --> 25:36.247
We can walk upstairs right now

25:36.440 --> 25:37.965
and turn that baby shower
into a blood bath.

25:38.640 --> 25:42.122
Or you can take me to see my girl.

25:44.640 --> 25:45.926
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

25:46.480 --> 25:48.130
No muss, no fuss.

Mr. Donovan.

26:49.960 --> 26:52.486
The good news is,
you actually have a valid license,

26:52.680 --> 26:56.127
which means at some point
you did learn how to drive.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.726
The bad news is, that can only mean

26:57.880 --> 26:59.882
you're swerving between lanes
because you're drunk.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.441
I'm not drunk. I had a couple of drinks
at a party. I already--

27:02.640 --> 27:04.449
Step out of the car, please. Now.

- Hey.
- Hey. Why didn't you answer your phone?

28:30.360 --> 28:32.647
I'm sorry,
I was using it for the playlist.

28:32.880 --> 28:33.927
Are you all right?

28:34.080 --> 28:35.127
- Has Damon been here?
- No.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.566
- Why would he be?
- I don't know where he is.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.489
I thought he was with me,
and then he wasn't, and--

28:38.640 --> 28:40.642
- Okay, okay, Stefan, just calm down.

28:45.600 --> 28:46.806
It's happening again.

28:48.800 --> 28:49.801
I was talking to Damon,

28:50.080 --> 28:52.731
I think he was there,
but now I don't know when he left.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.801
It's okay.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.081
You're okay.

-(GRUNTS)
- You're still denying your nature.

29:15.240 --> 29:17.527
You haven't let go
of what's holding you back.

29:17.760 --> 29:20.366
What does that hell-stone
have to do with my true nature?

29:20.520 --> 29:21.965
A Phoenix Stone.

29:22.520 --> 29:23.931
It doesn't trap you.

29:24.120 --> 29:25.360
It frees you,

29:25.600 --> 29:28.490
to be reborn as your true self.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.330
You wanna see my true self?

29:31.640 --> 29:33.369
- I need to go find Damon, all right?
- No, you don't.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.206
You know what?
We are going to take care of you first.

29:36.360 --> 29:39.364
How are you gonna take care of me?
My soul was literally trapped in a rock--

29:39.600 --> 29:41.523
Yeah, until you passed some kind of test.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.643
You never told me
how you earned your freedom.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.046
Bonnie pulled me out with a spell,
you know that.

29:45.280 --> 29:47.169
No, something else happened
in that hell-world,

29:47.360 --> 29:49.010
something that you won't admit.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.009
And you can't keep hiding
like this, Stefan.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.207
You can't.

29:52.440 --> 29:53.965
Just please, let me help you.

29:54.120 --> 29:57.283
There's nothing we can do
about it now. Okay?

29:59.720 --> 30:01.563
God damn it. You have to tell me.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.801
That's the only way
that we're gonna get through it.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.485
You have to try. Just--

30:08.040 --> 30:09.644
God, you can't go on like this.

30:14.520 --> 30:17.205
I was living
in a repeating loop of misery.

30:20.520 --> 30:23.524
Every loop ended
with Damon dragging me into the quarry.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.929
The water was black and freezing.

30:29.240 --> 30:30.730
We were drowning together.

30:32.600 --> 30:35.171
Every time I tried to swim to the surface,

30:36.200 --> 30:37.884
he dragged me back down.

30:41.840 --> 30:45.083
<i>Every time I tried to save him,
I died, too-</i>

30:46.280 --> 30:49.523
I finally realized
that there was only one way to escape.

30:50.440 --> 30:51.885
If I wanted to survive,

30:52.280 --> 30:53.770
I had to go on without him.

30:57.080 --> 30:58.286
So, I let him go.

31:11.880 --> 31:13.120
I abandoned him.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.803
I let my brother drown,

31:17.800 --> 31:19.802
so I could save myself.

31:21.080 --> 31:24.971
So, that's why you're hallucinating him?

31:26.480 --> 31:30.724
Because some faux-version
of your brother is upset

31:30.920 --> 31:34.163
with something that you did
in a fake reality?

31:34.320 --> 31:37.449
The hell-stone is trying
to tell me something.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.448
It's trying to prove a point.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.280
I will never be happy

31:44.640 --> 31:46.642
until Damon is out of my life for good.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.285
Do you really believe that?

31:58.640 --> 32:00.483
Took my words to heart, did you?

32:01.560 --> 32:03.130
-(GRUNTS)
- Shut up.

32:03.440 --> 32:04.930
I'm not doing this with you anymore.

32:05.480 --> 32:06.891
I told you to leave me alone.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.131
Now, I'm gonna end this.

32:21.120 --> 32:22.167
You're right.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.681
You're not doing it with me anymore.

32:28.440 --> 32:29.680
Henry?

32:31.120 --> 32:32.167
I promised you liberation.

32:32.360 --> 32:33.964
No. Elena!

32:34.160 --> 32:35.491
This was necessary, Damon.

32:35.720 --> 32:39.008
She held you back from being
the monster you really are.

32:39.440 --> 32:40.566
No.

32:40.760 --> 32:42.205
Elena. (GRUNTING)

32:42.760 --> 32:44.046
Oh, my God!

32:45.280 --> 32:46.486
No.

32:46.680 --> 32:48.170
No. No.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.640
No!

32:50.360 --> 32:51.600
Elena!

32:54.480 --> 32:55.720
Oh, God, Elena.

33:06.520 --> 33:09.205
In case it wasn't obvious,
today was supposed to be a fresh start.

33:09.360 --> 33:10.407
Oh, spare me the lecture.

33:10.600 --> 33:13.001
What the hell is your problem?
I was trying to be nice to you.

33:13.440 --> 33:17.764
After I left your wretched party,
I found this in my mail.

33:17.960 --> 33:19.325
Is this your idea of a joke?

33:19.640 --> 33:20.721
Postcard?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.047
You have a pen pal.

33:23.240 --> 33:25.481
If you sent this, you'd best admit it now,

33:25.680 --> 33:27.842
before I squeeze the truth
from your trachea.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.371
Why would I send this to you?

33:29.640 --> 33:31.688
And even if I did,
what's so scary about the alphabet?

33:32.120 --> 33:33.246
It's a warning.

33:34.480 --> 33:35.720
From the Huntress.

33:36.400 --> 33:37.606
You're saying that
like I should know who that is.

33:37.760 --> 33:39.000
You certainly know her weapon.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.126
The sword.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.845
Yes.

33:45.080 --> 33:46.445
Custom-made for her.

33:46.640 --> 33:49.723
She used to it to put Julian in the stone,
along with thousands of other vampires.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.160
She's ruthless.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.971
Once you've been marked by her sword,
she never stops hunting you.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.044
That's how Beau got his scar.

33:59.240 --> 34:01.208
She'll come for him now.
She'll come for all of us.

34:01.600 --> 34:02.761
And how do we stop her?

34:02.960 --> 34:04.405
There's no stopping her, ever.

34:04.760 --> 34:05.807
And there's no "we" involved.

34:05.960 --> 34:08.201
Besides, she's not after you,
so it's really not your concern.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.010
If my friends' lives are in danger,

34:11.040 --> 34:12.643
I'm not gonna stand by and do nothing.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.571
Then what do you propose we do?

34:24.480 --> 34:26.687
OFFICER: Absolutely.
Right this way, sir...

34:29.480 --> 34:31.960
All right, Officer Donovan,
you're clear to go.

34:32.159 --> 34:33.924
But I can't let you drive yourself home.

34:34.520 --> 34:35.931
I think I'll wait it out.

34:36.120 --> 34:37.360
Sure you don't wanna call a friend?

34:38.000 --> 34:40.446
The girl who does
our turndown service just left.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.206
I'm a little light
in the friend department right now.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.484
I heard about your graduation.

34:50.679 --> 34:53.763
The whole "freak mining fire" thing.

34:55.120 --> 34:58.010
I can't imagine
what it'd be like to lose half my class.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.440
Sorry you had to go through that.

35:02.240 --> 35:03.480
Thanks.

35:04.320 --> 35:06.891
It's weird town officials
didn't get FEMA involved,

35:07.360 --> 35:09.840
or at least increase emergency response.

35:10.720 --> 35:14.520
It's almost like everyone's resigned to
letting the fires burn out on their own.

35:15.720 --> 35:17.210
Yeah, that's the way it seems.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.129
Except, if everyone sits
around doing nothing,

35:21.080 --> 35:22.445
there's not gonna be a town left.

35:24.720 --> 35:25.960
Anyway,

35:27.960 --> 35:29.200
good night.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.407
Oh, and, uh, one last thing.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.723
What the hell did we find in your truck?

36:02.280 --> 36:04.009
-(DOOR OPENS)
-(RIC SIGHING)

36:10.680 --> 36:11.920
Um...

36:12.240 --> 36:17.610
I think that I should wash these onesies
with the hypoallergenic detergent first.

36:18.200 --> 36:19.850
Where are the keys to the laundry room?

36:20.040 --> 36:21.405
It's midnight, Caroline.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.728
I mean, we've got plenty of time
to take care of all this stuff.

36:23.920 --> 36:27.083
Yeah, no, I know. We should also really
get a head start on those car seats.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.520
Because I read somewhere that

36:28.720 --> 36:31.087
first-time parents
are just always messing those up.

36:31.280 --> 36:34.602
And did you happen to notice
if the monitor came with little batteries?

36:34.760 --> 36:36.888
You don't have any around here,
and the last thing that you need

36:37.080 --> 36:39.367
are just these screaming, crying babies
in the middle of the night,

36:39.560 --> 36:40.925
and you can't even hear them--

36:41.120 --> 36:44.283
Hey. What's going on with you? You okay?

36:51.760 --> 36:53.967
When were you gonna tell me
that you're leaving?

36:54.920 --> 36:56.445
When I officially got the job.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.608
And what's wrong
with the job that you have now?

36:58.800 --> 37:00.040
There's nothing wrong with the job.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.406
It's the place.

37:02.640 --> 37:03.880
Faculty daycare.

37:04.680 --> 37:08.002
Hello? And a preschool right here
on the campus.

37:08.240 --> 37:12.131
Caroline, I am not raising my kids
anywhere near Mystic Falls,

37:12.320 --> 37:14.084
or Whitmore College, or--

37:14.280 --> 37:15.520
Vampires?

37:17.320 --> 37:18.560
That's right.

37:19.480 --> 37:23.769
Look, I'm sorry, I thought
all this baby stuff bonanza, you know,

37:23.960 --> 37:26.008
was for a single parent on their own...

37:28.240 --> 37:30.049
Yeah, no, it was.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.968
Caroline, I was under the impression,
you know,

37:34.160 --> 37:36.083
that once the babies were born,

37:37.960 --> 37:41.567
that you weren't gonna be involved.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.440
(SIGHS)

37:46.920 --> 37:49.287
Uh, no, I won't. Because they're not mine.

37:49.840 --> 37:51.763
They're yours and Jo's.

37:52.840 --> 37:55.446
Anyway, I actually think
it's really smart.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.205
You know, safety first.

38:00.080 --> 38:04.608
You and your babies should get
as far away from here as you can.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.280
Where were you?

38:14.680 --> 38:15.920
Out.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.565
I had to clear my head.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.486
I let you go.

38:26.560 --> 38:29.006
In my virtual hell,
we were drowning together,

38:30.440 --> 38:33.125
and the only way for me to escape
was to turn my back on you.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.961
And everything
I've been hallucinating since

38:39.480 --> 38:41.209
was to drive that point home.

38:42.960 --> 38:44.200
Of course it was.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.930
The only way for you to be the hero
and have a happy ending

38:48.120 --> 38:50.168
is to leave me in your wake.

38:51.360 --> 38:52.930
How do you figure?

38:53.120 --> 38:55.851
Because my true self is dark, brother.

38:58.960 --> 39:01.691
And all that light
just keeps getting in the way.

39:03.720 --> 39:06.371
Keeping me from being who I really am.

39:07.320 --> 39:08.560
Which is what?

39:08.920 --> 39:10.206
Reckless?

39:10.640 --> 39:11.880
Manipulative?

39:13.200 --> 39:14.440
Selfish?

39:15.200 --> 39:16.486
Sounds about right.

39:18.520 --> 39:20.841
Yeah, it is.

39:24.120 --> 39:25.690
But you're also my brother.

39:29.080 --> 39:34.166
And I'm not gonna give up on you,
not now, not ever.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.889
You're stuck with me, Damon.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.531
I need you to know that.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.684
(SIGHS) Stefan.

39:50.440 --> 39:51.680
L...

39:52.600 --> 39:53.840
What is it?

39:56.160 --> 39:57.400
(SIGHS)

39:59.840 --> 40:02.081
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

40:13.440 --> 40:14.726
We're out of bourbon.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.206
Is that it?

40:25.440 --> 40:26.680
That's it.

40:30.640 --> 40:32.244
Here's to drowning together.

40:42.240 --> 40:45.244
CAROLINE ON TV: We apologize for the
interruption to your current program.

40:45.400 --> 40:46.447
My name is Caroline.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.170
Please listen carefully.

40:48.320 --> 40:51.369
I have an urgent message
for Stefan Salvatore.

40:51.560 --> 40:52.925
We apologize...

41:08.920 --> 41:10.160
(GRUNTS)

41:11.160 --> 41:12.446
What are you doing here?

41:12.640 --> 41:14.608
I thought you were in Mystic Falls.

41:15.520 --> 41:17.409
I had to stop by
and visit some buddies at Dallas PD,

41:17.600 --> 41:19.409
and convince them
this hostage thing was a hoax.

41:19.600 --> 41:20.681
Get up.

41:21.360 --> 41:22.646
You can put the gun down.

41:22.840 --> 41:24.046
Get up.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.249
(SIGHS) Thank you.

41:27.440 --> 41:29.568
- You can go now.
- That's it?

41:29.760 --> 41:30.921
You already did what we needed.

41:31.120 --> 41:32.565
"We"? Are you helping her?

41:32.800 --> 41:35.121
You were the easiest way to get to Stefan.
Don't take it personally.

41:35.320 --> 41:36.685
"Don't take it personally"?

41:36.880 --> 41:38.405
I have a family, Matt.

41:38.600 --> 41:39.647
So did I.

41:39.840 --> 41:42.366
And a girlfriend, and a life,
and now I don't.

41:43.040 --> 41:45.884
So your problems don't mean anything
to me anymore.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.326
Now go.

41:47.520 --> 41:50.444
Get out of sight, and stay out of sight
until the Huntress gets what she wants.
