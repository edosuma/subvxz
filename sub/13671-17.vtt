00:01.000 --> 00:04.280
Previously on St Elsewhere...

00:04.280 --> 00:06.400
You haven't lost an ounce!

00:06.400 --> 00:09.080
I nearly killed myself trying
to kiss 20 pounds goodbye!

00:09.080 --> 00:10.760
She married a chocolatier.

00:10.760 --> 00:13.520
She and Klaus have a cute
little cottage in the Alps.

00:13.520 --> 00:16.840
Here's the deal. The city's
decided to sell St Eligius.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.640
I wanna offer the
mayor a proposal,

00:18.640 --> 00:20.200
 to show we can cut this deficit.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.120
I want you to take this down
to the mail room -

00:22.120 --> 00:26.120
a present for Mrs Craig's mother.

00:28.040 --> 00:32.040
Where's his head?

02:00.440 --> 02:02.640
  Chandler, give me some covers.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.960
   It's cold. I'm bare-skinning.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.720
Mm-hm. The temperature
really dropped last night.

02:07.720 --> 02:11.520
Your feet are icy!

02:11.520 --> 02:15.520
Well, why don't
              we turn on some heat?

02:15.720 --> 02:16.960
I'd love to but it's late.

02:16.960 --> 02:20.240
Mm.

02:20.240 --> 02:24.200
Mm. You ARE cold.

02:24.200 --> 02:27.320
I'm gonna have to bring
home some flannel jammies.

02:27.320 --> 02:30.520
Or you could move in.

02:30.520 --> 02:33.440
I thought we slammed
the gate on that subject.

02:33.440 --> 02:35.240
Shacking up's a cop-out.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.440
OK.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.000
Why don't you marry me then?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.040
&lt; What?

02:40.040 --> 02:42.240
You know I can't hear
you with the water running.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.720
I said marry me.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.600
     That's not what you want.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.600
We're getting older, you know.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.320
Not much time left if we
want little kiddies. Hm?

02:51.320 --> 02:55.320
                No.

02:55.360 --> 02:57.160
             Stop it.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.200
               Stop!

02:59.200 --> 03:02.800
Come on. Come on,
we can make cute little babies.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.760
My profile,

03:04.760 --> 03:08.600
your hairline. Yes?

03:08.600 --> 03:12.600
You're wasting water.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.680
I'll make coffee.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.920
     Break it up! Come on now!

03:22.920 --> 03:25.160
All right, on your way.

03:25.160 --> 03:26.400
You know the drill.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.960
I always do everything you tell me.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.200
Yeah, I'm sure. Bye!

03:31.200 --> 03:34.240
So long, Doc.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.720
Old girlfriend?

03:35.720 --> 03:37.360
Lula?

03:37.360 --> 03:39.880
Comes in every month
               like clockwork -

03:39.880 --> 03:42.960
hypertension, emphysema, loneliness.

03:42.960 --> 03:46.360
I run some tests, suggest some meds,
keep her company.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.640
Gotta go, OBGYN rounds with Turner.

03:48.640 --> 03:52.640
Watch out in case the water breaks.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.360
Willy McLintock

03:55.360 --> 03:59.360
                Me.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.600
What happened?

04:02.600 --> 04:06.000
      Squirrel on the road, swerved,

04:06.000 --> 04:09.960
dumped my Super Glide,
50 feet of blacked-out body massage.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.800
Lucky squirrel.

04:11.800 --> 04:15.800
Yeah, and I thought I
had him nailed for sure.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.320
Right this way.

04:19.320 --> 04:20.959
Controlling costs in ER is essential

04:20.959 --> 04:23.040
if we're gonna save this
place from the auction.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.600
We have to convince the mayor
that we can cut the deficit.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.640
I'll look through my
               end of the proposal.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.800
Lunch in my office.
We'll go over the numbers.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.240
The decision to sell couldn't
      have come at a worse time.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.680
Is there a good time?

04:33.680 --> 04:37.680
For me personally, in the middle
   of my chemo cycle - wooziness,

04:37.760 --> 04:41.760
trouble concentrating, not the
  match for City Hall I used to be.

04:51.360 --> 04:55.040
Helen, you look like you've
been rowed hard and put away wet.

04:55.040 --> 04:55.960
Pardon?

04:55.960 --> 04:58.000
Pardon?
               Old Greek expression.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.680
I've been cleaning house all week.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.920
Marci and her husband
are coming home today.

05:01.920 --> 05:04.800
It's the first time they've been
Stateside since they married.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.320
Luckily, Richard's taking all
the other kids shopping in Maine,

05:08.320 --> 05:11.360
so we'll get to spend
some time together.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.880
       You like your new son-in-law?

05:12.880 --> 05:14.880
Klaus is sweet -
owns Brinkman's Chocolates.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.680
      Ooh, a candy mogul! Lucky you!

05:17.680 --> 05:20.640
Mother's Day must be a
bonbon bonanza.

05:20.640 --> 05:24.640
Dad, what did the doctor say?

05:28.080 --> 05:30.440
That was my father,
rushed the conversation.

05:30.440 --> 05:31.960
He's coming up from Marshfield.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.960
              Veterinarians Day off?

05:33.960 --> 05:36.760
He's coming for chemotherapy.

05:36.760 --> 05:40.760
My dad's got cancer.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.640
No insurance?

05:47.640 --> 05:50.200
Strictly for vics.

05:50.200 --> 05:53.320
Victims? Civilians?

05:53.320 --> 05:54.360
What do you do?

05:54.360 --> 05:58.360
A little of this,
a little of that - push, pimp, trick.

05:59.720 --> 06:00.360
Headache?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.680
Headache?
        Yeah.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.560
Were you wearing your helmet?

06:03.560 --> 06:06.760
On a Harley? Give me a break!

06:06.760 --> 06:08.040
Lose consciousness?

06:08.040 --> 06:11.760
For a second. I don't remember. You
gonna give me something for the pain?

06:11.760 --> 06:12.800
Maybe.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.000
     Percodans?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.040
     Percodans?
We'll see.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.600
      I like percs.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.560
Does it hurt here?

06:17.560 --> 06:18.960
Does it hurt here?
   Yeah.

06:18.960 --> 06:22.760
OK. Stoic-type.

06:22.760 --> 06:25.640
  No way!

06:25.640 --> 06:27.920
Could be a concussion,
a few cracked ribs.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.360
I'll run some tests, get a
   chest X-ray, keep you overnight.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.760
Just give me the dope
and let me blow this rat hole.

06:33.760 --> 06:37.760
A head injury is no joke.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.760
  You a Jew?

06:39.760 --> 06:41.600
I'm Jewish.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.240
You're supposed to
make the best doctors,

06:44.240 --> 06:48.240
and the worst wine.

06:52.760 --> 06:56.760
HAWKS

07:00.640 --> 07:03.680
     Elliott, check this out.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.440
Father is checking out.

07:05.440 --> 07:06.480
             Bank statement.

07:06.480 --> 07:07.840
Leukaemia at his age!

07:07.840 --> 07:10.440
This morning, I dropped
by the automatic teller.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.960
I withdrew 20 bucks.
When I got the receipt,

07:12.960 --> 07:16.960
my account had been credited
102,000 smackers.

07:18.360 --> 07:22.360
Of course, I'm gonna call
and tell them, but it's fun.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.360
You know, you make me puke.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.040
Not everyone cares about your

07:26.040 --> 07:29.320
stupid savings account or your
stupid life, for that matter.

07:29.320 --> 07:33.320
                So what? I'm rich!

07:42.440 --> 07:46.440
That's it? That's the heart?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.800
Beating like a little tom-tom.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.120
Wild!

07:51.120 --> 07:53.520
Henry didn't want me
to have this procedure.

07:53.520 --> 07:56.560
No-one's positive ultrasound's
safe for the foetus.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.920
You're so sweet and concerned.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.480
                Mrs Orr is 43.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.400
Late pregnancies have added
risks of birth defects.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.480
A good idea to look for
problems on the sonogram.

08:07.480 --> 08:10.200
If I'm only gonna have one with
Angie, I want it to be perfect.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.240
Not fair to the child
to continue the pregnancy

08:12.240 --> 08:13.360
if there's anything wrong.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.520
Passed your amniocentesis
with flying colours.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.880
Genetically, your baby is fine.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.120
Look at this, Angie!

08:21.120 --> 08:24.840
I've seen it before, honey.
This is Henry's first.

08:24.840 --> 08:26.880
I have two by a previous marriage.

08:26.880 --> 08:27.920
I have two by a previous marriage.
Wild!

08:27.920 --> 08:29.040
                       See that?

08:29.040 --> 08:31.000
What?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.400
                     There.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.280
                  Anything?

08:34.280 --> 08:36.280
A little blurry is all.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.880
Looks fine to me.

08:37.880 --> 08:40.919
Are you sure?

08:40.919 --> 08:44.600
I'll go over the film again
and call you if anything turns up.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.960
Otherwise you are in good shape,

08:47.960 --> 08:51.960
and I have a full delivery schedule.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.080
Dad! Dad! Dad!

09:02.080 --> 09:03.400
DOG BARKS

09:03.400 --> 09:07.400
Damn it, Elliott! You're slobbering
and tangling up Jinks' leash.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.320
Good girl.

09:09.320 --> 09:10.360
How bad is it?

09:10.360 --> 09:13.600
Bad. Mangiosarcoma metastasize.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.240
Oh, no!

09:15.240 --> 09:17.560
Stand up straight!

09:17.560 --> 09:21.320
Dad, I called the other night
on the phone and there was all

09:21.320 --> 09:23.440
this crying
in the background. Mum?

09:23.440 --> 09:24.640
Jinks.

09:24.640 --> 09:26.120
WHINES

09:26.120 --> 09:28.240
He knows about the cancer?

09:28.240 --> 09:30.560
She, of course.

09:30.560 --> 09:34.400
Well, I guess dogs just
sense that kind of stuff.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.960
Jinks is in a lot of pain.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.520
I'd like to start her on

09:37.520 --> 09:40.320
cisplatinum and adreomycin
         treatments stat.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.760
What for?

09:41.760 --> 09:44.240
Elliott. Weren't you listening
     when I called?

09:44.240 --> 09:46.720
You said you were coming
here for chemotherapy.

09:46.720 --> 09:47.800
For Jinks!

09:47.800 --> 09:50.840
WHINES

09:50.840 --> 09:52.200
Thank God!

09:52.200 --> 09:53.200
You're happy she's sick?

09:53.200 --> 09:55.240
You're happy she's sick?
No, of course not.

09:55.240 --> 09:59.240
I'm just happy you're not.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.560
Let's get inside.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.600
Come on, girl.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.640
BARKS

10:03.640 --> 10:05.320
We can't treat a dog here.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.760
I OKed it with Dr Westphall.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.560
You called Dr Westphall?

10:09.560 --> 10:12.640
My clinic doesn't have
the facilities for chemo.

10:12.640 --> 10:15.480
Dad, is Jinks housebroken?

10:15.480 --> 10:18.000
Better than you were at eight.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
Come on, baby!

10:27.040 --> 10:29.200
Hello.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.040
        Well, I'll bet you're Klaus.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.080
        Well, I'll bet you're Klaus.
Yes.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.920
Lucy Papandrao.
Welcome to Boston.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.520
Thank you.
So different from Zurich.

10:36.520 --> 10:39.400
You mean dirty,
run-down, depressing?

10:39.400 --> 10:41.880
No, lived in.
Swiss cleanliness is make-believe.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.760
The world isn't
gingerbread with marzipan.

10:43.760 --> 10:47.200
Boston could use a little bit
more fantasy. So could this place.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.240
Actually, I feel at home
in a hospital.

10:49.240 --> 10:52.520
My father and brother run the
Schwarzwald clinic in West Germany.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.200
Klaus!

10:54.200 --> 10:55.720
Excuse me.

10:55.720 --> 10:59.480
It's good to see you.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.520
Where's Marci?

11:00.520 --> 11:03.200
She stopped off in the
cafeteria for a bite.

11:03.200 --> 11:07.200
I wanted to come ahead and
speak with you first about Marci.

11:07.880 --> 11:08.880
I'm worried.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.240
I'm worried.
Is she sick?

11:10.240 --> 11:12.880
No, no.
She's healthy as a house.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.400
House?

11:14.400 --> 11:16.960
Helen, your little girl has

11:16.960 --> 11:19.600
changed some since
you saw her last. She's...

11:19.600 --> 11:23.600
&lt; Ma!

11:28.520 --> 11:32.520
CLASSICAL MUSIC

11:40.240 --> 11:44.240
BARK

11:45.720 --> 11:49.720
BARK

12:15.680 --> 12:17.720
Snub the butt.

12:17.720 --> 12:21.720
Mmm, the chick's tough.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.920
These percs are the pits.

12:23.920 --> 12:24.920
     Complain to your doctor.

12:24.920 --> 12:27.440
     Complain to your doctor.
Ow! That hurts.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.000
     Pill.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.040
     Pill.
What?

12:29.040 --> 12:30.360
            Take that.

12:30.360 --> 12:33.800
            Take that.
Oh.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.400
You're cute.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.880
Blonde all over?

12:38.880 --> 12:41.560
Look, you do that one more
time and you'll wish you hadn't.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.280
I like it when you say no.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.960
Problem here?

12:44.960 --> 12:46.480
   Yeah, you're looking at him.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.200
LAUGHS

12:48.200 --> 12:49.880
Don't hassle the nurses, OK?

12:49.880 --> 12:52.880
Uptight lame.

12:52.880 --> 12:56.320
I thought you people
were supposed be so hip.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.440
Your X-rays show you have three
broken ribs on the left side.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.800
Tape me up.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.280
No, we don't do that anymore.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.760
The ribs will heal on their own.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.440
Somebody will take you up
for a CAT scan real soon, OK?

13:06.440 --> 13:07.440
I want the Jew back.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.600
I want the Jew back.
Excuse me?

13:08.600 --> 13:12.080
The one down in ER -
you know, a second opinion.

13:12.080 --> 13:14.160
I don't think you know
what you're talking about.

13:14.160 --> 13:18.080
Look, when they brought you up
here, you became my patient.

13:18.080 --> 13:22.080
You may not like that, neither do I,
but while you're up here,

13:22.800 --> 13:26.800
try and act as if you evolved,
like the rest of us.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.120
                              There.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.680
      That's what I spotted earlier.

13:35.680 --> 13:38.680
It looks like a small
hole in the ventricle.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.840
The septal defect.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.280
Yeah, I saw it too.

13:43.280 --> 13:46.160
How come you didn't tell the Orrs?

13:46.160 --> 13:49.960
That's something important to
learn during your OB rotation.

13:49.960 --> 13:52.680
Don't communicate alarm.

13:52.680 --> 13:53.960
You panic the parents.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.120
                   They should know.

13:55.120 --> 13:58.120
You heard that couple.
They're looking for perfection.

13:58.120 --> 14:01.240
The minute they find out
there's anything wrong with their

14:01.240 --> 14:04.280
dream baby, even minor, they're
gonna hit the ejection button.

14:04.280 --> 14:08.160
So you're not gonna
tell them anything?

14:08.160 --> 14:10.320
I'll assess
further down the road.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.240
After it's too late
for a legal abortion.

14:12.240 --> 14:15.040
You're a rookie resident, Carol.

14:15.040 --> 14:19.040
Until you've been around,
don't lay a crusade on me.

14:26.920 --> 14:30.480
Mmm! Oh, real Swiss hot
chocolate is to die for.

14:30.480 --> 14:33.600
Nowhere in the world do they
make a finer cup of cocoa.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.960
Rumpelmeyer's in New York

14:34.960 --> 14:37.320
has excellent hot chocolate
with real whipped cream.

14:37.320 --> 14:40.320
Klaus, you don't have to
play the polite tourist.

14:40.320 --> 14:44.120
Mother, did you know that the Swiss
perfected milk chocolate in 1876?

14:44.120 --> 14:46.240
I guess I'd forgotten.

14:46.240 --> 14:50.120
I mean, I ask you - why
fool around with imitations?

14:50.120 --> 14:54.080
American chocolate is full of
emulsifiers, made fast and cheap for

14:54.080 --> 14:57.400
maximum profit, like everything
else in this tasteless country.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.400
Guglehupf, that
is a little harsh.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.320
Yes, but true.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.080
 Klaus already does the classics -

15:03.080 --> 15:07.000
Brinkman's white chocolate
with raspberry liqueur.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.720
Oh, and his dark chocolate
almond bark - it's world famous.

15:10.720 --> 15:13.600
You overrate me,
my little cocoa butt.

15:13.600 --> 15:17.360
He's so dedicated,
and beloved by his workers.

15:17.360 --> 15:21.360
Klaus often goes down to the factory
himself to help them pack the fudge.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.600
And what do you do?

15:23.600 --> 15:26.840
Marci has been
       working as a taster.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.320
Ah! Now I understand.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.960
She has a sensitive snout.

15:29.960 --> 15:33.440
She can sniff out a stale
Grand Marnier truffle at 50 metres.

15:33.440 --> 15:37.440
And I have all kinds of ideas
for new products, novelty items.

15:37.600 --> 15:41.600
Carol, I need a medication
         change, please.

15:41.800 --> 15:42.920
      Hi, Elliott.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.200
Hi.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.960
Marci? Hi!

15:46.960 --> 15:48.760
I didn't recognise you.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.760
You look the same.

15:50.760 --> 15:53.800
You don't.

15:53.800 --> 15:57.640
Last time I saw you, we'd gone
on diets together, I had gained.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.120
Yeah, and I lost.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.320
I know - a lot.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.880
You were gorgeous, slim and trim.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.360
I was not.
I've never been trim in my life.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.400
You were positively svelte -
wasn't she?

16:08.400 --> 16:11.520
You were luscious when
we got married.

16:11.520 --> 16:12.560
Congratulations.

16:12.560 --> 16:13.920
You must be Klaus.
I'm Elliott Axlerod.

16:13.920 --> 16:14.960
You must be Klaus.
I'm Elliott Axlerod.
How do you do?

16:14.960 --> 16:18.560
Probably a good yodeller, huh?

16:18.560 --> 16:20.360
        Anybody want more?

16:20.360 --> 16:24.360
               I do.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.560
Sure you won't join me?

16:29.560 --> 16:33.560
No thanks. After chemo, food
has all the appeal of root canal.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.800
I wonder if it affects
a dog's appetite!

16:39.000 --> 16:42.160
  These figures boggle the mind.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.680
Our emergency room treats
70,000 patients a year.

16:45.680 --> 16:49.680
Half of them don't have insurance and
the other half can't or won't pay.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.760
If we're to convince the mayor not to

16:51.760 --> 16:54.880
sell the hospital, we have to show
them we can change our ER policies.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.800
St Eligius has a strong commitment
to care for the poor.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.520
Now, that very commitment
is what threatens its survival.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.240
    The good neighbour policy.

17:02.240 --> 17:05.400
I know this report was my idea.
But the scope of these changes.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.720
I'd hate like hell to start
weighing compassion against cost.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.319
We've already lost
time with the mayor.

17:11.319 --> 17:14.200
We help no one if we become
the victims of our own charity.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.160
I wanna lay down new
admission guidelines.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.319
The trick is to make
some tough decisions

17:18.319 --> 17:20.079
without losing our humanity.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.560
Let's do it, Daniel.
If we have to compromise

17:22.560 --> 17:25.160
the care we give, to hell with it.
What's the point?

17:25.160 --> 17:29.160
Let them sell the damn place!

17:35.440 --> 17:37.200
I can pay off my student loan.

17:37.200 --> 17:41.200
I can buy mutual funds, invest
in tax-free bonds, start saving.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.760
Jack, you're not thinking
of keeping that money!

17:43.760 --> 17:45.800
No, no, I mean, no.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.160
It wouldn't be ethical.
It has crossed my mind.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.280
How can you think that?
It's only a matter

17:50.280 --> 17:52.040
of time before they
find the error.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.120
I could transfer it
            to an interest account.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.160
Spend that money, you're in deep.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.680
Spend that money, you're in deep.
No, of course, you're right.

17:56.680 --> 18:00.280
Besides, what with your brother,
the cop, say?

18:00.280 --> 18:02.680
Sorry I'm late,
someone stole my watch.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.160
            Did you tell the police?

18:04.160 --> 18:07.560
Yeah, they said they
admire the guy's bravado.

18:07.560 --> 18:11.560
Come on, anyway, you
can have a nice run.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.240
Klaus, what happened to her?

18:14.240 --> 18:17.160
Most tasters get sick of chocolate.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.720
Not Marcy.

18:18.720 --> 18:22.080
When she samples a batch, she
doesn't just nibble a single piece,

18:22.080 --> 18:24.760
she downs a dozen.

18:24.760 --> 18:26.760
Look, this is
               a delicate question.

18:26.760 --> 18:29.120
Food can sometimes
be a compensation...

18:29.120 --> 18:30.160
Say no more.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.680
When I first knew Marcy,
she was toothsome - delicious.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.840
I couldn't get enough.
Then she became softie.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.080
Fine by me. So scrumptious.

18:39.080 --> 18:43.080
Then she grew to be Rubenesque -
still OK. I loved her more.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.120
There was more to love.

18:46.120 --> 18:50.120
But now she's, um,
what's the word? Um...pachyderm.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.600
Have you talked to her?

18:51.600 --> 18:53.800
Constantly. But how many
times can you say,

18:53.800 --> 18:57.800
sweetheart, don't you think
   you've had enough?

18:59.760 --> 19:01.760
Helen, I will pay for anything -

19:01.760 --> 19:04.840
stomach staple,
fat suction, aversion therapy.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.920
I'm sure that between the two
of us, we can convince her...

19:06.920 --> 19:09.200
I'm sure that between the two
of us, we can convince her...
Damn it. I feel responsible.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.240
I offered the first lick.

19:11.240 --> 19:14.200
The taste of the
candied forbidden fruit.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.160
Now she's a chocoholic.

19:16.160 --> 19:19.200
I love Marcy but I can't
live with her any longer.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.440
What?

19:20.440 --> 19:22.800
Ya, I'm unable to change,
meine kleine Frau.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.080
That is why I'm leaving
her here with you

19:25.080 --> 19:26.880
and I'm returning
to Zurich tomorrow.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.920
Helen, you must help her.

19:29.920 --> 19:33.920
Or I don't wish to see
your daughter again.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.880
Remember when the sky

19:38.880 --> 19:42.880
was just twinkling stars
and the man in the moon?

19:44.440 --> 19:48.440
Now, there are black holes, pulsars,
supernovas and all kinds of junk.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.400
                  Let's keep moving.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.320
Everything is more complicated now.

19:56.320 --> 20:00.320
I can turn on a machine
and look inside the womb.

20:01.160 --> 20:05.160
It forces parents to deal with
things they never had to before.

20:05.360 --> 20:08.440
Pre-natal diagnosis can save
a lot of trouble later on.

20:08.440 --> 20:12.280
Sometimes. Sometimes,
I find a problem that's

20:12.280 --> 20:16.280
not serious and the parents become
frightened and decide to abort.

20:16.920 --> 20:17.640
      Nothing you can do about that.

20:17.640 --> 20:21.600
      Nothing you can do about that.
Yeah.

20:21.600 --> 20:25.360
Just who is my patient here exactly?

20:25.360 --> 20:28.760
The mother, yes, but,

20:28.760 --> 20:30.320
I'm watching the ultrasound.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.320
This little thing is bopping around.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.560
Does it become my patient too?

20:34.560 --> 20:36.360
Toss in the father for good measure.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.800
Who's most important?

20:38.800 --> 20:42.800
It's simple. All three.
Come on, faster. Faster.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.160
I can't keep up
this marathon pace.

20:46.160 --> 20:50.160
Come on.
Push, push, push.

20:50.760 --> 20:54.720
  So, what are you trying to say?

20:54.720 --> 20:58.040
I prefer the good
old country doctor approach.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.560
Yep. URPG was never invented.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.480
Come back and see me
in nine months.

21:02.480 --> 21:05.480
Hey, don't trip off the porch!

21:05.480 --> 21:09.480
Ah! Sh...! Ah!

21:09.760 --> 21:12.520
Cramp.

21:12.520 --> 21:16.120
          All right. Flex your foot.

21:16.120 --> 21:19.480
Patients have the right to know
everything we can tell them.

21:19.480 --> 21:23.480
I could be risking the future
of the foetus unnecessarily.

21:23.520 --> 21:26.760
Well, making a personal decision
that can affect a lot of lives

21:26.760 --> 21:28.320
                    is not up to us.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.760
What is?

21:29.760 --> 21:31.200
                          The truth.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.240
             Come on.

21:34.240 --> 21:38.240
The liver appears to be
shrunken and cirrhotic.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.560
Oh, here you are.

21:41.560 --> 21:42.600
Oh, here you are.
Dad!

21:42.600 --> 21:44.080
What are you doing
in the morgue?

21:44.080 --> 21:46.880
The pathologist was fired for
selling body parts. I'm filling

21:46.880 --> 21:49.640
in evenings to earn extra money.
   You should get her out of here.

21:49.640 --> 21:53.200
Relax, buddy boy.
She'll be a perfect lady.

21:53.200 --> 21:56.680
You know, you're doing a terrible
job. Make those incisions smoother.

21:56.680 --> 22:00.240
You know, Dr Auschlander came to me
and chewed me out about Jinks.

22:00.240 --> 22:03.680
The old goat acted like an
ass and I told him so.

22:03.680 --> 22:04.760
The old goat acted like an
ass and I told him so.
Great!

22:04.760 --> 22:08.280
How can anyone get angry with
anything as sweet as she is.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.200
Look at her!

22:10.200 --> 22:12.960
Dad, please take Jinks home.
I'm really very busy.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.880
A couple from Cohasset left Jinks

22:14.880 --> 22:18.320
at my veterinary office -
never came back. She's been with me

22:18.320 --> 22:21.560
now for about five months.
You know the sewing room...

22:21.560 --> 22:23.200
Yes, my old room.

22:23.200 --> 22:26.800
Ah, right! Your mother moved
a bed in there for herself.

22:26.800 --> 22:30.040
So, Jinks and I are
in the master room.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.720
She sleeps next to me.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.040
Moaning, breaking wind.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.360
Not very much different
than your mother really.

22:35.360 --> 22:37.400
Snores less.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.840
Well, see you tomorrow.
Early's best for me.

22:39.840 --> 22:40.880
Well, see you tomorrow.
Early's best for me.
What for?

22:40.880 --> 22:43.960
For Jinks' chemo. How often are
we going to have this conversation?

22:43.960 --> 22:45.480
You're bringing her back!

22:45.480 --> 22:49.440
Of course, dummy.
She's on a two day drug cycle.

22:49.440 --> 22:50.560
But Dad!

22:50.560 --> 22:52.320
See you about nine.

22:52.320 --> 22:55.360
Here you go, come on, here.

22:55.360 --> 22:58.640
Dad, no, please. Oh, no!

22:58.640 --> 23:00.280
Liver. High in iron.

23:00.280 --> 23:04.280
Come on! Come on, come on, baby.
Is that good?

23:18.560 --> 23:20.320
Bad dream?

23:20.320 --> 23:23.240
The geezer in next
bed's got sewer gas.

23:23.240 --> 23:26.880
Well, please accept the
management's heartfelt apologies.

23:26.880 --> 23:29.920
No complaints. This is like Walpole.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.560
           Lunch, dinner, colour TV.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.720
And the public foots the bill.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.920
                   Boo freaking hoo!

23:36.920 --> 23:40.720
I'll remember you in April
when I'm paying taxes.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.360
I knew a nurse
who liked to party.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.080
               Do you like to party?

23:45.080 --> 23:46.680
         You've got the lips for it.

23:46.680 --> 23:48.640
Yeah?
Read them.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.160
Take a hike.

23:50.160 --> 23:54.160
BUZZER

23:54.680 --> 23:58.680
Code Blue, room 3310.

24:17.960 --> 24:21.360
Mmm.

24:21.360 --> 24:25.360
Mmm!

24:25.560 --> 24:28.440
Mum, hi!

24:28.440 --> 24:29.640
Just needed a little nosh.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.400
Just needed a little nosh.
Truffles at three in the morning.

24:31.400 --> 24:35.360
Well, it's, um,
breakfast time in Switzerland.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.320
Would you like one?

24:37.320 --> 24:39.760
Klaus is leaving you tomorrow.

24:39.760 --> 24:40.800
I know.

24:40.800 --> 24:44.000
And he won't come back until you
go on the wagon and lose weight.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.480
He's just being
             European and dramatic.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.160
Klaus is right. You have a problem.

24:49.160 --> 24:53.160
I'm happy.
I've just let go a little.

24:53.400 --> 24:54.440
You're enormous.

24:54.440 --> 24:57.120
That's a sweet thing to
say to your daughter.

24:57.120 --> 25:00.200
Marcy, you need help.
You're addicted to chocolate.

25:00.200 --> 25:03.760
I am not. I can quit any time.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.800
Are you going to wait until you're
the size of the Hindenburg

25:06.800 --> 25:09.760
and your husband is tickling
another woman's Alps?

25:09.760 --> 25:11.040
My Klaus can't live without me.

25:11.040 --> 25:12.640
My Klaus can't live without me.
Believe me, Marcy.

25:12.640 --> 25:16.640
If you don't fight
for your marriage,
   you can kiss Klaus goodbye.

25:17.160 --> 25:19.880
You're one to talk.
Four marriages, four divorces.

25:19.880 --> 25:23.160
Just as we started getting used to
one stepfather, there'd be some new

25:23.160 --> 25:25.920
guy at the breakfast table
and another half sibling on the way.

25:25.920 --> 25:29.400
Maybe if you'd spent a little bit
more time with your first husband,

25:29.400 --> 25:32.320
dad, and with me, I
wouldn't be so screwed up.

25:32.320 --> 25:36.320
I worked full-time,
kept a home, offered advice,

25:38.280 --> 25:40.600
never stood in the way.

25:40.600 --> 25:44.600
You've moped around this house since
puberty and then, suddenly, bam,

25:44.920 --> 25:48.240
off to Switzerland, into marriage
and all you sent was a candy gram.

25:48.240 --> 25:52.000
It's time you took responsibility
for your problems instead of burying

25:52.000 --> 25:54.040
them under layers of blubber.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.320
You're right.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.000
I'm going cold turkey, right now,

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
because the last thing in the
world I ever wanna be like is you!

26:10.840 --> 26:14.840
(ANNOUNCER) Nurse Spears OR2.
Nurse Julie Spears, OR2.

26:33.360 --> 26:37.360
                 Full up!

26:42.560 --> 26:46.320
Phil, when do you
start life as a POSSLQ?

26:46.320 --> 26:49.320
Don't get anagrammatical
so early in the day.

26:49.320 --> 26:53.320
POSSLQ - persons of opposite sex
sharing living quarters.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.200
It's a census term for cohabitating.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.960
Right!

26:57.960 --> 27:01.120
I didn't know you are and Roxanne
were ready to live together.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.160
We aren't. Well, we are.

27:03.160 --> 27:04.880
At least one of us is.
Oh, by the way,

27:04.880 --> 27:08.880
thank you for that scum bucket
ER admission, Willy McLintock!

27:09.840 --> 27:11.800
Motorcycle accident, anti-Semite.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.480
Right, a racist. Misogynist. Thief.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.960
He tried to rip off
someone's purse last night.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.600
Shouldn't have admitted him.

27:18.600 --> 27:21.560
Because he's a jerk?
He had a head injury.

27:21.560 --> 27:25.440
All the results came back negative
today so I'm releasing him.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.640
Boomer, heard about the windfall!

27:27.640 --> 27:29.840
102,000, that's something!

27:29.840 --> 27:33.400
What did the bank
say when you called?

27:33.400 --> 27:35.040
       Nothing, I haven't told them.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.680
Jack!

27:36.680 --> 27:39.400
They made a mistake.
They put the money in my account.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.960
So...?

27:41.960 --> 27:44.240
           Now it's mine.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.440
             All mine.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.080
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

27:47.080 --> 27:49.160
Nobody will buy that, Jack.

27:49.160 --> 27:53.160
Especially the police.

27:54.720 --> 27:57.040
Maybe that money was
put there for a reason.

27:57.040 --> 28:01.040
Boomer, this isn't,
It's A Wonderful Life

28:01.440 --> 28:05.440
and you're not Jimmy Stewart.

28:13.560 --> 28:16.920
Ah!

28:16.920 --> 28:20.920
Oops! A little help please.

28:25.880 --> 28:28.200
Oof! Ugly shoes.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.400
Thanks.

28:29.400 --> 28:32.520
         And you, Elliot?

28:32.520 --> 28:34.240
Dr Westphall. Yes, sir.

28:34.240 --> 28:37.880
The man the Collie I saw in the
elevator today, your father?

28:37.880 --> 28:40.240
Yes, sir. The man that is.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.360
       What's he doing here?

28:41.360 --> 28:44.000
Canine chemotherapy,
remember he discussed it with you.?

28:44.000 --> 28:45.600
    Yes, I do. I told him, no.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.320
What?

28:47.320 --> 28:50.360
Elliott, it's obvious your
father's very fond of that dog.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.160
But this hospital's under the gun.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.320
We can't treat animals
and turn people away.

28:54.320 --> 28:55.320
But he told me...

28:55.320 --> 28:56.720
But he told me...
      What really gets to me

28:56.720 --> 28:59.080
is you're allowing your father to
use these facilities behind my back.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.160
is you're allowing your father to
use these facilities behind my back.
But Sir!

29:00.160 --> 29:02.920
I don't appreciate
being ignored, Elliott.

29:02.920 --> 29:04.480
You send your father and
that dog on their way.

29:04.480 --> 29:06.480
You send your father and
that dog on their way.
If you'd let me explain...

29:06.480 --> 29:08.040
            Elliott...

29:08.040 --> 29:09.800
Yes, I know, Sir.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.080
Quit while I'm ahead.

29:11.080 --> 29:15.080
         You're too late!

29:17.200 --> 29:19.760
Lucy, I've got a
pregnant mother with angina.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.760
I can't find Dr Craig for a consult.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.240
Probably because he's
up in Vermont mourning.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.200
Who died?

29:25.200 --> 29:26.800
Who died?
Mrs Craig's mother.

29:26.800 --> 29:29.120
A bizarre story.
It couldn't be true.

29:29.120 --> 29:31.840
But word is, Dr Craig sent his
mother-in-law a box containing

29:31.840 --> 29:33.840
a human head for a birthday present.

29:33.840 --> 29:34.920
What!

29:34.920 --> 29:38.920
The old lady opens up the package
and drops dead from a heart attack.

29:49.040 --> 29:52.280
The hole usually
        closes on its own.

29:52.280 --> 29:53.560
        What if it doesn't?

29:53.560 --> 29:57.560
The ventricle can be repaired
surgically soon after birth.

29:57.600 --> 30:01.600
Surgery, on a new born?
     Isn't that dangerous?

30:02.280 --> 30:03.320
Possibly.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.960
 What's the worst that can happen?

30:05.960 --> 30:08.520
Stillbirth.

30:08.520 --> 30:12.440
The baby's inability to
tolerate an operation -

30:12.440 --> 30:16.440
the rare chance that this defect is
related to others we haven't found.

30:17.240 --> 30:19.040
Dr Turner, can you guarantee

30:19.040 --> 30:22.160
our baby will be able
to live a normal life?

30:22.160 --> 30:25.480
No.

30:25.480 --> 30:29.080
Henry and I really want
to have a child together.

30:29.080 --> 30:32.120
But there's no
reason to take chances.

30:32.120 --> 30:36.040
I already have two beautiful,
  healthy daughters.

30:36.040 --> 30:40.040
Henry...

30:40.200 --> 30:44.200
We can't afford endless
hospitalisation on my coverage.

30:44.520 --> 30:48.080
If this child needs constant care,
Angie and I are going to be

30:48.080 --> 30:50.280
  hard pressed to find the money.

30:50.280 --> 30:53.920
It will just deprive the other kids.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.360
I'm sorry, honey.

30:56.360 --> 30:58.320
Before you decide,

30:58.320 --> 31:01.680
you aren't perfect.

31:01.680 --> 31:04.080
After any kid is born,
you have to give some

31:04.080 --> 31:06.200
latitude for problems it might have.

31:06.200 --> 31:10.200
Give this one some latitude now.

31:10.240 --> 31:12.920
I think Angie and I have
already decided, Dr Turner.

31:12.920 --> 31:14.360
We have the right to choose.

31:14.360 --> 31:18.360
Yes, you do have the right.

31:19.680 --> 31:23.680
Then we'd like to
terminate the pregnancy.

31:28.240 --> 31:29.880
Well, if it isn't the lucky saver.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.640
So, how's the good life?

31:31.640 --> 31:32.920
Not so good.

31:32.920 --> 31:34.320
Oh, what's the matter?

31:34.320 --> 31:36.400
Get a hernia trying to
smuggle out your fortune?

31:36.400 --> 31:38.320
The bank discovered the error.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.160
Well, it was only a matter of time.

31:40.160 --> 31:43.240
They debited my account
for the full amount.

31:43.240 --> 31:46.200
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

31:46.200 --> 31:50.200
Plus they charged
me ¤6 handling fee.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.080
Dad, I need to talk to you.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.240
Come on, Jinks.
Here, girl. It's good. Look!

31:59.240 --> 32:00.280
Come here!

32:00.280 --> 32:02.040
I get your point.

32:02.040 --> 32:04.000
Dad, I said I need to talk to you.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.120
        Shut up, will you?

32:05.120 --> 32:07.120
No. I need to speak to you

32:07.120 --> 32:09.640
outside of this room
and outside of this building.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.400
It's too cold out for
a dog in her condition.

32:12.400 --> 32:15.600
She's been withdrawn all morning.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.880
Here, draw 10 CCs.

32:17.880 --> 32:18.920
Dad!

32:18.920 --> 32:20.720
     Jinks isn't feeling well.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.680
Draw the drug, you know what to do.
Hop to it.

32:22.680 --> 32:26.160
She's in pain. She's weak, anaemic.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.840
That chemo probably can't
stop the internal bleeding.

32:28.840 --> 32:32.600
Dad, let's forget but the dog
right now. It's you. You lied to me.

32:32.600 --> 32:35.600
Give me that.

32:35.600 --> 32:36.920
This will help you, girl.

32:36.920 --> 32:40.200
You told me Dr Westphall
OKed Jinks' chemotherapy.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.280
Now I'm in the doghouse with him.

32:42.280 --> 32:43.960
    Don't worry. No more hurt.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.760
Besides, what's it gonna look like,

32:45.760 --> 32:48.160
my father dragging a
Collie around the hospital?

32:48.160 --> 32:50.200
I am with you, puppy.

32:50.200 --> 32:53.800
Dad, I'm a resident here. I have
to work here every single day.

32:53.800 --> 32:57.320
You didn't take me into account.
You paraded around this hospital

32:57.320 --> 32:59.080
like you owned it.
You embarrassed me.

32:59.080 --> 33:03.080
Those bunnies you used to chase,
never quite wanting to catch.

33:03.680 --> 33:06.800
  Those long walks in the woods,

33:06.800 --> 33:08.960
your coat fall of ticks.

33:08.960 --> 33:12.960
Clipping your claws and watching
your eyes cloud with cataracts.

33:18.240 --> 33:19.800
What was that?

33:19.800 --> 33:23.800
I had to put Jinks to sleep.
She's dead.

33:26.840 --> 33:27.880
She is?

33:27.880 --> 33:31.120
 She'll be warm for an hour or so.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.720
           Soft, still -

33:33.720 --> 33:36.560
     Collie smell in her fur.

33:36.560 --> 33:40.240
  She won't be in pain any more.

33:40.240 --> 33:44.240
       A bientot, old girl.

33:46.240 --> 33:50.240
What are you staring at?

34:01.960 --> 34:05.960
Klaus seemed sad this morning,
Marcy. When he went off to Logan.

34:09.520 --> 34:13.520
Actually, it's nice that we're
alone. We need time to talk.

34:15.639 --> 34:18.840
I took the day off to be with you.

34:18.840 --> 34:21.520
Marcy?!

34:21.520 --> 34:23.719
Marcy, are you all right?

34:23.719 --> 34:24.120
LOUD THUD

34:24.120 --> 34:25.159
LOUD THUD
Marcy!

34:25.159 --> 34:29.159
Oh! I'm coming in.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.440
My God!

34:32.440 --> 34:35.639
Marcy!

34:35.639 --> 34:39.639
Oh, baby!

34:51.199 --> 34:54.000
26-year-old woman,
probably aspirated chocolate.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.760
 She collapsed, stopped breathing.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.760
Push that back to the ward.

35:00.160 --> 35:02.680
I performed the Heimlich,
did mouth-to-mouth,

35:02.680 --> 35:04.600
she started breathing
again - took a while.

35:04.600 --> 35:07.800
We found her conscious but
lethargic with severe bronchospasm.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.160
Get her on six litres O2 by mask.

35:09.160 --> 35:11.160
Breathe deeply, Marcy. Relax.

35:11.160 --> 35:14.400
0.1 mgs.
Blood gases, chest X-ray.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.480
We gave her 400 mgs aminophylin,
which is about halfway in.

35:16.480 --> 35:20.480
OK. Call respiratory therapy.
  Tell 'em stat treatment.

35:21.040 --> 35:22.640
She's still having bronchospasms.

35:22.640 --> 35:24.200
Aspiration can lead to pneumonia.

35:24.200 --> 35:27.320
Depending on how much chocolate
she inhaled. I'm gonna admit her

35:27.320 --> 35:29.680
to ICU so we can watch her
closely for respiratory failure.

35:29.680 --> 35:33.680
All right.
It's all right.

35:36.320 --> 35:38.200
            Thank you.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.840
Call your mother every now and then.

35:40.840 --> 35:42.800
      I call her once a week!

35:42.800 --> 35:46.800
      I call her once a week!
Go crazy - phone her twice.

35:47.440 --> 35:48.800
Your sheet.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.680
  No, no, no. Keep it, you know?

35:50.680 --> 35:53.160
I was going to.

35:53.160 --> 35:57.040
Elliot, get a haircut.
      You're a mess!

35:57.040 --> 35:58.280
          Thanks a lot(!)

35:58.280 --> 36:01.040
Grooming is most important.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.760
If I had a matted Airdale...

36:02.760 --> 36:06.160
If I had a matted Airdale...
       Dad...I'm not a dog.

36:06.160 --> 36:10.160
Sit!

36:18.440 --> 36:20.840
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

36:20.840 --> 36:23.120
Collie needed help.

36:23.120 --> 36:25.480
       You know, it's funny,

36:25.480 --> 36:29.480
I never really thought of a
veterinarian as being a real doctor.

36:29.800 --> 36:33.480
You know, worm a few Bowsers,
kill some fleas on a cat...

36:33.480 --> 36:37.480
When I saw you inside with Jinx,
you were so loving and tender.

36:37.840 --> 36:39.760
Better than I am
with my own patients.

36:39.760 --> 36:42.960
Of course - I been at it longer.

36:42.960 --> 36:46.160
Elliot, whatever kind of animal

36:46.160 --> 36:50.160
we doctors treat,
each needs our devotion.

36:50.400 --> 36:54.400
I became a vet because people
 are a pain in the hindquarters.

36:54.880 --> 36:58.880
You can't communicate with them,
they have no loyalty,

36:59.720 --> 37:03.720
but you - you care a damn
about the stupid human race.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.120
So, OK,

37:06.120 --> 37:10.120
give it all you got!

37:11.800 --> 37:15.800
Come home for the holidays.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.320
           Dr Westphall.

37:21.320 --> 37:22.480
           Dr Westphall.
Hello, Jack.

37:22.480 --> 37:25.040
There's all kinds of rumours going
round about selling the hospital.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.560
Well, that decision's
being made right now.

37:26.560 --> 37:29.360
I can't tell you what's going
to happen. Oh, Jack, listen.

37:29.360 --> 37:32.400
I just got a phone call from
the state parole board.

37:32.400 --> 37:36.400
They know I sent you up
there to Newcastle Prison
   for your community service.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.520
Er...Nick Motes is up  for
   a parole hearing in a week.

37:39.520 --> 37:43.520
They'd like to know if you'd go
up there and testify about what
happened during the riot.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.080
No-one's saying you have to go.

37:46.080 --> 37:47.080
             I'll go.

37:47.080 --> 37:48.160
             I'll go.
They'll ask a lot of questions.

37:48.160 --> 37:50.080
       I'll tell everything.

37:50.080 --> 37:52.160
Sure you wanna go
through with all that?

37:52.160 --> 37:54.480
To keep Nick Motes behind bars, yeah.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.440
Yeah. Well, from what I know,
  we'd all be better off.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.160
     Maybe it's for his sake.

37:59.160 --> 38:03.160
 If Motes gets out, I'll kill him.

38:07.760 --> 38:11.760
You can't tell me ER's the only
reason St Eligius is going down
the pipes.

38:12.360 --> 38:15.320
No. But it is an area where
 we can nip expenses in the bud.

38:15.320 --> 38:16.880
    By refusing to help people?

38:16.880 --> 38:19.640
    By refusing to help people?
By choosing who is more
deserving of our services.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.240
          What services?

38:21.240 --> 38:25.040
Stacks of forms to fill out,
endless waits, mix-ups in the lab...

38:25.040 --> 38:29.040
You know, I've begged Maintenance
for a week to come up here and repair
the short in this lamp. Forget it.

38:30.440 --> 38:34.000
If you ask me, we do too
little for people, not too much.

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
 Will you switch this on, please?

38:41.160 --> 38:43.040
      Life in the inner city.

38:43.040 --> 38:47.040
We don't get the convenient patients
with the convenient
insurance policies.

38:47.320 --> 38:51.000
All these people are knuckle-balls.
If we stat making judgment calls,
we're gonna end up making errors.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.880
I know it will be difficult,
but you must become more selective.

38:54.880 --> 38:56.000
               How?

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
Here's a list of regulations we
expect our ER doctors to follow.

39:00.800 --> 39:04.800
No non-life-threatening ailments,
no appointments
to check hypertension

39:05.360 --> 39:09.360
and not clogging up the system
with repeaters.
This is not a free clinic.

39:10.120 --> 39:13.240
Yeah, I treat people that
need more than just medicine.

39:13.240 --> 39:16.000
I'm the one friendly face some
of these bums see,

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
the only one that cares,
and this hospital is their
last safe place. Now what?

39:22.720 --> 39:26.720
You stole my wallet, punk!
    Come on! Come on!

39:28.080 --> 39:30.960
   I'll make you into mincemeat.

39:30.960 --> 39:34.960
I'll cut you in the throat.

39:36.280 --> 39:40.280
That's the last time
you're picking my pockets, sucker!

39:45.640 --> 39:49.640
        Are you sleepy?  No.

39:50.680 --> 39:54.680
About moving in - there's
something I have to tell you.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
  I already know you hog the bed!

40:02.440 --> 40:06.440
I've been afraid
of moving our relationship ahead.

40:07.720 --> 40:11.720
I figured if we stayed like we were,
I wouldn't have to say anything,

40:12.160 --> 40:16.160
but people deserve to know
    the truth, regardless...

40:16.520 --> 40:17.600
             Of what?

40:17.600 --> 40:21.120
I don't want anything too permanent,

40:21.120 --> 40:25.120
because I don't know
      how permanent I'll be.

40:25.480 --> 40:27.160
    What are you talking about?

40:27.160 --> 40:31.040
    What are you talking about?
Leaving medicine.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.960
Leaving Boston.
I don't know - just leaving.

40:33.960 --> 40:36.480
   Come on, you don't mean that.

40:36.480 --> 40:40.480
I don't know.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.920
           You serious?

40:45.920 --> 40:49.920
Yeah.

40:51.680 --> 40:55.680
            Terrific(!)

40:59.480 --> 41:03.480
TANNOY: Suzie Venture, paediatrics.
Suzie Venture, paediatrics.

41:04.240 --> 41:06.200
There's some blood in your urine.

41:06.200 --> 41:08.200
It's probably a kidney infection.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.840
     It worries me, Dr Fiscus.

41:09.840 --> 41:11.400
I know.

41:11.400 --> 41:14.960
Look, I'll give you a
prescription for antibiotics.

41:14.960 --> 41:15.920
  That's all you're going to do?

41:15.920 --> 41:19.920
  That's all you're going to do?
What can I tell ya?

41:21.400 --> 41:25.400
Come back when you're sicker!

41:29.040 --> 41:31.600
Elliot, you look depressed.
Guess you heard.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.640
        Heard? I was there!

41:33.640 --> 41:35.640
You were?  Sure.

41:35.640 --> 41:38.040
You know, I had never been as
honest with my father as that.

41:38.040 --> 41:40.840
    I mean, I really opened up.

41:40.840 --> 41:43.880
I reached out to hug him and...
he turned away.

41:43.880 --> 41:47.880
Elliot, I was talking about Marcy
Heisenburg. She's in ICU.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.600
              What?!

41:50.600 --> 41:54.600
            I gotta go!

41:57.320 --> 42:00.520
Willie, welcome back.
Heard you were coming down.

42:00.520 --> 42:02.720
 I'm gonna find that guy, I swear!

42:02.720 --> 42:03.880
Sit up.

42:03.880 --> 42:05.160
Sit up.
      Take it easy! I'm hurt!

42:05.160 --> 42:08.280
You know, this hospital
is going down the tubes.

42:08.280 --> 42:10.520
I can't help patients who are
suffering innocently

42:10.520 --> 42:13.560
and I gotta treat someone like
you who gets himself hurt and
  doesn't give a damn!

42:13.560 --> 42:16.400
  Put it on hold and patch me up!

42:16.400 --> 42:20.400
You just missed nicking
your bowel by that much,
    I gotta get a suture tray.

42:42.600 --> 42:46.600
KNOCK AT DOOR
         Yeah, come in.

42:47.080 --> 42:48.800
Daniel, I thought you'd gone home.

42:48.800 --> 42:52.200
On the phone with Ned
at the Mayor's office.

42:52.200 --> 42:54.840
The Mayor had a look
at our report on the ER?

42:54.840 --> 42:57.480
   Finished it a short time ago.

42:57.480 --> 43:00.640
Found it thorough, intelligent
and not the least bit persuasive.

43:00.640 --> 43:03.320
They're gonna sell.

43:03.320 --> 43:07.320
They'll start looking for
prospective buyers ASAP.

43:09.480 --> 43:13.480
How do we proceed from here, then?

43:15.160 --> 43:17.120
             Normally.

43:17.120 --> 43:21.120
I'm at the end of my career anyway.
I'll go down with the ship.

43:23.840 --> 43:27.840
I suggest you start
looking for another job.

43:29.400 --> 43:33.400
         Good night, Don.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.160
        Is Marcy all right?

43:44.160 --> 43:45.440
She's resting.

43:45.440 --> 43:47.960
       How did this happen?

43:47.960 --> 43:51.960
A long time ago. I almost
    didn't go to that party.

43:54.800 --> 43:58.280
1965 was a wonderful time!

43:58.280 --> 44:00.760
The Beatles, Stones,

44:00.760 --> 44:04.760
mods and rockers, Carnaby Street,
paisley, Nehru jackets, Twiggy!

44:07.760 --> 44:10.640
So much exuberance! So much energy!

44:10.640 --> 44:14.280
Youth!

44:14.280 --> 44:17.240
I met Edgar Eisenberg at a party.

44:17.240 --> 44:20.080
We danced the latest craze.

44:20.080 --> 44:24.080
He was handsome, American -
I liked the way he said his A's.

44:24.480 --> 44:28.360
I thought it would be an adventure
to follow him across the water.

44:28.360 --> 44:31.120
          Marcy's father?

44:31.120 --> 44:33.800
One dance.

44:33.800 --> 44:37.800
A few minutes on a night in a
week of a month of a swirling,
vibrant year.

44:39.520 --> 44:43.520
A moment that's become a lifetime.

44:44.320 --> 44:48.320
This isn't the life I wanted.

44:49.440 --> 44:53.440
Um, I'm gonna go in
and say hi to Marcy, OK?

44:53.560 --> 44:57.560
Yes.

45:24.080 --> 45:28.080
      She told me to get out.

45:35.120 --> 45:38.240
              Helen?

45:38.240 --> 46:20.000
               Hug?
