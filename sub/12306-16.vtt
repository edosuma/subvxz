WEBVTT

00:16.210 --> 00:18.406
[lock chirps]

00:51.180 --> 00:52.147
Oh!
Oh!

00:52.150 --> 00:54.073
S-sorry.
That's ok.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.549
Uh, you're isabel,
right?

00:56.550 --> 00:58.484
Uh, yeah. How do
you know my name?

00:58.490 --> 00:59.742
Do you live
in the building?

00:59.760 --> 01:02.149
I'm a friend
of oscar's.

01:02.160 --> 01:05.152
He asked me
to talk to you.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.049
I'm sorry.
It's late.

01:07.060 --> 01:08.095
Just hear me out.

01:08.100 --> 01:09.090
Tell oscar to
leave me alone.

01:09.100 --> 01:12.024
He misses you. You
won't call him back.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.168
So he sends
a messenger?

01:13.170 --> 01:14.262
I don't want anything
to do with him.

01:14.270 --> 01:16.238
Just--just tell him
to stop stalking me.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.833
It cares
about you, izzie.

01:17.840 --> 01:22.209
You need to leave
before I call the police.

01:22.210 --> 01:25.180
Oh. Hang on. Let me.

01:30.750 --> 01:35.688
You need to give oscar
another chance.

01:35.690 --> 01:38.751
Call him, isabel.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.080
Unh!

01:40.100 --> 01:41.124
[groaning]

01:41.130 --> 01:43.428
Help! Somebody,
help me!

01:43.430 --> 01:46.525
Please! Let me in,
let me in!

01:46.540 --> 01:48.292
Err!

01:51.610 --> 01:53.237
Please!

01:53.240 --> 01:55.971
Please!
Somebody help me!

01:55.980 --> 01:57.277
Somebody!

01:57.280 --> 02:01.217
Lucy! Lucy, let me in!
Let me in, please!

02:01.220 --> 02:03.109
Lucy, help!

02:03.120 --> 02:04.986
Aah!

02:04.990 --> 02:06.788
Call the police!

02:27.240 --> 02:29.004
Ohh.

02:47.700 --> 02:48.428
Hey.

02:48.430 --> 02:50.592
Hey. How did
you sleep?

02:50.600 --> 02:52.864
Good. I'm gonna
make some coffee.

02:52.870 --> 02:56.431
Uh, I have to--
I got to roll.

02:56.440 --> 02:57.259
Ok.

02:57.270 --> 02:59.432
[alarm beeping]

03:01.310 --> 03:02.800
Thanks for staying.

03:02.810 --> 03:04.744
You're welcome.

03:05.850 --> 03:09.172
Sorry. See you
at the office.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.215
Ok.

03:12.190 --> 03:14.750
[knock on door]

03:18.160 --> 03:19.184
Jack.
Morning.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.486
What are you
doing here?

03:20.500 --> 03:23.151
What do you mean you're
taking him to school?

03:23.170 --> 03:24.569
You didn't know.

03:24.570 --> 03:25.662
No, I didn't know.

03:25.670 --> 03:27.297
He called me and said
he needed a ride.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.335
Tim's mother is
picking him up.

03:28.340 --> 03:29.796
No. She can't
this morning.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.130
You need to tell
me this stuff.

03:31.140 --> 03:33.563
I thought ethan would. No.
If I don't call you, it's not--

03:33.580 --> 03:35.139
Hi, dad.
Hey, buddy.

03:35.140 --> 03:37.199
Donlt Ilbll__
don't "bye, mom," me.

03:37.210 --> 03:39.907
Ok? You tell me if you
want dad to pick you up, ok?

03:39.920 --> 03:42.241
Ok. Sorry.

03:42.250 --> 03:43.240
Ok.

03:43.250 --> 03:46.311
We're gonna finish
this later.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.958
Bye.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.379
Ben: Intel wants you
to look these photos over.

03:51.390 --> 03:53.484
I couldn't identify
either perry or ray,

03:53.500 --> 03:54.899
But I thought you
should take a look.

03:54.900 --> 03:56.095
I spoke to
perry's father.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.192
He's made no
contact at all.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.498
In fact, his father hired
a private investigator

03:59.500 --> 04:02.993
Did you get a name? We
should monitor their moves.

04:03.010 --> 04:06.105
- Isabel martin's
in the conference room.

04:06.110 --> 04:08.431
Ok. I'll be right there,
and you're right.

04:08.440 --> 04:11.205
None of these
are ray or perry.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.269
Janice, you want to
sit in?

04:13.280 --> 04:16.341
I, uh, got these
for you.

04:16.350 --> 04:17.339
What is it?

04:17.350 --> 04:21.911
Brazilian nuts.
I ate all yours.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.684
Oh.

04:26.760 --> 04:27.625
What?

04:27.630 --> 04:29.849
Nothing.
Nada.

04:35.270 --> 04:38.865
So you've never seen
this man before?

04:38.870 --> 04:39.905
No.

04:39.910 --> 04:43.972
By your ex-boyfriend
oscar ramirez to scare you?

04:43.980 --> 04:45.971
Yes. He's got
this weird idea

04:45.980 --> 04:49.371
That he can scare me back
into his arms again or something.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.710
That's insane, right?

04:50.720 --> 04:52.381
Can't you arrest
the guy?

04:52.390 --> 04:53.414
We need
a little more,

04:53.420 --> 04:55.218
And it is insane, but
it's not uncommon.

04:55.220 --> 04:56.779
A lot of people
with obsessive minds

04:56.790 --> 05:00.328
Can concoct extreme
rationale for their behavior.

05:00.330 --> 05:02.253
Has oscar contacted
you directly?

05:02.260 --> 05:05.469
He did, but I had a restraining
order placed against him.

05:05.470 --> 05:08.064
I filed it
at the hollywood station.

05:08.070 --> 05:09.435
They referred me
to you.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.829
And you live
in isabel's building?

05:11.840 --> 05:13.262
Mm-hmm. Downstairs.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.429
I live on
the second floor.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.932
Have you ever seen this
man in the building before?

05:16.950 --> 05:17.940
Never.

05:17.950 --> 05:18.974
Jack: What are you
looking at?

05:18.980 --> 05:20.778
Trying to identify
this man.

05:20.780 --> 05:22.418
Jeans, plaid shirt,
inexpensive.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.741
Puts him at late
30s, blue collar,

05:24.750 --> 05:27.640
Works
with his hands.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.254
So we're
fitting now?

05:30.260 --> 05:31.523
Excuse me?

05:31.530 --> 05:32.452
Brazilian nuts?

05:32.460 --> 05:33.757
What are you
talking about?

05:33.760 --> 05:35.125
We all take turns
at her place.

05:35.130 --> 05:36.154
Do you not eat
her food?

05:36.170 --> 05:37.922
You've been there
a lot more than me.

05:37.930 --> 05:38.795
I'm not flirting.

05:38.800 --> 05:39.995
So you're sucking up
to the boss.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.162
I was replacing
her nuts.

05:42.170 --> 05:44.593
It's one
or the other, jack.

05:44.610 --> 05:46.829
Tell us about
your ex-boyfriend oscar.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.480
We met right after
I moved to |.A.

05:49.480 --> 05:50.606
When was that?

05:50.610 --> 05:51.771
6 months ago.

05:51.780 --> 05:53.703
I'm--I'm from
rochelle, illinois.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.372
I'm an actress,
or I'm studying to be.

05:57.390 --> 06:01.714
We dated some, but he
was into partying and drugs,

06:01.720 --> 06:05.054
And that's not my scene,
so we broke up.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.880
He was a major addict.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.356
So you know oscar.

06:08.360 --> 06:09.350
Well, through isabel.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.849
I've--I've met him
a few times,

06:10.870 --> 06:13.328
But, um, it's good
they broke up.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.990
He was bad news.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.889
This man last night,
did he attack you?

06:16.910 --> 06:18.799
No, but he was
trying to scare me.

06:18.810 --> 06:22.201
Why would oscar think
intimidating you would make you

06:22.210 --> 06:23.200
Go back to him?

06:23.210 --> 06:24.530
He knows
how to play me.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.699
I'm from a small town,

06:25.710 --> 06:29.374
I've never felt comfortable
living in LA. By myself.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.846
He knows that.

06:30.850 --> 06:32.909
I called him
once before.

06:32.920 --> 06:36.914
I thought I heard someone
trying to get into my apartment.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.388
I got scared,
so I called him.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.879
He came over.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.824
Did you have sex?

06:43.830 --> 06:45.423
Just the once,

06:45.430 --> 06:47.865
But breakup sex
never works.

06:47.870 --> 06:49.235
What does that have
to do with anything?

06:49.240 --> 06:50.992
It's not accusatory.
We're just trying

06:51.010 --> 06:53.229
To understand
oscar's obsession.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.277
Did oscar ever
get violent?

06:55.280 --> 06:57.339
He would get
aggressive.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.341
He never flat out
punched me.

06:59.350 --> 07:03.218
Um, he shoved.
He knocked me to the floor.

07:03.220 --> 07:05.939
He was either drunk
or high.

07:05.950 --> 07:08.044
That's when I filed
the restraining order.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.755
And did he stay
away?

07:09.760 --> 07:12.058
He called a few times,

07:12.060 --> 07:13.687
But last night was
the first time

07:13.700 --> 07:14.895
That he sent his...

07:14.900 --> 07:17.699
Goon friend to scare me.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.020
Will you talk to him?

07:19.030 --> 07:21.761
I just want him
to leave me alone.

07:21.770 --> 07:23.932
Of course we will.

07:38.890 --> 07:41.587
So how long you been
watching michelle?

07:41.590 --> 07:42.910
A few months now.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.955
She's a very
routine girl.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.758
She shops
at the same store,

07:46.760 --> 07:48.956
She does yoga
3 times a week.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.997
Who's she
closest to?

07:51.000 --> 07:54.265
Her best friend.

07:54.270 --> 07:55.431
Tracy.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.091
Hmm. The one you
hooked up with.

07:58.110 --> 08:01.330
Yes. M.I.A.
Currently.

08:01.340 --> 08:04.640
She's hiding
from me.

08:04.650 --> 08:05.503
Who else?

08:05.510 --> 08:07.399
Uh, her co-workers.

08:07.420 --> 08:10.117
There's detective
janice lawrence,

08:10.120 --> 08:11.918
The one who
arrested me.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.240
She's pretty.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.013
I'm not a fan.

08:16.020 --> 08:16.919
This is ben caldwell.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.581
He's more
of a junior detective.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.989
Deputy district attorney
amanda taylor

08:22.000 --> 08:23.490
Handled my arraignment,

08:23.500 --> 08:25.969
And detective
jack larsen.

08:25.970 --> 08:28.689
Yeah. He was
at the crime scene, too.

08:28.700 --> 08:29.997
I mean, they all were.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.933
From what I've put
together, he's new,

08:31.940 --> 08:33.135
He's from new york,

08:33.140 --> 08:36.474
The deputy d.A.'s ex--
I don't know--something.

08:36.480 --> 08:41.008
And now detective jack
is sleeping with michelle.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.772
No.

08:42.780 --> 08:44.646
Beth's not sleeping
with anyone.

08:44.650 --> 08:47.017
She doesn't date. She
doesn't have many friends.

08:47.020 --> 08:50.854
This--these people--
they're--they're the closest thing

08:50.860 --> 08:52.624
She has to a family.

08:52.630 --> 08:54.621
So...

08:54.630 --> 08:56.849
Who do we
target first?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.622
I say janice.

08:58.630 --> 09:00.997
I don't like her.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.490
The woman.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.662
That will evoke
more sympathy,

09:04.670 --> 09:07.560
Create a bigger splash.

09:14.850 --> 09:18.741
This guy,
he needs to go.

09:18.750 --> 09:21.082
What exactly are we
gonna do?

09:21.090 --> 09:22.819
We need to remove
all of them

09:22.820 --> 09:25.050
So we can isolate her.

09:25.060 --> 09:28.997
There will be no one
to turn to but us.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.220
Remove, like, how?

09:32.230 --> 09:35.165
Oh. We scare them,
we scare michelle.

09:35.170 --> 09:37.696
We target them,
she'll push them away

09:37.710 --> 09:40.168
Because she won't
want them to get hurt.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.535
That's how
she operates.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.736
How do we scare them?

09:48.250 --> 09:50.218
All sorts of fun ways.

09:50.220 --> 09:53.588
I'm just not sure
where to begin.

09:58.430 --> 10:00.228
Am I under arrest?

10:00.230 --> 10:01.220
Jack: Not yet.

10:01.230 --> 10:02.129
Then why am I here?

10:02.130 --> 10:03.291
Just want to
talk to you.

10:03.300 --> 10:04.552
) This is
an interrogation room.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.197
There's
a two-way mirror.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.929
It's to
intimidate you.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.090
Is it working?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.032
What'd I do?

10:11.040 --> 10:13.236
We know you've been
harassing isabel.

10:13.240 --> 10:16.631
Ben: She said you've been
showing up to her apartment,

10:16.650 --> 10:19.073
Look. Ok. I've done
all those things

10:19.080 --> 10:20.104
Because I love her,

10:20.120 --> 10:21.144
Not to harass her.

10:21.150 --> 10:23.118
So you admit you sent
someone to her apartment

10:23.120 --> 10:25.646
To talk to her, huh?

10:28.990 --> 10:31.118
I don't know this guy. I mean,
I didn't send him anywhere.

10:31.130 --> 10:34.259
Good, because there's a
restraining order against you.

10:34.260 --> 10:36.820
And stalking by
proxy is still stalking.

10:36.830 --> 10:37.752
I'm not an idiot,

10:37.770 --> 10:39.329
But I don't know
who this is.

10:39.330 --> 10:42.960
Isabel tells us
you have a drug problem.

10:46.110 --> 10:48.101
Not anymore. I'm sober.

10:48.110 --> 10:49.180
How long?

10:49.180 --> 10:50.329
3 months.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.239
My dad was a drunk.

10:52.250 --> 10:56.448
That first year, he was
one mean son of a bitch.

10:56.450 --> 10:59.147
All those reasons we
drink come to the surface.

10:59.150 --> 11:02.085
Makes you angry.

11:02.090 --> 11:04.252
Well, that's not
my experience.

11:04.260 --> 11:05.330
It sounds specific
to your dad.

11:05.330 --> 11:06.855
Maybe you should go talk
to somebody

11:06.860 --> 11:08.157
About those
residual feelings.

11:08.160 --> 11:12.097
It was a lie. I was
just intimidating you.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.170
Are they getting
anywhere?

11:13.170 --> 11:14.592
They're trying to
scare him into

11:14.600 --> 11:15.499
Staying away
from isabel.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.036
Jack: You know what
we found out?

11:17.040 --> 11:18.269
Isabel is
a trust fund kid.

11:18.270 --> 11:21.501
Her parents died and left
her 5 million bucks.

11:21.510 --> 11:22.204
She's loaded.

11:22.210 --> 11:23.371
Your point?
You're not.

11:23.380 --> 11:25.348
You don't have
any money or a job.

11:25.350 --> 11:26.545
You lost
your meal ticket.

11:26.550 --> 11:28.177
I've never taken
a dime of izzie's money!

11:28.180 --> 11:29.716
That's not what
she said.

11:29.720 --> 11:30.619
That's a lie!

11:30.620 --> 11:32.213
You're right. It is.
Made it up,

11:32.220 --> 11:34.211
But, boy, did you
get mad.

11:34.220 --> 11:36.757
You get angry a lot?

11:39.160 --> 11:40.719
Why are you guys
doing this?

11:40.730 --> 11:42.289
We're
intimidating you.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.689
Do you get it? You need
to stay away from isabel,

11:44.700 --> 11:46.566
Tell your friends to
stay away from her.

11:46.570 --> 11:48.561
We can make trouble
for you,

11:48.570 --> 11:51.130
And by make trouble,
we mean

11:51.140 --> 11:53.734
Make it up.

11:53.740 --> 11:56.300
You understand?

11:56.310 --> 11:58.335
Stay away from isabel.

11:58.350 --> 12:01.308
Got it?

12:01.320 --> 12:02.742
Yeah, I got it.

12:02.750 --> 12:06.584
Good. You're free
to go.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.182
Let's see
if that works.

12:13.200 --> 12:16.158
[music playing]

12:16.160 --> 12:18.299
Thank you.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.929
Ohh!

12:27.070 --> 12:28.834
Hey!

12:43.220 --> 12:45.279
Isabel.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.625
We're coming for you.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.323
What did you say?

13:03.080 --> 13:04.809
[car lock chirps]

13:10.250 --> 13:12.014
[car starts]

13:18.430 --> 13:20.819
No.

13:20.830 --> 13:22.650
[honking horn]

13:22.660 --> 13:26.267
No. Get away from me!
Leave me alone!

13:26.270 --> 13:29.729
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!

13:29.740 --> 13:31.060
Oh, god! Get away!

13:31.070 --> 13:33.732
[tires squeal]

13:41.850 --> 13:42.772
They surrounded
the car,

13:42.780 --> 13:44.748
And I was so scared,

13:44.750 --> 13:45.945
And--and I saw
the guy,

13:45.950 --> 13:47.748
The same one
from my building.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.479
Oscar may be trying to
assert his power over you

13:50.490 --> 13:52.754
By using others
to terrorize you.

13:52.760 --> 13:54.922
But why can't he
take the hint?

13:54.930 --> 13:58.195
We are never going
to get back together.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.623
Did you recognize
anyone in the crowd?

14:00.640 --> 14:03.837
Could any of them
have been oscar's friends?

14:03.840 --> 14:07.003
I feel like I'm
losing my mind.

14:07.010 --> 14:12.779
This restraining order was
supposed to stop all of this.

14:12.780 --> 14:13.850
I know.

14:13.850 --> 14:16.876
This is hard because
it's complicated,

14:16.890 --> 14:22.181
But we have no way of
connecting oscar to this.

14:22.190 --> 14:25.820
Could it be
anyone else?

14:25.830 --> 14:27.924
No one I know.

14:29.860 --> 14:32.659
It has to be oscar.

14:32.670 --> 14:37.039
Then we'll prove it,
I promise.

14:37.970 --> 14:39.859
Jack: When was the last time
you saw a case of group stalking?

14:39.880 --> 14:42.838
We've only had two in the 4
years I've been working here.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.535
It's rare. Less than 1%

14:44.550 --> 14:46.507
Of all documented
stalking cases nationwide.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.740
Seems like a strange way
to get someone's attention.

14:48.750 --> 14:51.412
Yeah. This particular
tactic is called street theater.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.582
It's commonly used
in gangs and other groups

14:53.590 --> 14:55.251
To terrorize their victims
out in the open.

14:55.260 --> 14:57.479
The ones who act out the
violence are the foot soldiers,

14:57.490 --> 14:59.527
Usually taking orders
from an authority figure.

14:59.530 --> 15:02.898
Are you describing cult
activity, like heaven's gate?

15:02.900 --> 15:05.665
Southern california has
historically been a mecca

15:05.670 --> 15:07.559
<i>For alternative
spiritual movements.</i>

15:07.570 --> 15:09.766
So I did a trail
of the traffic cameras.

15:09.770 --> 15:11.397
Our attacker walked
for 5 blocks,

15:11.410 --> 15:13.037
Then got
into a black car.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.530
I ran the license plate.

15:14.540 --> 15:15.610
Clark jennings
is the name.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.009
His address is
a mailbox center.

15:17.010 --> 15:18.000
There's a bolo out.

15:18.010 --> 15:19.375
Amanda: Hey. I got
the warrant issued.

15:19.380 --> 15:21.849
<i>You can do a full
background on dark jennings.</i>

15:21.850 --> 15:23.511
Let's look into
financials, tax records,

15:23.520 --> 15:25.010
See what we
can find.

15:25.020 --> 15:26.943
Jack.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.358
I'm sorry if I was
cranky yesterday.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.556
No. I'm the one
who's sorry.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.949
I'll call you next time
he contacts me.

15:34.960 --> 15:38.225
This is--this is
all new for me.

15:38.230 --> 15:41.564
Yeah, me, too.

15:41.570 --> 15:43.231
So we're good?

15:43.240 --> 15:45.299
Yeah, we're good.

15:45.310 --> 15:47.608
Because, uh, he, um--

15:47.610 --> 15:50.204
He wants to sleep
at my place tonight.

15:50.210 --> 15:53.373
What should I say?

15:53.380 --> 15:54.870
Text me
when you're done.

15:54.880 --> 15:57.372
I'll drop him off.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.210
Ok.

16:01.960 --> 16:05.419
Ben: Jennings' financial
statements for the past two years.

16:05.430 --> 16:06.659
The guy's a millionaire.

16:06.660 --> 16:09.595
Not yet. He's set
to inherit 2.5 million

16:09.600 --> 16:10.795
Once his parents
pass away.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.564
In the meantime,
looks like he's got

16:12.570 --> 16:14.561
A nice trust fund
keeping him afloat.

16:14.570 --> 16:16.129
Only he's been
handing off that money

16:16.140 --> 16:17.790
To a company called
tcf, lic.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.438
Clark gave them
$25,000 last year alone.

16:20.440 --> 16:25.173
No info, but there's
an address in chatsworth.

16:25.180 --> 16:27.148
Check it out?

16:40.960 --> 16:42.098
Nice house.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.660
Does clark jennings
live here alone?

16:44.670 --> 16:46.422
No idea.

16:46.430 --> 16:49.263
Hey. You like
Korean barbeque?

16:49.270 --> 16:50.294
Where did that
come from?

16:50.310 --> 16:51.960
There's that place on
sunset near your house.

16:51.970 --> 16:55.167
Just wondering if you
ever checked it out.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.877
I have. It's good.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.508
We should order
from there next time.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.113
You planning dinner?

17:02.120 --> 17:04.680
You're the one
with the empty fridge.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.839
Ha ha ha!

17:08.119 --> 17:10.281
[rings doorbell]

17:16.130 --> 17:18.121
No answer.

17:20.630 --> 17:23.291
Looks like
someone's home.

17:24.869 --> 17:27.259
The truck's still warm.

17:33.350 --> 17:36.115
Big house
for one person.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.947
Woman: No!

18:06.950 --> 18:07.746
No!

18:07.750 --> 18:09.377
[people chanting]

18:09.380 --> 18:11.371
[woman cries]

18:11.390 --> 18:13.882
No!

18:13.890 --> 18:18.111
No! No!

18:18.130 --> 18:20.155
Aah!

18:40.610 --> 18:41.941
What are you doing here?

18:41.950 --> 18:43.247
This is private property.

18:43.250 --> 18:44.911
We heard screams.
What's going on here?

18:44.920 --> 18:47.139
None of your business.
You're trespassing.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.958
Lapd. We're looking
for the owner.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.156
Man: I believe
that would be me.

18:51.160 --> 18:54.221
Welcome to our home.
Sorry for the confusion.

18:54.230 --> 18:56.153
It was meditation hour.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.128
Screaming is a release.

18:58.130 --> 19:00.064
It--it can help
the body relax.

19:00.070 --> 19:02.960
I'm abraham.
How can I help you?

19:02.970 --> 19:04.734
Is clark jennings here?

19:04.740 --> 19:06.765
I haven't seen clark
in a few weeks.

19:06.770 --> 19:09.137
He took some time
to himself.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.130
How well do you
know him?

19:10.150 --> 19:13.472
He's relatively new
to our family.

19:13.480 --> 19:18.077
We're investigating an
incident of group stalking.

19:18.090 --> 19:19.239
Heh. Don't look here.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.287
We're--we're not violent.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.849
Very peaceful.
We do the whole

19:22.860 --> 19:25.249
Love and sex,
no war philosophy.

19:25.260 --> 19:26.182
Do all these
people live here?

19:26.190 --> 19:28.079
Yes. Come on.
I'll show you around.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.660
We're a community
of like-minded souls.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.298
We call it
the celestial fellowship.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.768
I'm not familiar
with your sect.

19:34.770 --> 19:36.295
Is everyone here
over 217

19:36.300 --> 19:38.940
Yes. We're also
nonprofit status.

19:38.940 --> 19:40.169
You can review
our tax records

19:40.180 --> 19:41.705
At the county office
if you like.

19:41.710 --> 19:42.836
What goes on
in here?

19:42.840 --> 19:44.137
Day trading.
As individuals,

19:44.150 --> 19:45.174
We have to
make money.

19:45.180 --> 19:47.103
This isn't some hippie
commune, detective.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.043
We embrace the world
we live in.

19:49.050 --> 19:50.848
And what is
your doctrine?

19:50.850 --> 19:52.181
It's a blend
of new age mysticism

19:52.190 --> 19:55.182
And astronomy combined
with hard reality.

19:55.190 --> 19:56.658
We seek what
everyone does--

19:56.660 --> 19:59.049
Happiness, love,
understanding.

19:59.060 --> 20:00.858
<i>You know a man named
Oscar ramirez?</i>

20:00.860 --> 20:02.453
Doesn't ring
a bell, no.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.690
What about
isabel martin?

20:04.700 --> 20:06.498
Isabel?

20:06.500 --> 20:08.229
Nope.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.696
If there's
nothing else,

20:09.700 --> 20:12.203
If you find clark,
send him our way.

20:12.210 --> 20:15.032
I'd love to help him
right his wrongs.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.405
You mind if we
look around?

20:16.410 --> 20:18.629
You're friends now.
You have full access.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.243
I'd love to know more
about your community.

20:20.250 --> 20:24.312
Well...Skye will be
very happy

20:24.320 --> 20:26.084
To show you
both around.

20:26.090 --> 20:29.151
Nice to meet you.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.958
Come.

20:32.060 --> 20:34.154
Jack: Quite
a piece of property.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.559
Our home rests
on an acre.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.392
How many people
live here?

20:37.400 --> 20:39.198
Skye: There are
32 members.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.020
You make all this
day trading?

20:41.040 --> 20:44.237
That along with a mix
of personal donations.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.039
This is our
meditation grove.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.338
Tell me about
your beliefs.

20:49.340 --> 20:52.173
Right, but do you
worship a lunar deity like

20:52.180 --> 20:55.172
The hindus or the
unification church?

20:55.180 --> 20:56.944
- It's rooted
IN astronomy.

20:56.950 --> 20:59.248
Instead of saints,
we have stars

20:59.250 --> 21:00.888
That represent
who we are.

21:00.890 --> 21:02.756
Are aliens involved?

21:02.760 --> 21:05.889
No. No aliens.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.449
Just our souls.

21:07.460 --> 21:08.882
You know, if you're
interested,

21:08.900 --> 21:11.289
We offer an
introductory session.

21:11.300 --> 21:13.268
How much you
got to pay?

21:13.270 --> 21:15.398
It's free,
detective.

21:15.400 --> 21:19.359
We welcome everyone
if they're willing.

21:19.370 --> 21:20.599
You can't get
a restraining order

21:20.610 --> 21:22.066
Against
an entire cult.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.730
Then we need something
on their leader abraham.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.605
There's no evidence
he's ever been anywhere

21:25.610 --> 21:27.203
Near isabel or oscar.

21:27.220 --> 21:29.211
This is gonna be a very
difficult sell to a judge.

21:29.220 --> 21:31.370
Well, we can't just stand by
and wait to see what happens.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.711
This guy's in a position where
he could be very dangerous.

21:33.720 --> 21:34.812
He's a delusional
narcissist

21:34.820 --> 21:37.118
With a house full
of brainwashed zombies

21:37.130 --> 21:38.279
Willing to do
his bidding.

21:38.290 --> 21:39.655
Look. They know that
you're on to them.

21:39.660 --> 21:41.788
If they're foolish
enough to make a move,

21:41.800 --> 21:42.892
We're gonna
be ready.

21:42.900 --> 21:44.299
In the meantime,
s.I.D. Is lifting the print

21:44.300 --> 21:45.449
We got off
the pamphlet.

21:45.470 --> 21:48.394
What do you want to bet
our cult leader has a record?

21:57.310 --> 21:59.950
You've been gone
forever.

21:59.950 --> 22:02.442
A few hours.

22:02.450 --> 22:03.815
I've been worried.

22:03.820 --> 22:07.313
Where were you?
What were you doing?

22:07.320 --> 22:09.914
You are very nosey.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.524
Heh.

22:20.670 --> 22:25.460
So? What do you think?

22:25.470 --> 22:27.529
It's a gun.

22:27.540 --> 22:29.099
Very good.

22:29.110 --> 22:31.533
I thought we were
just gonna scare them.

22:31.550 --> 22:34.247
Why would you
need a gun?

22:38.290 --> 22:40.349
See?

22:40.360 --> 22:42.510
Aren't you afraid?

22:44.390 --> 22:48.054
A gun is very good
for scaring people.

22:53.400 --> 22:56.665
Well, as long as
that's all we do.

22:56.670 --> 22:58.695
I think...

22:58.710 --> 23:03.739
I think we need to, um,
establish a code of conduct.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.570
A code of conduct?

23:05.580 --> 23:08.572
I don't want to physically
hurt anyone, ray,

23:08.580 --> 23:11.914
I think we should
both agree to that.

23:11.920 --> 23:14.048
We want to scare
beth, isolate her,

23:14.060 --> 23:16.654
Make her feel
vulnerable. Your words.

23:16.660 --> 23:18.754
We don't need to
hurt her or her people.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.057
They're
police detectives.

23:20.060 --> 23:22.791
We could get
in a lot of trouble.

23:23.930 --> 23:26.399
You should see
your face.

23:26.400 --> 23:31.429
You look like you
regret ever meeting me.

23:35.410 --> 23:36.434
It's a money grab.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.534
Abraham knows about
isabel's trust fund,

23:38.550 --> 23:39.574
And he's trying
to recruit her--

23:39.580 --> 23:40.706
Same thing he did
with clark.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.370
So they're lying
about knowing oscar?

23:42.380 --> 23:43.518
Or this could all
be a ruse,

23:43.520 --> 23:44.840
Using oscar to get
her money.

23:44.850 --> 23:46.716
Cults prey on people
like isabel

23:46.720 --> 23:47.744
And her ex-boyfriend.

23:47.760 --> 23:51.116
Manson, jones, koresh,
they all did.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.052
Let's play it out.

23:52.060 --> 23:54.279
Oscar's on drugs,
he's vulnerable,

23:54.300 --> 23:55.426
They recruit him,
sober him up.

23:55.430 --> 23:57.853
Life is great.
He wants his girl back.

23:57.870 --> 24:01.192
They want her money,
so they freak her out.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.929
Small-town girl,
big, scary city.

24:02.940 --> 24:05.398
They're scaring her
into recruitment.

24:05.410 --> 24:09.062
We still don't have anything
to connect oscar to the cult.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.900
He said he went
to rehab. He's in aa.

24:10.910 --> 24:12.207
Then how did the cult
find isabel

24:12.210 --> 24:13.746
If they don't
know oscar?

24:13.750 --> 24:15.570
That's a good question.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.412
It would have to be
somebody close to isabel,

24:17.420 --> 24:19.445
Someone that
she would trust.

24:19.450 --> 24:22.454
What do we know
about her friend lucy?

24:22.460 --> 24:24.485
I'll look into it.

24:27.130 --> 24:29.428
[music playing]

24:29.430 --> 24:30.420
Hey.

24:30.430 --> 24:31.955
This is my friend
isabel.

24:31.970 --> 24:35.292
Oh, yeah. Lucy's
told me all about you.

24:35.300 --> 24:38.235
Uh, you're her
neighbor, the actress

24:38.240 --> 24:39.799
With
the ex-boyfriend.

24:39.810 --> 24:42.609
Yeah. I left out
the bad part.

24:42.610 --> 24:44.430
Please. We all have
ex-boyfriends.

24:44.450 --> 24:47.249
I'm so glad lucy finally
got you over here.

24:47.250 --> 24:48.945
Let's get you
something to drink.

24:48.950 --> 24:51.578
Yeah.
Ok.

24:51.590 --> 24:53.979
Hey.
Hi. Welcome.

24:53.990 --> 24:55.583
Everyone is
SO nice.

24:55.590 --> 24:57.979
I told you.
I know, I know.

24:57.990 --> 24:59.526
I should have
come sooner.

24:59.530 --> 25:00.656
Here you go.

25:00.660 --> 25:01.627
Oh, thanks.

25:01.630 --> 25:03.428
You know, when lucy
was first trying

25:03.430 --> 25:04.852
To get me
to come here,

25:04.870 --> 25:07.191
I thought you guys
were a cult.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.270
[both laughing]

25:08.270 --> 25:09.123
That's funny.

25:09.140 --> 25:11.438
Naw. I mean, we get
a little hippie

25:11.440 --> 25:12.635
With the astronomy stuff,

25:12.640 --> 25:14.961
But that's as nutty
as it gets,

25:14.980 --> 25:17.335
And we even drink.

25:17.840 --> 25:21.504
Well, I'm glad
I'm finally here.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.342
You know, I really
want you to meet abraham.

25:24.350 --> 25:27.513
He's a really big deal
around here.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.716
Sure.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.686
Um...Sorry.

25:32.690 --> 25:35.227
The wine went straight
to my head.

25:35.230 --> 25:38.894
Abraham, this
is isabel.

25:40.230 --> 25:44.189
Wait. I know you.

25:44.210 --> 25:49.705
It's nice to meet
you isabel.

25:49.710 --> 25:51.371
But...

25:51.380 --> 25:54.099
You're not abraham.

25:57.650 --> 25:59.584
I don't feel good.

25:59.590 --> 26:01.240
Ohh! Isabel!

26:01.260 --> 26:03.718
Oh, my god.
Isabell

26:03.720 --> 26:05.586
What's wrong?

26:11.060 --> 26:12.698
Unis went
by lucy's apartment.

26:12.700 --> 26:14.327
She wasn't home.
And isabel?

26:14.340 --> 26:15.899
Isabel's not
answering her cell.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.995
Her facebook page is
filled with new age babble

26:19.010 --> 26:22.674
About star patterns
and celestial energy.

26:22.680 --> 26:25.672
Lucy's been a part
of this all along.

26:25.680 --> 26:28.377
Well, she knew about oscar
and isabel's relationship,

26:28.380 --> 26:29.609
So she could have easily
been the one

26:29.620 --> 26:30.849
Orchestrating the stalking.

26:30.850 --> 26:32.614
That's an elaborate
way to recruit someone.

26:32.620 --> 26:33.382
Not just anyone.

26:33.390 --> 26:35.381
A girl worth
$5 million.

26:35.390 --> 26:36.710
No family
to speak of.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.210
She's naive,
she's vulnerable.

26:38.230 --> 26:39.629
You scare her
and then swoop in

26:39.630 --> 26:41.052
As the answer
to all her problems.

26:41.060 --> 26:42.892
We need to get
inside that house.

26:42.900 --> 26:43.856
Not without a warrant,

26:43.860 --> 26:45.419
And we can't get one
without proof.

26:45.430 --> 26:46.568
This is all conjecture.

26:46.570 --> 26:48.026
Then we need something that
links the cult to isabel,

26:48.040 --> 26:50.634
And let's look beyond
the money for a second.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.199
Why would they want her?

26:52.210 --> 26:54.201
Could be something else.

27:02.480 --> 27:03.811
Is everyone ready?

27:03.820 --> 27:04.969
Just say the word.

27:04.990 --> 27:06.719
Ready for what?

27:06.720 --> 27:07.710
Her initiation.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.552
You didn't have to
drug her.

27:09.560 --> 27:10.618
She came here
willingly.

27:10.630 --> 27:12.382
She wanted to be here!

27:12.390 --> 27:15.223
Skye, give us
a moment.

27:20.270 --> 27:21.169
I don't understand.

27:21.170 --> 27:23.059
You drugged her.
That wasn't the plan.

27:23.070 --> 27:24.936
No. I should have
prepared you for that.

27:24.940 --> 27:26.635
And why did she
recognize you?

27:26.640 --> 27:27.664
Have you met her
before?

27:27.680 --> 27:29.933
Yes. We met
a long time ago.

27:29.940 --> 27:33.774
That's when I knew
isabel was special.

27:33.780 --> 27:35.305
I've always known.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.073
I recognized it when
she was just a child,

27:38.090 --> 27:40.240
But I had to
wait for her

27:40.250 --> 27:42.412
To come to us.

27:42.420 --> 27:43.581
When she moved
to I.A,,

27:43.590 --> 27:44.751
I knew it was
a sign.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.956
She's the highest point
of our constellation,

27:46.960 --> 27:49.600
The one we've been
waiting for.

27:49.600 --> 27:50.692
I'm sorry
about the wine.

27:50.700 --> 27:52.293
I was just worried
she would try to leave

27:52.300 --> 27:54.291
Before we could welcome
her to our family.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.860
We don't force
people to believe.

27:56.870 --> 27:58.929
We help them,
we persuade them.

27:58.940 --> 28:00.465
We don't hurt them.

28:00.470 --> 28:01.369
You drugged her.

28:01.380 --> 28:04.680
I know, I know, but
isabel's different.

28:04.680 --> 28:05.829
She's special.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.147
What about
the police?

28:07.150 --> 28:09.175
Aren't you worried
about the police?

28:09.180 --> 28:10.716
We could get in a lot
of a trouble.

28:10.720 --> 28:14.213
When she wakes up, we'll
explain everything to her.

28:14.220 --> 28:16.450
I promise.

28:16.460 --> 28:19.725
And if she maintains
her free will,

28:19.730 --> 28:22.700
If she wants to leave,
she can?

28:22.700 --> 28:24.520
Yes.

28:24.530 --> 28:28.194
If we can't convince her
that she belongs here,

28:28.200 --> 28:30.794
She's free to go.

28:43.980 --> 28:47.211
I've been waiting
for you, izzie.

28:56.060 --> 28:58.051
Ben: The celestial
fellowship is owned

28:58.070 --> 28:59.822
By an lic out
of the cayman islands.

28:59.830 --> 29:01.662
As far as I can tell,
they're clean.

29:01.670 --> 29:03.593
Jack: Abraham covered
his tracks.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.034
All right.
Cult leaders are

29:05.040 --> 29:07.759
About power
and control, right?

29:07.780 --> 29:08.736
Money and sex.

29:08.740 --> 29:10.674
Yes, but they're
also narcissists

29:10.680 --> 29:11.772
Who drink
their own kool-aid.

29:11.780 --> 29:12.906
Jones believed
his message,

29:12.910 --> 29:14.548
And koresh thought he
was the second coming.

29:14.550 --> 29:18.339
So what is abraham preaching
to control these disciples?

29:18.350 --> 29:20.512
Janice: We got a hit
off the print

29:20.520 --> 29:21.715
From the fellowship
brochure.

29:21.720 --> 29:22.858
Abraham is an alias.

29:22.860 --> 29:25.079
His real name is
robert foster.

29:25.090 --> 29:26.728
The fbi investigated him
in the past

29:26.730 --> 29:27.959
For fraud
and sexual abuse.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.359
No charges were
ever filed.

29:29.360 --> 29:30.395
No, but check it out.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.892
He's originally
from rochelle, illinois.

29:32.900 --> 29:35.699
That's isabel's
hometown.

29:35.700 --> 29:37.429
Could they know
each other?

29:37.440 --> 29:38.293
I'm on it.

29:38.310 --> 29:39.766
Jack: He targeted
isabel.

29:39.770 --> 29:41.738
This isn't
about money.

29:41.740 --> 29:45.608
Ben: I've got something connecting
abraham, aka robert foster,

29:45.610 --> 29:48.250
Their families lived
two blocks from each other.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.617
Robert was
the oldest son.

29:50.620 --> 29:54.215
Wait. He was committed
to a psychiatric facility.

29:54.220 --> 29:57.053
Records are sealed,
which means something bad.

29:57.060 --> 29:58.653
Call the bureau.
Tell them we have

29:58.660 --> 29:59.752
Whereabouts
on foster.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.683
We'll go in
together.

30:05.730 --> 30:08.665
[indistinct chatter]

30:25.920 --> 30:27.410
Move in!
Let's go!

30:27.420 --> 30:29.240
Sweep it!

30:34.830 --> 30:36.491
Jack: No one's down here.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.719
Let's check upstairs.

30:43.940 --> 30:46.932
[woman moaning, crying]

30:57.050 --> 30:59.644
Get a medic
up here!

30:59.650 --> 31:00.446
Lucy?

31:00.450 --> 31:01.781
Lucy, are you ok?

31:01.790 --> 31:03.986
What happened?
Where's isabel?

31:03.990 --> 31:05.480
He took her.

31:05.490 --> 31:06.889
Who took her?

31:06.890 --> 31:09.552
To her initiation.

31:09.560 --> 31:11.050
What kind
of initiation? Where?

31:11.070 --> 31:14.961
He's gonna baptize her to
make her part of the family.

31:14.970 --> 31:15.823
Where is that?

31:15.840 --> 31:18.866
Abraham said that he
wouldn't harm her.

31:18.870 --> 31:19.701
Where?

31:19.710 --> 31:22.463
I'm sorry.
I don't know.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.899
[sobs]

31:28.310 --> 31:29.209
I just spoke to ben.

31:29.220 --> 31:30.346
According to their
tax records,

31:30.350 --> 31:33.547
The celestial fellowship
and a small campground

31:33.550 --> 31:34.881
Near angeles forest.

31:34.890 --> 31:36.210
He just sent this to me.

31:36.220 --> 31:38.257
Lucy called it
a baptism.

31:38.260 --> 31:39.386
It's got to be the forest.

31:39.390 --> 31:41.984
Lakes, streams,
plenty of water.

31:54.870 --> 31:58.033
Abraham: Gather around.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.678
Welcome.

32:00.680 --> 32:03.945
Tonight, my family,

32:03.950 --> 32:07.147
Is a very special night.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.509
Please welcome
our newest member,

32:12.530 --> 32:17.457
The celestial sphere
we've been waiting for.

32:17.460 --> 32:18.950
Robert, what is this?

32:18.970 --> 32:20.893
Please. What are
you doing?

32:20.900 --> 32:22.891
Robert doesn't
exist anymore.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.390
I'm abraham now.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.037
Robert's that guy
down the street

32:26.040 --> 32:27.132
Who you ignored
and rejected,

32:27.140 --> 32:28.960
A man who wasn't
worthy of you,

32:28.980 --> 32:31.369
But I knew that once
I changed

32:31.380 --> 32:34.441
You would
come back to me.

32:35.450 --> 32:38.112
I'm abraham now.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.576
What are you
talking about?

32:39.590 --> 32:42.412
I've become worthy
of your love.

32:42.420 --> 32:43.888
I made myself new

32:43.890 --> 32:47.929
And created this world
for you, for us.

32:47.930 --> 32:50.297
You can love me now.

32:50.300 --> 32:52.894
We can be together.

32:56.940 --> 33:00.160
It's time for you
to be new.

33:06.450 --> 33:08.305
[gasps]

33:17.490 --> 33:20.528
[sirens]

33:43.220 --> 33:44.710
Clear. No one.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.586
We're in.

33:56.830 --> 33:58.059
[gasps]

33:58.070 --> 33:59.458
Please.

33:59.470 --> 34:00.369
[sobbing]

34:00.370 --> 34:04.534
That wasn't so
horrible, was it, zenith?

34:04.540 --> 34:06.508
That's your family name.

34:06.510 --> 34:08.569
You're one of us now.

34:08.580 --> 34:09.706
No!

34:09.710 --> 34:11.474
Yes.

34:13.179 --> 34:14.944
Aah!

34:16.480 --> 34:21.543
You're crazy.
All of you.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.413
Aah!

34:22.420 --> 34:23.409
Man: Police! Lapd!

34:23.420 --> 34:25.855
Hands up, hands up!
Hands up, hands up!

34:25.860 --> 34:28.579
Fbi! Hold it
right there!

34:28.600 --> 34:31.319
[shouting]

34:31.330 --> 34:33.661
There in the blue!

34:34.670 --> 34:37.092
Face down!
Hands behind your back!

34:37.100 --> 34:39.831
You, hands
on your head!

34:42.340 --> 34:44.308
Don't move!

34:47.210 --> 34:50.009
<i>Abraham groans)</i>

34:50.020 --> 34:51.579
Get your hands off me!

34:51.590 --> 34:54.946
You're denying my right
to religious freedom.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.782
Jack: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on.

35:04.100 --> 35:05.898
When I was younger,
his family was

35:05.900 --> 35:08.722
Friends
with my family.

35:08.740 --> 35:11.869
When my parents died,

35:11.870 --> 35:13.099
He was nice.

35:13.110 --> 35:15.431
He wanted to be
more than friends,

35:15.440 --> 35:18.307
But he was older,

35:18.310 --> 35:20.108
And it--it got
a little weird,

35:20.110 --> 35:25.378
And I told his mom, and she
told him to leave me alone,

35:25.390 --> 35:28.314
And he did.

35:28.320 --> 35:30.414
How old were you?

35:30.420 --> 35:31.717
I was just a kid.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.653
I heard he had
some problems,

35:33.660 --> 35:35.719
And he was
sent away.

35:35.730 --> 35:39.121
I never heard anything
about it again.

35:40.630 --> 35:43.634
That's because
he was committed.

35:46.170 --> 35:48.662
He suffers
from erotomania.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.479
They create worlds
in their head,

35:51.480 --> 35:54.074
Relationships
that don't exist.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.479
When he found out
you were in |.A.,

35:55.480 --> 35:59.644
He pursued you,
and he used his people

35:59.650 --> 36:02.517
To trap you.

36:05.020 --> 36:06.784
Lucy was my friend.

36:06.790 --> 36:10.328
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

36:20.140 --> 36:22.359
Can we call anyone
for you,

36:22.380 --> 36:25.475
A family member?

36:25.480 --> 36:27.574
There's nobody.

36:29.050 --> 36:31.439
It's just me.

36:37.560 --> 36:40.655
Janice: Abraham is
in fbi custody.

36:40.660 --> 36:41.821
Formal charges
will be filed tomorrow.

36:41.830 --> 36:43.320
What about the rest
of the cult members?

36:43.330 --> 36:44.889
Fbi will bring in
exit counselors

36:44.900 --> 36:47.665
To help reverse whatever
hold abraham had over them.

36:47.670 --> 36:49.889
There's just no shortage
of crazy in this town.

36:49.900 --> 36:50.992
Cults freak me out.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.468
And there's
too many of them.

36:52.470 --> 36:54.734
I got sucked
into one once.

36:54.740 --> 36:56.469
I was young,
angry at the world.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.733
Took a few classes,
I was audited.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.548
I almost drank
the kool-aid.

37:00.550 --> 37:01.676
What happened?

37:01.680 --> 37:03.910
Turns out
I like bourbon.

37:03.920 --> 37:05.513
Anyone want a drink?

37:05.520 --> 37:06.715
I'm buying.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.040
Nice segue,
but I can't.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.585
Uh, I got plans.

37:09.590 --> 37:10.580
Drink one for me?

37:10.590 --> 37:11.910
Sure. Beth.

37:11.930 --> 37:14.319
Enchiladas
and margaritas?

37:14.330 --> 37:15.650
Not tonight.

37:15.660 --> 37:17.890
Will you be ok?

37:22.200 --> 37:23.895
Are they hooking up?

37:23.900 --> 37:24.833
Not yet.

37:24.840 --> 37:25.762
How do you know?

37:25.770 --> 37:28.205
Please. Soon,
but not yet.

37:28.210 --> 37:30.872
This ray thing
needs to pass first.

37:30.880 --> 37:33.178
She'll be read
for a future.

37:33.180 --> 37:35.569
Manana.
See you.

37:35.580 --> 37:38.777
[music playing]

37:53.600 --> 37:56.160
[knock on door]

37:59.270 --> 38:00.806
Hey!

38:00.810 --> 38:02.539
Pizza's on the way.

38:02.540 --> 38:03.610
Awesome!

38:03.610 --> 38:05.704
Oh, uh,
I brought games.

38:05.710 --> 38:06.745
Great. Yeah, yeah.
Listen.

38:06.750 --> 38:09.105
Uh, got the controllers
all set up, ready to go.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.714
Why is the tv
on the floor?

38:11.720 --> 38:14.417
Um, it's cool.

38:14.420 --> 38:15.239
Yeah.

38:15.260 --> 38:17.752
Hold on, little man. Come here.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.455
I love you.

38:19.460 --> 38:21.258
See you
tomorrow, ok?

38:21.260 --> 38:23.228
I love you, too.

38:23.230 --> 38:25.050
Have fun.

38:25.070 --> 38:27.767
Hey. You want to
stay for one?

38:27.770 --> 38:32.298
Oh, no. I want a bubble
bath and a merlot.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.904
Thank you, jack.

38:36.910 --> 38:39.072
I'll call you guys
in the morning.

38:39.080 --> 38:41.742
Thanks.

38:41.750 --> 38:43.343
Ok. You ready?

38:43.350 --> 38:44.317
Are you any better?

38:44.320 --> 38:46.345
You are gonna
get it tonight.

38:46.350 --> 38:47.943
You ready for this?

38:47.950 --> 38:48.940
Are you?

38:48.960 --> 38:50.314
[music continues]

38:50.320 --> 38:52.084
[knock on door]

38:53.690 --> 38:55.658
Lieutenant davis,
is everything all right?

38:55.660 --> 38:59.528
Yeah. I just stopped by to
see if you need any company?

38:59.530 --> 39:01.624
You've been
through a lot.

39:01.640 --> 39:05.463
I-I appreciate that,
um, but I'm fine.

39:05.470 --> 39:09.304
Still, you know, it's nice
to have friends in L.A.

39:09.310 --> 39:11.369
It can be
a scary place.

39:11.380 --> 39:13.178
Yeah, it can be.

39:13.180 --> 39:16.047
You know, there are
good people here.

39:16.050 --> 39:17.870
You just have to
find them,

39:17.880 --> 39:19.678
And eventually,
you do.

39:19.690 --> 39:23.149
At least that's what
happened to me.

39:23.160 --> 39:26.152
So you're ok?

39:26.160 --> 39:28.356
Yeah.

39:28.360 --> 39:30.658
Would you like
to come in?

39:30.660 --> 39:33.152
I could make us
some tea.

39:33.170 --> 39:35.468
That would be great.

39:55.490 --> 39:57.857
Whoa! Don't shoot!

39:57.860 --> 39:59.589
What are you
doing here?

39:59.590 --> 40:01.080
I changed my mind.

40:01.090 --> 40:03.730
Still want to
have a drink?

40:03.730 --> 40:05.198
2 or 3.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.349
Me, too.

40:06.370 --> 40:08.498
Can I ride with you?

40:08.500 --> 40:10.832
Yeah, get in.

40:10.840 --> 40:12.035
Just don't
sneak up on me.

40:12.040 --> 40:13.906
Not even sure if I
want to ride with you.

40:13.910 --> 40:15.332
Watch that,
watch that, watch that.

40:15.340 --> 40:17.877
Watch that corner,
watch the corner!

40:17.880 --> 40:21.100
[music continues]

40:32.590 --> 40:34.752
Ray: Excuse me.
