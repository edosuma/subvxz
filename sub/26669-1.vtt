00:27.001 --> 00:29.471
Where are you?

00:35.877 --> 00:38.348
Are you all grown up?

00:43.253 --> 00:46.122
Are you married?

00:51.860 --> 00:54.631
Are you a father?

01:00.971 --> 01:04.141
What happened to you?

01:16.987 --> 01:19.690
Stop smoking daddy.

01:30.702 --> 01:36.372
We're the perfect family
you know what that feels like,

01:36.374 --> 01:40.409
to have a perfect family?

01:40.411 --> 01:45.314
He begged me to come
visit with Johnny.

01:45.316 --> 01:48.552
No fuckin' way, I'm not going
to a prison with my son.

01:48.554 --> 01:53.690
It's all his fault that
Johnny's the way he is now.

01:53.692 --> 01:58.862
He has this scar,
it's right on his leg,

01:58.864 --> 02:01.832
right back here.

02:01.834 --> 02:04.337
Poor baby.

02:05.738 --> 02:10.407
He was such a sweet boy.

02:10.408 --> 02:13.379
A dog bit my son.

02:14.013 --> 02:16.482
I was angry.

02:17.917 --> 02:21.221
I wanted to get revenge.

02:22.388 --> 02:28.561
I am deeply, deeply sorry
for what I have done.

02:30.930 --> 02:32.230
I feel that I have
served my time

02:32.232 --> 02:36.668
and I am not the person
I was when I came in.

02:36.670 --> 02:40.405
That's good, because you need
to realize,

02:40.407 --> 02:42.808
you will be known as a ex-con,

02:42.810 --> 02:46.545
and people are going to be
egging you into situations,

02:46.547 --> 02:49.981
and getting a shotgun
for revenge

02:49.983 --> 02:53.454
is going to land you
back in here.

02:56.656 --> 03:01.395
I understand that I need
to control my emotions.

03:03.064 --> 03:04.798
What's the first thing
you're going to do

03:04.800 --> 03:09.068
when you are out in society?

03:09.070 --> 03:11.573
I'm going to find my son.

03:16.745 --> 03:18.748
(buzzer)

03:46.842 --> 03:49.945
What is that thing?

03:50.581 --> 03:52.448
What is that thing that's
standing in the way

03:52.450 --> 03:53.915
of us doing our job?

03:53.917 --> 03:57.487
You want to identify that.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.222
How you doin'?

04:00.224 --> 04:03.591
I spent a lot of time I
got to tell ya as a drunk.

04:03.593 --> 04:06.861
It's not about the drinkin',
it's all that other stuff

04:06.863 --> 04:13.469
that's stopping ya from seeing
where you belong in the world.

04:13.471 --> 04:15.737
Do we have control over that?

04:15.739 --> 04:19.709
Do we have the choice to say,
don't turn negativity

04:19.711 --> 04:23.482
into a daily feature of my life?

04:24.148 --> 04:28.550
Anxiety is gone.
Fear, gone.

04:28.552 --> 04:32.155
Guilt, what did I do?
It happened.

04:32.157 --> 04:33.490
Was that my fault?

04:33.492 --> 04:36.493
Do I have to live with that
the rest of my life?

04:36.495 --> 04:40.897
Or do I say, "Show me the way,
and I'll overcome it."

04:40.899 --> 04:43.900
That's pretty, pretty,
exciting stuff.

04:43.902 --> 04:46.739
Sober eight years.

04:49.207 --> 04:51.909
Everyday I get up and I say,

04:51.911 --> 04:57.181
"I am the instrument of
my own deliverance

04:57.183 --> 04:59.818
"from this world of insanity."

04:59.820 --> 05:03.591
My sanity I control.

05:38.158 --> 05:39.858
Hey, how you doing?

05:39.860 --> 05:42.695
Hank Tornac.

05:42.697 --> 05:45.331
Come on, here it goes,
here it goes.

05:45.333 --> 05:48.971
I'm transferrin' over
from Green Point.

05:51.573 --> 05:53.273
Don't let these guys
try to run this place.

05:53.275 --> 05:54.874
You let them know
this is your fuckin' house.

05:54.876 --> 05:58.712
Especially if they touch you,
because the goon squad's comin'

05:58.714 --> 06:00.881
and they're getting the fuckin'
boots put to 'em.

06:00.883 --> 06:02.015
Why'd you transfer?

06:02.017 --> 06:04.350
My ex is now gone,
she took my kid,

06:04.352 --> 06:07.253
you know, no longer close
to the facility

06:07.255 --> 06:10.289
so I figured I'd come up
to this area.

06:10.291 --> 06:12.259
I bet you shined
a few guy's heads.

06:12.261 --> 06:13.761
- (phone ringing)
- A little bit.

06:13.763 --> 06:17.699
But you got to be careful
because they want your job now,

06:17.701 --> 06:20.367
they want to suspend you
for doing the right thing.

06:20.369 --> 06:21.536
You know, I see these guys
at night

06:21.538 --> 06:24.137
see them jerking off,
doing all kinds of shit.

06:24.139 --> 06:25.872
You know, and then they come
out here they lift weights.

06:25.874 --> 06:29.177
It's all a show,
fake fucking tough guys.

06:29.179 --> 06:31.178
Management got your back?

06:31.180 --> 06:32.514
- Good brass has your back.
- Yeah.

06:32.516 --> 06:36.085
The chickenshit no-spines
don't have our back.

06:36.087 --> 06:38.589
Yeah.

06:47.231 --> 06:48.897
Who's the new C.O.?

06:48.899 --> 06:50.799
I don't know.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.066
All I know, we get a few more

06:52.068 --> 06:54.202
look like him we can be
runnin' this joint.

06:54.204 --> 06:57.709
Ho, ho, ho.

07:01.246 --> 07:04.413
Come on man,
I only got five years left.

07:04.415 --> 07:05.749
I'm allowed to think aren't I?

07:05.751 --> 07:07.150
Hell, you're not thinkin'
if you were thinkin'

07:07.152 --> 07:10.920
you're Queen wouldn't
be sittin' where it's sittin'.

07:10.922 --> 07:15.828
No (laughs).
Sorry, I wouldn't do that.

07:17.294 --> 07:18.461
- What would you do?
- I...

07:18.463 --> 07:22.198
Charlie, we playin'
for cigarettes.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.935
Oh, can I?
Just, one move?

07:25.937 --> 07:28.642
Hack's privilege.

07:32.110 --> 07:36.012
(laughs) Let me see here.

07:36.014 --> 07:41.185
Mm, I think that's check.

07:41.187 --> 07:45.221
- Whoa!
- That's bullshit!

07:45.223 --> 07:46.423
This game don't count.

07:46.425 --> 07:48.759
What you talking about,
you said it was okay.

07:48.761 --> 07:52.129
No, I said (mumbles) my ass.

07:52.131 --> 07:55.602
- Check.
- Yeah right.

07:59.205 --> 08:02.441
(laughs) Yeah, you got this
shit on the floor my nigger.

08:02.443 --> 08:06.744
Whoa, whoa (arguing).

08:06.746 --> 08:11.282
What the fuck do you
think you're doin'?

08:11.284 --> 08:12.452
You fuckin' new here son?

08:12.454 --> 08:14.454
You need to step
the fuck off homeboy.

08:14.456 --> 08:17.356
Hey, you clean this shit up,
you understand?

08:17.358 --> 08:19.125
- Or what?
- Or you're going to the shoe.

08:19.127 --> 08:20.293
That's what!

08:20.295 --> 08:22.260
- The shoe?
- Yeah.

08:22.262 --> 08:24.831
That's my second home.

08:24.833 --> 08:28.334
I own the motherfuckin' shoe.

08:28.336 --> 08:30.836
All you got is the
motherfucking shoe.

08:30.838 --> 08:32.136
You heard me,
you clean that up

08:32.139 --> 08:34.272
or you're all going down.

08:34.274 --> 08:35.440
Let's get this motherfucker.

08:35.442 --> 08:37.311
Hey, get off of me!

08:37.313 --> 08:40.080
Hey, don't pull me
into this shit!

08:40.082 --> 08:43.282
You want to start it with this
motherfucking scape of ours.

08:43.284 --> 08:46.320
You heard me. Let him go.

08:46.322 --> 08:49.388
No you don't, motherfucker.

08:49.390 --> 08:53.026
You know what?
Maybe you right.

08:53.028 --> 08:55.027
If I cut up a motherfuckin'
child killer like you

08:55.029 --> 08:58.532
ain't nobody going to
give a shit right?

08:58.534 --> 09:01.101
I've got two days left.

09:01.103 --> 09:04.807
Cut that motherfucker Mal,
why we talkin'?

09:10.347 --> 09:12.880
- Get him Mal!
- Hey!

09:12.882 --> 09:17.786
Get him Mal, fuck his ass up.

09:17.788 --> 09:19.988
Beat him! Get on him!

09:19.990 --> 09:22.059
(grunting)

09:27.931 --> 09:29.800
Green on green!
Fight in the...

09:30.334 --> 09:34.002
- Fuck!
- Come on Mal!

09:34.004 --> 09:37.338
One more step,
I break his fucking neck.

09:37.340 --> 09:38.573
One more step motherfucker...

09:38.575 --> 09:40.509
Green on green,
fight in the mess hall.

09:40.511 --> 09:44.947
This shit ain't over
motherfuckers.

09:44.949 --> 09:48.984
Hey, that's enough,
you're going to kill him.

09:48.986 --> 09:51.087
(choking)

09:51.089 --> 09:53.556
You want to spend the rest
of your life in here?

09:53.558 --> 09:55.727
Do you?

09:56.195 --> 09:58.129
(yelling)

10:07.505 --> 10:09.240
I owe you one.

10:13.379 --> 10:15.849
(coughing)

10:17.283 --> 10:20.153
Get your shit out of here.

10:31.998 --> 10:34.334
Last motherfuckin' day.

10:37.136 --> 10:40.140
- Advice?
- Yeah.

10:41.442 --> 10:47.081
In this game it's all about
motherfuckin' demons.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.819
Demons?

10:53.286 --> 10:56.089
The demon win or you win.

11:00.561 --> 11:04.398
While we're here we tame
the demon a little bit.

11:05.199 --> 11:12.572
But when you get back out there
that gives the demon juice, man.

11:12.574 --> 11:16.009
It's like he gets high,
and he starts to

11:16.011 --> 11:19.915
grab more, grab more, grab more.

11:22.050 --> 11:25.318
And you've got to fight harder,
and harder everyday

11:25.320 --> 11:27.987
to beat his ass.

11:27.989 --> 11:31.357
Like the wine-heads say,
"Beat him for a minute,

11:31.359 --> 11:34.962
"beat him for an hour,
beat him for a day."

11:34.964 --> 11:39.366
Hey, you're gettin' out soon.

11:39.368 --> 11:41.068
Oh man, what's with
the gangster grill man,

11:41.070 --> 11:42.602
it's just me and you out here.

11:42.604 --> 11:45.539
Water under the bridge, right?

11:45.541 --> 11:47.073
It's just good to see someone?

11:47.075 --> 11:52.046
Yeah, that's all I'm sayin'.

11:52.048 --> 11:53.714
Shit got a little out of hand
the other day.

11:53.716 --> 11:58.486
Yeah, I'm cool if you're coo.

11:58.488 --> 12:02.056
You got a son out there, right?

12:02.058 --> 12:02.891
Why?

12:02.893 --> 12:05.160
You want to look him up?

12:05.162 --> 12:06.964
Well, good luck.

12:09.032 --> 12:10.497
You best be quick about it then.

12:10.499 --> 12:12.368
Excuse me?

12:12.370 --> 12:17.305
(mumbles)

12:17.307 --> 12:20.041
Now, all I'm sayin' is that
I've got some brothers

12:20.043 --> 12:22.511
out there lookin' for him too.

12:22.513 --> 12:25.113
You'll be getting sloppy seconds
if they find him first.

12:25.115 --> 12:27.349
- What the fuck!
- Hey, back the fuck up!

12:27.351 --> 12:28.984
Back the fuck up asshole.

12:28.986 --> 12:31.052
It's not worth it.

12:31.054 --> 12:32.990
Back the fuck up.

12:34.524 --> 12:38.864
You have a good rest
of your life motherfucker.

12:41.433 --> 12:44.069
Knocked that motherfucker out
if he troubles you.

12:46.472 --> 12:49.942
- (laughter)
- Not worth it now.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.378
(buzzer)

13:28.748 --> 13:30.381
Sundstrom?

13:30.383 --> 13:33.488
95A4578.

13:52.173 --> 13:55.608
You're gettin' out,
congratulations.

13:55.610 --> 14:01.082
Yeah, maybe I'll buy you
beer on the outside sometime.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.087
Yeah, sure... maybe.

14:14.463 --> 14:18.367
Make sure you call.

14:52.336 --> 14:55.339
(engine purring)

15:14.758 --> 15:18.430
Yeah, it's 26.

15:21.498 --> 15:24.269
(rap music in background)

15:29.807 --> 15:32.044
What, are you waiting
for a fuckin' bus?

15:33.745 --> 15:36.646
Here's your key, if you lose it
you pay for another one

15:36.648 --> 15:38.583
right out of your pocket.

15:39.317 --> 15:41.584
You go to social services yet?

15:41.586 --> 15:43.522
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

16:36.277 --> 16:40.548
- (knocking)
- Can you get the door?

16:56.897 --> 16:58.666
I don't believe it.

17:05.308 --> 17:08.377
- Did you just get out?
- This morning.

17:11.047 --> 17:15.516
Well, you can't stay here.
I can't do that.

17:15.518 --> 17:17.554
I got a place.

17:18.553 --> 17:21.624
I don't got any money for
you either.

17:22.657 --> 17:24.059
How you doin'?

17:24.060 --> 17:27.430
How does it look
like I'm doin'?

17:31.401 --> 17:33.434
Is that your fault?

17:33.436 --> 17:35.002
Is everything my fault?

17:35.004 --> 17:39.508
Twenty years of no calls,
no letters.

17:39.510 --> 17:42.711
I was protecting myself,
protecting my son.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.578
What did I do?
Look at you.

17:44.580 --> 17:46.380
Why are you here?

17:46.382 --> 17:47.750
Need to find Johnny.

17:47.752 --> 17:50.752
Haven't seen him in years,
don't want to see him.

17:50.754 --> 17:53.856
- Why?
- Because he's gone bad.

17:53.858 --> 17:56.326
What kind of bad?

17:56.328 --> 18:00.396
Every kind of bad.

18:00.398 --> 18:02.365
You must have some way
of gettin' in touch.

18:02.367 --> 18:07.770
I don't.
What do you want from him?

18:07.772 --> 18:12.743
I don't want anything
from him, he's in trouble.

18:12.745 --> 18:13.877
Get him into more trouble!

18:13.879 --> 18:15.145
Me? Look at you!

18:15.147 --> 18:19.382
If he's gone bad it's you
and you're fuckin' drugs.

18:19.384 --> 18:20.650
You want to know about Johnny?

18:20.652 --> 18:21.851
Yeah, I want to know
about fuckin' Johnny!

18:21.853 --> 18:22.753
You want to fucking know
about Johnny?

18:22.755 --> 18:28.658
- Yeah, I do!
- Here!

18:28.660 --> 18:34.700
Check it out, straight A's.
No thanks to you.

18:42.042 --> 18:46.444
Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

18:46.446 --> 18:48.713
- This is your fault.
- My fault?

18:48.715 --> 18:49.947
- Yeah.
- Gina!

18:49.949 --> 18:51.116
Who are you?

18:51.118 --> 18:54.953
It's him isn't it?

18:54.955 --> 18:58.022
Where's Johnny?

18:58.024 --> 18:59.424
I can't help you.

18:59.426 --> 19:03.661
Hey, Gina, why don't you
go get dressed, all right?

19:03.663 --> 19:05.666
Go get some clothes on
all right?

19:06.633 --> 19:08.434
And you, you have no
reason to be here.

19:08.436 --> 19:09.601
Where's Johnny?

19:09.603 --> 19:11.803
Johnny isn't here,
Johnny doesn't live here.

19:11.805 --> 19:14.072
- Tell me where he is.
- She doesn't know!

19:14.074 --> 19:15.507
Now get the hell
out of this house.

19:15.509 --> 19:17.311
Shut the fuck up.

19:17.944 --> 19:19.813
(mumbles to herself) fuck him!

19:22.784 --> 19:26.085
I need help finding someone,
you guys do that kind of thing?

19:26.087 --> 19:27.789
Yeah, sure.

19:29.258 --> 19:35.429
He's on the phone right now,
you can fill this out first.

19:35.431 --> 19:37.831
I've been finding people
for 45 years.

19:37.833 --> 19:41.066
I've got access to databases,
I've got the motor vehicle,

19:41.068 --> 19:42.200
I've got credit scores.

19:42.202 --> 19:44.704
If he's on the grid
I can find him.

19:44.706 --> 19:47.475
If he's not it's going to take
a little more time

19:47.477 --> 19:48.976
and I'm going to have to go out
and huff it.

19:48.978 --> 19:50.177
And that's sometimes a little

19:50.179 --> 19:54.681
bit more involvement
moneywise and so on.

19:54.683 --> 19:57.117
How long does
it normally take?

19:57.119 --> 19:59.453
That varies, you know,
I mean you give me

19:59.455 --> 20:01.889
a retainer and then I get
the ball rollin'.

20:01.891 --> 20:03.257
- A retainer?
- A retainer.

20:03.259 --> 20:05.927
This is a missin' persons,
it's a thousand dollars

20:05.929 --> 20:08.228
and we don't take
personal checks, I wish we did.

20:08.230 --> 20:10.698
But we've been burned, you know?

20:10.700 --> 20:13.535
I don't have that
kind of money.

20:13.537 --> 20:16.204
What kind of
money do you have?

20:16.206 --> 20:21.108
(phone ringing)
Yeah?

20:21.110 --> 20:23.245
Simons, put him on.

20:23.247 --> 20:25.950
(laughs) Do you mind?

20:29.987 --> 20:32.988
I'm sorry about that.

20:32.990 --> 20:34.824
Sorry about what?

20:34.826 --> 20:37.693
I hear everything.

20:37.695 --> 20:42.499
I just can't imagine not seeing
your child for that long,

20:42.501 --> 20:46.169
and not even knowing
where he is.

20:46.171 --> 20:49.506
Yeah.

20:49.508 --> 20:52.174
How long were you in?

20:52.176 --> 20:53.375
I'm sorry?

20:53.377 --> 20:56.144
My brother was inside
for eight years,

20:56.146 --> 21:01.184
you have the same taste in tats.

21:01.186 --> 21:04.054
Twenty.

21:04.056 --> 21:07.191
- That's a long time.
- Yeah.

21:07.193 --> 21:09.727
(toilet flushing)
(screaming)

21:09.729 --> 21:11.529
What the fuck is that!
God damnit!

21:11.531 --> 21:12.963
- Baby what happened?
- Jesus Christ!

21:12.965 --> 21:15.532
He scared the shit out of me
with that fuckin' spider.

21:15.534 --> 21:17.067
Look at the mess I'm in!
Yeah, this!

21:17.069 --> 21:18.468
My spider!

21:18.470 --> 21:20.002
Your little spider's going
down the fuckin' toilet.

21:20.004 --> 21:23.207
And you'd better get a sitter
by tomorrow or don't come in.

21:23.209 --> 21:24.943
You here me? Don't come in!

21:24.945 --> 21:26.211
Hey, he's just a kid.

21:26.213 --> 21:27.078
What'd you say?

21:27.080 --> 21:28.379
I said relax, he's just a kid.

21:28.381 --> 21:31.116
And I said take your fucking
hand off of me.

21:31.118 --> 21:32.350
You hear me?

21:32.352 --> 21:33.652
- I said he's just a kid.
- It's okay, it's okay.

21:33.654 --> 21:39.223
Now take a fucking walk.
Keep fuckin' going.

21:39.225 --> 21:42.963
Yeah, oh, I'm shaking.
Get the fuck out of here.

22:09.122 --> 22:11.925
So what's up, yeah. Tell me.

22:11.927 --> 22:14.764
(circular saw running)

22:20.002 --> 22:23.973
Oh right, see,
there's a problem right there.

22:27.375 --> 22:30.779
You know, if it's pizza...

22:32.614 --> 22:35.283
- Is it a good time?
- Sit down, it's busy.

22:35.285 --> 22:37.487
Be out in a second.

22:38.121 --> 22:41.622
But you know, this,
this is different my friend.

22:41.624 --> 22:42.991
You know, you place the order...

22:42.993 --> 22:45.158
You motherfucker!

22:45.160 --> 22:48.262
Hey! Hey! You're
not listening.

22:48.264 --> 22:51.068
There is no
fucking cancellation.

22:53.035 --> 22:55.738
Hank! My man!

22:59.242 --> 23:01.546
Go ahead and take a seat.

23:02.912 --> 23:04.912
This is good?

23:04.914 --> 23:06.917
It's all good.

23:07.317 --> 23:09.820
- You got my money?
- No.

23:12.323 --> 23:13.488
(groans) Did you just say,
"No." to me?

23:13.490 --> 23:18.427
I know, I'm sorry,
but I, I, I don't got it.

23:18.429 --> 23:20.996
Stop playing with me bro,
you know?

23:20.998 --> 23:22.496
Don't worry.

23:22.498 --> 23:23.999
I'm not worried, I don't like
people changing the deal.

23:24.001 --> 23:27.937
But the money is in play,
I, I just need the money now.

23:27.939 --> 23:29.005
For how long?

23:29.007 --> 23:32.007
You'll get
everything Thursday.

23:32.009 --> 23:34.076
Rules are rules,
that's another six points.

23:34.078 --> 23:36.412
Okay, six points.

23:36.414 --> 23:41.217
Oh, another thing,
I need another 10 grand.

23:41.219 --> 23:43.353
(laughs)

23:43.355 --> 23:44.453
You're going to get it back.

23:44.455 --> 23:46.022
You fuckin' serious?

23:46.024 --> 23:48.124
You want somebody to jerk you
off you get one of these guys.

23:48.126 --> 23:51.828
If you want a return
on your investment I'm your man.

23:51.830 --> 23:54.998
You don't ask for much!

23:55.000 --> 23:57.170
That's it.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.009
(sighs)

24:20.793 --> 24:26.800
Tell me, what is it
that you fuckin' do?

24:28.167 --> 24:29.701
I mean, you know...

24:29.703 --> 24:35.808
I make a profit and I return
that profit to you I believe.

24:35.810 --> 24:37.276
Well, he's got a few things
going but he's not going

24:37.278 --> 24:39.377
to tell us what they are is he?

24:39.379 --> 24:42.984
You'll get it back,
you know that.

24:47.054 --> 24:49.922
I'm always interested
in new businesses.

24:49.924 --> 24:52.491
You got anything for me,
your friend?

24:52.493 --> 24:53.760
You serious?

24:53.762 --> 24:55.761
We're having a serious
conversation right now.

24:55.763 --> 24:57.096
- No, I'm serious.
- Right.

24:57.098 --> 24:59.966
You want a taste I might
have a few things for ya.

24:59.968 --> 25:02.903
- Yeah, I want a taste.
- Okay.

25:02.905 --> 25:04.303
- Thursday.
- Thursday?

25:04.305 --> 25:05.539
You got it!

25:05.541 --> 25:08.474
- Otherwise...
- Bad things happen, right?

25:08.476 --> 25:11.377
You said it, not me.

25:11.379 --> 25:13.782
Get the man his money,
all right?

25:43.813 --> 25:45.715
Nice car.

25:47.918 --> 25:50.552
Oh man, it's good to see you.

25:50.554 --> 25:51.520
It's good to see you!

25:51.522 --> 25:53.955
You too.

25:53.957 --> 25:56.324
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

25:56.326 --> 25:57.859
Yeah.

25:57.861 --> 25:59.494
You want to go for a ride?

25:59.496 --> 26:00.361
Do I want to go for a ride?

26:00.363 --> 26:01.696
Yeah.

26:01.698 --> 26:04.002
- What the fuck do you think?
- Get in the car.

26:27.426 --> 26:29.128
Wow, (laughs).

26:30.429 --> 26:31.861
Hey, remember that time
I threw a brick

26:31.863 --> 26:35.932
and bust that window?

26:35.934 --> 26:37.534
The plant manager came
runnin' out.

26:37.536 --> 26:40.137
What's that guy's name?

26:40.139 --> 26:42.109
- Igor.
- Igor.

26:44.943 --> 26:47.378
You're fired motherfucker,
you fired.

26:47.380 --> 26:49.613
You ran like hell.

26:49.615 --> 26:52.015
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

26:52.017 --> 26:54.755
I should've known then.

26:57.556 --> 27:01.325
You know, I never got a chance
to thank you.

27:01.327 --> 27:02.896
For what?

27:04.565 --> 27:06.901
For not ratting on me man.

27:07.468 --> 27:10.468
You know, that probably
got you a bunch of extra years.

27:10.470 --> 27:17.912
No, that was my beef.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.612
That was the last dumb
thing I did.

27:21.614 --> 27:25.218
Scared me straight,
bought a garage.

27:25.220 --> 27:26.920
I need to talk to you
about Johnny.

27:26.922 --> 27:29.488
Johnny, how's he doin'?

27:29.490 --> 27:31.326
(glass shattering)

27:34.496 --> 27:35.894
That's fucked up man!

27:35.896 --> 27:39.932
You still in touch with
anybody from the old days?

27:39.934 --> 27:43.038
I try not to be, but yeah,
know a few.

27:43.605 --> 27:46.074
You think you can ask around?

27:47.175 --> 27:49.077
Of course.

27:49.645 --> 27:54.818
One more thing, I need a gun.

28:08.396 --> 28:10.366
Hey, glad you called.

28:12.368 --> 28:14.405
How you doin'?

28:17.540 --> 28:19.507
Malvin put a hit on my son.

28:19.509 --> 28:23.644
Wow, whoa! You serious?

28:23.646 --> 28:27.315
Oh man, that piece of shit!

28:27.317 --> 28:29.616
He's got a lot of ties
on the outside.

28:29.618 --> 28:31.251
You might want to warn your son.

28:31.253 --> 28:33.721
Well, that's the thing,
I can't find him.

28:33.723 --> 28:34.891
You don't know where he is?

28:34.893 --> 28:37.125
No, I tried my ex,
that was a waste of time.

28:37.127 --> 28:39.194
Anything I can do, can I help?

28:39.196 --> 28:41.329
Yeah, talk to Malvin's crew.

28:41.331 --> 28:43.031
You know, see what
the guys are saying.

28:43.033 --> 28:46.434
(laughs) I mean after what
went down

28:46.436 --> 28:48.104
he's not going to talk to me.

28:48.106 --> 28:49.504
You owe me for what went down.

28:49.506 --> 28:55.377
I owe you big time,
and I'm going to pay you back.

28:55.379 --> 28:57.312
But you're asking me to

28:57.314 --> 28:59.782
poke a stick into a
hornet's nest.

28:59.784 --> 29:03.619
I'm the new guy,
nobody's got my back.

29:03.621 --> 29:06.423
Keep 'em comin'. Two.

29:06.425 --> 29:08.426
(sighs)

29:11.030 --> 29:13.032
You got kids?

29:14.366 --> 29:18.137
Yeah, daughter.

29:20.638 --> 29:23.376
Daughter?

29:24.444 --> 29:27.211
You get to see her much?

29:27.213 --> 29:30.348
No, no, I don't see her.

29:30.350 --> 29:36.454
I want to, but you know,

29:36.456 --> 29:43.761
people, stuff, I try to be
a good father,

29:43.763 --> 29:46.129
but the courts are against ya.

29:46.131 --> 29:49.267
Life has a way of takin'
those things

29:49.269 --> 29:52.339
that you care about
and kind of...

29:53.673 --> 29:56.443
About those fuckin' drinks!

29:57.143 --> 30:00.611
When was the last time
you saw your son?

30:00.613 --> 30:02.714
The day I went in.

30:02.716 --> 30:04.782
He never came for a visit?

30:04.784 --> 30:07.956
No, nothin'.

30:11.593 --> 30:13.626
Jesus.

30:13.628 --> 30:17.299
Yeah, it sucks.

30:21.402 --> 30:25.104
You know, I ask
the wrong questions

30:25.106 --> 30:28.373
and I end up with a knife
in my back.

30:28.375 --> 30:32.314
But I'll do what I can,
all right?

30:34.784 --> 30:37.988
(panting)

30:40.422 --> 30:42.392
(sighs)

31:36.513 --> 31:38.315
Charlie?

31:39.317 --> 31:41.318
Hi, Helen.

31:41.586 --> 31:42.517
Yeah.

31:42.519 --> 31:43.753
- Can I...
- Please, sit.

31:43.755 --> 31:46.556
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Of course.

31:46.558 --> 31:48.124
I did a little arm
twisting myself.

31:48.126 --> 31:54.198
I got grandma to look after him
for the next two weeks anyway.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.431
Do you want a smoke?

31:55.433 --> 31:59.202
No, no, thanks.

31:59.204 --> 32:04.077
Are you having any luck
with your son?

32:07.512 --> 32:08.812
You know what?

32:08.814 --> 32:09.912
I've been working at that place
for two years.

32:09.914 --> 32:12.884
I know how to get into
the system.

32:12.886 --> 32:16.421
Not from my desk,
but through his computer.

32:16.423 --> 32:19.856
I wouldn't be able to do
anything until Friday.

32:19.858 --> 32:23.327
He goes out for a liquid lunch
with his buddies every Friday.

32:23.329 --> 32:25.262
But I could slip in then.

32:25.264 --> 32:31.170
It's not a guarantee,
I'll do my best, I promise.

32:32.973 --> 32:35.710
Do you think he'll be
happy to see you?

32:42.782 --> 32:45.486
I don't know.

32:56.763 --> 32:58.667
(bell rings)

33:06.475 --> 33:08.209
(knocking)

33:12.546 --> 33:14.414
Cool. There he is.
How you doing?

33:14.416 --> 33:15.248
Hey.

33:15.250 --> 33:16.816
Look what I got for you.

33:16.818 --> 33:19.819
Look what I got for you.

33:19.821 --> 33:21.756
Look at these.

33:23.626 --> 33:25.762
Boom. Boom.

33:29.564 --> 33:32.168
That's what you're
looking for right?

33:33.069 --> 33:34.935
Hey, they clean?

33:34.937 --> 33:37.070
Yeah, never been used brother.

33:37.072 --> 33:39.540
Never been used.

33:39.542 --> 33:42.409
This one has a nice
weight to it.

33:42.411 --> 33:45.414
Never seen any action.

33:48.852 --> 33:50.452
That's good right?

33:50.454 --> 33:54.358
It sticks a little.
A little bit.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.535
You lookin' for somebody?

34:08.005 --> 34:13.342
(indistinct conversation)

34:13.344 --> 34:15.476
Hey, can I help you?

34:15.478 --> 34:17.880
Yeah, I was looking
for Charlie.

34:17.882 --> 34:19.081
There he is.

34:19.083 --> 34:20.215
- Hey.
- What's going on?

34:20.217 --> 34:21.918
Yeah, the guy in the
halfway house

34:21.920 --> 34:24.753
said I'd find you here.

34:24.755 --> 34:25.887
Is this your place?

34:25.889 --> 34:27.054
This is.

34:27.056 --> 34:28.356
Man, I should bring my wreck
in here.

34:28.358 --> 34:30.360
You guys look like you know
what you're doin'.

34:30.362 --> 34:33.061
A little bit. Bring it in.

34:33.063 --> 34:36.833
- You got any news?
- Yeah.

34:36.835 --> 34:40.136
There's an OTB a couple blocks
down the street.

34:40.138 --> 34:42.038
You wanna talk there?

34:42.040 --> 34:43.107
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

34:43.109 --> 34:46.877
- Hank Tornac.
- Ah, Mike Keegan.

34:46.879 --> 34:49.913
Nice to meet you Mike.

34:49.915 --> 34:52.252
See ya in a bit.

34:59.025 --> 35:01.025
Who's that?

35:01.027 --> 35:03.894
That's the CO.

35:03.896 --> 35:07.798
That's the fuckin' CO that
caused all this shit for you?

35:07.800 --> 35:08.867
That guy?

35:08.869 --> 35:09.867
Does that run?

35:09.869 --> 35:10.901
Yeah, kind of.

35:10.903 --> 35:14.405
Can I borrow it?

35:14.407 --> 35:16.508
I can do that.

35:16.510 --> 35:20.144
You just got to promise me
one thing.

35:20.146 --> 35:23.549
What's that?

35:23.551 --> 35:25.951
You got to give me some time
to find the kid, man.

35:25.953 --> 35:27.819
I don't want you usin' the gun.

35:27.821 --> 35:32.827
(laughs) Trust me, I don't
wanna use it either.

35:44.205 --> 35:47.706
And the CO you guys call
Spaceman.

35:47.708 --> 35:50.976
I've known him since Green Point
and he's tight with...

35:50.978 --> 35:52.913
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute, don't fall back,

35:52.915 --> 35:54.847
she's got a kick, it's comin'.

35:54.849 --> 35:55.615
She's got a kick.

35:55.617 --> 35:57.117
Who's he tight with?

35:57.119 --> 35:58.952
With Malvin and them.

35:58.954 --> 36:00.519
He's got an inside...

36:00.521 --> 36:03.056
Come on, she's gettin'
fenced in.

36:03.058 --> 36:05.958
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

36:05.960 --> 36:11.867
Shit! Shit! Shit!

36:23.213 --> 36:26.483
You all right?

36:32.622 --> 36:34.826
Yeah.

36:40.898 --> 36:43.501
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:46.770 --> 36:51.739
Yeah, I'm all right,
it's just a fuckin' race.

36:51.741 --> 36:55.812
Give me another one
will ya, Tony?

37:01.052 --> 37:05.021
All right, look,

37:05.023 --> 37:07.155
there's somethin' going on.

37:07.157 --> 37:08.656
What?

37:08.658 --> 37:13.530
Good news is they don't have
any idea where your son is.

37:13.532 --> 37:15.564
Who has no idea where
my son is?

37:15.566 --> 37:19.167
Malvin, he's got his cousin
on the outside and all his guys,

37:19.169 --> 37:20.803
he's got his... you know...

37:20.805 --> 37:23.040
he's got everybody lookin'
for him,

37:23.042 --> 37:26.710
but we got, we got, the ear.

37:26.712 --> 37:28.212
So I told you I'd take care
of you.

37:28.214 --> 37:30.547
I'm taking care of you.

37:30.549 --> 37:32.815
That's your plan?

37:32.817 --> 37:34.652
It's my fuckin' plan,
it's what it is.

37:34.654 --> 37:37.888
I'll tell you when I hear
anything else.

37:37.890 --> 37:41.558
What? What?

37:41.560 --> 37:45.628
I'm going to take care of you
on this.

37:45.630 --> 37:46.731
Give me some information.

37:46.733 --> 37:48.066
I'm a fucking
piece of shit con.

37:48.068 --> 37:51.202
I'm out, and I'm trying
to find my fuckin' son.

37:51.204 --> 37:52.604
How do you know his life
is in danger?

37:52.606 --> 37:56.575
Because K99 put a hit on him.

37:56.577 --> 37:58.977
K99 is a nasty gang.

37:58.979 --> 38:00.111
What's your involvement?

38:00.113 --> 38:03.948
They don't play with
people like you.

38:03.950 --> 38:05.950
What I don't get is
what kind of information

38:05.952 --> 38:08.986
could you have when you're
standing up for a CO?

38:08.988 --> 38:10.822
What are you protecting him for,

38:10.824 --> 38:13.725
that's going to have Malvin
come after you?

38:13.727 --> 38:15.728
Or more importantly,
after your son?

38:15.730 --> 38:17.096
Can you help me or not?

38:17.098 --> 38:18.330
Look, here's the deal.

38:18.332 --> 38:21.900
We're not in the business
of trying to find people

38:21.902 --> 38:24.069
you lost 20 years ago,
that's not what we do.

38:24.071 --> 38:26.839
Okay, you've got all sorts
of other avenues for that.

38:26.841 --> 38:29.641
What I would suggest
with this Malvin guy,

38:29.643 --> 38:33.612
go to his cousin Delroy Gibbons.

38:33.614 --> 38:35.048
He's got a barbershop down on,

38:35.050 --> 38:37.150
what is it, Martin Luther King
down by the interstate.

38:37.152 --> 38:42.622
You want information about K99,
go talk to Delroy.

38:42.624 --> 38:45.795
(station chatter)

38:48.197 --> 38:51.633
(street noise)

39:08.651 --> 39:10.987
Hey, is Delroy around?

39:12.354 --> 39:14.689
Lookin' for Delroy.

39:14.691 --> 39:16.323
What you want with Delroy?

39:16.325 --> 39:19.393
I got a message from Malvin.

39:19.395 --> 39:21.161
You was locked up with him,
you just came home?

39:21.163 --> 39:22.364
Yeah, we were up state.

39:22.366 --> 39:24.666
Yo, this nigga knows Malvin.
Beat that.

39:24.668 --> 39:27.101
My nigga Malvin, man,
send him my love.

39:27.103 --> 39:28.369
So what you need with Delroy?

39:28.371 --> 39:29.905
Oh, we got some business.

39:29.907 --> 39:31.139
All right, he know you comin'?

39:31.141 --> 39:32.874
Yeah.

39:32.876 --> 39:34.342
You all get next
one in the game.

39:34.344 --> 39:37.748
My nigga, save me some of that
cigarette too, all right?

39:46.057 --> 39:50.292
I'm Charlie Sundstrom.

39:50.294 --> 39:54.096
I'm here to make you an offer.

39:54.098 --> 39:56.966
See, I'm the one who
put the hurt on Malvin.

39:56.968 --> 39:59.468
My son, he had nothin'
to do with it.

39:59.470 --> 40:02.839
So, you do whatever you
want to me.

40:02.841 --> 40:04.774
I'm sure you've been inside,
things happen.

40:04.776 --> 40:06.142
- No, I haven't.
- Okay.

40:06.144 --> 40:07.276
I've never been locked up.

40:07.278 --> 40:11.215
Well, shit's pretty ugly
in there.

40:11.217 --> 40:14.851
Things got out of hand.

40:14.853 --> 40:17.288
You seem like you need
to get back on your meds,

40:17.290 --> 40:18.623
because you're clearly crazy.

40:18.625 --> 40:23.159
Listen man, you come in here
to my establishment,

40:23.161 --> 40:24.962
you got your chest puffed out,

40:24.964 --> 40:27.197
who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

40:27.199 --> 40:28.433
I mean you clearly walked into

40:28.435 --> 40:31.735
a place that you're not
in charge, right?

40:31.737 --> 40:36.142
You got this demeanor
like you are, but you're not.

40:42.983 --> 40:46.620
Relax, relax. Hey, hey. Relax.

40:47.521 --> 40:50.725
(distorted voices)

40:55.095 --> 40:57.632
(horn blares)

41:14.315 --> 41:16.685
(trunk slams)

41:51.555 --> 41:52.821
You're the guy with the son?

41:52.823 --> 41:53.989
Yeah, what about my son?

41:53.991 --> 41:55.924
Well, I heard Mike
was looking for your son,

41:55.926 --> 41:57.324
and he was talking to some
dude on the phone.

41:57.326 --> 41:59.092
Did he find my son?

41:59.094 --> 41:59.726
I don't know.

41:59.728 --> 42:01.062
Is Mike around?

42:01.064 --> 42:03.263
No, he hasn't gotten in yet.

42:03.265 --> 42:07.203
He's supposed to get in at 9:30.

42:26.257 --> 42:27.892
Hey, Mike!

42:30.862 --> 42:33.164
(knocking)
Mike!

42:34.399 --> 42:36.268
(knocking)

42:38.870 --> 42:41.973
Mike, you here?

43:12.170 --> 43:14.104
Mike.

43:14.106 --> 43:17.043
(solemn music)

43:33.327 --> 43:35.162
Fuck!
(gasps)

43:41.368 --> 43:43.070
Fuck!

44:01.656 --> 44:04.157
Dad?

44:04.159 --> 44:06.228
Yeah son?

44:11.566 --> 44:14.236
Where's the dog?

44:15.271 --> 44:17.372
The dog's not here.

44:23.479 --> 44:26.115
Dog's not here.

44:41.565 --> 44:45.002
I don't want the dog
to come in.

44:49.406 --> 44:51.406
The dog's not comin' in.

44:51.408 --> 44:53.877
(glass breaking)

45:29.415 --> 45:33.049
Hank, it's Charlie.

45:33.051 --> 45:35.086
Yeah, we gotta talk.

46:01.347 --> 46:03.514
Hey, hey. Come on.

46:03.516 --> 46:05.615
Where you been?

46:05.617 --> 46:06.684
Delroy and his gang,

46:06.686 --> 46:07.885
they fuckin' shot
Mike and his wife.

46:07.887 --> 46:11.089
Your buddy from the garage?
His wife?

46:11.091 --> 46:12.290
Fuckin' animals.

46:12.292 --> 46:13.491
Well, what did they
have to do with your son?

46:13.493 --> 46:15.761
I'm thinking maybe I'll
go back to the police.

46:15.763 --> 46:17.495
If you come with me
they'll listen this time.

46:17.497 --> 46:20.232
Uh, no, no, no.

46:20.234 --> 46:25.870
That's past,
there's no time for that.

46:25.872 --> 46:27.839
What do you mean?

46:27.841 --> 46:34.381
Look, I got a call,
I know where Johnny is.

46:35.516 --> 46:36.516
You know where Johnny is?

46:36.518 --> 46:38.117
Yeah.

46:38.119 --> 46:40.353
When the fuck were you
going to tell me?

46:40.355 --> 46:44.557
Look, first I just have to
tell ya about this.

46:44.559 --> 46:46.258
I'm in trouble Charlie.

46:46.260 --> 46:47.293
What the fuck are you talk...

46:47.295 --> 46:48.760
Give me two minutes.
Come on.

46:48.762 --> 46:52.798
I promise ya, I'll tell ya,
but I just need two minutes.

46:52.800 --> 46:54.666
Start fuckin' talking.

46:54.668 --> 46:58.172
Look, I got a
gambling problem,

46:58.174 --> 47:01.142
and I owe this guy
a lot of money.

47:01.144 --> 47:03.810
It's a disease, I can't help it.

47:03.812 --> 47:06.446
I owe Shyboy a
shitload of money.

47:06.448 --> 47:07.781
- Shyboy?
- Yeah.

47:07.783 --> 47:09.415
What kind of name is that?

47:09.417 --> 47:12.285
It's a shy, Shylock. Shyster.

47:12.287 --> 47:14.821
He's not shy, believe me.

47:14.823 --> 47:16.857
He says I've got until tomorrow.

47:16.859 --> 47:20.294
Tomorrow?
What happens tomorrow?

47:20.296 --> 47:24.833
He smashed two of my fingers
in my hand.

47:24.835 --> 47:26.835
It's not going to be good.

47:26.837 --> 47:30.472
It's not going to be good.

47:30.474 --> 47:32.173
That's not my problem.

47:32.175 --> 47:34.476
I want you to make
it your problem.

47:34.478 --> 47:39.748
I want you to make my problem
go away, permanent.

47:39.750 --> 47:41.282
I can't do that.

47:41.284 --> 47:42.449
What do you mean?

47:42.451 --> 47:43.585
You know I can't.

47:43.587 --> 47:44.952
This is just a...

47:44.954 --> 47:48.191
This guy's a psychopath,
this guys deserves to die.

47:48.193 --> 47:50.760
Murder is murder, Hank.

47:50.762 --> 47:52.727
What about me, huh?

47:52.729 --> 47:54.497
He's going to murder me.

47:54.499 --> 47:56.799
What about my life, huh?

47:56.801 --> 48:00.870
I make a mistake I, I die?

48:00.872 --> 48:01.937
There's got to be another way.

48:01.939 --> 48:05.376
- There is no other way.
- And I'm sorry.

48:07.879 --> 48:12.215
I really am.

48:12.217 --> 48:16.489
Yeah? I know.

48:21.759 --> 48:24.429
And I'm sorry too.

48:32.003 --> 48:33.805
Where's my son?

48:33.807 --> 48:36.774
Yeah, we're runnin'
out of time.

48:36.776 --> 48:41.879
You do for me
and I'll do for you.

48:41.881 --> 48:44.649
Don't fuck with me Hank.

48:44.651 --> 48:46.850
You tell me where he is,
right fucking now,

48:46.852 --> 48:48.251
or I swear to God
I'll shoot you myself.

48:48.253 --> 48:50.955
That's good, you won't shoot
some lowlife scumbag,

48:50.957 --> 48:52.589
but you'll put a bullet in me?

48:52.591 --> 48:54.591
That's the way you
fix things, huh?

48:54.593 --> 48:56.995
Where's my son!

48:56.997 --> 48:59.533
Come on!

49:04.739 --> 49:06.938
You think I won't?

49:06.940 --> 49:10.245
Is that what you fuckin' think?

49:13.748 --> 49:17.282
Don't fucking try me, okay.

49:17.284 --> 49:20.485
Yeah, come on, come on, do it.

49:20.487 --> 49:24.760
Pull it. Fuck you! Pull it!

49:27.429 --> 49:30.331
Fuck!

49:33.334 --> 49:40.807
I'm trading for my life here,

49:40.809 --> 49:44.510
does that make me a bad guy?

49:44.512 --> 49:47.316
Does it?

49:49.352 --> 49:52.455
Don't make me beg.

50:01.931 --> 50:06.236
I got, I got nothin'.

50:12.008 --> 50:15.378
Come on!

50:33.365 --> 50:36.435
(exhales deeply)

50:54.151 --> 50:56.785
How is he?

50:56.787 --> 50:59.523
He's fuckin' traumatized.

51:02.561 --> 51:08.568
In this game, it's all about
motherfuckin' demons.

51:12.570 --> 51:15.308
Demons man.

51:18.076 --> 51:21.514
The demon win or you win.

51:23.550 --> 51:24.716
Charlie, come on man,

51:24.718 --> 51:26.651
we're talking about a dog,
it's a dog.

51:26.653 --> 51:29.553
This fuckin' dog's got to pay.

51:29.555 --> 51:31.823
What's done is done brother,
it's over.

51:31.825 --> 51:33.424
We got to sit here,
we'll watch the kid.

51:33.426 --> 51:34.959
Gina will be home in a minute.

51:34.961 --> 51:38.332
You fuckin' comin' or not?

52:28.950 --> 52:31.586
We should do it here.

52:51.174 --> 52:53.007
Can you get him here?

52:53.009 --> 52:57.781
Oh yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

52:59.550 --> 53:01.916
What about the neighbors?

53:01.918 --> 53:03.919
We'll do it in the basement.

53:03.921 --> 53:08.557
Nobody sees, nobody hears.

53:08.559 --> 53:10.791
And the body?

53:10.793 --> 53:16.433
There's a lake five
miles away, back roads.

53:28.078 --> 53:30.783
The sooner the better.

53:33.817 --> 53:36.618
Hank, are you wasting
my fuckin' time right now?

53:36.620 --> 53:40.022
Absolutely not.
I respect you way too much.

53:40.024 --> 53:41.757
We've had our differences
but I...

53:41.759 --> 53:43.225
Do you or do you not
have my money right now?

53:43.227 --> 53:44.527
Yeah, I got the money.

53:44.529 --> 53:47.130
You got my money?
So where the fuck are you?

53:47.132 --> 53:49.566
I want to show you what
I've been doin' all this time.

53:49.568 --> 53:54.104
I mean this thing is paying off
big time, in spades.

53:54.106 --> 53:56.307
I'm telling you,
when you see the

53:56.309 --> 53:59.309
(mumbles) shit that we've
been going after

53:59.311 --> 54:01.579
and what's available with this-

54:01.581 --> 54:03.713
- You think you can get
into his computer tonight?

54:03.715 --> 54:08.586
No. He locks his office
at night.

54:08.588 --> 54:12.725
Things are kind of on
a fast track.

54:14.595 --> 54:15.993
Are you okay?

54:15.995 --> 54:18.062
Yeah. Yeah.

54:18.064 --> 54:24.069
Just gotta do somethin'
that I don't want to do.

54:24.071 --> 54:26.870
Do what exactly?

54:26.872 --> 54:29.042
I'll be fine.

54:29.743 --> 54:32.076
You remember my brother,
the one who went to prison?

54:32.078 --> 54:33.378
Yeah.

54:33.380 --> 54:35.280
Right before he got caught
for armed robbery

54:35.282 --> 54:40.753
we had the same
kind of conversation.

54:40.755 --> 54:46.661
Whatever it is, don't do it,
wait till tomorrow Charlie.

55:00.975 --> 55:06.515
I just talked to him,
he's on his way.

55:36.346 --> 55:37.811
Still loaded?

55:37.813 --> 55:40.951
You checked that 20 minutes ago.

55:44.286 --> 55:46.455
He should be here by now.

55:46.457 --> 55:49.323
You all right?

55:49.325 --> 55:50.392
Am I all right?

55:50.394 --> 55:51.959
Yeah.

55:51.961 --> 55:55.566
Yeah, I'm all right.
You all right?

55:59.070 --> 56:02.006
(sighs) Fuck!

56:06.242 --> 56:09.781
(engine running)

56:18.389 --> 56:23.027
Let's do this fast
so we can find your son.

56:33.238 --> 56:34.104
You found it?

56:34.106 --> 56:35.506
Sure did.

56:35.508 --> 56:38.178
Come on.

56:46.151 --> 56:47.484
Want a drink?

56:47.486 --> 56:50.823
Sure, I mean we got
a lot to talk about right?

56:54.927 --> 56:56.227
Drink?

56:56.229 --> 56:57.929
I don't want shit.

56:57.931 --> 57:01.299
Oh, you smoke,
I never knew you smoked.

57:01.301 --> 57:02.299
Yeah.

57:02.301 --> 57:03.201
That's not good for you
my friend,

57:03.203 --> 57:04.201
you know, got to stay healthy

57:04.203 --> 57:06.138
if we want to do business
together.

57:06.140 --> 57:07.806
I know.

57:07.808 --> 57:08.674
What happened to your hand?

57:08.676 --> 57:11.442
- (groans)
- Sorry (laughs).

57:11.444 --> 57:12.210
You're a funny guy.

57:12.212 --> 57:13.277
So where's my cash?

57:13.279 --> 57:15.447
Yeah. Yeah.

57:15.449 --> 57:17.752
You ready to make some money?

57:20.154 --> 57:22.024
(groans)

57:32.467 --> 57:35.269
Here we go.

57:36.371 --> 57:40.275
Ah, (laughs).

57:47.448 --> 57:53.219
This is (grunts)

57:53.221 --> 57:55.892
thirty-thousand dollars.

57:57.225 --> 57:58.457
Sounds about right.

57:58.459 --> 58:01.562
Sounds about right (laughs).

58:01.564 --> 58:04.364
You know, when you're
contemplating

58:04.366 --> 58:09.304
a successful start
to an enterprise

58:09.306 --> 58:11.438
which I believe we are,

58:11.440 --> 58:14.374
those are important
questions to ask.

58:14.376 --> 58:15.976
What questions?

58:15.978 --> 58:18.847
Well, what exactly is enough?

58:18.849 --> 58:22.182
Do you lose yourself
in the panoply

58:22.184 --> 58:27.521
of all possibility, where excess
is the only debt in town,

58:27.523 --> 58:28.690
you know what I mean?

58:28.692 --> 58:29.824
No, I don't know
what you mean Hank.

58:29.826 --> 58:30.791
What the fuck are you
talking about?

58:30.793 --> 58:33.328
I'll show you
your money today,

58:33.330 --> 58:36.364
but I also want to show you
your money tomorrow,

58:36.366 --> 58:39.134
and next week, and next year.

58:39.136 --> 58:40.935
Well, let's start with what's
in the briefcase, shall we?

58:40.937 --> 58:43.872
Well, that's a start (laughs).

58:43.874 --> 58:45.006
So let's open it.

58:45.008 --> 58:47.176
You want to see the...

58:47.178 --> 58:50.115
Shut the fuck up!

58:55.486 --> 58:58.256
Fuckin' nothin'!

59:00.192 --> 59:01.624
Let's snap this motherfucker's
neck bone.

59:01.626 --> 59:05.195
Hold up, hold up, Hank,
where the fuck is the money?

59:05.197 --> 59:06.496
Wait a minute, I thought we
were going to be talking.

59:06.498 --> 59:08.530
I'm not going to have
thirty-thousand dollars

59:08.532 --> 59:10.166
for him to...

59:10.168 --> 59:12.268
What the fuck
is going on Hank?

59:12.270 --> 59:14.036
Where's my fucking money?

59:14.038 --> 59:16.405
Get your fuckin'
hands off him!

59:16.407 --> 59:18.374
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:18.376 --> 59:19.175
Right there.

59:19.177 --> 59:20.409
Who the fuck are you?

59:20.411 --> 59:21.345
- Doesn't matter who I am.
- What the fuck!

59:21.347 --> 59:23.314
- On your fuckin' knees!
- What!

59:23.316 --> 59:24.115
Right fuckin' now.

59:24.117 --> 59:26.149
All right. All right.

59:26.151 --> 59:28.187
All right.

59:30.923 --> 59:34.524
Put your hands on the floor.

59:34.526 --> 59:35.392
What the fuck is goin' on?

59:35.394 --> 59:36.993
You talk to much, shut up.

59:36.995 --> 59:37.995
Hands on the floor.

59:37.997 --> 59:39.964
Hank, you fuckin'...

59:39.966 --> 59:41.935
You fucked me Hank.

59:43.202 --> 59:46.971
I have a message
and I'm more excited

59:46.973 --> 59:50.175
about givin' it to you today

59:50.177 --> 59:52.880
than anything I've ever
done in my life.

59:53.346 --> 59:55.850
(mumbles)

01:00:00.453 --> 01:00:03.087
We'll use the rugs.

01:00:03.089 --> 01:00:05.158
(mumbles)

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:16.137
(mumbles)

01:00:17.972 --> 01:00:22.844
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up.

01:00:24.713 --> 01:00:30.619
I had a good job, a father,
good husband.

01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:33.353
I'll blow your fuckin' head
off right now.

01:00:33.355 --> 01:00:35.859
Shut your fuckin' mouth.

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:40.462
Pull the trigger.

01:00:41.696 --> 01:00:45.732
(muffled screaming)

01:00:45.734 --> 01:00:49.104
All this stuff,
it's stoppin' you?

01:00:54.275 --> 01:00:56.178
Attack it.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.378
Do it.

01:00:58.380 --> 01:00:59.514
And everyday,
that's how I started off.

01:00:59.516 --> 01:01:02.684
How can I do this?
Give me the power.

01:01:02.686 --> 01:01:04.486
Give me the power.

01:01:04.488 --> 01:01:05.753
That's what you've got to do.

01:01:05.755 --> 01:01:08.590
You got to get that thing,
it's the drinkin'.

01:01:08.592 --> 01:01:09.557
It's about anything that's

01:01:09.559 --> 01:01:12.059
stoppin' you from
doing your job.

01:01:12.061 --> 01:01:15.764
And you gotta wrestle it,
you gotta take it down

01:01:15.766 --> 01:01:17.564
to the floor and you gotta
rip it apart.

01:01:17.566 --> 01:01:23.739
I gave my will and my life
over to a greater force,

01:01:23.741 --> 01:01:26.174
to a power that surged
through me

01:01:26.176 --> 01:01:28.710
when I realized I could be
the instrument

01:01:28.712 --> 01:01:30.915
of my own deliverance.

01:01:47.498 --> 01:01:50.335
(grunting)

01:01:58.409 --> 01:02:02.414
(muffled screaming)

01:02:18.098 --> 01:02:20.200
Where the fuck where you?

01:02:21.868 --> 01:02:24.502
Fuck you.

01:02:24.504 --> 01:02:26.306
Just calm down.

01:02:27.307 --> 01:02:29.475
You tied him up.

01:02:31.678 --> 01:02:33.112
All right, all right.

01:02:33.114 --> 01:02:34.146
The fuck.

01:02:34.148 --> 01:02:35.813
Nothin's changed.

01:02:35.815 --> 01:02:39.052
Nothin's fuckin' changed.

01:02:43.224 --> 01:02:45.657
(muffled screaming)

01:02:45.659 --> 01:02:47.528
It's your fuckin' fault.

01:02:48.462 --> 01:02:50.297
God damn it!

01:02:52.766 --> 01:02:55.369
Come on, do it! Do it.

01:02:56.338 --> 01:02:58.540
Do it!

01:03:04.546 --> 01:03:07.680
He's gonna kill us both now.

01:03:07.682 --> 01:03:09.816
Just pull the fuckin' trigger.

01:03:09.818 --> 01:03:15.488
You have some money
stashed away right?

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:16.856
When your friend over here
wakes up

01:03:16.858 --> 01:03:18.256
I'm going to let him go.

01:03:18.258 --> 01:03:22.262
He's got an hour to come back
with a hundred grand.

01:03:22.264 --> 01:03:23.331
If not you end up at the bottom

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:24.831
of the fuckin' lake,
you hear me?

01:03:24.833 --> 01:03:26.666
What the hell is this?

01:03:26.668 --> 01:03:27.902
That's not the deal.

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:33.373
I'm changing the fuckin' deal.

01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:36.210
You want to save your son
or not?

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:38.913
Are you threatening me?

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:42.616
I'm just saying,
are you fuckin' threatening me?

01:03:42.618 --> 01:03:45.655
(muffled sounds)

01:03:52.863 --> 01:03:55.363
Why the fuck you doin' this?

01:03:55.365 --> 01:03:57.598
I lent this prick some money,
you know?

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:01.368
And now I'm trying to collect,
I mean what's wrong with that?

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:03.370
It's your method
of collection.

01:04:03.372 --> 01:04:05.740
What are you talkin' about?

01:04:05.742 --> 01:04:07.809
What the fuck am
I talking about?

01:04:07.811 --> 01:04:09.344
Huh, you want me to show you?

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:10.913
Show me, show me what?

01:04:10.915 --> 01:04:12.480
You want me to
fuckin' show you?

01:04:12.482 --> 01:04:14.849
Help! Help!

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:17.520
Wait, wait. (indistinct).

01:04:17.522 --> 01:04:20.625
(muffled screams)

01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:27.599
Here's the fucking deal.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.703
You fucking ready tough guy?

01:04:35.974 --> 01:04:38.643
(muffled screaming)

01:05:34.068 --> 01:05:36.638
Finish him off.

01:06:10.005 --> 01:06:12.641
You're going to tell me right?

01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:19.281
Yeah, I swear.

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:40.604
Swear on the life
of your daughter.

01:06:45.441 --> 01:06:49.312
I swear on my daughter's life.

01:07:04.661 --> 01:07:08.532
(muffled crying)

01:07:23.883 --> 01:07:26.819
(muffled laughing)

01:07:29.854 --> 01:07:32.425
Stop your fuckin' laughin'.

01:07:33.792 --> 01:07:35.595
Stop it!

01:07:36.428 --> 01:07:38.764
(muffled talking)

01:07:47.908 --> 01:07:50.710
Stop it!

01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:58.851
Stop it.

01:07:59.752 --> 01:08:01.921
(muffled laughing)

01:08:08.729 --> 01:08:12.801
I said stop it!

01:08:13.733 --> 01:08:16.371
(grunting)

01:09:02.184 --> 01:09:06.689
(gasping)

01:09:30.014 --> 01:09:38.488
You'd do all that for
your son, to protect him?

01:09:44.095 --> 01:09:47.029
I talked to Gina, your ex.

01:09:47.032 --> 01:09:48.231
You're a good mom.

01:09:48.233 --> 01:09:49.365
Thank you Hank.

01:09:49.367 --> 01:09:55.071
Gina, why were you
talking to Gina?

01:09:55.073 --> 01:10:00.242
She told me that there was
one thing that you loved

01:10:00.244 --> 01:10:04.914
more than anything in the world.

01:10:04.916 --> 01:10:06.715
Your boy.

01:10:06.717 --> 01:10:12.889
I wasn't so sure, I mean,
a kid you'd never seen.

01:10:12.891 --> 01:10:14.090
What about Johnny?

01:10:14.092 --> 01:10:16.260
I talked to Johnny
on the phone today.

01:10:16.262 --> 01:10:18.996
No one is threatening him.

01:10:18.998 --> 01:10:22.866
Malvin, I paid him a couple
of cartons of smokes

01:10:22.868 --> 01:10:24.602
and a few pills.

01:10:24.604 --> 01:10:26.603
I set all that up.

01:10:26.605 --> 01:10:27.904
What the fuck is
going on Hank?

01:10:27.906 --> 01:10:33.278
He didn't break my fingers,
my hand's fine.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:38.015
The real bonus was
you lead me right to Mike.

01:10:38.017 --> 01:10:41.554
You introduced me.

01:10:44.023 --> 01:10:45.390
What about Mike?

01:10:45.392 --> 01:10:49.927
About Mike?

01:10:49.929 --> 01:10:54.666
I made sure that Mike
saw his wife die

01:10:54.668 --> 01:10:57.035
just before I put a bullet
in his head.

01:10:57.037 --> 01:10:59.004
(gunshot)

01:10:59.006 --> 01:11:03.042
Mike, my good pal, Mike.

01:11:03.044 --> 01:11:06.982
(gunshot)
(screaming)

01:11:22.965 --> 01:11:27.970
Charlie? Charlie?

01:11:31.407 --> 01:11:34.143
Don't you die on me.

01:11:36.211 --> 01:11:39.148
Who the fuck are you?

01:11:39.715 --> 01:11:41.414
I got to tell you a story.

01:11:41.416 --> 01:11:45.922
You stay with me.
You stay with me!

01:11:48.824 --> 01:11:50.793
Good.

01:11:51.226 --> 01:11:54.864
I'm going to tell my story now.

01:11:55.699 --> 01:12:01.835
Once upon a time,
there was a man,

01:12:01.837 --> 01:12:09.243
a man who loved his wife
and his six-year-old daughter,

01:12:09.245 --> 01:12:14.382
very, very much.

01:12:14.384 --> 01:12:20.488
One Fourth of July
there was fireworks in the park.

01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:22.858
But the man couldn't
take his family,

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.292
he had a shift at work, see?

01:12:24.294 --> 01:12:29.363
So he called his wife
and told her

01:12:29.365 --> 01:12:33.269
she should go without him.

01:12:33.271 --> 01:12:39.275
It'd be somethin' special.

01:12:39.277 --> 01:12:44.213
I mean that's
somethin' bad.

01:12:44.215 --> 01:12:51.889
Really, really bad happened.

01:13:02.434 --> 01:13:06.369
(muffled voices)

01:13:06.371 --> 01:13:09.642
(indistinct) kids.

01:13:11.443 --> 01:13:15.080
Yeah Charlie.

01:13:24.423 --> 01:13:28.796
Yeah, yeah I am.

01:13:33.065 --> 01:13:40.273
This is Catherine
and my Charlotte.

01:13:45.213 --> 01:13:48.014
It was my job to protect them,

01:13:48.016 --> 01:13:53.722
but you and Mike took
that away from me.

01:13:56.123 --> 01:14:00.292
I served my time,
20 fuckin' years.

01:14:00.294 --> 01:14:02.495
Twenty years?

01:14:02.497 --> 01:14:07.769
You killed my family!

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.975
Now,

01:14:15.977 --> 01:14:20.213
Gina said somethin'
about a big scar.

01:14:20.215 --> 01:14:23.850
It was all your fault.

01:14:23.852 --> 01:14:27.386
Charlie? Good.

01:14:27.388 --> 01:14:30.793
Good, you remember.

01:14:36.366 --> 01:14:38.533
Why don't you check.

01:14:38.535 --> 01:14:40.267
Check what?

01:14:40.269 --> 01:14:41.970
Come on Charlie,

01:14:41.972 --> 01:14:46.975
you think Shyboy was named
that from birth?

01:14:46.977 --> 01:14:49.947
Johnny was a much better name.

01:15:03.461 --> 01:15:06.898
(gasping)

01:15:28.252 --> 01:15:30.321
No!

01:15:31.323 --> 01:15:36.292
No!

01:15:36.294 --> 01:15:38.096
No!

01:15:47.673 --> 01:15:51.011
(panting)

01:16:12.198 --> 01:16:17.304
You didn't protect him,
did ya'?

01:16:22.643 --> 01:16:27.381
You feel what I feel, Johnny?

01:16:29.383 --> 01:16:32.920
You're feeling it now.

01:16:39.193 --> 01:16:41.429
I found you.

01:16:50.705 --> 01:16:55.077
Sir, sir, hi,
is Charlie Sundstrom here?

01:16:56.011 --> 01:17:00.280
Charlie Sundstrom ain't
here no more.

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:03.586
What happened?
You know where he is?

01:17:04.185 --> 01:17:07.923
He ain't here, he's gone.

01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:39.088
(yelling)

01:18:05.316 --> 01:18:07.952
(gunshots)

01:18:09.822 --> 01:18:12.489
I'm going to
give you somethin',

01:18:12.491 --> 01:18:15.225
because I care about all of you.

01:18:15.227 --> 01:18:19.596
You're beautiful people
and I appreciate the struggles,

01:18:19.598 --> 01:18:26.168
the struggles I've seen,
and the honesty I've seen,

01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:30.574
because it's rare to see it
in this world, let me tell ya.

01:18:30.576 --> 01:18:33.510
I want to give you somethin'
because you deserve it.

01:18:33.512 --> 01:18:39.249
Each one of you is a
loving, respected human being.

01:18:39.251 --> 01:18:43.788
You're gonna find a way
to take that out into the world,

01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:49.826
where everybody feels that.

01:18:49.828 --> 01:18:56.602
I'm a human, hey, I belong,
I can be loved.

01:18:56.604 --> 01:19:01.139
Another way to salvation?
Maybe.

01:19:01.141 --> 01:19:06.777
How about just being able
to get up in the morning,

01:19:06.779 --> 01:19:10.682
drink your coffee
and read the paper

01:19:10.684 --> 01:19:14.154
without letting rage blind you.

01:19:18.458 --> 01:19:22.327
Here's the thing
I want to tell ya.

01:19:22.329 --> 01:19:27.934
You choose, you control
the anxiety,

01:19:27.936 --> 01:19:30.369
the guilt, the fear,
whatever it is.

01:19:30.371 --> 01:19:35.207
You control when that stops yo,
or you send it away,

01:19:35.209 --> 01:19:37.743
and you find that beautiful,

01:19:37.745 --> 01:19:43.516
positive thing you're
going towards.

01:19:43.518 --> 01:19:46.655
And you go there.

01:19:49.592 --> 01:19:52.195
Do you hear me?
