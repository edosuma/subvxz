37:40.358 --> 37:43.160
{\an8}At first, when Sky call me about
being in this fashion show,

37:43.227 --> 37:45.196
{\an8}I'm like, "Why in the world
would I wanna be

37:45.262 --> 37:47.098

as Ceaser's dumbass?"

37:47.164 --> 37:48.699

"I can shake my ass in Ceaser's
bitch-ass face, and taunt him

37:52.470 --> 37:54.972
