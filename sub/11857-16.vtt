WEBVTT

00:17.500 --> 00:21.333
I forgot to pack my flannel
PJs
and my rabbit hair slippers.

00:21.417 --> 00:23.208
Maybe I can bring
them to her, Bill.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.000
We talked about this. No visits.

00:30.500 --> 00:31.917
I gotta use the kybo.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.792
- What did she say?
- She needs the bathroom.

00:34.875 --> 00:36.083
You'll have to hold it.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.542
'And speak English, Hilary.'

00:38.625 --> 00:40.583
If I could take
it back, I would.

00:40.667 --> 00:44.166
It's just...no one told us
it could happen, you know?

00:44.250 --> 00:45.709
Let's not talk about it, honey.

00:45.792 --> 00:48.750
- Please?
- I'm sorry, mom.

00:58.875 --> 01:01.125
Here we are.

01:01.208 --> 01:05.458
(Patricia)
'Oh, looks even prettier
than the brochure.'

01:05.542 --> 01:07.792
I'm sure everyone
will be very nice.

01:19.083 --> 01:21.500
Please don't leave me here.

01:21.583 --> 01:23.834
I'll make sure no one sees me
at home, Daddy, I swear.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.917
- Patricia.
- Come on, Hilary.

01:41.750 --> 01:44.500
- Huck said he'd marry me.
- Huck's a child. So are you.

01:44.583 --> 01:46.166
Yeah. But it's our baby.

01:46.250 --> 01:48.917
Do you have any idea
what it's like to raise a
child?

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Now, please, Hilary,
I know what's best.

01:53.959 --> 01:56.417
- So you'll visit me, mom?
- We'll see, sweetheart.

01:56.500 --> 02:00.333
- Get in the car, Patricia.
- You're not coming in?

02:00.417 --> 02:02.208
She's never spent a night
away from home, Bill.

02:02.291 --> 02:04.500
And if you'd watched her
better
she wouldn't be in this mess

02:04.583 --> 02:06.875
in the first place.

02:09.792 --> 02:11.917
Please don't leave me here.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.000
Mommy?

03:17.583 --> 03:20.834
(Barbara)
My mom passed away
two months ago.

03:20.917 --> 03:23.500
She was a great mother, but..

03:23.583 --> 03:27.417
...I found this
in her belongings.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.417
(Lilly)
'Mm.'

03:29.500 --> 03:32.959
- Your birth certificate?
- My original birth
certificate.

03:33.041 --> 03:37.083
I never knew,
but...I was adopted.

03:37.166 --> 03:39.792
You know we deal in homicides,
right, Ms. Lakey?

03:39.875 --> 03:42.083
I tracked down
my real mother.

03:42.166 --> 03:44.750
She was murdered
the day after I was born.

03:44.834 --> 03:46.250
Her name was Hilary West.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.625
She was 17 years old.

03:48.709 --> 03:50.125
(Lilly)
Never found the doer.

03:50.208 --> 03:54.959
I was hoping if you did,
you might be able to tell me..

03:55.041 --> 03:56.834
- Why she gave you up?
- Yes.

03:56.917 --> 03:58.417
Well, your mom was 17.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.291
Probably couldn't raise you
the way she wanted.

04:00.375 --> 04:01.959
I have-I have
a nine-year-old son.

04:02.041 --> 04:04.125
I can't even fathom
doing something like that.

04:04.208 --> 04:07.250
Yeah. But times were different.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.458
Are you close with your mother?

04:12.792 --> 04:16.458
Uh, people shouldn't have kids
till they're ready.

04:16.542 --> 04:18.291
Sounds like your mother wasn't.

04:18.375 --> 04:20.417
Still, I'd like to know.

04:24.208 --> 04:25.500
(Lilly)
Well, this is from uh..

04:25.583 --> 04:27.417
...St. Mary's Home
for Unwed Mothers.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.000
Where she gave birth.

04:29.083 --> 04:31.417
There's no mention of
St. Mary's in the
article.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.333
Maybe they were keeping
it out of the press?

04:33.417 --> 04:35.959
- No. Maybe they didn't know.
- How's that possible?

04:36.041 --> 04:38.208
She was there
right before she died.

04:39.959 --> 04:42.667
(Lilly)
Or it could be someone
was keeping it secret.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.667
Who?

04:44.750 --> 04:47.667
Someone with a secret
of their own.

05:21.166 --> 05:23.875
Hilary West.
Blunt force trauma to the
head.

05:23.959 --> 05:25.250
Weapon never found.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.417
Autopsy didn't pick up
the recent pregnancy?

05:27.500 --> 05:29.125
No, back then, only did
a cursory check

05:29.208 --> 05:30.375
for sexual assault.

05:30.458 --> 05:32.250
Field where she
was killed was a mile

05:32.333 --> 05:33.917
from St. Mary's.

05:34.041 --> 05:36.250
No wonder the cops back then
didn't put her there.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.375
St. Mary's
closed in '74.

05:38.458 --> 05:40.125
Checking on who might
still be around.

05:40.208 --> 05:42.417
Parents said they'd been
keeping
Hilary home from school

05:42.500 --> 05:43.959
to recover from mono.

05:44.041 --> 05:46.041
They claimed she snuck out
in the middle of the night.

05:46.125 --> 05:47.959
No idea where she was going.

05:48.041 --> 05:50.250
Pretty elaborate lie
to cover up a pregnancy.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.417
Well, daughter getting
pregnant out of wedlock..

05:52.500 --> 05:54.083
...real stigma
for a family back then.

05:54.166 --> 05:55.500
Worse than murder?

05:55.583 --> 05:57.375
A few girls in
my high school "went away."

05:57.458 --> 05:58.917
We all knew the reason why.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.959
Abortion's illegal, and no
single mothers back then.

06:02.041 --> 06:03.417
And no sex ed either.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.875
Couldn't buy birth control
unless you were married.

06:05.959 --> 06:08.250
Abstinence was the answer.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.375
- That always works.
- 'Everyone was doing it.'

06:10.458 --> 06:11.542
No one was talking about it.

06:11.625 --> 06:13.083
Lucky for me,
I had an older brother.

06:13.166 --> 06:16.166
Yeah. Who turned out
to be a priest.

06:22.417 --> 06:24.333
Could be the boyfriend.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.500
Barbara's father?

06:26.583 --> 06:29.291
If he even knew
about the pregnancy.

06:29.375 --> 06:31.291
Well, let's start with him.

06:47.041 --> 06:48.750
Yeah?

06:48.834 --> 06:51.959
Hey. Mr. Oberland around, buddy?

06:52.500 --> 06:54.500
Grandpa!

07:03.750 --> 07:05.583
Detectives Valens, Vera.

07:05.667 --> 07:09.333
Got a few questions
about a...Hilary West.

07:12.375 --> 07:14.333
Haven't heard that
name
in a long time.

07:14.417 --> 07:17.875
She was pregnant, gave birth
right before she was killed.

07:17.959 --> 07:20.333
My family is in
there.
This is sensitive.

07:20.417 --> 07:22.291
Murder tends to be.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.959
So, you knew
about the pregnancy?

07:25.041 --> 07:27.959
[sighs]
We were just
kids.
Still in high

07:28.041 --> 07:30.125
So you were the father.

07:30.208 --> 07:31.917
Hmm.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.458
Hilary told me
that she was...that
way.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.166
And you didn't think
that her being "that way"

07:37.250 --> 07:38.875
could've been helpful
to the investigation?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.875
Look, I was 17.
I didn't know what to
do.

07:41.959 --> 07:44.333
You knew about St. Mary's
Home for Unwed Mothers?

07:44.417 --> 07:47.041
I knew her parents were
planning to send her
away

07:47.125 --> 07:49.500
but I didn't know where.

07:49.583 --> 07:53.208
Then Hilary disappears, and two
months later, I hear she's dead.

07:53.291 --> 07:56.041
And you had no contact
with her after she left?

07:56.125 --> 07:59.709
- Her folks made sure of that.
- So why keep your mouth shut?

07:59.792 --> 08:01.875
Because we were good kids..

08:01.959 --> 08:03.625
...and good kids
didn't get caught.

08:07.166 --> 08:09.709
My school uniform
doesn't fit anymore.

08:09.792 --> 08:11.583
I can't keep anything down.

08:11.667 --> 08:14.875
Maybe you're just
eating too much.

08:14.959 --> 08:18.208
Huck...I'm scared.

08:18.291 --> 08:21.000
My parents are going to kill me.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.583
But it was just that one time.

08:22.667 --> 08:24.166
You told me it wouldn't
happen the first time.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.166
It's not supposed to.

08:26.250 --> 08:27.625
Right?

08:30.500 --> 08:31.709
What are we going to do?

08:34.667 --> 08:38.750
Maybe there's a way
to...get rid of it?

08:38.834 --> 08:41.458
No. Girls die.

08:46.834 --> 08:49.083
Then we'll just..

08:49.166 --> 08:51.208
...get married.

08:52.583 --> 08:54.125
We've only been going
steady two months.

08:54.208 --> 08:57.250
We get along alright.

08:57.333 --> 09:00.083
- What about Yale?
- Forget Yale.

09:00.166 --> 09:02.125
I'll never get in.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.667
Married? Are you sure?

09:07.750 --> 09:10.125
It's what
everybody
does, right?

09:10.208 --> 09:12.250
Get married.

09:14.250 --> 09:17.166
But do you love me?

09:17.250 --> 09:18.458
Yeah, sure I do, Hil.

09:28.291 --> 09:31.000
I tried to do the right thing.

09:32.250 --> 09:33.959
Those wedding bells never rang.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.125
Not after Hilary's father
found out.

09:36.208 --> 09:41.000
Ain't so copacetic
about the whole thing?

09:41.083 --> 09:44.959
Let's just say that was
the end of our pipe
dream.

09:45.041 --> 09:48.250
You know, back then,
adults gave the orders.

09:48.333 --> 09:50.000
Kids listened.

09:51.375 --> 09:53.208
Thanks for your time.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.250
I don't even know
if it was a girl or boy.

10:01.333 --> 10:03.542
Uh, her name's Barbara.

10:17.500 --> 10:20.083
(Lilly)
'We know you sent
Hilary to St. Mary's.'

10:20.166 --> 10:22.125
I thought I was doing
what was best.

10:22.208 --> 10:25.041
By not helping solve
your daughter's murder?

10:25.125 --> 10:27.875
It was Bill's idea
to keep quiet about St.
Mary's.

10:27.959 --> 10:29.166
And you just
went
along with it?

10:29.250 --> 10:31.542
He was my husband.
I didn't have a choice.

10:31.625 --> 10:34.959
Till the day he died,
we never discussed it again.

10:35.041 --> 10:36.625
Instead you pretend
that it never happened.

10:36.709 --> 10:41.500
I convinced myself I was
protecting Hilary's
memory.

10:41.583 --> 10:44.208
Better than people
thinking her cheap.

10:44.291 --> 10:47.792
So giving the baby away
was...the only real option?

10:47.875 --> 10:51.667
Nothing more important than
what the neighbors think,
right?

10:51.750 --> 10:53.583
Talk about St. Mary's.

10:53.667 --> 10:56.375
I visited once when Bill
was away on business.

10:56.458 --> 10:59.583
Brought the rabbit hair
slippers
she loved so much.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.000
What happened?

11:01.083 --> 11:03.250
Well, I thought we sent her
to the right place..

11:03.333 --> 11:05.083
...but I was wrong.

11:30.375 --> 11:33.834
(Hilary)
'I heard we only get 15
minutes
to say goodbye to our babies.'

11:33.917 --> 11:35.417
(female #1)
'I only need one minute.'

11:35.500 --> 11:38.667
Rob's the only reason
I'm in this prison.

11:38.750 --> 11:42.750
- I think she has the
hiccups.
- She?

11:42.834 --> 11:45.250
You're crazier than I thought.

11:45.333 --> 11:49.250
It's kind of nice, a little
person growing inside, you
know?

11:49.333 --> 11:52.417
Yeah, sucking your blood,
scarfing your food.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.417
The sooner it comes out,
the better.

11:56.750 --> 12:00.041
[sighs]
Dr. Frankenstein strikes
again.

12:00.125 --> 12:02.542
- Dr. Frankenstein?
- 'Guy's a hack.'

12:02.625 --> 12:05.291
'Bottom of the barrel. Heard
he
killed a girl during labor.'

12:09.917 --> 12:13.417
- Next patient, Hilary W.
- No.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.959
Dr. Finnegan doesn't
have time to waste.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.291
I don't want
him
to touch me.

12:17.375 --> 12:19.542
You're lucky to have him,
a girl like you.

12:19.625 --> 12:21.583
You're a nut job if you think
any of us are going to

12:21.667 --> 12:23.125
put our legs
in those torture devices.

12:23.208 --> 12:25.291
If you'd kept your legs
together in the first place

12:25.375 --> 12:27.959
you wouldn't be here.

12:28.041 --> 12:31.041
Bad things happen
to bad girls, Hilary.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.250
If you don't behave, I promise

12:33.333 --> 12:35.542
it's only going to get worse.

12:57.041 --> 13:01.166
A day doesn't go by
I don't beg for forgiveness.

13:01.250 --> 13:05.375
Leaving my little girl
in that place.

13:05.458 --> 13:09.083
Give us a call,
anything
else comes to mind.

13:17.917 --> 13:21.458
How is the baby?

13:21.542 --> 13:24.625
Um, she's a grown woman now.

13:28.917 --> 13:33.625
Will you tell her...
that she has a grandmother?

13:37.667 --> 13:40.875
Sounds like this Dr. Finnegan
was a real butcher.

13:40.959 --> 13:42.959
Girls dying on the table.

13:43.041 --> 13:45.709
Maybe Hilary was one of them.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.917
And St. Mary's covered it up.

13:57.375 --> 13:59.000
You find this Dr. Finnegan?

13:59.083 --> 14:00.959
Loser bit the dust in '75.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.667
- Cirrhosis of the liver.
- Serious drinker?

14:03.750 --> 14:05.750
Six women bled to death
on his delivery table

14:05.834 --> 14:07.500
between '61 and '68.

14:07.583 --> 14:09.750
Scumbag finally lost
his medical license.

14:09.834 --> 14:12.625
Took six deaths for the
medical
board to yank his license?

14:12.709 --> 14:14.125
"Doctor knows best."

14:14.208 --> 14:17.041
Glad I was an unwed mother
in the '90s not the '60s.

14:17.125 --> 14:18.625
What about this nun
who ran St. Mary's?

14:18.709 --> 14:20.375
Saint Margaret's
still alive and kicking

14:20.458 --> 14:22.417
in a convent
retirement community.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.959
A community of retired nuns?
Sounds like a par-tay.

14:26.041 --> 14:28.583
If girls were dying at
St. Mary's, it'd be on her
head.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.792
Giving her motive
to keep it hush-hush.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.417
Keep thinking one of them
is going to jump out

14:38.500 --> 14:42.041
and thwack my hand
with a ruler.

14:42.125 --> 14:45.291
Back at St. Francis...
we got the yardstick.

14:46.458 --> 14:47.542
Sister Margaret?

14:51.542 --> 14:54.125
- Yes?
- Detectives Valens, Vera.

14:54.208 --> 14:55.750
Philly Homicide.

14:55.834 --> 14:58.667
It's about St. Mary's.

14:58.750 --> 15:00.291
That was a long time ago.

15:00.375 --> 15:02.542
And Hilary West's murder.

15:02.625 --> 15:05.792
Like I said...
a long time ago.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.291
Wondering why you never came
forward when she was killed?

15:08.375 --> 15:10.834
Well, the
detectives
never came to us.

15:10.917 --> 15:13.959
- And I never lied to
anybody.
- 'Well, by omission.'

15:14.041 --> 15:15.333
You knew the truth.

15:15.417 --> 15:18.083
I couldn't jeopardize
our reputation.

15:18.166 --> 15:21.250
We were the last place
those girls could go.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.792
Maybe you remember the quack
you hired to work there.

15:23.875 --> 15:25.000
Dr. Finnegan?

15:25.083 --> 15:27.917
Well, we didn't have
a lot of resources.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.333
His, um...price
tag
fit our budget.

15:32.417 --> 15:34.000
You get what you pay for, right?

15:34.083 --> 15:37.333
Well, so maybe he kills
Hilary
and you dump her in a field?

15:37.417 --> 15:39.542
That's a ridiculous accusation.

15:39.625 --> 15:42.041
That hack lost
his medical license.

15:42.125 --> 15:44.417
Women were dying while he
was three sheets to the wind.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.667
Well, I'm sorry to hear
that,
but you must understand

15:47.750 --> 15:52.083
that society had rejected
those girls.

15:52.166 --> 15:54.000
You saying beggars
can't be choosers?

15:54.083 --> 15:58.333
I'm saying a houseful
of pregnant teenagers..

15:58.417 --> 16:01.542
There was a reason that
they called them "bad girls."

16:05.333 --> 16:10.000
Wedding bands go on
the left ring finger, girls.

16:10.083 --> 16:13.709
No need for anyone in town
to know your predicament.

16:13.792 --> 16:17.208
- Thank you, Sister Margaret.
- "Thank you, Sister
Margaret."

16:17.291 --> 16:20.041
I'll just put
these away.

16:20.125 --> 16:23.458
Always gotta be
a kiss-up in the bunch.

16:23.542 --> 16:26.291
Soon I'm going to
have a real one.

16:26.375 --> 16:28.083
That why you're being
a good girl?

16:28.166 --> 16:29.834
So Huck will marry you?

16:29.917 --> 16:31.709
He needs a little
more
time to tell his
parents.

16:31.792 --> 16:32.959
But once he sees the baby--

16:33.041 --> 16:35.917
You live on a street
called "Denial."

16:36.000 --> 16:39.792
You haven't heard a peep outta
that cat since you've been
here.

16:39.875 --> 16:42.250
He's busy with final exams.

16:42.333 --> 16:43.583
Forget about him.

16:43.667 --> 16:47.417
And forget about
your little sunshine, too.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.500
He's going to marry me, Karen.

16:51.208 --> 16:53.834
He promised.

16:53.917 --> 16:57.500
You fat cows get knocked
up
at the submarine races?

16:57.583 --> 16:59.000
Moo!

16:59.083 --> 17:01.000
(kid #1)
'You sweathogs are so easy'

17:01.083 --> 17:04.166
any old dude
could score with you!

17:04.250 --> 17:07.917
Think you're tough? Nothin'
but a bunch of pantywaists!

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
Hilary, think fast. Aim for
the runt with the duck butt!

17:12.083 --> 17:13.542
Throw it, spazo!

17:13.625 --> 17:16.333
Oh, you're worse
than I thought. Oh!

17:16.417 --> 17:17.291
Ow!

17:17.375 --> 17:20.041
Oh, candyass! You better run!

17:23.792 --> 17:25.125
Who's responsible for this?

17:25.208 --> 17:27.667
Those hoods called us sluts!
They deserved it!

17:27.750 --> 17:29.458
I said who's
responsible?

17:32.834 --> 17:34.083
At least one of you
has learned her lesson.

17:34.166 --> 17:36.583
Ow! Get off of me,
you ugly bitch!

17:36.667 --> 17:37.875
You're going to
the isolation
room.

17:37.959 --> 17:42.041
- No!
- Sister Abigail!

17:43.875 --> 17:45.959
You're gonna pay, good girl.

17:48.583 --> 17:51.709
Karen Watson was a hellion.

17:51.792 --> 17:54.291
Uncontrollable.

17:54.375 --> 17:56.375
She and Hilary
butt heads
again?

17:56.458 --> 17:59.625
All I know is that
before Karen came to us

17:59.709 --> 18:02.333
she was expelled
from her high school.

18:02.417 --> 18:03.625
Expelled for what?

18:03.709 --> 18:06.500
For hitting another
girl
in the head..

18:06.583 --> 18:08.500
...with a rock.

18:19.709 --> 18:25.041
Heard you got
a real temper, Karen.

18:25.125 --> 18:28.166
Take it you're not going to
order the blue plate special?

18:28.250 --> 18:31.583
Detectives Jeffries,
Rush. Homicide.

18:31.667 --> 18:34.333
Hey, blame the cook.
I'm...just the
messenger.

18:34.417 --> 18:38.000
Hilary West, St. Mary's
home.
That jog any memories?

18:38.083 --> 18:39.500
Maybe you knocked
her out, too?

18:39.583 --> 18:41.834
Like you did your
high school classmate.

18:41.917 --> 18:44.750
Yeah, and that
harlot
had it coming.

18:44.834 --> 18:47.208
What about Hilary?
She have it coming,
too?

18:47.291 --> 18:51.208
[sighs]
Hilary was harmless.

18:51.291 --> 18:53.041
Goofball actually grew on me.

18:53.125 --> 18:54.709
Where were you
the night she was killed?

18:54.792 --> 18:58.375
Sleeping off a
46-hour
delivery.

18:58.458 --> 19:01.208
You try pushing out
an eight-pound bowling
ball

19:01.291 --> 19:02.750
without pain killers.

19:02.834 --> 19:05.375
Didn't drag my ass
out of bed for a
week.

19:05.458 --> 19:07.083
So why didn't you tell the cops

19:07.166 --> 19:09.041
she'd been staying
at St. Mary's?

19:09.125 --> 19:12.041
Same reason I never
tried to find my
kid.

19:12.125 --> 19:14.208
Some secrets are easier to keep.

19:14.291 --> 19:15.667
Easy to find out, too.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.875
Look, lady..

19:17.959 --> 19:20.792
...all we girls had was
each other in that hellhole.

19:20.875 --> 19:24.250
- So who had it out for
Hilary?
- Who do you think?

19:24.333 --> 19:27.250
[scoffs]
Guy who got her in trouble
in the first place.

19:37.166 --> 19:38.917
Check it out!

19:39.000 --> 19:40.250
Look what I just bought!

19:40.333 --> 19:42.709
You can record yourself.

20:13.834 --> 20:17.417
What is it, Hilary?
Your water break?

20:17.500 --> 20:20.625
Huck?

20:20.709 --> 20:22.000
Hilary?

20:27.458 --> 20:31.834
I didn't know...
you'd be here.

20:35.083 --> 20:39.000
Uh, I'll meet you back
at the car, Mary Lou.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.959
Mary Lou.

20:45.041 --> 20:46.458
She's pretty.

20:46.542 --> 20:48.875
You've been gone
a long time.
And--

20:48.959 --> 20:53.208
Did you tell your parents
about the baby yet?

20:53.291 --> 20:56.083
I got into Yale.

20:56.166 --> 20:57.083
I can't get married.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.000
But you said you were going
to do the right thing.

21:01.083 --> 21:04.834
- You promised.
- We're 17, Hilary. We're
kids.

21:04.917 --> 21:08.125
Yeah, and I'm going to have one.

21:08.208 --> 21:11.041
- You have to tell them.
- I can't.

21:11.125 --> 21:15.250
If they knew about
this,
they'd kill me.

21:15.333 --> 21:16.667
Feel.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.625
Can you believe that?

21:18.709 --> 21:21.166
- She's kicking.
- Hilary, stop.

21:27.834 --> 21:29.834
What am I going to do?

21:29.917 --> 21:32.667
- Just give the baby up.
- But she's our sunshine.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.375
(Huck)
'I don't want
to be a father.'

21:35.667 --> 21:38.583
You already are.

21:38.667 --> 21:42.709
If you won't
tell your parents...I will.

21:42.792 --> 21:44.959
What?

21:45.041 --> 21:46.709
You better not.

21:48.125 --> 21:50.041
Hilary!

22:02.333 --> 22:05.291
A week later, Hilary was dead.

22:07.792 --> 22:09.375
Thanks for your time.

22:12.041 --> 22:15.500
Well, maybe Huck killed Hilary
before she had a chance to
tell.

22:15.583 --> 22:17.000
And shut her
up
for good.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.333
(Vera)
'Parents wouldn't have
been too happy'

22:23.417 --> 22:25.083
about you knockin' up
that girl.

22:25.166 --> 22:29.041
Giving up Yale
for a 17-year-old bride.

22:29.125 --> 22:31.041
No, you got
it all
wrong.

22:31.125 --> 22:33.125
They would've killed you.

22:33.208 --> 22:34.291
Your words.

22:34.375 --> 22:36.000
So you stopped her
before she told.

22:36.083 --> 22:37.959
I didn't kill Hilary.

22:38.041 --> 22:40.458
- That's original.
- We made a baby together.

22:40.542 --> 22:41.750
A child.

22:41.834 --> 22:44.250
Even back then, I knew
that meant something.

22:44.333 --> 22:47.208
Yeah? So why'd you lie
about seeing her again?

22:47.291 --> 22:50.250
Where were you
the night she was killed?

22:50.333 --> 22:53.750
[sighs]
With Mary-Lou McLaren.

22:53.834 --> 22:56.000
(Vera)
'That cheerleader
you started boffing'

22:56.083 --> 22:57.458
the minute Hilary
was shipped off?

22:57.542 --> 22:59.959
We were at a movie.

23:00.041 --> 23:03.500
Frankie Avalon, Annette
Funicello. "Bikini
Beach."

23:03.583 --> 23:05.333
You're a real
door prize, Huck.

23:05.417 --> 23:09.625
Look, I know...
I abandoned
Hilary.

23:09.709 --> 23:12.458
If I'd been a better
guy,
maybe she'd still be
alive.

23:12.542 --> 23:17.291
What about her threat
to tell your parents?

23:17.375 --> 23:19.417
She never did.

23:19.500 --> 23:23.083
- Saying she just forgot?
- Saying I told her mother.

23:23.166 --> 23:24.667
Mrs. West?

23:24.750 --> 23:26.500
What exactly
did you tell her?

23:27.709 --> 23:30.333
That Hilary was
planning
to keep the baby.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.333
She hit the roof.

23:33.417 --> 23:35.250
(Jeffries)
'That right?'

23:35.333 --> 23:36.792
Yeah.

23:36.875 --> 23:39.625
Said she'd go to St. Mary's..

23:39.709 --> 23:42.083
...set Hilary straight.

23:44.125 --> 23:46.542
It was bad enough
Hilary gets pregnant.

23:46.625 --> 23:49.333
Now she's determined
to keep the kid.

23:49.417 --> 23:52.000
Didn't sit well with you,
according to her boyfriend.

23:52.083 --> 23:53.834
I didn't kill
my daughter!

23:53.917 --> 23:55.250
The rabbit-hair slippers..

23:55.333 --> 23:57.125
...wasn't the last time
you saw her, was it?

23:57.208 --> 23:59.458
I loved her more than
anything in the world.

23:59.542 --> 24:02.667
That's what they all say!

24:02.750 --> 24:05.375
Well, I just couldn't let her
life turn out the way mine
did.

24:05.458 --> 24:08.875
Oh, yeah? How's that work?

24:08.959 --> 24:11.750
I dropped out of
college
to get married.

24:11.834 --> 24:14.542
Six months
later,
I had Hilary..

24:14.625 --> 24:16.375
...and that was
the end of me.

24:16.458 --> 24:18.667
Having a kid
ended your life?

24:18.750 --> 24:21.041
Being married
to one did.

24:21.125 --> 24:22.667
Bill wouldn't
let me get a
job.

24:22.750 --> 24:26.542
Turned me into his
cook,
his laundry girl.

24:26.625 --> 24:28.875
I wanted Hilary
to be more than
that..

24:28.959 --> 24:31.041
...the way I was more than that.

24:31.125 --> 24:33.709
And when Hilary
wouldn't give up the baby?

24:36.625 --> 24:39.417
She never had a choice.

24:43.291 --> 24:46.834
Mom...what are you doing here?

24:46.917 --> 24:48.333
Today's an important day.

24:48.417 --> 24:51.542
Sister Margaret has some
paperwork for you to
sign.

24:57.959 --> 25:00.417
- To give up the baby?
- Yes, Hilary.

25:06.166 --> 25:07.917
I don't want to.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.917
(Patricia)
'Huck doesn't want
to marry you, Hilary.'

25:10.000 --> 25:11.166
You can't raise
a child on your own.

25:11.250 --> 25:13.041
You are just a child yourself.

25:13.125 --> 25:16.750
Adoption will save you and the
baby from a lifetime of shame.

25:16.834 --> 25:19.041
(Patricia)
'You don't want people
calling
the baby a bastard, do you?'

25:19.125 --> 25:21.417
(Margaret)
'No man will ever marry you
if he knows what you've done.'

25:21.500 --> 25:24.250
I know you want a nice family
someday. Don't you, Hilary?

25:36.333 --> 25:38.291
On one side, I want you to write

25:38.375 --> 25:41.250
what an adoptive family
can offer the baby.

25:48.959 --> 25:51.125
Father.

25:51.208 --> 25:53.625
House.

25:53.709 --> 25:55.667
Job.

25:55.750 --> 25:58.625
Clothes.

25:58.709 --> 26:00.583
- Food.
- 'Excellent.'

26:01.792 --> 26:03.792
On the other side,
I want you to write

26:03.875 --> 26:05.083
what you can offer the baby.

26:21.125 --> 26:24.875
What did you put on your side?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.458
(Hilary)
'That's all I have.'

26:27.542 --> 26:29.208
'Love.'

26:32.750 --> 26:36.041
There is still
so much ahead of you.

26:36.125 --> 26:37.709
College.

26:37.792 --> 26:39.875
Marriage, a family.

26:42.291 --> 26:45.000
Trust me, sweetheart.

26:45.083 --> 26:47.291
Please.

26:59.333 --> 27:01.333
I'm going to make
a tape for her..

27:01.417 --> 27:03.041
...with my new
tape recorder.

27:03.125 --> 27:04.500
Her?

27:04.583 --> 27:06.834
The baby. Sunshine.

27:09.792 --> 27:13.917
- I want her to hear my
voice.
- Of course you do.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.333
At least now I'll get
a chance to tell her.

27:16.417 --> 27:19.792
Tell her what, sweetheart?

27:19.875 --> 27:21.667
Goodbye.

27:29.583 --> 27:33.083
Surrender documents are the
only
legal contracts in America

27:33.166 --> 27:36.542
that can be signed by a minor.

27:36.625 --> 27:39.625
- Doesn't seem fair.
- I was her mother.

27:39.709 --> 27:43.875
If anyone should've protected
her, it was me.

27:43.959 --> 27:47.417
Uh, what happened with the tape
Hilary made for her baby?

27:47.500 --> 27:50.458
I tried to listen to it.

27:50.542 --> 27:54.333
Cried for a week.

27:54.417 --> 27:57.667
- Still got it?
- It's all I have left of
her.

28:00.333 --> 28:02.750
Would you give it to
Barbara
when you're done?

28:05.500 --> 28:08.083
And tell her I'm sorry.

28:20.667 --> 28:22.917
Hilary's goodbye tape
to her kid.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.917
Heartbreaking stuff.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.375
Well, it's tough
to give up a
child.

28:27.458 --> 28:29.917
Especially when you're
falling in love with her.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.291
I can't even imagine it.

28:32.375 --> 28:34.291
Uh, Hilary recorded
everything that went on

28:34.375 --> 28:35.875
that last week before she died.

28:35.959 --> 28:38.291
- Anything relevant?
- The last entry might be.

28:38.375 --> 28:39.917
Night Karen had her kid..

28:40.000 --> 28:43.500
...Hilary found out what was
really going on at St.
Mary's.

28:47.458 --> 28:49.333
(Hilary on tape)
'Dear Sunshine.'

28:49.417 --> 28:51.458
'Tonight Karen had her baby.'

28:51.542 --> 28:53.959
'A beautiful little boy.'

28:54.041 --> 28:57.208
'But then she had
to say goodbye.'

29:02.041 --> 29:06.250
I used all my 15 minutes
to say goodbye to him.

29:06.333 --> 29:09.625
You're going
to be alright, Karen.

29:09.709 --> 29:12.875
It felt like less
than a second.

29:12.959 --> 29:15.000
I unwrapped him.

29:15.083 --> 29:18.875
Counted his fingers and toes.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.959
He was so perfect.

29:23.625 --> 29:26.417
The minute I saw
him
lying in his
bassinet..

29:28.667 --> 29:31.333
...I knew he belonged with me.

29:33.750 --> 29:37.834
- How could they take him away?
- Shh, shh, shh.

29:37.917 --> 29:41.291
We'll get through this, okay?

29:41.375 --> 29:43.250
It's not going to be easy..

29:43.333 --> 29:45.291
...but we'll help each other.

29:45.375 --> 29:48.333
I want him back.
I want my little boy.

29:48.417 --> 29:52.500
Sister Margaret said
it's a lawyer...and his
wife.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.875
That they're rich.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.792
They'll be a good family.

29:56.875 --> 29:59.625
They might be better parents,
but he's mine.

30:01.959 --> 30:05.041
I want him back in his bassinet.

30:05.125 --> 30:07.917
Put him back.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.166
'Put him back.'

30:09.250 --> 30:11.875
I'll take you
to your room,
Karen.

30:11.959 --> 30:14.709
Back in his bassinet.

30:38.166 --> 30:41.583
Sister Margaret was
selling the babies?

30:41.667 --> 30:44.750
We talking black market?

30:44.834 --> 30:46.917
And Hilary found out.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.417
(Stillman)
'Sister, we know
the real reason'

30:52.500 --> 30:54.083
'why you didn't tell
the police about St. Mary's.'

30:54.166 --> 30:55.709
'Cause you were sellin'
babies
to the highest bidder.

30:55.792 --> 30:57.333
And Hilary found out.

30:57.417 --> 30:59.750
You have no proof of that.

30:59.834 --> 31:02.208
Dug up your old records
at St. Mary's parish.

31:02.291 --> 31:04.750
'140 girls came through
the home on your watch.'

31:04.834 --> 31:07.208
112 official adoptions, sister.

31:07.291 --> 31:09.750
28, untraceable.

31:10.875 --> 31:12.291
I did it for the greater good.

31:12.375 --> 31:15.041
[chuckles]
Is that how you sleep at
night?

31:15.125 --> 31:17.083
It took more than
church donations

31:17.166 --> 31:18.834
to keep St. Mary's running.

31:18.917 --> 31:20.500
And those babies
went to couples

31:20.583 --> 31:22.083
who could afford
to raise them right.

31:22.166 --> 31:24.458
You mean couples who could
afford to cut in line.

31:24.542 --> 31:26.500
I never harmed
any of those girls.

31:26.583 --> 31:28.959
Isolation room,
selling their kids.

31:29.041 --> 31:30.458
You got a funny way
of defining "harm."

31:30.542 --> 31:32.166
The church told us
that they were unfit

31:32.250 --> 31:34.375
to be mothers and they'd just
go out and do it again

31:34.458 --> 31:37.709
if we didn't reform them.

31:39.291 --> 31:41.291
I had to believe that..

31:41.375 --> 31:45.041
...to do what I did.

31:45.125 --> 31:48.417
Until Hilary..

31:48.500 --> 31:50.709
...convinced me
that I was wrong.

31:53.875 --> 31:56.083
Your time is up, Hilary.

31:56.166 --> 32:00.709
- What?
- I said your time is up.

32:08.750 --> 32:11.208
I labored in the dark..

32:11.291 --> 32:14.041
...for 18 hours.

32:14.125 --> 32:18.417
No one held my hand or told me
what was happening.

32:18.500 --> 32:21.166
I thought I would die
from the pain.

32:21.250 --> 32:23.750
'I thought I
couldn't go on.'

32:23.834 --> 32:26.125
And then I saw her.

32:28.458 --> 32:30.875
And she saw me.

32:30.959 --> 32:34.000
And she knew..

32:34.083 --> 32:36.125
...I was her mother.

32:37.750 --> 32:39.834
No matter what you do..

32:39.917 --> 32:42.959
...you can never take that away.

32:43.041 --> 32:44.750
I'm her mother.

32:46.959 --> 32:49.250
I suppose a few more minutes
wouldn't hurt anyone.

32:49.333 --> 32:51.291
What you're doing here..

32:51.375 --> 32:55.333
...you lied to us
about everything.

32:55.417 --> 32:58.917
Because how could I be bad..

32:59.000 --> 33:01.458
...and make an angel like her?

33:04.000 --> 33:05.375
'Sister?'

33:07.667 --> 33:09.750
Isn't love enough?

33:16.625 --> 33:20.291
Your baby's adoptive parents
won't be here till the
morning.

33:20.375 --> 33:24.083
The nursery door
is always open.

33:24.166 --> 33:26.333
Tonight the back door
will be, too.

34:02.709 --> 34:05.000
Sometimes, when
I can't fall asleep

34:05.083 --> 34:09.500
I try to picture their faces.

34:09.583 --> 34:11.667
The girls and..

34:11.750 --> 34:13.000
'...their babies.'

34:16.542 --> 34:18.875
I ask them to forgive me.

34:21.834 --> 34:24.083
That was the last
you saw of Hilary?

34:24.166 --> 34:25.792
Yes.

34:25.875 --> 34:27.875
She left that night.

34:27.959 --> 34:30.542
So why did she leave
the baby behind?

34:30.625 --> 34:31.959
She must have been in
a real hurry

34:32.041 --> 34:35.625
because she put her
in a boy's bassinet.

34:35.709 --> 34:40.125
And that created
some confusion the next
morning.

34:40.208 --> 34:44.917
The boy's bassinet?
You remember whose?

34:45.000 --> 34:46.625
Karen Watson's.

35:04.083 --> 35:05.667
This one time, uh..

35:05.750 --> 35:08.834
...I'm six years old..

35:08.917 --> 35:11.500
...in the mall.

35:11.583 --> 35:16.000
I stare into
the toy store, and I
realize..

35:16.083 --> 35:17.834
... my mom's gone.

35:17.917 --> 35:20.875
So I go in...play with the toys

35:20.959 --> 35:23.041
till someone notices me.

35:25.083 --> 35:28.166
Calls her over the loudspeaker.

35:28.250 --> 35:30.917
And uh..

35:31.000 --> 35:33.333
...she plays it off
like she lost me

35:33.417 --> 35:36.458
'cause of the crowds.

35:36.542 --> 35:38.709
But I could smell
the booze on her breath.

35:43.125 --> 35:44.625
There a point to this?

35:44.709 --> 35:49.208
Some mothers...not really
meant to be mothers.

35:49.291 --> 35:50.792
That's why you
brought me here?

35:50.875 --> 35:52.959
Take a trip down memory lane?

35:53.041 --> 35:55.500
Oh, you don't think
about it at all?

35:55.583 --> 35:56.834
'Giving up your baby?'

35:58.834 --> 36:01.709
Did it, and it's done.

36:01.792 --> 36:03.959
It's not a big deal.

36:04.041 --> 36:06.125
Huh.

36:06.208 --> 36:08.875
A lot of people say
the worst thing that can
happen

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
is losing your kid.

36:11.083 --> 36:12.250
Probably no
different for a mother

36:12.333 --> 36:14.750
forced to give up her baby.

36:14.834 --> 36:18.625
[chuckles]
It was a piece of cake for
me.

36:18.709 --> 36:23.333
Then why wasn't
15 minutes enough?

36:23.417 --> 36:26.625
The only way
you could handle the pain

36:26.709 --> 36:30.583
was to live like
you didn't care.

36:30.667 --> 36:33.166
But I know you do.

36:33.250 --> 36:37.458
Turns out you're not the tough
girl you pretended to be.

36:37.542 --> 36:39.458
You've been looking for him
your whole life.

36:39.542 --> 36:43.667
'A member of every online
adoption search group.'

36:43.750 --> 36:46.625
You couldn't let go
of him, could you?

36:54.375 --> 36:58.834
They said it was
going
to be easy.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.208
They lied.

37:06.375 --> 37:09.959
Not a day goes by
that I don't think about
him.

37:11.542 --> 37:13.625
Pray that he's okay.

37:17.500 --> 37:20.792
Whatever mistakes
a mother makes..

37:22.375 --> 37:25.875
...nothing is stronger
than her love for her
child.

37:27.208 --> 37:29.792
No different if
she surrendered
him..

37:29.875 --> 37:32.583
...or she lost
her
in the mall.

37:45.083 --> 37:47.250
I found your son.

37:50.750 --> 37:53.417
- My son?
- He wants to meet you.

37:57.041 --> 38:00.458
You took Hilary's baby,
didn't you, Karen?

38:00.542 --> 38:04.375
You put her
in your son's bassinet.

38:04.458 --> 38:06.542
I wanted to keep her.

38:08.083 --> 38:11.000
Until I realized..

38:11.083 --> 38:14.041
...no one in the world
could replace my little boy.

38:53.083 --> 38:54.208
(Karen)
'Hilary!'

38:54.291 --> 38:57.667
Hilary, wait! It's me!

38:57.750 --> 39:00.250
What are you doing?

39:00.333 --> 39:02.417
They're selling
the babies, Karen.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.375
'Not giving them
to families.'

39:04.458 --> 39:05.917
That's not true.

39:11.625 --> 39:13.041
Hilary!

39:16.333 --> 39:18.583
Hilary, stop!

39:18.667 --> 39:20.917
They lied to us
about everything.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.917
We won't forget them.
We're mothers now.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
I'll never love anything more.

39:26.083 --> 39:29.583
But, you said
we'd help each
other.

39:29.667 --> 39:31.542
I'm sorry.

39:31.625 --> 39:33.375
- I have to go.
- Go? What?

39:33.458 --> 39:35.333
- Me and Sunshine!
- You can't just take her!

39:35.417 --> 39:36.792
It's the only way
I can keep her!

39:36.875 --> 39:39.000
I had to give up
my baby, so do you!

39:39.083 --> 39:40.709
No! She's mine.

39:44.417 --> 39:45.834
She needs to go back.

39:45.917 --> 39:48.083
You got to put
that baby back!

39:49.750 --> 39:51.291
Put him back!

39:51.375 --> 39:53.208
- What?
- Put him back!

39:53.291 --> 39:56.375
You can't take him from
me!
You can't take my baby!

39:56.458 --> 39:58.000
Karen, what are you
talking about?

39:58.083 --> 40:02.542
He's mine, not yours.
He's my baby.

40:02.625 --> 40:05.250
I want him back!

40:05.333 --> 40:08.000
I want him back!
