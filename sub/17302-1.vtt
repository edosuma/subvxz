WEBVTT

00:20.688 --> 00:23.766
(THUNDERCLAP)

00:41.125 --> 00:45.029
I've never before had the opportunity
of entertaining personages

00:45.129 --> 00:48.082
from the, er... 'dark continent'.

00:48.758 --> 00:52.870
I hope the reception was not boring
for you and your lovely wife.

00:52.970 --> 00:55.164
Quite the contrary, Count Dracula.

00:55.264 --> 00:57.083
The evening has been a splendid one,

00:57.183 --> 01:01.379
and we've found your guests
to be most impressive.

01:01.479 --> 01:04.674
I liked in particular
your Dr Duvalier.

01:04.774 --> 01:06.217
It was you who impressed him.

01:06.317 --> 01:10.763
Mamuwalde is the crystallisation
of our people's pride.

01:10.863 --> 01:13.357
My Luva... she does
me too much credit.

01:14.033 --> 01:16.769
But notwithstanding,
my people are eager

01:16.869 --> 01:19.863
to bring our ancient culture
into the community of nations.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.567
That may take a good deal of time.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.529
It will at least be time well spent,

01:26.629 --> 01:29.865
as opposed to an
exchange of banalities

01:29.965 --> 01:32.751
with pseudo-intellectuals
and dilettantes.

01:33.552 --> 01:34.745
Charming.

01:34.845 --> 01:37.456
What with dignitaries of your stature

01:37.556 --> 01:39.500
lending the weight of
your statesmanship

01:39.600 --> 01:41.836
to the fulfillment of our objectives,

01:41.936 --> 01:44.096
I believe we will succeed.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.015
Luva?

01:54.782 --> 01:59.069
To totally cease the slave trade?
I find that unrealistic.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.823
Slavery has merit, I believe.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.568
Merit?

02:05.668 --> 02:08.829
You find merit in barbarity?

02:09.170 --> 02:12.708
Barbarous from the standpoint
of the slave, perhaps.

02:13.342 --> 02:15.745
Intriguing and delightful from mine.

02:15.845 --> 02:19.923
I would pay for so beautiful an addition
to my household as your delicious wife.

02:20.224 --> 02:22.468
Sir, are you ill?

02:23.269 --> 02:26.805
Oh... I meant no insult, prince.

02:27.356 --> 02:30.134
It is a compliment for
a man of my station

02:30.234 --> 02:33.645
to look with desire on
one of your colour.

02:34.029 --> 02:37.441
Sir, I suddenly find
your cognac as...

02:38.701 --> 02:40.611
distasteful as your manner.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.822
You're behaving like some animal.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.533
- Really?
- Really.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.195
Let us not forget, sir,

02:49.295 --> 02:51.538
it is you who comes from the jungle.

02:52.590 --> 02:54.617
Our evening is finished.

02:54.717 --> 02:58.128
I bid you arouse your coachman.
We are leaving.

02:58.554 --> 03:00.547
I do not think so.

03:03.434 --> 03:04.802
How dare you!

03:13.194 --> 03:14.603
Let me go!

03:28.959 --> 03:30.202
(LAUGHS)

03:43.515 --> 03:45.884

04:32.773 --> 04:37.227
You shall pay, black prince.

04:38.153 --> 04:42.099
I shall place a curse
of suffering on you

04:42.199 --> 04:45.110
that will doom you to a living hell.

04:45.411 --> 04:47.229
A hunger,

04:47.329 --> 04:51.525
a wild, gnawing, animal hunger

04:51.625 --> 04:53.235
will grow in you,

04:53.335 --> 04:56.747
a hunger for human blood.

04:57.047 --> 05:00.951
Here you will starve for an eternity,

05:01.051 --> 05:04.330
torn by an unquenchable lust.

05:04.430 --> 05:09.210
I curse you with my name.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.720
You shall be...

05:12.980 --> 05:14.840
Blacula!

05:14.940 --> 05:18.052
A vampire like myself,

05:18.152 --> 05:19.803
a living fiend,

05:19.903 --> 05:22.306
you will be doomed

05:22.406 --> 05:27.353
never to know that sweet blood

05:27.453 --> 05:31.565
which will become your only...

05:31.665 --> 05:32.816
desire.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.452
(SOBS) No!

05:42.384 --> 05:45.579
You will watch,

05:45.679 --> 05:49.041
helpless and dying,

05:49.141 --> 05:53.262
until the black flesh
rots from your bones.

05:54.646 --> 05:58.308
Listen... for his cries.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.805
They will comfort you

06:02.905 --> 06:05.190
until your death.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.532
(LAUGHS)

06:24.635 --> 06:26.120
No!

06:26.220 --> 06:28.122

06:28.222 --> 06:32.042
(WHIMPERS) Help. Oh, help.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.094
Mamuwalde.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.768
Dracula?

09:28.819 --> 09:31.388
But he is dead, gentlemen.
Quite dead.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.932
He and his entire
household were destroyed

09:34.032 --> 09:38.395
by the great Dr Van Helsing
almost 150 years ago.

09:38.495 --> 09:42.491
Oh, what a pity.
I've never met a vampire.

09:43.584 --> 09:46.028
You should have told us whose
house this was in the village.

09:46.128 --> 09:48.113
Yeah, honey, now, wait.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.574
This is gonna change
our deal drastically.

09:50.674 --> 09:51.825
Oh, I see.

09:51.925 --> 09:55.078
Well, I can assure you,
gentlemen, it is quite safe now.

09:55.178 --> 10:00.217
The reports of the count
were grossly exaggerated.

10:00.934 --> 10:05.672
Perhaps if I subtract
another ten percent?

10:05.772 --> 10:08.467
- Fifteen.
- Very well.

10:08.567 --> 10:11.345
Consider your deal closed.
We'll take everything.

10:11.445 --> 10:14.806
You gentlemen had me
worried there for a moment.

10:14.906 --> 10:16.892
- If you please.
- I'd love to.

10:16.992 --> 10:19.027
- Right here.
- OK, great.

10:19.369 --> 10:23.649
You are obviously not attuned
to the antique market.

10:23.749 --> 10:27.277
You see, where we come from,
honey, the legend of Dracula...

10:27.377 --> 10:30.239
that's the absolute créme
de la créme of camp!

10:30.339 --> 10:33.208
We're gonna get a fortune
for these things.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.620
Count Dracula was no legend.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.373
- He was terribly real.
- Oh, I know.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.875
I've seen all of his movies.
I'm a real fan.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.086
Don't shock the poor man, Billy.

10:44.186 --> 10:47.881
Hey, is there anything else? Like
secret passages and things like that?

10:47.981 --> 10:52.094
Yes. When the castle was
restored a few years ago,

10:52.194 --> 10:55.480
they found several hidden rooms.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.485
Eugh, it smells terrible in here.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.487
Billy, look at this!

11:10.587 --> 11:12.914
Fantastic.

11:14.216 --> 11:17.578
Oh, this is gorgeous.
Look at this, Bobby.

11:17.678 --> 11:20.289
Honey, this is the coup
d'état of the century.

11:20.389 --> 11:24.042
Is this included in our deal,
or are you gonna fleece us now?

11:24.142 --> 11:26.128
You ain't gonna fleece us,
are you, baby?

11:26.228 --> 11:28.305
Well, if you want it...

12:18.071 --> 12:20.474
I can't wait to start
tagging all these goodies.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.477
We're gonna be rich, my love.

12:23.577 --> 12:26.188
Bobby, man, I can't see in here.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.907
I'm gonna light one
of the greasy lamps.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.627
Ta-dah!

12:43.180 --> 12:47.300
If the fire department could see
you now, you silly lamp queen.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.547
- Oh, this. I'm dying to open this!
- I'm not.

12:52.647 --> 12:57.185
Look, I have a fantastic idea for this.
You'll probably die if I tell you.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.222
In that case, spare me.
Let's get on with the tagging.

13:00.322 --> 13:03.100
Listen! You know that chintzy
guest bed in the living room?

13:03.200 --> 13:05.185
- Yeah.
- How about this instead?

13:05.285 --> 13:06.728
A coffin?

13:06.828 --> 13:08.947
It'll freak everyone out. Open it.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.833
Oh, Bobby!

13:27.933 --> 13:31.044
- Look what I've done!
- What the hell did you do?

13:31.144 --> 13:34.297
- What did you do? Let me see.
- Ouch.

13:34.397 --> 13:37.676
- Don't panic. Wait to see it.
- Oh! Argh!

13:37.776 --> 13:40.220
Please stop. Hold this there.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.514
Let me... oh...

13:42.614 --> 13:46.651
- Bobby, hurry. It's bleeding.
- Just a second!

13:49.120 --> 13:51.523
You're so dizzy. That's the trouble.

13:51.623 --> 13:54.568
- Put it up here.
- Just a second. Stop it!

13:54.668 --> 13:56.870
If you weren't so dizzy...

13:57.629 --> 14:00.081
- Ohh.
- Stop that whining.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.418
Look at me.

14:04.094 --> 14:06.246
- Move your hand.
- That's tight.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.090
I'm not a nurse, you know. All right?

14:09.724 --> 14:11.885
Would you stop it, please?

14:12.185 --> 14:14.504
- Take care. It's twisted.
- I'll take care of it.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.131
I'm gonna bleed to death.

14:16.231 --> 14:19.134
You're gonna bleed to death if
you don't keep your mouth shut!

14:19.234 --> 14:21.811
Keep quiet. You make me nervous.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.736
Bobby, I'll die.
I'm bleeding to death!

14:30.036 --> 14:32.030
Would you stop it, please?

14:36.501 --> 14:39.913
Child, be still! Stop!
What's wrong with you?

14:48.388 --> 14:52.592

We've come to pay our
respects to Bobby McCoy.

18:50.213 --> 18:51.740
Certainly, sir.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.868
These things are
always so very tragic,

18:54.968 --> 18:58.955
but I can perhaps be of some comfort
to you in this hour of need.

18:59.055 --> 19:02.333
This is one of our smaller rooms,
but it can be expanded

19:02.433 --> 19:05.628

It's only a reflex.

At his mother's request,
the body has not yet been embalmed.

I'm so sorry, but I can't
let you disarrange...

I'm Dr Thomas with the Scientific
Investigation Division.

20:16.799 --> 20:19.577
Of course. I'm so sorry, doctor.

20:19.677 --> 20:22.171
I didn't realise you
were a professional man.

20:22.639 --> 20:25.291
I worked very hard
on that neck wound,

20:25.391 --> 20:27.418
trying to make it look
as natural as I could

20:27.518 --> 20:29.504
so it wouldn't be offensive
to his loved ones.

out in a big chunk.

bite that size before.

- Rat bite?
- Yes, sir.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.056
How deep was the wound
before it was repaired?

20:40.156 --> 20:43.393
I don't know. Two or
three inches at least.

20:43.493 --> 20:46.154
- Two or three inches?
- Yes, sir.

20:46.913 --> 20:50.942
Any other bruises or wounds?

20:51.042 --> 20:55.405
A slight abrasion on the left elbow,
probably the result of a fall.

20:55.505 --> 20:58.158

21:03.846 --> 21:05.665
That is strange.

21:05.765 --> 21:09.218
Look at this. His veins are empty.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.755
They collapse with pressure
and don't return to shape,

21:12.855 --> 21:16.342
and he wouldn't be this colour
unless he'd lost a lot of blood.

21:16.442 --> 21:17.927
Who brought him in?

21:18.027 --> 21:21.439
I did. Picked him up at
the coroner's office.

21:22.448 --> 21:26.561
Did they mention... much bleeding?

21:26.661 --> 21:29.572
I can't say as they did, doctor.

21:31.499 --> 21:35.278
What about the other victim,
his associate?

21:35.378 --> 21:37.113
I didn't prepare that one.

many whites in here.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.188
Ah!

23:17.489 --> 23:19.039
Luva?

23:19.640 --> 23:20.908
Luva?

23:21.109 --> 23:23.436
- Let go!
- Luva, it's me.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.354
Wait!

24:05.862 --> 24:08.439
(TYRES SCREECH)

24:17.665 --> 24:20.693
Goddamnit, man!
You scared the hell out of me.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.780
Where did you come from?
Are you all right?

24:23.880 --> 24:26.282
What the hell you run
in front of my cab for?

24:26.382 --> 24:28.159
Can't you see, man?

24:28.259 --> 24:30.461
I lost her.

24:31.596 --> 24:33.164
Shit.

24:33.264 --> 24:37.251
You ain't hurt, man, but you lucky.

24:37.351 --> 24:40.588
Chasing tail could get
you killed, you know.

24:40.688 --> 24:44.008
I lost her because of you. Imbecile!

24:44.108 --> 24:45.593
Imbecile?

24:45.693 --> 24:48.346
Who the hell are you
calling an imbecile?

24:48.446 --> 24:50.973
You the nut that ran
in front of my cab.

24:51.073 --> 24:54.944
You the only imbecile
on this street... boy!

25:09.967 --> 25:14.455
You'll find her. She's got
to be round here somewhere.

25:14.555 --> 25:19.001
I bet you she's worried right
now and lookin' for you,

25:19.101 --> 25:22.672
so why don't you just back
off of me and go get her?

25:22.772 --> 25:25.508
I bet she's worried
to death about you.

25:25.608 --> 25:28.719
I bet she's called
every hospital around.

25:28.819 --> 25:32.106
Listen, take your hands off me!
I don't know you!

25:34.742 --> 25:37.486
(GROWLING)

26:25.585 --> 26:27.411

26:43.352 --> 26:45.463
Tina, get the chain. It's me!

26:45.563 --> 26:48.599
Michelle, thank God.

26:50.359 --> 26:52.603
What you doin' with that knife?

26:52.987 --> 26:55.097
Sorry. Get in.

26:55.197 --> 26:57.566
What's wrong with you?

27:00.453 --> 27:02.655
Tina, what happened?

27:11.047 --> 27:13.366
A man tried to attack me.

27:13.466 --> 27:15.618
(GASPS) He got my purse.
I'm sure of it.

27:15.718 --> 27:17.995
He got my keys and all my I.D.

27:18.095 --> 27:22.007
When I heard you at the door
just now, I thought it was him.

27:22.892 --> 27:25.878
Damn maniacs runnin' the streets.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.055
It's all right. It's OK.

27:28.773 --> 27:30.266
It's all right.

28:53.733 --> 28:55.968
- They'll take care of it for you.
- Thank you.

28:56.068 --> 28:59.722
- Bye-bye.
- Hi, Shirley. Sam here?

28:59.822 --> 29:02.725
Sure. Sam, Dr Thomas is here.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.685
- How ya doin'?
- Fine. You?

29:04.785 --> 29:07.071
- Fine. You're lookin' good.
- Thanks.

29:07.872 --> 29:08.814
Doc?

29:08.914 --> 29:13.069
I got a call from the coroner's
office to check on Juanita Jones.

29:13.169 --> 29:16.121
- You want to see her?
- That's why I'm here.

29:21.510 --> 29:23.913
Thought you worked nights.

29:24.013 --> 29:26.674
Everybody takes a vacation but me.

29:45.659 --> 29:47.861
There she is, doc.

29:50.915 --> 29:54.410
Fine job for a woman, running a cab.

29:55.836 --> 29:58.163
You ask me,
she's looking for something.

29:59.006 --> 30:02.493
You know what I mean...
"looking for something"?

30:02.593 --> 30:04.662
Yes. Sam, get me a cup
of coffee, will you?

30:04.762 --> 30:07.423
All right, I can take a hint.

31:02.653 --> 31:05.230
(CHUCKLES)

31:06.407 --> 31:08.484
Nah, that's ridiculous.

31:11.620 --> 31:14.523
Jack, I'm beginning to
take this personally.

31:14.623 --> 31:19.570
I'm tellin' ya, your men lost the report
on Bobby McCoy and Billy Schaffer.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.789
Lost, my ass.

31:22.923 --> 31:24.291
Maureen.

31:27.636 --> 31:30.873
- Yes, lieutenant.
- Get the division reports on... who?

31:30.973 --> 31:34.168
Bobby McCoy, Billy Schaffer.
From two nights ago.

31:34.268 --> 31:36.470
- Southwest Division.
- Right, lieutenant.

31:38.272 --> 31:41.175
Tell me something, man.
Off the record, of course.

31:41.275 --> 31:43.260
Yeah?

31:43.360 --> 31:45.554
Who checked the two bodies?

31:45.654 --> 31:48.107
In that area, it should be Watson.

31:48.908 --> 31:52.061
- Yeah, Watson.
- Is that the guy that... (CHUCKLES)

31:52.161 --> 31:55.147
...called cyanide poisoning
"heart failure"?

31:55.247 --> 31:57.574
I'm getting tired of
that kind of talk.

31:58.292 --> 32:01.654
Division says those reports
were lost before distribution.

32:01.754 --> 32:05.366
They said Dr Thomas' office
called this morning about them.

32:05.466 --> 32:08.661
The sergeant told Dr Thomas'
secretary he couldn't find them.

32:08.761 --> 32:11.255
Thanks, Maureen. Thank you.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.842
So it wasn't my lack of
pull at headquarters.

32:16.143 --> 32:20.089
Strange how so many sloppy
police jobs involve black victims.

32:20.189 --> 32:22.967
You're getting paranoid.
Schaffer wasn't black.

32:23.067 --> 32:25.135
We'll find them.
I'll send Barnes over.

32:25.235 --> 32:27.137
- Yes, lieutenant?
- Get Barnes in here.

32:27.237 --> 32:29.014
Look, what's going on?

32:29.114 --> 32:31.892
I see where you've ordered an
autopsy on Bobby McCoy today,

32:31.992 --> 32:34.812
and Juanita Jones is
scheduled for one on Friday.

32:34.912 --> 32:37.022
What's going on?
What's the connection?

32:37.122 --> 32:39.733
Did you want me, lieutenant?
Hello, doc.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.986
Get to the Southwest Division
and find the reports

32:42.086 --> 32:44.196
on Bobby McCoy and
Billy Schaffer, will you?

32:44.296 --> 32:46.949
Sure, lieutenant. What's goin' on?

32:47.049 --> 32:48.375
Do it.

32:53.347 --> 32:55.215
You've got something. What is it?

32:55.933 --> 32:59.336
- When I know, I'll tell you.
- Does it look organised?

32:59.436 --> 33:01.797
There's been a lot of
Panther activity lately.

33:01.897 --> 33:04.717
Panthers? Come on,
Jack, don't cop out.

33:04.817 --> 33:07.761
Two faggot interior decorators
and a lady cabdriver?

33:07.861 --> 33:09.889
Panthers? Oh, come on!

33:09.989 --> 33:11.223
Anything is possible.

33:11.323 --> 33:16.186
If it's possible, tell Barnes to bring
those reports to the club tonight.

33:16.286 --> 33:18.947
It's Michelle's birthday.

33:24.712 --> 33:26.405
Have a good time.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.790
(PHONE RINGS)

33:34.138 --> 33:36.707
- Hello?
- 'This is Dr Thomas.'

33:36.807 --> 33:38.042
Yes, Dr Thomas.

33:38.142 --> 33:41.629
Mr Swenson, we're gonna need to
do an autopsy on Bobby McCoy.

33:41.729 --> 33:43.631
I'll send for the body
sometime this afternoon.

33:43.731 --> 33:45.090
That's impossible.

33:45.190 --> 33:47.551
The family's here now.
I can't just throw them out.

33:47.651 --> 33:49.595
Of course, Mr Swenson.

33:49.695 --> 33:52.473
- What time do you close tonight?
- 'Eight o'clock.'

33:52.573 --> 33:55.601
All right, I'll have my men
there a little bit after 8:00.

33:55.701 --> 33:59.279
- They must be careful.
- They will be, Mr Swenson.

34:00.122 --> 34:02.407
- All right, then.
- Thanks.

34:04.877 --> 34:07.613
By the way, we had some
excitement ourselves last night.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.489
Tina got hassled on the way home.

34:09.590 --> 34:12.451
- Is she all right?
- She didn't go to work today.

34:12.551 --> 34:15.003
We're having the locks changed.
She thinks he got her purse.

34:15.763 --> 34:17.831
Next year, we move to the suburbs.

34:17.931 --> 34:20.884
Mm-hm. Like we did last year!

34:28.025 --> 34:30.719
<i>There he is again</i>

34:30.819 --> 34:35.139
<i>And he's making my heart
skip another beat</i>

34:35.239 --> 34:37.643
<i>- Now he's a-movin' in
- Watch out, baby</i>

34:37.743 --> 34:41.813
<i>Yeah, he's self-assured
like he was before</i>

34:41.914 --> 34:45.442
<i>And I know he thinks I
want him more and more</i>

34:45.542 --> 34:47.485
<i>And I know he thinks I want him</i>

<i>More and more</i>

<i>Oh, hey hey</i>

35:14.029 --> 35:17.858

35:24.623 --> 35:27.568
<i>There! There he is again</i>

35:27.668 --> 35:31.488
<i>And he's leading me on
with that lover's look</i>

35:31.588 --> 35:34.491
<i>I said there he is again</i>

35:34.591 --> 35:39.121
<i>And he's reading my mind
like it's an open book</i>

35:39.221 --> 35:41.832
<i>Now he's a real bad man</i>

35:41.932 --> 35:46.253
<i>And he's getting so close
that I can't control</i>

35:46.353 --> 35:48.505
<i>And I know he thinks I want him</i>

35:48.605 --> 35:50.090
<i>Oh, so much</i>

<i>And he's looking at me
from across the street</i>

36:36.153 --> 36:39.431

37:10.437 --> 37:12.472
Come join my friends.

37:21.156 --> 37:24.143
I'd like you to meet my sister
Michelle and Dr Gordon Thomas.

37:24.243 --> 37:27.146
- This is...
- I'm called Mamuwalde.

37:27.246 --> 37:28.480
Nice to meet you.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.857
Enchanté, mademoiselle.

37:29.957 --> 37:32.401
It's my sister's birthday party.
Would you care to join us?

37:32.501 --> 37:34.411
I'd be delighted, thank you.

37:36.296 --> 37:39.032
Champagne, please? French.

37:39.132 --> 37:40.492
That won't be necessary.

37:40.592 --> 37:43.162
What do you mean? I like champagne.

37:43.262 --> 37:45.046
Good. So do I.

37:46.181 --> 37:48.542
Tina, where did you find your purse?

37:48.642 --> 37:51.761
Mamuwalde returned it to me.
Thank you again.

37:52.145 --> 37:54.631
You bear an amazing
resemblance to my wife,

37:54.731 --> 37:57.893
whom I lost a short while ago.

37:58.235 --> 37:59.428
I'm very sorry.

37:59.528 --> 38:01.771
I loved her very much.

38:02.614 --> 38:06.276
When you left the mortuary,
I had to follow you.

38:06.702 --> 38:09.188
I didn't consider that
I might frighten you.

38:09.288 --> 38:12.324
You were at Swenson's.
Were you a friend of Bobby's?

38:12.624 --> 38:16.786
No, I was there making some
arrangements of my own.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.865
But enough about death.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.950
Here's to... life.

38:22.050 --> 38:23.577
- On your birthday.
- Thank you.

38:23.677 --> 38:24.995
Happy birthday, baby.

38:25.095 --> 38:27.923
- To happiness.
- To happiness forever.

What?

39:23.195 --> 39:25.397
What do you mean, gone?

39:26.365 --> 39:28.850
Listen, calm down,
Swenson. Calm down.

39:28.950 --> 39:31.861
I'll get a man over there right away.

39:32.120 --> 39:34.398
Don't touch anything, you hear me?

Swenson, damn it!
Don't touch anything!

<i>I'm gonna catch ya, baby</i>

39:40.879 --> 39:42.406
<i>Wait and see</i>

39:42.506 --> 39:43.907
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

39:44.007 --> 39:47.085
<i>Yes, I like what kind
of line you got for me</i>

<i>You told me you were going to score</i>

<i>Girl, let's stay at home...</i>

40:02.526 --> 40:04.636
Look at that face. What happened?

40:04.736 --> 40:08.398
That was Swenson.
Bobby's body just disappeared.

40:09.157 --> 40:11.852
- That's impossible.
- Perhaps he wasn't dead.

40:11.952 --> 40:13.812
What the hell does that mean?

40:13.912 --> 40:16.273
He was as dead as you can get.
I examined him myself.

40:16.373 --> 40:18.275
Just a passing thought.

40:18.375 --> 40:20.702
What's happening? How's everybody?

40:21.503 --> 40:25.332
How you doin'? My name is Skillet.
How's everything?

Let's pull up a seat here and
get some of this here...

40:29.428 --> 40:31.496
- Join the party.
- ...champagne.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.790
- Help yourself.
- French champagne!

40:33.890 --> 40:35.334
We gonna be gone.

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:51.358
Forget hysteria.
Mass unemployment, starting with me.

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:54.737
We'd better swamp the city
with police, cars on every corner.

01:01:54.837 --> 01:01:59.283
It won't make any sense...
to start until after dark.

01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:00.918
Keep in touch with me.

01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:04.538
Yeah, I'll let your
office know where I am.

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:06.840
Get some sleep. You look like hell.

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:10.844
Sure.

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:20.771
I got something to check out.

01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:26.360
<i>You and all your friends</i>

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:30.147
<i>Are gonna get together
in the end and tell me</i>

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:33.659
<i>What the world knows</i>

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:36.870
<i>About love</i>

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:41.375
<i>Yes, you will</i>

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:45.212
<i>Yes, you will</i>

01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:51.593
<i>Tell me how much you love me</i>

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:55.464
<i>Yeah, you gonna tell me
how it could have been</i>

01:02:55.564 --> 01:02:59.476
<i>If I had known more</i>

01:02:59.777 --> 01:03:02.729
<i>About love</i>

01:03:03.906 --> 01:03:05.941
<i>Yes, you will...</i>

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:08.143
- Good evening.
- How you doin'?

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:09.937
Sit down and have a drink.

01:03:10.037 --> 01:03:12.690
Thank you very much.
Very thoughtful of you.

01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:13.982
Hi. What'll you have?

01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:15.984
Make it a Bloody Mary.

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:18.445
Mamuwalde, maybe you can help me.

01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:21.240
Are you into the occult?

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:23.333
It has some fascination.

01:03:24.676 --> 01:03:27.129
How about the heavy stuff?

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:30.799
Witchcraft, voodoo...

01:03:31.642 --> 01:03:33.051
devil worship.

01:03:34.019 --> 01:03:35.462
Well, we can't ignore

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:39.349
what the world characterises
as the "black arts", can we?

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:43.554
I think that there's
some truth in all of it.

01:03:43.654 --> 01:03:45.605
I've come to that conclusion myself.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:50.602
- What do you think of vampires?
- Vampires?

01:03:50.702 --> 01:03:53.363
They're possibly the
most fascinating of all.

01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:58.986
Do you... believe they exist?

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:02.039
Does the devil exist?

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:05.459
People have believed so
for thousands of years.

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:07.995
You seem well informed.

01:04:08.095 --> 01:04:10.247
Oh, perhaps.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:13.967
The police have a theory
about these killings.

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:17.755
Are we to assume that
they believe a vampire

01:04:17.855 --> 01:04:20.424
or some other such
creature is responsible?

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:22.392
A vampire.

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:24.511
Fascinating.

01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:28.390
However, many in the
department don't believe it.

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:31.693
I would think that to be the
vampire's greatest defence.

01:04:32.703 --> 01:04:35.147
You're right.

01:04:35.247 --> 01:04:38.275
Still, they're organising a search.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:39.860
Search?

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:43.205
Yeah, find his resting place,
a vampire's coffin.

01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:48.285
Perhaps the modern vampire
doesn't require a coffin.

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:51.171
They are rather elusive, you know.

01:04:51.722 --> 01:04:54.291
What's happening, everybody?
What's goin' on?

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:57.127
- Hey, Skillet.
- How you doin'?

01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:59.171
- How you doin', doc?
- What's happening?

01:04:59.271 --> 01:05:01.882
My darling, we really
must be leaving now.

01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:03.926
Tina, I wish you'd stay with us.

01:05:04.026 --> 01:05:06.887
I'm sorry, but I'd rather
go with Mamuwalde.

01:05:06.987 --> 01:05:10.724
Say, Mamuwalde, let me buy
that old cape from you, brother.

01:05:10.824 --> 01:05:12.901
(MAMUWALDE LAUGHS)

01:05:15.621 --> 01:05:20.367
You know, he is a strange dude.

01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:23.779
Ran off of me like he did
Nancy the other night.

01:05:23.879 --> 01:05:25.956
Anybody seen Nancy?

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.576
No. She didn't bring my
birthday pictures back, either.

01:05:29.676 --> 01:05:31.328
Haven't seen her
since the other night.

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:33.121
Look here, brother.

01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:35.165
When you do see her,

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:37.960
tell Nancy that big Skillet

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:41.638
has got something
really groovy for her.

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:44.284
Mamuwalde.

01:06:46.795 --> 01:06:48.371
He's with Tina!

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:58.749
How could you be so blasé?
What were you trying to prove?

01:06:58.849 --> 01:07:01.209
They mean nothing to me.

01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:03.511
No one matters but you.

01:07:05.814 --> 01:07:08.183
Hold me. Just hold me.

01:07:23.498 --> 01:07:25.200
Tina...

01:07:26.043 --> 01:07:27.911
Come with me tonight.

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:37.420
Stop!

01:07:37.888 --> 01:07:40.207
No, Mamuwalde! Please don't hurt him!

01:07:40.307 --> 01:07:42.092
No, no!

01:07:43.143 --> 01:07:45.053
Gordon, are you all right?

01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:55.730
Hold it, mister!

01:08:14.966 --> 01:08:17.127
(MAMUWALDE LAUGHS)

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.816
You met him. Who is he?

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:45.104
God only knows. He calls
himself "Mamuwalde".

01:08:45.205 --> 01:08:47.858
- Where does he hang out?
- Hang out?

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.452
In a coffin around here somewhere.

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:53.321
- Hi, babe.
- Hi.

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:55.240
- How is Tina?
- I don't know.

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.625
I tried to get her to lie down, but...

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:02.456
Tina, you should still be resting.

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:04.541
I will. What happened?

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.960
- We heard shots.
- He killed a cop.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:11.139
- He killed him?
- He killed him, and he got away.

01:09:15.944 --> 01:09:17.520
You should rest.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.107
What do we do now?

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:23.518
Now we wait.

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:27.981
The only thing for sure is that
he has to return to his coffin...

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:30.325
before daylight.

01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:45.540
- Danny, take a look at that fag.
- Yeah, I'm lookin'.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.210
- Isn't that the one?
- Sure looks like the one.

01:09:48.310 --> 01:09:51.388
How can you tell?
They all look alike.

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:56.476
(PHONE RINGS)

01:09:58.195 --> 01:10:00.772
Hello? Just a minute. Jack?

01:10:02.449 --> 01:10:04.109
Yeah?

01:10:04.576 --> 01:10:05.777
Where?

01:10:07.037 --> 01:10:09.739
OK, tell them to keep a
bead on them but hold back.

01:10:10.165 --> 01:10:12.192
They found Bobby.
He's picked up a friend.

01:10:12.292 --> 01:10:15.445
- Oh, my God.
- Keep Tina here no matter what.

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:17.739
We'll leave some men
to watch the place.

01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:20.166
Let's go. That guy
with him is in trouble.

01:10:23.303 --> 01:10:26.256
- Keep this with you.
- OK.

01:10:34.648 --> 01:10:36.975
The subject is heading east on 5th.

01:10:38.026 --> 01:10:41.020
Get a grid over that area. Maybe we
can figure out where they're going.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:56.744
They're gone, lieutenant.
We lost them in an alley.

01:10:57.295 --> 01:11:00.240
Don't... repeat,
don't follow on foot.

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:01.741
We'll take over from here.

01:11:01.841 --> 01:11:03.585
Right, lieutenant.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.622
Name every building in that sector.

01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:09.799
Go through it street by street.

01:11:10.642 --> 01:11:12.802
We've pinpointed that sector.

Jacob Iron Foundry...'

01:11:18.358 --> 01:11:20.927
This will never work.

We gotta keep going.

I say, were you looking for me?

I should have told you this evening
that I decided to move my coffin,

but, then, it was you
who gave me the idea.

planned for Tina?

to me than my own.

you now, doctor,

has killed innocent people.

(SHOUTS) A bat! A bat!

01:19:11.873 --> 01:19:13.566
A giant bat!

01:19:13.666 --> 01:19:15.409
- It's him.
- Tina...!

01:19:17.754 --> 01:19:19.246
Tina?

01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:21.582
Gordon, she's gone.

01:19:33.644 --> 01:19:35.838
Attention, all units,
this is Lieutenant Peters.

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:39.008
'All units, Lieutenant Peters.
Do not apprehend the girl.

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:41.477
'Just survey and watch for suspect.'

This is Unit 603.

01:20:14.519 --> 01:20:16.629
We are proceeding east on Florence.

01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:18.297
No sign of subject.

01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:22.018
<i>Come love, give to me</i>

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:27.732
<i>We will take the sky...</i>

01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:31.360
Hey, isn't that her?

01:20:31.828 --> 01:20:33.229
Drive on by.

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:38.075
<i>I see my main chance with you</i>

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:43.289
<i>If my main chance falls through</i>

01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:51.205
<i>I could live forever</i>

01:20:51.305 --> 01:20:57.795
<i>But I'd know I'll never</i>

01:20:57.895 --> 01:21:04.393
<i>Have a chance at living</i>

01:21:04.777 --> 01:21:07.146
<i>Again...</i>

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:11.559
Unit 3, Baker 92. It looks like her.

01:21:11.659 --> 01:21:14.437
'She's entering Underground

(SIRENS OVERHEAD)

01:23:01.811 --> 01:23:04.221
What is it? What's going on?

01:23:13.739 --> 01:23:15.683
You two take that side.

01:23:15.783 --> 01:23:17.359
Come on.

01:23:58.659 --> 01:24:01.103
- Where is he?
- Down there, sir.

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:03.606
All right, if you find him,
don't try to take him.

01:24:03.706 --> 01:24:05.650
Just back off and yell
for me or Dr Thomas.

01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:08.202
- Keep your eyes open for his coffin.
- Let's go.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:33.219
Help me... please.

01:24:33.319 --> 01:24:36.522
Tina... Tina... Don't die, Tina.

01:24:57.384 --> 01:24:59.169
My Luva.

01:25:00.513 --> 01:25:02.923
I cannot lose you again.

01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:06.719
Forgive me. Now this is the only way.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:11.598
You will be with me... always.

01:25:25.538 --> 01:25:27.406
Dr Thomas!

01:25:28.249 --> 01:25:30.242
Dr Thomas!

01:25:31.085 --> 01:25:34.321
You and your dear friends are dead.

01:25:34.421 --> 01:25:37.291
Not one man shall
escape my vengeance!

01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:40.828
Not one man shall leave here alive!

01:25:40.928 --> 01:25:45.374
Search out every shadow,
every corner...

01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:48.711
This will be your inglorious tomb!

01:25:48.811 --> 01:25:50.171
Your tomb!

01:28:36.437 --> 01:28:37.713
- Grab her!

Where the hell is Mamuwalde?

01:28:59.626 --> 01:29:02.037
I'm here, gentlemen.

01:29:07.259 --> 01:29:09.169
Move away from her.

01:29:41.877 --> 01:29:43.495
Tina.

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.583
My lovely, lovely Tina.

01:29:48.842 --> 01:29:51.086
What is left for this
cursed creature?

01:29:52.179 --> 01:29:54.881
His only reason for living
has been taken away.
