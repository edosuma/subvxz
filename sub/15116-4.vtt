WEBVTT

00:01.545 --> 00:03.560
I never kiss and tell.

00:03.634 --> 00:04.968
Yeah, right.

00:05.002 --> 00:06.169
All right.

00:06.203 --> 00:07.770
My ball.

00:07.805 --> 00:08.972
7-ball, corner pocket.

00:09.006 --> 00:10.440
All right.

00:10.474 --> 00:11.941
What about Ann Weisler?

00:11.976 --> 00:13.509
What about her?

00:13.544 --> 00:15.048
Couldn't keep <i>that</i> a secret.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.871
You're the only person
I told about that.

00:16.895 --> 00:18.789
What happened that night
will die with me.

00:18.823 --> 00:20.211
<i>I love the Ann Weisler story.</i>

00:20.245 --> 00:22.300
<i>Making love on the beach</i>
<i>in Del Mar,</i>

00:22.334 --> 00:23.597
<i>getting tangled up in the kelp.</i>

00:23.632 --> 00:25.297
<i>Kelp is sexy.</i>

00:25.331 --> 00:27.003
Okay, like I said,
I didn't tell anybody.

00:27.037 --> 00:28.339
Pindar's not anybody.

00:28.373 --> 00:29.572
What about you and Hanna?

00:29.606 --> 00:30.937
Okay --
nothing happened

00:30.971 --> 00:32.069
with me and Hanna, okay?

00:32.103 --> 00:33.467
Your husband said,

00:33.502 --> 00:34.902
"You knew who I was
when you married me,"

00:34.936 --> 00:36.934
after you confronted him
about cheating on you.

00:36.969 --> 00:38.899
You see,
that's an admission of guilt

00:38.933 --> 00:41.064
and will trigger the infidelity
clause against him.

00:41.099 --> 00:42.798
I don't want things
to get nasty.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.868
Oh, well, let's hope
they don't come to that.

00:44.902 --> 00:46.635
You can catch more flies
with honey.

00:46.669 --> 00:49.071
Ready?
Oh. Mulligan.

00:49.105 --> 00:50.437
-You got it, buddy.
-Thanks, buddy.

00:50.471 --> 00:53.571
Karp's coming!

00:55.304 --> 00:57.004
By the way,
did I tell you --

00:57.039 --> 00:58.807
I actually breed
Portuguese honeybees.

00:58.841 --> 01:00.807
Why don't we step
into my office?

01:00.842 --> 01:02.777
Mm.

01:02.811 --> 01:05.178
Surprise!

01:06.647 --> 01:07.681
Happy Birthday!

01:07.715 --> 01:09.483
You do not look 50.

01:09.517 --> 01:10.916
There, I've said it.

01:10.951 --> 01:13.019
That's because I'm not
anywhere <i>near</i> 50.

01:13.053 --> 01:14.319
Birthday? I thought

01:14.354 --> 01:15.687
-that was in September.
It is.

01:15.721 --> 01:17.855
Well, it wouldn't have
been a surprise then.

01:17.889 --> 01:19.822
-What's this?
-This is from us.

01:19.857 --> 01:21.790
And the firm chipped in
for all of it.

01:21.824 --> 01:23.390
-Stanton.
-So...

01:23.424 --> 01:25.024
-Ah.
- Thanks, Stanton.

01:25.059 --> 01:26.558
And who is this?

01:26.593 --> 01:28.292
Oh, this is Maya Paxton.

01:28.326 --> 01:30.826
She's what we call a "client."
We're handling her divorce.

01:30.860 --> 01:32.660
You know, you'd think
with my name above the door,

01:32.695 --> 01:35.528
<i>somebody</i> would put a beverage
in my hand.

01:35.562 --> 01:38.530
Ah. Derek.
How's your wife?

01:38.564 --> 01:40.365
Come on.

01:40.399 --> 01:42.300
Maya Paxton.

01:42.335 --> 01:44.301
Yeah.
Wife of Rick Paxton.

01:44.336 --> 01:46.236
-Guy who climbed Everest alone?
-Oh.

01:46.271 --> 01:48.271
Ballooned solo
around the globe.

01:48.305 --> 01:50.206
Swam the English channel --

01:50.241 --> 01:52.040
guy is a walking
cologne commercial.

01:52.075 --> 01:54.442
Paxton also owns a significant
video-game company.

01:54.476 --> 01:56.143
For now.
We'll take care of that.

01:56.177 --> 01:58.579
Um, I don't know how many of you
will have jobs tomorrow,

01:58.613 --> 02:00.379
but you should probably
get back to them.

02:00.414 --> 02:02.281
Damien, loosen up!

02:02.315 --> 02:03.481
It's almost your birthday!

02:03.516 --> 02:05.683
Hey.
Here's the thing.

02:05.717 --> 02:06.983
Let me give you
a little tip here.

02:07.017 --> 02:09.451
Girls like a guy
who know how to have fun.

02:09.485 --> 02:11.919
-Lots of fun.
-Oh.

02:11.953 --> 02:13.987
See, I want this to be a good
horse race between you and me.

02:14.022 --> 02:15.121
But right now,

02:15.156 --> 02:16.855
I'm just pulling ahead.

02:16.890 --> 02:18.256
I'm way out there.

02:18.291 --> 02:19.558
Oh. Yeah.

02:19.592 --> 02:20.926
That's a very cool guitar.

02:20.960 --> 02:21.994
Do you mind if I...

02:22.028 --> 02:23.495
Sure.

02:23.530 --> 02:25.096
Thanks.

02:25.131 --> 02:26.264
Need a pick?

02:26.299 --> 02:27.566
Sure, I'll use
your plectrum.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.601
"Plectrum."

02:29.636 --> 02:31.236
That's beautiful.

02:31.270 --> 02:32.871
That <i>is</i> beautiful.

02:32.905 --> 02:34.906
-Absolutely.
-Did you write that?

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074

02:52.824 --> 02:55.659

02:55.694 --> 02:56.927
Thank you, Jared.

02:56.961 --> 02:59.296
I'm gonna get back to my desk.

03:00.898 --> 03:02.232
You should tune --
you should tune it.

03:02.266 --> 03:03.700
-<i>You</i> should tune it.
-You should tune it.

All right, boys.

03:29.622 --> 03:31.122
You might want to back up
for this one.

03:31.156 --> 03:33.223
I don't feel so good.
I don't want to do this.

03:33.258 --> 03:35.025
Get somebody short, please.
I'm gonna be sick.

03:35.059 --> 03:36.626
Pindy,
if you puke near me again,

03:36.660 --> 03:38.160
I swear to God,
I will take off your head.

Just do it, then!

03:40.096 --> 03:43.465
Oh! Awesome!

03:43.499 --> 03:45.734
All right. Pay up.

03:45.768 --> 03:48.069
Ohh. Uh, listen, if this
private-investigator thing

03:48.103 --> 03:50.371
doesn't work out,
there's always special forces.

03:50.406 --> 03:52.173
Thank you.

03:52.208 --> 03:54.675
I get a cut of that.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.379
Let me ask you --

03:59.414 --> 04:01.715
if you were a chick,
would you go for me or Karp?

04:01.749 --> 04:03.350
-Karp.
-What?

04:03.384 --> 04:05.952
What? He's got the
Porsche, the Wilshire condo,

04:05.986 --> 04:07.119
the Soho house membership.

04:07.154 --> 04:08.587
Okay,
you are one vapid chick.

04:08.621 --> 04:10.289
You know what?
I don't even want to date you.

04:10.323 --> 04:11.957
Well, it's a moot point,
'cause I'd be boning Karp.

04:11.991 --> 04:13.291
I want to see
other people.

04:13.325 --> 04:14.492
Go ahead.

04:14.526 --> 04:16.060
Oh!

04:16.095 --> 04:17.128
Is that...

04:17.161 --> 04:18.529
Everybody's all-American!

04:18.563 --> 04:20.531
Danny Dubois!

04:20.565 --> 04:22.634
Double D! Yeah!

04:22.668 --> 04:24.203
How great is this place,

04:24.237 --> 04:26.037
after 10 years
you can still cruise it

04:26.072 --> 04:27.638
and know something's
happening here?

04:27.673 --> 04:29.273
Yeah, that <i>is</i> great.
We should move.

04:29.308 --> 04:30.975
Well, Double D heard that.

04:32.778 --> 04:34.179
You did the thing
with the face!

04:34.213 --> 04:35.680
Let's move in together!

04:35.714 --> 04:37.282
We should!
That wouldn't be awkward at all!

04:37.316 --> 04:38.750
Last we heard,

04:38.784 --> 04:41.019
you were some hedge-fund guy
in Connecticut.

04:41.054 --> 04:42.387
Yeah. Just out here
visiting family.

04:42.422 --> 04:44.089
Sure you don't want a drink?

04:44.123 --> 04:46.224
No, thanks.
I do need a lawyer, though.

04:46.259 --> 04:48.160
Last week, I got caught up
in a little brawl.

04:48.194 --> 04:50.295
-Like a brouhaha?
- I don't know.

04:50.330 --> 04:51.731
I was at a strip club,

04:51.765 --> 04:52.999
and there were beer, fists,
and teeth flying.

04:53.033 --> 04:54.267
-Ah, a donnybrook.
-Ah.

04:54.301 --> 04:55.735
Oh. Sweet.

04:55.769 --> 04:57.536
So I thought I'd throw
a little business your way,

04:57.570 --> 04:59.638
and since Bash here
is tapping the D.A...

04:59.672 --> 05:01.540
We broke up.

05:01.574 --> 05:03.075
That sucks.

05:03.109 --> 05:04.977
Yeah, also, we're
with Infeld/Daniels now.

05:05.011 --> 05:06.612
We don't really do donnybrooks.

05:06.646 --> 05:08.680
So give us a call when you start
embezzling pension funds.

05:08.714 --> 05:10.148
Nad!

05:10.182 --> 05:11.983
Still a wise-ass!

05:12.017 --> 05:14.720
Don't call me "Nad."

05:17.122 --> 05:19.257
Danny's a tool.

05:19.292 --> 05:21.526
He was a tool back then,
he's a tool now.

05:21.561 --> 05:24.262
Is this about
the shower thing?

05:24.297 --> 05:25.864
Oh, come on.

05:25.898 --> 05:27.466
That was 15 years ago!

05:27.500 --> 05:28.700
Yeah.

05:28.735 --> 05:30.903
Fine. You know what?
We'll do it.

05:30.937 --> 05:33.739
Any excuse for you
to see your ex.

05:37.677 --> 05:39.911
Danny was at home
when his buddy Mike Cromwell

05:39.945 --> 05:41.412
called from the club.

05:41.447 --> 05:42.747
Some guys were messing
with Mike and he needed backup,

05:42.782 --> 05:43.849
so he called Danny.

05:43.883 --> 05:45.283
So why call the cops?

05:45.318 --> 05:46.818
Danny ends up
getting his ass kicked

05:46.853 --> 05:48.120
while Mike hid behind the bar.

05:48.154 --> 05:49.788
Guess who gets charged
with the assault.

05:49.822 --> 05:51.557
-Your client.
-Exactly.

05:51.591 --> 05:53.359
Look at the report.
Everyone was throwing punches.

05:53.393 --> 05:55.361
Including your client.

05:55.395 --> 05:56.596
Sitting this one out, Jared?

05:56.630 --> 05:58.397
Just the meetings
involving you.

05:58.432 --> 06:00.032
Look, he's got no record,

06:00.067 --> 06:01.901
and there's no way to tell
who started the fight.

06:01.935 --> 06:03.536
I'm reading.

06:04.972 --> 06:06.439
Stop biting your lip.

06:06.473 --> 06:08.241
Stop looking at me.

06:08.275 --> 06:09.709
She knows
that's a strong move.

06:09.743 --> 06:10.877
Oh, sometime today.

06:10.911 --> 06:12.579
Okay. Talk.

06:12.613 --> 06:13.913
All right.
The club manager

06:13.948 --> 06:15.248
has no interest
in pursuing this case.

06:15.282 --> 06:17.217
It's not my case.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.618
It's been assigned to
Ellen Swatello.

06:18.652 --> 06:19.786
No!
She <i>hates</i> us.

06:19.820 --> 06:21.220
She hates everybody.

06:21.255 --> 06:22.588
I'll talk to her,

06:22.623 --> 06:23.856
see if I can get her
to reduce the charges.

06:23.891 --> 06:25.458
Thank you.

06:27.928 --> 06:29.762
You're just being cruel.

06:31.865 --> 06:32.832
Stop.

06:32.866 --> 06:34.066
What?

06:34.101 --> 06:36.602
Okay. Let's begin.

06:36.636 --> 06:38.871
Even though this is
an arbitration

06:38.905 --> 06:41.406
and the evidentiary rules
are relaxed,

06:41.441 --> 06:43.174
the rule of law still applies.

06:43.209 --> 06:45.076
All right, all right.

06:45.110 --> 06:46.744
Can we just do this, please?

06:46.778 --> 06:48.245
Sure.
How about ladies first?

06:48.280 --> 06:50.914
My client, Maya Paxton,
is seeking a divorce

06:50.949 --> 06:52.115
for loss of consortium.

06:52.150 --> 06:54.718
Mr. Paxton lost interest
in his wife.

06:54.752 --> 06:57.020
They haven't had sex
in eight months,

06:57.054 --> 06:58.288
which suggests that he reverted
to his old ways.

06:58.322 --> 06:59.856
We're gonna show
that Rick Paxton

06:59.890 --> 07:01.457
violated the infidelity clause
in the prenup.

07:01.491 --> 07:03.092
That's not true.

07:03.894 --> 07:05.461
Interesting theory.

07:05.496 --> 07:07.263
I don't suppose
you have any proof?

07:07.297 --> 07:09.431
Aside from the fact he's obviously
grown tired of sleeping --

07:09.466 --> 07:11.000
Glenna!

07:11.034 --> 07:13.201
He's right. Unless
you want to get sanctioned,

07:13.236 --> 07:14.402
I wouldn't finish that sentence.

07:14.437 --> 07:15.837
We're working
on the proof.

07:15.872 --> 07:17.005
We'll find it.
Trust me.

07:17.039 --> 07:19.141
When someone cheats,
I find out eventually.

07:19.175 --> 07:21.510
Because of Mr. Paxton's
sexual history,

07:21.544 --> 07:24.046
dual infidelity clauses were instituted,
punishing both parties.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.848
I'm aware of that.

07:25.882 --> 07:27.817
Well, it's hard for my
client to have sex with his wife

07:27.852 --> 07:30.955
if she's always in Florida
doing her home-shopping show.

07:30.989 --> 07:32.690
I-it's even harder
to have sex

07:32.724 --> 07:34.558
when her husband's crossing
the Atlantic in a balloon.

07:34.593 --> 07:37.729
Assuming he didn't have
his girlfriend <i>in</i> the balloon.

07:37.763 --> 07:39.897
Whoa.
Whoa, now, hold on.

07:39.932 --> 07:42.800
Now, it's one thing to say
that I cheated on Maya,

07:42.835 --> 07:45.436
it's another to say that
I cheated on my solo flight.

07:45.470 --> 07:47.338
Wow, so glad to see

07:47.372 --> 07:49.039
you have your priorities
in order, Rick.

07:49.074 --> 07:51.475
I mean, God forbid you'd cheat
on a balloon.

07:57.314 --> 07:59.849
Your honor,
I believe the prosecution --

07:59.884 --> 08:02.152
who, by the way,
looks radiant today --

08:02.186 --> 08:04.988
has a motion to reduce
the charges?

08:05.023 --> 08:09.026
I'm aware Mr. Bash spoke
to my <i>happily</i> engaged colleague,

08:09.061 --> 08:10.528
Janie Ross.

08:10.562 --> 08:11.896
Ohh. She went
for your knees there, bro.

08:11.931 --> 08:13.898
Unsportsmanlike conduct,
your honor.

08:13.933 --> 08:15.500
It does seem a bit personal.

08:15.534 --> 08:17.502
No kidding.
Thank you. Your honor.

08:17.537 --> 08:19.237
But new evidence
has come to light

08:19.272 --> 08:20.605
that requires a new charge
be added --

08:20.640 --> 08:22.040
driving under the influence.

08:22.074 --> 08:24.642
D.U.I.?
Come on, this was a little...

08:24.676 --> 08:25.910
A donnybrook.

08:25.944 --> 08:27.711
Which your client
drove to drunk.

08:27.746 --> 08:29.013
We have security-camera footage

08:29.047 --> 08:30.514
of the defendant
driving recklessly

08:30.548 --> 08:32.515
across a golf course
and up to the strip club.

08:32.549 --> 08:34.484
I drove up in a golf cart.

08:34.518 --> 08:35.717
And when
the police arrived,

08:35.753 --> 08:37.053
they took everyone's
blood alcohol,

08:37.087 --> 08:38.520
and Mr. Dubois' was above
the legal limit.

08:38.554 --> 08:40.054
Did you charge everyone

08:40.090 --> 08:41.756
who drove to the club
with d.U.I.?

08:41.792 --> 08:43.559
Just the ones who punched
the arresting officer.

08:43.594 --> 08:46.129
He wasn't wearing a uniform.

08:46.163 --> 08:47.596
I didn't mean to punch him.

08:47.631 --> 08:48.864
I didn't mean to punch you.

08:48.899 --> 08:50.232
It would have been helpful

08:50.267 --> 08:52.067
if you mentioned that detail
to us, Double D.

08:52.102 --> 08:53.636
Assault charges gone.

08:53.670 --> 08:55.505
Drunk-driving charges added.

08:55.539 --> 08:59.209
Wow, I didn't see <i>that</i> coming.
Did you, Mr. Bash?

09:07.604 --> 09:08.899
What kind of stunt was that?

09:09.038 --> 09:11.206
Look who's whining
about stunts.

09:11.240 --> 09:12.607
See you guys at trial.

09:12.642 --> 09:14.643
What is her problem?

09:14.677 --> 09:17.279
What is your problem?!

09:17.313 --> 09:18.847
Oh. Ohh. Really?

09:18.881 --> 09:20.081
-You asked.
-I didn't ask anything.

09:20.116 --> 09:21.149
You asked the question.

09:21.183 --> 09:22.417
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:22.451 --> 09:24.052
I've been here eight years,

09:24.086 --> 09:25.420
and I still have to deal
with imbeciles like you two,

09:25.455 --> 09:26.788
while your sainted
suck-up Janie,

09:26.823 --> 09:28.523
who's been here
half as long as me,

09:28.557 --> 09:29.858
gets bumped up to Major Crimes.

09:29.892 --> 09:32.427
Yeah, okay.
Have a nice day.

09:33.832 --> 09:36.126
Why can't I find a woman
like that?

09:36.127 --> 09:37.595
What's going on?

09:37.596 --> 09:38.391
If the cop's so pissed,

09:38.393 --> 09:39.694
why don't they just stick
with the assault?

09:39.728 --> 09:41.329
'Cause if they just
charged you

09:41.363 --> 09:42.764
and not everyone
who threw a punch,

09:42.798 --> 09:43.964
we'd argue selective
prosecution.

09:43.999 --> 09:45.366
Now they can go after just you.

09:45.400 --> 09:46.900
Yeah, they're gonna ask
for jail time,

09:46.935 --> 09:48.702
and if you're convicted,
they'll get it.

09:48.736 --> 09:50.970
Guys, I had two beers.
I wasn't drunk.

09:51.005 --> 09:52.438
Again, where were you

09:52.473 --> 09:53.839
when you got the call
to go to the club?

09:53.874 --> 09:55.174
I was kicking it at home.

09:55.208 --> 09:56.508
Okay, when you say
"Kicking it" --

09:56.542 --> 09:58.777
feel free to join us
in this decade --

09:58.811 --> 10:00.145
where would that be?

10:01.747 --> 10:03.981
That's not a tough
question. Where were you?

10:04.016 --> 10:06.517
I live with my grandmother.

10:06.552 --> 10:09.587
I got in the game
just as the economy tanked,

10:09.621 --> 10:12.123
so I was the last hired
and the first fired.

10:12.158 --> 10:15.528
Couldn't keep the condo,
so I came here.

10:15.562 --> 10:18.264
Are you gonna be able
to pay us?

10:18.299 --> 10:21.936
I was kind of hoping
you had a pro bono policy.

10:21.970 --> 10:23.604
"Bro Bono."

10:23.639 --> 10:24.572
Hey, Nana.

10:24.607 --> 10:26.341
Hey, Danny, come on!

10:26.375 --> 10:28.076
We got to get to the market.

10:28.110 --> 10:30.311
We miss free samples
after 5:00.

10:30.346 --> 10:35.117
If I get a D.U.I.,
do I lose my license?

10:35.151 --> 10:37.319
Yeah, probably.
For a while.

10:37.353 --> 10:39.955
I drive my grandmother
and her friends

10:39.989 --> 10:41.223
to the doctor and errands.

10:41.257 --> 10:43.358
I thought it'd be
a pain in the ass,

10:43.393 --> 10:44.793
but turns out
they keep me young.

10:44.828 --> 10:45.928
Danny! Come on!

10:45.962 --> 10:46.996
All right, all right.

10:47.030 --> 10:49.565
For God's sake, come on.

10:51.034 --> 10:52.401
Admit it!

10:52.435 --> 10:54.203
You're happy that Danny's fallen
on rough times.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.038
He was a dick to you
in high school.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.706
That's not true, Peter,

10:57.741 --> 10:59.475
because there,
but for the grace of God, go I.

10:59.509 --> 11:00.943
If I were a douche.

11:00.978 --> 11:03.579
Hey.
What happened?

11:04.782 --> 11:06.049
Your colleagues only succeeded

11:06.083 --> 11:07.617
in getting Rick
and his lawyer angry.

11:07.651 --> 11:09.585
And what a raging bitch.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.954
Well, Hanna and Karp know that
your husband's a public figure

11:11.989 --> 11:13.589
and he wants to keep
the divorce quiet.

11:13.624 --> 11:15.358
But the threat
of blowing up the arbitration

11:15.392 --> 11:17.794
and taking this to a public
trial is sound legal advice.

11:17.828 --> 11:19.663
It just lacks
human compassion

11:19.697 --> 11:21.998
and puts more money
into our firm and theirs.

11:23.333 --> 11:25.635
I appreciate the honesty.

11:25.669 --> 11:28.137
Could use a little bit of that
in my life.

11:28.172 --> 11:29.272
Thank you.

11:29.306 --> 11:30.907
Anytime!

11:30.942 --> 11:32.642
We're open three days a week.

11:32.676 --> 11:34.944
You really are determined
to get us fired, aren't you?

11:34.978 --> 11:36.346
<i>Carmen talked</i>
<i>to a stripper</i>

11:36.380 --> 11:37.747
<i>who saw Danny break up</i>
<i>the fight.</i>

11:37.782 --> 11:39.116
<i>Why not put her on the stand?</i>

11:39.150 --> 11:41.018
Thought about it,
but jurors don't like strippers.

11:41.052 --> 11:42.586
You know who
they do love? Old people.

11:42.621 --> 11:45.056
Gonna talk to Danny's
grandmother and her friends,

11:45.090 --> 11:47.025
see if any of them noticed that
Danny was sober when he left.

11:47.059 --> 11:48.593
<i>I love old people.</i>

11:48.628 --> 11:50.896
<i>I tried to live in</i>
<i>a retirement home once.</i>

11:50.930 --> 11:53.832
<i>They're clean, there's no</i>
<i>stigma to being housebound,</i>

11:53.867 --> 11:55.200
<i>and the food is delicious.</i>

11:55.235 --> 11:56.568
<i>Let me handle this.</i>

11:56.602 --> 11:58.370
You got it, pal.
Just keep your eye on the ball.

11:58.404 --> 12:01.106
I got a call
from Maya Paxton.

12:01.140 --> 12:03.810
She was very impressed
with your candor this afternoon.

12:03.844 --> 12:06.512
Me? Not so much.
Hi, Pindar.

12:06.547 --> 12:08.013
<i>Hello, sir.</i>

12:08.048 --> 12:09.014
You upset?

12:09.049 --> 12:10.549
Well, we're not

12:10.584 --> 12:11.884
the poverty law center, Jared.

12:11.918 --> 12:14.653
We're actually in this
to make a profit.

12:14.687 --> 12:16.855
However, Maya liked you so much,

12:16.889 --> 12:19.924
she wants you
on the Paxton arbitration.

12:19.958 --> 12:21.725
With Hanna?

12:21.760 --> 12:23.260
Well, I-I need him
on the assault case.

12:23.294 --> 12:24.995
Damien can fill you in
with the details.

12:25.029 --> 12:26.996
Or Hanna.
Probably Hanna.

12:27.031 --> 12:28.397
Yeah.

12:30.534 --> 12:33.369
Uh, is there something
I should know about those two?

12:33.403 --> 12:35.504
-No.
-Really?

12:35.539 --> 12:36.572
No.

12:36.606 --> 12:38.240
There's been some talk.

12:38.275 --> 12:42.110
I-I don't listen
to...that...kind of stuff.

12:42.145 --> 12:44.279
Really? Hmm.

12:44.313 --> 12:46.548
All right. Hmm.

12:51.922 --> 12:54.023
We all together?

12:58.962 --> 13:00.897
<i>I am, of course,</i>
<i>Pindar Singh.</i>

13:00.931 --> 13:02.598
<i>I wish I could be there</i>
<i>with you today,</i>

13:02.633 --> 13:04.133
<i>but I am unfortunately</i>
<i>stuck in London.</i>

13:04.168 --> 13:05.702
<i>That's bullshit.</i>

13:05.736 --> 13:07.838
-<i>Get out of here!</i>
-<i>Bullshit!</i>

13:09.107 --> 13:12.542
<i>I want to thank you</i>
<i>all for coming today.</i>

13:12.577 --> 13:14.778
Whatever we can do
to help my grandson.

13:14.812 --> 13:17.080
<i>Okay. You live at</i>
<i>the Palms. Stellar facility.</i>

13:17.114 --> 13:20.950
<i>Not as nice as Coldwater Creek,</i>
<i>but a much nicer piano.</i>

13:20.984 --> 13:23.619
I hate the parrot
in the lobby. Nasty bird.

13:23.653 --> 13:25.153
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Who said that?</i>

13:25.188 --> 13:27.522
-Me. I hate birds.
-<i>Me too.</i>

13:27.556 --> 13:29.657
<i>Did you know that birds</i>
<i>carry more germs than rodents?</i>

13:29.692 --> 13:31.860
I used to shoot 'em
out of my bedroom window

13:31.894 --> 13:34.896
till the home took away
my second amendment rights.

13:34.931 --> 13:36.932
<i>Perhaps we can kill</i>
<i>birds together someday, miss...</i>

13:36.966 --> 13:39.935
-Nanette.
-<i>...Nanette.</i>

13:39.969 --> 13:43.939
<i>Uh, how much did Danny</i>
<i>have to drink that night?</i>

13:43.973 --> 13:46.208
We were at my place
watching "Ice Road Truckers,"

13:46.242 --> 13:47.709
and Danny dropped by
after his run.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.911
We tend to congregate
in my room.

13:49.946 --> 13:51.213
Best TV in the village.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.617
<i>Nanette is talking!</i>

13:54.651 --> 13:56.819
<i>Thank you.</i>

13:56.854 --> 13:58.187
<i>Hi.</i>

13:58.222 --> 14:00.123
Hi.

14:00.157 --> 14:03.193
<i>Um, how much</i>
<i>did Danny have to drink?</i>

14:03.227 --> 14:04.894
He was on his second beer

14:04.929 --> 14:06.930
when the phone call came
from his friend.

14:06.964 --> 14:09.465
<i>Is there any way</i>
<i>to back up your recollection</i>

14:09.500 --> 14:11.234
<i>that Danny only had two beers?</i>

14:11.268 --> 14:13.970
Well, I still have
four beers from that six-pack

14:14.004 --> 14:15.405
in my fridge.

14:15.439 --> 14:16.739
Would that help?

14:16.773 --> 14:18.574
<i>Doesn't hurt...</i>

14:18.609 --> 14:20.009
<i>Nanette.</i>

14:20.044 --> 14:22.078
Pindar.

14:27.218 --> 14:28.986
The plans for my dream house

14:29.020 --> 14:30.821
were drawn up
before I even met Maya.

14:30.855 --> 14:33.290
I mean, if there's any dream
involved here, it's <i>mine.</i>

14:33.324 --> 14:34.658
Rick can have it.

14:34.692 --> 14:35.959
Ain't no thing.

14:35.994 --> 14:37.528
I don't want it.

14:37.562 --> 14:40.164
Maya,
we didn't agree to this.

14:40.198 --> 14:43.133
Jared and I discussed it
on the way over,

14:43.168 --> 14:44.835
and the house is a disaster.

14:44.870 --> 14:46.337
Well, fine.

14:46.371 --> 14:48.940
Uh, then Maya can have the --
the cabin in Aspen.

14:48.974 --> 14:50.508
I mean, she's the skier
in the family --

14:50.542 --> 14:52.710
or <i>was</i> the skier.

14:52.745 --> 14:54.012
Mm.

14:54.046 --> 14:55.414
How did you let this happen?

14:55.448 --> 14:56.982
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

14:57.017 --> 14:58.784
Let's keep moving.
We can be done in an hour.

14:58.818 --> 15:00.753
Great.
I'll make a tee time for 2:00.

15:00.787 --> 15:02.021
Hey, wait a minute!

15:02.056 --> 15:03.623
Yes. Everybody just needs
to stop being so...

15:03.657 --> 15:04.857
Decent?

15:04.892 --> 15:06.459
This is a complicated case.

15:06.494 --> 15:08.862
There are
irreconcilable differences.

15:08.896 --> 15:10.864
Like the fact that Mr. Paxton

15:10.898 --> 15:12.198
is cheating on his wife.

15:12.233 --> 15:13.466
Oh, absent proof.

15:13.501 --> 15:14.967
I don't see how you think...

15:17.437 --> 15:19.070
We got phone records, e-mails,

15:19.105 --> 15:22.006
and...those pictures
are pretty clear evidence

15:22.041 --> 15:23.208
of a relationship.

15:27.613 --> 15:29.581
Your client's
little transgression

15:29.615 --> 15:30.749
just triggered item five...

15:30.783 --> 15:32.751
to the tune of $60 million.

15:32.785 --> 15:34.853
Fine.

15:34.887 --> 15:36.755
I raise you...

15:36.789 --> 15:39.624
another $60 million.

15:39.659 --> 15:41.359
Whoa.

15:43.362 --> 15:46.364
Wait a minute.

15:46.398 --> 15:50.668
Both sleeping
with the same mistress?

15:51.870 --> 15:53.704
How very green of you.

15:56.341 --> 15:57.474
Put them together, it's funner.

15:57.509 --> 15:59.009
-Wow.
-Yeah.

16:00.298 --> 16:01.377
Why didn't you tell us?

16:01.378 --> 16:02.679
It's not what it looks like.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.639
Question for the scary lady.

16:06.991 --> 16:08.292
<i>That</i> one.

16:08.326 --> 16:09.693
Why are we seeing this crap now?

16:09.727 --> 16:11.327
Why are we just seeing yours?

16:11.362 --> 16:12.863
We just learned about it.

16:12.897 --> 16:14.097
Oh, please.

16:14.131 --> 16:16.399
And if you hadn't spent
so much time

16:16.434 --> 16:18.068
trolling the sludge
to get your client

16:18.102 --> 16:20.003
a payoff she doesn't deserve,
we wouldn't have been forced

16:20.037 --> 16:21.805
to counter your
unsubstantiated story with ours.

16:21.839 --> 16:23.106
It's a draw, people.

16:23.140 --> 16:24.307
Let's go home.

16:24.342 --> 16:26.776
It was a kiss goodbye.

16:26.811 --> 16:28.144
I didn't cheat.

16:28.179 --> 16:29.579
I know.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.281
We're the last of
a dying breed, Maya.

16:31.315 --> 16:33.450
You dumped me.
Why am <i>i</i> the one who cheated?

16:33.484 --> 16:34.985
Okay. Hanna and I
didn't have sex.

16:35.019 --> 16:36.119
Let's put that to bed.

16:36.154 --> 16:38.388
Okay, since both clients

16:38.422 --> 16:39.889
violated the infidelity clause,

16:39.924 --> 16:41.658
your client isn't entitled
to $60 million.

16:41.692 --> 16:42.626
Well, fine.

16:42.660 --> 16:45.028
M-maybe I did cheat.

16:45.062 --> 16:47.296
But that doesn't mean
I don't love you.

16:48.999 --> 16:50.867
Maya.

16:50.901 --> 16:53.270
That sounded an awful lot
like an admission of an affair.

16:53.305 --> 16:55.539
-Uh, he said "maybe."
-What were you thinking?

16:55.574 --> 16:57.241
-I can't believe you.
-Carmen?

16:57.276 --> 16:59.344
You want me to find out
who's cheating on who.

16:59.378 --> 17:00.778
Okay, you couldn't
possibly have known

17:00.813 --> 17:01.880
I was gonna ask you that.

17:01.914 --> 17:03.581
I'll take care of it.

17:09.589 --> 17:10.857
Where'd everybody go?

17:10.891 --> 17:13.226
<i>You'll be great.</i>
<i>Don't be nervous.</i>

17:13.260 --> 17:15.161
I'll be fine!

17:15.195 --> 17:16.863
You've walked me
through my testimony

17:16.896 --> 17:18.198
seven times.

17:18.232 --> 17:20.465
<i>Leave me on for the trial.</i>

17:23.170 --> 17:25.271
Did you bring the remaining
four beers from the six-pack?

17:25.306 --> 17:26.640
They're right there
next to you.

17:26.674 --> 17:28.709
Oh.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.310
Your honor, I'd ask
that these beers be marked

17:30.344 --> 17:32.011
-as defense exhibit "C."
-So marked.

17:32.046 --> 17:33.746
How do you know these are
the same beers, ma'am?

17:33.781 --> 17:35.314
I don't drink,

17:35.349 --> 17:36.916
but I always keep a six-pack
in the fridge for Danny.

17:36.950 --> 17:39.585
Oh, so sweet.

17:39.619 --> 17:41.019
Now, I assume the prosecution

17:41.054 --> 17:44.689
will attack your memory
based on...

17:44.723 --> 17:45.856
My age.

17:45.891 --> 17:46.991
You can say it.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.859
I'm 74.

17:51.762 --> 17:53.630
"The Moon is Blue."

17:53.664 --> 17:56.467
William Holden
and David Niven.

17:56.501 --> 17:59.870
Written by F. Hugh Herbert,
directed by Otto Preminger,

17:59.904 --> 18:01.705
in 1953.

18:01.740 --> 18:04.108
Nanette has memorized
every movie

18:04.142 --> 18:05.276
for the past 60 years.

18:05.310 --> 18:07.445
Miss Swatello...

18:07.479 --> 18:08.613
care to challenge her memory?

18:08.647 --> 18:10.148
Your honor?

18:10.182 --> 18:12.284
Uh, "Leprechaun"?

18:12.318 --> 18:14.420
Nice.

18:14.454 --> 18:17.122
Written and directed
by Mark Jones in 1993,

18:17.157 --> 18:19.158
starring Warwick Davis

18:19.192 --> 18:21.794
and...a young Jennifer Aniston.

18:21.829 --> 18:23.730
Yeah.

18:23.764 --> 18:25.032
It's a parlor trick.

18:25.066 --> 18:26.567
It doesn't show her ability

18:26.601 --> 18:28.903
to remember relevant details
in a given moment.

18:28.937 --> 18:30.504
Which is why I brought this!

18:30.539 --> 18:32.173
Your honor,
with the court's permission,

18:32.207 --> 18:34.441
I'd like to blindfold Nanette
to prove her recall.

18:34.475 --> 18:36.076
Granted.

18:46.186 --> 18:47.787
Nanette...

18:47.821 --> 18:50.723
The juror in the back row,
second from the right,

18:50.757 --> 18:52.190
what's she wearing?

18:52.225 --> 18:54.860
Tangerine top,
almost matches her hair.

18:56.730 --> 18:59.198
How about the D.A.,
Miss Swatello?

18:59.232 --> 19:01.600
Gray pants, gray jacket,

19:01.634 --> 19:04.169
even her shoes --
everything is gray.

19:04.203 --> 19:06.472
The mural
behind me -- what is it?

19:06.506 --> 19:08.674
Native Americans
greeting settlers

19:08.708 --> 19:10.042
at the Pacific Ocean.

19:10.076 --> 19:11.977
And what are they holding?

19:12.011 --> 19:13.245
Corn.

19:15.014 --> 19:18.249
Corn.

19:27.425 --> 19:28.992
Excuse me.

19:29.027 --> 19:30.961
-Hi.
- Can I help you?

19:30.995 --> 19:32.696
I've got a house
I want to build.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.298
I hear you're good
at drawing them.

19:34.332 --> 19:36.434
I'd love to help you, but...

19:41.574 --> 19:44.176
A kiss goodbye
while waiting for my car.

19:44.211 --> 19:46.980
Frozen, it looks like
something else.

19:47.014 --> 19:49.316
Yeah.
Frozen -- well...It looks hot.

19:49.350 --> 19:52.086
Maya and I met on the plans

19:52.120 --> 19:53.988
when Rick was out of town.

19:54.022 --> 19:55.789
Seriously, it was nothing.

19:55.823 --> 19:58.959
And was this nothing, too?

20:04.899 --> 20:08.235
Look,
I never slept with Rick.

20:08.269 --> 20:09.570
One time, we almost --

20:09.604 --> 20:11.639
You know, I could
subpoena you to tell us.

20:11.673 --> 20:15.310
And I could sit there
and keep my mouth shut.

20:16.646 --> 20:19.181
Or I could make stuff up about
Maya that you wouldn't like.

20:21.518 --> 20:24.654
Your memory is impressive,

20:24.688 --> 20:26.389
but I'd like to challenge you
one more time.

20:26.424 --> 20:29.893
Do you remember where you were
the night of May 6, 1998?

20:29.928 --> 20:31.495
Objection.

20:31.530 --> 20:33.197
What does that have to do
with the events on August 2nd?

20:33.231 --> 20:34.965
It's the date
Nanette Norton

20:34.999 --> 20:36.400
was convicted of prostitution.

20:38.669 --> 20:40.503
Miss Norton
has never been --

20:40.537 --> 20:41.904
Miss Norton wasn't.

20:41.939 --> 20:43.640
But Nancy Blesoe was.

20:43.674 --> 20:46.509
Or was it Miranda Cain?

20:46.543 --> 20:49.011
You've had several aliases,
haven't you?

20:52.715 --> 20:53.782
Yes.

20:53.816 --> 20:55.084
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

20:55.118 --> 20:57.152
<i>My Nanette's a whore!</i>

20:58.287 --> 20:59.788
But I'm not lying about Danny!

20:59.823 --> 21:01.924
He only drank <i>two</i> beers.

21:01.958 --> 21:03.426
Due respect,

21:03.460 --> 21:05.161
but everything about you
is a lie.

21:05.195 --> 21:07.396
You've been convicted
of credit-card fraud,

21:07.431 --> 21:10.399
kiting checks, and three other
prostitution convictions.

21:10.433 --> 21:11.934
In fact,

21:11.968 --> 21:13.535
I'm starting to think
maybe today's not the first time

21:13.570 --> 21:15.237
you were asked to be
blindfolded.

21:15.271 --> 21:18.073
Was it?

21:20.377 --> 21:22.411
So, Allison was in love
with Rick Paxton,

21:22.446 --> 21:23.813
but not Maya?

21:23.848 --> 21:24.947
Well, that's one
for the home team.

21:24.982 --> 21:26.182
Well, not so fast.

21:26.216 --> 21:27.516
Maya <i>was</i> in love
with Rick Paxton,

21:27.551 --> 21:29.185
but Paxton wasn't in love
with her.

21:29.220 --> 21:30.787
In fact,
they never even had sex.

21:30.821 --> 21:32.022
Well, they almost did
but didn't.

21:32.056 --> 21:33.357
She didn't say why.

21:33.391 --> 21:35.159
Wait --
when Maya confronted Rick

21:35.193 --> 21:36.894
about having the affair
with Allison,

21:36.929 --> 21:38.329
he basically admitted to it,

21:38.363 --> 21:40.231
and now she's saying
that they didn't consummate?

21:40.265 --> 21:41.366
Why would Allison be lying?

21:41.400 --> 21:42.534
Maybe she's not.

21:42.568 --> 21:44.102
Do you think <i>he</i> is?

21:44.137 --> 21:45.737
Paxton
is admitting to an affair

21:45.772 --> 21:47.673
-so he can lose $11 million.
-He's a guy.

21:47.707 --> 21:50.510
Guy's accused of cheating --
his first instinct is to lie.

21:50.544 --> 21:52.545
Rick's first instinct
is to admit it?

21:52.579 --> 21:54.647
Well,
maybe he <i>was</i> being honest

21:54.681 --> 21:57.282
about what really happened
when they were together,

21:57.317 --> 21:58.817
instead of...lying about it.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.685
He's hiding something.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.954
You getting a blip
on the gaydar?

22:02.988 --> 22:05.923
The guy's a notorious
international womanizer.

22:05.957 --> 22:07.658
Hell, he markets himself
that way.

22:07.692 --> 22:09.359
Then...What?

22:09.393 --> 22:10.493
What do men lie about?

22:10.528 --> 22:12.028
-Money.
-Size.

22:12.062 --> 22:13.630
-<i>Everything.</i>
-Girth.

22:13.664 --> 22:15.366
Okay.
A little angry. All right?

22:15.400 --> 22:16.667
You're in the right ballpark.

22:16.701 --> 22:17.868
As Rick Paxton will tell you,

22:17.902 --> 22:19.369
it's not the size
of the balloon,

22:19.404 --> 22:21.138
it's whether you can get it
off the ground.

22:21.172 --> 22:22.406
Spare us the analogies.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.141
He couldn't get an erection.

22:24.175 --> 22:25.943
Okay,
so if he was willing

22:25.977 --> 22:28.045
to pay off the prenup to keep
his private business private,

22:28.079 --> 22:30.213
then how are we gonna get him
to admit to it?

22:34.051 --> 22:36.553
This is why you hire us.

22:48.466 --> 22:51.802
My sweet old lady
turned out to be a hooker.

22:51.836 --> 22:54.572
Who doesn't have one
of those in their lives?

22:54.606 --> 22:56.474
Makes me
want to play a song.

22:56.508 --> 22:57.942
That's unfortunate.

22:57.976 --> 22:59.276
All right.
You name the artist.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.078
Okay. Cold War Kids.

23:01.113 --> 23:02.480
Ah, something between
the Eagles or AC/DC.

23:02.514 --> 23:03.681
But you choose --
just as long as it's...

23:03.715 --> 23:04.949
The Eagles or AC/DC.

23:04.983 --> 23:06.216
That -- no --
I don't think so.

23:06.251 --> 23:08.185
Hey.
I need to talk to you.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.353
No, me first.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.988
Nanette imploded
on the stand today.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.824
So we're stuck with the rising
blood alcohol defense.

23:12.858 --> 23:15.059
Well, maybe the relevant
time isn't when he drank

23:15.094 --> 23:16.428
but whether the alcohol
was in his system

23:16.462 --> 23:18.030
when he got in the golf cart.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.932
Yeah, I like it,
but the jury needs something

23:19.966 --> 23:22.001
they can sink their teeth into,
not an anatomy lesson.

23:22.035 --> 23:23.303
Speaking of anatomy,

23:23.337 --> 23:24.771
I think I can win our case
with Maya

23:24.805 --> 23:26.373
if I can get some alone time
with Rick Paxton.

23:26.407 --> 23:28.275
To talk about what?

23:28.310 --> 23:30.478
Okay, you only get one joke about
this 'cause I got to move on it, all right?

23:30.512 --> 23:33.080
-Promise.
-His flaccid penis.

23:33.115 --> 23:36.784
You can't negotiate with the
opposing party without his lawyer present.

23:36.819 --> 23:38.753
I just want to invite him
to Margarita Monday at the cave.

23:38.787 --> 23:41.856
Where's it say it's against the law to
invite someone to a party?

23:41.890 --> 23:44.058
How about the California
attorney's code of professional conduct?

23:44.092 --> 23:45.526
See, I always thought of
that as more of a guideline.

23:45.561 --> 23:46.994
Seriously, that's it
on "flaccid penis"?

23:47.029 --> 23:48.529
Too easy.

23:48.563 --> 23:50.030
I was really hoping
for something there.

23:50.065 --> 23:52.266
Don't talk to
Rick Paxton! It's too risky!

23:52.300 --> 23:56.903
Which makes
for a bigger reward!

24:06.747 --> 24:08.147
Oh.

24:10.750 --> 24:13.719
Uh, you can't approach me
without my counsel.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.954
We're just riding together.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.555
I haven't said anything.

24:20.626 --> 24:23.894
You know, your architect said
you didn't have sex with her.

24:23.929 --> 24:26.997
You say you did.
One of you is lying.

24:28.033 --> 24:30.400
Well, so much
for just riding together.

24:30.435 --> 24:32.236
Do you want to tell me why,

24:32.271 --> 24:33.638
or should we take this to court?

24:33.672 --> 24:36.975
Well,
you won't be trying it,

24:37.009 --> 24:38.610
because you will be disbarred.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.245
Well, then
I'll take you down with me.

24:40.279 --> 24:41.980
I'm just kidding. But I <i>will</i>
take you down with me.

24:42.014 --> 24:45.250
Oh, so this is
blackmail, too?

24:45.284 --> 24:49.321
Unless you agree to come
to Margarita Monday at my place.

24:49.355 --> 24:52.390
8:00 -- bathing suits optional.

24:52.425 --> 24:53.658
You give me 10 minutes.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.794
You don't like
what I have to say,

24:55.828 --> 24:57.863
all it costs you
is an epic party.

24:57.897 --> 25:00.031
After that, we can go back
to the arbitration,

25:00.065 --> 25:02.100
lawyers get rich,
and you can turn me in.

25:03.036 --> 25:04.870
10 minutes.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.638
Oh. It's your call.

25:12.883 --> 25:14.269
You crossed the line.

25:14.511 --> 25:15.778
We're Franklin and Bash.

25:15.812 --> 25:17.079
We crossed the line
10 exits back.

25:17.113 --> 25:18.848
This is
an ethics violation

25:18.882 --> 25:20.616
that could put us out
on our asses.

25:20.650 --> 25:22.418
I don't understand
how you can be so calm.

25:22.452 --> 25:24.053
Because I know
Paxton will come,

25:24.087 --> 25:25.354
and I know I'm right on this.

25:25.388 --> 25:26.755
Well, you better be, Jared.

25:26.790 --> 25:28.224
And you better be Peter.

25:28.258 --> 25:30.058
He's just stressed
about Danny's trial.

25:30.093 --> 25:31.993
Well, it's not his fault.

25:32.028 --> 25:33.695
He got a loser.

25:33.730 --> 25:36.064
Hey, what'd I do to you
to make you hate me so much?

25:36.098 --> 25:37.632
Because I don't even remember.

25:37.666 --> 25:40.668
Kind of says it all
right there, doesn't it?

25:43.872 --> 25:45.006
Come in!

25:45.040 --> 25:47.074
Hi.

25:47.109 --> 25:48.209
Carmen sent me.

25:48.243 --> 25:49.910

25:49.945 --> 25:51.445

25:51.480 --> 25:53.046
Oh.

25:56.851 --> 25:58.051
Oh.

25:59.654 --> 26:01.821
You got five minutes.

26:22.275 --> 26:24.644
Well...

26:24.678 --> 26:26.178
Look who flew back from London.

26:26.213 --> 26:28.181
I didn't break any laws.

26:28.215 --> 26:29.349
You're so pretty.

26:29.383 --> 26:31.518
It's funny. I...

26:31.552 --> 26:33.654
I feel like I know you.

26:33.688 --> 26:38.593
But, actually, this is the first
time I've seen you face-to-face.

26:38.627 --> 26:41.396
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
the truth.

26:41.430 --> 26:44.231
I guess whatever you did
12 years ago is your business.

26:44.266 --> 26:48.168
12 years ago
is when I was last arrested.

So, is it always like this here?

27:02.685 --> 27:05.253
Ah, sorry.
It's a school night.

27:05.288 --> 27:07.757
You should see it
on the weekends.

27:07.791 --> 27:09.992
Ahh.

27:10.027 --> 27:11.260
Okay. Talk.

27:11.295 --> 27:14.531
I know why you didn't
have sex with Allison Cruze.

27:14.565 --> 27:16.800
What makes you think I didn't?

27:16.834 --> 27:20.303
Because the same thing happened
to me a couple weeks ago

27:20.338 --> 27:21.471
in this very house.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.775
This girl came over --
smoking hot.

27:24.809 --> 27:26.543
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

27:26.577 --> 27:28.645
Not...Hanna Linden?

27:28.680 --> 27:31.448
Well, she came over,

27:31.483 --> 27:35.552
and it got a little crazy,
and when it was "go" time, I...

27:35.587 --> 27:38.722
couldn't storm the beach.

27:38.756 --> 27:39.922
- Ah.
-It's humiliating.

27:39.957 --> 27:41.958
It's every guy's
worst nightmare, right?

27:41.992 --> 27:45.729
Ahh.

27:45.763 --> 27:47.163
Advantage, Karp. Huh?

27:49.634 --> 27:50.600
Well, it is one thing

27:50.635 --> 27:52.069
for <i>me</i> to go soft --

27:52.103 --> 27:54.605
it's another thing
if it turns out <i>you</i> did.

27:54.639 --> 27:57.442
<i>Stirred Magazine's</i>
"Most virile man alive."

27:57.476 --> 28:00.178
That's not just bad for
your reputation, that's bad --

28:00.212 --> 28:01.512
Excuse me, boys.

28:01.547 --> 28:03.481
That's bad for your business.

28:03.515 --> 28:06.284
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.686
Come on. That's why
you wanted arbitration,

28:08.720 --> 28:09.920
instead of a trial.

28:09.955 --> 28:11.422
You'd rather be guilty
of infidelity

28:11.456 --> 28:12.823
and sweep it under the rug

28:12.858 --> 28:14.758
than let the world know
that you might be...

28:14.793 --> 28:16.093
Impotent.

28:19.831 --> 28:21.698
Look...

28:24.102 --> 28:26.437
...I think it was environmental.

28:26.471 --> 28:27.938
-It --
-No, no.

28:27.973 --> 28:30.808
See, we had black mold
in our new house.

28:30.842 --> 28:34.145
I saw online somewhere that --
that there's these -- these...

28:34.179 --> 28:35.246
Side effects.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.647
Okay. Yeah.

28:36.682 --> 28:38.416
Well, mine was
environmental, too.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.351
'Cause, see,
we were all set to go,

28:40.386 --> 28:41.920
and then an ABBA song came on,

28:41.954 --> 28:43.922
-and that was it.

28:43.956 --> 28:47.192
Look, I read almost all
of your autobiography

28:47.226 --> 28:48.659
a couple of times, okay?

28:48.694 --> 28:50.027
You're not a quitter.

28:50.061 --> 28:52.830
Okay, Maya's there.

28:52.864 --> 28:55.099
Go get her.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.543
Another dive!

29:11.417 --> 29:13.118
<i>What</i> is going on?

29:13.152 --> 29:15.120
"Cocoon" drinking game.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.589
Every time one of the retirees
in the movie

29:17.624 --> 29:21.127
takes a dive in the pool,
they take a shot.

29:21.161 --> 29:22.862
Wow.

29:22.896 --> 29:24.997
We going to jail?

29:25.031 --> 29:26.698
I don't think so.

29:26.733 --> 29:29.334
I think I may have gotten
through to Paxton.

29:33.572 --> 29:36.040
Those folks really like
Danny, huh?

29:36.075 --> 29:39.877
They're gonna be lost
without him if we lose this.

29:39.911 --> 29:42.379
Maybe I'll help you win it.

29:42.414 --> 29:44.147
Not for Danny, but for them.

29:44.182 --> 29:45.983
You know what?

29:46.017 --> 29:48.219
You can.

29:48.253 --> 29:50.655
I think you can, buddy.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.892
Ohh, no.

29:57.940 --> 29:59.540
Come on, let's go.
We're late.

29:59.575 --> 30:01.876
I'm coming. I'm coming.

30:01.910 --> 30:03.778
-Hey, got a sec?
-Uh, not really.

30:03.812 --> 30:05.947
-We're late for court. Okay.
-It'll only be a minute.

30:05.982 --> 30:08.617
Be over here...
Not listening.

30:08.651 --> 30:09.984
I want to talk to you

30:10.018 --> 30:11.052
about the rumors going around
about us.

30:11.086 --> 30:12.587
What rumors?

30:12.621 --> 30:14.588
You're telling everyone
that we didn't have sex?

30:14.623 --> 30:17.191
'Cause I got your back.

30:17.225 --> 30:19.960
This is not the
Monday after prom, Jared, okay?

30:19.995 --> 30:22.496
I don't care what people
think <i>ever.</i>

30:22.531 --> 30:24.031
And if they find out the truth

30:24.065 --> 30:26.199
that we had crazy,
headboard-banging sex

30:26.234 --> 30:27.634
and that I had 19 orgasms

30:27.669 --> 30:29.603
that made me see
flying unicorns,

30:29.638 --> 30:30.638
that's fine by me.

30:30.672 --> 30:32.106
Because I'm a big girl,

30:32.141 --> 30:34.542
and I'm responsible
for everything I do,

30:34.576 --> 30:37.812
whether it's in the courtroom
or the bedroom.

30:37.847 --> 30:40.948
Okay.

30:40.982 --> 30:43.084
All right, then.

30:43.118 --> 30:45.219
Uh, I'll see you at arbitration.

30:45.254 --> 30:47.588
Yeah.

30:53.662 --> 30:55.563
What time does the
security camera show my client

30:55.597 --> 30:58.433
driving through the golf course,
which is a private property,

30:58.468 --> 31:00.903
and the only thing he risked
injuring were ducks?

31:00.937 --> 31:02.805
Not to interrupt
Mr. Bash's editorial,

31:02.839 --> 31:05.040
but he also drove
on Marina Boulevard.

31:05.074 --> 31:07.108
This is <i>my</i> time.

31:09.611 --> 31:13.848
And he <i>crossed --</i>
crossed Marina Boulevard

31:13.883 --> 31:17.818
36 feet at 8 miles an hour.

31:17.853 --> 31:19.820
The footage was taken
at 10:41 p.m.

31:19.855 --> 31:22.189
And at what time did you
administer the blood alcohol test?

31:22.223 --> 31:23.924
11:10 p.m.

31:23.958 --> 31:26.460
5 minutes after
he punched me in the face.

31:34.570 --> 31:37.039
And a half hour
after he was driving?

31:37.074 --> 31:40.944
O-objection!

31:40.978 --> 31:43.146
Mr. Bash, would you
care to tell me what you're doing

31:43.181 --> 31:45.649
before I hold you and
your colleague in contempt?

31:45.683 --> 31:47.450
We're arguing
how it takes time

31:47.485 --> 31:49.686
for alcohol to be absorbed
into a person's body.

31:49.720 --> 31:51.854
Mr. Franklin is demonstrating
that to the jury.

31:51.889 --> 31:53.722
Oh, would it have
killed you to chill these?

31:53.757 --> 31:55.257
My God.

31:55.291 --> 31:57.025
Take out your taser, Chuck.

31:57.059 --> 31:58.760
If he takes another sip, hit him
with everything you've got.

31:58.794 --> 32:01.228
May we approach the bench
with Penn and Teller?

32:01.263 --> 32:03.330
Fine.

32:03.364 --> 32:04.998
I'd ask that
officer Preston be allowed

32:05.032 --> 32:06.199
to administer a field sobriety
test to Mr. Franklin.

32:06.233 --> 32:08.068
Your honor, this is --

32:08.102 --> 32:10.370
Respectfully, your honor,
we know you're new to the bench.

32:10.404 --> 32:12.138
I'd hate to see you
overturned on appeal.

32:12.173 --> 32:13.874
-I mean, that's --
-Embarrassing.

32:13.908 --> 32:15.041
Very embarrassing.

32:17.078 --> 32:20.080
Can you check to see
if Mr. Franklin is drunk,

32:20.115 --> 32:22.016
in addition to being insane?

32:24.753 --> 32:26.020
You're on, kid.

32:26.054 --> 32:28.088
You're on.

32:36.664 --> 32:37.964
Officer Preston...

32:37.999 --> 32:40.367
15 minutes ago you gave
Mr. Franklin a sobriety test

32:40.401 --> 32:43.036
that registered a result
of .001.

32:43.070 --> 32:44.938
-Is that the legal limit?
- Yes.

32:44.972 --> 32:46.606
Okay,
could you have Mr. Franklin

32:46.640 --> 32:47.741
blow into this device again?

32:49.543 --> 32:51.044
I'm good.

32:56.184 --> 32:58.420
Could you please blow, sir?

33:11.767 --> 33:12.968
.09.

33:13.002 --> 33:15.103
-That's above the legal limit.
-Yeah, it is.

33:15.137 --> 33:18.005
Does he appear
under the influence?

33:18.039 --> 33:19.440
Yes.

33:19.474 --> 33:20.774
Lightweight.

33:20.809 --> 33:22.910
I love you.

33:24.245 --> 33:26.480
But he wasn't 15 minutes ago.

33:26.514 --> 33:29.250
Isn't it possible that
Danny Dubois was sober

33:29.284 --> 33:30.818
when he drove the golf cart

33:30.852 --> 33:32.220
but legally intoxicated

33:32.254 --> 33:34.422
when he was tested
after the fight?

33:34.456 --> 33:37.091
It's possible
he was under the limit

33:37.126 --> 33:38.226
when he was driving.

33:38.261 --> 33:39.528
It's possible.

33:42.665 --> 33:45.167
No further questions.

33:48.104 --> 33:49.538
You can sit down now.

33:49.572 --> 33:51.274
<i>You</i> can sit down.

33:51.308 --> 33:53.442
Hoo!

33:55.179 --> 33:58.447
You finally figured out
a way to get wasted in court.

33:58.481 --> 33:59.748
So who is it?

33:59.783 --> 34:01.383
Who is who?

34:01.418 --> 34:03.519
Who is the guy who has
to spend eternity with...

34:03.553 --> 34:04.820
with this?

34:04.854 --> 34:06.888
Don't be hostile, Jared.

34:06.923 --> 34:09.324
You get custody of Peter.
You won.

34:09.358 --> 34:11.359
You know,
I've listened to Peter

34:11.393 --> 34:13.562
talk about how beautiful
you are, and I never saw it.

34:13.596 --> 34:14.696
But now...

34:14.730 --> 34:16.231
seeing you standing there,

34:16.264 --> 34:18.132
with beer goggles...

34:18.167 --> 34:19.835
I still don't get it!

34:19.869 --> 34:21.268
I don't get it. I really --

34:21.304 --> 34:22.938
If you want to pretend

34:22.972 --> 34:25.341
you didn't spend your first year
of law school

34:25.375 --> 34:26.809
staring at me in con law,
go ahead.

34:26.842 --> 34:28.911
I was looking
at Professor Hayes.

34:28.945 --> 34:30.178
You were in the front row,

34:30.213 --> 34:31.246
which says everything about you.

34:32.616 --> 34:34.183
Answer your damn phone.

34:34.217 --> 34:36.652
Is that me?

34:38.554 --> 34:39.989
Pizza Hut.

34:40.023 --> 34:42.425
Karp, honey.

34:42.460 --> 34:45.862
Okay, I'll be right there.
All right, uh...

34:45.896 --> 34:48.797
Uh, Rick and Maya Paxton
are on their way to the office.

34:48.831 --> 34:50.266
They say it's urgent.

34:50.301 --> 34:52.368
Think I'm a little too
inebriated to drive back.

34:52.402 --> 34:53.835
On a couple of beers?

34:53.870 --> 34:56.572
I had the other two
after the second sobriety test.

34:56.606 --> 34:58.140
-What?!
-I was celebrating!

34:58.174 --> 34:59.574
I can stop anytime I want to.

34:59.609 --> 35:01.643
Look, I just don't want
to take the risk, okay?

35:01.677 --> 35:03.778
You go in my place.
I'll stay here.

35:03.813 --> 35:05.013
You'll be back in time.

35:05.047 --> 35:07.249
If not, I'll ask
for a continuance.

35:07.284 --> 35:09.151
Right. What could possibly
go wrong with <i>that</i> plan?

35:09.185 --> 35:10.486
There you go.

35:10.520 --> 35:11.887
Bye!

35:22.767 --> 35:25.803
Thanks for
joining us, Mr. Franklin.

35:25.837 --> 35:27.070
Where's Mr. Bash?

35:27.105 --> 35:29.006
Uh, little problem.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.542
He was called away
on emergency,

35:31.576 --> 35:35.779
so if we could get a brief...
Continu-- continuation,

35:35.813 --> 35:37.380
that'd be great.

35:37.415 --> 35:39.782
I'm not gonna
keep this jury waiting.

35:39.817 --> 35:41.017
You're co-counsel.

35:41.051 --> 35:42.585
Are you prepared
for closing argument?

35:42.619 --> 35:45.721
Absolutely.

35:45.756 --> 35:47.690
Then you're on.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.919
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:55.954 --> 35:58.155
I got to admit,

35:58.190 --> 36:00.858
uh, I'm a little buzzed.

36:03.429 --> 36:06.731
Let me tell you something
about...

36:09.167 --> 36:10.668
Danny Dubois?

36:10.702 --> 36:11.836
There it is.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.270
I've known Double D...

36:13.305 --> 36:14.738
since we were in high school,

36:14.773 --> 36:16.874
and back then,
he was the type of guy

36:16.909 --> 36:19.376
who showered
with the cheerleaders,

36:19.411 --> 36:21.612
one of whom was my girlfriend!

36:21.646 --> 36:23.747
Which is relevant <i>how?</i>

36:23.781 --> 36:26.483
I'll tell you how.

36:27.218 --> 36:28.852
See, I was still pissed

36:28.886 --> 36:31.721
when we took on this case,
because I just assumed

36:31.755 --> 36:33.522
Danny was the same dick

36:33.557 --> 36:35.424
who snaked my girl
back in high school.

36:35.459 --> 36:37.560
Then I thought
he was just a loser

36:37.594 --> 36:39.395
when I found out
he was sleeping

36:39.429 --> 36:41.697
on his grandmother's couch
because he lost his job.

36:41.731 --> 36:42.765
Can <i>i</i> object?

36:42.799 --> 36:44.100
I'm afraid not.

36:44.134 --> 36:46.903
But I was wrong.

36:46.937 --> 36:49.539
That sounded like
when Fonzie says he's wrong,

36:49.574 --> 36:51.041
and he can't say it.

36:51.076 --> 36:52.109
Wr-r--

36:52.143 --> 36:53.945
sorry.

36:53.979 --> 36:56.848
Geez, how could he be a loser
if he liked

36:56.882 --> 36:58.684
taking care of his grandmother
and her friends?

36:58.718 --> 37:00.886
And how could he be a dick

37:00.920 --> 37:02.221
if he tried to save
an ex-teammate

37:02.255 --> 37:03.656
from a bar fight?

37:03.690 --> 37:09.194
I wouldn't call that person
a loser or a dick.

37:09.229 --> 37:12.164
I would call that man...

37:12.199 --> 37:15.067
a friend.

37:18.872 --> 37:21.941
Danny was sober when he jumped
in the golf cart,

37:21.975 --> 37:23.743
raced through a golf course,

37:23.777 --> 37:25.078
and across a city street.

37:25.112 --> 37:27.247
Now, is it a bad idea
and against the law

37:27.282 --> 37:29.350
to get behind the wheel
intoxicated?

37:29.384 --> 37:30.451
Yeah.

37:30.485 --> 37:33.488
But getting behind
the wheel sober --

37:33.522 --> 37:36.324
sober? No.

37:36.359 --> 37:39.194
No. No!

37:39.229 --> 37:41.330
It's not!

37:43.800 --> 37:45.134
Period.

37:45.168 --> 37:46.702
-Mr. Franklin?
-Yo.

37:46.736 --> 37:48.537
Are you done?

37:48.571 --> 37:50.539
Uh...

37:50.573 --> 37:52.807
Like a fox, your honor.

37:54.276 --> 37:57.478
Thanks for listenin'.

37:57.512 --> 38:00.614
Thank you, Peter.

38:00.648 --> 38:02.182
Good luck.

38:13.229 --> 38:14.696
Let me in.

38:14.731 --> 38:16.231
No.

38:16.265 --> 38:18.500
When I find out
what the two of you did --

38:18.535 --> 38:20.269
and trust me, I will --

38:20.303 --> 38:22.338
I'm gonna turn
your nut sac into my coin purse.

38:22.372 --> 38:24.040
I know you're saying
all kinds of threatening things,

38:24.074 --> 38:25.407
but I'm just picturing you naked
right now.

38:26.476 --> 38:27.876
What's going on?

38:27.910 --> 38:29.811
What are you doing here?
Where's your organ monkey?

38:29.845 --> 38:32.180
Uh, Jared is running late.

38:34.116 --> 38:35.916
Stanton.

38:35.951 --> 38:37.151
What's happening?

38:37.185 --> 38:39.286
He won't let me see my client.

38:39.320 --> 38:41.588
He won't let us
see <i>our</i> client.

38:41.622 --> 38:42.889
Oh.

38:42.923 --> 38:43.957
Well, will you let <i>me</i> see?

38:43.991 --> 38:44.925
Absolutely.

38:44.959 --> 38:46.093
Oh, thank you.

38:46.127 --> 38:47.628
Oh.

38:47.662 --> 38:49.029
Mm.

38:49.063 --> 38:51.365
After I couldn't,
you know...

38:51.399 --> 38:52.700
make it work with you,

38:52.734 --> 38:54.569
I panicked.

38:54.603 --> 38:57.038
I thought maybe I was bored
with marriage sex,

38:57.073 --> 38:59.374
and I-I thought
another woman

38:59.409 --> 39:02.411
might do the trick --
but it didn't.

39:02.446 --> 39:04.647
I'm trying to fix everything
by myself.

39:04.681 --> 39:06.748
No Viagra, no therapy --

39:06.783 --> 39:11.119
Because you have
to do everything solo.

39:11.153 --> 39:12.920
Admit no weakness?

39:12.955 --> 39:16.723
Well...

39:16.758 --> 39:18.525
I am now.

39:20.427 --> 39:22.361
And I will tear up that prenup

39:22.396 --> 39:24.996
if you just give me
another chance.

39:25.031 --> 39:26.698
Jump on it.

39:26.733 --> 39:28.300
It's a great deal.

39:28.334 --> 39:29.968
This is a teaching moment...

39:30.003 --> 39:31.837
...For us all.

39:38.445 --> 39:41.147
Teaching moment, indeed.

39:41.182 --> 39:43.617
Look, I am aware
sex has broken out

39:43.651 --> 39:46.820
between some of
the senior partners.

39:46.854 --> 39:50.191
Now, what do you think happens
when there's jealousy

39:50.225 --> 39:52.661
and sexual tension
in the workplace?

39:52.695 --> 39:54.196
Loss of concentration?

39:54.230 --> 39:56.465
And unprofessional conduct.

39:56.499 --> 39:58.066
-Mm.
-Yes!

39:58.101 --> 40:00.035
Actually, I was also thinking...

40:00.070 --> 40:01.804
Healthy competition.

40:01.838 --> 40:04.674
I mean, you cocks,
you strut around the place

40:04.708 --> 40:05.975
trying to impress the hen.

40:06.009 --> 40:07.777
I mean, more inspired work
gets done.

40:07.811 --> 40:09.379
It's fantastic!

40:09.413 --> 40:12.716
And, Peter, why don't you
hook up with somebody here?

40:12.750 --> 40:17.887
I mean, Derek's wife --
she's quite lovely.

40:19.090 --> 40:20.357
Why don't you make a run at her?

40:20.391 --> 40:22.125
I'll --
I'll get right on that, sir.

40:22.160 --> 40:23.327
Oh.

40:23.361 --> 40:26.397
I got to get back to court.

40:34.172 --> 40:35.373
Wow.

40:35.407 --> 40:37.775
-Whoo!
-Very impressive.

40:37.809 --> 40:39.010
I <i>am</i> impressive.

40:39.044 --> 40:40.711
Nad!

40:40.746 --> 40:43.614
I don't know whether to
thank you or say "I'm sorry."

40:43.648 --> 40:46.584
You could say "Jared."

40:46.618 --> 40:48.752
- Jared.
-Yeah. Oh!

40:48.786 --> 40:51.621
I never showered
with your girlfriend.

40:51.656 --> 40:53.991
I showered
with Sara Armstrong.

40:55.593 --> 40:57.094
Peter's girlfriend?

40:57.128 --> 40:58.595
Hey!

40:58.630 --> 40:59.730
You did it!

40:59.764 --> 41:00.897
You're amazing! Ha ha!

41:00.932 --> 41:02.065
Hey, Danny.

41:03.367 --> 41:06.169
I am gonna drink before
every closing from now on,

41:06.203 --> 41:07.937
like Paul Newman
in -- in "The Verdict."

41:07.971 --> 41:09.438
You all right, Hermano?

41:09.472 --> 41:11.039
Four beers in four minutes
is a lot!

41:11.074 --> 41:13.008
Four beers in four minutes,

41:13.042 --> 41:15.343
plus a 12-inch hoagie --
<i>that's</i> a lot.

41:23.752 --> 41:25.552
Ugh.

41:25.587 --> 41:26.720
Oh, God.

41:26.755 --> 41:28.222
Oh, God.

41:28.256 --> 41:29.923
Oh, don't go!
Don't go! Aah!

41:29.958 --> 41:31.625
Oh, God!

41:31.660 --> 41:33.461
Ohh,
I don't like it, Peter.
