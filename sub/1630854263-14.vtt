WEBVTT

00:15.283 --> 00:16.417
Hey, y'all.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.951
Hey.
Hey, Pop,

00:18.052 --> 00:20.754
have you, uh, driven
by the Pit Stop lately?

00:20.854 --> 00:23.291
No. I got better
things to do.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.626
You drove by it yesterday.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.830
"Lately" means "today," Tina.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.566
And I only
go that way

00:32.666 --> 00:34.435
because the gas station
with the best hot dogs

00:34.535 --> 00:36.437
is right across the street.

00:37.605 --> 00:38.906
Right. Uh...

00:39.006 --> 00:41.342
Pop, you know, it's natural
for you to be curious

00:41.442 --> 00:42.576
about what they're doing
to the place.

00:42.676 --> 00:43.777
Well, I'm not.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.779
Okay. Well,
just so you know,

00:45.879 --> 00:47.815
the sign says
it's opening today.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.016
It is?

00:49.117 --> 00:50.084
Yeah.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.052
Well, I wish them luck.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.423
I wonder
how much they changed it.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.158
Why would they change it?

00:57.258 --> 01:00.294
They bought it because it's
the best mechanic shop in town.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.163
Yeah, well,
I'm just saying, Pop,

01:02.263 --> 01:04.598
if you want to check it out,
there is no shame.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.767
I don't want to check it out!

01:08.636 --> 01:10.871
But what I <i>would</i> like to do

01:10.971 --> 01:14.275
is take my lovely wife out
for a nice lunch.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.809
Oh.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.978
You know, I got a taste
for one of those hot dogs.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.713
Come on, Tina.

01:19.813 --> 01:24.285
So your idea of a nice lunch
is a gas station hot dog?

01:24.385 --> 01:25.719
Really?

01:25.819 --> 01:28.222
Just because we came into
a little money, Tina,

01:28.322 --> 01:30.258
we can't forget
where we came from.

01:30.358 --> 01:32.226
Okay. I'm sorry.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.627
I would love to.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.463
I mean, yeah,
who wouldn't want a hot dog

01:35.563 --> 01:38.466
that's been rolling underneath
a heat lamp for two days?

01:39.667 --> 01:43.404
But, please, please, can we stop
by to see the new Pit Stop?

01:43.504 --> 01:46.740
And I know you don't want to,
but I'm not as strong as you.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.642
Fine.
Okay.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.244
You see what you
did, Malcolm?

01:50.344 --> 01:52.079
Now your mama making me go.

02:00.988 --> 02:03.624
What in the
world is this?

02:03.724 --> 02:05.393
Are we being punk'd?

02:06.527 --> 02:08.329
Welcome to Calvin's Pit Stop.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.231
This ain't Calvin's Pit Stop.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.965
Yes, it is.

02:12.065 --> 02:13.434
Would you like to see
a food menu

02:13.534 --> 02:15.436
or are we just gonna top off
your fluids today?

02:15.536 --> 02:16.604
Hold on.

02:16.704 --> 02:17.938
What'd you say to my wife?
Uh...

02:18.038 --> 02:20.774
No. No, no, no, no.
Cal-Cal-Calvin,

02:20.874 --> 02:22.410
he's talking
about beer.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.378
This-this is
a brewery now.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.447
Oh, my God.

02:26.547 --> 02:27.981
You're the guy!

02:31.485 --> 02:33.053
Oh, hell nah!

02:33.221 --> 02:35.088
Hey! Everybody!

02:35.223 --> 02:36.557
Calvin's here!

02:36.657 --> 02:38.125
No, he's not!

02:40.428 --> 02:42.496
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:42.596 --> 02:44.031
♪ Welcome to the hood. ♪

02:48.068 --> 02:50.070
I mean, how am I supposed
to look at this menu

02:50.238 --> 02:53.073
with this grinning
idiot all over it?

02:53.841 --> 02:55.709
It's not so bad.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.545
He's kind of cute.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.046
I don't want to be cute.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.748
I mean, I mean,
I <i>am</i> cute,

03:00.848 --> 03:03.417
but I don't want them
using my cuteness

03:03.517 --> 03:08.121
to sell "artesianal"
squash blossom flatbread.

03:08.256 --> 03:11.124
Why don't they just say
"nasty pizza"?

03:12.326 --> 03:13.861
Ooh, and-and
look at this one.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.128
"Calvin's Favorite:

03:15.263 --> 03:18.766
"bison truffle sliders
with manchego

03:18.866 --> 03:20.100
and watercress."

03:20.268 --> 03:22.803
Who told them that
was <i>my</i> favorite?

03:22.903 --> 03:24.305
I don't know what
half those things are,

03:24.405 --> 03:25.573
and I hate
the other half.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.007
Mm.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.743
Well, how did this
happen? I mean,

03:29.843 --> 03:31.812
the developers didn't say
anything about this,

03:31.912 --> 03:33.180
did they?
No.

03:33.281 --> 03:35.283
When they said they
wanted to keep the name,

03:35.283 --> 03:38.686
I just assumed it was
gonna stay a repair shop.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.688
Tell you what,
my old customers,

03:40.788 --> 03:42.356
they're gonna
be pissed.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.525
Ooh!

03:44.625 --> 03:47.661
They have nachos
in a hubcap.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.530
How stupid is that?

03:52.733 --> 03:55.503
I'm telling you, there's nothing
in this contract that says

03:55.603 --> 03:58.872
the new owners have the right to
make me look like a damn fool.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.675
Well, your lawyer reviewed it.
What-what did he say?

04:01.775 --> 04:02.876
I don't know, Dave.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.478
If I understood a lawyer,

04:04.578 --> 04:05.746
I wouldn't need a lawyer.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.319
Who wants to take
a fun online test?

04:11.419 --> 04:12.586
Ooh!

04:12.686 --> 04:13.587
Not me.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.323
Wha...

04:15.423 --> 04:18.459
Come on! It's really cool.
It's this career aptitude test.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.027
I got our school
to sign up for it.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.529
It asks the kids
a bunch of questions

04:21.629 --> 04:23.497
about their personality type
and their interests

04:23.597 --> 04:25.633
and tells them what kind
of career they might have.

04:25.733 --> 04:26.834
Okay.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.337
Well, I thought
grades did that.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.339
See, that's the
kind of thinking

04:31.339 --> 04:32.906
that keeps kids
from dreaming big.

04:33.006 --> 04:35.042
Yeah. You know, Grover thinks
he's gonna be an NBA star,

04:35.142 --> 04:36.109
but this will give him more...

04:36.209 --> 04:39.413
Skills?
Coordination? Height?

04:40.981 --> 04:43.016
More great options.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.852
Oh.
Okay, can we stop talking
about the test?

04:44.952 --> 04:46.253
I'm fighting for my life here!

04:46.354 --> 04:47.688
Yeah.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.857
Calvin's right.
Let's focus.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.359
But, FYI, Grover's got skills.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.726
You should see him take
a charge.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.363
He can stand still
like nobody's business.

04:57.164 --> 04:59.867
Look, my lawyer said that
they were buying the property

04:59.967 --> 05:02.403
and the rights
to my name. That's it.

05:02.503 --> 05:05.806
I would've never allowed them to
mock me as a cartoon character.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.409
Well, I'm taking
my image back.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.177
I'm suing their asses. Ooh,

05:10.277 --> 05:11.745
wait, I don't think
you can, baby.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.081
It says here that
any contract disputes

05:14.181 --> 05:16.116
are required to
go to mediation.

05:16.216 --> 05:19.086
Ooh. You are
in luck,

05:19.186 --> 05:21.389
since you happen
to know a trained

05:21.389 --> 05:24.525
and licensed
conflict mediator.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.927
I don't care
about trained and licensed.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.228
What will it cost?

05:28.396 --> 05:30.030
Oh, Calvin,
are you kidding me?

05:30.130 --> 05:31.599
I'd pay you
to let me do it.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.100
How much would you pay me?

05:46.046 --> 05:47.247
Hey, check it out!

05:47.415 --> 05:48.582
I got a keytar.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.484
Yeah. Uh,
Marty, mm,

05:50.584 --> 05:52.085
are you having a post-breakup

05:52.185 --> 05:53.554
"what am I doing with my life?"
freak-out?

05:53.654 --> 05:56.056
No, no! This isn't
a freak-out keytar.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.125
Although my skills
may freak you out.

06:01.829 --> 06:02.830
Yeah, that's a no.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.332
Come on, man. I always
wanted to learn to play,

06:05.433 --> 06:06.534
and now's the
perfect time.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.201
How 'bout when
I'm not here?

06:08.301 --> 06:10.438
Well, get used to it.

06:10.438 --> 06:12.005
The new Marty's
taking initiative,

06:12.105 --> 06:13.441
starting
with my job.

06:13.441 --> 06:14.875
You know the Venus explorer
we're working on?

06:14.975 --> 06:16.309
No.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.546
Well, you know how Venus
has a toxic atmosphere?

06:18.646 --> 06:19.747
No.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.682
Okay.

06:21.782 --> 06:22.983
You know
how you can use a balloon

06:23.083 --> 06:24.618
to collect samples
above Venus's surface?

06:24.718 --> 06:27.821
Okay, Marty, uh, what was it
about my last two answers

06:27.921 --> 06:30.190
that made you think
I would know that?

06:30.290 --> 06:33.461
Anyway, I've been waiting
for the perfect time

06:33.461 --> 06:34.862
to pitch this idea at JPL.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.464
And then going through
this breakup with Necie

06:36.464 --> 06:37.765
has given me
a lot of time to think.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.266
And I realized

06:39.366 --> 06:41.368
now's the time
to take chances.

06:41.469 --> 06:43.036
And guess what else.
What?

06:43.136 --> 06:45.038
I learned the beginning of
the <i>Quantum Leap</i> theme song.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.173
No, you didn't.
Yeah, I did.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.140
Hold on. Check it out. No.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.175
Marty,

06:48.275 --> 06:49.242
you don't need to...
W-Wait.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.611
I-I don't...
No, look.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.713
No, hold on.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.648
Wait. Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.349
No.

06:56.484 --> 06:57.885
Damn it. I lost it.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.657
I just got the results of
Grover's career aptitude test.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.892
Oh.
They are not good.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.327
Uh-oh. Hold on.
Let me see.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.497
"Independent. Self-starter.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.131
Focused and methodical."

07:11.231 --> 07:12.533
This doesn't sound so bad.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.401
Look at the career they say
he's best suited for.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.369
Lighthouse keeper.

07:19.372 --> 07:20.307
Okay.

07:20.407 --> 07:21.909
You know, on the plus side,

07:22.009 --> 07:23.911
we can stop investing
in his college fund.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.615
What's that?
Oh.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.282
Your career aptitude test
came back.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.984
Ooh! Come on, NBA.

07:31.084 --> 07:34.688
I'm not against playing
overseas, but, you know,

07:34.788 --> 07:36.957
it wouldn't be my first choice.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.392
Some great players got
their start in Greece,

07:39.527 --> 07:41.228
so let's keep an open mind.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.030
Dave!

07:44.131 --> 07:46.667
The-the test said
some really good things. Yeah.

07:46.767 --> 07:50.203
It says that you're
an independent self-starter.
Mm-hmm.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.405
That sounds like me.
Pretty good test.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.576
Huh.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.811
Looks like the fog's rolling in.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.787
He's right!
Oh!

08:10.023 --> 08:11.925
Okay, so the inner balloon
would be rigid

08:12.025 --> 08:13.761
and filled
with pressurized helium

08:13.861 --> 08:16.396
that we could release as needed
into the outer balloon,

08:16.564 --> 08:18.666
controlling the buoyancy
without thrusters.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.101
So, as the balloon rises,

08:21.201 --> 08:24.104
so does our understanding
of Venus's atmosphere.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.105
Wow.
Ooh.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.574
Wow!

08:26.574 --> 08:28.241
That is some great
outside-the-box thinking.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.977
I'm very impressed.

08:30.077 --> 08:33.080
And so many balloon puns.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.582
Yes, thank you.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.449
I wanted to make sure
my presentation really...

08:36.584 --> 08:37.450
popped.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.287
Oh! Another!

08:40.387 --> 08:41.354
Good, good stuff.

08:41.454 --> 08:42.823
I love seeing that passion.

08:42.923 --> 08:43.891
Mm-hmm.

08:43.991 --> 08:44.992
Anyway, they moved up
the deadline

08:45.092 --> 08:46.093
for our progress report,

08:46.193 --> 08:47.494
so we just got to...

08:49.096 --> 08:50.263
Can-can we back up a sec?

08:50.363 --> 08:51.732
It seems like
you're just moving on.

08:51.832 --> 08:52.833
From what?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.868
From my brilliantly
researched idea.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.671
Right! No,
it was great work.
Mm-hmm.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.607
Um, so innovative.
Mm-hmm.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.675
Anyway, uh, we need to
get all the data in to me

09:01.775 --> 09:03.243
as soon as possible. Okay.

09:03.343 --> 09:04.377
All right. Uh, okay,

09:04.477 --> 09:06.379
I-I see what
you're doing here.

09:06.479 --> 09:07.681
You're blowing me off.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.049
After I went through
the trouble of composing

09:09.149 --> 09:11.985
an original keytar score
for my presentation.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.655
Marty, I love your
idea, and I...

09:14.755 --> 09:16.389
I <i>loved</i> that score.

09:16.489 --> 09:17.958
It was haunting.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.628
Okay? You are...
You're-you're a rock star.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.696
But you're not gonna do
anything with it.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.331
N-Not at this juncture, no.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.767
O-Okay.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.301
Look around you, Pat.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.504
This room is filled

09:31.639 --> 09:33.941
with some of the greatest
minds in the world,

09:34.041 --> 09:35.743
and we're not gonna keep
bringing you innovative ideas

09:35.843 --> 09:37.477
if we think it's pointless.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.546
Fortune favors the bold.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.749
And <i>we</i> are bold.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.283
And we cannot-- nay,

09:43.383 --> 09:44.484
nay--

09:44.652 --> 09:46.687
we will not

09:46.787 --> 09:48.756
be taking this anymore.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.258
Who's with me?!

09:53.761 --> 09:56.129
So are you saying
we'd, like, quit?

09:56.229 --> 09:58.732
No, no, no, no.
Not-not-not quit, per se,

09:58.832 --> 09:59.900
but we won't be working.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.901
Uh...

10:01.001 --> 10:02.903
You-you can't stop working.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.905
I know. Okay.

10:05.005 --> 10:08.175
Okay, we <i>will</i> be working, but...

10:08.275 --> 10:10.978
we just--
we just won't be taking this.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.682
I'm kind of losing the
sense of what "this" is.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.526
Hi. I'm Ingrid Katay. I'll be
representing Thaxton Capital,

10:26.626 --> 10:27.861
the owners of the Pit Stop.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.496
It's so nice to meet
you. I'm Dave John...

10:29.596 --> 10:30.530
Uh, Dave,

10:30.630 --> 10:31.531
what are you doing?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.166
That's the enemy.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.870
Calvin, this is
a mediation.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.439
The whole point is
there are no enemies.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.709
And you must be Mr. Butler.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.176
How are you today, sir?

10:43.276 --> 10:45.713
Wouldn't you like to know?

10:47.214 --> 10:49.349
Good afternoon!

10:49.449 --> 10:51.218
I'm Judge Fred Lampin, retired,

10:51.318 --> 10:53.220
and I'll be presiding
over this mediation.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.955
It's nice to meet you, Your
Honor. I'm Dave Johnson.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.123
This is
Calvin Butler.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.825
Good afternoon,
Your Honor.

10:57.925 --> 11:01.161
And I must say, you look
very judgmental today.

11:02.362 --> 11:05.365
You know,
I watch all the judge shows,

11:05.465 --> 11:06.834
and, I got to say,

11:06.934 --> 11:09.002
I can't believe
you don't have one.

11:09.102 --> 11:12.873
Those shows make a mockery
of the judicial system.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.978
That's why I tell my wife
to turn them shows off.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.416
Hey, Emelia.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.617
Thanks for getting
the gang together.

11:24.752 --> 11:25.886
It was a rough day.

11:25.986 --> 11:26.754
No.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.421
Come sit
next to me.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.923
Oh. Ah...

11:30.023 --> 11:32.159
You don't want to sit
next to Derek. I get it.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.761
I get it.

11:33.761 --> 11:34.962
I don't know
about you,

11:35.062 --> 11:36.764
but I really
needed a drink. Mmm.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.531
I applied the
Tsiolkovsky equation

11:38.631 --> 11:39.833
so many times today,

11:39.933 --> 11:41.234
my cortex
was about to melt.

11:41.334 --> 11:44.437
Yeah, I've been there.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.438
Listen,

11:45.538 --> 11:47.074
I was really taken

11:47.174 --> 11:48.441
with what you
said earlier.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.377
Thank you. Thank you.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.479
You know, I put so much thought
into that presentation.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.481
The thing that I find most
interesting about Venus is...

11:54.581 --> 11:56.349
I don't care about Venus.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.819
That's just
an insane thing to say.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.990
The way you spoke to Pat,

12:03.090 --> 12:06.293
it was so... bold.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.594
Hmm.

12:07.694 --> 12:09.329
I've never seen
anyone at work

12:09.429 --> 12:11.331
be so passionate.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.801
They're all just really
uncomfortable and awkward.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.105
I can't even
remember the last time

12:18.205 --> 12:21.174
I made eye contact
with someone at work.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.947
Ain't nobody else coming.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.819
You inspired me, Marty.

12:31.919 --> 12:35.022
To be bold, to take chances.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.623
And now we're here.

12:36.723 --> 12:37.891
Yeah.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.227
Do you want to
take a chance, too?

12:40.327 --> 12:41.461
Well, I...

12:43.030 --> 12:45.065
Oh, all right.
Whoa, whoa.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.166
That's not
a good idea.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.835
That's not what
your lips said.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.069
My lips weren't
saying anything because

12:49.169 --> 12:50.403
your teeth were on them.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.675
Your Honor, you've
read the contract.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.344
It is right there
in black and white.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.848
Clearly, the large sum
of money we paid Mr. Butler

13:00.848 --> 13:03.016
has given him
plenty of free time,

13:03.116 --> 13:04.952
which he's now
using to waste ours.

13:05.052 --> 13:06.319
You see?

13:06.419 --> 13:08.956
I told you not to be
friendly with her.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.925
It's frivolous.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.626
You're frivolous. Okay.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.129
I-I think we need

13:16.229 --> 13:17.998
to lower the
temperature here.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.233
Your Honor, with
all due respect,

13:20.333 --> 13:21.902
the sum my client
was paid

13:22.002 --> 13:23.636
is not
the issue here.

13:23.736 --> 13:24.872
He feels like
they are

13:24.872 --> 13:26.940
using his image
in bad faith.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.608
Okay, if I may

13:28.708 --> 13:32.379
draw Your Honor's attention
to page 18 of the agreement.

13:38.886 --> 13:41.188
Mr. Butler relinquished

13:41.288 --> 13:42.923
all rights to
the name and likeness

13:43.023 --> 13:44.724
associated
with Calvin's Pitstop.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.260
Is this your
signature, Mr. Butler?

13:47.360 --> 13:49.596
Yes, it is,
Your Honor,

13:49.696 --> 13:50.931
but you have
to understand,

13:51.031 --> 13:54.434
it was next to a very
large check at the time.

13:55.802 --> 13:59.439
So your legal argument
is you got distracted?

13:59.539 --> 14:02.775
More like seduced,
Your Honor.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.014
Calvin, please, I'm
the professional here.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.081
Let me do my job.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.282
But you're
not doing anything.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.583
Well, you're not
letting me talk.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.819
Your Honor,
what are we doing here?

14:12.920 --> 14:15.055
Judge, can I see you
in chambers?

14:16.924 --> 14:20.127
I don't have chambers.
We're in an office building.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.162
There's a dentist
across the hall.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.398
Okay, Your Honor,

14:25.498 --> 14:28.735
then I'll say this in
front of this rude lady.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.406
This caricature
of me is defamatory.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.808
It looks nothing like me.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.214
I agree.
Thank you.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.815
And if it looks
nothing like him,

14:42.950 --> 14:45.152
by definition,
it can't be defamatory.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.486
Wait... Wait...

14:46.586 --> 14:48.121
Wait a minute.
That's not what I meant.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.622
I'm inclined to agree.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.691
And combined with
the wording in the contract,

14:51.791 --> 14:54.194
it's an easy decision
to allow the current owners

14:54.294 --> 14:57.097
of Calvin's Pitstop to
continue use of the name

14:57.197 --> 14:58.398
and image.

14:58.498 --> 14:59.732
I think we're done here.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.068
Wait... No,

15:01.168 --> 15:02.102
I appeal!

15:02.202 --> 15:04.271
I'm taking this to the top.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.874
You mean the Planet Fitness
on the third floor?

15:11.178 --> 15:13.280
I don't like her.
I know.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.049
You know, sometimes
I wonder what

15:16.149 --> 15:17.517
I'm even still
doing at JPL.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.652
Nobody cared about my idea.

15:19.752 --> 15:20.887
Except Emelia.

15:20.988 --> 15:22.789
But then, that
gave her other ideas.

15:22.889 --> 15:25.358
You know what
would drive her away?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.727
Hmm?
Bust out your keytar.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.497
Man, Prince played keytar.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.266
Did he turn women off?
You are not Prince.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.634
Please, please, please!
Finish the test.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.603
Gemma, is it really necessary

15:36.703 --> 15:38.371
that everyone take this test?

15:38.471 --> 15:39.839
Uh, yes, because you took it,

15:40.007 --> 15:41.341
and it said that
you should have a career

15:41.441 --> 15:43.076
in music and teaching.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.411
It nailed you.

15:44.511 --> 15:45.712
So I'm going to keep
making people take it

15:45.812 --> 15:47.447
until I can prove
that it's stupid.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.716
And I'm done.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.351
Okay, come on, be wrong,
be wrong, be wrong, be wrong.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.852
Aerospace engineer.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.221
Damn it!

15:55.622 --> 15:56.723
I mean, technically,
my degree is in...

15:56.823 --> 15:58.258
Oh, spare me,
Marty. Malcolm?

15:58.358 --> 16:01.128
Huh? Uh, well,
I got, uh...

16:01.228 --> 16:03.030
...mushroom farmer.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.132
You did?
Yeah.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.333
No, you didn't.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.101
No, uh...

16:08.901 --> 16:11.371
Yeah, you're right.
I got sports management.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.639
Oh, crap.

16:12.739 --> 16:15.408
Gemma, you can't
take this so seriously.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.543
Worst case scenario,

16:16.643 --> 16:18.045
Grover's a
lighthouse keeper.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.247
That's a
terrible scenario.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.615
He'd be alone
in a tower

16:22.715 --> 16:24.917
flipping
a light switch.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.555
Well, what happened
to all that stuff about

16:28.655 --> 16:30.390
letting kids be
whatever they want to be?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.459
Oh, please, that's for
other people's kids.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.097
I-I don't want
to be here.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.565
Calvin, come on.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.766
You wouldn't
let me mediate,

16:39.866 --> 16:41.068
so at least let me help you

16:41.068 --> 16:42.069
work through your feelings.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.370
Now,

16:43.470 --> 16:46.673
this is called
exposure therapy, so...

16:46.773 --> 16:49.076
let's expose ourselves.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.344
Say what?

16:51.444 --> 16:53.846
Calvin, what
is it about this place

16:53.946 --> 16:54.981
that's so upsetting?

16:55.082 --> 16:56.683
Everything.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.952
All right, can you be
a little more specific?

17:01.088 --> 17:02.689
I used to walk into this room,

17:02.789 --> 17:04.924
and I was the most
important person here.

17:05.092 --> 17:08.095
Everybody needed me.
Now look at me.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.299
Welcome to Calvin's.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.901
Can I offer you an IPA?

17:16.603 --> 17:20.107
Calvin, they are
not mocking you.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.110
They're celebrating you.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.679
This place is called
Calvin's because

17:26.779 --> 17:28.181
it is a name
that the community

17:28.281 --> 17:29.782
trusts and loves.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.252
And now you'll
be remembered.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.820
I mean, maybe
not in the way

17:33.920 --> 17:36.356
that you
would have chosen,

17:36.456 --> 17:37.424
but isn't it amazing

17:37.524 --> 17:39.126
just to be
remembered at all?

17:39.126 --> 17:41.128
I'm not dead, Dave.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.030
That's it. I'm leaving.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.732
Okay, no, wait, just...

17:45.832 --> 17:49.202
As a therapist, I've never said
this to a client before, but...

17:50.370 --> 17:51.704
I think you should have a beer.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.480
Hey, buddy.
What are you watching?

18:00.580 --> 18:01.548
<i>SpongeBob.</i>

18:01.648 --> 18:03.250
Of course.

18:05.818 --> 18:06.719
Can we talk
for a sec?

18:06.819 --> 18:08.054
Yeah, sure.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.823
I don't want you
to ever feel like

18:10.923 --> 18:12.525
I'm going to be disappointed

18:12.625 --> 18:14.161
if you follow
your own path in life.

18:14.261 --> 18:16.163
No matter what you become,
when you grow up,

18:16.263 --> 18:19.566
the only thing that matters
is that you're happy.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.568
Is this about that career test?

18:21.668 --> 18:23.303
Yeah.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.938
And even if you
end up doing something

18:26.038 --> 18:29.242
from the olden days
that you didn't even know

18:29.342 --> 18:30.477
was, like, still a thing,

18:30.577 --> 18:32.679
uh...

18:32.779 --> 18:35.748
Your dad and I will support you.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.718
Mom, I have to
confess something.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.688
I just filled in random
answers on that test.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.723
You did? Why?

18:43.823 --> 18:46.025
Well, you made us
take a test

18:46.193 --> 18:49.196
at lunch. It was cutting
into my kickball time.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.999
Oh, thank God you're
not a lighthouse keeper.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.737
No, Mom, I told you,

18:57.837 --> 18:59.939
I'm going to the NBA.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.376
Ooh, nothing but net.

19:06.045 --> 19:09.249
Oh, I love that sweet,
delusional child.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.355
See, this place
isn't so bad, right?

19:15.455 --> 19:16.656
Yeah, it's okay.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.625
And I guess a beer
is a beer,

19:18.725 --> 19:21.461
no matter how
stupid the name is.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.563
Here you go, Calvin.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.232
Two Sticky
Piston pilsners.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.100
On the house.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.069
Why?

19:30.237 --> 19:32.239
Come on, man. You're a legend.

19:32.339 --> 19:35.908
You used to fix
my dad's car. '78 Jag?

19:37.109 --> 19:38.845
Oh, yeah.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.248
Cheetah seat covers,
with a million miles on it.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.249
You got it.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.251
I made a grip off his dad.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.788
Still runs great. You hungry?

19:48.888 --> 19:50.523
How about a Calvin's Favorite?

19:50.623 --> 19:51.891
Okay, you know what?

19:51.991 --> 19:53.460
Here's the thing
about the Calvin's Favorite.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.262
It's not Calvin's favorite.

19:56.062 --> 19:57.897
If you're going to make
a dish with my name on it,

19:57.997 --> 20:00.400
it should be something
I'd actually eat.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.134
Like a gas station hot dog.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.304
Ah.

20:04.404 --> 20:05.638
Let me talk to the chef.

20:05.738 --> 20:06.873
Maybe he could put a spin on it.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.208
Okay, that's what
I'm talking about.

20:10.142 --> 20:10.943
You know,
Dave's Faves

20:11.043 --> 20:12.779
would be
scallops, but...

20:12.879 --> 20:14.881
Nobody's talking
about Dave's Fave.

20:16.649 --> 20:17.984
Uh, Calvin?

20:18.084 --> 20:19.352
Yeah?

20:19.452 --> 20:21.688
We just want to say
we love your place.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.523
Well, you know,

20:23.623 --> 20:26.259
it's not my place, per se, but,

20:26.359 --> 20:27.760
uh...

20:27.860 --> 20:31.331
You know, it wouldn't
be here if it weren't for me,

20:31.431 --> 20:34.267
so, I guess you can
argue it's mine.

20:35.635 --> 20:36.669
Hey, everybody,

20:36.769 --> 20:38.605
a toast to the original Calvin.

20:40.407 --> 20:43.042
I think my work
here is done.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.445
Uh, can I get a selfie?

20:45.545 --> 20:46.979
Sure.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.047
You know...

20:48.147 --> 20:49.949
...I don't
normally do this,

20:50.049 --> 20:52.018
but, uh, hey, everybody,

20:52.118 --> 20:54.421
get out your phones.
