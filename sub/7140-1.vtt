00:26.844 --> 00:30.280
Be very very quiet.
I’m hunting rabbits.

00:36.820 --> 00:40.313
I am a duck bent on
self- preservationum.

00:42.861 --> 00:46.353
Say your prayers, rabbit.
It's rabbit season.

00:46.664 --> 00:49.360
- Duck season.
- Rabbit season!

00:53.538 --> 00:54.903
Duck season! Fire!

01:07.419 --> 01:09.010
Hold everything.

01:09.187 --> 01:12.555
''Daffy gets blasted.''
Page 7: ''Daffy gets blasted.''

01:13.091 --> 01:15.821
Page 8: ''Daffy gets blasted again! ''

01:15.894 --> 01:20.059
What's the matter with you people?
We can't do this kind of stuff anymore.

01:20.166 --> 01:21.531
Brothers Warner...

01:21.600 --> 01:25.229
show biz legends like me
shouldn't have to play stooge...

01:25.337 --> 01:28.204
to that long- eared,
carrot- chomping, overbite- challenged- -

01:28.941 --> 01:30.238
What's up, doc?

01:32.577 --> 01:34.239
Bobby, how's the wife?

01:34.346 --> 01:37.110
Great nose job, Chuck. Thanks, girls.

01:37.216 --> 01:39.844
Good rug, Mel. Never would have guessed.

01:40.452 --> 01:42.716
- Pardon me.
- The pleasure is mine.

01:42.788 --> 01:46.383
Fellas, I think Daff's right.
Maybe I'll take a vacation.

01:46.458 --> 01:48.926
Go visit my 542 nieces and nephews.

01:49.028 --> 01:50.928
Mr. Duck, excuse me, I’m sorry.

01:51.030 --> 01:55.057
I don't see how we can have a
Bugs Bunny movie without Bugs Bunny.

01:55.134 --> 01:56.727
Oh, my heavens, no.

01:56.803 --> 01:59.363
You couldn't have a movie
without Bugs Bunny.

01:59.438 --> 02:03.637
If you don't mind me asking, whose
glorified personal assistant are you?

02:03.742 --> 02:06.610
Kate Houghton, Vice President, Comedy.

02:07.147 --> 02:08.306
Right.

02:08.582 --> 02:10.241
<i>Kate did Lethal Weapon Babies.</i>

02:10.316 --> 02:13.980
<i>Finally, a Lethal Weapon
that I can take my grandchildren to.</i>

02:14.421 --> 02:15.978
Gentlemen, check your phones.

02:16.089 --> 02:19.616
Our latest research shows
that Bugs Bunny is a core asset...

02:19.725 --> 02:23.992
that appeals to male and female,
young and old throughout the universe...

02:24.097 --> 02:27.260
while your fan base
is limited to angry fat guys in basements.

02:27.334 --> 02:32.271
Yeah, but.... Come on, fellas,
I’m thrice the entertainer the rabbit is!

02:35.776 --> 02:37.299
Fine, it's hilarious...

02:37.411 --> 02:40.607
but moviegoers these days
demand action heroes, like me!

02:48.121 --> 02:49.748
Top that, rabbit.

02:55.096 --> 02:57.257
So, it has come to this, has it?

02:57.331 --> 02:59.765
I’m afraid
the Brothers Warner must choose...

02:59.834 --> 03:01.631
between a handsome matinee idol...

03:01.702 --> 03:05.364
or this miscreant perpetrator
of low burlesque.

03:07.375 --> 03:09.172
Whichever one's not the duck.

03:11.012 --> 03:13.174
That's the stuff from my office.

03:13.281 --> 03:15.681
- You don't have an office.
- Not anymore.

03:15.783 --> 03:17.546
Symbolically, this is bad.

03:17.819 --> 03:20.286
Please, brother. Other brother?

03:20.821 --> 03:23.221
Icy she- wolf? Help me, please.

03:23.958 --> 03:26.189
I’m too moist and tender to retire.

03:26.494 --> 03:28.553
- Let me escort you out.
- Wait!

03:28.664 --> 03:31.360
I haven't tried toadying, kowtowing,
or butt- kissing yet.

03:31.466 --> 03:33.457
I’m still begging here!

03:36.237 --> 03:37.500
Freeze!

03:52.154 --> 03:53.712
Can I try that again?

03:53.822 --> 03:56.552
No, thank you. We'll call you.

04:02.164 --> 04:04.689
Hey, D.J. How did your tryout go?

04:04.766 --> 04:08.600
Well, let's see.
I can say I made an impression.

04:09.037 --> 04:11.904
Your father can get you a job
anytime he wants to.

04:12.007 --> 04:15.238
I know, but I don't want that.
I'd really rather earn it, sir.

04:15.344 --> 04:19.178
- Mr. Warner mentioned you this morning.
- He did? What did he say?

04:19.248 --> 04:21.841
He said don't forget the TurtleWax.

04:23.585 --> 04:25.850
What about animation?
I could do cartoons.

04:25.921 --> 04:27.116
Dead duck walking.

04:27.223 --> 04:28.883
- Morning, Mr. Bunny.
- Very hot now.

04:28.957 --> 04:30.220
And I do voices. Listen.

04:30.293 --> 04:32.726
- Excuse me.
- ''Fetch the stick, boy.''

04:32.862 --> 04:35.922
''What a maroon.''
''You can't handle the truth.''

04:36.399 --> 04:37.889
Some grip, lady.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.192
I need you to eject this duck.

04:40.737 --> 04:42.932
- Lady, this is Daffy Duck.
- Exactly.

04:43.039 --> 04:44.802
- Not anymore. We own the name.
- Yeah?

04:44.907 --> 04:47.535
You can't stop me from calling myself....

04:48.211 --> 04:50.372
- What do you know?
- You fired Daffy Duck?

04:50.446 --> 04:52.812
No, I didn't. I did. They did.

04:52.982 --> 04:55.382
You just were following orders.

04:56.487 --> 04:58.954
You know what? You don't know me.

04:59.889 --> 05:03.290
You're Kate Houghton,
you're the VP of Comedy. Go figure.

05:03.394 --> 05:07.626
You drive a red 1988 Alfa Romeo.
Good engine. Little under- driven.

05:07.798 --> 05:11.289
I know this
because you nearly ran me over last week.

05:11.901 --> 05:15.394
Anyway, about that duck,
you want me to get rid of him still?

05:17.941 --> 05:20.432
- Duck, yes. Eject the duck, please.
- I can't do that.

05:20.511 --> 05:22.274
- Why not?
- He's gone.

05:27.785 --> 05:30.253
What are you waiting for, backup?

05:37.528 --> 05:39.826
Shabby job so far, constable.

05:40.431 --> 05:42.023
Quick! After me!

05:42.166 --> 05:45.431
Now you're gonna pay for that one.
Come here!

05:45.502 --> 05:47.630
- Dress Inspector!
- Look out!

05:47.704 --> 05:49.673
One side, Spartacuses.

05:52.943 --> 05:54.969
- Come on.
- Daffy, stop!

05:55.446 --> 05:57.437
Cut him off at the pass, boys.

05:57.881 --> 06:00.783
All units in pursuit of little black duck.

06:06.291 --> 06:08.122
Well, that's just cheating.

06:22.140 --> 06:23.664
Don't follow me.

06:28.714 --> 06:31.342
That's not right. Cut!

06:35.187 --> 06:36.916
<i>That's lunch, everybody!</i>

06:39.692 --> 06:42.717
- That airbag cost a lot of money.
- I’m okay.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.554
Good morning. Batman, you good?

06:46.665 --> 06:47.927
All right.

06:48.701 --> 06:50.430
My chariot awaits.

06:50.668 --> 06:51.930
Yes!

06:52.705 --> 06:55.333
Bat- lights. Bat- conditioning.
Bat- stereo.

06:56.242 --> 06:57.607
To the Duck Cave.

06:58.277 --> 06:59.767
Now what are you doing?

06:59.945 --> 07:02.345
Stay away from that Batmobile!

07:03.449 --> 07:07.044
- I’m allowed to steal. I’m a celebrity.
- Tell it to the judge!

07:07.888 --> 07:09.856
- Feeling pretty good about yourself?
- I am.

07:12.892 --> 07:15.360
- You bested that dastardly duck?
- I did.

07:16.696 --> 07:19.290
You're gonna offer your catch
to the pretty executive?

07:19.398 --> 07:20.422
Indeed.

07:22.702 --> 07:24.135
Miss Houghton!

07:32.144 --> 07:33.908
Get out of the way!

07:39.785 --> 07:40.877
Look out!

07:53.400 --> 07:55.596
What do you know? I found Nemo.

08:00.408 --> 08:02.272
I think she likes you.

08:11.452 --> 08:14.250
Your father would be so ashamed of you.

08:31.806 --> 08:33.831
But I was.... lt was....

08:38.511 --> 08:42.813
At first, they told me to lose the stutter.
Now they tell me I’m not funny.

08:42.883 --> 08:45.818
It's a pain in the butt
being politically correct.

08:45.886 --> 08:47.615
You're telling me.

08:48.190 --> 08:50.214
What kind of performance
do you call that?

08:50.325 --> 08:53.351
You made me sound
like a total space cadet, man.

08:53.462 --> 08:57.488
I’m sorry you feel that way.
I was trying to be real to your character.

08:57.565 --> 09:01.468
If you, like, goof on me in the sequel,
I’m coming after you.

09:01.536 --> 09:04.027
And I'll give you a Scooby Snack!

09:04.739 --> 09:07.708
There are some areas of the script
I think we need to address.

09:07.809 --> 09:11.039
There's no heart, no cooperation,
nobody learns anything.

09:11.146 --> 09:13.740
Daffy learns not to stick his head
in a jet engine.

09:13.849 --> 09:16.647
- He's gone.
- No, Daffy always comes back.

09:16.718 --> 09:18.583
I just tell him how much I need him.

09:18.687 --> 09:21.656
We hug, we cry,
I drop something heavy on him, I laugh.

09:21.723 --> 09:24.590
The duck is history, okay?
So the question is...

09:24.693 --> 09:28.754
how can I help you
reposition your brand identity?

09:29.531 --> 09:33.433
Answer: We team you up
with a hot female co- star.

09:33.602 --> 09:34.900
Usually...

09:35.203 --> 09:37.535
I play the female love interest.

09:40.376 --> 09:44.368
About the cross- dressing thing?
ln the past, funny. Today, disturbing.

09:45.047 --> 09:47.845
Lady, if you don't find a rabbit
with lipstick amusing...

09:47.917 --> 09:49.941
you and I have
nothing to say to each other.

09:50.053 --> 09:52.681
Look, I’m trying to be nice...

09:52.788 --> 09:55.417
but I was brought in
to leverage your synergy...

09:55.525 --> 09:58.357
and I am not going to let you
or some wacky duck- -

09:58.428 --> 09:59.520
Daffy.

09:59.595 --> 10:03.224
Wacky, daffy, nutty, fruitcake,
crispy over rice, it doesn't matter.

10:03.366 --> 10:05.061
Well, these matter.

10:05.568 --> 10:06.967
And this.

10:07.470 --> 10:11.031
And they say we get Daffy back.
Right, boys?

10:11.107 --> 10:13.200
- We want Daffy!
- Bring him back!

10:13.276 --> 10:14.573
We love Daffy!

10:20.550 --> 10:22.040
Little Damian.

10:22.719 --> 10:24.152
Hey, Granny.

10:24.888 --> 10:26.047
Hi, Tweety.

10:26.122 --> 10:27.613
How was work today?

10:28.959 --> 10:30.255
Eventful.

10:30.561 --> 10:32.620
What a nice young man.

10:49.980 --> 10:52.312
Guess who? So did you miss me?

10:56.788 --> 10:58.346
I’m glad I was fired.

10:58.455 --> 11:01.322
ln a few days,
they'll be kissing my befeathered rump...

11:01.425 --> 11:03.290
begging me to come back. But I won't.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.522
Did I miss the part where I invited you in?

11:05.629 --> 11:08.427
I'll be too busy accepting numerous,
multiple offers.

11:08.499 --> 11:10.263
Every studio in town....

11:13.537 --> 11:16.371
Who am I kidding? My career is over.

11:17.175 --> 11:19.369
Perhaps I was being too polite. Get out!

11:19.477 --> 11:22.207
I'll starve. I'll have
to eat envelope glue.

11:22.312 --> 11:23.712
Wait, a sushi bar.

11:25.517 --> 11:26.813
No!

11:32.290 --> 11:33.814
- Daffy.
- Yes.

11:34.692 --> 11:36.957
Leave my father's house. Now.

11:41.967 --> 11:43.866
You live with Daddy?

11:44.002 --> 11:47.563
Yeah, so?
Just, you know, kind of temporarily.

11:47.672 --> 11:49.663
I've hit rock bottom.

11:49.741 --> 11:53.336
I’m hanging out with a security guard
who lives with his father.

11:55.747 --> 11:59.650
My grease and gravy!
Your dad is Damian Drake.

12:00.585 --> 12:04.147
- The super spy.
- He's an actor who plays a spy.

12:05.156 --> 12:08.558
- And that? That was his I Spy Award.
- Ingenious.

12:08.794 --> 12:13.788
An actor playing a super spy as a cover
for being a super spy playing an actor.

12:13.865 --> 12:16.699
ln fact, I'll bet this whole dump
is a super spy lair.

12:16.769 --> 12:18.498
Nothing is as it seems.

12:19.271 --> 12:23.332
You're probably protected by
an invisible force field right this minute.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.374
The force field- penetrating apple.

12:27.446 --> 12:30.745
Just feel free to continue
your delusional ranting...

12:31.084 --> 12:32.914
while I answer my....

12:33.954 --> 12:35.216
Remote?

12:38.390 --> 12:39.584
Hello?

12:51.905 --> 12:53.303
<i>- Son?
- Dad?</i>

12:54.373 --> 12:56.308
What are you doing in the painting?

12:56.409 --> 13:00.572
<i>I wanted to keep you out of this,
but there's no one else I can trust.</i>

13:00.881 --> 13:02.610
<i>Can you hold on a second?</i>

13:03.583 --> 13:05.278
Are you shooting a movie or something?

13:05.385 --> 13:07.580
A new Damian Drake movie? Cool.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.448
<i>Come to Las Vegas.</i>

13:12.158 --> 13:14.923
<i>Ask Dusty Tails for the Blue Monkey.</i>

13:15.228 --> 13:17.219
The Blue Monkey? What's a Blue Monkey?

13:17.297 --> 13:19.822
<i>A diamond. A very special diamond.</i>

13:20.400 --> 13:21.992
<i>Find Dusty Tails.</i>

13:24.104 --> 13:27.164
Dad, you need me
to call the police or something?

13:29.911 --> 13:31.845
<i>- No police.
- Dad, are you all right?</i>

13:31.946 --> 13:35.177
<i>I’m sorry I never told you this before,
but I....</i>

13:39.020 --> 13:41.750
- Dad?
- Diamond? I’m rich!

13:45.293 --> 13:48.456
- I've joined the leisure class.
- I gotta go save my dad.

13:48.529 --> 13:52.488
Your dad, yeah.
So count me in. A spy caper.

13:52.600 --> 13:56.627
Double agents, exploding bikinis,
tigers hanging from helicopters!

13:56.837 --> 13:58.771
I'm through with show biz!

13:58.839 --> 14:01.001
From now on,
I’m gonna live the adventure.

14:01.108 --> 14:04.135
- Next stop, Las Vegas.
- I'll take my dad's old car.

14:04.545 --> 14:08.004
- A super spy car. Let's ride.
- This isn't a spy car.

14:08.649 --> 14:11.949
<i>Your dad is a spy. Ipso ergo, a spy car.</i>

14:12.053 --> 14:14.385
I used to deliver pizzas in this car.

14:15.723 --> 14:17.316
Secret pizzas?

14:17.559 --> 14:19.288
A spy pie, maybe?

14:20.696 --> 14:23.630
Fine, be that way.
But it's definitely a spy car!

14:23.699 --> 14:25.188
A little help here?

14:26.902 --> 14:28.028
Ducks.

14:36.812 --> 14:38.837
You know how I know it's a spy car?

14:38.914 --> 14:42.247
Because it looks
absolutely nothing like a spy car.

14:58.701 --> 15:02.569
<i>I don't think this routine
is gonna work without Daffy, but....</i>

15:02.672 --> 15:03.695
<i>Action.</i>

15:03.772 --> 15:06.741
<i>Say your prayers, rabbit.
It's rabbit season.</i>

15:06.842 --> 15:09.072
<i>- Duck season.
- Rabbit season.</i>

15:11.381 --> 15:14.077
<i>- Rabbit season.
- Wait a minute.</i>

15:14.182 --> 15:16.515
<i>See, I told you
this wasn't gonna work without- - </i>

15:19.355 --> 15:22.119
Pain. Agony!

15:23.893 --> 15:25.224
You're fired.

15:26.095 --> 15:27.255
What?

15:27.797 --> 15:30.630
- But you- -
- You got rid of our best duck.

15:33.536 --> 15:35.299
You can't fire me.

15:35.405 --> 15:38.533
My films have made $950 million!

15:38.942 --> 15:41.637
- That's not a billion.
- Nope. Not a billion.

15:41.744 --> 15:43.269
Okay.

15:45.548 --> 15:46.913
All right.

15:47.250 --> 15:51.118
I think we can all agree that the decision
to get rid of Daffy was a poor one.

15:51.221 --> 15:52.654
But it's time to move on.

15:52.756 --> 15:56.624
And by move on, I mean reversing course
and getting Daffy back.

15:56.994 --> 15:58.325
By Monday.

15:59.830 --> 16:02.321
I will have Daffy back on Monday.

16:04.334 --> 16:05.824
That went well.

16:06.169 --> 16:10.504
Listen, doll face, if I know Daffy,
he's already hit the road by now.

16:17.614 --> 16:18.979
It's good to stretch.

16:19.049 --> 16:21.381
I’m getting tired
of throwing you out of the car.

16:21.485 --> 16:23.511
That's my plan in a nutshell.

16:24.054 --> 16:27.547
Now, listen, if we run into anything
that requires super spy skills...

16:27.658 --> 16:31.116
like cracking wise, smooching dames,
you better leave that to me.

16:31.196 --> 16:34.461
However, if we have
any security guarding needs....

16:34.732 --> 16:37.566
Very funny, duck. I’m not a security guard.

16:37.669 --> 16:41.070
For your information, it's just a job.
It's what I do for money.

16:41.172 --> 16:43.163
What I really do is....

16:44.174 --> 16:45.506
I’m a stuntman.

16:45.577 --> 16:48.045
- You? A stuntman? Please.
- I am !

16:48.413 --> 16:52.474
Did you see those Mummy movies?
I’m in them more than Brendan Fraser is.

16:53.485 --> 16:55.146
No, he couldn't stand that.

16:55.220 --> 16:59.180
One day he decides that, ''No! The Bren-
master does all his own stunts! ''

16:59.257 --> 17:03.523
Listen, muscles, if this heap ever makes it
to Vegas, I'll do all the stunts.

17:03.595 --> 17:04.721
Duck here.

17:04.829 --> 17:08.321
- Daffy, old chum, how the heck- -
- Cram it down your rabbit hole.

17:08.400 --> 17:12.425
I think I can get you your old job back
with less of a pay cut than usual.

17:12.537 --> 17:14.027
So not interested.

17:14.105 --> 17:17.233
I’m off to Las Vegas
with my new sidekick D.J...

17:17.343 --> 17:19.742
to match wits with spies and showgirls.

17:19.844 --> 17:21.744
It's a little adventure I call:

17:21.847 --> 17:24.609
''Daffy Duck's Quest for the Blue Monkey.''

17:24.717 --> 17:26.685
And you're not in it.

17:28.687 --> 17:30.176
Blue Monkey?

17:43.369 --> 17:44.631
<i>Blue Monkey?</i>

17:46.972 --> 17:48.769
<i>It's a little adventure I call.</i>

17:48.874 --> 17:51.866
<i>'Daffy Duck's Quest for the Blue Monkey. '</i>

18:05.592 --> 18:07.287
This is unacceptable!

18:10.930 --> 18:14.924
We cannot have 9- year- olds working
in sweatshops making Acme sneakers...

18:15.068 --> 18:18.094
not when 3- year- olds
work for so much less.

18:19.673 --> 18:22.301
But, sir, they require naps.

18:23.176 --> 18:26.145
Put double espresso in their sippy cups.

18:29.082 --> 18:30.674
What's next on the agenda?

18:30.784 --> 18:34.151
Where's my people? What's coming up?
What's the next thing?

18:37.858 --> 18:39.450
Thank you, Bob.

18:40.093 --> 18:41.789
Grave news, my friends.

18:41.995 --> 18:44.862
Direct your attention to the video screen.

18:48.603 --> 18:51.628
Cable, input, VCR, satellite.

18:54.709 --> 18:58.372
Input, satellite, tape, menu, rewind...

18:58.546 --> 19:00.036
power, on.

19:03.150 --> 19:07.109
lt seems that Damian Drake's son
knows about the Blue Monkey...

19:07.288 --> 19:09.722
and he is on his way to Las Vegas.

19:10.558 --> 19:13.959
He must not find the location
of the diamond before we do.

19:14.996 --> 19:17.022
How is the interrogation going?

19:22.570 --> 19:24.663
<i>He's about ready to crack, boss!</i>

19:31.312 --> 19:34.475
Cable, input, VCR and satellite, off.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.582
We cannot let the good guys
win this time, people.

19:37.685 --> 19:39.711
We must capture this son of a spy...

19:39.820 --> 19:41.345
and we must locate the diamond...

19:41.422 --> 19:44.256
and use its powers
for our own diabolical ends!

19:48.230 --> 19:50.891
- Copy that to all departments.
- I didn't quite get that.

19:50.999 --> 19:52.364
Didn't quite....

19:52.833 --> 19:54.995
Something about
capturing the son of a spy...

19:55.070 --> 19:57.664
and using the diamond's power
for our diabolical ends.

19:57.739 --> 20:00.572
Be sure and use the laugh.
I like the laugh. Don't you?

20:00.676 --> 20:02.610
- And what is your name?
- Mary.

20:02.711 --> 20:04.201
Well, Mary...

20:05.914 --> 20:08.576
how'd you like to do a
little kissing later?

20:10.185 --> 20:12.710
That's what they all say at first.

20:13.855 --> 20:17.757
Soon the ACME Corporation
will tower over all of creation!

20:17.860 --> 20:19.293
All of creation!

20:30.038 --> 20:31.471
Wait a minute.

20:33.608 --> 20:35.872
- Yes?
- What about the duck?

20:42.385 --> 20:44.546
Extra crispy.

20:55.665 --> 20:56.996
Hello?

21:13.483 --> 21:16.612
D.J., I’m not here to fire you again.

21:16.687 --> 21:20.646
I just want to know
if that duck told you where he was going.

22:11.142 --> 22:14.907
- Doesn't anyone knock anymore?
- Why are you torturing me?

22:15.413 --> 22:17.745
What have I ever done that....

22:21.386 --> 22:22.547
Great.

22:23.188 --> 22:26.055
I just fired the son of our biggest star.

22:29.194 --> 22:32.095
This has been a career- making day, Kate.

22:32.197 --> 22:34.688
First you get rid of the duck
that everybody hates...

22:34.766 --> 22:37.564
but then, of course,
they all want him back.

22:38.436 --> 22:42.373
And worst of all,
you get into a big fight with Bugs Bunny...

22:42.441 --> 22:46.900
who you revere and who you've tried
to model your life after.

22:48.514 --> 22:51.074
I hate to see a grown man cry.

22:51.517 --> 22:53.678
Especially when it's a girl.

22:54.220 --> 22:56.414
Listen, toots,
would it stop the waterworks...

22:56.522 --> 23:00.424
if I told you Daffy was going to Las Vegas
with that guy D.J.?

23:02.728 --> 23:04.127
lt might.

23:04.363 --> 23:08.459
Well, then,
how's about we travel in style in this?

23:12.404 --> 23:14.565
Las Vegas, Jeeves.

23:15.541 --> 23:17.372
<i>Taking you to Las Vegas.</i>

24:01.821 --> 24:04.289
You've got no music in your soul, sister.

24:04.358 --> 24:06.291
I am aware of that, yes.

24:07.694 --> 24:10.595
He sure went for all the extras.
What a maroon.

24:10.664 --> 24:13.327
Don't touch anything.
This is Damian Drake's car- -

24:13.433 --> 24:15.162
- Let's see.
- No!

24:20.540 --> 24:22.475
What does this one do?

24:26.646 --> 24:28.706
<i>Shaken, not stirred, sir.</i>

24:29.884 --> 24:31.784
It's 5:00 somewhere.

24:31.886 --> 24:36.186
- If you touch one more thing- -
- I’m about to defy you.

24:38.192 --> 24:40.854
<i>- Now you done it.
- Arms at your side, please.</i>

24:49.670 --> 24:51.570
<i>Formalwear activated.</i>

24:52.040 --> 24:54.031
You clean up nice, kid.

24:55.843 --> 24:56.902
No!

25:06.588 --> 25:08.021
Las Vegas!

25:28.443 --> 25:29.671
Smell that, D.J.?

25:29.745 --> 25:32.213
That's the sweet aroma
of money, glamour...

25:32.281 --> 25:35.114
and busload upon busload
of senior citizens.

25:35.218 --> 25:37.014
Cool it, duck. This could be dangerous.

25:37.085 --> 25:40.680
Right, we find Dusty Tails,
save your dad, get the diamond...

25:40.756 --> 25:43.248
apply kung fu liberally as needed.

25:47.230 --> 25:49.220
<i>Under no circumstances are you to allow...</i>

25:49.299 --> 25:52.757
<i>the young Mr. Drake and his duck cohort
out of the casino in one piece.</i>

25:52.868 --> 25:54.700
<i>- ls that clear?
- Okay.</i>

25:54.771 --> 25:57.534
You want the varmints
and what they come for.

25:57.606 --> 26:01.474
I got you. But what's in it for old Sam?

26:11.387 --> 26:13.116
I got you.

26:16.994 --> 26:20.793
Did you know that Dusty Tails sang the
theme song to six Damian Drake movies?

26:20.897 --> 26:22.126
I know. He's my father.

26:22.231 --> 26:24.097
- Your dad is Damian Drake?
- Yes!

26:24.168 --> 26:26.261
I’m kidding, relax. We did that.

26:27.003 --> 26:29.267
<i>I say, listen up, y'all.</i>

26:29.339 --> 26:32.672
<i>Please put your greasy,
buffet- shoveling hands together...</i>

26:32.776 --> 26:34.243
<i>for our next act.</i>

26:34.311 --> 26:37.474
<i>If you've heard her before,
you're not here now.</i>

26:37.580 --> 26:39.480
<i>So, I say, let me introduce you...</i>

26:39.583 --> 26:42.677
<i>to Miss Dusty Tails.</i>

27:18.123 --> 27:19.350
Dusty!

27:20.691 --> 27:22.159
Can I talk to you?

27:31.535 --> 27:32.729
What the....

27:41.813 --> 27:43.041
What?

27:43.815 --> 27:45.976
Dusty, I gotta talk to you.

27:46.651 --> 27:49.381
- I’m Damian Drake's son, D.J.
- What?

27:51.022 --> 27:53.014
How do I know it's you?

27:55.193 --> 27:56.751
You are Damian's son.

27:56.861 --> 27:58.853
ls there someplace we can talk?

28:00.332 --> 28:04.393
- Excuse me, I have to change.
- Okay, toots, hand over the diamond.

28:04.502 --> 28:07.028
- He brought a goose?
- It's duck, thank you.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.831
- Hi.
- You again.

28:10.042 --> 28:12.066
Listen up, you darn imbeciles!

28:12.178 --> 28:14.544
We gotta get them varmints
and what they come for!

28:14.613 --> 28:17.912
- And then we blast them?
- Then we blast them.

28:18.184 --> 28:21.085
Now if I were a giant diamond,
where would I be?

28:21.187 --> 28:22.779
Well, not there.

28:23.756 --> 28:25.724
- My dad's in trouble...
- Not here.

28:25.791 --> 28:29.488
...and he said that
I should ask you about the Blue Monkey.

28:30.062 --> 28:32.623
- So then you know?
- Definitely. Yes.

28:32.731 --> 28:35.723
I figured something must have happened
when he didn't show up.

28:35.801 --> 28:38.235
I’m sorry,
but that's what comes with being a spy.

28:38.304 --> 28:42.604
So, you're a spy, too?

28:43.476 --> 28:46.412
The pop diva thing?
That's just one side of me.

28:46.479 --> 28:49.539
I also work for the Agency.
Professional assassin.

28:49.615 --> 28:52.084
It's really hard
trying to juggle the two sometimes.

28:52.152 --> 28:54.278
I don't know what I'll do when I have kids.

28:54.387 --> 28:58.983
Do you know how hard it is to find a nanny
with advance weapons training?

28:59.125 --> 29:02.117
How many galoshes died
to make that little number?

29:02.229 --> 29:04.423
What about this Blue Monkey?

29:04.498 --> 29:07.990
Your father was assigned to track it down
before the chairman could.

29:08.101 --> 29:10.501
The diamond has supernatural powers.

29:10.604 --> 29:13.767
lt would be a disaster
if it fell into the wrong hands.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.274
I was supposed to give him this.

29:16.443 --> 29:20.504
This is not a king- sized diamond.
This is a queen of diamonds.

29:20.614 --> 29:22.981
What kind of sick joke is this?

29:23.150 --> 29:24.980
- Can I have that?
- Very funny.

29:25.085 --> 29:26.780
That is so sweet.

29:26.953 --> 29:29.285
You trying to take over for your father.

29:29.356 --> 29:31.620
These evil forces? They're bad people.

29:31.691 --> 29:34.854
Relax, sister. I don't know
the meaning of the word ''fear.''

29:34.961 --> 29:36.452
Say your prayers, duck!

29:36.531 --> 29:38.794
Fear: noun. A state of terror.

29:39.165 --> 29:40.497
Incoming!

29:51.011 --> 29:53.480
This mission
needs years of experience and training.

29:53.548 --> 29:56.881
Maybe. I ain't got time for that right now.
I gotta go save my dad.

29:56.984 --> 29:58.952
Don't lose that card. It's important.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.781
After him, boys!

30:17.705 --> 30:19.469
Easy on the feathers.

30:19.541 --> 30:23.032
Come back here, you card- carrying coyote!

30:24.846 --> 30:27.405
Dadburn slapstick cliché!

30:27.915 --> 30:31.579
Faster! Climb like my life depended on it.

30:34.523 --> 30:36.081
You run, I'll steer.

30:36.191 --> 30:38.989
Right! I mean, left. Your other left.

30:44.066 --> 30:46.364
That's what I’m talking about!

30:48.136 --> 30:49.967
ls that all you got?

30:51.006 --> 30:53.133
That's gonna leave a mark.

30:55.577 --> 30:58.011
That's not boxing. Bite his ear!

31:01.149 --> 31:04.312
Left and a right and a
left and a right- left!

31:07.255 --> 31:09.348
I’m gonna come up on you.

31:18.001 --> 31:20.231
I'll take that playing card.

31:27.877 --> 31:30.038
- After it, stunt boy.
- Man.

31:30.113 --> 31:31.273
Jump!

31:50.366 --> 31:52.891
All right, when I say,
place your bets, gentlemen.

31:52.969 --> 31:56.531
Money plays, loser stays.
Everyone's a.... Not everyone.

31:56.607 --> 31:58.972
Here's my money. Now play.

31:59.309 --> 32:01.139
- Card, sir?
- Hit me.

32:01.245 --> 32:04.304
Don't you want to
look at your cards first, son?

32:04.415 --> 32:07.213
Boy's about as sharp as a bowling ball.

32:07.451 --> 32:09.612
- Hit me.
- No, hit me first!

32:09.720 --> 32:11.914
I said await your turn, sir.

32:11.988 --> 32:13.251
Hit me.

32:19.630 --> 32:23.293
No, hit me, fragnabbit!

32:24.835 --> 32:27.565
- He's the boss.
- You son of a- -

32:27.638 --> 32:29.003
Card, sir?

32:29.640 --> 32:30.902
Hit me.

32:31.075 --> 32:32.940
Twenty- one, a winner!

32:33.010 --> 32:34.342
Let's go!

32:36.848 --> 32:39.646
''And then they made
their heroic escape! ''

32:45.589 --> 32:48.855
I say we do Cirque du Soleil
and call it a night.

32:50.295 --> 32:52.559
How about the Liberace Museum?

32:55.567 --> 32:58.900
All right, let's see what this baby
can really do.

33:05.577 --> 33:07.568
Now, that's an interesting feature.

33:07.645 --> 33:10.409
Come back, you absconders!

33:10.682 --> 33:12.616
Watch yourself, ma'am.

33:13.486 --> 33:15.476
I love this rug.

33:15.854 --> 33:19.255
- Come back here, you varmints!
- Run. Move. Go.

33:24.095 --> 33:25.427
Nice car.

33:25.663 --> 33:27.154
Don't hit me.

33:27.799 --> 33:31.257
It's a modified Chevrolet
with a big 24 on the side.

33:36.342 --> 33:40.210
Out of the way, fancy boy.
I’m a- commandeering this here clown car.

33:40.312 --> 33:42.041
After them, boys!

33:42.147 --> 33:43.445
Shotgun!

33:45.017 --> 33:47.985
Rag- flagging ragtag sidekicks!

33:50.055 --> 33:52.853
Slow down, will you? I’m waddling here.

33:52.958 --> 33:55.722
Come back, you darn idiot galoots!

34:00.566 --> 34:04.969
There's gotta be 314 hotels
and 142 casinos in Las Vegas.

34:05.038 --> 34:07.199
We are never going to find that duck.

34:11.844 --> 34:13.870
Daff never misses a cue.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.411
- What's up, duck?
- Don't you start with me.

34:24.056 --> 34:25.422
Excuse me.

34:26.525 --> 34:27.719
You!

34:27.828 --> 34:28.886
- You.
- Him.

34:28.995 --> 34:30.223
- Her.
- Them !

34:30.330 --> 34:31.728
Out of my way!

34:35.902 --> 34:37.494
Dagnabbit!

34:37.603 --> 34:41.233
- You are in big trouble, mister.
- Agreed!

34:46.545 --> 34:47.570
Out!

34:47.681 --> 34:50.377
What are you doing, kidnapping me?
Stop the car.

34:50.449 --> 34:52.384
This is my adventure, bub.

34:59.292 --> 35:00.589
Coming through.

35:05.066 --> 35:08.433
What brings you to Las Vegas?
You ran out of people to fire in L.A.?

35:08.535 --> 35:10.163
You stole my duck.

35:10.238 --> 35:13.866
- Your duck? I belong to the world.
- You know what? You can have him.

35:23.551 --> 35:26.418
Dynamite? Who has dynamite?

35:26.787 --> 35:28.186
Welcome to my world.

35:30.191 --> 35:31.215
Hang on.

35:43.738 --> 35:45.969
Throw it out the window. Throw it out!

35:46.073 --> 35:49.305
- But innocent people could be hurt.
- Throw it out the window!

35:49.410 --> 35:52.073
lt will send the wrong message
to children.

36:07.963 --> 36:10.227
Didn't he used to be behind us?

36:24.246 --> 36:26.976
We're having duck tonight, boys.

36:27.617 --> 36:31.450
Just a suggestion, but all those in favor
of not hitting that wall say ''aye.''

36:31.520 --> 36:33.284
- Aye!
- Mother.

36:33.623 --> 36:34.988
<i>Taking you to Mother.</i>

36:59.782 --> 37:03.651
Look, a shooting star.
Quick, everybody make a wish.

37:05.054 --> 37:08.990
You know, I’m beginning to think
that this one is the spy car.

37:09.058 --> 37:09.786
What?

37:11.996 --> 37:14.657
<i>ETA to Mother, 10 minutes.</i>

37:27.177 --> 37:30.840
<i>Please return your seatbacks
to their full and upright position.</i>

37:30.948 --> 37:34.111
So, what are your plans now, if I may ask?

37:34.184 --> 37:36.618
Daffy will save us. He's the hero.

37:36.687 --> 37:38.780
All right, bucktooth. Stick a carrot in it.

37:38.856 --> 37:42.190
Everybody calm down, all right?
I can handle this.

37:54.372 --> 37:55.963
Sell my Warner Brothers stock.

37:56.040 --> 37:59.032
I got an inside tip
that Bugs Bunny is about to die.

38:05.683 --> 38:07.048
Out of gas.

38:07.552 --> 38:10.350
What? lt doesn't work like that.

38:13.391 --> 38:14.756
Thanks, toots.

38:26.771 --> 38:28.602
- Carrot?
- No, thanks.

38:34.679 --> 38:38.776
You really think that playing card
is going to help you rescue your father?

38:38.883 --> 38:40.283
Yeah, I do.

38:41.087 --> 38:43.885
You know this all sounds insane, right?

38:48.260 --> 38:51.855
I remember the first time
I saw your dad in the movies.

38:53.965 --> 38:55.695
So breathtaking.

39:02.207 --> 39:04.108
Your hair smells nice.

39:05.311 --> 39:09.714
- You say something?
- No, just saying good night.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.083
I’m telling you, Daffy...

39:13.153 --> 39:16.212
I heard the Warner Brothers say
you were their best duck.

39:16.288 --> 39:19.281
Flattered though I may be,
flattened I will not...

39:19.391 --> 39:21.222
in order for you to get the laughs.

39:21.293 --> 39:23.727
It's all.... And then....

39:25.231 --> 39:28.223
- And your tail is on fire.
- Exactly my point.

39:28.301 --> 39:30.791
No, really, your tail's on fire.

39:34.141 --> 39:36.132
Daff, you're accident- prone.

39:37.310 --> 39:39.107
What am I talking to you for?

39:39.211 --> 39:43.739
All you have to do is munch on a carrot,
and people love you.

39:51.322 --> 39:55.259
I need you to move my 12:00 appointment
up to 2:00 and then back to 1 1 :00.

39:55.327 --> 39:59.093
Then just cancel it.
And I need you to get a helicopter and....

39:59.164 --> 40:01.257
No, don't put me on hold.

40:02.133 --> 40:03.259
Oh, God.

40:05.136 --> 40:08.106
I can't die out here.

40:08.273 --> 40:10.104
This wasn't the plan.

40:10.275 --> 40:13.005
After this comedy...

40:14.779 --> 40:17.010
I promised myself
I would only do real movies...

40:17.115 --> 40:20.779
about the human condition
crammed with social relevance.

40:21.854 --> 40:25.790
There's nothing but a big rock
for 10 miles in that, that...

40:25.991 --> 40:28.016
that, and that direction.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.358
I say we go that way.

40:32.464 --> 40:36.265
Say, who are you kidding here?
We're goners!

40:36.335 --> 40:38.495
Water! I can't die now.

40:38.604 --> 40:42.801
Think of the millions of children
who want me to have the diamond.

40:42.874 --> 40:44.638
The poor children!

40:45.278 --> 40:46.336
Look at that.

40:49.615 --> 40:52.483
ls it a mirage? Or just product placement?

40:52.618 --> 40:56.019
Who cares? With shopping convenience
at such low prices.

40:56.122 --> 40:59.523
Water, Fresca, Mountain Dew.
Your product name here.

41:00.793 --> 41:02.523
ls this your idea?

41:04.865 --> 41:06.058
The audience expects it.

41:06.165 --> 41:09.464
They don't even notice
this kind of thing anymore.

41:12.171 --> 41:14.799
Nice of Wal- Mart
to provide these Wal- Mart beverages...

41:14.875 --> 41:17.969
in return for us saying ''Wal- Mart''
so many times.

41:22.816 --> 41:24.681
Where's Yosemite Sam?

41:25.252 --> 41:27.777
- What is your report?
- Boss, it wasn't me.

41:27.854 --> 41:31.449
That razzan- frazzan duck
and that crazy son D.J...

41:31.525 --> 41:33.891
and a humina- humina Dusty Tails.

41:35.195 --> 41:37.823
You know, that makes a lot of sense.

41:37.898 --> 41:39.297
Thank you.

41:42.837 --> 41:47.296
Mr. Drake, are you going to save us
the bother of eliminating your son?

41:47.374 --> 41:50.172
My son is going to kick your evil butt.

41:51.345 --> 41:53.371
- Mr. Chairman.
- Yes, Dad.

41:53.514 --> 41:56.312
- Desert operative.
- No.

41:57.050 --> 41:58.881
Not a bad idea, Dad.

41:59.653 --> 42:02.350
Our desert operative is due for a win.

42:16.771 --> 42:19.831
I told you we should have
made that left turn at Albuquerque.

42:19.907 --> 42:21.898
Don't start that again.

42:53.808 --> 42:55.436
All right. Here's the plan.

42:55.544 --> 42:59.480
We wait here for the next truck or car
or camel or whatever...

42:59.581 --> 43:01.810
and take Bugs and Daffy...

43:01.917 --> 43:04.215
get back to Hollywood
and finish making the movie.

43:04.286 --> 43:05.913
What are you going to do?

43:05.988 --> 43:09.754
- I’m just gonna keep walking that way.
- That's your plan?

43:11.727 --> 43:14.719
Yep. That's the direction
the car was going.

43:22.738 --> 43:26.265
You're not leaving me here
while you make off with my diamond.

43:40.223 --> 43:42.623
I don't wanna get too wrapped up
in your caper...

43:42.725 --> 43:46.491
but let's assume that you're right
and Damian Drake is a spy?

43:46.596 --> 43:47.927
Super spy.

43:48.765 --> 43:52.724
What's the point of just meandering
through the desert if....

43:57.574 --> 43:58.666
Here.

44:00.076 --> 44:01.304
Be safe.

44:01.412 --> 44:04.108
- Attaboy. Trust your instincts.
- Yeah.

44:04.181 --> 44:08.345
Except for the water tower, the Batmobile,
the rubble known as Las Vegas.

44:09.085 --> 44:13.317
There's nobody as rich, famous,
and powerful as my father...

44:13.424 --> 44:16.085
who just disappears into thin air.

44:21.332 --> 44:24.824
Suddenly I feel like
I'm in Aunt Marge's Jell- O mold.

44:25.302 --> 44:28.294
Guys, it's air- conditioned in here.
Come on in.

44:30.941 --> 44:32.602
<i>Intruder alert.</i>

44:52.997 --> 44:54.191
Easy.

45:01.505 --> 45:02.631
Earth freak.

45:08.078 --> 45:11.913
Okay, buster.  Where's Damian
Drake and that big diamond?

45:14.853 --> 45:17.151
Cleanup on aisle three.

45:17.656 --> 45:19.487
Can I be of service?

45:19.558 --> 45:23.050
I am monitored to respond
to the name Robbie.

45:23.161 --> 45:24.355
Hi, D.J.

45:25.664 --> 45:28.098
At ease. I’m Mother.

45:29.068 --> 45:32.161
Yeah, like the car said
that we would be meeting you.

45:32.237 --> 45:33.727
How do you know my name?

45:33.906 --> 45:36.840
D.J., I've known you
since you were this big.

45:38.510 --> 45:41.036
That's not really possible, is it?

45:41.180 --> 45:43.045
Must have been a photo.

45:43.149 --> 45:46.209
Let me just take care
of this, and we'll....

45:47.887 --> 45:50.650
Give it to me straight. How bad is it?

45:50.722 --> 45:52.418
So, shall we?

45:53.325 --> 45:55.317
So little to do, so much time.

45:55.393 --> 45:59.387
You're going to put him back, right?
I can't go back to L.A. with duck soup.

45:59.498 --> 46:03.867
We do have the facilities
to reconstitute the body.

46:03.936 --> 46:06.871
The mind though,
will remain a gooey mess.

46:07.573 --> 46:09.404
So, about my father?

46:09.909 --> 46:13.208
All in due time. Lovely. Yes. Blow.

46:13.279 --> 46:17.773
All right, break it up, fellas. Nice coats.
White is the new black, you know.

46:17.883 --> 46:18.941
Yes.

46:19.886 --> 46:20.943
Look.

46:21.054 --> 46:23.579
- So this is Area 51, right?
- No.

46:23.689 --> 46:26.716
The secret military base
where they keep the aliens?

46:26.793 --> 46:31.058
No, Area 51 is actually
a paranoid fantasy we concocted...

46:31.130 --> 46:34.066
to hide the true identity of this facility.

46:34.134 --> 46:36.727
- Which is?
- Area 52.

46:37.204 --> 46:39.104
But don't quote me on that.

46:39.205 --> 46:41.400
Oh, right. Area 52.

46:44.478 --> 46:47.311
- So, Mother- -
- Call me ''Mom.''

46:47.948 --> 46:51.247
Mom, what is it
that you do here exactly, anyway?

46:51.318 --> 46:55.880
Creation, transubstantiation, destruction.
It's stressful. All kinds of things.

46:55.956 --> 46:58.891
They're already here. You're next.

47:00.961 --> 47:01.723
My God...

47:02.195 --> 47:03.094
what am I going to do with you?

47:03.164 --> 47:04.653
You've done nothing but screw up!

47:04.731 --> 47:07.723
You've walked off mesas.
You've been smashed by boulders.

47:07.801 --> 47:09.565
You've been run over by diesel trucks.

47:09.637 --> 47:12.970
Don't blame the equipment. It's good.
It's ACME equipment.

47:13.073 --> 47:15.565
You're a coyote. Be wily.

47:16.576 --> 47:20.069
All right, now.
Buck up and let's see a little smile.

47:21.682 --> 47:23.240
Little bigger.

47:26.921 --> 47:28.354
That's nice.

47:28.789 --> 47:33.250
Now, just go take a shower,
and don't come back till you smell better!

47:33.494 --> 47:38.363
Be careful. There're men moving a safe
out there, and I don't want you to....

47:39.033 --> 47:42.332
And be careful
of the box of fireworks because....

47:44.605 --> 47:48.098
I suppose I should mention
the plate- glass window....

47:51.779 --> 47:53.906
It's tough being the boss.

47:58.453 --> 48:00.115
A communication.

48:00.189 --> 48:01.747
<i>Memo to Marvin the Martian.</i>

48:04.992 --> 48:07.655
<i>Obtain the playing card,
and destroy the duck.</i>

48:07.762 --> 48:12.598
<i>And when I say destroy the duck,
I mean kill him viciously and painfully.</i>

48:13.035 --> 48:16.869
A mission? I’m all a- tingle.

48:17.339 --> 48:21.207
So, here we are
in the I- can't- tell- you- what room.

48:21.309 --> 48:23.061
Robert, can you take
care of that, please?

48:23.074 --> 48:24.836
Yes, madam.

48:25.180 --> 48:28.115
When you bring Daffy back,
could you make him 20% funnier?

48:28.183 --> 48:31.050
- I heard that.
- What were we discussing?

48:31.153 --> 48:33.451
This isn't about the giant ants, is it?

48:33.522 --> 48:38.221
- Giant ants?
- Because they're not really ants anymore.

48:39.027 --> 48:41.359
Tell me about the Blue Monkey.

48:42.298 --> 48:46.701
How do you know about that thing
that I've never heard of in my entire life?

48:48.070 --> 48:49.662
My dad told me.

48:50.006 --> 48:54.032
What is the point
of making them pinky swear?

48:55.211 --> 48:57.075
All right.

48:58.147 --> 49:00.138
Now this tape will explain everything.

49:00.216 --> 49:03.208
lt was prepared especially for your father.

49:06.856 --> 49:08.517
<i>Greetings, Damian Drake.</i>

49:08.591 --> 49:13.153
<i>If you are watching this, you are aware
that the world is in grave danger.</i>

49:13.229 --> 49:17.530
<i>The ACME Corporation is in hot pursuit
of the Blue Monkey diamond...</i>

49:17.600 --> 49:22.060
<i>a supernatural gem with the ability
to turn people into monkeys...</i>

49:22.173 --> 49:23.434
<i>and then back again.</i>

49:23.540 --> 49:26.703
<i>lt is the ACME chairman's goal
to turn the population...</i>

49:26.776 --> 49:31.009
<i>into monkey slaves
to manufacture shoddy ACME goods...</i>

49:31.081 --> 49:33.777
<i>and then change them back to people
to buy the stuff.</i>

49:34.884 --> 49:36.352
Unbelievable.

49:36.419 --> 49:38.114
<i>Unbelievable, you may say.</i>

49:38.222 --> 49:42.715
<i>Your mission is this.
Find it, destroy it, save humanity.</i>

49:44.127 --> 49:46.961
<i>And remember,
no one wants to be turned into a monkey.</i>

49:51.735 --> 49:53.292
So that's why.

49:53.971 --> 49:58.567
Those guys came after my dad
because he was going to save the world.

49:59.210 --> 50:02.907
So that means if I go after the diamond,
then the bad guys come after me.

50:03.013 --> 50:06.040
Hang on.
You're not seriously thinking about- -

50:06.116 --> 50:08.880
Taking over your father's mission?

50:10.387 --> 50:12.617
- I guess that would be all right.
- What?

50:12.724 --> 50:17.217
Listen, if you're going to be a spy,
you'll need spy stuff.

50:17.895 --> 50:21.627
So, is this where you keep
all the high- tech spy gadgets?

50:24.202 --> 50:25.293
Yes.

50:28.907 --> 50:31.205
That's cool. So I get
to use all this stuff?

50:31.276 --> 50:34.404
No, your stuff is over here.

50:36.448 --> 50:38.040
But I really like the....

50:38.116 --> 50:41.813
All right. Looks like
an ordinary cell phone.

50:42.119 --> 50:46.250
Three- way calling, voice dialing,
downloadable ringtones.

50:46.658 --> 50:50.492
- My phone does all that.
- Superconducting electromagnet.

50:51.763 --> 50:53.424
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

50:53.498 --> 50:56.160
GPS with mapping software...

50:56.268 --> 50:58.964
tip calculator, Gameboy.

50:59.071 --> 51:00.298
Gameboy?

51:01.674 --> 51:03.436
High- powered laser.

51:03.508 --> 51:07.969
Polycarbonate rappelling line
with jet- propelled micro grappling hook.

51:08.280 --> 51:10.976
Nose hair trimmer.
You always want to look your best.

51:11.083 --> 51:14.814
Get over here, you idiot.
No, cold. Cold. Warm, warmer.

51:19.024 --> 51:20.686
<i>Permit me, madam.</i>

51:20.825 --> 51:23.590
Robert, darling. Excellent choice.

51:23.663 --> 51:25.096
Swank pants.

51:25.331 --> 51:27.162
And comfortable, too.

51:27.266 --> 51:31.669
Plus, liquid hydrogen rocket pockets,
here and here.

51:31.772 --> 51:34.831
And stitching,
nuclear- powered crotch pad....

51:36.475 --> 51:38.136
He'll be down in a moment.

51:41.815 --> 51:43.475
Wakey, wakey, friends.

51:43.549 --> 51:46.518
Time to wreak mayhem
in the cause of evil.

51:48.854 --> 51:52.882
Mother, just one last question.
What's the deal with this card?

51:54.160 --> 51:57.323
That is the window
into what lies behind her smile.

51:57.396 --> 51:58.557
What?

51:58.665 --> 52:02.692
I’m sorry, our intelligence people
feel a need to code everything in a riddle.

52:02.803 --> 52:07.502
They get some kind of perverse pleasure
out of it. I think it's corporate.

52:08.041 --> 52:09.474
All humans.

52:10.177 --> 52:12.270
Looks like we got company.

52:16.683 --> 52:18.275
Illegal aliens.

52:20.287 --> 52:21.652
Exterminate them.

52:21.722 --> 52:25.283
Darn. I knew this day would come.

52:26.461 --> 52:29.157
Let us exterminate them.

52:34.002 --> 52:38.132
<i>Emergency shutdown activated.
Force- barrier seal in 30 seconds.</i>

52:38.206 --> 52:39.672
Exterminate.

52:42.376 --> 52:44.469
The playing card, please.

52:44.544 --> 52:47.878
I'll take that. Out of my way.
Hero coming through.

52:48.983 --> 52:50.712
There is no escape.

52:55.823 --> 52:57.586
You pesky fowl!

53:09.704 --> 53:14.266
Isn't it about time to enjoy a frosty,
cold soda at the concession stand?

53:15.044 --> 53:16.671
Exterminate!

53:17.578 --> 53:19.740
Get the lead out.
Bus is leaving.

53:21.417 --> 53:23.510
Halt or be fricasseed.

53:31.460 --> 53:32.926
That was fun.

53:33.027 --> 53:34.689
Looking for this?

53:37.700 --> 53:39.964
Now, what did she mean by a window?

53:41.070 --> 53:43.970
The window into what lies
behind her smile.

53:45.708 --> 53:47.141
That's the Mona Lisa.

53:47.242 --> 53:50.234
- Which is in the Louvre.
- Which is in Paris.

53:50.880 --> 53:53.473
Just how are we supposed to get to Paris?

53:53.649 --> 53:54.911
Like this.

54:25.115 --> 54:27.583
lt doesn't look like
much of a window to me.

54:27.650 --> 54:29.584
Maybe the diamond is in the painting.

54:29.652 --> 54:32.815
- All we have to do is steal the Mona Lisa.
- Way ahead of you.

54:34.257 --> 54:37.283
- No, you look, you don't touch, right?
- Yeah.

54:37.427 --> 54:39.224
But I’m already in costume.

54:39.295 --> 54:41.661
- That's a good look for you.
- Do you think so?

54:41.765 --> 54:43.289
Wait a minute.

54:52.910 --> 54:54.468
lt is a window.

54:57.915 --> 54:59.405
It's an X- ray.

55:00.451 --> 55:01.645
Sorry.

55:04.421 --> 55:07.356
It's a map of Africa.
Maybe that's where the diamond is.

55:07.458 --> 55:09.255
Hold it up. I'll take a picture.

55:09.426 --> 55:11.257
Can I take a picture? Please?

55:11.328 --> 55:14.320
Come on, give me your phone.
I want to take a picture, too.

55:14.431 --> 55:16.194
Cheese it, the cops.

55:19.335 --> 55:20.428
He's gone.

55:20.504 --> 55:23.803
So let me take a picture, will you?
I want to take a picture, too.

55:23.874 --> 55:27.002
Come on, please? Can I hold the window?
Let me see the window.

55:27.111 --> 55:28.669
I'll take that!

55:30.549 --> 55:33.483
What gives, doc?
We made 35 pictures together.

55:34.152 --> 55:36.642
As it turns out, I’m secretly evil.

55:37.022 --> 55:38.546
That's show biz for you.

55:38.656 --> 55:42.388
Now make with the card,
so I can please my dark masters.

55:42.494 --> 55:44.620
Yes, sir. Queen of diamonds is your card.

55:44.695 --> 55:48.290
Just put it back in the deck,
anywhere is fine. And oopsie- daisy!

55:48.365 --> 55:51.301
- ls this your card?
- No.

55:51.369 --> 55:54.338
- This?
- No.

55:55.373 --> 55:58.308
- Run. This?
- No.

55:58.376 --> 56:00.844
I said it's the queen of diamonds,
I tell you.

56:00.912 --> 56:02.504
You mean, like this one?

56:06.418 --> 56:08.386
Think we should go back and help him?

56:08.486 --> 56:11.387
Elmer never gets Bugs.
It's a formula, but it works.

56:11.489 --> 56:14.584
The great thing about movies,
you always know what will happen.

56:14.693 --> 56:16.388
For instance, if this was a movie...

56:16.494 --> 56:19.088
you and I’d probably wind up together.

56:23.703 --> 56:25.694
If you don't let go of me, I'll scream...

56:25.771 --> 56:27.965
but I’m not gonna stop screaming!

56:46.058 --> 56:48.253
Well, this is surreal.

56:48.494 --> 56:52.897
Stop or I'll fire.

57:28.702 --> 57:29.896
Hello.

57:31.805 --> 57:33.066
Oh, my.

57:34.408 --> 57:35.932
Ladies, please.

57:51.458 --> 57:52.652
Gendarme!

57:54.595 --> 57:57.495
<i>- Oui, monsieur?
- There's a man there. He's got a woman.</i>

57:57.597 --> 58:01.124
She's tied up in a burlap sack.
He's taking her to the Eiffel Tower.

58:01.235 --> 58:03.567
lt is spring, is it not?

58:21.989 --> 58:23.787
I’m gonna blast you.

58:33.668 --> 58:35.000
Shucks.

58:49.251 --> 58:53.517
''Pointillism: A technique
of using individual dots of pigment...

58:53.621 --> 58:56.590
''which, taken together, make an image.''

58:57.159 --> 58:58.490
Oh, crud.

59:00.362 --> 59:04.093
I think when you go to the movies,
you should learn something.

59:19.716 --> 59:22.708
<i>Pardonnez- moi. Excusez- moi.</i>

59:44.374 --> 59:46.569
Look at that clown here.

59:46.675 --> 59:49.406
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

59:50.480 --> 59:51.572
You.

59:52.849 --> 59:54.009
Come here.

59:54.084 --> 59:55.210
Wait a minute.

59:55.318 --> 59:57.411
- I don't want any trouble.
- What are you doing?

59:57.520 --> 59:59.750
I just want your pants!

01:00:04.427 --> 01:00:07.886
That's right. I’m a vicious bird of prey.

01:00:13.671 --> 01:00:14.762
<i>Merci.</i>

01:00:45.336 --> 01:00:47.396
He's got the camera !

01:01:00.251 --> 01:01:01.878
Give the girl back!

01:01:50.469 --> 01:01:53.097
- What kept you?
- You okay?

01:01:53.505 --> 01:01:54.905
That was great.

01:02:01.948 --> 01:02:05.577
I’d say it's a perfect day.
Except for the fact that we lost the map.

01:02:05.651 --> 01:02:08.745
- We?
- All right, I’m the jerk who lost the map.

01:02:08.821 --> 01:02:11.984
And I’m the bunny
who saved the card. Voilà.

01:02:13.159 --> 01:02:14.820
Nice going, Bugs.

01:02:17.196 --> 01:02:18.356
Africa.

01:02:19.165 --> 01:02:21.360
Chair people, I reveal to you...

01:02:21.467 --> 01:02:24.198
the whereabouts of the Blue Monkey.

01:02:29.276 --> 01:02:30.435
All right.

01:02:33.513 --> 01:02:37.210
There's a duck in the middle of the map.
Remove the duck.

01:02:37.483 --> 01:02:40.976
Remove the duck! The duck is in the....

01:02:41.221 --> 01:02:42.347
Duck!

01:02:50.631 --> 01:02:55.034
We cannot let a boy, girl, duck, and rabbit
thwart our plans for global domination.

01:02:55.135 --> 01:02:57.535
- Wanna bet?
- A wager?

01:02:57.804 --> 01:03:02.468
$5 says my son will scuttle
your diabolical plans and save the world.

01:03:02.676 --> 01:03:05.543
You're awfully spunky
for a man in your position.

01:03:06.748 --> 01:03:09.716
How do you like that,
Mr. Slap Yourself in Your Own Face?

01:03:09.816 --> 01:03:11.876
Give him a good zets
every once in a while.

01:03:11.985 --> 01:03:13.475
My pleasure.

01:03:13.554 --> 01:03:16.249
Now, I think I'm going to hedge my bet.

01:03:16.357 --> 01:03:19.257
I’m going to unleash
our most vicious operative.

01:03:28.703 --> 01:03:33.504
<i>Mr. Chairman, while we agree that the
Tasmanian Devil is quite vicious...</i>

01:03:33.707 --> 01:03:37.439
<i>if memory serves, he is also really stupid.</i>

01:03:37.712 --> 01:03:40.180
Really? So are you.

01:03:48.256 --> 01:03:49.689
That's a good boy.

01:03:55.296 --> 01:03:57.355
I withdraw my objection.

01:04:13.114 --> 01:04:15.640
This would have been
a lot easier underground.

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:20.154
Come on, it's only another 6,000 cubits
in this here thick direction.

01:04:26.061 --> 01:04:29.258
Look, Granny,
it's that nice boy from next door.

01:04:29.798 --> 01:04:31.493
Little Damian.

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:34.325
How funny seeing you here, dear.

01:04:34.603 --> 01:04:35.797
Hi, Granny.

01:04:35.904 --> 01:04:38.839
Would you and your little friends
like a lift?

01:04:39.608 --> 01:04:41.269
Giddy-up, Dumbo.

01:04:42.244 --> 01:04:45.737
Sure was a lucky coincidence
you showing up just now.

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:48.007
Yes, wasn't it?

01:05:06.803 --> 01:05:08.600
I've discovered my roots.

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:10.764
I've discovered my lunch.

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:18.273
Cry freedom !

01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:32.327
What a fantastic view.

01:05:32.496 --> 01:05:33.962
Unless you're in the audience...

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:38.058
in which case you've been staring
at an elephant's behind for 30 seconds.

01:05:40.538 --> 01:05:42.402
My destiny awaits.

01:05:48.379 --> 01:05:49.744
I guess this is our stop.

01:05:49.846 --> 01:05:52.838
Enjoy the rest of your adventure, children.

01:06:19.743 --> 01:06:23.372
This is the Blue Monkey?
This dime- store bauble?

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:27.849
- I've been rooked. Shafted by the gods.
- Nice going, Daffy.

01:06:27.918 --> 01:06:31.081
I demand recompense.
I want my diamond.

01:06:31.289 --> 01:06:33.882
Where is my humongous rock?

01:06:37.395 --> 01:06:38.692
Pressed duck.

01:06:49.307 --> 01:06:52.071
- This looks like a puzzle piece.
- What?

01:06:52.811 --> 01:06:54.642
Wait a minute.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.462
Are we rich yet?

01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:20.002
Any time now.

01:07:55.642 --> 01:07:58.873
I’m rich. I’m affluent.
My liquidity is assured.

01:08:01.147 --> 01:08:03.878
Daffy, get back here. Don't touch that!

01:08:04.217 --> 01:08:05.878
Let go! Don't you dare!

01:08:05.985 --> 01:08:08.613
- The rock is mine. So close.
- You mind?

01:08:08.688 --> 01:08:11.988
Yes, I mind. I'm the hero.
I should get the treasure.

01:08:12.059 --> 01:08:14.721
The girl, too, but we'll
discuss that later.

01:08:17.531 --> 01:08:21.490
Careful with my diamond. Easy, now.

01:08:29.577 --> 01:08:32.477
Dad, this is for you.

01:08:39.152 --> 01:08:43.055
Why, D.J., why you? Why wasn't it me?

01:08:43.523 --> 01:08:46.151
Just academic curiosity, you understand.

01:08:46.225 --> 01:08:48.421
Gotta go. Bank closes at 5:00.

01:08:48.529 --> 01:08:52.089
- Come on, Daffy, change him back.
- All right.

01:08:52.834 --> 01:08:54.392
Buddy pictures.

01:08:57.537 --> 01:08:59.938
- D.J., pal, you're okay.
- Yeah.

01:09:01.908 --> 01:09:03.273
Give me that.

01:09:03.377 --> 01:09:06.211
- I liked you better as a monkey.
- Thanks.

01:09:07.582 --> 01:09:09.412
That is so sweet.

01:09:09.584 --> 01:09:13.020
Now if you could just
hand over the diamond.

01:09:17.225 --> 01:09:18.693
Immediately!

01:09:19.962 --> 01:09:21.258
My turn.

01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:30.135
Pardon.

01:09:30.973 --> 01:09:32.758
All right, now, I've
come for the diamond.

01:09:32.770 --> 01:09:34.567
I knew it
was you.

01:09:34.777 --> 01:09:38.234
You knew it was me, did you?
You're wrong. Because I’m not me.

01:09:38.312 --> 01:09:39.939
I’m actually....

01:09:41.116 --> 01:09:43.380
I can't. I can't reach over the hat.

01:09:43.452 --> 01:09:46.444
I’d rehearse back at ACME,
but I never wore the hat.

01:09:46.554 --> 01:09:49.456
And now the hat is throwing me off.
Would you....

01:09:49.591 --> 01:09:52.560
Thank you very much. Now, I’m actually....

01:09:55.330 --> 01:09:56.661
Your father.

01:09:57.466 --> 01:09:59.434
- Dad.
- Saw that one coming.

01:09:59.501 --> 01:10:01.401
Look into your heart, D.J.

01:10:01.837 --> 01:10:05.170
- You know it's true.
- No, it can't be true.

01:10:05.507 --> 01:10:07.338
You're right, it isn't.

01:10:09.645 --> 01:10:11.341
Let's do some drills.

01:10:12.181 --> 01:10:14.342
This doesn't make a lick of sense.

01:10:16.252 --> 01:10:18.310
Well, who's laughing now?

01:10:20.023 --> 01:10:23.083
Apparently, no one.
Anyway, give me the Monkey!

01:10:23.159 --> 01:10:25.320
No, forget that, man. You're evil.

01:10:26.695 --> 01:10:28.527
Thank you, but....

01:10:28.764 --> 01:10:33.167
Anyway, Mr. Smith,
let's show this muscle- bound beefcake...

01:10:33.269 --> 01:10:35.760
who I have sometimes been mistaken for...

01:10:35.839 --> 01:10:38.501
what it's like to live in the real world.

01:10:42.112 --> 01:10:46.447
Have you ever been disintegrated in one
place and then reassembled in another?

01:10:46.516 --> 01:10:47.813
Fire away.

01:10:53.656 --> 01:10:55.556
No, you don't!

01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:28.420
I thought they fixed that glitch.

01:11:30.494 --> 01:11:31.654
Mr. Smith is fired!

01:11:31.729 --> 01:11:34.197
I have to do everything myself
around here.

01:11:37.702 --> 01:11:39.999
- Good.
- You....

01:11:47.045 --> 01:11:48.341
Henchmen.

01:11:48.412 --> 01:11:49.538
Dad.

01:11:49.847 --> 01:11:52.042
So this is the remote that works.

01:11:52.951 --> 01:11:56.078
This, my friend,
is the ACME Train of Death...

01:11:56.388 --> 01:11:58.913
which is not good news for your father.

01:11:59.057 --> 01:12:00.455
<i>Don't worry about me, son.</i>

01:12:00.559 --> 01:12:02.925
<i>I've gotten out of worse scrapes
than this one.</i>

01:12:03.028 --> 01:12:05.861
You see, if the Train of Death
doesn't kill him...

01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:08.092
then those crates of TNT will.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.033
Not to mention
the 2- ton anvil hanging over his head.

01:12:11.102 --> 01:12:14.071
And look. There's the Pendulum of Doom.

01:12:14.139 --> 01:12:17.302
What's the Pendulum of Doom
doing there? I did not order it.

01:12:17.410 --> 01:12:19.877
It's overkill. Get rid of it.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:25.407
Now, if you want to
keep your family ''together''...

01:12:26.118 --> 01:12:28.814
I would hand over the Blue Monkey now.

01:12:29.622 --> 01:12:31.886
<i>Don't worry, son. I’m fine.</i>

01:12:38.163 --> 01:12:41.599
- You're a sick man, you know that?
- Get used to it.

01:12:42.235 --> 01:12:44.566
Excuse me? What about my father?

01:12:46.071 --> 01:12:49.007
- He's waiting for a train.
- What? You....

01:12:49.775 --> 01:12:51.675
Where's Marvin the Martian?

01:12:51.978 --> 01:12:56.005
All right, here is the Blue Monkey.
Go put it on the satellite. Go!

01:12:57.583 --> 01:12:59.676
No, you don't, eight ball.

01:13:15.635 --> 01:13:18.537
You'd never catch that rabbit
being this heroic.

01:13:18.639 --> 01:13:21.870
- What's up, doc?
- You're despicable.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.297
Vandals.

01:13:54.141 --> 01:13:57.042
Your friends' efforts
will prove to be futile.

01:13:57.144 --> 01:14:01.080
You see, here is the Blue Monkey,
here is the ACME satellite.

01:14:01.181 --> 01:14:04.913
When the Blue Monkey
is finally docked in the satellite...

01:14:06.353 --> 01:14:08.584
I will transmit a beam around the world...

01:14:08.689 --> 01:14:12.182
which will transform
everyone but me into monkeys.

01:14:12.694 --> 01:14:14.719
Now take them away!

01:14:15.262 --> 01:14:17.026
Don't you think that'll get lonely...

01:14:17.098 --> 01:14:21.262
Mr. All My Friends Swing from Trees
and Pick Fleas Out of Their Furry Butts?

01:14:21.369 --> 01:14:25.567
Lonely? I suppose I could use
a little human companionship.

01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:27.430
Thanks a lot.

01:14:27.942 --> 01:14:30.001
I've seen you notice me.

01:14:30.545 --> 01:14:32.103
I know I'm hot.

01:14:33.282 --> 01:14:36.445
But I prefer someone
with a little more oomph.

01:14:37.018 --> 01:14:39.385
I prefer Mary!

01:14:43.458 --> 01:14:44.925
Hello, Mary.

01:14:45.059 --> 01:14:46.959
We're a cute couple, don't you think?

01:14:47.061 --> 01:14:50.862
Take those future simians away
and lower the Monkey shield.

01:15:06.815 --> 01:15:09.909
Earthlings have
the worst sense of direction.

01:15:12.588 --> 01:15:16.115
What do you know, he fell for it.
I guess I owe you $5.

01:15:33.610 --> 01:15:35.601
Did you order satellite?

01:15:35.978 --> 01:15:37.742
I don't even have cable.

01:15:47.957 --> 01:15:50.619
You know, when I fired that duck...

01:15:50.994 --> 01:15:53.019
I never would have seen this coming.

01:15:53.128 --> 01:15:54.619
Gotta be a way out of this.

01:15:54.697 --> 01:15:58.463
<i>You can get out of this, son.
You've just got to set your mind to it.</i>

01:15:58.535 --> 01:16:01.527
Besides, I’m hearing my dad's voice
in my head.

01:16:01.704 --> 01:16:04.502
Actually, I’m down here, son.

01:16:11.314 --> 01:16:13.714
Hold on, Dad, I'll be right down!

01:16:18.822 --> 01:16:20.222
That was too easy.

01:16:30.634 --> 01:16:32.363
What was that noise, son?

01:16:34.238 --> 01:16:38.174
- You know how I always wanted a dog?
- Yeah?

01:16:38.876 --> 01:16:40.138
I just got one.

01:16:53.757 --> 01:16:56.352
Wait. Maybe he wants to play fetch.

01:16:57.027 --> 01:17:01.088
- Nice mechanical doggy.
- Good dog. Want to play?

01:17:01.565 --> 01:17:04.557
Good boy. Fetch!

01:17:15.614 --> 01:17:18.583
lt looks to be
a deadly mission requiring strength...

01:17:18.683 --> 01:17:20.707
cunning and nerves of steel.

01:17:20.784 --> 01:17:23.776
So good luck, Bugsy,
I'll keep the engine running.

01:17:25.423 --> 01:17:26.912
You tricked me!

01:17:27.292 --> 01:17:28.589
What's up, Darth?

01:17:28.693 --> 01:17:32.287
Now I must incapacitate you
with my bubble gun.

01:17:32.797 --> 01:17:34.196
Ain't that cute?

01:17:35.867 --> 01:17:39.269
Of course you realize this means war.

01:17:51.783 --> 01:17:54.617
You go that way. I’m gonna go this way.

01:18:09.135 --> 01:18:11.228
Bad dog! Sit!

01:18:11.503 --> 01:18:14.064
I don't want to put you
under any added pressure...

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:17.632
but judging by the vibrations
of these train tracks, I've got about...

01:18:17.743 --> 01:18:20.075
one minute and forty- two seconds left.

01:18:20.146 --> 01:18:21.636
Down! Put him down.

01:18:31.792 --> 01:18:34.282
What am I gonna do?
What would Damian Drake do?

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.192
What would Duck Dodgers do?

01:18:36.329 --> 01:18:38.763
Wait a minute. I am Duck Dodgers!

01:18:38.931 --> 01:18:41.627
Yes, I’m going to be the hero
of this picture!

01:18:41.701 --> 01:18:44.000
Duck Dodgers to the rescue!

01:18:54.815 --> 01:18:55.941
Duck....

01:18:58.986 --> 01:19:02.945
It's you- know- who to the rescue!
lt helps if you don't say the name.

01:19:09.029 --> 01:19:10.155
Bad dog!

01:20:05.953 --> 01:20:09.856
Disgusting Earth rodent.
Now to neutralize that duck.

01:20:17.132 --> 01:20:18.621
This can't be good.

01:20:22.971 --> 01:20:27.635
Now the diamond will bathe the Earth
in a monkey- transforming glow.

01:20:27.943 --> 01:20:31.572
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven...</i>

01:20:32.146 --> 01:20:34.980
<i>six, five, four...</i>

01:20:35.417 --> 01:20:37.942
<i>three, two, one.</i>

01:20:39.788 --> 01:20:42.313
Thwarting evil makes me so angry.

01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:49.789
That takes care of that.

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:05.971
Thanks, Daff.

01:21:08.284 --> 01:21:10.513
Darn dark side!

01:21:12.622 --> 01:21:14.111
Are you all monkeys yet?

01:21:30.473 --> 01:21:33.932
Checkmate, Mr. Chairman.
You're going down.

01:21:37.013 --> 01:21:39.312
Come on, say it.
Just a little ''You're my hero''?

01:21:39.383 --> 01:21:41.612
- Nope, sorry.
- Bugs, say it, come on.

01:21:41.684 --> 01:21:44.347
- Not interested.
- No one will ever know.

01:21:47.957 --> 01:21:50.221
I’m really proud of you, D.J.

01:21:50.661 --> 01:21:52.788
I knew I could count on you.

01:21:53.731 --> 01:21:54.857
Yes.

01:21:57.134 --> 01:21:59.363
Dad, I think we should move.

01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:04.567
- What was wrong with Beverly Hills?
- I meant from this spot.

01:22:22.761 --> 01:22:26.356
- I think we scratched it.
- Don't worry, it's a rental.

01:22:26.431 --> 01:22:28.660
You guys, you pulled it off!

01:22:28.732 --> 01:22:31.395
- You pulled it off, all right.
- Give me that.

01:22:31.502 --> 01:22:32.902
Way to go, Daffy.

01:22:33.004 --> 01:22:35.437
You didn't do so bad yourself, stunt boy.

01:22:35.539 --> 01:22:36.904
To set the record straight...

01:22:37.008 --> 01:22:40.739
all credit for saving the human race
goes to Daffy.

01:22:40.845 --> 01:22:42.107
Exactly.

01:22:42.214 --> 01:22:44.944
Oh, no, you don't, buster. You're the hero.

01:22:46.952 --> 01:22:51.286
Wait a minute. Pronoun trouble.
I’m the hero.

01:22:51.389 --> 01:22:52.879
I’m the hero, all right.

01:22:53.425 --> 01:22:55.289
Are you gonna introduce us, D.J.?

01:22:55.393 --> 01:22:58.556
- Dad, this is Kate. Kate, this is- -
- Damian Drake.

01:22:58.630 --> 01:23:02.465
I’m a really big fan...of your son.

01:23:03.869 --> 01:23:07.236
Daff, you achieved your goal
of being a hero.

01:23:07.306 --> 01:23:09.796
Yep, but you didn't achieve your goal...

01:23:09.909 --> 01:23:12.434
of getting me back in your stupid movie.

01:23:13.545 --> 01:23:16.480
- Cut. Great, that's a wrap.
- That's it, guys.

01:23:16.581 --> 01:23:19.141
Remind me to get a new agent, will you?

01:23:19.318 --> 01:23:20.580
Thanks.

01:23:21.253 --> 01:23:23.814
Wait a minute. Maybe we are a team.

01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:27.585
Bugs and Daffy. No, Daffy and Bugs.
What do you think?

01:23:32.564 --> 01:23:34.465
Excuse me, do you remember me?

01:23:34.567 --> 01:23:37.764
I threatened your manliness,
and you got me fired?

01:23:37.936 --> 01:23:39.404
I know you.

01:23:40.072 --> 01:23:41.596
Do I know him?

01:23:41.973 --> 01:23:46.001
You must be someone that I got fired.
See, I get a lot of people fired.

01:23:47.413 --> 01:23:49.938
- You be good now.
- So like I said....

01:23:52.752 --> 01:23:55.744
Not again. He's down again. Are you okay?

01:23:55.955 --> 01:23:58.151
- Come on.
- He said he can do stunts.

01:23:58.257 --> 01:23:59.747
Bugs is here. Gotta go.

01:23:59.826 --> 01:24:01.259
Daffy, you're right.

01:24:01.327 --> 01:24:03.523
- The usual place, Mr. Bunny?
- Very good.

01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:07.532
From now on, you and I are going to be
equal partners in this thing.

01:24:07.634 --> 01:24:09.760
No more second banana for you.

01:24:10.202 --> 01:24:13.138
Thanks, pal. I really appreciate this.

01:24:13.206 --> 01:24:15.696
At last my star is rising.

01:24:15.809 --> 01:24:18.209
All my hopes and aspirations....

01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:26.177
What do you know?
My luck is changing already.

01:24:37.564 --> 01:24:39.156
Go home, folks.
