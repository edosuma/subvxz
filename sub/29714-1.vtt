WEBVTT

01:18.492 --> 01:19.976
There you are.

01:22.565 --> 01:23.565
Hey.

01:25.499 --> 01:27.604
You gonna tell me what
we're doing out here?

01:27.639 --> 01:28.639
Come on.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.093
All right.

01:42.723 --> 01:43.723
- Oh.
- Wow.

01:46.796 --> 01:49.109
There's even more
than last time.

01:49.143 --> 01:50.741
Are you sure we're
supposed to be sneaking up

01:50.765 --> 01:51.973
on a nest like this?

01:52.008 --> 01:56.461
It's a maternity den,
the rocks keep them warm.

01:57.738 --> 02:00.534
Helping their babies grow.

02:04.745 --> 02:06.540
They're so beautiful.

02:10.095 --> 02:11.717
You're beautiful.

03:19.129 --> 03:20.924
Mara, I hate doing
this, you know.

03:23.513 --> 03:24.790
Hush up and smile, Dilly.

03:41.151 --> 03:44.465
Hey, we're looking
for a ride to town.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.469
Come here, Bo, come here, Bo.

03:58.686 --> 04:00.205
Hey, how are you?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.240
I'm fine.

04:05.693 --> 04:06.798
Hi, Sister Slaughter.

04:06.832 --> 04:08.109
Pastor know you're here?

04:09.283 --> 04:10.283
We'll be quick.

04:12.631 --> 04:14.071
It oughta be around
here somewhere.

04:27.819 --> 04:28.854
Oh, got it.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.551
You all right?

04:35.585 --> 04:36.585
Yeah.

04:42.730 --> 04:44.214
Just getting ready for tomorrow.

04:45.940 --> 04:47.220
Is that all you're looking for?

04:49.634 --> 04:50.954
We should get some of these too.

04:51.636 --> 04:52.636
These too.

04:57.055 --> 04:58.988
You girls gonna
be late for worship.

05:02.060 --> 05:03.060
You walk here?

05:05.063 --> 05:06.582
Yeah, but it ain't so far.

05:09.136 --> 05:11.000
I'll give you a
lift, I'm closing up.

05:11.034 --> 05:12.277
We got a dog outside.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.798
I'll meet you in the lot.

05:36.232 --> 05:39.339
Can't believe the party's
tomorrow, are you excited?

05:40.547 --> 05:41.547
Yeah.

05:43.964 --> 05:44.964
'Course I am.

05:48.796 --> 05:49.796
He's late.

05:50.695 --> 05:52.282
We don't mind the wait.

06:11.336 --> 06:13.925
Hey, y'all get in
trouble with my ma?

06:17.963 --> 06:18.963
Hey Augie.

06:23.935 --> 06:25.695
Come on, girl.

06:28.698 --> 06:31.149
Here, let me hold your purse.

06:33.462 --> 06:34.877
I missed you.

06:39.744 --> 06:40.779
Hey.

06:40.814 --> 06:41.814
So you been good?

06:44.852 --> 06:46.406
Yeah, you?

06:49.063 --> 06:50.133
All right, I guess.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.346
All right, scooch in.

07:00.799 --> 07:01.904
- Ready?
- Mmhmm.

07:33.349 --> 07:34.799
Here, careful.

07:58.029 --> 07:59.893
Do you some good
to join us today.

08:03.793 --> 08:06.520
Thanks, Ma, but I'm
already pretty full up today.

08:06.555 --> 08:07.555
That right?

08:08.349 --> 08:10.490
Any more I'd just
be plain greedy.

08:36.205 --> 08:39.207
Mara!
Come on, we're gonna be late.

09:09.618 --> 09:11.412
- Amen.
- Jesus said,

09:11.447 --> 09:14.415
go ye into the world and preach.

09:14.450 --> 09:15.600
- Welcome sisters.
- The gospel.

09:15.624 --> 09:17.971
- Amen, amen, amen.
- Amen?

09:19.869 --> 09:20.905
Amen.

09:22.320 --> 09:26.013
He said, those that believeth
in me and are baptized

09:26.048 --> 09:28.947
- shall be saved, amen?
- Amen.

09:28.982 --> 09:31.605
But those that believeth
not shall be damned,

09:31.640 --> 09:34.504
- shall be damned!
- Amen, amen!

09:34.539 --> 09:35.747
Hallelujah.

09:35.782 --> 09:39.302
These signs shall follow
them that flee in my name,

09:40.994 --> 09:42.996
in my name, shall
they cast out devils.

09:43.030 --> 09:44.584
- Amen!
- They shall speak

09:44.618 --> 09:46.965
- with new tongues, amen?
- Amen.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.174
- They shall take up serpents.
- Amen!

09:49.209 --> 09:51.107
- They shall take up serpents.
- Amen.

09:51.142 --> 09:53.040
And if they drink
any deadly thing,

09:53.075 --> 09:56.596
- it shall not hurt them, amen?
- Amen!

10:37.947 --> 10:40.674
- And so what happened?
- That little one got bit

10:40.709 --> 10:41.709
on the neck.

10:42.918 --> 10:46.369
Family prayed all night, but
he couldn't fight off the venom

10:46.404 --> 10:50.511
and once he passed, the law
was up there in no time.

10:52.513 --> 10:55.551
Hmm, I see.

10:57.622 --> 10:59.451
And since the deceased
was still a minor,

10:59.486 --> 11:02.006
it ain't gonna stop
with him neither.

11:16.434 --> 11:17.677
They out for blood.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.546
Sorry, Daddy, there was a
bit more cleaning tonight.

11:25.581 --> 11:28.273
It's all right, Garret
and I just having a moment.

11:28.308 --> 11:29.550
You hungry?

11:29.585 --> 11:30.724
Yes sir.

11:30.759 --> 11:34.038
- Well, let's go eat, then.
- All right.

11:47.396 --> 11:48.500
7:30.

11:49.743 --> 11:50.882
All right.

11:54.368 --> 11:55.715
Hey, Big weekend ahead of you?

11:57.578 --> 11:58.648
All of us.

12:00.098 --> 12:01.272
Yes sir.

12:04.793 --> 12:06.691
Well, I'll go rest
these old bones.

12:08.382 --> 12:13.146
He's a good man, you try not
to keep him on hold too long.

12:13.180 --> 12:14.388
No, Daddy.

12:14.423 --> 12:16.011
You kids get some rest now.

12:16.045 --> 12:17.564
Yes sir, just got to clean up.

12:36.825 --> 12:37.825
Mara?

12:41.622 --> 12:46.420
I just wanted to say...

12:50.493 --> 12:53.531
Well, I never thought
I'd have this, you know,

12:53.565 --> 12:56.637
a girl like you, taking me on.

13:01.470 --> 13:02.470
But here you are.

13:04.853 --> 13:08.408
You're a beauty, Mara,
not just talking about

13:08.442 --> 13:09.650
that pretty face of yours.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.760
Sometimes I worry you
might think too much of me,

13:15.795 --> 13:16.795
Garret.

13:17.866 --> 13:19.660
It's just the
God's honest truth.

13:23.664 --> 13:24.665
Thank you, Garret.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.808
Well.

13:30.879 --> 13:31.879
I better head out.

13:33.329 --> 13:34.468
Night, then.

14:51.200 --> 14:56.171
Oh loving and kind God
have mercy, have pity on me

14:57.517 --> 15:01.762
and take away the awful
stain of my transgressions.

15:03.764 --> 15:08.390
Oh wash me, cleanse
me from this guilt.

15:09.667 --> 15:11.531
Let me be pure again.

15:12.877 --> 15:16.881
For I admit my shameful deed,
it haunts me day and night,

15:18.883 --> 15:23.888
create in me a new clean heart
filled with clean thoughts

15:24.993 --> 15:28.375
and right desires,
don't toss me aside.

15:28.410 --> 15:31.482
Banished forever
from your presence.

15:31.516 --> 15:33.656
Or take your Holy
Spirit from me.

15:34.968 --> 15:38.765
But restore to me the
joy of your salvation

15:39.904 --> 15:42.389
and make me willing to obey you.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.704
You all twisted up about Garret?

15:53.918 --> 15:58.681
Nerves ain't a sin, you hear me?

16:01.374 --> 16:03.790
Now you just follow the
spirit as close as you can,

16:05.274 --> 16:06.379
he'll guide your path.

16:09.658 --> 16:12.281
'Cause the devil's gonna
do his damnedest to ruin

16:12.316 --> 16:13.696
the goods you got
coming your way.

17:02.090 --> 17:03.090
Hey girl!

17:04.436 --> 17:05.576
How you doing?

17:06.749 --> 17:07.887
How you doing, sweet thing?

17:10.407 --> 17:11.407
Hmm?

17:17.864 --> 17:18.864
Come to help?

17:23.421 --> 17:24.421
Bye.

17:33.776 --> 17:38.333
Sorry, Mara, I
thought there was more.

17:38.367 --> 17:39.299
It's all right.

17:39.334 --> 17:40.990
Still no word from your mama?

17:43.924 --> 17:44.924
I'm sorry, Dilly.

17:47.480 --> 17:50.345
Let's not talk
about her, not today.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.104
Okay.

17:53.589 --> 17:54.970
All right.

17:55.004 --> 17:56.637
Better hustle up, then,
see what these old hens

17:56.661 --> 17:58.111
have in the store for us.

17:58.146 --> 17:59.768
All righty.

18:03.358 --> 18:06.015
- Two colic babies?
- She wouldn't feed them

18:06.050 --> 18:07.465
her milk, you ask me.

18:11.814 --> 18:13.782
And that Casey Jay.

18:14.955 --> 18:16.785
Curse on her poor
mama, that girl.

18:16.819 --> 18:20.616
All right now, a
proposal's been made.

18:22.411 --> 18:24.862
And as sisters of this
community, we are charged

18:24.896 --> 18:28.486
with a serious business,
an important decision.

18:29.625 --> 18:31.524
Figuring what kind of
woman you hope to be

18:32.490 --> 18:34.019
and finding the man who's
gonna help you do it.

18:34.043 --> 18:36.460
Think Connie Ray missed
that point last time around.

18:36.494 --> 18:37.806
All right, hush up.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.808
Harold ain't so bad.

18:39.842 --> 18:42.638
So we'll spend the rest of
the morning making the quilt

18:42.673 --> 18:46.849
and by sundown, Mara's mind
must be made on Garret Booner.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.896
Oh, it's the young 'uns
you got to keep a watch for.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.830
They barely bit me,
still took my thumb.

19:04.660 --> 19:07.387
Holy Ghost shine through
me more than once.

19:07.422 --> 19:08.526
No doubt about that.

19:09.665 --> 19:11.667
What about that boy you raised?

19:16.603 --> 19:17.811
All right.

19:22.022 --> 19:23.403
Let's get after it, then.

19:26.579 --> 19:29.098
Last spring
there was some down here.

19:34.759 --> 19:35.759
You hear that?

19:49.705 --> 19:52.915
Hiding in those rocks,
who knows how many?

19:56.919 --> 20:01.924
Well, I ain't gonna let you
leave here emptyhanded. Go on.

20:21.254 --> 20:24.878
Now remember, we
respect the serpent

20:24.913 --> 20:26.190
but we do not cower to it.

20:28.813 --> 20:29.813
Go on, son.

21:04.332 --> 21:06.057
So this is where you ran off to.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.819
Needed a minute, I guess.

21:15.722 --> 21:17.966
Can't seem to rid
myself of the damn things.

21:20.071 --> 21:21.141
My only vice.

21:25.663 --> 21:27.251
But we all got our
sins, don't we?

21:37.296 --> 21:40.299
You know, I lived a whole
lifetime before I found this place

21:42.093 --> 21:44.717
For years I was lost, wasn't
anybody looking for me.

21:48.237 --> 21:50.550
But that's what it's
like off this mountain.

21:52.276 --> 21:54.692
Buncha dumb sheep, just
wandering in the dark.

21:59.697 --> 22:02.735
And that's when Zeke found
me and brought me here.

22:02.769 --> 22:04.564
- He found you a shepherd.
- Mhmm.

22:05.876 --> 22:07.981
'Cause who you choose, girl,
chooses your whole life.

22:11.916 --> 22:13.116
Guess that's why I'm circling.

22:16.404 --> 22:19.855
'Cause when the devil creeps
in, shrinking you down,

22:21.201 --> 22:23.825
taking your love, you need
someone to see the truth

22:23.859 --> 22:24.860
even when you don't.

22:32.730 --> 22:35.595
Well, I'll leave you to it.

23:16.947 --> 23:17.947
Augie?

23:19.674 --> 23:20.675
You shouldn't be here.

23:20.709 --> 23:21.779
Don't, Mara.

23:22.987 --> 23:23.954
Don't what?

23:23.988 --> 23:25.714
Don't talk to me
like I'm someone else.

23:25.749 --> 23:27.854
I'm sorry, I just don't
know why you're doing this.

23:27.889 --> 23:28.890
Making it harder.

23:30.374 --> 23:31.375
Making what harder?

23:33.826 --> 23:34.826
Mara.

23:36.242 --> 23:38.969
You used to say we was
like the wind, 'member?

23:42.006 --> 23:45.009
No beginning, and no end.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.428
I know.

23:51.982 --> 23:54.294
But things were never
supposed to get this far.

23:56.331 --> 23:57.919
And they can't go any further.

23:59.196 --> 24:01.198
I mean, we're never
gonna make any sense.

24:02.337 --> 24:04.097
We are the only thing
that makes any sense

24:04.132 --> 24:05.444
in this goddamn place.

24:06.928 --> 24:08.388
What's keeping us apart
ain't even real, your daddy,

24:08.412 --> 24:10.863
his religion, it's got
nothing to do with us.

24:10.897 --> 24:12.416
It's not just
his, it's mine too.

24:15.177 --> 24:17.293
I've got the same spirit in
me, why don't you see that?

24:17.317 --> 24:19.354
I'm the only one
who does see it, okay?

24:21.874 --> 24:23.082
I know who you are, Mara.

24:28.950 --> 24:31.331
You don't know anything.

24:55.079 --> 24:57.461
Shoot, Mara, you got to hurry.

24:59.912 --> 25:01.120
I'll hurry, don't worry.

25:03.363 --> 25:05.504
Still want me to
braid your hair?

25:05.538 --> 25:06.538
Yeah.

25:09.197 --> 25:10.267
All right, come sit.

25:20.864 --> 25:23.522
So you made up
your mind, did you?

25:23.556 --> 25:26.076
You gonna braid my hair
or stick your nose in?

25:26.110 --> 25:28.527
Fine.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.494
Well, I mean, he'll
probably treat you nice.

25:35.257 --> 25:37.259
Garret's a good man.

25:37.294 --> 25:41.540
He hears the spirit in a way
that I can't even, you know?

25:43.024 --> 25:44.024
Mmhmm.

25:47.960 --> 25:48.960
I just thought...

25:51.342 --> 25:53.241
What?

25:53.275 --> 25:54.967
Maybe you didn't like him much.

25:58.142 --> 25:59.142
I like Garret.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.979
Maybe it's just time that
I grew up and choose a life

26:07.013 --> 26:10.085
for myself, and it ain't
just a matter of choosing

26:10.120 --> 26:11.500
for this life, is it?

26:16.436 --> 26:18.300
And you should think
about that too.

26:24.962 --> 26:25.962
Braid's done.

26:32.660 --> 26:33.833
I'll be downstairs.

26:56.994 --> 26:58.202
Your mama's dress.

27:01.136 --> 27:02.344
My, you look just like her.

27:04.588 --> 27:06.176
Could hardly believe it fit.

27:09.075 --> 27:10.076
But you ain't her.

27:14.011 --> 27:16.186
The Holy Ghost never
saw you as a stranger.

27:16.220 --> 27:17.566
Now go and take that off.

27:43.040 --> 27:46.216
- Praise God today, amen?
- Amen.

27:47.493 --> 27:49.564
Well, I'm not gonna
preach much today.

27:49.598 --> 27:52.222
I just wanted to say a few
words about my daughter.

27:55.363 --> 27:56.433
The Lord...

27:57.745 --> 28:01.127
He tested her at a very
early age, taking her mama.

28:02.473 --> 28:04.475
But Mara has turned
into a fine girl.

28:06.270 --> 28:11.275
And a good man, a Holy Ghost
man, has asked for her hand.

28:14.623 --> 28:17.109
So then, you settled on it?

28:20.284 --> 28:21.284
My answer is yes.

29:04.052 --> 29:05.226
Hey Augie.

29:05.260 --> 29:06.780
You ain't at the
party with everyone?

29:08.677 --> 29:10.127
Just tired, that's all.

29:12.198 --> 29:14.994
Yeah, ain't much of
a dancing mood either.

29:16.616 --> 29:18.170
Come on, I can drop you.

29:19.481 --> 29:21.552
All right, thanks.

29:28.318 --> 29:30.630
We're hooked up off the
edge of the pastor's lot.

29:32.149 --> 29:35.290
Oh, well ain't that
something to hear.

29:37.637 --> 29:39.570
There's a lot more
to him, you know.

29:41.434 --> 29:43.195
If you just let
yourself find out.

29:43.229 --> 29:45.349
Why don't you just shoot
where you're aiming, Dilly?

29:48.234 --> 29:50.616
Just be nice to
see you at worship.

29:58.175 --> 29:59.418
Yeah.

30:32.865 --> 30:33.865
Mara?

30:34.867 --> 30:37.387
Your dad and I are heading out.

31:11.352 --> 31:13.457
They must have
been waiting for us.

31:13.492 --> 31:14.769
Just let 'em pass.

31:16.150 --> 31:18.083
God's on our side,
boy, remember that.

31:41.796 --> 31:44.557
Mara?

31:44.592 --> 31:46.249
Mara?

31:46.283 --> 31:47.560
What?

31:47.595 --> 31:48.875
There's trouble at the church.

31:50.598 --> 31:51.598
What is it?

31:53.532 --> 31:54.671
Wait, what are you doing?

31:54.705 --> 31:55.775
You coming?

32:05.475 --> 32:09.410
They walked into our
house, into God's house,

32:11.308 --> 32:14.311
and they took the very
thing that allows us

32:14.346 --> 32:19.351
to show our devotion to
him, our love for him.

32:21.594 --> 32:22.594
And why?

32:23.562 --> 32:27.152
Because they don't
understand it.

32:27.186 --> 32:29.948
Because they look down on it.

32:29.982 --> 32:33.296
Because they look down on
it, they look down on you!

32:33.330 --> 32:35.919
On you and you and you!

32:37.472 --> 32:39.785
But our struggle is not
against flesh and blood.

32:41.407 --> 32:46.412
It's not against the man
who stands in our path.

32:47.758 --> 32:49.529
Our struggle is against the
devil that put him there, amen?

32:49.553 --> 32:50.761
Amen.

32:50.796 --> 32:53.523
But our God, our
God is a conqueror

32:55.249 --> 33:00.219
and our belief in him
is a sword against those

33:00.979 --> 33:01.945
that would undo us, amen?

33:01.980 --> 33:02.946
Amen.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.016
And this mountain?

33:04.051 --> 33:05.707
This mountain is our shield.

33:13.370 --> 33:14.647
Excuse me.

33:20.964 --> 33:23.035
Your hands aren't meant for
driving, you know that.

33:23.070 --> 33:25.624
I got scared you was in
trouble like last time.

33:27.039 --> 33:29.283
Garret wouldn't allow it.

33:29.317 --> 33:30.732
He said the serpents were his.

33:32.044 --> 33:33.632
How long will they keep him?

33:35.565 --> 33:36.565
I can't say.

33:37.981 --> 33:40.570
He's gonna lose his job at
the weld, that's for sure.

33:42.710 --> 33:44.574
Come on, let's go home.

34:42.494 --> 34:43.840
Morning, Dilly.

34:44.703 --> 34:45.703
Pastor.

34:47.119 --> 34:48.362
Is everything all right?

34:48.396 --> 34:51.744
Everything's fine, Dilly,
just came to check in on you,

34:51.779 --> 34:53.539
that's all.

34:53.574 --> 34:54.815
Oh.

34:54.851 --> 34:56.507
Jolene still gone?

34:56.542 --> 34:58.993
Yeah, gone for
about a month now.

35:01.168 --> 35:02.928
Dishes been spoiling
for a while.

35:02.962 --> 35:04.032
Yeah, for too long.

35:05.033 --> 35:06.033
Yes, sir.

35:08.106 --> 35:12.351
But that ain't on you,
girl, do you understand me?

35:14.974 --> 35:16.976
And you ain't got to
drown in it no more

35:19.634 --> 35:21.567
and you gonna stay
with us from now on.

35:26.779 --> 35:28.688
A child ain't meant to be
separated from her blood,

35:28.712 --> 35:29.713
but your mama...

35:30.611 --> 35:32.164
She made her choice
a long time ago.

35:32.199 --> 35:34.373
Now you got a choice
you got to make.

35:37.859 --> 35:40.103
She can't be a part
of you no more.

35:45.729 --> 35:47.973
Well, what if she comes back?

35:48.007 --> 35:49.571
Well, then she'll come
back to an empty house

35:49.595 --> 35:51.804
'cause there ain't gonna
be nothing here for her.

35:53.703 --> 35:54.703
You understand me?

36:01.745 --> 36:03.195
Yeah.

36:03.230 --> 36:07.579
All right, then,
I'll leave you girls to it.

36:20.005 --> 36:22.801
Hey, can I ask you something?

36:22.835 --> 36:24.043
Mmhmm?

36:25.183 --> 36:27.150
It's just...

36:27.185 --> 36:28.979
My ma never told me much.

36:30.843 --> 36:32.742
About what?

36:32.776 --> 36:33.776
Well...

36:35.641 --> 36:38.472
You know what happens before
a wedding can take place?

36:42.821 --> 36:45.927
I'm supposed to see Sister
Slaughter, that's all I know.

36:48.033 --> 36:49.033
Oh.

37:28.832 --> 37:31.145
Did you hurt yourself?

37:31.179 --> 37:32.250
Garret, you're back.

37:34.700 --> 37:36.115
I didn't expect you so soon.

37:38.186 --> 37:40.119
Even a week in
jail's hard on a man.

37:42.087 --> 37:45.573
I'm afraid the troubles
ain't over yet.

37:50.233 --> 37:51.510
Tell me if I hurt you?

38:05.697 --> 38:06.974
They came for us before.

38:08.596 --> 38:11.910
They tore up the church,
took Daddy in the middle

38:11.944 --> 38:12.944
of the sermon.

38:16.259 --> 38:17.709
I don't know how
long he was gone.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.851
I was little, so
a while I guess.

38:23.162 --> 38:24.232
Must've been scary.

38:34.829 --> 38:35.829
Garret.

38:37.694 --> 38:39.696
What you did for the
church, for Daddy...

38:41.767 --> 38:42.767
Thank you.

38:46.013 --> 38:47.566
I did it for you, Mara.

38:49.396 --> 38:50.742
You must know that.

38:53.710 --> 38:57.024
Now I love your daddy
and the church, well,

38:57.058 --> 38:59.267
the church gave me a new
life, you know, it drove

38:59.302 --> 39:00.890
the demons from my heart.

39:03.202 --> 39:06.654
But it is you that
keeps 'em gone.

39:08.415 --> 39:11.038
Ain't never laid eyes
on something so pure.

39:16.008 --> 39:18.942
I would do anything to
keep you, Mara, anything.

40:27.252 --> 40:29.185
Jesus shed blood for us.

40:32.913 --> 40:33.913
For our healing.

40:37.124 --> 40:42.094
He died on that cross to
break the devil's power.

40:44.131 --> 40:48.791
Now the devil, the devil,
the devil, the devil.

40:50.068 --> 40:52.104
The devil has made home
in this little boy,

40:54.728 --> 40:56.005
in this little child of God

40:57.489 --> 41:01.942
- but the Lord can save him.
- That's right.

41:03.115 --> 41:05.393
- Oh yes he can.
- That's right, that's right.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.433
Now we must not be deceived

41:11.745 --> 41:14.126
by the lies of the
material world.

41:15.438 --> 41:18.959
The Lord is the only medicine
that this boy needs, amen?

41:20.305 --> 41:21.409
Amen.

41:27.105 --> 41:29.383
Look at me, son.

41:35.838 --> 41:40.843
I say out, sickness, I say get
out, get out, get out, devil,

41:42.189 --> 41:44.294
get out, you have no place
here, let the Holy Ghost

41:44.329 --> 41:46.504
shine through, heavenly
father, shine through him,

41:46.538 --> 41:50.162
Clean his heart, Clean his
lungs, get out...

41:54.753 --> 41:58.067
Get out, get out, get out!

42:09.388 --> 42:11.218
Mara, you'll see Sister
Slaughter first thing

42:11.252 --> 42:12.771
in the morning, you hear me?

42:15.498 --> 42:16.498
Yes sir.

43:04.443 --> 43:06.376
All right, stand up then.

43:12.175 --> 43:13.452
Go on, lay back.

43:16.317 --> 43:17.560
Why?

43:17.595 --> 43:19.227
There's a process has
to happen before a wedding

43:19.251 --> 43:20.425
can take place.

43:20.459 --> 43:22.185
We all had to go
through it, come on.

43:33.472 --> 43:35.889
Okay, hold yourself there now.

44:13.374 --> 44:14.582
You can sit up.

44:35.224 --> 44:36.224
Leave us?

44:53.656 --> 44:55.209
Does Garret know?

45:05.254 --> 45:07.118
I suppose your daddy
didn't neither.

45:13.365 --> 45:14.365
No.

45:23.548 --> 45:25.205
Best keep it that way for now.

45:57.237 --> 45:58.997
Thank you, oh Lord,
for this bounty.

45:59.032 --> 46:02.138
May it nourish our bodies as
you have nourished our souls.

46:02.173 --> 46:03.588
In Jesus name, amen.

46:04.520 --> 46:06.108
- Amen.
- Amen.

46:14.047 --> 46:15.047
Mmm, mmm.

46:17.188 --> 46:20.398
That's good.

46:29.200 --> 46:30.442
What's rustling you, girl?

46:33.273 --> 46:34.273
You all right?

46:41.281 --> 46:42.351
Think I'll turn in.

46:50.704 --> 46:54.121
You know how females are,
always getting riled up

46:54.156 --> 46:55.398
about something.

46:58.436 --> 46:59.644
Damn, this is good, Dilly.

47:01.301 --> 47:03.717
Just wait til
you try the sweet potatoes.

47:05.098 --> 47:07.617
That's where I'm headed.

47:07.652 --> 47:08.722
Mmm.

47:40.512 --> 47:41.512
Hey.

47:42.756 --> 47:43.756
Hey.

47:44.896 --> 47:45.896
Hey!

47:47.278 --> 47:48.278
Hey.

47:50.557 --> 47:51.834
Didn't mean to interrupt.

47:52.766 --> 47:53.766
No.

47:59.566 --> 48:01.326
Everything okay?

48:04.709 --> 48:06.884
Everything's just
so mixed up right now

48:06.918 --> 48:10.680
and I'm trying to see it and
I'm trying to see his plan,

48:10.715 --> 48:14.201
what I'm meant for,
but I can't see it.

48:14.236 --> 48:16.100
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I can't see anything.

48:16.134 --> 48:20.552
It's all right, come here,
it's all right, it's okay.

48:21.657 --> 48:22.657
I'm sorry.

48:32.185 --> 48:33.600
Mara, Mara, don't.

48:39.537 --> 48:41.711
I think you should
just go, okay?

48:47.683 --> 48:49.236
I don't understand.

48:49.271 --> 48:51.342
Look, I'm trying real
hard to do what you asked.

48:53.447 --> 48:54.447
Just walk away?

49:01.317 --> 49:02.801
I got a place down in Leedsburg.

49:04.942 --> 49:05.942
Lined up a job.

49:10.257 --> 49:11.257
You're leaving?

49:12.535 --> 49:13.535
Yeah.

49:14.572 --> 49:16.539
I mean, there's nothing
left for me here.

49:30.588 --> 49:32.590
I better let you
get back to it, then.

49:39.907 --> 49:41.633
Maybe I'll see
you before you go.

49:45.016 --> 49:46.016
Yeah.

49:53.024 --> 49:54.024
Okay.

50:22.502 --> 50:25.574
You been messing around
with the pastor's daughter?

50:25.608 --> 50:26.851
What?

50:26.885 --> 50:29.336
No, Mama, I got to go.

50:29.371 --> 50:30.371
She's pregnant.

50:31.752 --> 50:32.752
What?

50:33.616 --> 50:35.618
You tell me, is that
your baby, August?

50:53.705 --> 50:54.705
My God.

50:55.811 --> 50:57.675
You could burn for this.

50:57.709 --> 50:59.815
Just leave God out of
this for once, Ma, please.

50:59.849 --> 51:01.748
You'll be punished in
this life and the next.

51:01.782 --> 51:02.783
Stop!

51:02.818 --> 51:04.751
God'll have another
man raising up your own,

51:04.785 --> 51:06.270
claiming yours for his.

51:06.304 --> 51:07.685
Don't say that!

51:07.719 --> 51:10.412
You have to repent, you
have to beg for forgiveness

51:10.446 --> 51:14.381
or he will deny you as
you have denied him.

51:14.416 --> 51:17.384
Okay, you have to make
this right, August, please.

51:17.419 --> 51:18.420
You have to.

51:44.791 --> 51:45.791
Hey.

51:48.139 --> 51:49.139
Hey.

51:51.936 --> 51:53.455
I'll take one of those too.

51:56.389 --> 51:57.389
Of course.

51:58.149 --> 51:59.149
Thank you.

52:04.086 --> 52:07.331
You know, I took a walk
in nature this morning,

52:08.470 --> 52:13.337
my property, and I just
looked and I listened.

52:16.029 --> 52:19.481
He calls to us, the
Holy Ghost does,

52:20.758 --> 52:25.418
whispering in voices in
the wind, in the rain,

52:26.177 --> 52:27.523
in the serpent's rattle.

52:31.044 --> 52:33.495
But if you get quiet,
you can hear him.

52:36.083 --> 52:37.740
Can you hear him?

52:43.194 --> 52:44.194
I do.

52:48.406 --> 52:49.752
I do.

52:51.202 --> 52:53.377
Why, the Lord calls a
child of our church home.

52:56.069 --> 53:01.005
Come on up here, Augie, come
on up here, he is calling.

53:06.148 --> 53:09.634
Are you ready to submit
yourself before the Holy Ghost?

53:15.468 --> 53:16.917
Yes, I am.

53:16.952 --> 53:17.987
Hallelujah.

53:19.955 --> 53:22.129
Praise Jesus,
hallelujah, praise God.

53:27.997 --> 53:29.723
Thank you, Jesus.

53:32.968 --> 53:33.968
Holy Ghost.

53:35.867 --> 53:37.386
Praise be to God.

53:40.078 --> 53:41.632
Thank you Jesus.

53:48.225 --> 53:50.675
Praise be, thank you, Jesus.

53:51.883 --> 53:54.196
- Hallelujah.
- Thank you, Jesus.

54:24.053 --> 54:25.572
Okay.

55:55.938 --> 56:00.598
It burns, oh, God,
it burns, it burns so bad.

56:04.291 --> 56:05.810
Okay, let's see
how bad it got you.

56:12.748 --> 56:17.684
Please, I need a
doctor, please, please.

56:17.719 --> 56:20.273
A doctor ain't gonna
do nothing for you, son.

56:20.307 --> 56:23.241
Only an honest faith is gonna
get you through this, Augie,

56:24.381 --> 56:25.875
an honest faith and
your belief in him.

56:25.899 --> 56:28.730
He's asking you to
believe in him, son.

56:28.764 --> 56:29.764
Believe in him.

56:33.838 --> 56:35.875
Ma, Ma, please, please.

56:43.848 --> 56:44.848
Please.

56:46.299 --> 56:48.163
You listen to your Pastor, boy.

56:53.064 --> 56:55.170
You have to save your
breath for your prayers.

56:55.204 --> 56:56.205
You're being tested.

56:58.138 --> 56:59.208
We're all being tested.

57:01.107 --> 57:02.142
Come.

57:13.084 --> 57:14.776
Jesus, we pray
that you'll hold him

57:14.810 --> 57:18.296
and you'll surround him and
he's loved, in this moment.

57:29.963 --> 57:31.793
Came to see if
you needed anything.

57:31.827 --> 57:34.105
No, darling, just prayers.

57:35.037 --> 57:39.835
And rest, best we go
downstairs and give it to him.

58:56.429 --> 58:58.338
The Lord said when there
are two or more gathered

58:58.362 --> 59:00.157
in my name, there
will I be also.

59:01.848 --> 59:05.127
Let us lift up our dear
Augie with a song of our Lord

59:05.162 --> 59:09.062
Jesus Christ, help him beat
the devil that is cutting

59:09.097 --> 59:11.306
like acid through his veins.

59:11.755 --> 59:14.930
You remember, the devil made
a home in this young child,

59:14.965 --> 59:18.278
young Jed's lungs, and the
prayers had cast him out?

59:23.180 --> 59:28.185
Those were your prayers that
saved this innocent child

59:28.979 --> 59:30.774
and the Lord will
hear our call again.

59:32.396 --> 59:33.811
He will join in our song.

59:33.846 --> 59:36.365
Let the prayer of the faithful
raise the one who is sick

59:36.400 --> 59:39.990
and the Lord will heal
him, in Jesus name, amen.

59:40.922 --> 59:42.579
Amen.

59:51.070 --> 59:53.486
He's gonna be fine.

59:53.520 --> 59:55.453
Just cut a little
too deep, is all.

59:56.489 --> 59:57.939
Better stitch him up quick.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.086
We got clean rags.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:17.234
Can't keep still.

01:00:17.268 --> 01:00:18.097
All right.

01:00:18.131 --> 01:00:19.131
I can do it.

01:00:43.122 --> 01:00:46.435
Um, is he gonna be okay?

01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:50.267
Hush now, girl,
let's let them do this

01:00:50.301 --> 01:00:51.648
with a little privacy.

01:01:01.727 --> 01:01:03.142
You as good as lied to me.

01:01:06.317 --> 01:01:08.906
Let me thinking Garret was
the daddy of that baby.

01:01:12.634 --> 01:01:15.050
I couldn't find my
way to the truth of it.

01:01:20.021 --> 01:01:21.919
Well, God's
punishing you both now.

01:01:48.981 --> 01:01:50.361
Mara's still tending to him?

01:01:52.053 --> 01:01:53.606
Well, we all got to do our part.

01:01:57.506 --> 01:01:59.405
Think she's done
more than enough now Lemuel.

01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:04.341
We're a community, son,
and he needs her help.

01:02:05.998 --> 01:02:08.103
Poor boy was asking
to go to the hospital.

01:02:12.418 --> 01:02:15.628
He goes to town, the
law'll be here in no time.

01:02:15.662 --> 01:02:17.699
It'll be for you.

01:02:21.496 --> 01:02:25.086
Well, then pray,
and quiet your heart

01:02:26.570 --> 01:02:29.400
because mine ain't even
whispering.

01:02:49.627 --> 01:02:50.767
Mara.

01:02:51.457 --> 01:02:52.630
Mara.

01:02:54.701 --> 01:02:56.196
I've got to tell the
others you're awake.

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.670
You have to help me.

01:02:57.704 --> 01:02:59.534
I have to tell
the others you're awake.

01:02:59.568 --> 01:03:02.192
No, no, don't,
stay, listen, listen,

01:03:02.226 --> 01:03:06.541
I need a hospital, please, I
ain't gonna make it otherwise.

01:03:06.575 --> 01:03:07.575
Don't say that.

01:03:09.406 --> 01:03:13.203
The Holy Ghost called to you
in the night and you heard him.

01:03:13.237 --> 01:03:14.549
He called to you, you heard him.

01:03:14.583 --> 01:03:16.965
- No.
- He ain't gonna abandon you.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.035
Listen to me.

01:03:19.312 --> 01:03:21.521
I didn't hear the
Holy Ghost, okay?

01:03:22.591 --> 01:03:23.972
I never have.

01:03:27.182 --> 01:03:28.666
Mara, I did it for you.

01:03:32.394 --> 01:03:36.122
Mara, I will die here, you
have to help me, please.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:38.780
Please.

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:40.471
I think you better rest, okay?

01:03:42.749 --> 01:03:44.337
And if you won't
pray, then I will.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:49.170
Okay, okay, okay, then
can you at least just

01:03:49.204 --> 01:03:50.999
do it here with me?

01:04:41.808 --> 01:04:43.776
What in Christ...

01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:44.915
What are you up to, girl?

01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:46.710
- Get off me.
- You tell me.

01:04:46.744 --> 01:04:47.790
Take your goddamn hands off her.

01:04:47.814 --> 01:04:49.057
- Get off me.
- You tell me,

01:04:49.092 --> 01:04:50.372
what are you up to, you tell me.

01:04:50.403 --> 01:04:52.198
That's enough, boy!

01:04:54.131 --> 01:04:56.616
Devil's at work here,
poisoning her, poisoning you.

01:04:58.377 --> 01:05:01.414
Now you take yourself
home, girl too.

01:05:04.417 --> 01:05:06.868
Come on.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:07.903
Go.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:30.305
You will stay away
from him and that house.

01:05:45.389 --> 01:05:46.389
Mara?

01:05:51.671 --> 01:05:53.328
What are you doing?

01:05:58.851 --> 01:06:00.542
Just listening to the wind.

01:06:25.636 --> 01:06:27.500
I made you a plate
if you're hungry.

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.020
Thanks, Dilly.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.179
Mara?

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.632
Where are you going?

01:06:55.666 --> 01:06:57.530
Looking in on Augie.

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:01.740
You coming?

01:07:02.535 --> 01:07:06.298
Oh, you're gonna
be the death of me.

01:07:06.332 --> 01:07:08.403
- Yeah, I'm coming.
- Hurry.

01:07:29.459 --> 01:07:30.943
Do you hear that?

01:07:44.819 --> 01:07:45.992
Morning, Pastor.

01:07:46.027 --> 01:07:47.453
I ain't got business
with you, Dilly.

01:07:47.477 --> 01:07:48.477
Get in the car, Mara.

01:08:33.729 --> 01:08:35.939
Thought he'd find his
way out of it by now.

01:08:38.562 --> 01:08:40.805
I'm so sorry.

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.359
Sorry?

01:08:42.394 --> 01:08:45.430
My boy's still fighting,
what are you sorry for?

01:08:45.466 --> 01:08:46.466
I...

01:08:48.434 --> 01:08:49.573
It's...

01:08:49.608 --> 01:08:51.541
It's just sad seeing
Augie this way.

01:08:56.096 --> 01:08:57.616
Go on, finish your prayers.

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:41.349
This ain't gonna
end well for you, son.

01:09:43.662 --> 01:09:46.009
She'll settle down
after the wedding.

01:09:46.042 --> 01:09:47.942
Not if you don't
start acting like a man.

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:51.773
Teach her to be a wife,
it ain't my place to.

01:09:52.947 --> 01:09:54.707
That's God's law,
that ain't mine.

01:10:36.024 --> 01:10:37.024
Mara?

01:10:41.029 --> 01:10:42.479
Better get the soaking tub.

01:10:57.287 --> 01:10:58.564
Mara?

01:11:00.946 --> 01:11:01.946
Go on.

01:12:28.689 --> 01:12:33.521
There are limits to what
I'll let you do to me, Garret.

01:12:54.266 --> 01:12:55.785
This is our fault, Zeke.

01:12:59.858 --> 01:13:01.204
We let him slip away.

01:13:02.826 --> 01:13:03.931
Just sat here.

01:13:05.691 --> 01:13:08.245
Waiting by as the devil
hisself crept into his heart.

01:13:27.333 --> 01:13:30.992
And now we're gonna lose him,
we're gonna lose our boy.

01:13:32.131 --> 01:13:34.202
He ain't gonna make it
through another night.

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:44.178
Not with that arm, he ain't.

01:13:44.212 --> 01:13:45.224
Zeke, what are you saying?

01:13:45.248 --> 01:13:47.353
I'm saying we ain't
gonna stand by no more.

01:13:48.354 --> 01:13:50.194
But it ain't supposed
to be up to us no more.

01:13:50.218 --> 01:13:52.013
The spirit must run his course.

01:13:53.152 --> 01:13:55.603
God took your thumb,
wasn't your daddy.

01:13:59.158 --> 01:14:01.195
He would've if he had to.

01:14:32.088 --> 01:14:34.124
Dilly, how is he?

01:14:38.784 --> 01:14:42.167
He's got that look on
him, same as the rest.

01:14:42.201 --> 01:14:44.652
No, he made it
through the first night.

01:14:48.069 --> 01:14:49.657
You best say your goodbyes.

01:14:51.348 --> 01:14:53.316
I know you two was close.

01:14:57.354 --> 01:14:58.908
I'm sorry.

01:15:06.881 --> 01:15:07.986
This is my fault.

01:15:09.297 --> 01:15:11.403
Not his, I'm the
one that should be punished.

01:15:11.437 --> 01:15:12.437
Hey.

01:15:13.992 --> 01:15:16.408
Loving somebody
ain't a sin, Mara.

01:15:19.549 --> 01:15:20.549
It's all right.

01:15:29.145 --> 01:15:30.318
You don't understand.

01:15:33.114 --> 01:15:34.114
What?

01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:40.225
I got his baby in me.

01:15:47.404 --> 01:15:50.546
Oh no.

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:51.580
Oh.

01:15:54.411 --> 01:15:56.034
Mara.

01:16:34.313 --> 01:16:35.521
Would y'all go get him?

01:16:36.661 --> 01:16:38.621
Tonight ain't the night
for that kind of behavior.

01:16:48.224 --> 01:16:49.224
I'll go get him.

01:17:00.443 --> 01:17:01.443
Garret.

01:17:04.447 --> 01:17:06.518
Hey, there you are.

01:17:13.042 --> 01:17:14.906
The Pastor send
you to get me or...

01:17:16.321 --> 01:17:18.530
Do you just love me?

01:17:20.221 --> 01:17:22.568
Please, Garret, stop,
what are you doing?

01:17:22.603 --> 01:17:24.087
Stop acting like that.

01:17:24.122 --> 01:17:28.057
Oh.

01:17:28.091 --> 01:17:32.578
Okay, Dilly Pickett telling
me how to act.

01:17:32.613 --> 01:17:35.029
Okay.

01:17:35.064 --> 01:17:36.962
This ain't about me.

01:17:36.997 --> 01:17:37.997
Mmhmm.

01:17:38.999 --> 01:17:40.138
I came to talk to you.

01:17:41.553 --> 01:17:43.210
Go on.

01:17:43.244 --> 01:17:45.419
What important thing
do you have to tell me?

01:17:47.593 --> 01:17:48.593
Um...

01:17:50.527 --> 01:17:52.495
Go on, little bird.

01:17:56.085 --> 01:17:57.120
It's about Mara.

01:18:05.991 --> 01:18:07.855
What about Mara?

01:18:07.890 --> 01:18:11.376
I'm worried that
she's losing herself.

01:18:13.447 --> 01:18:15.552
She ain't listening
to the spirit no more.

01:18:17.969 --> 01:18:19.315
What makes you think that?

01:18:24.527 --> 01:18:25.977
Because of Augie.

01:18:33.053 --> 01:18:35.055
Better go on, tell me.

01:18:36.401 --> 01:18:38.852
Matthew seven tells us to
ask and it shall be given.

01:18:40.198 --> 01:18:42.959
Heavenly father, I am asking
you to reach your strong hands

01:18:42.994 --> 01:18:46.445
inside this young man's
heart to be his strength

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.033
in his time of need.

01:18:52.555 --> 01:18:54.626
You trying to make
a fool of me, huh?

01:18:55.627 --> 01:18:56.627
No.

01:19:00.597 --> 01:19:03.014
Everything that I got, mmhmm,

01:19:03.048 --> 01:19:07.190
everything that I am, I
fucking gave to you, Mara.

01:19:09.054 --> 01:19:10.054
All of it.

01:19:13.403 --> 01:19:14.473
I loved you, Mara.

01:19:18.546 --> 01:19:20.203
I loved you more than anything.

01:19:23.482 --> 01:19:24.482
Christ, I still do.

01:19:26.554 --> 01:19:28.694
But it is killing me.

01:19:32.353 --> 01:19:33.941
You're killing me.

01:19:38.635 --> 01:19:40.741
You understand that?

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:43.606
- I'm sorry...
- Beauty, oh?

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.644
Why'd you lie, huh, why'd
you say that you loved me?

01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:51.269
I didn't.

01:19:57.413 --> 01:19:58.413
Whoa, whoa, hey.

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:01.796
What'd you say?

01:20:05.524 --> 01:20:07.009
You're hurting me.

01:20:07.043 --> 01:20:08.631
What did you say?

01:20:08.665 --> 01:20:11.565
Garret, you're hurting me.

01:20:28.996 --> 01:20:30.826
Garret, Garret!

01:20:31.861 --> 01:20:33.138
What in God's name?

01:20:36.176 --> 01:20:39.731
You don't understand,
just let me, let me...

01:20:47.497 --> 01:20:50.707
Lemuel, she's a whore, Lemuel.

01:20:52.295 --> 01:20:54.711
Hey, wait a minute, no, no,
hey, hey, just wait a minute,

01:20:54.746 --> 01:20:55.436
no, hey, hey.

01:20:55.471 --> 01:20:56.782
You get outta here right now.

01:20:56.817 --> 01:20:58.094
No, you can't put this on me.

01:20:58.129 --> 01:21:00.683
Go or I swear to
God I'll bury you.

01:21:00.717 --> 01:21:02.581
Don't put this on me, Lemuel.

01:21:04.169 --> 01:21:05.722
That's not my baby in her.

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:09.820
Daddy.

01:22:20.970 --> 01:22:22.592
It's time to get clean, girl.

01:23:11.469 --> 01:23:12.884
Harold got more from the vet.

01:23:32.904 --> 01:23:34.423
Tell the boys we're ready.

01:24:17.259 --> 01:24:20.779
Satan seduced Eve.

01:24:20.814 --> 01:24:22.747
So that he could
pollute all mankind.

01:24:25.025 --> 01:24:30.203
Woman is the first sinner
and she must be cleansed.

01:24:33.896 --> 01:24:37.589
Come on, girl, come
on and get clean.

01:26:14.479 --> 01:26:18.656
All right, let her get
cleaned, let her get cleaned.

01:26:25.663 --> 01:26:27.665
By the serpent we'll purify you.

01:26:30.150 --> 01:26:32.946
By the serpent
we'll cleanse you.

01:26:40.402 --> 01:26:42.714
The serpent will cleanse you.

01:27:06.082 --> 01:27:07.532
Hold him down.

01:27:12.503 --> 01:27:14.988
Augie, I'm here, I'm here, boy.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.804
The Lord has forgiven you.

01:28:49.841 --> 01:28:51.498
The Lord has heard your prayers.

01:28:52.913 --> 01:28:54.259
He has forgiven you, Mara.

01:28:58.954 --> 01:29:03.786
Augie needs help, and not
the kind that we can give him.

01:29:05.650 --> 01:29:06.650
Hey.

01:29:07.514 --> 01:29:09.861
You walk out that door,
you don't come back.

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.661
You understand me?

01:29:23.254 --> 01:29:24.254
Bye, Daddy.

01:29:25.808 --> 01:29:26.809
Mara, Mara?

01:29:46.104 --> 01:29:47.209
What are you doing, girl?

01:29:47.243 --> 01:29:48.555
I came for Augie.

01:29:58.634 --> 01:29:59.877
He needs a doctor.

01:29:59.911 --> 01:30:03.225
What he needs is to find
his faith and God'll answer.

01:30:03.259 --> 01:30:07.988
He won't, not Augie, he's
not like us, he never was.

01:30:08.023 --> 01:30:10.750
I won't hear this, what you're
saying'll put my boy under,

01:30:10.784 --> 01:30:13.373
bury him so deep Jesus
himself won't find him.

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:14.408
Hope.

01:30:15.996 --> 01:30:17.860
We ain't got no more time.

01:30:17.895 --> 01:30:18.975
He'll be gone before sunup.

01:30:18.999 --> 01:30:20.035
That's enough.

01:30:20.069 --> 01:30:21.726
No, it ain't, honey.

01:30:23.279 --> 01:30:24.660
We ain't got no more time.

01:30:29.009 --> 01:30:32.979
You told me that I needed
to find someone who sees me

01:30:33.013 --> 01:30:37.811
like you see each other,
through and through.

01:30:41.850 --> 01:30:43.299
That's Augie for me.

01:30:45.025 --> 01:30:46.579
And I aim to be that for him.

01:30:49.133 --> 01:30:51.031
And I ain't gonna
let him down anymore.

01:30:52.412 --> 01:30:55.104
He asked me to take
him off this mountain.

01:30:55.139 --> 01:30:56.899
That's what I'm
gonna do, you hear?

01:31:04.942 --> 01:31:06.115
I hear you.

01:31:09.602 --> 01:31:12.812
Come on, keys in the truck.

01:31:17.057 --> 01:31:18.057
Come on.

01:31:19.197 --> 01:31:21.096
You're gonna be okay.
