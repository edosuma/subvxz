21:02.302 --> 21:04.179
LOGAN: Hey, what's--
[boom]

21:04.262 --> 21:07.099
[screaming]
[rapid popping]

21:09.726 --> 21:10.936
[coughs]

21:18.986 --> 21:20.237
Thank you

21:20.320 --> 21:22.656
for all these colors on me.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.033
I like this.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.160
I'm happy, like a rainbow.

21:27.244 --> 21:30.372
- Look at you.
How can you not get mad?

21:30.455 --> 21:32.457
- 'Cause I'm too smart
for you.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.419
And you. And you.
Ha-ha.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.129
- Logan.

21:37.212 --> 21:38.714
I'm proud of you.

21:38.797 --> 21:39.548
I'm gonna tell Dean Rivers

21:39.631 --> 21:41.591
that you've succeeded.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.468
No more anger management classes
for you.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.470
- Appreciate it,
Mr. Higgley.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.729
- We didn't think
you could do it.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.064
- We thought for sure
you'd get mad over that.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.899
- Just listen closely.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.736
[shouting] You people
are gonna pay for this!

22:00.819 --> 22:02.612
You're gonna pay
to have my hair fixed.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.698
You're gonna pay
to have my skin cleaned.

22:04.781 --> 22:07.284
You're gonna pay
for everything you did.

22:07.367 --> 22:09.828
- Logan, are you angry?

22:09.911 --> 22:11.121
- Angry?

22:11.204 --> 22:13.040
I'm nine miles past angry!

22:13.123 --> 22:15.417
And if you think I'm screaming
at you now,

22:15.500 --> 22:16.752
just wait till I--

22:21.840 --> 22:23.467
- You were right, Zoey.

22:23.550 --> 22:25.927
Logan was just waiting
until I left.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.641
- Whoops.

22:36.354 --> 22:37.773
- Aww!

22:37.856 --> 22:39.608

22:39.691 --> 22:41.943
a well-adjusted human being

22:42.027 --> 22:44.654
is having the ability
to face frustration

22:44.738 --> 22:49.034
yet remain calm
and not get angry.

22:49.117 --> 22:50.368
- Hey, can I borrow a pen?

22:50.452 --> 22:52.746
- Don't hassle me!
