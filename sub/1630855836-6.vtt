WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:02.534
- I made something for you.

00:02.669 --> 00:03.569
- Oh, beautiful, kookoo.

00:03.704 --> 00:04.836
- For a clear head.

00:04.905 --> 00:06.371
- We have a lot of history.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.107
And I don't know if
I can change.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.041
If we can change together.

00:10.077 --> 00:12.710
- Donor screening told me
I had a son in thompson.

00:12.747 --> 00:15.647
The greatest gift I could've
gotten is to find you.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.583
- It was my girlfriend
mel's idea.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.818
- Are you still in touch?
- No, but I miss her.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.621
- I was alone.
- You are not alone anymore.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.224
- Darius was my brother.
I couldn't save him.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.758
- Coming through.
- You can trust him.

00:26.827 --> 00:29.261
- I trust you because we tell
each other everything.

00:31.565 --> 00:32.998
(gasps)

00:33.133 --> 00:36.001
(heavy breathing)

00:36.136 --> 00:38.804
(tense music)

00:49.984 --> 00:51.416
(pill bottle rattles)

00:51.485 --> 00:53.485
- You okay?
Your shoulder bugging you?

00:53.521 --> 00:54.953
- Yeah.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.955
I barely sleep anymore.

00:57.024 --> 01:00.893
And when I do,
I keep dreaming about my mom.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.428
- Do you want me
to clear out of here,

01:03.431 --> 01:05.697
Go back to my room
so you can get some rest?

01:05.766 --> 01:06.965
- No.
- No.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.967
- No. I'm awake now.

01:08.969 --> 01:11.570
And that means
you're awake now, too.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.672
(♪ watch out ladies ♪
by red money)

01:21.215 --> 01:23.515
(radio interference)

01:25.052 --> 01:27.252
- Nope. Not enough
coffee for that.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.522
(tires screeching)

01:30.657 --> 01:31.924
Whoa...

01:32.526 --> 01:34.259
(ominous tone)

01:35.763 --> 01:37.863
Hey! Are you okay?

01:40.868 --> 01:44.536
(opening theme)

01:51.479 --> 01:53.111
Hey, are you okay?

01:53.147 --> 01:54.812
- Don't come any closer!
- I'm a paramedic.

01:54.849 --> 01:56.582
I can help, okay?
- Yeah, right.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.016
Do you see how bad my luck is?

01:58.085 --> 01:59.885
What are the chances that
the first person to find me

01:59.887 --> 02:01.887
Is a paramedic
and not a serial killer?

02:02.022 --> 02:03.889
- I have an ambulance,
I can turn the siren on

02:03.891 --> 02:05.657
For you if you want, yeah?
- Don't you have like

02:05.659 --> 02:07.125
A badge or something?
- I don't, no.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.526
I'm a training paramedic.
I don't get one

02:08.562 --> 02:09.961
Until I graduate.
- Yeah, it's exactly something

02:09.997 --> 02:12.230
A serial killer would say.
- Um...

02:13.367 --> 02:14.699
Do you know what a stethoscope
feels like?

02:14.735 --> 02:16.502
- Yeah?
- Um... Kind of.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.271
- Yeah.
- Oh, you need a shave.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.241
- Thanks.
- Is this it?

02:22.376 --> 02:24.042
Okay!
- It's good?

02:24.078 --> 02:25.644
- Just don't disappoint me
and kill me.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.579
- I promise.
- Okay. It's a hazard of my job.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.948
- Are you a crime boss?
- Kindergarten teacher.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.316
We're way too trusting.

02:31.385 --> 02:34.452
- Yeah, look,
I got to put my stethoscope

02:34.522 --> 02:36.488
Down your collar. Actually,
I'll go over your nightie.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.655
It's okay. I'll just go.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.325
- Right, I'm wearing a nightie.
Great.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.894
Fantastic.

02:42.029 --> 02:45.063
I just moved up here actually.
Um, you know, it was warm out

02:45.065 --> 02:46.531
And I thought
I would try camping.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.400
And then I woke up
in the middle of the night

02:48.469 --> 02:50.269
In my tent and I was
itching like crazy.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.604
And my eyes are so swollen
I can't see anything.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.006
- I know. Black flies
just hatched.

02:54.141 --> 02:55.307
If you're not from here

02:55.442 --> 02:57.009
Or you don't have immunity,
it can be bad.

02:57.144 --> 02:58.277
Your airways sound clear.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.611
I'll give you some
antihistamine,

02:59.647 --> 03:01.079
Take you to the hospital,
get you checked out.

03:01.148 --> 03:02.547
Probably just give you steroids
and send you home.

03:02.616 --> 03:06.018
Do you have anyone
to keep an eye on you or...?

03:06.020 --> 03:08.620
- No, um... I don't really know
anyone here, yet, so...

03:08.755 --> 03:10.989
- Okay, well, I can see
if I can get tch to admit you.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.624
I'm friends with one
of the med students there.

03:12.759 --> 03:15.026
Kind of...
- Okay, thanks.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.295
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.230
So, what do I call you?

03:18.232 --> 03:19.831
Scruffy?
- It's jeremy.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.833
- Rosie.
(nowak): How romantic!

03:21.835 --> 03:24.369
Just you, me,
and several townies.

03:24.504 --> 03:26.371
- I know, but if you can't
get out of your shift

03:26.407 --> 03:28.574
At the whiskey hatch, I can
bring date night to you.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.642
- As soon as bodie gets up
to speed behind the bar,

03:30.777 --> 03:32.711
I'll get some time off.
Then I'll take you

03:32.780 --> 03:35.247
On a real date.
- Whoa...

03:38.419 --> 03:39.784
It's from my mom.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.255
I didn't know she and my
stepdad were getting married.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.791
- You don't like him?
- No, no. Anthony's great,

03:45.926 --> 03:49.127
But... Things are
complicated with my mom.

03:49.129 --> 03:51.396
She blames me for darius.

03:51.531 --> 03:52.831
- Tristan...

03:54.067 --> 03:55.466
That's nuts.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.669
- Going home is complicated.

03:57.705 --> 04:00.672
- Last night was hot, daddy.

04:00.807 --> 04:03.041
- Yeah, it was.
Same time next week?

04:13.287 --> 04:14.486
(door opens and shuts)

04:15.856 --> 04:16.888
- Hey, nowie.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.623
- Something happen
with you and luke?

04:18.626 --> 04:20.358
- Nope, just a hook-up.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.395
Luke and I are open.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.896
I thought tristan told you.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.702
I'm going to hit the shower,
yeah...

04:32.606 --> 04:33.905
- Look, I saw him
with the hook-up

04:33.907 --> 04:35.840
At chopper's party.
It's not a big deal.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.709
- I know it's not a big deal,
I just thought

04:37.711 --> 04:39.577
We told each other everything.
- We do!

04:39.579 --> 04:41.813
- So why did you feel like
you couldn't tell me that?

04:41.815 --> 04:43.448
- It's just...

04:43.517 --> 04:45.584
I didn't think it was something
that you needed to know.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.187
(beeping)

04:49.189 --> 04:51.590
- Right...
- Nowak...

04:52.726 --> 04:54.526
We'll talk about it
when I get back. Okay?

04:54.528 --> 04:56.194
- Yeah.
- Alright.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.364
(sighs)

05:04.004 --> 05:06.538
- Ms. Highway,
how's your shoulder?

05:06.540 --> 05:07.673
Looks like somebody was busy

05:07.808 --> 05:09.674
When they should've been
at home resting.

05:09.677 --> 05:13.144
Your paper, I'm impressed.
This is strong work.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.213
And I think ready
for another set of eyes.

05:15.249 --> 05:16.848
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.351
Dr. Henry fergus
is an infectious disease

05:19.353 --> 05:21.353
Specialist from winnipeg.
He comes up to consult

05:21.488 --> 05:22.888
Once a month.

05:22.890 --> 05:25.357
If we can get him
to review your paper,

05:25.426 --> 05:27.492
It can go a long way
to getting it published.

05:27.627 --> 05:30.895
- Wow, that would be amazing.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.563
- He only endorses
one paper a year.

05:33.801 --> 05:37.169
But he does like the bison
at the thompson steak house.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.505
If you can impress him,
we might be able

05:40.507 --> 05:42.174
To get him to read your paper.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.977
- I've never been
to a lunch like this before.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.846
What do I do?
What do I say?

05:47.915 --> 05:49.580
What do I wear?

05:49.616 --> 05:52.384
- Formal lunch attire.
Nice skirt and blouse.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.353
<i> - Dr. Yana to the er.</i>
- See you at noon.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.254
<i> - Dr. Yana to the er.</i>

05:56.290 --> 05:58.456
(gentle music)

05:58.492 --> 06:00.692
(phone ringing tone)

06:00.694 --> 06:03.128
<i>(hayley): Whoa, an actual call.</i>
<i> What's up?</i>

06:03.130 --> 06:05.397
- Hey, uh, minor emergency.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.199
What do you know
about blouses?

06:09.002 --> 06:10.802
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.004
- Madison was supposed to have
him while I'm on call today,

06:13.073 --> 06:15.574
But her car broke down
so she's at the shop.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.509
- I wasn't sure I'd get to see
this little guy again.

06:17.644 --> 06:18.810
Can I hold him?

06:19.946 --> 06:21.579
- Yeah. Yeah...

06:22.483 --> 06:24.582
- He's got jo's eyes.
(chuckles)

06:24.584 --> 06:25.750
Yours too.

06:28.122 --> 06:29.821
Oh, those cheeks!

06:29.857 --> 06:32.357
Oh, my gosh!
Oh! Such a big boy!

06:32.359 --> 06:35.560
- Cheeks, those are mine.
(chuckles)

06:35.695 --> 06:37.429
Mom always said I looked
like a little chipmunk.

06:38.365 --> 06:41.633
Uh...My adoptive mom,
of course.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.503
- You know, I'm surprised
you don't have a sitter, austin.

06:46.506 --> 06:48.005
- Yeah, um...

06:48.976 --> 06:50.241
Yeah, money's kind of
tight right now.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.310
But you know, maybe when
madison's done school.

06:52.312 --> 06:54.312
(coughing)

06:54.314 --> 06:55.781
I'm sorry.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.516
(coughing)

06:58.552 --> 07:01.319
You okay?
- It's just the renal disease.

07:01.388 --> 07:02.921
It's annoying
when your ankles swell,

07:02.990 --> 07:06.124
But it's worse when the fluid
gets in your chest.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.059
(baby cooing)

07:08.128 --> 07:09.461
But listen...

07:10.831 --> 07:12.864
I want to help you, austin.

07:12.999 --> 07:15.333
So you can get a sitter
or, or daycare.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.436
I've done well in my life.

07:18.571 --> 07:20.738
And I haven't had anyone
to share it with.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.607
- Look,

07:22.609 --> 07:26.611
That's a really, a really
generous offer, but...

07:26.746 --> 07:28.747
If you feel like you need
to offer me money

07:28.749 --> 07:32.150
So I give you my kidney...
- Austin...

07:32.152 --> 07:34.686
I didn't come here
to get anything from you.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.455
(beeping)

07:38.892 --> 07:41.026
- Crap, madison is still
at the mechanic.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.761
But I have patrol.
- Hey,

07:42.896 --> 07:44.095
I can watch him.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.599
Yes! Listen, I have nieces.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.134
I have lots of experience

07:49.136 --> 07:51.602
Watching munchkins
as small as this.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.639
Look, I understand
if you don't want my money.

07:54.774 --> 07:57.174
But my time
doesn't cost a thing.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.646
- Okay.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.450
Make sure he stays bundled up,
he gets cold easily.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.552
- Okay.
- Check the temperature
on the milk because...

08:07.621 --> 08:09.754
- Go on! Go on!
- Alright.

08:09.756 --> 08:12.424
Okay, kingsley, thank you.

08:12.426 --> 08:13.892
- We're good, we're good.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.693
Hey, it's your grandpa.

08:15.695 --> 08:17.829
Did daddy teach you
about cricket?

08:19.065 --> 08:20.665
- We're supposed to get
a lot of rain.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.134
Better get this done
so you don't get any leaks.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.204
You got a real traffic jam
up here.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.940
- My barney was up there
every spring,

08:29.009 --> 08:31.342
Cussing like a sailor!

08:31.378 --> 08:33.277
He hated heights.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.080
Are you sure
you don't want a cookie?

08:35.082 --> 08:37.482
They're chocolate chip.
- Maybe just one.

08:37.617 --> 08:38.884
- Okay.

08:40.454 --> 08:43.120
(grunts)
- it's a big jam.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.890
(tense music)

08:45.893 --> 08:47.325
Ugh, I can't reach...

08:47.460 --> 08:49.761
(grunts)

09:02.376 --> 09:04.242
(screams)

09:07.514 --> 09:09.013
- Hey, guess what?

09:09.082 --> 09:10.514
I talked chopper into
switching shifts with you

09:10.551 --> 09:12.550
So we can fly on 933 together.

09:12.586 --> 09:16.520
Look, I know you'd rather be
captain of your own ship, but...

09:16.557 --> 09:18.756
Flying medevac has its perks.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.461
- Thank you
for making today easier.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.232
- Whoa!

09:27.367 --> 09:28.967
I knew this locker room
saw a lot of action.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.935
Crystal would always say,
"oh, it's just a locker room,

09:31.004 --> 09:32.570
Jer, it smells like socks."
I knew it.

09:32.639 --> 09:33.938
Sorry, I'm late.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.674
I had to get a patient
settled at the hospital.

09:35.809 --> 09:36.941
(beeping)

09:37.010 --> 09:39.210
- Oh, rock'n'roll time!

09:39.212 --> 09:40.478
Try, to keep up, rook.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.246
(plane engine roars)

09:42.316 --> 09:44.081
- Does it look bad?

09:44.117 --> 09:46.751
- Uh... You know, nolan,

09:46.820 --> 09:48.386
I've seen worse.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.655
(indistinct mumbling)
- what?

09:50.657 --> 09:52.690
- The rack on my truck.
- Okay, don't move your head

09:52.726 --> 09:54.092
And try not to talk,
okay, nolan?

09:54.161 --> 09:55.559
I'm going to have
a closer look.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.096
Alright, this is close
to a lot of major veins

09:59.132 --> 10:00.832
And arteries. Looks like
we're going to need our friends

10:00.901 --> 10:02.300
From the bear falls
fire department

10:02.302 --> 10:03.835
To help us cut him off
without too much movement.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.970
- What? No, no, my truck!
- Okay, just try to stay still,

10:06.039 --> 10:07.271
Okay, nolan?

10:07.307 --> 10:08.839
(jeremy): Alright,
catheter's good to go.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.776
- Put your thumb here.
You're just gonna suction.

10:11.911 --> 10:13.378
There you go.
- Yeah, alright.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.113
- Yeah. Suction as much
blood as possible,

10:15.115 --> 10:17.248
Keep the airway clear.
I'm going to call the bffd.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.582
- Hey, man, what's up?

10:18.619 --> 10:20.385
- Please, please.
Don't wreck my truck.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.053
- No, I get it,
I love my wheels too.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.721
But it's safer to leave
the hook in there, okay?

10:23.790 --> 10:25.523
We might nick a vein
or artery and make it worse.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.692
- I'm a screw-up.

10:27.694 --> 10:31.863
My entire life is one
mess after the other.

10:31.998 --> 10:35.333
But this new business,
I worked really hard

10:35.402 --> 10:36.868
To turn things around.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.803
If they wreck my truck,

10:38.839 --> 10:41.839
Okay, I'm still just a screw-up.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.942
- I know, I know. Just try
to hold still, okay, man?

10:43.944 --> 10:45.509
(choking)
whoa, whoa! Stef, stef!

10:45.545 --> 10:47.112
Stef! Stef, get over here!
He nicked something,

10:47.114 --> 10:48.713
I think he nicked something!
Uh, he just kept moving!

10:48.849 --> 10:50.381
- Okay, okay. We can't wait
for the fire department.

10:50.384 --> 10:51.850
We're gonna have
to pull him off.
- What?

10:51.852 --> 10:53.217
- I'll pull up.
You support from the bottom.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.752
As little movement as possible.
- Alright.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.221
- You up for this?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.455
- Okay. Three, two, one.

10:57.524 --> 10:58.923
(gurgling, blood gushing)

10:59.926 --> 11:01.225
45-year-old male.
Heavy bleeding after

11:01.261 --> 11:03.895
Removal of a foreign object.
- Holding pressure here.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.096
You got it?

11:07.567 --> 11:08.966
- Good work, rook.

11:09.869 --> 11:10.769
- What do you mean,
"good work?"

11:10.904 --> 11:12.570
He's bleeding out,
he could die.

11:12.572 --> 11:13.637
- We arrived on time,

11:13.674 --> 11:15.106
We delivered
the best possible care

11:15.241 --> 11:16.941
To the best of our abilities.
That's a good call.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.710
- Yeah, well,
what if he doesn't make it?

11:18.712 --> 11:20.845
- You can't judge success
on this job on the outcome.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.580
Only on the process.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.982
And our process today
was exactly what
it needed to be.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.751
The only way to survive
on an ambulance

11:26.787 --> 11:29.987
Is to give compassionate care
without getting attached.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.856
The minute you let it
get personal...

11:33.193 --> 11:34.558
Okay, look, look.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.462
I get it.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.396
It got...

11:39.433 --> 11:41.198
It got really personal
for me once, too.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.600
I almost had to quit.

11:44.071 --> 11:47.005
The only way
I could keep going...

11:47.007 --> 11:49.207
Was by finding a way
to separate myself.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.942
You're going to have
to do that, too.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.843
Because if you can't, jeremy,

11:54.881 --> 11:56.214
It's better for you
and your patients

11:56.349 --> 11:57.615
To get out now.

12:07.827 --> 12:10.361
- Crystal. Fergus
is already at the table.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.263
You look great.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.898
- It's alright?
I'm not used to wearing

12:13.900 --> 12:15.700
Anything this tight
around my neck.

12:15.835 --> 12:18.102
- I know. Lunches like this
make me miss my scrubs

12:18.105 --> 12:21.205
Where the real work gets done.
Okay, your paper's strong,

12:21.241 --> 12:24.108
But fergus is old-school
academia.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.976
So when setting up your case,

12:26.012 --> 12:28.246
Only use information
that you can cite.

12:28.315 --> 12:31.048
- I cited all my references
in my paper.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.484
- I just suggest leaving
the part out

12:33.520 --> 12:34.986
About how you come
to know about

12:35.121 --> 12:38.189
Photorhabdus luminescens
from old family stories.

12:39.693 --> 12:41.626
Colloquial knowledge,
it doesn't fly with fergus.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.194
And I'd hate for him
to discredit you

12:43.329 --> 12:45.896
Before he even had a chance
to hear what you had to say.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.232
- Yeah, okay.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.870
(soft jazz music)

12:59.012 --> 13:01.212
- And that's in addition
to her experience

13:01.347 --> 13:03.281
As a flight nurse.
It's not every year

13:03.350 --> 13:05.549
That I mentor a student
like crystal.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.485
- Can I have some
horseradish over here?

13:10.089 --> 13:11.556
- She's written a paper

13:11.691 --> 13:14.225
On a fascinating case
from the er.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.093
- Did I tell you about
my fellow?

13:16.129 --> 13:18.863
Sharp lad.
Needs to work on his putt.

13:18.865 --> 13:21.332
But he's writing a paper
on c. Diff.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.771
- Can you imagine

13:26.840 --> 13:29.974
Laying on a cold,
empty battlefield

13:30.010 --> 13:32.209
Hours after taking
a bayonet to the stomach,

13:32.245 --> 13:33.878
Convinced you're going to die,

13:33.880 --> 13:36.380
Only to see that your guts
are glowing in the dark?

13:37.517 --> 13:39.383
And when you miraculously
wake up the next morning

13:39.419 --> 13:42.120
Still alive,
you might remember that glow

13:42.255 --> 13:44.522
And think that something
magical happened.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.658
Well, angel's glow
is a documented phenomenon

13:47.727 --> 13:49.193
From the civil war.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.595
And there's a theory
that it's caused

13:50.730 --> 13:53.031
By photorhabdus luminescens.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.832
But it was only a theory

13:54.868 --> 13:58.402
Until this man came
into our er and proved it.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.140
- Photorhabdus luminescens?

14:03.976 --> 14:05.543
- Ms. Highway diagnosed it.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.078
We did a culture to confirm.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.380
- Pretty arcane knowledge
for a med student.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.549
- I've always been fascinated
by glowing wounds

14:11.551 --> 14:13.450
Ever since I heard
about it as a kid.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.420
In nursing school.

14:17.557 --> 14:18.923
- And you've written
a paper on it?

14:18.925 --> 14:20.691
- I've reviewed it myself.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.427
But it would be so helpful

14:22.562 --> 14:25.697
To get someone of your level
of expertise on it.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.565
- Send it to me.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.138
- Oh, this is the wrong room.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.206
Looking for rosie.
She's like, about this tall...

14:36.243 --> 14:37.841
Fancy nightie, super itchy.

14:37.878 --> 14:40.177
(chuckling)
- here I was dumb enough

14:40.213 --> 14:41.946
To hope you might come visit me.

14:43.182 --> 14:44.849
- I was just waiting to hear
about another patient.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.184
How are you?
How are you feeling?

14:46.319 --> 14:48.052
- Good. A little less itchy.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.488
- Oh, good.
- Who's your other patient?

14:50.623 --> 14:52.924
And please tell me
it's something more embarrassing

14:52.926 --> 14:54.459
Than being allergic
to bug bites.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.728
- No, it's a little
more serious.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.697
- Are they going to be okay?

15:00.767 --> 15:02.199
- Well, we're still waiting
to see, but...

15:02.269 --> 15:04.068
Apparently,
it was a good call so...

15:04.937 --> 15:05.970
Just because it's a good call,

15:06.039 --> 15:07.472
Doesn't mean he's going
to be okay.

15:08.608 --> 15:09.974
I'm starting to think
that maybe

15:09.976 --> 15:11.575
I'm not cut out for it.

15:11.611 --> 15:12.777
- Why not?

15:14.080 --> 15:15.813
- Well, we're supposed
to care enough to help people,

15:15.882 --> 15:18.782
But then just let it go.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.086
Yeah, I don't think
I can do that.

15:23.623 --> 15:27.091
- You know, before you came,
I was feeling pretty rough.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.426
I just moved up here.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.927
I don't know anyone

15:29.963 --> 15:32.297
And when you're alone
and sick, it's...

15:33.500 --> 15:34.832
Seeing you made me feel like
there was at least

15:34.834 --> 15:36.834
One other person
who cared about me.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.169
So...

15:38.304 --> 15:39.970
Maybe it's not such a bad thing

15:40.006 --> 15:41.306
If you have a hard time
letting go.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.975
- Yeah, I guess.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.313
- I'll bet you a date

15:49.316 --> 15:51.516
That your other patient
is going to be okay.

15:52.919 --> 15:54.719
- I don't think that's something
you should ever

15:54.721 --> 15:56.587
Bet on in this job.

15:56.723 --> 15:57.989
- Yeah, maybe not.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.924
But how else am I gonna
get you to ask me out?

16:00.059 --> 16:02.727
(gentle music)

16:02.862 --> 16:04.128
(chuckles)

16:06.066 --> 16:07.665
- Anywhere you want to go,
we'll go.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.434
I just feel terrible
that we waited so long

16:09.436 --> 16:11.335
To actually do it.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.804
Oh, god. I hate
to miss your appointment,

16:13.840 --> 16:15.206
But I have to finish up
this project

16:15.208 --> 16:17.608
So I can take time off work.
Alright?

16:17.744 --> 16:19.810
Look, if your oncologist
says that you're safe to travel,

16:19.846 --> 16:21.145
Then I will book it
all tonight.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.546
And we'll go.
We'll go for as long

16:22.582 --> 16:25.616
As we can for as much
time as you have left.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.151
- I'm just happy that
we get to have

16:27.286 --> 16:28.853
One last adventure together.

16:28.922 --> 16:31.155
- Uh, tony, you know
that there's...

16:31.290 --> 16:33.591
- You're ready to go.
Right, tony?

16:33.660 --> 16:34.993
- Okay, I'll see you later,
alright?

16:35.128 --> 16:36.527
- Okay.
- Okay. I love you.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.833
- Okay, how much
to keep you two quiet?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.367
- So you do know

16:43.436 --> 16:45.369
That this is just
a routine follow-up?

16:45.372 --> 16:46.504
- I'm in remission.

16:46.573 --> 16:47.839
It's been a couple
of months.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.373
- But you're lying
to your partner.

16:49.442 --> 16:52.243
He thinks you're really sick.
- I was really sick.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.846
This is the second time
that I've had cancer.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.850
The first time,
jeff promised me

16:58.985 --> 17:01.452
As soon as I was better
that we would finally travel.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.787
And I did get better.
So he fell right back

17:03.823 --> 17:07.058
Into working all the time,
and not making enough time

17:07.060 --> 17:11.295
For things like travel,
for things... Like me.

17:13.132 --> 17:15.399
Look, I almost died twice.

17:16.302 --> 17:17.702
I love jeff.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.537
But I'm not waiting
for that to happen again

17:19.606 --> 17:21.272
To finally start living.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.476
Sometimes it's better
to leave things out.

17:26.913 --> 17:28.246
- Hey, guys.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.813
Hello, tony.
- Hi.

17:30.483 --> 17:31.749
- Off we go.

17:33.486 --> 17:36.888
- He has the right
to patient confidentiality.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.455
- Do you think he's right?

17:38.491 --> 17:41.559
That it's better
to keep things a secret?

17:43.797 --> 17:48.098
- With cancer, you get
so focused on surviving,

17:48.134 --> 17:49.433
On just getting through it.

17:49.436 --> 17:52.570
And in a way,
it's easier that way.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.105
Because it's all
you can focus on.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.942
But when it's done
and you have to deal

17:57.944 --> 18:00.244
With all the leftover
emotions...

18:02.449 --> 18:04.782
Sometimes you just want
to escape from it all.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.321
- Welcome to sunny winnipeg.

18:11.357 --> 18:14.324
The current local time
is 5:23 p.M.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.994
The weather is perpetual winter.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.929
Winnipeg towers, skymed 911.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.598
Final runway, 1--

18:20.733 --> 18:22.666
What the hell was that?
- Must have hit a bird.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.136
- Oh, god, it's a whole flock.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.337
- What do we do now?
- We took one in the intake!

18:27.373 --> 18:28.940
(alarm beeping)
proceed with the landing.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.542
- Right engine failure.
- It's okay, it's okay, tony.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.177
It's okay.
- Hold on to your butts.

18:33.179 --> 18:35.078
(plane engine roaring)

18:39.085 --> 18:41.085
- You know, you'd think
it'd be better knowing

18:41.220 --> 18:43.754
That it's not human blood,
but somehow this is worse.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.557
- Patient okay?
- Dropped him off at oncology.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.026
He's doing a lot better
than poor 911.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.262
- Ywg doesn't have
a 200 engine on hand

18:51.264 --> 18:53.964
So we're going to have to get it
trucked in from thunder bay.

18:54.033 --> 18:57.235
- Damn it! Stuff always
happens on date night.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.237
- Can you call dispatch,
get them to book us a hotel?

18:59.372 --> 19:00.871
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.040
- You okay?

19:03.176 --> 19:04.909
- Skymed is stretched
with this expansion

19:04.911 --> 19:06.310
And I have to answer
for every penny,

19:06.346 --> 19:08.145
And that is a lot of pennies.

19:08.214 --> 19:09.813
Remember how I said
we just need a few more

19:09.849 --> 19:11.982
Contracts to stay afloat?
Kenora health are interested,

19:12.051 --> 19:13.784
But we need to prove
that we can bounce back

19:13.853 --> 19:15.319
From stuff like this fast

19:15.355 --> 19:17.855
So they know that we can handle
the increased call load.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.456
Oh, god.

19:19.458 --> 19:20.791
- Hey, you know
what's good for headaches?

19:20.827 --> 19:22.660
- Hmm?
- Hotels.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.194
With king-size beds.

19:24.230 --> 19:25.963
- Are you a nurse?
- I am.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.531
And those are my orders.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.201
- I'm still gonna be here
for another couple hours.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.135
- I'll leave a key
at the front desk.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.671
- Okay.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.206
- We're grounded in winnipeg.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.908
We had this intense
cancer patient and...

19:37.911 --> 19:39.977
I've been thinking about
this morning.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.413
I think we need to talk, milosz.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.282
I'll just be
at the hotel tonight.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.049
<i>- Let's talk when you get home.</i>

19:47.420 --> 19:49.487
- Okay...
<i> - See you tomorrow, tristan.</i>

19:50.289 --> 19:51.756
- So...

19:51.891 --> 19:53.090
What are we doing tonight?

19:53.092 --> 19:56.494
- Uh, room service,
maybe some sudoku?

19:56.629 --> 19:59.263
- Um, hi?
Night off in a big city.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.198
There's a village,
we have to go out.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.000
Hayls, gay bar tonight?

20:04.070 --> 20:05.703
- Uh...
- C'mon, it's not like

20:05.705 --> 20:07.237
You have any other plans.

20:08.107 --> 20:09.974
- One drink.
- Hey!

20:09.976 --> 20:12.376
- Okay, fine. One drink.

20:14.614 --> 20:17.314

20:19.919 --> 20:22.119
- Wish we weren't
in our flight suits.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.654
- Hey, it's better than
our birthday suits.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.389

20:29.762 --> 20:31.262
I'll go get us our first round.

Is that doubles?

20:40.072 --> 20:41.339
Great, I'll do that.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.099

21:08.234 --> 21:09.733
- Should've known
with those cheekbones.

21:10.703 --> 21:11.935
It's probably for the best.

21:12.005 --> 21:13.570
That's the only russian I know.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.773
- Beer?
- Actually, whiskey.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.508
Neat, I hate beer.
- Hmm.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.378
Feels like another
country up here.

21:21.447 --> 21:22.780
Clearly, I overdressed.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.448
- Yeah, the only suits
we get in here

21:24.484 --> 21:25.850
Are canadian tuxedos.

21:26.886 --> 21:29.453
Work trip?
- Mining conference.

21:29.588 --> 21:32.789
So, what is there to do
that's gay up here?

21:34.193 --> 21:36.527
- Watch drag race
in your hotel room.

21:36.596 --> 21:37.928
At least that's what
my boyfriend says.

21:39.231 --> 21:40.298
- Lucky guy.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.005
- Still good with that
ginger ale, buddy?

21:51.811 --> 21:52.877
Keep your eye on that guy.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.345
- Yup.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.613
(phone dings)

22:03.256 --> 22:05.156
Quiet night in, eh?

22:05.291 --> 22:07.691
- More dancing.
The human body

22:07.760 --> 22:09.626
Was meant to dance, baby.

22:09.662 --> 22:13.297
- I can dance to any song,
any beat,

22:13.432 --> 22:14.965
Except country.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.900
- See? That's what
I was telling wheezer

22:16.936 --> 22:18.836
In bed this morning!
Country...

22:19.505 --> 22:21.605
- Uh... Oh...

22:21.607 --> 22:22.906
- You didn't hear that.

22:22.942 --> 22:26.310
- Oh, we most certainly did
just hear that.

22:26.445 --> 22:29.180
- Wheezer is a snack.
- Mm-hmm.

22:29.315 --> 22:31.515
- I'm going to get another
round, my treat,

22:31.650 --> 22:33.984
If you both pretend
that you didn't hear that.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.186
- Oh, yeah. Sure, sure thing.
- Yeah.

22:36.255 --> 22:38.656
- Woo!
(laughing)

22:39.926 --> 22:41.458
- Straight people, am I right?

22:45.398 --> 22:47.198
God, it feels good
to be at a gay bar again.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.366
- You move around a lot?

22:50.036 --> 22:51.902
- I was born in syria.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.871
But we moved to montreal
when I was a kid.

22:54.741 --> 22:57.208
- Wow, that must have been hard.

22:57.210 --> 22:59.009
New country, new language.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.478
- Yeah.

23:00.613 --> 23:03.080
I had to get used to having
a new english name.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.216
And uh...

23:05.351 --> 23:07.952
Plus, there was the gay thing.

23:09.122 --> 23:10.287
Yeah.

23:10.423 --> 23:12.022
What about you?

23:12.959 --> 23:16.293
- Home is complicated
for me, too.

23:17.763 --> 23:20.564
You know, I miss it
and my family,

23:20.633 --> 23:22.233
But I also...

23:23.503 --> 23:26.203
Don't. It's just...
- Complicated.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.306
I get it.

23:29.308 --> 23:30.774
- You know,

23:30.843 --> 23:34.845
Maybe home isn't a place,
you know?

23:34.881 --> 23:38.915
Maybe it's more of a feeling.

23:40.386 --> 23:45.189
- Yeah. Or a connection
between two people.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.124
- Yeah.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.295
- Well, lookie here!
We've got some top gun cosplay

24:02.942 --> 24:05.075

alright, we need some more

24:05.077 --> 24:07.611
Bodies up on this stage.

24:07.746 --> 24:09.613
Well, well, well...

24:09.748 --> 24:11.448
You know the rules, people.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.517
Anybody who steps
on my stage

24:13.653 --> 24:16.954
Has to do a body shot!

24:17.023 --> 24:19.556

24:29.168 --> 24:32.168

- Take it off!

24:40.313 --> 24:41.578
(laughing)

24:46.786 --> 24:49.053
- Since we're virgins at this,

24:49.188 --> 24:50.921
I'll keep it simple.

24:50.990 --> 24:54.992
Follow the lime.

24:59.398 --> 25:00.931

<i> - I can't, bodie.</i>
<i> We need the money.</i>

26:44.436 --> 26:45.902

I told you to watch him
and you left the till wide open.

it was full.

out of your last paycheck.

27:07.759 --> 27:09.159
- What?
- You heard me, you're fired.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.061
- Nowak, I need this job.

thought of that

it all up, eh?

27:23.075 --> 27:24.375

- no.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.011
No, I think
my relationship's over.

27:51.737 --> 27:53.370
Hi.
- Hi.

27:54.674 --> 27:56.039
- Did you wait up for me?

27:56.042 --> 27:58.142
- No, no.
Sometimes I sleep

27:58.277 --> 28:01.311
Sitting up for my back.
- Well, in that case.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.914
Should we move to the bed

28:03.916 --> 28:07.317
Or should we stay in the chair?
- I very much like this boa,

28:07.319 --> 28:10.587
But I think you need
to go to bed to sleep.

28:10.656 --> 28:12.989
How much have you had to drink?
(laughing)

28:13.025 --> 28:15.125

Cheese... G's and t's.

28:16.995 --> 28:19.196

chee... G&ts.

28:19.331 --> 28:20.663
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't think I ate

28:20.700 --> 28:22.466
Enough today.
- C'mon,

28:22.468 --> 28:24.201
Let's get you
something to eat.

28:25.438 --> 28:26.803
Okay.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.674
Looks like they have burgers
and grilled cheese.

28:30.743 --> 28:32.609
Oh, looks like they have
pou...

29:00.106 --> 29:01.305

29:01.440 --> 29:03.373
- Reese took me and hayley
to a drag bar.

29:03.509 --> 29:06.176
And the queen loved
our flight suits

29:06.245 --> 29:09.213
And pulled us on stage
and made us do body shots.

<i> in front of a crowd,</i>

29:11.450 --> 29:13.416

The drag king, reese.

29:16.321 --> 29:18.722
- You did shots off of everyone?

29:18.791 --> 29:21.658
- Yeah.
I wish you were there, milosz.

29:22.228 --> 29:23.927

29:23.996 --> 29:25.996
- What did you want
to talk to me about earlier?

29:26.932 --> 29:30.400
- What I wanted
to tell you is...

29:31.604 --> 29:32.803
You're right.

29:32.805 --> 29:35.272
<i> I mean, sometimes it's easier</i>

29:35.274 --> 29:37.808

<i> For me to make decisions for</i>

29:41.079 --> 29:43.680
We should tell
each other everything.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.094
(engine roaring)

31:04.096 --> 31:06.496
- Almost to the top. Finally.

31:06.632 --> 31:07.998
Should've brought bodie.

31:08.133 --> 31:09.165
This will be a difficult
extraction

31:09.235 --> 31:10.233
If the patient can't walk.

31:10.236 --> 31:11.969
- But I'm strong like bull!

31:12.104 --> 31:13.503
(chuckles)
- over here!

31:14.439 --> 31:15.372
He's over here.

31:15.441 --> 31:16.707
It's my brother, sasha.

31:16.709 --> 31:17.975
He went over the handlebars.

31:22.014 --> 31:24.514
- Pulse is good.
Breathing is shallow.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.049
Where does it hurt, sasha?

31:26.184 --> 31:27.617
- I don't have any pain.

31:27.653 --> 31:28.919
I can't feel anything at all.

31:28.921 --> 31:30.186
- It's probably
just shock, right?

31:30.256 --> 31:31.554
- Maybe.

31:31.590 --> 31:34.591
(tense music)

31:38.864 --> 31:40.397
Positive babinski...

31:40.466 --> 31:42.132
- What do you need?
The board, oxygen?

31:42.267 --> 31:43.400
- Um, board.

31:43.469 --> 31:46.069
- Okay.
- Okay, what's your name?

31:46.105 --> 31:47.671
- Graeme.
- You're gonna help me out,
okay, graeme?

31:47.740 --> 31:49.239
- Okay.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.008
- Okay, it's really important
to keep his head still.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.810
Slowly lift off.
There you go, just like that.

31:53.879 --> 31:55.345
We need to keep him stable.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.146
Now replace where my hands
are with your hands.

31:58.350 --> 31:59.816
There you go. Hold it
nice and steady, you got it?

31:59.818 --> 32:01.251
- Yeah.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.720
- He's got a spinal injury.
Likely paralysis at least,

32:03.722 --> 32:05.155
But given his breathing,

32:05.224 --> 32:07.157
I think it might be
an orthopedic decapitation.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.624
- Decapitation?

32:08.661 --> 32:10.727
- Internal decapitation happens
when a person's neck

32:10.796 --> 32:12.495
Snaps so forcefully ,
the ligaments that attach

32:12.564 --> 32:14.597
The skull to their spine
are severed.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.399
- Can a person survive that?

32:16.435 --> 32:18.301
- Even if they do,

32:18.337 --> 32:19.569
If you move their head at all,

32:19.638 --> 32:21.037
You can damage
the lower brain stem

32:21.073 --> 32:22.439
And kill them instantly.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.741
One wrong step,
one big bump, he's...

32:24.777 --> 32:27.110
We gotta get him out with
as little movement as possible.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.446
- Uh... We can't go
back down that hill.

32:29.515 --> 32:30.980
It's way too steep.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.918
- Alright, easy. Slow is smooth
and smooth is fast.

32:35.053 --> 32:36.286
- This trail isn't
the direction we came.

32:36.355 --> 32:38.087
It's flatter but it's longer.

32:38.123 --> 32:40.123
- That's okay. We just
have to keep sasha still.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.993
- Um, stef...
- Oh, yeah,

32:43.062 --> 32:44.527
It gets pretty rocky.

32:44.563 --> 32:45.929
- That's fine.
We'll just have to go slow.

32:45.998 --> 32:47.798
Okay...

32:47.933 --> 32:50.266
Alright, easy...
Nice and slow, alright?

32:53.005 --> 32:54.737
Easy, easy.
Watch his head.

32:57.476 --> 32:58.875
(groans)

32:58.877 --> 33:00.143
You okay there, sasha?
- Yeah...

33:00.212 --> 33:02.679
- Okay, let's keep going.

33:06.552 --> 33:09.752
- Oh, boy.
Is that another hill?

33:09.788 --> 33:11.888
- Oh. I forgot about this.

33:11.957 --> 33:14.024
Sasha and I had to get off
our bikes and walk up.

33:14.026 --> 33:15.792
- Oh, we can't take
the litter down that.

33:15.861 --> 33:16.993
No way.

33:17.128 --> 33:18.662
- We can't go back.

33:20.232 --> 33:21.831
- What if we take him
out of the litter

33:21.867 --> 33:22.899
And carry him down
on the backboard?

33:23.035 --> 33:24.501
We'll have more control
doing that

33:24.503 --> 33:26.436
Than trying to get him
down that big hill back there.

33:30.709 --> 33:33.410
- Okay. Alright, we go slow.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.445
Okay, straps off.
- Yeah.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.513
- Here we go.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.482
Lex, lex! Wait, whoa.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.017
Whoever goes first
has to walk down backwards

33:41.152 --> 33:42.852
With all of his weight, okay?
It's too dangerous.

33:42.921 --> 33:45.154
If you slip, you'll land
with this whole thing
on top of you.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.623
- So I won't slip.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.658
You're the only one who can take
care of the patient, stef.

33:48.794 --> 33:50.927
If anyone's going to get hurt,
can't be you.

33:50.963 --> 33:53.329
- Well, it can't be
you either, lex.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.531
Lex...

33:55.834 --> 33:57.634
- Ready.
- Graeme, can you help
her out?

33:57.769 --> 33:59.235
- Yeah.
- Yup.

33:59.237 --> 34:00.504
Okay, got it graeme?

34:00.506 --> 34:02.338
- Yeah.
- One, two, three...

34:02.374 --> 34:03.740
(tense music)

34:03.742 --> 34:04.775
- Yup. Got it.

34:04.910 --> 34:06.343
- Going down, nice and slow.

34:06.345 --> 34:07.511
Alright.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.212
We're gonna tilt you
sideways, okay, sasha?

34:09.281 --> 34:11.014
- Okay.
(grunting)

34:11.016 --> 34:12.315
Let it tilt
- okay.

34:15.020 --> 34:16.453
(straining)
slow...

34:16.522 --> 34:18.221
- We got you!
- Okay, get him upright!

34:18.223 --> 34:19.656
- Yeah.

34:21.794 --> 34:22.859
- Alright.

34:22.994 --> 34:24.895
How you doing, sasha?
You okay?

34:24.897 --> 34:26.563
- Great.

34:26.565 --> 34:27.897
Still doing tricks.

34:27.966 --> 34:29.899
(chuckles)

34:29.935 --> 34:31.434
- Let's set him down
a minute, eh?

34:31.437 --> 34:32.902
- Okay.

34:32.938 --> 34:35.105
- It's only a couple more
kilometres to the trailhead.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.506
- I'll go get the litter.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.374
- Hey, whoa. Forget it.
It's too steep.

34:38.376 --> 34:39.775
- It's much lighter
without the patient.

34:39.812 --> 34:41.578
- Lex, leave it.
It's too dangerous.

34:41.580 --> 34:44.047
Okay? Look, we'll come back
after we get sasha in the van.

34:44.182 --> 34:46.216
Yeah?
- Hey, we can't get sasha

34:46.351 --> 34:47.517
To the van without the litter.

34:47.652 --> 34:48.885
It'll take too long
and there's no way

34:49.020 --> 34:50.987
We can cover this terrain
smoothly enough.

34:51.123 --> 34:53.590
One wrong move, one bad bump,
remember?

34:53.592 --> 34:54.857
- One bad bump could what?

34:56.462 --> 34:57.327
- Hey...

34:58.764 --> 34:59.996
- It's his life, stef.

34:59.998 --> 35:02.332
We gotta do everything
we can to help him.

35:02.401 --> 35:03.866
- Commit to the trick...

35:06.204 --> 35:08.738
- I'll get the litter.
- No...

35:08.740 --> 35:10.139
- I'll get it.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.142
(grunts)

35:12.144 --> 35:13.743
- Sasha!
- Hey!

35:13.745 --> 35:15.612
- No!
(grunting)

35:19.151 --> 35:20.417
- Sasha! Graeme.

35:20.552 --> 35:21.885
- Is he okay?
- Yeah!

35:22.020 --> 35:23.753
- I'm pretty sure
you broke that wrist, though.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.588
- I can still help carry him.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.423
He's my brother,
I can push through.

35:27.459 --> 35:28.725
- No, he can't.

35:31.396 --> 35:33.096
(ominous music)

35:34.500 --> 35:36.399
There's no way that can hold
all of our weight at once.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.401
- The trailhead
is just past this bridge

35:38.403 --> 35:40.803
And it's flat the whole way.

35:40.873 --> 35:43.873
- What if the bridge didn't
have to support all of us?

35:43.876 --> 35:44.975
The water doesn't
look that deep.

35:45.110 --> 35:46.876
We can walk in the water
on either side.

35:46.879 --> 35:48.845
- No way. Look,
we have a spinal injury

35:48.914 --> 35:50.513
And a broken wrist.
We can't run the risk

35:50.516 --> 35:52.182
Of anyone else getting hurt.
- What other choice

35:52.184 --> 35:53.583
Do we have, stef?

35:53.718 --> 35:55.252
You're the one always
telling me to take more risks.

35:55.254 --> 35:57.954
- Not when you can get hurt,
lexi!

35:57.990 --> 35:59.456
- Is this about me?

36:00.826 --> 36:02.992
Is this about what happened
at prospect river?

36:04.396 --> 36:06.062
Is it why you switched
my shift so you could

36:06.064 --> 36:07.864
Keep an eye on me?

36:07.999 --> 36:09.498
- It's not like that, lex...
- No.

36:10.602 --> 36:11.668
We're crossing, go ahead.
- Careful, careful.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.903
(tense music)

36:15.874 --> 36:17.807
- Okay. Here we go.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.008
Easy.
- Got it?

36:21.313 --> 36:23.413
Okay? Steady.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.582
You okay?
- I'm good.

36:29.922 --> 36:31.321
- Lex...
- I told you I'm--

36:31.323 --> 36:33.423
(lexi screaming)
- lexi! Lex!

36:33.959 --> 36:35.291
Lex! Lex!

36:37.095 --> 36:38.261
Lexi!

36:43.935 --> 36:44.901
Lex.

36:47.306 --> 36:48.305
- I'm okay!

36:48.440 --> 36:50.173
I'm okay.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.777
I just, I lost my footing.

36:55.447 --> 36:56.446
I'm okay.

36:59.151 --> 37:00.817
- It's getting deeper.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.652
(tense music)

37:06.592 --> 37:08.525
- Whoa, whoa, you guys okay?

37:08.660 --> 37:09.926
- Grab the back.

37:11.697 --> 37:14.797
- I'm paralyzed, aren't I?
That's what no one's saying.

37:15.567 --> 37:19.068
- Hey, same rules as before.

37:19.137 --> 37:20.737
Commit to the trick.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.872
Be afraid, but do it anyway.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.207
I'll be with you
the whole way.

37:24.342 --> 37:26.275
Got it?
- Alright, we're going to lift.

37:27.345 --> 37:29.479
(gentle music)

37:29.481 --> 37:31.414
(birds chirping)

37:34.486 --> 37:36.753
(tense music)

37:36.888 --> 37:39.022
It's missing.
My necklace is gone.

37:39.024 --> 37:41.758
Uh... Must have
fallen off in the river.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.993
I need my necklace.
- Stef!

37:44.963 --> 37:47.163
(breathing heavily)

37:47.199 --> 37:49.899
Stef, it's gone!
There's a current!

37:49.935 --> 37:52.402
- No, no, it's not! It's here,
I just have to find it!

37:52.471 --> 37:54.136
- Can you stop it?
It's not safe!

37:56.975 --> 37:58.774
Stef, let it go!

37:58.810 --> 38:01.111
- It's here...
- It's gone!

38:01.113 --> 38:04.114
(sobbing)

38:04.116 --> 38:05.748
- No!

38:08.720 --> 38:11.154
(soft emotional music)

38:17.663 --> 38:19.729
Uh, before thompson,

38:19.765 --> 38:22.732
I worked ems in toronto.

38:25.304 --> 38:30.206
Uh, one night,
we got a call to an mva.

38:31.343 --> 38:33.976
There was a woman
on her back in the street.

38:35.213 --> 38:38.148
She was thrown from a car.

38:39.751 --> 38:41.684
When I got to her...

38:41.753 --> 38:43.353
I, uh...

38:44.622 --> 38:46.622
Realized it was mel.

38:47.893 --> 38:50.426
It's my high school girlfriend.

38:51.563 --> 38:52.928
So...

38:54.099 --> 38:56.833
She was awake,

38:56.902 --> 38:58.568
She recognized me.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.770
But when I did
the cranial assessment,

39:00.839 --> 39:02.172
The back of her skull...

39:06.044 --> 39:08.511
There was nothing I could do.

39:08.646 --> 39:09.945
I still think...
(sobs)

39:11.016 --> 39:13.182
There was nothing,
I couldn't do anything.

39:13.251 --> 39:15.317
There was...
- Hey.

39:15.354 --> 39:16.653
(sobbing)

39:20.792 --> 39:23.659
That's why I moved
to thompson.

39:23.661 --> 39:25.528
That's why I came here.
Because I...

39:26.931 --> 39:29.799
Where I don't know anybody,
where there's no risk

39:29.835 --> 39:31.134
Of showing up at a call

39:31.269 --> 39:33.369
And finding someone
I care about.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.076
Look, lex, I...

39:43.915 --> 39:47.150
Knowing something
could have happened to you...

39:47.219 --> 39:49.285
I can't...

39:49.421 --> 39:51.620
Handle showing up
to another call

39:51.656 --> 39:52.955
To find someone I love hurt.

39:52.991 --> 39:54.657
I just, I can't.

39:55.994 --> 39:57.092
- Love?

40:05.303 --> 40:07.703
(soft music)

40:24.423 --> 40:27.122
- Fergus was impressed.
He just emailed.

40:27.159 --> 40:29.725
He's already read
your paper and crystal,

40:29.761 --> 40:32.262
He wants to help you
get published.

40:32.397 --> 40:34.263
- I thought he was going
to endorse his fellow.

40:34.332 --> 40:35.731
- But you changed his mind.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.435
This is what all
the hard work is for.

40:38.570 --> 40:42.005
All the struggle,
everything that we've sacrificed

40:42.140 --> 40:43.940
Is for moments like this.

40:44.075 --> 40:45.875
So take a breath.

40:45.877 --> 40:47.610
Enjoy it!

40:49.247 --> 40:51.180
(gentle music)

40:52.751 --> 40:54.551
(laughing)

40:54.686 --> 40:56.486
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.754
- Okay, so where
are you taking me?

40:58.824 --> 41:00.623
- Well, I got a couple
places in mind.

41:00.692 --> 41:02.492
See a movie or something...

41:02.494 --> 41:04.427
(chuckling)
- okay, sounds good.

41:04.429 --> 41:06.429
Okay, as long as it
doesn't involve...

41:06.564 --> 41:07.830
(voices fade)

41:09.868 --> 41:11.100
- I know I screwed up.

41:11.169 --> 41:13.169
I'll find another
part-time job.

41:13.171 --> 41:15.104
- We can't keep doing this,
bodie.

41:15.173 --> 41:17.073
At this rate,
we're going to need third jobs

41:17.142 --> 41:20.043
Just to pay for childcare
so that we can work.

41:20.045 --> 41:21.444
(sighs)

41:21.579 --> 41:22.912
I'm going to drop
out of school.

41:24.182 --> 41:25.948
I mean, we're exhausted.

41:26.017 --> 41:27.716
Joel can't get on
a proper routine.

41:27.752 --> 41:29.219
- Yeah, but once
your program ends...

41:29.354 --> 41:31.354
- We'll still be doing
shift work

41:31.356 --> 41:33.722
With crazy hours and overnights.

41:34.626 --> 41:36.593
Okay, look,
my mom's neighbor

41:36.728 --> 41:38.394
Is an accountant.

41:38.396 --> 41:39.762
She's offered to train me.

41:40.699 --> 41:42.131
It's nine to five.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.167
And she said I could
bring joel.

41:45.403 --> 41:47.136
People always need
accountants.

41:47.939 --> 41:49.338
And you know, regular hours

41:49.407 --> 41:50.940
Would really take
the pressure off of us.

41:51.075 --> 41:52.808
(sighs)

41:54.078 --> 41:57.513
- Look, I don't want you
to give up your dream, mads.

41:58.950 --> 42:02.151
- Leaving thompson with you,

42:02.220 --> 42:03.919
That was my dream.

42:07.158 --> 42:08.958
I wouldn't change it, though.

42:10.161 --> 42:11.527
Except maybe to get more sleep.

42:13.965 --> 42:15.899
- Mads...
- I'm going to go to the college

42:16.034 --> 42:18.368
Today and do the paperwork.

42:18.503 --> 42:19.635
Okay?

42:19.704 --> 42:21.103
- Yeah...

42:28.446 --> 42:30.546
(door opens)
- ah, you shouldn't have!

42:30.549 --> 42:31.948
Three sugars?

42:32.083 --> 42:33.716
Hope you got a hazelnut
for hayley because the kids

42:33.851 --> 42:35.652
Had a big night out last night.

42:35.654 --> 42:37.387
- Hey, speak for yourself.
I feel great!

42:37.522 --> 42:39.121
I finally got some sleep
last night

42:39.157 --> 42:42.325
For the first time in ages!
Thank you!

42:44.930 --> 42:47.564
- Skippy.
- Thanks, nowie.

42:48.700 --> 42:51.700
- Doing the lord's work,
best boyfriend ever.

42:52.604 --> 42:54.203
Missed you, boo.

42:58.376 --> 42:59.908
- I missed you, too.

43:01.112 --> 43:02.812
- It's my favourite, c'mon.

43:02.814 --> 43:04.814
(emotional music)

43:04.883 --> 43:07.216
(sighs)

43:15.026 --> 43:17.960
(tense music)

43:18.029 --> 43:20.729
Subtitling: Difuze

43:31.643 --> 43:34.110
(♪♪)
