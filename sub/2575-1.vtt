01:12.440 --> 01:14.249
There he is again.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.002
Almost two decades
and he still comes.

01:19.600 --> 01:20.806
So sad.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.970
How you doing, buddy?

01:25.600 --> 01:28.171
Brought you all
your favorite candies.

01:33.480 --> 01:36.086
Come on, Lloyd,
you gotta get over her!

01:36.280 --> 01:38.089
Mary Samsonite
was just a girl.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.850
Besides, she's married.

01:42.320 --> 01:43.685
And even if
it had worked out,

01:43.760 --> 01:46.161
would you really want
ginger babies? Ugh.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.681
Gross.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.690
Man, you gotta
give me something!

02:04.640 --> 02:07.484
Lloyd, I got something
important to tell you.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.568
I can't come here anymore.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.246
I got kind of a serious
medical problem.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.563
It's sort of complicated.

02:22.520 --> 02:26.241
Basically, I'm gonna be pretty
busy for the next few months.

02:28.640 --> 02:29.721
Anyway...

02:30.240 --> 02:32.686
You're in good
hands here. So...

02:37.200 --> 02:38.770
Take care, buddy.

02:43.520 --> 02:44.885
Lloyd, did you
say something?

02:45.680 --> 02:47.011
<i>I</i> got you.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.650
That's it, kid.
You can do it.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.449
Come on, come on, come on!
Spit it out!

02:55.720 --> 02:57.290
Got ya!

02:59.960 --> 03:01.724
What?

03:02.240 --> 03:04.686
You should see the
look on your face!

03:05.000 --> 03:07.810
I got you so good!

03:07.920 --> 03:10.082
Wait a second!

03:10.200 --> 03:13.761
Are you telling me that you
were faking for 20 years?

03:14.120 --> 03:15.121
Uh-huh.

03:15.200 --> 03:18.921
So you mean that you just wasted
the best years of your life?

03:19.400 --> 03:20.731
Out the window!

03:20.800 --> 03:25.044
And you let me come here every
Wednesday for, like, a thousand weeks,

03:25.440 --> 03:27.283
and it was all
just for a gag?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.206
Uh-huh.

03:29.440 --> 03:30.601
That's

03:31.120 --> 03:32.485
awesome!

03:32.600 --> 03:33.761
I know!

03:33.840 --> 03:36.969
You gotta admit, I totally
had you suckered, didn't I?

03:37.200 --> 03:38.486
Hook, line and sphincter!

03:39.800 --> 03:42.121
Oh, oh.
On! Oh, oh. Oh.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.811
Legs are a little rubbery after
all that time sitting here.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.086
Why don't you
roll me inside?

03:47.160 --> 03:49.481
We'll get the nurse to take
the catheter out of me.
Oh.

03:49.640 --> 03:52.086
I wanna see if my lizard's
still spitting straight.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.640
We don't need nurses for that.
I know how to do it.

03:54.800 --> 03:55.926
But don't you have to...

03:59.000 --> 04:00.081
Oh, God!

04:00.320 --> 04:01.810
That thing's
really taken root!

04:02.280 --> 04:03.770
Hey, fellas!

04:03.840 --> 04:05.171
Give me a hand over here.
Si.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.683
Yankos los pee-pee.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.331
<i>Are you sure
about this, Har?</i>

04:11.680 --> 04:13.603
Usually, doctors like
to do this sort of thing.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.523
Oh, that's just for
insurance purposes.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.762
On three. Three!

04:26.600 --> 04:28.841
You are a fricking
genius, Lloyd!

04:28.920 --> 04:30.760
I mean, nobody else
could have pulled that off!

04:30.800 --> 04:31.800
Eh!
Nobody!

04:31.840 --> 04:35.367
I mean,
the shock treatments,
the partial lobotomy!

04:35.680 --> 04:37.364
That's commitment!
Yeah.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.845
It broke up the monotony.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.081
One thing
I don't get, though.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.322
Why did you play it out
for 20 whole years?

04:43.720 --> 04:45.960
Because it wouldn't
have been funny if
I stopped too soon.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.685
Comedy is all
about timing, Har.

04:47.840 --> 04:51.322
Yeah, but wouldn't it still have been
funny if you quit after 10 years?

04:51.400 --> 04:53.528
Oh, definitely.
But not as!

04:53.600 --> 04:55.250
Whoa!

04:55.840 --> 04:57.046
Pretty bird.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.889
Crap on toast!
Pretty bird.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.443
Is that grown-up Billy in 4-C?
Uh-huh.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.809
Come on, Siskel,
give me a movie quote.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.689
What did they say
in Jerry Maguire?

05:05.840 --> 05:07.365
"You had me at hello."

05:07.440 --> 05:08.601
<i>Um, Titanic?</i>

05:08.720 --> 05:10.165
"I'm king of the world."

05:10.240 --> 05:11.730
Good job!

05:12.360 --> 05:13.407
We better
tiptoe past him.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.363
Oh, no, you can't
tiptoe past a blindy.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.441
Their hearing's too good.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.246
What?
Mmm-hmm.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.084
That's just an
old wives' tale.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.362
Like women shouldn't
smoke during pregnancy.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.450
I turned out fine. My mom
smoked like a chimney.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.480
Especially when she was drinking!

05:27.560 --> 05:28.560
Whatever.
Doesn't matter.

05:28.640 --> 05:30.000
Billy's over
the whole Petey thing.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.241
You should see
his apartment.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.931
He's got the best rare
bird collection in Rhody!

05:35.280 --> 05:36.770
I gotta see this.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.450
Hey, Billy!

05:40.240 --> 05:42.811
I hear you got a lot
of flocking birds.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.282
Is that you, Lloyd?

05:49.280 --> 05:50.611
Very good.

05:50.760 --> 05:53.411
I didn't think you'd recognize
me after all these years.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.130
So what have you
been up to, buddy boy?

05:55.280 --> 05:56.611
Seen any good
movies lately?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.002
I mean, you know,
like...

06:00.160 --> 06:01.400
On the radio?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.411
What was that?

06:04.600 --> 06:05.880
Did you just feed
them something?

06:05.920 --> 06:06.920
Relax.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.007
It's just a little candy.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.725
You can't feed
candy to birds!

06:09.800 --> 06:10.961
Their stomachs
will explode!

06:11.240 --> 06:12.810
Even if it's just
a few Pop Rocks?

06:12.920 --> 06:15.127
Are you crazy?
Pick those up!

06:15.240 --> 06:17.129
Pick them up!
All right, all right!

06:17.400 --> 06:18.845
Sheesh.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.365
Well, nice catching up.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.001
See you later.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.720
Not if I see you first!

06:25.800 --> 06:27.325
Ha-ha! Good one!

06:27.440 --> 06:29.488
No, no, no,
it's okay, Siskel.

06:30.680 --> 06:33.604
Daddy's not gonna let him
get anywhere near you.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.688
Booga!

06:36.120 --> 06:38.088
See? I told you
that hearing thing

06:38.160 --> 06:39.280
was a wives' tale.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.008
Oh, yeah!

06:43.520 --> 06:45.443
Hey, who's this?
Ah.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.440
That's Butthole.

06:47.480 --> 06:48.925
I found him out in the
alley a couple years ago.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.684
Why did you name him Butthole?
Oh.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.691
Because of this.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.205
Oh, yeah. Good name.

06:55.680 --> 06:56.681
Totally fits.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.489
I like what you've
done with the place.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.804
Nice cappuccino machine.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.041
Who's the astronaut?

07:03.160 --> 07:04.366
Oh, that's my roommate.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.040
Roommate?

07:06.480 --> 07:07.720
You got a new roommate?

07:07.840 --> 07:10.127
I had to get somebody to
pay your half of the rent

07:10.240 --> 07:11.480
while you were
in the hospital.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.691
How's it going,
Ice Pick?

07:13.880 --> 07:16.565
Best day ever. Greatest
day of my life, really.

07:18.360 --> 07:19.850
Pick cooks up
a rock candy

07:19.960 --> 07:21.121
that will
make you dizzy.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.089
Folks come from all over
the city to buy it.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.005
It's burning my eyes.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.845
Must be Cajun style.

07:28.520 --> 07:31.330
So what's this serious
medical problem you've
been blabbing about?

07:31.840 --> 07:33.080
And it better be good.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.571
Lloyd,
there's something...

07:37.720 --> 07:38.687
I've known about
this for a while,

07:38.760 --> 07:39.880
but I didn't
wanna worry you.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.324
Mmm-hmm?

07:42.880 --> 07:44.689
I need a kidney transplant.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.207
No way! Really?

07:48.680 --> 07:49.727
Wow.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.166
So what do you wanna
do for dinner tonight?

07:51.440 --> 07:52.726
Wanna hit Haven Brothers?

07:53.040 --> 07:55.321
I could eat the mud-hole out
of a dead skunk!

07:55.920 --> 07:57.365
Are you not listening
to me, Lloyd?

07:57.600 --> 07:59.568
Getting a new kidney
is a really big deal.

07:59.920 --> 08:03.242
There's waiting lists,
lots and lots of
forms to fill out,

08:03.440 --> 08:06.569
and if I can't find another
kidney real soon, I'm dead meat.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.607
Yeah, well,

08:10.280 --> 08:12.806
maybe, just maybe,

08:12.960 --> 08:16.362
there's a person out there
who cares about you so much

08:16.520 --> 08:17.965
that said person
would be willing

08:18.040 --> 08:20.805
to give up a little piece of
himself to save your life.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.442
Really, Lloyd?
You'd do that?

08:23.760 --> 08:27.446
Me?
Yeah, right! Nice try!

08:27.600 --> 08:29.250
The nerve!
Oh.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.249
I mean, I would,
in a New York heartbeat.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.085
I'm just not a urine match.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.248
My wizz doesn't get
all sudsy like yours.

08:39.159 --> 08:40.446
Ow.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.568
Wait. Don't panic.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.642
I know exactly
what we gotta do.

08:49.560 --> 08:50.527
I don't know
about this, Lloyd.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.170
I haven't been home
in over 20 years.

08:52.320 --> 08:53.731
Come on, Harry!

08:53.800 --> 08:55.609
You need a genital
organ match.

08:55.720 --> 08:56.926
They're your parents.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.650
I'm not gonna go crawling
back to them, Lloyd.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.085
Not after what
they did to me.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.241
What did they do?

09:01.400 --> 09:02.845
They threw me
out of the house.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.241
Why? Just because I
told them I was gay.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.126
Why did you
tell them that?

09:07.520 --> 09:08.601
I was sick of
mowing the lawn.

09:08.680 --> 09:09.761
Oh, yeah.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.047
Well, I don't see
what choice you have.

09:12.440 --> 09:13.680
You either go home
and face the music

09:13.760 --> 09:15.808
or you suffocate
in your own pee.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.645
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

09:17.720 --> 09:18.767
Okay, let's do this.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.330
All right. Hop on.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.084
Engage super thrusters!

09:24.160 --> 09:25.400
Don't, Lloyd!

09:27.600 --> 09:29.045
Pardon me, Harry.

09:41.480 --> 09:42.845
Here we are.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.810
Place looks smaller
than I remember.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.047
Oh, yeah.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.161
Wow.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.527
Lot of memories
on this street.

09:50.640 --> 09:51.846
Yeah.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.646
Remember when we
pulled up on the bike

09:53.720 --> 09:55.245
and parked it
a couple seconds ago?

09:55.360 --> 09:56.407
Yeah, that was cool.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.403
Oh, those were the days.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.040
I remember
one afternoon,

10:00.160 --> 10:01.525
it was the first
day of spring,

10:01.680 --> 10:03.762
the flowers were blooming,
the sun was shining

10:03.840 --> 10:05.444
and you and I
were doing cartwheels

10:05.520 --> 10:06.806
right down that
hill over there.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.245
Yeah, I remember that!

10:08.360 --> 10:10.328
We were in your dad's
Lincoln, right? Yeah.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.521
You totally lost it
when I yanked the wheel.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.569
Come on! Pick it up!

10:26.640 --> 10:29.041
Show a little
hustle in there!

10:33.760 --> 10:36.286
Wow. Rong time, Harry!

10:36.880 --> 10:38.530
Oh, sorry.
We'll come back later.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.728
Hey!
No, no, no! I mean,

10:40.880 --> 10:42.848
<i>rong time, no see.</i>

10:43.440 --> 10:44.726
Oh.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.724
Where you been?

10:46.880 --> 10:48.120
Come! Come in!

10:48.280 --> 10:50.089
Oh!
Thanks, Dad.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.447
So you see,

10:54.560 --> 10:58.042
my best hope for a donor match
is with a blood relative.

10:58.120 --> 10:59.246
Family.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.922
Harry, you not touch
your peanut butter.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.561
Oh, that's okay.
I'm not very
hungry, Dad.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.244
When Harry young,

11:08.360 --> 11:11.045
oh, boy, he loves
the peanut butter.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.241
Oh.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.290
Three jar a week disappear!

11:14.440 --> 11:15.487
Good to know.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.809
So anyway, which one of you
two's gonna cough up a kidney?

11:23.040 --> 11:25.281
What? What was that?

11:26.160 --> 11:27.207
Wait!

11:27.280 --> 11:29.169
I know! You're the gopher
from Caddyshack.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.602
Look at her!
She's got it down!

11:31.960 --> 11:33.405
We love you, Harry.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.163
Do you love
him long time?

11:37.960 --> 11:40.850
But you know you're
not our real son, right?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.411
You adopted.

11:43.840 --> 11:44.966
Ouch.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.970
Dad, what are you saying?

11:53.800 --> 11:55.290
Sorry, Harry.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.970
We thought you know.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.527
Wow.

11:59.640 --> 12:01.085
What a nut punch.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.651
Don't be glum, Har.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.451
All this means is that your real
parents are out there somewhere.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.125
And I will go to
the ends of the earth to...

12:07.200 --> 12:08.326
Real parents dead.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.641
You're boned.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.049
James boned.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.450
Harry, Harry.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.564
No idea what you're saying,
Ma, but right back at you.

12:29.720 --> 12:33.441
Harry, before you go, your
mail piling up for many year.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.522
Oh.
We saving for you.

12:38.240 --> 12:41.642
Huh. Junk mail,
junk mail.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.368
I got accepted
to Arizona State.

12:45.480 --> 12:46.480
Hmm?

12:46.520 --> 12:47.885
Oh, look at this.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.364
It's a postcard
from Fraida Felcher.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.045
The chick from Cranston?

12:52.240 --> 12:53.890
Ooh!

12:55.200 --> 12:56.690
So, what'd she
have to say?

12:57.480 --> 12:59.562
"Harry, I'm pregnant.
Please call me."

13:00.200 --> 13:02.168
Lloyd,
I'm gonna be a dad!

13:02.920 --> 13:04.001
No way!

13:07.160 --> 13:08.366
Look at the postmark.

13:08.440 --> 13:09.726
1991.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.570
Do you know what
this means, Harry?

13:11.760 --> 13:13.762
You have a grown kid.
Oh.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.730
With grown kidneys.

13:20.920 --> 13:23.446
But, Lloyd, we don't have
a phone number or address,

13:23.560 --> 13:25.722
or nothing.
And who we fooling?

13:25.920 --> 13:28.366
Even if I find him,
my kid's never met me.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.443
Why would he wanna
give me a kidney?

13:30.880 --> 13:32.609
Are you serious?

13:32.880 --> 13:34.530
After all you've
done for him?

13:34.760 --> 13:36.364
It's the least he can do.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.131
What have I ever
done for him?

13:39.600 --> 13:41.967
You gave him his space.
Kids love that.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.767
I didn't wanna be
a helicopter parent.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.565
And you filled him
with wonder.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.405
Wonder?
Yeah.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.089
Like, "I wonder who
my deadbeat dad is?"

13:54.360 --> 13:55.771
Oh, it's okay, Lloyd.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.604
I've had a full life.

13:59.640 --> 14:01.483
I was a paperboy
for a week.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.329
I fathered a child.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.922
I've seen every episode
of Full House.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.406
Wow!

14:07.480 --> 14:08.811
Every episode?

14:09.600 --> 14:10.886
Okay, Okay-

14:11.040 --> 14:12.246
So how are
we gonna do this?

14:13.640 --> 14:15.210
If we find Fraida,
we find your kid.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.880
If we find your kid,
we find your kidney.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.286
Simple.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.568
Yeah, but I never even
knew where Fraida lived.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.610
I didn't have a car.
She always had to
pick me up in her van.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.969
Didn't you meet her
through Pete Stainer?

14:27.280 --> 14:28.964
Who?
Pee-Stain!

14:29.320 --> 14:30.651
He'll know how
to reach her.

14:30.760 --> 14:33.809
Yeah, but I haven't talked to
Pee-Stain in a hundred years!

14:33.920 --> 14:35.960
I can't drop by his house
in the middle of the night

14:36.000 --> 14:37.923
and ask him for
some chick's number.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.527
Sure you can!

14:41.120 --> 14:44.169
Oh, okay. But we gotta
be sub-tull about it.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.968
The word is pronounced
"subtle," Harry.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.087
It's a silent "B."

14:52.800 --> 14:53.847
What was that for?

14:54.160 --> 14:55.810
You had a gah-nat on you.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.811
Maybe we should catch a bus
to Pee-Stain's house.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.400
We can't. We got the bike.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.211
Oh, that's okay.
They got bike racks on
the front of buses now.

15:04.680 --> 15:05.841
Cool.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.207
Perfect.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.765
That's very convenient.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.240
Hey, guys!

15:18.560 --> 15:20.005
You forgot your bike!

15:20.200 --> 15:23.329
Oh, it's not ours. Somebody
abandoned it in front of our place.

15:23.560 --> 15:27.167
Yeah. Just left it there
double-chained to a tree.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.081
Hey, Har.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.123
You wanna hear the second most
annoying sound in the world?

15:34.200 --> 15:35.281
Sure.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.485
Yeah, that's
pretty annoying.

15:44.560 --> 15:45.766
No, not that.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.006
What the
hell are you doing

15:47.080 --> 15:49.208
ringing our doorbell like that
in the middle of the night?

15:49.360 --> 15:50.407
That!

15:52.200 --> 15:54.931
Mr. Stainer. Mrs. Stainer.
Nice to see you.

15:55.440 --> 15:56.885
Harry, Lloyd.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.765
To what do we owe the honor
at this late hour, gentlemen?

16:00.480 --> 16:01.891
We were just wondering
if Pee-Stain

16:01.960 --> 16:03.371
wanted to come out
for some suds.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.291
And maybe have
his ass handed to him

16:05.400 --> 16:06.640
in a couple of games
of Dig Dug.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.565
Lloyd.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.886
Peter is dead.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.881
Yeah, right. Since when?

16:16.560 --> 16:19.404
Since 1991. Remember?

16:20.280 --> 16:21.327
The motorcycle accident?

16:22.640 --> 16:24.722
But I thought
he pulled through.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.849
The obituary said he was
survived by his parents.

16:28.640 --> 16:31.450
Uh, no. He did
not pull through.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.606
Are you sure?

16:34.600 --> 16:35.761
Yes.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.447
Oh, yeah.

16:41.240 --> 16:42.924
You guys are right.

16:43.320 --> 16:46.005
Anyway. Sorry about
that whole thing.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.282
Pee-Stain and I were
very close friends.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.560
Yeah, we know.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.162
You're the one who
sold him the motorcycle.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.441
And if I recall,

16:53.640 --> 16:55.005
I made him a sweet deal.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.287
My bike for his
helmet, straight up.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.329
That thing was a rocket.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.040
A little squirrelly
on the corners,

17:01.120 --> 17:02.451
but when you got it
on a straightaway...

17:02.480 --> 17:04.960
Good night, Lloyd.
Good night, Harry.

17:09.960 --> 17:10.961
That was awkward.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.326
You're not kidding.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.041
When somebody comes
to your door at 3:00 a.m..

17:15.200 --> 17:16.804
put some pants on!

17:17.280 --> 17:18.486
Hey, wait a second.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.284
That's where
I met Fraida Felcher.

17:20.440 --> 17:24.330
She worked at
the funeral parlor where
they buried Pee-Stain.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.327
Wow.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.850
Think about it.

17:29.280 --> 17:32.204
If I hadn't sold that
crotch rocket to Pee-Stain,

17:32.400 --> 17:33.765
you wouldn't have
a bastard child

17:33.840 --> 17:35.649
who's gonna save your life.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.640
God's got a pretty warped
sense of humor, huh?

17:39.800 --> 17:42.326
Yeah. I bet
he smokes weed.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.451
Otherwise, why would he put our
testicles outside our bodies

17:45.520 --> 17:46.681
where someone
could do this?

18:03.040 --> 18:04.690
Ow!

18:05.040 --> 18:06.166
Bush club!

18:07.760 --> 18:09.444
What are
you doing, Lloyd?

18:10.440 --> 18:12.090
I'm about to meet my kid!

18:12.240 --> 18:13.321
Sorry, Har.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.562
Bushes like that don't
come along every day.

18:21.360 --> 18:24.204
Excuse me, sir.
ls Fraida working today?

18:27.040 --> 18:28.201
- I'm Fraida.
- Oh.

18:28.520 --> 18:29.681
Sorry for the confusion.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.967
We meant your smoking-hot
daughter, Fraida Junior.

18:32.960 --> 18:35.042
There is no
Fraida Junior.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.489
I'm the only Fraida
in the family.

18:37.560 --> 18:40.723
That little hottie
must have given us a fake name.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.725
Look, guys, it's me,

18:42.920 --> 18:43.967
Fraida Felcher.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.081
Yeah, right.

18:45.200 --> 18:48.807
Like we'd be fighting over those
blowfish jowls.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.121
No offense.

18:50.560 --> 18:51.607
Harry.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.247
Lloyd.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.405
I'm gonna say
this one more time.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.050
I'm Fraida.

19:00.760 --> 19:01.807
Tattoo.

19:01.880 --> 19:02.881
<i>Oh, Yeah?</i>

19:02.960 --> 19:04.405
Then show us your tattoo.
Mmm-hmm.

19:04.720 --> 19:07.326
Because Fraida had a cute
little smiley face on her back

19:07.480 --> 19:09.289
right above
her bikini line.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.287
Well?

19:26.640 --> 19:27.641
Hmm.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.400
It's close.
Mmm.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.886
Oh. Hi, Fraida.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.485
Oh, hey!
How you been?

19:34.760 --> 19:35.841
Have you been
doing yoga?

19:36.640 --> 19:39.769
Yeah, I'm kind of busy. ls there
a reason you guys are here?

19:40.600 --> 19:41.761
Yes.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.687
I just received this postcard
that you sent me 22 years ago.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.688
Talk about snail mail.

19:52.640 --> 19:53.721
You better come in.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.766
So, did you, uh,
ever have the baby?

20:03.080 --> 20:05.481
I had a daughter. Named her Fanny.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.364
You hear that, Har?
A little girl.

20:07.560 --> 20:09.005
Fanny Felcher!
Ow!

20:09.600 --> 20:11.409
Are you all right?
Uh, bad back.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.080
Oh, I have so many
questions for you.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.207
Like?

20:15.280 --> 20:17.328
For starters,
how was the pregnancy?

20:17.400 --> 20:20.324
Was it a tough one? Did
they have to saw you open?

20:20.480 --> 20:22.562
Whoa, Har.
Dial it down!

20:22.920 --> 20:24.920
We're talking about the
miracle of childbirth here.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.327
What my insensitive
friend meant was,

20:27.400 --> 20:28.765
did you have a C-section

20:28.840 --> 20:32.287
or were you able to have
the baby  au snatch-urel?

20:34.120 --> 20:36.441
It went smoothly.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.770
So, uh, where is she?

20:45.400 --> 20:46.561
Can I meet her?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.730
I gave her up for adoption.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.406
What?

20:54.080 --> 20:56.447
Why? Because I was
broke and scared.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.847
I regretted it
as soon as I did it.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.964
But it was too late.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.328
I'd already signed
away all my rights.

21:04.800 --> 21:05.926
Then a couple years ago

21:06.000 --> 21:07.604
I wrote her a letter.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.330
But she never
wrote me back.

21:11.160 --> 21:12.207
Wait here.

21:13.680 --> 21:15.489
What do we do now?

21:15.960 --> 21:17.928
What do you mean,
"What do we do now?"

21:18.400 --> 21:20.607
I mean, at this exact moment
in time, what do we do?

21:20.800 --> 21:22.290
Harry, don't you hear that?

21:22.360 --> 21:24.089
It's the fat lady singing.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.480
It's over!

21:26.080 --> 21:27.889
I need something to drink.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.730
But...
Harry, enough!

21:30.160 --> 21:31.571
We tried and we failed!

21:31.720 --> 21:33.290
As Vince Lombardi
used to say,

21:33.360 --> 21:34.521
you gotta know
when to quit!

21:35.600 --> 21:38.080
Hey, you should pick out one of
those coffins while we're here.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.571
What if...
Darn it, Har!

21:39.800 --> 21:42.929
I cannot live on this emotional
roller coaster any longer.

21:43.080 --> 21:44.889
I feel bad saying it,
but you're slunk meat.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.080
Here's a picture I found
of my daughter online.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.922
Or, we could suck it up,

22:01.080 --> 22:02.206
pick ourselves up
by our bootstraps

22:02.320 --> 22:04.846
and go find that little girl!

22:06.120 --> 22:07.201
Hold on.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.248
You wrote her a letter. You
must know where she lives!

22:09.320 --> 22:13.211
Yeah. I tracked her down through
this adoption search site.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.767
She was raised by
this hotshot scientist.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.849
Why didn't you just go
find her in person?

22:18.600 --> 22:19.886
If she doesn't
want to meet me,

22:19.960 --> 22:21.883
I am not going to
force myself on her.

22:22.440 --> 22:23.965
Maybe she didn't
get your letter.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.811
She got it, all right.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.600
What if we go
track her down for you?

22:29.680 --> 22:31.250
There's no lawsuit
against that.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.806
Are you guys serious?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.161
You'd help me out?

22:34.640 --> 22:36.529
Of course we'll
help you out.

22:36.600 --> 22:37.601
We're gonna need
some wheels.

22:37.720 --> 22:38.767
I'll lend you a car.

22:38.840 --> 22:39.921
Then it's done.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.731
Yeah, using this address
and our superior instincts,

22:42.920 --> 22:44.524
you and your little girl
are gonna be having

22:44.600 --> 22:46.090
a family reunion
in no time.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.366
Cheers!

22:47.840 --> 22:49.365
Whoa! Wait.
Where did you get that?

22:50.040 --> 22:51.280
The Slurpee machine
in the back.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.925
That's embalming fluid.

22:53.800 --> 22:54.801
Oh.

22:55.360 --> 22:56.725
Does it have aspartame?

22:57.160 --> 22:58.241
No.

22:58.520 --> 22:59.681
Cool.

23:12.080 --> 23:14.082
Hey, guys,
check this out!

23:34.400 --> 23:36.846
What about the blue roads
with the big numbers?

23:37.160 --> 23:38.207
Those are rivers.

23:38.280 --> 23:39.327
They're rivers?
Yeah.

23:39.400 --> 23:40.890
We could get a boat.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.324
Boats are dangerous.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.280
This is it.

24:02.440 --> 24:05.046
6765 Elmwood.

24:13.440 --> 24:14.521
You look nervous.

24:14.640 --> 24:16.290
I am nervous!
I'm about to meet my kid

24:16.360 --> 24:17.600
and I don't know
what to say to her.

24:17.680 --> 24:18.920
That's real easy, Har.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.367
You make a little small talk about
why you missed all those birthdays,

24:21.480 --> 24:23.130
holidays and graduations.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.168
Maybe a couple of dick
jokes to put her at ease.

24:25.480 --> 24:26.720
And boing, you hit
her up for the kidney.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.643
Okay. What if
she says no?

24:28.800 --> 24:29.801
She's not gonna say no.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.325
She's the fruit
of your loom.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.321
Suck me sideways.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.208
You're the spitting
image of your mother.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.004
You morons.

24:45.280 --> 24:47.726
This is the return address.

24:48.200 --> 24:52.046
Hers is on the side
with the stamp.

24:53.480 --> 24:54.481
Oh.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.242
But it's still uncanny!

25:19.720 --> 25:21.210
Oxford, Maryland, huh?

25:21.280 --> 25:24.204
So that's where
my little girl's been
living all these years.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.246
Hey, Har!

25:26.320 --> 25:28.288
Look it.
Giant nutcracker.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.204
Oh.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.680
I want

25:33.880 --> 25:35.962
your nuts,

25:36.120 --> 25:38.407
Harry!

25:41.440 --> 25:45.081
Boy, I sure wish I could
have been there for her
when she was little.

25:45.160 --> 25:46.241
Whatever.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.721
That's all water under
the fridge now, Har.

25:48.880 --> 25:49.881
Think of the bright side.

25:49.960 --> 25:51.280
You're finally
getting to meet her

25:51.440 --> 25:53.647
and you never had to change
all those poopie diapers.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.842
That's called being
a parent, Lloyd.

25:55.960 --> 25:59.089
Besides, I changed your
poopie diapers for 20 years.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.007
I totally sucked you in.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.488
Half the time,
it wasn't even my poop.

26:22.800 --> 26:26.122
I wonder what it would have
been like to raise a child.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.685
Maybe I couldn't afford to send
her to the best public schools,

26:33.080 --> 26:35.731
but I'll bet I would have
been a pretty good dad.

26:42.920 --> 26:45.571
You don't need
training wheels.
You can do this.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.206
Here we go!

26:47.280 --> 26:48.770
Come on, come on!

26:51.560 --> 26:53.483
No way!

26:53.640 --> 26:55.085
That was awesome!

26:55.520 --> 26:56.567
Awesome!

26:58.000 --> 26:59.843
Perfect. Okay.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.207
One,

27:01.520 --> 27:02.681
two,

27:03.440 --> 27:04.885
three.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.726
Hey, Mr. Dunne.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.207
Hello, Baxter.
How are you?
Good to see you.

27:38.280 --> 27:39.406
Here you go, honey.

27:39.480 --> 27:40.970
Thank you, Mr. Dunne!
Bye, Dad!

27:42.280 --> 27:43.691
Isn't that good?
Mmm-hmm.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.770
Mr. Dunne!

27:49.360 --> 27:51.442
Mr. Dunne!

27:51.720 --> 27:53.961
Hey, Mr. Dunne!

27:55.360 --> 27:56.805
Do you mind?

27:56.880 --> 27:58.291
<i>Bon appétit, kid!</i>

28:13.840 --> 28:14.966
Lloyd!

28:15.880 --> 28:17.086
What are you doing?

28:17.280 --> 28:19.203
I was trying to
clean off this smudge!

28:19.280 --> 28:20.406
But you know what?

28:20.840 --> 28:23.127
I think it might
be on the inside!

28:26.200 --> 28:28.441
<i>This type
of evening always provides</i>

28:28.560 --> 28:29.641
<i>nonstop surprises.</i>

28:29.720 --> 28:31.290
<i>Ah, look who's arrived.
Tom Brady</i>

28:31.640 --> 28:34.484
<i>with his gorgeous wife,
Gisele, by his side.</i>

28:34.640 --> 28:37.689
<i>Doesn't she look radiant?
Tom's in agreement, I think.</i>

28:39.200 --> 28:41.328
Now that is hot.

28:41.880 --> 28:43.006
Yep-

28:43.360 --> 28:45.681
That's why he gets
all the girls.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.802
It sure would be nice.

29:03.560 --> 29:04.721
What would be nice, Lloyd?

29:05.160 --> 29:06.924
Oh! You know,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
if she introduced me to
one of her hot girlfriends.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.804
Girlfriends.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.245
She's 22!

29:12.600 --> 29:13.806
So?

29:13.880 --> 29:16.281
So, that's a lot
younger than you.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.881
Don't worry,
when we get home,

29:17.960 --> 29:19.962
I'm gonna fix you up
with someone your own age.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.202
My age? Gross!

29:23.360 --> 29:24.850
I mean, what would
we talk about?

29:25.400 --> 29:27.448
I don't know.
Same stuff you talked
about in high school

29:27.560 --> 29:30.803
when you took chicks down to
Oyster Swallow Cove.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.564
Oyster Swallow Cove.

29:33.320 --> 29:34.970
There's a trip down
Mammary Lane.

29:40.600 --> 29:41.806
Oh, crap!

29:41.880 --> 29:43.211
We gotta get
back to Providence!

29:43.520 --> 29:44.726
What? Why?

29:44.800 --> 29:46.131
Remember I told you
Ice Pick had to make

29:46.200 --> 29:47.531
that rock candy
run down to Maine?

29:47.600 --> 29:48.681
Yeah.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.882
I forgot to get someone to
feed Butthole.

29:51.280 --> 29:53.123
Relax. I took care of it.

29:53.680 --> 29:54.806
You did?

29:54.880 --> 29:57.326
Yeah. Billy in 4-C's
gonna feed him.

29:57.920 --> 29:59.809
Oh, great!

29:59.960 --> 30:01.600
Did you give him the key
to our apartment?

30:01.640 --> 30:02.687
No.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.603
You think
I want wheel
marks all over the rug?

30:04.680 --> 30:06.205
I just wrote him a note,
left some food

30:06.280 --> 30:08.567
and threw Butthole inside his
place when we were leaving.

30:09.840 --> 30:13.561
But, Lloyd, Billy has over a
hundred rare birds in there!

30:14.160 --> 30:15.241
So?

30:15.480 --> 30:17.926
They're not gonna mess
with a 30-pound alley cat.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.241
Sheesh!

30:20.480 --> 30:22.687
Hey, gang! I'm home!

30:24.120 --> 30:25.246
Guys?

30:27.160 --> 30:28.286
You sure are quiet.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.209
Speak to me, Siskel.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.647
The horror! The horror!

30:43.240 --> 30:44.969
Are you sure you
don't wanna come, Dad?

30:45.040 --> 30:47.441
It's not gonna be nearly
as much fun without you.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.249
Oh, of course
I wanna come, monkey,

30:49.320 --> 30:50.606
but it's out
of the question.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.721
I'm way too
flu-ey to travel.

30:53.800 --> 30:56.485
But all the geeky science guys
are gonna be so disappointed.

30:56.560 --> 30:59.006
They were finally gonna
get to meet you in person!

30:59.080 --> 31:00.081
So sorry, honey.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.401
Ms. Pinchelow,
your car is here.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.726
Thanks, Travis!

31:04.640 --> 31:05.846
Okay!

31:05.920 --> 31:07.524
Take care
of my dad, Adele.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.401
Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa!

31:09.520 --> 31:11.320
Penny, do you have the
speech I wrote for you?

31:11.440 --> 31:12.521
I do.

31:12.640 --> 31:13.721
Good. Oh!

31:13.840 --> 31:15.400
I almost forgot.
There's one more thing.

31:16.160 --> 31:18.288
I want you
to take this box

31:18.640 --> 31:21.849
and personally give it to the head
of the conference, Dr. Walcott,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.924
and say how sorry I am
that I can't be there.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.047
Got it.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.043
Oh, what's in the box, honey?
Mmm.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.003
Just a small gift.

31:30.120 --> 31:32.043
Wow, Penny.
You're giving a speech?

31:32.200 --> 31:34.771
Oh, it's only a couple of
sentences on the last day,

31:34.960 --> 31:37.122
but then I'm picking up
a reward for my dad.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.440
Award, honey.

31:38.840 --> 31:40.968
Did you remember
to bring the ATM card
I gave you?

31:41.120 --> 31:44.761
Yes. But what's
my PIN number again?
I keep forgetting.

31:44.960 --> 31:46.724
It's 11-11.

31:48.760 --> 31:50.762
I thought it had
to be four numbers.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.086
There are four numbers.

31:53.480 --> 31:56.165
One-one-one-one.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.801
Time to go!
Come on, Penny.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.446
Aw!

32:15.480 --> 32:18.962
Are you smiling at me?
Are you smiling at me?

32:19.200 --> 32:21.362
He's a good boy!
Yes, he is!

32:21.440 --> 32:23.010
Let me see
your purty teeth!

32:23.080 --> 32:24.366
Oh! Say it,
don't spray it!

32:36.240 --> 32:39.130
We're almost there.
The guy told me to
get off at the next exit.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.929
Shh. They're picking
the lottery balls.

32:41.200 --> 32:44.602
<i>Here's today's Mega-Lottery
picks, worth 34 million dollars.</i>

32:44.840 --> 32:47.889
<i>The first number is 44.
The next is 2.</i>

32:48.160 --> 32:52.131
<i>38, 24, 21 and 54.</i>

32:52.440 --> 32:55.728
Cripes! I was so close!

32:56.080 --> 32:58.287
I had all the right numbers,
but in the wrong order.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.642
<i>Honey,
my stomach is killing me.</i>

33:04.800 --> 33:06.325
<i>Can you bring me
some more Pepto?</i>

33:06.480 --> 33:08.403
I'm making you some
nice warm oatmeal.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.330
It will settle your tummy.

33:23.720 --> 33:24.926
What are you doing?

33:27.720 --> 33:29.722
I'm fixing lunch
for my husband.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.685
That's not enough.

33:43.720 --> 33:46.405
We gotta pick up
the pace a little bit.
We want him dead

33:46.520 --> 33:49.330
before Dumbelina gets back from
that egghead convention, remember?

33:49.400 --> 33:51.084
Slow it down.

33:51.160 --> 33:54.050
If we put too much in at once,
it could show up in an autopsy.

33:54.120 --> 33:55.246
Not this stuff.

33:55.640 --> 33:57.881
I got it from
my twin brother.
He's Special Ops.

33:58.040 --> 33:59.565
It's totally undetectable.

34:00.720 --> 34:02.768
Now come on.
Let's hurry this up.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.044
That way we have a few
extra days to ourselves,

34:05.120 --> 34:06.804
to enjoy our inheritance.

34:07.160 --> 34:09.322
Oh, there's gonna be
plenty of time for that.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.163
Five million dollars buys
a lot of champagne.

34:18.560 --> 34:19.686
Give it to me.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.371
You like that,
don't you?

34:28.639 --> 34:30.404
Yeah. It's all right.

34:32.120 --> 34:33.804
I'll be honest.
It's not my favorite thing.

34:36.159 --> 34:37.571
Who the hell is that?

34:40.480 --> 34:42.289
Boy, this is quite
a shack, huh, Har?

34:42.440 --> 34:44.806
Yeah, but I bet if you pulled
the weeds off the walls

34:44.920 --> 34:47.764
and slapped up
some aluminum siding,
it wouldn't be half bad.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.411
Yeah. Those things
are rat ladders.

34:50.920 --> 34:52.081
<i>Please stop that.</i>

34:52.159 --> 34:54.925
<i>There's a very sick man in
here who's trying to rest.</i>

34:55.080 --> 34:58.562
I'm sorry, lady! We're
looking for Fanny Felcher!

34:59.640 --> 35:00.846
The one with the kidneys.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.046
Is she there?

35:02.280 --> 35:04.601
There is no one here
by that horrible name.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.041
Now go away.

35:06.120 --> 35:08.771
Is this 6765
Elmwood Avenue,

35:08.840 --> 35:10.604
Cranston,
Rhode Island?

35:11.400 --> 35:12.811
You're in Maryland.

35:13.160 --> 35:14.650
The side with the stamp!

35:14.800 --> 35:17.770
I mean, uh,
is this 1111 Foothill Road?

35:17.840 --> 35:18.966
<i>That's right.</i>

35:19.040 --> 35:20.246
But there are
no Felchers here.

35:20.320 --> 35:22.004
This is the Pinchelow
residence.

35:22.160 --> 35:24.242
Wait a second.
My friend Harry here

35:24.400 --> 35:26.880
gave his daughter up for
adoption 20-something years ago

35:27.040 --> 35:29.042
and we were told this
is where she lives.

35:29.120 --> 35:30.246
It's kind of a medical

35:30.680 --> 35:31.806
<i>emergency
that we find her.</i>

35:31.880 --> 35:33.723
<i>As long as she
doesn't have AIDS.</i>

35:33.800 --> 35:35.325
<i>Adele, darling,
whoever they are,</i>

35:35.400 --> 35:36.811
<i>they must be
talking about Penny!</i>

35:36.880 --> 35:38.120
<i>She was adopted.</i>

35:38.520 --> 35:40.682
<i>I'll see them.
Let them in.</i>

35:42.760 --> 35:44.205
What the hell was that?

35:44.840 --> 35:46.842
That's exactly the kind of
random crap we don't need!

35:46.920 --> 35:48.046
Relax.

35:52.440 --> 35:54.124
Would you like some
hot tea with lemon?

35:54.520 --> 35:57.000
Oh, no. I can see
why you might think that.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.044
Two gentlemen
traveling together.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.281
But we're straight.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.525
I must tell you, Harry,

36:04.400 --> 36:06.243
this is an unexpected treat.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.046
Yeah! Me, too.

36:08.520 --> 36:12.320
You know, I always wondered what
Penny's natural father was like.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.205
When my late wife
and I adopted her,

36:14.280 --> 36:16.561
we weren't given much information
about her birth parents.

36:16.680 --> 36:20.082
We were only told
that her mother was single
and that she was...

36:22.000 --> 36:23.411
You can say it, dear.

36:23.880 --> 36:25.882
She was rumored
to be a titanic whore.

36:26.040 --> 36:29.362
That's a lie! Fraida never
stepped foot on the Titanic!

36:29.720 --> 36:31.722
They must be talking about the
time she did the night crew

36:31.800 --> 36:33.484
on the Block Island Ferry.

36:34.640 --> 36:35.687
That's good!

36:36.920 --> 36:38.922
So, is Penny here?

36:39.080 --> 36:40.241
Unfortunately, no.

36:40.320 --> 36:41.845
She flew out
this morning to El Paso.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.684
She's going to
the KEN Conference.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.121
What? Who's this Ken guy?

36:46.200 --> 36:47.361
No. No.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.242
The KEN Conference
is a symposium

36:50.400 --> 36:51.731
where the year's
newest technologies,

36:51.800 --> 36:53.131
creative concepts
and ideas

36:53.200 --> 36:54.929
are introduced
and discussed.

36:55.200 --> 36:56.406
Wow.

36:56.480 --> 36:59.450
That's the single
most boring sentence
I ever heard.

36:59.560 --> 37:02.166
Adele, what do you say
we call Penny right now

37:02.280 --> 37:04.647
with the news that her biological
father is looking for her?

37:04.760 --> 37:06.171
She'll be so excited.

37:06.920 --> 37:10.049
She might not be as excited
as you think, Doc.

37:10.160 --> 37:12.288
When her mother tried to
get in touch with her,

37:12.440 --> 37:14.363
she sent this
letter right back.

37:16.320 --> 37:17.321
Mmm.

37:17.680 --> 37:19.045
That's interesting.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.685
What's that, dear?

37:21.120 --> 37:22.531
Uh, nothing.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.011
She just, uh,
never mentioned it.

37:25.320 --> 37:26.680
But that was
a couple of years ago.

37:26.720 --> 37:29.121
I'm sure she'll appreciate
all the trouble you've gone to

37:29.200 --> 37:31.248
to find her.
Let's call her.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.444
It's ringing!

37:44.320 --> 37:45.367
Whoever this is,

37:45.440 --> 37:46.930
we're in the middle of
something really important.

37:47.080 --> 37:48.241
Can you call back later?

37:48.320 --> 37:49.731
No, I can't
call back later.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.400
I have something to
tell you that might freak
you out a little bit,

37:53.880 --> 37:55.291
but this is your dad.

37:55.760 --> 37:57.489
What? Hold on.

37:57.920 --> 38:00.844
Hey, guys, I know
this is weird timing,
but I gotta take this.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.081
It's my dead dad.

38:02.160 --> 38:03.400
She's got me on hold.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.882
Dad, what did you do with
all those Penthouses?

38:06.960 --> 38:08.007
Did you throw them out?

38:08.120 --> 38:09.770
No, they're under
my mattress. Why?

38:09.920 --> 38:12.082
You idiot,
that is Penny's phone!

38:12.200 --> 38:13.201
Oh.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.850
Oh, no. No.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.843
No! This is awful!

38:17.160 --> 38:18.571
She forgot the package!

38:18.640 --> 38:20.483
What are you doing?
You shouldn't be up!

38:21.000 --> 38:22.729
Just relax. We can
overnight it to her.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.484
No! No. We can't.

38:24.640 --> 38:27.211
The culmination of my
life's work is in this box.

38:27.360 --> 38:28.885
It's much too
valuable to ship.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.289
I thought you
said it was just a gift.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.403
Oh, it is.

38:33.480 --> 38:35.482
A gift to all humanity.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.289
I wanted it to be
a surprise, Adele.

38:38.360 --> 38:40.601
That's why I was unveiling
it at the KEN Conference.

38:40.680 --> 38:41.761
Wow.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.880
Something like that's gotta
be worth millions, huh?

38:44.120 --> 38:46.487
Try billions.
Billions?

38:46.600 --> 38:49.171
Oh, yes.
But I won't get a dime.

38:49.440 --> 38:51.761
It would be morally wrong
to profit from this.

38:52.240 --> 38:53.241
Huh?

38:53.560 --> 38:56.131
This box contains one
of the most important

38:56.200 --> 38:58.043
discoveries in
human history

38:58.120 --> 39:01.090
and all mankind deserves
free access to it

39:01.160 --> 39:03.766
and that is why
I have relinquished

39:04.000 --> 39:05.923
all proprietary rights.

39:06.680 --> 39:08.091
Wait, when did
you do that?

39:08.160 --> 39:09.650
It's all in the speech

39:09.720 --> 39:12.200
that Penny's going to read
at the award ceremony.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.803
Oh, my God,
that's so nice!

39:17.680 --> 39:19.842
What in God's name?

39:20.040 --> 39:22.691
You guys sounded busy,
so we built a couch-fort.

39:23.560 --> 39:25.005
You wanna come in,
Dr. P?

39:25.160 --> 39:26.605
Sorry, no girls allowed.

39:27.240 --> 39:28.890
Boys rule, girls drool.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.480
Wait a minute.

39:32.920 --> 39:34.490
I have an idea.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.889
Why don't we have
Harry and Lloyd

39:36.960 --> 39:38.803
hand-deliver the box to Penny?

39:38.880 --> 39:41.850
That way Harry will get to
meet his daughter in person

39:41.920 --> 39:44.241
and you'll be assured
the box gets there safely.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.611
Are you insane?

39:48.760 --> 39:52.242
You think I'm just going
to hand over my invention
to these 10-year-olds?

39:52.320 --> 39:53.970
Oh, don't you worry. We'll
have Travis go with them.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.764
He won't let anything
happen to the box.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.684
And he will lead
them straight to Penny.

39:58.280 --> 39:59.520
You can
count on us, sir.

39:59.920 --> 40:01.285
Our word is our bond.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.604
James Bond.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.686
I'm going with them?
Why the hell did
you tell him that?

40:12.840 --> 40:15.002
Do you not realize what
just fell into our laps?

40:15.160 --> 40:18.209
Our five million just
turned into a billion.

40:18.360 --> 40:19.521
What's wrong
with this thing?

40:19.680 --> 40:21.560
Yeah, but he said he was
gonna give it all away.

40:21.680 --> 40:24.650
Not if we get to Penny before
she reads that speech.

40:37.720 --> 40:38.801
Hey,

40:39.280 --> 40:41.203
when is this
KEN thing, anyway?

40:41.280 --> 40:42.611
It actually starts today,

40:42.760 --> 40:44.842
but Penny doesn't give her speech
until the night of May 2nd.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.610
So that gives us...

40:46.880 --> 40:48.120
How many days
are in April?

40:48.280 --> 40:49.964
"Thirty days
have September,

40:50.040 --> 40:51.804
"all the rest
I can't remember."

40:52.080 --> 40:54.401
Must be 31 because
nothing rhymes with August.

40:54.560 --> 40:56.050
No,
I think it's 32, Har.

40:56.360 --> 40:57.600
April's a leap month.

40:57.760 --> 40:59.683
31.
32.

40:59.760 --> 41:00.841
31.
32.

41:00.920 --> 41:03.082
31.31,1,1,1!
2,2,2!

41:03.160 --> 41:04.605
30! There's 30!

41:04.720 --> 41:05.801
Thank you!

41:06.720 --> 41:07.801
You said 31.

41:07.880 --> 41:09.405
Yeah, but I was closer.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.410
Hey, guys,
where's the box?

41:11.800 --> 41:12.926
What box?

41:13.800 --> 41:15.723
The box with the billion-dollar
invention in it.

41:17.640 --> 41:19.165
Lloyd, what did you
do with the box?

41:19.320 --> 41:21.163
Me? You had it.

41:21.240 --> 41:23.288
No, remember we stopped
at that truck stop

41:23.400 --> 41:24.920
and we were kicking
field goals with it

41:25.000 --> 41:26.331
- out in that parking lot?
- Yeah.

41:26.400 --> 41:28.641
I remember I kicked one
over the telephone wires,
and you said...

41:28.720 --> 41:31.087
You know what,
you're right.
I did have it.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.411
Look at that!

41:37.760 --> 41:39.842
I just saved humanity!

41:40.480 --> 41:42.448
You know what? Maybe I
should hold on to that box.

41:42.640 --> 41:44.529
I don't think so, mister.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.329
Dr. P encrusted that to me.

41:46.520 --> 41:48.960
And I'm gonna make sure
it gets to my daughter,
safe and sound.

41:49.360 --> 41:52.011
Yeah, well, you're doing
a great job so far.

41:52.440 --> 41:54.090
You guys wanna play
"He Who Smelt it"?

41:54.160 --> 41:55.321
Yeah.

41:55.600 --> 41:56.681
What's that?

41:56.760 --> 41:58.922
It's complicated,
so pay attention.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.607
We put the windows up,
first one who smells
a fart gets a point.

42:02.760 --> 42:04.330
If you say who dealt it,

42:04.480 --> 42:05.641
double points.

42:05.760 --> 42:07.125
But if you say
you smelled a fart

42:07.200 --> 42:08.201
and nobody farted,

42:08.280 --> 42:09.406
like if we were just passing
a slaughterhouse...

42:09.480 --> 42:10.561
False fart!

42:10.640 --> 42:13.450
...you lose a point.
And you can't smell
your own farts, either.

42:14.160 --> 42:16.288
Are you guys kidding?
No! No!

42:16.440 --> 42:19.410
I'm not gonna sit around
sniffing your farts like
some kinda truffle pig.

42:19.480 --> 42:20.527
Forget it!

42:20.640 --> 42:22.483
Okay, fine. Lloyd and I
will play one-on-one.

42:22.640 --> 42:23.687
Yeah, head-to-head.

42:23.760 --> 42:25.364
How can you
play one-on-one?

42:25.720 --> 42:27.051
If you smell a fart,
and you didn't do it,

42:27.120 --> 42:28.804
isn't it obvious
the other guy did?

42:31.400 --> 42:33.129
I thought you said
you never played before.

42:33.320 --> 42:35.368
Yeah. Sounds like
he wrote the rulebook.

42:35.880 --> 42:37.405
I think we might have
a hustler here, Har.

42:37.480 --> 42:38.481
Uh-huh.

42:46.160 --> 42:47.321
What are you doing?

42:48.920 --> 42:50.046
I forgot.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.651
Uh, you know what?
I'm going to make a rule.

42:51.880 --> 42:54.201
There will be no fart games
while I'm in the car, got it?

42:54.320 --> 42:55.367
Wow.

42:55.480 --> 42:56.891
Who made you
king of the car?

42:58.000 --> 42:59.240
I know how to settle this.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.368
I'm thinking of a number
between one and three.

43:01.480 --> 43:03.164
Whoever guesses it
gets to be king of the car.

43:03.240 --> 43:04.366
One!
No.

43:04.480 --> 43:05.845
Three?
Nope.

43:07.520 --> 43:08.681
Okay, what is it?

43:10.160 --> 43:11.160
Two.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.527
I swear
I was gonna say that!

43:14.520 --> 43:17.046
All right, so it's agreed,
I'm king of the car, right?

43:17.680 --> 43:18.806
Fine.

43:18.880 --> 43:19.927
Excuse me,
Your Highness,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.401
would you grab me
a Slim Jim
out of the back?

43:23.000 --> 43:24.206
One of the long ones.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.764
Yeah.

43:29.520 --> 43:30.851
Oh, hey,
what the hell?

43:33.040 --> 43:34.405
On, God! Hey!

43:34.520 --> 43:36.045
No! Hey!

43:39.520 --> 43:41.204
What is that?
Oh, God!

43:43.640 --> 43:44.880
Look, Harry.

43:45.040 --> 43:46.405
He's hooked on crack.

43:48.640 --> 43:51.246
For the love of God,
have mercy!

43:51.800 --> 43:53.962
<i>Hello, you've
reached Herbert Felcher</i>

43:54.040 --> 43:56.122
<i>at Felcher and Felcher
Funeral Parlor.</i>

43:56.320 --> 43:58.163
<i>Please leave a
message at the beep.</i>

43:58.280 --> 44:01.250
Hi! This is a private
message for Fraida Felcher.

44:01.320 --> 44:03.641
Would you please tell
Fraida that Harry called?

44:03.720 --> 44:04.926
Harry Dunne.

44:05.240 --> 44:07.891
The guy who knocked her up
20-something years ago.

44:08.160 --> 44:11.323
Um, pleasure finally
meeting you all,
by the way.

44:12.080 --> 44:15.846
Anyway, would you tell her that
I've located our daughter.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.083
She's at a thing called the
KEN Conference in El Paso.

44:20.920 --> 44:22.922
The town named
after the bean dip.

44:51.320 --> 44:52.970
Oh, that's sweet!

44:55.120 --> 44:56.201
Bye, Grandma!

44:56.280 --> 44:57.680
Have fun, sweetie.

45:01.200 --> 45:02.440
Now,
there's a real man.

45:02.960 --> 45:05.201
I bet you he don't
pee sitting down.

45:22.680 --> 45:24.409
Don't touch that joystick!

45:29.520 --> 45:30.965
Wow, look!

45:34.640 --> 45:35.801
Let my people

45:36.320 --> 45:37.401
go!

45:37.480 --> 45:38.561
Harry!

45:42.240 --> 45:44.720
It hurts, Lloyd.
It hurts so bad.

45:44.880 --> 45:47.804
Which one hurts, Harry?
This one? Or this one?

45:47.880 --> 45:50.770
Stop it! Lloyd, please,

45:51.040 --> 45:52.246
save my daughter.

45:52.320 --> 45:53.526
And then

45:53.760 --> 45:56.730
I want you to bone her
like a chicken cutlet.

45:56.840 --> 45:58.080
You hear me, mister?

46:12.640 --> 46:13.641
Huh?

46:38.360 --> 46:39.885
Looking for these?

47:15.080 --> 47:16.445
Oh!

47:18.760 --> 47:20.171
What are you doing?

47:21.240 --> 47:22.810
Oh. Uh...

47:25.520 --> 47:26.760
She's all clean, sir.

47:27.360 --> 47:28.771
You're good to go.

47:29.320 --> 47:30.606
Nutcase.

47:33.200 --> 47:34.611
Hey, guys.

47:40.080 --> 47:41.969
Let's call
a truce, huh?

47:42.280 --> 47:43.770
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

47:44.120 --> 47:46.600
I don't wanna argue with you guys
all the way down to El Paso.

47:47.040 --> 47:48.849
So what do you say?
Peace?

47:50.560 --> 47:52.449
Come on, bring it in!

47:53.160 --> 47:54.924
Yeah, why not?

47:56.960 --> 47:58.007
Hmm.

47:58.080 --> 47:59.127
Okay-

47:59.240 --> 48:02.164
Hey, all right. All right,
that's good. Mmm...

48:02.480 --> 48:04.084
All right, all right, all right.
Aw.

48:04.520 --> 48:06.488
Hey! Have you guys
ever played "Funnel Nuts"?

48:06.800 --> 48:07.847
What?

48:07.960 --> 48:10.167
Oh, come on. You guys have
had to play Funnel Nuts.

48:10.480 --> 48:12.130
This is the best game
ever invented.

48:12.320 --> 48:13.367
Check it out,
you take the funnel,

48:13.480 --> 48:15.005
you put it in the front of
your pants like that, right?

48:15.440 --> 48:18.842
Okay? Then you put a peanut
on your nose like this,

48:19.040 --> 48:20.530
and then when
you're ready...

48:21.280 --> 48:22.725
No way!

48:22.800 --> 48:24.040
You gotta be kidding!

48:24.320 --> 48:25.680
That's not right!

48:26.480 --> 48:28.528
The person who gets
the most nuts wins.

48:28.640 --> 48:29.846
Now, who's gonna
play me first?

48:30.320 --> 48:31.731
I'll do it. I got it.

48:32.200 --> 48:33.884
This is mine!
You always go first!

48:34.040 --> 48:35.166
I got it first!

48:35.280 --> 48:37.123
Guys, hold on,
all right? Look.

48:37.440 --> 48:39.840
You guys play each
other first, and then
I'll play the winner.

48:40.800 --> 48:41.881
All right.

48:42.160 --> 48:44.288
All right.
Here you go.

48:45.160 --> 48:46.491
Take your time.
It takes time.

48:46.560 --> 48:47.846
Get a good balance
on that.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.126
Okay.
Look way up high.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.685
Good. Okay,
keep looking at the sky.
When you're ready.

48:52.800 --> 48:54.529
Now don't drop it
until you're ready, guys.

48:54.640 --> 48:55.801
I got it!

48:57.840 --> 48:58.966
That's weird.
Ooh!

48:59.040 --> 49:01.691
The smell of peanuts makes
my weenie cold.
Ooh!

49:02.800 --> 49:03.847
It shrank mine.

49:05.440 --> 49:06.441
Oh!

49:06.680 --> 49:07.886
Hey!

49:10.320 --> 49:13.244
Do you believe that?
Did you see what he did?

49:14.240 --> 49:15.844
It's on!

49:16.840 --> 49:17.921
Oh, yeah.

49:18.040 --> 49:19.371
He's going down!

49:20.040 --> 49:22.611
Right after we finish
playing Funnel Nuts.

49:34.880 --> 49:36.723
Shh. Don't wake him up!
I know.

49:40.680 --> 49:41.920
How many did you
put in there?

49:42.120 --> 49:44.122
Just enough to get
a rise out of him.

50:01.280 --> 50:02.725
No! Oh, God!

50:03.600 --> 50:05.409
No! Oh, my God!

50:16.760 --> 50:17.886
Oh, my God!

50:19.280 --> 50:21.487
Wait, Lloyd. I think
he might be hurt.

50:24.560 --> 50:27.450
Man, you okay?
It was just a goof.

50:27.720 --> 50:30.451
Yeah. By the way,
we're even.

50:31.440 --> 50:34.091
I want them dead, now!
Now! Do you hear me?

50:34.600 --> 50:35.806
Calm down.

50:35.960 --> 50:37.962
No! No, I can't
take it any longer!

50:38.440 --> 50:39.965
If you don't
let me kill them now,

50:40.040 --> 50:41.405
I am quitting,
and I mean it!

50:41.600 --> 50:44.171
Okay. Give me
some time to think.

50:44.320 --> 50:45.446
<i>I'll come up with a plan.</i>

50:45.640 --> 50:48.644
Plan? You don't need a plan!
These guys are morons!

50:48.800 --> 50:51.246
Besides, I told you,
my brother's in Special Ops.

50:51.440 --> 50:52.771
I know how to
get stuff done!

50:53.480 --> 50:56.848
All right.
But make sure nobody
knows they paid us a visit.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.684
<i>I don't want this
coming back to us.</i>

50:58.840 --> 51:00.330
God, shut up!

51:08.840 --> 51:10.285
I wonder what's
in this sucker.

51:11.480 --> 51:13.005
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

51:13.440 --> 51:15.329
That thing is worth
a fortune! Be careful!

51:15.440 --> 51:16.851
Give it to me.

51:17.320 --> 51:19.607
It would be nice to know
what's in it, though.

51:19.800 --> 51:21.928
I've been racking
my sack about that.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.206
I have a theory.

51:23.520 --> 51:24.681
Oh, yeah?

51:24.800 --> 51:27.326
He said it was something
that would help everybody
in the world, right?

51:27.520 --> 51:28.646
Yeah.

51:28.720 --> 51:31.121
I think it might be
a baked potato.

51:32.320 --> 51:34.527
How does a baked potato
help everybody in the world?

51:35.840 --> 51:38.002
That's the only part
I haven't figured out yet.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.411
You'll get it, Lloyd.

51:40.520 --> 51:43.808
We should pick up some sour
cream and chives, just in case.

51:44.880 --> 51:46.400
Do you guys have any
idea where we are?

51:46.560 --> 51:47.561
Not really.

51:47.640 --> 51:50.166
You're the one who told
us to take the shortcut
off the highway.

51:50.240 --> 51:53.050
Yeah. It's like you wanted to get
us alone, so you could kill us

51:53.160 --> 51:54.924
and take
the billion-dollar box.

51:55.040 --> 51:56.849
But what would
be the motive?

51:57.320 --> 51:58.367
Yeah.

51:59.360 --> 52:00.407
Yeah.

52:01.360 --> 52:02.930
I better get a map
out of the bag, huh?

52:03.040 --> 52:04.724
Sure.
Okay.

52:06.480 --> 52:09.290
So, guys, who else is
helping you look for your daughter?

52:09.360 --> 52:10.520
- No one.
Mmm-hmm.

52:10.560 --> 52:11.561
Nobody?

52:11.680 --> 52:14.047
Not even some friends
to lend a hand?
Mmm-mmm.

52:14.400 --> 52:15.765
Nope, just us.

52:15.880 --> 52:17.723
- What about your wives?
- Wives?

52:17.840 --> 52:19.490
How stupid do we look?

52:21.040 --> 52:22.201
Harry?

52:22.280 --> 52:23.725
Easy.

52:28.040 --> 52:30.168
Close one.
Any girlfriends?

52:30.240 --> 52:31.571
Been there, done that.

52:32.040 --> 52:34.805
See, we don't want to be tied
down by anything or anyone.

52:34.920 --> 52:36.604
We don't even have
social security cards.

52:36.720 --> 52:38.722
We sold them for 30 bucks
to two Brazilian guys.

52:39.240 --> 52:40.765
And the good thing
about having no identity

52:40.880 --> 52:43.326
is that you never have to
worry about identity theft.

52:43.400 --> 52:45.562
He can't even be
identified by his teeth

52:45.800 --> 52:47.564
because he's never
even been to a dentist.

52:47.960 --> 52:50.201
And I've never
joined anything. Ever.

52:50.760 --> 52:52.285
That's how you
keep a low-pro.

52:52.400 --> 52:55.244
Yep, there's no actual
proof that we even exist.

52:55.920 --> 52:58.241
If we died,
no one would
even miss us.

52:58.600 --> 53:00.728
We are truly blessed.

53:16.280 --> 53:18.248
What the hell
happened, Harry?

53:18.760 --> 53:19.966
What?

53:20.240 --> 53:22.527
What the hell happened?

53:22.600 --> 53:25.285
- Whoo!
- I can't hear you!

53:25.480 --> 53:26.891
So long, boys.

53:41.960 --> 53:45.203
We may have been involved in
an alien abduction, Harry.

53:45.480 --> 53:46.891
Is your butt okay?

53:49.440 --> 53:50.646
Harry!

53:50.800 --> 53:52.211
Holy crap!

53:52.280 --> 53:53.770
He took off on us!

53:54.160 --> 53:55.321
What?

53:55.640 --> 53:59.008
He took off on us.

53:59.880 --> 54:01.120
What?

54:02.280 --> 54:05.124
I can't believe that
douchebag stole our hearse.

54:05.800 --> 54:07.962
I hope something really
bad happens to him.

54:08.120 --> 54:10.726
No, but I tried
ostrich once.

54:11.320 --> 54:13.527
Harry, holy cow.

54:13.880 --> 54:15.291
I'm worried about you.

54:15.360 --> 54:16.805
You're as deaf as a bat.

54:17.280 --> 54:19.886
That's not exactly
how it happened, Lloyd.

54:20.040 --> 54:22.805
Your mother got
into bed with me.

54:24.720 --> 54:27.200
That's it.
We're getting
you hearing aids.

54:31.160 --> 54:32.525
May I help you?

54:33.520 --> 54:34.521
Um...

54:34.840 --> 54:37.923
My friend here would like to
visit his sweet ol' grandma.

54:38.640 --> 54:39.687
What's the name?

54:39.880 --> 54:41.041
I'll give you a hint.

54:41.560 --> 54:43.881
She's the one with
the biggest hearing aids.

54:48.760 --> 54:51.491
Ms. Snergle,
your grandson
and his friend are here.

54:54.360 --> 54:55.521
This is stupid, Lloyd!

54:55.600 --> 54:57.682
I'm not gonna steal
an old lady's hearing aid!

54:58.880 --> 55:00.086
Relax!

55:00.240 --> 55:04.404
We're just looking
for a backup pair.

55:04.920 --> 55:06.922
There's gotta be
some around here.

55:11.840 --> 55:13.080
Mikey?

55:14.240 --> 55:15.571
Yeah, Gran.

55:15.720 --> 55:16.801
It's Mikey.

55:16.880 --> 55:19.087
Oh, thank
God you're here.

55:19.400 --> 55:21.209
I've got the diamonds.

55:22.040 --> 55:23.405
Did she say diamonds?

55:25.720 --> 55:28.246
Go ahead, Granny.
Mikey's listening.

55:28.400 --> 55:31.563
I want you to take all the
diamonds with you when you go.

55:31.760 --> 55:34.764
I've been hiding them
from those thieving lawyers.

55:34.920 --> 55:36.081
That's good.

55:36.240 --> 55:37.924
Granny did a good thing!

55:38.080 --> 55:40.208
So, where are the rocks?

55:40.440 --> 55:42.044
They're underneath me.

55:42.120 --> 55:43.246
You mean,
under the bed?

55:43.400 --> 55:45.402
No, under the blanket.
Oh.

55:51.040 --> 55:52.246
I'm not finding anything.

55:52.400 --> 55:54.243
Go up more.

55:55.720 --> 55:57.324
Up here?
Keep going.

55:58.880 --> 56:00.484
Did you hide them
inside this turkey?

56:00.800 --> 56:01.961
Yeah, right.

56:02.200 --> 56:03.964
Wait.

56:04.240 --> 56:05.605
There's no diamonds here!

56:05.760 --> 56:08.331
And you're not
my grandson!

56:08.800 --> 56:10.290
Harry, she's got me.

56:10.920 --> 56:12.251
She's really clamping down!

56:13.800 --> 56:15.211
Ahhh!

56:17.240 --> 56:18.401
Lloyd?

56:18.680 --> 56:20.762
I think that
was her gran-gina.

56:20.840 --> 56:22.001
That's right!

56:22.160 --> 56:25.130
So you can cross that one
off your bucket list!

56:28.840 --> 56:31.969
Hey, Goldfinger!

56:32.480 --> 56:34.244
Here.

56:34.480 --> 56:36.482
You've earned them.

56:45.520 --> 56:47.010
Are you serious?

56:47.280 --> 56:48.964
Travis is dead?

56:49.320 --> 56:50.367
<i>That's right.</i>

56:50.480 --> 56:52.400
<i>The Kansas state police
informed me this morning.</i>

56:52.480 --> 56:54.164
<i>I thought
you'd want to know.</i>

56:55.320 --> 56:57.846
Thank you,
Captain Lippincott.

56:58.200 --> 57:01.363
I know it's never easy to
relay this kind of sad news.

57:01.720 --> 57:03.768
But I want you to know
that your brother, Travis,

57:03.840 --> 57:05.683
was more than just
a handyman to us.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.001
He was

57:07.680 --> 57:08.966
family.

57:09.520 --> 57:10.646
<i>Really?</i>

57:11.120 --> 57:14.363
<i>Do you suck the toe jam
off Mommy and Daddy, too?</i>

57:15.480 --> 57:17.642
Um, I beg your pardon?

57:18.360 --> 57:20.089
My brother
told me everything.

57:23.800 --> 57:25.320
I don't know what
you're talking about.

57:25.400 --> 57:27.767
Look, lady, I know you're
terminating your husband.

57:27.880 --> 57:29.928
I'm the one who supplied
you with the untraceables.

57:30.240 --> 57:31.810
Remember? I also know

57:31.880 --> 57:34.531
that my brother was supposed
to eliminate those two idiots,

57:34.880 --> 57:37.008
but somehow they
turned the tables on him.

57:38.160 --> 57:39.366
Relax.

57:39.560 --> 57:40.891
I'm not here
to turn you in.

57:41.760 --> 57:43.171
I'm here to
help you out.

57:48.520 --> 57:49.760
So how are those
things working?

57:49.880 --> 57:51.689
Not bad.
I can hear you a little.

57:51.840 --> 57:53.046
Here, let me
turn them up.

57:56.880 --> 57:58.928
Honey, would you
like some pancakes?

57:59.560 --> 58:00.891
Yeah, I'd love
some pancakes.

58:01.080 --> 58:02.127
What?

58:03.440 --> 58:05.568
Stop yelling!
I'm not yelling.

58:05.840 --> 58:07.285
Why would you say
I'm yelling?

58:07.440 --> 58:09.090
This is yelling!

58:12.400 --> 58:13.606
Harry!

58:15.560 --> 58:17.801
I think I might have
turned them up too high!

58:19.240 --> 58:21.811
Oh, look!
Barbara Hershey Highway.

58:23.800 --> 58:24.961
Wait a minute.

58:25.920 --> 58:27.968
I think I know
where we are.

58:28.280 --> 58:29.611
Follow me.

58:37.080 --> 58:38.809
Are you sure
about this, Lloyd?

58:38.960 --> 58:42.760
Positive. The kid
worked at the hockey rink
just past the museum.

58:44.600 --> 58:45.806
Come on, Harry!

58:47.440 --> 58:49.329
He drove a Zamboni!

58:58.120 --> 59:01.249
Oh, my God.
I never thought
I'd see her again.

59:01.960 --> 59:03.849
I don't know if
I told you this, Har,

59:04.440 --> 59:07.000
but that kid kinda porked me when
I traded him for the mini bike.

59:07.640 --> 59:10.120
And he only gave me
a quarter-tank of gas.

59:12.680 --> 59:14.489
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

59:40.480 --> 59:41.720
Yeah!

59:58.720 --> 59:59.846
Bush club!

59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.531
Bush club! Bush club!
Bush club!

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.650
I feel really good, Har.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.846
Me, too!

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.365
Really good!

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.848
You might want to
step on it, Har!

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.090
Wow, look at
all the brains.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.242
They're
blinding me with science!

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.760
Okay, Lloyd. I'm gonna find out
what time this thing starts.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.126
You keep an eye
out for Penny.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.401
Roger that.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.770
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is an AMBER Alert.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.811
Has anybody seen this
lovely, delicate angel?

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:08.406
Have you seen her?
Lovely and delicate.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.284
This girl is slammin'.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.370
Oh, yeah, sure,
I know her.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.561
I got a hit.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.687
It's, uh,
Penny Pinchelow.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.960
I met her at
the bar yesterday.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.160
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.929
Whoa! Easy, hoser!

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.047
We just hung out a little.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.761
Oh.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.840
Do you happen to know
where she is right now?

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.561
Yeah, my, uh, friends
just went to meet her
at her hotel room.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.687
They're walking
her over here.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.920
She's giving
a speech tonight.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.201
When you see her,

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.442
tell her that Lloyd and her
dad are looking for her.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.807
And get her to
call me on this.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.446
There you are!

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.360
I've been looking
all over for you.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.046
Cool!

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.963
I just ran into a Mexican
guy who knows Penny.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.087
He said she's on her way!

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.611
Come on,
let's get in line.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.170
Dressed like this?

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.767
Harry, people who come to
these things are smart.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.807
We can't go in there looking
like a couple of goofballs.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.401
Oh, yeah. Let's go buy
some smart stuff.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.246
How's your day?

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.331
Living the dream.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.840
Ooh, that mac and
cheese looks good!

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.968
Um, I think I'm gonna
need some chopsticks

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.850
or a really,
really skinny fork.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.685
You got it.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.606
It's open!

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.046
Hey, Penny!

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.288
Hey, Tom!
Hey, Gus!

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.522
Hey, uh,
Penny. Um...

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.320
What are you doing
in your undies

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.727
in front of the room
service guy here, eh?

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:53.961
You don't know him.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.163
Oh, no. Someone told me
this great trick about
how not to get nervous

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.605
when you're
giving a speech.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:01.047
All you do is imagine that
you're in your underwear.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.522
So I've been practicing
all afternoon.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.091
Will there be
anything else, ma'am?

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.089
Oh, no.
Just that skinny fork.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.601
Right.

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:10.371
Okay. Burning daylight.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.966
Yeah. Oh! Great news. Your dad
showed up for the conference.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.607
What?
Yeah, Gordy just called us.

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.007
He ran into some guy named Lloyd
who was with your father.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.731
They were looking for them out
front of the convention hall.

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.883
Oh, my goodness.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.448
Are you absolutely certain?

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.765
And there's no way
you're mistaken?

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.802
All right, um, yes,
then I'll have someone

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.245
meet him at the
door in a hurry.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.129
Yes, okay. Goodbye.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.446
What is it?

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.164
Dr. Pinchelow is coming.

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.846
What? Are you certain?
I thought he was sick!

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.081
Apparently he's better.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.605
I just spoke with his
daughter, Penny,
on the phone

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.125
and she's headed right
over here to meet him.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.400
Oh, the man didn't even show
up for his Nobel ceremony.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.284
He showed up for us.
Go find him.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.965
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I'm on it.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.921
Lloyd, look!

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.765
Penny is speaking soon.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.689
That's so hot.

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.965
Is it done?
No.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.806
Some Canadian douchebags barged
in before I could finish her.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.121
Okay-

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.807
You follow Penny, and the next
chance you get, kill her.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.689
I'll take out the guys,
get the box.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.929
What if they have already
gone into the KEN conference?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.161
Not a chance.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:39.409
The event's been sold
out for over a year,
and the security is insane.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.806
Tickets, please.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.451
No, thank you.

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.284
We're not much
for boring speeches.

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.211
We just have to make sure that
his daughter gets this box.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:50.689
No tickie, no entry.
No exceptions.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.325
<i>Have you found
Dr. Pinchelow yet?</i>

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.402
No. I don't even know
what he looks like.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.561
This is ridiculous.

01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.369
How am I supposed to find
the man in this throng

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:02.245
when all I know about him is
that he wears hearing aids?

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.324
Great. It's sold out.
I'm dead.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.209
So much for
higher education.

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:12.401
Relax, Har.

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.563
We're gonna find her.
Don't get that dying
kidney all worked up.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.091
Oh, it's not the kidney.

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.605
I think I gotta
pinch a loaf.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.571
Pinchelow?
Did someone
say Pinchelow?

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.683
Oh, my goodness,
it is you!

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:26.207
You're really here!
I'm Dr. Meldmann.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.606
How was your trip
from Maryland?

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:28.927
Not so great.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.401
Somebody stole our car and he
finger-bombed an old lady.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.441
Sounds terrible.

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.204
We'll take really good care
of you now that you're here.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.611
Uh, would you like
to go into the foyer

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.320
for the cocktail reception,
Dr. Pinchelow?

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.444
Oh. Yes, Dr. Pinchelow
would love to go

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.284
to the foyer for
the cocktail reception.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.363
Yeah, cool.
Let's get ripped.

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.922
Uh, this way, please.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.204
I'm sorry, your name is?

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.209
I'm his associate,
Dr. Christmas.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.884
Ah, Christmas
like the holiday?

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:56.883
No.
Like the tree.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.000
May I ask you
a question, Doctor,

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.485
and I don't mean
to be insensitive,

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.490
but, uh, does Dr. Pinchelow
have Asperger's?

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.880
Probably.

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.202
I know he doesn't
wipe real well.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.369
Why don't you gentlemen
make yourselves at home.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.841
I'm gonna go fetch the, uh,
director of the conference,

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.331
Dr. Barbara Walcott.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.084
She can't
wait to meet you.

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.970
Dr. Barbara?
A lady doctor?
Seriously?

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.722
Lady doctor, that
always cracks me up.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.802
Yeah, doctor of doing
the laundry, maybe.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.921
Am I right?

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.166
I'll be right back.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.285
What were you
thinking, Lloyd?

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:36.725
Now he thinks
we're doctors.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.404
At least we're
in the door.

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.483
Now all we gotta do
is act intelligent.
We'll fit right in.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.601
Okay-

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.765
Hi, barkeep.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.445
How much for a beer?
It's gratis.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.326
Ooh.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.845
That sounds expensive.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.364
Can you give
us a moment?

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.248
Lloyd, we blew our money
on the graduation robes.

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.481
Maybe we shouldn't drink.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.364
No way.
I need booze, man.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.045
If I meet your daughter
without a buzz on,

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:02.321
she'll think
I'm an idiot.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.046
Hey,
wait a minute!

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:09.047
What about
the old Stinkeroo?

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.203
Yeah, I'm in.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.369
Excuse me, ma'am.
Yes?

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.641
This beer smells funky.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.006
Can I have
a new one, please?

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.721
What do you mean "funky"?

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.606
Go ahead, take a sniff.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.966
Ew!

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.801
I'll get you a freshie.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.530
Mine is stinky, too.

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:54.569
Yours smells even worse!

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:56.842
I'll be right back.

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.050
"Yours smells even worse."

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.321
Thanks!

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:01.885
You're really good
at that, Lloyd.

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.526
I learned from the best.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.331
Thanks, Mom.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.524
I can't wait to see
what's in this.

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.922
Yeah. Hey, Har?
Mmm?

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.161
Do you know how long
you have to wait

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.242
after kidney surgery
to have sex?

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.004
I don't think I'll
have to wait too long.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.447
No, not you.
I meant the donor chick.

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:20.562
What are you talking about?
Okay! Fine!

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:21.920
Let's just drop it!

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.411
Here you go,
doctors.

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:24.841
Fresh beers.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.685
And I also brought you some
hydroponically grown goji berries

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.205
with vegan barbecue sauce

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:32.567
and some organic
pumpkin chips. Enjoy.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.091
Why, thank you!
Mmm.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.291
Mmm.

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:40.201
Mmm.

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:42.129
These are salty.
Mmm-hmm.

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.446
Try these.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:47.881
Mmm.

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.765
Yours are super tangy.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.050
I like it a lot.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.246
Gentlemen.

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:55.810
I'd like you to meet the
director of the conference,

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:56.961
Dr. Barbara Walcott.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.962
And, Barbara,
this is Dr. Pinchelow

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.282
and his associate,
Dr. Christmas.

01:09:01.439 --> 01:09:04.886
Wonderful. It is a high
honor to meet you both.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.439
Wow. Great accent, doc.
Where you from?

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:08.890
England. Surrey.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.520
Oh, no need to apologize.
That was years ago.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.568
We kicked your butt anyway,
so we're cool with it.

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.920
Oh,
you're a leg-puller!

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:21.486
Let's get you
both to your seats.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.926
Professor Garabedian's
KEN talk is about to begin.

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:28.005
Now, the existence of dark
matter is largely inferred

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:31.323
from the gravitational
effect on visible matter

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:35.446
and the gravitational lensing
of background radiation.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.602
We saved two seats for you at
the end of the second row.

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:38.680
Just there.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:44.207
...because they were trying to
figure out the discrepancies...

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:45.566
You could actually
go in the front.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.368
- Coming through.
- My bad!

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.965
Here we go. Oops!

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.929
Wow. Is that silk?

01:09:53.479 --> 01:09:54.686
That sucks!

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.129
That's good. Sorry.

01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:58.886
Watch my knee.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.760
We make a better door
than a window, don't we?

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.603
I hope this isn't
your favorite part.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.843
There are a couple
of hotties over here.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.371
I got it!
Oh!

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.964
That was easy!

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.530
That Dr. Pinchelow is certainly
a fascinating character.

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:16.808
Of course he is.
He's a genius.

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.523
Indeed, the Large Hadron
Collider has already shown us

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.648
that dark matter
is likely...

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.325
Especially when
you eat prunes!

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.207
Yes.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.007
That dark
matter is likely...

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.561
...the missing piece
of the puzzle

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.327
that physicists have been
searching for, for years.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.247
Nerd!

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.209
Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:48.563
Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:51.001
<i>Excuse me, gentlemen.</i>

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.765
Holy crap!

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.200
Did that come from you?

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:57.722
<i>Dr. Garabedian is a
world-renowned astrophysicist</i>

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:00.725
<i>and many of us are interested
in hearing his findings.</i>

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.367
I'm reading his mind. Mmm-hmm.
I'm picking it up, too.

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.249
Who is that?

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.004
It's Dr. Pinchelow!

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.886
Bernard Pinchelow?

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.362
<i>- Dark matter is not</i> a <i>joke.</i>

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:17.771
<i>Your antics are proving
to be disruptive.</i>

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.366
Thank you, Dr. Dilbeck,

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:22.966
but Dr. Pinchelow is right.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.405
My dark matter data was insufficient.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.247
<i>What the fuck?</i>

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.369
My methods were sloppy.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.405
I'm a hack.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.403
I'm really sorry.

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:42.241
See?

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.050
<i>Eat me.
Suck it!</i>

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.647
You <i>wish.</i>
Lloyd. Lloyd.

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.041
<i>Thank you,
Professor Garabedian.</i>

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.409
<i>That's what the KEN
Conference is all about.</i>

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:52.927
<i>Truth.</i>

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.088
<i>But I will ask that
everyone please behave</i>

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:56.730
<i>in a professional
and dignified...</i>

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:58.570
Show us your tits!

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.520
- Both Of them!
- Yeah!

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.967
<i>We're just gonna take a short
two-minute break. Thank you!</i>

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.086
Man.

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:09.366
Hey, this is great!

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.681
We're learning so much
about dark matter.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.807
Yes, indeed.

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.046
Uh, I'm sorry,
Dr. Pinchelow,

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:19.124
but we can't seem to find Dr.
Christmas on the roster.

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.924
Oh, that's okay.
He's with me.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:25.165
Due to security concerns everyone
must be on the list to get in.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.125
It's all right, Doctor.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.287
I think I know a shakedown
when I see one.

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:31.641
I'll tell you what.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:35.128
I'm gonna write an IOU
and I'm gonna leave it blank.

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.766
Anybody have a pen?

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.446
There are no exceptions.

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.080
Really?

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.366
I'll tell you what, warden.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:43.966
If I'm leaving,

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.487
then my steamed colleague
is leaving with me.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.840
No, he's not.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.121
Quick conference.

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.130
What are you doing, Har?

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.601
You're killing me!
Lloyd, I can't leave.

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.570
Penny is gonna be speaking soon.
I wanna meet her!

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:02.721
What?

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.484
How come you get to
meet her before I do?

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.602
Lloyd, this is about me.

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:09.170
Me, my daughter
and my kidney.

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.810
That's why we're
here, remember?

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.849
How can I forget? It's
all you ever talk about.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.450
Penny and my kidney.
My kidney and Penny.

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:16.680
To tell you the truth, I'm
getting a little sick of it.

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.086
Wait a minute.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.844
I know what
you're up to, mister.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.761
You wanna stay because
you're hot for my daughter!

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:26.241
What?
Am I right?

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.731
That's insane!

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.921
Don't deny it, Lloyd!

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.365
You have been
drooling over her

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.408
ever since you
first saw her picture.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.561
So what?

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:36.166
I'm not gonna apologize for letting
nature take its course, Har.

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.448
I hate to burst
your butthole, mister.

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:39.681
It ain't gonna happen.

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.047
It's my job to
protect my daughter.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:43.207
Protect her?

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.011
Look who's talking!

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.009
You're trying to swindle
her out of a kidney!

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.685
At least I'm gonna
marry her.

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:51.801
Marry her? No.

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.769
You're not gonna marry.
Why not?

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:56.605
No! Lloyd, you are not going
to marry my daughter.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.571
Why? Because she's a tick younger than me?
Get over it.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.881
Age is just a letter, man.

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:04.249
It's got nothing
to do with age!
It's got to do...

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:06.726
With what?

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.205
I'm her father, Lloyd,

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.131
and, frankly,

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.565
I think she can do better.

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.526
Oh...

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.211
Okay-

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.448
Time to go, Doctor.
All right, buddy.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.410
- Harry?
- Let's go.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.241
Harry?

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:52.801
Harry?

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.961
Dr. Walcott just
had a wonderful idea.

01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.161
How would you like
to come with us

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.242
and judge the Young
Inventors competition?

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.683
Yeah, cool.
Let's judge shit.

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.970
Hey! Hey!

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.602
So this is what
rock bottom feels like.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.761
Mmm, not that bad.

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.521
Hello?

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:30.523
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:31.886
Hello?

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.286
Penny?

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:35.442
I can't hear you,
you're breaking up.

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:36.806
Penny?

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:40.691
Penny! How's this?

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.010
<i>Just</i> hang on.
Don't <i>go</i> anywhere.

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:49.847
<i>Can you hear me now?</i>

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:51.485
Yes, I can hear you now.

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:54.484
Good! I can hear
you loud and clear.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.241
This is Lloyd,
your dad's good buddy.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:00.564
Unfortunately, I don't
have him at the moment,

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.447
but, uh, he wanted me to ask you
to find a nice, romantic place

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.090
where we can all meet.

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.087
No, by "romantic"
I meant convenient.

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:13.644
And it has to be some place
outside the convention center.

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:19.728
The fountain? On Main Street?
In 10 minutes?

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.166
Perfect!

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:23.526
Yes!

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.048
It's marvelous
to meet you, Mrs. Pinchelow.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:27.844
I trust you had
a safe journey in?

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.046
It was lovely.

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.527
Great. We have a seat saved
for you in the front row.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:34.251
We're just about to introduce
your charming husband.

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.045
My husband?

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.049
<i>So let's
give a warm, KEN welcome</i>

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.963
<i>to our very
distinguished judge,</i>

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.088
<i>Dr. Bernard Pinchelow.</i>

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.246
Hi!

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.606
Hello!

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.805
How about a hug?

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.320
Sure!

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.401
Oh!

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.971
I love hellos.

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.964
Oh, me, too.

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.241
Wow!

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.606
You're really
sweet, mister,

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:56.082
but I'm waiting for my dad and his
friend, so if you'll excuse me.

01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:00.442
No, it's me, Lloyd!

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.090
Hi, Lloyd, I'm Penny.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.488
On! Lloyd! Hi!

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:06.649
It's so nice to meet you!

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.323
Um, where's my dad?

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:13.806
Uh, he was delayed, so, uh,
he asked me to come by

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.001
and entertain you...

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.165
...until he can
meet up with us.

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.202
I think he wanted us
to have a chance to bond.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.131
James Bond.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:27.806
Great!

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:29.723
Are you hungry? Can I get
you something to eat?

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:31.290
Sure!

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.880
Awesome!

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:38.687
Wow!

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.126
We can go somewhere nice.

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.406
Sounds yummy!

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.405
Here, try this.

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.210
This is incredible popcorn.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:49.409
And I know popcorn. I'm the
second-best popcorn maker I know.

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.608
All right, I'll take the bait.
Who's the third-best?

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:54.684
I know, right? I've
always wondered that!

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.924
Shrub club!

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:00.846
Sorry!

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.571
It's just this game that I play
with my friends back home.

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:05.925
I love you!

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:07.766
What?

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:09.526
Um...

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:12.889
That's a direct quote,
from your dad.

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.401
"I love you."

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:15.761
His words.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.251
Hey, wait a second.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.249
How do I even know
that you know my dad?

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.402
You could be one of
those foreign guys
who always calls me up

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.090
and makes me get undressed
in front of the computer

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.764
because he lost
his passports and money.

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:26.524
No, no, that's not me.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.923
Look, I can prove it.

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.885
I have your cell phone.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.288
Oh, my gosh! No wonder no
one's been calling me!

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.481
Oh.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.000
I, uh, plugged
my number in there

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.523
in case you need me
late at night.

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:46.362
Oh, and we brought your box.
You left it at the house,
you stupid idiot.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.006
Hey, you wanna
see something neat?

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.286
Okay!

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:59.361
Wait, are you sure that it's okay
for birds to be eating Pop Rocks?

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:01.840
I mean, you'd think it would
be bad for their teeth.

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.323
Nah! That's just
a suburban legend.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.640
Oh.

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.441
Shit!

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:16.962
Spontaneous combustion,
however, totally real.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.081
Oh.

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.487
What?
<i>You gotta
get back here right now.</i>

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.011
One of those idiots
is in the building

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.923
and he's pretending
to be my husband!

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.208
Why don't you tell them
he's not your husband?

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:32.040
Because I don't even know
what they're up to.

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.289
He must be trying
to sell the box.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.648
Just get back here!

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:40.128
This microscopic robot,
or nanobot

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.170
can be injected
into the human body

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.449
to detect and cure cancer.

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.366
Interesting.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.764
Can it sing?

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:52.801
Uh...

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.161
What?

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.726
They got a large-mouth bass now
that you hang it on the wall.

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.644
When you walk past it,
it sings
Take Me to the River.

01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.841
Are you saying...
What I'm saying is,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.604
you're this close,

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.848
but there's a drawing board
you should be getting back to.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.126
Next!

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.728
But it cures cancer.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.486
<i>Ni</i> hao.

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:31.846
Listen to this.

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:34.008
"You will do important
things in the world."

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:35.527
That's so weird

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.325
because I actually want to do
important things in the world.

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.402
Wow. That's neat.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.207
Someday, I wanna do
important things, too.

01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:44.481
Oh, yeah? Like what?

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.928
I'm thinking about
getting new speakers.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.365
Oh.

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.850
I've always wanted
to go to India

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.491
and volunteer at one of
those leprechaun colonies.

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.364
I think you mean Ireland.

01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:59.126
Oh.

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.049
So what does
your cookie say?

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.843
"You will have
an amazing romance

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:07.526
"with the person sitted
across from you."

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:11.648
It's a good thing
I'm not your uncle.

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:14.007
"And don't be concerned
about the age difference.

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.169
"Just shut up
and make out.

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:19.005
"It will all sort itself
out later. You'll see!"

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.681
That's ridiculously specific.
Let me see that.

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.402
If you don't eat it,
it doesn't come true.

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.086
Hey, where's my dad?

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.645
Do you know if
Adele came with him?

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.280
She's probably the one
slowing him down.

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:34.891
Adele?

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:36.201
His wife.

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:38.286
Harry doesn't have a wife.

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.931
Who's Harry?

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:41.681
Your father.

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:42.966
My father's
name's not Harry.

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.040
It's Bernard.

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:46.048
Oh, yeah, but I'm talking
about your real dad.

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.686
Harry Dunne!

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:50.286
The guy who abandoned you when
you were a little, tiny baby.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.926
You're gonna love him!

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.886
Wait a second.

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.805
So you're saying we're
supposed to be meeting

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:57.245
my biographical father?

01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:58.767
Yes.

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.121
Here.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.609
This is a letter from
your real mother, Fraida,
that you sent back to her.

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:04.886
Nice.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.570
"Do not contact again."

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:08.640
This isn't my handwriting.

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:10.563
I don't even know cursive.

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.084
"Dear daughter, I gave you
up for adoption 18 years ago

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:18.242
"because I thought it was
the right thing to do.

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.641
"I hope and pray I made
the correct decision.

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:23.406
"You were conceived in Rhode
Island on a chilly autumn night

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:25.642
"in the parking lot
at Oyster Swallow Cove.

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:28.604
"We were young and stupid,
especially him."

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:30.125
Oyster Swallow Cove?

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.370
Are you ready, baby?

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.086
Mmm-hmm.

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:45.361
Whoa! Whoa!

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:46.846
Slow down.

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:48.285
Let's be responsible here.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.650
I brought some protection.

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.250
Let's do this.

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:04.360
"So, if you ever wanna get in
touch, I would love to meet you.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.610
"All my love, Fraida
Felcher, your mom."

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:11.290
That means I'm your...

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.641
And we almost...

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.643
Lloyd? Are you okay?

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.000
I'm sorry, Lloyd, but I gotta
get back to the convention.

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:22.964
I'm supposed to be giving a big
speech for my dad any minute.

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.644
But, wait. We have
so much to talk about.

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.721
It's an emergency!

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.007
It's all a big misunderstanding!
I've gotta go!

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.491
Not dressed
like that, you're not!

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:31.005
You're grounded!

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.166
Wait a minute.

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:38.004
If she's my kid,

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:41.168
then she's not
Harry's kid,

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.163
and he can't
take her kidneys.

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.485
What have I done?

01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:55.891
Hi, I need to get in.

01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:57.440
Credentials, please?

01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.045
Oh, I'm giving a speech.

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.324
Credentials, please.

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.601
What is that?

01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:05.286
Is it that thingy that they
gave me to get in here?

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:07.690
I think I've got
it here, somewhere.

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:11.731
Mister, l am appealing to your
sense of God and family.

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:13.121
I got a message
that my daughter,

01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:15.441
who I have not
seen in 22 years,

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:16.681
is in there.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.564
The event will be
letting out soon.

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:21.928
After 22 years,
what's another
couple of hours, right?

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.480
Okay, buddy.

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.763
There's got to be a, uh,

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:28.444
broom closet around
here somewhere, huh?

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:32.210
I'm sure we could
work something out.

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.929
I didn't take 34 years
to come out of the closet

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.405
just to go back into one

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.811
with you.

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:44.971
Okay, this device will give us a visual
rendering of your cognitive processes.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.480
Could you repeat the question?

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:50.280
This device will show us
what he's thinking

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:51.846
right on this screen.

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:54.525
Yeah, really.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.125
Go ahead,
Dr. Pinchelow.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.880
Think of a pleasant memory
from your childhood.

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.844
Okay-

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.161
Oh!

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:20.366
<i>Here, Biscuit!</i>

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.127
<i>Biscuit, come here, boy.</i>

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.286
<i>The door, buddy.
Get the door.</i>

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.411
Oh, okay.

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.962
No! This gadget
is way off!

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:42.805
First of all,
my bedspread was orange.

01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.330
Are you okay, honey?

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:00.851
No, not really.

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.326
Boyfriend trouble?

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:04.602
No. I need a ticket
to get in

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:07.445
and I lost the ticket that they
need to take, plus, I lost my pass.

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:08.567
And I thought
that I grabbed it,

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:09.641
but when I looked
in my purse,

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:11.563
all I saw was
the toothbrush.
So maybe I took...

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.051
Okay, okay, okay-

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.481
All right.

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.241
What's going on?

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.687
My father's supposed to be
getting a huge reward,

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:21.400
and I'm supposed to be
making the speech,

01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:23.050
and the speech is supposed
to start right now,

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:25.280
and there's no way they'll
let me in without a ticket.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.491
Oh, honey.

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.926
There is always a way.

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.009
I admit,
it's thought-provoking.

01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.288
An invention that
ends world hunger.

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.601
But, have you
considered this,

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.490
where does all
the extra poop go?

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:45.841
What? No.

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.410
The point is that
there's no more hunger.

01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.487
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:49.846
We're gonna take
a very brief break.

01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:50.967
Uh, please stay
in your seats

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:53.008
and we will resume,
uh, shortly.

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:54.167
Why?

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.571
We're gonna have
to take a walk.

01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:57.245
Come on.
I'm judging.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:58.725
You're out of here.
Okay!

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.080
You're out.

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:01.361
Mrs. P,

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.521
what are you
doing here?

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.729
Do you always
call your wife
Mrs. P?

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.691
Oh, uh...

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:10.803
How you doing, sugar tits?
I missed you.

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.530
This man is a fraud.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.722
And that box belongs
to my husband.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.087
He stole it from us.

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:17.247
Hand it over, buddy.

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:19.687
Uh-uh. I swore I'd only
give this box to Penny.

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.762
Give me the box!
Here you go.

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.960
- What's happening?
- I have no idea.

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:30.287
Hey!

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.402
Hey, hey!
Get back here!

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.245
Out of my way!

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.244
Thanks a lot, lady!

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.165
It's the least I could do.

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.243
There's something
I need to tell you.

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:51.771
You're my...

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:55.525
Okay. The reason
I'm here is...

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:56.687
Fraida!

01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.325
Harry?

01:28:58.440 --> 01:28:59.680
You made it!
Oh!

01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.010
Oh, and you found Penny.

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:05.928
Hey, how do you
know my...

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.287
Oh! You're Harry?

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:10.362
Yes! And I'm your mother!

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:14.804
He's got a gun!

01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:10.685
Why you standing
in the toilet?

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:12.845
So you wouldn't
see my feet.

01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:14.925
Why not just
stand on the rim?

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:17.008
There's ball hairs
all over that thing.

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:18.206
I'm not stupid.

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.844
Get out of there!
Move it!

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:23.560
Now!

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:26.249
Please don't hurt Penny,
Mrs. P.

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:29.563
She's young and still has most
of her future ahead of her.

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:31.011
Get the box.

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:36.210
Harry! There you are!

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:39.206
Good thing you're loud.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.525
What are you
doing, Mrs. P?

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:42.761
I'm about to kill you.

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.690
Wait, wait, wait!

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.531
Can't you kill
someone else?

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:48.045
My daughter, Penny,
needs me now.

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:50.560
What are you
talking about, Lloyd?
Penny's my daughter.

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.564
No, Harry, she isn't.
Mmm-mmm.

01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:53.881
What?

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:56.122
Why would you think
that she's your daughter?

01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:58.728
Because of the postcard.

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.726
I was about to be a single
mom and I needed money.

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:03.405
And you owed me 40 bucks

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:06.285
from that stupid
worm farm loan.

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:08.645
It's true, Har.

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.847
I'm the deadbeat dad,
not you.

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:14.804
I'm Penny's baby-papa.

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.084
But don't judge me
till you see this.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:21.290
Oh, yeah, like a cooler
of cold brewskies

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.010
is gonna make
everything okay!

01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:24.770
It's not beer,
it's my kidney!

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:29.566
Your kidney?

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:31.766
I figured

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:35.241
since you can't
get one from Penny,

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.411
I'd give it to you myself.

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:39.451
Holy shit.

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.091
How did you get this?

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:45.086
I crossed the border
into Mexico.

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:48.808
Turns out, the medical regs are
a little more chill down there.

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.890
Pardon me for bringing this
up, but I don't give a shit!

01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:55.169
Yeah, but, Lloyd, she isn't
your daughter either.

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:57.569
Nice try, Fraida,

01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.722
but Penny
read me the letter.

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:02.007
I know all about
Oyster Swallow Cove,

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:03.920
which is exactly where
you took me in the van!

01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:05.041
So?

01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:07.043
That was my spot.

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:10.205
I must have taken
hundreds of guys there.

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.361
What can I say?

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:15.449
I was a titanic whore.

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:17.804
That's enough bullshit.

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.804
Go ahead, Lippincott,
kill them.

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:22.121
Oh, I will.

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.491
But first, why don't
you join them.

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:26.687
What?

01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.484
You heard me.
Drop it!

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:30.210
Get over there!
Get over there!

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:32.681
You're kidding.
She's on our team now?

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:34.766
Don't do this, Lippincott.

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:35.966
You're a military man.

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:38.129
I know you've got
more integrity than this!

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.326
What is this?

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:43.561
Huh?

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.371
Two cupcakes?

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:47.520
Actually, there were
four cupcakes, sir.

01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:49.803
I ate the two chocolate ones.
Lloyd!

01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:52.167
It's okay. I left the
vanilla ones for humanity.

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:53.810
Where's the invention?

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:56.800
Where's the goddamn
billion-dollar invention?

01:32:58.040 --> 01:32:59.883
Put the gun down!
Freeze!

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.684
Put the gun down,
Lippincott!

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.729
Well! Hello.

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:09.887
Dad!

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.810
Bernard. Oh, thank
God you're here.

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.325
God, and you're okay!

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:15.851
Stop right there.

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:16.967
What?

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:18.405
I appreciate
your concern, Adele,

01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:20.323
but it's a little
late for that.

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:21.561
You see...

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:22.680
I couldn't stop wondering

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:25.007
why every time
I ate your cooking,
I was getting sicker.

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.725
And then when Harry
and Lloyd showed me

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.240
the letter from
Penny's birth mother,

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:29.845
I recognized that
the handwriting

01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:31.809
sending it back
was yours.

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:33.724
And the cruelty of this
got me to thinking.

01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:37.881
So l laid a little trap,
and lo and behold,
you took the bait

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:40.008
like the toe-sucking
rat that you are.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.161
After you left for El Paso,

01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:44.686
I called the FBI to make
sure Penny was protected.

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.047
I thought those Canadian
accents were a little shaky.

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:49.049
Yeah? You try it.

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:51.370
But what about
the invention?

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.848
It was just cupcakes.

01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:56.208
A gift for
Dr. Barbara Walcott

01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:58.169
for my having canceled
at the last moment.

01:33:58.240 --> 01:33:59.526
This is great, Dad!

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:02.410
Now you can pick up
your Lifetime Achievement
reward in person!

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:04.727
It's "award,"
you stupid bitch!

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:06.287
No!

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.289
Break it up! Get off!

01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:18.448
Hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back.

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:20.801
I'm the good guy here!
All right.

01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.769
Are you okay, Har?

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:25.246
I think so.

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:33.561
Oh, yeah,
it's just a little graze.

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:36.082
Uh, Har?

01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:38.686
You might wanna put
a dab of Bactine on that.

01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:43.606
Hurry, he's been shot!

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:44.681
We need a trauma room.

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:46.444
You're gonna be okay.
What have we got?

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:48.483
Gunshot wound,
left shoulder.

01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:50.200
Lloyd, the kidney!

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:51.406
Kidney?

01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:52.606
Oh, yeah.

01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:54.762
Would you, by any chance,
have time this evening

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.365
to swap out a kidney?

01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.249
I'm sorry, sir.
What is this?

01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:00.768
It's a kidney.
My kidney.

01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:02.730
It's for him,

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:04.888
my best pal.
Ah!

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:05.961
He needs it.

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:09.687
Gentlemen,
this is not a kidney.

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:11.680
What is it?

01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:13.849
- Better not be my heart.
- No.

01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:17.126
I believe it's a pork chop.

01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:19.005
In a baggie.

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:23.527
I wondered why my
kidney had grill marks.

01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:25.764
And a bone.

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:27.646
Hey, wait.

01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:30.201
Does that mean I still
have all my kidneys?

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.161
Let's have a look.

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:34.081
Ah.

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:36.970
I'm going to say
probably not.

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:39.801
That's it.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.526
I am gonna give
that quack an earful

01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:45.001
at my follow-up
appointment next Tuesday.

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.163
I'm sorry, Harry.

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:50.044
I failed you again!

01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:53.450
It's okay, Lloyd.

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.682
I forgive you.

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:00.171
What's so funny?

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.171
Got ya!

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:06.408
I never needed a kidney!

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:10.361
What?

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.682
Oh, you should have seen
the look on your face!

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:15.201
I got you so good!

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:18.205
Wait a minute.

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:19.725
You mean,

01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:22.929
I had my kidney removed

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.641
in the backseat
of a Toyota Tercel

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.162
and you were faking?
Uh-huh.

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.484
That is awesome!

01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.690
That is a good one.

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.364
Totally worth it!

01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:43.002
Gentlemen, I hate to break
up this Mensa summit,

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:44.650
but we've gotta get this
man's shoulder cleaned out.

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:46.040
Do you remember,
you've been shot?

01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.688
That was a good
gag, Harry.

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:52.367
But don't you think it still
would have been funny

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:55.928
if you had told me you were kidding
before I lost my vital organ?

01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:58.811
Oh, definitely.
But not as!

01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:05.210
That's true.

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.523
You guys are so cool.

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.967
How can I ever thank you
for what you did for me?

01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:23.605
Got any cash?

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.160
Oh, yeah.

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:26.446
I think
I've got a couple...

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:28.041
Thanks.

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:30.045
Score.

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:39.646
Oh, uh...

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.811
I'm sure those janitors
will thank us later. Mmm.

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:45.040
We were just straightening
up their broom closet.

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:46.691
Penny,
wonderful news!

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:50.283
Your father has invited me to
come stay with you for a while,

01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:52.602
so we can really get
to know each other.

01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:54.530
That's fantastic!

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.123
So let me ask you
something, Fraida.

01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.284
If I'm not Penny's father
and Lloyd's not her father,

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.050
then who's her father?

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:03.925
Funny you should ask.

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.406
Honey,

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:08.564
how would you like to
meet some relatives?

01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.770
Mr. Stainer?

01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:15.566
Oh, I should have known.

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:17.882
You horny, old goat!

01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:19.610
No, Lloyd!

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:22.640
Mr. Stainer is
Penny's grandfather.

01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.131
Come on.

01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:29.562
So, you mean
Pee-Stain is the dad?

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:31.800
Duh!

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:39.925
Hi!

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.161
Oh...

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:43.604
She's beautiful!

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:45.844
Sweet Jesus,
look at her.

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.410
She's got Peter's eyes.

01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:49.481
You're kidding!

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:51.170
He donated them?

01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:53.520
Hi, Pee-Stain!

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:55.125
Stainy!

01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:57.921
Hey, sorry
you got killed!

01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:01.684
Let's get you away
from these guys, huh?
Let's go.

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:03.046
Yeah.

01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:08.127
Guys, there's still one
thing I don't understand.

01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:12.446
How could either of you
have possibly thought

01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:14.443
that you were
Penny's father?

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:17.521
Why wouldn't we?
Yeah!

01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:19.530
Because we never had sex.

01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:21.046
Oh.

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:27.044
You could have fooled us.

01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:28.650
Yeah, nice try,
Snow White.

01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:31.200
Does the word "hot tub"
jog your memory?

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:32.447
If I recall,

01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:34.807
I played with your boobies
for a long time that night.

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:35.961
The motor boat,

01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:37.246
the windshield wipers,

01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:38.560
the punching bag.

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:39.801
You know, Harry,

01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:42.884
you can't get a woman pregnant
by man-handling her breasts.

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:44.081
Oh, really?

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:46.561
Then why did your
doorbells get so hard?

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:49.167
Yeah. And did you forget
about the French tickler,

01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:50.480
in the back of the van?

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:54.326
Putting a frilly,
glow-in-the-dark
condom on your finger

01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:56.402
is not the same
as having sex.

01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:57.641
But what if
I go like this?

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:00.407
No.

01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:03.882
Okay, Dr. Picasso, what's
your definition of sex?

01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:10.251
No way!

01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:11.760
That's just...

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:13.206
Not my mom!

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:14.600
But that's where
she pees!

01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:17.923
It's in my head
and I can't unlearn it!

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.605
You're bad!

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:20.761
Can you show us?

01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:22.444
I call sloppy seconds!

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:29.410
Looks like everyone else
ended up with someone.

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:31.041
Yep-

01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:32.531
And I got this pork chop.

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:35.730
So let me get
this straight, Har.

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:38.606
When you visited me in the
nuthouse the last time...

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:40.240
Uh-huh... you knew
about Penny already?

01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:42.521
No, I found out about her
when we visited my parents.

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:45.450
But I had finally figured
out that you were faking.

01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:47.051
Really? How?
Mmm-hmm.

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:48.121
What gave it away?

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:50.891
A few months ago,
I was changing your
diaper before bedtime

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:53.964
and you just seemed
a little too upbeat.

01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:57.131
Lloyd,

01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:59.402
even though
it's Christmas Eve,

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:02.570
I want you to know
that there's no place
I would rather be

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:05.564
than right here, wiping
my best friend's dookie.

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:08.681
Oh.

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:11.121
Looks like we got
another stocking stuffer.

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:16.770
I remember that.

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:19.606
That was the night
I had all that eggnog
and lamb, right?

01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:20.847
Yeah. Whoa!

01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:22.401
Lloyd!

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.401
Check out the hotties
at 12 o'clock.

01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:30.410
That's almost
three hours away.

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:32.170
Can't I check
them out now?

01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:41.921
Okay, Lloyd,

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.083
This time we're not gonna be
stupid and pass up a sure thing.

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:46.645
I hear you, Har.

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:49.124
We'll never get
another chance like this.

01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:51.521
Our time
has finally come.

01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:00.485
Bush club!

01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:47.601
Oh, crap!

01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:50.526
I ordered a vanilla shake and
they gave me a chocolate one.

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:52.568
Tell me about it. I ordered
a chocolate shake.

01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:54.529
Those dopes gave me
a vanilla one.

01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:56.290
They do that a lot.

01:48:58.440 --> 01:48:59.771
What the hell?

01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:03.250
Kick his ass, Seabass!

01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:05.240
Arr, the dirty
sons-of-bitches!

01:49:06.305 --> 01:49:12.939
