I'm bored.

01:04.605 --> 01:06.240
Ladi, I am at a loss.

01:06.307 --> 01:08.158
Brittany, please remind me

01:08.243 --> 01:10.477
of how I single-handedly
put cheerleading on the map.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.313
In 1979, you directed
a made-for-TV movie

01:13.364 --> 01:15.082
about the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders

01:15.149 --> 01:17.134
<i>called The Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders.</i>

01:17.202 --> 01:18.318
That is correct.

01:18.369 --> 01:20.320
And in the meantime, what's changed?

01:20.371 --> 01:21.988
Personal grooming habits?

01:22.040 --> 01:24.708
What's changed is I have
completely lost interest.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.511
And ladies, I blame you.

01:27.595 --> 01:28.896
Becky- more
silicone falsies.

01:28.963 --> 01:30.931
Got it, Coach.

01:30.999 --> 01:32.432
You will each enhance your
bust with an additional

01:32.500 --> 01:33.550
pair of chicken cutlets,

01:33.635 --> 01:35.219
in an attempt to add some jiggle

01:35.303 --> 01:39.323
to what is the most boring
routine I have ever witnessed.

01:39.390 --> 01:42.342
But Coach Sylvester, this
is the most elaborate routine

01:42.393 --> 01:43.427
the Cheerios! have ever done.

01:43.495 --> 01:44.895
We're shoo-ins at Regionals next week,

01:44.979 --> 01:46.630
and we're the favorite
to win at Nationals.

01:46.698 --> 01:50.450
And yet I am still so very bored.

01:50.518 --> 01:54.738
Even things I used to
think were hilarious...

01:54.823 --> 01:56.323
Case in point.

01:56.374 --> 01:59.042
Sandbags, slap yourself
with a chicken cutlet.

02:00.962 --> 02:02.963
Now slap Brittany.

02:03.030 --> 02:05.048
See? Not even a chuckle.

02:05.133 --> 02:06.667
The problem is you keep trying

02:06.718 --> 02:07.751
to make a bigger and bigger spectacle.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.836
No matter how hard we try,

02:09.888 --> 02:11.705
we can't make a routine
work unless you find a way

02:11.756 --> 02:13.307
to make it interesting for you.

02:13.374 --> 02:15.492
You have to find a way to top yourself.

02:15.560 --> 02:18.011
Q, you just may have a point.

02:18.062 --> 02:22.499
But to be sure, slap yourself
with a chicken cutlet.

02:33.394 --> 02:35.562
All right, I just want to take a minute

02:35.613 --> 02:37.915
to tell you guys how proud of you I am.

02:37.999 --> 02:39.900
We didn't even have to win this game

02:39.951 --> 02:42.586
to go to championship next
week, but nobody took it off.

02:42.670 --> 02:45.038
When we take a knee, we're
gonna finish first in conference

02:45.089 --> 02:46.373
for the first time in McKinley history.

02:46.424 --> 02:48.091
Football is back, bitches!

02:49.711 --> 02:51.745
Maybe we should all break
out into a song after we win.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.747
Hey, shut it, Karofsky. No fricking way.

02:53.798 --> 02:55.849
I figure if I stay on
you, you'll run away

02:55.917 --> 02:56.850
like your little butt buddy Hummel.

02:56.918 --> 02:58.268
That's funny, Karofsky,

02:58.353 --> 02:59.920
how you're calling
everybody gay all the time,

02:59.971 --> 03:01.438
but you never seem to have a girlfriend.

03:03.608 --> 03:06.310
It's okay. It's okay.

03:06.394 --> 03:07.945
I really hope that linebacker
doesn't get the jump on me.

03:08.029 --> 03:11.097
I bet it would hurt like
hell to get sacked by him.

03:15.119 --> 03:16.153
Break! TEAM: Break!

03:18.105 --> 03:19.623
All right.

03:19.707 --> 03:21.708
Slow left on one.

03:21.776 --> 03:23.493
Ready? Break! TEAM: Break!

03:23.578 --> 03:25.212

Whoo!

03:43.648 --> 03:45.098
(growlin

03:45.149 --> 03:46.600
Hut!

03:56.244 --> 03:58.812
Nice hands.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.451
What a joke.

04:04.502 --> 04:06.003
What the hell happened?!

04:06.087 --> 04:07.621
Finn, you're the captain, talk!

04:07.672 --> 04:09.155
Karofsky sucks, that's what happened!

04:09.207 --> 04:11.258
That's crap! Hudson's a frickin' girl

04:11.325 --> 04:13.460
and couldn't take a joke
about his precious Glee Club.

04:13.511 --> 04:15.462
Because I'm sick of you guys
getting down on us for it.

04:15.513 --> 04:17.329
We're in Glee Club. What's the big deal?

04:17.382 --> 04:19.499
It's embarrassing! We're dudes!

04:19.550 --> 04:20.817
Getting all hot and bothered

04:20.885 --> 04:23.670
about singing a Ke$ha
song? It's freakin' weird.

04:23.721 --> 04:24.855
Yeah? Well, maybe
you'll think it's cooler

04:24.939 --> 04:26.139
when I go all TiK ToK on your face.

04:26.190 --> 04:27.274
Bring it, Puckerman.

04:30.895 --> 04:33.179
That's enough! That's enough!

04:33.231 --> 04:36.116
Championship game or not,
I am not blocking for him.

04:37.351 --> 04:38.402
Get the hell out of here!

04:38.486 --> 04:39.486
Fine! Go!

04:39.537 --> 04:41.154
Good! Bunch of babies!

04:45.043 --> 04:48.095
<i>Dear Journal, I am in crisis.</i>

04:48.162 --> 04:49.880
<i>Not even the can't-lose combination</i>

04:49.947 --> 04:52.699
<i>of boobs and fire can
get me going anymore.</i>

04:52.750 --> 04:55.302
<i>Is it the raccoon hormones
my new doctor gave me?</i>

04:55.369 --> 04:56.887
<i>Maybe.</i>

04:56.971 --> 05:00.223
<i>Here I am, 31, and already a legend.</i>

05:00.308 --> 05:03.226
<i>What do I do as a second act?</i>

05:03.311 --> 05:05.762
<i>I'm simply at a loss. Last week,</i>

05:05.847 --> 05:08.849
<i>I even took to modifying
my own flawless form</i>

05:08.900 --> 05:10.901
<i>just to feel something. Wait.</i>

05:10.985 --> 05:14.821
It's Syv-lester,
right? Sue Syv-lester?

05:14.889 --> 05:16.556
<i>How do I make things interesting again?</i>

05:16.607 --> 05:19.659
<i>How do I get those juices flowing?</i>

05:30.371 --> 05:31.204
That's it.

05:37.411 --> 05:41.765
This here is the A950.

05:41.849 --> 05:44.434
You say this could shoot
someone across a football field?

05:44.519 --> 05:48.271
Several football fields, if
you pack in enough explosives.

05:48.356 --> 05:52.192
Of course, that would
be incredibly unsafe.

05:52.259 --> 05:55.095
See, if you want to go for
more than, say, 50 yards,

05:55.146 --> 05:58.598
you're looking about a 70% chance

05:58.649 --> 06:00.817
of catastrophic failure.

06:00.902 --> 06:05.038
Which is a 30% chance
of catastrophic success.

06:05.106 --> 06:06.873
This is the button,
right? No, no, no, no!

06:18.836 --> 06:20.470
You know, I try to make it a habit

06:20.555 --> 06:23.173
of not touching carny folk, but fella...

06:23.257 --> 06:24.391
I'll take it.

06:24.458 --> 06:25.842
You got a smaller one?

06:25.927 --> 06:27.844
I'll check stock.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.964
I'm back.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.349
So I was going through my bucket list

06:32.433 --> 06:33.850
and I noticed you were
the only Glee loser

06:33.935 --> 06:35.735
that I haven't slushied yet.

06:35.803 --> 06:36.903
Damn near broke his heart.

06:36.971 --> 06:38.271
Well, what about the moral implications

06:38.322 --> 06:39.639
of abusing a kid in a wheelchair?

06:39.690 --> 06:40.857
I say, equal opportunity for all.

06:49.083 --> 06:50.534
This stuff between the
jocks and the Glee Club

06:50.618 --> 06:52.702
has been going on since I
started running the club.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.504
Maybe.

06:54.589 --> 06:56.790
It just seems like it's
so much worse right now.

06:56.841 --> 06:59.960
I've won division championships
at three different schools.

07:00.011 --> 07:02.546
You have to understand
what winning means

07:02.630 --> 07:03.680
to a community. Grades go up,

07:03.764 --> 07:06.833
the streets are
cleaner, crime goes down.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.186
It's a sense of pride, of unity.

07:09.270 --> 07:11.138
And this school deserves that.

07:11.189 --> 07:12.806
And you are going to get it for us.

07:12.857 --> 07:14.841
I mean, you won almost
every game this year.

07:14.892 --> 07:16.226
Winning conference was easy.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.812
The team we're up
against for championship-

07:18.863 --> 07:20.197
they're much better than us.

07:20.281 --> 07:23.016
If you don't have thtalent,
you re on the chemistry.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.451
They don't have to like each other,

07:24.518 --> 07:26.369
but they have to respect each other.

07:26.454 --> 07:28.004
This whole thing is just so weird.

07:28.089 --> 07:29.956
I mean, half of your
starters are in my Glee Club.

07:30.007 --> 07:31.441
I just don't know what to do.

07:32.810 --> 07:34.094
Do you trust me?

07:34.145 --> 07:36.062
You're not going to try
and kiss me again, are you?

07:36.130 --> 07:38.181
If you trust me,

07:38.266 --> 07:41.518
I think I know a way to
get your team united again.

07:41.602 --> 07:42.519
Really fast.

07:42.603 --> 07:44.321
Oh, my
God- Artie!

07:45.323 --> 07:47.107
It was awful.

07:47.158 --> 07:48.191
That's it! Screw rehearsal!

07:48.276 --> 07:50.443
This ends here and now.

07:50.494 --> 07:52.829
We're gonna go all
Thunderdome on those guys.

07:52.914 --> 07:56.533
So this is what the ladies
lounge looks like on the inside.

07:56.617 --> 07:57.951
This is the choir room.
Now, put up your fists

07:58.002 --> 07:58.952
because you and I are
going to do some dancing.

07:59.003 --> 08:01.004
No, I got this, Sam.

08:01.088 --> 08:02.756
Coach Beiste told us
to come. Where is she?

08:02.823 --> 08:05.491
Watch it. Everyone, have a seat.

08:05.543 --> 08:06.626
You, too, guys.

08:06.677 --> 08:08.494
All right, New Directions!,

08:08.546 --> 08:11.131
let's give a warm welcome to
the newest members of Glee Club.

08:12.499 --> 08:14.050
Oh, hell to the no, Mr. Shue.

08:14.135 --> 08:15.936
Hey! Come on!

08:16.003 --> 08:17.470
Guys! Hey!

08:17.521 --> 08:18.855
Are you serious? These are the
guys that made Kurt transfer.

08:18.940 --> 08:20.640
And there's no way that
I'm sharing the choir room

08:20.691 --> 08:22.025
with a known homophobe.

08:22.109 --> 08:23.894
I don't disagree with you guys.

08:23.978 --> 08:25.362
But I talked to Coach Beiste about it,

08:25.446 --> 08:27.981
and she and I both agreed
that the kind of bullying

08:28.032 --> 08:29.449
that David does is
born out of ignorance.

08:29.516 --> 08:32.452
Having him in here, as
difficult as it may be for us,

08:32.519 --> 08:35.739
is an opportunity to show
him and the rest of the guys

08:35.823 --> 08:37.039
that being in Glee
Club is kind of cool-

08:37.124 --> 08:40.043
find some common ground.

08:40.126 --> 08:41.527
All of you are going to be in
this Glee Club for one week,

08:41.578 --> 08:43.046
no exceptions.

08:43.130 --> 08:45.465
She's bluffing- next week
is the championship game.

08:45.532 --> 08:46.666
Without us, shhas no team.

08:46.717 --> 08:48.251
With you, I have no team!

08:48.336 --> 08:50.670
You guys have gotta find
a way to come together

08:50.721 --> 08:52.555
or we're going to get
our asses kicked from here

08:52.640 --> 08:54.507
until Tuesday finds a
saddlebag full of buckwheat.

08:57.261 --> 08:59.379
If I have to stay, I'm
not singing no show tunes.

08:59.430 --> 09:00.981
That is the music of my oppressors.

09:01.048 --> 09:02.933
Do you even have any
idea what we do in here?

09:03.017 --> 09:04.768
No. None of them do.

09:04.852 --> 09:06.653
We have to show them.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.355
Rachel, Puck, haven't you
guys been working on something?

09:08.406 --> 09:09.823
Why don't you give it a whirl?

09:09.890 --> 09:12.409
Fine. As offended as I
am by their presence here,

09:12.493 --> 09:14.494
I won't let anything get
in the way of a performance.

11:58.492 --> 12:00.276
Great first day, right?

12:00.361 --> 12:01.428
Awesome.

12:01.495 --> 12:02.395
Let me at that guy!

12:07.039 --> 12:09.874
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:09.959 --> 12:11.960
We used to be best friends...

12:12.027 --> 12:13.694
before I got your girlfriend pregnant,

12:13.746 --> 12:15.997
and then made out with
your other girlfriend and...

12:16.048 --> 12:17.532
Yeah.

12:17.583 --> 12:20.168
Anyways... I gotta be honest.

12:20.219 --> 12:22.387
I really want to win this game,
and I figure it's the only way

12:22.471 --> 12:25.223
us Glee studs are ever gonna
get any respect around here.

12:25.307 --> 12:26.558
What's your point?

12:26.625 --> 12:28.943
My point is that none
of that's gonna happen

12:29.011 --> 12:31.396
unless you and I become
allies again, like

12:31.480 --> 12:33.314
<i>Maverick and Iceman
at the end of Top Gun.</i>

12:33.382 --> 12:36.551
So why'd youing that duet with Rachel?

12:36.602 --> 12:40.655
I need you to do this number
with me to make Finn jealous.

12:40.723 --> 12:43.024
Nothing like that
will ever happen again.

12:43.075 --> 12:45.159
You lead, and I got your back.

12:45.227 --> 12:47.245
We need to win this
championship and become legends.

12:51.750 --> 12:55.236
Ladies, my "Sue-clear" Weapon.

12:55.287 --> 12:56.671
Becky.

13:00.593 --> 13:02.594
Brittany...

13:02.678 --> 13:03.911
Climb on up.

13:03.963 --> 13:05.346
Congratulations.

13:05.414 --> 13:08.550
You're doing this stunt
for the big competition.

13:08.601 --> 13:12.103
I don't want to die yet.

13:12.187 --> 13:14.022
<i>At least not until One
Tree Hill gets cancelled.</i>

13:14.089 --> 13:15.890
Fine.

13:15.941 --> 13:19.527
To put your toddler, fist-sized
mind at ease, we'll do one

13:19.595 --> 13:21.112
final test run.

13:36.996 --> 13:37.945
Any of you take German?

13:37.997 --> 13:39.780
I may have to read

13:39.832 --> 13:42.133
the owner's manual.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.788
Don't worry, I'll talk to Mr.
Shue and take care of this.

13:49.124 --> 13:50.975
Sue, what the hell were you thinking?

13:51.060 --> 13:53.962
You cannot perform a
stunt that dangerous!

13:54.029 --> 13:56.431
Our insurance premium is
through the roof as it is!

13:56.482 --> 13:58.016
Cheerleading is a sport.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.734
There are dangers involved.

13:59.801 --> 14:01.436
The same as when a quarterback

14:01.487 --> 14:03.237
is sacked, or a hockey player is

14:03.305 --> 14:04.572
slammed up against the boards.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.107
Enough, Sue.

14:06.158 --> 14:08.142
There is no excuse for putting
a student's life at risk.

14:08.193 --> 14:10.295
I'm a tastemaker, Will.

14:10.362 --> 14:11.913
I know what an audience wants.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.931
You are not going to
take this away from me.

14:13.999 --> 14:15.533
I need this.

14:15.618 --> 14:19.087
This level of risk and danger
makes me feel alive again.

14:19.154 --> 14:20.922
But the risk and danger isn't to you!

14:20.989 --> 14:22.323
That's the best part.

14:22.374 --> 14:24.425
Enough! It's decided.

14:24.493 --> 14:26.344
You are not allowed to fire yone

14:26.428 --> 14:28.162
out of that cannon
without their consent!

14:35.437 --> 14:36.504
Huh.

14:45.847 --> 14:47.732
It's coming out of

14:47.816 --> 14:49.567
your paycheck-
every penny of it!

14:56.792 --> 14:59.043
Oh, God! It's a lawsuit.

14:59.128 --> 15:01.028
I'm telling you, I wish
you could have seen it.

15:09.871 --> 15:10.705
Sort of like that.

15:23.435 --> 15:25.553
What the hell are you doing?

15:25.604 --> 15:28.055
I'm seing a message.

15:28.107 --> 15:29.907
Sue Sylvester's done playing nice.

15:29.992 --> 15:34.278
I just got off the phone with
the Ohio Cheerleading Board,

15:34.363 --> 15:37.615
and they accepted my
request to move my regional

15:37.700 --> 15:40.067
to the same night as
your championship game.

15:40.119 --> 15:41.753
Congratulations.

15:41.820 --> 15:45.289
You just lost your halftime
show and the cheerleaders.

15:47.459 --> 15:49.544
Sue!

15:54.082 --> 15:55.916
What the crap are we gonna do now?

16:00.422 --> 16:02.923
I got it.

16:02.975 --> 16:04.392
No frickin' way! WILL:
We don't have a choice.

16:04.443 --> 16:06.527
Sue pulled the Cheerios! from the game,

16:06.595 --> 16:08.696
so if we don't do it,
there's no halftime show.

16:08.764 --> 16:10.114
And this is a problem because?

16:10.199 --> 16:12.266
It's not a problem. It's an opportunity.

16:12.317 --> 16:14.268
Opportunity to humiliate
ourselves. BEISTE: Hey!

16:14.319 --> 16:17.288
the whole point of this week
was to bring you guys together;

16:17.372 --> 16:18.939
to bring the school together.
Wait- so you want us

16:18.991 --> 16:21.826
to play the first half,
change into some "sequeen"

16:21.910 --> 16:23.661
ball gowns, and then

16:23.746 --> 16:26.748
go out and do the halftime show
at our own championship game?

16:26.799 --> 16:30.168
Yes. It's the championship game!

16:30.252 --> 16:31.753
This is a crazy town. Crazy.

16:31.804 --> 16:33.454
This is crazy! What about
the Cheerios! in Glee Club?

16:33.505 --> 16:34.889
They have a choice.

16:34.956 --> 16:36.758
Us, or the Cheerios! competition.

16:36.809 --> 16:39.977
Well, obviously, Quinn is gonna
choose the Cheerios! I mean...

16:40.062 --> 16:42.180
Well, that's not fair. You
don't know what she's goa.

16:42.264 --> 16:43.464
I think the
cheerleading competition

16:43.515 --> 16:45.149
is gonna be a lot of fun, but if you go,

16:45.234 --> 16:46.601
you're gonna miss out

16:46.652 --> 16:49.303
on us doing the most
iconic song of all time.

16:49.354 --> 16:52.306
The Super Bowl
of pop anthems-

16:52.357 --> 16:54.141
"Thriller. "

16:54.193 --> 16:56.077
Yeah!

16:56.144 --> 16:58.112
Yeah, remember a few years ago.

16:58.163 --> 16:59.797
when that Philippine prison did that

16:59.865 --> 17:01.799
mega performance of "Thriller"
and put it on YouTube?

17:01.867 --> 17:04.252
In the four months it took
to rehearse that number,

17:04.319 --> 17:06.337
prisoner-on-prisoner
crime dropped

17:06.421 --> 17:07.839
80%.

17:07.923 --> 17:10.708
Doing that, together, as a team,

17:10.792 --> 17:13.211
created a unity within that prison.

17:13.295 --> 17:15.346
And that's what I'm looking to do here.

17:15.430 --> 17:16.681
I mean, don't get
me wrong, you know-

17:16.765 --> 17:18.182
I'm big on Michael
and everything-

17:18.267 --> 17:20.501
but isn't that kind of what
they're expecting us to do

17:20.551 --> 17:22.220
Which is why we're
gonna mash it together

17:22.304 --> 17:24.171
with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs'
equally spooky single

17:24.223 --> 17:26.190
"Heads Will Roll. "

17:28.644 --> 17:29.610
Who's Yeah Yeah Yeah?

17:29.678 --> 17:30.945
All right, New Directions!, Titans,

17:31.012 --> 17:33.681
we're going to Zombie Camp.

17:37.520 --> 17:38.804
Uh, five, six, seven, eight.

17:46.562 --> 17:48.363
Time out.

17:48.448 --> 17:50.065
Time out. Time out.
Hey. Hey.

17:50.149 --> 17:51.149
Knock it off!

17:51.200 --> 17:52.200
Okay, guys.

17:52.285 --> 17:53.368
It's good, but let's...

17:53.453 --> 17:54.569
put a little life into it.

17:54.654 --> 17:55.954
But we're dead.

17:56.022 --> 17:58.040
Then put some afterlife into it.

17:58.124 --> 18:00.792
t out of your heads and get
into your aracters, all right?

18:02.161 --> 18:03.194
Very creative. I like that.

18:07.633 --> 18:09.034
Five, six, seven, eight.

18:15.725 --> 18:17.759
All right! Nice progress, guys.

18:17.844 --> 18:19.261
Now let's take a
breather, and I'll see you

18:19.345 --> 18:20.479
in the choir room in five minutes,

18:20.546 --> 18:21.763
for a lesson in zombie makeup.

18:21.848 --> 18:23.482
Makeup?!? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:23.549 --> 18:24.816
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

18:24.884 --> 18:26.234
Yes, yes, yes. Hey, Dave.

18:26.319 --> 18:28.270
Talk to you for a second?

18:28.354 --> 18:29.771
Look, I know I'm bad.

18:29.856 --> 18:32.657
Can you just spare me, so
can we get through this?

18:32.725 --> 18:35.027
That's not what I was
going to say at all.

18:35.078 --> 18:36.227
You're actually really good.

18:36.279 --> 18:37.829
If you took that energy

18:37.897 --> 18:40.231
you used bullying people
and put it into this,

18:40.283 --> 18:42.501
you'd be one of most
talented guys in the school.

18:42.568 --> 18:45.570
Just think about it.

18:51.761 --> 18:53.378
...makeup artist.

18:53.429 --> 18:55.847
I am brilliant.

18:55.915 --> 18:57.248
It's actually decent.

18:57.300 --> 18:59.267
It's all right.

19:03.523 --> 19:05.440
I took a makeup class.

19:05.525 --> 19:07.359
Hey, I need to talk to you.

19:07.426 --> 19:08.660
Can we not fight for just one day?

19:08.728 --> 19:10.095
Man, it's already hard enough

19:10.146 --> 19:12.064
not to kick you in the
nuts every time I see you.

19:12.115 --> 19:14.483
You think maybe we should do
a warm-up number or something

19:14.567 --> 19:17.903
before we do that big
"Thriller" thing at halftime?

19:17.954 --> 19:20.539
You know, I figure the only way
I'm gonna keep any street cred

19:20.606 --> 19:22.157
around here after dancing
around like an idiot

19:22.241 --> 19:24.709
in front of the whole school
is if we kick ass at it.

19:24.777 --> 19:26.711
Uh...

19:26.779 --> 19:28.713
yeah... couldn't agree more.

19:33.386 --> 19:35.303
Zombie camp was funner than I expected.

19:35.388 --> 19:37.389
And the glee club together
with the football team-

19:37.456 --> 19:39.391
it's like a double rainbow.

19:39.458 --> 19:40.892
A zombie double rainbow.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.177
What the hell are we gonna do?

19:42.261 --> 19:43.145
If we go to our
cheerleading competition,

19:43.229 --> 19:45.013
then we miss the halftime show,

19:45.098 --> 19:46.515
and we're out of Glee Club.

19:46.599 --> 19:48.066
I'm torn.

19:48.134 --> 19:50.235
Oh, I'm not. I'm
Brittany.

19:50.302 --> 19:53.138
Couldn't help but
overhear your conversation.

19:53.189 --> 19:54.573
What were you doing in there?

19:54.640 --> 19:56.458
Enjoying the eavesdropping afforded me

19:56.526 --> 19:58.443
by the Swiss-timepiece regularity

19:58.494 --> 19:59.644
and utter silence

19:59.695 --> 20:03.248
of my 2:00 p. m. ninja poops.

20:03.315 --> 20:06.651
Well, I typed these up for you ladies,

20:06.702 --> 20:08.703
requiring your signature,

20:08.788 --> 20:11.506
tendering your resignation
from the Glee Club.

20:11.591 --> 20:14.759
Oh, and Brittany, here's a note for you,

20:14.827 --> 20:17.462
handwritten and in crayon
from the Human Cannon,

20:17.513 --> 20:19.664
saying how much it misses you.

20:19.715 --> 20:21.183
Coach, that cannon is going
to get Brittany killed.

20:21.267 --> 20:22.434
Is that really worth it

20:22.501 --> 20:24.803
just to win a stupid
national champiohip?

20:24.854 --> 20:28.173
Seventh consecutive stupid
national championship.

20:28.224 --> 20:30.659
This is ridiculous. You had
quite a year last year, Q.

20:30.726 --> 20:32.861
And as I recall, you
didn't have such a good time

20:32.945 --> 20:35.346
out of that Cheerios! uniform.

20:35.398 --> 20:37.399
Ladies, I am giving you
the chance, right now,

20:37.483 --> 20:41.236
to choose once and for all
where your true loyalties lie.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.821
Choose the Cheerios!,

20:42.872 --> 20:46.391
or choose the Glee Club.

20:57.203 --> 20:58.887
How the hell could you do this?

20:58.971 --> 21:01.256
Oh, don't get all up in my face, Finn.

21:01.340 --> 21:02.924
What were we supposed to do?

21:03.009 --> 21:04.476
Uh, quit Cheerios!

21:04.543 --> 21:06.311
Coach Sylvester is awful to you guys.

21:06.378 --> 21:08.396
And don't forget who was there for you

21:08.481 --> 21:11.933
the last time she dumped you
on your ass- us, Glee Club.

21:12.018 --> 21:14.853
And you don't think that
I feel awful about that?

21:14.904 --> 21:16.554
You don't need to be
a Cheerio! to be cool.

21:16.606 --> 21:18.106
Oh, you are so naive.

21:18.191 --> 21:19.557
This whole school is about labels.

21:19.609 --> 21:22.194
Wow. I never realized
you were sfreakin' weak.

21:22.245 --> 21:24.446
Oh. I... What did you say?

21:24.530 --> 21:25.914
All the Cheerios! quit Glee
Club. So why are you yelling

21:25.998 --> 21:27.115
at my girlfriend about it?

21:27.200 --> 21:28.116
I'm yelling at her because

21:28.201 --> 21:29.367
I'm the leader of this team.

21:29.418 --> 21:30.902
Well, maybe it's time
for a chge at the top.

21:30.953 --> 21:33.088
What's that supposed to mean?
This is kind of hot, actually.

21:33.172 --> 21:34.673
It means that maybe the reason

21:34.740 --> 21:37.209
everyone hates us is because
we need some new leadership.

21:37.260 --> 21:39.544
Face it, you've had your feet
in both worlds for a year,

21:39.595 --> 21:41.263
and never been able
to bring them together.

21:41.347 --> 21:42.547
Maybe someone else could.

21:42.598 --> 21:44.516
What, as in maybe you? As in yes.

21:44.583 --> 21:45.884
Well, maybe we should
settle this right now.

21:45.935 --> 21:48.220
Bring it. Brung.

21:50.106 --> 21:51.556
Want some more of that? Huh? Yeah.

21:51.607 --> 21:53.058
You like that? Huh?
Really, guys? Really.

21:53.109 --> 21:55.644
Hey, hey! How many fights do
I have to break up this week?

21:55.728 --> 21:57.779
Now calm down...

21:57.863 --> 21:59.231
and get back to Glee Club.

21:59.282 --> 22:01.032
Come on.

22:02.568 --> 22:04.703
Hope to see you there.

Real good.

23:48.090 --> 23:50.675
Awesome!

23:50.726 --> 23:52.344
Seriously.

23:52.395 --> 23:54.679
All you football players
nailing that Zombies classic

23:54.730 --> 23:56.514
on the first time out.

23:56.565 --> 23:58.350
I am impressed.

24:09.195 --> 24:10.662
Appropriate outfits.

24:10.729 --> 24:11.996
They represent the death

24:12.064 --> 24:13.531
of your guyses' reign at this school.

24:13.582 --> 24:16.401
How many times do we have to
put you puckheads in your place

24:16.452 --> 24:19.170
before you realize that
football rules this school?

24:19.238 --> 24:21.589
Maybe, but not after you
make dancing fools of yourself

24:21.674 --> 24:22.707
at that halftime show.

24:22.758 --> 24:24.092
You know it,

24:24.210 --> 24:26.127
we know it, the whole school knows it.

24:26.212 --> 24:27.578
They'll think different
after they see it.

24:27.630 --> 24:28.963
It's going to be awesome.

24:29.031 --> 24:30.682
Holy crap. They turned Karofsky gay.

24:32.251 --> 24:33.718
What are you moose knuckles
doing with those Slushees?

24:33.769 --> 24:35.303
Ready for the fireworks?

24:35.388 --> 24:36.971
It's Independence Day.

24:38.274 --> 24:39.557
Oh, my eyes!

24:39.608 --> 24:40.925
It's burning!

24:40.976 --> 24:43.111
Just relax; it stops
after a couple hours

24:43.195 --> 24:45.596
No frickin' way I'm
letting that happen again.

24:45.648 --> 24:48.066
He's in the first stage
of loserdom: denial.

24:48.117 --> 24:50.235
No! I am not a loser.

24:50.286 --> 24:52.036
And I don't sing and dance.

24:52.104 --> 24:55.290
I walk tall d carra big stick.

24:55.374 --> 24:58.960
Dude, relax... this is gonna be fine.

24:59.044 --> 25:00.445
Yeah, of course it is.

25:00.496 --> 25:01.746
'Cause I'm quitting Glee Club.

25:01.797 --> 25:03.748
No, you're not. Fact is,

25:03.799 --> 25:05.750
covered in ice and red dye number seven,

25:05.801 --> 25:07.385
you guys look more like a team

25:07.453 --> 25:08.720
than you ever have out on the field.

25:08.787 --> 25:09.921
I don't care. I'm out.

25:09.972 --> 25:11.256
Then you're off the team.

25:11.307 --> 25:13.391
No way. Yeah.

25:13.459 --> 25:16.311
If we all quit, you barely have
enough guys to play next week.

25:16.395 --> 25:18.012
It's the championship game.

25:18.097 --> 25:19.130
You're not going to throw it away.

25:19.181 --> 25:21.683
Try me. FINN: Don't do this.

25:21.767 --> 25:23.318
If we stand together,

25:23.402 --> 25:25.186
and we do the halftime
show, we can win this game

25:25.271 --> 25:26.271
and be kings in this place.

25:29.808 --> 25:32.160
Good luck with that.

Me. Thank you very much.

28:22.696 --> 28:24.196
Now, I don't want to
sound cocky or anything,

28:24.248 --> 28:26.699
but you guys better be pulling
out all the stops for Regionals,

28:26.750 --> 28:29.219
because the number we just
rehearsed is so off-the-hook,

28:29.303 --> 28:30.386
it's dangerous.

28:30.471 --> 28:31.754
Seriously. People should wear

28:31.839 --> 28:32.839
protective headgear
when they're watching it.

28:34.508 --> 28:35.625
Guys, we're kidding.

28:35.693 --> 28:37.260
Yeah, well, it's just
hard to laugh right now

28:37.344 --> 28:38.428
with everything going on at McKinley.

28:38.512 --> 28:39.746
I mean, look at us,

28:39.813 --> 28:41.213
the stars of two rival show choirs

28:41.265 --> 28:43.433
sitting down to coffee-
our school is so messed up,

28:43.517 --> 28:45.068
we can't even keep our
own football team together.

28:45.152 --> 28:46.436
It's so sad, you guys.

28:46.520 --> 28:47.820
Coach Beiste and Mr. Shue were so close

28:47.888 --> 28:49.388
to getting everyone
at the school together.

28:49.440 --> 28:51.057
Why hasn't Finn told
me anything about this?

28:51.108 --> 28:52.408
I mean, we live together.

28:52.476 --> 28:54.444
mean, I bring him a glass
of warm milk every night,

28:54.528 --> 28:55.828
just in the hopes that we'll
have a little lady-chat.

28:55.896 --> 28:57.080
Warm milk? Really?

28:57.164 --> 28:58.164
It's delicious.

28:58.231 --> 28:59.899
Finn's too proud to complain.

28:59.967 --> 29:01.734
He feels like he has to
be strong for everyone,

29:01.785 --> 29:03.336
but I know it's just killing him inside.

29:03.403 --> 29:04.587
I hope he realizes

29:04.672 --> 29:06.339
that, you know, if he
and I were still together,

29:06.406 --> 29:07.840
I could make him feel
a lot better, you know.

29:07.908 --> 29:09.208
Let it go, Rachel.

29:09.260 --> 29:11.094
I...

29:11.178 --> 29:13.930
I just wish thathere was
a way that we could help.

29:13.998 --> 29:15.298
That's all. Yeah.

29:15.382 --> 29:16.349
And the worst part is
how bummed the guys are.

29:16.416 --> 29:17.467
I mean, they already suffer

29:17.551 --> 29:19.469
enough abuse just being in Glee.

29:19.553 --> 29:21.087
I really think winning
the game could have eased

29:21.138 --> 29:22.639
some of the pressure, at
least for a little while.

29:22.706 --> 29:24.274
Wait, so the whole team quit?

29:24.358 --> 29:25.758
Everybody not in Glee.

29:25.809 --> 29:27.259
I mean, you can't play
football with five guys.

29:27.311 --> 29:29.028
And one of them is in a wheelchair.

29:29.096 --> 29:30.262
Yeah, Coach Beiste
put up a sign-up sheet

29:30.314 --> 29:31.197
for people to join. I think they'll take

29:31.264 --> 29:32.231
anyone at this point.

29:32.283 --> 29:33.533
Well, the good news is,

29:33.600 --> 29:34.784
you actually only need four more guys.

29:34.868 --> 29:37.020
High school regulations actually let you

29:37.087 --> 29:39.405
play a couple guys
short, if you want to.

29:39.456 --> 29:42.108
But if they figure out
a way to make it work,

29:42.159 --> 29:43.409
you can bet that we'll
definitely be there

29:43.460 --> 29:44.961
to cheer them on. Totally.

29:45.045 --> 29:47.130
Blaine and I love football.

29:47.214 --> 29:48.798
Well, Blaine loves
football. I love scarves.

29:52.920 --> 29:55.454
I cut 30 guys when we had tryouts

29:55.506 --> 29:57.173
at the beginning of the season.

29:57.257 --> 29:59.892
You're telling me not one
of those guys wants to play?

29:59.960 --> 30:01.728
It's like crossing a picket line.

30:01.795 --> 30:03.563
Nobody wants to be a scab.

30:03.630 --> 30:05.765
I guess we should go break it to them.

30:05.816 --> 30:07.633
Why can't we just let them

30:07.685 --> 30:08.935
back on the team, just for this game?

30:08.986 --> 30:10.970
No. We carry this thing through,

30:11.021 --> 30:13.239
even if it means having
to forfeit the game.

30:13.306 --> 30:14.357
I can't believe this is it.

30:19.813 --> 30:21.164
Maybe it isn't.

30:25.986 --> 30:27.420
We want to join the team.

30:27.487 --> 30:29.622
"We," who?

30:29.673 --> 30:31.007
All us Glee girls.

30:31.091 --> 30:33.843
We want to join the football team,

30:33.927 --> 30:35.545
and we want to play in the championship.

30:35.612 --> 30:36.662
Come on, guys. Stop screwing around.

30:36.714 --> 30:37.930
It's not cool.

30:37.998 --> 30:39.465
What's not cool is you guys

30:39.516 --> 30:40.833
not respecting women enough to realize

30:40.884 --> 30:42.685
we're perfectly capable
of playing football.

30:42.803 --> 30:43.970
And don't forget who the state champ

30:44.021 --> 30:45.171
in Greco-Roman wrestling is.

30:45.222 --> 30:47.640
I've got offers from three different

30:47.691 --> 30:48.941
professional wrestling organizations

30:49.009 --> 30:50.943
for after I graduate, so...

30:51.011 --> 30:53.229
Rachel, have you actually
seen a tackle football game?

30:53.313 --> 30:55.031
When they tackle you, it hurts.

30:55.115 --> 30:56.649
Yeah. And not in the
good, Mellencamp way.

30:56.700 --> 30:57.867
We thought about that. But the truth is,

30:57.951 --> 30:59.769
is that you guys don't
really need us to play.

30:59.837 --> 31:00.853
You just need enough players

31:00.904 --> 31:02.321
out there to field a regulation team.

31:02.373 --> 31:03.523
So when they snap the ball,

31:03.590 --> 31:04.657
we're just going to
lie down on the ground.

31:04.708 --> 31:05.691
We're just going to lie there.

31:05.743 --> 31:07.210
Well, I'm not.

31:07.294 --> 31:08.461
I'm going to bring the pain.

31:08.528 --> 31:11.831
I guess they won't get
hurt if you stay down.

31:11.882 --> 31:14.217
Okay, what do your
parents have to say about this?

31:14.301 --> 31:16.135
We all have signed
permission slips from them.

31:16.203 --> 31:18.421
It took some convincing,
but they understood

31:18.505 --> 31:19.806
what it means to all of us.

31:19.873 --> 31:22.341
What do you think, Coach?

31:22.393 --> 31:23.543
I think...

31:25.929 --> 31:27.880
Welcome to the football team.

31:27.931 --> 31:29.015
Yes!

31:30.734 --> 31:32.602
Football team, football team.

31:32.686 --> 31:33.853
High five, teammate.

31:33.904 --> 31:35.888
I just don't want to die.

31:35.939 --> 31:37.389
You don't climb in that cannon,

31:37.441 --> 31:40.276
and that routine will be all
"boom boom," and no "pow. "

31:40.360 --> 31:44.747
And that, Brittany, is so 2000 and late.

31:44.832 --> 31:47.166
Here's your consent form.

31:47.234 --> 31:49.252
And as you ponder your decision,

31:49.336 --> 31:51.788
I ask that you remember that that cannon

31:51.872 --> 31:54.073
has two little baby
twin cannons at home,

31:54.124 --> 31:56.092
and one more on the way.

31:56.176 --> 31:58.911
And if you refuse to sign this,

31:58.962 --> 32:02.799
well, those little baby
cannons might just go hungry.

32:02.883 --> 32:05.551
Baby cannons?

32:05.602 --> 32:07.837
And the mama cannon has fibromyalgia,

32:07.905 --> 32:08.855
so she can't work.

32:11.024 --> 32:13.526
Do you want us to win, or don't you?

32:21.068 --> 32:22.685
How many M's are there
in the letter "R"?

32:22.753 --> 32:23.903
Make an "X."

32:37.245 --> 32:38.445
It's not too late.

32:38.530 --> 32:40.698
To commit social suicide?

32:40.749 --> 32:42.783
How the hell you going to
play with five guys, huh?

32:48.707 --> 32:51.792
You have got to be kidding me.

32:51.877 --> 32:53.511
What the hell are they doing?

32:56.264 --> 32:58.549
What you don't have the balls to do.

33:00.519 --> 33:01.886
Stupid.

33:11.530 --> 33:13.430
Are you ready for this?

33:13.481 --> 33:14.615
Let's kick some ass!

33:20.038 --> 33:22.406
Punch and Judy on one. Ready? Break!

33:22.457 --> 33:23.958
Break. MERCEDES: Who's Judy?

33:24.042 --> 33:24.875
Let's go!

33:25.877 --> 33:27.378
Where do I go?

33:27.445 --> 33:28.579
Stand right there.

33:28.630 --> 33:29.580
What do I do?

33:36.588 --> 33:37.838
You're gonna die.

33:39.307 --> 33:40.224
Blue 42!

33:40.291 --> 33:42.476
Blue 42! Down!

33:42.561 --> 33:43.677
Set! Hike!

33:54.973 --> 33:56.273
Damn it.

34:02.581 --> 34:04.231
What happened? What
happened? Is it over?

34:09.871 --> 34:12.422
All right. How's everyone doing?

34:12.489 --> 34:14.658
Kill me now, I'm gonna die.

34:14.708 --> 34:16.827
Is anyone else tired of
lying down all the time?

34:16.878 --> 34:18.161
I want to play.

34:18.213 --> 34:19.929
Just don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

34:19.998 --> 34:21.966
Ready? Break.

34:22.016 --> 34:23.384
All right, guys. Let's go!

34:25.437 --> 34:26.937
Down!

34:27.005 --> 34:28.005
Blitz. Blitz. Watch.

34:28.056 --> 34:29.056
Set!

34:29.139 --> 34:30.190
Hike!

34:34.612 --> 34:35.813
Get the ball!

34:38.065 --> 34:40.183
Get the ball! Get the ball!

34:40.235 --> 34:41.284
Come on! Get it! Get it!

34:43.353 --> 34:45.371
Go, go, go, go!

34:48.710 --> 34:50.127
Go, go! Go! Go, go, go!

34:58.753 --> 34:59.720
Go!

34:59.804 --> 35:02.089
Tina?

35:02.173 --> 35:04.475
Oh, no.

35:08.647 --> 35:09.763
Is she breathing?

35:15.854 --> 35:17.621
Did we win?

35:31.402 --> 35:32.870
We're still in this.

35:32.921 --> 35:35.005
Give it up, Finn. Our
only shot at redemption

35:35.073 --> 35:36.757
right now is to kick
butt at the halftime show.

35:36.841 --> 35:38.876
Sam!

35:40.378 --> 35:41.912
Come here.

35:41.963 --> 35:43.931
I need you to play quarterback
for the rest of the half.

35:44.015 --> 35:45.132
Okay.

35:45.216 --> 35:46.684
Puck, when the half ends,

35:46.751 --> 35:48.085
you gotta go convince Karofsky
and the rest of the guys

35:48.153 --> 35:49.303
to do the halftime show with us.

35:49.387 --> 35:51.605
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

35:51.690 --> 35:52.856
Figure it out.

35:52.924 --> 35:54.725
You're my wingman, right?

35:54.776 --> 35:56.694
I got tone, Mav.

35:56.761 --> 35:58.962
Where are you going?

35:59.030 --> 36:00.564
Can't have a halftime
show without cheerleaders.

36:10.041 --> 36:12.109
I'm gonna die.

36:12.160 --> 36:14.211
It'll be worth it.

36:14.278 --> 36:15.996
Hey!

36:17.382 --> 36:18.882
What are you doing here?

36:18.950 --> 36:20.367
Stopping you from going to
Sue's Regionals competition.

36:20.435 --> 36:22.169
You guys got to come
to the game with me.

36:22.253 --> 36:24.254
Haven't you been payingttention?

36:24.305 --> 36:26.123
If we're not Cheerios!, we're nothing.

36:26.174 --> 36:27.341
You think that, but it's not true.

36:27.425 --> 36:30.227
You joined Cheerios! to be popular,

36:30.294 --> 36:32.479
but you joined Glee Club
because you loved it.

36:32.564 --> 36:34.832
Sue doesn't care about you guys.

36:34.899 --> 36:36.400
She's fine killing Brittany.

36:36.467 --> 36:37.851
Tell me honestly.

36:37.936 --> 36:39.970
If you didn't think it
would hurt your reputation,

36:40.021 --> 36:41.138
which would you choose?

36:41.189 --> 36:42.523
Glee Club.

36:44.692 --> 36:46.744
I know you,

36:46.811 --> 36:48.695
and you don't think you are,

36:48.780 --> 36:51.198
but you're strong enough to do this.

36:53.401 --> 36:55.318
Okay.

36:55.370 --> 36:57.921
Okay?

36:57.989 --> 36:59.173
Okay.

36:59.257 --> 37:01.125
What about you, Santana?

37:01.176 --> 37:04.261
Screw her- she put me on
the bottom of the pyramid.

37:04.328 --> 37:05.462
Come on, we've oy got a few minutes.

37:05.513 --> 37:07.347
No time for a foursome, ladies.

37:07.432 --> 37:09.349
Bus leaves in five.

37:09.417 --> 37:11.718
We quit Cheerios!

37:11.803 --> 37:13.020
You can't quit Cheerios!

37:13.104 --> 37:14.721
It's blood in, blood out.

37:14.806 --> 37:17.024
Now get your sweet
little cans on that bus.

37:17.108 --> 37:18.859
We still quit.

37:18.943 --> 37:21.278
You're my stars.

37:21.345 --> 37:24.031
If you leave, I have no performance!

37:24.115 --> 37:25.983
Sucks for you.

37:35.326 --> 37:37.244
Looking good out there, Puck.

37:37.328 --> 37:39.163
You know what? I don't
want to hear it, Karofsky.

37:39.214 --> 37:40.964
I don't want to hear it from any of you.

37:41.032 --> 37:42.332
You're all a bunch of cowards.

37:42.383 --> 37:43.750
Coward losers.

37:43.835 --> 37:45.869
Yeah, you're the only
loser losing this game.

37:45.920 --> 37:47.921
You know, this is it.

37:48.006 --> 37:50.057
This is the moment of our lives.

37:50.141 --> 37:52.375
This is the one we
can actually look back

37:52.427 --> 37:53.710
and tell our children about.

37:53.761 --> 37:56.546
This is our moment to
actually win something,

37:56.598 --> 37:58.899
and you guys are sitting
in the damn stands!

38:00.235 --> 38:01.768
I mean, you're so afraid

38:01.853 --> 38:03.520
of being called geeks or losers or gay,

38:03.571 --> 38:06.556
that you settle for being nothing.

38:07.826 --> 38:09.576
Well, we still have
a whole half to play.

38:09.661 --> 38:11.394
And wean win this, guys, I know it.

38:11.446 --> 38:12.646
What's the point, man?

38:12.714 --> 38:14.364
Beiste isn't going to let us play.

38:14.415 --> 38:19.569
She will if you come out and
perform at the halftime show.

38:19.621 --> 38:21.404
I'm in.

38:21.456 --> 38:23.340
Me, too.

38:23.407 --> 38:25.792
No way. Come on, man, I
really want to win this game.

38:25.877 --> 38:27.678
It would mean so much to my dad, man.

38:27.745 --> 38:29.680
Forget it, okay? Glee Club sucks.

38:29.747 --> 38:31.081
Fine, Karofsky's out. Whatever.

38:31.132 --> 38:33.050
But the rest of you need
to get in your zombie makeup

38:33.101 --> 38:34.935
and hit the field toot sweet.

38:35.019 --> 38:36.637
Come on, let's go!

38:36.721 --> 38:38.222

41:40.596 --> 41:43.497
Hey! What are
you guys doing in here?

41:43.549 --> 41:45.166
Oh, we were gonna take
our zombie makeup off

41:45.217 --> 41:46.935
for the second half-
it's kind of itchy.

41:47.002 --> 41:48.553
No. Leave it on.

41:48.637 --> 41:50.521
Maybe we'll freak out the
other guys a little bit,

41:50.606 --> 41:53.024
and we need all the help
we can get right now.

41:53.108 --> 41:54.642
Well, get out there. All of us?

41:57.846 --> 41:59.513
Yeah. All of us.

42:04.019 --> 42:05.620
Yeah!

42:06.739 --> 42:08.189
Welcome back, boy.

42:08.240 --> 42:10.458
Get out there.

42:23.872 --> 42:25.757
Yeah!

42:39.721 --> 42:41.222
Set! Hut-hut!

42:53.869 --> 42:55.119
Someone bit me!

42:55.204 --> 42:56.955
One of those zombies bit me!

42:58.257 --> 43:00.625
Good boy!

43:03.762 --> 43:05.964
Down! Set! One-one!

43:08.050 --> 43:10.601
Block 59! Get on 59!

43:20.980 --> 43:22.981
That was awesome. Nice block.

43:23.048 --> 43:25.066
Nice throw. Bam!

43:27.602 --> 43:28.369
Time out!

43:33.826 --> 43:34.942
It was a good run.

43:34.994 --> 43:36.160
We almost had it.

43:36.245 --> 43:37.962
Hey, this game isn't over.

43:38.047 --> 43:39.780
There's, like, ten
seconds left- it's over.

43:42.668 --> 43:45.169
Not if the quarterback fumbs the snap.

43:47.973 --> 43:50.124
Here's what we're gonna do.

43:50.175 --> 43:51.459

So, tell me, Sue, how
are you holding up?

45:03.198 --> 45:05.133
I'm hanging in there, thank you.

45:05.200 --> 45:07.835
I know it's painful, but...

45:07.903 --> 45:11.756
can you take me back to
the moment when you knew

45:11.840 --> 45:13.707
you had lost what would have been

45:13.759 --> 45:16.978
a record seventh consecutive
national championship,

45:17.045 --> 45:20.714
landing you this interview
as "Loser of the Year"?

45:20.766 --> 45:22.617
I thought this was the
"Ten Most Fascinating. "

45:22.684 --> 45:24.018
That's Barbara Walters.

45:24.069 --> 45:27.321
In the voting, you beat
out the following losers:

45:27.389 --> 45:28.773
the economy,

45:28.857 --> 45:30.024
Mel Gibson,

45:30.092 --> 45:31.892
the housing market,

45:31.944 --> 45:33.945
Dina Lohan, Wall Street,

45:34.029 --> 45:36.998
Tiger Woods, the Dallas Cowboys,

45:37.065 --> 45:39.233
Brett Favre's cell phone,

45:39.284 --> 45:41.235
nine percent unemployment,

45:41.286 --> 45:42.870
and Sparky Lohan,

45:42.921 --> 45:47.175
who is Dina Lohan's dog and
apparently, also a loser.

45:47.242 --> 45:48.793
How do you cope with that?

45:48.877 --> 45:50.578
I've been drinking a lot of bleach.

45:50.629 --> 45:52.130
Do you regret the choice

45:52.214 --> 45:55.349
of attempting to fire a
student out of a cannon?

45:55.417 --> 45:58.453
Other than attracting headlines

45:58.520 --> 46:01.939
and launching a national debate
on the safety of athletes,

46:02.024 --> 46:03.741
was it really worth it?

46:03.809 --> 46:07.261
Honestly, I was just
trying to feel something.

46:07.312 --> 46:09.697
And how do you feel
now that the remainder

46:09.764 --> 46:11.516
of the annual Cheerios! budget

46:11.583 --> 46:13.985
is going to the Glee Club?

46:14.069 --> 46:15.903
I'm sorry? Let's take a look.

46:18.440 --> 46:21.342
Whoops, sorry.

46:21.410 --> 46:23.027
COURIC After
a little song and dance

46:23.095 --> 46:24.629
toupport the arts,

46:24.713 --> 46:26.780
I sat down with McKinley
Glee Club director

46:26.832 --> 46:27.965
Will Schuester.

46:28.050 --> 46:29.467
I have to say, I'm thrilled.

46:29.551 --> 46:31.302
Sue got what was coming to her,

46:31.370 --> 46:35.556
and now we don't have to hold a bake
sale to pay for the bus to Regionals.

46:37.459 --> 46:39.293
Thoughts?

46:41.613 --> 46:44.182
I hate you, Diane Sawyer.

46:46.351 --> 46:48.069
Hey. Hey.

46:48.136 --> 46:49.303
Congrats on the MVP.

46:49.354 --> 46:50.404
Oh, thanks.

46:50.472 --> 46:52.139
It was a team effort.

46:52.191 --> 46:54.158
So, listen, uh,

46:54.243 --> 46:56.777
there's no way the Glee Club's
gonna let you join permanently,

46:56.828 --> 46:58.613
until you clean things up with Kurt.

46:58.664 --> 47:02.983
So I was thinking maybe we cou go
together to Dalton and apologize...

47:03.035 --> 47:05.503
Who said I want to join
the Glee Club permanently?

47:05.587 --> 47:07.488
I just thought after
this week and-and...

47:07.539 --> 47:10.258
the way we won the game and the way you
came out to dance... What do you think?

47:10.325 --> 47:12.476
We all dance around together
and win a football game

47:12.544 --> 47:13.844
and everything's gonna change?

47:13.912 --> 47:17.215
Glee Club's gonna be cool
and we're all gonna sing

47:17.299 --> 47:18.716
hippie peace songs every morning?

47:18.800 --> 47:20.635
Maybe. I-I don't know. It's a start.

47:20.686 --> 47:22.303
No, dude, it's a finish.

47:22.371 --> 47:24.071
Okay? This is high school.

47:24.139 --> 47:26.307
People's memories for good
stuff lasts about as long

47:26.358 --> 47:29.443
as their Facebook status. But we've got
a chance to really change things here.

47:29.511 --> 47:31.896
I just won the conference championship.

47:31.980 --> 47:33.731
I'm on top.

47:33.815 --> 47:37.451
Why would I want to change things?

47:42.324 --> 47:43.491
Hey.

47:43.542 --> 47:44.909
Hi.

47:44.993 --> 47:47.128
I never got a chance to thank you.

47:48.880 --> 47:50.864
For helping me do the right thing.

47:50.916 --> 47:53.834
Aw, you would've come to
it on your own soon enough.

47:53.885 --> 47:56.036
So, how does it feel being
out of the uniform? Weird.

47:56.088 --> 47:58.806
Did turn a couple of heads.

47:58.874 --> 48:00.874
You were amazing this week.

48:02.327 --> 48:04.645
<i>On the field and off.</i>

48:04.713 --> 48:07.148
Reminded me of why I loved you.

48:15.000 --> 48:20.300
