32:47.590 --> 32:48.716
I'm glad to be here.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.010

to the wedding?

32:51.094 --> 32:53.888
{\an3}- Yes, absolutely.
I've reserved.

32:53.971 --> 32:57.392
- I sent Ryan an invitation,
but I don't know if he got it.

32:57.475 --> 33:00.645
{\an3}- I'll ask him.
Ryan texted Larry last week.

33:00.728 --> 33:02.230
{\an3}He wanted to come over
and talk to him

33:02.313 --> 33:04.607
{\an3}and said, "I'm sorry,
I love you and miss you,

33:04.691 --> 33:06.192
and can I come talk to you?"

33:06.275 --> 33:08.528
- Really?
- And Larry text him and said,

33:08.611 --> 33:11.823
{\an3}"I love and miss you too."
And so he came--

33:11.906 --> 33:14.367
{\an1}- They're like, "But if you show
anybody these text messages."

33:14.450 --> 33:16.077
- Yeah, and so he came over

33:16.160 --> 33:19.247
{\an3}and they talked and we're good.
Everybody's good.

33:19.330 --> 33:20.748

that makes me happy.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.250

got into Ryan?

33:24.335 --> 33:25.586
Like, what prompted it?

33:25.670 --> 33:27.714
{\an3}- Mm-mm, he just said
he missed us.

33:27.797 --> 33:30.717
{\an3}It was like, we have to split up
Bentley on the weekends

33:30.800 --> 33:33.094
{\an3}and it's just fun to do stuff
together,

33:33.177 --> 33:34.637

33:34.721 --> 33:36.597

Ryan reached out, yeah.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.434

reach out, yeah, me too.
