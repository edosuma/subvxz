Most of you know Krona's story...

03:37.129 --> 03:41.498

billions of years ago.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.401
He nearly annihilated all of creation.

into disembodied energy...

in the Antimatter realm...

under his control.

04:04.122 --> 04:06.249
We sense this is just the beginning...

04:06.424 --> 04:11.054

the very center of the universe...

04:11.229 --> 04:13.959
