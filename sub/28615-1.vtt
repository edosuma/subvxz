by the time I was 11,

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.273
Ruby's about eight.

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:30.613

that old house in DeSoto.

01:13:37.287 --> 01:13:40.456
Those were me
and Ruby's turkeys.

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:45.878
One morning, he was...

01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:50.883
doing it on top of Ruby.

01:13:54.721 --> 01:13:57.890
And then, he made me
do it to her too.

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:02.854
Then I go down and check
on them turkeys and...

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:04.981
some raccoons had got
their little hands

01:14:05.065 --> 01:14:08.359
through the wires and had been
pulling on them all night.

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:10.611
They was half alive,

01:14:10.696 --> 01:14:13.739
just laying there,
like half a wing or no legs,

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:16.325
just... bleeding.

01:14:24.418 --> 01:14:26.919
He come down, whooped my ass.

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:32.341
Then he give me an old shovel,

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:35.136
and he told me put them out.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:39.891
And...

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:42.810
I said I didn't want to do it,

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:45.313
but he said he was gonna put
Ruby back in the dryer

01:14:45.397 --> 01:14:47.607
if I didn't, so I did it.

01:14:47.691 --> 01:14:51.402
And some of those little turkeys
just wouldn't go, Uncle Doug.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:54.238
I had to whack them

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:56.532
like five or six times.

01:14:59.953 --> 01:15:02.371
- I'm sorry, Gen.

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:07.668
But you gotta trust me.

01:15:07.753 --> 01:15:11.964
It's the only way
you're gonna get through this.

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:21.766

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:24.060

handle Ruby.

01:15:24.144 --> 01:15:26.270
I got her hiding.

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:29.273
I'll go get Ruby and the baby,
and I'll bring them

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:31.984
to the house,
and then you tell the cops

01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:33.945

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:37.240

with Ruby, OK?

01:15:37.324 --> 01:15:39.659

that I did it.

01:15:39.743 --> 01:15:42.745

with taking that baby.
