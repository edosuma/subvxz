WEBVTT

00:06.050 --> 00:07.718
Did you pack your retainer?
Yup!

00:07.719 --> 00:09.920
You have to wear it
for ten hours tonight,

00:09.921 --> 00:11.221
so put it in after din...

00:11.222 --> 00:12.656
After dinner.
Got it covered, Mom.

00:12.657 --> 00:13.857
And don't <i>you</i> forget

00:13.858 --> 00:16.360
to put on the alarm system
before you go to bed.

00:16.361 --> 00:17.310
Did I forget last night?

00:17.311 --> 00:18.362
Yes, you did.

00:18.363 --> 00:20.397
Ugh! What would I do
without you?

00:28.940 --> 00:30.440
She'll be right down.

00:30.441 --> 00:32.509
Well, hello to you, too, Elaine.

00:32.509 --> 00:34.478
With a liveried driver now?

00:34.479 --> 00:37.614
She rolls up to school in that?

00:37.615 --> 00:39.616
What? Chloe likes it.

00:39.617 --> 00:41.551
Makes her feel
important.

00:41.552 --> 00:43.019
Makes you feel important, Roger.
I'm sure it makes

00:43.020 --> 00:44.254
Chloe feel
embarrassed.

00:44.255 --> 00:46.089
I was embarrassed
being dropped off

00:46.090 --> 00:48.558
at school every day
because my father was poor.

00:48.559 --> 00:50.594
Chloe's embarrassed
because her father's rich?

00:50.595 --> 00:54.431
Just tell him to lose
the chauffeur's hat, okay?

00:54.432 --> 00:56.516
Hi, Daddy.
Hey, sweetheart.

00:58.536 --> 01:00.687
Did you notice Mom's
awesome new haircut?

01:00.688 --> 01:03.774
Doesn't it make her look
ten years younger?

01:05.075 --> 01:06.643
You better get going.

01:06.644 --> 01:07.911
See you, Mom.

01:07.912 --> 01:09.112
Love you, Chloe.

01:09.113 --> 01:11.281
Love you, too.

01:21.459 --> 01:23.260
Okay. Thank you.

01:24.095 --> 01:25.996
The Templeton verdict
just came in.

01:25.997 --> 01:27.731
Convicted on all counts

01:27.732 --> 01:29.499
except fraud.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.834
Good work, Counselor.

01:30.835 --> 01:32.769
Hey, thought you'd want to know,

01:32.770 --> 01:34.387
Albany came through
with the funding

01:34.388 --> 01:35.689
for the Joint-Fitter's
Union investigation.

01:35.690 --> 01:37.374
Congratulations.
Yeah.

01:40.311 --> 01:41.845
Sorry. Uh, I was...

01:41.846 --> 01:45.515
I was at this slot car racetrack
last weekend, and I saw this

01:45.516 --> 01:47.584
picture up on the wall--
I could have sworn

01:47.585 --> 01:49.186
it was you
and your brothers as kids.

01:49.187 --> 01:50.887
That old Kensington place.

01:50.888 --> 01:52.322
That's still open?

01:52.323 --> 01:53.657
What were you doing there?

01:53.658 --> 01:56.326
Oh, I take my nephews over there
for the weekend sometimes,

01:56.327 --> 01:57.461
give my sister a break.

01:57.462 --> 02:00.297
You do?
Mm, yeah.

02:00.298 --> 02:01.331
What?

02:01.332 --> 02:02.699
No. I just...

02:02.700 --> 02:04.701
I just didn't see you
as the doting

02:04.702 --> 02:05.969
uncle type, I guess.

02:05.970 --> 02:07.103
Oh, you didn't, huh?

02:07.104 --> 02:08.872
No.
Well, maybe

02:08.872 --> 02:10.607
you don't know everything
about me.

02:10.608 --> 02:11.708
I guess I don't.

02:11.709 --> 02:14.311
Hey.

02:14.312 --> 02:15.595
It's after school already?

02:15.596 --> 02:16.763
Yup, it is.

02:16.764 --> 02:18.047
You must be Nicky.

02:18.048 --> 02:20.550
This is my boss, Mr. Rossellini.

02:20.551 --> 02:21.718
Nice to meet you.

02:21.719 --> 02:22.819
I saw you on TV.

02:22.820 --> 02:24.187
Oh, <i>Dancing with the Stars?</i>

02:24.188 --> 02:25.722
Yeah, right.

02:25.723 --> 02:27.691
Wait. Whoa, whoa. Wait.
You don't think I can dance?

02:27.692 --> 02:29.659
Uh, no. I just... I...

02:29.660 --> 02:31.194
Actually...
My mom's a great dancer.

02:31.195 --> 02:33.062
I am not a great dancer.

02:33.063 --> 02:34.531
I'm sure she is, and I'm
sure you're fantastic.

02:34.532 --> 02:35.632
I'll tell you what.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.167
When you Reagan women
are ready to settle this

02:37.168 --> 02:39.269
on the dance floor...

02:41.756 --> 02:43.974
...let me know.

02:49.013 --> 02:50.597
Mr. Bates is such a tool.

02:50.598 --> 02:51.748
I hate algebra.

02:51.749 --> 02:54.134
Hey, did you finish
reading <i>Jane Eyre?</i>

02:54.135 --> 02:56.419
No, but if I had
Jane Eyre's aunt,

02:56.420 --> 02:58.688
I'd light her bonnet on fire.

02:58.689 --> 03:00.957
Well, we have that test
on Monday.

03:00.958 --> 03:02.359
Some Happy
Valentine's present.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.727
I know.

03:03.728 --> 03:05.061
CliffsNotes?

03:05.062 --> 03:07.497
Mrs. Levitt makes her
tests CliffsNotes-proof.

03:07.498 --> 03:11.451
Ugh! There's no way I'm reading
150 pages this weekend.

03:11.452 --> 03:13.036
Hey, I have an idea.

03:13.037 --> 03:15.739
I'll read 75 pages,
and you read 75 pages.

03:15.740 --> 03:17.474
We'll talk on Sunday night

03:17.475 --> 03:19.326
and then tell each
other what happened.

03:19.327 --> 03:20.610
Genius. Text me later.

03:20.611 --> 03:21.778
Okay.

03:21.779 --> 03:23.213
Peace out,
Girl Scout.

03:40.130 --> 03:41.348
Stop! Stop!

03:41.349 --> 03:42.465
What the hell
are you doing, man?
Help! Help!

03:48.573 --> 03:51.308
That guy just grabbed
a little girl. Did you see that?

03:52.777 --> 03:54.978
That's right, my friend--
you're a loser.

03:54.979 --> 03:58.014
I thought you were liquidating
those positions.

03:58.015 --> 03:59.616
What, you out of your mind?

04:01.586 --> 04:03.787
Hold on a second.

04:05.122 --> 04:08.541
I got to take this.
It's my daughter.

04:10.261 --> 04:11.494
Hey, sweetheart. What's up?

04:11.495 --> 04:14.264
Listen to me and do what I say

04:14.265 --> 04:15.932
if you want to see Chloe again.

04:15.933 --> 04:17.801
What?! Who is this?

04:17.802 --> 04:21.538
I want $5 million in diamonds
by tomorrow.

04:21.539 --> 04:24.107
If the stones are watermarked
or tagged in any way,

04:24.108 --> 04:25.575
your daughter's dead.

04:25.576 --> 04:27.544
What is this, some kind of joke?

04:27.545 --> 04:28.912
Daddy? Daddy?

04:28.913 --> 04:30.280
Chloe?

04:30.281 --> 04:31.448
Daddy, help me.

04:31.449 --> 04:32.816
Chloe, are you all right?

04:32.817 --> 04:34.684
Help me, Daddy, I'm scared.

04:34.685 --> 04:37.687
I'll give you the time
and place tomorrow.

04:37.688 --> 04:39.789
Don't even think
about calling the cops.

04:41.025 --> 04:44.327
Chloe? Baby, are you there?

- Detective Reagan.

05:11.848 --> 05:13.098
Where's the parents?

05:13.099 --> 05:15.651
They're at the top of the stairs.
All right.

05:21.958 --> 05:23.726
Mr. and Mrs. Carson.

05:23.727 --> 05:25.444
Detective Reagan.
This is my partner,

05:25.445 --> 05:27.029
Detective Curatola.
They said they'd call back

05:27.030 --> 05:28.864
tomorrow, but they could call
sooner, don't you think?

05:28.865 --> 05:30.232
The diamonds are arranged for.

05:30.233 --> 05:33.035
There's a Pinkerton
guard bringing them over.

05:33.036 --> 05:35.037
I was assured
you were the top guy.

05:35.038 --> 05:37.456
My partner and I will do
everything we can

05:37.457 --> 05:40.509
to help you get your daughter
back, I can assure you of that.

05:40.510 --> 05:41.710
Okay, so you two
have joint custody?

05:41.711 --> 05:42.845
He has Chloe Tuesdays, Fridays

05:42.846 --> 05:45.164
and every other weekend.
This weekend.

05:45.165 --> 05:47.116
They won't be able to tell
there's surveillance, will they?

05:47.117 --> 05:48.350
They said no cops.

05:48.351 --> 05:50.252
We're taking every precaution.

05:50.253 --> 05:52.488
Is there anyone else who might
have known Chloe's routine?

05:52.489 --> 05:54.623
What time she left school,
the route she took?

05:54.624 --> 05:56.625
Just us, Chloe's friends,

05:56.626 --> 05:57.993
my housekeeper and driver.

05:57.994 --> 05:59.662
What did I tell you, Roger?

05:59.663 --> 06:01.463
Chauffeuring her around
in that ridiculous car,

06:01.464 --> 06:02.898
screaming money.

06:02.899 --> 06:04.934
You were the one who wanted
her to walk everywhere.

06:04.935 --> 06:06.569
If Hugo had picked her up,
we wouldn't be in this...

06:06.570 --> 06:07.836
You're blaming me
for this?

06:08.939 --> 06:10.139
Mr. and Mrs. Carson,

06:10.140 --> 06:11.273
I'm a parent.

06:11.274 --> 06:12.841
I know this must be
very hard on you,

06:12.842 --> 06:14.243
but we really need you
to work together

06:14.244 --> 06:15.978
if we're gonna help
get Chloe back to you, okay?

06:15.979 --> 06:18.280
Sweetheart, have this
tea. It's calming.

06:18.281 --> 06:19.415
And you are...?

06:19.416 --> 06:20.983
Vanessa Morris.

06:20.984 --> 06:22.685
My girlfriend.
His fiancée.

06:23.653 --> 06:24.820
Do you live here?

06:24.821 --> 06:26.789
How is that relevant?

06:26.790 --> 06:29.325
I'm just trying
to get the full story here.

06:29.326 --> 06:30.993
So, we did speak

06:30.994 --> 06:33.345
to a, uh, Lila,
the girl Chloe was walking with.

06:33.346 --> 06:34.430
They're best friends.

06:34.431 --> 06:35.631
Is there anyone else

06:35.632 --> 06:36.765
we should speak to?

06:36.766 --> 06:37.900
Did she have a boyfriend?

06:37.901 --> 06:38.801
No.
No.

06:38.802 --> 06:40.369
She would have told me that.

06:40.370 --> 06:42.671
Oh. Okay.

06:42.672 --> 06:44.873
Um, we're gonna need
to see Chloe's bedroom.

06:44.874 --> 06:48.310
It's right
over here.

06:56.286 --> 06:58.187
Oh, no!

06:58.188 --> 07:00.406
Oh.

07:00.407 --> 07:01.707
I'm so sorry.

07:01.708 --> 07:03.726
Oh, sorry, Mister.

07:06.496 --> 07:09.832
Inez... it's nothing.

07:09.833 --> 07:11.867
The mayor gave it to me.

07:11.868 --> 07:14.036
- Come on.
- I'll fix it.

07:14.037 --> 07:15.638
I'll pay for it.

07:15.639 --> 07:17.389
You okay?

07:17.390 --> 07:19.391
Yes. Thank you.

07:19.392 --> 07:22.227
Did your sister go back
in the hospital?

07:22.228 --> 07:23.412
No, no, no. She's...

07:23.413 --> 07:24.747
The chemotherapy was very good.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.398
She's fine, thank you.

07:26.399 --> 07:28.550
Inez, something's wrong.

07:32.088 --> 07:34.156
My youngest boy.

07:34.157 --> 07:35.724
Eddie, isn't it?

07:36.559 --> 07:39.328
He got arrested last night.

07:39.329 --> 07:41.447
What for?

07:41.448 --> 07:42.564
He didn't do it.

07:42.565 --> 07:44.867
What happened?

07:44.868 --> 07:48.937
He was going to visit a friend
at work,

07:48.938 --> 07:52.007
and-and... a cop car came,

07:52.008 --> 07:55.461
and-and someone in the car
pointed at Eddie

07:55.462 --> 07:56.979
and said, "He's the one."

07:56.980 --> 07:58.447
He said that

07:58.448 --> 08:01.150
Eddie robbed him with a gun.

08:03.386 --> 08:05.354
That's a serious charge.

08:05.355 --> 08:07.189
It's a mistake.

08:07.190 --> 08:10.225
He's never touched a gun
in his life.

08:10.226 --> 08:12.227
He's a good boy.

08:14.497 --> 08:17.733
Inez, the police commissioner
cannot interfere

08:17.734 --> 08:19.735
with an ongoing investigation.

08:19.736 --> 08:21.487
Oh, no, Commissioner.

08:21.488 --> 08:23.839
No. I would never.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.908
Oh, please. No.

08:25.909 --> 08:27.710
No. I'm sorry.

08:27.711 --> 08:29.545
I-I say too much already.

08:29.546 --> 08:31.280
I...
Inez.

08:31.281 --> 08:32.414
I'm going.

08:32.414 --> 08:33.782
I clean your office.

08:33.783 --> 08:36.385
I'm all done, see?

08:38.822 --> 08:41.490
This is interesting.

08:41.491 --> 08:44.226
Chloe's cell phone records.

08:44.227 --> 08:45.561
The only call she received

08:45.562 --> 08:47.596
other than from her mother
and father

08:47.597 --> 08:49.682
every single day
was from a burner cell.

08:49.683 --> 08:50.933
What, no name, paid in full?

08:50.934 --> 08:52.101
Calls started
in September,

08:52.102 --> 08:53.435
ran right up to yesterday.

08:53.436 --> 08:55.838
They stopped pinging off a
cell phone tower in Southampton,

08:55.839 --> 08:57.773
and started pinging off
a cell phone tower

08:57.774 --> 08:59.441
in the West Village.
What do you think?

08:59.442 --> 09:00.743
A summer romance?
I don't know.

09:00.744 --> 09:01.910
It's a secret romance.

09:01.911 --> 09:05.481
Either way, we might
have ourselves our first lead.

09:09.352 --> 09:14.289
So, uh, you been dating anyone
since you and Sydney broke up?

09:14.290 --> 09:16.792
Oh, here and there.
Nothing serious. Why?

09:16.793 --> 09:18.877
Uh, Valentine's
Day is coming up.

09:18.878 --> 09:21.563
I was wondering maybe if
you got any big plans.

09:21.564 --> 09:23.532
Nope. Nothing.
What about you?

09:23.533 --> 09:25.434
As a matter
of fact, I do.

09:25.435 --> 09:26.935
Really?
Yeah.

09:26.936 --> 09:28.937
'Cause I don't know
how you're gonna improve

09:28.938 --> 09:32.174
on that snow globe that you got
your wife for your anniversary.

09:32.175 --> 09:35.210
Hey, she shakes that snow globe
every day, I'll have you know.

09:35.211 --> 09:37.212
Says it makes her
feel peaceful.

09:37.213 --> 09:40.849
But Valentine's Day-- that's
when I go all out, kid.

09:40.850 --> 09:42.234
What's all out
for you, Sarge?

09:42.235 --> 09:44.486
Two-for-one Mondays
at the Pig-n-Whistle?

09:44.487 --> 09:48.040
What would you say to a window
table at the Waterfront Cafe?

09:48.041 --> 09:50.993
With a view of Manhattan
and a bottle of champagne

09:50.994 --> 09:53.796
sitting on the table,
chilled, waiting for us?

09:53.797 --> 09:55.697
I'd say that sounds
pretty romantic.

09:55.698 --> 09:59.384
Yeah? Well, uh, that ain't
where I'm taking her.

09:59.385 --> 10:01.804
At least, not till I
make captain's money.

10:01.805 --> 10:05.574
But I do make a pasta
fazool that she loves.

10:05.575 --> 10:08.444
Your wife's
a very lucky woman.

10:08.445 --> 10:11.513
She is.

10:17.854 --> 10:19.354
Hey, Lila?

10:19.355 --> 10:21.990
Hey, we need to ask you
a few more questions.

10:21.991 --> 10:23.358
Did you find Chloe?

10:23.359 --> 10:24.693
We're working on it.

10:24.694 --> 10:27.229
Look, um, she's been receiving
calls almost every day

10:27.230 --> 10:29.364
from a burner cell, which means
we can't identify the caller.

10:29.365 --> 10:31.233
Do you have any idea
who that might be?

10:31.234 --> 10:32.534
No. Sorry.

10:32.535 --> 10:34.036
Look, Lila,

10:34.037 --> 10:36.505
I was your age once,
and I had a best friend

10:36.506 --> 10:38.040
and we knew everything
about each other.

10:38.041 --> 10:40.242
Lila, look, you probably think
you're protecting Chloe,

10:40.243 --> 10:42.010
but you're not.
This person could be involved.

10:42.011 --> 10:43.612
This person could
even be the kidnapper.

10:43.613 --> 10:44.763
It wasn't.

10:44.764 --> 10:47.132
How do you know that?

10:47.133 --> 10:50.319
Because... it's her boyfriend.

10:50.320 --> 10:51.353
What's his name?

10:51.354 --> 10:52.638
Drew.
Drew what?

10:52.639 --> 10:54.556
I don't know his last name.

10:54.557 --> 10:58.977
He worked as a lifeguard in
the Hamptons last summer.

10:58.978 --> 11:00.445
Talks like this,

11:00.446 --> 11:03.732
but he's really cute,
and they love each other.

11:03.733 --> 11:05.167
Chloe's dad hated him.

11:05.168 --> 11:07.803
So she was seeing him
behind the dad's back?

11:07.804 --> 11:09.488
Her mom didn't like him, either.

11:09.489 --> 11:11.440
He's 19
and doesn't go to college.

11:11.441 --> 11:13.575
He come into the city
to see her?

11:13.576 --> 11:15.610
Almost every weekend.

11:15.611 --> 11:17.913
He crashed at this
scary loft in Bushwick

11:17.914 --> 11:19.114
where a bunch of stoners live.

11:19.115 --> 11:20.716
Do you have the address?

11:20.717 --> 11:22.117
Uh-uh.

11:22.118 --> 11:26.088
Only way I'm going to
Bushwick is in an army tank.

11:26.089 --> 11:27.139
Well, I'm willing to bet
you probably got

11:27.140 --> 11:28.524
a picture of Chloe with him
in that phone

11:28.525 --> 11:30.726
of yours
right there.

11:33.930 --> 11:37.465
Look, we're going to e-mail
this to ourselves, all right?

11:37.466 --> 11:40.035
You don't worry.
You're doing the right thing.

11:40.036 --> 11:41.970
Take it easy.

11:43.823 --> 11:45.841
The boyfriend loves her.

11:45.842 --> 11:47.576
Eh. Or loves her
father's money.

11:47.577 --> 11:50.445
Yeah.

12:02.525 --> 12:04.693
So why hasn't
the kidnapper called?

12:04.694 --> 12:06.328
He'll call, Mr. Carson.

12:06.329 --> 12:08.013
Okay? Just try to relax.

12:08.014 --> 12:10.349
It's torture. Isn't
it, sweetheart?

12:10.350 --> 12:13.535
All right. What about
Chloe's boyfriend Drew?

12:13.536 --> 12:14.903
You mean that lifeguard?

12:14.904 --> 12:16.905
I ended that.

12:16.906 --> 12:18.840
He was too old and mature
for her.

12:18.841 --> 12:21.810
Well, we have reason to believe
that she's still seeing him.

12:23.613 --> 12:25.847
Quiet down!

12:27.283 --> 12:29.735
Yeah. All right, we're on.
Mr. Carson, come on.

12:29.736 --> 12:32.037
Settle down!

12:32.038 --> 12:33.789
I want you to buy
a little time.

12:33.790 --> 12:35.324
All right? You want to
speak to your daughter.

12:35.325 --> 12:37.326
Most important, you want
to stay calm, all right?

12:37.327 --> 12:38.377
We ready to go?

12:38.378 --> 12:40.045
Yeah.
Okay. Settle!

12:41.698 --> 12:43.548
Hello?

12:43.549 --> 12:44.933
Meet me at the corner

12:44.934 --> 12:46.668
of St. Mark's Place
and First Avenue at 2:00.

12:46.669 --> 12:49.171
I'll be wearing
a yellow baseball cap.

12:49.172 --> 12:50.739
Do you have the diamonds?

12:50.740 --> 12:52.374
Yes, they're here.
Uh...

12:52.375 --> 12:54.726
Uh, where did you say
to meet you?

12:54.727 --> 12:56.094
I just have to write it down.

12:56.095 --> 12:57.429
Shut up and listen.

12:57.430 --> 12:59.414
Put the diamonds
in a metal thermos. No GPS,

12:59.415 --> 13:01.850
and no cops, if you want
to see your daughter again.

13:01.851 --> 13:03.685
I want to talk to Chloe.

13:05.588 --> 13:06.822
Daddy?

13:06.823 --> 13:08.156
Hey, baby.

13:08.157 --> 13:10.325
Listen, I'm going to get
you out of this, okay?

13:10.326 --> 13:12.160
Where's Mom?

13:12.161 --> 13:14.112
Uh, she's right here. Hold on.

13:14.113 --> 13:16.198
Sweetheart, are you all right?

13:16.199 --> 13:18.934
Mommy. Mommy, I'm so scared.

13:18.935 --> 13:20.168
Chloe?

13:20.169 --> 13:22.270
Chloe?!
East Third and Bowery.

13:22.271 --> 13:23.705
We can send a radio car.
No. The caller's going

13:23.706 --> 13:25.007
to be in the wind.
We got to move.

13:25.008 --> 13:26.208
Rog, she sounded awful.

13:26.209 --> 13:27.342
I'm going to get her back,
Elaine, I promise.

13:27.343 --> 13:28.343
So what happens now?

13:28.344 --> 13:30.012
We got an hour
to set up surveillance.

13:30.013 --> 13:31.847
We'll make the drop, and we'll
follow him to your daughter.

13:31.848 --> 13:33.248
Well, he said no cops.

13:33.249 --> 13:35.050
Listen, you're gonna do the
drop, then you'll move off.

13:35.051 --> 13:36.251
They won't make us.
Don't worry.

13:36.252 --> 13:38.253
But what if they do?
I just want my daughter back!

13:38.254 --> 13:40.222
They won't make us, Mr. Carson.
Please. Just trust me, okay?

13:40.223 --> 13:41.757
They won't make us. We'll
get your daughter back.

13:41.758 --> 13:43.475
We've got to trust them.

13:43.476 --> 13:44.609
Listen to the detectives.

13:44.610 --> 13:46.728
They know what they're doing.

13:46.729 --> 13:47.946
No pressure.
Yeah, right.

13:47.947 --> 13:50.599
Let's go.

14:16.259 --> 14:17.554
You get a look at
those diamonds?

14:17.941 --> 14:19.859
Mmm.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.461
It's hard to believe
something so small

14:21.493 --> 14:22.627
could be worth
a girl's life.

14:22.656 --> 14:24.858
Mm-hmm.

14:31.215 --> 14:32.716
All right, there's our boy.

14:32.779 --> 14:34.480
Yellow hoodie
and the baseball hat.

14:34.481 --> 14:36.148
He looks like a
homeless guy.

14:36.149 --> 14:37.783
You got something for me?

14:37.784 --> 14:39.585
Where's my daughter?

14:39.586 --> 14:40.920
- What?
- Tell me where my daughter is!

14:40.921 --> 14:42.121
What the hell's
wrong with you, man?

14:42.122 --> 14:44.290
Get off me!

14:45.258 --> 14:46.509
If anything happens to her...

14:46.510 --> 14:47.827
Come on. Give him the
diamonds already.

14:47.828 --> 14:48.761
...I'm gonna hunt you down

14:48.762 --> 14:50.963
and kill you
with my own hands.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.850
All right.
He made the exchange.

14:54.851 --> 14:56.535
Green coat, yellow hat.

14:56.536 --> 14:58.170
We got him in sight.

14:58.171 --> 14:59.872
We're on him.

15:02.709 --> 15:04.944
Be advised,
the payoff went down.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.012
Suspect is a white male,

15:07.013 --> 15:10.316
approximately 36,

15:10.317 --> 15:11.817
heading east
on St. Mark's,

15:11.818 --> 15:13.235
wearing a yellow hat.

15:13.236 --> 15:14.570
Stay with him.

15:21.194 --> 15:23.462
Hey, watch out.

15:42.416 --> 15:44.683
♪
♪

16:00.767 --> 16:02.568
Looks like he's
waiting for someone.

16:02.569 --> 16:04.203
Hold fast.

16:16.116 --> 16:17.917
What's he doing
with the diamonds?

16:19.419 --> 16:21.020
Let's move.

16:23.890 --> 16:26.442
Hey!

16:26.443 --> 16:28.594
Come here. Come here.

16:28.595 --> 16:30.729
Get off of me.
I didn't do anything.

16:30.730 --> 16:32.264
Shut up. Where's the girl?
Here's the ransom.

16:32.265 --> 16:34.116
Give me my hundred bucks!
Where's the girl?

16:34.117 --> 16:35.701
What girl?
Just give me my money.

16:35.702 --> 16:37.436
Money for what?

16:37.437 --> 16:38.537
Huh?

16:38.538 --> 16:40.322
You promised me a hundred bucks.
We had a deal.

16:40.323 --> 16:42.708
I didn't promise you
anything, dipstick.

16:42.709 --> 16:43.742
I'm a cop. Come on.

16:43.743 --> 16:45.878
Let's go.

16:45.879 --> 16:48.180
Come on.

16:52.853 --> 16:55.087
Let's hold on a minute.

16:55.088 --> 16:57.690
Why don't you two
go down the street

16:57.691 --> 16:59.258
and have a cup of coffee?

16:59.259 --> 17:01.694
I can't let you
go in there alone, sir.

17:01.695 --> 17:03.429
It's a pastry shop, Baker.

17:03.430 --> 17:05.396
It's protocol, sir.

17:05.397 --> 17:07.700
Okay, I'm your boss, right?

17:07.701 --> 17:09.702
Yes, sir.

17:09.703 --> 17:11.369
I order you two to
go down the street

17:11.371 --> 17:12.704
and have a cup of coffee.

17:12.705 --> 17:15.608
If you're not out

17:15.608 --> 17:16.876
in ten minutes,
we're coming in.

17:16.877 --> 17:19.211
Weapons drawn, I expect.

17:23.316 --> 17:25.501
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

17:32.008 --> 17:33.425
Commissioner.

17:33.426 --> 17:35.594
Please sit down.

17:39.966 --> 17:42.635
This place
was on my old beat.

17:42.636 --> 17:45.704
I'm sorry about
all the intrigue,

17:45.705 --> 17:47.306
Detective Ryan.
I didn't want

17:47.307 --> 17:48.541
to go to the precinct.

17:48.542 --> 17:51.677
It always turns
into such a big deal.

17:51.678 --> 17:54.380
But I could use some advice.

17:54.381 --> 17:56.115
Yes, sir.

17:56.116 --> 17:59.852
You collared a suspect
the other day, Edward Saldana.

17:59.853 --> 18:03.422
Uh, yes, sir. Armed robbery.

18:03.423 --> 18:05.791
Well, the vic made
a positive I.D.

18:05.792 --> 18:08.060
on the canvass
soon after the incident.

18:08.061 --> 18:09.895
And Saldana,

18:09.896 --> 18:11.463
he didn't have the gun
or the vic's wallet,

18:11.464 --> 18:12.631
but he had the contents.

18:12.632 --> 18:15.367
Yeah. Most of a hundred bucks
and the MetroCard.

18:15.368 --> 18:19.271
Saldana told me
that he was on the East Side

18:19.272 --> 18:22.241
to visit a friend, sir,
in a building that he worked in,

18:22.242 --> 18:23.559
and the friend was not there.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.578
Pretty thin alibi.

18:25.579 --> 18:27.813
I read your fives.

18:27.814 --> 18:29.982
Looks like a good arrest.

18:29.983 --> 18:32.451
Here's my problem.

18:32.452 --> 18:35.321
I know the mother.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.756
I met the kid.

18:37.757 --> 18:38.924
He didn't seem likely to go bad.

18:38.925 --> 18:41.360
But that was a long time ago.

18:43.630 --> 18:46.599
We always say that
it's just as important

18:46.600 --> 18:48.834
to work hard to exonerate
an innocent person

18:48.835 --> 18:51.203
as it is to convict
a guilty one.

18:53.206 --> 18:56.208
If you think it warrants
a second look...

19:04.317 --> 19:07.136
What a surprise.

19:09.756 --> 19:11.523
I told you,

19:11.524 --> 19:14.093
I've never seen
that guy before.

19:14.094 --> 19:16.562
Somebody came up to me,
offered me a hundred bucks

19:16.563 --> 19:17.796
to pick up a thermos.

19:17.797 --> 19:18.930
What did he look like?

19:18.931 --> 19:19.898
I have no idea.

19:19.899 --> 19:21.667
He had a ski mask on.

19:21.668 --> 19:23.268
And that didn't strike you
as odd?

19:23.269 --> 19:24.703
It's freezing out.

19:24.704 --> 19:26.488
I wish I had one.

19:26.489 --> 19:27.573
You're not going to have to
worry about the cold weather

19:27.574 --> 19:28.741
much longer. We've got you

19:28.742 --> 19:29.908
on an active burglary warrant.

19:29.909 --> 19:31.410
Now you're a co-defendant
in a kidnapping.

19:31.411 --> 19:32.944
Kidnapping?

19:32.945 --> 19:33.963
You're out of
your mind, man.

19:33.964 --> 19:35.748
Hey! You're out of your mind.
Whoa!

19:35.749 --> 19:37.650
Now, who hired you?

19:37.651 --> 19:40.502
Who hired you to pick up
the ransom, you junkie?

19:40.503 --> 19:43.288
Ransom?
I mean, it was a hundred bucks.

19:43.289 --> 19:45.157
He offered me a hundred bucks.

19:45.158 --> 19:47.959
Hey, I just want
my hundred bucks

19:47.960 --> 19:49.511
to score, to f-fix.

19:49.512 --> 19:52.231
I just want a fix. Please.
All right?

20:01.307 --> 20:02.641
He's probably
telling the truth.

20:02.642 --> 20:04.777
Why don't you book him,
take him down to Bellevue,

20:04.778 --> 20:06.011
get him a little methadone.

20:06.012 --> 20:08.247
I'll go do the heavy lifting
with the family.

20:08.248 --> 20:11.750
Well, I owe you one.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.338
Mr. and Mrs. Carson.

20:16.339 --> 20:18.040
Where's Chloe?
What happened?

20:18.041 --> 20:19.291
We didn't get her.

20:19.292 --> 20:21.060
The guy with the yellow cap

20:21.061 --> 20:22.661
turned out to be a messenger.
I'm sorry.

20:22.662 --> 20:25.230
So you don't know
where Chloe is?

20:25.231 --> 20:27.299
What did he just say,
Vanessa?

20:27.300 --> 20:28.634
Look, I understand
your frustration.

20:28.635 --> 20:29.702
No, you don't!

20:29.703 --> 20:30.869
Chloe's not your daughter!

20:30.870 --> 20:33.004
Rog, please.
The kidnappers want the ransom.

20:33.005 --> 20:34.223
They're-they're going
to call back.

20:34.224 --> 20:35.274
Something happened, that's all.

20:35.275 --> 20:36.859
I know, I just...

20:36.860 --> 20:38.844
I feel helpless.

20:38.845 --> 20:40.813
It's okay.
We're not giving up yet.

20:40.814 --> 20:42.314
Excuse me.

20:42.315 --> 20:45.451
Please tell me
you got something.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.236
Okay, the boyfriend's name
is Drew Leland.

20:47.237 --> 20:49.655
He's in the system
for a no-contest

20:49.656 --> 20:51.857
misdemeanor assault
back in high school.

20:51.858 --> 20:53.242
I went to the parents.

20:53.243 --> 20:54.426
They say he took a job

20:54.427 --> 20:57.062
line-fishing some bluefin tuna
out in Montauk,

20:57.063 --> 20:59.331
and they don't have any idea
when he's coming back.

20:59.332 --> 21:01.400
Okay. What about this Bushwick
loft he's been hanging out in?

21:01.401 --> 21:03.035
Do his parents have
an address for that?

21:03.036 --> 21:04.536
The parents
don't even know it exists.

21:04.537 --> 21:06.872
But his bank records indicate

21:06.873 --> 21:08.307
a purchase on his debit card

21:08.308 --> 21:11.143
to buy some caviar
at Dean and Deluca in SoHo.

21:11.144 --> 21:13.345
Guess when? Yesterday.

21:13.346 --> 21:14.780
Great. Drew and his accomplice,

21:14.781 --> 21:16.548
celebrating
the $5 million ransom.

21:16.549 --> 21:18.217
Exactly.

21:18.218 --> 21:20.402
All right.
I'll talk to you in a minute.

21:24.290 --> 21:25.791
Thanks.

21:25.792 --> 21:27.860
Is there news?

21:27.861 --> 21:29.261
They found the kidnap van
in an alley in Brooklyn.

21:29.262 --> 21:31.080
I'm gonna head over there now.
What about Chloe?

21:31.081 --> 21:33.332
It's just the car,
but I'm going to go over there.

21:33.333 --> 21:34.566
I'm going to see what's over
there and I'll call you.

21:34.567 --> 21:36.034
Sit tight, okay?

21:47.914 --> 21:49.181
What do we got?

21:49.182 --> 21:50.616
A guy walking his dog
saw a fire

21:50.617 --> 21:52.618
in an ash can
and called it in.

21:52.619 --> 21:54.720
Officer on the scene made
the van from the Finest message.

21:54.721 --> 21:56.588
Did he? Good eyes.
Yeah.

21:56.589 --> 21:58.557
Somebody knew what
they were doing, though.

21:58.558 --> 21:59.792
I'm not getting any prints
off the steering wheel,

21:59.793 --> 22:00.759
gearshift or door handles.

22:00.760 --> 22:02.694
Nothing?
Uh-uh.

22:02.695 --> 22:03.662
Hey, Reagan.

22:03.663 --> 22:05.096
Hey.
Come check this out.

22:05.097 --> 22:06.598
Thanks.

22:06.599 --> 22:07.766
What do you got?

22:07.767 --> 22:09.101
Ooh.

22:09.102 --> 22:11.069
Bottle of Dom Pérignon,
the king of champagnes.

22:11.070 --> 22:12.788
Huh. Doesn't
exactly look like

22:12.789 --> 22:14.456
a Dom Pérignon
kind of neighborhood.

22:14.457 --> 22:15.958
No.
What is that, caviar?

22:15.959 --> 22:18.076
Yeah.

22:18.077 --> 22:19.778
Maybe Mr. Dean
and Deluca was here.

22:19.779 --> 22:20.879
Yeah.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.514
Look at that lipstick
on the glass.

22:22.515 --> 22:24.249
Lipstick.

22:24.250 --> 22:26.485
What do you think,
it was a female driver?

22:26.486 --> 22:27.886
Or it's Chloe's.

22:27.887 --> 22:29.788
Then there's that.

22:29.789 --> 22:32.007
Okay, lipstick on the glass,
but the van's perfectly clean.

22:32.008 --> 22:34.927
I can't figure out if this is
a kidnapping or a date.

22:34.928 --> 22:36.562
Well, if this is a kidnapping,

22:36.563 --> 22:38.797
I'd like to be kidnapped
next Valentine's Day.

22:48.350 --> 22:50.467
What about the champagne flutes?

22:50.468 --> 22:52.269
Amazing.

22:52.270 --> 22:53.521
Yeah, all right.

22:53.522 --> 22:55.739
Let me guess.

22:55.740 --> 22:57.441
The prints on the glass
were Chloe's,

22:57.442 --> 23:00.110
and the ones on the bottle
on the other glass were...

23:00.111 --> 23:01.445
Drew Leland. Yeah.

23:01.446 --> 23:02.580
Looks like Romeo and Juliet

23:02.581 --> 23:04.665
were having themselves
a little bit of a party.

23:04.666 --> 23:06.650
Couple of kids trying to run off
with the parents' money.

23:06.651 --> 23:08.853
Awesome. I'm gonna go to the
old man's and eat dinner.

23:11.356 --> 23:14.959
Bless us, our Lord, for these
gifts we're about to receive

23:14.960 --> 23:16.710
from your bountiful hands.

23:16.711 --> 23:17.828
Amen.

23:17.829 --> 23:19.597
Amen.
Well done.

23:19.598 --> 23:21.465
I smell something delicious.

23:22.133 --> 23:23.133
What is it?

23:23.134 --> 23:24.301
Bossa nova.

23:24.302 --> 23:25.669
Your Aunt Erin make it.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.972
Osso buco, Grandpa.

23:27.973 --> 23:30.057
Bossa nova, osso buco.

23:30.058 --> 23:31.342
What's the difference?

23:31.343 --> 23:32.610
But, Mom, like, what is it?

23:33.528 --> 23:34.745
It's braised veal shanks.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.680
Oh.

23:36.681 --> 23:38.399
Hey, everyone.
Hey.
Hi.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.618
Hi, Dad.
Hi, boys. Hey.

23:40.619 --> 23:42.069
Hey.
Hey.

23:42.070 --> 23:43.353
Hey, Gramps.

23:43.354 --> 23:45.372
How's it going out there?

23:45.373 --> 23:46.991
Ah, crazy case, Dad.

23:46.992 --> 23:48.692
We just had to tell
these parents

23:48.693 --> 23:50.394
the daughter probably staged
her own kidnapping.

23:50.395 --> 23:52.062
What?
Oh, yeah.

23:52.063 --> 23:53.197
They're not buying it, though.

23:53.198 --> 23:54.298
It's like talking to a wall.

23:54.299 --> 23:55.833
Why you think, for the money?

23:55.834 --> 23:56.917
I don't know.

23:56.918 --> 23:58.636
I haven't figured
that part out yet.

23:58.637 --> 24:00.070
We just arranged
a ransom pickup.

24:00.071 --> 24:01.171
Nobody showed up.

24:01.172 --> 24:04.258
Wow. Even so,
poor parents.

24:04.259 --> 24:05.509
Well, they're not exactly poor.

24:05.510 --> 24:06.710
In fact, they're very rich.

24:06.711 --> 24:07.895
It's just a messy situation.

24:07.896 --> 24:09.930
Divorce, live-in girlfriend,
you know.

24:09.931 --> 24:12.215
Okay, let's change the subject.

24:12.216 --> 24:14.718
Why? I'm not upset
about Dad's girlfriend. Are you?

24:14.719 --> 24:16.386
No.

24:16.387 --> 24:18.355
He's taking her
to Anguilla

24:18.356 --> 24:19.406
for Valentine's Day,

24:19.407 --> 24:21.325
but Mom and I have a date,
right, Mom?

24:21.326 --> 24:22.626
That's right.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.094
Nicky wanted to have Peking Duck

24:24.095 --> 24:26.830
in the city, so, Peking
Duck she will have.

24:26.831 --> 24:29.033
Valentine's Day. Ug!

24:29.034 --> 24:30.434
Why?

24:30.435 --> 24:32.036
Because it's one
of those holidays

24:32.037 --> 24:34.572
that is dreamed up
by the greeting card companies.

24:35.757 --> 24:36.907
What's a greeting card?

24:36.908 --> 24:38.375
Mm. It's something people

24:38.376 --> 24:40.044
used to send
before e-cards, honey.

24:40.045 --> 24:42.479
I'm making Mom a
nice card in school,

24:42.480 --> 24:43.747
but it's a surprise.

24:46.685 --> 24:48.419
Is that another Reagan trait,
Grandpa?

24:48.420 --> 24:49.587
Do you think
it's hooey?

24:49.588 --> 24:50.955
Well, I thought it was great,

24:50.956 --> 24:52.389
but your Grandma Mary
didn't like

24:52.390 --> 24:54.091
making a big deal out of it.

24:54.092 --> 24:55.926
She always

24:55.927 --> 24:57.427
hated the idea of being required

24:57.428 --> 24:59.697
to express her love
on a certain day.

24:59.698 --> 25:01.465
Well, that's Mom to a tee.

25:01.466 --> 25:03.651
Reagan women don't like
to be told what to do.

25:03.652 --> 25:06.203
No, we don't.
Still, it's one of those days.

25:06.204 --> 25:07.972
You know, you're supposed
to be hooked up,

25:07.973 --> 25:09.573
and it's a reminder
if you're not.

25:09.574 --> 25:11.942
You know, it's like a pressure
point, like New Year's Eve.

25:11.943 --> 25:14.812
What do you mean by that-- pressure point?
I don't know.

25:14.813 --> 25:16.981
It's just one of those days when
you're supposed to be happy,

25:16.982 --> 25:18.349
or you measure your happiness.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.483
Some people propose,

25:19.484 --> 25:21.018
other people are disappointed
by their mates,

25:21.019 --> 25:22.486
or if they're alone,

25:22.487 --> 25:24.388
it exacerbates their loneliness.

25:24.389 --> 25:27.257
You know,
you may be a genius, kid.

25:27.258 --> 25:28.892
Exacerbate. Worsen.
No, no.

25:28.893 --> 25:30.127
The whole Valentine's Day,
pressure point thing.

25:30.128 --> 25:31.261
I'm gonna get back to work.

25:31.262 --> 25:32.596
Okay, Dad?

25:32.597 --> 25:33.631
You just got here.

25:33.632 --> 25:34.982
I got to get back to work.

25:34.983 --> 25:36.200
Pork chops were great.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.301
Pork chops.

25:37.302 --> 25:38.202
What?

25:38.203 --> 25:39.770
Go!
Lamb chops. Whatever.

25:39.771 --> 25:41.205
Come on, go.
Bye. Bye, boys.

25:53.685 --> 25:56.820
Are you busy, Grandpa?

25:56.821 --> 25:58.689
Not for you.

26:02.127 --> 26:03.377
What are you doing?

26:03.378 --> 26:07.297
Oh, I was thinking
about your grandma.

26:07.298 --> 26:09.717
I found this box

26:09.718 --> 26:12.353
after she died.

26:12.354 --> 26:15.505
You know what I said about how
she felt about Valentine's Day.

26:15.506 --> 26:17.474
Well...

26:17.475 --> 26:19.643
turns out she saved
every Valentine's Day card

26:19.644 --> 26:21.412
I ever gave her,

26:21.413 --> 26:24.481
40 years worth.

26:24.482 --> 26:26.784
You miss her.

26:28.620 --> 26:31.155
Every day.

26:32.690 --> 26:35.159
So what's up?

26:35.160 --> 26:37.244
I think I might
have screwed up.

26:37.245 --> 26:39.196
Oh?

26:39.197 --> 26:43.233
I-I just didn't want Mom to
be alone on Valentine's Day.

26:43.234 --> 26:44.368
Well, she's not gonna be.

26:44.369 --> 26:45.669
You're going out
for Peking Duck.

26:45.670 --> 26:48.706
Well, that's only
half the story.

26:49.674 --> 26:52.226
I called her boss and
asked him to meet us,

26:52.227 --> 26:54.878
and I was going to
ask you or Uncle Jamie

26:54.879 --> 26:57.047
or someone to
come get me.

26:57.048 --> 26:59.016
You called Charley Rossellini?

26:59.017 --> 27:01.385
I saw them talking
after school,

27:01.386 --> 27:03.687
and you could tell
they liked each other.

27:07.742 --> 27:09.660
Well, I'll be honest.

27:09.661 --> 27:11.128
I don't like the guy.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.831
But that's beside the point.

27:13.832 --> 27:15.966
Why do you think you screwed up?

27:15.967 --> 27:17.067
I don't know.

27:17.068 --> 27:19.069
I thought it was
a really good idea.

27:19.070 --> 27:21.171
Hmm.

27:21.172 --> 27:25.209
Just, after I hung up,
I was sorry I did it.

27:26.377 --> 27:29.279
I mean, I want her
to be happy, I do.

27:33.585 --> 27:36.019
Do you like my dad?

27:41.726 --> 27:43.727
I like your dad.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.531
But I love my daughter.

27:47.532 --> 27:49.733
That's what happens in divorce.

27:49.734 --> 27:52.435
People feel like
they got to take sides.

27:57.475 --> 27:59.643
But you don't.

28:03.982 --> 28:06.216
Nicky, school night.
We have to go.

28:06.217 --> 28:08.886
Okay, Mom.

28:11.956 --> 28:14.158
Good night, Grandpa.

28:17.795 --> 28:19.630
Good night, sweetheart.

28:27.238 --> 28:29.656
No phone calls,
e-mails, nothing.

28:29.657 --> 28:32.910
Task force is chasing down the
boyfriend's Bushwick address.

28:35.413 --> 28:36.580
In the, uh...

28:36.581 --> 28:37.831
...meantime.

28:37.832 --> 28:40.250
We wanted to ask you,
uh, and Ms. Morris

28:40.251 --> 28:42.319
a few questions of
a personal nature

28:42.320 --> 28:43.754
about your relationship.

28:43.755 --> 28:46.690
We're all adults here.

28:46.691 --> 28:48.892
Oh, okay. Well, um,

28:48.893 --> 28:50.660
you know, in a
situation like this,

28:50.661 --> 28:52.329
we always have
to wonder why.

28:52.330 --> 28:54.331
As in, if Chloe did, in fact,

28:54.332 --> 28:55.732
plan her own kidnapping,

28:55.733 --> 28:58.068
why would she do that?
I mean, what would trigger her?

28:58.069 --> 28:59.837
And?

28:59.838 --> 29:00.971
Well,

29:00.972 --> 29:02.055
the other day,

29:02.056 --> 29:04.074
when you two discussed
your relationship,

29:04.075 --> 29:05.475
you referred to Ms. Morris

29:05.476 --> 29:06.810
as your girlfriend, but

29:06.811 --> 29:09.813
she referred to
you as her fiancé.

29:09.814 --> 29:11.615
I mean, Valentine's Day--
you know it's a big day

29:11.616 --> 29:12.816
for relationships.

29:12.817 --> 29:15.152
So I was wondering,
did you two have any plans?

29:16.054 --> 29:17.371
We were going to dinner.

29:17.372 --> 29:19.223
Dinner?

29:19.224 --> 29:22.059
You kept saying it was
going to be so special.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.578
Valentine's Day
tasting menu at Per Se?

29:24.579 --> 29:27.197
I'd call that special--
a thousand dollars a pop.

29:27.198 --> 29:28.799
I was thinking

29:28.800 --> 29:30.767
you were going to propose.

29:35.907 --> 29:38.475
Ms. Morris,
did you by any chance

29:38.476 --> 29:42.179
tell Chloe that her dad was
planning on proposing to you?

29:42.180 --> 29:45.315
Well, but... why wouldn't I?

29:45.316 --> 29:46.733
We're really close.

29:46.734 --> 29:47.885
I-I love Chloe.

29:47.886 --> 29:50.120
You told Chloe
we were getting married?

29:50.121 --> 29:51.855
What were you thinking?

29:51.856 --> 29:53.891
I was thinking
that you loved me,

29:53.892 --> 29:56.260
and that it was time.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.701
So, particulars

30:04.702 --> 30:07.671
of Drew Leland's
Internet account came in.

30:07.672 --> 30:10.107
Seems like he's been downloading
some movies lately.

30:10.108 --> 30:13.377
Uh, <i>Taken, Trapped,</i>
and <i>Excess Baggage.</i>

30:13.378 --> 30:15.913
It's about a rich girl
faking her own kidnapping.

30:15.914 --> 30:16.914
Right.

30:16.915 --> 30:18.282
Oh, God.
We got an address

30:18.283 --> 30:19.082
for that account?
Yeah.

30:19.083 --> 30:20.717
All right,
you know what?

30:20.718 --> 30:22.269
We'll notify ESU and the Hostage
Negotiating team on the way.

30:22.270 --> 30:24.154
You two sit tight.
We'll get back to you.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.323
Let's go get him.

30:29.694 --> 30:31.445
We're in. Let's
move, let's move.

30:31.446 --> 30:33.497
All right, going right.
Going right.

30:35.950 --> 30:37.600
We're clear.

30:37.601 --> 30:39.870
Clear.

30:41.439 --> 30:43.106
Clear!

30:47.879 --> 30:50.814
Hey, Jack,
we got a fresh one in here.

30:50.815 --> 30:52.149
Yeah.

30:53.818 --> 30:56.119
Rest is clear.
What's this?

30:56.120 --> 30:57.804
We got the boyfriend, Drew Leland.
Oh.

30:57.805 --> 30:59.056
Yeah...
The ex-boyfriend.

30:59.057 --> 31:00.841
It would explain
why he didn't show up

31:00.842 --> 31:01.975
for the ransom yesterday.

31:01.976 --> 31:04.294
Well, unless Chloe shot him,

31:04.295 --> 31:05.795
third person theory is correct.

31:05.796 --> 31:07.998
Then Chloe's not just in the
hands of a kidnapper anymore.

31:07.999 --> 31:09.866
She's in the hands of a murderer.
Yeah.

31:19.027 --> 31:22.193
12 of us live here. We come
and go at all different times.

31:22.216 --> 31:23.445
I just got back.

31:23.517 --> 31:25.241
Drew's here,
like, half the month?

31:26.140 --> 31:28.657
Before now, have you seen
Drew here in the last two days?

31:28.841 --> 31:30.041
No, man. He's got...

31:30.042 --> 31:31.726
His room has its own entrance.

31:31.727 --> 31:33.378
I didn't even know he was here.

31:33.379 --> 31:35.710
It's, like, freaking me out
that somebody killed him.

31:35.781 --> 31:38.852
You ever see this girl here?
A couple times.

31:38.884 --> 31:41.553
Yeah. I passed her on the way
to the, uh, bathroom,

31:41.553 --> 31:44.089
but, um, I mean,
I don't really know her.

31:44.123 --> 31:45.990
Well, we're thinking this girl
and Drew may have planned

31:45.991 --> 31:47.158
to fake her own kidnapping.

31:47.159 --> 31:48.660
Problem is, they got
someone else involved now

31:48.661 --> 31:49.761
who has taken over.

31:49.762 --> 31:51.796
We need to find out
who that person is.

31:51.797 --> 31:55.633
Oh, man, that sucks.

31:55.634 --> 31:58.236
So, uh, this Drew--
does he hang out

31:58.237 --> 32:00.105
with anyone
who was violent or had

32:00.106 --> 32:01.873
a drug problem?
I don't know, man.

32:01.874 --> 32:04.542
Um, this is, like, a lot
for me right now.

32:05.678 --> 32:06.845
Excuse me.

32:06.846 --> 32:08.063
You see that graffiti
over there?

32:08.064 --> 32:09.380
Take a look at it.

32:09.381 --> 32:12.584
I saw that same thing up
in Drew's room over there.

32:12.585 --> 32:14.052
You know who wrote it?

32:14.053 --> 32:15.487
Yeah, man. That's Taze.

32:15.488 --> 32:16.604
He's a graffiti artist.

32:16.605 --> 32:18.156
Drew buys pot off him.

32:18.157 --> 32:19.741
He's, uh...

32:19.742 --> 32:21.226
He's intense. Ow.

32:21.227 --> 32:22.794
He's not half as intense as me,

32:22.795 --> 32:25.229
you knucklehead. Now, your
buddy Drew just got killed.

32:25.230 --> 32:27.098
Don't you think we might want
to know who this Taze is?

32:27.099 --> 32:28.700
Huh? Where's he live?

32:28.701 --> 32:32.070
A squat somewhere in East
New York, an old factory...

32:32.071 --> 32:34.739
Can you just,
like, chill out, man?

32:34.740 --> 32:36.508
Reagan, uh,

32:36.509 --> 32:40.044
that was a TARU tech
over at Carson's loft.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.180
It seems
that an e-mail just came in

32:42.181 --> 32:45.483
from a dummy e-mail address,
and there's a video attached.

32:46.302 --> 32:48.953
I'm not looking for diamonds.

32:48.954 --> 32:50.889
I want a million in cash.

32:50.890 --> 32:52.390
Put it in a duffel bag,

32:52.391 --> 32:54.809
and bring it to the playground
at Tompkins Square Park

32:54.810 --> 32:56.361
tomorrow at noon.

32:56.362 --> 32:57.729
Unmarked bills.

32:57.730 --> 33:00.265
If you're not there alone
with the money,

33:00.266 --> 33:01.533
I kill your daughter.

33:05.488 --> 33:08.139
You got something
to say to Daddy, little girl?

33:09.742 --> 33:12.577
Daddy, I'm sorry.

33:12.578 --> 33:15.413
I'm so sorry, Daddy.

33:15.414 --> 33:18.133
I don't think
she likes it here, Daddy.

33:18.134 --> 33:20.218
Oh, my God. Oh, my baby.

33:20.219 --> 33:21.719
Mrs. Carson, it's okay.

33:21.720 --> 33:22.854
What is he doing?
It's okay. Look...

33:22.855 --> 33:24.088
What's going on?
It's all right.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.824
Why don't you take her
in the other room.

33:25.825 --> 33:27.292
She's going to be all right.
No...

33:27.293 --> 33:28.760
Elaine, sweetheart,
come on. It's okay.

33:28.761 --> 33:30.478
Shh, shh.
It's all right.

33:30.479 --> 33:32.030
Come on. Let's take this

33:32.031 --> 33:34.232
back to the beginning,
all right?

33:35.768 --> 33:37.802
It looks like they're
in some abandoned factory.

33:37.803 --> 33:38.903
Yeah.

33:38.904 --> 33:40.271
All right.

33:40.272 --> 33:42.073
Roll it nice and slow.
Frame by frame.

33:42.074 --> 33:43.741
You see the windows there?

33:43.742 --> 33:45.510
They're washed out
from the, uh,

33:45.511 --> 33:47.045
the light
in the background there.

33:47.046 --> 33:49.414
Try to get a shot of one of the
windows, okay? Just the window.

33:49.415 --> 33:52.150
Right there. Right there. Stop.

33:52.151 --> 33:53.751
Okay, just darken
the background

33:53.752 --> 33:55.019
a little bit.
There you go.

33:55.020 --> 33:57.188
All right.

33:58.324 --> 34:00.875
Zoom in a little bit.

34:00.876 --> 34:02.861
That's the, uh...

34:02.862 --> 34:04.829
That's the Gates Avenue Armory,
isn't it?

34:04.830 --> 34:06.998
Yeah, I think
that's the south side. So...

34:06.999 --> 34:09.333
This must have been shot
from East New York.

34:09.335 --> 34:10.969
East New York is
where we found the kidnap van.

34:10.969 --> 34:12.237
Mm-hmm.

34:14.106 --> 34:16.274
So that would be Taze.

34:25.050 --> 34:26.618
Shut up.

34:26.619 --> 34:28.518
Shut up!

34:28.520 --> 34:30.205
Or I'll kill you now.

34:30.206 --> 34:31.989
Rich little bitch like you.

34:35.411 --> 34:36.744
Rich girl like you,

34:36.745 --> 34:40.031
got no idea how hard it is.

34:40.032 --> 34:42.065
How hard I had it.

34:50.009 --> 34:51.708
I'm gonna be a new man,

34:51.710 --> 34:54.012
a rich man.

35:09.995 --> 35:13.498
Hey, Taze, drop the weapon
and step away from the girl!

35:14.700 --> 35:15.917
I said, drop the weapon

35:15.918 --> 35:17.168
and step away

35:17.169 --> 35:18.703
from the girl!

35:18.704 --> 35:19.704
Right now!

35:19.705 --> 35:22.073
You got nowhere
to go, Taze!

35:22.074 --> 35:23.958
Nice and easy.

35:23.959 --> 35:25.410
No where to go?

35:25.411 --> 35:27.462
That's it.
All this is for me?

35:27.463 --> 35:30.581
Take it easy.
For me?

35:30.582 --> 35:32.717
Take it easy. Step to the side.

35:34.653 --> 35:36.253
I said, step aside!

35:36.254 --> 35:38.456
All right.

35:41.760 --> 35:44.929
Hey! Hey!

35:48.400 --> 35:50.034
Move in, move in, move in.

35:50.035 --> 35:51.069
He's down. Let's go.

35:51.070 --> 35:52.269
Perp is down.
Check him out.

35:52.270 --> 35:54.455
Okay, okay.

35:54.456 --> 35:56.273
It's okay.

35:56.274 --> 35:57.342
It's okay. It's okay.

35:57.343 --> 35:58.793
I'm sorry.
It's all right.

35:58.794 --> 36:01.212
I'm so sorry.

36:01.964 --> 36:03.164
Is he gone?
Yeah.

36:03.165 --> 36:04.582
Get EMTs in there now.

36:04.583 --> 36:06.217
I'm sorry!

36:10.990 --> 36:13.491
It was my idea.

36:13.492 --> 36:17.528
Drew said he would help me
because he loved me so much.

36:17.529 --> 36:20.898
He was just supposed
to kidnap me,

36:20.899 --> 36:23.468
but then we realized we needed

36:23.469 --> 36:25.203
someone else to drive the car.

36:25.204 --> 36:26.704
Taze?

36:28.307 --> 36:30.141
And you guys paid him?

36:31.010 --> 36:33.411
A hundred bucks.

36:34.747 --> 36:38.182
We said good-bye to him
when we dumped the car.

36:41.553 --> 36:43.921
But then he heard
about the diamonds,

36:43.922 --> 36:47.025
and he came...

36:47.026 --> 36:49.260
he came to Drew's apartment

36:49.261 --> 36:50.995
with a gun

36:50.996 --> 36:53.464
and...

36:53.465 --> 36:56.000
said he was going to kill me

36:56.001 --> 36:58.870
if Drew didn't
split the ransom.

37:00.773 --> 37:02.807
Drew tried to

37:02.808 --> 37:05.009
protect me.

37:05.010 --> 37:08.112
And Taze shot him.

37:09.748 --> 37:11.616
There wasn't going
to be anything

37:11.617 --> 37:13.818
to split with him, anyway.
We were going to...

37:13.819 --> 37:15.203
We were going
to put the diamonds

37:15.204 --> 37:16.821
in a safe deposit box,

37:16.822 --> 37:18.656
and then I was going
to show up

37:18.657 --> 37:20.992
at my dad's house
like someone dropped me off.

37:20.993 --> 37:22.126
So you weren't

37:22.127 --> 37:24.262
going to cash in on these
diamonds and run away?

37:26.031 --> 37:28.132
Then why did you do it, Chloe?

37:33.439 --> 37:34.939
I don't know.

37:36.608 --> 37:38.676
Come on, Chloe.

37:41.046 --> 37:43.247
I thought maybe...

37:44.917 --> 37:48.352
...maybe Mom and Dad
would be so...

37:48.353 --> 37:52.356
would be so worried
about me,

37:53.625 --> 37:56.661
maybe Mom would...

37:56.662 --> 38:00.298
stop being mad-mad at Dad

38:00.299 --> 38:02.750
and it would bring them
back together again.

38:12.744 --> 38:15.246
Sit tight.

38:16.148 --> 38:18.116
Come on.

38:19.918 --> 38:20.968
Sweetheart.

38:20.969 --> 38:23.221
Mom!

38:23.222 --> 38:24.605
Daddy!

38:25.441 --> 38:27.091
Okay.

38:32.698 --> 38:34.699
Incredible.

38:34.700 --> 38:36.600
Yeah.

38:36.601 --> 38:39.537
Looks like her cockamamy plan
might actually work.

38:39.538 --> 38:41.405
Stupid kid.

38:52.017 --> 38:54.018
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

38:54.019 --> 38:55.686
Can I come in?

38:55.687 --> 38:57.421
"Can I come in" who?

38:59.758 --> 39:02.176
I'm trying to be serious.

39:02.177 --> 39:04.662
Uh-oh.

39:04.663 --> 39:07.231
I'm, um...

39:07.232 --> 39:09.333
I'm sorry it's so late notice,

39:09.334 --> 39:10.535
but you've been out
of the office all day.

39:10.536 --> 39:13.237
You found out about tonight.

39:13.238 --> 39:16.040
Now, that Nicky, she's
a persuasive kid.

39:16.041 --> 39:17.408
Not that it took a
lot of persuading.

39:17.409 --> 39:20.044
She should never have put you
in that position.

39:20.045 --> 39:21.279
What did I just say?

39:21.280 --> 39:22.647
It wasn't exactly a hard sell.

39:22.648 --> 39:25.316
Right. But you know it would...

39:26.451 --> 39:28.352
You know it's a bad idea.

39:28.353 --> 39:30.054
Because I'm your boss?

39:30.055 --> 39:31.506
All right. You know,

39:31.507 --> 39:34.625
I won't be your boss
if I get elected mayor.

39:34.626 --> 39:36.660
And then you fire my father.

39:36.661 --> 39:38.629
Who says I'd do that?

39:39.765 --> 39:41.465
Okay, well, even if you didn't,

39:41.466 --> 39:42.667
and we were an item,

39:42.668 --> 39:44.769
how do you think
that it would look?

39:44.770 --> 39:46.337
Come on, Reagan, loosen up.

39:46.338 --> 39:48.839
Politics and government--
they're incestuous by nature.

39:48.840 --> 39:50.841
I'm sorry.
You know, I think,

39:50.842 --> 39:52.777
for Nicky, she got
ahead of herself,

39:52.778 --> 39:53.945
and she's not
really ready...

39:53.946 --> 39:54.979
Hey.

39:54.980 --> 39:56.948
It's Valentine's Day.

39:56.949 --> 39:59.884
Your daughter made us a
nice dinner reservation.

39:59.885 --> 40:02.153
I put on my
lucky purple tie.

40:04.122 --> 40:06.657
I'm sorry.

40:06.658 --> 40:09.460
I have other plans.

40:10.295 --> 40:12.029
Oh.

40:12.030 --> 40:13.864
Okay.

40:13.865 --> 40:15.533
Um...

40:15.534 --> 40:16.867
Good night.

40:16.868 --> 40:18.769
It would have been fun.

40:18.770 --> 40:20.972
Yeah.

40:34.920 --> 40:36.454
Detective Ryan.

40:36.455 --> 40:39.924
Sir, I decided to look further
into the Saldana case,

40:39.925 --> 40:41.959
and I asked Transit
Special Investigations

40:41.960 --> 40:44.395
to run the MetroCard
in his possession,

40:44.396 --> 40:46.697
check his whereabouts
that night.

40:46.698 --> 40:47.798
That's not something

40:47.799 --> 40:49.834
an arresting officer
would normally do.

40:49.835 --> 40:51.969
Although, hopefully, a good
defense attorney would.

40:51.970 --> 40:54.238
What do you think?

40:54.239 --> 40:57.241
Well, Saldana used his MetroCard

40:57.242 --> 41:00.111
at the Nevins station
in Brooklyn at 20:30 hours.

41:00.112 --> 41:03.180
Which means that he would have
been on the six train

41:03.181 --> 41:04.515
at the time of the robbery.

41:04.516 --> 41:07.051
I also asked them to run
the victim's credit cards

41:07.052 --> 41:08.619
While Eddie was in custody,

41:08.620 --> 41:10.921
somebody else
was making charges.

41:10.922 --> 41:13.257
That's good work, Detective.

41:13.258 --> 41:15.092
You know,
it's as important to work hard

41:15.093 --> 41:16.994
to exonerate an innocent victim

41:16.995 --> 41:18.929
as it is
to convict a guilty one.

41:18.930 --> 41:20.197
Well, that being said,
you still have

41:20.198 --> 41:21.532
an armed robber at large

41:21.533 --> 41:22.984
in your precinct.

41:22.985 --> 41:24.702
I'm on it, sir.

41:29.658 --> 41:32.159
Good night, Inez.

41:32.160 --> 41:34.745
Good night.
Commissioner?

41:36.715 --> 41:40.518
You should know my son Eddie
was released this afternoon

41:40.519 --> 41:43.087
and the charges
were dropped against him.

41:43.889 --> 41:46.157
Always nice
to hear good news.

41:46.158 --> 41:48.326
Happy Valentine's Day.

41:48.327 --> 41:50.594
Same to you, Inez.

41:59.204 --> 42:02.156
Hi. Reservation for two,
under Boyle.

42:02.157 --> 42:04.308
Nicky Boyle.

42:11.850 --> 42:12.883
Here's our girl.

42:12.884 --> 42:14.168
Hey!

42:14.169 --> 42:15.986
Hey.
Hey.

42:15.987 --> 42:17.988
Happy Valentine's Day, Mom.

42:17.989 --> 42:19.056
What is this?

42:19.057 --> 42:21.625
A meeting of the
Lonely Hearts Club.

42:22.878 --> 42:24.595
Otherwise known
as the Reagan family.

42:24.596 --> 42:28.132
Well, what a nice surprise.

42:28.133 --> 42:29.433
We thought so.

42:31.470 --> 42:32.903
This is very romantic.

42:32.904 --> 42:34.004
Not.

42:35.207 --> 42:36.474
Five unattached Reagans.

42:36.475 --> 42:38.442
I don't know what
to say about that.

42:39.378 --> 42:40.845
Better luck next year?

42:40.846 --> 42:42.179
Yeah.

42:43.315 --> 42:44.715
To better luck next year.

42:44.716 --> 42:46.317
- To better luck next year.
- Better luck next year.

42:46.318 --> 42:47.585
Better luck next year.

42:47.586 --> 42:48.786
Hey. Ho.
