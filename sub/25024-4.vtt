00:52.844 --> 00:54.846
Feeling better?

00:54.929 --> 00:57.891
So much better.
I feel like I slept for 100 hours.

00:57.974 --> 00:58.850
Right.

00:58.933 --> 01:03.104
And you weren't joyriding around town
with your staff again?

01:03.188 --> 01:06.024
-"Joyriding"?
-You left it laying around last night.

01:06.107 --> 01:09.652
-Weird. I always keep it in here.
-I gots proof.

01:09.736 --> 01:14.866
Mr. Beary McBearface saw the whole thing.
Turns out he's a Nanny Cam.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.701
-[toy squeaks]
-Found out on accident.

01:16.785 --> 01:20.121
I had to, uh, ahem--
erase a lot of footage.

01:21.122 --> 01:24.876
This looks like a direct-to-video sequel.
But it's real.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.511
[Claire gasps]

01:35.178 --> 01:36.429
[silent]

01:38.473 --> 01:40.141
I don't remember doing any of that.

01:40.225 --> 01:43.102
I can't deal with this.
I gotta go to school.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.189
[gasps, sighs]

01:48.525 --> 01:49.359

02:28.523 --> 02:29.858
[bell ringing]

02:30.483 --> 02:34.362
Looks like everything's back to normal.
Speaking of totally normal things,

02:34.445 --> 02:36.489
what's going on
with Gunmar's Trollpocalypse?

02:36.573 --> 02:39.868
Blinky says we can't throw a wrench
in his plan till we know what it is,

02:39.951 --> 02:42.871
but Aaarrrgghh!!! thinks he's close
to uncovering something.

02:44.414 --> 02:45.874
Claire! You're back!

02:45.957 --> 02:47.542
-Feeling better?
-We gotta talk.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.044
Did you remember
how someone stole the election signs

02:50.128 --> 02:53.172
protecting the warehouse?
I think I know who took them.

02:53.256 --> 02:56.050
-The night the Gumm-Gumms attacked?
-Claire! You're back!

02:56.134 --> 02:59.345
-You're not sick anymore, right?
-Nope.

02:59.429 --> 03:04.142
Awesome! That was one killer cold. [gasps]
We gotta celebrate now that you're back.

03:04.225 --> 03:07.395
-Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
-[both] Double date!

03:07.478 --> 03:10.315
-If Claire's up for it, I am.
-[chuckles]

03:10.398 --> 03:12.233
Yeah. It'll be good to get out.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.028
-See you guys tonight.
-I'll catch up with you.

03:15.612 --> 03:16.487
[yelps]

03:16.571 --> 03:19.157
-What are you doing?
-Keeping an eye on you.

03:19.240 --> 03:23.745
Do you think a date is such a good idea,
what with all your weirdness going on?

03:23.828 --> 03:27.415
-It was probably just sleepwalking.
-Sleepwalking? I don't know.

03:27.498 --> 03:31.544
Thanks for looking out for me,
but I'm fine. Now stay out of sight.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.504
-[bangs]
-[grunting]

03:34.547 --> 03:36.758
I think it's a good idea, Tobes.

03:36.841 --> 03:39.385
It'll be nice to have a night
free from imminent danger.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.888
Never underestimate
the danger of a double date.

03:41.971 --> 03:42.805
[grunts]

03:42.889 --> 03:45.808
One wrong move and they will...
[grunts] dump us!

03:45.892 --> 03:47.101
-[bones crack]
-[grunts]

03:47.185 --> 03:50.980
Tobes, relax. I think
you're being a little overdramatic.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.398
Relax? [chuckles]

03:52.482 --> 03:56.277
I'm relaxed.
I'm a total dating guru. [grunts]

03:56.361 --> 03:57.195
Ouch!

03:57.278 --> 03:58.988
[Coach Lawrence] Pepperjack, get up!

03:59.072 --> 04:01.824
It's okay. I know this is your first date.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.577
What? Darci and I went
on a date last Tuesday.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.080
[grunts] I'm nervous
because this is your first date.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.998
-[bell clangs]
-Claire and I had lots of dates.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.959
Trollhunting missions don't count, Jimbo.

04:11.042 --> 04:14.963
[grunts] What about when we kissed
on the bluff during Spring Fling?

04:15.046 --> 04:17.839
You almost kissed,
 then you ran off to fight Angor Rot.

04:17.923 --> 04:20.385
-Trollhunting mission.
-I went to her barbecue.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.470
And you fought your own clones.
[grunts]

04:22.553 --> 04:25.181
Darci will be there,
so you two can't talk about trolls.

04:25.265 --> 04:29.936
What else are you gonna talk about?
Promise me this. No Spanish, all right?

04:30.019 --> 04:32.730
You talk in Spanish
when you get nervous around Claire.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.900
-Okay. What's your plan?
-Keep it classic. Dinner and a movie.

04:35.984 --> 04:40.446
We just need to follow
my three golden rules of love hunting.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.532
I already hate where this is going.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.659
Number one-- the art of conversation.

04:44.742 --> 04:47.036
Pull inspiration from what's around you.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.748
Her hair, the food, ze ambiance.

04:51.666 --> 04:52.500
Ahem.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.586
Oh, hello. How did I not see you there?

04:55.670 --> 04:57.755
Your dimples are so exquisite

04:57.839 --> 05:02.510
and your skin is so radiant and orange.
Have you been to the beach?

05:03.303 --> 05:06.139
-You try.
-Uh... hi?

05:06.222 --> 05:09.100
Your head's so... [chuckles] round.

05:09.183 --> 05:13.521
You look like you're... having a ball.
[chuckles]

05:13.604 --> 05:15.189
Muy hermosa!

05:15.273 --> 05:16.399
No Spanish!

05:16.482 --> 05:18.901
Now, number two. Physical contact.

05:18.985 --> 05:22.030
This is where the movie comes in.
Specifically, a scary one.

05:22.113 --> 05:25.491
It's why I picked Danger House 2:
More House, More Danger.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.576
Ahem.

05:27.785 --> 05:31.122
[imitating Darci] "Ooh! Oh!
I can't look! It's so scary!

05:31.205 --> 05:34.167
Hold me close.
Tell me when it's safe to look."

05:34.250 --> 05:36.294
And most importantly, rule number three.

05:36.377 --> 05:39.547
Above all else, never let them go
to the bathroom together.

05:39.630 --> 05:40.465
Why not?

05:40.548 --> 05:43.384
"Why not?" Girls don't pee, they conspire!

05:43.468 --> 05:46.512
They'll talk about us
and that's when things will go south.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.433
Then, if all goes well,

05:50.516 --> 05:54.562
when we walk 'em home,
we'll seal the night with a kiss.

05:55.646 --> 05:56.898
Uh...

05:58.316 --> 05:59.317
[whistle blows]

05:59.400 --> 06:02.737
I told you, Domzalski!
Quit making out with the equipment.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.822
-[chuckles]
-[classmates laughing]

06:07.241 --> 06:12.371
[Queen Usurna] Our Dark Lord
has returned from his journey!

06:12.455 --> 06:14.665
My loyal followers,

06:14.749 --> 06:18.336
I have traveled far
and have returned with the answer

06:18.419 --> 06:23.883
on how to bring forth our Eternal Night.
The Staff of Avalon.

06:23.966 --> 06:24.967
[grunts]

06:26.719 --> 06:32.558
My trusted advisor
must have seen this coming.

06:32.642 --> 06:38.981
For he says the Pale Lady
speaks through him in visions.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.525
Obviously, Milord.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.360
The Staff of Avalon.

06:42.443 --> 06:48.407
Merlin's staff came to me in a dream.
A relic of great power.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.992
[growls] Liar!

06:50.076 --> 06:52.161
[whimpers]

06:52.245 --> 06:55.248
I spoke to the Pale Lady.

06:55.331 --> 06:58.709
She told me who you truly are.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.462
-A fraud!
-Oh, please, Gunmar.

07:01.546 --> 07:05.216
After everything we've been through.
I stayed by your side.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.718
-I betrayed my kind.
-Meaningless!

07:07.802 --> 07:10.638
I know-- I know how to find the Staff!

07:10.721 --> 07:11.973
[growls]

07:13.641 --> 07:14.642
[whimpers]

07:14.725 --> 07:15.810
[growls]

07:15.893 --> 07:17.478
No! Please!

07:17.562 --> 07:20.648
-Usurna? Usurna!
-Traitor!

07:20.731 --> 07:24.902
You have earned your just re-- [grunts]

07:24.986 --> 07:26.487
[roars]

07:28.489 --> 07:29.740
[growls]

07:30.575 --> 07:32.368
[snarls]

07:32.452 --> 07:35.455
Aaarrrgghh!!! After him!

07:43.504 --> 07:45.131
[grunts]

07:48.092 --> 07:49.010
[engine stops]

07:52.096 --> 07:54.515
Right. [sighs] Okay.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.185
[inhales]

07:58.394 --> 07:59.812
-Courage.
-[raps on door]

08:01.522 --> 08:03.649
[neighbor] Not tonight, honey.
Maybe tomorrow.

08:03.733 --> 08:04.984
[switch clicks]

08:05.234 --> 08:07.612
-[gasps] Walt?
-Barbara.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.531
I'm not sure what exactly came over me,

08:10.615 --> 08:13.367
but I woke up and had to see you.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.954
I know it's been a long time!

08:17.288 --> 08:18.122
[sighs]

08:18.706 --> 08:22.793
I know I ran off unexpectedly.

08:22.877 --> 08:27.757
And I don't know where I found
the courage to knock on your--

08:27.840 --> 08:28.841
-[slams]
-[grunts]

08:29.842 --> 08:31.260

08:32.636 --> 08:35.722
-[sighs]
-[distant dog barking]

08:38.017 --> 08:41.312
[sighs] He came back.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.734
[Darci] Mary texted me,
like, "We're back together."

08:46.817 --> 08:48.653
Tight Jeans Hank? Again?

08:48.736 --> 08:51.906
A beautiful night.
Just like my beautiful gal.

08:51.989 --> 08:52.823
Shall we?

08:54.283 --> 08:55.201
-Hmm.
-[chuckles]

08:56.911 --> 09:00.206
-[grunts] Ow!
-Huh! Oops! Sorry!

09:01.374 --> 09:02.208
[chuckles]

09:03.251 --> 09:04.544
-Hmm.
-Uh...

09:05.169 --> 09:06.003
[chuckles]

09:06.671 --> 09:08.339
-Ha. Uh...
-[chair screeches]

09:09.590 --> 09:10.466
Ooh.

09:10.550 --> 09:14.136
I heard the duck confit is stellar.
I think I'll get that.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.848
Same!
OMG, when I went to Paris with the fam,

09:17.932 --> 09:19.976
the duck was amazing.

09:20.059 --> 09:23.688
[in French accent]
Ah, Paree! Zee city of love.

09:23.771 --> 09:24.772
[softly] Tell me more.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.191
[sighs] Paris sounds so nice.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.402
I've only been to Mexico
to visit my abuelita.

09:29.485 --> 09:30.861
Ah, México.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.780
-[Toby] Ahem.
-[Jim] Ow! Ow!

09:32.863 --> 09:35.408
How often do you think
they wash these awnings?

09:35.491 --> 09:36.325
Uh...

09:36.409 --> 09:38.953
-Because Parisians love me.
-[chuckling]

09:39.036 --> 09:41.789
-What can I say? I'm fabulous.
-[smooches]

09:41.872 --> 09:46.168
Ahem. So, Claire,
you saw the first Danger House, right?

09:46.252 --> 09:48.296
-There's a deep lore.
-I haven't.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.006
OMG! Where do I start? So...

09:50.089 --> 09:52.258
-You promised no Spanish.
-[bangs table]

09:52.341 --> 09:53.551
Tobes, calm down.

09:53.634 --> 09:56.887
It was a natural part of the conversation.
The date's going well.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.056
Oh, no. Code Red! Code Red!

10:01.100 --> 10:02.643
He's our waiter?

10:02.727 --> 10:05.980
Gentlemen, ladies,
what can I get for you today?

10:06.063 --> 10:07.398
Oh, Claire, is it?

10:07.481 --> 10:09.900
Have you been rehearsing
for Battle of the Bands?

10:09.984 --> 10:12.361
Yep!
Feeling pretty good about our chances.

10:12.445 --> 10:16.699
[chuckles] Don't fraternize
with the competition. Okay, level with me.

10:16.782 --> 10:20.536
The duck confit,
are duck feet really that good?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.997
[distorted]
Actually, Duck confit is a French dish

10:23.080 --> 10:24.332
made with the whole duck...

10:24.415 --> 10:25.625
-[grunts]
-[Toby] Jim!

10:25.708 --> 10:28.586
Jim! Stop him before he charms Darci too.

10:28.669 --> 10:32.173
Steaks all around. Thank you, Deuce.
I'm sure you're busy.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.424
An excellent choice.

10:33.507 --> 10:35.843
Now, how would you like
your steak prepared?

10:35.926 --> 10:36.802
Well done.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.638
-Well done?
-Yeah, what he's having.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.557
[Morgana's voice growls]
Raw! Dripping with blood! [gasps]

10:41.641 --> 10:43.225
-[chuckles]
-Uh...

10:43.309 --> 10:46.854
As the lady wishes. Four steaks.

10:46.937 --> 10:49.440
One raw. Dripping with blood.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.984
Uh, Darc, bathroom?

10:52.777 --> 10:54.362
Ah! Rule three! Rule three!

10:54.445 --> 10:55.821
-Huh?
-[grunts]

10:55.905 --> 10:57.823
[whimpers] The other rule three.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.701
-TP! Are you okay? What happened?
-[groaning]

11:00.785 --> 11:03.412
-Claire, go on without me.
-[moans]

11:06.457 --> 11:08.793
Come on. Pull it together, Claire.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.504
[sighs]

11:15.508 --> 11:16.342
[sighs]

11:17.176 --> 11:18.677
Uh...

11:21.180 --> 11:23.349
-[Morgana] Hello, darling.
-[gasps]

11:23.432 --> 11:27.812
-Claire, is it?
-This is not real.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.980
-[chuckles] Sorry, dear.
-Agh!

11:30.064 --> 11:33.192
-Did I scare you?
-[panting] This isn't real.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.695
I'm imagining this.

11:36.779 --> 11:37.863
[grunts]

11:39.365 --> 11:40.491
[screams]

11:40.574 --> 11:43.994
You think I'm just a reflection
you can run away from?

11:44.078 --> 11:45.454
I'm under your skin.

11:45.538 --> 11:49.458
[panting] Get out of me!

11:49.542 --> 11:51.419
You're only hurting yourself.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.170
Who are you?

11:53.254 --> 11:55.548
I have many names.

11:55.631 --> 11:59.844
You can call me Morgana. [laughs]

11:59.927 --> 12:03.514
Stop it! [grunts] Get out of me!

12:05.266 --> 12:07.977
-[grunts]
-My, you are strong.

12:08.060 --> 12:12.940
Strong enough to wield my weapon.
Strong enough to be my gracious host.

12:13.023 --> 12:17.236
You open up a big enough door,
something's bound to escape.

12:17.319 --> 12:21.323
The portal, the sickness,
the signs under my bed.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.452
You've already told Gunmar
all he needs to know

12:24.535 --> 12:29.498
but since I'm out and about,
I thought we'd kill Merlin's Trollhunter,

12:29.582 --> 12:33.043
as soon as we get him alone. [cackling]

12:33.127 --> 12:34.670
[shrieking]

12:37.882 --> 12:39.884
[panting]

12:40.342 --> 12:41.177
[NotEnrique] Oi!

12:41.260 --> 12:44.680
 You don't look so good. Oi! Me scruff!

12:44.763 --> 12:49.143
[Morgana] What a brave little mongrel.
How sweet and stupid.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.313
-[door creaking]
-[grunts]

12:53.272 --> 12:55.274
[grunting]

12:56.400 --> 12:58.194
-[light switch clicks]
-[Darci] Claire?

12:59.695 --> 13:01.864
You feeling all right, Claire Bear?

13:02.239 --> 13:03.824
Hmm? [gasps]

13:03.908 --> 13:07.244
[grunting, coughing]

13:07.328 --> 13:09.497
I don't feel like myself tonight.

13:11.916 --> 13:16.629
-[chuckles] So, um, did we miss anything?
-You tell us.

13:16.712 --> 13:20.925
What did you talk about in the bathroom?
Did you talk about us? Are we still good?

13:21.008 --> 13:24.803
Yeah, wait, what? I was gone
for, like, negative two seconds.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.973
-Felt longer. Felt a lot longer.
-[Darci] Uh... yikes!

13:28.057 --> 13:29.266
Huh! Feeling better?

13:30.226 --> 13:33.646
[chuckles] I feel like a whole new girl.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.314
[chuckles]

13:35.397 --> 13:37.399
-[chuckles maniacally]
-Huh...

13:38.234 --> 13:40.236
Uh... [grunts]

13:43.030 --> 13:44.156
-No...
-[gasps]

13:44.782 --> 13:45.616
[shrieks]

13:46.200 --> 13:48.536
-[Morgana laughing]
-[Toby, Jim] Uh...

13:49.453 --> 13:51.705
[distorted voice] Oops! Butterfingers.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.333
Your voice.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.043
[coughing]

13:57.294 --> 13:59.838
[normal voice]
Oh, I think my cold has returned.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.841
-But not to worry.
-Not to worry?

14:03.425 --> 14:05.970
Is Claire acting weird?

14:06.053 --> 14:09.098
It's called flirting, Jimbo.
She's totally into you.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.100
She's giving you the eyes.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.312
Here we are. Four steaks, rare.

14:15.396 --> 14:18.190
But I'd love to hear your band sometime.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.567
Be gone, servant.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.361
Oh. My apologies.

14:22.444 --> 14:25.239
[chuckles] You heard the lady. Hmm.

14:25.823 --> 14:26.657
Whew.

14:26.740 --> 14:30.786
-So, um... should we eat?
-[chuckles]

14:30.870 --> 14:32.037
-[Claire growls]
-[gasps]

14:34.540 --> 14:35.541
[clatters]

14:37.001 --> 14:37.835
Mmm. [slurps]

14:39.003 --> 14:41.005
[Darci] Well, um...

14:41.088 --> 14:43.924
that was an interesting dinner.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.802
Never saw someone harf down
a raw steak like that before.

14:49.889 --> 14:50.890
[chuckles]

14:59.732 --> 15:04.028
Oh, your hand feels really cold.
Are you sure you're up for a movie?

15:06.530 --> 15:08.365
-[snarls]
-[hisses]

15:08.449 --> 15:09.283
[meows]

15:09.366 --> 15:11.869
We should go somewhere else.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.914
-Perhaps you should take me home.
-[gasps] Great idea!

15:14.997 --> 15:16.957
Walk her home!
Darc and I'll see you tomorrow!

15:17.041 --> 15:19.877
[Jim] Oh, uh... 'kay. Bye, Tobes!

15:19.960 --> 15:22.379
Are you coming, little lamb?

15:22.463 --> 15:26.300
"Little lamb"?
Sure, but your house is that way.

15:26.383 --> 15:29.845
-I know. We'll have to walk.
-[grunts]

15:29.929 --> 15:33.015
-I left my Skathe-Hrün at home.
-Your what?

15:35.142 --> 15:39.021
Oh. Your Shadow Staff.
I've never heard you call it that before.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.273
-Quickly now.
-A walk sounds nice--!

15:43.108 --> 15:47.071
-[Gumm-Gumms grunting]
-Find them! They can't have gone far.

15:47.154 --> 15:49.698
Milord, the guards
have searched everywhere.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.201
Neither Aaarrrgghh!!! nor Dictatious
are to be found.

15:52.284 --> 15:56.455
And why did Dictatious cry for your help?
What have you been plotting?

15:56.538 --> 15:59.875
I do not know
why that blind fool called for me.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.920
It must have merely been
a last act of desperation.

16:03.003 --> 16:07.132
Did the Eldritch Queen tell you
how we will vanquish the Trollhunter?

16:07.216 --> 16:09.969
We will need the Staff of Avalon.

16:10.052 --> 16:13.138
And her faithful servant will aid us
in our quest.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.017
-Who is that?
-[growls]

16:18.060 --> 16:20.980
[gasps] Hmm.

16:22.731 --> 16:23.565
[growls]

16:24.316 --> 16:26.026
[growls]

16:28.362 --> 16:34.952
[growls] Angor Rot. You shall rise again.

16:35.536 --> 16:36.954
[grunts]

16:40.541 --> 16:41.542
[clinks]

16:44.461 --> 16:45.462
[snarls]

16:48.757 --> 16:50.592
[gasps, grunts]

16:52.428 --> 16:55.848
-Follow stairs. Find Blinky.
-You're not coming with me?

16:55.931 --> 16:57.891
I distract. You escape.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.686
But why? Why would you save me?

17:00.769 --> 17:04.189
You say big words.
Tell Blinky about Angor Rot. [grunts]

17:05.107 --> 17:07.192
[roars, grunts]

17:09.278 --> 17:10.445
Oh. Oh...

17:10.529 --> 17:13.031
[panting, roars]

17:16.410 --> 17:17.243
[panting]

17:18.328 --> 17:19.288
After him!

17:21.790 --> 17:23.625

17:56.533 --> 17:59.078
[both grunting]

17:59.161 --> 18:02.873
The Pale Lady
has a plan for you too, Aaarrrgghh!!!

18:02.956 --> 18:04.249
You can't escape!

18:04.333 --> 18:06.085
[both grunt]

18:09.004 --> 18:13.675
Don't you see?
You're all players in a greater game!

18:13.759 --> 18:15.803
Fighting is futile!

18:19.181 --> 18:20.099
[bangs]

18:28.690 --> 18:30.442
[chain rattles]

18:34.279 --> 18:38.575
I need him alive... for now.

18:38.659 --> 18:41.286
I have plans for you.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.748
-[Gunmar's laughter echoes]
-Oh.

18:45.707 --> 18:46.708
Oh. Oh--!

18:51.171 --> 18:54.633
-Are your parents away?
-Gone for the weekend.

18:54.716 --> 18:59.096
Oh. Well, I can stay
and make you some hot soup or--

18:59.179 --> 19:02.683
Sit. I'll be back down in a minute.

19:03.684 --> 19:04.518
Hmm!

19:06.979 --> 19:10.941
-[woman on TV] It's our dream house.
-Oh, first Danger House.

19:11.024 --> 19:13.277
-[man] Don't go in that house!
-This could work.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.154
-It's dangerous!
-Classic Danger House.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.239
[creaking]

19:19.992 --> 19:21.702

19:24.413 --> 19:25.706
[woman screams on TV]

19:26.498 --> 19:28.876
Richard! Richard, where'd you go?
Richard?

19:28.959 --> 19:30.002
Look behind you.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.087
-Richard?
-Look behind you!

19:32.171 --> 19:33.255
Where are you, Richard?

19:35.048 --> 19:37.801
-Where'd you go, Richard?
-Don't be stupid, look behind you!

19:38.677 --> 19:40.387
-[woman screams]
-[Jim screams]

19:40.470 --> 19:43.599
-Ah! What are you doing?
-Trying to kill you.

19:45.017 --> 19:45.851
[grunts]

19:45.934 --> 19:49.646
I thought the date was going well!
Claire, what's going on?

19:49.730 --> 19:51.815
There is no Claire.

19:53.775 --> 19:57.029
I am Morgana!

19:57.112 --> 19:58.322
[coughs] Who?

19:59.114 --> 20:02.201
The Eldritch Queen. Baba Yaga.

20:02.284 --> 20:05.871
The Pale Lady. Ugh, I have many names!

20:05.954 --> 20:07.789
Sorry, still drawing a blank.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.834
[distorted] I am your doom--

20:12.211 --> 20:17.216

but you have to take it down a notch.

20:34.983 --> 20:38.820
Drooma katorth-a myntarth-a klar.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.280
Sorry about this, but...

20:40.364 --> 20:43.617
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command.

20:43.700 --> 20:47.412
Drooma katorth-a myntarth-a klar.

20:47.496 --> 20:48.580
Whoa!

20:48.664 --> 20:52.251
Drooma katorth-a myntarth-a klar.

20:52.334 --> 20:55.963
Claire, if you're seeing this,
I did not mess up your house again.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.631
-[screams]
-Whoa!

21:04.096 --> 21:05.138

[cackling]

21:23.240 --> 21:24.825

21:24.908 --> 21:26.660
You think I'm powerful now,

21:26.743 --> 21:31.873
just wait until the Eternal Night
frees me from my prison!

21:34.209 --> 21:36.003

Claire! If you're in there,
do something! Anything!

21:48.056 --> 21:50.100
Claire is not here!

21:50.183 --> 21:52.269
No, but her brother is!

-She called herself Morgana. Who is that?
-Uh...

22:09.536 --> 22:12.205
Not somebody you want to date.
