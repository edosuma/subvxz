The grouse is a large game bird

01:48.073 --> 01:51.456

The birds are on the ground

02:35.983 --> 02:39.504
We're near the bear
migration route.

02:39.538 --> 02:42.748
The bears are migrating
toward salmon streams,

02:42.783 --> 02:45.820
and they'll move
along the foothills.

02:45.855 --> 02:49.272
Narrator: Alaska is home
to more than 100,000 bears,

03:16.023 --> 03:17.818
and they're very strong
and very fast

03:17.852 --> 03:21.131

do make this
a good situation.

13:37.575 --> 13:39.888
Mary has dolled up
the place nice.

13:39.922 --> 13:41.268
River has been great.

13:41.303 --> 13:42.960
Everybody has been
putting forward,

13:42.994 --> 13:46.170
but still, living in a tent,
it wears on you.

13:46.204 --> 13:47.757
We're ready to land somewhere.

13:47.792 --> 13:50.484
Narrator:
Of the seven pieces of property
Jason and Mary Hawk

13:50.519 --> 13:52.762
have seen in the last 3 months,

13:52.797 --> 13:54.316
only one met the requirements

13:54.350 --> 13:56.974
they need to build
a secure homestead,

13:57.008 --> 13:59.735
and they lost it
to a higher bidder.

13:59.769 --> 14:02.600
Today, they're scouting
a modest tract of land

14:02.634 --> 14:04.567
20 miles up the road.

14:04.602 --> 14:08.571
It's only 10 acres,
but 10 acres means smaller,

14:08.606 --> 14:10.090
means the price is better.

14:10.125 --> 14:13.300
As much as I'm ready
to get out of the tent,

14:13.335 --> 14:14.784
I know that, you know,

14:14.819 --> 14:16.752
it's really important
we find the right place.

14:16.786 --> 14:18.823
We can't
compromise on this.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.446
Jason: I hear you.

14:21.481 --> 14:23.379
Jason: We've looked at a ton
of properties

14:23.414 --> 14:26.210
since we've been back here.

14:26.244 --> 14:29.351
Some of them, honestly,
weren't that memorable.

14:29.385 --> 14:31.940
You pulled up, don't even have
to go down the driveway and go,

14:31.974 --> 14:35.805
"Nope, that's not it."

14:35.840 --> 14:38.705
Mary:
I really hope this one works.

14:38.739 --> 14:41.708
All these other ones
have been such disappointments.

14:41.742 --> 14:45.677
Jason: That, my darling,
is an understatement.

14:45.712 --> 14:47.231
I think this is it.

14:47.265 --> 14:50.890
Mary: This is it?

14:50.924 --> 14:52.374
Jason: It's looking nice.

14:52.408 --> 14:58.414
It's isolated, semiwooded,
under $40,000 so decent price.

14:58.449 --> 15:00.900
We'll just have to take a look
and see what it's like.

15:03.005 --> 15:05.939
This is it.

15:05.974 --> 15:08.286
Did they give you
the key for it?

15:08.321 --> 15:11.289
No, they didn't give me
no key.

15:11.324 --> 15:12.912
Want to walk the road?

15:12.946 --> 15:15.880
Well,
looking at something.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.848
Instead,
I cut around.

15:18.883 --> 15:20.402
Okay.

15:20.436 --> 15:21.990
We got
a couple choices here.

15:22.024 --> 15:26.132
We either go down the road
and hike 5 miles,

15:26.166 --> 15:28.651
or we cut cross country
and cut that in about half.

15:28.686 --> 15:30.688
I've got a little girl
that's getting out of school.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.448
I've got to make sure somebody
is there to catch her

15:32.483 --> 15:35.693
when she lands, so we're going
to have to take a shortcut.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.108
Yeah, I just think
it's going to be quicker.

15:37.143 --> 15:41.043
-Okay.
-It starts right back over here.

15:41.078 --> 15:44.944
Narrator:
The shortcut to the property
is 2 miles through dense forest,

15:44.978 --> 15:46.428
but the trek gives
Jason and Mary

15:46.462 --> 15:49.431
a chance to survey
the surrounding area.

15:49.465 --> 15:51.812
Jason:
Sure is thick in through here.

15:51.847 --> 15:55.092
Fresh deer trails
in through here. Some good sign.

15:55.126 --> 15:58.578
For us, hunting, gathering,
it's a lifestyle,

15:58.612 --> 16:02.651
so we're always looking for
something new to bring home.

16:02.685 --> 16:04.791
Oh, look, this comfrey
is starting to flower.

16:04.825 --> 16:06.241
Jason: Oh, cool.

16:06.275 --> 16:09.451
I'm really excited to see
that comfrey is growing.

16:09.485 --> 16:13.524
Comfrey makes a really good
external salve for bruises,

16:13.558 --> 16:17.010
and that tells me that
the soil is really rich.

16:17.045 --> 16:19.599
Are there raspberries
that I'm seeing?

16:19.633 --> 16:22.360
Yeah, there's raspberries
all over the place.

16:22.395 --> 16:26.606
Mary:
Raspberries, blackberries,
grapes, all kinds of wild food,

16:26.640 --> 16:29.609
so I'm thinking this is
going to be a great place

16:29.643 --> 16:32.129
to start growing
some fruit trees.

16:36.512 --> 16:38.756
Maybe we should have
taken the road.

16:46.350 --> 16:50.906
Narrator: CoNarrator:
In the Great Alaska Range,
the early thaw catches Morgan

16:50.940 --> 16:54.013
unprepared for the awakening
dangers of a new season.

16:56.394 --> 16:58.741
Morgan: Now that I know
there's bears out nearby,

16:58.776 --> 17:00.640
I'm looking at the yard
a little differently,

17:00.674 --> 17:02.883
thinking I probably need
to get this place cleaned up

17:02.918 --> 17:06.335
for springtime
and more bear-secure.

17:06.370 --> 17:08.613
Narrator:
The threat is heightened
at this time of year

17:08.648 --> 17:10.822
as bears emerge
from hibernation

17:10.857 --> 17:13.687
and venture out in search
of their first meal in months.

17:13.722 --> 17:18.071
I should probably get
the bells on the horses.

17:18.106 --> 17:19.590
Narrator: With the discovery
of fresh tracks

17:19.624 --> 17:21.730
just 1/2 mile
from the homestead,

17:21.764 --> 17:24.836
bear-proofing is now
an urgent priority.

17:26.183 --> 17:29.013
Right now, the bears around
here, they just don't know

17:29.048 --> 17:30.221
that we're a source of food,

17:30.256 --> 17:32.396
and we really, really want
to keep it that way,

17:32.430 --> 17:35.054
and we don't want them
to think the horses

17:35.088 --> 17:37.366
is something they can eat.

17:37.401 --> 17:39.886
The bells are really
a useful tool.

17:39.920 --> 17:44.132
They have a normal rhythm
when the horses are eating.

17:44.166 --> 17:47.031
Here, Fela.[ Bell clangs ]

17:47.066 --> 17:49.896
Oh, come here.

17:49.930 --> 17:52.243
Whoa, whoa, come here.
Stand.

17:52.278 --> 17:55.488
When you hear the bells go wild,
you know the horses are running,

17:55.522 --> 17:58.007
and something is probably wrong.

17:58.042 --> 18:01.080
But, you know, if they're
getting chased by a bear around

18:01.114 --> 18:05.774
the yard here in the middle
of the night, we'll hear it.

18:05.808 --> 18:08.846
Narrator:
A ravenous bear will eat
anything that's within reach,

18:08.880 --> 18:12.850
livestock, vegetation, or feed.

18:12.884 --> 18:14.507
The pole cache Morgan
built last year

18:14.541 --> 18:16.957
to protect his supplies
is almost full,

18:16.992 --> 18:19.719
leaving an overflow of
horse feed exposed

18:19.753 --> 18:22.101
inside a half-finished barn.

18:24.310 --> 18:27.347
Morgan:
Yeah, we don't have the siding
on it yet, so it's just plastic.

18:27.382 --> 18:29.694
I mean, a bear could walk
right in there.

18:29.729 --> 18:31.213
One thing I'd really like to do,

18:31.248 --> 18:33.008
especially in light
of these bear tracks,

18:33.042 --> 18:35.769
is get the barn sided,

18:35.804 --> 18:37.909
and now that we've got
our fuel supply in,

18:37.944 --> 18:39.497
I won't be so shy

18:39.532 --> 18:42.638
about using some up
to mill some more lumber.

18:42.673 --> 18:45.158
Narrator: With no time to lose,
Morgan sets to work

18:45.193 --> 18:47.126
prepping the logs
for the saw mill

18:47.160 --> 18:49.645
by removing the bark
and squaring them up.

18:53.925 --> 18:57.791
Morgan:
I get rid of the bark from the
outside with the smaller saw,

18:57.826 --> 19:00.587
which is a lot faster
to sharpen.

19:00.622 --> 19:04.419
I can just mill the inner wood
that's a lot cleaner

19:04.453 --> 19:07.146
with my nice milling chain
and the big saw.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.319
It burns a lot of gas,

19:08.354 --> 19:11.391
so I like it to be
as efficient as possible.

19:15.637 --> 19:21.263
What was a round log
is now a square cant.

19:21.298 --> 19:25.578
Narrator:
The Alaska mill cuts the squared
cant into 1-inch-thick boards.

19:29.375 --> 19:31.446
This whole rake here weighs
about 40 pounds,

19:31.480 --> 19:35.588
so it's definitely more work
to muscle it around.

19:39.005 --> 19:42.319
This thing is huge
and monstrous and awesome.

19:42.353 --> 19:44.804
It's great at milling lumber,

19:44.838 --> 19:47.186
and I should have
plenty of boards

19:47.220 --> 19:50.258
with what I've already
milled and these.

19:50.292 --> 19:53.122
Narrator:
The boards are fixed vertically
over a layer of plastic

19:53.157 --> 19:56.298
that helps keep moisture
out of the barn.

19:56.333 --> 19:57.920
Morgan:
I'm leaving gaps between them,

19:57.955 --> 19:59.370
and then the bark battens

19:59.405 --> 20:01.821
which are half round
and flat on one side,

20:01.855 --> 20:03.581
will cover those gaps.

20:03.616 --> 20:05.721
It makes for a pretty
durable wall.

20:05.756 --> 20:09.104
It's not something that
will break very easily.

20:09.138 --> 20:10.519
It's looking good.

20:10.554 --> 20:12.659
I'll probably keep putting
boards on and go through

20:12.694 --> 20:14.558
and start putting battens on.

20:14.592 --> 20:17.906
We've been lucky so far
keeping our supplies secure,

20:17.940 --> 20:21.496
and we're going to keep building
to hopefully keep it that way.

20:32.886 --> 20:35.441
Narrator: It's high tide
on Alaska's Glacier Bay,

20:35.475 --> 20:38.582
and nightfall isn't far behind.

20:38.616 --> 20:40.549
Brent is using the final
hours of daylight

20:40.584 --> 20:42.827
to continue hunting
for his next meal.

20:42.862 --> 20:45.554
Once I crossed back
over one point of the island,

20:45.589 --> 20:47.660
the winds were blocked.

20:47.694 --> 20:49.558
This is calmer water to fish in.

20:49.593 --> 20:51.491
Narrator: He's discovered
a patch of calm water

20:51.526 --> 20:53.286
on the opposite side of the bay,

20:53.321 --> 20:54.529
but it's impossible to know

20:54.563 --> 20:57.532
whether he'll have
better luck here.

20:57.566 --> 21:00.845
The underwater topography
is a complete unknown.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.192
Brent could be trolling
a barren shoal

21:03.227 --> 21:05.540
as easily as a school of fish.

21:05.574 --> 21:09.992
And I'm just praying that I get
the provision I need today.

21:10.027 --> 21:13.272

Brent was born in the bush,
but his skills are rusty

21:13.306 --> 21:15.998
after decades out of the wild.

21:16.033 --> 21:18.691
Unaccustomed to the challenge
of surviving alone,

21:18.725 --> 21:23.316
he's been living day to day
since returning to Alaska.

21:23.351 --> 21:27.216
Today, I got to devote
my time and energy

21:27.251 --> 21:30.427
to stocking up on food

21:30.461 --> 21:34.293
so that I can survive and have
the strength to build my cabin.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.605
Narrator: The more food he can
effectively gather,

21:36.640 --> 21:38.124

Sculpin, also known as scorpion
fish for their sharp spines,

22:11.399 --> 22:13.573

22:13.608 --> 22:16.404
