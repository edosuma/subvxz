10:07.816 --> 10:09.484
- How about a double shot,

10:09.484 --> 10:11.737
so you can have enough energy
to blow up someone else's life?

10:11.737 --> 10:14.072
- Is this about today's rehab post?

10:14.072 --> 10:17.201
Because I would never,
ever write something like that.

10:17.201 --> 10:20.829
- Right, right.
Because you have so much honor.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.333
Except when you're kissing
other people's boyfriends.

10:34.676 --> 10:38.096
- It's so annoying that my parents are
pimping out Victor to some random kid.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.765
Meanwhile, my dad treats me like

10:39.765 --> 10:41.183
I'm about to be
the next story on Dateline.

10:41.808 --> 10:42.809
[chuckles]

10:43.685 --> 10:46.480
Wow... You're even worse
at fake laughing than Victor.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.648
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

10:47.648 --> 10:49.149
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's just, you know,

10:49.149 --> 10:51.568
this whole my mom dating thing's
throwing me for a loop.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.279
- She seems like she's doing a lot better.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.823
- I know, okay?
And I wanna believe that she is,

10:56.823 --> 10:58.450
but the last guy my mom
was with was my dad,

10:58.450 --> 11:01.078
and when they split, she spiraled... hard.

11:01.787 --> 11:04.498
I just don't want some random guy
undoing all of her progress.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.125
DAWN: [gasps] Oh!
- Hi, hi, uh, you must be Felix.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.336
- Uh, yes, yes, um, uh, Pilar.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.420
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.380
- Stuart.

11:11.380 --> 11:14.132
- Thank you for meeting us here, you guys.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.676
Um, okay, I'm gonna let you guys

11:15.676 --> 11:17.010
get to know each other a little bit more,

11:17.010 --> 11:20.556
and I'm gonna go get our cakes,
and we'll get started.

11:27.646 --> 11:30.107
- So, um, how did you two meet?

11:30.107 --> 11:31.775
- I own a meditation studio,

11:31.775 --> 11:34.570
and Dawn started taking
my energy healing class.

11:34.570 --> 11:35.612
- Oh, okay.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.574
So, she must be taking
your class for mental health.

11:38.574 --> 11:40.909
I assume you guys...
talked about that, right?

11:41.618 --> 11:44.788
- We have, uh, a lot, actually,

11:44.788 --> 11:48.584
um, but who hasn't had a smidge
of depression here and there?

11:48.584 --> 11:52.129
- You know, I, I, I wouldn't,
I wouldn't call it "a smidge."

11:52.129 --> 11:55.132
You know, it almost
makes it sound... cute.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.468
- You're right. You're right.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.971
I, I guess I was just tryin'
to keep things light.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.181
- You know what?
Let me ask you something.

12:02.181 --> 12:05.309
Uh, in this class of, um, healing energy,

12:05.309 --> 12:08.478
uh, do they teach you how
to force-feed someone toast

12:08.478 --> 12:09.730
when they're unwilling to eat?

12:10.314 --> 12:13.442
Or just to get dressed?
How 'bout take a shower?

12:13.442 --> 12:16.069
- Felix, stop it.
DAWN: Okay.

12:16.862 --> 12:18.822
Who's ready to get their cake cup on?

12:19.573 --> 12:20.407
- Yeah.

12:24.536 --> 12:27.623
- You have scrolled through
"Critically Acclaimed Dark Danish Dramas"

12:27.623 --> 12:29.333
about three times now.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.292
Maybe we pick something.

12:31.126 --> 12:33.045
- Um, yeah.

12:33.045 --> 12:35.964
- See, that "yeah" sounds
like we're gonna press play,

12:35.964 --> 12:38.800
and then pause it 10 seconds later
because you wanna "talk."

12:40.010 --> 12:42.012
- It's just I thought
I would hear from Lake.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.182
I guess she's busy with Lucy.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.476
- What's goin' on with you?

12:48.352 --> 12:50.354
Are you jealous of Lucy?
- No.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.817
They've just gotten so close, so fast.

12:55.817 --> 12:59.655
I mean, when, when she was dating Felix,
she needed a girlfriend to talk about him.

12:59.655 --> 13:03.116
But... with Lucy,
her girlfriend is the girlfriend

13:03.116 --> 13:06.119
to talk to you about her girlfriend.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.622
Let's just watch a movie.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.584
[plays movie]

13:13.502 --> 13:16.505
It's just we've been
best friends since fourth grade.

13:16.505 --> 13:17.673
[pauses movie]

13:18.298 --> 13:23.595
- This is an Argentinian red
that we, actually, discovered

13:23.595 --> 13:26.557
while we were touring... the supermarket.

13:26.557 --> 13:28.016
[laughing]

13:29.101 --> 13:31.311
- Hey, uh, sorry it took me
a minute to get ready.

13:32.062 --> 13:35.065
- It's worth the wait. You clean up nice.

13:35.065 --> 13:37.693
- Thanks. I'm not, usually,
drenched in sweat

13:37.693 --> 13:39.152
when people come over for a dinner party,

13:39.152 --> 13:41.905
but it was kind of
sprung on me last minute.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.532
- Well, can I be honest?

13:43.532 --> 13:46.034
My parents dragged me
here kicking and screaming,

13:46.034 --> 13:47.619
so.
- Really?

13:47.619 --> 13:50.038
- Yeah.
- Uh, so, you didn't wanna come?

13:50.664 --> 13:54.501
- The only thing they knew about you
was that you were gay, so of course not.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.753
I was offended on principle.
- Yeah, same, same.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.840
My mom is still new to the whole
"supportive mother of a gay son" thing.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.175
- Yeah.

14:01.175 --> 14:02.384
- And, uh...

14:03.510 --> 14:06.346
also, I've kinda just recently,
um, been going through,

14:06.346 --> 14:07.514
like, a pretty bad breakup,

14:07.514 --> 14:08.932
and, um...
- Hm.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.309
- ...everyone's, like,
pressuring me to move on,

14:10.309 --> 14:11.935
but I just don't know if I'm ready to yet.

14:13.061 --> 14:16.523
- Well, I don't know.
Maybe, everyone's onto something.

14:18.817 --> 14:23.322
Um... I have an idea... Watch this.

14:23.322 --> 14:27.910
Oh, I'm, I'm such an idiot.
Mom, I, I totally forgot to bring the pie.

14:27.910 --> 14:32.122
- Oh, well, sweetie, we told
the Salazars that we would bring dessert.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.749
- I know, I know. I'm so sorry.

14:33.749 --> 14:35.626
Um, I, I can just run out
and go get another one.

14:35.626 --> 14:38.462
- It's fine.
I'm sure that I can find something.

14:38.462 --> 14:42.174
- Please, Mrs. Salazar, my parents
will never let me live this down.

14:42.174 --> 14:46.386
Um, Victor, would you wanna come with?

14:47.429 --> 14:50.015
- Uh, yeah, sure.

14:51.725 --> 14:52.935
Bye.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.401
- Is it okay if we get under the covers?

15:01.401 --> 15:05.322
Um... I'm a little self-conscious
about my thighs.

15:05.322 --> 15:08.325
- Your thighs? I love your thighs.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.702
Yeah, for me, it's my arms.

15:10.702 --> 15:13.830

But I did back-trace the username
of the person who did post about you,

16:25.068 --> 16:26.612
and it's that senior kid, Jonah.

16:27.779 --> 16:32.409

with you... so he's the asshole.

18:06.712 --> 18:10.174
- Well, I thought, maybe,
that I could fill in for Lake.

18:10.174 --> 18:11.592
Be your girlfriend for tonight.

18:12.801 --> 18:17.973
- Aww. Well, that's the sweetest thing
any girlfriend has ever done for me.

18:17.973 --> 18:20.309
- Hm.
[phone ringing]

18:21.310 --> 18:24.938
- It's Lake. Uh, I could ignore it.

18:25.397 --> 18:28.400
- No, take it.
I'm gonna focus on my shrinking pores.

18:29.568 --> 18:31.278
- Hey, uh, what's up?

18:31.278 --> 18:33.280
- It was totally on, and I blew it.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.740
MIA [on phone]:
Wh-- Okay, okay. Slow down.

18:34.740 --> 18:36.408
What happened? Is, is she still there?

18:36.408 --> 18:38.744
- Yes, she's waiting for me in bed.

18:38.744 --> 18:42.831
Everything was fine, and then the clothes
started coming off and I panicked.

18:43.582 --> 18:45.167
Mia, I don't know what I'm doing.

18:45.167 --> 18:50.088
What if I'm... terrible at sex with her
and screw everything up?

18:50.088 --> 18:52.132
- Okay, all right. Breathe.

18:52.132 --> 18:55.093
I'm no expert on queer sex,

18:55.093 --> 18:58.013
but can I at least remind you
of a piece of information

18:58.013 --> 18:59.306
that you may have forgotten?

18:59.306 --> 19:00.307
- Okay.

19:00.307 --> 19:04.102
- You're a woman,
and you know what you like. True?

19:05.229 --> 19:07.564
- True.
- Just start with that

19:07.564 --> 19:08.899
and check in with her.

19:08.899 --> 19:11.193
And if all else fails,
you can do what I do with Andrew,

19:11.193 --> 19:12.361
and kiss her on the cheek

19:12.361 --> 19:14.530
and say, "Now you do
whatever you want to me."

19:14.530 --> 19:16.740
- That all makes perfect sense.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.284
Thank god for you.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.578
- Call me later and tell me
how it goes, okay?

19:22.329 --> 19:24.706
- Duh, bitch. I love you.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.124
- Love you.

19:28.252 --> 19:30.087
- It's not fair to your mom, Felix.

19:31.171 --> 19:34.591
For... you trying to scare
him away like that.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.427
I know you're coming from a good place,

19:38.178 --> 19:41.014
but... you're acting like my dad.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.475
He's so overprotective,

19:43.475 --> 19:46.395
and scared of anyone
ever trying to hurt me

19:46.395 --> 19:48.564
that he doesn't let me live my life.

19:48.564 --> 19:51.400
And now, I'm forced to hide
the best thing that's happened to me

19:51.400 --> 19:54.778
in, probably, forever from him
and it... it feels terrible.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.905
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.242
I'm the best thing that's
ever happened to you?

20:00.242 --> 20:01.076
Little ol' me?

20:01.577 --> 20:05.330
- Mmm, second best.
That cake in a cup was really good.

20:07.541 --> 20:10.961
But, you have to let
your mom live, Felix.

20:11.670 --> 20:14.006
Even if you're scared of her getting hurt.

20:15.757 --> 20:19.052
And guess what? Things could work out.

20:21.513 --> 20:22.723
- That was insane.

20:22.723 --> 20:25.142
I've never done anything like that before.

20:25.851 --> 20:26.852
Do I look okay?

20:27.394 --> 20:29.938
- Yeah, um, better than this pie.

20:29.938 --> 20:32.858
I think it got crushed in the backseat.
- Great. Okay.

20:32.858 --> 20:34.067
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:35.194 --> 20:39.198
Your buttons are all screwed.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.918
We have to go.
- Yeah, yeah, let's go inside.

20:51.543 --> 20:52.961
Take that. [clears throat]
All right.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.548
Hey.
- Finally.

20:57.132 --> 20:58.759
DOUG: Everything go all right
at the grocery store?

20:58.759 --> 20:59.593
- Oh yeah.

20:59.593 --> 21:03.430
- Uh, yeah, just took us
a little while to find a pie.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.769
- So, he's really cute
and he's really nice,

21:08.769 --> 21:10.604
and you can't be mad at me, right?

21:11.146 --> 21:11.980
- We'll talk later.

21:11.980 --> 21:14.274
- [sing-songy]
You like him. You really like him.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.484
- Just gimme some rice, please.

21:17.486 --> 21:19.738
- Okay.

21:19.738 --> 21:21.949
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

21:26.453 --> 21:30.290
Okay, I'm... dying to know.
What did you think of him?

21:33.335 --> 21:38.757
- I thought he was great.
Yeah, no, I really, really liked him.

21:38.757 --> 21:39.800
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.802
- Oh, good.

21:41.802 --> 21:45.138
Because you have no idea how
rare it is to find a guy like this.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.974
Oh my gosh. He's, like--

21:46.974 --> 21:49.142
He's funny,
but he doesn't know he's funny.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.353
He's talkative,
but he's also a good listener.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.772
And he's smart. He's so, so, so,
so, so smart, and he's kind.

21:53.772 --> 21:55.190
He reminds me of you.

21:56.191 --> 21:57.734
- You are just wonderful.

21:57.734 --> 22:00.362
Good night, you guys. See you at church!
- Have a great night.

22:00.362 --> 22:02.239
- Ciao. [chuckles]

22:02.239 --> 22:05.450
So... are you gonna see him again?

22:07.244 --> 22:09.621
- Probably, yeah.

22:09.621 --> 22:12.249
You got lucky, okay? I, I like him.

22:13.250 --> 22:16.920
But really, Ma, y--
you need to chill out.

22:16.920 --> 22:21.800
