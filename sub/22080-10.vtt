WEBVTT

00:07.215 --> 00:09.175
[Nick] All right, let's see.
How does this thing work?

00:09.259 --> 00:11.302
Let me just get... [grunts]

00:11.386 --> 00:12.595
Yeah, got it.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.640
Finally. Now we can watch our first porn.

00:15.724 --> 00:18.018
[sobbing] Missy!

00:18.101 --> 00:21.521
I'll never love anyone again,
and no one will ever love me.

00:21.604 --> 00:25.275
Ohh, Andrew, you know
I really don't like seeing weakness.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.193
- [sobs] I'm not crying.
- Uh-huh.

00:27.277 --> 00:30.655
Maybe if I die, she'll feel bad
and take me back.

00:30.739 --> 00:34.743
Good idea. Or we could watch
the Sylvester Stallone porn.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.202
"The Italian Stallion,

00:36.286 --> 00:39.164
the story of two young lovers
beefing in a gross motel."

00:39.247 --> 00:43.376
Two young lovers?
Oh, Missy, why did you break up with us?

00:43.460 --> 00:44.753
Goddamn it.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.504
Well, well, well, a hole.

00:46.588 --> 00:50.175
[gasps] Ooh! And crotch level, no less.
Mmm, yes, please.

00:50.759 --> 00:54.179
All right, once I press play,
our lives will be changed forever.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.765
I literally do not care about anything.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.934
Hey, before we start, I want you boys
to meet my fiancÃ©e, Candice.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.603
She's absolutely perfect.

01:01.686 --> 01:04.647
I mean, the only downside
is the dick splinters.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.108
[music playing]

01:07.192 --> 01:09.819
Hey, Kitty, you wanna hop
on this stallion or what?

01:09.903 --> 01:13.656
- Sure, but I only ride bareback.
- Oh, yeah, great.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.283
- Hoo hoo!
- Whoa...

01:15.366 --> 01:18.328
Oh, yes. Oh, this is great.
You're great.

01:18.411 --> 01:19.871
- [Kitty] Is it great?
- [Stallone] Oh, that's great.

01:19.954 --> 01:21.915
Hey, Kitty, you gotta do one thing for me.

01:21.998 --> 01:24.209
- [Kitty] What?
- Stroke the shaft, cup the balls.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.960
- Whoa...
- [grunting and moaning]

01:27.212 --> 01:29.422
Adrian!

02:02.705 --> 02:07.335
All right. Wrestling is apparently
not what we're doing here today.

02:07.418 --> 02:09.921
It's a field trip
to the police department.

02:10.004 --> 02:12.132
Matthew, you clearly lied to me.

02:12.215 --> 02:15.844
The man rode on a bus for 20 minutes
in a wrestling singlet

02:15.927 --> 02:17.345
and didn't ask a single question.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.806
I don't think I can keep my balls
to one side.

02:19.889 --> 02:21.599
I really think I'm gonna have
to spread 'em.

02:21.683 --> 02:24.269
All right, kids. Welcome
to the Bridgeton Police Department.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.687
Yes, son. Do you have a question?

02:25.770 --> 02:28.481
Oh. Nah. I just keep my hands up
in a police station.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.025
- You know, 'cause, uh, duh.
- That's a good call.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.778
Hey, guys. Check it out, my first zit.

02:33.862 --> 02:36.739
I guess watching The Italian Stallion
knocked something loose...

02:36.823 --> 02:38.074
[chuckles] you know, manhood-wise.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.868
Oh, please. You call that a zit?

02:39.951 --> 02:42.954
My crackne's so bad
I take Ortho Tri-Cyclen,

02:43.037 --> 02:45.665
which is basically birth control.
Ha ha!

02:45.748 --> 02:47.834
Up top. No? Fuck you, guys.

02:47.917 --> 02:51.588
All right, everyone, file in.
This is our line up room.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.464
That's one of those
two-way mirrors, right?

02:53.548 --> 02:56.009
So I can see them and they can see me?

02:56.092 --> 02:58.553
You are thinking of a window,
you orangutan.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.221
Matthew, cutting deep.

03:01.389 --> 03:04.142
- Oh, hi-- hi, Andrew.
- Oh. Hi, Missy.

03:04.225 --> 03:06.519
Okay, kids, let's see those profiles.

03:06.603 --> 03:10.148
I was, um, just hoping that, um,
maybe we could be friends?

03:10.231 --> 03:15.361
Oh, Missy, I can't be your friend
and just pretend I don't love you.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.698
And then what? Someday I get
an invitation to your wedding,

03:18.781 --> 03:21.409
and I watch you marry a guy named Joel.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.161
What do you see in Joel?

03:23.244 --> 03:25.413
I guess he's an architect.
He's a good man.

03:25.496 --> 03:27.540
Missy, I'm happy for you.

03:28.124 --> 03:31.294
Sarge, we just found another dead body
with their ponytail cut off.

03:31.377 --> 03:33.588
- The Ponytail Killer strikes again.
- Damn it!

03:33.671 --> 03:35.381
Hold on. Is that what we're calling him?

03:35.465 --> 03:38.259
'Cause I thought we were going
with the Ponytail Prowler?

03:38.343 --> 03:41.387
- Why prowler? He's not a cat burglar.
- I like alliteration.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.140
How about Ponytail, uh... Person?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.100
That's nothing. That's a nothing nickname.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.144
Enough! Women are dying!

03:48.228 --> 03:51.105
Now I want a catchy nickname on my desk
by the end of the day.

03:51.189 --> 03:55.193
So this is our crime lab.
It's where we analyze genetic evidence.

03:55.276 --> 03:56.527
Can I have a volunteer?

03:56.611 --> 03:59.447
How about you,
the child with the puffy lifeless eyes.

03:59.530 --> 04:02.367
Your results might be tainted
because I'm empty inside.

04:02.450 --> 04:05.578
You guys realize DNA is a hoax
created by gay scientists, right?

04:05.662 --> 04:07.664
[groans] Stop quoting
your dad's law commercials.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.541
- Oh, yeah? Maybe I will stop.
- Don't you dare.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.466
- Oh, yeah, my mouth is sopping wet.
- No, no, don't talk, don't talk.

04:20.843 --> 04:24.180
Hey, that's the old pet cemetery
where my dad is buried.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.265
Whoa!

04:25.348 --> 04:29.269
That's Carole from my Curves gym
who yells at me for not being female.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.772
And that's the bus driver
with the pretty, pretty ponytail.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.440
What a coinkydink.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.485
Sir, if you don't mind,
we'd like to ask you a few questions.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.696
Me? A legit hang sesh?

04:39.779 --> 04:42.240
Spoiler alert, I'm your guy.

04:42.323 --> 04:44.575
Yeah, you just might be.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.036
- Wait, wait.
- What?

04:47.120 --> 04:50.581
Hey, I'm not complaining or anything,
but why do you keep kissing me?

04:50.665 --> 04:53.251
I'm just acting out because my parents
are getting divorced. Don't stop.

04:53.334 --> 04:57.672
- Got it. But I crave emotional intimacy.
- Oh, boy.

04:57.755 --> 05:00.425
Because my parents
have a no-touch policy with me.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.969
So I don't really feel
human contact at all.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.013
- Oh, God.
- Unless I trick people into touching me,

05:05.096 --> 05:07.432
like, by pretending
to be falling down or something.

05:07.515 --> 05:10.476
- What?
- I think I want more of a relationship.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.186
- Does that sound gay?
- Um...

05:12.270 --> 05:14.397
Baby, you gotta throw this boy a bone.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.859
Anything to make him start
frenching you again.

05:17.942 --> 05:21.529
- [groans] Fine. One date.
- Yes! Fuck yeah!

05:21.612 --> 05:23.698
Now smooch up on him.

05:25.867 --> 05:30.455
Oh, look at those adorable little fingers.
I can't stand being so close to her.

05:30.538 --> 05:32.373
You know what might make you feel better?

05:32.457 --> 05:34.876
Going home and watching porn again?

05:34.959 --> 05:37.795
Ah, yes.
The student has become the master.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.422
Oh, that would make a pretty good porn.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.841
Hey, Andrew, who's that, like, creature
you're friends with?

05:41.924 --> 05:43.134
The-- the puberty guy?

05:43.217 --> 05:44.886
- The hormone monster?
- Yeah.

05:44.969 --> 05:47.638
Now that I have this zit,
I feel like we should have a chat.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.724
- He wants to talk to you.
- [groans]

05:49.807 --> 05:52.852
So, what makes you think
you'd be a good candidate for puberty?

05:52.935 --> 05:55.605
Well, I'm almost 13,
I have kissed two girls,

05:55.688 --> 05:58.941
and, of course... [chuckles]
the old Yellowstone Caldera here.

05:59.025 --> 05:59.901
Nice callback.

05:59.984 --> 06:03.362
So I know you, uh, recently watched
The Italian Stallion.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.614
Did you cum?

06:04.697 --> 06:06.282
Oh, yeah. Big time.

06:06.365 --> 06:07.825
Oh, yeah? And what did that feel like?

06:07.909 --> 06:10.828
Like puncturing a Capri Sun
on the first try?

06:10.912 --> 06:13.289
[chuckles] Okay. I think we're done here.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.458
Give me a call in, like,
I don't know, two years.

06:15.541 --> 06:19.295
- Oh, come on, please. What about the zit?
- Oh, right. Yeah, let me see that.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.422
- Ow!
- Look, your zit just came

06:21.506 --> 06:23.966
- more than you ever have. [laughs]
- [groans]

06:24.050 --> 06:25.718
He was totally unreasonable

06:25.802 --> 06:29.013
and he was, like, eating pistachios
the whole time, which felt rude.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.599
Yeah, he loves pistachios.
I mean, he's a weird guy.

06:31.682 --> 06:32.642
So I gotta go.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.268
Hold on. Aren't you coming over?

06:34.352 --> 06:39.315
No, I have plans. I'm-- I'm going
to my, um, aunt's wedding.

06:39.398 --> 06:40.775
Your aunt's getting married on a Thursday?

06:40.858 --> 06:42.527
Yeah, she's cheap. Cheap lady.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.695
- Okay, let's hang out tomorrow.
- Okay.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.447
Nice lie, baby.

06:46.531 --> 06:49.867
I mean, the kid had no idea
that your aunt died years ago

06:49.951 --> 06:54.205
after a slow miserable battle
with cancer. Ha ha! Idiot.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.209
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?

06:58.292 --> 07:01.629
What? We're gonna watch the porn,
so I can forget about Missy.

07:01.712 --> 07:02.797
The same one?

07:02.880 --> 07:04.549
Oh, my little sweet potato,

07:04.632 --> 07:07.135
there's a whole world of pornography
out there.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.011
In fact, you can trace erotica

07:09.095 --> 07:12.014
all the way back
to the early Paleolithic cave drawings.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.058
- Whoa.
- What's your safe word again?

07:14.142 --> 07:16.853
Honestly, I'm embarrassed,
but it's "ooga-booga."

07:16.936 --> 07:21.023
In the third century, the Kama Sutra
became the standard go-to jerk work.

07:21.107 --> 07:21.941
[Andrew] Wow.

07:22.024 --> 07:24.819
Sorry, can you just shift a little bit?
My leg is cramping.

07:24.902 --> 07:27.780
You're cramping? I'm upside fucking down.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.198
Very well-researched.

07:29.282 --> 07:33.244
Video changed the game,
and for a while flicks helped us fap.

07:33.327 --> 07:36.289
Did someone order a pizza?
'Cause I already ate it.

07:36.372 --> 07:39.208
Jesus, Ron, are you gonna
burp into my pussy again?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.836
Why would that guy be in a...
Oh, it's quite big.

07:41.919 --> 07:45.006
And, finally, the mother
of all pornovations...

07:45.089 --> 07:46.466
the internet.

07:46.549 --> 07:49.969
Everything you could ever want,
whenever you want it.

07:51.721 --> 07:55.391
Amazing. Oh, but this site says
I need to be 18.

07:55.475 --> 07:59.729
I think we're gonna be okay, Andrew.
I'm 75 million years old.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.606
- [moaning]
- Whoa.

08:02.523 --> 08:03.816
[moaning]

08:03.900 --> 08:06.319
- Hi, Andrew. I like your fedora.
- Missy.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.403
Hi, hi.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.989
It's really nice being alone with you.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.908
Andrew, we need to break up.

08:11.991 --> 08:12.992
[grunts]

08:13.075 --> 08:15.620
I want you, Andrew.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.705
- Welcome to jazz club.
- [woman] Oh, yeah.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.373
See you at school tomorrow.

08:19.874 --> 08:20.875
Seven minutes of--

08:20.958 --> 08:23.127
[moaning and panting]

08:23.211 --> 08:24.712
[alarm clock buzzing]

08:24.795 --> 08:29.300
- [man] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- [woman moaning]

08:29.383 --> 08:30.468
[sighs]

08:30.551 --> 08:32.720
- Oh, boy, what a night.
- [alarm stops]

08:32.803 --> 08:34.847
- When did you finally go to sleep?
- I didn't.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.975
Oh. Mature group pissing?

08:38.059 --> 08:41.270
I guess I just got a little bored
of the solo pissing stuff.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.689
- Uh-huh. Sure, okay.
- All right.

08:43.773 --> 08:47.443
I guess I should go to school,
even though there's no porn there.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.736
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:48.819 --> 08:52.365
You can't leave your room like this.
Your mom will mature piss herself.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.158
Oh, yeah, yeah. Good call.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.910
I'm gonna toss all these
in the kitchen garbage.

08:55.993 --> 08:59.080
Are you crazy?
You gotta go offsite with this biohazard.

08:59.163 --> 09:00.665
- [shattering]
- Oh, boy.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.833
The synagogue, huh?

09:02.917 --> 09:06.379
I guess the smell of pickled herring
will hide the scent of your seed.

09:06.462 --> 09:09.465
- That's exactly what I was thinking.
- You're very smart.

09:09.549 --> 09:13.511
And chemical bonds that exist
between two atoms that share electrons

09:13.594 --> 09:17.515
- are called covalent bonds.
- [tapping on chalkboard]

09:17.598 --> 09:18.933
- Andrew.
- Huh? What?

09:19.016 --> 09:22.270
Can you give us an example of a molecule
with a covalent bond?

09:22.353 --> 09:24.605
Um... a big molecule?

09:24.689 --> 09:26.399
You haven't been listening at all,
have you?

09:26.482 --> 09:29.527
You're being very, very bad.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.407
Do you need to be punished, Andrew?

09:34.490 --> 09:38.536
Oh, I need to be punished
'cause I'm a bad little baby.

09:38.619 --> 09:41.789
Why don't you bend me over that desk
and spank me on the ass?

09:41.872 --> 09:43.124
Excuse me, Mr. Glouberman?

09:43.207 --> 09:44.166
Oh, hi.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.003
He wants you to spank him on his ass
as if he were a baby,

09:47.086 --> 09:49.255
even though he's not actually a baby.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.382
But he wants it over the desk
because he's a bad little bitch.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.219
All right, so where were you
on the night of August 21?

09:55.303 --> 09:58.055
Let's see. I was home by myself.

09:58.639 --> 10:02.268
- What about September 11th?
- Oh, my birthday. I was home alone.

10:02.351 --> 10:03.436
September 28th?

10:03.519 --> 10:05.938
I was watching Home Alone
at home, alone.

10:06.022 --> 10:09.400
Sir, I gotta tell you,
based on your lack of alibi

10:09.483 --> 10:11.902
and your various connections
to the victims,

10:11.986 --> 10:14.363
you are currently a person of interest.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.865
So let me get this straight:

10:15.948 --> 10:19.285
you think that I am interesting
and also a person?

10:19.368 --> 10:24.957
You're the person, Steve.
You have the right to remain awesome.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.294
- Hey, Andrew.
- What, Missy?

10:28.377 --> 10:31.631
Oh, well, I just saw what happened
in Science class.

10:31.714 --> 10:32.965
Is-- is everything okay, Andrew?

10:33.049 --> 10:35.259
Yep. Hunky-dory. Okay, bye.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.469
We're going to my house, right?

10:36.552 --> 10:39.180
No, I gotta go home to the baseball game.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.598
- What?
- With my aunt.

10:40.681 --> 10:43.267
Why is your aunt going to a baseball game
the day after her wedding?

10:43.351 --> 10:45.728
I don't know, Nick.
Why would you suck on a strap-on?

10:45.811 --> 10:49.023
The thing's made of plastic.
Who benefits from that? I have to go.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.399
What's going on with Andrew?

10:50.483 --> 10:53.527
I don't know, Missy,
but I'm pretty sure it's your fault.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.613
Oh, no. I don't doubt it.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.365
[panting]

10:57.448 --> 10:58.532
All right.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.494
No. What the hell? The Wi-Fi is out.

11:01.577 --> 11:05.289
No big deal. We don't need porn.
Let's just use our imaginations.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.166
You remember what tits look like, right?

11:07.249 --> 11:10.544
They're like... like, like round boxes.

11:11.712 --> 11:15.091
- Why doesn't anything in this house work?
- Yeah. Why doesn't anything work?

11:15.174 --> 11:17.676
- What are you talking about?
- This house sucks.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.221
- Yeah, it does suck.
- Why is it my fault?

11:20.304 --> 11:21.931
[yells]

11:22.014 --> 11:24.475
You know who's funny? The Big Bang Theory.

11:25.142 --> 11:28.479
May I offer you a beverage? Ta-da!

11:28.562 --> 11:31.148
Why isn't your magic
as annoying as it used to be?

11:31.232 --> 11:34.360
'Cause he looks like a sexy porcupine.

11:34.443 --> 11:37.071
You know, my dad called your dad
about being his divorce lawyer.

11:37.154 --> 11:40.741
Oh, boy. Guy Bilzerian
is gonna destroy your mom.

11:40.825 --> 11:41.867
She deserves it.

11:41.951 --> 11:45.079
My dad's living in the basement.
There's no bathroom down there.

11:45.162 --> 11:47.581
He has to shower in the backyard.
It's so sad.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.084
My dad has a shower in his office.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.670
He and his receptionist
both have robes there.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.672
Your dad is screwing his receptionist?

11:54.755 --> 11:56.507
Oh, I never thought of it like that.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.050
- Oh, my God.
- Fuck.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.260
Both our houses suck.

11:59.343 --> 12:01.971
Yeah. But spending time with you
doesn't suck.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.180
Aww.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.390
[man] Oh, no.

12:04.473 --> 12:06.642
[heavy breathing]

12:08.394 --> 12:10.396
Ponytail.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.318
[doorbell ringing]

12:16.402 --> 12:19.822
Oh, Andrew. Are you sick?
Have you lost a lot of fluids?

12:19.905 --> 12:21.157
No, Mrs. Birch. I'm fine.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.160
He's not fine.
A cardiologist knows a broken heart.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.288
- Aww, you poor baby.
- And there's only one cure.

12:27.371 --> 12:30.541
A hug from your friend's father
while he holds a magazine.

12:30.624 --> 12:32.835
I thought you were going
to a baseball game with your aunt?

12:32.918 --> 12:35.171
Oh. Um, a foul ball hit her in the face,

12:35.254 --> 12:36.964
- so she died in 2011.
- What?

12:37.047 --> 12:39.175
Can I use your bathroom?
Does your bathroom have a lock?

12:39.258 --> 12:41.594
- You wanna use it right now?
- Oh, and what's your Wi-Fi password?

12:41.677 --> 12:43.929
Oh, that's "WE LOVE OUR CHILDREN,"
all caps.

12:44.013 --> 12:47.433
- I gotta go.
- Have fun surfing the web. [chuckles]

12:47.516 --> 12:51.729
Oh, Andrew, you make me feel so good.

12:51.812 --> 12:53.647
So can you take your clothes off?

12:53.731 --> 12:56.358
But you must go
to my Amazon wish list first

12:56.442 --> 12:58.861
and buy me mini fridge.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.530
You'll take off your clothes
if I buy you a mini fridge?

13:01.614 --> 13:05.910
[Svetlana] Yes. I'm so hot,
but I must be made cold.

13:05.993 --> 13:06.994
- [knock on door]
- [muffled gasp]

13:07.077 --> 13:09.747
Andrew, you okay? Who are you talking to?

13:09.830 --> 13:11.081
[Andrew] Occupied.

13:11.665 --> 13:14.043
Hey, sweetheart,
you need to take a break from pornography.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.837
What? Are you kidding?
I thought you were a hormone monster.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.923
Hey, you know I'm all about
jacking that stack,

13:19.006 --> 13:22.384
living that horndog life, whoop-whoop!
But this is pure compulsion.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.095
You've taken something beautiful
and made it ugly.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.972
Well, then get lost, Maury.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.307
Wow, that's cold.

13:28.390 --> 13:29.850
[sighs] Goodbye, kiddo.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.435
Whoop-whoop.

13:31.519 --> 13:32.937
And then, after all those lies,

13:33.020 --> 13:35.397
he comes over and locks himself
in the bathroom.

13:35.481 --> 13:39.485
- It doesn't make any sense.
- It's as clear as day. He's doing smack.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.278
I don't know.
That doesn't sound like Andrew.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.031
My friend Booger Wheeler
got left by a lady.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.325
Sent him straight to the needle.
[chortles]

13:46.408 --> 13:50.454
âª And he died with his eyes open wide âª

13:50.538 --> 13:52.373
So, what are you saying? It's hopeless?

13:52.456 --> 13:54.792
No. Go save your friend.

13:54.875 --> 13:58.170
Kick down the door, grab his drugs
and bring him up here.

13:58.254 --> 14:02.800
âª And don't forget to bring a spoon âª

14:03.884 --> 14:06.887
- [man] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- [moaning and panting]

14:07.805 --> 14:09.640
Oh, Andrew. Hey, great.

14:09.723 --> 14:10.599
Whoa, what the--?

14:10.683 --> 14:13.102
- Why don't you come in here, join us?
- Me?

14:13.185 --> 14:15.396
Yeah, you. Could it be? Don't know.

14:15.479 --> 14:18.482
Adrian, you stole a cookie
from the cookie jar.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.609
- Uh, I'm Andrew.
- Yeah, this is Cookie.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.610
My name's Kitty.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.738
Hey, and I'm great. Come on in, buddy.
Yeah, through the screen.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.157
- What? Come in?
- That's it. Closer.

14:27.241 --> 14:30.202
Okay, I don't know why I trust you,
but I-- whoa!

14:31.912 --> 14:34.832
Andrew, open up. Put down the needle.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.250
[grunting]

14:36.333 --> 14:37.877
- Andrew?
- He's gone.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.880
- Did he OD on heroin?
- Heroin? No.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.590
He's addicted to pornography.

14:42.673 --> 14:47.094
Nick, Andrew has been sucked
into the PornScape.

14:47.678 --> 14:48.512
The what?

14:48.596 --> 14:53.017
An alternate dimension
where pornography comes to life.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.518
PornScape.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.854
- [man] Oh, yeah.
- [Nick] Oh, God.

14:56.937 --> 14:57.938
- Oh, yeah.
- Andrew!

14:58.022 --> 15:00.232
If we don't get him out
of the PornScape soon,

15:00.316 --> 15:04.111
he'll never be able to connect to anyone
on an emotional or sexual level.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.654
- Take my hand, Ned.
- It's Nick.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.072
Yeah, that's what I said.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.450
- Just squeeze a little bit. No.
- Okay. I'm a little...

15:09.533 --> 15:11.994
Sorry, can you just shift a little?
My leg is cramping.

15:12.077 --> 15:16.332
Oh, you're cramping?
I'm upside fucking down.

15:16.999 --> 15:20.127
Ugh! The synagogue
where Cantor Dina works.

15:20.210 --> 15:22.004
I just wanna, like, do something to it.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.839
Let's throw a brick through a window.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.008
Um, of the synagogue?
That's a little hate crimey, Jay.

15:26.091 --> 15:31.639
What if we let it be known
that Cantor Dina, as a snack,

15:31.722 --> 15:32.932
eats little pieces of shit?

15:33.015 --> 15:34.767
Why is that your go-to thing?

15:34.850 --> 15:36.101
- [thump]
- What's that?

15:36.185 --> 15:38.312
- [meowing]
- Aww.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.689
What's wrong, buddy? What's in there?

15:41.565 --> 15:43.317
[screaming]

15:43.400 --> 15:45.319
- [Jay] Holy shit!
- [Jessi] Oh, my God! There's a dead body!

15:45.402 --> 15:47.821
- Will you be my girlfriend?
- What? This is not the time!

15:47.905 --> 15:49.531
- Then when is?
- Not now!

15:49.615 --> 15:52.284
- I'm in love with you, Jessi!
- [screaming]

15:54.078 --> 15:57.247
- Whoa. The Italian Stallion?
- Hey, great.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.375
We're looking for Andrew.
Have you seen him?

15:59.458 --> 16:01.919
Pear-shaped, glasses,
smells like cold pasta.

16:02.002 --> 16:04.922
Oh, yeah. I thought his name was Adrian.

16:05.005 --> 16:07.758
He's the king.
'Cause, you know, he's a good king.

16:08.342 --> 16:12.012
- Yeah, well, we need to talk to him.
- Oh, you don't talk, though, you listen.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.098
You know, in here,
we're all his children, right?

16:14.181 --> 16:16.100
- I mean, the guy is a sex god.
- [Nick] Huh.

16:16.183 --> 16:18.852
- Do you know how to find him?
- Yeah, he's up the River Dicks.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.063
I'll take you there,
and this hairy guy too.

16:21.146 --> 16:24.692
Get over here. Give me a kiss.
Get the fuck outta here. Let's go.

16:27.444 --> 16:29.321
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!
- [moans]

16:30.531 --> 16:31.615
What is this place?

16:31.699 --> 16:33.784
What you're seeing
is Andrew's search history.

16:33.867 --> 16:36.203
Everything he watched, you know,
come to life.

16:36.870 --> 16:40.040
Hey, great.
It's Mickey, Paulie, and all the gals.

16:40.624 --> 16:41.458
This is my fault.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.169
I never should've forced Andrew
to watch The Italian Stallion.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.630
Uh... maybe I had something to do with it,

16:46.714 --> 16:48.590
you know, ravaging him
with puberty and all.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.093
Speaking of, when are you
gonna ravage me with puberty?

16:51.176 --> 16:53.512
Oh, this again. You're just not ready.

16:53.595 --> 16:56.598
Then why did you bring me along
to this porn world?

16:56.682 --> 16:58.267
It's called the PornScape.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.352
It's a cool name. Please use it.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.396
I brought you to the PornScape

17:02.479 --> 17:04.732
because Andrew listens to you.
He respects you.

17:04.815 --> 17:07.151
Hey, no offense, but we're here.

17:10.654 --> 17:12.990
- But where's Andrew?
- Adrian? Hey, king's in there.

17:13.073 --> 17:13.949
[hormone monster] Whoa.

17:14.033 --> 17:18.078
It's the heart from the science museum
where I skullfucked Garrison Keillor.

17:18.162 --> 17:21.081
Andrew and Missy almost kissed there,
but that's not relevant.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.249
All you need to know

17:22.332 --> 17:24.793
is that I put my penis
in Garrison Keillor's skull.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.214
- [muffled shout]
- Aah!

17:29.298 --> 17:31.508
- Sorry. You can't go in there.
- [Andrew] Ah-pah-pah!

17:31.592 --> 17:33.343
Bring them to me.

17:38.098 --> 17:40.893
- Oh, Andrew. Jesus Christ.
- [bleating]

17:40.976 --> 17:43.854
- Whoa, great jack shack, man.
- What's that shirt?

17:44.521 --> 17:45.689
My porn shirt?

17:45.773 --> 17:49.610
It's from my Dracula costume
from two years ago. Halloween.

17:49.693 --> 17:52.654
- What brings you travelers here?
- Uh-huh. We're here to save you.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.323
I choose not to be saved.

17:54.406 --> 17:58.243
Yes, he wants to stay
and buy me mini dishwasher.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.371
Small, but can fit big plates.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.165
You know, you haven't taken
anything off yet.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.875
Andrew, this isn't who you are.

18:04.958 --> 18:07.419
You're not a sex freak.
You're a sweet guy.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.755
You don't like all of this.
You like Missy.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.673
- [groans]
- [rumbling]

18:13.092 --> 18:16.637
No. It hurts too much out there.
Nobody can hurt me in here.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.721
But this isn't real.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.390
- It is to me, Nick. It is--
- [smacking]

18:20.474 --> 18:22.810
Will you stop spanking him
for five seconds while I'm talking?

18:22.893 --> 18:23.727
Uh, sorry, boss.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.813
Okay, fine. Let's do this.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.481
If you won't leave, I won't either.

18:27.564 --> 18:30.275
I'll throw away my life
and be a part of your crazy porn world.

18:30.359 --> 18:34.196
Scape. It's a PornScape.
Why is this so hard for you?

18:34.279 --> 18:36.907
Whatever. PornScape. Sign me up.

18:36.990 --> 18:40.160
I'll jack off that guy
and rim job that girl,

18:40.244 --> 18:41.745
and eat everyone's ass out.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.997
- That's what a rim job is, Nick.
- Exactly.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.958
The rim of his anus.
It couldn't be more clear.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.501
You see what I'm dealing with here,
Andrew?

18:47.584 --> 18:49.086
Oh, fine. Who cares?

18:49.169 --> 18:51.004
Come and get me, you freaks.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.340
Yeah. Okay.

18:53.423 --> 18:54.925
[shudders] Uh-oh.

18:55.008 --> 18:57.928
Uh, Andrew, we need to get this kid
outta here, like, right now.

18:58.011 --> 19:01.557
He's gonna get molested
and I don't mean fun babysitter molested.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.809
- Andrew?
- [Svetlana] I want you.

19:03.892 --> 19:04.726
No!

19:04.810 --> 19:08.355
Hey, leave him alone.
He's not ready for any of this.

19:08.438 --> 19:10.941
Maurice, let's get out of here.

19:11.024 --> 19:12.651
- [panting]
- Oh, shit.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.571
These horny fucks are so fast.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.531
[bleating]

19:18.699 --> 19:21.660
[panting] Oh, I'm out of shape.
I gotta smoke less.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.708
Hey, you ain't leaving with our king.
I mean, the king's great.

19:27.791 --> 19:31.044
Boys, take the boat and go on without me.
I'll hold off the Stallion.

19:31.128 --> 19:34.965
- But, Maury, we can't leave you.
- Go, boys. Go, now!

19:35.048 --> 19:37.301
Let's see what you got, you juiced pig.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.138
Hey, this isn't great.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.766
[moaning and grunting]

19:44.850 --> 19:47.227
Cowabunga!

19:49.021 --> 19:50.397
This is great!

19:50.480 --> 19:52.065
[monster groaning]

19:52.149 --> 19:53.901
Oh. I feel bad for him.

19:53.984 --> 19:59.156
No. He's told me many times
this is exactly how he wanted to go.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.284
- Andrew, wait!
- Missy?

20:02.367 --> 20:04.661
- What are you doing here?
- I-- I came to find you.

20:04.745 --> 20:07.080
- Guys, we gotta get out of here.
- We can be happy here.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.333
- I wanna get back together with you.
- Really?

20:09.416 --> 20:11.418
Andrew, you can't stay here with Missy.

20:12.920 --> 20:13.962
Oh.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.381
- That's not really Missy.
- How do you know?

20:16.465 --> 20:20.385
[sighs] Because the real Missy
doesn't want to be with me.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.471
Also, look at her feet.
She got those dildo feet.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.473
- Okay, let's go.
- Well, you know what, Andrew?

20:24.556 --> 20:27.309
[voice distorts]
You aren't going anywhere.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.852
[roaring]

20:32.564 --> 20:34.024
[screaming]

20:36.944 --> 20:37.819
[groans]

20:37.903 --> 20:39.821
- Oh, God, we made it.
- [sighs]

20:39.905 --> 20:41.156
I don't know if you noticed,

20:41.240 --> 20:44.159
but, Nick, I've got a real problem
with the pornography.

20:44.243 --> 20:48.163
Yeah. Some old people pissed on us,
and it smelled different.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.207
My guess is
it's all the vitamins they take.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.541
It's all the supplements, yeah.

20:51.625 --> 20:55.045
Then we heard a noise, and me
and my very serious girlfriend, Jessi,

20:55.128 --> 20:57.047
opened the lid and saw a dead body.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.967
- And, uh, you're the girlfriend?
- Uh, not exactly.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.593
Then what is this guy to you?

21:01.677 --> 21:03.387
You're going steady? You pinned her?

21:03.470 --> 21:06.139
- Yeah. What am I to you?
- You're a guy that I kiss sometimes.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.058
That's nothing.
That's a nothing relationship.

21:08.141 --> 21:08.976
Women are dying!

21:09.059 --> 21:12.396
So I want you to define your relationship
by the end of the night.

21:12.479 --> 21:15.107
That noise they heard must have been
our guy dumping the victim.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.776
All the while
we got Coach Steve in custody,

21:17.859 --> 21:22.114
which means, gentlemen,
that he cannot be Jon Bon Ponytail.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.449
You stop trying to make that work!

21:24.533 --> 21:26.785
- Sir, you're free to go.
- [chuckles]

21:26.868 --> 21:28.620
But am I free to stay, my friend?

21:28.704 --> 21:30.664
That don't make no never mind to me.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.625
- Well, I guess we should go home.
- Ugh.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.295
- I don't wanna go home.
- Yeah, me neither.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.838
The dogs probably ate my dinner by now.

21:37.921 --> 21:39.339
What if we don't go home?

21:39.423 --> 21:40.757
You mean, like, go to a movie,

21:40.841 --> 21:42.426
or sneak into the cemetery
and sleep there?

21:42.509 --> 21:44.928
- No.
- I know a pretty empty mausoleum.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.513
I mean, like, get out of here.

21:46.596 --> 21:49.391
Run, child. Run away to Mexico.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.559
We'll live on the beach

21:50.642 --> 21:53.103
and get those weird little braidy things
in our hair.

21:53.186 --> 21:55.147
Let's go somewhere far away.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.732
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.984
Because I am a hundred percent
on board for this.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.111
I have a go-bag right here.

22:01.194 --> 22:03.363
Okay, we need to run
before I change my mind. Let's go.

22:03.447 --> 22:06.116
It's just all loose tortilla chips.

22:07.409 --> 22:08.410
[monster] Hello, Nick.

22:09.536 --> 22:11.997
- [groaning]
- Are you all right? How'd you get out?

22:12.080 --> 22:14.041
- I fucking fucked all those fucks.
- Yeah.

22:14.124 --> 22:16.293
On that note, I think you were right.

22:16.376 --> 22:18.462
I'm not ready for puberty. I'm gonna wait.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.964
Oh, no, no, Nick. It's not your decision.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.008
In fact, check your mons.

22:23.091 --> 22:24.843
- Hey, Nick.
- What it do?

22:24.926 --> 22:26.678
We are your curly new pals.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.139
Are we in Tampa?
'Cause it's hot and stinky.

22:29.222 --> 22:31.475
- I don't wanna be here.
- No, we're not in Tampa.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.351
We're in Crotch City, USA.

22:33.435 --> 22:34.478
Hi, guys.

22:34.561 --> 22:36.104
Does this mean I'm going through puberty?

22:36.188 --> 22:39.900
- Are you gonna be my hormone monster?
- Uh, no, not exactly.

22:39.983 --> 22:42.110
You'll be working with my friend Rick.
Great guy.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.404
- Where is he? Where's the kid?
- What?

22:44.488 --> 22:48.366
He can't even see me.
And there's shit running down his leg.

22:48.450 --> 22:53.163
- We're gonna have a lot of fun, man.
- No, no. I don't accept this.

22:53.246 --> 22:56.917
I'm gonna have my mom call a doctor.
There's gotta be a shot I can take, right?

22:57.000 --> 22:59.920
You want me to teach you
how to masturbate?

23:01.838 --> 23:02.714
[sighs]

23:02.798 --> 23:04.883
Well, one door closes,

23:05.759 --> 23:07.094
and another opens.

23:07.677 --> 23:09.513
- [screams]
- Get down on the ground, you sick fuck!

23:09.596 --> 23:11.890
- Oh, my God, what's happening?
- You're under arrest.

23:11.973 --> 23:13.475
What are you doing to my boy?

23:13.558 --> 23:15.560
I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings,

23:15.644 --> 23:17.604
but your boy here
is a perverted killer, ma'am.

23:17.687 --> 23:18.563
I knew it!

23:18.647 --> 23:23.318
His DNA was found all over a dead body
in the synagogue dumpster. All over.

23:23.401 --> 23:24.778
[gasps] My jizz socks.

23:24.861 --> 23:27.614
There was so much semen,
at first we thought a horse had done it.

23:27.697 --> 23:29.991
I know who you are, you little bastard.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.494
You're the ponytail something.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.496
Guys, please, I'm just some weird kid.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.706
- Detective, check this out.
- Who's this?

23:36.790 --> 23:39.751
- Your next victim?
- That's my associate Susan.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.670
And what the hell is this here now?

23:41.753 --> 23:44.422
That's not mine.
That's the hormone monster's.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.883
Oh, my God. My son is deranged.

23:46.967 --> 23:49.302
Let me guess, the monster did this too.

23:49.386 --> 23:53.390
Yes. He wanted to climax in my wall.
Why am I saying all of this?

23:53.473 --> 23:58.353
Andrew, my son, I can't believe
you made a hole in my drywall.

23:58.436 --> 24:01.064
- Officers, take him away.
- No, guys. Ow, ow!

24:02.774 --> 24:05.902
I'm gonna have to go
to Home Depot on a Sunday.

24:05.986 --> 24:08.822
Why, Andrew? Why?

24:08.905 --> 24:10.157
[cell door rattling]

24:10.240 --> 24:11.908
Hey. How you doing, buddy?

24:11.992 --> 24:13.827
I'm terrified, Nick.

24:13.910 --> 24:17.664
My cellmate called me a pretty shit today.
It's a real mixed message.

24:17.747 --> 24:21.084
[grunts] I think we need
to start accepting and enjoying.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.879
Don't worry, we'll get you out of here.
You're innocent.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.213
You are innocent, right?

24:25.297 --> 24:28.800
'Cause your DNA was found,
like, all over the body.

24:28.884 --> 24:29.885
Under the eyelids--

24:29.968 --> 24:31.553
Nick, of course I'm innocent.

24:31.636 --> 24:35.098
They're saying I'm a serial killer,
but I'm just a chronic masturbator.

24:35.182 --> 24:38.101
Stop quoting my law commercials.

24:38.185 --> 24:40.187
Guy Bilzerian? What are you doing here?

24:40.270 --> 24:43.523
I'm your fucking lawyer,
and you're fucking going home, fucknuts.

24:43.607 --> 24:44.441
I am?

24:44.524 --> 24:45.567
The good news is,

24:45.650 --> 24:47.527
there's security footage
of the real killer

24:47.611 --> 24:49.738
throwing the body
in the synagogue dumpster.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.114
Oh, thank God.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.407
The bad news is,

24:52.490 --> 24:56.077
there's also footage of you
tossing dozens of jizz-soaked socks

24:56.161 --> 24:57.579
in the same dumpster.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.706
And it's gone viral.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.211
- And this is where you fart?
- Yup.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.837
And this is where I picked my nose.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.464
- [Nick laughs]
- [Andrew groans]

25:07.547 --> 25:09.007
How will I face the kids at school?

25:09.090 --> 25:11.801
Look, I know this all seems
embarrassing now, boys,

25:11.885 --> 25:15.722
but maybe one day
you'll look back on this time fondly.

25:15.805 --> 25:18.350
And perhaps even make
something beautiful out of it.

25:18.433 --> 25:21.770
What? Like a show
about a bunch of kids masturbating?

25:21.853 --> 25:24.314
Isn't that basically
just like child pornography?

25:24.397 --> 25:26.233
Holy shit. I hope not.

25:26.316 --> 25:29.110
I mean, maybe if it's animated,
we can get away with it.

25:29.819 --> 25:30.820
Right?

25:37.661 --> 25:38.495
[horn honks]

25:39.204 --> 25:42.207
Y'all can hop in the back,
just shove that shit to the side.

25:42.290 --> 25:43.833
- Oh, thanks.
- Thank you.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.629
Pam? Scorpion?

25:47.712 --> 25:49.923
Jay, who are these pillows?

25:50.006 --> 25:53.009
We're his family.
Who the fuck are you, bitch?

25:53.093 --> 25:54.970
[groans] This is awkward.
