WEBVTT

01:12.781 --> 01:15.116
Yo, boss! Johnny's gotta make water!

01:15.200 --> 01:16.409
No chance, man. Shut up!

01:17.619 --> 01:20.497
Oh, he's peeing!
Johnny's peeing all over the seat!

01:20.580 --> 01:22.957
[prisoner] What are you
fucking around for, man?

01:23.541 --> 01:24.751
[guard] Damn it, Johnny!

01:24.834 --> 01:27.837
[prisoners chattering]

01:27.921 --> 01:30.840
-[guard] Really? What's your problem, man?
-[grunting]

01:31.758 --> 01:34.177
-[straining]
-[prisoner] Get him down!

01:34.260 --> 01:37.388
[grunting]

01:37.472 --> 01:38.807
[shouts]

01:40.558 --> 01:42.143
-[gunshot]
-[grunts]

01:42.227 --> 01:43.645
[engine revving]

01:43.728 --> 01:45.396
[grunting]

01:49.067 --> 01:51.111
[shouting]

01:51.194 --> 01:52.570
[screaming]

01:59.911 --> 02:01.329
[metal creaking]

02:19.013 --> 02:21.766
-[chattering]
-[laughing]

02:40.952 --> 02:42.954
[piano playing off-key]

02:50.044 --> 02:52.505
[Michael] You know,
I always wondered why a piano.

02:53.089 --> 02:56.342
You're supposed to be the edgy one.
Wouldn't a guitar be more, uh…

02:56.426 --> 02:59.888
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Lucifer! Lucifer. Lucifer.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.598
I am not here to fight.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.600
Oh, well, I am most certainly am!

03:03.683 --> 03:06.102
[panting] Well, then what would happen

03:06.186 --> 03:10.690
to all these poor,
fragile humans, dear brother?

03:14.777 --> 03:16.696
[gasps]

03:16.779 --> 03:18.323
It's all right, everyone!

03:18.406 --> 03:21.367
Just a little brotherly squabble.
[chuckles]

03:21.451 --> 03:24.579
-It's fine. It's fine. Music up.
-[dance music playing]

03:24.662 --> 03:28.625
[Michael] And besides,
I mean, really, what's the point?

03:28.708 --> 03:30.043
I've already won.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.420
I've assembled the Flaming Sword,

03:32.503 --> 03:36.090
and thanks to it, and…
[chuckles] …my charms, of course,

03:36.174 --> 03:38.593
I have got
the majority of angels on my side.

03:38.676 --> 03:41.846
And yet, here you are. Why?

03:41.930 --> 03:43.723
To avoid bloodshed, brother.

03:44.641 --> 03:47.602
To keep our siblings safe. To make peace.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.482
I am here with an offer.

03:52.565 --> 03:56.110
[scoffs]
There is nothing that you could offer me.

03:56.194 --> 03:58.571
Hmm. [chuckles]

03:59.572 --> 04:00.615
What about a throne?

04:02.033 --> 04:03.451
[laughs]

04:03.534 --> 04:05.662
Are you offering me my old job?

04:06.537 --> 04:11.084
I take Heaven. You take Hell.
It's kind of poetic if you think about it.

04:11.167 --> 04:14.963
And, uh, I will let you rule down there
however you see fit.

04:15.046 --> 04:17.966
Oh, gee, thanks, bro.

04:18.049 --> 04:20.176
But been there, done that, tried the veal.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.680
Ah-ah-ah!
But I haven't told you the best part.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.766
Chloe will be down there with you.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.103
I mean, talk about happily ever after.

04:30.186 --> 04:32.897
What are you talking about?
That's impossible.

04:33.815 --> 04:37.568
Even if you become God, you wouldn't have
the power to force her soul down there.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.321
Only someone's guilt
can take them to Hell.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.698
Exactly.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.200
Think about it.

04:44.284 --> 04:48.830
The father of her child is dead
because of a case he was working for her.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.794
Did you do all of this?

04:55.670 --> 04:57.171
Did you have them take Daniel?

04:57.255 --> 05:01.175
No, no, no.
That part was just a very happy accident.

05:01.259 --> 05:04.220
But when they
told me they had him… [laughs]

05:04.304 --> 05:07.432
oh, brother,
I realized I had a golden opportunity.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.183
So you--

05:09.726 --> 05:12.562
you told them to kill Dan?

05:12.645 --> 05:13.771
You're welcome.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.024
-[Lucifer inhales]
-[grunts]

05:17.275 --> 05:19.819
[chuckles] Easy with the temper, brother.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.404
Dan is in Hell because of you!

05:21.487 --> 05:23.990
Well, technically,
it's because of his own guilt,

05:24.073 --> 05:25.992
which he really
should've gotten over by now.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.660
[shouts]

05:27.744 --> 05:29.912
Forget about the past, brother.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.998
Focus on the future.

05:32.081 --> 05:33.750
Your future.

05:34.625 --> 05:35.752
With Chloe.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.132
[chuckles]

05:45.386 --> 05:48.097
[Michael] You need time
to think about it. I get it.

05:48.181 --> 05:52.101
But just so you know,
the vote is tomorrow.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.729
And I'm holding it here on Earth
so you can attend.

05:54.812 --> 05:57.690
You know, because of the whole
"you're banished from Heaven

05:57.774 --> 06:00.526
and would be instantly incinerated
if you returned" thing.

06:00.610 --> 06:03.905
[chuckles] Though,
that would be fun to see.

06:05.823 --> 06:06.741
Brother.

06:08.451 --> 06:11.954
I am offering you
a chance at a happy ending.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.333
I hope you take it.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.196
Linda.

06:48.032 --> 06:48.866
[chuckles]

06:50.993 --> 06:51.953
See?

06:52.495 --> 06:54.622
This is what caring about people gets you.

06:54.705 --> 06:58.459
Sitting around like idiots,
getting all emotional over inanimate junk!

06:58.543 --> 07:03.423
So can we please just stop with
the crybaby bullshit and get this done?

07:11.973 --> 07:12.849
[gasps]

07:17.854 --> 07:19.981
[shouts]

07:24.485 --> 07:25.528
[Linda] Maze.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.531
Maze, honey, it's gonna be okay.

07:30.741 --> 07:31.617
What is that?

07:33.744 --> 07:35.663
[sobbing] It's the T-shirt that Dan…

07:37.206 --> 07:40.334
had to steal from Chloe
after I knocked him out

07:40.418 --> 07:43.921
and dumped him naked at her house.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.633
[sobbing] I still…

07:47.717 --> 07:51.429
I still don't know
how he fit his stupid ass in this thing.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.557
[chuckles, sobbing]

07:58.519 --> 07:59.937
I miss him.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.315
-[crying]
-[Linda] Maze.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.108
[sighs] Okay.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.194
[wailing]

08:07.612 --> 08:08.446
Okay.

08:09.697 --> 08:10.740
It's okay.

08:12.658 --> 08:13.701
Okay.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.703
It's true.

08:17.163 --> 08:21.000
It's true,
sometimes when you care about people…

08:22.668 --> 08:25.546
you have to go through pain and loss.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.634
But that's the price of joy.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.012
[Amenadiel] She's right, Mazikeen.

08:33.930 --> 08:38.017
In order for none of us to be sad,
we would have had to have never met Dan.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.729
You wouldn't want that. None of us would.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.190
[sobbing] Mnh-mnh.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.777
Like-- like when…

08:49.195 --> 08:51.447
when Dan and I

08:51.531 --> 08:53.908
pul-- pulverized that gang together.

08:56.786 --> 08:57.995
It was beautiful.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.250
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.085
Exactly.

09:04.168 --> 09:07.296
And remembering, um…

09:09.674 --> 09:11.384
sweet times like those…

09:13.052 --> 09:15.429
are what helps heal the hurt.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.185
[Linda] Because trust me…

09:23.771 --> 09:28.359
never loving anyone
is far worse than loss.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.288
[elevator bell dings]

09:44.083 --> 09:46.794
[Lucifer] Thank you for coming, Detective.

09:46.877 --> 09:49.463
-Yeah.
-Um, how's Trixie?

09:50.673 --> 09:56.012
Uh, she's, you know,
she's with my mom and Dan's parents.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.388
She's a strong little girl.

09:57.471 --> 10:00.349
She's just having to be stronger
than she ever should right now.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.770
Listen, I know
that you asked me to come here,

10:04.854 --> 10:09.275
but I just wanna get
something off my chest first. Um…

10:10.484 --> 10:13.321
You know the argument
the other night, it--

10:14.864 --> 10:19.827
It just-- we were both stressed,
and, um, it was emotional and--

10:19.910 --> 10:22.204
There's no need, Detective.
You were right.

10:22.955 --> 10:27.043
You were able to say
the thing I couldn't admit to myself.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.879
I wanted to be God for the wrong reasons.

10:31.130 --> 10:35.259
But now I know why I need to be God.

10:37.219 --> 10:38.387
For Dan's sake.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.264
What do you mean?

10:42.058 --> 10:43.893
Uh, please. Sit down, please.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.981
[clears throat]

10:50.816 --> 10:52.401
[Chloe clears throat]

10:52.485 --> 10:55.071
So, Dan's…

10:56.155 --> 10:58.658
Dan's death… [exhales]

10:59.867 --> 11:02.286
Everything that's happened
is all Michael's fault.

11:02.870 --> 11:05.456
He's been assembling
the Flaming Sword to win the war.

11:05.539 --> 11:09.460
So that's why they killed Dan,
to keep us from finding that out?

11:10.294 --> 11:11.462
No.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.714
No.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.675
Michael killed Dan…

11:16.509 --> 11:18.552
so that you would feel guilty.

11:19.804 --> 11:23.307
So that when you die,
you'll go down to Hell.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.852
A twisted bribe to get me
to go back like a good little Devil.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.272
I don't even know…

11:31.357 --> 11:33.192
I don't know what to do with that!

11:33.275 --> 11:34.777
You must refuse to give in.

11:35.569 --> 11:36.987
It's all a manipulation.

11:37.071 --> 11:39.490
Detective, you mustn't feel guilty.

11:42.284 --> 11:44.120
Right. Yeah, okay. [sniffles]

11:44.203 --> 11:46.497
I'll just snap my fingers
and not feel guilty.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.457
-I'm serious, Detective.
-I'm serious too.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.252
That is not how emotions work, Lucifer.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.380
Prove me wrong. Go ahead!

11:54.463 --> 11:56.006
Go on! Just…

11:56.090 --> 11:58.884
[inhales] …feel worthy!

11:58.968 --> 12:00.678
[gasping]

12:00.761 --> 12:03.514
Or you know what?
No, this is better. This is better.

12:07.184 --> 12:08.686
Make yourself vulnerable.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.231
-[Lucifer sighs]
-[chuckles]

12:15.735 --> 12:18.571
-It's easier said than done, isn't it?
-This isn't the same.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.491
[inhales] We can't let Michael win,
and you can't end up like Dan.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.870
What are you talking about,
end up like Dan? Dan's in Heaven.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.505
Lucif--

12:38.883 --> 12:40.259
Where is Dan right now?

12:42.803 --> 12:43.637
Where is he?

12:43.721 --> 12:45.389
Don't make me say it, please.

12:47.016 --> 12:50.394
-Where is he?
-[wings flap]

12:50.478 --> 12:51.353
Who's there?

12:52.271 --> 12:53.355
Michael?

12:54.106 --> 12:55.149
Remiel.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.860
-Lucifer.
-Remi!

12:58.444 --> 13:00.905
[gasping]

13:10.164 --> 13:11.373
She's dead.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.709
Oh, my God.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.590
Michael must have
found out she was our spy

13:19.673 --> 13:21.509
and killed her with the Flaming Sword.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.763
Wait, are there
actual flames on the sword?

13:25.846 --> 13:29.809
Detective, this is hardly the time to
start questioning the rules of celestials,

13:29.892 --> 13:33.562
but, yes, the sword has flames on it.
It makes sense. Don't overthink it.

13:33.646 --> 13:37.191
No, I'm only asking because, look,
there's no burn marks around the wound,

13:37.274 --> 13:40.361
so whatever Michael killed her with,
it couldn't have been flaming.

13:40.444 --> 13:43.030
So he must have just used Azrael's blade.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.867
But when I saw Michael,
he said he had the sword.

13:47.785 --> 13:52.540
If he did, the little show-off would have
used it, which means he's bluffing.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.250
He hasn't found the piece yet.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.668
We don't know where it is.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.128
Michael has an army of angels
to search for him.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.339
Maybe Remiel found out
where the piece was.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.508
You think she was coming to tell us that?

14:03.342 --> 14:04.301
I don't know.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.637
[sniffs]

14:08.013 --> 14:10.266
I don't know. This… [sniffs]

14:10.349 --> 14:11.600
…this could be a clue.

14:12.434 --> 14:17.064
Look, I know it's asking a lot,
but I need the detective one last time.

14:17.648 --> 14:18.774
I need your help.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.192
Of course.

14:22.111 --> 14:25.739
Maybe I can't control my guilt,
but I sure as hell can channel my anger.

14:26.323 --> 14:27.783
Let's take that bastard down.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.953
[huffs, shudders]

14:47.887 --> 14:49.346
Hey, big guy.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.767
You took one of the good ones.

14:55.561 --> 14:56.645
And I'm…

14:57.646 --> 15:00.149
I'm glad he's
with you and everything, but…

15:01.901 --> 15:03.444
I just miss him.

15:04.486 --> 15:05.738
I miss him a lot.

15:15.247 --> 15:18.959
And I know you got
a lot on your plate, and…

15:19.835 --> 15:21.420
[sighs] I know. I know.

15:21.503 --> 15:25.299
Darkness makes the light
shine brighter and everything, but…

15:27.009 --> 15:29.011
it's extra dark right now…

15:30.763 --> 15:33.140
and I'm having a really hard time seeing.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.145
It almost feels like…

15:39.521 --> 15:41.315
you're not even up there anymore.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.153
But… [sighs]

15:46.904 --> 15:49.823
I know
that's totally impossible. [sniffles]

15:50.699 --> 15:51.575
So…

15:52.910 --> 15:54.453
I would really appreciate it…

15:54.536 --> 15:55.621
[inhales]

15:56.664 --> 15:58.791
…if you could just show me the way.

15:58.874 --> 16:01.794
Or at least just-- just, you know,

[shudders]

43:36.655 --> 43:38.240
Though not for long, it seems.

43:38.324 --> 43:40.826
Okay, I don't know
what the fork any of that means,

43:40.909 --> 43:43.203
but you look like you could use a hand.

[Lucifer coughs]

43:50.294 --> 43:53.422
The last time I saw you,
you were-- you were in Hell.

43:53.505 --> 43:55.674
Did I fly in the wrong bloody direction?

43:55.758 --> 43:57.384
Nope, you're in the right place.

43:57.468 --> 44:00.721
This is Heaven.
Or at least, one of its many rooms.

44:00.804 --> 44:02.973
I'm still trying to get
the lay of the land.

44:03.057 --> 44:05.643
I hear they have a room
made entirely out of cotton candy.

44:05.726 --> 44:07.311
No, no, no, that's impossible.

44:07.394 --> 44:12.399
No soul has ever
made it up here from there.

44:13.067 --> 44:16.570
I don't know about that,
but I know I took your advice.

44:16.654 --> 44:19.490
I faced my family. My guilt.

44:21.450 --> 44:22.910
You went through the door.

44:22.993 --> 44:24.662
Yep, finally.

44:24.745 --> 44:26.830
And boom, Heaven!

44:26.914 --> 44:30.250
-[both laugh]
-Heaven.

44:30.334 --> 44:32.503
[inhales] Heaven!

44:32.586 --> 44:35.214
[exhales] The detective.

44:35.297 --> 44:39.218
Hey, don't worry, she's here. Come on.

44:39.301 --> 44:41.261
What-- what are you doing?

44:41.345 --> 44:43.889
-Hey, you helped me.
-[gulps]

44:43.972 --> 44:45.015
Let me help you.

44:47.142 --> 44:47.976
There we go.

44:48.060 --> 44:51.522
-Wait, come on, Dad! Come on. Tell me!
-[laughing]

44:51.605 --> 44:54.650
I'm serious.
Your mother's face was completely purple.

44:54.733 --> 44:57.403
She forgot she had
the Althea makeup on.

44:57.486 --> 45:00.072
And no one in the PTA
was brave enough to tell her--

45:00.155 --> 45:02.324
[Lucifer] Detective! Detective!

45:02.825 --> 45:04.451
Thank you. Thank you.

45:05.953 --> 45:06.829
Lucifer.

45:08.914 --> 45:09.790
Lucifer!

45:11.250 --> 45:12.084
What…

45:13.502 --> 45:14.837
Lucifer.

45:16.088 --> 45:17.297
What are you doing here?

45:17.381 --> 45:19.383
[panting] I've come to get you.

45:19.466 --> 45:22.886
It's not your time. You need to come back.

45:26.306 --> 45:27.683
Oh, that's right. The…

45:29.268 --> 45:31.895
-The-- the war, and…
-Yes.

45:31.979 --> 45:33.689
…and I left Trixie…

45:34.815 --> 45:36.442
-and my friends and…
-Yeah.

45:37.067 --> 45:38.277
…I left you.

45:38.360 --> 45:39.778
-Yes.
-But-- but…

45:41.280 --> 45:44.825
my Dad's here,
and I can't-- I can't lose him again.

45:45.951 --> 45:48.871
It's okay. I'm not going anywhere.

45:50.456 --> 45:53.375
But it sounds like some people
could use your help, Detective Decker.

45:55.377 --> 45:57.463
-Thanks, Dad.
-[breathing shakily]

45:58.422 --> 46:01.717
-Okay. Wait! How do we get back?
-[gasps]

46:01.800 --> 46:04.970
[Lucifer] I'm not sure we can.

46:05.637 --> 46:08.766
I'm afraid there's
not enough power left for the both of us.

46:08.849 --> 46:11.351
No, I'm not going without you.
What are you talking about?

46:11.435 --> 46:12.644
[Lucifer] You have to.

46:14.813 --> 46:15.939
You have to.

46:17.649 --> 46:19.735
The world still needs you, Chloe Decker.

46:19.818 --> 46:22.321
-No, you don't have to do that!
-[grunts, pants]

46:23.113 --> 46:26.200
I know. I know I don't have to.

46:28.118 --> 46:29.328
I choose to.

46:30.078 --> 46:31.038
What?

46:32.331 --> 46:35.959
I choose you, Chloe.

[Michael huffs] No way.

48:02.045 --> 48:03.380
He did it.

48:03.463 --> 48:07.009
He actually brought you back. [chuckles]
