WEBVTT

00:03.200 --> 00:06.500
Every body has a story to tell.

00:07.300 --> 00:10.600
Now although this gentleman
died a natural death,

00:10.700 --> 00:11.800
he gave his cadaver

00:12.200 --> 00:14.165
to further your education,

00:14.200 --> 00:18.200
so pay careful attention
to what he has to tell us.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.700
Now, the brain.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.000
Inside,

00:23.300 --> 00:26.800
you will see the delicate
structures and pathways

00:27.000 --> 00:31.200
that determine memories,
emotions, basic motor functions.

00:31.600 --> 00:32.900
In sum,

00:33.200 --> 00:35.000
who we are.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.765
Mr. Palmer would you

00:36.800 --> 00:39.700
cradle the brain while I sever this...?

00:39.800 --> 00:41.700
Lieutenant Greer, the four...

00:41.735 --> 00:43.600
lobes of the cerebrum?

00:44.200 --> 00:45.300
It's the frontal,

00:45.600 --> 00:46.850
the parietal,

00:46.885 --> 00:48.242
occipital

00:48.277 --> 00:49.600
and temporal.

00:52.300 --> 00:56.500
The adult human brain weighs
approximately three pounds.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.500
Feels like a soggy grapefruit.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.500
Yes. Well, pass it around.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.500
Now, don't let its small size fool you.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.100
The cerebral cortex contains one

01:08.200 --> 01:10.665
billion neurons and one

01:10.700 --> 01:13.400
million billion
connections, or synapses.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.100
If you were to count
one synapse per second,

01:17.200 --> 01:20.700
you wouldn't finish counting
for 32 million years.

01:21.300 --> 01:22.400
Doctor,

01:22.500 --> 01:24.600
is this natural?

01:29.700 --> 01:31.000
Certainly not.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.000
What the hell is that?

01:33.400 --> 01:35.100
This, my dear lieutenant...

01:37.100 --> 01:38.100
is murder.

02:23.090 --> 02:24.355
Not bad.

02:24.390 --> 02:27.090
And look at this one. You're
going to love this guy.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.940
Yeah, he would not be safe
with me. I would eat him.

02:30.975 --> 02:33.690
He's so adorable. How can
you say no to that face?

02:35.390 --> 02:37.310
Please tell me you're
looking for a man for Ziva.

02:37.390 --> 02:38.390
Not me.

02:39.090 --> 02:41.090
McGoo, is there something
you want to tell me?

02:41.390 --> 02:43.355
Looking at animal rescue sites.

02:43.390 --> 02:45.290
McGee's thinking about getting a puppy.

02:45.325 --> 02:46.590
Puppy's a lot of work.

02:46.790 --> 02:48.690
You got to feed it, walk it, train it.

02:48.990 --> 02:50.990
Yeah. I'm not 12, all right?

02:51.090 --> 02:53.255
I work hard. I deserve someone who will

02:53.290 --> 02:55.690
jump up all excited when
I get home, you know?

02:56.190 --> 02:57.555
Lay on the couch, watch TV.

02:57.590 --> 02:58.990
Maybe lick my face a little bit.

03:00.490 --> 03:02.490
Might be easier getting a girlfriend.

03:02.590 --> 03:04.690
Which might even be easier with a puppy.

03:07.190 --> 03:08.290
Even for you.

03:08.490 --> 03:11.190
I'm not ready to start taking
tips from you on this yet, probie.

03:11.590 --> 03:14.390
Tony, I think it's time
you get back on that horse.

03:15.290 --> 03:17.490
- Are you getting a pony?
- It's an adage.

03:18.090 --> 03:19.990
I am not familiar with that breed.

03:20.090 --> 03:21.890
Yeah, well, they are quite rare.

03:22.290 --> 03:24.890
Sort of a cross between
a Pegasus and a unicorn.

03:28.190 --> 03:30.490
- So, who's the favorite?
- The Pit Bull.

03:31.590 --> 03:33.690
Yeah, that makes sense
for you, actually.

03:33.890 --> 03:35.290
Not really for McGee.

03:35.690 --> 03:36.990
He's more of a...

03:37.190 --> 03:39.190
Spaniel kind of guy.

03:39.390 --> 03:40.590
Cocker, maybe?

03:42.390 --> 03:44.390
How about an Australian Shepherd?

03:46.390 --> 03:47.790
They're working dogs.

03:49.090 --> 03:50.990
- Pick it up, DiNozzo.
- On it, boss.

03:51.025 --> 03:52.790
A.F.I.P. Smooth things over.

03:54.290 --> 03:55.290
Please hold.

03:55.690 --> 03:58.890
What did we do to incur the wrath of
the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology?

03:58.925 --> 04:00.690
Ducky kept one of their cadavers.

04:00.790 --> 04:02.290
Ducky stole a cadaver?

04:02.390 --> 04:03.790
I'm sure he had a good reason.

04:03.825 --> 04:04.825
I hope so.

04:06.790 --> 04:07.790
Sit.

04:10.390 --> 04:11.390
Stay.

04:13.490 --> 04:14.490
Roll over.

04:20.890 --> 04:23.490
It's absolutely ridiculous, Jethro.

04:23.590 --> 04:26.690
This man's body should never
have been donated to science.

04:27.190 --> 04:28.290
Too late for a refund.

04:28.390 --> 04:29.890
He was murdered, Jethro,

04:30.090 --> 04:33.190
with an injection of mercury
into his brain. A liquid bullet.

04:33.590 --> 04:36.640
Mr. Palmer is presently
endeavoring to reach

04:36.675 --> 04:39.690
the M.E. who made such
a grievous oversight.

04:40.290 --> 04:43.790
- Still no answer, Doctor.
- Then redial, Mr. Palmer.

04:44.390 --> 04:45.155
Yes.

04:45.190 --> 04:47.590
Unidentified African-American male,

04:47.625 --> 04:49.355
approximately 50 years old

04:49.390 --> 04:52.355
blood-alcohol level
zero point one-two.

04:52.390 --> 04:55.790
Official cause of death: Asphyxiation
from the deceased's own vomit.

04:55.890 --> 04:57.355
However, here's the kicker.

04:57.390 --> 05:00.555
They elected not to perform an autopsy.

05:00.590 --> 05:03.690
But it would be pretty hard to find a
pinprick hole in the base of a skull.

05:03.725 --> 05:05.590
And heavy metals wouldn't
show on a tox screen

05:05.625 --> 05:06.990
unless you're looking for them,

05:07.025 --> 05:08.090
specifically.

05:08.490 --> 05:11.890
Mr. Palmer, do not defend
the inefficiency of others.

05:11.925 --> 05:15.290
I'm not sure you can just
take control of a body, Duck.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.390
Well, someone has to.

05:17.490 --> 05:20.690
I mean, based on preliminary
findings, County Police

05:20.790 --> 05:23.190
determined that he
was a nameless drifter.

05:23.225 --> 05:24.390
A John Doe.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.890
Had too much to drink
and died in his sleep.

05:27.290 --> 05:29.490
Some people live their
whole lives off the grid.

05:29.690 --> 05:30.790
No, not our man.

05:30.990 --> 05:33.790
I'd wager that he spent
several years in prison.

05:35.790 --> 05:37.490
Yeah, it's elementary, my dear Jethro.

05:37.590 --> 05:40.690
The proliferation of
scar tissue on his body.

05:41.190 --> 05:42.990
Cigarette-sized burns.

05:43.090 --> 05:45.090
Our John Doe led a violent life.

05:45.190 --> 05:49.390
Yes, well, this long scar
on his left leg is surgical.

05:49.590 --> 05:51.390
However, it healed poorly.

05:51.490 --> 05:53.790
Suggests prison-caliber
medical treatment.

05:53.990 --> 05:55.490
Especially post-operative.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.390
And the tattooing.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.890
Pen ink. Jailhouse style.

06:00.290 --> 06:03.690
Yes. Perhaps we can get Abby to
shed some light on this pattern.

06:03.790 --> 06:05.490
It's her area of expertise.

06:05.890 --> 06:08.590
A John Doe. I mean, it's ridiculous.

06:08.790 --> 06:11.740
It can't be that difficult
to locate a prison record.

06:11.775 --> 06:14.690
Somebody must actually
care that this man is dead.

06:15.190 --> 06:16.190
Well?

06:16.790 --> 06:18.390
Did you locate the M.E.?

06:19.190 --> 06:20.490
No. I gave up.

06:21.190 --> 06:22.690
There in lies the problem.

06:22.890 --> 06:26.190
People are just not
willing to do the legwork.

06:29.190 --> 06:31.090
He had a murder victim
right in front of him,

06:31.490 --> 06:33.690
classroom full of military students.

06:34.090 --> 06:35.990
I think he might be a bit embarrassed.

06:37.090 --> 06:38.790
Excellent detective work.

06:43.890 --> 06:46.990
I hope your opinion of me doesn't
waver after I've given this fellow

06:47.025 --> 06:48.757
- a piece of my mind.
- Never.

06:48.792 --> 06:50.490
I warn you, this might get ugly.

06:51.790 --> 06:54.590
I'm looking for Dr. Jordan Hampton.

06:55.390 --> 06:56.490
You found her.

06:59.890 --> 07:02.190
Is there something wrong
with your telephone?

07:03.190 --> 07:05.140
Wouldn't know. I don't answer it.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.090
Too many bodies, and not enough time.

07:08.490 --> 07:10.255
Special Agent Gibbs,

07:10.290 --> 07:12.490
Dr. Donald Mallard. NCIS.

07:12.590 --> 07:15.790
Pleasure. I assume you're
not here to check on my phone.

07:15.890 --> 07:18.590
Perhaps you'd have a moment
to discuss a John Doe that

07:18.690 --> 07:20.690
crossed your table nine days ago.

07:22.090 --> 07:23.055
Remember the body?

07:23.090 --> 07:25.240
Yeah, I remember every body.

07:25.275 --> 07:27.390
50 something, black male found.

07:27.590 --> 07:30.290
DOA on Highland Pier.
Aspirated on his own vomit.

07:30.590 --> 07:33.890
I assume you kept him
the requisite 72 hours.

07:35.090 --> 07:36.890
No one made any inquiries.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.890
Day two of his stay, I caught
a priority triple homicide.

07:40.190 --> 07:42.390
Day four, Anatomy Board picked him up.

07:42.890 --> 07:43.990
You needed the space.

07:44.090 --> 07:45.790
Not a whole lot of elbow room.

07:45.890 --> 07:47.890
Where he went after that, I can't say.

07:47.990 --> 07:51.690
A.F.I.P., and then, our autopsy suite.

07:52.190 --> 07:54.390
We're investigating
his death as a homicide.

07:55.990 --> 07:56.990
Damn it.

07:57.890 --> 07:59.190
I missed something.

07:59.290 --> 08:01.455
An injection of mercury into his brain

08:01.490 --> 08:04.090
in between the first vertebrae
and the occipital bone.

08:06.590 --> 08:07.855
Police tried

08:07.890 --> 08:09.590
and failed to ID him.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.990
AFIS database and dental record
searches: They came up empty.

08:13.025 --> 08:15.190
- DNA?
- I'm not sure how it goes at NCIS,

08:15.290 --> 08:17.190
around here, that
takes about six months.

08:17.225 --> 08:18.890
Never canvassed the scene.

08:19.190 --> 08:21.090
Sadly, most cops I know,
they prefer to hear,

08:21.190 --> 08:23.490
"case closed" than look
for a reason to open one.

08:23.890 --> 08:25.455
It's not the first time

08:25.490 --> 08:27.590
someone's slipped through the cracks.

08:27.790 --> 08:29.890
Well, I'm glad you
caught him, Dr. Mallard.

08:30.790 --> 08:31.790
As am I.

08:38.590 --> 08:40.990
Yeah, I hope she recovers
from that tongue-lashing.

08:45.690 --> 08:47.390
What do you find under the pier?

08:47.890 --> 08:50.590
85 cents, two batteries
and a bottle cap.

08:50.790 --> 08:53.190
- No mercury, no needle.
- Keep looking.

08:53.690 --> 08:55.490
Got to find someone who knew him.

08:56.890 --> 08:58.590
Highland Beach in October.

08:58.790 --> 09:00.155
How much of a tourist draw.

09:00.190 --> 09:01.990
Soft-shell crab season's almost over.

09:02.025 --> 09:03.790
People really like boats that much?

09:03.890 --> 09:05.590
You work for the Navy, DiNozzo.

09:13.490 --> 09:15.490
Maybe we should start
with this waitress.

09:21.090 --> 09:22.890
Eating or asking questions?

09:24.290 --> 09:27.590
If you were hoping for subtle,
you could have lost the guns.

09:27.990 --> 09:29.190
Or least the hats.

09:30.290 --> 09:31.255
Excuse me.

09:31.290 --> 09:34.890
I'd just like to show you a photo,
see if you recognize this man.

09:37.590 --> 09:38.590
Okay.

09:38.690 --> 09:40.290
You trying to build suspense?

09:40.490 --> 09:41.490
No.

09:42.790 --> 09:46.090
It's just that the man in
the photo is dead, and...

09:47.290 --> 09:49.090
some people find that shocking.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.590
Thanks for being gentle.

09:52.990 --> 09:54.190
I'm a gentle man.

09:55.390 --> 09:56.890
- Seen him?
- Never seen him.

10:01.790 --> 10:05.190
So, the waitress, Miss Shannon
O'Hara, remembers our guy.

10:05.225 --> 10:07.990
Never got a name, paid cash, big tipper.

10:08.090 --> 10:10.890
- How about your biker gang there?
- They're just passing through.

10:11.390 --> 10:13.490
- That's it?
- Yeah, they don't like cops much.

10:16.590 --> 10:18.190
Check out the brunette at the table.

10:18.590 --> 10:19.690
Good eye, boss.

10:19.890 --> 10:22.590
I'll tell you, my radar is just
totally shot. She's smokin'.

10:22.690 --> 10:23.990
That's not what you meant.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.590
You were suggesting that she
seems interested in our presence,

10:26.625 --> 10:29.090
maybe a little too interested,
and that should question her.

10:29.190 --> 10:30.190
Not a problem.

10:32.190 --> 10:33.190
That's a problem.

10:40.590 --> 10:41.990
- Oh, excuse me.
- No, excuse me.

10:42.090 --> 10:44.190
Mind if we ask where you're
going in such a hurry?

10:45.190 --> 10:47.290
What business is it of NCIS?

10:47.390 --> 10:49.690
We're looking for anyone who
might have known this man.

10:51.190 --> 10:52.190
He's dead?

10:53.190 --> 10:54.290
You know him?

10:54.790 --> 10:57.190
His name's Marvin
Hinton. He was with me.

10:57.225 --> 10:58.290
And you are?

10:58.390 --> 10:59.355
Careful.

10:59.390 --> 11:01.090
I was just reaching for my ID.

11:05.690 --> 11:07.690
Special Agent Courtney Krieger.

11:08.090 --> 11:09.890
Hinton was working for the FBI.

11:21.090 --> 11:22.990
Hey, Gibbs, need a refill? I'm going.

11:23.090 --> 11:25.090
We, yeah, Betro.
Thanks, make it a double.

11:25.190 --> 11:26.190
You got it.

11:28.590 --> 11:30.590
Still can't find any
record of Marvin Hinton.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.390
And you won't. Marvin
Hinton doesn't exist anymore.

11:33.590 --> 11:34.590
"Anymore"?

11:34.790 --> 11:37.790
His cellmates swear Marvin Hinton
served six years at Cumberland,

11:37.890 --> 11:40.590
although any record of it vanished
when he was released last month.

11:40.790 --> 11:44.290
We had to reassemble his history
by hand, it's not complete.

11:44.590 --> 11:47.390
He once went by the
name Frederick LeClair.

11:49.190 --> 11:50.955
Hinton aka LeClair.

11:50.990 --> 11:54.490
Bootlegging, false IDs,
resisting arrest, theft.

11:54.890 --> 11:56.290
The guy's a career felon.

11:56.390 --> 11:57.990
Interstate trafficking, primarily.

11:58.025 --> 11:59.590
How did he show up on your radar?

11:59.625 --> 12:00.790
Was a routine tip.

12:01.090 --> 12:03.555
Picked him up offloading
stolen cargo containers.

12:03.590 --> 12:07.040
At which point, you discover a nameless
man whose entire history's been erased.

12:07.075 --> 12:10.490
- No fingerprints, no criminal record.
- Not even a high school transcript.

12:10.525 --> 12:13.255
That's impossible, you'd
need first person access to

12:13.290 --> 12:16.290
a federal mainframe, credit
ratings, countless private companies.

12:16.325 --> 12:18.090
That'd be like taking
spit out of the ocean.

12:18.125 --> 12:19.125
How did he do it?

12:19.190 --> 12:20.290
Claimed he didn't.

12:20.390 --> 12:23.290
Said he was contacted by
someone offering the service.

12:23.390 --> 12:24.590
"The Eraser".

12:25.090 --> 12:26.390
What movie is that from?

12:26.990 --> 12:28.490
I don't know, Flashdance?

12:28.590 --> 12:30.390
Why was Hinton not back in prison?

12:30.490 --> 12:32.790
He was a small fish, but The Eraser...

12:32.890 --> 12:34.290
he's our real target.

12:34.390 --> 12:36.290
We hoped he would contact Hinton,

12:36.325 --> 12:38.190
get paid off and finish the job.

12:38.490 --> 12:40.290
Provide Hinton with a new identity.

12:40.790 --> 12:41.790
Exactly.

12:41.890 --> 12:43.390
I was left to baby-sit.

12:43.690 --> 12:45.190
It was my first field assignment.

12:45.990 --> 12:47.690
Never expected him to be killed.

12:47.890 --> 12:49.490
That is what happens to bait.

12:50.990 --> 12:52.790
Hey, it's not your fault.

12:54.590 --> 12:57.355
So why didn't Hinton skip town
when he had the opportunity?

12:57.390 --> 13:00.240
He was having too good a time on
the government expense account.

13:00.275 --> 13:03.090
But we did have him under 24-hour
monitoring, three-team shifts.

13:03.190 --> 13:05.490
- What changed?
- The Eraser didn't make contact.

13:05.590 --> 13:08.190
They pulled my surveillance
team to chase other leads.

13:08.225 --> 13:09.690
You notify your boss.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.790
We need to know everything you know.

13:14.890 --> 13:16.490
The Bureau set Hinton up here?

13:16.590 --> 13:18.390
It's maintain the
appearance he was flush.

13:18.490 --> 13:20.055
Anyone else have their own key?

13:20.090 --> 13:22.590
No, we met here weekly so
no one would see us together.

13:22.690 --> 13:24.890
He agreed to play along
in exchange for leniency.

13:24.990 --> 13:26.690
But he knew it could be dangerous.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.390
Forget the puppy, McGee.

13:28.990 --> 13:31.790
A place like this is what you
need to score with the chicks.

13:37.490 --> 13:38.490
Here.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.090
Boss, this could be the murder weapon:

13:45.125 --> 13:46.190
Mercury.

13:58.290 --> 13:59.590
Positive for blood.

14:08.390 --> 14:09.355
Fluids.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.690
Lots of them.

14:11.390 --> 14:12.690
No surprise there.

14:13.390 --> 14:14.990
Six years in prison.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.890
The Eraser made the initial
contact at the Crab Shack.

14:19.925 --> 14:21.055
Not face to face.

14:21.090 --> 14:22.455
No, slipped him a note.

14:22.490 --> 14:25.190
So, you sent Hinton back,
hoping for another one.

14:25.590 --> 14:28.690
Hinton was supposed to keep a record
of anyone he came in contact with.

14:29.090 --> 14:31.890
I was running background
checks, chasing down his leads

14:32.190 --> 14:33.590
I was waiting for anything new.

14:33.690 --> 14:34.890
You got your wish.

14:34.990 --> 14:36.390
Your first crime scene.

14:37.690 --> 14:39.390
He was killed in that room.

14:41.690 --> 14:43.390
This is why I love you guys.

14:43.490 --> 14:46.190
You bring me hair, you bring
me blood, you bring me fluids.

14:46.290 --> 14:47.390
And mercury.

14:47.490 --> 14:50.490
Predictable, yet constantly surprising.

14:50.590 --> 14:51.590
We try.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.190
Of course, mercury is toxic,

14:53.290 --> 14:56.390
so you shouldn't let kids break
open thermometers and play with it.

14:56.425 --> 14:58.090
Speaking from personal experience, Abb?

14:58.125 --> 14:59.255
Actually explains a lot.

14:59.290 --> 15:00.990
You want it, but it kills you.

15:01.090 --> 15:02.390
It's like a metaphor.

15:02.590 --> 15:04.790
- It's a cigarette.
- Or chocolate for dogs.

15:05.290 --> 15:06.990
By the way, I like
the dachshund for you.

15:07.090 --> 15:09.490
- You could name him Mercury.
- This mercury, Abby.

15:09.590 --> 15:11.855
Industrial grade, commonly
used in heavy machinery,

15:11.890 --> 15:14.340
although it's fallen out of
favor because of the fear factor.

15:14.375 --> 15:17.032
A lot of it's being dropped on
developing nations like India.

15:17.067 --> 15:19.690
Where exporting/dumping has
become a major revenue stream.

15:19.725 --> 15:22.490
Anyways, um, this is what
killed our painted man.

15:22.590 --> 15:23.890
Speaking of which...

15:24.590 --> 15:28.090
I've seen a lot of great skin art
done with a ballpoint pen and a needle.

15:28.190 --> 15:30.790
Like this and this.

15:30.825 --> 15:31.825
Very nice.

15:32.190 --> 15:34.090
But this guy's tattoo it's,

15:34.290 --> 15:36.790
It's a mess. The symbols are gibberish,

15:36.825 --> 15:39.290
the pattern's haphazard. It's a puzzle.

15:39.390 --> 15:40.655
It puzzles me, Gibbs.

15:40.690 --> 15:41.890
I'm determined to solve it.

15:41.990 --> 15:42.990
Hair samples.

15:43.090 --> 15:44.590
Not nearly as interesting.

15:44.690 --> 15:45.990
Six different women.

15:46.290 --> 15:47.790
Hinton had a lot of girlfriends.

15:47.990 --> 15:50.490
One's a bleach blonde.
One's auburn from a bottle,

15:50.525 --> 15:51.766
if you want to know anything else,

15:51.790 --> 15:53.790
you have to find something
to match it against.

15:59.590 --> 16:00.690
Delivery for Tony.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.290
I got it, I got it.

16:02.390 --> 16:03.390
Thank you.

16:05.390 --> 16:07.190
- Hey, how are you?
- Good, thanks.

16:09.690 --> 16:10.990
Here you go.

16:11.090 --> 16:12.890
Thank you. Have a good night.

16:14.990 --> 16:16.290
Keep the change.

16:20.190 --> 16:22.190
Portobello mushroom, no tomato.

16:24.090 --> 16:26.890
Philly cheese steak,
extra steak, extra cheese.

16:31.090 --> 16:32.790
These are all Hinton's contacts.

16:33.590 --> 16:35.290
Can't help but notice they're all women.

16:36.790 --> 16:39.190
What made him think
The Eraser was a woman?

16:39.290 --> 16:40.790
I don't know that he did.

16:41.290 --> 16:42.890
Well... Cause you know,

16:43.290 --> 16:45.390
you said he was enjoying himself.

16:47.490 --> 16:48.590
You, you...

16:49.090 --> 16:50.790
You have mushroom in your teeth.

16:53.990 --> 16:55.590
Where's your bathroom?

16:56.990 --> 16:58.490
I will show you

16:58.690 --> 17:00.090
where it is.

17:04.890 --> 17:06.790
Hey, so I've been
thinking about the murder.

17:07.690 --> 17:09.089
Why kill him that way?

17:10.390 --> 17:12.440
I mean an injection into the brain,

17:12.474 --> 17:14.732
definitely not the most common method.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.990
To find out "why," you must ask "who."

17:17.589 --> 17:18.690
Someone tidy.

17:18.790 --> 17:20.790
Someone who doesn't like messes.

17:21.190 --> 17:23.390
- You have a theory?
- Someone

17:23.589 --> 17:26.255
who needs to be in constant
control of the situation.

17:26.290 --> 17:29.690
Someone who does not like to
lose control of their emotions.

17:32.090 --> 17:33.690
Ziva, what are you doing?

17:35.190 --> 17:36.655
I'm not an expert here,

17:36.690 --> 17:39.690
but I'm pretty sure what you're
doing now is a violation of the code.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.090
It is not against the law.

17:41.490 --> 17:43.090
The woman's code.

17:43.490 --> 17:46.240
McGee, I bet you if we
take a strand of her hair,

17:46.275 --> 17:48.955
it will match the sample
from Hinton's condo.

17:48.990 --> 17:51.990
Well, of course it would. She's
already said she been there every week.

17:52.090 --> 17:53.390
This woman is uptight.

17:54.390 --> 17:56.390
Not even a single strand.

18:01.090 --> 18:03.090
We will have to go to the source.

18:03.190 --> 18:04.555
Ziva, no hair pulling.

18:04.590 --> 18:07.155
She's the only one that
was in contact with Hinton.

18:07.190 --> 18:10.190
It would have been easy for her
to just sweep him under the rug.

18:10.690 --> 18:11.690
Motive?

18:11.890 --> 18:14.155
She's ambitious. He became
too much of a complication.

18:14.190 --> 18:17.290
When someone's that uptight, it's
only a matter of time before they...

18:17.490 --> 18:18.490
snap.

18:18.590 --> 18:19.590
Okay.

18:20.690 --> 18:21.890
You don't like her.

18:22.390 --> 18:23.355
Do you?

18:23.390 --> 18:25.455
I understand what she's going through.

18:25.490 --> 18:28.490
I remember what it was like to be
green, afraid you're going to mess up.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.990
- Which she did.
- So what, you want to rub it in?

18:31.690 --> 18:34.290
Come on, Ziva, I think she
deserves a little sympathy.

18:36.090 --> 18:37.490
Tony seems to like her.

18:41.390 --> 18:42.990
I do not think Gibbs does.

18:56.990 --> 19:00.390
Who do you work for, Tobias?
Homeland Security or the FBI?

19:00.890 --> 19:03.090
The world's on my shoulders, Gibbs.

19:03.690 --> 19:04.990
World made of paper.

19:06.590 --> 19:07.990
Just throw that anywhere.

19:12.690 --> 19:14.990
Kind of defeats the purpose
of e-mail when you have to

19:15.090 --> 19:16.790
print it all out for the fire anyway.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.655
Yeah. That's why I don't use it.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.290
Really? Not because you can't
figure out how to work it?

19:26.190 --> 19:29.590
I spend most of my time now
coordinating the flow of information.

19:30.290 --> 19:31.290
What can I give you?

19:31.390 --> 19:33.690
Your opinion on Special Agent

19:33.790 --> 19:35.790
Courtney Krieger.

19:39.590 --> 19:40.590
Promising.

19:41.690 --> 19:44.990
Does everything by the book, the book
doesn't show very much imagination.

19:45.390 --> 19:48.290
Definitely a child
of the electronic age.

19:48.590 --> 19:51.390
Currently running a low-level
asset in Highland Beach.

19:52.490 --> 19:53.590
Asset named Hinton.

19:55.290 --> 19:56.990
Okay, what am I missing?

19:57.390 --> 19:58.690
Fact he was murdered.

20:00.590 --> 20:01.890
Marvin Hinton is dead?

20:02.390 --> 20:03.990
I told her to notify you.

20:11.090 --> 20:12.690
You've got to be kidding me.

20:13.090 --> 20:14.290
She sent an e-mail.

20:14.990 --> 20:16.690
It went in my spam folder.

20:17.490 --> 20:18.790
This is serious, Gibbs.

20:19.490 --> 20:22.890
Alive, Hinton was just an ex-con
who made a deal with the devil.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.290
Dead means the devil came to collect.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.490
Devil have a name?

20:26.990 --> 20:28.790
That's just about all he's got.

20:29.090 --> 20:31.390
You ever heard of Kamal Konkani?

20:32.490 --> 20:35.290
Built his reputation in
the early '90s manufacturing

20:35.390 --> 20:37.790
false IDs for IRA bombers.

20:37.890 --> 20:41.390
Moved around Europe one step ahead of
the authorities for the next ten years.

20:41.690 --> 20:43.390
Where he went, death followed.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.190
Been invisible since the millennium.

20:45.290 --> 20:47.190
He made a fortune
working for terrorists.

20:47.290 --> 20:48.790
Hinton wasn't a terrorist.

20:49.090 --> 20:50.890
Game has changed in a decade.

20:51.390 --> 20:55.390
Documents are more sophisticated,
electronic tracking, facial recognition.

20:56.990 --> 20:59.390
We think Kamal was
using Hinton as a test.

20:59.490 --> 21:00.690
A test? For what?

21:01.690 --> 21:02.790
Homeland

21:03.290 --> 21:06.590
picked up chatter from a
training facility in Libya.

21:07.090 --> 21:08.390
A terrorist cell

21:08.690 --> 21:11.690
with assurances of clean
entry onto U.S. soil.

21:11.725 --> 21:13.990
Assurances from Kamal Konkani.

21:14.025 --> 21:15.390
And with Hinton dead...

21:15.490 --> 21:18.390
The only eyes on Kamal
have been closed for a week.

21:27.088 --> 21:29.588
You're telling me that there
are terrorists on the way here

21:29.688 --> 21:31.753
and they could be anyone?
How did this start?

21:31.788 --> 21:34.888
With a dead man named Marvin
Hinton aka Frederick LeClair.

21:34.923 --> 21:36.688
An ex-con looking for a new identity.

21:36.788 --> 21:39.888
A wish your Eraser was more
than happy to accommodate.

21:42.088 --> 21:43.388
My boss looks mad.

21:43.888 --> 21:45.488
He's going to chew you up.

21:45.688 --> 21:47.388
Out. Chew you out.

21:47.688 --> 21:50.688
Maybe not, maybe he's one
of those silent killer types.

21:50.723 --> 21:53.588
- What do you know about this Eraser?
- McGee.

21:54.688 --> 21:58.188
Believed to be a Pakistani national
raised in India and England.

21:58.788 --> 22:00.888
Made his name working with terrorists.

22:00.988 --> 22:02.688
Clean IDs, easy transit.

22:02.988 --> 22:06.888
Facilitated Basque terror attacks
in Spain, IRA bombings in England.

22:06.988 --> 22:09.588
The GIA bombing in France in 1995.

22:09.688 --> 22:12.988
Killed eight, wounded
hundreds, led by Khaled Kelkal.

22:13.188 --> 22:16.988
French authorities identified the man
who made it possible as Kamal Konkani.

22:17.088 --> 22:18.488
That's a lot of "K's."

22:18.588 --> 22:19.688
"K's" are funny.

22:20.088 --> 22:21.153
Agent Krieger.

22:21.188 --> 22:22.888
You ever see The Sunshine Boys?

22:22.988 --> 22:24.853
But they weren't able to put a face

22:24.888 --> 22:26.988
to the name before he
disappeared off the radar.

22:27.023 --> 22:29.688
Apparently, he's relocated to Maryland.

22:29.988 --> 22:32.788
Upgraded his system for
taking people off the grid.

22:32.988 --> 22:35.688
We were tipped off to Hinton.
So it's possible that Kamal

22:35.788 --> 22:37.953
dropped the dime
himself to test his work.

22:37.988 --> 22:40.688
- His work seems impeccable.
- Now he's covering his tracks.

22:40.788 --> 22:43.288
And shopping the service
to terrorists overseas.

22:43.588 --> 22:45.888
I'll monitor the situation
in the training camps,

22:45.923 --> 22:47.888
watch closely for any movement.

22:48.188 --> 22:50.788
I suggest you pick up
Kamal's trail on this end.

22:51.088 --> 22:52.288
No trace. No face.

22:52.388 --> 22:53.688
This ought to be easy.

22:55.488 --> 22:56.788
Special Agent Krieger.

22:56.823 --> 22:57.888
A word.

22:58.588 --> 23:00.153
According to his Interpol bio,

23:00.188 --> 23:02.988
Kamal rarely ventures out of his
safe house once it is established.

23:03.088 --> 23:06.888
Style's cloak-and-dagger. Low-tech.
No cell phone, no electronic messages.

23:06.923 --> 23:08.753
- Smart.
- He prefers to pass notes.

23:08.788 --> 23:12.188
The Bureau provided several intercepted
by the French 12 years ago, coded.

23:12.223 --> 23:14.388
- Abby has them now.
- I don't give a flying crap

23:14.423 --> 23:16.188
what it states in the handbook!

23:16.288 --> 23:18.488
You don't know enough to
make a decision on your own!

23:18.788 --> 23:20.688
That was long overdue.

23:21.088 --> 23:22.653
What have you got against her?

23:22.688 --> 23:25.188
I do not like cleaning
up after other people.

23:25.288 --> 23:27.688
It is very clear what you
would like to have against her.

23:28.188 --> 23:29.288
Excuse me?

23:29.988 --> 23:31.488
You want to sleep with her.

23:31.788 --> 23:32.788
I...

23:33.388 --> 23:34.588
Well, so...

23:35.788 --> 23:36.788
What if I do?

23:37.988 --> 23:39.188
Same old Tony.

23:39.688 --> 23:41.688
I thought the new Tony
wanted something more.

23:41.723 --> 23:43.188
A real relationship.

23:44.588 --> 23:46.453
I was pretending to be someone else.

23:46.488 --> 23:48.888
Yeah, you could have fooled
me. I thought you had grown.

23:48.923 --> 23:50.864
I'm not particularly
interested in outgrowing sex.

23:50.888 --> 23:53.588
Sure it would be nice, Tony.
But it would be meaningless.

23:53.623 --> 23:55.488
Empty. It would be wrong for you.

23:57.088 --> 23:59.488
She's a pretty girl,
but she's just a girl.

24:00.288 --> 24:02.488
The man you were becoming needs a woman.

24:03.488 --> 24:04.888
At least I thought he did.

24:07.288 --> 24:08.788
You believe that? An e-mail!

24:12.188 --> 24:15.588
Perhaps we're looking at this
tattoo from the wrong angle.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.488
I've manipulated the
image every way I can.

24:18.588 --> 24:20.788
I've inverted it. I've
shrunk it. I've stretched it.

24:20.823 --> 24:21.988
I can't figure it out.

24:22.988 --> 24:24.253
Gonna have to mute you Duck.

24:24.288 --> 24:26.888
- Nothing personal.
- No, wait. It's very pecu...

24:28.288 --> 24:29.688
You got something on the tattoo?

24:29.723 --> 24:31.088
It's a work in progress, but...

24:31.188 --> 24:34.488
I did find out something about the
notes that the FBI got from Kamal.

24:34.888 --> 24:37.188
FBI code-breakers couldn't
make anything of the language.

24:37.223 --> 24:38.388
No, neither could I.

24:38.488 --> 24:40.188
But the paper the notes are written on,

24:40.488 --> 24:42.888
it has a curve, so it came
off of some sort of spool.

24:43.188 --> 24:44.388
Cash register receipt.

24:45.088 --> 24:48.488
And Major Mass Spec had a
field day with these smudges,

24:48.788 --> 24:52.288
decided that it's Makki
Ki Roti and Sarson Ka Saag.

24:53.288 --> 24:55.288
Maize-flour bread and
mustard-leaf sauce,

24:55.488 --> 24:57.888
which goes nice with a glass of lassi.

24:57.988 --> 24:58.988
Indian food.

24:59.288 --> 25:00.688
Punjab, to be specific.

25:00.988 --> 25:02.438
Kamal likes his home cooking.

25:02.473 --> 25:03.888
Might add to his profile.

25:04.588 --> 25:06.588
- It's good work.
- Gonna have to mute you.

25:06.888 --> 25:07.953
Don't say "good work".

25:07.988 --> 25:09.988
Not till I figure out
the riddle of the tattoo.

25:17.388 --> 25:18.988
Ziva, can I ask you a question?

25:22.288 --> 25:24.388
Isn't it hard being the
only woman on the team?

25:24.423 --> 25:25.153
No.

25:25.188 --> 25:27.288
God, I wish I had your confidence.

25:29.988 --> 25:31.788
Well, it comes from experience.

25:33.288 --> 25:35.388
The way I'm going, that's
something I'll never get.

25:36.188 --> 25:37.488
Look, Courtney,

25:39.288 --> 25:41.588
they obviously saw
something valuable in you,

25:41.623 --> 25:43.888
otherwise you would not
have made it this far.

25:44.688 --> 25:45.688
Thank you.

25:45.788 --> 25:46.788
But...

25:47.088 --> 25:49.688
stop trying to be perfect.

25:50.388 --> 25:53.888
You will mess up. And occasionally,
you will take a beating.

25:55.688 --> 25:57.688
- And then what?
- Then, you know the expression

25:57.723 --> 25:58.988
"you get back on the horse"?

25:59.588 --> 26:01.288
I competed in equestrian.

26:03.188 --> 26:04.288
Show jumping mostly.

26:06.888 --> 26:08.988
My uncle bred Arabians.

26:12.088 --> 26:13.088
Do we hug now?

26:13.588 --> 26:15.453
Assuming he still likes home cooking,

26:15.488 --> 26:19.188
there are 15 Indian restaurants within
a ten-mile radius of Highland Beach.

26:19.223 --> 26:20.353
Kamal doesn't travel.

26:20.388 --> 26:22.088
Confine the search to walking distance.

26:25.488 --> 26:26.988
There's only one in the vicinity...

26:27.023 --> 26:28.688
Punjab Tandoori.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.388
Man's gotta eat. We know
he's been in the area.

26:31.688 --> 26:33.353
If he's using the same MO,

26:33.388 --> 26:34.988
passing notes. Who's he handing 'em to?

26:35.088 --> 26:36.988
Any chance he's got
people from the old country

26:37.023 --> 26:38.253
workin' on this side?

26:38.288 --> 26:40.888
Makes that restaurant the perfect
place to hang out if he does.

26:40.923 --> 26:42.753
Slim chance he'd be at
the restaurant himself.

26:42.788 --> 26:45.088
Let's keep this one low-key
when we go to scope it out.

26:45.388 --> 26:46.688
Have to go in undercover.

26:48.588 --> 26:50.088
Hi. Table for two, please.

26:50.488 --> 26:51.488
Right this way.

26:51.688 --> 26:53.488
Looks like a nice
place, doesn't it, honey?

26:53.688 --> 26:55.288
Sure does, sweet cheeks.

26:55.488 --> 26:57.188
Hold it steady, I'm gonna zoom in here.

26:59.488 --> 27:00.888
On the waiter, DiNozzo.

27:00.988 --> 27:03.388
Our specials this evening are the...

27:03.588 --> 27:04.588
Masala Chops

27:04.788 --> 27:05.988
and the Lobia Curry.

27:06.188 --> 27:08.588
- The Lobia is my personal favorite.
- And freeze.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.053
Here are the menus,

27:10.088 --> 27:13.488
- I'll be right back to take your order.
- Facial ID should take a second here.

27:13.688 --> 27:14.988
Unless he has been erased.

27:16.488 --> 27:18.088
Ashwin Romji.

27:18.488 --> 27:20.088
Married, father of three.

27:20.188 --> 27:24.088
Resident since 1987,
legal citizen since 1999.

27:24.488 --> 27:27.388
Seems clean. Courtney, can you
get an angle on the kitchen staff.

27:28.488 --> 27:31.288
She looks tense. Think maybe
it should be you in there?

27:32.088 --> 27:33.288
I think she'll do fine.

27:37.688 --> 27:40.088
Act natural. Just a normal date.

27:42.488 --> 27:43.788
Can I tell you a secret?

27:45.588 --> 27:46.588
It's been a while.

27:47.688 --> 27:49.488
Yeah. Me, too.

27:51.488 --> 27:52.888
Work comes first.

27:53.988 --> 27:55.388
Just pretend you like me.

27:56.288 --> 27:57.688
It's not too hard to do.

28:01.588 --> 28:03.088
You have really soft hands.

28:04.088 --> 28:05.288
How is it going, Tony?

28:07.488 --> 28:09.388
- I'm so sorry.
- You know, I...

28:09.988 --> 28:10.988
It's okay.

28:11.088 --> 28:12.988
Good thing we didn't
put the mic in his pants.

28:15.488 --> 28:16.988
I'm just gonna go clean this up.

28:20.088 --> 28:21.588
Not quite how I remember dating.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.388
Feels about par for the course.

28:27.688 --> 28:29.188
Sorry. Sorry, man.

28:29.288 --> 28:30.288
Excuse me.

28:30.888 --> 28:32.588
Didn't get a good look
at the delivery boy.

28:34.488 --> 28:37.588
- Well, looks like they keep him busy.
- Maybe Kamal gets take-out.

28:37.988 --> 28:39.488
Cross-checking the addresses.

28:46.888 --> 28:47.988
Can I help you, sir?

28:49.788 --> 28:50.788
Yeah.

28:52.388 --> 28:53.788
Can we get our food to go?

28:54.088 --> 28:55.388
Because my girlfriend and...

28:57.988 --> 28:59.088
I understand.

28:59.488 --> 29:00.788
It's very naughty.

29:06.388 --> 29:07.588
Stop. Third on the list.

29:08.188 --> 29:09.488
It's a rented apartment.

29:09.688 --> 29:11.788
Look at the name on the lease, McGee.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.488
- Yeah. I see him.
- Check the delivery boy.

29:19.588 --> 29:22.488
Regular dinner delivery
to a Frederick LeClair.

29:22.688 --> 29:24.388
That's a name our
dead guy's used before.

29:24.488 --> 29:25.588
Dead guys don't eat.

29:26.788 --> 29:28.088
So who's using it now?

29:43.288 --> 29:44.588
We can't be this lucky.

29:46.888 --> 29:48.388
Let him make the drop first, Ziva.

29:48.588 --> 29:49.788
Yes, Gibbs. Standing by.

29:50.188 --> 29:51.988
- Okay, take him.
- Moving in.

29:59.988 --> 30:01.688
I was wondering if you could help us.

30:01.788 --> 30:03.088
I'm a bit lost.

30:03.488 --> 30:04.588
Where are you...

30:06.588 --> 30:07.588
What the...

30:08.588 --> 30:09.788
What the hell's going on?

30:22.388 --> 30:23.388
Just dinner.

30:24.088 --> 30:25.138
The door?

30:25.173 --> 30:26.188
Allow me.

30:36.188 --> 30:37.188
Clear.

30:38.788 --> 30:39.788
Clear.

30:40.488 --> 30:41.488
Nobody here.

30:42.588 --> 30:43.688
This is Kamal's place.

30:44.088 --> 30:45.288
Yeah, or it was.

30:45.488 --> 30:46.588
Can't have gone far.

30:49.488 --> 30:50.888
Where's the guy who lives here?

30:51.088 --> 30:52.788
How would I know? I
just deliver the food.

30:52.823 --> 30:54.488
How's he going to eat if he's not home?

30:54.588 --> 30:56.153
It's a standing dinner order.

30:56.188 --> 30:59.488
I drop off his meal every afternoon,
and he pays two weeks in advance.

31:00.588 --> 31:02.088
- So you've seen him?
- Yeah.

31:02.488 --> 31:03.488
Once.

31:03.588 --> 31:05.888
Gave me a big wad of
cash and a good tip.

31:06.688 --> 31:07.788
Can you describe him?

31:08.588 --> 31:09.688
Okay, I guess.

31:11.488 --> 31:12.588
Older black guy,

31:12.988 --> 31:14.838
about my height, maybe a little taller.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.688
What about this guy you seen him before?

31:17.488 --> 31:18.788
Is this a trick question?

31:20.388 --> 31:21.788
That is the guy who lives here.

31:23.188 --> 31:24.288
Frederick LeClair.

31:24.388 --> 31:25.538
Marvin Hinton.

31:25.573 --> 31:26.688
Kamal Konkani.

31:26.988 --> 31:28.388
Our dead guy's our bad guy.

31:28.688 --> 31:29.888
Then who killed him?

31:38.888 --> 31:40.288
Robert Graves.

31:40.888 --> 31:42.088
25 years old.

31:42.388 --> 31:44.288
No aliases, no priors.

31:44.323 --> 31:45.353
No passport.

31:45.388 --> 31:48.388
According to his W4, he's been
working at the restaurant six months.

31:48.488 --> 31:50.288
If you believe everything on paper.

31:53.288 --> 31:54.888
How much longer are we going to do this?

31:55.188 --> 31:56.288
Anxious to get out?

31:56.788 --> 31:58.788
Wasn't planning on spending
the night in custody.

31:58.988 --> 32:00.488
I have a term paper due tomorrow.

32:00.988 --> 32:03.088
Grad student in electrical engineering.

32:03.188 --> 32:05.288
Solid B-minus average.

32:06.588 --> 32:08.188
You grew up in Hagerstown.

32:09.788 --> 32:10.988
Nice neighborhood?

32:12.388 --> 32:14.088
My parents were working class.

32:14.288 --> 32:16.288
I've had jobs since I was 13 and...

32:16.588 --> 32:19.488
I've had to work twice as hard as
the silver spoons to get where I am.

32:19.888 --> 32:21.288
The delivery boy.

32:22.688 --> 32:23.788
What did I do wrong?

32:24.088 --> 32:25.588
Was there something in the package?

32:26.088 --> 32:27.088
Drugs?

32:34.688 --> 32:36.588
He could still be a
courier and not know it.

32:36.988 --> 32:39.088
He delivers information into go-boxes.

32:39.488 --> 32:41.388
Returns with cash that
contains the reply.

32:41.788 --> 32:44.188
And someone else at the
restaurant sends on instructions

32:44.288 --> 32:45.588
to prospective clients,

32:46.088 --> 32:47.088
tucked in a meal.

32:48.288 --> 32:49.688
It doesn't matter how he did it.

32:50.388 --> 32:51.688
Hinton played you.

32:53.888 --> 32:55.788
He was The Eraser all along.

32:57.688 --> 32:59.088
Hinton was Kamal...

33:00.388 --> 33:02.088
that explains his so-called retirement.

33:02.188 --> 33:04.288
- He was in prison.
- Spending his time improving

33:04.388 --> 33:06.388
the technique for eliminating
a person's history.

33:08.188 --> 33:10.388
- Which means.
- He was testing it on himself.

33:11.288 --> 33:13.488
- So, why...
- Let himself be caught

33:13.688 --> 33:14.988
on the trafficking charge?

33:16.688 --> 33:18.488
- And who...
- Killed him?

33:18.588 --> 33:20.688
That... was clearly
not part of the plan.

33:20.788 --> 33:23.388
We were working under the assumption
The Eraser killed his client

33:23.488 --> 33:24.888
to cover his tracks.

33:25.588 --> 33:27.088
What if it was the other way around?

33:27.288 --> 33:29.288
The Eraser was killed
by one of his clients?

33:30.588 --> 33:31.588
Terrorists?

33:31.688 --> 33:33.288
We don't know if they've arrived yet.

33:33.388 --> 33:34.488
Another client, then.

33:35.388 --> 33:38.888
Someone... with a past
they needed to forget.

33:39.188 --> 33:41.088
And once the client's
past had been erased,

33:41.288 --> 33:42.288
he kills Kamal.

33:42.388 --> 33:45.188
To eliminate the only person
who knows his true identity.

33:45.788 --> 33:46.788
Almost.

33:47.088 --> 33:48.688
Not a him, a her.

33:48.888 --> 33:50.988
- One of his girlfriends...
- Was actually a client.

33:51.288 --> 33:52.288
Cute.

33:52.688 --> 33:53.688
She was erased,

33:53.888 --> 33:55.888
- so we don't know anything about her.
- Wrong.

33:56.788 --> 33:58.088
We do know how she kills.

34:05.988 --> 34:07.188
Where is Dr. Mallard?

34:07.288 --> 34:08.788
With our forensic scientist.

34:09.388 --> 34:12.088
I don't think he's ready
to release the body, though.

34:13.288 --> 34:14.688
He really gets into his work.

34:14.888 --> 34:16.553
Yeah, he's turned himself inside out

34:16.588 --> 34:18.987
trying to unscramble the
meaning behind this tattoo.

34:19.888 --> 34:22.388
Dr. Mallard hates to
leave anything unfinished.

34:22.888 --> 34:23.888
Yeah.

34:24.987 --> 34:25.987
Me, too.

34:40.388 --> 34:41.388
Dr. Hampton?

34:42.588 --> 34:43.652
What are you doing?

34:43.688 --> 34:46.588
I would never cut into your body
without your permission, but...

34:46.987 --> 34:49.388
I would appreciate the opportunity to...

34:50.088 --> 34:51.388
perhaps level the scales.

34:52.588 --> 34:53.853
Of course.

34:53.888 --> 34:55.453
You could have come into my lab

34:55.487 --> 34:57.788
flapping and quacking about
miracles I failed to weave.

34:57.888 --> 35:00.288
I assure you that's not in my character.

35:02.288 --> 35:03.288
Shall we...

35:03.788 --> 35:04.788
do this together?

35:08.188 --> 35:10.588
I could only hope that
this makes us even.

35:12.688 --> 35:14.088
I might even owe you one...

35:17.288 --> 35:18.288
Doctor.

35:20.588 --> 35:21.888
The girls have a theory.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.988
The murder does not have
anything to do with terrorism.

35:25.088 --> 35:27.188
It's one of The Eraser's other clients.

35:27.388 --> 35:29.488
So the killer could be
anyone from anywhere?

35:29.788 --> 35:32.188
We have been sifting through
instances involving mercury.

35:32.488 --> 35:34.088
Did not find similar murder, but...

35:34.588 --> 35:36.288
Idaho. Three years ago.

35:36.388 --> 35:39.488
George Barney dies in his sleep
after having a few too many drinks.

35:39.588 --> 35:41.088
Choked to death on his own vomit.

35:41.188 --> 35:42.988
He's buried on his family farm.

35:43.188 --> 35:45.288
Last month, the Barneys
are digging a new well.

35:45.388 --> 35:47.588
It turns out, the groundwater
had been contaminated.

35:47.988 --> 35:49.088
EPA was called in,

35:49.388 --> 35:51.588
traced the source of the
contamination back to a leak

35:51.623 --> 35:52.888
in George Barney's casket.

35:53.288 --> 35:54.288
Mercury.

35:54.588 --> 35:57.288
His young widow had been the
high school science teacher.

35:57.388 --> 35:58.453
She moved on

35:58.488 --> 35:59.788
after his untimely death.

35:59.988 --> 36:01.588
Local cops couldn't track her down.

36:01.688 --> 36:02.888
She killed her husband.

36:03.288 --> 36:05.088
Here's a picture of the grieving wife.

36:06.488 --> 36:07.488
Look familiar?

36:19.288 --> 36:21.588
Do you need me to
identify another photo?

36:23.788 --> 36:24.988
Recognize this person?

36:27.988 --> 36:30.488
Her hair matches one of the
samples from Hinton's condo.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.988
- And the murder has her signature.
- All right, look.

36:33.088 --> 36:34.888
It was a tragedy when my husband died.

36:35.288 --> 36:36.788
The entire town thought so.

36:38.488 --> 36:40.988
Doesn't sound like you
share their sentiments.

36:42.488 --> 36:44.588
They didn't know what he
was like when he was drunk,

36:45.188 --> 36:46.488
which was all the time.

36:46.888 --> 36:49.888
So when the opportunity presented
itself to start a new life,

36:50.388 --> 36:51.388
you took it.

36:52.288 --> 36:53.288
Wouldn't you?

36:53.588 --> 36:55.688
How did Marvin Hinton
know you were on the run?

37:00.488 --> 37:02.388
He knew everything about me in one look,

37:03.088 --> 37:04.288
everything that matters.

37:05.488 --> 37:07.288
He knew how I'd gotten my new name.

37:08.688 --> 37:10.588
He said he'd been
contacted the same way.

37:11.988 --> 37:13.388
So you went home with him?

37:14.288 --> 37:15.388
Did it occur to you

37:15.788 --> 37:17.988
that he was the one who
set up your new identity?

37:18.023 --> 37:19.388
That he was toying with you?

37:20.888 --> 37:22.988
'Cause he was the only one
who knew about your past.

37:23.288 --> 37:24.288
Right?

37:27.088 --> 37:28.188
I didn't kill him.

37:30.088 --> 37:33.088
I suppose it wouldn't be any
fun if she just admitted it.

37:33.788 --> 37:34.788
Yes, sir.

37:35.288 --> 37:36.588
Delivery boy still here?

37:36.788 --> 37:38.188
Waiting in the conference room.

37:38.223 --> 37:39.488
Make sure he gets home.

37:40.488 --> 37:41.588
Special Agent Krieger.

37:44.788 --> 37:45.788
Nice work today.

37:54.688 --> 37:56.088
She killed once for a new life.

37:56.123 --> 37:57.153
Why not twice?

37:57.188 --> 37:58.888
Did us a favor... Kamal is dead.

38:00.388 --> 38:02.688
It doesn't seem to bother
his international clients.

38:02.723 --> 38:04.055
The terrorist training camp?

38:04.090 --> 38:05.388
Marine task force just went in.

38:05.688 --> 38:06.553
And?

38:06.588 --> 38:07.653
One terrorist killed.

38:07.688 --> 38:09.788
They found an American
passport on his body.

38:09.823 --> 38:11.188
It went through squeaky clean.

38:11.588 --> 38:12.988
Kamal had completed the job.

38:13.023 --> 38:14.388
What about the rest of the cell?

38:14.688 --> 38:16.138
Too late. Already gone.

38:16.173 --> 38:17.553
They're on their way here.

38:17.588 --> 38:20.288
And the only man who knows who
they are is past telling us.

38:20.488 --> 38:22.288
That's not certain, Tony.

38:22.788 --> 38:25.488
Our dead man may have
one thing left to say.

38:28.288 --> 38:29.953
We cracked it, Gibbs, me and Ducky.

38:29.988 --> 38:32.188
We solved the puzzle. We
were just looking at it wrong.

38:32.223 --> 38:33.588
Yeah, it was Jordan...

38:35.688 --> 38:36.688
Dr. Hampton

38:36.888 --> 38:40.588
who had the idea of excising
the section of inked flesh.

38:40.788 --> 38:42.053
That is so gross.

38:42.088 --> 38:43.988
But what we found is so cool.

38:44.288 --> 38:46.388
The blotchy thick, blue jailhouse dye...

38:46.588 --> 38:48.088
that's just a camouflage.

38:48.188 --> 38:50.188
Yes, the real clue is underneath,

38:50.888 --> 38:53.288
hidden like a
painted-over Monet canvas.

38:53.488 --> 38:57.088
All I had to do was eliminate
the blue to clarify it.

38:58.388 --> 38:59.388
This...

39:00.488 --> 39:01.988
is the original tattoo.

39:02.988 --> 39:05.088
It's beautiful, with deeper needling.

39:07.388 --> 39:08.488
Professional work.

39:08.788 --> 39:10.588
It's a masterpiece,
it's a Blaine Parker.

39:10.688 --> 39:12.788
He's something of a
legend, Boston artist.

39:13.288 --> 39:15.288
A man like Hinton trying
to shed his past...

39:15.323 --> 39:16.753
So I talked to Parker's assistant,

39:16.788 --> 39:19.088
and she was able to
determine the exact dates

39:19.188 --> 39:20.788
when Hinton got the original tattoo.

39:21.088 --> 39:23.088
Over a period of several days,

39:23.688 --> 39:24.888
ten years ago.

39:25.488 --> 39:28.088
Interpol's timeline, puts
Kamal in London ten years ago.

39:28.388 --> 39:29.488
Hinton's not Kamal.

39:29.988 --> 39:31.288
Delivery boy lied to us.

39:31.388 --> 39:34.488
He did more than that, he set us up.
He wanted us to believe it was Hinton.

39:34.688 --> 39:36.088
You think the kid's Kamal?

39:36.388 --> 39:38.288
He'd have had to start
when he was 8years old.

39:38.323 --> 39:40.055
Not if he's the new.

39:40.090 --> 39:41.788
Dread Pirate Roberts.

39:41.988 --> 39:43.288
I love The Princess Bride.

39:43.488 --> 39:45.888
No one would ever surrender
to the Dread Pirate Westley.

39:51.688 --> 39:54.188
The Dread Pirate Roberts
picks a successor,

39:54.488 --> 39:57.088
then trains him, starts
calling him Roberts and then

39:57.588 --> 39:59.788
settles into a cushy retirement.

40:00.088 --> 40:02.288
It's the name "Kamal"
that sells the business.

40:04.188 --> 40:05.588
You can let me off up here.

40:15.188 --> 40:16.788
Sorry for the inconvenience.

40:17.788 --> 40:19.388
Just a case of mistaken identity.

40:19.788 --> 40:21.488
- Good luck on your term paper.
- Thanks.

40:23.788 --> 40:24.888
Ziva, where are you?

40:24.988 --> 40:26.388
Dropping off Graves, Gibbs.

40:26.588 --> 40:27.588
Don't!

40:43.588 --> 40:44.588
Can we hug now?

40:55.588 --> 40:56.688
From your closet.

40:59.188 --> 41:00.388
Special delivery.

41:02.988 --> 41:04.088
How'd you find Kamal?

41:05.488 --> 41:06.588
You don't find Kamal.

41:07.088 --> 41:08.088
Kamal finds you.

41:08.988 --> 41:10.688
He tempts you with
the money or the power?

41:11.088 --> 41:12.988
Or just the chance to
become somebody else?

41:13.588 --> 41:15.088
Kamal could tell you needed him.

41:16.788 --> 41:17.788
He needed me.

41:18.788 --> 41:21.188
He can't even work his own
computer. Man's a dinosaur.

41:22.188 --> 41:23.588
He knows how to read people.

41:23.788 --> 41:24.788
Cover his tracks.

41:26.188 --> 41:27.688
But you don't have the discipline.

41:28.888 --> 41:30.088
Hinton figured you out.

41:30.988 --> 41:32.688
He would've led the FBI right to you.

41:32.888 --> 41:34.788
So you killed him
before he got the chance.

41:35.888 --> 41:37.288
Made us think he was Kamal.

41:37.988 --> 41:40.288
Then you framed another
client for his murder.

41:40.388 --> 41:43.388
Shannon O'Hara, aka Karen Barney.

41:43.488 --> 41:46.188
You knew how she'd killed in the
past. She was your first client.

41:49.588 --> 41:50.588
Good for you.

41:51.788 --> 41:53.188
You've got the whole story.

41:55.588 --> 41:57.288
The worst mistake you made...

41:58.688 --> 42:00.588
You tried to shoot our agents.

42:04.688 --> 42:06.788
Hey, let me hang that
up for you, Tobias.

42:11.588 --> 42:12.588
Sit down!

42:17.488 --> 42:19.588
- What do you want?
- The rest of your client list.

42:20.088 --> 42:21.888
Tell us where to find the real Kamal!

42:23.288 --> 42:24.288
Now!

42:30.588 --> 42:32.088
I was at an embassy party once...

42:32.488 --> 42:34.988
gated, razor wire, surveillance
system, the whole deal

42:35.388 --> 42:38.088
and this guy just walks in
the front door, wearing T-shirt

42:38.388 --> 42:39.688
that says "Liquor Store."

42:39.888 --> 42:41.288
Holds up a brown paper bag,

42:41.888 --> 42:42.888
and he goes.

42:43.188 --> 42:45.688
"Did anybody order a bottle of vodka?"

42:47.188 --> 42:49.288
The places you can access
when you look the part.

42:50.388 --> 42:52.788
- This thing starts kind of slow.
- I'm sure it gets better.

42:54.488 --> 42:55.688
The picture's up, boss.

42:56.988 --> 42:58.588
An NCIS production.

42:59.188 --> 43:01.188
Brought to you by Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

43:01.988 --> 43:03.888
Starring, as usual, the FBI,

43:04.288 --> 43:06.088
and the elusive Kamal Konkani.

43:07.388 --> 43:08.388
Freeze it.

43:10.388 --> 43:12.488
The Dread Pirate Roberts, I presume.

43:13.988 --> 43:15.188
Did you get her number?

43:16.088 --> 43:17.188
Who, Courtney? No.

43:19.488 --> 43:20.488
I did.

43:20.588 --> 43:22.088
She wants to learn how to fight.
