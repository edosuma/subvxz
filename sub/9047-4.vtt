it was "illuminating."

08:22.903 --> 08:25.036
- You went into detail
about our sex to your dad?

08:25.038 --> 08:26.938
- No, I meant my paper.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.206
And, no, I didn't.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.976
And my dad didn't speak
to anyone.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.211
He...Left a message.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.246
- What number did he call?

08:34.248 --> 08:35.580
- The one
from the student directory.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.282
- Nice.
[claps hands together]

08:37.284 --> 08:38.250
It's a landline.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.885
They never use it,
and I can delete it from here.

08:39.886 --> 08:42.453
- I was grateful that matty
could erase my dad's message

08:42.456 --> 08:44.656
And put the whole thing
to bed,

08:44.658 --> 08:45.690
So to speak.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.359
- Do you know what this is?

08:47.361 --> 08:48.393
Or this?

08:48.395 --> 08:52.230
These are photos
of warts and lesions

08:52.232 --> 08:53.131
On a vagina.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.432
- Dad, our food
will be here soon.

08:54.434 --> 08:59.037
Can we, um, put away
the infected...Genitalia?

08:59.039 --> 09:00.171
- I wish we could.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.239
But you need to be aware

09:01.241 --> 09:03.508
Of what could happen
now that you and matty

09:03.510 --> 09:05.577
Are engaging
in sexual intercourse.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.913
And, you know, the more
intercourse that you have...

09:07.915 --> 09:09.347
- Please stop saying
"intercourse."

09:09.349 --> 09:12.317
- The higher your chances are
to have a vagina

09:12.319 --> 09:13.685
That looks like this.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.086
[doorbell rings]

09:15.088 --> 09:18.290
- Dad, got the message.

09:19.458 --> 09:23.895
And apparently,
so did matty's parents.

09:26.599 --> 09:28.967
- What do you have to say
to mr. And mrs. Hamilton?

09:28.969 --> 09:35.440
- I'm sorry I-I took
your daughter's virginity.

09:35.442 --> 09:38.109
- Thank you.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.878
- Jenna?

09:39.880 --> 09:40.812
- What?

09:40.814 --> 09:42.847
- [softly]
apologize.

09:42.849 --> 09:45.850
- [softly]
for what?

09:45.852 --> 09:49.621
I am sorry for...

09:49.623 --> 09:52.958
Letting him...Take it?

09:52.960 --> 09:54.159
- Okay.

09:54.161 --> 09:57.062
I think that about takes care
of that, hmm?

09:57.064 --> 09:59.564
- We appreciate the phone call.
[doorbell rings]

09:59.566 --> 10:01.766

10:03.437 --> 10:05.303
Hi!

10:05.305 --> 10:07.539
Thank you very much.

10:10.943 --> 10:11.910
[sighs]

10:11.912 --> 10:13.845
- Okay, let's go.
- Yes.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.380
- You're welcome
to stay for dinner.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.448
- No, we can't.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.248
My mom has...

10:17.250 --> 10:18.550
Salmon thawing at home.
- Oh.

10:18.552 --> 10:20.018
- Thank you
for the invitation.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.019
We couldn't impose.

10:21.021 --> 10:24.055
- [scoffs]
it's not an imposition.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.391
- I do like chinese.

10:27.860 --> 10:31.463
- Okay.
- All right.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.531
- Okay.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.968
- What...Is...Happening?

10:36.970 --> 10:38.637
- This is what's gonna happen.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.138
For the next few games...
[overlapping chattering]

10:40.140 --> 10:42.641
We do mostly chants,
but not lame ones.

10:42.643 --> 10:45.443
And when we build,
we do three turtle tubs

10:45.445 --> 10:46.745
With one dragon roll
in front of it.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.547
Can everyone calm
the [bleep] down now?

10:49.549 --> 10:52.450
- I should be back
by this weekend.

10:52.452 --> 10:55.920
Does anyone have some food?

10:55.922 --> 10:56.755

I'm about lissa's size.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.525
If you want me to step in...

11:00.527 --> 11:02.060
- I don't think teachers
can be on the squad.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.462
- Cheerleader law is fluid
in some areas.

11:04.464 --> 11:07.932
And, yes, faculty can step in
in cases of injury,

11:07.934 --> 11:09.901
Pregnancy, or bear fever.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.236

to a vote.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.905
All those in favor
of an alternate...

11:13.907 --> 11:15.573
- No vote.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.243
I am the captain.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.378
- You're not going to be able
to buy your way

11:20.380 --> 11:22.914
Out of this one, sadie.

11:22.916 --> 11:27.185

of calling the alternate?

11:27.187 --> 11:28.920
Opposed?

11:31.824 --> 11:33.958
- I'm raising my hand.

- Come on.
How bad can this alternate be?

to do it with you.

11:54.448 --> 11:55.847
But I was waiting
on something.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.949
But that was before
I was made a cheerleader.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.784
And right now, I am
too excited to wait.

11:59.786 --> 12:02.087

- I am a cheerleader!

12:02.089 --> 12:04.556
I'm ready. Okay?

12:04.558 --> 12:06.191
- Okay!

12:12.264 --> 12:13.665
- So when y--

12:13.667 --> 12:16.134
When you got
kevin's message,

12:16.136 --> 12:18.937
I guess it was
quite a shock, huh?

12:18.939 --> 12:19.938
- Well, ahem, yes and no.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.040
I mean, I've found things.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.576
And by "things,"
I mean "condom wrappers."

12:24.578 --> 12:25.977
- Mom.
- Well, on the one hand,

12:25.979 --> 12:27.979
You know it's gonna happen
eventually.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.381
On the other--
"wrappers"?

12:30.383 --> 12:32.584
That sounds like
a lot of condoms.

12:32.586 --> 12:36.788
Have you
had multiple partners?

12:36.790 --> 12:37.455
- Yeah.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.890
- How many partners
have you had?

12:38.892 --> 12:40.692
- [thinking] maybe some things
were meant to go public.

12:40.694 --> 12:43.728
Yeah, how many?
- Ah, a few.

12:43.730 --> 12:47.866

- Homestretch.

to not be grandparents
