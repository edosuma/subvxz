00:01.044 --> 00:03.264
<i>Previously on "Reginald the Vampire"...</i>

00:03.351 --> 00:04.352
What's your story?

00:04.439 --> 00:05.744
<i>I let down and hurt</i>

00:05.831 --> 00:07.616
anyone who's ever meant
anything to me.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.574
You lied to me.
You could have been brave.

00:09.661 --> 00:12.273
Instead, you chose deception.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.405
- Welcome to the Slushy Shack.
- You're alive.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.929
I was your friend,
and you made me your meal plan.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.757
You try being a vampire
and see how that goes.

00:18.844 --> 00:21.064
You did those things
because you're an asshole.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.805
I want you to make
me human again.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.676
Now, I'm the closest
thing to a god as they come,

00:24.763 --> 00:27.027
but that request you're asking
is way above my pay grade.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.593
I'm ready to go home, Maurice.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.117
We're probably both
could end up dead.

00:30.204 --> 00:32.206
I'll think of something.
It's what I do.

00:38.342 --> 00:39.648
We're shorthanded
again tomorrow.

00:39.735 --> 00:40.823
Would you mind
working a double?

00:40.910 --> 00:42.346
I'm already doing a double.

00:42.433 --> 00:43.695
Like, currently, during
this very conversation,

00:43.782 --> 00:46.046
I'm on my second
consecutive shift.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.438
Can you do another shift?

00:47.525 --> 00:49.440
I've got plans.

00:49.527 --> 00:51.573
Um, vampire hunting
isn't plans.

00:51.660 --> 00:52.965
It's not hunting.
It's sleuthing.

00:54.097 --> 00:55.751
Enjoy your slushy.

00:55.838 --> 00:57.231
Make the new guy do it.

00:57.318 --> 00:58.797
There is no new guy.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.103
And trying to prove
that monsters exist

01:00.190 --> 01:02.366
isn't sleuthing.
It's delusional.

01:02.453 --> 01:04.107
There's really no new guy?

01:04.194 --> 01:06.022
I could swear you did
an interview this morning.

01:06.109 --> 01:07.937
Yeah, I did two.

01:08.024 --> 01:09.852
Should I hire the influencer
who's available

01:09.939 --> 01:11.680
for three hours
every second Thursday,

01:11.767 --> 01:13.290
or the 42-year-old who said,

01:13.377 --> 01:15.640
and I quote,
"Maybe I could supervise."

01:15.727 --> 01:17.077
Ugh.

01:20.254 --> 01:22.995
They called Galileo
delusional, and he was right.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.085
Did you know
Galileo was his first name?

01:25.172 --> 01:26.390
In case you didn't, now you do.

01:26.477 --> 01:28.218
Ash, please.

01:28.305 --> 01:30.307
I know that you've been
working a ton lately,

01:30.394 --> 01:33.267
but Reginald's gone and Todd--

01:33.354 --> 01:35.095
Yeah, I guess
sleuthing can wait.

01:37.749 --> 01:39.360
How's my pinch?

01:39.447 --> 01:40.839
Still not as good
as the last guy's.

01:45.975 --> 01:47.281
Do you ever miss him?

01:49.761 --> 01:51.546
Sometimes a person comes

01:51.633 --> 01:55.463
into your life and just shines,
you know?

01:55.550 --> 01:57.769
They're like the sun
wrapping you up

01:57.856 --> 01:59.902
in the glow of a summer day,

01:59.989 --> 02:04.559
and all you want to do is
stay there and feel the warmth.

02:04.646 --> 02:08.345
But the sun doesn't shine
for you, you know?

02:08.432 --> 02:11.261
It doesn't care
about you in particular.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.829
And it sure as hell
doesn't care if it burns,

02:13.916 --> 02:16.179
so do I miss getting burned?

02:16.266 --> 02:18.312
No.

02:18.399 --> 02:20.009
Yeah, I miss him, too.

02:21.271 --> 02:22.881
<i>Hark, vampire citizens,</i>

02:22.968 --> 02:25.797
I have news
of great import and joy.

02:25.884 --> 02:28.670
What did I tell you
about being a pompous asshole?

02:28.757 --> 02:31.499
It is with absolute pleasure
that I introduce

02:31.586 --> 02:34.458
the new director
of the Midwest region,

02:34.545 --> 02:36.939
Evangeline Elwood.

02:39.028 --> 02:41.683
What the hell?
Eve?

02:41.770 --> 02:45.774
Angela, darling,
it's so good to see you.

02:45.861 --> 02:47.558
I'm sure you have
a million questions,

02:47.645 --> 02:50.431
but rest assured,
I am here to serve.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.564
You've been served.

02:57.786 --> 03:00.354
I'm being reassigned
to the Yukon?

03:00.441 --> 03:01.920
As my replacement.

03:02.007 --> 03:03.357
The Council wanted
to feed on your heart,

03:03.444 --> 03:04.923
but I convinced them
that you're far

03:05.010 --> 03:06.664
too valuable an asset to eat.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.536
- Your beneficence--
- Cut the shit, both of you.

03:08.623 --> 03:10.233
Eve, what the hell is this?

03:10.320 --> 03:11.974
Angie, what did you think
would happen

03:12.061 --> 03:13.454
when you failed
to punish the fat vampire

03:13.541 --> 03:15.456
for missing
his original Assessment?

03:15.543 --> 03:16.935
Kill everyone he loves.

03:17.022 --> 03:18.372
That's standard protocol.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.896
I am aware
of standard protocol.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.767
Which makes your decision
to ignore it

03:22.854 --> 03:24.726
all the more damning.

03:24.813 --> 03:27.946
Sure, it's sweet, you did so at
the behest of Maurice Miller.

03:28.033 --> 03:32.081
Personally, that man can
beg me any old time.

03:32.168 --> 03:34.692
How did you f--

03:34.779 --> 03:36.564
oh.

03:36.651 --> 03:38.348
Vermin.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.959
Darling, really?

03:41.046 --> 03:42.874
Mercy?

03:42.961 --> 03:44.746
We don't do mercy.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.138
That's a fatal error
best exhibited

03:46.226 --> 03:48.097
by parents and priests.

03:48.184 --> 03:51.883
But in your case,
that was the last straw.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.016
Goodbye, Midwest region.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.539
Hello, Yukon.

03:55.626 --> 03:57.324
No hard feelings, right?

03:57.411 --> 03:59.717
None at all,
Regional Director Elwood.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.806
Call me Eve.

04:04.461 --> 04:05.767
You have until the end
of the week to move your shit

04:05.854 --> 04:07.943
out of my house.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.640
I know I said
atonement was, like,

04:09.727 --> 04:13.122
my jam now,
but maybe we should wait

04:13.209 --> 04:14.602
a little more time before--

04:14.689 --> 04:16.995
Reggie, no time
like right this minute.

04:17.082 --> 04:18.693
Your Assessment is back
on the books.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.956
When you say
"back on the books?"

04:21.043 --> 04:22.523
Friday morning.

04:23.741 --> 04:26.222
Three and a half days
until our certain doom.

04:26.309 --> 04:27.310
Nothing's certain.

04:29.138 --> 04:30.922
Okay, ticking clock.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.446
Whole new approach.

04:32.533 --> 04:33.838
No more skipping rope,

04:33.925 --> 04:36.188
more like prepping
for the SATs.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.929
No one dies
for failing the SATs.

04:38.016 --> 04:40.236
The thing about the SATs is
there's a whole industry

04:40.323 --> 04:43.370
around studying for them--
practice tests, study guides,

04:43.457 --> 04:44.980
that sort of thing.
- Look, we went over this.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.590
All that information
is privileged.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.462
For my Assessment, sure,

04:48.549 --> 04:50.638
but what about
past Assessments?

04:50.725 --> 04:52.857
I know they're all different,
but maybe there's something

04:52.944 --> 04:54.381
in there that can
save our lives.

04:55.643 --> 04:56.948
I'll see what I can dig up.

04:58.341 --> 04:59.951
Now, you go do the right thing.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.967
That'll be $11.85.

05:16.054 --> 05:18.100
Perfect.

05:24.236 --> 05:26.021
Hey!
You're not dead!

05:26.108 --> 05:28.371
Hey!

05:28.458 --> 05:30.025
You're--you're not mad at me?

05:32.897 --> 05:33.985
I was mad.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.639
Then I thought you were dead.

05:35.726 --> 05:37.337
Then I was scared.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.164
And I can't believe
you disappeared like that.

05:39.251 --> 05:41.036
Everyone was super worried.

05:41.123 --> 05:42.472
Everyone?

05:49.827 --> 05:51.263
Hey.

05:53.875 --> 05:57.052
Uh, I--I like what you did
with your hair.

05:57.139 --> 05:58.619
You're fired.

06:00.577 --> 06:03.275
Wait, is--is Todd--

06:03.363 --> 06:05.843
You don't know, do you?

06:05.930 --> 06:07.149
Of course you don't.

06:07.236 --> 06:09.456
You've been gone.

06:09.543 --> 06:12.372
Todd tried to kill himself,

06:12.459 --> 06:13.721
right here in the Slushy Shack.

06:15.549 --> 06:18.465
He tried,
as in he didn't succeed--

06:18.552 --> 06:21.076
which, I mean,
obviously is still terrible,

06:21.163 --> 06:23.600
but it would have been
so much worse.

06:23.687 --> 06:26.168
Todd's alive.

06:26.255 --> 06:27.996
Todd's in the break room.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.954
He comes in every day.

06:30.041 --> 06:33.001
He just sits there, all alone.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.220
But he won't come out here.

06:35.307 --> 06:38.485
He can't because he's afraid.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.358
Any idea why?

06:45.448 --> 06:47.494
Give her time, big guy.

06:56.111 --> 07:00.376
Hey, there... buddy.

07:00.463 --> 07:01.856
Oh, shit.

07:03.161 --> 07:04.641
It's you.

07:04.728 --> 07:05.947
It's you!

07:06.034 --> 07:07.078
Stay away!
- Todd--

07:07.165 --> 07:09.037
Stay away!

07:09.124 --> 07:10.647
Oh, please, please,
don't kill me.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.214
I--I'm begging you, man.

07:12.301 --> 07:13.650
For all that is holy, just--

07:13.737 --> 07:16.000
just don't take any more
of my blood.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.917
I tried to tell them
what you are.

07:20.004 --> 07:21.745
They thought I was--

07:23.965 --> 07:25.749
All it got me was
a 5150 psych hold,

07:25.836 --> 07:26.968
which let me tell you,

07:27.055 --> 07:28.709
is no one's idea
of a good time.

07:28.796 --> 07:30.406
- Did you tell Sarah?
- No, I didn't tell Sarah.

07:30.493 --> 07:32.103
The medical community
already thinks I'm crazy.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.018
I'd prefer to limit the damage
to my reputation.

07:34.105 --> 07:36.456
So how do you know
I'm a vampire?

07:36.543 --> 07:39.067
Dude, you drank my blood,

07:39.154 --> 07:42.505
like, almost all of it.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.159
And I didn't glamour you
to forget.

07:44.246 --> 07:45.813
Make me forget?
Wh--why are you saying that

07:45.900 --> 07:47.336
like that's just
something you can do?

07:47.423 --> 07:49.730
It's something I can do,
like a perk.

07:53.255 --> 07:57.694
Are there any other perks?

07:57.781 --> 07:59.261
Okay, wh--when did this
happen to you?

07:59.348 --> 08:01.132
How could you even keep it
a secret from--

08:02.394 --> 08:04.135
Hang on.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.790
Did you erase my memory before?

08:06.877 --> 08:09.967
- No, no.
- You erased my memory.

08:10.054 --> 08:12.579
That makes so much sense.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.537
You're here to do it again,
aren't you?

08:14.624 --> 08:16.583
You're gonna wipe my mind
like a chalkboard.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.062
No, no.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.499
I'm not gonna
erase anything, okay?

08:19.586 --> 08:21.109
I--I don't do that anymore.

08:22.589 --> 08:25.853
Besides, Maurice was
actually the one

08:25.940 --> 08:27.898
who erased most
of your memories when he--

08:27.985 --> 08:29.857
Whoa, whoa, hold up.

08:29.944 --> 08:32.033
Maurice is a vampire too?

08:32.120 --> 08:33.469
You deserve
to know the whole truth.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.689
That actually makes
a lot of sense.

08:37.995 --> 08:40.128
Oh, my God.

08:40.215 --> 08:43.131
You're here
to finish the job, huh?

08:43.218 --> 08:45.002
Don't you have any other
intake options, man?

08:45.089 --> 08:46.526
I mean, I'm sure my blood
tastes awesome, but, like--

08:46.613 --> 08:49.659
Todd, I'm not here
to finish anything.

08:51.313 --> 08:52.967
I'm here to make amends.

08:58.146 --> 09:00.322
Whoa.
What are you doing?

09:03.325 --> 09:05.719
Drink my blood.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.895
It'll heal you.

09:07.982 --> 09:10.158
This another perk?

09:10.245 --> 09:11.551
Yeah.

09:13.335 --> 09:15.206
How do I know this
isn't another trick

09:15.293 --> 09:17.513
to just get me close enough
to rip my throat out again?

09:17.600 --> 09:20.124
If I wanted to,
it would already be done.

09:20.211 --> 09:21.212
Fair point.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.042
Creepy as hell, but I hear ya.

09:27.305 --> 09:29.046
Okay.

09:36.314 --> 09:38.708
I feel like this is
a really weird dream.

09:38.795 --> 09:39.970
Welcome to my world.

09:51.373 --> 09:52.722
Whoo!

09:52.809 --> 09:55.116
Oh!

09:55.203 --> 09:59.468
Whoa!
Reggie, that is crazy, dude.

09:59.555 --> 10:00.861
I cannot believe that.

10:00.948 --> 10:02.950
Dude, you're like
a wonder drug.

10:03.037 --> 10:06.606
I have never felt so alive.

10:09.391 --> 10:11.349
How do I look?
- All better now.

10:13.569 --> 10:17.355
What?
That is crazy.

10:17.442 --> 10:21.925
Look, I'm sorry
for everything I did.

10:22.012 --> 10:25.102
I'm sorry I didn't appreciate
what you did for me.

10:25.189 --> 10:28.410
You were a friend when I needed
one and I betrayed you.

10:29.803 --> 10:30.804
I won't do that again.

10:37.724 --> 10:38.986
So...

10:47.168 --> 10:48.648
Welcome to the Slushy Shack.

10:48.735 --> 10:49.953
How may I help you?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.395
What the hell
are you doing here?

10:57.482 --> 10:58.570
We had a deal.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.268
You spare Reginald's friends,

11:00.355 --> 11:03.097
and I bring him back
for his Assessment.

11:03.184 --> 11:04.533
What's with the suitcase?

11:04.620 --> 11:07.362
I'm familiar with our deal.

11:07.449 --> 11:08.885
Wait, you found him?

11:10.844 --> 11:12.715
Good for you, Maurice.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.282
Now---- off.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.156
There's one more thing.

11:19.243 --> 11:21.245
You're still here.

11:21.332 --> 11:23.726
I need access
to the archives.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.206
Reginald wants to read
through histories

11:25.293 --> 11:26.816
of the past Assessments.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.210
Those old books aren't going

11:29.297 --> 11:32.909
to help him pass or survive.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.215
Look, I told him
it was a long shot,

11:34.302 --> 11:35.390
but he wants to look anyway.

11:35.477 --> 11:37.000
It's not a long shot.

11:37.087 --> 11:39.046
It's impossible.

11:40.308 --> 11:43.267
And if you were half as smart
as you think you are,

11:43.354 --> 11:45.922
you'd be halfway
around the world by now.

11:49.012 --> 11:51.623
Reginald is my progeny.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.626
I'm gonna stand by him
no matter what.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.155
Believe it or not,
you taught me that.

12:01.242 --> 12:04.201
After what I did, you could
have left me in Oakland--

12:04.288 --> 12:06.638
should have,

12:06.726 --> 12:08.162
but you didn't.

12:09.554 --> 12:12.166
All right, Maurice,

12:12.253 --> 12:14.690
access to the archives.

12:14.777 --> 12:18.825
But do not let Eve find out.

12:18.912 --> 12:22.263
Eve?

12:22.350 --> 12:24.439
What's with the suitcase

12:24.526 --> 12:27.572
is I got relocated
to the----ing Yukon.

12:29.966 --> 12:32.360
And all because
I let you talk me

12:32.447 --> 12:34.971
into sparing everyone
your boy loves.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.799
What you did was
a good thing,

12:36.886 --> 12:38.235
the right thing.

12:40.063 --> 12:43.066
Turns out mercy
is a fatal error.

12:46.722 --> 12:49.290
You ever wonder if you're
playing for the wrong team?

12:51.335 --> 12:52.815
Team?

12:52.902 --> 12:54.295
There are no teams.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.863
There are only enemies.

12:56.950 --> 13:00.040
My entire existence,
I have been surrounded

13:00.127 --> 13:02.433
by people who wanted
to take my power,

13:02.520 --> 13:05.045
people who wanted me dead.

13:05.132 --> 13:08.744
But you--you were different.

13:12.313 --> 13:16.360
Until you wanted me dead
just like everybody else.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.805
Hello, Penelope.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.632
Something I can do for you?

13:27.719 --> 13:29.939
Thank goodness you're here.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.854
I was worried he'd do
something stupid.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.769
I mean, of course, he's going
to do something stupid,

13:33.856 --> 13:36.119
but if you talk to him,
maybe he won't wind up

13:36.206 --> 13:38.121
getting himself,
or even worse,

13:38.208 --> 13:40.471
getting me killed.

13:40.558 --> 13:41.646
What are you talking about?

13:41.733 --> 13:43.126
Who are you talking about?

13:47.043 --> 13:49.176
- Wick.
- Maurice's friend.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.352
- Mike.
- Whatever.

13:51.439 --> 13:53.049
Is that what I think it is?

13:54.703 --> 13:57.749
Mind if I give you
a little unsolicited advice?

13:57.837 --> 14:01.188
Maybe you noticed,
I'm down an arm.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.625
I'm missing that limb because
a certain lady found out

14:03.712 --> 14:05.540
that I'm dealing
in what you came here for.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.499
I got off lucky.

14:08.586 --> 14:11.415
Are you feeling lucky, Mike?

14:17.682 --> 14:18.727
Lucky enough.

14:27.127 --> 14:28.955
- Angel's Blood.
- Oddly enough,

14:29.042 --> 14:30.739
I originally acquired that
for another client

14:30.826 --> 14:33.437
with whom you are familiar.

14:33.524 --> 14:36.179
Oddly enough, this blood is
intended for the same target.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.534
We're officially boned.

14:45.493 --> 14:46.886
Nothing?

14:46.973 --> 14:48.583
A resounding amount
of nothing.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.628
I've read the minutes
of every past Assessment,

14:50.715 --> 14:52.935
every single one
of the vampire histories,

14:53.022 --> 14:55.329
which, by the way,
read a lot more

14:55.416 --> 14:56.808
like erotica than history.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.506
- Accurate too.
- I've even read

14:58.593 --> 15:01.726
all the vampire bylaws,
thousands of them.

15:01.813 --> 15:06.122
So while in theory,
I'm ready to take the bar,

15:06.209 --> 15:08.255
there isn't a single loophole
that will help me pass it.

15:09.865 --> 15:12.563
Reggie, did you talk
to Sarah?

15:12.650 --> 15:15.784
I--um, sort of.

15:15.871 --> 15:18.569
We said hi,
and then she fired me.

15:18.656 --> 15:19.657
But what does that have
to do with anything?

15:19.744 --> 15:21.311
Stop.

15:21.398 --> 15:22.878
Look, I don't care
about your personal life,

15:22.965 --> 15:24.749
but if you're telling me
you read 14,000 pages...

15:24.836 --> 15:26.447
14,297.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.101
And came up empty,

15:28.188 --> 15:29.363
then it's not
because there's nothing.

15:29.450 --> 15:30.973
It's because you're distracted.

15:31.060 --> 15:31.974
What if she doesn't
want to talk to me?

15:32.061 --> 15:34.194
Again, don't care.

15:34.281 --> 15:35.978
Go tie up your loose ends,

15:36.065 --> 15:37.893
and then get your head
back in the game

15:37.980 --> 15:39.982
like our lives depend on it.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.856
Closing time, huh?

15:44.944 --> 15:47.337
You need any help?
Something I could do?

15:49.426 --> 15:51.863
So, um, I think I owe you
an explanation.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.778
No, Reginald,
you really don't.

15:53.865 --> 15:55.519
No, I think I do,
and if you could just stop

15:55.606 --> 15:58.087
and listen for 60 seconds,
it's all I need.

15:59.784 --> 16:01.699
Okay, wow, I didn't think
you'd actually stop.

16:01.786 --> 16:03.527
- You have 50 seconds.
- Got it.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.312
I guess I have to do this now.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.879
Direct and to the point,
no buildups.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.403
Uh, no softening the blow.

16:09.490 --> 16:10.839
40 seconds.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.277
I'm a vampire.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.758
I wasn't always
like that, but--

16:16.845 --> 16:18.499
a--a vampire, I mean.

16:20.283 --> 16:22.285
I got turned the night
we were supposed to go

16:22.372 --> 16:24.331
on our first date,

16:24.418 --> 16:27.116
which you don't remember, right.

16:27.203 --> 16:29.379
That's something else
I have to explain.

16:29.466 --> 16:33.688
Vampires have this power
called glamouring.

16:33.775 --> 16:35.907
Basically, we have the power

16:35.995 --> 16:39.476
to influence people
in major ways.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.826
The reason why you had
all these memory gaps

16:41.913 --> 16:44.003
is because someone--not me,

16:44.090 --> 16:47.180
glamoured you
into forgetting how you feel.

16:47.267 --> 16:50.226
Someone glamoured me

16:50.313 --> 16:53.012
into forgetting
how I felt about you?

16:53.099 --> 16:54.622
It's hard to believe, I know.

16:54.709 --> 16:57.364
No, no, it's not.

16:57.451 --> 16:58.452
No.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.456
You know, actually,
it makes a lot of sense,

17:02.543 --> 17:03.457
if you think about it.

17:03.544 --> 17:04.719
Let me think about that

17:04.806 --> 17:06.242
for a minute.

17:06.329 --> 17:09.158
Yeah, thinking.
Still thinking.

17:09.245 --> 17:11.987
Give--just a couple
more seconds of thinking.

17:13.815 --> 17:16.948
How stupid do you think
that I am, huh?

17:17.036 --> 17:20.300
Like, on a scale of one
to ten, how stupid?

17:20.387 --> 17:21.953
No, that's--
that's not at all.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.520
Are you sure?

17:23.607 --> 17:26.871
Because you just told me
that you were a vampire.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.570
It's the truth, I swear.

17:29.657 --> 17:32.877
The truth
is that you lied to me.

17:32.964 --> 17:35.750
And when you got caught,
you left town.

17:35.837 --> 17:39.449
So I guess that makes you
a coward too, huh?

17:39.536 --> 17:43.236
Yeah, a coward and an asshole.

17:43.323 --> 17:47.196
And now you're back, which is
really confusing for me

17:47.283 --> 17:50.330
because it's all
that I ever wanted,

17:50.417 --> 17:54.508
for you to come back
and open up and be honest.

17:54.595 --> 17:58.642
And sure, it was always
gonna be a big mess,

17:58.729 --> 18:00.731
but at least I'd know
the truth.

18:00.818 --> 18:03.647
So I'm sorry, Reginald.

18:03.734 --> 18:07.303
You don't get to tell
me some insane story

18:07.390 --> 18:10.524
and then swear that it's true.

18:10.611 --> 18:13.309
I'm done with your lies.

18:13.396 --> 18:14.876
I'm done with your truth.

18:14.963 --> 18:18.358
I am just... done.

18:23.580 --> 18:24.973
Sa--

18:32.328 --> 18:34.113
As much as it flatters me,

18:34.200 --> 18:35.244
are you sure you can risk

18:35.331 --> 18:36.811
bringing me home like this?

18:38.204 --> 18:39.422
It's not my home anymore.

18:39.509 --> 18:40.858
There's a story behind that.

18:40.945 --> 18:43.252
Now, you're gonna tell me

18:43.339 --> 18:44.949
until you make me forget.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.386
Not this time.

18:49.824 --> 18:50.955
Listen to me.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.611
Remember.

18:54.698 --> 18:58.137
Remember everything
I have ever told you.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.012
Oh.

19:09.496 --> 19:10.584
No.

19:10.671 --> 19:12.629
Now you know.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.902
Reginald never showed up
for his Assessment.

19:24.989 --> 19:27.905
And now he's back,

19:27.992 --> 19:29.646
not that it matters.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.694
The Council has transferred me
to another time zone.

19:33.781 --> 19:35.348
Why?

19:35.435 --> 19:36.653
It doesn't matter now.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.655
You're leaving town?

19:38.742 --> 19:40.701
Will I ever see you again?

19:40.788 --> 19:42.703
Maybe glamour me
a sudden desire

19:42.790 --> 19:46.054
to travel or a work trip?

19:46.141 --> 19:48.839
I can leave the kids at home.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.406
I'll go wherever you want.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.321
No more glamouring for you.

19:54.149 --> 19:55.977
This really is goodbye,
isn't it?

19:57.718 --> 19:59.415
Thank you for giving me back
my memories.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.638
All of your stories.

20:04.725 --> 20:08.555
If it is any consolation,

20:08.642 --> 20:12.428
I have no intention of going
gently into that good night.

20:12.515 --> 20:17.433
Think of it like me burning
the place down on my way out.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.958
But what if you get
caught in the flames?

20:21.045 --> 20:23.570
What--

20:23.657 --> 20:25.920
Then I go out
in a blaze of glory.

20:26.007 --> 20:30.098
Oh, you--
you really have changed.

20:30.185 --> 20:32.056
The Angela I met
all those years ago

20:32.143 --> 20:34.581
wouldn't burn the place down.

20:34.668 --> 20:37.453
She would make her enemies
set themselves on fire.

20:49.639 --> 20:50.988
I'm a vampire.

20:55.428 --> 20:56.559
Listen to me.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.174
<i>Vampires have this power
called glamouring.</i>

21:06.134 --> 21:07.570
<i>Basically, we use it
to influence people</i>

21:07.657 --> 21:09.659
<i>in major ways.</i>

21:31.246 --> 21:33.161
Show me your fangs.

21:33.248 --> 21:34.641
Hey, Sarah.

21:34.728 --> 21:36.599
You said that
you were a vampire.

21:36.686 --> 21:39.298
Vampires have fangs,
and I want to see them.

21:39.385 --> 21:43.606
Look, about what I said...

21:43.693 --> 21:47.131
maybe we should just forget
about all of that, okay?

21:47.218 --> 21:49.395
I'm a clueless asshole,

21:49.482 --> 21:53.921
and you can consign me
to the dustbin of your history.

21:54.008 --> 21:57.272
Show me, Reginald.

22:01.885 --> 22:03.060
Oh.

22:09.763 --> 22:11.199
You were telling me the truth.

22:11.286 --> 22:13.723
Can I put my teeth away now?

22:17.466 --> 22:21.296
If you lied,
this would be so much easier

22:21.383 --> 22:23.690
for me to wrap my head around

22:23.777 --> 22:26.562
because you'd be
a lying shitbag,

22:26.649 --> 22:29.652
but you're
a truth-telling shitbag.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.483
You're my
truth-telling shitbag.

22:34.570 --> 22:37.443
But I'm not saying that I want
to get back together.

22:37.530 --> 22:40.184
I'm not sure that I'm ever
gonna be ready for that,

22:40.271 --> 22:44.232
but so much has happened.

22:45.668 --> 22:48.149
Look, can I just come in and--

22:51.370 --> 22:55.939
As much as I want you to...

22:56.026 --> 22:57.158
I don't think you should.

22:59.334 --> 23:02.468
I'm a vampire and you're human,

23:02.555 --> 23:06.123
so this is what's best.

23:19.006 --> 23:20.834
Oh, hell no.

23:20.921 --> 23:22.357
Hello, Reginald.

23:22.444 --> 23:23.880
You're here to kill me,
aren't you?

23:23.967 --> 23:25.926
The Assessment's not
until another 36 hours.

23:26.013 --> 23:27.493
I'm pretty sure this is
a violation of governing bylaw,

23:27.580 --> 23:29.495
and believe me,
I know every one.

23:33.934 --> 23:35.501
Open them.

23:40.027 --> 23:43.247
It's everything you need
to know about your Assessment.

23:43.334 --> 23:45.336
Everything I could find, anyway.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.295
I figure you had
a better chance of passing

23:47.382 --> 23:48.731
if you knew the shape
of the thing.

23:50.167 --> 23:51.473
Holy motherload.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.693
You're welcome.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.956
Why?
I mean, thank you,

23:56.043 --> 23:59.438
but how do I know
this isn't a trap?

23:59.525 --> 24:01.831
You don't.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.364
Beware of Greeks
bearing gifts.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.062
Or alternatively,
vampire monsters

24:15.149 --> 24:16.498
who hate the ground I walk on.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.197
I spoke to Angela yesterday.

24:20.284 --> 24:22.112
She didn't say anything
about this.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.724
But maybe this is
a good thing.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.377
Oh, this is better than good.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.728
This is the Holy Grail.

24:28.815 --> 24:31.034
That's what bothers me.
- Angela's got an angle.

24:31.121 --> 24:32.645
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.560
Yeah, Angela's
always got an angle,

24:34.647 --> 24:36.431
but here we are.

24:36.518 --> 24:37.911
I--I'm confused.

24:37.998 --> 24:39.869
Are we trusting Angela now?

24:39.956 --> 24:42.176
No.
No, no, no, hell no.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.612
Okay, but as it stands,

24:43.699 --> 24:45.179
this is the best shot
we've got,

24:45.266 --> 24:47.442
so why don't you just dig in,
see what's what,

24:47.529 --> 24:50.401
and I'll try and find out
what Angie's up to.

24:50.489 --> 24:51.577
Watch me work.

25:00.455 --> 25:01.935
That's your plan,

25:02.022 --> 25:03.545
dose Angela's wine?

25:06.200 --> 25:08.071
Gotta say,
there's poetry in it,

25:08.158 --> 25:09.899
considering she pulled that
shit on me in this very room.

25:09.986 --> 25:12.293
If you care about
saving Reginald's life,

25:12.380 --> 25:14.208
you won't try to stop me.

25:15.949 --> 25:18.299
Killing Angela won't
stop the Assessment.

25:18.386 --> 25:20.214
You came here to kill her.

25:20.301 --> 25:21.911
I'm just finishing
what you started.

25:21.998 --> 25:24.697
Funny thing, turns out
revenge has a shelf life.

25:24.784 --> 25:26.350
When Angela takes a debt,

25:26.437 --> 25:28.439
she makes sure
it's never repaid.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.530
The evil that she's done
that I've been a party to,

25:31.617 --> 25:33.314
I need to be free of that.

25:33.401 --> 25:35.055
I get it.
I really do.

25:35.142 --> 25:37.797
But right now,
I need Angela alive.

25:37.884 --> 25:39.929
Trust me, okay?

25:44.281 --> 25:45.544
Okay.

25:53.029 --> 25:55.075
What do you want, Todd?

26:01.211 --> 26:02.473
Did I ever tell you
about my dad?

26:02.561 --> 26:04.475
I'm not sure why you would.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.783
He was a bull on steroids,

26:07.870 --> 26:08.871
minus the steroids.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.438
Which makes him a bull.

26:10.525 --> 26:12.396
The man could bench 450
in his sleep,

26:12.483 --> 26:14.485
run a marathon
before breakfast.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.487
This one time,
we were camping,

26:16.575 --> 26:19.534
and a bear wandered
onto our campsite.

26:19.621 --> 26:24.670
My dad punched it right
in the face--

26:24.757 --> 26:26.585
an actual bear.

26:28.804 --> 26:31.198
Mm, I guess he was
a bull on steroids.

26:31.285 --> 26:33.722
Course, that bear killed him.

26:36.507 --> 26:37.552
Damn.

26:38.988 --> 26:40.947
Yeah, it was--

26:42.557 --> 26:44.037
It was awful.

26:46.822 --> 26:48.345
Worst thing I ever saw.

26:50.043 --> 26:52.175
I don't want to get killed
by a bear.

26:54.525 --> 26:55.831
I want to live forever.

26:58.965 --> 27:00.923
I want you
to make me a vampire.

27:04.100 --> 27:05.885
I knew it.

27:05.972 --> 27:07.713
Reginald's a vampire,
and that means vampires exist,

27:07.800 --> 27:10.367
so that means I was right.

27:10.454 --> 27:12.239
This explains so much.

27:12.326 --> 27:14.284
It does?

27:14.371 --> 27:15.938
When Reginald
texted us saying

27:16.025 --> 27:17.505
that he wanted to have
a party at the Slushy,

27:17.592 --> 27:19.028
I thought, that's weird.

27:19.115 --> 27:20.377
- Right?
- But now don't you see?

27:20.464 --> 27:22.815
It's his vampire
coming out party.

27:22.902 --> 27:24.730
He didn't seem like
he was in the party mood

27:24.817 --> 27:25.818
when I went to go see him.

27:25.905 --> 27:27.994
Was this before or after

27:28.081 --> 27:29.865
you stomped all over his heart?

27:29.952 --> 27:31.562
I didn't stomp.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.695
I was very gentle.

27:33.782 --> 27:36.002
You asked to see his fangs,
he shows you his fangs.

27:36.089 --> 27:39.701
And then you said,
"Thanks for nothing.

27:39.788 --> 27:42.878
Peace out forever, Nosferatu."

27:42.965 --> 27:45.489
I'm paraphrasing.

27:45.576 --> 27:49.276
But then he said,
"It's better this way."

27:49.363 --> 27:50.843
Why would it be better?

27:50.930 --> 27:52.496
Because love
is a fiction created

27:52.583 --> 27:56.022
by greeting card companies
to sell greeting cards.

27:56.109 --> 27:58.154
He told me the truth.
I got closure.

27:58.241 --> 27:59.895
We're done.

27:59.982 --> 28:02.115
Except, I can't shake the fact

28:02.202 --> 28:04.595
that he's holding
something back again.

28:06.423 --> 28:09.426
Other than being a vampire,
what's left to hold back?

28:11.211 --> 28:12.560
Hard to argue with that.

28:12.647 --> 28:15.563
Admit it, I would make
a great vampire.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.565
- It's not gonna happen, Todd.
- Why not?

28:17.652 --> 28:19.698
I am fit.
I'm fine.

28:19.785 --> 28:22.875
I'd make an awesome addition
to the undead community.

28:22.962 --> 28:24.920
I mean, my organizational
skills alone could be--

28:25.007 --> 28:27.575
You'll be stuck
in place forever.

28:27.662 --> 28:28.837
All right, ask Reggie.

28:33.189 --> 28:35.017
And now you're shirtless.

28:35.104 --> 28:36.584
Why in the hell wouldn't
I want to be stuck like this?

28:36.671 --> 28:38.760
Because you're an idiot.

28:38.847 --> 28:40.980
Yeah, but I'm a happy idiot.

28:41.067 --> 28:43.286
Isn't that what counts?

28:43.373 --> 28:44.635
Come on.

28:46.072 --> 28:48.857
If you made me a vampire,

28:48.944 --> 28:50.946
then we could--

28:51.033 --> 28:52.731
We could what?

28:58.171 --> 29:01.565
This is the best version
of me.

29:01.652 --> 29:05.178
It is all downhill from here.

29:05.265 --> 29:08.529
No matter what I do,
I'm gonna get older.

29:08.616 --> 29:10.226
And I'll look
in that mirror one day,

29:10.313 --> 29:11.880
and I'm gonna see a stranger
looking back at me.

29:14.143 --> 29:15.841
But not today.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.061
Today, I'm perfect.

29:22.499 --> 29:24.850
I'm sorry, Todd.

29:24.937 --> 29:27.461
I can't help you.

29:39.038 --> 29:40.561
It's open.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.219
Sorry I'm late.

29:46.306 --> 29:47.786
I got delayed.

29:49.091 --> 29:50.614
You're stressed.

29:50.701 --> 29:51.702
Angela----ed us, didn't she?

29:51.790 --> 29:53.052
We got nothing?

29:53.139 --> 29:54.793
Oh, it's not nothing.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.142
It's everything.

29:56.229 --> 29:57.621
A detailed year-by-year
breakdown

29:57.708 --> 29:59.145
of every Assessment test,

29:59.232 --> 30:01.451
including benchmarks
I needed to pass,

30:01.538 --> 30:04.324
info on all the vampire guests.

30:04.411 --> 30:07.501
Take Logan the Crepuscular,

30:07.588 --> 30:09.459
Deacon of the Council
of the Americas,

30:09.546 --> 30:12.811
whose hobbies include
decapitation, disemboweling--

30:12.898 --> 30:15.030
And dancing.

30:15.117 --> 30:17.206
Well, you should
see him tango.

30:17.293 --> 30:19.339
Next, we have
the sun chamber.

30:19.426 --> 30:20.644
What happens
in the sun chamber?

30:20.731 --> 30:23.473
I'm glad you asked.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.127
As you can see
by this detailed rendering,

30:25.214 --> 30:27.086
someone is chained to a post,

30:27.173 --> 30:29.958
and, oh, they're on fire.

30:30.045 --> 30:31.655
So basically,
that's where I'll die.

30:31.742 --> 30:33.788
Oh, but not before
Logan the Duplicitous adds in

30:33.875 --> 30:36.573
a little light knife torture
because why not

30:36.660 --> 30:38.184
make a meal
of my painful death?

30:38.271 --> 30:40.229
Hey.
Look, take a breath.

30:40.316 --> 30:42.666
Focus on the test.

30:42.753 --> 30:43.842
You said there were benchmarks.

30:45.931 --> 30:48.803
Historically speaking,

30:48.890 --> 30:51.545
these are just tests designed
for me to fail.

30:51.632 --> 30:54.243
Okay, then you need
to think of a plan

30:54.330 --> 30:56.942
not to pass, to survive.

30:57.029 --> 30:59.292
I thought of several,
but nothing that doesn't end

30:59.379 --> 31:01.424
in one or both of us dying.

31:01.511 --> 31:06.821
It's like a puzzle
that's missing one huge piece.

31:06.908 --> 31:07.822
And without it, I'm--

31:11.173 --> 31:14.220
That's my reminder
to go set up for my party.

31:14.307 --> 31:17.179
I should probably call
everyone and cancel.

31:17.266 --> 31:18.398
Hey.

31:20.966 --> 31:24.708
Look, Reggie, if tonight is
your last night on Earth--

31:24.795 --> 31:28.364
if...

31:28.451 --> 31:30.192
then you should probably
say goodbye to your friends.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.379
Pizza and cookies?

31:43.466 --> 31:45.381
These are a few
of my favorite foods.

31:47.688 --> 31:49.995
Nice.

32:10.711 --> 32:11.755
You like pizza?

32:14.976 --> 32:16.935
We've got a metric ton of it.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.419
She'll be here.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.465
- You don't know that.
- Sure I do.

32:25.552 --> 32:26.901
She said she had to stop off
and get something

32:26.988 --> 32:28.381
from home first.

32:33.429 --> 32:34.517
Told you.

32:35.692 --> 32:36.693
You came.

32:36.780 --> 32:37.956
Hey, I love a party.

32:40.436 --> 32:43.048
- What's in the bag?
- Something

32:43.135 --> 32:47.139
I've been saving
for a special occasion.

33:11.032 --> 33:12.555
I'm really gonna miss this.

33:21.651 --> 33:23.262
Claire, we need to talk.

33:23.349 --> 33:24.741
That's what my mom says
when I'm in trouble.

33:24.828 --> 33:26.308
You're not in trouble.

33:26.395 --> 33:27.570
Not any more
than usual, anyway.

33:27.657 --> 33:28.876
Very funny.

33:30.834 --> 33:34.360
It looks like I'm gonna
be gone for a while, okay?

33:34.447 --> 33:36.666
But I want you to know

33:36.753 --> 33:40.279
that whatever happens,
you won't be alone.

33:40.366 --> 33:41.932
That's ominous.
Why is that so ominous?

33:42.020 --> 33:43.499
You'd think
my middle name is ominous,

33:43.586 --> 33:45.327
but my middle name is Cynthia.

33:45.414 --> 33:47.982
- Nikki.
- Sorry I'm late.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.158
Nikki's gonna be here to
protect you when you need her.

33:50.245 --> 33:52.030
She's like a fairy godmother
with a chainsaw.

34:00.734 --> 34:03.128
Oh, look,

34:03.215 --> 34:06.522
she's still here
in all her former glory.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.350
What is it, bottom feeders?

34:08.437 --> 34:10.657
Is that tone
really necessary?

34:10.744 --> 34:12.528
We're here
on official business.

34:12.615 --> 34:15.140
Logan the Impermeable has
requested your attendance

34:15.227 --> 34:16.489
at tomorrow's Assessment.

34:16.576 --> 34:18.491
He has?

34:18.578 --> 34:19.970
As a lowly page.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.363
What?

34:23.104 --> 34:27.369
I am not some lackey
to be given menial tasks.

34:27.456 --> 34:28.762
That's your job.

34:28.849 --> 34:31.243
Ah, but you are.

34:31.330 --> 34:34.550
And here's the paperwork
to prove it.

34:46.258 --> 34:48.912
Reginald, what is this?

34:48.999 --> 34:51.132
Uh, double pepperoni.

34:51.219 --> 34:53.917
This party.
Why are we all here?

34:54.004 --> 34:56.224
Oh.
Can't a guy just

34:56.311 --> 35:00.228
see his favorite people
in one place at the same time?

35:00.315 --> 35:02.187
There's something
that you're not telling me.

35:03.623 --> 35:06.191
Tell me, Reginald.

35:06.278 --> 35:11.152
Look, I don't want
to lie to you,

35:11.239 --> 35:12.936
so--

35:32.086 --> 35:33.827
I haven't seen you
in a while.

35:33.914 --> 35:35.611
I took a vacation,

35:35.698 --> 35:36.917
cracked a few skulls.

35:37.004 --> 35:39.528
You know, me time.

35:39.615 --> 35:40.964
But of course,
when Reginald invited me,

35:41.051 --> 35:42.401
I knew I had to come back,

35:42.488 --> 35:44.359
but not for Reginald,
for Claire.

35:44.446 --> 35:45.926
And not just for Claire,

35:46.013 --> 35:47.928
though more for Claire
than for Reginald.

35:48.015 --> 35:49.147
Though not just
for Claire, either.

35:49.234 --> 35:50.235
Is this a riddle?

35:56.589 --> 35:58.808
A negative, my favorite.

36:01.681 --> 36:03.683
Did you just
smell my blood type?

36:08.949 --> 36:11.125
You're a vampire.

36:11.212 --> 36:13.345
That doesn't scare you?

36:13.432 --> 36:15.129
Everything about you
scares me.

36:17.349 --> 36:19.177
Welcome to my world.

36:19.264 --> 36:20.439
I think you're gonna
love it here.

36:25.487 --> 36:27.576
Could I get everyone's
attention, please?

36:35.671 --> 36:38.587
For the last few months,
I have been a bad friend

36:38.674 --> 36:40.894
and boyfriend

36:40.981 --> 36:42.722
and employee,

36:42.809 --> 36:44.202
surrogate big brother,

36:44.289 --> 36:46.987
and last but not least, vampire.

36:47.074 --> 36:49.207
I, uh, didn't think anyone
would want to see me anymore.

36:51.513 --> 36:54.037
But, uh, here you are.

36:55.778 --> 36:57.737
That's why I'm just very,
uh, thankful

36:57.824 --> 36:59.565
that you all are my friends.

37:01.349 --> 37:04.918
And whatever tomorrow brings,

37:05.005 --> 37:06.311
I'm glad we have tonight.

37:10.271 --> 37:12.621
Uh, I'm sorry, sir,
we're closed for a private--

37:14.232 --> 37:16.146
Holy shit, it's him.

37:17.844 --> 37:20.150
What are you--

37:20.238 --> 37:21.848
Do not make eye contact.

37:24.111 --> 37:26.156
Uh, what is happening here?

37:26.244 --> 37:27.636
It's him.

37:27.723 --> 37:29.421
I--it's--it's
Logan the Reanimator,

37:29.508 --> 37:32.119
the--the Deacon of the Vampire
Councils of America.

37:32.206 --> 37:33.468
His reputation precedes him.

37:36.166 --> 37:37.342
You must be Roger.

37:37.429 --> 37:39.735
It's Reginald, actually.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.346
If you say so.

37:42.825 --> 37:45.393
I thought you'd be fatter.

37:47.569 --> 37:49.310
Thanks.

37:49.397 --> 37:51.617
Sarah, maybe you should
join the others.

37:51.704 --> 37:53.706
I kneel for no one.

37:53.793 --> 37:54.837
- And why is that?
- Whoa, whoa.

37:54.924 --> 37:56.230
You're not here for her.

37:56.317 --> 37:58.798
How delightful.

37:58.885 --> 38:00.843
I was hoping
for a demonstration.

38:00.930 --> 38:02.454
What?

38:02.541 --> 38:04.499
You glamour other vampires,
don't you?

38:04.586 --> 38:06.675
Care to have a go?

38:06.762 --> 38:08.982
Don't look at him.

38:09.069 --> 38:11.463
This is a conversation
between you and me.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.465
I don't
glamour people anymore.

38:13.552 --> 38:16.729
Luckily, I haven't been
a person for a very long time.

38:20.080 --> 38:23.736
Listen to me, you're gonna
leave me and my friends alone.

38:23.823 --> 38:26.216
As you command.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.957
You're gonna go back
to wherever you came from

38:28.044 --> 38:30.699
and never come to Akron again.

38:30.786 --> 38:32.527
As you command.

38:32.614 --> 38:34.050
Is that all?

38:35.965 --> 38:38.054
No, it--it's not.

38:38.141 --> 38:39.665
You're gonna decide
that I don't have to take

38:39.752 --> 38:41.319
the Assessment
and that henceforth,

38:41.406 --> 38:43.408
I am considered
a fully-fledged--

38:43.495 --> 38:45.584
A fully-fledged what?

38:52.504 --> 38:55.985
Please, I'm far too old
for your parlor trick.

38:56.072 --> 38:58.640
As for the Assessment,

38:58.727 --> 39:00.642
it will go precisely
as planned.

39:00.729 --> 39:02.427
You will take the tests.

39:02.514 --> 39:03.863
You will fail.

39:03.950 --> 39:06.474
You and your sire will
be executed.

39:06.561 --> 39:09.042
And when it's all over,

39:09.129 --> 39:10.348
I'll forget your name.

39:17.790 --> 39:19.922
What the hell was
that all about?

39:24.057 --> 39:26.668
- What an asshole.
- Yeah, he's...

39:26.755 --> 39:28.191
What's that guy's deal?

39:28.278 --> 39:30.063
That's Logan the, uh...

39:30.150 --> 39:32.021
- Yeah.
- Duplicitous...

39:32.108 --> 39:34.894
- Poor Reginald.
- Dipshit, Devious...

39:38.506 --> 39:40.378
Well, no, the Deacon
of all the vampires...

39:42.641 --> 39:44.991
Hey.

39:45.078 --> 39:47.080
Is Reginald okay?

39:49.865 --> 39:51.389
You're gonna die.

39:51.476 --> 39:53.391
That's what this party
is about, isn't it?

39:53.478 --> 39:56.350
Some sort of,
like, living wake.

39:58.439 --> 40:00.876
I mean, I just got used
to you being a vampire.

40:00.963 --> 40:03.096
I'm not sure that I'm ready
for you to die.

40:03.183 --> 40:05.141
Everything's okay,
I promise you.

40:05.228 --> 40:07.709
I got them right
where I want them, right?

40:07.796 --> 40:11.844
The last ace up my kind
of shortish sleeve.

40:11.931 --> 40:13.149
You're lying.

40:13.236 --> 40:15.021
I'm not.

40:15.108 --> 40:16.718
Don't tell me
you're not, Reginald.

40:16.805 --> 40:19.634
Despite everything,

40:19.721 --> 40:21.419
I still know you.

40:22.681 --> 40:24.291
I'm so scared.

40:27.729 --> 40:30.036
In less than 24 hours,

40:30.123 --> 40:34.214
no matter how hard I try
or plan,

40:34.301 --> 40:36.172
no matter how much
I want to live

40:36.259 --> 40:39.349
or--or how much I have
to live for,

40:39.437 --> 40:42.788
there's a distinct possibility
that I'm gonna be gone,

40:42.875 --> 40:44.920
absent from all of this.

40:46.182 --> 40:50.665
I want to be brave,
but I don't think I can be.

40:50.752 --> 40:53.059
How can I help?

40:53.146 --> 40:55.322
You can't.

40:55.409 --> 41:01.023
The vampire world is run by
a group of exclusive assholes.

41:01.110 --> 41:03.548
Someone like me
never had a chance.

41:03.635 --> 41:06.638
So it's just like
the real world then?

41:06.725 --> 41:08.640
I can work with that.
- You can't.

41:08.727 --> 41:10.119
The game is rigged.

41:10.206 --> 41:11.947
Then don't play their game.

41:13.645 --> 41:16.343
Reg, you got
to make me a vampire.

41:16.430 --> 41:17.605
And I will not take
no for an answer.

41:17.692 --> 41:19.085
- No.
- Oh, come on.

41:19.172 --> 41:20.869
I'd be perfect at it.

41:20.956 --> 41:22.958
I'll blend right in.
I could be your secret weapon.

41:23.045 --> 41:24.873
- For what?
- You know, for whatever

41:24.960 --> 41:27.093
Thunderdome Assessment shit
that suit was talking about.

41:27.180 --> 41:28.834
I'll dress up as a janitor.

41:28.921 --> 41:30.575
No one will suspect me.

41:30.662 --> 41:33.012
So when you're all like,
"Oh, no, tests are so hard,"

41:33.099 --> 41:34.579
that's when I'll
surprise everyone.

41:34.666 --> 41:37.582
It is I, Todd the Vampire,
to the rescue.

41:39.148 --> 41:40.628
And everyone will
come at me, right?

41:40.715 --> 41:42.412
But that's okay, because
I got my janitor broom,

41:42.500 --> 41:44.371
and I'll break it
right across my quad.

41:44.458 --> 41:46.329
Oh, look who's got a stake now.

41:46.416 --> 41:47.635
And that's when I'll say,

41:47.722 --> 41:49.898
"It's time
to take out the trash."

41:52.945 --> 41:54.903
'Cause I'm the janitor?
- Oh, got it.

41:54.990 --> 41:57.776
So then me and Mr. Pointy
will go all, like, kah-dusto.

41:57.863 --> 42:01.954
Whoo!

42:02.041 --> 42:05.218
Yah! Hoo!
Yeah, baby!

42:05.305 --> 42:07.873
All the vampires will be dead,
and Maurice will be safe.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.004
Don't you mean Reginald?

42:09.091 --> 42:11.746
Yeah, sure, Reginald too.

42:11.833 --> 42:14.009
Todd the Vampire
to the rescue.

42:14.096 --> 42:16.490
Everybody needs
a catchphrase.

42:16.577 --> 42:20.320
You know, I think you're
onto something, Todd.

42:20.407 --> 42:21.800
Wait, what?

42:21.887 --> 42:23.062
I'll grant your wish.

42:24.933 --> 42:26.500
I'll turn you into a vampire.

42:26.587 --> 42:28.458
- You will?
- Yes.

42:28.546 --> 42:29.547
Him?

42:30.722 --> 42:31.723
Hey!

42:31.810 --> 42:33.507
Hey. Where are you going?

42:33.594 --> 42:35.161
I got a date
with the final puzzle piece.

42:35.248 --> 42:37.642
You found the missing piece?

42:37.729 --> 42:39.861
Where?
Hey, wh--what is it, Reggie?

42:39.948 --> 42:42.472
Don't worry, I got this.
