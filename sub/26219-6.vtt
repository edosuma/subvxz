- Uh, me and Alex
[bleep] got into it.

21:41.433 --> 21:46.638
I missed his dad's surgery,
so--like he came to my house

21:46.705 --> 21:48.373
and end up storming out
and leaving.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.375
And I really haven't
heard from him since then.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.244
Like on top of all the [bleep]
that's going on

21:52.310 --> 21:54.813
with me and Alex,
guess who messaged me.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.281
- SKY: Who?
- KITTY: Who?

21:56.348 --> 21:57.916
- Moe.
- What?

21:57.983 --> 21:59.918
- Shut up.
- SKY: What did he say?

21:59.985 --> 22:02.020
- DONNA: Surprisingly,
he was actually cordial,

22:02.087 --> 22:03.655
and all he said he wanted to do

22:03.722 --> 22:05.123
was come get his stuff
from my apartment.

22:05.190 --> 22:08.160
And he talking about he wanna
meet up and have a conversation.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.098
- Yo, this is a bad idea
if I've ever heard one.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.634
{\an8}Donna ex-boyfriend Moe
totally made a scene

22:15.701 --> 22:16.968
{\an8}on our trip to Miami.

22:17.035 --> 22:18.570
- You got community [bleep].

22:18.637 --> 22:19.638
You're dirty.

22:19.705 --> 22:21.073
You [bleep] in bathrooms.

22:21.139 --> 22:23.709
And your [bleep] is everybody's!

22:23.775 --> 22:25.610
- I mean, sure,
she cheated on him with Alex

22:25.677 --> 22:26.845
in a bathroom stall.

22:26.912 --> 22:28.747
But that still doesn't warrant
Moe's behavior.

22:28.814 --> 22:31.083
So if I were Donna, I would
definitely be getting

22:31.149 --> 22:33.785
a restraining order and not
making a date for chitchat.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.654
- SKY: Wait, do you
wanna meet up with him?

22:35.721 --> 22:37.289
Like do you wanna
see him for real?

22:37.355 --> 22:40.025
- The sensible part of me feels
like I should definitely just

22:40.092 --> 22:42.394
scratch this meeting out of
my mind and ignore the message.

22:42.461 --> 22:46.665
But then...a part of me
wants to have a conversation

22:46.732 --> 22:49.601
and like give him
his [bleep] back.

22:49.668 --> 22:51.336
So I don't know.

22:51.403 --> 22:53.872
{\an8}Things ended up in a really
[bleep] way between me and Moe.

22:53.939 --> 22:55.974
And I'm just trying
to move on with my life.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.776
So in a way,
by having this conversation,

22:57.843 --> 22:59.878
I think it'll bring us
both closure.

22:59.945 --> 23:01.947
All I know is I need a stiff
drink right now.

23:02.013 --> 23:04.049

Jadah's gonna be here soon.

23:05.350 --> 23:07.619

How--you invited Jadah?

23:07.686 --> 23:08.887

23:08.954 --> 23:10.655
- KITTY: I don't know how
that's gonna go down?

23:10.722 --> 23:11.857
- DONNA: Why?

23:11.923 --> 23:13.658
- You know Bae hired
a new receptionist?

23:13.725 --> 23:14.893
- What?

23:14.960 --> 23:16.294

Cease just hired her.
