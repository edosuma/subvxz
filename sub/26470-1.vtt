02:10.125 --> 02:11.083
Nice to see you.

02:14.708 --> 02:15.666
Come on!

02:16.958 --> 02:18.833
-Hey, Monica!
-Viljar!

02:23.166 --> 02:24.083
Thank you.

02:27.291 --> 02:28.125
Hi.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.750
-Viljar Hanssen?
-Alex?

03:35.708 --> 03:36.541
Viljar!

03:37.000 --> 03:38.250
-Hey.
-Hey!

03:38.333 --> 03:40.666
-We saved a spot for you.
-Perfect.

03:41.166 --> 03:43.125
-Good to see you, man.
-Good to see you.

03:44.875 --> 03:46.000
The crew is gathered.

03:46.083 --> 03:47.583
Long time.

03:47.666 --> 03:49.333
-Hey, how are you doing?
-All right.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.208
You actually brought a sleeping bag
this time?

03:54.291 --> 03:56.291
Yeah, my parents packed.

03:57.250 --> 04:00.041
Hey, this is painful to look at.

04:31.625 --> 04:35.416
So, on Saturday you'll be going
to the AUF summer camp at Utøya.

04:35.750 --> 04:39.416
Here's the schedule, and attached
is also a draft of your speech.

04:39.500 --> 04:43.250
I started with your connection to
the island, how it inspired your activism,

04:43.791 --> 04:46.250
and then you kind of push on
to the issues.

04:46.666 --> 04:48.833
Good. I think it needs to be
a bit more personal,

04:48.916 --> 04:51.000
more about my memories from the island.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.416
And then I want to address
the challenge of youth unemployment.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.833
-I think that's very important.
-Yeah, that's good.

04:56.916 --> 04:59.458
Make sure we build in proper time
to really meet with the kids.

04:59.541 --> 05:00.375
OK.

05:00.875 --> 05:01.875
Two hours, maybe?

05:02.083 --> 05:04.375
And the committee papers
are in the briefcase.

05:04.458 --> 05:06.458
You should read those before Monday.

05:06.541 --> 05:09.416
Got it. Well, I think we're all set.
Thank you.

05:09.791 --> 05:11.000
-Get some rest.
-You too.

05:11.083 --> 05:12.083
You too, sir.

05:12.750 --> 05:13.916
-Thank you.
-Night.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.166
And tomorrow morning you have
the national security briefing at 10:00,

05:17.250 --> 05:18.083
for an hour.

05:18.166 --> 05:19.791
-I'll do it in the residency.
-OK.

05:19.875 --> 05:21.958
And bring the Justice Minister in earlier.

05:22.041 --> 05:23.666
-Yes, of course.
-Have a good night.

05:23.750 --> 05:25.625
-Good luck with the speech, sir.
-Thank you.

05:27.041 --> 05:28.041
Good night, sir.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.000
See you back here after lunch.

07:19.291 --> 07:20.291
Anders?

08:01.291 --> 08:02.791
Good morning. Welcome.

08:03.708 --> 08:05.583
-Nice to see you! Hi!
-Hey, you.

08:06.583 --> 08:07.791
Just come on in.

08:08.458 --> 08:09.958
There's seats for everyone.

08:13.083 --> 08:15.083
-This OK?
-Yeah, fine.

08:18.208 --> 08:20.083
OK. Welcome, everyone.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.333
So, welcome to the first seminar
for today.

08:25.916 --> 08:27.750
We are going to do an exercise,

08:27.916 --> 08:30.541
which I'll call
"If I Were Prime Minister."

08:31.750 --> 08:34.500
One of the good things about Utøya
is that you can meet friends

08:34.583 --> 08:37.750
and you can play music,
and maybe stay up a bit late.

08:38.291 --> 08:39.166
Yeah?

08:39.833 --> 08:44.041
But it's also an opportunity
to think about your future.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.916
You grow up so fast,
then one day it will be you

08:47.000 --> 08:49.333
that will be the leader
of your community.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.500
Viljar, can you start?

08:51.666 --> 08:53.125
Yeah, sure.

09:03.208 --> 09:04.291
Hi.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.458
How are you?

09:06.958 --> 09:08.291
So, let's see.

09:10.291 --> 09:11.125
OK.

09:13.333 --> 09:16.583
So, in Svalbard, where I come from,

09:18.375 --> 09:21.750
everyone is welcome,
regardless of nationality.

09:22.541 --> 09:24.625
We've got Norwegians,

09:25.083 --> 09:26.416
Russians,

09:26.958 --> 09:29.291
Chinese, Croatians,

09:30.333 --> 09:32.458
all living and working together.

09:32.541 --> 09:36.416
And we worked really hard
to integrate everyone.

09:36.541 --> 09:39.875
But in Svalbard, it's, like, 2,000 people.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.500
How do you translate that
to the rest of Europe?

09:44.125 --> 09:47.000
It's the principle,
and that's what's important.

09:48.583 --> 09:52.833
And if I was Prime Minister,
that's what I'd stand for.

10:27.666 --> 10:31.541
...groundwater reserves are drying up.
Sustained drought is becoming the norm...

11:47.958 --> 11:51.625
We got a white van parked out back.
Is it one of ours?

12:47.750 --> 12:51.125
OK. I'll just check the license plate
and try to find the driver.

12:59.791 --> 13:02.416
Central, will you check
a serial number for me, please?

13:26.083 --> 13:28.291
Get him out of here! Come on! Move!

13:48.791 --> 13:50.166
Prime Minister secure.

14:08.375 --> 14:09.416
We need help.

14:17.625 --> 14:20.416
We have breaking news
coming out of Oslo right now.

14:20.541 --> 14:23.333
A large explosion has gone off
in the center of the city,

14:23.791 --> 14:26.750
I think, the government district,
near the Prime Minister's office.

14:26.875 --> 14:27.791
We have no further...

14:33.291 --> 14:35.333
It isn't safe. Everybody out!

14:45.500 --> 14:46.333
Call the cabinet.

14:46.416 --> 14:49.000
I want the police director,
head of defense, and the PST.

14:49.750 --> 14:50.833
Inform the King:

14:51.500 --> 14:54.541
The Prime Minister is safe.
The government is functioning.

14:55.666 --> 14:58.291
There is a lot of debris
and smoke, but...

14:58.791 --> 15:01.625
I can clearly see a car that was flipped
onto its roof,

15:01.708 --> 15:04.500
and I'm assuming it's a result
of the blast itself.

15:06.250 --> 15:07.375
As you probably heard,

15:07.458 --> 15:10.041
there's been an explosion
in the government district in Oslo.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.666
Yeah. We don't have much information yet.

15:15.125 --> 15:17.500
Many of you have parents
who work there, OK?

15:17.583 --> 15:20.583
So you should probably call them,
if you haven't done that already.

15:21.166 --> 15:25.125
In the meantime, we'll suspend activities
until we get some more information.

15:25.208 --> 15:28.000
But for now,
you go and call your parents, OK?

15:28.958 --> 15:30.291
Any more questions?

15:32.750 --> 15:35.166
The Prime Minister?
Do you know if he's OK?

15:36.333 --> 15:37.875
-Hey, Mom?
-Hi, Viljar.

15:38.041 --> 15:39.000
Are you OK?

15:39.291 --> 15:42.333
Yeah, I'm fine. Your dad's with me.
We're at the hotel, we're fine.

15:43.041 --> 15:44.750
They say it was an explosion.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.291
Dad says there's been
some kind of explosion.

15:47.375 --> 15:49.291
-Was it a bomb?
-Yeah, we don't know.

15:50.333 --> 15:51.708
Are you both OK?

15:52.166 --> 15:54.666
Yeah, we're fine.
Torje's a bit scared, but...

15:55.125 --> 15:56.916
I'll take care of him. Yeah, I promise.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.208
We'll call you when we know
what's happened, OK?

15:59.291 --> 16:00.166
Bye.

16:01.041 --> 16:03.708
She's fine.
She said they were nowhere near.

16:03.833 --> 16:06.125
Come. Let's go. I need to change.

16:09.041 --> 16:11.041
Velna, are you OK? What's happened?

16:11.166 --> 16:13.125
Have you talked to Eric and the others?

16:13.791 --> 16:16.125
OK, cancel all the campaign meetings.

16:16.250 --> 16:19.166
Call me when you...
when you hear anything, OK?

16:19.958 --> 16:21.791
So, here's what we know so far.

16:21.875 --> 16:23.458
At around 3:30,

16:23.541 --> 16:27.166
a massive explosion was reported
in the center of the government district.

16:27.250 --> 16:30.125
Witnesses have described
extensive destruction

16:30.250 --> 16:31.750
hitting a number of buildings.

16:32.125 --> 16:35.125
There are many confirmed injured
and unfortunately also...

16:35.208 --> 16:39.625
You can see shattered windows
up to 300 yards in each...

16:39.708 --> 16:41.041
Like many countries in Europe,

16:41.125 --> 16:43.916
the Security Services have already
been operating on high alert.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.166
Counterterrorism police in Oslo have made
a number of arrests in recent months.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.541
-Hi.
-Hi.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.375
I'm Martin Nilsen, from Oslo PD.

17:07.458 --> 17:09.958
-You heard about the bomb in the city?
-Yes.

17:10.041 --> 17:11.875
I've been sent to secure the island.

17:12.416 --> 17:15.000
-Where's the ferry?
-Oh, the ferry got canceled.

17:15.791 --> 17:18.333
-Get it over here. I need it now.
-OK.

17:19.791 --> 17:21.416
-Monica?
-Go ahead.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.833
There's a policeman over here
that will need the ferry immediately.

17:25.708 --> 17:27.791
-Yeah, I will be there. OK.
-Thank you.

17:28.791 --> 17:31.291
-It will be here soon.
-OK, good.

17:41.666 --> 17:44.125
-Be there in a minute.
-It's on its way.

18:07.416 --> 18:08.250
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:08.958 --> 18:10.625
I'm Monica. I'm in charge here.

18:10.916 --> 18:12.916
Hi. Martin Nilsen, Oslo Police Department.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.041
Nice to meet you.

18:14.625 --> 18:16.875
-You heard about the explosion in Oslo?
-Yeah.

18:17.041 --> 18:19.041
-It's terrible. Is it bad?
-Yeah.

18:19.708 --> 18:22.375
The whole Prime Minister's office,
everything.

18:23.041 --> 18:25.125
-I need you to take me to the island.
-Yeah.

18:25.208 --> 18:28.500
Get everyone together, and I'll give
a debrief about the bomb.

18:28.583 --> 18:31.041
-Everyone?
-Yeah, everyone. It's important.

18:32.125 --> 18:33.416
What's in the cases?

18:33.625 --> 18:34.583
Weapons.

18:35.250 --> 18:38.000
Well, you have to cover them up.
They will scare the children.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.000
Sure.

18:40.291 --> 18:41.333
Just go ahead.

18:57.166 --> 18:59.666
-What's going on?
-Don't worry. Police have arrived.

18:59.750 --> 19:01.083
So, it's fine.

19:17.291 --> 19:18.125
Simon?

19:18.750 --> 19:20.083
-Yeah?
-Do you have my sweater?

19:22.125 --> 19:23.208
Any news on the bomb?

19:24.041 --> 19:26.250
-Here you go.
-It hit the Prime Minister's office.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.583
Yeah. And the Department of Justice.

19:28.666 --> 19:29.833
Was it Al-Qaeda?

19:30.416 --> 19:31.583
It doesn't say.

19:38.125 --> 19:38.958
Hey.

19:39.708 --> 19:40.541
Hi.

19:41.166 --> 19:43.375
This is Trond Berntsen,
our head of security.

19:43.458 --> 19:44.875
-Hi.
-Martin Nilsen, Oslo PD.

19:44.958 --> 19:47.791
They only sent one officer?
Why didn't anybody call?

19:48.041 --> 19:50.125
Everyone is needed in Oslo, it's chaos.

19:50.208 --> 19:52.125
So, they sent me to secure the island.

19:53.750 --> 19:57.291
-What precinct are you from?
-PST, Police Security Service.

19:57.625 --> 20:00.291
So you must know Jørn.
He works down at PST, doesn't he?

20:00.875 --> 20:03.416
Jørn? Yeah, sure.
He's one of my superiors.

20:04.125 --> 20:07.666
-Is everyone gathered for the debrief?
-Yes. We're calling them in now.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.666
We need to get on with this.

20:11.333 --> 20:14.083
Actually, can I see your ID?

20:15.333 --> 20:16.333
Yeah, sure.

20:20.083 --> 20:22.083
We're ready to gather in the cabin.

20:27.958 --> 20:28.791
What was that?

20:33.541 --> 20:35.250
Maybe you should go and check it out.

20:36.333 --> 20:37.750
-Use your radio.
-I will.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.250
It's probably nothing.

21:03.833 --> 21:05.500
Run! Get away!

21:06.333 --> 21:07.708
Run! Run!

21:07.916 --> 21:09.125
Over here! Come on!

21:15.166 --> 21:16.750
Run, run, Torje! Run!

21:22.333 --> 21:23.166
This way!

21:24.541 --> 21:25.416
Run, Torje!

21:25.916 --> 21:27.875
-Torje, move!
-Viljar!

21:32.375 --> 21:34.041
Simon! Simon, come!

21:40.458 --> 21:42.041
It's OK. Police.

21:43.708 --> 21:45.083
Stay away from the windows.

21:45.208 --> 21:47.666
Get down on the floor,
and I'll come inside. OK?

21:47.750 --> 21:48.958
Get down!

21:54.125 --> 21:55.291
This way!

22:09.041 --> 22:10.458
You will die today.

22:10.583 --> 22:13.708
Marxists, liberals, members of the elite.

22:16.875 --> 22:18.500
-Move!
-Quick! Down here!

22:19.333 --> 22:20.541
Down, hide here.

22:20.916 --> 22:23.125
-Down. Stay down.
-Get down.

22:24.208 --> 22:26.416
Viljar! Viljar, come on, over here!

22:27.666 --> 22:29.416
-Over here.
-The cliffs!

22:29.791 --> 22:32.166
Hang on. Simon, Simon! This way.

22:33.416 --> 22:35.041
-Come on, go!
-Run!

22:40.583 --> 22:42.458
Come on! We can make it.

22:48.291 --> 22:49.666
Come. Get down there.

22:50.250 --> 22:51.708
-Come on!
-Get down. Come.

22:53.375 --> 22:54.375
Get down.

23:07.750 --> 23:08.625
Help!

23:18.458 --> 23:22.166
-Was it a bomb?
-We don't know. Please move back.

23:22.250 --> 23:24.500
Can you please tell me
which buildings have been hit?

23:24.583 --> 23:26.958
We don't know. We just need you
to move back, please.

23:27.375 --> 23:30.166
-Come on, we're clearing the area.
-Is anyone being evacuated?

23:31.125 --> 23:32.541
-Mom.
-Viljar?

23:32.791 --> 23:34.458
-They're shooting at us.
-Viljar?

23:34.666 --> 23:35.666
Keep moving.

23:36.291 --> 23:37.125
What--

23:40.333 --> 23:42.833
I lost Viljar.
He said someone was shooting at them.

23:42.916 --> 23:44.666
-At them? Where?
-And he hung up.

23:47.541 --> 23:50.083
But he said--
What what did he say exactly?

23:50.166 --> 23:52.166
He said, "Mom, someone's shooting at us."

23:52.250 --> 23:54.375
It went really quickly.
It was just like that.

23:54.458 --> 23:55.500
-"Shooting at us"?
-Yes.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.291
It's going to voice mail.

24:08.541 --> 24:11.125
Multiple reports of gunfire
on Utøya Island.

24:11.250 --> 24:15.291
Copy that. This is O-5. We are responding.
What's the RV? Over.

24:15.958 --> 24:18.250
-Repeat, please.
-What's the RV?

24:18.666 --> 24:20.666
RV for Utøya Island, over.

24:21.458 --> 24:22.291
Stand by.

24:22.791 --> 24:23.875
Come on, come on!

24:29.750 --> 24:32.291
Sir, we may have another attack.

24:33.083 --> 24:34.833
Report of gunfire on Utøya.

24:35.916 --> 24:37.541
-What?
-No, I haven't.

24:37.625 --> 24:40.166
-The summer camp?
-Just getting details now.

24:40.708 --> 24:43.458
-What more do we know?
-We have hundreds of kids there.

24:43.541 --> 24:44.666
Any details.

24:50.291 --> 24:51.291
Where are you?

24:52.250 --> 24:53.583
Come out, you Marxists.

24:57.958 --> 25:00.666
He's coming for us. He's-- He's coming.

25:01.875 --> 25:05.041
Torje, look at me. It's going to be OK.

25:06.625 --> 25:07.541
I promise you.

25:12.250 --> 25:13.333
It'll be all right.

25:20.958 --> 25:23.291
-Get that started now!
-Get the engine started!

25:23.375 --> 25:24.750
Pull that engine!

25:24.833 --> 25:26.083
Come on!

25:27.291 --> 25:30.541
Delta Two, you take the north side.
We take the west side.

25:30.625 --> 25:32.250
-Got it? Move!
-Got it.

25:35.125 --> 25:36.416
Go, go, go.

25:41.541 --> 25:43.625
-I need an update on Delta.
-No, no.

25:44.041 --> 25:45.875
You just get them in there. I mean--

25:45.958 --> 25:47.541
This is taking too long, right?

25:47.666 --> 25:49.250
Because there is no helicopter.

25:49.625 --> 25:51.291
No, there is no helicopter at all.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.291
We just need them to be on standby...

25:53.416 --> 25:56.416
Are they on the island yet?
Where the hell are they?

25:57.708 --> 26:01.583
-...a summer camp on the island...
-Viljar, when you get this, call us.

26:01.666 --> 26:04.750
...getting confirmed reports
that there is another attack...

26:04.916 --> 26:06.250
-Nothing?
-...ongoing.

26:06.333 --> 26:09.958
This now looks like a coordinated
gun and bomb attack

26:10.041 --> 26:13.041
-on Oslo City Center and Utøya Island.
-Oh, no.

26:13.541 --> 26:15.875
I'm afraid we have no further details yet,

26:15.958 --> 26:19.166
but it looks very much
like this is by no means...

26:21.666 --> 26:22.500
Hey!

26:26.083 --> 26:27.083
It's all right.

26:31.125 --> 26:33.250
He's coming. Get down. Down.

26:35.208 --> 26:37.625
Help me! Please!

26:40.750 --> 26:42.916
Help! Somebody help!

26:49.333 --> 26:51.250
Play dead. Play dead.

27:38.333 --> 27:39.250
I can hear him.

27:40.708 --> 27:41.541
Where is he?

28:01.750 --> 28:03.833
We have to jump! Jump!

28:30.666 --> 28:32.666
Viljar! Viljar!

28:34.708 --> 28:35.708
Viljar!

28:36.166 --> 28:37.208
Viljar!

28:37.750 --> 28:39.625
-Go.
-No, no!

28:39.708 --> 28:40.666
-Viljar.
-Go.

28:43.333 --> 28:44.291
Go!

28:45.250 --> 28:46.500
You have to come with me!

28:48.875 --> 28:49.750
Viljar!

28:50.375 --> 28:51.750
-Go!
-No!

28:51.916 --> 28:52.791
Go!

28:54.666 --> 28:55.583
Go!

29:27.958 --> 29:28.791
Simon!

29:31.708 --> 29:32.750
Anders!

29:54.125 --> 29:55.500
Move, move!

29:56.416 --> 29:57.250
Shield!

29:59.583 --> 30:00.791
Move, move.

30:00.875 --> 30:01.750
-Go, go.
-Get down.

30:01.833 --> 30:03.625
Get down! Get down!

30:04.125 --> 30:06.916
Get down. Down, down. Stay hidden!

30:17.291 --> 30:18.291
It's a roadblock.

30:24.500 --> 30:27.166
-Please, you can't go down there.
-No! You don't understand.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.416
-We can hear the shoot--
-The police are--

30:32.916 --> 30:35.750
I need to get down there.
Our children are on the island!

30:35.833 --> 30:37.916
I understand, but it's too dangerous.

30:38.166 --> 30:39.583
Move farther back, please.

31:09.041 --> 31:11.583
Arms out to the side! Come forward!

31:12.250 --> 31:13.375
Come forward! Stop!

31:13.875 --> 31:15.125
Down on your knees!

31:15.833 --> 31:18.041
On your stomach! Go, go!

31:18.541 --> 31:20.083
Arms up! Cuff him!

31:20.458 --> 31:22.125
Look away. Look away from him.

31:26.958 --> 31:28.083
Down over there!

32:15.250 --> 32:18.416
On three. One, two, and three.

32:18.791 --> 32:21.250
We have a young male
with multiple gunshot wounds.

32:21.333 --> 32:23.625
No known history. Unconscious on arrival.

32:23.708 --> 32:25.375
Blood pressure's dropping. Sixty-thirty.

32:26.125 --> 32:27.625
We have to transfuse him.

32:27.791 --> 32:29.250
O-minus. Six units.

32:29.625 --> 32:33.125
There is an injury to his left shoulder.
It's a penetrating injury.

32:33.208 --> 32:34.833
We've got cardiac arrest.
We're losing him.

32:34.916 --> 32:36.416
Starting chest compressions.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.333
-We're losing him.
-Put the patch on.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.166
-Patch is on.
-150.

32:41.250 --> 32:44.166
-Charge, 150.
-150, repeat. Charging.

32:44.250 --> 32:45.291
OK, clear!

32:46.708 --> 32:48.875
-Still V-fib.
-Come on!

32:48.958 --> 32:50.958
-Thorax stable.
-We're getting a pulse.

32:51.041 --> 32:52.291
-I got a pulse.
-OK, good.

32:52.375 --> 32:54.791
Got pulse on the radial. Let's continue.

32:54.916 --> 32:57.625
There's a gunshot wound here
to his lower extremity on the right side.

32:57.708 --> 32:58.916
Could be arterial bleeding.

32:59.041 --> 33:01.166
And there's another here to his right arm.

33:01.250 --> 33:03.666
-We're losing him again.
-V-fib! Starting compressions again.

33:03.916 --> 33:06.250
-Go for 200.
-200, charging.

33:06.333 --> 33:07.333
OK, clear.

33:11.333 --> 33:13.500
Got sinus resp and a pulse.

33:13.916 --> 33:15.083
Got pulse on the radial.

33:15.166 --> 33:17.250
There is an entry wound here
to his right orbital.

33:18.333 --> 33:19.875
Exit wound here on the posterior.

33:20.208 --> 33:21.666
Blood pressure is stable.

33:21.750 --> 33:22.958
Eighty over forty.

33:23.166 --> 33:25.125
-Do we have the bleeding under control?
-Yes.

33:25.208 --> 33:27.875
-Hydrolin is in.
-OK, we have to go for surgery.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.416
All right, you can stand up.

34:02.791 --> 34:03.750
Open your mouth.

34:09.416 --> 34:12.875
I'm the duty detective, formally here
in the First Police District.

34:13.375 --> 34:16.333
-Who are you?
-My name is Anders Behring Breivik.

34:16.958 --> 34:19.500
This is a military operation,
a coup d'état.

34:20.250 --> 34:22.125
The bomb has removed the government,

34:22.208 --> 34:24.833
and here I have liquidated
a political camp.

34:25.625 --> 34:26.625
Did anyone help you?

34:27.208 --> 34:28.875
I was selected for this mission.

34:29.375 --> 34:33.541
Now my brothers are waiting for my signal
to begin the third attack.

34:33.625 --> 34:35.541
You're telling me
there's another attack planned.

34:35.625 --> 34:36.625
-Oh, yes.
-Where?

34:37.000 --> 34:40.500
I can't go into details,
but I'm authorized to negotiate.

34:41.916 --> 34:45.208
-What do you want?
-A complete ban on immigration.

34:45.958 --> 34:48.958
An end to enforced multiculturalism.

34:50.625 --> 34:54.791
And if the Prime Minister is still alive,
you should tell him if he fails to agree,

34:55.833 --> 34:57.375
the attacks will continue.

35:02.041 --> 35:04.916
Sir, Hønefoss Police
want to know what to do.

35:09.041 --> 35:11.833
-Keep him talking and bring him to Oslo.
-Understood.

35:39.416 --> 35:41.833
-Name?
-Anders Behring Breivik.

35:44.791 --> 35:46.250
-Arrested?
-Utøya.

35:49.416 --> 35:50.250
Lawyer?

35:50.333 --> 35:53.708
Yeah, there's a particular lawyer
that I would like to represent me.

35:53.958 --> 35:55.875
His name is Geir Lippestad.

35:59.041 --> 36:01.500
-Thanks so much, Anna, for staying.
-Of course.

36:03.458 --> 36:04.833
Do you need anything?

36:05.541 --> 36:09.458
No, thanks. Just keep the kids away
from the television.

36:11.208 --> 36:14.125
-Don't worry about that, OK?
-Thank you so much. Thank you.

36:17.500 --> 36:18.750
Hi, this is Lippestad.

36:21.583 --> 36:22.500
For me?

36:28.375 --> 36:29.250
Breivik?

36:32.000 --> 36:33.166
I never heard of him.

36:37.916 --> 36:39.000
I understand.

36:45.625 --> 36:46.541
What is it?

36:47.083 --> 36:48.458
The person they arrested.

36:49.916 --> 36:50.916
He asked for me.

36:52.791 --> 36:53.708
Why?

37:16.708 --> 37:18.208
He was right behind us.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.375
-Torje?
-Torje!

37:41.041 --> 37:41.958
It's OK.

37:43.208 --> 37:44.333
It's OK, Torje.

37:45.291 --> 37:46.291
It's OK.

37:48.625 --> 37:49.833
You're safe now.

37:50.458 --> 37:51.541
Where's Viljar?

37:52.666 --> 37:55.250
-You know where he is?
-We were on the cliffs, but...

37:55.583 --> 37:57.250
but he was shooting. We had to jump.

37:57.333 --> 37:58.791
Did Viljar jump?

38:02.750 --> 38:03.750
Was he shot?

38:07.583 --> 38:08.541
I'll go and check.

38:09.833 --> 38:10.916
Oh, my God.

38:16.958 --> 38:19.041
Can you check for Viljar Hanssen?

38:20.458 --> 38:21.666
Viljar Hanssen.

38:26.916 --> 38:28.208
Can you check, please?

38:28.791 --> 38:30.208
Viljar Hanssen.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.041
He's not here.

38:45.041 --> 38:45.916
He's not here.

38:46.625 --> 38:49.375
-What do you mean he's not here?
-He's not on any list.

38:50.125 --> 38:51.791
I'm calling the hospital now.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.458
Yes. Hello, I'm...

38:54.750 --> 38:58.166
I'm looking for my son,
Viljar Hanssen. He was on Utøya.

38:58.666 --> 39:01.375
Do you have any admissions by that name?

39:06.000 --> 39:07.916
OK. Thank you.

39:09.833 --> 39:10.708
No.

39:11.250 --> 39:12.666
He was on Utøya.

39:13.625 --> 39:16.208
Yes, do you have any admissions
by that name?

39:18.000 --> 39:19.083
OK. Thank you.

39:22.750 --> 39:24.791
Yes, hello. I'm looking for Viljar Han--

39:41.250 --> 39:42.333
Bone piece.

39:56.083 --> 39:57.291
-Hi.
-Sir.

40:28.041 --> 40:29.666
Please remove the restraints.

40:36.291 --> 40:38.666
Yes. Then just give us the room, please.

40:40.708 --> 40:42.750
Anders Behring Breivik. Nice to meet you.

40:43.166 --> 40:45.208
-Geir Lippestad.
-Thank you for coming.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.833
So, how do you know who...
who I am?

40:53.916 --> 40:55.541
I've seen your work before.

40:56.041 --> 40:57.125
Nine years ago.

40:57.500 --> 41:00.083
The Benjamin Hermansen neo-Nazi case.

41:01.958 --> 41:03.375
We met during the trial.

41:05.833 --> 41:07.291
-Did we?
-Yeah.

41:08.583 --> 41:10.666
I knew I would need a lawyer one day.

41:13.041 --> 41:14.416
Tell me, Mr. Breivik,

41:15.250 --> 41:16.541
what you've done today.

41:17.333 --> 41:18.708
I have started a war

41:19.208 --> 41:22.125
to take back control of Norway,
of the West.

41:22.708 --> 41:23.875
And defending me

41:24.750 --> 41:27.000
will be the greatest thing you'll ever do.

41:29.125 --> 41:31.500
Although it's my duty to take this case,

41:32.166 --> 41:34.875
I don't agree with what you've done today,
Mr. Breivik.

41:36.333 --> 41:37.500
They're innocent...

41:38.333 --> 41:39.166
children.

41:40.250 --> 41:41.708
They were traitors.

41:43.125 --> 41:44.666
Children of the elite.

41:45.541 --> 41:46.750
The leaders of tomorrow.

41:47.916 --> 41:49.875
My own children have been to Utøya.

41:50.583 --> 41:53.291
I'm an active member of the Labour Party.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.750
Does that make me a traitor, too?

41:59.333 --> 42:01.833
You are my lawyer. You're an exception.

42:10.666 --> 42:11.541
I'm so sorry.

42:29.833 --> 42:31.541
Anders and Simon are dead.

42:51.875 --> 42:52.708
Hello?

42:55.416 --> 42:56.250
Yes.

42:59.500 --> 43:02.416
He has a bad scar on his neck.
A fire burn.

43:07.416 --> 43:08.458
OK. Thank you.

43:09.458 --> 43:10.958
He's in the hospital.

43:11.500 --> 43:12.375
Let's go.

43:36.541 --> 43:38.750
Don't be afraid. I'm not operative.

43:58.250 --> 44:00.791
-Hello?
-Police. Open the door.

44:00.958 --> 44:01.791
Police?

44:07.083 --> 44:10.916
I'm Mina Anderson. I'm a detective
at the Homicide and Serious Crimes Unit.

44:12.041 --> 44:14.250
Do you understand
that you've been arrested in connection

44:14.333 --> 44:17.291
with the explosion in Oslo
and the shootings on Utøya Island?

44:17.500 --> 44:18.458
Yeah, of course.

44:26.041 --> 44:27.416
Did anyone help you with it?

44:28.333 --> 44:31.166
I'm just one cog in a network,
the Knights Templar,

44:31.791 --> 44:34.166
named in honor
of the Knights of the Crusade.

44:34.750 --> 44:36.583
We want Islam out of Europe.

44:37.833 --> 44:39.875
Can you give me any names?

44:41.083 --> 44:41.916
No.

44:42.666 --> 44:43.500
Of course not.

44:43.750 --> 44:46.041
-Clear.
-Go! Get this out of here!

44:46.833 --> 44:49.666
We have found your computer
at your mother's apartment.

44:49.750 --> 44:52.333
-Can you tell me what's on it?
-My manifesto.

44:53.500 --> 44:56.875
I sent it out so people
will understand what I've done.

44:59.041 --> 45:00.958
It's all there, 1,500 pages.

45:05.041 --> 45:07.291
We need to know if there are
more attacks planned.

45:07.375 --> 45:10.416
Yeah, this is a war.
Attacks can come at any moment.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.666
-But you need to agree to my demands.
-This is not a negotiation.

45:14.791 --> 45:17.208
I don't believe you're in a position
to dictate terms.

45:17.541 --> 45:19.041
Is another attack coming?

45:19.916 --> 45:20.916
Can we take a break?

45:21.000 --> 45:25.125
I've been trying to get medical attention
ever since I was arrested. I...

45:25.333 --> 45:28.208
cut it on a piece of someone's skull
when it shattered, and...

45:28.291 --> 45:31.541
this might be infected
if I don't get treatment.

45:31.625 --> 45:32.666
Yes.

45:33.416 --> 45:36.541
Can we pause the interview
whilst my client is

45:37.250 --> 45:38.500
seen by a medic?

45:44.708 --> 45:46.958
He could be bluffing, sir.
We just don't know.

45:56.125 --> 45:57.833
Tell him I'm listening to him.

45:59.750 --> 46:01.291
Tell him personally for me.

46:04.333 --> 46:05.916
I'm listening to him.

46:12.833 --> 46:13.833
Thank you.

46:21.875 --> 46:22.875
I'll tell him.

46:34.041 --> 46:36.250
The Prime Minister has seen your demands.

46:37.083 --> 46:38.458
He can't accept your terms.

46:39.291 --> 46:41.666
But he wanted me to give you a message.

46:42.833 --> 46:43.666
Really?

46:44.666 --> 46:45.500
He said that?

46:45.958 --> 46:48.416
It was a personal message
from the Prime Minister.

46:49.833 --> 46:53.083
He said he wants you to know
that he's listening to you.

46:55.833 --> 46:56.791
Is he in there?

46:57.750 --> 46:58.666
Watching us?

47:02.416 --> 47:05.166
We need to know
if there are any more attacks planned.

47:07.333 --> 47:10.833
Tell him I'm prepared
to call off the attacks, for the moment.

47:11.333 --> 47:13.208
How do we know that we can trust you?

47:15.791 --> 47:17.833
Because you're all listening to me now.

47:43.333 --> 47:45.125
OK. More of these, please.

47:45.208 --> 47:48.583
Have a seat right here, please.
The doctor will be with you shortly.

47:48.666 --> 47:50.333
-OK.
-OK.

47:51.333 --> 47:53.166
-Just sit and wait here?
-Yes.

47:53.458 --> 47:54.583
He'll be here soon.

48:17.083 --> 48:18.416
-Hi.
-Hi.

48:20.166 --> 48:22.541
I'm Dr. Tomas.
I'm the trauma neurosurgeon.

48:22.625 --> 48:23.750
Hi, Christin.

48:23.833 --> 48:26.416
I don't know how much you know, but...

48:26.541 --> 48:27.666
-Very little.
-Yeah.

48:27.750 --> 48:30.416
Viljar has sustained severe injuries.

48:30.916 --> 48:33.166
Gunshot wounds to both of his arms

48:33.458 --> 48:36.583
and to his lower extremity
on the right side.

48:37.041 --> 48:39.916
But what concerns us mostly is that

48:40.000 --> 48:43.250
one of the bullets exploded in his head.

48:44.458 --> 48:45.291
OK.

48:45.375 --> 48:48.541
So, I needed to do
emergency surgery on him.

48:48.875 --> 48:50.833
And it was a bit complex.

48:50.958 --> 48:53.958
There are several bullet fragments
close to his brain stem.

48:54.333 --> 48:55.833
What does this mean?

48:57.500 --> 48:59.250
That means if he survives,

48:59.833 --> 49:02.416
we will have to perform
another surgery, but...

49:03.000 --> 49:05.083
but his condition is critical.

49:05.958 --> 49:08.833
-Can we see him?
-Oh, yeah. Please.

49:11.958 --> 49:13.708
-You want to see him?
-Yes.

49:17.291 --> 49:18.500
So, please. 

49:34.250 --> 49:36.541
Sir? The press are waiting outside.

49:37.166 --> 49:38.000
One moment.

49:39.416 --> 49:40.958
We've got the final number.

49:41.375 --> 49:42.666
Eight dead in Oslo.

49:43.208 --> 49:44.958
Sixty-nine on Utøya.

49:49.708 --> 49:50.583
Wounded?

49:51.291 --> 49:52.541
At least 200.

49:54.833 --> 49:55.666
Thank you.

49:57.541 --> 49:59.583
We are all shocked.

50:00.750 --> 50:03.333
This was an attack on our government

50:03.833 --> 50:05.333
and on our children.

50:06.625 --> 50:09.291
We are a long way from understanding why.

50:10.250 --> 50:11.500
But what is clear

50:11.583 --> 50:15.916
is that our nation has been attacked
by someone who would see it changed.

50:17.625 --> 50:19.958
He would see our democracy
become tyranny.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.375
See our humanity fall.

50:25.625 --> 50:27.375
We must not give in to this terror.

50:29.041 --> 50:29.958
We must fight.

50:31.875 --> 50:33.625
But we must not become changed.

50:34.750 --> 50:37.208
Instead, we must strengthen our values

50:38.166 --> 50:41.375
and fight this terror with
the rule of law...

50:42.291 --> 50:44.541
not the barrel of the gun.

50:46.916 --> 50:47.750
Thank you.

50:56.250 --> 50:57.583
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

51:12.833 --> 51:16.041
I had a very happy upbringing.
I grew up in West Oslo.

51:17.250 --> 51:20.375
My parents divorced amicably
when I was very young.

51:20.458 --> 51:21.375
Sit down.

51:22.791 --> 51:25.125
I maintain a close relationship
with my mother.

51:26.750 --> 51:30.291
My half-sister and I are not very close,
but we speak occasionally.

51:31.416 --> 51:34.791
-What about your father?
-I haven't seen him since I was 16.

51:35.416 --> 51:38.833
We spoke a couple of years ago,
but there was really no time to meet.

51:38.916 --> 51:40.750
I was too focused on my career,

51:41.291 --> 51:44.000
my Internet businesses,
and he was living in France.

51:44.833 --> 51:48.333
How would you describe
your relationship with your mother?

51:48.541 --> 51:50.666
My mother had nothing to do with this.
She's not relevant.

51:51.375 --> 51:54.750
It's all about understanding what...
led you to do this.

51:57.458 --> 51:59.875
How many children do you have,
Mr. Lippestad?

52:03.250 --> 52:04.083
Five.

52:05.333 --> 52:06.416
And you love them?

52:07.708 --> 52:08.791
Yes, of course.

52:11.375 --> 52:14.791
I wanted to hit them
where it would hurt the most.

52:51.875 --> 52:56.291
So, he buys 900 kilos of fertilizer
and aluminium nitrate,

52:57.125 --> 52:59.000
and there were no red flags?

53:00.166 --> 53:02.083
Our focus has been on Islamist terror.

53:02.875 --> 53:06.666
-We know the far right is growing fast.
-We can't stop every threat.

53:07.625 --> 53:09.416
We did the best we could, sir.

53:10.916 --> 53:13.416
We all know that this is not good enough.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.291
I want to upgrade our national security.

53:21.541 --> 53:24.458
Intelligence, defense, policing.

53:26.333 --> 53:27.833
And I'm ordering a public inquiry.

53:28.750 --> 53:32.166
An inquiry into what happened
and how we responded.

53:33.791 --> 53:36.916
Something went badly wrong,
and we need to find out what.

53:38.791 --> 53:41.041
It's the only way
we will get through this.

53:44.541 --> 53:48.000
Christin asked me to call.
She's suspending the campaign.

53:49.500 --> 53:51.875
We're going to be staying here in Oslo
with Viljar.

53:52.208 --> 53:54.291
And Torje is here with us, so he...

53:55.333 --> 53:56.708
I called the school, yeah.

53:58.666 --> 54:01.166
Yeah. They're operating on him again now.

54:17.083 --> 54:18.125
Hi.

54:18.333 --> 54:21.000
Nice to see you.
I just came from the operating room.

54:21.625 --> 54:24.083
And... I'm sorry...

54:25.333 --> 54:28.000
that I don't bring better news than this,

54:28.083 --> 54:31.708
but I tried to get
the bullet fragments out,

54:31.791 --> 54:34.250
and I managed to take some of them out...

54:35.541 --> 54:36.375
but not all.

54:36.875 --> 54:38.083
I had to leave...

54:38.833 --> 54:41.666
some of them that were close
to his brain stem.

54:41.750 --> 54:44.125
It would have been too dangerous,
unfortunately.

54:44.958 --> 54:48.666
So, it's-- If he wakes up now...

54:50.958 --> 54:54.791
and he's not the same as he was...

54:55.708 --> 54:59.750
To evaluate his brain injury,
we have to wait and see if he wakes up.

55:00.125 --> 55:05.083
It's up to him now, but we are trying
to do everything to save Viljar's life.

55:08.458 --> 55:09.291
Thank you.

55:14.708 --> 55:15.666
This is...

55:16.750 --> 55:19.291
This is so wrong. This is-- This is wrong.

55:30.166 --> 55:31.916
It was a very dysfunctional family.

55:32.791 --> 55:35.791
Breivik's parents split acrimoniously
when he was very young.

55:37.833 --> 55:40.416
She wrote to social services
and asked for help.

55:41.041 --> 55:43.750
They had serious doubts about
the mother's capacity to parent.

55:44.125 --> 55:45.166
And his father?

55:45.750 --> 55:48.375
After the marriage collapsed,
his father cut him off.

55:49.500 --> 55:52.916
-And what about his half-sister?
-She emigrated to California.

55:53.250 --> 55:56.208
-He was about sixteen, I think.
-Sixteen, seventeen?

55:56.291 --> 55:57.791
-Yeah, something like that.
-OK.

55:58.541 --> 56:01.000
So, it was just him and his mother
after that.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.916
Well, he was obviously very isolated
all the way into adulthood.

56:06.125 --> 56:08.083
Not exactly the picture he painted.

56:08.166 --> 56:09.375
No, no, it's not.

56:12.541 --> 56:13.375
So...

56:14.875 --> 56:16.791
what are we talking about here?

56:19.458 --> 56:21.250
Developing insanity...

56:23.333 --> 56:24.250
as a defense?

56:25.041 --> 56:25.875
I think so.

56:26.500 --> 56:28.208
How else do we explain it?

56:33.166 --> 56:34.000
Yes.

56:48.333 --> 56:51.958
So, I've been appointed by your son
to lead his defense.

56:53.625 --> 56:57.458
Now, I know that he doesn't have
a relationship with his father,

56:57.541 --> 56:59.916
so I wanted to ask you some questions.

57:01.666 --> 57:03.625
What was Anders like as a child?

57:06.083 --> 57:08.916
He was-- He was a normal boy.

57:09.666 --> 57:12.833
Was kind and clever.

57:14.416 --> 57:15.750
He loved affection.

57:18.208 --> 57:21.833
Since his father left us,
I was a single parent.

57:23.791 --> 57:25.500
Any mental health issues?

57:26.166 --> 57:27.041
No.

57:27.833 --> 57:29.041
Was he ever violent?

57:29.666 --> 57:30.541
Never.

57:33.291 --> 57:37.166
Now, did you ever have any dealings
with social services?

57:38.125 --> 57:43.125
After his father left, I thought I needed
their help, but I didn't. He was fine.

57:48.041 --> 57:52.125
Did you have any sense recently
that Anders was...

57:52.833 --> 57:54.000
having problems?

57:54.500 --> 57:55.333
No.

57:55.791 --> 57:56.625
I...

57:57.666 --> 58:01.375
told the police that I saw
he had guns in his bedroom.

58:02.500 --> 58:06.916
But he told me he needed them
for hunting, and... I believed him.

58:10.833 --> 58:13.291
Will you consider testifying
in Anders' defense?

58:17.708 --> 58:18.708
What would I say?

58:20.250 --> 58:23.166
Just that there were problems
in his childhood.

58:23.250 --> 58:24.333
It would help him.

58:25.541 --> 58:26.541
But then...

58:27.458 --> 58:29.500
everyone will know who I am.

58:38.083 --> 58:41.416
Anders is entitled to a defense.

58:43.958 --> 58:45.500
Just like everyone else.

58:52.083 --> 58:53.041
I can't do it.

58:59.833 --> 59:01.333
Thank you for your time.

59:04.833 --> 59:05.833
He...

59:10.541 --> 59:12.750
He's kind of right, though, isn't he?

59:15.833 --> 59:17.500
The way the country's going.

59:21.750 --> 59:23.416
It's not like it used to be.

59:26.583 --> 59:28.166
These are difficult times.

59:34.250 --> 59:37.083
His situation is still quite critical.

59:39.041 --> 59:43.500
He's still asleep,
but we are fighting an infection.

59:45.333 --> 59:47.916
-I will be around.
-Yeah, thank you so much.

1:00:01.041 --> 1:00:03.083
...and each survivor I've met

1:00:03.166 --> 1:00:06.875
is going through
the most grueling personal recovery.

1:00:07.166 --> 1:00:09.541
But they do not go through this alone.

1:00:09.833 --> 1:00:12.416
When he attacked them, he attacked us all.

1:00:12.750 --> 1:00:15.583
Here then, we'll hear shortly
about the Prime Minister's...

1:00:46.875 --> 1:00:47.708
Hello.

1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:50.833
You fucking Nazi lover.
I know where you live.

1:00:52.125 --> 1:00:54.916
I'm going to make sure you
and your family rot in hell.

1:01:08.416 --> 1:01:11.125
The Prime Minister today announced
an official inquiry

1:01:11.208 --> 1:01:13.458
into the attacks of the 22nd of July.

1:01:13.625 --> 1:01:18.333
This will be led by one of Oslo's
leading lawyers, Mrs. Alexandra Gerig.

1:01:19.208 --> 1:01:21.291
-I've just met with the Prime Minister.
-Hi.

1:01:21.375 --> 1:01:23.208
He's asked me to conduct a searching

1:01:23.291 --> 1:01:24.916
-and independent inquiry...
-Let me help you.

1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:26.708
...into what happened
on the 22nd of July...

1:01:26.791 --> 1:01:28.500
-You OK?
-Yes.

1:01:28.583 --> 1:01:31.000
Our work will begin immediately.
Thank you.

1:01:31.083 --> 1:01:33.416
This inquiry is of vital importance.

1:01:33.875 --> 1:01:36.375
Whatever went wrong, we must confront it.

1:01:36.875 --> 1:01:40.916
If we fail to do so,
the terrorist will surely win.

1:01:41.458 --> 1:01:42.875
Who was that on the phone?

1:01:45.208 --> 1:01:46.500
It was from the office.

1:01:48.416 --> 1:01:50.041
It's the third one tonight.

1:02:25.291 --> 1:02:26.208
Yes?

1:02:31.750 --> 1:02:32.875
I'm Lara.

1:02:33.333 --> 1:02:34.375
-Hi, Lara.
-Hi.

1:02:35.375 --> 1:02:39.125
I was also on the island.
So, I'm just here visiting survivors.

1:02:42.750 --> 1:02:43.750
How is Viljar?

1:02:47.916 --> 1:02:49.208
He needs to wake up.

1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:51.916
Yeah.

1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:56.958
Are you OK?

1:02:58.625 --> 1:03:00.625
My sister didn't make it, so...

1:03:05.333 --> 1:03:06.375
I'm so sorry.

1:03:11.125 --> 1:03:12.208
What was her name?

1:03:12.875 --> 1:03:13.791
Bano.

1:03:15.375 --> 1:03:17.250
She'd be so happy you're alive.

1:03:22.458 --> 1:03:24.625
This is Lara. She was on the island.

1:03:25.333 --> 1:03:27.458
She wanted to know how Viljar was doing.

1:03:27.541 --> 1:03:28.583
-Hi.
-Oh, hi.

1:03:29.333 --> 1:03:30.958
-Hi. Are you OK?
-Hi.

1:03:31.291 --> 1:03:34.291
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Do you know Viljar well?

1:03:36.333 --> 1:03:38.250
I think everyone loves Viljar.

1:03:39.250 --> 1:03:41.666
I just played against him
in a football tournament, so--

1:03:41.750 --> 1:03:42.833
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1:03:42.958 --> 1:03:44.250
Yeah, he fouled you.

1:03:47.833 --> 1:03:48.708
Yeah.

1:03:49.333 --> 1:03:50.958
But I'll leave you, so...

1:03:51.416 --> 1:03:54.666
-Maybe I can come back when he wakes up?
-Yes, please. Very kind of you.

1:03:54.750 --> 1:03:55.583
OK.

1:03:58.250 --> 1:03:59.083
Take care.

1:04:06.666 --> 1:04:09.583
My recommendation is that...

1:04:10.625 --> 1:04:12.250
you plead insanity.

1:04:13.916 --> 1:04:17.375
The Court will have you assessed
by a forensic psychiatrist.

1:04:18.416 --> 1:04:21.416
They'll give a diagnosis,
and the Court will then decide

1:04:21.500 --> 1:04:22.791
whether to accept it.

1:04:22.875 --> 1:04:26.291
If they do,
you'll go to hospital for treatment.

1:04:27.375 --> 1:04:28.875
-Not jail?
-Not jail.

1:04:34.833 --> 1:04:36.375
People will be very angry.

1:04:38.208 --> 1:04:41.208
-It's the law.
-Will I be able to address the Court?

1:04:41.541 --> 1:04:45.458
I will petition them, and you will have
the same rights as any other defendant.

1:04:48.125 --> 1:04:48.958
OK.

1:05:03.583 --> 1:05:04.625
Listen.

1:05:04.958 --> 1:05:06.166
Is he choking?

1:05:09.666 --> 1:05:11.041
He's choking.

1:05:11.375 --> 1:05:13.166
-Can't you help him?
-He's gagging.

1:05:13.250 --> 1:05:14.458
Can you call someone?

1:05:16.416 --> 1:05:18.541
Can you come to room five? Quickly.

1:05:26.833 --> 1:05:27.791
Hi.

1:05:30.541 --> 1:05:31.625
Hi. What's going on?

1:05:31.708 --> 1:05:33.666
-He's gagging.
-He's reacting to the tube.

1:05:34.583 --> 1:05:35.875
OK, that's good news.

1:05:36.083 --> 1:05:38.000
I think we should extubate him.

1:05:38.333 --> 1:05:39.583
Saturation is good.

1:05:39.916 --> 1:05:42.250
Viljar, I'm going to take this tube
out of your throat.

1:05:42.333 --> 1:05:44.208
There's going to be a slight discomfort.

1:05:44.625 --> 1:05:46.500
-Are you ready?
-We are here, Viljar.

1:05:46.625 --> 1:05:48.625
-We are here with you.
-OK, on three.

1:05:48.708 --> 1:05:50.708
One, two, three.

1:05:55.875 --> 1:05:57.041
OK, the tube's out.

1:05:58.333 --> 1:05:59.625
Viljar, do you hear me?

1:06:03.541 --> 1:06:04.791
Very good, Viljar.

1:06:05.583 --> 1:06:07.666
Can you raise your left arm?

1:06:11.500 --> 1:06:12.333
Yes.

1:06:12.416 --> 1:06:13.625
Yes, he can.

1:06:15.708 --> 1:06:16.916
Very good, Viljar.

1:06:17.416 --> 1:06:20.041
Can you move the fingers
of your right arm?

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:24.125
Unbelievable.

1:06:24.750 --> 1:06:26.000
Where are you from?

1:06:27.625 --> 1:06:29.958
S-- Sval-- Svalbard.

1:06:50.958 --> 1:06:52.083
What happened?

1:06:53.916 --> 1:06:55.458
It was a terrorist attack.

1:06:56.333 --> 1:06:57.166
You were shot.

1:06:57.666 --> 1:06:59.541
But it's over. You're safe now.

1:07:00.916 --> 1:07:02.500
Is Torje OK?

1:07:03.375 --> 1:07:05.250
-I'm here.
-Torje's fine.

1:07:05.625 --> 1:07:07.250
He's absolutely fine, Viljar.

1:07:10.125 --> 1:07:11.916
There was so much shooting.

1:07:13.750 --> 1:07:14.833
Yes.

1:07:16.208 --> 1:07:17.208
Yes.

1:07:18.416 --> 1:07:19.625
By just one man.

1:07:21.250 --> 1:07:22.958
Some kind of right wing extremist.

1:07:24.333 --> 1:07:25.750
How many did he kill?

1:07:31.125 --> 1:07:32.458
Seventy-seven.

1:07:43.666 --> 1:07:47.125
Simon and Anders are dead, Viljar.
I'm so sorry.

1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:11.666
Simon! Simon!

1:08:15.541 --> 1:08:16.791
Viljar!

1:08:26.541 --> 1:08:27.708
-You OK?
-Yes.

1:08:49.416 --> 1:08:50.583
OK.

1:08:51.416 --> 1:08:56.041
It is clear that this is going to be
a long recovery.

1:08:56.916 --> 1:08:58.500
Two or three years.

1:08:59.833 --> 1:09:01.875
Of course there's brain damage

1:09:02.541 --> 1:09:07.875
and these bullet fragments
that are close to you brain stem,

1:09:08.958 --> 1:09:11.041
these fragments, they could shift.

1:09:11.708 --> 1:09:12.708
And...

1:09:13.291 --> 1:09:14.500
that could be fatal.

1:09:15.083 --> 1:09:16.041
So...

1:09:16.416 --> 1:09:19.125
we are going to have to take it
one day at a time.

1:09:22.250 --> 1:09:24.333
Do you have any questions for me, Viljar?

1:09:24.416 --> 1:09:28.375
Is there anything you are wondering about?
Your rehabilitation or...

1:09:29.875 --> 1:09:31.875
-No.
-You sure you don't want to ask anything?

1:09:31.958 --> 1:09:33.208
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

1:09:44.041 --> 1:09:45.083
OK, Viljar?

1:09:45.916 --> 1:09:48.458
Can you give me a minute?

1:09:51.375 --> 1:09:52.208
Yes.

1:09:52.833 --> 1:09:53.666
Of course.

1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:12.916
Is it necessary to restrain my client?

1:10:15.625 --> 1:10:16.666
For the moment, yes.

1:10:19.833 --> 1:10:23.791
So, I imagine every psychiatrist
in the world envies you right now.

1:10:26.333 --> 1:10:27.583
Why do you say that?

1:10:28.625 --> 1:10:32.166
Because I'm the monster,
and you get to look inside my head.

1:10:34.541 --> 1:10:36.166
You think you're a monster?

1:10:36.666 --> 1:10:37.500
No.

1:10:38.583 --> 1:10:39.750
But I think you do.

1:10:40.791 --> 1:10:42.333
You can read our minds?

1:10:43.166 --> 1:10:45.416
Within 70% of accuracy.

1:10:48.333 --> 1:10:50.875
Do you know
or do you think you know?

1:10:51.750 --> 1:10:52.625
I know.

1:10:53.250 --> 1:10:54.500
And there's a difference.

1:10:55.708 --> 1:10:59.041
-You think people can read your mind?
-Sometimes.

1:10:59.916 --> 1:11:01.458
I think they try.

1:11:02.416 --> 1:11:07.083
Did you feel like that before
the attacks or... is it a new feeling?

1:11:08.375 --> 1:11:11.083
It's not new, but it got worse
when I was planning the attacks.

1:11:11.875 --> 1:11:12.875
Worse?

1:11:13.458 --> 1:11:14.625
Yeah, much worse.

1:11:19.250 --> 1:11:20.208
It's OK.

1:11:29.416 --> 1:11:31.250
Just take a deep breath now.

1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.875
-I'm so sorry.
-Can you give him something for the pain?

1:11:41.958 --> 1:11:43.291
-Yes, we can--
-No! No!

1:11:43.500 --> 1:11:45.500
No more morphine.

1:11:47.583 --> 1:11:49.125
We're done now. OK?

1:11:56.916 --> 1:11:57.833
Hi.

1:11:58.041 --> 1:11:59.000
Hi.

1:12:00.291 --> 1:12:01.708
What are you doing here?

1:12:02.583 --> 1:12:03.791
I live around here.

1:12:04.125 --> 1:12:06.541
Yeah, we're checking on survivors.

1:12:08.541 --> 1:12:10.666
-Can I come in?
-Yeah, sure.

1:12:25.208 --> 1:12:26.458
How are you feeling?

1:12:28.583 --> 1:12:31.125
I'm... OK.

1:12:33.625 --> 1:12:34.666
And you?

1:12:36.291 --> 1:12:37.625
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:12:39.708 --> 1:12:44.000
I was in the shower block when it started,
so I managed to run and hide.

1:12:47.833 --> 1:12:50.250
But I got separated from my sister Bano.

1:12:58.041 --> 1:12:59.958
I'm sorry about Simon and Anders, too.

1:13:04.458 --> 1:13:05.791
It's shit.

1:13:10.333 --> 1:13:12.333
How's the food here? Is it OK?

1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.375
It's pretty shit, too.

1:13:18.250 --> 1:13:20.000
Actually, it's really shit.

1:13:20.833 --> 1:13:23.166
If you want, I can bring you something.

1:13:23.250 --> 1:13:26.000
-Food or anything.
-No. No, I'm fine.

1:13:26.166 --> 1:13:27.791
I don't have much appetite.

1:13:29.750 --> 1:13:32.291
Do you want anything else?
Cigarettes or...

1:13:33.041 --> 1:13:33.916
I don't know.

1:13:34.250 --> 1:13:36.125
-That would have been nice.
-OK.

1:13:36.583 --> 1:13:38.041
Except I don't smoke.

1:13:49.416 --> 1:13:50.375
Does it hurt?

1:13:50.791 --> 1:13:52.250
No, it's just...

1:13:52.541 --> 1:13:54.750
I just have to be careful.

1:13:57.833 --> 1:13:58.833
Yeah.

1:13:59.750 --> 1:14:01.250
Yeah, it's going to take time.

1:14:01.791 --> 1:14:04.000
That's what everyone keeps saying.

1:14:05.916 --> 1:14:06.958
Yeah.

1:14:09.458 --> 1:14:11.375
That's what they say to me, too.

1:14:14.166 --> 1:14:15.166
I'll...

1:14:15.875 --> 1:14:17.333
leave you in peace,

1:14:17.416 --> 1:14:21.083
but if you want, I can come back
and check in on you again.

1:14:21.250 --> 1:14:22.375
Yeah.

1:14:22.958 --> 1:14:24.083
That would be nice.

1:14:26.250 --> 1:14:27.250
OK.

1:14:30.458 --> 1:14:32.125
-Take care.
-You, too.

1:14:32.541 --> 1:14:33.625
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:14:42.833 --> 1:14:44.541
So, it's only the diagnosis.

1:14:46.416 --> 1:14:50.125
It will be up to the Court
whether to accept it.

1:14:51.291 --> 1:14:52.875
And what's their decision?

1:14:56.250 --> 1:14:58.125
Paranoid schizophrenia.

1:15:02.541 --> 1:15:06.541
In the meantime, the judge
has modified the terms of your detention.

1:15:07.708 --> 1:15:10.166
You're allowed to read newspapers.

1:15:13.250 --> 1:15:16.000
And here, you got some mail.

1:15:22.333 --> 1:15:25.000
Geir, I told you they'd be angry.

1:15:43.416 --> 1:15:44.500
Fan mail.

1:15:48.250 --> 1:15:50.250
I will be allowed to speak at the trial.

1:15:50.833 --> 1:15:52.375
This hasn't been decided yet.

1:15:52.458 --> 1:15:55.625
Now, that's very important. There are
witnesses I need to cross-examine.

1:16:10.041 --> 1:16:12.375
Anders, you can't call the Prime Minister.

1:16:13.458 --> 1:16:15.083
And Norway isn't on trial.

1:16:16.041 --> 1:16:16.875
You are.

1:16:19.958 --> 1:16:21.250
Are you sure about that?

1:16:24.625 --> 1:16:27.250
Come up. Come on, come on.

1:16:27.666 --> 1:16:28.791
Very good, come up.

1:16:28.875 --> 1:16:30.458
Come up. Yes.

1:16:31.500 --> 1:16:32.666
Yeah, very good.

1:16:33.041 --> 1:16:34.666
Come on. And the right leg.

1:16:37.458 --> 1:16:38.583
Good.

1:16:38.875 --> 1:16:40.541
Very good. Come on, come on.

1:16:43.166 --> 1:16:44.208
Come on.

1:16:45.083 --> 1:16:46.333
Yes, very good.

1:16:47.041 --> 1:16:49.583
One more. Come on, come on.

1:16:51.666 --> 1:16:52.916
Come on. Yes.

1:16:54.041 --> 1:16:55.250
And breathe.

1:17:00.125 --> 1:17:02.458
-I can't do this.
-Very good, Viljar, come on.

1:17:02.541 --> 1:17:04.541
No. No, it's not.

1:17:06.250 --> 1:17:08.000
I'm not enjoying this campaign.

1:17:09.208 --> 1:17:10.458
People are angry.

1:17:11.166 --> 1:17:12.875
Well, shouldn't you be there?

1:17:13.625 --> 1:17:14.875
I'm not leaving you.

1:17:15.333 --> 1:17:17.416
So, how will that work on election night?

1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:19.166
I'll Skype.

1:17:20.250 --> 1:17:21.291
Skype?

1:17:21.958 --> 1:17:25.000
Seriously? What kind of mayor does that?

1:17:25.708 --> 1:17:27.000
A mother mayor.

1:17:30.666 --> 1:17:33.416
Maybe you could Skype with me,
if you feel up to it.

1:17:34.916 --> 1:17:36.166
Only if you win.

1:17:37.125 --> 1:17:38.041
I'll try.

1:17:44.583 --> 1:17:45.625
Take it.

1:17:46.750 --> 1:17:49.416
-I'll call them later. It's OK.
-Seriously, take it.

1:17:49.916 --> 1:17:50.958
It's important.

1:17:51.958 --> 1:17:53.500
It's a fucking election.

1:17:56.291 --> 1:17:57.208
OK.

1:18:00.041 --> 1:18:01.375
Hi, how are you?

1:18:03.666 --> 1:18:04.500
Yeah?

1:18:06.166 --> 1:18:07.041
That's nice.

1:18:07.291 --> 1:18:11.958
...seventy-seven people,
on the 22nd of July, is criminally insane.

1:18:12.083 --> 1:18:15.541
They believe Mr. Breivik,
who was responsible for the attack...

1:18:18.041 --> 1:18:22.375
...suffers from paranoid schizophrenia,
and has done so for several years.

1:18:22.708 --> 1:18:25.958
If the Court upholds these findings
in the trial,

1:18:26.041 --> 1:18:30.750
it could result in Breivik being sent
to a psychiatric hospital for treatment,

1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:32.708
avoiding any jail time.

1:18:33.041 --> 1:18:35.166
The defendant is described by...

1:18:44.750 --> 1:18:45.708
Viljar?

1:18:46.708 --> 1:18:47.958
He can't get to you.

1:18:48.833 --> 1:18:50.708
He's never going to get to you.

1:18:55.291 --> 1:18:59.333
Although the Labour Party is expected
to make small gains across the country,

1:18:59.541 --> 1:19:03.458
polls suggest that eventually power
will shift to a coalition of parties.

1:19:03.583 --> 1:19:07.000
Ms. Solberg has been accused
of wasting what some are calling

1:19:07.083 --> 1:19:11.125
a once-in-a-lifetime boom
in the national economy. Across Europe...

1:19:11.208 --> 1:19:15.833
...groups like the Progress Party
entering government for the first time,

1:19:15.916 --> 1:19:19.541
an anti-immigration movement
that used to count Anders Breivik himself

1:19:19.625 --> 1:19:20.583
amongst its members.

1:19:20.666 --> 1:19:21.750
Hi.

1:19:22.708 --> 1:19:24.583
Yeah, everyone is there. That's good.

1:19:25.583 --> 1:19:28.208
-Yeah, and you can see me?
-Yes, I can see you.

1:19:29.291 --> 1:19:30.416
OK.

1:19:31.916 --> 1:19:37.041
I just want to say that I'm really honored
to become mayor of Svalbard.

1:19:37.583 --> 1:19:40.833
And I just want to thank you
for being so understanding.

1:19:41.125 --> 1:19:44.666
As you know,
this has been a difficult time for us,

1:19:45.291 --> 1:19:47.833
but hopefully we will be home soon.

1:19:48.833 --> 1:19:52.166
So, yeah.
And Viljar wants to say something.

1:19:52.250 --> 1:19:54.333
-Hey, Viljar!
-Hi, everybody.

1:19:56.125 --> 1:19:59.041
I just wanted to say
that I'm really proud of my mom.

1:19:59.541 --> 1:20:00.916
And hopefully they...

1:20:01.375 --> 1:20:05.083
they'll let me out of this place soon,
and we'll all get home for Christmas.

1:20:05.166 --> 1:20:07.416
-Stay strong, mate.
-Get home soon, Viljar!

1:20:07.500 --> 1:20:09.916
OK. Maybe we all should say goodbye.

1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:12.000
We'll see you soon, Christin! Goodbye!

1:20:13.583 --> 1:20:14.666
Bye-bye.

1:20:15.333 --> 1:20:16.625
-See you soon.
-Bye.

1:20:16.708 --> 1:20:18.208
-Bye-bye.
-Congratulations!

1:20:33.666 --> 1:20:35.166
They're saying he's insane.

1:20:41.333 --> 1:20:42.833
Do you think he's insane?

1:20:43.458 --> 1:20:44.458
I don't know.

1:20:46.041 --> 1:20:46.916
Maybe.

1:20:48.250 --> 1:20:49.458
I saw him.

1:20:49.833 --> 1:20:52.208
He knew what he was doing. Definitely.

1:20:59.250 --> 1:21:01.791
What are you going to do
when you get out of here?

1:21:07.208 --> 1:21:09.166
I-- I can't see the future.

1:21:09.250 --> 1:21:11.833
I just can't see it. It's like I'm...

1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:14.833
out in this no-man's-land.

1:21:19.041 --> 1:21:20.375
Do you know what I mean?

1:21:22.458 --> 1:21:23.333
Yeah.

1:21:24.833 --> 1:21:26.333
But we survived, right?

1:21:29.708 --> 1:21:31.166
What does that even mean?

1:21:34.541 --> 1:21:35.791
I really don't know.

1:21:45.208 --> 1:21:47.916
How do the families feel
about Breivik's insanity plea?

1:21:48.250 --> 1:21:50.541
I can say on behalf of my client

1:21:50.833 --> 1:21:55.166
that they strongly oppose
Mr. Breivik's psychiatric diagnosis.

1:21:55.541 --> 1:21:58.791
And as the coordinating lawyer
for the families and survivors

1:21:58.875 --> 1:22:00.666
of the 22nd of July attacks,

1:22:01.208 --> 1:22:05.875
I will be petitioning the Court today
to order further assessments.

1:22:06.166 --> 1:22:10.375
We demand that Mr. Breivik faces justice

1:22:10.958 --> 1:22:13.291
and is held accountable. Thank you.

1:22:16.750 --> 1:22:17.833
Good afternoon.

1:22:20.958 --> 1:22:24.041
After careful consideration,

1:22:24.416 --> 1:22:26.750
the Court has decided to allow

1:22:27.041 --> 1:22:30.750
further psychiatric assessment
of Mr. Breivik.

1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:32.833
Your Honor,

1:22:34.208 --> 1:22:37.583
the families welcome this decision
and they thank you.

1:22:38.333 --> 1:22:42.958
We will, of course, be calling
our own psychiatric experts.

1:22:43.041 --> 1:22:44.000
Thank you.

1:22:46.250 --> 1:22:47.166
Your Honor,

1:22:47.375 --> 1:22:50.833
the Court has already had Mr. Breivik
psychiatrically examined.

1:22:51.250 --> 1:22:55.291
Allowing further assessments
has no precedent in law.

1:22:55.875 --> 1:22:58.041
-Thank you.
-Mr. Lippestad...

1:22:59.916 --> 1:23:03.125
the Court is trying to do
what's best for Norway.

1:23:05.666 --> 1:23:07.333
Of course, Your Honor. Thank you.

1:23:08.541 --> 1:23:09.500
Thank you all.

1:24:08.291 --> 1:24:10.041
Do you want me to take your jacket?

1:24:10.541 --> 1:24:12.083
Let me put the bags here.

1:24:21.500 --> 1:24:22.916
OK. Thanks.

1:25:35.291 --> 1:25:36.916
Thank you so much for coming in.

1:25:37.750 --> 1:25:39.208
This is very difficult.

1:25:40.958 --> 1:25:42.916
Some of the parents are unhappy.

1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:45.958
They-- There have been complaints,

1:25:47.041 --> 1:25:49.375
because you are defending
such a dangerous man.

1:25:50.208 --> 1:25:51.083
Meaning?

1:25:52.916 --> 1:25:55.333
They think the school might be a target.

1:25:55.416 --> 1:25:57.208
Oh, for God's sake.

1:25:57.333 --> 1:25:58.958
I know it's very unlikely,

1:25:59.333 --> 1:26:02.666
but we have to think about
what's best for everyone.

1:26:03.250 --> 1:26:04.208
So...

1:26:04.916 --> 1:26:06.625
what exactly are you saying?

1:26:07.500 --> 1:26:09.333
We wonder if you...

1:26:10.208 --> 1:26:12.166
perhaps should find another school.

1:26:17.791 --> 1:26:18.708
I'm sorry.

1:26:20.458 --> 1:26:21.416
It's OK.

1:26:29.583 --> 1:26:30.416
Hey, hey.

1:26:37.583 --> 1:26:39.833
-How are you?
-Hi, girl, how are you?

1:26:49.916 --> 1:26:50.958
Hi, Anders.

1:26:53.125 --> 1:26:54.625
I want to change my plea.

1:26:56.875 --> 1:26:58.416
-What?
-I'm not insane.

1:27:00.958 --> 1:27:02.083
I was playing a role.

1:27:03.541 --> 1:27:06.458
-What role?
-I was playing the monster in a nightmare,

1:27:06.541 --> 1:27:10.083
but I'm not a monster.
I'm a soldier in a war, doing my duty.

1:27:11.291 --> 1:27:14.375
A leader.
And a leader doesn't give away his power.

1:27:14.625 --> 1:27:16.916
I've allowed the families to take control.

1:27:17.333 --> 1:27:20.083
But this is my trial.
I decide how it ends.

1:27:20.166 --> 1:27:22.833
I have to prove
that these attacks meant something.

1:27:24.166 --> 1:27:26.125
You'll go to prison
for the rest of your life.

1:27:27.708 --> 1:27:31.083
I have to finish what I've started,
and standing up in that court...

1:27:32.958 --> 1:27:34.500
that's the third attack.

1:27:37.583 --> 1:27:38.958
That's the whole point.

1:27:42.791 --> 1:27:43.958
That's how I win.

1:27:45.625 --> 1:27:47.416
He wants to change his defense.

1:27:48.625 --> 1:27:50.041
He wants to plead guilty.

1:27:50.625 --> 1:27:53.166
Has he given any reason? I mean, why?

1:27:54.083 --> 1:27:55.541
He wants to stay in control.

1:27:56.250 --> 1:27:58.083
And he knows the consequences.

1:27:58.958 --> 1:28:02.166
He wants to stand up
and be accountable for his actions.

1:28:02.250 --> 1:28:03.916
The psychiatric assessment was clear.

1:28:04.500 --> 1:28:07.125
The prosecution are legally obliged
to stick with it.

1:28:08.916 --> 1:28:10.500
How do we get around that?

1:28:16.333 --> 1:28:18.083
OK, so we have to start again.

1:28:18.958 --> 1:28:22.375
Infer that he knew what he was doing
every step of the way.

1:28:23.166 --> 1:28:25.875
That only someone rational
could have planned and executed

1:28:25.958 --> 1:28:27.541
something this complex.

1:28:28.250 --> 1:28:30.541
And then we have
to look into the far right

1:28:30.791 --> 1:28:33.083
and find witnesses who share his beliefs,

1:28:33.416 --> 1:28:35.916
so we can show that he's not alone
in his views.

1:28:36.791 --> 1:28:38.750
And that's the only way we can do this.

1:29:05.833 --> 1:29:06.833
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:29:09.666 --> 1:29:10.875
It's good to be back.

1:29:14.666 --> 1:29:15.500
Hi.

1:29:16.041 --> 1:29:18.125
-How are you?
-Welcome.

1:29:18.208 --> 1:29:20.041
-Thank you so much.
-Glad to see you.

1:29:20.125 --> 1:29:21.458
Glad to see you, too.

1:29:21.750 --> 1:29:23.541
-How's Viljar?
-Oh, he's fine.

1:30:00.041 --> 1:30:01.166
And this...

1:30:07.041 --> 1:30:08.208
Just relax.

1:30:11.125 --> 1:30:13.375
OK. How does it feel?

1:30:15.125 --> 1:30:17.000
-I don't know.
-Does it hurt?

1:30:20.250 --> 1:30:21.875
-Does it look normal?
-Yeah.

1:30:22.458 --> 1:30:24.333
-Would you like to have a look?
-Yeah.

1:30:34.541 --> 1:30:35.708
Viljar!

1:30:37.416 --> 1:30:38.250
OK?

1:30:38.708 --> 1:30:39.833
What do you think?

1:30:40.833 --> 1:30:41.875
I don't know.

1:30:44.708 --> 1:30:45.958
Viljar, how are you?

1:30:47.500 --> 1:30:49.875
My head hurts all the time.

1:30:50.875 --> 1:30:52.333
My shoulder...

1:30:54.416 --> 1:30:55.500
I have a lot of...

1:30:56.500 --> 1:30:57.875
phantom pains.

1:30:58.333 --> 1:31:02.250
OK, phantom pains are normal
when you have a serious brain injury.

1:31:03.125 --> 1:31:06.541
The bullet fragments
are sitting deeply in your brain,

1:31:06.625 --> 1:31:08.541
close to the brain stem.

1:31:08.625 --> 1:31:10.916
If they move just the slightest bit,

1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:13.791
-it is--
-I know what the fucking dangers are.

1:31:13.875 --> 1:31:16.000
I understand that you're frustrated.

1:31:16.625 --> 1:31:18.250
But you have to be careful.

1:32:08.125 --> 1:32:09.375
Mom! Dad!

1:32:10.208 --> 1:32:11.583
He's on the snowmobile!

1:32:11.916 --> 1:32:14.416
-What?
-Viljar! He's on the snowmobile.

1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:43.000
He's there.

1:33:06.708 --> 1:33:08.250
What is he doing?

1:33:12.750 --> 1:33:14.250
What the fuck is he doing?

1:33:27.416 --> 1:33:28.666
Oh, my God.

1:33:44.375 --> 1:33:46.375
-Viljar!
-Viljar.

1:33:46.958 --> 1:33:47.916
Viljar.

1:33:49.125 --> 1:33:50.083
Go away!

1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:51.833
I'm fine.

1:33:52.791 --> 1:33:54.000
-I'm fine.
-Viljar.

1:33:55.750 --> 1:33:58.250
I can't-- I can't live like this.

1:33:59.916 --> 1:34:02.375
Pretending everything
is going to get better.

1:34:03.416 --> 1:34:04.416
It's not.

1:34:05.166 --> 1:34:07.083
It's all still here in my head.

1:34:07.541 --> 1:34:10.041
And I can't-- I can't get rid of it.

1:34:11.625 --> 1:34:13.833
-What the fuck am I supposed to do?
-Come on.

1:34:18.375 --> 1:34:19.291
Tell me!

1:34:23.875 --> 1:34:24.708
I don't know.

1:34:28.083 --> 1:34:30.208
I just wish it had been me, not you.

1:34:38.583 --> 1:34:39.416
Viljar.

1:34:53.458 --> 1:34:54.583
Let's go home, OK?

1:35:17.416 --> 1:35:18.500
My client,

1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:20.208
Anders Breivik,

1:35:20.875 --> 1:35:22.875
writes about you in his manifesto.

1:35:23.625 --> 1:35:25.250
He obviously admires you.

1:35:25.958 --> 1:35:27.708
Many people admire me.

1:35:28.166 --> 1:35:29.416
It's not because of me.

1:35:30.208 --> 1:35:34.291
It's because of the ideas I have
about what's going on in the world.

1:35:36.041 --> 1:35:37.333
Did you ever meet him?

1:35:37.625 --> 1:35:38.458
Yes.

1:35:39.416 --> 1:35:43.333
But I have to be careful
who I work with, what I do.

1:35:44.250 --> 1:35:46.416
And he's not from around here, you know.

1:35:47.250 --> 1:35:48.958
He's from your side of Oslo.

1:35:49.833 --> 1:35:52.458
But, yes, we share the same vision
of the world.

1:35:54.125 --> 1:35:55.541
He says a war is coming.

1:35:57.333 --> 1:35:59.333
I'd say the war already started.

1:36:02.291 --> 1:36:04.333
Are you a member of the Knights Templar?

1:36:04.916 --> 1:36:07.083
There's so many organizations.

1:36:07.375 --> 1:36:09.791
We are very strong
all across Scandinavia,

1:36:09.875 --> 1:36:12.375
Northern Europe,
Eastern Europe, of course.

1:36:12.833 --> 1:36:15.750
Very strong in the UK,
new groups forming all the time.

1:36:18.416 --> 1:36:19.500
How about America?

1:36:20.625 --> 1:36:21.666
Storm front.

1:36:22.250 --> 1:36:23.333
Growing fast.

1:36:23.625 --> 1:36:26.333
Very fast. Joining up with Europe.

1:36:28.833 --> 1:36:30.041
You know, Lippestad,

1:36:30.833 --> 1:36:33.416
there's a lot of fear and anger out there.

1:36:35.375 --> 1:36:39.333
And that's why tomorrow
is going to belong to us.

1:36:42.875 --> 1:36:45.041
Will you testify in my client's defense?

1:36:57.708 --> 1:36:59.666
We got an e-mail from the lawyers.

1:37:01.625 --> 1:37:04.375
There's a briefing on the mainland,
they want us to go.

1:37:06.041 --> 1:37:08.375
So we know what to expect from the trial.

1:37:15.541 --> 1:37:16.458
You should go.

1:37:21.875 --> 1:37:22.708
Sveinn.

1:37:25.750 --> 1:37:28.583
We both need to engage in this.
It's important.

1:37:30.041 --> 1:37:32.416
Engaging nearly cost our sons
their lives.

1:37:33.416 --> 1:37:34.625
They're still here.

1:37:35.250 --> 1:37:36.166
Are they?

1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:43.291
I don't care about
Anders fucking Breivik and his trial.

1:37:45.166 --> 1:37:48.708
I just want us to get on with our lives.
That's it. That's all.

1:37:53.125 --> 1:37:54.125
OK.

1:38:18.166 --> 1:38:19.000
Hi.

1:38:20.750 --> 1:38:22.333
I haven't heard from you.

1:38:23.041 --> 1:38:25.083
I was just wondering if you're OK.

1:38:26.625 --> 1:38:28.291
Call me if you want to talk.

1:38:44.541 --> 1:38:45.375
Hey.

1:38:46.833 --> 1:38:48.666
-Hey.
-You want to...

1:38:49.375 --> 1:38:50.875
watch a movie or something?

1:38:52.125 --> 1:38:55.166
Maybe later. I'm just doing some music.

1:39:14.625 --> 1:39:15.458
Torje...

1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:18.833
talk to me.

1:39:21.875 --> 1:39:22.708
I'm fine.

1:39:25.791 --> 1:39:26.750
No, you're not.

1:39:30.416 --> 1:39:31.958
You know you can talk to me.

1:39:37.541 --> 1:39:39.125
You're the one who got hurt.

1:39:40.291 --> 1:39:41.166
Not me.

1:39:45.541 --> 1:39:46.791
You were there, too.

1:39:57.125 --> 1:39:57.958
Look...

1:40:00.083 --> 1:40:02.916
I'm sorry Mom and Dad have been
looking after me so much.

1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:09.833
I know it has been... tough for you.

1:40:13.333 --> 1:40:14.458
But we're home now.

1:40:18.958 --> 1:40:19.875
Yeah.

1:40:43.041 --> 1:40:47.541
So, the Court has decided
that Breivik can speak in his own defense.

1:40:48.083 --> 1:40:48.916
Yes.

1:40:50.125 --> 1:40:51.416
I understand.

1:40:51.500 --> 1:40:54.250
How can it be right
that he's allowed to speak? How?

1:40:54.333 --> 1:40:57.625
The Court has to preserve his rights.
And he does have rights.

1:41:02.041 --> 1:41:03.791
He doesn't have any rights.

1:41:04.458 --> 1:41:08.291
You're talking about the man who killed
my son! I would hang him from a tree!

1:41:11.625 --> 1:41:12.458
No!

1:41:12.875 --> 1:41:15.791
He shouldn't be allowed to turn this trial
into propaganda.

1:41:15.916 --> 1:41:19.916
I agree and I'm going to be there
to make sure that doesn't happen.

1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:24.250
We are closing the trial
with victims' testimonies.

1:41:24.333 --> 1:41:27.333
That's why it's important
that those who survived

1:41:27.416 --> 1:41:32.041
speak about their experience
to stand up against his defense.

1:41:32.416 --> 1:41:35.708
I think it would be
a very, very strong statement.

1:41:36.083 --> 1:41:39.916
He gets to speak. My daughter's
too scared to leave her bedroom.

1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:41.541
What about my daughter's voice?

1:41:41.625 --> 1:41:44.291
They would be the voices
of those who cannot speak,

1:41:44.666 --> 1:41:46.083
because they were there.

1:41:46.791 --> 1:41:48.791
And we need to hear their stories.

1:42:03.958 --> 1:42:05.583
They've sent Viljar a letter.

1:42:07.208 --> 1:42:09.291
They want him to testify at the trial.

1:42:10.916 --> 1:42:12.375
He doesn't have to do it.

1:42:13.833 --> 1:42:16.083
We can just get the doctor to excuse him.

1:42:20.583 --> 1:42:21.875
Maybe he needs to do it.

1:42:25.208 --> 1:42:26.458
What does that mean?

1:42:29.083 --> 1:42:30.666
Maybe he needs to face it.

1:42:32.333 --> 1:42:35.291
-How do we know it won't set him back?
-We don't.

1:42:36.375 --> 1:42:37.916
It's a hell of a risk.

1:42:44.833 --> 1:42:45.958
It's his choice.

1:43:17.291 --> 1:43:18.208
Hi.

1:43:18.625 --> 1:43:19.625
Hey.

1:43:21.041 --> 1:43:22.750
I've been worried about you.

1:43:24.083 --> 1:43:25.041
I'm fine.

1:43:27.041 --> 1:43:29.375
I just received a letter.

1:43:30.541 --> 1:43:31.958
They want me to appear.

1:43:32.458 --> 1:43:33.500
At the trial.

1:43:34.250 --> 1:43:36.250
Yeah. Me, too.

1:43:37.833 --> 1:43:39.708
Do you think you can face him?

1:43:48.750 --> 1:43:49.750
Viljar!

1:43:50.375 --> 1:43:51.458
Are you still there?

1:43:52.083 --> 1:43:53.375
Yeah, I'm here.

1:43:55.458 --> 1:43:57.000
Do you think you can do it?

1:43:58.416 --> 1:43:59.250
Well...

1:43:59.750 --> 1:44:02.166
I can't even walk down the fucking street.

1:44:15.125 --> 1:44:16.000
Your Honor,

1:44:16.083 --> 1:44:19.416
on the 22nd of July, 2011,

1:44:20.166 --> 1:44:21.916
Anders Behring Breivik

1:44:22.833 --> 1:44:25.416
carried out a dual terror attack,

1:44:25.666 --> 1:44:29.166
taking the lives of 77 innocent people.

1:44:30.041 --> 1:44:34.791
Hundreds more were injured
and left forever scarred by his actions.

1:44:36.625 --> 1:44:40.250
Mr. Breivik initially entered
a plea of insanity.

1:44:41.666 --> 1:44:45.166
Now he wishes to be held accountable
for his actions,

1:44:45.791 --> 1:44:47.750
but Norwegian law is clear.

1:44:48.958 --> 1:44:50.375
If there is any doubt

1:44:50.833 --> 1:44:54.500
as to Mr. Breivik's state of mind
on the 22nd of July,

1:44:55.250 --> 1:44:56.958
we, the prosecution,

1:44:57.041 --> 1:45:02.291
have no choice but to request
the Court to find him guilty,

1:45:03.791 --> 1:45:08.375
but sentence him to
mandatory psychiatric treatment

1:45:08.708 --> 1:45:09.833
in a secure facility.

1:45:12.416 --> 1:45:13.708
We will not seek

1:45:14.500 --> 1:45:18.166
to deny the crimes committed
on July 22nd.

1:45:18.791 --> 1:45:21.416
However, we will argue
that Mr. Breivik

1:45:21.916 --> 1:45:25.375
was not psychotic during these attacks.

1:45:26.583 --> 1:45:31.125
Instead, we say he knew exactly
what he was doing.

1:45:31.916 --> 1:45:34.250
These were political acts.

1:45:38.958 --> 1:45:40.000
Mr. Breivik.

1:46:13.750 --> 1:46:16.833
Today I speak on behalf of Europeans

1:46:17.583 --> 1:46:19.458
who have been deprived

1:46:19.958 --> 1:46:23.125
of their ethnic, indigenous,

1:46:23.708 --> 1:46:26.333
cultural, and territorial rights.

1:46:28.166 --> 1:46:30.708
The prosecution tell you I'm insane.

1:46:32.250 --> 1:46:35.125
They do this because they fear me.

1:46:35.875 --> 1:46:38.708
Because I have committed
the most sophisticated,

1:46:38.958 --> 1:46:43.083
the most spectacular
political assassination in Europe

1:46:43.625 --> 1:46:45.625
since World War II.

1:46:46.541 --> 1:46:47.625
And why?

1:46:48.833 --> 1:46:50.958
Because Norway,

1:46:51.583 --> 1:46:52.583
Europe...

1:46:53.333 --> 1:46:55.208
these are not real democracies.

1:46:55.916 --> 1:46:59.375
Is it democratic for a nation
not to be consulted

1:46:59.458 --> 1:47:01.875
about whether it becomes multicultural?

1:47:02.333 --> 1:47:06.666
To force them to become a minority
in their own capital?

1:47:08.416 --> 1:47:11.958
Many will realize this
in the coming decades

1:47:12.041 --> 1:47:14.958
and pick up arms, just as I did.

1:47:15.833 --> 1:47:17.958
The defendant has said enough, Your Honor.

1:47:18.041 --> 1:47:19.833
You must hurry up, Mr. Breivik.

1:47:19.916 --> 1:47:21.708
I must be allowed to finish my statement.

1:47:21.791 --> 1:47:23.875
This is very upsetting for the families.

1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:27.708
Your Honor, the defendant must be allowed
to finish his statement. Thank you.

1:47:28.833 --> 1:47:31.125
You may continue, Mr. Breivik.

1:47:32.833 --> 1:47:36.333
When peaceful revolution
is made impossible,

1:47:37.208 --> 1:47:41.166
then violent revolution
is the only option.

1:47:42.291 --> 1:47:46.750
I demand to be acquitted
because I acted in defense of my country.

1:47:53.791 --> 1:47:55.125
I got eight weeks.

1:47:58.166 --> 1:47:59.708
I want to walk unassisted.

1:48:00.750 --> 1:48:04.041
No stick, no shaking, no breathlessness.

1:48:05.916 --> 1:48:07.875
You're still very weak.

1:48:09.750 --> 1:48:12.041
Just tell me what I need to do.

1:48:16.291 --> 1:48:18.416
Thank you for coming today,
Prime Minister.

1:48:18.958 --> 1:48:22.583
I want to begin to explore to what extent
government was aware

1:48:22.958 --> 1:48:25.333
of the threat posed
by Anders Behring Breivik

1:48:25.416 --> 1:48:27.708
prior to his attacks on the 22nd of July.

1:48:27.833 --> 1:48:30.083
That was obviously a question
that concerned me greatly.

1:48:30.625 --> 1:48:33.333
The Security Services told me
they had no warnings,

1:48:33.500 --> 1:48:35.833
that he operated completely out of sight.

1:48:36.208 --> 1:48:39.750
Prime Minister, our investigation
suggests something different.

1:48:42.250 --> 1:48:46.083
We have discovered
that Mr. Breivik's purchase of chemicals

1:48:46.166 --> 1:48:48.208
that he used in the construction
of the bomb

1:48:48.625 --> 1:48:53.416
came to the attention
of the Customs Services in January, 2011.

1:48:54.041 --> 1:48:56.083
But this was not acted on.

1:48:56.166 --> 1:48:58.666
That was not what I was told, Madam Chair.

1:49:00.083 --> 1:49:04.291
Can we turn to the issues of physical
security around government quarters?

1:49:05.250 --> 1:49:06.958
You can turn to tab three.

1:49:07.833 --> 1:49:09.666
It appears from the papers

1:49:09.750 --> 1:49:12.541
there were proposals discussed
inside government

1:49:12.625 --> 1:49:16.666
to improve physical security
around the Prime Minister's office.

1:49:17.666 --> 1:49:19.958
Were you aware of these discussions?

1:49:22.166 --> 1:49:26.208
The Knights Templar
are a network of patriots

1:49:26.625 --> 1:49:30.791
who think the way I do and are willing
to pick up arms just as I did,

1:49:31.541 --> 1:49:33.833
in order to defend their way of life.

1:49:34.208 --> 1:49:37.500
Mr. Breivik, you told the police
that this organization

1:49:37.583 --> 1:49:40.416
was set up in 2002.

1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:43.875
-Is this true?
-Yes, after September 11th.

1:49:46.416 --> 1:49:48.875
Did you attend this first meeting?

1:49:49.333 --> 1:49:50.166
I did.

1:49:51.875 --> 1:49:52.916
What happened?

1:49:55.291 --> 1:49:56.791
I was given my mission.

1:49:57.250 --> 1:49:58.083
This mission.

1:49:58.166 --> 1:50:02.083
Mr. Breivik, the police have tracked
your movements in 2002

1:50:02.583 --> 1:50:06.333
and found no evidence
that you attended such a meeting.

1:50:06.750 --> 1:50:08.541
Can you explain this?

1:50:09.333 --> 1:50:10.750
It was a covert meeting.

1:50:11.458 --> 1:50:13.500
But now it is no longer a secret, so...

1:50:14.750 --> 1:50:17.541
can you prove this meeting
actually took place?

1:50:18.125 --> 1:50:19.083
No comment.

1:50:20.541 --> 1:50:23.500
Can you tell me the names
of those who attended the meetings?

1:50:24.083 --> 1:50:25.083
No comment.

1:50:25.250 --> 1:50:30.750
The man responsible for Norway's suffering
and the deaths of 77 people

1:50:31.333 --> 1:50:34.708
showed no sign of regret
as he was brought into the courtroom.

1:50:34.958 --> 1:50:36.291
He was ready...

1:50:36.375 --> 1:50:39.166
...here, it's odd to see someone so calm,

1:50:39.333 --> 1:50:41.916
even relaxed, in such circumstances.

1:50:42.250 --> 1:50:44.500
He's fascinating to watch and...

1:50:44.583 --> 1:50:48.041
...completely relaxed, excited even.
It's like this room is his stage.

1:50:48.125 --> 1:50:51.416
It was built especially for his trial.
So I guess in some way, that's true.

1:50:51.541 --> 1:50:53.708
He can't help but smile at the camera.

1:50:53.791 --> 1:50:55.958
He's in control here while all...

1:50:56.208 --> 1:50:58.333
-No! No, one more.
-One more.

1:50:58.416 --> 1:50:59.416
-One more.
-One more.

1:51:00.125 --> 1:51:04.750
Then I carefully began to assemble
the components of the bomb.

1:51:05.708 --> 1:51:09.291
I did it very slowly, of course,
so that the authorities wouldn't see me.

1:51:09.375 --> 1:51:10.916
Turning to the attacks.

1:51:11.666 --> 1:51:13.125
Did you feel empathy

1:51:13.875 --> 1:51:14.875
for the victims?

1:51:19.500 --> 1:51:21.708
Shall I make this easier for you all?

1:51:23.416 --> 1:51:25.625
I will forgo any appeal,

1:51:26.375 --> 1:51:30.416
any retrial,
I will spare the families all of this,

1:51:31.250 --> 1:51:32.916
if the Court finds me sane.

1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:46.916
Good.

1:51:55.916 --> 1:51:57.625
-Are you OK?
-Yes.

1:51:57.833 --> 1:51:59.583
-I think your parents are here.
-OK.

1:51:59.666 --> 1:52:00.875
See you tomorrow.

1:52:01.541 --> 1:52:02.541
See you tomorrow.

1:52:19.500 --> 1:52:20.583
I'm not ready.

1:52:23.416 --> 1:52:24.500
That's OK.

1:52:25.250 --> 1:52:27.833
-You don't need to do it.
-No, it's not.

1:52:29.250 --> 1:52:32.291
-I need to do it.
-Then don't push yourself so hard.

1:52:32.791 --> 1:52:34.833
Just say a few words, that's all.

1:52:36.916 --> 1:52:38.958
-And say what?
-What happened.

1:52:40.125 --> 1:52:41.083
The truth.

1:52:43.916 --> 1:52:45.291
That I cry in my sleep?

1:52:47.750 --> 1:52:49.583
That I can't talk to strangers?

1:52:52.500 --> 1:52:54.083
That I'm frightened of dying?

1:52:57.291 --> 1:52:59.750
I'd rather not go than let him hear that.

1:53:03.250 --> 1:53:04.500
Then what is it you want?

1:53:08.250 --> 1:53:09.541
I want to smash him

1:53:09.958 --> 1:53:11.416
into a bloody pulp.

1:53:13.166 --> 1:53:16.708
I want to smash his fucking face in.

1:53:19.958 --> 1:53:21.666
For what he did to everyone.

1:53:23.416 --> 1:53:25.041
For what he did to Simon...

1:53:25.541 --> 1:53:26.458
and Anders...

1:53:27.500 --> 1:53:28.541
and Torje.

1:53:30.458 --> 1:53:31.291
And you.

1:53:33.916 --> 1:53:35.208
I want to make him...

1:53:36.500 --> 1:53:37.916
see what he's done.

1:53:46.166 --> 1:53:47.583
I just want to beat him.

1:53:49.833 --> 1:53:51.541
Then maybe this is your chance.

1:53:58.708 --> 1:54:00.541
Have you ever met the defendant?

1:54:01.208 --> 1:54:03.708
-I met him online.
-Online?

1:54:04.250 --> 1:54:05.666
Yes, online,

1:54:05.750 --> 1:54:09.083
in a chat forum
attached to mythic military games

1:54:09.166 --> 1:54:11.791
like World of Warcraft, Call of Duty.

1:54:12.625 --> 1:54:14.375
It's a place to train.

1:54:14.916 --> 1:54:17.375
-It's a place to share ideas.
-Recruit?

1:54:19.541 --> 1:54:20.375
Of course.

1:54:20.916 --> 1:54:23.458
How did the defendant strike you?

1:54:25.541 --> 1:54:28.333
He liked to lead missions.

1:54:29.583 --> 1:54:30.416
Online.

1:54:32.458 --> 1:54:33.416
Was he rational?

1:54:34.291 --> 1:54:35.125
Perfectly.

1:54:37.041 --> 1:54:38.083
Was he a leader?

1:54:39.208 --> 1:54:40.875
He certainly wanted to be.

1:54:43.583 --> 1:54:46.250
Was Mr. Breivik your leader?

1:54:47.708 --> 1:54:48.750
No, he was not.

1:54:49.333 --> 1:54:51.666
You wouldn't follow Mr. Breivik?

1:54:52.250 --> 1:54:54.875
I think others are better qualified
than him.

1:54:55.500 --> 1:54:57.916
Oh, so, better than Breivik?

1:54:59.000 --> 1:54:59.916
Definitely.

1:55:00.041 --> 1:55:05.125
Would they be capable of doing
what Anders Behring Breivik did?

1:55:06.041 --> 1:55:10.125
The Alt Right, the Far Right,
you can call us whatever you want,

1:55:10.708 --> 1:55:14.041
we're deadly serious about seizing power,

1:55:14.125 --> 1:55:16.750
about changing society completely.

1:55:18.500 --> 1:55:21.291
And a single man's violent acts

1:55:22.125 --> 1:55:24.541
won't help us to reach that goal.

1:55:29.041 --> 1:55:30.916
He's a coward. He's a fucking coward.

1:55:33.250 --> 1:55:37.041
I mean, to betray me like that?
You never betray a brother. Never.

1:55:37.958 --> 1:55:40.625
There are millions of people out there
who support me.

1:55:40.833 --> 1:55:42.250
And this is the best you can do?

1:55:42.958 --> 1:55:44.166
He was the only one.

1:55:45.250 --> 1:55:47.958
I'm a Commander
in the Knights Templar Europe.

1:55:56.625 --> 1:55:57.875
What about my mother?

1:56:00.750 --> 1:56:02.458
She could say I was normal.

1:56:03.541 --> 1:56:04.958
She won't do it, either.

1:56:07.625 --> 1:56:08.625
Pathetic.

1:56:10.375 --> 1:56:13.750
You know there's not once
when I could rely on her?

1:56:15.125 --> 1:56:16.916
-Not even once.
-Anders...

1:56:18.500 --> 1:56:23.416
there isn't one single person
who will agree to defend your actions.

1:56:25.916 --> 1:56:27.291
I don't need anyone.

1:57:30.083 --> 1:57:31.250
We were refugees.

1:57:33.166 --> 1:57:34.666
We were running from war.

1:57:37.333 --> 1:57:40.041
It took a very long time
for Norway to feel like home.

1:57:42.750 --> 1:57:45.333
And some people
were really suspicious of us.

1:57:46.250 --> 1:57:48.875
They were angry that we were even here.

1:57:50.416 --> 1:57:53.000
But my sister Bano, she really helped me.

1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:55.541
She told me that Norway...

1:57:56.750 --> 1:57:57.916
Norway's great.

1:58:00.166 --> 1:58:02.416
It could mean security

1:58:03.041 --> 1:58:03.916
for us.

1:58:05.250 --> 1:58:06.083
And freedom.

1:58:07.291 --> 1:58:08.125
And hope.

1:58:11.958 --> 1:58:15.958
And that's exactly what I felt
around the campfire at Utøya...

1:58:17.250 --> 1:58:18.500
the night before.

1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:23.125
But the next day,

1:58:23.958 --> 1:58:25.541
when we were attacked and...

1:58:28.125 --> 1:58:29.583
and when my sister died...

1:58:31.666 --> 1:58:33.125
I just lost all that.

1:58:36.333 --> 1:58:37.291
I just...

1:58:38.041 --> 1:58:42.541
had to live in a world of pain and fear...

1:58:44.208 --> 1:58:45.500
and so much anger.

1:58:47.833 --> 1:58:49.708
And I would just-- Sorry.

1:58:52.500 --> 1:58:54.458
I've just been feeling so guilty.

1:58:57.208 --> 1:58:58.833
I just keep on wondering...

1:58:59.791 --> 1:59:02.625
how did I live when she died?

1:59:07.250 --> 1:59:08.166
And...

1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:11.041
And how do I face my parents?

1:59:11.916 --> 1:59:13.791
And what do I say to my brother?

1:59:17.833 --> 1:59:18.833
Then I just...

1:59:20.291 --> 1:59:23.875
I just couldn't understand
why anyone would want to kill us.

1:59:26.958 --> 1:59:29.875
I don't understand
what's so frightening about me.

1:59:34.500 --> 1:59:35.458
Thank you.

1:59:36.916 --> 1:59:38.041
Thank you, Lara.

1:59:59.291 --> 2:00:00.125
You OK?

2:00:01.333 --> 2:00:02.541
Yeah, I'm fine.

2:01:12.791 --> 2:01:13.666
Look...

2:01:17.125 --> 2:01:18.833
I'm sorry I got lost...

2:01:19.916 --> 2:01:22.416
the last few months. I just...

2:01:22.666 --> 2:01:23.583
It's OK.

2:01:25.833 --> 2:01:26.833
So did I.

2:01:34.416 --> 2:01:35.541
How close is he?

2:01:36.875 --> 2:01:38.791
I couldn't see from the TV.

2:01:39.500 --> 2:01:40.625
He's really close.

2:01:42.958 --> 2:01:45.541
You don't have to look at him
if you don't want to.

2:01:49.333 --> 2:01:51.208
Do you know what you're going to say?

2:01:51.333 --> 2:01:54.000
I'm trying to think of things...

2:01:56.208 --> 2:01:57.791
but I get confused.

2:02:00.375 --> 2:02:02.208
I just don't want to be weak.

2:02:02.958 --> 2:02:03.833
That's all.

2:02:04.958 --> 2:02:06.208
Not in front of him.

2:02:15.416 --> 2:02:17.416
You can be weak and still strong.

2:02:18.916 --> 2:02:20.208
You know that, right?

2:02:32.666 --> 2:02:34.083
You're going to be great.

2:02:39.750 --> 2:02:40.666
Thanks.

2:02:45.375 --> 2:02:46.500
I should get back.

2:02:52.041 --> 2:02:54.083
-See you tomorrow?
-See you tomorrow.

2:04:29.791 --> 2:04:31.583
Wait. I just need a minute.

2:04:53.625 --> 2:04:54.541
You OK?

2:04:55.750 --> 2:04:57.125
Yeah, I'm fine.

2:05:01.833 --> 2:05:02.666
Thank you.

2:05:43.250 --> 2:05:44.833
Please, sit down, Viljar.

2:05:59.000 --> 2:06:02.208
Can you tell us what happened to you
on Utøya, Viljar?

2:06:04.250 --> 2:06:05.083
Yes.

2:06:09.500 --> 2:06:10.708
He tried to...

2:06:10.916 --> 2:06:12.083
Simon! Simon!

2:06:14.333 --> 2:06:15.583
He tried to kill me.

2:06:16.500 --> 2:06:17.583
Viljar!

2:06:20.416 --> 2:06:21.375
I remember...

2:06:23.916 --> 2:06:24.750
seeing him...

2:06:28.958 --> 2:06:30.166
and running away.

2:06:34.958 --> 2:06:36.833
Trying to find somewhere to hide...

2:06:40.625 --> 2:06:42.458
and protecting my little brother.

2:06:43.750 --> 2:06:45.583
I remember being shot...

2:06:49.875 --> 2:06:50.916
five times.

2:06:53.625 --> 2:06:54.666
When I was...

2:06:56.750 --> 2:06:58.958
lying on the beach, I was...

2:07:00.958 --> 2:07:01.791
all alone.

2:07:03.250 --> 2:07:06.458
In a kind of pain I couldn't imagine.

2:07:07.375 --> 2:07:08.750
But now you are here.

2:07:09.541 --> 2:07:11.208
But everything's different.

2:07:12.250 --> 2:07:14.750
I've had to relearn how to use my body.

2:07:17.625 --> 2:07:19.083
Learn how to walk again.

2:07:20.750 --> 2:07:23.166
How to feed myself again.

2:07:24.416 --> 2:07:27.041
I have little use of my left arm.

2:07:28.541 --> 2:07:29.750
And I'm...

2:07:31.916 --> 2:07:33.541
I'm blind in one eye.

2:07:34.791 --> 2:07:36.125
But that's...

2:07:37.375 --> 2:07:38.791
That's a relief.

2:07:40.291 --> 2:07:41.708
A relief? How do you mean?

2:07:44.333 --> 2:07:45.458
A relief

2:07:46.208 --> 2:07:47.291
in a way that

2:07:47.750 --> 2:07:50.166
at least now I don't have to look at him.

2:08:00.625 --> 2:08:03.083
But of course it's not that simple. I...

2:08:05.625 --> 2:08:07.541
I have a fragment of his bullet...

2:08:08.833 --> 2:08:10.000
lodged in my brain

2:08:11.041 --> 2:08:13.708
that could kill me at any time.

2:08:17.333 --> 2:08:20.625
And I don't look like the person
I used to anymore. I'm...

2:08:22.208 --> 2:08:23.708
My body, it's...

2:08:27.250 --> 2:08:28.625
it's broken.

2:08:29.333 --> 2:08:31.000
And the worst is that he...

2:08:40.458 --> 2:08:41.833
he killed...

2:08:44.416 --> 2:08:45.458
Anders and Simon...

2:08:47.125 --> 2:08:48.208
my best friends.

2:08:51.250 --> 2:08:53.291
Stopping them from making their...

2:08:53.833 --> 2:08:55.541
their mark on the world, and...

2:08:56.625 --> 2:08:59.125
and they would have made it
a better place. And I...

2:08:59.791 --> 2:09:01.166
I miss them every day.

2:09:09.750 --> 2:09:11.000
I'm sorry, I...

2:09:13.833 --> 2:09:15.458
I didn't...

2:09:17.333 --> 2:09:18.666
I didn't want to cry.

2:09:21.750 --> 2:09:24.416
I so much didn't want to cry
in front of him. I...

2:09:25.625 --> 2:09:27.041
I wanted to stay strong.

2:09:30.041 --> 2:09:31.666
Because I do this for them.

2:09:35.416 --> 2:09:37.041
So they will not be forgotten.

2:09:40.916 --> 2:09:42.375
When you shot them and...

2:09:44.833 --> 2:09:48.041
left me alone on the beach...

2:09:50.083 --> 2:09:51.583
I didn't know if I was

2:09:52.416 --> 2:09:53.791
living or dying.

2:09:56.041 --> 2:09:58.083
And I've been stuck there ever since.

2:10:01.500 --> 2:10:02.416
But now...

2:10:05.250 --> 2:10:06.083
I realize...

2:10:08.541 --> 2:10:09.875
that I got a choice.

2:10:16.041 --> 2:10:19.333
Because I still have family...

2:10:21.166 --> 2:10:22.166
and friends...

2:10:24.958 --> 2:10:26.000
and memories.

2:10:28.750 --> 2:10:29.750
Dreams.

2:10:32.291 --> 2:10:33.166
Hope.

2:10:35.041 --> 2:10:35.875
And love.

2:10:39.458 --> 2:10:40.666
And he doesn't.

2:10:43.708 --> 2:10:44.666
He's...

2:10:45.958 --> 2:10:47.416
completely alone.

2:10:50.625 --> 2:10:53.375
And he's going to rot there in prison,
whereas I...

2:10:56.625 --> 2:10:57.666
I survived.

2:11:01.833 --> 2:11:03.125
And I choose to live.

2:11:17.875 --> 2:11:18.875
I'm done.

2:11:22.708 --> 2:11:23.833
Thank you, Viljar.

2:11:39.250 --> 2:11:40.250
Let's go home.

2:12:06.208 --> 2:12:08.708
The report provides
a comprehensive account

2:12:08.791 --> 2:12:12.333
of events leading up
to the 22nd of July attacks.

2:12:12.416 --> 2:12:15.916
It concludes that Breivik could have been
detected earlier

2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:18.708
and that Oslo police should have
responded more quickly

2:12:18.791 --> 2:12:21.125
to his attack on Utøya Island.

2:12:21.333 --> 2:12:25.833
The inquiry also found that failures
of leadership and communication,

2:12:25.916 --> 2:12:30.583
police lack of resources, and access
to helicopters potentially...

2:12:47.791 --> 2:12:48.625
Hello.

2:12:49.791 --> 2:12:50.666
Hi.

2:12:52.833 --> 2:12:53.791
Good to see you.

2:12:59.916 --> 2:13:01.208
Thank you for meeting me.

2:13:04.416 --> 2:13:07.083
First of all, I want to say... I'm sorry.

2:13:12.083 --> 2:13:13.875
We should have done better.

2:13:18.875 --> 2:13:21.000
I should have done better.

2:13:29.375 --> 2:13:30.583
We all think that...

2:13:32.125 --> 2:13:35.541
the responsibility lies
with the terrorist.

2:13:36.875 --> 2:13:37.708
Only him.

2:13:38.291 --> 2:13:39.291
Not you.

2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:44.375
And Norway still needs you...
to help us get through this.

2:13:52.250 --> 2:13:54.291
The verdict is unanimous.

2:13:55.208 --> 2:13:57.375
And the conclusion is as follows.

2:13:58.958 --> 2:14:01.791
The Court finds Anders Behring Breivik

2:14:02.208 --> 2:14:04.458
guilty of all charges

2:14:05.458 --> 2:14:08.416
and we judge him accountable
for his actions.

2:14:10.916 --> 2:14:12.416
Anders Behring Breivik

2:14:12.708 --> 2:14:16.166
is therefore sentenced
to indefinite solitary confinement,

2:14:17.041 --> 2:14:20.583
for as long as he remains a threat
to society.

2:14:49.750 --> 2:14:52.541
So, now the trial is complete.

2:14:55.833 --> 2:14:56.958
Please sign here.

2:14:57.500 --> 2:14:58.916
Just some formalities.

2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:04.833
Thank you.

2:15:08.916 --> 2:15:10.375
Do you think you'll visit me?

2:15:13.375 --> 2:15:14.791
I don't think so, Anders.

2:15:17.166 --> 2:15:18.166
So, we're done.

2:15:19.708 --> 2:15:21.666
Yes. My job is finished.

2:15:36.291 --> 2:15:37.125
Geir?

2:15:38.875 --> 2:15:40.875
I'd do it all again if I could.

2:15:42.625 --> 2:15:43.916
You didn't win, Anders.

2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:45.833
You failed.

2:15:46.833 --> 2:15:49.916
There will be others to finish
what I've started.

2:15:51.625 --> 2:15:52.833
And we will beat you.

2:15:53.250 --> 2:15:55.166
My children and their children.

2:15:55.958 --> 2:15:57.041
They will beat you.

2:15:57.416 --> 2:15:58.791
You can't even see us.

2:16:04.375 --> 2:16:05.541
Goodbye, Anders.

2:16:25.416 --> 2:16:27.000
-Thank you. Bye.
-Bye-bye.
