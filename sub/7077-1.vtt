WEBVTT

00:02.447 --> 00:04.270
Troy and Abed back from summer.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.258
Wait a minute.
Something's changed.

00:09.259 --> 00:11.387
Oh, there's 12 additional
thumb tacks on that board.

00:11.388 --> 00:12.388
They're driving me crazy.

00:13.462 --> 00:16.415
No, I meant this.
Trying out the hipster look.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.618
It's cool, but also not.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.170
Hey, guys, have a good summer?

00:21.171 --> 00:23.022
Take them off.

00:24.324 --> 00:26.792
Happy first day of school.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.094
Oh.

00:28.095 --> 00:30.463
Good morning.
I brought brownies.

00:30.464 --> 00:33.599
Oh.

00:33.600 --> 00:38.504
Congratulations, it's me.

00:38.505 --> 00:41.507
Huh, I see we've all reinvented
ourselves over the summer.

00:41.508 --> 00:43.609
A little late
to the hipster party much?

00:43.610 --> 00:45.528
A little much on the much much?

00:46.697 --> 00:48.814
We should get to class?
Where's Pierce?

00:48.815 --> 00:50.650
- I don't know.
- Hey-o!

00:52.202 --> 00:54.036
Sorry, I'm late.

00:54.037 --> 00:56.122
Damn Mexican cleaning woman
did a cha-cha

00:56.123 --> 00:59.191
on my glasses,
so I got to wear this old pair.

01:02.162 --> 01:04.881
Abed.
Abed.

01:04.882 --> 01:07.366
- Abed.
- Yup.

01:07.367 --> 01:08.367
Did you go to your happy place?

01:08.368 --> 01:09.368
- Yeah.
- Did you envision

01:09.369 --> 01:11.671
a babbling brook
like I described?

01:11.672 --> 01:12.838
I started out
with a babbling brook,

01:12.839 --> 01:14.357
but then I layered in elements
from our world.

01:14.358 --> 01:16.092
I'm sure fans of the babbling
brook will complain,

01:16.093 --> 01:17.393
but I thought
that was limiting.

01:17.394 --> 01:19.011
Well, it's best
to keep it simple.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.363
- It was a babbling brook.
- Okay.

01:20.364 --> 01:21.898
Here's the deal, Jessica Biel.

01:21.899 --> 01:25.017
The first day of senior year
is emotional for everyone,

01:25.018 --> 01:27.353
so I hereby therapize you to go

01:27.354 --> 01:30.523
to your happy place
whenever you feel stressed.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.826
- I found my lucky notebook.
- Found my lucky charm.

01:33.827 --> 01:37.863
Abed, you ready for our last
first day of school?

01:37.864 --> 01:39.582
Are you ready, buddy?

01:39.583 --> 01:44.503
I just need a minute.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.821
I can't believe we're finally
getting into this class.

02:18.822 --> 02:20.039
I can't believe there's a class

02:20.040 --> 02:21.240
called "The History
of Ice Cream."

02:21.241 --> 02:24.543
Seniors!

02:24.544 --> 02:26.579
There they are.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.550
- Seniors!
- Oh, speaking of seniors,

02:31.551 --> 02:34.119
I've decided I'm going
to do senioritis this year.

02:34.120 --> 02:37.006
You know, just hangin' out
and blowin' off classes,

02:37.007 --> 02:39.925
pullin' pranks,
not sayin' my "G"s.

02:39.926 --> 02:42.094
Ooh, I'll pull
some pranks with you.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.597
Okay.
Or Jeff or whoever.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.765
You know, whoever's around.
Whatever.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.400
So, Abed, after class,
we're still doing

02:47.401 --> 02:48.768
our first-day-of-school
tradition, right?

02:48.769 --> 02:49.756
You know it.

02:49.757 --> 02:51.057
We like to make wishes
in the fountain.

02:51.058 --> 02:52.822
- Ohh!
- Fellas, I hate to tell you,

02:52.823 --> 02:53.939
wishes aren't real.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.741
If you want something bad,

02:55.742 --> 02:57.109
you have to work for it.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.110
Or use a spell.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.745
All of our wishes come true.

02:59.746 --> 03:02.314
Last year, Troy wished we got
Bin Laden and the Dorito Taco.

03:02.315 --> 03:04.083
Yeah, but Obama got credit
for both.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.085
Could you wish for Jeff
to be on time for once?

03:06.086 --> 03:08.153
No. No wasting wishes
on impossibilities.

03:08.154 --> 03:09.955
We have to make
this year count,

03:09.956 --> 03:11.257
especially
since it's the last one.

03:13.827 --> 03:16.662
Oh, no, is all this
for "The History of Ice Cream"?

03:16.663 --> 03:19.264
They overbooked it, so it's
first come, first serve now.

03:19.265 --> 03:20.694
Oh, just like real ice cream.

03:20.695 --> 03:23.267
- Guys, over here!
- Oh, Jeffrey.

03:27.770 --> 03:29.776
Jeff, I can't believe
that you came early.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.192
Don't you read
Gary's twitter feed?

03:31.193 --> 03:32.877
He posted a crisis alert
about it.

03:32.878 --> 03:34.112
I came early to save seats.

03:34.113 --> 03:36.548
Oh, you know what, girls,

03:36.549 --> 03:37.716
I gave you the old flyer.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.051
"Instagram for besties"
is in room 44.

03:40.052 --> 03:43.121
Showing up early,
helping others,

03:43.122 --> 03:44.455
sending girls away?

03:44.456 --> 03:47.092
Could this be
a whole new Jeff Winger?

03:47.093 --> 03:48.727
Don't ruin it by approving it.

03:53.482 --> 03:55.350
Oh, so that's progressed.

03:55.351 --> 03:56.601
I mean, it's progressed,

03:56.602 --> 03:58.737
but it hasn't
progressed-progressed.

03:58.738 --> 03:59.821
It's progressive.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.856
- Good luck, Troy.
- Hey!

04:01.857 --> 04:03.608
You can't just walk in here!

04:03.609 --> 04:05.810
I've been pissing in jars
for an hour

04:05.811 --> 04:07.412
trying to keep this seat.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.830
- Oh.
- Too bad, Leonard.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.648
All right, all right.

04:10.649 --> 04:12.984
All right.
Simmer Dean.

04:12.985 --> 04:15.587
This can't be good.
He's dressed as himself.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.757
Greendale's registration
system has been hacked.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.825
That's right.
Someone hacked

04:20.826 --> 04:22.827
into the supply closet
and counterfeited

04:22.828 --> 04:25.180
these "History of Ice Cream"
admission cards.

04:25.181 --> 04:29.000
Whoever did this is very good.

04:29.001 --> 04:31.436
There is only one fair way
to solve this.

04:31.437 --> 04:36.141
So follow me to...

04:38.000 --> 04:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:58.631 --> 05:02.167
The Hunger Deans!

05:02.168 --> 05:03.752
Thank you.
Thank you.

05:03.753 --> 05:06.004
There are 35 tests of strength

05:06.005 --> 05:07.305
and agility.

05:07.306 --> 05:09.557
The winner of each one
of these contests

05:09.558 --> 05:11.993
will be awarded
a red rubber ball.

05:11.994 --> 05:14.179
No ball, no ice cream.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.765
And these are impossible
to counterfeit

05:16.766 --> 05:21.385
because each one has been marked
by my distinct bite print.

05:21.386 --> 05:23.321
- Oh, lord, no.
- Yes.

05:23.322 --> 05:24.989
Guys, we need
to take this class.

05:24.990 --> 05:26.858
It's the only History credit
this semester.

05:26.859 --> 05:29.194
Whatevs.
We'll take it next semes.

05:29.195 --> 05:30.895
Ter.
Semester.

05:30.896 --> 05:32.664
But I need it now.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.417
Okay, I took
some extra classes online,

05:35.418 --> 05:37.619
and I'm one history credit away
from graduating.

05:37.620 --> 05:40.171
Jeff, you're graduating early?

05:40.172 --> 05:43.241
Well, graduating after 30
can't be characterized as early.

05:43.242 --> 05:44.542
When were you gonna tell us,
Jeff?

05:44.543 --> 05:45.710
I was working on a speech.

05:45.711 --> 05:48.346
And, believe me, it tied in
a lot of things.

05:48.347 --> 05:50.765
There was a lot of resolutions
and epiphanies.

05:50.766 --> 05:52.083
And it would have gone down
a lot better

05:52.084 --> 05:55.353
after we had taken
the ice cream class together.

05:55.354 --> 05:56.521
So that's why you were holding
our seats?

05:56.522 --> 05:58.056
For your own selfish reasons?

05:58.057 --> 06:00.091
No, I want us
to take the class together.

06:00.092 --> 06:02.260
I just want it to be
the last class we take together.

06:02.261 --> 06:04.195
I probably should have phrased

06:04.196 --> 06:05.780
- that differently.
- Fine. Win your red ball.

06:05.781 --> 06:08.199
What do I care?
I've got a senior prank to pull.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.534
- Shirley.
- Mm-hmm.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.035
So, Abed, ready
to make some wishes?

06:11.036 --> 06:13.455
Make chocolate hot dogs
a reality?

06:13.456 --> 06:14.622
Actually, why don't you go
with Britta?

06:14.623 --> 06:16.074
I think I'll just hang out here
and watch.

06:16.075 --> 06:17.408
Really?
Are you sure?

06:17.409 --> 06:20.378
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- F-i-n-e or f-y-n-e?

06:20.379 --> 06:22.547
We made one of 'em a code
for "not fine."

06:22.548 --> 06:25.283
- Oh.
- F-y-n-e.

06:25.284 --> 06:26.918
Okay, he's fine.
Let's go.

06:26.919 --> 06:29.304
- See you around, old Jeff.
- No.

06:29.305 --> 06:32.006
New Jeff. New Jeff does not
just look out for himself.

06:32.007 --> 06:34.225
New Jeff is gonna win
seven red balls

06:34.226 --> 06:35.810
because he is not gonna take
that class

06:35.811 --> 06:37.846
unless you guys are with me.

06:37.847 --> 06:40.732
Look, we're gonna have
to leave this place sometime.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.317
Like an ice cream cone melting

06:42.318 --> 06:46.521
in the sun, our time here
can't last forever.

06:46.522 --> 06:48.306
That was part of the speech
I was writing!

06:50.642 --> 06:51.826
Hey, guys.
What's going on?

06:51.827 --> 06:54.145
Oh, just making plans
for the future.

06:54.146 --> 06:57.031
Can't stay
at Greendale forever.

06:57.032 --> 06:58.366
Hey, is mine different
than yours?

07:00.085 --> 07:01.819
Look out below.

07:01.820 --> 07:06.657
Coming in for a land-Dean.

07:06.658 --> 07:08.593
Amelia Earhart?

07:08.594 --> 07:11.212
Close.
I am America's sexiest aviator,

07:11.213 --> 07:13.615
Leo DiCaprio.

07:13.616 --> 07:15.984
And, just as his character
lost his mind,

07:15.985 --> 07:19.721
so have I lost
your student records.

07:19.722 --> 07:22.006
What?
I can't believe it.

07:22.007 --> 07:25.026
Yeah, Amelia Earhart
would have been faster.

07:25.027 --> 07:27.779
As you know,
our student records are stored

07:27.780 --> 07:30.932
on a Microsoft Paint file,
which I was assured

07:30.933 --> 07:32.683
was future-proof.

07:32.684 --> 07:35.787
Meanwhile,
our extended warranty

07:35.788 --> 07:37.455
is not being honored
by the restaurant

07:37.456 --> 07:38.656
that used to be Circuit City.

07:39.942 --> 07:42.610
But I think the fairest way
to handle this

07:42.611 --> 07:45.964
is to have everyone repeat
the last three years.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.632
You can't be serious.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.767
In-Dean, I am.

07:51.136 --> 07:52.971
I'm gonna be here forever.

07:52.972 --> 07:56.090
Forever.
Forever. Forever.

07:56.091 --> 07:59.978
I'm gonna stay in here forever.

08:02.312 --> 08:05.434
Gentlemen... and ladies.

08:05.435 --> 08:07.019
My first red ball

08:07.020 --> 08:09.154
is way up high.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.972
To touch my ball,

08:10.973 --> 08:13.575
first touch the sky.

08:13.576 --> 08:14.993
Go!

08:14.994 --> 08:17.246
Give it up, Leonard.

08:17.247 --> 08:20.115
I'm gonna eat
your ice cream, Winger.

08:20.116 --> 08:23.202
Agh!
You? You're pre-med!

08:23.203 --> 08:24.703
- I want ice cream.
- Yeah, well, I want

08:24.704 --> 08:26.789
to graduate with dignity.

08:26.790 --> 08:28.323
Not cool!

08:31.044 --> 08:32.995
Jeff's really going
after that ball.

08:32.996 --> 08:35.898
There's got to be a joke
in there somewhere.

08:35.899 --> 08:37.182
That's my first ball.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.102
New Jeff!

08:40.102 --> 08:42.003
Give me a minute.
Give me a minute.

08:42.004 --> 08:45.107
No.

08:47.477 --> 08:49.845
You know, if we're doing the
first three years over again,

08:49.846 --> 08:50.979
I could change majors.

08:50.980 --> 08:53.515
I've always been curious
about Forensics.

08:53.516 --> 08:55.651
Hey, did you know
you could major in Antics?

08:55.652 --> 08:57.186
I checked.
You need a tomfoolery pre-req,

08:57.187 --> 08:58.737
but they waive it for women.

08:58.738 --> 09:01.123
This is lunacy.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.958
We are not gonna start over
as freshmen.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.910
Hey, there's
a freshman mixer tonight.

09:04.911 --> 09:05.911
Are you guys freshmen?

09:05.912 --> 09:09.030
We can be.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.845
This prank is amazing.

09:22.846 --> 09:25.213
He's gonna come in here later
and have the creepy feeling

09:25.214 --> 09:26.765
someone was in here.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.383
We should go
before we get caught.

09:28.384 --> 09:30.018
Well, aren't we gonna do
something now that we're here?

09:30.019 --> 09:31.720
Do something?

09:31.721 --> 09:33.989
All right.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.742
A prank on a prank.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.528
Let's move everything
on his desk over an inch

09:39.529 --> 09:41.079
except his stapler.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.581
Then he'll think
we moved his stapler.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.366
Oh, my God, there's
so many levels to this.

09:44.367 --> 09:46.502
How about we fill his car
with popcorn?

09:46.503 --> 09:48.453
That sounds messy.

09:48.454 --> 09:52.090
That sounds messy!

09:52.091 --> 09:54.910
Okay, keys.
Keys.

09:54.911 --> 09:56.879
Okay, I'm the Dean.

09:56.880 --> 09:57.963
I come into my office,

09:57.964 --> 09:59.381
turn on the light.

09:59.382 --> 10:02.634
"Oh, my, did my stapler
grow legs and move?"

10:02.635 --> 10:06.188
Then come over here for coffee.

10:06.189 --> 10:09.441
I would hide my keys

10:09.442 --> 10:14.630
in...
Huh.

10:14.631 --> 10:15.998
Oh.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.904
Heels.
Oh, you got skills.

10:21.905 --> 10:23.488
Oh.

10:23.489 --> 10:25.574
- Look who got his ball.
- Not my ball.

10:25.575 --> 10:26.658
Your ball.

10:26.659 --> 10:28.276
I just wanted you guys
to see it.

10:28.277 --> 10:30.629
- New Jeff.
- Jeffrey, is that blood on your shirt?

10:30.630 --> 10:31.880
Oh, no, it's cool.
It's Leonard's.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.582
Oh.
Oh.

10:33.583 --> 10:36.668
Two balls!

10:36.669 --> 10:40.589
This is gonna be so good
when I finally get it.

10:43.009 --> 10:45.010
It's a little weird
doing this without Abed.

10:45.011 --> 10:46.595
Come on.
It'll be fun.

10:46.596 --> 10:48.797
I'll put my...
my Britta twist on it.

10:48.798 --> 10:53.635
I got skills.
I got skills.

10:53.636 --> 10:55.270
Sorry.
Let's get this started.

10:55.271 --> 10:56.521
We always do
the first one together.

10:56.522 --> 10:58.106
One, two, three.

10:58.107 --> 11:00.242
- I wish for a great school year.
- I wish for 1,000 wishes.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.660
Great school year?

11:01.661 --> 11:03.829
The first wish
is always for 1,000 wishes.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.113
But we have all these coins.

11:05.114 --> 11:07.249
Yeah, but the coins
aren't the wishes.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.750
Oh, I didn't know that.

11:08.751 --> 11:12.704
I wish for Britta to have 499
of my remaining wishes.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.289
Thank you.

11:14.290 --> 11:15.958
I wish to end all wars.

11:15.959 --> 11:17.409
That's another rule.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.844
No wishes
containing the word "all."

11:18.845 --> 11:20.846
Guaranteed ironic consequences.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.764
I don't think
anyone's gonna miss wars.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.332
<i>Star Wars, Thumb Wars,</i>

11:24.333 --> 11:26.334
<i>wow, Storage Wars!</i>

11:26.335 --> 11:27.936
Fine.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.838
You can't get in the fountain.

11:29.839 --> 11:31.473
- I'm taking that penny back.
- I already told you,

11:31.474 --> 11:32.524
the pennies aren't wishes.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.942
You can't flip a wish.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.110
That's ridiculous.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.678
Your rules are ridiculous.

11:36.679 --> 11:38.447
They're Abed's rules.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.365
And they're awesome,
and they always work.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.402
Well, Abed's not here, so...

11:43.403 --> 11:44.519
Unwish!

11:44.520 --> 11:46.622
- You can't do that.
- I just did.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.323
- Unwish!
- No! Rewish.

11:48.324 --> 11:50.692
- Ununwish.
- Give me it! Unwish!

11:50.693 --> 11:52.577
No!

11:52.578 --> 11:54.195
No!
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:54.196 --> 11:55.664
What... you're helping me!

11:55.665 --> 11:58.216
You're helping.
I like it.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.085
- Unwish! Unwish!
- Oh, God!

12:00.086 --> 12:01.586
Why does this feel good?

12:01.587 --> 12:03.922
Stupid, selfish Jeff

12:03.923 --> 12:06.141
coming here,
ruining our senior year.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.644
Ah, great!
My "G"s are back.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.312
Yes, it's crummy
that Jeff is leaving early,

12:10.313 --> 12:12.014
but we're all graduating
eventually.

12:12.015 --> 12:13.381
But why the rush?

12:13.382 --> 12:16.184
What, so Jeff can run off
and be a gross lawyer again?

12:16.185 --> 12:17.853
Troy and Abed
start drinking coffee?

12:17.854 --> 12:20.155
I become
a boring hospital administrator?

12:20.156 --> 12:21.389
Who wants to do that?

12:21.390 --> 12:22.774
You do. Right?

12:22.775 --> 12:25.193
Yay, hospital administration!

12:25.194 --> 12:26.862
Can't wait to be buried alive

12:26.863 --> 12:28.830
under a pile of paperwork
and bed pans,

12:28.831 --> 12:31.399
just trying to summon the
courage to ask out Dr. Patel,

12:31.400 --> 12:34.336
the gorgeous Indian neurosurgeon
who doesn't even know I exist.

12:34.337 --> 12:36.071
This isn't a conversation,
is it?

12:36.072 --> 12:39.541
Whoo-hoo! The sad, slow march
toward death begins.

12:41.744 --> 12:43.595
Senioritis!

12:43.596 --> 12:46.298
Ready, set...

12:51.754 --> 12:53.972
Third ball.

12:58.895 --> 13:00.896
Fourth ball.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.573
Well, well, well.

13:11.574 --> 13:14.910
Looks like someone wants
to be a hero.

13:14.911 --> 13:16.912
A big man.
A huge, throbbing, sweaty...

13:16.913 --> 13:18.380
Dean, I just want to get
my history credit

13:18.381 --> 13:19.381
and get out of here.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.382
And I just need to know

13:20.383 --> 13:21.666
how bad you want it.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.952
The next competition
will be particularly difficult

13:23.953 --> 13:26.388
for some of you
because... lt requires

13:26.389 --> 13:28.456
complete emotional commitment.

13:28.457 --> 13:30.058
The Tango.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.343
I will be the judge.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.460
There can only be one winner,

13:32.461 --> 13:34.012
so choose your partners wisely.

13:34.013 --> 13:35.180
Come on, Winger.

13:35.181 --> 13:36.464
It's water
under the bridge, right?

13:36.465 --> 13:37.682
- Partners?
- Sorry.

13:37.683 --> 13:38.900
My dance card's full.

13:38.901 --> 13:42.521
For my partner
in the Tango competition,

13:42.522 --> 13:44.139
I choose...

13:44.140 --> 13:45.690
The Dean.

13:45.691 --> 13:48.744
The fountain works.

13:56.702 --> 13:58.086
All these balls.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.956
I'm so close, I can taste it.

14:05.494 --> 14:08.130
Pierce, only you could turn
a freshman mixer

14:08.131 --> 14:09.381
into a disaster.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.933
I was this close
to getting those two girls.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.052
Jeff, look how close you're
holding your fingers together.

14:14.053 --> 14:15.604
That's your penis.

14:17.223 --> 14:18.607
Guys, great news.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.275
After just one Forensics class,

14:20.276 --> 14:22.527
I found a way
to retrieve our student records.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.112
It turns out there's a backup.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.280
And it's in this safe.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.488
I have a theory, Dean.

14:33.489 --> 14:35.123
Do tell.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.576
I don't think
you want me to graduate.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.527
Don't be absurd, Jeffrey.

14:39.528 --> 14:41.830
I want success
for all Greendale students.

14:41.831 --> 14:44.082
Oh, really?
Then answer me this.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.251
What happened
to the other History class?

14:46.252 --> 14:49.171
What other History class?

14:49.172 --> 14:50.705
The second History class,

14:50.706 --> 14:52.340
the one
that actually taught History,

14:52.341 --> 14:54.392
that disappeared
from the schedule

14:54.393 --> 14:56.211
after I took summer classes.

14:56.212 --> 14:58.230
Oh, you're telling yourself
a fantasy.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.982
Who really made those
counterfeited ice cream tickets?

15:00.983 --> 15:03.551
Who's so good
that they got your handwriting

15:03.552 --> 15:05.687
with its hearts and flourishes?

15:05.688 --> 15:06.888
Oh, God, you're right.

15:06.889 --> 15:09.024
I can't let you go, Jeffrey.

15:09.025 --> 15:10.391
You weren't supposed
to compete.

15:10.392 --> 15:11.493
You were supposed to walk away

15:11.494 --> 15:12.727
with the rest
of the study group.

15:12.728 --> 15:15.413
You can't not get rid of me
that easily.

15:15.414 --> 15:18.867
Oh, God, why'd I make it
feats of strength and grace?

15:18.868 --> 15:22.037
It's as if I wanted you to win.

15:22.038 --> 15:24.756
But that can't be true.

15:27.188 --> 15:28.639
Smile.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.017
Best friends!

15:36.686 --> 15:39.437
Let's hug it out.
Okay.

15:39.438 --> 15:42.190
Here.
One more ball to go.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.859
But it's another dance contest,

15:43.860 --> 15:45.861
so I think I got it.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.362
What's wrong with Abed?

15:53.602 --> 15:54.936
No, no, no, no,
don't open the safe.

15:54.937 --> 15:56.204
We're redoing
our first three years.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.989
- That's what I want.
- It's okay, Abed.

15:57.990 --> 16:00.792
Here's a trick I use
when I feel overwhelmed.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.610
Just imagine a happy place

16:02.611 --> 16:05.613
and then go there.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.952
<i>* Greendale babies *</i>

16:10.953 --> 16:13.288
♪ we're happy and we're free ♪

16:13.289 --> 16:15.590
<i>* Greendale babiesTªs</i>

16:15.591 --> 16:17.659
♪ fun for you and me

16:17.660 --> 16:20.295
<i>* Greendale babies forever *</i>

16:20.296 --> 16:23.298
<i>Greendale babies
will be right back forever!</i>

16:29.367 --> 16:31.601
Pierce, what did you do
to Abed?

16:31.602 --> 16:33.570
Gay balls!

16:33.571 --> 16:35.873
Nailed it.

16:35.874 --> 16:38.909
- Don't ask.
- Don't tell.

16:38.910 --> 16:41.562
Poor Abed. Is he
in his imagination emporium?

16:41.563 --> 16:44.298
Dreamatorium. No, this seems
like something new.

16:44.299 --> 16:48.051
Abed was having some anxiety
about all the changes this year,

16:48.052 --> 16:51.472
so I may have told him to go
to a happy place in his mind.

16:51.473 --> 16:54.508
You told him to go somewhere
in his mind?

16:54.509 --> 16:56.126
Do you realize
who you told that to?

16:56.127 --> 16:57.978
The last competition
to win a red ball

16:57.979 --> 16:59.980
begins in one minute.

16:59.981 --> 17:01.181
Honestly, Jeff, you can go.

17:01.182 --> 17:04.568
No one will think
you're selfish.

17:04.569 --> 17:05.652
This looks bad.

17:05.653 --> 17:07.237
I wish I hadn't broken Abed.

17:07.238 --> 17:10.807
There is one thing
we could try.

17:10.808 --> 17:13.493
Oh, okay.

17:13.494 --> 17:15.645
I've only done this
once before.

17:20.318 --> 17:21.952
Hey, let's play Pretend.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.904
Yeah, we could be cowboys.

17:23.905 --> 17:25.355
We could be spacemen.

17:28.309 --> 17:31.345
That's right, baby Pierce.
We can play forever.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.132
- It's not working.
- What's not working?

17:35.133 --> 17:38.652
Okay, contestants, final
competition begins right now.

17:38.653 --> 17:43.056
God, I hate new Jeff.

17:43.057 --> 17:45.959
Hey, guys,
I have something to say.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.911
Yay!
Like always!

17:47.912 --> 17:49.963
I was just outside Babyville.

17:49.964 --> 17:51.565
There's nothing
outside Babyville.

17:51.566 --> 17:53.467
You know what, there is!

17:53.468 --> 17:55.836
And it was scary,

17:55.837 --> 17:57.621
because change is always scary.

17:57.622 --> 17:59.840
But then I thought of you guys,

17:59.841 --> 18:01.842
and I wasn't so scared.

18:01.843 --> 18:03.493
Abed, when you brought
this group together,

18:03.494 --> 18:06.964
you changed our lives,
but then we changed each other.

18:06.965 --> 18:08.966
And we're gonna keep changing
in unexpected ways.

18:08.967 --> 18:11.051
And we're still gonna be
friends,

18:11.052 --> 18:13.587
even if we don't all become
professors at Greendale

18:13.588 --> 18:15.839
or open a restaurant together

18:15.840 --> 18:18.475
or move into the same apartment
building after Pierce dies.

18:20.011 --> 18:21.395
Even if we go somewhere,

18:21.396 --> 18:23.430
we're not going anywhere.

18:23.431 --> 18:25.849
Aww.

18:36.527 --> 18:37.727
That was a killer speech, Jeff.

18:37.728 --> 18:39.329
- Oh.
- I didn't say anything.

18:39.330 --> 18:40.948
I literally just walked up.

18:40.949 --> 18:42.232
I know.
I made the speech for you.

18:42.233 --> 18:43.733
It hit all the right notes.

18:43.734 --> 18:45.285
I was trying to hang on to this
moment because I was so afraid

18:45.286 --> 18:47.070
of the future,
but then I realized

18:47.071 --> 18:49.139
all of this
was once the future.

18:49.140 --> 18:51.541
And it was completely different
from what I'd known before.

18:51.542 --> 18:52.876
And it was happening so fast,

18:52.877 --> 18:54.845
but in the end,
or in the now, I guess,

18:54.846 --> 18:56.213
it turned out great.

18:56.214 --> 18:57.848
And just like ice cream,

18:57.849 --> 18:59.749
we've melted together
and made a new...

18:59.750 --> 19:01.084
I just had to run the scenario
to figure it out.

19:01.085 --> 19:02.419
Oh.

19:02.420 --> 19:03.537
Sorry I missed the fountain.

19:03.538 --> 19:04.538
It's okay.

19:04.539 --> 19:05.789
Britta introduced a new rule...

19:05.790 --> 19:07.641
no rules.

19:07.642 --> 19:08.825
Cool.
We can discuss it.

19:08.826 --> 19:10.027
When they were incepting,

19:10.028 --> 19:12.729
I got their balls.

19:15.566 --> 19:17.534
Well, now that we're out
of History of Ice Cream,

19:17.535 --> 19:20.270
I can finally take
"Advanced Claims Denial."

19:20.271 --> 19:23.991
You should take "Forensics."

19:25.326 --> 19:28.695
Can somebody tell me
what the hell we just did?

19:28.696 --> 19:31.114
Jeffrey.

19:31.115 --> 19:32.115
Jeffrey, wait.

19:32.116 --> 19:33.367
Dean, what are you...

19:33.368 --> 19:35.352
Oh! You smell like the floor
of a movie theater.

19:35.353 --> 19:36.837
Yeah,
but not for the usual reasons.

19:36.838 --> 19:38.705
I have had the worst day.

19:38.706 --> 19:40.123
Our dance photo
didn't come out,

19:40.124 --> 19:41.725
someone moved my stapler,

19:41.726 --> 19:44.227
and, worst of all, I hurt you.

19:44.228 --> 19:46.013
But you'll be happy to know

19:46.014 --> 19:47.898
that we'll be offering
another History class,

19:47.899 --> 19:49.299
because I care about you.

19:49.300 --> 19:51.485
And not because I found out
if we don't offer

19:51.486 --> 19:54.438
a real History class we'll lose,
like, $40,000 in grant money.

19:54.439 --> 19:55.939
Thank you, Dean.

19:55.940 --> 19:57.240
By the way, you didn't have
to come all this way

19:57.241 --> 19:59.076
- to tell me that.
- Oh, no, it wasn't a problem.

19:59.077 --> 20:00.643
It's on my way.

20:03.147 --> 20:05.148
Please tell me
you're breaking into that condo.

20:05.149 --> 20:06.333
No, I bought it.

20:06.334 --> 20:08.285
Now we'll be
like almost roomies.

20:08.286 --> 20:11.588
<i>Oh, good, you got wine.
I've got friends with benefits.</i>

20:11.589 --> 20:12.822
No subtext.

20:12.823 --> 20:15.509
I don't know why I was
so worried about change.

20:15.510 --> 20:16.677
This year's gonna be great.

20:16.678 --> 20:18.328
I'll be right over.

20:48.429 --> 20:49.595
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

20:49.596 --> 20:50.897
Guaranteed to work.
It's an antic.

20:50.898 --> 20:54.967
Ahh!
Not so fast, you two.

20:54.968 --> 20:57.253
- Get ready to run.
- In these heels?

20:57.254 --> 21:00.373
Where'd you girls
get those dresses?

21:00.374 --> 21:01.524
They're fabulous.

21:01.525 --> 21:03.693
- Mm.
- They're charming.

21:03.694 --> 21:05.695
Oh!

21:05.696 --> 21:06.913
Not so fast, mister.

21:06.914 --> 21:09.532
- Excuse you?
- Excuse me. Thank you, sir.

21:09.533 --> 21:11.617
- Not for you.
- Hello, it's Britta.

21:11.618 --> 21:13.369
Okay, I know a man
when I see one.

21:13.370 --> 21:15.487
Oh, lord, no!
