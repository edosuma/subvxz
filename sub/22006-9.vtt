WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:02.926
Previously, on SEAL Team...
Nobody wants to see you

00:02.970 --> 00:05.291
back with Alana more than I do.
Get your ass back home

00:05.330 --> 00:06.695
instead of lounging around
my living room all day.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.139
ALANA:
This is the only life we have,

00:08.170 --> 00:09.398
me and the kids.

00:09.440 --> 00:10.702
We're not gonna waste it
living with a ghost.

00:10.740 --> 00:12.799
DAVIS: Hey, you got a problem
with your accommodations?

00:12.840 --> 00:15.104
Do you know how many times
I've made a hammock on a C-130?

00:15.140 --> 00:16.346
If you are working
on an operation

00:16.380 --> 00:17.699
and you are not a
Tier One operator,

00:17.750 --> 00:18.774
you're a strap,
so buckle up

00:18.810 --> 00:21.540
back here with the rest
of us support personnel

00:21.580 --> 00:25.789
and don't make me kick your ass
up and down this aircraft.

00:25.820 --> 00:28.254
8:00 am. tomorrow.
Your team?

00:28.290 --> 00:29.780
Yes, my team.
And bring beer.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.492
I realize this isn't
what you Signed on for.

00:32.530 --> 00:35.090
This is exactly
what I signed on for.

00:35.130 --> 00:36.290
DAVIS:
You know when Sonny was

00:36.330 --> 00:38.764
at Team 4, he had that friend
that got blown up next to him

00:38.800 --> 00:40.495
on target; the guy ended up
getting medically retired?

00:40.540 --> 00:42.360
Yeah, Danny something.
Yeah, Danny Cooper.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.809
Hey, listen to me.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.502
What happened to Danny,
that shouldn't have happened.

00:46.540 --> 00:48.098
But it did happen,

00:48.140 --> 00:50.574
and there's nothing you
could've done about it.

00:50.610 --> 00:53.113
But what we can
do IS our Job.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.544
(thunder crashing)

01:00.190 --> 01:02.158
Sorry about the lightning.

01:02.190 --> 01:03.555
Suppose someone
thought an escape

01:03.590 --> 01:06.127
from behind the Iron Curtain
wasn't dramatic enough.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.094
No Iron Curtain anymore.

01:08.130 --> 01:09.597
Wish somebody had told me that

01:09.630 --> 01:11.598
before I decided
to join the CIA.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.360
English, Katya.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.561
We are American_now--
we speak English.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.339
(thunder crashing)

01:31.590 --> 01:32.682
Oh, my God!

01:32.720 --> 01:34.483
(rumbling thunder fades)

01:44.330 --> 01:45.592
(baby fussing)

01:45.630 --> 01:47.632
Hey.

01:47.670 --> 01:49.604
Man, this kid knows
what he wants.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.198
Yep.
(sighs)

01:51.240 --> 01:54.801
Don't worry about me--
I'm-I'm averting my eyes.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.876
(chuckles): Oh, please.
You've been through this. Twice.

01:56.910 --> 01:58.377
(sighs):
Yeah.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.549
Sorry we woke you.

02:00.580 --> 02:02.514
Figured I'd let Ray sleep.

02:02.550 --> 02:04.609
He hasn't been doing
much of that lately.

02:04.650 --> 02:05.810
Between this situation

02:05.850 --> 02:08.250
and how much you guys
have been working...

02:08.290 --> 02:10.349
Right. No, no. No, you didn't,
you didn't wake me.

02:10.390 --> 02:11.926
Trust me, I'm an early riser.

02:11.960 --> 02:15.157
(clears throat) Besides,
you're letting me live rent-free

02:15.200 --> 02:16.792
here on the couch.

02:16.830 --> 02:19.765
Well, you can't tell a Kurdish
girl to stop playing hostess.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.893
If my dad were here,
he'd be furious

02:21.940 --> 02:24.602
I'm not offering to cook
for you right now.

02:24.640 --> 02:26.938
(imitates father's accent): Of
course the man is hungry, Heja,

02:26.980 --> 02:30.177
but he's only too polite to ask.
Ah, I am not.

02:30.210 --> 02:32.349
Okay? And I loved your dad,
I swear-- he was the best.

02:32.380 --> 02:33.745
He liked you, too.

02:33.780 --> 02:34.815
Yeah.

02:34.850 --> 02:36.511
His son-in-law
on the other hand,

02:36.550 --> 02:38.814
the Black Irish-Italian Jew

02:38.850 --> 02:41.182
who never misses church.

02:42.860 --> 02:44.350
(baby fussing quietly)

02:44.390 --> 02:46.699
Ray tell you we're breaking in
a new kid today?

02:46.730 --> 02:48.459
Yeah. Name's, uh,

02:48.500 --> 02:50.468
Clay something?
Spenser. Clay Spenser.

02:50.500 --> 02:51.626
There, there you go.

02:51.670 --> 02:52.967
He say anything else about him?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.230
Just that he's the son
of a frogman,

02:55.270 --> 02:58.330
and you don't like him
'cause he reminds you of Nate.

02:58.370 --> 02:59.871
(crickets chirping softly)

02:59.910 --> 03:01.775
I do not not like him,
all right?

03:01.810 --> 03:04.608
Ijust like giving him
a hard time. Right?
Mm.

03:04.650 --> 03:06.641
Doesn't remind me of Nate.

03:08.550 --> 03:09.710
Except when he does.

03:14.290 --> 03:16.622
(birds chirping)

03:19.300 --> 03:20.494
(bottles clinking)

03:20.530 --> 03:22.395
Happy first day of school.

03:22.430 --> 03:24.591
You want me to
make breakfast?

03:24.630 --> 03:26.268
No, I'm fine.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.336
It's the most important meal
of the day, babe.

03:28.370 --> 03:30.736
(chuckles) Get back to sleep,
baby. I'll call you later, okay?

03:30.770 --> 03:32.328
Clay, it's okay.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.836
You know, it's okay
to be nervous, you know that?

03:33.880 --> 03:36.644
(chuckles softly)
Is that a fact?

03:36.680 --> 03:40.741
Yeah. You've only been
chasing this your entire life.

03:40.780 --> 03:41.747
You know...
(clears throat)

03:41.780 --> 03:44.010
when I was, uh,
when I was on my last deployment

03:44.050 --> 03:45.347
at my old command,

03:45.390 --> 03:46.584
I was, uh, an
assistant team leader,

03:46.620 --> 03:48.781
so I had six guys
who were all below me

03:48.820 --> 03:50.720
looking up to me
to keep us alive.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.921
That's the kind of situation
that'll make you nervous.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.690
Today, you know, the only thing
I got to worry about is just...

03:55.730 --> 03:58.995
keep my mouth shut, setting up
my equipment cage, and...

03:59.030 --> 04:00.497
probably getting my balls broke

04:00.540 --> 04:02.337
for bringing
the wrong kind of beer.

04:02.370 --> 04:03.837
See you went
with the Japanese stuff.

04:03.870 --> 04:05.758
Yeah.

04:07.310 --> 04:10.279
Well, they said no microbrews,
so, you know, of course, and,

04:10.310 --> 04:12.005
I thought about bringing
something really...

04:12.050 --> 04:14.348
real microbrew--
hoppy, nasty.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.587
But then I realized if I did,
they'd probably shoot me.

04:16.620 --> 04:17.689
(laughs)

04:17.720 --> 04:20.359
You know, it doesn't strike you
as kind of juvenile

04:20.390 --> 04:22.984
the new guy has to bring beer
for everyone else? It's like...

04:23.030 --> 04:26.454
it's like a fraternity
initiation or something.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.765
(laughs) I guess it kind of is
like a fraternity initiation.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.536
Right, okay.

04:32.570 --> 04:34.299
(sighs):
Um...

04:34.340 --> 04:36.467
just...

04:36.510 --> 04:38.865
just... be safe.

04:38.910 --> 04:40.571
You know me.

04:45.380 --> 04:46.677
Bye.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.709
Later.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.651
Okay, so what
about weapons?

04:54.690 --> 04:56.920
Uh, yeah, I figure I'm
gonna need a few, huh?

04:56.960 --> 04:58.382
Any in particular?

04:58.430 --> 05:00.091
I'm sorry, I'm
not really sure.

05:00.130 --> 05:02.018
Okay, this is how this works.

05:02.060 --> 05:05.621
You tell me what _
to get for you, I get It.

05:05.670 --> 05:07.490
Just like that?

05:07.540 --> 05:08.893
Why not?
(chuckles)

05:08.940 --> 05:10.066
Wait, so, are-are you saying
that I can just, like,

05:10.110 --> 05:11.702
put together a little Christmas
list, anything I want,

05:11.740 --> 05:12.570
and you're gonna
get it for me?

05:12.610 --> 05:14.498
You might even say
that's part of my job.

05:14.540 --> 05:17.043
Wow. You know how much crap
I would've got at Team 3

05:17.080 --> 05:19.048
ifI would even ask for
an extra flashlight?

05:19.080 --> 05:21.969
Well, let's both thank our luclq
stars that we're not at Team 3.

05:22.020 --> 05:24.079
Team room, 15.

05:25.420 --> 05:26.614
Hey, just so I can...

05:26.660 --> 05:28.810
just so I can get
my head right, is this...

05:28.860 --> 05:30.828
is this gonna be some kind
of rookie hazing thing,

05:30.860 --> 05:31.929
or did we catch a spin?

05:31.960 --> 05:33.552
Can't we do both?

05:34.960 --> 05:36.825
15 minutes.

05:44.170 --> 05:45.637
Oh, yeah.

05:47.110 --> 05:48.998
Welcome to DEVGRU.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.371
(chuckles softly)

05:55.720 --> 05:57.847
(door closes)

06:00.590 --> 06:02.558
Oh-ho! Look who's
nice and early, huh?

06:02.590 --> 06:03.625
Oh. And he brings

06:03.660 --> 06:04.854
the wrong beer--
the import stuff.

06:04.890 --> 06:06.551
You're off to a good start.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.488
_ _On time is _
five minutes late, right?

06:08.530 --> 06:10.623
You calling us late?
(chuckles)

06:10.670 --> 06:11.694
No, H was just...
JASON: Okay, okay,

06:11.730 --> 06:12.697
okay, the first time that

06:12.740 --> 06:15.163
the new guy tries to show up his
new teammates,

06:15.200 --> 06:16.565
I say that's a case of beer,
right?

06:16.610 --> 06:17.736
Case of beer.
Case of beer.

06:17.770 --> 06:19.101
Case of beer.
Oh, God.

06:19.140 --> 06:21.802
Where you going?
Get back. Back of the bus.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.705
Back of the bus.
Come on, man.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.502
Come on.
Back of the bus, kid.

06:25.550 --> 06:26.517
It begins.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.143
All right.
Who's Mr. Personality?

06:30.190 --> 06:32.886
MANDY:
Dr. Dmitri Alexeivich Zimov.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.150
Until yesterday,
he was one of the men

06:35.190 --> 06:38.159
in charge of Russia's
cyberwarfare program,

06:38.190 --> 06:40.158
and the Agency's best
clandestine source

06:40.200 --> 06:41.656
on Russian efforts

06:41.700 --> 06:43.520
to hack into our
critical infrastructure.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.525
What happened yesterday?

06:44.570 --> 06:46.868
He attempted to defect
to the United States.

06:46.900 --> 06:47.730
You don't say.

06:47.770 --> 06:50.159
We flew him and his wife

06:50.210 --> 06:52.166
in a four-seater
out of Southern Siberia.

06:52.210 --> 06:54.178
They were supposed
to follow the Chinese border

06:54.210 --> 06:56.030
all the way down
into Afghanistan,

06:56.080 --> 06:58.742
got into a lightning storm
above the Pamir Mountains,

06:58.780 --> 07:00.179
dropped off radar.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.541
Satellite pass this morning
found what we believe

07:02.590 --> 07:04.842
is the debris field, here.

07:06.090 --> 07:06.954
That's China.

07:06.990 --> 07:07.979
(mock exclaiming, gasping)

07:08.020 --> 07:09.681
First time new guy
says something

07:09.730 --> 07:10.856
in a briefing...
Case of beer!

07:10.890 --> 07:11.879
OTHERS:
Another case of beer.

07:11.930 --> 07:12.749
Good stuff.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.892
Not that stuff.
Yeah.

07:13.930 --> 07:15.488
MANDY:
Mr. Spenser,

07:15.530 --> 07:18.169
it's nice to have you
back with us-- and yes,

07:18.200 --> 07:21.636
the crash site is on the Chinese
face of the Wakhan Corridor.

07:21.670 --> 07:23.467
ERIC: Good news is:
it puts our people

07:23.510 --> 07:25.865
just ten kilometers east
of the Afghan border.

07:25.910 --> 07:27.639
Bad news:
it also puts them

07:27.680 --> 07:30.547
at an elevation
of approximately 12,000 feet

07:30.580 --> 07:31.774
inside a country
with a nuclear arsenal

07:31.810 --> 07:32.879
and the largest
standing army

07:32.920 --> 07:34.911
in the history
of the planet.

07:34.950 --> 07:36.349
We're going in
to get the survivors out.

07:36.380 --> 07:38.780
W-Wait, we're positive
there are survivors?
Satellite photos

07:38.820 --> 07:41.152
show movement at the crash site.
Okay, wait a second, hold on.

07:41.190 --> 07:44.648
I mean, even if they walked away
from a crash site like that,

07:44.690 --> 07:46.749
on that rough terrain,
how are they gonna stay alive?

07:46.800 --> 07:47.789
What, they have training?

07:47.830 --> 07:49.127
Our officer and the pilot

07:49.160 --> 07:50.866
both went through
survival school.

07:50.900 --> 07:53.039
What about the doc?
Doc and his wife are hikers.

07:53.070 --> 07:54.935
They kept a vacation home
at the Altai Mountains.

07:54.970 --> 07:57.507
God, they must want
this guy an awful lot

07:57.540 --> 07:59.007
for us to travel
all the way to China.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.769
You can say that again.
Right?

08:00.810 --> 08:02.539
Russians, they know he's gone?

08:02.580 --> 08:03.945
Before he left,
Dr. Zimov

08:03.980 --> 08:05.709
wrote a letter_
to hIS old superwsor

08:05.750 --> 08:08.275
telling him that he'd been
a CIA asset going on five years.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.641
SONNY:
One way to prevent yourself
getting cold feet defecting

08:10.690 --> 08:14.888
is to fix it so you will
be executed if you return.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.114
Bosses want
what's inside his head.
Yep.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.822
Plus, they want to keep the
Russians from getting him back.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.266
So we, uh,
get some ATVs in here?

08:32.310 --> 08:34.278
Oh, no, no, no. There's
no time for ground infil.

08:34.310 --> 08:36.744
We're gonna have to HAHO in.
We got to get to the crash site,

08:36.780 --> 08:38.270
pick up the survivors' trail,
run 'em down.

08:38.310 --> 08:40.141
Get everybody across the
border into Afghanistan

08:40.180 --> 08:42.239
before they know that
we are even there.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.646
RAY: Well, you think, uh,
we'll be able to do all that

08:44.690 --> 08:46.180
before the Chinese
find the wreck?
Well, our chances

08:46.220 --> 08:48.211
are a lot better
the sooner we get on the ground.

08:48.260 --> 08:49.887
ERIC: Yeah, shouldn't be long
till wheels up.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.227
Just heard that
our Pentagon liaison

08:51.260 --> 08:52.898
has made it
through gate security.

08:52.930 --> 08:53.954
Whoa.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.649
We're bringing a liaison?
What?

08:57.330 --> 08:59.161
could go wrong
in a whole lot of ways

08:59.200 --> 09:01.293
that'd likely lead
to World War III.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.807
Reckon that the Pentagon

09:02.840 --> 09:04.569
would like to avoid
that kind of outcome.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.828
So naive.
Okay, let me get
this straight.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.303
So, liaison's gonna stay
with TOC, comms on,

09:09.340 --> 09:10.409
just so we don't, what,

09:10.450 --> 09:13.840
inadvertently start
World War III with the Chinese?

09:13.880 --> 09:16.178
Over comms that'll be in and out
anyway because of the mountains.

09:16.220 --> 09:18.040
Hey, did you pack us
the new sat antenna?
(phone rings)

09:18.090 --> 09:19.580
Are you trying
to hurt my feelings?

09:19.620 --> 09:20.848
Blackburn.

09:20.890 --> 09:22.209
Yes, sir.

09:22.260 --> 09:23.659
We're on our way.

09:24.930 --> 09:26.693
Liaison's gonna meet us
at the airfield.

09:26.730 --> 09:28.049
We're good to go.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.193
SONNY: All right, new guy
owes us a case of beer

09:30.230 --> 09:32.994
first time on an aircraft
With us. Cool?
Bam!

09:33.040 --> 09:34.337
Abu Samir op doesn't count?
I mean, I boarded

09:34.370 --> 09:37.009
a plane on that one, too, yeah?
Oh-ho!

09:37.040 --> 09:38.337
JASON: Oh, got you, Sonny. Oh.
(laughter, whooping)

09:38.370 --> 09:41.100
We were on a C-130
on the Abu Samir op,

09:41.140 --> 09:43.802
disguised
as a humanitarian mission.

09:43.850 --> 09:44.908
So?

09:44.950 --> 09:46.815
So... new guy owes
a case of beer

09:46.850 --> 09:48.875
every time he boards
a new plane with us.

09:48.920 --> 09:49.887
Boom!
Boom!

09:49.920 --> 09:51.217
I've been on a C-17 before.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.888
Not as a member of this team.

09:52.920 --> 09:53.887
JASON: First time
he questions

09:53.920 --> 09:56.184
a 3-IC, case of beer.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.222
CLAY: This is, uh, this is
getting a little expensive here.

09:58.260 --> 10:00.251
How many cases do we have?
That's a dozen, I'd say.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.894
Oh! New guy owes another case of
beer first time he loses count.

10:02.930 --> 10:04.363
Wow! That's
a baker's dozen.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.322
You know what? We don't
make the rules, buddy.

10:06.370 --> 10:08.292
Just welcome to the show,
little boy.

10:08.340 --> 10:10.900
Hey, hey, hey,
hey. Hold on.

10:10.940 --> 10:13.033
(indistinct chatter)

10:14.380 --> 10:17.247
(line ringing)

10:17.280 --> 10:19.714
VOICE MAIL: Hey. It's Danny.
Try me on text.

10:19.750 --> 10:20.910
(line beeps)

10:20.950 --> 10:24.989
Hey, Danny.
It's, uh, Sonny Quinn again.

10:25.020 --> 10:28.979
_ Um... I-I don't know
if you got my last message.

10:29.020 --> 10:33.354
I know how we all can get busy
and... not call back.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.924
Um...

10:37.230 --> 10:39.790
I'm just checking on you, man.
Just, uh...

10:39.840 --> 10:41.933
seeing how civilian life
is for you,

10:41.970 --> 10:43.938
(chuckles):
you know, 'cause...

10:43.970 --> 10:47.872
I guess we're all gonna end up
there anyway, ain't that right?

10:47.910 --> 10:49.036
Yeah.

10:50.310 --> 10:52.847
Just call me when you can, man.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.269
Thinking about you.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.345
(phone beeps off)

11:00.420 --> 11:02.115
(gate rattles, Sonny grunts)

11:05.160 --> 11:06.286
(low conversations)

11:06.330 --> 11:08.252
ERIC:
Master Chief Hayes.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.461
This is Pentagon liaison,
Paul Marberry.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.762
Marberry, okay.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.861
(clicks tongue)

11:17.910 --> 11:18.968
What's up? You
don't have a problem

11:19.010 --> 11:20.307
me making a hammock
this time?

11:20.340 --> 11:21.272
Well, you're not
a strap anymore.

11:21.310 --> 11:24.177
I wasn't a strap on
the Samir op, either.

11:24.210 --> 11:26.041
I'm not having this conversation
with you again.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.945
And you know you're gonna
owe another case of beer

11:27.980 --> 11:29.914
the first time you make yourself
a hammock. (clicks tongue)

11:29.950 --> 11:31.315
Maybe they'll forget.

11:31.350 --> 11:32.886
Yeah, I won't
hold my breath.

11:32.920 --> 11:33.909
Hey, Spense.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.188
It's another case of beer

11:35.220 --> 11:36.312
first time in a hammock.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.679
Just saying.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.325
You ever, uh,
heard from Danny?

11:44.370 --> 11:45.860
Danny Cooper?
Yeah.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.198
You were working Team 2,

11:48.240 --> 11:49.764
he was Team 4.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.437
It seemed like you guys were
pretty tight back then.

11:51.470 --> 11:53.176
Yeah, no, we were
for a while.
Yeah?

11:53.210 --> 11:54.802
Till he went and
tried to kiss me.
Ooh.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.877
Sly dog.
He never told me that.

11:57.910 --> 12:00.344
Probably was a little
embarrassed getting turned down.

12:00.380 --> 12:02.268
Or on the other hand,
maybe he just thought

12:02.320 --> 12:04.208
it was none of your business.
(Sonny laughs)

12:04.250 --> 12:07.048
SONNY:
You ever hear from him
after he got hurt?

12:07.090 --> 12:08.114
No. I mean, not really.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.378
You know, I went and, I visited
him a couple times

12:10.430 --> 12:12.523
in the hospital after they
brought him back from Germany.

12:12.560 --> 12:15.154
Yeah.

12:15.200 --> 12:19.068
That's where he was when
I finished Green Team, and...

12:19.100 --> 12:22.729
kept meaning to go
and see him, but...

12:25.410 --> 12:27.378
I mean, you know
how our schedule is.

12:27.410 --> 12:28.536
Yeah, no.

12:28.580 --> 12:31.401
You don't have to tell me.
(clears throat)

12:40.020 --> 12:42.011
(door alarm beeping)

12:48.600 --> 12:51.296
SONNY:
First time you jump with us,
that's a case of beer.

12:51.330 --> 12:52.763
JASON:
Case of beer!

13:16.960 --> 13:18.951
(footsteps)

13:34.310 --> 13:36.301
(dog panting)

13:51.360 --> 13:53.590
Let's see.

13:53.630 --> 13:55.450
All right.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.060
So we landed here,
now we're here.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.419
Means the wreck's a
klick and a half east.

13:59.470 --> 14:01.062
Just over that ridge.
Well, terrain like this,

14:01.100 --> 14:02.499
we're lucky we get in
a klick per hour.

14:02.540 --> 14:03.302
We got to get going.

14:03.340 --> 14:06.059
Sonny, rear security.
Roger that.

14:06.110 --> 14:08.328
Ray, take point.
Clay boy,

14:08.380 --> 14:10.507
form on me. Let's go.

14:26.330 --> 14:28.992
CLAY:
Visual on crash site, standby.

14:41.140 --> 14:42.402
Hey, we've got a problem.

14:42.440 --> 14:43.998
We got another team
on the ground.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.225
Russians.

14:59.260 --> 15:00.955
You sure, boss?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.524
JASON:
Son of a bitch.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.118
They beat us here.

15:11.710 --> 15:13.268
(man singing Islamic call
to prayer)

15:13.310 --> 15:14.675
Alpha Group?
You're certain?

15:14.710 --> 15:16.371
JASON (over comms):
Yeah, I'm certain.

15:16.410 --> 15:18.674
They look like us
and they move like us.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.246
As far as I know,
there's only one

15:20.280 --> 15:22.145
Tier One Russian unit,
that's Alpha.

15:22.180 --> 15:23.215
Yeah, me, too.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.387
Uh, Lieutenant Commander.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.445
You will remind your team
that discretion

15:26.490 --> 15:28.117
is of the absolute utmost...

15:28.160 --> 15:31.425
Yes, sir?
Apologies not necessary, sir.

15:31.460 --> 15:34.054
Bravo 1,

15:34.100 --> 15:35.249
we're gonna need
to give them a wide berth.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.358
Understood.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.292
Alpha Group?

15:39.330 --> 15:41.161
It's_ Russian
SpeCIal Forces.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.737
I thought that was Spetsnaz.
DAVIS: It is.

15:43.770 --> 15:46.432
Look, Spetsnaz covers a lot
of different units.

15:46.470 --> 15:47.698
Alpha is the best of the best.

15:47.740 --> 15:50.049
It has been since the
KGB hit squad days.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.674
Yes, sir, we think it's a unit
called Alpha Group.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.540
Alpha, that's right, sir.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.582
It's their equivalent of
our Tier One commandos.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.417
Yes, sir.
They know not to engage.

16:01.220 --> 16:03.222
Spetsnaz covers
lots of things, sir.

16:03.260 --> 16:04.682
Alpha's their best of the best.

16:04.730 --> 16:08.097
It's been that way since
the KGB hit squad days.

16:12.630 --> 16:14.234
JASON:
As soon as they're gone,

16:14.270 --> 16:15.294
we'll move in.

16:15.340 --> 16:16.739
CLAY (over comms):
If Alpha's as good as they say,

16:16.770 --> 16:18.237
you don't think they might
get out of sight,

16:18.270 --> 16:19.760
hole up somewhere
and watch their backs?

16:19.810 --> 16:20.834
RAY (over comms):
They're not expecting a tail.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.348
Thei_r main_conc_ern is the
Chinese, just like ours.

16:23.380 --> 16:25.075
Russians aren't supposed
to be here, either.

16:25.110 --> 16:27.419
That just sounds like
we're assuming an awful lot.

16:27.450 --> 16:29.213
SONNY (over comms):
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.514
The young buck owes us another
case of beer

16:31.550 --> 16:33.609
for questioning
the tactical judgment

16:33.660 --> 16:35.389
of his tactical betters.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.170
ERIC (over comms):
Bravo 1, this is TOC.

16:58.210 --> 17:00.349
Sitrep, any casualties?

17:00.380 --> 17:02.371
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

17:02.420 --> 17:04.149
Got two, the pilot
and the handler.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.543
There's no sign of
the wife or the asset.

17:05.590 --> 17:07.114
SONNY:
Got blood back here.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.388
There's blood in the back.

17:08.420 --> 17:09.648
SONNY:
Blood trailing
from the plane.

17:09.690 --> 17:10.759
Hold on, TOC.

17:10.790 --> 17:11.722
It's heading northwest.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.625
You figure Doc and his wife

17:13.660 --> 17:15.457
got a little banged up
when they hit.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.718
Might explain the blood
in the back.
Yeah.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.637
SONNY:
The Russians, they came
in from the north.

17:20.670 --> 17:23.730
Picked up on the trail
of Doc and his wife.

17:23.770 --> 17:26.261
And they headed northwest.

17:26.310 --> 17:27.504
CLAY:
Plane survival kit's gone.

17:27.540 --> 17:29.337
Figure the doc took it.

17:29.380 --> 17:30.642
Looks like the Russians
took the electronics,

17:30.680 --> 17:32.079
whatever documents
they could ﬁnd.

17:32.110 --> 17:33.418
Left the luggage.

17:33.450 --> 17:35.042
We going after them?

17:37.550 --> 17:38.812
Just saying, every
second we stand here,

17:38.850 --> 17:39.748
their head start's
getting bigger.

17:39.790 --> 17:42.281
Figure what-- they got
20 minutes on us?

17:42.320 --> 17:43.355
So?

17:43.390 --> 17:46.188
Well, so, Doc and his wife
have 20 hours on them.

17:46.230 --> 17:48.357
We can catch up to them before
they catch up to our people.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.698
Okay. Then what?
I'm sorry?

17:50.730 --> 17:52.618
JASON:
Then what? What do we do
after we catch them?

17:52.670 --> 17:53.830
Are we gonna ask the
Russians really kindly

17:53.870 --> 17:55.167
if we can get
the doc back?

17:55.200 --> 17:56.269
We can't engage, Spenser.

17:56.300 --> 17:58.268
What we have to do is

17:58.310 --> 17:59.800
we gotta get
in front of them.

17:59.840 --> 18:00.772
How do we do that?

18:00.810 --> 18:02.630
They don't have a dog.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.568
(Cerberus panting)

18:04.610 --> 18:06.441
(whines quietly)

18:06.480 --> 18:08.710
Alpha wants to find
the doc and his wife,

18:08.750 --> 18:10.581
they got no choice
but to get close enough

18:10.620 --> 18:11.814
to step on 'em.

18:11.850 --> 18:13.681
Means they gotta follow
their windy-ass trail.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.654
All we gotta do is
get Cerberus downwind.

18:15.690 --> 18:17.453
Means we go straight up,

18:17.490 --> 18:19.424
wait for the dog
to catch a scent.

18:19.460 --> 18:21.325
Even with the dog, we can't
cover the whole mountain.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.260
We don't have to.
We know where they're going.

18:23.300 --> 18:25.120
RAY: He's got a compass
from the survival kit.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.398
JASON: The guy's not
gonna know where he is.

18:26.430 --> 18:28.261
He's gonna head west,
towards Afghanistan.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.528
And the only way through
is the Wakhjir Pass.

18:29.570 --> 18:30.662
(claps hands)
Okay, look, hey, we
got to get a move on.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.462
We gotta get up on that ridge.
Tell you what, Brock,

18:32.510 --> 18:33.875
get Cerberus a scent,
will you?

18:33.910 --> 18:36.128
I'll toss a thermite grenade,
melt it all down.

18:36.180 --> 18:37.477
No, no, no, no,
we can't do that.

18:37.510 --> 18:39.205
We're not gonna leave
any kind of evidence here.

18:39.250 --> 18:41.616
It's best that the Chinese
find the wreckage the way it is.

18:41.650 --> 18:43.618
BROCK:
Yeah, go find it.

18:43.650 --> 18:45.709
Go find it.
JASON:
Okay, let's go.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.613
BROCK (quietly):
Go get 'em, go get 'em.

19:15.950 --> 19:18.316
(whines quietly)

19:18.350 --> 19:19.578
BROCK (over comms):
He's got it.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.299
Dmitri, Katya.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.948
Dmitri.

19:43.980 --> 19:46.608
DMITRI:
I have a gun.

19:46.650 --> 19:48.277
JASON:
Okay.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.947
And you can hold onto that
if you feel more comfortable.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.413
Listen, we're Americans.

19:51.450 --> 19:53.452
We're._.. we're here
to bring you out.

19:53.490 --> 19:55.310
DMITRI: How do I know
you're not lying?

19:55.360 --> 19:56.987
About which part?

19:57.020 --> 19:59.420
If you are Russian, you might
say you are American

19:59.460 --> 20:02.293
so you can get close
to take me alive.

20:02.330 --> 20:03.490
_ SONNY:
Listen up, Drago.

20:03.530 --> 20:04.963
I got a thermite grenade

20:05.000 --> 20:06.820
that burns at 4,000 degrees

20:06.870 --> 20:08.963
and will melt your body
like a candlestick.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.434
So you keep acting
like a jerk,

20:11.470 --> 20:12.960
and I'm fixin' to
throw one your way.

20:13.010 --> 20:14.534
JASON: Listen, Dr. Zimov,
we don't have a lot of time.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.969
There are Russian special forces
on the ground.

20:22.950 --> 20:24.918
CLAY: From what we saw
at the crash site,

20:24.950 --> 20:27.418
it looks like one of you
might be injured.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.712
We got a medic out here
and some first-aid supplies,

20:29.760 --> 20:31.489
so the sooner
you let us in there,

20:31.530 --> 20:32.827
the sooner we can
get to work on you,

20:32.860 --> 20:35.420
or get you to a surgical
hospital in Kandahar

20:35.460 --> 20:36.757
if your condition requires.

20:47.940 --> 20:49.601
Come on out.

20:52.080 --> 20:55.516
Which one of you
is medic?

20:55.550 --> 20:56.642
I'm a medic, right here.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.284
You're medic?
Yeah.

20:59.950 --> 21:02.987
Help my wife, please.
All right.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.522
What do you say we just
take that out of your hand

21:06.560 --> 21:07.788
right now, okay?

21:07.830 --> 21:10.628
All right.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.524
Help my wife, please.

21:14.100 --> 21:17.638
Help my wife,
please.

21:17.670 --> 21:18.830
Katya...

21:18.870 --> 21:21.998
JASON:
All right. Okay.

21:22.040 --> 21:24.543
(Katya groaning)

21:24.580 --> 21:25.740
You speak any English?
(groaning)

21:25.780 --> 21:27.577
You speak any English?

21:27.620 --> 21:29.417
You allergic
to any medications?

21:29.450 --> 21:32.487
Doc, is she allergic
to morphine?

21:32.520 --> 21:33.885
No, I don't think so.
Morphine.

21:37.590 --> 21:38.682
(speaks Russian)

21:39.690 --> 21:41.794
(groans)
Okay.

21:41.830 --> 21:44.060
All right, just rest.
You're gonna be all right.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.468
Should never have
brought her here.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.468
Should never have gotten
involved with you people.

21:49.500 --> 21:50.660
Yeah, well, you know what,
you did.

21:50.710 --> 21:53.099
Give us some space,

21:53.140 --> 21:54.072
so we can work--
do you understand?

21:54.110 --> 21:56.374
All right? The sooner we get
her stabilized,

21:56.410 --> 21:57.502
the sooner we can move you.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.472
Okay.
Staple gun.

21:59.510 --> 22:00.738
Staple.

22:05.790 --> 22:08.554
MANDY: Bravo 1, be advised,
eyes are on the border.

22:08.590 --> 22:10.057
Shows Chinese infantry
moving in

22:10.090 --> 22:11.819
to block off the Wakhjir Pass.

22:11.860 --> 22:15.421
Estimated to be at least
battalion strength. 700 men.

22:15.460 --> 22:18.691
(whispering): You got to be
kidding me. 700-- geez. 700?

22:18.730 --> 22:19.890
Give or take.

22:19.930 --> 22:21.067
Are you telling me
they found the plane?

22:21.100 --> 22:22.431
No, not yet.

22:22.470 --> 22:23.732
So far, all they know

22:23.770 --> 22:25.658
is the general location
where it went down.

22:25.710 --> 22:27.473
They're bringing in the infantry
to block off the area

22:27.510 --> 22:28.977
while they search.

22:29.010 --> 22:30.978
ERIC: Bottom line,
with the pass blocked,

22:31.010 --> 22:32.875
you're gonna have to find
an alternate exfil route.

22:32.910 --> 22:34.571
Copy that.
We'll take the goat trails out.

22:34.620 --> 22:36.770
Copy, Bravo 1. How soon
till you're ready to travel?

22:36.820 --> 22:38.685
Ten minutes.
Be adVIsed, you got about

22:38.720 --> 22:40.085
an hour left till sunrise.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.815
Copy that.
We're on the move.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.157
It's gonna be a pain in the ass

22:43.190 --> 22:44.589
carrying that litter
up and over.

22:44.630 --> 22:45.927
Thread the needle
through some goat trail,

22:45.960 --> 22:47.052
what, two meters wide?

22:47.090 --> 22:48.421
Don't have a choice, Ray.

22:48.460 --> 22:49.552
Where's the doc?

22:49.600 --> 22:50.589
What do you mean,
where's the doc?

22:50.630 --> 22:51.927
Anybody got eyes
on the doc?

22:51.970 --> 22:54.029
Anybody got eyes on the doc?

22:54.070 --> 22:57.130
TRENT: Negative. We thought
he was with you. Over.

23:06.180 --> 23:09.445
All right, look, I told the doc
that Alpha was on his trail,

23:09.480 --> 23:11.186
so what he's probably gonna do
is backtrack, turn himself in.
They take him home to get

23:11.220 --> 23:15.156
interrogated and executed, she
gets to live happily ever after.
SONNY: I'll go get him.

23:15.190 --> 23:16.817
What do you mean you'll go?
Alone?

23:16.860 --> 23:18.020
Uh, got my girlfriend, here.

23:18.060 --> 23:19.584
JASON: Uh-uh.
I've seen you climb hills,

23:19.630 --> 23:21.154
and that's_a disaster.
You're not gomg anywhere.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.418
I'll take the kid, I'll take
Spenser. Don't mess this up.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.119
Wait, hold on.
Listen, get her
on the litter

23:25.170 --> 23:26.421
and have her ready to go
when we come back.

23:26.470 --> 23:28.165
Jace.
What? We got to get these people

23:28.200 --> 23:29.861
across the_ border
before sunrise, okay?

23:29.900 --> 23:31.162
We need the fast movers. Me
and him, we're the fast movers.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.529
Okay, first of all, kiss my ass.

23:32.570 --> 23:33.332
Yeah.
Second of all,

23:33.370 --> 23:34.974
sunrise is in what,
30 minutes?

23:35.010 --> 23:36.898
Carl Lewis couldn't get us
across that border by then.

23:36.940 --> 23:38.771
We'll cross that bridge
when we get to it. Let's go.

23:38.810 --> 23:39.845
Are you up for
a little exercise?

23:39.880 --> 23:41.177
Missed my spin class
this morning.

23:41.220 --> 23:44.144
All right,
let's do this.

23:50.060 --> 23:52.051
(birds calling)

23:54.860 --> 23:56.054
Come on, let's go.

23:56.100 --> 23:57.590
Get your scope up.
What do you see?

24:07.240 --> 24:09.504
CLAY:
No sign of the doc.

24:09.540 --> 24:11.246
Good news: no sign of Alpha,
either.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.009
I don't know if
that is good news.

24:13.050 --> 24:15.211
We don't see 'em, we don't
know where they are, right?

24:15.250 --> 24:18.708
(branches snapping)
(indistinct talking)

24:25.760 --> 24:27.250
DMITRI: What did she ever do
but respect my work?

24:27.290 --> 24:28.689
JASON :
Doc. Doc?

24:28.730 --> 24:30.891
DMITRI:
Nothing. Nothing.

24:30.930 --> 24:33.125
Come on, Doc, let's go.
All she did was respect my work,
that's all.

24:35.570 --> 24:37.094
She doesn't deserve this.
JASON: No one does. Okay, look.

24:37.140 --> 24:38.107
We're running out of time here.

24:38.140 --> 24:39.767
We got to get you out of here.
Let's go, Doc.

24:39.810 --> 24:40.879
Come on.
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 2.

24:40.910 --> 24:42.036
Watch him.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.945
All right?
Bravo 2, this is Bravo 1.

24:43.980 --> 24:45.140
We got the doc.

24:45.180 --> 24:46.147
RAY:
Glad to hear it.

24:46.180 --> 24:49.616
Okay, sun's up.
We're not gonna make the border.

24:49.650 --> 24:51.083
Yeah, it's a good thing
I'm sitting down.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.212
JASON: It's too risky
to move in daylight,

24:52.250 --> 24:53.285
so we're gonna hunker down.

24:53.320 --> 24:54.287
(helicopter blades whirring)

24:54.320 --> 24:55.912
And the Chinese agree.

24:55.960 --> 24:59.054
Yeah, they do.

24:59.090 --> 25:01.923
Figure we'll rendezvous
back here after sundown,

25:01.960 --> 25:04.064
form up, head for the border
all together?

25:04.100 --> 25:05.727
Sounds like a plan. 1, out.

25:05.770 --> 25:07.021
Copy that.

25:08.600 --> 25:09.999
What about Alpha?
What about Alpha?

25:10.040 --> 25:11.905
What do you think
they're gonna do?

25:11.940 --> 25:13.874
They're gonna hunker
down just like us.

25:13.910 --> 25:15.537
They don't want
to get caught.

25:15.580 --> 25:17.229
Right? That is
if they're in country.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.145
You think they lit out?

25:19.180 --> 25:20.818
I don't know, what do you think?

25:20.850 --> 25:22.078
No.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.088
Okay, tell you what. Why don't
you go set up watch position.

25:24.120 --> 25:25.246
I got the doc.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.049
Let's go.

25:29.090 --> 25:30.921
Come on, get up.
We got to go.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.029
(whimpers)

25:32.060 --> 25:34.858
What do you mean
they're staying put?

25:34.900 --> 25:36.697
Until when?

25:36.730 --> 25:38.664
Until the sun goes back down.
(scoffs)

25:38.700 --> 25:40.930
Because?
ERIC: 'Cause the Chinese
infantry

25:40.970 --> 25:42.164
doesn't have night vision.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.134
Soon as those surveillance birds
spot that plane,

25:44.170 --> 25:45.102
most of the 700 troops

25:45.140 --> 25:47.165
that the Chinese are moving up
to Wakhjir Pass

25:47.210 --> 25:49.132
are gonna start
climbing up towards it.

25:49.180 --> 25:51.307
That's if they're not
moving there already!

25:51.350 --> 25:52.942
Now what happens if they
come across our team

25:52.980 --> 25:54.140
before the sun goes down?

25:57.220 --> 26:00.951
I trust my men's ability
to avoid detection.

26:00.990 --> 26:02.981
Oh, well, that's...

26:03.020 --> 26:04.726
Okay. You know what?

26:04.760 --> 26:06.853
You can help me explain that
to Washington.

26:06.890 --> 26:09.222
Here. That's for you.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.608
Blackburn's taking some heat.

26:20.640 --> 26:22.278
DAVIS: Blackburn
is a mid-level officer.

26:22.310 --> 26:23.607
Job is to take the heat,

26:23.650 --> 26:24.742
and let the door kickers
underneath him

26:24.780 --> 26:26.202
focus on the life
and death.

26:26.250 --> 26:28.013
Figures, the new guy's first op

26:28.050 --> 26:30.109
_would turn into
a daylight escape and evade.

26:30.150 --> 26:31.947
Yeah, so much for easing him in.

26:34.820 --> 26:36.617
JASON:
You ought to get some sleep.

26:36.660 --> 26:38.958
CLAY: I can go one day in the
field without racking out.

26:38.990 --> 26:41.299
JASON: Our mission was_ to
come in, get out by sunrise.

26:41.330 --> 26:43.969
That didn't happen.
You saw that, right?

26:44.000 --> 26:45.729
Sleep while you can.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.328
Who's gonna make sure
he doesn't rabbit again

26:47.370 --> 26:49.031
while you're
standing watch?

26:49.070 --> 26:50.901
Oh, don't worry about that guy.
He's out cold.

26:50.940 --> 26:52.635
He's been so pumped up
on adrenaline

26:52.670 --> 26:54.729
for the past two days,
he's not going anywhere

26:54.780 --> 26:56.372
till we pry his eyes open.

26:59.350 --> 27:02.171
So I'm hearing that you just
moved in with a new girl.

27:02.220 --> 27:05.087
Wow, Master Chief Seaver's
got a big mouth.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.781
I mean, you can
call him Adam now.

27:06.820 --> 27:08.651
You're not on
Green Team anymore.

27:08.690 --> 27:11.056
Mm, well, that's gonna take
some getting used to.

27:11.090 --> 27:13.923
He used to run with your old man
back in the day, didn't he?

27:13.960 --> 27:15.154
(sniffs)

27:17.900 --> 27:19.162
We didn't move in together.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.168
She kept her old place.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.667
She's just staying at
my house most nights.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.769
She's staying every night
in your place,

27:25.810 --> 27:28.370
so technically,
you are living together.

27:28.410 --> 27:30.332
If you want to make sure
she'll be notified

27:30.380 --> 27:32.245
if you get killed
or jacked up,

27:32.280 --> 27:36.011
she's got to be
your legal next of kin.

27:36.050 --> 27:39.178
Yeah, my whole life,
I pictured how my first day

27:39.220 --> 27:41.882
as a DEVGRU operator might go.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.184
Never once did I imagine
my team leader

27:44.230 --> 27:46.323
would be sitting here
playing Dr. Phil.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.396
What I care about
are the guys on my team.

27:49.430 --> 27:52.228
And they cannot afford
to be distracted.

27:52.270 --> 27:55.068
Margin of error is zero.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.271
And to be honest with you,
you know what?

28:01.310 --> 28:06.247
Technically, this is your
second day as a DEVGRU operator.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.713
Another case of beer?

28:07.750 --> 28:09.411
No, that would be
a bottle of tequila.

28:09.450 --> 28:11.384
Coming my way.
Blanco.

28:11.420 --> 28:13.217
(laughs)

28:13.250 --> 28:15.810
(helicopter passes overhead)

28:18.060 --> 28:19.982
Bravo 2, this is Bravo 4.

28:20.030 --> 28:22.851
Go for 2.
Chinese ground control
has moved off to the north.

28:22.900 --> 28:23.719
We're clear.
Copy that.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.863
Them passes are getting
closer together.

28:25.900 --> 28:29.859
Yeah, narrowing
their search area.

28:29.900 --> 28:32.004
SONNY: How many
Chinese troops are...

28:32.040 --> 28:34.736
climbing up,
heading towards us?

28:34.780 --> 28:36.998
Few hundred, at least.

28:39.110 --> 28:41.943
How 'bout that doctor, huh?

28:41.980 --> 28:46.417
Had to run off,
make himself feel like a hero.

28:46.450 --> 28:48.509
Leave the rest of us here
holding his bag.

28:48.560 --> 28:52.951
He just had to stay put,
let himself be rescued;

28:55.300 --> 28:56.949
Guy puts his wife
in harm's way.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.366
I guess he feels like he ought
to be the one to get her out.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.288
Idiot.

29:01.340 --> 29:04.229
(Katya groans softly)

29:04.270 --> 29:05.999
You doing okay, ma'am?

29:06.040 --> 29:08.531
My husband is a hero.

29:08.580 --> 29:13.449
He does not need to make
himself feel like one.

29:13.480 --> 29:16.916
Okay. Well, why the hell
is he running around up here

29:16.950 --> 29:18.042
like a dumbass?

29:18.090 --> 29:19.114
(sighs)

29:21.120 --> 29:23.179
Did you know
what he was working on?

29:23.220 --> 29:26.257
KATYA: He never
spoke about it.

29:26.290 --> 29:29.896
For my protection.

29:29.930 --> 29:31.522
How about working for the CIA?

29:31.570 --> 29:33.834
Was that for
your protection, too?

29:35.940 --> 29:38.135
Dmitri is a genius.

29:38.170 --> 29:42.129
And if he has to do something,

29:42.180 --> 29:44.808
then it was
the right thing to do.

29:44.850 --> 29:47.205
Ah. Hey, uh,

29:47.250 --> 29:51.209
that's what you call
right there blind faith.

29:51.250 --> 29:54.879
Yeah. Remind me
when we get back home,

29:54.920 --> 29:57.013
I want to put her
in touch with my wife.

29:57.060 --> 29:59.483
(both laugh)

29:59.530 --> 30:01.521
(helicopter passes overhead)

30:13.410 --> 30:15.378
(bird hoots)

30:23.350 --> 30:25.318
Foo...

30:25.350 --> 30:27.614
Fighters.

30:27.650 --> 30:30.084
Got you, boss.

30:43.570 --> 30:45.538
CLAY:
Friendlies coming in.

30:45.570 --> 30:48.004
RAY: _
Keep coming.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.270
(groans)

30:50.310 --> 30:52.278
(speaks Russian)

30:52.310 --> 30:55.416
KATYA:
Shh.

30:55.450 --> 30:59.147
(both speaking Russian)

31:01.590 --> 31:03.410
KATYA:
It's okay.

31:03.460 --> 31:05.928
JASON:
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

31:05.960 --> 31:08.155
Be advised,
we're heading for the border.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.623
MANDY:
Copy, Bravo 1. Good luck.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.332
Ready?

31:27.950 --> 31:31.078
(groaning softly)

31:31.120 --> 31:33.111
*

31:37.090 --> 31:39.081
(Katya groans softly)

31:54.580 --> 31:57.401
(Katya groans softly)

32:11.260 --> 32:12.420
(whines softly)

32:18.770 --> 32:21.659
(dog panting, whines)

32:28.280 --> 32:29.030
What do we got?

32:30.540 --> 32:32.007
It's coming straight
from the border.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.506
He smelled it
when the wind changed.

32:33.550 --> 32:34.676
RAY:
Could be an animal.

32:36.020 --> 32:38.386
JASON:
Enemy eye or lasers. Move.

32:38.420 --> 32:39.682
Get cover.

32:47.660 --> 32:49.719
SONNY:
Our six is clear.

32:53.100 --> 32:54.692
That definitely
is not an animal.

32:56.240 --> 32:59.164
That's the Russians.

33:04.780 --> 33:07.704
*

33:07.750 --> 33:09.047
Why didn't they shoot?

33:09.080 --> 33:10.616
They don't know who we are.

33:10.650 --> 33:13.744
They're running dark, too.
Can't afford a mistake.

33:13.790 --> 33:15.712
JASON:
The question now becomes,

33:15.760 --> 33:17.182
how do we get past them?

33:18.790 --> 33:20.223
They got night vision.
What about thermals?

33:20.260 --> 33:22.228
We got to figure they have
everything we have.

33:22.260 --> 33:25.024
So the real question is,
how would we get past us?

33:25.070 --> 33:27.721
SONNY: Case of beer
for the new guy.

33:27.770 --> 33:30.193
First time
he said something smart.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.208
Yeah, that's worth
a case of beer.

33:33.240 --> 33:35.037
MARBERRY:
Under no circumstances

33:35.080 --> 33:37.036
am I sending any more Americans
across that border.
Yeah, well,

33:37.080 --> 33:39.571
news flash, we already have
Americans across that border.

33:39.610 --> 33:42.044
Which I'm on record with
the brass as arguing against.

33:42.080 --> 33:43.308
And congratulations
for that,

33:43.350 --> 33:45.238
but we are where we are.
Where we are

33:45.290 --> 33:48.088
is I'm not gonna risk
World War III to save six men.

33:48.120 --> 33:49.610
Where exactly does
that leave our guys?

33:49.660 --> 33:51.287
Russians in front of them,
Chinese infantry

33:51.330 --> 33:52.524
climbing up behind them.
Stop.

33:52.560 --> 33:55.154
Our guys
are Tier One special operators.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.067
As far as extracting themselves
from their current predicament,

33:58.100 --> 34:01.263
my suggestion would be that
they do something... special.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.291
Excuse me.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.438
DAVIS:
Commander,

34:10.480 --> 34:13.244
satellite shows the Chinese
squad two klicks east

34:13.280 --> 34:15.168
of Bravo Team, moving
in their direction.

34:17.850 --> 34:20.739
ERIC: Bravo 1, this is TOC.
Come in. Over.

34:20.790 --> 34:22.155
TOC, how we looking?

34:22.190 --> 34:24.158
The good news is we got
a Special Forces ODA

34:24.190 --> 34:26.158
driving up to meet you on
the Afghan side of the border.

34:26.190 --> 34:26.986
The bad news,

34:27.030 --> 34:27.985
Chinese are two klicks
to the east,

34:28.030 --> 34:30.521
moving in your direction.
Command said that,

34:30.560 --> 34:33.768
until you are back across
that border, you're on your own.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.166
Listen, if there's
a silver lining,

34:36.200 --> 34:37.792
it's that the Russians
don't want to get caught

34:37.840 --> 34:38.829
by the infantry either.

34:38.870 --> 34:41.338
Got no more business
operating in China than we do.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.472
So what you're saying is
we don't have a choice.

34:42.510 --> 34:44.546
We just got to sit here
with the Russians in a standoff

34:44.580 --> 34:46.309
and hope that they blink first?

34:46.350 --> 34:47.544
Basically, yeah.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.687
Hold up.
There might be another way.

34:57.720 --> 34:58.755
Stand by.

35:01.430 --> 35:03.523
Everybody get their NODS up.
Might take a minute or two

35:03.560 --> 35:05.699
to get your eyes adjusted,
but let me know when they're up.

35:07.270 --> 35:11.366
Ray, they're running dark,
we blind them.

35:11.410 --> 35:12.707
Light it up.

35:12.740 --> 35:15.538
Light it up.
Light it up.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.730
All right, boys, the Russians
are also wearing night vision,

35:17.780 --> 35:19.702
so we're gonna throw all
of our flashbangs

35:19.750 --> 35:21.308
and thermite grenades
to whiteout their NVGs

35:21.350 --> 35:23.818
and thermal sights
as we make a run for the border.

35:23.850 --> 35:26.444
Keep lighting it up,
all the way across.

35:26.490 --> 35:29.379
It'll only take their eyes
a minute or two to adjust.

35:29.420 --> 35:30.785
Figure we've got that
same minute or two

35:30.820 --> 35:33.380
to get across the border,
so we'll have to move fast.

35:33.430 --> 35:37.196
SONNY: 250 yards of uneven
ground carrying a litter

35:37.230 --> 35:38.492
in 60 seconds.

35:38.530 --> 35:40.623
Yeah, we got this.

35:40.670 --> 35:43.537
That's right, we got this.
Let's bone her up.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.664
Three, two, one, execute.

36:15.940 --> 36:17.931
(loud banging, men shouting)

36:19.670 --> 36:22.230
(panﬁng)

36:22.280 --> 36:24.271
(banging, shouting continues)

36:35.960 --> 36:37.951
(banging, shouting continues)

37:01.680 --> 37:04.342
(grunting)

37:16.000 --> 37:19.390
Wolverines!

37:23.970 --> 37:25.506
(whoops)

37:25.540 --> 37:26.939
MAN:
Welcome to Afghanistan.

37:26.970 --> 37:29.530
Don't tell me y'all never
seen Red Dawn before.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.377
That's some
of Swayze's best work.

37:31.410 --> 37:33.674
JASON:
I would've gone with Road House.
Let's go.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.712
*

37:47.930 --> 37:49.921
(indistinct chatter)

37:58.340 --> 37:59.568
(bag thuds)

38:04.710 --> 38:06.405
(chuckles)

38:06.450 --> 38:09.613
So, you're in
a standoff.

38:09.650 --> 38:11.345
Need the other guys
to blink first.

38:11.390 --> 38:12.880
Why not make 'em blink?

38:12.920 --> 38:15.787
You know, it pays sometimes,
being a control freak.

38:15.820 --> 38:17.754
Professionally, anyways.

38:17.790 --> 38:20.350
(chuckles)
How'd he do?

38:20.390 --> 38:23.621
How'd he do? Well, how'd he do?

38:23.660 --> 38:25.992
Spenser? He has got

38:26.030 --> 38:27.827
a lot to learn.

38:27.870 --> 38:29.633
You gonna teach him?

38:29.670 --> 38:31.467
Am I gonna teach him?

38:31.510 --> 38:33.660
Time's gonna teach him.
If he doesn't pay attention,

38:33.710 --> 38:35.371
he's gonna get himself killed.

38:39.680 --> 38:42.046
Hey. How many
cases you up to?

38:42.080 --> 38:44.048
Believe it's 19.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.945
This rate, I'm gonna
be broke by Christmas.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.514
Want a little advice?

38:47.550 --> 38:49.609
Yeah, I could use some.

38:49.660 --> 38:52.356
Bring in a couple more cases
tomorrow and the next day,

38:52.390 --> 38:54.858
then buy 'em a keg. They
won't want to do the math.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.959
I bet you they'll
just call it even.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.922
(chuckles)
Thanks.

38:58.970 --> 39:01.530
Hey, you got to keep
a little money in that pocket,

39:01.570 --> 39:02.696
treat that college girl
in the manner

39:02.740 --> 39:03.968
in which she's accustomed.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.365
You know about her, huh?

39:05.410 --> 39:07.366
Another part of my job.

39:09.540 --> 39:11.701
Yeah.
In case you lost count,

39:11.750 --> 39:13.706
we're at 19.

39:13.750 --> 39:15.775
CLAY:
Yeah.

39:17.720 --> 39:20.848
Ah. Yeah, no more
of that foreign beer, okay?

39:20.890 --> 39:22.710
Yeah, I got it.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.819
'Cause there's three things
you never import,

39:24.860 --> 39:25.986
young Jedi.
(chuckles)

39:26.030 --> 39:27.759
That's cars,

39:27.790 --> 39:29.519
beer, and top cheddar.

39:29.560 --> 39:30.424
Top cheddar!

39:30.460 --> 39:31.119
Top cheddar, baby.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.821
Yay! Top cheddar!
(laughter)

39:32.870 --> 39:35.088
(whoops)
Check.

39:35.140 --> 39:37.131
(crickets chirping)

39:38.140 --> 39:40.131
(lock clicking)

39:41.140 --> 39:43.131
(keys jangling)

39:47.880 --> 39:52.146
Mm, I thought ninjas
were supposed to be quiet.

39:53.190 --> 39:55.112
I thought I was being quiet.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.459
So your, uh, first day lasted
the better part of a week.

39:58.490 --> 40:00.685
Oh, man. This might come
as a shock to you,

40:00.730 --> 40:02.527
but I don't have
a whole lot of say in that.

40:02.560 --> 40:04.562
(kissing)

40:07.000 --> 40:08.638
I know that. I missed you.

40:08.670 --> 40:11.138
Just trying to figure out
how worried I ought to be.

40:11.170 --> 40:13.161
Mm.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.777
So, how'd you do?

40:16.810 --> 40:20.940
Um, honestly, I'm not sure.

40:22.880 --> 40:25.440
Mm.

40:26.520 --> 40:29.114
What do you think...
No, no. No, no.
Hmm?

40:29.160 --> 40:30.582
No,honey.No.
Hmm?

40:30.620 --> 40:32.986
You got to shower.

40:33.030 --> 40:34.657
Shower, shower.

40:34.700 --> 40:36.588
All right.
(chuckles)

40:41.230 --> 40:43.892
JASON: Come on, man.
Stop playing.
RAY: No, you stop. You stop.

40:43.940 --> 40:45.908
(whispering):
Stop. Stop. Shh.
Stop playing.

40:45.940 --> 40:47.760
Shh. Stop.

40:47.810 --> 40:50.176
(chuckles)

40:50.210 --> 40:52.041
Shh. Stop.

40:52.080 --> 40:54.002
Okay.
Stop.

40:56.220 --> 40:58.916
Stop. Stop. Stop.
Shh.

40:58.950 --> 41:01.043
Hey.

41:01.090 --> 41:03.479
I think maybe
I fell asleep.

41:03.520 --> 41:06.455
What time is it?

41:08.060 --> 41:09.527
Baby'll be up to nurse soon.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.198
Want me to heat up
some leftovers?

41:11.230 --> 41:12.868
Stop it.

41:12.900 --> 41:14.595
Mm.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.130
Let's put you to bed,
all right?

41:16.170 --> 41:18.035
I was trying to
wait up for you.
You coming back...

41:18.070 --> 41:19.139
you coming back out?

41:19.170 --> 41:21.604
Shh.

41:21.640 --> 41:22.777
Guess not, no.

41:22.810 --> 41:25.074
You good?

41:25.110 --> 41:25.872
No.

41:25.910 --> 41:27.673
But, you know,
go get some sleep.

41:27.710 --> 41:28.677
Or not.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.119
(chuckles)

41:31.180 --> 41:33.216
See you in the
morning, brother.
Yeah.

41:33.250 --> 41:34.751
Bright and early.
Oh, yeah.

41:37.220 --> 41:39.222
