WEBVTT

00:17.350 --> 00:19.561
I take care of him
every single day.

00:19.644 --> 00:22.564
All day long. And you're gonna bawl me out
for one night with my friends?

00:22.647 --> 00:23.565
You think I'm stupid?

00:23.648 --> 00:26.651
-You think I'm gonna believe this shit?
-No. I think you're paranoid.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.319
You need help.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.030
I'm not done talking to you.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.282
- Don't touch me!
-Or what? What are you gonna do?

00:32.365 --> 00:34.576
- Let go of me. You're hurting me.
-You think I'm a fool?

00:34.659 --> 00:35.869
Is that what you think of me?

00:35.952 --> 00:38.163
-Why can't you just do right...
-No, please!

00:38.246 --> 00:40.081
...and love me
like you're supposed to, huh?

00:44.169 --> 00:47.797
<i> It's been said</i>
<i>that dreams are illustrations</i>

00:47.881 --> 00:50.800
<i>from the book</i>
<i>your soul is writing about you.</i>

00:51.009 --> 00:53.845
<i>So why do I keep dreaming</i>
<i>about my childhood?</i>

00:54.471 --> 00:57.348
<i>Dr. Nicky would have said</i>
<i>I have unprocessed feelings</i>

00:57.432 --> 01:00.852
<i>about how my parents</i>
<i>didn't take very good care of me.</i>

01:01.936 --> 01:03.313
<i>But now you do.</i>

01:03.813 --> 01:05.815
<i>In so many ways.</i>

01:09.486 --> 01:10.445
Hey, you.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.822
<i> You make me kinder,</i>

01:13.198 --> 01:14.449
<i>more selfless.</i>

01:15.700 --> 01:17.118
<i>You make me feel good.</i>

01:17.827 --> 01:22.707
<i>So good, I forget whatever darkness</i>
<i>resurfaced in my sleep.</i>

01:22.957 --> 01:25.418
<i>I lose myself in you,</i>

01:25.502 --> 01:27.754
<i>find myself through you,</i>

01:27.837 --> 01:29.297
<i>and when I'm with you,</i>

01:29.380 --> 01:33.134
<i>we're the only two people on Earth.</i>

01:40.475 --> 01:41.434
It's Forty.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.269
Can that wait?

01:43.353 --> 01:45.480
No, I ignored him three times last night.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.273
Okay. Hey.

01:47.732 --> 01:49.776
Lovey, where you been?

01:49.984 --> 01:51.778
<i>Uh, Phone died. What's up?</i>

01:51.861 --> 01:53.488
Ted Hope is what's up.

01:53.738 --> 01:55.406
<i>Ran into him at NeueHouse.</i>

01:55.490 --> 01:59.119
<i>Told him I am this close</i>
<i>to attaching Hendy to my new project,</i>

01:59.202 --> 02:01.579
and he wants to see the full pitch.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.915
Can you even process that?

02:04.374 --> 02:05.250
That's great.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.335
That's really great.

02:07.585 --> 02:11.047
Now all I need to do is mind meld
with our idea machine, Will.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.341
You haven't heard from him, have you?

02:13.424 --> 02:15.009
He... um... hmm.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.137
Yeah, you know,
I haven't heard much from him.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.764
<i>The guy must really not be feeling well.</i>

02:19.848 --> 02:22.142
Yeah, poor guy. Oh.

02:22.684 --> 02:23.601
One other thing.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.312
My inner Sasquatch is coming out,

02:26.396 --> 02:29.691
so I'm gonna need you
to, uh, cut my hair before this meeting.

02:29.774 --> 02:31.109
Yeah, okay. Tomorrow afternoon?

02:31.192 --> 02:33.736
Yeah. Uh, why do you sound
so out of breath?

02:33.820 --> 02:35.947
I'm on the elliptical, you know. Gotta go.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.911
<i> Old me would be annoyed</i>
<i>by such an intrusion.</i>

02:42.370 --> 02:43.663
<i>But new me</i>

02:43.746 --> 02:46.541
<i>-wasn't even fazed by it.</i>

02:46.624 --> 02:49.127
-<i> And you know why that is.</i>
-Oh, right there!

02:49.210 --> 02:51.254
<i>Because I finally feel</i>

02:51.337 --> 02:53.965
<i>like I'm becoming a better man.</i>

02:55.383 --> 02:56.551
That's so fucking good!

02:56.634 --> 02:59.179
<i> And it's all because of you.</i>

03:14.319 --> 03:16.738
Didn't peg you for an outer space guy.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.574
Oh, it came with the apartment.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.910
Along with the pink, fuzzy pillows.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.622
Hey, you can see my house from here.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.750
-All the better to spy on you.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.544
<i> Not that I've needed to</i>
<i>since I trust you completely.</i>

03:40.053 --> 03:41.137
Let me guess.

03:41.512 --> 03:42.347
Forty?

03:42.764 --> 03:44.390
When you text him back just...

03:44.974 --> 03:46.184
don't tell him about us.

03:46.517 --> 03:49.562
<i>But if your brother knew about us,</i>
<i>maybe he'd give us some space.</i>

03:49.646 --> 03:51.272
Remind me again...

03:51.940 --> 03:54.025
why "us" is a secret.

03:54.359 --> 03:57.070
Whenever I start dating someone,

03:57.362 --> 04:00.365
Forty tends to feel threatened.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.533
You know, he doesn't have
many people to count on

04:02.617 --> 04:03.952
so he needs me.

04:04.035 --> 04:07.247
And his sobriety is always
the most fragile in the first...

04:07.497 --> 04:09.457
you know, right after he's slipped.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.834
Let's just give him a week or two

04:12.126 --> 04:13.503
before we, you know,

04:13.878 --> 04:16.506
shove our euphoria in his face.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.384
<i> Even your empathy is a turn-on.</i>

04:20.093 --> 04:21.970
If you're euphoric now, just wait,

04:22.262 --> 04:23.972
just wait until Santa Barbara
this weekend.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.098
I know.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.315
<i> And there goes Santa Barbara.</i>

04:34.941 --> 04:35.900
What if...

04:38.695 --> 04:40.238
we take a rain check

04:40.655 --> 04:41.823
on Santa Barbara?

04:42.240 --> 04:46.369
The more time you spend with him now,
the cooler he'll be when we do tell him.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.748
<i> Anything for you, Love.</i>

04:56.212 --> 04:57.505
I'm seeing him tomorrow night.

04:57.588 --> 04:58.423
Okay.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.844
Well, I guess that means
we'll have to make up for that

05:02.927 --> 05:04.971
lost Santa Barbara sex some other way.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.902
<i> So, this is what it feels like</i>
<i>to be nourished and at peace.</i>

05:20.111 --> 05:22.196
Um what do you think you're doing?

05:22.280 --> 05:23.698
Working on a project?

05:23.781 --> 05:24.991
What project?

05:25.700 --> 05:27.118
I told you, I don't want--

05:27.201 --> 05:29.037
I'm not hanging out
with Henderson anymore.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.707
Why? What'd he do?

05:33.166 --> 05:35.126
He just drinks too much.
It's embarrassing.

05:35.626 --> 05:39.005
<i> This explains why she hasn't</i>
<i>been texting Henderson all week.</i>

05:39.339 --> 05:40.423
<i>Huge relief.</i>

05:40.631 --> 05:42.258
Goetz's dad's girlfriend needs a PA

05:42.342 --> 05:43.968
for a short that starts shooting
next week.

05:44.052 --> 05:47.013
Painfully derivative,
but a credit's a credit.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.681
Till then,

05:49.057 --> 05:51.184
I'm expressing myself through collage.

05:51.267 --> 05:54.187
<i> I never thought I'd say this,</i>
<i>but I feel for Delilah.</i>

05:54.270 --> 05:57.148
<i>She's only trying to protect her sister</i>
<i>from the same sleazeball</i>

05:57.231 --> 05:58.608
<i>she fell victim to.</i>

05:58.858 --> 06:01.277
Just... do not ruin my walls.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.825
Yeah, she so wants to be at power top.

06:07.909 --> 06:08.993
-Tell me about it.
-Mm-hmm.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.329
Can you believe she put
that spy software on my phone?

06:11.412 --> 06:12.288
<i> Shit.</i>

06:12.997 --> 06:14.957
-You sure it was her?
-Who else would it be?

06:15.291 --> 06:17.627
So you're not gonna tell her you know?

06:18.544 --> 06:19.629
Obviously not.

06:20.671 --> 06:23.758
It's way more useful
if she thinks it's still working.

06:24.258 --> 06:27.261
<i> This is what I get</i>
<i>for trying to out-tech a teenager.</i>

06:27.470 --> 06:30.014
<i>It's a good thing I have another way</i>
<i>to keep tabs.</i>

06:36.521 --> 06:37.939
<i> Henderson's jacktop.</i>

06:39.565 --> 06:41.651
<i>Even if he's realized</i>
<i>it's gone missing by now,</i>

06:41.734 --> 06:43.486
<i>I've disabled Find My Friends,</i>

06:43.569 --> 06:46.072
<i>and he hasn't been diligent enough</i>
<i>to un-sync his IMs.</i>

06:54.747 --> 06:56.582
<i>Ellie hasn't fallen in line,</i>

06:56.666 --> 06:57.875
<i>she's gotten craftier.</i>

06:58.126 --> 07:01.254
<i>I could tell Delilah, but then</i>
<i>I'd have to explain how I know.</i>

07:10.847 --> 07:13.599
<i>Or I could take care of it.</i>

07:13.975 --> 07:15.977
<i>The brave, good, right thing to do,</i>

07:16.060 --> 07:17.937
<i>the kind of man you'd want me to be.</i>

07:20.940 --> 07:24.402
<i>People have secret rooms</i>
<i>to hide something shameful</i>

07:24.485 --> 07:26.028
<i>and doubtless, illegal.</i>

07:26.112 --> 07:27.655
<i>If I find what Hendy's hiding,</i>

07:27.864 --> 07:29.824
<i>I can get him arrested and Ellie safe.</i>

07:29.907 --> 07:31.033
<i>I'll make you proud.</i>

07:33.119 --> 07:36.831
<i>With Hendy out of town,</i>
<i>perfect time to get back inside his house.</i>

07:53.181 --> 07:56.309
<i>But first, there's someone else</i>
<i>I have to take care of.</i>

08:05.443 --> 08:06.277
Eat it up.

08:06.861 --> 08:10.156
I paid a lot
for those macrobiotic sea vegetables.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.047
Okay.

08:26.130 --> 08:27.131
Okay what?

08:27.215 --> 08:29.425
Okay, let's have the conversation.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.135
If I let you out...

08:31.928 --> 08:33.095
then what?

08:34.263 --> 08:35.389
Is this a joke?

08:36.140 --> 08:39.602
<i>No, the only joke is me pretending</i>
<i>that keeping a man in a cage</i>

08:39.685 --> 08:41.312
<i>is helping me be my best self.</i>

08:41.395 --> 08:42.313
No.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.940
What's your plan?

08:44.440 --> 08:46.067
My plan is...

08:46.859 --> 08:48.611
to forget any of this happened...

08:49.278 --> 08:52.490
and to live happily ever after
with Gigi in Manila.

08:53.199 --> 08:56.285
<i>Gigi, Will's internet fianc√©e,</i>

08:56.369 --> 08:59.121
<i>a.k.a. least promising plan of all time.</i>

08:59.330 --> 09:02.250
If you bring me the <i>Beast Wars</i> box
in my coat closet,

09:03.084 --> 09:05.169
I can make a fake passport,

09:05.419 --> 09:07.380
and you will never hear from me again.

09:07.463 --> 09:08.464
I have an idea.

09:10.299 --> 09:11.342
You like games.

09:11.717 --> 09:14.720
Love 'em, in other contexts, dude.

09:14.804 --> 09:15.680
Right.

09:16.889 --> 09:17.974
I will let you out...

09:18.558 --> 09:19.433
if you prove

09:19.517 --> 09:21.269
you'll never turn me in.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.146
Prove my loyalty?

09:25.690 --> 09:28.776
And how am I supposed to do that
from inside a cage?

09:30.152 --> 09:32.363
I don't know. You're smart.
I believe in you.

09:35.491 --> 09:36.325
Don't give up.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.328
You need something
to get your brain juices flowing.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.372
You need a project.

09:45.209 --> 09:46.627
What do you need this time?

09:48.504 --> 09:50.965
I need Henderson's home security disabled.

09:51.048 --> 09:53.217
-He's hiding something.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.594
Sounds familiar.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.849
You're gonna need a jammer.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.018
Question is which kind,

10:02.101 --> 10:04.228
so I'll need to know what system he's got.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.648
Oh, am I allowed to touch a laptop

10:07.732 --> 10:09.108
to help you...

10:09.692 --> 10:11.611
help me help you do this thing?

10:18.034 --> 10:19.327
Stop. That one.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.203
Is that a sign by the hedge?

10:22.622 --> 10:25.583
People put those signs around their house
to make them feel safe

10:25.958 --> 10:27.918
because they are, respectfully,

10:28.544 --> 10:30.713
idiots of the highest magnitude.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.424
<i> 'Cause it only makes it easier</i>
<i>for people like me</i>

10:33.507 --> 10:35.718
<i>to find out which frequency</i>
<i>they're broadcasting on.</i>

10:35.801 --> 10:37.470
<i>Once you jam the frequency,</i>

10:37.553 --> 10:39.096
<i>all the sensors are disabled.</i>

10:57.740 --> 11:00.534
<i> Good ol' Hendy has obviously</i>
<i>never seen </i>The Bling Ring.

11:05.456 --> 11:08.042
<i>Okay, Hendy, where's the toy room?</i>

11:10.670 --> 11:13.047
<i>What is this? Like a Narnia situation?</i>

11:13.547 --> 11:15.383
<i>Oh, Mr. Tumnus.</i>

11:42.368 --> 11:43.327
<i>Huh.</i>

11:43.577 --> 11:45.830
<i>Wouldn't have pegged him</i>
<i>for a Dickens guy.</i>

11:49.458 --> 11:51.627
<i>Oh, how very supervillain-y.</i>

12:01.804 --> 12:05.516
<i>It's like Hendy's id</i>
<i>ate too much candy and porn</i>

12:05.599 --> 12:06.809
<i>and threw it all up.</i>

12:22.783 --> 12:26.078
<i> 'Cause nothing's worse</i>
<i>than a sex dungeon with dust bunnies.</i>

12:31.751 --> 12:33.252
<i>Could he be more obvious?</i>

13:05.326 --> 13:06.535
<i>Delilah was right.</i>

13:06.869 --> 13:09.830
<i>He's a bad man</i>
<i>who deserves to be punished.</i>

13:11.415 --> 13:14.543
<i>It's only fitting</i>
<i>that she break the story wide open.</i>

13:34.396 --> 13:35.272
<i>Come on.</i>

13:37.525 --> 13:38.943
<i>You can do this.</i>

13:40.236 --> 13:42.905
<i>-Attagirl, get to work.</i>

13:51.163 --> 13:53.082
<i> With Hendy being capably dealt with,</i>

13:53.165 --> 13:55.709
<i>I can go back to my Love bubble with you.</i>

13:55.793 --> 13:57.711
No, you don't understand.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.131
-Oh, my God.
- Yes, please.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.342
- That is crazy.
Hey!

14:03.843 --> 14:06.136
-Look who I ran into.
-Hi.

14:10.975 --> 14:14.520
<i>Old me might have been annoyed</i>
<i>by this coincidence,</i>

14:14.603 --> 14:17.565
<i>but your friends are refreshingly chill</i>
<i>and easy to talk to.</i>

14:17.648 --> 14:21.026
I read in our <i>Kundalini Cookbook</i>
that golden milk is a life-changer.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.445
Into Kundalini, okay.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.531
<i> Actually, I'm not, but Gabe is.</i>

14:25.614 --> 14:27.616
<i>Constantly retweets his guru.</i>

14:27.700 --> 14:29.326
I mean, I'm just curious, I'm a novice.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.953
Oh, I can help you out with that.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.790
-Will it help my stress-induced gastritis?
-What?

14:34.874 --> 14:37.877
Oh, Emma showed up to set the other day
with her head and eyebrows shaved,

14:37.960 --> 14:40.754
so I spent the last 72 hours
emotionally blowing the director

14:40.838 --> 14:42.381
just trying to get her, like, un-fired.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.508
-What've you done about the tummy stuff?
-Ashita..

14:44.592 --> 14:46.969
-Good.
-But she says it's a pitta imbalance,

14:47.052 --> 14:47.887
Of course.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.097
Yeah, but she refuses to do blood cleanse.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.308
- Because it tastes like fresh anus.

14:52.391 --> 14:53.893
<i> Did she just say "blood cleanse"?</i>

14:53.976 --> 14:55.394
Tell me you're doing reiki. Come on.

14:55.477 --> 14:56.979
Or, you know, cupping will help.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.273
This is great, but it's not
gonna work because, hello,

14:59.356 --> 15:00.482
it's past life trauma.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.483
Always.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.990
<i> Shit, that wasn't a joke. Say</i>
<i> something. Say something, anything.</i>

15:10.284 --> 15:11.660
Have you tried going to the doctor?

15:11.994 --> 15:13.913
Like, a Western medicine doctor?

15:15.497 --> 15:16.332
I'm kidding.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.541
I'm obviously kidding.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.794
- That's funny.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.796
I mean, everyone
has their own lens, right?

15:23.088 --> 15:24.048
Of course.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.257
<i> You're disappointed.</i>

15:25.341 --> 15:28.260
<i>I flunked, I embarrassed you.</i>
<i>How do I fix this?</i>

15:28.719 --> 15:30.262
Okay, can we just tell 'em?

15:30.804 --> 15:31.764
Okay.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.183
We didn't accidentally run into you guys.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.101
-We planned it!
-Yeah!

15:37.311 --> 15:39.188
- Surprise!
-Really?

15:40.230 --> 15:41.565
-Yeah.
-Well...

15:41.649 --> 15:44.151
<i> If I didn't know you better,</i>
<i>I'd call that a sneaky,</i>

15:44.234 --> 15:46.570
<i>insecure Beck kind of move.</i>

15:46.654 --> 15:47.905
<i>Do I know you better?</i>

15:47.988 --> 15:49.406
Okay, so...

15:50.366 --> 15:51.617
I just thought...

15:52.242 --> 15:56.747
that if I was going to meet
your insanely tight inner circle,

15:57.331 --> 15:59.917
you know, I would get in my head

16:00.000 --> 16:03.420
and, like, research everyone, and...

16:04.338 --> 16:06.548
I just wanted you
to be able to be relaxed.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.884
<i> You did this for me.</i>

16:10.719 --> 16:11.595
Okay.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.974
Then can someone please tell me
what the hell a pitta imbalance is?

16:15.057 --> 16:17.142
-Oh, yes.
- Oh, honey.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.812
I thought you would never ask. Um,

16:19.895 --> 16:21.188
it's usually stress-induced...

16:21.271 --> 16:22.481
I love him.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.024
<i> And just like that,</i>

16:24.358 --> 16:26.068
<i>I'm part of the tribe.</i>

16:26.694 --> 16:30.322
<i>No longer on the outside looking in,</i>
<i>thanks to you. </i>

16:33.367 --> 16:34.702
Did you invite him?

16:35.202 --> 16:36.036
No.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.709
Hey, Forty, I thought it was your day off.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.585
Just coming in for my green juice.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.796
-Well, join us. Grab a bun.
-Yeah.

16:46.088 --> 16:49.133
Wait, Love, weren't you checking out
agave wholesalers today?

16:49.341 --> 16:52.261
Yeah, I was going to
and then we all ran into each other.

16:53.887 --> 16:54.805
Mm-hmm.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.765
Why don't you just sit down?

16:56.849 --> 16:57.725
Why?

16:58.058 --> 16:59.727
So you can lie to my face right now?

17:00.644 --> 17:03.272
Yeah, I've been knowing
that you two were hooking up.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.443
And I was just waiting
for you to come clean.

17:08.235 --> 17:10.779
And you don't even have the decency

17:11.196 --> 17:13.198
to invite me to your coming-out brunch.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.992
We can talk when I cut your hair--

17:15.075 --> 17:17.202
No, you're not touching my hair!

17:17.786 --> 17:21.415
Forty, this is not the time or place.
You need to stop it now.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.257
Hey, hey. Just let him go.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.815
<i> What Forty needs are boundaries.</i>

17:46.940 --> 17:48.108
-Oh!

17:53.614 --> 17:54.448
It isn't him.

17:56.366 --> 17:57.576
He's punishing me.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.411
God.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.122
I hope he's not drinking.

18:03.707 --> 18:06.168
I should-- I should text his sponsor.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.046
<i> Honestly, you could both</i>
<i>use some boundaries.</i>

18:09.129 --> 18:12.341
<i>But I don't blame you.</i>
<i>Every one of us has a blind spot.</i>

18:12.424 --> 18:13.592
-No.

18:13.926 --> 18:14.843
I shouldn't.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.596
This is crazy.

18:17.679 --> 18:20.182
I am...  crazy!

18:22.851 --> 18:23.727
You're not crazy.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.522
You are <i>trying</i> to be a good sister.

18:26.772 --> 18:30.692
<i> Here is where old me would suggest</i>
<i>you need to distance yourself,</i>

18:30.776 --> 18:33.946
<i>even if that meant pushing Forty</i>
<i>further toward the edge.</i>

18:34.029 --> 18:36.573
Then why do I feel so shitty?

18:38.534 --> 18:42.037
<i> But new me, the me I'm becoming</i>
<i>because of you,</i>

18:42.121 --> 18:45.124
<i>is going to make this better for you, me,</i>
<i>and Forty.</i>

18:45.207 --> 18:46.208
Forty wants to be--

18:46.291 --> 18:47.209
Can you just...?

18:49.461 --> 18:50.838
Forty wants to be included.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.507
All right? So let's include him.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.843
Standing Sunday brunch thing.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.595
Beach day once a month.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.389
-Once.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.894
Yeah, I think he would really like that.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.148
Starting now,
I'm gonna be a better friend.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.901
I'm gonna help him come up
with a killer pitch.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.822
<i> Busier he is with a viable project,</i>
<i>the less dependent he'll be on you.</i>

19:16.905 --> 19:18.991
I cannot ask you to do that.

19:19.908 --> 19:22.244
You didn't. It would be my honor.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.054
Aw, man.

19:41.638 --> 19:42.472
That...

19:42.848 --> 19:43.807
That was heaven.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.517
That was medicine.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.561
They should bottle you, Delilah.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.438
They should.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.028
You okay?

19:56.320 --> 19:57.237
What? Yeah, yeah.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.697
You sure? You seem...

19:59.323 --> 20:00.199
kinda distant.

20:00.282 --> 20:03.702
I'm sorry,
are we <i>that</i> kind of fuck buddy now?

20:03.785 --> 20:06.163
You know, we can talk about real stuff...

20:06.788 --> 20:09.625
without violating
the fuck buddy code of ethics.

20:09.708 --> 20:10.918
It's-- It's been done.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.546
Okay. Um...

20:14.922 --> 20:17.883
I am... dealing with a thing.

20:18.383 --> 20:21.053
And I could actually use
some professional advice.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.430
Like from... Yeah, of course.

20:23.513 --> 20:26.433
But like so fucking off the record,
it's not even funny.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.603
Okay, OTR, I got it.

20:29.686 --> 20:30.520
Okay.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.357
Someone anonymously...

20:33.899 --> 20:36.443
sent me some photos that I know for a fact

20:36.526 --> 20:40.113
were taken by a certain
high-profile celebrity.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.493
And some of the girls in the photos,

20:45.035 --> 20:46.328
maybe all...

20:46.870 --> 20:48.163
are underage.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.750
That prick you've been trying to nail,
Henderson.

20:52.376 --> 20:55.128
Maybe one of your sources
is trying to give you some more ammo.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.213
Maybe.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.174
I want to write the expos√©. I want to...

20:59.716 --> 21:02.636
nail his one remaining ball
to the ceiling, but...

21:03.178 --> 21:04.638
the more that I think about it...

21:05.889 --> 21:07.432
I'm one of the girls.

21:10.185 --> 21:11.561
Oh, no, man, Delilah--

21:11.645 --> 21:14.273
And if I break the story,
and it comes out later

21:14.356 --> 21:16.817
that the same thing happened to me,
then I lose all credibility.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.528
The whole story just gets picked apart.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.488
I could take the photos into Sex Crimes.

21:22.322 --> 21:23.907
I'll say that I got them anonymously.

21:23.991 --> 21:27.619
Yeah, so some star-fucker cops
can get paid off to bury them? Yeah.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.913
I know the right people
to talk to, Delilah.

21:30.580 --> 21:31.623
Don't you trust me?

21:35.669 --> 21:36.503
Okay.

21:52.102 --> 21:55.647
Come on, people must have told you
you look like a model.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.525
-We should get a drink sometime.
-You're single?

21:59.067 --> 22:00.319
It's complicated.

22:00.610 --> 22:04.156
I'm going out of town tomorrow,
but I could take you out tonight.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.908
Tonight doesn't work,
but how about now?

22:06.992 --> 22:09.953
Seems like you've got
your hands full already.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.583
Oh, he's a big boy.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.134
I'm gonna need you to stay here for a bit.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.178
Read your book. I'll be back.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.774
-Don't go too short like last time, okay?
- I'm not.

22:39.399 --> 22:40.692
You asked me to do this.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.863
Top of the morning, will.i.am.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.073
I hope we didn't wake you.

22:46.156 --> 22:47.157
I hope we did.

22:47.991 --> 22:51.703
So I can apologize
for losing my shit yesterday.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.998
Oh, it's already forgotten.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.710
You are one magnanimous motherfucker.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.295
And we...

23:00.837 --> 23:02.672
are going to make a great team.

23:02.756 --> 23:05.926
Right. I told Forty that you said
you would help him with his project.

23:06.218 --> 23:09.012
<i>-</i> <i>Only so I can have more of you.</i>
-Absolutely.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.347
Schweet.

23:10.430 --> 23:14.059
I had to push the Ted Hope meeting
because I was irate after...

23:14.559 --> 23:17.270
Well, we don't need to talk
about the brunch anymore.

23:17.604 --> 23:20.273
Uh, but It's fine. I'll pitch him
when he gets back from South By.

23:20.357 --> 23:21.608
Sounds like a plan.

23:21.691 --> 23:23.443
But you and I should get started
this afternoon.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.487
-Okay.
-Also, Lovey said something

23:25.570 --> 23:27.697
about all of us going
to the beach later today?

23:27.781 --> 23:28.740
Oh, right.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.326
<i> Sooner than I'd care to, but...</i>

23:31.410 --> 23:32.285
Great.

23:32.369 --> 23:33.829
But I need Love...

23:34.287 --> 23:36.706
to go with me
to buy a new suit for the pitch.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.458
Sure, let's go shopping.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.378
No, like, just me and Love.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.173
I get self-conscious
when I go suit shopping because of...

23:46.341 --> 23:47.342
my thighs.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.512
Forty, Will and I have plans.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.723
It's fine. Will doesn't mind.

23:54.891 --> 23:55.934
Do you, old sport?

23:57.602 --> 23:59.521
<i> Your brother is a monster.</i>

23:59.604 --> 24:00.439
Not at all.

24:02.232 --> 24:03.150
Happy shopping.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.738
<i> Becoming a better person</i>
<i>is way more aggravating than I thought,</i>

24:08.822 --> 24:11.241
<i>but I'm still going to find a way</i>
<i>to help your brother.</i>

24:12.075 --> 24:12.951
How's book one?

24:13.034 --> 24:16.538
Margarita just rescued the rape victim
from eternal damnation.

24:16.746 --> 24:19.499
So, uh,  you know... light beach reading.

24:25.213 --> 24:27.007
That's the book guy?

24:27.424 --> 24:28.800
He doesn't play for your team.

24:28.884 --> 24:32.012
No fair. You already have Hendy
so why do you get all the hot zaddies?

24:32.262 --> 24:33.930
Okay, first,

24:34.014 --> 24:35.974
Will is like a eunuch to me.

24:36.391 --> 24:37.434
And Hendy?

24:37.517 --> 24:39.603
He is not my zaddy either.

24:39.686 --> 24:40.896
Which reminds me,

24:41.271 --> 24:42.856
I'm going to his screening tonight.

24:42.939 --> 24:45.859
Text me and invite me to sleep over
so D thinks I'm at your place.

24:45.942 --> 24:46.985
Thank you.

24:49.446 --> 24:52.324
<i> Why hasn't Delilah</i>
<i>gotten Henderson arrested yet?</i>

25:05.378 --> 25:07.047
<i> Flaming Hot Cheetos.</i>

25:07.130 --> 25:09.341
<i>Stress food, very bad sign.</i>

25:09.799 --> 25:11.927
Management should really get that fixed.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.513
What do you need, Apartment Three?

25:15.430 --> 25:18.350
Just wanted to make sure
you got that envelope on your doorstep.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.520
How did you know about that?

25:22.229 --> 25:23.939
I saw a girl drop it off.

25:24.940 --> 25:25.774
What'd she look like?

25:26.191 --> 25:28.693
I saw her from behind.
She had a... hoodie.

25:28.777 --> 25:29.611
Why?

25:31.404 --> 25:32.239
Nothing.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.115
Doesn't seem like nothing.

25:34.908 --> 25:36.243
Hey, is someone harassing you?

25:36.326 --> 25:37.244
No.

25:37.786 --> 25:41.248
Delilah, I've seen the look on your face.
If someone is bothering you, just--

25:42.666 --> 25:43.667
-Hi.
-Hi.

25:46.169 --> 25:48.630
If someone is bothering you,
go to the cops.

25:48.713 --> 25:51.007
-I'll go with you.
-Would you relax? Nobody's stalking me.

25:54.135 --> 25:55.428
This is about Henderson.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.808
The woman you saw dropped
his kiddie porn photos on my doorstep.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.102
Well, this is great, right?

26:02.352 --> 26:04.604
I showed 'em to a cop,
and he said they're useless

26:04.688 --> 26:07.107
and he can't do shit with them
because Henderson's not in them.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.234
And the backdrop's completely nondescript.

26:09.818 --> 26:10.902
Bastard's smart.

26:11.528 --> 26:14.406
-<i> Shit. Shit, shit, shit!</i>
-So what are you gonna do?

26:14.489 --> 26:17.033
Stick 'em in a drawer until somebody else
blows the whistle on him.

26:17.742 --> 26:20.829
If the police had found them on Henderson
or in Henderson's house,

26:20.912 --> 26:23.623
then they could've made a case,
but as it is...

26:24.583 --> 26:26.835
whoever swiped them
bungled the shit out of this.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.135
<i> Double fuck!</i>

26:35.218 --> 26:37.429
<i>Promised to help your brother,</i>
<i>but now I have to make sure</i>

26:37.512 --> 26:40.181
<i>Ellie doesn't</i>
<i>walk into the jaws of perversion.</i>

26:40.557 --> 26:42.183
<i>I'll have to keep it short with Forty.</i>

26:43.351 --> 26:44.185
Sit down.

26:44.811 --> 26:45.729
In the end,

26:46.146 --> 26:49.524
our guy has to murder all three women.

26:50.358 --> 26:52.736
It's like... the ultimate irony.

26:54.779 --> 26:55.739
So what do you think?

26:56.072 --> 26:58.908
<i> That it sounds like the most</i>
<i>anti-feminist horror film in history,</i>

26:58.992 --> 27:01.244
<i>-which is saying a lot.</i>
-I think it's really good.

27:01.328 --> 27:03.121
You don't think it gets wonky
in the middle?

27:03.204 --> 27:04.831
-No.
-You don't think we need to, like,

27:04.914 --> 27:07.125
spitball that page 90 shit?

27:07.417 --> 27:10.670
<i> He's not going to let me leave</i>
<i>until I say...</i>

27:10.754 --> 27:12.088
Honestly, I think it's genius.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.175
Okay...

27:15.675 --> 27:18.053
don't throw the G word around
if you don't mean it, Will.

27:18.428 --> 27:19.846
-I do.
-I knew it.

27:20.263 --> 27:23.183
Man, I wish I could go
to South By Pitch Fest tomorrow.

27:23.683 --> 27:24.684
It's fine.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.770
Gives us more time
to work the dough, right?

27:27.437 --> 27:28.772
I think we are on a roll.

27:28.855 --> 27:30.982
I think... we should go all night?

27:31.274 --> 27:34.611
<i> How do I get out now</i>
<i>without this six-foot-one baby</i>

27:34.694 --> 27:35.612
<i>throwing a tantrum?</i>

27:35.695 --> 27:38.239
No, no.
You don't want to overwork the dough.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.158
I think you should go to South By tonight.

27:40.700 --> 27:41.660
Pitch it tomorrow.

27:42.118 --> 27:43.787
-For reals?
-Take the red-eye.

27:44.287 --> 27:46.456
You said Ted Hope is there, right?

27:46.539 --> 27:47.999
Show him you're in demand.

27:48.208 --> 27:49.834
Start a bidding war.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.796
-Fuck yeah.
-Fuck yeah.

27:52.879 --> 27:54.589
-I'm gonna do it.
-Good for you.

28:01.930 --> 28:02.764
<i> Where you been?</i>

28:03.473 --> 28:04.599
At the market.

28:04.683 --> 28:05.850
For four hours?

28:05.975 --> 28:07.227
You should ask your son.

28:07.310 --> 28:09.729
He wanted to play hide-and-seek
and scare Mommy.

28:11.648 --> 28:13.441
I'm gonna get the rest of the groceries.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.785
You're old enough to know that your mom...

28:24.452 --> 28:27.539
sometimes accidentally tells a little lie.

28:28.164 --> 28:31.042
But I know you always tell the truth.

28:32.335 --> 28:33.211
Come here, Joey.

28:34.212 --> 28:35.171
Come here.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.556
Pain, it can make people truthful.

28:44.639 --> 28:45.515
Hey.

28:46.307 --> 28:47.642
What you doing with that rope?

28:48.518 --> 28:50.186
Don't worry, it's for Henderson.

28:51.479 --> 28:52.355
Uh-huh...

28:53.690 --> 28:57.068
And what exactly
are you planning to do to him?

28:58.027 --> 28:59.904
Gonna get him to confess on video,

29:00.447 --> 29:02.198
ruin his career, and get him arrested.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.451
Why? What'd you think I was gonna say?

29:06.202 --> 29:07.871
Someone else, not you...

29:09.205 --> 29:12.834
a less stable person might see...

29:13.501 --> 29:16.337
Hendy's depravity
as justification for killing him.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.007
That's not me.

29:20.717 --> 29:21.593
I know.

29:22.469 --> 29:23.720
I know it's not.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.557
You're thoughtful, controlled...

29:30.310 --> 29:31.519
The more I learn about you,

29:31.603 --> 29:34.105
the more clearly I see
the answer to your question.

29:34.647 --> 29:35.857
How can you...

29:36.357 --> 29:39.778
be sure I'll be loyal once you let me out?

29:40.653 --> 29:41.696
The answer is...

29:43.782 --> 29:45.033
there is no answer.

29:45.575 --> 29:48.369
No matter what I say, you will never
be sure if I'll turn you in.

29:48.453 --> 29:51.331
<i> But I need to be sure, Love, for us.</i>

29:51.414 --> 29:52.373
Hold on.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.752
I know you want to do the right thing

29:55.835 --> 29:58.171
or you wouldn't have asked at all.

29:58.755 --> 30:02.175
I've done business with bad people,
you're not them.

30:02.842 --> 30:03.676
You...

30:04.260 --> 30:06.596
do bad things when you feel trapped

30:07.138 --> 30:10.183
or, key, to protect someone, which...

30:10.725 --> 30:13.603
we all hope we would have the courage
to do that.

30:14.521 --> 30:16.606
To me, that makes you more good than bad.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.442
I think you're a good man.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.028
You could kill Henderson,

30:22.111 --> 30:24.572
but you're letting justice
take its course.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.075
That's what a good man would do.

30:27.158 --> 30:29.702
<i> He's biased, but I hope he's right.</i>

30:30.078 --> 30:32.705
But to really be good, Joe,

30:32.789 --> 30:34.374
you have to let me out of here.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.460
<i> Another impossible puzzle, Love,</i>

30:37.544 --> 30:40.004
<i>but for you, I'll try to solve anything.</i>

30:45.426 --> 30:48.179
<i> It's not the best time,</i>
<i>but you always come first.</i>

30:48.263 --> 30:49.097
Hey, you.

30:49.347 --> 30:52.433
Did you tell Forty
to take a red-eye to South By?

30:53.226 --> 30:54.435
I may have mentioned it, yeah.

30:54.519 --> 30:58.147
I really wish you would have asked me.
Film fests are tough on his sobriety.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.732
I didn't realize that, I'm sorry.

30:59.816 --> 31:02.235
I appreciate that,
but it still feels weird,

31:02.318 --> 31:04.070
like you were trying
to get him out of town

31:04.153 --> 31:05.989
so that you wouldn't have
to deal with him.

31:06.072 --> 31:08.950
<i> Being attracted to very smart women</i>
<i>is a double-edged sword.</i>

31:09.033 --> 31:11.744
-I would never do that.
<i>-He said you used the words "bidding war."</i>

31:11.828 --> 31:12.954
<i> I should lie.</i>

31:13.162 --> 31:16.291
<i>Half-truths just end up getting me burned</i>
<i>so I should lie.</i>

31:16.374 --> 31:18.459
Will, please do not make this worse
by lying to me.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.712
<i> I have to because I can't tell you</i>
<i>the whole truth,</i>

31:20.795 --> 31:23.006
<i>which happens to be I did it</i>
<i>to save someone helpless.</i>

31:23.089 --> 31:24.924
<i>Speaking of, need to stop her, now.</i>

31:25.383 --> 31:26.634
<i> Hello? Are you there?</i>

31:26.718 --> 31:28.553
<i> Yeah, I'm-- I'm here. I'm here.</i>

31:29.762 --> 31:30.930
You're right.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.640
<i>I just wasn't thinking. I messed up.</i>

31:32.724 --> 31:35.268
And from now on, I'll do better.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.561
I promise.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.771
That is what I needed to hear.

31:38.855 --> 31:40.982
<i>Now I have to go.</i>
<i>I don't want to miss my flight.</i>

31:41.858 --> 31:42.775
-Your flight?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

31:42.859 --> 31:45.612
I'm going to be Forty's sober companion
at South By.

31:46.613 --> 31:49.240
<i> Kill me now.</i>
<i>Kill Forty, kill everything.</i>

31:49.324 --> 31:51.200
-Have a great trip.
<i>-Call you from Austin.</i>

31:51.618 --> 31:54.829
<i> Perfect. Now I have to get Ellie out</i>
<i>of Henderson's, then get his confession.</i>

31:54.913 --> 31:56.122
<i>I'm not sure how to do either.</i>

31:56.205 --> 31:57.540
<i>What could go wrong?</i>

32:03.755 --> 32:05.632
-@Ellie-Eyeballs, hey.
-Hey.

32:05.715 --> 32:08.092
So bad news.
Jonah's girl came down with the flu

32:08.176 --> 32:10.094
and Jonah's the one with the print,

32:10.470 --> 32:12.096
so no screening tonight. Sorry.

32:12.388 --> 32:13.973
Here, I'll call you an Uber.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.475
Wait, dude, I came all this way.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.477
We can still hang.

32:17.727 --> 32:18.937
I can show you my short.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.980
It's still in progress, but--

32:21.064 --> 32:23.316
Listen, we're friends and it's cool.

32:23.399 --> 32:25.276
I mean, you're massively cool, but...

32:26.152 --> 32:27.278
you're also 15,

32:27.362 --> 32:29.656
so we're not hanging out
in my house alone.

32:31.407 --> 32:32.825
<i> What is his game here?</i>

32:32.909 --> 32:34.285
Okay, neurotic.

32:34.661 --> 32:37.163
I'm not some random girl child.

32:37.246 --> 32:39.290
And you said for weeks
you would watch my short.

32:40.124 --> 32:40.959
All right, fine.

32:41.042 --> 32:42.919
But you have to promise me
you won't tell anybody

32:43.002 --> 32:45.296
that you were here alone with me, okay?
'Cause it's kinda--

32:45.380 --> 32:46.255
I get it.

32:46.339 --> 32:48.299
I'm a vault. Scout's honor.

32:48.883 --> 32:52.720
<i> Oh, this is his clever trick</i>
<i>to make her feel safe,</i>

32:52.804 --> 32:54.472
<i>like she chose.</i>

33:13.825 --> 33:15.368
-You're a filmmaker.

33:15.785 --> 33:18.579
I saw some <i>Rear Window</i>
and a little bit of...

33:19.122 --> 33:21.374
<i>Florida Project,</i> but with your own pathos.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.752
I-- I think you could've
held on the last image a bit longer.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.713
That's what I was thinking.

33:27.380 --> 33:30.258
I'm proud of you, Eyeballs.
Now I really wanna hear your feature idea.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.760
Great. I've got a whole pitch prepared--

33:33.052 --> 33:35.722
And I have, like, a super early morning.

33:35.805 --> 33:37.473
Dude, ten minutes.

33:37.890 --> 33:40.351
It's right up your alley
and I think you'll like it enough

33:40.435 --> 33:42.520
to share it
with your producing partners, really.

33:44.647 --> 33:47.608
Well, I never pitch without
at least one Scotch in me for luck,

33:47.692 --> 33:49.485
so in your case, what do you want? Juice?

33:49.694 --> 33:51.237
Uh, yeah, I'll take a watermelon.

33:51.988 --> 33:52.822
Okay.

34:07.086 --> 34:08.963
<i> No alcohol. Interesting.</i>

34:14.343 --> 34:18.931
<i>And a twist of GHB</i>
<i>for roofie-ing the teenaged girl.</i>

34:26.939 --> 34:27.815
What the heck?

35:02.475 --> 35:04.602
A little piece of advice: don't get a cat.

35:09.273 --> 35:10.108
Here.

35:10.775 --> 35:11.609
Cheers.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.154
To making art.

35:17.031 --> 35:19.909
<i> To his dose kicking in first,</i>
<i>which it will.</i>

35:19.992 --> 35:22.370
<i>It's a hell of a lot stronger.</i>

35:22.453 --> 35:23.287
All right.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.146
What the fuck. Hey.

35:48.729 --> 35:49.647
Hey, hey.

35:50.106 --> 35:51.149
Huh? What?

35:52.233 --> 35:54.360
Easy, easy. You're gonna hurt yourself.

35:54.443 --> 35:55.403
Who are you?

35:55.903 --> 35:57.029
Untie me!

35:57.113 --> 36:00.992
-<i> Oh, white male celebrity privilege.</i>
-Help me! Help! Help me!

36:01.826 --> 36:03.244
You know this room is soundproof.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.913
-You built it to be soundproof.
-Help me!

36:07.999 --> 36:08.958
Help me!

36:09.041 --> 36:11.627
I'm going to help you after you confess

36:11.711 --> 36:13.546
to what you've been hiding
in this little...

36:13.838 --> 36:15.006
secret room.

36:15.923 --> 36:17.175
Secret room? What...?

36:18.259 --> 36:20.219
You mean this room
that everybody knows about?

36:20.303 --> 36:23.139
This is just standard, mass-produced
Pleasure Chest kink.

36:23.222 --> 36:24.098
It's not illegal.

36:24.724 --> 36:28.144
<i> Hiding his real perversion</i>
<i>behind healthy fetishes is smart</i>

36:28.227 --> 36:29.061
<i>and evil.</i>

36:29.145 --> 36:30.188
I'm not talking about kink,

36:30.271 --> 36:32.273
I'm talking about your thing
for underage girls.

36:32.648 --> 36:34.942
Like the one upstairs, for starters.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.028
Ellie? I never touched her.

36:37.111 --> 36:39.405
I don't have a thing for underaged girls.
This is insane!

36:39.488 --> 36:42.241
The pictures in your cigar box
suggest otherwise!

36:45.203 --> 36:46.120
Those aren't mine.

36:46.204 --> 36:49.040
I'm holding them for a friend, all right?
He knows he needs help.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.666
<i> I'm not gonna kill him.</i>

36:50.750 --> 36:52.835
<i>Just scare him into telling the truth.</i>

36:54.212 --> 36:55.838
What are you doing?
No, what are you doing?

36:55.922 --> 36:58.382
No, no no! What do you want?
What do you want?

36:58.466 --> 37:00.635
-Ow!
-No, no! What do you want?!

37:00.718 --> 37:02.595
You know what I want.

37:02.845 --> 37:04.013
The truth.

37:04.513 --> 37:06.390
Okay, okay!
They're mine, they're mine!

37:06.474 --> 37:08.017
Okay, I-- I never touched them, I swear.

37:08.100 --> 37:10.186
They would fall asleep
and I would take their tops off,

37:10.269 --> 37:12.980
snap a few photos, which I wouldn't
share with anyone,  and then...

37:13.689 --> 37:16.192
Who gets hurt? Nobody.
They don't even remember.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.069
<i> Delilah remembers.</i>

37:18.611 --> 37:19.445
You're wrong.

37:20.029 --> 37:22.698
And if you believe any
of what you just said, you're sick.

37:22.782 --> 37:24.033
These are kids.

37:25.409 --> 37:28.246
Listen, man,
if I did this to your girlfriend...

37:28.746 --> 37:31.165
a long time ago or something,
I'm really sorry.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.333
I'm sorry. I...

37:33.459 --> 37:34.627
I can pay you both.

37:34.710 --> 37:35.920
I don't want your money.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.297
I want your confession on video.

37:39.423 --> 37:40.258
What?

37:43.135 --> 37:44.053
I can't do that.

37:44.136 --> 37:46.264
That would destroy me.
I'd lose everything.

37:46.347 --> 37:47.181
Oh...

37:48.182 --> 37:49.058
You deserve to.

37:49.141 --> 37:51.686
No, no, no! Okay, okay, okay!
I'll do it, I'll do it! Please.

37:54.063 --> 37:54.981
Remember...

37:55.523 --> 37:57.858
this is of your own volition.

38:01.862 --> 38:02.697
Okay.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.991
Don't look so scared. Take a breath.

38:07.952 --> 38:09.537
Now, look into the camera.

38:16.085 --> 38:17.878
What do you want me to say? What, I'm...?

38:18.629 --> 38:19.588
I'm a sicko?

38:22.300 --> 38:23.759
Okay, fine, I'm-- I'm bad.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.344
All right, I'm disgusting.

38:27.013 --> 38:28.639
What, do you think I like this shit?!

38:31.392 --> 38:33.185
My stepdad, he-- he touched me.

38:33.519 --> 38:34.478
Stop that.

38:34.937 --> 38:37.523
When I told my mom about it,
she made me promise not to tell anyone.

38:37.606 --> 38:40.192
-No, stop. I don't want stories.
-All this started when I was nine.

38:40.276 --> 38:43.154
-I was only nine years old.
-Henderson-- Henderson, shut up.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.324
-This happened to you too, didn't it?
-No. No, no, no.

38:46.407 --> 38:47.992
-That's why you're doing this?
-No.

38:48.075 --> 38:50.161
You hate yourself
so you're trying to destroy me?

38:50.244 --> 38:51.287
I'm warning you.

38:51.704 --> 38:53.748
-We're the same.
-No, no...

38:56.083 --> 38:58.336
I'm nothing... like <i>you.</i>

39:02.381 --> 39:03.424
I know you. You...

39:04.633 --> 39:07.345
You're from my party, right?
You're Forty's friend.

39:07.928 --> 39:10.598
You were trying to help him,
you were trying to be a hero.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.016
Is that what you think this is, huh?

39:12.099 --> 39:14.727
You feel like you're a piece of shit
so you're trying to be a hero.

39:16.979 --> 39:19.106
-That's enough.
-Ruining my life is not gonna save you

39:19.190 --> 39:21.901
from your demons, all right?
What we went through, this shit stays.

39:21.984 --> 39:24.653
No amount of sex or drugs
or success or religion

39:24.737 --> 39:26.280
or surviving fucking ball cancer,

39:26.364 --> 39:28.074
that's not gonna save you, okay?
Nothing can.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.409
<i> He's trying to get in my head.</i>

39:30.493 --> 39:32.411
-Love can.
<i>-</i> <i>We're nothing alike.</i>

39:32.495 --> 39:34.121
Love is the biggest phony of them all.

39:34.497 --> 39:37.208
You want something real?
An orgasm is real.

39:37.625 --> 39:38.876
<i> He's desperate.</i>

39:38.959 --> 39:42.129
<i>He's trying to win with words and ideas</i>
<i>that add up to nothing,</i>

39:42.213 --> 39:45.174
<i>but the truth: he is bad.</i>

39:45.257 --> 39:47.843
<i>Someone needs to stop him</i>
<i>and he knows it.</i>

40:09.365 --> 40:10.199
<i> No.</i>

40:10.282 --> 40:11.992
<i>No, this isn't me.</i>

40:12.076 --> 40:13.494
<i>This isn't me anymore.</i>

40:13.911 --> 40:16.831
<i>I didn't want to do that.</i>
<i>I didn't do that.</i>

40:18.833 --> 40:20.000
<i>Get it together.</i>

40:31.804 --> 40:32.930
<i>A suicide.</i>

40:33.389 --> 40:34.723
<i>He slit his wrist, regretted it...</i>

40:35.307 --> 40:37.435
<i>went for help, fell going up the stairs.</i>

40:40.980 --> 40:44.400
<i>No, no no no, can't have another</i>
<i>jar of urine scenario.</i>

41:13.888 --> 41:14.722
<i> Shit.</i>

41:25.232 --> 41:26.150
Hendy?

41:42.875 --> 41:44.293
All right, later, loser.

41:44.710 --> 41:45.586
I'm leaving.

41:53.761 --> 41:55.763
<i> I just have to clean up my blood.</i>

41:57.681 --> 42:00.059
<i>No, no, no!</i>
<i>That is my blood mixing with his.</i>

42:10.736 --> 42:13.239
<i> The robots are not our friends.</i>

42:13.906 --> 42:17.159
<i>This can still look</i>
<i>like an ill-conceived suicide.</i>

42:17.451 --> 42:20.412
<i>I just need to clean what got smeared</i>

42:21.205 --> 42:23.832
<i>while leaving the rest alone.</i>

42:45.145 --> 42:46.855
<i> I can still be good.</i>

42:46.939 --> 42:50.025
<i>Tonight was just a setback.</i>
<i>Everyone has setbacks.</i>

43:04.456 --> 43:05.541
<i>Okay, okay. Be cool.</i>

43:08.961 --> 43:12.006
-Is there a problem, officer?
-You were illegally crossing, sir.

43:13.674 --> 43:16.302
A little late
to be taking out the trash, huh?

43:19.346 --> 43:20.306
What's in the bag?

43:21.223 --> 43:23.475
Stuff... for Goodwill.

43:29.732 --> 43:32.192
<i> This is it, the end of our story.</i>

43:32.276 --> 43:36.071
<i>Hendy was right, I was delusional</i>
<i>to think love could save me.</i>

43:38.282 --> 43:39.116
What the...?

43:43.454 --> 43:44.788
These are limited edition.

43:46.874 --> 43:48.417
They're too... big.

43:49.627 --> 43:50.961
They're yours if you want 'em.

43:55.674 --> 43:56.675
All right, here.

43:56.759 --> 43:59.303
I was gonna write you up
for jaywalking, but, uh...

44:00.346 --> 44:01.180
you can go.

44:07.269 --> 44:09.355
<i> I've been spared.</i>

44:09.563 --> 44:12.608
<i>I've been saved,</i>
<i>and there has to be a reason for that.</i>

44:16.820 --> 44:18.906
<i> Maybe it's because Hendy was wrong.</i>

44:19.490 --> 44:23.494
<i>Love is real, and I have more to give.</i>

44:32.544 --> 44:34.588
Hey, man, uh, can I get a Texas Trio?

44:34.672 --> 44:37.132
And the bread, is that gluten-free?

44:37.216 --> 44:39.718
Do you have gluten-free bread?
Could you work that out for me?

44:39.802 --> 44:41.637
- Yeah, we got that. No problem.

44:42.429 --> 44:43.722
How are you, dude?

44:43.806 --> 44:46.433
Good. Just getting my grub on.

44:46.517 --> 44:47.726
Gonna go on a a diet for sure.

44:52.064 --> 44:54.191
<i> Maybe it's because I help people</i>

44:54.274 --> 44:56.276
<i>who need someone to look out for them.</i>

45:04.743 --> 45:05.661
<i>Growing up,</i>

45:06.328 --> 45:07.538
<i>I felt unsafe.</i>

45:08.497 --> 45:09.498
<i>Powerless.</i>

45:13.627 --> 45:14.628
I'm so sorry.

45:16.004 --> 45:17.423
You kept Mama's secret.

45:20.008 --> 45:21.552
Joey, you're such a good boy.

45:23.971 --> 45:25.806
Do you want to know another secret?

45:27.558 --> 45:28.809
One of these days...

45:29.601 --> 45:31.353
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

45:48.454 --> 45:49.997
All your fake passport stuff,

45:50.497 --> 45:51.498
everything you need.

45:53.167 --> 45:54.042
You're...

45:56.086 --> 45:57.212
letting me out?

45:57.296 --> 45:59.757
<i> This might be the dumbest mistake</i>
<i>I've ever made,</i>

45:59.840 --> 46:00.966
<i>but if Will's right,</i>

46:01.341 --> 46:03.677
<i>it's also the one thing that will prove...</i>

46:04.386 --> 46:05.596
<i>that I'm good.</i>

46:08.432 --> 46:09.308
I knew it.

46:11.935 --> 46:13.562
I knew you'd do the right thing.

46:56.313 --> 46:58.065
<i> I can rest now, Love,</i>

46:58.148 --> 46:59.942
<i>knowing I'm the man you want me to be</i>

47:00.025 --> 47:02.361
<i>and the bad is behind us.</i>

47:10.577 --> 47:13.372
-You ready?
<i>-</i>Yeah, but we need to buy another ticket.

47:13.747 --> 47:17.000
I met this, uh,
total smokeshow at breakfast.

47:17.084 --> 47:19.086
We were both reaching for the <i>queso,</i>

47:19.169 --> 47:20.295
and it was, like, this...

47:21.004 --> 47:22.881
insane destiny moment.

47:24.758 --> 47:25.634
That's not like you.

47:26.176 --> 47:27.594
I know. Um, I just...

47:28.053 --> 47:30.305
Look, I've never felt
like this before, okay?

47:30.389 --> 47:33.058
Just, like, instantly, like...
Oh, my God, there she is.

47:35.727 --> 47:36.603
You look amazing.

47:36.812 --> 47:38.981
Um, this-- this is my sister, Love.

47:41.108 --> 47:41.984
Hi.

47:42.317 --> 47:43.777
I'm Amy.
