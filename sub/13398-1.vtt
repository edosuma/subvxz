WEBVTT

03:53.442 --> 03:55.110
What happened?

03:56.362 --> 03:58.364
What happened?

04:29.520 --> 04:32.189
We'll kick their ass.
You'll see.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.028
You see?

05:22.654 --> 05:24.865
We're gonna get much more.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.590
This shitty thing...

07:22.067 --> 07:25.112
Fuck off, asshole.
Don't fuck around. Get in.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.197
Get in!

07:30.409 --> 07:32.870
You're just fucking around.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.626
You and your stupid shit.

07:40.961 --> 07:44.089
This piece of shit...

07:48.969 --> 07:50.429
There you go...

08:00.189 --> 08:02.400
Lemme see...

08:05.944 --> 08:07.946
Look how you left it, asshole.

08:10.532 --> 08:14.161
Wait, asshole... Wait.

08:18.161 --> 08:20.747
Let go, asshole.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.934
It's fucking warm, man.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.937
That it probably tastes like piss.

08:45.776 --> 08:47.653
"Pendejo" my balls, asshole.

08:52.655 --> 08:54.866
Oh really, asshole?
You gonna get tough?

09:00.624 --> 09:06.129
Wait, you sonofabitch.
Fucking asshole.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.841
You made me swallow dirt.
Fuck you, asshole.

09:11.677 --> 09:13.762
Son of a bitch.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.515
You're not gonna
help me carry them?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.393
Son of a bitch.

09:27.651 --> 09:33.490
Three days in Tucson.
Tucson, Tucson.

09:35.826 --> 09:38.328
Three days in Tucson.

09:39.413 --> 09:42.916
Three days with
a cousin in Tucson.

10:34.259 --> 10:40.432
Three days in Tucson.
With a cousin in Tucson.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.703
Morning. Mexican?

11:02.496 --> 11:03.705
Go ahead.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.332
Thanks.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.506
What's up, Bacacho?

11:12.506 --> 11:14.800
What's up, Arnulfo?

11:15.842 --> 11:17.635
Hey, Arnulfo.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.057
Hey.

11:23.725 --> 11:26.561
I used this trip
to bring it all over.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.605
Gimme the keys.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.526
You put them
in the Suburban.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.280
There was no one
at the checkpoint.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.366
- Any trouble?
- Nah, they didn't give a shit.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.244
Can I have a beer?

11:43.286 --> 11:47.249
- They didn't give a shit.
- Now you're gonna talk to el Capi.

11:49.084 --> 11:50.502
Sounds good.

11:50.502 --> 11:53.213
But I'm gonna need
a bigger truck.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.340
To move bigger
shipments, no?

11:55.924 --> 11:58.301
You only bring
what's yours.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.221
Right. Thanks.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.765
Any trouble you let us know.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.101
- Got it.
- Yes.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.258
Ready.

12:39.468 --> 12:42.179
- Great, thanks.
- Take care.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.908
Put it there.

13:07.579 --> 13:09.498
Pop those panels.

13:09.498 --> 13:12.375
- Can you or can't you?
- Yes, sir.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.045
And this guy?

13:16.296 --> 13:17.964
I don't know, man.

13:21.510 --> 13:24.471
It's got this hook
at the bottom. Push it.

13:24.679 --> 13:28.308
There you go.
One, two, three...

13:33.480 --> 13:35.357
Cool, huh?

13:44.695 --> 13:48.157
Fuck you. You take a shower.
You smell like feet.

13:56.211 --> 14:00.298
Don't do that again, asshole.
I can fuck you up.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.725
Watch out, asshole!

15:14.164 --> 15:17.667
Don't be sloppy, man.
Put up those seats.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.377
Yes, sir.

15:19.377 --> 15:22.339
- Are the hinges working?
- Yes, sir.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.966
Yes, sir...
Call me Capi, dude.

15:24.966 --> 15:26.426
What's up, man?

15:26.426 --> 15:28.470
What's up.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.722
Get here earlier,
and don't load so much.

15:30.722 --> 15:33.808
It still had room.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.852
Doesn't matter.

15:47.656 --> 15:49.241
- It's the last one?
- Yes.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.910
Bring that over here.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.456
Put it there.
There's still room.

16:36.955 --> 16:40.917
What you looking at, man?

17:10.280 --> 17:12.824
What you looking at?

17:14.367 --> 17:17.787
What you looking at, you fag?

17:19.539 --> 17:25.920
What, you wanna kiss me?
Huh?

17:26.129 --> 17:30.175
You wanna kiss me?

17:57.535 --> 18:01.456
He was playing cool
but he gave them his stereo...

18:01.456 --> 18:04.334
...so they wouldn't
tell his father.

18:04.334 --> 18:07.504
Whatever, asshole...

18:07.504 --> 18:09.964
You know what
they called him in school?

18:09.964 --> 18:11.925
The "micro" chip.

18:15.887 --> 18:18.306
- Let's dance.
- I don't like this song.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.307
Come on!

18:58.263 --> 19:02.017
- Can I see it?
- Yes, of course.

19:06.938 --> 19:09.858
- How much is it?
- Thirteen hundred.

19:15.864 --> 19:17.783
Hi uncle...

19:17.782 --> 19:19.659
I'm fine...

19:19.993 --> 19:22.954
I brought a
gift for my cousin...

19:26.749 --> 19:30.253
Nothing big, just a little gift...

19:36.759 --> 19:40.263
You just give the order
and it's done.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.891
Right?

20:27.352 --> 20:31.064
Hey, Bacacho.
How's it going?

20:31.856 --> 20:35.360
- Hello. Arnulfo.
- Nice to meet you.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.738
Martin's nephew.
He's working with el Capi.

20:39.030 --> 20:42.992
- What's up, Arnulfo?
- Nice to meet you, Gil.

20:43.076 --> 20:46.580
Just dropping by.
I brought a gift for my cousin.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.790
Thank you.
How's your mom?

20:48.790 --> 20:52.669
Good, good. Feeling better.
She sends her best.

20:52.669 --> 20:55.172
- Thanks.
- Yeah, all's good.

20:56.422 --> 21:00.301
Right, Bacacho? I dropped
another batch to el Capi.

21:00.301 --> 21:04.096
I'll do another run
by the end of the month.

21:04.514 --> 21:07.475
Fine. Go get
some food, son.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.644
Yes, yes.
Thanks... Thanks.

21:10.395 --> 21:13.857
Excuse me.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.194
What did you do, asshole?

31:47.489 --> 31:48.991
But...

32:22.066 --> 32:26.654
Hello... Is
Bacacho around?

32:27.905 --> 32:30.908
Do you know if
he took his phone?

32:32.076 --> 32:37.582
No, all good. I wanted
to ask him something.

32:40.334 --> 32:45.422
No, it's fine.
Ok. Take care.

32:46.799 --> 32:48.718
Motherfuck!

33:18.789 --> 33:21.125
Three days in Tucson...

33:45.399 --> 33:47.276
- Mexican?
- Yes.

33:47.276 --> 33:49.278
Passport?

33:53.699 --> 33:58.537
- How long were you out of the country?
- Three clays with a cousin in Tucson.

34:08.422 --> 34:10.424
Trunk.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.897
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

35:55.112 --> 35:56.322
Hey.

36:00.117 --> 36:01.660
Hey!

36:17.342 --> 36:19.845
- You have aspirins?
- Only acetlisal.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.847
- You want?
- Yes.

36:24.433 --> 36:26.435
Thanks.

36:37.196 --> 36:39.699
Give me your fucking number.

36:42.409 --> 36:43.493
Gimme your number!

36:48.874 --> 36:50.584
You're gonna call
and say you're ok.

36:51.752 --> 36:54.087
What do you mean "no" fucker?

36:56.796 --> 37:00.550
Don't lie. I saw the photo of
your fucking wife.

37:04.640 --> 37:07.143
Gimme the fucking number!

37:35.087 --> 37:36.588
What?

37:36.755 --> 37:40.008
Shut up, asshole.

37:59.486 --> 38:02.990
Hello? What's up, Capi?

38:04.574 --> 38:06.743
All good, all good.

38:07.369 --> 38:08.537
Oh, yes.

38:08.578 --> 38:11.957
Just wanted to tell you
we're on for the fifth.

38:12.666 --> 38:14.584
Cool.

38:15.335 --> 38:16.837
Bye.

38:31.685 --> 38:33.979
Move, asshole.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.983
There.

38:38.567 --> 38:40.569
Move it!

39:02.007 --> 39:03.800
What you looking at?

39:04.259 --> 39:05.719
You fag.

39:11.892 --> 39:14.186
Come on, move!

40:01.900 --> 40:04.653
How do you know about the milk?

40:09.199 --> 40:11.118
I'm talking to you.

41:55.972 --> 41:58.600
You with the DEA?

42:21.039 --> 42:22.791
You probably know, huh?

42:31.049 --> 42:33.051
Fuck!

42:38.138 --> 42:39.723
Shut up!

42:41.100 --> 42:41.809
Shut up!

42:41.809 --> 42:43.519
Shut up, asshole!

43:02.080 --> 43:04.082
Espera...

43:21.308 --> 43:24.311

- San Basilio.

43:25.228 --> 43:28.356
- Where you going?
- To Gómez Farías.

43:30.650 --> 43:33.320
- Get down.
- What?

43:33.445 --> 43:36.239
Get down, asshole.

43:37.866 --> 43:38.992
Topo!

43:40.035 --> 43:42.454
Check out what I found.

43:50.003 --> 43:52.589
Tell me, motherfucker,
what the hell is this?

43:52.589 --> 43:55.008
He's my partner. He had an
accident and I'm taking him...

43:55.008 --> 43:57.344
...to a hospital.

43:57.344 --> 43:59.012
You think I'm an asshole?

43:59.012 --> 44:01.014
Bro, this truck's tooled.

44:01.014 --> 44:02.807
Come here, motherfucker.

44:02.807 --> 44:04.517
Easy, easy, easy...

44:29.793 --> 44:30.752
Asshole?

44:57.654 --> 44:59.322
Checkpoint...

45:00.031 --> 45:02.450
A truck with a gringo
wants to pass...

45:04.244 --> 45:05.537
...check them out...

45:06.079 --> 45:07.580
...and let them pass...

45:08.748 --> 45:10.750
Move it.

47:07.492 --> 47:09.661
Don't play stupid.

48:46.966 --> 48:48.259
Fuck off.

49:40.561 --> 49:42.480
Who knows, man...

50:55.970 --> 50:58.139
What do you call them?

50:58.181 --> 51:00.100
The State finals.

52:30.356 --> 52:31.899
Fuck.

53:03.222 --> 53:03.931
Hello?

53:05.433 --> 53:07.560
What's up Bacacho?

53:07.602 --> 53:10.438
Yes, I just wanted
to talk to my uncle.

53:11.480 --> 53:13.440
To ask him a favor.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.445
Yeah.

53:17.862 --> 53:20.031
So I'll wait for your call.

53:20.281 --> 53:22.825
Got it, great. Bye.

53:33.753 --> 53:36.464
What's up, Cota?

53:37.465 --> 53:40.635
I know... But I need
to talk before you leave...

53:41.052 --> 53:42.887
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

53:43.679 --> 53:45.681
You still have the workshop?

53:48.267 --> 53:50.645
You think I can
crash there?

53:50.645 --> 53:54.440
Just to wait there until
I go see my uncle...

53:55.191 --> 53:56.943
In thirty minutes...

53:57.526 --> 53:59.445
Cool... thanks.

53:59.445 --> 54:01.364
Thanks, bro. Bye.

54:28.680 --> 54:31.183
Shut the fuck up.

55:01.465 --> 55:04.468
Keep him quiet. Manque
is upstairs with the baby.

55:04.468 --> 55:05.428
Ok.

55:41.005 --> 55:42.673
Here you go, dude.

55:45.926 --> 55:47.928
Don't lose the keys.

55:47.928 --> 55:48.763
Don't worry.

55:48.763 --> 55:50.765
Help me
put them on...

55:51.557 --> 55:53.976
Don't be a fag.
If you dragged him here...

55:53.976 --> 55:55.186
Do it yourself.

55:55.394 --> 55:57.104
Come on, help me.

55:58.647 --> 55:59.648
Give them to me...

56:08.282 --> 56:10.034
Aim at him.

56:14.622 --> 56:16.707
Let's see your hands.

56:26.801 --> 56:28.469
Easy there.

56:37.728 --> 56:39.313
There you go, Arni.

56:40.189 --> 56:41.482
Thanks, man.

56:43.734 --> 56:46.445
Manque made hotcakes.
If you're hungry.

56:46.570 --> 56:48.948
Yeah, thanks man.

57:01.127 --> 57:02.837
Let me see...

57:05.381 --> 57:09.886
Hi uncle...
All good... All good...

57:10.970 --> 57:13.723
Just wanted to say hi...

57:15.724 --> 57:19.811
To tell you about
an opportunity...

58:01.645 --> 58:05.065
Ok... We'll talk later.

58:05.900 --> 58:07.276
What's up, Arnulfo?

58:07.359 --> 58:09.278
Just passing by to say hello.

58:09.737 --> 58:11.655
You still owe Capi some stuff, no?

58:12.198 --> 58:15.534
Almost nothing.
It's all stored up.

58:17.661 --> 58:19.663
So why'd you come here?

58:19.997 --> 58:21.999
Just wanted to see my uncle.

58:23.250 --> 58:25.169
To ask a favor.

58:26.212 --> 58:28.214
And why don't you ask me?

58:28.214 --> 58:30.007
Because it's...

58:30.132 --> 58:31.926
It's a family thing.

58:32.134 --> 58:34.136
I won't take long.

58:39.934 --> 58:41.852
Someone's looking for you, Martin.

58:41.852 --> 58:43.562
Hello, uncle.

58:45.397 --> 58:47.399
What's up, Arnulfo?

58:48.734 --> 58:50.736
I just wanted to talk for a moment.

58:53.113 --> 58:55.574
You should be doing your thing, no?

58:55.616 --> 58:57.284
Yeah, right?

59:01.914 --> 59:03.916
What?

59:04.458 --> 59:06.460
Something wrong?

59:10.130 --> 59:11.423
So...?

59:15.135 --> 59:18.097
I've got something
that'll interest you.

59:21.225 --> 59:23.143
What?

59:32.152 --> 59:34.154
Come over here.

59:42.329 --> 59:44.790
Where were you
before coming here?

59:45.541 --> 59:47.543
I came straight here.

59:47.751 --> 59:49.712
Does your mother
know about this?

59:49.878 --> 59:51.213
No.

59:51.880 --> 59:54.967
- You see anyone else?
- No.

1:00:06.520 --> 1:00:08.772
What the fuck
are you thinking?

1:00:09.648 --> 1:00:12.067
Why the fuck did
you bring him here?

1:00:13.652 --> 1:00:17.906
He's got information.
I thought it could help you.

1:00:18.991 --> 1:00:23.037
You think we're all
fucking stupid?

1:00:23.078 --> 1:00:26.164
We're stupid, right?
And what about you?

1:00:26.165 --> 1:00:29.794
What about you and
your faggot shit?

1:00:31.462 --> 1:00:33.089
He's with the ATF.

1:00:33.130 --> 1:00:37.635
He knows all the names,
the routes, the shipments...

1:00:38.385 --> 1:00:42.556
Let's see what
your gringo knows.

1:00:48.520 --> 1:00:50.480
Bring him.

1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:16.442
Here he is.

1:02:35.127 --> 1:02:37.463
You know who I am?

1:02:39.256 --> 1:02:40.966
No?

1:02:42.134 --> 1:02:44.803
You sure?

1:02:45.721 --> 1:02:49.642
Didn't you know a lot?

1:02:50.184 --> 1:02:53.979
My nephew says
you know a lot.

1:02:54.354 --> 1:02:57.732
But you don't know anything.

1:02:58.025 --> 1:03:01.153
Are you a cop?

1:03:54.373 --> 1:03:56.625
Arnulfo...

1:03:56.792 --> 1:03:59.837
You're coming with
me to La Primavera.

1:03:59.837 --> 1:04:01.005
No, uncle.

1:04:01.129 --> 1:04:04.591
Come on, move.

1:05:18.749 --> 1:05:20.751
Give me the
handcuff keys.

1:05:46.193 --> 1:05:48.195
Let's do this fast.

1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:50.531
He's got information
that can help you.

1:05:50.530 --> 1:05:52.532
Fuck, come on!

1:05:54.701 --> 1:05:56.244
Come on...

1:05:56.703 --> 1:05:59.289
...you have to take him after.

1:06:03.210 --> 1:06:05.212
Grab it, goddamit.

1:06:15.722 --> 1:06:16.848
Go.

1:06:17.683 --> 1:06:21.019
What the fuck you mean, no?

1:06:22.896 --> 1:06:25.273
He can help. Gimme a
chance to take him.

1:06:25.273 --> 1:06:27.817
There's no
chance of shit.

1:06:28.026 --> 1:06:29.945
Go.

1:06:33.115 --> 1:06:34.408
What?

1:06:34.825 --> 1:06:36.869
You gonna cry?

1:06:38.829 --> 1:06:41.081
You gonna cry, asshole?

1:06:43.875 --> 1:06:45.877
Ok...

1:06:46.628 --> 1:06:49.256
...ok then.

1:06:52.676 --> 1:06:54.970
You're a faggot.

1:07:51.818 --> 1:07:53.820
I can't find the goddamn phone.

1:08:24.351 --> 1:08:25.936
Hi, mom.

1:08:26.311 --> 1:08:28.313
What are you doing
here, Arnulfo?

1:08:28.647 --> 1:08:30.649
We just had some trouble.

1:08:30.732 --> 1:08:33.985
- I just need to make a phone call.
- They called me, Arnulfo.

1:08:33.985 --> 1:08:35.987
They already called me.

1:08:38.907 --> 1:08:40.909
Everything's fine.

1:08:42.077 --> 1:08:44.037
My friend will help us.

1:08:44.037 --> 1:08:45.789
What friend?

1:08:46.581 --> 1:08:49.042
What the hell are
you thinking, Arnulfo?

1:08:49.084 --> 1:08:51.545
I don't want to hear him.

1:08:55.257 --> 1:08:58.886
Let me make a call,
they'll come for us.

1:08:59.469 --> 1:09:01.388
You can't be here.

1:09:01.513 --> 1:09:03.974
I can't have you
here when they come.

1:09:03.974 --> 1:09:04.892
Mom...

1:09:08.353 --> 1:09:10.105
I'm talking to you...

1:09:10.105 --> 1:09:11.398
Mom!

1:09:13.275 --> 1:09:16.069
So where should I go?

1:09:17.571 --> 1:09:21.075
I didn't want to leave
Colima but I came, right?

1:09:21.575 --> 1:09:24.286
I don't know,
but you fucked us.

1:09:26.079 --> 1:09:28.039
Here. Take this.

1:09:28.039 --> 1:09:31.918
Do what you have to do,
but you can't stay here.

1:09:40.844 --> 1:09:42.763
Fuck you, bitch!

1:10:08.955 --> 1:10:10.665
Hello, godfather...

1:10:11.333 --> 1:10:12.960
Yeah, all's good.

1:10:13.543 --> 1:10:15.545
Listen, can I come over?

1:10:16.630 --> 1:10:18.799
My mom's in Pericos...

1:10:19.716 --> 1:10:20.884
Yes, in about an hour.

1:10:53.166 --> 1:10:55.669
Your godmother went
to Marisela's house.

1:10:56.461 --> 1:10:58.964
She took dinner to the girls.

1:11:08.181 --> 1:11:09.641
Sit.

1:11:11.184 --> 1:11:13.436
- Yes, thanks.
- You ok?

1:11:13.561 --> 1:11:15.438
Yes, all's fine.

1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:16.606
You sure?

1:11:16.606 --> 1:11:20.985
They wanted to screw
us near Gómez Farías.

1:11:20.986 --> 1:11:23.697
Some assholes,
so we came down here.

1:11:24.781 --> 1:11:27.826
We're waiting for some
guys to go to Nogales.

1:11:28.034 --> 1:11:30.578
Why were you
by Gómez Farías?

1:11:31.454 --> 1:11:35.416
We were detoured there,
but I came from Peńitas.

1:11:36.209 --> 1:11:38.670
But everything's all right.

1:11:38.878 --> 1:11:40.922
Until it's not.

1:11:41.089 --> 1:11:42.591
And then?

1:11:43.091 --> 1:11:45.427
Let me get you
something to eat.

1:11:45.427 --> 1:11:47.971
- No need, it's fine.
- Hold on.

1:12:08.408 --> 1:12:09.993
Eat this.

1:12:10.243 --> 1:12:12.203
Thanks.

1:12:12.412 --> 1:12:14.414
So?

1:12:15.707 --> 1:12:17.584
You're going where?

1:12:18.376 --> 1:12:20.253
Nogales?

1:12:20.295 --> 1:12:23.548
Yes, we've got a
job over there.

1:12:23.798 --> 1:12:25.800
And then?

1:12:26.593 --> 1:12:29.763
I'm taking
off for a while.

1:12:43.443 --> 1:12:45.445
And this guy?

1:12:45.528 --> 1:12:46.821
He's my partner.

1:12:46.821 --> 1:12:48.865
He's working
with my uncle.

1:13:00.126 --> 1:13:01.669
Hello?

1:13:02.587 --> 1:13:03.963
Hello?

1:13:05.006 --> 1:13:07.008
Let me call
your godmother.

1:13:07.342 --> 1:13:09.344
See what time
she's back.

1:13:13.473 --> 1:13:15.600
What's up, honey?

1:13:16.768 --> 1:13:18.770
How are the girls?

1:13:21.147 --> 1:13:23.149
They eat dinner?

1:13:23.691 --> 1:13:25.693
You're kidding?

1:13:28.905 --> 1:13:30.698
Listen... Arnulfo is here.

1:13:30.740 --> 1:13:32.742
No, no, he's
almost leaving...

1:13:33.159 --> 1:13:35.120
Hold on.

1:13:45.046 --> 1:13:47.298
No, wait... wait.

1:14:27.213 --> 1:14:29.215
Go get the other one.

1:14:30.925 --> 1:14:34.220
You motherfucker.
What did you think?

1:14:34.220 --> 1:14:36.931
You would just
leave like that?

1:14:37.432 --> 1:14:39.559
Not here, Capi.

1:14:42.937 --> 1:14:44.939
Go get Roca.
