00:19.894 --> 00:21.062
<i>GENE: Hey,</i>

00:21.146 --> 00:24.065
check this out!
(undulating)

00:24.149 --> 00:25.650
That's... great. I think.

00:25.734 --> 00:26.943
Do you have a super fun hernia?

00:27.027 --> 00:29.029
It's a belly roll. Like belly dancers do.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.948
So put that down
as another career option for me.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.951
Mom, you're not looking.
(undulating)

00:35.035 --> 00:36.870
Sorry, honey. I'm trying to find my phone.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.038
TINA: Did you look in the bathroom?

00:38.121 --> 00:39.164
You usually bring it in there.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.874
It's not there. I already looked.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.084
I had to poop without it.
I read the back of the shampoo bottle,

00:43.168 --> 00:44.669
-like in the old days.
-(phone buzzes)

00:44.753 --> 00:47.756
Oh. Not to brag, but I just got
a text on <i>my</i> phone.

00:47.839 --> 00:48.965
That I didn't lose.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.091
Teddy's coming over.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.593
He's gonna help me
take down the vent hood,

00:51.676 --> 00:53.011
and then we're gonna go pick up
the new one.

00:53.094 --> 00:54.429
Ah, I love your life.

00:54.512 --> 00:56.264
I'll be back soon
so we can open for lunch.

00:56.348 --> 00:58.767
Okay. We should be back from
the shoe store by then, too.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.518
(singsongy):
And someone will have her new sneakers.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.688
-It's me!
-Aw, look at her poor toe poking out.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.065
LOUISE: She's going through shoe-berty.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.066
TINA: Say hi.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.359
-Hi!
-Dad?

01:07.442 --> 01:08.443
Oh. Hi?

01:08.526 --> 01:09.527
TINA: How are you?

01:09.611 --> 01:11.237
I, um... I'm fine.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.948
You know what, Mom, I'm gonna
have to pass on the shoe store.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.492
We only shop in the sales racks,

01:15.575 --> 01:17.410
and they're the saddest place
in the whole world.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.828
All those mismatched shoes

01:18.912 --> 01:20.372
staring up at you from the floor.

01:20.455 --> 01:23.124
One time, I found a bloody
Band-Aid in one of the shoes.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.459
Mom bought that pair.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.419
The Band-Aid wasn't that bloody.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.421
Dad, can I please go with you and Teddy?

01:28.505 --> 01:30.965
Sure. You want to go pick up
a new hood for a grill?

01:31.049 --> 01:32.550
Oh, you're seriously doing that?

01:32.634 --> 01:34.886
Ugh, still better than the sale racks.

01:34.969 --> 01:37.305
Huh.
Should I go with Mom or with Dad?

01:37.389 --> 01:38.890
It's a real <i>Kramer vs. Kramer.</i>

01:38.973 --> 01:40.558
Which I think was a <i>Seinfeld</i> episode.

01:40.642 --> 01:43.144
Well, pick someone,
'cause you're not staying here alone.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.146
And not because I don't want you
to find Mommy's special crackers

01:45.230 --> 01:47.148
that I don't really have.
Forget I said anything.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.651
Alone?
Gene can't be <i>anywhere </i>by himself.

01:49.734 --> 01:51.152
I beg your pardon?

01:51.236 --> 01:53.530
You still make Mom hide with you
when we play hide-and-seek.

01:53.613 --> 01:54.823
And you hate brushing your teeth
by yourself.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.032
That's why we do it together.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.951
We're the Supreme Court Brush-tices!

01:58.034 --> 01:59.953
And you get dressed
in our room every morning,

02:00.036 --> 02:01.496
even if we're still asleep.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.165
I change in your room because
sometimes Ken uses my room

02:04.249 --> 02:06.751
for his sunrise yoga class
that he substitute-teaches.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.378
I like Yoga Ken.
So flexible.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.213
-Ken's not real.
-If Ken's not real,

02:10.296 --> 02:12.465
then how did we FaceTime
for two hours last night?

02:12.549 --> 02:15.135
(sighs) Okay.
Uh, I'm going down to meet Teddy.

02:15.218 --> 02:17.387
-Wait for me.
-I'll stay here and do more of this.

02:18.888 --> 02:21.641
Where are you, you stupid,
stupid, stupid phone?!

02:21.725 --> 02:23.393
Maybe try talking a little nicer to it?

02:23.476 --> 02:24.436
Just a thought.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.646
(grunts) Okay.
We're getting there.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.148
-Keep holding it.
-(strained): Got it.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.150
(grunts) Thanks again
for helping out with this, Teddy.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.652
No prob, Bobby.
There's nowhere I'd rather be.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.112
Not even my cousin's wedding today.

02:34.195 --> 02:36.448
Wait, what?
Teddy, you didn't have to do this.

02:36.531 --> 02:39.075
It's fine.
It's just my mother's brother's son.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.369
So cocky 'cause he found true love.

02:41.453 --> 02:42.454
Anyway, today's about you.

02:42.537 --> 02:43.872
New hood, new life.

02:43.955 --> 02:44.873
Pretty exciting.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.082
Well, new to us.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.625
It's from a guy on a message board

02:47.709 --> 02:49.044
who's selling a refurbished one.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.296
It's way less expensive than a new hood.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.298
Oh. So you're buying another old hood.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.300
Well, it's not old-- it's refurbished.

02:55.383 --> 02:56.593
That's a fancy word for "old."

02:56.676 --> 02:59.346
So, you found this guy
on a message board, huh?

02:59.429 --> 03:01.598
Y-Yeah.
Why are you saying it like that?

03:01.681 --> 03:04.434
It's just... don't people
who post ads on the Internet

03:04.517 --> 03:07.437
turn out to be, you know,
psycho murderers?

03:07.520 --> 03:09.898
Eh. Some people just want
to sell you a pull-up bar,

03:09.981 --> 03:12.150
then be your friend and move in
with you for a while.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.651
I'm pretty sure this guy's legit.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.403
He sells a lot of refurbished appliances.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.072
-Old appliances.
-Besides,

03:17.155 --> 03:18.865
wouldn't it be the buyer who's the psycho,

03:18.948 --> 03:20.700
not the seller who gives you their address

03:20.784 --> 03:22.410
and trusts you to come to their home?

03:22.494 --> 03:24.746
Yeah, but what if their home
turns out to be a dungeon?

03:24.829 --> 03:27.415
Oh, yeah. What if their home
turns out to be a dungeon?

03:27.499 --> 03:29.834
Okay, guys, if their home is a dungeon,
we won't buy the hood.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.670
'Cause we'll be getting murdered
in the dungeon.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.672
Eh. I'm gonna miss you guys so much.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.215
But, Teddy, you'd be with us.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.383
We'd be together.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.467
No, I'd get away.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.510
Then I'd miss you so much.

03:38.593 --> 03:39.594
Well, if you get away,

03:39.678 --> 03:40.929
you can call the police.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.514
-Then you can save us.
-Eh.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.933
The guy'd probably kill you
before the police get there.

03:45.016 --> 03:45.975
But I could try.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.519
-Thanks, Teddy.
-GENE: Hey! Teddy!

03:47.602 --> 03:50.480
You haven't seen my cool
new trick yet, you lucky man.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.525
Oh, that's fun, Gene.

03:53.608 --> 03:54.943
It's like you swallowed a water bed.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.570
(scoffs)
Why are flecks of moisture hitting me?

03:57.654 --> 03:59.197
(strained):
Gene, we're... kind of busy at the moment.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.198
Oh, boo.

04:00.281 --> 04:01.866
-Okay. R-Ready, Bob?
-Yeah.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.035
-(strained): Oh, God.
-You said you were ready!

04:04.119 --> 04:06.621
I know, I did, I'm just...
(grunts) not strong.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.373
No, you are not.
No offense.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.708
(grunts)
None taken.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.459
Hmm.
Maybe I'll go with you guys.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.795
Teddy's got a truck,
and a truck trip could be fun.

04:13.878 --> 04:15.880
Although Mom likes to sing
while she drives,

04:15.964 --> 04:17.298
and I do enjoy that.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.676
A lot of swerving to the music,
honking to the beat.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.302
Will there be singing in the truck?

04:21.386 --> 04:22.846
-(grunting)
-I think it's gonna be a lot of this.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.180
BOB:
All right, let's put it against the wall.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.640
TEDDY:
Lea-Lean it this way.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.684
-The weight's all in the back.
-LOUISE: Just like Dad.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.728
Eh, I think I'm gonna
go with Mom and Tina.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.563
I just remembered
that the shoe store gives out

04:31.646 --> 04:33.648
free crushed pretzels on the floor.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.150
Ugh, where are you, phone?

04:35.233 --> 04:37.235
-Okay, it's ringing.
-Don't hear it.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.154
Don't hear it.
Don't hear it.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.656
Tina, honey, maybe you saying that
over and over again

04:41.740 --> 04:43.283
is gonna make it hard to hear the phone?

04:43.366 --> 04:45.952
I mean, I'm not questioning
<i>your</i> process, but okay.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.288
Wait till Mom and Tina hear the good news.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.290
Oh, before we leave,
I should probably get my Casio,

04:50.373 --> 04:53.293
grab my day planner, ooh,
and do one of those auto-reply

04:53.376 --> 04:55.045
"I'm out of the office" e-mails.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.629
Ugh, this isn't working.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.298
I don't know where my dumb phone is.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.133
Maybe you accidentally put it in a burger?

05:00.216 --> 05:02.469
No, I'm always really careful about that.

05:02.552 --> 05:03.553
Well, I guess we should leave

05:03.636 --> 05:05.013
if we want to get back before lunch.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.223
I can live without my phone
for a couple hours.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.143
I'll have to make real faces
instead of sending emojo-people.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.770
Wait, Gene's going with Dad, right?

05:11.853 --> 05:13.521
Yeah, I think so.
He went downstairs.

05:13.605 --> 05:16.649
If I find any shoe Band-Aids,
I'm not sharing them with him.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.235
Okay, let's head out so we can
be back in time for lunch.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.570
Wait, is Gene coming with us?

05:20.653 --> 05:22.572
No, he said he wanted
to go with Mom and Tina.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.366
Who's driving?
Oh, yeah. Me.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.409
And Robin goes in the back
on the way home.

05:26.493 --> 05:27.827
-Who's Robin?
-The hood.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.037
Dad, keep up.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.872
God, I'm trying to make this fun.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.457
I get it, I get it.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.584
Mom? Tina?
I'm going with you!

05:34.668 --> 05:36.586
I call the whole back seat
so I can do that thing

05:36.670 --> 05:37.629
where I pretend I'm in an Uber!

05:37.712 --> 05:39.172
Where are you guys?

05:39.255 --> 05:40.840
Hmm.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.553
Hello?

05:45.637 --> 05:47.555
Maybe they're doing a prank
I'm not enjoying.

05:47.639 --> 05:48.640
I'll go get the key.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.100
They're gonna get an earful!

05:50.183 --> 05:51.601
Dad?

05:51.685 --> 05:52.977
Louise?

05:53.061 --> 05:54.312
Huh.

05:54.396 --> 05:55.563
Hello?!

05:55.647 --> 05:57.065
Hello?

05:57.148 --> 05:59.234
Hello...!

05:59.317 --> 06:01.277
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

06:01.361 --> 06:03.697
Okay, okay. It's fine.
Everything's fine.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.281
I know what to do.
Call Mom.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.701
I know her number.
It's gonna be the first tattoo I get.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.160
-(phone buzzing)
-Wait, what?

06:09.244 --> 06:11.538
Why is the couch farting?

06:11.621 --> 06:13.164
Mom's phone?

06:13.248 --> 06:15.458
A nickel? A peanut M&amp;M?
(chewing)

06:15.542 --> 06:17.460
Okay, calling Dad.
What's Dad's number?

06:17.544 --> 06:19.212
I don't know it!
The digits were so random!

06:19.295 --> 06:21.256
Oh!
It's written on the fridge!

06:21.339 --> 06:23.258
Aah!
I can't read the last three numbers!

06:23.341 --> 06:25.677
They're smudged over
with some sort of sauce!

06:25.760 --> 06:27.012
Ketchup.
Figures.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.348
Aah! What do I do?!
What do I do...?!

06:33.685 --> 06:36.396
Guess I'd better get that.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.981
Hello?
Hi! Ken!

06:38.064 --> 06:39.899
I know you called me, but let me go first

06:39.983 --> 06:41.484
because you're not gonna believe this.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.486
I'm home alone!

06:45.572 --> 06:46.906
<i>GENE:</i>
<i>Yeah, no, that's right.</i>

06:46.990 --> 06:48.908
Mom and Tina were upstairs

06:48.992 --> 06:50.201
in the apartment and...

06:50.285 --> 06:51.953
Dad, Louise and Teddy
were in the restaurant.

06:52.037 --> 06:54.289
And then I guess
they didn't bother to make sure

06:54.372 --> 06:56.124
that their most special boy
in the whole wide world

06:56.207 --> 06:58.209
was with either of them when they left

06:58.293 --> 06:59.878
and drove out of my life forever!

06:59.961 --> 07:01.504
No, Ken, I will not calm down!

07:01.588 --> 07:02.922
<i>You</i> calm down!

07:03.006 --> 07:05.759
I know you're calm.
You're always calm, Mr. CBD Oil.

07:05.842 --> 07:08.261
Okay, okay.
Breathing, breathing.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.930
Thank you, Ken.
The beatboxing helps.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.432
(sighs)
Maybe you're right.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.267
Maybe I <i>should</i> look at this
as a good thing.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.811
I mean, I can do anything I want
right now.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.813
The apartment is my oyster!

07:18.897 --> 07:20.148
Oh.
Oyster sauce.

07:21.816 --> 07:24.319
The full-price section.
Hot damn.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.863
Don't look, Tina. Don't look.
We're not full-price people.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.698
Okay. So clean here.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.033
Tina, I said don't look.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.409
Keep moving, keep moving.

07:31.493 --> 07:32.952
And here we are.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.162
The sales racks!

07:34.245 --> 07:35.914
CHILD:
No, no, no, no, no!

07:35.997 --> 07:37.207
I don't want a shoe!

07:37.290 --> 07:38.708
No...!

07:38.792 --> 07:41.795
-No...!
-Hold my hand, honey. Stay close to me.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.464
Hi, are you Bob?

07:44.547 --> 07:47.092
Yeah... Yes, hi. Uh, this is Teddy
and my daughter Louise.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.510
Are you Adam?

07:48.593 --> 07:49.844
Yep.
Adam Appliances.

07:49.928 --> 07:52.138
That's a nickname
I'm trying to start for myself.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.598
-Because I sell appliances.
-Nice.

07:53.682 --> 07:54.683
Uh, well, so here's the hood.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.267
Feel free to check it out.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.602
Don't want you to think you're getting...

07:57.686 --> 07:58.853
hoodwinked.
(laughing)

08:00.772 --> 08:02.107
Oh, Adam Appliances.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.192
Huh. Great.
Uh, thanks.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.819
So, lot of merchandise, huh?

08:05.902 --> 08:07.570
There a lot of people coming in
and out of here?

08:07.654 --> 08:08.655
(chuckles)
That's right.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.365
-But are they, Adam?
-Are they what?

08:10.448 --> 08:11.950
Coming in <i>and</i> out?

08:12.033 --> 08:13.493
Louise.
Uh, sorry.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.704
She's, uh... gets excited around, um,

08:15.787 --> 08:18.289
refurbished restaurant supplies.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.375
This, uh, looks good.
All the right, uh,

08:20.458 --> 08:22.335
hood... parts.
We'll-we'll take it.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.587
Oh, great, great.
Well, water it once a week

08:24.671 --> 08:25.922
and give it lots of sunlight.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.467
-This guy. (sighs)
-Yeah, that's funny.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.636
Uh, so you posted
that you're selling it for $350?

08:31.720 --> 08:33.847
-Yep.
-All right. Here you go.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.766
Uh, it's a-a lot of singles and, um...

08:36.850 --> 08:39.394
uh, hold on-- some, um, loose change.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.896
Um, you-you can count it all out
if you like.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.441
Okay.
Guess we'll start with the pennies.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.942
One, two.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.027
This is a button.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.403
Oh. Sorry.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.155
<i>GENE:</i>
<i>Mom's special crackers!</i>

08:50.238 --> 08:52.198
Mom's special crackers! Yep,

08:52.282 --> 08:53.867
they were in her closet
in a shoebox labeled

08:53.950 --> 08:55.368
"Do not open.
Spiders."

08:55.452 --> 08:57.704
Now I want to know where
she keeps her spiders.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.123
Yeah, I'm sitting in their bed,
eating the crackers,

09:00.206 --> 09:01.958
'cause no one's here telling me not to.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.502
Okay, what should we do next?

09:04.586 --> 09:07.005
-(dance music playing)
-Take that, Louise's
"No Getting Out All My Collectibles

09:07.088 --> 09:08.923
and Having a Rave in My Room" rule!

09:09.007 --> 09:10.091
Yeah!

09:10.175 --> 09:11.217
"I had that dream again

09:11.301 --> 09:12.886
"where everyone's butts had eyebrows,

09:12.969 --> 09:14.763
and they called them 'thighbrows.'"

09:14.846 --> 09:16.097
And there's a drawing here.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.640
Want me to fax it to your secretary?

09:17.724 --> 09:19.351
(singsongy):
Holding all the spoons!

09:19.434 --> 09:20.894
Holding all the spoons!

09:20.977 --> 09:22.896
Holding all the spoons!

09:22.979 --> 09:26.107
Ooh, Tina!
I found one shoe that's in your size.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.902
-You want to try it on?
-Okay. Let's give this a shot.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.987
Feels good.
Maybe I don't need two shoes.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.405
(chuckles):
Who am I, Kate Middleton?

09:32.489 --> 09:35.116
Excuse me! Do you have
the other one of these sneakers?

09:35.200 --> 09:37.035
Everything we have is out here.
Sorry.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.204
But there was only one shoe in this box.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.456
(sighs): Yeah.
Shoes go missing all the time.

09:41.539 --> 09:44.459
People shove them in the wrong
box or just... throw them.

09:44.542 --> 09:45.835
I don't know why they do these things.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.879
I just try to get through each day.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.547
Ooh, look at those shooties.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.091
-What are shooties?
-You know,

09:51.174 --> 09:53.093
they're like if a shoe
and a boot had a baby.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.344
They're so cute.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.262
And it's so peaceful over there.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.098
And so... not sad.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.100
-And nobody's smoking.
-I'm gonna go try 'em on.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.560
Just for fun.
Nothing wrong with that, right?

10:02.644 --> 10:04.896
You want to go to the full-priced section?

10:04.979 --> 10:06.147
You want to go to the big show?

10:06.231 --> 10:07.732
Not to buy, just to try.

10:07.816 --> 10:08.733
You want to come?

10:08.817 --> 10:10.402
I sure as shootie want to come.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.320
Okay, Bob, you're all set.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.656
Unless you want to buy
a refurbished vacuum.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.409
-Oh, no, thanks.
-No, wait, wait, wait. L-Let me show you.

10:17.492 --> 10:18.743
-(loud whirring)
-So, it's kind of loud!

10:18.827 --> 10:20.120
Uh, but that's fine!

10:20.203 --> 10:22.580
You can scream and no one can hear it!

10:23.998 --> 10:24.916
-(whirring stops)
-See?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.376
Oh, yeah. I see.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.129
Oh, Adam, uh, can I get a receipt?
For my taxes.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.588
You know about taxes, Dad?

10:30.672 --> 10:32.424
-Um, kind of.
-Okay, sure.

10:32.507 --> 10:35.427
I'll get you a receipt.
I don't have any paper out here.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.178
Let me go inside and write you up one.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.930
-I'll be right back.
-Thanks.

10:39.014 --> 10:41.182
Feel free to look around.
That's a tortilla press.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.601
Or if you stick your hand in it,
it's a hand press.

10:43.685 --> 10:44.811
Hand-wich, anyone?

10:44.894 --> 10:47.230
(laughs)
Good one!

10:47.313 --> 10:48.440
Do we want to discuss the fact

10:48.523 --> 10:50.275
that he's talking about eating hands,

10:50.358 --> 10:53.278
and he basically gave us
a blueprint of his murder plan?

10:53.361 --> 10:54.863
What do you mean?

10:54.946 --> 10:58.116
The vacuum?
To cover up our screams? Hello?

10:58.199 --> 11:00.952
I think he was just trying
to sell us a really loud vacuum.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.579
I scream when I vacuum.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.205
But that's just 'cause
I don't like doing it.

11:06.458 --> 11:09.669
Yes, Ken, I <i>do</i> kind of feel like
the bartenders in <i>Coyote Ugly.</i>

11:09.753 --> 11:11.463
Hey, should I go in the kitchen?

11:11.546 --> 11:13.131
Yeah, I think I should, too.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.549
Hmm.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.426
Hamburger buns.
I'm gonna eat 'em.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.136
Oh, that's a much better idea.

11:18.219 --> 11:19.804
I should definitely put them
through the meat grinder

11:19.888 --> 11:21.556
and make bun-burgers.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.142
The burger is the bun,
and the bun is the bun. It's perfect!

11:24.225 --> 11:25.769
This is the kind of thing
Dad would never let me do,

11:25.852 --> 11:27.854
but once he tried it, he'd be like,

11:27.937 --> 11:29.647
"I love my brilliant bun son!"

11:31.483 --> 11:34.569
Huh.
That was a weird sound.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.738
Aah!
What the hell?!

11:36.821 --> 11:38.990
(groans)
I can't open the door!

11:39.074 --> 11:40.742
Help!
Ken, call the Coast Guard!

11:40.825 --> 11:42.452
Call the CSI basement people!

11:42.535 --> 11:44.287
Call Richard Belzer and Ice-T!

11:44.371 --> 11:46.956
Call Mariska Hargitay!

11:50.710 --> 11:52.045
The door's wedged shut!

11:52.128 --> 11:54.422
Yes, Ken, I <i>am</i> pushing with my core.

11:54.506 --> 11:56.800
Sorry, not all of us have time
to do Kundalini yoga

11:56.883 --> 11:58.093
for two hours every day!

11:58.176 --> 11:59.886
(sighs)
Looks like I'm stuck down here

11:59.969 --> 12:01.554
until Mom and Dad get back.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.306
At least I've got these buns
for nourishment.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.934
And all the basement food,
aka bottom snacks.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.811
Dad always tells me not to call them that.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.980
Taking a while for him
to write that receipt, huh?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.816
Maybe he's doing a pre-murder pep talk?

12:12.899 --> 12:14.609
-Psyching himself up?
-Louise.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.403
Ugh, we got to leave soon

12:16.486 --> 12:17.904
if we're gonna make it back before lunch.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.866
Adam?
Mister, um... Mr. Appliances?

12:21.950 --> 12:23.326
Should we just go?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.370
Uh, I kind of need that receipt.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.038
This hood is
a pretty big business expense,

12:27.122 --> 12:30.041
and I was gonna deduct it,
which I'm pretty sure is a thing.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.419
I bet he's in there right now
sharpening his gun.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.421
He's not a murderer, Louise.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.423
Hello? Adam?

12:36.506 --> 12:38.591
Okay, I guess I'm gonna go in?

12:38.675 --> 12:40.385
-You are?
-Yeah.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.429
-You stay out here.
-Oh, we stay out here? Really?

12:42.512 --> 12:44.556
-Why is that, Father?
-Just because.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.307
Because he might be a murderer.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.560
-No. Well, maybe.
-I'll go with you, Bob.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.562
Or, Teddy, you could go by yourself?

12:50.645 --> 12:51.771
No way, no.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.565
Okay, let's just all go in, then.

12:53.648 --> 12:55.692
Louise, stay behind me.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.110
Adam? Hello?

12:57.193 --> 12:58.820
Look at all that bleach.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.697
That stuff is great
for getting out bloodstains, right?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.115
Blood, sweat <i>and</i> tears.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.825
End of most days, I got all three.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.119
Wow. I love how it's two shoes that match.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.704
-I know, right?
-(whimpers)

13:07.787 --> 13:09.581
I feel like a New York businesswoman.

13:09.664 --> 13:11.666
Hey, Mr. Big Boss, I don't need this job.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.293
I'm gonna quit and move to Vermont

13:13.376 --> 13:14.878
and make baby applesauce.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.379
Hi, red carpet reporter.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.131
What am I wearing?
Two matching shoes.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.966
Oh.
You're over here now.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.635
Just so you know, moving shoes
from here to the sales rack

13:22.719 --> 13:24.387
doesn't magically make them on sale.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.556
You'd be surprised
how many people think that.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.476
No, no, no.
We're not doing that. We're just looking.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.353
Well, if you need any help, I'll be trying

13:31.436 --> 13:33.063
to take care of everything in the store

13:33.146 --> 13:35.190
-because they didn't hire enough people.
-Okay, bye.

13:35.273 --> 13:36.816
Come on.
Let's try on these cowboy boots.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.610
We can be cowgirl-businesswomen.

13:38.693 --> 13:41.363
We're gonna be yee-hot...
and good at our jobs.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.907
And that's why I think
ostriches should wear britches

13:43.990 --> 13:45.492
and be called "ost-britches."

13:45.575 --> 13:46.868
Ken, are you listening?

13:46.951 --> 13:48.828
Well, it just seems
like you're distracted.

13:48.912 --> 13:51.414
No, no, no, no, don't get off yet.
I want to keep talking.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.459
If you need to read your e-mail,
read your e-mail. I can wait.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.002
Oh.
You're reading it out loud.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.421
Wow.
So many e-mails from The Edge.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.256
How long have you known U2?

14:00.340 --> 14:02.634
You grew up with Larry Mullen Jr.?!

14:02.717 --> 14:04.427
Hello?

14:04.511 --> 14:08.014
Hello?
Um, we're in your kitchen now.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.975
Sorry to be... so in your house.

14:11.059 --> 14:14.521
But, uh, we're curious
how it's going with the receipt.

14:14.604 --> 14:17.190
I wonder which of our faces
he's going to wear as a mask.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.442
I don't know.
Could be a Goldilocks situation.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.445
-One's too big, one's too little.
-Mm.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.280
Gosh, you'd think

14:24.364 --> 14:26.408
Adam Appliances would have
some better ones in his own kitchen.

14:26.491 --> 14:29.953
A two-slice toaster?
What is this, 1985?

14:30.036 --> 14:32.706
Normally I'd hate
being left alone like this.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.874
You know, 'cause being
by myself isn't my thing.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.918
But at least I have you to talk to, Ken.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.420
What do mean you have to go?

14:38.503 --> 14:40.255
Your short film is winning an award

14:40.338 --> 14:41.840
at the Montreal Film Festival?

14:41.923 --> 14:43.299
Well, of course I'm happy for you.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.759
I know it's your passion project,

14:44.843 --> 14:46.302
and it took you forever
to clear the rights,

14:46.386 --> 14:48.013
and Jessica Chastain is a revelation,

14:48.096 --> 14:49.889
but I need you
to stay on the phone with me!

14:49.973 --> 14:51.933
Don't tell me I'll be fine!

14:52.017 --> 14:53.476
No! No!
Don't hang up!

14:53.560 --> 14:56.688
Ken? Ken?!
Hello? Ken!

14:59.733 --> 15:01.067
<i>GENE:</i>
<i>Pick up, pick up,</i>

15:01.151 --> 15:03.278
pick up.
Aah, voice mail again!

15:03.361 --> 15:05.196
Ken, I'm gonna keep leaving you messages

15:05.280 --> 15:07.782
because you hung up
and left me alone! Ugh!

15:07.866 --> 15:09.325
I hope that you go to a bagel store

15:09.409 --> 15:11.995
where they sell Montreal-style bagels,

15:12.078 --> 15:13.621
and they run out of them
right as you walk in.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.290
Sorry, I didn't mean that.
Goodbye. (grunts)

15:15.373 --> 15:19.085
Oh, no! Now how is Ken
supposed to call me back?!

15:19.169 --> 15:21.671
On a fork? That's ridiculous!

15:21.755 --> 15:24.341
Okay, Adam, we're in your living room now.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.051
Just really need that receipt, buddy.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.427
Wait. Are you holding a butter knife?

15:27.510 --> 15:29.637
-You butter believe it.
-Is it from Adam's kitchen?

15:29.721 --> 15:31.806
No, I walk around with butter knives.
Yes, of course.

15:31.890 --> 15:34.142
Teddy, are you holding a cheese grater?

15:34.225 --> 15:36.311
Yeah. Did you not grab anything
from the kitchen?

15:36.394 --> 15:38.438
(sighs) Okay, you know what?
This is too weird.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.231
Forget the receipt.
Probably better to live

15:40.315 --> 15:42.025
than to have a deduction.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.443
I think I read that on a fortune cookie.

15:43.526 --> 15:44.736
Come on, let's go.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.073
Oh, my God!
Please don't kill us!

15:48.156 --> 15:49.866
-What?!
-I'll grate you!

15:49.949 --> 15:52.577
Is that my cheese grater?
Wait. Is that my butter knife?

15:52.660 --> 15:55.580
Yes, and it's very serrated.
Are you sure it's a butter knife?

15:55.663 --> 15:57.248
Yeah, I should know that.
It is mine.

15:57.332 --> 15:59.668
-Why are you in my house?
-We were looking for you.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.920
You were taking so long
with the receipt, and we were...

16:02.003 --> 16:03.338
we weren't sure what to do.

16:03.421 --> 16:04.756
I had to go to the bathroom.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.174
We were shouting your name.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.093
The fan was on,
if you need to know everything.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.303
Ugh. This is exactly
what my wife said would happen

16:10.387 --> 16:11.971
if I started this business.

16:12.055 --> 16:13.807
You give strangers
from the Internet your address,

16:13.890 --> 16:15.183
and they'll come in your house

16:15.266 --> 16:17.185
and kill you with your own cheese grater.

16:17.268 --> 16:18.520
-No, I wasn't gonna kill you.
-No, Adam, no, no.

16:18.603 --> 16:19.813
-We're, we're not...
-I mean, it'd be hard with this.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.856
I knew there was something off
about you guys.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.441
You with all that change.

16:23.525 --> 16:25.568
Who would do something
like that to someone?

16:25.652 --> 16:29.322
I'm sorry. I-I mean, to be fair,
change is money.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.408
I know it's annoying money,
but it still counts.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.951
Dad, don't.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.577
Here is your receipt, sir.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.579
Uh, thanks.
We're gonna go now.

16:36.663 --> 16:37.914
Yeah, I think that's best you do.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.332
-Here.
-(shrieks)

16:39.416 --> 16:41.126
-Just put it on the table.
-Yup, yup, okay.

16:41.209 --> 16:45.213
Arr! Pirate and Go-Go Dancer
fight for the galaxy!

16:45.296 --> 16:47.298
-Arr!
-Groovy!

16:47.382 --> 16:49.759
So, are you guys sure
you don't need any help?

16:49.843 --> 16:52.429
Nope, nope.
Uh, ju-just making some decisions.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.888
Lot of boxes on the floor.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.265
We're gonna put them all back.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.558
Except for the ones that we buy.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.435
Uh-huh.
And how many pairs do you think

16:58.518 --> 16:59.978
you'll be purchasing today?

17:00.061 --> 17:02.230
I mean, uh,
maybe those sneakers over there?

17:02.313 --> 17:03.898
You know, when they go on sale.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.984
Are there some of these
I can start putting away?

17:06.067 --> 17:09.320
Uh, yeah, I guess the boots
and the... the moon shoes.

17:09.404 --> 17:10.822
And the gladiator sandals.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.657
Oh, and-and the moccasins, too.

17:12.741 --> 17:13.783
Those looked really good on you.

17:13.867 --> 17:14.826
They did, right?

17:14.909 --> 17:17.078
-Here, I-I'll put those away.
-Oh.

17:17.162 --> 17:20.040
Look, we're sorry.
It's just, we just wanted to know

17:20.123 --> 17:22.375
what it felt like to shop
in the nice shoe section.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.794
Where they have all the sizes
and the shoes come in pairs.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.796
And the lights aren't blinking
off and on over here.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.840
And there isn't anything
dripping from the ceiling.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.759
I get it. The sales racks are rough.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.927
I found a toe over there yesterday.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.138
-Oh, God.
-Ah, I think it was a toe.

17:35.221 --> 17:38.141
The police have it.
Anyway, I-I'll tell you what.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.976
I can give you 20% off those sneakers.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.394
-How about that?
-Really?!

17:41.478 --> 17:43.021
-Yeah.
-Thank you!

17:43.104 --> 17:44.773
-Sure.
-Or maybe I don't do the sneakers?

17:44.856 --> 17:46.900
I do the big boots,
and I'm Big Booty Tina from now on?

17:46.983 --> 17:49.194
-No, no, no, no, no, no, do the sneakers.
-Okay.

17:49.277 --> 17:52.697
Aah, I hate this!
No family, no Ken.

17:52.781 --> 17:55.492
Stuck here in the basement
with just myself.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.035
Why did Ken do this?!

17:57.118 --> 17:58.995
Why did my totally real friend
hang up on me?

17:59.079 --> 18:00.914
Doesn't he know
this is my worst nightmare?

18:00.997 --> 18:02.874
No one to talk to but myself?

18:02.957 --> 18:05.085
Wait.
Did Ken do this on purpose?

18:05.168 --> 18:08.171
Is this a test?
He does like to test me.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.923
Like that time he tested my self-control

18:10.006 --> 18:11.424
by asking me to hold his ice cream cone

18:11.508 --> 18:12.967
while he went to go poo poo.

18:13.051 --> 18:16.012
Maybe this is... a being-with-myself test.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.931
Okay, then, I'll try it.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.684
I'll try being alone with my thoughts?

19:16.322 --> 19:18.908
Ken, you brilliant son of a bitch!

19:18.992 --> 19:20.660
We're back!

19:20.744 --> 19:22.245
You might not recognize me
'cause of my new sneakers,

19:22.328 --> 19:24.497
but, um, it's me. Tina.

19:24.581 --> 19:27.584
Tina?! Oh, God, okay.
I'm glad you cleared that up.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.502
Look at that shiny new hood.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.671
It's refurbished.
Fancy word for old.

19:31.755 --> 19:34.799
Well, sorry we took so long.
We had a little shoe-cation.

19:34.883 --> 19:36.509
It's okay.
We took a while, too.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.595
We kind of mistook
a totally harmless person

19:38.678 --> 19:41.806
for being a murderer and then
we trespassed in his house.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.683
Sounds fun.
Hey, where's Gene?

19:43.767 --> 19:45.727
-I thought he was with you.
-I thought he was with you!

19:45.810 --> 19:47.729
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

19:47.812 --> 19:49.731
ALL:
Gene?! Gene?!

19:49.814 --> 19:50.982
My toys!

19:51.066 --> 19:52.067
My diary!

19:52.150 --> 19:53.568
My crackers!

19:55.904 --> 19:57.614
-♪ <i>Bun-burger.</i> ♪
-He's here!

19:57.697 --> 19:59.324
-Gene!
-Mom! Dad!

19:59.407 --> 20:01.409
Oh, we're so sorry, Gene.

20:01.493 --> 20:03.161
We didn't mean to leave you by yourself.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.579
I thought you were with your dad.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.331
And I thought you were with your mom.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.333
Are you all right?
We know you don't love being alone.

20:08.416 --> 20:09.668
Or being trapped in a basement.

20:09.751 --> 20:11.503
<i>We</i> were almost trapped in a basement.

20:11.586 --> 20:12.671
Yeah, we almost died.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.631
No, we weren't, and no, we didn't.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.049
You know, it actually wasn't that bad.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.634
I had Ken for a lot of it.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.303
But then he had to go accept this award,
and I was alone,

20:20.387 --> 20:22.305
but that turned out to be okay, too.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.933
Really?
That's, uh... that's good.

20:25.016 --> 20:26.643
Uh, what's going on with the meat grinder?

20:26.726 --> 20:28.144
Big changes at the restaurant, Dad.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.646
I don't want to give it away,

20:29.729 --> 20:31.731
but let's just say
it rhymes with "dun durgers."

20:31.815 --> 20:34.317
Oh, my Geenie Weenie, Mommy's so sorry!

20:34.401 --> 20:36.277
Mwah-mwah-mwah!
Mwah! Mwah-mwah-mwah!

20:36.361 --> 20:37.654
It's okay, Mom.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.698
Huh. You're kind of
letting them off pretty easy.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.825
I would maybe look
for a lawyer if I were you?

20:41.908 --> 20:44.285
No lawyers.
Come on. Let's go upstairs.

20:44.369 --> 20:46.329
So, you found my special crackers, huh?

20:46.413 --> 20:48.707
-Yup. Ken and I did.
-How is Ken?

20:48.790 --> 20:50.834
GENE:
Busy as always. And he's microdosing.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.669
That's... You know what?

20:52.752 --> 20:55.839
<i>Just tell him thanks</i>
<i>for keeping you company.</i>
