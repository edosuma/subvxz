00:01.968 --> 00:04.470
I hear spirits talking to me.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.338
I get anger.

00:06.339 --> 00:09.025
Like, it's, like,
explosive anger.

00:09.060 --> 00:11.711
The whole house
started up shaking.

00:11.746 --> 00:13.444
My God.

00:13.479 --> 00:16.379
I'm sorry.

00:16.415 --> 00:18.116
Something's upstairs
moving around.

00:18.117 --> 00:20.286
You don't have to bury
three of your children.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.352
Who does that?

00:21.387 --> 00:23.456
<i> I'm right here.</i>

00:23.491 --> 00:25.525
"I'm right here."

00:25.560 --> 00:26.558
What about us?

00:26.593 --> 00:29.195
Are you nervous being here?

00:29.230 --> 00:31.763
Obviously, move cautiously.

00:31.798 --> 00:35.167
When the dead are
forgotten, they become restless.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.536
My God!
Did you just touch me?

00:36.571 --> 00:37.770
What?!
I did not touch you.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.370
I'm Amy Bruni.

00:39.405 --> 00:42.273
A haunting encounter
redefined my life.

00:42.308 --> 00:45.878
I live with that experience
and seek answers to the unknown.

00:45.913 --> 00:47.647
It says I am!

00:47.682 --> 00:49.347
I'm Adam Berry.

00:49.382 --> 00:52.650
At Gettysburg, the shadows
and screams of dead soldiers

00:52.651 --> 00:54.988
turned me into
a supernatural believer.

00:55.023 --> 00:56.487
My God!

00:56.522 --> 00:58.357
Together,
our investigations

00:58.392 --> 01:00.024
bring peace to the living.

01:00.059 --> 01:01.961
You can't scare us.
You can't deter us.

01:01.996 --> 01:03.863
By giving a voice
to the dead.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.565
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.765
What is your name?

01:06.766 --> 01:08.233
Because we believe
the dead

01:08.268 --> 01:11.904
and the living are all...

01:18.744 --> 01:21.080
The case we're headed
to right now, Sharon called.

01:21.115 --> 01:22.646
She is the mom.

01:22.681 --> 01:24.148
So what does she do?

01:24.183 --> 01:26.452
She's a stay-at-home mom
who retired from the military

01:26.487 --> 01:28.420
and is living off her
full pension.

01:28.421 --> 01:31.389
She has two kids
living with her --

01:31.424 --> 01:36.595
her 20-year-old daughter, Anna,
and her 11-year-old son, Brady.

01:36.630 --> 01:41.434
And Sharon has experienced
unimaginable loss in her life.

01:41.469 --> 01:44.904
Two years ago,
her daughter died.

01:44.939 --> 01:47.938
Prior to that, her son died,

01:47.973 --> 01:53.545
and prior to that she lost
a daughter in childbirth,

01:53.546 --> 01:57.082
so she has lost
three children.

01:58.651 --> 02:03.122
And she thinks that she has
some sort of dark attachment,

02:03.157 --> 02:05.258
and she thinks this attachment
had something to do

02:05.293 --> 02:06.692
with the deaths
of her children.

02:11.663 --> 02:15.400
So now, she is terrified for her
remaining two children.

02:15.435 --> 02:19.138
She thinks that whatever
did this could come for them,

02:19.173 --> 02:21.305
and there's activity
all the time.

02:21.340 --> 02:23.309
She's just always wondering,
"When is the next one?

02:23.344 --> 02:24.875
What's gonna happen next?"

02:24.910 --> 02:27.046
- I would be terrified, as well.
- Of course.

02:27.081 --> 02:30.783
I mean, this is a family
in crisis.

02:30.818 --> 02:35.353
I got the chills.

02:35.354 --> 02:36.755
- Hey, Sharon.
- Hello. How are you doing?

02:36.790 --> 02:43.995
- Very good.
- We're doing good.

02:43.996 --> 02:45.430
- It seemed pretty urgent --
- Yes.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.133
...so what's going on?

02:47.168 --> 02:48.766
I'm scared for my kids.

02:48.801 --> 02:51.203
There's something going
on here.

02:51.204 --> 02:54.240
In this area here,
we get a lot of orbs.

02:54.275 --> 02:57.276
So you're actually seeing
physical orbs

02:57.311 --> 02:58.410
go through the air?
- Yes, yes.

02:58.445 --> 02:59.912
Wow.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.682
Seeing a visual anomaly
with the naked eye is very rare.

03:02.717 --> 03:05.551
That means whatever is here
wants to get their attention,

03:05.586 --> 03:08.154
and it's strong enough
to do it.

03:08.189 --> 03:09.520
Where does it come from?

03:09.555 --> 03:11.791
It seems like they always
come from that area.

03:11.826 --> 03:12.859
- And come this way?
- Yes.

03:12.894 --> 03:14.058
Okay.

03:14.093 --> 03:15.862
And it might have something
to do with...

03:20.332 --> 03:22.066
How did Miranda pass?

03:22.101 --> 03:25.438
She was run off the road
by an aggressive driver

03:25.473 --> 03:27.957
in a car accident
on Route 72, so...

03:27.992 --> 03:30.442
So did that start happening

03:30.477 --> 03:32.178
about the time
when this happened?

03:32.213 --> 03:33.544
The orbs did, yes.

03:33.579 --> 03:35.113
- Okay.
- Yes, the orbs.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.748
Okay.
But there was always activity?

03:36.783 --> 03:39.518
Yes, there has always
been activity in the house,

03:39.553 --> 03:42.254
and right over here
I've got the tapping noises.

03:42.289 --> 03:46.424
Tap, tap.

03:46.425 --> 03:48.327
And that's what makes me think,
like, okay, you know,

03:48.362 --> 03:51.297
there's something
more going on,

03:51.332 --> 03:54.198
because there was more tapping.

03:54.233 --> 03:57.336
You hear footsteps, like,
someone almost, like, stomping.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.404
- Really?
- Yes.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.804
Okay.

03:59.839 --> 04:01.807
I always try and figure,
"How can I explain this away?"

04:01.842 --> 04:04.143
Because I try to keep in
on the down low so my boy

04:04.178 --> 04:06.044
doesn't get so scared
all the time.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.413
- And what's his name?
- Brady.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.816
- Brady, okay.
- Okay.

04:09.851 --> 04:10.848
Good.

04:10.883 --> 04:12.552
And this is Brady's room.

04:12.587 --> 04:14.085
Okay.

04:14.086 --> 04:16.755
So a lot of the activity is
happening really near his room.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.822
Yes, and he gets very scared,

04:19.858 --> 04:23.045
and he said he saw
a shadow figure.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.657
How long has that
been going on?

04:25.692 --> 04:28.234
Since my son Tanner
passed away.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.600
It freaked him out so much.

04:29.635 --> 04:32.938
What happened, exactly,
with Tanner?

04:32.973 --> 04:36.241
Tanner was driving
to work one morning,

04:36.242 --> 04:38.693
and he got in an accident --

04:38.728 --> 04:41.145
...and he had a very major
head trauma,

04:41.146 --> 04:44.283
but he remained in a coma
for two years before he passed.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.350
Wow.

04:46.385 --> 04:49.905
So what was Tanner's
relation to Brady?

04:49.940 --> 04:53.391
- That was his big brother,
you know? - Right.

04:53.426 --> 04:54.493
- That was --
- Yeah.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.494
That's so sweet.

04:56.529 --> 05:00.032
How old was Brady when
Tanner passed away?

05:00.067 --> 05:01.098
-6.
-6.

05:01.133 --> 05:02.533
- Okay.
- Yes.

05:02.568 --> 05:04.135
And he still remembers him
quite a bit, I'm sure.

05:04.136 --> 05:06.338
Of course, of course, and then
have to go through it again

05:06.373 --> 05:07.505
with Miranda, you know.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.374
- The poor guy.
- And you, too.

05:09.409 --> 05:11.143
I'm so sorry.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.843
Well, I'm sorry.

05:12.878 --> 05:15.146
- I know it's painful to talk about that.
- It's all right.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.748
So where was the shadow
exactly?

05:16.783 --> 05:18.316
You would have to ask him that.

05:18.317 --> 05:21.020
- Okay.
- I think we will talk to Brady.

05:21.055 --> 05:23.940
Right.

05:26.826 --> 05:32.064
So your mom told us that
you saw a shadow in here.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.497
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:33.532 --> 05:35.366
Do you want to tell us
about it?

05:35.367 --> 05:38.571
I usually see, like, shadows
in my room sometimes,

05:38.606 --> 05:42.775
and they, like,
usually come past my door,

05:42.810 --> 05:44.542
so that's how I see them.

05:44.543 --> 05:47.845
- Do they look like a person?
- No.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.616
They normally are like
this high off the ground.

05:50.651 --> 05:51.784
They're small?

05:51.819 --> 05:54.218
- Yes.
- Okay.

05:54.253 --> 05:56.121
To me, I'm afraid
of the dark, so...

05:56.156 --> 05:58.323
Why are you afraid of it?

05:58.324 --> 06:00.959
I heard spirits talking to me.

06:00.994 --> 06:01.992
Okay.

06:02.027 --> 06:03.228
And who was talking
to you?

06:03.263 --> 06:04.294
I'm not sure.

06:04.329 --> 06:05.930
And what were they saying?

06:05.965 --> 06:07.132
They were saying, like,
"Hello,"

06:07.167 --> 06:08.299
and "I love you"
and all of that.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.434
- They were?
- Yeah.

06:10.469 --> 06:12.569
- And I was saying, like,
"Stop. You're scaring me." -

06:12.604 --> 06:15.774
And then I never heard
the voices again.

06:15.809 --> 06:19.543
- That must have been scary.
- Yeah.

06:19.578 --> 06:23.315
So what could we do for you
to make you feel safer?

06:23.350 --> 06:27.752
What do you want us to do?

06:27.787 --> 06:31.791
Maybe find out that there's,
like, nothing to worry about?

06:34.092 --> 06:36.762
Anything else we should know
about the house?

06:40.032 --> 06:43.301
I know my sister has had, like,

06:43.302 --> 06:45.788
a few experiences
in her room.

06:45.823 --> 06:48.274
And that's downstairs,
right?

06:48.309 --> 06:50.343
- Yeah.
- And that's Anna?

06:50.378 --> 06:53.244
- Is that Anna?
- Yes.

06:53.279 --> 06:56.015
Have you had anything
happen down here?

06:56.050 --> 06:57.514
I have.

06:57.549 --> 07:00.152
This is actually the only place
I've ever heard a voice.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.521
- Really?
- Yes.

07:01.556 --> 07:02.820
It was saying my name,

07:02.855 --> 07:04.523
and then saying the words,
"Help me."

07:04.558 --> 07:06.676
Okay, and when does it happen?

07:06.711 --> 07:08.759
Did it only happen
that one time?

07:08.794 --> 07:12.597
That's the only time I've heard,
you know, a sentence.

07:12.598 --> 07:15.567
There's been other times,
but nothing like that.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.537
What's your biggest area
of concern in the house?

07:18.572 --> 07:21.405
- Definitely that spare room.
- Upstairs?

07:21.440 --> 07:24.175
Yes, just because when Miranda
was living here

07:24.210 --> 07:27.746
she kind of stressed it to us,
"I don't want to be in there."

07:27.747 --> 07:30.080
That was supposed to be her room --

07:30.115 --> 07:32.918
...and knowing that there
might be something here

07:32.953 --> 07:36.055
that she was afraid of
is what concerns me.

07:36.090 --> 07:38.822
- Okay.
- Yeah.

07:38.857 --> 07:42.461
This is the room that no one
wants to stay in, nobody.

07:42.496 --> 07:45.663
Never feels right in here.

07:45.698 --> 07:48.933
I don't think we've had any
actual activity in this room,

07:48.934 --> 07:51.835
it's just
the feeling you get.

07:51.870 --> 07:54.306
Before Miranda passed
and I was feeling good,

07:54.341 --> 07:56.241
and then something
just was like,

07:56.242 --> 07:59.009
"Just you wait,"

07:59.044 --> 08:01.246
and it was in this room
that had happened, so...

08:01.281 --> 08:03.413
Did you hear something say,
"Just you wait."

08:03.448 --> 08:07.453
I didn't actually hear it.
It was, like, a thought.

08:07.488 --> 08:08.453
- Right.
- I get it, like an impression.

08:08.454 --> 08:09.754
- Right, right.
- Yes.

08:09.789 --> 08:11.121
Like something went in my head
and be like,

08:11.156 --> 08:13.742
"Okay. Wait and see."
- What did you think that was?

08:13.777 --> 08:16.328
A spirit attachment I think
I've had since childhood.

08:16.363 --> 08:17.494
- Really?
- Yes.

08:17.529 --> 08:18.896
What makes you think that?

08:18.931 --> 08:21.599
When we were kids,
there was a place

08:21.600 --> 08:24.702
called the Uplands
in New Jersey.

08:24.737 --> 08:27.673
My sister Penny and I
weren't supposed to go up there,

08:27.708 --> 08:29.974
but we went up
and we found a house.

08:30.009 --> 08:33.345
In the upstairs was a dirty
mattress with blood on it,

08:33.380 --> 08:35.714
and the downstairs
there was a pentagram,

08:35.749 --> 08:37.014
so my sister Penny and I,

08:37.049 --> 08:40.953
we took vines and sticks
and we made crosses

08:40.988 --> 08:42.889
and we stuck them
all around the house,

08:42.924 --> 08:44.755
and then when we put
the last one in,

08:44.790 --> 08:47.726
the whole house started to shake
and we just took off.

08:47.761 --> 08:50.662
So was it pretty well-known
for people going up there

08:50.697 --> 08:52.381
and doing rituals and things?

08:52.416 --> 08:54.031
Yes. Back in the '80s, yes.

08:54.066 --> 08:56.068
They were worshipping
the devil on the property.

08:56.103 --> 08:59.570
Yes.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.739
And did things start to happen
after that,

09:01.774 --> 09:04.810
that made you think something
was attached to you from there?

09:04.845 --> 09:07.644
- I mean, bad things happen
to everybody, but not like me. - Yeah.

09:07.679 --> 09:10.549
You don't have to bury three
of your children, you know?

09:10.584 --> 09:12.050
- Who does that?
- Right.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.535
All in October.

09:13.570 --> 09:14.945
- Really?
- Yes.

09:14.980 --> 09:16.321
It's almost October.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.521
I know, I know.

09:17.556 --> 09:19.525
- So do you get, like, anxiety --
- Yes.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.494
- ...when October comes?
- Very bad. Very bad.

09:21.529 --> 09:23.329
Every --
It seems like October comes

09:23.364 --> 09:25.130
and something
gets taken from me.

09:32.638 --> 09:35.774
I mean, with this case
there's a real sense of urgency.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.374
There's been a lot of tragedy
in the family.

09:37.409 --> 09:40.145
They're experiencing a lot
of terrifying activity,

09:40.180 --> 09:42.212
so I think Adam and I
both right now,

09:42.247 --> 09:44.382
we just feel like we need
to get them some answers,

09:44.383 --> 09:46.016
but there's just so much
going on

09:46.051 --> 09:48.418
it's hard to figure out
where to even begin,

09:48.453 --> 09:51.622
and we have to hurry because
October is only three days away.

09:55.093 --> 09:56.127
It's so urgent.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.828
- Like, we have to fix it.
- Yeah.

09:57.863 --> 09:59.798
I'm glad Sharon and the kids
agreed to stay with friends

09:59.833 --> 10:02.099
while we figure this out.
- Yeah.

10:02.134 --> 10:05.737
We have Sharon with some sort
of dark attachment.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.171
That's the biggest thing.

10:07.172 --> 10:08.839
What is this New Jersey thing?

10:08.874 --> 10:11.143
But I also feel like there
are so many other things

10:11.178 --> 10:13.412
that could be going on here
because we have a voice

10:13.447 --> 10:16.647
in Brady's ear,
and they seem like

10:16.682 --> 10:20.002
they are voices of family
who have passed away.

10:20.037 --> 10:23.230
Yes, but you have
shadow figures in his room.

10:23.265 --> 10:26.389
You have a voice saying,
"Help me" to Anna.

10:26.424 --> 10:29.461
Like, is the thing in the house
causing these deaths?

10:29.496 --> 10:31.562
Yeah. What about us?

10:31.597 --> 10:33.682
Are you nervous being here?

10:33.717 --> 10:35.767
Obviously, move cautiously.

10:39.905 --> 10:42.072
- Let's get into Brady's room now.
- Yeah.

10:42.107 --> 10:44.242
I think he seems
the most affected.

10:44.243 --> 10:47.095
Yeah.
We should use the SLS camera...

10:47.130 --> 10:49.913
...because he saw
a shadow in there. - Right.

10:49.948 --> 10:53.001
The SLS camera has
two lenses and infrared light,

10:53.036 --> 10:56.055
which allows us to see things
not visible to the naked eye.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.589
We are also using a recorder

10:57.590 --> 11:00.191
to capture any
electronic voice phenomenon,

11:00.226 --> 11:02.659
but if they can't talk to us
we have flashlights,

11:02.694 --> 11:05.164
which allow entities to
communicate with us physically.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.136
Let's start the EVP session
and try to communicate

11:11.171 --> 11:13.704
with the entity
that's speaking to Brady.

11:13.705 --> 11:17.726
So we're friends of Brady's,
and he seems to think

11:17.761 --> 11:21.747
that sometimes there's someone
else in here with him,

11:21.782 --> 11:24.181
so if there is
someone else in here,

11:24.216 --> 11:26.118
can you light up
one of those flashlights?

11:29.455 --> 11:33.158
He says that sometimes
he sees a little shadow.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.491
Are you in here?

11:34.526 --> 11:36.929
Do you mean to scare
anyone here?

11:43.201 --> 11:44.903
Are you related to Brady?

11:46.000 --> 11:52.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

12:02.054 --> 12:05.790
Maybe if we call Chip
he can do a walk-through.

12:05.791 --> 12:07.457
Whoever's inside of
my head says,

12:07.492 --> 12:11.063
"You finally gave me
a place to live."

12:24.388 --> 12:26.240
We're in Willington,
Connecticut,

12:26.275 --> 12:28.092
in an urgent race
against the calendar.

12:28.127 --> 12:29.625
Sharon believes a dark entity

12:29.660 --> 12:32.764
took three of her children's
lives, all in October.

12:32.799 --> 12:34.064
She's worried that when
the tragic month

12:34.099 --> 12:35.834
arrives in three days
something could hurt her

12:35.869 --> 12:38.401
two living children,
Anna and Brady.

12:38.402 --> 12:41.172
We've started our investigation
in Brady's room.

12:47.912 --> 12:49.964
It was a, "No."

12:49.999 --> 12:51.981
It's weird.

12:52.016 --> 12:54.886
Can you reach in there and turn
on one of those flashlights?

12:59.023 --> 13:00.156
- I mean, nothing.
- No.

13:00.191 --> 13:02.760
It's not even moving.
It's not coming on.

13:02.795 --> 13:05.294
Amy and I came into
this investigation

13:05.329 --> 13:08.233
wanting to know who
or what is haunting this home.

13:08.268 --> 13:11.067
The voice on the EVP claims
not to be family,

13:11.102 --> 13:13.738
but whatever it is has stopped
communicating for the moment.

13:17.909 --> 13:20.628
Maybe if we call Chip --

13:20.663 --> 13:22.656
...and see
if he can do a walk-through.

13:22.691 --> 13:24.604
We won't tell him anything.

13:24.639 --> 13:27.029
We'll just bring him
in totally cold...

13:27.064 --> 13:29.385
...and see if he picks up on any of this --
- Right.

13:29.420 --> 13:31.421
...because if it's as strong
of an entity

13:31.422 --> 13:34.323
as Sharon seems to think it is,

13:34.358 --> 13:37.226
he should be able to kind of
hone in on that. - Right.

13:37.261 --> 13:39.997
Let's give him a call and see
if he can get here.

13:40.032 --> 13:42.164
Okay.

13:42.199 --> 13:44.435
There could be multiple entities
haunting this family,

13:44.470 --> 13:46.102
and we need to narrow it down.

13:46.137 --> 13:48.805
Chip Coffey,
a world-famous psychic medium,

13:48.806 --> 13:51.576
can give us insight
that our equipment can't.

14:02.220 --> 14:07.191
- Is he here?
- Are you guys ready?

14:15.300 --> 14:17.734
- We purposely didn't tell you
anything about the house... - No.

14:17.769 --> 14:20.271
...the family, nothing.

14:20.306 --> 14:21.771
What's the three?

14:21.772 --> 14:22.907
Are there three people
in the house?

14:27.078 --> 14:28.711
Yes, there's three.

14:28.746 --> 14:31.281
So there are three people alive
in this house.

14:31.282 --> 14:34.185
I think there are
three dead, too.

14:34.220 --> 14:36.953
Okay.

14:36.988 --> 14:38.256
Let's go this way.

14:44.862 --> 14:46.529
I get anger.

14:46.564 --> 14:48.130
Like,
it's like explosive anger,

14:48.165 --> 14:50.668
and I'm getting so pissed off,
and I don't know --

14:50.703 --> 14:52.067
Why am I getting pissed off?

14:52.102 --> 14:54.071
I don't understand why
I'm getting pissed off.

14:54.106 --> 14:55.638
I'm getting pissed off.

14:55.673 --> 14:58.809
So there's some anger issues
in this house

14:58.844 --> 15:01.945
that may have been
elevating or escalating,

15:01.946 --> 15:04.249
or not being managed well.

15:04.284 --> 15:07.202
Um...

15:10.121 --> 15:13.174
Whoever is inside
of my head says,

15:13.209 --> 15:16.192
- "You finally gave me
a place to live." -.

15:16.227 --> 15:19.130
"You finally gave me
a place to live."

15:19.165 --> 15:22.665
Okay.

15:22.700 --> 15:26.035
- There's a woman involved --
- Yeah.

15:26.070 --> 15:28.840
...and whatever is talking
to me in my head says,

15:28.875 --> 15:30.508
"Now I got her."

15:30.543 --> 15:32.842
Really?

15:32.877 --> 15:35.912
Any information
about this person?

15:35.913 --> 15:37.580
No, surprisingly enough.

15:37.615 --> 15:43.021
It's almost the person that's
here appears to be one thing,

15:43.056 --> 15:46.723
but there's something else.

15:46.724 --> 15:49.176
I don't know what
you're dealing with here,

15:49.211 --> 15:51.629
but I want to go to
the word nonhuman entity.

15:51.664 --> 15:53.329
Okay.

15:53.364 --> 15:56.934
A spirit attachment I think
I had since childhood.

15:56.969 --> 15:58.102
What's her name?

15:58.137 --> 16:01.271
Sharon.

16:01.272 --> 16:03.005
There's something nasty here,

16:03.040 --> 16:07.444
and sadly it's almost like
she's playing into it.

16:07.479 --> 16:08.811
She's letting it happen.

16:08.846 --> 16:10.748
I don't know if that makes
any sense at all.

16:10.783 --> 16:12.634
Not yet.

16:12.669 --> 16:14.311
Watch it.

16:14.346 --> 16:15.918
Watch what?

16:15.953 --> 16:18.523
The way that that statement
will be verified to you.

16:18.558 --> 16:19.655
Okay.

16:19.690 --> 16:21.524
If we took a walk
somewhere else,

16:21.559 --> 16:23.526
do you mind, like, giving us
thoughts and feelings on it?

16:23.527 --> 16:24.760
- No.
- Yeah.

16:24.795 --> 16:25.930
- That's true.
- I would be happy to do that.

16:31.235 --> 16:33.337
The one's got a hand in it.

16:33.372 --> 16:34.789
Really?

16:34.824 --> 16:36.171
Yeah.

16:36.206 --> 16:41.211
And we're talking about a person
who is living in this space?

16:41.246 --> 16:42.680
I think I'm talking about
the person that's living here.

16:42.715 --> 16:44.446
Okay.

16:44.481 --> 16:45.915
You don't know the whole
story from this one.

16:48.404 --> 16:50.787
Yeah.

16:50.822 --> 16:53.290
This one knows more
than they're telling.

16:57.127 --> 16:59.329
- Wow.
- What?

16:59.330 --> 17:01.832
I just got yelled in my head
by a female voice.

17:01.867 --> 17:03.334
Really?

17:15.684 --> 17:17.419
Chip Coffey
is here to try to ID

17:17.420 --> 17:19.320
the source of
the paranormal activity

17:19.356 --> 17:22.156
inside Sharon's home
before October comes,

17:22.157 --> 17:24.492
a month Sharon
says brings tragedy.

17:24.528 --> 17:29.031
We're in Anna's room, where Anna
heard a voice asking for help.

17:29.032 --> 17:32.669
This one knows more
than they're telling.

17:32.704 --> 17:36.639
It's almost,
like, unintentional.

17:36.674 --> 17:38.173
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:38.208 --> 17:41.511
It's weird because we need to
know more information from Anna.

17:41.546 --> 17:43.078
Maybe we just get frank
with her tomorrow,

17:43.113 --> 17:47.016
ask her some hard questions,
and then, if you're up for it,

17:47.051 --> 17:51.154
maybe do a little
investigating with us?

17:51.189 --> 17:55.223
You know I would do anything
for you guys.

17:55.258 --> 17:57.527
We've invited Anna back
to the house today

17:57.562 --> 18:00.881
because we need to see
if Chip is right.

18:00.916 --> 18:04.200
Is she holding something
back from us?

18:04.235 --> 18:05.502
I just wanna clear something up

18:05.537 --> 18:06.803
just because Chip said
something,

18:06.838 --> 18:08.070
there was
something unintentional

18:08.071 --> 18:09.971
that you may be doing, right?

18:10.006 --> 18:12.675
And so have you had
any other experiences

18:12.710 --> 18:14.743
that you didn't
mention before?

18:14.744 --> 18:17.478
Yes.

18:17.513 --> 18:20.348
I have Miranda's
tarot cards here.

18:20.383 --> 18:22.450
Miranda, your sister who died
in the car accident?

18:22.485 --> 18:27.323
Yeah, but when I would try
to communicate through them,

18:27.358 --> 18:31.327
I would, you know,
scare myself.

18:31.362 --> 18:32.628
Even now I'm a little shaky.

18:32.629 --> 18:34.530
I always get shaky when I come
around her cards

18:34.565 --> 18:36.799
or pull them out or anything.

18:36.834 --> 18:39.034
This is all stuff from her?

18:39.035 --> 18:41.202
It is.

18:41.237 --> 18:43.105
And she gave this to you when?

18:43.140 --> 18:45.074
On my 18th birthday,
which was the last time

18:45.109 --> 18:46.107
I saw her.

18:46.142 --> 18:48.877
- Yeah.
- All right.

18:48.912 --> 18:52.315
How do you think
your mom handles all this?

18:52.350 --> 18:54.751
Miranda and my mom
did not get along.

18:54.786 --> 18:55.917
Okay.

18:55.952 --> 18:58.304
How long had they not been
getting along?

18:58.339 --> 19:00.656
Since Miranda was
probably my age.

19:00.657 --> 19:03.693
They had always had a spat,
really,

19:03.728 --> 19:05.662
over anything and everything.

19:05.697 --> 19:07.028
Sure.

19:07.063 --> 19:10.767
So it had been years
that they had not been talking.

19:10.802 --> 19:12.269
This is new information.

19:12.304 --> 19:13.702
We had no idea the relationship

19:13.737 --> 19:16.789
between Miranda and her mom
was so turbulent.

19:16.824 --> 19:19.842
On Facebook, Miranda has
mom listed as Satan.

19:19.877 --> 19:21.042
No.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.777
- So that just shows you kind of how --
- What?

19:22.812 --> 19:25.248
...how much they really
didn't get along.

19:25.283 --> 19:26.750
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:26.785 --> 19:28.182
I get anger.

19:28.217 --> 19:30.387
Like, explosive anger,
and I'm getting so pissed off,

19:30.422 --> 19:33.822
and I don't know --
Why am I getting pissed off?

19:33.823 --> 19:35.790
It's toxic for them to be
around each other,

19:35.825 --> 19:39.228
so when she got into her
accident, her father called me.

19:39.263 --> 19:40.628
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:40.663 --> 19:43.633
Yeah, and I had actually been
woken up with the call.

19:43.668 --> 19:46.603
There's no other way to say
it than to just say it to her

19:46.638 --> 19:47.702
and just --

19:47.737 --> 19:51.606
I remember
the shrieks of agony.

19:51.641 --> 19:55.444
You had to tell her
that Miranda died?

19:55.479 --> 19:56.945
Yes.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.349
That's a completely different
set of terms,

19:59.384 --> 20:03.185
in terms of how
we would investigate.

20:03.186 --> 20:04.919
We've sent Anna
back to her family,

20:04.954 --> 20:07.990
and tonight we need to
figure out if Miranda is here.

20:08.025 --> 20:09.958
We've invited Chip back
to investigate with us

20:09.993 --> 20:12.829
because the entity that is here
seems to connect with him.

20:12.864 --> 20:14.262
Welcome back.
How do you feel?

20:14.263 --> 20:15.496
- Good?
- Yeah, I do.

20:15.531 --> 20:16.964
I think that there's a lot
going on

20:16.999 --> 20:19.101
and you guys will definitely
get to the bottom of it.

20:19.136 --> 20:21.037
All right. Well, let's get
our gear together,

20:21.072 --> 20:23.774
and we'll start investigating.
- All right.

20:23.809 --> 20:26.441
I think we start downstairs
in Anna's room

20:26.476 --> 20:29.279
near some of those artifacts
that Miranda gave to her.

20:29.314 --> 20:32.179
We can use them
as trigger objects.

20:32.214 --> 20:35.517
These are the tarot cards
that Miranda gave Anna,

20:35.552 --> 20:38.820
so I am just gonna attach
the proximity sensor,

20:38.821 --> 20:42.759
and so if anyone reaches
for it or grabs it,

20:42.794 --> 20:45.327
they will go off and alert us.

20:45.362 --> 20:50.700
So Miranda, if you're in here
and you know what those are,

20:50.735 --> 20:54.771
you can reach in
and just grab those, okay?

20:56.639 --> 20:59.173
I'm sorry.

20:59.208 --> 21:00.710
There was nobody close enough.

21:00.745 --> 21:03.077
- No.
- Where's the...

21:03.112 --> 21:04.545
The recorder's on top
of the...

21:04.580 --> 21:06.249
Right there, right there,
right there, right there.

21:06.284 --> 21:10.070
Touch those cards there.

21:10.105 --> 21:13.549
Is your name Miranda?

21:13.584 --> 21:16.958
Is this your house?

21:16.993 --> 21:20.830
I feel like it's probably
very frustrating for you

21:20.865 --> 21:24.667
to be in this position
where no one can see you

21:24.702 --> 21:27.435
and no one can hear you,

21:27.470 --> 21:30.406
but we can try with
what we've brought here.

21:30.407 --> 21:32.942
We can try to see you
and hear you.

21:32.977 --> 21:35.143
- Wow.
- What?

21:35.178 --> 21:37.680
I just got yelled in my head
by a female voice.

21:37.715 --> 21:40.381
Really?

21:40.416 --> 21:42.018
Let me play this back.

21:51.629 --> 21:53.663
- What is that?
- What was that?

22:00.069 --> 22:01.204
- "I'm right here."
- Right here.

22:01.239 --> 22:02.738
"I'm right here."

22:02.773 --> 22:04.507
"I'm right here."

22:07.744 --> 22:09.745
- Is that -- What was that?
- I...

22:09.780 --> 22:10.778
Wait, wait, wait. Stop it.

22:10.813 --> 22:14.017
Something's upstairs
moving around.

22:27.026 --> 22:29.361
October is only two days away,

22:29.396 --> 22:31.662
a month Sharon
associates with death.

22:31.697 --> 22:33.798
Chip is back investigating
with us in Anna's room

22:33.833 --> 22:37.070
to find out if Miranda is here,
or if it's something else.

22:42.774 --> 22:45.811
- That's very, very distinct.
- That's very messed up.

22:45.846 --> 22:47.380
- That is...
- An angry...

22:47.415 --> 22:49.532
Crystal clear.

22:49.567 --> 22:51.649
One, that's angry.

22:51.650 --> 22:54.485
Two, we need to know why.

22:54.520 --> 22:58.023
If this is Miranda,
where is the anger from?

22:58.024 --> 23:01.928
Yeah, I would feel like
she would try to fix it now.

23:01.963 --> 23:02.928
Let's see what we've got.
We're gonna do --

23:02.963 --> 23:05.014
Yeah, let's keep going.

23:05.049 --> 23:07.031
Was that -- What was that?

23:07.066 --> 23:08.301
- I...
- Wait, wait, wait. Stop it.

23:08.336 --> 23:10.034
I heard it.

23:12.772 --> 23:14.939
- Okay.
- It's kind of up here.

23:14.940 --> 23:17.008
- I thought it was up there,
like, in the corner. - Yeah.

23:17.043 --> 23:20.746
It was just right upstairs,
like something fell.

23:20.781 --> 23:22.580
- Then something's upstairs moving around --
- Yeah.

23:22.615 --> 23:26.652
...so I feel like we should
go up there and investigate.

23:29.321 --> 23:31.757
The footsteps sound like
they came from the spare room,

23:31.792 --> 23:34.093
where Chip picked up
on something nasty.

23:34.128 --> 23:37.247
We need to check it out.

23:37.282 --> 23:40.366
Do you know Miranda?

23:44.636 --> 23:47.406
Who resides in this room?

23:51.477 --> 23:56.282
Do you know
who this family is?

23:56.317 --> 23:57.983
Okay. Here we go.

24:03.522 --> 24:07.658
- "I do."
- "I do."

24:07.659 --> 24:10.295
That was weird.

24:10.330 --> 24:12.897
- "I do."
"I do."

24:12.932 --> 24:16.168
Do you think Miranda
would come back up here?

24:16.203 --> 24:19.437
I don't know.
Miranda hated this room.

24:19.472 --> 24:23.108
Maybe what we talked
to downstairs wasn't Miranda.

24:23.143 --> 24:25.878
If this is something
masquerading as Miranda,

24:25.913 --> 24:27.544
who is it?
- Yeah.

24:27.579 --> 24:29.815
You've got a lot going on here.

24:33.185 --> 24:35.119
Last night, we got a lead.

24:36.857 --> 24:38.489
I'm sorry.

24:38.524 --> 24:40.492
Something touched
Miranda's tarot cards,

24:40.527 --> 24:42.493
so we've brought
in Dana Newkirk,

24:42.528 --> 24:46.298
a tarot expert with 15 years
of paranormal experience.

24:46.333 --> 24:48.067
She's going to do a reading
with Anna

24:48.102 --> 24:50.067
using Miranda's tarot cards.

24:50.102 --> 24:52.371
We are hoping this reading
will help us figure out

24:52.406 --> 24:53.939
who is here, and why.

25:05.251 --> 25:07.219
When we investigate,
my tools of choice

25:07.254 --> 25:08.886
are always
the metaphysical ones.

25:08.921 --> 25:12.124
I'll pull cards and just say,
"What is going on here?"

25:15.594 --> 25:16.760
My question --

25:16.795 --> 25:18.963
nonliving,
can you use these cards

25:18.998 --> 25:22.802
to help us have more insight
as to what's actually going on?

25:22.837 --> 25:25.855
And...

25:28.874 --> 25:34.680
Temperance, so temperance
is the card of keeping balance.

25:34.715 --> 25:37.883
Something has become
unbalanced in this house.

25:40.819 --> 25:43.505
And that's mirrored
by the ace of cups.

25:43.540 --> 25:46.157
Cups...
Emotions have become unbalanced.

25:46.192 --> 25:49.478
So is that necessarily
pertaining to just this,

25:49.513 --> 25:52.957
or could that just be,
like, in life in general?

25:52.992 --> 25:56.402
The ace is saying
specifically in this house,

25:56.437 --> 25:59.322
all emotions
are under a state of flux

25:59.357 --> 26:02.208
because there's
this imbalance happening.

26:05.678 --> 26:07.079
Anna, does that sound
like something

26:07.114 --> 26:09.915
that's happening here?

26:09.950 --> 26:12.483
Yes.

26:12.484 --> 26:15.721
My mom, we're not
necessary head at head

26:15.756 --> 26:17.388
like she was with Miranda,

26:17.389 --> 26:20.225
but it seems like
a lot of success

26:20.260 --> 26:22.259
that I try to do seems...

26:22.294 --> 26:27.198
...sometimes blocked for
one reason or another. -

26:27.233 --> 26:30.469
There's some anger issues
in this house

26:30.504 --> 26:32.404
not being managed well.

26:37.843 --> 26:39.010
Interesting.

26:39.045 --> 26:42.731
If I were to just read
this straight up,

26:42.766 --> 26:46.418
what's happening is
that emotional unbalance

26:46.453 --> 26:49.388
is causing the activity
in the house.

26:49.423 --> 26:51.624
Interesting.

26:51.659 --> 26:53.826
- Well...
- I mean...

26:53.861 --> 26:55.358
Chills here.

26:55.393 --> 26:57.094
I think with your mom,

26:57.129 --> 26:59.398
that she might have
some sort of attachment.

26:59.433 --> 27:01.398
- Which feeds into her fears.
- Yeah.

27:01.433 --> 27:05.369
Miranda used to say even
she thought that my mom had,

27:05.370 --> 27:07.273
like you said,
something attached to her.

27:07.308 --> 27:09.575
It's that that's now
manifesting.

27:09.610 --> 27:13.110
It's manifesting activity.

27:13.145 --> 27:15.047
Okay, well, someone is
sending us this message,

27:15.082 --> 27:17.467
so why don't we do
a little EVP work?

27:17.502 --> 27:19.852
The energy in this room
is heightened

27:19.887 --> 27:21.618
after Dana's tarot reading.

27:21.653 --> 27:23.522
It's the perfect time
to communicate and confront

27:23.557 --> 27:24.889
whatever's here.

27:24.924 --> 27:26.390
We need to get answers.

27:26.425 --> 27:29.293
- Are you okay with us playing
this back in front of you? - Yes.

27:29.328 --> 27:32.262
Okay, because it can be
a little disconcerting

27:32.297 --> 27:34.634
the way they come through
on this recorder sometimes.

27:34.669 --> 27:36.368
Okay, all right.

27:42.307 --> 27:47.880
All right, so we've just
completed a tarot card reading,

27:47.915 --> 27:53.052
and we feel like maybe
there's someone

27:53.087 --> 27:55.255
or some people here who are,

27:55.290 --> 27:57.423
as Dana said, nonliving.

28:00.058 --> 28:02.427
Can you tell us your name?

28:07.366 --> 28:10.202
Do you think that we can
fix this house?

28:13.605 --> 28:16.875
Ready?

28:19.111 --> 28:24.250
<i> All right, so we've just
completed a tarot card reading.</i>

28:27.386 --> 28:29.321
Did you hear that?

28:33.025 --> 28:34.658
My god.

28:34.693 --> 28:39.298
<i> What was going on was called
the Satanic panic.</i>

28:39.333 --> 28:41.432
So do we have anything
to worry about?

28:41.467 --> 28:43.703
<i> I mean, you guys can get
wrapped up in that, too.</i>

28:56.560 --> 28:58.627
October is breathing
down our necks,

28:58.662 --> 29:01.966
and we only have one day left
to figure out who is here.

29:02.001 --> 29:03.934
We are in Anna's room,
where we just finished

29:03.969 --> 29:05.936
a tarot card
reading with Dana Newkirk,

29:05.937 --> 29:07.605
and now we're doing
an EVP session.

29:11.175 --> 29:12.841
What do you hear?

29:12.876 --> 29:15.195
Randa, which is her nickname.

29:15.230 --> 29:17.550
- That's what we called her,
was Randa. - Yeah.

29:21.051 --> 29:22.220
I hear it.

29:26.323 --> 29:28.426
"Yes, I do."

29:28.461 --> 29:30.993
"Yes, I do."

29:31.028 --> 29:33.247
Interesting. Well...

29:33.282 --> 29:35.466
- Miranda is here, clearly.
- Yeah.

29:35.501 --> 29:36.932
She said her name --

29:36.967 --> 29:40.705
...and if she thinks we can
fix it then we can fix it.

29:40.740 --> 29:42.905
We just need to figure out how.

29:42.940 --> 29:45.407
We've just confirmed
Miranda is here,

29:45.442 --> 29:48.878
but that doesn't explain
all the activity.

29:48.879 --> 29:51.849
It's safe to say that what
was happening with the reading

29:51.884 --> 29:54.417
really falls in line
with what Chip was getting.

29:54.418 --> 29:59.321
Yeah.
I think Miranda or Randa,

29:59.356 --> 30:01.942
she seems angry
and upset and anxious,

30:01.977 --> 30:04.494
but I think she's trying
to help Anna... - Yep.

30:04.529 --> 30:06.696
...and she's trying
to help Sharon.

30:06.697 --> 30:08.398
Like, "Don't have
the same relationship...

30:08.433 --> 30:10.165
...with Mom that I did."

30:10.200 --> 30:12.234
I think
she's cognizant of that,

30:12.269 --> 30:14.772
and she doesn't want them
to make the same mistakes.

30:14.807 --> 30:16.438
- And it's, like, all starting again.
- Yeah.

30:16.473 --> 30:18.474
And those cards
were very clear.

30:18.509 --> 30:20.310
I mean, it told us
that Sharon's attitude...

30:20.311 --> 30:23.145
...and Sharon's things are
affecting the entire family. - Right.

30:23.180 --> 30:26.648
I mean, I know we feel like
it's family based,

30:26.683 --> 30:31.254
but they're so positive there's
something evil and dark here.

30:31.255 --> 30:34.792
I just want to make sure that
this place is safe for them,

30:34.827 --> 30:37.595
so I think we should call
John Tenney...

30:37.630 --> 30:40.329
...and ask him about Satan worship...
- Right, the Satanic stuff.

30:40.364 --> 30:42.532
...because she's assuming
it's Satanic,

30:42.567 --> 30:45.102
but he actually knows
a lot about that.

30:45.137 --> 30:47.637
And maybe we bring in Sharon.

30:47.638 --> 30:49.072
Yeah, I definitely
think bringing in Sharon

30:49.107 --> 30:50.374
would be a good idea.

30:52.610 --> 30:54.545
We have kind of
an interesting predicament

30:54.580 --> 30:56.012
at this case
we're at right now.

30:56.047 --> 30:59.816
She's got what she considers
to be a haunting,

30:59.851 --> 31:03.754
and this started when she broke
into an abandoned building

31:03.789 --> 31:05.754
and found Satan worship
going on.

31:05.789 --> 31:08.858
It was around 1980,
'79 when this happened.

31:08.859 --> 31:10.526
She sort of blames a lot
of the things

31:10.561 --> 31:14.097
that have happened in her life
on this one moment.

31:14.132 --> 31:16.532
And so before
we investigate with her,

31:16.533 --> 31:18.400
we wanted to get your advice.

31:18.435 --> 31:21.136
<i> The time period you're
talking about the 1980s,</i>

31:21.171 --> 31:24.408
<i> There was -- What was going on
was called the Satanic panic.</i>

31:24.443 --> 31:25.707
Right.

31:25.742 --> 31:28.210
- <i> You know, Satanists are atheists.</i>
- Okay.

31:28.245 --> 31:30.747
<i> Like, they don't even believe
in a God or Satan.</i>

31:30.782 --> 31:33.250
<i> Because she was young
and had this experience,</i>

31:33.285 --> 31:36.151
<i> that fear over time can create issues -- </i>
- Right.

31:36.186 --> 31:38.655
<i>...whether the original
experience was founded</i>

31:38.690 --> 31:40.189
<i> in Satanism or not.</i>

31:40.224 --> 31:42.225
The things that
have happened to her

31:42.226 --> 31:44.327
seem to happen
in the month of October.

31:44.362 --> 31:47.832
We're almost there, so do we
have anything to worry about?

31:47.867 --> 31:48.998
<i> You should be super careful</i>

31:49.033 --> 31:51.333
<i> because if it is
a manifesting quality,</i>

31:51.368 --> 31:55.304
<i> and if it's repeating that's
building power in her mind,</i>

31:55.305 --> 31:57.473
<i> and she thinks
it's coming to a head.</i>

31:57.508 --> 32:01.912
<i> I mean, you guys can get
wrapped up in that, too.</i>

32:01.947 --> 32:03.714
So you're saying
we're in danger?

32:03.749 --> 32:05.849
<i> Yeah.</i>

32:05.850 --> 32:08.234
- How do we protect ourselves?
- Yeah.

32:08.269 --> 32:10.619
<i> Keep in mind
that we're born here.</i>

32:10.620 --> 32:12.989
<i> We live here.
This reality is made for us,</i>

32:13.024 --> 32:15.359
<i> which instantaneously
makes us stronger.</i>

32:15.394 --> 32:18.429
All right.
I guess the power of intention.

32:18.464 --> 32:19.664
- All right.
- Thanks, John.

32:19.699 --> 32:20.864
- Bye, John.<i>
- Bye.</i>

32:20.899 --> 32:22.197
Bye.

32:22.232 --> 32:23.466
Not expecting that.

32:23.501 --> 32:24.935
Did not expect that,
for him to be like,

32:24.970 --> 32:26.370
"Well, you know,
she's creating it,"

32:26.405 --> 32:27.469
which is true.

32:27.504 --> 32:29.705
She's playing into it.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.673
She's letting it happen.
Watch it.

32:31.708 --> 32:33.726
That statement will be
verified to you.

32:33.761 --> 32:35.745
Bringing us into it
is a possibility,

32:35.780 --> 32:36.912
which I never thought of.

32:36.947 --> 32:38.214
Yeah.
Well, with that in mind,

32:38.249 --> 32:39.982
let's just be super careful
and cautious,

32:40.017 --> 32:43.552
and let's go to the darkest
spot here first... - Okay.

32:43.587 --> 32:45.387
...that room.

32:45.388 --> 32:47.091
We'll get Sharon in here,
and she can,

32:47.126 --> 32:50.359
you know, go to battle with us.
- Yeah.

32:50.394 --> 32:53.130
John just confirmed what
our evidence was pointing to --

32:53.165 --> 32:54.863
Sharon manifested
her attachment,

32:54.898 --> 32:56.765
and because she gave it
so much power,

32:56.800 --> 33:00.436
Sharon is the only one
that can get rid of it.

33:00.471 --> 33:04.073
Now, we know you were concerned
with an attachment

33:04.074 --> 33:07.008
or something dark in the house.
- Yes.

33:07.043 --> 33:09.713
I know you thought that
that New Jersey moment

33:09.748 --> 33:11.280
was kind of a catalyst,

33:11.315 --> 33:13.117
but that's not enough
to have given you

33:13.152 --> 33:14.919
some sort of attachment
from that place --

33:14.954 --> 33:16.218
- Right.
- ...but what did happen

33:16.253 --> 33:19.723
is bad things started
to happen to you in your life,

33:19.758 --> 33:23.193
and you looked at that
as kind of the turning point,

33:23.228 --> 33:26.696
so you gave it its form

33:26.697 --> 33:30.799
by blaming everything
not only on it,

33:30.834 --> 33:34.805
but yourself, and it
basically becomes attachment.

33:34.840 --> 33:36.005
I see.

33:36.040 --> 33:38.474
Chip said that he was
getting the feeling

33:38.475 --> 33:41.395
that it finally had
a space of its own.

33:41.430 --> 33:44.315
You were giving it
the space to manifest

33:44.350 --> 33:45.900
because you said
it was there,

33:45.935 --> 33:47.416
and this thing was
in that space,

33:47.451 --> 33:50.320
and so you gave it a home
when you moved into this house.

33:50.321 --> 33:52.256
And that means
it is a bad space.

33:52.291 --> 33:54.156
There is negativity
in that room

33:54.191 --> 33:57.060
because, like he said,
you gave it a home.

33:57.061 --> 33:58.794
You pushed it
in that spare bedroom.

33:58.829 --> 34:03.200
That became where it went,
and a big part of fixing it,

34:03.235 --> 34:08.072
really the only way
to fix it...

34:08.107 --> 34:10.107
is you.

34:10.141 --> 34:12.108
Me?

34:12.109 --> 34:15.277
- Yes, and that's why we brought
you here tonight. - Okay.

34:15.312 --> 34:18.649
You are a force, and tonight
you are going to realize that,

34:18.684 --> 34:21.117
and as much negativity
as you can put out there,

34:21.152 --> 34:23.885
you can put just
as much positivity. - I see.

34:23.920 --> 34:27.357
You can fix it just thinking
the opposite direction,

34:27.391 --> 34:30.527
so that's what we're gonna
tackle first tonight

34:30.527 --> 34:31.927
is we're gonna get in there

34:31.962 --> 34:34.161
and we're gonna
get it out of there.

34:34.197 --> 34:36.900
- All right. We're behind you.
- All right.

34:46.243 --> 34:48.078
When you walked into this door
just now,

34:48.112 --> 34:49.547
I see you've changed.

34:49.581 --> 34:50.946
- Yes, yes.
- Why is that?

34:50.981 --> 34:54.784
- I'm just nervous about being
in here, that's all. -

34:54.819 --> 34:57.952
When you first bought the house,

34:57.987 --> 35:01.424
what did you think when
you walked into this house?

35:01.459 --> 35:02.524
It was...

35:02.559 --> 35:05.462
It had some clean energy
to it that felt good.

35:05.497 --> 35:07.528
- It felt like a home --
- Yeah.

35:07.563 --> 35:10.299
...someplace that I wanted
to raise my kids.

35:10.300 --> 35:12.469
And you need to think
about that.

35:12.504 --> 35:14.436
We see a beautiful space.

35:14.471 --> 35:17.440
- Yeah.
- You need to get rid of it.

35:17.441 --> 35:18.941
I see.

35:18.976 --> 35:20.743
Every time you start thinking

35:20.778 --> 35:22.878
anything negative
about this room,

35:22.913 --> 35:25.415
I want you to instantly
transport yourself

35:25.450 --> 35:27.148
to that vision.

35:27.183 --> 35:29.719
So every time you start thinking
about that creepy,

35:29.720 --> 35:32.688
dark feeling in here, you go,
"No." - No.

35:32.723 --> 35:35.341
- No.
- Not today.

35:35.376 --> 35:37.960
Yeah. Do you hear that?

35:37.961 --> 35:40.329
Do you hear what she's saying?

35:40.364 --> 35:42.332
There's a reason why you're not
part of the circle

35:42.367 --> 35:44.299
because you are not
allowed here.

35:44.300 --> 35:47.871
You don't belong here
in this space or in this home.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.341
There's a reason
why she came in here,

35:51.376 --> 35:52.608
and the moment
she came in here

35:52.643 --> 35:54.812
she felt a little anxious,
because of you.

35:54.847 --> 35:57.045
It is your fault,

35:57.080 --> 36:00.683
and you don't get to do
that anymore.

36:00.684 --> 36:02.551
This is her space.

36:02.586 --> 36:03.819
Now talk to it. Tell him.

36:03.854 --> 36:07.357
This is my space.
This is my family.

36:07.392 --> 36:10.861
This is my room, my home,
my life.

36:10.896 --> 36:12.594
You have no room here anymore.

36:12.629 --> 36:16.700
You need to leave and stop
bothering me

36:16.735 --> 36:18.602
and my children and go.

36:18.637 --> 36:20.469
You're not welcome.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.606
I need you to leave.

36:22.641 --> 36:23.972
Go.

36:24.007 --> 36:25.073
- Play this back.
- Yeah.

36:25.108 --> 36:27.509
<i> Now talk to it. Tell him.</i>

36:27.544 --> 36:30.279
<i> This is my space.
This is my family.</i>

36:30.280 --> 36:32.516
<i> This is my room, my home,
my life.</i>

36:32.551 --> 36:34.717
<i> You have no room here anymore.</i>

36:34.752 --> 36:38.389
<i> You need to leave and stop
bothering me and my children</i>

36:38.424 --> 36:39.888
<i> and go.</i>

36:39.923 --> 36:41.057
<i> You're not welcome.</i>

36:41.092 --> 36:42.192
<i> I need you to leave.</i>

36:42.227 --> 36:43.760
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

36:43.795 --> 36:45.996
- Good.
- Nothing.

36:46.031 --> 36:47.764
- Awesome.
- It's gone.

36:47.799 --> 36:49.498
There's nothing in here.

36:49.499 --> 36:51.000
Awesome.

36:51.035 --> 36:54.837
But with that in mind, we do
want to take you downstairs... - Okay.

36:54.872 --> 36:57.640
...for a little bit,
and I think

36:57.641 --> 36:59.074
that what we're gonna
do down there...

36:59.109 --> 37:01.844
...is gonna make October
even easier for you. - All right.

37:01.879 --> 37:04.281
October is now safe
for Sharon and her children

37:04.316 --> 37:07.802
because she expelled
the malicious manifestation,

37:07.837 --> 37:11.288
but there is still one
last thing we need to.

37:11.323 --> 37:12.687
Sharon is holding a KII meter,

37:12.722 --> 37:15.391
which measures electromagnetic
activity in the room.

37:15.426 --> 37:18.061
If the meter spikes up to yellow
or red it could mean

37:18.096 --> 37:21.082
someone is trying
to communicate.

37:21.117 --> 37:24.068
We wanted to
bring you down here

37:24.103 --> 37:26.654
because we believe

37:26.689 --> 37:29.205
that Miranda is here.

37:29.206 --> 37:30.905
I see.

37:30.940 --> 37:34.478
And while Miranda came off

37:34.513 --> 37:37.045
as very angry,

37:37.080 --> 37:40.148
what we think ultimately
Miranda's goal is,

37:40.183 --> 37:43.487
is to make sure you and Anna
don't end up the same way

37:43.522 --> 37:44.922
as you and Miranda did.

37:44.957 --> 37:46.207
Okay.

37:49.993 --> 37:51.562
- What's going on?
- She's here.

37:51.597 --> 37:53.581
Yeah.

37:55.566 --> 37:57.468
My god.
There were footsteps upstairs.

37:57.503 --> 38:00.571
- Yeah.
- Nobody's up there.

38:15.381 --> 38:17.233
Now that we know October
is harmless,

38:17.268 --> 38:19.085
we can focus on mending
the relationships

38:19.120 --> 38:20.485
in this family.

38:20.520 --> 38:22.288
We've brought Sharon down
to Anna's room

38:22.289 --> 38:24.222
to communicate with Miranda.

38:24.257 --> 38:27.324
What we think ultimately
Miranda's goal is

38:27.359 --> 38:30.663
is to make sure you and Anna
don't end up the same way

38:30.698 --> 38:33.064
as you and Miranda did.

38:33.099 --> 38:34.401
- What's going on?
- She's here.

38:34.436 --> 38:35.868
Yeah, yeah.

38:35.869 --> 38:40.139
Okay, so we're gonna try
to reach out to her.

38:40.174 --> 38:44.410
All right, Miranda, we know
you're down here.

38:44.445 --> 38:47.197
We talked to you.

38:47.232 --> 38:49.914
We brought your mom.

38:49.949 --> 38:53.152
Is this what you want us to do
to fix things here?

38:56.189 --> 38:58.024
The KII just lit up
all the way.

38:58.059 --> 39:01.928
I know.

39:05.798 --> 39:09.068
Do you want your mom and Anna

39:09.103 --> 39:12.338
to have a loving relationship?

39:15.508 --> 39:17.677
What do you want to say?

39:17.712 --> 39:19.444
I love her.

39:19.479 --> 39:21.114
I love her a lot.

39:21.149 --> 39:22.947
I miss her.

39:22.982 --> 39:25.367
I'm sorry
for what happened to her,

39:25.402 --> 39:27.753
and I'm fighting for her
every day.

39:27.788 --> 39:31.257
- It just lit up again.
- Yes.

39:31.292 --> 39:33.124
She's my girl.

39:33.159 --> 39:34.625
She's still my girl.

39:34.660 --> 39:36.929
All right,
let's listen to this,

39:36.964 --> 39:39.199
and we'll see
what we got here.

39:49.676 --> 39:50.942
- "Yes."
- "Yes."

39:57.917 --> 39:59.935
- "I do."
- Aw!

39:59.970 --> 40:01.953
- "I do."
- "I do."

40:01.954 --> 40:05.289
And Miranda,

40:05.324 --> 40:07.960
I know you're here
to help facilitate this,

40:07.995 --> 40:11.030
so we do appreciate
you being here

40:11.065 --> 40:13.583
and helping us with this task

40:13.618 --> 40:16.067
because it is very important,

40:16.102 --> 40:18.337
and when you are ready
to go you can go.

40:30.316 --> 40:32.884
My god.

40:32.919 --> 40:33.985
- Upstairs?
- Yeah.

40:34.020 --> 40:37.123
- There were footsteps upstairs.
- Yeah.

40:37.158 --> 40:39.457
Was that...

40:39.492 --> 40:42.662
- Yeah.
- Yes. That's what I hear.

40:42.697 --> 40:45.832
That was like a, boom,
boom, boom.

40:45.867 --> 40:48.969
Maybe she was leaving.

40:49.004 --> 40:51.472
Maybe she was leaving.

40:51.507 --> 40:53.940
Miranda, are you still here?

41:00.847 --> 41:02.011
Nothing.

41:02.649 --> 41:04.148
This is amazing to me,

41:04.183 --> 41:08.788
this lighting up like that
every time we talked about her,

41:08.823 --> 41:11.257
and now it's just not.
- No.

41:15.995 --> 41:18.531
I mean, what's important
to know is that, like,

41:18.566 --> 41:20.565
she does want
you guys to heal

41:20.566 --> 41:22.968
and to move on
and to do something else.

41:23.003 --> 41:24.736
And you know what else
that means?

41:24.737 --> 41:27.572
That means she forgives you.

41:27.607 --> 41:30.276
For her to come back here
to make sure you and Anna

41:30.311 --> 41:32.844
don't make that
same mistake is really big.

41:32.845 --> 41:35.415
- That's amazing, yeah.
- It's showing that she cares.

41:35.450 --> 41:37.548
Yeah.

41:37.583 --> 41:40.753
- How do you feel?
- I feel relieved.

41:40.788 --> 41:42.288
- You did good.
- Thank you.

41:44.824 --> 41:47.193
This family had a perfect
paranormal storm.

41:47.228 --> 41:48.359
The tools and courage we gave

41:48.394 --> 41:50.296
Sharon helped her
defeat her attachment,

41:50.331 --> 41:52.163
and we were able
to give Miranda a voice

41:52.198 --> 41:55.167
that will prevent history
from repeating itself.

41:55.168 --> 41:56.767
Welcome back to your house.

41:56.802 --> 41:58.971
Thank you.
It's good to be home.

41:59.006 --> 42:00.204
Yeah?

42:00.239 --> 42:02.024
We feel confident leaving
this family

42:02.059 --> 42:04.169
knowing they are safe
because even though

42:04.204 --> 42:07.493
October will always be
a month to grieve,

42:07.528 --> 42:10.783
it's no longer associated
with fear or anger.

42:10.818 --> 42:13.284
- Well, we did it.
- Yep.

42:13.319 --> 42:14.520
I've got another case for you,
though.
