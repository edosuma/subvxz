<i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...

00:03.368 --> 00:04.960
DAN: <i>You stalked your father's murderer</i>

00:04.985 --> 00:06.132
<i>right before he was killed.</i>

00:06.138 --> 00:07.300
CHLOE: <i>I know this looks bad.</i>

00:07.306 --> 00:09.101
<i>Whoever killed Joe
Fields killed my father.</i>

00:09.107 --> 00:10.503
LUCIFER: <i>What, you think
the warden did it?</i>

00:10.509 --> 00:12.138
CHLOE: <i>This man killed my father.</i>

00:12.144 --> 00:13.112
You tore

00:13.137 --> 00:14.659
apart my family.

00:14.684 --> 00:16.309
I can get you whatever you want.

00:16.315 --> 00:17.877
All I want is for you to know

00:17.883 --> 00:19.722
that John Decker's kid got you.

00:19.747 --> 00:21.547
DAN: <i>His name is Boris Sokolov.
He connects criminals,</i>

00:21.553 --> 00:22.882
<i>but he always keeps his own hands clean.</i>

00:22.888 --> 00:24.831
People call me Human Lie Detector.

00:24.856 --> 00:26.643
So, you point me in the right direction

00:26.668 --> 00:28.721
or I'm gonna make
your life a living hell.

00:28.727 --> 00:31.123
Mom, this is Lucifer. Lucifer, Mom.

00:31.129 --> 00:32.198
Mama Decker.

00:32.223 --> 00:34.427
You shall remain right here

00:34.433 --> 00:37.096
on Earth amongst the
creatures you so despise.

00:37.102 --> 00:39.999
You're going to send me into
the life of Charlotte Richards?

00:40.005 --> 00:42.301
I thought I'd dive into my employment.

00:42.307 --> 00:44.303
I was pretty surprised
when you called me.

00:44.309 --> 00:46.042
MOM: <i>You are fairly attractive.</i>

00:47.145 --> 00:48.708
The only place I've ever felt

00:48.714 --> 00:50.764
wanted or respected...

00:50.789 --> 00:52.611
Is here with humanity?!

00:52.617 --> 00:54.513
This is my home!

00:54.519 --> 00:55.781
Deal with it, Mother!

00:55.787 --> 00:57.516
MOM: <i>You seem attached</i>

00:57.522 --> 01:00.086
<i>to these creatures and
I can't figure out why.</i>

01:00.092 --> 01:03.259
Let me at least buy you
dinner tonight to celebrate.

01:30.471 --> 01:31.666
Excuse me.

01:31.691 --> 01:32.497
- Yeah. (chuckles)
- I'll get it for you.

01:32.521 --> 01:34.053
Thank you.

01:34.059 --> 01:38.290
AMENADIEL: You can't kill her, Mom.

01:38.296 --> 01:39.859
Well, of course I can.

01:39.865 --> 01:41.660
I just press this button.

01:41.666 --> 01:43.429
Mom, please...

01:43.435 --> 01:44.463
give me the detonator.

01:44.469 --> 01:47.166
No. This little bug is the reason

01:47.172 --> 01:48.768
that Lucifer doesn't want to go home.

01:48.774 --> 01:50.625
Squash her, problem solved.

01:50.650 --> 01:53.069
Are you really gonna make
me force it away from you?

01:53.094 --> 01:56.108
Trust me, you don't want to do that.

01:56.114 --> 01:57.943
But I can't let you kill Chloe, Mom.

01:57.949 --> 02:00.312
(grunts)

02:00.318 --> 02:01.447
Since when can you...

02:01.453 --> 02:02.815
I tried to warn you.

02:02.821 --> 02:05.317
Apparently, paltry human flesh can't

02:05.323 --> 02:07.386
contain my divinity.

02:07.392 --> 02:09.324
Oh, here we go.

02:11.163 --> 02:12.525
Bomb's in the car.

02:12.531 --> 02:14.063
So exciting.

02:17.702 --> 02:19.465
(giggles)

02:19.471 --> 02:21.066
Mom, stop!

02:21.072 --> 02:23.502
I am trying to help you.

02:23.508 --> 02:25.471
I know Lucifer better
than he knows himself

02:25.477 --> 02:26.739
and if you kill Chloe,

02:26.745 --> 02:29.074
he won't rest until he
finds out who did it

02:29.080 --> 02:30.709
and when he does, Mom,

02:30.715 --> 02:32.311
he will hate you forever.

02:32.317 --> 02:33.913
Come on.

02:33.919 --> 02:37.216
One little human can't mean
more to him than his family.

02:37.222 --> 02:39.285
He killed Uriel to protect her.

02:39.291 --> 02:41.687
Well...

02:41.693 --> 02:43.656
what's so damn special about this one?

02:43.662 --> 02:45.191
That I don't know.

02:45.197 --> 02:46.659
But, Mom, the bottom line is

02:46.665 --> 02:48.661
if we want Luci to go home with us,

02:48.667 --> 02:51.397
then we need to make sure
that it's his decision

02:51.403 --> 02:52.702
to leave Chloe behind.

02:56.107 --> 02:58.938
Well, that was anticlimactic.

02:58.944 --> 03:00.206
(groans)

03:00.212 --> 03:01.207
(shouts)

03:01.213 --> 03:02.241
So, I need to find

03:02.247 --> 03:03.242
a more subtle way

03:03.248 --> 03:05.878
to end Lucifer's silly crush.

03:05.884 --> 03:07.313
(sighs)

03:07.319 --> 03:08.848
LINDA: <i>Tell me everything.</i>

03:08.854 --> 03:10.049
Well, there's...

03:10.055 --> 03:11.667
nothing to say, really.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.366
You had a date...

03:13.391 --> 03:14.487
with Chloe.

03:14.493 --> 03:17.022
That's a big deal, Lucifer.

03:17.028 --> 03:19.325
I need to hear about it.

03:19.331 --> 03:21.594
You know, as your therapist.

03:21.600 --> 03:25.197
Well, for one, I wouldn't say
it was a big deal and...

03:25.203 --> 03:27.399
it wasn't a date, just dinner...

03:27.405 --> 03:29.368
more like a snack,
actually, between friends.

03:29.374 --> 03:30.436
Oh, how was the food?

03:30.442 --> 03:32.208
I've heard their branzino is amazing.

03:33.111 --> 03:34.240
Well, yeah, it's...

03:34.246 --> 03:35.508
hard to say, really.

03:35.514 --> 03:37.109
Too caught up in the moment to notice?

03:37.115 --> 03:38.882
Caught up, in-in a way, yes.

03:40.485 --> 03:42.047
You chickened out, didn't you?

03:42.053 --> 03:44.083
(laughing): What?

03:44.089 --> 03:45.518
I'm the Devil, Doctor.

03:45.524 --> 03:47.219
I don't chicken out.

03:47.225 --> 03:48.621
I just simply thought that she should

03:48.627 --> 03:50.155
enjoy the food without any...

03:50.180 --> 03:51.790
distractions.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.592
Listen, you know, I get it.

03:53.598 --> 03:55.628
Our last breakthrough spooked you

03:55.634 --> 03:56.829
and now you're running scared.

03:56.835 --> 03:59.632
I don't "run scared"
any more than I "chicken."

03:59.638 --> 04:01.467
(chuckles) Not literally.

04:01.473 --> 04:02.902
But you're avoiding the truth.

04:02.908 --> 04:03.936
Also known as lying.

04:03.942 --> 04:06.138
That I know I don't do... ever.

04:06.144 --> 04:07.139
But yet...

04:07.145 --> 04:09.241
you are lying, Lucifer...

04:09.247 --> 04:10.376
(laughs)

04:10.382 --> 04:11.714
...to yourself.

Really? Why?

04:29.601 --> 04:31.030
Was it for...

04:31.036 --> 04:33.265
leaving me all alone at a
restaurant so the busboy

04:33.271 --> 04:35.120
could give me pitiful glances all night?

04:35.145 --> 04:36.702
I know what your explanation
is and I don't want

04:36.708 --> 04:38.604
to know her name, especially not today.

04:38.610 --> 04:40.439
Actually, Detective, that isn't
what I was going to say, I...

04:40.445 --> 04:42.274
Look, Lucifer, I don't
have time for this.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.809
I was just on my way out.

04:43.815 --> 04:45.411
Besides, this is my fault.

04:45.417 --> 04:48.280
I should've known how selfish
and thoughtless you can be.

04:48.286 --> 04:49.315
Lucifer.

04:49.321 --> 04:50.349
(chuckles)

04:50.355 --> 04:51.750
How thoughtful.

04:51.756 --> 04:52.885
Penelope.

04:52.891 --> 04:54.720
You are the sweetest

04:54.726 --> 04:57.423
to come support us on
such a difficult day.

04:57.429 --> 04:58.524
Oh. I bet you

04:58.530 --> 04:59.525
an arm and a leg, Mom,

04:59.531 --> 05:01.060
that he has no idea what today is.

05:01.066 --> 05:03.162
Well, that's rather unwise
of you to wager your lovely

05:03.168 --> 05:04.630
extremities, Detective.

05:04.636 --> 05:06.031
Particularly as I'm perfectly aware

05:06.037 --> 05:07.132
of what today is, actually.

05:07.138 --> 05:09.101
It's a very difficult day...

05:09.107 --> 05:10.135
because...

05:10.141 --> 05:12.037
- Today.
- Today is...

05:12.043 --> 05:13.706
- The first day.
- The first day...

05:13.712 --> 05:15.441
of the of...

05:15.447 --> 05:17.576
trial of the trial of...

05:17.582 --> 05:19.582
- my dad's killer.
- My dad's killer!

05:20.154 --> 05:21.547
Nietzsche? No, wait.

05:21.553 --> 05:23.115
Your dad's killer. Yes, no, I knew that.

05:23.121 --> 05:25.084
I knew that. That's why
I'm here, to support you.

05:25.090 --> 05:27.152
Not talk about myself
'cause that would be selfish.

05:27.158 --> 05:28.220
- Yeah.
- So...

05:28.226 --> 05:29.254
consider me

05:29.260 --> 05:30.356
an emotional jockstrap

05:30.362 --> 05:32.424
for the Decker family jewels. (chuckles)

05:32.430 --> 05:35.327
(whistling)

05:35.333 --> 05:37.129
Hey.

05:37.135 --> 05:40.246
Hmm, someone's chirpy
for a Monday morning.

05:40.271 --> 05:42.234
Yes, I am.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.235
Why?

05:43.241 --> 05:44.303
What's going on?

05:44.309 --> 05:46.305
What, do I need an excuse to be happy?

05:46.311 --> 05:48.707
Hmm, I mean, you're whistling.

05:48.713 --> 05:50.976
You've been... working out lately.

05:50.982 --> 05:52.077
- Mm.
- (sniffs)

05:52.083 --> 05:54.947
Musk-scented aftershave.

05:54.953 --> 05:56.515
Did you...

05:56.521 --> 05:57.516
get laid?

05:57.522 --> 05:58.450
(laughs)

05:58.456 --> 05:59.551
(scoffs) No.

05:59.557 --> 06:01.320
Oh, no, no.

06:01.326 --> 06:03.255
Don't waste your poker face on me, buddy.

06:03.261 --> 06:05.028
I know that grin.

06:06.398 --> 06:07.393
I'm still in shock.

06:07.399 --> 06:08.293
I knew it.

06:08.299 --> 06:09.809
- She's gorgeous.
- Yeah, well,

06:09.834 --> 06:11.563
- it's not like you're Quasimodo.
- No, no, no, no.

06:11.569 --> 06:13.032
Trust me, she is way out of my league.

06:13.038 --> 06:14.099
I mean, she is

06:14.105 --> 06:15.734
goddess-like.

06:15.740 --> 06:17.202
And she came back for seconds.

06:17.208 --> 06:20.476
Then maybe she's the one who
sent you the mystery package.

06:22.580 --> 06:23.575
A mystery package?

06:23.581 --> 06:25.481
Mm-hmm.

06:27.686 --> 06:30.620
I don't recognize the return address.

06:35.260 --> 06:36.455
Oh, jeez.

06:36.461 --> 06:38.490
God!

06:38.496 --> 06:40.225
(sighs)

06:40.231 --> 06:43.399
Wish I could say it was my first.

06:46.938 --> 06:49.168
That's Boris.

06:49.174 --> 06:51.174
Chloe's gonna lose it.

06:56.214 --> 06:58.644
So poised.

06:58.650 --> 07:01.280
The detective obviously
gets her strength from you.

07:01.286 --> 07:02.715
(scoffs) This?

07:02.721 --> 07:04.183
It's just acting.

07:04.189 --> 07:07.553
Sadly, I've had... practice.

07:07.559 --> 07:11.090
I played this role before, 16 years ago.

07:11.096 --> 07:13.529
Well, maybe it's like butt stuff.

07:14.566 --> 07:16.065
Easier the second time around.

07:18.970 --> 07:21.300
(whispering): The severed
head of Boris Sokolov

07:21.306 --> 07:22.468
just arrived at the precinct.

07:22.474 --> 07:24.169
(whispering): That's horrible!

07:24.175 --> 07:25.237
Who's Boris?

07:25.243 --> 07:26.672
He's the prosecution's key witness.

07:26.678 --> 07:28.107
He's our key witness.

07:28.113 --> 07:30.442
He was the only person
that could connect Perry

07:30.448 --> 07:31.877
to the Russian gang. I mean, without him,

07:31.883 --> 07:33.645
the entire case could fall apart.

07:33.651 --> 07:34.780
Oh, God.

07:34.786 --> 07:37.116
How very convenient for Mr. Perry.

07:37.122 --> 07:38.721
(sighs)

07:43.995 --> 07:46.998
(whispering): This is the worst thing
that could be happening right now.

08:28.921 --> 08:30.817
I had no idea Charlotte Richards

08:30.823 --> 08:32.217
was defending Perry.

08:32.224 --> 08:34.254
Wishing we hadn't saved
her life about now.

08:34.260 --> 08:35.688
Well, not to worry, Detective.

08:35.695 --> 08:37.123
I hear Charlotte is a changed woman

08:37.129 --> 08:38.692
since her disappearance, so...

08:38.698 --> 08:40.961
maybe she's not the shark she once was.

08:40.967 --> 08:42.861
At least not in the courtroom.

08:42.868 --> 08:44.197
All rise.

08:44.203 --> 08:45.791
Court is now in session.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.434
The Honorable Judge Estrada presiding.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.669
Given the sudden death

08:49.694 --> 08:51.454
of the State's number one witness,

08:51.460 --> 08:54.274
I assume the defense is
moving for a dismissal?

08:54.280 --> 08:57.177
A motion for dismissal?

08:57.183 --> 08:58.578
Why would I want that, Your Honor?

08:58.584 --> 09:00.613
(chuckles) Looks like Jaws

09:00.619 --> 09:01.881
has been harpooned.

09:01.887 --> 09:02.949
MOM: My apologies.

09:02.955 --> 09:04.718
I'm a little... out of practice.

09:04.724 --> 09:06.353
Um...

09:06.359 --> 09:08.288
Oh, I see.

09:08.294 --> 09:09.689
You're saying that with Boris dead,

09:09.695 --> 09:12.492
the State doesn't have
enough evidence to proceed?

09:12.498 --> 09:14.361
So, if I don't move for dismissal,

09:14.367 --> 09:17.063
then he'll probably make a
complete fool of himself?

09:17.069 --> 09:18.231
Your Honor, our case was

09:18.237 --> 09:20.266
and still is unshakable.

09:20.272 --> 09:21.634
The State has plenty

09:21.640 --> 09:24.437
of other evidence that'll
prove 16 years ago,

09:24.443 --> 09:25.605
the defendant, Perry Smith,

09:25.611 --> 09:27.374
murdered Officer John Decker

09:27.380 --> 09:29.709
and paid Joe Fields to go
to prison for that crime.

09:29.715 --> 09:31.444
Oh, and when Fields
wanted out of their deal,

09:31.450 --> 09:32.379
Perry also killed him.

09:32.385 --> 09:33.813
Your Honor, with all due respect,

09:33.819 --> 09:34.848
granting a dismissal

09:34.854 --> 09:36.116
would be ludicrous.

09:36.122 --> 09:37.571
Boris Sokolov's death,

09:37.596 --> 09:40.253
while undoubtedly tragic,

09:40.259 --> 09:42.789
changes nothing.

09:42.795 --> 09:45.091
Well, the defense agrees.

09:45.097 --> 09:46.359
What?

09:46.365 --> 09:48.962
His death doesn't change a single thing.

09:48.968 --> 09:51.564
With or without Mr. Sokolov's testimony,

09:51.570 --> 09:53.266
my client should never have been charged

09:53.272 --> 09:54.670
with these crimes.

09:55.474 --> 09:56.436
Well...

09:56.442 --> 09:59.005
seeing as both parties agree,

09:59.011 --> 10:00.640
the trial will proceed immediately.

10:00.646 --> 10:01.641
Actually, Your Honor,

10:01.647 --> 10:03.209
the State would like to, uh,

10:03.215 --> 10:04.277
request a continuance.

10:04.283 --> 10:06.346
In light of the death of our key witness,

10:06.352 --> 10:09.282
our office needs time to, uh, reexamine

10:09.288 --> 10:10.617
its strategy.

10:10.623 --> 10:11.818
But I'm confused, Your Honor.

10:11.824 --> 10:13.553
Didn't we just hear the prosecution say

10:13.559 --> 10:15.822
their case was "unshakable"?

10:15.828 --> 10:17.490
We did.

10:17.496 --> 10:18.625
Request denied.

10:18.631 --> 10:22.232
Session will resume after lunch.

10:27.073 --> 10:28.935
What the hell are you doing, Mother?

10:28.941 --> 10:30.203
Oh, calm down, Lucifer.

10:30.209 --> 10:31.571
This isn't pleasant for me, either.

10:31.577 --> 10:33.773
Oh, yes, I can see
you're suffering terribly.

10:33.779 --> 10:36.042
I was good up there, wasn't I?

10:36.048 --> 10:38.478
Not sure why humans spend
so much time in law school.

10:38.484 --> 10:39.479
Two nights seemed plenty.

10:39.485 --> 10:40.947
Mum.

10:40.953 --> 10:43.716
I had to find a way to open your eyes.

10:43.722 --> 10:45.718
You need to see that this
Chloe you so adore

10:45.724 --> 10:46.686
isn't worthy of you.

10:46.692 --> 10:47.787
(scoffs)

10:47.793 --> 10:49.222
I admit I enjoy working
with her, but adore,

10:49.228 --> 10:50.390
that's a bit much.

10:50.396 --> 10:52.659
Oh, please. You've
sacrificed more for her

10:52.665 --> 10:54.651
than you ever have for anyone else.

10:54.676 --> 10:57.606
Have you forgotten?
You killed your brother,

10:57.612 --> 10:58.908
my son, to protect her.

10:58.914 --> 11:02.445
Do you think there's anything
even remotely similar

11:02.451 --> 11:03.446
that she would do for you?

11:03.452 --> 11:05.514
I suppose...

11:05.520 --> 11:06.916
I don't know.

11:06.922 --> 11:08.984
Well, if all goes according
to plan in that courtroom,

11:08.990 --> 11:10.286
you will know.

11:10.292 --> 11:11.887
Know that she doesn't deserve you,

11:11.893 --> 11:13.289
because she doesn't care about you

11:13.295 --> 11:14.957
like you care about her.

11:14.963 --> 11:17.093
You need to see that you're
not meant to be together.

11:17.099 --> 11:19.061
You belong with your family.

11:19.067 --> 11:20.830
Which is why I have to do this.

11:20.836 --> 11:22.702
Do what, Mum?

11:25.240 --> 11:27.203
What sort of evil plan
are you concocting?

11:27.209 --> 11:29.605
And please don't tell me
it began by killing Boris.

11:29.611 --> 11:31.674
Oh, actually, that was just
a happy twist of fate.

11:31.680 --> 11:32.942
I was gonna blow Chloe up,

11:32.948 --> 11:34.276
but Amenadiel talked me out of it.

11:34.282 --> 11:36.278
You what?!

11:36.284 --> 11:38.892
Mother, I swear,
if you hurt her, I will rip...

11:38.917 --> 11:41.588
Well, looks like your brother was right.

11:43.492 --> 11:46.059
Just promise me that you won't touch her.

11:48.130 --> 11:50.597
I'm not going to hurt anyone.

11:56.304 --> 11:57.933
Lucifer, you promise me,

11:57.939 --> 12:01.036
whatever that was,
that it doesn't affect the trial.

12:01.042 --> 12:03.105
First of all, Detective,
there is no "that."

12:03.111 --> 12:07.977
And secondly, rest assured,
everything will be okay.

12:07.983 --> 12:09.582
I've got this.

12:17.592 --> 12:19.488
You looking for Boris' forensics report?

12:19.494 --> 12:20.489
(sighs)

12:20.495 --> 12:21.490
Uh-huh.

12:21.496 --> 12:22.691
Hasn't come in yet.

12:22.697 --> 12:24.427
Ella should have it any minute now.

12:24.433 --> 12:27.563
I know this isn't my case,
but I'm freaking out, Dan.

12:27.569 --> 12:29.198
I can't let Perry get
away with everything.

12:29.204 --> 12:30.499
You won't.

12:30.505 --> 12:32.501
You didn't see Charlotte
Richards in court today.

12:32.507 --> 12:33.803
(high-pitched): Char...?
(clears his throat)

12:33.809 --> 12:34.804
I'm sorry. Uh,

12:34.810 --> 12:36.972
Charlotte Richards is,
uh, defending Perry?

12:36.978 --> 12:38.073
Yeah.

12:38.079 --> 12:40.009
Really? She's that good?

12:40.015 --> 12:41.911
Yes, she's the best.

12:41.917 --> 12:43.913
Which is why it would be
helpful if we could...

12:43.919 --> 12:45.981
Well, if you could tie
Perry to Boris' murder.

12:45.987 --> 12:48.551
Okay, well, motive and M.O. line up.

12:48.557 --> 12:49.985
Boris' tongue was cut out.

12:49.991 --> 12:53.355
So the killer was sending
a really clear message...

12:53.361 --> 12:55.057
Loose lips get their head clipped.

12:55.063 --> 12:58.060
Perry did this so Boris
couldn't testify, I know it.

12:58.066 --> 13:00.496
But hasn't he been behind
bars since you arrested him?

13:00.502 --> 13:01.831
Yeah, but he could have
orchestrated it in prison.

13:01.837 --> 13:02.865
It's also his M.O.

13:02.871 --> 13:04.900
Exactly, and if Perry is
good at anything,

13:04.906 --> 13:06.602
it's making other people
pay for his crimes.

13:06.608 --> 13:08.571
Okay, well, whoever
Perry hired to do this

13:08.577 --> 13:09.705
was one sharp dude.

13:09.711 --> 13:12.408
The cut on Boris' neck is
extremely precise.

13:12.414 --> 13:15.377
I'm thinking industrial-size
professional slicer.

13:15.383 --> 13:19.181
Listen, I'm gonna do
everything I can to find him.

13:19.187 --> 13:21.217
Even if I have to interview the owner

13:21.223 --> 13:22.718
of every single meat slicer in L.A.

13:22.724 --> 13:24.553
ELLA: You won't have to.

13:24.559 --> 13:27.556
There was also non-human DNA on Boris.

13:27.562 --> 13:29.425
Swine, to be exact.

13:29.431 --> 13:31.961
A unique cross-bred
for its delicious meat.

13:31.967 --> 13:34.501
And there's only one place that sells it.

13:38.006 --> 13:39.301
Ah!

13:39.307 --> 13:40.506
Hi.

13:40.531 --> 13:42.638
That's so sweet of you,
but you don't have to stick around.

13:42.644 --> 13:44.073
- Trials can be so boring.
- Well,

13:44.079 --> 13:45.207
not this one.

13:45.213 --> 13:46.141
What do you mean?

13:46.147 --> 13:47.209
Mr. Morningstar,

13:47.215 --> 13:48.878
we're ready for you.

13:48.884 --> 13:50.980
Wonderful. Lovely. Right.

13:50.986 --> 13:54.487
Off I go to shield you from
that Quid Pro Ho, Detective.

13:55.557 --> 13:56.752
Lucifer, what are you doing?

13:56.758 --> 13:58.988
Well, I figured there's no reason for us

13:58.994 --> 14:02.262
to lose our heads just
because Boris lost his.

14:03.571 --> 14:06.896
I swear to tell the truth,
he whole truth,

14:06.902 --> 14:09.665
and nothing but the truth,

14:09.671 --> 14:11.383
so help me Dad.

14:19.857 --> 14:20.985
Mr. Morningstar,

14:20.991 --> 14:23.921
you were there when Boris was arrested.

14:23.927 --> 14:26.023
Right? Working with Detective Espinoza.

14:26.029 --> 14:27.892
That is correct.

14:27.898 --> 14:29.761
Except I call him Detective Douche.

14:29.767 --> 14:31.095
(laughter)

14:31.101 --> 14:32.634
But that's another story.

14:33.670 --> 14:35.733
So would you please describe to us

14:35.739 --> 14:36.868
what happened?

14:36.874 --> 14:38.136
Yes, I'd love to, actually.

14:38.142 --> 14:39.303
May-may I have the floor?

14:39.309 --> 14:40.271
By all means.

14:40.277 --> 14:42.006
LUCIFER: Thank you.

14:42.012 --> 14:44.041
I'm going to need...

14:44.047 --> 14:46.010
Hello.

14:46.016 --> 14:47.278
May I borrow your scarf?

14:47.284 --> 14:49.647
Your Honor, is this necessary?

14:49.653 --> 14:51.949
Well, you want the full story, don't you?

14:51.955 --> 14:53.918
I mean, the Devil's in the details.

14:53.924 --> 14:55.957
Thank you ever so much.

14:57.060 --> 15:00.024
Right. Myself and Detective Douche...

15:00.030 --> 15:01.459
Sorry, Detective Espinoza...

15:01.465 --> 15:03.194
Were asked by the LAPD

15:03.200 --> 15:04.929
to perform a sting operation.

15:04.935 --> 15:05.930
Not the singer.

15:05.936 --> 15:08.866
- (laughter)
- So we had to go undercover

15:08.872 --> 15:10.201
at Boris' bathhouse.

15:10.207 --> 15:11.369
Guns of steel...

15:11.375 --> 15:13.371
Got up there... (imitated slashing sound)

15:13.377 --> 15:15.006
Walked over like he's constantly got

15:15.012 --> 15:16.340
a gun between his legs...

15:16.346 --> 15:19.377
Boris looked me in the eye, and he said,

15:19.383 --> 15:21.479
(Russian accent):
"People call me human lie detector."

15:21.485 --> 15:22.647
He was going to kill...

15:22.653 --> 15:25.116
Shook my hand like some
kind of Roman warrior...

15:25.122 --> 15:28.219
...and it was sealed,
and I handed over the investigation

15:28.225 --> 15:30.588
to Detective Decker.

15:30.594 --> 15:32.056
- Thank you.
- (laughter, applause)

15:32.062 --> 15:33.391
♪ Stop draggin' me down ♪

15:33.397 --> 15:34.659
♪ ♪

15:34.665 --> 15:38.200
♪ Stop dragging me down, yeah. ♪

15:40.137 --> 15:41.566
DAN: I got a question.

15:41.572 --> 15:43.668
Do you ever get the feeling
like you've been used?

15:43.674 --> 15:46.470
You mean, by... Oh, I don't know...

15:46.476 --> 15:50.341
The woman who's defending the
killer of your ex-wife's dad?

15:50.347 --> 15:51.409
What?

15:51.415 --> 15:53.477
Charlotte Richards is the gorgeous lady

15:53.483 --> 15:54.445
you slept with, right?

15:54.451 --> 15:56.447
How the hell did you know that?

15:56.453 --> 15:59.050
Well, I saw a long, honey-blonde hair

15:59.056 --> 16:00.351
on your coat the other day.

16:00.357 --> 16:02.653
It was curlier than Chloe's. And then,

16:02.659 --> 16:04.455
I spotted a smudge of lipstick

16:04.461 --> 16:05.857
on your cuff... Burgundy shade.

16:05.863 --> 16:09.560
Bold, but not too sexy. Lawyer color.

16:09.566 --> 16:10.628
Really?

16:10.634 --> 16:13.731
No. I just saw your butt pucker

16:13.737 --> 16:16.100
when Chloe mentioned her
name in the lab this morning.

16:16.106 --> 16:17.835
God.

16:17.841 --> 16:19.737
Why are you so worried?

16:19.743 --> 16:21.539
I mean, you didn't tell her
anything about the case

16:21.545 --> 16:23.407
that she could use in court, right?

16:23.413 --> 16:26.477
- I don't think so, but...
- There you go.

16:26.483 --> 16:27.778
Mezcal cocktails, man.

16:27.784 --> 16:29.881
Oof. Those sneak up on you.

16:29.887 --> 16:31.983
She did keep wanting to
talk about our exes,

16:31.989 --> 16:34.185
and all I thought was, you know what,
she's so easy to talk to.

16:34.191 --> 16:35.319
She's so sympathetic.

16:35.325 --> 16:36.687
God, I'm such an idiot.

16:36.693 --> 16:38.789
- Hey...
- No, her taking Perry's case

16:38.795 --> 16:40.291
right after we...

16:40.297 --> 16:41.859
It can't be a coincidence.

16:41.865 --> 16:43.895
Why not?

16:43.901 --> 16:46.230
- Maybe she really just likes you.
- Yeah.

16:46.236 --> 16:47.954
- 44.
- Hi. We'll take

16:47.979 --> 16:50.538
the headless body of a dude
named Boris, please.

16:53.510 --> 16:54.972
I was going to call you guys.

16:54.978 --> 16:56.741
I was just... scared.

16:56.747 --> 16:59.677
A few days ago, this guy approached me.

16:59.683 --> 17:01.012
Big creepy dude.

17:01.018 --> 17:03.047
He demanded the keys to use
the equipment after hours.

17:03.053 --> 17:05.383
No questions asked, unless I wanted

17:05.388 --> 17:06.651
to end up in the sausage myself.

17:06.656 --> 17:08.685
- Do you know his name?
- No.

17:08.692 --> 17:10.755
Asian, big.

17:10.761 --> 17:12.294
Very scary.

17:13.829 --> 17:17.896
But the scar on his neck
it's very distinctive.

17:18.765 --> 17:20.196
Thank you, Mr. Morningstar.

17:20.203 --> 17:22.532
What a, uh, vivid picture.

17:22.539 --> 17:25.336
It's almost as if Boris
himself just testified.

17:25.342 --> 17:27.637
(quietly): Except a more handsome version.

17:27.644 --> 17:29.640
Oh, stop it, Judy.

17:29.646 --> 17:30.641
(chuckles)

17:30.647 --> 17:32.143
(clears throat) Thank you.

17:32.149 --> 17:33.444
Right actually, to that,

17:33.450 --> 17:34.779
I would like to add one
more thing, if I may...

17:34.785 --> 17:37.515
I think we've had enough, Your Honor.

17:37.521 --> 17:39.417
Shh! Please...

17:39.423 --> 17:41.519
continue Luc...

17:41.525 --> 17:43.955
Mr. Morningstar.

17:43.961 --> 17:46.424
Thank you, my darling.

17:46.430 --> 17:49.794
Yes, I'd just like to
say, for the record,

17:49.800 --> 17:53.497
the LAPD, and Detective Decker,
in particular,

17:53.503 --> 17:56.133
acted impeccably on this case.

17:56.139 --> 17:59.370
This whole courtroom,
nay, the entire city

17:59.376 --> 18:01.973
can rest assured that someone as honest,

18:01.979 --> 18:05.476
trustworthy,
and reliable as Detective Decker

18:05.482 --> 18:07.812
is out there protecting them.

18:07.818 --> 18:12.416
She is... truly good.

18:12.422 --> 18:13.751
And I don't mean in bed.

18:13.757 --> 18:15.386
I wouldn't know.

18:15.392 --> 18:16.858
That's how good she is.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.024
Thank you.

18:20.030 --> 18:21.025
Miss Richards?

18:21.031 --> 18:23.665
Your witness.

18:25.435 --> 18:28.670
I have no questions at this time.

18:30.507 --> 18:32.540
(thunder crashes)

18:41.651 --> 18:42.747
Hey!

18:42.753 --> 18:43.781
That's Chloe's car.

18:43.787 --> 18:44.882
What are you looking for?

18:44.888 --> 18:45.987
Hey.

18:47.024 --> 18:48.753
I was, um...

18:48.759 --> 18:49.754
You.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.622
I was looking for you.

18:51.628 --> 18:53.124
Really?

18:53.130 --> 18:54.662
Yeah, I've missed you.

18:56.266 --> 18:59.030
It's true, I still think about you, Maze.

18:59.036 --> 19:02.837
Every day. And every
time that I see you, it's...

19:04.741 --> 19:06.641
I miss you, too.

19:14.818 --> 19:16.147
It's like fireworks, isn't it?

19:16.153 --> 19:18.282
(chuckles)

19:18.288 --> 19:20.317
But are you sure that's the kind

19:20.323 --> 19:21.723
you're looking for?

19:25.295 --> 19:27.780
Or was it this?

19:31.935 --> 19:35.766
One... tell your mother no one
is hurting Chloe on my watch.

19:35.772 --> 19:37.101
And, two...

19:37.107 --> 19:38.740
Don't ever lie to me like that again.

19:56.494 --> 19:58.623
STEDMAN: And what did Boris have to say

19:58.629 --> 20:00.625
when you interrogated him?

20:00.631 --> 20:02.794
He confessed that he
routinely provided fall guys

20:02.800 --> 20:05.597
for the Russian gang that runs the prison

20:05.603 --> 20:07.554
where the defendants worked
since the late '90s.

20:07.579 --> 20:09.468
STEDMAN: And is there anything else

20:09.474 --> 20:12.471
that is remarkable about this prison?

20:12.477 --> 20:14.239
It is the very prison whose corruption

20:14.245 --> 20:15.540
John Decker was investigating

20:15.546 --> 20:17.242
when he was murdered 16 years ago.

20:17.248 --> 20:18.410
Holy cow.

20:18.416 --> 20:21.650
It's all so coincidental, isn't it?

20:22.617 --> 20:25.250
Just like the odd timing of Boris' murder.

20:25.256 --> 20:27.519
I withdraw that, Your Honor.

20:27.525 --> 20:28.754
No further questions.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.926
Thank you, Detective.

20:34.799 --> 20:36.795
I have no questions for this witness.

20:36.801 --> 20:38.534
STEDMAN: The prosecution
rests, Your Honor.

20:39.689 --> 20:41.700
Your turn to shine, Ms. Richards.

20:41.706 --> 20:44.036
As its first witness,

20:44.042 --> 20:46.942
the defense would like to
recall Lucifer Morningstar.

20:52.050 --> 20:54.183
Oh, it's fine.

20:56.154 --> 20:58.116
Just one small question, Mr. Morningstar.

20:58.122 --> 21:00.018
And please remember that you're still

21:00.024 --> 21:01.620
under oath.

21:01.626 --> 21:03.488
Who was first on the Fields crime scene?

21:03.494 --> 21:06.958
First on the scene was
the detective, I believe.

21:06.964 --> 21:08.983
I'm sorry, which detective?

21:09.008 --> 21:10.310
Detective Decker.

21:10.335 --> 21:12.241
MOM: Are you sure? How do you know?

21:12.266 --> 21:13.799
LUCIFER: Quite sure. Yeah, she told me.

21:13.805 --> 21:15.167
It's kind of strange, isn't it,

21:15.173 --> 21:16.968
for the man accused
of killing John Decker

21:16.974 --> 21:19.337
to be found dead by
Decker's own daughter,

21:19.343 --> 21:20.272
Chloe Decker?

21:20.278 --> 21:21.873
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance?

21:21.879 --> 21:22.941
I'm getting to that.

21:22.947 --> 21:24.810
Would you please read who,

21:24.816 --> 21:27.145
according to the official police report,

21:27.151 --> 21:28.984
was the first officer on the scene?

21:31.422 --> 21:32.517
(whispering): What's wrong?

21:32.523 --> 21:33.752
I'll tell you later.

21:33.758 --> 21:36.254
Well, it says Detective Espinoza.

21:36.260 --> 21:39.357
I thought you said Chloe Decker
was an impeccable detective.

21:39.363 --> 21:40.425
Objection, Your Honor!

21:40.431 --> 21:41.760
No, I-I'd like to answer that.

21:41.766 --> 21:43.728
She is. That's why she

21:43.734 --> 21:45.764
took herself off the
investigation immediately.

21:45.770 --> 21:48.567
But not until after she'd
found her dad's killer dead?

21:48.573 --> 21:50.001
- (groans)
- STEDMAN: Objection!

21:50.007 --> 21:51.970
What's he objecting to... Air quotes?

21:51.976 --> 21:54.773
I'm simply stating that if
what we just heard is true,

21:54.779 --> 21:57.109
then there's a very
plausible alternative story

21:57.115 --> 21:59.177
to the one that the State is presenting.

21:59.183 --> 22:01.780
Chloe Decker had motive, opportunity,

22:01.786 --> 22:04.449
and the LAPD to protect
her and help her frame

22:04.455 --> 22:06.918
an innocent man for
her personal vendetta.

22:06.924 --> 22:08.153
With all due respect, Your Honor,

22:08.159 --> 22:10.222
Chloe Decker is not on trial here.

22:10.228 --> 22:12.224
MOM: And my client shouldn't be, either.

22:12.230 --> 22:13.859
Because it appears he is the victim

22:13.865 --> 22:15.731
of the LAPD's incompetence.

22:17.702 --> 22:20.198
Unless, of course, the report is right,

22:20.204 --> 22:23.806
and it is you that is lying,
Mr. Morningstar?

22:25.443 --> 22:27.572
What you're implying is preposterous.

22:27.578 --> 22:29.812
The Detective would never hurt anyone.

22:33.951 --> 22:35.313
But yes.

22:35.319 --> 22:37.182
What I said is the truth.

22:37.188 --> 22:39.484
Under oath or otherwise.

22:39.490 --> 22:40.956
I don't lie.

22:46.464 --> 22:47.939
LUCIFER: <i>Detective?</i>

22:47.947 --> 22:48.922
Please.

22:48.947 --> 22:50.644
Trust me, you do not
want to talk to me right now.

22:50.668 --> 22:52.330
You're right, I don't. You look scary.

22:52.336 --> 22:55.233
But look, I apologize for
my controversial testimony,

22:55.239 --> 22:56.635
but I was clearly bamboozled.

22:56.641 --> 23:00.572
You didn't expect me to lie
on the stand, did you?

23:00.578 --> 23:02.407
It's not about your answers.

23:02.413 --> 23:04.276
It's about Charlotte's questions.

23:04.282 --> 23:06.411
She wouldn't have even asked
them unless she already knew

23:06.417 --> 23:08.947
I was first on scene.

23:08.953 --> 23:10.415
Let's see. Who could've told her?

23:10.421 --> 23:11.616
Detective, I didn't.

23:11.622 --> 23:13.351
You say that, but you also said

23:13.357 --> 23:16.588
your relationship with Charlotte
wouldn't affect this trial.

23:16.594 --> 23:18.727
It just did.

23:21.265 --> 23:23.161
Detective!

23:23.167 --> 23:25.401
♪ ♪

23:30.875 --> 23:31.903
Charlotte?

23:31.909 --> 23:34.273
How could you do this to me?

23:34.298 --> 23:36.107
What exactly?

23:36.113 --> 23:37.709
I've done several things to you.

23:37.715 --> 23:39.644
Did you sleep with me to
get intel on this case?

23:39.650 --> 23:42.714
Of course, but it's not like you
didn't get anything out of it.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.950
"Mind altering," I believe you called it.

23:44.956 --> 23:47.252
Yeah, literally, apparently.

23:47.258 --> 23:50.722
Because I don't remember telling
you anything about this case.

23:50.728 --> 23:53.491
- Did you roofie me or something?
- I didn't need to.

23:53.497 --> 23:56.595
I've learned sex puts your
gender into a mild coma.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.997
Offered the perfect window
to go through your phone.

23:59.003 --> 24:00.165
So, maybe...

24:00.171 --> 24:02.734
next time, you should put your phone away

24:02.740 --> 24:04.069
before we have the sex.

24:04.075 --> 24:05.003
"Next time"?

24:05.009 --> 24:06.004
Mm-hmm.

24:06.010 --> 24:07.343
Are you insane?

24:09.480 --> 24:11.046
(whispers): You tell me.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.186
(sighs)

24:19.023 --> 24:21.019
LINDA: I wish I could say
that I'm surprised

24:21.025 --> 24:22.554
Maze blew up your car.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.356
She is...

24:24.362 --> 24:25.690
Maze.

24:25.696 --> 24:26.858
I know, right?

24:26.864 --> 24:28.593
Slightest provocation,

24:28.599 --> 24:30.312
- and she turns into a little...
- Hellion?

24:30.337 --> 24:32.397
Exactly.

24:32.403 --> 24:33.798
Let me ask you though...

24:33.804 --> 24:36.935
Why do you think that she reacted so...

24:36.941 --> 24:38.470
passionately?

24:38.476 --> 24:41.072
Because she's a complete maniac
fueled by rage and violence.

24:41.078 --> 24:44.943
Now, as your friend,
not your... therapist,

24:44.949 --> 24:48.780
you feel you did nothing
at all to anger her?

24:48.786 --> 24:50.649
Well, s...

24:50.655 --> 24:52.884
Maybe not nothing.

24:52.890 --> 24:55.754
I may have obscured the truth a bit.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.355
- Otherwise known as lying.
- Linda,

24:57.361 --> 24:59.958
I had no choice.
You have to understand that.

24:59.964 --> 25:01.726
Oh, I do. Oh, I do.
You were... you were dealing

25:01.732 --> 25:03.595
with matters of great importance.

25:03.601 --> 25:06.131
So important, you feel justified

25:06.137 --> 25:07.932
to act any way you see fit.

25:07.938 --> 25:11.269
Even if that means hurting
people you care about.

25:11.275 --> 25:13.809
You "did what you had to do."

25:14.712 --> 25:16.641
(exhales)

25:16.647 --> 25:18.343
That's, uh...

25:18.349 --> 25:20.516
that's what I did to you.

25:21.852 --> 25:24.416
I treated Maze the same
way that I treated you.

25:24.422 --> 25:26.685
Yeah, except I'm just your friend.

25:26.691 --> 25:29.120
And Maze is...

25:29.126 --> 25:31.456
well, more.

25:31.462 --> 25:33.024
So, it's way worse.

25:33.030 --> 25:35.660
And as my friend,

25:35.666 --> 25:37.529
your advice is?

25:37.535 --> 25:39.130
Apologize your ass off.

25:39.136 --> 25:41.099
Or next time, she might blow that up.

25:41.105 --> 25:42.967
(sighs)

25:42.973 --> 25:45.303
MAZE: <i>Maybe you don't understand.</i>

25:45.309 --> 25:48.206
Mommy Dearest tried to kill Chloe.

25:48.212 --> 25:50.175
Oh, I understand. She told me.

25:50.181 --> 25:52.744
- She did?
- Yes. We're past that.

25:52.750 --> 25:54.237
What I don't understand, though,

25:54.262 --> 25:56.014
is how the detective
can think I'm the one

25:56.020 --> 25:59.050
who leaked sensitive
information to my mum.

25:59.056 --> 26:00.385
How could she?

26:00.391 --> 26:02.387
Yeah, Chloe's the bad guy.

26:02.393 --> 26:03.955
Mm.

26:03.961 --> 26:06.641
If only I knew who really gave
Mom that information.

26:09.633 --> 26:11.930
Right. If only.

26:11.936 --> 26:14.332
Oh! Good. You came.

26:14.338 --> 26:16.401
Yes, he did.

26:16.407 --> 26:17.936
Thanks for coming, Dan.

26:17.942 --> 26:19.437
Anything up lately?

26:19.443 --> 26:20.772
I don't know. You tell me.

26:20.778 --> 26:22.607
Lucifer called me here.

26:22.613 --> 26:24.743
Yes. Well, I was thinking,
as my testimony didn't go

26:24.749 --> 26:27.645
quite as planned, that it
might help fix things to prove

26:27.651 --> 26:29.647
that Perry was behind Boris' killing.

26:29.653 --> 26:31.449
- Already working on it, man.
- Fantastic!

26:31.455 --> 26:33.151
Well then, please tell me
you have some scintillating

26:33.157 --> 26:35.720
cop-speak on how to
accomplish that tiny task.

26:35.726 --> 26:39.324
Well, uh, the guy who chopped
Boris's head off had this scar.

26:39.330 --> 26:40.458
It's actually a brand.

26:40.464 --> 26:42.427
Signature of the Alhambra Triads,

26:42.433 --> 26:44.362
they're a Chinese crime syndicate.

26:44.368 --> 26:45.897
Lots of them were in the
prison that Perry ran.

26:45.903 --> 26:48.032
Triads hate the Russians, so

26:48.038 --> 26:49.701
makes sense to pit them
against each other.

26:49.707 --> 26:52.137
Yeah. You should
definitely probe this angle.

26:52.143 --> 26:54.339
Mm. (sniffles)

26:54.345 --> 26:57.108
Rumors are they use a Chinese
cultural center as a front.

26:57.114 --> 26:59.544
Right. Well, let's start
there then, shall we?

26:59.550 --> 27:01.446
DAN: <i>These guys</i>

27:01.452 --> 27:02.747
are notoriously violent,
so let's try to get

27:02.753 --> 27:04.149
in and out as quickly
as possible, all right?

27:04.155 --> 27:05.717
Oh, speaking of "in and out,"

27:05.723 --> 27:08.920
this case really seems to be
touching you, Dan.

27:08.926 --> 27:10.822
You know, in a very personal way.

27:10.828 --> 27:12.924
All right. Shh. Yeah.
It's personal, obviously.

27:12.930 --> 27:14.392
Just try to keep it down, all right?

27:14.398 --> 27:16.094
Well, it's almost like you want to take

27:16.100 --> 27:18.096
Charlotte Richards down yourself.

27:18.102 --> 27:21.299
Like, way down, and give her a hard time.

27:21.305 --> 27:22.534
What are you trying to say, Maze?

27:22.540 --> 27:24.202
Yes, what are you driving at, Maze?

27:24.208 --> 27:25.303
"Driving at."

27:25.309 --> 27:26.504
Good one.

27:26.510 --> 27:27.906
N-No. I'm just...

27:27.912 --> 27:32.310
really impressed with how
much Dan wants to penetrate

27:32.316 --> 27:34.145
this thing from every

27:34.151 --> 27:35.613
position.

27:35.619 --> 27:37.282
You know?

27:37.288 --> 27:39.417
- Oh, yeah.
- Know what?

27:39.423 --> 27:41.319
I bet that's what she said, didn't she?

27:41.325 --> 27:43.221
Oh, yeah!

27:43.227 --> 27:45.757
Oh, Dan!

27:45.763 --> 27:47.158
- Big boy.
- (growling): All right, all right!

27:47.164 --> 27:48.893
Fine.

27:48.899 --> 27:51.062
Yes. It's my fault.

27:51.068 --> 27:53.331
I leaked the information to Charlotte.

27:53.337 --> 27:54.699
Among other things.

27:54.705 --> 27:57.176
I'm why she knew Chloe
was first at the scene.

27:57.201 --> 27:59.871
She must have looked at my
text messages after we...

27:59.877 --> 28:00.839
You what?

28:00.845 --> 28:02.707
Made... love.

28:02.713 --> 28:05.280
You slept with my... M-arlotte?

28:06.717 --> 28:07.846
You bastard!

28:07.852 --> 28:09.384
Whoa!

28:10.454 --> 28:12.588
(grunting)

28:13.147 --> 28:15.409
(guns clicking)

28:15.434 --> 28:16.955
Oh, now look what you've done.

28:16.961 --> 28:18.794
Wha...?

28:25.810 --> 28:28.406
Da-da... Don't be a Dan.

28:28.412 --> 28:30.509
I'll deal with this.

28:30.515 --> 28:31.543
Right.

28:31.549 --> 28:33.582
Which one of you chaps is in charge?

28:34.619 --> 28:36.581
Oh, very well.

28:38.790 --> 28:40.519
DAN: You speak Chinese?

28:40.525 --> 28:42.751
- What...?
- I'm the Devil.

28:42.776 --> 28:44.576
Of course I speak Chinese.
I speak everything.

CHLOE: <i>Dan's got a lead</i>

31:47.445 --> 31:49.808
on Boris' killer,
and it may implicate Perry.

So, if he is responsible,
it might not matter

31:51.983 --> 31:53.912
what happens in this trial.

31:53.918 --> 31:56.081
Well, that's great, 'cause we

31:56.087 --> 31:57.482
Well. I have to testify next.

I just hope I don't make things worse.

31:59.023 --> 32:00.719
Oh, you'll do great, honey. You're a pro.

32:00.725 --> 32:02.988
Right, Mom. A real pro.

32:02.994 --> 32:04.723
Like when I followed the prison van.

32:04.748 --> 32:07.325
Mom, what if I'm the reason
Dad's killer goes free?

32:07.331 --> 32:08.460
Don't you dare.

32:08.466 --> 32:10.762
No father in the world was
more proud of his daughter

32:10.768 --> 32:11.796
than your dad.

32:11.802 --> 32:14.232
And nothing you could do in that courtroom

32:14.238 --> 32:16.501
or anywhere will ever change that.

32:16.507 --> 32:18.036
(footsteps)

32:18.042 --> 32:19.971
I just miss him.

32:19.977 --> 32:22.974
I want him to get the
justice he deserves.

32:22.980 --> 32:25.577
Justice is what we all want, dear.

32:25.583 --> 32:27.345
For your father,

32:27.351 --> 32:29.084
and for my client.

32:32.790 --> 32:33.985
You're a mother.

32:33.991 --> 32:35.220
Aren't you?

32:35.226 --> 32:36.321
Yes.

32:36.327 --> 32:38.460
Then shame on you.

32:43.901 --> 32:46.635
We need to talk.

32:51.275 --> 32:52.871
Man, he better be here.

32:52.877 --> 32:54.339
If we can convince him to give up Perry,

32:54.345 --> 32:57.075
I won't feel so bad about
having slept with Charl...

32:57.081 --> 32:58.610
La la la la! No more talk

32:58.616 --> 33:00.845
of that disgusting offense, please.

33:00.851 --> 33:03.748
I thought you said you
hadn't slept with her.

33:03.754 --> 33:06.551
I haven't, wouldn't ever.

33:06.557 --> 33:08.186
I'm just upset for the detective.

33:08.192 --> 33:09.254
What, you think I'm not?

33:09.260 --> 33:10.488
I would do anything to right this.

33:10.494 --> 33:12.728
(sighs): I know you would.

33:18.803 --> 33:21.970
LAPD! Put your hands where I can see 'em!

33:26.177 --> 33:27.309
Whoa!

33:29.246 --> 33:31.776
Well, looks like we found Boris,

33:31.782 --> 33:33.545
at the head of the table, ironically.

33:33.551 --> 33:36.414
And that's Da Young.
I'd say we were right.

33:36.420 --> 33:38.283
Perry hired him to go
behind the Triad's back

33:38.289 --> 33:40.585
to kill Boris, knowing that
they'd punish him for it.

33:40.591 --> 33:43.221
Clever Perry,
killed two birds with one stone.

33:43.227 --> 33:45.661
Three, if you count the chicken.

33:52.320 --> 33:53.897
CHLOE: <i>You've got a lot of nerve.</i>

33:53.922 --> 33:55.338
Yes, I've been told.

33:55.344 --> 33:56.472
And legs for days.

33:56.478 --> 33:58.975
Now, listen, you're losing bad.

33:58.981 --> 34:00.643
Without Boris, the prosecution's evidence

34:00.649 --> 34:02.178
is mostly circumstantial.

34:02.184 --> 34:03.646
And, unfortunately for you,

34:03.652 --> 34:05.214
Lucifer's testimony basically handed me

34:05.220 --> 34:06.782
a non-guilty verdict.

34:06.788 --> 34:08.684
This trial is over.

34:08.690 --> 34:10.418
Maybe.

34:10.425 --> 34:12.989
But the investigation into that monster

34:12.995 --> 34:15.658
that you call a client is ongoing.

34:15.664 --> 34:17.092
So one way or another,

34:17.099 --> 34:19.862
- he wi...
- (cell phone rings)

34:19.868 --> 34:21.630
Hmm.

34:21.637 --> 34:22.735
Bad news?

34:23.705 --> 34:25.237
I may have a solution.

34:27.109 --> 34:29.839
My client isn't fully
aware we're winning.

34:29.844 --> 34:31.306
However, he is more than aware

34:31.313 --> 34:32.742
that he's facing the death penalty.

34:32.748 --> 34:35.844
And we both know he's a coward.

34:35.851 --> 34:37.612
I could use the possibility

34:37.619 --> 34:40.349
of a lethal injection to
get him to plead guilty.

34:40.355 --> 34:41.550
You're supposed to be on his side.

34:41.556 --> 34:42.518
Why are you doing this?

34:42.524 --> 34:44.954
Well, there is one condition.

34:44.960 --> 34:46.659
You'd have to betray Lucifer.

34:48.664 --> 34:50.192
So...

34:50.197 --> 34:52.928
you want Perry to go to jail,

34:52.934 --> 34:54.830
call Lucifer a liar.

34:54.835 --> 34:56.831
"A liar"?

34:56.838 --> 35:00.803
If there's one thing he cares
about more than anything,

35:00.809 --> 35:03.376
it's his honor.

35:04.713 --> 35:06.146
See you in court.

35:07.749 --> 35:09.011
(clears her throat)

35:09.017 --> 35:10.279
MOM: <i>Detective Decker,</i>

35:10.304 --> 35:12.643
Lucifer Morningstar is
your partner, correct?

35:12.649 --> 35:13.482
Yes.

35:13.488 --> 35:16.619
He's a civilian consultant for the LAPD.

35:16.625 --> 35:17.753
We work cases together.

35:17.759 --> 35:19.922
And how is he qualified for this role?

35:19.928 --> 35:23.626
He is very, uh, intuitive.

35:23.632 --> 35:26.729
He, um, understands people's desires.

35:26.735 --> 35:28.297
MOM: And in addition to that,

35:28.303 --> 35:30.070
I assume he studied law enforcement?

35:32.441 --> 35:34.303
Not to my knowledge, no.

35:34.309 --> 35:36.246
MOM: Oh, okay.

35:36.271 --> 35:37.907
But he has a professional background,

35:37.913 --> 35:40.142
which is somehow relevant
to law enforcement?

35:40.148 --> 35:41.243
He owns a nightclub.

35:41.249 --> 35:43.179
MOM: Okay, but then,

35:43.185 --> 35:44.647
I'm sure his previous job

35:44.653 --> 35:45.881
was more relevant to his role

35:45.887 --> 35:47.850
as a civilian consultant for the LAPD?

35:47.856 --> 35:49.752
- Right?
- Mm.

35:49.758 --> 35:52.121
Well, if you believe his claims

35:52.127 --> 35:53.789
that he used to run Hell...

35:53.795 --> 35:56.892
(chokes, clears throat)

35:56.898 --> 36:00.930
...then yes, he's accustomed
to punishing bad guys.

36:00.936 --> 36:02.264
(muffled murmurs)

36:02.270 --> 36:03.566
It's true.

36:03.572 --> 36:05.267
I'm confused, Detective.

36:05.273 --> 36:09.171
Are you suggesting your
partner is delusional,

36:09.177 --> 36:10.744
or just lying?

36:15.517 --> 36:19.615
Lucifer Morningstar is many things,

36:19.621 --> 36:21.917
but he is not a liar.

36:21.923 --> 36:25.588
Everything that Mr. Morningstar said

36:25.594 --> 36:28.257
on this stand is absolutely true.

36:28.263 --> 36:31.193
I was the first person
on that crime scene.

36:31.199 --> 36:33.963
And, yes, I shouldn't have
been anywhere near it.

36:33.969 --> 36:36.832
But I...

36:36.838 --> 36:39.568
let my emotions

36:39.574 --> 36:41.741
get the best of me.

36:43.979 --> 36:46.409
(clears her throat)

36:46.415 --> 36:48.047
Lucifer is the...

36:49.980 --> 36:52.515
...best partner

36:52.521 --> 36:54.483
I have ever had.

36:54.489 --> 36:58.954
And I can only hope that
he can count on me

36:58.960 --> 37:02.506
as much as I count on him.

37:02.531 --> 37:04.693
STEDMAN: Your Honor,
we request the jury be instructed

37:04.699 --> 37:08.397
to disregard Detective
Decker's entire testimony.

37:08.403 --> 37:10.837
We'll take a ten-minute recess.

37:26.603 --> 37:28.017
(overlapping reporter chatter)

37:28.023 --> 37:29.118
REPORTER: Harry, are you surprised

37:29.124 --> 37:30.386
by that "not guilty" verdict?

37:30.392 --> 37:32.455
No. I'm never surprised
to see justice served.

37:32.461 --> 37:33.989
I believe in our legal system.

37:33.995 --> 37:35.424
And now I can finally return to my family

37:35.430 --> 37:37.159
a free man, so, if you'll excuse me.

37:37.165 --> 37:38.661
(cameras clicking)

37:38.667 --> 37:42.202
(reporters calling for Chloe)

37:44.206 --> 37:47.106
(seagulls squawking)

38:05.060 --> 38:07.756
I'm sorry to bother you, um, I was, um...

38:07.762 --> 38:10.025
I'm looking for Maze.

38:10.031 --> 38:11.260
Do you know what apartment she lives in?

38:11.266 --> 38:14.634
Oh, yes, but she's not home.

38:16.171 --> 38:18.133
Why, did you get in a fight?

38:18.139 --> 38:19.760
(laughs)

38:19.785 --> 38:21.403
I'm sorry, it's none of my business.

38:21.409 --> 38:26.242
It's just, my husband...

38:26.248 --> 38:28.911
always gave me flowers after an argument.

38:28.917 --> 38:31.985

38:40.295 --> 38:42.391

38:42.397 --> 38:44.493
everything happens for a reason.

Me, neither.

But I do know that no
matter how bad things get,

38:55.176 --> 38:57.940
the true test is how we choose to respond

35 years ago, Father,

42:03.665 --> 42:04.927
He asked me to come down here

42:04.933 --> 42:07.162
to bless a couple who was
unable to have a child.
