17:02.355 --> 17:05.142
MIGHT FALL SLIGHTLY OUTSIDE
YOUR LAWS,

17:05.358 --> 17:08.816
BUT ALL I WAS DOING
WAS HONORING DAVID'S WISHES.

17:09.029 --> 17:11.771
BY BURNING HIS BODY
ON A RAISED PLATFORM?

17:11.990 --> 17:15.198
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
A TRADITIONAL CHEYENNE BURIAL.

FROM MANY TRIBES.

YOU THREATENED HIM.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.327

TO TEST THEM,

17:26.421 --> 17:29.458
YOU WOULD COME AFTER HIM.

17:29.674 --> 17:32.416

OF THE CHEYENNE NATION

17:35.555 --> 17:37.136

ABOUT SPIRITS,

17:40.936 --> 17:44.849

ABOUT BAD FORTUNE.

17:45.065 --> 17:48.057

THREE HOURS AGO.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.021
HE WENT BACK OUT

17:51.238 --> 17:55.197

NOT TO GO, AND HE GOT SHOT.

I DID IT?

AN EVEN BETTER ALIBI,

18:28.441 --> 18:31.808

18:33.321 --> 18:38.315

ON HIS FACE AND BODY.

18:41.997 --> 18:44.113

19:16.740 --> 19:19.402
