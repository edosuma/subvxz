00:02.869 --> 00:05.505
-[Lulu] I'm a giant!
-[True] I'm a giant!

00:05.572 --> 00:07.207
-I'm a giant!
-I'm a giant!

00:07.774 --> 00:09.609
-I'm a giant!
-I'm a giant!

00:09.676 --> 00:12.979
-I'm a Giant!
-Lulu, keep it down.

00:13.046 --> 00:14.247
Why? Who's gonna hear us?

00:14.314 --> 00:16.783
[Madigan] True, is that you?

00:16.850 --> 00:17.584
Any other questions?

00:17.650 --> 00:18.618
[Madigan] Come in here.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.155
Now try to make yourself
look presentable.

00:22.222 --> 00:24.657
This is a professional office.

00:24.724 --> 00:26.860
Mr. Madigan!

00:27.560 --> 00:28.561
What are you doing?

00:28.628 --> 00:30.497
Well, I'm in a bit of a pickle.

00:30.563 --> 00:32.565
This morning Doris
took off her wedding ring

00:32.632 --> 00:33.867
while she was doing the dishes

00:33.933 --> 00:36.202
and I noticed a small
crack in the ring.

00:36.269 --> 00:37.537
See!

00:37.604 --> 00:38.705
So?

00:38.772 --> 00:40.907
So if Doris sees the
crack in the ring,

00:40.974 --> 00:42.976
she'll think there's a
crack in the marriage.

00:43.042 --> 00:44.811
She's terribly superstitious.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.346
Why don't you just take
it to a jeweler?

00:46.413 --> 00:47.981
Because I'm even
more superstitious.

00:48.047 --> 00:50.216
I believe if I walk
into a jewelry store,

00:50.283 --> 00:53.219
I will activate the crack
in the marriage.

00:53.286 --> 00:54.654
You want me to take
it in for you?

00:54.721 --> 00:55.588
Would you?

00:55.655 --> 00:56.656
Sure, I'll do it
tomorrow morning.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.091
It can't wait til tomorrow.

00:58.158 --> 01:00.894
I've sent Doris to an exclusive
day spa for two days,

01:00.960 --> 01:02.962
so I'd have time to fix it.
You have to hurry.

01:03.029 --> 01:05.799
But I've got a catalog shoot to
take care of, boys wear.

01:05.865 --> 01:07.200
Ooh.

01:07.267 --> 01:10.570
Don't worry about the shoot.
I'll have Amanda cover it.

01:10.637 --> 01:12.806
Huh, I'm sure she'll love that.

01:12.872 --> 01:16.009
In case you couldn't tell,
I was being sarcastic.

01:18.511 --> 01:20.447
10:15 Pickup!
10:15 Pickup!

01:20.513 --> 01:22.849
Oscar, let's go, let's go.
The mail waits for no man.

01:22.916 --> 01:26.519
This is not a drill.
This is not a drill.

01:26.586 --> 01:27.854
True, I need that vest.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.055
Okay, why?

01:29.122 --> 01:30.523
It's going to a
fashion show in Paris, remember?

01:30.590 --> 01:33.960
10:15 pickup! Whoo!

01:35.595 --> 01:38.164
Well, I've got a ton
of work to do.

01:38.231 --> 01:39.232
Like what?

01:39.299 --> 01:41.067
I'm gonna brush my pony's hair.

01:43.503 --> 01:46.139
Ryan, what are you doing?

01:46.206 --> 01:47.941
Pretending to be a statue.

01:48.007 --> 01:49.709
Forget I asked.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.277
I was walking to work
this morning, right?

01:51.344 --> 01:53.613
And by work, you don't
mean here, do you?

01:53.680 --> 01:55.248
Yeah.

01:55.315 --> 01:58.418
Anyway, I saw this guy painted
gold, pretending to be a statue,

01:58.485 --> 01:59.586
and all these people
were getting their

01:59.652 --> 02:00.820
picture taken with him.

02:00.887 --> 02:02.489
And then they'd
give him a dollar.

02:02.555 --> 02:03.823
It's the third easiest
job in this town,

02:03.890 --> 02:06.059
right after mayor
and whatever Lulu does.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.760
Hey, Lulu works hard.

02:07.827 --> 02:09.963
Mind if I take off?
I'm pretty bored.

02:12.265 --> 02:13.566
What's with him?

02:13.633 --> 02:15.835
Ryan's thinking about
becoming a human statue.

02:15.902 --> 02:18.705
Oh, cool.
And he won't move at all?

02:18.771 --> 02:19.639
Mm-Mm.

02:19.706 --> 02:22.141
Not even if I do this?

02:25.111 --> 02:27.113
Oh, gross!

02:28.348 --> 02:31.150
What are you laughing at?
You had your finger in his ear.

02:31.217 --> 02:33.686
Oh, gross!

02:34.754 --> 02:36.422
Oh, hey, did you want me
to find a repair place?

02:36.489 --> 02:37.357
For what?

02:37.423 --> 02:38.925
Miss Aidem's ring.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.227
Oh, I forgot all about it.
What is with my memory today?

02:41.294 --> 02:43.396
Where did I put that thing?

02:43.463 --> 02:47.500
Oh, no, the vest!
I put the ring in the vest!

02:48.468 --> 02:50.803
Oscar, have you seen Jimmy?

02:51.671 --> 02:53.406
Jimmy, where's that
vest I gave you?

02:53.473 --> 02:55.875
Don't worry.
It's on its way to Paris.

02:56.409 --> 02:58.411

03:48.127 --> 03:49.262
No luck.

03:49.329 --> 03:50.396
The plane took off
five minutes ago.

03:50.463 --> 03:51.998
That ring's on its way to Paris.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.233
Well, can I get someone to send
it back as soon as it arrives?

03:54.300 --> 03:55.635
No, can do.
I talked to all my guys,

03:55.702 --> 03:59.238
Vern, Deb, Larry, Dana,
Ronnie Vail, Gordie, Jim.

03:59.305 --> 04:00.873
We don't need to
know everyone's name.

04:00.940 --> 04:03.042
Still, it's pretty impressive
how many people I know,

04:03.109 --> 04:05.244
Bernie, Rich, Nya, Rasheed.

04:05.311 --> 04:06.646
Ahem, what do you think
Mr. Madigan's gonna say

04:06.713 --> 04:08.114
when he finds out that
you sent Miss Aidem's

04:08.181 --> 04:09.415
wedding ring to Paris?

04:09.482 --> 04:11.317
He can't find out.
He trusted me.

04:11.384 --> 04:13.486
We're just gonna have to go
to Paris and get it back.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.588
-I don't know about that.
-Why not?

04:15.655 --> 04:17.790
International flights are almost
impossible to get tickets for.

04:17.857 --> 04:19.726
I can try calling some
of my airplane connections,

04:19.792 --> 04:21.394
Leon, Bill, Danny, Bex.

04:21.461 --> 04:23.029
Jimmy.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.098
I've got a better idea.

04:25.164 --> 04:28.234
Oh, yeah.

04:28.301 --> 04:31.104
I don't actually know
what we're nodding about.

04:38.177 --> 04:39.746
Are you sure this is gonna work?

04:39.812 --> 04:41.514
Nope.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.483
Excuse me, I have a very
important meeting to get to.

04:43.549 --> 04:45.418
Is the Paris flight on time?

04:45.485 --> 04:46.853
What are you asking us for?

04:46.919 --> 04:48.454
Aren't you flight attendants?

04:48.521 --> 04:49.756
Yes, we are.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.758
And as far as we know, ma'am,
the flight is on time.

04:51.824 --> 04:53.026
Well, it better be.

04:53.092 --> 04:54.894
I have a very important
meeting to get to.

04:54.961 --> 04:58.164
Yeah, you said that.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.565
It's very important.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.701
A lot of bigwigs,
a lot of bigwigs.

05:01.768 --> 05:04.303
There's even talk that
Mr. Nakamura may be there.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.806
And you're wearing that?

05:07.674 --> 05:10.977
Thank you for flying
Galaxy Airlines!

05:11.044 --> 05:13.846
-Lulu.
-She started it.

05:17.917 --> 05:20.687
Thank you for flying Galaxy.
Here's your pillow, Miss.

05:20.753 --> 05:22.822
I asked for headphones.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.724
Yes, of course.

05:25.224 --> 05:26.526
Do you know where
they keep them?

05:26.592 --> 05:28.695
No.

05:30.596 --> 05:32.298
Here you go.

05:32.365 --> 05:34.567
Hello, little girl,
can I get you something?

05:34.634 --> 05:36.703
May I please have Baba cheese?

05:36.769 --> 05:37.837
I'm sorry, what?

05:37.904 --> 05:39.439
May I please have Baba cheese?

05:39.505 --> 05:42.642
-I'm sorry, what?
-Baba cheese!

05:45.645 --> 05:49.082
This job's kind of a hassle.
Everybody wants something.

05:49.148 --> 05:51.117
What'cha making?

05:51.184 --> 05:54.020
Either hot chocolate or lasagna.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.822
These bags aren't
marked very well.

05:55.888 --> 05:59.092
If you find anything labeled
Baba cheese, let me know.

05:59.158 --> 06:00.693
There's one of the real flight
attendants.

06:00.760 --> 06:04.497
Act busy.

06:06.632 --> 06:07.734
What do you think you're doing?

06:07.800 --> 06:09.502
Cleaning out this pot.

06:09.569 --> 06:12.338
The nun in 6F asked for
peanuts 10 minutes ago.

06:12.405 --> 06:14.040
I've already given
her three bags.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.375
What is she, an elephant?

06:16.442 --> 06:18.111
I need the two of you
to take care of passengers,

06:18.177 --> 06:20.279
while I check
on the vector capacitor.

06:20.346 --> 06:21.881
What's that?

06:21.948 --> 06:24.050
It's complicated airplane talk.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.585
Sounds more like gibberish.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.754
-It does, doesn't it?
-Yeah.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.188
Hi, one more question.

06:29.255 --> 06:30.423
Do you know if the
flight transducers

06:30.490 --> 06:31.724
have been calibrated?

06:31.791 --> 06:32.458
They have indeed.

06:32.525 --> 06:35.528
Ha! Made that one up.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.463
Hey, you're a kid.

06:37.530 --> 06:39.398
Ah, that is the most
outrageous thing!

06:39.465 --> 06:42.368
Okay, don't tell anyone.

06:42.435 --> 06:45.438
Don't worry, I won't tell.
I'm a kid too.

06:45.505 --> 06:48.040
You are?
What's the meaning of this?

06:48.107 --> 06:50.510
Lulu.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.812
-What's your name?
-Vanessa.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.113
I'm True
and this is Lulu.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.581
Hi.

06:55.648 --> 06:58.985
So why are you pretending
to be a flight attendant?

06:59.051 --> 07:00.253
I'm running away.

07:00.319 --> 07:01.621
From where?

07:01.687 --> 07:03.623
Home.

07:03.689 --> 07:06.926
My mom just got remarried
and I want a new dad

07:06.993 --> 07:09.428
about as much as the lady
in 2B wants a blanket.

07:09.495 --> 07:11.564
Yeah, what is with her?
I tried handing her one

07:11.631 --> 07:13.332
and she tried to throw it
out the window.

07:13.399 --> 07:14.467
Yeah,
which for the record,

07:14.534 --> 07:16.936
would have torn
the plane in half.

07:17.003 --> 07:18.538
What are you doing here?

07:18.604 --> 07:21.908
We've gotta get a vest back from
Paris before my boss finds out.

07:21.974 --> 07:23.910
It's sort of a long story.

07:23.976 --> 07:27.046
Well, I'll keep your secret
if you keep mine.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.248
Deal.

07:29.315 --> 07:32.451
Which one of turds
stole my headphones?

07:37.957 --> 07:39.859
Oscar, where are the boys
for the catalog shoot?

07:39.926 --> 07:41.794
I've been waiting in the
conference room for 20 minutes.

07:41.861 --> 07:43.029
Aren't you in charge
of the shoot?

07:43.095 --> 07:44.664
Yes.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.265
Well, doesn't the person in
charge usually hire the models?

07:46.332 --> 07:48.401
Sweet cinnamon,
there are no models?

07:48.467 --> 07:50.770
Where am I going to find a boy
model on zero notice?

07:50.837 --> 07:52.872
[elevator ding]

07:55.641 --> 07:59.712
Jimmy, how would like
to model for me?

07:59.779 --> 08:03.416
Oh, I don't think
I'd be any good at that.

08:06.385 --> 08:08.955
Oh, sure you would.
Come on.

08:09.021 --> 08:11.591
Nah.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.128
-But you--
-I don't think so.

08:16.195 --> 08:18.331
Fine, forget it.

08:18.397 --> 08:20.933
I guess I'll have to
cancel the shoot.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.807
Oscar, do you see what I see?

08:27.874 --> 08:29.642
A dopey kid hitting
a rubber ball?

08:29.709 --> 08:31.777
No, a young George Clooney
hitting a rubber ball.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.713
Ryan, come closer.

08:33.779 --> 08:35.715
You're not gonna punch me,
are you?

08:35.781 --> 08:39.418
Punch you?
No, I want to shoot you.

08:39.485 --> 08:41.454
Technically,
that would be worse.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.756
No, shoot you
for a fashion catalog.

08:43.823 --> 08:47.693
Why have I never noticed how
ruggedly striking you are?

08:47.760 --> 08:50.329
I am pretty ruggedly striking.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.699
Meet me in the conference room
in 15 minutes.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.605
Kelsey,

08:59.672 --> 09:03.175
guess who's gonna be a major
international male model?

09:03.242 --> 09:05.278
Nope, guess again.

09:05.344 --> 09:06.746
Guess again.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.382
Guess again.

09:10.016 --> 09:13.686
Okay, I'm just gonna cut
to the chase, it's me.

09:13.753 --> 09:16.822
No, not somebody named me,
like actually me.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.393
Hello?

09:26.432 --> 09:27.600
We do crazy stuff all the time.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.168
We got to meet Justin Bieber.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.236
You did not.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.537
-Yes.
-Yes.

09:31.604 --> 09:33.372
We pretended to be
pizza delivery guys.

09:33.439 --> 09:36.142
[phone ringing]

the safety lecture.

down the hall and--

Wait, you really don't
want to disturb a model

14:20.492 --> 14:22.995

in something stupid?

here until he's done?

How long have you
been doing that?

on 34th Street.

their size fool you.

touch the radio station.

Spanish soap opera.

mind about running away.

Look, I don't know anything
about your stepdad,

16:18.043 --> 16:19.712
but there's gotta be
something good about him.

16:19.778 --> 16:21.513
Why else would your mom
marry him?

16:21.580 --> 16:23.415
He makes her laugh.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.050
Like you need a husband
to do that.

16:25.117 --> 16:28.187
I mean, I laugh all day long and
I don't even have a boyfriend.

16:28.253 --> 16:29.988

have a dog.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.620
And your mom comes in
and pulls off your socks?

17:01.687 --> 17:03.088
You kinda of yell
at her to knock it off,

17:03.155 --> 17:08.660
but really, you're super glad
she pulled off your socks.

17:08.727 --> 17:11.196

as we get there,

17:24.042 --> 17:25.644
we have to find our way
to the fashion show.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.045
Then we'll have to sneak
backstage, find the model,

17:27.112 --> 17:29.815
get the vest,
get the ring and get out.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.718
Great. And then if there's time,
we can go rob Fort Knox.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.019
What's the problem?

17:34.086 --> 17:35.354
Well, for one,

dressed like stewardesses.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.191
Yeah, you're right.

17:39.258 --> 17:41.760
It'd sure be better
if we had some real clothes.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.898

17:45.964 --> 17:47.599

lady's yellow suitcase

17:47.666 --> 17:50.202
and use the money
to buy some clothes?

17:51.770 --> 17:53.872
How much longer, blind Pete?

17:53.939 --> 17:56.241
Don't worry.
I know shortcut.

18:05.117 --> 18:06.685
We are here.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.754

18:08.821 --> 18:10.689
I guess this is goodbye.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.691
I guess so.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.060
Good luck on whatever
you decide to do.

and skyscrapers.

is strictly off limits.

We're on the list.

19:21.293 --> 19:22.361

were fashion critics.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.805
Dang.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.608
What are we gonna do?

19:36.675 --> 19:39.077
-We've gotta distract him.
-Good idea.

19:39.545 --> 19:42.848
Whoa, that's the biggest
baguette I've ever seen.

19:42.915 --> 19:46.485
It looks like a
warm, crusty canoe.

to distract me

of a giant baguette?

19:50.088 --> 19:51.056
Sort of.

You must take me
for a fool. Still.

you're not lying,

19:57.362 --> 19:59.531
I'd hate to miss out
on this warm, crusty baguette

19:59.598 --> 20:01.433
you speak so fondly of.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.136
Okay, Lulu.

20:04.202 --> 20:05.737
Now keep your eyes open for a
vest with colorful buttons.

20:05.804 --> 20:07.372
Got it.

20:07.439 --> 20:09.708
What the?

20:09.775 --> 20:11.977
Everybody's wearing a vest.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.880
That girl's wearing two vests.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.082
Come on, Lulu,
let's find that ring.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.684
Excuse me, I was wondering if
there might be

20:18.750 --> 20:19.618
a ring in your pocket.

20:19.685 --> 20:20.953
[speaking French]

20:21.019 --> 20:22.220
A ring in your pocket.

20:22.287 --> 20:23.622
[speaking French]

20:23.689 --> 20:26.124
A ring in your pockets?
A ring in your--

20:26.191 --> 20:28.927
I don't have time for this!

20:29.361 --> 20:30.429
Lulu, anything?

20:30.495 --> 20:31.964
Nothing.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.373
True, Lulu!

20:42.040 --> 20:43.742
Are you looking
for a wedding ring?

20:43.809 --> 20:45.410
Mr. Madigan,
what are you doing here?

20:45.477 --> 20:47.846
I got a call that a certain
ring popped up in the pocket

20:47.913 --> 20:50.682
of our model, so I hopped
on a plane and came here.

20:50.749 --> 20:51.984
Your private jet?

20:52.050 --> 20:53.919
No, actually I forgot
I had a private jet

20:53.986 --> 20:55.487
and I flew commercial.

20:55.554 --> 20:57.022
Now would you care to explain?

20:57.089 --> 20:59.124
Well, I put the ring
in the pocket of the vest.

20:59.191 --> 21:01.293
I guess it just went
straight out of my head.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.227
I'm sorry.

21:02.294 --> 21:03.595
You're sorry?

21:03.662 --> 21:05.497
Do you have any idea what's
going to happen when Doris

21:05.564 --> 21:06.431
breaks out of that seaweed wrap

21:06.498 --> 21:08.667
and discovers the
ring is missing?

21:08.734 --> 21:10.068
-You're not gonna believe this.
-What?

21:10.135 --> 21:12.537
I had a seaweed wrap for lunch.

21:12.604 --> 21:16.908
I'm going to be sleeping in the
dog house this time, literally.

21:16.975 --> 21:18.343
You have a dog house?

21:18.410 --> 21:20.445
No, that's what we call our
estate in the Hamptons.

21:20.512 --> 21:22.514
It's actually quite lovely.
It's right on the water.

21:22.581 --> 21:24.316
We should have you out.

21:24.383 --> 21:26.251
Mr. Madigan, shouldn't we
be looking for the ring?

21:26.318 --> 21:29.221
Yes, yes, yes.
We just have to find our model.

21:29.287 --> 21:31.189
I understand she's
wearing a green headband

21:31.256 --> 21:33.825
with a yellow disc with a
little red heart inside it.

21:33.892 --> 21:35.827
-There she is.
-Her?

21:35.894 --> 21:38.196
No, the girl next to her.

21:38.930 --> 21:39.965
Excuse me, young miss.

21:40.032 --> 21:41.600
I believe you have
something of mine.

21:41.667 --> 21:42.668
Are you speaking of the ring?

21:42.734 --> 21:43.902
That's right.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.303
We'll just take it
and be on our way.

21:45.370 --> 21:46.972
I'm afraid I'm no longer
in possession of the ring.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.306
Well, then who is?

21:48.373 --> 21:50.208
Me.

21:50.275 --> 21:51.576
Who are you?

21:51.643 --> 21:54.513
I go by many names.

21:54.579 --> 21:57.349
But you can call me,

21:57.416 --> 22:00.118
Neil.

22:00.185 --> 22:01.687
-Hi, Neil.
-I like your jacket.

22:01.753 --> 22:02.988
Thanks, I just got it.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.256
You don't think the
sleeves are too short?

22:04.322 --> 22:05.891
-No.
-Really? These buttons-

22:05.957 --> 22:09.828
Ahem, Neil,

22:09.895 --> 22:12.431
do you know where
my wife's ring is?

22:12.497 --> 22:16.902
The ring is being kept safe
by none other than

22:16.968 --> 22:18.570
Karl Gustav.

22:18.637 --> 22:20.172
[gasps]

22:20.238 --> 22:21.707
-I don't know who that is.
-Neither do I.

22:21.773 --> 22:23.075
Yes, who is that?

22:23.141 --> 22:24.476
He's a very powerful man.

22:24.543 --> 22:26.111
There's a car waiting for you
out front to take you

22:26.178 --> 22:27.546
to the Gustav mansion.

22:27.612 --> 22:30.015
[speaking French]

22:33.819 --> 22:36.121
It means follow me.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.497
Mr. Gustav is not
the sort of man

22:45.564 --> 22:47.365
who likes to be kept waiting.

22:47.432 --> 22:49.367
Yes, speaking of Mr. Gustav,

22:49.434 --> 22:51.169
what exactly is
he doing with my ring?

22:51.236 --> 22:53.939
That is a question you'll
have to ask him yourself.

22:54.005 --> 22:55.674
I've got a question.
Who decorated this place?

22:55.741 --> 22:57.609
Scary Von Boogeyman?

22:57.676 --> 22:59.377
Lulu, don't be rude.
Someone lives here.

22:59.444 --> 23:00.612
I'm just saying,

23:00.679 --> 23:02.047
would it kill him
to buy a few plants?

23:02.114 --> 23:04.082
Maybe put in a skylight?

23:04.149 --> 23:07.285
In. Oh, be careful.
There's a little step.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.358
[locks locking]

23:13.425 --> 23:14.626
That's a lot of locks.

23:14.693 --> 23:16.895
[locks locking]

23:16.962 --> 23:19.965
There's no doorknob
on this side of the door.

23:20.031 --> 23:22.834
I'm starting to get a bad
feeling about all this.

23:23.268 --> 23:24.436
What is this place?

23:24.503 --> 23:26.104
It looks like some
sort of design room.

23:26.171 --> 23:27.439
Look at all the fabric.

23:27.506 --> 23:28.907
-Not even!
-What?

23:28.974 --> 23:30.208
What is it?

23:30.275 --> 23:32.544
There's a book here called,
Ponies, Ponies, Ponies.

23:33.111 --> 23:35.046
What a rip-off.
It won't come out.

23:35.113 --> 23:36.481
[gasps]

23:36.548 --> 23:38.550
I take it you like ponies?

23:38.617 --> 23:39.818
Uh-huh.

23:39.885 --> 23:41.720
Do you believe
in magical ponies?

23:41.787 --> 23:45.957
Of course not.
Yes.

23:46.992 --> 23:48.794
I do too.

23:48.860 --> 23:49.494
Hi.

23:49.561 --> 23:50.862
Hello.

23:50.929 --> 23:53.231
Excuse me, but who are you?

23:53.298 --> 23:56.268
My name is Karl Gustav.

23:57.469 --> 24:00.772
And I'm an
international fancy-pants.

24:01.573 --> 24:02.941
Is that a real thing?

24:03.008 --> 24:04.876
Oh, indeed.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.779
Ahem, Mr. Gustav, what have
you done with my wife's ring?

24:07.846 --> 24:11.716
I assure you,
the ring is safe.

24:12.551 --> 24:14.119
How do you open this thing?

24:14.186 --> 24:18.857
You need the key of which
only I am in possession of.

24:23.862 --> 24:26.164
Listen, I like games just as
much as the next person,

24:26.231 --> 24:28.166
but can you just give us the
ring, so we can go home?

24:28.233 --> 24:30.702
I'm afraid you won't be going
anywhere.

24:31.803 --> 24:34.439
Well, then, we'll just have
to call the police.

24:34.506 --> 24:37.709
I own the police, and the Army,
and the National Guard,

24:37.776 --> 24:39.644
and the pet shop on the corner.

24:39.711 --> 24:42.480
Mention my name
for a free sparrow.

24:43.014 --> 24:45.183
I ordered too many sparrows.

24:47.052 --> 24:49.855
Mr. Gustav, you've been
a terrific host,

24:49.921 --> 24:51.356
but we should be
getting back to America.

24:51.423 --> 24:52.657
We have homework.

24:52.724 --> 24:56.494
Advanced calculus.
So hard.

24:56.561 --> 24:58.530
I will be perfectly happy
to let you go

24:58.597 --> 25:01.466
in exchange for one dress.

25:01.533 --> 25:03.168
You want us to design a dress?

25:03.235 --> 25:04.302
For my daughter.

25:04.369 --> 25:05.503
Easy-peasy.

25:05.570 --> 25:06.738
True can design a
dress in her sleep.

25:06.805 --> 25:08.473
She isn't kidding.
I do it all the time.

25:08.540 --> 25:09.808
I'll wake up with
a pen in one hand

25:09.875 --> 25:11.309
and a pair of scissors
in the other.

25:11.376 --> 25:14.312
That's why my parents
lock their door at night.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.115
I should warn you.

25:17.182 --> 25:21.286
My daughter has a particularly
finicky fashion sense.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.221
She hates everything.

25:23.288 --> 25:24.522
I've got a better idea.

25:24.589 --> 25:26.725
Why don't you just
go through our catalog

25:26.791 --> 25:28.126
and we'll ship you some choices?

25:28.193 --> 25:29.961
I'm afraid that
won't work for us.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.796
Good day.

25:34.766 --> 25:36.401
Does this sort of thing
happen a lot?

25:36.468 --> 25:38.970
Not a lot.

25:44.809 --> 25:47.579
I'm sorry to bother you,
but did you drive here?

25:47.646 --> 25:49.547
As a matter of fact,
I did. Why?

25:49.614 --> 25:52.584
I may need to borrow
your car to escape.

25:52.651 --> 25:53.952
Escape from what?

25:54.019 --> 25:57.455
Well, don't tell anyone,
but I'm robbing the bank.

25:57.522 --> 25:59.824
Shh.

26:01.293 --> 26:03.695
I wouldn't deposit that.

26:05.497 --> 26:07.332
Hello.

26:11.536 --> 26:12.671
That's nice.

26:12.737 --> 26:14.205
Well, thank you.
That's nice, too.

26:14.272 --> 26:15.440
Thank you.

26:15.507 --> 26:17.909
I'm hungry. Do either of you
have a cheeseburger?

26:17.976 --> 26:20.645
Let me check.
No.

26:20.712 --> 26:23.148
You didn't check.

26:23.214 --> 26:24.783
I wonder if Mr. Gustav's
daughter is gonna be

26:24.849 --> 26:26.184
as weird as he is.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.186
Oh, I wouldn't think so.
I've traveled the world over

26:28.253 --> 26:29.854
and I find that children
tend to be as sweet as--

26:29.921 --> 26:32.157
Can it, windbag.

26:33.692 --> 26:35.760
Now where's my dress?

26:35.827 --> 26:38.063
We're working on some designs
for you now.

26:38.129 --> 26:38.797
I hate them.

26:38.863 --> 26:40.732
You haven't seen them.

26:40.799 --> 26:42.734
I hate them.

26:43.635 --> 26:44.903
Well, what are you looking for?

26:44.970 --> 26:46.638
The most beautiful dress
in the world.

26:46.705 --> 26:47.906
Very good.

26:47.973 --> 26:49.474
Are there any particular
colors you prefer?

26:49.541 --> 26:50.442
I hate colors.

26:50.508 --> 26:51.943
You hate colors?
Excellent.

26:52.010 --> 26:53.345
True, she's all yours.

26:53.411 --> 26:55.714
Oh, what do you think
about a simple black dress?

26:55.780 --> 26:58.917
It sounds great
for my fireplace.

26:59.851 --> 27:02.654
Okay, how about a cute
little top and pants?

27:02.721 --> 27:04.789
Fireplace?

27:04.856 --> 27:07.092
I just wanna be beautiful.

27:07.158 --> 27:09.661
If you want, I can describe a
bunch of styles you might like.

27:09.728 --> 27:10.929
I don't have time for that.

27:10.996 --> 27:12.931
I'm gonna go watch
Yo Gabba Gabba.

27:12.998 --> 27:14.499
I'll be back later.

27:14.566 --> 27:17.002
Could you bring a cheeseburger
and three orders of fries?

27:17.502 --> 27:19.337
I got you guys some fries.

27:19.404 --> 27:21.139
Mr. Madigan, I'm thinking this
is gonna be a little harder

27:21.206 --> 27:22.340
than we thought.

27:22.407 --> 27:26.644
We've got to get out of here,
but how?

27:26.711 --> 27:27.846
I have a phone.

27:27.912 --> 27:29.047
They took our phones.

27:29.114 --> 27:31.249
I carry two of them, remember?

27:34.552 --> 27:36.321
[phone ringing]

27:36.388 --> 27:37.689
True's office.

27:37.756 --> 27:39.758
Hi Ryan, Lulu, me and Mr.
Madigan are being held captive.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.526
You have to come save us.

27:41.593 --> 27:44.162
Consider it done.
Where are you?

27:44.229 --> 27:45.463
Paris.

27:45.530 --> 27:47.432
I'm sorry, that almost sounded
like you said Paris.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.734
I did.

27:49.801 --> 27:51.936
How am I supposed
to get to Paris?

27:52.003 --> 27:55.006
Take Mr. Madigan's jet.
We're at the Gustav mansion.

27:55.073 --> 27:57.475
I've gotta go before they find
out we have a secret phone.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.546
Jimmy, we got a big problem.

28:01.613 --> 28:02.514
What's wrong?

28:02.580 --> 28:03.681
True just called from Paris.

28:03.748 --> 28:04.716
She's being held
in the Gustav mansion

28:04.783 --> 28:05.650
with Lulu and your uncle.

28:05.717 --> 28:06.985
Let's go.

28:07.052 --> 28:08.353
Wait, wait.
How are we gonna get there?

28:08.420 --> 28:09.521
Take Uncle Max's jet.

28:09.587 --> 28:10.855
That's what True said,

28:10.922 --> 28:12.390
but how long will it take us
to get a pilot?

28:12.457 --> 28:14.526
We don't need one.
I've got the keys.

28:18.997 --> 28:21.066
[Jimmy]<i> This is your captain</i>
<i>speaking.</i>

28:21.132 --> 28:22.367
[Ryan]<i> It's just me, Jimmy.</i>

28:22.434 --> 28:24.035
[Jimmy]<i> How are</i>
<i>y'all doing today?</i>

28:24.102 --> 28:25.537
[Ryan]<i> It's just me.</i>

28:25.603 --> 28:27.639
[Jimmy]<i> And now for</i>
<i>your in-flight enjoyment,</i>

28:27.705 --> 28:29.607
<i>fire and ice!</i>

28:32.977 --> 28:34.913
True, that hemline is terrific.

28:34.979 --> 28:36.247
Thanks, Mr. Madigan.

28:36.314 --> 28:37.715
I know she doesn't like colors,

28:37.782 --> 28:39.918
but how can anyone
resist sparkly gems?

28:39.984 --> 28:40.885
She'll love it.

28:40.952 --> 28:42.821
I hate it.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.023
Why? It's got everything.

28:45.090 --> 28:47.826
It's girly, but still,
yeah, what's up?

28:47.892 --> 28:49.227
And it's flattering,
but it isn't all,

28:49.294 --> 28:52.730
I know I look good.
Somebody get me a soda.

28:52.797 --> 28:54.966
It sure talks a lot
for an ugly dress.

28:55.033 --> 28:56.568
Perhaps there's a
specific element

28:56.634 --> 28:58.236
you're not responding to.

41:53.711 --> 41:55.179
Home to my wife.

41:55.246 --> 41:58.382
I'm afraid you won't.

41:58.449 --> 42:02.119
I'm afraid I will.
Let me just adjust my tie.

Oh, come on!

42:42.526 --> 42:43.761
What are we gonna do now?

42:43.827 --> 42:45.296
I guess Ryan's gonna have
to marry that girl

42:45.362 --> 42:46.964
and we'll have
to be servants forever.

42:47.031 --> 42:48.299
I don't wanna do that.

42:48.365 --> 42:51.235
Yeah, me neither.
I'm saving myself for Kelsey.

Give me some room.

This is for you, Kelsey!

43:09.954 --> 43:12.723
Ryan, are you okay?

43:12.790 --> 43:15.225
It's possible I have several
hundred splinters.

It's not that fancy.

Anyone feel like bowling?

43:40.517 --> 43:41.919
This plane has a bowling alley?

43:41.986 --> 43:44.588
Just a few lanes on the
other side of the pool.

43:44.655 --> 43:46.023
Well, is there a restaurant
in this joint?

43:46.090 --> 43:47.591
I'm starving.

43:47.658 --> 43:49.927
I'll have one of the flight
attendants bring us a snack.

May I help you?

43:53.797 --> 43:55.065
Yes, please.

43:55.132 --> 43:56.700
Can I have four chocolate
milkshakes and a fruit cocktail?

43:56.767 --> 43:57.568
Of course.

43:57.634 --> 43:58.569
And whatever my friends want.

43:58.635 --> 43:59.770
I'll have the same.

That sounds good.

What are you doing?

44:10.047 --> 44:12.750
Going home.

I thought about what you said
about my mom taking off my socks

44:15.986 --> 44:19.790
and you're right.
I'd really miss that.

44:19.857 --> 44:22.359
Yeah.

44:22.426 --> 44:24.361
Hey, you know what
Mr. Madigan needs?

44:24.428 --> 44:25.529
What?

44:25.596 --> 44:27.364
A safety lecture.

44:27.431 --> 44:28.966
Ryan, can I get a beat?

44:29.033 --> 44:30.034
What'd she say?

44:30.100 --> 44:31.235
I believe she needs a beat.
