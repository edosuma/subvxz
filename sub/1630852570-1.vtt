WEBVTT

01:38.766 --> 01:40.433
- Hello?
- Hello

01:41.000 --> 01:42.300
Is Cristina there?

01:42.400 --> 01:44.433
No, she's not available
May I take a message?

01:46.300 --> 01:50.200
Sorry, I'm a friend of hers from group...
Oh, shit

01:50.300 --> 01:51.633
From her shit?

01:51.700 --> 01:56.866
Look, just tell her I'm from group
I'm Charlie She's got my number

01:56.966 --> 01:58.633
She goes to your group?

01:58.700 --> 01:59.766
I shouldn't have...

02:00.833 --> 02:02.900
Just tell her that Charlie called

02:03.533 --> 02:05.500
I will do exactly that, Charlie,

02:05.566 --> 02:07.509
once you tell me
what kind of group we're talking about

02:07.533 --> 02:09.800
Is it AA? NA?

02:09.866 --> 02:12.433
You sound exactly like she describes you

02:12.500 --> 02:14.533
She talks about me in group?

02:14.633 --> 02:17.133
I don't think
I can really talk about that

02:17.200 --> 02:18.300
What does she say about me?

02:19.433 --> 02:21.033
She loves you very much

02:21.133 --> 02:22.733
What does she love about me?

02:26.333 --> 02:28.566
She loves that you're creative

02:28.666 --> 02:30.833
You love art and TV and movies

02:31.566 --> 02:33.333
Lots of people love movies

02:33.400 --> 02:36.533
Yeah, but she says you love scary movies

02:36.600 --> 02:38.866
and that you guys have that in common

02:38.933 --> 02:41.166
She's proud of making a fan out of you

02:41.866 --> 02:43.500
- She is?
- Yeah

02:44.000 --> 02:46.366
She told me the other day, she wonders...

02:47.333 --> 02:49.700
what's your favorite scary movie?

02:50.366 --> 02:53.533
The Babadook It's an amazing meditation
on motherhood and grief

02:55.400 --> 02:58.700
Isn't that a little fancy pants?

02:58.766 --> 03:00.766
Well, it's elevated horror

03:00.866 --> 03:04.500
Uh-huh
What does that mean, "Elevated horror"?

03:04.566 --> 03:08.400
It's scary but with complex emotional
and thematic underpinnings

03:08.500 --> 03:12.966
It's not just some schlocky, cheeseball
nonsense with wall-to-wall jump scares

03:13.733 --> 03:15.900
Sounds kind of boring to me

03:15.966 --> 03:18.166
Have you ever seen Stab?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.300
Once, I think

03:21.900 --> 03:23.933
At a sleepover when I was, like, 12

03:25.233 --> 03:29.100
You live in Woodsboro
and you don't know Stab?

03:29.200 --> 03:33.000
Your mother loves that movie
She talks about it all the time in group

03:33.100 --> 03:35.200
How well do you remember the original?

03:35.666 --> 03:38.933
I don't know
I mean, it was super '90s

03:39.600 --> 03:42.533
It was really over-lit
and everyone had weird hair

03:44.866 --> 03:46.633
Do you remember the beginning?

03:47.333 --> 03:48.766
Not really

03:48.866 --> 03:51.509
It started with a kill scene, right?
They always started with a kill scene

03:51.533 --> 03:54.300
Yeah, that's right That's right

03:54.400 --> 03:56.900
It's a girl at home, alone

03:56.966 --> 04:00.566
She answers a wrong number
and starts talking with the killer

04:00.633 --> 04:02.633
who makes her play a game

04:03.966 --> 04:06.366
Would you like to play a game...

04:07.166 --> 04:08.300
Tara?

04:23.300 --> 04:24.933
Systems armed

05:33.866 --> 05:35.633
This isn't fucking funny, Amber

05:36.100 --> 05:39.366
I told you, this isn't Amber

05:44.133 --> 05:47.400
Amber's looking
particularly fetching tonight

05:47.466 --> 05:52.066
She really shouldn't leave her phone
lying around for anyone to clone

05:53.033 --> 05:54.200
What do you want?

05:54.266 --> 05:57.233
I told you, I want to play a game

05:57.800 --> 05:59.700
Stab movie trivia, three rounds

05:59.766 --> 06:03.366
You call the cops, she dies
You get a question wrong, she dies

06:03.433 --> 06:07.333
Her parents aren't home
I can be in that room in 15 seconds

06:08.000 --> 06:10.466
You want a warmup question?

06:10.566 --> 06:13.433
I told you I don't know these movies!

06:13.533 --> 06:15.400
Ask me about something I do know

06:15.466 --> 06:18.300
Ask me about It Follows
Ask me about Hereditary

06:18.400 --> 06:19.700
Ask me about The Witch

06:19.766 --> 06:21.900
In the first Stab movie,

06:21.966 --> 06:26.400
what Woodsboro native was introduced
as the franchise's main character?

06:27.566 --> 06:29.266
It's Sidney Prescott!

06:29.366 --> 06:31.433
It's Sidney Prescott and she lived on Elm

06:31.500 --> 06:34.266
Correct
You see, you're gonna do great at this

06:34.366 --> 06:36.600
Okay, question one...

06:36.700 --> 06:39.166
No, I got that one right It should count

06:39.266 --> 06:43.300
Anyone could have gotten that one right
Sidney's in every movie but the last one

06:43.400 --> 06:44.833
Question one:

06:44.933 --> 06:49.400
Who wrote the original book
that the Stab movies are based on?

06:55.100 --> 06:56.933
The chick from TV!

06:57.000 --> 07:00.266
"The chick from TV"
is not gonna cut it, Tara

07:01.733 --> 07:03.066
Gale Weathers!

07:03.633 --> 07:05.866
It is Gale Weathers, you motherfucker!

07:05.966 --> 07:09.466
Correct
Amber might live to see the sunrise

07:09.533 --> 07:13.666
Question two: Who played the dumb bitch
at the beginning of Stab 1

07:13.766 --> 07:17.633
who answers the phone
and gets carved up by the killer?

07:17.733 --> 07:18.866
Fuck you

07:18.966 --> 07:21.300
Is that the answer you're going with?

07:24.866 --> 07:27.666
A non-answer
counts as a wrong answer, Tara

07:27.766 --> 07:29.300
Time's running out

07:29.366 --> 07:35.033
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock...

07:36.133 --> 07:37.200
Heather Graham!

07:38.966 --> 07:41.133
Correct! You pulled that one out

07:41.200 --> 07:43.300
Now for the final question:

07:44.100 --> 07:47.500
Who was the killer in Stab 1?

07:50.366 --> 07:51.966
I know this one, you fuck

07:52.800 --> 07:54.333
It's Billy Loomis!

07:54.433 --> 07:57.566
He was Sidney's boyfriend,
and he was played by Luke Wilson,

07:57.666 --> 07:59.200
and I got you, asshole!

08:00.666 --> 08:03.666
I got it! I got it right!

08:04.366 --> 08:08.500
Oh, I'm sorry, Tara,
but that's just not correct

08:09.266 --> 08:10.266
What?

08:10.800 --> 08:13.466
No, no, it is It is That is right

08:13.533 --> 08:17.800
The correct answer is Billy Loomis
and Stu Macher

08:17.866 --> 08:20.600
There are two killers
in the original Stab

08:20.700 --> 08:23.700
I'm afraid someone's got to die now

08:24.266 --> 08:26.233
No, no, no Amber, I'm coming

08:29.300 --> 08:30.766
Fuck, fuck, fuck

08:49.266 --> 08:50.433
Systems armed

08:57.300 --> 08:59.900
The police are on their way, asshole!

09:09.766 --> 09:11.233
All systems disarmed

09:14.600 --> 09:15.733
Systems armed

09:18.966 --> 09:21.200
-All systems disarmed
-Oh, my God No

09:21.266 --> 09:22.866
Systems armed

09:22.933 --> 09:26.200
All systems disarmed Systems armed

09:26.266 --> 09:27.866
All systems disarmed

09:29.300 --> 09:30.533
Systems armed

10:02.633 --> 10:03.766
Hello?

10:03.900 --> 10:06.500
Bonus question, Tara

10:07.900 --> 10:09.300
Please stop

10:09.366 --> 10:13.733
Do you think I made it inside your house
before you could rearm?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.300
Help!

11:42.933 --> 11:44.200
Excuse me, miss?

11:44.266 --> 11:46.400
- What'd you just take?
- Your boner pills

11:47.133 --> 11:48.833
Good luck getting it up now

11:49.700 --> 11:50.766
You...

11:52.033 --> 11:53.366
You are my boner pills

11:55.833 --> 11:57.166
No No

12:07.933 --> 12:09.266
You okay?

12:09.366 --> 12:10.366
Yes

12:10.933 --> 12:13.733
You don't have to check on me
all the time I'm not breakable

12:14.366 --> 12:15.600
Yeah, this I know

12:20.366 --> 12:21.400
Shit

12:27.866 --> 12:30.966
- Sam?
- Hey What's going on?

12:33.100 --> 12:35.833
Tara... was attacked

12:37.400 --> 12:38.866
What? Is she...

12:38.966 --> 12:41.533
She's alive, but in bad shape

12:42.733 --> 12:43.733
She was...

12:44.266 --> 12:45.333
stabbed

12:46.166 --> 12:47.966
Stabbed? What the fuck?

12:48.066 --> 12:50.426
She made it through surgery
and the doctor said it went well

12:50.500 --> 12:52.466
She's resting now

12:52.533 --> 12:54.409
I know you guys
aren't on the best terms, but...

12:54.433 --> 12:55.766
I'm on my way

12:56.366 --> 12:58.966
She's gonna be okay, Sam
We'll see you soon

12:59.033 --> 13:00.533
Hey, wait, Wes!

13:00.633 --> 13:01.633
Yeah?

13:03.100 --> 13:04.633
Do they know who did this?

13:05.466 --> 13:07.633
It's probably better
if you just come here

13:08.233 --> 13:09.366
Wes

13:10.033 --> 13:12.833
She said it was someone
in a fucking Ghostface mask

13:20.800 --> 13:22.433
My sister was attacked

13:24.100 --> 13:25.200
I gotta go

13:25.300 --> 13:28.100
Wait, hey! I'm going with you

13:28.166 --> 13:29.400
No, Richie...

13:29.500 --> 13:32.033
No, Sam I'm coming with you

13:33.000 --> 13:34.533
-Okay
-Okay Yeah

13:37.933 --> 13:42.600
Attention, Panthers A reminder
that all classes and school activities

13:42.700 --> 13:45.400
are canceled tomorrow
due to public safety concerns

13:45.500 --> 13:46.533
That was Sam

13:46.600 --> 13:49.033
- She's coming?
- Yeah

13:50.200 --> 13:51.866
Watch everything get worse

13:51.933 --> 13:54.700
Listen, all I'm saying is,
with everything going on right now,

13:54.800 --> 13:59.066
I think it's time we take our relationship
to the next, most intimate level

13:59.166 --> 14:02.166
He wants me to accept
his Find My Fam request

14:02.233 --> 14:05.166
It's the smartest option
with a would-be killer on the loose

14:05.233 --> 14:07.633
You know exactly where I am
and I know exactly where you are

14:07.733 --> 14:09.242
Aw, you can stalk me
like a jealous boyfriend

14:09.266 --> 14:11.633
And you can stalk me
like a jealous boyfriend

14:12.400 --> 14:14.400
Is this because you two
aren't having sex yet?

14:14.500 --> 14:17.366
You actually bring up a very good point
Not that I want to sound

14:17.433 --> 14:20.100
like a stereotypical jock
trying to get into his girlfriend's pants

14:20.200 --> 14:21.200
Great!

14:21.266 --> 14:23.266
Don't do it, Liv
There's a psycho out there

14:23.366 --> 14:24.576
You make yourself harder to find

14:24.600 --> 14:27.300
Delete social media,
tape over your phone camera, disable GPS

14:27.400 --> 14:29.400
Yes, thank you very much, Edward Snowden

14:29.500 --> 14:32.433
Actually, your mother just interrogated me
about Tara's attempted murder,

14:32.533 --> 14:34.100
which was very fun

14:35.266 --> 14:37.800
I'm sure she's asking everybody
I mean, Ghostface is back

14:37.900 --> 14:39.420
The press still isn't saying Ghostface

14:39.466 --> 14:40.906
My mom doesn't want to cause a panic

14:40.933 --> 14:42.733
It'll get out by the second
or third killing

14:42.800 --> 14:46.733
Jesus, Mindy, there wasn't
a first killing Tara's alive

14:46.800 --> 14:48.733
That means she could still die

14:48.800 --> 14:51.000
- What the fuck?
- Or the killer could come back for her

14:51.100 --> 14:52.233
Fuck! Mindy, come on

14:52.300 --> 14:56.233
I'm just telling you, arm up, okay?
Pepper spray, check Taser, check

14:56.300 --> 14:57.566
Girlfriend repellent, check

14:58.866 --> 15:00.333
Nice Thank you

15:00.433 --> 15:03.633
Oh, shit Is that... Vince?

15:04.733 --> 15:07.133
Wait
The creep you hooked up with last summer?

15:07.733 --> 15:10.266
Yeah, he worked with me and Tara

15:10.333 --> 15:11.333
He worked with Tara?

15:11.366 --> 15:14.133
He's been stalking my Instagram
the last couple weeks,

15:14.233 --> 15:16.600
posting the creepiest shit

15:17.333 --> 15:19.566
Probably time to introduce him
to Hobbs and Shaw

15:19.633 --> 15:23.300
Maybe not the best idea to incite
violence right in front of the sheriff

15:23.933 --> 15:25.566
Looks like he's leaving

15:25.633 --> 15:27.633
Thanks anyway, boys

15:30.333 --> 15:33.500
Tara says she fought back hard
You've got bruises

15:33.600 --> 15:34.966
From football practice

15:35.033 --> 15:36.033
Oh, sure

15:36.133 --> 15:37.366
Tara's awake She just texted

15:38.366 --> 15:40.166
I'm going to the hospital
You guys coming?

15:40.266 --> 15:41.633
-Yeah
-Yeah

15:42.966 --> 15:44.833
I can't, but I'll meet you guys later

15:44.933 --> 15:46.300
All right

15:55.866 --> 15:57.333
I've actually never seen Stab

15:57.400 --> 15:59.000
You've never seen Stab?

16:00.066 --> 16:02.000
Not even the one that came out last year?

16:02.066 --> 16:04.066
I've never seen Gone With the Wind either,

16:04.166 --> 16:07.700
but I don't consider it like a huge hole
in my cinematic education

16:07.800 --> 16:11.133
Most of the Stab movies
are based on things that happened here

16:12.066 --> 16:13.200
Define "things"

16:13.700 --> 16:14.700
Things like...

16:14.800 --> 16:19.100
a guy named Billy Loomis and his friend
carved up a bunch of high-school kids

16:19.166 --> 16:21.766
while wearing this Halloween ghost mask

16:21.866 --> 16:23.400
You mean like in Halloween?

16:24.700 --> 16:26.566
No Not like in Halloween

16:28.566 --> 16:32.033
-Sounds a lot like Halloween
-All right, it's a little like Halloween

16:32.100 --> 16:36.066
And every decade or so,
some idiot gets the bright idea

16:36.166 --> 16:39.000
to put on the mask, kill his friends,
and get famous, too

16:39.066 --> 16:41.300
The last time it happened was in 2011

16:41.366 --> 16:42.966
And we came here voluntarily?

16:43.433 --> 16:45.433
Well, I got to make sure Tara's okay

16:46.100 --> 16:47.400
Yes, of course

16:47.500 --> 16:50.200
And I got to make sure
we don't get sliced up by some lunatic

16:50.266 --> 16:52.600
who saw Friday the 13th and thought,
"You know what?

16:52.700 --> 16:55.700
That Jason guy,
he's got some pretty solid ideas"

16:56.866 --> 16:58.666
Can I just ask you one question, though?

16:59.266 --> 17:00.266
Yeah

17:00.400 --> 17:02.066
Do you have any idea why

17:02.133 --> 17:05.266
someone wearing that mask
would want to kill your sister?

17:06.333 --> 17:07.333
No

17:28.266 --> 17:29.400
How are you feeling?

17:30.566 --> 17:31.566
You came

17:32.133 --> 17:33.133
Of course I came

17:34.433 --> 17:35.833
This is my boyfriend, Richie

17:35.933 --> 17:38.366
It's so nice to meet you
I'm so sorry if I'm intruding

17:38.933 --> 17:40.300
Nice to meet you, too

17:41.733 --> 17:42.933
Hi

17:43.033 --> 17:44.033
Hi

17:44.933 --> 17:46.600
-Thank you for calling
-Of course

17:48.166 --> 17:50.900
Look at your hair! I like it

17:51.466 --> 17:54.433
These are Chad and Mindy,
the twins And Wes

17:54.500 --> 17:55.766
I used to babysit them all

17:55.833 --> 17:58.000
Which is always how
I like to be introduced

18:00.133 --> 18:01.400
And Amber Hey

18:02.133 --> 18:04.333
Hi Nice to see you

18:04.433 --> 18:07.533
-Hi I'm Richie
-Hi

18:07.633 --> 18:10.166
- Where's Mom?
- She's stuck at a conference in London

18:10.266 --> 18:11.466
She called me earlier

18:11.533 --> 18:13.466
Yeah, for all of ten minutes

18:15.200 --> 18:18.666
Look, guys, Tara's really tired
Maybe we should just give her some space

18:18.766 --> 18:20.066
-Yeah
-Yeah

18:23.300 --> 18:24.866
Not you, Sam

18:26.300 --> 18:27.400
I want you to stay

18:28.100 --> 18:29.133
Okay

18:29.700 --> 18:31.233
-But the rest
-Yeah

18:32.766 --> 18:36.133
If it's okay with you,
I could sleep here tonight

18:37.366 --> 18:38.500
I'd really like that

18:38.566 --> 18:39.866
Okay

18:39.966 --> 18:42.433
- Do you have your extra inhaler?
- Yeah, I'll be fine

18:42.500 --> 18:43.500
Okay

18:46.666 --> 18:48.466
Honey? Okay, I'll just be right outside

18:48.533 --> 18:49.633
Thank you

18:49.700 --> 18:50.700
Bye

19:00.133 --> 19:02.200
Sam, I was so scared

19:02.266 --> 19:03.266
I know

19:04.400 --> 19:05.533
It's okay

19:10.400 --> 19:12.800
So what is she like, the sister?

19:12.866 --> 19:14.733
Sam? Sam is so cool

19:14.833 --> 19:18.266
You only say that because she let you
wear Pokemon onesies to bed for a year

19:18.366 --> 19:20.366
That's true That's a true statement

19:20.466 --> 19:23.033
No, trust me, Sam is not cool

19:23.133 --> 19:27.500
Her dad left her mom Walks right out
when Tara's eight, Sam's 13

19:27.566 --> 19:30.200
Sam started acting out,
getting in trouble with the cops

19:30.266 --> 19:33.533
And then, on Sam's 18th birthday,
she leaves

19:34.066 --> 19:35.533
Ghosts them all

19:35.600 --> 19:39.400
Maybe Sam's changed
I just don't want to see Tara hurt again

19:39.500 --> 19:42.366
So what, you're protecting Tara
from her own sister now?

19:42.900 --> 19:44.400
Well, someone has to

19:44.500 --> 19:48.433
Okay, so no guys are good enough for her
and now her family's off-limits, too?

19:48.533 --> 19:50.366
Mm, motive

19:50.433 --> 19:52.166
"If I can't have her, no one can"

19:52.233 --> 19:54.866
- What?
- We all know you have a crush on Tara

19:54.933 --> 19:56.400
Okay Come on, Mindy

19:56.500 --> 19:58.366
But we're all suspects

20:02.600 --> 20:03.700
Except maybe Liv

20:03.766 --> 20:05.966
-Thank you
-You're way too boring to be a psycho

20:06.066 --> 20:08.666
Yo, Liv You want a real drink?

20:09.300 --> 20:11.433
Or are you happy sitting
at this kids' table?

20:11.533 --> 20:15.466
Listen up, Uglier Michael Myers,
it was a summer fling It meant nothing

20:15.566 --> 20:17.709
- Was I talking to you?
- I don't care who you're talking to

20:17.733 --> 20:19.266
-Liv, let's go
-Don't talk to her!

20:19.333 --> 20:21.176
-I don't want to hear your voice
-Shut your mouth

20:21.200 --> 20:22.466
Better shut the fuck up

20:22.566 --> 20:24.433

Just a bad dream

22:16.433 --> 22:17.666
What are you watching?

22:19.033 --> 22:20.533
Stab is on Netflix

22:22.600 --> 22:24.700
What? I want to be prepared

22:25.600 --> 22:27.566
I got to go find something to eat

22:27.666 --> 22:28.666
Yeah, okay

22:52.266 --> 22:53.466
How you doing, Sam?

22:57.800 --> 23:00.900
Antipsychotics aren't working
as well as they used to, are they?

23:01.400 --> 23:02.600
Fuck you

23:03.633 --> 23:05.900
You can't run from who you are, Sam

23:06.466 --> 23:07.833
I'm just trying to help

23:08.833 --> 23:13.033
Hey, when are you gonna tell her
why all this is happening?

23:27.933 --> 23:29.266
Hello

23:29.333 --> 23:31.466
Hello, Samantha

23:34.466 --> 23:35.466
Who is this?

23:35.533 --> 23:39.333
Someone who knows
your little family secret

23:41.133 --> 23:42.800
You're the fuck who hurt my sister?

23:43.400 --> 23:45.266
She's not the only one I'm gonna hurt

23:45.333 --> 23:50.066
I had to get you
to come back here somehow, didn't I?

23:50.733 --> 23:52.733
You want to fuck with me, asshole?

23:53.200 --> 23:55.166
I'm right here Come and get me

23:55.666 --> 23:57.066
With pleasure

24:12.233 --> 24:13.433
Help!

24:21.766 --> 24:23.333
Help! Help!

24:24.300 --> 24:26.766
Somebody help me, he's trying to kill me!

24:27.466 --> 24:29.566
What's going on? You're okay

24:29.666 --> 24:31.633
Somebody tried to kill me
in the break room!

24:43.266 --> 24:47.000
I've got a body outside a bar on Main,
and then you get attacked here

24:47.066 --> 24:48.900
You said the call came
from Amber's number?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.866
So? We know he called on my phone
before when he attacked Tara

24:51.933 --> 24:56.500
Or, and I'm just spit-balling here...
you're the killer

24:57.200 --> 24:58.809
And where were you when all this happened?

24:58.833 --> 25:01.733
I was... watching Netflix

25:01.833 --> 25:05.233
-Ooh, yeah Super-solid alibi, bro
-So where were you?

25:05.333 --> 25:07.809
I was questioning Amber and her friends
at the sheriff's station

25:07.833 --> 25:09.433
Yeah, I came as soon as I heard

25:09.533 --> 25:11.142
But, you know,
the Netflix alibi is good, too

25:11.166 --> 25:12.166
Both of you, stop it

25:12.233 --> 25:14.166
You're gonna put more cops
on her room, right?

25:14.233 --> 25:15.233
Yes

25:15.866 --> 25:17.633
And I can move you to a private floor

25:17.733 --> 25:19.833
Deputy Vinson knows what he's doing,
you'll be safe

25:19.900 --> 25:21.166
Like we've been so far?

25:22.933 --> 25:24.700
Samantha, let's step outside

25:28.966 --> 25:30.933
Nice to see you, Deputy Hicks

25:31.600 --> 25:34.200
-So many fun memories
-It's "Sheriff" Hicks

25:34.266 --> 25:36.033
I remember you, too...

25:36.600 --> 25:39.233
and all the trouble
you used to cause your family

25:39.833 --> 25:41.933
Your presence here is not helping

25:42.033 --> 25:43.666
So maybe when the sun comes up,

25:43.766 --> 25:45.333
you and your boyfriend can hit the road

25:45.433 --> 25:48.400
and leave it to people
who actually care about this community

26:01.866 --> 26:03.433
Well, she remains a delight

26:03.533 --> 26:04.533
Are you okay?

26:05.633 --> 26:08.133
Would you mind giving us a second?
I need to talk to Tara

26:08.766 --> 26:10.066
Come on, Netflix, let's go

26:27.600 --> 26:29.433
Do you remember when Dad left?

26:30.633 --> 26:32.033
Parts, sure

26:34.333 --> 26:36.700
I was eight
What does that have to do with anything?

26:36.800 --> 26:37.933
It has to do with it

26:42.300 --> 26:43.700
Do you remember how...

26:44.433 --> 26:46.600
Mom used to keep those boxes
up in the attic?

26:48.033 --> 26:49.733
Well, I was up there once...

26:49.833 --> 26:52.633
When I was 13,
looking for Christmas presents

26:53.666 --> 26:57.366
And I found these old diaries
that she kept from high school

26:57.466 --> 26:58.933
- Sam, what is...
- Please

26:59.000 --> 27:00.533
I have to do this

27:01.166 --> 27:03.000
So I found these old diaries

27:03.600 --> 27:06.533
And I knew it was wrong,
but I read some anyway

27:06.633 --> 27:08.933
because Mom got pregnant
with me in high school,

27:09.000 --> 27:12.266
and I thought it could be cool to find out
how she and Dad got together

27:12.333 --> 27:13.833
How romantic it must have been

27:15.300 --> 27:16.400
So I read some

27:18.066 --> 27:19.800
Only it wasn't romantic

27:21.866 --> 27:23.766
Mom was dating Dad, but...

27:24.566 --> 27:27.366
she was in love with this other guy...

27:28.000 --> 27:29.533
and he got her pregnant

27:30.500 --> 27:33.066
She told Dad it was his,
and that's why he proposed senior year

27:33.166 --> 27:34.446
Sam, what are you talking about?

27:34.533 --> 27:36.533
And I'm sitting there, in this attic...

27:37.233 --> 27:38.733
and I'm 13...

27:39.300 --> 27:42.533
and I just found out my dad isn't my dad

27:44.533 --> 27:48.300
So I go find Mom in her bedroom,
and I'm screaming at her

27:49.100 --> 27:51.533
and shoving this diary in her face,

27:51.633 --> 27:53.500
and I didn't even realize...

27:54.033 --> 27:56.133
that Dad was standing right behind me

27:58.233 --> 27:59.700
He didn't know

28:02.733 --> 28:04.666
He found out right then from me

28:08.533 --> 28:10.066
He left that night

28:11.133 --> 28:12.866
I'm the reason he left

28:12.933 --> 28:14.000
No

28:14.066 --> 28:15.066
No, Sam...

28:15.133 --> 28:16.933
Mom never forgave me

28:17.033 --> 28:20.466
Then she made me promise never
to tell you because you were so young

28:22.133 --> 28:24.200
And that's why I changed

28:24.266 --> 28:28.566
and I got distant and weird with you

28:30.700 --> 28:35.600
And I went out and I started doing
every drug that I could get my hands on

28:36.100 --> 28:38.566
until I couldn't take it anymore
and I left town

28:39.233 --> 28:42.066
I just couldn't be
around you anymore, Tara

28:42.133 --> 28:45.633
Not only because I destroyed our family
that night, but because...

28:46.366 --> 28:49.233
those diaries told me
who my real father was

28:53.133 --> 28:54.566
It was Billy Loomis

28:55.766 --> 28:58.800
And somebody knows,
and I think that's why you got hurt

28:58.900 --> 29:02.600
And I'm so fucking sorry
that I never told you and then I ran away

29:02.666 --> 29:03.966
-I'm so sorry
-Get out

29:04.066 --> 29:05.533
Tara

29:05.633 --> 29:07.300
You're gone for five years...

29:08.300 --> 29:09.733
Five whole years

29:09.800 --> 29:11.576
And then I get stabbed
and you want to come back

29:11.600 --> 29:13.100
and drop all this shit on me?

29:13.166 --> 29:14.600
I thought I was protecting you

29:14.666 --> 29:16.166
Protecting me from what?

29:18.666 --> 29:19.666
The truth?

29:20.466 --> 29:24.533
-No No, I... Please, Tara
-Sam

29:24.633 --> 29:27.600
-Sam, I need you to get the fuck out
-I'm so sorry

29:27.666 --> 29:28.966
-Sam
-Please

29:29.066 --> 29:30.800
Get the fuck out!

29:50.233 --> 29:52.666
Hey, hey, hey It's okay, it's me

29:54.633 --> 29:56.233
Were you listening at the door?

29:57.100 --> 29:58.500
No, no, of course not

29:59.766 --> 30:02.133
Okay, yeah, I was listening at the door

30:02.700 --> 30:04.166
It doesn't freak you out...

30:05.233 --> 30:07.466
that my real father was a serial killer?

30:08.033 --> 30:09.133
I mean...

30:09.800 --> 30:10.866
yeah

30:11.566 --> 30:13.133
A great deal, yeah

30:13.166 --> 30:15.866
Okay, well, then go I get it

30:17.333 --> 30:19.333
I just got to stay and figure it out

30:19.400 --> 30:20.833
I'm not leaving you here, Sam

30:22.066 --> 30:23.800
You know that part in horror movies

30:23.866 --> 30:27.533
where you want to yell at the characters
to be smart and get the fuck out?

30:28.533 --> 30:30.600
This is that part, Richie

30:31.166 --> 30:32.833
You should get the fuck out

30:37.533 --> 30:38.800
But I'm staying

30:41.800 --> 30:43.166
I love you

30:48.033 --> 30:51.066
-You're such a dumbass
-I'm such a dumbass

30:52.300 --> 30:53.700
So...

30:53.766 --> 30:55.300
your sister won't talk to you

30:56.633 --> 30:58.266
The police aren't gonna help

30:58.766 --> 31:00.066
What's our next move?

31:02.766 --> 31:04.566
We go talk to an expert

31:07.533 --> 31:10.733
...a few temperatures here
Tuesday, Wednesday in the mid-50s,

31:10.833 --> 31:14.200
and then finally we'll see
those mid-60s returning into next week

31:14.266 --> 31:17.300
And just one night after a local teen
was attacked in her home

31:17.400 --> 31:19.566
by an assailant in a Ghostface costume,

31:19.633 --> 31:21.466
Sheriff Judy Hicks has now confirmed

31:21.566 --> 31:24.600
two more late-night attacks
that have left Woodsboro reeling

31:24.666 --> 31:27.333
The first victim, Vincent Schneider,
was found dead

31:27.433 --> 31:29.000
behind the Corner Pocket Pool Hall

31:29.100 --> 31:31.433
A second victim, as yet unnamed,
was attacked

31:31.533 --> 31:33.266
inside Woodsboro General Hospital,

31:33.333 --> 31:35.266
but she escaped without injuries

31:35.333 --> 31:38.133
Needless to say,
Woodsboro is on high alert today...

31:38.233 --> 31:41.333
Live from Studio 1-A in Rockefeller Plaza...

31:41.433 --> 31:43.300
Good morning I'm Gale Weathers

31:44.066 --> 31:46.600
Before we dive in,
I want to tell you a little story

31:46.666 --> 31:49.200
that happened on the way
to the studio this morning

31:49.300 --> 31:52.266
I stopped to get a bacon,
egg and cheese at a bodega,

31:52.333 --> 31:54.000
already a quintessentially New York...

31:54.100 --> 31:55.700
Go away!

31:55.800 --> 31:57.500
Sorry to bother you, Mr Riley!

31:58.100 --> 32:00.166
We just want to ask you a few questions

32:01.033 --> 32:03.233
I don't give interviews

32:03.300 --> 32:05.133
We're not looking for an interview

32:06.466 --> 32:08.666
Give me one good reason
why I should talk to you

32:08.766 --> 32:10.700
I'm Billy Loomis's daughter

32:12.466 --> 32:14.833
That's a terrible reason
for me to talk to you

32:15.466 --> 32:16.966
My name is Samantha Carpenter

32:17.566 --> 32:19.800
I was attacked last night at the hospital

32:19.900 --> 32:23.133
The night before that,
my sister was stabbed seven times

32:23.200 --> 32:24.666
I know you know what that's like

32:25.866 --> 32:27.733
I'm just trying to protect my family

32:29.000 --> 32:31.733
Five minutes That's all I'm asking

32:33.666 --> 32:35.500
I'll give you two minutes

32:35.600 --> 32:37.066
I'm missing a show I like

32:37.166 --> 32:39.466
If I ever threaten to get bangs,
stage an intervention

32:39.533 --> 32:40.733
Gale Weathers

32:40.833 --> 32:43.666
-Weren't you two...
-Yeah

32:52.800 --> 32:53.800
Who's he?

32:54.400 --> 32:56.200
This is Richie, my boyfriend

32:56.300 --> 32:57.420
How long have you known him?

32:58.166 --> 32:59.166
Six months?

32:59.233 --> 33:01.433
Did he know who your dad was when you met?

33:02.366 --> 33:06.233
Express any interest in Woodsboro
or the Ghostface killings?

33:06.333 --> 33:08.033
What the hell are you talking about?

33:08.100 --> 33:10.966
Your killer's obsessed
with the Stab movies, right?

33:11.033 --> 33:15.400
Well, there are certain rules
to surviving a Stab movie

33:16.533 --> 33:17.833
Believe me, I know

33:18.966 --> 33:20.166
Rule number one:

33:20.966 --> 33:23.033
Never trust the love interest

33:23.100 --> 33:24.966
They seem sweet, caring, supportive

33:25.033 --> 33:28.300
Then welcome to act 3,
where they're trying to rip your head off

33:28.366 --> 33:30.600
I was with Sam in Modesto
when Tara was attacked

33:30.700 --> 33:32.866
And let me guess,
you were just in the other room,

33:32.933 --> 33:36.133
conveniently unaccounted for
when she was attacked at the hospital

33:36.233 --> 33:39.533
Do I have to take this from
shitty Sam Elliott over here, or what?

33:40.100 --> 33:41.566
Rule number two:

33:41.666 --> 33:46.200
The killer's motive is
always connected to something in the past

33:47.400 --> 33:48.733
I'm related to Billy

33:48.800 --> 33:51.533
Right, but then why kill
that random Vince guy?

33:51.600 --> 33:53.333
That's for you to figure out

33:53.900 --> 33:56.700
And rule number three,
and this is the most important rule:

33:57.400 --> 34:01.700
The first victim always has a friend group
that the killer is a part of

34:02.566 --> 34:05.066
Does your sister have
a close-knit group of friends?

34:05.700 --> 34:06.700
Yeah

34:07.833 --> 34:08.900
She does

34:09.433 --> 34:11.033
Then look for the killer there

34:11.966 --> 34:13.933
If you can find out
why they're doing this,

34:14.033 --> 34:15.433
you can figure out who's next

34:16.500 --> 34:17.733
So help us

34:18.733 --> 34:20.800
Help us figure out who is behind this

34:20.900 --> 34:23.600
You kidding me?
I've been stabbed nine times

34:23.699 --> 34:26.100
I've got permanent nerve damage
and a fun little limp

34:26.166 --> 34:27.833
You think I want to do that again?

34:28.366 --> 34:31.833
You just said it always goes
back to the past, right?

34:33.600 --> 34:35.900
So if I'm in danger...

34:36.866 --> 34:38.533
that means you're in danger

34:39.733 --> 34:40.733
Come on

34:41.433 --> 34:43.632
Let's do this together

34:46.766 --> 34:47.866
Your time's up

34:48.466 --> 34:49.733
Jesus!

34:51.400 --> 34:53.132
Yeah, he's way more fun in the movies

34:56.733 --> 34:58.533
Okay, what's next?

34:58.633 --> 34:59.633
The friends

35:01.466 --> 35:03.100
Thanks so much for that, Kevin

35:03.166 --> 35:04.766
Coming up after our local weather,

35:04.800 --> 35:07.666
the pros and cons
of reuniting with old friends

35:36.133 --> 35:37.333
Hello?

35:37.433 --> 35:38.566
Hey, Sid, it's me

35:40.133 --> 35:41.200
Dewey?

35:42.166 --> 35:44.533
Oh, my God How long has it been?

35:44.600 --> 35:47.160
I'm just trying to get a run in
before I take the girls to school

35:47.200 --> 35:48.200
How are you?

35:48.266 --> 35:50.200
I'm good, really good

35:50.266 --> 35:51.833
How are you? How's Mark?

35:51.900 --> 35:53.066
I think I'll keep him

35:53.666 --> 35:55.500
How are things in the sheriff's business?

35:55.566 --> 35:57.233
They're...

35:57.800 --> 36:00.733
- They're fine But, Sid...
- Have you talked to Gale lately?

36:02.466 --> 36:04.400
No Not in a couple years

36:05.066 --> 36:07.366
I know things didn't end well
with you guys, but...

36:07.466 --> 36:09.000
Sid...

36:09.066 --> 36:10.366
it's happening again

36:14.600 --> 36:16.033
What are you talking about?

36:16.133 --> 36:18.400
Some idiot in a Ghostface mask

36:18.966 --> 36:21.600
Three attacks so far One dead

36:21.700 --> 36:24.266
Something about this one
just feels different

36:26.566 --> 36:27.733
Are you okay?

36:28.266 --> 36:30.033
I'm fine, you know me

36:30.100 --> 36:31.300
Yeah

36:31.933 --> 36:33.566
I do That's why I'm asking

36:34.400 --> 36:35.533
I'm fine

36:36.066 --> 36:37.100
I just...

36:37.600 --> 36:39.766
want you to be safe up there
Do you have a gun?

36:40.600 --> 36:43.233
I'm Sidney fucking Prescott
Of course I have a gun

36:45.433 --> 36:46.733
Good That's good

36:47.833 --> 36:48.833
Does Gale know?

36:48.900 --> 36:50.633
No, she's my next call

36:51.333 --> 36:52.800
But, Sid, promise me:

36:52.900 --> 36:57.200
No matter what you hear or what you see
on the news, don't come here

36:57.266 --> 37:00.400
No offense, Dewey I have no intention
of ever setting foot in that town again

37:01.133 --> 37:02.133
Good

37:03.433 --> 37:04.533
Dewey...

37:05.133 --> 37:08.266
whoever this killer's after,
I'm glad they have you to protect them

37:12.066 --> 37:13.666
You be safe, okay?

37:14.766 --> 37:15.766
Will do

37:16.433 --> 37:17.933
It's good to hear your voice

37:19.066 --> 37:20.100
You, too, Sid

37:23.800 --> 37:26.266
Come on Get it together, Dewey

37:48.133 --> 37:50.966
Probably shouldn't have sent
the smiley face

38:33.400 --> 38:35.000
Holy shit He came

38:38.300 --> 38:42.000
I've decided to temporarily assist you
in your investigation

38:42.066 --> 38:43.300
Thank you

38:45.966 --> 38:49.066
Look, just because that guy showered
doesn't mean he should have a gun

38:56.400 --> 38:58.200
How do you know so much about Stab?

38:58.300 --> 38:59.700
Runs in her family

39:00.233 --> 39:01.700
Randy was our uncle

39:01.766 --> 39:03.000
RIP

39:05.233 --> 39:07.200
You said to bring everybody

39:10.800 --> 39:13.000
Woo, suspects!

39:13.866 --> 39:16.000
My brother would be so proud

39:17.000 --> 39:18.200
Hey, Martha

39:18.733 --> 39:21.100
Dewey! Hi!

39:21.200 --> 39:22.566
You look...

39:25.266 --> 39:26.566
Yeah

39:26.666 --> 39:29.266
- How's the wife?
- Okay, Mom, we're good Thank you

39:29.366 --> 39:31.800
All right, kids, have fun

39:35.233 --> 39:37.733
I asked Mindy to call everybody here,
because...

39:40.100 --> 39:41.966
there's something I have to tell you

39:43.366 --> 39:44.600
So let me get this straight

39:44.700 --> 39:47.300
You're saying that you're
the daughter of Billy Loomis,

39:47.400 --> 39:49.600
and, what, that one of us is the killer?

39:50.166 --> 39:52.100
The killer told me he knew my secret

39:53.033 --> 39:54.966
He attacked Tara to lure me back here

39:55.066 --> 39:59.566
But then why immediately go and murder
some douche-nozzle that was stalking Liv?

39:59.633 --> 40:01.366
And why does it have to be one of us?

40:01.433 --> 40:04.266
What about Deputy Dewey here?
Maybe he's the killer

40:04.900 --> 40:05.900
No offense

40:05.966 --> 40:08.266
None taken, but what's my motive?

40:08.366 --> 40:10.466
You got stabbed a billion times,

40:10.533 --> 40:13.466
got dumped by your famous wife
and crawled into a bottle

40:13.533 --> 40:15.733
I think it's safe to say
you're on the suspect list

40:15.800 --> 40:17.466
Well, maybe you're the killer

40:18.666 --> 40:20.300
Because that cut deep

40:20.966 --> 40:22.866
That douche-nozzle is connected

40:23.766 --> 40:25.800
I googled him His mom is Leslie Macher

40:26.500 --> 40:28.933
-Stu Macher's sister
-Who's Stu Macher?

40:29.000 --> 40:31.200
He's Billy Loomis's accomplice

40:31.300 --> 40:32.866
A real loony tune

40:32.966 --> 40:34.300
Okay Okay

40:35.166 --> 40:39.300
So the first three attacks are all
on people related to the original killers

40:39.400 --> 40:41.200
Oh, my God He's making a requel!

40:42.100 --> 40:43.100
A what?

40:43.200 --> 40:45.466
Or a legacyquel
Fans are torn on the terminology

40:45.533 --> 40:47.133
God Please speak English

40:47.200 --> 40:49.009
Remember the Stab movie
that came out last year?

40:49.033 --> 40:51.666
Oh, yeah! The one
the Knives Out guy directed, right?

40:51.766 --> 40:53.433
I actually really liked that one

40:53.500 --> 40:55.133
Of course you did
You have terrible taste

40:55.200 --> 40:56.433
I hate you

40:56.500 --> 40:59.433
The point is,
the hard-core Stab fans hated it

40:59.500 --> 41:00.833
You go on 4chan and Dreadit,

41:00.900 --> 41:03.500
all they're talking about is
how Stab 8 pissed on their childhoods

41:03.533 --> 41:05.800
How they crammed in social commentary
just to elevate it

41:05.866 --> 41:07.633
How the main character's a Mary Sue

41:07.700 --> 41:09.740
- What's a Mary Sue?
- You really don't want to know

41:09.800 --> 41:11.333
What's wrong with elevated horror?

41:11.833 --> 41:13.800
I mean, Jordan Peele fucking rules

41:13.866 --> 41:16.166
Obviously, but that's not Stab

41:16.800 --> 41:20.866
Real Stab movies are
meta slasher whodunits, full stop

41:20.933 --> 41:23.533
-Come on, it's just a movie
-No, it's not

41:23.600 --> 41:26.800
To some people, the original
is their favorite thing in the world

41:26.866 --> 41:29.366
The movie that made them love horror

41:29.466 --> 41:32.800
That Mom or Dad showed them when
they were ten that bonded them together

41:32.866 --> 41:36.066
And God help anyone who
slightly fucks with that special memory

41:36.166 --> 41:37.846
Who makes a movie
they think disrespects it

41:38.600 --> 41:42.700
It sounds like our killer is writing
his own version of Stab 8,

41:42.800 --> 41:44.700
but doing it as a requel

41:45.366 --> 41:46.366
Which is?

41:47.400 --> 41:50.166
See, you can't just reboot a franchise
from scratch anymore

41:50.233 --> 41:51.566
The fans won't stand for it

41:51.633 --> 41:54.266
Black Christmas, Child's Play, Flatliners...

41:54.366 --> 41:55.733
that shit doesn't work

41:55.833 --> 41:58.500
But you can't just do
a straight sequel, either

41:58.566 --> 41:59.966
You got to build something new

42:00.066 --> 42:02.833
But not too new,
or the Internet goes bug-fucking nuts

42:02.900 --> 42:05.100
It has to be part
of an ongoing story line,

42:05.200 --> 42:08.100
even if the story shouldn't have been
ongoing in the first place

42:08.200 --> 42:09.933
New main characters, yes,

42:10.033 --> 42:13.600
but supported by
and related to legacy characters

42:13.700 --> 42:15.833
Not quite a reboot, not quite a sequel

42:15.900 --> 42:19.500
Like the new Halloween, Saw,
Terminator, Jurassic Park, Ghostbusters...

42:19.566 --> 42:20.900
fuck, even Star Wars!

42:20.966 --> 42:25.066
It always,
always goes back to the original!

42:25.133 --> 42:29.433
Are you telling me that I'm caught
in the middle of fan-fucking-fiction?

42:30.200 --> 42:33.100
Not just in the middle, Sam

42:33.633 --> 42:35.200
You're the star

42:37.466 --> 42:40.600
So, not to put too fine a point on it,

42:40.666 --> 42:44.100
but, according to requel rules...

42:45.900 --> 42:46.900
who's next?

42:47.533 --> 42:48.866
Going by the pattern,

42:49.533 --> 42:52.600
whoever it is has to be connected
to someone that came before

42:57.166 --> 42:59.466
I'm starting to regret coming here

42:59.566 --> 43:01.242
Jesus, my mom was
a character in one of them

43:01.266 --> 43:04.800
No one cares about the shitty
inferior sequels, Wes You're safe

43:04.900 --> 43:07.433
With Randy as our uncle, though,
you and I are probably screwed

43:07.500 --> 43:08.700
Wait What?

43:08.800 --> 43:09.800
Or you're the killer,

43:09.900 --> 43:13.266
and this whole elaborate monologue
is just to cover your tracks

43:13.966 --> 43:16.833
I think it's pretty clear
who the killer is at this point

43:16.933 --> 43:17.933
Who?

43:18.900 --> 43:20.166
You

43:21.466 --> 43:23.433
It makes perfect requel sense

43:23.500 --> 43:25.500
-That actually does make a lot of sense
-Yeah

43:30.500 --> 43:31.600
Fuck this

43:33.166 --> 43:35.733
-Meet you back at the motel
-Sam, wait

43:35.833 --> 43:36.933
Sam, wait

43:38.800 --> 43:41.500
The first fucking rule of these movies
is don't split up!

43:46.400 --> 43:48.333
The nerve of that girl, right?

43:50.300 --> 43:52.833
I'm really not in the mood right now

43:52.933 --> 43:54.133
Sam, Sam, Sam

43:54.200 --> 43:56.333
There is a killer on the loose

43:56.400 --> 43:58.500
He's threatening you
He's threatening your sister

43:58.600 --> 44:01.133
Are you gonna run away
from who you are like you always do,

44:01.200 --> 44:02.700
or are you gonna use it?

44:02.800 --> 44:04.100
I'm not like you

44:04.200 --> 44:05.366
Really?

44:05.433 --> 44:07.033
And how else are you gonna survive?

44:07.166 --> 44:08.500
I say accept who you are,

44:08.566 --> 44:10.900
let's get out there,
find out who's doing this,

44:11.400 --> 44:13.400
and cut some fucking throats!

44:13.500 --> 44:14.866
No!

44:22.200 --> 44:24.833
And extra edamame Please

44:26.100 --> 44:28.400
Thank you I'll be there in ten minutes

44:30.000 --> 44:31.033
Bye

44:38.466 --> 44:39.866
That you, tiger?

45:18.233 --> 45:19.633
Jesus!

45:23.166 --> 45:24.800
Are you being safe out there, honey?

45:25.433 --> 45:28.033
To the point
that all my friends mock me, yes

45:28.100 --> 45:29.133
Good boy

45:29.733 --> 45:32.766
- What's for dinner?
- Sushi I was just leaving to pick it up

45:33.300 --> 45:34.766
Why don't you just Postmates it?

45:35.366 --> 45:37.800
It gets all smooshy
by the time it's here

45:37.900 --> 45:39.166
I know you hate that

45:39.933 --> 45:41.800
Go take a shower I'll be back soon

45:41.900 --> 45:43.933
- Can you put this away for me?
- Yes

45:47.800 --> 45:49.066
-Love you
-Love you

45:49.133 --> 45:50.633
-Lock the door
-I will

46:29.000 --> 46:32.333
-Sheriff Hicks

- I think you know

46:35.666 --> 46:39.433
I'm a fan of scary movies And knives

46:39.500 --> 46:42.300
What's your favorite scary movie?

46:43.100 --> 46:45.200
I prefer animated films and musicals

46:45.833 --> 46:47.300
Why are you doing this?

46:47.366 --> 46:51.233
I'll tell you all about it
I'm calling to turn myself in

46:51.733 --> 46:53.200
I think that's a great idea

46:53.266 --> 46:57.833
We'll sit down at the station, and I'll
tell you about the two people I've killed

46:57.900 --> 46:59.533
You've only killed one person

47:00.233 --> 47:04.600
By the time I see you,
I'll have gutted your baby boy

47:09.266 --> 47:10.600
Fuck you!

47:15.500 --> 47:16.800
Pick up, Wes!

47:28.366 --> 47:31.566
This is Sheriff Hicks
I need units to converge on my house ASAP

47:31.633 --> 47:32.900
Copy that We're on it

47:35.066 --> 47:37.033
Can't get him on the phone, can you?

47:37.100 --> 47:38.733
He must be busy

47:38.833 --> 47:40.900
How do I know you're anywhere near him?

47:40.966 --> 47:43.166
Ever seen the movie Psycho?

47:55.400 --> 47:56.400
Please...

47:57.666 --> 47:59.000
don't hurt my boy

47:59.100 --> 48:00.400
Why not?

48:01.200 --> 48:03.433
-He's a good kid
-Is he, now?

48:03.533 --> 48:04.866
He never hurt anyone

48:05.333 --> 48:07.133
That's not enough

48:07.233 --> 48:09.633
Please! I'll do anything!

48:09.733 --> 48:12.966
You're not gonna make it in time,
Sheriff Judy

48:31.566 --> 48:32.566
Wes!

48:33.133 --> 48:34.166
I'm coming!

48:35.133 --> 48:36.366
Wes!

48:44.300 --> 48:45.633
Help!

48:47.900 --> 48:49.300
Help!

50:19.866 --> 50:20.866
Okay

51:20.733 --> 51:21.733
Mom?

51:45.500 --> 51:46.633
Mom?

52:32.233 --> 52:34.666
Fuck... you!

53:20.633 --> 53:23.400
Miss, you can't be here
You can't be here

53:23.500 --> 53:24.966
No, I'm sorry I know her son

53:25.066 --> 53:27.300
-Her son, Wes Is he...
-I'm sorry

53:35.233 --> 53:36.400
I'm sorry

53:48.133 --> 53:49.200
Excuse me

53:52.333 --> 53:53.333
Oh, my God

53:53.966 --> 53:54.966
You're...

53:55.733 --> 53:57.633
Well, you're you

53:57.733 --> 53:59.233
Last time I checked

54:00.466 --> 54:03.266
Are you okay? You seem like
you're having a bit of a moment

54:03.333 --> 54:04.566
Did you know the sheriff?

54:05.666 --> 54:06.666
Sort of

54:07.766 --> 54:09.333
She didn't like me very much

54:10.133 --> 54:11.366
She didn't like me either

54:12.633 --> 54:14.933
I'm Samantha Sam Carpenter

54:15.500 --> 54:16.933
My sister and I were attacked

54:18.300 --> 54:19.633
Sorry to hear that

54:20.266 --> 54:21.266
I'm Gale...

54:26.433 --> 54:27.466
Riley

54:27.966 --> 54:30.433
Weathers I'm Gale Weathers Excuse me

54:33.933 --> 54:35.033
- Gale?
- A text?

54:35.666 --> 54:37.466
You tell me the killer is back in a text?

54:37.533 --> 54:39.500
-Ow, that hurts
-Good!

54:40.066 --> 54:42.000
-You were on the air
-How do you know?

54:43.200 --> 54:44.333
A hunch

54:44.966 --> 54:47.200
You look good Are you still writing?

54:48.633 --> 54:49.633
No time

54:50.133 --> 54:52.166
You were always happiest
when you were writing

54:52.266 --> 54:54.266
Well, sir, it's okay
We're here with Gale

54:54.333 --> 54:56.733
I'd give you a hand,
but I can't release anybody right now

54:57.466 --> 54:59.200
Couldn't resist a good story, could you?

54:59.300 --> 55:02.533
Don't be an idiot, Dewey
I'm here because I was worried about you

55:03.166 --> 55:07.200
Okay, yes My producers wanted me
to cover this, for obvious reasons,

55:07.866 --> 55:09.600
but 90% is because of you

55:10.533 --> 55:12.633
Well, I feel 90% better

55:12.700 --> 55:14.333
Don't be so sensitive

55:14.400 --> 55:17.733
Since when did you care about my feelings?
Especially not in the last couple years

55:17.833 --> 55:20.833
All right, listen Let's not pretend
I'm the one who ended things

55:21.400 --> 55:24.666
No one's pretending, Gale
I remember what happened

55:27.100 --> 55:28.300
Why aren't you in uniform?

55:29.633 --> 55:30.766
I retired

55:30.866 --> 55:32.300
Since when?

55:33.633 --> 55:34.966
Since they asked me to

55:36.400 --> 55:37.400
Dewey

55:37.500 --> 55:39.166
I don't need your pity, Gale

55:40.400 --> 55:42.066
I made my choices So did you

55:42.766 --> 55:45.533
It was my turn
It was a great opportunity

55:46.066 --> 55:47.900
-You said you'd try
-And I did

55:48.000 --> 55:49.200
For two whole months!

55:49.266 --> 55:53.133
Listen, if you want to make me feel worse
than I already do, good luck

55:53.233 --> 55:55.866
The mornings aren't so bad,
because I get to see you

55:56.400 --> 55:58.800
Pretend I'm still back there in New York

56:00.000 --> 56:01.233
But then I remember...

56:03.200 --> 56:06.400
that I couldn't hack it
I left in the middle of the night...

56:07.600 --> 56:08.733
like a coward

56:09.700 --> 56:11.433
Why wouldn't you tell me that then?

56:12.200 --> 56:13.600
It would have mattered

56:15.366 --> 56:17.566
You are a lot of things, Dewey...

56:19.566 --> 56:21.366
but you are not a coward

56:22.100 --> 56:23.100
You just...

56:23.166 --> 56:25.300
You just were meant to be in Woodsboro

56:26.500 --> 56:27.500
And you weren't?

56:30.366 --> 56:32.600
Promise me you'll leave
as soon as you can

56:32.700 --> 56:34.233
You know I can't promise that

56:39.100 --> 56:40.633
I'm sorry about Judy

56:41.733 --> 56:42.900
Yeah, me too

56:45.066 --> 56:47.166
But she'll make a great chapter
in your next book

56:49.900 --> 56:54.466
And don't even get me started
on Ghostface's signature new weapon

56:54.533 --> 56:56.066
That shit is lit

56:56.133 --> 57:00.166
And can we talk about the title? Stab?
What, just like the original?

57:00.266 --> 57:04.333
Just call it Stab 8 It's fucking Stab 8
You're not fooling anyone

57:04.433 --> 57:05.733
It's such bullshit

57:05.800 --> 57:08.533
- Where have you been? Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine

57:08.633 --> 57:11.766
You know, that Mindy girl wasn't kidding
Stab 8 is not like the others

57:11.833 --> 57:15.466
I mean, no connection to the other movies
No legacy characters at all

57:16.166 --> 57:18.733
This franchise goes off the rails
with number five

57:18.800 --> 57:24.200
Richie, listen to me He killed
two more people Wes and his mother

57:24.300 --> 57:26.966
He killed the sheriff? You can do that?

57:27.033 --> 57:29.300
I mean, are you okay? Where are you?

57:29.866 --> 57:31.833
-I'll call you right back
-No, Sam...

57:31.900 --> 57:33.366
We should be out looking for him

57:33.466 --> 57:34.833
Who's at the hospital?

57:36.466 --> 57:38.100
Who's watching my sister?

57:38.766 --> 57:40.033
I just heard about the sheriff

57:41.766 --> 57:43.000
They needed me here!

57:43.633 --> 57:45.866
- Where are you going?
- My sister's in trouble!

57:47.700 --> 57:49.966
...where Judy Hicks
has just been brutally murdered

57:56.333 --> 57:57.800
What are you waiting for?

57:57.866 --> 57:59.200
Drive!

58:00.033 --> 58:01.266
Come on Let's go!

58:11.866 --> 58:12.866
Hello?

58:19.066 --> 58:20.133
Hello?

58:29.000 --> 58:30.066
Fuck this

58:41.700 --> 58:42.700
Fuck!

59:34.400 --> 59:35.466
Goddamn it!

59:36.066 --> 59:37.900
Should you be making
a phone call right now?

59:38.666 --> 59:39.666
Please, please

01:00:07.166 --> 01:00:08.300
Stop!

01:00:09.033 --> 01:00:11.600
You know we have to live
through this to help her, right?

01:00:11.666 --> 01:00:12.666
Just hold on

01:00:59.166 --> 01:01:00.300
Holy shit

01:01:15.666 --> 01:01:17.000
Goddamn it!

01:01:17.066 --> 01:01:18.100
Richie?

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.466
What are you doing here?

01:01:20.133 --> 01:01:21.700
Sam called She said that...

01:01:21.766 --> 01:01:23.366
you were in trouble

01:01:23.433 --> 01:01:25.433
- Did you hit me with the phone?
- Look out!

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.100
Richie!

01:02:08.166 --> 01:02:10.733
- Are you at the hospital?
- Hello, Samantha

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.800
No

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:14.300
Richie can't come to the phone right now

01:02:15.033 --> 01:02:16.800
He's finding out what happens to people

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:20.133
who stick their noses in business
that doesn't concern them

01:02:20.233 --> 01:02:23.166
-Please don't hurt him
-I'll tell you what You can choose

01:02:23.266 --> 01:02:25.066
I'll only kill one

01:02:25.133 --> 01:02:27.500
What? Tara!

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.500
Who do you want to hear die?

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.500
No, please I'm begging you
Please don't hurt them

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.433
Really? You can't save your own sister?

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.866
All you have to do is say, "Kill Richie"

01:02:36.966 --> 01:02:37.966
No! No!

01:02:38.933 --> 01:02:40.866
No! Tara! Don't touch her

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:43.133
Please, please, please, I'm begging you

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.866
Or say, "Kill Tara,"

01:02:44.966 --> 01:02:48.333
and I'll make sure to hit
all the organs I missed last time

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.200
Fuck you!

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.933
I'm begging you Please don't hurt her

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.933
Last chance to save one

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.133
Choose

01:02:56.933 --> 01:02:58.533
Why are you doing this?

01:02:58.633 --> 01:03:00.300
You want to know why, Sam?

01:03:00.366 --> 01:03:02.333
Maybe it's because you're a selfish bitch

01:03:02.433 --> 01:03:06.300
who can't even make a decision
to save the life of someone you love

01:03:07.166 --> 01:03:10.000
Maybe you're too weak for this franchise

01:03:11.633 --> 01:03:12.800
Maybe you're right

01:03:14.366 --> 01:03:17.166
Or maybe I'm just stalling for time,
fuckhead

01:03:22.366 --> 01:03:23.533
I'll get Richie

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:24.633
Tara!

01:03:28.833 --> 01:03:30.300
Come on, Richie

01:03:31.133 --> 01:03:32.800
It's okay I got you

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.233
It's gonna be all right

01:03:38.266 --> 01:03:39.533
Get the elevator!

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.800
Not today

01:04:18.533 --> 01:04:19.533
Richie

01:04:20.433 --> 01:04:21.566
Let's get out of here

01:04:28.433 --> 01:04:29.600
Come on, hurry up

01:04:32.633 --> 01:04:34.500
-The head
-What?

01:04:34.566 --> 01:04:37.033
You have to shoot 'em in the head,
or they always come back

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.133
Dewey! Who gives a fuck?

01:04:40.233 --> 01:04:42.233
-I do
-No! Dewey!

01:05:21.333 --> 01:05:23.500
Yes, today

01:05:45.333 --> 01:05:47.133
It's an honor

01:06:32.966 --> 01:06:34.000
No!

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:35.700
No!

01:07:15.866 --> 01:07:16.866
I'm sorry

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.666
I didn't know him well, but...

01:07:23.233 --> 01:07:24.233
he helped me

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.300
That's what he did

01:07:28.466 --> 01:07:29.766
He helped people

01:07:31.466 --> 01:07:32.833
I should've stopped him

01:07:34.566 --> 01:07:36.600
If you had, my sister would be dead

01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:42.300
Samantha, your sister's awake

01:08:00.133 --> 01:08:01.166
Gale

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.800
Sidney

01:08:06.066 --> 01:08:07.333
I came as soon as I heard

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:11.933
I'm so sorry

01:08:22.633 --> 01:08:24.166
You shouldn't be here

01:08:24.265 --> 01:08:25.733
You shouldn't be here either

01:08:27.966 --> 01:08:30.265
- Mark and the kids are okay?
- Yeah, they're safe for now

01:08:31.433 --> 01:08:32.966
I'm here to make sure of that

01:08:34.899 --> 01:08:36.100
Come here

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
How you feeling?

01:08:51.566 --> 01:08:54.433
Every time I get attacked,
they give me better painkillers

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:56.966
So there's that

01:08:59.466 --> 01:09:00.832
I'm sorry

01:09:00.899 --> 01:09:02.800
For what? You saved my life

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.233
For not telling you sooner

01:09:09.899 --> 01:09:11.733
For being the reason Dad left

01:09:11.832 --> 01:09:13.800
You're not the reason Dad left

01:09:14.566 --> 01:09:17.533
You didn't choose where you came from
Or who you came from

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.000
I don't blame you for that

01:09:21.066 --> 01:09:23.000
I blame you for leaving me too

01:09:23.566 --> 01:09:25.466
That's never gonna happen again

01:09:27.332 --> 01:09:28.366
I know

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:32.466
But why didn't you come to me back then?

01:09:32.533 --> 01:09:34.033
I could've helped

01:09:34.666 --> 01:09:35.666
Because...

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.533
I was scared

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:41.600
Of what?

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.166
I was scared
that I would turn out just like him

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:49.100
So I ran

01:09:50.533 --> 01:09:51.700
To protect you

01:09:52.866 --> 01:09:55.566
-From me
-Sam...

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.733
you could never be like him

01:10:05.766 --> 01:10:08.100
-You're so high right now
-I'm so high right now

01:10:08.733 --> 01:10:10.100
I'm not even gonna lie

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.933
I love you

01:10:17.566 --> 01:10:18.600
I love you too

01:10:22.533 --> 01:10:23.666
So what do we do now?

01:10:24.733 --> 01:10:27.800
What nobody ever does in these situations

01:10:29.733 --> 01:10:32.000
We're gonna get the fuck out of Woodsboro

01:10:38.933 --> 01:10:40.333
- That's her?
- Yeah

01:10:44.066 --> 01:10:45.233
Samantha?

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:48.600
It's Sam

01:10:48.666 --> 01:10:50.233
- I'm...
- I know who you are

01:10:52.433 --> 01:10:53.700
I hope you're okay

01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:57.166
- Listen, I'm sorry...
- You're Billy's daughter

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.833
We'll bring the car around

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.633
Yeah I'm his daughter

01:11:07.366 --> 01:11:09.100
I'm sorry if that's weird for you

01:11:09.166 --> 01:11:10.800
No, no, it's...

01:11:12.333 --> 01:11:15.100
I've been through this A lot

01:11:16.233 --> 01:11:17.300
You want to talk?

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.700
I appreciate it

01:11:20.866 --> 01:11:22.000
And I'm...

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.633
I'm really sorry about Dewey

01:11:25.533 --> 01:11:27.533
But I'm taking my sister away
from all this

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:34.466
I tried running too
It doesn't work, it always follows

01:11:34.533 --> 01:11:36.633
All due respect,
that's your life, not mine

01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:39.133
-I'm not so sure about that
-What do you want from me, lady?

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.633
Hey! Watch your tone, new girl

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:44.533
You know how they always say
it goes back to the original?

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:46.066
Here's the original

01:11:46.166 --> 01:11:47.666
I want your help

01:11:47.733 --> 01:11:49.376
Because you're wrong,
this is your life now

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:52.000
Which means whoever this is
will keep coming for you

01:11:52.066 --> 01:11:54.400
- So?
- So I want you to help us kill him

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:59.633
You want me to help you and the host
of a morning show commit murder?

01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:00.766
-Correct
-Yeah

01:12:00.866 --> 01:12:02.866
And I'm what in this scenario?

01:12:03.533 --> 01:12:06.100
The bait? The helpless victim?

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.533
-If the shoe fits...
-You're not helpless, Sam

01:12:09.166 --> 01:12:11.000
He killed your friend, he killed ours

01:12:11.066 --> 01:12:14.066
And I have kids, which means
I won't sleep until he's in the ground

01:12:16.033 --> 01:12:18.766
Look, I'm sorry about
what this has done to your lives

01:12:18.866 --> 01:12:22.200
But no matter what you
or the killer or anyone says,

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.000
this isn't my story

01:12:24.666 --> 01:12:27.066
All right!
Let's get the fuck out of town, huh?

01:12:28.333 --> 01:12:30.100
Sorry That's my boyfriend, Richie

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.900
Nice to meet... We met

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.733
Sam, please get in the car so we never
have to see these people again

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:37.266
- Sam...
- No We're leaving

01:12:38.133 --> 01:12:40.100
That's the only way I can protect Tara

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:43.466
Okay, good luck

01:12:46.666 --> 01:12:47.733
You too

01:12:52.766 --> 01:12:54.266
Well, that went fucking horribly

01:12:54.366 --> 01:12:56.933
Don't worry, I have a plan
She seems really tough

01:12:57.033 --> 01:12:59.033
Honestly, Sid, who gives a shit?

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:01.460
You said it yourself,
he's gonna go after her

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:02.900
I put a tracker on her car

01:13:02.966 --> 01:13:03.966
You did what?

01:13:04.066 --> 01:13:06.166
It seemed like something
Gale Weathers would do

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:08.600
Take that as a compliment

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:13.033
I left a message for Mom
I told her where we're going

01:13:14.433 --> 01:13:15.766
You good back there?

01:13:17.033 --> 01:13:18.400
Fuck, where is it?

01:13:18.466 --> 01:13:19.466
Where's what?

01:13:19.966 --> 01:13:22.066
My inhaler I usually keep an extra one

01:13:23.166 --> 01:13:24.166
Should we go back?

01:13:24.266 --> 01:13:27.800
Whoa Okay I vote for not going back
to the murder hospital

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:30.233
- You want to stop at a pharmacy?
- I'd need a prescription

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:33.133
But I left an extra one at Amber's
Her house is on the way

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.533
No... no

01:13:35.633 --> 01:13:37.000
I'd be in and out

01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:38.433
Could you hold out till Modesto?

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.866
-I don't think so
-Okay, what's the address?

01:13:40.966 --> 01:13:42.633
123 No Fucking Way Lane

01:13:42.733 --> 01:13:44.633
Richie, she needs it

01:13:44.733 --> 01:13:47.933
And I need to keep all the blood
inside my body So do you

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Richie, please

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:51.166
It's okay

01:13:53.133 --> 01:13:56.100
Okay, yeah Fuck
What's the goddamn address?

01:14:01.933 --> 01:14:03.466
Hey, thanks for coming

01:14:16.033 --> 01:14:18.133
Keep pouring, Wheeler Thank you

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:19.766
Hey

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:21.500
To Wes!

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.666
Beautiful son of a bitch

01:14:24.766 --> 01:14:25.800
We love you, buddy!

01:14:25.866 --> 01:14:28.633
Shots, really?
This is supposed to be a memorial

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:30.366
Well, this is how I mourn

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:34.633
and distract myself
from the looming specter of Death

01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:36.000
Hey, we're low on beer

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:38.700
There's more in the basement
I'll go get some

01:15:18.433 --> 01:15:21.366
What the fuck, Mindy? Jesus!

01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:23.533
That was a test And you failed

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.933
Never go off on your own
with a masked killer around

01:15:26.033 --> 01:15:28.033
You're the one that said
we needed more beer

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:30.033
And you should have asked me
to come with you

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:35.433
You know what else you shouldn't do
when there's a masked killer around?

01:15:35.533 --> 01:15:36.533
What?

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:41.533
Follow someone into a dark,
creepy basement alone

01:15:43.233 --> 01:15:44.233
I mean...

01:15:46.133 --> 01:15:47.633
how do you know I'm not the killer?

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:52.566
Because I am

01:15:56.466 --> 01:15:57.966
I'm not, actually

01:15:58.066 --> 01:16:02.000
But let that be a lesson
Don't trust anyone

01:16:03.433 --> 01:16:06.000
Then how can I trust you
when you say you're not the killer?

01:16:06.133 --> 01:16:07.233
Exactly

01:16:08.433 --> 01:16:09.433
You're learning

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.433
Now let's go back upstairs

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
You first

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:22.500
Very good

01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:36.666
I think I'm ready

01:16:38.133 --> 01:16:39.433
I mean, I think we should

01:16:40.233 --> 01:16:42.766
Like now You want to go upstairs?

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:45.000
Like... Like upstairs?

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.600
Uh-huh Right now

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:56.366
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I think I have to pass on that

01:16:57.333 --> 01:16:58.533
What?

01:17:00.133 --> 01:17:01.466
Why?

01:17:03.033 --> 01:17:08.800
You know, I'm not like
entirely sure that you're not the...

01:17:09.966 --> 01:17:11.333
killer

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:13.300
"Don't take this the wrong way"?

01:17:13.366 --> 01:17:18.033
No, no, look I'm almost 100% certain
that you are not, but...

01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:21.466
the safest option is to be down here

01:17:21.533 --> 01:17:22.633
with all the people...

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.166
Fuck you

01:17:24.266 --> 01:17:25.666
...and the potential witnesses

01:17:25.733 --> 01:17:28.166
That is a completely valid
emotional response to have

01:17:29.033 --> 01:17:30.866
-That too
-Fucking asshole

01:17:32.633 --> 01:17:33.633
Good job

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:36.533
Fuck you, Mindy

01:17:38.233 --> 01:17:40.566
If I hadn't have written that book
about your mother,

01:17:40.666 --> 01:17:42.866
-none of this would've happened
-Gale

01:17:42.966 --> 01:17:45.766
-I started all of this
-No, you didn't

01:17:46.333 --> 01:17:48.966
Billy Loomis started this,
and we're gonna end it

01:17:49.833 --> 01:17:54.300
After tonight, no more books,
no more movies, no more fucking Ghostface

01:17:54.866 --> 01:17:57.500
- Don't you know the rules?
- What rules?

01:18:01.433 --> 01:18:07.366
There are specific rules
to successfully survive a horror movie

01:18:07.433 --> 01:18:10.766
For instance, Number One:
You can never have sex

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:14.100
-Don't do it Don't go outside after her
-She's not texting me back

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.366
Because she's probably dead

01:18:15.433 --> 01:18:18.333
Jesus, Mindy
That's my girlfriend, and I love her

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.933
Was your girlfriend

01:18:20.033 --> 01:18:22.873
You're just gonna sit and watch a movie
about our uncle getting stabbed?

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:23.933
It calms me down, okay?

01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:27.600
I'm also gonna smoke some weed
and possibly hook up with Frances

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:30.133
Have fun

01:18:30.666 --> 01:18:32.966
Oh, my God,
at least take some sort of weapon

01:18:33.633 --> 01:18:34.733
Here you go

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:49.833
All right

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:56.400
What?

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.533
Liv?

01:19:25.933 --> 01:19:27.133
Liv?

01:19:51.033 --> 01:19:53.366
All right Okay, yeah, no

01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:55.700
Shit!

01:20:07.666 --> 01:20:08.766
Fuck!

01:20:31.933 --> 01:20:33.566
Please, please, please

01:21:07.366 --> 01:21:09.200
Whoa! Stop! Wait!

01:21:22.566 --> 01:21:25.066
Perfect She's having a party

01:21:25.866 --> 01:21:28.866
Who has a party in the middle
of a killing spree? I'm aborting the plan

01:21:28.933 --> 01:21:32.666
No, we're already here I'll go in quickly
and get it I'll be back in five

01:21:32.766 --> 01:21:33.666
I'm coming too

01:21:33.766 --> 01:21:36.333
If you think I'm waiting out here
just to get murdered,

01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:37.900
you're out of your mind

01:21:48.333 --> 01:21:49.466
Tara!

01:21:51.233 --> 01:21:54.566
What are you doing out of the hospital?
Should you even be up and around?

01:21:54.633 --> 01:21:57.033
-I need my spare inhaler
-Why? Where are you going?

01:22:00.633 --> 01:22:03.266
It's fine, don't tell me
I get it Just be safe, okay?

01:22:05.166 --> 01:22:06.466
I think it's in my room

01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:12.333
All right, everyone!
Thanks for coming, but the party's over!

01:22:13.166 --> 01:22:14.500
- Time to go!
- No!

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.833
But it's so early!

01:22:16.933 --> 01:22:18.100
Let's go

01:22:20.333 --> 01:22:23.566
Hey, hey, hey! Hello!
Can we cut the music, please?

01:22:25.633 --> 01:22:28.366
Hi... Gen Z How are you?

01:22:28.466 --> 01:22:32.466
Both Sam and Tara here have been attacked
by the killer twice

01:22:32.533 --> 01:22:36.200
Now they're here, which makes this place
a huge murder target, so...

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:38.300
if I were you, I would probably leave

01:22:39.066 --> 01:22:41.266
Okay, I tried to be nice
Get the fuck out!

01:22:41.333 --> 01:22:43.133
Please get the fuck out

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.466
-Sincerely, get the fuck out
-Buzzkill!

01:22:45.533 --> 01:22:50.333
Thank you Thank you all
I'm saving your life I promise

01:22:51.033 --> 01:22:52.266
Thanks, teens

01:22:54.466 --> 01:22:55.933
Thank you so much

01:22:56.733 --> 01:22:58.866
Great, thank you for leaving the cup
Thank you

01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:01.200
Saving your life

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.333
I'm saving your life

01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:06.366
Saving your life, thank you

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:09.500
And Number Three:

01:23:09.566 --> 01:23:11.900
Never, ever, ever,
under any circumstances,

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.866
say, "I'll be right back"

01:23:13.966 --> 01:23:15.233
'Cause you won't be back

01:23:16.566 --> 01:23:18.700
Somebody's goofy-ass dad's kicking us out

01:23:18.766 --> 01:23:20.233
Goddamn it

01:23:20.333 --> 01:23:21.433
Thank you

01:23:21.533 --> 01:23:23.100
Thanks, guys, have a good night

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.900
-You have my number Bye
-Bye

01:23:37.366 --> 01:23:38.433
Hi

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:41.533
Is there any beer left?
There's none in the kitchen

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.233
Yes, Richie, there's beer in the basement

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:47.033
Right behind you Basement

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:48.766
Yeah

01:23:48.866 --> 01:23:50.866
Do you want to come with me?

01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:53.800
No But you were right to ask

01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:54.933
Yeah

01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:58.766
Okay, I'll be right back

01:24:02.233 --> 01:24:03.433
Yeah Yeah

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.066
Well, he's dead

01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:09.433
The goddamn fucking Uber canceled on me!

01:24:10.233 --> 01:24:13.766
Great Now I can't have sex
and I can't get a ride home

01:24:14.266 --> 01:24:16.833
Could this night get any shittier?

01:24:16.933 --> 01:24:18.966
Liv, where's my brother?

01:24:19.066 --> 01:24:22.933
What? I don't know, Mindy Probably off
accusing everyone of being the killer!

01:24:23.766 --> 01:24:26.066
He actually went looking for you

01:24:27.733 --> 01:24:29.600
I didn't see him Okay?

01:24:31.033 --> 01:24:32.500
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:24:33.733 --> 01:24:36.366
Just revising my suspect list

01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:40.333
Fuck this!

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.333
Are you afraid of me, Mindy?

01:24:51.433 --> 01:24:54.866
You think I did something
to your brother? Huh?

01:24:55.466 --> 01:24:58.300
You think I'm gonna... cut you up?

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:01.333
A little bit now... yeah

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:05.766
I thought you said
I was too boring to be the killer

01:25:06.333 --> 01:25:09.166
Maybe that's the twist

01:25:10.333 --> 01:25:13.833
What do you think, huh? You're the expert

01:25:15.433 --> 01:25:19.466
You know what eventually happens
to the expert?

01:25:20.366 --> 01:25:21.500
What?

01:25:27.966 --> 01:25:29.533
Enjoy your stupid movie

01:25:32.133 --> 01:25:35.133
Fucking psycho

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.666
They stopped

01:25:36.766 --> 01:25:38.866
- Gas station?
- No

01:25:38.966 --> 01:25:40.966
-Oh, shit
-What?

01:25:44.166 --> 01:25:46.366
Oh, shit How far are we?

01:25:46.466 --> 01:25:47.466
Too far

01:25:48.166 --> 01:25:49.533
Damn it

01:25:49.566 --> 01:25:51.500
Tara, we're leaving!

01:25:57.366 --> 01:25:58.366
Hello

01:25:58.466 --> 01:26:00.366
You need to get out
of that house right now

01:26:00.466 --> 01:26:01.546
How do you know where I am?

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.733
You're in Stu Macher's house,
where your dad and Stu killed everyone

01:26:04.833 --> 01:26:07.866
Someone planned to get you there
You need to get the fuck out, Sam!

01:26:16.166 --> 01:26:18.266
No, Jamie Watch out

01:26:18.933 --> 01:26:20.366
Watch out, Jamie

01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:22.533
You know he's around

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.866
- What?
- There he is

01:26:24.933 --> 01:26:29.433
Come on, man, turn around!
Turn around! Dude!

01:26:29.533 --> 01:26:33.033
I told you I told you,
he's around the corner Jamie

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:36.700
-Look behind you
-No, Randy, look behind you

01:26:36.766 --> 01:26:38.700
Come on, man, turn around!

01:26:38.766 --> 01:26:42.033
Dude, what are you doing? You can do it!

01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:44.533
These are your rules! Own that shit

01:26:45.266 --> 01:26:47.200
Behind you! Turn around

01:26:47.266 --> 01:26:49.266
Look behind...

01:26:50.933 --> 01:26:52.400
Oh, shit!

01:27:11.933 --> 01:27:13.533
That's a lot of blood, Sam

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:16.600
No, Mindy, stay with me

01:27:16.666 --> 01:27:19.133
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing

01:27:19.233 --> 01:27:20.800
No, I didn't do anything

01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:22.966
- The killer, he...
- Is she okay?

01:27:23.566 --> 01:27:24.566
What the fuck?

01:27:24.633 --> 01:27:26.100
Richie, where the fuck were you?

01:27:26.166 --> 01:27:27.666
I went into the basement to get beer

01:27:27.766 --> 01:27:29.006
You went to the basement alone?

01:27:29.033 --> 01:27:31.166
I asked her to come with me! She said no!

01:27:31.266 --> 01:27:32.333
Fuck!

01:27:32.433 --> 01:27:33.666
Stay the fuck back

01:27:33.766 --> 01:27:35.000
Jesus Christ!

01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:37.600
I was with Tara, but the rest of you
were wandering around

01:27:37.666 --> 01:27:39.566
One of you is the fucking killer!

01:27:39.633 --> 01:27:42.000
Fuck you, Amber Fuck you!

01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:44.833
- Why is there blood on your hands?
- What?

01:27:46.833 --> 01:27:50.100
- I found Chad I found Chad and he's...
- Chad?

01:27:50.166 --> 01:27:52.566
-You're fucking lying
-No

01:27:52.633 --> 01:27:54.500
-You're the killer
-No, I'm not

01:27:54.633 --> 01:27:55.833
Liv, stop

01:27:55.933 --> 01:27:58.100
- Fuck you!
- Liv, just stop!

01:27:58.166 --> 01:28:01.700
Fuck you, Amber
I'm not the fucking killer!

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:02.933
I know

01:28:06.333 --> 01:28:07.600
Welcome to Act Three

01:28:07.666 --> 01:28:08.800
Run!

01:28:11.133 --> 01:28:12.300
Holy shit!

01:28:12.366 --> 01:28:13.800
Sam, come on!

01:28:13.866 --> 01:28:16.333
Run! Go, go, go! Go!

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.800
- Oh, my God... Tara!
- Wait, no, Sam

01:28:21.866 --> 01:28:22.866
She has a gun

01:28:22.966 --> 01:28:25.066
There are always two killers

01:28:33.833 --> 01:28:35.333
Sam, please put the knife down

01:28:37.866 --> 01:28:39.166
Look, I think...

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.166
-I think the other killer might be Tara
-What?

01:28:42.233 --> 01:28:45.700
She's the one that brought us here
and you two have been estranged for years

01:28:47.333 --> 01:28:48.400
I mean...

01:28:49.366 --> 01:28:50.866
how well do you really know her?

01:28:51.433 --> 01:28:52.900
Better than I know you

01:28:56.066 --> 01:28:57.833
Sam, wait Sam!

01:29:14.666 --> 01:29:15.733
Sounds about right

01:29:16.666 --> 01:29:17.666
You ready?

01:29:17.733 --> 01:29:19.533
For this? Never

01:29:20.466 --> 01:29:21.566
Here we go

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.400
Help me, help me! He stabbed me!

01:29:31.466 --> 01:29:33.233
- What do you think?
- Trap

01:29:33.733 --> 01:29:34.733
Fuck it

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:35.933
Ow!

01:29:38.933 --> 01:29:40.633
Gale! Gale!

01:29:40.733 --> 01:29:42.100
Wait Let me see

01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:44.833
-You got to go to the hospital
-No

01:29:45.366 --> 01:29:48.100
You said we were gonna finish this
Go finish it, Sidney

01:29:49.133 --> 01:29:50.133
Gale

01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:52.233
For Dewey

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:36.766
Anyone hiding, killer or not,
you have five seconds to show yourself!

01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:11.800
Tara

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:12.966
Oh, my God

01:31:21.866 --> 01:31:22.866
Sam

01:31:23.533 --> 01:31:24.900
Sam, please

01:31:34.466 --> 01:31:37.266
Hello, Sidney!

01:31:37.366 --> 01:31:39.866
Hello there Where'd you go?

01:31:39.933 --> 01:31:43.066
This isn't Amber I'm the other one

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.800
There's two of you Again

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:49.033
I've seen this movie before

01:31:49.133 --> 01:31:51.033
Not this movie, Sidney

01:31:51.133 --> 01:31:53.166
You really need some new material

01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:56.266
I got you here, didn't I?

01:31:57.066 --> 01:31:59.300
You might actually be
the most derivative one of all

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:01.033
I mean, Christ, the same house?

01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:05.400
Maybe so But you forgot the first rule
of surviving a Stab movie

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.166
- Never answer the...
- I'm bored

01:32:07.233 --> 01:32:08.366
Wait!

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:15.266
Put your hands up! Show me your hands!
What are you doing in there?

01:32:16.066 --> 01:32:17.233
Hiding from murderers

01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:18.300
I told you to come out!

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:20.766
I'm not gonna come out!
You're shooting everything!

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:23.833
Holy shit, it's Ghostface!

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:41.800
Richie! Gun Get the gun

01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:44.266
Kind of hard since you shot me in the leg

01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:56.766
- Yes! Yes!
- Shoot him!

01:32:59.666 --> 01:33:01.000
Thank God you're okay

01:33:04.933 --> 01:33:06.266
'Cause I really,

01:33:06.966 --> 01:33:08.633
really wanted to be the one to kill you

01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:15.133
Sit the fuck down, Prescott!

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:39.166
I can't believe this worked

01:33:44.333 --> 01:33:47.066
I know It's a bummer it's me

01:33:51.033 --> 01:33:53.600
But it really was
the best choice for the movie

01:33:55.966 --> 01:33:58.166
This isn't a fucking movie!

01:33:59.266 --> 01:34:01.133
No But it will be

01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:05.400
- That's the point, right, Amber?
- Right, hon!

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:09.200
Third Act bloodbath, check
Killers revealed, check

01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:11.033
Time for the big finale!

01:34:13.966 --> 01:34:15.000
Richie...

01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:19.833
Okay Okay

01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:21.733
Let's get 'em into the kitchen

01:34:22.833 --> 01:34:24.066
Let's go, bitch!

01:34:24.166 --> 01:34:26.500
Someone has to save the franchise

01:34:26.566 --> 01:34:31.166
You see, no one has made
a great Stab movie since the first one

01:34:31.733 --> 01:34:32.900
Not really

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.166
Hey, baby, you want to go get
the very ex-Mrs Riley?

01:34:36.233 --> 01:34:37.366
Yeah, I do

01:34:38.766 --> 01:34:39.866
Hey, hey!

01:34:39.933 --> 01:34:42.333
Whoa... whoa

01:34:43.433 --> 01:34:44.866
Sidney Prescott

01:34:44.933 --> 01:34:46.400
You know...

01:34:47.933 --> 01:34:49.233
I'm a really big fan

01:34:49.333 --> 01:34:50.366
Go fuck yourself

01:34:51.066 --> 01:34:54.100
- You see the last Stab movie?
- Not really a fan of scary movies

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.566
That checks out Anyway, it sucked balls

01:34:56.666 --> 01:35:00.066
Because nobody takes
the true fans seriously Not really

01:35:01.033 --> 01:35:03.033
They just laugh at us, and why?

01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:05.200
Because we love something?

01:35:05.866 --> 01:35:07.400
We're just a fucking joke to them?

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:12.200
How can fandom be toxic?

01:35:12.266 --> 01:35:14.033
It's about love!

01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:17.800
They don't fucking understand
that these movies are important to people

01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:19.400
-Richie...
-But we're gonna help them!

01:35:20.233 --> 01:35:22.966
Hollywood's totally
fucking out of ideas,

01:35:23.066 --> 01:35:26.233
so we decided we'd give them
some new source material to follow

01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:28.133
Bring it back to basics

01:35:28.233 --> 01:35:30.266
Because that's how you make
a great Stab movie, Sam

01:35:31.633 --> 01:35:33.400
"Based on actual events"

01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.233
-Gale
-Sit the fuck down!

01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:39.500
Back up

01:35:44.833 --> 01:35:49.066
You did all this just to make me
the hero of your fucked-up movie?

01:35:49.133 --> 01:35:52.000
Sweetie, you're not the hero

01:35:54.266 --> 01:35:55.466
You're the villain

01:35:56.433 --> 01:36:00.133
The daughter of Billy Loomis who sees
fucked-up visions of her dead dad

01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:02.100
Sidney Prescott killed your father

01:36:02.666 --> 01:36:03.766
You...

01:36:03.833 --> 01:36:07.300
did all this just to get her
back to Woodsboro

01:36:08.666 --> 01:36:11.966
You know what the biggest problem
with the Stab movies is?

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:15.666
There's no Michael Myers
or Jason Voorhees

01:36:15.766 --> 01:36:18.066
No bad guy to keep coming back

01:36:18.633 --> 01:36:21.300
But the illegitimate daughter
of the original mastermind?

01:36:22.666 --> 01:36:24.533
Now that's a fucking villain

01:36:24.633 --> 01:36:27.300
- How did you know?
- About your father?

01:36:28.533 --> 01:36:31.866
It's a small town and your mom's a drunk!

01:36:32.566 --> 01:36:34.533
I met Richie on the Stab subreddit

01:36:35.366 --> 01:36:38.800
I've been obsessed ever since
my parents bought this house

01:36:39.566 --> 01:36:42.166
We realized pretty quickly
we had similar ideas

01:36:42.233 --> 01:36:44.800
Wasn't that hard for me
to find you in Modesto

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.866
It wasn't that hard for me
to fuck you, either

01:36:47.966 --> 01:36:49.542
But I guess
being a sexually available woman

01:36:49.566 --> 01:36:51.133
is supposed to be empowering these days

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:52.200
Fuck you!

01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:54.833
Well, now you're just
quoting the original

01:36:55.833 --> 01:36:57.900
But it wouldn't work with just you, Sam

01:36:58.566 --> 01:37:01.933
See, we had to bring the legacy characters
back to make it matter

01:37:03.033 --> 01:37:05.866
Can't have a bona fide Halloween
without Jamie Lee!

01:37:05.933 --> 01:37:06.933
Nope!

01:37:07.033 --> 01:37:08.533
Dewey had to die to make it real

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:11.000
To show that this
wasn't just some bullshit,

01:37:11.066 --> 01:37:14.133
cash-in, run-of-the-mill sequel

01:37:14.733 --> 01:37:18.233
Because our movie has fucking stakes!

01:37:19.366 --> 01:37:21.500
'Cause anyone can die in a requel

01:37:23.466 --> 01:37:24.666
No!

01:37:26.066 --> 01:37:28.166
Goddamn it Whoa, whoa!

01:37:28.233 --> 01:37:30.500
No, hey! Sit the fuck down

01:37:34.033 --> 01:37:36.066
I'm so sorry, Sid

01:37:36.633 --> 01:37:39.966
We can't let you live, either
I mean, surviving this many times...

01:37:40.733 --> 01:37:42.166
that would just be ridiculous

01:37:42.633 --> 01:37:45.700
This time the fans are gonna be
the ones who win

01:37:48.433 --> 01:37:51.066
- That about cover it?
- Nailed it, baby

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:55.833
Get Tara out of the closet
We got to start staging the bodies!

01:37:56.900 --> 01:38:00.233
Stay with me, Sid Stay with me

01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:02.466
You really should've listened to Dewey

01:38:02.566 --> 01:38:06.300
He nailed it in one!
Dude, look at the love interest!

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:07.800
Are you fucking stupid?

01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:09.933
I even had you convinced
it could be your sister

01:38:12.566 --> 01:38:14.266
She's not here

01:38:17.333 --> 01:38:19.400
What the fuck do you mean, she's not here?

01:38:19.466 --> 01:38:20.900
She's not here!

01:38:20.966 --> 01:38:22.400
I untied her

01:38:24.133 --> 01:38:26.433
Guess you're not
as persuasive as you thought

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:33.600
That's for you

01:38:34.633 --> 01:38:38.000
Yeah, like your gimpy little sister's
gonna make a difference

01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:40.300
She's our fucking pincushion
at this point

01:38:40.366 --> 01:38:43.366
Amber! Fan out
She couldn't have gotten far

01:38:43.466 --> 01:38:44.466
I can't find her!

01:38:51.566 --> 01:38:52.933
Amber?

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:18.833
Sam! Where you going?
Your big scene's coming up!

01:39:27.466 --> 01:39:28.700
Fucking kill you!

01:39:31.933 --> 01:39:33.466
The fucking hand sanitizer?

01:39:39.733 --> 01:39:42.500
No, no, no, it's not my fault!
It's not my fault!

01:39:42.566 --> 01:39:44.400
Let me guess, the movies made you do it?

01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:47.033
No, it was the message boards!
I was radicalized

01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:49.300
- By movie fans?
- Yes, they're so mad!

01:39:49.366 --> 01:39:51.042
Please, it's not my fault
I'm just a dumb kid

01:39:51.066 --> 01:39:52.566
I wanted to be a part of something

01:39:52.666 --> 01:39:55.833
"A part of something"?
You killed my best friend!

01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:57.966
Yeah, and he died like a pussy

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:13.300
That's the thing about slashers, Sam

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.466
So many blood trails

01:40:17.566 --> 01:40:18.933
This one yours?

01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.700
Only one way to find out!

01:40:28.366 --> 01:40:31.200
I was the last thing Dewey saw
before he died too

01:40:31.266 --> 01:40:33.366
I can't believe I get to do you both

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.100
No last-minute saves this time
Your story's over!

01:40:43.766 --> 01:40:45.533
Time to pass the torch

01:40:46.266 --> 01:40:47.766
It's all yours, bitch!

01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:54.300
- You want to do the honors?
- This one's yours

01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:02.100
No, stop, stop, stop!
I'm sorry about Dewey

01:41:02.166 --> 01:41:03.366
Fuck you

01:41:17.566 --> 01:41:19.066
Enjoy that torch

01:41:36.633 --> 01:41:37.800
Stop...

01:41:37.866 --> 01:41:39.133
fucking up...

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:40.966
my ending!

01:41:47.166 --> 01:41:48.266
Sam?

01:41:50.166 --> 01:41:51.300
Sam!

01:42:00.433 --> 01:42:01.633
Okay

01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:10.633
What are you gonna do now, huh?

01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:12.333
Make a scary phone call to me?

01:42:13.133 --> 01:42:16.200
Pop out of that closet
in a Ghostface mask?

01:42:16.966 --> 01:42:17.966
No

01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:20.500
Because you're the villain!

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:24.466
And the villain dies at the end

01:42:24.533 --> 01:42:26.166
Those are the rules

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:29.000
I'm introducing a new rule

01:42:30.666 --> 01:42:32.366
And what would that be? Huh?

01:42:33.833 --> 01:42:34.833
Well?

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:40.200
Never fuck
with the daughter of a serial killer

01:43:08.433 --> 01:43:10.933
What about... my ending?

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:17.700
Here it comes

01:43:55.066 --> 01:43:56.966
Careful, they always come back

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.333
Okay, then

01:44:18.233 --> 01:44:20.033
I still prefer The Babadook

01:44:33.966 --> 01:44:35.033
Are you okay?

01:44:35.133 --> 01:44:36.333
Are you good?

01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:47.600
I'm so sorry

01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:49.200
Excuse me

01:44:50.666 --> 01:44:51.700
Excuse me, sir

01:44:54.266 --> 01:44:56.500
-Hey
-Hey

01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:57.833
She's gonna be okay

01:45:10.466 --> 01:45:12.866
Can you take us
to a different hospital this time?

01:45:12.966 --> 01:45:14.000
Of course

01:45:17.066 --> 01:45:18.200
You ready to go?

01:45:23.566 --> 01:45:25.100
I'll be right back, yeah?

01:45:31.866 --> 01:45:33.066
Your vitals look good

01:45:34.166 --> 01:45:36.166
You sit tight for a draft, okay?

01:45:36.233 --> 01:45:38.333
Sidney Gale

01:45:41.233 --> 01:45:42.400
Thank you both

01:45:43.433 --> 01:45:44.433
For everything

01:45:46.366 --> 01:45:47.766
Are you gonna be all right?

01:45:48.933 --> 01:45:51.400
I'll survive I always do

01:45:52.266 --> 01:45:53.333
You were right...

01:45:54.033 --> 01:45:55.533
about not running

01:45:56.266 --> 01:45:57.566
Sorry about that

01:45:59.666 --> 01:46:00.666
How are you doing?

01:46:02.666 --> 01:46:04.066
Ask me in a few days

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.100
But at least I know
what I'm gonna write about

01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:09.666
What's that?

01:46:10.733 --> 01:46:11.733
Not this

01:46:12.266 --> 01:46:14.133
Those fuckers can die in anonymity

01:46:15.266 --> 01:46:18.800
But maybe something about a good man
who used to be the sheriff here once

01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:22.066
I'd like to read that story

01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:25.433
Can I ask you a weird question?

01:46:26.266 --> 01:46:27.500
Yeah

01:46:29.033 --> 01:46:30.400
Am I gonna be okay?

01:46:32.933 --> 01:46:33.933
Eventually

01:46:58.333 --> 01:46:59.433
Hey

01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:01.066
Wait Sam, Sam!

01:47:02.066 --> 01:47:03.066
Thank you

01:47:05.966 --> 01:47:07.866
Well, you're not going anywhere
without me

01:47:09.333 --> 01:47:10.500
Don't worry

01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:13.000
I'm gonna hold your hand
all the way there

01:47:17.066 --> 01:47:19.100
I can take care of her and her sister

01:47:19.166 --> 01:47:20.766
She's all ready for transportation

01:47:30.566 --> 01:47:34.966
25 years ago, almost to the day,
in this very house

01:47:35.033 --> 01:47:36.800
a tragic story ended

01:47:36.866 --> 01:47:40.133
Tonight, a new chapter came to a close

01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:42.466
Police do not have
a lot of information right now,

01:47:42.533 --> 01:47:44.200
as they are still collecting evidence

01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:47.466
As you can see,
this is a very active crime scene

01:47:47.533 --> 01:47:50.033
An unknown number of fatalities,
several injuries,

01:47:50.133 --> 01:47:53.633
some people being taken off
by ambulance right now as we speak

01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:55.200
This is a developing story...
