-Santi, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

08:05.267 --> 08:06.495
Welcome to this
legendary football club.

08:07.627 --> 08:09.504
I wanted to introduce you
to our coach.

12:59.787 --> 13:01.618
A very good day to all of you

13:02.107 --> 13:04.905
and thank you for coming

13:05.347 --> 13:09.386
to this very important presentation

13:09.707 --> 13:12.346
of one of the greatest players
in the world.

13:12.867 --> 13:14.346
Good luck in this team.

13:14.747 --> 13:16.624
Best wishes
and we place our hopes in you.

13:16.707 --> 13:18.186
Many thanks.

13:56.987 --> 13:58.705
How much do you think this one cost?

13:59.147 --> 14:00.626
I couldn't care less
if the BernabÃ©u goes bankrupt.

14:35.507 --> 14:38.180
The omelette. It's lunchtime.

20:47.107 --> 20:48.142
- Enrique!
- Come on, come on.

20:48.507 --> 20:50.099
- Did you bring the dough?
- Quick, before they catch us.

20:50.307 --> 20:51.740
OK, OK, this is for you
and this is for me.

20:53.627 --> 20:54.946
What's in that head of yours?

20:55.027 --> 20:57.825
What do you want?
For us to visit you in jail?

20:58.067 --> 20:59.056
Listen...

20:59.787 --> 21:03.939
...one false move,
and you will ruin your life forever.

21:04.027 --> 21:05.619
More ruined than it already is?

21:06.947 --> 21:09.700
Enrique, my love, don't say that.

21:10.987 --> 21:12.705
Look at that player, Munez.

21:13.427 --> 21:15.736
He didn't have anything, like you.

21:16.027 --> 21:17.346
Look at him now.

21:17.587 --> 21:21.182
Apart from that, what the hell
does that have to do with me?

21:24.027 --> 21:28.384
I'm going to tell you a secret.
That player is your brother.

22:56.147 --> 22:57.899
Let it breathe for one minute.

24:31.867 --> 24:34.586
ONE MONTH LATER

27:28.827 --> 27:29.816
Hi, Santiago.

27:30.267 --> 27:31.256
Hi, how are you?

27:32.907 --> 27:34.625
Hmm, Dolce?

27:35.707 --> 27:36.696
Dolce, yes, yes.

27:37.067 --> 27:38.216
Really good goal, eh?

27:38.307 --> 27:40.821
Thanks, but I only played
for seven minutes, so I wasn't...

27:41.147 --> 27:42.899
Well, you must be really tired then?

28:40.467 --> 28:42.662
OK, then,
you'll have to come on my TV show

28:42.747 --> 28:44.499
before the other channels grab you, no?

28:52.627 --> 28:55.266
You'll like it.

30:59.387 --> 31:01.582
I'd like to talk for a second
about this new arrival,

31:01.667 --> 31:03.385
the Mexican Santiago Munez

31:03.467 --> 31:06.220
who we see here entering
this restaurant looking very handsome.

31:06.307 --> 31:07.740
He's also a total fashion victim.

31:09.067 --> 31:11.501
- He'll be worse in the future.
- I really like his style.

31:11.947 --> 31:13.380
Is he more Prada, or more Dolce?

31:13.467 --> 31:15.298
Well, we 'll have to keep an eye on him.

31:15.467 --> 31:16.741
He 'll be Dolce & Gabbana.

31:16.827 --> 31:17.976
I'm betting on Prada.

31:18.747 --> 31:20.226
I'm not sure his girlfriend
will help much.

31:20.307 --> 31:21.786
She looks pretty, if a bit pale but...

34:35.467 --> 34:36.456
Hi, Santiago, yes.

34:37.187 --> 34:39.462
The thing is, my producers are crazy
about having you on the show.

34:39.547 --> 34:42.697
and I told them that, as a personal
favour, you would give me the exclusive.

34:43.706 --> 34:45.025
Hm, I don't know.

34:46.746 --> 34:48.179
You're not afraid, are you?

37:41.987 --> 37:43.739
Enrique, clean the ashtrays.

37:44.187 --> 37:45.939
No, I'm watching the football.

37:46.387 --> 37:47.979
When they pay you to watch TV,
you'll be loaded.

37:48.067 --> 37:50.103
Until then, get up and work,
like everybody else.

42:44.987 --> 42:46.784
What's wrong with you, man?
Can't you see I almost killed you!

42:47.027 --> 42:48.426
My name is Enrique, I'm your brother.

42:48.987 --> 42:50.181
What?

42:50.267 --> 42:51.416
My mother married your father,

42:51.507 --> 42:53.657
Hernan Munez in Mexico.

51:17.467 --> 51:21.540
Gavin, this was your first goal
in 17 games. How do you feel?

51:22.867 --> 51:27.622
It's a great day. I'm very happy.

51:28.747 --> 51:31.978
I'm going drinking with lots of girls.

51:32.587 --> 51:33.576
Good night.

51:33.667 --> 51:35.703
Hello, hothead.

51:35.787 --> 51:37.186
Hello.

51:37.267 --> 51:39.781
Look, I have the solution
to all your problems.

51:40.627 --> 51:41.662
Really?

51:42.867 --> 51:44.380
T equila, please.

51:45.347 --> 51:47.463
And I need you on my show tomorrow

51:47.547 --> 51:49.663
whilst you're still
playing for Madrid.

51:54.187 --> 51:55.666
You won't give up, will you?

51:57.227 --> 51:58.626
What do you think?

52:07.267 --> 52:08.302
Another?

52:08.387 --> 52:09.661
Another please.

52:11.227 --> 52:12.421
You started it. I didn't.

52:13.467 --> 52:14.456
Do you need a ride?

52:14.987 --> 52:16.056
No, thanks.
