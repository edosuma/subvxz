WEBVTT

00:22.022 --> 00:25.234
Actually drove
by Hollywood Station.

00:26.610 --> 00:29.572
Goddamn microwave forest.

00:29.613 --> 00:32.783
All those news vans lined up.

00:32.825 --> 00:37.037
Fucking L.A.

00:37.079 --> 00:39.373
City wants to blame this
on a cop.

00:39.415 --> 00:41.041
Already made up their minds.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.336
City doesn't decide.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.589
People have no idea.

00:46.630 --> 00:51.552
They have no fucking idea
what it takes to do this work.

00:55.306 --> 00:58.517
I didn't do Howard Elias, Bosch.

01:00.770 --> 01:05.357
I wouldn't waste a bullet
on that motherfucking shyster.

01:08.694 --> 01:11.322
I did, once.

01:11.363 --> 01:13.908
Have to kill a guy.

01:13.949 --> 01:16.577
You read about that
in my TEAMS report?

01:18.120 --> 01:19.914
Oscar Villanova.

01:19.955 --> 01:22.917
Male, Hispanic.

01:22.958 --> 01:25.336
It was a good shoot,

01:25.377 --> 01:28.214
everyone said, you know?

01:30.841 --> 01:33.219
But every October 12,
his birthday,

01:33.260 --> 01:35.679
I think about how
he's not getting any older.

01:38.682 --> 01:41.268
All our secrets come out
at some time, Frank.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.062
Maybe it's your time.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.109
I didn't kill Elias.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.613
I did Black Guardian.

01:55.366 --> 01:59.328
I did that one, Bosch.

01:59.370 --> 02:00.746
I'm not proud of it.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.001
Happened just like Harris said.

02:10.381 --> 02:12.842
Pencil in the ear,
squeal and confess.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.093
Heat of the moment.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.304
Thought we had our guy.

02:17.346 --> 02:21.308
I was so fucking angry.

02:21.350 --> 02:24.728
The Kincaid girl,
picturing her...

02:24.770 --> 02:28.148
tied up somewhere and alone,
scared.

02:30.568 --> 02:33.487
You'd have done the same thing,
Harry.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.866
You would've.

02:38.868 --> 02:41.704
Cops like us, we get stuff done.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.582
Who else knows?

02:44.623 --> 02:46.250
Terry Drake?

02:46.292 --> 02:48.711
Elias.

02:49.712 --> 02:52.423
Elias knew.

02:52.464 --> 02:53.841
Must have.

02:53.883 --> 02:56.135
How would Elias know?

02:56.176 --> 02:57.553
Put me on trial.

02:57.595 --> 02:59.638
Blow up my whole fucking life.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.391
Tell me about Friday night.

03:02.433 --> 03:05.644
I was home.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.230
Shit-faced. Counting the cracks
in the ceiling.

03:08.272 --> 03:11.901
Next thing I know,
I'm curled up on the floor

03:11.942 --> 03:14.904
with an empty bottle of Maker's
and my phone is ringing.

03:14.945 --> 03:18.198
It's my partner.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.036
Rook's at Angels Flight.
Come on down.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.497
Your wife with you?

03:26.874 --> 03:30.252
No, she was at her sister's.

03:30.294 --> 03:32.254
With my boy Liam.

03:35.132 --> 03:38.093
Oh, I drink alone, Harry.

03:38.135 --> 03:40.429
A lot.

03:40.471 --> 03:42.473
Okay.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.436
We'll go in together,

03:47.478 --> 03:49.480
tomorrow.

03:50.481 --> 03:52.524
Get a rep,

03:52.566 --> 03:55.027
get your side of the story
on record.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.236
Make it official.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.239
Fuck a rep.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.742
-I need a lawyer.
-Okay.

04:01.784 --> 04:04.370
All of it?

04:04.411 --> 04:06.330
Much as you can stomach.

04:06.372 --> 04:08.749
Shit.

04:08.791 --> 04:11.001
I don't know.

04:11.043 --> 04:13.963
Need to call your wife?

04:14.004 --> 04:16.840
No.

04:22.513 --> 04:26.266
You can crash here on the sofa.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.062
Yeah. Thanks.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.773
Okay.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.901
Oh, shit.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.040
Gun's dry, Harry.

04:50.082 --> 04:53.252
I got... scared of myself.

05:45.721 --> 05:48.390
- -

05:48.432 --> 05:49.641
- -

05:53.854 --> 05:55.105
- -

06:26.261 --> 06:29.264
-You need to get going, Jerry.
-Where's the milk?

06:29.306 --> 06:32.559
-The real milk.
-Almond milk is real milk.

06:34.353 --> 06:36.480
I've got plenty of time.

06:36.522 --> 06:37.981
The boys.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.234
Right. You don't want them
to see me here.

06:40.275 --> 06:43.779
I don't want to answer all the
questions after they see you.

06:43.821 --> 06:45.239
Help me get into the rig.

06:53.789 --> 06:56.750
Thought you were riding a desk.

06:56.792 --> 06:59.253
Gonna miss having me around
all the time?

07:00.546 --> 07:02.923
Not gonna miss the beard.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.758
-Yeah, okay. - Go.

07:10.889 --> 07:11.932
For real

07:11.974 --> 07:14.101
- -Bye.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.299
Frank.

08:10.574 --> 08:13.076
Maddie?

08:21.877 --> 08:23.754
Maddie?

08:39.186 --> 08:40.646
Hello?

08:40.687 --> 08:42.648
Eleanor?

08:42.689 --> 08:45.442
Reggie, thank God.

08:48.070 --> 08:49.613
Morning, gentlemen.

08:49.655 --> 08:51.406
Oh, maybe for you.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.784
We're up to our tits
in headless bodies.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.786
Headless body in a topless bar.

08:55.827 --> 08:58.497
-An oldie but a goodie.
-Bite me, Santiago.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.665
This caper
should have been yours.

08:59.706 --> 09:00.916
Hey, what do you want me to do?

09:00.958 --> 09:02.960
Call these people back,
would you?

09:03.001 --> 09:05.379
Particularly
this delightful creature.

09:05.420 --> 09:09.174
-She sounds hot
but not in a good way. -Mm.

09:19.935 --> 09:23.313
-Yes. -Ms. Duncan,
Detective Robertson.

09:23.355 --> 09:26.066
An L.A. Times reporter woke me
up this morning, Detective,

09:26.108 --> 09:28.610
asking about my relationship
with Howard Elias.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.612
What are you talking about?

09:30.654 --> 09:32.030
It broke online.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.866
Elias' mistress. My name.

09:34.908 --> 09:38.078
Ma'am, I promise you
it didn't come from me.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.289
Some radio shock jock
called my husband.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.374
Now he knows.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.709
Everybody knows.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.960
Look, Ms. Duncan,

09:45.002 --> 09:47.754
-I'm sorry, but...
-

09:47.796 --> 09:49.548
Hello?

09:51.008 --> 09:53.802
"The longer we wait to apprehend
Francis Sheehan,

09:53.844 --> 09:55.220
the more potential..."

09:55.262 --> 09:56.638
A little wordy.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.057
You're not writing a novel.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.184
But it's good, Pierce.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.603
I've been through I don't know
how many different angles

10:03.645 --> 10:06.565
of this Cal Plaza footage
already. Nothing.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.735
Maybe the shooter took
the cameras into account.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.611
If you chart
where the coverage isn't,

10:11.653 --> 10:13.030
you might find his path in
and out.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.496
Somebody told a reporter
about the mistress.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.539
Wasn't me.

10:23.582 --> 10:25.751
Jerry.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.169
Good to see you.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.421
Good to be seen.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.048
Another visitor, Rondell?

10:31.089 --> 10:33.550
No, he's on the task force.

10:33.592 --> 10:35.052
Got the call last night.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.974
Special Master says
these are the last of them.

10:41.016 --> 10:43.143
We sprung a leak to the press.

10:43.185 --> 10:45.645
And you assume it was us.
Thank you.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.856
Bosch know?

10:47.898 --> 10:50.359
Don't worry about me, Jimmy.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.069
I'm all in.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.864
Mrs. Sheehan?

10:55.906 --> 10:57.699
Yes, I'm Margaret.

10:57.741 --> 11:00.202
I'm Detective Bosch, LAPD.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.620
Is Frank home?

11:01.661 --> 11:03.455
Probably.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.332
If he's not at work,
he must be sleeping one off.

11:05.374 --> 11:06.750
Oh.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.460
Address we have for him.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.878
We split up.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.630
Two years ago.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.882
He comes back, time to time,
to see Liam.

11:13.924 --> 11:15.675
Has he come by recently?

11:16.676 --> 11:18.178
What's this about?

11:18.220 --> 11:21.181
Well, he was with me last night,
stayed at my place.

11:21.223 --> 11:23.433
- So he was drunk.
-No, no.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.102
He was supposed to come
to Hollywood Station with me

11:25.143 --> 11:26.353
this morning, give a statement.

11:26.395 --> 11:28.522
About that dead lawyer?

11:28.563 --> 11:30.399
I'm sure Frank didn't have
anything to do with that.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.858
So he says.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.362
Then shame on you.

11:35.404 --> 11:38.031
So much for the thin blue line.
I thought cops were supposed

11:38.073 --> 11:40.700
-to help each other out.
-I got to find him first.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.330
How long has he been like this?

11:45.372 --> 11:46.540
I told you.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.375
A couple years.

11:48.417 --> 11:49.793
Since Black Guardian.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.795
Frank didn't do that either,
okay?

11:51.837 --> 11:53.630
IA cleared him.

11:53.672 --> 11:56.425
He was a little messed up at
the time about something else.

11:56.466 --> 11:57.426
It was no one's fault.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.845
It was just...

12:02.013 --> 12:04.975
I've got his address somewhere.

12:05.016 --> 12:07.602
Hey, hold on.
I'll find it for you.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.589
Oh.

12:37.591 --> 12:40.302
There.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.712
Whoa! Hey!

13:35.190 --> 13:37.943
Uh, quiet, please. Quiet.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.111
Find a seat.
Settle down.

13:41.571 --> 13:44.449
LAPD killed Howard Elias.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.618
And why are the detectives that

13:46.660 --> 13:48.370
tortured Michael Harris
not already

13:48.411 --> 13:49.704
in police custody
for this murder?

13:49.746 --> 13:51.456
Miss, you're out of order.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.958
And why was Martin Elias
pulled in?

13:52.999 --> 13:54.709
Justice for Elias.
Right?

13:54.751 --> 13:56.962
-No justice, no peace!
-That's right.

13:57.003 --> 14:00.215
No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!

14:00.257 --> 14:02.759
No justice,
no peace!

14:02.801 --> 14:04.386
No justice, no peace!

14:04.427 --> 14:07.347
No justice,
no peace!

14:07.389 --> 14:09.182
-Quiet.
-No justice, no peace!

14:09.224 --> 14:12.018
-No justice, no peace!
-Quiet, please.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.354
-Ord... Quiet, please.
-No justice, no peace!

14:16.231 --> 14:17.232
You're not being fair
to the people

14:17.274 --> 14:18.608
who have waited patiently.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.111
Now, please.
Next speaker.

14:21.152 --> 14:24.281
Me?

14:24.322 --> 14:26.157
I came here to talk
about surveillance cameras

14:26.199 --> 14:27.576
in community gardens,

14:27.617 --> 14:29.619
but I want to hear
what's going on

14:29.661 --> 14:31.329
with the Howard Elias case, too.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.957
-That's right.
-Yeah! -Yeah! -Yeah!

14:33.999 --> 14:35.458
That's right, there!

14:35.500 --> 14:37.252
I'll tell you what's going on.

14:37.294 --> 14:38.753
The LAPD...

14:38.795 --> 14:41.089
Miss... Miss, you need
to take your turn.

14:41.131 --> 14:44.634
The LAPD cannot be trusted
to investigate their own.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.846
We need an outside,
impartial eye on this.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.348
Can we find someone to escort
this young lady out of the room?

14:50.390 --> 14:53.685
The LAPD needs to hand this case
over to the FBI, period.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.687
No justice, no peace.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.398
No justice,
no peace.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.317
-No, don't touch me. Don't
touch me. -No justice, no peace!

15:00.358 --> 15:02.068
-Don't... No!
-No justice, no peace!

15:02.110 --> 15:03.778
-No justice, no peace!
-Let the...

15:03.820 --> 15:05.280
- -Hey!
-Get your hands off of me!

15:05.322 --> 15:06.531
Let's get the commissioners
out of here.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.408
Let's go. Everyone, let's go.

15:08.450 --> 15:11.328
Everyone remain seated

15:11.369 --> 15:12.579
until the disrupters
have been detained.

15:12.621 --> 15:13.955
No justice, no peace!

15:13.997 --> 15:15.373
All right, let's go. All right.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.666
No justice, no peace!

15:16.708 --> 15:19.753
No justice,
no peace!

15:19.794 --> 15:22.005
You should've hauled Sheehan's
bony ass in here last night.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.506
Judgment call.

15:23.548 --> 15:24.966
Look, he's turned off his phone,

15:25.008 --> 15:26.593
cleaned out
his personal bank account.

15:26.635 --> 15:28.553
Transferred some to his wife's.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.097
Got anything solid
says he did Elias?

15:31.139 --> 15:32.682
Man's gone to ground.

15:32.724 --> 15:35.352
You fucked up.

15:39.648 --> 15:42.400
Oh. J. Edgar.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.195
-Help you with something?
-Nah. I'm here to help.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.696
Chief said something
about you asking

15:46.738 --> 15:48.073
for another real detective.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.161
Look, just because
he gave you a gun

15:53.203 --> 15:55.580
doesn't mean he didn't do Elias.
He could've used a drop.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.540
We all know he has
a backup duty weapon.

15:57.582 --> 16:00.418
-Then why admit to Black
Guardian? -He higged you, Bosch.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.128
-I don't think so.
I believe him. -So did they.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.089
Well, it wouldn't be the
first time a cop lied to IA.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.174
We asked Sheehan to come in,
he came to me instead.

16:06.216 --> 16:09.052
-Yeah, well, we still need his
statement on the record. -Okay.

16:09.094 --> 16:11.429
So, Jimmy, put some blue-suiters
on it, get him back.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.349
- -You clear the other
cops from the files?

16:14.391 --> 16:17.102
-Yeah, so far.
-It's Francis Sheehan.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.937
-Show me evidence.
-That depo

16:18.978 --> 16:21.898
where he threatened Elias
is a video. It's in archives.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.150
Go get it. Don't wait
for them to ship it to us.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.111
Is anybody else gonna go through
the Kincaid murder book?

16:26.152 --> 16:28.863
-We're here so nobody has to.
-Fresh eyes couldn't hurt.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.074
Oh, waste of time.
We went through it

16:31.116 --> 16:32.742
-with a fine-toothed comb for
Black Guardian. -

16:32.784 --> 16:34.703
Not fine enough
to comb out Sheehan's lies.

16:36.705 --> 16:39.457
Eleanor, you hold on a second?

16:39.499 --> 16:40.458
I don't mind doing it.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.544
-Good idea.
-In the meantime,

16:42.585 --> 16:44.087
let's get eyes
on Sheehan's house,

16:44.129 --> 16:45.714
wife, apartment, vehicles,

16:45.755 --> 16:48.007
and have a patrol
hang by his kid's school.

16:48.049 --> 16:49.592
What's up?

16:49.634 --> 16:51.761
I heard from Reggie
this morning.

16:51.803 --> 16:53.847
I could use some advice.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.181
About Reggie?

16:55.223 --> 16:56.558
Maddie.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.059
Is she okay?

16:58.101 --> 16:59.352
She's fine.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.354
Look, Harry,

17:01.396 --> 17:03.982
I know you're busy.
I just...

17:04.023 --> 17:07.152
No, no, no. Uh, Du-par's,
Farmers Market. 15.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.195
Thanks, Harry.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.991
- -

17:13.032 --> 17:15.368
Grace, you wanted to see me?

17:15.410 --> 17:18.288
Yeah, I'm looking over
Wozniki's CUBO complaint,

17:18.329 --> 17:20.498
trying to determine
the appropriate resolution.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.833
Now, you know her.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.127
Can we ever really know anyone?

17:24.169 --> 17:25.795
Oh, don't fuck with me, Thorne.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.464
I've got to write the LOT.

17:27.505 --> 17:28.798
How about a five-day hit?

17:28.840 --> 17:32.010
-That's Captain's job.
-

17:32.051 --> 17:34.637
You've only got one bar,
Grace, same as me.

17:34.679 --> 17:36.556
Fake it till you make it,
I guess.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.308
Excuse me?

17:38.349 --> 17:40.643
My two pesos,

17:40.685 --> 17:42.395
let's wait till
the real captain comes back.

17:42.437 --> 17:43.813
If he needs a rec,

17:43.855 --> 17:45.356
I'll be happy to give it then.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.533
What's this we're hearing

17:55.575 --> 17:57.535
about a permitted protest
this weekend?

17:57.577 --> 18:01.039
Culminating
at Hollywood Station.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.708
"Seeking Justice Now.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.044
"For all marginalized peoples
whose destinies

18:06.085 --> 18:08.087
are intertwined."

18:10.465 --> 18:12.008
Sounds like Black Lives Matter.

18:12.050 --> 18:14.010
It's not.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.720
But I don't doubt
they'll be there.

18:15.762 --> 18:19.307
Justice Now. The inspiration
of a UCLA grad student.

18:19.349 --> 18:20.809
Oh, Lord.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.727
Desiree Zealy.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.063
The mayor is concerned that,
given what happened

18:25.104 --> 18:26.523
at the commission
meeting this morning,

18:26.564 --> 18:28.191
this is recipe for a riot.

18:28.233 --> 18:31.110
I believe the preferred term
is "civil unrest."

18:31.152 --> 18:34.072
Whatever you want to call it,
we cannot let it turn into...

18:34.113 --> 18:37.116
No one is more aware of what
this could become than me.

18:37.158 --> 18:38.785
Fine.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.370
I'll tell the mayor that y...

18:40.411 --> 18:43.039
But riot gear
and a premature show of force

18:43.081 --> 18:45.041
will only inflame
what may otherwise be

18:45.083 --> 18:47.752
an uneventful exercise
in free speech.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.296
I would think civil unrest

18:50.338 --> 18:51.881
is the last thing
you would want,

18:51.923 --> 18:54.634
three months
into your tenure as chief.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.433
And I would think...

19:02.475 --> 19:06.104
City Hall and LAPD have
an equal stake in what happens.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.483
Course we do.

19:10.525 --> 19:11.985
Chief.

19:12.026 --> 19:14.028
Ms. Kowski.

19:28.126 --> 19:30.753
So...

19:30.795 --> 19:32.755
basically...

19:32.797 --> 19:34.340
my marriage is over.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.221
I think I spent
the last three months

19:40.263 --> 19:41.890
fooling myself that it wasn't.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.933
She's not a little girl.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.435
Just tell her the truth.

19:45.476 --> 19:46.936
That it's my fault?

19:48.855 --> 19:50.732
You need to get that?

19:50.773 --> 19:52.400
No.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.822
You and Reggie
should talk to her together.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.492
Reggie's not coming, Harry.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.078
Chinese government
took his passport,

20:04.120 --> 20:06.205
he can't travel.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.166
He spent two weeks in detention.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.751
Why?

20:09.792 --> 20:11.586
I don't know.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.630
Maybe because
of the work I was doing

20:13.671 --> 20:15.340
for Griffin over there.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.883
Reggie sure thinks so.

20:16.925 --> 20:19.636
Feds were investigating
Stanley Woo in China?

20:19.677 --> 20:21.512
Please.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.306
Dragon Head of the Wu Fu Triad.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.016
How does he not get looked at?

20:25.058 --> 20:27.477
You told me Reggie
walked away from his uncle

20:27.518 --> 20:29.812
and the family business
when he married you.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.314
Walked away.

20:31.356 --> 20:32.732
Walked back.

20:32.774 --> 20:35.360
Swell.
When were you gonna tell me?

20:35.401 --> 20:37.737
Organized crime is a fact
of China.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.155
Has been for a thousand years.

20:39.197 --> 20:40.865
Reggie doesn't think of it
the way we do.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.201
I don't care what Reggie thinks,
but our daughter...

20:43.242 --> 20:44.994
I know.

20:45.036 --> 20:47.664
That's why Maddie and I
stayed in Vegas

20:47.705 --> 20:50.750
when you got the job in Macao.

20:50.792 --> 20:52.502
Why'd you go back last year?

20:54.837 --> 20:58.216
I just... I wasn't ready
to give up on him.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.179
And then Griffin came to me
with an assignment.

21:03.221 --> 21:05.556
Help them see if family Woo

21:05.598 --> 21:07.475
was behind something
they were looking into,

21:07.517 --> 21:09.102
and I'd get my credentials back.

21:10.728 --> 21:13.856
I know, I know.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.525
I just thought
if I could show Reggie

21:15.566 --> 21:17.610
what his uncle was doing,
he would come back to us.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.905
Turns out his uncle
wasn't even involved.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.241
-In that.
-In that.

21:25.201 --> 21:29.497
Reggie found out,
we had this blow-out.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.252
Said I had to choose
between the FBI and him.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.883
your uncle, or Maddie and me."

21:40.925 --> 21:43.094
You did the right thing.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.763
I kept trying to convince myself

21:45.805 --> 21:47.181
that he was gonna choose us.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.976
And then, this morning...

21:52.311 --> 21:55.481
He's making a big mistake.

21:55.523 --> 21:58.651
I loved him, Harry.

21:59.944 --> 22:03.531
Past lives just
catch up with us.

22:05.366 --> 22:07.994
Can't change who we are.

22:08.036 --> 22:10.455
Not your fault.
Not his.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.498
Maddie takes the hit.

22:12.540 --> 22:15.460
She's a tough bird,
like her mama.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.878
She'll understand.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.424
That her mom is
a two-time loser?

22:21.466 --> 22:23.384
Come on, Eleanor.

22:28.473 --> 22:30.016
What's the matter with me?

22:30.058 --> 22:32.018
Not a thing.

22:34.604 --> 22:36.355
You should get back.

22:36.397 --> 22:38.107
-No, come on, Els, you don't
have to... -Look, this helped.

22:38.149 --> 22:40.568
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna tell her tonight.

22:40.610 --> 22:42.820
Els...

22:53.372 --> 22:56.000
Eleanor.
Phone.

23:00.880 --> 23:01.923
-Fuck!
-

23:20.691 --> 23:21.901
911. What is your emergency?

23:21.943 --> 23:23.653
Shots fired, officer down.

23:23.694 --> 23:27.740
Du-par's, at Farmers Market,
Third and Fairfax.

23:27.782 --> 23:29.826
Need an airship.

23:29.867 --> 23:33.329
Two suspects on a motorcycle,
headed east on Third.

23:33.371 --> 23:35.540
Stay on the line.

24:13.411 --> 24:15.204
Didn't care to come upstairs?

24:15.246 --> 24:16.581
Thought it would be better
to talk out here.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.833
Too many eyes and ears inside.

24:18.875 --> 24:20.126
Yeah. It must be hard for you.

24:20.168 --> 24:21.210
Look, I'm trying
to make it easier

24:21.252 --> 24:23.421
for your partner to come clean.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.299
-Where is he?
-Fuck off, Santiago.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.050
My partner didn't kill
that lawyer.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.677
Then why'd he rabbit?

24:31.387 --> 24:32.889
-You didn't know he was missing.
-He's not missing.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.265
Second call.

24:34.307 --> 24:35.808
-Second call.
-Yeah.

24:35.850 --> 24:37.351
Why don't you save
the cover for your captain?

24:37.393 --> 24:39.896
Frank's in the wind, man.
Act of a guilty man.

24:39.937 --> 24:41.731
You want to help your partner,
you'll help me.

24:41.772 --> 24:44.775
You sleep with dogs
and wake up with fleas.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.737
Like Rafael Perez, the rest
of your Rampart buddies.

24:47.778 --> 24:49.071
Yeah, you don't know
what you're talking about.

24:49.113 --> 24:50.364
Yeah, well, Drake told me

24:50.406 --> 24:52.074
that you'd do anything
to make a case.

24:52.116 --> 24:53.618
Even sell a good cop

24:53.659 --> 24:55.161
-down the river.
-Bullshit.

24:55.203 --> 24:56.787
Drake was the one who taught me

24:56.829 --> 24:58.414
good cops can't be sold.

24:58.456 --> 24:59.749
Yeah, you're a fucking rat.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.919
As long as I'm up there...

25:02.960 --> 25:04.962
you're down here.

25:15.056 --> 25:17.475
This the officer?

25:17.516 --> 25:19.018
Okay, sir, we got her.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.269
You can step aside.

25:20.311 --> 25:21.938
You injured?

25:21.979 --> 25:23.481
Sir?

25:23.522 --> 25:25.650
Sir, are you injured?

25:25.691 --> 25:27.693
No.

25:38.412 --> 25:39.705
Sir? Sir, I need you
to stay here.

25:39.747 --> 25:41.290
Her name was Eleanor Wish.

25:41.332 --> 25:43.251
Call the FBI Westwood office,

25:43.292 --> 25:45.753
-SAC Jay Griffin. -Please, sir,
I need you to stay.

25:45.795 --> 25:47.588
I got to go be with my daughter.
I'll come back.

26:23.165 --> 26:24.834
Ms. Zealy.

26:24.875 --> 26:27.211
Chief Irving wonders
if you have a minute.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.630
Yeah. Sure.

26:37.888 --> 26:38.931
Ms. Zealy.

26:38.973 --> 26:40.558
Should I be asking for a lawyer?

26:40.599 --> 26:43.311
No. No, we're just talking here.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.938
I see.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.440
Your strategy

26:47.481 --> 26:48.899
this morning was misguided.

26:48.941 --> 26:52.611
You need to bring in the FBI
on Elias.

26:52.653 --> 26:54.030
No indication of a hate crime

26:54.071 --> 26:55.656
-or a political motive.
-

26:55.698 --> 26:57.616
From where you sit,
no, I don't imagine there is.

26:57.658 --> 26:59.327
Take a breath, Ms. Zealy.

26:59.368 --> 27:00.911
Give my detectives a chance

27:00.953 --> 27:02.038
to do their job.

27:02.079 --> 27:04.206
A task force led by Harry Bosch?

27:04.248 --> 27:05.833
Bosch is an excellent
investigator.

27:05.875 --> 27:08.336
He's had eight
officer-involved shootings.

27:08.377 --> 27:11.130
This is the white man
you think is gonna drill down

27:11.172 --> 27:13.299
-to the truth?
-I do.

27:15.343 --> 27:17.303
Howard Elias was killed

27:17.345 --> 27:19.930
for being uppity enough
to take Black Guardian to trial.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.475
If we find proof of that,
I promise

27:22.516 --> 27:24.435
-we will act on it.
-No disrespect, Chief,

27:24.477 --> 27:26.020
but your promises
don't mean shit.

27:27.063 --> 27:29.148
This is bigger than you

27:29.190 --> 27:31.317
and the LAPD.
This goes back 400 years.

27:31.359 --> 27:32.735
And I'm sick of it.
I'm just sick.

27:34.779 --> 27:38.032
How does it help anyone
if your protest turns violent?

27:40.076 --> 27:42.453
You told us you would help
make things better.

27:42.495 --> 27:44.455
I can. I will.

27:44.497 --> 27:46.832
Put aside

27:46.874 --> 27:48.667
all this noise you make,
can you say the same?

27:54.382 --> 27:56.342
Can I go now?

28:04.517 --> 28:06.268
Chief, a shots fired call

28:06.310 --> 28:07.728
was just broadcast
over the radio.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.480
It's an FBI agent.

28:09.522 --> 28:11.857
Eleanor Wish.

30:42.716 --> 30:44.260
...outside Du-par's restaurant

30:44.301 --> 30:46.136
at the Farmers Market
on Fairfax.

30:46.178 --> 30:49.265
Emergency crews responded
to a call of shots fired

30:49.306 --> 30:51.016
at the crowded establishment

30:51.058 --> 30:53.352
and rushed the woman
to the hospital.

30:53.394 --> 30:55.062
The victim's name
has not been released,

30:55.104 --> 30:57.106
and authorities
have no further details

30:57.147 --> 30:58.691
about the murder at this time.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.234
We're going live to the scene.

31:00.276 --> 31:02.444
Thanks, Julie.
Eyewitnesses we've talked to

31:02.486 --> 31:04.113
say it happened very quickly.

31:04.154 --> 31:06.907
Two men dressed in black,
riding on one motorcycle,

31:06.949 --> 31:09.493
-opened fire...
-You talk to Harry?

31:09.535 --> 31:11.161
Call went straight
to voice mail.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.288
...parking lot just here.

31:12.329 --> 31:13.956
The motorcycle then sped off

31:13.998 --> 31:15.416
down the parking lot there

31:15.457 --> 31:16.875
and disappeared.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.919
-There were no other fatalities
-

31:18.961 --> 31:20.963
or injuries.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.929
I am so sorry.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.850
Harry.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.059
You seen Grace?

31:34.101 --> 31:35.227
-She's out.
-I got to go back.

31:35.269 --> 31:37.021
-I got you. Go.
-And Maddie.

31:37.062 --> 31:38.647
Yeah, I'll take her
to LaTonya's. Go.

31:47.489 --> 31:49.867
Come on.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.578
Harry. Bottom drawer of my desk.

32:03.631 --> 32:06.634
Harry, you and Maddie
need anything at all...

32:06.675 --> 32:08.927
I know. Thanks, buddy.

32:23.984 --> 32:26.362
Jimmy, I'm gonna be tied up
for a little while.

32:26.403 --> 32:27.821
Yeah.

32:27.863 --> 32:29.490
We'll press on.

32:31.867 --> 32:33.827
Shit.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.214
Hold up, hold up.

32:45.255 --> 32:47.341
Mads, what's the passcode

32:47.383 --> 32:48.842
for Mom's cell phone?

32:48.884 --> 32:51.970
0613.

32:52.012 --> 32:55.599
June 13.

34:06.462 --> 34:08.589
Eleanor, it's Jay.

34:08.630 --> 34:09.965
My brother's in town.

34:10.007 --> 34:12.509
Call me when you get this.

34:20.434 --> 34:22.478
He made her.

34:22.519 --> 34:25.856
Okay, but does this?

34:25.898 --> 34:27.941
Why?

34:29.943 --> 34:31.361
Oh, look, Bosch is here.

34:35.949 --> 34:38.202
What'd you have her doing?

34:38.243 --> 34:40.120
Detective, I'm deeply sorry.

34:40.162 --> 34:42.790
-You put her in the crosshairs.
-No, this came out of the blue.

34:42.831 --> 34:45.584
This came out of a situation
that you put her in.

34:45.626 --> 34:47.294
Eleanor was one of ours.

34:47.336 --> 34:49.463
The entire bureau is devastated.

34:49.505 --> 34:52.257
No one more than me.

34:52.299 --> 34:54.885
Just let us do our jobs.

34:54.927 --> 34:56.470
Job that got her killed.

34:58.514 --> 35:00.599
What were you two meeting about?

35:01.642 --> 35:04.102
She's the mother of my child.

35:06.146 --> 35:09.066
Agent Wang's gonna take
your statement.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.776
Anything you can tell us
would be helpful.

35:10.818 --> 35:12.653
That a one-way street?

35:12.694 --> 35:14.071
No.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.614
We'll share what we can.

35:17.241 --> 35:20.202
I'm so sorry, Detective.

35:20.244 --> 35:22.246
Truck's right over here.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.707
Hey, Bosch.

35:25.749 --> 35:27.459
You know where
her cell phone is?

35:27.501 --> 35:29.169
No.

35:35.092 --> 35:37.803
My dad got shot.

35:37.845 --> 35:39.888
Jack.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.186
You hungry?

35:48.564 --> 35:51.149
You want something to drink?

35:55.404 --> 35:57.614
I keep thinking
I should call her.

35:59.074 --> 36:02.369
Tell her this horrible thing
that happened.

36:16.925 --> 36:19.052
Thank you.

36:34.276 --> 36:37.195
She can stay
as long as she needs.

36:37.237 --> 36:38.780
How's Harry?

36:38.822 --> 36:40.824
Only saw him for a second.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.622
I called your desk.

36:46.663 --> 36:48.749
Barrel picked up.

36:48.790 --> 36:51.501
Said you were working
the Elias task force.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.670
That's Harry.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.590
Well, I'm pushing paper
for them, not...

36:58.342 --> 37:02.387
You want this,
us to have a chance?

37:02.429 --> 37:04.431
Don't lie.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.039
- -

37:29.081 --> 37:31.208
Jesus Christ.

37:53.689 --> 37:56.066
Sorry to keep you waiting.

37:59.736 --> 38:02.948
Stress of these situations
can be dehydrating.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.994
I'm good.

38:08.203 --> 38:10.247
Right.
Let's get started.

38:12.666 --> 38:16.253
Today's date is March 27, 2017,

38:16.294 --> 38:17.921
and the time is 1330 hours.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.548
My name is
Special Agent Lulu Wang.

38:19.589 --> 38:22.551
I am currently within the FBI
mobile command vehicle,

38:22.592 --> 38:24.261
which is parked outside
the crime scene

38:24.302 --> 38:26.179
located at Fairfax
and Third Street.

38:26.221 --> 38:28.015
Present in the vehicle
with me is...

38:31.059 --> 38:34.938
Detective three, Harry Bosch,
LAPD, Hollywood Division.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.107
I'm putting
the Mobile Field Force off-site,

38:37.149 --> 38:41.069
and the officers who are up to
date in de-escalation on point.

38:43.155 --> 38:44.865
Chief?

38:44.906 --> 38:47.951
Sorry. Go on.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.871
I don't want a hint of riot gear
until it's necessary,

38:50.912 --> 38:52.581
especially with CNN
around the corner.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.416
How's Bosch?

38:56.126 --> 38:59.337
He's, um...
still talking to the feds.

38:59.379 --> 39:01.339
Was he close to his ex?

39:02.758 --> 39:05.260
The one who got away.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.324
Detective.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.743
She'll be missed.

39:29.785 --> 39:32.746
I need to pick up
some things for my daughter.

39:32.788 --> 39:34.790
Sure.

39:47.594 --> 39:49.971
I don't think
I'm out of school telling you

39:50.013 --> 39:51.515
this did not make sense.

39:53.183 --> 39:55.143
You working the murder
or the operation?

39:55.185 --> 39:57.687
Both.
I was Eleanor's handler.

39:57.729 --> 40:01.066
She talk to you about the case?

40:01.108 --> 40:04.111
I already told Agent Wang
everything I know.

40:04.152 --> 40:06.571
Okay.

40:06.613 --> 40:10.909
Anyone else know about
your meeting with her today?

40:10.951 --> 40:12.953
Anyone?

40:12.994 --> 40:14.621
We're starting.

40:14.663 --> 40:16.373
Her husband called from China.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.583
They took his passport.
Were you aware of that?

40:29.052 --> 40:30.387
Where is that?

40:30.428 --> 40:32.681
Borrego Springs.

40:32.722 --> 40:34.641
Beautiful.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.942
I took this picture.

40:46.486 --> 40:48.363
I need a minute.

40:48.405 --> 40:51.283
Sure. No rush.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.193
Just heard about Bosch.

41:27.444 --> 41:29.446
Yeah.

41:33.617 --> 41:36.411
Sheehan's depo.
See what we got.

41:57.557 --> 41:59.851
Police!

41:59.893 --> 42:02.187
We have a warrant
to search the premises.

42:05.023 --> 42:07.192
He's a suspect.
Knock it down.

42:17.285 --> 42:19.454
Clear.
-MAN 2: Clear.

42:19.496 --> 42:21.331
Clear.

42:26.836 --> 42:28.213
Keep your eyes open.

42:28.255 --> 42:29.673
Sheehan has lots of friends.

42:29.714 --> 42:32.092
You never know
where their loyalties fall.

42:34.511 --> 42:36.638
Okay, glove up.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.682
After photos,
like the warrant says,

42:38.723 --> 42:40.892
anything and everything
that might tell us

42:40.934 --> 42:43.061
where Francis Sheehan's gone.

42:43.103 --> 42:45.230
And smashing Mr. Vernon's
face into the ground

42:45.272 --> 42:47.482
was Detective Rooker's
standard tactic?

42:47.524 --> 42:50.193
No, sir.
Nobody ever said anything

42:50.235 --> 42:52.320
about anyone smashing a face
into the ground.

42:52.362 --> 42:55.532
Did it ever occur to you
that the reason

42:55.573 --> 42:57.492
Mr. Vernon couldn't stay still,

42:57.534 --> 43:00.578
why he was flailing around,
was because he couldn't breathe?

43:01.997 --> 43:03.540
You know,
if he couldn't breathe,

43:03.581 --> 43:05.542
he probably wouldn't have been
running his mouth

43:05.583 --> 43:08.586
talking about
how he couldn't breathe, right?

43:08.628 --> 43:10.297
He forget
the camera was rolling?

43:10.338 --> 43:12.048
What

43:12.090 --> 43:13.717
No.

43:13.758 --> 43:15.552
No, I don't.
You ask me, I think

43:15.593 --> 43:17.887
the whole thing's
fucking ridiculous, you know?

43:17.929 --> 43:20.348
You giving my partner
all this crap,

43:20.390 --> 43:21.808
putting him through
all this shit

43:21.850 --> 43:23.601
so you can bank your hot third.

43:23.643 --> 43:28.398
Bad behavior, but doesn't really
rise to the level of a threat.

43:44.331 --> 43:46.916
Oh, yeah.

43:46.958 --> 43:49.377
You got something?

43:56.801 --> 43:59.179
Are you aware

43:59.220 --> 44:01.014
Detective Rooker had
a domestic violence complaint

44:01.056 --> 44:02.599
from an ex-girlfriend?

44:02.640 --> 44:04.309
Are you aware
that it never happened

44:04.351 --> 44:07.812
and that the bitch was lying?
So fuck you, Elias!

44:07.854 --> 44:09.647
Frank.
-SHEEHAN: You motherfucker.

44:09.689 --> 44:11.608
Some day someone's gonna put
a fucking cap in your ass!

44:11.649 --> 44:13.818
Calm down,
Frank. Just have a seat.

44:13.860 --> 44:16.154
No, I'm done.
-That is a threat.

44:50.313 --> 44:52.399
You need anything, you call me.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.818
-I will.
-Okay.

45:00.698 --> 45:03.034
Thanks.

45:03.076 --> 45:05.870
You doing all right, Harry?

45:11.584 --> 45:13.795
You give this to Jerry?

45:15.338 --> 45:17.090
Tell him I'll...

45:17.132 --> 45:18.508
I'll send him the passcode.

45:18.550 --> 45:20.176
He'll know what to do.

45:25.432 --> 45:27.809
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

46:23.114 --> 46:25.241
Mads, where you going?

46:25.283 --> 46:26.826
My room.

46:31.372 --> 46:33.249
We can talk if you want.

46:35.293 --> 46:37.212
Why aren't you more upset?

46:37.253 --> 46:40.340
Oh. No, honey, I... I am.

46:40.381 --> 46:42.550
Me and Mom should have gone
to Hong Kong.

46:42.592 --> 46:43.885
None of this would have
ever happened

46:43.927 --> 46:45.678
if we had been there
and not here.

46:45.720 --> 46:49.140
No, no, no, no, no, no, don't,
no, this is not your fault.

46:49.182 --> 46:51.142
I want to see her.
-No.

46:51.184 --> 46:54.187
No, honey, you don't want
to see her, not like this.

46:54.229 --> 46:55.980
I know where she is.
I don't care.

46:56.022 --> 46:57.398
You could get me in.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.442
I don't think
that's a good idea.

47:03.655 --> 47:06.574
Reggie should know.

47:06.616 --> 47:09.827
Let me tell him. I don't want
you talking to him right now.

47:09.869 --> 47:11.621
Why?

47:11.663 --> 47:14.082
Might not be safe.

47:14.123 --> 47:17.502
Safe?

47:17.544 --> 47:19.170
What are you...?

47:19.212 --> 47:21.005
Reggie loves Mom.
He loves me.

47:21.047 --> 47:23.007
-I...
-I don't...

47:23.049 --> 47:25.385
-Why would you ever say that?
-No, no. Honey, I'm...

47:25.426 --> 47:27.845
I'm, uh...

47:34.727 --> 47:37.647
Shit.

47:40.275 --> 47:43.236
Shit.

48:00.878 --> 48:03.715
Bosch, I just got word.

48:03.756 --> 48:05.550
Please accept my condolences.

48:08.052 --> 48:11.556
Harry, fuck. I am so sorry.

48:11.598 --> 48:13.975
We all loved...

48:15.435 --> 48:17.270
Bosch, it's Pell at RHD.

48:17.312 --> 48:19.897
We have a POI in River Watch.

48:19.939 --> 48:22.692
Get back to me or Bennett.
We'll fill you in.
