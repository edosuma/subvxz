01:12.722 --> 01:15.826
Watch where you're going, bitch!

01:16.026 --> 01:18.929
- What?
- Thanks for cutting me off!

01:19.029 --> 01:21.565
You almost took my
side view mirror off, slut!

01:21.965 --> 01:26.270
You're lucky I have to be somewhere,
or I'd fuck your ass up right now.

01:26.370 --> 01:28.970
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

01:37.747 --> 01:39.023
Did you call me a slut back there?

01:39.123 --> 01:41.383
Yeah. I don't even know
where that came from.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.870
- You ready to get proud?
- Oh, dude. Dude.

01:59.970 --> 02:02.606
I'm here. I'm queer.

02:02.906 --> 02:05.073
Better get used to it.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.812
Oh, maybe I shouldn't touch you
so people won't think we're together.

02:08.913 --> 02:11.549
Oh, yeah. Get off me.
Stop cock-blocking me.

02:11.649 --> 02:14.251
- Vagina-blocking?
- No. Still cock-blocking.

02:14.351 --> 02:18.320
- Doesn't make sense. There's two vaginas.
- I don't know. Nobody ever changed it.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.964
Thank you for coming
to Pride with me today.

03:34.064 --> 03:37.181
Thank you for letting me sleep over.
I was way too tired to drive home.

03:37.281 --> 03:40.871
As usual. Wait. Hey. Get... Get up.

03:41.171 --> 03:42.606
- What?
- Wrong pillow.

03:42.706 --> 03:47.742
You like this one, stupid. Orthopedic.
Curvy. Fits your head.

03:50.847 --> 03:53.148
Oh, you're right.

04:01.891 --> 04:03.727
No.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.494
No.

04:07.264 --> 04:10.280
Wait. No, what about that girl?
She's really cute,

04:10.380 --> 04:13.871
and she lives two miles away.
You could... You could walk over there.

04:14.371 --> 04:17.575
And then if you don't like her,
you could just walk home.

04:17.774 --> 04:19.942
- All right. Maybe later.
- Why not now?

04:20.043 --> 04:23.514
Because it's 2:00 a.m.
That's a really bad first impression.

04:23.614 --> 04:27.885
She'll probably imagine me, like,
laying in bed flicking it.

04:27.985 --> 04:30.352
Flicking. Yes. Yes.

04:34.223 --> 04:36.024
Are you feeling yourself up?

04:37.193 --> 04:40.297
I have this weird dent in my left boob.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.634
Is that a thing? Like a reverse tumor?

04:43.834 --> 04:45.767
What? Let me see.

04:47.036 --> 04:48.727
No. I don't see anything.

04:48.827 --> 04:50.850
- I see it.
- Oh, God!

04:50.950 --> 04:53.806
This is why I don't have a boyfriend.
'Cause I spend all my time having sleepovers

04:53.906 --> 04:56.677
and staring at my lesbian
best friend's boobs.

04:56.877 --> 05:00.251
You don't have a boyfriend
because you're way too picky.

05:00.351 --> 05:04.388
I just wanna meet a guy that I like as
much as you. Is that too much to ask for?

05:04.488 --> 05:09.493
Yes. Yes, it is.
I hate everyone but you.

05:11.030 --> 05:12.060
We're screwed.

05:19.202 --> 05:22.039
Hey, I'm Shawneen,
and I'm from Omaha, Nebraska.

05:22.139 --> 05:24.575
I've never really
considered myself pretty.

05:24.975 --> 05:28.946
Yeah, right, Shawneen. I don't buy for
a second you don't think you're pretty.

05:29.046 --> 05:30.948
You're on a show called
America's Next Top Model.

05:31.048 --> 05:34.818
- You obviously think you're pretty.
- She reminds me of Amanda from Cycle 3.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.788
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Her eyes, they're so weird.

05:37.888 --> 05:40.257
- Oh, Sasha.
- What?

05:40.357 --> 05:43.227
Amanda's eyes look like that
because she was legally blind,

05:43.327 --> 05:47.064
and I heard after the show
she went full-on blind.

05:47.164 --> 05:48.863
Whoops.

05:51.935 --> 05:55.072
- Do you want this?
- No. No. I'm starting a new case tomorrow.

05:55.172 --> 05:59.610
It's my first one without the partners.
I gotta be firing on all cylinders.

05:59.710 --> 06:05.449
Well, lucky me. I don't have to fire on any
cylinders to answer the phone all day.

06:05.549 --> 06:09.017
- I can crash here, right?
- Yeah, sure.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.796
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

06:18.896 --> 06:21.298
- Give me.
- Guys, quick question.

06:21.936 --> 06:24.335
Is Vanessa looking over here?

06:24.883 --> 06:29.537
- Sasha, is she talking to someone?
- I don't know. Jenn, look for yourself.

06:30.239 --> 06:33.010
Jen, is she? Is she?

06:33.110 --> 06:35.946
- Yeah. She seems pretty into some girl.
- God.

06:36.746 --> 06:38.215
Well, you know what? That's funny.

06:38.315 --> 06:41.218
'Cause I hope some girl knows
that Vanessa isn't in the mind space

06:41.318 --> 06:43.487
to be monogamous right now, so...

06:43.587 --> 06:46.624
Jenn, you have to get over this
Vanessa thing. It's been like six months.

06:46.724 --> 06:49.793
I'm over it completely.
I just think it's funny that she said that,

06:49.893 --> 06:52.529
and then she started dating someone
monogamously like a week later.

06:52.629 --> 06:56.000
It's just, like, insanely funny to me.
Is it not to you? Like, what?

06:56.100 --> 06:57.073
Jen.

07:00.003 --> 07:03.173
Oh, my God,
why is every lesbian named Jen?

07:03.273 --> 07:05.642
I know. It's annoying.
That's why I spell mine with two N's.

07:05.742 --> 07:07.778
I'm Jen 1.0.

07:07.878 --> 07:10.914
Why do you say that like that's
a good thing? 2.0 is better than 1.0.

07:11.014 --> 07:14.018
Maybe to you.
Could you not sit so close to me?

07:14.118 --> 07:15.919
I don't want anyone to
think that we're together.

07:16.119 --> 07:21.442
Oh, my God. Okay, but there's no one
here that we don't already know anyway.

07:21.542 --> 07:25.312
- I'm telling you, there is no one left.
- Well, there are at least two people left

07:25.412 --> 07:29.324
because Paige and I both have
dates tomorrow night. Thank you.

07:29.424 --> 07:33.554
Really? Oh, that's... that's...
that's great. That's awesome.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.757
Yeah, we got drunk and agreed to go
on Internet dates on the same night.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.361
- And she is going out with a doctor.
- Yeah.

07:40.961 --> 07:44.031
What? What...
What is wrong with this one?

07:44.431 --> 07:47.802
He just says douchey things in his e-mails,
quotes a lot of movies...

07:47.902 --> 07:50.637
and says things like,
"You betcha" and "Gotcha."

07:50.737 --> 07:54.275
And in a couple of his photos,
he's wearing, like,

07:54.375 --> 07:59.511
T-shirts with messages on them
and slogans. I think it's like his style.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.582
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

08:03.315 --> 08:05.392
- I like the shirt, so...
- It's great.

08:05.492 --> 08:07.721
- That one says a positive message.
- It's true.

08:08.621 --> 08:11.550
What about you, Sasha? Do we know her?
Who's your date with?

08:11.650 --> 08:15.162
Well, you might. Have you ever seen
the show To Catch a Predator?

08:15.262 --> 08:17.931
- I love that show.
- Well, she was on it.

08:18.031 --> 08:21.635
My date was on To Catch a Predator. She works
for the agency that catches the predator.

08:21.735 --> 08:26.273
She... She goes online and flirts with
old dudes, pretending to be a 14-year-old.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.756
- Oh, my God.
- Please marry her. She's a celebrity.

08:28.856 --> 08:31.879
Yeah. Yeah. I might.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.548
Oh, God, it's so funny.

08:34.648 --> 08:37.951
I just always had this feeling that
everyone was gonna couple up before me.

08:38.051 --> 08:41.019
I mean, it's fine. I just think
it's funny that I called it.

08:56.068 --> 08:58.005
Hey, what's up? I'm Trace.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.607
- Sasha.
- Nice to meet you.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.175
- Nice to meet you too.
- What's up?

09:01.275 --> 09:04.211
- Not much. How are you?
- Oh. I'm sorry I'm late.

09:04.311 --> 09:07.779
Man, I had an intense day at work.

09:11.852 --> 09:15.823
- What was intense about it?
- I went on a sting today.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.890
Took down a board on a 4chan.

09:20.759 --> 09:23.063
Oh. I... What is 4chan?

09:23.863 --> 09:27.134
Oh. 4... Yeah, 4chan's an...
anonymous message board.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.835
Used to be an image hosting site.
Now it's a hotbed for pedophilia.

09:31.537 --> 09:33.605
Crazy. Disturbing.

09:35.107 --> 09:36.274
Oh, my God.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.279
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

09:39.379 --> 09:43.483
It's so fucking annoying 'cause, like,
I'm here, and I just want to drink,

09:43.583 --> 09:47.387
and this guy is staring at me.
I think he recognizes me from TV.

09:47.977 --> 09:49.813
Oh, my God.

09:52.125 --> 09:56.261
Buddy, you got a pen?
You want an autograph?

09:57.263 --> 09:59.699
No? Yeah, I didn't think so.

10:00.912 --> 10:02.423
Weird.

10:03.535 --> 10:07.908
You are so beautiful.
God, you're beautiful. Wow.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.609
Who tells you you're beautiful...
other than me?

10:19.051 --> 10:22.255
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...
It's really quiet in here.

10:22.355 --> 10:26.627
All I can hear are mouth sounds.
I'm gonna put on some music.

10:27.854 --> 10:31.364
- Are you a control freak?
- What? No.

10:31.464 --> 10:35.869
No? Well, I just thought there's this
and then you have, like, four recycling bins.

10:35.969 --> 10:40.474
Well, I am an environmental lawyer
and clearly a better person than you.

10:40.574 --> 10:43.243
Well, I don't know about that.
I'm the best there is.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.846
I wake up in the morning.
I piss excellence.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.414
What?

10:48.879 --> 10:51.384
Ricky Bobby, Talladega Nights.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.554
Oh. I haven't seen that.

10:53.654 --> 10:56.291
Well, as long as you've seen Lebowski.

10:56.391 --> 10:59.023
Well, I've seen the first half of it.

10:59.425 --> 11:00.294
What?

11:01.594 --> 11:05.233
Are you saying you watched the first half
of The Big Lebowski, then you shut it off?

11:06.233 --> 11:10.470
I... I feel like you're treating me as though
I just told you that I'm a sex offender.

11:10.970 --> 11:14.542
Wow. That... I mean, this is
much worse, I have to tell you.

11:15.992 --> 11:17.586
My goodness.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.614
- Are you married?
- What?

11:21.314 --> 11:24.151
- "Husband" is calling you.
- Oh. No.

11:24.251 --> 11:27.921
That's my best friend Sasha.
We just have this stupid joke.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.188
Okay, I'll prove it to you.

11:32.758 --> 11:33.806
Hi, Sasha.

11:33.906 --> 11:37.831
Okay, you're answering the phone, which means
you had just as shitty of a date as I did.

11:37.931 --> 11:41.318
Or you just got really wasted and fucked him
like an hour into it and he's already gone.

11:41.418 --> 11:43.670
Remember that?
What was that guy's name, Cory...

11:43.770 --> 11:45.006
I'll call you back.

11:46.606 --> 11:49.676
- Cory?
- That...

11:49.776 --> 11:52.880
- It only took Cory an hour?
- I...

11:53.480 --> 11:55.315
I don't usually do things like that...

11:55.415 --> 11:58.785
- What were his moves?
- It was...

11:58.885 --> 12:01.054
- You know what? I'm over it.
- Okay.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.789
It's fine.

12:03.289 --> 12:05.271
We all have our Corys.

12:40.493 --> 12:43.897
There you are. How was your date?

12:44.097 --> 12:47.234
- You first.
- Where do I start?

12:47.434 --> 12:50.825
Well, she is a baritone.

12:50.925 --> 12:53.774
She has a tattoo of the
female symbol on her wrist,

12:53.874 --> 12:56.910
and her license plate says
"BABY BOI," with an "I."

12:57.110 --> 12:59.646
- Are you peeing?
- Yeah.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.048
I love how you call me
right before you pee...

13:02.148 --> 13:04.417
instead of just waiting
the 10 seconds till you're done.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.386
Hold on one second.

13:07.492 --> 13:09.656
You're on speaker now.
I'm brushing my teeth.

13:09.756 --> 13:15.128
I think that my favorite part of the date
was when she put up two fingers...

13:15.428 --> 13:18.262
and said... "Sit on it."

13:18.732 --> 13:20.205
What? Why?

13:20.305 --> 13:23.501
I don't know.
I think she thought she was flirting.

13:24.471 --> 13:29.075
So, how was your date with "Gotcha"?
Was he wearing a message tee?

13:29.375 --> 13:30.644
He was.

13:30.744 --> 13:34.214
And he quotes movies a lot.
I didn't even get most of the references.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.284
Like, "I wake up in the morning
and piss excellence."

13:37.384 --> 13:39.350
Talladega Nights.

13:39.795 --> 13:45.258
Well, I guess we're gonna
end up dying alone like planned.

13:46.108 --> 13:50.764
Actually, he asked me out again,
and I said yes.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.766
I don't know.
I kind of had fun with him.

13:54.722 --> 13:57.235
Cool. When are you guys going out again?

13:57.970 --> 13:59.537
Tomorrow.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.307
Which one of us is the lesbian?

14:21.560 --> 14:23.705
Fuck.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.544
Hey. I didn't see you in there.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.846
You didn't see my car either?

14:40.449 --> 14:43.181
Well, it was blocking my driveway, so...

14:45.216 --> 14:49.289
I wouldn't say it's blocking your driveway.
It's got a pretty wide berth here.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.358
Yeah, but you're over the line.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.526
- Over the line?
- Yeah.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.560
This... The line.

14:56.362 --> 14:59.166
Yeah, well, even if I were
over the line,

14:59.266 --> 15:01.900
I don't think that means you
can just run into my car.

15:02.935 --> 15:06.671
I'm gonna be late for work, so can we just
deal with this later since we're neighbors?

15:07.606 --> 15:09.576
I should report this
to my insurance today.

15:09.676 --> 15:13.330
I mean, it's a brand-new car. My wife
would kill me. You're insured, right?

15:13.880 --> 15:15.982
- Of course I'm insured.
- Okay.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.848
I really don't see how this is my fault.

15:18.984 --> 15:23.688
Yeah. Well, you know, we can just let
the insurance companies deal with all that.

15:28.157 --> 15:29.796
Okay.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.633
There you go. Thank you.

15:34.733 --> 15:36.870
- Drive safe.
- I always do.

15:56.422 --> 15:59.090
You... You got it.

16:25.201 --> 16:28.820
Grossman Properties. Please hold.

16:40.999 --> 16:44.070
- Busy day?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

16:44.470 --> 16:48.106
Finished everything I had to do,
so I thought I'd catch up on the news.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.577
Will you make sure this goes out today?

16:52.935 --> 16:54.635
Yeah. Of course.

16:54.735 --> 16:58.352
And maybe you can work on separating the
mail since you're not doing anything else.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.588
Oh, I already did it.
Took like 10 minutes.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.290
Okay, well, in general,
whenever you have downtime,

17:04.391 --> 17:07.684
which I don't remember having
when I had your job. But since you do,

17:07.784 --> 17:11.314
it might be a good idea for you to read
something related to the company.

17:11.414 --> 17:13.550
We just started construction
on five projects this week.

17:13.650 --> 17:15.417
Are you familiar with all of them?

17:15.718 --> 17:20.457
Not yet. But that's great advice.
Thank you, Valerie.

17:20.557 --> 17:23.124
- Great. Okay.
- Bye.

17:27.329 --> 17:30.339
- It didn't...
- I'm sorry. That didn't buzz you in?

17:30.439 --> 17:32.567
- No.
- Okay. Try again.

17:34.337 --> 17:36.339
- Did you get it?
- No. It's still...

17:36.539 --> 17:38.241
One more time.

17:39.116 --> 17:39.991
I just...

17:40.474 --> 17:43.414
It's been acting up all morning.
I'm sorry. Got it?

17:43.514 --> 17:46.280
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Okay. Bye.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.262
Hey!

17:59.362 --> 18:02.130
Open up. I gotta poop in your toilet.

18:04.132 --> 18:05.869
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.772
Sasha, I'm Tim.

18:09.572 --> 18:11.407
- Hi. Oh, God. Yeah.
- Hi.

18:11.507 --> 18:16.179
How are you? I'm sorry. Did Paige not
tell you that I was crashing your TV night?

18:16.831 --> 18:20.050
- No. It's okay.
- Come on in.

18:20.150 --> 18:22.819
I'm sorry that I was so gross
about the bathroom thing before.

18:22.919 --> 18:26.189
I just didn't know
anyone else was here, and I...

18:26.289 --> 18:27.857
- Hey, everybody poops.
- Yeah.

18:27.957 --> 18:31.153
Oh, good. You two met.
I'll go get the wine.

18:31.253 --> 18:34.495
- Okay. I'll go help her.
- Nice to meet you.

18:37.065 --> 18:40.003
Dude. Why didn't you tell me
Tim was gonna be here?

18:40.103 --> 18:41.938
I didn't know until like an hour ago.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.774
He called me on his way home from work,
and I thought it'd be real fun.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.897
Well, I wish you would have warned me
because then I wouldn't have...

18:47.997 --> 18:50.514
worn pajama pants
with a hole in the dick.

18:50.614 --> 18:53.216
You're wearing makeup
and real clothes. You look pretty.

18:53.316 --> 18:56.286
The guy is wearing a braided belt.
He's not judging.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.221
And he knows we're watching
Top Model, right?

18:58.321 --> 19:02.425
Yeah. He's never seen it before.
How fun is this gonna be?

19:03.225 --> 19:05.261
My mom was my rock,

19:05.361 --> 19:08.598
and she... you know, gave me strength.

19:08.698 --> 19:13.203
- Wait, now, didn't her mom abandon her?
- Yes, but it's complicated.

19:15.230 --> 19:17.040
...I know that...

19:17.340 --> 19:19.776
Okay, now, what does a tea ceremony
have to do with modeling?

19:19.876 --> 19:21.678
Just watch it,
and I'll explain it to you later.

19:21.778 --> 19:25.947
Okay. I'm gonna remember this
when I'm making you watch Lebowski.

19:27.015 --> 19:29.953
- You've never seen Big Lebowski?
- Thank you.

19:30.053 --> 19:32.956
- I've seen the first half of it.
- The first half?

19:33.056 --> 19:34.624
It's actually pretty funny.

19:34.724 --> 19:38.027
- "Do you see what happens, Larry?"
- What?

19:38.127 --> 19:43.766
"Do you see what happens
when you fuck a stranger in the ass?"

19:44.768 --> 19:47.758
- Oh, right. That's from the movie.
- Okay.

19:51.606 --> 19:55.445
- Now, those two are sisters, right?
- Which two?

19:55.545 --> 19:57.847
That one and the... Wait.
They're not showing her.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.482
Okay, wait. That one
and then that one right there.

19:59.582 --> 20:02.085
Actually, they hate each other
'cause they're both Latinas,

20:02.185 --> 20:05.621
and they know that one Latina's
gonna get eliminated soon.

20:05.821 --> 20:09.890
I see. Well, they're both hot.
Right, Sasha? That is your type.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.862
Sí. Muy caliente.

20:13.528 --> 20:16.132
I told Tim that you went out
with that Cuban girl recently.

20:16.232 --> 20:17.331
Yeah.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.771
I mean, I don't... I don't even
remember how it came up.

20:21.871 --> 20:25.341
Yeah, we were talking about people
who were living at home with their parents.

20:25.441 --> 20:27.310
- Oh, yeah. And I may have told Tim...
- Yeah.

20:27.410 --> 20:30.711
...that you went out with, like,
three girls recently that live at home.

20:33.249 --> 20:35.885
Wow. You told Tim a lot about me.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.021
I'm sorry. Was that a secret?

20:38.643 --> 20:41.255
It's fine. Totally.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.132
- Sasha.
- Yeah?

20:49.232 --> 20:53.267
I just wanna make sure that
you can drive home safely.

20:55.737 --> 20:58.506
Oh. I'm sorry. Is Tim staying over?

21:02.144 --> 21:04.581
Honestly, I don't... I mean,
whatever you wanna do.

21:04.681 --> 21:08.585
- I don't... I'm... I don't wanna...
- I don't have to work that early.

21:08.685 --> 21:12.453
Oh. Yeah. I... I don't
wanna assume anything.

21:21.296 --> 21:24.634
Hey. I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to use the copier at work.

21:24.934 --> 21:26.869
I don't think you've ever
stayed late at work.

21:26.969 --> 21:29.672
I didn't do it for the company.
I did it for the copier.

21:29.772 --> 21:33.710
I'm making a little something for Paige.
She won her first big case at work today.

21:33.810 --> 21:36.112
- Oh, yea! Good for her!
- That's awesome.

21:36.212 --> 21:39.916
Some factory was dumping sludge
near a school, and she had it shut down.

21:40.016 --> 21:43.319
- Oh, fuck that factory.
- God, Paige makes me feel like such a bad person.

21:43.519 --> 21:46.389
I know. Isn't she so like
annoying Erin Brockovich?

21:46.589 --> 21:48.858
"These are my boobs, Ed."

21:48.958 --> 21:50.893
- That's not the quote.
- Yes, it is. I'm pretty sure it is.

21:50.993 --> 21:52.528
- I'm pretty sure it's not the quote.
- It is so.

21:52.628 --> 21:56.899
Well, anyway, I found a life-size
cardboard Julia Roberts on eBay,

21:56.999 --> 22:00.503
and I'm gonna glue Paige's face on it and
throw her a little surprise party tomorrow.

22:00.603 --> 22:02.505
- Are you guys free?
- Totally.

22:02.605 --> 22:04.574
Actually, I was supposed
to have a date with this girl

22:04.674 --> 22:08.070
who's been writing me online like
every single day, but then she...

22:08.170 --> 22:11.848
she just told me she got back together with
her ex-girlfriend, so that's awesome.

22:11.948 --> 22:14.882
It's like... Yes, I'm free. I'm free.

22:15.617 --> 22:19.021
Great. Okay. So, 8:00 at my place?

22:19.121 --> 22:23.526
Hey, Sasha. That chick with the
purple dick is totally checking you out.

22:23.726 --> 22:26.162
You should go sword fight her.

22:28.032 --> 22:30.300
I think I need like five more
drinks before I do that.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.502
Jen, I think we have a drink. Do we not?

22:32.602 --> 22:36.406
- Here you go.
- Here we go. Kick it down. Drink it.

22:36.806 --> 22:38.975
I just found that, by the way.

22:39.675 --> 22:41.611
- She didn't, I swear.
- Now, go sword fight.

22:41.811 --> 22:44.781
- Will you please stop saying "sword fight"?
- Only when you sword fight her.

22:44.881 --> 22:47.250
- Sword fight! Sword fight! Sword fight!
- All right.

22:47.350 --> 22:50.386
If either of you put this on YouTube,
you're dead to me.

22:50.486 --> 22:53.854
- I accept this duel.
- Yeah!

23:14.342 --> 23:17.313
Oh, shit. It's 1:00.

23:17.713 --> 23:19.569
I gotta go walk my dog.

23:22.985 --> 23:27.289
I know that I was drunk last night,
but I don't remember seeing a dog.

23:27.984 --> 23:31.459
No. He lives with my ex.
She and I just share custody.

23:35.931 --> 23:39.802
- Do I hear someone in your house?
- Oh. Yeah. My mom just got home.

23:39.902 --> 23:42.371
- Hi, Mama!
- Hi, sweetheart!

23:42.471 --> 23:44.840
Oh, I thought this was your house.

23:45.172 --> 23:48.208
I wish. I'm still in school.

24:06.362 --> 24:09.665
Please tell me that you are not early,
because I'm so not ready yet.

24:09.765 --> 24:14.735
Actually... Don't kill me,
but can we reschedule Top Model night?

24:15.670 --> 24:18.112
Tim just surprised me.
He wants to take me out to dinner

24:18.212 --> 24:21.809
to celebrate me winning the case.
He even sent a car to pick me up.

24:23.535 --> 24:27.984
I know. I'm sure he saw it in a movie,
but I don't even care. How sweet is he?

24:28.384 --> 24:30.586
Yeah, that's really cute.

24:30.686 --> 24:33.322
I know. But I feel so bad
for bailing on you.

24:33.422 --> 24:36.926
No. Oh, my God. No, don't.
That... Don't be silly.

24:37.026 --> 24:39.495
That... That's what DVR is for.

24:39.595 --> 24:43.564
- Okay, thank you so much. I love you.
- I love you.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.684
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:01.784 --> 25:05.922
Sorry. How creepy was that that I sent
a car for you and I wasn't in it?

25:06.022 --> 25:09.258
I just... I had to work late. Wanted you to
be able to celebrate and not have to drive.

25:09.558 --> 25:12.462
- I can't believe you did that.
- Oh. Well, thank you.

25:12.562 --> 25:14.797
- The place looks amazing.
- Oh, yeah. It's cool, right?

25:14.897 --> 25:18.300
I guess they do this
whole local organic thing.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.537
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll put our names in.
- Okay. Good.

25:21.637 --> 25:24.440
- We have a reservation, but...
- What?

25:25.240 --> 25:26.591
Why are you freaking out?

25:28.043 --> 25:29.812
Usually with guys
I have to do everything.

25:29.912 --> 25:33.215
I have to pick the restaurant,
make the reservation,

25:33.315 --> 25:35.485
pick everybody up, order the wine.

25:35.585 --> 25:38.285
I wonder why those relationships
didn't last. Geez.

25:39.654 --> 25:40.721
Your table's ready.

25:41.823 --> 25:44.191
Okay, thanks. Come on.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.632
Is this too Ellen Page?

25:49.732 --> 25:52.735
No. But it is the boys' section.

25:52.835 --> 25:56.706
I wish Tim would wear stuff like this.
It would look so cute on him.

25:57.180 --> 25:58.941
Guess he just likes message tees.

25:59.041 --> 26:03.079
Did I tell you about his shirt that says
"Pizza Slut" in the Pizza Hut logo?

26:03.179 --> 26:05.047
Did you see this? This is so you.

26:05.147 --> 26:08.284
Oh, it's cute, but can you really
wear a jumper after 30?

26:08.384 --> 26:11.153
What are you talking about?
We're not even 29.

26:11.253 --> 26:13.756
Yeah, but we're both about to be.

26:13.856 --> 26:16.559
I don't think there's a cutoff
for jumpers, dude.

26:16.659 --> 26:18.594
Okay, I just think
there is for some clothes.

26:18.694 --> 26:21.964
You know when you see an older woman
and she's wearing striped knee socks

26:22.064 --> 26:25.601
and carrying a backpack
and still dyeing her hair red?

26:25.701 --> 26:29.305
She just seems, like, sad,
like she's a sad person.

26:29.405 --> 26:31.574
Yeah, well, I still don't think
there's a cutoff for jumpers.

26:31.674 --> 26:34.541
Picture a 55-year-old wearing a jumper.

26:35.110 --> 26:38.314
Okay. I'll give you that. That is sad.

26:38.414 --> 26:40.614
My cutoff is 54.

26:48.351 --> 26:51.160
- I mean...
- Where's the money, Lebowski?

26:51.260 --> 26:54.228
- So good.
- I want that money, Lebowski.

26:59.662 --> 27:01.070
You don't have to pause it.

27:01.170 --> 27:03.339
No, no, no. I don't
want you to miss anything.

27:03.439 --> 27:05.205
Okay.

27:31.132 --> 27:34.103
- Missed it.
- Sasha is with this girl.

27:34.203 --> 27:36.072
Okay. That's... That's...

27:36.172 --> 27:37.885
She's going back to her house.

27:37.985 --> 27:39.848
- It's so funny.
- It's so good.

27:39.948 --> 27:43.000
- This chick is really cute.
- How do you know?

27:43.100 --> 27:45.879
She send a picture. You wanna see it?

27:48.016 --> 27:49.385
You guys do that a lot.

27:50.070 --> 27:51.253
Is it annoying?

27:51.453 --> 27:54.657
No, but this is my favorite movie,

27:54.757 --> 27:57.727
and I did watch the movie about the
blind girl riding horses... for you.

27:57.827 --> 28:00.997
Wild Hearts Can't be
Broken is a classic.

28:02.692 --> 28:03.799
Yeah.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.837
Okay. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna turn it off, okay?

28:07.937 --> 28:09.372
No, no, no, no.
You don't have to turn it off.

28:09.472 --> 28:13.073
No, no, no, no. No. No. No.
I'm turning it off. I turned it off.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.779
- In the drawer.
- Fine.

28:16.879 --> 28:19.715
- What do you think about that?
- Fine. Still not off, but fine.

28:19.815 --> 28:23.086
- I'll take it. I'll take it. I'll take it.
- It's in the drawer.

28:23.586 --> 28:27.823
I mean, just because my car technically hit
his car does not mean that it's my fault.

28:27.923 --> 28:31.694
No. He was blocking your driveway.
That's your house.

28:31.794 --> 28:34.130
Yeah, what am I supposed to do,
not leave my home?

28:34.230 --> 28:37.500
Ridiculous.
I... I think you should appeal it.

28:37.600 --> 28:40.569
You're right. I should. It's like
a matter of principle at this point.

28:40.669 --> 28:43.172
Absolutely. Do not pay that asshole.

28:43.272 --> 28:45.888
You're right. I won't. Fuck that guy.

28:45.988 --> 28:49.211
Fuck him. I'll have the
chicken salad on the croissant.

28:49.311 --> 28:51.647
Hi. I'll have the ham and Gruyère on rye,
please. Thank you.

28:51.747 --> 28:53.549
Oh, yum. That looks good.

28:53.649 --> 28:56.485
How are things with Tim?
How's that going?

28:56.585 --> 28:59.746
Really good. Couple of
months in, no obvious flaws.

28:59.846 --> 29:01.522
I mean, there's one, but it's dumb.

29:02.257 --> 29:05.528
- What is that?
- Well, he's not the sharpest dresser.

29:05.628 --> 29:09.598
I mean, he's not terrible. He's just a
little clueless. Like, he still wears Tevas.

29:09.698 --> 29:14.771
Oh, my God. Let's stop by Nordstrom's
after this. They have a great shoe department.

29:14.871 --> 29:17.840
Mom, it's just "Nordstrom,"
not "Nordstrom's."

29:17.940 --> 29:20.902
And don't you think it's, like,
a little weird to be buying him clothes

29:21.002 --> 29:23.479
this early into a relationship?

29:23.579 --> 29:29.218
No. It's never too early to start
giving men fashion advice. They need it.

29:29.518 --> 29:31.053
- We'll go to Nordstrom's.
- "Strom."

29:31.153 --> 29:32.722
"Strom."

29:32.822 --> 29:36.625
We'll buy him something nice.
And when he wears it,

29:36.725 --> 29:42.029
you have to be sure to
incentivize him to keep wearing it.

29:44.232 --> 29:47.203
- Oh, my God. That's disgusting.
- Well, I'm just saying.

29:47.303 --> 29:50.773
It's how I got your father to stop
wearing those Disney sweatshirts.

29:50.873 --> 29:54.374
- Are you paying together or separate?
- Separate.

29:58.379 --> 30:02.818
Oh, my God. Thank you so much, Mom.
I can't believe I owe so much money.

30:02.918 --> 30:06.355
I must have checked the wrong
box or something on the W-2.

30:06.455 --> 30:08.257
Those forms are so confusing.

30:08.357 --> 30:11.260
Don't worry about it, honey.
Dad and I will take care of it online.

30:11.360 --> 30:12.628
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

30:12.728 --> 30:16.532
Oh, my God, I feel so bad. You guys already
help me out so much with rent and...

30:16.632 --> 30:18.801
Honey, you know,
it's an investment, right?

30:18.901 --> 30:22.102
It's all gonna pay off
when you get that big record deal.

30:23.772 --> 30:26.041
I'll never forget when you won
that prize at graduation.

30:26.141 --> 30:29.678
Your professor told me your daughter's
gonna be the next Patti Smith.

30:29.778 --> 30:33.082
- How's the album coming along?
- It's good.

30:33.382 --> 30:34.850
Yeah, I was gonna work on it tonight.

30:35.150 --> 30:36.418
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:36.518 --> 30:40.156
I can't wait for the day I'm in a Starbucks
and see your face on one of those CDs.

30:40.256 --> 30:44.293
I'll get to tell the clerk, "That's my
daughter, and I'll take a chai latte."

30:44.393 --> 30:48.197
Or maybe you don't want Starbucks to sell
your stuff. Is that too corporate? Right?

30:48.297 --> 30:52.599
No, no, no. No.
Gr... That's... Starbucks is great.

30:56.571 --> 30:58.774
Oh, my God.

30:58.874 --> 31:01.844
You need to do that more. I'm serious.

31:01.944 --> 31:05.214
I don't know what got into me.
You just looked so hot in that shirt

31:05.314 --> 31:07.849
that it brought out my wild side.

31:07.949 --> 31:10.717
Note to self, buy more plaid.

31:13.054 --> 31:15.591
What are you gonna do
this weekend without me?

31:16.182 --> 31:17.860
I'm gonna cry.

31:18.949 --> 31:23.633
- Then I'm gonna visit my dad.
- Oh. That's sweet. I wanna meet him.

31:23.733 --> 31:26.550
You will meet him. I'm gonna
throw him a party for his 80th.

31:28.237 --> 31:30.439
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

31:30.539 --> 31:32.708
My dad's fucking old. It's funny.

31:32.808 --> 31:35.578
He was a, dirty old man
who slept with his secretary.

31:35.678 --> 31:39.880
My mom's a slutty secretary who slept
with her boss. It's totally funny.

31:42.016 --> 31:44.453
It must be hard taking care of your dad.

31:45.836 --> 31:49.925
I don't know. I mean, we all end up taking
care of our parents at some point, right?

31:50.025 --> 31:51.994
I just got a head start.

31:52.964 --> 31:57.630
I feel like my mom is trying to
train me to start taking care of her.

31:58.367 --> 32:03.505
She used to pay every time we went out
to eat, and then she just stopped.

32:04.005 --> 32:07.710
It's not like I can't afford a $10 sandwich.
But it just feels like she's saying...

32:07.810 --> 32:09.645
- "I'm done with this mom shit"?
- Yeah.

32:09.745 --> 32:11.913
- Yeah.
- It's sad.

32:12.213 --> 32:15.482
I feel like no one's
taking care of me anymore.

32:17.419 --> 32:19.855
Other people can take care of you.

32:20.969 --> 32:23.689
- Oh, it's Sasha.
- No.

32:23.789 --> 32:26.095
- I don't wanna go.
- No.

32:26.195 --> 32:28.797
Okay, I have to go.
She's gonna be so mad at me.

32:28.897 --> 32:30.480
No.

32:32.234 --> 32:35.537
Okay. Do I look like I just had sex?

32:37.411 --> 32:38.695
All right.

32:38.973 --> 32:41.875
I will call you when I get
to the hotel. I love you.

32:42.877 --> 32:44.444
I mean...

32:45.880 --> 32:49.051
I knew it. I knew you loved me.

32:49.151 --> 32:51.687
- I didn't mean for it to come out like that.
- I knew you loved me.

32:51.787 --> 32:53.255
- So you didn't mean it?
- No.

32:53.355 --> 32:54.690
- So you love me?
- I...

32:54.790 --> 32:57.159
So you don't love me? You love me.

32:57.259 --> 32:58.594
- You love me.
- I meant...

32:58.694 --> 33:02.064
- You love me.
- I... You love me.

33:02.364 --> 33:04.905
I don't know. Give me a kiss.
Let me see.

33:09.107 --> 33:10.218
- I love you.
- No.

33:10.318 --> 33:12.873
- I do. Yeah.
- All right.

33:15.109 --> 33:18.180
What time is it?
I feel like the pool closes at 10:00.

33:18.280 --> 33:20.583
Oh, my God.
I don't think anyone's enforcing that.

33:20.683 --> 33:23.251
This place doesn't even have a staff.

33:23.582 --> 33:26.655
God, I could have taken you
to a nicer place for your birthday.

33:26.755 --> 33:31.960
What? Are you crazy? This is perfect.
I love how it's right off the freeway.

33:32.060 --> 33:35.564
No, I'm serious. Every time I drive by
this place, I wonder who the fuck stays here.

33:35.664 --> 33:37.697
Well, now we know. Truckers and us.

33:39.533 --> 33:43.739
I can't believe this is my last birthday
in my 20s. We were just 25.

33:44.039 --> 33:45.739
I know. It's crazy.

33:48.409 --> 33:50.846
I'm a 29-year-old receptionist.

33:51.046 --> 33:55.004
But you're not a real receptionist.
You're a musician.

33:55.104 --> 33:57.259
I know. But...

33:57.359 --> 34:02.225
being a receptionist is the only thing that
anyone's paying me to do right now. Like...

34:03.225 --> 34:06.162
I don't know. If I died tomorrow,
my obituary would say,

34:06.262 --> 34:10.429
"Sasha Weiss, 29, a receptionist,
was killed today."

34:11.666 --> 34:14.103
- Why would you be killed?
- Because... I don't know. I'm 29.

34:14.203 --> 34:16.570
Something really fucking sudden
must have happened.

34:18.106 --> 34:21.043
God, I've been feeling old lately too.

34:21.143 --> 34:22.978
I feel like there are
certain things I can't do anymore,

34:23.078 --> 34:26.888
- like sit on the floor at airports.
- I still do that.

34:26.987 --> 34:29.772
Oh, I still do it. I just feel like
everybody's looking at me, like,

34:29.871 --> 34:32.754
"That woman is too old
to be sitting on the floor."

34:32.853 --> 34:35.755
Yeah. Growing up sucks.

34:36.389 --> 34:39.840
- No, it doesn't.
- What? Don't you wish you were 21?

34:39.940 --> 34:42.929
God, no. I was so insecure.

34:43.764 --> 34:45.333
But...

34:46.234 --> 34:48.475
when you're 21, it's...

34:48.574 --> 34:50.369
just easier.

34:50.838 --> 34:52.385
Right?

34:52.940 --> 34:58.680
It's okay to be a receptionist and eat
like shit and just date people for fun...

34:58.780 --> 35:00.995
and sit on the floor.

35:03.384 --> 35:06.789
And remember, you and I
used to hang out all the time.

35:06.889 --> 35:10.724
And we'd make stupid videos
that no one thought was funny but us.

35:12.293 --> 35:13.460
Sasha.

35:14.462 --> 35:16.998
- Sasha, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

35:17.098 --> 35:20.369
- Ignore me. Don't.
- No. Please, tell me.

35:20.469 --> 35:22.502
Nothing. I just...

35:25.106 --> 35:27.240
I miss that sometimes.

35:28.509 --> 35:31.880
But what's changed? I'm still here.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.450
I'm not going anywhere.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.653
We're still the only ones
who think we're funny.

35:38.853 --> 35:41.791
- Shut up.
- Come here.

35:42.391 --> 35:45.725
- I love you.
- I love you.

35:47.495 --> 35:50.398
Oh, my God! You're a genius!

35:51.678 --> 35:53.743
Yes. Fitz stickers.

35:53.843 --> 35:57.324
- I knew you'd love it, you fucking loser.
- We're playing right now.

35:57.424 --> 36:00.042
Duh. Do you know how long I've been
looking forward to this trip?

36:00.142 --> 36:01.077
Oh, really?

36:01.609 --> 36:04.913
Yes. Do you think Tim
would play Girl Talk with me?

36:05.013 --> 36:08.339
He can't even be in the room
when I watch Real Housewives.

36:08.739 --> 36:12.120
I know. I have to binge on
this shit when I'm with you.

36:12.220 --> 36:15.424
Oh, my God. I can't believe I forgot.
I brought pink wine.

36:15.524 --> 36:17.192
- No!
- I did.

36:17.292 --> 36:21.240
Oh, my God. Do we have a wine opener?

36:21.340 --> 36:24.197
No, darling. It's a twist-off.

36:26.402 --> 36:29.404
Oh, my God. Girl Talk. Drunk Girl Talk.

36:29.504 --> 36:31.540
Drunk Talk.

36:31.640 --> 36:33.906
- Girl Drunk.
- It's so bad.

36:35.410 --> 36:37.079
Tim's calling you.

36:37.615 --> 36:41.414
How dare you call me during
Sasha's birthday. Ignore you.

36:46.688 --> 36:49.823
"Go find a clue to your
future career choice."

36:53.462 --> 36:56.295
"On the sixth page of the Yellow Pages."

36:57.631 --> 36:58.567
What?

36:58.967 --> 37:04.037
A pipe burst at Tim's dad's retirement home.
He has to take him to a hotel.

37:05.848 --> 37:09.811
- I really feel like I should call him.
- Yeah. Call him.

37:10.111 --> 37:12.815
It's okay. Go. Go. Call him.

37:12.915 --> 37:15.381
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

38:49.511 --> 38:51.913
Down day for investors on Wall Street.

38:52.013 --> 38:55.014
The Dow Jones Industrial Average
fell one and a half percent.

38:56.918 --> 38:57.991
Hey!

38:58.491 --> 39:01.035
I was gonna take that spot.

39:01.455 --> 39:04.293
I didn't see the name
"Bitch" written on it.

39:04.393 --> 39:06.716
- Get out of there!
- No!

39:15.769 --> 39:17.336
Seriously.

39:18.639 --> 39:21.076
Okay, so you know that girl
I told you about? I met her last week.

39:21.176 --> 39:24.813
And she's the one whose roommate might
or might not be her ex. Who knows?

39:24.913 --> 39:28.550
Okay, well, I texted her as soon as
I met her and then never heard back.

39:28.650 --> 39:32.654
And then I just got a text just now saying,
"See you tonight at 8:00."

39:32.754 --> 39:36.325
Is she texting the wrong person,
or am I supposed to be at some event at 8:00?

39:36.425 --> 39:38.260
I don't know. Ask her.

39:38.360 --> 39:42.130
Well, no, I can't ask her. Because
what if she texted the wrong person?

39:42.230 --> 39:44.032
And then I'm just asking
if she's inviting me out,

39:44.132 --> 39:46.478
and then she's gonna
have to re-blow me off.

39:46.578 --> 39:47.720
Then don't text her.

39:48.302 --> 39:50.339
No, but if she did mean to text me

39:50.439 --> 39:53.208
and if she was just, you know,
playing it cool this whole week

39:53.308 --> 39:55.978
and then she's expecting to see me
and then I don't show up,

39:56.078 --> 39:59.412
- then I'm blowing her off.
- I don't know, Sasha.

40:02.350 --> 40:05.254
I'm sorry. Too mature for this now
that you have a boyfriend

40:05.354 --> 40:08.321
and you spend the whole weekend
roasting a chicken together?

40:09.256 --> 40:10.726
How do you know that?

40:10.826 --> 40:14.794
You posted it on Instagram.
I'm just giving you shit.

40:15.729 --> 40:17.299
- Let me see that text.
- No.

40:17.399 --> 40:19.268
- No, no, show it to me. I wanna know.
- It's fine. No.

40:19.368 --> 40:21.236
Well, maybe if I see it,
I can figure out what she meant.

40:21.336 --> 40:24.270
It's fine. It's totally fine.

40:35.549 --> 40:37.216
All right.

40:38.085 --> 40:39.135
I mean...

40:39.235 --> 40:41.251
What? That's how it's supposed to look.

40:41.351 --> 40:42.926
Okay.

40:51.899 --> 40:53.966
What are you thinking about?

40:55.335 --> 40:58.271
- Nothing.
- What is it?

41:03.744 --> 41:06.312
All right, I gotta talk to you
about something.

41:08.782 --> 41:11.778
Don't freak out. But...

41:12.854 --> 41:15.423
I found something on my back
the other day.

41:16.023 --> 41:18.059
- What, like a mole?
- Yeah.

41:18.159 --> 41:20.362
But... But you're a dermatologist.

41:20.462 --> 41:25.133
I... Yeah, well, dermatologists
can also get skin cancer.

41:25.233 --> 41:27.269
- You have cancer?
- No, no, no. I don't know that.

41:27.369 --> 41:30.172
I don't know that. I'm waiting
on some results. I just want...

41:30.272 --> 41:31.943
Show me.

41:33.540 --> 41:35.176
I don't... It's gross. I don't want...

41:35.276 --> 41:38.147
Tim. I don't care. Whatever.
Tim, show me the mole.

41:38.247 --> 41:40.515
- Come on. Show it to me. Tim.
- I don't wanna show you.

41:40.615 --> 41:42.649
All right. It's near the top.

41:48.022 --> 41:50.259
Should I be worried?

41:50.759 --> 41:52.625
Yes.

41:53.527 --> 41:55.261
I mean no.

41:56.497 --> 41:58.031
I mean...

41:58.999 --> 42:00.427
Yes, I'll marry you.

42:00.527 --> 42:02.569
- Really?
- Yes.

42:04.427 --> 42:07.476
Oh, my God. How could you do that to me?
You fucking asshole.

42:07.576 --> 42:09.878
I wanted us to have a good story.
Don't you want a good story?

42:09.978 --> 42:13.548
- Fuck you. Who wrote that on your back?
- Dr. Schaffer.

42:13.648 --> 42:16.318
- With his little lady hands?
- Those are the ones.

42:17.161 --> 42:20.755
Oh, my God. Tim.

42:20.855 --> 42:22.357
Now that you've said yes...

42:23.274 --> 42:26.325
Let me tell you, you did such
a shitty job with that tent.

42:43.711 --> 42:45.180
Hey!

42:45.280 --> 42:47.313
You wanna hear something fucked-up?

42:48.148 --> 42:50.118
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

42:50.218 --> 42:54.423
They did peer reviews at my work today.
Everyone hates me. Listen to this.

42:54.523 --> 42:57.759
- "Sasha is bright and skilled"...
- That sounds like a compliment.

42:57.859 --> 43:02.597
"But this ability does not seem to be focused
on her work here at Grossman Properties."

43:02.697 --> 43:04.833
I bet you anything Valerie wrote that.

43:04.933 --> 43:07.736
That bitch is always walking by my desk
asking if I'm "having a busy day"

43:07.836 --> 43:10.472
when it's obvious she doesn't think
that I look busy, 'cause I'm not.

43:10.572 --> 43:12.741
Okay, don't focus on
who wrote what. Just...

43:12.841 --> 43:16.978
Are you crazy? I have to know who
wrote what. Like, who the fuck wrote this?

43:17.078 --> 43:21.883
"Sasha can come across as irritated when
asked to do something." Who are you?

43:21.983 --> 43:25.053
Can I get a vodka soda with
a splash of cranberry, please?

43:25.153 --> 43:27.489
You need to remember
that this is just your day job.

43:27.589 --> 43:30.091
I know that it sucks and it's boring,
but this is what you wanted.

43:30.191 --> 43:32.794
You wanted something easy and mindless
that you didn't have to think about

43:32.894 --> 43:34.930
so you could focus
on your music every night.

43:35.830 --> 43:38.298
Yeah. No.

43:38.440 --> 43:39.866
I know you're right.

43:42.771 --> 43:44.239
How was your camping trip?

43:45.693 --> 43:49.710
It... it was really good.
It was... great, actually.

43:50.462 --> 43:52.511
Tim and I got engaged.

43:53.514 --> 43:56.115
- Wait. What?
- Yeah.

43:57.651 --> 44:01.120
Paige! Oh, my God!

44:03.090 --> 44:05.024
Oh, my God.

44:06.626 --> 44:08.563
Wow.

44:08.963 --> 44:12.334
I know. Can you believe it?

44:12.434 --> 44:13.902
- Well, cheers.
- Wedding.

44:14.002 --> 44:16.771
- Yeah! Oh, my God!
- I know. It's so crazy, right?

44:16.871 --> 44:19.605
- I'm gonna be your best man.
- You...

45:24.404 --> 45:26.541
So, you come here often?

45:27.082 --> 45:30.979
Yeah. Me and the mozzarella sticks
have a little thing going on.

45:31.079 --> 45:34.582
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but they're kind of seeing somebody else.

45:34.682 --> 45:37.917
- I feel so betrayed.
- We didn't want you to find out like this.

45:41.722 --> 45:45.294
One time I had two orders of these.
In one night.

45:45.994 --> 45:49.397
No, I had one in the parking lot
and then I drove through again.

45:49.497 --> 45:50.732
I'd be too embarrassed.

45:50.832 --> 45:54.934
Yeah, I couldn't really bring myself to
make eye contact with the girl at the window.

46:07.180 --> 46:09.884
- What band is this?
- Oh, this is my friend Kaya's band.

46:09.984 --> 46:11.553
They're amazing.

46:11.953 --> 46:14.289
- I'll bring you a copy.
- Okay.

46:15.350 --> 46:17.559
I'm actually playing
the drums on the CD.

46:17.659 --> 46:20.729
Oh, no way. Wow.
I didn't know you played.

46:21.197 --> 46:23.498
I am a musician too.

46:23.798 --> 46:25.667
Well, I'm not really a musician.

46:25.767 --> 46:29.037
I'm mostly a writer,
and I've been drawing a lot lately.

46:29.137 --> 46:32.366
I'm actually working on a graphic novel.

46:33.674 --> 46:35.810
So are you, like, in a band?

46:35.910 --> 46:38.178
No, not right now. I'm just...

46:38.278 --> 46:42.244
working on writing some
songs of my own first.

46:42.344 --> 46:45.818
I hate it when bands go
on tour with, like, three songs.

46:46.654 --> 46:49.257
Well, it is nice to meet
a fellow artist.

46:49.357 --> 46:51.726
Yeah. I know. You too.

46:51.826 --> 46:54.896
I had no idea.
Jenn never mentioned anything.

46:55.296 --> 46:58.199
Well, Jenn doesn't know
everything about me.

46:58.299 --> 47:00.666
We didn't really date for that long.

47:13.614 --> 47:14.517
Hey, Sasha.

47:16.818 --> 47:19.320
- You bitch. That hurt.
- Better be careful.

47:19.924 --> 47:22.323
It's your turn.
We're paying by the hour.

47:22.623 --> 47:23.956
Hey.

47:38.071 --> 47:41.209
That's a really interesting tattoo
that you have. What does it mean?

47:41.309 --> 47:43.445
I don't really like to talk about it.

47:43.545 --> 47:47.649
Oh. I just figured,
since it was on your neck...

47:48.449 --> 47:51.052
So, how long have you and Sasha
been seeing each other?

47:51.252 --> 47:54.088
Well, technically three weeks,
but don't tell anyone that.

47:54.188 --> 47:55.857
We don't want anyone to know yet.

47:56.603 --> 47:59.794
- Why?
- Just dumb lesbian drama.

47:59.894 --> 48:01.462
Jenn two N's dated Vanessa.

48:01.662 --> 48:05.133
- For, like, a second.
- Yeah, but she would freak out anyway.

48:05.233 --> 48:08.336
But we have a plan.
I just deleted Sasha on Facebook.

48:08.436 --> 48:11.272
Yeah, we're gonna pretend like we
don't really know each other right now.

48:11.372 --> 48:12.974
And then right when
we're ready to tell people,

48:13.074 --> 48:15.710
we're gonna add each other back and
comment on each other's pages like,

48:15.810 --> 48:18.644
- oh, we just ran into each other.
- I gotcha.

48:27.020 --> 48:29.591
There are some nice houses
around here though.

48:29.791 --> 48:32.811
Yeah, but I don't know.
Do you think the neighborhood's too sketchy?

48:32.911 --> 48:34.929
You think this neighborhood is sketchy?

48:35.529 --> 48:39.832
Well... I mean, yeah. There's, like,
three metal detectors in this bowling alley.

48:40.700 --> 48:42.201
That's just the future.

48:42.836 --> 48:44.539
Well, yeah, probably.

48:44.639 --> 48:47.008
Yeah. The schools aren't
very good around here either.

48:47.339 --> 48:49.677
Oh, "the schools."

48:49.777 --> 48:51.946
Just thinking ahead.

48:52.046 --> 48:54.949
Well, whatever you decide,
don't send your kids to private school,

48:55.049 --> 48:57.802
unless you want them to grow up
with a silver spoon up their ass.

48:57.902 --> 48:59.871
Well, what if you live in a really
dangerous neighborhood?

48:59.971 --> 49:02.292
I don't care.
I'd still rather send my kids

49:02.392 --> 49:04.776
to a public school in the ghetto
than a private school.

49:04.876 --> 49:08.346
All kids that go to private school
turn into conservative douche bags.

49:08.446 --> 49:10.268
Tim went to private school.

49:11.414 --> 49:12.450
I did.

49:13.978 --> 49:15.851
We gotta go. My dad's locking the gate.

49:18.555 --> 49:22.558
She just had to move back home for a few
months before art school. It's temporary.

49:24.361 --> 49:25.928
Bye.

49:27.331 --> 49:29.943
What the fuck is wrong with that girl?
I'm sorry. I know you like everyone,

49:30.043 --> 49:31.736
and you think that I'm really judgy,
but can you please...

49:31.836 --> 49:33.838
- I hated Vanessa.
- Thank you.

49:33.938 --> 49:36.707
I'm so sick of Sasha
wasting her time with these idiots.

49:36.807 --> 49:39.586
- When is she gonna date an actual adult?
- Is everyone she dates that immature?

49:39.686 --> 49:42.330
- Vanessa's on the mature side.
- Gotcha.

49:42.430 --> 49:46.417
Can you not say "gotcha"? I'm sorry. It's a pet
peeve of mine. You kind of say it a lot.

49:46.517 --> 49:47.687
Okay. Sure. Sorry.

49:47.787 --> 49:50.523
What am I gonna say when she
asks me what I thought of her?

49:50.623 --> 49:53.792
Just tell her you thought she was
a fucking bitch. And, you know...

49:53.892 --> 49:56.161
What am I gonna say?
"I really liked her neck tattoo."

49:56.261 --> 49:58.997
No. You know, don't say anything.
I don't know why you have to get involved.

49:59.097 --> 50:01.448
Just say you're glad she's happy,
wait for it to burn out.

50:01.548 --> 50:04.334
- Which it most definitely will.
- It has to, right?

50:04.434 --> 50:07.108
- Yes. It will. So stay out of it.
- Yeah, I will.

50:07.208 --> 50:09.274
Oh, God, I just want to
sit Sasha down and be like,

50:09.374 --> 50:13.211
"The truth hurts, but as your best friend,
get your life together!

50:13.311 --> 50:16.481
You know, you have to stop going out
all night and dating girls like this

50:16.581 --> 50:18.683
and figure out what you
want to do with your life,

50:18.783 --> 50:20.852
because you're gonna wake up one day,
and you're gonna be 35,

50:20.952 --> 50:23.521
and you're gonna have no relationship,
you're gonna have no savings,

50:23.621 --> 50:26.391
all of your friends are gonna be married
with kids and be miles ahead of you,

50:26.491 --> 50:29.727
and it's gonna feel like shit,
and I'm sorry, but that's the reality."

50:29.827 --> 50:32.263
Yeah. That's not staying out of it.

50:32.363 --> 50:35.533
Well, obviously I'm not gonna
say any of that to her.

50:36.233 --> 50:39.930
You two are a really cute couple.
Vanessa seems, like,

50:40.030 --> 50:44.640
really confident and, like,
very sure of herself.

50:45.609 --> 50:47.311
Yeah, I like her a lot.

50:47.511 --> 50:50.181
That's great. I'm so happy for you.

50:50.581 --> 50:52.817
So, do you think it's gonna be serious?

50:52.917 --> 50:55.153
Could you, like,
see yourself ending up with Vanessa?

50:56.042 --> 51:00.224
I don't know. I mean,
it's going really well. Yeah. So...

51:00.424 --> 51:03.161
I mean, I know you don't know her,
but she's really cool.

51:03.261 --> 51:04.960
Oh, I'm sure she is.

51:06.963 --> 51:11.600
But, you know, you guys might be, like,
just too different to really get each other.

51:12.569 --> 51:13.971
What does that mean?

51:14.071 --> 51:16.741
I don't know. Sometimes just
really super creative types

51:16.841 --> 51:21.612
don't really mesh that well with people
who are more, you know, traditional.

51:21.712 --> 51:23.008
I'm traditional?

51:23.108 --> 51:27.452
No. No, no, no, no, no.
You're just more, you know, organized.

51:27.552 --> 51:30.665
Vanessa is like a total free spirit.

51:30.765 --> 51:32.757
You know? Sometimes I'll wake up
in the middle of the night,

51:32.857 --> 51:36.032
and she's up writing down a dream she
just had. And I've read a few of them.

51:36.632 --> 51:41.265
Oh, my God. Like, it's incredible.
They're complete stories.

51:41.365 --> 51:44.769
Like, that's just how her brain works.
She dreams in stories.

51:44.869 --> 51:48.673
So, does Vanessa want to be
a writer, like for work?

51:48.773 --> 51:51.108
'Cause she doesn't have
a job right now, right?

51:51.208 --> 51:54.012
Yeah, she's just taking some time
to figure out what she really wants to do,

51:54.112 --> 51:58.116
which I respect a lot more than
some people who just pick some path

51:58.216 --> 52:01.483
right out of school
because they need stability.

52:03.353 --> 52:07.091
- Oh, do you need to slow down?
- No. Do you?

52:07.191 --> 52:08.933
No. I'm fine.

52:09.033 --> 52:12.061
- I'm good too.
- Good. Good.

52:24.307 --> 52:27.478
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

52:28.335 --> 52:32.083
- Why can't you just pay for the damage?
- You were parked in our driveway.

52:32.183 --> 52:33.952
You hit my car. You hit my...

52:34.052 --> 52:37.422
- Okay, let's... Let's calm down a second.
- It's okay, Tim. I got it. You know what?

52:37.522 --> 52:40.358
The insurance companies are still trying
to determine who was at fault here.

52:40.458 --> 52:44.962
Okay, you know what?
I'm a nice guy, okay? I'm a fucking dad.

52:45.062 --> 52:48.833
I'm not... I'm not trying to rip you off here.
I just want what's right.

52:49.733 --> 52:52.003
I'm sorry that you feel wronged
in this situation.

52:52.103 --> 52:55.806
Okay, you're unbelievable. Don't run over my
kids next time you're texting and driving.

52:56.106 --> 52:58.342
- I do not text and drive.
- Seriously?

52:58.742 --> 53:01.579
Dude, she does it all the time.
I see her.

53:01.679 --> 53:04.415
You... You.

53:04.815 --> 53:06.588
Jesus!

53:07.317 --> 53:11.654
Maybe I was entering something
into my G.P.S. Maybe.

53:13.189 --> 53:14.256
Wait...

53:15.525 --> 53:16.995
- Hey.
- What's up?

53:17.095 --> 53:19.230
- Maybe we should just pay him.
- What?

53:19.330 --> 53:21.265
Well, we don't need to be in a fight
with our neighbor over this.

53:21.365 --> 53:23.563
Maybe we just give him a couple
hundred bucks, you say you're sorry,

53:23.663 --> 53:26.044
- we'll be done with it.
- But I didn't do anything wrong.

53:26.144 --> 53:29.748
I'm not saying you did. I mean, although
you're not really supposed to use the G.P.S.

53:29.848 --> 53:32.677
- while you're driving. But that's...
- Oh, so you do think it's my fault.

53:32.777 --> 53:34.512
I don't know whose fault it was.
I wasn't there.

53:34.612 --> 53:38.082
So, great. Good to know that
when in doubt, you're not on my team.

53:38.182 --> 53:39.107
Paige.

53:39.307 --> 53:42.082
Just go. You're gonna be late for golf.

53:44.187 --> 53:47.191
- You can't really be late for golf.
- Whatever. Just go.

53:47.391 --> 53:48.958
Okay.

54:06.720 --> 54:09.091
- That feels good.
- Yeah? You like that?

54:09.191 --> 54:11.582
- Yeah.
- It's my signature move.

54:11.682 --> 54:14.684
- "Signature move."
- Yeah.

54:21.157 --> 54:22.775
You and Vanessa?

54:22.975 --> 54:25.563
No. No. I...

54:25.663 --> 54:29.334
Not yet. Nothing happened yet.
We've just been talking about it.

54:29.934 --> 54:32.270
Good. You scared me.

54:32.370 --> 54:34.272
You think Jenn would really freak out?

54:34.372 --> 54:36.841
- Sasha, Jenn would die.
- Okay.

54:36.941 --> 54:41.176
Okay. Fine.
I won't hook up with her then.

54:45.916 --> 54:48.553
You know you can trust me
with this stuff, right?

54:49.053 --> 54:50.540
What do you mean?

54:50.640 --> 54:52.082
I mean, like,

54:52.182 --> 54:56.428
if something has already happened
between you and Vanessa,

54:57.528 --> 55:00.164
and you wanted to confide in me,
you totally can,

55:00.264 --> 55:03.098
and I promise I won't tell Jenn.

55:07.537 --> 55:10.506
I have been hooking up
with Vanessa for a little while.

55:12.409 --> 55:15.044
Okay. No judgment.

55:16.212 --> 55:17.281
Seriously?

55:17.381 --> 55:20.765
Come on. If lesbians weren't allowed to date
anyone their friends have already dated,

55:20.865 --> 55:24.011
- then we'd all be celibate.
- Oh, my God.

55:31.661 --> 55:35.738
- Hey, Jenn. I was just with other Jen.
- Fuck you.

55:36.038 --> 55:39.105
Really, Sasha? Vanessa?
After I cried for months on your shoulder

55:39.205 --> 55:40.903
about how badly she hurt me?

55:41.838 --> 55:44.709
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

55:45.409 --> 55:48.546
- You weren't supposed to find out like this.
- What? So now that Paige ditched you,

55:48.646 --> 55:51.782
you're just gonna fuck anyone over
so you don't have to be alone?

55:51.882 --> 55:53.199
Paige didn't ditch me.

55:53.299 --> 55:55.709
Oh, please. Wake up.
You've been replaced.

55:55.809 --> 55:58.622
And you know what? You deserve it,
because I have never been this betrayed.

55:58.722 --> 56:01.192
Oh, really, Jenn?
You've never been this betrayed?

56:01.292 --> 56:03.861
Even when two of your exes
started fucking each other?

56:03.961 --> 56:08.032
And, please, you're not some saint.
You slept with a married girl last year.

56:08.132 --> 56:11.958
Cameron was in an open relationship, okay?
You know what? This isn't about that.

56:12.058 --> 56:16.313
This is not about that.
This is about our friendship, which is over.

56:16.413 --> 56:18.225
So good-bye. Oh, and you know what?

56:18.325 --> 56:21.562
Vanessa doesn't shave her pussy hair
or even trim it, so good luck down there.

56:21.812 --> 56:24.279
Oh, well, guess what?
I already know that!

56:27.784 --> 56:28.917
I'm not even gonna...

56:30.186 --> 56:33.021
Oh, my God. Jen...

56:33.890 --> 56:37.793
- Sasha, what's up?
- You fucking told Jenn?

56:48.137 --> 56:49.772
- Hey.
- Hi.

57:04.988 --> 57:07.379
Look, I'm sorry about earlier, okay?

57:07.479 --> 57:10.726
I did not mean to take a side.
I don't know that guy.

57:11.194 --> 57:12.661
Thanks.

57:14.464 --> 57:16.500
- Don't be like that.
- Like what?

57:16.600 --> 57:18.603
- "Thanks."
- I didn't say it like that.

57:18.703 --> 57:20.969
Okay. Never mind.

57:26.943 --> 57:28.546
Enough!

57:29.346 --> 57:31.549
- I miss you, okay?
- Okay.

57:31.649 --> 57:34.383
Golfing was great. Thank you for asking.

57:49.632 --> 57:52.601
You're a fucking bitch.

57:54.471 --> 57:58.075
Nora, hi. I'm sorry that
you heard that. I was on...

57:58.175 --> 58:01.880
I was researching our properties,
and someone said something...

58:01.980 --> 58:05.015
This package needs to go out
to our China office immediately.

58:05.115 --> 58:08.684
Right. Okay. I'm sorry. Okay.

58:18.127 --> 58:19.528
Hey.

58:20.630 --> 58:21.661
Hey.

58:21.761 --> 58:24.208
Look what I found
in the conference room.

58:24.308 --> 58:26.370
- Hi.
- Hey.

58:26.470 --> 58:29.647
- Is it already 6:00?
- Have you been here all day?

58:29.747 --> 58:33.110
Yeah. I just got totally absorbed
in my short story.

58:33.210 --> 58:34.496
Pete stopped by to give me his notes,

58:34.596 --> 58:37.492
and they just sent me
in this whole new direction.

58:38.983 --> 58:42.529
And Pete is the guy that you met in the
coffee shop, right? The writer guy?

58:42.629 --> 58:46.490
Yeah, yeah. And he teaches
part-time at the university.

58:46.590 --> 58:50.628
They gave him this amazing
fellowship that, like, no one gets.

58:50.728 --> 58:54.698
He has all these ins at The New Yorker, so he's
gonna help me submit this once it's done.

58:54.798 --> 58:56.601
Cool.

58:56.901 --> 58:59.403
Oh. Were you having wine?

58:59.503 --> 59:03.774
Oh, yeah. Actually, it's... it's gone.
Pete just brought some earlier.

59:03.874 --> 59:06.341
Oh. I thought it was a work meeting.

59:07.544 --> 59:11.315
It was, at first,
but then we hung out, and...

59:11.615 --> 59:14.618
I don't know. I guess I hadn't
told him that I was gay or something.

59:14.718 --> 59:18.520
People don't normally assume I am,
because I'm really feminine.

59:19.656 --> 59:20.548
But...

59:21.325 --> 59:26.063
at one point, he... kissed me.

59:26.363 --> 59:30.901
What? Oh, my God. Awkward!

59:31.826 --> 59:34.403
Yeah. That's what I would have thought.

59:36.172 --> 59:41.176
I don't know how to tell you this, but...
there was something there.

59:42.979 --> 59:44.346
But...

59:46.382 --> 59:47.549
you're gay.

59:49.118 --> 59:52.890
I mean, I don't know.

59:53.090 --> 59:56.306
I don't know. I feel like I've been saying
I'm gay for so long that maybe

59:56.406 --> 01:00:01.498
I just stopped getting in touch with where
I actually am, you know, in the spectrum.

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:05.601
All I know is I owe it
to myself to find out.

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.374
Okay. Got it.

01:00:10.474 --> 01:00:13.608
And I owe it to you to be honest.

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:16.614
Not that I could have lied.

01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:20.716
I'm just one of those people
who's not capable of a false moment.

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:41.071
All right. I got a cake mix, I got
a bottle of scotch, I got a face mask

01:00:41.171 --> 01:00:44.975
and a really weird
jewelry-making kit that I found at CVS.

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:46.910
So what are we doing first?

01:00:48.878 --> 01:00:51.148
You think two N's will ever forgive me?

01:00:51.248 --> 01:00:55.385
Yeah. I mean, she'll probably hold
a grudge 'cause she loves drama.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:57.087
Yeah, but so does one "N,"

01:00:57.187 --> 01:01:00.090
even though she keeps saying
she doesn't want to get in between us.

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:03.694
As soon as two N's gets a girlfriend,
she's gonna forget all about this.

01:01:03.794 --> 01:01:06.005
She was so mad.

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:09.600
You know, maybe I should
remember next time that...

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.536
if it starts off with a ton of drama,

01:01:12.636 --> 01:01:14.371
maybe I shouldn't go there.

01:01:14.471 --> 01:01:17.207
That's probably a good rule of thumb.

01:01:17.307 --> 01:01:19.777
- "Rule of thumb."
- Shut up.

01:01:19.877 --> 01:01:21.634
No, I don't know.

01:01:22.613 --> 01:01:25.447
- Maybe I should date someone a little bit more...
- More mature?

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:31.088
Okay. I was gonna say more,
you know, sure she's gay,

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:34.758
- but, yeah, what do you really think?
- No, I just...

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:38.862
I think that you deserve to be with
somebody who's got their shit together.

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:40.931
Yeah, no, you're right.

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:43.367
Or at the very least someone
who doesn't go on and on

01:01:43.467 --> 01:01:46.503
about how good she is in bed...
while we're in bed.

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:48.537
- What?
- Yeah, I know.

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:52.615
It's kind of hard to stay in the moment
when your partner keeps telling you

01:01:52.715 --> 01:01:55.045
that everything she's doing
is her signature move.

01:01:55.145 --> 01:01:57.614
- She did not.
- No. She did a lot.

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:59.648
Oh, my God.

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:06.957
It's so late.
I should probably get going.

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:08.926
No, don't go. We're having fun.

01:02:09.026 --> 01:02:13.228
I know, but Tim doesn't like it
when I drive home late at night.

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:17.668
Does he like it when you drive home
with your face like that?

01:02:17.768 --> 01:02:20.102
- Gorgeous. It's gorgeous.
- Don't touch me. I'm hideous. Don't touch me.

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:25.943
I promise you, you're gonna
get over Vanessa so fast.

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:28.310
You just gotta get back out there.

01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:00.975
Hi.

01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:15.274
Lucas is bringing fireworks.

01:03:15.374 --> 01:03:18.059
- Tim, no.
- Paige, maybe.

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:24.167
Thank you for getting that.
How much do I owe you?

01:03:25.631 --> 01:03:29.070
Nothing. I think I can afford
some frozen water.

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:36.447
Hey, there's this new lawyer at my firm.
She's really cool, and she's gay.

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:40.183
Yeah. Her name is Angelica.
She's really pretty.

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:42.252
You know, she's got her shit together.

01:03:42.452 --> 01:03:44.488
Angelica.

01:03:44.688 --> 01:03:48.467
Well, I guess if, I don't know, we're free,
we can get a group or something together.

01:03:48.567 --> 01:03:52.294
Yeah. I invited her here today.

01:03:53.759 --> 01:03:57.434
It was super last minute 'cause she doesn't
really know anybody in town, but no big deal.

01:03:57.534 --> 01:04:01.505
- Yeah. You didn't tell her it was a setup, right?
- No. Not at all. No pressure.

01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:04.308
But, you know, wouldn't hurt
if you guys fell in love

01:04:04.408 --> 01:04:08.174
and we went on double dates
and lived happily ever after.

01:04:08.274 --> 01:04:09.744
Okay, psycho.

01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:15.652
- Do I look too much like a lesbian?
- You are a lesbian.

01:04:16.215 --> 01:04:19.456
Yeah, but I don't want to look... gay.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:22.090
You're, like, offensive to yourself.

01:04:23.225 --> 01:04:25.260
I mean, I'm not offended.

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:33.504
- Is that her?
- Yeah. Isn't she pretty?

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:36.771
- Why is she so dressed up?
- She just came from work.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.811
She rich? That's a really fancy bag.

01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:44.291
I don't know. I don't know her that well.
Come on. Sasha, let's just go say hi.

01:04:44.391 --> 01:04:46.416
No. I don't need to make
a big deal out of saying hi.

01:04:46.516 --> 01:04:48.552
Just... you know,
if we cross paths, then I'll...

01:04:48.652 --> 01:04:49.920
- Come on.
- No.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:51.255
Sasha...

01:04:51.355 --> 01:04:54.691
- So has Sasha ever been with a dude?
- Lucas, she's gay.

01:04:54.791 --> 01:04:57.225
- Well, she flirts with me.
- Brian, she's gay.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.262
Now, that's my type.

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:04.699
Oh, hey. Also gay.

01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:07.371
Your party sucks.

01:05:07.471 --> 01:05:08.839
- No.
- Sasha, chill.

01:05:08.939 --> 01:05:10.806
Is she coming over here?

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:14.011
- Hey! Hi.
- Hi, Paige.

01:05:14.111 --> 01:05:16.380
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you for having me.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.883
Oh, Angelica, this is Sasha.
Sasha, Angelica.

01:05:19.983 --> 01:05:22.517
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:05:27.023 --> 01:05:28.959
So you just came from work.

01:05:29.059 --> 01:05:32.696
Oh, yeah. I had to go in to
finish up some stuff this morning.

01:05:33.676 --> 01:05:35.165
Blows.

01:05:35.365 --> 01:05:39.067
Actually, I didn't mind it. I know
this is nerdy, but I love my work.

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:44.942
- What do you do?
- I'm a receptionist.

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:47.909
And a really talented musician.

01:05:48.544 --> 01:05:50.714
I'm gonna go play beer pong.

01:05:50.814 --> 01:05:52.858
I love beer pong.

01:05:53.171 --> 01:05:54.746
Cool.

01:05:57.254 --> 01:05:58.522
- Even better.
- Does that count?

01:05:58.622 --> 01:05:59.957
Of course that counts.

01:06:00.057 --> 01:06:02.859
- "Does that count?"
- Of course that counts.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:08.565
She drinks P.B.R., she plays beer pong,
she is the perfect woman.

01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:11.468
Brian, you're just... You're drunk now.
We need a new player.

01:06:11.568 --> 01:06:13.637
- Does anyone want...
- Angelica, you want to get in there?

01:06:13.737 --> 01:06:15.572
- I'm in.
- Come on up.

01:06:15.672 --> 01:06:16.907
Cool, Tim. Cool, man.

01:06:17.007 --> 01:06:20.410
I don't think we need another player.
You don't want to get your suit all...

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.679
- Screw it. I hate this suit.
- ...messed up.

01:06:22.779 --> 01:06:26.516
You're really good at this.
You should, give me some tips.

01:06:27.179 --> 01:06:29.751
I think I'm actually gonna
just sit this one out.

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:33.490
I'm just gonna finish my beer.

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:36.925
Sasha, this is for you.
I call it my signature move.

01:06:40.170 --> 01:06:44.668
Angelica! Get it. Yeah.

01:06:44.768 --> 01:06:46.767
- More.
- More!

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:50.073
Crap. I am such a klutz.

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:52.209
- Be right back.
- That's commitment.

01:06:52.969 --> 01:06:56.313
- Sasha, you should go help her clean up.
- It's fine. I think she's got it.

01:06:56.413 --> 01:07:00.017
Sasha, you should go help her clean up.
It'll give you guys a chance to talk.

01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:02.652
I think she's got it.
I'm gonna go get some chips.

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:04.319
Sasha...

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:08.191
- Sasha.
- What?

01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:11.661
- Why are you not trying, like, at all?
- What are you talking about?

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:15.132
- I thought you said there was no pressure.
- There isn't, but you're, like, being rude.

01:07:15.432 --> 01:07:17.612
How am I being rude?
She doesn't even know it's a setup.

01:07:20.869 --> 01:07:22.292
You told her it's a setup.

01:07:22.392 --> 01:07:24.174
I just thought you guys
would really like each other.

01:07:24.274 --> 01:07:28.486
- Why? Because you know she's not my type.
- Well, maybe that would be good for you.

01:07:28.786 --> 01:07:30.445
- Good for me?
- You know what I mean.

01:07:30.545 --> 01:07:33.217
You were the one who was just saying that
you wanted to date someone more mature.

01:07:33.317 --> 01:07:35.652
You're the one who keeps saying that.

01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:39.523
I'm sorry that I don't like the one person
that you've ever tried to set me up with.

01:07:39.623 --> 01:07:41.829
You were really picky
when you were single too, remember?

01:07:41.929 --> 01:07:42.826
Not like this.

01:07:42.926 --> 01:07:45.762
You're saying that you would have liked
the male equivalent of Angelica?

01:07:45.862 --> 01:07:48.532
- Yes.
- That is such bullshit.

01:07:48.632 --> 01:07:50.634
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

01:07:50.734 --> 01:07:55.472
You're saying that if a man
showed up at a barbecue in a suit

01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:58.675
and was saying things like,
"Oh, crap. I'm such a klutz"

01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:02.010
and was hovering all over you,
you would have been into that?

01:08:06.014 --> 01:08:07.682
Angelica...

01:08:11.553 --> 01:08:13.154
Thank you.

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:18.828
Angelica, please, you have to believe me,
this has zero to do with you.

01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:20.596
This is all about me and Sasha.

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:23.200
Honestly, it doesn't even matter.
I'm too old for this shit.

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:26.424
- But...
- See you at work. Thanks for the invite.

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:33.475
I don't even know why I try.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:37.314
- What do you mean?
- Just be honest with me.

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:40.383
If you don't want to change anything
about your life, just say that.

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:43.886
Admit that you're happy dating 22-year-olds
and going out every night,

01:08:43.987 --> 01:08:46.957
and I will stop putting myself
out there trying to help you.

01:08:47.057 --> 01:08:49.593
I never asked you
to put yourself out there.

01:08:49.693 --> 01:08:53.162
Okay. Then stop calling me every day
complaining about your life

01:08:53.263 --> 01:08:56.832
and then not do anything about it,
because it's a little confusing for me.

01:08:56.933 --> 01:08:58.265
Okay. Fine!

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:02.872
Guess I should have known that as soon as
you found someone else to couple up with

01:09:03.073 --> 01:09:05.206
that you'd be done with me.

01:09:07.475 --> 01:09:12.816
Sasha, that is not fair. Okay, yes, I'm less
available to you now than I was before,

01:09:12.916 --> 01:09:17.087
when there was no one else in my life and we
talked every night till two in the morning,

01:09:17.187 --> 01:09:20.223
but that was always gonna change
when one of us met someone.

01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:23.087
I mean, you don't talk to your friends
till 2:00 in the morning anymore.

01:09:23.187 --> 01:09:25.368
You stop needing that.

01:09:26.862 --> 01:09:28.729
But you still have that.

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:31.356
What?

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:35.939
You...

01:09:36.139 --> 01:09:39.142
You still talk to someone
at 2:00 in the morning.

01:09:39.551 --> 01:09:41.408
It's just Tim now.

01:09:42.144 --> 01:09:44.113
Nothing changed for you.

01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:47.982
It just changed for me.
Can you acknowledge that, please?

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:52.255
Hey.

01:09:52.654 --> 01:09:54.589
Who wants some more s'mores?

01:09:57.926 --> 01:09:59.561
Why don't you tell him?

01:10:01.063 --> 01:10:03.431
You tell him everything else.

01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:10.772
Did I fuck something up?

01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:22.219
Good evening. Can I take your order?

01:10:22.319 --> 01:10:26.423
Yeah, can I just have an order
of mozzarella sticks, please?

01:10:26.523 --> 01:10:29.059
Oh, I'm sorry.
We are out of mozzarella sticks.

01:10:29.159 --> 01:10:31.892
Would you like some curly fries instead?

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:42.606
Excuse me?

01:10:42.706 --> 01:10:44.172
Ma'am?

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:50.980
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.517
Are you still thinking
about that fight with Sasha?

01:10:53.617 --> 01:10:57.418
That's so crazy she got so mad
just 'cause you're trying to set her up.

01:11:45.033 --> 01:11:49.639
You know, when I came into this
to prove to myself that...

01:11:49.739 --> 01:11:52.142
Did they say why they're
making them swim in the shark tank?

01:11:52.242 --> 01:11:54.277
It's just funny.

01:11:54.777 --> 01:11:56.213
What's a booty tooch?

01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:59.015
It's one of Tyra's sayings. It's when
you stick your butt out in pictures.

01:11:59.115 --> 01:12:01.516
It's like the new smize.

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:04.986
Smiling with your eyes.

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.697
I don't look at my lupus as a handicap.

01:12:13.797 --> 01:12:16.366
I look at it as a beautiful
part of me that makes me unique.

01:12:16.466 --> 01:12:19.002
Yeah, right. It is a handicap.

01:12:19.102 --> 01:12:22.337
Hope you have enough energy
to swim away from those sharks.

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:27.042
You're so funny.

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:44.425
You're, like, the funniest person
I've ever dated.

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:56.537
- Are you Paige Kearns?
- Yes.

01:12:57.806 --> 01:12:59.625
You've been served.

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:16.993
Oh, he's taking you to court?

01:13:17.093 --> 01:13:19.296
Good thing I'm a lawyer.

01:13:19.796 --> 01:13:23.713
- Okay. Please tell me you're not serious.
- I am.

01:13:23.813 --> 01:13:25.794
Come on, Paige.
You really care so much about this,

01:13:25.894 --> 01:13:27.370
you're gonna take our
next-door neighbor to court?

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.339
He sued me.

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:33.176
You hit his car.
You didn't pay him for it.

01:13:33.376 --> 01:13:35.111
I knew it.

01:13:35.211 --> 01:13:38.481
I knew you thought I was wrong.
Why'd you lie to me?

01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:40.517
'Cause it's easier than
disagreeing with you.

01:13:40.617 --> 01:13:43.253
- You can disagree with me.
- Can I? Like, right now?

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:45.977
I am not mad at you because
you're disagreeing with me.

01:13:46.077 --> 01:13:49.494
- I am mad because you lied to me.
- Okay.

01:13:49.594 --> 01:13:52.705
- Oh, great. So now you're just walking away.
- I can't talk to you sometimes.

01:13:52.805 --> 01:13:56.758
You never see anyone else's side... ever.
You always get your way.

01:13:56.858 --> 01:13:59.636
It's like every time we fight,
I have to be the one to apologize.

01:13:59.736 --> 01:14:03.039
- I'm not gonna do it this time.
- Oh, really? I always get my way?

01:14:03.139 --> 01:14:07.174
Paige, I let you fucking dress me.

01:14:09.544 --> 01:14:12.891
- I do not dress you.
- You can't even admit that?

01:14:12.991 --> 01:14:15.897
- This is just who I am.
- Well, then you suck.

01:14:15.997 --> 01:14:19.989
- Great. Now you're just being a dick.
- Maybe I just found my dick.

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:22.993
Whatever! You know,
I deserve to be with somebody

01:14:23.093 --> 01:14:28.029
who appreciates me the way that I am.
And if you can't do that, then...

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:32.100
Gotcha.

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:44.347
A package does not
just disappear, Valerie.

01:14:44.447 --> 01:14:47.750
I know. I'm trying to figure it out.
FedEx keeps telling me there's no record of it.

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:50.887
- Let me see the package log.
- No. I'll do it.

01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:54.188
- What are you guys looking for?
- A package that was sent to China.

01:14:57.859 --> 01:15:01.164
I don't even see any international
shipments on this log.

01:15:01.264 --> 01:15:05.135
You know what? I am actually
a little bit behind on that log,

01:15:05.235 --> 01:15:08.438
and FedEx loses packages
all the time, right?

01:15:08.538 --> 01:15:11.541
Rarely. And this one cost us a job.

01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:15.442
They accepted a competing bid
because ours wasn't in on time.

01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:50.547
- Tim and I had a fight.
- Oh, honey.

01:15:50.647 --> 01:15:52.813
What did he do?

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:56.550
- Shithead.
- I know.

01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:27.448
Sasha.

01:16:29.617 --> 01:16:31.112
Hey.

01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:32.786
Hi!

01:16:34.424 --> 01:16:36.423
- Yo.
- Hey.

01:16:37.692 --> 01:16:39.062
Is Paige here?

01:16:39.162 --> 01:16:42.296
No. No, just me.

01:16:43.765 --> 01:16:45.165
What's new?

01:16:46.024 --> 01:16:47.974
- Not much.
- Yeah?

01:16:48.074 --> 01:16:52.533
- I got fired.
- Oh, shit. Shit. Sorry.

01:16:53.042 --> 01:16:56.143
- Paige didn't tell me.
- Oh, she doesn't know.

01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:59.113
I haven't seen her since your barbecue.

01:17:00.682 --> 01:17:03.194
Oh, man. I...

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:07.757
Wow. I knew you guys got in
a little fight over the setup, but...

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:11.125
That's what she said it was about?

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:15.029
I'm guessing maybe that
wasn't the whole story?

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:19.109
Yeah. Yeah.

01:17:19.909 --> 01:17:21.936
She has a way of doing that.

01:17:23.638 --> 01:17:26.409
So then she probably
didn't tell you that...

01:17:26.509 --> 01:17:28.678
we got in a fight.

01:17:28.778 --> 01:17:30.613
She's staying at her mom's.

01:17:30.713 --> 01:17:35.318
Really? What happened?
Okay. Sorry. It's none of my business.

01:17:35.418 --> 01:17:39.822
No, it's fine. It's fine. It's all right.
It's... It's kind of a long story,

01:17:39.922 --> 01:17:42.790
but basically we're both
waiting for an apology.

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:45.559
From Paige?

01:17:46.928 --> 01:17:48.729
Good luck with that.

01:17:50.899 --> 01:17:53.102
Sorry about your job.

01:17:53.202 --> 01:17:58.141
Yeah. There's nothing like, you know,
getting fired from an entry-level job

01:17:58.241 --> 01:18:02.679
right before you turn 30 to just...
make you question everything.

01:18:02.779 --> 01:18:07.817
Well, I wouldn't... I mean, I hope it's
not making you question everything.

01:18:07.917 --> 01:18:09.516
Who cares about that job?
You got your music.

01:18:09.616 --> 01:18:11.616
That's the point, right?
I mean, that's your passion.

01:18:12.417 --> 01:18:14.947
Well, it kind of has to be your passion
when you spent your whole life saying

01:18:15.047 --> 01:18:18.208
it's all you ever wanted to do,
and your parents spent a shitload of money

01:18:18.308 --> 01:18:22.925
on music school and...
I couldn't even quit if I wanted to.

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:27.403
- Do you want to?
- Whatever.

01:18:28.203 --> 01:18:30.473
It's a little late to turn back now.

01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:34.423
Well, you know, that is what I did, actually.
I used to want to...

01:18:34.523 --> 01:18:37.547
- I used to want to work on Wall Street.
- Really?

01:18:38.247 --> 01:18:40.917
Wall Street was
my favorite movie as a kid,

01:18:41.017 --> 01:18:43.186
and I went to business school
for a year, actually.

01:18:43.286 --> 01:18:46.456
If you want to talk about
expensive schools, there you go.

01:18:46.556 --> 01:18:48.391
What happened?

01:18:48.919 --> 01:18:51.027
I fucking hated
business school, so I quit.

01:18:51.127 --> 01:18:56.196
I figured better to turn back now than spend
the rest of my life hating it, you know.

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:06.676
- So where's your girlfriend?
- Mia? She's not my girlfriend.

01:19:06.876 --> 01:19:10.611
Please. She will be.
She's hot, and she worships you.

01:19:12.147 --> 01:19:15.750
Speaking of worship,
that girl should be on a throne.

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:17.972
Damn.

01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:25.662
Oh, my God. She's so desperate.

01:19:26.062 --> 01:19:28.095
I was never that crazy
when I was single, was I?

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:31.768
I can't picture you single.

01:19:31.868 --> 01:19:34.582
Yeah? Well, you don't have to, baby.

01:19:47.681 --> 01:19:49.085
Breathtaking.

01:19:49.185 --> 01:19:51.487
Yeah, it's pretty.
I still don't know about a strapless.

01:19:51.587 --> 01:19:54.090
I just feel like it's falling off of me.

01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:59.161
Oh, no. You're being crazy.
They're gonna make it fit like a glove.

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:01.862
- See? This thing is not moving anywhere.
- Mom. Okay. Okay.

01:20:04.773 --> 01:20:07.692
Watch out. Watch out. Where you going?

01:20:08.192 --> 01:20:11.505
Oh, honey, please do not check
to see if Tim's called again.

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:16.713
Come on. Let's stay on task.
Is this a yes? Maybe?

01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:18.233
Mom, it's been two days.

01:20:18.333 --> 01:20:21.800
I mean, I haven't not spoken to him
in two days since I met him.

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:25.486
Well, why don't you let him
come to you in his own time?

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:28.152
Yeah, but what if he doesn't call me?

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:31.494
I'll just give you ladies a minute.

01:20:31.594 --> 01:20:34.697
Thank you. He will. Come on.

01:20:34.797 --> 01:20:39.202
Men are like children.
They'll do whatever you want.

01:20:39.302 --> 01:20:41.737
They just have to think
that it's their idea.

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:44.974
Come here. Look at this.
Do you think he's gonna let that go?

01:20:45.074 --> 01:20:48.211
Well, he might if you're scowling
like that. Come on. Smile.

01:20:48.311 --> 01:20:51.647
We only get to do this once! Hopefully.

01:20:51.747 --> 01:20:53.650
Can we just do this another time?

01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:57.320
I feel weird looking at wedding dresses
when I'm not even speaking to my fiancé.

01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:00.723
Oh, come on. Let's do a couple more.
So is this a yes or a maybe?

01:21:00.823 --> 01:21:04.627
- No. I don't like it.
- Now you're just being dramatic.

01:21:04.727 --> 01:21:06.770
- If you want my advice, you should...
- I don't want your advice.

01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:10.299
Listen, twenty years from now,
when you look at these wedding pictures,

01:21:10.399 --> 01:21:13.202
a strapless dress
will be so much more elegant.

01:21:13.302 --> 01:21:17.573
What is with you and a strapless?
I don't like it. It's not me. It's a cliché.

01:21:17.673 --> 01:21:21.244
It's not flattering, and I'm not
wearing it for my wedding.

01:21:21.979 --> 01:21:26.218
- Fine. Why didn't you just say so?
- I've been trying to,

01:21:26.318 --> 01:21:29.085
but every time I try to say something,
you just talk over me,

01:21:29.185 --> 01:21:33.287
and you insist that you're right,
and it always has to be your way.

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:38.192
Tim?

01:21:39.961 --> 01:21:41.428
Tim?

01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:48.269
Tim?

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:04.153
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:07.737
Oh, guys, go in the house
right now, please. Go right now.

01:22:07.837 --> 01:22:10.703
No, no, no. I'm not gonna do anything.

01:22:10.803 --> 01:22:15.662
I... I just wanted to tell you
that I was texting when I hit your car.

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.103
I know that it's...

01:22:21.203 --> 01:22:23.873
I know that it's really dangerous,
and people have been killed like that,

01:22:23.973 --> 01:22:28.175
and I need to stop, but first,
can I just pay for your bumper?

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:33.716
Yes.

01:22:33.816 --> 01:22:36.583
Yeah. Yes, you can. Thank you.

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:21.355
Bear!

01:23:21.455 --> 01:23:22.744
Hey.

01:23:23.472 --> 01:23:25.568
- How are you?
- What are you doing here?

01:23:25.668 --> 01:23:28.371
I just wanted to come hang out.

01:23:29.374 --> 01:23:32.940
I left you a message saying
I'm not free. Did you not get it?

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:37.911
Dude, I don't even know where
the fuck my phone is right now.

01:23:39.914 --> 01:23:41.315
How high are you?

01:23:47.488 --> 01:23:51.260
Ta-da! I'm making you
matching mittens tomorrow.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.196
You're gonna look so cute in Alaska.

01:23:54.296 --> 01:23:55.931
Alaska?

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:57.900
Oh, shit.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.636
I forgot to surprise you.

01:24:00.736 --> 01:24:03.470
Wait. Does that make sense?
Forgot to surprise you?

01:24:04.839 --> 01:24:09.345
Anyway, Tegan and Sara are doing
this secret concert series in Alaska,

01:24:09.445 --> 01:24:12.248
and for a week,
you stay in an igloo and do Molly,

01:24:12.348 --> 01:24:14.917
and every morning you wake up,
and they're performing with, like,

01:24:15.017 --> 01:24:17.684
a chorus of Latin monks.

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:23.492
What do you mean? They're Latin American,
or they sing in Latin?

01:24:23.692 --> 01:24:25.561
I don't know.

01:24:25.861 --> 01:24:27.697
Maybe they're not Latin.

01:24:27.797 --> 01:24:30.633
Well, I can't go anyway,
because I really need to find a job.

01:24:30.733 --> 01:24:34.103
You can do that when we get back.
I mean, you can get any receptionist job.

01:24:34.203 --> 01:24:36.439
You've got, like,
eight years experience, right?

01:24:36.539 --> 01:24:39.141
Yeah. I know.

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:41.944
Whatever. It's just till
you're done with your album.

01:24:42.044 --> 01:24:44.611
I don't know if that's
what I want to do anymore.

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:50.186
What do you mean?
I thought music was your dream.

01:24:50.686 --> 01:24:51.906
Yeah, I know.

01:24:52.006 --> 01:24:54.810
My dream was to be a musician, not...

01:24:55.150 --> 01:24:57.826
spend every day having panic attacks
and sitting behind a reception desk

01:24:57.926 --> 01:25:00.927
for eight hours
wanting to blow my brains out.

01:25:01.396 --> 01:25:03.371
I just think I...

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:10.671
I've tried so hard to hang on to this goal,
and I'm wasting my life. I...

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:15.575
I don't know.
I just want to be happy, and I...

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:19.646
I think I need to find
a job I don't hate.

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:24.785
But can't you do that after
we get back from Alaska?

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.356
Come on.

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:30.757
- Please?
- No. Stop it!

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:38.200
I'm sorry. That... It's not your fault.
I just... I can't do this.

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:42.402
Alaska? I know. You just said that.

01:25:43.371 --> 01:25:45.939
No, I mean,

01:25:46.874 --> 01:25:48.542
Mia...

01:26:31.052 --> 01:26:33.355
Call voice mail.

01:26:33.455 --> 01:26:37.993
- Sorry. I don't understand.
- Call voice mail.

01:26:38.093 --> 01:26:41.628
- Sorry. I don't understand.
- Fuck it.

01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:15.334
Hey, bitch!

01:27:50.965 --> 01:27:52.568
Just tell me. I hate surprises.

01:27:52.668 --> 01:27:55.738
No. You'll just have
to find out tomorrow.

01:27:55.838 --> 01:27:58.808
You can't not tell me what song
you're gonna sing at my wedding.

01:27:58.908 --> 01:28:01.410
Okay, fine. I'll tell you.

01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:04.011
You know that song that's like...

01:28:04.111 --> 01:28:08.150
- Grind it, girl...
- No. Nope. Not happening.

01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:10.951
Okay. Fine, fine, fine.
Sorry. I'll tell you.

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:18.227
Did you know that the Hanson brothers
are still making music?

01:28:18.927 --> 01:28:20.963
Sometimes I just want to...

01:28:21.463 --> 01:28:24.497
- Please, just tell me, Sasha.
- Okay, fine. I'll tell you.

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:28.368
But first I have a really
serious question.

01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:31.571
Hang on.

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:40.780
Do you think that Tim
will be jealous of my tux?

01:28:42.817 --> 01:28:44.451
No.

01:28:45.305 --> 01:28:51.424
