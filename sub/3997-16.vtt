00:15.600 --> 00:17.900
Oh, you kissed her! You idiot!

00:18.367 --> 00:20.503
You...

00:29.512 --> 00:31.146
No, no, no.

00:31.214 --> 00:32.815
I wasn't doing anything.
I wasn't. No, no, no.

00:32.883 --> 00:34.816
I wasn't doing anything,
I wasn't doing anything, I...

00:34.884 --> 00:36.250
Do not walk away from me.

00:36.318 --> 00:38.286
Do not. You are not.

00:38.353 --> 00:40.187
You're doing it. Nick?

00:40.255 --> 00:41.255
- Shamone.
- He did.

00:51.533 --> 00:52.933
Oh.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.935
Ugh, my God.

00:55.002 --> 00:56.537
Oh, I just woke up.

00:56.604 --> 00:58.739
I've been sleeping for hours and hours.

00:58.807 --> 01:00.541
Nice. Me, too.

01:00.608 --> 01:02.342
Let's see here.

01:03.445 --> 01:06.278
Oh, sweet. Ten e-mails.

01:09.249 --> 01:11.818
Hey, Sam, um...

01:12.585 --> 01:13.619
I have to tell you something.

01:13.687 --> 01:16.355
How do you always look
so beautiful in the morning?

01:16.423 --> 01:18.458
Sometimes I can't even look at you.

01:18.525 --> 01:20.259
I can't even--
I got to look away.

01:20.327 --> 01:21.693
I can't even look at you right now.

01:21.761 --> 01:23.628
Wait, but I got to.
Now I got to look away.

01:24.096 --> 01:25.931
I just can't resist.
Oh, geez.

01:27.248 --> 01:28.990
What were you gonna say?

01:31.170 --> 01:32.403
Nothing.

01:32.472 --> 01:34.005
It was nothing.

01:36.275 --> 01:36.908
Jess?

01:36.976 --> 01:38.076
Nick kissed me.

01:51.223 --> 01:53.891
Oh, man. Okay.

01:53.959 --> 01:56.593
I had the best sex of
my life last night.

01:56.660 --> 01:58.161
Winston, I'm glad you're here.
We need to talk.

01:58.229 --> 01:59.229
Yeah. Daisy said I was
pretty good.

01:59.297 --> 02:01.198
You hear that?
Pretty good!

02:01.265 --> 02:02.065
This is important.

02:02.133 --> 02:03.700
And I ain't even use my hands.

02:03.767 --> 02:04.807
You didn't use your hands?

02:04.869 --> 02:06.403
Well, just I did a lot of side stuff.

02:06.471 --> 02:07.371
Okay, Winston, you're killing me.

02:07.438 --> 02:08.872
I really need to talk to you,

02:08.939 --> 02:11.019
and now after hearing that,
I can barely look at you.

02:11.041 --> 02:12.541
Well, I got my mojo back, baby!

02:12.609 --> 02:14.743
I'm the Mojo Man!

02:14.811 --> 02:17.413
Mojo Man, Mojo Man.
I like the sound of that.

02:17.481 --> 02:19.015
Yeah, we're not gonna be
getting to my thing, are we?

02:19.082 --> 02:20.649
Mo-Mo-Mojo Man.

02:20.717 --> 02:21.717
I got to tell Sam.

02:21.784 --> 02:23.319
I can't tell Sam!

02:23.387 --> 02:24.487
I didn't even do anything wrong!

02:24.554 --> 02:25.654
Nick kissed me!

02:25.722 --> 02:27.822
I didn't even kiss him back!

02:27.890 --> 02:29.590
Okay, fine!
I kissed him back!

02:29.658 --> 02:30.925
Is that what you want me to say?

02:30.993 --> 02:32.293
I literally haven't said a word

02:32.361 --> 02:33.828
for, like, over an hour.

02:33.896 --> 02:35.176
And now he won't even talk to me,

02:35.231 --> 02:36.631
'cause I saw him this morning

02:36.698 --> 02:38.599
and he just panic
moonwalked away from me.

02:38.667 --> 02:39.907
- He what?
- He does that sometimes.

02:41.037 --> 02:42.936
Man. Terrorism.

02:46.174 --> 02:48.008
And then... ha!

02:48.076 --> 02:49.776
Nick just... He just...

02:49.844 --> 02:50.844
Kisses you.

02:50.912 --> 02:52.312
Stupid Nick Miller.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.260
How was it? Was it...?

02:53.281 --> 02:54.714
I was like Scarlett O'Hara

02:54.782 --> 02:56.583
in my freaking curtain dress...

02:56.651 --> 02:57.884
How did he do it?

02:57.952 --> 03:00.086
- He just, like, grabbed me.
- Uh-huh.

03:00.154 --> 03:01.754
- And he just took me.
- Oh, yeah.

03:01.821 --> 03:03.256
I mean, he was a man and I was a woman.

03:03.323 --> 03:05.824
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- It was firm, but tender.

03:05.892 --> 03:07.360
- Oh, damn.
- Yeah, I mean,

03:07.428 --> 03:09.108
I saw thorough space and time
for a minute,

03:09.163 --> 03:10.430
but that's not the point.

03:10.497 --> 03:11.830
Oh, man!

03:11.898 --> 03:12.831
Are you okay?

03:12.899 --> 03:14.799
I miss sex!

03:14.867 --> 03:17.669
I've been on dates set up by
my mother for the past month.

03:17.736 --> 03:19.371
- Mm.
- I mean, what are you gonna do?

03:19.439 --> 03:21.173
I mean, do you...

03:21.240 --> 03:22.174
like Nick?

03:22.241 --> 03:24.109
Ah! Bah!

03:24.177 --> 03:25.110
Mm-hmm.

03:25.178 --> 03:26.878
Nah! Neh?

03:26.946 --> 03:28.280
Nick?

03:29.648 --> 03:30.681
No.

03:32.451 --> 03:33.784
I don't like Nick.

03:33.851 --> 03:35.052
- Mm-hmm.
- I like Sam, 'cause

03:35.120 --> 03:36.853
Sam's the kind of guy who fixes things

03:36.921 --> 03:38.289
that you didn't even know were broken.

03:38.356 --> 03:40.057
And Nick is the type of guy

03:40.125 --> 03:43.458
who breaks things... that are...

03:43.795 --> 03:45.162
He breaks things!

03:45.230 --> 03:46.762
Look at that.
It's for my grandma.

03:46.830 --> 03:48.664
Wow, that's... oh, no.

03:48.732 --> 03:50.266
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- What are you-- Nick!

03:50.334 --> 03:52.001
- No, let me just...
- Nick, Nick, what are you...?

03:52.069 --> 03:53.069
- Okay, here, it's fine.
- No!

03:53.104 --> 03:54.737
Nick, what are you...?

03:54.805 --> 03:57.807
I think those belong back on it.

03:57.874 --> 04:00.176
He is not getting in the way
of me and Sam.

04:00.244 --> 04:02.078
He is not ruining this.

04:02.145 --> 04:03.479
- Mm.
- So mad at him.

04:03.546 --> 04:04.846
I can't even be around him.

04:04.914 --> 04:06.081
Can I just spend the day with you?

04:06.149 --> 04:07.516
Oh.

04:07.984 --> 04:09.618
Well, um...

04:09.685 --> 04:13.018
Okay, I didn't tell you this
before, actually, but, uh...

04:14.090 --> 04:15.190
<i>Cece is going to</i>

04:15.258 --> 04:16.690
an Indian marriage convention today

04:16.759 --> 04:18.459
to find herself a brown husband.

04:18.527 --> 04:19.827
Now, little does she know

04:19.894 --> 04:22.196
that I have signed up
for the same convention.

04:22.264 --> 04:23.897
Gentlemen, there is nothing that says

04:23.965 --> 04:26.100
white men need not apply.

04:26.168 --> 04:27.568
You look like
the fortune teller in <i>Big.</i>

04:27.636 --> 04:29.103
Wait a second, is it in the loft?

04:29.171 --> 04:30.871
Yes, Nick.

04:30.939 --> 04:33.341
The West Coast's premiere
Indian singles event,

04:33.408 --> 04:35.675
where 300 eligible
Rajput Indians get together

04:35.743 --> 04:37.710
to see if they should get
arranged-married to each other,

04:37.778 --> 04:39.346
is in our loft.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.780
So if it's not, then I'm coming with.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.682
I'm in, Schmidty.
You finally got company.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.784
- I'm coming. Let's do it.
- The Mojo Man is in, too.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.419
Mojo Man, Mojo Man.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.021
Okay, neither of you are coming.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.589
I've been studying up for a full week.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.190
I can actually speak
conversational Hindi.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.359
"Hello." "Hello."

04:53.426 --> 04:55.127
"Samosa?"
"Yes, please, Samosa."

04:55.195 --> 04:56.562
"More towels?"
"Do you know where

04:56.630 --> 04:57.896
the white person's
toilet is?"

04:57.964 --> 04:59.325
After that, it gets very confusing.

04:59.366 --> 05:00.566
Can you drive in that dress?

05:01.234 --> 05:02.401
You're right, I can't.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.109
- All right, you're driving. Let's go.
- Yeah!

05:09.608 --> 05:11.209
Hi, I'm-I'm checking in.

05:11.277 --> 05:12.443
My name's Cecilia Parikh.

05:12.511 --> 05:14.011
This is my best friend.

05:14.079 --> 05:15.547
She's just, she's just here to watch.

05:15.614 --> 05:17.215
All must participate.

05:17.283 --> 05:19.217
We've had a lot of
trouble with watchers.

05:22.620 --> 05:23.820
You participate or you go home.

05:25.256 --> 05:28.225
All right, you know what?
What the hell.

05:28.293 --> 05:29.926
You're going to have to
fill out a questionnaire.

05:29.994 --> 05:31.795
Information, education, resume.

05:32.697 --> 05:33.963
Done.

05:34.031 --> 05:35.632
Thank you.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.769
What the hell are you guys doing here?

05:40.837 --> 05:42.505
You look like a character
from <i>The Love Guru.</i>

05:42.573 --> 05:44.006
Aw, thank you.

05:45.074 --> 05:45.874
Hello.

05:45.875 --> 05:48.010
I'd like to check in
with my two friends here.

05:48.078 --> 05:49.645
Look, we are not Indian,
but you cannot turn us away,

05:49.713 --> 05:52.480
because I read the Website
vigorously, <i>kumari.</i>

05:52.548 --> 05:53.416
- Oh, God.
- That means "miss."

05:53.983 --> 05:55.217
My friend right there?

05:55.284 --> 05:56.885
Yeah, he's a <i>vakeel.</i>
That means "lawyer."

05:56.952 --> 05:58.019
I dropped out
of ka-heel school.

05:58.087 --> 05:59.454
It's <i>vakeel,</i> man.

06:00.923 --> 06:01.856
What are you doing here?

06:01.924 --> 06:04.092
Oh, no. I just-- uh, yeah...

06:04.159 --> 06:06.127
Oh!

06:06.195 --> 06:07.995
Nick, you're embarrassing me.

06:09.731 --> 06:11.497
Nick, what are you doing?

06:13.162 --> 06:14.329
Nick, Nick.

06:14.897 --> 06:16.629
N-N-N-Nick, what
are you doing?

06:16.630 --> 06:18.431
Stop moonwalking, man.

06:18.499 --> 06:20.133
Man, you have been weird all morning.

06:20.701 --> 06:22.568
Hey, look, I kissed Jess.

06:25.305 --> 06:26.972
Say what you're gonna say.

06:27.040 --> 06:29.508
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

06:29.775 --> 06:31.110
Whoo!

06:31.677 --> 06:33.045
I thought that's
what you were gonna say.

06:33.113 --> 06:34.413
I don't want a new roommate.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.181
Look, don't...
She's not moving out.

06:36.299 --> 06:37.533
I'm not talking about her.
Hell no, not her!

06:37.600 --> 06:38.768
I'm talking about you.

06:38.886 --> 06:40.119
When this thing blows
up in your face--

06:40.436 --> 06:41.603
and it will blow up
in your face, Nick--

06:41.671 --> 06:42.771
you're the one moving out.

06:42.838 --> 06:45.006
You think I like living with you?

06:45.074 --> 06:47.341
You have centipedes
living under your bed!

06:47.409 --> 06:49.678
- Those weren't centipedes.
- You've named your testicles,

06:49.745 --> 06:51.465
- and they're both named Sharon.
- Yeah, so what?

06:51.480 --> 06:53.347
I can't believe you kissed Jess!
Man, what were you thinking?

06:53.415 --> 06:54.895
Look, man, I wasn't thinking anything.

06:56.719 --> 06:58.679
Nick, just apologize and
make it right, all right?

07:00.321 --> 07:03.123
All right.
That's what I'm gonna do.

07:06.393 --> 07:07.127
Oh, Sharon!

07:07.195 --> 07:08.195
- Get! Just...
- Get...?

07:08.262 --> 07:09.429
Get over here now.

07:09.497 --> 07:10.898
Wait. What?

07:10.965 --> 07:13.067
You told me you had moved on.

07:13.134 --> 07:15.835
Only people who haven't moved
on say things like that.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.670
I'm a squirrel.
You're my nut.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.899
Winter's coming. I'm gonna
store you in my cheek, girl.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.607
Please leave.

07:21.675 --> 07:24.643
You and I not being together
does not make sense to me.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.180
I miss your body

07:27.247 --> 07:28.647
and the things I used to do to it.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.215
- Schmidt.
- I'm talking about sex.

07:30.282 --> 07:34.086
Today is about me finding
someone within my own culture

07:34.087 --> 07:36.287
that I can build my life with.

07:36.355 --> 07:38.256
It's about more than sex.

07:38.324 --> 07:41.657
Our sex was about more than sex.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.096
It was about history and memory

07:44.163 --> 07:46.296
and thousands of years
of colonial suffering

07:46.364 --> 07:49.399
all being released in one
moment of pure ecstasy.

07:49.467 --> 07:51.869
Then why did the sex
always end with you yelling,

07:51.937 --> 07:53.938
"Blammo, that happened"?

07:55.005 --> 07:56.073
Blammo.

07:57.442 --> 07:59.176
Thank you.

08:00.878 --> 08:01.612
Hey.

08:01.679 --> 08:03.246
Oh, you can walk normally now, I see.

08:03.313 --> 08:04.680
I'm sorry I kissed you.

08:05.749 --> 08:06.549
Well, oh, wow.

08:07.117 --> 08:07.917
That was unexpected.

08:08.985 --> 08:09.652
Thanks, Nick.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.821
- You know what, it was a mistake.
- I feel better.

08:11.889 --> 08:13.223
- 'Cause, yeah, I was feeling awkward.
- Yeah, good.

08:13.290 --> 08:14.390
Right.

08:14.458 --> 08:15.992
You were acting a little bit weird,

08:16.060 --> 08:17.893
but honestly, for me,
it was, like, a nothing kiss.

08:17.961 --> 08:19.995
You know, it was like kissing a cousin.

08:20.063 --> 08:21.329
It was so nonsexual and nothing.

08:21.897 --> 08:24.633
Well... I think it
meant something.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.568
You know, to you, 'cause you kissed me.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.470
Mm-mm.

08:29.037 --> 08:31.006
I think you can admit it
meant something to you, Nick.

08:31.074 --> 08:33.174
Oh, no, I-I'm telling you,
it meant nothing to me.

08:33.243 --> 08:34.275
- I think it did.
- No, no.

08:34.342 --> 08:36.309
I do things I don't mean all the time.

08:36.378 --> 08:37.678
Like this. You see this?
Bottle of water.

08:37.746 --> 08:39.013
Why did I do that?
I don't know.

08:39.081 --> 08:40.815
It doesn't mean anything.

08:40.883 --> 08:43.083
I think you can admit that
it meant something to you.

08:43.152 --> 08:45.486
- Hey, Jessica, it didn't.
- Hmm.

08:45.553 --> 08:48.055
It was a drinking game,
and I was finishing the game.

08:48.123 --> 08:49.556
Yeah, but it happened after the game

08:49.624 --> 08:51.291
when it meant something.

08:51.358 --> 08:53.860
- Oh, so it meant something to <i>you?</i>
- What?

08:53.928 --> 08:55.862
- It meant something to you.
- No, don't...

08:55.930 --> 08:57.864
If you think some
stupid, terrible kiss...

08:57.932 --> 08:59.599
You're thinking about
it right now! - No!

08:59.667 --> 09:01.868
- I'm calling Sam and...
- Oh, you're calling Sam right now?

09:01.936 --> 09:03.569
He's gonna come here and pick me up,

09:03.637 --> 09:05.371
- and, uh, we're leaving.
- Oh, you are?

09:05.439 --> 09:07.940
Why are you running away?
Because it meant something?

09:08.708 --> 09:10.442
We're not going anywhere.

09:11.710 --> 09:12.945
Meant nothing, Nick!

09:13.513 --> 09:15.247
Please look
at the numbers on your name tags

09:15.315 --> 09:17.516
and go to the table
with the corresponding numbers.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.285
These are your groupings.

09:19.352 --> 09:21.486
People with similar resumes
and education backgrounds

09:21.554 --> 09:23.054
have been grouped together.

09:23.122 --> 09:25.924
34, 34, thir...

09:25.991 --> 09:26.958
Table 34!

09:27.526 --> 09:29.093
We're at the same table!

09:29.161 --> 09:31.229
- So this is rock bottom.
- I mean, call me crazy,

09:31.297 --> 09:33.397
but I think we're all
getting married tonight.

09:33.465 --> 09:35.533
Yeah, um... - The money table
right here, Table 34!

09:35.600 --> 09:37.302
Hi, excuse me, I think
that there's been

09:37.369 --> 09:39.336
just a little bit of a
mistake with the tables.

09:39.403 --> 09:41.205
Over 30, no advanced degrees,

09:41.272 --> 09:43.240
Table 34.

09:43.308 --> 09:45.242
No, see, actually, I'm-I'm
a professional model.

09:45.310 --> 09:46.844
I'm not famous or anything,

09:46.911 --> 09:49.246
but I was in Lil Wayne's last video.

09:49.314 --> 09:51.882
I was the girl he was throwing
strawberries at in slow motion.

09:54.918 --> 09:56.719
Definitely Table 34.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.724
Excuse me?

10:01.791 --> 10:03.425
Uh, I didn't get assigned a table.

10:03.493 --> 10:05.427
Now, I know exactly
what this is about...

10:05.495 --> 10:08.130
But I did assign you a seat.

10:08.198 --> 10:10.798
This one. Lap number one.

10:11.867 --> 10:13.969
Okay, so this is not a racial thing?

10:14.036 --> 10:15.403
Not yet, it isn't.

10:15.471 --> 10:17.038
Ah.

10:17.106 --> 10:18.639
I see what's happening here.

10:19.507 --> 10:20.608
You're feeling my mojo.

10:20.676 --> 10:24.009
You look like a jumpy cat,
and I like that.

10:24.780 --> 10:27.314
Ooh, I like that.

10:28.549 --> 10:30.550
Like oversized blueberries.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.755
Mojo off. Mojo off.

10:34.822 --> 10:37.291
Schmidt, Table Seven, Table Seven.

10:37.359 --> 10:39.826
- What're you doing? You're at Table Seven, too?
- Hmm? I'm at Table Seven.

10:41.295 --> 10:41.928
What?

10:41.996 --> 10:44.197
Well, you should feel complimented.
I feel slightly insulted.

10:44.765 --> 10:45.765
- What?
- No offense.

10:45.832 --> 10:47.767
A lot of offense taken.
Well, I'm just saying...

10:47.834 --> 10:49.468
- A lot.
- Jess!

10:49.536 --> 10:50.536
- Hi!
- Hi.

10:50.604 --> 10:52.071
- How are you?
- Um, okay.

10:52.139 --> 10:54.507
Yeah, I checked in.
Uh, they gave me my table.

10:54.574 --> 10:56.475
- Okay.
- This is a weird date.

10:56.543 --> 10:58.210
I always thought
we'd go bowling before we went

10:58.278 --> 10:59.677
to an Indian marriage convention.

10:59.745 --> 11:01.380
- What table are you at?
- Uh, Table One, I think.

11:01.447 --> 11:04.249
Table One?! It's almost like
you save lives or something.

11:04.317 --> 11:05.517
Oh, wait, you do.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.221
Let's start the icebreakers.

11:09.289 --> 11:11.756
This exercise shows
how physically compatible

11:11.824 --> 11:12.924
two people can be.

11:26.004 --> 11:27.405
Ow! My hand!

11:27.472 --> 11:28.439
What?

11:28.506 --> 11:29.740
Stupid man.

11:30.808 --> 11:31.607
Nice.

11:31.675 --> 11:32.909
- Yeah.
- Ready?

11:32.977 --> 11:34.144
Three, two, ow.

11:34.211 --> 11:36.112
- Ow! No, no. Let's...
- Up?

11:36.180 --> 11:38.315
- No, you go down.
- All right. I go down?

11:38.882 --> 11:40.683
Kind of just got
to get in a little closer.

11:40.751 --> 11:41.484
Okay, I'm trying.

11:42.252 --> 11:43.353
Seriously.

11:48.490 --> 11:49.324
Hey, dummy.

11:49.392 --> 11:51.226
Stop pointing your finger at me.
That's so annoying.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.995
Why are you drinking my beer?

11:53.763 --> 11:55.730
You point that finger at me
one more time, I'm...

11:55.798 --> 11:57.466
Why don't you just admit that
that kiss meant something to you?

11:57.533 --> 11:59.134
No, no! - I could tell it meant
something, so admit it

11:59.202 --> 12:00.436
or I'll do this all day.
I'll do it all day.

12:00.503 --> 12:02.636
Next challenge: Make a table

12:02.704 --> 12:05.773
out of nothing but newspaper and tape.

12:05.841 --> 12:08.476
Women look to your left,
men to the right.

12:08.543 --> 12:09.777
These are your partners.

12:09.845 --> 12:11.412
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.114
First table that can hold
a phone book wins.

12:13.182 --> 12:14.748
All right, so we have to make a table.

12:14.816 --> 12:15.950
Okay.

12:16.018 --> 12:17.151
- Give me the tape.
- No.

12:19.753 --> 12:22.189
I'll tell you what's not
made out of newspaper,

12:22.256 --> 12:24.691
that tight little ass of yours.

12:24.758 --> 12:26.893
Jess, you liked kissing me!
It's fine to say that.

12:26.961 --> 12:28.928
No, I didn't.
I'm not on my knee asking you

12:28.997 --> 12:30.630
to marry me; It was a nice kiss.

12:30.698 --> 12:33.200
You were like a dog and my mouth

12:33.267 --> 12:35.601
was like a bowl full of
dog... milk!

12:35.668 --> 12:37.069
It was like a damn fairy tale,
that kiss!

12:37.137 --> 12:38.871
It was the best kiss of your life.

12:38.938 --> 12:40.439
- Are you serious, Nick?
- And you have to take

12:40.507 --> 12:42.441
a little responsibility,
tarting around in that

12:42.509 --> 12:45.650
little soft pink robe, not expecting
to get kissed. - Tarting around?

12:45.678 --> 12:47.513
I'm a man, Jessica!

12:47.580 --> 12:49.715
- What?
- Pink robes are my catnip.

12:49.782 --> 12:51.549
And we have a winning couple!

12:51.617 --> 12:53.118
We are not a couple!

12:53.185 --> 12:55.520
- We're not a couple.
- And this is a very bad table.

12:55.587 --> 12:57.055
- Terrible table.
- And stop clapping, everybody.

12:57.123 --> 12:58.990
- This is awful.
- Look. It won't hold anything.

12:59.058 --> 13:01.159
Be prepared to laugh!

13:02.227 --> 13:03.561
No, I mean, this is, like...

13:03.629 --> 13:04.729
I got it, I got it.

13:04.796 --> 13:06.530
Here, put it down.
Just-- okay.

13:06.597 --> 13:08.999
Very weak table.

13:10.067 --> 13:11.134
Break!

13:12.703 --> 13:14.204
It's a strong table.

13:14.272 --> 13:16.440
Strong table, strong couple.

13:17.308 --> 13:19.076
Come on. Jump up, yeah.
Jump up! Jump up! Jump up!

13:19.144 --> 13:20.444
- Whoa! Come on.
- Wow.

13:20.512 --> 13:22.578
- Wow, yeah. It's real, man.
- Come on.

13:22.646 --> 13:23.812
That's an impressive table!

13:27.161 --> 13:29.995
Congratulations on winning the
table-building competition, baby.

13:29.996 --> 13:32.514
- Yeah, it didn't mean anything, so...
- I didn't think it meant anything.

13:32.515 --> 13:34.548
- Yeah, no, just--
- Nick just drives me crazy.

13:34.549 --> 13:37.284
- It's like-- you know?
- Yeah, I mean, I never...

13:37.352 --> 13:39.152
- Well, yeah, that's just...
- That's what I was saying.

13:39.220 --> 13:40.353
Is there something I should know here?

13:40.421 --> 13:42.155
No. 'Cause...

13:42.223 --> 13:43.023
Men, switch seats!

13:43.091 --> 13:44.424
No. Sam, stop.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.359
'Cause...
No, I want to talk to you.

13:46.427 --> 13:48.161
- Sam, I...
- Do you like field hockey?

13:48.229 --> 13:50.496
I... Yeah. Yeah.

13:52.934 --> 13:55.034
- Hi!
- Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetie. Pass.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.002
So, when did you decide
to become a model?

13:57.070 --> 13:59.504
Oh. Didn't really
think about it at all.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.173
Someone just said they'd pay me
for being pretty, so...

14:01.741 --> 14:03.542
- I like your hat.
- Shh.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.078
- It's my favorite color.
- Shh...

14:08.749 --> 14:10.581
- I didn't say anything.
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.

14:11.649 --> 14:12.383
So how many children do you want?

14:12.451 --> 14:15.754
Well, I have to start soon, so
I guess I'll just jump right in.

14:16.821 --> 14:18.556
So, do you think through
any of your decisions

14:18.624 --> 14:19.991
or do you always just
do whatever you want?

14:20.059 --> 14:22.093
Hey! M. Night Shyamalan.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.262
I got a twist ending Shut up.

14:24.329 --> 14:26.230
- What do you want, Table Seven?
- Schmidt, just talk to your girl.

14:26.297 --> 14:27.965
- Hi!
- You better watch it, buddy.

14:28.032 --> 14:29.767
'Cause I will, I will
Cal-cut-a-bitch up in here.

14:29.834 --> 14:32.136
- I will Cal-cut-a-bitch.
- Schmidt!

14:32.203 --> 14:33.937
Don't worry, Ben Affleck.
I'm not desperate.

14:34.005 --> 14:35.472
I don't date below Table Six.

14:35.539 --> 14:37.507
Time's up. Switch places.

14:37.575 --> 14:38.842
Sam...

14:40.945 --> 14:42.311
That was not nice.
He crossed a line.

14:42.379 --> 14:44.380
Schmidt, you said
you would leave me alone.

14:44.447 --> 14:45.681
- You said you would leave...
- He crossed a line.

14:45.749 --> 14:47.070
You said you would leave me alone.

14:51.354 --> 14:53.189
Funny seeing you here.

14:55.391 --> 14:56.491
Hey.

14:56.558 --> 14:57.859
You have to go.

14:57.927 --> 14:58.961
Yeah, you have to go over there.

14:59.228 --> 15:00.496
Okay. Bye-bye.

15:00.563 --> 15:02.063
Go now. Hi.

15:02.631 --> 15:05.867
Um, Sam, I do have
something to tell you.

15:07.536 --> 15:09.838
You know why we're at Table 34?

15:09.906 --> 15:13.239
'Cause we're both bad at life,
but we have model good looks.

15:13.442 --> 15:15.843
It's 'cause we don't
think things through.

15:15.911 --> 15:18.378
You didn't think it through
when you kissed Jess.

15:18.446 --> 15:21.748
She told me. It's like we just
make these impulsive decisions,

15:21.817 --> 15:24.651
and all we end up doing
is hurting other people.

15:26.888 --> 15:28.689
I can't believe this.

15:28.756 --> 15:29.790
No. No, Sam...

15:31.325 --> 15:33.326
Sam? Wait.

15:33.393 --> 15:34.327
Sam, wait.

15:34.394 --> 15:35.895
I'm really sorry.

15:35.963 --> 15:37.430
I said I wanted to commit to this.

15:37.497 --> 15:38.798
I thought you understood
what that meant.

15:38.866 --> 15:40.466
I do. I did.

15:40.534 --> 15:42.368
Hey, hey.
Sam, listen.

15:42.436 --> 15:43.703
- What?
- Sam, hear me out.

15:43.770 --> 15:45.338
I kissed her, okay?

15:45.405 --> 15:46.905
She didn't kiss me.

15:46.973 --> 15:49.174
It didn't mean anything to her.

15:49.242 --> 15:50.742
Thank you.

15:51.777 --> 15:53.545
Oh, my God!

15:53.612 --> 15:55.780
I'm sorry, Nick.
It's the training.

15:55.849 --> 15:57.449
He's in such terrible shape!
You could've killed him.

15:57.516 --> 15:58.717
I'm gonna kick your ass, man.

15:58.784 --> 16:00.219
Jess, it may not have meant something

16:00.286 --> 16:01.920
to you, but it meant something to me.

16:01.988 --> 16:04.722
Is there another doctor in the house?!

16:04.789 --> 16:06.390
With this crowd, I'm sure.

16:06.508 --> 16:09.043
I'm done. So...

16:10.412 --> 16:12.046
Good-bye, Jess.

16:12.114 --> 16:13.915
No. Sam.

16:16.218 --> 16:18.352
Ice it, 24 hours.

16:18.670 --> 16:20.687
And keep it elevated.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.457
- He even exits cool.
- Oh, God.

16:26.945 --> 16:29.945
Anu? I got
something for you.

16:30.013 --> 16:31.598
Now, this is Freddy.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.466
As you can see, he has the exact

16:33.535 --> 16:35.301
same build as me, all right?

16:35.369 --> 16:38.571
And he is totally available.
Ain't that right, Freddy?

16:38.639 --> 16:41.040
That is what I call an arranged bang.

16:42.943 --> 16:46.276
Freddy, are you scared of being
confined in small spaces?

16:49.349 --> 16:52.682
Oh, you'll do just fine.

16:53.402 --> 16:56.337
Now, just remember, wherever you are,

16:56.405 --> 16:58.472
the Mojo Man is there.

17:07.382 --> 17:09.616
Damn it, Schmidt.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.188
I'm taking this.

17:14.255 --> 17:17.588
Excuse me. Excuse me! Hold up!

17:17.925 --> 17:19.726
You know, when I came here today,

17:19.794 --> 17:21.761
I thought India was
a pretty cool country.

17:21.829 --> 17:23.297
You guys are obviously smart.

17:23.364 --> 17:25.763
You l-looked at the roof
of a bus and you said,

17:25.833 --> 17:28.300
"That's not just a roof,
that's more seating."

17:28.367 --> 17:31.701
Kal Penn, he's a genius.
Thank you for him.

17:31.805 --> 17:33.472
But what I didn't know

17:33.540 --> 17:36.175
is that you're a country
full of blind idiots.

17:36.243 --> 17:37.276
- Oh, God.
- Because in your midst

17:37.344 --> 17:39.911
walks a brown angel.

17:39.979 --> 17:41.813
That woman. Right there.

17:43.582 --> 17:45.150
I may be an idiot,

17:45.218 --> 17:47.285
but I'm smart enough
to know what I lost.

17:48.988 --> 17:50.722
You people could've had it all.

17:50.789 --> 17:53.624
And you shoved her over there
at a table with Nick.

17:54.594 --> 17:57.261
Get your crap together, India.

17:57.329 --> 17:59.263
Schmidt...

17:59.331 --> 18:01.265
out!

18:04.903 --> 18:07.905
Hello. I didn't
see you over here.

18:08.473 --> 18:09.673
I would love to...

18:10.976 --> 18:12.308
Sorry I didn't see you earlier.

18:12.376 --> 18:13.910
Okay.
They're all-- okay.

18:13.978 --> 18:15.511
You don't all have
to run over there at once.

18:15.579 --> 18:17.380
I mean, she... she's not
that great, you guys.

18:17.414 --> 18:19.883
I mean, she's kind of old.

18:19.950 --> 18:21.451
You should see her areolas--
one's like a helicopter pad,

18:21.519 --> 18:23.286
the other one's
like a, you know, like...

18:23.354 --> 18:24.588
like a tick bite.

18:24.655 --> 18:26.890
It's freaky. Very disorienting.

♪ It feels like a perfect night ♪

18:28.525 --> 18:30.393

♪ Oh, yeah ♪

18:46.007 --> 18:47.208
How's that?

18:47.276 --> 18:50.044
You know when you get dumped and
you're, like, racking your brain

18:50.112 --> 18:52.380
for what was it that I did wrong?

18:52.448 --> 18:54.315
Well, this is a really unique situation

18:54.383 --> 18:57.184
in that I don't have to do that.

18:57.252 --> 18:59.420
Well, what happened?

18:59.487 --> 19:02.188
I'm sorry. I know what--
I know that it's my fault.

19:02.256 --> 19:03.657
I didn't mean it like...

19:05.225 --> 19:06.660
Jess, can I say something

19:06.728 --> 19:09.362
that'll potentially not
help this situation? - No.

19:09.431 --> 19:11.998
I've never been
a home-wrecker.

19:12.566 --> 19:14.535
And I liked it.

19:14.602 --> 19:17.503
I mean, Sam was threatened by me.

19:18.539 --> 19:20.540
I mean, I see that as a victory.

19:23.075 --> 19:25.408
But in-in more important...

19:26.847 --> 19:31.680
uh, ways, a huge, huge,
devastating loss.

19:31.751 --> 19:32.517
For you.

19:34.053 --> 19:34.986
Should I call Cece?

19:35.054 --> 19:36.120
This feels like Cece territory.

19:36.188 --> 19:37.622
This isn't Nick territory.

19:37.690 --> 19:38.590
This is, uh...

19:41.527 --> 19:43.361
Look, Jess...

19:45.130 --> 19:47.465
I'm sorry, okay,

19:47.532 --> 19:48.999
that I kissed you.

19:49.067 --> 19:50.568
But I shouldn't have done it,

19:50.635 --> 19:52.235
because it was obviously a mistake,

19:52.303 --> 19:54.404
and now you're crying and...

19:54.473 --> 19:56.874
I won't do it again.

19:58.342 --> 20:00.210
Well...

20:00.278 --> 20:04.611
maybe it was a little bit broken
to begin with.

20:04.882 --> 20:06.683
- What happened?
- He just...

20:06.750 --> 20:09.819
He always wanted
to fist bump in the morning.

20:09.887 --> 20:13.089
- And you didn't like that?
- I hated it. What are... what...

20:13.156 --> 20:15.358
- I feel like you're forgiving me.
- No.

20:15.425 --> 20:17.794
I felt like before I said that
you were though. - Nope. Nope.

20:17.862 --> 20:20.095
Now you remembered you're
still mad at me. No? Okay.

20:20.162 --> 20:21.997
- All right, good night, Nick. Night.
- Okay, good night, Jess.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.431
Hey, Jess.

20:24.933 --> 20:25.667
Too soon?

20:25.735 --> 20:27.536
Yeah, too soon!

20:27.604 --> 20:30.005
Well, hey, good night.
And I'm sorry about everything.

20:30.072 --> 20:31.172
Okay.

20:38.814 --> 20:40.147
Okay, yeah.

20:40.215 --> 20:41.616
- That was...
- Yeah. That was...

20:41.683 --> 20:42.804
- a little bit weird.
- So weird.

20:42.818 --> 20:44.018
Let's not ever do that again.

20:44.085 --> 20:45.853
- Yeah.
- Do it again. Okay.

20:45.921 --> 20:47.722
- Good night. Night, Miller!
- Good night.

20:48.489 --> 20:49.456
Good night, Sergeant.

20:51.926 --> 20:54.528
I'm glad everything's
back to normal around here.

20:58.665 --> 21:00.098
Thank you for what you said up there.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.967
You know, I got a lot
of phone numbers. - Good.

21:03.035 --> 21:04.169
I think I'm gonna go on a lot of dates.

21:04.237 --> 21:06.071
I think that's a great thing.
Good. - Yeah.

21:08.139 --> 21:09.997
The plan hasn't changed;
I am still marrying an Indian guy.

21:09.998 --> 21:10.996
- No, yeah, that's fine.
- Okay?

21:10.997 --> 21:13.412
But you went home with a Jew in
a turban, so I'm just saying.

21:13.479 --> 21:14.959
Just take this off.
Come on. Let's go.

21:16.448 --> 21:18.983
God, I have missed this.

21:21.319 --> 21:22.887
Turban on? Turban off?

21:22.955 --> 21:24.923
I'm gonna hate myself
for saying this, but...

21:25.190 --> 21:26.658
turban on.

21:26.725 --> 21:28.092
- Turban on it is.
- Uh-uh

21:32.160 --> 21:33.427
Taking that magic carpet ride.

21:33.495 --> 21:36.228
- Yeah? No?
- Shut up! Whoo!
