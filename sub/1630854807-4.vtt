WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:06.789
It wouldn't be enough
to cover the entire recall,

00:06.789 --> 00:07.920
but we could stop
using the corporate jets

00:07.920 --> 00:09.531
for non-company business.

00:09.531 --> 00:10.880
We do that now?

00:10.880 --> 00:13.665
Well, some people take
"market research" trips

00:13.665 --> 00:14.971
to every Mardi Gras.

00:14.971 --> 00:17.060
Uh, bullying?
Anyone want to step in here?

00:17.060 --> 00:18.583
Mm-mm.

00:18.583 --> 00:19.671
Couldn't we just charge,
like, 50 bucks more a car?

00:19.671 --> 00:20.759
No one would notice.

00:20.759 --> 00:21.934
Yes, people famously
don't haggle

00:21.934 --> 00:23.501
over the prices of their cars.

00:23.501 --> 00:24.502
None of that is big enough.

00:24.502 --> 00:26.287
We have been at this for hours,

00:26.287 --> 00:28.332
and all we've decided
is where to order lunch.

00:28.332 --> 00:29.899
We should have spent
more time on that.

00:29.899 --> 00:31.074
This sandwich dry as hell.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.467
Look, I hate to be
the one to say it,

00:32.467 --> 00:34.469
but we all know
what needs to be done.

00:34.469 --> 00:36.906
We have to close a factory.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.603
I said I hate to say it,
all right?

00:38.603 --> 00:39.691
That absolves me.

00:39.691 --> 00:40.910
I really don't want
to do that.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.129
None of us do, but sometimes

00:42.129 --> 00:43.739
you have to cut off the hand
to save the arm.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.088
Ah, like zombies.

00:45.088 --> 00:46.307
Why are factory workers
always the first ones

00:46.307 --> 00:47.525
on the chopping block?
- Mm.

00:47.525 --> 00:48.744
Nothing ever seems
to touch the people

00:48.744 --> 00:50.006
with the cushy office jobs.

00:50.006 --> 00:51.703
You know what?
That is not a bad point.

00:51.703 --> 00:53.270
I mean, it'd be a bloodbath
up here,

00:53.270 --> 00:55.272
but downsizing executives
would get us a lot more savings

00:55.272 --> 00:56.534
with fewer bodies.

00:56.534 --> 00:57.535
No, I wasn't suggesting
that we actually--

00:57.535 --> 00:58.754
You know, I hate to say it,

00:58.754 --> 01:00.147
but we wouldn't have to
cut production

01:00.147 --> 01:01.800
if we went with
Jack's Red Wedding thing.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.106
Okay, Red Wedding is not
what I was actually saying.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.368
- We shouldn't fire anyone.
- Exactly.

01:04.368 --> 01:05.674
But if we have to,

01:05.674 --> 01:07.154
we would get less blowback
with Jack's idea.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.372
And then we could
loosen restrictions

01:08.372 --> 01:09.460
on the corporate jet, right?

01:09.460 --> 01:11.027
What is wrong with you,
Wesley?

01:11.027 --> 01:12.898
These people 'bout to be
homeless and lose their jobs,

01:12.898 --> 01:14.552
and you're worried about
seeing boobs for free?

01:14.552 --> 01:17.207
It's not free.
It's like a barter economy.

01:17.207 --> 01:18.426
Okay, fine.
We'll go with Jack's idea.

01:18.426 --> 01:19.731
Let' start
with every department,

01:19.731 --> 01:20.863
letting one executive go,

01:20.863 --> 01:22.256
and then we'll reassess
from there.

01:22.256 --> 01:25.128
Oh, God. They have no idea
what's coming.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.390
Stop staring.
You're making it obvious.

01:26.390 --> 01:27.522
Pretend I said something inspiring.

01:27.522 --> 01:29.654
Clap, clap, clap, clap.
- Oh, bravo.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.265
But wait, wait, wait,
no, no, no, no.

01:31.265 --> 01:33.528
It looks like we decided to
fire them and then applauded.

01:33.528 --> 01:34.616
Just close the blinds;
close the blinds.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.096
Yes. On it.
Closing the blinds.

01:37.401 --> 01:38.924
<i>♪ Bom bom
bom-bom-bom-bom-bom ♪</i>

01:38.924 --> 01:41.449
<i>♪ Buh buh bom-bom-bom
buh bom-bom-bom-bom ♪</i>

01:44.408 --> 01:46.715
I mean,
Ros is a cancer survivor.

01:46.715 --> 01:48.586
If we let go of her,
she'll lose her insurance.

01:48.586 --> 01:50.284
And Keith just adopted twins.

01:50.284 --> 01:52.155
I mean, that's a bad time
to be out of a job.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.114
I didn't mean
to get anybody fired.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.419
Who would you let go of?

01:55.419 --> 01:57.073
I mean, I have narrowed it down
to these four.

01:57.073 --> 01:58.466
- You want me to decide?
- Well, yeah.

01:58.466 --> 01:59.728
You want to be in management?

01:59.728 --> 02:01.730
Here's lesson 101:
making hard decisions.

02:01.730 --> 02:03.123
Well, our first lesson
was actually

02:03.123 --> 02:04.211
how to log into the web portal.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.386
It's, like,
needlessly complicated--

02:05.386 --> 02:07.562
Right.
I need this.

02:07.562 --> 02:08.563
Fine.

02:08.563 --> 02:10.913
If I had to choose, I guess...

02:10.913 --> 02:12.175
Syd.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.611
He has the worst numbers
and the most complaints.

02:13.611 --> 02:14.786
Yeah.
Sweet guy, though.

02:14.786 --> 02:15.961
I was hoping
you wouldn't pick him.

02:15.961 --> 02:17.137
Oh, I can pick somebody--

02:17.137 --> 02:18.616
No, you're right.
It has to be Syd.

02:18.616 --> 02:20.096
I just can't face him.
- Okay.

02:20.096 --> 02:21.576
Can you do it?

02:21.576 --> 02:22.533
Me?

02:22.533 --> 02:23.969
It'd hurt less
coming from you.

02:23.969 --> 02:25.623
These people think of me
as like a cool, younger sister

02:25.623 --> 02:28.496
or like an unobtainable crush.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.454
- Do they?
- Mm-hmm.

02:30.454 --> 02:32.021
Ah, there she is.

02:32.021 --> 02:34.850
Saint Dori saving the world
one mean comment at a time.

02:34.850 --> 02:36.112
Get away from me, Wesley.

02:36.112 --> 02:37.287
She's so perfect.

02:37.287 --> 02:38.810
She would never
spend company money

02:38.810 --> 02:39.898
going to a place where

02:39.898 --> 02:41.639
sexual mores
are temporarily lowered.

02:41.639 --> 02:44.773
- Because I don't need to.
- Okay, uh, Miss Pens.

02:44.773 --> 02:46.644
God, for someone who cares
so much about the company,

02:46.644 --> 02:48.211
you're pretty cavalier
with the pen usage.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.822
You got blue, black, red,
another blue.

02:50.822 --> 02:51.910
Must be nice.

02:51.910 --> 02:52.955
What does a pen cost?

02:52.955 --> 02:54.043
Like, what?
A dime?

02:54.043 --> 02:55.044
Yeah, but you multiply that

02:55.044 --> 02:56.654
times, like, 20,000 employees,

02:56.654 --> 02:58.003
who knows how much
that would save?

02:58.003 --> 02:59.222
$2,000.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.006
Did you just do that
in your head?

03:01.006 --> 03:02.399
I mean, I guess we do
use a lot of stuff

03:02.399 --> 03:03.792
that we actually don't need.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.489
Like, why does everybody
have tape on their desk?

03:05.489 --> 03:06.969
We're not doing arts and crafts
up in here.

03:06.969 --> 03:08.275
Yeah.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.928
I mean, you cut some pens;
you cut some tape.

03:09.928 --> 03:12.757
- That's, like, pure savings.
- Yeah.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.237
Let's go check out
the supply room.

03:14.237 --> 03:17.414
Ooh, yeah.
Uh, don't worry, guys.

03:17.414 --> 03:20.461
This mismatched pair of ragtags
is gonna save your jobs.

03:20.461 --> 03:22.158
And in the process,

03:22.158 --> 03:25.553
we just may find out we have
more in common than we think.

03:25.553 --> 03:27.511
What does he mean
save our jobs?

03:27.511 --> 03:30.035
Anyone know what he means
by that?

03:30.035 --> 03:31.689
Hey, Katherine.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.822
"Ticker Tape" on CNBC wants to
interview you this afternoon.

03:33.822 --> 03:34.953
- Today?
- Mm.

03:34.953 --> 03:36.216
On the day of these layoffs?
Pass.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.521
I mean, that would be like

03:37.521 --> 03:39.871
taking a victory lap
at a euthanasia party.

03:39.871 --> 03:40.872
- Mm.
- Yeah.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.265
Not a perfect metaphor.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.658
But the point is,
terrible timing.

03:43.658 --> 03:45.442
Right, yeah,
but I was also thinking

03:45.442 --> 03:47.096
maybe it's perfect timing.
- Hmm?

03:47.096 --> 03:50.142
It shows that we're taking
hard actions to cut costs,

03:50.142 --> 03:52.797
which Wall Street will love,
but we're doing it by

03:52.797 --> 03:55.409
letting go of executives
instead of blue-collar workers,

03:55.409 --> 03:57.237
which, I mean,
Main Street will love.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.368
- Yeah.
- Oh, right?

03:58.368 --> 03:59.587
Interesting.
Love from both streets.

03:59.587 --> 04:00.936
I mean, that's
all the streets there are.

04:00.936 --> 04:02.285
Yeah.

04:02.285 --> 04:04.287
Katherine Hastings,
savior of the underlings.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.246
Maybe we could
workshop the phrasing.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.812
Savior of the peons?

04:07.812 --> 04:09.466
Uh, just workers.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.947
Eh, doesn't really pop.
I'll play with it.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.340
Right.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.471
So the first few pages

04:14.471 --> 04:15.951
are just
the standard layoff script,

04:15.951 --> 04:19.259
and the rest is a list
of acceptable legal responses

04:19.259 --> 04:20.521
to anything they may say
to you.

04:20.521 --> 04:22.479
So I'm just supposed
to read this to them?

04:22.479 --> 04:23.741
Seems a little heartless.

04:23.741 --> 04:25.047
Precisely, yeah.
Just get through it

04:25.047 --> 04:27.136
with an emotionless,
surgical precision.

04:27.136 --> 04:29.747
You know, like a child
of an acrimonious divorce

04:29.747 --> 04:31.314
dissecting a backyard squirrel.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.751
Please, Jack.
There's an art to this.

04:33.751 --> 04:36.014
People don't want a robot.
They want to be heard.

04:36.014 --> 04:38.147
They want to be seen.
- Just stick to the script.

04:38.147 --> 04:39.322
Stick to the script,

04:39.322 --> 04:41.846
but breathe some life into it, hmm?

04:41.846 --> 04:43.239
Connect with your
scene partner.

04:43.239 --> 04:45.110
- My scene partner?
- Let's say I'm firing you.

04:45.110 --> 04:48.070
I gotta ask myself, "What
do I think makes Jack tick?"

04:48.070 --> 04:50.768
So while my mouth may be
going through the motions

04:50.768 --> 04:53.467
and saying the words,
my mind is thinking,

04:53.467 --> 04:55.599
"Light beer, bouncing breasts,

04:55.599 --> 04:57.645
he probably ain't
cracked a book in ages."

04:57.645 --> 05:00.125
- Little condescending, but--
- It's art, Jack.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.780
It's supposed to make you
feel uncomfortable.

05:02.780 --> 05:05.435
Yeah, I mean, you have
to admit we do love breasts.

05:05.435 --> 05:06.828
He's not wrong about that.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.308
Okay, but what do I do
if he, like,

05:08.308 --> 05:10.353
starts freaking out screaming,
"I'm gonna kill myself,"

05:10.353 --> 05:12.573
or, "I'm gonna kill you and
then I'm gonna kill myself."

05:12.573 --> 05:14.401
What do I do if--
- That is in here,

05:14.401 --> 05:15.619
because we do get that...

05:15.619 --> 05:17.447
Really quite a lot.

05:17.447 --> 05:19.623
Uh, oh, we could
lower our water bill

05:19.623 --> 05:21.625
if we put those little
push tabs on the sinks.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.061
You know, the one where
you gotta play whack-a-mole

05:23.061 --> 05:24.149
to, like, turn the water on?

05:24.149 --> 05:25.412
Oh, my God.
I hate those things.

05:25.412 --> 05:26.630
That's perfect.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.371
Oh, double-sided printing.

05:28.371 --> 05:29.807
We use half the paper,
not to mention

05:29.807 --> 05:31.853
freeing up filing space
and reducing trash.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.594
Okay, you're amazing at this.

05:33.594 --> 05:36.248
It's like "Good Will Hunting"
but, you know, like,

05:36.248 --> 05:37.772
a reboot with a Black woman,

05:37.772 --> 05:39.339
and I'd probably have to be gay
or British or something.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.470
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.472
Joe America
shouldn't pay the tab

05:42.472 --> 05:44.387
for corporate America's
mistakes.

05:44.387 --> 05:45.606
Powerful, right?

05:45.606 --> 05:47.347
Very much so.
I felt it. Tingly.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.478
Ew.
Well, anyway.

05:48.478 --> 05:49.871
Hey, is what I'm wearing okay?

05:49.871 --> 05:50.828
When I got dressed
this morning,

05:50.828 --> 05:52.134
I didn't know I'd be doing TV.

05:52.134 --> 05:53.309
I think you look perfect,

05:53.309 --> 05:54.397
Especially given
the solemn news,

05:54.397 --> 05:56.312
it's good not to be
too polished.

05:56.312 --> 05:57.661
What do you mean
too polished?

05:57.661 --> 05:59.097
Do I look unpolished?
- No, I just mean real.

05:59.097 --> 06:00.490
You look real.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.057
So I don't look like
my normal supermodel self?

06:02.057 --> 06:03.363
It's been a stressful time lately

06:03.363 --> 06:04.451
in case you haven't noticed.

06:04.451 --> 06:05.843
Honestly?
Hey, you look beautiful.

06:05.843 --> 06:07.062
Really?
'Cause ten seconds ago,

06:07.062 --> 06:08.759
you were saying
I looked unpolished,

06:08.759 --> 06:10.195
so you're kinda talking out
both sides of your mouth there.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.677
Oh, yeah.
My roots are really bad. Wow.

06:13.677 --> 06:15.331
Ooh, I could use some filler, too.

06:15.331 --> 06:16.332
I'm gonna go.

06:16.332 --> 06:17.855
Oh, my God.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.596
Hey, Dori.
Get Dr. Kazemi on the phone.

06:19.596 --> 06:21.468
Tell her to bring the full bag!

06:21.468 --> 06:23.600
Syd, you've been
a valuable employee,

06:23.600 --> 06:25.689
but unfortunately,
we have to let some people go,

06:25.689 --> 06:26.864
and I just--

06:26.864 --> 06:28.257
Yes, uh, come in.

06:28.257 --> 06:29.824
- Hey, are you Jack?
- Syd!

06:29.824 --> 06:30.825
I mean, I'm Jack.
- Yeah.

06:30.825 --> 06:31.782
- You're Syd.
- Yeah.

06:31.782 --> 06:33.131
Well, I certainly hope so.

06:33.131 --> 06:34.785
That's the name that they wrote
in my underwear.

06:34.785 --> 06:37.048
You know,
you look like a Jack.

06:37.048 --> 06:39.703
Yeah, it's a strong name,
but it's not showing off.

06:39.703 --> 06:42.097
I mean, you're just Jack.
- Yeah, thanks.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.881
So the reason
I asked you in today

06:43.881 --> 06:45.056
is that we need to talk about--

06:45.056 --> 06:47.319
Actually,
Jack's my grandson's name.

06:47.319 --> 06:49.539
- That's, uh, that's cool.
- You remind me of him.

06:49.539 --> 06:52.890
He's a good kid.
That's two good kids.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.414
So what can I do for you, Jack?

06:57.155 --> 06:58.156
- Syd.
- Yeah.

06:58.156 --> 06:59.767
- You've been a valuable--
- Oh!

06:59.767 --> 07:01.464
What size mitt do you wear?

07:01.464 --> 07:02.900
My mitt size?

07:02.900 --> 07:05.381
I've got an extra glove.
I think it might fit you.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.165
- Adult?
- Yeah, that'll work.

07:08.906 --> 07:09.907
Yeah.

07:12.257 --> 07:14.608
"Please know
that Payne greatly values

07:14.608 --> 07:16.087
"your years of service
and is therefore committed

07:16.087 --> 07:18.350
to helping you find your next
employment opportunity."

07:18.350 --> 07:20.875
Oh, my God.
Oh, God. I--

07:20.875 --> 07:22.398
"Payne--

07:22.398 --> 07:24.444
Payne will be offering
a generous severance package"--

07:28.404 --> 07:30.754
"Payne greatly values
your years..."

07:30.754 --> 07:32.713
I'm sorry, Deb.

07:32.713 --> 07:37.935
"Your years of service and
is committed to helping you..."

07:37.935 --> 07:41.417
Shh, it's okay.
You're doing great.

07:41.417 --> 07:44.028
"Unfortunately, we have
to let some people go, and..."

07:44.028 --> 07:45.639
Oh, I'm sorry.
Who's that gonna be?

07:45.639 --> 07:48.990
Uh, just, uh,
let me keep reading.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.208
"We have to let
some people go"--

07:50.208 --> 07:51.906
On second thought,
I don't wanna know.

07:51.906 --> 07:53.081
These people are like family.

07:53.081 --> 07:54.212
There's a second half
of that sentence

07:54.212 --> 07:55.997
I really need to get to, Syd.

07:55.997 --> 07:57.477
"Please..."

07:57.477 --> 07:58.913
"Please take all personal
belongings with you..."

08:00.567 --> 08:01.785
"By the end of the day,

08:01.785 --> 08:04.571
as your card access
will be turned off."

08:05.702 --> 08:07.748
"Please take
all your personal..."

08:07.748 --> 08:08.923
No!

08:08.923 --> 08:10.490
I can't. I can't.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.926
Here. I'll help.
Let me do it.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.582
Uh, "Take all
personal belongings with you

08:15.582 --> 08:18.541
as your card access
will be turned off."

08:18.541 --> 08:20.369
That sounds reasonable.
That's fine.

08:20.369 --> 08:22.240
Turn the page.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.764
Wait!
I'm fired?

08:23.764 --> 08:25.113
You're firing me?

08:25.113 --> 08:27.071
Uh, "If you signed
a separation agreement,

08:27.071 --> 08:29.204
I can give you a severance
of X dollars."

08:29.204 --> 08:30.771
I think I'm supposed
to fill out the X--

08:30.771 --> 08:33.251
I could do better, Jack.
Jack, give me another chance.

08:33.251 --> 08:35.123
"Syd, I'm sorry,
but the decision

08:35.123 --> 08:36.298
to end your employment
is final."

08:36.298 --> 08:38.692
Oh!
How is this happening?

08:38.692 --> 08:40.171
And what sort of God

08:40.171 --> 08:42.173
would allow something like this
to happen?

08:42.173 --> 08:43.610
"If they invoke God,

08:43.610 --> 08:45.525
maintain a neutral disposition,
and do not engage."

08:47.178 --> 08:49.224
I don't think
you're supposed to read that.

08:49.224 --> 08:54.185
"Once again, thank you
for your time and service."

08:54.185 --> 08:55.883
Howard?
Are you all right?

08:55.883 --> 08:57.058
I'm fine.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.583
"Excellent.

09:00.583 --> 09:04.065
I'm so happy we've come
to a satisfactory conclusion."

09:05.370 --> 09:07.634
Howard, are you sure
you're fine?

09:07.634 --> 09:09.636
I'm fine.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.551
"Excellent.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.640
I'm so happy we've come
to a satisfactory conclusion."

09:13.640 --> 09:16.164
Shall I--I tell you what,

09:16.164 --> 09:17.165
why don't I give you
a helping hand,

09:17.165 --> 09:19.210
set you on the way?

09:19.210 --> 09:21.343
You know, a journey
of a thousand miles

09:21.343 --> 09:23.475
starts with a single step,
doesn't it?

09:23.475 --> 09:28.306
So I'm just gonna
pop you there, and, um...

09:28.306 --> 09:31.135
check you on the flipside.

09:31.135 --> 09:32.441
What did I do wrong?

09:32.441 --> 09:34.138
Did someone complain
about my performance?

09:34.138 --> 09:35.923
"Syd, we won't be
discussing any specifics

09:35.923 --> 09:37.054
about your performance."
- Okay.

09:37.054 --> 09:38.752
But to my face they say,
"Great job, Syd.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.536
You're part of the team, Syd."
So now what?

09:40.536 --> 09:42.843
All of a sudden, behind
my back, they want me gone?

09:42.843 --> 09:44.627
"Syd, this meeting
isn't about other employees."

09:44.627 --> 09:46.411
Stop reading
from this binder.

09:46.411 --> 09:49.850
I'm a real person.
Would you talk to me?

09:51.634 --> 09:53.984
Truth is, we have to cut costs
to pay for the recall.

09:53.984 --> 09:55.986
That's all this is.
- But why me?

09:55.986 --> 09:57.553
Did I do my job wrong?

09:57.553 --> 09:59.381
Is that what this is
in my file?

09:59.381 --> 10:01.383
Of course not.
Of course not.

10:01.383 --> 10:04.212
The file says you are great.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.606
They just want, like,
new blood.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.086
- New blood?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:09.086 --> 10:11.045
Syd, it's nothing personal.

10:11.045 --> 10:13.961
Oh, okay.
So this is an age thing.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.310
What?

10:15.310 --> 10:16.659
No, you need to bring in
the young guns.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.313
I didn't mean to suggest
anything like that.

10:18.313 --> 10:19.749
I may be old, but I know the
word "ageism" when I hear it.

10:19.749 --> 10:20.707
- Syd, let's just take a beat.
- Let's just work--

10:20.707 --> 10:21.838
You don't remind me
of my grandson,

10:21.838 --> 10:23.884
you remind me
of my other grandson,

10:23.884 --> 10:26.321
the pot smoker.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.673
So how rough
have the layoffs been?

10:30.673 --> 10:32.588
Um, you know,
we're getting through it.

10:32.588 --> 10:35.504
It's just obviously uncomfortable.

10:35.504 --> 10:36.679
Mm-hmm.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.594
- Should I come back later?
- No. Why?

10:38.594 --> 10:40.596
Just a bit squeamish
about needles in faces.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.337
Oh, well, you're
gonna have to get used to that.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.165
I mean, you're
a female executive, right?

10:44.165 --> 10:45.775
Gotta stay ahead
of the saggy-faced curve.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.298
Mm.

10:47.298 --> 10:48.343
Actually, you could use
a little touch-up right now.

10:48.343 --> 10:49.431
You want the rest
of this needle?

10:49.431 --> 10:50.693
- You can't share needles.
- What?

10:50.693 --> 10:51.868
It's fine. I'm her boss.
- I think I'm good.

10:51.868 --> 10:53.435
But thanks.
- Easier if you start now.

10:53.435 --> 10:55.437
Actually, maybe five years ago.
- Mm-hmm.

10:55.437 --> 10:57.221
You're the head
of a Fortune 500 company.

10:57.221 --> 10:58.658
Haven't you, like,

10:58.658 --> 11:00.747
earned the right to not have
to worry about vanity?

11:00.747 --> 11:03.532
It's not vanity; it's business.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.012
I mean,

11:05.012 --> 11:06.709
people want their female CEOs
to be young and vibrant.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.232
Do you think anyone
wants to know that

11:08.232 --> 11:09.277
when I kicked through
the glass ceiling,

11:09.277 --> 11:10.887
I peed my granny briefs
a little?

11:10.887 --> 11:12.759
Mm, no.
Is that a thing?

11:12.759 --> 11:14.586
Oh, yeah.
When you hit perimenopause,

11:14.586 --> 11:16.676
you'll be playing tennis
in a maxi pad, too.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.416
- Well, I don't play tennis.
- You should.

11:18.416 --> 11:19.548
Your upper arms are starting
to drift a little.

11:19.548 --> 11:20.680
It's really good for that.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.377
- And stop moving your lips.
- Mm-hmm.

11:22.377 --> 11:23.465
I mean,
this is what you have to do

11:23.465 --> 11:25.032
to be taken seriously.

11:25.032 --> 11:26.424
Mm.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.644
Hey, everyone!
We got great news.

11:28.644 --> 11:31.386
Dori is passing out some
super-cozy blankets.

11:31.386 --> 11:32.779
Those are gratis.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.085
Plus, I also think she has
some bonus great news.

11:35.085 --> 11:36.565
I sure do, Wesley.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.480
The heat will be turned off
between 10:00 and 4:00,

11:38.480 --> 11:39.829
effective immediately.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.788
And that's prudent.
It's super-prudent.

11:41.788 --> 11:44.921
Um, I can't work in the cold.
I have a medical condition.

11:44.921 --> 11:47.663
- You have a what?
- An iron deficiency.

11:47.663 --> 11:50.535
So let me guess.
You half woman, half lizard?

11:50.535 --> 11:52.320
No, no, it's cool. It's cool.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.625
We want everyone
to be comfortable,

11:53.625 --> 11:54.801
so look, hey, look.
It's fine.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.454
Phoebe doesn't want
to use a blanket.

11:56.454 --> 11:57.673
- Okay.
- Great.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.109
Unfortunately, that does mean

11:59.109 --> 12:00.763
that Max is gonna lose his job

12:00.763 --> 12:03.505
and his kids are gonna
starve to death.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.202
Yeah,
Max's children gon' die.

12:05.202 --> 12:06.900
Okay, I'll take a blanket.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.205
There you go, Pheebs!

12:08.205 --> 12:10.077
Okay, Max. Your kids
live to see another day.

12:10.077 --> 12:12.383
I'm take this. You don't need
to be taping nothing.

12:12.383 --> 12:14.168
Your papers just be everywhere.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.912
Hey.
How'd everything go?

12:18.912 --> 12:20.304
Oh, fantastic. Yeah.

12:20.304 --> 12:21.741
I mean, I do have

12:21.741 --> 12:23.699
a catatonic man in a rolling
chair outside my office,

12:23.699 --> 12:26.354
but other than that,
everything's brilliant.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.617
Okay.
How did Syd take it?

12:28.617 --> 12:31.663
Not well. Kept asking why
he was the one being let go.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.056
He's the worst performer
in his department.

12:33.056 --> 12:34.405
Yeah, but I didn't want
to tell him that, though.

12:34.405 --> 12:36.712
He thinks it's because
he getting old.

12:36.712 --> 12:39.019
He can't sue me for, like,
ageism, can he?

12:39.019 --> 12:40.368
Uh, no.
Of course not.

12:40.368 --> 12:41.935
I mean theoretically,
he could sue the company,

12:41.935 --> 12:45.329
but he'd need to prove a
pattern of age discrimination.

12:45.329 --> 12:46.722
He's just one guy, so...

12:46.722 --> 12:48.811
I think Deborah's in her 60s, actually.

12:48.811 --> 12:51.335
All right, well, you know,
two people, then.

12:53.033 --> 12:56.558
Although Howard
is getting up there a bit.

12:56.558 --> 12:57.689
Well,
that's just three people.

12:57.689 --> 13:00.083
I'm sure other departments
didn't--

13:00.083 --> 13:01.345
Letting you go too?

13:01.345 --> 13:02.477
Ugh.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.785
Looks like the end
of "Cocoon," right?

13:05.785 --> 13:06.873
Mm.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.528
Gerald Balmer,

13:10.528 --> 13:11.965
Arthur Stevens, Mort Callaway?

13:11.965 --> 13:13.140
Jesus, this thing reads like

13:13.140 --> 13:15.229
the team roster
at a canasta tournament.

13:15.229 --> 13:16.839
Well, yeah, I mean,
if you read them out in a list,

13:16.839 --> 13:18.145
then yeah,
it doesn't sound great.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.581
Well, how should I read it?

13:19.581 --> 13:21.713
Well, I guess my legal advice
would be we don't.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.063
Can't we just wait this out?

13:23.063 --> 13:24.368
Like until
the old people die?

13:24.368 --> 13:25.717
No, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

13:25.717 --> 13:26.936
Guys, we can't sit back
on this one.

13:26.936 --> 13:28.111
I have dealt with

13:28.111 --> 13:29.330
age discrimination lawsuits
at York.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.158
They are ugly,
and they are expensive.

13:31.158 --> 13:32.333
Yeah, it's not like
the people they protect.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.857
They move pretty fast.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.554
It's not the time for humor,
is it?

13:36.554 --> 13:38.252
Yeah, but this wasn't
on purpose, though.

13:38.252 --> 13:39.296
It was a mistake.

13:39.296 --> 13:40.471
Oh, that's a good point, Jack.

13:40.471 --> 13:41.951
Yeah, great.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.431
Hey guys, let's double down
on the oopsies defense.

13:43.431 --> 13:45.694
I actually got excited when
you said "good point."

13:45.694 --> 13:47.217
This is all ridiculous.

13:47.217 --> 13:50.525
Syd is a marketing VP
who never learned social media.

13:50.525 --> 13:51.874
I mean, you would not

13:51.874 --> 13:53.093
go to a doctor who's
20 years behind the times.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.399
Right. Can it really
be discrimination

13:55.399 --> 13:56.748
if it affects your job?

13:56.748 --> 14:00.143
Are we gonna let
an 80-year-old, um...

14:00.143 --> 14:01.405
I don't know.
Can't help you.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.407
- Uh, run a band saw?
- Mm.

14:03.407 --> 14:04.495
That'd be insane.

14:04.495 --> 14:05.670
There should be lawsuits
about that.

14:05.670 --> 14:06.889
Yeah, I don't see

14:06.889 --> 14:08.412
a lot of heavy machinery
around the office.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.893
What about a hand model
who loses both of his hands?

14:10.893 --> 14:12.590
Again,
how does that apply to us?

14:12.590 --> 14:15.028
Yeah, also all models are
freelance these days, Jack,

14:15.028 --> 14:16.246
so that doesn't work
on two counts.

14:16.246 --> 14:17.857
Age had nothing to do
with this.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.641
It just so happens
that bad employees

14:19.641 --> 14:22.296
and old employees share
a lot of the same qualities,

14:22.296 --> 14:24.428
and that sounds really bad,
so circle back to me.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.256
Look, we didn't fire anyone
because of their age, right?

14:26.256 --> 14:27.562
We fired them
because they're bad.

14:27.562 --> 14:29.172
Yeah, yeah.
Thank you.

14:29.172 --> 14:31.087
You know, and some of them
are bad because of their age.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.654
Guys, I don't want excuses.

14:32.654 --> 14:34.134
I want to squash this thing
before it gets out of hand,

14:34.134 --> 14:36.832
so someone talk Syd
down off the ledge, okay?

14:36.832 --> 14:38.225
Straighten him out,
sweet talk him,

14:38.225 --> 14:39.443
give him a stick and let him

14:39.443 --> 14:41.184
push a big hula hoop
out the front door.

14:41.184 --> 14:42.882
I don't care.
Just end it.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.100
Mm-hmm.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.930
Oh, hey.
What are you doing?

14:47.930 --> 14:49.932
Did you just throw out
that tea bag?

14:49.932 --> 14:51.455
How many times
have you used it?

14:51.455 --> 14:52.848
- Uh, one.
- One?

14:52.848 --> 14:54.110
That's [bleep] up.

14:54.110 --> 14:55.851
Hey, hey! Everybody, listen up!

14:55.851 --> 14:57.505
Tea bags cost money!

14:57.505 --> 14:59.420
You should be getting
three to six uses

14:59.420 --> 15:00.900
per bag minimum.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.205
Yeah, after a few uses,

15:02.205 --> 15:04.381
I put some of the leaves
right under my tongue.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.253
- Ooh!
- Nature's tea bag!

15:06.253 --> 15:07.384
Right here!

15:07.384 --> 15:08.951
This is an industrious man, okay?

15:08.951 --> 15:10.213
Unlike you freaks.

15:10.213 --> 15:13.869
And just remember,
wastefulness is weak tea.

15:13.869 --> 15:14.957
Mm!

15:14.957 --> 15:16.741
That's been in the trash.

15:16.741 --> 15:17.873
Did you just come up
with that?

15:17.873 --> 15:19.440
It popped in my head
fully formed.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.658
Oh, my God. The hairs on
my neck just, like, stood up.

15:20.658 --> 15:22.486
- You serious?
- I was like, "Damn, Wesley!"

15:22.486 --> 15:24.793
Syd, I'm so sorry
to let you go.

15:24.793 --> 15:25.881
I just wanted to let you know

15:25.881 --> 15:26.926
it has nothing to do
with your age.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.275
Oh, really?

15:28.275 --> 15:30.277
Each department
had to lose one employee,

15:30.277 --> 15:31.887
and you had the worst numbers.

15:31.887 --> 15:32.975
Well, that's not
what Jack said.

15:32.975 --> 15:35.543
He said my file looks great

15:35.543 --> 15:39.547
and that you wanted me fired
because you wanted "new blood."

15:39.547 --> 15:40.722
Mm.
You said that?

15:40.722 --> 15:41.897
You could have mentioned
that before.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.464
I was trying
not to hurt his feelings.

15:43.464 --> 15:44.247
Look, Syd. I think what's
happened here is that Jack,

15:44.247 --> 15:45.988
he's a nice guy, you know?

15:45.988 --> 15:47.772
Not one of those
self-proclaimed nice guys

15:47.772 --> 15:49.122
that "harass women" online.

15:49.122 --> 15:51.037
No, I mean,
he's a genuine nice guy.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.168
You know, he can probably
get any woman he wants

15:52.168 --> 15:53.430
without resorting
to bullying tactics.

15:53.430 --> 15:55.432
Right, Jack?
- Is that a question?

15:55.432 --> 15:56.781
Syd, the truth is,

15:56.781 --> 15:58.435
you're the worst performer
in your department.

15:58.435 --> 15:59.871
You want to read
your performance reviews?

15:59.871 --> 16:02.048
- I don't have my readers.
- Fine. I'll read them.

16:02.048 --> 16:04.137
"Work is sloppy
and filled with errors.

16:04.137 --> 16:06.095
"Shows no initiative.

16:06.095 --> 16:08.315
"Brags about using sick days
to play golf.

16:08.315 --> 16:11.144
Can't remember the names of any
of the women on the floor."

16:11.144 --> 16:12.536
They all have the same hair.

16:12.536 --> 16:13.842
Mm-mm.

16:13.842 --> 16:14.974
And besides, if I was so bad,

16:14.974 --> 16:16.584
why didn't you fire me
yourself?

16:16.584 --> 16:18.978
'Cause I don't want to be
mean to and old--to a person.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.327
I don't buy it.

16:20.327 --> 16:21.545
You could've written
all that down just now.

16:21.545 --> 16:22.720
And my attorney said

16:22.720 --> 16:24.374
I shouldn't be speaking
with you anyway.

16:24.374 --> 16:26.028
Attorney?
So you've hired an attorney?

16:26.028 --> 16:28.770
Oh, yeah.
Real shark.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.293
Representing all of us.

16:30.293 --> 16:33.166
Three words:
class action lawsuit.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.732
Elliot, I'll see you in court.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.212
Jack, go suck an egg.

16:36.212 --> 16:39.737
Brenda,
I never respected you anyway.

16:39.737 --> 16:40.912
Oh.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.740
- That's you.
- That's me.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.965
Hey, isn't this good?
How's this for non-polished?

16:49.965 --> 16:51.619
Yeah, it's nice.
Um--

16:51.619 --> 16:53.664
Man, you really have
to stop frowning.

16:53.664 --> 16:54.665
These lines are gonna set.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.319
We have a little problem.

16:56.319 --> 16:59.235
Syd and the other old people
have lawyered up.

16:59.235 --> 17:00.671
What?
Oh, my God.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.064
I've got enough to think about
with this interview.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.110
Wait, they're not gonna
ask about this, are they?

17:04.110 --> 17:05.372
They might.

17:05.372 --> 17:07.026
No, no, no.
This is not happening.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.114
The whole point of this thing
was to show that

17:08.114 --> 17:09.550
we're on the side
of the underdogs.

17:09.550 --> 17:10.855
What am I gonna say when

17:10.855 --> 17:12.814
they ask me why I decided
to go fire grandpa?

17:12.814 --> 17:16.122
Well, I was thinking you
could maybe remind them that

17:16.122 --> 17:18.950
you know, you're a woman
of a certain age.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.517
What?

17:20.517 --> 17:22.432
I just spent the entire day
making myself look younger,

17:22.432 --> 17:24.347
and now
you want my defense to be

17:24.347 --> 17:25.783
that I eat prunes
every morning?

17:25.783 --> 17:28.395
Besides which, honestly,
I look like I'm 35 anyway.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.701
- Y-you don't.
- 37. Fine, whatever.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.007
- Okay.
- Ah, damn it.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.313
We're gonna have to rethink
this whole thing.

17:33.313 --> 17:34.836
I think it's more of
an attitude thing.

17:34.836 --> 17:37.447
Hey, Dori! Get the rest
of the style team back!

17:37.447 --> 17:39.797
Sadie needs me to eat turds
on live television.

17:43.627 --> 17:46.108
<i>Here to talk about Payne's
plan to bounce back</i>

17:46.108 --> 17:47.327
<i>from the recall,
CEO Katherine Hastings.</i>

17:47.327 --> 17:48.545
<i>Katherine,
thank you for being here.</i>

17:48.545 --> 17:50.025
<i>Well, it's great to be here, Colin.</i>

17:50.025 --> 17:52.375
She is really leaning into
the "I am old" thing hard.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.377
Looks like she smashed all
the "Golden Girls" characters

17:54.377 --> 17:56.075
into one person.

17:57.598 --> 17:59.121
You don't have a case, Martin.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.644
<i>Every one of the people
you fired is over 40.</i>

18:00.644 --> 18:02.429
<i>You think a jury will think
that's a coincidence?</i>

18:02.429 --> 18:04.692
We are downsizing
senior staff.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.041
Is it any surprise
that some of the people

18:06.041 --> 18:07.564
we're letting go
happen to be seniors?

18:07.564 --> 18:09.131
<i>It's textbook ageism.</i>

18:09.131 --> 18:10.828
<i>I'd get ready to open
the coffers if I were you.</i>

18:10.828 --> 18:13.179
No, the coffers will
remain firmly shut, thank you,

18:13.179 --> 18:15.485
because you need to prove
a pattern of discrimination,

18:15.485 --> 18:18.053
and one unlucky day
doth not a pattern make.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.316
<i>So if I look at everybody
you fired in the past,</i>

18:20.316 --> 18:22.275
<i>I wouldn't find a
disproportionate number</i>

18:22.275 --> 18:24.842
<i>of them that were over 40?</i>

18:24.842 --> 18:26.366
off, Martin.

18:28.672 --> 18:29.847
Oh, move, Howard.

18:29.847 --> 18:32.285
You need to get on
with your life!

18:32.285 --> 18:33.808
No, we can't do the layoffs.

18:33.808 --> 18:36.027
We can't do the layoffs.
- What?

18:36.027 --> 18:38.943
If you don't rehire all
these wrinkled, old fart bags,

18:38.943 --> 18:40.989
we're gonna get buried
in a slew of lawsuits

18:40.989 --> 18:42.251
that are gonna cost us way more
than we ever would've made

18:42.251 --> 18:43.861
by laying them off
in the first place.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.646
Well, where
are we gonna find the savings?

18:45.646 --> 18:47.126
We could fire
all the young people instead.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.649
Damn, you're just dying
to axe people today,

18:48.649 --> 18:49.824
aren't you, Jack?

18:49.824 --> 18:50.955
He's got a taste
for blood now.

18:50.955 --> 18:51.869
No, no, that's not
what I'm trying--

18:51.869 --> 18:53.088
Wait, fire young people?

18:53.088 --> 18:54.220
That's just
reverse discrimination.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.525
And then we'll be stuck

18:55.525 --> 18:56.831
with just the old people,
and let's be honest,

18:56.831 --> 18:58.267
they absolutely suck.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.879
- Not you. We value you.
- Yeah.

19:01.879 --> 19:03.316
Has she started
talking about the layoffs yet?

19:03.316 --> 19:04.882
<i>Have you decided</i>

19:04.882 --> 19:06.362
<i>where you'll find the money
to pay for all this?</i>

19:06.362 --> 19:08.843
<i>Well, at first, we discussed
closing a factory,</i>

19:08.843 --> 19:10.714
<i>but I said, "Absolutely not."</i>

19:10.714 --> 19:12.151
Ah, damn it.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.891
Our factories are the heart
of our company.

19:13.891 --> 19:17.156
Isn't it time for those of us
in the executive ranks

19:17.156 --> 19:18.592
to take the hit?

19:18.592 --> 19:20.550
<i>So you'll be letting go
of some executives?</i>

19:20.550 --> 19:22.465
Uh, you know,
that is the question

19:22.465 --> 19:25.381
that we asked ourselves, Colin.

19:25.381 --> 19:28.645
Uh, and the answer, Colin,
it may surprise you.

19:28.645 --> 19:31.300
The answer is...

19:31.300 --> 19:32.736
no.

19:32.736 --> 19:36.218
No, we are not gonna let go
of our executives.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.264
So where are you going to be
finding the savings, then?

19:38.264 --> 19:40.353
Such a good question, Colin.

19:40.353 --> 19:41.963
You know,

19:41.963 --> 19:43.660
and that's the same question
that we asked ourselves.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.184
What are we gonna do?

19:45.184 --> 19:48.230
We knew that we needed
an a answer right away

19:48.230 --> 19:53.540
uh, otherwise, there would
be enormous consequences.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.368
Close factory

19:55.368 --> 20:00.329
is unfortunately what
we realized we had to do, so...

20:00.329 --> 20:02.026
But you just said Joe America

20:02.026 --> 20:03.985
shouldn't pay for
corporate America's mistakes

20:03.985 --> 20:06.422
and that the factory was--
and I'm quoting here--

20:06.422 --> 20:08.119
"the heart of the company."

20:08.119 --> 20:10.470
Yes,
but we have many factories,

20:10.470 --> 20:13.429
so in a way,
we have multiple hearts.

20:13.429 --> 20:14.909
Like a cow.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.954
You're referring to
how a cow has four stomachs?

20:16.954 --> 20:19.000
No. Let me be clear.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.656
We have 20 cows,
each with a heart in them

20:22.656 --> 20:25.876
but still,
we are going to have to, uh,

20:25.876 --> 20:28.227
turn one of our cows
into chuck.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.141
Well,
sure to be an unpopular move,

20:30.141 --> 20:33.057
but you have to respect a woman
willing to stand behind it.

20:33.057 --> 20:34.668
Oh, well, thank you so much, Colin.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.800
Oh, and I just want to say
I know I look a little haggard.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.324
I was out very,
very late last night.

20:38.324 --> 20:41.457
Some of my friends took me out
for my 44th birthday.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.243
<i>Plus what we'll save on heat</i>

20:44.243 --> 20:45.853
minus the blankets
we had to buy,

20:45.853 --> 20:47.550
plus what we saved
on office supplies--

20:47.550 --> 20:50.553
They didn't think this ragtag
team of misfits could do it.

20:50.553 --> 20:51.815
Well, how do you like
them apples?

20:51.815 --> 20:54.514
We saved a total of $14.
- Huh.

20:54.514 --> 20:55.863
Not what I was expecting,

20:55.863 --> 20:57.604
but you gotta spend money
to save money, right?

20:57.604 --> 20:58.996
Mm-hmm.
That sounds right.

20:58.996 --> 21:00.041
Hey,
we should keep this going.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.825
Uh, the savings committee.

21:01.825 --> 21:03.784
We meet once a week,
we order in sushi,

21:03.784 --> 21:05.742
and we brainstorm ways
we can cut costs.

21:05.742 --> 21:07.962
Mm, sushi sounds
good right about now.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.703
I know.
You wanna go get something?

21:09.703 --> 21:11.966
I mean unless you're busy.
No pressure.

21:11.966 --> 21:14.055
- Mm-mm. That sounds fun.
- Awesome!

21:14.055 --> 21:15.491
Have you heard of this place
on Woodward?

21:15.491 --> 21:17.493
I heard it's really good,
but it's, like, pricey.

21:17.493 --> 21:18.973
Ah, we'll expense it.

21:18.973 --> 21:19.800
We just need to make sure
we talk about business for,

21:19.800 --> 21:21.105
like, five seconds.

21:21.105 --> 21:22.498
Okay, so like business,
business, business,

21:22.498 --> 21:23.456
business, shrimp tempura.
- Yep.

21:23.456 --> 21:24.674
- Yeah.
- That's it.
