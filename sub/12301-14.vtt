WEBVTT

00:17.224 --> 00:19.340
Preparing to drop
the incendiary devices.

00:20.475 --> 00:22.615
Dropping incendiary devices now.

00:58.024 --> 00:59.299
Alexx woods,

00:59.299 --> 01:00.488
Eric delko.

01:00.488 --> 01:02.260
Rick cuthbert, national park service.

01:02.260 --> 01:03.963
Welcome to the glades.

01:03.963 --> 01:05.564
Ash is pretty thick, Rick.

01:05.564 --> 01:07.342
Had to turn my wipers on a few times.

01:07.342 --> 01:09.000
Thought I was back in new jersey.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.434
Yeah, well, we're clearing
out the underbrush.

01:11.434 --> 01:12.849
Who found our vic?

01:12.849 --> 01:14.789
Firefighters, we think he's on a hunt.

01:14.789 --> 01:16.379
They were checking the firebreak.

01:16.379 --> 01:18.366
He's about 30 yards in.

01:19.015 --> 01:20.908
- In there?
- Don't worry, it's safe.

01:20.908 --> 01:22.746
Fire's controlled.

01:22.869 --> 01:24.400
Any idea how he got there?

01:24.400 --> 01:27.041
Well, we figure that's his
campsite down the firebreak.

01:27.041 --> 01:29.653
All right, we'll secure it,
and we'll process here.

01:29.653 --> 01:32.382
Sounds like a plan.
Just, uh, watch for gators.

01:32.382 --> 01:36.974
Yeah, you ranger boys love
scaring us sobe people, don't you?

01:37.780 --> 01:39.289
Everybody's a comedian.

01:45.786 --> 01:47.841
Our hunter had bad night.

01:48.254 --> 01:50.198
Gunshot.

01:50.270 --> 01:52.677
But no sign of a weapon.

01:54.389 --> 01:56.151
Probably killed during the night.

01:56.151 --> 01:58.038
Liver temp will tell us.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.486
Look at the drag marks.

02:00.732 --> 02:03.032
Somebody probably
placed him here.

02:08.650 --> 02:11.703
Wade thomas hinkle, sweetwater.

02:12.663 --> 02:14.900
Help me turn him over.

02:17.676 --> 02:19.341
A lot of blood.

02:19.341 --> 02:20.536
This an arterial hit?

02:20.536 --> 02:21.769
Yeah,

02:21.769 --> 02:24.876
poor guy went in
less than a minute.

02:29.830 --> 02:32.119
Those birds know something.

02:34.572 --> 02:37.057
What?

02:37.330 --> 02:38.508
Delko?

02:38.508 --> 02:40.139
Alexx, don't move.

03:05.810 --> 03:06.755
Get the car keys.

03:06.755 --> 03:08.216
Get the keys.

03:27.094 --> 03:28.912
- Let's run!
- No time, Alexx!

03:28.912 --> 03:30.735
We'll never make it!

03:30.956 --> 03:32.334
Eric!

03:32.897 --> 03:34.271
Grab this.

04:28.109 --> 04:31.525
MIAMI
2x14 Slow Burn

04:57.942 --> 04:59.513
Alexx?

05:00.259 --> 05:01.985
Alexx, you okay?

05:03.428 --> 05:04.648
Horatio?

05:04.648 --> 05:06.118
Hang on, sweetheart.

05:06.886 --> 05:08.140
Listen to me.

05:08.140 --> 05:09.291
Listen to me, it's okay.

05:09.291 --> 05:11.399
I'm just going to wash
your eyes out, okay?

05:11.399 --> 05:13.100
There you go.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.562
That feel better?

05:14.562 --> 05:17.568
I thought I was going to end up

05:17.568 --> 05:19.963
wearing a toe tag on my own table.

05:19.963 --> 05:21.843
No, you're not, you're
going to be fine.

05:21.843 --> 05:23.848
Does that feel better?

05:24.507 --> 05:26.114
Hang in there.

05:32.679 --> 05:34.518
Eric, the worst thing you
can do is rub them, man.

05:34.518 --> 05:35.955
Yeah, I know.

05:35.955 --> 05:36.883
but you know what?

05:36.883 --> 05:39.781
You get caught in a flash over
and them tell me that, all right?

05:39.781 --> 05:41.087
Well, I'm just saying...

05:41.087 --> 05:42.561
Frank.

05:43.055 --> 05:45.174
I'll take it from here, okay?

05:45.174 --> 05:47.812
Yep. / Thanks.

05:48.685 --> 05:50.671
- How you doing?
- I'm all right, H.

05:50.671 --> 05:51.821
Just, uh,

05:51.821 --> 05:52.980
doesn't make sense.

05:52.980 --> 05:54.896
I mean, we're supposed to be
on the safe side of that break,

05:54.896 --> 05:56.814
and the fire just came out of nowhere.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.598
Came out of nowhere.

05:58.598 --> 06:00.898
It was like someone just turned it on.

06:00.898 --> 06:02.262
You know what, Eric?

06:02.262 --> 06:03.943
Maybe somebody did.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.122
This is the dead hunter's truck.

06:13.181 --> 06:15.147
Yeah, campsite.

06:15.147 --> 06:17.780
We got a bunch of 308s.

06:17.860 --> 06:20.725
There's got to be close
to a hundred rounds here.

06:21.621 --> 06:23.404
You know what I'm thinking?

06:23.404 --> 06:25.161
I'm thinking Wade
was a sneaky hunter.

06:25.161 --> 06:29.433
I think he sat out here all night and
let the controlled burn do his work.

06:29.856 --> 06:32.495
Probably had a flashlight
at the end of his rifle,

06:32.495 --> 06:35.084
spotted game running from the fire.

06:38.590 --> 06:40.734
A lot of beer cans for one guy.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.778
For three guys.

06:43.467 --> 06:45.139
Means he had some friends.

06:45.139 --> 06:47.742
Hey, hunters have to register
with park services, don't they?

06:47.742 --> 06:50.691
Yeah. / We should check and
see if he came with anybody.

06:50.691 --> 06:53.886
That's a good idea.
I'll check out this pickup truck.

07:04.393 --> 07:06.056
You okay?

07:07.094 --> 07:10.148
Yeah, yeah, it's just a dog.

07:11.354 --> 07:13.214
I've got a bullet hole.

07:22.598 --> 07:24.927
Gunshot residue.

07:26.593 --> 07:28.462
Front to back

07:28.462 --> 07:30.740
in an upward trajectory.

07:35.405 --> 07:37.079
Steep angle.

07:37.079 --> 07:39.389
Just like the shot that
killed your hunter.

07:52.683 --> 07:55.492
I thought this was a controlled burn.

07:55.659 --> 07:57.814
How'd it get itself over here?

07:57.814 --> 07:59.664
It didn't.

07:59.664 --> 08:02.309
There's a second fire, Frank.

08:02.803 --> 08:04.738
What the hell?

08:04.904 --> 08:06.491
Fire underground?

08:06.491 --> 08:10.228
Right underneath the soil, right here,
is a peat fire smoldering.

08:10.228 --> 08:12.305
That's what's burning.

08:15.768 --> 08:17.157
We...

08:17.157 --> 08:19.573
need to find the point of origin.

08:23.611 --> 08:26.147
Look at this thing.
It's like one long fuse.

08:26.147 --> 08:29.889
Fire could have traveled
for hours underground.

08:40.289 --> 08:42.539
You okay? / Yeah.

08:42.539 --> 08:45.295
No time for recreation, Frank.

08:46.102 --> 08:48.132
Explains why the fire
didn't burn that way.

08:48.132 --> 08:50.515
It's all water from here on out.

08:51.668 --> 08:53.357
Look at this.

08:53.858 --> 08:55.808
What do you got?

08:55.808 --> 08:58.601
It could be the source of our fire.

08:58.821 --> 09:02.600
Roadside flare. Those babies
burn at 4,000 degrees.

09:02.732 --> 09:04.871
Right into the ground,

09:04.871 --> 09:07.070
and right at our team.

09:11.737 --> 09:13.036
Eric!

09:13.558 --> 09:15.318
Two reasons you start a fire.

09:15.318 --> 09:16.727
to destroy

09:16.727 --> 09:18.378
or to distract.

09:18.378 --> 09:20.707
Or maybe both.

09:20.970 --> 09:23.139
Look at this.

09:33.095 --> 09:35.198
She's about 25. / Yeah.

09:35.198 --> 09:37.782
That would be my guess.

09:38.428 --> 09:41.123
25-year-old in a disco dress?

09:41.313 --> 09:43.694
Doesn't make any sense she's all the
way out here in the middle of the glades.

09:43.694 --> 09:46.270
She had to come from
somewhere, didn't she?

09:46.270 --> 09:48.481
Yeah.

09:49.067 --> 09:51.945
Let's get Speed and take
a look around, right?

09:52.122 --> 09:53.519
Yup.

10:18.227 --> 10:20.291
Our girl from the everglades.

10:20.291 --> 10:23.517
Going to take some time to ID her,
her fingerprints got burnt in the fire.

10:23.517 --> 10:25.090
Got to use dental records.

10:25.090 --> 10:26.320
Okay.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.086
How are you doing?

10:28.227 --> 10:29.994
I'm fine...

10:30.761 --> 10:32.476
Once I took out my contacts,

10:32.476 --> 10:35.589
- but I can't see as well.
-That'll pass.

10:35.748 --> 10:37.865
What do we have here?

10:37.865 --> 10:40.256
Well, she was hit
with an irregular object

10:40.256 --> 10:42.877
with some sort of pattern.

10:43.117 --> 10:45.428
Alexx, her skin is so badly burned,

10:45.428 --> 10:47.882
- we need to check the bone.
- I'll add that to my list.

10:47.882 --> 10:49.962
What do you think
killed her, the fire?

10:49.962 --> 10:52.727
No. Blunt force trauma.

10:52.727 --> 10:57.449
Hinge fractures, injury to the front
of the skull crushing the rear of the skull.

10:57.969 --> 10:59.879
What about physical findings?

10:59.879 --> 11:01.646
Wasn't raped.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.438
But she has bite
marks on her breasts.

11:05.539 --> 11:08.552
The skin is definitely punctured,

11:08.552 --> 11:10.642
but there's so little detail,

11:10.642 --> 11:12.350
not enough for a mold.

11:12.350 --> 11:14.811
That's because he gnashed at her.

11:18.392 --> 11:19.626
Alexx,

11:19.626 --> 11:22.846
we're talking about
a sexual predator, aren't we?

11:23.760 --> 11:24.975
So did you fall in?

11:24.975 --> 11:26.688
As a matter of fact, I did.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.824
Well, you should wash up. There's
a lot of microorganisms out here, Frank.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.407
I'm fine.

11:32.811 --> 11:35.506
So is this the access road
to alligator alley?

11:35.506 --> 11:37.911
Yup, straight line through the glades.

11:38.074 --> 11:39.468
What happened to all the gators?

11:39.468 --> 11:41.835
Hunkered down in
holes till the fire's done.

11:42.092 --> 11:44.106
Animals are smarter than humans.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.495
Look here.

11:47.448 --> 11:49.972
Maybe this guy should
have hidden his tracks.

11:50.098 --> 11:51.932
Looks like there's a U-turn here.

11:51.932 --> 11:53.854
Two sets of tracks.

11:53.854 --> 11:55.835
There's three.

11:56.920 --> 11:59.733
This one's compromised
so it's no good, but

12:00.733 --> 12:04.499
this set here, it's low impact,
it's the kind that's, uh,

12:04.499 --> 12:06.403
environmentally friendly.

12:06.403 --> 12:08.098
The kind that tree huggers use.

12:08.098 --> 12:09.803
Or rangers.

12:10.308 --> 12:13.252
Yeah, Delko said that
ranger was a wise ass.

12:13.305 --> 12:15.654
Man, I can't believe you guys
are jamming me on this.

12:15.654 --> 12:17.461
Just answer the question, Rick.

12:17.461 --> 12:20.467
I didn't pull off alligator
alley and dump any girl.

12:20.868 --> 12:23.290
We looked into your
employment records.

12:23.290 --> 12:24.649
Frank.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.712
Shellie dumont.

12:26.712 --> 12:29.204
Eight instances of sexual harassment

12:29.204 --> 12:31.062
and/or assault in the workplace.

12:31.062 --> 12:34.283
Assault. Man, I grabbed her a few
times in the break room.

12:34.283 --> 12:36.373
So, what, you grab
a woman by the breast,

12:36.373 --> 12:39.075
- squeeze it a little bit, no big deal?
- I used to see her, okay?

12:39.075 --> 12:41.320
She gets engaged, wants to
pretend she's a virgin again

12:41.320 --> 12:42.488
and files a claim against me.

12:42.488 --> 12:44.553
So then you're the victim?

12:45.261 --> 12:46.802
I didn't touch your girl.

12:46.802 --> 12:49.462
I didn't start any fires, okay?
I'm innocent.

12:49.462 --> 12:51.153
What's going on with your cuffs, Rick,

12:51.153 --> 12:52.915
on your pants?

12:53.127 --> 12:54.818
They're singed.

13:00.482 --> 13:02.881
I kicked over a flare
at a road block last night.

13:02.881 --> 13:05.232
I have witnesses, ask around.

13:05.232 --> 13:07.632
I'm going to do that, Rick.
Thanks.

13:25.475 --> 13:27.163
Mr. Keating?

13:28.141 --> 13:29.955
That's Wade.

13:29.955 --> 13:31.775
That's my buddy.

13:32.503 --> 13:33.746
How does he look so good?

13:33.746 --> 13:35.371
You said he was in a fire.

13:35.371 --> 13:39.656
My colleagues managed to protect
his body under a fire blanket.

13:39.817 --> 13:43.779
So I understand that the two
of you got separated last night.

13:43.779 --> 13:45.850
Yeah. I went looking for him,

13:46.183 --> 13:48.104
but I got lost.

13:48.104 --> 13:49.826
Don't know where my dog is either.

13:49.826 --> 13:51.091
Animal control has got him.

13:51.091 --> 13:52.941
And we've got your truck.

13:53.866 --> 13:57.395
Your lip looks like it could
use a little ice.

13:57.876 --> 13:59.472
I'm okay.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.376
Just a little kickback.

14:01.376 --> 14:03.237
I understand there's
a sticker on your truck.

14:03.237 --> 14:05.708
That says you've been a
competitive shooter for 14 years,

14:05.708 --> 14:08.662
and you didn't lean
into your rifle recoil?

14:09.253 --> 14:10.740
All right.

14:12.346 --> 14:15.669
Me and Wade, we got into a little
a dustup over something stupid.

14:15.669 --> 14:18.364
who's the best blind singer,

14:18.364 --> 14:20.738
Ronnie milsap or Ray charles?

14:20.738 --> 14:22.228
Well,

14:22.228 --> 14:23.865
Ronnie's got the range,

14:23.865 --> 14:25.376
but Ray's got the voice.

14:25.376 --> 14:27.759
I tried to tell him the same thing.

14:27.759 --> 14:30.033
But he took a swipe at me and...

14:34.508 --> 14:36.609
Next thing you know,

14:36.748 --> 14:38.445
bust lip.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.731
You've got a little blood on your vest.

14:42.557 --> 14:44.396
Oh, well, I...

14:44.396 --> 14:46.992
must have got that when I was
skinning them squirrels.

14:46.992 --> 14:48.586
Got me two of them last night.

14:48.586 --> 14:52.555
You won't mind if I borrow your
vest to verify that, would you?

14:53.666 --> 14:55.952
No, no.

14:56.135 --> 14:58.805
I wouldn't mind that at all.

15:58.565 --> 16:00.357
Had to call in a favor.

16:00.357 --> 16:02.733
Was there any of our victim's
blood on the hunting vest?

16:02.733 --> 16:06.056
Nope, and what he was telling you
about skinning squirrels.

16:06.056 --> 16:07.670
It's not squirrel blood, either.

16:07.670 --> 16:09.234
What is it?

16:09.860 --> 16:10.786
Meow.

16:10.786 --> 16:11.910
Cat blood?

16:11.910 --> 16:15.090
Ran it against known antibodies
kept by fish and wildlife.

16:15.090 --> 16:16.515
Mountain lion.

16:16.515 --> 16:18.818
Less than 50 left in the glades.

16:18.818 --> 16:20.037
Protected species.

16:20.037 --> 16:23.657
So that means Joshua keating
and our victim were poaching.

16:23.657 --> 16:26.285
Still doesn't explain
who killed our victim.

16:29.371 --> 16:31.839
Hey.

16:31.839 --> 16:34.906
Looked closer at
Cuthbert's tire tracks.

16:34.906 --> 16:36.779
They support the ranger's story?

16:36.779 --> 16:39.726
Yeah, he was going at a
consistent speed the whole time.

16:42.923 --> 16:44.690
Never stopped.

16:44.690 --> 16:46.679
Never had time to dump the body.

16:46.679 --> 16:48.622
Same can't be said about
our second vehicle.

16:48.622 --> 16:50.566
It settled in the mud here.

16:50.868 --> 16:53.334
So, there's a chance he got
out and dumped the body.

16:53.334 --> 16:54.869
Then accelerated away.

16:54.869 --> 16:57.054
That's the car we need to find.

16:57.054 --> 16:58.549
Well, factoring in the wheelbase,

16:58.549 --> 17:01.207
we're looking for a
late-model ford sedan

17:01.207 --> 17:03.252
with a distinctive wear pattern.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.839
So we went from 5,000
possibles to one.

17:08.839 --> 17:11.756
We know what the tire looks like,
just not the car.

17:11.756 --> 17:13.452
Maybe there's a cop who does.

17:13.452 --> 17:14.385
How do you figure?

17:14.385 --> 17:15.954
Route 141.

17:15.954 --> 17:18.314
Alligator alley dumps out into a speed trap.

17:18.314 --> 17:21.361
Right. People driving through the glades
lose track of how fast they're going.

17:21.361 --> 17:23.828
Staties pop them
when they hit civilization.

17:51.942 --> 17:53.994
Interesting reading.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.242
So I was speeding last night.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.573
Where do I pay the fine?

18:01.012 --> 18:03.156
You are such a kidder, Dale.

18:04.669 --> 18:06.817
We found, um...

18:07.095 --> 18:11.616
tire tracks from your car...

18:12.172 --> 18:15.795
near this lady's body.

18:17.087 --> 18:19.272
Mm... never seen her before.

18:19.272 --> 18:23.409
Is there any reason that you were on
the access road to alligator alley last night?

18:23.409 --> 18:25.636
I pull over all the time in the glades.

18:25.636 --> 18:26.998
Nature calls.

18:26.998 --> 18:29.016
It wasn't to

18:29.016 --> 18:32.888
dump a body and set a fire
to disguise the situation, was it?

18:32.888 --> 18:34.615
No.

18:34.799 --> 18:37.202
Speed, welcome.

18:39.672 --> 18:41.529
What the hell is that?

18:42.722 --> 18:44.182
It's a z-nose.

18:44.182 --> 18:48.579
It picks up the scent of, uh,
fire. potassium, sulfur.

18:52.653 --> 18:55.089
Can you, uh, lift up your hands?

19:05.548 --> 19:07.424
It's negative.

19:09.164 --> 19:10.157
Told you.

19:10.157 --> 19:12.399
I was nowhere
near that girl.

19:12.399 --> 19:14.595
Do we have his car?

19:14.685 --> 19:16.066
No, but we can get it.

19:16.066 --> 19:17.351
Okay.

19:17.351 --> 19:19.136
Let's do that.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.029
Big dents.

19:23.209 --> 19:25.717
You don't need a
microscope to see these.

19:26.130 --> 19:27.551
Golf club maybe?

19:27.551 --> 19:29.792
Yeah, maybe.

19:39.007 --> 19:40.090
Blonde hair.

19:40.090 --> 19:43.845
Yeah, it looks like the same length
from our girl from the everglades.

19:43.845 --> 19:46.289
If it's got a follicular tag,
we can get a match.

19:46.289 --> 19:49.926
Hair might not be the only
thing she left behind.

19:59.748 --> 20:03.447
High roller club. Julie bryant.

20:05.108 --> 20:07.299
Did you say, uh, high roller club?

20:07.299 --> 20:09.932
Yeah, it's a frequent flyer
card for gamblers.

20:09.932 --> 20:14.080
The only place they gamble in the
everglades is the menachee indian tribe.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.762
Yeah, the tribe got a license
to run a casino on their land.

20:16.762 --> 20:18.602
Edge of the glades.

20:20.605 --> 20:21.816
So,

20:21.816 --> 20:25.233
Julie bryant left there
with the Stahl character.

20:27.449 --> 20:29.684
He drove her out to the glades.

20:30.348 --> 20:33.110
He jumped her in the car,
and in the struggle...

20:38.333 --> 20:40.889
This places Julie bryant in your car.

20:41.420 --> 20:43.103
Don't know a Julie bryant.

20:43.103 --> 20:46.182
Fine. Then explain how these
blonde hairs got in your car.

20:46.182 --> 20:48.430
Pulled hairs.

20:48.430 --> 20:50.731
DNA says they match our dead girl.

20:50.731 --> 20:52.016
Well,

20:52.016 --> 20:54.186
I did pick up a hitchhiker.

20:54.269 --> 20:57.878
She was blonde.

20:58.253 --> 20:59.940
You know, Dale,

20:59.940 --> 21:03.582
I bet that you pick up a lot
of hitchhikers, don't you?

21:03.582 --> 21:07.227
Oh, she was drunk, horny.
You know, we had some fun.

21:07.227 --> 21:10.616
Yeah, some fun. You mean,
you sexually assaulted her.

21:14.119 --> 21:16.219
Hey, she came on to me.

21:16.219 --> 21:17.750
You work the graveyard shift?

21:17.750 --> 21:18.842
No.

21:18.842 --> 21:21.083
10:00 to 6:00.

21:21.083 --> 21:23.223
Here's why I ask.

21:23.338 --> 21:28.465
I took a deeper look into your driving
record, and you have numerous tickets,

21:28.465 --> 21:30.509
all in the everglades,

21:30.509 --> 21:32.498
all at night.

21:32.498 --> 21:35.139
- I have trouble sleeping.
- You get in your car,

21:35.139 --> 21:38.336
you drive out to the everglades,
looking for desperate young woman

21:38.336 --> 21:40.964
who have been busted
out from the casino

21:40.964 --> 21:42.553
and have nowhere else to go.

21:42.553 --> 21:44.952
I did her a favor, okay?

21:44.952 --> 21:46.816
She needed a ride.

21:50.270 --> 21:52.110
Hey, Dale?

21:52.622 --> 21:54.163
Dale?

21:55.012 --> 21:57.002
Are you...

21:57.148 --> 21:59.432
are you a sexual predator?

22:01.301 --> 22:03.659
She was into it, okay?

22:03.659 --> 22:06.230
And she was alive where I left her.

22:06.516 --> 22:07.911
Where was that?

22:07.911 --> 22:09.609
Side of the road.

22:09.609 --> 22:11.576
Before this
guy tried to kill me.

22:11.576 --> 22:12.605
Which guy?

22:12.605 --> 22:14.019
Some guy.

22:14.019 --> 22:17.185
Just come hauling
ass out of nowhere.

22:19.562 --> 22:21.244
Didn't take you long, did it, bitch?

22:21.244 --> 22:22.865
I'm going to give you till three
to get out of that car.

22:22.865 --> 22:23.923
One.

22:23.923 --> 22:25.704
Two.

22:25.704 --> 22:27.631
Three.

22:28.402 --> 22:30.769
She goes high-tailing
it into the glades,

22:30.769 --> 22:33.189
and that's the last time
I saw either of them.

22:33.189 --> 22:39.034
So you're saying that you left
her alone running for her life.

22:39.124 --> 22:40.391
Yeah.

22:40.391 --> 22:42.429
And they say

22:42.429 --> 22:45.086
that chivalry is dead, Frank?

22:53.039 --> 22:54.453
So what do you think?

22:54.453 --> 22:56.662
Is he a coward or a killer?

23:12.437 --> 23:13.807
Arthur?

23:14.056 --> 23:16.018
We spoke on the phone.

23:16.817 --> 23:18.397
Did you bring the betting card?

23:18.397 --> 23:19.735
Yeah.

23:21.613 --> 23:23.394
What's this?

23:23.787 --> 23:25.959
We had to print that. It's evidence.

23:29.613 --> 23:31.069
Julie bryant's a
registered guest here.

23:31.069 --> 23:32.896
Checked in with a Mike sheridan.

23:33.050 --> 23:34.572
She hasn't used the
card since yesterday.

23:34.572 --> 23:35.965
Do you remember Julie?

23:35.965 --> 23:37.485
It's real high turnover here.

23:37.485 --> 23:39.518
I mean, it's 90% capacity.

23:41.075 --> 23:43.811
- His card's still active.
- Can you point him out?

23:43.811 --> 23:46.844
Lieutenant, people come
here to get lost.

23:47.308 --> 23:48.744
All right, table 23.

23:48.744 --> 23:50.357
Table 23.

23:50.546 --> 23:52.774
Thanks for your cooperation.

23:55.319 --> 23:57.155
Hey, Mike?

23:58.763 --> 24:00.338
Mike sheridan?

24:00.338 --> 24:02.090
Hold on.

24:02.090 --> 24:03.485
Hit me.

24:10.055 --> 24:11.538
Twenty-two.

24:15.866 --> 24:18.863
When was the last time
you saw Julie bryant, Mike?

24:19.012 --> 24:21.512
Julie and I had an argument.

24:21.512 --> 24:24.194
Well, we have reason to believe
that it was more than an argument.

24:24.194 --> 24:26.900
Well, Julie and I fight hard,
then we make up.

24:26.900 --> 24:29.101
Juices up the sex.

24:29.458 --> 24:30.780
Sir, are you in?

24:30.780 --> 24:32.136
He's cashing out.

24:32.136 --> 24:33.518
I'm on a roll here.

24:33.518 --> 24:35.631
Besides, it's early.
Julie'll be back.

24:35.631 --> 24:38.737
She always comes back.

24:38.837 --> 24:41.131
Not this time, Mike.

24:45.529 --> 24:47.297
Can I take my chips?

24:47.297 --> 24:49.271
Take your chips.

24:49.394 --> 24:50.873
Thank you.

24:52.619 --> 24:54.601
Just 'cause we had an argument

24:54.601 --> 24:56.624
doesn't mean I took her into the
glades and killed her.

24:56.624 --> 24:58.722
Well, somebody did, didn't they?

24:58.722 --> 25:01.131
When was the last time
you were out there?

25:01.131 --> 25:03.140
About five years ago.

25:03.140 --> 25:04.769
Gators, bugs, you can have it.

25:04.769 --> 25:06.404
Place gives me the creeps.

25:06.404 --> 25:08.843
What's that behind your ear?

25:12.804 --> 25:14.391
I don't know what the hell it is.

25:14.391 --> 25:16.921
Well, it looks like, uh,
amoebae and algae.

25:16.921 --> 25:18.778
Could be N. Fowleri,

25:18.778 --> 25:21.275
but I hope for your sake, it's not
'cause that stuff could kill you.

25:21.275 --> 25:22.838
All right, look.

25:23.245 --> 25:26.874
We had an argument here in the casino.
She was trying to tell me how to bet.

25:26.874 --> 25:29.448
She took off, went down the road,
flagged some guy down.

25:29.448 --> 25:31.456
She was trying to make me jealous.

25:34.113 --> 25:36.133
And you followed her, right?

25:36.741 --> 25:37.948
Well, they weren't hard to find.

25:37.948 --> 25:40.202
There's not much
between here and there.

25:41.629 --> 25:44.648
I saw a car parked
down the access road.

25:44.648 --> 25:46.942
It didn't take you long,
did it, bitch.

25:47.082 --> 25:49.306
You get out of the car.
I'll give you till three, one!

25:49.937 --> 25:51.496
Two! Three!

25:51.496 --> 25:53.246
Oh, my god, he's going to kill me!

25:53.246 --> 25:56.128
Somebody help me!

25:56.128 --> 25:57.217
Get back here, Julie.

25:57.217 --> 26:00.244
She ran off and the guy
took a u-ey out of there.

26:00.244 --> 26:02.828
You chased her into the
glades, didn't you?

26:02.828 --> 26:04.170
Yeah.

26:04.170 --> 26:06.739
But not very far.

26:06.872 --> 26:08.752
Julie!

26:09.547 --> 26:11.337
Where are you, Julie?

26:11.337 --> 26:14.257
Get out here now, Julie!

26:14.992 --> 26:17.784
It was dark, I couldn't see, I fell.

26:18.746 --> 26:20.915
That was enough for me.

26:20.915 --> 26:24.428
So you were going to just let her
walk all the way back to the casino?

26:24.428 --> 26:26.865
I was trying to teach her a lesson.

26:26.865 --> 26:28.123
How powerful, Mike.

26:28.123 --> 26:30.525
I'm going to need your
clothes from that night.

26:30.525 --> 26:32.364
I already sent them
to the hotel laundry.

26:32.364 --> 26:33.984
Fair enough. Speed.

26:34.111 --> 26:35.543
I'll get them.

27:03.542 --> 27:04.737
Thanks, man.

27:10.377 --> 27:13.311
I heard you found our hunter's
rifle in Keating's truck.

27:13.311 --> 27:16.018
And this bullet, pulled
from our hunter's body,

27:16.018 --> 27:17.565
came from his own gun.

27:17.679 --> 27:19.353
Suicide?

27:23.506 --> 27:26.596
I don't buy it. Why wouldn't Keating
just tell us that his friend killed himself.

27:26.596 --> 27:29.271
Some insurance policies,
they don't pay on suicides.

27:29.271 --> 27:32.472
Did you guys confirm from GSR.
That the gun discharged at close range?

27:32.472 --> 27:34.297
That was next.

27:40.733 --> 27:43.075
There's no gunpowder residue.

27:43.483 --> 27:45.500
What about the wound?

27:47.733 --> 27:51.352
There's no gunpowder stippling
and there's a ragged entry.

27:51.450 --> 27:53.847
This rifle was far away when
the bullet was discharged.

27:53.847 --> 27:55.746
What do you think,
ten feet, 30 feet?

27:55.746 --> 27:57.315
I don't know, it's
too hard to pinpoint,

27:57.315 --> 28:00.049
but either way, it was
too far for a suicide.

28:00.049 --> 28:02.824
I don't care what rifle was used,
Wade hinkle was murdered.

28:02.824 --> 28:04.616
I ain't no murderer.

28:05.072 --> 28:06.699
But you are a poacher.

28:06.699 --> 28:10.814
You and our victim were out hunting
mountain lions and the proof is on your vest.

28:10.814 --> 28:14.406
The two of you sat there waiting
for the fire to burn them out.

28:14.406 --> 28:16.049
That's not hunting.

28:16.418 --> 28:18.342
That's torture. / Look,

28:18.342 --> 28:20.456
I didn't want to do it.

28:20.531 --> 28:22.580
That's what the
argument was really about.

28:23.350 --> 28:24.959
The fire's too damn close.

28:24.959 --> 28:26.784
It's five hours away, you wuss.

28:26.784 --> 28:29.031
Those animals deserve
better than this.

28:29.326 --> 28:31.105
I'm getting the hell out of here.

28:31.105 --> 28:32.178
Like hell you are.

28:36.769 --> 28:39.851
Look, I left Wade there shooting,
and the next thing I know,

28:39.851 --> 28:40.852
he turns up dead.

28:40.852 --> 28:43.302
Except we found Wade's
rifle in your pickup.

28:45.265 --> 28:47.080
Look, was it an accident?

28:47.246 --> 28:50.486
Did you fall out of the chair
and his gun went off?

28:50.848 --> 28:54.523
Look, Mr. Keating, either you did it
or you're covering for someone who did.

28:55.857 --> 28:56.861
Okay,

28:56.861 --> 29:01.037
that's fine. We have a list of your past
hunting buddies from parks' register.

29:01.037 --> 29:02.606
Nick grande?

29:02.606 --> 29:04.488
Harry lindloff?

29:04.488 --> 29:07.969
Brad ritchie? Chick fletcher?

29:08.054 --> 29:09.220
Mr. Keating?

29:09.220 --> 29:13.128
I am not the kind of man
who turns in his friends.

29:13.128 --> 29:16.358
Sir, we're going to figure this out
with or without your help.

29:27.177 --> 29:28.521
Speed.

29:28.521 --> 29:31.971
Hey. Found, uh, Mike's pants.

29:32.093 --> 29:34.637
Cleaned, pressed, and singed.

29:34.637 --> 29:36.729
Good to know. Thank you.

29:37.701 --> 29:39.692
Do we,

29:39.692 --> 29:41.414
do we have any
32s in this system?

29:41.414 --> 29:42.440
Oh, yeah.

29:42.440 --> 29:46.693
Four domestic disturbance calls on Mike
and Julie in the last 18 months alone.

29:46.693 --> 29:48.575
All called in by neighbors.

29:48.575 --> 29:50.647
So she couldn't speak
up for herself then.

29:50.647 --> 29:52.969
Or run away, until last night.

29:52.969 --> 29:55.747
ER records from coconut grove
are on their way over.

29:55.747 --> 29:59.431
Julie sustained black eyes,
cut lip, one broken arm.

29:59.431 --> 30:02.053
And that's just on her
last trip to the ER.

30:02.053 --> 30:04.255
Well, he said the glades
made him nervous.

30:04.255 --> 30:06.548
Let's see how much.

30:10.622 --> 30:13.357
I told you, she ran into the glades.

30:13.483 --> 30:15.831
You haven't told us how you
started the fire, Mike.

30:15.831 --> 30:19.063
You still had those singe
marks on your pants,

30:19.178 --> 30:21.808
and as we know,

30:21.949 --> 30:26.162
those don't come out
in the wash, do they?

30:26.783 --> 30:28.231
Okay.

30:30.441 --> 30:33.326
When Julie ran into the
glades, I couldn't see.

30:33.446 --> 30:35.563
I grabbed a flare from my trunk.

30:37.613 --> 30:40.150
Julie! She didn't answer me.

30:40.281 --> 30:42.892
I tripped, dropped the flare.

30:44.529 --> 30:46.831
Sparks started flying,
I couldn't find her,

30:46.831 --> 30:50.435
I just got out of there.
I would never hurt her intentionally.

30:50.435 --> 30:51.815
Mike, let me ask you a question.

30:51.815 --> 30:55.132
When was the last time you
put Julie in the hospital?

30:57.050 --> 30:59.178
Mike, come on.
Black eyes, broken arms.

30:59.178 --> 31:02.112
You are a classic abuser, my friend.

31:03.358 --> 31:04.490
You killed her, didn't you, Mike?

31:04.490 --> 31:06.422
- I didn't kill her.
- Yes, you did.

31:06.422 --> 31:07.815
No.

31:10.992 --> 31:13.335
She got like that on her own, did she,

31:13.335 --> 31:15.269
sparky?

31:21.075 --> 31:23.064
That's not Julie.

31:23.677 --> 31:24.971
What?

31:24.971 --> 31:27.486
I don't know who it is,
but that's not Julie.

31:27.486 --> 31:28.935
Let me give you a little heads up.

31:28.935 --> 31:32.946
It is not a good idea
to lie to me, okay?

31:32.946 --> 31:35.497
Well, you suit yourself guys,

31:35.497 --> 31:37.829
but that's not Julie.

31:39.064 --> 31:40.547
Sit tight.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.650
He could be lying...

31:58.870 --> 32:01.990
It's hard to go far on
limited information, Frank.

32:01.990 --> 32:04.157
Don't take a bullet for me, Horatio.

32:04.157 --> 32:06.236
I'm the one that assumed that
gambling card belonged to our vic.

32:06.236 --> 32:10.087
Okay, so let's go back
to what we do know.

32:10.087 --> 32:16.180
Well, all we know for certain is the hair we
found in Dale stahl's car came from our vic.

32:16.180 --> 32:19.279
DNA made the match. / Okay,
So, the question becomes,

32:19.279 --> 32:21.374
who is our victim?

34:22.263 --> 34:24.161
So, Dale wants his car back.

34:24.161 --> 34:26.676
I bet he does.
Take a look at this.

34:31.500 --> 34:35.030
Whoever she is, she almost
got away, didn't she?

34:35.610 --> 34:37.614
Horatio, she was
beaten near Dale's car.

34:37.614 --> 34:39.589
That's not proof he did it.

34:39.589 --> 34:42.752
Puts old Dale on a very
short list, doesn't it?

34:45.132 --> 34:47.246
Alexx. Yeah.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.719
Okay, I'll be right there.

34:50.313 --> 34:53.705
We have an ID on the girl.

35:13.448 --> 35:16.291
Pattern marks on the stock.
I don't know how I could've missed that.

35:16.291 --> 35:19.123
I do. The fire. Your eyes are cooked.

35:19.123 --> 35:20.897
My eyes are fine, okay?

35:20.897 --> 35:23.857
Stop talking like that. They're going
to send me home on a medical.

35:23.857 --> 35:25.014
I'm not going to say anything.

35:25.014 --> 35:26.712
And look, it's fine.
There's no harm done.

35:26.712 --> 35:28.614
The suspect's still in custody.

35:28.614 --> 35:30.665
Just not the right suspect.

35:30.665 --> 35:32.686
So, what are you saying?
That Valera was right?

35:32.686 --> 35:34.280
I mean, the mountain lion did it?

35:34.280 --> 35:37.027
Well, it's the right church,
but the wrong pew.

35:37.027 --> 35:39.943
You remember how Mr. Keating
said his dog got very excited?

35:39.943 --> 35:42.233
Yeah, the dog was barking like crazy.

35:42.233 --> 35:46.956
And when he and Wade were arguing,
the dog ran around and around?

35:47.354 --> 35:50.728
The rifle was propped up
against the chair.

36:03.721 --> 36:06.461
And dog shoots man.

36:09.394 --> 36:12.641
Mr. Keating, why didn't
you just tell us the truth?

36:12.641 --> 36:15.104
I was afraid you'd put him down.

36:16.235 --> 36:18.324
Poor old Shula...

36:18.324 --> 36:20.579
I felt terrible.

36:22.132 --> 36:24.002
Went over to Wade.

36:24.002 --> 36:26.649
He tried to wake him up.

36:33.411 --> 36:35.423
can I take him home with me now?

36:35.423 --> 36:38.044
I'm afraid not yet, Mr. Keating.

36:38.044 --> 36:42.192
Animal control is going to want to
hold onto him for another day or two.

36:42.888 --> 36:44.213
Red tape.

36:44.213 --> 36:47.194
Probably thinks he's getting punished.

36:49.468 --> 36:50.665
Well, um...

36:50.665 --> 36:51.942
I'll catch you later.

36:51.942 --> 36:53.516
Okay, Eric.

36:59.575 --> 37:01.150
Do you want to call
a family member?

37:01.150 --> 37:02.495
You can use my phone.

37:02.495 --> 37:04.444
Shula is my family.

37:07.794 --> 37:10.326
You probably think
I'm crazy, don't you?

37:11.180 --> 37:12.770
No.

37:12.954 --> 37:16.862
I'd never underestimate the love
of a southern man for his dog.

37:21.952 --> 37:23.804
So, who is she, Alexx?

37:25.448 --> 37:28.799
Her dental records say
she's Sandi jane willis.

37:28.799 --> 37:30.841
Got a naples address.

37:30.841 --> 37:32.393
We ran her DNA through CODIS.

37:32.393 --> 37:35.262
She was in missing
persons three years ago.

37:36.213 --> 37:38.406
Missing persons...

37:39.244 --> 37:43.666
Missing persons. so, somebody cared
enough to put her in the database, didn't they?

37:43.666 --> 37:46.333
God's forgotten children?

37:46.894 --> 37:49.703
Alexx, what is this mark?

37:49.703 --> 37:52.001
Oh, the blunt force trauma?

37:52.001 --> 37:55.009
It took some getting,
and it's not complete,

37:55.009 --> 37:59.629
but the killer was wearing brass
knuckles or some kind of ring.

38:04.886 --> 38:07.122
Well, why do you want my ring?

38:07.558 --> 38:11.017
That ring could help eliminate
you as a suspect.

38:18.182 --> 38:19.580
Or...

38:22.561 --> 38:25.999
the imprint from your ring

38:25.999 --> 38:28.527
could prove

38:29.249 --> 38:31.937
that you killed Sandi willis.

38:33.846 --> 38:35.299
You see, Dale...

38:35.299 --> 38:37.671
I believe that you

38:37.671 --> 38:40.790
hit Sandi in the head with that ring.

38:48.508 --> 38:52.013
You continued to hit her until her
head was crushed on the ground,

38:52.013 --> 38:53.829
which killed her.

38:55.791 --> 38:58.472
And then, after she was dead,

38:58.472 --> 39:00.923
you dragged her
into the everglades

39:00.923 --> 39:03.663
and left her for the alligators.

39:04.972 --> 39:07.656
Sound familiar?

39:08.021 --> 39:11.329
Dale, the problem
with sexual predators

39:11.329 --> 39:15.270
is that they don't get
satisfied by the kill.

39:15.270 --> 39:17.505
They get turned on by it.

39:17.616 --> 39:20.493
So, true to your species,

39:20.493 --> 39:23.579
you went back to the casino...

39:23.579 --> 39:26.456
accidentally running
into Julie bryant,

39:26.456 --> 39:31.030
who was attempting to escape
from her abusive boyfriend.

39:32.269 --> 39:34.309
The difference, Dale,

39:34.309 --> 39:36.540
between Sandi and Julie,

39:36.540 --> 39:40.711
is Julie outwitted you and escaped.

39:40.795 --> 39:44.263
She got away, didn't she?

39:49.639 --> 39:51.977
Can I get my ring back?

39:56.319 --> 39:58.436
Sure, Dale.

39:58.924 --> 40:00.887
You're going to get your ring back.

40:01.636 --> 40:04.435
In about 75 years.

40:16.129 --> 40:17.503
Thank you.

40:19.430 --> 40:20.556
Excuse me?

40:20.556 --> 40:23.430
Where do I go to see someone
who's been arrested?

40:23.690 --> 40:25.282
I'm sorry?

40:25.282 --> 40:28.850
I'm looking for a friend of mine
who's been arrested, Mike sheridan.

40:29.011 --> 40:31.151
You're Julie.

40:31.288 --> 40:33.111
Yeah. How'd you know?

40:33.111 --> 40:36.297
Julie, Mike's been arrested
for starting that fire.

40:36.297 --> 40:39.631
And this is your opportunity
to get away from him.

40:39.631 --> 40:41.559
Wherever I go, he'll just find me.

40:41.559 --> 40:42.983
That is not true.

40:42.983 --> 40:45.000
He really does love me, you know.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.965
Mike does not love you.

40:46.965 --> 40:48.820
If he hadn't come after me,
I'd be dead by now.

40:48.820 --> 40:51.184
Julie? / Look, I can't talk
about this right now.

40:51.184 --> 40:52.940
Where is he? / Julie?

40:52.940 --> 40:54.834
Please?

41:00.949 --> 41:02.194
Okay.

41:02.194 --> 41:05.444
Mike is across the hall.

41:06.355 --> 41:08.419
Thank you.

41:08.911 --> 41:10.654
Take care.

41:54.094 --> 41:55.673
Horatio?

41:58.067 --> 42:00.049
Who's the girl?

42:00.966 --> 42:02.848
That's, um...

42:04.279 --> 42:06.608
That's Sandi willis.

42:07.326 --> 42:08.727
Girl from the everglades?

42:08.727 --> 42:10.457
Yeah.

42:10.582 --> 42:12.397
She's beautiful.

42:12.397 --> 42:14.359
Yes, she is.

42:15.067 --> 42:17.685
Listen, I'm going to go for a burger
and a beer. You want to go?

42:17.685 --> 42:19.709
My nickel.

42:19.994 --> 42:22.603
That sounds good.
Can you give me five?

42:23.022 --> 42:24.104
Yeah.

42:24.104 --> 42:25.669
Okay.

42:26.259 --> 42:28.069
I'll see you outside.

42:57.081 --> 42:58.498
Mrs. Willis?

42:58.498 --> 43:00.618
Is this Sandi's mom?

43:00.618 --> 43:02.676
Mrs. Willis, this is, um...

43:02.676 --> 43:06.242
this is Horatio caine from miami P.D.

43:06.242 --> 43:08.657
Yeah.

43:09.138 --> 43:11.517
I'm sorry.

43:15.428 --> 43:18.158
Um, well... you can...

43:18.158 --> 43:20.647
you can do that at the mortuary.

43:20.647 --> 43:22.902
Yeah.

43:25.048 --> 43:27.270
Mrs. Willis, um...

43:27.270 --> 43:30.897
I was, I was there, and Sandi...

43:30.897 --> 43:34.813
Sandi did not suffer, okay?

43:34.941 --> 43:37.698
Right.

43:38.311 --> 43:40.976
No, I,I'm still here.

43:40.976 --> 43:44.010
I'm here.
