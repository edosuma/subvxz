WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.971
DAVID: You guys,
Sophie is absolutely adorable.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.973
Oh, this is how I know
I'm ready to be a father.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.309
She is drooling all over
my 12-ply cashmere sweater,

00:08.342 --> 00:09.643
and I don't even care.

00:09.677 --> 00:10.811
(baby crying)
Oh, no, no, no.

00:10.844 --> 00:11.979
Did I do something wrong?

00:12.012 --> 00:13.714
Is she upset that we have to
sit in the dirt

00:13.747 --> 00:15.015
and eat out of boxes
with plastic utensils?

00:15.049 --> 00:16.317
No, no, she's just hungry.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.919
Oh, that's right,
those are my feelings. Oh.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.321
There you go.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.590
(baby crying)

00:23.691 --> 00:24.425
(crying stops)

00:24.458 --> 00:26.327
Look at that.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.496
Mother and child connecting.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.165
I wish there was some way
for our son to breast-feed.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.666
Statistically,
kids who breast-feed

00:32.700 --> 00:34.602
have fewer
ear and respiratory infections.

00:34.635 --> 00:37.171
The antibodies fight
bacteria, viruses.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.839
It's fun being with
a doctor, isn't it?

00:38.872 --> 00:40.674
Yeah, it's like
living with a magazine

00:40.708 --> 00:42.009
I never wanted to read.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.844
Of course, for some mothers,
breast-feeding can become

00:43.877 --> 00:45.346
an addiction unto itself.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.348
My mom breast-fed me
until I was four.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.350
I'm hungry.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.918
Let's see.
I have fishy crackers.

00:50.951 --> 00:53.287
I want booby.

00:53.321 --> 00:54.455
What do you
have there, Davey?

00:54.488 --> 00:56.090
Chocolate syrup.

00:56.124 --> 00:58.192
I'm gonna put it on them
to make chocolate milk.

00:58.226 --> 00:59.860
Up you come.
Come on.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.195
Oh, honey, no.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.764
Painful/yucky childhood memories
are meant to be repressed.

01:03.797 --> 01:04.932
Why don't you
ask your surrogate?

01:04.965 --> 01:06.066
You know,
see if she'll pump for you.

01:10.271 --> 01:11.605
What was that?

01:11.639 --> 01:13.707
Lots of people have
problems with this, actually.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.709
Last week, I was
breast-feeding Sophie

01:15.743 --> 01:17.111
while we were having lunch
at La Fica,

01:17.145 --> 01:18.646
and the manager
came up to me and said,

01:18.679 --> 01:20.114
"Would you mind
doing that somewhere private?"

01:20.148 --> 01:21.549
You should get
your breast-feeding friends

01:21.582 --> 01:22.716
and go back there.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.218
You should protest
that restaurant.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.053
But you should do something
that, you know,

01:26.086 --> 01:28.722
would really get people talking,
like a... like a flash mob.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.057
Yeah, yeah,
I'll help you.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.660
I'm great at that stuff.
And besides, I would do anything

01:32.693 --> 01:34.562
for little Sophie.
It's beautiful.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.330
Until she decides
to bite down on my nipple.

01:36.364 --> 01:37.998
My mom used
to hate that.

01:38.031 --> 01:41.935
Of course, you take away my
Hot Wheels, you pay the price.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.775
Yay, Bryan! These maternity
clothes are so cool!

01:47.808 --> 01:49.643
But you shouldn't have
bought them for me.

01:49.677 --> 01:52.346
He didn't. I took them from
the Sing! wardrobe department.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.182
We did that whole fake pregnancy
storyline first season.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.316
Remember?

01:55.349 --> 01:57.418
Oh, we didn't
get cable in Ohio.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.586
Oh, honey, it's a network show.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.853
Please don't make me keep lying.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.822
Goldie, uh, we, uh,

02:01.855 --> 02:03.924
we actually wanted
to ask you something.

02:03.957 --> 02:04.992
Sure.

02:05.025 --> 02:08.696
Um, as men,
we can do many things.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.598
But what we can't do

02:10.631 --> 02:12.533
is produce breast milk.

02:12.566 --> 02:16.537
So we were wondering if you
would consider pumping milk

02:16.570 --> 02:17.438
for our baby?

02:17.471 --> 02:19.106
Oh, my gosh, of course.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.275
I mean, at least for
the first couple of months.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.177
That's so great.
Thank you.
Thank you, Goldie.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.779
It's awesome my mom's
gonna do that for you guys.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.381
I don't know any
reason why women today

02:27.415 --> 02:29.016
wouldn't want to breast-feed.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.518
Well, I'll give you two.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.619
One, two.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.120
Can you imagine

02:33.153 --> 02:35.823
what these sweeties would
look like if I had a little one

02:35.856 --> 02:37.291
sucking on them all day long

02:37.325 --> 02:39.126
like they were root beer
Big Gulps?

02:39.159 --> 02:41.362
Ah, big news, Bryan!

02:41.395 --> 02:42.863
Scott Baio says yes!

02:42.896 --> 02:44.298
He'll paint your house!

02:44.332 --> 02:45.899
Did you hear that,
Harvey Milkbone?

02:45.933 --> 02:47.401
Chachi's gonna
paint our house!

02:47.435 --> 02:49.470
And many women don't have
the time to breast-feed,

02:49.503 --> 02:51.239
because they got to get
back to work.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.474
That's why I won't be
making my own milk.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.310
'Cause I'll be too busy making
those dead presidents.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.312
Well, I didn't
breast-feed with Shania

02:58.346 --> 02:59.980
because I had to work
and finish up high school.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.482
It was a lot.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.483
Wait a minute.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.984
You didn't breast-feed me?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.219
But you turned out great.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.387
But the benefits.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.988
I could've been so much more.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.358
(crowd cheering)

03:12.360 --> 03:13.894
Thank you.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.996
I accept this Nobel Peace Prize
with honor.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.998
Please, sit down.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.600
I need to thank my mom.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.169
If it weren't for her breast
milk, I don't know where I'd be.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.071
Probably not curing cancer,

03:24.104 --> 03:26.507
designing a car engine
that runs on spittle

03:26.540 --> 03:29.977
or balancing my country's
budget, that's for sure.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.346
I'm sorry, Shania.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.848
But at least now we can make
sure Bryan and David's baby

03:34.882 --> 03:36.116
gets all the milk he needs.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.918
That's perfect.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.620
That's just perfect.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.691
JANE: Rocky, I need
to talk to you about Brice.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.858
Are you busy?

03:44.892 --> 03:46.193
No, just giving
the Sing! writers

03:46.226 --> 03:47.194
notes on a script.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.629
So, Jane,

03:48.662 --> 03:52.533
how's it going with you and that
fine tub of creamy Greek yogurt?

03:52.566 --> 03:53.701
Does he have

03:53.734 --> 03:54.868
that honey at the bottom?

03:54.902 --> 03:56.136
He hasn't asked me out,

03:56.169 --> 03:58.372
and I've used
all my best moves on him.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.541
Just got your text. What's the
emergency? "Help me! Help me!"

04:00.574 --> 04:02.610
My computer won't let me
get on the Internet.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.845
Could you take a look
at it for me, please?

04:05.479 --> 04:06.480
Let me see what...

04:06.514 --> 04:07.881
I dropped something.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.249
I'll get it.
I'll get it.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.551
No, I'll get it.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.919
Here's your problem.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.821
Somebody completely unplugged
you from the Internet.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.489
Oh.
There you go.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.491
Should be as
good as new.

04:17.525 --> 04:20.060
Awesome bra,
by the way.

04:20.093 --> 04:23.297
Women don't do that
anymore, Jane.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.333
We see something we want,
we go after it.

04:25.366 --> 04:28.101
Walk up to him and say,
"You want to go out with me?

04:28.135 --> 04:30.070
Yes or no?"

04:30.103 --> 04:32.105
You better be right.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.576
Night.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.944
Brice?

04:37.678 --> 04:39.146
I would like to go out.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.247
On a date.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.415
With you.

04:41.449 --> 04:42.583
Yes or no?

04:42.616 --> 04:44.785
Sure.

04:44.818 --> 04:48.556
ROCKY: Now that's what
I'm talking about, girl!

04:53.861 --> 04:55.696
(laughs)

04:55.729 --> 04:57.264
Look, honey.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.532
It's a unicorn

04:58.566 --> 05:00.000
playing the piano.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.769
That's insane.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.003
It would sound terrible.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.105
Their hooves couldn't properly
finger the keys.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.540
What's gotten into you?

05:06.574 --> 05:08.542
Not breast milk,
that's for sure.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.110
Are you still upset about that?

05:10.143 --> 05:12.012
Yes. I texted
everybody at school

05:12.045 --> 05:13.847
to ask if they were breast-fed,

05:13.881 --> 05:16.016
and the answer was
unanimously yes.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.785
Except for Brain Dead Brandon,

05:17.818 --> 05:19.953
the stupidest kid
in the whole school.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.022
Brandon, how old
is the universe?

05:22.055 --> 05:23.190
Sixteen.

05:23.223 --> 05:25.225
Brandon, who invented
the telephone?

05:25.258 --> 05:26.560
Orville Redenbacher.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.996
Brandon, what happened
to you?

05:29.029 --> 05:30.564
Shh. I'm peeing.

05:32.500 --> 05:36.470
Shania, I'm sorry I
didn't breast-feed you.

05:36.504 --> 05:39.373
But there's nothing I
can do about it now.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.074
Actually, there is.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.544
I found a story
about a kid in Great Britain

05:43.577 --> 05:45.045
who's eight and still nursing.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.480
Look!
What?

05:46.514 --> 05:47.815
Oh, no!

05:47.848 --> 05:49.049
And he has braces?

05:49.082 --> 05:50.317
That poor woman.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.653
She clearly knows the benefits
of breast milk,

05:52.686 --> 05:54.755
which is why I want in on yours.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.089
You are nine years old.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.691
I don't need
to suck it out of you.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.893
I just want you
to squirt it on my cereal

05:59.927 --> 06:01.395
and in my hot chocolate.

06:01.429 --> 06:02.763
Nothing weird.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.264
It's not gonna happen.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.934
And that is a completely
inappropriate conversation.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.269
The next time you bring
it up, you're grounded.

06:09.302 --> 06:12.239
Fine. But as soon as I get
enough money for a plane ticket

06:12.272 --> 06:14.442
and a passport, I'm running away
to Great Britain.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.509
Ta-ta.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.578
Ta...?

06:17.611 --> 06:18.879
(gasps)

06:18.912 --> 06:20.848
Mm-hmm!

06:20.881 --> 06:24.518
My ex Darnell
would have loved this.

06:24.552 --> 06:25.753
You know what?

06:25.786 --> 06:27.955
I'm gonna buy it, take a picture
of myself in it,

06:27.988 --> 06:30.691
and send it to him in a text
at 2:00 a.m. that reads,

06:30.724 --> 06:32.693
"You up?"
(laughs)

06:32.726 --> 06:34.394
No matter what kind of pump
you could possibly want,

06:34.428 --> 06:35.563
they'll have it here
at Suck It.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.197
Hello.
Hello.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.933
This is my Lactation
Consultant, Violet.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.234
Welcome.
And this is Bryan,

06:41.268 --> 06:43.403
the guy who came up
with the whole idea

06:43.437 --> 06:44.538
for our flash
mob protest.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.440
You're like a hero
to the moms around here.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.975
They're calling you
a "lactivist."

06:48.008 --> 06:50.077
Well, that's very
clever for moms.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.545
Can we get to the other
reason we're here?

06:51.579 --> 06:53.447
We need to pick
out a breast pump.

06:53.481 --> 06:55.315
Well, are you and your wife
looking to buy?

06:55.348 --> 06:57.050
'Cause we have
rentals, too.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.052
Oh.
Perhaps you have mistaken me

06:59.086 --> 07:01.489
for my good friend
and tennis partner, Wanda Sykes.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.056
This woman and I

07:03.090 --> 07:04.091
are not together.

07:04.124 --> 07:04.892
Sorry.

07:04.925 --> 07:05.959
She is carrying a child

07:05.993 --> 07:07.060
for my partner David and I,

07:07.094 --> 07:08.829
and she has agreed
to pump milk for our son.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.898
That is beautiful
that you are willing

07:10.931 --> 07:13.634
to give of your time
and life-force.

07:13.667 --> 07:14.668
Isn't it?

07:14.702 --> 07:17.004
Oh, Goldie,
you can't imagine

07:17.037 --> 07:18.606
the peace that
you're going to feel

07:18.639 --> 07:20.440
knowing that your body
is providing sustenance

07:20.474 --> 07:21.675
for another being.

07:21.709 --> 07:22.943
It's not fair.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.678
I want my son and I to
experience that closeness.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.914
Oh. You're that guy.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.316
I know exactly what
you're looking for, Bryan.

07:29.349 --> 07:30.317
Follow me.

07:30.350 --> 07:32.085
Violet.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.688
It's called
The Milkman.

07:34.722 --> 07:38.492
We've never sold one, because
it's incredibly weird.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.162
Oh, my God,
it's absolutely perfect.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.565
Please tell me
it comes in a tartan plaid.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.341
David, check it out.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.342
Look what I got

07:55.375 --> 07:56.644
at the breast pump store.

07:56.677 --> 07:57.645
It's called

07:57.678 --> 07:58.979
The Milkman.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.549
Was "The Humiliator"
already trademarked?

08:01.582 --> 08:03.183
Don't judge it until you try it.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.018
(chuckles):
Oh, no, no, no.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.353
I'm not putting that thing on.

08:06.386 --> 08:07.988
David, this is
really important to me.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.957
Okay.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.491
So, here's our baby.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.527
Hold him to your nipple
and let him suckle.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.963
And don't worry, 'cause our real
baby won't have a loose eye.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.064
Please don't make me do this.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.332
Come on, make sure
he has a good latch.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.001
(sighs)

08:22.002 --> 08:24.004
Let's-- come here, little guy.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.172
Just really
get in there.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.740
Shove it in there.

08:26.774 --> 08:28.241
Feel close?
All right.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.577
You feel the
closeness, don't you?

08:29.610 --> 08:30.578
(chuckles):
Yeah.

08:30.611 --> 08:31.579
Oh, look how sweet.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.213
All right, baby's full.

08:33.246 --> 08:37.017
I'm sorry, Bry, I just don't
have the same bizarre need

08:37.050 --> 08:39.019
to feel like a lady,
or whatever this is.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.821
I don't want to be
a woman, David.

08:40.854 --> 08:41.989
Breast-feeding is about bonding.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.757
Don't you want
to create a deeper,

08:43.791 --> 08:45.492
more meaningful connection
to our son?

08:45.525 --> 08:48.028
Yes, but I just don't need
plastic breasts to do that.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.699
Bry, where are you going?

08:51.732 --> 08:53.934
I have a protest
to produce.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.769
Where I can go hang
out with mature people

08:55.803 --> 08:57.705
who understand the importance
of breast-feeding.

08:57.738 --> 08:58.739
Bry.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.777
Don't forget your dolly.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.116
(pop music playing)
BRICE: Yeah! You like the music?

09:09.149 --> 09:10.751
Since you're a traditional type,

09:10.784 --> 09:12.452
I thought
I'd stick to the classics.

09:12.485 --> 09:13.621
Missy Elliot.

09:13.654 --> 09:14.888
(music stops)

09:14.922 --> 09:16.624
You know that, uh,
she actually sleeps

09:16.657 --> 09:18.191
in a hollowed-
out Ferrari?

09:18.225 --> 09:20.527
For real.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.562
(chuckles)

09:25.933 --> 09:27.400
Don't be afraid.

09:27.434 --> 09:30.403
Got big, bad,
perfectly-exfoliated Brice

09:30.437 --> 09:31.639
to protect you.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.973
No, no, I'm fine.
(car alarm chirps)

09:33.006 --> 09:34.474
I just thought
that all these neighborhoods

09:34.507 --> 09:35.809
got burned down
in the riots.

09:35.843 --> 09:40.247
So, uh, where's
the, um, restaurant?

09:40.280 --> 09:43.316
Is it somewhere between
these random shopping carts

09:43.350 --> 09:45.552
and the unsupervised toddlers
with hoop earrings?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.087
Actually, it's
not a restaurant.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.722
It's a food truck.

09:48.756 --> 09:49.923
Food truck, yeah.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.325
Aziz Ansari, uh, talked
about it on his Twitter.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.161
It's the best
food truck in L.A.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.630
Although, there is this place
in Echo Park this woman has,

09:56.664 --> 10:00.500
it's called Topless Tapas;
but the food, not so good.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.169
Oh, I know these
guys. Hey, now!

10:02.202 --> 10:03.570
Here.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.806
(speaks Korean)

10:05.839 --> 10:08.341
Wait, you actually speak
that gobbledy-gook?

10:08.375 --> 10:10.110
Wait, I have one.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.145
(Korean accent):
"15 dolla, make you holla."

10:13.146 --> 10:14.281
(laughs)

10:14.314 --> 10:15.849
That's not funny.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.150
Oh, come on, it's a joke.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.518
It's not funny.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.120
Listen, Jane, if you can't
get through the night

10:20.153 --> 10:21.689
without, you know,
saying stuff like that,

10:21.722 --> 10:23.190
I'm happy to
take you home.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.127
Sorry.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.162
All right.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.931
There you go.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.766
Thank you.

10:32.800 --> 10:33.967
Try one?

10:34.001 --> 10:35.803
Ready?

10:37.370 --> 10:39.506
Good, huh? See?

10:39.539 --> 10:41.174
How do you say
"thank you"?

10:41.208 --> 10:42.609
(man speaks Korean)

10:42.642 --> 10:43.610
(repeats Korean phrase)

10:43.643 --> 10:44.644
(repeats Korean phrase)

10:44.678 --> 10:45.713
(repeats Korean phrase)

10:45.746 --> 10:46.947
(chuckles)
Say it again.

10:46.980 --> 10:47.948
(repeats Korean phrase)

10:47.981 --> 10:49.549
I got something
in my eye now.

10:49.582 --> 10:50.684
(both laugh)

10:52.585 --> 10:54.554
I thought we were out of milk.

10:54.587 --> 10:55.856
We are.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.025
This isn't cow milk,
it's breast milk.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.192
Shania!

10:59.226 --> 11:00.728
Where did you get that?!

11:00.761 --> 11:03.230
Online, with the AmEx gift card
Nana gave me

11:03.263 --> 11:04.564
for my birthday.

11:04.597 --> 11:08.401
She told me I could buy
whatever I want under $75.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.237
There's a Web site
for breast milk?

11:10.270 --> 11:13.874
"The safe, clean,
legal-in-most-states place

11:13.907 --> 11:15.876
"for overproducing mothers

11:15.909 --> 11:17.544
"who want to supplement
their income

11:17.577 --> 11:20.748
"and... fetishists.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.516
Endorsed by Marie Osmond."

11:23.550 --> 11:25.886
But you don't even know
whose breasts that came from.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.155
Don't worry. I ran a
thorough background check.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.157
She's a college professor
named Katherine

11:30.190 --> 11:32.592
who doesn't smoke, drink
or read Stephenie Meyer.

11:32.625 --> 11:33.861
Give me that.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.229
Shania Clemmons!
You are not drinking

11:36.263 --> 11:37.898
a stranger's breast milk
you bought on the Internet.

11:37.931 --> 11:41.268
But this could be my only way
into an Ivy League college.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.569
Do you know
how stupid that sounds?

11:42.602 --> 11:43.670
No, I don't.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.938
Because I wasn't breast-fed,

11:44.972 --> 11:47.074
so my feeble brain
is underdeveloped.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.276
Do not drink that breast milk.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.379
I am not kidding, Shania.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.881
Don't make me count to three.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.116
One.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.717
Two.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.452
Young lady,
if you put one drop

11:59.486 --> 12:01.454
of that nice woman's milk
into your mouth,

12:01.488 --> 12:04.291
you will be sorry.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.126
Big-time sorry.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.029
JANE:
I'm telling you, Rocky,

12:09.062 --> 12:10.597
the date went great.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.632
No, he totally took control.

12:12.665 --> 12:15.402
I let myself get bossed around,
and I loved it.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.270
Oh, well, then.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.272
I guess you should ask him out
for another date.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.974
He just might
turn you out, girl.

12:21.008 --> 12:22.275
Turn me out what?

12:22.309 --> 12:23.944
Oh, you'll know when it happens.

12:23.977 --> 12:26.579
I got to go.
Here he comes.

12:26.613 --> 12:27.948
Hey, now.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.149
Oh, hey.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.151
Um... uh, uh,
what are you doing tonight?

12:31.184 --> 12:33.120
Maybe I can take you
for a meal

12:33.153 --> 12:34.654
at a real restaurant,
where we don't

12:34.687 --> 12:36.990
have to eat our dinner
standing over a garbage can.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.292
Well, I'd love to,
but I have plans tonight.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.761
Well, what about a rain check?

12:41.795 --> 12:43.663
Yeah, purple rain check.

12:43.696 --> 12:46.166
"Purple Rain"--
that's a Prince song.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.167
It's my favorite...
You know what?

12:47.200 --> 12:48.268
We'll have a
listening party.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.302
Warning.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.105
Things could get sexy.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.373
(purrs)

12:56.343 --> 12:58.345
(phone ringing)

13:00.881 --> 13:02.782
Niles & Windsor Realtors.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.185
Yes, this is
Jane Forrest speaking.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.520
Yes, that house on Lindo
still is available.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.990
It has five bedrooms,
three and a half baths,

13:10.023 --> 13:12.192
and-and...

13:12.225 --> 13:15.662
and a pool that I wish
you would drown in.

13:15.695 --> 13:18.198
Are you kidding me?

13:23.236 --> 13:25.205
Why, thank you.
You're very welcome.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.142
Enjoy.
Thank you.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.720
I'm sorry, ma'am.
If you're going to do that,

13:40.753 --> 13:42.489
I'm going to have to ask you
to step into the ladies' lounge.

13:42.522 --> 13:43.891
No, thank you.
I'd prefer not to.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.158
It's just that what you're doing

13:45.192 --> 13:46.826
may make some of our patrons,
uh, uncomfortable,

13:46.860 --> 13:48.061
so if you wouldn't mind...

13:48.095 --> 13:49.496
Actually, I would mind.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.531
My breasts won't be silenced.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.200
And my breasts
are not alone.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.735
*

13:55.768 --> 13:57.837
* My milk shake brings
all the boys to the yard *

13:57.871 --> 14:00.007
* And they're like,
it's better than yours *

14:00.040 --> 14:02.175
* Damn right it's
better than yours *

14:02.209 --> 14:04.244
* I can teach you,
but I have to charge *

14:04.277 --> 14:06.046
* My milk shake brings
all the boys to the yard *

14:06.079 --> 14:08.248
* And they're like,
it's better than yours *

14:08.281 --> 14:10.217
Can I get security?
* Damn right it's
better than yours *

14:10.250 --> 14:12.685
* I can teach you,
but I have to charge *

14:12.719 --> 14:14.387
* I know you want it

14:14.421 --> 14:18.591
* The thing that makes me

14:18.625 --> 14:22.362
* What the boys go crazy for

14:24.131 --> 14:25.265
* I think it's time

14:25.298 --> 14:27.767
* La-la, la-la, la

14:27.800 --> 14:29.769
* Warm it up

14:29.802 --> 14:32.105
* La-la, la-la, la

14:32.139 --> 14:33.941
* The boys are waiting

14:33.974 --> 14:35.943
* My milk shake brings
all the boys to the yard *

14:35.976 --> 14:38.111
* And they're like,
it's better than yours *

14:38.145 --> 14:39.879
* Damn right it's
better than yours *

14:39.913 --> 14:42.382
* I can teach you,
but I have to charge *

14:42.415 --> 14:44.584
* La-la, la...
Bryan! Bryan!

14:44.617 --> 14:46.619
* Warm it up...
What are you doing?

14:46.653 --> 14:48.421
I'm helping.
Stop. Stop.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.623
I'm one of you,
united in a common cause.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.392
MEGAN:
I know that you think
that you're helping,

14:52.425 --> 14:54.461
but a man dancing around
with fake breasts

14:54.494 --> 14:56.463
just makes this whole thing
look like a joke.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.232
(babies crying)

15:04.737 --> 15:06.273
I'm just going to take
the check.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.446
What happened?

15:13.480 --> 15:14.614
The women at that protest.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.249
They're eager to stand up
for each other,

15:16.283 --> 15:18.118
but the second a guy
pulls out his boobs,

15:18.151 --> 15:19.152
they completely turn.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.887
And yes, when I say it out loud,

15:20.920 --> 15:22.122
I realize how ridiculous
it sounds.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.624
You know, my mother
never breast-fed me.

15:24.657 --> 15:25.959
Well, so what?

15:25.993 --> 15:28.228
A lot of people's moms
didn't breast-feed them,

15:28.261 --> 15:31.398
especially back in
the olden times.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.833
(scoffs)

15:33.866 --> 15:37.070
Just growing up, my mother
was always very...

15:37.104 --> 15:39.106
cold and distant.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.341
I felt more like

15:41.374 --> 15:43.676
an unwanted pet than a kid.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.081
Following her around
on my best behavior,

15:48.115 --> 15:51.118
hoping for attention
that rarely came.

15:52.519 --> 15:55.122
And I just keep thinking

15:55.155 --> 15:58.958
that maybe if she had nursed me,
things would be different.

15:58.992 --> 16:02.195
That maybe we would be closer.

16:03.796 --> 16:07.600
Bry...
the way your mom treated you

16:07.634 --> 16:09.602
has nothing to do with nursing.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.505
You think you're just
looking for an excuse?

16:12.539 --> 16:14.841
Something to blame it on?

16:14.874 --> 16:17.844
Well, if it wasn't
about nursing,

16:17.877 --> 16:19.712
it's about me.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.348
Was there something

16:21.381 --> 16:23.950
fundamentally unlovable
about me?

16:23.983 --> 16:27.387
Bryan, aside from the way
you wear your hair,

16:27.420 --> 16:29.356
you are nothing like your mom.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.890
(laughs)

16:30.923 --> 16:33.460
And you do not need
to breast-feed

16:33.493 --> 16:35.195
to feel close to our son.

16:35.228 --> 16:38.398
You'll sing him
funny, annoying songs

16:38.431 --> 16:39.966
when you rock him to sleep.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.534
You'll soothe him
when he's teething.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.704
Someday you'll even help
him study for a math test.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.074
No one said there'd be math.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.809
(chuckling)

16:49.842 --> 16:51.978
Please don't worry

16:52.011 --> 16:54.314
about not connecting
to our kid.

16:54.347 --> 16:58.218
You seize every opportunity
to engage in people's lives.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.320
Take a look at
this flash mob.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.590
Breast-feeding or not,
you are always going to be

17:03.623 --> 17:06.759
an overly intrusive,
meddlesome busybody.

17:06.793 --> 17:10.029
That's so sweet.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.499
Oh!
What? What?

17:12.532 --> 17:14.867
Your breasts are
leaking all over me.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.339
GOLDIE:
Shania?

17:19.372 --> 17:21.007
It's me...

17:21.040 --> 17:22.342
Mom.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.278
I know it's you,
and I don't want to talk.

17:25.312 --> 17:26.946
Look,

17:26.979 --> 17:28.281
we both did
some things

17:28.315 --> 17:29.849
that we're not so proud of.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.184
Drop the milk, Shania!

17:31.218 --> 17:32.219
Oh, I'll drop it all right--

17:32.252 --> 17:33.453
down my throat.

17:33.486 --> 17:36.356
Look! Piers Morgan
is going to the hospital.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.225
What?!
(siren blaring)

17:44.063 --> 17:46.866
I'm sorry I drenched us both,

17:46.899 --> 17:49.869
and for needlessly worrying you
about Piers Morgan.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.239
He has a history of high
blood pressure, Mom.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.306
I know that now.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.375
And...

17:55.408 --> 17:58.211
I also know this isn't

17:58.245 --> 18:00.313
about me not
breast-feeding you, is it?

18:00.347 --> 18:02.649
No.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.984
I'm just worried
that when the baby gets here,

18:05.017 --> 18:07.086
you're going to be
so busy with him,

18:07.120 --> 18:08.821
you won't have any time for me.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.558
Oh, sweetie,

18:11.591 --> 18:15.662
no matter how busy I am,
I'll always have time for you.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.063
You're my baby.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.931
My only baby.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.001
So, how much time
can you give me?

18:22.034 --> 18:24.271
Well, I don't know.
How much time do you want?

18:24.304 --> 18:26.439
30 minutes cuddle time
every night.

18:26.473 --> 18:29.008
30 minutes is a long time.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.778
How about we make it... 45?

18:31.811 --> 18:33.846
One hour,
and that's my final offer.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.248
Deal.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.683
(laughs)

18:36.716 --> 18:39.752
Is it okay if we start now?

18:39.786 --> 18:42.389
Yes.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.526
(sighs)

18:49.128 --> 18:50.663
Morning, Janey.
Good morning.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.265
You're a pig.
What?

18:52.299 --> 18:55.602
Low-fat turkey bacon,
egg whites-- 180 calories.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.137
But I'm glad that
you're judging me.

18:58.171 --> 19:01.708
You are like
every other pathetic,

19:01.741 --> 19:03.142
middle-aged man
I have met

19:03.176 --> 19:06.279
in this town who's convinced
the fountain of youth

19:06.313 --> 19:08.481
is hidden in some
20-year-old's panties.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.617
I guess that a mature,

19:10.650 --> 19:13.953
intelligent woman would be
too challenging for you,

19:13.986 --> 19:16.289
so you cavort with a child.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.124
Child? Wh...?

19:18.157 --> 19:19.459
What, you mean Amber?

19:19.492 --> 19:21.728
Yes, of course-- Amber.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.530
Everyone wants an Amber.
Yeah, I wanted an Amber.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.964
That's why I gave
her that name.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.334
See, Amber's not just a child;
she's my child.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.739
You have a daughter?
Mm-hmm.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.307
I understand
your confusion.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.409
I mean, a 25-year-old
man like myself

19:36.443 --> 19:38.678
having a 20-year-old kid?

19:38.711 --> 19:40.747
Look, Jane, I...
I like dating you.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.982
And I want to go
out with you again.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.553
But even if I was dating
some 20-year-old, so what?

19:46.586 --> 19:48.988
I mean, we're... you know,
we went on one date.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.858
We should be able to date
other people, right?

19:55.695 --> 19:58.998
Rocky, he said we're dating!

19:59.031 --> 20:00.533
ROCKY:
Really?

20:00.567 --> 20:03.002
Oh, my God, girl.
Be careful.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.537
Terrence Howard told me
the same thing

20:04.571 --> 20:06.673
right before he tried
to baby-wipe me.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.207
(Rocky laughing)

20:11.611 --> 20:13.580
IAN:
Hey, thanks for having us
over for dinner.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.382
Mmm. Are you kidding me?
Bryan insisted.

20:15.415 --> 20:18.385
He felt so bad about
ruining Megan's flash mob.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.752
God, who cares?

20:19.786 --> 20:21.554
You know, I never
thought I'd say this,

20:21.588 --> 20:23.623
but I'm sick
of women's boobs.

20:23.656 --> 20:26.259
Sick of hearing about them,
sick of talking about them.

20:26.293 --> 20:28.261
I have been telling you that
for years.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.797
And after Megan saw
that Milkman thing

20:30.830 --> 20:32.131
on Bryan, she was all,

20:32.164 --> 20:34.200
"Why don't you
want to feed our baby?

20:34.233 --> 20:36.403
"Why don't you want
to bond with our child?

20:36.436 --> 20:38.438
"Why can't you
be magical

20:38.471 --> 20:40.940
"and into being a dad
like Bryan?

20:40.973 --> 20:43.142
He's the perfect father."

20:45.144 --> 20:46.913
Yeah, I guess he is.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.815
(Sophie crying)

20:48.848 --> 20:50.483
All right.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.619
Take these out.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.421
Time to feed the baby.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.955
Come on.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.226
That's not Mommy's boob.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.462
It's Daddy's boob.
There you go.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.631
Did... did Bryan
give you that?

21:04.664 --> 21:06.299
No. Megan made me buy it.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.335
I got to admit,
I love it.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.169
We were, uh, going to tell
you that dinner was ready,

21:10.202 --> 21:11.471
but it looks like somebody
already got started.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.840
(laughs) Yeah.

21:18.345 --> 21:20.747
Now that I see it
with an actual baby,

21:20.780 --> 21:22.782
it does look stupid.
