[wings flapping]

00:28.236 --> 00:30.989
[energy crackling]

00:32.657 --> 00:35.910
What the fuck? What did Adriel do to you?

00:36.578 --> 00:37.829
He enlightened me.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.436
What the fuck?

01:02.771 --> 01:03.730
Are you doing this?

01:04.314 --> 01:06.274
It's Adriel's final plague.

01:06.357 --> 01:09.569
A burning light
that only scorches non-believers.

01:18.953 --> 01:20.080
Lilith.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.498
Come back to the OCS.

01:22.874 --> 01:24.042
They can help you.

Lilith, stop this.
Okay? Your sisters need you.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.613
My sisters?

01:53.696 --> 01:54.864
[Ava grunts]

01:54.948 --> 01:57.408
You want me to return
to a world I don't belong to?

01:58.159 --> 01:59.911
To fight a battle without hope?

02:01.621 --> 02:04.165
For the glory of a God
who has abandoned me?

02:08.128 --> 02:09.587

You should join us.

[Ava groans]

02:34.779 --> 02:36.406
-He likes you, Ava.
-[Ava coughs]

02:36.489 --> 02:38.199
That's why he hasn't killed you yet.

[ominous music playing]

02:39.951 --> 02:42.203

[softly] Lilith…

02:44.164 --> 02:45.498
-Please--
-[Lilith] No.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.500
-[Ava groans]
-No more talk.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.712
-Come with me.
-[Ava coughs]

02:50.795 --> 02:53.173
Adriel will give you
the freedom you've been seeking.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.676
You can finally be yourself
without fear of consequence.

02:56.759 --> 02:58.845
[Ava groans, breathes rapidly]

03:00.471 --> 03:01.306
No.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.558
This is not a negotiation.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.603
You will join the Halo to our cause,

03:07.353 --> 03:10.398
or I will rip it out through your chest.

03:11.107 --> 03:13.484
[breathing shakily]

03:13.568 --> 03:14.402
Never.

03:14.485 --> 03:15.570
Suit yourself.

03:15.653 --> 03:17.322
[Ava groans]

03:17.405 --> 03:19.407
You were right about one thing, Ava.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.659
[energy crackles]

03:21.743 --> 03:24.329
You are the last Warrior Nun.

[somber music playing]

04:05.453 --> 04:07.288
[Jillian] There's nothing more I can do.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.919
The ambulance is still ten minutes out.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.009
I'm sorry I couldn't save the Arc.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.429
I'm sorry I couldn't save you.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.890
[Superion] Soon I shall kneel before God.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.644
I hope He forgives my sins.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.897
He will embrace you as His champion.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.108
[Superion] Don't be so certain.

04:35.817 --> 04:40.154
A life is a long series… of mistakes.

04:40.238 --> 04:44.826
In every choice I made,
I… denied God's light.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.329
When the Halo rejected me, I resented Him.

04:51.749 --> 04:55.920
And when He chose Ava, I… resented her.

04:56.587 --> 05:00.008
You can't carry the entire weight
of the OCS on your shoulders.

05:00.091 --> 05:01.592
[Superion, weakly] No, you can't.

05:01.676 --> 05:05.722
I understood too late
the importance of my sisters.

05:06.931 --> 05:11.769
I let the scars and my shame
blind my vision.

05:15.648 --> 05:16.983
When you get to Heaven,

05:18.359 --> 05:23.031
God won't look you over
for victories or medals,

05:24.949 --> 05:26.034
but for scars.

05:27.577 --> 05:28.953
Take care of our girls.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.124
[Beatrice] I will.

05:34.667 --> 05:35.877
[gasping softly]

05:38.046 --> 05:39.213
[exhales gently]

05:42.842 --> 05:44.510
[Beatrice sniffling]

05:45.845 --> 05:47.347
[Beatrice cries]

05:51.476 --> 05:54.729
Let the Lord,
who frees you of sin, save you.

05:55.229 --> 05:57.273
[Beatrice cries] And raise you up.

05:58.900 --> 05:59.942
[Beatrice sniffles]

06:03.154 --> 06:04.697
[Beatrice crying]

06:08.159 --> 06:09.744
We did everything we could.

06:37.355 --> 06:38.314

-[Ava crying]
-[Superion gasps softly]

07:33.870 --> 07:36.789
[gasping]

07:36.873 --> 07:38.666
I haven't felt this way since…

07:40.376 --> 07:42.086
Since it was yours.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.048
-[Ava laughs]
-Yes.

07:46.674 --> 07:47.717
Thank you.

07:48.509 --> 07:49.635
[Superion sobs]

07:49.719 --> 07:52.388
[Ava and Superion laughing]

07:58.311 --> 08:00.271
-[Dora] This is a miracle.
-[faint birdsong]

08:00.354 --> 08:02.440
[Superion] I suppose,
as a former Halo-bearer,

08:02.523 --> 08:04.317
I still have a connection with it.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.861
It reached out for me.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.072
[sighs]

08:11.949 --> 08:13.159
We should pray.

08:15.286 --> 08:20.124
For Camila, Yasmine,
and everyone we've lost.

08:23.544 --> 08:24.629
To hell with that.

08:25.630 --> 08:26.547
Bea.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.049
I'm sorry.

08:29.258 --> 08:31.886
I'm truly grateful
that you're alive. I am.

08:31.969 --> 08:34.972
But Adriel is literally
sucking our prayers out of the air.

08:35.723 --> 08:38.226
I mean, who are we even praying to?

08:40.394 --> 08:41.395
Beatrice…

08:44.899 --> 08:46.400
[soft emotional music playing]

08:47.276 --> 08:48.277
[Ava] Beatrice.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.530
Talk to me.

08:53.324 --> 08:54.367
I lost the Crown.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.286
It was right there, and…

08:59.497 --> 09:01.541
I let my emotions blind me to the mission.

09:02.124 --> 09:03.501
You saved my life.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.711
But if I'd grabbed the Crown,
we could've beaten Adriel,

09:05.795 --> 09:07.463
and none of this would have happened.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.382
Camila, Yasmine.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.051
They might be here with us.

09:13.177 --> 09:16.973
So you're saying, if… if I had died,
the others might have lived.

09:17.056 --> 09:20.351
I'm saying that maybe
we're just… delaying the inevitable.

09:21.352 --> 09:22.353
No.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.856
The Beatrice I know never stops fighting.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.608
Never loses hope.

09:28.359 --> 09:29.360
No.

09:31.153 --> 09:32.196
She never did.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.448
Before.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.200
You said we would stop him our way.

09:36.867 --> 09:39.245
Together. That there's always
something else we can do.

09:39.328 --> 09:40.830
There is nothing else you can do.

09:42.498 --> 09:43.541
Run.

09:44.041 --> 09:44.875
Hide.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.336
Are you kidding me? I was hiding.

09:47.837 --> 09:48.838
[inhales sharply]

09:49.338 --> 09:52.258
Our only priority now is
to keep the Halo out of Adriel's hands.

09:52.758 --> 09:53.634
At all costs.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.431
[softly] Yeah.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.187
If I left,

10:06.772 --> 10:08.190
would you come with me?

10:10.276 --> 10:11.986
We could go back to the Alps.

10:13.487 --> 10:14.488
To the bar.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.825
Hans and the regulars.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.287
You could teach me how to dance.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.915
I could teach you how to drink. [chuckles]

10:27.001 --> 10:28.002
No.

10:29.545 --> 10:30.546
I can't.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.762
[emotional music swells]

10:41.599 --> 10:42.516
[music fades out]

10:50.858 --> 10:52.818
[pacing footsteps]

10:59.033 --> 11:02.620
[pacing footsteps continue]

11:05.081 --> 11:08.125
So, uh… I think we should exchange names.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.461
You know, for morale.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.465
-Morale?
-Yeah. I'm Todd.

11:16.008 --> 11:19.637
I would shake your hand,
but I'm a little tied up at the moment.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.263
-[Camila snickers]
-[laughs]

11:21.347 --> 11:22.515
That's terrible.

11:22.598 --> 11:24.350
Yeah, I know. But see?

11:25.393 --> 11:26.394
Morale.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.689
I'm Camila.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.107
Nice to meet you, Camila.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.442
Come here often?

11:36.112 --> 11:37.113
[Camila] First time.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.616
[clicks tongue] Kinda sucks.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.578
[wind blowing gently]

11:44.662 --> 11:47.540
[Jillian] Oh, I can't believe
you made it back in one piece.

11:47.623 --> 11:49.667
[Miguel exhales sharply, sighs]

11:50.793 --> 11:52.128
Tougher than I look.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.421
[Jillian exhales]

11:56.424 --> 11:57.383
[Miguel] Mm.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.593
[Miguel grunts]

12:00.511 --> 12:01.887
[Jillian sighs]

12:01.971 --> 12:02.972
Oh, my boy.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.307
-You're a man.
-[Miguel sighs]

12:11.439 --> 12:12.440
I, um…

12:13.983 --> 12:17.236
I reviewed the television footage
back at the cathedral.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.906
When you, uh…
When you reached out for Ava,

12:21.657 --> 12:22.491
you said,

12:23.868 --> 12:26.120
"We'll never get a better chance."

12:27.288 --> 12:28.789
Better chance to do what?

12:28.873 --> 12:30.416
[ominous music playing]

12:30.499 --> 12:31.792
I can't explain it.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.754
It's Reya, isn't it?

12:36.672 --> 12:39.467
Something happened when you looked at her.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.015
There's only one way to stop Adriel.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.601
That's why she sent me back.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.898
These women, they mean well,

12:55.524 --> 12:57.818
but there's no reason
for them to die for nothing.

12:58.569 --> 12:59.528
[Jillian sighs]

13:00.237 --> 13:01.363
I can end all this.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.037
By sacrificing yourself?

13:08.913 --> 13:10.539
[inhales, sighs]

13:11.874 --> 13:13.417
[gentle music playing]

13:14.585 --> 13:19.089
[sniffles] I think
you sacrificed enough, Michael.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.092
You can't stop this. No one can.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.010
[scoffs]

13:23.803 --> 13:24.804
Mum.

13:24.887 --> 13:25.971
[Jillian sniffles]

13:26.639 --> 13:29.600
Please… don't blame yourself.

13:29.683 --> 13:30.976
How can I not?

13:31.685 --> 13:34.063
There were forces at play
that we couldn't understand.

26:56.656 --> 26:58.366
I'm broken in body and soul.

27:00.785 --> 27:04.414
I have but one ember of hope
left in my heart.

27:06.666 --> 27:07.917
You, Ava.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.628
That's fucking great.

27:10.211 --> 27:12.964
You let the devil loose, and I have to put
the genie back in the bottle.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.050
-Come on.
-Well, technically…

27:15.133 --> 27:16.760
you let the devil loose.

27:17.427 --> 27:20.597
Yeah, because you lied to me.
Because you manipulated me.

27:21.264 --> 27:24.434
Yes, because you were innocent, naïve.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.521
Because you got your Halo by accident,

27:28.605 --> 27:31.733
I took it as a sign that you were
the key I could use to free Adriel.

27:32.609 --> 27:33.610
Fantastic.

27:34.778 --> 27:36.112
[Vincent] But I was wrong.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.659
I believe that you were chosen
by the Halo.

27:41.284 --> 27:42.994
I thank God it went to you and not Lilith.

27:44.496 --> 27:47.832
I believe that you, only you,
can restore the world.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.002
I really don't care
about what you believe in.

27:52.295 --> 27:55.090
What I need is to find a way
to take on Adriel alone,

27:55.173 --> 27:57.133
without risking
the lives of the people I love.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.469
Now, can you help me with that?

28:01.930 --> 28:03.682
The Crown is the key, Ava.

28:05.266 --> 28:06.559
Adriel is afraid of it.

28:07.143 --> 28:10.063
Yeah, 'course he is.
It got him locked up for a thousand years.

28:10.146 --> 28:11.940
[Vincent] No, it's more than that.

28:12.023 --> 28:15.235
It's something in the nature of the Crown
that he fears.

28:19.030 --> 28:22.701
Back in the day, before we freed him,
how did you talk to him?

28:24.452 --> 28:26.121
Through my divinium tattoos.

28:29.499 --> 28:30.500
Show me.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.298
[dramatic music playing]

28:43.596 --> 28:46.433
[dramatic music builds]

28:49.602 --> 28:51.354
[tattoos resonating]

28:51.438 --> 28:54.023
-[energy building]
-[Ava panting]

28:54.983 --> 28:55.984
[gasps]

28:56.776 --> 28:58.194
[music fades]

28:59.821 --> 29:00.822
[thumps]

29:07.871 --> 29:09.456
[Kristian gasps] The new Bible.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.126
Spread my word to the world, Kristian.

29:14.252 --> 29:16.463
-The people will be enthralled.
-Yes.

29:17.213 --> 29:19.132
Yes, I believe they will.

29:20.967 --> 29:23.261
[ominous music playing]

29:23.344 --> 29:27.223
[energy resonating]

29:27.807 --> 29:29.058
Vincent…

29:34.147 --> 29:35.774
And where did you run off to?

29:37.859 --> 29:39.152
Salvation.

29:40.403 --> 29:42.739
[high-pitched dissonant ringing]

29:42.822 --> 29:43.698
[groans]

29:47.327 --> 29:49.454
[Ava whimpers, gasps]

29:50.538 --> 29:51.706
[Adriel groans in pain]

29:52.499 --> 29:53.625
[Adriel groans]

29:53.708 --> 29:55.168
[Adriel screams]

29:55.251 --> 29:56.377
[Ava straining]

29:57.045 --> 29:58.379
[Ava grunting]

30:00.006 --> 30:02.050
[gasping]

30:02.133 --> 30:03.384
[pained grunt]

30:04.219 --> 30:05.929
Get out of my head!

30:06.846 --> 30:08.348
-[energy pulses]
-[Ava grunts]

30:10.183 --> 30:13.061
-[energy resonates, fades]
-[Adriel grunts, sighs]

30:13.144 --> 30:14.145
[Kristian] My lord…

30:14.229 --> 30:15.480
[Adriel exhales sharply]

30:17.732 --> 30:18.858
Leave me.

30:20.235 --> 30:21.236
[Adriel coughs]

30:22.070 --> 30:25.114
[Adriel grunting]

30:26.866 --> 30:27.826
[Adriel sighs]

30:27.909 --> 30:30.119
[Vincent breathing rapidly]

30:30.203 --> 30:31.329
Are you all right?

30:31.412 --> 30:34.290
[Vincent breathing shakily]

30:34.374 --> 30:36.626
[eerie music playing]

30:38.127 --> 30:39.337
I deserve this.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.550
[Vincent] What did you see?

30:45.051 --> 30:46.177
[Ava] You were right.

30:47.303 --> 30:48.972
Adriel is afraid of the Crown.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.475
Something inside it.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.394
Some… truth.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.313
I couldn't quite see.

31:01.276 --> 31:02.443
Do you think…

31:03.903 --> 31:05.071
[Vincent exhales sharply]

31:05.154 --> 31:06.698
[energy crackling]

31:06.781 --> 31:10.285
…embracing death
can lead to enlightenment?

31:10.368 --> 31:13.413
[eerie music builds, fades]

31:13.496 --> 31:17.333
[cell phone ringing]

31:18.710 --> 31:19.627
Hello?

31:19.711 --> 31:22.463
[Camila] Mother Superion. It's Camila.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.757
Camila! You're alive?

31:24.841 --> 31:26.634
So far, yeah. [sighs]

31:26.718 --> 31:29.596
Yasmine and I are in Adriel's Cathedral.

31:30.471 --> 31:31.723
She broke me out.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.225
Can you find a way out?

31:36.853 --> 31:38.021
We're not leaving.

31:38.605 --> 31:39.689
What's happening here

31:39.772 --> 31:42.442
is a blasphemy beyond blasphemy.

31:42.525 --> 31:44.944
You need to send everyone
to help us stop it.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.280
Bye.

31:47.363 --> 31:49.490
[dramatic music playing]

31:49.574 --> 31:50.575
Mother Superion?

31:51.284 --> 31:52.869
Camila and Yasmine are alive.

31:53.494 --> 31:54.704
They need our help.

31:56.122 --> 31:57.290
Go get the others.

32:01.210 --> 32:05.965
[energy resonating faintly]

32:09.052 --> 32:10.678
-[gun cocks]
-Step away from her.

32:11.429 --> 32:12.305
Get back.

32:12.805 --> 32:16.100
-[Vincent] Please listen.
-Michael, get that thing off of her.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.185
Stop.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.312
Ava chose this.

32:20.438 --> 32:22.190
She put the Crown on herself.

32:23.566 --> 32:24.567
It's true.

32:25.234 --> 32:27.362
She's searching
for a way to defeat Adriel.

32:28.321 --> 32:29.322
Beatrice…

32:30.198 --> 32:31.199
I don't know.

32:33.743 --> 32:36.913
[dramatic music builds]

32:59.560 --> 33:01.270
[distant clattering echoes]

33:15.159 --> 33:16.703
[music intensifies]

33:16.786 --> 33:17.745
[Ava gasping]

33:17.829 --> 33:19.372
[energy warbling]

33:19.455 --> 33:22.458
[shrieking]

33:22.959 --> 33:24.127
[sharp shriek]

33:24.210 --> 33:25.211
Okay…

33:25.294 --> 33:27.505
[dramatic music builds, fades]

33:27.588 --> 33:28.589
Come on, then.

33:30.383 --> 33:31.426
[music halts]
