WEBVTT

00:00.039 --> 00:00.994
<i>Previously on The Shield...</i>

00:01.199 --> 00:02.154
Shane?

00:04.159 --> 00:06.878
We're gonna find out who did this.
And we're gonna kill him.

00:07.079 --> 00:09.593
- Grenades.
- The El Salvadorans. Start there.

00:09.799 --> 00:12.108
It's Guardo. We stepped
on his drug protection twice.

00:12.319 --> 00:15.436
Nydia Hernandez? Someone
is planning on kidnapping you.

00:15.639 --> 00:18.756
- I should call Guardo.
- We don't know who's listening.

00:19.119 --> 00:20.108
We have to move you now.

00:20.319 --> 00:21.832
- We better get going.
- Okay.

00:22.039 --> 00:24.599
- What's this?
- It's the message I want you to deliver.

00:24.799 --> 00:26.152
- A necklace?
- You tell him...

00:26.359 --> 00:29.556
...if he ever wants to see her again,
he has 24 hours to get 50 grand...

00:29.759 --> 00:31.033
...in person, to L.A.

00:31.239 --> 00:34.595
Guardo wanted to have you killed.
You made up a story about Vic...

00:34.799 --> 00:38.428
...so that you could get witness
protection. Does that sound right?

00:38.879 --> 00:42.235
I fed her the story.
But I framed a guilty man.

00:42.439 --> 00:45.033
You're under arrest for interfering
in police business.

00:45.719 --> 00:47.198
Case against Vic
has been dropped.

00:47.399 --> 00:49.708
This just turned into a kidnapping.
Just let Nydia go.

00:49.919 --> 00:52.069
She's how we're gonna
get to Guardo.

00:52.279 --> 00:57.399
Every second he gets to breathe
and Lem doesn't is unacceptable.

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:08.079 --> 01:09.751
So how come no one's helping you?

01:09.959 --> 01:13.315
Helping me watch you?
I think I can handle it.

01:19.279 --> 01:21.270
- No calls.
- I need to talk to Guardo.

01:21.479 --> 01:23.788
People could be listening.
You could say something...

01:23.999 --> 01:25.751
...that could reveal your location
or his.

01:25.959 --> 01:28.519
I talk to him every day.
He'll get worried if I don't call.

01:28.719 --> 01:30.232
He might lower his guard
if you do.

01:30.439 --> 01:32.430
For all we know this could be
an inside threat.

01:32.639 --> 01:36.598
Until we know more, the less
he knows or hears, the safer he'll be.

01:36.799 --> 01:39.074
Besides, he's probably gonna call you
at some point.

01:39.279 --> 01:41.634
When he's alone. Right?

01:45.039 --> 01:46.313
Yeah.

01:46.879 --> 01:49.313
Well, then we'll wait for that call.

01:50.399 --> 01:52.708
Corrine. Hi. Everything all right?

01:52.919 --> 01:55.797
Yeah. Look, I know it's early
but I've been meaning to drop off...

01:55.999 --> 01:58.354
...these toys for Jackson.
Mara's expecting them.

01:58.559 --> 02:00.390
Yeah, come on in.

02:00.799 --> 02:01.868
Look at him.

02:02.359 --> 02:05.271
- I appreciate this.
- I didn't want them to go to waste.

02:05.479 --> 02:07.310
Oh, they won't. Trust me.

02:07.519 --> 02:11.353
Mara's showing a house,
so Daddy's stepping up.

02:11.559 --> 02:13.595
I heard Vic was cleared
of all the charges.

02:13.799 --> 02:16.267
Yeah. Kavanaugh planted
that evidence in Vic's apartment.

02:16.479 --> 02:18.197
Set the whole thing up.

02:20.359 --> 02:21.792
I opened the door to him...

02:21.999 --> 02:26.117
...when I told him about
all that extra money.

02:26.599 --> 02:29.033
If I'd kept my mouth shut...

02:29.239 --> 02:31.707
...I don't know, maybe Lem...
- Sweetie, no.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.875
Lem's not your fault.

02:34.479 --> 02:36.993
If it's anybody's, it's Kavanaugh's.

02:37.639 --> 02:40.107
And you didn't screw up, you know,
he crossed a line.

02:40.319 --> 02:42.469
But what's gonna happen
to Vic now?

02:43.199 --> 02:45.997
- Well, he's in the clear.
- But he's not himself.

02:46.399 --> 02:48.435
Yeah, well, how can any of us be?

02:48.639 --> 02:50.834
He's looking for the person
who killed Lem, right?

02:51.039 --> 02:52.791
He has to be.

02:53.679 --> 02:55.112
What happens if he finds him?

02:55.319 --> 02:58.231
I lost one of my closest,
most dearest friends.

02:58.519 --> 03:00.157
I'm not gonna lose him too.

03:00.359 --> 03:02.270
He's always been there.

03:02.479 --> 03:05.073
The kids,
they're so connected to him.

03:05.639 --> 03:07.391
Now it feels like all that's changed.

03:07.599 --> 03:09.590
It hasn't changed.

03:09.999 --> 03:11.512
It won't. I won't let it.

03:13.239 --> 03:14.194
Promise.

03:16.599 --> 03:17.714
Why am I trusting you?

03:17.999 --> 03:20.513
If you care about Guardo,
you'll play it my way...

03:20.719 --> 03:23.279
...otherwise you'll lead him
right to this killer, Salceda.

03:23.479 --> 03:25.993
- I've never even heard of Salceda.
- No reason you would.

03:26.279 --> 03:29.077
He wants Guardo's business,
he needs to eliminate him to get it.

03:29.279 --> 03:31.588
Guardo's strong.
Nobody can get to him.

03:31.799 --> 03:33.437
Not even the cartel?

03:33.639 --> 03:36.949
Salceda's Mexican. You really think
anybody's gonna complain...

03:37.159 --> 03:39.548
...when a Salvadoran gets replaced
by one of their own?

03:39.759 --> 03:42.876
- Guardo can take care of himself.
- Maybe I should let him do that then.

03:43.079 --> 03:46.674
Your boyfriend gets killed, that's one
less piece of shit I have to scoop up.

03:46.879 --> 03:49.871
One more murder notch for Salceda.

03:52.439 --> 03:54.191
Where are you going?

03:54.399 --> 03:56.276
- The bathroom.
- Fine.

03:56.639 --> 03:57.958
Leave the phone.

03:59.919 --> 04:02.114
The guy's the store manager.
The other two...

04:02.319 --> 04:04.275
...pharmacy tech and a cashier.
- Looks fresh.

04:04.479 --> 04:06.674
Suspects came in
as soon as the doors opened.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.756
Those three were the only ones
in the place.

04:08.959 --> 04:12.076
Took the employees, shot them.
Then cleared the ephedrine out.

04:12.279 --> 04:13.837
It's not the most original crime.

04:14.039 --> 04:16.348
Meth heads. Short on planning,
long on destruction.

04:16.559 --> 04:18.789
- That's one theory.
- You got another?

04:18.999 --> 04:21.752
Used to be these smash-and-grabs
were just users wanting to fix.

04:21.959 --> 04:25.713
Now that ephedrine's so locked down,
it's just as likely to be cookers.

04:25.919 --> 04:28.228
Yeah, well, we're waiting
for the owner to come down.

04:28.439 --> 04:31.511
- Then we'll see how much they got.
- Second multiple murder in a week.

04:31.719 --> 04:34.187
Wonder what the brass is gonna think
about my body count.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.629
Would be nice to close it.

04:36.959 --> 04:38.711
Spoken like a true captain.

04:39.959 --> 04:41.392
Hey, Dutch?

04:41.599 --> 04:43.829
- I owe you an apology.
- For what?

04:44.039 --> 04:46.314
For not embracing this partnership
sooner.

04:46.679 --> 04:49.512
Truth is, we're on the verge
of becoming a damn good team.

04:49.719 --> 04:53.155
- Well, I'm still making up my mind.
- Well, if you think about it...

04:53.359 --> 04:55.953
...your weaknesses are my strengths,
and vice versa.

04:56.159 --> 05:00.835
And, what exactly are my weaknesses,
Steve?

05:04.239 --> 05:08.551
Arrogance, overconfidence, inability
to give credit to those around you.

05:08.999 --> 05:10.876
I'm not telling you anything
you don't know.

05:11.079 --> 05:12.751
Anything else?

05:15.519 --> 05:18.716
You're afraid Claudette
was the better detective...

05:18.919 --> 05:21.991
...so you treat me like a piece of shit
because if we start tanking...

05:22.199 --> 05:24.918
...you can paint me as the guy
that dragged you down.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.516
Hey, you asked.

05:36.639 --> 05:39.437
Look, I've been rattling
this whole plan around in my head.

05:39.759 --> 05:41.829
I think we should step back
from this thing.

05:42.039 --> 05:44.792
Just from the girlfriend.
Just for a little while.

05:44.999 --> 05:46.717
- Step back?
- You were just cleared.

05:46.919 --> 05:50.036
We're all in the clear for the first time
in a very long time, man.

05:50.239 --> 05:53.993
Letting Lem's death go unanswered
isn't being in the clear.

05:54.399 --> 05:56.549
Besides, Nydia's in play now.
We're down the road.

05:56.759 --> 05:58.989
Tell her we found
the guy trying to kill Guardo.

05:59.199 --> 06:01.588
We'll put a little distance
between us and her...

06:01.799 --> 06:03.278
...wait for Guardo to get back.

06:03.479 --> 06:04.878
That's when we make our move.

06:05.079 --> 06:06.671
Guardo killed Lem
or he knows who did.

06:06.879 --> 06:10.076
I'm not scheduling payback
for later in the year.

06:10.279 --> 06:12.668
I'm just talking about
letting the dust settle, man.

06:13.239 --> 06:16.311
The department doesn't want this
case solved. It opens old wounds.

06:16.519 --> 06:18.794
Now, they hung Lem out to the press
as a dirty cop.

06:18.999 --> 06:20.830
That makes us the ones
to make it right.

06:21.039 --> 06:23.109
Wagenbach's gotten nowhere
in the investigation.

06:23.319 --> 06:26.834
Claudette's assigning him
to new cases. We owe it to Lem.

06:27.239 --> 06:28.877
It's on us.

06:30.879 --> 06:33.313
Guardo might call any time.
Go back to the Barn.

06:33.519 --> 06:35.908
Try to get us some heavier firepower.
We might need it.

06:36.119 --> 06:37.996
I have the day off.
What if Claudette asks?

06:38.199 --> 06:39.951
Just picking up
some more of Lem's stuff.

06:40.799 --> 06:42.073
Look, let's get this straight.

06:42.879 --> 06:44.710
We need the truth.

06:45.079 --> 06:48.469
This thing's gonna get a lot uglier
before it gets better.

07:00.799 --> 07:05.111
Shooters. Let's call them early 30s.
Doesn't look like they're tweaking.

07:05.639 --> 07:07.675
Made copies of this,
gave it to all the unis.

07:07.879 --> 07:10.234
Owner thinks they got
a dozen boxes of ephedrine.

07:10.439 --> 07:11.952
White guys. One of them has tats.

07:12.159 --> 07:15.231
We should see if they're Aryans,
bikers, whatever.

07:21.159 --> 07:22.433
Something else?

07:22.639 --> 07:25.233
This feels like a Strike Team case
to me. Drug world.

07:25.439 --> 07:28.636
Why not hand it off to them, put me
back on the Lemansky murder?

07:28.839 --> 07:31.751
- I thought you hit a dead end there.
- Guardo's out of the country.

07:31.959 --> 07:35.076
But a name keeps popping up
in my interviews. Hernan.

07:35.279 --> 07:36.758
- He connected?
- I don't know.

07:36.959 --> 07:39.951
Several of the Salvadorans mentioned
him. This guy's like a ghost.

07:40.159 --> 07:42.992
He's either got something to hide,
he's smart, or both.

07:43.199 --> 07:46.077
The Strike Team's been on
the sidelines since Lemansky's death.

07:46.279 --> 07:48.793
If you hear something on Hernan,
let me know. Otherwise...

07:48.999 --> 07:50.830
...try to clear this pharmacy murder
quick.

07:56.479 --> 07:57.912
You two still work here.

07:58.119 --> 08:00.075
Taking some personal days.
Sent you the memo.

08:00.279 --> 08:02.190
- You?
- Used mine up on my wisdom teeth.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.549
As long as you're still on the clock,
I need you.

08:04.759 --> 08:06.511
I'll just put these in the truck.

08:06.759 --> 08:08.750
Just came by to get
some things of Lem's.

08:08.959 --> 08:10.517
Saves me having to ask.

08:10.719 --> 08:12.471
We're short on lockers,
I'll need his.

08:12.679 --> 08:14.954
- We'll clear it out by tomorrow.
- How's Vic doing?

08:15.159 --> 08:16.478
We lost a friend.

08:16.679 --> 08:19.147
I understand,
but he still hasn't returned my calls.

08:19.359 --> 08:20.428
Well, he's been off duty.

08:20.639 --> 08:22.436
Soon as he can,
I want him back at work.

08:22.639 --> 08:24.914
I don't mean
on the Lemansky killing, either.

08:25.119 --> 08:26.677
- Don't worry about that.
- Good.

08:26.879 --> 08:29.632
And if Vic thinks he can
avoid my warnings by ducking calls...

08:29.839 --> 08:32.273
...tell him as far as I'm concerned,
he just got it.

08:33.279 --> 08:34.678
Have Ronnie find me.

08:34.879 --> 08:38.428
Hey, Dutch.
I don't know what this tattoo is.

08:38.639 --> 08:40.789
It doesn't match anything
on the books.

08:41.119 --> 08:44.030
Not Aryan Nation.
Looks like some kind of bird.

08:44.439 --> 08:46.714
Can't ID the tats.
Might be gang, but I doubt it.

08:47.879 --> 08:49.107
Ronnie.

08:49.319 --> 08:51.628
This is one of the suspects
in the pharmacy shooting.

08:51.839 --> 08:53.318
- You know him?
- No.

08:53.519 --> 08:55.157
What about the tattoo?

08:55.359 --> 08:57.714
Military. Navy, I think.

08:57.919 --> 09:00.956
A lot of these assholes get hooked up
punching a clock for Uncle Sam.

09:01.159 --> 09:03.798
Armed forces is second
to the joint as a recruitment centre.

09:03.999 --> 09:06.797
Stay with this one with Dutch
and Steve. We've got three dead.

09:06.999 --> 09:08.910
I want them
before they need more supplies.

09:09.119 --> 09:10.711
Okay.

09:11.879 --> 09:13.551
I don't need another person
to babysit.

09:13.759 --> 09:15.954
You said this was a Strike Team case.

09:16.159 --> 09:19.151
You got your wish.
Besides, keep your ears open.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.919
If Mackey and Vendrell
are looking for Lemansky's killer...

09:22.119 --> 09:24.587
...like I think, you might
get wind of it through Ronnie.

09:24.799 --> 09:26.755
- Let me know.
- Okay.

09:32.719 --> 09:34.437
Answer it.

09:36.919 --> 09:38.193
- Hello?
- Nydia.

09:41.879 --> 09:42.994
Give me that back.

09:43.279 --> 09:44.997
- I need to talk to him.
- Please.

09:45.199 --> 09:47.235
Just for a minute.

09:48.199 --> 09:51.350
You said you wanted to protect him.
To save his life, right?

09:51.559 --> 09:53.948
Then you gotta do things
my way, remember?

10:05.839 --> 10:08.069
- Talk.
- You know who I am, asshole?

10:08.279 --> 10:10.156
She's still alive, for now.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.998
But that's the last time
you get to hear her voice.

10:15.199 --> 10:18.828
You're a gringo. Who is this?
Are you mob? Russian?

10:19.039 --> 10:21.792
I'm the guy that decides
whether Nydia lives or dies...

10:21.999 --> 10:23.830
...and who her last lover is.

10:24.039 --> 10:27.668
- You touch her, you're dead.
- Oh, you got that all turned around.

10:27.879 --> 10:30.677
If I don't see you with the money,
she dies.

10:30.879 --> 10:33.552
- But not until she feels my soft touch.
- You stupid bitch.

10:33.759 --> 10:35.670
Next word out of your mouth
better be "when"

10:35.879 --> 10:39.110
Or I will rape and kill that bitch
while you're listening.

10:39.799 --> 10:41.278
When?

10:41.759 --> 10:43.112
Where are you?

10:43.319 --> 10:45.037
Near the border.

10:45.239 --> 10:46.558
MacArthur Park.

10:46.759 --> 10:50.957
The trash can by the lake.
Southeast corner. You got that?

10:51.439 --> 10:52.394
Yeah.

10:52.599 --> 10:53.873
How soon can you be there?

10:54.079 --> 10:55.990
Tomorrow. Maybe the next day.

10:56.199 --> 10:57.871
I know your business.

10:58.079 --> 11:01.276
You protect things. What do you think
the cartel's gonna think...

11:01.479 --> 11:02.514
...when they find out...

11:02.719 --> 11:06.189
...that you can't even protect
your own personal piece of ass?

11:06.399 --> 11:08.230
I can be there in three hours.

11:08.439 --> 11:09.394
Come alone.

11:09.599 --> 11:12.671
Once I got the 50 grand, I'll let
you know where you can find the girl.

11:12.879 --> 11:15.154
You don't come by yourself,
she dies...

11:15.359 --> 11:17.873
...and your protection business
along with her.

11:18.079 --> 11:19.307
All right. We're on.

11:19.519 --> 11:22.795
- Did you bring that backup?
- Yeah, but I lost Ronnie.

11:22.999 --> 11:26.355
He blew through his goddamn
personal days on his teeth.

11:27.279 --> 11:29.918
We're meeting with Guardo
in three hours.

11:31.119 --> 11:32.677
Look, just because Guardo's
coming...

11:32.879 --> 11:35.313
...doesn't mean he's not gonna
try to set us up too.

11:35.519 --> 11:38.829
We'll go to the drop-off point early,
make sure there's no trap.

11:42.159 --> 11:44.753
I have a call into
an Agent Jordan Zinman...

11:44.959 --> 11:47.951
...about a Salvadoran
named Hernan.

11:48.159 --> 11:52.596
It's important. He may be a witness
in the murder of a police officer.

11:53.199 --> 11:56.908
Okay. Just tell him I called.

11:57.599 --> 11:59.510
- Give it to him.
- Followed my military hunch.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.916
Checked records of guys who lost
benefits for felony convictions.

12:03.119 --> 12:04.871
Hit a hanging slider over the fence.

12:05.079 --> 12:06.353
We can wrap this up by dinner.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.790
The only thing bigger than Wyms'
body count is our closure rate.

12:12.399 --> 12:16.074
No access through the back, so
go around the side, cover the rear.

12:17.239 --> 12:18.308
You ready?

12:18.519 --> 12:20.316
Might wanna stay behind me.

12:29.439 --> 12:30.997
What's that?
Tommy, is that you?

12:31.199 --> 12:33.190
I have an arrest warrant
for Tom Franklin.

12:33.399 --> 12:35.310
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Is he here?

12:35.519 --> 12:36.838
- What is this?
- House is clear.

12:37.039 --> 12:37.994
Where is he?

12:38.199 --> 12:40.588
He works out in the garage a lot.
Might be back there.

12:40.799 --> 12:42.357
- Let's go. Move.
- Coming out!

12:45.439 --> 12:46.508
Go there.

13:00.199 --> 13:01.791
Not here.

13:03.039 --> 13:06.270
Dry ice. No fumes.

13:06.479 --> 13:10.108
- Yeah.
- All right, we're clear.

13:11.639 --> 13:14.392
- Who are you?
- His sister, Lisa.

13:14.599 --> 13:16.476
Know your brother
was cooking meth out here?

13:16.679 --> 13:18.397
He said he was fixing up an old car.

13:18.599 --> 13:21.067
- You see him this morning?
- He was gone before I woke up.

13:21.279 --> 13:22.837
How can we find him?

13:23.359 --> 13:25.634
Your brother killed three people
today.

13:26.559 --> 13:29.915
If he's not here,
who's gonna take care of me?

13:37.159 --> 13:40.390
Guardo's been in Mexico.
What if he was there when Lem died?

13:40.599 --> 13:42.510
Then he ordered it,
and he knows who did it.

13:42.719 --> 13:46.507
- How are we gonna know for sure?
- He'll give it up for his life.

13:49.279 --> 13:50.837
Nydia comfortable in the van?

13:51.039 --> 13:53.951
She's excited about her big reunion.

13:54.919 --> 13:56.796
Want me to go check on her?

13:56.999 --> 13:59.832
No. Just don't want her
getting too curious.

14:00.039 --> 14:02.507
Guardo's still two hours out.

14:03.319 --> 14:04.513
We'll do a head count now...

14:04.719 --> 14:08.268
...see if the population gets any
browner over the next couple of hours.

14:08.999 --> 14:10.990
Corrine came by this morning.

14:11.199 --> 14:13.633
Brought some toys for Jackson.

14:15.799 --> 14:18.791
But she really came by
because she's worried about you.

14:20.119 --> 14:21.950
About what you're gonna do.

14:23.159 --> 14:25.275
Where that leaves the kids.

14:26.719 --> 14:28.869
She mentioned the kids?

14:29.159 --> 14:30.717
Yeah.

14:33.599 --> 14:36.750
Well, when we finish up with Guardo,
I'll drop by.

14:38.719 --> 14:41.358
Listen, maybe you should
check on the girl.

14:53.239 --> 14:57.152
Tom Franklin's sister won't
or can't give up her brother.

14:57.359 --> 15:00.510
- Any ID on the other suspect?
- Not yet.

15:00.919 --> 15:02.875
Hello, sergeant. Welcome back.

15:03.079 --> 15:06.674
Thanks. We got another
pharmacy robbery on Western.

15:06.919 --> 15:08.910
- Anyone hurt?
- Just medicine cabinets.

15:09.119 --> 15:10.632
Took all the ephedrine in the store.

15:10.839 --> 15:12.591
Get out there
and see what you can find.

15:12.799 --> 15:14.152
Here we go.

15:14.879 --> 15:16.437
Claudette?

15:17.119 --> 15:18.871
- This is Skip Osaka.
- Hi.

15:19.079 --> 15:22.515
The department hired him to take
some publicity pictures of personnel.

15:22.719 --> 15:25.597
I thought the department
had that handled already?

15:25.799 --> 15:28.836
You know, why don't you get started.
Your pass gives you full access.

15:29.039 --> 15:31.348
Thanks. Is there someplace
I can set up my equipment?

15:31.559 --> 15:33.470
Pick an open desk.

15:34.519 --> 15:37.716
After Lemansky, they thought it was
good the department get some PR.

15:37.919 --> 15:41.070
We want this place to survive, so I
made sure the Barn gets its shot.

15:41.279 --> 15:43.713
The only good publicity I need
is lower crime stats.

15:44.519 --> 15:46.350
This campaign won't hurt.

15:46.559 --> 15:49.073
Now, they want some pictures of me
in uniform as well.

15:49.279 --> 15:50.598
Maybe some of you too.

15:51.039 --> 15:52.870
I'll work with him.

16:06.239 --> 16:09.072
- You see the two carloads?
- Circled twice. Hard to miss.

16:09.279 --> 16:12.157
We need an army, Vic. With the shit
these guys might be packing...

16:12.359 --> 16:15.590
...I 'm talking literally.
- We don't know if Guardo's in town.

16:15.799 --> 16:18.029
We'll wait and make sure.

16:19.319 --> 16:21.514
He rounded all the employees
and customers up.

16:21.719 --> 16:24.438
He brought them to the back,
then broke into the drug cabinets.

16:24.639 --> 16:27.517
He only took the ephedrine.
Left everything else.

16:27.719 --> 16:28.754
Just like this morning.

16:28.959 --> 16:31.519
That's Leticia Everett.
She's the assistant manager.

16:31.719 --> 16:32.754
Good job.

16:32.959 --> 16:35.632
Hi, Leticia.
Is this the man who robbed you?

16:35.839 --> 16:37.875
- One of them.
- What did the other guy look like?

16:38.079 --> 16:41.515
He's a white guy too. Looked like that
one. They could have been brothers.

16:41.719 --> 16:43.630
You see the car they came in?

16:43.839 --> 16:46.273
Are these the guys who killed
those people this morning?

16:46.479 --> 16:48.435
- Maybe.
- Why didn't they kill us?

16:48.639 --> 16:51.312
Stick around, okay?
We may need you a little more.

16:52.079 --> 16:53.831
- It's pretty crowded in here.
- Yeah.

16:54.039 --> 16:56.599
Probably didn't have enough bullets.

16:56.799 --> 16:58.551
I need to take this.

16:58.879 --> 17:00.790
- Yeah?
- He's good.

17:01.199 --> 17:02.996
Broke the thing damn open.

17:05.519 --> 17:07.794
- Hey, you still on that Claudette thing?
- Hip-deep.

17:07.999 --> 17:10.467
I'm trying to get in touch
with our Mexican Federale...

17:10.679 --> 17:12.431
...see if Guardo's crossing the border.

17:12.878 --> 17:14.835
Did you try him
through your wire connection?

17:15.039 --> 17:17.553
- No. I'm in the middle of something.
- I'm in a vacuum here.

17:17.759 --> 17:19.795
Can't you break away
for a couple of seconds?

17:19.999 --> 17:21.512
- When I can, I will.
- All right.

17:21.719 --> 17:24.517
- Let me know when things free up.
- Okay.

17:25.759 --> 17:27.271
Gardocki.

17:27.878 --> 17:30.632
- Thanks.
- Anything interesting?

17:30.839 --> 17:33.148
Tom Franklin came home.
Unis grabbed him up.

17:33.359 --> 17:35.350
- They're taking him to the Barn.
- Billings!

17:35.559 --> 17:38.517
Your buddy's got all the ephedrine,
left you holding the bill.

17:38.719 --> 17:41.552
He's got a knack
for avoiding the cameras.

17:42.799 --> 17:47.953
So all we've got is you committing
armed robbery and three dead bodies.

17:48.159 --> 17:50.115
The Berkeley law grads
in the DA's office...

17:50.319 --> 17:54.198
...are gonna be tearing each other's
eyes out to get this case.

17:55.759 --> 17:58.398
What if I said
that he killed those people?

17:59.359 --> 18:02.351
Well, that's... That's a start.

18:02.959 --> 18:04.836
I'd like to think that's the truth here.

18:07.079 --> 18:10.037
He's my cousin. Bobby.

18:10.359 --> 18:13.078
It was his idea. He made a deal
with some dude in the Horde...

18:13.279 --> 18:16.749
...to cook up 20 pounds of meth.
We never made that much before.

18:16.959 --> 18:19.792
Bobby knew some Mexican who was
gonna get us the ephedrine there.

18:19.999 --> 18:20.954
What happened?

18:21.159 --> 18:22.956
Wetback showed up
with a bunch of plants.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.077
Said ephedrine grows wild
down there.

18:25.279 --> 18:26.951
What the hell
were we supposed to do?

18:27.159 --> 18:28.592
So you started killing people?

18:28.799 --> 18:30.790
I told Bobby to back out of the deal...

18:30.999 --> 18:33.559
...but he got paid in advance.

18:33.839 --> 18:36.399
Blew most of his money on a Harley
and some new pussy.

18:36.599 --> 18:38.555
And hung you out to dry
with the Horde.

18:38.759 --> 18:42.195
No shit. Ripping off those pharmacies
was the only shot we had...

18:42.399 --> 18:44.276
...to cook up enough shit in time.

18:44.479 --> 18:47.232
I didn't know he was gonna kill
people until I heard the shots.

18:47.439 --> 18:48.474
How do we find him?

18:48.799 --> 18:50.027
New pussy lives in Van Nuys.

18:50.239 --> 18:53.788
If he's anywhere,
he's messing up the sheets with her.

19:02.639 --> 19:05.073
- Yeah?
- We got him.

19:09.919 --> 19:12.149
- Stay here.
- Again?

19:12.359 --> 19:16.557
For your own safety, okay?
Trust me. Stay down.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.635
Just like a bee to honey.

19:27.839 --> 19:29.511
- He dump the money?
- Yeah.

19:29.999 --> 19:32.149
He's got 10 guys
between us and him.

19:32.359 --> 19:34.350
Luckily, I don't give a shit
about the cash.

19:34.559 --> 19:35.958
He knows he's got heat on him...

19:36.159 --> 19:38.992
...so he's got a safe place to stay
until this thing's done.

19:39.199 --> 19:42.271
- What if he's not there alone?
- He's worried about his reputation.

19:42.479 --> 19:45.232
He's gonna make sure
he gets to those kidnappers.

19:45.439 --> 19:48.636
More guys he puts staking out the
money, the better his chances are.

19:48.839 --> 19:51.558
- Well, I've still got Nydia in the truck.
- Take her back home.

19:52.199 --> 19:53.951
I'll follow Guardo back to his hole.

19:54.159 --> 19:57.834
I figure we got a half-hour
before his guys start to get suspicious.

19:58.439 --> 20:00.748
- Call me when you get the location.
- lf there's time.

20:00.959 --> 20:03.951
I'm serious. Don't make your move
till I can be there to back you up.

20:04.159 --> 20:05.308
Just get the girl back.

20:16.799 --> 20:18.551
- Found Guardo.
- That's a relief.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.193
Last chance. I could use you.

20:21.399 --> 20:24.471
We're on a stakeout now.
Guy should be showing up any time.

20:24.679 --> 20:26.510
Our window's closing.
I'll call you later.

20:26.719 --> 20:28.277
Okay, be sure and do that.

20:32.639 --> 20:34.470
Everything okay?

20:34.679 --> 20:36.954
Be a lot better if Bobby showed up.

20:37.599 --> 20:40.875
How's Vic doing, by the way?

20:41.079 --> 20:43.798
He's okay. I talked to him yesterday.

20:43.999 --> 20:47.469
- He's dealing with things his own way.
- Sure.

20:47.679 --> 20:51.308
I was the first one to see
the holes in Kavanaugh's story.

20:56.719 --> 20:58.755
- Bike looks new.
- Units, get ready to move.

20:59.879 --> 21:01.517
Turn around, asshole.

21:01.719 --> 21:02.913
That's him. Move. Move.

21:09.519 --> 21:14.832
Hey! Quit it! Quit it! Get off of him!

21:16.639 --> 21:20.029
Roll over. Roll over!

21:21.559 --> 21:23.789
Now you'll roll over.

21:25.079 --> 21:26.592
Hold still, asshole.

21:27.159 --> 21:28.433
Get up.

22:05.279 --> 22:07.235
Right there. Right there.

22:12.839 --> 22:14.636
Officer.

22:14.999 --> 22:16.910
You're not going to find
anything here.

22:24.039 --> 22:25.950
I found what I want.

22:29.759 --> 22:31.477
Nydia.

22:32.599 --> 22:35.238
I brought the money.
I did what you said.

22:35.439 --> 22:37.714
You leave your guys at the park
as a welcome waggon?

22:42.199 --> 22:43.791
Too bad, you could have used them.

22:52.879 --> 22:55.632
What happened? Where's Guardo?
Your friend?

22:55.839 --> 22:59.195
Salceda was hiding at Guardo's place.
Vic's taking him in.

22:59.399 --> 23:01.708
So then where's Guardo?
You said he was back in town.

23:01.919 --> 23:06.197
Yeah, I guess the rumour was just that.
Good news is Salceda believed it.

23:06.399 --> 23:09.277
- He fell right into our trap.
- So he's safe?

23:09.479 --> 23:12.994
- We're safe again?
- Yeah.

23:19.359 --> 23:22.237
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Good luck.

23:23.479 --> 23:25.470
Don't judge me.

23:25.719 --> 23:27.118
I'm not.

23:28.159 --> 23:30.195
It's just...

23:31.039 --> 23:32.757
...I 'm pregnant.

23:34.239 --> 23:35.877
A month.

23:36.559 --> 23:38.675
I haven't told Guardo yet.

23:38.999 --> 23:41.877
That's why I quit smoking.

23:42.199 --> 23:44.759
Just that one I had
wouldn't hurt the baby, right?

23:44.959 --> 23:46.517
No.

23:46.839 --> 23:48.272
No.

23:48.879 --> 23:51.951
I just want my baby
to know his father.

23:52.359 --> 23:53.917
Yeah.

24:06.239 --> 24:08.799
We recovered the stolen ephedrine
and the murder weapon.

24:08.999 --> 24:11.797
- Music to my ears.
- Ronnie did a great job out there.

24:11.999 --> 24:14.149
He trusts the instincts
of people he works with.

24:14.359 --> 24:15.997
So I guess we're done, right?

24:16.199 --> 24:17.598
Let's get back out there.

24:18.399 --> 24:21.675
- What about the Horde?
- What about them?

24:21.879 --> 24:24.552
Well, the cousins are supposed
to give them the meth, right?

24:24.759 --> 24:25.714
There is no meth.

24:25.919 --> 24:28.308
We're not gonna make a deal
on a trio of homicides...

24:28.519 --> 24:29.918
...just to get us some dealers.

24:30.879 --> 24:33.393
Wait. The Horde doesn't know
there's no meth.

24:33.599 --> 24:34.668
Bobby's the contact.

24:35.319 --> 24:39.028
Say we offered them leniency
for his cousin who wasn't the shooter.

24:39.239 --> 24:41.548
- Maybe they'd go for it.
- He killed three people.

24:41.759 --> 24:43.317
Let's just turn it over to the DA.

24:43.519 --> 24:45.032
The Horde is impossible to crack...

24:45.239 --> 24:47.309
...because nobody wants
to be their enemy.

24:47.519 --> 24:49.237
We could bust them
with a lot of weight.

24:49.439 --> 24:52.511
If they don't get what they want,
they're gonna find another cooker.

24:52.719 --> 24:54.710
- Won't they?
- We'll use Bobby.

24:54.919 --> 24:56.671
Go through with the exchange
as planned.

24:56.879 --> 24:58.756
The Horde doesn't know
what Tom looks like.

24:58.959 --> 25:01.234
So we'll give them you instead.

25:25.519 --> 25:26.998
What do you want?

25:27.199 --> 25:30.669
I can get the money back.
Ten times that.

25:55.399 --> 25:57.469
Take me to a police station.

25:57.679 --> 26:00.193
I'm not going to say anything
without a lawyer.

26:28.439 --> 26:30.714
What do you want?

26:32.799 --> 26:34.437
You killed my friend a week ago.

26:34.879 --> 26:37.393
You tossed a grenade in his car
and blew his guts out.

26:37.599 --> 26:39.032
I don't know anything about that.

26:39.239 --> 26:41.434
I wanna know how you found him.
Who led you to him?

26:41.639 --> 26:44.107
- It wasn't me.
- Then you know who did it.

26:44.319 --> 26:45.513
Because you gave the order.

26:46.279 --> 26:47.871
Where's Nydia?

26:48.079 --> 26:51.754
- Did you hurt her?
- His name was Curtis Lemansky.

26:51.959 --> 26:53.677
He was a good cop.

26:53.879 --> 26:57.110
He was my friend,
and you killed him.

26:57.319 --> 26:59.469
All I want is to hear you say it.

26:59.679 --> 27:01.715
I've been in Mexico for two weeks.

27:01.919 --> 27:03.796
I wasn't near no cop getting killed.

27:07.999 --> 27:09.591
Your friend is making a mistake.

27:09.799 --> 27:13.712
You're gonna tell me how he got killed,
or you're gonna tell me who did it.

27:13.919 --> 27:17.389
Either way, you're not leaving this
place until I know every detail.

27:17.599 --> 27:21.069
I don't know anything. I told you.

27:21.439 --> 27:24.431
Maybe Nydia can help you
remember something.

27:25.039 --> 27:25.994
Don't hurt her.

27:26.199 --> 27:29.077
Don't make us hurt her, man.
Just tell him what he wants to know.

27:31.559 --> 27:32.708
Get her undressed.

27:35.479 --> 27:36.992
All right.

27:40.759 --> 27:41.714
It was Lino.

27:42.199 --> 27:43.552
Lino Prieto.

27:43.759 --> 27:45.750
- You gave the order?
- I didn't give any order.

27:45.959 --> 27:47.631
I heard about it in Mexico.

27:47.839 --> 27:49.352
My people were pissed off.

27:49.559 --> 27:52.278
Asshole brought shit down on us
without getting it sanctioned.

27:52.479 --> 27:55.198
- How did he find my guy?
- Ask him.

27:55.479 --> 27:57.868
Prieto's the one should
be hanging here, not me.

27:59.519 --> 28:03.194
If you're telling the truth, he will be.

28:14.679 --> 28:16.954
- Yeah.
- Pull up everything on Lino Prieto.

28:17.159 --> 28:18.353
I'll run it now.

28:18.559 --> 28:20.550
- What happened to Guardo?
- He's with Shane.

28:20.759 --> 28:22.636
- What'd he say?
- Had nothing to do with it.

28:22.839 --> 28:25.399
That this guy Prieto
went off the grid, acted on his own.

28:26.399 --> 28:27.912
Do you need something?

28:28.119 --> 28:30.235
- Yeah. It's time to go.
- I'll be right there.

28:30.439 --> 28:32.748
- Dutchboy still hounding you?
- Yeah.

28:32.959 --> 28:34.597
If Shane's with him,
how's he gonna meet you?

28:34.799 --> 28:36.790
Flying solo on this one.

28:36.999 --> 28:40.150
1731 Charles Street. Apartment 6.

28:40.359 --> 28:43.431
Why don't you wait? Wait, I'll get
freed up on this and I'll meet you.

28:43.639 --> 28:46.517
Can't slow down. Call me later.

28:47.399 --> 28:48.878
Sorry to keep everybody waiting.

29:02.879 --> 29:04.437
I'm a cop.

29:04.679 --> 29:07.637
- Lino Prieto?
- I'm his brother, Filberto.

29:07.919 --> 29:09.557
Let me see some ID right now.

29:09.959 --> 29:11.312
Come on.

29:17.919 --> 29:20.513
- Where's your brother at?
- He's in jail.

29:20.719 --> 29:22.437
Jail? Since when?

29:22.639 --> 29:24.436
Been almost a month.

29:25.199 --> 29:26.712
I told you, Lino ain't here.

29:26.919 --> 29:29.069
That's his wife, Margie.
These are his kids.

29:29.639 --> 29:33.552
Your brother goes to jail and you come
over here to keep his wife company?

29:33.759 --> 29:35.511
I came over to check on them.
That's all.

29:35.719 --> 29:38.517
Guardo Lima says that
your brother killed a friend of mine.

29:38.719 --> 29:40.516
- A cop.
- Guardo's a lying asshole.

29:40.719 --> 29:41.868
Doesn't mean it's not true.

29:42.079 --> 29:45.116
My brother was stupid to get
into the gang, but he wouldn't kill.

29:45.319 --> 29:47.150
- What's he in lockup for?
- Got drunk.

29:47.359 --> 29:49.350
Stole a car, crashed it into a store.

29:50.279 --> 29:52.235
Why would Guardo
give me your brother's name?

29:52.439 --> 29:55.158
They were tight. Ran together.
Guardo's girlfriend told him...

29:55.359 --> 29:57.554
...she thought my brother
was handsome.

30:02.359 --> 30:06.272
You keep this visit to yourself,
you'll never see me again.

30:10.239 --> 30:12.116
Maybe they won't show.

30:13.039 --> 30:14.757
Not likely.

30:15.959 --> 30:17.711
I like Ronnie.

30:17.919 --> 30:21.707
He's quiet,
but there's something there.

30:22.599 --> 30:25.318
Wouldn't mind doing
a little Strike Team time myself.

30:25.519 --> 30:27.874
Crawl into the shit.
Get the blood moving.

30:28.799 --> 30:32.109
Yeah. It's too bad
you get those headaches.

30:33.079 --> 30:36.628
You know, you're very sarcastic.
I forgot to list that one.

30:36.839 --> 30:40.434
You ready to hear a little
constructive criticism yourself?

30:40.639 --> 30:44.632
Are you kidding me?
I don't need that kind of head trip.

30:46.839 --> 30:48.591
Got three bikers coming in.

30:58.999 --> 30:59.954
What's going on?

31:01.919 --> 31:03.671
- Who's that?
- Tom.

31:03.879 --> 31:05.437
My cousin.

31:05.959 --> 31:08.757
You've been hard to reach.
You got a problem?

31:09.279 --> 31:11.349
You ordered a lot of shit, man.
It takes time.

31:11.559 --> 31:13.197
So let's see it.

31:23.039 --> 31:26.554
You know, if this works out,
we make this a regular thing.

31:27.959 --> 31:29.870
Hands. Hands!

31:30.079 --> 31:31.797
- Move in. Move in. Move in.
- I got him.

31:31.999 --> 31:34.035
- Get down! Don't move!
- Spread them! Get down!

31:34.239 --> 31:36.753
- Easy, man.
- Turn around.

31:36.959 --> 31:38.597
Turn around.

31:39.679 --> 31:41.032
Get...

31:41.239 --> 31:43.309
Spread them. Spread them.
Don't move.

31:44.839 --> 31:47.399
All clear. We got them all.

31:47.599 --> 31:48.714
Nice operation.

31:48.919 --> 31:51.479
Thanks for making me look good
to the captain.

31:53.919 --> 31:55.432
- Way to go, Billings.
- Thanks.

31:56.119 --> 31:58.189
- No biggie.
- Hey. Right on.

31:58.399 --> 31:59.991
Hey, great job out there.

32:00.199 --> 32:02.633
You were the one with the idea
of taking down the Horde.

32:02.839 --> 32:06.388
I guess the tutoring is paying off.
So when's the next lesson?

32:06.599 --> 32:10.956
I got a little more to do here. But if you
wanna stick around, I'll be here.

32:11.159 --> 32:12.114
Okay.

32:12.319 --> 32:14.833
I gotta go. Can you and Billings
cover me on the paperwork?

32:15.039 --> 32:16.552
- I guess.
- Thanks, I owe you one.

32:16.759 --> 32:17.908
Good work today.

32:18.119 --> 32:20.030
Tina, good job.

32:24.799 --> 32:26.027
You're the man.

32:27.879 --> 32:29.392
Hey.

32:29.879 --> 32:31.551
Let me go.

32:32.439 --> 32:33.952
Please.

32:34.439 --> 32:36.589
Shut up, shithead.

32:38.479 --> 32:40.037
I didn't do it.

32:40.239 --> 32:41.797
I swear.

32:41.999 --> 32:43.591
He's got the wrong guy.

32:43.799 --> 32:46.472
Yeah, I know.

32:46.679 --> 32:49.239
Lino Prieto did it, right?

32:53.719 --> 32:55.755
I'll give info on the gang.

32:55.959 --> 32:58.234
You could take down
the whole crew.

33:00.039 --> 33:01.518
I didn't kill that cop!

33:01.719 --> 33:04.597
Yeah, well, you killed
a shitload of other people.

33:06.079 --> 33:09.230
What about that little backyard
barbecue you and your boys blew up?

33:10.879 --> 33:12.153
Those were kids, man.

33:12.359 --> 33:15.590
Your grenades blew holes in them
I could goddamn see through.

33:15.799 --> 33:18.518
I had to walk through their blood.

33:19.639 --> 33:20.913
Money.

33:21.439 --> 33:22.872
I'll give you money.

33:23.079 --> 33:24.990
Make you rich.

33:25.399 --> 33:26.991
What do you want?

33:27.199 --> 33:28.757
Peace.

33:30.039 --> 33:31.552
I know you're interested.

33:31.759 --> 33:34.751
I wouldn't be here
if you were a straight-up cop.

33:38.799 --> 33:40.391
Tell him I escaped.

33:40.599 --> 33:43.477
- You could retire tomorrow.
- Sorry, man.

33:43.679 --> 33:46.398
I don't like the way
blood money spends.

33:53.719 --> 33:54.947
Nydia's pregnant.

33:55.759 --> 33:58.398
Thought you should know
she's gonna have your kid.

34:09.239 --> 34:11.958
Lino Prieto's been in jail
for the last three and a half weeks.

34:16.958 --> 34:18.074
Come on, Vic, man...

34:18.279 --> 34:20.031
So all I got...

34:20.599 --> 34:22.112
...is you.

34:30.319 --> 34:32.435
How did you find my guy?

34:33.879 --> 34:35.755
Was it Emolia?

34:35.958 --> 34:37.438
Kavanaugh?

34:37.639 --> 34:38.788
How?

34:43.399 --> 34:45.549
- I'm gonna get to the truth.
- I didn't do it!

34:45.759 --> 34:47.636
I didn't...

34:48.918 --> 34:50.511
I didn't...

34:54.599 --> 34:55.873
Get anything from Gardocki?

34:56.079 --> 34:58.991
Nothing specific. Couple of phone
calls he didn't want me to hear.

34:59.199 --> 35:00.393
It could've been anything.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.318
And how are you adjusting
working with Billings?

35:03.959 --> 35:05.711
It's fine.

35:06.159 --> 35:08.434
It's just not the same, that's all.

35:11.239 --> 35:13.116
How's your mystery Salvadoran?

35:13.319 --> 35:15.674
Hernan. Nothing.

35:15.879 --> 35:18.154
But I'm free to look for him.

35:20.479 --> 35:25.109
When we were... We were partners,
I pulled my weight, right?

35:25.319 --> 35:27.594
I mean, you never felt
like you were...

35:27.799 --> 35:29.676
...carrying me or anything, did you?

35:30.679 --> 35:32.556
You made me a better detective.

35:32.759 --> 35:34.715
You'll make Billings one too.

35:36.079 --> 35:38.468
Yeah. Yeah.

35:46.239 --> 35:48.434
Hey. Hey.

35:48.639 --> 35:51.472
Just tell me what I wanna know
and this will be over.

35:56.799 --> 35:58.915
Who else was involved?

35:59.799 --> 36:01.152
- Who?
- I don't know nothing.

36:01.359 --> 36:03.236
Come on, man. He's not talking.

36:03.439 --> 36:07.148
He will. He'll talk.

36:07.599 --> 36:10.989
Who was it?
Did a black cop get in touch with you?

36:11.199 --> 36:13.872
Kavanaugh? David Aceveda?

36:14.399 --> 36:15.468
It was Emolia, wasn't it?

36:15.679 --> 36:18.477
It was that Salvadoran slut
tipped you off, I know it.

36:18.679 --> 36:20.032
You know, maybe he didn't do it.

36:20.239 --> 36:22.799
- lf it wasn't Guardo, who else was it?
- Look at him, man.

36:22.999 --> 36:25.274
If he had a name,
he would have told us by now.

36:25.479 --> 36:28.198
- That just means he was acting alone.
- Come on. This is crazy.

36:28.399 --> 36:30.549
He killed Lem!

36:30.879 --> 36:32.790
Don't you remember his body?
His face?

36:32.999 --> 36:36.071
You think you can just forget that?

36:36.279 --> 36:39.589
Don't you think he deserves to die
for what he did?

36:42.159 --> 36:44.992
Look, I'm asking you not to do this
for me.

36:46.399 --> 36:47.514
Why not?

36:49.279 --> 36:50.678
Look, he's got money.

36:50.879 --> 36:53.712
A lot more than that ransom.
He offered me some to let him go.

36:53.919 --> 36:57.628
- Gonna put a price on Lem's life?
- No, man, come on.

36:57.839 --> 37:00.876
No. But it... I mean, it always
comes down to the same thing.

37:01.079 --> 37:02.910
Our families. Our futures.

37:03.119 --> 37:04.791
- Taking care of all that.
- We will.

37:04.999 --> 37:07.229
I'm glad your friend died.

37:07.439 --> 37:09.634
Hey, hey. Hey, listen to me.
Listen to me.

37:09.839 --> 37:11.318
Look. Look, you kill him... -

37:11.519 --> 37:14.909
You kill him, you cut off our chance
of ever finding out the truth.

37:15.119 --> 37:19.635
I want every single person who had a
hand in this to suffer, not just Guardo.

37:33.079 --> 37:34.592
Thank you.

38:09.479 --> 38:11.435
You were right.

38:11.639 --> 38:14.472
If he had a real name to tell us,
he would have.

38:14.799 --> 38:16.915
He acted alone.

38:33.439 --> 38:34.838
So what now?

38:35.039 --> 38:37.553
We make sure
this body never gets found.

38:37.759 --> 38:41.229
As long as Guardo's at large, he'll
remain the suspect in Lem's death.

38:42.559 --> 38:44.117
We just killed somebody.

38:54.439 --> 38:56.669
Detective work isn't as sexy...

38:56.879 --> 38:59.632
...but it's where brainpower like yours
really gets utilised.

38:59.839 --> 39:02.797
One of the things you should
start doing is making a library.

39:02.999 --> 39:05.388
Copy interesting cases.
Things you don't wanna forget.

39:05.599 --> 39:08.113
Take them home, organise them,
you can look through them.

39:08.319 --> 39:11.436
- Yeah, that's really smart.
- Train your brain.

39:11.639 --> 39:12.992
Always be asking questions.

39:13.199 --> 39:16.714
Think like a detective about everything
in your life, every second.

39:16.919 --> 39:18.989
And you have something like that?
A library?

39:19.199 --> 39:21.235
I've compiled folders
over the last decade.

39:21.439 --> 39:23.077
Pictures, notes, theories.

39:23.279 --> 39:25.474
Keep them at home.
I'll show them to you sometime.

39:25.679 --> 39:28.591
- Give you an idea how to organise it.
- It's still early.

39:36.799 --> 39:38.278
I can order some Chinese food.

39:38.479 --> 39:41.471
Got a great bottle of wine
I've been waiting to open.

39:43.479 --> 39:44.594
What?

39:45.479 --> 39:47.993
Is this a date?

39:50.519 --> 39:53.750
I don't know. I don't know.
Do you want it be?

39:57.559 --> 39:59.311
Do you have a girlfriend
or something?

39:59.519 --> 40:01.191
No. No, why?

40:01.399 --> 40:04.596
Because there's a woman
on your porch watching us.

40:05.559 --> 40:06.992
- Stay here.
- Dutch, I'm a cop.

40:07.199 --> 40:09.394
Just give me a second.

40:10.399 --> 40:11.514
Can I help you?

40:11.719 --> 40:14.517
I'm Agent Zinman. ICE.
You left me a message?

40:14.879 --> 40:18.076
- You have information about Hernan?
- Can you lose your date?

40:57.319 --> 40:59.753
Hernan is undercover
in the Salvadoran organisation.

40:59.959 --> 41:02.632
He's infiltrated that group
deeper than anyone in the system.

41:02.839 --> 41:04.557
I can't compromise his position.

41:04.759 --> 41:07.319
I don't want to compromise.
I just want to ask questions.

41:07.519 --> 41:10.670
Find another intel source
and stop trying to contact him.

41:10.879 --> 41:12.107
I don't think so.

41:12.319 --> 41:14.196
A cop was killed by the Salvadorans.

41:14.399 --> 41:16.913
You say your guy's inside,
I'm gonna need to talk to him...

41:17.119 --> 41:19.269
...to get the information I need
to solve this.

41:19.479 --> 41:21.868
I know you're investigating
the murder of an officer...

41:22.079 --> 41:23.558
...and you're looking for Guardo.

41:23.759 --> 41:25.112
But he didn't commit that crime.

41:25.519 --> 41:26.872
He... He undercover too?

41:27.079 --> 41:29.115
According to Hernan,
he was out of the country.

41:29.319 --> 41:32.231
I know he was out of the country.
Doesn't mean he didn't order it.

41:32.439 --> 41:34.509
Killer used a grenade.
Guardo's calling card.

41:34.719 --> 41:36.152
Guardo is back in Los Angeles.

41:36.359 --> 41:37.314
According to Hernan...

41:37.519 --> 41:40.397
...it would take something important
to bring him out of hiding.

41:40.599 --> 41:43.477
Focus your effort there,
but leave Hernan out of it.

41:43.679 --> 41:45.556
- Can I use him to find Guardo?
- No.

41:45.759 --> 41:47.556
Hernan is too valuable
to the government.

41:47.759 --> 41:51.388
This isn't a pissing contest.
It's an order.

41:58.399 --> 42:01.789
Guy ever clean this thing out?
It's like being back in high school.

42:03.279 --> 42:05.668
- Hey.
- Remember when he took that?

42:05.879 --> 42:08.996
Disposable we took from that dealer.
Last shot.

42:09.199 --> 42:12.714
- Almost got the case thrown out.
- Tampering with evidence. Shit.

42:13.639 --> 42:16.358
- Here. You take it.
- I don't need it.

42:16.559 --> 42:17.833
Looks like you do.

42:23.519 --> 42:25.430
Look who's here. How you doing?

42:25.639 --> 42:28.233
Just had my first
good night's sleep in a while.

42:28.439 --> 42:29.792
Just tell me where you need me.

42:29.999 --> 42:32.069
You still have a few days
of personal time left.

42:32.279 --> 42:34.509
Don't need them.
Looking forward to getting back in.

42:34.719 --> 42:36.755
- I'll be glad to accommodate.
- Whose jacket?

42:36.959 --> 42:39.519
It's Kevin Hiatt.
He used to be a rising star at INS.

42:39.719 --> 42:43.075
When Homeland Security took over
he thought the room got crowded.

42:43.279 --> 42:46.351
Department's had him for over a year.
He's ours starting next week.

42:46.559 --> 42:47.594
I'll look over it.

42:47.799 --> 42:50.871
But you're not adding anybody to
my team that I don't have approval of.

42:51.079 --> 42:53.354
He's not your addition.
He's your replacement.

42:53.559 --> 42:55.914
You've only got a month
before your 15 and you retire.

42:56.119 --> 42:57.996
Unless my math's wrong.

42:58.479 --> 43:00.037
I need you to get him up to speed.

43:00.559 --> 43:02.868
- A lot can happen in a month.
- True enough.

43:03.079 --> 43:05.877
But Hiatt sounds like a solid guy.
Give him a call.

43:06.079 --> 43:08.593
I really need you to help him
with his transition.

43:10.999 --> 43:13.718
Like I said, wherever you need me.

43:14.305 --> 43:20.945
