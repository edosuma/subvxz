- DAVE: Cut, cut! Cut, cut!
- EMMA: Dave,
we're already behind.

01:43.551 --> 01:45.153
- Cut, cut, cut.
- Let's get ready
to go again please.

01:45.153 --> 01:46.456
- MAN: Right away, everybody!
- Okay, right now,

01:46.456 --> 01:47.692
you're making this
super lowbrow face

01:47.692 --> 01:48.728
when you're grabbing
her breasts.

01:48.728 --> 01:50.498
Opposite energy. It's emotional.

01:50.498 --> 01:51.533
This is the love of your life,
not some little slut.

01:51.533 --> 01:53.403
You guys are doing really great.

01:53.403 --> 01:55.240
We're just looking for some
levels. Like, the intension...

01:55.240 --> 01:56.142
Guys, please, please, I got
to talk to you for a second.

01:56.142 --> 01:57.277
Play it cool. Cool.

01:57.277 --> 01:58.547
ACTOR:
So, like, cooler, right?

01:58.547 --> 02:00.183
Not "cool."
Not cool in that way.

02:00.183 --> 02:01.787
- These kids fucking suck.
- I know. It's like...

02:01.787 --> 02:03.758
the talent pool in Philadelphia
is fucking atrocious.

02:03.758 --> 02:05.193
That's what I told you.
That's exactly what I said.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.462
- Well...
- But you wanted to shoot here.

02:06.462 --> 02:08.300
You wanted to make it real, so...

02:08.300 --> 02:09.770
It's my parents' house,
where all this shit happened...

02:09.770 --> 02:11.472
Dave, Dave, Dave.
I need to speak to you,

02:11.472 --> 02:12.809
'cause it's actually--
it's kind of urgent.

02:12.809 --> 02:14.513
Look, here's the deal.

02:14.513 --> 02:15.815
Eighth-grade Dave hasn't
logged enough school hours,

02:15.815 --> 02:17.451
which means he's gonna
get pumpkined,

02:17.451 --> 02:19.589
which means I have
to pull him for two hours.

02:19.589 --> 02:21.560
We can't be in this scene
in two more hours.

02:21.560 --> 02:23.196
- We're already two hours behind.
- I understand. I understand.

02:23.196 --> 02:24.298
But in order to get
all the Daves together

02:24.298 --> 02:25.400
for the Evolution of Man scene,

02:25.400 --> 02:26.904
I had to stagger
their schooling.

02:26.904 --> 02:28.908
- You understand? So he's...
- So what's the solution?

02:28.908 --> 02:30.177
- What's the solution?
- Well, the only thing
I can think of

02:30.177 --> 02:31.747
is that we have Toddler Dave.

02:31.747 --> 02:33.751
He's available to work
right now. Wait, copy that...

02:33.751 --> 02:35.621
- DAVE: Toddler Dave?
- Steph, can you cover for me, please?

02:35.621 --> 02:36.924
It's a spin the bottle scene.
Like-like, you can't have, like,

02:36.924 --> 02:38.393
an eighth grader
get fondled by toddler.

02:38.393 --> 02:39.930
EMMA:
You said you wanted abstract.

02:39.930 --> 02:41.700
Can we have the intimacy
coordinator over here, please?

02:41.700 --> 02:43.169
- No, that's not the...
- We need to know if a toddler

02:43.169 --> 02:44.873
can touch
our eighth grader's breasts.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.944
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Please, like,
we're just spitballing here.

02:46.944 --> 02:48.714
- Let us have a conversation.
- Copy. 86 on the intimacy coordinator.

02:48.714 --> 02:50.450
- They're just spitballing.
- You got to realize, like,

02:50.450 --> 02:52.187
the reason I'm making this video
right now is to engage

02:52.187 --> 02:53.758
a female fan base that I don't
even currently have.

02:53.758 --> 02:55.427
Like, ticket sales on this tour
are not going well.

02:55.427 --> 02:56.830
Look at my fan base right now.
It's all dudes.

02:56.830 --> 02:58.466
- (crowd cheering)
- Hi, guys. Good to see you.

02:58.466 --> 03:00.303
And I certainly, like,
I love these people,

03:00.303 --> 03:01.974
but it's like we're not even
tapping into half the world.

03:01.974 --> 03:03.978
So people need to see
my sensitivity at some point.

03:03.978 --> 03:05.414
Yeah, and they're not
gonna see anything

03:05.414 --> 03:06.517
if you don't finish
the video today.

03:06.517 --> 03:08.253
We leave Philly tomorrow, so...

03:08.253 --> 03:09.756
- figure it out, Dave.
- I know. I'm working on it.

03:09.756 --> 03:11.794
But, like, I assume
our female director has a P. O. V.

03:11.794 --> 03:13.631
on not wanting
the main character of the video

03:13.631 --> 03:15.233
- to act like a fucking animal,
you know?
- Oh, my God.

03:15.233 --> 03:16.570
Guys, you're both right.

03:16.570 --> 03:18.273
We can cut around the face
and move on.

03:18.273 --> 03:19.509
- Cut around the face?
- Great. Yes.

03:19.509 --> 03:20.912
- Mm-hmm?
- Emma, good call. Let's move on.

03:20.912 --> 03:22.615
Okay. I got to go to playback
to understand...

03:22.615 --> 03:24.351
- Dave.
- STEPH: Dave's walking
to playback.

03:24.351 --> 03:25.722
- Cut around the face?
- Dave, if we don't move on,

03:25.722 --> 03:27.224
we're gonna lose the light
for the bus stop.

03:27.224 --> 03:28.226
Emma, it's my romantic
origin story.

03:28.226 --> 03:29.529
They have to see the love,

03:29.529 --> 03:30.898
the heartbreak,
all that, you know?

03:30.898 --> 03:32.401
If you didn't know
Batman's origin story,

03:32.401 --> 03:33.436
he'd be just a guy
who, like, beats--

03:33.436 --> 03:34.706
Can I see playback on that?

03:34.706 --> 03:35.975
Ready to do a test
on the cum rig?

03:35.975 --> 03:37.812
Not now, John.
Play it back, Lonny?

03:37.812 --> 03:39.649
John, John, John, that's for
the coming the pants scene?

03:39.649 --> 03:41.520
- Yeah.
- Why is it a boner?

03:41.520 --> 03:42.889
Like, I was totally soft
when I came.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.760
Totally soft?
Like, no blood at all?

03:44.760 --> 03:46.329
Yeah, exactly.
Like, people have seen scenes

03:46.329 --> 03:47.832
where guys cum their pants.

03:47.832 --> 03:49.503
This is trauma
because I came soft.

03:49.503 --> 03:50.972
I mean, I essentially
pissed cum.

03:50.972 --> 03:53.276
Maybe I can hollow this out.
It'll hang soft...

03:53.276 --> 03:54.579
- EMMA: Just watch playback.
- I don't need, like,
an indentation.

03:54.579 --> 03:56.249
I used to call my dick
a "life crouton."

03:56.249 --> 03:57.652
- I was jerking off to TRL...
- CAROL: David?

03:57.652 --> 03:59.623
David, can I see you
for a second, please?

03:59.623 --> 04:01.259
- Yeah.
- There's blue tape
all over the living room walls.

04:01.259 --> 04:02.829
I never said you could
use tape on my walls.

04:02.829 --> 04:04.699
DAVE:
Okay, it's designed to come off.

04:04.699 --> 04:06.402
- Your house is gonna be fine.
- These fucking hearing aids.

04:06.402 --> 04:07.772
We just repainted.

04:07.772 --> 04:09.643
Those walls are smooth
as lacquer.

04:09.643 --> 04:11.513
- Okay. It's gonna be okay.
- LONNY: Did she say lacquer?

04:11.513 --> 04:14.719
- Huh?
- Is there lacquer?

04:14.719 --> 04:16.055
I don't know.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.792
Can I see playback?

04:17.792 --> 04:19.028

04:21.834 --> 04:23.571

04:23.571 --> 04:25.340
Well, it's not supposed to be,
so that's a failure.

04:25.340 --> 04:26.677
- Oh...
- 'Cause-- I'm serious.

04:26.677 --> 04:27.946
It's like, this sucks.

04:27.946 --> 04:29.048
These kids are never
gonna be able

04:29.048 --> 04:30.685
to inhabit my actual headspace.

04:30.685 --> 04:32.555
I wish I could be in this video.

04:32.555 --> 04:35.293
Yeah, well, it's too bad that no
one wants to see a 30-year-old

04:35.293 --> 04:37.565
- grope an eighth grader,
so new plan.
- I get it!

04:37.565 --> 04:39.335
I totally get it.
We're hamstrung to these kids.

04:39.335 --> 04:41.005
So at this point, it's like,
what generation of Dave

04:41.005 --> 04:43.577
actually has the most
sensitivity, of all our actors?

04:43.577 --> 04:46.315
For me, it's that guy Helhim.
Can we get Helhim out here?

04:46.315 --> 04:48.052
- He at least can be directed.
- Who's Helhim?

04:48.052 --> 04:49.756
Helhim. Uh, I don't know.

04:49.756 --> 04:51.593
Young Dave, one of them.
Like, Helhim.

04:51.593 --> 04:53.564
He had a name tag that said--
I might be pronouncing it wrong.

04:53.564 --> 04:55.066
He/him. His pronouns.

04:55.066 --> 04:56.770
Andrew's pronouns.

04:56.770 --> 04:58.473
Oh, Andrew's in hair and makeup.

04:58.473 --> 05:00.310
Okay, well,
he responds to "Helhim," F. Y. I.,

05:00.310 --> 05:02.882
so he's sensitive
to something. God.

05:02.882 --> 05:05.020
Oh, hey, guys,
I've been meaning to tell you,

05:05.020 --> 05:06.623
y-you've been hacked.

05:06.623 --> 05:08.059
What the fuck
are you talking about, Don?

05:08.059 --> 05:10.731
The-the website on your bus,
Dave.com?

05:10.731 --> 05:12.067
It-it goes to a banking site.

05:12.067 --> 05:14.338
No. No, no, that's our
sponsor for tour.

05:14.338 --> 05:16.442
It's, like, a banking app.
You can request an advance.

05:16.442 --> 05:17.612
GATA:
Hey, I got to be
in that video, LD.

05:17.612 --> 05:19.549
I could be a young jock.

05:19.549 --> 05:21.720
Gata, you look 45.
Where's this kid? Hey.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.757
Hey. I need you to take on
a bigger role

05:23.757 --> 05:25.427
than you might have been
expecting to, okay?

05:25.427 --> 05:27.665
The key is you got to play
this sweet and sensitive,

05:27.665 --> 05:29.335
- and it's...
- Dude, put me in anything.

05:29.335 --> 05:30.771
I'm literally gonna slay
so much oxtail

05:30.771 --> 05:32.474
when this video comes out.

05:32.474 --> 05:34.345
You're drenching me.

05:34.345 --> 05:36.015
- In-in pussy.
- Right.

05:36.015 --> 05:37.752
Right. Roger.

05:37.752 --> 05:39.556
Roger, that kid will not work.
He's an actual ape.

05:39.556 --> 05:41.727
- Like, I need different options.
- Okay. Brittany's here.

05:41.727 --> 05:43.363
Which Brittany?
Which generation?

05:43.363 --> 05:44.533
Brittany Brittany.
The one the video's about.

05:44.533 --> 05:46.068
- Brittany Parker?
- Right. Yeah.

05:46.068 --> 05:47.371
ELZ:
What the fuck?
Brittany Parker's here?

05:47.371 --> 05:48.674
DON:
Oh! Invite her in.

05:48.674 --> 05:50.143
- It's been years.
- She's outside right now?

05:50.143 --> 05:51.813
Yeah. She's out there right now.

05:51.813 --> 05:53.918
How did she even find out
I was here? Oh, my God.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.621
- I didn't text her...
- Dave, how did she find out
you were here?

05:55.621 --> 05:57.357
You are sitting
on Harrison Avenue

05:57.357 --> 05:59.128
shooting a music video
with your pink tour bus

05:59.128 --> 06:00.765
- parked outside with your
big-ass face on the side.
- MIKE: Yeah.

06:00.765 --> 06:02.602
And nobody cares, uh,
about Brittany Parker.

06:02.602 --> 06:03.571
- Exactly.
- Dave, we need to make
decisions right now.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.608
We were talking before.

06:05.608 --> 06:07.444
- Are we gonna have to cut
the spin the bottle scene?
- DAVE: No...

06:07.444 --> 06:08.681
All right, then, we got to
figure out which Dave you like

06:08.681 --> 06:10.785
because I got to get him
to wardrobe.

06:10.785 --> 06:12.655
- (overlapping chatter)
- ELZ: Guys, nobody right now
should believe

06:12.655 --> 06:14.826
in this Dave, because he's
so whipped by this woman, dawg.

06:14.826 --> 06:16.697
I'm not whipped anymore.
I'm not in eighth grade, okay?

06:16.697 --> 06:18.667
There's a crowd of people
outside trying to meet me.

06:18.667 --> 06:19.970
- ELZ: Are you crying?
Are you crying?
- I'm un-whippable.

06:19.970 --> 06:21.673
So stop putting me
in that fucking...

06:21.673 --> 06:23.076
GATA:
Is this the girl
that broke his heart?

06:23.076 --> 06:24.713
Hey, is that the one
this video about, bro?

06:24.713 --> 06:26.415
- She broke your heart?
- Bro. Broke his heart?

06:26.415 --> 06:28.453
Broke him in half, dawg.
This nigga so whipped.

06:28.453 --> 06:30.023
I got to figure out
what to do with these guys.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.693
- Dave, make a decision.
- Look, at him, look at him.

06:31.693 --> 06:33.396
(laughs)

06:33.396 --> 06:34.966
His dick was green
or something, bro.

06:34.966 --> 06:36.770
- Just let him go or...?
- MIKE: No, no, don't let him go.

06:36.770 --> 06:38.106
Don't make any decisions. I need
one minute to talk to her.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.910
- MIKE: Dave, Dave...
- Shut the fuck up!

06:39.910 --> 06:42.114
- ELZ: Leave her outside, bro.
- GATA: Damn, dude.

06:44.051 --> 06:45.554
DAVE:
This is school?

06:45.554 --> 06:47.124
- Hi. Hey.
- He literally is one

06:47.124 --> 06:48.994
of my oldest friends.
This is so overdramatic.

06:48.994 --> 06:50.965
Yeah, no, she's with me.
We're good, Cliff. Thank you.

06:50.965 --> 06:52.702
- CLIFF: Hey, I'm just
doing my job, baby.
- Jesus Christ.

06:52.702 --> 06:54.572
Am I allowed to see you now,
Mr. Hollywood?

06:54.572 --> 06:56.008
Oh, yeah, I'm not being
Hollywood at all.

06:56.008 --> 06:57.477
- I had no idea that you were...
- You're not?

06:57.477 --> 06:59.048
- No, I'm not.
- This is my day off.

06:59.048 --> 07:00.751
I don't want to spend it in line
like a fucking groupie.

07:00.751 --> 07:02.689
Totally understood.
Like, my phone wasn't on me

07:02.689 --> 07:04.191
- and I'm really busy and...
- Listen, I'm just
giving you shit.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.863
- (both laugh)
- Just relax. Come here.

07:06.863 --> 07:08.701
Yeah.

07:09.603 --> 07:12.074
- Hi, Boobie.
- Hey, Boobie. How you doing?

07:12.074 --> 07:14.579
But seriously, why didn't you
tell me you were in town?

07:15.681 --> 07:17.117
Because I knew
that this music video

07:17.117 --> 07:18.988
would take up
every single minute of my time,

07:18.988 --> 07:20.925
and I just didn't want to have,
like, a false expectation.

07:20.925 --> 07:22.829
Whatever. What is
this video even about?

07:22.829 --> 07:25.200
Uh, like, a period piece.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.137
- Uh-huh.
- First and foremost. 2004.

07:27.137 --> 07:28.674
Uh, young love.
My perspective on young love.

07:28.674 --> 07:30.544
- Stop.
- What?

07:30.544 --> 07:31.913
'04?

07:31.913 --> 07:33.449
Yeah.

07:34.251 --> 07:35.721
It's about us?

07:36.890 --> 07:38.827
Yeah. But I should
probably get back inside,

07:38.827 --> 07:41.065
'cause this whole fucking
video's going haywire right now.

07:41.065 --> 07:43.169
"I should probably go back
inside 'cause the whole video's

07:43.169 --> 07:44.806
- going fucking haywire
right now."
- (laughs)

07:44.806 --> 07:47.244
If the video's about us,
where's my cameo?

07:47.244 --> 07:49.481
Well, it's, like, kids.

07:51.185 --> 07:53.691
But... yeah.

07:53.691 --> 07:55.628
Want to be in it?

07:55.628 --> 07:57.598
- Fuck yeah.
- Want to work on your off day, sweetheart?

07:57.598 --> 08:00.036
- (laughs)
- Let's go. I'll put you
in the video. That's easy.

08:00.036 --> 08:02.474

(sighs)

08:39.883 --> 08:41.920
ROGER:
Okay, back to places!

08:41.920 --> 08:43.891
- Getting ready to shoot.
- Okay!

08:43.891 --> 08:45.861
Here's where the senior
with the cool car's gonna be.

08:45.861 --> 08:48.734
Okay, I need all of this
cleared. Cut on rehearsal.

08:48.734 --> 08:50.771
Yes! Boobie, you are
a natural at this.

08:50.771 --> 08:52.207
- You're awesome.
- Wow.

08:52.207 --> 08:54.011
- You remembered everything.
- I did.

08:54.011 --> 08:56.148
God, you were, like, obsessed.

08:56.148 --> 08:57.985
Lil Dicky, I am such a huge fan.

08:57.985 --> 08:59.321
- Aww, thank you.
- Ew, stop.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.058
You know he has
a purple dick, right?

09:01.058 --> 09:02.895
- I don't have a purple dick.
- Maroon. Whatever.

09:02.895 --> 09:05.133
Hey. Can we have a video now
or do we have a video

09:05.133 --> 09:06.837
now that Uncle Dave's
in front of the camera?

09:06.837 --> 09:09.074
Am I R or W? I knew it was right
to put her in the video.

09:09.074 --> 09:10.878
Now I can be in it.
She's amazing. This is great.

09:10.878 --> 09:12.180
What's amazing
is how she bullied you

09:12.180 --> 09:13.884
into being the star
of your video.

09:13.884 --> 09:15.286
That's not at all what happened.
I'm actually just, like,

09:15.286 --> 09:16.823
placating her to get
exactly what we need.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.560
- Whatever you say.
- Where is playback here?

09:18.560 --> 09:19.896
Don't worry about it.
Keep doing what you're doing,

09:19.896 --> 09:20.965
'cause it's way better
with you in it.

09:20.965 --> 09:22.100
You guys have great chemistry.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.904
- Yeah.
- (imitates whip lashing)

09:23.904 --> 09:25.340
You know, "whipped" is, like,
a racially backed term,

09:25.340 --> 09:27.344
- so just keep that in mind.
- Sorry, Master.

09:27.344 --> 09:29.148
- Hey, show me the next shot
that you're setting up.
- Okay.

09:29.148 --> 09:30.718
Way ahead of you. Can I get
A-cam to frame up, please?

09:30.718 --> 09:32.688
So I thought it would be good
to come in

09:32.688 --> 09:34.258
on Brittany's perspective.

09:34.258 --> 09:35.961
Brittany's perspective?
Never from her perspective.

09:35.961 --> 09:37.632
- No, it's like a...
- Well, the way I see it is,

09:37.632 --> 09:38.934
- if you see it from her...
- No, no. Okay, wait.

09:38.934 --> 09:40.604
What if we came down
from my feet,

09:40.604 --> 09:43.142
and it goes up like this:
classic hero shot, okay?

09:43.142 --> 09:44.846
And then, when that guy
she starts dating--

09:44.846 --> 09:46.282
the older dude with the car--
comes, it's like,

09:46.282 --> 09:48.219
we flip it and we make it
underdog mode.

09:48.219 --> 09:50.658
- Where is, like, the guy?
- Uh, stand by.
One second, there.

09:50.658 --> 09:51.860
Uh, pulling up
in that car right now.

09:51.860 --> 09:53.262
- That's him?
- Yeah, that's him.

09:53.262 --> 09:55.100
Okay, I'm just gonna
give him a few notes.

09:55.100 --> 09:56.603
No, no, Dave, where are you
going? Where are you going?

09:56.603 --> 09:58.139
We got to keep shooting, guys!
Let's go!

09:58.139 --> 10:00.310
Hey, man.
So here's the backstory.

10:00.310 --> 10:01.980
I'm in love with this girl,

10:01.980 --> 10:03.884
you're the older guy
who starts dating her.

10:03.884 --> 10:05.621
Um...

10:05.621 --> 10:07.090
You said there was something
on the props truck

10:07.090 --> 10:08.794
that I had to look at, right?

10:08.794 --> 10:11.232
So I will be right back
and we'll th-- Yeah.

10:11.232 --> 10:12.735
Who the fuck is that guy?

10:12.735 --> 10:14.037
That's the guy
you cast to play Matt.

10:14.037 --> 10:15.674
That's the--
Brittany's older lover.

10:15.674 --> 10:17.110
I didn't cast that guy.
That's a seven-foot man.

10:17.110 --> 10:19.047
- You picked him.
- Yeah, yeah, we cast him.

10:19.047 --> 10:20.751
I didn't know he was
the Jolly Green Giant.

10:20.751 --> 10:22.722
I just-- We-- He just-- Sorry.

10:22.722 --> 10:25.059
- He's a legit seven-footer.
Like, I don't understand.
- Yeah.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.897
- His audition was chest-up.
You got to...
- It's almost at his neck.

10:26.897 --> 10:28.399
EMMA:
The eyelines are gonna be
all over the place.

10:28.399 --> 10:29.636
- It's gonna look weird as fuck.
- Yeah, no shit.

10:29.636 --> 10:31.105
Okay, okay. I tell you what.

10:31.105 --> 10:32.708
We could put him in, like,
a green screen suit.

10:32.708 --> 10:33.977
A green screen suit?
What's that gonna do?

10:33.977 --> 10:35.648
I don't need
to make him disappear

10:35.648 --> 10:37.050
- or, like, turn into
a fucking alien.
- Okay.

10:37.050 --> 10:38.754
I need a human being
to play this girl's...

10:38.754 --> 10:39.989
- We got to shoot...
- Can we upgrade an extra, maybe?

10:39.989 --> 10:41.660
- Like, I don't know.
- EMMA: Yeah.

10:41.660 --> 10:43.664
Like, that fucking piece
of shit kid with the hair?

10:43.664 --> 10:45.433
- Like, he looks kind of...
- Oh, yeah, he looks like
a piece of shit.

10:45.433 --> 10:46.903
- He's perfect.
We got to keep this going.
- Okay, hold on.

10:46.903 --> 10:47.839
Hey, Steph, Steph.
Go prep the guy

10:47.839 --> 10:49.041
with the-the hat, please.

10:49.041 --> 10:50.043
Then you can go
release our Matt.

10:50.043 --> 10:51.312
Go ahead and release Matt.

10:51.312 --> 10:52.882
No, don't release
the seven-foot guy.

10:52.882 --> 10:54.418
No, no, no.
He's, like, a funny visual.

10:54.418 --> 10:55.353
We'll have him sneeze,
or do something interesting.

10:55.353 --> 10:56.990
Bending over is funny.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.927
I thought you didn't want
the video to be funny.

10:58.927 --> 11:00.698
- Emma, it can have
moments of comedy.
- Actually, question.

11:00.698 --> 11:02.167
Should we release the
Young Daves and Brittanys now

11:02.167 --> 11:03.402
at this point,
or-or do you want to hold on...

11:03.402 --> 11:04.939
Are you serious?
Release the Young Daves?

11:04.939 --> 11:06.208
What about the Evolution of Man scene

11:06.208 --> 11:07.979
where we need
every single Young Dave?

11:07.979 --> 11:09.314
- How am I telling you this?
- Of course. Yeah, yeah.

11:09.314 --> 11:11.085
Are we getting a crane
for that scene?

11:11.085 --> 11:12.855
Okay, we couldn't fit the crane
in the parking lot.

11:12.855 --> 11:14.391
They would need a crane
to bring in the other crane,

11:14.391 --> 11:16.161
- so we just--
we couldn't afford it.
- Okay.

11:16.161 --> 11:17.999
Tell Lonny that I need playback
ready at all times.

11:17.999 --> 11:19.034
Now that I'm in the video,
I can't see what's being shot.

11:19.034 --> 11:20.470
Or you could just trust me.

11:20.470 --> 11:21.773
- Don't do that.
- STEPH: Joo! Coffee for Joo!

11:21.773 --> 11:24.278
Joo. Coffee for Joo.

11:24.278 --> 11:25.981
There you go, Joo.

11:25.981 --> 11:29.154
Sam! Coffee for Sam!

11:29.154 --> 11:31.358
- ROGER: All right,
places, everyone!
- DAVE: Thank you.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.862
ROGER:
Getting ready to shoot.

11:32.862 --> 11:34.398
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:34.398 --> 11:36.736
- So sorry.
- Why are we showing Matt
pick me up?

11:36.736 --> 11:38.774
- I thought it was about us.
- Uh, it is.

11:38.774 --> 11:40.744
Like, it's just about context
and, you know,

11:40.744 --> 11:42.380
like, really getting
the full scope of it.

11:42.380 --> 11:43.850
ROGER:
All right, everybody!

11:43.850 --> 11:44.919
Can I have background
back to one

11:44.919 --> 11:46.923
and we're gonna roll camera!

11:46.923 --> 11:48.326
Car should arrive
at "cocksucker."

11:48.326 --> 11:49.829
- The lyric "cocksucker."
- Can you do me a favor

11:49.829 --> 11:51.332
and cue the car
at "cocksucker," please?

11:51.332 --> 11:53.402
- What?
- No, it should arrive
on "cocksucker."

11:53.402 --> 11:55.206
- Uh, make sure it arrives...
- Can I have last looks
for my hair?

11:55.206 --> 11:57.344
Emma, how does my hair
look in frame right now?

11:57.344 --> 11:59.047
EMMA:
We're on your feet.

11:59.047 --> 12:00.450
Right.

12:07.264 --> 12:09.201
I just think that it's not
a wide enough shot. Like...

12:09.201 --> 12:12.407
Oh, my God, I can't stop
reading these.

12:12.407 --> 12:15.146
(gasps)
"Dear Boobie Boobois,

12:15.146 --> 12:17.417
"going to the mall
won't be the same without you,

12:17.417 --> 12:19.923
but Mr. Tobayashi
sends his best."

12:19.923 --> 12:22.427
Mr. Tobayashi.
Do you still have him?

12:22.427 --> 12:26.035
I don't know, but hang on,
I'm just, like, DM'ing Iverson.

12:26.035 --> 12:28.406
Can you look
for Mr. Tobayashi, please?

12:28.406 --> 12:31.178
- Please? (chuckles)
- Yeah. Yes, yes.

12:31.178 --> 12:33.984
Mom? Where's Tobayashi kept?

12:33.984 --> 12:36.255
- (whispers): Yes.
- Uh, ooh.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.758
Probably in the closet, I think.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.963
Oh, where are you, Tobayashi?

12:39.963 --> 12:42.334
Oh! I found him.

12:42.334 --> 12:43.870
He was eating his chips.

12:43.870 --> 12:45.908
- There he is. Tobayashi.
- There he goes.

12:45.908 --> 12:48.981
- I cannot believe
you kept all this stuff.
- Yeah.

12:48.981 --> 12:52.253
I mean, this period of time
had a profound impact on me.

12:53.890 --> 12:56.261
But we evolve, you know?

12:56.261 --> 12:59.134
Did I tell you that I was dating
Doja Cat for a little while?

12:59.134 --> 13:00.804
Which one is Doja Cat?

13:00.804 --> 13:02.374
Doja Cat, like,
she's made of milk.

13:02.374 --> 13:04.846
She's, like,
a huge global pop star.

13:04.846 --> 13:06.215
It started off
really hot and heavy.

13:06.215 --> 13:08.085
It's so hard to maintain
that level of heat.

13:08.085 --> 13:09.121
You know, like,
she's always doing her thing,

13:09.121 --> 13:10.456
I'm always doing mine.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.060
Lifestyles don't always--
one sec--

13:12.060 --> 13:13.396
like, a-allow
for that type of thing.

13:13.396 --> 13:14.866
When you're dating someone
in the industry,

13:14.866 --> 13:16.402
it's, like, not always--
What's up, Steph?

13:16.402 --> 13:18.573
Your mom is in the bathroom
and she's not coming out.

13:18.573 --> 13:20.109
What do you mean she's not
coming out? She's in this scene.

13:20.109 --> 13:21.546
She's got to come out.
Can you get her?

13:21.546 --> 13:23.049
Well, no,
I don't feel comfortable

13:23.049 --> 13:24.451
going into the bathroom,
it's her house.

13:24.451 --> 13:27.090
Okay, one sec, Boobie.
Bye, Mr. Tobayashi.

13:27.090 --> 13:29.294
What's going on?

13:29.294 --> 13:30.964
Dave, Dave, I just got off
the phone with Macaroni Grill.

13:30.964 --> 13:32.334
We got to be out of there
by 8:00 p. m.,

13:32.334 --> 13:33.537
'cause they have to open up
the kitchen.

13:33.537 --> 13:35.440
- What? They said midnight.
- I know.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.077
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- Did you tell them it was me?

13:37.077 --> 13:38.914
Yeah. They did not know
who you were, so...

13:38.914 --> 13:40.483
Okay, so you're saying I'm still
an underdog in my own city?

13:40.483 --> 13:42.320
No, that's not what I'm saying.
What I'm saying is

13:42.320 --> 13:44.124
- we need to finish this up.
- Dave, where are you going?

13:44.124 --> 13:45.594
We're underdogs.
It's cool. That's cool.

13:45.594 --> 13:46.529
- I like being an underdog.
- Where are you going?

13:46.529 --> 13:47.898
I'm getting my mom.

13:47.898 --> 13:49.502
- Hurry the fuck up.
- Okay.

13:49.502 --> 13:50.938
- Mom.
- (muffled groaning)

13:50.938 --> 13:52.340
DON:
Oh, Carol.

13:52.340 --> 13:54.478

- Oh, Carol...

13:54.478 --> 13:56.315
Carol, the-- oh...

13:56.315 --> 13:58.386
Whoa. What is going on
in here right now?

13:58.386 --> 14:00.991
Your mother ate
her hearing aids.

14:00.991 --> 14:02.394
She ate her hearing aids?

14:02.394 --> 14:03.997
Yeah. She-she took them out,

14:03.997 --> 14:05.501
she put them
on the table for some reason.

14:05.501 --> 14:07.203
To get relief
from all the noise.

14:07.203 --> 14:08.406
And-and I had some kettle corn
that I got from...

14:08.406 --> 14:10.009
That he just opened up and put

14:10.009 --> 14:10.978
- all over the table.
- ...I got it from crafty.

14:10.978 --> 14:12.615
And yeah, look.

14:12.615 --> 14:15.053
This-this is a several-thousand-
dollar problem that we got.

14:15.053 --> 14:16.556
- Mom?
- Insurance is not gonna
cover this.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.459
- Yes?

your hearing aids

14:21.900 --> 14:24.438
There's still tape
all over the walls.

14:24.438 --> 14:26.543

14:48.954 --> 14:51.125
It is insane. I agree.

14:51.125 --> 14:54.499
So, um, when are we gonna
have time to actually hang out?

14:55.299 --> 14:57.036
Uh, like, beyond
what we're doing?

14:57.036 --> 14:59.040
I don't know that I will,
just 'cause, like,

14:59.040 --> 15:01.579
we're gonna wrap late, and then
I have to go on tour tomorrow.

15:01.579 --> 15:03.583
- Mm-hmm.
- And my parents,
I need to see...

15:03.583 --> 15:05.319
It was a stupid idea, you know?

15:05.319 --> 15:07.223
It's actually
kind of insane to want

15:07.223 --> 15:10.062
- to carve out time with
one of my oldest friends.
- Okay.

15:10.062 --> 15:12.701
I'll-- Fine. I will figure out
some way after wrap

15:12.701 --> 15:15.707
- to, like, stay up all night.
- Did you just say "fine"?

15:15.707 --> 15:18.045
I don't want to be a "fine."
I don't want to be a surrender.

15:18.045 --> 15:19.982
No, no surrender at all.
I'm excited. Let's hang out.

15:19.982 --> 15:22.420
Because I'd love to chitchat
about a few things and catch up.

15:22.420 --> 15:25.026

- Me, too.

Perfect. Okay, lock it up!

16:06.509 --> 16:09.214
Get out! Okay, uh...

16:09.214 --> 16:10.483
All right, way too much cum.

Cut, cut, cut.

16:11.986 --> 16:12.988
What are you d-- Are you coming?

16:12.988 --> 16:14.424
You said pissing cum.

16:14.424 --> 16:16.529
This is way too much cum.
I'm not a fucking yak.

16:16.529 --> 16:18.332
- You said pissing cum.
- I'm trying to get, like,
a female demographic

16:18.332 --> 16:19.702
- out of this.
- That is pissing cum
right there.

16:19.702 --> 16:21.539
It's supposed to be highbrow
and poetic,

16:21.539 --> 16:23.610
like, no one's ever cum soft,
that's why we're doing it.

16:23.610 --> 16:25.547
- Not this.
- Well, you didn't tell me that.

16:25.547 --> 16:27.317
I don't know what you imagined,
but, like, how could you

16:27.317 --> 16:28.553
- have imagined this?
- Look, I mean, that's not fair.

16:28.553 --> 16:30.256
I mean, I worked on this
for a long time.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.060
It's too much. Whatever it is,
it's way too much.

16:32.060 --> 16:33.362
I got to look at playback
and see if this is even usable.

16:33.362 --> 16:35.066
CAROL:
That's all over my floor. David?

16:35.066 --> 16:36.569
DAVE:
Where's playback?
I got to watch that.

16:36.569 --> 16:38.507
CAROL:
David, don't get that
on my couch.

16:38.507 --> 16:40.042
What is the next scene?

16:40.042 --> 16:41.345
EMMA:
It looked less bad on camera

16:41.345 --> 16:42.748
than it probably felt
in the moment.

16:42.748 --> 16:44.519
I have to watch playback
because it felt horrible.

16:44.519 --> 16:46.288
- This is crazy.
- Why can't you just trust me?

16:46.288 --> 16:48.593
Emma, I obviously value
your opinion, I really do,

16:48.593 --> 16:50.329
and I'm trying
to make this our thing,

16:50.329 --> 16:52.033
but it's still a Lil Dicky video
at the end of the day,

16:52.033 --> 16:53.670
and it's got to be my thing,
it's my life story.

16:53.670 --> 16:55.641
I'm sorry. Stop guilting me
for looking at the footage.

16:55.641 --> 16:57.678
- Hey, we got to watch
the playback.
- Hey, Dave. Can we talk?

16:57.678 --> 16:59.381
- No, we have to watch
the footage.
- I'm having an issue here.

16:59.381 --> 17:01.653
- What?
- Okay, listen, um...

17:01.653 --> 17:04.357
I-I used to make
furniture, okay?

17:04.357 --> 17:05.661
Truly beautiful furniture.

17:05.661 --> 17:07.531
- Okay.
- No, it was my purpose in life,

17:07.531 --> 17:09.301
it was my joy,
I was really good at it.

17:09.301 --> 17:11.471
I-I did Pat Croce's
entire living room.

17:11.471 --> 17:13.175
What are we talking
about right now?

17:13.175 --> 17:15.046
As the business grew,
so did the pressure.

17:15.046 --> 17:18.152
To relieve that pressure,
I-I started to huff.

17:18.152 --> 17:19.822
- To hu...?
- To huff. Huff.

17:19.822 --> 17:21.291
Huff. Huff.
(inhales sharply)

17:21.291 --> 17:23.295
- Oh!
- Yeah. Shellac, lacquer.

17:23.295 --> 17:24.431
I got a-- I got addicted.

17:24.431 --> 17:26.168
- Oh. Oh, God.
- Okay? I'd huff,

17:26.168 --> 17:28.405
- create, huff some more,
you know?
- Yeah.

17:28.405 --> 17:29.809
I smoke weed when I rap.
I-- You know.

17:29.809 --> 17:31.679
Yeah, of all--
Did you lose your family? I did.

17:31.679 --> 17:33.215
That-- No, sorry.

17:33.215 --> 17:34.619
- No apologies from you, please.
- Okay.

17:34.619 --> 17:37.390
Okay? I lost my family,
I lost the store.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.363
And-and, look, these floors,
they've recently been redone.

17:40.363 --> 17:42.568
- Fumigation? Yeah.
- It's-it's getting bad.

17:42.568 --> 17:44.572
So if I stay here, all right,
by the end of the night,

17:44.572 --> 17:47.277
I'm in a dumpster behind a frame
store, digging to get that...

17:47.277 --> 17:48.580
You can sleep over.
Like, I mean,

17:48.580 --> 17:50.082
it's probably bad
to sleep over, but, like,

17:50.082 --> 17:51.485
you don't have to go to
the frame store.

17:51.485 --> 17:53.122
- I'll pin you to the bed.
- I-I think you're great.

17:53.122 --> 17:54.692
- I'm sorry, I got to go.
- No, because if you go,

17:54.692 --> 17:56.596
I won't be able to watch
the footage, and I have no idea

17:56.596 --> 17:58.165
- what's going on in the video.
- I got to take care of myself.

17:58.165 --> 17:59.434
No, please don't go, Lonny.
Please don't go.

17:59.434 --> 18:00.604

18:00.604 --> 18:02.373

Brittany, where are you...?

20:24.959 --> 20:26.662
- Cut! Where is she going?
- Dave, don't call cut.

20:26.662 --> 20:28.533
- We're leaving in two minutes.
- Okay.

20:28.533 --> 20:30.537
- Oh, no, no.
- Let me reset
while we get her, please.

20:30.537 --> 20:32.440
- No, wait, we got
to shoot now, man!
- EMMA: We can't go again!

20:32.440 --> 20:34.845
...hung up on this girl, man.
We have no video now, Dave.

20:34.845 --> 20:37.250
Yeah, we got 90 seconds
or they pull that plug.

20:37.250 --> 20:38.953
- Literally.
- Okay, well, then
bring everyone outside

20:38.953 --> 20:40.423
for the Evolution of Man scene.

20:40.423 --> 20:41.692
- We'll do it out there.
- No, Dave,

20:41.692 --> 20:43.262
we don't have permits
to shoot outside.

20:43.262 --> 20:44.965
Roger, this is Philly.

20:44.965 --> 20:47.303
Nobody gives a fuck
about permits.

20:49.040 --> 20:52.648
Okay, everybody,
we're moving outside!

20:53.917 --> 20:55.587
DAVE:
Boobie!

20:55.587 --> 20:57.490
We're almost finished.
Please don't go right now.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.294
That's the end
of your fucking video?

20:59.294 --> 21:00.964
I-I'm not gonna let you
make me into a villain, Dave.

21:00.964 --> 21:03.736
Are you actually surprised
by the contents of this video?

21:03.736 --> 21:05.841
Like, I'm just showing
what happened that night.

21:05.841 --> 21:07.744
Cool, you're just gonna do

21:07.744 --> 21:09.615
the exact same thing
you always do to me. Great.

21:09.615 --> 21:11.686
I should've known that this
was where it was gonna go.

21:12.621 --> 21:14.859
What are you talking about?

21:14.859 --> 21:17.898
You're used to owning me
and controlling me

21:17.898 --> 21:20.336
and manipulating me
and having me do your bidding,

21:20.336 --> 21:22.306
- and it's just not
that way anymore.
- I'm manipulative?

21:22.306 --> 21:24.645
- Yeah.
- Uh, I came here today
to hang out with my friend,

21:24.645 --> 21:26.649
and all of a sudden,
I'm in a video

21:26.649 --> 21:28.620
- where you're making me
look like an asshole.
- If you feel

21:28.620 --> 21:30.624
like an asshole by watching
what went down in there,

21:30.624 --> 21:32.026
again, I don't know
what to tell you.

21:32.026 --> 21:33.630
That's just, like,
what occurred.

21:33.630 --> 21:34.999
You know what I think?

21:34.999 --> 21:36.502
What you're actually feeling
is the fact

21:36.502 --> 21:39.307
that I've moved on from you.

21:40.777 --> 21:42.480
Boobie?

21:42.480 --> 21:46.021
We just spent a whole day
shooting a video about me.

21:46.021 --> 21:47.624
It's closure. It's closure.

21:47.624 --> 21:49.495
You're clearly not over it.

21:49.495 --> 21:52.466
And you left out the biggest
fucking detail.

21:52.466 --> 21:54.070
What?

21:54.070 --> 21:56.041
That we dated for a month
after that.

21:56.041 --> 21:59.414
One month, Brittany.
You gave me one month.

21:59.414 --> 22:01.886
Five years of being
your absolute best friend,

22:01.886 --> 22:02.921
and then what happened?

22:02.921 --> 22:04.925
You broke my heart so quickly

22:04.925 --> 22:06.929
for another piece of shit
older guy.

22:06.929 --> 22:08.766
So forgive me for not including
that second ending

22:08.766 --> 22:10.670
in this video, okay?

22:10.670 --> 22:12.039
It fucking killed me.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.510
And it really is probably
exactly why

22:13.510 --> 22:15.412
I am today the way
that I am today.

22:15.412 --> 22:16.949
This fucking relationship.

22:16.949 --> 22:18.953
(laughs):
Okay, well, yeah.

22:18.953 --> 22:21.057
Uh, it's life, Dave.
I don't know what to tell you.

22:21.057 --> 22:24.063
I was 16 years old.
It was depressing for me, too.

22:24.063 --> 22:26.067
I had family problems.

22:26.067 --> 22:29.374
I was fucking cutting myself.

22:32.714 --> 22:34.518
That sucks.

22:34.518 --> 22:36.889
I obviously did not know that.

22:38.125 --> 22:39.828
I'm just trying
to tell my story.

22:39.828 --> 22:42.033
Great, tell your story.
That's fine.

22:42.033 --> 22:43.937
But I'm not gonna tell it
because it's not mine.

22:43.937 --> 22:46.709
And I'm not gonna be
a prop in your...

22:46.709 --> 22:49.782
"female demographic video."

22:49.782 --> 22:51.519
Where are you going?

22:51.519 --> 22:54.725
(sighs)
That's my boyfriend, Dave.

22:54.725 --> 22:57.129
We've been dating
for three months.

22:57.129 --> 22:58.967
But how would you
know that, right?

22:58.967 --> 23:02.674
'Cause it's not as interesting
as dating Doja Cat.

23:02.674 --> 23:06.081
Does he have a pink, thick dick?

23:07.784 --> 23:10.824
I really loved you.

23:10.824 --> 23:12.928
It doesn't seem
to matter to you at all.

23:16.636 --> 23:19.541
It... Of...
It always will matter.

23:24.518 --> 23:26.488
ROGER:
Dave. Dave.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.425
There is no time.

23:28.425 --> 23:30.597
- Yeah.
- We're done.

23:30.597 --> 23:32.567
I mean, maybe one setup. I...

23:32.567 --> 23:34.672
Tell me what you want to do.

23:36.642 --> 23:38.780
Do we have any Brittanys
still here?

23:38.780 --> 23:41.652
Yes, actually. One. Uh,
wardrobe lady's daughter, so...

23:41.652 --> 23:43.188
- Which generation is that?
- I don't know.

23:43.188 --> 23:44.758
Doesn't even matter.
Get her camera-ready.

23:44.758 --> 23:46.161
I just need, like, five minutes

23:46.161 --> 23:47.998
to sit and think about
the ending of this video.

23:47.998 --> 23:49.602
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I have an evolution...

23:49.602 --> 23:52.608
Copy that. Okay. Uh, hey,
uh, Steph. Um...

23:52.608 --> 23:55.647
I have an idea to get it
pretty fast in, like, one take.

23:55.647 --> 23:57.851
Do you want to see it?

23:57.851 --> 24:01.626
Uh, do what you see.
I really do trust you.

24:01.626 --> 24:03.028
Oh.

24:03.028 --> 24:05.065
Okay. Let's go.

24:05.065 --> 24:06.669
- Uh, Roger?
- ROGER: Yes?

24:06.669 --> 24:08.171
EMMA: Okay.
