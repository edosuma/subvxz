WEBVTT

01:34.855 --> 01:35.855
Calm.

01:35.879 --> 01:36.879
It's all right.

01:37.082 --> 01:38.082
It's all right.

01:38.981 --> 01:39.981
I am here.

01:40.168 --> 01:41.302
I'm here now.

01:42.527 --> 01:43.621
It's just a dream.

01:44.879 --> 01:45.879
Just a dream.

02:21.015 --> 02:23.131
They say that tomorrow
will be a beautiful day.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.312
AND...

02:26.336 --> 02:28.085
You have a meeting
this afternoon.

02:28.195 --> 02:29.195
Do not forget.

02:29.219 --> 02:30.219
I know.

02:34.735 --> 02:36.055
Joan and I are
staying no shelter.

02:36.079 --> 02:37.747
See you later to help.

02:38.752 --> 02:40.236
Well, call me when it's over.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.526
And I'll get you.

02:42.381 --> 02:44.302
You do not have to
wait awake, Mom.

02:45.099 --> 02:46.699
Joan has been walking with me.

02:48.373 --> 02:49.373
Honey...

02:49.738 --> 02:51.005
We've talked about it.

02:52.027 --> 02:54.019
And I'm sure that
We'll talk again.

02:55.762 --> 02:57.035
Just... please...

02:57.768 --> 02:59.368
This time trust me.

03:00.291 --> 03:02.024
I swear I'll be fine.

03:04.205 --> 03:05.470
Do not worry.

03:09.825 --> 03:11.158
Do not wait up.

03:11.371 --> 03:12.371
Love you mom.

03:17.351 --> 03:18.351
I'm a whore.

03:19.257 --> 03:20.724
I'm drunk. Again.

03:23.575 --> 03:25.926
And he just needed
something to hit.

03:32.425 --> 03:33.949
I still hear the sound of my jaw

03:33.973 --> 03:35.814
breaking before I
fall to the ground.

03:37.715 --> 03:39.581
I can not get it out of my head.

03:39.969 --> 03:40.969
As a...

03:41.344 --> 03:42.890
something damp breaking.

03:44.570 --> 03:45.570
This time...

03:46.633 --> 03:48.566
I thought he was
going to kill me.

03:52.864 --> 03:53.864
I'm sorry.

03:54.213 --> 03:56.613
No need to apologize here, Mary.

03:56.877 --> 03:57.978
Not to us.

04:00.116 --> 04:01.850
Thank you for sharing.

04:03.030 --> 04:04.319
Thank you, Mary.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.546
Right.

04:06.570 --> 04:07.374
Who would like to talk...

04:07.382 --> 04:09.264
He would not let me
go to the hospital.

04:09.984 --> 04:11.650
Said I'd be fine.

04:13.100 --> 04:14.100
And I...

04:14.124 --> 04:15.616
I tried to forgive him.

04:16.124 --> 04:17.248
I know I should.

04:17.272 --> 04:18.935
And that it would do me good.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.959
All in the time of
the Lord, Mary.

04:21.077 --> 04:22.077
In His time.

04:24.077 --> 04:25.077
Mary,

04:25.842 --> 04:26.959
Time will not help.

04:27.139 --> 04:27.935
Joan, please.

04:27.959 --> 04:29.359
Want to know the truth?

04:31.256 --> 04:33.256
Want to know what
to do for improve?

04:34.856 --> 04:35.856
Payback.

04:35.880 --> 04:36.880
Joan!

04:37.006 --> 04:39.553
Sorry, just give permission.
For an idiot

04:39.577 --> 04:41.110
continue being an idiot.

04:41.295 --> 04:42.295
Mary, God...

04:42.303 --> 04:44.701
God is fucking her.

04:46.710 --> 04:48.155
Where He was when
the her husband

04:48.179 --> 04:49.512
broke your jaw.

04:53.257 --> 04:54.457
Where he was...

04:54.749 --> 04:56.600
when my father beat me?

04:57.160 --> 04:58.200
Maybe we should listen...

04:58.216 --> 05:00.247
Do you want to know what to do?
To improve?

05:02.419 --> 05:03.753
Do not wait for God.

05:05.234 --> 05:06.701
Break his jaw.

05:07.578 --> 05:08.952
Break his legs.

05:10.039 --> 05:11.372
Do what you need,

05:11.765 --> 05:13.343
for him to pay for what he did.

05:14.562 --> 05:15.562
Joan!

05:16.459 --> 05:18.526
Maybe you should leave.

05:19.865 --> 05:20.865
Right.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.522
I'll see you up there.

05:28.860 --> 05:30.127
Sorry about that.

05:30.969 --> 05:33.172
Francis, would you like to talk?

05:34.625 --> 05:36.825
I could have taken it
lightly with Mary.

05:38.454 --> 05:39.852
The world is hard, G.

05:40.860 --> 05:42.476
She's been through too much.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.465
You do not need any more lies.

05:44.888 --> 05:45.888
I know.

05:46.372 --> 05:47.731
I just feel sorry for her.

05:51.223 --> 05:53.581
I'm not going back
to the group anyway.

05:53.948 --> 05:54.948
Oh really?

05:55.128 --> 05:56.128
Yes.

05:57.620 --> 05:59.948
I think I got it all What
I wanted from there.

06:01.582 --> 06:02.582
You.

06:06.106 --> 06:07.887
Oh, forgive me!

06:08.035 --> 06:10.957
I just wanted to let you
know that you're free.

06:13.031 --> 06:14.498
Are you alright? - Hey!

06:15.992 --> 06:16.992
She is fine.

06:18.489 --> 06:19.489
Excuse.

06:24.649 --> 06:26.249
Need a little help?

06:27.862 --> 06:29.729
Just tell me it will get better.

06:31.887 --> 06:32.887
Good...

06:33.876 --> 06:35.382
or will not.

06:36.845 --> 06:39.921
At least we're not
eating that shit.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.747
Sometimes I really...

06:48.617 --> 06:49.617
Screwed up.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.286
You know?

06:53.676 --> 06:55.143
To return to normal.

06:57.965 --> 07:01.051
I feel stupid for not
have scars to show.

07:02.254 --> 07:03.254
Scars?

07:04.355 --> 07:05.555
They are nothing.

07:06.931 --> 07:09.011
We both go through our shit.

07:11.630 --> 07:13.036
That's what brought us together.

07:15.893 --> 07:17.227
I also thought about that.

07:18.579 --> 07:20.313
How... If we had not

07:20.337 --> 07:21.954
past all this.

07:22.602 --> 07:24.602
We would never have
found each other.

07:27.476 --> 07:28.743
Would you change that?

07:30.059 --> 07:31.059
What?

07:34.044 --> 07:35.778
The night they took you.

07:36.216 --> 07:38.016
If I could go back to

07:38.560 --> 07:39.560
5 years ago.

07:40.592 --> 07:42.458
Had he gone the other way?

07:45.040 --> 07:47.440
And have not gone
through that night?

07:49.539 --> 07:50.539
No nightmares.

07:52.579 --> 07:53.845
No support group.

07:56.844 --> 07:57.844
Without me.

08:01.823 --> 08:03.686
I think if I could choose...

08:06.072 --> 08:07.938
I'd pass by another street...

08:09.940 --> 08:13.406
But I still think you I
would find it anyway.

08:15.325 --> 08:17.125
What if he knew he would not?

08:23.294 --> 08:24.294
As well?

08:27.560 --> 08:29.484
I would take every
whiplash from my father

08:29.508 --> 08:31.879
if I knew I'd meet
you at the end.

08:37.692 --> 08:40.356
But maybe I just like
it of being punished.

08:45.068 --> 08:46.201
You're a jerk.

08:47.577 --> 08:48.577
I know.

08:57.973 --> 08:59.773
I found you in this life.

09:01.061 --> 09:02.061
This way.

09:04.017 --> 09:06.351
And I'll be eternally
grateful for that.

09:08.112 --> 09:10.112
I do not know where I
would be without you.

09:12.783 --> 09:15.518
I just know I would not be here.

09:17.472 --> 09:18.472
Now.

09:25.902 --> 09:26.902
Oh shit.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.733
I bought you something.

09:38.133 --> 09:39.318
Reminded me of you.

09:43.037 --> 09:44.451
It's to protect you.

09:47.521 --> 09:48.788
I feel safe.

09:49.826 --> 09:52.559
And it's not your
gift of birthday.

09:53.786 --> 09:55.319
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

09:56.706 --> 09:57.706
You will love.

09:59.439 --> 10:01.236
I can not believe
it's been a year.

10:01.260 --> 10:02.260
Me neither.

10:03.346 --> 10:05.279
I thought it would never come.

10:27.163 --> 10:28.483
You should go.

10:29.343 --> 10:30.343
I do not want.

10:31.084 --> 10:32.084
Me neither.

10:33.728 --> 10:35.049
Your mother scares me.

10:38.497 --> 10:39.697
Happy Birthday.

10:40.427 --> 10:41.427
Do not.

10:42.427 --> 10:43.427
Not yet.

10:46.638 --> 10:47.771
See you tomorrow.

10:47.941 --> 10:49.129
Okay. See you tomorrow.

13:48.084 --> 13:50.417
Hey! You called Ruth and Gloria.

13:50.669 --> 13:52.741
Please leave your message.

13:56.077 --> 13:57.655
Mother! Mother!

13:58.069 --> 13:59.069
Mother! Mother! Mother!

14:39.380 --> 14:40.380
Joan?

14:40.404 --> 14:41.972
Glad you could make it today.

14:42.628 --> 14:43.628
Hi, Kent.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.230
Have you seen Gloria?

14:45.918 --> 14:47.065
No not yet.

14:48.128 --> 14:49.730
She's kind of late.

14:50.487 --> 14:51.487
It's all right?

14:52.088 --> 14:53.088
Yes.

14:54.634 --> 14:55.893
I'll help, okay?

18:33.648 --> 18:35.312
Please do not hurt me.

18:39.711 --> 18:40.711
You should drink.

18:54.774 --> 18:57.374
It will not feel good
after the ritual.

19:03.382 --> 19:04.982
I know you're one of them.

19:07.575 --> 19:08.575
Tomorrow.

19:10.421 --> 19:12.021
After the sun rises.

19:14.450 --> 19:16.294
They will not need you any more.

19:20.715 --> 19:22.782
Soon we will all know the truth.

19:25.723 --> 19:28.523
And I promise you'll see
the sunrise tomorrow.

20:04.443 --> 20:06.709
Why are you doing this to me?

20:06.936 --> 20:07.936
Because?

20:08.936 --> 20:09.936
Because...

20:12.837 --> 20:14.370
You need to be saved.

20:37.295 --> 20:38.295
Hello?

20:38.709 --> 20:40.833
Hi, Ruth. It's Joan.

20:41.451 --> 20:42.451
From the shelter.

20:42.714 --> 20:44.003
Of course, Joan. Hi.

20:44.902 --> 20:45.902
It's all right?

20:46.470 --> 20:47.470
Ah. Yes Yes.

20:48.048 --> 20:50.462
I'm at the shelter.
Looking for Glory.

20:50.486 --> 20:51.986
She is at home? - No.

20:53.103 --> 20:54.503
She should be there.

20:54.886 --> 20:55.417
I know.

20:55.589 --> 20:58.010
Only nobody has seen her yet.
Today.

20:58.705 --> 21:00.238
Can you take a look there?

21:00.481 --> 21:02.547
If he's still sleeping, maybe?

21:05.005 --> 21:06.005
Hello?

21:07.292 --> 21:08.292
Ruth?

21:17.195 --> 21:18.195
Hello?

21:18.477 --> 21:20.476
Ruth? Are you there?

21:22.125 --> 21:23.925
You have a new message.

21:25.660 --> 21:27.169
Mother! Mother!

21:27.639 --> 21:28.639
For! For!

21:41.410 --> 21:43.120
She hardly ever leaves.

21:44.128 --> 21:45.328
She would have come back.

21:45.618 --> 21:47.336
Did she say anything else?

21:47.837 --> 21:50.297
Anything to know Where
could she have gone?

21:50.439 --> 21:52.572
She said. You just heard.

21:53.209 --> 21:55.409
I know it's hard
for both of you.

21:57.115 --> 21:59.372
But unfortunately, we do not
know what that message says.

21:59.396 --> 22:01.646
You know! Just do
not want to hear.

22:02.715 --> 22:05.449
Look, I already checked the
information in the system.

22:06.286 --> 22:07.520
We'll keep an eye out.

22:09.020 --> 22:11.887
Something happened to her.
You're the police!

22:12.876 --> 22:14.420
You should find her!

22:14.444 --> 22:16.644
Let's search. Scan the area.

22:17.092 --> 22:18.888
Maybe someone has
seen something.

22:19.553 --> 22:21.020
Maybe we're lucky.

22:22.781 --> 22:24.381
I'll find her alone.

22:31.072 --> 22:34.087
And the last time someone saw her
It was 2 in the morning today.

22:34.277 --> 22:37.277
I gave Kent a map of the
neighborhood of Gloria.

22:37.300 --> 22:38.659
Knock on doors.

22:38.839 --> 22:40.039
Search the streets.

22:40.472 --> 22:41.730
Hand over the leaflets.

22:42.557 --> 22:44.166
Someone has to know something.

22:44.674 --> 22:46.207
Let's find Gloria.

22:53.645 --> 22:55.712
Why did you come back for me?

22:58.348 --> 23:00.015
Among all the people...

23:00.786 --> 23:02.253
Why did they choose me?

23:05.675 --> 23:06.675
Huh?

23:09.057 --> 23:10.057
Because?

23:14.110 --> 23:16.377
You ended up with my life!

23:16.595 --> 23:17.595
Your life?

23:19.179 --> 23:20.784
They made you hostage
for one day.

23:21.784 --> 23:23.784
I have my whole life with me.

23:23.909 --> 23:24.659
All life.

23:24.870 --> 23:26.603
You took everything from me!

23:27.830 --> 23:30.056
At least you had something
to be taken away.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.164
The first time I saw you.

23:44.782 --> 23:46.539
You were dressed.

23:48.619 --> 23:49.798
Printed with flowers.

23:52.002 --> 23:54.602
I remember thinking
that you was an angel.

24:00.729 --> 24:01.862
The first night.

24:03.034 --> 24:04.500
The night of the sacrifice.

24:05.010 --> 24:07.277
It was to be my last on Earth.

24:10.207 --> 24:11.474
You looked at me.

24:13.683 --> 24:14.683
I knew that...

24:17.878 --> 24:20.278
All my doubts were real.

24:21.502 --> 24:24.835
How could they do something like this?
With something so beautiful?

24:28.379 --> 24:30.199
Everything I thought I knew.

24:31.614 --> 24:32.614
My faith.

24:34.184 --> 24:35.184
My family.

24:36.559 --> 24:37.892
Nothing was real.

24:40.986 --> 24:42.586
I was born into a lie.

24:47.731 --> 24:50.064
While the others
sacrificed themselves.

24:52.485 --> 24:53.611
I pretended.

24:56.180 --> 24:57.736
I was not willing to die

24:57.759 --> 24:59.626
for something he
did not believe.

25:04.045 --> 25:05.045
Then I ran away.

25:07.795 --> 25:09.279
I did not look back.

25:09.772 --> 25:11.438
So why am I here?

25:13.150 --> 25:15.009
Because I need to
finish what I started.

25:15.127 --> 25:16.127
It is what it is?

25:20.244 --> 25:21.361
Save your life.

25:32.366 --> 25:33.366
Hello?

25:33.390 --> 25:36.257
Joan, it's Ruth.
Glad you got it.

25:36.488 --> 25:37.488
Hi, Ruth.

25:37.527 --> 25:39.253
The police are here all morning.

25:39.379 --> 25:41.112
They were looking
around the house.

25:41.722 --> 25:43.722
They found something out there.

25:44.090 --> 25:45.090
What did you think?

25:45.308 --> 25:46.442
They found a necklace.

25:46.965 --> 25:48.984
It's a chain with a pendant.

25:49.008 --> 25:50.398
With a pendant...

25:52.305 --> 25:53.305
Joan?

25:53.781 --> 25:55.531
Yeah, I gave it to
her last night.

25:56.727 --> 25:57.727
Where were you?

25:57.751 --> 25:58.751
Down in the street.

25:59.243 --> 26:00.774
Right in front of the house.

26:01.997 --> 26:03.298
In front of your house?

26:03.408 --> 26:04.722
Yes. On the sidewalk.

26:05.332 --> 26:07.222
Sorry, Joan. I need to hang up.

26:07.332 --> 26:10.199
Okay. Keep me updated.
- Leave it to me.

27:01.461 --> 27:02.661
What is it, Thomas?

27:05.367 --> 27:06.967
The cat ate your tongue?

27:26.026 --> 27:27.510
Open your mouth. Breathe!

27:37.268 --> 27:39.025
It's so hot.

27:49.450 --> 27:51.450
What's happening to me?

28:17.042 --> 28:18.042
Hi.

28:18.995 --> 28:20.979
I'm not interested. - Wait.

28:21.511 --> 28:23.369
I'm just looking for my friend.

28:23.557 --> 28:24.808
She disappeared last night.

28:24.832 --> 28:26.792
And I'm asking around. If
they have seen anything.

28:26.816 --> 28:28.314
Sorry, lass. I can not help you.

28:28.526 --> 28:29.526
Wait.

28:48.323 --> 28:49.323
Listen here!

28:51.276 --> 28:52.276
Shut up!

29:01.221 --> 29:02.221
Take a look.

29:05.526 --> 29:06.592
Did you see my friend?

29:07.269 --> 29:08.269
Do not.

29:09.129 --> 29:10.129
Do not.

29:15.841 --> 29:16.841
Thanks.

29:17.841 --> 29:19.174
It was not so hard.

29:21.044 --> 29:22.711
Let me know if you're coming.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.397
Sorry for disturbing.

29:28.106 --> 29:29.465
Have a good night.

30:31.240 --> 30:32.849
No, no!

30:42.343 --> 30:44.076
You need to be quiet.

30:49.539 --> 30:50.539
Quiet.

30:52.565 --> 30:54.298
You need to be quiet.

30:56.018 --> 30:57.085
They were here.

30:58.878 --> 30:59.944
They were here.

31:01.113 --> 31:02.713
They were here I saw.

31:07.957 --> 31:09.581
You're burning with a fever.

31:11.676 --> 31:12.676
Please.

31:13.665 --> 31:15.865
Do what you want to
do with me soon.

31:17.657 --> 31:18.720
I'm doing.

31:22.209 --> 31:23.209
You will see.

31:24.217 --> 31:26.724
When the sun rises
this will end.

31:31.541 --> 31:32.838
Who did this to you?

31:40.513 --> 31:42.046
I've never been like them.

31:44.341 --> 31:46.674
They kept telling
me what to believe.

31:49.947 --> 31:51.080
I could not.

31:56.904 --> 31:58.970
They deserved what happened.

32:00.520 --> 32:02.520
What they did to themselves.

32:04.599 --> 32:06.199
You mean that night?

32:07.975 --> 32:09.509
The night they took me?

32:22.599 --> 32:23.865
It will be dark soon.

32:35.864 --> 32:37.575
Okay, I'll ask if they saw her.

32:37.880 --> 32:38.880
Just a second.

32:39.677 --> 32:41.477
Hello? - Hi, Joan. It's Ruth.

32:41.771 --> 32:42.958
Hi, Ruth. - Hi.

32:43.182 --> 32:44.182
All right?

32:44.206 --> 32:46.057
- Need to talk to you.
Can you come here now?

32:46.081 --> 32:47.281
Ok I'm going.

33:06.226 --> 33:07.292
Good evening, Joan.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.030
Did you hide it?

33:10.795 --> 33:12.600
She is? - No.

33:13.850 --> 33:15.117
Let's find Gloria.

33:15.967 --> 33:18.404
But I need to make you more.
Some questions.

33:20.989 --> 33:21.989
Okay.

33:24.653 --> 33:25.653
Have you seen this?

33:27.278 --> 33:28.345
Yes. I did it.

33:30.053 --> 33:31.701
It is?

33:35.887 --> 33:37.222
As I said.

33:37.473 --> 33:39.806
I gave it to Gloria last night.

33:41.332 --> 33:42.332
Is this relevant?

33:42.352 --> 33:46.219
We received a call that a
woman threatened a guy.

33:48.055 --> 33:49.122
This is horrible.

33:49.555 --> 33:53.022
Apparently she was upset by the
disappearance of the friend.

33:54.884 --> 33:56.818
Well, there are a lot
of us out there.

33:57.947 --> 34:00.790
I know we can find... "The victim
said she was a young woman."

34:01.072 --> 34:02.072
About 20 years.

34:02.476 --> 34:03.491
Redhead.

34:03.515 --> 34:04.515
Black sweatshirt.

34:04.687 --> 34:06.421
What happened last night?

34:08.625 --> 34:10.655
No, no. This is a mistake.

34:11.070 --> 34:13.139
You should accompany her.
Even at home.

34:13.164 --> 34:14.234
What happened?

34:14.257 --> 34:16.514
Ruth. I swear I do not know!

34:16.632 --> 34:17.632
Anyway...

34:17.766 --> 34:19.126
You'll have to come
with me, Joan.

34:19.150 --> 34:20.524
No! Fuck you.

34:20.945 --> 34:22.842
Gloria is still lost!
Are you kidding me?

34:22.867 --> 34:23.913
She needs help!

34:23.922 --> 34:25.402
Joan. You need to calm down.

34:25.409 --> 34:27.308
Why are you trying to stop me?

34:27.324 --> 34:28.433
I'm not.

34:28.902 --> 34:30.918
You just need to come with me.
Some questions.

34:30.934 --> 34:31.934
No!

34:31.949 --> 34:33.597
It can be the easy way...

34:33.621 --> 34:34.955
Or the hard way.

35:02.726 --> 35:03.726
Where is she?

35:03.788 --> 35:04.788
What did you do?

35:04.804 --> 35:07.335
He does not want people together!
You're hiding it from me!

35:07.351 --> 35:08.685
What you mean?

35:08.709 --> 35:10.534
You are lying! - No!

36:02.253 --> 36:03.253
What's your name?

36:11.660 --> 36:12.870
My name is Thomas.

36:14.761 --> 36:15.761
Glory.

36:18.847 --> 36:19.847
IT IS.

36:23.046 --> 36:24.046
Thomas.

36:25.764 --> 36:28.467
Please tell me what happened.
That night.

36:32.101 --> 36:33.179
Do you know...

36:36.750 --> 36:37.750
That night...

36:39.306 --> 36:41.056
5 years ago was the last time

36:41.064 --> 36:43.197
that the Moon of the
Locusts appeared.

36:45.353 --> 36:46.970
We were warned by its light.

36:48.609 --> 36:50.209
The Lord would be received.

36:52.409 --> 36:54.343
And until the light
of the next moon...

36:57.183 --> 36:58.339
He would be reborn.

36:59.948 --> 37:00.948
This world.

37:06.486 --> 37:07.486
Tonight.

37:08.377 --> 37:10.330
Okay. And on the west side?

37:11.221 --> 37:14.314
Gary and Marshal said they had
a friend there who would help.

37:15.080 --> 37:16.747
Tell them to ask again.

37:18.222 --> 37:20.362
Do not know! Jesus, Kent!

37:20.722 --> 37:24.190
Bars were open, someone
should have seen something!

37:24.206 --> 37:26.073
And we need to find out who!

37:26.202 --> 37:27.389
<i>The staff is tired, Joan.</i>

37:27.413 --> 37:30.693
I do not care! Keep looking!

37:51.875 --> 37:53.608
And what are we waiting for?

37:59.169 --> 38:02.153
They believed that their
Lord is within you.

38:03.310 --> 38:06.411
That in the last 5
years He has grown.

38:07.816 --> 38:09.083
Getting stronger.

38:11.791 --> 38:12.791
Tonight.

38:14.784 --> 38:16.517
They would finish the ritual.

38:19.870 --> 38:23.470
You would be sacrificed to
bring it to this world.

38:24.812 --> 38:27.217
But I will not let
that happen to you.

38:30.224 --> 38:31.224
It's tomorrow.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.300
After sunrise.

38:34.060 --> 38:36.793
They will have failed
to finish the ritual.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.618
They will not need you any more.

38:44.337 --> 38:45.403
You will be free.

38:49.712 --> 38:50.778
And who are they?

38:53.153 --> 38:54.887
The people who took me.

38:57.325 --> 38:59.525
Besides you. They're all dead.

39:02.150 --> 39:03.150
Do not.

39:05.174 --> 39:06.174
Not everyone.

39:14.622 --> 39:15.756
Forgive me Lord.

39:17.208 --> 39:18.575
Your servant calls you.

39:21.851 --> 39:23.186
I failed you.

39:25.148 --> 39:26.548
I failed all of us.

39:30.239 --> 39:33.039
The time of his
rebirth is ending.

39:33.903 --> 39:34.903
I beg you.

39:37.356 --> 39:38.918
Help me find your hostess.

39:38.942 --> 39:41.190
So that I can bring
you into this world.

39:42.933 --> 39:45.333
May I bathe my sins in blood.

39:45.831 --> 39:47.543
And let the blood be cleansed.

39:49.052 --> 39:51.465
May I bathe my sins in blood.

39:51.489 --> 39:53.963
And let the blood be cleansed.

40:30.399 --> 40:31.799
What have they done to me?

40:32.868 --> 40:36.141
They believed that if they found
a hostess for her spirit.

40:36.165 --> 40:37.165
In this life.

40:38.019 --> 40:40.419
They would have eternity
in the next life.

40:41.479 --> 40:42.946
You are her hostess.

40:43.284 --> 40:44.284
Who is he?

40:44.683 --> 40:45.854
Their Lord.

40:48.683 --> 40:49.683
Abaddon.

40:55.064 --> 40:56.696
The Books of Revelations,

40:56.720 --> 40:58.853
He called him the
Angel of Destruction.

41:00.017 --> 41:01.283
Guardian of the Abyss.

41:02.217 --> 41:03.591
The Thief of Souls.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.459
Why are you trying to save me?

41:08.311 --> 41:09.644
Long ago...

41:10.873 --> 41:11.873
you saved me.

42:02.675 --> 42:03.675
Thomas.

42:06.855 --> 42:08.255
What have they done to me?

42:08.941 --> 42:09.941
Anything.

42:11.676 --> 42:13.010
You're just sick.

42:13.654 --> 42:15.521
It is a reaction to chloroform.

42:16.803 --> 42:17.803
My back.

42:19.318 --> 42:20.318
They are hurting.

42:37.326 --> 42:38.326
What's it?

42:39.092 --> 42:40.092
Anything.

42:41.228 --> 42:42.228
What?

42:43.892 --> 42:44.892
I'll be right back.

42:47.282 --> 42:48.282
I'll be right back.

43:32.084 --> 43:33.084
It hurts.

43:35.131 --> 43:37.665
Thomas. What's happening to me?

43:38.444 --> 43:39.444
Please.

43:42.335 --> 43:45.162
You're just sick. You
need to lie down.

43:45.436 --> 43:46.436
Thomas.

43:47.248 --> 43:48.648
I'm so afraid.

43:56.273 --> 43:58.939
I will not let anything
happen with you.

44:29.591 --> 44:30.746
You love Me?

44:35.428 --> 44:36.428
You love Me.

44:37.194 --> 44:38.194
It is not?

44:41.225 --> 44:42.537
I just want to help you.

44:42.561 --> 44:43.889
I know.

44:44.652 --> 44:45.823
Sweet Thomas.

44:47.824 --> 44:48.870
My angel.

45:02.493 --> 45:03.493
Thomas.

45:04.001 --> 45:05.001
Glory...

45:05.415 --> 45:06.749
Gloria, we can not.

45:08.009 --> 45:10.024
I just want to feel safe.

45:10.408 --> 45:11.541
No, we can not.

45:12.025 --> 45:13.025
Thomas.

45:15.829 --> 45:17.664
I need to feel safe.

45:18.094 --> 45:19.094
We can not.

45:25.975 --> 45:26.975
Glory.

45:30.568 --> 45:31.849
Gloria, wait.

45:52.203 --> 45:53.203
Thomas.

47:07.589 --> 47:08.789
Please, Thomas.

47:10.762 --> 47:13.080
I need to go to a hospital.

47:21.775 --> 47:22.775
Trust me.

47:23.111 --> 47:24.345
I'll protect you.

47:37.273 --> 47:38.500
What if it's true?

47:45.703 --> 47:48.037
What if it's true?
- Is not true!

47:48.922 --> 47:50.249
None of this is real.

47:51.646 --> 47:54.083
There is no God.
There are no demons.

47:55.419 --> 47:56.952
There is no Abaddon.

47:59.576 --> 48:02.043
Something is happening to me!

48:08.342 --> 48:09.742
Gary! Where are you going?

48:10.217 --> 48:11.217
Kent said...

48:11.975 --> 48:13.443
Is that serious?

48:14.610 --> 48:15.899
Where are they going?

48:16.798 --> 48:18.213
Gloria is still lost!

48:18.237 --> 48:19.666
Are you giving up?

48:19.690 --> 48:20.782
Joan!

48:23.660 --> 48:26.034
Thank you very much
everyone for all help.

48:26.628 --> 48:27.695
Get some sleep.

48:27.957 --> 48:29.425
We'll get together
tomorrow morning.

48:29.449 --> 48:31.104
Surely we will have good news.

48:31.113 --> 48:32.379
What are you doing?

48:32.667 --> 48:34.230
Where were you? I
tried to call you.

48:34.254 --> 48:35.254
Searching!

48:35.588 --> 48:36.611
What is happening?

48:37.246 --> 48:38.754
A guy came in an hour ago.

48:38.914 --> 48:40.714
Lives on the other side
of the Gloria's house.

48:40.731 --> 48:44.931
I was traveling all day but came
here when he saw the brochure.

48:45.584 --> 48:47.122
This is Mr. Candle.

48:49.185 --> 48:51.185
Can you tell what you saw?
- Yes.

48:51.678 --> 48:54.068
I'm going to the
airport leave my wife.

48:54.084 --> 48:55.151
About 2 in the morning.

48:55.739 --> 48:59.168
And I saw a beige trailer stopped
in front of Gloria's house.

48:59.653 --> 49:02.918
There was a man in
the driver's seat.

49:03.184 --> 49:06.902
It would not have connected
much, Until I saw his face.

49:07.153 --> 49:08.567
What was on his face?

49:08.676 --> 49:11.043
It had scars on one
side all over.

49:13.322 --> 49:14.322
Scars?

49:16.439 --> 49:19.385
I called the police and I told them.
They are investigating.

49:22.627 --> 49:23.627
A beige trailer?

49:23.651 --> 49:24.651
Not only that.

49:24.932 --> 49:26.753
A friend of Gary saw
the same trailer

49:26.777 --> 49:29.809
leaving the city at high
speed half an hour later.

49:30.314 --> 49:31.314
Which way was he going?

49:31.338 --> 49:32.970
Leste to the conservation area.

49:32.987 --> 49:34.689
I just told the police.

49:34.713 --> 49:36.658
Let's go. We need your car.

49:37.026 --> 49:38.822
Where are we going? - East!

49:49.818 --> 49:51.218
I need a doctor.

49:52.419 --> 49:53.419
It's not safe.

49:54.192 --> 49:55.859
They're looking for us.

49:56.755 --> 49:57.755
Who?

49:58.087 --> 49:59.087
At this time?

49:59.400 --> 50:00.400
Everyone.

50:01.704 --> 50:04.117
We need to wait here
until the sunrise.

50:08.321 --> 50:09.321
Joan...

50:11.961 --> 50:13.305
I need Joan.

50:15.125 --> 50:16.765
She can help me.

50:18.124 --> 50:19.631
We can trust her.

50:20.678 --> 50:22.662
You do not know
what you're saying.

50:24.467 --> 50:25.967
You need to stay away from her.

50:25.991 --> 50:26.897
I need her!

50:26.921 --> 50:29.655
You need to stay away from her.

50:32.679 --> 50:33.679
What?

50:35.468 --> 50:36.935
Why you say that?

50:40.765 --> 50:42.616
Why are you saying this?

50:43.796 --> 50:45.196
Because I know her.

50:45.859 --> 50:46.859
Because?

50:47.296 --> 50:48.896
Why have you been watching us?

50:50.133 --> 50:51.133
Me watched.

50:56.087 --> 50:57.961
He knows nothing about her.

51:01.087 --> 51:02.087
Do not know?

51:07.235 --> 51:09.835
I know that because
of her you this one.

51:10.298 --> 51:12.298
The reason for being chained.

51:13.385 --> 51:16.785
She's the reason you have nightmares.
When you sleep.

51:18.799 --> 51:19.866
How do you know that?

51:20.151 --> 51:21.951
Because I have them too.

51:23.190 --> 51:24.963
She did it comgo.

51:26.591 --> 51:28.258
She ruined my leg.

51:28.576 --> 51:29.692
My life.

51:30.466 --> 51:33.388
And you will not hesitate
to do worse with yourself.

51:36.224 --> 51:37.891
She's looking for you.

51:38.701 --> 51:40.301
And if she finds you...

51:41.810 --> 51:44.277
You do not know how
wrong you were.

51:48.615 --> 51:49.615
You're lying.

51:52.388 --> 51:53.630
She loves Me.

51:57.732 --> 51:59.028
No, no.

51:59.075 --> 52:00.075
She...

52:00.099 --> 52:01.099
She loves Me.

52:01.123 --> 52:02.255
She loves You?

52:03.443 --> 52:06.109
She was there the
night they took you.

52:07.302 --> 52:09.388
She was singing with all of us.

52:09.599 --> 52:10.958
She was the chosen one.

52:11.185 --> 52:12.966
The only one left...

52:13.138 --> 52:14.671
to finish the ritual.

52:17.141 --> 52:19.141
You two have not met.

52:20.188 --> 52:21.547
She found you.

52:22.414 --> 52:24.148
And she was close to you.

52:24.391 --> 52:25.391
And waited.

52:25.407 --> 52:26.492
Until tonight.

52:29.113 --> 52:31.647
I realized I'm not the smartest.

52:33.145 --> 52:34.621
So I stayed here.

52:36.621 --> 52:37.754
And I waited.

52:38.650 --> 52:40.117
I waited until the moment,

52:40.603 --> 52:42.462
that I could get you
out of near her.

52:42.478 --> 52:45.470
- I do not believe you!
"And keep you safe!"

52:51.576 --> 52:52.776
Those scars.

52:54.287 --> 52:55.820
Did you see the scars?

52:57.388 --> 52:58.716
Her father beat her.

53:01.248 --> 53:02.708
Do they look like these?

53:08.568 --> 53:10.450
- He he...
- He beat me!

53:10.951 --> 53:12.700
He beat me up!

53:12.724 --> 53:14.661
And he never touched her.

53:16.162 --> 53:17.562
Because she had faith.

53:18.005 --> 53:19.716
She was a believer.

53:23.091 --> 53:24.224
Different than me.

53:26.326 --> 53:28.726
Every scar on Gwendolyn's body,

53:30.146 --> 53:31.346
she made it herself.

53:37.258 --> 53:38.391
Who is Gwendolyn?

53:41.883 --> 53:43.289
And your girlfriend.

53:47.367 --> 53:48.515
Is my sister.

53:49.711 --> 53:50.711
Joan?

53:53.046 --> 53:54.979
Joan was our mother's name.

54:00.086 --> 54:02.125
Did you see the
scar on your wrist?

54:02.648 --> 54:04.315
Did she tell you about it?

54:06.140 --> 54:07.473
She tried to kill herself.

54:09.531 --> 54:10.998
No, she did that...

54:12.062 --> 54:13.328
to hide it.

54:17.977 --> 54:18.977
No...

54:27.898 --> 54:28.898
I'll be right back.

57:45.366 --> 57:46.766
How did you get here?

57:47.709 --> 57:48.709
Where did he go?

57:50.998 --> 57:52.209
He was in the cabin.

57:52.334 --> 57:53.868
He was there. - Who?

57:55.216 --> 57:57.083
There is nobody here. Just me.

57:57.217 --> 57:59.193
No, no. He was there.

58:03.761 --> 58:04.761
In the cabin.

58:05.565 --> 58:06.565
He is there.

58:08.440 --> 58:09.440
Can you walk?

58:13.666 --> 58:14.666
Let's go.

59:01.659 --> 59:03.059
He was in the bedroom.

59:28.807 --> 59:30.007
There's nothing here.

59:30.518 --> 59:31.518
He was there.

59:33.432 --> 59:34.832
He was there. I saw.

59:59.667 --> 01:00:00.667
What?

01:00:01.761 --> 01:00:02.761
What's it?

01:00:07.151 --> 01:00:08.351
You should lie down.

01:00:09.932 --> 01:00:10.932
Do not.

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:13.299
No. You're not going to me.
Again.

01:00:14.409 --> 01:00:15.994
I'm trying to protect you.

01:00:16.018 --> 01:00:18.085
You're trying to
protect yourself!

01:00:21.926 --> 01:00:22.926
It is true.

01:00:24.598 --> 01:00:26.605
The thing they put inside me.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.840
You're coming to get
me, are not you?

01:00:34.606 --> 01:00:35.949
Right, Thomas?

01:00:36.402 --> 01:00:37.402
Do not.

01:00:39.824 --> 01:00:40.824
He's already got it.

01:00:46.605 --> 01:00:47.605
So...

01:00:48.713 --> 01:00:50.380
You wanna tell me
where we're going?

01:00:53.644 --> 01:00:55.710
It's just a feeling.

01:00:57.699 --> 01:00:58.699
Joan...

01:00:59.667 --> 01:01:02.721
If you know of something, we
should notify the police.

01:01:02.745 --> 01:01:03.745
Do not.

01:01:03.784 --> 01:01:05.237
Until I know for sure,

01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:07.863
I do not want them
to waste time.

01:01:14.693 --> 01:01:16.026
Turn right here.

01:01:33.735 --> 01:01:34.735
Over there.

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:38.493
Is here.

01:01:56.941 --> 01:01:59.007
Wow, you think
it's this trailer?

01:02:16.027 --> 01:02:17.227
Can you see something?

01:02:19.027 --> 01:02:20.027
What's it?

01:02:26.775 --> 01:02:28.227
Holy shit.

01:02:28.954 --> 01:02:30.376
Son of a bitch.

01:03:01.208 --> 01:03:02.674
Just a few more hours.

01:03:03.708 --> 01:03:04.908
And everything will end.

01:03:42.386 --> 01:03:44.853
I'll see you when the next one.
Moon rise

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.160
Thomas.

01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:28.431
Thomas.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.095
Thomas, help me.

01:04:43.734 --> 01:04:44.734
Do not.

01:04:47.015 --> 01:04:48.374
You promised me.

01:04:52.148 --> 01:04:54.681
He promised to wait
until Sunrise!

01:04:57.562 --> 01:04:59.562
You've put up with too much.

01:05:01.378 --> 01:05:02.691
I will not let them take you.

01:05:02.715 --> 01:05:03.715
No!

01:05:04.073 --> 01:05:05.073
Thomas!

01:05:06.464 --> 01:05:07.464
Thomas!

01:05:09.074 --> 01:05:10.557
Thomas!

01:05:24.157 --> 01:05:26.844
When I am reborn I will
lead your soul first.

01:05:29.376 --> 01:05:30.509
What did you say?

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:34.440
What was it you said?
- I do not know!

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:36.287
I did not say anything!

01:05:53.351 --> 01:05:55.684
We want you to come
with us, Thomas.

01:05:56.102 --> 01:05:58.302
That's just a taste of hell.

01:05:58.547 --> 01:05:59.547
Please.

01:05:59.707 --> 01:06:00.894
I can change.

01:06:02.379 --> 01:06:04.379
I will not run away.
I can change!

01:06:04.644 --> 01:06:06.111
I will not run away again.

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:09.340
No!

01:06:09.809 --> 01:06:10.809
No!

01:06:45.529 --> 01:06:46.716
Hello, brother.

01:06:47.897 --> 01:06:49.163
Welcome back.

01:07:32.483 --> 01:07:33.483
Hi love.

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:38.100
Joan?

01:07:38.496 --> 01:07:39.496
Yes.

01:07:40.736 --> 01:07:41.736
I'm here.

01:07:42.943 --> 01:07:44.610
I knew I would find you.

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:46.100
Joan.

01:07:46.585 --> 01:07:47.785
Joan, he said...

01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:50.710
It's all right.

01:07:52.158 --> 01:07:53.824
It's going to be okay now.

01:07:58.673 --> 01:07:59.673
Take me out of here.

01:08:03.087 --> 01:08:04.087
No love.

01:08:06.095 --> 01:08:08.602
I think it best to get you arrested.
For this part.

01:08:14.665 --> 01:08:15.719
Has begun.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.680
Joan.

01:08:18.765 --> 01:08:20.033
What are you doing?

01:08:20.055 --> 01:08:20.953
Where's Thomas?

01:08:20.962 --> 01:08:21.962
Hey.

01:08:22.604 --> 01:08:23.604
Look at me.

01:08:24.557 --> 01:08:27.557
No need to worry anymore
with my brother.

01:08:34.822 --> 01:08:36.488
I have something for you.

01:08:46.761 --> 01:08:47.761
You hated it.

01:08:50.504 --> 01:08:51.904
I already knew I would.

01:08:54.292 --> 01:08:55.410
I got blood.

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:01.136
You are crazy.

01:09:02.006 --> 01:09:03.006
Am I really?

01:09:07.404 --> 01:09:08.738
Look at yourself.

01:09:11.256 --> 01:09:12.904
I barely recognize you.

01:09:17.671 --> 01:09:19.671
I wish you could come with me.

01:09:21.412 --> 01:09:22.412
I really wanted.

01:09:24.194 --> 01:09:26.794
We could have been
so happy together.

01:09:28.468 --> 01:09:29.468
In the other life.

01:09:30.273 --> 01:09:32.139
Where will you live forever.

01:09:33.154 --> 01:09:35.154
I did not want you to burn.

01:09:37.866 --> 01:09:38.866
But you go.

01:09:46.366 --> 01:09:47.514
I forgot about that.

01:10:02.568 --> 01:10:03.841
Happy Birthday.

01:10:06.208 --> 01:10:08.989
Protection for my little cocoon.

01:10:14.796 --> 01:10:15.796
I hate you.

01:10:17.507 --> 01:10:18.840
Can not wait...

01:10:19.179 --> 01:10:20.579
Until this is over.

01:10:21.489 --> 01:10:23.894
And you will see that no
there is nothing later.

01:10:26.582 --> 01:10:27.910
I hate you!

01:10:31.526 --> 01:10:32.993
I need to get dressed.

01:10:35.198 --> 01:10:36.731
We have work to do.

01:11:40.503 --> 01:11:42.807
I can not believe you remembered.
This place.

01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:47.229
I had what?

01:11:47.423 --> 01:11:50.564
8 years? Last time that
our parents brought us?

01:11:52.151 --> 01:11:53.884
You were afraid of the dark.

01:11:55.596 --> 01:11:57.063
Not much has changed.

01:11:58.424 --> 01:11:59.424
Gwen...

01:11:59.611 --> 01:12:00.611
please...

01:12:02.354 --> 01:12:03.354
Stop.

01:12:03.971 --> 01:12:06.018
I have not heard that
name for a time.

01:12:07.159 --> 01:12:10.225
It's because everyone
who knew they are dead.

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:13.961
I need to admit...

01:12:14.448 --> 01:12:15.515
You deceived me.

01:12:16.269 --> 01:12:17.935
I thought he was dead.

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.221
Maybe my faith in you
has I get confused.

01:12:25.456 --> 01:12:26.523
Can you feel it?

01:12:29.714 --> 01:12:30.714
He is coming.

01:12:32.722 --> 01:12:35.237
Did you live with doubts?
For so long.

01:12:37.261 --> 01:12:38.394
But look at her.

01:12:39.206 --> 01:12:41.006
Our Lord is coming.

01:12:43.903 --> 01:12:45.569
You can feel them
here, can not you?

01:12:47.458 --> 01:12:48.458
Mother.

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:50.700
Dad.

01:12:52.161 --> 01:12:53.161
All of them.

01:12:55.895 --> 01:12:56.962
Beg, Thomas.

01:12:58.090 --> 01:12:59.690
Even with little time.

01:13:00.489 --> 01:13:02.012
Beg for your soul.

01:13:03.637 --> 01:13:05.104
You can still redeem yourself.

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:08.607
Think about how long
eternity lasts.

01:13:08.926 --> 01:13:09.926
Gwen!

01:13:10.981 --> 01:13:11.981
Stop!

01:13:12.738 --> 01:13:13.738
Gwen!

01:13:51.414 --> 01:13:53.259
You said you loved me.

01:13:54.627 --> 01:13:56.960
Oh, my sweet and
precious little thing.

01:13:57.494 --> 01:13:58.759
I do love you.

01:14:00.197 --> 01:14:01.837
I love you so much.

01:14:02.822 --> 01:14:05.517
You will bring our
Lord to this world.

01:14:06.002 --> 01:14:07.392
The final sacrifice.

01:14:10.462 --> 01:14:13.134
Many have waited so
long for that day.

01:14:14.353 --> 01:14:15.953
And he finally arrived.

01:14:18.697 --> 01:14:19.697
Finally.

01:14:20.423 --> 01:14:21.557
We will be free.

01:16:17.415 --> 01:16:18.415
Thomas.

01:16:23.619 --> 01:16:24.619
You came.

01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:26.950
I'm happy for that.

01:16:27.934 --> 01:16:28.934
You're lying.

01:16:29.036 --> 01:16:30.036
No my love.

01:16:31.308 --> 01:16:32.424
Is not it beautiful?

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:35.643
Everything you see is ours.

01:16:36.745 --> 01:16:37.987
Is not real.

01:16:38.542 --> 01:16:39.609
It's real for us.

01:16:40.823 --> 01:16:41.823
You and I.

01:16:42.941 --> 01:16:44.088
In Paradise.

01:16:44.722 --> 01:16:45.788
For eternity.

01:16:47.151 --> 01:16:48.151
Is not real.

01:16:52.964 --> 01:16:54.838
No reason to doubt, Thomas.

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.865
Repent and be saved.

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:16.687
Free yourself, Thomas.

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:15.950
Please, Thomas.

01:18:16.172 --> 01:18:17.172
Shoot.

01:19:58.531 --> 01:19:59.531
Gwen, stop!

01:20:03.891 --> 01:20:04.891
Gwen!

01:20:05.477 --> 01:20:07.277
Do not force me to do that!

01:20:08.039 --> 01:20:09.039
Stop!

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:12.320
Gwen, stop!

01:21:16.312 --> 01:21:17.312
Oh no...

01:22:58.325 --> 01:23:00.125
I promised you the sunrise.

01:23:15.005 --> 01:23:16.005
Thomas?

01:23:19.787 --> 01:23:20.787
You...

01:23:25.466 --> 01:23:26.466
Are you alive.

01:23:26.818 --> 01:23:27.818
Ended.

01:23:37.174 --> 01:23:38.424
I told you.

01:23:41.041 --> 01:23:42.041
You told me what?

01:23:47.826 --> 01:23:49.786
That I would take
your soul first.

01:23:53.123 --> 01:23:55.589
You will burn for all eternity.

01:23:57.079 --> 01:23:58.345
And his suffering...

01:23:58.813 --> 01:23:59.813
begins...

01:24:00.665 --> 01:24:01.665
now!
