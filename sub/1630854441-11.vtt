00:01.784 --> 00:04.439
<i>Being a Hunter means always
being on the move,</i>

00:04.439 --> 00:06.310
<i>No matter how hard you plan,</i>

00:06.310 --> 00:09.357
<i>no matter how hard you work,
at a certain point,</i>

00:09.357 --> 00:11.881
<i>we all run out of road.</i>

00:11.881 --> 00:14.014
<i>It's what we do
with those crossroads</i>

00:14.014 --> 00:16.277
<i>that defines us.</i>

00:16.277 --> 00:18.931
You know, for an old man,
Wilcox could still throw down.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.156
My preserved chimera foot,

00:26.156 --> 00:28.028
she's ruined.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.812
Don't worry.

00:29.812 --> 00:31.683
We're gonna give you
all the space you need

00:31.683 --> 00:33.555
during this
very difficult time.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.557
On the bright side,
you lost a paw,

00:35.557 --> 00:38.734
but we gained all
of Wilcox's Akrida research.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.040
So there has to be
something in here

00:40.040 --> 00:42.520
that can make up
for all of this.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.397
Another golem?

00:55.490 --> 00:57.231
John?

01:05.413 --> 01:07.893
Oh, my God.

01:07.893 --> 01:10.157
What happened?
Where are you hurt?

01:10.157 --> 01:12.159
It's not my blood.

01:14.813 --> 01:16.424
It's Kyle's.

01:26.651 --> 01:30.133
He just kept stabbing himself
over and over.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.830
He wouldn't stop.

01:34.311 --> 01:36.270
Okay,
so the Akrida-controlled Kyle

01:36.270 --> 01:37.923
called the police?

01:37.923 --> 01:39.795
Yeah.

01:39.795 --> 01:42.537
And they left the journal
at his apartment, too.

01:42.537 --> 01:45.583
Wrote a bunch of entries about
how I'd been harassing Kyle.

01:48.412 --> 01:50.284
Over you.

01:54.723 --> 01:58.118
Ny mom got there
and, uh, he was...

02:00.250 --> 02:02.339
Dead.

02:02.339 --> 02:03.819
The cops were behind her
so she gave me the keys

02:03.819 --> 02:05.603
to a junk car.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.997
Told me to lay low
so I came here.

02:07.997 --> 02:10.173
Were you followed?

02:10.173 --> 02:11.696
No.

02:11.696 --> 02:13.176
I parked around the block
just to be sure.

02:15.613 --> 02:17.920
I'm sorry.
Okay, if-if I was--

02:17.920 --> 02:19.139
if I was faster,
I-I could have--

02:19.139 --> 02:22.185
I could have stopped--
- Hey.

02:22.185 --> 02:25.362
You did everything you could.

02:25.362 --> 02:27.538
What happened to Kyle
was terrible,

02:27.538 --> 02:28.974
but it wasn't your fault.

02:32.195 --> 02:34.284
It doesn't make any sense.

02:34.284 --> 02:36.765
I mean, why would the Akrida
want to frame you?

02:36.765 --> 02:38.332
What are they after?

02:38.332 --> 02:41.204
Well, whatever the reason is,
it worked.

02:41.204 --> 02:42.684
I've been listening
to the police radio

02:42.684 --> 02:44.773
and they have
all the cops in Lawrence

02:44.773 --> 02:46.383
out looking for John.

02:46.383 --> 02:47.950
All right.

02:47.950 --> 02:49.778
So we'll...

02:49.778 --> 02:52.346
No. Not "we," okay?

02:54.609 --> 02:56.654
Just me.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.874
Look, we have no idea
what the Akrida are planning.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.832
But, look,
I don't want anyone else

03:00.832 --> 03:03.052
to get mixed up in it.
- I'm already mixed up in it.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.575
Okay, the two of you need
to get out of town

03:04.575 --> 03:05.968
and out of sight.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.622
Uh...

03:07.622 --> 03:09.363
what about my dad's
hunting cabin?

03:09.363 --> 03:11.887
Burr Oak is definitely
off the grid.

03:11.887 --> 03:13.193
- Yeah.
- Look, the Akrida knew

03:13.193 --> 03:14.629
about you and me.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.805
Okay? That's why
they controlled Kyle.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.372
And we have no idea
how many more people

03:18.372 --> 03:22.071
they're in control of.
- He's right.

03:22.071 --> 03:23.333
I mean, the Akrida
could be controlling

03:23.333 --> 03:24.943
anyone at this point.

03:24.943 --> 03:27.772
Unless someone has some sort
of X-ray specs

03:27.772 --> 03:30.122
or a truth serum that makes
people spill their secrets--

03:30.122 --> 03:32.560
Or Maggie's bracelet.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.692
Maggie's what?

03:34.692 --> 03:36.477
She told me
she had this bracelet

03:36.477 --> 03:38.305
that could pinpoint
anyone harboring a dark secret

03:38.305 --> 03:39.697
like being a monster.

03:39.697 --> 03:41.612
Maybe it could work
on the Akrida.

03:41.612 --> 03:44.136
Why did Maggie never tell me
about this before?

03:44.136 --> 03:45.921
I don't know.

03:45.921 --> 03:48.445
Looks like Maggie was keeping
secrets herself.

03:50.621 --> 03:52.536
Regardless,
if it's still in the house,

03:52.536 --> 03:54.146
then it might be of use to us.

03:54.146 --> 03:55.757
We can go back there
and search.

03:55.757 --> 03:58.063
The two of you need to get
to that cabin.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.674
Shall we?

04:01.415 --> 04:04.461
Don't forget your breathing, okay?

04:04.461 --> 04:06.333
And just remember,
what happened last night,

04:06.333 --> 04:09.118
it was not your fault.

04:10.685 --> 04:14.602
As much as I don't like
to admit when Lata's right,

04:14.602 --> 04:18.040
you should definitely listen
to your meditation guru, John.

04:22.087 --> 04:23.088
Okay, if you guys find anything,

04:23.088 --> 04:25.308
just hit up the CB or call.

04:28.529 --> 04:30.357
They're right.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.576
You know that, don't you?

04:34.622 --> 04:38.278
Look, they clearly know
about me.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.627
Okay? About my past. I--

04:39.627 --> 04:42.717
Your past
does not define you.

04:42.717 --> 04:45.197
And they showed their hand.

04:45.197 --> 04:46.764
- What do you mean?
- All of this

04:46.764 --> 04:48.418
just to get to you?

04:48.418 --> 04:52.030
I mean, clearly you're a threat
to the Akrida.

04:52.030 --> 04:55.425
That means you're doing
something right.

04:55.425 --> 04:56.687
Hey.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.909
We're gonna figure this out.

05:15.271 --> 05:18.492
All that blood...
- I know.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.885
I mean, of course,
I believe John, it's just...

05:20.885 --> 05:23.714
It's like Mars Neto
all over again.

05:26.064 --> 05:28.110
Has he been meditating?

05:28.110 --> 05:30.286
Not for weeks.

05:30.286 --> 05:31.853
I mean, why do you think
the Akrida's

05:31.853 --> 05:34.159
targeting him like this?

05:34.159 --> 05:35.944
I don't know.

05:35.944 --> 05:37.989
I mean, clearly,
they want him off the board.

05:37.989 --> 05:39.774
They've manipulated us before.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.515
It feels like they're
doing this all over again,

05:41.515 --> 05:43.430
but this time using
John's record against him

05:43.430 --> 05:44.996
and having the police
do the dirty work.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.824
Right.

05:46.824 --> 05:49.914
And our best bet at helping him
is either in this room

05:49.914 --> 05:53.831
or buried somewhere
we are never going to find.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.529
Okay, you know, why did Maggie

05:55.529 --> 05:57.052
keep this damn bracelet
a secret?

05:57.052 --> 05:58.662
Okay? It doesn't seem like her.

05:58.662 --> 06:01.926
People conceal things
for all sorts of reasons,

06:01.926 --> 06:03.275
logical or not.

06:13.808 --> 06:16.941
Look at you two idiots.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.421
We were on our way to see
Alice Cooper

06:18.421 --> 06:21.076
at the Cowtown Ballroom.

06:21.076 --> 06:25.559
You went and saw Alice
without me?

06:25.559 --> 06:27.474
I'm sorry.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.127
So sorry.
- Nope. Mm-mm.

06:29.127 --> 06:31.086
Retroactively
never forgiving you for that.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.958
Okay. Well...

06:33.958 --> 06:35.482
And...

06:35.482 --> 06:36.961
We had just stopped for snacks

06:36.961 --> 06:40.095
'cause Maggie was obsessed
with Toastettes.

06:45.013 --> 06:48.538
Oh, my God, I think I know
where to find the bracelet.

06:50.061 --> 06:52.542
"Oh, I know where
to find the bracelet."

06:56.372 --> 06:58.069
I love you.

07:00.158 --> 07:01.464
Even on the back roads,

07:01.464 --> 07:03.379
we can still make it
by morning.

07:03.379 --> 07:06.164
You're not going anywhere.

07:06.164 --> 07:08.340
- Betty, I can explain--
- You'll get your day in court.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.690
You don't understand.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.866
The whole town
is looking for you.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.824
The way they're talking,
you're lucky it's me

07:13.824 --> 07:15.565
who found you first.

07:15.565 --> 07:18.046
How did you find me?

07:18.046 --> 07:20.004
I've been following you
for weeks.

07:20.004 --> 07:21.615
Ever since Kyle reached out.

07:21.615 --> 07:22.703
I don't know
what Kyle told you,

07:22.703 --> 07:25.706
but John didn't kill anyone.

07:25.706 --> 07:29.013
Look, I'm trying
to help here.

07:29.013 --> 07:31.015
Please don't make
a bad day worse.

07:35.716 --> 07:37.718
We're gonna figure this out.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.502
All right?

07:42.940 --> 07:44.333
All right.

07:56.432 --> 07:58.782
Okay, uh,
not to doubt your genius,

07:58.782 --> 08:01.655
but the room where people have
three meals a day

08:01.655 --> 08:04.614
is Maggie's secret hiding spot?

08:04.614 --> 08:06.398
Mary and Samuel both shared

08:06.398 --> 08:07.704
Maggie's obsession
with Toastettes.

08:07.704 --> 08:11.142
'Scuse me.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.493
Samuel Campbell? Toastettes?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.582
The man contained
many layers.

08:15.582 --> 08:16.974
It would get quite cutthroat
around here

08:16.974 --> 08:18.628
over who would get
the last one.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.978
That's why Maggie kept
her own private stash.

08:24.329 --> 08:26.114
Rat poison?

08:26.114 --> 08:28.159
The last place
you look for treats.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.035
Incredible.

08:40.955 --> 08:44.611
Oh, amazing.

08:44.611 --> 08:45.960
So what's the bracelet for?

08:45.960 --> 08:48.223
Well, according to legend,

08:48.223 --> 08:51.052
it was made by Erebus,
the god of secrets and shadows,

08:51.052 --> 08:52.836
as a tool to give
to his followers

08:52.836 --> 08:56.797
to uncover their enemies'
hidden secrets.

08:56.797 --> 08:57.885
So you just put
the bracelet on

08:57.885 --> 09:00.583
and presto,

09:00.583 --> 09:03.847
monster-vision?

09:10.201 --> 09:13.030
It's stuck.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.730
That can't be good, can it?

09:16.730 --> 09:18.688
O-okay.
Well, take a deep breath.

09:18.688 --> 09:21.822
You know, Maggie was able to
get it off at some point, so...

09:21.822 --> 09:23.606
We'll focus on this later.
We need to make sure

09:23.606 --> 09:26.000
this thing actually works,
so come on.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.134
Let's actually see
who's naughty and who's nice.

09:36.053 --> 09:38.012
Did you see that?

09:39.622 --> 09:41.493
Ah!

09:49.632 --> 09:50.981
Any luck?

09:50.981 --> 09:52.983
Every door and window
is sealed.

09:52.983 --> 09:54.768
And the CB radio and phone
are both dead.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.117
And I tried to call
for Ford and Carrie,

09:56.117 --> 09:58.162
but nothing.

09:58.162 --> 10:00.251
Any luck with that bracelet?

10:00.251 --> 10:01.862
It won't budge.

10:01.862 --> 10:04.038
And it feels like
it's getting tighter somehow.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.518
So chicken and egg situation
here, monster-wise, right?

10:06.518 --> 10:07.955
Right.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.434
The shadow that we saw
slam the door,

10:09.434 --> 10:11.698
was it a monster
that the bracelet detected

10:11.698 --> 10:13.874
or was it tied to the bracelet?

10:13.874 --> 10:15.310
Well, either way,
I'm starting to understand

10:15.310 --> 10:17.225
why Maggie wanted
to keep it a secret.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.705
All right?
I wouldn't want any bracelet

10:18.705 --> 10:21.533
holding me hostage
in this house, either.

10:21.533 --> 10:25.102
Okay, we need to find
its record in the lore.

10:25.102 --> 10:27.888
Then we'll have our answer.
Just check there.

10:33.807 --> 10:36.331
Okay. Thanks, Walt.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.900
I know. And I appreciate that.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.772
Anything?

10:42.772 --> 10:45.253
I talked to the hardware
store owner next door

10:45.253 --> 10:47.516
to my garage and the owner
of the bar across the street.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.997
Nobody saw Kyle
break into the garage.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.738
Walt's gonna check
with the construction crew

10:51.738 --> 10:54.610
who's been doing his remodel.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.786
I mean, there has to be
someone who saw something.

10:56.786 --> 10:59.484
The cops that questioned you,
anything seem off about them?

10:59.484 --> 11:02.400
You mean,
were they secretly bugs? No.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.837
They just wanted to know
where John was

11:03.837 --> 11:05.403
and what I knew about Kyle.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.841
I told them, "I don't know"
and "Who's Kyle?"

11:11.932 --> 11:15.544
Mary, I'm sorry.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.981
John told me that
the two of you were friends.

11:17.981 --> 11:20.157
Yeah.

11:20.157 --> 11:24.771
To be honest, I don't think
it's really set in yet.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.903
But I do know one thing.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.949
He didn't deserve any of this.

11:32.561 --> 11:35.390
I hate to ask...

11:35.390 --> 11:38.959
but after Kyle,
you don't think Betty...

11:38.959 --> 11:40.612
No.

11:40.612 --> 11:42.658
I could see it in her eyes.

11:42.658 --> 11:44.921
She was heartbroken
taking away John like that.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.838
Those two,
they were really, um...

11:48.838 --> 11:51.058
Yeah, they were.

11:55.192 --> 11:58.848
Which makes me think

11:58.848 --> 12:01.677
that we can trust her.

12:01.677 --> 12:03.548
Trust her with what?

12:03.548 --> 12:05.725
All this.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.683
The Akrida have cops
on the inside.

12:07.683 --> 12:09.337
If we want to help John,

12:09.337 --> 12:11.252
maybe we need a cop
on the inside, too.

12:21.349 --> 12:24.439
Thought you could use that.

12:24.439 --> 12:27.007
You been watchin' me
through there?

12:27.007 --> 12:29.661
No. No one is.

12:29.661 --> 12:33.187
Detective Klett
locked the viewing room.

12:33.187 --> 12:35.580
Please tell me
you believe me.

12:35.580 --> 12:38.758
Thanks for bringin' him in,
Officer Donelon.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.237
Could we have a minute?

12:40.237 --> 12:41.761
Of course, sir.

12:50.117 --> 12:52.684
You two go way back,
don't you?

12:52.684 --> 12:54.948
It's gotta sting,

12:54.948 --> 12:56.906
being busted by your ex.

12:56.906 --> 12:59.648
Sorry, just--

12:59.648 --> 13:02.782
I mean, she must have known
this day was coming, right?

13:02.782 --> 13:04.522
I mean, she's known you
when all this started.

13:04.522 --> 13:08.309
Look, assault,
disorderly conduct, vandalism.

13:08.309 --> 13:10.050
Eh, just a few
of your greatest hits.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.792
I know my record.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.532
Okay, but I...

13:14.532 --> 13:17.187
I didn't kill Kyle.

13:17.187 --> 13:19.450
Look...

13:20.712 --> 13:22.453
The boys in evidence
just bagged and tagged

13:22.453 --> 13:24.281
Kyle's journal.

13:24.281 --> 13:26.327
Last two entries?

13:26.327 --> 13:28.198
All about you.

13:28.198 --> 13:30.548
Some kind of dispute
over a girl named...

13:30.548 --> 13:33.943
oh... Mary Campbell.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.205
It wasn't even like that, okay?

13:35.205 --> 13:36.990
I-I only met the kid once.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.824
Can't you see
I'm trying to help you?

13:44.824 --> 13:48.305
I'm trying to be a friend here.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.307
I know you didn't kill Kyle.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.795
I did.

13:59.795 --> 14:01.536
I told you I'd see you again.

14:01.536 --> 14:03.059
You want to take a swing?
Go on. Go on.

14:03.059 --> 14:04.974
Add another charge
onto this garbage dump

14:04.974 --> 14:06.541
of your record,
if you want to.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.717
Have at it.
It only makes my job easier.

14:08.717 --> 14:10.632
Motive, means,

14:10.632 --> 14:12.764
lengthy criminal history,

14:12.764 --> 14:14.157
no witnesses
to help your story.

14:14.157 --> 14:15.855
You're toast, Winchester.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.509
And before you go on
about due process

14:18.509 --> 14:20.598
and democracy
and all that jazz,

14:20.598 --> 14:22.035
do you really think
it's gonna be

14:22.035 --> 14:25.255
a jury of your peers
or a jury of mine?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.911
What do you want?

14:28.911 --> 14:31.522
Sit down.

14:31.522 --> 14:32.828
Sit down!

14:36.658 --> 14:39.008
I wanna know who this is

14:39.008 --> 14:42.359
and why he's helping you.

14:42.359 --> 14:43.839
I have no idea who that is.

14:46.015 --> 14:48.061
I just...

14:48.061 --> 14:50.324
stubbornness in the face
of oblivion.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.152
Honestly, that's
one of the few traits

14:52.152 --> 14:55.372
I respect about you humans.

14:55.372 --> 14:56.896
You...

14:56.896 --> 14:58.419
yeah, you've got a thing

14:58.419 --> 15:01.204
about getting yourself caught,
don't you?

15:01.204 --> 15:02.902
How long were you a P.O.W.?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.861
Long enough to learn
how to take the heat.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.036
Well...

15:07.036 --> 15:09.212
We'll see about that.

15:09.212 --> 15:10.779
I'm gonna leave you to sit

15:10.779 --> 15:13.390
in your sad little thoughts
and feelings.

15:13.390 --> 15:15.610
If you ever want to taste
freedom again,

15:15.610 --> 15:18.874
you're gonna have to talk.

15:18.874 --> 15:21.572
Ball's in your court, Marine.

15:33.671 --> 15:34.977
I found something.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.631
Maggie didn't hide the bracelet

15:36.631 --> 15:38.285
because it holds
people hostage.

15:38.285 --> 15:41.244
Let me guess,
there's a catch?

15:42.985 --> 15:44.378
"Whosoever wears
this bracelet

15:44.378 --> 15:46.075
"must be pure of heart.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.990
"Should they harbor
a dark secret of their own,

15:47.990 --> 15:49.600
"shadow spirits
embedded in the bracelet

15:49.600 --> 15:54.431
"will force the wearer
to reveal that secret,

15:54.431 --> 15:56.956
or the shadows
will consume them."

15:56.956 --> 16:00.785
Wait,
so what you're saying is,

16:00.785 --> 16:05.703
is that you have a dark secret?

16:05.703 --> 16:07.488
You?

16:07.488 --> 16:09.533
I mean, like, what?
Overdue library books?

16:09.533 --> 16:12.841
Uh, I don't know what the
bracelet found in me, but...

16:12.841 --> 16:15.017
Lata, look out!

16:18.281 --> 16:20.153
Carlos!

16:20.153 --> 16:21.981
Carlos, where are you?

16:31.599 --> 16:33.818
What the hell?

16:43.219 --> 16:45.091
<i>Carlos!</i>

16:45.091 --> 16:46.831
<i>Lata!</i>

16:46.831 --> 16:49.965
<i>I'm locked in a room!
Lata?</i>

16:49.965 --> 16:51.575
<i>Lata, where are you?</i>

16:54.883 --> 16:56.711
<i>Carlos?</i>

17:06.634 --> 17:09.724
- Carlos!
<i>- Lata!</i>

17:11.334 --> 17:13.902
<i>It's freezing in here!</i>

17:13.902 --> 17:15.947
- Carlos!
- <i>Lata!</i>

17:16.948 --> 17:18.994
<i>Where are you?</i>

17:18.994 --> 17:21.040
Lata?

17:21.040 --> 17:23.564
What is this place?

17:26.436 --> 17:28.221
<i>The windows and doors
are locked.</i>

17:28.221 --> 17:31.441
<i>There's no way out.
Lata!</i>

17:31.441 --> 17:33.965
Carlos!

17:36.620 --> 17:37.839
Hey, sweet pea.

17:40.276 --> 17:42.104
Millie, where are we going?

17:42.104 --> 17:44.367
Please, Betty, trust me.

17:50.199 --> 17:53.550
What the hell
is all that?

18:00.601 --> 18:02.516
And what is she doing here?

18:02.516 --> 18:04.648
She's with me.

18:04.648 --> 18:07.999
- Thanks for coming.
- I'm not here for you.

18:07.999 --> 18:10.132
I'm here for John.

18:10.132 --> 18:13.135
And how exactly
does dragging me to a...

18:13.135 --> 18:15.268
horror movie prop collection
help him?

18:15.268 --> 18:17.835
These aren't props.

18:17.835 --> 18:20.403
John says you're a great cop,
so I'm assuming you've noticed

18:20.403 --> 18:23.798
that something has been off
in Lawrence recently.

18:23.798 --> 18:27.193
Everything that's been off,
you've been around for.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.585
The bank truck heist,

18:28.585 --> 18:30.065
my neighbor Carrie
going missing--

18:30.065 --> 18:31.719
that didn't go down
the way you think.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.808
Did you and John even meet
at college?

18:38.508 --> 18:40.728
We met hunting monsters.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.426
You're joking.

18:44.775 --> 18:47.648
Betty,
I know what you're feeling.

18:47.648 --> 18:50.607
- You can't believe--
- I participated in a séance

18:50.607 --> 18:53.262
that brought my husband back.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.916
And that bank heist?

18:54.916 --> 18:57.397
I saw those vampires
face to face

18:57.397 --> 18:59.747
a few floors below this.

18:59.747 --> 19:02.532
We are telling you the truth, Betty.

19:05.927 --> 19:10.192
Okay, okay.

19:10.192 --> 19:15.502
Let's pretend for a second
that both of you are not crazy.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.460
What does any of this
have to do with

19:17.460 --> 19:20.159
what's going on with John?

19:23.423 --> 19:25.816
John didn't kill Kyle.

19:25.816 --> 19:28.906
Kyle killed himself.

19:28.906 --> 19:30.256
He was possessed.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.083
And the things
that possessed him

19:32.083 --> 19:34.129
are taking over people
all over town,

19:34.129 --> 19:36.914
including some
in your own department.

19:39.569 --> 19:41.136
They're called Akrida,
and they're setting John up--

19:41.136 --> 19:43.965
Okay, stop.

19:43.965 --> 19:47.621
Her, I can expect this from.

19:47.621 --> 19:51.233
But you? I trusted you.

19:51.233 --> 19:54.541
Came here alone like you asked

19:54.541 --> 19:56.282
because you said
you wanted to help John.

19:56.282 --> 20:00.068
But instead you want me
to play make-believe?

20:00.068 --> 20:02.940
Betty, it's not like the--

20:02.940 --> 20:05.465
No, you don't understand.

20:05.465 --> 20:08.076
John's arraignment got pushed
through to tonight.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.947
Then he's getting shipped off
to state prison.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.993
- What?
- Someone on high

20:11.993 --> 20:14.430
thinks he's a flight risk.
- That's the Akrida.

20:14.430 --> 20:15.866
I'm telling you, they're set--

20:15.866 --> 20:17.651
Okay,
I don't have time for this,

20:17.651 --> 20:19.609
for whatever you two
are playing at here.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.568
Wait, Betty,
check the coroner's report

20:21.568 --> 20:23.439
for three marks
on the back of Kyle's neck.

20:23.439 --> 20:25.659
Those are tell-tale signs...

20:25.659 --> 20:27.965
of the Akrida.

20:31.795 --> 20:33.232
I'm sorry.
I-I thought that she--

20:33.232 --> 20:35.408
No. We tried your way.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.975
And now we're gonna try mine.

20:37.975 --> 20:41.022
That was a good day, huh?

20:41.022 --> 20:43.329
It was.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.896
We had
a lot of good days together.

20:45.896 --> 20:49.073
We did.

20:49.073 --> 20:51.902
You wanna talk about it?

20:51.902 --> 20:53.904
The fact
that you're not real.

20:56.516 --> 20:59.301
You haven't changed, Lata.

20:59.301 --> 21:02.565
You still hold everything
close to the vest.

21:02.565 --> 21:05.612
Where did you take my friend?

21:05.612 --> 21:10.007
Oh, I think you know exactly
where he is, deep down.

21:10.007 --> 21:14.229
But you're holding back
your secrets like always.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.318
And that's why
you're seeing me.

21:16.318 --> 21:19.582
I was always the one
you'd talk to.

21:19.582 --> 21:20.931
But not about everything.

21:23.934 --> 21:25.980
That's not true.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.373
Come on, sweet pea.

21:27.373 --> 21:32.203
You do not get
to call me that.

21:32.203 --> 21:36.599
Fine. Latika.

21:36.599 --> 21:38.514
But you know it's true.

21:38.514 --> 21:42.997
Whatever I am is right.

21:42.997 --> 21:44.564
I'm a figment
of your imagination.

21:44.564 --> 21:47.610
You lie to me,
you're only lying to yourself.

21:47.610 --> 21:52.049
And you know that sweet,
loving, dear old Maggie

21:52.049 --> 21:56.010
shared everything with you,

21:56.010 --> 21:59.013
and it hurt her,

21:59.013 --> 22:02.321
knowing you never shared
your own secrets in return.

22:06.455 --> 22:09.937
This is your chance
to right that wrong.

22:09.937 --> 22:13.680
Don't make
the same mistake twice.

22:13.680 --> 22:17.423
Or you and your friend
won't ever see the sun again.

22:22.776 --> 22:25.561
Carlos! Carlos!

22:29.826 --> 22:33.874
Carlos!

22:33.874 --> 22:37.094
You're okay.
I'm gonna get you warm.

22:37.094 --> 22:38.835
You're okay.
Just stay here, okay?

22:41.142 --> 22:42.752
Hey.

22:47.844 --> 22:49.803
Okay.

22:49.803 --> 22:51.805
This is all my fault.

22:52.980 --> 22:55.069
But I'm gonna
get you out of here.

22:55.069 --> 22:56.810
I promise.

22:58.681 --> 23:00.204
Come on.

23:03.556 --> 23:05.862
Okay. Okay.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.560
Come. Come, come.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.170
Come near the fire.

23:13.087 --> 23:14.828
Watch it.

23:14.828 --> 23:16.395
Okay.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.222
T-t-tried ev-everything.

23:18.222 --> 23:22.009
But... this room is locked down
like the house was.

23:24.185 --> 23:26.274
There's no way
of getting out of here.

23:26.274 --> 23:29.320
I don't think
it's just getting colder.

23:33.281 --> 23:35.196
It's getting darker.

23:38.286 --> 23:41.245
How'd you get
that thing going?

23:41.245 --> 23:44.161
Uh...

23:44.161 --> 23:46.425
Muscle memory.

23:46.425 --> 23:50.733
You've been locked in
creepy old shacks before?

23:57.087 --> 24:00.613
This was a part of my home.

24:05.705 --> 24:07.097
Okay, I get it.

24:07.097 --> 24:09.186
I was young and dumb once, too.

24:09.186 --> 24:12.538
But maybe we should pump
the brakes here for a second.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.191
No.

24:14.191 --> 24:15.758
You heard what Betty said.

24:15.758 --> 24:19.370
John is being transferred
to state prison tonight.

24:19.370 --> 24:21.764
There's no way to get him
out of there.

24:21.764 --> 24:23.940
But the precinct...

24:23.940 --> 24:25.725
Listen to you.

24:25.725 --> 24:28.162
You're talking about breaking
15 different laws.

24:28.162 --> 24:30.512
We need to stop and think.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.515
How do we know this isn't
exactly what the Akrida wants?

24:33.515 --> 24:35.299
To lure us all into their trap

24:35.299 --> 24:37.998
and then take out everyone
all at once?

24:37.998 --> 24:40.391
Why don't we check in
with Latika and Carlos first?

24:40.391 --> 24:42.132
If they have that bracelet,
then at least you'll know

24:42.132 --> 24:44.265
you're punching
the right people.

24:49.096 --> 24:52.447
I'll stake out the precinct,
look for any openings.

24:52.447 --> 24:55.406
You call Carlos and Lata
and meet me there.

24:57.757 --> 24:59.062
Bracelet or not,

24:59.062 --> 25:00.629
I'm breaking down the doors tonight.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.162
What's it gonna be,
Johnny boy?

25:14.121 --> 25:15.775
I'll tell you everything.

25:21.171 --> 25:24.218
So the-the guy in the photo
is, um--

25:24.218 --> 25:26.437
his name is...

25:26.437 --> 25:28.788
Jeff Beck.

25:28.788 --> 25:30.398
Good. Go on.

25:30.398 --> 25:32.574
Uh, w-well, see,
Jeff is, uh...

25:32.574 --> 25:35.316
it's only one of his,
um, aliases.

25:35.316 --> 25:38.885
He also goes by Eric Bloom.

25:38.885 --> 25:41.365
And where do I find Mr. Bloom?
- Actually, no.

25:41.365 --> 25:43.150
You know what?

25:43.150 --> 25:46.022
No, no, no.
Lately, he's been going by, um,

25:46.022 --> 25:48.851
Levon Helm.

25:48.851 --> 25:51.245
Yeah.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.206
I didn't want to believe
the psych eval

25:56.206 --> 25:58.034
in your profile was accurate,

25:58.034 --> 26:00.820
but you really do have
a death wish, don't you?

26:00.820 --> 26:03.170
]

26:04.301 --> 26:06.521
See, when I was in basic,

26:06.521 --> 26:09.437
they told us that
if we ever got captured,

26:09.437 --> 26:14.442
that our only job was
not to tell the enemy anything.

26:14.442 --> 26:18.359
But here you are
telling me everything.

26:18.359 --> 26:20.535
The hell
is that supposed to mean?

26:20.535 --> 26:24.408
It means
that you played your hand.

26:25.801 --> 26:28.543
See, if you're willing
to go through all this

26:28.543 --> 26:30.893
to find him, then, well,

26:30.893 --> 26:34.027
that guy, whoever he is,

26:34.027 --> 26:36.116
is a threat to you.

26:36.116 --> 26:37.726
And your former leader, well,

26:37.726 --> 26:39.728
when she was in control
of Roxy,

26:39.728 --> 26:41.861
she said that nothing
of this Earth can harm you.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.471
So if he's a threat to you,

26:43.471 --> 26:47.475
and nothing of this Earth
can harm you, well...

26:47.475 --> 26:51.653
that would mean
he's not of this Earth.

26:51.653 --> 26:54.830
Which explains why you look
like a scared little baby.

26:58.007 --> 27:01.750
Well, you've, uh...

27:01.750 --> 27:04.971
you've shown your hand too, Winchester.

27:04.971 --> 27:07.277
Because if you don't know anything,

27:07.277 --> 27:10.280
then you're no longer
of any use to us.

27:14.328 --> 27:15.982
It's gonna be a shame

27:15.982 --> 27:19.594
when that prison transport
gets into that car crash,

27:19.594 --> 27:22.510
killing everyone inside.

27:22.510 --> 27:24.207
Hm.

27:34.348 --> 27:35.610
Okay, so--

27:35.610 --> 27:37.656
sorry, let me get these facts
straight, so...

27:39.005 --> 27:42.182
That bracelet made this room.

27:42.182 --> 27:44.967
And this room
was from your childhood.

27:44.967 --> 27:47.317
And all of this is tied

27:47.317 --> 27:50.146
to some sort of
dark secret of yours?

27:53.019 --> 27:56.065
Okay, so spill already
before we turn into popsicles.

27:58.067 --> 28:00.287
I can't, Carlos.

28:00.287 --> 28:03.072
Lata,
you know I am prone

28:03.072 --> 28:05.292
to long, slow-build,
catharsis-driven theater,

28:05.292 --> 28:08.991
but I don't think we have time
for a one-act play here.

28:08.991 --> 28:10.906
Lata...

28:12.734 --> 28:15.824
Whatever it is,
it's going to be okay.

28:30.970 --> 28:35.801
Back at Tracy's farm,
and the story I told...

28:37.063 --> 28:39.848
About how you became
a pacifist?

28:39.848 --> 28:42.982
I didn't tell you
the whole story.

28:42.982 --> 28:46.812
I didn't tell you about Sania,

28:46.812 --> 28:49.205
my family's housekeeper.

28:49.205 --> 28:51.642
She practically raised me.

28:51.642 --> 28:53.166
One night, my father had

28:53.166 --> 28:56.299
some of his
work colleagues over.

28:56.299 --> 28:59.476
He always went all-out
for work dinners.

28:59.476 --> 29:02.479
And there was always
so much food.

29:02.479 --> 29:06.396
So when I noticed
some leftover gulab jamun,

29:06.396 --> 29:09.573
after dessert, I didn't think
anyone would miss it.

29:09.573 --> 29:14.143
So I took the tray
and I came here...

29:14.143 --> 29:17.625
to Sania's quarters
to share with her.

29:17.625 --> 29:20.149
W-what happened?

29:20.149 --> 29:22.325
Well, my father came out
looking for me

29:22.325 --> 29:25.198
and saw what we were eating.

29:25.198 --> 29:27.766
He lit into Sania

29:27.766 --> 29:31.639
for stealing food
made for his guests.

29:31.639 --> 29:33.902
And I tried to tell him
it wasn't her fault.

29:33.902 --> 29:38.124
I really tried to tell him
it wasn't her fault, but...

29:40.300 --> 29:44.739
Things escalated quickly.

29:44.739 --> 29:47.394
He snatched the food
out of Sania's hand

29:47.394 --> 29:49.004
and raised his hand
to strike her,

29:49.004 --> 29:52.181
and I stepped in
and I hit him!

29:54.923 --> 29:57.708
With this very lamp.

29:59.667 --> 30:03.323
I was just so angry
at how he was treating her.

30:03.323 --> 30:05.151
I-I couldn't control it.

30:05.151 --> 30:09.459
Lata,
you didn't do anything wrong.

30:12.941 --> 30:17.554
And-and now, your-your
darkest secret is out, so...

30:17.554 --> 30:20.035
You hear that, shadow folk?

30:20.035 --> 30:22.342
Her secret's out!

30:28.609 --> 30:31.438
Is there more to the story?

30:49.282 --> 30:51.545
Lata, listen to me.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.852
Look, we-we all have secrets.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.245
And they are ours.
But I promise you,

30:56.245 --> 30:58.595
that whatever else
you have to share

30:58.595 --> 31:01.729
stays in this room forever.

31:07.300 --> 31:09.911
He dragged me
back into the house

31:09.911 --> 31:13.132
and told my mother
what happened.

31:13.132 --> 31:14.481
And she said

31:14.481 --> 31:18.702
she was ashamed of me.

31:20.052 --> 31:24.360
Said I was wrong to have
defended Sania over...

31:24.360 --> 31:26.493
Family.

31:26.493 --> 31:29.452
Your mom was wrong.

31:29.452 --> 31:31.150
They sent me back
into my room

31:31.150 --> 31:34.762
and that's when I packed up
everything I could.

31:34.762 --> 31:36.807
I knew there was no reason
for me to stay.

31:36.807 --> 31:40.594
My parents were never gonna
look at me the same way.

31:40.594 --> 31:44.728
So I left
and I never looked back.

31:47.296 --> 31:50.952
I left her.

31:50.952 --> 31:56.175
My father, he blamed Sania
for making me disobedient,

31:56.175 --> 31:58.873
so he locked her in here
without any heat.

32:01.528 --> 32:03.399
And it was...

32:05.967 --> 32:09.318
It was the coldest night
of the year, and...

32:13.888 --> 32:18.501
And Sania froze to death.

32:21.026 --> 32:23.550
And now we're here,

32:23.550 --> 32:27.728
living what I put her through.

32:27.728 --> 32:31.732
And I'm just so sorry, Sania.

32:31.732 --> 32:33.777
Here.

32:35.388 --> 32:38.739
I'm so sorry!

32:40.523 --> 32:41.960
I'm...

33:02.458 --> 33:06.114
Well, I guess the truth
really does set you free.

33:06.114 --> 33:09.117
In more ways than one.

33:11.293 --> 33:14.253
Well, listen, I'd love
to bask in this moment, but--

33:14.253 --> 33:17.778
Oh, thank God.

33:17.778 --> 33:19.693
Are you guys okay?

33:19.693 --> 33:22.087
Why didn't you answer
the phone?

33:22.087 --> 33:25.568
Uh, long story,
uh, with some Toastettes,

33:25.568 --> 33:28.180
but, uh,
it's a happy ending, though.

33:28.180 --> 33:31.009
- We found the bracelet.
- Tell me that it works.

33:32.967 --> 33:36.014
Well, after everything
we just went through,

33:36.014 --> 33:39.191
it better.
- I hope you're right.

33:39.191 --> 33:40.583
Because Mary's gonna need it

33:40.583 --> 33:43.804
if she's gonna bust
John out of jail.

33:43.804 --> 33:45.588
I-I thought they went
to the cabin.

33:45.588 --> 33:47.025
Another long story,

33:47.025 --> 33:48.896
hopefully also
with a happy ending.

33:48.896 --> 33:50.637
Come on.
I'll explain on the way.

33:50.637 --> 33:51.725
Come on.

33:56.208 --> 33:59.602
Ride's here, John.

33:59.602 --> 34:01.213
Oh, before we say
our goodbyes,

34:01.213 --> 34:02.431
I need to tell you
one more thing about

34:02.431 --> 34:04.651
the guy you're looking for.

34:08.655 --> 34:11.310
Whoever he is,

34:11.310 --> 34:13.877
I hope he gives you hell.

34:18.056 --> 34:21.407
Move him out of here.
Get him up!

34:25.193 --> 34:26.934
You got spunk, Winchester.

34:26.934 --> 34:28.370
Dumb as a bag of hair,

34:28.370 --> 34:29.676
but at least
you went down swingin'.

34:29.676 --> 34:30.764
Get him out of here.

34:30.764 --> 34:32.157
Get him moving.

34:40.121 --> 34:42.645
You can't be this crazy.

34:42.645 --> 34:44.517
Did you see
Kyle's autopsy report?

34:44.517 --> 34:47.215
- Actually, I did.
- Walk away then.

34:47.215 --> 34:48.651
That is not happening.

34:52.481 --> 34:54.875
You really want to get
arrested too, don't you?

34:56.529 --> 34:58.879
You have no idea
how much danger John is in.

34:58.879 --> 35:00.533
His problems started
the day he met you.

35:00.533 --> 35:01.708
Ah!

35:05.190 --> 35:06.626
Did you really think
this was gonna end

35:06.626 --> 35:08.541
any other way?
- No.

35:08.541 --> 35:10.630
I just had to keep you
distracted long enough.

35:10.630 --> 35:11.848
Drugs should be legalized.

35:11.848 --> 35:13.415
Oh--don't!

35:15.635 --> 35:18.551
I really hope you don't have
any dark secrets.

35:18.551 --> 35:21.554
- What is this?
- A way to see the truth.

35:21.554 --> 35:24.339
- What are you doing?
- Trying to save my son.

35:24.339 --> 35:26.515
But for that to happen,
we're gonna need your help.

35:26.515 --> 35:27.908
Okay, just take
a look around.

35:27.908 --> 35:30.084
See for yourself.

35:34.044 --> 35:37.526
<i>- Dios mío.</i>
- What is it? What do you see?

35:37.526 --> 35:39.093
I can't believe it.

35:41.530 --> 35:42.879
Johnny.

35:42.879 --> 35:44.316
Where is he
being transferred?

35:44.316 --> 35:48.102
That cop
is his transfer van driver.

35:48.102 --> 35:49.756
No--all right,
I have an idea.

35:49.756 --> 35:51.366
It's-it's basically
just like this,

35:51.366 --> 35:53.803
but just a little more
aggressive and violent.

36:02.377 --> 36:04.945
Let him go!

36:06.164 --> 36:09.384
A rescue. Adorable.

36:11.125 --> 36:13.083
Hey!

36:13.083 --> 36:16.217
That's for Kyle.
That's for my son.

36:16.217 --> 36:18.437
All right.
Yeah, come on.

36:18.437 --> 36:20.090
Thanks.

36:20.090 --> 36:21.570
- Okay. You okay?
- Yeah.

36:21.570 --> 36:22.963
All right.
So what's the plan?

36:22.963 --> 36:24.878
- Run.
- All right. Yeah, come on.

36:24.878 --> 36:26.445
Oh!

36:26.445 --> 36:27.794
Betty.

36:27.794 --> 36:30.188
It's okay.
I'll catch up later.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.885
You need a cop on the inside, right?

36:31.885 --> 36:33.321
John, come on!

36:33.321 --> 36:35.018
Thank you.

36:38.413 --> 36:39.980
Okay.

36:42.809 --> 36:44.245
<i>Besos.</i>

36:53.428 --> 36:55.648
- Thanks.
- So they bought it?

36:55.648 --> 36:57.127
For now, yeah.

36:57.127 --> 36:59.086
Even better,
nobody saw anyone else.

36:59.086 --> 37:01.262
They just think
they got jumped by you.

37:07.921 --> 37:10.271
I'd say thank you for
letting me behind the curtain,

37:10.271 --> 37:12.230
but...

37:12.230 --> 37:16.886
I'm not sure how happy I am to
know about your monster club.

37:16.886 --> 37:18.540
Yeah. I get it.

37:18.540 --> 37:20.238
I've been
a card-carrying member

37:20.238 --> 37:21.717
since I was a little kid.

37:21.717 --> 37:23.676
Kinda wish I didn't know
about it either.

37:25.286 --> 37:29.551
I'm sorry.

37:29.551 --> 37:31.858
Thank you
for helping John out.

37:31.858 --> 37:35.122
Thank you
for looking out for him.

37:35.122 --> 37:36.776
Hey.

37:36.776 --> 37:38.386
Look, I know you're not a fan
of tattoos,

37:38.386 --> 37:41.911
but, um, use this
as soon as you can.

37:41.911 --> 37:42.869
All right?
The marks will protect you

37:42.869 --> 37:44.653
from the Akrida.

37:44.653 --> 37:47.395
At least my mom's not hear
to see this.

37:47.395 --> 37:50.006
Yeah.
Look, um...

37:52.226 --> 37:54.228
Bets, you really
put it all on the line,

37:54.228 --> 37:56.578
so thank you.

37:56.578 --> 37:58.276
Well, sometimes
doing the right thing

37:58.276 --> 37:59.625
means doing the wrong thing.

38:01.888 --> 38:04.760
Okay, then.
We never had this conversation

38:04.760 --> 38:06.849
and I never saw where you went.

38:06.849 --> 38:08.547
Just lay low, okay?

38:08.547 --> 38:10.679
Millie and I will look into
clearing your name.

38:10.679 --> 38:14.248
There has to be a witness--
someone who saw something.

38:14.248 --> 38:15.771
Thank you.

38:15.771 --> 38:17.164
Um, okay.

38:17.164 --> 38:18.905
Take the back roads
out of town.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.646
And, uh,
stay off the interstate

38:20.646 --> 38:22.343
until you're clear
of the county.

38:22.343 --> 38:24.040
Will do.

38:31.134 --> 38:34.094
Okay.

38:34.094 --> 38:35.269
All right.

38:40.274 --> 38:42.189
Carlos...

38:42.189 --> 38:43.321
Yeah?

38:46.236 --> 38:48.326
I don't want a truth bracelet

38:48.326 --> 38:51.546
to be the only reason why
I share things with you.

38:51.546 --> 38:53.156
So...

38:53.156 --> 38:56.943
there's one more thing
you should know.

38:59.162 --> 39:01.426
Okay.

39:01.426 --> 39:04.646
No judgments.

39:04.646 --> 39:06.300
Promise.

39:08.171 --> 39:12.350
My parents aren't dead.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.744
I'm sorry.
I-I only said that

39:15.744 --> 39:18.051
because it was easier
to say that

39:18.051 --> 39:20.532
than to explain what they did.

39:20.532 --> 39:21.924
As far as I'm concerned,

39:21.924 --> 39:26.189
your parents are dead
to me, so...

39:26.189 --> 39:28.061
I still have nothing
but love for you.

39:32.065 --> 39:36.678
Do you think Mary and John

39:36.678 --> 39:38.941
will feel the same way?

39:38.941 --> 39:41.857
It's just I've been lying
to them for so long.

39:48.473 --> 39:52.868
If you need time
to tell them your story,

39:52.868 --> 39:54.348
take it,

39:54.348 --> 39:57.612
because it's your story
to tell.

39:57.612 --> 40:01.050
But I can almost assure you,

40:01.050 --> 40:02.835
they won't love you any less.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.536
Same as me.

40:10.146 --> 40:12.758
Oh, come here. Let me hug you.
- Thank you.

40:25.248 --> 40:28.164
What is it?

40:28.164 --> 40:30.297
Nothin'. I--

40:30.297 --> 40:31.777
I, uh...

40:33.779 --> 40:35.737
I just keep seeing it.

40:35.737 --> 40:38.348
Kyle.

40:38.348 --> 40:41.917
That's not on you.

40:41.917 --> 40:44.180
I know.

40:44.180 --> 40:46.531
I do.

40:49.795 --> 40:53.015
It's hard.

40:53.015 --> 40:55.365
I know.

40:55.365 --> 40:57.455
But the only way
we're gonna make the Akrida pay

40:57.455 --> 40:59.674
for what they did to Kyle

40:59.674 --> 41:02.677
is by finding this guy.
