WEBVTT

00:15.849 --> 00:18.810
It took me a long time
and some hard lessons

00:18.894 --> 00:23.690
to learn what I know
about love, fate, and chasing redemption.

00:23.774 --> 00:27.027
That story saw me beaten, loved,
befriended, and chained

00:27.110 --> 00:28.612
on three continents.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.156
But it started with a simple choice,

00:31.240 --> 00:33.450
escape or die.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.913
Back in here at one o'clock, you bludgers.

00:38.789 --> 00:41.375
Not quarter past after a smoke.
You hear me?

00:41.458 --> 00:43.043
-Yeah, yeah.
-I know.

00:54.346 --> 00:56.807
-Ooh, here he comes.
-Hello, doggy.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.144
You fucking dog!

01:01.979 --> 01:04.313
-You're in trouble now, mate.
-Dead man!

01:05.941 --> 01:07.651
You're gonna get yours, dog.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.698
You're a dead man.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.376
They let Barnes out of the slot.

01:25.085 --> 01:28.255
I know. I just saw him.
I thought he had another month to do.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.090
He's got friends in high places,
hasn't he?

01:31.717 --> 01:32.885
I'm not ready.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.262
Dale, would you just forget
about escaping?

01:35.345 --> 01:37.431
Tell that bloody cop
what he wants to know.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.100
And then what? I'm not a dog, Ned.

01:40.184 --> 01:44.396
Well, every fucking convict out there
already thinks that you are.

01:44.479 --> 01:48.108
Shit, Barnes,
he almost killed you last time, didn't he?

01:50.611 --> 01:53.322
What, you think
he's just gonna not finish the job?

02:00.329 --> 02:03.749
-Fuck it. I'm going now.
-You're what?

02:07.085 --> 02:09.378
Dale! What about me?

02:10.339 --> 02:11.715
You gotta take me with you.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.636
Dale. Dale!

04:21.136 --> 04:24.348
It's nearly one o'clock.
It's never gonna work with these things.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.725
Dale, we've gotta go back.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.602
Dale, listen to me!

04:28.685 --> 04:30.979
We can get back onto the wing
before the next count.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.239
There's a buzz saw downstairs.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.909
-No. They'll know it was missing.
-Or they won't.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.702
Well, they'll bloody well hear it,
won't they?

04:45.786 --> 04:47.538
We'll wait until the work crew come back.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.331
-It won't work.
-It will work.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.543
Because they'd never think a convict
would be stupid enough to use a power saw

04:52.626 --> 04:54.169
to escape over the front wall.

04:54.253 --> 04:57.339
And they'd be bloody well right.
Fuck this, man. We have to go back.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.424
Mate, I can't go back.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.189
-Come on.
-You four.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.565
We need to make a start

05:56.648 --> 05:58.734
and then bring those upstairs,
through into the back.

06:42.945 --> 06:43.904
Fuck it!

06:56.416 --> 06:57.584
Fuck.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.039
Stay tight. They can't see us from here.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.165
Okay.

07:44.715 --> 07:46.049
How high is it?

07:46.133 --> 07:48.594
-Thirty, 40 feet, maybe.
-Uh-huh.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.346
We could bloody break our legs.

07:52.890 --> 07:55.893
-Move.
-Dale, I'm scared of heights.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.769
You're gonna be fine, mate.

08:00.731 --> 08:03.942
You know what? You go, all right?
I'm gonna go back, but you go.

08:04.818 --> 08:08.405
-For fuck's sake. Calm down.
-Just let me go. I can't fucking do this.

08:09.198 --> 08:12.576
You can't go back.
'Cause then they're gonna know I'm gone.

08:13.243 --> 08:17.581
-Yeah--
-Hey, yeah. Mate, you're going first.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.094
Fuck.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.998
In that moment,
I was waiting for the rifle shot.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.877
I didn't dare think I might be free.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.540
The cops been here?

10:24.124 --> 10:25.417
No.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.170
Where did you go before coming here?

10:28.253 --> 10:29.296
I didn't.

10:30.631 --> 10:31.673
Not to your mother?

10:33.759 --> 10:35.427
That's the first place they'd be waiting.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.931
I was the next person you thought of. Why?

10:39.014 --> 10:40.057
I don't know.

10:41.183 --> 10:43.894
I didn't give it much thought.
I just jumped the wall and got away.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.563
I didn't have much of a plan beyond that.

10:46.647 --> 10:50.484
Well, I'm sure you have friends who can be
much more use in your current situation.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.653
Practically, I mean, to a fugitive.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.156
You're not my student anymore, Dale.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.659
And I'm not in the business
of helping escaped convicts.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.160
Sir, I had to escape.

11:00.244 --> 11:03.997
They were gonna kill me in there.
I really didn't have a choice.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.666
Choice is all you have.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.042
That's easy to say.

11:08.585 --> 11:12.005
I mean, I can't go back to college.
I can't be a paramedic.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.758
There's not much left.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.683
I was so proud

11:24.309 --> 11:26.144
of getting out of where I came from,

11:28.272 --> 11:29.982
of how proud my mum was…

11:32.067 --> 11:33.777
proud of what you saw in me.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.780
And now look at me.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.949
I'm a failed student, a failed son…

11:41.201 --> 11:43.328
a failed criminal, failed addict.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.874
You're better than all those things.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.209
No.

11:52.337 --> 11:53.839
No, I know what I did…

11:56.258 --> 11:57.634
what I need to pay for.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.848
Dying in prison
wasn't gonna make it right.

12:02.931 --> 12:07.603
You haven't escaped anything
unless you go on to something, so…

12:10.230 --> 12:11.607
what do you want to be?

12:12.316 --> 12:15.319
I wanna be the man I was gonna be
before all of this.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.322
You can't. Not here. Not anymore.

12:23.702 --> 12:24.995
Then I have to leave.

12:37.508 --> 12:38.509
Why?

12:38.592 --> 12:40.677
Because I know who you really are.

12:41.261 --> 12:44.473
And I think you came here
to have someone remind you of it.

12:49.770 --> 12:50.979
No more guns, Dale.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.316
No more armed robberies or heroin.

12:55.734 --> 12:57.277
Don't you make me into a fool.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.052
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Bombay.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.971
While opening the overhead compartments…

13:24.054 --> 13:25.430
-Go. Go on.
-…please take care.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.812
The first thing I noticed was the smell.

13:32.896 --> 13:35.816
In that first Bombay minute,
I didn't recognize it.

13:35.899 --> 13:39.862
But I do now. It was the smell of hope.

13:39.945 --> 13:41.530
-Next.
-Ladies and gentlemen,

13:41.613 --> 13:43.866
welcome to Bombay International Airport…

13:43.949 --> 13:47.536
But standing there with another man's name
and fake passport,

13:47.619 --> 13:50.873
hope and fear felt much the same.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.078
Good morning, sir!

15:11.161 --> 15:12.871
I am number one guide in Bombay.

15:12.955 --> 15:16.208
I know everything there is to know
about my golden city.

15:16.291 --> 15:19.127
You are in need of assistance?
I can show you everything.

15:20.546 --> 15:23.465
-Hey-- Thank you, but no.
-Sir, let me assist you, sir.

15:24.049 --> 15:25.175
Yes, sir.

15:25.259 --> 15:28.470
But forgive me, sir,
this was only a one-time no, huh?

15:28.554 --> 15:31.598
And here in my India,
a one-time no is not a true no.

15:31.682 --> 15:33.767
Yeah? So what's a true no?

15:34.476 --> 15:37.521
Only after three noes, it is a true no.

15:38.564 --> 15:41.942
Please, sir, allow me
to show you cheap, clean hotel.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.735
And after, you decide what to pay.

15:43.819 --> 15:45.362
What if I decide to pay nothing?

15:45.445 --> 15:47.698
Then that is your choice, sir.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.783
But I don't believe
it's a choice you'll be making.

15:49.867 --> 15:52.202
I am number one guide in Bombay.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.746
Number one pain in the arse.

15:55.747 --> 15:59.334
Yes, sir. Very big, sir. Everyone agrees.
You are knowing me too well.

15:59.418 --> 16:01.837
-You want to see our merch?
-No.

16:02.671 --> 16:03.797
Sir.

16:04.673 --> 16:05.674
Myself, Prabhu.

16:07.885 --> 16:08.886
Lindsay.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.637
-Lin-see.
-Lindsay.

16:10.721 --> 16:12.973
Lin-see. Sir, don't mind, huh?

16:13.056 --> 16:15.893
But… this is a not-so-good name.

16:17.269 --> 16:18.645
-No. No, thank you.
-No?

16:20.189 --> 16:24.026
It is too long and squeaky
for how Indian people speak.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.111
-Okay.
-I think short name, short name.

16:26.195 --> 16:27.988
-That's--
-"Lin" is better.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.616
-Yeah, no problem.
-You do not object? I can call you Lin?

16:30.699 --> 16:32.075
-Lin's fine.
-Very good.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.827
Also, it has a very lucky meaning.

16:33.911 --> 16:36.121
-Oh, yeah? What's that?
-"Great penis."

16:37.873 --> 16:39.082
Great penis?

16:39.166 --> 16:41.793
It is not meaning this exactly,
but it is sounding like ling,

16:41.877 --> 16:43.712
and that is meaning, "great big penis."

16:44.296 --> 16:45.506
-Watch out.
-No, no, no.

16:45.589 --> 16:46.840
I'm telling you,

16:48.300 --> 16:51.053
it is full power name, too lucky name.

16:51.136 --> 16:54.556
Everyone will love this name
when they hear it. You'll see.

17:00.771 --> 17:01.855
Okay, you win.

17:03.357 --> 17:04.566
Show me a hotel.

17:08.278 --> 17:09.363
Sir, come, sir.

17:16.662 --> 17:17.954
You like?

17:27.047 --> 17:28.048
I like.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.386
Where are you coming from?

17:35.681 --> 17:36.807
New Zealand.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.346
You studied philosophy?

18:18.182 --> 18:19.641
How's that working for you?

18:21.185 --> 18:24.313
That why we're here, to debate philosophy?

18:25.522 --> 18:27.858
What, you think you're too clever for me,
do you, Dale?

18:27.941 --> 18:29.985
I'm just a dumb policeman.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.779
But years of experience
has given me a philosophy

18:33.405 --> 18:36.825
based on, you know, empiric research

18:37.409 --> 18:42.497
that, just like day follows night,
every man succumbs to his nature,

18:43.165 --> 18:44.791
even a smart boy like you.

18:45.584 --> 18:47.002
You think your mother's proud?

18:47.085 --> 18:50.088
I was watching her in the courtroom,
blaming herself.

18:51.006 --> 18:54.009
-Well, you broke her heart.
-Don't talk about her.

18:54.635 --> 18:58.639
You know why you are worse
than all the scumbags in here?

18:59.431 --> 19:01.642
Because you had
the chance to be different.

19:02.226 --> 19:06.522
All the advantages she worked so hard
to give you, and yet here you are.

19:06.605 --> 19:09.149
And a good man is dead.

19:09.233 --> 19:11.068
Who killed Officer Floris?

19:11.902 --> 19:13.487
Give me the name.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.281
Come on, mate.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.663
I can't remember.

19:27.501 --> 19:28.544
You will.

19:47.062 --> 19:50.607
Wake up, Linbaba!
I have so much to show you.

19:52.317 --> 19:53.819
I charge 100 rupees a day.

19:53.902 --> 19:57.239
For this, I will show you everything.

19:57.322 --> 19:58.448
Tourist pay for taxi.

20:01.201 --> 20:04.162
Should we take this
white motherfucker the long way round?

20:11.044 --> 20:12.254
Chai also.

20:12.337 --> 20:13.338
I pay?

20:14.464 --> 20:16.550
How long
has this motherfucker been in town?

20:17.718 --> 20:19.219
What is this "maderchod"?

20:19.303 --> 20:20.345
"Motherfucker."

20:20.429 --> 20:22.931
Very good curse, Linbaba.
Everyone is using it.

20:23.015 --> 20:24.558
"Bhenchod" also. Sisterfucker.

20:24.641 --> 20:25.726
Sisterfucker?

20:30.814 --> 20:31.815
Bloody hell!

20:33.567 --> 20:34.735
Is he fucking mad?

20:42.492 --> 20:43.952
And if we stop for lunch…

20:45.078 --> 20:47.748
How much do you charge
this white motherfucker?

20:47.831 --> 20:49.416
Who are you calling "motherfucker"?

21:12.981 --> 21:15.734
I was a wanted man
with a price on my head,

21:15.817 --> 21:18.320
on the run with no home and no country.

21:19.363 --> 21:21.031
But for now, I was free.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.243
Every day on the run is your whole life.

21:24.910 --> 21:26.995
And there's hope and excitement
in the new.

21:27.079 --> 21:28.455
I don't really need any fabric.

21:28.539 --> 21:31.583
You know, I'll come back maybe tomorrow.
Tomorrow. Tomorrow.

21:31.667 --> 21:34.378
-You're going to come back here.
-Thank you.

21:56.275 --> 21:57.109
Look out!

21:59.987 --> 22:01.405
You're lucky I was here.

22:05.284 --> 22:07.202
Maybe you're my guardian angel.

22:07.995 --> 22:09.746
No. Definitely not.

22:09.830 --> 22:11.623
There's too much devil in me for that.

22:12.332 --> 22:15.335
-How much devil are we talking?
-Hey, Karla! Come on.

22:15.961 --> 22:18.881
If you come to Reynaldo's sometime,
maybe you'll get to find out.

22:22.718 --> 22:23.719
Karla!

22:26.096 --> 22:28.432
-Who is this?
-You made a new friend?

22:36.356 --> 22:39.902
You found it then. I'm Karla Saaranen.

22:40.694 --> 22:43.322
Lindsay Ford. People call me Lin.

22:44.072 --> 22:45.490
They do?

22:45.574 --> 22:47.826
Yeah, I'm aware of
the whole "great penis" thing.

22:47.910 --> 22:49.411
Just "penis," no "great."

22:49.494 --> 22:52.706
Just means, you know, everyday,
average, kind of…

22:54.499 --> 22:55.959
All right.

22:56.043 --> 22:59.213
Beware her riddles
and her seductions, young man.

23:00.672 --> 23:02.549
-Didier Levy.
-Lindsay Ford.

23:06.512 --> 23:08.388
-Were you leaving?
-Yeah? Just got here.

23:08.472 --> 23:11.433
Then why on earth are we standing?

23:11.517 --> 23:12.809
Come. Join us.

23:13.352 --> 23:15.395
You can stand to eat a meal if you must.

23:15.479 --> 23:20.192
You can stand to make love if you're able,
but it's impossible to stand and drink.

23:20.275 --> 23:22.569
It's the act of a barbarian,

23:22.653 --> 23:25.656
an animal at the watering hole.

23:27.491 --> 23:28.617
Whiskey…

23:29.576 --> 23:30.577
The same.

23:30.661 --> 23:33.497
Reynaldo's was an unofficial free zone,

23:33.997 --> 23:36.875
scrupulously ignored by the local police.

23:38.544 --> 23:40.754
Didier was a permanent fixture,

23:40.838 --> 23:44.550
putting together buyers and sellers of
anything that could earn him a commission.

23:45.175 --> 23:48.303
But strict rules apply to
all the business conducted there.

23:48.887 --> 23:52.683
Deals for drugs and contraband
were openly transacted at the tables,

23:53.267 --> 23:56.520
but these agreements could only be sealed
on the pavement outside.

23:57.980 --> 24:00.607
Hookers, dealers, gamblers and gangsters.

24:01.108 --> 24:04.111
Men who might kill each other any day
and knew it.

24:04.194 --> 24:07.698
But, in Reynaldo's,
no blood was ever spilt.

24:10.117 --> 24:12.661
Dangerous man, that one. Rafiq.

24:12.744 --> 24:14.538
He used to run a black market in books.

24:15.414 --> 24:17.583
-Books?
-Passports.

24:17.666 --> 24:20.043
Rafiq is bitter
about losing his book business.

24:20.127 --> 24:21.420
Men were killed.

24:24.882 --> 24:27.259
-What about that guy?
-The victor.

24:27.342 --> 24:28.802
Abdullah Taheri.

24:29.303 --> 24:33.557
He works for Abdel Khader Khan,
one of the great crime lords of the city.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.309
Didier, you talk too much.

24:48.822 --> 24:53.202
What, are you expecting
many serious injuries here in Bombay,

24:53.285 --> 24:54.494
huh, Linbaba?

24:55.370 --> 24:58.207
Force of habit. I was an ambo back home.

24:58.874 --> 25:01.168
-Ambo?
-I drove an ambulance.

25:02.753 --> 25:04.838
Better we pretend you're a doctor.

25:05.631 --> 25:07.591
We could be making
so much money like this.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.177
Many patients I could bring you
for a small commission.

25:10.260 --> 25:11.929
Better we don't mention it at all.

25:27.653 --> 25:31.365
Very cool, these sunglasses.
Like Amitabh in Trishul.

25:31.448 --> 25:32.533
Don't do that.

25:32.616 --> 25:33.951
It's style, boss.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.036
Do you wanna swap?

25:37.663 --> 25:38.789
Do you wanna swap?

25:42.251 --> 25:47.005
But-- In all honesty,
these are cheap and not so good.

25:48.340 --> 25:49.925
Do you want them or not?

25:52.177 --> 25:53.554
Why you do this?

25:54.096 --> 25:55.264
Because you're my mate.

26:02.980 --> 26:04.815
-What?
-I walked here barefoot

26:04.898 --> 26:06.441
'cause a guy came in my shoes.

26:07.109 --> 26:09.403
He looked totally straight,
then I went into the bathroom.

26:09.486 --> 26:11.613
When I came out,
he was there with his cock in his hands,

26:11.697 --> 26:13.240
splashing his junk in my shoes.

26:13.323 --> 26:14.449
Oh, my God.

26:14.533 --> 26:15.534
Ugh, Lisa.

26:17.536 --> 26:18.537
I liked those shoes.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.163
-Poor darling.
-How do I wear them now?

26:22.249 --> 26:24.293
Lisa was an old friend of Karla's.

26:24.918 --> 26:28.130
Somehow sad and sexy as hell
all at the same time.

26:28.213 --> 26:29.464
Crazy people love me.

26:30.174 --> 26:32.134
No, they pay to love you.
That's different.

26:32.217 --> 26:33.886
Have I told you to get fucked yet, Didier?

26:33.969 --> 26:36.054
No, but I forgive you for the lapse.

26:36.138 --> 26:40.684
Between us, Lisa, darling, such things
are always implied and understood.

26:41.643 --> 26:44.271
You should do an interview, Lisa.
Anonymous, of course.

26:44.354 --> 26:47.733
-Yes.
-People will be fascinated by your story.

26:47.816 --> 26:50.235
They will be fascinated
by the man who came in her shoes?

26:50.319 --> 26:52.738
-Yeah.
-Who would read this, Kavvie?

26:53.488 --> 26:56.200
Vikram Khanna was a Bollywood stuntman.

26:56.283 --> 26:58.243
His sister Kavita was a journalist.

26:58.327 --> 27:01.538
Smart and ambitious
and eager to make her mark.

27:02.456 --> 27:04.082
What brings you to Bombay, Lin?

27:06.084 --> 27:07.419
Tell her nothing, Lin.

27:07.503 --> 27:10.130
In Bombay,
everyone's story is their own to keep,

27:10.214 --> 27:11.840
which drives Kavvie crazy.

27:12.424 --> 27:14.259
Arre, that's true. That's true.

27:15.052 --> 27:16.386
Maurizio.

27:16.470 --> 27:20.224
Wherever Lisa went, her pimps
Maurizio and Modena

27:20.307 --> 27:22.809
-were never far away.
-This is Lin. He's from New Zealand.

27:22.893 --> 27:25.020
Lin, Maurizio and Modena.

27:25.646 --> 27:26.647
Lin.

27:28.190 --> 27:30.609
Means "prick" in Hindi, right?

27:31.318 --> 27:33.362
He looks like a prick to me.

27:34.530 --> 27:38.700
It takes a prick to know one.

27:39.326 --> 27:41.286
My grandmother was from Padova.

27:42.454 --> 27:43.747
Wow!

27:45.874 --> 27:49.253
Any other languages we should know about,
just to avoid further embarrassment?

27:49.336 --> 27:52.047
I swear pretty good
in Marathi and Hindi these days.

27:52.965 --> 27:57.261
I can even speak fluent American
if the occasion demands.

27:57.344 --> 28:00.222
It's pretty good. Do some more.

28:01.306 --> 28:03.517
"Well, I'm not asking you to forgive me.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.727
I'll never understand or forgive myself.

28:05.811 --> 28:09.648
And if a bullet gets me, so help me,
I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot.

28:09.731 --> 28:14.778
But there's one thing I do know.
That is that I love you, Scarlett."

28:14.862 --> 28:16.655
Wow.

28:17.906 --> 28:21.493
-Arre, do Clint Eastwood. Can you?
-Yeah. Yeah.

28:22.077 --> 28:24.913
"Well, you gotta ask yourself
one question.

28:24.997 --> 28:26.331
'Do I feel lucky?'

28:27.124 --> 28:29.001
Well, do you, punk?"

28:30.878 --> 28:33.380
-What is--
-It's Dirty Harry.

28:34.339 --> 28:37.301
-Is that a Western?
-You don't know Dirty Harry?

28:37.384 --> 28:39.344
Dirty Harry! You don't know Dirty Harry?

28:39.428 --> 28:41.305
Is that Clint?
If it's not a Western, I'm not seeing it.

28:41.388 --> 28:43.182
You should be an actor or something, Lin.

28:43.765 --> 28:45.350
And we should have dinner sometime.

28:45.434 --> 28:48.103
You can talk American to me all night.
I'd like that.

28:48.604 --> 28:49.688
Bye, bye, bye.

28:50.355 --> 28:52.149
-Ciao, Maurizio.
-Ciao.

28:52.232 --> 28:54.693
-Nice, nice. Ciao, Maurizio.
-Bye.

28:56.653 --> 28:58.197
-He's angry, man.
-He's like--

28:58.280 --> 29:00.991
-He didn't look happy, yaar.
-I think you embarrassed him good.

29:13.045 --> 29:17.466
Those first few weeks, I watched
all of the seekers come and then leave,

29:17.549 --> 29:19.134
heading for the "real India,"

29:19.218 --> 29:23.180
seeking enlightenment and solitude
and self-contemplation.

29:24.014 --> 29:25.974
But I'd had my share of that forced on me.

29:29.144 --> 29:32.314
Instead, Bombay felt exhilaratingly free,

29:32.397 --> 29:34.316
a place where everyone started new.

29:34.900 --> 29:37.361
And I responded to that with all my heart.

29:38.612 --> 29:40.113
You should get out of Bombay, Lin.

29:40.948 --> 29:44.243
This is the place they were thinking about
when they invented the word "the pits."

29:45.160 --> 29:47.204
You should go to Varanasi or Rajasthan.

29:47.287 --> 29:49.498
I don't know. I like it here.

29:49.581 --> 29:53.710
And perhaps Bombay offers our Lin
things he won't find anywhere else.

29:54.294 --> 29:55.546
N'est-ce pas?

30:06.557 --> 30:08.600
Can you give this to Karla for me?

30:08.684 --> 30:11.687
Tell her I said not to worry.
I'm a big girl.

30:14.690 --> 30:17.609
-Ciao, Didier. Lin.
-Maurizio.

30:17.693 --> 30:20.112
Andiamo. We don't want
to keep Madame Zhou waiting.

30:29.830 --> 30:31.248
What was that all about?

30:32.791 --> 30:34.960
In matters of food, I am French.

30:35.043 --> 30:36.837
In matters of love, I am Italian.

30:36.920 --> 30:40.257
But in matters of business, I am Swiss,

30:40.340 --> 30:44.261
strictly neutral,
especially with other people's business.

30:44.344 --> 30:45.804
And I advise you to be the same.

30:52.352 --> 30:54.229
Now, if you'll excuse me,

30:54.313 --> 30:58.066
I see a man who might be
of great consequence to my fortunes.

30:58.150 --> 30:59.860
Bonne chance, Lin.

31:04.531 --> 31:08.035
-Something I said?
-No, he's just got business to attend to.

31:09.786 --> 31:13.290
-Looked like your meeting went well?
-It did, actually. Very well.

31:14.875 --> 31:17.628
You just missed Lisa.
She gave me something for you.

31:18.253 --> 31:19.505
Walk with me?

31:36.021 --> 31:38.690
I like that you haven't asked
what this is for.

31:39.900 --> 31:41.401
None of my business.

31:41.485 --> 31:43.904
Yet here you are. How come?

31:46.406 --> 31:48.909
Lisa asked. I like her.

31:50.911 --> 31:54.081
Well, Lisa would spend all her money
on dope if I let her.

31:54.831 --> 31:57.751
I told her she needs to save some
in case she ever needs it.

31:57.835 --> 31:59.294
I hold it for her.

31:59.378 --> 32:01.296
-"Fuck you money."
-Exactly.

32:02.130 --> 32:03.340
She'll never use it.

32:04.466 --> 32:09.012
Even more than the heroin,
Lisa needs to feel looked after,

32:09.596 --> 32:12.558
even if it's by men like Maurizio
who get her into trouble.

32:13.308 --> 32:14.852
Maybe she'll surprise you one day.

32:15.894 --> 32:18.605
I doubt it. She is what she is.

32:21.775 --> 32:23.402
You don't think people can change?

32:26.488 --> 32:27.698
They have to want to.

32:29.616 --> 32:32.995
I think life's like a crowded lifeboat.

32:34.037 --> 32:36.456
Maybe you throw out your pride
to stay afloat,

32:37.583 --> 32:39.710
maybe your self-respect
and your independence.

32:39.793 --> 32:43.213
And then, you start throwing people out,

32:43.839 --> 32:46.842
friends, everyone you used to know,
and it's still not enough.

32:48.468 --> 32:51.471
The boat is still sinking,
and you're going down with it.

32:51.555 --> 32:53.765
That's Lisa.
She'll never get out of the boat.

33:02.232 --> 33:03.859
You're a good listener.

33:04.568 --> 33:07.362
That's dangerous
because it's so hard to resist.

33:07.446 --> 33:08.572
Being listened to--

33:09.198 --> 33:10.991
really listened to--

33:11.992 --> 33:13.035
it's rare.

33:13.702 --> 33:15.329
Makes a person feel special.

33:23.629 --> 33:27.216
Okay, now you're taking
this good-listener thing a little too far.

33:29.009 --> 33:30.719
What do you do here in Bombay?

33:33.722 --> 33:37.184
For a while, I worked as a translator…

33:38.602 --> 33:41.188
…for business interests
from the West and here in Bombay.

33:41.980 --> 33:44.608
And then I realized
if I was the one making the deals happen,

33:44.691 --> 33:46.193
why not make them happen myself.

33:47.027 --> 33:50.280
Bombay is changing fast.
There's a lot of money to be made here.

33:51.490 --> 33:52.908
Is money what you want?

33:52.991 --> 33:55.827
What I want is to be master
of my own destiny.

33:56.662 --> 33:58.455
Money gives you that freedom.

34:02.417 --> 34:03.919
Have I disappointed you, Lin?

34:06.213 --> 34:08.257
No. No, not at all.

34:10.425 --> 34:13.929
I think freedom is all you can ask for,
however you find it.

34:16.098 --> 34:18.225
What does your freedom look like?

34:21.687 --> 34:24.857
To be able to choose where to be,
what to do…

34:26.984 --> 34:28.068
with who.

34:29.862 --> 34:31.029
Then I'm honored.

34:37.619 --> 34:38.704
This is me.

34:42.291 --> 34:45.252
I'm sorry to have kept you so late.

34:45.335 --> 34:46.920
You should grab a taxi. I'll pay.

34:47.963 --> 34:51.425
I'll walk.
Good way to get to know the city.

34:52.176 --> 34:53.510
You sure?

34:55.596 --> 35:01.560
Then thank you,
for this and for walking with me.

35:02.477 --> 35:03.604
I enjoyed it.

35:04.897 --> 35:05.981
Yeah, me too.

35:24.833 --> 35:26.043
Fuck.

35:52.694 --> 35:53.862
Stop right there!

35:54.446 --> 35:56.323
-Come here.
-Hey!

35:58.242 --> 35:59.409
Where are you going?

36:02.037 --> 36:05.624
Nowhere. Just a tourist.
I got a little bit turned around.

36:05.707 --> 36:07.835
Hey, it's past curfew.

36:08.961 --> 36:10.629
There's a curfew?

36:10.712 --> 36:12.548
Show us your papers.

36:12.631 --> 36:14.174
Show your passport.

36:33.360 --> 36:36.697
Look, breaking curfew, very bad.

36:38.073 --> 36:39.741
-I think you should go to jail.
-Come--

36:39.825 --> 36:41.910
Hey! Would you like to go to jail, gora?

36:44.246 --> 36:45.247
No.

36:46.164 --> 36:48.792
I think you would not like
to go to jail at all, Mr…

38:33.188 --> 38:34.898
Listen, I'm leaving Bombay.

38:36.692 --> 38:37.860
It's time I moved on.

38:39.403 --> 38:40.445
Where?

38:40.988 --> 38:43.740
I don't know. Goa maybe? Varanasi?

38:43.824 --> 38:45.868
-When?
-Tomorrow. This'll be our last day.

38:45.951 --> 38:50.080
Yeah, yeah. These places all the goras
are going to, I don't think you'll like.

38:50.163 --> 38:52.499
-Can't stay here forever.
-No, I know this.

38:53.083 --> 38:55.085
But you should go
to a real Indian village, na?

38:56.003 --> 38:57.004
Listen.

38:57.546 --> 38:58.797
I'm listening.

38:58.881 --> 39:02.801
If you are wanting,
I could take some time from my schedule

39:03.343 --> 39:04.761
and take you to my village.

39:06.096 --> 39:09.391
I've never offered to take a gora before,
but you are my good friend.

39:13.687 --> 39:15.063
How far is it?

39:15.647 --> 39:18.233
One train, two bus rides.
It is beautiful there.

39:19.484 --> 39:20.861
You'll come, na?

39:23.739 --> 39:24.907
I would be honored.

39:26.283 --> 39:28.368
And I will charge
same as Bombay only, huh?

39:28.452 --> 39:29.745
One hundred rupees a day.

39:31.705 --> 39:33.373
I assume I'm buying the train tickets?

39:33.457 --> 39:37.586
Hey, very generous of you to offer, Lin.
I accept.

39:45.469 --> 39:47.095
-Who is it?
-Karla.

40:06.031 --> 40:07.282
Laundry day?

40:08.158 --> 40:09.159
Yep.

40:10.744 --> 40:12.162
I'm leaving town.

40:13.205 --> 40:14.581
Were you gonna say goodbye?

40:16.291 --> 40:18.377
Yeah, I was gonna
come by Reynaldo's tonight.

40:21.713 --> 40:22.714
Come in.

40:25.676 --> 40:26.927
These are quite something.

40:28.971 --> 40:31.306
Yeah. Tough paper round.

40:33.475 --> 40:34.518
What's going on?

40:36.395 --> 40:38.939
I was hoping you'd maybe help me
with something.

40:40.607 --> 40:41.608
Okay.

40:43.819 --> 40:46.321
Lisa's in a really bad situation.

40:46.405 --> 40:49.783
Maurizio convinced her
to work in a brothel called the Palace.

40:50.951 --> 40:53.912
It isn't good. It caters for all tastes.

40:53.996 --> 40:57.624
And Madame Zhou, the woman
who runs the place, is pretty scary.

40:59.376 --> 41:00.711
What about Maurizio?

41:01.628 --> 41:04.173
Maurizio doesn't give a shit
about anyone but himself.

41:05.549 --> 41:10.637
Parker was coming with me to demand
Lisa's release as an American citizen.

41:12.431 --> 41:16.268
Madame Zhou is powerful, but does not want
trouble with the American Embassy.

41:17.936 --> 41:19.229
Sounds like a good plan.

41:19.313 --> 41:22.149
It was, until Parker left town.

41:27.487 --> 41:30.240
I can't stand the idea
of Lisa being prisoner in that place.

41:31.491 --> 41:35.829
And then I thought of you
doing your accents the other day.

41:35.913 --> 41:37.623
Lisa said you were pretty good.

41:38.665 --> 41:40.667
And you thought
I could pretend to be this guy?

41:41.293 --> 41:42.503
Yeah.

41:44.796 --> 41:49.009
I-- Look, Karla, I'm sorry, but… I can't.

41:49.760 --> 41:50.761
You could.

41:51.595 --> 41:54.431
I mean, you're not just some tourist
out to see the world, Lin,

41:54.515 --> 41:55.974
or I wouldn't be here.

41:57.017 --> 41:58.852
Maybe that's why I can't get involved.

42:00.562 --> 42:02.648
Everyone here is running away
from something.

42:02.731 --> 42:04.942
Yeah, I know.
And I plan to keep right on going.

42:05.025 --> 42:09.446
It doesn't work. Trust me.
You can be free of anything but yourself.

42:11.448 --> 42:13.033
You don't know anything about me.

42:15.452 --> 42:17.621
But I thought
there was something worth knowing.

42:18.163 --> 42:19.289
Guess I was wrong.

42:35.389 --> 42:37.391
One way or another,
you're gonna say the words.

42:37.474 --> 42:38.934
So let's just get to it, huh?

42:39.518 --> 42:42.354
Who pulled the trigger?

42:43.063 --> 42:44.523
I'm not a dog.

42:45.315 --> 42:47.568
I'm here to be punished for what I did.

42:47.651 --> 42:51.154
No. Doesn't fucking work like that.

42:51.238 --> 42:52.990
You don't get to feel better.

42:53.574 --> 42:55.951
Punishment is punishment. Pain is pain.

42:58.954 --> 43:00.038
Fuck!

43:00.622 --> 43:03.166
This isn't a path to a better place, kid.

43:03.250 --> 43:04.751
This is all you've got coming.

43:05.419 --> 43:07.546
There's no redemption
for the likes of you.

43:26.190 --> 43:28.859
Don't you knock? Even just once?

43:30.027 --> 43:32.321
We must go and collect
our train tickets for tomorrow now.

43:32.404 --> 43:34.323
This way, no last-minute problems.

43:34.406 --> 43:38.076
Also, we must buy gifts
for everyone in my village.

43:38.160 --> 43:39.161
Everyone?

43:42.372 --> 43:44.750
Help me! Help me!

43:45.959 --> 43:46.960
Call an ambulance!

43:47.836 --> 43:48.837
I'm gonna go get some help.

43:48.921 --> 43:51.131
This is not our business, Lin.
Let's go. Lin!

43:51.215 --> 43:53.800
-Please. Help me.
-Let me see. Let me see.

43:53.884 --> 43:55.427
-When was the last time he shot?
-He's dying!

43:55.511 --> 43:56.887
-When was the last time?
-I don't know.

43:56.970 --> 43:58.764
-Give me some room.
-Somebody call the police.

43:58.847 --> 44:00.974
Lin, this is not our problem.
It is very bad business.

44:01.058 --> 44:03.227
-When did he last shoot?
-It is best we are not involved!

44:03.310 --> 44:05.479
-Lin, let's go!
-An hour? I don't know.

44:07.731 --> 44:09.316
Lin, the police are coming!

44:09.399 --> 44:12.528
-We have to go! They'll arrest us all!
-Please. Please!

44:12.611 --> 44:15.906
-Chalo! Chalo. Down the stairs.
-Please! Don't go! He's dead!

44:15.989 --> 44:20.244
No! Come back! Come back!

44:27.376 --> 44:28.836
You know, I could've saved him.

44:30.504 --> 44:32.297
I've treated overdoses before.

44:32.381 --> 44:33.882
Where are you taking him?

44:33.966 --> 44:36.385
I don't know, Linbaba.
He was looking pretty dead to me.

44:36.885 --> 44:38.428
I could have fucking tried.

44:39.429 --> 44:40.973
It's nothing to do with me.

44:41.932 --> 44:43.934
It's better not to get involved.

44:44.017 --> 44:46.478
-You have to come with us now.
-I don't wanna come with you.

44:46.562 --> 44:47.688
What's the point, Prabhu,

44:49.523 --> 44:52.276
being here, of any of it,
if all I am is scared?

44:56.697 --> 44:58.448
What is it that you are scared of, Lin?

45:10.294 --> 45:11.670
I gotta do something.

45:11.753 --> 45:13.714
Hey, Lin,
we are leaving tomorrow early, yaar.

45:17.092 --> 45:20.012
Look, go get the train tickets.

45:20.095 --> 45:22.472
I'll be back here tomorrow.
We'll leave as planned.

45:24.683 --> 45:26.185
Right now, I gotta be somewhere.

45:32.399 --> 45:34.818
-Who is it?
-It's me. Lin.

45:40.240 --> 45:42.367
-I'll do it.
-What?

45:42.951 --> 45:43.952
Lisa.

45:46.872 --> 45:48.540
If we can go tonight, I'll do it.

45:48.624 --> 45:50.959
Either way, I'm leaving Bombay
first thing tomorrow morning.

45:52.085 --> 45:53.212
What changed?

45:53.837 --> 45:56.798
Guess I need to be running
towards something, not away from it.

45:58.717 --> 45:59.927
Come here.

46:10.562 --> 46:11.730
Choose something smart.

46:13.190 --> 46:15.275
You've got a lot of men's clothes.

46:15.359 --> 46:17.611
The last two guys
who lived here left suddenly.

46:18.737 --> 46:20.364
And didn't take their gear?

46:20.447 --> 46:23.158
One of them was breaking the law.
He had to leave in a hurry.

46:26.828 --> 46:28.288
I'll leave you to it.

46:38.715 --> 46:39.800
Fits you well.

46:41.885 --> 46:44.054
So what happened
to the other guy who lived here?

46:45.264 --> 46:46.265
He died.

46:48.058 --> 46:50.185
Whose suit is this?
The bad guy, or the dead guy?

46:50.686 --> 46:54.064
I bought it for Ahmed to be buried in.
In the end, we didn't use it.

46:54.147 --> 46:55.607
Fuck me, Karla.

46:55.691 --> 46:59.111
Don't tell me you're superstitious.
A man like you?

47:00.529 --> 47:02.614
What does that mean? A man like me?

47:04.157 --> 47:06.869
I don't know. Isn't that the point?

47:13.584 --> 47:14.960
Who do you report to?

47:17.171 --> 47:20.174
Counselor for Political Affairs,
Arlen Hayes.

47:20.257 --> 47:21.466
Your hometown?

47:21.550 --> 47:23.177
Lincoln, Nebraska.

47:23.260 --> 47:24.553
The Deputy Chief of Mission?

47:28.765 --> 47:30.225
Donald-- Donald Gable.

47:43.864 --> 47:47.659
Rumor is, Zhou is the former mistress
of a KGB officer.

47:47.743 --> 47:49.953
But people say
a lot of weird stuff about her.

47:51.163 --> 47:55.501
Bottom line, she is smart,
vindictive and dangerous.

47:56.460 --> 47:59.546
Lisa wouldn't be the first girl
to disappear from the Palace.

48:19.650 --> 48:21.610
How do you know so much about her?

48:22.319 --> 48:25.531
I get paid to make deals happen.
Some of them happened here.

48:31.662 --> 48:33.080
Fuck me.

48:51.682 --> 48:52.975
Ram ram, Miss Karla.

48:53.559 --> 48:54.560
Padma.

48:55.853 --> 48:57.604
Sir, if you please, your business card.

49:02.818 --> 49:05.696
Mr. Parker. Karla knows the way.

49:24.590 --> 49:25.632
Ready?

49:45.194 --> 49:46.904
Is this your American?

49:50.032 --> 49:53.160
Gilbert Parker, with the American Embassy.

49:54.119 --> 49:58.248
This is not an official visit.
At least not this time, anyway.

49:59.082 --> 50:01.585
-You are here doing a favor?
-Yes.

50:03.003 --> 50:05.255
-For you.
-I don't think so.

50:06.089 --> 50:07.591
Are you in love, Mr. Parker?

50:08.884 --> 50:11.553
-What?
-I fear you are in love with our Karla.

50:12.638 --> 50:15.766
Is that how she got you to do
this little job of work for her?

50:18.685 --> 50:23.065
I'm here because I was told an American
citizen is being held against her will.

50:23.148 --> 50:26.818
Don't think for a minute
that Karla will ever love you in return.

50:27.569 --> 50:32.074
I tell you this, Mr. Parker,
as my favor to you.

50:34.117 --> 50:38.455
Duly noted. Now, where's Lisa Carter?

50:38.997 --> 50:40.832
Lisa is where she is happy to be.

50:41.542 --> 50:44.878
Well, then bring her out
and let her tell me that herself.

50:48.048 --> 50:49.633
I don't think so.

50:53.637 --> 50:55.722
Let's go. This is a waste of time.

51:00.143 --> 51:01.186
Karla.

51:04.606 --> 51:08.193
Your business is with me, not her.

51:09.236 --> 51:12.030
You don't look or talk
much like a diplomat.

51:13.991 --> 51:18.203
No. No, I work out of the embassy.

51:19.162 --> 51:20.747
Nobody said I was a diplomat.

51:21.748 --> 51:25.169
My department tends to be
a little more hands-on.

51:25.752 --> 51:26.795
Parker.

51:29.006 --> 51:31.091
So you should get me Lisa Carter.

51:32.551 --> 51:34.928
Because if you fuck with me
for one minute longer,

51:35.012 --> 51:37.055
I will have agents camped
on your doorstep,

51:37.139 --> 51:40.142
taking photographs
of anyone coming in or out.

51:41.351 --> 51:44.855
And I'll make it clear
to the authorities here in Bombay

51:44.938 --> 51:49.985
that the Palace and the US government
are now at war.

51:55.073 --> 51:57.910
Quite the dog you bring in here
on a leash, Karla.

51:59.828 --> 52:01.705
Is this about Ahmed and Christina?

52:03.332 --> 52:07.586
Nothing you do will change
the fact they are gone.

52:13.008 --> 52:17.429
If I walk out of here alone,
there's no going back.

52:29.608 --> 52:30.859
All right.

52:31.818 --> 52:34.863
I agree to your terms, Mr. Parker.

52:34.947 --> 52:36.615
You can take Lisa with you.

52:37.616 --> 52:42.120
I just wonder if Karla will keep her end
of whatever bargain you made.

53:07.271 --> 53:08.689
She's really letting me go?

53:09.439 --> 53:12.651
Mr. Parker here and Madame Zhou
came to an agreement.

53:14.820 --> 53:16.905
Then I guess
I should be thanking Mr. Parker.

53:18.866 --> 53:21.410
Let's get the fuck out of here
before she changes her mind.

53:30.252 --> 53:32.921
What the hell were you thinking,
going after her like that?

53:33.005 --> 53:34.673
You wanted her out, she's out.

53:34.756 --> 53:36.383
I wasn't gonna leave her behind.

53:47.477 --> 53:48.812
I need a fix, Karla.

53:49.521 --> 53:51.899
Zhou cut me off
unless I told you I wanted to stay.

53:52.482 --> 53:55.027
But I knew once you got my message,
you'd come running.

53:55.569 --> 53:56.570
Come here.

54:03.076 --> 54:04.369
I'm ready.

54:05.078 --> 54:06.205
I'll quit.

54:06.955 --> 54:08.415
I just have to level off.

54:10.501 --> 54:13.378
Lisa. Give me the name.

54:16.507 --> 54:17.966
Give me the name.

54:28.227 --> 54:29.311
Rujul.

54:30.312 --> 54:31.980
The man I saw was Rujul Aadekar.

54:38.487 --> 54:39.821
It's gonna be okay.

55:03.971 --> 55:04.972
Wait!

55:07.683 --> 55:10.143
Lin, stop! Come on!

55:11.395 --> 55:12.396
Please.

55:12.479 --> 55:14.606
Why? So you can feed me more bullshit
about Madame Zhou

55:14.690 --> 55:16.650
and whatever history you and her have got?

55:16.733 --> 55:19.236
You know, I heard her say
that dead guy's name, Ahmed,

55:20.904 --> 55:22.447
the guy whose suit I was wearing.

55:24.658 --> 55:27.870
-I didn't sign up to feed anyone's habit.
-There's more if you want it.

55:30.747 --> 55:31.748
Fuck you.

55:34.877 --> 55:36.545
You know, I heard Lisa in there.

55:37.796 --> 55:40.632
You got her out
so she could give you some name.

55:42.050 --> 55:43.719
Wasn't to rescue her.

55:43.802 --> 55:48.056
And I wonder what you're so guilty about
that playing the hero was this important.

55:54.897 --> 55:58.108
So this was all just some shit you fed me
'cause you knew I'd bite?

55:58.901 --> 56:00.319
We all have secrets, Lin.

56:01.028 --> 56:03.780
I don't wanna know yours because
I have no intention of telling you mine.

56:05.073 --> 56:08.243
But you're right.
I got Lisa out for my own reasons.

56:08.869 --> 56:11.038
But that doesn't change the good you did.

56:12.289 --> 56:13.582
Don't confuse the two.

56:17.044 --> 56:18.795
I hope you find what you need.

57:11.098 --> 57:12.474
Fuck!

57:21.275 --> 57:24.027
Police! Run!

57:38.333 --> 57:41.962
I felt like I'd been dropped
straight into deep, dark water.

57:42.462 --> 57:44.464
Everything exploding around me.

57:51.930 --> 57:55.392
I didn't know then how far
the ripples from that night would spread

57:55.475 --> 57:56.768
into the future…

57:56.852 --> 57:59.855
I am number one guide in Bombay.
I know everything there is to know…

57:59.938 --> 58:02.733
…touching everyone, friends and enemies…

58:12.284 --> 58:15.162
changing everyone's lives forever.
