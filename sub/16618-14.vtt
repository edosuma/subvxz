12:10.831 --> 12:12.330
Haw-haw!

12:12.332 --> 12:14.833
Where did that
come from?

12:14.835 --> 12:17.869
Um... wow. First of all,
great question.

12:17.871 --> 12:21.072
I guess I just saw a jerk
doing something lame,

12:21.074 --> 12:23.541
and I wanted to make the dope
feel like a dingus.

12:23.543 --> 12:28.079
Well, Mr. Muntz, I just happen
to have one of those "dingi"

12:28.081 --> 12:30.014
right here.

12:30.016 --> 12:33.051
Milhouse, how does it feel
to get a full Nelson?

12:33.053 --> 12:35.120
The first haw
isn't that bad.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.922
But the second one
is devastating.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.792
Wow!<i> Wow!</i>

12:40.794 --> 12:43.962
Sorry, Lisa. Funding has run
out for our radio station.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.131
I'm, uh, gonna have
to take back your hat.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.566
What?!
Jeff and Becky broke up!

12:48.568 --> 12:52.303
Just before the story
of the year!

12:55.942 --> 12:57.976
What's wrong, sweetie?

12:57.978 --> 12:59.911
They took away
my radio station,

12:59.913 --> 13:04.315
which was the only source
of news in a 50-foot area.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.918
You could come with me
to the hot dog stand

13:06.920 --> 13:09.287
and do the word search
on the kids' menu.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.089
Do they have diagonals?

13:11.091 --> 13:15.794
Diagonals! That's where
"race car" was hiding.

13:17.764 --> 13:20.565
Oh, no, the hot dog stand
is closed!

13:20.567 --> 13:23.701
The place I forgot
for 30 years is gone!

13:26.640 --> 13:29.140
There's always a weak link.
There's always a weak link!

13:29.142 --> 13:30.441
(groaning)

13:30.443 --> 13:32.510
We should help that man.
He's choking.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.647
I remember when you used
to help me when I was choking.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.916
Why don't you ask the girl
at the hiking store?

13:37.918 --> 13:40.185
I gave her my number
because I was ordering boots.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.194
Don't let it be forgot
that on this shining spot

13:49.196 --> 13:52.130
was a place I really ate a lot.

13:52.132 --> 13:56.534
I don't see how you can blame
a man of 97 for retiring.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.470
I thought we were
the same age.
So did I.

13:59.472 --> 14:02.574
Well, I hope you didn't
sell it to some clown.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.613
(Krusty's theme song playing)

14:15.956 --> 14:17.956
Here's a check.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.991
Welcome to the
Krusty Burger family.

14:19.993 --> 14:22.894
And since we're family,
we don't talk!

14:24.030 --> 14:25.363
Next problem.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.032
Oh! What else are
you gonna change?

14:28.034 --> 14:31.369
We're gonna keep everything that
makes Deuce's Caboose great.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.338
Like the hot dogs
and the caboose?

14:33.340 --> 14:36.574
No. God, no. We're already
talking to C-list actors

14:36.576 --> 14:38.576
about playing the owner
in commercials.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.012
We're trying to find
a cheap Garrett Morris.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.833
That better be
a monkey's tail I'm feeling.

15:01.835 --> 15:03.835
Uh, chimps have no tails.

15:03.837 --> 15:06.070
Chimps have
no tails?!

15:06.072 --> 15:07.705
Dad, what are we doing?!

15:07.707 --> 15:10.008
I'm saving a precious
childhood memory!

15:10.010 --> 15:12.010
You realize this will be
my childhood memory,

15:12.012 --> 15:14.078
and maybe not so precious?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.080
That's a problem

I have to save
that caboose full of hot dogs,

Never you mind

16:52.112 --> 16:54.145
and which courthouse
we surrendered at.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.847
I said let's ride!

16:59.052 --> 17:00.785
I guess that's it--

17:00.787 --> 17:03.221
the one freeway chase
that ends in failure.

No, you didn't.
Yes, I did!

18:24.104 --> 18:27.038
You needed a father,
and all I could give you

was steamed tubes filled
with chicken asses.
