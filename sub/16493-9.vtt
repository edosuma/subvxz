[Milo] So, we're supposed
to pick a career today?

00:49.667 --> 00:52.917
The job that we're gonna have
for the rest of our lives? Today?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.291
When I was little,
I wanted to be a journalist.

00:55.333 --> 00:56.625
Or, queen of the universe.

00:56.709 --> 00:58.959
You know, only one of
those is actually a career.

00:59.041 --> 01:00.709
When I was little,
I wanted to be a robot.

01:00.792 --> 01:02.250
And that's not a career at all.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.959
Also, none of those are on the list.

01:04.041 --> 01:06.959
But, what if I wanna be an
ophthalmic laboratory technician?

01:07.041 --> 01:08.667
An optha what now?

01:08.750 --> 01:10.792
They make prescription eye
glasses and contact lenses.

01:10.875 --> 01:12.959
Milo, do you actually
want to be an ophtha...

01:13.041 --> 01:16.083
An ophthalmic laboratory technician.
And, no.

01:16.166 --> 01:18.250
But, maybe, I don't know.
What if I wanna do all these things?

01:18.333 --> 01:20.875
I have to decide today?

01:20.959 --> 01:23.333
I already did. Here, I wrote it in.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.792
Journalist slash
queen of the universe.

01:25.875 --> 01:27.166
Now, it's a career.

01:27.250 --> 01:29.417
And some of these don't
even sound like real jobs.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.542
Animator? I think it's a typo.

01:31.625 --> 01:32.875
But, what if that is a real job?

01:32.959 --> 01:34.667
How will I ever decide?

01:36.041 --> 01:40.125
Welcome, children. Our next Career Day
speaker is Milo's father, Mr. Murphy.

01:40.208 --> 01:41.041
Hi, kids.

01:41.125 --> 01:44.166
Mr. Murphy is going to tell us what
the city's Safety Inspector does.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.917
-Mr. Murphy.
-Come on, Dad, wow us.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.208
As the city's key Safety Inspector,

01:48.291 --> 01:49.750
most of my job is just to show up.

01:49.834 --> 01:52.125
When I'm around,
anything that can go wrong, tends to.

01:52.208 --> 01:54.458
And therefore, whatever safety
precautions are in effect,

01:54.542 --> 01:56.041
will be tested to the limit.

01:56.125 --> 01:58.875
So, what are the odds of something
going wrong, while we're here?

01:58.959 --> 02:01.917
Are you kidding?
Milo, his father in the same place.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.667
-Fan blades, water pipes...
-[beeping]

02:04.750 --> 02:06.834
-14:1.
-Really?

02:06.917 --> 02:08.667
So, you wanna piece of that action?

02:08.750 --> 02:10.291
Can I get another hard hat?

02:10.375 --> 02:12.667
And over here is the aeration tank.

02:12.750 --> 02:14.792
It's kinda like a huge dish washer.

02:14.875 --> 02:16.166
We should get one of those for our house.

02:16.250 --> 02:18.709
Sure would help with.
How did your mother put it?

02:18.792 --> 02:20.166
The pile of hate in the sink?

02:20.250 --> 02:21.333
She's got a way with words.

02:21.417 --> 02:22.709
[barking]

02:24.834 --> 02:28.333
Diogee, How did you get in here?

02:28.417 --> 02:29.709
Diogee, go home.

02:29.792 --> 02:30.792
You heard him boy. On your way.

02:35.041 --> 02:38.625
[exclaiming]

02:40.000 --> 02:43.625
Yes! So, burgers or Mexican food?

02:43.709 --> 02:44.959
First, we need to complete our mission.

02:45.041 --> 02:46.750
Which is quite simple, actually.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.750
All we have to do is, make sure that,
that truck filled with pistachios,

02:49.834 --> 02:51.208
gets from A to B.

02:51.291 --> 02:54.041
Literally from A Street,
right here, where we are now,

02:54.125 --> 02:56.959
to the pistachio
warehouse on B Street.

02:57.041 --> 02:58.709
Then we can think about lunch.

02:58.792 --> 03:00.750
And when we think about
it, it will be Chinese.

03:00.834 --> 03:02.000
You know what we should get?

03:02.083 --> 03:03.208
We should get breakfast burritos.

03:03.291 --> 03:05.750
That's breakfast inside of a lunch.

03:05.834 --> 03:07.959
Which is my very objection.

03:08.041 --> 03:10.917
Huh, here's a job called
middle management.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.834
Though, I'm not sure why
middles need to be managed.

03:13.917 --> 03:16.208
Me neither.
I've never seen an unruly middle.

03:16.291 --> 03:18.250
Just wait till you get to my age, boys.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.083
I don't get it. Any way.

03:20.166 --> 03:23.792
Up here we have a real tree.
A drinking water supply hose

03:23.875 --> 03:26.083
that looks a little
like George Washington.

03:26.375 --> 03:28.875
[rotors straining]

03:38.834 --> 03:41.875
[screaming]

03:47.208 --> 03:49.917
[gasps] Don't worry, guys,
I got just the thing.

03:51.041 --> 03:52.875
[Zack] A snowman, really?

03:52.959 --> 03:54.875
[Milo] Hey, the raft is being repaired.

03:54.959 --> 03:56.709
Hey, snowman is an island.

03:56.792 --> 03:58.583
Come, there's room for everyone.

03:58.667 --> 04:01.250
-Oh, no!
-[all] Diogee, go home!

04:02.208 --> 04:04.333
[all scream]

04:05.792 --> 04:08.625
Don't worry, kids, we'll be fine

04:08.709 --> 04:09.959
once the high pressure
water vents open.

04:10.041 --> 04:10.875
[bubbling]

04:14.250 --> 04:18.250
All right, there's the driver,
they're on the move. Let's go.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.250
-Hurry!
-[panting]

04:24.083 --> 04:27.208
I should not have eaten
all those wax lips.

04:27.291 --> 04:29.166
How can you be so out of shape?

04:29.250 --> 04:30.917
You're wearing a track suit.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Well, you're wearing a top
hat, how can you be so...

04:33.083 --> 04:36.625
-I don't know, out of rabbits...
-Hmph.

04:36.709 --> 04:37.917
Oh, no! The truck.

04:40.959 --> 04:43.250
Whoa!

04:46.750 --> 04:48.166
Do you get it? Out of rabbits.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.375
-'Cause you look like a magician...
-I get it...

04:52.125 --> 04:54.333
Hey gather this,
I'm literally riding your coat tail.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.542
[brake screeches]

04:57.625 --> 04:59.834
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:59.917 --> 05:02.083
[thuds]

05:03.250 --> 05:05.792
[murmuring] It's the
same thing every time.

05:05.875 --> 05:08.792
If you want something done right,
you have to do it yourself.

05:08.875 --> 05:11.583
Excuse me. young man,
your boss told me to tell you

05:11.667 --> 05:15.250
that he wants me to drive this
truck, to the warehouse on B Street.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.041
Mr. Roberson said that?

05:17.125 --> 05:19.959
-Yes, he also told me to tell you this...
-Ow! Ow! [groaning]

05:21.041 --> 05:21.917
Come on, Dakota.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.500
[Dakota] Yeah, yeah, I'm way ahead of you.

05:25.667 --> 05:27.875
Well, looks like I
get the afternoon off.

05:27.959 --> 05:30.667
Well, the water venting
system seems to be working.

05:30.750 --> 05:33.375
But, you're gonna wanna check
the stability of the cat walk.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.041
-And...
-[clangs]

05:36.125 --> 05:38.041
You're gonna want to
replace this T-bolt.

05:38.125 --> 05:40.542
Okay, Diogee, now you should go home.

05:40.625 --> 05:43.041
Well, Safety Inspector is an exciting job.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.208
Yeah, I guess so.

05:44.291 --> 05:46.417
Which doesn't really
narrow it down for me.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.583
What am I gonna do? [grunts]

05:48.667 --> 05:50.000
There are only two more stops.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.709
[teacher] Come on kids.

05:51.792 --> 05:54.166
Time to visit Melissa's
father at the fish hatchery.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.959
Your father works at a fish hatchery?

05:56.041 --> 05:57.125
Yeah, I thought he was a fireman.

05:57.208 --> 06:00.709
He is. The fish hatchery
is probably on fire.

06:00.792 --> 06:02.917
Well, the fire's out
and the fish are safe.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.250
Oh yeah, that reminds me,
Milo, you weren't here

06:05.333 --> 06:07.709
at the fish hatchery,
this morning, were you?

06:07.792 --> 06:09.917
-Dad!
-[scoffs] I kid.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.917
But seriously, you weren't here, right?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.750
Oh, Mr. Chase, I'm flattered, but no.

06:14.834 --> 06:16.083
Okay, report finished.

06:16.166 --> 06:17.917
Who'd like a practice run with the hose?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.750
I would. Who knows,
I might wanna be a fireman.

06:20.834 --> 06:22.917
Wait a minute, Milo, a fireman?

06:23.000 --> 06:23.917
He said "might," Dad.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.709
-But...
-[Milo] How do I turn this thing...

06:25.792 --> 06:27.000
[Milo screams] Just breathe.

06:27.333 --> 06:31.583
Whoa!

06:31.667 --> 06:33.750
-Christmas trees for sale.
-[bell ringing]

06:33.834 --> 06:35.125
Get ahead of the Christmas run.

06:35.208 --> 06:37.041
Christmas trees for...

06:37.125 --> 06:41.959
Hurry, they're going fast,
get them while... Oh, forget it!

06:42.041 --> 06:43.166
So, we finally put out the fire.

06:43.250 --> 06:45.625
And no one had anything
to eat since that morning,

06:45.709 --> 06:47.125
so we stopped to buy some hot dogs,

06:47.208 --> 06:48.792
and then Burt goes, "Hey,
we should just start..."

06:48.875 --> 06:49.792
[clears throat]

06:49.875 --> 06:51.667
Sorry, Chief, we're on it.

06:53.208 --> 06:54.583
Whoa!

06:54.667 --> 06:56.709
Well, Milo,
you're the first person in history

06:56.792 --> 06:59.125
to ever start a fire, with water.

06:59.208 --> 07:00.041
Thanks.

07:00.125 --> 07:01.959
Not really a compliment.

07:03.959 --> 07:04.959
[screeches]

07:05.041 --> 07:07.041
There, B Street, was that so hard?

07:07.125 --> 07:11.083
So, we're taking the pistachios
to a steak sandwich place?

07:11.166 --> 07:14.792
This is supposed to be a
pistachio storage facility.

07:14.875 --> 07:16.709
You know what we should get?
We should get a steak sandwich

07:16.792 --> 07:19.041
that's dinner inside of a different lunch.

07:19.125 --> 07:21.792
-I don't understand, this is B Street.
-Yeah. Let me see that.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.834
Oh, here's your problem,
we're supposed to be on B Street South.

07:24.917 --> 07:26.208
That's clear on the other side of town.

07:26.291 --> 07:28.000
We're on B Street North, see.

07:28.083 --> 07:30.083
That's what this little S means.

07:30.166 --> 07:32.834
B Street South.

07:32.917 --> 07:36.083
If it was an 'N' it would be B
Street North. But, this is an S.

07:36.166 --> 07:37.625
I get it.

07:37.709 --> 07:39.709
[teacher] And our final
stop for Career Day

07:39.792 --> 07:42.000
is with Zack's mom, Dr. Underwood.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.083
Hi, Zack's mom.

07:43.166 --> 07:46.250
Please, just call me Dr. Zack's mom.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.625
Did you always know,
you wanted to be a doctor, Dr. Zack's mom?

07:49.709 --> 07:51.250
Milo, are you thinking
about becoming a doctor?

07:51.333 --> 07:52.667
Yeah, maybe.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.250
I've always wondered what it was like

07:54.333 --> 07:56.083
on the other side of the bandage.

07:56.166 --> 07:57.834
What's your specialty, Dr. Zack's mom?

07:57.917 --> 07:59.041
The really bloody stuff.

07:59.125 --> 08:00.834
-[all] Cool!
-[kid] Yeah...

08:00.917 --> 08:02.959
But, since I can't show you that,

08:03.041 --> 08:05.291
how about I show you the
state of the art MRI machine?

08:06.125 --> 08:08.041
Uh, Mr. Draco?

08:08.125 --> 08:10.834
I'll need you to put
your arms at your sides.

08:10.917 --> 08:13.083
Not crossed over
your chest like that.

08:13.166 --> 08:14.208
Are you sure?

08:14.291 --> 08:16.083
This feel's so unnatural.

08:16.166 --> 08:18.959
-[nurse] I'm sure.
-Well, you're the professional.

08:19.041 --> 08:22.583
Now, this is where we monitor
the Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

08:22.667 --> 08:24.750
Or MRI for short. Cool.

08:24.834 --> 08:26.125
-Let me see...
-Quit pushing.

08:26.208 --> 08:28.750
[Dr. Underwood] Okay, kids, let's give
you and this a little bit more space.

08:28.834 --> 08:32.041
-[crackling]
-The MRI is basically a giant magnet...

08:32.125 --> 08:34.166
It controls a very...

08:34.250 --> 08:38.166
Um, so, technically we're never
supposed to put that lever up to 10.

08:38.250 --> 08:41.166
[Draco] Oops, my bad,
I'll uncross my arms.

08:42.083 --> 08:44.208
-[electricity crackling]
-[clangs]

08:45.792 --> 08:47.166
I should just leave.

08:48.625 --> 08:50.834
Okay, who wants to see the emergency exit?

08:51.333 --> 08:52.625
I do.

09:03.208 --> 09:04.792
How did you fit an
anchor in your back pack?

09:04.875 --> 09:07.333
You don't know everything about me.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.417
[screams] Hey!

09:16.500 --> 09:17.667
Who stole my door?

09:23.208 --> 09:26.291
-[whooshing]
-[music playing]

09:26.375 --> 09:28.500
[both] We're finally free!

09:28.583 --> 09:30.208
-[clinking]
-[sipping]

09:30.291 --> 09:34.625
[driver] Yeah, I'm gonna be working
late, so leave me some leftover.

09:34.709 --> 09:36.792
Never mind. I'll be there in 20 minutes...

09:43.250 --> 09:45.333
Uh-oh. This can't be good.

09:49.917 --> 09:51.667
Oh, so this is why they wanted me

09:51.750 --> 09:53.125
to keep my arms on my sides. Wait!

09:53.208 --> 09:55.458
Why did they leave this window open?

09:56.250 --> 09:58.875
So, hospital food it is.

09:58.959 --> 10:00.000
[shatters]

10:00.083 --> 10:03.375
That's lunch,
inside of a hospital.

10:03.458 --> 10:04.625
Hey, Mr. Hartunian.

10:04.709 --> 10:06.333
How do you like, being a bus driver?

10:06.417 --> 10:07.625
How do you like to sit down?

10:07.709 --> 10:09.250
[Milo] I like it just fine, thanks.

10:09.333 --> 10:11.792
Arms on your sides, arms on your
sides, arms on your sides...

10:11.875 --> 10:13.166
Well, what do you think, Milo?

10:13.250 --> 10:14.959
-Did you narrow it down at all?
-No.

10:15.041 --> 10:17.333
I wanna do everything.
And I can't do everything.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.792
You can, if you're a journalist
slash queen of the universe.

10:19.875 --> 10:23.250
I guess. But I still have
one more stop to make.

10:23.333 --> 10:25.667
-Mom!
-[Brigette] Out here, Milo.

10:26.291 --> 10:29.166
-Almost done?
-Ah, work in progress.

10:29.250 --> 10:30.792
Diogee. Go...

10:30.875 --> 10:32.875
-Oh, wait a minute, you are home.
-[sniffing]

10:32.959 --> 10:35.333
-Good boy.
-So, how was Career Day?

10:35.417 --> 10:36.959
I'm just confused.

10:37.041 --> 10:39.667
Seems like, it's really
important to pick a career.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.291
I just don't know what to pick.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.208
Well, don't. Do everything.

10:43.291 --> 10:45.375
Being an architect is my second career

10:45.458 --> 10:47.542
and I've had plenty of jobs before that.

10:47.625 --> 10:50.041
You shouldn't worry too
much about it today.

10:50.125 --> 10:53.208
Just being Milo, that's a full time
job, wouldn't you say?

10:53.291 --> 10:54.834
Yeah, sure keeps me busy.

10:54.917 --> 10:58.000
Besides, I already know
what you're going to be.

10:58.083 --> 11:01.375
-What?
-You're going to be extraordinary.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.083
Oh, Mom!

11:04.291 --> 11:06.208
Okay, where's your anchor?

11:06.291 --> 11:08.291
♪ It's my world and
we're all livin' in it ♪
