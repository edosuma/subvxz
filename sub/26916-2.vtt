WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:12.840
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.

00:13.520 --> 00:15.520
Like my childhood friend Brida,

00:15.600 --> 00:18.800
I was born Saxon but raised as a Dane.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.880
But while she embraced her Viking life,

00:21.560 --> 00:22.920
I chose another path.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.040
My sword is yours.

00:24.600 --> 00:28.720
[Uhtred] Defending King Alfred's Kingdom,
supporting his vision of England,

00:28.800 --> 00:32.159
I earned reputation as a killer of Danes,

00:32.240 --> 00:36.040
and with my loyal followers,
I have slain many a warrior.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.000
Alfred is dying,

00:39.080 --> 00:41.960
and all are vying for power and position.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.600
Alfred will not live forever.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.680
He is constantly ill, but he won't die.

00:45.760 --> 00:46.920
Our ancestors were kings,

00:47.000 --> 00:49.400
yet we're barely acknowledged
as Ealdormen. We deserve more.

00:49.480 --> 00:53.280
[Uhtred] I stole the seer Skade
from her Lord Sigurd.

00:53.360 --> 00:57.200
With Sigurd defeated in battle,
she is tied to me now.

00:57.280 --> 00:58.480
You do not yield.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.040
[Uhtred] My beloved Gisela
did die in childbirth,

01:01.120 --> 01:03.960
leaving me with an infant I despise.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.000
[Hild] She has given you a son.

01:06.080 --> 01:08.040
From this moment forth,

01:08.640 --> 01:10.920
Uhtred of Bebbanburg is cursed.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.320
[Uhtred] She is the power
behind my misfortune.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.520
Destiny is all!

01:16.600 --> 01:18.600
[theme music playing]

02:06.720 --> 02:08.880
[breathing heavily]

02:11.280 --> 02:12.640
[woman] Are you done, Lord?

02:15.400 --> 02:16.320
Not quite.

02:17.560 --> 02:18.680
Soon.

02:24.800 --> 02:25.640
[Hild] Uhtred.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.600
One moment, please.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.720
Lord, I pray,

02:29.800 --> 02:32.000
forgive the breaking
of this peaceful ground.

02:32.840 --> 02:34.000
It is an act of love.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.680
-Amen.
-Amen.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.000
[Finan] Lord.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.880
-Lord.
-[sobbing]

03:33.960 --> 03:35.120
It's beautiful.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.760
She is drifting away from the earth

03:37.840 --> 03:40.520
-and upward to the heavens.
-[Uhtred sniffles]

03:40.600 --> 03:42.480
[Finan] We've done a good thing here.

03:42.560 --> 03:43.920
God knows it.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.040
The gods know it.

04:03.520 --> 04:04.560
Brother Godwin.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.120
Good morning.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.840
Lord. Good morning.

04:08.920 --> 04:12.080
[Aethelwold] I'd like
to speak with you... for a moment.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.080
The girl there...

04:25.400 --> 04:26.240
What of her?

04:26.960 --> 04:28.640
She could well be fond of you.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.200
-Fond?
-As in fondle.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.240
Fondling. And often.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.760
You have my attention, Lord.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.080
Uhtred.

04:49.320 --> 04:52.080
He is not the man to guide Prince Edward.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.320
He is wild, ungodly.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.360
He is half Dane.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.840
Oh, at least.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.840
The Bishop Erkenwald needs to see this.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.760
Alfred needs to be reminded of this.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.800
She could be fond of you
this very evening.

05:13.960 --> 05:17.280
Holy ground has been disturbed,
Brother Godwin.

05:25.360 --> 05:26.640
[Beocca] Uhtred!

05:26.720 --> 05:27.920
Uhtred!

05:29.560 --> 05:31.840
You are needed at the palace by the King.

05:31.920 --> 05:32.840
For what reason?

05:33.480 --> 05:35.200
We are about to return to Coccham.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.720
It would be better
if you heard it from him yourself.

05:39.720 --> 05:40.760
You alone.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.240
[Uhtred] Lord.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.280
Been telling Father Beocca

05:58.360 --> 06:00.760
that you should be
seizing Bloodhair's ships.

06:00.840 --> 06:03.200
Earl Sigurd is finished with, defeated.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.880
Take away his ships
and we take away the means

06:05.960 --> 06:07.400
by which he will leave.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.440
Then take half the ships,
we've killed half his men.

06:10.520 --> 06:13.240
[Edward] Haesten is about to send
Bloodhair on his way.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.360
We've been assured.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.080
He will soon be gone.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.560
To the matter in hand.

06:18.320 --> 06:19.160
Uhtred,

06:19.840 --> 06:22.960
I do not forget what you have
done these past days.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.040
Past years, Lord.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.120
I am acutely aware of what you have lost,

06:30.200 --> 06:31.320
of your suffering.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.400
Lord.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.640
Gisela was a most hospitable woman.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.320
How is the child?

06:39.960 --> 06:41.520
She has given him her strength.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.160
And life.

06:44.680 --> 06:45.720
Yes.

06:47.280 --> 06:48.480
She was a good woman.

06:51.560 --> 06:54.400
-Thank you, Lord.
-There has been a desecration.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.080
You were seen.

06:57.760 --> 06:59.400
[Beocca] The graveyard, Uhtred,

06:59.480 --> 07:01.360
it is blessed holy ground.

07:02.040 --> 07:05.160
You do not have the right
nor authority to break this ground.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.200
You were seen willfully disturbing
the peace of the dead.

07:09.280 --> 07:11.800
I disturbed no one but my wife.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.320
If I have done wrong, I apologize-

07:15.400 --> 07:16.320
It is very wrong.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.920
I put the earth back.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.320
It was a desecration.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.240
Uhtred, I admit I am at a loss
with what to do.

07:22.320 --> 07:23.400
Is an apology enough?

07:24.080 --> 07:26.680
[Beocca] If it is heartfelt, Lord.
God is merciful.

07:26.760 --> 07:29.080
He is, and Uhtred's actions,
understandable.

07:29.160 --> 07:30.880
[Aelswith] But not forgivable.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.760
[Uhtred] I swear, I meant no insult.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.440
If I may speak, Lord?

07:39.160 --> 07:40.760
The woman Gisela was a pagan,

07:41.360 --> 07:43.320
and did not belong in holy ground.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.560
By removing her,

07:45.160 --> 07:47.840
Lord Uhtred was undoing
what shouldn't have been done.

07:48.440 --> 07:50.600
Her presence would have poisoned the soil.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.640
I believe the dead are well rid of her.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.000
Rid of her?

07:54.080 --> 07:56.800
Brother Godwin speaks
in your favor, Uhtred.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.040
[Godwin] I speak the truth.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.280
Gisela was a pagan and a whore,

08:01.840 --> 08:03.880
still married to Aelfric of Bebbanburg.

08:03.960 --> 08:09.360
-You will say no more. You will say no--
-She was a whore. Her children, bastards.

08:09.440 --> 08:10.600
Enough, Godwin.

08:10.680 --> 08:13.000
I'd have the poor wretches
taken and baptized--

08:13.080 --> 08:15.200
Lord, I won't listen to this nonsense.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.800
The souls in heaven are rejoicing...

08:17.880 --> 08:19.960
-Godwin!
-...that the heathen Gisela

08:20.040 --> 08:22.320
has been taken from the earth and burnt!

08:22.400 --> 08:24.600
-Brother Godwin!
-[Godwin] She was no better

08:24.680 --> 08:27.160
than the witch Skade
whom he has brought to--

08:27.240 --> 08:28.360
[grunts]

08:29.240 --> 08:30.280
No more!

08:30.360 --> 08:32.240
-He has struck him!
-I am not blind.

08:32.320 --> 08:35.320
Now it is your turn
to apologize, priest! Insulting women!

08:35.400 --> 08:37.799
Hiding behind your affliction
and your cross!

08:37.880 --> 08:40.360
[Beocca] Get away from him now. Uhtred.

08:40.440 --> 08:43.080
He did himself no favor,
you all heard him!

08:43.159 --> 08:44.560
[Erkenwald] Lord,

08:44.640 --> 08:45.760
I fear he is dead.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.880
He cannot be dead.
It was a slap, no more than that.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.080
He is dead.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.960
It was a slap, Lord,
you saw it for yourself.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.920
-Guards, seize him.
-It was a slap.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.760
Seize him. Seize him now!

09:10.280 --> 09:11.520
I said take hold of him!

09:13.560 --> 09:16.560
Steapa, secure the city walls!
No one is to leave. No one.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.800
[Edward] Lord--

09:17.880 --> 09:19.680
I want him here by nightfall!

09:21.680 --> 09:23.160
Uhtred!

09:23.800 --> 09:26.000
-Uhtred!
-[shushes]

09:26.600 --> 09:28.760
I told you, big man, he's resting.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.480
Uhtred, do not make me fire the house!

09:31.560 --> 09:32.960
That is what I will do!

09:33.040 --> 09:35.560
Steapa, do not make me kill you first,

09:35.640 --> 09:37.960
that is what I will do.

09:38.040 --> 09:41.440
Uhtred, do not make me step
on your Irishman!

09:42.480 --> 09:43.600
That's what I will do!

09:43.680 --> 09:47.040
Oh, for goodness' sake,
stop behaving like children.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.440
You are goading him.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.560
I was, Hild. And enjoying it.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.680
So the Abbess may enter, but I may not?

09:55.760 --> 09:57.360
We're afraid of the Abbess.

09:57.440 --> 09:58.960
[men laughing]

10:00.600 --> 10:01.760
[boy] Sister Hild!

10:04.840 --> 10:06.400
[Hild chuckles] Come to bed.

10:07.720 --> 10:09.840
Lord, there can be no bloodshed.

10:09.920 --> 10:13.640
They are throwing insults out there,
but they will soon tire of that. Come.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.760
There will not be bloodshed.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.440
You should say that to Steapa.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.360
His head is hurting from thinking.

10:22.920 --> 10:23.960
Is there a solution?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.520
I did nothing wrong.

10:25.600 --> 10:26.440
Uhtred,

10:27.000 --> 10:28.200
you killed a monk,

10:28.280 --> 10:29.360
a holy man,

10:29.880 --> 10:31.440
and not for the first time.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.120
And why is she still here?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.960
I am not your concern, witch.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.880
[Uhtred] I did not intend
to kill the monk,

10:37.960 --> 10:39.360
nor do I regret it.

10:39.440 --> 10:40.720
It was fate.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.000
[Uhtred] Fetch Beocca.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.480
Ask him to bring the demands of the King.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.200
I will tell Beocca

10:46.280 --> 10:48.840
that you are ready to talk and to listen.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.160
Be sure that you do.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.720
It would help if you cut her throat.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.480
[Skade] He cannot.

10:56.760 --> 10:57.880
He dare not.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.080
Tonight, Lord...

11:13.360 --> 11:15.320
you'll break your oath to Alfred.
You'll have--

11:15.400 --> 11:16.600
You will be quiet!

11:16.680 --> 11:18.160
It is a new beginning.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.360
I did not wish for a new beginning.

11:22.520 --> 11:23.840
This is your doing.

11:24.840 --> 11:25.680
All of it.

11:25.760 --> 11:28.680
You speak another word
and I will end your life,

11:28.760 --> 11:31.160
no matter the curse nor the consequences.

11:35.760 --> 11:38.520
[Aethelwold] I thought I would
keep you company, Beocca.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.320
I feel more godly just walking beside you.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.600
Aethelwold, you are
only here for the game.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.880
I am, but what a game.

11:46.960 --> 11:47.920
[Beocca] Open up.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.120
Uhtred.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.480
The King and Edward have conferred

11:57.560 --> 11:59.880
and they have decided
there will be no trial.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.440
No punishment,

12:01.520 --> 12:03.880
saving a small wergild
to be paid to the church.

12:03.960 --> 12:04.960
[Finan] A wergild?

12:05.880 --> 12:07.080
100 pieces of silver.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.720
[chuckles] That's all?

12:08.800 --> 12:09.840
Of course not.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.440
One hundred pieces of silver
and your oath.

12:15.760 --> 12:16.840
He has my oath.

12:16.920 --> 12:20.960
[exhales] The King wishes that you swear
an oath to the aetheling, to Edward.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.880
Edward is not the aetheling.
The crown cannot be assumed.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.760
Then Alfred is asking for my life.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.600
Just your loyalty to Edward.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.920
He's a boy! Swear an oath to a boy,
it is the rest of your life.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.880
Father, the King asks too much.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.120
What you must now do, Uhtred,

12:37.200 --> 12:40.560
is consider what will happen
if you do not swear the oath to Edward.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.240
People will die.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.080
It won't just be
the men here who will die!

12:45.160 --> 12:47.400
It'll be the men you fought beside...

12:47.480 --> 12:49.960
-It will be Alfred's doing.
-[Beocca] ...days ago.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.240
He couldn't care less
for men in his service.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.000
The King cares deeply!

12:54.080 --> 12:56.840
You, Beocca, you served him
all your life, and for what?

12:57.520 --> 12:59.680
His witan whisper
about your choice of wife?

12:59.760 --> 13:02.680
Without Alfred, I would be dead!

13:02.760 --> 13:06.960
Without Alfred, there would be no Wessex,
there would be no Mercia, no Christendom.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.960
There would be Danes! And that is all.

13:09.720 --> 13:13.400
The green fields would be red with blood
and I'd be dead.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.520
Look, for all your whines and moans,

13:16.600 --> 13:19.560
Uhtred of Bebbanburg,
you've had a good life here in Wessex,

13:19.640 --> 13:21.600
and don't you dare say otherwise.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.640
Alfred gave you shelter.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.720
I have earned it.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.720
You have land and wealth,

13:29.800 --> 13:31.840
-food and drink.
-I've earned it.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.480
Make your choice, boy!

13:34.560 --> 13:37.560
Accept your punishment
or allow your friends to kill each other,

13:37.640 --> 13:40.840
all to spare you the hardship
of life as a lord!

13:56.760 --> 13:59.160
Did I not say it would be
more than a wergild?

13:59.240 --> 14:02.680
Aethelwold, I swear,
when the killing starts,

14:03.240 --> 14:05.120
you shall be my first.

14:16.360 --> 14:18.000
There will be no killing.

14:24.520 --> 14:25.600
Steapa.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.200
[Steapa] Lord.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.960
I will not fight you
nor any of these men here.

14:31.680 --> 14:33.560
I'll go with you to the King, friend.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.680
I am pleased to hear you say that, Lord.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.160
The King is merciful.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.640
He knows your worth.

14:41.720 --> 14:42.800
We shall see.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.480
You know what to do.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.200
[indistinct chatter]

15:10.400 --> 15:12.240
You have something to say, I'm told.

15:12.800 --> 15:13.960
Lord.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.040
Look around you.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.880
I ask that you remember
my service to you at Ethandun,

15:26.960 --> 15:28.720
and more, much more.

15:29.240 --> 15:32.880
Good service past is no excuse
for breaking the law of the land.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.400
I will pay the wergild,

15:35.720 --> 15:37.840
but though Edward's a fine young man,

15:37.920 --> 15:40.120
I cannot swear an oath I will not keep.

15:40.200 --> 15:44.080
You know this. An oath to protect Edward
is an oath for the rest of my life.

15:50.440 --> 15:53.080
Your word has meaning,
I will give you that,

15:54.600 --> 15:57.640
which is the very reason
I would like you beside my son

15:57.720 --> 15:59.680
when I am gone and he is King.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.080
[Uhtred] You have Steapa.

16:01.160 --> 16:04.080
[Alfred] Steapa at his left hand
and you at his right.

16:05.840 --> 16:09.120
There is no negotiation to be had, Uhtred.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.280
None.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.000
Have I not given enough, Lord?

16:22.640 --> 16:23.760
I beg of you.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.760
Self pity does not suit you.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.840
I am allowing you to live.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.280
You will do as I ask.

16:46.360 --> 16:47.560
No, Lord. I will not.

16:48.520 --> 16:49.800
-Uhtred!
-[Edward] Father!

16:49.880 --> 16:52.400
-Steapa, put down your sword!
-Do nothing more!

16:52.480 --> 16:54.160
-Edward, no!
-Edward, stand still!

16:54.240 --> 16:55.440
Uhtred, this is madness.

16:55.520 --> 16:58.480
Not one man is to take
a single step closer! Not one step!

16:58.560 --> 17:00.160
Steapa, kill the bastard.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.080
-Do it now!
-No!

17:01.160 --> 17:04.920
-[Aelswith] Steapa!
-No man is to make a single move!

17:05.000 --> 17:07.200
No man is to put
the King's life in danger!

17:07.280 --> 17:08.800
Do you understand?

17:08.880 --> 17:11.319
This means death for you,
it can be nothing else.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.839
-Away from the door!
-Uhtred, please.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.720
Every man away from the door!

17:15.800 --> 17:16.880
[Beocca] Uhtred.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.040
Please, I beg of you one last time.

17:19.119 --> 17:20.119
Beocca,

17:20.680 --> 17:22.200
you'll close and bar the door.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.440
You will ensure no one follows.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.800
Not until Alfred himself knocks.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.960
Lord, on my oath, he will not harm you.

17:29.520 --> 17:30.720
But if he does harm you,

17:31.520 --> 17:33.720
I swear, I will kill him myself.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.040
Beocca, the door!

17:35.800 --> 17:36.640
Now!

17:48.200 --> 17:49.720
I gave you glory!

17:50.400 --> 17:52.680
I gave you the freedom
to worship your God,

17:52.760 --> 17:55.320
and still you treat me
no better than a hound!

17:55.400 --> 17:57.360
-I should kill you.
-Then do it,

17:57.440 --> 17:59.880
like the heathen you are.
Think I am afraid?

17:59.960 --> 18:01.120
[grunts]

18:01.200 --> 18:02.920
I can smell the shit on your legs.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Heaven awaits me,

18:04.080 --> 18:06.360
but you shall burn
in hell for all eternity!

18:06.440 --> 18:08.920
Valhalla is a lie and your gods are a lie!

18:09.000 --> 18:11.400
[groans and gasps]

18:14.400 --> 18:16.200
[panting]

18:18.400 --> 18:20.760
I seem to have broken my oath, Lord.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.880
With luck,
the whole of Wessex will now burn.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.040
[groans]

18:31.760 --> 18:33.000
Father Beocca!

18:33.080 --> 18:34.480
Yes, Lord!

18:38.600 --> 18:40.280
Find him and kill him.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.000
[guard 1] He's here! Close the gates!

18:46.840 --> 18:48.640
-I wish no harm.
-[guard 1] Stay there!

18:48.720 --> 18:50.760
-[Uhtred] Stand clear.
-[guard 2] Don't move.

18:58.480 --> 18:59.480
[guard 1] After him!

19:00.200 --> 19:01.320
[Steapa] Uhtred!

19:02.000 --> 19:03.720
Every man with me!

19:09.520 --> 19:11.320
[woman shrieks]

19:14.960 --> 19:15.840
[Steapa] Spear!

19:17.200 --> 19:19.000
Uhtred, don't do it!

19:20.760 --> 19:21.600
[Steapa] Uhtred!

19:22.560 --> 19:23.800
[groans]

19:25.480 --> 19:28.080
You two, come with me!
The rest of you, go round.

19:37.880 --> 19:40.040
[Finan] So, they decided to let you go?

19:41.240 --> 19:43.080
We should ride, hard.

19:43.160 --> 19:46.320
-Lord, you are cut.
-Barely.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.000
We ride to where, Lord?

19:48.080 --> 19:50.160
To Ragnar and to the Danes.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.840
Then we should go meet your men.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
[Uhtred] Hurry!

19:54.080 --> 19:55.080
Hyah, hyah!

19:57.360 --> 19:58.920
Go, all of you.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.160
I wish to be alone.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.120
All of you, go!

20:37.640 --> 20:39.680
[breathing shakily]

21:05.560 --> 21:06.600
[Offa] Lord.

21:06.680 --> 21:07.800
You throw an ax well.

21:08.760 --> 21:09.800
Can you use that sword?

21:12.040 --> 21:13.200
It's not a sword.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.520
It's just the handle.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.800
It did break.

21:16.720 --> 21:17.600
In battle?

21:17.680 --> 21:19.320
[clears throat]

21:20.600 --> 21:21.640
I fell, Lord.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.640
At least you're honest.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.360
-I'm looking for men, guards.
-There are guards at the palace.

21:28.440 --> 21:30.880
No, I am looking to form my own guard.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.960
If you had a sword, could you use it?

21:34.280 --> 21:35.160
I could, yes.

21:36.200 --> 21:38.200
-I'm called Offa.
-Offa.

21:40.640 --> 21:42.800
I will employ you and two others.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.880
You know men who would make good guards?

21:44.960 --> 21:47.680
I do. Good men, friends of mine.

21:47.760 --> 21:49.000
Find them.

21:49.640 --> 21:50.560
We travel tonight.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.520
You will be paid in silver.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.960
Uhtred has thrown
everything away. Everything.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.520
[Thyra] Did he have a choice?

21:59.840 --> 22:00.760
No, he did not.

22:00.840 --> 22:02.800
The King asked for too much.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.600
Alfred offered him forgiveness.

22:04.680 --> 22:08.440
What Alfred did was ignore Uhtred's pain.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.600
This isn't the end of the matter.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.040
It is only the beginning.

22:13.760 --> 22:16.760
If Edward is being made ready to be King,

22:16.840 --> 22:19.560
then Uhtred knows
that Alfred's death is near.

22:20.120 --> 22:22.560
That is what he will tell the Danes.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.080
Lord.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.800
She wishes to speak to you.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.560
I wish to ride alongside you.

22:51.280 --> 22:53.200
Your place is at the back of the line.

22:53.760 --> 22:55.880
I wish to ride alongside you
as your woman.

22:56.680 --> 22:59.200
You have what you have
always craved, your freedom.

22:59.280 --> 23:01.240
Embrace it and embrace me.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.400
Did I not say you would be
in need of a woman?

23:05.160 --> 23:08.240
Do not dare to think
that you can replace my wife!

23:08.320 --> 23:11.360
I saw what would occur to your wife.
I was not the cause.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.360
I know you would like to bed me.

23:16.440 --> 23:18.520
You are Bloodhair's woman, are you not?

23:18.600 --> 23:20.280
Unless you decide to claim me.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.040
Then I will have a decision to make.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.240
Bloodhair's not the warrior that you are.

23:26.320 --> 23:28.320
He is not the king that you can be.

23:29.520 --> 23:30.440
Lord,

23:31.200 --> 23:32.400
we can be enemies

23:33.200 --> 23:34.160
or lovers.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.720
We can suffer or we can rule.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.640
Back of the line.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.480
Then you shall remain cursed!

23:51.000 --> 23:52.080
It's your choice.

24:07.640 --> 24:10.360
Why is she not food for the rats by now?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.600
[Uhtred] Because she has a gift.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.240
[groans]

24:24.000 --> 24:26.400
Because she has taken hold of my path.

24:26.480 --> 24:29.360
If we kill her, the curse will live on.

24:31.760 --> 24:33.680
It is the curse that must be killed.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.160
[Uhtred breathes heavily]

24:49.600 --> 24:51.840
She is the worm and Uhtred is the apple.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.600
I am Aethelwold of Wessex.

25:08.360 --> 25:10.880
We are here to drink
and to see Lord Aethelred.

25:10.960 --> 25:13.160
-[guard] Open the gate!
-In that order.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.960
[Aethelwold swallows]
What is it about Mercian ale?

25:22.040 --> 25:23.440
[Aldhelm] It is the waters.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.360
Divine.

25:28.440 --> 25:29.920
I haven't seen Lady Aethelflaed.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.960
My wife prefers her own company.

25:32.680 --> 25:34.520
She often sits at her own estate.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.600
-Your fair daughter. She's how old now?
-What is it you want?

25:38.040 --> 25:38.960
Say it.

25:41.640 --> 25:42.960
What I want

25:44.440 --> 25:45.680
is your disloyalty

25:47.360 --> 25:48.200
towards Alfred.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.880
You're probably aware
that his health is failing.

25:52.960 --> 25:56.080
His health has been failing
and then recovering for years.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.880
But he is now without
his best warrior and kingmaker...

26:00.280 --> 26:01.160
Uhtred.

26:01.240 --> 26:02.320
Uhtred is dead?

26:02.400 --> 26:06.080
Uhtred is, by now, on his way to Dunholm
and then to Bebbanburg, perhaps.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.280
Where he is not, is Wessex.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.240
Uhtred is no longer Alfred's sword.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.560
Uhtred is gone.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.640
Uhtred is a Dane.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.320
[Uhtred coughs]

26:28.680 --> 26:31.160
My own ambitions are clear,
I have never hid them.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.040
The crown of Wessex is rightfully mine.

26:34.120 --> 26:36.280
But I do not wish to control Mercia.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.040
I have no interest in Mercia.

26:38.120 --> 26:39.400
Yes, yes.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.680
I believe Mercia should have its own King.

26:45.320 --> 26:46.600
You, Aethelred.

26:47.520 --> 26:52.040
What you must understand is
our entire world is about to change.

26:52.120 --> 26:56.080
The opportunity to occupy the throne
of our respective kingdoms is near.

26:57.880 --> 26:58.720
It is now.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.400
And you are suggesting what, exactly?

27:02.880 --> 27:05.800
I am proposing that we ally
ourselves to one another.

27:05.880 --> 27:07.160
A betrothal of sorts.

27:07.240 --> 27:08.480
An alliance.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.760
Lord Aethelred has estate,

27:12.840 --> 27:15.440
a hearth guard and a fyrd to call upon.

27:15.520 --> 27:18.640
You appear to have three men
and a scab-ridden pack-horse.

27:19.480 --> 27:21.560
I won't betray any confidence,
but believe me,

27:21.640 --> 27:22.760
I shall have an army.

27:22.840 --> 27:27.960
As for Lord Aethelred's guard and fyrd,
many say they belong to his wife.

27:28.040 --> 27:30.360
She is the one with a battle reputation.

27:31.440 --> 27:34.200
My men are my own

27:35.240 --> 27:37.640
and no one else's, I can assure you.

27:37.720 --> 27:39.600
I am repeating gossip, no more than--

27:39.680 --> 27:42.600
-My men are my own.
-Agreed.

27:46.840 --> 27:48.040
Though you must worry,

27:48.960 --> 27:51.920
that despite her bravery,
Aethelflaed may come to some harm,

27:52.000 --> 27:54.600
alone on her own estate?
Heavens forbid, but...

27:55.960 --> 27:58.840
should something final befall
his daughter,

27:58.920 --> 28:02.680
I imagine that would weaken
the pretend King further.

28:04.520 --> 28:07.240
I'd guess you would imagine
this weakening quite often,

28:07.320 --> 28:08.520
Lord Aethelwold.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.120
Nightly.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.160
Should we not stop and rest?

28:31.760 --> 28:33.960
I am tired of the sight
of my horse's head,

28:34.040 --> 28:35.280
his ears in particular.

28:35.360 --> 28:37.040
We need shelter and fire, boy.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.400
There's no shelter here.

28:39.400 --> 28:40.720
We keep going.

28:41.560 --> 28:43.120
For a short time at least.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.760
[wind whistling]

28:51.480 --> 28:52.480
[coughs]

28:54.120 --> 28:55.000
[Sithric] Lord!

28:55.600 --> 28:56.800
Lord!

28:57.360 --> 28:59.880
Are you hurt, Lord? Is it your wound?

29:00.600 --> 29:01.720
[Uhtred grunts]

29:03.880 --> 29:04.760
No.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.200
She has me.

29:07.280 --> 29:10.200
[Finan] Jesus, he looks
the color of a Scotsman's arse.

29:10.280 --> 29:11.400
Anything broken?

29:12.040 --> 29:13.880
She is squeezing the life from me.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.880
[Finan] Either that
or the cold has got to your bones.

29:16.960 --> 29:18.520
[groans] Finan,

29:19.160 --> 29:20.400
you will find a cart

29:21.120 --> 29:23.360
and you will haul me to Dunholm, to Brida.

29:24.280 --> 29:25.640
She will know what to do.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.160
[Finan] Get him up.

29:28.240 --> 29:30.000
[grunting]

29:32.960 --> 29:34.040
We're being followed.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.280
No, we are being watched, Offa.

29:40.360 --> 29:44.360
Just ahead, there is a camp full of Danes
led by a man they call Bloodhair.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.360
Hold up the branch.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.880
-Tilberht.
-Higher! Above your head.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.440
[Offa] What does the branch mean?

29:53.080 --> 29:56.000
[Aethelwold] That we are peaceful,
that we wish to talk.

29:57.040 --> 29:59.840
And if they are Bloodhair's men,
which they will be,

30:00.280 --> 30:01.200
with luck,

30:02.400 --> 30:04.080
he'll want to hear what I have to say.

30:04.160 --> 30:06.240
And if they are not?

30:06.320 --> 30:08.120
You will protect me with your lives.

30:09.280 --> 30:10.440
And the branch.

30:17.480 --> 30:20.360
[Offa] My God, there are
hundreds of the bastards.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.520
Every one of them ugly.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.240
Hold the branch high.

30:26.080 --> 30:26.960
Higher!

30:27.640 --> 30:28.800
It's heavy, Lord.

30:28.880 --> 30:30.360
[Offa] Higher, Tilberht!

30:32.120 --> 30:33.520
[Aethelwold] Lord Bloodhair,

30:33.840 --> 30:36.480
Haesten. What a pleasure
to see you as a pair.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.840
-You know this turd, Haesten?
-I do.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.600
Welcome, Lord Aethelwold.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.200
You bring word from Alfred?

30:43.280 --> 30:44.840
I bring word of Alfred.

30:45.880 --> 30:49.200
And I bring word of Uhtred Ragnarson
and of the Lady Skade.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.840
She was once your woman,
I seem to remember.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.640
-Skade lives?
-She does.

30:55.200 --> 30:58.560
And lives well,
with Lord Uhtred snug between her thighs.

30:59.080 --> 31:00.400
But neither are in Wessex.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.080
Where is Uhtred then?

31:02.160 --> 31:03.000
Banished.

31:03.640 --> 31:04.680
An enemy of Alfred.

31:05.720 --> 31:08.600
Heading to Ragnar Ragnarson,
his brother, I would guess.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.760
This turd has knowledge,

31:11.520 --> 31:13.400
and not just of what I've eaten.

31:14.520 --> 31:15.600
I have a proposal.

31:20.840 --> 31:23.800
There already seems to be an alliance
between you.

31:24.920 --> 31:27.480
What I suggest is
that we grow that alliance

31:27.560 --> 31:30.360
and create the greatest
Dane army ever seen.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.760
I propose that we join together.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.160
Us three here, we join with Ragnar

31:35.920 --> 31:37.160
and with Uhtred.

31:38.440 --> 31:39.880
But I want to kill Uhtred.

31:41.120 --> 31:43.400
-And then what, kill Ragnar?
-Or you, perhaps.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.280
We have your story.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.160
What else do you offer?

31:49.840 --> 31:52.440
I offer unrest in Wessex.

31:53.280 --> 31:54.600
By speaking to certain ealdormen,

31:54.680 --> 31:57.480
I could halve the size of Alfred's army
in a moment.

31:58.080 --> 32:01.200
I can be the bridge
between Saxon and Dane.

32:01.280 --> 32:02.440
[Haesten chuckles]

32:06.240 --> 32:07.960
Are you sure Uhtred is in the north?

32:08.040 --> 32:08.960
Yes.

32:09.040 --> 32:12.880
Just as I am sure
that Danes cannot fight Danes,

32:12.960 --> 32:14.600
Danes cannot kill allies.

32:15.720 --> 32:18.560
We cannot ignore the gift
that is presenting itself.

32:18.640 --> 32:21.120
A Wessex without Uhtred to protect it,

32:21.200 --> 32:23.520
a weakened and frail Alfred.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.640
Now is the time for all Danes to gather.

32:25.720 --> 32:26.760
No divisions.

32:27.560 --> 32:29.680
I say that we take that idea north,

32:29.760 --> 32:32.120
to Ragnar and to Uhtred.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.640
I demand

32:36.240 --> 32:38.760
that the sword-Danes unite

32:38.840 --> 32:41.120
and crush the Anglo-Saxons--

32:41.200 --> 32:43.160
It's not your place to make demands.

32:43.800 --> 32:45.400
Enough that you have been heard.

32:48.520 --> 32:49.520
[gasps]

32:52.840 --> 32:54.200
Excellent.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.040
[clicks tongue]

33:08.560 --> 33:09.880
A few days more, Lord.

33:10.480 --> 33:13.080
It is your cart that is slowing us down.

33:33.520 --> 33:35.160
Remember me, arseling? [echoes]

33:37.360 --> 33:40.320
You'll get out of your bed
and make ready. [echoing]

33:41.800 --> 33:44.040
-For what?
-[echoing] To fight me.

33:44.680 --> 33:45.560
Leofric...

33:47.280 --> 33:49.280
I do not wish to fight you.

33:50.840 --> 33:54.480
-Why would I fight you?
-You will fight me, you piece of shit!

33:55.040 --> 33:57.720
For I am Wessex! I am Saxon!

33:57.800 --> 34:00.400
I am for Alfred! And you, arseling,

34:00.480 --> 34:02.600
are a Dane and a traitor.

34:03.160 --> 34:04.240
Fight me!

34:05.000 --> 34:07.040
[coughs]

34:12.080 --> 34:14.880
[breathing heavily]

34:23.719 --> 34:26.000
Can no man hold his tongue?

34:27.000 --> 34:29.440
The country's rife with news
of Uhtred's betrayal

34:29.520 --> 34:30.920
and of my apparent weakness.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.600
-The talk will pass, Lord.
-The talk will only build.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.800
Gossip and rumor will spread
like a summer's fire.

34:37.880 --> 34:41.000
It can only serve to embolden our enemies.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.840
I note that Sigurd's ships remain in Cent.

34:47.920 --> 34:48.760
[Beocca] Yes.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.520
You need to end the gossip, Lord.

34:51.600 --> 34:54.719
A visit, perhaps, not to Sigurd
but to several of the burhs.

34:54.800 --> 34:57.000
The King doesn't have
the strength to travel.

34:57.080 --> 34:58.360
Then something else.

34:59.440 --> 35:00.520
A celebration.

35:01.120 --> 35:04.120
Something that allows you
to show yourself proud, kingly.

35:04.200 --> 35:07.080
For what reason, Father Beocca,
to sap him further?

35:07.160 --> 35:09.200
To demonstrate that he has not weakened.

35:09.280 --> 35:11.360
You will both be silent, I am still here.

35:14.120 --> 35:15.080
Yes, Lord.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.000
What would be this occasion be?

35:21.600 --> 35:22.680
I do not know.

35:23.440 --> 35:24.640
A saint's day?

35:25.920 --> 35:26.960
A thanksgiving.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.640
You may wish to involve Edward.

35:28.720 --> 35:29.920
-A betrothal.
-Edward?

35:30.880 --> 35:31.880
He is old enough.

35:31.960 --> 35:34.600
He's besotted
with the mother of his bastard twins.

35:34.680 --> 35:37.880
Oh, it cannot be her.
She is a cloth's width from a peasant.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.720
Then whomever is most suited?

35:39.800 --> 35:41.880
What it would do is put an end

35:41.960 --> 35:44.440
to one line of gossip and begin another.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.520
Indeed.

35:45.600 --> 35:47.720
Father Beocca, would you leave us, please?

35:50.720 --> 35:51.760
Yes, Lord.

35:57.480 --> 36:00.320
I cannot allow Uhtred's betrayal
nor this...

36:01.280 --> 36:03.400
illness to defeat me.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.840
England must not be forgotten.

36:06.920 --> 36:09.880
Lord, you shall see its birth,

36:09.960 --> 36:12.960
-you will grow strong.
-My dear, I will not see another year.

36:15.320 --> 36:16.160
We know it.

36:19.520 --> 36:22.040
[inhales] We must continue forward.

36:22.120 --> 36:25.920
We must find Edward a suitable match,
one that will strengthen his hand.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.000
But a better match than was
made for Aethelflaed.

36:29.080 --> 36:31.120
Has that marriage not served a purpose?

36:31.880 --> 36:33.360
Aethelflaed has influence.

36:33.440 --> 36:36.280
She's far stronger
than Aethelred the pretty.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.280
What you have begun, Lord,

36:38.360 --> 36:39.800
shall continue.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.240
Our children will build an England,

36:43.920 --> 36:45.080
I swear.

36:52.640 --> 36:53.840
[door opens]

36:53.920 --> 36:56.160
-[Aethelred] Take it.
-[woman giggling] No...

36:56.240 --> 36:57.920
You asked for me, Lord?

36:58.560 --> 36:59.480
I did.

37:01.280 --> 37:02.800
I have been thinking about...

37:04.200 --> 37:06.080
Aethelwold's visit,

37:06.600 --> 37:08.720
what he said about my heroic wife.

37:08.800 --> 37:12.040
The chances of her meeting harm
in one form or another.

37:12.120 --> 37:13.600
And you have decided what?

37:15.440 --> 37:16.480
I want her dead.

37:18.040 --> 37:19.560
And the child with her.

37:45.560 --> 37:49.280
[Cnut] We've been trailing them for
half a day now. They are mostly Saxon.

37:49.360 --> 37:50.560
Some Danes maybe.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.320
They're not of Eoferwic. They're warriors.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.760
They're surrounding the cart, there.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.560
Protecting it and the man that lies on it.

38:01.440 --> 38:04.240
It is the riding in clear sight
I find interesting.

38:04.320 --> 38:05.400
[Brida] Mmm.

38:05.480 --> 38:06.880
They have no fear.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.680
You're staring at me. Why?

38:13.600 --> 38:14.680
I'm looking,

38:15.680 --> 38:16.800
nothing more.

38:18.760 --> 38:21.160
And I'm thinking how fortunate
my cousin is

38:21.240 --> 38:23.320
to have a woman to both love and fight.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.840
So why do you allow him to shame you?

38:31.520 --> 38:32.800
Cnut, you know nothing,

38:33.400 --> 38:34.600
so you will say nothing.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.400
Allow them to continue in peace.

38:40.320 --> 38:41.320
All the way to Dunholm?

38:42.480 --> 38:43.600
That's where they're headed.

38:45.440 --> 38:46.560
[panting]

38:52.840 --> 38:54.320
[Finan] Has he drunk any ale?

38:54.880 --> 38:57.680
-A little.
-A little is of little use.

39:04.520 --> 39:05.520
[sniffs]

39:09.200 --> 39:10.240
All right.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.600
Do you have the strength
to lift a wee cup, Lord?

39:18.120 --> 39:19.080
Hmm?

39:19.160 --> 39:22.080
Even if it is to wet your lips.

39:23.160 --> 39:24.320
Oh, eh.

39:26.520 --> 39:27.640
[exhales weakly]

39:31.200 --> 39:33.880
I'd wager you feel like you're
back on the slave ship.

39:35.080 --> 39:36.840
You got past that nightmare.

39:37.440 --> 39:38.880
You can get past this.

39:39.560 --> 39:40.400
Believe me.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.680
It's her, Finan.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.720
Turning my insides outward.

39:47.640 --> 39:48.960
[Finan] Then kill her.

39:50.280 --> 39:52.280
-Or let me do it for you.
-No.

39:52.360 --> 39:53.400
Uhtred...

39:56.640 --> 39:58.640
I fear you are dying.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.960
Sihtric says we will arrive
at Dunholm tomorrow.

40:11.640 --> 40:13.840
They've been watching us
for most of the day.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.320
At least, I hope it's them.

40:43.320 --> 40:44.160
Broth, Lord.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.040
I made it myself.

40:46.960 --> 40:50.040
I did the same at the monastery
and the Brothers devoured it.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.200
[grunts]

40:52.280 --> 40:54.000
Please, it'll make your strength.

40:57.640 --> 40:59.400
[Leofric] Now you know
how Alfred would feel.

41:01.480 --> 41:02.840
Belly and bones aching.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.320
[neighing]

41:04.400 --> 41:06.480
But every day he got to his feet,

41:07.600 --> 41:09.600
and every day he built Wessex.

41:10.520 --> 41:12.840
-With my sword.
-Lord?

41:12.920 --> 41:13.760
My arse.

41:14.440 --> 41:16.400
He built Wessex with my sword.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.640
I see my sister's boy is with you now.

41:27.440 --> 41:28.920
Alfred's bastard.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.240
The Monk.

41:31.360 --> 41:32.960
He's no warrior.

41:33.040 --> 41:34.560
[Leofric] Then why is he here?

41:37.280 --> 41:38.280
[Uhtred] Gisela.

41:38.360 --> 41:41.000
It's the fever. It will pass.

41:41.080 --> 41:42.880
[Skade] He sees someone.

41:42.960 --> 41:44.400
It is the gods,

41:45.560 --> 41:46.840
tormenting him.

41:47.480 --> 41:49.040
[Leofric] Who is Gisela?

41:49.880 --> 41:50.880
[Uhtred] My wife.

41:50.960 --> 41:52.320
Another one?

41:53.720 --> 41:54.760
How many is that?

41:56.240 --> 41:58.320
So this Gisela is to blame

41:58.400 --> 42:01.560
for making my nephew a traitor
to his country?

42:03.720 --> 42:05.320
She was fond of him.

42:06.480 --> 42:08.400
That is why he is with me.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.280
You look sickly.

42:16.320 --> 42:18.440
What has she done to you, the witch there?

42:22.200 --> 42:24.120
It is a death you will deserve,

42:24.200 --> 42:26.840
for you have made
every man here a traitor.

42:27.480 --> 42:29.360
Alfred is their King.

42:29.440 --> 42:30.480
You are dead!

42:30.560 --> 42:33.240
Alfred does not mourn you,
so why speak for him?

42:33.320 --> 42:35.200
You are dead! [coughing]

42:35.280 --> 42:38.480
Lord, Lord. You must eat
and you must drink.

42:38.560 --> 42:41.040
You are not thinking right.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.760
[breathing heavily]

42:47.240 --> 42:49.400
-Brida.
-She will be at Dunholm.

42:49.480 --> 42:50.920
[Sihtric] Finan, look.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.200
[Brida] I'm here.

42:53.960 --> 42:55.200
[Finan] Brida?

43:19.160 --> 43:21.480
Jackdaw, any trouble in the night?

43:21.560 --> 43:22.720
She showed me her tits.

43:23.640 --> 43:24.920
They looked very nice.

43:32.640 --> 43:34.000
[Brida] You say you're a seer,

43:34.560 --> 43:35.760
but you have no runes.

43:35.840 --> 43:38.440
-What is this?
-Unless you hid them up your arse?

43:43.280 --> 43:44.960
I wish to see my Lord, Uhtred.

43:46.840 --> 43:48.280
And you will bring him to me.

43:49.280 --> 43:50.240
You'll shut your mouth.

43:50.320 --> 43:53.440
Bring him to me or I'll bind
your path to that of a river rat!

43:54.200 --> 43:55.680
[Brida grunts]

44:01.240 --> 44:03.600
You will not throw curses. Not here.

44:04.440 --> 44:06.960
Not now I have this Nithstong
to block your powers.

44:09.520 --> 44:10.920
This is Freya's soil now.

44:11.800 --> 44:14.440
The goddess who brought
the magic to the gods will protect us.

44:15.200 --> 44:18.160
Don't make me bring the seer
to whom this Nithstong belongs.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.560
She is blood-tied to Freya.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.320
Don't make her destroy you.

44:25.360 --> 44:26.720
I swear...

44:27.640 --> 44:29.480
I will kill you, bitch.

44:31.200 --> 44:32.600
-Jackdaw...
-Hmm?

44:32.680 --> 44:34.920
Keep your hands on your sword
and your eyes off her tits.

44:35.600 --> 44:37.040
She's cleverer than you.

44:37.120 --> 44:38.400
I heard that.

44:48.480 --> 44:49.480
Good?

44:49.560 --> 44:50.720
It is good.

44:51.720 --> 44:53.120
We thought you'd gone, Lord.

44:54.560 --> 44:55.680
The same.

44:56.960 --> 44:59.920
I feared I'd die an old man's
death under furs.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.600
[Cnut] So, the great
Dane-slayer was afraid?

45:05.120 --> 45:07.640
-You are who?
-He's no one important, Uhtred.

45:08.440 --> 45:10.760
-I am Cnut.
-You are what?

45:10.840 --> 45:12.040
[Ragnar] He is Cnut.

45:12.720 --> 45:15.240
He's my cousin
on my mother's side.

45:15.880 --> 45:16.840
I'm a Dane,

45:17.560 --> 45:18.560
Lord Uhtred.

45:19.680 --> 45:21.160
So are you gonna kill me too?

45:22.040 --> 45:23.280
You talk like an infant.

45:23.360 --> 45:25.840
How many have you
already despatched to Valhalla?

45:26.400 --> 45:28.680
Is it twelve? Twenty? Forty?

45:28.760 --> 45:31.680
You'll shut your mouth now.
Show my brother some respect.

45:31.760 --> 45:33.320
Or I may have to kill one more.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.520
[men laughing]

45:36.120 --> 45:37.240
He's back!

45:37.880 --> 45:39.000
He's back.

45:40.000 --> 45:40.920
Get up.

45:42.120 --> 45:43.880
Up on your feet!

45:45.240 --> 45:46.080
Get up.

45:47.280 --> 45:48.400
[grunts]

45:51.880 --> 45:53.280
He is back where he belongs.

45:54.960 --> 45:57.720
Where he has always belonged.

46:00.240 --> 46:01.680
You're a Dane for life now.

46:02.800 --> 46:03.960
Say it.

46:06.160 --> 46:07.480
I am a Dane for life.

46:08.560 --> 46:09.760
No.

46:11.000 --> 46:11.920
Say it.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.480
[thumping]

46:15.880 --> 46:17.640
I am a Dane for life.

46:17.720 --> 46:19.240
[thumping continues]

46:19.320 --> 46:20.320
Mean it!

46:20.960 --> 46:22.840
I am a Dane for life!

46:22.920 --> 46:24.720
From this day onwards.

46:24.800 --> 46:26.000
From this day onwards.

46:29.160 --> 46:31.080
This means everything to me.

46:31.160 --> 46:32.360
[men cheer]

46:42.800 --> 46:45.880
[Finan] So, do you have an army,
Lord Cnut?

46:45.960 --> 46:46.800
[Cnut] I do.

46:47.440 --> 46:49.520
Two hundred men. Two hundred good men.

46:49.600 --> 46:51.760
Are they all as entertaining as you are?

46:51.840 --> 46:54.040
-You are headed where?
-[Cnut] Undecided.

46:54.800 --> 46:57.800
Though if Alfred of Wessex is
now without his Dane-slayer,

46:57.880 --> 46:59.240
may consider heading south.

46:59.320 --> 47:02.600
Call me Dane-slayer once more,
and we'll fight.

47:02.680 --> 47:04.400
Why the anger, Lord?

47:05.400 --> 47:08.360
You deny you killed many of us?
Many Danes, many Northmen?

47:09.080 --> 47:11.160
Only the ones who were trying to kill me.

47:14.480 --> 47:16.360
And I'm only teasing, unfairly.

47:16.440 --> 47:18.760
You must be tired
from your journey and your...

47:19.400 --> 47:20.320
illness.

47:21.640 --> 47:23.080
So be sure to rest.

47:29.040 --> 47:30.040
I like him.

47:30.120 --> 47:31.800
Not as much as he likes himself.

47:31.880 --> 47:32.840
[chuckling]

47:39.520 --> 47:40.880
Well, he's not wrong.

47:40.960 --> 47:43.080
The prospect of Alfred without Uhtred

47:43.160 --> 47:45.600
will bring fire to the bellies
of many Danes.

47:47.080 --> 47:48.240
You included?

47:51.640 --> 47:53.520
Wessex is still the jewel,

47:53.600 --> 47:56.040
and I'm getting too comfortable
in my fortress.

47:56.120 --> 47:57.600
My children are in Wessex.

47:57.680 --> 47:59.280
We have many friends in Wessex.

47:59.360 --> 48:01.000
More reasons to visit.

48:05.240 --> 48:07.240
Well, this talk is for another time.

48:08.040 --> 48:09.280
Another time soon.

48:10.360 --> 48:12.040
You've not asked about Thyra.

48:14.920 --> 48:16.480
The boy Osferth told me.

48:17.320 --> 48:18.320
She is Christian,

48:18.960 --> 48:20.000
and she's married.

48:21.880 --> 48:22.800
She is happy.

48:26.880 --> 48:27.840
[Finan] Uhtred.

48:30.960 --> 48:34.040
I came here to rest, to hunt,

48:34.680 --> 48:36.560
find a woman, maybe.

48:37.840 --> 48:40.320
I did not come here
to talk of war against Alfred.

48:42.880 --> 48:45.920
I will be outside drinking ale.

48:47.480 --> 48:48.880
Finish your plate.

48:58.040 --> 48:58.880
Where is she?

49:00.440 --> 49:01.360
Skade?

49:02.200 --> 49:04.680
Caged for now. She can't reach you.

49:05.520 --> 49:06.720
She's got power, Uhtred.

49:08.080 --> 49:10.480
-I have felt it.
-Power that you could wield.

49:11.440 --> 49:14.320
It's the way she works, through a man.
A warrior.

49:15.760 --> 49:17.360
My sword is all I need.

49:18.120 --> 49:20.640
I'll not give half of myself
over to a seer.

49:20.720 --> 49:22.000
Then you must kill her.

49:24.840 --> 49:26.040
I want to, but how?

49:26.120 --> 49:29.400
Her curse must die with her.
How can I be sure that it does?

49:30.080 --> 49:30.960
I'll ask.

49:31.960 --> 49:34.040
I'll ask a seer more powerful than Skade.

49:36.440 --> 49:38.640
-When?
-When I am sure of you,

49:39.320 --> 49:40.480
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

49:42.080 --> 49:43.240
[sighs]

50:04.960 --> 50:08.280
[sighs] I remember
the very first time I took your hand.

50:08.360 --> 50:09.440
[chuckles softly]

50:11.680 --> 50:13.840
On the steps of the great hall
in Eoferwic.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.280
A priest was hanging from the wall,

50:21.440 --> 50:24.160
a spear through his chest. [laughs]

50:27.840 --> 50:29.600
Ragnar tells me you have children.

50:32.320 --> 50:34.840
No. No, I am not a mother, no.

50:34.920 --> 50:36.960
But Ragnar has children by other women.

50:38.680 --> 50:39.960
I, too, have been cursed.

50:41.200 --> 50:43.040
A child refuses to grow inside me.

50:45.840 --> 50:47.920
My first loss was our child in the wood.

50:50.280 --> 50:52.960
No matter. Eat as much as you are able.

50:53.040 --> 50:55.160
He will expect you to drink
and play games.

50:59.320 --> 51:00.800
Brida. [clears throat]

51:00.880 --> 51:01.880
Hmm?

51:05.880 --> 51:07.000
I'm sorry for you.

51:09.680 --> 51:10.880
Ragnar is my child.

51:15.320 --> 51:16.640
Betray him and I will kill you.

51:18.120 --> 51:19.400
If you are now a Dane,

51:20.120 --> 51:21.560
you must undo the past.

51:23.760 --> 51:25.880
Undo the past? How?

51:27.520 --> 51:28.880
You must destroy Alfred.
