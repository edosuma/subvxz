00:00.918 --> 00:02.501
- Tonight, it's part three

00:02.501 --> 00:05.417
of "The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills Reunion."

00:05.417 --> 00:07.083
I want to talk about
the leather pants.

00:07.083 --> 00:08.459
[upbeat music]

00:08.459 --> 00:11.792
Who would trust Kathy
to do dental work?

00:11.792 --> 00:13.751
- Oh, hell no.
- [laughs]

00:13.751 --> 00:15.501
- My heart broke
when you shared

00:15.501 --> 00:17.626
your dad's experience
with racism.

00:17.626 --> 00:21.125
Why do you think you never
spoke about it before?

00:21.125 --> 00:22.792
We're gonna put you
on a skewer,

00:22.792 --> 00:24.334
and I'm gonna
fire up the barbecue.

00:24.334 --> 00:26.375
- And I'm so ----ing
ready for you.

00:26.375 --> 00:28.250
- It lands differently

00:28.250 --> 00:31.209
when there are
air crash victims.

00:31.209 --> 00:33.792
- It does. It does.
- Seems tone deaf.

00:33.792 --> 00:36.000
- You know, I've been reading
you're upset with me.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.959
- To watch the four of you
mock my life really hurt me.

00:40.959 --> 00:43.792
- We don't always do what
everybody thinks we should do.

00:43.792 --> 00:46.792
- You also don't know what
I have done or what I will do.

00:46.792 --> 00:48.709
- What will you do?

00:48.709 --> 00:50.334
- You'll just have to wait
and see, won't you?

00:50.334 --> 00:54.667
[dramatic music]

00:54.667 --> 00:58.083
[tense music]

00:58.083 --> 01:00.918
- How many episodes
of "American Woman"

01:00.918 --> 01:02.292
did you wind up watching?

01:02.292 --> 01:04.459
- You know,
I watched a trailer.

01:04.459 --> 01:06.834
I don't watch TV much.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.751
- Given what an issue it was--

01:08.751 --> 01:10.042
When was the last time
you spoke?

01:10.042 --> 01:11.626
- Six months ago.

01:11.626 --> 01:13.083
- This is all over the show.

01:13.083 --> 01:14.292
- Yeah.

01:14.292 --> 01:15.459
- Do you think maybe
if you had watched it

01:15.459 --> 01:18.083
that maybe would have
put that to bed a little bit?

01:18.083 --> 01:22.501
- No, because I don't even talk
to my mother's friends.

01:22.501 --> 01:25.042
The fact that
she's not here anymore--

01:25.042 --> 01:26.375
it's just very hard for me.

01:26.375 --> 01:29.209
- Oh.

01:29.209 --> 01:33.417
- [sobs]

01:33.417 --> 01:37.959
- It's too hard for her.
It's too hard.

01:37.959 --> 01:49.083
- [sobs]

01:49.083 --> 01:54.751
It's okay. It's okay.

01:54.751 --> 01:56.375
Okay.
- Okay.

01:56.375 --> 02:02.501
- Kyle, knowing what a wedge
"American Woman" caused,

02:02.501 --> 02:05.083
do you regret doing it?
- I actually don't

02:05.083 --> 02:06.751
because I know
I didn't do anything wrong.

02:06.751 --> 02:08.125
- Right.

02:08.125 --> 02:09.959
- So for me, it was, like,
exciting and fun

02:09.959 --> 02:11.542
that I could, you know,
do this project

02:11.542 --> 02:13.209
that really was a love letter
to my mom,

02:13.209 --> 02:15.042
even though
it wasn't biographical.

02:15.042 --> 02:17.459
- Mm-hmm.
- I felt bad that--

02:17.459 --> 02:19.125
that they thought it was
something that it wasn't.

02:19.125 --> 02:22.125
And I was hoping
that they would watch.

02:22.125 --> 02:24.501
So I was frustrated thinking,
"Just watch.

02:24.501 --> 02:28.334
I would never do anything
to hurt our mom or us ever."

02:28.334 --> 02:30.417
- How did you two
come back together?

02:30.417 --> 02:32.626
Who picked up the phone first
or how did it happen?

02:32.626 --> 02:34.083
- It was--
- I think probably me.

02:34.083 --> 02:35.709
- "I think probably me."
[laughter]

02:35.709 --> 02:37.959
No, honestly,
I was gonna say our kids

02:37.959 --> 02:41.375
because our kids
are unbelievably close.

02:41.375 --> 02:42.584
- Yeah.
- And it was--

02:42.584 --> 02:45.209
every Christmas, it was like,
"This is not fair to us."

02:45.209 --> 02:46.417
- Mm.
- You know?"

02:46.417 --> 02:49.334
And they'd be like, "Well,
I want to have your turkey

02:49.334 --> 02:51.584
and your this, and we want
to be with Aunt Kathy's this."

02:51.584 --> 02:53.751
You know, and we were
always having to divide

02:53.751 --> 02:56.042
and then people's feelings were
being hurt, you know?

02:56.042 --> 02:58.167
Eventually, it was like,
"Well, we got to do something

02:58.167 --> 02:59.626
for the holidays"
kind of thing.

02:59.626 --> 03:01.459
And then it was like a little
by little trickling

03:01.459 --> 03:03.292
and calling each other
about that.

03:03.292 --> 03:06.501
- So you think it was the kids?
Kathy thinks it was her.

03:06.501 --> 03:07.834
[laughter]
Yes.

03:07.834 --> 03:09.125
- Kathy thinks it is her.
- Yes.

03:09.125 --> 03:10.834
When you came together,

03:10.834 --> 03:13.209
did you hash out
all of your issues?

03:13.209 --> 03:15.334
I mean, I got the sense
from seeing you two

03:15.334 --> 03:17.083
sitting in front
of the TV trays,

03:17.083 --> 03:18.626
it's not necessarily something

03:18.626 --> 03:20.876
that you two have
ever really worked out.

03:20.876 --> 03:22.834
- Andy, I think
you're our psychiatrist.

03:22.834 --> 03:25.083
[laughter]
- That's what I'm here for.

03:25.083 --> 03:26.918
Yeah.
- No, it wasn't, you know--

03:26.918 --> 03:28.292
- That was one of
the first times.

03:28.292 --> 03:29.667
- It was, yeah.

03:29.667 --> 03:33.375
- What I find with people is
you have to find the right time

03:33.375 --> 03:38.125
and that people say they want
the truth or they want to talk.

03:38.125 --> 03:41.334
But the minute you go to start,
they sometimes don't like it.

03:41.334 --> 03:43.292
- Yeah.
- That's right.

03:43.292 --> 03:46.834
- It was poorly handled
on both of our parts.

03:46.834 --> 03:49.125
There was way
too much time wasted.

03:49.125 --> 03:52.042
- Do the four of you now
get together?

03:52.042 --> 03:53.459
- You mean Mauricio and Rick?

03:53.459 --> 03:54.959
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, we're all--

03:54.959 --> 03:56.542
- Yeah.
- Yep.

03:56.542 --> 03:58.334
- That's great.
- Yeah.

03:58.334 --> 03:59.542
- Do you think this show

03:59.542 --> 04:01.375
brought the two of you
together at all?

04:01.375 --> 04:02.417
- Honestly, I do

04:02.417 --> 04:04.959
because look how busy
you are doing the show.

04:04.959 --> 04:06.167
- I mean...
- So it has been

04:06.167 --> 04:08.000
a great opportunity.
- It really has been.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.209
I mean, we were obviously
speaking before,

04:10.209 --> 04:12.792
which is why I really wanted
her to be a part of the show.

04:12.792 --> 04:15.626
But in doing the show,
you know, she had never had--

04:15.626 --> 04:16.834
I can't get my voice back.
Sorry.

04:16.834 --> 04:18.250
- Aw.
- She had never done

04:18.250 --> 04:20.292
a girls' trip
or anything like that.

04:20.292 --> 04:22.459
So it was fun for me.
I mean, I joke like,

04:22.459 --> 04:23.709
"Oh, my gosh.
She wants me to do everything."

04:23.709 --> 04:26.417
But she makes me laugh so much.
So it was fun, you know,

04:26.417 --> 04:29.459
seeing her for the first time
ever driving by herself.

04:29.459 --> 04:31.918
- Kyle, I need
to find that purse.

04:31.918 --> 04:34.125
- Have someone meet you
at the 405 and Sunset.

04:34.125 --> 04:35.459
- But I don't have a phone
to tell them.

04:35.459 --> 04:37.000
- Who do I ask for
if I call the house?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.667
- The lady.
- Who's the lady?

04:38.667 --> 04:41.125
She's just making me
laugh the whole time.

04:41.125 --> 04:43.542
So it was really nice.
So in that aspect, yes.

04:43.542 --> 04:45.626
- By the way, Kathy,
who is the lady?

04:45.626 --> 04:47.167
- The lady?
- Yeah.

04:47.167 --> 04:49.042
- The lady that was gonna
meet you at the 405.

04:49.042 --> 04:51.125
- That's so funny.
- Oh, Paula.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.292
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

04:53.292 --> 04:54.542
- She works for you?
- Yes.

04:54.542 --> 04:55.584
- Okay.

04:55.584 --> 04:57.209
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

04:57.209 --> 04:58.834
Feel like I'm at
the Waldorf Astoria.

04:58.834 --> 05:00.751
- You want seasoning or chips?

05:00.751 --> 05:01.959
- No, I'm okay.

05:01.959 --> 05:04.751
- Thank you, Paula.
- Thank you.

05:04.751 --> 05:06.584
- Kate Casey tweeted,

05:06.584 --> 05:10.542
"Do Rick and Kathy Hilton eat
on tray tables every night?"

05:10.542 --> 05:12.167
- We do.
- You do?

05:12.167 --> 05:13.542
- With our kids.
Yes, we like that.

05:13.542 --> 05:15.334
- With the kids?
- It's cozy.

05:15.334 --> 05:17.792
- "It's cozy."
- "It's cozy." [laughs]

05:17.792 --> 05:19.125
- Louise from Albuquerque said,

05:19.125 --> 05:21.042
"Forget Kyle and Kathy's
problems.

05:21.042 --> 05:22.501
What's up with Garcelle

05:22.501 --> 05:24.918
forgetting her
own sisters' names?"

05:24.918 --> 05:27.626
Garcelle, have you heard
from your sister Carole

05:27.626 --> 05:29.083
about you forgetting her name?

05:29.083 --> 05:30.667
- I love my sister Carole.

05:30.667 --> 05:31.792
I'm the last of seven.

05:31.792 --> 05:37.876
There's Maurice, Yves-Rose,
Gladys, Chantal, Elie.

05:37.876 --> 05:39.250
Who am I missing?
I'm missing someone.

05:39.250 --> 05:42.959
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That's terrible.

05:42.959 --> 05:45.501
My sister Carole.
I forgot about her.

05:45.501 --> 05:47.918
Oh, my God.
I love you, Carole.

05:47.918 --> 05:50.959
It's interesting because we've
sort of had a falling out.

05:50.959 --> 05:53.209
And this is making me
see it differently.

05:53.209 --> 05:54.918
- Oh!
- Oh, really?

05:54.918 --> 05:56.375
- Yeah.
- How so?

05:56.375 --> 05:59.000
- Something happened
and we didn't talk about it,

05:59.000 --> 06:01.292
and just let it sort of fester.

06:01.292 --> 06:06.209
And it just sort of went away.
We haven't spoken.

06:06.209 --> 06:07.792
So this is really great.

06:07.792 --> 06:10.584
- Was it then Freudian that
you couldn't remember her name?

06:10.584 --> 06:11.584
- Maybe.

06:11.584 --> 06:12.751
- I mean...
- Maybe.

06:12.751 --> 06:14.626
- It seems--
- Yeah, absolutely.

won your poll tonight.

06:26.626 --> 06:29.709
[cheers and applause]
I mean, Kyle, wow.

06:29.709 --> 06:31.709
Kyle, you've been
on the show for ten years.

06:31.709 --> 06:33.876
How jealous did that make you?

06:33.876 --> 06:36.417
- I don't feel
jealous of my sister.

06:36.417 --> 06:38.083
- That's just 'cause I'm new.

06:38.083 --> 06:43.250
- How has Kim reacted to
the emergence of Kathy Hilton

06:43.250 --> 06:44.834
on "The Housewives
of Beverly Hills"?

06:44.834 --> 06:46.292
- She loves it.
- She does?

06:46.292 --> 06:47.459
- She loves it.
- Aw.

06:47.459 --> 06:49.459
- You know, I called her
and talked to her about it.

06:49.459 --> 06:51.000
I said,
"Well, what do you think?"

06:51.000 --> 06:54.459
And she said, "Yeah,
just don't lose your temper."

06:54.459 --> 06:55.876
- [chuckles]

06:55.876 --> 06:56.792
- Yeah, right.

06:56.792 --> 06:59.792
That's very hard
in this group sometimes.

06:59.792 --> 07:01.667
- Kyle, Ruby
from Edmond, Oklahoma,

07:01.667 --> 07:04.292
wants to know how
your relationship with Kim is

07:04.292 --> 07:06.375
and do you have
her current phone number?

07:06.375 --> 07:08.042
- [laughs]
- That's cute.

07:08.042 --> 07:09.792
- I want to know that too.

07:09.792 --> 07:11.375
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I forgot that one.

07:11.375 --> 07:13.751
- Yes, I do have
her current phone number.

07:13.751 --> 07:15.334
And we are good.

07:15.334 --> 07:17.959
I posted something with Kathy
and me in the kitchen,

07:17.959 --> 07:20.709
laughing when she'd served them
stale old bread

07:20.709 --> 07:22.751
in an ugly bowl
with a dish towel.

07:22.751 --> 07:25.876
[laughs]

07:25.876 --> 07:27.959
Kathy, I'm peeing my pants.
Stop.

07:27.959 --> 07:29.375
So Kim posted,

07:29.375 --> 07:31.709
"I cannot stop watching this
and laughing about this."

07:31.709 --> 07:32.918
So she thinks it's funny.

07:32.918 --> 07:34.501
- I was hoping to see
the three of you

07:34.501 --> 07:36.709
at some point this season.

07:36.709 --> 07:37.876
- We'll see.

07:37.876 --> 07:41.042
You know, we can have fun
together and laugh together.

07:41.042 --> 07:44.250
And I think there's a place and
time where that will happen.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.501
- That's great.

07:45.501 --> 07:47.083
We're gonna be back
in a moment.

because you're Asian.

spoke Chinese to us.

08:46.667 --> 08:48.209
But with my kids,

08:48.209 --> 08:52.459
I just don't want them
to lose the Chinese culture.

08:52.459 --> 08:53.709
- Okay, you ladies look great.

08:53.709 --> 08:55.375
And we're gonna start
on all fours.

08:55.375 --> 08:57.501
I just want you
to come over, all fours.

08:57.501 --> 09:00.375

why I wore my pants.

09:00.375 --> 09:01.834

09:01.834 --> 09:03.918

with body image.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.125
I'm a recovering bulimic.

09:05.125 --> 09:06.459
So like--
- Oh.

09:06.459 --> 09:07.667
- And I say recovering
because, like, it's--

09:10.584 --> 09:12.209
- How long have you
had this problem?

09:12.209 --> 09:13.751
- I became a bulimic
when I was 11.

09:13.751 --> 09:17.167
I watched a video in class
about eating disorders.

09:17.167 --> 09:19.209
And obviously,
it was a negative message.

09:19.209 --> 09:21.626
And then I sort of picked up
some tools from it.

09:21.626 --> 09:23.000
And that's when it began.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.959
- Why don't we play this game
where we say three things?

09:24.959 --> 09:26.125
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:26.125 --> 09:28.000

09:43.584 --> 09:44.709

09:48.792 --> 09:52.501
You know, wow.

09:52.501 --> 09:56.125
- So how did you land a job
at an escort agency?

09:56.125 --> 09:59.125
- So it was the summer between
high school and college.

09:59.125 --> 10:00.667
- Prime time to work
at an escort agency.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.292
- Right.
Well, I was 18.

10:02.292 --> 10:03.918
So it was
an advertising company

10:03.918 --> 10:06.042
that advertised escorts.

10:06.042 --> 10:08.292
And we would put
their photo on the back

10:08.292 --> 10:10.292
with their phone number.
So they get called directly.

10:10.292 --> 10:12.584
But it's funny when you say
something like that.

10:12.584 --> 10:14.542
And then I've never
been public,

10:14.542 --> 10:17.542

to warm up to people.

10:20.334 --> 10:21.751
What made you think--
- That.

10:21.751 --> 10:23.125

your kind of chick?

10:23.125 --> 10:24.375
- That.
- That? Yeah.

10:24.375 --> 10:26.792

she would be so open

10:28.250 --> 10:30.250
that, you know, many people
would have been "Eh."

And then the proposition

You know,
I wasn't gonna let it go.

to abuse your privacy.

My feeling of violation
was true to me.

to police my feelings.

the other side of racism.

14:24.334 --> 14:25.918

14:25.918 --> 14:28.417
I remember I was in

14:28.417 --> 14:29.709
He was pumping gas.

14:29.709 --> 14:31.709
And there was a man
screaming at him,

14:31.709 --> 14:35.125
"Get out of my country.
You're taking all our money."

14:35.125 --> 14:37.709
- Why do you think he never
spoke about it with you?

14:37.709 --> 14:41.959
- You know, I think that's sort
of the classic Asian way.

14:41.959 --> 14:45.125
My dad was an immigrant.
He was particularly taught,

14:45.125 --> 14:47.542
"You're going to a new country.
You follow the rules.

14:47.542 --> 14:51.209
And if you want to be
successful, you just take it."

14:51.209 --> 14:55.000
But that particular story,
I remember his fear.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.417
I remember seeing, like,
he had got into--

14:58.417 --> 15:00.209
he just, like, got into the car
and drove so far,

15:00.209 --> 15:02.584
and we were only a block
from our house.

15:02.584 --> 15:06.292
And that was really sad to see.

15:06.292 --> 15:09.792
My dad was so...

15:09.792 --> 15:13.959
The goodness
of my dad was...beyond.

15:13.959 --> 15:16.375
And it was sad.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.000
And it's not a unusual story.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.083
- Right.

15:19.083 --> 15:23.250
Well, I was really upset
when I found out, Crystal,

15:23.250 --> 15:25.709

experienced threats

15:25.709 --> 15:27.959

directed at you

15:27.959 --> 15:31.417
as a result of being on
the show because you're Asian.

15:31.417 --> 15:32.959
What do you want
to say about that?

15:32.959 --> 15:34.125
- I haven't shared
with you guys.

15:34.125 --> 15:36.250
It's hundreds a day.

15:36.250 --> 15:37.501
- Wow.
- Still?

15:37.501 --> 15:39.125
- Still.

15:39.125 --> 15:42.292
- Saying yes to doing the show,
primarily, the reason

15:42.292 --> 15:46.876
was because I thought
Asians need representation.

15:46.876 --> 15:48.334
- Yeah.
- So when I got the call,

15:48.334 --> 15:49.667
I thought,
"You know what? Like,

15:49.667 --> 15:51.375
"what an incredible opportunity

15:51.375 --> 15:54.083
"for me to do that

- Yeah.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.918
- You know, that was
my opportunity.

16:01.918 --> 16:06.959
So I thought,
"I'm gonna do it and...

16:06.959 --> 16:09.209
it's gonna be well received."
- Aw.

16:09.209 --> 16:11.918
- I'm just sorry for any part
that I played in that.

16:11.918 --> 16:14.167
- Thank you. I know.
- It's terrible.

16:14.167 --> 16:17.042
- It was so fun for me
and I think

16:17.042 --> 16:20.375
for the majority of people
watching to share your culture.

16:20.375 --> 16:22.042
I mean, you should feel
so great about it.

16:22.042 --> 16:23.125
- Yeah, you should.

16:23.125 --> 16:25.792
- And you shouldn't let
a percentage of assholes

16:25.792 --> 16:30.083
on social media define
not only your experience

16:30.083 --> 16:32.751
but the experience that
you put out there for others.

16:32.751 --> 16:34.501
- 100%.
- Absolutely.

16:34.501 --> 16:36.292
- I will say,
as much negativity

16:36.292 --> 16:37.751
has been out there,

16:37.751 --> 16:40.709
I am grateful
for every single person here,

16:40.709 --> 16:45.042
because everyone's been so open
and not only just accepting

16:45.042 --> 16:49.334
but, like, very excited
when I show my culture.

16:49.334 --> 16:52.876
And I'm obviously so proud
of my family and my background.

16:52.876 --> 16:55.959
And it's been a real pleasure.

16:55.959 --> 16:57.876

any of the other women

I felt so bad.

First of all, PK and Mo,

They have their own opinions.

- To add to that.
- Because we do care about you.

33:46.626 --> 33:49.375
- Because I was receiving
a new piece of information.

33:49.375 --> 33:50.792
And this was about your son.

PK.

34:05.167 --> 34:06.042

and confused.

it's the reason that people
are so fired up about this--

36:44.834 --> 36:49.584
