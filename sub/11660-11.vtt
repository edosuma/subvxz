(mellow music playing)

00:56.100 --> 00:59.633
-Morning, Ma. You sleep ok?
-No. I got up in the middle of the night,

00:59.700 --> 01:01.100
and there was a puddle in my bed.

01:03.834 --> 01:06.433
I was so relieved it was the roof leaking.

01:09.467 --> 01:12.500
Hi, Rose. The ceiling
in your room leaking, too?

01:12.567 --> 01:16.000
No. I just milked the cow
I keep in my closet.

01:18.100 --> 01:21.500
With only three hours' sleep,
I can be as bitchy as you.

01:23.233 --> 01:27.166
We have to do something
about the roof. It's getting worse.

01:27.233 --> 01:31.467
Blanche will wait for the ceiling to fall
before she'll do anything.

01:32.533 --> 01:35.000
Blanche, we really must
talk about the roof.

01:35.066 --> 01:37.467
Dorothy, I already called the repairman.

01:37.533 --> 01:40.667
Last night the ceiling fell on my bedroom.

01:41.266 --> 01:44.500
Knocked the Zorro mask
right out of poor Ed Rosen's hand.

01:45.967 --> 01:49.633
-(doorbell rings)
-That must be the roofer.

01:52.066 --> 01:55.033
-I'm Sid Labass. You called.
-Won't you come in?

01:55.100 --> 01:57.033
Wait. I stepped in something.

01:59.166 --> 02:00.266
That's good enough.

02:01.633 --> 02:05.200
I thank you for coming
on such short notice.

02:07.533 --> 02:09.667
You're lucky I came.
I got a horrible cold.

02:10.533 --> 02:13.400
I was so dizzy this morning,
I lost my balance getting out of bed.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.900
I guess my equilibrium shot!

02:14.967 --> 02:17.367
Well, I'm sure you'll feel better
once you're on the roof.

02:20.934 --> 02:25.100
I don't need to go up.
I saw it was a goner.

02:25.166 --> 02:28.100
Can't you patch it or something?

02:28.166 --> 02:31.900
I could patch it,
but that won't stop more leaks.

02:31.967 --> 02:33.567
What are you saying?

02:34.166 --> 02:35.567
You couldn't follow that?

02:37.433 --> 02:39.934
She has trouble following
<i>Murder, She Wrote.</i>

02:41.900 --> 02:45.333
-What's a new roof cost?
-10 thou.

02:45.400 --> 02:49.266
-How much is a patch job?
-A couple of hundred.

02:49.800 --> 02:54.700
-Look, can I use your phone?
-Go ahead. We have to discuss this.

02:59.900 --> 03:04.033
-We don't have $10,000.
-We can barely afford a patch job.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.333
Are we going to go without a roof?

03:06.667 --> 03:09.967
Maybe Sid will let us pay in installments.

03:10.033 --> 03:13.166
That's a great idea.
He's a reasonable man.

03:13.233 --> 03:17.033
Why wouldn't he go for it?
A new roof it is.

03:18.500 --> 03:22.100
That payment was due today,
not next Thursday.

03:22.166 --> 03:25.400
That check better be on my desk tomorrow
or you'll regret it.

03:25.900 --> 03:29.266
Understand? I'll talk to you later, dad.

03:33.567 --> 03:36.567
-What have we decided?
-Patch job.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.500
Fine. I'll do what I can.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.200
-Well, goodbye.
-Where are you going?

03:42.266 --> 03:43.867
I volunteer at the hospital.

03:43.934 --> 03:47.200
Oh, it's really sweet of you to volunteer.

03:47.266 --> 03:48.600
I like charity work.

03:49.033 --> 03:51.800
Besides, I've spotted
an eligible doctor for Dorothy.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.667
I hope he likes charitable work, too.

03:57.400 --> 04:03.367
I'm going to an art show tomorrow night.
I always meet eligible men at galleries.

04:03.433 --> 04:06.000
-Come with me.
-Can I come, too?

04:06.066 --> 04:08.233
Sure. It's a great show.

04:08.300 --> 04:11.033
It's featuring work by Jasper Dekimmel.

04:11.667 --> 04:13.834
-You ever heard of him?
-I'm not sure.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.900
Has he ever done anything in velvet?

04:18.266 --> 04:22.300
Jasper Dekimmel's art
hangs in museums all over the country.

04:22.367 --> 04:25.367
His paintings are worth
thousands of dollars.

04:25.867 --> 04:28.934
This is a Dekimmel
on this brochure for the exhibit.

04:31.967 --> 04:32.967
I don't get it.

04:33.300 --> 04:35.567
This kind of art does nothing for me.

04:35.633 --> 04:38.200
You have to open your mind
to new perceptions.

04:38.266 --> 04:40.900
It's nonrepresentational.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.233
I work in a museum,
so I understand these things.

04:44.300 --> 04:48.200
For instance,
this slash of red across the bottom

04:48.266 --> 04:50.266
represents the setting sun.

04:50.333 --> 04:53.934
This jagged blue line,
now, that signifies the ocean.

04:54.300 --> 04:58.667
This spot of orange here in the corner,
that stands for the planets

04:58.734 --> 05:02.233
and man's eternal struggle
against nature and the elements.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.567
No, Blanche.

05:03.633 --> 05:07.433
That's were I put my creamsicle down
when I answered the phone.

05:11.100 --> 05:12.667
See. It rubs right off.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.066
(serene music playing)

05:24.066 --> 05:26.233
Didn't I tell you tonight
was gonna be special?

05:26.300 --> 05:28.533
There's nothing but beautiful people here.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.266
I'm glad they didn't make us
check Dorothy with the coats.

05:33.367 --> 05:36.467
Look, Ma, I think I look
pretty damn good tonight.

05:36.533 --> 05:39.767
Is it really necessary for you
to constantly put me down?

05:39.834 --> 05:41.633
I'm sorry, pussycat, you're right.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.000
From now on, I'm gonna be
a more supportive mother.

05:44.967 --> 05:46.066
You look nice tonight.

05:46.667 --> 05:48.467
You look better than
a lot of other women here.

05:48.533 --> 05:53.200
-Like her, for instance.
-Thanks, Ma. By the way, that's a man.

05:54.967 --> 05:58.834
-Hey, that's not my fault.
-Girls, look. A mime.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.767
I just love a mime.

06:04.233 --> 06:07.633
It's all on account of my uncle Gustav.
He was a coal mimer.

06:11.867 --> 06:15.567
-You mean, a coal miner?
-No, a coal mimer.

06:15.633 --> 06:19.100
You see, he had a bad back and he didn't
wanna lose his medical benefits,

06:19.166 --> 06:22.600
so every morning he'd go down the shaft
and pretend to work.

06:29.934 --> 06:35.066
Hey, why are you wearing makeup?
So you mother won't be embarrassed?

06:36.967 --> 06:40.600
Honey, he won't pay any attention to you,
no matter what you do.

06:40.667 --> 06:41.700
Oh, yeah?

06:42.767 --> 06:44.767
Hey, fella, your fly is open.

06:52.767 --> 06:57.133
Girls. Girls, look.
<i>Self-portrait </i>by Jasper Dekimmel.

06:57.533 --> 06:59.834
Dorothy, that picture has three noses.

06:59.900 --> 07:03.400
Oh, I'm so glad
you find my self-portrait interesting.

07:03.467 --> 07:05.166
-You're him.
-Yes.

07:05.467 --> 07:08.367
Out of three noses,
why did you keep the biggest?

07:11.066 --> 07:15.100
All the galleries make that mistake.
They've hung it upside down.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.667
Oh, then those aren't noses.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.633
Whoa!

07:30.367 --> 07:35.200
Well... Mr. Dekimmel,
I find your work absolutely riveting.

07:35.266 --> 07:38.200
Well, so do I.
I just don't understand it.

07:38.266 --> 07:41.500
Of course. If you had any grasp of color,

07:41.567 --> 07:44.533
you wouldn't wear those shoes
with that dress.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.133
Just a minute here, Mr. Dekimmel.

07:48.200 --> 07:52.433
I see no reason to be insulting my friend
Rose or her shoes.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.700
Oh, my lord. Look at those things.

07:56.467 --> 07:59.367
The pilgrims landed in nicer shoes.

08:00.266 --> 08:04.166
Do forgive me, ladies.
My nerves get a bit jangled.

08:04.633 --> 08:07.266
Perhaps you'd care to discuss
one of my paintings?

08:07.333 --> 08:10.333
-That would be lovely.
-Shall we start here?

08:10.400 --> 08:14.633
You see how I echo Monet
with my brush strokes?

08:15.266 --> 08:16.800
(Dorothy, Rose and Blanche)
Yeah.

08:16.867 --> 08:19.934
How I show darkness with points of light?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.700
(Dorothy, Rose and Blanche)
Yes.

08:21.767 --> 08:27.100
And how I convey humor
with my cycle of blues and grays?

08:27.166 --> 08:29.600
-Oh, yes. Yes.
-Yes.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.100
You're idiots.

08:32.567 --> 08:37.367
The only humor here
is my own at your great stupidity.

08:37.700 --> 08:43.066
This picture no more echoes Monet
than any of you echo a beauty queen...

08:43.767 --> 08:46.600
and you'll waste no more of my time.

08:48.033 --> 08:51.100
-Oh, yeah?
-Go easy on him, Rose.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.233
What a terrible man.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.667
I know, but let's not
let him ruin our evening.

08:56.734 --> 09:00.300
-We can still enjoy all this art.
-Dorothy's right.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.967
Look, two more mimes
pretending to carry something.

09:06.567 --> 09:08.100
I'm gonna have some fun with them.

09:11.233 --> 09:14.700
(glass smashes)

09:17.800 --> 09:19.400
They weren't mimes, were they?

09:20.633 --> 09:26.934
(calm music playing)

09:27.000 --> 09:29.066
Rose, hurry. Please.

09:30.066 --> 09:34.633
-There were the only towels I could find.
-Put them around the bucket.

09:34.700 --> 09:39.100
Wait a minute, Rose.
Is that my Cabana club beach towel?

09:39.166 --> 09:43.533
-This one with the naked man and woman?
-Yeah. That's it.

09:44.100 --> 09:47.834
-Can't use this towel.
-Blanche, it's an emergency.

09:47.900 --> 09:51.266
-We'll replace it next week.
-You cannot replace this towel.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.867
There are too many memories
attached to it.

09:53.934 --> 09:59.266
I am in no mood to hear about
the parade of endless sexual encounters

09:59.333 --> 10:02.567
that you have experienced
up and down the Florida coastline...

10:03.166 --> 10:07.200
with only this towel between your hot
flesh and the cold, wet sand.

10:10.266 --> 10:15.000
I brought my son Skippy home
from the hospital in this towel, Dorothy.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.967
You're lying, Blanche.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.800
Damn, you're good.

10:26.700 --> 10:31.600
It wasn't all along the coast,
only fort Lauderdale during spring break.

10:31.667 --> 10:35.667
-Give me the towel.
-Oh, I hate that Sid Labass.

10:35.734 --> 10:39.433
He told us patching the roof
wouldn't work.

10:39.500 --> 10:43.333
We'll have to find the money
for a new roof.

10:43.400 --> 10:47.967
Oh, it's $10,000, Dorothy.
How will we come up with $10,000?

10:48.033 --> 10:53.700
Well, I hate to do it, but I have $2,000
in stock that I could cash in.

10:54.600 --> 10:58.533
-I could close my Christmas club.
-How much is that?

10:59.300 --> 11:02.533
Let's see. We're in January,
so this is week three.

11:04.600 --> 11:07.600
Then I have a retirement account.
That's about $4,000.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.500
I can borrow on my life insurance.

11:11.033 --> 11:13.767
-That should bring us close.
-It's settled.

11:13.834 --> 11:17.633
-We'll tell Sid to put up a new roof.
-Okay.

11:18.967 --> 11:24.333
Oh, Ma, you won't believe
what a terrible day we've been having.

11:24.633 --> 11:25.633
What are you telling me for?

11:25.700 --> 11:27.967
Think I'm hiding father Flanagan
under here?

11:32.367 --> 11:34.533
-I've got my own problems.
-What's wrong, Ma?

11:34.600 --> 11:36.633
Today's my worst day ever in a hospital,

11:36.700 --> 11:41.400
not counting the mistake Dr. Feldman made
during my gallbladder surgery.

11:42.867 --> 11:44.700
You ever try passing a sponge?

11:47.767 --> 11:49.166
What happened, Sophia?

11:49.233 --> 11:52.633
I got stuck with the meanest patient
in the history of medicine.

11:52.900 --> 11:55.600
Just because someone
has two weeks to live,

11:55.667 --> 11:57.367
he doesn't have to be cranky.

11:58.700 --> 12:03.567
Come on, Ma. The man is dying.
Have some sympathy.

12:03.633 --> 12:07.567
You met this Dekimmel character.
You try sympathizing with him.

12:07.633 --> 12:11.400
-Dekimmel? You mean Jasper Dekimmel?
-That's right. You got it.

12:11.467 --> 12:13.000
Pablo personality.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.934
Girls, listen.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.166
When a famous artist
like Jasper Dekimmel dies,

12:19.233 --> 12:22.633
the value of his work
doubles sometimes, even triples.

12:22.700 --> 12:26.066
-Know what that means?
-Sure. If he dies,

12:26.133 --> 12:28.800
his crummy pictures
will be worth a fortune.

12:28.867 --> 12:31.400
He'll have more money
than he'll know what to do with.

12:34.133 --> 12:35.967
You almost got it, Rose.

12:37.100 --> 12:41.033
They're auctioning off
some of Dekimmel's art this week.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.233
With inside information like this,

12:43.300 --> 12:46.200
we could make a killing
buying an original Dekimmel.

12:46.266 --> 12:51.500
We could sell the painting,
pay for the roof, and have money to spare.

12:51.567 --> 12:53.367
To buy whatever we want.

12:53.900 --> 12:56.166
Wait a minute. Hold on. Hold on.

12:56.233 --> 13:01.700
Come on. We're behaving like vultures,
like beasts of prey.

13:02.066 --> 13:05.567
Girls, come on. Dekimmel is a dying man.

13:05.633 --> 13:10.066
Do we really want to profit
from his misfortune?

13:11.300 --> 13:12.767
It would be immoral.

13:13.767 --> 13:15.233
We'd hate ourselves.

13:15.667 --> 13:17.233
What time's the auction?

13:19.900 --> 13:22.133
-8:00.
-We'd better get there by 7:30.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.767
We want good seats.

13:28.166 --> 13:33.233
(calm music playing)

13:33.300 --> 13:35.367
Ma, what are you doing in here?

13:35.433 --> 13:38.967
The searchlights were out,
so I tunneled out of my room with a spoon.

13:42.767 --> 13:44.800
I couldn't sleep,
so I'm having some tea...

13:44.867 --> 13:47.467
if that's ok with you,
prime minister Botha?

13:50.533 --> 13:54.367
I couldn't sleep either.
I had a terrible nightmare.

13:55.300 --> 13:58.266
Was it the recurring dream
where you're a lonely old woman,

13:58.333 --> 14:03.367
and your family puts you in a home
and never visits you?

14:03.867 --> 14:07.600
-That wasn't my dream.
-Yeah, right. That was my life.

14:09.233 --> 14:11.300
Ma, please. For the 100th time,

14:11.367 --> 14:14.233
shady pines was a beautiful
retirement village.

14:14.300 --> 14:15.767
Sure, sure.

14:15.834 --> 14:19.233
And Attica's known
for its topnotch tennis facilities.

14:21.867 --> 14:24.667
-What are you doing up?
-We're conducting a séance

14:24.734 --> 14:26.333
to contact Liberace.

14:28.900 --> 14:32.233
We couldn't sleep.
Why else would we be up at 4 am?

14:32.300 --> 14:35.800
I couldn't sleep either.
Probably something I ate.

14:35.867 --> 14:38.200
-What did you eat?
-Just the ordinary.

14:38.266 --> 14:42.467
A handful of snow caps,
a couple of devil dogs, some Oreos...

14:42.934 --> 14:47.133
and a ho-ho in a bowl
of fruit cocktail with heavy syrup.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.467
Couldn't sleep?
I'm surprised you didn't try

14:51.533 --> 14:53.667
to kill the mayor of San Francisco.

14:59.200 --> 15:03.433
Good morning, girls. I feel wonderful.
I had the best night's sleep.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.266
It's 4:00 in the morning.

15:05.734 --> 15:09.667
What? Oh, for heaven's sake.
I don't believe it.

15:10.066 --> 15:13.667
You know what happens
if I don't spend eight hours in bed?

15:13.734 --> 15:17.200
Iranian guys write their cousins back home
and tell them not to come?

15:19.233 --> 15:23.467
I simply cannot function the next day.
I always sleep like a baby.

15:23.533 --> 15:27.033
-How could this have happened?
-None of us could sleep.

15:27.467 --> 15:29.066
We all know why.

15:29.700 --> 15:30.834
Why?

15:32.667 --> 15:35.567
You are nothing if not consistent, Rose.

15:36.100 --> 15:39.700
Thank you, but hot water
and oat bran every morning

15:39.767 --> 15:41.400
takes most of the credit.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.500
No. I know what you meant.

15:52.767 --> 15:55.767
The reason we can't sleep
it's 'cause were feeling guilty

15:55.834 --> 15:59.166
about profiting from Dekimmel's
impending death.

15:59.233 --> 16:02.233
-I feel creepy thinking about it.
-Oh, me too.

16:02.300 --> 16:07.500
-why don't we just forget the whole thing?
-What? No one's calling anything off.

16:08.433 --> 16:10.367
It's not our fault the man is sick...

16:10.834 --> 16:15.900
that he's getting weaker by the hour,
that he needs a rare blood transfusion.

16:15.967 --> 16:20.033
-A rare blood transfusion?
-I overheard the doctors talking.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.133
In a day or two, he'll be plant food.

16:25.033 --> 16:27.066
It still doesn't feel right.

16:27.133 --> 16:28.533
Let me tell you a story.

16:29.533 --> 16:30.667
Picture it.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.900
Sardinia, 1932.

16:34.967 --> 16:38.200
I thought these stories
always took place in Sicily.

16:39.133 --> 16:40.800
Can't a person go away for the weekend?

16:44.567 --> 16:47.934
Anyway, I'm touring
the caper factories of Sardinia.

16:48.500 --> 16:51.633
I was a kooky kid
going through my Piccata period.

16:52.066 --> 16:54.834
A wedge of lemon
and a smart answer for everything.

16:56.967 --> 16:57.967
Anyway...

16:58.600 --> 17:04.000
I was... I was slicing an onion
when suddenly this big basil tree--

17:04.066 --> 17:07.533
What are you talking about?
You're not making any sense.

17:08.834 --> 17:11.500
I was hoping the late hour
would mask that.

17:12.734 --> 17:15.867
I don't have a story about taking
advantage of a dead guy for money.

17:16.533 --> 17:19.667
I got a story about a Moroccan
and a monkey...

17:20.500 --> 17:22.233
but that comes under lust.

17:27.166 --> 17:29.033
I'm really confused.

17:29.467 --> 17:31.867
Look. Life is tough.

17:31.934 --> 17:35.033
I'm not happy a fellow human being
is passing away...

17:35.333 --> 17:40.734
but if we don't make a few bucks,
somebody else will.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.834
All right. We're all in.

17:49.233 --> 17:52.734
Fine. Welcome to the George Bush era.

17:53.100 --> 17:55.233
Me. Me. Me.

17:59.533 --> 18:05.300
(serene music playing)

18:07.433 --> 18:08.667
Now, remember, girls...

18:09.300 --> 18:14.233
as far as anybody here's concerned,
Jasper Dekimmel is in perfect health.

18:14.300 --> 18:17.066
-Right.
-I'm surprised Jasper's not here.

18:17.133 --> 18:21.300
-He never misses an auction.
-Well, it's not because he's dying.

18:25.100 --> 18:27.266
Girls, the auction's about to start.

18:27.333 --> 18:29.867
Ladies and gentlemen,
the first item tonight

18:29.934 --> 18:32.867
is a fine example of Greco-Roman statuary.

18:33.367 --> 18:35.800
May I have an opening bid, please, of 20?

18:35.867 --> 18:38.433
Do I hear 25?

18:38.500 --> 18:41.633
Why are these statues
always of naked men?

18:41.700 --> 18:45.133
The Greeks and Romans always sculpted men.

18:45.200 --> 18:50.600
They admired the beauty of the male form,
its sinewy, muscled hardness,

18:50.667 --> 18:55.400
its rippling loins, its chiseled buttocks,
my, it's getting hot in here.

18:56.934 --> 19:00.667
-It certainly is.
-25. Do I hear 30?

19:00.734 --> 19:02.467
You made a bid.

19:02.934 --> 19:04.533
-How?
-You did this.

19:04.600 --> 19:09.533
-I have 35. Who will give me 35?
-Great, Dorothy.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.200
Relax, Blanche. It's only $30.

19:12.266 --> 19:16.767
-No, it's $30,000.
-$30,000! Just for doing this?

19:16.834 --> 19:20.233
I have 35. Who'll give me 40?

19:20.734 --> 19:21.934
Why did you do that?

19:22.000 --> 19:25.433
You'll need both hands
to pray someone bids 40.

19:25.500 --> 19:29.500
The bid is 35. Going once. Going twice.

19:29.567 --> 19:31.834
-40,000.
-Oh, thank God.

19:31.900 --> 19:35.066
Going once. Going twice. Sold.

19:37.266 --> 19:39.700
Look. Here comes the painting.

19:39.767 --> 19:42.900
Remember, 10,000 is our absolute limit.

19:42.967 --> 19:46.667
Next, <i>Community Property</i>
by Jasper Dekimmel.

19:47.133 --> 19:48.266
This is a small piece,

19:48.333 --> 19:51.934
but it will be worth
many times its current value someday.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.266
Like tomorrow.

19:56.734 --> 20:00.467
Keeping a secret
just isn't your strong suit, is it, Rose?

20:01.200 --> 20:05.934
-Let's not be overeager.
-No. Let's be very cool and laid back.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.900
We don't want to heat up the bidding.

20:08.967 --> 20:11.233
Who'll open the bidding at 5,000?

20:11.300 --> 20:12.767
(Rose, Dorothy and Blanche)
5,000.

20:14.734 --> 20:16.233
One at a time.

20:16.667 --> 20:19.300
I have 5,000. Do I have 6,000?

20:19.934 --> 20:24.266
-6. Who'll give me 65?
-Now, watch me.

20:24.333 --> 20:28.000
If you really play it cool,
you can scare off the other bidders.

20:28.066 --> 20:31.800
-6,500.
-Who will make it 7?

20:31.867 --> 20:35.033
-I have 7. Who will give me 75?
-My turn.

20:35.934 --> 20:37.000
75.

20:37.066 --> 20:39.700
Who will give me 8,000?

20:40.700 --> 20:43.433
-8,000.
-I have 8.

20:44.133 --> 20:48.333
Rose! What are you doing?
You just bid against us.

20:48.767 --> 20:51.567
Oh, I got carried away
with the cool part.

20:51.633 --> 20:54.333
-I could just smack you.
-85.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.700
-Give me that.
-I have 9.

20:57.600 --> 21:00.000
Going once. Going twice.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.467
Unless you ladies would like to pay more.

21:03.600 --> 21:07.767
-Sold. $9,000.
-Come on. Let's go call ma.

21:08.133 --> 21:10.266
(calm music playing)

21:10.333 --> 21:13.367
Ma, we own a Dekimmel!

21:13.867 --> 21:15.934
Although he was a terrible man,
I feel guilty.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.266
-Where do we send flowers?
-The yutz is going to make it.

21:21.700 --> 21:24.066
They found a donor
with his rare blood type.

21:27.767 --> 21:31.200
You save a guy's life, and all you get
is apple juice and a cookie?

21:37.166 --> 21:41.300
Dorothy, what did she say, honey?
What did she say?

21:42.033 --> 21:43.266
Dorothy.

21:44.233 --> 21:48.467
(mellow music playing)

21:48.533 --> 21:53.767
Oh, girls, let's stop moping.
That painting isn't so bad.

21:53.834 --> 21:57.100
If you stare at it long enough,
it almost looks good.

21:58.500 --> 22:01.300
I tell myself that
every week after <i>Thirtysomething.</i>

22:01.600 --> 22:03.066
It still gives me a headache.

22:04.900 --> 22:08.300
The important thing is, we didn't do
anything to feel guilty about.

22:08.367 --> 22:11.767
-Right. Ma saved a human life.
-(doorbell rings)

22:12.066 --> 22:13.567
Even if it put us in debt,

22:13.633 --> 22:18.567
and although he was
the most contemptible slug on earth.

22:19.934 --> 22:21.767
Look who's here, the runner-up.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.834
I'm here to get started.

22:25.266 --> 22:29.467
Sid, we can't afford
that new roof anymore.

22:29.533 --> 22:33.266
You can't afford a roof,
but you can afford that?

22:33.734 --> 22:34.967
-That's a Dekimmel, right?
-Yeah,

22:35.000 --> 22:38.100
that repulsive trash is an original
Dekimmel.

22:38.767 --> 22:43.166
-I've always wanted a Dekimmel.
-Don't you just love the technique,

22:43.233 --> 22:44.600
the use of color?

22:45.233 --> 22:48.300
Yeah. Yeah. I'd give anything
for a painting like that.

22:48.367 --> 22:52.367
-How about that painting for a new roof?
-You're kidding.

22:52.433 --> 22:56.533
Of course she's kidding.
I'd never part with this painting.

22:56.600 --> 23:00.900
-Sophia, are you crazy?
-Crazy about Dekimmel.

23:00.967 --> 23:05.133
Would you be insulted
if I made you an offer for that painting?

23:05.467 --> 23:07.633
I'm insulted by
that shirt you're wearing...

23:08.967 --> 23:11.700
but we can do business.
Talk to me, Sidney.

23:13.066 --> 23:16.133
A new roof with a five-year warranty.

23:17.333 --> 23:20.166
-And $2,500.
-In cash?

23:20.233 --> 23:22.000
No, in pistachio nuts.

23:24.133 --> 23:26.600
Of course cash. Today.
Tomorrow the price goes up.

23:26.667 --> 23:28.033
Dekimmel isn't getting any younger.

23:28.834 --> 23:33.700
-$2,500 seems a little steep.
-$3,000. You ticked me off.

23:36.266 --> 23:39.433
Now you're watching a real artist at work.

23:44.600 --> 23:50.433
(theme music playing)
