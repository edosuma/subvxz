They've already won. They're brothers again.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
You blockhead! That's not how you win!

And besides, as soon as she draws that Beast Snare,

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
they're done for.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
It's -- It's over.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
This is all my fault anyway.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
I should have played with you earlier.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
You're actually pretty smart, man.
