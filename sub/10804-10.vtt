WEBVTT

00:35.203 --> 00:37.371
- Christ almighty.

00:38.540 --> 00:40.166
What the hell happened here?

00:40.249 --> 00:41.459
Please.

00:42.335 --> 00:45.254
They need medical attention.
Please. Please.

00:45.338 --> 00:46.422
Thompson, help them.

00:48.049 --> 00:49.258
Got it.

00:52.804 --> 00:54.055
Daniel, look at me.

00:58.977 --> 01:00.562
Jesus Christ.

01:11.615 --> 01:13.992
Don't let any of 'em out your sight, okay?

01:14.075 --> 01:16.160
- Yeah, yeah.

01:16.244 --> 01:19.122
Okay, guys, come over here.
Um, I wanna make sure we cordon off...

01:22.834 --> 01:24.794
- ETA on the ambulances.
- They're two out, sir.

01:24.878 --> 01:29.799
I need five of 'em to...
54 St. Mark's, right away.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.138
Mahoney.

01:47.150 --> 01:49.694
Let me guess.
You're the one who found 'em.

01:49.778 --> 01:53.572
The cages, the medical tubing.
They were being drained.

01:53.657 --> 01:55.366
-For what?
-Doesn't matter.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.410
We need to find the people
who did this to them.

01:57.493 --> 02:00.204
It would be a good start
if you told me who that was.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.540
You see anyone down there?

02:05.334 --> 02:06.377
No.

02:08.797 --> 02:11.007
But you could start with the Yakuza.

02:11.090 --> 02:13.384
- "Start with"?
- Yeah.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.969
Shit!

02:15.053 --> 02:17.596
You saying the Yakuza
is mixed up with another group?

02:17.681 --> 02:19.849
- I think so.

02:19.933 --> 02:23.061
That's scarier than all this
cult-looking ritual shit put together.

02:24.688 --> 02:27.732
This group... they got a name?

02:27.816 --> 02:29.818
-I'm working on it.
-Yeah, I'll bet you are.

02:29.901 --> 02:32.445
Listen, these victims, they need
to be taken somewhere off the grid,

02:32.528 --> 02:33.655
somewhere they can't be found.

02:33.738 --> 02:35.531
No. What they need
is medical attention.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.241
I know, and they'll get it, but--

02:37.325 --> 02:39.327
Whatever was being done to them,
it may not be over.

02:39.410 --> 02:40.995
We need to get them somewhere safe.

02:41.079 --> 02:42.956
Yeah, that might not be a bad idea.

02:43.039 --> 02:44.290
All Saints is closest--

02:44.373 --> 02:46.042
No, take them to Metro-General.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.252
I know someone there we can trust. But...

02:49.170 --> 02:51.214
no one can know you're bringing them in.

02:51.297 --> 02:52.548
I'm on it.

02:53.466 --> 02:55.760
And just know, someday...

02:55.844 --> 02:57.553
I'ma tell you how to do your job.

03:12.736 --> 03:15.488
Thompson, I need a favor.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.867
Got the last one.

03:18.950 --> 03:21.452
And he's burning up.
I need a cooling blanket and ice packs.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.246
We're out.

03:23.329 --> 03:25.081
Jesus. Uh...

03:26.165 --> 03:27.250
Vending machine.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.586
Next floor down.
Get all the cold sodas you can.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.005
-Okay.
-Apply them on their wrists.

03:32.088 --> 03:33.339
We need to get the fever down.

03:33.422 --> 03:34.758
Thanks for this.

03:34.841 --> 03:36.259
Thank administration.

03:36.342 --> 03:38.594
They've taken six months
to remodel this wing.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.138
Anything happens, you let me know.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.348
I'll keep a few PD here,
and more downstairs.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.017
- Okay.
- And do me a favor?

03:44.100 --> 03:47.061
Keep the details
of this arrangement to yourself.

03:47.145 --> 03:48.980
Details?

03:49.063 --> 03:50.439
Our mutual friend.

03:51.482 --> 03:53.526
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

03:55.153 --> 03:57.405
This ain't like any overdose
I've ever seen.

03:57.488 --> 03:59.365
Yeah, their systems are in free fall.

04:00.825 --> 04:03.286
- Holy shit.
- What?

04:03.369 --> 04:04.578
She's got no prints.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.292
Her fingertips were burnt off.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.921
Her, too.

04:13.004 --> 04:14.630
IDing 'em is gonna be fun.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.340
What kind of junkies do this?

04:16.424 --> 04:18.551
Yeah, I think this was done to them.

04:20.053 --> 04:22.221
Let's just get them stable.
One headache at a time.

04:31.522 --> 04:33.191
You.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.193
And here I was hoping
my day would get worse.

04:35.276 --> 04:38.071
-Hi, Claire.
-Five patients, non-responsive,

04:38.154 --> 04:40.907
high fever, no fingerprints.

04:40.990 --> 04:43.242
You wanna tell me what kind of shit storm
you just rained down on me?

04:43.326 --> 04:44.702
It's why I'm here.

04:49.457 --> 04:50.708
In here.

04:53.837 --> 04:56.380
- What's the story?

04:56.464 --> 04:57.506
It's, um...

04:59.217 --> 05:00.259
it's complicated.

05:00.927 --> 05:02.386
Always is with you.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.638
Remember the last time you patched me up?

05:04.722 --> 05:06.640
When you were cut to shreds?

05:08.392 --> 05:10.561
Kinda hard to forget.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.396
Well, the same guy who did that to me,

05:12.480 --> 05:15.066
he's the one responsible
for your five new patients.

05:16.109 --> 05:17.276
Nobu.

05:18.194 --> 05:19.821
You said he burned to death.

05:19.904 --> 05:21.030
Yeah.

05:22.866 --> 05:24.283
I was wrong.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.998
There's gotta be more
to the story than that.

05:31.582 --> 05:33.292
For now...

05:33.376 --> 05:36.045
I need you to know that every one
of these people is still in real danger.

05:36.129 --> 05:39.507
Okay, I have checked their vitals.
I know, they're hanging by a thread.

05:39.590 --> 05:42.927
No. Claire, I mean...
even if you manage to save their lives,

05:43.011 --> 05:45.096
someone may still come to kill them.

05:45.638 --> 05:47.181
And the people who gave them aid?

05:47.265 --> 05:48.807
Most likely.

05:49.808 --> 05:50.851
Yes.

05:50.935 --> 05:52.896
Wow, Matt. I...

05:54.397 --> 05:55.648
I really have not missed you at all.

05:55.731 --> 05:58.859
But, look, Claire,
nobody knows they're here.

05:58.943 --> 06:01.404
And I'm gonna offer you
all the protection I can.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.448
Plus, you can still send them away.

06:05.992 --> 06:07.911
You know I can't do that.

06:07.994 --> 06:10.121
Thank you.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.497
It's why I came to you.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.876
Are you hurt?

06:17.711 --> 06:19.213
Yeah...

06:19.297 --> 06:20.381
a little.

06:20.464 --> 06:21.840
"A little"?

06:26.429 --> 06:27.805
Oh.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.515
That's...

06:29.598 --> 06:30.766
Bone bruise.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.102
A fractured rib, most likely.

06:33.186 --> 06:35.396
It's probably busted, knowing you.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.943
I'll say this about you,
Matt Murdock.

06:40.026 --> 06:42.070
You are a lot of bad things.

06:42.153 --> 06:44.238
Boring is not one of them.

06:45.864 --> 06:46.950
Here.

06:47.033 --> 06:49.452
-What is it?
-Two aspirin.

06:49.535 --> 06:51.162
Catholic morphine. Take it.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.496
I don't know.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.834
I'm...

06:56.917 --> 06:58.919
All units,
suspect Frank Castle.

06:59.003 --> 07:01.047
Believed to be
armed and extremely dangerous.

07:01.965 --> 07:04.008
I should've known
this day would get worse.

07:04.092 --> 07:06.510
I want this out across all five boroughs.

07:06.594 --> 07:09.347
And get some additional units
to the courthouse and City Hall.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.015
- Do it. Move!
- Son of a bitch.

07:11.099 --> 07:12.141
What is it?

07:13.351 --> 07:14.602
The Punisher.

07:15.979 --> 07:17.271
He just escaped.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.635
- Miss Page?
- Yeah.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.054
Agent Gallagher. Follow me.

08:31.137 --> 08:32.721
I'll get you through security
as quickly as possible.

08:32.805 --> 08:34.015
Thank you.

08:36.767 --> 08:39.103
Excuse us.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

08:39.187 --> 08:40.271
Sorry.

08:41.647 --> 08:42.731
Wait here.

08:42.815 --> 08:44.317
Hey.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.235
Guess I'm not the only one
that got Reyes's invitation.

08:46.319 --> 08:48.737
Security is nuts.

08:48.821 --> 08:51.199
Frank Castle's on the loose.
I wouldn't take any chances either.

08:51.282 --> 08:53.742
No, not even Frank could have
orchestrated an escape that quickly.

08:53.826 --> 08:55.994
How's that even possible?

08:56.079 --> 09:00.416
Guessing that's what the District Attorney
wants to ask us.

09:00.499 --> 09:02.626
This case just keeps serving up
the shit burgers.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.171
-Mr. Nelson, this way.
-See you on the other side.

09:05.254 --> 09:06.380
Yeah.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.304
Excuse me, sir.
Do you need a hand?

09:13.387 --> 09:15.348
No, thank you.
Thank you so much.

09:29.195 --> 09:32.740
I, uh, see Reyes... dragged you in, too.

09:32.823 --> 09:33.991
Karen?

09:36.244 --> 09:37.495
Are you all right?

09:37.578 --> 09:40.706
Other than being hauled in as a suspect
in the escape of a confessed murderer?

09:41.624 --> 09:42.750
Yeah, I'm great.

09:44.210 --> 09:46.504
Yeah, this whole case
has been a disaster.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.132
I'm sorry I pulled you guys into it.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.384
Don't be sorry.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.389
How are you otherwise?

09:56.472 --> 09:58.849
Good. Yeah, I'm good.

10:02.186 --> 10:03.354
Good.

10:03.437 --> 10:04.688
Miss Page?

10:04.772 --> 10:06.023
-Come with me.
-Yeah.

10:06.107 --> 10:07.691
Mr. Murdock, I'll be right back.

10:10.236 --> 10:11.654
According to my buddy,

10:11.737 --> 10:13.531
Reyes is most likely
about to grill us like fish.

10:13.614 --> 10:14.907
She has no cause.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.867
On paper,
we're still Frank Castle's attorneys.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.036
And I am so proud of that.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.289
Frank's out, but instead of
going after him herself,

10:21.372 --> 10:23.541
Reyes is dragging us
into the lion's den.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.460
What could we possibly
know about his escape?

10:26.544 --> 10:28.212
Precisely dick.

10:28.296 --> 10:30.839
But if Reyes can find a way
to blame us for all this, she will.

10:30.923 --> 10:32.800
Karen, you spent
the most time with him.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.177
He say anything?

10:34.260 --> 10:35.844
Anything at all
that could help us right now?

10:35.928 --> 10:38.181
Nothing about an escape.

10:38.264 --> 10:40.391
I went over Castle's transfer work.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.603
He wasn't waltzing into some country club.

10:44.687 --> 10:47.981
They were burying him
in their highest security control unit...

10:48.065 --> 10:50.276
with all the other rock stars
on cell block D.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.035
Uh, Matt... this way.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.332
Hey, Foggy.
You said cell block D?

11:04.415 --> 11:06.709
-It'll be just another minute.
-Thanks.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.085
Does that mean
something to you?

11:08.169 --> 11:11.297
Yeah, I like to keep track of the people
who might want to kill us.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.966
-The Punisher?
-No, not Frank. Wilson Fisk.

11:14.049 --> 11:17.052
Frank blows his trial,
and ends up on Fisk's cell block?

11:17.135 --> 11:19.263
And a day later, he's on the street.

11:19.347 --> 11:21.056
Uh, those are two very separate dots.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.808
-You can't just connect them.
-Oh, come on, Foggy.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.143
I'm right.
Fisk made this happen.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.565
She'll see you now.

11:31.567 --> 11:33.068
Ma'am?

11:33.777 --> 11:35.279
They're here now.

11:35.363 --> 11:38.782
Yes. As soon as possible.
Please, as soon as possible.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.286
Thank you for coming.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.373
Kinda hard to say no
when the cops pick you up.

11:45.456 --> 11:47.750
Well, I'm sorry about that.
Could you, uh--

11:47.833 --> 11:49.585
Please, have a seat.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.297
Please.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.467
The second chair.

12:02.014 --> 12:04.224
I don't know what your play is, lady,
but let's cut the shit.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.394
You brought us in expecting to sweat

12:06.477 --> 12:08.896
privileged information
about our client out of us.

12:10.939 --> 12:13.276
Yes... if that helps.

12:13.359 --> 12:16.445
We have to get Frank Castle off the street
before anyone else gets hurt.

12:16.529 --> 12:18.322
You're asking for favors,
after all the shit you've pulled?

12:18.406 --> 12:20.741
If you want our cooperation,

12:20.824 --> 12:22.868
then we need to know
what you know... all right?

12:22.951 --> 12:25.245
All of your cards on the table, right now.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.458
I've made mistakes.

12:31.335 --> 12:32.378
Excuse me?

12:32.461 --> 12:33.712
Central Park.

12:35.047 --> 12:37.466
Castle and his family.
I screwed up.

12:37.550 --> 12:40.052
Frank Castle's family
being gunned down

12:40.135 --> 12:41.345
is not a mistake, it's a massacre.

12:41.429 --> 12:43.972
Wait. I swear to God, if I had any idea
that people might get hurt,

12:44.056 --> 12:45.391
- I would not have done that.
- You--

12:45.474 --> 12:47.184
Your office were part of it?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.727
Why am I not surprised?

12:48.811 --> 12:50.604
They were more
than just part of it.

12:50.688 --> 12:51.855
It was a sting.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.441
How do you know that?

12:53.524 --> 12:56.569
I've gotten really good at digging up shit
people like you wanna keep buried.

12:56.652 --> 12:57.736
Hey, Karen. Just...

12:57.820 --> 12:59.947
-Probably not a good idea.
-Trust me.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.533
Ma'am... they need to know.

13:10.791 --> 13:14.044
Last year, the DA's office learned
there was a new player in the drug trade.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.879
Calls himself the Blacksmith.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.674
He wasn't gonna flood the market,
he was gonna be the market.

13:18.757 --> 13:21.885
And we were tracking kilos,
but this guy dealt in metric tons.

13:21.969 --> 13:25.931
Volume like that should have made him
easy to find, but he was a ghost.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.308
No sign of how he was getting
the product into the country,

13:28.392 --> 13:30.936
where it was coming from, nothing.

13:31.019 --> 13:35.023
Then one of the cops we planted
deep undercover got word

13:35.107 --> 13:38.611
that the Blacksmith was arranging
a meet between three unaffiliated gangs.

13:38.694 --> 13:41.279
Dogs of Hell, Kitchen Irish,
and the Mexican Cartel.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.323
Blacksmith wanted to broker a deal.

13:43.407 --> 13:45.993
They set the meet for Central Park,
midafternoon.

13:46.076 --> 13:48.746
Look, our guys were there.
They were ready.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.789
But the sting, it just, it...
it went south.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.625
You didn't clear the park, did you?

13:53.751 --> 13:55.878
I thought about it.

13:55.961 --> 13:58.381
But I decided an empty park
could show our hand.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.383
So, yes...

14:00.466 --> 14:02.885
I greenlit the operation...

14:03.844 --> 14:05.429
civilian traffic and all.

14:05.513 --> 14:08.474
And it, oh-so-predictably,
all went to shit.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.936
Blacksmith didn't show.

14:13.646 --> 14:16.148
Before we had a chance to move in...

14:16.231 --> 14:19.860
the gangs got rattled
and opened fire on each other.

14:20.819 --> 14:23.489
Our undercover was killed
and Castle's family--

14:23.572 --> 14:24.823
God damn it.

14:24.907 --> 14:28.744
So after that horrible decision,
you made it worse.

14:28.827 --> 14:31.872
You tried to kill him and ruin us
to save your own political ass.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.374
You know what, lady,
you're on your own.

14:33.457 --> 14:37.961
Wait, wait.
This is not about me anymore.

14:38.045 --> 14:41.715
I found this in my daughter's backpack
before sending her off to school.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.092
X-ray of a skull.

14:44.635 --> 14:45.719
Castle.

14:45.803 --> 14:48.221
You know once he gets his sights
set on a target, he never stops--

14:48.305 --> 14:49.848
- Where's your daughter now?
- Upstate...

14:49.932 --> 14:52.100
New York somewhere,
in a location I can never know about,

14:52.184 --> 14:56.063
surrounded by men with guns...
assigned to protect her.

14:57.690 --> 14:58.857
My baby girl.

14:58.941 --> 15:03.028
Ms. Reyes, it's highly unlikely
Frank Castle would target your family.

15:03.111 --> 15:06.323
I-- This is hard to understand,
but he has his own internal code--

15:06.407 --> 15:08.951
I'm sorry,
am I supposed to trust that?

15:10.160 --> 15:13.831
I don't care how much time you spent
in an interrogation room with him.

15:14.832 --> 15:16.166
He's coming after my child.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.418
What do you want from us?

15:17.501 --> 15:19.169
If he contacts you,
just let us know.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.838
You want us to break privilege?

15:20.921 --> 15:23.215
I wanna make sure that
nobody else gets hurt.

15:23.298 --> 15:24.717
Look, I...

15:25.676 --> 15:27.177
I know what I've done here.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.597
But please.

15:30.222 --> 15:32.850
I don't give a shit about my job anymore.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.478
- I just wanna keep my family safe.

15:35.561 --> 15:37.521
- Get down!

17:21.124 --> 17:22.250
How you feel?

17:24.002 --> 17:25.295
Like I've been shot.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.673
He says I'll be fine, though.

17:30.508 --> 17:31.885
Right.

17:31.969 --> 17:33.053
Matt, don't.

17:38.559 --> 17:40.686
-I have to find him, Foggy.
-Good idea.

17:40.769 --> 17:42.437
Strike now, while the police
have his whereabouts

17:42.520 --> 17:44.022
narrowed down to
the island of Manhattan.

17:44.106 --> 17:46.483
-I know where to start.
-You always know where to start.

17:46.567 --> 17:48.318
You just never know when to stop, Matt.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.154
I'm not asking for your permission.
All right? I'll see ya.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.825
Sorry.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.080
Hey. Where's Matt going?

18:01.498 --> 18:02.708
Why ask me?

18:14.261 --> 18:17.598
I spent nights looking
at Frank Castle's crime scenes.

18:17.681 --> 18:19.725
They look so different from the inside.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.935
You knew about Reyes and the cover-up
the whole time.

18:22.019 --> 18:23.771
I suspected.

18:23.854 --> 18:28.150
But the cover-up was well underway
before I started at the DA's office.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.069
But you don't get it.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.155
If it came out that civilians
were killed on her watch...

18:33.238 --> 18:35.783
a war hero, no less...
her career would have been over.

18:35.866 --> 18:37.575
Tower, she's dead now.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.707
I can't...

18:45.709 --> 18:47.585
Uh...

18:48.796 --> 18:52.424
She was altering medical records,
police reports.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.261
Getting sloppier every time.

18:56.344 --> 18:59.682
She was covering her tracks,
but the trail just kept spreading wider.

18:59.765 --> 19:02.309
And when I caught wind of it,
my hands were tied.

19:02.392 --> 19:03.601
It was... it was just too late.

19:03.686 --> 19:06.313
But I couldn't let myself
go down with her.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.023
So you slipped Karen the X-ray.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.401
Reyes ordered the DNR on Castle?

19:11.484 --> 19:13.195
His family was gone.

19:13.278 --> 19:15.823
Castle was hanging by a thread.
She just wanted the problem to go away.

19:15.906 --> 19:17.365
Well, it didn't.

19:17.449 --> 19:18.992
Castle didn't die.

19:20.703 --> 19:22.788
The man just murdered...

19:24.081 --> 19:27.960
a New York District Attorney,
and anyone who crossed him could be next.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.422
I'm sorry... I'm sorry for your loss.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.801
I'm gonna get the hell
out of town for a while.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.679
If I were you, I'd do the same.

19:44.977 --> 19:46.186
How bad is it?

19:46.269 --> 19:48.605
They're gonna take some X-rays,
just in case.

19:49.397 --> 19:52.150
-I'll come.
-No, that's okay.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.569
Really, I'm good alone.
I don't need you.

19:56.321 --> 19:58.490
Do me a favor. Watch your back.

20:14.297 --> 20:16.424
I'll need you to sign an affidavit...

20:16.508 --> 20:18.927
agreeing to our terms,
before you can see my client.

20:19.011 --> 20:20.345
Of course.

20:22.389 --> 20:23.515
It's in braille.

20:24.057 --> 20:28.061
Mr. Fisk requested that I accommodate
your... particular disability.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.398
He's a very thoughtful man.

20:34.777 --> 20:37.487
You will not come into
physical contact with Mr. Fisk.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.656
You will not discuss
your conversation with Mr. Fisk

20:39.740 --> 20:43.827
with any media outlet, government entity,
law enforcement agency,

20:43.911 --> 20:45.954
or outside party of any kind.

20:46.038 --> 20:50.000
Failure to do so will result in severe
financial penalties, detailed there.

20:51.126 --> 20:54.797
You will refer to Mr. Fisk
only as "Mr. Fisk,"

20:54.880 --> 20:59.009
and he will not answer any questions
until I personally approve of them first.

21:00.010 --> 21:01.469
- That's a lot of rules.

21:01.553 --> 21:04.765
Rules are what separate us
from the animals, Mr. Murdock.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.518
Thank you.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.481
Excellent.

21:20.823 --> 21:22.157
Straight ahead.

21:46.723 --> 21:48.141
On the left, sir.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.278
Mind the cane.

22:26.638 --> 22:29.307
You have ten minutes, Mr. Murdock.

22:36.773 --> 22:39.859
We met once before, you and I.

22:39.943 --> 22:42.154
Before you went after me in court.

22:43.947 --> 22:45.198
Do you remember?

22:46.116 --> 22:48.785
It was at an art gallery,
several months ago.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.579
I assume you've heard there's been
a shooting at the courthouse?

22:52.497 --> 22:54.124
Unfortunate news.

22:55.250 --> 22:57.044
But why does that send you to me?

22:57.127 --> 23:00.505
Because I know you facilitated
Frank Castle's escape.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.342
Why would I do that?

23:05.843 --> 23:08.596
Frank Castle's path and mine
are so clearly separate.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.015
Lack of motive.

23:11.599 --> 23:15.938
Enough to throw any rational
law enforcement agency way off your trail.

23:17.397 --> 23:18.606
But I'm not biting.

23:18.690 --> 23:19.899
Not biting.

23:20.817 --> 23:23.111
He's not biting, Donovan.
Barking!

23:23.195 --> 23:25.238
It's what you do.

23:25.322 --> 23:27.157
The scheming, the machinations.

23:28.116 --> 23:30.953
Frank Castle is a killing machine,
and you set him free.

23:31.036 --> 23:33.455
Which means you're aiming
a loose cannon at someone,

23:33.538 --> 23:34.706
and we both know it.

23:34.789 --> 23:36.541
And you can prove that in a court of law?

23:36.624 --> 23:37.792
Where is Frank Castle?

23:37.875 --> 23:39.169
Not here.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.967
Did you have anything
to do with his release?

23:45.050 --> 23:46.134
You don't have to answer that.

23:46.218 --> 23:47.719
No, I didn't.

23:48.803 --> 23:50.472
Clock's ticking, Mr. Murdock.

23:53.183 --> 23:55.935
These days are hectic in Hell's Kitchen.

23:56.019 --> 23:59.272
Lunatic shooters, gang wars.

24:01.649 --> 24:05.195
I understand you're frantic,
you're looking for answers.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.738
I have none.

24:10.283 --> 24:13.661
Sometimes I'm glad I'm... in here.

24:15.038 --> 24:17.915
The fate of New York City
is out of my hands for once.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.543
That's bullshit!

24:28.301 --> 24:30.553
I don't know what you expect from me...

24:32.597 --> 24:34.557
but we're finished here.

24:37.352 --> 24:38.686
Mr. Donovan.

24:44.026 --> 24:45.402
Vanessa.

24:48.030 --> 24:51.741
You asked me if I remember
the art gallery. I do.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.120
I remember her very well.

24:56.121 --> 24:57.205
Hmm.

24:58.123 --> 25:02.585
She's out of the country.
She, uh... wants to come back.

25:04.462 --> 25:05.755
Leave us.

25:15.307 --> 25:17.642
So listen to me very closely.

25:17.725 --> 25:18.726
Hmm.

25:18.810 --> 25:22.980
I will use every legal
loophole and footnote...

25:23.898 --> 25:26.025
to make certain that never happens.

25:29.446 --> 25:32.115
You see, unlike your
other adversaries, Mr. Fisk...

25:32.782 --> 25:35.452
I can break you without
breaking a single law.

25:36.619 --> 25:38.746
You may have expensive lawyers,

25:38.830 --> 25:43.042
but with one envelope and $6 postage...

25:44.211 --> 25:47.630
I can make sure Vanessa never
sets foot on American soil again.

25:48.715 --> 25:51.343
One letter to the right office...

25:51.426 --> 25:53.470
and I get her visa pulled.

25:55.972 --> 25:59.101
I can prove she was an accomplice
to every one of your crimes.

26:05.064 --> 26:08.067
And now you're thinking
you can serve your sentence,

26:08.151 --> 26:10.570
hop on a jet, go to her whenever you like.

26:11.988 --> 26:15.533
Live somewhere like Monaco, or...

26:15.617 --> 26:19.036
I don't know, wherever the hell
you fat cats go to sun yourselves.

26:19.121 --> 26:20.622
But you can't.

26:22.249 --> 26:26.043
You can visit her,
but you'll never live with her.

26:26.128 --> 26:30.132
Because this is New York, Wilson.
You live here.

26:30.215 --> 26:34.010
This is your jungle.
This is your blood, like it is mine.

26:36.221 --> 26:39.182
She will never come...

26:39.266 --> 26:40.892
and you'll never leave.

26:41.476 --> 26:44.437
You screw with me now,
just a little bit...

26:44.521 --> 26:48.566
and you'll never really be with your
one and only Vanessa ever again.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.408
Speak her name again!
Go ahead!

27:00.495 --> 27:02.497
Yes, the son of a boxer.

27:03.331 --> 27:04.957
You...

27:05.041 --> 27:06.709
You are running this place.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.211
Yeah, you did set him free.

27:08.295 --> 27:10.713
You ask such small questions,
Mr. Murdock.

27:10.797 --> 27:13.258
I know you're regaining power in here.

27:13.341 --> 27:15.885
Yes, ask my lawyer. He'll deny it.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.012
Ask the guards! They'll deny it.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.931
Ask the inmates here.

27:20.014 --> 27:22.225
They'll cut their tongues out
before they talk.

27:22.309 --> 27:24.894
But I have something to say to you.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.855
When I finally get out of this cage...

27:27.939 --> 27:32.652
I will dismantle the lives of the two
amateurs that put me in here!

27:33.570 --> 27:37.324
You, Mr. Murdock,
and Franklin Percy Nelson.

27:37.407 --> 27:39.451
No, I-- I put you here, not Nelson.

27:39.534 --> 27:40.577
-No.
-I did it.

27:40.660 --> 27:43.037
The two of you took the laurels.
You'll both take the blame.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.498
I'll chop both the heads
off of that snake,

27:45.582 --> 27:50.462
and I'll spend more than $6
on postage to bring you down!

27:50.545 --> 27:55.383
You see, I've had a lot of time to reflect
on my journey here, Mr. Murdock!

27:56.718 --> 28:00.763
My mistakes,
everything I took for granted.

28:00.847 --> 28:06.228
And while I try and sleep
in this bleak place...

28:06.311 --> 28:09.314
the one thing that keeps me warm...

28:10.565 --> 28:13.526
is the thought that I will
look down upon this city,

28:13.610 --> 28:16.696
the city that birthed me,

28:16.779 --> 28:20.617
with the woman that I love, who...

28:20.700 --> 28:24.454
whom I love with everything that I am.

28:24.537 --> 28:29.792
If you're worried that Frank Castle
will wreak havoc on Hell's Kitchen...

28:36.883 --> 28:38.343
...just wait.

28:45.933 --> 28:47.560
Time's up, Mr. Murdock.

28:49.229 --> 28:51.188
Okay.

28:52.189 --> 28:54.609
Let's do this again sometime.

29:26.349 --> 29:29.018
Mmm, okay, so everyone's
got somebody down there.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.937
Do we have anybody on the scene?

29:31.020 --> 29:32.939
I know we got Manus at Metro-General.

29:33.022 --> 29:35.191
Look, send Stantacki
down to the police department,

29:35.275 --> 29:37.277
and, Sarah, why don't you get
to the fire department, all right?

29:37.360 --> 29:39.529
We're gonna use the top one, okay?

29:39.612 --> 29:42.407
What are you guys looking at me for?
Will you just get to work?

29:44.784 --> 29:46.077
Holy shit!

29:47.119 --> 29:49.414
Karen.
Tell me you were there.

29:49.497 --> 29:50.957
-I was there.
-Yeah--

29:51.040 --> 29:53.668
Uh, well, do you need anything?
A med eval, maybe a blanket?

29:53.751 --> 29:54.877
Next dumb question.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.379
Hey, hey, will you just wait a minute?

29:57.630 --> 29:59.632
-So, was this Frank Castle?
-That's what I wanna figure out.

29:59.716 --> 30:00.758
-What does your gut tell you?
-No!

30:00.842 --> 30:03.135
No, my gut is the last thing I can trust.
I need facts.

30:03.219 --> 30:04.261
Okay, agreed.

30:04.346 --> 30:05.805
All right. So if Castle did this, if...

30:05.888 --> 30:07.474
-Uh-huh.
-...he's not gonna stop.

30:07.557 --> 30:09.392
Well, we gotta stay ahead of him here.
He took out the DA.

30:09.476 --> 30:10.518
No-- Allegedly.

30:10.602 --> 30:12.061
Fine. Who would be next on his shortlist?

30:12.144 --> 30:13.480
Whoever crossed him.

30:13.563 --> 30:15.482
I'm thinking a medical examiner
who falsified records?

30:15.565 --> 30:16.608
-Tepper.
-Exactly.

30:16.691 --> 30:18.610
He's probably still holed up
at that shit-ass motel.

30:18.693 --> 30:20.820
Right. So, I was gonna go over there now.

30:21.738 --> 30:22.989
Not alone, you're not.

30:27.702 --> 30:28.870
Let's go.

31:12.288 --> 31:13.581
Tequila.

31:14.499 --> 31:16.083
Mezcal, if you have it.

31:21.506 --> 31:23.257
Sounds great.
Same for me.

31:26.093 --> 31:27.429
Thank you.

31:31.433 --> 31:32.850
Thanks.

31:32.934 --> 31:36.479
Is that a French accent I hear?

31:36.563 --> 31:39.065
You tell me?

31:39.982 --> 31:41.275
The whole bottle, please.

31:50.827 --> 31:52.454
Another for the lady?

31:57.500 --> 31:59.251
Where are you headed?

32:02.171 --> 32:05.800
Far away. New York is over.

32:07.594 --> 32:10.555
Winter jacket. Gorsuch.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.976
Ski trip...

32:15.643 --> 32:16.686
Courchevel?

32:18.395 --> 32:23.818
Far too early for Courchevel,
and anyway I prefer St. Moritz.

32:24.986 --> 32:26.779
Shopping and slopes.

32:29.198 --> 32:33.077
For a start, both my feet hurt
after a while. I'll need a bath.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.704
I can draw one for you.

32:39.917 --> 32:42.294
In a tub for two?

32:42.378 --> 32:43.546
But of course.

32:44.421 --> 32:45.882
How nice.

32:47.258 --> 32:49.176
I get so lonely.

32:49.927 --> 32:51.303
I guarantee that will not be a problem.

32:52.555 --> 32:53.723
You're a gentleman.

32:54.223 --> 32:55.975
Not always.

32:56.058 --> 32:57.560
Good.

32:58.895 --> 33:02.398
New York is done.
Hello to...?

33:02.899 --> 33:04.484
Jacques.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.318
Jacques Duchamps.

33:06.402 --> 33:07.612
Louise Badeaux.

33:09.739 --> 33:12.950
Louise. Funny...

33:16.078 --> 33:17.747
I thought your name was Elektra.

33:20.542 --> 33:22.001
How do you know my name?

33:23.586 --> 33:25.004
I know who you are.

33:25.755 --> 33:28.633
I know what you've done,
and who you have killed.

33:28.716 --> 33:30.259
The list is long.

33:31.010 --> 33:34.096
The pilot in Buenos Aires,
the lawyer in Berlin...

33:34.180 --> 33:37.224
and that very messy episode in Morocco.

33:38.017 --> 33:40.895
I'm still trying to understand
how one woman

33:40.978 --> 33:44.190
can fit six bodies
in the trunk of a Maserati.

33:47.193 --> 33:49.111
Are you gonna try to kill me?

33:50.697 --> 33:52.114
Something like that.

33:54.408 --> 33:55.827
Well, you ought to know...

33:58.955 --> 34:00.957
it's rude to keep a girl waiting.

34:24.939 --> 34:26.232
Just one body.

34:26.315 --> 34:28.860
Shit-ton of bullets,
and a whole lot of blood.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.113
All signs point to Frank Castle.

34:32.196 --> 34:34.323
-No, no. Uh, it's not his style.
-Wait, wait, wait.

34:34.406 --> 34:35.617
No, really, I, I know him.
He wouldn't--

34:35.700 --> 34:37.702
What do you mean, "Not his style"?
Come here...

34:37.785 --> 34:41.956
Look, you wanna report the news,
or you wanna really get to the truth?

34:42.039 --> 34:44.626
The first step is you gotta
put aside your personal feelings.

34:44.709 --> 34:47.962
I-- I mean about everything.
No matter how much it hurts.

34:48.045 --> 34:50.590
This is not personal.
I'm just saying that this does not fit.

34:50.673 --> 34:52.925
All right, this is just--
That's just out of control.

34:53.009 --> 34:56.846
Yeah, it's out of control because
Frank's a killer, all right? That's chaos.

34:57.847 --> 35:01.142
Whatever good you saw,
whatever...

35:01.225 --> 35:05.062
you know, code of honor
that you understood...

35:05.647 --> 35:06.981
it was never there.

35:09.901 --> 35:11.694
-You think I projected?
-Yeah.

35:12.695 --> 35:14.614
Happens to the best of us.

35:14.697 --> 35:16.658
Although, you know, why you'd
wanna see good in the man

35:16.741 --> 35:20.077
- who pulls the trigger is...
- beyond me, but...

35:22.496 --> 35:24.498
Do you know anybody else
who might be in danger?

35:25.416 --> 35:27.251
Um...

35:27.334 --> 35:29.879
Yes, uh, his nurse.
Uh, he's a janitor now.

35:29.962 --> 35:31.463
-And there's some others.
-Okay, okay. So-- So, listen.

35:31.547 --> 35:33.257
You gotta... you gotta
get those names, all right?

35:33.340 --> 35:35.843
We have to hand
everything we have to the NYPD.

35:35.927 --> 35:38.054
We need to save
as many people as we can.

35:38.137 --> 35:40.306
Yeah. I've got all the files
at my apartment. I could go right now.

35:40.389 --> 35:42.224
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

35:45.895 --> 35:47.730
Guys, can you come here?

35:51.108 --> 35:52.819
--Uh, what's this?

35:52.902 --> 35:56.113
Oh, well, they're, um...
they're going with you.

35:56.197 --> 35:57.614
-Are you serious?
-Mmm, yeah.

35:57.699 --> 35:59.867
Yeah, I had one last string to pull,
so don't screw it up, okay?

35:59.951 --> 36:02.369
No, Frank's not gonna hurt me.

36:02.453 --> 36:03.746
Frank's a psycho killer.

36:03.830 --> 36:05.707
You would never have pulled this
patriarchal shit with Ben.

36:05.790 --> 36:07.208
I can take care of myself.

36:07.291 --> 36:08.500
You're right.

36:08.584 --> 36:10.712
And I'll never make that mistake again.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.173
Not about someone I care about.

36:16.843 --> 36:18.552
-Okay.
-Go, go, go.

36:18.635 --> 36:20.304
Get the files.

36:20.387 --> 36:22.098
Meet me back at the office in an hour.

36:22.181 --> 36:23.933
Yeah. I'll be there.

36:25.267 --> 36:27.353
Don't forget you owe me a cup of coffee!

36:50.667 --> 36:51.794
Where am I?

36:52.712 --> 36:54.380
Hey.

36:54.463 --> 36:56.883
You're in Metro-General,
and you're safe.

36:58.134 --> 36:59.343
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

36:59.969 --> 37:02.429
Lie very, very still.
You've been very ill.

37:03.430 --> 37:04.891
Do you remember what happened?

37:10.437 --> 37:11.814
Can you feel this?

37:14.316 --> 37:15.442
Good.

37:15.526 --> 37:16.736
Daniel.

37:17.987 --> 37:19.196
Your father's here.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.572
Thank you.

37:21.407 --> 37:23.034
Is he okay?

37:24.118 --> 37:27.038
Yeah. He's weak,
and he'll need another transfusion,

37:27.121 --> 37:28.330
but he's coherent.

37:28.414 --> 37:30.917
Hopefully the others
will respond the same way.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.376
I don't know how to repay you.

37:32.459 --> 37:35.171
Trust me,
billing will find you.

37:37.006 --> 37:39.591
I'll give you two a minute to catch up,

37:39.675 --> 37:42.428
but then the police will be wanting
to question him sooner than later.

37:42.511 --> 37:44.013
Yes, of course.

37:50.352 --> 37:53.773
I'm... so sorry.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.192
This is all my fault.

37:57.193 --> 38:00.446
I promise... it's going to be better now.

38:09.246 --> 38:11.207
Always the last place you look.

38:13.334 --> 38:15.169
But you knew I was coming, huh?

38:16.253 --> 38:17.629
I heard you.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.049
Three stories down.

38:20.132 --> 38:22.718
You do know
that sounds creepy, right?

38:24.511 --> 38:27.098
- Yeah, I've been told.

38:27.181 --> 38:28.557
I brought you coffee.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.934
No, thanks.

38:31.853 --> 38:34.605
Right. Forgot, you like to suffer.

38:37.233 --> 38:39.401
Well, the joke's on you...

38:39.485 --> 38:41.821
'cause our vending machine
coffee really sucks.

38:48.785 --> 38:49.954
Thought you'd be with your friend.

38:54.333 --> 38:56.293
Aren't you gonna ask me
how he's doing?

38:57.753 --> 38:59.922
He's fine.
He's watching the game.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.758
Jets are up, seven-nothing.

39:04.343 --> 39:06.220
Ah, he just changed the channel.

39:07.554 --> 39:08.973
The hit was clean.

39:09.556 --> 39:10.599
In and out.

39:11.517 --> 39:13.019
They'll release him tomorrow.

39:17.189 --> 39:19.942
You know, the bullet wound will
do wonders for his career in hip-hop.

39:23.445 --> 39:24.821
You should pay him a visit.

39:24.906 --> 39:26.866
I can't help him, Claire.

39:26.949 --> 39:28.284
How do you know that?

39:28.367 --> 39:30.452
-'Cause he got shot.
-Not by you.

39:30.536 --> 39:32.454
No, but I dragged him into this mess.

39:32.538 --> 39:35.082
Maybe. Maybe...

39:36.000 --> 39:40.212
Or maybe you need to start thinking about
climbing down off that cross of yours,

39:40.296 --> 39:43.465
and spending some time
with us normal people for a change.

39:47.511 --> 39:48.888
How are the other patients?

39:48.971 --> 39:51.432
Alive... thanks to you.

39:52.433 --> 39:54.226
You brought them in just in time.

39:55.144 --> 39:56.938
And one's awake.

40:00.482 --> 40:01.817
What do they remember?

40:01.901 --> 40:04.028
Nothing yet.
He's in and out.

40:04.111 --> 40:07.489
But I got all their toxicology screens
back from the lab, though,

40:07.573 --> 40:11.035
and they read like a cheap
science-fiction novel.

40:11.118 --> 40:12.869
What's the report?

40:12.954 --> 40:16.748
Eight separate unidentified
organic substances in their bloodstreams,

40:16.832 --> 40:19.543
or what was left of their bloodstreams.

40:19.626 --> 40:22.421
-What do you mean?
-They didn't just lose blood...

40:22.504 --> 40:24.423
they were drained.

40:24.506 --> 40:25.716
All of them.

40:25.799 --> 40:29.845
Each bled, carefully, systematically...

40:30.762 --> 40:32.139
probably for several months.

40:32.223 --> 40:35.767
Yeah. Nobu took blood out,
but you're saying he put toxins in?

40:35.851 --> 40:36.978
One of our doctors thinks that

40:37.061 --> 40:42.024
maybe they were being used to incubate
the substances in their systems.

40:42.108 --> 40:44.110
- Like human chemical farms...
- Jesus.

40:44.193 --> 40:46.070
...that could be tapped as needed.

40:49.448 --> 40:51.283
God!

40:51.367 --> 40:53.410
I should have stopped this.

40:54.495 --> 40:55.912
You know you kind of did, right?

40:55.997 --> 40:57.498
Yeah, not soon enough.

40:59.708 --> 41:01.168
I don't believe this.

41:06.298 --> 41:08.134
Hey, uh, St. Matthew...

41:08.217 --> 41:10.261
enough with the hair shirt, already.

41:10.344 --> 41:12.471
You know, we've got doctors on it.

41:12.554 --> 41:14.390
Cops, labs...

41:14.473 --> 41:16.392
You're not the only person
in Hell's Kitchen

41:16.475 --> 41:18.602
who gives a shit about
what's going on here.

41:20.896 --> 41:22.773
You look like hell,
you know that?

41:22.856 --> 41:26.068
And you're standing up here,
freezing your ass off playing guard dog

41:26.152 --> 41:29.155
when what you really need
is probably three days' sleep.

41:29.238 --> 41:32.324
Yeah, 'cause Nobu's gonna figure
out where we are.

41:32.408 --> 41:34.493
And when he does,
I wanna be here.

41:35.411 --> 41:36.537
Of course, you do.

41:36.620 --> 41:38.830
Claire, what do you...
what do you expect from me, all right?

41:38.914 --> 41:40.541
I'm flailing here.
A dead guy...

41:40.624 --> 41:44.961
A guy I witnessed burned to death,
is somehow back in Hell's Kitchen.

41:45.504 --> 41:47.548
All right? On top of that,
Frank Castle kills the DA,

41:47.631 --> 41:49.800
and Wilson Fisk runs the prison
that I sent him to.

41:49.883 --> 41:51.343
How do you know that?

41:53.554 --> 41:54.721
I went there.

41:58.017 --> 41:59.518
Busy boy.

42:01.437 --> 42:05.066
Oh, jeez.
I thought it could work. I did.

42:05.982 --> 42:07.776
The law...
But it feels useless.

42:07.859 --> 42:10.029
Everything I do just gets undone.

42:12.364 --> 42:15.951
You're talking to someone who patches up
the same three crackheads every night.

42:16.035 --> 42:19.455
I understand what it's like to be pulled
in a hundred different directions at once.

42:19.538 --> 42:21.415
Not like this.

42:21.498 --> 42:22.791
I'm done, Claire.

42:24.876 --> 42:27.671
No more law. No more friends.

42:28.922 --> 42:30.841
At best, they're a distraction.
At worst...

42:31.675 --> 42:33.052
I put them in jeopardy.

42:36.388 --> 42:38.182
From now on, I need to focus.

42:40.059 --> 42:42.353
You may feel like
you are a ship lost at sea,

42:42.436 --> 42:45.397
but if you isolate like this,
then you really will be.

42:46.357 --> 42:48.192
You're cutting off your own anchor.

42:48.275 --> 42:49.568
Yeah.

42:50.486 --> 42:56.283
And every minute that you spend...
standing, hiding in this suit of armor,

42:56.367 --> 43:00.287
the more separate you become from
the very things that you wanna protect.

43:00.371 --> 43:03.457
Your friend is in
a hospital bed downstairs.

43:06.793 --> 43:09.838
Stop playing the loneliest little soldier,
and come downstairs.

43:09.921 --> 43:14.009
Be a human being...
and come say "hi."

43:15.969 --> 43:17.929
That's all you gotta do.

43:24.103 --> 43:25.271
Come on.

43:33.069 --> 43:34.571
Matt?

43:35.989 --> 43:37.491
Thanks for the coffee.

43:58.137 --> 43:59.305
Clear.

44:07.979 --> 44:09.190
You live alone?

44:10.106 --> 44:12.359
You wanna ask me out,
or you wanna wait outside?

44:43.807 --> 44:45.100
Officers?

44:48.520 --> 44:49.688
Hello?

45:13.670 --> 45:15.213
Hands on your head, Frank.

45:16.340 --> 45:17.841
--I mean it.

45:17.924 --> 45:18.967
It wasn't me.

45:19.050 --> 45:22.596
Hands on your head or I will
unload this thing, I swear to Christ!

45:23.764 --> 45:24.973
It wasn't me.

45:26.767 --> 45:28.059
Do it.

45:28.644 --> 45:30.937
Okay. Okay.

45:31.980 --> 45:33.231
Hey.

45:53.919 --> 45:56.171
Jesus Christ!

45:56.254 --> 45:58.089
You believe me now?

45:58.173 --> 45:59.508
I believe you.
I believe you.

45:59.591 --> 46:00.717
Okay.

46:00.801 --> 46:02.928
--You gotta get out of here.

46:03.011 --> 46:04.305
Stay low.

46:04.388 --> 46:06.056
Go, stay low.

46:43.552 --> 46:44.595
Miguel?

46:45.846 --> 46:46.930
Yes, Mr. Fisk?

46:48.932 --> 46:51.142
I'd like you to call Mr. Donovan.

46:51.226 --> 46:54.521
I'd like to reexamine
Matthew Murdock's files.

46:54.605 --> 46:55.897
Yes, sir.

48:18.271 --> 48:20.315
--Listen to me, asshole.

48:21.274 --> 48:24.611
I don't care what the Hand wants,
with me or anyone else.

48:24.695 --> 48:26.697
This is not my war.

48:26.780 --> 48:29.533
The Hand didn't send me.

48:31.702 --> 48:33.036
Stick did.

49:02.023 --> 49:03.609
Great. Now what?

49:36.600 --> 49:39.102
Hey. What are you--

49:45.400 --> 49:47.653
Oh, my God.
What did you--
