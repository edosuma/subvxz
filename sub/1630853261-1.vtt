00:14.180 --> 00:16.850
Hi, I'm Cassie,
and I'm an alcoholic.

00:16.933 --> 00:18.184
Hi, Cassie.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.019
Most of you know
my story by now.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.772
Um, since I quit drinking,
I've been making changes.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.274
I moved to LA.

00:31.656 --> 00:33.491
- Started dating
this great guy, Marco.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.244
Picked up a part-time job.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.923
But I'm still flying.
I'm still a flight attendant.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.762
But I feel like I'm turning
into this whole other person,

00:53.845 --> 00:56.681
like, in a really good way,
you know?

00:56.765 --> 00:58.892
And I know what they say about
moving too fast,

00:58.975 --> 01:02.395
you know, no big life changes
in the first year, but,

01:02.479 --> 01:05.815
I'm two days away
from being a year sober.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.401
I'm really excited, and I know,
one day at a time and all,

01:08.485 --> 01:12.113
but I gotta tell you,
just, my life and everything,

01:12.197 --> 01:14.616
it just all feels...

01:14.699 --> 01:16.075
pretty great.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.369
- Thanks.

01:24.709 --> 01:26.169
Yeah, in the back.

01:26.252 --> 01:29.088
- Hi, Ted, alcoholic.
-Hi, Ted.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.632
I was just sitting here
thinking,

01:30.715 --> 01:32.050
I remember
early in my recovery,

01:32.133 --> 01:33.301
that fucking pink cloud,

01:33.384 --> 01:35.428
where I was kind of just

01:35.512 --> 01:38.640
stupidly naive
and thought everything was

01:38.723 --> 01:40.642
- "pretty great."
- What's that there, Ted?

01:40.725 --> 01:42.519
Uh, no crosstalk, Cassie.

01:42.602 --> 01:43.645
I know, but he just took--

01:43.728 --> 01:45.355
- Okay?
- Right.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.857
A reminder to everyone--

01:47.941 --> 01:49.609
we don't
interrupt people's shares.

01:56.241 --> 01:59.202
Look, I know it's "principles
before personalities,"

01:59.285 --> 02:00.662
but that guy was a dick.

02:00.745 --> 02:02.330
- He was being a dick.
- Yeah.

02:02.413 --> 02:04.082
Thank you. And I ran out
of Hot Tamales.

02:04.165 --> 02:06.125
My body is still craving sugar
every single day.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.877
I'm not saying I'm gonna
eat all these donuts

02:07.961 --> 02:09.337
but I'm definitely gonna
eat all these donuts.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.381
The curse of giving up booze.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.842
You're my sponsor.
Say something wise.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.469
I thought I was acing
recovery once,

02:16.553 --> 02:18.221
until I burned my house down.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.556
Jesus, Brenda,

02:19.639 --> 02:21.182
why does
every one of your stories

02:21.266 --> 02:22.725
have to end in
some horrific trauma?

02:22.809 --> 02:24.018
I'm your sponsor
because it helps me

02:24.102 --> 02:25.728
with my own recovery.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.523
If you want to eat the donuts,
eat the donuts.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.733
Thank you for that advi--Hi.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.819
Your share today
really touched me. I just...

02:32.902 --> 02:34.654
- wanted to say hi.
- Aw!

02:34.737 --> 02:36.739
Oh, my God, my boyfriend
would love your necklace.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.908
No, I love your necklace.
I think my boyfriend--

02:38.992 --> 02:40.660
I'm working on being
less codependent.

02:40.743 --> 02:43.538
It's okay. Don't apologize.
I--we're here

02:43.621 --> 02:45.915
because we're working
on things, right?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.418
It's Jenny, right? I'll tell you
where I got it if you want.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.211
I'll go get my phone.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.755
Wow. You've got a newbie
crushing on you.

02:52.839 --> 02:53.923
Mm-hmm.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.592
Ready to be a role model?

02:55.675 --> 02:57.802
Yes. Yes, I am.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.914
Okay. Mysterious envelope.
Great.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.753
- Hey.
- Hello.

03:33.004 --> 03:36.424
Putting that house key
to good use, huh?

03:36.507 --> 03:38.301
- How was your meeting?
- Um, it was good.

03:38.384 --> 03:41.137
I--I got called out
for crosstalk.

03:41.220 --> 03:43.306
- Uh-oh. Well,
- Yeah.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.308
your crosstalk is what
first attracted me to you.

03:45.391 --> 03:46.935
Really? That's so weird.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.269
I thought it was my legs
that you kept staring at.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.354
Hi!

03:50.980 --> 03:52.148
Hi.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.777
Uh, but it was good.
You know, I got to share,

03:55.860 --> 03:57.987
and, um,

03:58.071 --> 04:01.491
I don't know, I feel like
I'm in, like, a good place.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.242
- How was your shoot?
- Long.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.161
Some energy drink. I mean,

04:05.244 --> 04:07.163
how many ways can you
photograph a can?

04:07.246 --> 04:08.665
Turns out, 72.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.334
Seventy-two!
I was just gonna say that.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.753
My question for you is,

04:13.836 --> 04:15.505
when do I get to
photograph you again?

04:16.422 --> 04:19.300
Oh, come on. Nothing's gonna
be as good as this one.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.135
I mean, I just--
I love this one.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.012
I love the energy of it,
you know?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.639
I mean,
aren't you into it? Like...

04:24.722 --> 04:28.476
"dinner can wait" into it,
into it?

05:08.266 --> 05:10.685
Oh, my God,
LA traffic is insane,

05:10.768 --> 05:11.978
but I am not late.
Mark that down

05:12.061 --> 05:13.438
in your little notepad.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.064
If you're not early,
you're late.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.816
Okay, Benjamin,
that is an impossible bar

05:16.899 --> 05:18.359
I will never be able to reach.
Also, why are we

05:18.443 --> 05:19.861
in a parking deck?
- The office

05:19.944 --> 05:21.696
picked it
for your convenience.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.072
I would've picked Hollywood
Park Off Track Betting.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.866
Oh, you're a gambling man.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.576
I'm learning little bits
and pieces about you.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.328
Here's a photo of your mark
in Berlin.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.205
His name's Will Kotov.

05:31.289 --> 05:33.082
Okay, we've been handler and
asset for a few months now.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.917
Shouldn't I know just
a little more about you?

05:35.001 --> 05:36.419
No.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.088
So we would like you
to observe him

05:39.172 --> 05:40.757
on site at the hotel only.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.550
- Did you catch that last part?
- Yeah.

05:42.633 --> 05:43.926
- Look at me, please.
- I'm looking at you.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.762
On site in the hotel only.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.930
That means do not follow,
do not engage.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.266
"Do not follow,
do not engage." Got it.

05:50.349 --> 05:51.768
You do good work, Bowden.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.936
But we both know you have
a habit

05:54.020 --> 05:55.855
off getting too involved
with your marks.

05:55.938 --> 05:57.690
Okay, that is quite the
exaggeration, don't you think?

05:57.774 --> 05:59.859
- Tokyo? Madrid?
- Okay. No, no, that--

05:59.942 --> 06:01.736
What about that absolutely
insane stand-off

06:01.819 --> 06:03.738
you got in a Moscow restaurant
you had to flee?

06:03.821 --> 06:05.782
That was not my fault, okay?
That was an impulse thing.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.575
No, scratch that. That
sounded bad. No, it wasn't.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.452
I just--I don't
get a lot on these people.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.038
I get a photo and a name,
and I'm very curious.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.790
- Isn't that part of my job?
- Bowden,

06:13.873 --> 06:15.458
if you have
an operational issue

06:15.541 --> 06:17.502
- with the way the CIA assigns--
- I don't.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.754
No, no, I don't. I just--
I like to go above and beyond,

06:19.837 --> 06:22.673
and sometimes in the moment,
I get a little...

06:22.757 --> 06:23.966
- I'll stop you there.
- Yeah, you should.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.802
You're not a CIA officer.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.178
You are a civilian asset,

06:27.261 --> 06:29.055
emphasis
on the word "civilian."

06:29.138 --> 06:30.765
Please remember that
for your safety.

06:30.848 --> 06:33.392
Benjamin, I hear you,
and I get it, I promise.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.145
Commit that photo to memory.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.688
I know that you carry them
on you

06:37.772 --> 06:38.898
and that's a really bad idea.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.316
Consider it memorized.

06:40.399 --> 06:41.651
Wait, hold on.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.194
Now consider it memorized.

06:43.277 --> 06:44.612
Just tell me one more thing
about you.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.155
It'll really help my process.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.365
Do you have a dog?
Do you have a cat?

06:47.448 --> 06:48.825
Where do you live?

06:48.908 --> 06:51.452
Are you married?
Girlfriend? Boyfriend?

06:51.536 --> 06:52.912
Come on.

07:03.756 --> 07:06.300
Well, well, well.
Hello, gorgeous.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.010
Hello, beauty.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.554
You know, I have been seeing
you a lot at LAX lately.

07:09.637 --> 07:10.847
Are you stalking me?

07:10.930 --> 07:12.765
I took a trans-Pacific route.

07:12.849 --> 07:14.934
I am seeing all of the sights.
I'm eating all of the fish.

07:15.017 --> 07:16.519
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm, and doing

07:16.602 --> 07:18.271
the secret work
that's a secret job

07:18.354 --> 07:19.522
that we can't talk about
'cause I'm doing it, too,

07:19.605 --> 07:21.065
and it's so much fun!

07:21.149 --> 07:22.817
If I knew what
you were talking about

07:22.900 --> 07:24.402
I would tell you
that what you do and what I do

07:24.485 --> 07:26.112
- are two very different things.
- Right.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.363
- And were not...
-Gonna talk about it.

07:29.198 --> 07:31.200
- You seem very put together.
- Do I?

07:31.284 --> 07:33.202
- Yeah, the bangs are a ten.
- Do you love them?

07:33.286 --> 07:34.871
- I do. How's the man?
- He's great.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.539
Marco's wonderful.
How about your man,

07:36.622 --> 07:37.999
even though I'm convinced
he's imaginary

07:38.082 --> 07:39.542
'cause you refuse
to introduce me.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.169
I think I told you
that his name is--

07:41.252 --> 07:42.461
Justin.
- And I think I told you

07:42.545 --> 07:43.880
- he's a--
- Ginger!

07:43.963 --> 07:45.214
- There you go.
- Love you.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.716
- Dinner? Soon?
- Yes.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.092
- Justin, Marco, bring 'em?
- Yes.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.218
- No.
- Okay, great.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.893
- Hey, Jada.
- Hi, Cassie.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.728
I'm just filling in
for someone on this flight.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.479
So you're--
you're on this flight, too.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.857
It would appear as though
I am on the flight.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.526
Yay.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.653
- I'm Seattle-based now.
- Mm.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.905
Taking care of
some family things.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.740
- Oh.
- Look,

08:10.823 --> 08:12.825
I'm the lead on this flight.
I'm not Megan.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.285
I know you know that, but,

08:14.368 --> 08:15.870
let's agree
to no shenanigans.

08:15.953 --> 08:17.580
Listen, Jada,

08:17.663 --> 08:20.208
I quit drinking,
so there'll be no problem.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.793
In fact, I'm striving
to be infraction-less.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.338
Good for you, Cassie.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.423
We'll be good as gold, then.

08:32.386 --> 08:34.680
- Hey, it's Cassie, right?
- Hey, yeah.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.933
That seemed weirdly intense
with Jada. Is everything okay?

08:37.016 --> 08:39.268
Oh. Yeah.
Thanks.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.854
I'm doing this whole "trying
to be a good person" thing.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.481
- It's hard.
- Wow.

08:43.564 --> 08:45.274
Good for you.
Yeah, good luck with that.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.276
I'm Grace,
I'm not a good person,

08:47.360 --> 08:48.945
but I really respect
your journey.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.113
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Actually,

08:51.197 --> 08:52.573
I'm doing a bar night in Berlin.
You should definitely come.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.242
Um, thank you for the invite,

08:54.325 --> 08:55.952
but I actually have to work
when I get there.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.662
Cool. Wait, you have work
in Germany?

08:57.745 --> 09:00.122
Uh, yeah. It's like, uh,
this computer thing.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.124
A little side gig, you know.
Every penny counts.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.834
- Yeah.

10:03.519 --> 10:06.022
- Hey, did you guys land?
- Yeah, uh, we're here.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.024
LAX is
a fucking disaster area.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.859
Yeah, it's been under
construction for years.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.360
No one can understand it.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.987
All right, well, whatever.
I told Max

10:13.070 --> 10:14.864
if we get buried
under debris for forever,

10:14.947 --> 10:16.115
then he gets out of
introducing me to his parents

10:16.198 --> 10:17.950
which he's stoked about,

10:18.034 --> 10:19.952
because he's terrified
and wishes that we didn't come.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.787
And Cassie, Annie's nervous
about her job interview

10:21.871 --> 10:23.205
- and won't admit it.
- Uh, that's not true.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.041
We're headed to your place.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.459
Are you ready to pitch me
on California?

10:26.542 --> 10:28.252
Because I am very on the fence

10:28.336 --> 10:30.212
- and already super jittery.
- All right, come on.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.839
You're gonna crush your
interview. It's gonna be fine.

10:31.922 --> 10:33.507
It's just, you know,
Max thinks

10:33.591 --> 10:35.217
that a year of suspension
from, you know,

10:35.301 --> 10:37.136
actually practicing law
has made me rusty.

10:37.219 --> 10:39.180
- Max does not think that.
- Okay, listen, honey,

10:39.263 --> 10:41.098
if I can pull my multi-car
pileup of a life back together

10:41.182 --> 10:43.100
then getting yours
back on track is gonna be cake.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.977
All right, fine.
That's a fair point.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.896
All right, listen, there's
a key above the doorframe.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.647
Just grab it, go inside.
I'll see you when I get home.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.691
Cassie, you have to stop
with the key thing.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.443
I know, shut up, blech.
I gotta go. Bye.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.742
Oh! Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry!

10:59.825 --> 11:01.452
It was my fault.
I'm not paying attention.

11:01.535 --> 11:03.204
- No, no, no. Wait.
- I need to get over--

11:03.287 --> 11:04.997
You were on the flight.
Imperial Atlantic.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.123
- Leave her alone. She's obv--
- Yes, thank you.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.833
Yes, yes, yes.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.710
But you were on our flight
from Los Angeles earlier.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.462
Listen, we just want to
tell you thank you.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.089
People don't say "thank you"
enough. Thank you

11:13.172 --> 11:14.840
- for a great flight.
- You're welcome.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.425
I'm Gabrielle.
This is my husband Esteban.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.094
Oh, my God,
your hair is perfect.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.012
- Is this a honey blonde?
-Um...

11:20.096 --> 11:21.722
Because I'm thinking
about going blonde,

11:21.806 --> 11:23.265
but I just--
it's a big commitment.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.475
Thank you.
I really have to go.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.102
It was nice to meet you

11:26.185 --> 11:27.186
and thank you for flying
Imperial Atlantic!

11:27.269 --> 11:28.229
Thank you!

11:44.370 --> 11:47.998
Uh, can I have a soda water
with lime, please? Thanks.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.794
Going with
an unleaded drink today?

11:51.877 --> 11:53.587
Uh, yeah,
I don't drink anymore.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.047
- So...
- Me neither.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.967
- Oh.
- Yeah, this is a Coke.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.510
- It's healthier for me.
- Oh.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.180
So you're
a "friend of Bill's"?

12:04.473 --> 12:05.975
Yes.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.893
Yes, it's almost been,
um, a year, actually.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.979
Hmm. Six years for me.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.899
I don't know why I do this.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.735
Sit in bars
after I gave up drinking.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.904
It's--it's a little
masochistic.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.991
Yeah, I'm definitely breaking
rules right now.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.909
Or--actually I'm breaking
a lot of rules,

12:23.993 --> 12:25.578
to be honest, but,

12:25.661 --> 12:27.788
I don't know, for me, I--

12:27.872 --> 12:29.665
I'm Ali.

12:30.666 --> 12:33.669
Um, I don't know, I guess
I just don't want to...

12:33.752 --> 12:35.254
miss out on any excitement.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.591
Yeah.

12:38.674 --> 12:40.843
I'm Will.
Nice to meet you, Ali.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.804
So, what do you think
we're missing out on?

12:43.888 --> 12:45.681
Oh, man, I don't know.

12:45.764 --> 12:48.684
The feeling of not knowing
what's gonna happen, you know?

12:48.767 --> 12:49.977
That--that thrill.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.854
Yeah, I can't even tell you.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.981
I was such a mess.

12:54.064 --> 12:56.108
More spills than thrills.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.610
Not great
for the work life.

12:57.693 --> 13:00.029
What, uh--what do you do?

13:00.112 --> 13:02.323
I'm actually a courier.

13:02.406 --> 13:04.617
It's a...glorified
messenger, really.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.620
Don't always love it,

13:07.703 --> 13:09.788
but drinking used to
help me with that.

13:12.416 --> 13:15.294
Well, I used to be the life
of every party.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.671
You know,
I guess eventually you gotta

13:17.755 --> 13:20.841
just, like, grow up
and be an adult, right?

13:20.925 --> 13:22.384
You think?

13:25.179 --> 13:26.680
Okay, I should go,

13:26.764 --> 13:29.225
squeeze in some sights
before my meeting.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.601
Oh, okay.

13:31.727 --> 13:33.896
Uh, thanks for the chat.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.482
Enjoy Berlin.

14:31.787 --> 14:34.039
Uh, da, taxi? Da.
Schnell, schnell.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.983
Guten Tag.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.609
Willkommen.
Wie kann ich helfen?

17:07.693 --> 17:09.028
- Englisch?
- Yes, of course, ma'am.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.237
- How can I help?
- Danke.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.406
Um, I'm Alessandra Ricci.

17:12.489 --> 17:13.532
I just met a lovely man
in the bar.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.117
His name is Will.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.119
He asked me up to his room
to get together

17:17.202 --> 17:18.454
but I...I don't know,
I got nervous

17:18.537 --> 17:20.080
and I turned him down.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.791
But, um...
I changed my mind.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.627
I actually saw he was--
he was checking in with you.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.546
Um, he told me
his room number.

17:27.629 --> 17:29.965
It was--it was three-something,
but I can't remember.

17:30.048 --> 17:31.633
I feel so stupid.
Do you think you could,

17:31.717 --> 17:34.261
like, help me out?
I just, blah.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.181
The gentleman has a type.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.726
317.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.583
Hello, I'm in 301.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.502
Could I check out a room
in one of the corners?

18:06.585 --> 18:08.086
Um, I don't know
if I want to move,

18:08.170 --> 18:09.838
but I'd love to just,
like, make sure.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.089
Thanks.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.422
The gentleman has a type.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.518
Um...

19:43.015 --> 19:44.474
God.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.797
Who are you?

20:38.153 --> 20:39.821
God. Fuck.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.823
What are you doing?
What is going on?

20:41.907 --> 20:43.450
Okay, fine, fine.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.182
- Hello?
- Cassie.

21:07.265 --> 21:09.518
Megan? Uh, hi.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.269
Listen, I can't really have
one of our weird,

21:11.353 --> 21:13.313
off-the-record chats,
if you don't mind,

21:13.397 --> 21:15.148
so just tell me you're good,
okay? 'Cause I really gotta go.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.692
No, listen, did you get
a key in the mail?

21:16.775 --> 21:17.859
- Megan? Are you there?

22:25.302 --> 22:27.554
First off,
the plane is on fire,

22:27.637 --> 22:29.347
and it was going down
right above our house,

22:29.431 --> 22:31.767
so I ran after it.
I went through the forest,

22:31.850 --> 22:34.394
and--and it saw it land
right in front of us.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.063
And--and--shh.

22:37.981 --> 22:39.232
She's here.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.525
She's here right now.

24:42.647 --> 24:44.524
Ah...heh.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.902
God. Oh, my God.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.695
Okay.

24:50.488 --> 24:52.490
- No, no, no.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.203
No, no, no, no.

24:57.245 --> 25:00.415
No, no.

25:02.626 --> 25:05.795
Oh, Entschuldigung, hi.
This my room.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.756
The key doesn't work.
I'm gonna--

25:07.839 --> 25:09.382
I'm gonna get another one,
but could you please open it?

25:09.466 --> 25:10.592
Please? I'm so tired.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.385
Please.

25:13.470 --> 25:15.388
Thank you.

25:53.718 --> 25:56.846
Wow. That explosion
really rattled you.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.807
Really blew some stuff apart.

26:00.642 --> 26:02.852
What the fuck? What--

26:03.895 --> 26:04.938
What is this?

26:05.021 --> 26:07.315
Oh, I think you know.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.318
No. No, no, no, no.
I'm not doing this again.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.779
Um, are you--are you me?
Oh, God.

26:12.862 --> 26:14.990
Don't answer that. Fuck!
What the fuck--

26:15.073 --> 26:16.491
What, did you think you were
gonna find

26:16.574 --> 26:18.201
some hot dead guy
in here again?

26:18.285 --> 26:19.828
I am not "in here" again

26:19.911 --> 26:21.579
and that was a very fucked-up
thing to say.

26:21.663 --> 26:23.415
Okay, you know,
you keep telling everyone

26:23.498 --> 26:24.958
you don't want to be me anymore,

26:25.041 --> 26:26.501
that you're making
better choices,

26:26.584 --> 26:27.961
that life is just so great.

26:28.044 --> 26:29.629
I'm just not buying it.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.589
Well, I don't give a shit
if you buy it or not.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.675
I am making better choices,
okay?

26:33.758 --> 26:35.343
My life is really good.
I'm making--

26:35.427 --> 26:37.053
I'm making strides
and doing really well

26:37.137 --> 26:38.972
and I do--I do not
need this shit right now.

26:40.265 --> 26:41.766
Then why follow
that guy from the bar?

26:41.850 --> 26:43.018
Wha--

26:43.101 --> 26:46.104
I mean, he's dead,
so, aah!

26:46.187 --> 26:49.065
And you almost got
yourself killed here in Berlin.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.525
I mean, if you're still making

26:50.608 --> 26:52.319
so many
self-destructive choices,

26:52.402 --> 26:54.404
why don't you just have
a fucking cocktail?

26:54.487 --> 26:57.032
Uh, my boss calling me
from the CIA

26:57.115 --> 26:58.700
is probably not the best timing,
so I'm just gonna--

26:58.783 --> 27:00.452
I'm not gonna answer it.
That's my plan.

27:00.535 --> 27:01.619
That's the plan right now.

27:01.703 --> 27:03.121
Good plan.

27:03.204 --> 27:04.789
He'll probably think
you're dead anyway

27:04.873 --> 27:06.833
or you know,
got "over-involved" again,

27:06.916 --> 27:08.626
or thinks "Did you really see
what you think that you saw?"

27:08.710 --> 27:10.337
Well, I don't--I don't know
what I saw.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.588
Doesn't mean you won't
get blamed for it.

27:11.671 --> 27:13.173
Hey, you know what?

27:13.256 --> 27:15.216
Cheers to making
better choices, baby! Whoo!

27:20.722 --> 27:22.807
Benjamin, hi.
Hi. Hi, how are you?

27:22.891 --> 27:24.726
Bowden, are you okay?
We got intelligence

27:24.809 --> 27:25.935
about an explosion.

27:27.270 --> 27:29.856
Uh, a what?
An explosion? Oh.

27:29.939 --> 27:32.692
No, when my mark left earlier,
I just came up to the room

27:32.776 --> 27:34.611
and went to sleep, so.

27:34.694 --> 27:36.279
Well, we still have intel
coming in,

27:36.363 --> 27:38.073
- but did you see anything?
- No.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.158
No, like I said, you know,
I was in my hotel.

27:40.241 --> 27:42.535
"Emphasis on the civilian,"
that's what you told me, so...

27:42.619 --> 27:44.412
that's--that's what I did.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.915
Well, the CCTV footage
should have more information.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.750
I'm just glad you're okay.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.711
Uh, yeah. Yeah, thank you.
Uh, it's--it's late.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.171
I actually gotta get
to the airport.

27:53.254 --> 27:54.297
I--I gotta go. Okay.
Sorry.

28:28.665 --> 28:30.291
Rezeption.
Wie kann ich helfen?

28:30.375 --> 28:32.210
Hi. Hi, this is
Cassandra Bowden.

28:32.293 --> 28:34.462
I'm in room 301.
Um, how can I tell

28:34.546 --> 28:36.548
if someone else has possibly
been in my room

28:36.631 --> 28:39.592
when I wasn't here? Because I
seem to be missing some stuff.

28:39.676 --> 28:41.177
Can you help me
with that, please?

28:41.261 --> 28:44.180
It says Cassandra Bowden
checked out.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.058
Thank you.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.021
What the fuck?!

28:57.402 --> 28:59.112
Ah, Ms. Bowden.
Back again?

28:59.195 --> 29:01.656
I'm sorry?
We haven't met.

29:01.739 --> 29:03.908
No, we spoke
when you checked out.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.327
In the confusion,
after the explosion.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.997
Your sunglasses were
very chic at night.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.666
You asked before. They are
saying it was a gas line.

29:11.749 --> 29:14.252
Uh...oh. A gas line. Wow.

29:14.335 --> 29:16.254
Okay, great, but I didn't--
I didn't check out.

29:16.337 --> 29:18.339
But funny enough,
my key stopped working.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.509
Here you go. And, uh,
my bag was not in my room.

29:21.593 --> 29:24.429
But didn't check out. Nope.
Here I am.

29:24.512 --> 29:27.015
But you were here
in this uniform earlier.

29:27.098 --> 29:30.477
Okay, so, um, wasn't me.
I did not check out

29:30.560 --> 29:32.937
because I am me,
and I am standing here

29:33.021 --> 29:36.024
in front of you, so that I know
I did not check out.

29:36.107 --> 29:38.026
I am here. Right here.
Your mistake.

29:38.109 --> 29:39.736
That was not me.

29:41.529 --> 29:42.989
Wasn't me.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.669
Snap out of it.
You okay?

29:56.753 --> 29:58.880
Yeah, sorry. I'm just,
um, still thrown

29:58.963 --> 30:00.465
- from that explosion.
- Mm-hmm.

30:00.548 --> 30:02.717
God, my ears are still,
like, ringing.

30:03.593 --> 30:06.221
So, listen, I saw you
last night at the bar.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.014
Thank you. This way.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.891
Having a great time
with that guy, so I don't think

30:09.974 --> 30:11.434
you're hungover from
the whole explosion thing.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.269
It was a lime and soda,
trust me.

30:13.353 --> 30:15.146
Oh, I remember the speech
you gave yesterday about change.

30:15.230 --> 30:17.732
- Yeah.
- So fun.

30:17.815 --> 30:20.235
If you don't want to greet,
go seat first class.

30:20.318 --> 30:23.029
- Fine.
- Bye. Oh, thank you.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.909
I mean, I was in my hotel room
when it happened, but,

30:27.992 --> 30:29.410
I heard it was a gas main.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.246
But, I know I'm gonna
sound crazy, but,

30:31.329 --> 30:33.748
I'm starting to think maybe
it was like a--hey.

30:36.084 --> 30:38.253
I don't know, like,
in a briefcase or something?

30:38.336 --> 30:40.255
"In a briefcase"?
That's so specific.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.423
I know, well,
I watch a lot of Dateline.

30:42.507 --> 30:45.051
Okay, so, I used to date
this couple--

30:45.134 --> 30:46.928
Well, I used to fuck
this couple,

30:47.011 --> 30:49.389
and they were really into
those true crime docuseries,

30:49.472 --> 30:51.099
and we watched one
that was about bombs,

30:51.182 --> 30:53.434
and the media attention
that they get.

30:53.518 --> 30:56.062
And I'm seriously not
an expert, but,

30:56.145 --> 30:57.272
I think if it was that,

30:58.565 --> 31:00.316
then we would've heard
about it already, right?

31:00.400 --> 31:01.818
We didn't go
to any biergartens.

31:01.901 --> 31:03.570
How fun are biergartens?

31:03.653 --> 31:05.780
What would happen if, like,
I didn't engage with you?

31:05.863 --> 31:07.240
Uh, you'd keep staring holes

31:07.323 --> 31:09.158
into the cocktails
Grace is making?

31:09.242 --> 31:10.952
- I wasn't doing that.
- Well, your nerves are frayed,

31:11.035 --> 31:12.620
and you're having bouts
of tinnitus.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.372
- Bouts of what?
- That ringing in your ears?

31:14.455 --> 31:15.957
Tinnitus.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.292
Also this drink will
really take the edge off.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.627
Okay, well,
I can't have a drink,

31:19.711 --> 31:21.421
'cause if I have one drink
then I just want

31:21.504 --> 31:22.839
all the fucking drinks.
You should know that.

31:22.922 --> 31:24.507
Oh, I think we both know that.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.134
By the way, your new friend
Grace seems cool.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.844
Kinda like how you used
to be cool?

31:27.927 --> 31:29.429
And that little, like,
scarf on her neck.

31:29.512 --> 31:30.722
Like, "Who am I?
I'm so effortless."

31:30.805 --> 31:32.473
Fun new party friend.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.559
Yeah, well, I'm more the
designated driver these days.

31:34.642 --> 31:36.477
Yeah, well, no one wants to hang
out with the designated driver.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.146
You wanna know why?
'Cause it's boring.

31:38.229 --> 31:39.689
By the way,
your hands are shaking.

31:47.447 --> 31:50.491
Um, hey, your scarf is, like,
from two years ago.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.493
- It looks really cute on you.
- Yeah.

31:52.577 --> 31:55.330
I know it's kitsch, but I feel
like it keeps people guessing.

31:55.413 --> 31:56.831
Um, give me your phone.

31:56.914 --> 31:58.791
- I want to text myself.
- Oh, yeah.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.501
And then I'll send you
my details,

32:00.585 --> 32:02.337
and then
we can hang out in LA.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.172
- Yeah.
- Uh, excuse me?

32:04.255 --> 32:05.715
Is there another lavatory?

32:05.798 --> 32:06.841
- It's right over there.
- It's over there.

32:08.718 --> 32:11.012
Jinx. You owe me a drink.

32:11.095 --> 32:13.181
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. And speaking of drinks,

32:13.264 --> 32:15.892
- can you take that to 4A?
- Yeah.

32:24.025 --> 32:26.027
Here you go, sir.
Can I get you anything else?

32:26.110 --> 32:28.404
- Thanks a lot, I'm okay.
- Okay.

32:30.448 --> 32:32.116
Is there something else?

32:34.369 --> 32:37.038
No. Uh, just let us know
if you need something.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.047
Jim Jones.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.549
Oh, my God.
Hide the Kool-Aid.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.468
- Okay, can I confess something?
- Yeah.

32:50.551 --> 32:52.220
That guy's milky eye is really
creeping me out.

32:52.303 --> 32:53.554
- I know.
- But I'm gonna own it.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.056
- I'm owning it.
- Uh-huh.

32:55.139 --> 32:56.224
Do you think
it affects his vision?

33:20.581 --> 33:21.958
- Excuse me.
- Hmm?

33:22.041 --> 33:23.584
Oh, I didn't mean
to startle you.

33:23.668 --> 33:25.253
You just look,
uh, have we met before?

33:25.336 --> 33:27.213
No, I'm sorry.
I'm in a rush. Sorry.

33:29.006 --> 33:30.591
Don't follow me.
Don't follow me.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.093
Don't follow me.

34:03.082 --> 34:05.793
- You okay?
- Aah! Oh.

34:05.877 --> 34:09.047
Sorry.
I didn't mean to scream.

34:09.130 --> 34:12.467
Just gonna...I'm just gonna
stand right here, so...

34:12.550 --> 34:14.552
Okay.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.643
- Oh, hi!
- Hey!

34:22.727 --> 34:25.146
Oh, my goodness,
you're in my house!

34:26.898 --> 34:29.567
I want to know who waters
all of these plants

34:29.650 --> 34:31.360
- that are alive.
- Shut up.

34:31.444 --> 34:35.239
Because it's not you.
And you have throw pillows?

34:35.323 --> 34:37.492
There are so many,
it's like someone lives here.

34:37.575 --> 34:39.660
It's lovely. Hey, Cass,
how was the trip?

34:39.744 --> 34:41.496
My trip was horrible.

34:41.579 --> 34:43.164
I'm so glad you guys
are here.

34:43.247 --> 34:44.832
We are too. Thank you so much
for having us.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.667
- What?
- We could've stayed in a hotel.

34:46.751 --> 34:49.003
- Or at my folks' place.
- Definitely not with his folks.

34:49.086 --> 34:50.797
- That was not an option.
- Come here.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.507
- I missed having you--
- Give me a big hug,

34:52.590 --> 34:54.634
the hugs that you love
so much.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.636
Oh, my God. You know,
it doesn't--it really--

34:56.719 --> 34:59.180
I did miss you, though.
I miss your pretty blonde hair.

34:59.263 --> 35:02.099
Get out of my house,
or tell me what is on your hand.

35:02.183 --> 35:03.684
What is on your hand?!
Oh, my God!

35:03.768 --> 35:05.603
Oh, my God, stop.
Okay, if you stop--

35:05.686 --> 35:09.023
Stop screaming.
It is a ring that Max gave to me

35:09.106 --> 35:11.776
that I wear because
it is beautiful and that is it.

35:11.859 --> 35:13.861
- Fuck off, you're engaged!
- I am not!

35:13.945 --> 35:15.530
You're engaged!
You're engaged!

35:15.613 --> 35:17.448
- I'm gonna leave.
- No, no, no, no, no.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.158
- Tell me more. Tell me more.
- Okay. Okay. Okay, look.

35:19.242 --> 35:21.035
- Look, I wear it on this finger
- Okay.

35:21.118 --> 35:22.995
...because it only fits
on that finger,

35:23.079 --> 35:26.040
and Max and I are
in continuous discussions

35:26.123 --> 35:29.001
about the future and what this
ring means in technical terms.

35:29.085 --> 35:30.378
Yeah, see,
she gets into lawyer mode

35:30.461 --> 35:31.963
and I immediately surrender.

35:32.046 --> 35:33.965
You are such a lucky man.
Will you unzip me?

35:34.048 --> 35:35.800
I gotta get out of this thing.
Max, you promised to call me

35:35.883 --> 35:37.510
- when she said yes.
- She didn't say yes yet.

35:37.593 --> 35:39.470
Go fuck yourself.
You knew about this?

35:39.554 --> 35:41.889
Oh, my God, are you insane?
Of course I knew about this.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.391
He called me
and we went over

35:43.474 --> 35:45.059
the pros and cons
of marrying you

35:45.143 --> 35:46.727
which, by the way,
there are a lot of cons.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.646
He didn't even let me
see the ring.

35:48.729 --> 35:51.023
Well, look, there is a ring.
She's actually wearing it.

35:51.107 --> 35:52.525
Baby steps. Baby steps.

35:52.608 --> 35:54.485
Just, enough with the ring,
okay?

35:54.569 --> 35:56.487
I want to talk about
Yamashiro.

35:56.571 --> 35:59.240
I want to talk about
Santa Monica Pier and Malibu

35:59.323 --> 36:01.242
but only to go to that
really chic Fred Segal place.

36:01.325 --> 36:02.410
- Tourist.
- Where else should we go?

36:02.493 --> 36:03.411
History of tacos--

36:03.494 --> 36:04.912
Whoa, really?

36:04.996 --> 36:06.455
Okay, keep going.
Where do you want to go?

36:06.539 --> 36:08.249
Also, when do we get
to meet the

36:08.332 --> 36:11.252
"very grounded and handsome"
photographer Marco?

36:11.335 --> 36:12.837
Is that how I described him
to you?

36:12.920 --> 36:14.630
- Yes.
- I don't recall that, but

36:14.714 --> 36:16.507
you are gonna meet him.
We're gonna have dinner

36:16.591 --> 36:18.092
tomorrow night, and please
don't scare him away.

36:18.175 --> 36:19.760
Okay?
'Cause I really like him.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.762
- I make no promises.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.598
Okay, whoever that is, they
cannot have the guest room,

36:23.681 --> 36:25.433
because I claim squatter's
rights and I've been

36:25.516 --> 36:27.393
volunteering at the
Brooklyn Legal Aid Society

36:27.476 --> 36:29.103
for the past year, so
I'm well-versed in this shit.

36:32.773 --> 36:34.775
- Cassie Bowden?
- Mm-hmm?

36:34.859 --> 36:36.527
We need you to come down
to the field office with us.

36:36.611 --> 36:39.071
Oh, sorry, right now?
My friends are here.

36:39.155 --> 36:40.948
We were gonna go eat,
and this--right now?

36:41.032 --> 36:43.201
This is not an optional
invitation.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.120
Okay.

36:46.203 --> 36:47.413
We're gonna get taco stand?

36:47.496 --> 36:49.248
I'm--I'm not trying a taco--

36:49.332 --> 36:51.250
You think I'm gonna eat
street food?

36:51.334 --> 36:53.377
- You're gonna like a taco.
- I'm not eating street food.

37:02.845 --> 37:05.097
Wow. Hi. Um,

37:05.181 --> 37:07.183
I don't know what face
you're attempting to make,

37:07.266 --> 37:09.310
but if it's a happy one,
you are not succeeding.

37:09.393 --> 37:10.853
No, it is.
No, I'm so happy.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.688
I'm so happy.
I'm also sad, though,

37:12.772 --> 37:14.482
'cause I have to leave you
for just a hot second,

37:14.565 --> 37:16.484
but it's, um, not a big deal.
I'm so sorry.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.152
I have to help out a friend.
It's actually an AA thing,

37:18.235 --> 37:19.820
so I can't--
I can't talk about it.

37:19.904 --> 37:22.156
So listen,
you guys just chill,

37:22.239 --> 37:24.325
and I will be back.
We'll have dinner.

37:24.408 --> 37:26.661
It's gonna be great.
I'm so happy you're...

37:26.744 --> 37:29.664
Just--I'm just so happy.
I'll be back, though, okay?

37:33.250 --> 37:35.419
I'm gonna just--I'm gonna
let that one go.

37:38.589 --> 37:40.883
So it much be pretty important
for Benjamin to send you guys

37:40.967 --> 37:42.843
to pick me up, huh?

37:42.927 --> 37:44.136
Mr. Berry didn't send us.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.263
Oh.

37:46.347 --> 37:47.473
That makes me
even more nervous.

37:47.556 --> 37:49.809
So who did send you?

37:49.892 --> 37:51.352
Oh. Okay.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.187
I still need to write up
my notes from Berlin.

37:53.270 --> 37:55.856
- I'll get 'em to you soon.
- Great.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.483
I was gonna do it
on the plane,

37:57.566 --> 37:59.110
but it turns out
this kind of friend of mine

37:59.193 --> 38:00.987
from New York
was our team leader

38:01.070 --> 38:02.571
and she was watching me
like a hawk. It was so annoying.

38:02.655 --> 38:03.864
You didn't tell me
you were on site

38:03.948 --> 38:05.199
when the guy got blown up.

38:05.282 --> 38:07.535
'Cause we know you were there.

38:07.618 --> 38:09.286
You lied.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.831
Cassie, you could've died.
Do you understand that?

38:13.499 --> 38:15.876
I'm about to have
to explain you to my boss,

38:15.960 --> 38:18.170
and Dot Karlson is someone
I try to

38:18.254 --> 38:20.297
not have to explain things
to ever.

38:20.381 --> 38:22.550
How scary can a woman be
named Dot?

38:22.633 --> 38:24.885
This is probably gonna be
your last day as an asset.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.721
What? Why?

38:26.804 --> 38:29.390
Look, I know I messed up
a little bit.

38:29.473 --> 38:31.142
Please, don't do--

38:31.225 --> 38:34.311
Acts of service are a really
big deal in AA, okay?

38:34.395 --> 38:37.189
Alcoholics Anonymous
is anonymous.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.899
So stop talking about it.

38:38.983 --> 38:41.485
Sorry, I just--listen,
this is my act of service,

38:41.569 --> 38:43.362
helping the CIA.

38:43.446 --> 38:45.906
It's the only exciting thing
I have in my life right now,

38:45.990 --> 38:47.575
and I don't know why
I just said that to you.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.118
I don't either.

38:49.201 --> 38:50.995
Because it's not exciting
if you're dead.

38:51.078 --> 38:53.205
-Yes?

38:53.289 --> 38:56.542
Yes, they're here.
Yes, he is.

38:58.210 --> 38:59.837
Ms. Karlson will see you now,
Mr. Berry.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.505
Ms. Bowden, would you please
wait here?

39:13.309 --> 39:15.936
Hi. Benjamin's kinda sexy,
huh?

39:16.020 --> 39:17.271
Holy fuck.

39:19.940 --> 39:21.609
You should eavesdrop.
100%.

39:21.692 --> 39:23.110
Scoot over.
See if you can hear them.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.071
He's hot,
but he might be in there

39:25.154 --> 39:27.198
trying to steal the one
thrilling thing you have going.

39:30.534 --> 39:31.827
Perfect. Super subtle.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.580
She's a liability.

39:34.663 --> 39:36.123
- What kind of person would--
-The kind of person

39:36.207 --> 39:37.792
that wants to do this work.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.627
How many people do you know
who could wake up

39:39.710 --> 39:41.629
next to a dead body
in a foreign country

39:41.712 --> 39:43.798
and get back to the US
without incident?

39:43.881 --> 39:45.466
How many people do I know

39:45.549 --> 39:47.760
that would even end up
in that situation at all?

39:54.141 --> 39:55.893
First off, don't be nervous.

39:55.976 --> 39:58.270
Very technically, you haven't
done anything wrong here.

39:58.354 --> 40:00.648
Right, Mr. Berry?

40:00.731 --> 40:01.982
Very technically.

40:02.733 --> 40:05.194
Look, I have work I need
to get back to. Excuse me.

40:08.656 --> 40:10.658
What passes for boldness
in men here

40:10.741 --> 40:13.202
is often seen as reckless
in women.

40:13.285 --> 40:16.497
It's happened to me more times
than I can count, Cassie.

40:16.580 --> 40:17.540
Trust me.

40:22.169 --> 40:24.213
Cassie, you probably
don't know this, but

40:24.296 --> 40:26.090
Mr. Berry fought
to be your handler.

40:26.173 --> 40:28.175
So we're just gonna give him
some time to cool off.

40:28.259 --> 40:31.011
I definitely did not know
he fought to be my handler.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.930
I didn't even think
he liked me.

40:33.013 --> 40:34.682
Cassie,
how are you holding up?

40:34.765 --> 40:36.934
After your assignment
in Germany, I mean.

40:37.017 --> 40:40.354
Oh, I'm fi--actually, I--
I do want to show you something.

40:40.437 --> 40:42.940
- Okay.
- Um, so,

40:43.023 --> 40:44.525
there was this woman
in Berlin--

40:44.608 --> 40:46.068
Wait, um, how do you have
your phone?

40:46.152 --> 40:47.945
They're supposed to take
visitors' phones

40:48.028 --> 40:50.156
- when they enter the office.
- I don't know. Sorry.

40:50.239 --> 40:52.199
Anyway, there was a woman

40:52.283 --> 40:54.702
that looked exactly like me
in Berlin, and um--

40:54.785 --> 40:58.539
So she gave the mark--Will,
the guy that died--a briefcase,

40:58.622 --> 40:59.999
and I just didn't
want you to think

41:00.082 --> 41:01.584
I wasn't, like,
on top of it.

41:01.667 --> 41:03.377
What exactly
am I looking at here?

41:03.460 --> 41:05.045
So, I took pictures from
the hotel across the street,

41:05.129 --> 41:06.380
but there was
also a group of men

41:06.463 --> 41:07.673
that was in the room above them,

41:07.756 --> 41:09.216
and I swear they were listening.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.302
All right.
The man you were observing

41:11.385 --> 41:13.554
was an informant
for the CIA.

41:13.637 --> 41:15.347
But a faulty gas main

41:15.431 --> 41:18.184
is responsible
for the explosion, so,

41:18.267 --> 41:20.186
bad luck for him.

41:20.269 --> 41:22.104
Next time, please surrender
your phone when you come in.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.690
Sorry, uh, but, um...
what about the woman?

41:24.773 --> 41:26.984
I mean, she literally looked
exactly like me.

41:27.067 --> 41:29.069
She had the same tattoo on her
back that I have.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.155
We can refer you
to a trauma specialist

41:31.238 --> 41:33.866
if you're feeling in any way
overwhelmed.

41:33.949 --> 41:36.035
- No, I'm--
- Because, between us,

41:36.118 --> 41:38.537
I really couldn't
make out much there.

41:38.621 --> 41:40.915
Your adrenaline was really going
and that can affect

41:40.998 --> 41:42.917
the way you see things

41:43.000 --> 41:44.501
or remember things.

41:44.585 --> 41:47.004
And while I'm sure
your tattoo is lovely,

41:47.087 --> 41:48.631
a lot of other women made

41:48.714 --> 41:51.175
similar interesting choices
in their 20s.

41:52.218 --> 41:54.011
Uh, thank you, but I'm--

41:54.094 --> 41:58.057
I really feel fine and
I know exactly what I saw.

41:58.140 --> 42:00.434
Cassie,
I need you to be thoughtful

42:00.518 --> 42:02.269
about how you talk about this,

42:02.353 --> 42:05.189
because if people think
you're involved in any way,

42:05.272 --> 42:07.107
it would be bad.

42:09.443 --> 42:11.528
So why don't you send me
the photos of what you saw,

42:11.612 --> 42:14.740
and if I see anything
actionable, I'll look into it.

42:15.783 --> 42:17.243
Okay?

42:17.326 --> 42:19.411
Uh, um...all right.

42:21.455 --> 42:23.123
Oh, and do me a favor.

42:23.207 --> 42:25.960
We're gonna have Imperial
Atlantic temporarily ground you.

42:26.043 --> 42:27.461
Take a few days and rest up.

42:27.544 --> 42:28.921
Wait, wait,
I'm not gonna be flying?

42:29.004 --> 42:31.090
Don't think of it like that.

42:31.173 --> 42:32.549
We'll be in touch soon.

42:32.633 --> 42:34.510
- Uh, thanks so much.
- Okay.

42:39.348 --> 42:40.808
Wow, no more flights
for you, huh?

42:40.891 --> 42:42.309
Fuck off.

42:42.393 --> 42:43.686
Not you. You seem great.

43:03.247 --> 43:05.165
You only have to
push it once.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.334
- Oh, is that how it works?

43:13.841 --> 43:16.093
- Hi. Guys, sorry.
- Hi.

43:16.176 --> 43:17.469
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:17.553 --> 43:19.221
How's everything
with your friend?

43:19.305 --> 43:21.682
Oh, it was fine. Just had to
help her move something.

43:21.765 --> 43:23.976
Cool.
In, uh, leopard-print boots?

43:24.059 --> 43:26.645
Uh, I'm sorry. I didn't know
there was official footwear

43:26.729 --> 43:29.023
for helping someone move
a ginormous lamp.

43:29.106 --> 43:30.607
Hey, what's with
this weird letter?

43:30.691 --> 43:32.192
It's plastered
in European postage,

43:32.276 --> 43:33.902
but it's addressed to you
and from you.

43:33.986 --> 43:36.530
Uh, I was testing out
the postal system.

43:36.614 --> 43:39.116
Yeah, I saw this crazy special
on Dateline,

43:39.199 --> 43:41.118
- and I had to try it.
- Cool.

43:41.201 --> 43:42.828
- We're still watching Dateline.
- Oh, yeah.

43:42.911 --> 43:44.163
- Live by it. Every night.
- Great. Cool.

43:45.748 --> 43:47.750
Only been here a couple hours
and already all these mysteries.

43:47.833 --> 43:49.668
Babe, the postal service has
been in slow decline for years.

43:49.752 --> 43:51.211
If people want to test
its efficacy,

43:51.295 --> 43:52.546
- Oh, no.
- then they should test

43:52.629 --> 43:53.881
- its efficacy.
- Nope.

43:53.964 --> 43:55.257
What do you want for dinner?

43:55.341 --> 43:56.800
And don't say
In-N-Out Burger,

43:56.884 --> 43:58.552
but also please say
In-N-Out Burger.

43:58.635 --> 43:59.970
Uh, yes, I gotta go make
a quick call, one second,

44:00.054 --> 44:01.513
but obviously In-N-Out Burger.

44:01.597 --> 44:03.807
Okay, good,
'cause I'm really hungry!

44:09.063 --> 44:10.230
"Oh, hi, Megan.

44:10.314 --> 44:11.774
"So last time you called me

44:11.857 --> 44:13.317
"I was involved
in a huge explosion,

44:13.400 --> 44:14.943
"and I fell over,
can't remember,

44:15.027 --> 44:16.820
"and my ears are, um,
fucking ringing

44:16.904 --> 44:18.113
and it's the biggest fucking
nightmare of my life,"

44:18.197 --> 44:19.823
but no, I'm not gonna...

44:19.907 --> 44:22.409
Not gonna tell you that part,
so...okay.

44:32.753 --> 44:34.922
Megan? Hi.

44:35.005 --> 44:37.841
Hey, it's me.
Um, are you okay?

44:37.925 --> 44:39.885
Seriously, I'm so sorry.
Last time you called

44:39.968 --> 44:41.428
there was a lot
of shit going on.

44:41.512 --> 44:44.098
Um, but I--I--I
got a--the key.

44:44.181 --> 44:46.016
The key. Is there anything
more I should know?

44:46.100 --> 44:47.518
This is very vague
and very creepy,

44:47.601 --> 44:49.269
and I'm very worried
about you.

44:49.353 --> 44:50.854
So please call me.
Call me!

44:50.938 --> 44:52.231
Seriously, call me.
Okay, bye.

44:55.776 --> 44:57.444
- I'm slaying those.
- Okay.

44:57.528 --> 44:58.946
- Crushing it.
- Who's ready for some amazing

44:59.029 --> 45:00.239
drive-thru food,
animal style?

45:00.322 --> 45:01.281
- Hm. Yeah.
- Yeah.

45:02.366 --> 45:03.784
Uh, hold on.

45:03.867 --> 45:05.285
Cassie?

45:05.369 --> 45:07.204
No, food, right now,

45:07.287 --> 45:09.164
or Max loses a limb.
I'm not kidding.

45:09.248 --> 45:11.417
It's nothing. It's just
an automated text from Imperial.

45:11.500 --> 45:14.795
They said they found
my luggage...at LAX.

45:14.878 --> 45:16.755
It'll be delivered here
within an hour.

45:17.881 --> 45:19.425
Wow, that is so weird.

45:19.508 --> 45:21.427
Okay, but that's good news,
right?

45:21.510 --> 45:23.512
- Yeah.
- It's not

45:23.595 --> 45:26.098
registering as good news.
Okay, you--

45:26.181 --> 45:27.891
you've been making excuses
all day and I'm over it.

45:27.975 --> 45:29.476
You need to talk to us.
Max, agree with me.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.145
Fully agree.
What's going on, Cass?

45:31.228 --> 45:33.730
Um...

45:33.814 --> 45:35.566
Okay.

45:35.649 --> 45:37.651
Don't freak out.

45:37.734 --> 45:39.486
There was a huge explosion
in Berlin in the street

45:39.570 --> 45:40.654
and I was, like, right there.

45:40.737 --> 45:42.114
I'm fine. I'm fine.

45:42.197 --> 45:43.949
But it--it shook me up,

45:44.032 --> 45:45.659
and then when I went back
to my room my luggage was gone.

45:45.742 --> 45:47.661
That's fun, and my ears
are ringing,

45:47.744 --> 45:49.621
um, and, uh, yeah.

45:49.705 --> 45:51.832
So it's been crazy and creepy,

45:51.915 --> 45:53.834
and I did not want to start
your trip off on a weird note.

45:53.917 --> 45:55.377
Can we just leave it at that
for now?

45:55.461 --> 45:56.795
I'm--I'm--
I'm taking care of it.

45:56.879 --> 45:58.714
Okay.
I'd be upset, too.

45:58.797 --> 46:00.674
It sounds like a lot.

46:00.757 --> 46:03.135
Yeah, it--
it was not a little, so.

46:04.428 --> 46:06.847
Look, babe, uh, we're just happy
that you're okay

46:06.930 --> 46:08.390
and that you weren't hurt.

46:08.474 --> 46:10.184
- Yes.
- And look, we'll wait with you

46:10.267 --> 46:12.144
- until you get your luggage.
- No, no, no.

46:12.227 --> 46:13.854
- You're starving. No, let's--
- No, look, it's fine.

46:13.937 --> 46:15.481
I'll just eat
one of Max's arms.

46:15.564 --> 46:17.191
He has two!
He has two arms.

46:17.274 --> 46:18.567
- So you can snack, too.
- Yeah.

46:22.154 --> 46:23.822
That's definitely my bag.

46:23.906 --> 46:25.199
Sign here.

46:25.282 --> 46:27.159
Uh, thanks for driving it
out here.

46:27.242 --> 46:29.661
I'm sure traffic was horrible
as usual. Hey, quick question:

46:29.745 --> 46:31.205
Do you know what flight
this came off?

46:31.288 --> 46:33.373
I just deliver the bags.

46:33.457 --> 46:35.542
- I did my part, you know?
- Oh.

46:35.626 --> 46:37.211
You don't know
where your bag was?

46:37.294 --> 46:39.046
No, I do.

46:39.129 --> 46:40.881
No, actually, not--I don't.

46:40.964 --> 46:43.217
I--I did, but
I'm a little not sure.

46:43.300 --> 46:45.010
Yeah, I'mma let you
figure it out.

46:45.093 --> 46:46.512
Have a nice day.

46:51.892 --> 46:53.560
Wow. He was fun.

46:53.644 --> 46:55.479
Who says customer service
is dead, right?

46:55.562 --> 46:57.314
- Yeah, well...

46:57.397 --> 46:58.857
- I'm not a customer.
- Oh, so...

47:01.443 --> 47:02.778
Hey, you okay?

47:02.861 --> 47:06.198
Okay, so, um...

47:06.281 --> 47:08.325
that is my blue ribbon
that I always have

47:08.408 --> 47:11.078
but it's always on
that zipper. So, um...

47:11.161 --> 47:12.663
Okay, you're acting like
a weirdo.

47:12.746 --> 47:14.039
You probably
just fucking moved it.

47:14.122 --> 47:15.499
I didn't move it.

47:15.582 --> 47:17.251
Okay, why don't you just
open it up

47:17.334 --> 47:19.002
and see if everything's inside,

47:19.086 --> 47:20.254
- and we can go get some food.
- Yes, please.

47:24.091 --> 47:25.759
Okay, ew, that's not mine.

47:25.842 --> 47:27.261
What--what do you mean,
that's not yours?

47:27.344 --> 47:28.846
- That's not mine.
- Oh, okay.

47:28.929 --> 47:30.514
Well, it looks like
your uniform.

47:30.597 --> 47:32.224
Trust me, the one I was wearing,
you unzipped it,

47:32.307 --> 47:34.851
and that was--that one is--
that's not mine.

47:34.935 --> 47:38.021
Hey, you got a View-Master.
They're awesome.

47:38.105 --> 47:39.565
I don't know what that is.

47:39.648 --> 47:40.941
That is--
I didn't put that in this--

47:41.024 --> 47:42.776
this is obviously not my--I--

47:42.859 --> 47:45.237
Okay, okay, the View-Master
is not yours. Okay.

47:49.074 --> 47:50.951
Oh, my God, what is that?
Someone tell me what that is.

47:51.034 --> 47:52.911
- What is that?
- That--that--uh, fuck.

47:52.995 --> 47:55.163
That is, uh, I believe
that is a wig with blood on it.

47:55.247 --> 47:56.999
Why is there a wig with blood
on it in your suitcase?

47:57.082 --> 47:59.084
Holy shit, I touched it.
I touched all the things!

47:59.167 --> 48:01.128
- I touched it!
- Uh, yes, you did touch

48:01.211 --> 48:02.963
all the things.

48:03.046 --> 48:05.465
Um, okay, here's the thing--

48:05.549 --> 48:07.801
There are a lot of weird things
going on around me,

48:07.884 --> 48:10.429
more than you know, and, um,
I'm starting to think

48:10.512 --> 48:13.807
that maybe someone
is pretending to be me.

48:18.186 --> 48:19.771
- Hello?!

48:19.855 --> 48:21.857
- No, it's bad. Very bad.
- Shut the fuck up, Max!

48:21.940 --> 48:23.734
- Okay, sorry.
- That is actually very bad

48:23.817 --> 48:25.277
and, uh, kind of terrifying,
but yeah--
