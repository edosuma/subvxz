What kind of reaction?
Are you sick?

14:40.013 --> 14:42.313
I am definitely feeling
very strange right now.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.948
You should go
to the doctor.

14:43.950 --> 14:46.317
Amanda, I am fine.
I'm fine. I just--

14:46.319 --> 14:48.887
I need you to figure out
where this stuff came from.

14:48.889 --> 14:52.056
<i>I'll see what I can do,</i>
<i>but you need to come home</i>
<i>right now. We need to find</i>

14:52.058 --> 14:54.058
A replacement
for mirabella <i>today.</i>

14:54.060 --> 14:56.561
Yeah. I came here
to convince mirabella

14:56.563 --> 14:59.564
That marco is not worth
giving up her career for.

14:59.566 --> 15:03.167
And now I know
how to prove it.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.970
What are you going to do?
<i>I'm going to seduce marco.</i>

15:05.972 --> 15:08.539
<i>You're going to seduce</i>
<i>the playboy prince?</i>

15:08.541 --> 15:12.343
I'm going to show her
that lover boy here
isn't cut out to keep promises.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.912
Just find out what you can
about that tonic

15:13.914 --> 15:15.513
<i>And call me back.</i>

15:41.607 --> 15:43.541
Excuse me, sir.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.344
I'll have you know that
I'm an almost-married woman.

15:46.346 --> 15:50.114
Oh, that's all right,
I'm an almost-married man.

15:50.116 --> 15:54.686
And this is how you choose
to spend your last few
precious hours of freedom?

15:54.688 --> 15:57.355
Hours?
I only need five minutes.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.523
Ew!
( both laughing )

15:58.525 --> 16:01.192
What do we have here?

16:01.194 --> 16:02.961
Put that down!
No, no!

16:02.963 --> 16:04.629
In a marriage
there are no secrets.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.465
We're not married yet!
Not for a couple of days.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.467
So we do have secrets!
You started your novel?

16:09.469 --> 16:11.602
No!
Oh, great!

16:11.604 --> 16:13.705
Like father, like daughter.
No!

16:13.707 --> 16:18.109
He's not a novelist.
He teaches comparative
literature at nyu.

16:18.111 --> 16:22.313
Besides, I'm gonna stay in bed
with you all day
and have six kids. Stop!

16:22.315 --> 16:23.348
They're my vows.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.649
Sorry. Sorry.

16:24.651 --> 16:28.152
Hmm. So...

16:28.154 --> 16:30.388
How are yours coming along?
Great!

16:30.390 --> 16:32.457
I mean, that's really
important to you, right?

16:32.459 --> 16:35.126
That we both
write our own?

16:35.128 --> 16:38.162
Yes.
It's very important.
It's the <i>most</i> important.

16:38.164 --> 16:41.199
It's the one chance we have
to stand up in front
of everybody

16:41.201 --> 16:46.004
And say how we really
feel about each other,
speak from our hearts.

16:46.006 --> 16:49.507
And I do love you
with all my heart.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.642
Me too.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.502
Noelle: Mirabella?
Come in!

17:51.504 --> 17:53.671
Seating emergency.
Total disaster. Come quick.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.140
Just a minute.
I'm gonna change.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.209
Sorry, duty calls.

18:01.113 --> 18:02.280
Noelle:
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

18:02.282 --> 18:05.149
I don't even know
who this person is.

18:05.151 --> 18:08.119
Young harper:
Am I in the right place?

18:08.121 --> 18:10.221
Surprise!

18:12.691 --> 18:13.858
And--and you are?

18:13.860 --> 18:15.827
You don't remember me?

18:15.829 --> 18:20.331
Debbie hayworth.
Second cousin once removed.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.334
Aunt marjorie's side?
Ohh. Okay,

18:23.336 --> 18:26.571
Your grandmother
and my great-uncle--

18:26.573 --> 18:28.106
I'm sorry,
too many details.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.141
You must be on
my mother's list.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.810
We played together
all the time as kids.

18:32.812 --> 18:36.781
Remember the treehouse
uncle eddie built in
the back of the barn?

18:36.783 --> 18:38.850
Of--of course!
The old treehouse!

18:38.852 --> 18:41.652
God, it's been forever.
You look so...

18:43.322 --> 18:47.291
So much like my mother
when she was young.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.127
Really?

18:49.129 --> 18:52.430
Yeah,
the spitting image.
It's weird.

18:52.432 --> 18:55.233
It's <i>really</i> weird.

18:55.235 --> 18:58.469
Aunt marjorie always
said the same thing.
And--and I said,

18:58.471 --> 19:00.304
"well, if I have to
look like somebody,

19:00.306 --> 19:01.839
I'm so glad
it's aunt harper."

19:01.841 --> 19:04.175
I mean, is she just
a timeless beauty, or what?

19:04.177 --> 19:06.410
And--and so talented.

19:06.412 --> 19:09.180
Aunt marjorie always
called her "superstar."

19:09.182 --> 19:10.915
I really hate to break up
the family reunion,

19:10.917 --> 19:13.351
But we have
a rehearsal dinner
nightmare on our hands.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.786
See?
Oh, gosh, these
italian family feuds.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.555
They last for 700 years.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.490
And I don't know where I'm gonna
put my great-aunt birdie.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.259
She came in
all the way from boston.

19:21.261 --> 19:25.196
Interesting color scheme.
Is that...Puce?

19:25.198 --> 19:27.398
Bold choice.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.667
I thought your mom said
you were going with

19:29.669 --> 19:32.203
Dusky rose
and gold accents.

19:32.205 --> 19:34.205
No, that's what her mom
<i>wanted</i> her to go with.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.174
Pink and gold are classics.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.241
Old-fashioned.

19:37.243 --> 19:39.210
Tasteful.
Boring.

19:43.782 --> 19:45.316
Oh, my gosh!

19:45.318 --> 19:47.885
Debbie,
you fixed it!
Thank you!

19:47.887 --> 19:51.289
Oh! You have <i>got</i> to come
to my bachelorette party.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.823
Bachelorette party?

19:52.825 --> 19:56.227
Oh, yeah, we're family.
You have to come.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.596
We have champagne
and mani-pedi's.
Mani-pedi's.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.331
Yay!
Yay!

20:00.333 --> 20:02.600
Well, I'll get
settled in, then.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.901
Okay.
All right.
All right.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.871
We'll see you
for mani-pedi's.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.573
All: Mani-pedi's!

20:11.310 --> 20:12.410
Amanda!

20:12.412 --> 20:14.612
The tonic.
What have you got?

20:14.614 --> 20:17.215
We have a bigger problem.

20:17.217 --> 20:20.218
I spoke to the investors.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.686
Amanda, the tonic.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.487
Harper, this is serious.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.923
You need to come home
right now. I can't do this.

20:25.925 --> 20:30.361
I am in a situation here,
amanda. I need information.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.230
What kind of situation?
How crazy

20:32.232 --> 20:34.732
<i>Is it over there?</i>

20:34.734 --> 20:35.933
( camera snaps )

20:38.270 --> 20:41.405
I'd say it's getting
pretty crazy, don't you think?

20:41.407 --> 20:42.974
Who's that?
She looks familiar.

20:42.976 --> 20:44.809
Are you in my office?
What?

20:44.811 --> 20:47.345
<i>Look around.</i>
<i>( sighs )</i>

20:56.388 --> 20:58.256
Aaaaah!

20:58.258 --> 20:59.790
<i>Amanda!</i>

21:01.893 --> 21:03.261
<i>Amanda.</i>

21:04.263 --> 21:05.263
Amanda?

21:05.265 --> 21:06.998
Who is this?

21:07.000 --> 21:09.500
It's <i>me,</i> amanda!
Now focus! The tonic!

21:09.502 --> 21:13.371
No, you're not.
That is impossible.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.939
You have worked
for me for 15 years.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.307
<i>We have mounted</i>

21:16.309 --> 21:17.441
22 productions together,
and turned

21:17.443 --> 21:19.310
<i>Three unknowns</i>
<i>into broadway stars.</i>

21:19.312 --> 21:23.014
And help me figure out
what is in this tonic
that turned me young,

21:23.016 --> 21:25.816
I will fire you
without hesitation or regret!

21:25.818 --> 21:26.984
Now pull yourself together!

21:26.986 --> 21:31.289
Oh, my god. It <i>is</i> you.

21:31.291 --> 21:34.025
Thank you.
What have you got?

21:34.027 --> 21:35.693
<i>Um...</i>

21:35.695 --> 21:39.063
Oh, god. The stuff
is really old, harper.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.998
It was used for

21:41.000 --> 21:43.301
<i>Rheumatism, gout, um...</i>

21:43.303 --> 21:45.936
Melancholia, and impotence.

21:45.938 --> 21:47.538
What about side effects?

21:47.540 --> 21:49.473
Well, I've already
looked online.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.776
The company's been
out of business
for decades.

21:57.683 --> 22:02.653
Find out: Does it wear off,
and if so, can I take more.
You got it? Find out.

22:19.971 --> 22:21.539
( exhales )

22:21.541 --> 22:24.342
The things I do
for my daughter.

22:29.614 --> 22:31.115
Hi.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.516
Hello.

22:32.518 --> 22:33.884
Debbie hayworth.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.386
Marco vitturi.

22:35.388 --> 22:38.789
You must be related to
mirabella. You look like her.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.859
She looks like me.
We're second cousins.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.095
Once removed.
Aunt marjorie's side.

22:44.097 --> 22:45.730
Right. Listen to this.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.498
"dear mirabella,

22:47.500 --> 22:49.600
"you are so beautiful.

22:49.602 --> 22:53.104
"I want to never sleep
or even blink again

22:53.106 --> 22:57.742
"just so I can stare at
your beautifulness forever...

22:57.744 --> 22:59.977
Until I die."

22:59.979 --> 23:02.480
Too over the top?

23:02.482 --> 23:06.050
Wow. That is, um...
Yeah, that's really bad.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.919
It's terrible.

23:08.921 --> 23:12.123
But it was mirabella's idea
for us to write our own vows
for the wedding,

23:12.125 --> 23:14.125
And...I don't know,

23:14.127 --> 23:16.794
I have no idea
what I'm gonna say.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.630
Looks to me like
you can't <i>stop</i> figuring out
what to say.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.031
True enough.

23:21.033 --> 23:24.902
Love can make you
a little crazy sometimes.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.405
That's not your reputation,
you know.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.140
Yeah. I know.

23:29.142 --> 23:32.076
Must be really hard
to give that up.

23:32.078 --> 23:35.413
Not really.

23:35.415 --> 23:39.116
Mirabella must be
very special to you.
Oh, she is.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.118
She has this--

23:41.120 --> 23:43.521
I mean, she's so--

23:43.523 --> 23:47.458
When we first met,
I was like--

23:47.460 --> 23:50.127
Oh, god.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.062
She's--everything.

23:52.064 --> 23:55.199
So it's kind of hard,
you know, to--

23:56.735 --> 23:59.770
She has <i>the</i> most
beautiful blue eyes.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.473
Yeah. Yeah,
she got those
from her dad.

24:02.475 --> 24:07.044
And this beautiful smile
where one side of her mouth
kind of turns up--

24:07.046 --> 24:10.147
Kind of like yours.
Think she's got a secret?

24:10.149 --> 24:14.852
Yeah, right.
Something, uh...Secret.

24:14.854 --> 24:18.489
Oh, and she--she has
these beautiful hands.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.925
Oh, dancer's hands.

24:20.927 --> 24:24.061
You're...A dancer too?

24:24.063 --> 24:26.030
Runs in the family.

24:28.500 --> 24:32.703
I'm--I'm sorry, have--
have we met before?

24:32.705 --> 24:35.773
Not in this lifetime.

24:35.775 --> 24:38.576
Are you sure? Because--
oh, I'm sure.

24:38.578 --> 24:41.979
You would definitely
remember meeting me.

24:41.981 --> 24:45.683
You know, for second cousins,
you and mirabella...

24:45.685 --> 24:49.086
Yes?
It's strange how much
you remind me of her.

24:56.962 --> 24:59.864
This is so going to work.

25:05.070 --> 25:07.071
Noelle, how many times
did you lose your virginity?

25:07.073 --> 25:09.773
I have no idea, but hey,

25:09.775 --> 25:13.143
If the stars align
I might lose it again
this weekend.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.513
( laughter )

25:15.515 --> 25:18.682
Seriously though, em,
you're so lucky to have
found a guy like marco.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.852
He's so hot and rich...

25:21.854 --> 25:25.756
And hot and rich! Hello!

25:25.758 --> 25:27.057
Okay, mirabella,
it's your turn.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.226
Oh, no.
Somebody else go.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.161
But your story's so good.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.531
Okay. She was 16 years old,

25:33.533 --> 25:36.000
She told her mom
she was spending the weekend
at a friend's house--

25:36.002 --> 25:37.735
I'm that friend,
that influence--
and instead,

25:37.737 --> 25:41.105
We snuck off to paris!
What?!

25:41.107 --> 25:44.141
I mean, wow.

25:44.143 --> 25:47.144
And there,
after staying up all night

25:47.146 --> 25:48.979
Walking the banks of the seine
hand in hand,

25:48.981 --> 25:51.282
Talking until sunrise,

25:51.284 --> 25:53.150
Whispering their life stories
to each other--

25:53.152 --> 25:55.953
Noelle, no!
You have got
to be kidding me.

25:55.955 --> 25:58.989
Our dear, sweet,
innocent mirabella

25:58.991 --> 26:03.327
Laid herself down
with that hot, sexy
french man

26:03.329 --> 26:07.064
And gave up
her precious flower.
At sixteen?!

26:07.066 --> 26:08.966
It was very romantic.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.635
By the end of the night
we knew everything
about each other

26:11.637 --> 26:13.904
And we were like
two ships passing.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.307
And he was really very sweet.
Wait a second.

26:16.309 --> 26:20.044
How the heck did you
get out of the country
without your mother knowing?

26:20.046 --> 26:22.179
Her mom was at
an out-of-town preview.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.648
Her dad gave us permission.
We told him it was
a class trip.

26:24.650 --> 26:26.584
My mom didn't even
notice I was gone.

26:26.586 --> 26:29.587
Okay, that is not fair.
She's a very busy woman.

26:29.589 --> 26:31.755
A single mom,
a demanding career--

26:31.757 --> 26:34.992
Debbie, my mom is, was,
and always will be

26:34.994 --> 26:37.928
Way too self-centered
to think about anybody
but herself.

26:37.930 --> 26:41.932
She took you to dance classes
three times a week
when you were a kid.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.341
Noelle:
What are you <i>doing?</i>

26:50.343 --> 26:52.309
The sun is very bad
for your skin.

26:52.311 --> 26:55.679
So, mirabella, tell me
about this french guy.

26:55.681 --> 26:57.281
Did you think
you were in love with him?

26:57.283 --> 27:00.818
Okay, uh, no.
I mean, it was
a great experience,

27:00.820 --> 27:03.053
But it wasn't like
how it is with marco.

27:03.055 --> 27:06.657
Right. Marco.
The playboy prince.

27:06.659 --> 27:10.194
I'm sorry. I just--
I read that.

27:10.196 --> 27:13.263
He retired that title
when he met me. Besides,
he's not a real prince.

27:13.265 --> 27:16.033
( laughter )
but he is a real italian.

27:16.035 --> 27:18.235
I wouldn't worry too much
about that, though.

27:18.237 --> 27:21.405
Not every italian guy
has to have a mistress,
right?

27:21.407 --> 27:24.074
Right?
I'm not worried about it.

27:24.076 --> 27:28.245
I knew marco was the right guy
right from the very beginning.

30:00.966 --> 30:03.200
Okay. Okay, okay.

30:03.202 --> 30:05.035
<i>The good news.</i>
<i>The trunk that the tonic</i>

Tom dorian.
<i>Never heard of him.</i>
<i>Is that it?</i>

30:09.975 --> 30:12.176
And now the not-so-good news.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.812
The investors found out about
mirabella leaving the show.

Oh, no! How?!
<i>One of the dancers</i>

30:17.449 --> 30:19.116
Spilled, and it gets worse.

30:19.118 --> 30:21.185
They're going to recast her.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.920
They can't do that.
<i>Yes,</i>

30:22.922 --> 30:24.421
They can. Look,

30:24.423 --> 30:25.989

30:25.991 --> 30:27.391
<i>Mirabella'd be back</i>

But if mirabella is not
back here for it,

30:29.829 --> 30:32.996
They're going to replace her.
And you.

30:32.998 --> 30:35.933
We don't need a new lead.
Mirabella is coming back.

30:35.935 --> 30:37.267
( laughing )
whoo!

30:37.269 --> 30:39.169
And they wouldn't dare
replace me.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.571
Why am I scared?

30:40.573 --> 30:42.039
Don't say anything to anybody.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.240
Tell them I will
be back on Monday

30:43.242 --> 30:44.975

<i>I</i> just did that.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.157

32:07.159 --> 32:09.059
Oh, my gosh,
I am so sorry!

32:09.061 --> 32:10.627
I don't know
what came over me!

32:10.629 --> 32:13.697
Maybe it was the champagne--
no, no, no,
you don't understand.

32:13.699 --> 32:18.135
I swore I was through
with other women, for good.

32:18.137 --> 32:22.673
Debbie, mirabella dared me
to be a better person,
and I thought I could.

32:22.675 --> 32:25.342
Because she believed in me
more than anyone has

32:25.344 --> 32:27.444
In my entire life.

32:29.580 --> 32:32.950
But now this?

32:32.952 --> 32:36.987
I don't think I can be
the man she wants me to be,

32:36.989 --> 32:39.156
Or the man she deserves.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.961
I'm not good enough
for her. Right?

32:46.130 --> 32:49.633
I'm sorry, debbie,
this isn't your fault.
It's mine.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.702
I have to go.

33:14.325 --> 33:16.693
Oh! This is it.

33:16.695 --> 33:20.464
Can you believe
I'm getting married tomorrow?

33:20.466 --> 33:22.733
No, I really can't.

33:25.103 --> 33:27.137
Debbie, what's wrong?

33:27.139 --> 33:29.039
Nothing. Nothing.

33:29.041 --> 33:32.075
I'm fine, it's just
this is the first time
I've seen you in your dress.

33:32.077 --> 33:36.213
It seems like just yesterday
you were a little girl.

33:36.215 --> 33:39.149
We. <i>We</i> were little girls.

33:39.151 --> 33:41.084
Dancing around
the back yard together,

33:41.086 --> 33:43.687
Playing with
each other's hair...

33:45.490 --> 33:49.459
This is the most
beautiful you've looked
in your entire life.

33:49.461 --> 33:51.228
Are you happy?

33:51.230 --> 33:53.263
Yes!

33:53.265 --> 33:55.232
How could I not be?

33:55.234 --> 33:58.068
I'm getting everything
that I ever wanted.

33:58.070 --> 34:03.206
But you're giving up
your dream to be a dancer
to stay here with marco.

34:03.208 --> 34:06.576
( laughs )
debbie.

34:06.578 --> 34:11.181
Can I...
Can I tell you a secret?

34:11.183 --> 34:14.184
I never wanted
to be a dancer.

34:14.186 --> 34:19.188
That was my mom's dream,
not mine.

34:20.123 --> 34:24.194
What? Never?

34:24.196 --> 34:28.632
I mean, maybe for
a little while,
when I was a kid.

34:28.634 --> 34:32.369
I mean,
I worshipped my mother.

34:32.371 --> 34:35.237
You remember, she was
this big glamorous star

34:35.239 --> 34:37.340
And everyone loved her.

34:37.342 --> 34:40.342
And I wanted to be
just like her...

34:40.344 --> 34:43.313
For a while.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.081
What happened?

34:45.083 --> 34:48.284
I grew up.

34:50.188 --> 34:54.524
I can't believe
you never said anything
to your mom.

34:54.525 --> 34:57.094
Well...

34:57.096 --> 35:00.130
I didn't want
to disappoint her.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.599
When my mom blew her knee out,

35:02.601 --> 35:05.268
She wanted me
to be the big star that...

35:05.270 --> 35:07.804
She couldn't be anymore.

35:07.806 --> 35:10.774
And when I met marco,

35:10.776 --> 35:16.313
I finally realized
I can't live my life for her,

35:16.315 --> 35:19.416
No matter how much I love her.

35:23.154 --> 35:25.288
It was like...

35:25.290 --> 35:27.524
The first time
marco and I met,

35:27.526 --> 35:29.759
I could hear this little voice
telling me,

35:29.761 --> 35:33.163
"this guy's the one."

35:33.165 --> 35:34.631
Ya know? Like...

35:34.633 --> 35:37.234
The future was talking to me,

35:37.236 --> 35:41.171
Telling me I had already
spent a whole lifetime with him.

35:41.173 --> 35:44.474
Does that sound crazy?

35:44.476 --> 35:47.210
No.

35:47.212 --> 35:50.881
It's the most romantic
thing I've ever heard.

35:50.883 --> 35:53.183
Woman:
Senorina mirabella?

35:55.220 --> 36:00.790
Oh. You know, I forgot
to thank you for standing in
for noelle today, debbie.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.359
I--

36:04.262 --> 36:07.297
I have no idea where
she could possibly be.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.201
Debbie, where are you going?

36:11.203 --> 36:13.470
See you at
the rehearsal dinner!

36:37.795 --> 36:40.297
( speaks italian )

36:44.902 --> 36:49.639
Scott: Dude,
you gotta slow down.
I can't keep up.

36:53.978 --> 36:57.681
But wait a sec.
She said <i>she</i> kissed <i>you?</i>

36:57.683 --> 36:59.449
Why are we freaking out
about this?

36:59.451 --> 37:02.919
Because I didn't stop her--
and I should have.

37:02.921 --> 37:07.224
I shouldn't have even
put myself in a situation
where that could have happened.

37:07.226 --> 37:08.959
I broke my promise
to mirabella.

37:08.961 --> 37:12.295
Dude, you only have to feel
guilty <i>after</i> the wedding,

37:12.297 --> 37:14.231
That's the whole point
of getting married.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.933
Sage advice from the guy
who defines a long-term
relationship

37:16.935 --> 37:18.768
As a three-day weekend in aspen.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.504
I promised her
I was done with other women.

37:21.506 --> 37:24.307
I don't know,
maybe I'm just not
cut out for monogamy.

37:24.309 --> 37:26.810
(laughing) fantastic!
I've got a number
of two swedish flight attendants

37:26.812 --> 37:29.980
Who can meet us on your boat
in three hours!

37:29.982 --> 37:32.616
What? I'm not
judging you, man.

37:32.618 --> 37:35.952
You weren't there.
She was like
some fairy creature.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.687
She put a spell on me.

37:37.689 --> 37:40.624
She had these
soulful brown eyes,
like a gypsy.

37:40.626 --> 37:45.695
And she smelled like
the perfume my mother
used to wear.

37:45.697 --> 37:48.365
It was weird. There was
something about her,

37:48.367 --> 37:51.368
Like...Magical.

37:54.839 --> 37:57.574
I have to cancel
the wedding.

38:00.811 --> 38:03.046
Oh, god, what have I done?

38:05.650 --> 38:07.951
I've got to fix this.

38:14.792 --> 38:17.727
Name?
Ryan hutton.
Father of the bride.

38:17.729 --> 38:20.330
Is harper hutton here?

38:20.332 --> 38:21.998
She is not on the list.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.035
About fifty,
eyes like a tiger shark.

38:25.037 --> 38:30.006
The unmistakable aroma
of chanel number 5 and pure evil
gives her away.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.608
Not on the list, sir.

38:31.610 --> 38:34.077
Keep an eye out.
She'll never be able
to stay away.

38:34.079 --> 38:36.479
I got your back.
Thanks.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.928
( voices outside )

38:56.934 --> 39:00.070
...About my age,
about this tall?

39:00.072 --> 39:02.005
Ryan.

39:13.984 --> 39:16.986
Mirabella: <i>Debbie,</i>
<i>are you in there?</i>

39:16.988 --> 39:20.056
Something's happened.
Debbie?

39:20.058 --> 39:22.826
(falsetto) I'm here.
<i>Can you come out?</i>

39:22.828 --> 39:24.127
I need to talk to you.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.129
Not feeling well!

39:26.131 --> 39:27.864
Why don't you
talk to noelle?

39:27.866 --> 39:30.734
That's just it,
I can't.

39:30.736 --> 39:33.670
<i>She and marco</i>
<i>kissed last night.</i>

39:34.638 --> 39:36.539
Just a sec!

39:36.541 --> 39:37.974
<i>Debbie, what's wrong?</i>

39:37.976 --> 39:40.977
I thought--you know,
didn't we sort of bond?

39:40.979 --> 39:44.714
<i>I haven't seen noelle</i>
<i>all day. She disappeared.</i>

39:44.716 --> 39:46.383
<i>I know it was her.</i>

39:46.385 --> 39:49.052
Debbie, are you okay?

39:49.054 --> 39:50.820
Not so good!

39:52.056 --> 39:54.090
I shouldn't go through
with it, right?

39:54.092 --> 39:57.627
<i>He kissed another girl.</i>
<i>He broke his promise to me.</i>

39:57.629 --> 39:59.062
What choice do I have?

39:59.064 --> 40:01.431
Oh...Oh...

40:01.433 --> 40:03.666
Debbie?

40:03.668 --> 40:05.969
<i>I can't go through with it.</i>

40:05.971 --> 40:07.470
Right?

40:07.472 --> 40:10.173
Oh...Ohh...

40:17.681 --> 40:19.182
Oh!

40:26.991 --> 40:28.792
Uhh! Uhh!

40:31.495 --> 40:32.896
Ohh!

40:39.904 --> 40:42.038
<i>Hi, this is amanda.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

40:42.040 --> 40:45.508
Amanda, where <i>are</i> you?
Call me back.

40:45.510 --> 40:50.046
I need to know does this stuff
work more than once! Ohh!

40:51.682 --> 40:54.684
Mirabella!
Dad!

40:54.686 --> 40:56.453
I'm so glad you're here!

40:56.455 --> 40:58.087
Oh, honey.

40:59.590 --> 41:01.825
Is she here?
Dad--

41:01.827 --> 41:05.695
I'm telling ya,
she won't be able to resist.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.931
Honey, what's wrong?

41:07.933 --> 41:11.134
Dad, I think
mom might have been right
about marco the whole time.

41:11.136 --> 41:14.037
Your mother hasn't been right
about anything since 1987

41:14.039 --> 41:16.840
When she said,
"let's name her mirabella."
noelle: Look who it is.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.208
Hi, noelle.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.746
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.

41:23.748 --> 41:25.648
Pre-wedding jitters,
I guess.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.083
Have you talked to her?

41:27.085 --> 41:29.252
Harper: <i>Oh!</i>
<i>What's that?</i>

41:29.254 --> 41:32.088
Sounds like an elephant
passing a kidney stone.

41:32.090 --> 41:34.157
Has to be debbie.
Who's debbie?

41:34.159 --> 41:36.926
Mirabella's cousin,
debbie hayworth?

41:36.928 --> 41:38.228
Never heard of her.

41:38.230 --> 41:42.832
Ooh. Too many
tequila shooters.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.668
Debbie, are you all right?
Mm-hmm.

41:45.670 --> 41:49.038
Okay, well, then you need
to suck it up,

41:49.040 --> 41:52.942
Because I have got a hangover
that could bring down a t-rex.

41:52.944 --> 41:55.712
After the dance-off
is all a blur.

41:55.714 --> 41:57.714

Harper?

45:17.748 --> 45:19.015
Harper.

45:43.207 --> 45:44.207
Oh, my--

45:54.118 --> 45:56.018
This is not
going to end well.

45:56.020 --> 45:58.054
( door opens )

45:58.056 --> 46:00.757
What are you doing?

46:00.759 --> 46:03.259
Why aren't you getting dressed
for the rehearsal dinner?

46:03.261 --> 46:08.231
I'm leaving.
Marco and noelle
kissed last night, remember?

46:08.233 --> 46:12.135
Moonlight magic. Gag.

46:12.137 --> 46:15.371
My mom was right
about him, debbie.
He's never gonna change.

46:15.373 --> 46:18.107
Have you...
Talked to him yet?

46:18.109 --> 46:20.343
No. I know that I have to--
don't. Don't!

46:20.345 --> 46:24.280
This could all just be
normal jitters. Cold feet.

46:26.283 --> 46:28.985
It's not just about
a kiss, debbie.

46:28.987 --> 46:30.520
Marco can't--

46:30.522 --> 46:33.523
He can't express
his feelings for me.

46:33.525 --> 46:38.094
Every single time
it comes up, he clams up.

46:38.096 --> 46:42.098
I just-- I think
that I made a big mistake.

46:43.467 --> 46:46.202
I don't think that
he's ready for marriage.

46:46.204 --> 46:50.173
That is not true.
It's not true. Marco <i>loves</i> you.

46:50.175 --> 46:54.043
Look, I know how you're feeling.
My ex cheated on me.

46:54.045 --> 46:58.314
And I bet that
you dumped him.
Oh, I did. But....

46:58.316 --> 47:00.883
I didn't dump him
because he cheated,

47:00.885 --> 47:04.987
I dumped him because he cheated
and lied to me about it.

47:04.989 --> 47:08.024
I gave him a chance
to come clean,

47:08.026 --> 47:10.259
But by then it was too late.

47:10.261 --> 47:14.897
That's terrible,
debbie. I'm sorry.

47:14.899 --> 47:17.166
Listen, I speak
from experience.

47:17.168 --> 47:20.102
If marco tells you the truth
about what happened,

47:20.104 --> 47:23.172
You will know that
it was just a stupid mistake

47:23.174 --> 47:25.208
And he is so sorry.

47:26.276 --> 47:28.911
Can you handle that?

47:28.913 --> 47:30.847
I don't know.

47:30.849 --> 47:33.883
We have this huge dance
in front of everyone

47:33.885 --> 47:35.618
At midnight after
the rehearsal dinner.

47:35.620 --> 47:38.855
It's a vitturi
family tradition.

47:38.857 --> 47:42.558
Okay. Give him until
midnight, then.

47:42.560 --> 47:44.894
Can you do that?

47:47.164 --> 47:49.632
Okay, until midnight.

47:49.634 --> 47:51.934
Good.

47:51.936 --> 47:54.570
How'd you get so smart
about this stuff?

47:54.572 --> 47:57.139
Because I have an old soul.

47:58.175 --> 47:59.976
It's gonna be okay,
pumpkin.

48:02.346 --> 48:05.114
"pumpkin"?
My mom calls me that.

48:05.116 --> 48:09.218
Does she?
That's so funny.
My mom calls me that too.

48:09.220 --> 48:11.153
All right, well,
I gotta go.

48:11.155 --> 48:13.422
But debbie,
what if he doesn't--

48:13.424 --> 48:16.092
Doesn't tell the truth?

48:16.094 --> 48:18.060
Mr. Hutton.

48:18.062 --> 48:20.062
I'm so glad you're here.

48:20.064 --> 48:21.397
Marco.

48:23.033 --> 48:26.035
Oh, I'm sorry I missed
your bachelor party.

48:26.037 --> 48:28.237
I hope you
behaved yourself.

48:28.239 --> 48:30.640
Well, actually,
I messed up.

48:30.642 --> 48:34.443
I got drunk, and I don't know
how it all happened,

48:34.445 --> 48:41.584
But it ended up
with me kissing someone
who is not mirabella.

48:41.586 --> 48:46.055
But it didn't mean anything,
and the other girl
kind of kissed me, really.

48:46.057 --> 48:50.092
But I made this promise
to mirabella that I was
through with all that.

48:50.094 --> 48:54.130
And now I don't
know what to do.

48:54.132 --> 48:56.299
Sit down.

48:59.136 --> 49:02.505
I want you to
look me in the eye
and tell me the truth--

49:02.507 --> 49:06.542
Do you love my daughter?
Absolutely.
With all my heart, sir.

49:06.544 --> 49:10.112
All right, then.
I can help you fix this,

49:10.114 --> 49:12.214
But you have to do
exactly what I say.

49:12.216 --> 49:14.350
I know I have to
tell her the truth.
<i>No.</i>

49:14.352 --> 49:17.153
Don't tell her the truth.

49:17.155 --> 49:20.122
You'll only end up hurting her,
and I don't want that to happen.

49:20.124 --> 49:23.359
Believe it or not,
I was once in your shoes--

49:23.361 --> 49:26.295
And <i>now</i> look at me.
You're divorced.

49:26.297 --> 49:29.532
Exactly.
Because I told the truth!

49:29.534 --> 49:35.137
You know, your divorce
is why mirabella is
so worried about me.

49:35.139 --> 49:38.007
It was really hard on her.
I know it was.

49:38.009 --> 49:41.544
Telling mirabella the truth
won't change anything.

49:41.546 --> 49:44.013
I don't want to lie to her.

49:44.015 --> 49:47.183
If you love her,
you    <i>ha</i> to lie.

49:47.185 --> 49:50.619
You can't tell her the truth,
no matter what.

49:50.621 --> 49:52.521
Clear?

49:54.124 --> 49:56.025
All right.

49:56.027 --> 49:57.994
Hey, where ya goin'?

49:59.997 --> 50:02.264
To talk to a ghost.

50:04.668 --> 50:07.603
Oh! Where did that boy go?

50:08.739 --> 50:10.306
Harper.

50:10.308 --> 50:13.476
It <i>is</i> you!
It is not!

50:13.478 --> 50:15.311
What the hell's
going on here?

50:15.313 --> 50:18.147
How can--how can you
look like this?

50:18.149 --> 50:20.649
I'm sure I don't know you,
so if you'll just excuse me--

50:20.651 --> 50:24.020
Harper, your ass.
What?

50:24.022 --> 50:26.689
I recognized it
in the bathroom.

50:26.691 --> 50:30.626
I know that ass.
I fell in love with that ass.

50:30.628 --> 50:34.096
God help me, I spent
the better part of the eighties
worshipping that ass.

50:34.098 --> 50:35.264
Really?

50:35.266 --> 50:37.633
It <i>is</i> you.

50:38.702 --> 50:42.171
Hello, ryan.
It's been a while.

50:43.740 --> 50:46.308
I need a drink.
I'll get it for you.
Come.

50:49.079 --> 50:51.113
I also need a priest.

50:51.115 --> 50:54.183
Gotta be a priest
around here somewhere,
this is Italy.

50:54.185 --> 50:56.218
Where are
all the priests?

50:56.220 --> 50:58.487
Oh, my god. Will you stop
being so dramatic?

50:58.489 --> 51:00.456
I have a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

51:00.458 --> 51:03.559
There is <i>nothing</i>
<i>reasonable about this--</i>
<i>or you.</i>

51:03.561 --> 51:05.361
Okay, just take
a deep breath--

51:05.363 --> 51:08.130
Don't--
don't tell me what to do.

51:12.736 --> 51:14.403
Where are you going?

51:14.405 --> 51:17.706
To find a cop.
This can't be legal.

51:35.492 --> 51:37.393
( coughing )

51:38.728 --> 51:40.663
W-what happened?

51:40.665 --> 51:43.265
You're going to be
very angry.

51:43.267 --> 51:45.701
Distinct possibility,
if you're involved
in any way.

51:45.703 --> 51:47.803
My knee was the size
of a grapefruit, ryan,

51:47.805 --> 51:50.339
And--and there was this tonic,
and it is <i>magical.</i>

51:50.341 --> 51:52.274
And I took a sip
and I turned young.

51:52.276 --> 51:54.110
Amanda found it
in the back of the theater--

51:54.112 --> 51:55.711
Lord knows how long
that's been there--
but I had no choice.

51:55.713 --> 51:58.147
So in a way,
it's kind of like fate.

51:58.149 --> 51:59.682
And I hated marco,
I hated him,

51:59.684 --> 52:04.253
But it turns out
he really loves her,
and she really loves him back,

52:04.255 --> 52:09.358
And okay, I admit,
I originally came here
to stop the wedding--at first.

52:09.360 --> 52:12.161
But    <i>the</i> you know,
as it turns out,

52:12.163 --> 52:14.897
I, um, I kissed him...
Of course.

52:14.899 --> 52:17.900
And now it's all gone
terribly wrong somehow.

52:17.902 --> 52:20.569
Well, then,
you haven't
lost your touch.

52:23.740 --> 52:25.841
This isn't a joke, ryan.

52:25.843 --> 52:29.478
Seriously, harper, how could
you do something like this
to our daughter?

52:29.480 --> 52:32.448
I know, I know,
it's terrible.

52:32.450 --> 52:34.817
Are you mad?
Hold on.

52:34.819 --> 52:38.220
Did you drug me?
Of   <i>cours</i> i drugged you.

52:38.222 --> 52:41.524
You were gonna drop the dime
on me. Plus, I really need
your help with this.

52:41.526 --> 52:43.225
You...Drugged me!

52:43.227 --> 52:45.194
I was <i>thinking</i>
<i>about our daughter!</i>

52:45.196 --> 52:46.795
Oh, sure you were!

52:55.939 --> 52:57.840
Wha--

53:00.877 --> 53:02.478
Aaaah!

53:07.684 --> 53:08.851
Right.

53:10.353 --> 53:11.687
Ryan?

53:11.689 --> 53:13.222
Ryan!
Hmm...

53:13.224 --> 53:15.558
Ryan. Ryan.
Huhh!

53:15.560 --> 53:17.927
What did you
do to me this time?

53:17.929 --> 53:19.695
Whose voice is that?

53:19.697 --> 53:22.798
Is that--(coughs)--
(shrill) hey, that's me!

53:22.800 --> 53:24.934
(deeper)
hey, that's <i>me.</i>

53:24.936 --> 53:27.670
Why do I sound so weird,
harper?!

53:31.208 --> 53:35.277
Oh, my god.
Harper, this...

53:35.279 --> 53:36.579
Is a miracle.

53:36.581 --> 53:38.781
I know, I know,
you're young,

53:38.783 --> 53:40.950
I've been there,
I've done that.
Listen to me.

53:40.952 --> 53:44.520
Yeah!
I have ruined our daughter's
one chance at love.

53:44.522 --> 53:45.921
So I need you to
help me fix it.

53:45.923 --> 53:48.757
Yeah, well, you can check that
off your to-do list,

53:48.759 --> 53:51.627
Because I already fixed it.
What do you mean?

53:51.629 --> 53:53.929
Marco spilled
the whole can of beans.

53:53.931 --> 53:58.901
I told him no witness,
no crime. Just deny
till he dies.

53:58.903 --> 54:00.236
It's all good.

54:00.238 --> 54:02.304
No. Ryan! No--

54:02.306 --> 54:03.939
Ryan!!!

54:03.941 --> 54:07.776
Mirabella overhead marco
talking about the kiss.

54:07.778 --> 54:10.279
He   <i>ha</i> to confess.
Uh-oh.

54:10.281 --> 54:12.781
Yeah. I told her that
if he tells her the truth,

54:12.783 --> 54:14.817
That means he loves her
and she can trust him.

54:14.819 --> 54:18.020
So if he doesn't tell her,
she'll just think he's
trying to cover it up

54:18.022 --> 54:21.657
And that means
he'll cheat on her again.
We have to fix this.

54:21.659 --> 54:26.962
Wow. To see your mind at work
is at once fascinating
and repugnant.

54:26.964 --> 54:30.666
Oh, my god.
You are completely useless.
I remember why I divorced you.

54:30.668 --> 54:32.268
It was not a divorce--

54:32.270 --> 54:33.969
It was an exorcism!

54:33.971 --> 54:37.039
You cheated on me!
One time!
Mid-life crisis.

54:37.041 --> 54:38.707
And then you lied about it.

54:38.709 --> 54:41.310
And when I told the truth,
you kicked me out!

54:41.312 --> 54:42.945
We do not
have time for this.

54:42.947 --> 54:44.947
Where could marco be?
Think, ryan.

54:44.949 --> 54:48.917
Think? I can't think
because I'm 30 years younger
than I was 20 minutes ago!

54:48.919 --> 54:51.287
I can't believe
you got me into this!

54:51.289 --> 54:53.989
Wait-- yes, I can.

54:53.991 --> 54:59.061
Okay, look, I just read
this guy's diary on the plane,

54:59.063 --> 55:01.297
Oh my god,
I hope I'm not too late.

55:01.299 --> 55:04.767
Look, whatever happens,
do <i>not</i> take a third dose.

55:04.769 --> 55:06.568
( disconnects )

55:11.741 --> 55:13.876
Mirabella.

55:13.878 --> 55:16.011
Wow. You look...

55:17.947 --> 55:20.616
What's wrong?
Nothing.

55:20.618 --> 55:23.419
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.

55:23.421 --> 55:26.055
So we're both good.
We're great.

55:28.958 --> 55:31.660
Look...

55:31.662 --> 55:34.430
I don't want any secrets
between us.

55:34.432 --> 55:38.067
That's not the way
to start a marriage.

55:38.069 --> 55:39.601
I totally agree.

55:41.538 --> 55:46.041
So...You would tell me the truth
about anything stupid

55:46.043 --> 55:47.976
You might have done
in the past?

55:47.978 --> 55:52.681
Distant, recent, whatever?

55:54.117 --> 55:57.519
Well, um, mirabella,

55:57.521 --> 56:02.524
What I'm trying to say
is that, well, I...

56:02.526 --> 56:04.960
Wait! He's gonna tell her.

56:04.962 --> 56:06.895
Um...

56:08.798 --> 56:11.800
Of <i>course</i> I would.

56:11.802 --> 56:15.104
If I had something,
you know, to confess.

56:15.106 --> 56:16.972
( grunts )

56:16.974 --> 56:18.841
Damn.

56:22.612 --> 56:24.813
Mirabella...

56:24.815 --> 56:26.949
Young harper:
I've seriously messed this up.

56:26.951 --> 56:28.984
And how.

56:28.986 --> 56:31.019
Okay,
what's our plan?

56:31.021 --> 56:33.689
Ha! "our" plan?

56:40.697 --> 56:42.998
Would you stop, <i>please,</i>
look what I can do!
How long does th <i>ohh! Ow!</i> Last?

56:43.000 --> 56:46.635
And help me? We only
have until midnight when
the rehearsal dinner ends.

56:46.637 --> 56:49.638
I can't help it.
This stuff <i>really</i> works.

56:49.640 --> 56:51.774
Of course it works.
It's--(gasps )--

56:51.776 --> 56:54.843
Oh, my gosh, the tonic!
I left it at the bar!

57:14.764 --> 57:16.098
Hmm.

57:24.574 --> 57:27.810
No! No, no!
Where is it?
I don't see it.

57:28.978 --> 57:30.979
( gasps )
what?

57:30.981 --> 57:33.615
Oh. What happened?

57:33.617 --> 57:35.684
Oh, aunt birdie.

57:35.686 --> 57:38.654
She must have chugged
the whole bottle.

57:38.656 --> 57:42.124
What's that
gonna do to her?

57:42.126 --> 57:44.593
I don't want to know.

57:44.595 --> 57:46.929
Aunt birdie?

57:48.097 --> 57:49.064
( gasps )

57:49.066 --> 57:50.833
Oh, my god.
What?

57:53.903 --> 57:55.971
There goes great-aunt birdie.

57:55.973 --> 57:59.007
Proud matriarch
of the hayworth line.

57:59.009 --> 58:01.777
Wow.
She's got some moves.
Runs in the family.

58:01.779 --> 58:05.180
You have really
screwed this up.

58:10.987 --> 58:13.755
( music, chatter )

58:13.757 --> 58:16.959
( whispering )

58:16.961 --> 58:20.596
Hey. I am debbie,
and you are...?
Angus.

58:20.598 --> 58:22.965
Angus?
Angus.

58:22.967 --> 58:27.102
Okay, we only have
until midnight to
get this fixed, <i>angus.</i>

58:27.104 --> 58:31.106
Hey. I know it goes
completely against
your nature

58:31.108 --> 58:34.576
And ever fiber of your being
is screaming at you
to do the opposite,

58:34.578 --> 58:36.745
But you have to
tell the truth.

58:36.747 --> 58:39.615
Let marco off the hook
for this kiss, harper.

58:39.617 --> 58:41.984
Tell him <i>you</i> kissed <i>him.</i>

58:41.986 --> 58:44.086
He's gotta understand
none of this was his fault.

58:44.088 --> 58:46.655
It's the only way
to fix this mess.

58:46.657 --> 58:48.156
You're right.

58:48.158 --> 58:50.125
Ugh!

58:50.127 --> 58:52.961
God, I <i>hate</i> it
when that happens.

58:56.666 --> 58:59.601
Noelle: No, I'm serious.
You look <i>amazing.</i>

58:59.603 --> 59:02.304
Oh, the bride-to-be is here.

59:02.306 --> 59:04.139
Mirabella.

59:05.275 --> 59:07.209
Hey.
Mirabella: Hi.

59:07.211 --> 59:10.979
Thanks for ruining my life.
I thought we were
best friends.

59:10.981 --> 59:14.116
Excuse me?
Back up a sec.
You can drop the act,

59:14.118 --> 59:17.286
Because I know that
you and marco kissed last night.

59:17.288 --> 59:19.555
What are you <i>talking</i> about?

59:19.557 --> 59:21.723
I heard him and scott
talking about it
under the bridge.

59:21.725 --> 59:26.028
"soulful brown eyes,
full of life,
embracing the moment."

59:26.030 --> 59:29.831
Mirabella, I was
really drunk last night,
but I wasn't <i>that</i> drunk.

59:29.833 --> 59:31.934
"mirabella,
you're so lucky!

59:31.936 --> 59:34.102
He's so hot and rich,
<i>and</i> hot and rich!"

59:34.104 --> 59:35.571
Okay, fine!
I was plastered.

59:35.573 --> 59:37.306
After I left you guys, I--

59:37.308 --> 59:40.042
I hit up the bachelor party...

59:40.044 --> 59:44.646
And I can't remember
much after that.
Convenient.

59:44.648 --> 59:48.283
We've been best friends
since seventh grade.
I would never hurt you.

59:48.285 --> 59:55.057
Besides, I'm not
the only one around here
with brown eyes.

59:55.059 --> 59:58.026
The jig is up!
No, no, no! She can't
find out it was me!

59:58.028 --> 01:00:00.095
What do we do?

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:02.631
We have to
convince her

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:06.602
That there's no way debbie
would have kissed marco.

01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:09.237
Okay, how do we do that?

01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:12.207
Hey! Hey, hey--
hey, wait.

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:14.076
We lay it on thick.

01:00:14.078 --> 01:00:16.211
Come on.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.648

No, don't--
hello?
<i>Dad, where have you been?</i>

01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:05.240
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

01:04:05.242 --> 01:04:07.342
Hey, honey. What's up?

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:09.010
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:12.047
Who    that guy?
And how did I miss him?
Uh....

01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:14.049
<i>Upstairs. Uh, I'm...</i>

01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:15.483
Jet lagged.

01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:18.220
<i>You sound weird.</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:04:18.222 --> 01:04:20.121
I do feel
very strange right now.

01:04:20.123 --> 01:04:21.489
<i>I'm not myself at all.</i>

01:04:21.491 --> 01:04:24.860
I'm gonna
go find marco.

01:04:24.862 --> 01:04:28.063
Dad...
<i>What is it, honey?</i>

01:04:28.065 --> 01:04:29.531
<i>I'm so confused.</i>

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:31.366
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>I can go through</i>

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:33.168
With this wedding.

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:44.045
It's just that mom said
mthat he would never
mbe faithful to me.

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:46.214
<i>And then debbie said</i>
<i>the way I could find</i>
<i>if he would be</i>

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:48.250
<i>Is if he confessed to</i>
<i>kissing noelle last night,</i>

01:04:48.252 --> 01:04:50.018
<i>Because that would mean</i>
<i>that he's sorry,</i>
<i>and he didn't.</i>

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:53.054
And I think that it speaks
to a larger character flaw,

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:57.659
And on top if it all,
he can't even tell me
how he feels about me.

01:04:57.661 --> 01:04:59.327
Honey, listen.

01:04:59.329 --> 01:05:01.429
<i>People are human.</i>
<i>They make mistakes.</i>

01:05:01.431 --> 01:05:04.299
I made a lot of mistakes
with your mom.

01:05:04.301 --> 01:05:06.568
And she definitely
punished me for it.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:08.103
But I never stopped loving her

01:05:08.105 --> 01:05:09.204
Through any of it.

01:05:09.206 --> 01:05:11.907
<i>Even asset seizure?</i>
<i>All the lawyers</i>

01:05:11.909 --> 01:05:14.109
In the world weren't able
to change the way
I feel about her.

01:05:14.111 --> 01:05:17.545
So then why
did you cheat on her?

01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:25.553
( sighs )
because I was selfish...

01:05:25.555 --> 01:05:30.225
And lonely and...Insecure.

01:05:30.227 --> 01:05:34.062
Your mom was a real star,
honey.

01:05:34.064 --> 01:05:37.299
When she blew out her knee,
I wasn't sad. I was thrilled.

01:05:37.301 --> 01:05:39.034
I thought, finally

01:05:39.036 --> 01:05:41.303
I don't have to share her
with the rest of the world.

01:05:41.305 --> 01:05:43.705
But that didn't happen.
She went right back to work

01:05:43.707 --> 01:05:47.008
And became
the star choreographer,
the one everyone

01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:49.110
Wanted to work with,
everyone adored.

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:52.247
And there I was,
still nobody,

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:54.316
Holding her coat
at parties.

01:05:54.318 --> 01:05:57.185
Dad, I had no idea.

01:05:57.187 --> 01:06:02.624
What I did to her was
the biggest mistake of my life.

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:07.128
I think I must have always
hoped for a second chance.

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:10.065
But I never thought
I'd get it.

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:12.534
I never felt I deserved it.

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:19.174
After you cheated on mom,
she couldn't trust you anymore.

01:06:19.176 --> 01:06:21.109
<i>And now I know why.</i>

01:06:23.245 --> 01:06:25.113
And I can't trust marco.
<i>No--</i>

01:06:25.115 --> 01:06:27.082
He loves you, honey.

01:06:27.084 --> 01:06:28.316
<i>Really?</i>

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:30.552
Where's the proof?

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:32.454
<i>He can't even</i>
<i>talk to me anymore.</i>

01:06:32.456 --> 01:06:36.691
I can't go through
with this wedding.
I'm going home.

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:38.593
Mirabella--

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:48.203
Damn.

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:53.641
♪ ( dance music )

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:01.683
Oh, no! Not now!

01:07:20.603 --> 01:07:21.736
Hello?

01:07:21.738 --> 01:07:25.040
Mrs. Hutton?

01:07:25.042 --> 01:07:27.542
What are you doing here?

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:30.378
I know I'm not
supposed to be here.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.214
If you came to stop the wedding,
you're too late.

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:35.216
The wedding's not happening.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:37.419
I know. I spoke to debbie.
She told me everything.

01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:40.121
What? W-why?
We're very close.

01:07:40.123 --> 01:07:42.257
You were right about me
all along.

01:07:42.259 --> 01:07:46.528
I broke my promise to her,
and then I lied about it.
When mirabella finds out--

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:49.197
Marco, shut up.

01:07:49.199 --> 01:07:51.132
I flew all the way here
to tell you.

01:07:51.134 --> 01:07:55.336
I know debbie.
I've known her
all her life.

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:58.206
She's a rare
and beautiful creature--

01:07:58.208 --> 01:08:00.809
Incomparable, actually,
one of a kind.

01:08:00.811 --> 01:08:03.711
But she has a problem
letting go.

01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:06.748
She loves mirabella.

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:08.650
They used to be
very close...

01:08:08.652 --> 01:08:11.719
When they were younger.
Really?

01:08:11.721 --> 01:08:16.724
Debbie pushed herself on you.
She wanted to prove that
you weren't good enough.

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:20.161
But why would she do that?
She doesn't even know me.

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:22.197
She...

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:25.300
Had her heart broken
a long time ago.

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:28.136
She loved a man
more than she wanted to,

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:32.207
And it made her feel
out of control, and...

01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:34.442
And he cheated on her.

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:39.214
I don't know, I guess
she just stopped believing
in love after that.

01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:42.517
And when mirabella
met you...

01:08:42.519 --> 01:08:45.752
The playboy prince?
It was like deja vu.

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:48.555
Debbie expected
the worst from you,

01:08:48.558 --> 01:08:53.228
And when the worst
didn't happen on its own,
she made it happen.

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:58.198
She made a <i>terrible</i> mistake,
and she is so sorry, marco.

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:03.604
I know I never
approved of you,

01:09:03.607 --> 01:09:06.875
But I was wrong--
I should have
given you a chance.

01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:10.478
You're a good man.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.814
Don't give up
on mirabella.

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:15.183
I think she might have
given up on <i>me.</i>

01:09:15.185 --> 01:09:19.187
Go. Look for her.
Tell her how much
you love her.

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:22.256
I don't think
she'll believe me.
Prove it to her.

01:09:22.259 --> 01:09:23.892
Find a way.

01:09:23.894 --> 01:09:25.560
I'll try.

01:09:52.921 --> 01:09:55.757
Oh, ryan, look at you.

01:09:55.759 --> 01:09:58.293
The tonic didn't
last very long, did it?

01:09:58.295 --> 01:10:01.296
Probably from trying
to keep up with you
on the dance floor

01:10:01.298 --> 01:10:02.730
Like back in the day.

01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:04.732
I knew I still
had it in me.

01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:06.701
(groans)
now I have proof.

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:09.204
Oh, my gosh. Proof!
Wha--

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:11.539
What?

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:14.442
What are we doing?

01:10:14.444 --> 01:10:16.811
We're looking for a book.
A big book.

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:19.280
What's in the book?
Marco's wedding vows.

01:10:19.282 --> 01:10:20.448
We have to find it--

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:23.918
( men speaking italian )

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.955
What the hell
are you doing?
I'm trying to hide you.

01:10:26.957 --> 01:10:30.225
Ryan, they're on marco's side.
They don't even know me.

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:32.994
Oh. I didn't think of that.
I'm sorry.

01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:36.898
Apology accepted.
Actually, you're still
a pretty good kisser.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.600
You're not bad yourself.

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:45.840
It's locked!
Why is it locked?!

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:48.309
How important is it
to get into this greenhouse?

01:10:48.311 --> 01:10:51.646
The future happiness
of our daughter may
depend on it.

01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:53.848
All right.
Get out of the way.

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:56.951
Ohh! Oh...

01:10:56.953 --> 01:10:59.287
That was a bad idea.
Are you all right?

01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:02.023
Ahhh. Yeah. Yeah.

01:11:02.025 --> 01:11:04.325
Oh...

01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:07.562
I'm so sorry, harper.
For what?

01:11:07.564 --> 01:11:10.565
I don't know.
For all of it.

01:11:10.567 --> 01:11:12.934
Everything I didn't do,
everything I did.

01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:15.303
Well, it was
a long time ago.

01:11:15.305 --> 01:11:17.505
Not so long.

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:22.510
Ever since we split up
I feel like I've been living
someone else's life.

01:11:22.512 --> 01:11:25.913
I love you, harper.
I miss you.

01:11:25.915 --> 01:11:27.749
I want to come home.

01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:31.452
I love you too,
you idiot.

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:33.321
( laughs )

01:11:33.323 --> 01:11:36.024
I always have.

01:11:36.026 --> 01:11:39.027
Now let's finish this--
for mirabella.

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:53.508
( sighs )
which ones are the vows?

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:55.843
I think all of them.

01:11:55.845 --> 01:11:58.946
Grab as many as you can.
And do what?

01:11:58.948 --> 01:12:03.851
We have to find mirabella.
You have to show these to her

01:12:03.853 --> 01:12:07.922
So you can prove that
marco really loves her.

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:11.025
You think
that's gonna work?
It has to.

01:12:11.027 --> 01:12:14.028
Come on.
Right behind you.

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:21.102
Where are you going?

01:12:21.104 --> 01:12:23.538
Where does it
look like I'm going?

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:24.939
Wait.
I-I have to tell you--

01:12:24.941 --> 01:12:27.375
What?!

01:12:27.377 --> 01:12:31.012
Go ahead, marco,
tell me how you really
feel about me.

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:35.383
You're--you look--um...

01:12:35.385 --> 01:12:39.020
Well, um...Um--

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:41.989
Wait. Give me a second.

01:12:41.991 --> 01:12:46.027
I'm sorry. I don't know
what's wrong with me.

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:49.664
Whenever
I'm around you lately,
I can't speak.

01:12:49.666 --> 01:12:54.068
I know. All right?
About the kiss.

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:57.038
So there's nothing
left to say.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.840
But there is.

01:12:58.842 --> 01:13:00.975
I love you <i>so</i> much.

01:13:00.977 --> 01:13:02.877
I know what
I did was wrong.

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:05.113
I should have never
let it happen.

01:13:05.115 --> 01:13:07.615
So then why <i>did</i> you?
I don't know.

01:13:07.617 --> 01:13:11.619
But all I can think about
since it happened
is how much I hurt you.

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:18.459
Oh-- this way.

01:13:18.461 --> 01:13:19.961
Come on.

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:26.968
Marco: <i>...So beautiful...</i>
<i>This is crazy.</i>

01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:29.070
<i>I can--I want to never...</i>
<i>Do you hear that?</i>

01:13:29.072 --> 01:13:30.638
What?

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.107
Just talk to me.

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:38.813
Tell me right now
in your own words
why you want to marry me.

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:44.585
It's them.

01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:52.994
Wait!

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:06.007
What is this?

01:14:08.143 --> 01:14:09.544
Here, take some.

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:25.159
"to mirabella
on our wedding day."

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:28.763
Are these...
Your vows?

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:35.136

Still?
<i>Always.</i>

01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:30.985
Oh, harper,
thanks god!

01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:33.588
Amanda!
I have been driving around
these back roads for hours.

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:36.090
This place is
impossible to find.
What are you doing--

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:38.092
Move away from that bottle.
Why? What--

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:40.661
Harper, the third dose
is permanent.

01:16:40.663 --> 01:16:43.097
Permanent?
Yes, as in "forever."

01:16:43.099 --> 01:16:46.033
And that's a bad thing
because...?
( sighs )

01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:47.768
What?

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:51.072
I mean, we're talking
about immortality here.

01:16:51.074 --> 01:16:54.942
This is an unimaginable gift--
to be young forever?

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:58.145
You can't just throw this away
without even considering it.

01:16:58.147 --> 01:17:02.216
No, no, no.
It's not a gift,
it's a <i>curse.</i>

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:07.755
There's only
one dose left here.

01:17:07.757 --> 01:17:11.158
You were going to be
the biggest star broadway
had ever seen.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.928
The stage, the fans,
the spotlight...

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:17.632
And it all would have
happened for you, except...

01:17:17.634 --> 01:17:19.867
My knee.

01:17:19.869 --> 01:17:23.337
You can have that
all back now.

01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:27.341
You can be the new star
of your show.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:33.814
I could, couldn't I?

01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:38.052
And you really
want that for me?

01:17:38.054 --> 01:17:41.255
I just want to
make you happy, harper.

01:17:41.257 --> 01:17:44.859
That's all I've ever wanted
from the first day we met.

01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:47.061
I've just never been
very good at it.

01:17:47.063 --> 01:17:49.430
So...Yes.

01:17:49.432 --> 01:17:53.067
If this is what
makes you happy,
this is what I want.

01:17:53.069 --> 01:17:55.903
No, no, no, no.
Don't be crazy, harper.

01:17:55.905 --> 01:18:01.142
You will lose everything.
Can you really say goodbye
to mirabella forever?

01:18:01.144 --> 01:18:04.011
Never see your grandkids?

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:08.149
Come on. You can't
give all that up.

01:18:08.151 --> 01:18:10.384
It's your choice,
harper.

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:26.701
You were the most handsome man
I'd ever seen.

01:19:04.439 --> 01:19:07.108
Noelle: Girl, I cannot believe
but you look so hot! Married.
Thank you.

01:19:15.383 --> 01:19:17.418
Mom.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.220
What are you doing here?

01:19:19.222 --> 01:19:22.356
Hi, mrs. Hutton.

01:19:22.358 --> 01:19:25.326
I'm gonna leave you two
to talk.

01:19:29.865 --> 01:19:32.266
I know. I'm banned.

01:19:33.368 --> 01:19:36.470
But I've had time
to think about it.

01:19:36.472 --> 01:19:40.775
I've just been so wrong
about everything.

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:45.379
I was--
I was wrong about marco.

01:19:45.381 --> 01:19:48.783
So wrong.
He's a wonderful guy.

01:19:48.785 --> 01:19:53.187
And he loves you,
and love is what
really matters.

01:19:57.425 --> 01:20:00.261
I mean, everything else
fades away, but love lasts.

01:20:02.531 --> 01:20:06.233
And I'm so proud of you
for knowing that...

01:20:06.235 --> 01:20:08.169
And following your heart.

01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:15.209
You still mad at me?

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:20.981
Can I come to your wedding?

01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:26.287
I couldn't do it
without you.

01:20:26.289 --> 01:20:27.521
Oh!

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:32.426
Oh, I love you so much,
pumpkin.

01:20:32.428 --> 01:20:35.496
I love you more
than you'll ever know.

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:41.869
How did I ever get
such a smart girl?

01:20:41.871 --> 01:20:45.172
(laughs) I don't know.
I guess I had a good teacher.

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:50.110
Wait.
What about the show?

01:20:50.112 --> 01:20:52.279
( laughs )

01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:56.450
Today is about
celebrating your dreams,
not mine.

01:20:58.954 --> 01:21:03.123
Today my daughter
is getting married! Ha!

01:21:04.626 --> 01:21:09.129
Who are you
and what have you done
with my mother?

01:21:09.131 --> 01:21:13.567
Oh...It's just
a brand-new me.

01:21:13.569 --> 01:21:16.136
Oh. You have got to see
cousin debbie.

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:19.373
She reminds me
so much of you.
Really?

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:22.610
Then she must be
quite a girl.

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:25.446
Come on.

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:38.893

kiss the bride.
