[Narrator]<i> Previously on Sistas.</i>

00:07.173 --> 00:09.576
This ain't over bro, I promise
you bro and everything.

00:09.576 --> 00:11.478
Fatima, if I take this then he
gonna win.

00:11.478 --> 00:14.681
-I'm not touching that.
-Zac, stop, he's not worth it.

00:14.681 --> 00:15.682
I don't know.

00:16.049 --> 00:18.985
-Come on, Andi, you know.
-I've been told.

00:18.985 --> 00:21.955
-What did he hit you with?
-Baseball bat.

00:21.955 --> 00:24.257
All you have to do is sign this
paperwork

00:24.624 --> 00:26.760
and you'll be out of
here in an hour.

00:26.760 --> 00:27.727
Go ahead and sign.

00:31.234 --> 00:32.902
-Whatever.
-I'm telling you, she did it.

00:32.902 --> 00:35.872
-I don't believe you.
-She really signed it.

00:36.372 --> 00:40.043
And you expect for me to believe
you?

00:40.043 --> 00:41.411
Well you don't have to,

00:41.411 --> 00:44.313
I can show you the document
with her signature.

00:45.281 --> 00:48.518
Oh boo,
I'm not that dumb, bitch.

00:48.518 --> 00:52.021
I'm from the hood.
I don't fall for reindeer games.

00:52.021 --> 00:55.091
That little shit you do will
never work on a bitch like me.

00:55.091 --> 00:59.195
Well then let me show you the
video of her signing.

00:59.195 --> 01:00.596
Oh, there's a video.

01:01.330 --> 01:05.735
Wow, how do I know that that is
this document in this video?

01:05.735 --> 01:08.504
-Well look at it.
-Go to hell.

01:11.374 --> 01:14.310
-Okay, I'm trying to help you.
-Help me?

01:14.310 --> 01:17.447
By lying?
And feeding me this bullshit?

01:17.447 --> 01:18.915
You think it's bullshit?

01:18.915 --> 01:19.816
I know it's bullshit

01:20.283 --> 01:23.086
because Sabrina would never do
anything like this to me.

01:23.086 --> 01:24.554
Well you'd be surprised what
people will do

01:24.554 --> 01:26.456
when they find
themselves facing 30 years.

01:26.456 --> 01:29.258
-30 years?
-[John]<i> Oh, you didn't know.</i>

01:29.926 --> 01:33.930
Yeah, that's what I'm asking
for.

01:35.131 --> 01:38.735
-But we didn't do shit.
-Well, that's not what she says.

01:39.268 --> 01:43.973
-I'm telling you.
-Well that's fine.

01:44.707 --> 01:47.877
Sabrina would never do anything
like this to me.

01:48.845 --> 01:51.180
Well, you don't have to believe
it, I just wanted you to know.

01:51.180 --> 01:57.520
And I just want you to leave me
the -- alone! Alone!

01:58.955 --> 02:01.624
-I hear you.
-Good.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.028
Sabrina would never.

02:08.197 --> 02:14.036
Oh, I noticed you haven't called
anyone, why is that?

02:14.904 --> 02:19.242
-What?
-We know when you make a call.

02:19.575 --> 02:25.815
Leave me the -- alone!

02:27.817 --> 02:31.187
-Yeah?
-Okay, Maurice.

02:31.821 --> 02:33.523
You let me know when you're
ready Mr. Webb.

02:34.624 --> 02:37.927
Whatever, and don't call me back
in this bitch no more!

03:10.389 --> 03:12.759
[laughs]
And you weren't gonna tell me?

03:12.759 --> 03:15.161
Uh no, because I didn't want you
to tell Karen.

03:16.562 --> 03:18.030
I am not gonna tell Karen.

03:18.030 --> 03:21.567
Mhmmm, yeah, especially if you

Uh-huh, she gonna take that

03:38.751 --> 03:40.620
Okay, I'm confused.

03:41.621 --> 03:43.623
Just someone
I knew he'd fall for.

03:44.924 --> 03:50.696
Fatima, you're like this much
scary to me, very scary to me.

03:51.030 --> 03:52.198
I am not scary.

03:52.865 --> 03:55.168
Look Andi, if you don't mess
with me, I don't mess with you.

03:55.168 --> 03:58.671
-You have to stop this.
-Mhmmm, as soon as he does.

04:00.773 --> 04:03.709
Okay well I mean,
how do you know her,

04:03.709 --> 04:05.511
is she from your cousin?

04:05.511 --> 04:08.047
Mhmmm, yeah, just someone I knew
he'd fall for

04:08.047 --> 04:09.849
and he is not
gonna know what hit him.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.886
Okay by hit him,
he will remain alive?

04:17.223 --> 04:18.591
-Fatima!
-What'd you say?

04:18.591 --> 04:20.159
Will he remain alive?

04:23.529 --> 04:26.432
-Yes, he's gonna live girl.
-Oh, my gosh.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.334
He'll live,
I gotta go, I gotta go.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.136
Oh, um, no you don't.

04:31.838 --> 04:33.906

marry him or not?

-Look Andi, I love Zac, I do.
-I know you do.

-Mhmmm, and I know he loves me.

04:49.555 --> 04:53.192
-He makes that clear every day.
-Yeah.

04:54.393 --> 04:56.896
But I'm not with this Karen and
this might be his baby stuff.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.936
-It's something like, it's a--
-Why'd you say it like that?

05:03.936 --> 05:05.071
Season change like pollen.

05:05.438 --> 05:06.339
[Fatima]
<i>Why'd you say it like that?</i>

05:06.339 --> 05:07.273
Like what?

05:08.774 --> 05:09.842
-[Andi]<i> What are you talking--
</i>-Andi you do not have

05:09.842 --> 05:12.078
-a poker face.
-What?

05:13.312 --> 05:14.280
What do you know?

05:15.815 --> 05:17.316
I know that Zac loves you.

05:17.316 --> 05:20.920
No, that's not what I'm talking
about, we both know that.

05:21.721 --> 05:23.422
-Fatima.
-[Fatima]<i> What is it?</i>

05:23.422 --> 05:24.557
What do you know?

05:26.893 --> 05:31.364
Oh, it's cool.
Keep that little secret.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.565
It'll surface.

05:33.532 --> 05:34.500
You're keeping a secret

05:35.034 --> 05:37.236
and that is if you're gonna
marry this man or not.

05:37.703 --> 05:38.838
[Andi]<i> What's it gonna be?</i>

05:40.539 --> 05:41.874
Look, I just gotta see

05:41.874 --> 05:44.810
how he handles Karen
and if this is his baby.

05:50.616 --> 05:51.851
You just did it again.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.154
I have no clue what you're
talking about.

05:57.123 --> 05:58.858
Andi, you don't even know how to
lie.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.694
-Taking deep breaths.
-How are you a lawyer?

06:01.694 --> 06:03.162
I've been told that before.

06:03.763 --> 06:06.532
-[laughs]
-Um, yeah.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.768
Look, I'm telling you I just,
I gotta wait

06:08.768 --> 06:10.870
and see what happens with this
child support

06:10.870 --> 06:12.405
before me and Zac get married.

06:13.172 --> 06:15.474
Well, I mean, he's financially
stable now

06:15.474 --> 06:16.609
so he can handle that.

06:16.943 --> 06:19.178
Yeah, that both his baby mamas
know about.

06:19.178 --> 06:21.347
And Hayden is representing one
of them.

06:21.647 --> 06:22.648
-What?
-[Fatima]<i> Yes.</i>

06:23.115 --> 06:24.784
Girl, he found out
some kinda way

06:24.784 --> 06:27.086
and now he's repping her
and served Zac.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.756
Oh, Fatima, I don't know, uh-uh.

06:30.756 --> 06:34.327
Yeah, so, I'm gonna stick beside
him, I am, but

06:34.794 --> 06:36.996
I just gotta see what all this
boils down to first.

06:38.197 --> 06:40.633
-I understand that.
-[Fatima]<i> You do?</i>

06:40.633 --> 06:42.234
-Yeah.
-Great, so I can go now.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.371
Glad we got that cleared up.
I'm gonna go.

06:45.371 --> 06:46.639
-Okay.
-Alright.

06:46.639 --> 06:47.740
I'm gonna be right behind you

06:47.740 --> 06:49.342
'cause the girls are coming over
tonight.

06:50.676 --> 06:54.280
-Oh, okay.
-Um, excuse me.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.148
-Hmm?
-Now what was that look?

06:57.049 --> 06:58.818
I mean when y'all get together

06:58.818 --> 07:00.252
it's either a party or some
drama

07:00.252 --> 07:02.688
and considering that Karen
is pregnant,

07:02.688 --> 07:05.091
I'm sure it's not a party, so...

07:05.391 --> 07:06.559
[Fatima]<i> Y'all have fun.</i>

07:06.559 --> 07:08.127
On that note,
I will see you tomorrow.

07:08.127 --> 07:10.096
-Yes, I will see you later.
-[Andi]<i> Okay.</i>

07:11.297 --> 07:14.133
-Get out of those shoes.

07:35.554 --> 07:36.689
Okay but
I'm not gonna let you walk.

07:36.689 --> 07:38.357
You all beat up,

07:40.259 --> 07:42.061
And I would beat his ass again,
come on.

07:42.061 --> 07:46.165
-You know what?
-Come on, come buy me a drink.

07:47.500 --> 07:51.504
Oh no, no, no, no,
I don't, I don't buy drinks.

07:52.104 --> 07:54.440
Okay well
I can buy you some drinks.

07:55.041 --> 07:57.410
-Now that's a possibility.
-[Que] Hmm, tonight?

07:57.777 --> 07:59.378
No, not tonight.

08:00.646 --> 08:03.449
I know you have a pen, so can I
have a hit of it for this pain?

08:03.983 --> 08:06.419
You just gonna do it here at the
airport, you don't care?

08:06.419 --> 08:09.155
No. Well you do it.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.458
-I don't have a pen.
-Danni.

08:14.393 --> 08:18.998

-Yeah, I was waiting for you.

08:31.911 --> 08:34.313

Okay well, there's a bar close

08:40.586 --> 08:43.956
-Okay, I said a hit of this pen.
-No, you want this drink.

08:44.590 --> 08:47.760
-Who do you think you are?
-I can be pretty convincing.

08:48.594 --> 08:52.064
-Oh, oh see, no I--
-[Que] No, I'm telling you.

08:52.064 --> 08:56.068
-I, no I can shut a fool down.
-Nah.

08:57.803 --> 08:59.071
Even one that's been injured?

08:59.071 --> 09:01.807
Oh wow that's--
you're gonna use that?

09:01.807 --> 09:03.042
Yeah, whatever works.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.311
That's pathetic and it's not
working.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.513

-Did Sabrina give me up?

she and Que were working
together to get me locked up.

this shit up?

23:56.669 --> 23:59.204
-Andi.
-Yes, I'm on my way, bye.

24:00.305 --> 24:03.308
Alright, I'll see you

24:15.621 --> 24:17.489
-See?
-Just chill out.

24:17.489 --> 24:20.259
I told-- Now I'm back in the
sister circle with you.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.494
I'm tired of being in the sister
circle.

24:22.494 --> 24:23.429
Will you chill?

24:24.129 --> 24:24.963
We need to clean this up before
they get here, come on.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.131
I ain't cleaning up nothing.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.536
Alright well come on,
let's eat before they get here.

24:30.536 --> 24:31.437
Not even hungry.

24:32.571 --> 24:36.141
Well if you don't eat that,
you ain't getting nothing else.

24:37.910 --> 24:40.012
Let's eat, I'm just hungry right
now, that's all it is.

24:40.446 --> 24:42.347
Let's go and I'm gonna drink
this wine too.

24:47.119 --> 24:50.255
Women? I don't-- Somewhere
between the fight, I don't know.

24:50.255 --> 24:51.223
It was crazy.

24:51.957 --> 24:53.092
-Really?
-Yeah.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.060
-That's crazy.
-[Que] Yeah, it is.

24:55.794 --> 24:59.031
Alright, I can do like one more
of these and then I gotta go.

24:59.031 --> 25:00.733
-What?
-[Danni]<i> Yeah.</i>

25:00.733 --> 25:01.767
But I talked you into
coming here,

25:01.767 --> 25:02.801
least you can do is hang out.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.037
Yeah, I gotta go
see my friends, so--

25:05.037 --> 25:07.039
[Que] Friends? Can I come?

25:07.773 --> 25:10.342
No, I don't know you.

25:11.310 --> 25:12.211
Well, I'm just saying.

25:13.178 --> 25:15.614
And you have a ankle monitor
on your leg.

25:16.448 --> 25:19.118
Come on, have some sympathy on a
man that was beat up on.

25:19.118 --> 25:23.122
You know see that's the thing,
I'm not sure I believe that.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.024
Danni, I'm telling you the
truth, why would I lie?

25:26.024 --> 25:30.229
I don't know, but that thing is
telling me a lot about you.

25:31.797 --> 25:34.399
-So you one of them.
-One of who?

25:34.700 --> 25:35.634
One of those women that think

25:35.934 --> 25:37.503
all black men
are all really criminals.

25:39.171 --> 25:42.808
-Excuse-- No, farthest from it.
-[Que] Mhmmm.

25:42.808 --> 25:44.977
I know how -- up this
justice system is.

25:44.977 --> 25:46.345
Okay, thank you.

25:46.879 --> 25:49.014
I also know how slick you think
you are.

25:49.815 --> 25:52.417
-I'm not.
-Mm, mhmmm.

25:52.417 --> 25:55.387
So why you want me so bad, why
you pushing up on me so hard?

25:56.822 --> 25:58.724
-Just being nice.
-[Danni]<i> Just being nice?</i>

25:58.724 --> 25:59.992
Just being nice.

26:01.293 --> 26:05.931
Okay well I gotta go, got some
people to meet, so...

26:05.931 --> 26:09.635
Okay well if I can't come over
to the house--

26:09.635 --> 26:10.903
-No, you can't.
-[laughs]

26:11.770 --> 26:15.040
-You sure?
-Yeah, I learned my lesson.

26:16.008 --> 26:16.975
And what is that?

26:16.975 --> 26:18.610
Some of y'all are batshit crazy.

26:18.610 --> 26:19.578
[Que] Hmm.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.515
-Not me.
-Oh, you're not?

26:23.515 --> 26:24.449
[Que] Mm-mm.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.485
Well in that case, I mean you
should've said that,

26:26.485 --> 26:27.452
it's still a no.

26:29.354 --> 26:32.925
Okay well you got my number.
You know who to call.

26:33.959 --> 26:35.994
You know I wouldn't count on it.

26:36.862 --> 26:38.263
I'm definitely counting on it.

26:39.264 --> 26:42.100
Alright well you keep counting,
but I'm gonna...

26:43.068 --> 26:45.571
maybe count to,
I don't know, a thousand?

26:45.571 --> 26:46.738
-A thousand?
-Yeah.

26:46.738 --> 26:49.374
-Okay.
-But like times a million.

26:49.374 --> 26:54.146
-Times-- I'm terrible at math.
-So once you figure that out--

26:54.746 --> 26:58.217
Sir, I'm sorry, 'scuse me, y'all
a beautiful couple, baby I'm

26:58.217 --> 26:59.985

-Oh, sorry.

26:59.985 --> 27:00.919
I appreciate that.

27:01.687 --> 27:05.257
After you do that math, maybe
you can expect my call, okay?

27:05.691 --> 27:08.360
Alright Quincy,
don't get into any more trouble.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.629
I'll try not to get into
any more trouble.

27:17.269 --> 27:20.472
-Okay, I get it.
-Thank you so much.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.473
Of course.

27:22.507 --> 27:26.078
Wow, look at the time,
everyone's gone and...

27:27.112 --> 27:29.081
It's fine, trust me.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.850
I've kept you here this whole
time with all my drama.

27:31.850 --> 27:32.851
I don't mind.

27:33.418 --> 27:36.421
I know you don't 'cause you're
a sweet man.

27:36.421 --> 27:37.489
Thank you.

27:38.357 --> 27:41.293
-I know this is outta line.
-What?

27:43.729 --> 27:44.997
Are you single?

27:47.232 --> 27:51.737
-Well, you know.
-No, you're married.

27:52.404 --> 27:56.041
Of course, a handsome successful
man like you has to be married.

27:56.341 --> 28:00.445
No, I am definitely single.
-What?

28:00.746 --> 28:03.916
-Oh yeah.
-Wow.

28:05.250 --> 28:08.387
But why? Someone should've
snatched you up already.

28:08.820 --> 28:11.690
You know, I'm just taking my
time.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.027
-I see.
-Yeah.

28:17.462 --> 28:18.764
Well, I should go.

-I really appreciate you.
-Oh my.

28:29.041 --> 28:33.011
-What, what's wrong?
-I'm so embarassed.

28:34.112 --> 28:37.115
-Why are you embarassed?
-You're hard.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.818
Nah, I'm not.

28:39.818 --> 28:42.654
-Yeah, you are.
-Nah, I'm just--

28:42.654 --> 28:44.156

-[Tamara]<i> Yeah.</i>

28:46.258 --> 28:48.126
That's all natural,
I'm just gifted, baby.

28:49.361 --> 28:53.498
Oh.
Well, I wish you were.

28:54.566 --> 28:55.500
What's that?

28:56.868 --> 29:00.806
I just think you're so sexy,
and...

29:01.540 --> 29:05.043
-I'm so sexy and what?
-Nothing.

29:05.544 --> 29:08.347
-I really should go.
-No you really should tell me.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.649
-I'm sorry, no I, I need to go.
-Okay.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.656
If you're free, do you wanna
get a drink with me?

29:18.123 --> 29:20.792
-Oh, absolutely.
-Okay.

29:20.792 --> 29:23.095
Okay, I'll drive.

29:38.643 --> 29:39.678
Sounds good to me.

29:43.482 --> 29:46.051
If you could come now, that
would be great.

29:46.051 --> 29:47.486
Oh, I'm right there with you.

29:49.521 --> 29:53.058
You know what?
Let me walk you to your car.

29:53.759 --> 29:56.028
-Okay.
-Let's go.

29:56.028 --> 29:57.162
-Okay.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.100
After you.

30:15.380 --> 30:18.116
-Hey.
-Left the door unlocked.

30:19.518 --> 30:20.452
How was work?

30:21.386 --> 30:24.890
So good, honestly I think I
turned over a new leaf.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.393
-It was work, Preston.
-Oh but that's good.

30:29.261 --> 30:32.297
-What'd you do all day?
-I just thought about you.

30:33.432 --> 30:36.501
-You sure?
-As true as I'm sitting here.

30:38.470 --> 30:40.405
You didn't think about that
girl?

30:41.473 --> 30:42.441
What girl?

30:43.708 --> 30:44.709
You know, the one you were

30:44.709 --> 30:46.144
talking about marrying,
that girl.

30:46.978 --> 30:49.815
You know that's kinda why I was
thinking about you.

30:50.415 --> 30:53.585
Right, okay well, I need to
shower and get ready.

30:53.585 --> 30:54.753
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.556
I was kinda hoping
I could talk to you.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.460
Well I was gonna go,
I'm hanging out with the girls.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.762
Don't, don't you go
trying to avoid me.

31:03.762 --> 31:04.696
I'm not.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.766
So could you sit for a minute?

31:08.900 --> 31:13.271
-I don't have much time, so...
-See? Trying to avoid me.

31:13.271 --> 31:18.643
-I'm not-- Okay.
-Just talk for a minute.

31:18.643 --> 31:19.811
Okay, okay.

31:20.579 --> 31:24.683
So you wanna tell me what
happened?

31:25.817 --> 31:27.319
Whatever do you mean?

31:27.319 --> 31:29.554
Whatever--
Your neighbor.

31:30.422 --> 31:35.760
-Yeah, the landlord?
-She was asking about you.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.429
What did she say?

31:38.897 --> 31:40.465
She was asking if you were okay

31:40.465 --> 31:43.602
and she said that you hit
someone with your car.

31:49.474 --> 31:52.577
-Mhmmm, mhmmm.
-What happened?

31:53.011 --> 31:58.150
-It's not a big deal.
-Danni, you ran someone over.

31:58.817 --> 32:00.152
That's a big deal.

32:01.119 --> 32:03.188
Well I don't wanna
talk about it.

32:06.124 --> 32:08.460
-You sure?
-I don't.

32:10.929 --> 32:16.468
Fine, but whatever it is, you
know I'm here for you, right?

32:17.102 --> 32:19.538
Yeah, mhmmm.

32:23.208 --> 32:26.511
But she also said

32:29.414 --> 32:31.583
she saw someone hit you.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.687
Old bitch is listening through
my walls.

32:38.156 --> 32:40.458
So someone did hit you?

32:42.227 --> 32:44.863
There's no way
she could've seen that.

32:45.931 --> 32:47.465
Then why would she say that?

32:48.700 --> 32:51.870
Listen Preston, I just wanna go
hang out with my girls.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.605
I really don't want
any drama tonight.

32:53.605 --> 32:57.676
Danni, you-- You just said that
she heard it.

32:58.109 --> 32:59.678
You said that, right?

33:00.779 --> 33:01.780
Preston.

33:04.482 --> 33:07.219
-You don't wanna tell me.
-I don't.

33:08.753 --> 33:09.721
Danni.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.257
Preston I will talk to you
about it,

33:12.257 --> 33:14.259
I just don't wanna
talk about it right now.

33:15.560 --> 33:19.297
-Okay, fine.
-Alright so thank you

33:19.297 --> 33:23.501
for respecting that and not
asking me any more.

33:24.603 --> 33:28.506
-See here's the thing.
-Thank you for respecting that.

33:28.506 --> 33:31.076
I, I don't, I don't respect that
and I don't respect that.

33:31.076 --> 33:33.345
-[Danni] And not asking me any--
-And I'm gonna ask you some more

33:37.782 --> 33:38.717
But later.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.587
Alright, you go on and be with
the girls.

33:43.989 --> 33:46.258
-I'll be here.
-Thank you.

33:47.425 --> 33:48.827
Am I dismissed?

33:51.329 --> 33:55.500
But we will talk when you get
back.

34:01.399 --> 34:02.433
[knocking]

34:03.734 --> 34:04.668
Coming.

34:08.839 --> 34:11.675
-Who is it?
-[Calvin] It's me, Calvin.

34:14.645 --> 34:16.046
-Hey.
-[Sabrina] Hey.

34:16.547 --> 34:18.883
I was just coming by to see if
you were okay.

34:20.718 --> 34:21.652
I'm fine.

34:25.022 --> 34:27.658
-You sure?
-Yeah.

34:30.494 --> 34:33.764
-I'm fine.
-So I got a call.

34:34.198 --> 34:35.666
-From Maurice?
-Yeah.

34:35.666 --> 34:36.801
[Sabrina]<i> What'd he say?</i>

34:37.668 --> 34:40.037
He said the prosecutor told him
that you gave him up.

34:42.440 --> 34:44.341
That lying son of a bitch.

34:44.341 --> 34:46.110
I know, I told him that.

34:46.944 --> 34:52.483
-You-- He believed you, right?
-I hope so.

34:54.051 --> 35:00.024
-Oh, my God. He better.
-That's not the worst part.

35:01.325 --> 35:02.927
They want him to give you up.

35:04.895 --> 35:07.565
-All because of--
-That punk ass -- Que.

35:12.002 --> 35:15.639
-He makes me so angry.
-Shoulda let me kill his ass.

35:17.074 --> 35:21.111
-You would've been in jail.
-Yeah, I know.

35:23.581 --> 35:26.851
-I hate that.
-Me too.

35:27.384 --> 35:29.320
Well, I'm gonna try to see Andi
tonight

35:29.320 --> 35:31.722
and see if she can do
something for him.

35:32.356 --> 35:35.726
Good, good, good. [sighs]

35:36.861 --> 35:39.497
I hope he knows that I would
never do something like that.

35:39.997 --> 35:43.067
-He does.
-You sure?

35:43.434 --> 35:46.971
Yeah, but I'd still
talk to Andi.

35:47.872 --> 35:50.541
-So you're not sure.
-No, I am, I am, I really am.

35:53.644 --> 35:55.112
But I'd talk to her quick.

35:56.847 --> 35:58.749
-He's gonna give me up.
-No he's not.

35:59.416 --> 36:01.652
-How can you be so sure?
-He's not.

36:02.820 --> 36:04.622
Do you think
they're gonna let him out?

36:05.222 --> 36:06.924
So they can come get me?

36:07.691 --> 36:11.795
-That's what they said.
-Oh, my God.

36:13.931 --> 36:16.534
-He better not do that.
-He won't.

36:17.368 --> 36:19.103
[knocking]

36:20.170 --> 36:21.539
Come in.

36:26.410 --> 36:28.612
-Sabrina.
-Hi.

36:29.246 --> 36:30.180
Bayo.

36:30.948 --> 36:33.584
I'm sorry for dropping by like
this but

36:33.584 --> 36:37.154
I've been calling and
calling and I was so worried.

36:37.154 --> 36:38.322
I've come by three times.

36:38.722 --> 36:40.791
I'm sorry,
I just needed some time.

36:41.992 --> 36:44.929
Oh, well that's not good I was
hoping that we--

36:44.929 --> 36:45.863
Hello.

36:46.764 --> 36:50.801
-Oh, you have company.
-Yes.

36:52.036 --> 36:55.072
-You don't see me sitting here?
-I do now.

36:55.940 --> 36:58.175
[Sabrina]
<i>I'm going to call you later.</i>

36:58.542 --> 37:00.210
-Will you?
-[Sabrina] Yes, I will.

37:00.744 --> 37:02.379
Okay, thank you for
checking on me.

37:02.947 --> 37:04.949
-Okay, bye.
-[Sabrina]<i> Bye.</i>

37:04.949 --> 37:05.883
Bye-bye.

37:13.924 --> 37:15.960
Hey look, I was just coming by
to tell you that.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.762
Guess you can call him back
if you want.

37:18.762 --> 37:24.535
No, I'm not.
And listen, don't do that.

37:24.535 --> 37:27.471
Okay, I just don't want any
stress right now.

37:27.471 --> 37:29.039
I'm not, I'm not saying
anything.

37:30.874 --> 37:33.510
I have to change, I have hair
all over this dress.

37:34.411 --> 37:39.183
If you wanna stay and talk for a
little bit, I would like that.

37:39.183 --> 37:40.651
But please no drama.

37:42.820 --> 37:45.823
-Yeah, I'll stay and talk.
-Okay.

37:52.229 --> 37:53.764
[phone buzzing]

37:55.199 --> 37:57.034
-Hello?
-[Tamara]<i> Hey.</i>

37:57.568 --> 37:59.403
-Who is this?
-[Tamara]<i> Tamara.</i>

37:59.803 --> 38:02.406
-Oh, how'd it go?
-[Tamara]<i> I got this --</i>

38:02.406 --> 38:04.308
<i>eating out the palm of my hand.</i>

38:04.575 --> 38:05.709
That's great.

38:05.709 --> 38:07.778
[Tamara]
<i>Yeah, he's taking me to dinner.</i>

38:07.978 --> 38:09.146
Okay, good.

38:09.146 --> 38:11.248
[Tamara]<i> Then I'm taking him to
the hotel.</i>

38:11.949 --> 38:13.584
-Alright.
-[Tamara]<i> I promise you</i>

38:13.984 --> 38:16.654
<i>I will have him
doing whatever I say in a week.</i>

38:17.087 --> 38:18.822
Look, I don't need all the
details.

38:18.822 --> 38:20.791
[Tamara]<i> Okay well,
what do you want?</i>

38:21.492 --> 38:23.894
Look, I just thought if he had
somebody,

38:23.894 --> 38:26.330
he would leave me and
my situation alone.

38:26.864 --> 38:28.999
-[Tamara]<i> I got it.
</i>-Alright.

38:28.999 --> 38:31.068
[Tamara]<i> His mind will be on
nothing but me.</i>

38:31.802 --> 38:33.003
Alright, that's good.

38:33.003 --> 38:34.471
[Tamara] I'll let you know how
things go.

38:35.239 --> 38:37.941
-Alright, you do that.
-[Tamara]<i> Okay, thanks.</i>

38:37.941 --> 38:38.942
Mhmmm, bye.

38:57.661 --> 38:59.663
-Andi what, what--
-I got here as soon as I could.

39:02.032 --> 39:03.867
Okay but you didn't have to
come.

39:04.535 --> 39:08.205
-I absolutely had to come.
-Why?

39:09.773 --> 39:11.842
I wanna know why they invited
you here.

39:12.509 --> 39:17.981
-I don't know.
-Okay, okay.

39:17.981 --> 39:19.850
Wait Andi, did you tell her?

39:20.751 --> 39:22.553
-No.
-Did you tell her?

39:22.553 --> 39:24.288
Of course I didn't, I swear.

39:25.422 --> 39:27.624
-Okay.
-[Andi] Okay.

39:28.659 --> 39:31.862
-This is a bit strange, right?
-Yeah, it is.

39:32.262 --> 39:33.263
[Andi] Yeah.

39:36.300 --> 39:38.836
Are you gonna tell her?

39:39.470 --> 39:42.039
I think they should both know.

39:42.039 --> 39:44.174
Okay, okay.

39:44.875 --> 39:46.910
Andi why, why are you nervous?

39:47.845 --> 39:50.314
I'm not nervous,
I just, you know,

39:50.314 --> 39:56.186
I want both of you to be
happy and cool and level-headed.

39:56.820 --> 40:00.457
-You know?
-Okay well...

40:00.457 --> 40:03.694
I'm good, so...
-Good.

40:05.095 --> 40:07.731
Did you wanna maybe leave your
purse in the car?

40:08.665 --> 40:10.734
Why would I do that?
This might be a set up.

40:12.703 --> 40:13.971
I don't think you'll need your
purse for--

40:13.971 --> 40:17.608
I think I will, friend,
thank you, let's go.

40:17.608 --> 40:19.109
-Okay.
-[Karen]<i> Yeah.</i>

40:25.783 --> 40:28.585
-You ready?
-I am.

40:28.886 --> 40:31.655
-You ready?
-Yeah.

40:33.624 --> 40:38.061
[knocking]
Alright, open the door.

40:41.331 --> 40:42.266
Got this.

40:49.673 --> 40:54.411
Hey, come on in, have a seat.

41:08.425 --> 41:09.359
Thank you.

41:17.968 --> 41:20.270
So are you guys ready to talk?

41:27.854 --> 41:31.491
That desk pisses me off,
all these pictures of y'all--

41:34.160 --> 41:37.030
-Did you know they were engaged?
-Yes.

41:37.030 --> 41:38.932
You knew this the whole time!

41:38.932 --> 41:42.535
I wanted to stop by and say
thank you.

41:42.535 --> 41:45.104
-What'd I do?
-Consistent.

41:45.104 --> 41:46.573
I don't know how else to say
I'm sorry.

41:46.839 --> 41:47.807
Hmmm.

41:48.541 --> 41:50.443
I don't know, maybe you could
try by doing the right thing.

41:52.478 --> 41:53.479
What the--

41:53.780 --> 41:56.082
Yeah, that -- coming after
you hard.

42:26.944 --> 42:30.681
