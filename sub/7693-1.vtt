WEBVTT

00:07.038 --> 00:08.379
TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT!

00:08.379 --> 00:10.541
THE NEW FROZEN YOGURT SHOP
IS OPENING!

00:10.541 --> 00:14.215
FIFTY-TWO FLAVORS
AND FOUR OF THEM
ARE SUGAR-FREE.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.547
OH, WHO ARE YOU KIDDING?

00:16.547 --> 00:19.019
YOU PASSED OUT THE FIRST TIME
YOU DISCOVERED NAIL POLISH.

00:20.751 --> 00:22.623
I'VE HEARD OF
THOSE YOGURT PLACES.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.595
THEY GET YOU BY
CHARGING EXTRA FOR TOPPINGS.

00:24.595 --> 00:27.058
SO, I'M BRINGING MY OWN.

00:30.101 --> 00:31.602
YOU DON'T EVEN WANNA KNOW
WHAT'S IN MY PANTS.

00:31.602 --> 00:35.366
AAH! OOH! HOT BUTTERSCOTCH! OOH!

00:37.568 --> 00:41.112
SORRY, YOU GUYS ARE COMING HOME
STRAIGHT AFTER SCHOOL.

00:41.112 --> 00:42.573
SO NO FLAVORS, NO FROYO,

00:42.573 --> 00:45.476
NO HANGING WITH THE BROS,
PEEPS, AND HOMIES.

00:45.476 --> 00:48.679
"BROS, PEEPS, AND HOMIES?"

00:49.750 --> 00:53.053
DON'T. JUST... NO.

00:55.626 --> 00:57.528
WHAT'S GOT YOU SO GROUCHY?

00:57.528 --> 01:00.561
THEY RUN OUT OF HUMAN FOOTSTOOLS
AT THE RICH-GUY CLUB?

01:00.561 --> 01:04.295
DID YOU FORGET
YOUR LITTLE BUDDY MARCUS
FOUND THE LAB YESTERDAY?

01:04.295 --> 01:06.767
HE COULD'VE DISCOVERED
OUR BIONIC SECRET.

01:06.767 --> 01:11.302
OH! OKAY, SO IT'S OUR FAULT
THAT YOUR MILLION-DOLLAR

01:11.302 --> 01:13.073
SMART HOME SYSTEM
DIDN'T STOP HIM?

01:13.073 --> 01:15.606
DON'T GO THERE, SUPERGIRL.

01:15.606 --> 01:17.478
I WAS GETTING MY BEAUTY SLEEP.

01:17.478 --> 01:20.611
SOMETHING YOU MIGHT
WANT TO LOOK INTO.

01:20.611 --> 01:22.753
HO-HO!
 OOH!

01:22.753 --> 01:25.756
LOOK, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHOSE FAULT IT WAS,

01:25.756 --> 01:29.320
EVEN THOUGH SOMEONE
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WATCHING HIM.

01:30.621 --> 01:33.624
WELL, TECHNICALLY
SOMEONE PULLED LEO AWAY,

01:33.624 --> 01:36.797
LETTING MARCUS ROAM FREE.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.400
GUYS, I THINK YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT EACH OTHER.

01:40.671 --> 01:44.635
BOTTOM LINE, I AM KEEPING
A TIGHTER LEASH ON YOU THREE.

01:44.635 --> 01:46.477
AND LEO, BECAUSE
I CAN'T ALWAYS BE THERE,

01:46.477 --> 01:48.309
YOU HAVE TO STEP IT UP
AND DO A BETTER JOB

01:48.309 --> 01:49.680
OF WATCHING OUT FOR THEM.

01:49.680 --> 01:50.641
NO PROBLEM, BIG "D."

01:50.641 --> 01:53.184
I MAY HAVE LET ONE GOON
GET TOO CLOSE,

01:53.184 --> 01:55.646
BUT I WON'T LET
ANY MORE MARCUSES
SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS.

01:55.646 --> 01:58.719
FROM NOW ON
YOU CAN CALL ME THE ENFORCER!

02:03.394 --> 02:06.457
LEO'S THE ENFORCER? ( scoffs )

02:06.457 --> 02:08.127
CAPTURING ADAM, BREE, AND CHASE

02:08.127 --> 02:10.631
IS GONNA BE EASIER
THAN I THOUGHT.

02:15.206 --> 02:18.169
NARRATOR:
 THE WORLD'S FIRST
BIONIC SUPERHUMANS.

02:18.169 --> 02:20.140
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,

02:20.140 --> 02:21.812
FASTER, SMARTER--

02:21.812 --> 02:24.345
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:24.345 --> 02:27.218
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

02:27.218 --> 02:30.181
♪♪

03:04.415 --> 03:07.488
THE HAMMER IS DOWN, PEOPLE.

03:07.488 --> 03:10.321
NO MORE TALKING TO BOYS,
NO MORE TALKING TO GIRLS,

03:10.321 --> 03:13.324
NO MORE HELPING OLD LADIES
TO THEIR CARS!

03:13.324 --> 03:15.596
I WAS HELPING YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

03:15.596 --> 03:18.198
TRUST NO ONE!

03:19.600 --> 03:21.272
IT'S HERE! IT'S HERE! IT'S HERE!

03:21.272 --> 03:22.873
IT'S HERE! IT'S HERE!

03:22.873 --> 03:25.236
IT'S HERE!

03:25.236 --> 03:26.777
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

03:26.777 --> 03:30.311
WHATEVER IT IS, I HOPE IT CAME
WITH A BIG BOX OF MASCULINITY,

03:30.311 --> 03:33.213
'CAUSE I NEVER
WANT TO SEE THAT AGAIN.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.415
JUST COME HERE!

03:34.415 --> 03:35.916
( all chuckle )

03:37.348 --> 03:39.219
( chuckles )

03:39.219 --> 03:43.624
MEET THE WORLD'S
FIRST SELF-DRIVING CAR,

03:43.624 --> 03:45.796
DESIGNED BY YOURS TRULY.

03:45.796 --> 03:47.298
THAT'S RIGHT,
JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT

03:47.298 --> 03:48.999
I COULDN'T GET MORE AWESOME,

03:48.999 --> 03:51.762
BOOM! I GOT MORE AWESOME!

03:51.762 --> 03:53.364
AND, BOOM!

03:53.364 --> 03:55.235
I STILL WANT TO BE DROPPED OFF
A BLOCK AWAY FROM SCHOOL.

03:56.267 --> 03:58.269
SO HOW DOES
THIS THING DRIVE ITSELF?

03:58.269 --> 03:59.770
OH, WELL, UH,
SEE THIS PANEL ON TOP?

03:59.770 --> 04:01.772
IT RECEIVES
A SATELLITE SIGNAL

04:01.772 --> 04:03.444
AND SENDS ALL
THE PERTINENT INFORMATION

04:03.444 --> 04:05.346
TO THE CAR'S
ON-BOARD COMPUTER

04:05.346 --> 04:08.349
AND VOILA,
IT DRIVES ITSELF!

04:08.349 --> 04:10.351
HEY, DID I MENTION,
BY THE WAY,

04:10.351 --> 04:14.525
THAT THIS CAR
GOES 200 MILES AN HOUR? NO?

04:14.525 --> 04:16.327
THAT'S BECAUSE IT GOES 300!

04:18.529 --> 04:20.531
( beeps, engine starts )

04:20.531 --> 04:22.393
GOOD EVENING, DONALD.

04:22.393 --> 04:24.295
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE A RIDE?

04:24.295 --> 04:26.266
SHE SOUNDS CLASSY.
 OH, YEAH.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.539
GUYS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:28.539 --> 04:32.543
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR SCHOOL!
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

04:32.543 --> 04:34.405
WHAT IS THIS?

04:34.405 --> 04:37.408
DONALD, IS THIS
MY ANNIVERSARY PRESENT?!

04:37.408 --> 04:40.311
( gasps ) THIS IS TOO MUCH!
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE!

04:40.311 --> 04:41.281
( chuckles ) I DIDN'T.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.485
UH, YOUR GIFT
IS A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.657
BUT, UH, JUST AS ROMANTIC.

04:46.657 --> 04:48.319
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

04:48.319 --> 04:51.792
TODAY IS THE FIVE YEAR
ANNIVERSARY OF MY ACTIVATION

04:51.792 --> 04:53.824
AND HE'S SPENDING IT WITH ME!

04:53.824 --> 04:57.398
OH, I'M SORRY, EDDY,
I COMPLETELY FORGOT.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.370
DONALD, IF YOU EVEN CONSIDER

04:59.370 --> 05:02.533
SPENDING OUR ANNIVERSARY
WITH THAT DERANGED EMOTICON,

05:02.533 --> 05:05.336
IT'S GONNA GET UGLY
AROUND HERE.

05:05.336 --> 05:07.077
WELL, IF ANYONE KNOWS UGLY--

05:07.077 --> 05:08.639
EDDY!

05:08.639 --> 05:12.343
DON'T WORRY, HONEY,
THIS NIGHT IS ALL ABOUT YOU.

05:12.343 --> 05:17.317
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I HAVE PREPARED A SPECIAL
ANNIVERSARY DINNER MYSELF.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.089
THANK YOU!
 THANK YOU!

05:19.089 --> 05:21.552
I WAS TALKING TO MY WIFE.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.998
BECKY, LOVING THE NEW TEE!

05:29.430 --> 05:31.902
SORRY, BECKY,
ADAM CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW.

05:31.902 --> 05:33.404
HE HAS A HORRIBLE DISEASE.

05:33.404 --> 05:36.367
YOU'D BETTER JET BEFORE
HIS FLESH STARTS EATING ITSELF.

05:38.439 --> 05:42.773
LEO, YOU ARE TAKING THIS
"ENFORCER" THING WAY TOO FAR.

05:42.773 --> 05:44.775
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

05:44.775 --> 05:46.777
HEY.

05:46.777 --> 05:49.450
( beeping )

05:49.450 --> 05:51.422
YOU'RE GOOD.

05:54.555 --> 05:55.956
HEY GUYS! WHAT'S UP?

05:55.956 --> 05:57.628
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S UP,
YOUR TIME HERE.

05:57.628 --> 05:59.430
GET LOST, CREEPY.
 ( beeps )

05:59.430 --> 06:02.393
SILLY, LEO.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.837
SO, GUYS, ARE YOU EXCITED
FOR THE NEW FROZEN YOGURT SHOP?

06:06.837 --> 06:08.669
THEY'RE GIVING OUT
UNLIMITED TOPPINGS.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.572
PRINCIPAL PERRY'S
BEEN CAMPED OUT FOR A WEEK.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.574
WHA-- UNLIMITED TOPPINGS?

06:13.574 --> 06:18.449
SOMEBODY COULD'VE TOLD ME THAT
BEFORE I FILLED MY SOCKS UP
WITH GUMMY FROGS.

06:18.449 --> 06:21.151
STRANGER DANGER.

06:21.151 --> 06:24.154
UH, SORRY, MARCUS,
WE CAN'T GO.

06:24.154 --> 06:26.617
UH, WE HAVE CHORES TO DO.

06:26.617 --> 06:28.489
NO WE DON'T.
WE HAVE AN UPTIGHT DAD

06:28.489 --> 06:31.462
WHO'S AFRAID
WE'LL REVEAL OUR SECRET--

06:31.462 --> 06:33.464
RECIPE FOR CHILI.

06:33.464 --> 06:34.425
OOH, THAT WORKS. LET'S GO!

06:34.425 --> 06:36.497
WHOO!
 YEAH!

06:39.630 --> 06:43.434
UGH, EVERYBODY FROM SCHOOL IS
CHECKING IN AT THE YOGURT SHOP!

06:43.434 --> 06:46.777
EVEN SUSIE REYNOLDS,
AND SHE'S LACTOSE INTOLERANT.

06:48.178 --> 06:49.840
GUYS, I NEED YOUR HELP

06:49.840 --> 06:52.182
TO MAKE TASHA'S DINNER TONIGHT
EXTRA-SPECIAL.

06:52.182 --> 06:54.014
YEAH, SURE. WHAT CAN WE DO?

06:54.014 --> 06:58.449
STAY FAR, FAR AWAY.

07:00.951 --> 07:04.154
( phone beeps )

07:04.154 --> 07:05.896
( sighs )
I KNEW WE SHOULD HAVE GONE

07:05.896 --> 07:07.427
TO THE GRAND OPENING
WITH MARCUS!

07:07.427 --> 07:09.429
HE JUST TEXTED ME
AND SAID THAT PRINCIPAL PERRY

07:09.429 --> 07:13.063
IS SHOTGUNNING TUTTI-FRUITY
STRAIGHT FROM THE DISPENSER!

07:13.063 --> 07:16.567
WE ARE MISSING THE BIGGEST
SOCIAL EVENT OF THE YEAR.

07:16.567 --> 07:17.908
LET'S JUST GO!

07:17.908 --> 07:20.811
WE CAN'T.
MR. DAVENPORT WANTS US HERE.

07:20.811 --> 07:23.914
NO, MR. DAVENPORT
WANTS US FAR, FAR AWAY.

07:23.914 --> 07:27.618
AND THE YOGURT SHOP
IS FAR, FAR AWAY.

07:27.618 --> 07:31.451
YOUR RAZOR-THIN LOGIC
WORKS FOR ME!

07:31.451 --> 07:34.585
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
WHAT ABOUT LEO?

07:34.585 --> 07:36.587
MARCUS SAID NOT TO INVITE HIM
AND HE'S RIGHT.

07:36.587 --> 07:38.028
WE JUST HAVE TO BE QUICK.

07:38.028 --> 07:40.561
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS QUICK?
DAVENPORT'S CAR.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.832
ARE YOU CRAZY?

07:41.832 --> 07:44.094
MR. DAVENPORT WOULD KILL US
IF HE KNEW WE DROVE HIS CAR.

07:44.094 --> 07:47.097
YES, BUT WE WOULDN'T BE
DRIVING HIS CAR,

07:47.097 --> 07:49.239
IT DRIVES ITSELF.

07:49.239 --> 07:51.702
BOOM!
 CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT!

07:56.547 --> 07:59.179
HONEY,
BEFORE OUR DINNER TONIGHT,

07:59.179 --> 08:01.752
I HAVE
A SPECIAL TREAT FOR YOU.

08:01.752 --> 08:06.557
IT'S A SLIDE SHOW
OF OUR FIRST YEAR TOGETHER.

08:06.557 --> 08:08.018
SHOWTIME, EDDY!

08:08.018 --> 08:10.561
OKAY, HERE YOU ARE
AFTER YOUR WEDDING.

08:10.561 --> 08:12.763
AW, SUCH A SPECIAL DAY.

08:12.763 --> 08:16.527
NOT FOR ME. I WAS HOME ALONE
TALKING TO THE LAMP.

08:17.668 --> 08:21.602
OOH, THIS PICTURE'S
EVEN BETTER.

08:21.602 --> 08:24.575
EDDY, YOU TOOK
MY FACE OFF THE PICTURE!

08:24.575 --> 08:26.006
FINE, I'LL PUT IT BACK!

08:28.208 --> 08:30.510
EDDY!

08:30.510 --> 08:34.585
HEY, JUST BE GLAD I DIDN'T
PUT IT ON THE OTHER END.

08:34.585 --> 08:35.546
OOH,
HERE'S MY PERSONAL FAVORITE,

08:35.546 --> 08:38.048
TASHA WAKING UP IN THE MORNING.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.852
IGNORE HIM, IGNORE HIM.

08:41.852 --> 08:43.193
LET'S JUST
HAVE SOME DINNER.

08:43.193 --> 08:45.856
LET'S JUST...
( chuckles ) YEAH.

08:45.856 --> 08:48.228
NICE ANNIVERSARY DINNER.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.861
OH, BE RIGHT BACK IN A SECOND.

08:50.861 --> 08:53.303
DONALD, I'M A LITTLE WARM.
CAN YOU COOL IT OFF?

08:53.303 --> 08:54.605
I'M ON IT!

08:59.009 --> 09:02.242
AAH! EDDY, WHAT DID YOU DO?

09:02.242 --> 09:04.314
( chuckles )
I FROZE THE TURKEY!

09:10.681 --> 09:12.583
THIS THING IS AWESOME!

09:12.583 --> 09:14.254
YEAH, YOU JUST SAY
ANY DESTINATION

09:14.254 --> 09:16.086
AND IT AUTOMATICALLY
TAKES YOU THERE.

09:16.086 --> 09:17.758
YET NO MATTER
HOW MANY TIMES I TELL IT,

09:17.758 --> 09:20.961
"TAKE ME TO A BETTER LIFE,"
HERE I AM.

09:22.092 --> 09:23.133
AND GET THIS,

09:23.133 --> 09:26.867
IT EVEN HAS A COMPARTMENT
FOR YOUR GLOVES!

09:26.867 --> 09:30.100
SO, GUYS, THE LINE
LOOKS PRETTY LONG.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.903
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST CRUISE
THIS THING OVER TO MY HOUSE.

09:32.903 --> 09:36.947
HOLD IT! ( panting )

09:41.281 --> 09:43.113
EDDY TOLD ME YOU GUYS SNUCK OUT.

09:43.113 --> 09:44.615
YOU'RE ALL COMING WITH ME!

09:44.615 --> 09:45.656
NO, WE'RE NOT.

09:45.656 --> 09:46.917
OH, YES, YOU ARE!

09:46.917 --> 09:48.088
YOU CAN'T TELL US
WHAT TO DO.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.259
YEAH, YOU'RE NOT
THE BOSS OF US.

09:49.259 --> 09:50.590
WHAT, DID YOU
RUN OVER HERE?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.663
YES, BECAUSE...

09:52.663 --> 09:55.896
( all arguing )

10:00.270 --> 10:01.601
( beeps )

10:01.601 --> 10:04.174
PLEASE ENTER A DESTINATION.

10:04.174 --> 10:09.680
BOTTOM OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN
AND OVERRIDE MANUAL BRAKING.

10:09.680 --> 10:13.784
I'M SORRY, MANUAL BRAKING
CANNOT BE OVERRIDDEN.

10:13.784 --> 10:15.145
( beeps )

10:15.145 --> 10:17.688
MANUAL BRAKING OVERRIDDEN.

10:17.688 --> 10:19.189
DESTINATION ACCEPTED.

10:19.189 --> 10:23.123
WAITING FOR DOOR TO CLOSE.

10:25.996 --> 10:29.029
GOOD THING I SPRUNG FOR
THE UNDERWATER CAMERA.

10:30.801 --> 10:32.703
ALL OF YOU ARE GETTING IN
THE CAR, RIGHT NOW!

10:32.703 --> 10:34.034
( all arguing )

10:34.034 --> 10:36.366
OKAY, I'M WARNING YOU.

10:36.366 --> 10:38.669
DO NOT MAKE ME CALL FOR BACKUP.

10:39.810 --> 10:42.773
BECAUSE I DO NOT
HAVE ANY BACKUP.

10:42.773 --> 10:44.915
GUYS, LEO'S RIGHT.

10:44.915 --> 10:46.777
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET IN TROUBLE.

10:46.777 --> 10:47.948
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.650
BUT AT LEAST GRAB SOME YOGURT
BEFORE YOU GO.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.682
I'LL WATCH THE CAR.

10:54.184 --> 10:57.788
NO, NO, NO.

10:57.788 --> 11:00.731
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:00.731 --> 11:01.862
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

11:01.862 --> 11:05.195
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LAY ONE
SLIMY LITTLE FINGER ON THIS CAR.

11:06.436 --> 11:08.668
BEAT IT, EYEBROWS!

11:12.342 --> 11:14.004
DOOR CLOSED.

11:14.004 --> 11:15.675
ACQUIRING FASTEST ROUTE

11:15.675 --> 11:18.248
TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

11:18.248 --> 11:20.380
BOTTOM OF THE WHAT?!

11:22.282 --> 11:25.716
HELP, HELP, HELP!

11:25.716 --> 11:27.818
SAFETY LOCKS ENGAGED.

11:27.818 --> 11:32.262
HELP, HELP!
 DEPARTING IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

11:32.262 --> 11:34.865
AAH!

11:36.066 --> 11:37.898
I'M GONNA MISS THAT LITTLE GUY.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.170
( chuckles ) NO, I'M NOT.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.211
STOP!

11:51.211 --> 11:53.383
YOUR FINAL DESTINATION

11:53.383 --> 11:56.016
IS THE BOTTOM
OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN

11:56.016 --> 11:57.317
AND CANNOT BE OVERRIDDEN.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.320
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR
SOME MUSIC UNTIL WE ARRIVE?

12:00.320 --> 12:02.152
NO!

12:02.152 --> 12:04.294
YOU SAID "DISCO."

12:04.294 --> 12:06.296
( disco music playing )

12:06.296 --> 12:08.228
NO!

12:12.362 --> 12:13.363
UM, WHERE'S LEO?

12:13.363 --> 12:15.105
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
WHERE'S THE CAR?

12:15.105 --> 12:18.408
EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY,
WHERE ARE THE NAPKINS?

12:19.910 --> 12:21.741
LEO PROBABLY
WENT FOR A JOYRIDE.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.213
I'LL JUST CALL MY DAD
TO PICK US UP.

12:23.213 --> 12:25.976
HE'S BEEN DYING
TO MEET YOU GUYS.

12:25.976 --> 12:27.747
( phone beeps )

12:27.747 --> 12:29.319
IT'S LEO.

12:29.319 --> 12:31.051
( phone beeps )

12:31.051 --> 12:32.752
LEO, WHERE ARE YOU?

12:32.752 --> 12:36.056
I'M TRAPPED IN THE CAR SPEEDING
TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN!

12:36.056 --> 12:40.130
DO SOMETHING OR THE NEXT TIME
YOU SEE ME I'M GONNA BE
A FISH STICK!

12:40.130 --> 12:41.261
( phone beeps )

12:41.261 --> 12:43.964
GUYS, LEO'S IN TROUBLE.
WE HAVE TO GO HELP HIM.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.335
SORRY, MARCUS, WE GOTTA GO.

12:45.335 --> 12:46.997
WAIT, YOU CAN'T GO YET!

12:46.997 --> 12:51.071
WE HAVEN'T TAKEN A PICTURE
WITH THE FROYO-A-GO-GO DODO!

12:51.071 --> 12:52.042
OH, RIGHT!

12:54.774 --> 12:55.946
( camera shutter clicks )

12:55.946 --> 12:57.307
HUH? NOW WE'RE GOOD.

13:05.155 --> 13:09.059
HEY, LEO, THE LEFT PEDAL
IS CALLED A BRAKE.

13:09.059 --> 13:11.361
TAKE YOUR FOOT
AND STEP ON IT!

13:11.361 --> 13:15.065
DON'T YOU THINK I WOULD
HAVE TRIED THAT ALREADY?!

13:15.065 --> 13:18.268
HEY, IF YOU CAN'T BE POLITE,
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.201
( sighs )

13:21.201 --> 13:23.033
LEO, I'LL USE
YOUR CELL SIGNAL

13:23.033 --> 13:26.006
TO LOCATE THE CAR
WITH MY BIONIC GPS.

13:27.437 --> 13:31.882
( beeping )

13:31.882 --> 13:33.914
GOT HIM.
TAYLOR AVENUE AND 28th.

13:33.914 --> 13:36.316
I'LL USE MY SUPER-SPEED
TO CATCH UP TO THE CAR
AND PULL HIM OUT.

13:42.292 --> 13:43.353
AAH!

13:45.195 --> 13:47.027
OPEN THE DOOR!

13:47.027 --> 13:48.328
I CAN'T!

13:48.328 --> 13:51.031
THE CHILD SAFETY LOCK
IS ALWAYS ENGAGED

13:51.031 --> 13:53.333
FOR PASSENGERS
UNDER THE AGE OF NINE.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.106
I'M 14!

13:56.106 --> 13:58.969
YOU ARE VERY SMALL
FOR YOUR AGE.

14:00.470 --> 14:02.242
LOOK FOR THE EMERGENCY BRAKE!

14:02.242 --> 14:04.114
MAYBE THIS IS IT!

14:04.114 --> 14:06.246
TURBO-BOOSTER ENGAGED.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.347
AAH!

14:09.449 --> 14:11.451
THAT WASN'T IT!

14:16.226 --> 14:17.958
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

14:17.958 --> 14:20.430
YOU KNOW THOSE SIGNS
THAT SAY "DEER CROSSING"?

14:20.430 --> 14:22.132
THEY DON'T LIE.

14:24.194 --> 14:26.266
I DON'T KNOW HOW
WE'RE GONNA STOP THAT CAR.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.438
WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK
THE OCEAN'S GONNA STOP IT?

14:30.170 --> 14:33.173
IF THE CAR IS BEING DRIVEN
BY AN INTERNAL COMPUTER SYSTEM,

14:33.173 --> 14:36.276
MAYBE I CAN TAP INTO IT REMOTELY
AND SHUT IT DOWN.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.478
HANG ON, LEO,
I'M GONNA TRY SOMETHING.

14:40.110 --> 14:43.153
( beeping )

14:48.458 --> 14:51.922
( horn honking )

14:51.922 --> 14:55.565
( radio static )

14:55.565 --> 14:57.397
WELL, CHASE, YOU COMPLETED

14:57.397 --> 14:59.930
THE 14-POINT
MAINTENANCE CHECKLIST.

14:59.930 --> 15:03.203
NOW ALL WE NEED IS AN OIL CHANGE
AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO!

15:06.436 --> 15:07.507
TASHA...

15:07.507 --> 15:08.508
MM-HMM?

15:08.508 --> 15:12.242
EDDY WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE.

15:12.242 --> 15:13.984
GO AHEAD, EDDY.

15:13.984 --> 15:19.219
I JUST WANNA SAY
I'M VERY S-S-S-S-S-SO-SO...

15:19.219 --> 15:22.292
ARE YOU FAKING A MALFUNCTION?
HE IS FAKING A MALFUNCTION!

15:22.292 --> 15:23.293
EDDY!

15:23.293 --> 15:25.956
OKAY, OKAY!

15:25.956 --> 15:28.128
I'M SORRY.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.329
THANK YOU.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.231
SORRY YOU LIVE HERE. HA!

15:31.231 --> 15:32.432
THAT'S IT.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.434
I'M GOING TO THE LAB
TO SHUT YOU DOWN.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.966
NO, NO! PLEASE!

15:35.966 --> 15:39.339
TASHA, HONEY, BABY,
YOU GOTTA HELP ME!

15:39.339 --> 15:41.311
I'LL GIVE YOU
ANYTHING YOU WANT!

15:41.311 --> 15:44.314
I WANT TOTAL CONTROL
OF YOUR MUTE BUTTON.

15:44.314 --> 15:45.645
FINE.

15:45.645 --> 15:49.279
AND I WANT YOU TO STOP
TAUNTING MY BOOK CLUB.

15:49.279 --> 15:51.251
FINE! THEN YOU BETTER TELL
THE CREEPY LITTLE ONE

15:51.251 --> 15:53.253
TO STOP PUSHING MY BUTTONS!

15:53.253 --> 15:55.125
AND NO MORE
CALLING ANIMAL CONTROL

15:55.125 --> 15:57.287
REPORTING A WILD BEAR
ROAMING THE KITCHEN!

15:57.287 --> 16:01.161
TO BE FAIR, YOU HAD YOUR SNOUT
PRETTY DEEP IN THAT SALMON.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.234
OKAY, YOU'VE GOT A DEAL!

16:04.234 --> 16:05.565
GREAT.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.498
THEN I WILL TELL HIM
NOT TO SHUT YOU OFF.

16:08.498 --> 16:10.300
THANK YOU!

16:10.300 --> 16:11.341
STARTING TOMORROW.

16:11.341 --> 16:13.703
WHAT? NO! YOU TRICKED ME!

16:13.703 --> 16:16.206
YOUR BOOK CLUB IS STUPID...

16:16.206 --> 16:20.180
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO ME.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.182
I WONDER IF THERE'S
ANY SALMON LEFT.

16:25.615 --> 16:27.617
OKAY, THE CAR
WON'T LET ME TAP INTO ITS CPU,

16:27.617 --> 16:29.289
BUT WHAT IF THERE WAS A WAY

16:29.289 --> 16:31.291
FOR ME TO BLOCK
ITS SATELLITE SIGNAL?

16:31.291 --> 16:33.323
BUT IS YOUR FORCE FIELD
POWERFUL ENOUGH?

16:33.323 --> 16:35.665
WELL, YEAH, BUT I'D HAVE
TO SURROUND THE ENTIRE CAR,

16:35.665 --> 16:37.497
WHICH IS MILES AWAY
AND MOVING FAST.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.329
I COULD NEVER THROW THAT FAR.

16:39.329 --> 16:41.271
YOU CAN'T, BUT I CAN!

16:43.303 --> 16:45.105
YES, YOU CAN!

16:45.105 --> 16:46.406
IF I CAN CALCULATE
THE DISTANCE,

16:46.406 --> 16:49.039
ARC, AND FORCE
NECESSARY TO LAUNCH,

16:49.039 --> 16:51.341
I CAN GUIDE YOUR ARM
AND USE YOUR STRENGTH

16:51.341 --> 16:53.443
TO HURL THE FORCE FIELD
AT THE CAR.

16:53.443 --> 16:56.716
AH, SO IT'S LIKE
A BIONIC-BRO COMBO!

16:56.716 --> 16:58.718
A BRO-MOTION! A BRO-TATION!
A SUPER BIONIC BRO-CHACHO--

16:58.718 --> 17:01.221
JUST DO IT ALREADY!

17:02.222 --> 17:04.523
Leo: HURRY, HURRY!

17:04.523 --> 17:06.396
OKAY, WE'VE ONLY GOT ONE CHANCE.

17:06.396 --> 17:08.328
YOU GOTTA THINK OF IT
LIKE A BASKETBALL.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.460
WE'RE SHOOTING A FULL-COURT SHOT
ACROSS 98 COURTS

17:10.460 --> 17:14.604
THAT ARE MOVING
AT 125 MILES PER HOUR.

17:14.604 --> 17:17.137
YEAH, NUMBERS, NUMBERS,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.309
JUST TELL ME WHAT I'M CHUCKING.

17:20.470 --> 17:24.473
FIFTEEN SECONDS TO DESTINATION.

17:24.473 --> 17:26.346
GUYS, I'M SORRY.

17:26.346 --> 17:27.477
YOU'RE TRYING TO RESCUE ME

17:27.477 --> 17:29.549
WHEN I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
PROTECTING YOU.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.051
I GUESS I WASN'T
A VERY GOOD ENFORCER.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.653
NO, YOU WEREN'T.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.426
JUST GET READY.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.433
GET ON YOUR KNEES.

17:43.433 --> 17:44.494
( sighs )

17:49.369 --> 17:51.801
DESTINATION APPROACHING.

17:59.379 --> 18:00.750
( beeping )

18:00.750 --> 18:02.282
PERFECT.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.383
ALL RIGHT.

18:03.383 --> 18:06.586
THREE, TWO, ONE, NOW!

18:06.586 --> 18:07.657
( both grunt )

18:11.090 --> 18:12.091
( camera shutter clicks )

18:12.091 --> 18:13.393
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS,

18:13.393 --> 18:15.465
BUT IT'S GOING ON
MY PROFILE PAGE.

18:18.268 --> 18:19.299
EW.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.600
LET'S SEE IF IT WORKED.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.373
( beeping )

18:26.736 --> 18:30.340
FIVE SECONDS TO DESTINATION.

18:30.340 --> 18:33.613
FOUR, THREE, TWO...

18:35.715 --> 18:37.487
( tires screech )

18:37.487 --> 18:39.319
( grunts )

18:39.319 --> 18:44.294
SIGNAL INTERRUPTED.
BRAKING SYSTEM ENGAGED.

18:44.294 --> 18:46.426
IT WORKED! THE CAR STOPPED!

18:46.426 --> 18:47.797
YEAH!

18:47.797 --> 18:52.632
AH! AH-HA! AH!
( chuckles )

18:52.632 --> 18:54.634
NO!

18:57.607 --> 19:00.440
THANK YOU FOR DRIVING
A DAVENPORT SUPER CAR.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.141
WOULD YOU CARE
TO PARTICIPATE

19:02.141 --> 19:04.414
IN A SHORT SURVEY
ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE?

19:04.414 --> 19:06.676
NO!

19:06.676 --> 19:08.418
QUESTION NUMBER ONE--

19:08.418 --> 19:10.480
LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT!

19:14.153 --> 19:16.456
( both exhale deeply )

19:16.456 --> 19:19.459
YOU GUYS MAY HAVE SAVED MY LIFE,
BUT YOU ALSO ALMOST ENDED IT.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.361
SO YOU'RE NOT OFF THE HOOK.

19:22.562 --> 19:25.395
I'M GONNA BE ON YOU
LIKE YOGURT ON ADAM'S SHIRT.

19:27.497 --> 19:30.470
HMM. THAT IS NOT YOGURT.

19:32.242 --> 19:33.243
HEY!

19:34.874 --> 19:39.449
DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH TROUBLE YOU'RE IN?

19:40.680 --> 19:43.513
I TOLD YOU,
THREE FEET AWAY AT ALL TIMES,

19:43.513 --> 19:47.186
AND NO BREATHING ON THE WINDOWS!

19:47.186 --> 19:48.658
( chuckles ) SORRY.

19:48.658 --> 19:51.521
SORRY. IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
 SORRY. I'LL BE IN MY CAPSULE.

19:57.227 --> 19:59.529
( doorbell rings )

20:03.333 --> 20:06.636
OH, HEY. PERHAPS
I HAVEN'T MADE THIS CLEAR,
BUT I DON'T LIKE YOU.

20:10.380 --> 20:13.343
LEO, I AM SO HAPPY
YOU'RE HOME SAFE!

20:13.343 --> 20:17.216
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU ALMOST ENDED UP
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN!

20:17.216 --> 20:21.351
WAIT, HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHERE THE CAR WAS SET TO GO?

20:22.392 --> 20:24.624
I DIDN'T?

20:24.624 --> 20:27.627
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU SABOTAGED ME!

20:27.627 --> 20:30.460
YOU PROGRAMMED THAT CAR!
I'M GONNA TELL DAVENPORT!

20:35.365 --> 20:37.467
I WOULDN'T DO THAT
IF I WERE YOU.

20:37.467 --> 20:38.968
THAT WAS A WARNING SHOT.

20:38.968 --> 20:40.570
NEXT ONE WON'T BE.

20:40.570 --> 20:43.413
YOU? WITH-TH--

20:43.413 --> 20:49.549
SURPRISE! I'M BIONIC,
JUST LIKE ADAM, BREE, AND CHASE.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.020
AND YOU KNOW ABOUT--

20:51.020 --> 20:54.253
OKAY, YOU ARE JUST
DROPPIN' BOMBS EVERYWHERE, MAN!

20:54.253 --> 20:57.587
YOU TELL ANYONE
AND THE WHOLE WORLD

20:57.587 --> 20:59.889
WILL KNOW ABOUT
YOUR FAMILY'S LITTLE SECRET.

20:59.889 --> 21:02.562
ADAM, BREE, AND CHASE
WILL BE TAKEN AWAY.

21:02.562 --> 21:05.295
DAVENPORT WOULD BE
RUINED FOREVER.

21:05.295 --> 21:08.898
( scoffs ) YOU KNOW, I'D HATE
TO SEE YOUR FAMILY TORN APART

21:08.898 --> 21:12.602
BECAUSE OF YOUR BIG MOUTH.

21:16.706 --> 21:17.977
HEY, MARCUS. WHAT'S UP?

21:17.977 --> 21:19.509
OH, HEY, GUYS.

21:19.509 --> 21:21.611
I JUST STOPPED BY
TO MAKE SURE LEO WAS OKAY.

21:21.611 --> 21:25.355
HOW SWEET IS THIS GUY?

21:26.356 --> 21:27.387
YOU OKAY, LEO?

21:28.518 --> 21:29.519
LEO, YOU GOOD?

21:30.520 --> 21:33.423
UH, YEAH. YEAH, I'M GOOD.

21:39.729 --> 21:42.502
GUYS, YOU FORGOT TO GAS UP
DAVENPORT'S CAR!

21:42.502 --> 21:43.633
LUCKILY I WAS SMART ENOUGH

21:43.633 --> 21:46.606
TO FILL IT UP WITH THE GAS CAN
IN THE GARAGE.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.538
ADAM, IT'S AN ELECTRIC CAR.

21:48.538 --> 21:49.539
MM-HMM.

21:49.539 --> 21:50.710
IT DOESN'T TAKE GAS!

21:50.710 --> 21:52.382
ONE SPARK
AND THAT THING COULD--

21:52.382 --> 21:53.683
OH, BOY.

21:53.683 --> 21:56.686
HEY, GUYS,
I'M GONNA GO FOR A DRIVE.

21:56.686 --> 21:57.617
All: NO!

22:03.653 --> 22:06.626
AAH!

22:06.626 --> 22:08.498
WELL, AT LEAST
HE DOESN'T KNOW WE DROVE IT.

22:08.498 --> 22:10.029
AAH!
