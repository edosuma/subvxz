when Portman Road
started expanding its football team.

05:07.938 --> 05:10.818
And a new stadium went up that...

to come up this way.

- She said, "Call the police." And I did.

05:27.187 --> 05:31.856
...makes it really hard for me
to have much sympathy

She's in the car.

sort of moving off?" I said, "Just..."

05:42.395 --> 05:44.694

"if you keep on at me,

to burn your house down."

here again, I'm gonna call the police.

06:01.560 --> 06:05.020
(Julie) It was... it was absolutely awful.

06:05.060 --> 06:08.319
They wrecked...
wrecked our, my evenings.

06:08.351 --> 06:10.189
You know, they're on my streets.

06:10.226 --> 06:12.194
You know, my children are out at night.

06:12.268 --> 06:14.271
I've got, I've got a teenage girl.

I've got, I've got a 14-year old.

06:16.226 --> 06:20.315
I don't want girls...
erm... doing what they did in the streets.

06:20.768 --> 06:24.193
And they weren't just...
getting in people's cars.

06:24.226 --> 06:27.022
They were doing it in the alleyways
and everything else.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.233
(Gordon) They certainly weren't angels.

06:35.267 --> 06:38.776
Lots of them talking about them
being lovely girls and everything,

06:38.809 --> 06:42.980
but in all our experience
they were... foul-mouthed slags

06:43.059 --> 06:44.480
who'd stab you as quick as...

06:44.517 --> 06:47.279
- That's an exaggeration.
- It's a slight exaggeration.

06:47.309 --> 06:48.779
They did pester you.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.479
They'd rob you
as much as anything else.

06:50.517 --> 06:51.903
Yeah.

06:52.850 --> 06:55.267
(Rosemary) No, because people,
kerb crawlers,

06:55.350 --> 06:57.435
sort of upset people's children, you know.

06:57.475 --> 07:00.153
Daughters and things.
And then there's the girls.

07:00.225 --> 07:03.187
I mean, you coming back from football
and things like that.

07:03.225 --> 07:06.851

of propositioned, you know. Sort of.

(Julie) It's been like this for years,
but I don't want my children to see that.

07:14.224 --> 07:17.234
We all wanted to move.
We didn't want to be here.

07:17.349 --> 07:20.525
Then these girls...
just going missing

07:20.558 --> 07:24.148
and... and being found
the way they... they were found.

07:25.515 --> 07:27.104
It was a complete nightmare.

07:27.265 --> 07:30.228

07:30.307 --> 07:33.518
Oh, the most wonderful time

07:33.641 --> 07:37.776
Oh,
the most wonderful time

07:37.806 --> 07:41.813
Of the year

07:41.848 --> 07:45.308
Everyone is very, very nervous... erm

07:45.390 --> 07:48.601

from a LOT of people.

that's ever... ever happened in Ipswich.

Definitely changed the mood

08:20.138 --> 08:24.476

You find that I'm walking through thinking

08:24.513 --> 08:26.065
"Well, is it him? Is it him?"

08:28.388 --> 08:32.062
Yeah, I think it's put Ipswich
On the map

08:32.096 --> 08:34.229
For the wrong reasons, unfortunately

08:34.261 --> 08:35.602
It's the most wonderful time...

from nish-noff land.

- And we'll send the fuckers all back.

and we don't know.

11:33.631 --> 11:35.965

Always utter rubbish on Suffolk Radio.

Well, we've never had
anything like that before. No.

We're all a bit... frightened
to go out at night. Yeah.

12:18.879 --> 12:22.339

12:23.004 --> 12:25.683
Some people say that
they're terrified of going anywhere.

12:25.713 --> 12:28.178
Well, goodness me, there's a...

12:28.212 --> 12:30.465

chucked acid over you

12:40.461 --> 12:43.177
It's... Standing here, you can feel it.

No, we're not.
No, we're not. No, we're not!

12:48.170 --> 12:52.093
Just one person is or whatever ends up
being the final tally, but...

12:52.128 --> 12:53.799
No, we're not.

You automatically think it could be him

That's the scary thing
That he could be amongst us

13:06.835 --> 13:10.047
And look walking around with us
Every day and we don't know

13:10.085 --> 13:11.887

Now I'm thinking about it

13:29.168 --> 13:31.467

In various different areas
Surrounding Ipswich

14:00.459 --> 14:03.173
One ten minutes away from my house
Which is scary

14:03.208 --> 14:06.503
And it was found on the body on the land
Of a girl that goes to my school

14:06.542 --> 14:07.798
- So that's a bit scary
- Yeah

14:07.833 --> 14:10.963
I used to go out every Friday and
Saturday night and I don't go out any more

14:11.000 --> 14:15.551
It's not safe for young girls and women
Out in Ipswich any more

14:15.584 --> 14:16.875
- It's not safe
- Yeah

14:16.917 --> 14:20.425
It's not safe for young girls and women
Out in Ipswich any more

14:20.458 --> 14:21.928
- It's not safe
- Yeah

14:21.958 --> 14:22.919
As it used to be

14:22.958 --> 14:25.803
It's quite scary to think
How the world's come to this

14:28.125 --> 14:29.511
You automatically think it could be him

14:29.541 --> 14:30.714
Yeah

14:30.749 --> 14:33.298
You automatically think it could be him

14:33.749 --> 14:35.882
Like, anyone
It could be anyone in here

14:35.916 --> 14:41.842
Like, anyone
It could be anyone in here for all we know

14:41.874 --> 14:43.675
Which has now really scared me

14:43.790 --> 14:45.426
I'm just gonna, like, cry...

14:45.540 --> 14:47.294
Ha-ha!

14:47.415 --> 14:50.509
You automatically think it could be him

14:50.624 --> 14:52.591
You automatically think it could be him

14:53.582 --> 14:55.549
It could be him

14:55.873 --> 14:57.758
Something like this happens
And you realise that there's so much

14:57.790 --> 15:01.215
So many things that are bad in the world
That's the fire alarm

15:01.248 --> 15:02.421
We're all going to die...

15:02.456 --> 15:05.088
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

15:06.415 --> 15:08.501
(Laughing raucously)

15:10.290 --> 15:11.499
(Gasps)

15:13.248 --> 15:16.293
- But it's exciting
- Cos nothing ever happens in Ipswich

15:16.331 --> 15:19.211
This is the first bit
Of local scandal we've ever had

15:19.247 --> 15:23.005
Being girls, gossip mongers
We're like, "it's quite exciting"

15:23.039 --> 15:25.670
- It's quite exciting
- Yeah, yeah

15:25.706 --> 15:28.088
You automatically think it could be him

15:28.830 --> 15:31.047
You automatically think it could be him

15:31.081 --> 15:32.123
Yeah

15:32.163 --> 15:33.799
Like, anyone
It could be anyone in here

15:33.830 --> 15:36.591
Like, anyone
It could be anyone in here for all we know

15:36.622 --> 15:40.000
Which has now really scared me
I'm just gonna, like, cry

15:40.038 --> 15:41.508
Hm. W

15:41.538 --> 15:42.878
It could be anyone here

15:42.913 --> 15:44.833
Which has now really soared me
Now I'm thinking about it

15:44.871 --> 15:47.503
I'm just gonna, like, cry
Ha-ha

15:48.372 --> 15:50.671
You automatically think it could be him

15:51.830 --> 15:55.622
You automatically think it could be him
It could be him

16:01.412 --> 16:03.665
You automatically think it could be him

16:03.704 --> 16:04.712
Yeah

16:04.746 --> 16:07.507
You automatically think it could be him

16:07.788 --> 16:10.584
That's the scary thing
That he could be amongst us

16:10.620 --> 16:13.666
Walking around with us every day
And we're... we don't know

16:13.704 --> 16:14.830
Yeah

16:15.412 --> 16:17.296
We don't know

16:19.870 --> 16:23.379
You've got this feeling of suspicious
by everybody.

16:24.453 --> 16:27.001
Upon everybody else.

16:28.579 --> 16:30.663
Is it him? Is it him?

16:30.704 --> 16:34.164
Is it him? Is it him? I dunno.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.124
Yeah.

Would have been fine with going with him

Er, for each girl there was a team,

20:41.402 --> 20:44.413
a different team,
and they all questioned us.

20:44.527 --> 20:46.826
And it... it was getting awful.

20:46.860 --> 20:50.819
We were so getting fed up
with just being asked, you know.

20:50.943 --> 20:54.403
They were asking if you had nose hair.

20:54.568 --> 20:56.120
Ear hair.

Wha... wha... Goodness knows
why they wanted to know that.

Police kept issuing these strange things
about what you should and shouldn't do,

21:06.651 --> 21:10.527
but they never said, "Don't be a
prostitute and get into a stranger's car,"

21:10.651 --> 21:13.329
which was the obvious thing, really,
wasn't it?

21:13.442 --> 21:16.239
Cos everyone else was quite safe
walking the streets.

21:16.360 --> 21:20.863
We assumed particularly when, I mean,
it was just prostitutes he seemed to be...

21:21.442 --> 21:23.077
Murdering.

questions, you know, that was really...

(June) I thought
he was gonna be arrested.

There was a knock on the door. Terry said,
"You're wanted. In the lounge. Police."

21:34.233 --> 21:38.405
He was doing every house.
Every single house in London Road.

21:38.525 --> 21:42.696
Er, your mind goes blank. "Where was
you on Monday night?" sort of thing.

21:42.816 --> 21:47.532
Can't remember exactly the date. And you
think, "Well, where was I'? What did I do?"

21:47.649 --> 21:51.786
Then he said, "What colour...? Have you
got blue eyes?" I said yes I think.

21:51.816 --> 21:52.906
Yeah, you said yes.

21:52.941 --> 21:55.868
Then he said,
"Have you got a hairy chest?"

21:55.982 --> 21:59.858
And I looked at him and thought,
you know, "Where is this leading to?"

22:16.274 --> 22:19.402
(Siren wails)

22:23.565 --> 22:29.740

Were police cars going up the road

Me son rung me on his mo...

On, on my home phone
I said, "Where are you?"

22:55.731 --> 22:58.941
He said, "I'm down the road but you need
To tell the police that I'm your son"

22:58.981 --> 23:00.817
I said, "Why? What have you done?"

23:03.397 --> 23:05.898
And that's when it all started
it all kicked off

23:07.146 --> 23:09.944
He said, "No, no, no
We're not allowed down the road"

23:10.063 --> 23:13.690
And lo and behold there was police
There was cameras, there was my son

It all started
It all kicked off

23:15.896 --> 23:17.283

And it's all you saw

23:17.313 --> 23:19.861

And I thought, "Oh, no
There's another prostitute been found"

23:56.436 --> 24:00.395
(Ron) I got up
And all I could see were police cars

24:00.686 --> 24:02.191

24:02.311 --> 24:06.779

It all kicked off

24:45.143 --> 24:47.027
Then we started hearing on the news

24:48.434 --> 24:52.192
That someone had been arrested there
Or someone had been arrested

24:52.935 --> 24:56.312

Two and two together and said

28:28.676 --> 28:30.063
Can we go down that way?

28:30.176 --> 28:32.677
(Policeman)
I'm afraid you have to go round.

28:32.801 --> 28:34.769
- Back round 'ere?
- Yes. Sorry about that.

28:34.801 --> 28:36.271
It's all right.

28:36.426 --> 28:40.562
- When's this gonna be over?
- I don't know. Wouldn't be able to say.

28:40.676 --> 28:43.722
- Friday?
- I wouldn't know. I would be guessing.

28:43.842 --> 28:46.094
- Saturday?
- I'd be guessing at Saturday as well!

28:46.134 --> 28:48.635
- Sunday?
- No. I dunno.

28:48.759 --> 28:52.018
Monday's Christmas!
It can't be Monday! (Chuckles)

28:54.008 --> 28:57.102
- Can we just come here?
- Yeah. No worries about that bit.

28:57.258 --> 29:01.679
It's against the law. I don't know whether
I'm coming or going round this area!

29:01.799 --> 29:04.182
You're not allowed
through that bit basically.

29:04.216 --> 29:06.432
Have you got the man that done it then?

29:06.550 --> 29:10.602
- They won't even tell us.
- Won't they? I know the girls.

29:10.632 --> 29:14.011
Mind you, flippin' half the town,
if you were to pull 'em in,

29:14.049 --> 29:15.969
probably went with them girls.

29:16.091 --> 29:17.477
Except for yours truly.

29:17.507 --> 29:19.261
- Hopefully not yourself?
- No!

29:19.299 --> 29:22.759
Cos I won't give 5O quid
to a little scaggy little whore.

29:24.758 --> 29:29.178
No. Anyway, looks like my relief's
turned up, so I'm gonna get a coffee.

29:30.007 --> 29:33.800
- Can't be a bad thing. Take care anyway.
- OK. And you.

29:40.132 --> 29:43.592
(Gordon) I think it was policing
as we'd like to see it every time.

29:43.632 --> 29:47.589
Bobbies standing at your house,
making sure no nasty people got near you.

29:47.632 --> 29:49.848
You'd feel like
the Prime Minister, wouldn't you?

29:49.881 --> 29:54.468
Yeah. The road was ever so quiet and
nobody stole our festive wreath this year.

29:54.590 --> 29:55.716
Yeah.

29:56.589 --> 29:59.683
(Jan) If somebody knows
you live opposite, they wanna know...

29:59.714 --> 30:03.767
Think you've got inside information,
which I... you haven't.

30:03.881 --> 30:07.140
You've just got what's in the...
journalists are saying.

30:07.255 --> 30:09.839
The police
don't tell you anything, do they?

30:09.964 --> 30:12.098
(Tim) They're not allowed to, are they?

30:12.673 --> 30:16.346
(Julie) We had no post. No bin men.

30:18.005 --> 30:22.510
Erm... if we had post,
the postman had to be escorted by police.

30:23.172 --> 30:24.843
Inside the cordon.

30:25.380 --> 30:28.095

'It's half-past ten.

A very dramatic announcement
last night, late last night,

31:22.836 --> 31:25.763
that Steven Wright was charged
with these five murders.

31:32.170 --> 31:36.554
I've been here since about half-nine

31:36.669 --> 31:41.006
I just saw him come along
Like, with the police sirens and that

31:41.044 --> 31:43.130
And they were, you know

31:44.627 --> 31:46.844
None of the photographers caught him

31:48.627 --> 31:51.554
Caught any photos of him
Or anything but...

31:53.627 --> 31:55.712
Just waiting to get a glimpse, really

31:55.835 --> 31:57.803
Just waiting to get a glimpse, really

31:57.835 --> 32:01.841
His name is Steven Wright.
He's 48. He's a fork-lift truck driver.

32:01.959 --> 32:03.549
He's from London Road in Ipswich.

32:03.585 --> 32:05.090
That's pretty well it.

32:05.209 --> 32:08.386
I tell you, if I get hold of him...
huh,huh,huh!

32:08.501 --> 32:12.294
I really...
I've never seen anything like it.

32:13.626 --> 32:16.920
I said to my brother
I said, "What's going on?"

32:17.043 --> 32:18.548
I said, "What's happened?"

32:18.584 --> 32:23.005
He says, he says, "Cos the bloke"

32:23.042 --> 32:27.261
He said
"He's in court this morning, isn't he?"

32:27.292 --> 32:32.258
And then when I came up here I thought
"Oh, my word! Am I gonna get parked?"

32:32.375 --> 32:35.053
Cos they've taken
All the spaces along here

32:35.167 --> 32:36.886
(Residents) Oh, dear?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.762
- Yeah, look at this, look at this
- It's horrible, innit, eh?

32:41.999 --> 32:44.133
It's a wicked bloody world

32:49.416 --> 32:51.217
It's a wicked bloody world...

32:51.333 --> 32:53.501
I'm just hearing some sirens, actually,

32:53.625 --> 32:55.959
and as he's gonna come
from this direction,

32:56.083 --> 32:58.465
we'll just turn our camera round that way.

32:58.582 --> 33:02.719
So that we do actually see this convoy
when it happens. Turn round this way.

33:02.833 --> 33:05.547
They're obviously on the verge
Of bringing him out

33:05.582 --> 33:07.550
Cos the position the cars are in

33:07.666 --> 33:11.043
The position, the cars, the police
They're all in position, look

33:11.082 --> 33:14.258
They're obviously on the verge
Of bringing him out

33:14.415 --> 33:16.086
Cos the position the cars are in

33:16.207 --> 33:18.292
The position, the cars, the police
They're all in position, look

33:19.540 --> 33:22.041
You look around and you think
"Well, you know"

33:22.165 --> 33:24.085
"Have they got the right...?"

33:24.207 --> 33:27.252
He said
"He's in court this morning, isn't he?"

33:27.290 --> 33:30.005
And then when I came up here
I thought, "Oh, my word!"

33:30.123 --> 33:35.088
- The position of the cars, the police
- ...spaces along here

33:35.206 --> 33:36.462
Hello...

33:36.497 --> 33:41.132
Police motorbikes coming up the road,
not from the direction we were expecting,

33:41.247 --> 33:42.966
so I imagine it's not the convoy.

33:42.997 --> 33:44.633
Mum. <i>Wm</i> mung m...

33:44.747 --> 33:46.039
It might be, actually.

33:46.622 --> 33:48.293
They're closing in

33:48.456 --> 33:50.257
He's obviously coming out...

33:50.289 --> 33:51.462
I think it is.

33:51.581 --> 33:53.963
(Residents) They're closing in
That's why the police

33:54.081 --> 33:56.249
I could see them stopping traffic
Up there an' all

33:56.288 --> 33:57.461
Oh, dear

33:58.497 --> 34:01.212
Yeah, look at this, look at this
It's horrible, innit, eh?

34:01.789 --> 34:03.957
It's a wicked bloody world

34:03.996 --> 34:05.206
(Shouting)

34:06.164 --> 34:08.665
It looks like we've got Steven Wright now.

34:09.996 --> 34:14.168
And here we have full convoy near!
Steven Wright!

34:14.288 --> 34:16.621
'48-year-old fork-lift truck driver.'

34:19.288 --> 34:21.621

34:25.788 --> 34:27.706
You piece of shit!

34:27.829 --> 34:29.380
You're fucking dead!

34:29.496 --> 34:30.882
Yeah, look at this, look at this

34:30.911 --> 34:33.045
It's horrible, innit, eh? It's horrible

34:33.161 --> 34:34.583
(Raucous shouting)

34:34.704 --> 34:36.090
It's a wicked bloody world

34:36.120 --> 34:37.755
Yeah, look at this, look at this

It's horrible, innit, eh?
It's horrible, innit, eh?

34:40.454 --> 34:44.043
It's a wicked bloody
It's a wicked bloody, it's a wicked bloody

34:44.161 --> 34:47.337
It's a wicked bloody world!

34:48.870 --> 34:51.288
Bloody hell!

34:52.536 --> 34:54.338
Couldn't see. Couldn't see.

34:54.495 --> 34:57.624
- I don't think he was in that van.
- He was.

34:57.745 --> 34:59.830
He's definitely in the back of the van.

35:00.495 --> 35:04.038
- Waste of time, wasn't it?
- It's a disgrace.

35:04.161 --> 35:06.247
(indistinct muttering)

35:13.953 --> 35:16.500

Oi. Hey! Get away then!

37:34.322 --> 37:36.408
(Train chugging in the distance)

37:49.863 --> 37:51.949
We're really upset

37:52.613 --> 37:55.659
(He sighs)

37:55.779 --> 37:58.991
I just wanted him...
It to be all over

37:59.113 --> 38:01.281
And to know

38:02.738 --> 38:07.703
Were tho... were those prostitutes
Killed in that house?

38:10.529 --> 38:12.781
He was only there for ten weeks

38:12.904 --> 38:14.539
Ten weeks

38:15.487 --> 38:17.621
He was only there for ten weeks

38:17.737 --> 38:19.656
Ten weeks

38:19.696 --> 38:25.289
(Both) It's just a chance
The one place in the... in the whole world

38:25.446 --> 38:29.949
Where... he went to live for ten weeks

38:30.695 --> 38:32.117
Could have been anywhere

38:32.237 --> 38:34.571
Could have been next door to you

38:34.695 --> 38:36.947
Could have been next door to you

38:38.945 --> 38:42.074
Everybody would rather it all went away

38:43.111 --> 38:45.494
They must have sleepless nights

38:45.611 --> 38:47.033
I know I do

38:47.069 --> 38:51.324
It was awful. I was very upset.

38:51.486 --> 38:56.487
In the evening, you know,
I'd just close the curtains and erm...

38:57.403 --> 39:01.279
It really made me very depressed and low.
I just feel it's...

39:01.444 --> 39:03.909
- I think there's a...
- It's like a dream still.

39:04.027 --> 39:07.038
I, I don't know.
I don't think I've really...

39:07.152 --> 39:09.202
- I think...
- Really come to accept it.

39:09.318 --> 39:14.699
I... try to... keep going.

39:19.193 --> 39:20.484
(Door closes)

39:20.527 --> 39:23.869
Nobody walks...
nobody walks down that road with, with...

39:23.901 --> 39:27.694
And I'm the same.
Without staring at that house.

39:27.818 --> 39:30.828
During the day I had
quite a bit of trouble with children.

39:30.984 --> 39:35.286
M. ma: wmflm ma mug; mm.

39:35.859 --> 39:38.870
One of them threatened me talking about,

39:38.984 --> 39:43.369
"He's a murderer and everything.
You should move" and...

39:54.650 --> 39:56.902
He was only there for ten weeks

39:57.025 --> 39:58.992
Ten weeks

39:59.609 --> 40:01.860
He was only there for ten weeks

40:01.983 --> 40:03.535
(Both) Ten weeks

40:03.566 --> 40:05.118
It's just a chance

40:05.233 --> 40:10.827

In the... in the whole world where he...

40:11.649 --> 40:14.233
Went to live for ten weeks

40:15.025 --> 40:18.284
Could have been anywhere
Could have been next door to you

Everybody would rather it all went away

40:26.982 --> 40:29.483
They must have sleepless nights

40:29.608 --> 40:31.408
I know I do

40:32.857 --> 40:36.484
When they boarded the house up,
that's when I really didn't like it.

40:36.523 --> 40:40.198
- We were thinking of moving.
- Well, you were, particularly.

40:40.232 --> 40:42.862
It just sort of de-de-depressed me.

40:42.982 --> 40:45.281
It depressed me living next door,
you know,

40:45.399 --> 40:48.741
and I just sort of thought,
"Oh, I wanna be in a nice area."

40:53.940 --> 40:57.199
I was thinking about moving once,
I was, yeah.

40:57.356 --> 41:00.780
I'm moving. 14th March.

41:04.481 --> 41:06.567
We're really upset

That he's formally entered a plea

43:39.350 --> 43:42.313
- But it wasn't until two o'clock
- That he stood up

43:42.350 --> 43:46.652
That he stood up
- Dressed in a black suit, white shirt

43:46.767 --> 43:51.068
And blue tie

And confidently when he was asked

43:57.099 --> 44:02.065
How he would plead
To each of the five counts of murder?

44:02.183 --> 44:06.105

They were read out in this order

44:06.224 --> 44:10.312

That were read out in this order

44:57.264 --> 44:58.982
(Reporters) Clara Martin

44:59.096 --> 45:02.522
Her body was the second to be found

45:02.639 --> 45:07.771
Although she was the first woman
To go missing

45:11.596 --> 45:12.888
<i>Anna mm</i>

45:12.929 --> 45:16.639
Her body was, was the first to be found

45:31.220 --> 45:34.729
Was found in... in Acton

45:35.721 --> 45:38.482
Sonia Farrell, Michelle Symonds

45:38.596 --> 45:41.310
Their bodies were of course
Found in Levington

45:41.471 --> 45:43.888
Found of course
A few hundred yards apart

45:44.012 --> 45:47.307
Just a few hundred yards from each other

45:48.678 --> 45:51.439
Inn Levflngwn

45:52.761 --> 45:57.016
(Female reporter) We know that all women
Were working in the town as prostitutes

45:57.136 --> 46:00.313
And all their bodies were found naked

46:00.595 --> 46:04.850
To each one of those counts of murder

Wm m? aim hum)

46:07.178 --> 46:08.648
Not guilty

46:21.177 --> 46:24.685
We thought with everything happening
over the Christmas period,

46:24.802 --> 46:27.764
with the prostitutes going missing
and being murdered,

46:27.802 --> 46:30.978
we needed to get together as a community.

46:31.093 --> 46:34.518
We got a lot of bad press
when it was all going on,

46:34.677 --> 46:38.386
saying sort... Lon, London Road was
a prostitute area and so forth like that,

46:38.427 --> 46:42.303
and we just got absolutely cheesed off
with it as a... as a community.

46:42.343 --> 46:44.809
It is, it's, it's not nice being labelled.

46:45.884 --> 46:51.562
So we got together and... and managed
to get a real good committee going.

47:17.342 --> 47:19.391

47:46.383 --> 47:49.593
Hoping hopefully the problem
With the girls has disappeared

47:49.632 --> 47:51.268
We don't see them now

47:51.424 --> 47:54.185
I believe there are still
A few round in Hanford Road

47:54.299 --> 47:58.435
But, erm, we really can't
Concern ourselves with it

47:58.465 --> 48:00.848
The street has got much better

48:00.965 --> 48:03.975
I think that the police
Have done exceptionally well

48:04.007 --> 48:05.974
Under exceptional circumstances

48:06.090 --> 48:09.101
To clear the streets as they have done

48:09.215 --> 48:11.597
This really is our first AGM

48:12.173 --> 48:14.591
This really is our first AGM

48:15.631 --> 48:17.930
I wanna say thank you to the police

48:17.965 --> 48:21.010
Thank 'em cos representatives here

48:21.131 --> 48:24.058

The county councillors

48:24.173 --> 48:25.559

48:27.131 --> 48:29.348

More, the more the merrier?

48:52.214 --> 48:54.761
Friends, family so...

48:56.130 --> 48:59.590

With your friends and family

49:03.129 --> 49:05.512
Big event on 11th July

49:05.629 --> 49:09.932
To make the area look pretty and that
And getting people involved

49:10.046 --> 49:13.389
And getting interested in their road
And their homes again

49:14.171 --> 49:18.473
If you make your house look nice
And feel good about where you're living

49:18.588 --> 49:21.467
You'll enjoy
You'll enjoy life a hell of a lot better

49:21.504 --> 49:24.964

Your gardens, your designs

49:25.087 --> 49:26.722

I can't use the word "semen".

I can use it at ten o'clock
But I can't use it before teatime

52:24.288 --> 52:25.876

With other organisations
And stuff, you know

01:00:28.729 --> 01:00:32.189

01:00:32.311 --> 01:00:34.397
We've all stopped now

01:00:36.103 --> 01:00:39.315
An' it, an' it has been
Because of the murders

01:00:39.478 --> 01:00:42.405
That's why, like, we've all stopped

01:00:42.436 --> 01:00:44.937

Well, saying that, I've got regulars

01:00:45.062 --> 01:00:49.019

- That phone and we see

01:00:49.144 --> 01:00:50.863
You know, won't work the street

01:00:50.977 --> 01:00:53.561

You know, won't work the street

But we've got a few regulars
That keep us going

01:01:06.310 --> 01:01:09.854
And just do, like, instead of
Hundreds of pounds' worth of drugs a day

01:01:09.977 --> 01:01:14.195
Now all I do is, like
Â£15 worth of drugs a day now

01:01:14.227 --> 01:01:17.107
- If that
- I don't use it every day any more

01:01:17.227 --> 01:01:19.312

To get over that hurdle but...

01:01:22.101 --> 01:01:26.108

You gotta get off, yeah

We've all put on weight, yeah
We wasn't...

01:01:43.434 --> 01:01:46.230

01:12:52.950 --> 01:13:00.500
cos of all red tape and what have you
and town hall, you know, Munchkins...

01:13:03.991 --> 01:13:07.535
...is for the world's press
to come back in three years' time and say,

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:09.869
"This was then. This is now."

01:13:16.907 --> 01:13:22.288
(June) I don't think anybody
really thought that they were bad girls.

01:13:23.366 --> 01:13:25.166
You know, I mean, they were in a way,

01:13:25.282 --> 01:13:28.743
but they weren't hurting anybody else,
were they?

01:13:28.866 --> 01:13:32.208
That was only their selves
they were to hurting, weren't it?

01:13:34.157 --> 01:13:36.623
(Graham) I think we've been scarred.

01:13:37.782 --> 01:13:39.252
Forever.

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:42.618
Women will never trust men again

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:47.492
and men will always... wonder
what women are thinking.

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:54.457
You know, people
have been... yeah, affected by this

01:13:54.573 --> 01:13:58.164
and... I guess they always will.

01:14:01.156 --> 01:14:05.245
I've almost got this mental picture
of when those girls got up to heaven.

01:14:06.156 --> 01:14:10.493
That Saint Peter said, "Come in,"
and they, and they said something like...

01:14:11.572 --> 01:14:15.744
..."Do you mean it's over?
Do you mean it's finished?

01:14:17.948 --> 01:14:21.325
"Do you mean, erm,
they can't hurt me anymore?"

01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:33.665
I can imagine for, erm,
people that lived outside the area

01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:36.458
where the prostitutes
hadn't affected anyone,

01:14:36.488 --> 01:14:38.242
you would get a different opinion.

01:14:38.363 --> 01:14:44.124
You'd get people feeling sorry for them
and so forth... you know.

01:14:45.029 --> 01:14:47.577
I feel sorry for the families,
but not them.

01:14:48.405 --> 01:14:49.826
<i>You know'?</i>

01:14:50.321 --> 01:14:53.864
It was just a pain in the arse.
They were a complete pain in the neck.

01:14:55.612 --> 01:14:57.698
You know, they're...

01:14:57.821 --> 01:15:00.867
mm Imam W... flÂ©ifit under.

01:15:03.029 --> 01:15:07.663
That's a horrible thing to say, isn't it?
But what's happened has happened.

01:15:07.778 --> 01:15:10.789
But I'm not... I'm not sad.

01:15:13.445 --> 01:15:14.867
<i>You know'?</i>

01:15:17.487 --> 01:15:19.371
I'd still shake his hand.

01:15:21.654 --> 01:15:25.529
I'd love to just shake his hand and say,
"Thank you for getting rid of them."

01:15:26.361 --> 01:15:29.407
I mean, I would, you know,
if you had the, at the end of the day,

01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:34.155
if you had the courage to do it,
then... erm...

01:15:34.527 --> 01:15:39.244
I'd shake their hand if I had the courage,
but I would... I wouldn't do it, but...

01:15:40.236 --> 01:15:44.075
I can have that thought in my... my head

01:15:44.194 --> 01:15:46.410
to say, "Yeah, thank you very much."?

01:15:57.777 --> 01:15:59.696
(Footsteps approaching)

01:16:01.276 --> 01:16:04.121
Oh, God!

01:16:09.235 --> 01:16:11.155
WW!

01:16:13.151 --> 01:16:15.865
Oh, wow! It's just...

01:16:15.901 --> 01:16:19.030
Oh, wow! I think they peaked today.

01:16:19.151 --> 01:16:22.410
Well, probably about, like, Wednesday.
Don't you think, Julie?

01:16:22.442 --> 01:16:25.239
(Julie) People have put
hanging baskets out this year

01:16:25.359 --> 01:16:28.949
that have never done hanging baskets
or pots before in their lives.

01:16:29.067 --> 01:16:31.948
But they made a real effort
for London Road In Bloom.

01:16:31.984 --> 01:16:36.285
(Carol) Oh, God! Wow!

01:16:36.734 --> 01:16:39.863
I don't know a weed from a plant, I don't!

01:16:40.025 --> 01:16:41.909
But I did do a... a pot.

01:16:41.942 --> 01:16:44.738
Yes, we got June's pot.

01:16:44.859 --> 01:16:47.406
These are double petunias.

01:16:47.525 --> 01:16:49.942
- I love these. Look!
- Yeah.

01:16:50.067 --> 01:16:55.032
Fantastic! Oh, the gardener's wife!

01:16:55.275 --> 01:16:57.112
(Camera shutter clicks)

01:16:57.233 --> 01:16:59.401
- Animals on the windowsill.
- Where?

01:16:59.566 --> 01:17:02.991
(Gasps) Oh, this is great!

01:17:03.108 --> 01:17:04.945
It's so...

01:17:05.066 --> 01:17:08.491
It's nautical, religious, floral.

01:17:08.607 --> 01:17:11.191
- All of human life is here!
- (Julie) Yeah.

01:17:11.233 --> 01:17:13.994
Oh, look! Fabulous! It's just...

01:17:14.107 --> 01:17:15.659
Look! Gnomes!

01:17:15.773 --> 01:17:20.609
(Laughs) I gotta say,
it's Jesus that does it for me here.

01:17:20.773 --> 01:17:22.658
It's a bit of Lourdes in London Road.

01:17:22.774 --> 01:17:24.195
(Laughs)

01:17:24.315 --> 01:17:26.318
(Julie) Yeah, there's gardens galore.

01:17:27.024 --> 01:17:28.410
Very pleased with it.

01:17:28.524 --> 01:17:30.324
Come on and give me a one

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.827
And a two

01:17:31.939 --> 01:17:34.571
I've been waiting all night
To dance with you...

01:17:34.606 --> 01:17:36.408
Come on! Woo!

01:17:42.939 --> 01:17:45.701
(indistinct conversations and laughter)

01:18:22.438 --> 01:18:24.157
Just help yourself to everything.

01:18:37.937 --> 01:18:40.485
Hi again. I know you. You all right?

01:18:40.604 --> 01:18:44.397
- Nice to see you, Julie. You all right?
- Yes, thank you. I recognise you.

01:18:44.437 --> 01:18:45.942
You're the one!

01:19:04.187 --> 01:19:05.987
Come on and give me a one

01:19:06.103 --> 01:19:08.319
And a two

01:19:08.437 --> 01:19:12.193
I've been waiting all night
To dance with you

01:19:12.311 --> 01:19:14.397
(Cheering)

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.445
I would like to introduce you to Julie

01:19:21.602 --> 01:19:25.561
who has worked non-stop
to organise this event.

01:19:25.685 --> 01:19:29.029
- Here's Julie to give out some prizes.
- Carole's doing the announcing.

01:19:29.061 --> 01:19:31.028
And Carole's going to do some...
Carole!

01:19:31.144 --> 01:19:34.106
I'd like to introduce you to Carole
as well then in that case.

01:19:34.811 --> 01:19:37.654
Carole is one
of our local neighbourhood councillors

01:19:37.768 --> 01:19:41.147
and she was one of the judges today
in the competition and...

01:19:41.268 --> 01:19:43.272
Well, I've lost the plot
of who's gonna speak now,

01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:46.272
so I'll get out the way
and leave you to these two.

01:19:46.810 --> 01:19:48.895
(Cheering)

01:19:52.976 --> 01:19:54.896
(Cheering)

01:20:05.434 --> 01:20:08.065
Erm... hi, everybody.

01:20:08.184 --> 01:20:13.352
This is the really wonderful
inaugural party in London Road.

01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:16.106
After, er, judging the best gardens

01:20:16.225 --> 01:20:19.152
and it really, really was difficult
choosing winners.

01:20:19.267 --> 01:20:23.569
And Julie must just be
The hanging basket queen of London Road

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:28.021
Anyway, it was a real pleasure today
Really good fun

01:20:28.849 --> 01:20:31.481
And so many people
Have made such a great effort

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.024
To make London Road look beauteous

01:20:35.141 --> 01:20:37.310
We're going to do the best front garden

01:20:37.433 --> 01:20:42.565
And we pick as the runner-up
As the winner, this garden

01:20:42.682 --> 01:20:45.065
Where it was very difficult

01:20:45.182 --> 01:20:50.017
it was a real challenge
To make this front garden beautiful

01:20:50.058 --> 01:20:53.566
Because basically it's all parking

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.069
(WWW)

01:20:55.099 --> 01:20:57.682
Er, it looks absolutely lovely

01:20:57.807 --> 01:20:59.775
And once you look round the cars

01:20:59.807 --> 01:21:02.024
Fantastic

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:04.606
Terry and June

01:21:05.765 --> 01:21:08.313
Come to the front, come to the front

01:21:08.349 --> 01:21:11.145
- Well done, Tel
- Well done

01:21:11.931 --> 01:21:15.439
Really, really wonderful effort

01:21:15.556 --> 01:21:17.026
Well done

01:21:17.057 --> 01:21:21.109
Look at me, please
Everyone, smile

01:21:23.431 --> 01:21:27.437
Look at me, please
Everyone, smile

01:21:27.598 --> 01:21:29.565
(Camera shutter clicks)

01:21:29.598 --> 01:21:32.442
Yeah, we have...
We have official photographers

01:21:32.598 --> 01:21:34.067
We have Jessica

01:21:34.181 --> 01:21:35.733
We're gonna have an exhibition
An' everything

01:21:35.764 --> 01:21:37.897
- No, we're not
- We are, we are

01:21:38.014 --> 01:21:39.056
(WWW)

01:21:39.181 --> 01:21:41.942
- Thank you
- OK

01:21:42.597 --> 01:21:48.724
Now there is the absolute winner

01:21:49.097 --> 01:21:51.515
The absolute winner

01:21:52.347 --> 01:21:55.025
And it is

01:21:55.139 --> 01:21:58.433
With the very best garden I do believe

01:21:59.972 --> 01:22:02.140
And it is

01:22:02.263 --> 01:22:05.273
Dodge, yes, it's Dodge

01:22:05.388 --> 01:22:07.640
(Cheering)

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:08.889
Oh, well done

01:22:09.013 --> 01:22:10.933
Look at me, please

01:22:11.054 --> 01:22:12.856
(Cheering)

01:22:12.888 --> 01:22:14.523
Look at me, please

01:22:14.638 --> 01:22:17.482
Look at me, please
Everyone, smile

01:22:17.638 --> 01:22:22.141
Everyone, smile
Everyone, smile

01:22:22.179 --> 01:22:25.639
I think this is absolutely fantastic

01:22:25.678 --> 01:22:28.689
So many people here tonight

01:22:28.804 --> 01:22:30.723
I haven't counted you all

01:22:31.345 --> 01:22:33.514
Seeing everybody have a great time

01:22:33.553 --> 01:22:35.722
Seeing everybody have a great time

01:22:35.845 --> 01:22:38.974
That's what it's all about
That's what it's all about

01:22:39.845 --> 01:22:42.061
I would like to congratulate

01:22:43.095 --> 01:22:47.183
Everyone that's really worked hard
On the gardens

01:22:49.344 --> 01:22:51.513
Even the people that haven't won

01:22:52.469 --> 01:22:56.262
It doesn't matter, it's...
It doesn't matter

01:22:57.511 --> 01:23:01.469
It's sharing their gardens
With everyone else

01:23:01.928 --> 01:23:06.064
It's sharing their gardens
With everyone else

01:23:06.885 --> 01:23:08.687
And really working hard

01:23:08.802 --> 01:23:11.599
And making London Road
What London Road is

01:23:11.718 --> 01:23:13.687
A fantastic road

01:23:13.802 --> 01:23:18.057
Look at me, please
Look at me, please

01:23:18.177 --> 01:23:22.052
- A fantastic road
- Look at me, please

01:23:22.093 --> 01:23:24.061
Everyone, smile...

01:23:24.176 --> 01:23:25.895
(Laughter and applause)

01:23:25.926 --> 01:23:27.312
(Camera shutter clicks)

01:23:30.551 --> 01:23:31.937
- You all right?
- Yes.

01:23:32.051 --> 01:23:33.805
I'd just like to point out as well

01:23:33.926 --> 01:23:38.181
It does seem that God
ls smiling on London Road

01:23:38.218 --> 01:23:41.144
Cos if you'd you seen
The weather forecast for today

01:23:41.259 --> 01:23:43.345
Well, look at it now

01:23:44.676 --> 01:23:46.761
Well, look at it now

01:23:47.717 --> 01:23:49.637
Well, look at it now

01:23:49.759 --> 01:23:56.727
(Residents) Well, look at it now

01:23:56.758 --> 01:24:05.102
Well, look at it now

01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:06.509
(Interviewer) And if I ask something
that you don't wanna ans...

01:25:06.631 --> 01:25:08.515
then that's fine, just tell me to...

01:25:08.631 --> 01:25:10.599
Christina said you'll tell me
to shut up anyway.

01:25:10.631 --> 01:25:12.515
(WWW)

01:25:12.673 --> 01:25:18.800
So, erm, I know, erm, what you're all,
you know, involved in work-wise.

01:25:18.839 --> 01:25:21.221
(Prostitute) Used to be.
We've all stopped.

01:25:21.339 --> 01:25:24.184
- We've all stopped working now.
- (Interviewer) OK.

01:25:24.297 --> 01:25:27.426
(Prostitute 2) Because of the murders
we've all stopped.

01:25:27.547 --> 01:25:32.133
(Prostitute 3) That's why we all stopped.
I stopped like a month before the murders.

01:25:32.255 --> 01:25:36.592
(Prostitute) We've got regulars
that phone and we see, you know.

01:25:36.630 --> 01:25:39.841
(Prostitute 2) Won't work the street,
but we've got a few regulars.

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:44.597
Ever since the murders took place, like,
there's no point going down there for one

01:25:44.713 --> 01:25:49.678
because all the cars get stopped
and you just get arrested all the time.

01:25:49.796 --> 01:25:53.139
(Prostitute 3) They weren't nicking us.
They were nicking the men.

01:25:53.171 --> 01:25:56.964
(Prostitute 2) I wanna get myself clean.

01:25:57.088 --> 01:26:01.045
If I could do anything, you know, like,
I'd get myself clean for them almost.

01:26:07.296 --> 01:26:12.095
(Ron) I got up and all I could see
were police cars going up the road.

01:26:12.129 --> 01:26:15.506
And, of course, you know, like,
we knew, obviously, it was in charge.

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:18.550
- Something to do with these poor girls.
- (Interviewer) Yeah.

01:26:18.586 --> 01:26:22.344
(Ron) But erm... And that's
when it all started. it all kicked off.

01:26:22.504 --> 01:26:25.597
(Girl) You think it could be him.
(Girl 2) Yeah.

01:26:25.711 --> 01:26:28.129
(Girl) That he could be amongst us

01:26:28.252 --> 01:26:31.215
and walking around with us every day
and we don't know.

01:26:31.336 --> 01:26:35.175
Like, anyone. It could anyone in here,
which has now really soared me.

01:26:35.211 --> 01:26:37.972
Now I'm thinking about it,
I'm just gonna, like, cry!

01:26:38.086 --> 01:26:39.721
(WWW)

01:26:39.836 --> 01:26:43.593
(Female reporter) This was the third time
Steve Wright has appeared in court,

01:26:43.627 --> 01:26:46.673
but it's the first time
that he's formally entered a plea.

01:26:46.794 --> 01:26:50.670
He arrived here at Ipswich Crown Court
shortly after nine o'clock this morning,

01:26:50.710 --> 01:26:54.052
but it wasn't until two o'clock
this afternoon that he stood up,

01:26:54.210 --> 01:26:57.055
dressed in a black suit,
white shirt and blue tie,

01:26:57.169 --> 01:27:01.340
and spoke clearly and confidently
when he was asked how he would plea

01:27:01.501 --> 01:27:03.719
to each of the five counts of murder.

01:27:03.835 --> 01:27:05.754
They were read out in this order...

01:27:06.793 --> 01:27:08.761
(Woman 5)
I've been here since about half-nine.

01:27:08.793 --> 01:27:12.965
I just saw him come along, like,
with the police, sirens and that.

01:27:13.084 --> 01:27:17.718
They were... you know...
None of the photographers caught him.

01:27:17.834 --> 01:27:20.714
Caught any photos of him
or anything but...

01:27:20.835 --> 01:27:23.631
Just waiting to get a glimpse, really.

01:27:23.667 --> 01:27:25.800
(Woman 6)

01:27:25.917 --> 01:27:27.755

as far as I'm, well, as far as I'm aware,

01:27:35.334 --> 01:27:38.130
about the only person
that has actually come down here

01:27:38.292 --> 01:27:40.544
and asked the residents how they feel.

01:27:42.625 --> 01:27:45.256
(JuHe)
I think this is absolutely fantastic.

01:27:45.292 --> 01:27:47.875

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.588
I haven't counted you all.

01:27:49.709 --> 01:27:52.968
Seeing everybody have a great time,
that's what it's all about.

with everyone else and really working hard

and making London Road
what London Road is -

01:28:09.499 --> 01:28:11.300
