00:11.888 --> 00:13.431
I think
I'm losing my mind.

00:13.598 --> 00:15.225
Hello, Shadow.

00:16.267 --> 00:17.936
There are bigger sacrifices

00:18.103 --> 00:19.896
one might be asked to make

00:20.063 --> 00:22.023
than going a little mad.

00:23.733 --> 00:25.193
What's in Chicago?

00:25.360 --> 00:26.903
The hammer.

00:27.946 --> 00:32.283
If I lose, I will go with Votan
and do what he asks...

00:33.326 --> 00:34.661
And if you win?

00:34.828 --> 00:37.539
I get to knock
your brains out with my hammer.

02:54.509 --> 02:56.469
Right there.

02:56.636 --> 02:58.221
OK.

03:02.517 --> 03:04.686
Mmm!

03:06.020 --> 03:07.605
Mmm. Perfect.

03:07.772 --> 03:09.357
It's too good for them.

03:09.524 --> 03:13.194
Eight grandchildren,
each one smart as a table.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.405
Assaf with his music.

03:15.572 --> 03:17.824
He sounds like you. Yeah.

03:17.991 --> 03:21.703
No, it's too early
to fry the onions.

03:21.870 --> 03:23.955
Assaf likes them crisp.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.083
No, no, it's not perfect.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.002
More cinnamon.

03:31.796 --> 03:36.384
Assaf? I told you
no come before 5:00!

03:36.551 --> 03:38.595
And no more bringing me
your laundry!

03:38.761 --> 03:40.805
I tell you I am done
being your maid...

03:43.016 --> 03:44.601
You are in wrong floor.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.811
Black people family
is upstairs.

03:48.980 --> 03:50.648
No mistake.

03:51.816 --> 03:55.153
You are to come with me,
Mrs Fadil.

03:56.195 --> 03:58.406
You have died, Mrs Fadil.

03:59.490 --> 04:02.702
And it is time for you
to come with me.

04:03.745 --> 04:05.455
I have company soon.

04:05.622 --> 04:08.207
If you are here to rob,
then rob.

04:08.374 --> 04:10.668
There's a television,
and I...I have a phone

04:10.835 --> 04:13.171
my grandson says
is also a camera.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.800
I wish I was but a thief.

04:17.967 --> 04:20.136
I am not.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.846
I am of Death.

04:22.889 --> 04:25.391
You are dead, Mrs Fadil.

04:30.521 --> 04:33.858
- That is me?
- That is you.

04:34.025 --> 04:36.736
Your family will come soon
and find you.

04:37.820 --> 04:39.697
They will do right
by your body

04:39.864 --> 04:41.449
and bury you as is proper.

04:41.616 --> 04:43.201
They will be sad for a time,

04:43.368 --> 04:45.620
then they will find
happiness again.

04:45.787 --> 04:47.956
Your Assaf will marry
in a year

04:48.122 --> 04:50.750
and name his first daughter
for you.

04:50.917 --> 04:53.211
A bullshit middle name?

04:53.378 --> 04:56.673
A bullshit middle name.

04:56.839 --> 04:59.509
This is how
they will find me?

05:09.185 --> 05:11.229
This is a Muslim home.

05:12.313 --> 05:15.566
Why does Anubis hold out
his hand for me?

05:15.733 --> 05:18.236
It is my thanks.

05:18.403 --> 05:21.531
You were once a girl
with your own Tita.

05:21.698 --> 05:24.575
Who taught you
the ways of Egypt old,

05:24.742 --> 05:27.495
of when the Nile
was full and flooding.

05:27.662 --> 05:31.332
She told you stories
of the Wolf and the Jackal,

05:31.499 --> 05:34.627
the Red Wind,
and of the Child of Bast.

05:34.794 --> 05:37.714
- I remember.
- You do.

05:37.880 --> 05:42.051
For that,
I bring you to the Scales.

05:42.218 --> 05:43.845
Come.

05:50.685 --> 05:53.604
My family will find me.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.900
They will not try it.

05:59.986 --> 06:01.821
You taste.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.954
It is perfect.

06:11.039 --> 06:13.207
68 years.

06:15.418 --> 06:17.420
It's not much for America,

06:17.587 --> 06:22.633
but...more than my Tita
ever prayed for.

06:23.676 --> 06:25.428
Come.

07:22.735 --> 07:24.278
This is not Queens.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.697
This is not
Queens.

07:57.270 --> 07:58.813
I was using that.

07:58.980 --> 08:01.357
We shall see
if you have used it well.

08:08.531 --> 08:12.285
I was unkind to the first boy
who loved me.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.663
I stole a doll once
from my cousin.

08:15.830 --> 08:17.415
I...

08:18.624 --> 08:21.002
I tried...my best.

08:24.714 --> 08:26.424
Your best is good.

08:41.606 --> 08:44.150
Each will take you
to the Duat.

08:44.317 --> 08:46.485
The Duat has many worlds.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.071
Choose.

08:50.114 --> 08:51.741
Which has my father?

08:52.825 --> 08:54.535
He beat me,

08:54.702 --> 08:57.788
and I would like
not to see his world.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.499
Choose.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.590
You are a kind boy.

09:07.757 --> 09:10.259
You choose for me?

09:30.029 --> 09:32.281
Are you sure I do this
with you?

09:33.532 --> 09:35.326
Follow the wrong god,

09:35.493 --> 09:37.578
I do not see my Tita again.

10:56.115 --> 10:57.658
Careful!

11:08.252 --> 11:10.087
The Buffalo is waning tonight.

11:14.550 --> 11:18.387
You're Zorya Poluch...ch...

11:18.554 --> 11:20.431
The sister that was sleeping.

11:20.598 --> 11:24.393
I'm Zorya Polunochnaya, yes.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.562
And you are called Shadow.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.612
What are you
looking at up there?

11:35.654 --> 11:37.073
I was looking at that.

11:37.239 --> 11:38.783
See?

11:38.949 --> 11:40.493
The Big Dipper?

11:40.659 --> 11:42.203
Odin's Wain, they call it.

11:42.370 --> 11:44.330
And the Great Bear.

11:44.497 --> 11:46.749
It is a...thing.

11:46.916 --> 11:49.919
It's not a god. Like a god.

11:50.086 --> 11:52.213
It's a bad thing.

11:52.380 --> 11:54.298
Chained up in those stars.

11:54.465 --> 11:57.468
If it escapes, it will eat
the whole of everything.

11:57.635 --> 11:59.303
So we watch the sky...

11:59.470 --> 12:03.724
..all day, all night,
the three sisters.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.937
If he escapes,
the thing in the stars,

12:08.104 --> 12:09.522
the world is over.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.232
Like that.

12:11.399 --> 12:13.734
And people believe that?

12:13.901 --> 12:16.237
A long time ago.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.949
You're not cold?

12:20.116 --> 12:22.076
Cold doesn't bother me.

12:23.119 --> 12:24.745
This time is my time.

12:25.788 --> 12:27.957
My sisters,
they're of their times.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.668
When is your time?

12:30.835 --> 12:32.336
Your birthday?

12:32.503 --> 12:35.339
No, I...I don't want
my fortune told.

12:35.506 --> 12:37.591
My fortunes are the best.

12:38.634 --> 12:40.845
Virgins have the advantage.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.558
And now we have something.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.438
Oh.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.189
No.

12:52.356 --> 12:53.816
You have nothing.

12:53.983 --> 12:57.236
You believe in nothing,
so you have nothing.

12:58.404 --> 13:00.698
You are on a path...

13:01.740 --> 13:03.784
..from nothing to everything.

13:05.411 --> 13:08.414
You had something recently.
You lost it.

13:08.581 --> 13:12.418
- My...my wife.
- Not your wife.

13:12.585 --> 13:15.880
Did you sell your head
to Czernobog?

13:18.674 --> 13:20.384
Yeah.

13:20.551 --> 13:22.553
You keep giving away your life.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.514
You don't much care
if you live or die, do you?

13:28.058 --> 13:30.394
The world's not
what I thought it would be.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.940
You'd rather die

13:35.107 --> 13:37.985
than live in a world
with bears in the sky.

13:42.364 --> 13:44.074
I can help you.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.577
First, you must do
something for me.

13:46.744 --> 13:50.080
What is it?
Gotta fight you? Play checkers?

13:50.247 --> 13:51.957
You have to kiss me.

13:53.042 --> 13:54.835
I have not ever been kissed.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.046
I don't know if I like it.

13:57.213 --> 13:58.631
We do this now.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.299
I...

14:07.890 --> 14:11.227
Kissing is...disgusting.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.771
But...but in a nice way.

14:13.938 --> 14:18.275
Like, uh, blue cheese or brandy.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.908
Take the moon.

14:27.368 --> 14:28.744
What?

14:28.911 --> 14:31.497
Just take it. Here.

14:41.006 --> 14:44.927
Don't lose this.
Don't give it away.

14:45.970 --> 14:47.638
You've been given
protection once.

14:47.805 --> 14:49.390
You had the sun itself.

14:49.557 --> 14:51.809
I can give you the moon.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.604
It's the daughter,
not the father.

14:56.647 --> 14:58.190
Now...

14:59.233 --> 15:00.859
..you wake up.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.625
Is not sunrise yet.

15:17.835 --> 15:20.004
Enjoy your time.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.839
How about another game?

15:23.382 --> 15:25.134
Same terms.

15:25.301 --> 15:27.011
How can be same?

15:27.177 --> 15:29.513
You want me to kill you twice?

15:31.473 --> 15:34.101
Right now you only have
one blow.

15:34.268 --> 15:36.604
One is all it takes.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.314
That is...

15:39.356 --> 15:40.899
..the art.

15:43.402 --> 15:45.237
How long has it been

15:45.404 --> 15:47.364
since you last swung
a killing hammer

15:47.531 --> 15:49.116
in the stockyards, though?

15:50.367 --> 15:52.786
It's gotta be, like,
what, 20 years?

15:52.953 --> 15:54.538
30?

15:55.664 --> 15:58.334
I think you got used to
the bolt gun.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.960
I think you got weak,

16:00.127 --> 16:02.755
and I don't think
you can kill me with one shot.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.507
You could just leave me
brain-damaged,

16:05.674 --> 16:09.595
a drooling piss bag reminder
that you got old.

16:10.638 --> 16:13.766
That's not gonna do
either of us any good, is it?

16:15.059 --> 16:17.728
If you're gonna
smash my brains in,

16:17.895 --> 16:19.938
I'd rather you finish the job.

16:26.612 --> 16:29.031
I win, you come with me
and Mr Wednesday,

16:29.198 --> 16:31.158
you'll still take your shot
when we're through.

16:31.325 --> 16:32.868
But you win...

16:34.286 --> 16:37.122
..and come sunrise,
you'll take your second swing,

16:37.289 --> 16:38.957
if you need it.

16:40.918 --> 16:43.337
No-one needs to know but me.

17:00.646 --> 17:03.357
OK. Another game.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.403
You are light, I'm dark.

17:21.625 --> 17:24.253
Enough visiting. Go to bed.

17:24.420 --> 17:26.547
I'm trying to.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.555
You deserve better than this.

17:34.722 --> 17:37.641
You no like it,
you sleep on floor.

17:37.808 --> 17:39.685
Is good enough for me.

17:39.852 --> 17:41.895
You only learned
to live with less.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.605
There is food,
there is roof.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.441
What more do you need?

17:45.607 --> 17:48.360
A court to adore you.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.239
In the old country,
you were draped with pearl,

17:52.406 --> 17:54.366
loved, feared, waited upon.

17:54.533 --> 17:56.326
Excess suits you.

17:57.411 --> 18:00.080
Things will be better again
soon enough.

18:04.543 --> 18:06.420
Ahh.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.088
Your turn.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.966
Ahh.

18:12.342 --> 18:13.719
Mm-hmm.

18:13.886 --> 18:15.387
Bye-bye.

18:16.555 --> 18:18.223
In old country,

18:18.390 --> 18:22.478
I opened the gate
for my father at dusk

18:22.644 --> 18:24.480
when he returned to us,

18:24.646 --> 18:28.192
then climb into
black satin sheet.

18:29.443 --> 18:33.071
Here, I tell pretty fortune
for dollars.

18:34.573 --> 18:37.242
Now, you've never told me mine.

18:42.998 --> 18:45.751
This thing you want to do,

18:45.918 --> 18:48.253
you will fail

18:48.420 --> 18:50.923
and they will win.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.636
That's only my fortune today.

19:01.600 --> 19:05.145
Come.
Walk with me, hmm?

19:05.312 --> 19:07.231
It will rain now.

19:07.397 --> 19:09.483
Boy, will it ever.

19:09.650 --> 19:13.028
Since when were you afraid
of getting a little wet, hmm?

19:25.999 --> 19:29.044
You're playing
the same game, old man.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.587
Only get to fool me once.

19:30.754 --> 19:32.005
Shut your mouth!

19:32.172 --> 19:34.508
Still so beautiful.

19:34.675 --> 19:37.219
I thought I told
the pretty lies.

19:37.386 --> 19:40.055
You want fortune
or you want truth?

19:40.222 --> 19:42.891
Oh, I want knowledge
over comfort,

19:43.058 --> 19:44.852
over all things, always.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.771
They will kill you this time.

19:47.938 --> 19:49.648
Ahh...

19:51.984 --> 19:55.821
Do you remember
when we were young?

19:57.030 --> 19:58.574
Barely.

20:00.826 --> 20:02.911
Well, let me remind you.

20:15.465 --> 20:17.843
What have you done?

20:41.783 --> 20:44.703
I can taste you on the rain.

20:48.749 --> 20:50.834
What else can I taste?

20:51.001 --> 20:53.003
War.

21:28.872 --> 21:30.290
Alright.

21:32.376 --> 21:37.130
I'll go with Votan
to his Wisconsin.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.095
Then I'm gonna kill you.

21:45.389 --> 21:47.265
Is good?

21:52.938 --> 21:54.439
Is good.

22:46.825 --> 22:49.661
Oh, you're up. This is good.

22:50.996 --> 22:53.999
- Storm died.
- No, it hasn't.

22:54.166 --> 22:56.418
We're gonna rob a bank.

22:56.585 --> 22:58.336
You want some coffee?

Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Fuck!

30:15.148 --> 30:16.774
Oh.

30:17.901 --> 30:21.070
Been driving this Allah-forsaken taxi
for 30 hours.

30:21.237 --> 30:23.281
It's too much.

30:24.324 --> 30:26.201
I spent the day
waiting to see a man

30:26.367 --> 30:27.827
who will not see me.

30:27.994 --> 30:30.371
My brother-in-law hates me.

30:30.538 --> 30:32.290
I have been in America
for a week,

30:32.457 --> 30:34.459
and it has done nothing
but eat my money.

30:34.626 --> 30:36.252
- I sell nothing.
- Hmm.

30:36.419 --> 30:37.921
What do you sell?

30:38.087 --> 30:41.674
Worthless gewgaws
and baubles

30:41.841 --> 30:43.468
and tourist trinkets.

30:43.635 --> 30:46.429
It's horrible, cheap,

30:46.596 --> 30:49.349
foolish, ugly shit.

30:51.184 --> 30:53.102
- You try and sell shit?
- I sell shit, yeah.

30:53.269 --> 30:55.230
And they will not buy it?

30:55.396 --> 30:56.773
- No.
- Eh, strange.

30:56.940 --> 30:58.608
'Cause when you look
in the stores here,

30:58.775 --> 31:00.151
that's all they sell.

31:00.318 --> 31:01.819
Shit.

31:01.986 --> 31:03.446
Take Eighth Avenue.

31:03.613 --> 31:05.448
We'll go uptown that way.

32:04.799 --> 32:06.426
My grandmother...

32:07.677 --> 32:09.679
..once swore that
she had seen an ifrit,

32:09.846 --> 32:12.390
or perhaps a marid,

32:12.557 --> 32:15.310
late one evening,
on the edge of the desert.

32:16.853 --> 32:19.147
We all told her
it was just a sandstorm,

32:19.314 --> 32:22.984
a little wind,
but she had seen its face.

32:25.278 --> 32:29.490
And its eyes, like yours,
were burning flames.

32:31.117 --> 32:33.119
Grandmothers came here too.

32:34.579 --> 32:36.914
Are there many jinn in New York?

32:37.957 --> 32:39.542
No.

32:40.543 --> 32:42.086
There are angels.

32:43.755 --> 32:46.549
There are men
who Allah made from mud.

32:49.052 --> 32:51.429
Then there are
the people of the fire.

32:52.555 --> 32:53.765
The jinn.

32:53.931 --> 32:56.100
They know nothing
about my people here.

32:57.143 --> 32:59.354
They think all we do
is grant wishes.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.147
If I could grant a wish,

33:01.314 --> 33:03.232
do you think
I would be driving a cab?

33:03.399 --> 33:07.028
Once I had a man
shit in the back seat.

33:07.195 --> 33:09.781
I had to clean wet shit
from that seat.

33:09.947 --> 33:11.949
Tell me, is that right?

33:18.122 --> 33:19.707
That's not right.

34:05.253 --> 34:06.963
Keep the change.

34:22.729 --> 34:24.313
I'm in room 318.

34:28.025 --> 34:31.112
Going to 76th and Madison.

35:28.920 --> 35:31.005
I wish you can see what I see.

35:57.907 --> 36:00.326
I do not grant wishes.

36:03.913 --> 36:06.207
But you do.

39:47.386 --> 39:49.889
I do not grant wishes.

39:59.231 --> 40:01.525
Ah, this is the bank
I'll be robbing,

40:01.692 --> 40:03.277
so let's go say hello.

40:03.444 --> 40:05.488
Are you outta
your goddamn mind?

40:05.654 --> 40:07.531
- Have a little faith, son.
- Hell, no!

40:07.698 --> 40:10.618
How about faith in a higher power
wanting me to succeed?

40:10.785 --> 40:12.953
- Fuck, no.
- Oh, fuck, yes!

40:13.120 --> 40:14.872
You're my bodyguard, huh?

40:15.915 --> 40:17.708
That means you guard my body.

40:17.875 --> 40:19.543
Is that not right?

40:19.710 --> 40:21.837
Not when you're robbing a bank.

40:22.004 --> 40:23.881
At the moment,
my body is going to the bank.

40:24.048 --> 40:26.467
It's not robbing it.
Come on. Learn.

40:26.634 --> 40:28.636
- It'll be fun.
- OK, look.

40:28.803 --> 40:31.263
We had a compact
or whatever the fuck you called it.

40:31.430 --> 40:33.015
OK? I'm not doing
anything illegal.

40:33.182 --> 40:34.600
Oh, you're not.

40:34.767 --> 40:36.685
Well, apart from maybe
a little aiding and abetting,

40:36.852 --> 40:38.395
and, of course,
receiving stolen money.

40:38.562 --> 40:40.314
I'll tell you what,
at the end of this,

40:40.481 --> 40:43.192
you're gonna come out
smelling like a rose.

40:46.487 --> 40:47.988
Fuck.

40:48.155 --> 40:49.323
Fuck.

40:50.366 --> 40:52.201
Fuck!

40:56.747 --> 40:59.667
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where the deposit slips are?

40:59.834 --> 41:01.544
Right out the front door
on the wall.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.462
And if I needed
to make an overnight deposit?

41:03.629 --> 41:05.172
- Same forms.
- Thank you.

41:19.270 --> 41:22.106
Oh, you do not look happy.

41:22.273 --> 41:24.233
I am five days out of prison,

41:24.400 --> 41:26.318
you're fixing to put me
back in by six.

41:26.485 --> 41:28.946
Do not bleed before
you are wounded, huh?

41:29.113 --> 41:31.031
Would you like me to
get you a hot chocolate?

41:31.198 --> 41:33.242
Yeah, come on!
Let me buy you a hot cocoa.

41:35.911 --> 41:37.580
Jot that number down.

41:57.933 --> 42:00.102
Got you marshmallows
in your cocoa.

42:00.269 --> 42:01.645
You like marshmallows?

42:01.812 --> 42:03.522
Why are you talking to me
about marshmallows?

42:03.689 --> 42:05.316
Like I'm worried about
marshmallows.

42:05.482 --> 42:07.276
Yeah, I like marshmallows.

42:07.443 --> 42:08.944
What we need is snow.

42:09.111 --> 42:12.364
Hard, driving, irritating snow.

42:12.531 --> 42:14.283
I want you to think snow.

42:14.450 --> 42:17.620
Think snow. Think snow.

42:17.786 --> 42:20.206
- Snow?
- Snow. Yeah, snow.

42:20.372 --> 42:22.917
See those clouds
over there to the west?

42:23.083 --> 42:27.421
Concentrate on making those
bigger, darker.

42:27.588 --> 42:30.966
Think about dark skies
and driving winds

42:31.133 --> 42:32.760
coming down from the Arctic.

42:32.927 --> 42:35.471
- Think snow.
- OK.

42:35.638 --> 42:37.848
- And how's this gonna help?
- Might not do anything.

42:38.015 --> 42:40.601
But at least it will
concentrate your mind.

42:40.768 --> 42:43.270
Snow, snow.

42:50.110 --> 42:51.654
Snow.

43:02.122 --> 43:03.624
Snow.

43:05.125 --> 43:06.835
Snow.

43:17.346 --> 43:19.598
We're here.

43:19.765 --> 43:22.268
Well, I'm here.
You're somewhere else.

43:24.979 --> 43:27.314
Just thinking about snow.

43:36.657 --> 43:39.702
That woman thinks
Jesus suffered for her sins.

43:39.868 --> 43:41.245
They're her sins.

43:41.412 --> 43:43.622
Why should Jesus
do all the suffering?

43:45.040 --> 43:46.917
'Cause his dad
sacrificed his ass.

43:47.084 --> 43:48.460
Don't blame the parent.

43:48.627 --> 43:50.838
Plenty of suffering
and blame to go around,

43:51.005 --> 43:53.841
although that White Jesus, well,

43:54.008 --> 43:56.218
could stand
a little more suffering.

43:56.385 --> 43:59.054
He's doing very well
for himself these days.

44:00.931 --> 44:03.517
And how many colours
does Jesus come in?

44:03.684 --> 44:06.478
Why, you got your
White Jesuit-style Jesus.

44:06.645 --> 44:08.355
You got your
Black African Jesus.

44:08.522 --> 44:10.065
You got your Brown Mexican Jesus.

44:10.232 --> 44:12.151
You got your swarthy Greek Jesus.
You've got...

44:12.318 --> 44:14.528
Well, that's a...
That's a lot of Jesus.

44:16.613 --> 44:18.490
There's a lot of need
for Jesus,

44:18.657 --> 44:21.285
so there's a lot of Jesus.

44:22.369 --> 44:24.288
Now, the Mexican Jesus
came here

44:24.455 --> 44:26.332
the same way
a lot of Mexicans do.

44:26.498 --> 44:27.916
- Illegally.
- Oh!

44:28.083 --> 44:30.210
No, that's not being racial.
You can ask Him.

44:30.377 --> 44:32.004
He'll tell you.

44:32.171 --> 44:34.048
He waded across the Rio Grande,

44:34.214 --> 44:36.175
his back as wet
as the epithet suggests.

44:36.342 --> 44:38.469
- Next customer.
- Oh!

44:38.635 --> 44:40.054
Good afternoon.

44:40.220 --> 44:42.639
I want to insta-print
a couple of sets of business cards.

44:42.806 --> 44:46.393
And I may need your assistance
with printing some posters.

44:47.436 --> 44:49.355
Snow. Snow.

44:49.521 --> 44:51.357
Snow.

46:01.385 --> 46:03.178
I think that's enough.

46:04.471 --> 46:06.265
Enough what?

46:07.307 --> 46:08.892
Snow.

46:10.519 --> 46:12.646
Don't want to immobilise
the city.

46:33.584 --> 46:36.170
- I thought of snow.
- And it snowed.

46:36.336 --> 46:37.963
What do you know?

46:48.140 --> 46:49.683
I love this place.

46:49.850 --> 46:52.478
Food's not particularly good,
but the ambiance...

46:53.687 --> 46:55.063
..unmissable.

46:55.230 --> 46:56.982
Come on, eat up.

46:57.149 --> 46:59.359
Can't rob a bank
on an empty stomach.

46:59.526 --> 47:00.903
No, I'm not hungry.

47:01.069 --> 47:03.822
Who says you have
to be hungry to eat?

47:03.989 --> 47:05.824
Wasn't supposed to snow today.

47:06.950 --> 47:08.952
Wasn't even supposed to be cold.

47:10.787 --> 47:13.582
So, you're perfectly OK
believing

47:13.749 --> 47:16.001
that tiny people on television
can predict the weather,

47:16.168 --> 47:18.420
but you crinkle
with consternation

47:18.587 --> 47:20.797
at the mere suggestion
that you could make it snow.

47:20.964 --> 47:23.634
One of those things is science, OK?
The other is fantasy.

47:23.800 --> 47:26.428
You're talking about it
like it's apples and oranges.

47:26.595 --> 47:28.263
It's not apples
and oranges, OK?

47:28.430 --> 47:30.557
It's reality and fantasy.

47:30.724 --> 47:33.560
Oh, so that's how
the world works!

47:33.727 --> 47:35.479
It's either real
or it's fantasy.

47:35.646 --> 47:37.481
Yeah, that's how
the world works.

47:37.648 --> 47:39.650
Yeah, says the man
who hasn't seen it.

47:39.816 --> 47:43.070
Shadow, at best, you suffer
from a failure of imagination.

47:43.237 --> 47:44.905
We're gonna have to fix that.

47:45.072 --> 47:46.865
Uh-oh, look what
the goat dragged in.

47:47.032 --> 47:48.408
- Cat.
- Goat.

47:48.575 --> 47:50.285
Big, rank, stinking goat.

47:50.452 --> 47:51.954
Mad Sweeney,
you look like a man

47:52.120 --> 47:53.997
who's fallen on hard times
from a great height.

47:54.164 --> 47:55.958
Thought I wasn't gonna see you
until Wisconsin.

47:56.124 --> 47:57.668
I'll never make it to Wisconsin,

47:57.834 --> 47:59.545
not with the current state
of my luck.

47:59.711 --> 48:01.338
This cunt's got my coin.

48:02.548 --> 48:04.424
Give me my coin, cunt.

48:04.591 --> 48:08.053
- The coin you gave me?
- Witness. He has a point.

48:09.096 --> 48:10.639
I gave you the wrong coin.

48:10.806 --> 48:12.891
The one I gave you
was my lucky coin.

48:13.058 --> 48:16.562
Well, you can't afford to be
too careless with a lucky coin.

48:16.728 --> 48:18.772
Something like that,
you wanna hang on to.

48:18.939 --> 48:22.192
Tell you what, I'll give you
your lucky coin back

48:22.359 --> 48:25.028
when you tell me
how you plucked it out of thin air.

48:25.195 --> 48:26.905
I plucked it out of thin air

48:27.072 --> 48:30.075
is how I plucked it out of thin air,
ya bug-eatin' nonce.

48:31.493 --> 48:35.330
Now give me...my...coin.

48:35.497 --> 48:39.084
I threw it...away.

48:39.251 --> 48:43.297
Where...did you throw it...away?

48:45.632 --> 48:47.676
Eagle Point, Indiana.

48:50.053 --> 48:52.931
So, if you want
your lucky coin back,

48:53.098 --> 48:55.350
make your way
to Parkview Cemetery.

48:55.517 --> 48:57.436
There you will find
my wife's grave

48:57.603 --> 48:59.187
with your coin on top.

48:59.354 --> 49:01.023
Oh, you fucker.

49:02.691 --> 49:04.818
Suppose I'll just be one more
in a long line of men

49:04.985 --> 49:06.820
to climb on top
of your dead wife.

49:06.987 --> 49:08.655
Be nice.

49:10.490 --> 49:12.784
- I'll see you in Wisconsin.
- Yeah.

49:13.910 --> 49:16.330
Good luck,
Mad Sweeney.

49:16.496 --> 49:18.081
I'll see you back at the car.

49:18.248 --> 49:20.000
Just make sure
he doesn't steal it.

49:28.842 --> 49:30.761
Now, you're gonna do
a little light shopping

49:30.927 --> 49:32.304
at the grocery store.

49:32.471 --> 49:34.181
Pass a little time
at the phone booth.

49:34.348 --> 49:35.849
If anybody asks you
what you're doing,

49:36.016 --> 49:37.893
well, you're waiting for
a call from your girlfriend.

49:38.060 --> 49:39.311
Her car broke down.

49:39.478 --> 49:40.937
Here.

49:41.104 --> 49:44.441
- Who the fuck is this?
- You the fuck is this.

49:45.525 --> 49:48.070
"A. Haddock, Director of Security,
A1 Security Services."

49:48.236 --> 49:49.696
Yeah, that's you.

49:49.863 --> 49:51.365
But what's the 'A' stand for?

49:51.531 --> 49:54.451
Alberto? Alphonse? Augustine?

49:54.618 --> 49:56.203
Ambrose?
It's entirely up to you.

49:56.370 --> 49:58.538
'Asshole' is what I feel like.

49:58.705 --> 50:00.207
Nice to meet you, Asshole.

50:00.374 --> 50:02.084
I'm James O'Gorman.
Jimmy to my friends.

50:02.250 --> 50:04.044
I got a card too.

50:04.211 --> 50:07.172
OK. Let's get outta here.

50:07.339 --> 50:08.715
Huh? Alright.

50:10.425 --> 50:11.885
I'm gonna leave you
with one question.

50:12.052 --> 50:14.221
If at the end of this night
you do not end up in jail,

50:14.388 --> 50:16.098
will you believe in me?

50:17.557 --> 50:19.559
Don't answer that question.

51:16.950 --> 51:19.286
No. No, no, no, no, no.

51:21.663 --> 51:23.749
Fuck!

51:46.772 --> 51:48.148
A1 Security Services.

51:48.315 --> 51:50.192
<i>Can I speak to A. Haddock?</i>

51:50.358 --> 51:51.777
Uh, this is Andy Haddock.

51:51.943 --> 51:53.612
<i>Mr Haddock,
this is the Chicago Police.</i>

51:53.779 --> 51:55.363
<i>You've got a man
at the First River Bank</i>

51:55.530 --> 51:57.199
<i>on the corner
of Market and Second?</i>

51:57.365 --> 51:59.201
Uh...yeah.
That's...that's right, Officer.

51:59.367 --> 52:03.038
It...it should be James O'Gorman.
Is there a problem?

52:03.205 --> 52:04.414
<i>No problem, sir.</i>

52:04.581 --> 52:06.166
<i>Just wanted to make sure
everything's in order.</i>

52:06.333 --> 52:07.793
- Well, thank you.
<i>- We're just concerned.</i>

52:07.959 --> 52:09.628
<i>Because something like this
really ought to be handled</i>

52:09.795 --> 52:11.171
<i>by two personnel.</i>

52:11.338 --> 52:12.714
Oh, tell me about it!

52:12.881 --> 52:14.591
Better yet, you tell
those stingy bastards

52:14.758 --> 52:16.301
down at First River Bank
about it.

52:16.468 --> 52:18.303
I mean, these are my men
I'm putting on the line.

52:18.470 --> 52:19.805
You know, they're good men.

52:19.971 --> 52:24.434
You know, you sound like
a bright young man, Officer...?

52:24.601 --> 52:26.978
<i>- Myerson.</i>
- Officer Myerson.

52:28.063 --> 52:30.190
If you ever need
any extra weekend work,

52:30.357 --> 52:32.025
you just give us a call.

52:32.192 --> 52:33.735
- You got my card?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

52:33.902 --> 52:36.822
- Hang onto it. You call us.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

52:36.988 --> 52:38.865
<i>Have a good evening, sir.</i>

52:46.706 --> 52:48.917
So that's what you do
to make money.

52:49.084 --> 52:51.253
You believe in me now?

52:52.295 --> 52:53.880
I believe you exist.

52:54.047 --> 52:56.842
Oh, I think I deserve
a little more faith than that.

52:57.008 --> 52:58.468
Are you back in jail?

52:58.635 --> 53:00.554
All that whining
about going back to jail,

53:00.720 --> 53:02.347
and you haven't, have you?

53:02.514 --> 53:04.641
Not yet.

53:10.188 --> 53:12.691
This is
the only country in the world

53:12.858 --> 53:15.110
that wonders what it is.

53:15.277 --> 53:17.529
You've been to a lot of
other countries, have you?

53:17.696 --> 53:19.823
No. No, never, just this one.

53:20.907 --> 53:22.826
Just that the others
know what they are.

53:22.993 --> 53:26.162
I mean, no-one wonders
about the heart of Norway

53:26.329 --> 53:28.540
or goes searching
for the soul of Mozambique.

53:28.707 --> 53:30.542
Mozambique knows what it is.

53:30.709 --> 53:32.252
They all know what they are.

53:32.419 --> 53:33.879
Americans know who they are.

53:34.045 --> 53:35.422
They pretend they know.

53:35.589 --> 53:37.007
But it's still
just pretending.

53:37.173 --> 53:39.175
Like I'm pretending now.
Just like you.

53:39.342 --> 53:41.553
What am I pretending?

53:42.596 --> 53:47.475
You are pretending you cannot
believe in impossible things.

53:50.270 --> 53:54.149
Uh, I'd be genuinely deluded
if I believed that shit.

53:54.316 --> 53:56.443
If you are deluded,
I believe it's genuine.

53:56.610 --> 54:00.447
You don't strike me
as the disingenuous type.

54:19.549 --> 54:21.217
OK, let's go.

54:23.470 --> 54:25.931
Huh?

54:26.097 --> 54:28.224
Did I make snow?

54:29.643 --> 54:31.937
Did you make snow?

54:37.025 --> 54:39.903
Well, if you choose
to believe you made snow,

54:40.070 --> 54:43.156
then you get to live
the rest of your life believing

54:43.323 --> 54:46.451
that you can do things
that are impossible.

54:47.535 --> 54:49.454
Or you can believe
it's a delusion.

54:49.621 --> 54:51.706
No, see,
delusions feel real, OK?

54:51.873 --> 54:54.000
That's why it's a delusion.
None of this feels real.

54:54.167 --> 54:55.877
It feels like a dream.

54:56.920 --> 54:59.506
What a beautiful,
beautiful thing

54:59.673 --> 55:02.217
to be able to dream
when you're not asleep.

55:05.136 --> 55:06.805
I've...

55:06.972 --> 55:08.682
I've crossed enough paths

55:08.848 --> 55:11.267
to know that one in four people
are rock stupid.

55:11.434 --> 55:13.687
Even the smart ones have got
some kind of delusion

55:13.853 --> 55:17.023
they believe in,
whether it's gods or ghosts.

55:21.194 --> 55:23.029
Do you believe in love?

55:23.196 --> 55:25.323
Yeah, I believe the shit
out of love.

55:25.490 --> 55:27.158
Did you always?

55:28.576 --> 55:29.995
Not before Laura.

55:30.161 --> 55:32.372
So you didn't believe
till you did,

55:32.539 --> 55:35.083
and then the world changed
because you believed.

55:35.250 --> 55:38.586
Belief is only a product
of the company we keep

55:38.753 --> 55:40.964
and how easily we scare.

55:41.131 --> 55:42.882
And you do not scare easily.

55:43.049 --> 55:46.636
And my company is questionable.

55:46.803 --> 55:48.388
Always has been.

55:52.100 --> 55:56.271
The only thing that scares me
is being forgotten.

55:57.313 --> 55:59.733
I can survive most things,
but not that.

56:00.942 --> 56:03.987
Very best part
of memory is it's...

56:04.154 --> 56:06.072
..mostly about forgetting.

56:06.239 --> 56:09.951
We remember
what's important to us.

56:11.369 --> 56:13.288
I wonder what'll be
the first thing

56:13.455 --> 56:14.914
that drifts through your mind

56:15.081 --> 56:16.833
when you look back
on this evening?

56:18.293 --> 56:21.713
Snow, I bet.

56:46.905 --> 56:48.573
Room 55.

57:51.010 --> 57:52.554
