It's my way of saying that
we're friends,

09:27.953 --> 09:31.000
and it wouldn't hurt
you to drop a few!

09:32.287 --> 09:35.218
See? No wonder
I don't have any confidence.

09:35.359 --> 09:37.387
Come on. You can't
blame that on me.

09:37.445 --> 09:41.654
Why not? 15 years
of constant ridicule. I-I think

09:41.712 --> 09:43.997
our relationship
has become toxic.

09:44.396 --> 09:46.229
Uh, what are you saying?

09:47.747 --> 09:50.306
I think you and I need to spend
some time away from each other.

09:52.532 --> 09:55.966
Look, I... I can see
you're upset, but...

09:56.176 --> 09:59.748
I'm gonna need some
ground rules. I mean,

09:59.990 --> 10:02.835
while we're apart, can I see
other needy Indian men?

10:02.977 --> 10:04.710
Get out!

10:12.735 --> 10:14.030
What do you
think will make

10:14.088 --> 10:15.956
the wedding worse for Amy:

10:16.420 --> 10:20.057
a cake made with salt
instead of sugar...

10:21.087 --> 10:26.241
or a cake iced
with congealed gravy?

10:27.511 --> 10:28.902
That is a trick question.

10:28.960 --> 10:32.230
The answer is:
you as the groom.

10:34.388 --> 10:36.354
Neither of them
will be the actual cake.

10:36.422 --> 10:38.357
I'm just using it
as a bargaining chip

10:38.750 --> 10:42.021
to get Amy to agree to the whole
wedding party getting rings

10:42.079 --> 10:46.082
and us getting one ring
to rule them all.

10:47.594 --> 10:51.444
I forget, which mental hospital
are you guys registered at?

10:52.057 --> 10:53.064
Hello.

10:53.146 --> 10:54.479
- Hello. - Hello.
- Hello.

10:57.567 --> 10:58.768
Really?

10:58.883 --> 11:00.430
You're not
gonna sit here?

11:00.568 --> 11:03.187
I'll sit there as
soon as you leave.

11:03.744 --> 11:05.092
You're still
on this?

11:05.150 --> 11:06.402
I said sorry.

11:06.545 --> 11:09.987
Well, "sorry" doesn't make up
for years of emotional abuse.

11:10.106 --> 11:12.773
(sighs)
Well, what's it gonna take?

11:12.847 --> 11:15.022
You want half my sandwich?

11:17.767 --> 11:19.268
What is going on?

11:19.358 --> 11:23.028
Raj is trying to blame me
for his pathetic life.

11:23.181 --> 11:24.714
His life isn't pathetic.

11:24.781 --> 11:27.584
He's got that whole table
to himself.

11:29.258 --> 11:31.777
One of us should go sit with Raj
so he's not alone.

11:31.835 --> 11:34.366
But I'm not done telling you
about my wedding revenge plans.

11:34.443 --> 11:35.746
You're right. Go on.

11:35.804 --> 11:37.179
Okay, well, first,
I'm going to try

11:37.237 --> 11:40.340
to get Amy to trade with me
for hors d'oeuvres...

11:41.178 --> 11:42.416
♪♪

11:43.044 --> 11:44.925
Oh, good,
you're here.

11:45.086 --> 11:47.555
I've decided
on our centerpieces.

11:47.659 --> 11:51.461
I just hope your family
isn't allergic to asbestos.

11:51.860 --> 11:53.464
Sheldon, please stop.

11:53.647 --> 11:55.888
If we keep doing this,
we're gonna end up with a wedding

11:55.945 --> 11:58.283
that neither one of us
will enjoy.

11:58.875 --> 12:00.933
Are you saying
you don't want to get married?

12:01.151 --> 12:02.879
No, of course I do.

12:02.937 --> 12:06.405
But that seems to be
the one thing we can agree on.

12:06.623 --> 12:09.728
Maybe we should just
get married at City Hall

12:09.786 --> 12:12.087
and forget
about everything else.

12:12.913 --> 12:15.526
City Hall, hmm.

12:15.980 --> 12:18.387
I do like metal detectors

12:19.348 --> 12:22.402
and the sound of
permits being denied.

12:22.866 --> 12:24.135
Right.

12:24.209 --> 12:26.406
And if we're not enjoying
planning this wedding,

12:26.464 --> 12:27.767
then what's the point?

12:27.946 --> 12:29.934
Well, historically,
a wedding was to let

12:29.992 --> 12:32.232
other potential suitors know
that we're unavailable.

12:32.415 --> 12:34.399
But I think matching
T-shirts that say

12:34.457 --> 12:37.291
"Hands off the merchandise"
accomplish the same thing.

12:39.038 --> 12:42.469
So let's pick a day
and just go do it.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.649
How 'bout tomorrow?

12:48.089 --> 12:49.242
R-Really?

12:49.309 --> 12:50.701
That soon?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.067
Why wait?

12:52.198 --> 12:54.265
I mean, it's not that I think
we're living in sin,

12:54.323 --> 12:56.947
but I do like the idea
that our next act of intimacy

12:57.005 --> 12:59.035
will be a legal requirement.

13:00.856 --> 13:04.184
Tomorrow we'll go downtown
and get married.

13:04.247 --> 13:07.640
Or we could go to
Beverly Hills City Hall

13:07.715 --> 13:10.428
if you want
a destination wedding.

13:14.592 --> 13:16.268
Hey. You look
good today.

13:16.644 --> 13:18.660
What happened? What's wrong?

13:19.963 --> 13:21.750
Just tell me. I can take it.

13:22.242 --> 13:24.564
Nothing. I felt bad
about being mean to you,

13:24.622 --> 13:26.057
so I'm being nice.

13:26.131 --> 13:27.138
Oh, okay.

13:27.196 --> 13:28.298
Sorry. I wasn't ready for it.

13:28.355 --> 13:29.416
Try again.

13:29.529 --> 13:30.632
You look handsome.

13:30.807 --> 13:32.753
Nope, still freaking me out.

Hello, friends!
PENNY AND LEONARD: Hey.

13:35.808 --> 13:37.230
Hey, what's going on
with your hair?

13:37.288 --> 13:39.924
Uh, nothing. I just decided
to stop straightening it.

13:40.087 --> 13:43.606
Wait, so you were making your
hair look like that on purpose?

13:44.434 --> 13:47.859
When I first moved to America,
I wanted to fit in.

13:47.926 --> 13:49.240
And Howard's hair was straight,

13:49.335 --> 13:50.520
and he was the coolest person
I knew.

13:50.577 --> 13:53.339
Then you never saw
any other people?

13:54.132 --> 13:55.891
You know what, I-I don't want
to talk about Howard.

13:55.948 --> 13:58.448
I came here to celebrate!

13:58.543 --> 14:00.855
Yeah. I went back
to the planetarium and told them

14:00.913 --> 14:03.738
they were making a huge mistake,
that I'd be perfect for the job.

14:03.807 --> 14:05.862
I was... I was charming,
I was confident.

14:05.920 --> 14:06.954
And they gave it to me.

14:07.021 --> 14:08.025
Wow.
(chuckles)

14:08.083 --> 14:09.085
- That's amazing!
- Yeah, plus,

14:09.142 --> 14:10.182
it turns out the guy they hired

14:10.239 --> 14:12.653
got busted
at a sketchy massage parlor.

14:14.152 --> 14:15.950
Oh, so happy ending for you!

14:16.018 --> 14:17.953
Oh, and for him.

14:19.493 --> 14:20.972
Yeah, I was on my way
to tell Howard,

14:21.030 --> 14:22.684
and then I remembered
I wasn't speaking to him,

14:22.741 --> 14:24.077
so I came over here.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.323
Mm, don't you think it's time
you two made up?

14:26.381 --> 14:27.388
No.

14:27.446 --> 14:29.801
No, actually.
I don't need his negative energy

14:29.868 --> 14:31.000
in my life right now.

14:31.269 --> 14:33.128
Standing up to him
was-was hard,

14:33.216 --> 14:35.813
but it made me realize
that I can do anything.

14:35.994 --> 14:39.095
And, yeah, it's a little sad,
but, you know,

14:39.307 --> 14:41.440

I never thought
I'd want to marry anyone.

So the fact that I found you
is astonishing.

17:35.351 --> 17:38.257

dark matter,

for dark matter.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.966

than dark matter.

17:45.962 --> 17:47.743

Sheldon.

17:47.811 --> 17:52.282
Plus, plus, you interact
with light, so I can see you.

17:52.470 --> 17:55.071
And, also, you don't account
for the missing mass

17:55.129 --> 17:57.330
- in the universe. Oh, and...
- Okay, I think

17:57.388 --> 17:59.977
you're getting caught up on the
ways I'm not like dark matter.

18:00.306 --> 18:01.742
Right. Sorry.

18:01.885 --> 18:05.522
But when you make
a discovery like this,

18:05.912 --> 18:07.995
you don't just take it down

cultural appropriation.

18:16.640 --> 18:18.895
- It is.
- Okay, so not smoke signals.

to do this right.

20:17.301 --> 20:18.769
Come on. Come say hi.

20:19.970 --> 20:21.537
Okay.

20:22.411 --> 20:26.275
Dr. Koothrappali, I just wanted
to tell you that was amazing.

20:26.406 --> 20:28.999
- Uh, counterpoint...
- To the car.

20:30.249 --> 20:31.535
Can I ask you
a question?

20:31.593 --> 20:33.971
Of course you can.
Ooh, that went well.

20:34.029 --> 20:35.618
Ask me another.

20:36.756 --> 20:39.123
I think
I'm just gonna go.

20:40.887 --> 20:43.364
If there is life beneath
the surface of these planets,

20:43.481 --> 20:45.136
how would we even detect it?

20:45.243 --> 20:47.546
Uh, that's
a complicated question.

20:47.733 --> 20:49.307
Let me start with a simpler one.

20:49.467 --> 20:50.960
Can I buy you a coffee?

20:51.794 --> 20:54.123
A-Also a complicated question.
(chuckles nervously)

20:54.377 --> 20:56.707
Because I want to say yes,
but if I drink coffee this late,

20:56.774 --> 20:57.912
then I'll be up all night.

20:57.970 --> 21:00.306
Decaf, genius.
(clears throat)

21:00.591 --> 21:01.979
I would love to.

21:02.046 --> 21:04.355
