WEBVTT

00:10.427 --> 00:11.929
Oh, my head!

00:12.054 --> 00:15.103
Time travel without a capsule,
that's a killer.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.863
Still, at least we made it.

00:20.938 --> 00:23.908
Earth, 21st century by the looks of it.

00:24.024 --> 00:27.654
- Talk about lucky.
- That wasn't luck. That was me.

00:29.112 --> 00:32.537
Hold it still!
Don't move, hold it still...

00:32.616 --> 00:35.460
I'm telling you, it's broken,
it hasn't worked for years...

00:35.577 --> 00:38.877
That's because you didn't have me!
Martha, grab hold.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.583
NOW!

00:42.459 --> 00:44.962
The moral is, if you're gonna
get stuck at the end of the universe,

00:45.045 --> 00:47.764
get stuck with an ex-Time Agent
and his vortex manipulator.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.762
But this Master bloke,
he's got the Tardis.

00:49.841 --> 00:53.562
- He could be anywhere in time and space.
- No. He's here. Trust me.

00:53.637 --> 00:54.729
Who is he anyway?

00:54.805 --> 00:56.885
And that voice at the end,
that wasn't the Professor.

00:56.932 --> 00:59.230
If the Master's a Time Lord,
then he must've regenerated.

00:59.309 --> 01:02.153
- What does that mean?
- It means he's changed his face.

01:02.229 --> 01:05.108
Voice, body, everything, new man.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.491
Then how are we gonna find him?

01:12.573 --> 01:15.668
I'll know him. The moment I see him.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.411
Time Lords always do.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.623
But hold on, if he could be anyone...

01:20.706 --> 01:25.428
We missed the election.
But it can't be...

01:25.502 --> 01:28.051
Mr Saxon has returned from the Palace,

01:28.171 --> 01:32.142
and is greeting the crowds
inside Saxon Headquarters.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.096
I said I knew that voice.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.680
When he spoke, inside the Tardis,

01:36.763 --> 01:40.017
I've heard that voice hundreds of times.
I've seen him, we all have.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.728
That was the voice of Harold Saxon.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.572
That's him. He's Prime Minister.

01:47.649 --> 01:50.698
The Master is Prime Minister
of Great Britain.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.540
The Master and his wife?

01:55.657 --> 01:58.706
This country has been sick.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.670
This country needs healing.

02:00.746 --> 02:03.295
This country needs medicine.

02:03.415 --> 02:05.588
In fad; I'd go so far as to say,

02:05.709 --> 02:09.714
that what this country
really needs right now

02:09.795 --> 02:11.924
is a Doctor.

02:52.047 --> 02:54.470
- Finance report, sir.
- Military protocol, sir.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.434
- EC directive, sir.
- Annual budget, sir.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.387
Policy recommendations.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.395
I'm so proud of you, Harry.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.229
Bless.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.740
Sir, if you don't mind me asking.

03:10.816 --> 03:14.821
I'm sorry, but it's all a bit new,
what exactly do you want me to do?

03:14.945 --> 03:17.949
- Oh, yes, what was it...
- Tish, Letitia Jones.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.283
Tish.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.209
Well then, Tish.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.124
You just stand there and look gorgeous.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.507
A glorious day. Downing Street rebuilt.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.844
The Cabinet in session.

03:36.133 --> 03:39.307
Let the work of government begin.

03:44.558 --> 03:48.984
Oh, go on, crack a smile.
It's funny, isn't it?

03:49.104 --> 03:52.734
Albert? Funny? No? Little bit?

03:52.816 --> 03:55.114
Very funny, sir.

03:55.193 --> 03:59.164
But if we could get down to business,
there is the matter of policy,

03:59.239 --> 04:01.662
- of which we have very little...
- No, no, no, no.

04:01.742 --> 04:05.087
Before we start all that,
I just want to say...

04:07.789 --> 04:11.089
Thank you. Thank you one and all.

04:11.168 --> 04:16.048
You ugly fat-faced
bunch of wet, snivelling traitors.

04:16.173 --> 04:19.302
Yes, quite, very funny, but I...

04:19.384 --> 04:22.809
No, no, that wasn't funny.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.438
You see, I'm not making
myself very clear,

04:27.517 --> 04:29.986
funny is like this...

04:31.980 --> 04:34.699
Not funny is like this...

04:34.816 --> 04:38.662
And right now, I'm not like...
I'm like...

04:39.905 --> 04:43.580
Because you are traitors. Yes, you are!

04:43.658 --> 04:46.662
As soon as you saw the vote
swinging my way,

04:46.745 --> 04:52.252
you abandoned your parties and you
jumped on the Saxon bandwagon. So...

04:54.669 --> 04:57.798
This is your reward.

05:00.717 --> 05:05.097
Excuse me, Prime Minister, do you
mind my asking, what is that?

05:05.222 --> 05:07.395
- A gas mask.
- I beg your pardon?

05:08.683 --> 05:10.651
It's a gas mask.

05:10.727 --> 05:14.777
Yes, but why are you wearing it?

05:14.898 --> 05:18.027
- Oh, because of the gas.
- I'm sorry?

05:18.109 --> 05:20.988
- Because of the gas.
- What gas?

05:22.030 --> 05:23.748
This gas.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.676
You're insane.

05:51.810 --> 05:52.857
Home!

05:52.936 --> 05:54.859
What you got?
Computer, laptop, anything.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.940
Who are you phoning?
You can't tell anyone we're here!

05:57.023 --> 05:58.445
Just some friends of mine
but there's no reply.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.902
Here you go. Any good?

05:59.985 --> 06:02.784
I'll show you the Saxon websites,
he's been around for ages.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.574
That's so weird,
'cause the day after the election,

06:05.657 --> 06:07.705
that's only four days after I met you.

06:07.784 --> 06:11.505
We went flying all round the universe
while he was here all the time.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.459
- You gonna tell us who he is?
- He's a Time Lord.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.340
What about the rest of it?
I mean, who'd call himself "the Master"?

06:17.419 --> 06:22.676
That's all you need to know.
Come on, show me Harold Saxon.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.725
Martha, where are you?
I've got this new job!

06:24.801 --> 06:27.395
You won't believe it, it's weird.
They phoned me up out of the blue...

06:27.470 --> 06:29.222
Oh, like it matters!

06:29.306 --> 06:33.527
- I'm sorry, but you're not allowed in...
- "Harold Saxon, a modern Churchill."

06:33.602 --> 06:36.196
It's the definitive think-piece
on the great man himself.

06:36.313 --> 06:37.986
Come on, sweetheart,
you must've read it!

06:38.064 --> 06:40.032
Urn, not really. Sorry, I'm new.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.032
Mr Saxon does like a pretty face.
But I'm here to see Mrs Saxon.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.746
You can't just go barging in...

06:44.821 --> 06:48.496
Mrs Saxon, Vivien Rook, Sunday Mirror.
You've heard of me.

06:48.617 --> 06:51.211
Can't I just have an hour to myself?
It's been a hell of a day.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.489
Strike while the iron's hot,
that's what I say, Lucy...

06:53.496 --> 06:55.794
I can call you Lucy, can't I?

06:55.874 --> 06:58.878
Now, everyone's talking
about Harold Saxon,

06:58.960 --> 07:02.840
but I thought, what about the wife?
All I need is 20 minutes.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.017
Oh, I think maybe we should wait...

07:05.091 --> 07:08.766
The headline's waiting to print,
"The Power Behind The Throne".

07:09.846 --> 07:11.689
- Really?
- Britain's First Lady.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.233
- Gosh.
- Front page.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.603
Oh! Well...

07:15.685 --> 07:18.734
I suppose... Oh, go on then, 20 minutes.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.107
Excellent!

07:20.190 --> 07:23.740
Thank you. Go, go...
What was it... Tish?

07:23.860 --> 07:26.704
Now you can leave us alone.

07:26.821 --> 07:31.167
- No, but I'm supposed to sit in.
- No, no. It's only a profile piece.

07:31.242 --> 07:37.340
You know, hair and clothes and nonsense.
There's a good girl, out you go.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.879
That's it.

07:40.210 --> 07:44.181
Mrs Saxon, I have reason to believe

07:45.382 --> 07:48.386
that you're in very great danger.
All of us, in fact.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.891
Not just the country,
but the whole world.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.769
No, I beg of you. Hear me out.

07:52.889 --> 07:57.565
- What are you talking about?
- Your husband is not who he says he is.

07:57.644 --> 08:01.899
I'm sorry, but it's a lie.
Everything's a lie.

08:06.069 --> 08:09.915
I'm voting Saxon.
He can tick my box any day!

08:10.031 --> 08:13.160
Vote Saxon! Go Harry!

08:13.576 --> 08:16.830
I think Mr Saxon is exactly what
this country needs.

08:16.913 --> 08:20.759
He '5 a very fine man.
And he's handsome, too.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.429
Former Minister of Defence,
first came to prominence

08:24.546 --> 08:27.015
when he shot down
the Racnoss on Christmas Eve.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.434
- Nice work by the way.
- Oh, thanks.

08:29.592 --> 08:33.813
But he goes back years, he's famous,
everyone knows the story. Look.

08:34.972 --> 08:39.352
Cambridge University, rugby Blue,
won the athletics thing, wrote a novel,

08:39.436 --> 08:41.813
went into business,
marriage, everything.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.737
He's got a whole life.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.535
All of it, the school days, his degree,

08:47.610 --> 08:50.454
even his mother and father,
it's all invented.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.784
Look, Harold Saxon
never went to Cambridge,

08:53.908 --> 08:56.081
there was no Harold Saxon!

08:56.161 --> 08:58.163
The thing is, it's obvious.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.841
The forgery is screaming out
and yet no one can see it!

09:01.916 --> 09:04.214
It's as if he's mesmerised
the entire world.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.841
I think perhaps you should leave now.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.890
Eighteen months ago he became real.

09:08.965 --> 09:12.890
This is his first
honest-to-God appearance,

09:12.969 --> 09:16.223
just after the downfall
of Harriet Jones.

09:17.015 --> 09:22.647
And at the exact same time,
they launched the Archangel Network.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.572
Mrs Rook, now stop it!

09:24.647 --> 09:28.277
Even now, they've said that
the Cabinet's gone into seclusion.

09:28.359 --> 09:29.906
What does that mean, seclusion?

09:29.986 --> 09:34.162
- How should I know?
- But I've got plenty of research on you.

09:34.240 --> 09:38.871
Yes, good family, Roedean,
not especially bright,

09:38.995 --> 09:43.125
but essentially harmless,
and that's why I'm asking you.

09:43.208 --> 09:46.132
Lucy, I am begging you,

09:46.211 --> 09:50.216
if you have seen anything,
heard anything,

09:50.340 --> 09:53.469
even the slightest thing that
would give you cause to doubt him...

09:53.551 --> 09:55.428
- I think...
- Yes?

09:56.846 --> 10:01.818
There was a time, when we first met,
I wondered...

10:01.893 --> 10:04.692
But he was so good
to my father, and he said...

10:04.854 --> 10:07.983
- What? just tell me, sweetheart.
- The thing is...

10:10.819 --> 10:13.572
- I made my choice.
- I'm sorry?

10:14.447 --> 10:16.745
For better or for worse.

10:16.825 --> 10:19.044
Isn't that right, Harry?

10:20.537 --> 10:24.167
- My faithful companion.
- Mr Saxon.

10:25.375 --> 10:29.926
Prime Minister.
I was just having a little joke with...

10:30.046 --> 10:35.394
- Poor little Lucy, I didn't mean...
- Oh, but you're absolutely right.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.310
Harold Saxon doesn't exist.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.226
Then tell me...

10:44.561 --> 10:47.235
- who are you?
- I am the Master.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.489
And these are my friends.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.784
I'm sorry.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.543
Can't you hear it, Mrs Rook?

11:04.622 --> 11:07.967
- What do you mean?
- The drumbeat.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.967
The drums are coming closer and closer.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.345
SPHERE 1: The lady doesn't like us.

11:16.551 --> 11:19.054
- No...
- Silly lady.

11:19.137 --> 11:21.731
- No...
- Dead lady.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.622
But she knew!

11:37.739 --> 11:41.164
Harry, she knew everything.
You promised.

11:41.284 --> 11:43.582
You said Archangel
was one hundred per cent.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.504
Urn. Ninety nine. Ninety eight?

11:45.580 --> 11:48.003
But if she's asking questions,
then who else?

11:48.082 --> 11:50.380
How much time have we got?

11:57.217 --> 12:00.187
Tomorrow morning, I promise.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.857
That's when everything ends.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.436
But he's got the Tardis.

12:08.519 --> 12:12.023
Maybe the Master went back in time,
and has been living here for decades.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.116
- No.
- Why not? Worked for me.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.694
When he was stealing the Tardis

12:15.777 --> 12:18.030
the only thing I could do
was fuse the coordinates.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.160
I locked them permanently.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.669
He can only travel between
the year one hundred trillion

12:24.744 --> 12:28.123
and the last place the Tardis landed.
Which is right here, right now.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.425
Yeah, but a little leeway?

12:30.500 --> 12:35.427
Well, 18 months, tops. The most
he could have been here is 18 months.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.883
So how's he managed all this?

12:38.007 --> 12:42.478
The Master was always sort of hypnotic,
but this is on a massive scale.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.226
- I was gonna vote for him.
- Really?

12:44.305 --> 12:48.060
Well, it was before I even met you.
And I liked him.

12:48.142 --> 12:51.021
- Me, too.
- Why do you say that?

12:52.188 --> 12:54.282
What was his policy,
what did he stand for?

12:54.357 --> 12:56.826
I don't know, he always sounded good.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.080
Like you could trust him.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.537
Just nice. He spoke about...

13:05.076 --> 13:07.955
I can't really remember,
but it was good.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.300
- Just the sound of his voice.
- What's that?

13:12.375 --> 13:14.252
- What?
- That! That tapping, that rhythm.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.259
- What are you doing?
- I don't know, it's nothing...

13:17.380 --> 13:19.599
I don't know!

13:22.427 --> 13:24.771
Our Lord and Master
is speaking to his kingdom.

13:24.846 --> 13:26.439
Britain, Britain, Britain.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.309
What extraordinary times we've had.

13:29.392 --> 13:32.862
Just a few years ago,
this world was so small.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.530
And then they came.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.404
Out of the unknown.
Falling from the skies.

13:37.525 --> 13:40.278
You've seen it happen.
Big Ben destroyed.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.159
A spaceship over London.

13:42.238 --> 13:48.211
All those ghosts and metal men,
the Christmas Star that came to kill.

13:48.286 --> 13:51.790
Time and time again and
the government told you nothing.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.755
Well, not me. Not Harold Saxon.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.838
Because my purpose here today
is to tell you this.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.173
Citizens of Great Britain...

14:02.884 --> 14:04.431
I have been contacted.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.772
A message for humanity
from beyond the stars.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.351
People of the Earth.

14:11.434 --> 14:15.109
We come in peace.
We bring you great gifts.

14:15.188 --> 14:18.488
We bring technology and
wisdom and protection.

14:18.608 --> 14:21.612
And all we ask in return
is your friendship.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.954
Oh, sweet.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.249
And this species has identified itself.

14:27.325 --> 14:30.124
- They're called the Toclafane.
- What?

14:30.203 --> 14:32.376
And tomorrow morning they will appear,

14:32.455 --> 14:35.755
not in secret, but to all of you.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.554
Diplomatic relations
with a new species will begin.

14:39.629 --> 14:45.102
Tomorrow, we take our place
in the universe.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.020
Every man, woman and child,

14:48.096 --> 14:51.646
every teacher and chemist
and lorry driver

14:51.766 --> 14:55.270
and farmer and,
oh, I don't know, every...

14:55.353 --> 14:57.026
medical student?

15:00.817 --> 15:02.569
Out!

15:16.416 --> 15:18.839
- All right? Martha?
- Fine, yeah, I'm fine.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.420
- What are you doing?
- He knows about me,

15:20.503 --> 15:22.801
- what about my family?
- Don't tell them anything.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.178
I'll do what I like!

15:26.300 --> 15:29.679
- Mum! Oh, my God, you're there.
- Course I'm here, sweetheart.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.481
- You all right'?
- I'm fine, no, I'm fine.

15:32.557 --> 15:35.026
Mum, has there been anyone
asking about me?

15:35.101 --> 15:37.729
Martha, I think perhaps
you should come round.

15:37.812 --> 15:40.281
- I can't, not now.
- No, but it's your father.

15:40.356 --> 15:43.235
We've been talking, and we thought
we might give it another go.

15:43.359 --> 15:46.363
- Don '1' be so daft! Since when?
- Just come round.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.827
Come to the house. We can celebrate.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.125
You'd never get back with him
in a million years.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.248
Ask him yourself.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.384
- Martha, it's me.
- Dad? What are you doing there?

15:59.500 --> 16:02.049
Like your mother said.
Come round, we can explain everything.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.972
Dad, just say yes or no.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.387
Is there someone else there?

16:09.218 --> 16:13.268
- Yes. just run! Listen to me, just run!
- Clive, stop it!

16:13.389 --> 16:15.312
- I don't know who they are!
- You stupid man!

16:15.391 --> 16:17.985
- We're trying to help her!
- Dad, what's going?

16:19.645 --> 16:22.899
- We've got to get Martha away from him!
- I've gotta help them.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.776
That's exactly what they want,
it's a trap!

16:24.901 --> 16:26.494
I don't care!

16:29.113 --> 16:30.911
Get off!

16:32.450 --> 16:35.249
It is your fault! All of you!

16:35.369 --> 16:37.792
You voted Saxon! You did this!

16:41.584 --> 16:43.006
Corner!

16:45.505 --> 16:50.432
Mr Saxon, we have Condition Red on
the Jones Plan, we're taking them in.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.729
- All of them.
- But I was helping you!

16:56.015 --> 16:58.359
Come on, Tish, pick up.

17:00.561 --> 17:03.986
Martha, can't talk now! We've just made
First Contact, did you see?

17:04.106 --> 17:06.029
What are you doing! Get off!

17:06.108 --> 17:08.781
- Linda, tell them!
- What's happening? Tish?

17:08.861 --> 17:10.784
It's your fault! It's all your fault!

17:10.905 --> 17:13.784
I was helping you! Get off me!

17:16.786 --> 17:20.040
Martha! Get out of here, get out!

17:20.122 --> 17:21.839
Target identified!

17:21.958 --> 17:23.255
Martha, reverse!

17:23.334 --> 17:25.462
- Take aim!
- Get out now!

17:25.962 --> 17:27.214
Fire!

17:27.880 --> 17:29.553
Move it!

17:34.136 --> 17:36.013
Take them away!

17:41.477 --> 17:43.479
The only place he can go
was planet Earth!

17:43.604 --> 17:44.856
Careful!

17:44.939 --> 17:46.737
Martha, listen to me, do as I say.

17:46.816 --> 17:50.992
We gotta ditch this car.
Pull over. Right now!

17:58.244 --> 18:00.997
- Martha, come on.
- Leo!

18:01.080 --> 18:03.708
Oh, thank God, Leo, you've gotta listen
to me. Where are you?

18:03.791 --> 18:06.419
I'm in Brighton.
Yeah, we came down with Boxer.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.220
Did you see that Saxon thing on telly?

18:08.337 --> 18:10.339
Leo, just listen to me, don't go home.

18:10.464 --> 18:15.345
I'm telling you, don't phone Mum or Dad
or Tish, you've gotta hide.

18:15.428 --> 18:18.307
- Shut up.
- On my life, you've gotta trust me.

18:18.389 --> 18:22.019
Go to Boxer's, stay with him,
don't tell anyone, just hide.

18:22.143 --> 18:25.864
Ooh, nice little game
of hide and seek, I love that!

18:25.938 --> 18:28.782
But I'll find you, Martha Jones.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.327
Been a long time since
we saw each other.

18:31.402 --> 18:34.121
Must be, what, a hundred trillion years?

18:34.196 --> 18:36.619
Let them go, Saxon!

18:36.699 --> 18:38.576
Do you hear me? Let them go!

18:41.037 --> 18:43.039
I'm here.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.595
- Doctor.
- Master.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.103
I like it when you use my name.

19:01.223 --> 19:04.147
You chose it. Psychiatrist's field day.

19:04.644 --> 19:08.740
As you chose yours.
The man who makes people better.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.696
How sanctimonious is that?

19:11.901 --> 19:15.030
So, Prime Minister, then?

19:15.112 --> 19:17.661
I know! It's good, isn't it?

19:17.740 --> 19:21.244
Who are those creatures?
There's no such thing as the Toclafane.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.375
That's just a made-up name,
like the bogeyman.

19:23.454 --> 19:28.426
Do you remember all those fairy tales
about the Toclafane when we were kids?

19:28.501 --> 19:30.549
Back home?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.513
Where is it, Doctor?

19:34.382 --> 19:37.135
- Gone.
- How can Gallifrey be gone?

19:40.388 --> 19:42.106
It burnt.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.560
And the Time Lords?

19:46.811 --> 19:48.188
Dead.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.774
And the Daleks. More or less.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.405
What happened to you?

19:54.485 --> 19:56.453
The Time Lords only resurrected me

19:56.570 --> 20:00.200
because they knew I'd be
the perfect warrior for a Time War.

20:00.324 --> 20:04.579
I was there when the Dalek Emperor
took control of the Cruciform.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.040
I saw it.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.375
I ran.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.636
Iran so far.

20:14.046 --> 20:17.641
Made myself human
so they would never find me,

20:19.135 --> 20:20.478
because...

20:22.471 --> 20:24.144
I was so scared.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.813
I kn ow.

20:27.309 --> 20:30.529
All of them? But not you.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.572
Which must mean...

20:32.648 --> 20:35.447
I was the only one who could end it.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.663
And I tried, I did, I tried everything.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.499
What did it feel like, though?

20:43.325 --> 20:47.171
Two almighty civilisations burning.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.462
Oh, tell me, how did that feel?

20:50.541 --> 20:54.387
- Stop it.
- You must have been like God.

20:55.546 --> 20:58.595
I've been alone ever since.

20:58.674 --> 21:02.349
But not any more. Don't you see,
all we've got is each other?

21:02.511 --> 21:04.138
Are you asking me out on a date?

21:04.221 --> 21:06.502
You could stop this right now,
we could leave this planet.

21:06.515 --> 21:09.109
We can fight across the constellations
if that's what you want.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.279
But not on Earth.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.031
Too late.

21:15.566 --> 21:18.445
- Why do you say that?
- The drumming.

21:19.862 --> 21:21.956
Can't you hear it?

21:22.031 --> 21:24.534
I thought it would stop,
but it never does.

21:24.658 --> 21:28.037
It never, ever stops. Inside my head.

21:28.120 --> 21:32.091
The drumming, Doctor,
the constant drumming.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.923
I can help you. Please let me help.

21:35.002 --> 21:38.723
It's everywhere. Listen, listen, listen.

21:42.885 --> 21:44.887
Here come the drums.

21:45.429 --> 21:48.478
Here come the drums.

21:52.186 --> 21:54.280
What have you done?

21:54.563 --> 21:58.033
Tell me how you've done this.
What are those creatures? Tell me!

21:58.108 --> 21:59.610
Ooh, look, you're on TV!

21:59.735 --> 22:03.080
- Stop it. Answer me.
- No, really, you're on telly!

22:03.948 --> 22:06.292
You and your little band.

22:06.408 --> 22:09.582
Which, by the way, is ticking
every demographic box.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.916
So congratulations on that.
Look, there you are!

22:13.791 --> 22:17.421
They are known to be armed
and extremely dangerous.

22:17.503 --> 22:21.724
You're public enemies
number one, two and three!

22:21.799 --> 22:24.848
Oh, and you can tell handsome jack

22:24.927 --> 22:29.524
that I've sent his little gang off on
a wild goose chase to the Himalayas

22:29.598 --> 22:32.101
so he won't be getting
any help from them.

22:33.060 --> 22:37.486
Now go on, off you go.
Why not start by turning to the... right?

22:39.608 --> 22:41.235
He can see us.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.821
Ooh, you public menace.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.950
Better start running! Go on, run!

22:50.035 --> 22:51.833
He's got control of everything.

22:51.954 --> 22:56.175
- What do we do?
- We've got nowhere to go.

22:56.250 --> 23:00.596
- Doctor, what do we do?
- Run, Doctor!

23:01.463 --> 23:04.558
- Run for your life!
- We run.

23:09.430 --> 23:11.432
I said, run!

23:14.894 --> 23:18.819
Tomorrow morning, Britain will be
welcoming an extraterrestrial species...

23:19.231 --> 23:20.983
The President is said to be furious that

23:21.108 --> 23:23.202
Great Britain 's
taken unilateral action...

23:42.796 --> 23:44.798
Have you seen these things?

23:45.925 --> 23:48.428
This planet's amazing.

23:48.844 --> 23:54.317
Television in their stomach.
Now that is evolution!

23:55.142 --> 23:58.612
- Is the machine ready?
- Tomorrow morning.

23:59.688 --> 24:03.784
It reaches critical at 8:02 precisely.

24:03.901 --> 24:07.781
We have to escape
because it's coming, sir, the darkness.

24:07.863 --> 24:12.118
The never-ending darkness
and the terrible, terrible cold.

24:12.201 --> 24:14.545
We have to run and run and run.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.214
8:00, tomorrow morning.

24:19.083 --> 24:23.213
Tell your people the world is waiting.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.654
How was it?

24:40.729 --> 24:42.823
I don't think anyone saw me.
Anything new?

24:42.898 --> 24:44.821
I got this tuned into
the government wavelength

24:44.900 --> 24:48.154
- so we can follow what Saxon's doing.
- I meant about my family.

24:48.237 --> 24:51.662
Still says the Jones family
taken in for questioning.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.118
Tell you what, though,
no mention of Leo.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.541
He's not as daft as he looks.

24:57.454 --> 25:00.173
I'm talking about my brother,
on the run, how did this happen?

25:00.249 --> 25:03.753
- Nice chips.
- Actually, they're not bad.

25:09.425 --> 25:12.520
So, Doctor, who is he?

25:12.594 --> 25:16.349
How come the ancient society of
Time Lords created a psychopath?

25:16.515 --> 25:17.858
And what is he to you?

25:17.933 --> 25:20.561
- Like a colleague, or...
- A friend at first.

25:20.644 --> 25:24.945
Thought you were gonna say he was
your secret brother or something.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.868
You've been watching too much TV.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.822
But all the legends of Gallifrey
made it sound so perfect.

25:30.946 --> 25:35.577
Well, perfect to look at, maybe.
And it was, it was beautiful.

25:37.077 --> 25:40.627
They used to call it
the Shining World of the Seven Systems.

25:41.623 --> 25:44.376
And on the continent of Wild Endeavour,

25:45.461 --> 25:48.635
in the mountains of Solace and Solitude,

25:48.756 --> 25:51.635
there stood the Citadel
of the Time Lords.

25:54.928 --> 25:58.182
The oldest and most mighty
race in the universe,

26:00.184 --> 26:03.108
looking down an the galaxies below,

26:03.979 --> 26:05.731
sworn never to interfere.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.154
Only to watch.

26:08.942 --> 26:10.910
Children of Gallifrey,

26:11.028 --> 26:13.827
taken from their families
at the age of eight

26:13.947 --> 26:15.745
to enter the Academy.

26:15.866 --> 26:18.745
And some say that's where it all began.

26:19.787 --> 26:21.630
When he was a child.

26:23.665 --> 26:26.339
That's when the Master saw eternity.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.594
As a novice,
he was taken for initiation.

26:31.673 --> 26:35.098
He stood in front of
the Untempered Schism,

26:35.177 --> 26:38.021
it's a gap in the fabric of reality

26:38.097 --> 26:40.941
through which could be seen
the whole of the Vortex.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.689
You stand there,

26:44.186 --> 26:45.859
eight years old,

26:48.023 --> 26:51.778
staring at the raw power of
time and space-just a child.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.116
Some would be inspired.

26:58.659 --> 27:00.536
Some would run away.

27:03.705 --> 27:05.958
And some would go mad.

27:14.967 --> 27:18.346
- I don't know.
- What about you?

27:18.428 --> 27:22.103
Oh, the ones that ran away.
I never stopped.

27:26.061 --> 27:28.439
Encrypted channel with files attached.

27:28.522 --> 27:31.571
- Don't recognise it.
- Hmm, patch it through to the laptop.

27:31.692 --> 27:35.617
Since we're telling stories,
there's something I haven't told you.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.998
You work for Torchwood?

27:42.077 --> 27:44.250
I swear to you, it's different,
it's changed.

27:44.329 --> 27:45.831
There's only half a dozen of us now.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.666
Everything Torchwood did
and you're part of it?

27:47.749 --> 27:49.922
The old regime was destroyed
at Canary Wharf.

27:50.043 --> 27:53.468
I rebuilt it, I changed it,
and when I did that, I did it for you.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.762
In your honour.

28:04.141 --> 28:07.315
If I haven 't returned to my desk by 2200

28:07.436 --> 28:09.985
this file will be emailed to Torchwood.

28:10.063 --> 28:13.363
Which means if you're watching this,
then I'm. . -

28:14.151 --> 28:17.155
Anyway, the Saxon files are attached

28:17.279 --> 28:20.123
but fake a look
at the Archangel document'.

28:20.199 --> 28:23.373
That's when it all started,
when Harry Saxon became Minister

28:23.452 --> 28:26.547
in charge of launching
the Archangel Network.

28:26.622 --> 28:29.967
- What's the Archangel Network?
- I've got Archangel, everyone's got it.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.761
It's the mobile phone network.
'Cause look, it's gone worldwide.

28:32.836 --> 28:34.713
They've got 15 satellites in orbit.

28:34.796 --> 28:38.517
Even the other networks,
they're all carried by Archangel.

28:38.592 --> 28:41.766
It's in the phones!
Oh, I said he was a hypnotist.

28:41.845 --> 28:44.815
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

28:47.100 --> 28:50.604
There it is! That rhythm.
It's everywhere.

28:50.687 --> 28:53.361
Ticking away in the subconscious.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.740
- What is it, mind control?
- No, no, no, no. Subtler than that.

28:56.818 --> 28:58.616
Any strong-willed people
would question it.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.743
But contained in that rhythm,
in layers of code,

29:00.822 --> 29:04.372
"Vote Saxon. Believe in me."
Whispering to the world.

29:05.202 --> 29:07.580
Oh! Yes!
That's how he hid himself from me!

29:07.663 --> 29:09.916
'Cause I should've sensed
there was another Time Lord on Earth.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.672
I should've known way back,
but the signal cancelled him out.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.344
AW Way you can stop it?

29:14.419 --> 29:16.888
Not from down here.
But now we know how he's doing it.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.342
- And we can fight back?
- Oh, yes!

29:39.069 --> 29:41.367
Three Tardis keys,
three pieces of the Tardis,

29:41.446 --> 29:42.914
all with low-level perception properties

29:42.990 --> 29:45.209
because the Tardis
is designed to blend in.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.456
Well, sort of, but now,

29:46.535 --> 29:49.004
the Archangel Network's got
a second low-level signal.

29:49.079 --> 29:52.379
Weld the key to the network,
and Martha...

29:52.499 --> 29:53.967
Look at me, you can see me, yes?

29:54.042 --> 29:56.170
- Yep!
- What about now?

30:04.803 --> 30:06.805
No, I'm here, look at me.

30:06.888 --> 30:11.064
It's like I know you're there,
but I don't want to know.

30:11.184 --> 30:12.481
And back again!

30:12.561 --> 30:15.235
See? It just shifts your perception,
a tiny little bit.

30:15.397 --> 30:18.367
Doesn't make us invisible.
Just unnoticed.

30:18.442 --> 30:20.615
Oh! I know what it's like! It's like...

30:20.694 --> 30:23.415
It's like when you fancy someone,
and they don't even know you exist.

30:23.572 --> 30:25.916
That's what it's like. Come on!

30:28.410 --> 30:30.378
You too, huh?

30:34.458 --> 30:35.960
Don't run.

30:37.044 --> 30:39.888
Don't shout, just keep your voice down.

30:40.630 --> 30:43.304
Draw attention to yourself
and the spell is broken.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.511
Just keep to the shadows.

30:45.594 --> 30:46.891
- Like ghosts.
- Yeah.

30:46.970 --> 30:50.099
That's what we are. Ghosts.

31:11.119 --> 31:14.669
And as the eyes of the world
turn to wards Great Britain

31:14.790 --> 31:19.421
sources indicate that Air Force One
has landed on British soil tonight.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.890
Mr President, sir!

31:32.849 --> 31:35.477
Mr Saxon, the British Army
will stand down.

31:35.602 --> 31:38.321
From now on, UNIT has control
of this operation.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.616
You make it sound like an invasion.

31:40.690 --> 31:44.411
The First Contact Policy was decided by
the Security Council in 1968

31:44.486 --> 31:45.926
and you've just gone and ignored it.

31:45.987 --> 31:49.116
Well, you know what it's like,
new job, all that paperwork.

31:49.199 --> 31:50.917
I think it's down
the back of the settee.

31:50.992 --> 31:53.871
I did have a quick look,
I found a pen, a sweet,

31:53.995 --> 31:57.374
a bus ticket, and...
Have you met the wife?

31:58.917 --> 32:01.011
Mr Saxon,
I'm not sure what your game is,

32:01.086 --> 32:02.679
but there are provisions at the UN

32:02.754 --> 32:06.509
to have you removed from office
unless you are very, very careful.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.385
Is that understood?

32:10.178 --> 32:14.524
Are you taking this seriously?
To business.

32:14.599 --> 32:18.479
We've accessed your files
on these Toclafane.

32:18.562 --> 32:21.691
But First Contact cannot take
place on any sovereign soil.

32:21.773 --> 32:25.198
To that purpose, the aircraft carrier
Valiant is en route.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.951
The rendezvous
will take place there at 8:00 am.

32:30.031 --> 32:32.454
You're trying my patience, sir.

32:35.036 --> 32:39.758
- So America is completely in charge?
- Since Britain elected an ass, yes.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.301
I'll see you on board the Valiant.

32:41.376 --> 32:45.051
It still will be televised, though,
won't it?

32:45.130 --> 32:48.600
Because I promised,
and the whole world is watching.

32:48.675 --> 32:52.976
Since it's too late to pull out,
the world will be watching.

32:53.054 --> 32:54.727
Me.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.863
The last President of America.

33:04.983 --> 33:08.112
We have a private plane
ready and waiting.

33:08.195 --> 33:11.495
We should reach the Valiant
within the hour.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.075
My darling...

33:46.358 --> 33:48.031
Hi, guys!

33:48.109 --> 33:50.532
What are you doing!

33:50.612 --> 33:53.832
- All! All will be revealed.
- Saxon!

33:53.907 --> 33:55.204
Oh, my God!

33:55.325 --> 33:56.827
- Don't move.
- But...

33:56.952 --> 33:59.000
Don't!

33:59.162 --> 34:01.290
I'm gonna kill him.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.341
What say I use this perception filter

34:03.416 --> 34:06.295
to walk up behind him
and break his neck?

34:06.836 --> 34:09.214
Now that sounds like Torchwood.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.800
Still a good plan.

34:12.467 --> 34:16.813
He's a Time Lord.
Which makes him my responsibility.

34:17.639 --> 34:21.815
I'm not here to kill him.
I'm here to save him.

34:23.978 --> 34:27.483
Aircraft carrier Valiant
that's a UNIT ship,

34:27.607 --> 34:32.158
at 58.2 North, 10.02 East.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.239
How do we get on board?

34:34.322 --> 34:37.952
- Does that thing work as a teleport?
- Since you revamped it, yeah.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.706
Coordinates set.

34:47.210 --> 34:50.554
- Oh, that thing is rough!
- I've had worse nights.

34:53.049 --> 34:56.679
- Welcome to the Valiant.
- It's dawn.

34:58.513 --> 35:01.232
Hold on, I thought this was a ship,
where's the sea?

35:01.349 --> 35:03.977
A ship for the 21st century.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.064
Protecting the skies of planet Earth.

35:19.242 --> 35:21.119
Europe now online.

35:21.202 --> 35:25.378
A waiting confirmation from South America
and keep tracking Japan.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.845
I want the whole thing branded with
my Seal of Office, not the UN,

35:30.920 --> 35:32.797
have you got that?

35:35.216 --> 35:36.763
Anything I can do?

35:36.885 --> 35:39.513
I could make the tea?
Or isn't that American enough?

35:39.638 --> 35:42.608
I don't know, I could make grits.
What are grits anyway?

35:42.724 --> 35:44.647
If you could just sit.

35:46.603 --> 35:51.234
Misery guts.
What do you think? It's good, isn't it?

35:51.566 --> 35:53.159
It's beautiful.

35:54.319 --> 35:56.162
Some of my best work.

35:56.237 --> 36:01.243
Ministry of Defence,
I helped design this place.

36:05.038 --> 36:06.790
Every detail.

36:13.213 --> 36:17.184
- We've no time for sight-seeing!
- No, wait, shh, shh.

36:17.258 --> 36:19.101
- Can't you hear it?
- Hear what?

36:19.177 --> 36:22.226
- Doctor, my family's on board...
- Brilliant!

36:23.223 --> 36:24.600
This way!

36:37.987 --> 36:40.240
- Oh, at last!
- Oh, yes!

36:40.323 --> 36:42.746
What's it doing on the Valiant?

36:46.413 --> 36:48.336
- What the hell's he done?
- Don't touch it!

36:48.456 --> 36:49.708
I'm not going to!

36:49.791 --> 36:53.546
What's he done, though?
Sounds like it's sick.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.630
It can't be.

36:55.755 --> 36:58.634
No, no, no, no, no, no, it can't be.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.596
- Doctor, what is it?
- He's cannibalised the Tardis.

37:01.678 --> 37:04.147
Is this what I think it is?

37:04.222 --> 37:06.316
It's a paradox machine.

37:07.976 --> 37:09.899
Two minutes, everyone.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.941
According to the treaty,
all armed personnel

37:14.023 --> 37:17.243
are requested to leave the flight deck
immediately, thank you.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.287
Jelly baby?

37:20.363 --> 37:22.331
Broadcasting at 7:58,

37:22.407 --> 37:25.707
with the arrival timed for
0800 hours exactly.

37:25.827 --> 37:28.831
And good luck to all of us.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.839
As soon as this hits red, it activates.

37:32.959 --> 37:36.884
At this speed, it'll trigger at 8:02.

37:36.963 --> 37:39.557
First Contact is at 8:00,
then two minutes later...

37:39.674 --> 37:41.676
But what's it for?
What does a paradox machine do?

37:41.801 --> 37:45.180
- More important, can you stop it?
- Not till I know what it's doing.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.433
Touch the wrong bit,
blow up the solar system.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.267
Then we've gotta get to the Master!

37:49.350 --> 37:52.650
- Yeah, how we gonna stop him?
- Oh, I've got a way.

37:52.854 --> 37:55.027
Sorry, didn't I mention it?

37:56.274 --> 38:00.404
And in just 30 seconds' time,
we 'll be going live to First Contact.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.496
It's been announced that Harold Saxon

38:02.572 --> 38:05.246
has invited President Winters
to take the address.

38:05.325 --> 38:08.704
It's 3:00 am in the morning
on the Eastern Seaboard

38:08.828 --> 38:13.550
and President Wiinters has been chosen
to lead the world into a new age.

38:15.752 --> 38:19.302
My fellow Americans, patriots,
people of the world.

38:19.380 --> 38:23.635
I stand before you today
as ambassador for humanity.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.972
A role I will undertake
with the utmost solemnity.

38:27.055 --> 38:30.275
Perhaps our Toclafane cousins
can offer us much.

38:30.391 --> 38:33.816
But what is important is not
that we gain material benefits,

38:33.895 --> 38:37.240
but that we learn to see ourselves anew.

38:37.357 --> 38:40.486
For as long as man
has looked to the stars

38:40.568 --> 38:43.492
he has wondered what
mysteries they hold.

38:43.613 --> 38:45.240
Now we know we are not alone.

38:45.365 --> 38:48.118
This plan, you gonna tell us?

38:48.243 --> 38:50.712
If I can get this around
the Master's neck,

38:50.787 --> 38:53.165
cancel out his perception,
they'll see him for real.

38:53.248 --> 38:57.754
It's just hard to go unnoticed
when everyone is on red alert.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.714
If they stop me, you've got a key.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.762
- Yes, sir.
- I'll get him.

39:03.466 --> 39:07.061
And I ask you now,
I ask of the human race,

39:07.136 --> 39:10.515
to join with me
in welcoming our friends.

39:10.598 --> 39:13.317
I give you the Toclafane.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.532
My name is Arthur Coleman Winters,

39:23.611 --> 39:25.864
President Elect of
the United States of America,

39:25.947 --> 39:29.076
and Designated Representative
of the United Nations.

39:29.158 --> 39:33.208
I welcome you to the planet Earth
and its associated moon.

39:33.288 --> 39:35.040
You're not the Master.

39:35.123 --> 39:37.091
We like the Mr Master.

39:37.166 --> 39:41.967
- We don't like you.
- I can be master if you so wish.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.886
I will accept mastery over you
if that is God's will.

39:47.969 --> 39:49.846
Man is stupid.

39:49.971 --> 39:51.894
Master is our friend.

39:51.973 --> 39:55.398
Where's my Master, pretty please?

39:55.476 --> 39:58.150
Oh, all right, then. It's me!

39:58.396 --> 40:01.115
Ta-da! Sorry!

40:01.316 --> 40:03.785
Sorry, I have this effect,
people just get obsessed.

40:03.860 --> 40:08.866
Is it the smile, is it the aftershave,
is it the capacity to laugh at myself?

40:08.948 --> 40:10.791
I don't know! It's crazy!

40:10.909 --> 40:13.753
Saxon, what are you talking about?

40:13.828 --> 40:17.924
I'm taking control, Uncle Sam.
Starting with you.

40:19.292 --> 40:20.839
Kill him!

40:30.845 --> 40:34.520
Guards, nobody move! Nobody move!

40:34.641 --> 40:36.109
Now then!

40:36.184 --> 40:39.814
Peoples of the Earth,
please attend carefully.

40:39.896 --> 40:42.024
Stop him!

40:43.566 --> 40:46.570
We meet at last, Doctor.

40:46.653 --> 40:48.781
Oh! I love saying that!

40:48.863 --> 40:50.365
Stop this! Stop it now!

40:50.448 --> 40:52.871
As if a perception filter is gonna
work on me.

40:52.951 --> 40:56.831
And look, it's the girlie and the freak.

40:56.913 --> 40:59.382
Although I'm not sure which one's which.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.972
Laser screwdriver. Who'd have sonic?

41:06.047 --> 41:09.472
And the good thing is, he's not dead
for long. I get to kill him again!

41:09.550 --> 41:11.143
Master, just calm down.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.267
Just look at what you're doing,
just stop.

41:13.346 --> 41:14.973
If you could see yourself.

41:15.765 --> 41:18.735
Do excuse me, little bit of personal
business. Back in a minute.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.403
Let him go.

41:21.479 --> 41:24.608
It's that sound, the sound in your head.
What if I can help?

41:24.691 --> 41:27.410
Oh! How to shut him up?

41:27.527 --> 41:29.700
I know! Memory lane!

41:31.531 --> 41:36.082
Professor Lazarus, remember him?
And his genetic manipulation device!

41:39.747 --> 41:42.842
What, did you think little Tish
got that job merely by coincidence?

41:42.917 --> 41:45.591
I've been laying traps for you
all this time!

41:45.670 --> 41:47.547
And if I can concentrate all that

41:47.630 --> 41:51.680
Lazarus technology into
one little screwdriver...

41:53.177 --> 41:58.104
But, ooh, if only I had
the Doctor's biological code.

41:58.599 --> 42:01.398
Oh! Wait a minute! I do!

42:02.311 --> 42:04.109
I've got his hand!

42:04.981 --> 42:10.158
And if Lazarus made himself younger,
what if I reverse it?

42:10.278 --> 42:12.997
Another 100 years?

42:19.328 --> 42:21.251
- Teleport.
- I can't.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.213
We can't stop him.

42:24.292 --> 42:25.965
Get out of here.

42:27.295 --> 42:28.638
Get out.

42:39.766 --> 42:42.610
Doctor, I've got you.

42:42.685 --> 42:45.234
Ah, she's a would-be doctor.

42:45.646 --> 42:48.741
But tonight, Martha Jones,

42:48.816 --> 42:52.662
we've flown them in,
all the way from prison.

42:57.784 --> 43:00.128
- Mum.
- I'm sorry.

43:04.248 --> 43:07.923
The Toclafane. What are they?

43:09.796 --> 43:11.264
Who are they?

43:11.339 --> 43:16.596
Doctor, if I told you the truth,
your hearts would break.

43:17.428 --> 43:20.272
- Is it time?
- Is it ready?

43:20.348 --> 43:22.350
Is the machine singing?

43:24.852 --> 43:26.695
Two minutes past!

43:30.024 --> 43:33.449
So, Earthlings!

43:34.529 --> 43:37.624
Basically, um...

43:38.699 --> 43:40.417
End of the world.

43:41.577 --> 43:44.922
Here come the drums!

44:19.615 --> 44:23.586
- How many do you think?
- I don't know!

44:23.661 --> 44:25.755
Six billion!

44:27.665 --> 44:29.417
Down you go, kids!

44:52.815 --> 44:54.817
Shall we decimate them?

44:55.943 --> 44:59.163
That sounds good, nice word, decimate.

45:01.532 --> 45:05.457
Remove one tenth of the population!

45:11.125 --> 45:13.719
This is Geneva!
We 're getting slaughtered down here!

45:13.794 --> 45:16.718
Valiant, report! Help us!
For God's sake help us!

45:18.966 --> 45:22.220
This is London, Valiant.
This is London. What do we do?

45:22.303 --> 45:26.774
They're killing us! The Toclafane...
They're killing us!

46:17.149 --> 46:18.822
I'm coming back.

46:21.362 --> 46:23.865
And so it came to pass

46:24.031 --> 46:28.912
that the human race fell
and the Earth was no more.

46:30.246 --> 46:35.878
And I looked down upon my new dominion
as master of all.

46:37.003 --> 46:40.598
And I thought it good.

47:42.443 --> 47:44.161
Ever since I was a child

47:44.236 --> 47:47.490
I looked into the Vortex,
that's when it chose me.

47:47.573 --> 47:50.452
The drumming, the call to war.

48:05.633 --> 48:07.727
Can't you hear it?
