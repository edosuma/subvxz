Yes, we're very excited
to have Mr. Jackson with Higher for Hire.

That's "Higher" as in up
and "Hire" as in for money.

05:01.375 --> 05:05.792
a contract between Klopstokia
and Khan Enterprises

05:05.875 --> 05:08.709
would be more than mutually beneficial.

05:08.792 --> 05:14.208
But Chairman Khan, only our president
can award exclusive delivery contracts.

05:14.291 --> 05:20.208
That may well be, but what President Myron
doesn't know won't hurt him,

05:20.291 --> 05:24.917

no one can upset your plans?

Look, Baloo, on the strength
of his name alone,

05:59.709 --> 06:02.542
Mr. Jackson brought in
five times the business.

06:02.625 --> 06:07.834
Oh, wonderful.
That means five times less shut-eye.

around the harbor and get to know her.

Yeah, right.

07:26.125 --> 07:30.291

to stall out my old biplane.

-Yes, sir.
-Yeah.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.750
She's kind of high-strung sometimes.
[groans]

07:59.834 --> 08:01.750
Dandy piece of machinery, all right.

08:01.834 --> 08:04.291
Take a little loop like that
and the engine catches fire.

08:04.709 --> 08:07.375
We better get her down so we can
put the fire out.

08:19.083 --> 08:21.542
Can't they see we have a fire here?

08:26.458 --> 08:28.959
Hope that engine holds
till we get her down.

08:29.041 --> 08:33.125
[Baloo gasps]
It's the getting down that's worrying me.

08:37.082 --> 08:40.875
Hoppin' hot flapjacks on Sunday morning.
I'm gonna miss that.

08:40.958 --> 08:44.417

Oh, maybe Wildcat will take him.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.625
Better buckle up good, Baloo.

-Let me show you.

-Whistlestop, are you all right?
-I'm splendid, my dear.

could have hurt someone!

09:19.583 --> 09:21.834
Huh? Me?

09:21.917 --> 09:24.875
I can't believe you've become
so jealous of Mr. Jackson,

09:24.959 --> 09:27.041
that you'd endanger him
and the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

09:27.125 --> 09:30.875
-Now just a dive-bombing second!
-[Rebecca] You're acting like a big baby

09:30.959 --> 09:34.959
just because the name Whistlestop Jackson
means something in this business,

09:35.041 --> 09:37.917
while the name Baloo just means Ba-loo.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.208
Don't be so hard on him Rebecca,
it wasn't his fault.

09:41.291 --> 09:44.625

so they think they've shot me down.

13:59.709 --> 14:02.959
Khan? What's he got his tail
in a knot about?

14:03.041 --> 14:08.291
Well, he has a grudge that goes way back
to when I beat him on a mail deal.

14:08.375 --> 14:12.166
Yeah, to tell the truth, Baloo,
the famous Whistlestop Jackson

14:12.250 --> 14:16.542
hasn't been having much luck lately
since those newfangled planes hit the sky.

14:17.041 --> 14:21.542
I thought at Higher for Hire I could
fade away in a flash of brilliance,

14:21.625 --> 14:24.458
but I've been kidding myself.

14:24.542 --> 14:27.625
Looks like Khan's
gonna fade me away permanently.

14:27.709 --> 14:31.291
I guess he finally beat the legend.

14:31.375 --> 14:33.083
If we don't make this run,

14:33.166 --> 14:37.834
he's not only gonna beat you,
he's gonna get Becky's business to boot.

14:38.625 --> 14:42.208
And I don't think a hero to millions,
including yours truly,

14:42.291 --> 14:45.834
is about to let that happen.
Do you?

14:49.625 --> 14:54.166
Can't you work any faster, Baloo?
We've got fireworks to deliver.

14:54.250 --> 14:55.542
[Baloo laughs]

14:55.625 --> 14:57.959
<i>Now you're talking, Jackson!</i>

15:05.625 --> 15:08.125
[crowd chattering]

15:14.208 --> 15:16.250
[sighs] What a pity.

15:16.333 --> 15:20.000
Independence Day
and not a firework in sight.

15:20.083 --> 15:24.041
Yes, what a pity.
[chuckling]

15:24.125 --> 15:29.250
It would seem I have settled
an old rivalry, once and for all,

15:29.333 --> 15:32.083
as well as making us both rich.

15:32.166 --> 15:33.500
[whispering]

15:35.000 --> 15:37.917
Such a persistent nuisance, he is.

15:38.000 --> 15:43.458
What? Jackson? Is he alive?
Is he coming here? I'm ruined!

15:44.166 --> 15:47.291
I'm not gonna have to
give the money back, am I?

15:47.375 --> 15:50.208
All is well, finance minister.

15:50.291 --> 15:54.875
When they fail to arrive by 8:00,
as they shall,

15:54.959 --> 15:57.583
the contract will be void.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.041
What time now?

16:11.291 --> 16:12.417
Five till 8:00.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.875
And there's the lights of the capital!
We made it!

16:15.959 --> 16:18.542
If we can get past them.

16:29.709 --> 16:30.959
Which way did they go?

16:34.709 --> 16:37.959
I had to ask.
Hang on!

16:44.417 --> 16:49.709
They got us outnumbered, maybe outclassed,
and downright outdone!

16:49.792 --> 16:50.750
[gunfire]

16:50.834 --> 16:54.458
All we need is some backup,
a way to buy us some time.

16:56.166 --> 16:58.458
Yeah, but where are we going to find any?

16:58.542 --> 17:00.417
Right behind us.

17:02.166 --> 17:03.417
Where?

17:11.834 --> 17:15.333
[Mr. Khan] Two minutes to 8:00.
[chuckles]

17:15.416 --> 17:17.959
You know, Mr. Lafong,
I really think you might

17:18.040 --> 17:21.750
announce the celebration's cancellation.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.333
[grunting]

17:36.750 --> 17:37.583
Whoa!

17:41.875 --> 17:43.250
[laughs]

18:01.333 --> 18:04.375
I sure could use some artillery about now.

18:21.667 --> 18:25.333
People of Klopstokia,
our president announces

18:25.417 --> 18:28.917
that due to the failure
of Higher for Hire,

18:29.000 --> 18:33.625
tonight's Independence Day celebration
has regretfully been...

19:23.166 --> 19:25.166
[crowd exclaims]

19:59.500 --> 20:01.083
[crowd exclaims]

20:10.166 --> 20:14.500
-We did it, Baloo!
-Attaboy, Jackson!

20:20.375 --> 20:23.000
Mr. Khan!
I don't understand!

20:23.083 --> 20:25.417
What... what happened?

20:25.500 --> 20:31.875
It seems Whistlestop Jackson happened...
again.

20:44.166 --> 20:47.125
[Baloo laughs]
What a guy! Ho-ho-ho!

20:47.208 --> 20:50.875
-You did it!
-Yeah! All right!

20:52.792 --> 20:56.709
You made this company
a lot of money, Mr. Jackson.

20:56.792 --> 20:59.291
It was Baloo, here, who did all the work.

20:59.375 --> 21:01.417
He's the real hero.

21:01.500 --> 21:04.583
Oh, shucks.
It was all in a day's work

21:04.667 --> 21:07.625
for your above average, legend protege.

21:09.291 --> 21:11.875
Do you have to leave, Mr. Whistlestop?

21:11.959 --> 21:16.333
Son, I did what I came to do.
One last flash of brilliance.

21:16.417 --> 21:21.125
Now I can finally fade away
to somewhere nice and quiet.

21:21.208 --> 21:24.875
And I'm leaving the world
in pretty good hands.

21:27.166 --> 21:31.500
All in all,
it's been a rousing success.

21:31.583 --> 21:34.166
After all, it was my intention all along

21:34.250 --> 21:37.875
to force Mr. Jackson into retirement.

21:37.959 --> 21:44.458
And that is precisely what I have done,
wouldn't you say?

21:47.041 --> 21:49.667
I knew you'd agree.

21:50.166 --> 21:53.875
