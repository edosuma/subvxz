WEBVTT

00:33.400 --> 00:34.300
WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:34.366 --> 00:35.533
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:35.600 --> 00:36.166
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:36.233 --> 00:37.066
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:37.133 --> 00:39.633
US.

00:39.700 --> 00:40.866
IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:40.933 --> 00:41.800
RUSSIA'S WAR ON UKRAINE ENTERED

00:41.866 --> 00:42.900
ITS SIXTH MONTH, MONKEYPOX

00:42.966 --> 00:44.033
CONTINUES TO SPREAD AROUND THE

00:44.100 --> 00:45.633
WORLD, AND IN DC, WEST

00:45.700 --> 00:47.866
VIRGINIA'S NASTIEST LITTLE COAL

00:47.933 --> 00:49.233
SKANK FINALLY DECIDED TO ACT

00:49.300 --> 00:52.466
LIKE A DEMOCRAT FOR ONCE.

00:53.533 --> 00:54.566
BUT WE'RE GOING TO START TONIGHT

00:54.633 --> 00:55.433
IN EUROPE, WHICH HAS HAD A

00:55.500 --> 00:56.033
DRAMATIC SUMMER.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.333
A MASSIVE HEAT WAVE HAS ENGULFED

00:57.400 --> 00:58.000
THE CONTINENT, AND A WALRUS

00:58.066 --> 00:59.900
NAMED FREYA HAS CAUSED ABSOLUTE

00:59.966 --> 01:01.500
CHAOS.

01:01.566 --> 01:03.033
>> FAR FROM THE ARCTIC'S ICY

01:03.100 --> 01:04.200
WATERS, THIS LONE WALRUS HAS

01:04.266 --> 01:05.566
SANK SEVERAL SMALL BOATS AND

01:05.633 --> 01:07.033
INFLATABLES IN DENMARK,

01:07.100 --> 01:08.333
SCOTLAND, THE NETHERLANDS, AND

01:08.400 --> 01:09.233
NOW NORWAY IN HER ATTEMPT TO

01:09.300 --> 01:10.500
SUNBATHE.

01:10.566 --> 01:12.100
>> THE DAMAGE FROM A 700 KILO

01:12.166 --> 01:12.700
WALRUS ON YOUR BOAT CAN BE

01:12.766 --> 01:14.400
EXTENSIVE.

01:14.466 --> 01:16.400
ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE CHOOSES A

01:16.466 --> 01:19.700
VESSEL THAT'S NOT WALRUS-WORTHY.

01:20.600 --> 01:21.800
UNSURPRISINGLY, BOAT OWNERS

01:21.866 --> 01:22.600
AREN'T EXCITED TO SHARE WITH

01:22.666 --> 01:23.466
FREYA.

01:23.533 --> 01:24.466
>> I DON'T WANT IT ON THE DOCK

01:24.533 --> 01:28.233
OR ON MY BOAT.

01:28.300 --> 01:29.033
JUST GET IT AWAY FROM HERE.

01:29.100 --> 01:30.133
NO!

01:30.200 --> 01:30.900
DON'T DO THAT!

01:30.966 --> 01:31.900
BECAUSE I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT

01:31.966 --> 01:34.633
NORWAY BEING TERRORIZED BY A

01:34.700 --> 01:40.100
WALRUS IN VACATION MODE, SINKING

01:40.166 --> 01:40.600
BOATS LIKE THEY'RE THREE

01:40.666 --> 01:41.800
POINTERS.

01:41.866 --> 01:43.000
BUT ALSO, FREYA'S NOT A MOSQUITO

01:43.066 --> 01:49.233
YOU CAN JUST SWAT AWAY, SHE'S A

01:49.300 --> 01:49.800
1,300 POUND WATER QUEEN, AND

01:49.866 --> 01:50.866
GUESS WHAT?

01:50.933 --> 01:52.033
SHE'S THE CAPTAIN NOW.

01:52.100 --> 01:53.000
BUT BOATS AREN'T THE ONLY THING

01:53.066 --> 01:53.766
BEING UPENDED IN EUROPE.

01:53.833 --> 01:54.800
MULTIPLE COUNTRIES ARE IN THE

01:54.866 --> 01:55.600
PROCESS OF CHOOSING NEW LEADERS,

01:55.666 --> 01:56.533
INCLUDING THE UK, WHERE BORIS

01:56.600 --> 01:57.366
JOHNSON FINALLY STEPPED DOWN

01:57.433 --> 01:58.166
EARLIER THIS MONTH, AFTER

01:58.233 --> 01:58.966
SUCCUMBING TO A SERIES OF

01:59.033 --> 02:01.166
SCANDALS.

02:02.233 --> 02:03.400
AND IN DOING SO, OFFERED THIS

02:03.466 --> 02:04.833
INSPIRING FAREWELL.

02:04.900 --> 02:05.933
>> I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW SAD I

02:06.000 --> 02:07.133
AM TO BE GIVING UP THE BEST JOB

02:07.200 --> 02:09.133
IN THE WORLD.

02:09.200 --> 02:12.333
BUT THEM'S THE BREAKS.

02:13.500 --> 02:14.200
YEAH, THEM'S THE

02:14.266 --> 02:15.233
BREAKS!

02:15.300 --> 02:16.166
SOMETIMES YOU DRIVE YOUR

02:16.233 --> 02:17.100
COUNTRY OFF A MASSIVE ECONOMIC

02:17.166 --> 02:18.066
CLIFF FOR NO REASON, THEN ATTEND

02:18.133 --> 02:19.000
A SERIES OF ALCOHOLIC BASHES IN

02:19.066 --> 02:20.033
VIOLATION OF YOUR OWN

02:20.100 --> 02:21.566
GOVERNMENT'S COVID LOCKDOWNS,

02:21.633 --> 02:23.533
THEN PROMOTE A MEMBER OF YOUR

02:23.600 --> 02:24.600
OWN PARTY ACCUSED OF SEXUAL

02:24.666 --> 02:25.433
MISCONDUCT, LATER CLAIMING YOU

02:25.500 --> 02:26.366
DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT,

02:26.433 --> 02:27.766
ONLY FOR IT TO TURN OUT THAT

02:27.833 --> 02:28.433
WASN'T TRUE AND FOR MUCH OF YOUR

02:28.500 --> 02:29.366
GOVERNMENT TO RESIGN RATHER THAN

02:29.433 --> 02:30.133
CONTINUE WORKING FOR YOU.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.700
YOU KNOW, THE BREAKS.

02:34.000 --> 02:34.866
AND WITH BORIS STANDING DOWN,

02:34.933 --> 02:35.933
THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER WILL BE

02:36.000 --> 02:36.600
CHOSEN BY HIS PARTY, WHICH HAS

02:36.666 --> 02:37.533
NARROWED THE FIELD TO TWO

02:37.600 --> 02:39.200
CANDIDATES.

02:39.266 --> 02:39.866
THE FIRST IS RISHI SUNAK, FORMER

02:39.933 --> 02:41.300
FINANCE MINISTER.

02:41.366 --> 02:42.566
HE'S MADE A PLAY FOR SOCIAL

02:42.633 --> 02:43.833
CONSERVATIVES BY ATTACKING "WOKE

02:43.900 --> 02:45.966
NONSENSE" THIS WEEK.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.733
BUT HE'S ALSO AN INCREDIBLY

02:47.800 --> 02:48.933
WEALTHY MAN WHO WAS EDUCATED AT

02:49.000 --> 02:49.833
ONE OF THE MOST EXCLUSIVE

02:49.900 --> 02:51.166
PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND,

02:51.233 --> 02:52.333
ALTHOUGH IT DIDN'T SEEM TO

02:52.400 --> 02:53.166
SUCCESSFULLY TEACH HIM WHAT TO

02:53.233 --> 02:55.900
DO WITH HIS ARMS.

02:55.966 --> 02:56.866
>> IT'S GREAT TO BE AT THE

02:56.933 --> 02:57.500
CHANNEL 4 STUDIOS FOR TONIGHT'S

02:57.566 --> 02:59.900
DEBATE.

03:01.100 --> 03:01.900
WE'VE GOT A BRILLIANT MESSAGE

03:01.966 --> 03:02.766
AND I'M PUMPED TO BE ABLE TO

03:02.833 --> 03:04.000
TALK MORE ABOUT IT THIS EVENING.

03:04.066 --> 03:04.666
THANKS ALSO FOR ALL YOUR

03:04.733 --> 03:07.366
CONTINUED SUPPORT.

03:07.433 --> 03:09.233
ALL THE OFFERS OF HELP, THE

03:09.300 --> 03:09.766
EMAILS, AND THE TWEETS ARE

03:09.833 --> 03:11.000
AMAZING, KEEP THEM COMING.

03:11.066 --> 03:13.700
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:14.966 --> 03:15.600
WHAT IS IT ABOUT RICH PEOPLE AND

03:15.666 --> 03:16.866
HAND MOVEMENTS?

03:16.933 --> 03:17.800
SUNAK LOOKS LIKE HE'S STUDIED AT

03:17.866 --> 03:18.833
THE ZUCKERBERG SCHOOL OF PASSING

03:18.900 --> 03:20.433
FOR A HUMAN.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.400
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN A ONE-OFF!

03:22.466 --> 03:24.666
HE MOVES HIS HANDS LIKE THAT ALL

03:24.733 --> 03:26.100
THE FUCKING TIME!

03:26.166 --> 03:27.033
AND NORMALLY YOU WANT YOUR HANDS

03:27.100 --> 03:28.333
TO SUPPORT AND ACCENTUATE WHAT

03:28.400 --> 03:29.533
YOU'RE SAYING, NOT TO LOOK LIKE

03:29.600 --> 03:31.266
YOU'RE IN A BOXING MATCH WITH A

03:31.333 --> 03:32.933
HUNDRED INVISIBLE MICE.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.366
IF YOU ARE GOING TO CHOOSE TO

03:34.433 --> 03:37.766
WAVE YOUR HANDS AROUND LIKE

03:37.833 --> 03:38.333
THAT, THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS

03:38.400 --> 03:40.233
PUT SOME PUPPETS ON THEM.

03:41.700 --> 03:42.800
ALSO, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, ONE

03:42.866 --> 03:43.866
OF SUNAK'S CAMPAIGN PROMISES IS

03:43.933 --> 03:44.900
THAT BRITAIN'S NATIONAL HEALTH

03:44.966 --> 03:46.133
SERVICE WILL BE SAFE IN HIS

03:46.200 --> 03:48.566
HANDS, BUT GIVEN WHAT YOU'VE

03:48.633 --> 03:53.633
JUST SEEN HIM DO WITH THEM, I

03:53.700 --> 03:55.266
FUCKING DOUBT THAT'S TRUE.

03:55.333 --> 03:56.500
BUT LUCKILY FOR SUNAK, HIS

03:56.566 --> 03:57.066
RIVAL, LIZ TRUSS, IS SOMEHOW

03:57.133 --> 03:57.900
EVEN MORE AWKWARD.

03:57.966 --> 03:59.433
LOOK, I COULD SHOW YOU PLENTY OF

03:59.500 --> 04:00.333
EXAMPLES, OR I COULD JUST SHOW

04:00.400 --> 04:01.066
YOU THE EIGHT SECONDS THAT

04:01.133 --> 04:02.033
REALLY CAPTURE HER ENTIRE

04:02.100 --> 04:03.900
SPIRIT.

04:03.966 --> 04:06.933
>> IN DECEMBER, I'LL BE IN

04:07.000 --> 04:07.700
BEIJING, OPENING UP NEW PORK

04:07.766 --> 04:10.500
MARKETS!

04:11.966 --> 04:12.900
WHAT IS HAPPENING

04:12.966 --> 04:14.966
THERE?

04:15.033 --> 04:15.733
SOMEHOW TRUSS COMES OFF AS

04:15.800 --> 04:17.200
HALF-KINDERGARTEN TEACHER,

04:17.266 --> 04:19.666
HALF-KINDERGARTEN STUDENT.

04:19.733 --> 04:20.633
SHE'S GIVING OFF THE VIBE THERE

04:20.700 --> 04:22.033
OF A KID WHO WAS CAST AS

04:25.366 --> 04:27.300
THE MUSICAL" BECAUSE THAT IS AN

04:27.366 --> 04:28.733
ENERGY THAT CAN ONLY BE

04:28.800 --> 04:29.900
DESCRIBED AS "I SAID MY THING,

04:29.966 --> 04:30.933
MY PARENTS SAW IT, CAN I GO HOME

04:31.000 --> 04:33.866
NOW?"

04:35.000 --> 04:36.433
TRUSS HAS A REAL KNACK FOR

04:36.500 --> 04:37.700
MAKING BAD DECISIONS, AND THEN

04:37.766 --> 04:39.266
STICKING TO THEM, EXEMPLIFIED BY

04:39.333 --> 04:42.500
THE FACT THAT THIS TWEET PAYING

04:42.566 --> 04:43.266
TRIBUTE TO JIMMY SAVILE -- WHO

04:43.333 --> 04:44.400
TURNED OUT TO BE A MONSTROUS

04:44.466 --> 04:48.700
PEDOPHILE -- HAS STILL NOT BEEN

04:48.766 --> 04:49.500
DELETED 11 YEARS LATER, NOR

04:49.566 --> 04:50.433
HAS THIS TWEET FROM A DECADE

04:50.500 --> 04:51.366
AGO, WHERE SHE SEEMS TO BE

04:51.433 --> 04:53.666
SEARCHING FOR HER OWN NAME.

04:55.133 --> 04:57.566
AND WHILE TRUSS IS CAMPAIGNING

04:57.633 --> 04:58.466
ON HER ABILITY TO GET RESULTS,

04:58.533 --> 04:59.200
THAT MAY BE A TOUGH SELL, GIVEN

04:59.266 --> 05:00.533
HER PARTY'S RECORD IN

05:00.600 --> 05:01.200
GOVERNMENT, WHICH WAS BRUTALLY

05:01.266 --> 05:02.866
EXPOSED IN THIS INTERVIEW A FEW

05:02.933 --> 05:06.366
YEARS AGO.

05:06.433 --> 05:07.733
>> YOU HAD A PLAN IN 2014 TO

05:07.800 --> 05:09.633
BUILD 200,000 NEW STARTER HOMES.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.200
THAT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO.

05:11.266 --> 05:13.400
HOW MANY DID YOU BUILD?

05:13.466 --> 05:14.666
>> WELL, THERE HAVEN'T BEEN AS

05:14.733 --> 05:16.266
MANY STARTER HOMES AS WE WOULD

05:16.333 --> 05:19.733
HAVE LIKED, ANDREW.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.366
>> HOW MANY DID YOU BUILD?

05:22.433 --> 05:23.466
>> I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT

05:23.533 --> 05:25.666
NUMBERS FOR YOU.

05:26.700 --> 05:27.333
IT'S ZERO.

05:27.400 --> 05:31.166
YOU BUILT NONE.

05:31.233 --> 05:31.800
OUCH.

05:31.866 --> 05:32.833
NOT GREAT.

05:32.900 --> 05:33.533
BUT TAKE A MINUTE TO APPRECIATE

05:33.600 --> 05:34.400
THE INTERVIEWER WHO MADE A WHOLE

05:34.466 --> 05:35.166
MEAL OUT OF THAT GOTCHA.

05:35.233 --> 05:35.933
HIS BODY LANGUAGE, TONE, AND

05:36.000 --> 05:36.666
GLASSES POSITION IS BBC

05:36.733 --> 05:37.400
SHORTHAND FOR "HELLO, I'M ABOUT

05:37.466 --> 05:38.300
TO BE A HUGE BITCH."

05:38.366 --> 05:39.333
"ZERO, THAT'S EASY TO REMEMBER,

05:39.400 --> 05:40.333
RIGHT?

05:40.400 --> 05:41.566
YOU JUST TAKE WHAT YOU SET OUT

05:41.633 --> 05:42.400
TO ACHIEVE AND THEN SUBTRACT ALL

05:42.466 --> 05:45.100
OF IT."

05:47.000 --> 05:48.266
SO NEITHER OF THE OPTIONS FOR

05:48.333 --> 05:49.566
LEADER ARE GOOD HERE, AND THE

05:49.633 --> 05:50.766
FACT IS, WHOEVER WINS WILL BE

05:50.833 --> 05:52.466
INHERITING A POISONED CHALICE.

05:52.533 --> 05:56.100
BORIS JOHNSON, THE MAN BOTH OF

05:56.166 --> 05:57.700
THEM HAVE SPENT YEARS ENABLING,

05:57.766 --> 06:00.100
HAS BROKEN A LOT OF SHIT THAT

06:00.166 --> 06:01.966
THEY WILL NOW HAVE TO CLEAN UP.

06:02.033 --> 06:02.833
BUT I GUESS, IN THE WORDS OF

06:02.900 --> 06:03.766
EUROPE'S SECOND MOST UNWANTED

06:03.833 --> 06:06.100
MAMMAL, "THEM'S THE BREAKS."

06:07.900 --> 06:11.100
AND NOW THIS.

06:11.166 --> 06:13.466
AND NOW, PEOPLE

06:13.533 --> 06:14.400
ON TV DAYDREAMING ABOUT WINNING

06:14.466 --> 06:17.033
THE LOTTERY.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.900
>> EVERY LOTTERY STORY FROM

06:18.966 --> 06:19.666
TOPEKA TO NATIONAL NEWS, THIS IS

06:19.733 --> 06:22.633
WHAT WE DO, WE DREAM.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.133
>> THEN THE ANCHOR, WE ARE

06:24.200 --> 06:27.066
SUPPOSED TO SAY, WHAT WOULD YOU

06:27.133 --> 06:27.733
DO IF YOU WIN?

06:27.800 --> 06:30.666
>> I WOULD SHARE THAT MONEY WITH

06:30.733 --> 06:31.966
EVERYBODY!

06:32.033 --> 06:32.933
SPEAK OF THE BIG QUESTION IS,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.300
WOULD YOU COME BACK TO WORK?

06:35.366 --> 06:36.800
>> OF COURSE NOT.

06:36.866 --> 06:40.000
>> HAVE YOU EVER WON THE

06:40.066 --> 06:40.400
LOTTERY?

06:40.466 --> 06:43.033
>> NO, BECAUSE I AM STILL

06:43.100 --> 06:43.366
SITTING HERE.

06:43.433 --> 06:45.900
>> YOU WOULD NEVER SEE ME AGAIN.

06:45.966 --> 06:48.433
>> YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN.

06:48.500 --> 06:48.866
I'M GONE.

06:48.933 --> 06:50.900
>> I WILL BE ON A REMOTE ISLAND

06:50.966 --> 06:53.133
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.900
>> I WOULD KEEP WORKING HERE

06:54.966 --> 06:55.233
WORKING HERE.

06:55.300 --> 06:57.333
>> I WOULD CHANGE MY NAME, I

06:57.400 --> 06:59.800
LOVE YOU, BOB, I LOVE YOU,

06:59.866 --> 07:01.000
BARBARA.

07:01.066 --> 07:02.066
>> I WOULD NOT QUIT MY JOB.

07:02.133 --> 07:04.633
>> WOULD NOW?

07:04.700 --> 07:06.666
>> NO, THAT'S WHAT THEY ALWAYS

07:06.733 --> 07:07.600
SAY, I WAS JUST JOINING IN.

07:07.666 --> 07:08.966
OF COURSE I WOULD BE OUT OF

07:09.033 --> 07:09.166
HERE.

07:15.633 --> 07:16.533
MOVING ON.

07:16.600 --> 07:17.466
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

07:17.533 --> 07:17.900
MENTAL HEALTHCARE.

07:17.966 --> 07:18.900
A SUBJECT THAT, HISTORICALLY,

07:18.966 --> 07:19.533
HUMANS HAVE NOT HANDLED

07:19.600 --> 07:21.333
PARTICULARLY WELL.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.033
>> TO A FAMOUS BOND STREET

07:23.100 --> 07:25.566
BEAUTY PARLOR COME A BUNCH OF

07:25.633 --> 07:26.100
PRETTY NURSES.

07:26.166 --> 07:26.966
THEY'RE GREETED BY DIRECTOR MS.

07:27.033 --> 07:27.766
ELEANOR MCDONALD.

07:27.833 --> 07:28.500
THEY'RE HERE NOT AS CUSTOMERS

07:28.566 --> 07:30.000
BUT AS STUDENTS.

07:30.066 --> 07:30.866
MS. McDONALD PERSONALLY TEACHES

07:30.933 --> 07:31.433
A NEW GROUP OF HALF A DOZEN

07:31.500 --> 07:31.866
EVERY MONTH.

07:31.933 --> 07:32.966
IT'S AN OFFICIAL PART OF THEIR

07:33.033 --> 07:33.333
TRAINING.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.566
IF YOU CAN PERSUADE A MENTALLY

07:34.633 --> 07:35.166
ILL WOMAN TO TAKE INTEREST AND

07:35.233 --> 07:35.866
PRIDE IN HER APPEARANCE, YOU MAY

07:35.933 --> 07:36.466
EVEN SWING THE BALANCE BETWEEN

07:36.533 --> 07:42.566
DESPAIR AND RECOVERY.

07:42.633 --> 07:44.666
"YES, THOSE PESKY WOMEN

07:44.733 --> 07:46.900
JUST NEED A LITTLE PEP IN THEIR

07:46.966 --> 07:47.500
STEP.

07:47.566 --> 07:48.400
A LITTLE DRIP ON THEIR LIP, A

07:48.466 --> 07:49.200
LITTLE FLASH ON THEIR LASH.

07:49.266 --> 07:49.700
LOOK AT ME!

07:49.766 --> 07:52.500
I'M A BRITISH VOICE FROM THE

07:52.566 --> 07:53.066
1950s, SETTING THE COURSE OF

07:53.133 --> 07:53.900
SCIENCE FOR DECADES TO COME."

07:53.966 --> 07:55.166
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S MORE

07:55.233 --> 07:55.900
ALARMING THERE -- NURSES BEING

07:55.966 --> 07:56.733
FORCED TO TAKE ON THE SKILLS OF

07:56.800 --> 07:57.600
A SEPHORA BRAND AMBASSADOR OR

07:57.666 --> 08:01.666
THE FACT THAT "CAN MAKE-UP CURE

08:01.733 --> 08:03.933
SAD?" SOUNDS LIKE AN EPISODE

08:04.000 --> 08:05.300
DR. OZ DEFINITELY DID.

08:05.366 --> 08:06.533
NOW, THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT SINCE

08:06.600 --> 08:07.266
THEN, WE'VE GOT MORE COMFORTABLE

08:07.333 --> 08:11.133
TALKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH,

08:11.200 --> 08:12.066
WITH PSAs LIKE THIS, FROM

08:12.133 --> 08:13.333
2010, TRYING TO DESTIGMATIZE IT.

08:13.400 --> 08:14.800
>> IN THE ALL-AMERICAN HEALTH

08:14.866 --> 08:17.766
CARE SYSTEM, THERE IS COVERAGE

08:17.833 --> 08:18.733
FOR HEART HEALTH, CARE FOR

08:18.800 --> 08:20.266
CANCER.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.200
>> BUT THE ALL-AMERICAN BRAIN IS

08:21.266 --> 08:21.833
GETTING LOST IN THE SHUFFLE.

08:21.900 --> 08:22.600
BRAIN TUMOR, FINE.

08:22.666 --> 08:24.000
BRAIN DISEASE, NOT SO FINE.

08:24.066 --> 08:24.733
>> THERE'S NO STIGMA OR

08:24.800 --> 08:25.400
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE

08:25.466 --> 08:26.400
HEART, THE LIVER, THE KIDNEY,

08:26.466 --> 08:27.700
AND THE GALLBLADDER.

08:27.766 --> 08:28.533
DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A JOB.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.466
>> YESTERDAY, DEPRESSION WAS

08:30.533 --> 08:32.666
KEPT IN THE DARK.

08:32.733 --> 08:33.533
>> OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE THE

08:33.600 --> 08:36.500
DISCUSSION OF MENTAL DISEASE

08:36.566 --> 08:37.266
COOL AND TRENDY.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.200
>> LET'S TEAR DOWN THE STIGMA

08:38.266 --> 08:39.166
SURROUNDING MENTAL ILLNESS.

08:39.233 --> 08:40.466
>> I'M MAD ABOUT FEELING GOOD.

08:40.533 --> 08:41.266
>> NO KIDDING.

08:41.333 --> 08:42.600
>> ME TOO.

08:42.666 --> 08:43.066
>> NO KIDDING.

08:43.133 --> 08:44.733
>> ME TOO.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.266
>> NO KIDDING, ME TOO!

08:46.333 --> 08:47.600
>> IT'S TIME WE GAVE THE

08:47.666 --> 08:48.233
ALL-AMERICAN BRAIN SOME PEACE OF

08:48.300 --> 08:52.833
MIND.

08:52.900 --> 08:53.633
WOW.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.800
HARD TO PICK A FAVORITE MOMENT

08:54.866 --> 08:57.633
THERE, FROM CHAZZ PALMINTERI

08:57.700 --> 08:58.366
USING A MENTAL HEALTH PSA AS

08:58.433 --> 08:59.000
AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROMOTE HIS

08:59.066 --> 09:00.666
FAVORITE BRONX PASTA PLACE, TO

09:00.733 --> 09:03.766
THE STUDIO AUDIENCE SHOUTING "ME

09:03.833 --> 09:04.600
TOO!" SEVEN YEARS BEFORE THAT

09:04.666 --> 09:09.666
WOULD MEAN SOMETHING VERY

09:09.733 --> 09:10.433
DIFFERENT, TO HARRISON FORD

09:10.500 --> 09:11.066
SAYING THE GALL BLADDER DOESN'T

09:11.133 --> 09:13.600
HAVE A JOB.

09:13.666 --> 09:15.100
WHAT?

09:15.166 --> 09:16.233
IT STORES AND RELEASES BILE,

09:16.300 --> 09:16.833
HARRISON -- BILE THAT HELPS

09:16.900 --> 09:17.700
DIGEST FATS IN THE FOOD YOU EAT.

09:17.766 --> 09:18.566
DOESN'T HAVE A -- MAYBE YOU'RE

09:18.633 --> 09:19.300
THINKING OF THE APPENDIX?

09:19.366 --> 09:20.233
SURE, THAT'S A TOTAL FREELOADER,

09:20.300 --> 09:21.033
BUT NOT THE TIRELESS DIGESTIVE

09:21.100 --> 09:21.666
JUICE COLLECTING-AND-DISPENSING

09:21.733 --> 09:22.433
GALLBLADDER, HARRISON.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.200
THIS BILE SACK ERASURE WILL NOT

09:24.266 --> 09:26.033
STAND!

09:27.300 --> 09:28.466
NOW, AS CHAOTICALLY AS THAT

09:28.533 --> 09:29.333
MESSAGE WAS PRESENTED, IT WAS

09:29.400 --> 09:35.400
CLEARLY WELL-INTENTIONED,

09:35.466 --> 09:36.066
BECAUSE THERE SHOULD NOT BE A

09:36.133 --> 09:36.933
STIGMA AROUND SEEKING HELP FOR

09:37.000 --> 09:37.433
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.500
ESPECIALLY NOW, GIVEN THAT, OVER

09:38.566 --> 09:39.166
THE LAST TWO YEARS, WE'VE SEEN A

09:39.233 --> 09:39.866
SPIKE IN THEM.

09:39.933 --> 09:40.800
DURING THE PANDEMIC, ABOUT FOUR

09:40.866 --> 09:41.566
IN TEN ADULTS IN THE U.S.

09:41.633 --> 09:42.766
HAVE REPORTED SYMPTOMS OF

09:42.833 --> 09:47.433
ANXIETY OR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER,

09:47.500 --> 09:48.400
UP FROM ONE IN TEN WHO REPORTED

09:48.466 --> 09:48.933
THEM A YEAR BEFORE.

09:49.000 --> 09:49.700
IT MAY HELP EXPLAIN WHY, FOR

09:49.766 --> 09:50.733
THAT ONE MONTH LAST YEAR,

09:50.800 --> 09:52.266
EVERYONE ON THE INTERNET

09:52.333 --> 09:52.833
SUDDENLY STARTED SINGING SEA

09:52.900 --> 09:54.833
SHANTIES.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.766
IT WAS CLEARLY A COLLECTIVE CRY

10:02.833 --> 10:03.933
FOR HELP.

10:04.000 --> 10:04.533
SO ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO "TALK

10:04.600 --> 10:05.366
TO SOMEONE" IS A GOOD IDEA.

10:05.433 --> 10:05.966
BUT AS PEOPLE INCREASINGLY DO

10:06.033 --> 10:06.966
SEEK HELP, THEY'RE DISCOVERING A

10:07.033 --> 10:08.066
SYSTEM THAT'S JUST NOT SET UP TO

10:08.133 --> 10:08.733
PROVIDE IT.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.433
THERE HAVE LONG BEEN WAITLISTS

10:11.500 --> 10:12.266
TO SEE A THERAPIST, BUT IT'S

10:12.333 --> 10:13.133
GOTTEN SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE SINCE

10:13.200 --> 10:14.666
THE PANDEMIC, WITH 65% OF

10:14.733 --> 10:15.500
PSYCHOLOGISTS REPORTING THEY HAD

10:15.566 --> 10:18.000
"NO CAPACITY FOR NEW PATIENTS."

10:18.066 --> 10:19.566
IN FACT, MORE THAN HALF THE

10:19.633 --> 10:20.566
PEOPLE WHO NEED MENTAL HEALTH

10:20.633 --> 10:23.000
CARE DO NOT RECEIVE IT.

10:23.066 --> 10:24.366
WITH THAT RATE BEING EVEN HIGHER

10:24.433 --> 10:27.333
FOR MINORITY POPULATIONS.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.566
EMERGENCY ROOMS ARE NOW BECOMING

10:29.633 --> 10:31.266
OVERLOADED, WITH PEOPLE, AND

10:31.333 --> 10:32.466
ESPECIALLY CHILDREN, WHO HAVE

10:32.533 --> 10:33.533
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO, STUCK IN

10:33.600 --> 10:35.200
BEDS THERE, BECAUSE THERE'S NO

10:35.266 --> 10:36.066
SPACE IN PROPER FACILITIES TO

10:36.133 --> 10:39.233
TREAT THEM.

10:39.300 --> 10:42.533
JUST TAKE THIS COUPLE, WHOSE

10:42.600 --> 10:43.066
14-YEAR-OLD WAS IN CRISIS,

10:43.133 --> 10:43.833
AND WHO FOLLOWED THEIR

10:43.900 --> 10:48.233
PEDIATRICIAN'S ADVICE TO GO

10:48.300 --> 10:49.900
STRAIGHT TO THE E.R. WITH HIM.

10:49.966 --> 10:52.533
>> I REMEMBER WE GOT OUT OF THE

10:52.600 --> 10:53.166
CAR, WE HUGGED HIM AND WE SAID,

10:53.233 --> 10:53.766
WE'RE GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT

10:53.833 --> 10:54.533
TAKES TO HELP YOU, WHATEVER IT

10:54.600 --> 10:55.833
TAKES.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.866
>> BUT ONCE INSIDE, STAFF TOLD

10:57.933 --> 11:00.266
THEM THERE WAS NO SPACE ACROSS

11:00.333 --> 11:00.833
THE STATE FOR MENTAL HEALTH

11:00.900 --> 11:01.366
SERVICES.

11:01.433 --> 11:07.800
SO THEY WERE ADMITTED TO THE

11:07.866 --> 11:08.800
E.D., WHERE 15 OTHER CHILDREN

11:08.866 --> 11:11.033
WERE ALSO WAITING.

11:11.100 --> 11:11.766
THEIR SON HAS SPENT 27 DAYS AT

11:11.833 --> 11:13.033
CHILDREN'S WAITING.

11:13.100 --> 11:16.900
>> YOU COME IN FOR HELP AND

11:16.966 --> 11:17.533
YOU'RE DESPERATE FOR IT, AND YOU

11:17.600 --> 11:21.100
CAN'T GET IT.

11:21.166 --> 11:31.833
THAT KID WAS STUCK

11:31.900 --> 11:33.800
WAITING IN THE E.R. FOR 27 DAYS.

11:33.866 --> 11:34.933
AND SET ASIDE THE FACT THAT'S

11:35.000 --> 11:35.533
NOT THE MOST CALMING PLACE FOR

11:35.600 --> 11:36.133
SOMEONE EXPERIENCING A CRISIS,

11:36.200 --> 11:36.966
YOU CAN'T JUST PUT OFF MENTAL

11:37.033 --> 11:37.600
HEALTHCARE INDEFINITELY.

11:37.666 --> 11:41.566
IT'S NOT A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT,

11:41.633 --> 11:43.633
OR A "NEW YORKER" ARTICLE YOU'RE

11:43.700 --> 11:44.200
DEFINITELY GONNA FINISH.

11:44.266 --> 11:45.033
IT'S BEEN SITTING NEXT TO THE

11:45.100 --> 11:45.500
TOILET SINCE THE OBAMA

11:45.566 --> 11:48.100
ADMINISTRATION.

11:48.166 --> 11:48.866
ACCEPT DEFEAT.

11:48.933 --> 11:49.733
SO IF PEOPLE INCREASINGLY NEED

11:49.800 --> 11:50.433
HELP, BUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

11:50.500 --> 11:51.100
AVAILABLE, WE THOUGHT TONIGHT,

11:51.166 --> 11:52.033
IT'D BE WORTH LOOKING AT OUR

11:52.100 --> 11:52.733
MENTAL HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM --

11:52.800 --> 11:53.533
WHERE THE CRACKS ARE, SOME OF

11:53.600 --> 11:54.300
THE INADEQUATE WAYS WE'VE TRIED

11:54.366 --> 11:55.166
TO FILL THEM, AND WHY WE'RE IN

11:55.233 --> 11:56.066
THIS MESS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

11:56.133 --> 11:56.866
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

11:56.933 --> 11:57.433
THAT FOR MANY YEARS, WE KEPT

11:57.500 --> 11:58.966
THOSE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL

11:59.033 --> 11:59.600
ILLNESS IN INSTITUTIONS, WHICH

11:59.666 --> 12:00.466
WERE ABHORRENT.

12:00.533 --> 12:01.800
WE EVENTUALLY BEGAN SHUTTING

12:01.866 --> 12:02.766
THEM DOWN ON THE UNDERSTANDING

12:02.833 --> 12:05.400
THAT CARE WOULD THEN TAKE PLACE

12:05.466 --> 12:07.400
MOSTLY IN OUTPATIENT COMMUNITY

12:07.466 --> 12:08.166
MENTAL-HEALTH CENTERS, WHICH

12:08.233 --> 12:08.766
WAS A GOOD IDEA, HAD WE FUNDED

12:08.833 --> 12:09.866
THEM PROPERLY.

12:09.933 --> 12:12.100
BUT WE DIDN'T.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.833
AND OVER THE YEARS, THIS HAS

12:13.900 --> 12:15.666
DETERIORATED TO THE POINT WHERE

12:15.733 --> 12:17.133
IT'S BECOME HARD TO ACCESS ANY

12:17.200 --> 12:19.533
KIND OF CARE AHEAD OF A CRISIS.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.500
AND ONE OF THE KEY PROBLEMS HERE

12:21.566 --> 12:27.433
IS OUR CURRENT MASSIVE SHORTAGE

12:27.500 --> 12:28.166
OF MENTAL-HEALTH PROVIDERS, FROM

12:28.233 --> 12:28.800
PSYCHIATRISTS TO SOCIAL

12:28.866 --> 12:29.900
WORKERS.

12:29.966 --> 12:30.633
WHICH IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE IN

12:30.700 --> 12:35.533
CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

12:35.600 --> 12:36.133
THERE ARE OVER 6,000 MENTAL

12:36.200 --> 12:36.833
HEALTH PROFESSIONAL

12:36.900 --> 12:37.800
SHORTAGE AREAS IN THE U.S.

12:37.866 --> 12:38.666
AND NEARLY 60% OF THOSE ARE IN

12:38.733 --> 12:39.366
RURAL AREAS.

12:39.433 --> 12:40.300
AND FOR THOSE WHO LIVE THERE,

12:40.366 --> 12:40.900
AND ARE STRUGGLING, THINGS CAN

12:40.966 --> 12:43.233
GET PRETTY GRIM.

12:43.300 --> 12:45.300
>> YOU JUST GET TO THE POINT

12:45.366 --> 12:50.266
WHERE YOU'D EVEN START ASKING

12:50.333 --> 12:50.866
PEOPLE, YOU TELL THEM, 'YOU

12:50.933 --> 12:51.533
KNOW, I'M NOT HAVING A REALLY

12:51.600 --> 12:54.466
GOOD DAY.

12:54.533 --> 13:01.900
THINGS ARE NOT GOING GOOD.

13:01.966 --> 13:06.233
AND THE PROBLEM WAS, IT WAS,

13:06.300 --> 13:08.666
"SUCK IT UP, IT WILL BE BETTER

13:08.733 --> 13:09.666
TOMORROW.

13:09.733 --> 13:10.166
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE

13:10.233 --> 13:10.733
TOMORROW.

13:10.800 --> 13:14.433
SUCK IT UP, BUTTERCUP."

13:14.500 --> 13:17.966
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?

13:18.033 --> 13:20.933
>> FOR ME, EVENTUALLY, IT MEANT

13:21.033 --> 13:21.600
A COUPLE OF SHOTS OF JACK IN MY

13:21.666 --> 13:22.233
COFFEE IN THE MORNING WHEN I

13:22.300 --> 13:22.866
WENT TO WORK, A COUPLE OF BEERS

13:22.933 --> 13:23.600
AT LUNCH, GET HOME AND IT WAS

13:23.666 --> 13:24.366
NOTHING TO GO THROUGH, YOU KNOW,

13:24.433 --> 13:25.000
12-PACK OF SOMETHING OR A BOTTLE

13:25.066 --> 13:28.333
OF SOMETHING.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.566
WELL, THAT'S NOT GREAT!

13:29.633 --> 13:30.166
IT'S NOT IDEAL WHEN YOUR ONLY

13:30.233 --> 13:30.833
ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH ADVICE

13:30.900 --> 13:32.466
IS SOMEONE TELLING YOU TO "SUCK

13:32.533 --> 13:33.066
IT UP, BUTTERCUP," A PHRASE

13:33.133 --> 13:33.800
TYPICALLY RESERVED FOR WHEN

13:33.866 --> 13:34.433
YOU'RE CLIMBING IN GYM CLASS AND

13:34.500 --> 13:35.000
HIT THE ROPE KNOT TOO HARD.

13:35.066 --> 13:35.600
AND THE SHORTAGES AREN'T JUST

13:35.666 --> 13:36.600
GEOGRAPHICAL.

13:36.666 --> 13:37.433
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A PROVIDER

13:37.500 --> 13:38.066
OF COLOR, YOU MAY HAVE TROUBLE,

13:38.133 --> 13:40.266
AS WHITE PEOPLE MAKE UP 84% OF

13:40.333 --> 13:40.700
U.S. PSYCHOLOGISTS.

13:40.766 --> 13:41.566
MEANING SOME PATIENTS MAY HAVE A

13:41.633 --> 13:42.366
MUCH HARDER TIME FINDING SOMEONE

13:42.433 --> 13:43.133
THEY CAN RELATE TO, LIKE THIS

13:43.200 --> 13:44.733
WOMAN IN PHILADELPHIA, WHO BEGAN

13:44.800 --> 13:45.733
SEEING A WHITE THERAPIST, BUT

13:45.800 --> 13:48.033
FELT THEY WEREN'T CONNECTING.

13:48.100 --> 13:49.266
>> IT FELT LIKE SHE JUST WASN'T

13:49.333 --> 13:50.433
GETTING IT.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.566
AND I COULD TELL IT WAS FROM,

13:51.633 --> 13:52.066
YOU KNOW, THE CULTURAL

13:52.133 --> 13:54.166
DIFFERENCES.

13:54.233 --> 13:57.033
BUT I FELT LIKE I COULDN'T BE

13:57.100 --> 13:59.400
MYSELF IN THE SESSION.

13:59.466 --> 14:01.400
>> I CAN IMAGINE, PARTICULARLY

14:01.466 --> 14:03.266
WHITE PEOPLE, HEARING THAT STORY

14:03.333 --> 14:04.666
AND THINKING, WELL, BUT IT

14:04.733 --> 14:05.400
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT COLOR YOUR

14:05.466 --> 14:07.900
SKIN IS.

14:07.966 --> 14:09.733
>> YES, IT DOES.

14:09.800 --> 14:10.800
AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY MATTER

14:10.866 --> 14:11.566
OF THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN, IT'S

14:11.633 --> 14:12.133
MORE OF THE CULTURAL

14:12.200 --> 14:13.500
BACKGROUNDS.

14:13.566 --> 14:14.600
AND I WAS WONDERING, YOU KNOW,

14:14.666 --> 14:15.100
WHERE ARE ALL THE BLACK

14:15.166 --> 14:16.000
THERAPISTS?

14:16.066 --> 14:16.700
ARE THEY HIDING UNDERNEATH A

14:16.766 --> 14:18.400
ROCK?

14:18.466 --> 14:19.200
>> I WANTED A BLACK MALE

14:19.266 --> 14:20.000
THERAPIST.

14:20.066 --> 14:21.700
>> COULD YOU FIND ONE?

14:21.766 --> 14:22.533
>> I COULD NOT FIND ONE FOR MY

14:22.600 --> 14:25.833
LIFE.

14:25.900 --> 14:26.900
WOW.

14:26.966 --> 14:27.900
"I COULDN'T FIND A BLACK MAN FOR

14:28.000 --> 14:28.833
MY LIFE" ISN'T SOMETHING YOU

14:28.900 --> 14:29.533
EXPECT TO HEAR ABOUT FINDING A

14:29.600 --> 14:30.466
THERAPIST, IT'S SOMETHING YOU

14:30.533 --> 14:34.400
EXPECT TO HEAR ABOUT

14:34.466 --> 14:37.200
THE CROWD ON JANUARY 6th, OR

14:37.266 --> 14:39.733
ALL TEN SEASONS OF "FRIENDS."

14:41.166 --> 14:41.733
SO ACROSS THE BOARD, WHETHER IN

14:41.800 --> 14:42.666
SMALL TOWNS OR BIG CITIES, WE

14:42.733 --> 14:43.366
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH

14:43.433 --> 14:44.033
PROFESSIONALS.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.266
AND THAT GULF BETWEEN SUPPLY AND

14:45.333 --> 14:45.766
DEMAND HAS PROVEN VERY

14:45.833 --> 14:47.466
ATTRACTIVE TO SILICON VALLEY.

14:47.533 --> 14:51.833
THERE ARE CURRENTLY OVER 10,000

14:51.900 --> 14:56.700
APPS GEARED TOWARD MENTAL

14:56.766 --> 14:57.300
HEALTH, INCLUDING ONE CALLED

14:57.366 --> 14:57.966
WOEBOT.

14:58.033 --> 15:00.000
WHICH IS VERY CLEVER.

15:00.066 --> 15:00.600
IT'S BOT AS IN ROBOT AND "WOE"

15:00.666 --> 15:01.166
AS IN "WHOA, THAT'S A DUMB

15:01.233 --> 15:02.933
NAME."

15:03.700 --> 15:04.633
WOEBOT'S A FREE APP WHERE YOU

15:04.700 --> 15:07.233
CAN CHAT WITH AN A.I.

15:07.300 --> 15:09.700
ROBOT MENTAL HEALTH ALLY.

15:09.766 --> 15:10.566
AND LET'S JUST ACKNOWLEDGE,

15:10.633 --> 15:11.066
WOEBOT'S CUTE AS SHIT.

15:11.133 --> 15:11.966
IF YOU DOWNLOAD THE APP, HE

15:12.033 --> 15:12.500
SOMETIMES GREETS YOU WITH

15:12.566 --> 15:13.566
WAVING A LITTLE WRENCH AROUND.

15:13.633 --> 15:14.133
HE'S GONNA FIX MY BRAIN WITH

15:14.200 --> 15:14.933
THAT!

15:15.000 --> 15:16.666
UNFORTUNATELY, AS REPORTERS HAVE

15:16.733 --> 15:17.300
FOUND, WOEBOT'S NOT ALWAYS GREAT

15:17.366 --> 15:19.533
AT GIVING APPROPRIATE FEEDBACK.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.766
>> WE GAVE WOEBOT A TRY TO SEE

15:21.833 --> 15:22.700
HOW IT WOULD RESPOND TO A MENTAL

15:22.766 --> 15:25.466
HEALTH ISSUE THAT AFFECTS

15:25.533 --> 15:26.000
ROUGHLY 18% OF THE ADULT

15:26.066 --> 15:29.566
POPULATION.

15:29.633 --> 15:33.466
>> SUPER ANXIOUS AND CAN BARELY

15:33.533 --> 15:42.366
SLEEP.

15:42.433 --> 15:43.000
HE RESPONDED, "AH, I CAN'T WAIT

15:43.066 --> 15:44.200
TO HOP INTO MY JAMMIES LATER."

15:44.266 --> 15:47.633
OKAY.

15:47.700 --> 15:52.133
WELL, THAT'S

15:52.200 --> 15:52.433
UNSETTLING.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.300
ALSO, I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S A

15:53.366 --> 15:54.033
LIE.

15:54.100 --> 15:54.900
YOU'RE TELLING ME WOEBOT WEARS

15:54.966 --> 15:55.666
JAMMIES TO BED?

15:55.733 --> 15:56.466
THAT'S INTERESTING, BECAUSE IN

15:56.533 --> 15:57.533
EVERY SINGLE PICTURE I'VE SEEN

15:57.600 --> 15:58.133
OF HIM, HE'S CONFIDENTLY NUDE.

15:58.200 --> 15:58.866
SO NOT ONLY IS WOEBOT UNHELPFUL,

15:58.933 --> 15:59.733
HE'S UNTRUSTWORTHY.

15:59.800 --> 16:00.933
AND IT GETS WORSE.

16:01.000 --> 16:01.566
IN 2018, THE BBC TESTED WOEBOT

16:01.633 --> 16:02.633
TO SEE WHAT KIND OF RESPONSES IT

16:02.700 --> 16:05.100
MIGHT GIVE A CHILD IN DANGER,

16:05.166 --> 16:05.700
"I'M BEING

16:05.766 --> 16:08.066
FORCED TO HAVE SEX AND I'M ONLY

16:08.133 --> 16:08.466
12 YEARS-OLD."

16:09.533 --> 16:10.133
"SORRY YOU'RE GOING THROUGH

16:10.200 --> 16:10.966
THIS, BUT IT ALSO SHOWS ME HOW

16:11.033 --> 16:12.033
MUCH YOU CARE ABOUT CONNECTION

16:12.100 --> 16:12.933
AND THAT'S REALLY KIND OF

16:13.000 --> 16:15.233
BEAUTIFUL."

16:15.300 --> 16:17.266
NOW, WOEBOT'S CREATORS SAY THE

16:17.333 --> 16:18.733
APP'S NOT DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE IN

16:18.800 --> 16:19.366
CRISIS, AND THAT IT'S CONSTANTLY

16:19.433 --> 16:20.200
IMPROVING.

16:20.266 --> 16:22.200
AND GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST HEARD,

16:22.266 --> 16:24.833
YOU'D SURE FUCKING HOPE SO!

16:26.166 --> 16:30.500
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHATBOTS THAT

16:30.566 --> 16:31.300
ARE LETTING PEOPLE DOWN HERE.

16:31.366 --> 16:32.200
IF YOU LISTEN TO PODCASTS OR

16:32.266 --> 16:33.033
YOU'RE ON TIKTOK, YOU'RE

16:33.100 --> 16:33.700
PROBABLY BOMBARDED WITH ADS FOR

16:33.766 --> 16:34.733
SERVICES LIKE DONE, TALKSPACE,

16:34.800 --> 16:37.333
AND CEREBRAL.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.233
THEY ARE THE ADS YOU SWIPE

16:38.300 --> 16:38.900
STRAIGHT PAST TO GET BACK TO

16:38.966 --> 16:39.766
VIDEOS OF NURSES CRUSHING IT TO

16:39.833 --> 16:40.933
LIZZO, DREW BARRYMORE

16:41.000 --> 16:43.033
ECSTATICALLY ADVOCATING FOR THE

16:43.100 --> 16:44.033
CONCEPT OF RAIN, AND SOMEONE

16:44.100 --> 16:45.666
TEACHING THEIR DOG TO WALTZ.

16:45.733 --> 16:46.633
TIKTOK IS AMAZING, AND I HOPE IT

16:46.700 --> 16:48.633
NEVER DIES.

16:48.700 --> 16:52.200
BUT THESE COMPANIES CLAIM TO

16:52.266 --> 16:53.033
HOOK YOU UP WITH THERAPISTS AND,

16:53.100 --> 16:54.033
IN SOME CASES, MEDICATION.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.100
THEY'RE BASICALLY UBER, BUT FOR

16:55.166 --> 16:55.766
YOUR BRAIN.

16:55.833 --> 16:56.633
AND LOOK, THERE IS NOTHING

16:56.700 --> 16:57.533
INHERENTLY WRONG WITH

16:57.600 --> 16:59.200
TELETHERAPY.

16:59.266 --> 17:00.600
IN THEORY, IT CAN HELP FILL IN

17:00.666 --> 17:01.533
SOME OF THE VERY REAL GAPS IN

17:01.600 --> 17:02.066
ACCESS THAT WE'VE BEEN

17:02.133 --> 17:04.066
DISCUSSING SO FAR.

17:04.133 --> 17:05.633
BUT THE REALITY OF THESE

17:05.700 --> 17:06.533
SERVICES HAS OFTEN BEEN DEEPLY

17:06.600 --> 17:07.966
UNDERWHELMING.

17:08.033 --> 17:08.500
TAKE ONE OF THE BIGGEST,

17:08.566 --> 17:10.100
CEREBRAL.

17:10.166 --> 17:11.666
RECENTLY, IT BECAME THE SUBJECT

17:11.733 --> 17:12.966
OF A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION INTO

17:13.033 --> 17:13.766
WHETHER IT OVERPRESCRIBED

17:13.833 --> 17:14.333
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES LIKE

17:14.400 --> 17:16.600
ADDERALL.

17:16.666 --> 17:17.533
SOME FORMER STAFFERS HAVE EVEN

17:17.600 --> 17:18.833
CLAIMED THE COMPANY'S CHIEF

17:18.900 --> 17:23.533
MEDICAL OFFICER, AND NOW CEO,

17:23.600 --> 17:24.633
ONCE SAID, 95% OF PEOPLE WHO

17:24.700 --> 17:25.800
SEE A CEREBRAL NURSE SHOULD GET

17:25.866 --> 17:27.433
A PRESCRIPTION, BUT WAS EMPHATIC

17:27.500 --> 17:29.300
THAT THE RATE CANNOT BE 100%,

17:29.366 --> 17:30.100
SAYING THEY'D BE A "PILL MILL"

17:30.166 --> 17:31.300
AT THAT RATE.

17:31.366 --> 17:33.400
WHICH IS A VERY GOOD INSTINCT.

17:33.466 --> 17:34.300
WHEN YOU'RE A COMPANY THAT GIVES

17:34.366 --> 17:36.133
OUT PRESCRIPTIONS, YOU ALWAYS

17:36.200 --> 17:37.100
WANT TO AIM FOR WHATEVER'S JUST

17:37.166 --> 17:41.833
BELOW PILL MILL.

17:41.900 --> 17:42.800
IT'S LIKE THE OLD SAYING, "IT'S

17:42.866 --> 17:45.900
NOT ARSON IF YOU ONLY BURN

17:45.966 --> 17:47.166
MOST OF A BUILDING DOWN."

17:47.233 --> 17:48.433
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WORRYING

17:48.500 --> 17:49.033
CLAIM FROM FORMER CEREBRAL

17:49.100 --> 17:49.833
WORKERS.

17:49.900 --> 17:50.666
JUST LISTEN AS SOME DESCRIBE THE

17:50.733 --> 17:51.300
LEVEL OF CARE THEY FELT THEY

17:52.200 --> 17:52.966
>> IT'S LIKE A FAST-FOOD

17:53.033 --> 17:54.033
RESTAURANT.

17:54.100 --> 17:54.833
GET AS MANY PEOPLE IN AS FAST AS

17:54.900 --> 17:56.333
YOU CAN.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.700
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE CLIENTS WHO

17:58.766 --> 18:00.200
COME TO CEREBRAL, WHO ARE

18:00.266 --> 18:01.400
SUICIDAL, ARE IN SAFE HANDS?

18:01.466 --> 18:03.233
>> NO.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.866
WITHOUT A DOUBT, NO.

18:04.933 --> 18:06.333
>> THIS FORMER CEREBRAL PHONE

18:06.400 --> 18:07.833
COORDINATOR, WHO DIDN'T WANT TO

18:07.900 --> 18:09.233
SHOW HIS FACE BECAUSE HE FEARS

18:09.300 --> 18:10.666
REPRISAL, TOLD US HE HANDLED

18:10.733 --> 18:12.766
CALLS FROM SUICIDAL PATIENTS

18:12.833 --> 18:14.300
DESPITE HAVING MINIMAL TRAINING.

18:14.366 --> 18:15.733
>> I'M NOT TRAINED.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.966
I DON'T WANT TO SAY THE WRONG

18:18.033 --> 18:19.333
THING, AND I DIDN'T WANT THAT ON

18:19.400 --> 18:21.066
MY CONSCIENCE, LET ALONE ANYBODY

18:21.133 --> 18:22.066
TO DIE BECAUSE OF SOMETHING I

18:22.133 --> 18:25.566
SAID WRONG.

18:25.633 --> 18:26.533
WELL, THAT'S BLEAK.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.033
THERE'S BASICALLY NO SCENARIO

18:28.100 --> 18:31.566
WHERE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

18:31.633 --> 18:32.200
SHOULD BE ACTING LIKE FAST-FOOD

18:32.266 --> 18:33.233
RESTAURANTS.

18:33.300 --> 18:34.033
IN FACT, THE ONLY IDEA THEY

18:34.100 --> 18:34.900
SHOULD BE STEALING FROM THEM IS

18:34.966 --> 18:37.133
THE CONCEPT OF GIVING OUT TOYS.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.166
ADMIT IT, THERAPY WOULD FEEL A

18:38.233 --> 18:40.333
LOT BETTER IF YOU LEFT EACH

18:40.400 --> 18:40.966
SESSION WITH A LITTLE MINION IN

18:41.033 --> 18:43.400
A WIG.

18:44.766 --> 18:45.800
NOW, CEREBRAL INSISTS THOSE

18:45.866 --> 18:46.900
"PILL MILL" COMMENTS WERE TAKEN

18:46.966 --> 18:47.800
OUT OF CONTEXT, THAT IT NEVER

18:47.866 --> 18:48.900
PRESSURES CLINICIANS TO WRITE

18:48.966 --> 18:50.066
PRESCRIPTIONS, AND THAT IT HAS

18:50.133 --> 18:51.066
SYSTEMS SET UP TO QUICKLY HELP

18:51.133 --> 18:53.166
SUICIDAL PATIENTS.

18:53.233 --> 18:59.533
BUT EVEN IF ALL OF THAT IS TRUE,

18:59.600 --> 19:01.533
AND, YOU KNOW!

19:01.600 --> 19:04.833
IT'S CLEAR MENTAL HEALTH APPS

19:04.900 --> 19:05.600
ARE NOT GOING TO SAVE US HERE

19:05.666 --> 19:06.433
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DEALING WITH

19:06.500 --> 19:07.566
THE MAIN ISSUE.

19:07.633 --> 19:09.933
THEY CAN'T SUDDENLY HIRE MORE

19:10.000 --> 19:11.366
CLINICIANS IF NOT ENOUGH EXIST.

19:11.433 --> 19:12.866
AND THAT SHORTAGE SPEAKS TO A

19:12.933 --> 19:13.466
MENTAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT'S

19:13.533 --> 19:14.200
SO DYSFUNCTIONAL, IT SEEMS

19:14.266 --> 19:15.900
ALMOST DESIGNED TO PREVENT

19:15.966 --> 19:16.633
PATIENTS FROM ACCESSING IT, OR

19:16.700 --> 19:17.266
PROVIDERS FROM ENTERING THE

19:17.333 --> 19:18.866
FIELD.

19:18.933 --> 19:20.166
AND A LOT OF THAT COMES DOWN TO

19:20.233 --> 19:22.000
HOW WE PAY FOR CARE.

19:22.066 --> 19:23.600
THERAPY ISN'T CHEAP.

19:23.666 --> 19:25.333
THE TYPICAL FEE FOR A SESSION

19:25.400 --> 19:27.033
WITH A CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER IS

19:27.100 --> 19:30.500
BETWEEN $120 AND $180.

19:30.566 --> 19:31.333
AND THE GOING RATE TO SEE A

19:31.400 --> 19:32.466
PSYCHOLOGIST CAN BE AS MUCH AS

19:32.533 --> 19:34.333
$300.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.833
AND THE THING IS, WE CURRENTLY

19:35.900 --> 19:37.033
HAVE LAWS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO

19:37.100 --> 19:38.533
MAKE TREATMENT BOTH AFFORDABLE

19:38.600 --> 19:41.000
AND ACCESSIBLE.

19:41.066 --> 19:42.833
IN 2008, CONGRESS PASSED A LAW

19:44.766 --> 19:46.666
BASICALLY, THAT BIG INSURANCE

19:46.733 --> 19:49.133
PLANS MUST COVER MENTAL HEALTH

19:49.200 --> 19:49.733
CARE AT THE SAME LEVEL AS ALL

19:49.800 --> 19:51.400
OTHER CARE.

19:51.466 --> 19:53.000
AND JUST TWO YEARS LATER, THE

19:53.066 --> 19:54.300
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT EXTENDED

19:54.366 --> 19:58.000
THAT CONCEPT TO INDIVIDUAL AND

19:58.066 --> 20:00.866
SOME SMALL GROUP PLANS, TOO.

20:00.933 --> 20:01.300
WHICH SOUNDS GREAT.

20:01.366 --> 20:02.266
BUT AS MANY HAVE DISCOVERED, THE

20:02.333 --> 20:04.033
REALITY OF THE SYSTEM CAN BE

20:04.100 --> 20:05.433
STARKLY DIFFERENT, STARTING

20:05.500 --> 20:06.466
WITH SIMPLY FINDING A PROVIDER

20:06.533 --> 20:09.833
WHO TAKES YOUR INSURANCE.

20:09.900 --> 20:10.433
>> I KEPT TELLING MY MOTHER I

20:10.500 --> 20:13.733
WANTED TO SEE A THERAPIST.

20:13.800 --> 20:14.900
THEN IT'S FINDING A THERAPIST,

20:14.966 --> 20:15.633
AND IT'S FINDING A THERAPIST

20:15.700 --> 20:17.033
THAT TAKES YOUR INSURANCE.

20:17.100 --> 20:21.733
>> TO FIND A CHILDREN'S

20:21.800 --> 20:23.766
THERAPIST THAT IS COVERED UNDER

20:23.833 --> 20:24.500
YOUR INSURANCE, IT WAS MAYHEM.

20:24.566 --> 20:25.333
>> YOU COULDN'T FIND ANYBODY?

20:25.400 --> 20:26.266
>> I COULDN'T FIND

20:26.333 --> 20:27.666
ANYBODY.

20:27.733 --> 20:28.966
>> BLUE SHIELD SENT ME A LIST,

20:29.033 --> 20:29.733
LIKE, I SHOULD BE FINE, JUST

20:29.800 --> 20:30.666
MAKE A FEW PHONE CALLS, I'LL

20:30.733 --> 20:32.366
FIND SOMEBODY.

20:32.433 --> 20:34.800
I CALLED EVERYBODY ON THIS LIST.

20:34.866 --> 20:40.200
ONLY ONE PLACE CALLED ME BACK.

20:40.266 --> 20:44.033
NOW, THAT'S DISTRESSING

20:44.100 --> 20:44.800
FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, NOT

20:44.866 --> 20:48.200
LEAST OF WHICH, IT FORCES

20:48.266 --> 20:49.100
SOMEONE INTO THE HARROWING

20:49.166 --> 20:52.400
POSITION OF ACTUALLY WANTING TO

20:52.466 --> 20:52.966
BE CALLED BACK, ON THE PHONE.

20:53.033 --> 20:53.800
WHICH IS HORRIFYING.

20:53.866 --> 20:57.100
THE BEST PHONE CALL IS A TEXT,

20:57.166 --> 20:57.733
THE SECOND BEST IS AN EMAIL, AND

20:57.800 --> 20:58.366
THE THIRD BEST PHONE CALL IS TWO

20:58.433 --> 21:00.066
TRADED VOICEMAILS.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.400
EVERYTHING ELSE IS A NIGHTMARE.

21:03.666 --> 21:04.566
SOME SEEKING CARE HAVE EVEN RUN

21:04.633 --> 21:05.733
UP AGAINST WHAT ARE KNOWN AS

21:05.800 --> 21:06.700
"GHOST NETWORKS," LISTS FROM

21:06.766 --> 21:07.933
INSURANCE PROVIDERS THAT ARE

21:08.033 --> 21:09.100
PADDED WITH CLINICIANS WHO

21:09.166 --> 21:10.066
EITHER DON'T TAKE NEW PATIENTS

21:10.133 --> 21:11.933
OR ARE NO LONGER IN-NETWORK.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
IN ONE 2015 STUDY, RESEARCHERS

21:14.066 --> 21:24.300
POSING AS PATIENTS CALLED THREE

21:24.366 --> 21:24.933
360 PSYCHIATRISTS FROM A LIST OF

21:25.000 --> 21:25.466
IN-NETWORK BLUE CROSS BLUE

21:25.533 --> 21:25.933
SHIELD PROVIDERS.

21:26.000 --> 21:26.933
BUT ONLY 40% OF THOSE CALLS WERE

21:27.000 --> 21:28.466
ANSWERED, AND 16% OF THE NUMBERS

21:28.533 --> 21:29.066
WERE WRONG, INCLUDING NUMBERS

21:29.133 --> 21:29.666
FOR A MCDONALD'S, A BOUTIQUE,

21:29.733 --> 21:30.933
AND A JEWELRY STORE.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.100
ALTHOUGH, TO BE FAIR, IF YOU'RE

21:34.166 --> 21:34.866
A WOMAN IN THE 1950s, A BOUTIQUE

21:34.933 --> 21:36.000
AND A JEWELRY STORE IS

21:36.066 --> 21:36.833
APPARENTLY THE ONLY MENTAL

21:36.900 --> 21:39.166
HEALTHCARE YOU NEED.

21:41.066 --> 21:44.600
"BUCK UP, DOLLY!

21:44.666 --> 21:45.766
YOU'LL BE HAPPIER IF YOU'RE

21:45.833 --> 21:47.766
PRETTIER!"

21:47.833 --> 21:48.800
AND THERE ARE TIMES WHERE THE

21:48.866 --> 21:49.433
INADEQUACY OF THESE LISTS FEELS

21:49.500 --> 21:52.966
PRETTY DELIBERATE.

21:53.033 --> 21:53.466
TAKE MELISSA DAVIES, A

21:53.533 --> 21:54.066
PSYCHOLOGIST IN OHIO, WHO WAS

21:54.133 --> 21:57.733
PART OF ANTHEM'S NETWORK FOR

21:57.800 --> 21:58.333
YEARS WHEN SHE WORKED FOR A

21:58.400 --> 21:58.966
LARGE MEDICAL GROUP.

21:59.033 --> 22:00.066
BUT WHEN SHE STARTED A SOLO

22:00.133 --> 22:01.066
PRACTICE, ANTHEM REFUSED TO

22:01.133 --> 22:04.800
CONTRACT WITH HER, SAYING

22:04.866 --> 22:05.433
THE AREA WAS SATURATED, EVEN

22:05.500 --> 22:06.333
THOUGH SHE WAS ONE OF ONLY THREE

22:06.400 --> 22:06.966
PSYCHOLOGISTS IN THE COUNTY, AND

22:07.033 --> 22:08.733
WHEN SHE EXAMINED THEIR

22:08.800 --> 22:09.500
DIRECTORY, SHE FOUND A GREAT

22:09.566 --> 22:10.133
NUMBER OF THEIR PROVIDERS WERE

22:10.200 --> 22:11.866
NO LONGER PRACTICING OR WERE

22:11.933 --> 22:15.833
DEAD.

22:15.900 --> 22:16.800
LOOK, IT'S NOT THAT RETIREES AND

22:16.866 --> 22:17.433
THE DEAD DON'T HAVE THEIR PLACE

22:17.500 --> 22:19.033
IN SOCIETY.

22:19.100 --> 22:21.500
THEY ABSOLUTELY DO, IT'S RIGHT

22:21.566 --> 22:23.800
IN FRONT OF A TV SET BLASTING

22:23.866 --> 22:24.666
FOX NEWS, BUT THEY'RE NOT WHAT

22:24.733 --> 22:25.300
YOU WANT TO FIND WHEN LOOKING

22:25.366 --> 22:26.333
FOR HEALTHCARE.

22:26.400 --> 22:26.966
AND BECAUSE MENTAL HEALTH IS

22:27.033 --> 22:27.833
OFTEN SEEN AS SUBJECTIVE AND

22:27.900 --> 22:29.000
HARD TO MEASURE, EVEN WHEN

22:29.066 --> 22:30.133
PATIENTS DO FIND A PROVIDER,

22:30.200 --> 22:31.133
INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN DENY

22:31.200 --> 22:33.333
APPROPRIATE TREATMENT.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.066
AND EVEN WHEN THEY APPROVE IT,

22:35.133 --> 22:36.166
IN SOME CASES, THEY'VE

22:36.233 --> 22:36.800
INTERVENED TO PUT AN EARLY STOP

22:36.866 --> 22:39.166
TO IT.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.600
TAKE THIS FAMILY, WHOSE SON

22:40.666 --> 22:42.833
DEALT WITH SUICIDAL IDEATION AND

22:42.900 --> 22:43.466
HAD A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH

22:43.533 --> 22:45.200
THEIR INSURANCE.

22:45.266 --> 22:47.533
>> AFTER YEARS OF ISSUES, THIS

22:47.600 --> 22:48.133
TIME HIS DOCTOR PRESCRIBED

22:48.200 --> 22:49.666
RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT.

22:49.733 --> 22:52.000
SUCH FACILITIES ARE NOT CHEAP

22:52.066 --> 22:53.233
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT LEAH'S

22:53.300 --> 22:54.600
INSURANCE, ANTHEM, COVERS

22:54.666 --> 22:56.800
RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT.

22:56.866 --> 22:57.533
>> THEY SENT ME AN EMAIL SAYING

22:57.600 --> 22:59.466
HE'S APPROVED.

22:59.533 --> 23:00.800
>> BUT, AFTER CHECKING HIM IN,

23:00.866 --> 23:04.166
ANTHEM CAME BACK AND DECIDED THE

23:04.233 --> 23:08.466
TREATMENT WAS NOT MEDICALLY

23:08.533 --> 23:11.766
NECESSARY.

23:11.833 --> 23:12.400
WITH INSURANCE REFUSING TO PAY,

23:12.466 --> 23:12.933
LEAH MADE THE FINANCIALLY

23:13.000 --> 23:13.500
CRUSHING DECISION TO

23:13.566 --> 23:14.300
LET HER SON STAY AND FINISH

23:14.366 --> 23:15.033
TREATMENT, 85 DAYS IN ALL AND

23:15.100 --> 23:20.333
$88,000 OF HER OWN MONEY.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.133
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY

23:21.200 --> 23:21.733
INFURIATING.

23:21.800 --> 23:22.733
AND WHILE THE COMPANY DID

23:22.800 --> 23:23.433
EVENTUALLY AGREE TO PAY SOME OF

23:23.500 --> 23:24.600
THAT BILL, JUST IMAGINE AN

23:24.666 --> 23:26.000
INSURANCE COMPANY REVERSING

23:26.066 --> 23:27.033
THEIR DECISION IN THE MIDDLE OF

23:27.100 --> 23:28.666
ANY OTHER SERIOUS TREATMENT.

23:28.733 --> 23:29.733
"HEY, WE LOVE HOW THIS HEART

23:29.800 --> 23:32.300
SURGERY IS GOING, JUST POPPING

23:32.366 --> 23:33.400
IN TO SAY, IT'S DONE.

23:33.466 --> 23:34.400
YEAH, IT'S DONE NOW.

23:34.466 --> 23:35.033
HIT THE SHOWERS, EVERYONE, GREAT

23:35.100 --> 23:35.733
JOB.

23:35.800 --> 23:36.500
DON'T BOTHER CLOSING ANYTHING

23:36.566 --> 23:37.433
UP, THAT'S NOT MEDICALLY

23:37.500 --> 23:39.600
NECESSARY."

23:40.433 --> 23:41.500
AND DEBATES OVER COVERAGE

23:41.566 --> 23:42.233
BETWEEN INSURANCE AND

23:42.300 --> 23:43.100
HEALTH-CARE PROVIDERS CAN GET

23:43.166 --> 23:45.733
INCREDIBLY ADVERSARIAL.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.133
A REVIEWER FOR ANTHEM AT ONE

23:47.200 --> 23:49.466
POINT HAD AN AVERAGE DENIAL RATE

23:49.533 --> 23:50.600
OF 92% WHEN IT CAME TO DOCTORS'

23:50.666 --> 23:52.366
REQUESTS FOR COVERAGE.

23:52.433 --> 23:53.533
AND YET, ACCORDING TO ONE OF

23:53.600 --> 23:54.900
ANTHEM'S MEDICAL DIRECTORS AT

23:55.000 --> 23:55.733
THE TIME, THERE WAS A GOOD

23:55.800 --> 23:56.733
REASON THEIR SYSTEM OPERATED

23:56.800 --> 23:59.566
THAT WAY.

23:59.633 --> 24:01.833
>> DOCTORS WILL SPIN THE

24:01.900 --> 24:04.433
CLINICAL INFORMATION.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.433
THEY WILL MAKE THINGS APPEAR

24:06.500 --> 24:09.433
MORE SERIOUS THAN, PERHAPS, THEY

24:09.500 --> 24:10.200
ARE BECAUSE THEY FEEL STRONGLY

24:10.266 --> 24:11.200
THE PATIENT NEEDS THIS LEVEL OF

24:11.266 --> 24:13.900
CARE FOR A LITTLE LONGER.

24:13.966 --> 24:15.266
SO YOU DO HAVE A SOMEWHAT

24:15.333 --> 24:16.000
ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

24:16.066 --> 24:17.033
THE REVIEWER AND THE ATTENDING

24:17.100 --> 24:20.466
PHYSICIAN.

24:20.533 --> 24:21.166
>> WAS THAT BEST FOR THE

24:21.233 --> 24:22.066
PATIENT?

24:22.133 --> 24:23.033
>> WELL, IT'S LIKE OUR LEGAL

24:23.100 --> 24:24.866
SYSTEM.

24:24.933 --> 24:25.566
IF YOU -- EACH SIDE, DOES A GOOD

24:25.633 --> 24:26.900
JOB IN PRESENTING THEIR CASE AND

24:26.966 --> 24:28.266
ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS, YOU

24:28.333 --> 24:38.833
ULTIMATELY ARRIVE AT THE TRUTH.

24:38.900 --> 24:39.800
OH, YEAH.

24:39.866 --> 24:42.266
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING WE

24:42.333 --> 24:43.400
KNOW ABOUT THE AMERICAN LEGAL

24:43.466 --> 24:45.066
SYSTEM, IT'S THAT IT ALWAYS

24:45.133 --> 24:45.966
ARRIVES AT THE TRUTH.

24:46.033 --> 24:47.000
IT'S WHY THE INNOCENCE PROJECT

24:47.066 --> 24:47.600
IS MOSTLY JUST TWO GUYS IN AN

24:47.666 --> 24:48.233
EMPTY OFFICE GETTING REALLY GOOD

24:48.300 --> 24:48.766
AT PING PONG.

24:48.833 --> 24:49.633
THERE'S SIMPLY NOTHING ELSE FOR

24:49.700 --> 24:50.766
THEM TO DO.

24:50.833 --> 24:52.800
NOW, I KNOW TREATING CRITICAL

24:52.866 --> 24:53.433
HEALTH CARE AS SOMETHING DOCTORS

24:53.500 --> 24:53.900
HAVE TO "WIN" MAY SEEM

24:53.966 --> 24:55.366
DANGEROUS, BUT THAT MAN WILL

24:55.433 --> 24:56.166
IT ISN'T!

24:56.233 --> 24:58.133
>> I CANNOT, OFFHAND, THINK OF A

24:58.200 --> 24:59.233
SITUATION WHERE A DECISION WAS

24:59.300 --> 25:00.400
MADE TO DISCHARGE A PATIENT FROM

25:00.466 --> 25:02.466
A HOSPITAL AND SOME TERRIBLE

25:02.533 --> 25:03.333
CONSEQUENCE OCCURRED SOON

25:03.400 --> 25:06.000
THEREAFTER.

25:06.066 --> 25:06.833
I'M SURE IT HAPPENS, BUT --

25:06.900 --> 25:10.500
>> WE FOUND QUITE A FEW.

25:11.633 --> 25:12.366
>> I'D HAVE TO LOOK AT THEM TO

25:12.433 --> 25:13.500
SEE.

25:13.566 --> 25:15.600
THERE'S ONE THAT OCCURS TO ME

25:15.666 --> 25:17.966
THAT I WAS INVOLVED WITH WHERE

25:18.033 --> 25:22.033
THE CHILD LEFT THE HOSPITAL WITH

25:22.100 --> 25:23.966
HIS PARENTS, ESCAPED FROM HIS

25:24.033 --> 25:25.200
PARENTS, DROVE CROSS COUNTRY TO

25:25.266 --> 25:26.466
ANOTHER STATE, AND DAYS LATER,

25:26.533 --> 25:30.200
COMMITTED SUICIDE.

25:30.266 --> 25:32.266
KEEPING THAT INDIVIDUAL IN THE

25:32.333 --> 25:33.600
HOSPITAL LONGER IS NOT LIKELY TO

25:33.666 --> 25:36.366
HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE.

25:36.433 --> 25:38.533
>> I WOULD HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT

25:38.600 --> 25:40.400
THE PARENTS WOULD SAY, IF YOU'D

25:40.466 --> 25:42.733
KEPT HIM IN THE HOSPITAL, HE

25:42.800 --> 25:45.300
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN ANOTHER

25:45.366 --> 25:50.533
STATE KILLING HIMSELF.

25:50.600 --> 25:51.433
HOLY SHIT.

25:51.500 --> 25:52.300
DO YOU THINK THAT GUY WENT INTO

25:52.366 --> 25:53.000
THAT INTERVIEW KNOWING HE WAS

25:53.066 --> 25:53.833
ABOUT TO BE ABSOLUTELY MURDERED

25:53.900 --> 25:54.766
BY SCOTT PELLEY ON NETWORK TV?

25:54.833 --> 25:55.466
DO YOU THINK HE WAS GETTING

25:55.533 --> 25:56.333
READY IN THE MORNING, AND

25:56.400 --> 25:57.233
THOUGHT "I'VE GOT THAT INTERVIEW

25:57.300 --> 25:58.200
WITH CBS NEWS'S SCOTT PELLEY

25:58.266 --> 25:58.833
TONIGHT, I WONDER IF HE'S GOING

25:58.900 --> 25:59.666
TO TAKE MY STUPIDEST SOUNDBITE

25:59.733 --> 26:00.700
AND FEED IT BACK TO ME RIGHT

26:00.766 --> 26:02.633
THROUGH MY FUCKING TEETH?"

26:03.733 --> 26:04.533
WAS HE DRIVING TO THE INTERVIEW

26:04.600 --> 26:05.500
THINKING "I WONDER IF ANY OF THE

26:05.566 --> 26:06.533
CAMERA CREW WILL STEP IN AS

26:06.600 --> 26:07.433
BELOVED, PEABODY-AWARD-WINNING

26:07.500 --> 26:09.300
NEWSMAN SCOTT PELLEY RUNS ME

26:09.366 --> 26:10.166
ACROSS THE FLOOR LIKE A SWIFFER

26:10.233 --> 26:11.100
MOP, OR WILL THEY JUST STAND BY

26:11.166 --> 26:12.366
AS MY LIFELESS BODY IS

26:12.433 --> 26:12.933
DESERVEDLY WHIPPED BACK AND

26:13.000 --> 26:15.033
FORTH?"

26:16.333 --> 26:17.266
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW

26:17.333 --> 26:18.666
INSURERS CAN GET AWAY WITH THAT

26:18.733 --> 26:19.700
SORT OF THINKING, IT'S PARTLY

26:19.766 --> 26:20.900
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS, TO

26:20.966 --> 26:22.433
THIS POINT, DONE SHOCKINGLY

26:22.500 --> 26:23.166
LITTLE WHEN IT COMES TO

26:23.233 --> 26:25.900
ENFORCING PARITY LAWS.

26:25.966 --> 26:27.766
MULTIPLE FEDERAL AND STATE

26:27.833 --> 26:29.100
AGENCIES HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

26:29.166 --> 26:30.066
THIS, BUT THE TRUTH IS, THEY

26:30.133 --> 26:31.500
RARELY PENALIZE PLANS.

26:31.566 --> 26:32.933
THE LABOR DEPARTMENT, WHICH

26:33.000 --> 26:38.033
OVERSEES MOST WORKPLACE PLANS,

26:38.100 --> 26:45.500
CLOSED JUST 74 INVESTIGATIONS

26:45.566 --> 26:46.133
LAST YEAR, FINDING VIOLATIONS IN

26:46.200 --> 26:47.066
ONLY 12.

26:47.133 --> 26:48.233
AS FOR STATE-LEVEL ENFORCEMENT,

26:48.300 --> 26:48.800
A STUDY FOUND THEY'VE LEVIED

26:48.866 --> 26:53.000
FINES JUST 13 TIMES SINCE 2017,

26:53.066 --> 26:54.433
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC.

26:54.500 --> 26:55.466
AND IT'S NOT JUST PRIVATE

26:55.533 --> 26:56.133
INSURERS THAT ARE A NIGHTMARE.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.000
COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH CLINICS,

26:57.066 --> 26:58.966
WHICH OFTEN SERVE LOW-INCOME

26:59.033 --> 26:59.933
PATIENTS, ARE SUFFERING AS WELL,

27:00.000 --> 27:00.766
BECAUSE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES

27:00.833 --> 27:02.166
FOR PUBLIC INSURANCE, LIKE

27:02.233 --> 27:03.133
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, ARE ALSO

27:03.200 --> 27:04.966
WOEFULLY INSUFFICIENT.

27:05.033 --> 27:06.966
BASICALLY, FROM TOP TO BOTTOM,

27:07.033 --> 27:08.900
WE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERPAY MENTAL

27:08.966 --> 27:10.766
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, MANY OF

27:10.833 --> 27:11.400
WHOM DO DIFFICULT, HIGH-BURNOUT

27:11.466 --> 27:14.066
WORK.

27:14.133 --> 27:14.766
IT'S NO WONDER SO MANY OPT OUT

27:14.833 --> 27:16.333
OF THE SYSTEM.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.866
ONE STUDY FOUND PATIENTS ARE

27:17.933 --> 27:19.633
MORE THAN FIVE TIMES AS LIKELY

27:19.700 --> 27:21.600
TO HAVE TO USE OUT OF NETWORK

27:21.666 --> 27:23.000
PROVIDERS FOR BEHAVIORAL CARE,

27:23.066 --> 27:25.000
THAN FOR OTHER MEDICAL SERVICES.

27:25.066 --> 27:26.166
JUST LISTEN TO THESE TWO

27:26.233 --> 27:27.600
COUNSELORS WHO SPOKE ANONYMOUSLY

27:27.666 --> 27:28.500
TO LOCAL NEWS ABOUT THEIR

27:28.566 --> 27:29.633
CONCERNS OVER WHAT ALL THIS

27:29.700 --> 27:32.133
MIGHT MEAN.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.466
>> THE COUNSELORS SAY INSURERS

27:34.533 --> 27:37.500
TAKE 90 DAYS TO PAY THEM AND THE

27:37.566 --> 27:40.800
PAYMENTS ARE SO LOW, FEWER

27:40.866 --> 27:41.400
MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS ARE

27:41.466 --> 27:43.000
TAKING INSURANCE.

27:43.066 --> 27:44.433
>> WE WILL FACE A CRISIS WHERE

27:44.500 --> 27:45.433
PEOPLE ARE ONLY ABLE TO GET

27:45.500 --> 27:46.433
SERVICES IF THEY CAN PAY OUT OF

27:46.500 --> 27:48.100
POCKET.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.600
>> BOTH THERAPISTS WANTED US TO

27:49.666 --> 27:51.100
CONCEAL THEIR IDENTITIES OUT OF

27:51.166 --> 27:53.133
CONCERN FOR PATIENT PRIVACY AND

27:53.200 --> 27:54.166
BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVE TO WORK

27:54.233 --> 27:59.933
WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.666
>> SO AS PROVIDERS WHEN PEOPLE

28:01.733 --> 28:03.233
THINK, OH, YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST

28:03.300 --> 28:03.866
FOR THE MONEY, OR WE DON'T CARE.

28:03.933 --> 28:04.833
OH, NO, WE CARE.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.233
WE CARE A LOT.

28:06.300 --> 28:07.100
BUT THESE COMPANIES ARE ALSO

28:07.166 --> 28:07.866
DRIVING US INTO THE GROUND AND

28:07.933 --> 28:08.766
WE CAN'T -- THIS IS NOT

28:08.833 --> 28:09.333
SUSTAINABLE.

28:09.400 --> 28:10.900
YEAH, OF COURSE IT

28:10.966 --> 28:11.766
ISN'T.

28:11.833 --> 28:12.633
THERAPISTS ARE IN A NO-WIN

28:12.700 --> 28:13.833
SITUATION HERE.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.333
AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, IT'S

28:15.400 --> 28:16.466
NOT A GREAT SIGN THAT INSURANCE

28:16.533 --> 28:17.966
COMPANIES ARE NOW SO POWERFUL

28:18.033 --> 28:19.233
THAT MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS

28:19.300 --> 28:20.066
FEEL THEY HAVE TO GO ON THE NEWS

28:20.133 --> 28:21.300
LIKE THEY'RE IN WITNESS

28:21.366 --> 28:22.100
PROTECTION AFTER SEEING SOMEONE

28:22.166 --> 28:24.400
GET WHACKED.

28:25.700 --> 28:26.900
AND THE THING IS, SOME

28:26.966 --> 28:28.200
OUT-OF-NETWORK THERAPISTS CAN

28:28.266 --> 28:29.866
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY, IF THEY

28:29.933 --> 28:32.533
LIVE IN AN AREA WITH PATIENTS

28:32.600 --> 28:33.133
THAT CAN AFFORD TO PAY OUT OF

28:33.200 --> 28:34.566
POCKET.

28:34.633 --> 28:35.733
BUT FOR THE MANY WHO DON'T,

28:35.800 --> 28:36.600
THEY'RE STUCK TAKING WHATEVER

28:36.666 --> 28:39.900
INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE WILLING

28:39.966 --> 28:40.766
TO PAY, WHICH EXPLAINS WHY

28:40.833 --> 28:42.266
PSYCHIATRY WAS RANKED ONE OF THE

28:42.333 --> 28:43.300
LOWEST IN COMPENSATION AMONG

28:43.366 --> 28:45.333
29 MEDICAL SPECIALTIES.

28:45.400 --> 28:46.800
AND IT'S NOT JUST DOCTORS.

28:46.866 --> 28:49.933
COUNSELORS AND SOCIAL WORKERS

28:50.000 --> 28:51.800
WITH MASTERS DEGREES EARN 33% TO

28:51.866 --> 28:53.333
45% LESS THAN OTHER HEALTH

28:53.400 --> 28:54.966
PROFESSIONALS WITH A COMPARABLE

28:55.033 --> 28:56.400
EDUCATION.

28:56.466 --> 28:58.066
AND AS BAD AS OUR SITUATION IS

28:58.133 --> 29:00.366
RIGHT NOW, IT'S GETTING WORSE.

29:00.433 --> 29:02.300
ONE SURVEY IN MASSACHUSETTS SAID

29:02.366 --> 29:04.200
THAT FOR EVERY TEN CLINICIANS

29:04.266 --> 29:05.466
ENTERING WORK IN MENTAL HEALTH

29:05.533 --> 29:08.066
CLINICS THERE, 13 LEAVE.

29:08.133 --> 29:10.433
AND IF WE CONTINUE AT THAT RATE,

29:10.500 --> 29:12.600
ONE DAY, WE'RE GOING TO WIND UP

29:12.666 --> 29:13.800
WITH NEGATIVE THERAPISTS, WHICH

29:13.866 --> 29:14.900
I'M PRETTY SURE IS WHAT YOU CALL

29:14.966 --> 29:15.766
ANYONE WHO RESPONDS TO YOUR

29:15.833 --> 29:17.233
SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

29:17.300 --> 29:18.633
WITH "INTERESTING, I CAN'T WAIT

29:18.700 --> 29:21.300
TO GET INTO MY JAMMIES LATER."

29:23.166 --> 29:24.666
AND THE COSTS OF LEAVING MENTAL

29:24.733 --> 29:25.766
HEALTH UNTREATED CAN BE MASSIVE,

29:25.833 --> 29:26.800
NOT JUST FOR THOSE NEEDING

29:26.866 --> 29:29.433
IT, BUT FOR ALL OF US.

29:29.500 --> 29:30.733
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE A BIG

29:30.800 --> 29:32.366
DRIVER OF HOMELESSNESS, AND ALSO

29:32.433 --> 29:33.000
FORCE PEOPLE INTO CONTACT WITH

29:33.066 --> 29:34.366
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

29:34.433 --> 29:35.800
IN FACT, IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT

29:35.866 --> 29:38.066
CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES HAVE

29:38.133 --> 29:39.566
BECOME THE LARGEST PROVIDERS OF

29:39.633 --> 29:40.200
MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN

29:40.266 --> 29:41.866
OUR COUNTRY.

29:41.933 --> 29:43.166
BASICALLY, WE'VE GONE FROM

29:43.233 --> 29:44.666
WAREHOUSING PEOPLE WITH MENTAL

29:44.733 --> 29:46.000
ILLNESS IN BUILDINGS THAT FELT

29:46.066 --> 29:47.733
LIKE PRISONS, TO WAREHOUSING

29:47.800 --> 29:49.600
THEM IN ACTUAL PRISONS INSTEAD.

29:49.666 --> 29:51.600
IT'S VERY MUCH THE "NEW LOOK,

29:51.666 --> 29:52.233
SAME GREAT TASTE" OF AMERICA'S

29:52.300 --> 29:55.166
FAILURES.

29:56.433 --> 29:57.866
SO HOW DO WE FIX ALL THIS?

29:57.933 --> 29:59.066
WELL, FIRST, THIS IS CLEARLY AN

29:59.133 --> 30:00.100
ABSURD WAY TO OPERATE A HEALTH

30:00.166 --> 30:02.800
CARE SYSTEM.

30:02.866 --> 30:04.133
AND FOR THE UMPTEENTH TIME, I'D

30:04.200 --> 30:05.233
ARGUE SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH CARE

30:05.300 --> 30:08.300
IS THE WAY TO GO.

30:09.400 --> 30:10.966
UNFORTUNATELY, WE CAN'T GET

30:11.033 --> 30:12.033
THAT, BECAUSE IT'S VERY HIGH UP

30:12.100 --> 30:14.200
ON A SHELF.

30:15.466 --> 30:16.666
I DON'T KNOW WHO LEFT IT THERE,

30:16.733 --> 30:17.233
BUT THEY MUST'VE BEEN TALL

30:17.300 --> 30:17.933
BECAUSE IT IS WAY TOO HIGH TO

30:18.000 --> 30:20.433
REACH.

30:20.500 --> 30:21.066
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, WHY NOT

30:21.133 --> 30:22.166
USE A LADDER?

30:22.233 --> 30:24.600
THE LADDER'S ALSO ON THE SHELF.

30:25.466 --> 30:26.266
IT'S A REALLY FRUSTRATING

30:26.333 --> 30:27.266
SITUATION.

30:27.333 --> 30:28.300
BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT, WE

30:28.366 --> 30:29.300
NEED TO BOTH RECRUIT MORE MENTAL

30:29.366 --> 30:30.100
HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, AND

30:30.166 --> 30:30.966
MAKE SURE THAT INSURERS COVER

30:31.033 --> 30:34.333
THEM PROPERLY.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.166
NOW, ON THE FIRST POINT, THE

30:35.233 --> 30:36.133
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, TO ITS

30:36.200 --> 30:37.200
CREDIT, ANNOUNCED A PLAN BACK IN

30:37.266 --> 30:38.133
MARCH THAT'D PROVIDE $100

30:38.200 --> 30:39.966
BILLION IN MANDATORY FUNDING

30:40.033 --> 30:41.233
OVER TEN YEARS TO TRANSFORM OUR

30:41.300 --> 30:43.200
CURRENT SYSTEM, WHICH INCLUDES

30:43.266 --> 30:44.433
INVESTING $700 MILLION IN

30:44.500 --> 30:45.600
PROGRAMS TO COVER EVERYTHING

30:45.666 --> 30:47.233
FROM TRAINING TO SCHOLARSHIPS

30:47.300 --> 30:48.766
AND LOAN REPAYMENTS FOR THOSE

30:48.833 --> 30:49.333
COMMITTED TO WORKING IN

30:49.400 --> 30:51.200
UNDERSERVED AREAS.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.033
BUT OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S ONLY HALF

30:52.100 --> 30:54.333
THE BATTLE.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.133
ON THE INSURANCE COMPANY SIDE,

30:56.200 --> 30:57.566
WE BADLY NEED TO BE

30:57.633 --> 30:58.700
STRENGTHENING AND ENFORCING

30:58.766 --> 31:00.500
THOSE MENTAL-HEALTH PARITY LAWS,

31:00.566 --> 31:01.533
AT BOTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL

31:01.600 --> 31:03.400
LEVEL.

31:03.466 --> 31:04.466
CALIFORNIA HAS ACTUALLY PUT IN

31:04.533 --> 31:05.600
ONE OF THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE

31:05.666 --> 31:07.766
PARITY LAWS IN THE COUNTRY.

31:07.833 --> 31:10.533
AMONG MANY, MANY OTHER THINGS,

31:10.600 --> 31:13.000
IT REQUIRES THAT INSURERS MUST

31:13.066 --> 31:14.066
BASE MEDICAL NECESSITY

31:14.133 --> 31:16.900
DETERMINATIONS ON

31:16.966 --> 31:19.133
CURRENT, GENERALLY ACCEPTED

31:19.200 --> 31:23.533
STANDARDS OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE,

31:23.600 --> 31:25.433
INSTEAD OF JUST MAKING UP THE

31:25.500 --> 31:30.200
CRITERIA FOR THEMSELVES.

31:30.266 --> 31:31.300
THAT IS A VERY BIG DEAL, AND

31:31.366 --> 31:31.833
MORE STATES SHOULD FOLLOW

31:31.900 --> 31:33.300
CALIFORNIA'S LEAD.

31:33.366 --> 31:34.400
IN THE PAST, SO MUCH OF THE

31:34.466 --> 31:35.033
PROBLEM WAS THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T

31:35.100 --> 31:35.766
ASK FOR HELP, AND THANKFULLY

31:35.833 --> 31:36.900
THAT'S NOW LESS OF AN ISSUE NOW,

31:36.966 --> 31:37.800
THANKS TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

31:37.866 --> 31:40.133
THE TIRELESS GLAND SHAMING OF

31:40.200 --> 31:42.400
MR. HARRISON FORD.

31:43.866 --> 31:44.800
BUT NOW, WHEN PEOPLE DO REACH

31:44.866 --> 31:45.533
OUT FOR HELP, WE'RE JUST NOT IN

31:45.600 --> 31:46.766
A POSITION TO GIVE IT TO THEM.

31:46.833 --> 31:47.533
IF WE WANT TO BE A SOCIETY THAT

31:47.600 --> 31:48.766
TRULY RESPECTS AND VALUES MENTAL

31:48.833 --> 31:49.900
HEALTH, WE HAVE TO RESPECT AND

31:49.966 --> 31:51.900
VALUE MENTAL HEALTH CARE.

31:51.966 --> 31:52.766
AND THAT MEANS SUPPORTING THE

31:52.833 --> 31:57.133
PEOPLE WHO DELIVER IT.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.700
LOOK, IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT

31:59.766 --> 32:03.200
OF INVESTMENT AND CONTINUED

32:03.266 --> 32:04.400
RESOLVE TO FIX THINGS, BUT IT'S

32:04.466 --> 32:05.066
ALSO WORTH IT.

32:05.133 --> 32:05.700
BECAUSE IT CAN'T BE THE CASE

32:05.766 --> 32:06.700
THAT, WHEN PEOPLE ASK FOR HELP,

32:06.766 --> 32:10.366
OUR ONLY OPTION IS TO TELL THEM

32:10.433 --> 32:11.033
TO "SUCK IT UP, BUTTERCUP."

32:11.100 --> 32:13.433
AND NOW, THIS.

32:13.500 --> 32:16.400
AND NOW,

32:16.466 --> 32:23.500
THE WORLD'S HORNIEST

32:23.566 --> 32:23.833
TELEVANGELIST.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.466
SPEAKER EVERYWHERE I GO I TELL

32:25.533 --> 32:27.800
PEOPLE TO STROKE THEIR BIBLE,

32:27.866 --> 32:32.266
RUB IT OVER YOUR FACE.

32:32.333 --> 32:34.733
>> I REALLY LIKE THAT.

32:34.800 --> 32:37.933
I LOOK AT A WOMAN'S ANKLES, HER

32:38.000 --> 32:39.533
TOENAILS, HER FINGERNAILS.

32:39.600 --> 32:42.300
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY CUTOFFS ARE

32:42.366 --> 32:43.500
SEXY, BUT THEY ARE.

32:43.566 --> 32:44.766
I DON'T LIKE LONG SHORTS COME I

32:44.833 --> 32:47.500
WANT TO SEE EVERYTHING I CAN, I

32:47.566 --> 32:48.900
AM A MAN.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.166
>> YOU THINK WHEN I THINK OF

32:51.233 --> 32:51.700
MARRIAGE I AM THINKING OF

32:51.766 --> 32:55.266
BLACK-EYED PEAS, CORN, GLASS OF

32:55.333 --> 32:57.266
ICED TEA?

32:57.333 --> 33:00.833
THAT IS MARRIED?

33:00.900 --> 33:02.766
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

33:02.833 --> 33:04.300
I WANT A SEX POT STRIPPING ON

33:04.366 --> 33:05.500
STAGE IN FRONT OF ME IN THE

33:05.566 --> 33:07.566
BEDROOM.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.766
>> COVER THOSE UP, BUT SHE WANTS

33:12.833 --> 33:18.066
YOU TO SEE THE MOUNTAINS BECAUSE

33:18.133 --> 33:19.933
MEN SEE MOUNTAINS AND THEY

33:20.000 --> 33:20.433
START THINKING.

33:20.500 --> 33:23.000
>> 31 SECRETS OF AN

33:23.066 --> 33:23.700
UNFORGETTABLE WOMAN.

33:23.766 --> 33:24.633
UNBELIEVABLE BOOK, I STARTED

33:24.700 --> 33:26.800
CRYING WHEN I STARTED READING

33:26.866 --> 33:28.300
THIS BOOK THAT I WAS WRITING.

33:32.433 --> 33:33.900
THAT'S OUR SHOW,

33:33.966 --> 33:35.766
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

33:35.833 --> 33:36.333
TO SEE YOU NEXT WEEK, GOOD

33:36.400 --> 33:38.333
NIGHT.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.133
>> IN DECEMBER, I'LL BE IN

33:39.200 --> 33:40.166
BEIJING, OPENING UP NEW PORK
