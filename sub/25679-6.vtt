{\an8}(Lyrica)
Previously on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

00:05.438 --> 00:08.408
{\an8}(Paris)
I digged up some stuff
on Mr. Akbar.

00:08.475 --> 00:10.477
{\an7}On the blogs, they were saying
that he might be married.

00:10.543 --> 00:12.145
{\an7}I'ma get to the bottom
of this.

00:12.212 --> 00:14.848
{\an7}People are really believing
that this is your wife,

00:14.914 --> 00:15.982
{\an8}and I'm looking crazy.

00:16.049 --> 00:17.817
{\an8}That's in my past.

00:17.884 --> 00:20.820
{\an8}That's in the past?

00:17.884 --> 00:20.820
{\an9}Yes.

00:20.887 --> 00:22.522
{\an8}(Nikki)
I don't know how nobody knew
about each other.

00:22.589 --> 00:24.624
{\an8}Obviously they have
some type of arrangement.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.760
{\an8}He's a womanizer.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.760
{\an8}You don't know what
she got going on!

00:26.826 --> 00:28.862
{\an8}Maybe she don't
wanna tell you!

00:28.928 --> 00:31.798
{\an8}How would you feel
if I was pregnant?

00:33.900 --> 00:35.969
{\an7}(Brooke)
This is a fun girl.
You a little horny.

00:36.035 --> 00:37.837
{\an7}Cool!
Are we done?

00:37.904 --> 00:40.407
{\an8}If you don't prove that this is
something that's solid for me,

00:40.473 --> 00:41.841
{\an8}I don't want it.

00:41.908 --> 00:43.977
{\an7}You could use
a few of those.

00:44.043 --> 00:46.079
{\an7}Break up with him
before he break up with you.

00:46.146 --> 00:48.648
{\an8}You and her,
y'all go.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.283
{\an7}I have something special
planned for us.

00:50.350 --> 00:51.284
{\an8}How special?

00:54.354 --> 00:56.389
{\an8}Bro, you done changed.
You don't think
y'all need a divorce?

00:56.456 --> 00:58.825
{\an7}When are you gonna
wake the (bleep) up?

00:58.892 --> 01:00.560
{\an8}(Lyrica)
I was there for you when you
was on food stamps.

01:00.627 --> 01:03.163
{\an8}I was there for you when (bleep)
didn't even wanna work with you.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.799
{\an8}I'm done with you, bruh.

01:05.865 --> 01:07.634
{\an8}(Lyrica)
It might be time to work
with a new producer.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.169
{\an8}(Roccstar)
Did you break up with A1?

01:09.235 --> 01:11.805
{\an8}That's a wrap.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.805
{\an8}Shut the hell up!

01:11.871 --> 01:14.441
{\an7}What are we even into it for
in the first place?

01:11.871 --> 01:14.441
{\an4}Yo--

01:14.507 --> 01:16.943
{\an7}What are you looking at, bro?
Like, what you takin'
your jacket off for?

01:17.010 --> 01:19.012
{\an8}I gotta take it off
in case you get stupid!

01:19.078 --> 01:21.514
{\an8}I am stupid.

01:19.078 --> 01:21.514
{\an8}What you tryin' to do?

01:21.581 --> 01:25.518

{\an8}♪♪

01:53.379 --> 01:57.083
{\an8}I enjoyed my fake ass
for a long time,

01:57.150 --> 01:59.919
{\an8}and one day,
I got up out of bed,

01:59.986 --> 02:01.187
{\an8}and I could not walk.

02:01.254 --> 02:05.058
It gradually got worse,
so I decided to meet

02:05.124 --> 02:07.560
with one of the best doctors
in Beverly Hills

02:07.627 --> 02:10.430
about removing the silicone
from my body

02:10.497 --> 02:12.765
so that I can really get back
to being healthy again.

02:12.832 --> 02:15.668
{\an1}Oh, my God.
Today is the big day.

02:15.735 --> 02:17.604
{\an5}Thank you for coming.

02:15.735 --> 02:17.604
{\an1}Of course.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.873
{\an7}It's the least I could do
after acting all donkey

02:19.939 --> 02:21.474
{\an7}at your--
backstage at your show.

02:21.541 --> 02:23.176
Just like Lyrica G.

02:23.243 --> 02:25.778
Which I'm not gonna fight
with nobody mama.

02:25.845 --> 02:29.148
{\an1}And speaking of Lyrica, girl,
I saw her at this showcase.

02:29.215 --> 02:32.118
{\an1}Some girl named La'Britney
was performing.

02:32.185 --> 02:34.554
{\an1}She couldn't sing on key
to save her life.

02:34.621 --> 02:37.190
{\an1}Lyrica, well,
she confronts La'Britney

02:37.257 --> 02:38.758
for being at her man's show.

02:38.825 --> 02:43.196
{\an1}Roccstar is across the way,
insulting him.

02:43.263 --> 02:44.564
Like, goin' in.

02:44.631 --> 02:45.965
Does she know this man?

02:46.032 --> 02:48.434
{\an1}They said they're
best friends.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.770
{\an5}Girl, doesn't sound right.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.770
That don't even
sound right.

02:50.837 --> 02:54.040
One thing about the truth,
it always reveals itself.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.508
{\an5}Hi, Doctor.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.508
Hi, Kimberly.

02:55.575 --> 02:56.743
{\an5}Lovely meeting you.

02:55.575 --> 02:56.743
How are you?

02:56.809 --> 02:58.144
{\an1}Dr. David Sayah.
Welcome.

02:58.211 --> 02:59.612
{\an5}Good to see you.
Good to see you.

02:58.211 --> 02:59.612
Moniece.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.613
{\an5}Nice meeting you.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.613
Hi, Moniece.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.915
{\an7}David Sayah.
Welcome.

03:01.981 --> 03:04.417
{\an8}So, how are you ladies
doing today?

03:04.484 --> 03:05.952
Um, I'm having
some issues

03:06.019 --> 03:08.888
with those injections
that I got.

03:08.955 --> 03:12.125
Can you tell me exactly what
you had injected and where?

03:12.191 --> 03:13.726
Like, five years ago,

03:13.793 --> 03:16.029
everybody was getting
these butt shots.

03:16.095 --> 03:19.399
So, I got these injections
and then it started

03:19.465 --> 03:22.402
to catch up with me
about a year and half ago,

03:22.468 --> 03:24.737
and I just kept on
being fatigued.

03:24.804 --> 03:27.006
I just can't make it through
a whole hour and 30 minutes

03:27.073 --> 03:29.576
when it used to be
easy-breezy for me.

03:29.642 --> 03:31.444
I just want people to--
to look at me.

03:31.511 --> 03:34.380
Like, I've been
telling people that.

03:34.447 --> 03:37.116
Aww, Bookie.

03:37.183 --> 03:39.819
(sobbing)
It's just not worth it.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.822
These butt injections
are something that I regret

03:42.889 --> 03:45.291
every single day of my life.

03:45.358 --> 03:47.860
If people could learn
anything from me,

03:47.927 --> 03:51.764
it would be that sometimes
imperfect is what's perfect.

03:51.831 --> 03:54.767
{\an4}The silicone
that you had injected
is like motor oil,

03:54.834 --> 03:57.303
{\an1}and it tends to kind of go
through the tissues,

03:57.370 --> 03:58.571
{\an1}and it doesn't stay
in one place,

03:58.638 --> 04:01.574
{\an1}and so it becomes tiny,
tiny, little droplets

04:01.641 --> 04:04.744
{\an1}and your body forms scar tissue
around each droplet.

04:04.811 --> 04:07.013
Hearing Kimberly's story
about how she did this

04:07.080 --> 04:10.550
when she was a lot younger,
and now some of the damage

04:10.617 --> 04:14.020
may be irreversible,
is wild.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.955
{\an1}Won't be able to take
all of it out.

04:16.022 --> 04:19.091
{\an1}That is impossible 'cause it
really invades everything.

04:19.158 --> 04:21.961
{\an1}But I'm gonna really try to
remove as much as we can safely

04:22.028 --> 04:24.130
{\an1}without causing
too much deformity.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.599
I just want
my health back.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.604
{\an8}(Apple)
It's called the booty walk.

04:31.671 --> 04:32.805
{\an8}(Lyrica)
What? The booty walk?

04:32.872 --> 04:34.140
{\an8}It's what you do.
It's like scoot--

04:34.207 --> 04:35.808
{\an8}It's like you scooting,
one, two,

04:35.875 --> 04:38.611
{\an8}three, four,
five, six.

04:38.678 --> 04:40.647
(both shouting)

04:40.713 --> 04:42.515
{\an5}(Lyrica)
I still cannot get over
all the stuff

04:42.582 --> 04:45.151
that went down
at Donatella's showcase.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.153
{\an8}I decided to hit
my girl Apple up

04:47.220 --> 04:49.689
because I need to get my mind
off of A1 right now,

04:49.756 --> 04:52.525
so I thought an intense workout
would help.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.560
{\an1}Whew!
First of all, girl,

04:54.627 --> 04:55.928
{\an1}that was a workout
that I wasn't ready for.

04:55.995 --> 04:57.964
Okay, I really wanna
ask you this.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.432
What the hell happened
at that party?

04:59.499 --> 05:02.335
{\an5}You and La'Britney
was goin' at it.

04:59.499 --> 05:02.335
{\an1}Oh, gosh.

05:02.402 --> 05:05.405
'Cause I saw her on the Gram
doin' the most at his show.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.340
{\an6}So she--

05:05.471 --> 05:07.340
{\an1}And we have
each other's Instagram,

05:07.407 --> 05:08.908
{\an1}and I saw her
in his DMs.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.010
But that (bleep) happened
so out the blue,

05:11.077 --> 05:12.378
I'm thinkin'
y'all 'bout to squab.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.213
(Lyrica)
You know, I get it.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.016
La'Britney and Apple are both
trying to work with A1.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.618
He's one of the hottest
producers in the game.

05:18.685 --> 05:21.154
But the difference between
La'Britney and Apple is,

05:21.220 --> 05:23.623
Apple came at me correctly
and apologized.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.892
This other girl is actin' like
she runs the town.

05:25.958 --> 05:29.028
Roccstar's so messy, but,
like, I really wanna know,

05:29.095 --> 05:30.697
what the hell is the tea
between them two?

05:30.763 --> 05:31.964
Like, they was squabbin'.

05:32.031 --> 05:35.635
{\an1}When I got with A1,
I cut a lot of people off.

05:35.702 --> 05:37.704
{\an1}So, Roccstar, I feel like,
is still holding

05:37.770 --> 05:39.739
{\an4}some sort of resentment
towards A1.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.739
{\an3}Yeah.

05:39.806 --> 05:42.008
{\an1}I think he feels like A1
took me away

05:42.075 --> 05:44.043
{\an1}from our working
relationship.

05:44.110 --> 05:45.645
So Roccstar
on that slick (bleep).

05:45.712 --> 05:48.581
He was never trying to get me
in the studio to help me.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.083
He was just trying
to get back at A1.

05:50.149 --> 05:53.086
And I sure for damn sure
don't want no parts of that.

05:53.152 --> 05:55.088
You and A1, what y'all
gonna do about y'all?

05:55.154 --> 05:57.190
We're separated right now.

05:57.256 --> 06:00.727
{\an1}But one thing I know is,
I love him and he loves me.

06:00.793 --> 06:01.994
And at the end of the day,

06:02.061 --> 06:03.262
{\an4}nobody's relationship
is perfect.

06:02.061 --> 06:03.262
{\an3}Right.

06:03.329 --> 06:05.798
{\an1}I hope, you know,
we can somehow work it out.

06:05.865 --> 06:08.367
{\an1}I mean, we'll see what happens.
I ain't talked to him yet.

06:08.434 --> 06:09.502
{\an3}Yeah.

06:09.569 --> 06:12.271
(phone ringing)

06:12.338 --> 06:14.373
Well, that's probably Roccstar
calling you right now, bitch.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.676
{\an3}Oh, girl.

06:16.743 --> 06:18.845
{\an5}(phone continues ringing)

06:16.743 --> 06:18.845
No, it's my dad.

06:18.911 --> 06:21.481
Like, I just, um--

06:18.911 --> 06:21.481
{\an1}Ohh.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.249
Like, I just met my dad,
like, a few years ago.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.717
{\an4}Really?

06:23.316 --> 06:24.717
You know what I'm sayin'?

06:24.784 --> 06:26.385
But, you know,
I was in foster care

06:26.452 --> 06:27.754
for so long,
my whole life.

06:27.820 --> 06:31.257
{\an1}So, one time, I just decided
just to look him up.

06:31.324 --> 06:33.893
My dad left my mom
when I was a baby

06:33.960 --> 06:35.628
and he never came back
for me, period.

06:35.695 --> 06:37.463
But when my mom got caught up,

06:37.530 --> 06:39.499
the foster care system
took me away from her.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.701
So, as my dad tried
to reenter my life,

06:41.768 --> 06:44.103
I'm just more hesitant
to open a door for my dad

06:44.170 --> 06:45.505
because of my past.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.840
{\an1}I don't know my dad.
I've never met my dad before.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.942
{\an1}And I always was like,
"What does that feel like?"

06:50.009 --> 06:51.444
{\an5}You know what I'm saying?

06:50.009 --> 06:51.444
See, and that's what--

06:51.511 --> 06:52.979
Now that I got it--
the feeling--

06:53.045 --> 06:54.614
I don't know
if I like the feeling.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.282
{\an1}Really?

06:54.680 --> 06:56.282
{\an3}You know?

06:56.349 --> 06:58.050
Boy, you been gone all my life.
Your daughter's on the streets.

06:58.117 --> 07:00.453
{\an5}What's good?
Like, you know
what I'm sayin'?

07:00.520 --> 07:02.722
{\an1}Oh, no!
Don't cry, App!

07:02.789 --> 07:04.824
{\an1}Come here.
No.

07:04.891 --> 07:08.094
{\an5}(Apple)
If my dad was able to leave me,
how can I trust him right now?

07:08.161 --> 07:09.729
I was the one
that was looking for him,

07:09.796 --> 07:11.697
and he never, ever tried
to find me.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.634
{\an1}It's uncomfortable bein'
around him, low-key, you know?

07:14.700 --> 07:17.470
{\an4}I think if you have
that opportunity
to sit with him

07:17.537 --> 07:19.405
{\an1}and get the answers
that you're looking for,

07:19.472 --> 07:22.809
{\an4}that you should
definitely take
that opportunity again.

Ever since I met Akbar,

07:43.229 --> 07:45.231
he's been helping me
become a better me.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.768
{\an8}I mean, we've been in the studio
working on music together.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.703
And on top of all of that,

07:50.770 --> 07:53.773
he's an excellent
personal trainer.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.942
I know my friends are trying
to help me out,

07:56.008 --> 07:58.244
warning me about Akbar.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.848
{\an8}But he sat across the table,
looked me dead in my eyes,

08:01.914 --> 08:04.317
and said that he wasn't dealing
with any other woman.

08:04.383 --> 08:07.420
You know, relationships are
built on trust,

08:07.486 --> 08:09.522
and Akbar is the man
that I love,

08:09.589 --> 08:11.557
so I have to trust him.

08:14.594 --> 08:17.330
{\an8}♪♪

08:17.396 --> 08:19.665
{\an8}Miss Valentine,
you looking like
a snack, okay?

08:19.732 --> 08:21.400
Post-surgery?

08:19.732 --> 08:21.400
{\an3}(sighing)

08:21.467 --> 08:23.970
I feel better.
Recovery has been great.

08:24.036 --> 08:26.405
{\an8}I haven't seen my girl Bridget
since before

08:26.472 --> 08:29.442
{\an8}my lump removal surgery,
and all of that drama

08:29.508 --> 08:31.510
{\an8}with Marcus's Bimbo Barbie
went down.

08:31.577 --> 08:33.346
{\an8}So, I'm glad
she invited me out

08:33.412 --> 08:35.414
{\an8}for this little
makeover moment, honey,

08:35.481 --> 08:37.616
'cause it's a lot we need
to catch up on.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.284
{\an1}What is goin' on with you
and Marcus, though?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.419
{\an1}'Cause last I checked,
y'all were not together.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.456
It still might
be complicated,

08:43.522 --> 08:45.057
because, um...
(clears throat)

08:45.124 --> 08:47.960
I invited his girlfriend
to my house, and, um--

08:48.027 --> 08:50.229
{\an4}Why?!

08:48.027 --> 08:50.229
I just wanted to talk
to her, Bridget.

08:50.296 --> 08:51.464
{\an4}Bruh!

08:50.296 --> 08:51.464
Listen!
And like clockwork,

08:51.530 --> 08:53.900
{\an5}here he come
through the door
with his key.

08:53.966 --> 08:56.502
{\an5}And I'm like, "Baby,
tell your girlfriend
that it's over."

08:56.569 --> 08:58.004
And, you know,
on her way out,

08:58.070 --> 08:59.805
she gon' tell me
she might be pregnant.

08:59.872 --> 09:00.840
Wait. What?

09:00.907 --> 09:02.708
That's what I said.

09:02.775 --> 09:04.977
{\an1}So, you know, I had to pop up
at the clinic, you know?

09:05.044 --> 09:06.679
It's like,
"What we doin', girl?"

09:06.746 --> 09:08.247
But, girl, no,
she wasn't pregnant.

09:08.314 --> 09:09.815
So, we dismissed her.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.651
{\an5}We left her right
at that clinic.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.651
{\an1}"We"?

09:11.717 --> 09:13.252
{\an4}Okay, but what is Marcus
saying to you?

09:11.717 --> 09:13.252
{\an3}Okay?

09:13.319 --> 09:15.154
{\an1}Is Marcus still on board
to be with you?

09:15.221 --> 09:16.889
Check this out, Bridget.

09:16.956 --> 09:18.624
I got a plan in mind,

09:18.691 --> 09:20.493
and I kind of need
your help.

09:20.559 --> 09:23.095
{\an5}Oh, (bleep).

09:20.559 --> 09:23.095
You gon' help me out, girl?

09:23.162 --> 09:24.997
{\an1}You know I got you.
It's just I'm a little nervous.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.799
That's a real friend
right there!

09:26.866 --> 09:27.934
She don't even know
what I'm up to,

09:28.000 --> 09:29.035
but she wanna
help me do it.

09:29.101 --> 09:30.469
I'm here! I'm here!
I'm here!

09:30.536 --> 09:32.104
I'm here! I'm here! I'm here!
I'm here! I'm here!

09:32.171 --> 09:33.306
{\an5}(cheering)

09:32.171 --> 09:33.306
{\an1}You late for your appointment
or what, girl?

09:33.372 --> 09:35.074
{\an1}Right! Hella late!
We been in here mad long.

09:35.141 --> 09:36.609
{\an5}(Paris)
Okay, make me look
like "Peyoncé."

09:36.676 --> 09:37.743
{\an3}Oh, yes!

09:37.810 --> 09:39.178
{\an1}"Peyoncé"!

09:39.245 --> 09:40.680
{\an1}Yeah!

09:39.245 --> 09:40.680
You know?

09:40.746 --> 09:42.381
{\an5}(Paris)
After all this drama
I done found out

09:42.448 --> 09:44.684
{\an8}with Teairra and Akbar,

09:44.750 --> 09:47.954
and his not-so-secret wife,
I'm stressed out.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.822
So, a girls' day is
exactly what I needed,

09:49.889 --> 09:51.223
'cause I need to figure out what
I'm gon' do about this.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.025
What's goin' on?

09:53.092 --> 09:54.827
Girl, y'all know Teairra.
That's one of my good friends.

09:54.894 --> 09:57.964
{\an4}Yeah.

09:54.894 --> 09:57.964
She's datin' this guy,
right now, named Akbar.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.232
{\an4}The light-skinned dude
with the light eyes?

09:58.030 --> 10:00.232
Yeah.

10:00.299 --> 10:02.034
{\an5}So, basically...

10:00.299 --> 10:02.034
Mmm, oh, Lord.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.303
{\an5}...I went to look
on blogs and stuff.
I see that he has a wife.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.839
She's like, "Ooh, no, he talked
to me about it, girl."

10:06.906 --> 10:08.641
{\an5}Like, "Just stay out of it.
It's not what you think."

10:06.906 --> 10:08.641
What'd he say?

10:08.708 --> 10:11.344
{\an5}Basically, I guess he
told her it's not true,
they not together.

10:11.410 --> 10:12.478
So I reached out to the girl.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.480
I set up a whole meeting.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.615
The girl name is Sade.
I'm asking her questions like,

10:16.682 --> 10:18.985
"Hey, I'm looking at your page.
Like, are you married?"

10:19.051 --> 10:20.486
She's like, "Yeah, I been
married for six years."

10:20.553 --> 10:21.821
{\an6}Ooh!

10:20.553 --> 10:21.821
Okay.

10:21.887 --> 10:23.689
"I see that you're dealing
with someone

10:23.756 --> 10:26.325
that's messing with my friend,"
and she was like,

10:26.392 --> 10:27.927
{\an5}"I ain't gotta answer to you!"
Like, she just started
going crazy on me.

10:27.994 --> 10:29.462
Feisty! Feisty!
Defensive.

10:29.528 --> 10:31.364
I don't know if she know
about Teairra,

10:31.430 --> 10:34.000
{\an5}but what I do know is,
they're still together
and they're still married.

10:34.066 --> 10:35.868
{\an1}Oh, God, give me another
painkiller to go with this.

10:35.935 --> 10:37.370
But right now, I don't know how
I'ma tell her about this.

10:37.436 --> 10:39.538
{\an1}Well, when you tell her that,
tell her this.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.107
That's the homey.

10:41.173 --> 10:43.342
{\an1}I've been watching him
do his thing for five years.

10:43.409 --> 10:45.878
He dated two
of my friends.

10:45.945 --> 10:48.347
Yes, Akbar and his games
is nothing new to Brooke.

10:48.414 --> 10:51.217
I met him about
five years ago.

10:51.283 --> 10:53.219
He even tried to put
his little charm on me.

10:53.285 --> 10:56.956
But I've seen that he has
no shortage of women around him.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.190
I know his game.

10:58.257 --> 11:00.426
I ran into Akbar
about a month ago.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.161
{\an5}Oh, God.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.161
But listen.
With this chick.

11:02.228 --> 11:03.429
She's like,
"You know this bitch?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.830
Why you talking
to my man?"

11:04.897 --> 11:06.766
He was like, "Stand down!"
You know what I mean?

11:06.832 --> 11:08.300
So it gotta be this girl
right here.

11:08.367 --> 11:09.735
{\an3}No.

11:09.802 --> 11:11.504
She not even that color.

11:11.570 --> 11:14.607
The girl Paris just showed me
is chocolate, okay?

11:14.673 --> 11:19.512
And the girl I saw Akbar with
was definitely light caramel.

11:19.578 --> 11:22.114
{\an5}So she's not the wife.

11:19.578 --> 11:22.114
{\an3}But listen.

11:22.181 --> 11:25.117
This chick that I saw,
she had her MDE shirt on.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.552
That's his little brand
or whatever.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.754
{\an1}We was at the cafe right by
the gym that he owns.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.523
So I gotta go undercover
on her now.

11:30.589 --> 11:31.991
{\an1}Where is Teairra
in all this?

11:32.058 --> 11:33.492
Like, how does Teairra
not know any of this?

11:33.559 --> 11:35.061
I believe
she's blindsided.

11:35.127 --> 11:37.096
{\an1}You gotta get all the info, P,
before you go to Teairra.

11:37.163 --> 11:39.398
So that mean I gotta go
to the gym?

11:39.465 --> 11:41.167
(laughter)

11:41.233 --> 11:42.401
Shh! Uh...

11:43.869 --> 11:44.937
{\an8}How do you feel?

11:48.240 --> 11:49.508
{\an8}How much
are you charging?

11:49.575 --> 11:51.143
{\an8}What about 100,000?

11:51.210 --> 11:53.012
{\an7}Ooh!

11:53.079 --> 11:54.713
{\an8}Welcome to the jungle.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.549
{\an7}It's your marriage,
but just think about it, bro.

11:56.615 --> 11:59.485
{\an8}Brooke is crazy,
but she's not a liar, bro.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.187
{\an8}Don't come in here and ask me
what the (bleep) is going on.

12:01.253 --> 12:03.489
{\an7}I'm grown.

12:01.253 --> 12:03.489
{\an8}Don't call my mama no bitch.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.590
{\an9}Yo!

12:03.556 --> 12:04.590
{\an7}Bitch!

12:04.657 --> 12:06.092
{\an8}Ohh! What the--

12:23.776 --> 12:25.277
{\an3}Perfect.

12:25.344 --> 12:27.413
I still can't believe
how things went left

12:27.480 --> 12:29.181
at Donatella's showcase.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.851
And seeing Lyrica defend me
against Roccstar?

12:31.917 --> 12:33.819
Man, that's got me
really conflicted

12:33.886 --> 12:35.187
about my feelings for her.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.956
I need somebody to talk to,

12:37.022 --> 12:39.892
and I know my boy Marcus has
his own drama going on,

12:39.959 --> 12:41.994
so I called him down
to my video shoot

12:42.061 --> 12:43.629
so we could hash things out.

12:43.696 --> 12:44.763
So, what's good, man?

12:44.830 --> 12:48.033
You about to be
a daddy or what?

12:48.100 --> 12:49.401
{\an3}(sighing)
No, bro.

12:49.468 --> 12:51.537
{\an1}Word?

12:49.468 --> 12:51.537
{\an3}Man.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.539
{\an7}Ooh!

12:51.604 --> 12:53.539
{\an8}We went down
to the doctor's office.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.841
It's no baby.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.841
{\an1}Mmm.

12:55.908 --> 12:57.143
So, Brooke pull up.

12:57.209 --> 12:58.577
Brooke throw a pack
of condoms at her.

12:58.644 --> 13:01.547
{\an1}Oh.

12:58.644 --> 13:01.547
Stassi break up with me.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.449
Reality is, she kind of
beat me to the punch,

13:03.516 --> 13:05.851
{\an8}'cause I felt like this
situation wasn't goin'.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.753
{\an7}It wasn't goin' nowhere.
Plus, I need-- I'm trying--

13:07.820 --> 13:10.422
{\an8}I'm trying to get back
to baby anyway,
and just, you know...

13:10.489 --> 13:12.358
You want to go
to Crazy Land?

13:12.424 --> 13:13.792
I like Brooke type
of crazy.

13:13.859 --> 13:17.329
{\an1}Not only do I plan
on goin' back to Crazy Land,

13:17.396 --> 13:19.131
{\an5}I plan on takin'
this whole thing
to the next level.

13:19.198 --> 13:22.234
{\an5}Next level?

13:19.198 --> 13:22.234
I mean, you know...

13:22.301 --> 13:23.569
What I'ma tell you
is this.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.005
She say she planned,
like, a nice, romantic,

13:26.071 --> 13:28.574
weekend getaway for us,
you know what I'm sayin'?

13:28.641 --> 13:29.975
Nice hotel suite.

13:30.042 --> 13:32.044
I think I'm finally about
to get that honey bun.

13:32.111 --> 13:33.679
You feel me?

13:33.746 --> 13:35.047
Speaking of relationships,
though, you know,

13:35.114 --> 13:37.116
what's up with you
and, uh, that Lyrica?

13:37.183 --> 13:40.052
{\an1}Last time I seen her,
I had went to a showcase.

13:40.119 --> 13:41.654
Lyrica, she end up

13:41.720 --> 13:44.156
{\an1}almost gettin' into
a squabble with La'Britney.

13:44.223 --> 13:47.593
{\an1}And then Roccstar over there
trying to move in

13:47.660 --> 13:50.496
{\an1}on my situation and trying
to work with Lyrica.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.765
{\an1}So me and him
almost get into a fight.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.934
{\an5}You fixin' to fight
old boy?

13:52.831 --> 13:54.934
{\an1}Yeah, bro.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.836
I gotta admit,
even though we goin' through it,

13:57.903 --> 14:00.706
Lyrica showed her loyalty
by standing next to me

14:00.773 --> 14:02.308
when things got out of hand
with Roccstar.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.243
And that's got me
taking a second look

14:04.310 --> 14:05.644
at the issues we been having.

14:05.711 --> 14:07.746
{\an1}Lyrica been hitting me up
since then,

14:07.813 --> 14:09.982
{\an1}you know what I'm sayin',
tryin' to talk.

14:10.049 --> 14:11.317
{\an3}About what?

14:11.383 --> 14:13.352
{\an1}And a piece of me
wanna go hear her out,

14:13.419 --> 14:15.087
you know what I'm sayin',
see what she got to say.

14:15.154 --> 14:16.455
{\an1}It's your marriage,
but just think about it, bro.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.491
Brooke is crazy,
but she's not a liar, bro.

14:19.558 --> 14:21.327
Just think about it
'fore you dive back in.

14:21.393 --> 14:23.362
You know what I'm sayin'?

14:25.831 --> 14:28.534
{\an8}♪♪

14:28.601 --> 14:32.838
A couple nights ago, I seen
this chocolate Godiva bar.

14:32.905 --> 14:35.774
I'm like,
"Yo, how do I get that alone?"

14:35.841 --> 14:37.977
She said she's a singer,
so, you know,

14:38.043 --> 14:41.313
we agreed to link up
and talk about some music.

14:41.380 --> 14:45.084
Or really just...
hit it from the back.

14:45.150 --> 14:46.118
{\an6}Hey!

14:45.150 --> 14:46.118
You see what
I'm sayin'?

14:46.185 --> 14:48.621
{\an3}(laughing)

14:46.185 --> 14:48.621
{\an1}Hey!

14:48.687 --> 14:51.724
{\an8}Let me reintroduce myself
as Amber Diamond, the singer.

14:51.790 --> 14:54.326
{\an8}Everybody knows me
as Cisco's ex-girlfriend,

14:54.393 --> 14:56.695
but I'm here to do my music.

14:56.762 --> 14:58.731
So, when I met
the producer Roccstar,

14:58.797 --> 15:00.366
I thought this could be
my big break.

15:00.432 --> 15:02.835
A girl's gotta hustle any way
that she can, right?

15:02.901 --> 15:04.570
{\an5}Thank you for coming.

15:02.901 --> 15:04.570
Yeah, of course.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.206
{\an5}I really appreciate it, yeah.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.206
{\an1}You know I had
to come see you.

15:07.273 --> 15:08.741
{\an7}So, what's the play like?
Is--

15:08.807 --> 15:11.410
{\an7}Do we have to worry about
a boyfriend showing up
like, "Yo"?

15:11.477 --> 15:13.012
{\an3}No.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.012
We ain't gonna?

15:13.078 --> 15:14.480
I been just focusing
on my work right now.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.482
{\an5}I've been working
on my music,
and I really,

15:16.548 --> 15:17.950
really been wanting
to work with you.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.752
{\an5}That's right.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.752
'Cause I thought
you could help me

15:19.818 --> 15:21.420
take my music where
it needs to go, you know?

15:21.487 --> 15:23.622
{\an5}Yeah, I'm with it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:21.487 --> 15:23.622
So, how can we do that?

15:23.689 --> 15:25.190
{\an1}Well, I mean,
we gotta figure out,

15:25.257 --> 15:28.093
{\an1}how do we get
the compensation compensated?

15:28.160 --> 15:31.730
Um, I actually invited
my manager.

15:31.797 --> 15:34.266
I may look
like Amber's sister,

15:34.333 --> 15:38.237
{\an8}but I'm her mom and manager,
Shun mother(bleep) Love.

15:38.304 --> 15:40.439
{\an5}Hi.

15:38.304 --> 15:40.439
{\an3}Hi!

15:38.304 --> 15:40.439
{\an1}Hey!

15:40.506 --> 15:43.575
This is my manager.
So, she's my mom.

15:43.642 --> 15:45.010
Oh! "Momager"?

15:45.077 --> 15:48.180
I'm a promoter, manager,
and a hustler.

15:48.247 --> 15:49.381
And when Amber came to me,

15:49.448 --> 15:51.050
talking about
this producer she met,

15:51.116 --> 15:53.052
I had to do my homework.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.921
I found out Roccstar
was the real deal,

15:55.988 --> 15:58.490
so I know exactly what to do
with him.

15:58.557 --> 16:00.893
{\an1}I'm trying to figure out how
I can make her a star.

16:00.959 --> 16:04.863
{\an4}Okay.

16:00.959 --> 16:04.863
So, I'm trying to, you know,
get her an EP done, you know?

16:04.930 --> 16:06.999
{\an5}Okay, well, you came
to the right place.

16:04.930 --> 16:06.999
{\an3}Really?

16:07.066 --> 16:09.401
{\an5}Yeah, absolutely.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.401
How much are you charging?

16:09.468 --> 16:11.837
You know, what--
what's the procedure?

16:11.904 --> 16:13.972
{\an1}Okay, what about 100,000
for a track?

16:14.039 --> 16:15.407
A hundred bands
for a track?

16:15.474 --> 16:17.476
{\an5}For one track?

16:15.474 --> 16:17.476
{\an1}What y'all got?
'Cause I love Amber.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.812
{\an4}I'ma just-- I don't care
what y'all talking 'bout.
I'm with you.

16:19.878 --> 16:21.680
{\an5}We just gon' get it done.

16:19.878 --> 16:21.680
Okay, well, it ain't
about what I got.

16:21.747 --> 16:24.149
{\an5}How 'bout that?

16:21.747 --> 16:24.149
Okay, so we gon' go
with what's in my purse.

16:24.216 --> 16:26.919
{\an1}Oh, (bleep)!
Oh, you out here like that?

16:26.985 --> 16:29.088
{\an1}Dang! Okay.
So, that's what you want.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.824
{\an5}I like your style.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.824
I ain't puttin' my money
back in my pocket.

16:31.890 --> 16:32.958
{\an5}I'm puttin' it over there.

16:31.890 --> 16:32.958
{\an1}Ooh!

16:33.025 --> 16:35.227
{\an5}There you go.

16:33.025 --> 16:35.227
Welcome to the jungle!

16:35.294 --> 16:37.196
{\an1}Hey, listen.
Watch out.

16:37.262 --> 16:38.831
Hello? Yeah.

16:37.262 --> 16:38.831
{\an3}Yeah.

16:38.897 --> 16:40.265
Is this the studio?

16:40.332 --> 16:42.868
Now, when the momager joined
our little lunch date,

16:42.935 --> 16:45.904
I mean, my plans with Amber
changed dramatically.

16:45.971 --> 16:50.175
But I guess 20 racks
for an hour of my time

16:50.242 --> 16:51.910
isn't a bad day's work.

16:51.977 --> 16:53.479
{\an3}That's 20.

16:51.977 --> 16:53.479
{\an1}Okay.

16:53.545 --> 16:56.682
{\an1}Okay, and once it's complete,
I'll give you the other 20.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.283
Is that fair?

16:56.749 --> 16:58.283
{\an1}Yeah.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.853
{\an5}For the song, right?

16:58.350 --> 17:00.853
{\an3}For the EP.

17:00.919 --> 17:03.255
EP is seven songs.

17:00.919 --> 17:03.255
{\an3}So...

17:03.322 --> 17:06.157
{\an5}So, you sayin' you gon'
charge me 40 bands
for one song?

17:06.224 --> 17:07.659
For the record.

17:09.127 --> 17:12.164
I need to understand what is
gonna come with this money.

17:12.231 --> 17:14.433
{\an4}You get that single
that's gon' take you
to the moon,

17:14.500 --> 17:16.201
we top 40, "Billboard."

17:14.500 --> 17:16.201
{\an3}Okay.

17:16.268 --> 17:18.002
And I also wanna make sure

17:18.069 --> 17:20.305
ain't nobody trying
to (bleep) her, you know?

17:20.372 --> 17:22.473
{\an1}Okay, that's definitely
understood.

17:22.540 --> 17:23.509
{\an1}We on.

17:22.540 --> 17:23.509
{\an3}Yeah?

17:23.575 --> 17:24.810
{\an1}Yeah.

17:23.575 --> 17:24.810
{\an3}All right.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.279
I'ma hold my breath.
Don't let me die.

17:34.353 --> 17:36.455
(indistinct chatter)

17:38.257 --> 17:40.793
So, how do you feel?

17:47.666 --> 17:50.402
{\an8}(Kimberly)
After two years
of being in pain,

17:50.469 --> 17:53.772
{\an8}not being able to walk,
aching every day,

17:53.839 --> 17:55.908
it's finally come down
to this moment

17:55.974 --> 17:58.310
where I'm about
to be healthy again.

17:58.377 --> 18:02.314
I'm so nervous because this is
a major surgery,

18:02.381 --> 18:04.550
the most major surgery

When I wake up
from this surgery,

18:39.518 --> 18:42.554
I know for a fact
I'm gonna be in pain.

18:42.621 --> 18:46.358
But I also know
that it's the beginning

18:46.425 --> 18:50.863
and the start of acceptance

18:58.637 --> 19:00.973
{\an7}What do you want

18:58.637 --> 19:00.973
{\an5}I just wanna figure out

19:01.039 --> 19:03.775
{\an8}what the hell happened
when I was younger.

19:03.842 --> 19:05.744
{\an8}I somewhat have
an explanation

19:05.811 --> 19:09.081
{\an8}as to why my emotions
have been everywhere.

19:16.555 --> 19:21.226
{\an8}♪♪

19:25.330 --> 19:28.166
Just because I connected
with my dad a few years ago,

19:28.233 --> 19:30.736
it's still taking me a second
to open up to him.

19:30.802 --> 19:34.072
I'm still hurt from my past,
and I'm wondering to myself,

19:34.139 --> 19:36.241
"Why is he trying to have
a relationship now?"

19:36.308 --> 19:38.310
So, how things going?

19:38.377 --> 19:40.145
Everything goin'
all right.

19:40.212 --> 19:41.847
{\an7}You haven't really
been calling me.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.515
{\an7}You haven't been
texting me.

19:43.582 --> 19:45.817
{\an1}Call you up and just kicking it
and doin' all that,

19:45.884 --> 19:47.486
that's not something
I'm just used to.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.657
{\an1}So, you have to tell me
what it is.

19:51.723 --> 19:53.492
{\an7}What do you want
from me?

19:53.559 --> 19:56.028
{\an8}I just wanna figure out
what the hell happened
when I was younger,

19:56.094 --> 19:57.462
how I got in the system,
et cetera.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.998
{\an5}Because it wasn't me.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.998
You say it wasn't you,

20:00.065 --> 20:01.833
but you could've got me.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.302
And you went on
with your life

20:03.368 --> 20:05.637
{\an5}and had four other kids?

20:03.368 --> 20:05.637
{\an1}Later.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.072
That's kind of unfair
that they was raised

20:07.139 --> 20:09.374
the way they, like,
had you in their life,

20:09.441 --> 20:13.445
and then I just was lost
in the system. It sucks.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.847
{\an1}Okay, but I never knew you was
in the system until you told me.

20:15.914 --> 20:17.482
{\an5}But you knew that--

20:15.914 --> 20:17.482
{\an1}You never would've been
in the system.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.751
{\an1}You would've came and moved,
I would've taken you

20:19.818 --> 20:21.587
{\an1}all the way to my home.
I had a home.

20:21.653 --> 20:23.722
{\an1}But if you care about somebody,
you stay with them.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.691
You help 'em,
period.

20:25.757 --> 20:26.892
You left me.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.163
{\an1}I don't want to try
to make this hard for you.

20:31.229 --> 20:32.364
{\an1}I don't want
to make it hard for me.

20:32.431 --> 20:34.266
{\an1}But I just want you
to understand.

20:34.333 --> 20:35.767
I would love,

20:35.834 --> 20:38.337
{\an1}love for you
to be my daughter.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.606
{\an5}(Apple)
I know my trust issues
come from my dad,

20:40.672 --> 20:42.274
because he slept with my mother

20:42.341 --> 20:44.343
and still walked away from her
and left a baby.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.144
You left me
in the foster care system,

20:46.211 --> 20:47.946
and you raised four other kids?

20:48.013 --> 20:50.048
He can't expect me
to forget my past

20:50.115 --> 20:53.151
and just let him come back
in my life like it's okay.

20:53.218 --> 20:55.287
So, do you want to build
a relationship with me?

20:55.354 --> 20:56.722
I want to build
a relationship,

20:56.788 --> 20:57.856
but I'm just
a little scarred

20:57.923 --> 20:59.591
{\an5}from when I was a kid.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.591
What can I do?

20:59.658 --> 21:02.027
{\an5}I'm gonna get some
mental help, literally.

20:59.658 --> 21:02.027
{\an1}Okay.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.162
{\an5}'Cause I'm gonna need
help expressing the
stuff that I need.

21:04.229 --> 21:06.932
{\an1}Okay, I will pay for us
to go see a psychiatrist.

21:06.999 --> 21:11.203
{\an4}Hopefully, we can
work through all of this
so we can move forward.

21:11.269 --> 21:12.671
{\an1}We can't change the past
but at least we can...

21:14.506 --> 21:17.476
{\an7}I know that I'm gonna
need to help you let it go.

21:17.542 --> 21:20.012
All this difficult stuff
that happened in my past

21:20.078 --> 21:23.215
inspires me to be better
and grind harder

21:23.281 --> 21:25.183
and work on my music,
and hopefully,

21:25.250 --> 21:26.485
it pushes me to be great.

21:26.551 --> 21:29.187
It was hard for me
to even come out to you

21:29.254 --> 21:30.589
{\an5}to tell you how I feel,
you know?

21:29.254 --> 21:30.589
{\an1}Yeah.

21:30.656 --> 21:32.190
And there's a lot more
I want to talk about.

21:32.257 --> 21:33.959
A lot of stuff
is bottled in.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.894
{\an1}But the more time we spend,
the more you will share with me.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.229
{\an6}Yeah.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.229
You've got to open up.

21:37.295 --> 21:38.463
{\an3}All right.

21:39.798 --> 21:43.201
{\an8}♪♪

21:43.268 --> 21:47.572
{\an8}This place that A1 and I have
gotten to is really foreign

21:47.639 --> 21:50.042
{\an8}and I do not like it.
Since we fell out,

21:50.108 --> 21:53.078
{\an8}he's been staying at a hotel.
We don't even see each other.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.515
He's been ignoring my texts
up until now.

22:00.185 --> 22:03.055
What's good?

22:00.185 --> 22:03.055
{\an3}Hey.

22:03.121 --> 22:04.690
{\an1}(sighs)

22:05.924 --> 22:08.193
I really wanted you
to come over here

22:08.260 --> 22:11.630
{\an5}because I feel like all
this has gone too far,
you know what I'm saying?

22:11.697 --> 22:16.535
{\an5}Like, our last argument
was a total embarrassment
to ourselves.

22:16.601 --> 22:18.036
We've never talked
to each other like that.

22:18.103 --> 22:20.906
And what really
irks me the most

22:20.972 --> 22:24.743
{\an5}is that this stems
from a rumor that
K. Michelle made up.

22:24.810 --> 22:30.115
{\an4}Yeah, all right.
I'll be man enough to say
what she said bothered me.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.817
I felt so mad that you
could even think about

22:31.883 --> 22:33.085
believing something
like that,

22:33.151 --> 22:35.220
so I'm gonna look you
in your eyes

22:35.287 --> 22:38.623
and tell you
once and for all,

22:38.690 --> 22:40.892
me and Safaree
never had sex.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.527
Nothing ever happened
between me and Safaree.

22:42.594 --> 22:45.497
{\an5}This is not true.

22:42.594 --> 22:45.497
I respect that.

22:45.564 --> 22:49.835
{\an5}Finally. If I had just
gotten a real answer like
this in the first place,

22:49.901 --> 22:52.304
we could have avoided
all this foolishness.

22:52.370 --> 22:55.407
{\an1}It's about what you
just did, to be honest.

22:55.474 --> 22:58.009
{\an1}Like, look me in my eyes.
Look, no.

22:58.076 --> 22:59.111
You get what I'm saying?

22:59.177 --> 23:01.880
{\an1}Like, I'm human.
I let it get to me.

23:01.947 --> 23:05.617
{\an4}I'm up here, trippin',
trying to fight my brother,
you know what I'm saying?

23:05.684 --> 23:11.523
{\an4}Safaree, Roccstar.
Like, by the way,
what's up with that?

23:11.590 --> 23:14.960
{\an4}Like, you up there,
slapping, high-five BFFs.
I'm just like...

23:15.026 --> 23:17.896
{\an5}And when it got crazy,
I had your back.

23:15.026 --> 23:17.896
{\an1}You did.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.498
And I haven't
talked to him since.

23:19.564 --> 23:23.068
{\an4}I don't even know
how you and old girl
ended up getting into it.

23:23.135 --> 23:28.106
{\an5}I was really confused,
but anybody... you
know what I'm saying?

23:28.173 --> 23:32.177
{\an1}...who's gonna be
disrespectful to my wife,

23:32.244 --> 23:34.346
{\an5}I'm not working with 'em.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.346
I appreciate that.

23:34.412 --> 23:36.615
I cannot tell you
how good it feels

23:36.681 --> 23:39.551
to finally be done with
all this misunderstanding

23:39.618 --> 23:41.419
and all this
not trusting each other

23:41.486 --> 23:44.122
so we can finally put
this bull(bleep) to bed.

23:44.189 --> 23:50.695
{\an4}Well, I am happy to know
that we're on the same page
and, you know, I love you.

23:50.762 --> 23:52.164
{\an5}I love you too.

23:50.762 --> 23:52.164
I don't want to be
with nobody else.

23:52.230 --> 23:55.734
I want you home,
and I just feel like...

23:55.801 --> 23:59.371
Honestly, I have somewhat
of an explanation

23:59.437 --> 24:03.008
as to why my emotions
have been everywhere.

24:10.949 --> 24:13.652

24:15.387 --> 24:20.125
{\an3}Yeah.

24:20.192 --> 24:23.195
A lot about to change.

24:23.261 --> 24:25.263
Having a baby
has been something

24:25.330 --> 24:28.433
{\an5}that A1 and I
started talking about
within the past year.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.202
A1 and I have
been through a lot,

24:30.268 --> 24:32.537

to finally be back

24:32.604 --> 24:34.272
in a good place
with each other.

24:34.339 --> 24:36.641
Who have you told?

24:34.339 --> 24:36.641
{\an3}Nobody.

24:36.708 --> 24:38.677
{\an5}I couldn't wait for...

24:36.708 --> 24:38.677
You ain't told your mama?

24:38.743 --> 24:40.145
No, I have not told
my mom.

24:40.212 --> 24:42.681
{\an1}I want to tell my mama
and my brother.

24:42.747 --> 24:44.549
So, how do you think
we should do it?

24:44.616 --> 24:46.518
How do you think we
should tell 'em the news?

24:49.020 --> 24:51.089
I'm super excited
about being a dad,

24:51.156 --> 24:54.059
but telling my family
is a bit tricky.

24:54.125 --> 25:00.298
{\an5}Lyrica ain't exactly on
the favorite list of my mom,
my brother, and his wife.

25:00.365 --> 25:02.534
They complain that she
don't act like a sister

25:02.601 --> 25:04.436
and that she turning me
Hollywood,

25:04.502 --> 25:08.640
{\an5}but hopefully this
good news can help
everyone get past that.

25:08.707 --> 25:10.075
It's gotta be,
like, dinner.

25:10.141 --> 25:11.576

Everybody loves to eat.

25:13.578 --> 25:15.347
I think we start there

25:15.413 --> 25:18.416
{\an5}and then we see
where that go.

25:15.413 --> 25:18.416
{\an3}Yes.

ridiculous!

It's been a few days
since I had my surgery

25:43.041 --> 25:44.042
to remove the silicone,

25:44.109 --> 25:46.945
and I've never experienced

25:47.012 --> 25:49.281
such hell and pain
in my life.

25:49.347 --> 25:52.083
Moniece has checked on me
every single day,

25:52.150 --> 25:53.718
and she turned out to be

25:53.785 --> 25:56.054
one of my biggest supporters
through this surgery.

25:56.121 --> 25:58.924
{\an4}Oh, Lord.

25:56.121 --> 25:58.924
So, how are you feeling?

25:58.990 --> 26:00.625
I'ma show you something.

26:00.692 --> 26:05.830
{\an1}I've had scars from people
all my life,

26:05.897 --> 26:09.034
but to have a scar that
is never going to heal

26:09.100 --> 26:14.873
{\an8}and I have to look
at it every day...

26:09.100 --> 26:14.873
{\an9}Aw, K....

26:14.940 --> 26:16.908
And all for what?

26:16.975 --> 26:19.110
{\an7}Like, I was sick
for a year.

26:19.177 --> 26:24.249
{\an7}Can even go onstage
or even... even live life.

26:24.316 --> 26:27.686

{\an5}(Moniece)
I know what Kimberly's
talking about.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.959
I felt the pressure
to look a certain way.

26:34.025 --> 26:35.860
I've had
a breast augmentation

26:35.927 --> 26:38.096
and gone through a few
complications of my own,

26:38.163 --> 26:40.598
and there are definitely times
that I wish I hadn't done it.

26:40.665 --> 26:42.567
Eventually, hopefully,
you know,

26:42.634 --> 26:45.070
you can get to
a place where this scar

26:45.136 --> 26:49.207
{\an5}is a reminder that
you've overcome
yet something else,

26:49.274 --> 26:53.411
{\an5}and I want you to know
that you're affecting
people in a positive way.

26:53.478 --> 26:57.115
{\an4}This situation
showed me so many
people and their faces,

26:57.182 --> 27:00.352
and it was people who,
I have paid their rent,

27:00.418 --> 27:02.187
I have made them famous.

27:02.253 --> 27:05.757

they was nowhere for me,
and I hate them.

who's really there for you
when they just need you,

27:15.433 --> 27:17.836
and who's gonna be there
when you need them.

27:17.902 --> 27:20.238
I learned my lesson
and it wasn't pretty.

forgive for yourself,
not for them.

liking the song,

{\an8}I must have
a lot of talent.

28:44.489 --> 28:46.458

No, that really means
a lot, 'cause it's like,

28:50.929 --> 28:53.331

knows that I can,
like, really sing.

{\an1}they hear that...

29:12.984 --> 29:14.953
I'm just hoping

my biggest critic.

29:16.621 --> 29:18.723
{\an5}Like, she literally...

29:16.621 --> 29:18.723
Mom has got to like it...

29:18.790 --> 29:20.225
{\an8}Like, I'm just happy
that she wasn't

29:20.291 --> 29:22.293
{\an8}at this session 'cause if
she was in this session,

29:22.360 --> 29:24.929

29:22.360 --> 29:24.929
It would have gone so far.

29:24.996 --> 29:27.098
Don't get me wrong.
Everything that my mom,

29:27.165 --> 29:31.236
{\an5}like, does, is for
the best, I guess.

29:27.165 --> 29:31.236
{\an1}Right.

29:31.302 --> 29:33.104
{\an5}But it's just like,
there's a certain way
you do things,

29:33.171 --> 29:36.541
{\an5}'cause you know, like,
the way she talks to me
is not good sometimes.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.377
{\an5}She be calling me
on my name.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.377
{\an1}Oh, she's going
to the moon.

29:39.444 --> 29:42.647
{\an5}Yeah, doing the most.
She even ran away
a couple of guys.

29:42.714 --> 29:44.782
Oh, no, not the guys!

29:44.849 --> 29:46.751
Yeah. She's ran away
a couple guys.

29:46.818 --> 29:48.453
It's gone too far now.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.588
It's like my mom
literally tries to control

29:50.655 --> 29:52.524
everything that I do.
That's why it's like,

29:52.590 --> 29:55.059
{\an5}it's hard to separate
manager from mom.

29:52.590 --> 29:55.059
{\an1}I know.

29:55.126 --> 29:56.995

29:57.061 --> 29:59.497
already planning
the cover, photo shoots.

{\an5}She's already planning
a single release party.

29:59.564 --> 30:03.001
{\an1}Oh, is she going
to the moon?

30:03.067 --> 30:05.436
I guess Amber is
so excited about the song,

30:05.503 --> 30:07.272
Mom already set up
her premiere party.

30:07.338 --> 30:08.773
It's, like, super sweet.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.176
I just need to add
this Roccstar beat

30:11.242 --> 30:16.648
{\an5}with some reverb,
a lot of Auto-Tune,
a EQ, a prayer...

30:16.714 --> 30:19.150
I mean, after all,
that's what Roccstars do.

30:19.217 --> 30:21.920
We put magic on tragic.

30:21.986 --> 30:23.321
{\an1}We just gotta
put this together.

30:23.388 --> 30:25.857

put some sauce on it.

30:23.388 --> 30:25.857
{\an3}Yeah.

30:25.924 --> 30:28.893
Swag it out, do my thing,
'cause you did your thing,

30:28.960 --> 30:31.396

30:28.960 --> 30:31.396

to be sexy time.

30:39.704 --> 30:41.906

I just be nude?

30:41.973 --> 30:43.241

What's his name?

30:43.308 --> 30:44.509
{\an8}His name is Akbar.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.077

30:46.144 --> 30:48.947

crazy ride, and that's good,

a lot of moving parts

that I definitely
need some help with.

31:35.159 --> 31:36.160
{\an1}I'm here now.
I'm here.

31:36.227 --> 31:37.462
{\an1}You have my
undivided attention.

31:37.528 --> 31:39.497
{\an1}I just was on the phone
with a travel agent,

31:39.564 --> 31:40.732
{\an1}trying to get
everything together.

31:40.798 --> 31:41.799
How are we looking
on the tickets?

31:41.866 --> 31:43.601
Tickets are booked.

31:41.866 --> 31:43.601
{\an3}Okay.

31:43.668 --> 31:45.036
And then everything else
is in place, right?

31:45.103 --> 31:46.237
You went
down the checklist?

31:46.304 --> 31:47.905
{\an1}Miss Laurie is giving me
a little pushback...

31:47.972 --> 31:49.907
Miss Laurie.

31:49.974 --> 31:51.342
'Cause she's asking
a lot of questions.

31:51.409 --> 31:52.744
{\an5}What should I tell her?

31:51.409 --> 31:52.744
I kind of don't

31:52.810 --> 31:54.412
have an answer for
that right now.

31:54.479 --> 31:55.847
Just get her here,
Bridget.

31:55.913 --> 31:58.116
{\an4}I'll just be like,
"Well, Brooke says..."

31:55.913 --> 31:58.116
{\an3}Please.

31:58.182 --> 32:03.354
{\an5}Tell her her baby
is performing live.
Uh, I don't know.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.323
He's gonna be
performing live, though.

32:05.390 --> 32:07.992
I bet you he is, okay?

32:08.059 --> 32:10.061
{\an8}After spending
almost a year

32:10.128 --> 32:12.730
{\an8}getting to know Brooke
Valentine inside and out,

32:12.797 --> 32:16.467
{\an8}I've come to the conclusion
that she is bat-(bleep) crazy

32:16.534 --> 32:18.369
and I'm happy to help her
make her dreams come true.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.271
{\an4}I want to see some
of these dresses on.
What else we got in here?

32:20.338 --> 32:23.441
I tried these on.
I don't really think so.

32:23.508 --> 32:24.909
{\an6}Eh...

32:23.508 --> 32:24.909
They're beautiful.
What's the problem?

32:24.976 --> 32:26.844
I mean, girl, it's
supposed to be sexy time.

32:26.911 --> 32:28.379
Shouldn't I just be nude?

32:28.446 --> 32:31.482
{\an1}Should you just be nude?
I don't know.

32:31.549 --> 32:33.618
I mean, I feel like you can
eventually end up that way,

32:33.685 --> 32:35.053
{\an4}but I don't think
we should start there.

32:33.685 --> 32:35.053
{\an3}Okay.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.722
{\an1}Let's not start nude, okay?
Let's not skip steps.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.357
What about that
black one over there?

32:39.424 --> 32:41.192
{\an1}Black?

32:39.424 --> 32:41.192
{\an3}Yeah.

32:41.259 --> 32:44.362
{\an4}You have to feel
your absolute sexiest
in this dress,

32:44.429 --> 32:46.297
{\an1}so if black is
gonna get you there...

32:46.364 --> 32:47.532
Give me
this dress, girl.

32:47.598 --> 32:48.733
{\an1}I'm trying to be
a team player.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.702
Yeah, I like it.
I like it.

32:50.768 --> 32:52.670
{\an5}If you're gonna be
confident and sexy in it,
then that's fine.

32:52.737 --> 32:54.739
{\an1}Just, you know, it's not
a lot of bells and whistles.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.641
{\an5}I feel like...

32:54.806 --> 32:56.641
Let me borrow your booty.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.209
{\an1}Okay, for the bells
and whistles.

32:58.276 --> 32:59.610
{\an1}It's a lot of bells,
a lot of whistles.

32:59.677 --> 33:01.479
Let me
try this on, okay?

33:01.546 --> 33:03.147
{\an5}I'ma change your mind
right now.

33:01.546 --> 33:03.147
{\an1}Okay.

33:03.214 --> 33:07.218
♪♪

33:11.622 --> 33:14.492
{\an5}(Paris)
See, Brooke told me that
Akbar's other <i> other</i> woman

33:14.559 --> 33:16.260
{\an8}works at a gym called MDE,

33:16.327 --> 33:18.596
{\an8}so it wasn't really
that hard to track down.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.765
Me and Nikki agreed to
link up at the spot,

33:20.832 --> 33:23.968
but I ain't running down
this girl unless Nikki's here.

33:24.035 --> 33:25.203
This girl look like
she ready to go.

33:25.269 --> 33:28.072
Like, she look like
she's ready to go.

33:28.139 --> 33:29.707
{\an6}Uhh!

33:28.139 --> 33:29.707
You're doing it,
you're doing it.

33:29.774 --> 33:32.543
This is good. How long
you been working out?

33:32.610 --> 33:33.878
{\an1}I've worked out
all my life.

33:33.945 --> 33:37.915
{\an1}I took it serious about
five years and a half or so.

33:37.982 --> 33:39.117
So, you've been
working out, training,

33:39.183 --> 33:40.685
{\an5}for, like,
five/six years?

33:39.183 --> 33:40.685
{\an1}Yeah.

33:40.752 --> 33:42.887
{\an5}Wow. So,
this is your gym?

33:40.752 --> 33:42.887
{\an1}Yeah.

33:42.954 --> 33:46.224
{\an5}Wow, this is lit.

33:42.954 --> 33:46.224
{\an1}I've had it
for about two years.

33:46.290 --> 33:48.226
So, what does
"MDE" stand for?

33:48.292 --> 33:50.962
{\an1}"MDE" stands for
"Music Does Entertain."

33:51.028 --> 33:52.363
My dude is into music.

33:52.430 --> 33:54.465
{\an5}Oh, so this is you
and your boo gym.

33:52.430 --> 33:54.465
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.634
{\an5}What's his name?

33:54.532 --> 33:56.634
His name is Akbar.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.470
Oh! That sounds strong.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.470
{\an1}Yeah.

33:59.537 --> 34:00.738
That's, like, a man.

34:00.805 --> 34:03.040
Yo, I'm real good,
but this was too easy.

34:03.107 --> 34:04.809
It just fell
right in my lap.

34:04.876 --> 34:07.545
Thanks, girlfriend
number two. It worked out.

34:07.612 --> 34:08.612
{\an3}Hey!

34:08.679 --> 34:09.781
Hey, how can I help you?

34:09.847 --> 34:12.083
Hey!

34:09.847 --> 34:12.083
{\an3}Hey!

34:12.150 --> 34:13.684
So I was just
starting to work out.

34:13.751 --> 34:14.752
You guys know each other?

34:14.819 --> 34:15.887
Yeah.

34:14.819 --> 34:15.887
{\an3}Yeah.

34:15.953 --> 34:17.054
{\an5}Hey, I'm Nikki.

34:15.953 --> 34:17.054
{\an1}Alejandra.

34:17.121 --> 34:18.489
You see, she got
the cute body too,

34:18.556 --> 34:20.291
but your body ain't
like hers, though.

34:20.358 --> 34:22.393
This girl Alejandra,
she cool.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.462
{\an5}And girl, guess what?

34:22.460 --> 34:24.462
What?

34:24.529 --> 34:26.731
It's true. Yeah,
that's her man.

34:26.797 --> 34:29.199
{\an8}What you talking about?

34:26.797 --> 34:29.199
{\an8}Akbar?

34:26.797 --> 34:29.199
{\an6}Yeah.

34:29.266 --> 34:31.268
{\an8}Akbar everybody's man,
clearly.

34:31.335 --> 34:34.304
{\an5}Hold on, hold on.
Why do you want to know
about him so much?

34:34.371 --> 34:35.440
Because he's dating
our friend.

34:35.505 --> 34:36.607
He's dating one
of my best friends.

34:36.674 --> 34:37.742
He's dating
our friend Teairra.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.210
{\an5}Teairra.
Teairra Mari.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.210
{\an1}Okay.

34:39.277 --> 34:41.112
{\an5}So you're fine
with that?

34:39.277 --> 34:41.112
{\an1}Yeah.

34:41.179 --> 34:42.513
And you're aware that
he's married to Sade?

34:42.580 --> 34:45.315
{\an4}I have a very clear
understanding of
what's going on.

34:45.382 --> 34:47.284
So everybody's like
a side bitch, then?

34:47.351 --> 34:50.420
{\an4}I don't know why
you want to know so
many questions about him.

34:50.487 --> 34:52.857
{\an5}Because the way
you two know Teairra,
she don't know you,

34:52.924 --> 34:55.726
so to be fair to my friend,
I'm finding out information

34:55.793 --> 34:57.261
so I can tell her
because she's hurting.

34:59.697 --> 35:01.232
{\an1}She's driving
one of our cars.

35:01.299 --> 35:02.633
He's adding to her.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.669
{\an5}Wait, she's driving
one of y'all cars?

35:02.700 --> 35:04.669
{\an1}Yeah.

35:04.735 --> 35:06.938
{\an5}Second sister wife.

35:04.735 --> 35:06.938
{\an1}It's not.

35:07.004 --> 35:09.307
{\an5}I think you're--
I think you're
manipulating.

35:09.373 --> 35:10.408
I think you want
to be part of it.

35:10.475 --> 35:11.442
I don't want to be
part of (bleep).

35:11.509 --> 35:12.777
{\an1}I don't think
you can, baby girl.

35:12.844 --> 35:15.413
He might want me now,
but I don't want him.

35:15.480 --> 35:16.848
Your soul is ugly.

35:16.914 --> 35:18.783
But he's a (bleep) liar
and has three different bitches,

35:18.850 --> 35:20.551
{\an5}so who the (bleep)
is better?

35:18.850 --> 35:20.551
You're a clown.

35:20.618 --> 35:21.619
But I get money, though.

35:21.686 --> 35:23.321
{\an1}You know what?
Get out of my gym.

35:23.387 --> 35:24.889
{\an1}I don't need you here.
Get out.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.525
{\an5}I'm not getting out.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.525
{\an1}You don't want to
make me get you out.

35:27.592 --> 35:29.927
{\an5}Oh, yeah?

35:27.592 --> 35:29.927
Wait, time out,
time out, time out.

35:29.994 --> 35:32.063
{\an5}I love Nikki and all,
but I ain't going to jail
fighting Chewbacca.

35:32.129 --> 35:35.333
{\an5}At the end of the day,
we got every receipt
we came here for.

35:35.399 --> 35:37.235
Let's take this
to Teairra.

35:37.301 --> 35:38.336
Nikki, let's just--
let's just go, Nikki.

35:38.402 --> 35:39.971
{\an5}All right, let's go.

35:38.402 --> 35:39.971
Yeah, please.

35:40.037 --> 35:41.706
No problem.
And next time, you know,

35:41.772 --> 35:43.407
if you feel like coming
to the strip club,

35:43.474 --> 35:44.909
if you want to make
a little extra money...

35:44.976 --> 35:48.479
{\an5}Bitch, I'm having
one of these.

35:44.976 --> 35:48.479
All right, please.

35:51.082 --> 35:52.116
{\an9}Hi, guys.

35:52.183 --> 35:53.451
{\an8}What's she
doing here, man?

35:53.518 --> 35:54.919
{\an8}This is my wife.
What do you mean?

35:54.986 --> 35:57.255
{\an7}(Loyd)
You said you was
getting a divorce.

36:03.628 --> 36:06.564
{\an8}♪♪

36:08.232 --> 36:11.569
{\an5}(A1)
I'm so relieved that me
and Lyrica got past our issues

36:11.636 --> 36:13.771
and we got a little one
on the way.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.239
We planned a little lunch
with the Moms

36:15.306 --> 36:17.275
and my brother
to break the good news

36:17.341 --> 36:19.410
and he even brought
his wife Patrice.

36:19.477 --> 36:22.079
{\an5}Now, I know they ain't
gonna be thrilled that
we back together.

36:22.146 --> 36:25.216
My brother and my mom
have not been shy

36:25.283 --> 36:28.019
about saying that they
think I should get a divorce.

36:28.085 --> 36:31.489
Patrice thinks that Lyrica
only call when she got an issue

36:31.556 --> 36:35.026
and Loyd thinks that Lyrica acts
like she's better than them.

36:36.327 --> 36:39.564
(Lyrica)
What a treat! Hi!

36:39.630 --> 36:41.699
{\an5}What's up with it, bro?

36:39.630 --> 36:41.699
{\an3}Hi, guys.

36:41.766 --> 36:44.602
Not much, man. What's
she doing here, man?

36:44.669 --> 36:46.938
This is my wife.
What do you mean?

36:47.004 --> 36:49.373
{\an4}(Loyd)
You said you was
getting a divorce,

36:49.440 --> 36:52.243
{\an4}so, I mean, are we
here to get some
divorce papers signed?

36:52.310 --> 36:53.311
What's going on?

36:52.310 --> 36:53.311
{\an3}(laughs)

36:53.377 --> 36:55.046
Uh-oh.
It's starting already.

36:55.112 --> 36:57.682
{\an5}(Lyrica)
A1's family has never wanted
us to really be together,

36:57.748 --> 36:59.984
so they must be loving it
when he told them

37:00.051 --> 37:01.752
that we're getting a divorce.

37:01.819 --> 37:05.056
Sorry to disappoint you,
Loyd, but we're not over,

37:05.122 --> 37:08.025
and we're about to add
a plus-one to the family.

37:08.092 --> 37:09.427
You say you gonna
do one thing

37:09.493 --> 37:10.962
{\an1}and then you do
another thing, man.

37:11.028 --> 37:12.063
Relax, bro.

37:12.129 --> 37:14.398
Me and her sat down.
We talked.

37:14.465 --> 37:15.833
I looked her in her eyes.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.269
She told me nothing happened
with her and Safaree,

37:18.336 --> 37:20.271
and I believe her.
I know when my wife lyin'

37:20.338 --> 37:22.106
just like you know
when Patrice lyin'.

37:22.173 --> 37:25.242
{\an7}Okay, so you must have
psychic power if you know
your wife all of a sudden.

37:25.309 --> 37:27.612
{\an8}Nobody's relationship
is perfect, so which
of you are right?

37:27.678 --> 37:30.781
{\an7}But Lyrica, I only talk
to you here and there.
You barely call me.

37:30.848 --> 37:32.783
{\an5}That's something that we
need to talk about too.

37:30.848 --> 37:32.783
I call you every other day.

37:32.850 --> 37:35.052
{\an1}No, you just started calling me
when y'all got into it.

37:35.119 --> 37:39.457
Y'all crazy, man.
Are you serious?

37:39.523 --> 37:41.192
{\an1}I'ma-- I'ma keep it
real with you.

37:41.258 --> 37:44.161
{\an4}Ever since you done
stepped into his life,
he done changed.

37:44.228 --> 37:45.796
How I change?

37:45.863 --> 37:48.032
{\an8}What you mean,
how you change?

37:45.863 --> 37:48.032
{\an5}Being Hollywood.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.735
{\an4}Well, if I call you,
you don't answer,
you don't answer.

37:50.801 --> 37:52.103
It take two, three days
to call back,

37:52.169 --> 37:54.305
{\an1}and I understand you be busy
and everything like that,

37:54.372 --> 37:56.507
{\an1}but I'm your brother, man.
I don't even know you.

37:56.574 --> 37:58.909
And you and him was
raised just like that.

37:58.976 --> 38:01.746
Man, this is not going
the way I thought it would.

38:01.812 --> 38:03.681
Right from the jump,
we get an attack.

38:03.748 --> 38:07.418
If my family can't even
accept Lyrica as my wife,

38:07.485 --> 38:09.553
how the hell they gonna
react to this baby?

38:09.620 --> 38:12.089
{\an5}Wait. So, are y'all
mad or happy we got
back together?

38:12.156 --> 38:14.058
{\an5}I'm confused.

38:12.156 --> 38:14.058
It don't make sense.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.193
{\an4}I got messages.
You tell me he
don't (bleep) you,

38:16.260 --> 38:18.996
{\an5}he don't come home.

38:16.260 --> 38:18.996
He wasn't coming home.

38:19.063 --> 38:20.498
Okay, but you
told me that.

38:20.564 --> 38:21.999
{\an1}You told me
all kinds of (bleep).

38:22.066 --> 38:24.101
Patrice is my sister-in-law,
and, yes,

38:24.168 --> 38:25.603
when me and A1
are having problems,

38:25.670 --> 38:28.639
I've confided in her and
told her some personal things,

38:28.706 --> 38:30.508
but last thing I thought is
she'd be writing it down,

38:30.574 --> 38:32.043
putting it in her back pocket,

38:32.109 --> 38:34.612
and saving it for later
to throw up in my face.

38:34.679 --> 38:36.914
Y'all sit here and lie.
Hi, Mom.

38:36.981 --> 38:41.352
{\an5}No, you're lying.

38:36.981 --> 38:41.352
No, you're lying,
you're lying.

38:41.419 --> 38:43.788
{\an8}My daughter invited me
to lunch with her and A1,

38:43.854 --> 38:46.023
{\an8}but I didn't know these
clowns were gonna be here.

38:46.090 --> 38:47.925
The last time
I saw the Bentleys,

38:47.992 --> 38:50.294
I got kicked out of
my own daughter's house.

38:50.361 --> 38:51.529
And by the looks of things,

38:51.595 --> 38:53.397
the disrespect
towards my daughter

38:53.464 --> 38:55.933
has only gotten worse.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.502
Well, what the (bleep)
is going on?

38:58.569 --> 38:59.737
Ask your daughter
what's going on.

38:59.804 --> 39:01.505
Ask my daughter?
What is your problem?

39:01.572 --> 39:03.007
Don't come in here and ask me
what the (bleep) is going on.

39:03.074 --> 39:05.643
{\an4}I'm grown!

39:03.074 --> 39:05.643
Sit down, girl!

39:05.710 --> 39:09.780
(overlapping shouting)

39:09.847 --> 39:12.016
She's a bitch!

39:09.847 --> 39:12.016
Bitch, what?

39:12.083 --> 39:13.217
Don't call my mama
no bitch!

39:13.284 --> 39:14.318
{\an3}Yo!

39:13.284 --> 39:14.318
{\an1}Bitch!

39:14.385 --> 39:15.920
Whoa!
What the (bleep)?

39:15.986 --> 39:17.154
(overlapping shouting)

39:17.221 --> 39:19.390
Clear, clear, clear!

39:24.695 --> 39:26.230
{\an8}(Apple)
Next time on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop: Hollywood"...

39:26.297 --> 39:28.766
{\an8}I didn't know Patrice
and Loyd were coming,

39:28.833 --> 39:32.036
{\an8}and me and A1 were
supposed to tell you guys
that I'm pregnant.

39:32.103 --> 39:35.106
{\an9}(crying)

39:35.172 --> 39:38.209
{\an7}(Ray J)
I'ma go to this dinner
and I'ma have you pop up.

39:38.275 --> 39:42.947
{\an7}Say what you gotta say.
Hey, I hit it one time.
It was nothing.

39:43.013 --> 39:45.416
{\an8}(Ray J)
Let 'em know what you
told me, fam.

39:45.483 --> 39:47.651
{\an8}So that might be your baby
'cause Lyrica pregnant?

39:47.718 --> 39:49.520
{\an7}(laughs)
Yo...

39:49.587 --> 39:52.423
{\an8}We're not gonna do this
(bleep) again!

39:52.490 --> 39:54.492
{\an8}What the (bleep)
is going on?

39:54.558 --> 40:00.931
{\an8}♪♪

40:00.998 --> 40:03.701
{\an8}(DJ)
Let's make some noise
for Amber Diamond.

40:03.768 --> 40:06.203
{\an8}You know what I'm saying?

40:03.768 --> 40:06.203
{\an8}(cheers and applause)

40:06.270 --> 40:10.107
{\an8}Hey, for a $20,000 (bleep),
that (bleep) is bull(bleep).

40:10.174 --> 40:13.344
{\an8}Hey, why don't you press
play on Amber's vocals

40:13.410 --> 40:15.146
{\an8}before I did
surgery to 'em?

40:15.212 --> 40:16.514
{\an7}(bleep)!

40:16.580 --> 40:19.850
{\an8}Akbar, I felt like
he really was married,

40:19.917 --> 40:22.987
{\an8}so what I did was,
I reached out to
the girl, Sade.

40:23.053 --> 40:24.555
{\an8}They really are
together.

40:24.622 --> 40:26.524
{\an8}Yeah. She said they've been
married for, like, six years.

40:26.590 --> 40:29.527
{\an8}It ain't even just Sade.
There's another female.

40:29.593 --> 40:31.495
{\an8}(knocking)

40:31.562 --> 40:33.898
{\an8}This is Alejandra
and this is Sade.

40:33.964 --> 40:36.700
{\an8}Is that your girlfriend
and your wife?

40:36.767 --> 40:38.068
{\an8}I invest in women.

40:38.135 --> 40:39.336
{\an7}You've been through
all these relationships,

40:39.403 --> 40:41.272
{\an7}these broken relationships,
and look at you now.

40:41.338 --> 40:43.641
{\an8}I'm first, she's second,
and if you're dealing with us,

40:43.707 --> 40:45.142
{\an8}bitch, you're gonna be last.

40:45.209 --> 40:46.243
{\an8}You're insane!

40:46.310 --> 40:49.747
{\an8}Come on! Come on!
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh!

40:49.814 --> 40:52.750
