01:12.137 --> 01:15.006
Ma'am, you must eat something.

01:25.788 --> 01:29.130
You must be terribly weak
by now.

01:30.826 --> 01:32.562
I won't do it anymore.

01:35.831 --> 01:36.731
I can't.

01:39.670 --> 01:41.274
You can.

01:41.309 --> 01:42.209
You have to.

01:43.839 --> 01:47.280
Everyone is most concerned
about your behavior.

02:42.227 --> 02:43.864
She's-- She's out!

02:43.899 --> 02:45.437
She's out!

02:45.472 --> 02:47.703
Find her!

02:47.738 --> 02:49.034
Look in the cellar!

02:51.709 --> 02:53.280
Somebody check the grounds.

02:53.315 --> 02:54.644
Go, go, go!

02:57.649 --> 02:59.748
Bar the doors.
Seal the rooms.

02:59.783 --> 03:01.255
It all ends here.

03:03.754 --> 03:06.183
With me.
Ma'am, wait!

03:06.218 --> 03:08.460
Please, no! Stop!

03:08.495 --> 03:09.824
No!

03:26.106 --> 03:27.479
<i>Thank you.</i>

03:27.514 --> 03:29.283
It's a pleasure to be here
with you all,

03:29.318 --> 03:33.386
celebrating the ten-year
anniversary of UnlockYourPast.

03:33.421 --> 03:34.816
Beef carpaccio?

03:34.851 --> 03:36.422
Mm-mm.
We hit this milestone

03:36.457 --> 03:39.458
because people yearn
for connection.

03:39.493 --> 03:41.218
For a sense of family.

03:41.253 --> 03:42.725
A sense of belonging.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.122
Beef carpaccio?

03:44.157 --> 03:46.630
And for the sense
of purpose that comes

03:46.665 --> 03:48.665
from knowing who you are.

03:48.700 --> 03:51.833
We should do it.
I want you to ask yourself:

03:51.868 --> 03:53.670
"Who am I?"
Beef carpaccio?

03:53.705 --> 03:54.968
Shh.

03:55.003 --> 03:58.070
And "What is my true purpose?"

03:59.172 --> 04:00.809
Beef fucking carpaccio.

04:07.048 --> 04:10.753
Ugh. What a creep.
You gonna call him?

04:10.788 --> 04:12.854
No, gross.

04:12.889 --> 04:15.054
If you not gonna call him,
maybe I will.

04:16.629 --> 04:17.793
Evie, don't judge.

04:17.828 --> 04:19.828
You know how hard it is
out here.

04:19.863 --> 04:22.193
Can you imagine
being that rich?

04:22.228 --> 04:24.470
Just walking around
like you own people.

04:24.505 --> 04:26.604
Girl, he probably does
own people.

04:26.639 --> 04:29.035
Wanted to add you
to the roster.

04:29.070 --> 04:31.972
So I got a boob graze
and a butt grab tonight.

04:32.007 --> 04:33.479
How about you?

04:33.514 --> 04:36.845
<i>Dos</i> to the<i> tetas.</i>
Mm. Frisky.

04:36.880 --> 04:40.145
Want me to call HR for you?
Oh, hey, Tony.

04:40.180 --> 04:43.214
We were just messing around.
Just jokes.

04:43.249 --> 04:45.051
You know there are

04:45.086 --> 04:48.725
plenty of other girls who would
be grateful for this gig.

04:54.403 --> 04:55.699
What an asshat.

04:56.768 --> 05:00.473
I did grab us a swag bag.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.706
This one's got
little bottles of wine in them.

05:02.741 --> 05:04.301
My favorite.
Mm-hm.

05:04.336 --> 05:06.710
And there's a DNA test
in there too.

05:06.745 --> 05:09.174
I gotta run.
Got my midterm tomorrow.

05:09.209 --> 05:12.243
You're gonna crush it.
I know. See you later.

Did you ever go out on a date

07:56.948 --> 07:59.883
Ugh. I'm ignoring his texts.
Why?

07:59.918 --> 08:01.555
You said you liked him.
Ah...

08:01.590 --> 08:04.822
I can't handle the New York
dating scene right now.

08:04.857 --> 08:06.351
It is exhausting.

08:11.556 --> 08:12.599
No way.

08:12.634 --> 08:13.567
What?

08:16.099 --> 08:17.395
I got a cousin.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.034
Holy shit.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.070
That is the whitest man
I've ever seen.

08:22.105 --> 08:23.104
He wants to meet up.

08:24.646 --> 08:26.580
A stranger? Off the Internet?

08:26.615 --> 08:29.583
Mm-mm. You're not doing that.

08:29.618 --> 08:31.717
He's family,
and I don't have any.

08:31.752 --> 08:34.588
So you wanna be catfished?
Oh, interesting.

08:34.623 --> 08:36.183
He's wearing an ascot.

08:36.218 --> 08:38.185
What could he want
with my broke ass?

08:38.220 --> 08:39.857
Your kidneys.

08:39.892 --> 08:42.024
That's probably
exactly what this site is.

08:42.059 --> 08:44.191
Tinder for unassuming
organ donors.

08:44.226 --> 08:45.698
Says right there
in the corner.

08:45.733 --> 08:48.899
And he's British.
They're all absurdly polite.

08:48.934 --> 08:51.704
Because they're racked
with colonial guilt.

08:51.739 --> 08:54.135
Doesn't mean you need to
mistake that for good manners.

08:54.170 --> 08:57.809
I'm sorry, whose last, wait,
three boyfriends were white?

08:57.844 --> 08:59.041
Mm-mm.

08:59.076 --> 09:00.944
We are unpacking that
in therapy.

09:00.979 --> 09:02.781
Don't do me like that.

09:02.816 --> 09:04.475
Look, all I'm saying is,

09:04.510 --> 09:06.752
leopards don't usually
change their spots.

09:16.126 --> 09:18.159
Cousin Oliver.

09:36.311 --> 09:37.981
Oliver.

09:38.016 --> 09:39.312
Evelyn.

09:39.347 --> 09:41.149
Hi. Please, have a seat.

09:41.184 --> 09:43.151
You can just call me Evie.

09:43.186 --> 09:45.186
Cousin Evie.

09:45.221 --> 09:48.618
It sounds so Jane Austen
when you say it like that.

09:49.863 --> 09:52.424
So, um, you're in town for work?

09:52.459 --> 09:54.965
Yeah, family business.
Real estate.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.803
La, la, la.
Sounds, uh, exciting.

09:57.838 --> 09:58.837
Not in the slightest.

10:01.402 --> 10:03.875
Okay, tell me
everything about yourself.

10:03.910 --> 10:05.778
Work, relationship status.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.307
I want to know it all.

10:07.342 --> 10:10.816
Well, I am trying
to get my MFA, uh,

10:10.851 --> 10:13.577
but I'm mostly just
freelancing right now.

10:15.218 --> 10:17.119
Catering, really.
Hm.

10:17.154 --> 10:19.220
And I am very much single.

10:19.255 --> 10:21.321
Oh, God, me too. Painfully so.

10:21.356 --> 10:24.060
What about your parents?
Are they in New York too?

10:24.095 --> 10:25.457
My dad...

10:25.492 --> 10:26.997
My dad died when I was 14,

10:27.032 --> 10:30.198
and my mom passed
just a few months ago, actually.

10:32.334 --> 10:33.740
I'm so sorry.

10:33.775 --> 10:35.566
Thanks, um...

10:35.601 --> 10:38.536
You know, she was sick
for a while. Cancer.

10:38.571 --> 10:41.506
But she always wanted
to take me to England,

10:41.541 --> 10:44.476
so we could learn
about our family history.

10:44.511 --> 10:45.719
So...
Yes.

10:45.754 --> 10:48.150
Well, it's quite fascinating,
actually.

10:48.185 --> 10:49.921
You're part
of the family scandal.

10:49.956 --> 10:53.155
Just before her nuptials
in 1925,

10:53.190 --> 10:55.190
your great-grandmother,
Emmaline,

10:55.225 --> 10:57.423
had an illicit affair
with a footman.

10:59.031 --> 11:00.899
A Black footman?

11:00.934 --> 11:02.560
Well, evidently, yeah.

11:02.595 --> 11:05.431
Wow. I imagine
that was quite the scandal.

11:05.466 --> 11:07.664
She kept it a secret
from everyone,

11:07.699 --> 11:09.039
including her future husband.

11:09.074 --> 11:10.942
Quite the rebel,
your great-grandmother.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.913
So, what happened
to my grandfather?

11:14.948 --> 11:16.541
The baby.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.884
Turns out the footman
left the village

11:18.919 --> 11:22.547
and raised the baby,
your grandfather, on his own.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.120
Scandals aren't
what they used to be.

11:24.155 --> 11:26.122
Everyone is utterly
overjoyed by the news.

11:26.157 --> 11:27.860
Everyone?

11:27.895 --> 11:29.763
I can't keep secrets.

11:29.798 --> 11:31.721
The whole Alexander family
knows about you.

11:31.756 --> 11:34.361
Great-Uncle Alfred,
Uncle Julius,

11:34.396 --> 11:36.726
my three brothers,
all the cousins.

11:36.761 --> 11:39.300
There's a wedding coming up.
My...

11:39.335 --> 11:43.568
<i>Our</i> cousin Martin is getting
married in a few weeks.

11:43.603 --> 11:47.473
Huge celebration in the English
countryside, really posh.

11:47.508 --> 11:49.739
That's him and his fiancée,
Cecile.

11:49.774 --> 11:51.785
She's one of the De Villes.

11:51.820 --> 11:55.382
<i>Très</i> rich. It'll be
the wedding of the century.

11:55.417 --> 11:56.922
You know what? You should come.

11:57.859 --> 11:59.122
What?

11:59.157 --> 12:01.586
To the wedding.
You should come.
Uh...

12:01.621 --> 12:05.931
I'd love to, but I cannot
afford a trip right now.

12:05.966 --> 12:07.592
Don't be silly. Our treat.

12:07.627 --> 12:09.264
I've got so many
frequent-flier miles.

12:09.299 --> 12:10.397
You'd be doing me a favor.

12:10.432 --> 12:11.937
Oliver, really, thank you,

12:11.972 --> 12:14.005
but that is too much to ask.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.073
Great-Uncle Alfred
is dying to meet you.

12:16.108 --> 12:18.108
Literally.
He's 89 and quite frail.

12:18.143 --> 12:19.769
He'd love for us all
to be together.

12:19.804 --> 12:21.815
It's a brilliant idea.

12:21.850 --> 12:22.849
I just...

12:24.149 --> 12:25.115
Are you serious?

12:27.053 --> 12:29.614
I can't imagine
what you've gone through

12:29.649 --> 12:31.154
after losing your mother.

12:31.189 --> 12:33.783
It's tragic,
but you still have family.

12:33.818 --> 12:35.521
You could fulfill
your mother's wish

12:35.556 --> 12:37.325
by taking the trip
she always wanted.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.326
Worst-case scenario,

12:38.361 --> 12:39.756
it's an all-expenses-paid trip

12:39.791 --> 12:41.835
to Whitby, Yorkshire.
You just have to tolerate

12:41.870 --> 12:43.661
my terrible sense of humor
for a few days.

12:43.696 --> 12:44.970
Come on, say yes.

12:52.309 --> 12:54.144
<i>Hey, girl.</i>
<i>How's the motherland?</i>

12:54.179 --> 12:55.772
<i>You know, it feels good.</i>

12:55.807 --> 12:57.510
<i>I'm excited to meet my family.</i>

12:57.545 --> 12:59.809
<i>Oh, I'm excited for you.</i>

12:59.844 --> 13:01.646
<i>Now, what are the three rules?</i>

13:01.681 --> 13:04.220
Uh... Eat, pray, love?

13:04.255 --> 13:06.519
<i>Girl, if you wind up</i>
<i>dead in a ditch,</i>

13:06.554 --> 13:08.554
<i>I'm telling you,</i>
<i>I'm not helping.</i>

13:08.589 --> 13:12.558
Okay, okay. Send you a picture
of the license plate.

13:12.593 --> 13:15.000
Text you when I go to sleep.
And...

13:15.035 --> 13:16.694
<i>And don't trust...</i>

13:16.729 --> 13:18.729
Don't trust men with goatees.
<i>...men with goatees.</i>

13:18.764 --> 13:20.401
No.
<i>There you go.</i>

13:20.436 --> 13:22.139
I'm at Arrivals.
I'll call you later.

13:22.174 --> 13:24.669
<i>If you see Idris Elba,</i>
<i>say hi to him for me.</i>

13:24.704 --> 13:26.407
All right, bye.
- Evie.

13:26.442 --> 13:27.540
You made it.

13:29.214 --> 13:31.181
Hi.
How was the flight?

13:31.216 --> 13:34.085
Uh...
You've ruined coach forever.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.515
My pleasure.

13:35.550 --> 13:38.023
Ready for an adventure?
I guess.

13:38.058 --> 13:39.420
Come on, let's go.

13:46.099 --> 13:49.232
- So who lives here again?
- The De Ville family.

13:49.267 --> 13:52.400
But our family will be staying
the weekend for the festivities.

13:55.306 --> 13:56.602
Holy shit.

13:59.277 --> 14:01.277
Are they royalty or something?

14:01.312 --> 14:04.412
No, it's just old money.
England's full of it.

14:06.988 --> 14:09.219
Right this way. There you are.

14:10.552 --> 14:11.650
Watch your step.

14:16.228 --> 14:17.128
There you go.

14:19.968 --> 14:21.264
All right.

14:21.299 --> 14:24.267
You definitely must be
on your best behavior.

14:34.576 --> 14:37.148
Welcome to New Carfax Abbey.

14:37.183 --> 14:38.248
Wow, it's...

14:39.251 --> 14:40.811
incredible.

14:40.846 --> 14:42.285
Let me go find our host.

14:48.623 --> 14:51.261
All right, text a photo
of the license--

14:51.296 --> 14:52.790
Oh, shit.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.968
I am so sorry.

14:55.003 --> 14:57.069
No, miss, we're sorry.

14:57.104 --> 14:58.004
Very sorry.

14:59.535 --> 15:01.469
Oh, please, miss,
we'll clean this up.

15:01.504 --> 15:04.978
It's okay. If we don't help
each other out, who will, right?

15:05.013 --> 15:06.342
I'm Evie, by the way.

15:07.873 --> 15:09.279
I'm Diya.

15:09.314 --> 15:11.347
Or Dee is fine too.

15:11.382 --> 15:12.645
I'm Imogen.

15:12.680 --> 15:14.416
And what has happened here?

15:14.451 --> 15:16.319
Oh, hi. Uh, it was me. I--

15:16.354 --> 15:18.453
Clean it up immediately. We have
important guests arriving.

15:18.488 --> 15:19.685
Yes, sir, of course.

15:20.622 --> 15:22.160
It was really my fault.

15:22.195 --> 15:25.262
I don't care whose fault it was.
Just get rid of it.

15:25.297 --> 15:27.132
There's no need
to be snarky about it.

15:27.167 --> 15:29.134
I beg your pardon?

15:29.169 --> 15:30.366
Did I stutter?

15:30.401 --> 15:32.335
At ease, Mr. Field.

15:32.370 --> 15:35.008
I believe this is
one of our important guests.

15:36.176 --> 15:37.868
And that makes a difference?

15:37.903 --> 15:40.079
My sincerest apologies,
ma'am.

15:41.742 --> 15:43.511
Sir.

15:43.546 --> 15:44.578
Thank you, ladies.

15:46.648 --> 15:48.813
Sorry about that.
He can be quite demanding.

15:48.848 --> 15:50.683
More like an asshole.

15:50.718 --> 15:52.388
Oh, so you must be Evelyn.

15:52.423 --> 15:54.687
Evie. And you are?
- Walter.

15:56.889 --> 15:59.395
You beat me to the punch.
You've been introduced?

15:59.430 --> 16:00.858
Yeah.
Uh, no.

16:00.893 --> 16:02.860
Well, not formally.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.236
This is my cousin who I was
telling you about,

16:05.271 --> 16:06.732
Evie Alexander.

16:06.767 --> 16:08.404
It's Jackson, really.

16:08.439 --> 16:11.539
Evie, this is the lord
of the manor, Walter De Ville.

16:13.345 --> 16:15.048
You can just call me Walt.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.379
Oh, uh...

16:16.414 --> 16:18.249
Hi, Walt. Um--

16:18.284 --> 16:19.844
Hi.
Yeah, so...

16:19.879 --> 16:23.848
I was the one who ran into them
and the glasses.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.191
So, yeah, it really
wasn't their fault.

16:26.226 --> 16:29.227
Okay, so you're the klutz.
Got it.

16:30.626 --> 16:32.593
Is this a gift
for the happy couple?

16:32.628 --> 16:34.067
Uh, yeah.

16:34.102 --> 16:35.530
May I?
Oh, yeah.

16:35.565 --> 16:37.235
I made it.

16:39.701 --> 16:40.733
Wow.

16:41.868 --> 16:44.000
It's very impressive.

16:44.035 --> 16:45.375
Sir?
Hm?

16:45.410 --> 16:46.871
The grounds are ready
for inspection.

16:46.906 --> 16:49.742
Ah. Well, excuse me.

16:49.777 --> 16:52.481
I hope you enjoy
your time at New Carfax, Evie.

16:55.486 --> 16:58.124
Oh, and thank you
for letting me stay.

16:58.159 --> 16:59.092
Your, uh...

17:00.788 --> 17:03.261
m-mansion, it's beautiful.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.165
My home is your home.

17:09.995 --> 17:12.138
Well, that was only
mildly awkward.

17:12.173 --> 17:13.964
I'm sure he got a kick
out of it.

17:13.999 --> 17:18.474
Sir, may I escort the lady
to her bedroom?

17:18.509 --> 17:22.280
Evie, this is Mr. Field,
head butler here at New Carfax.

17:22.315 --> 17:23.842
Yeah, we met.

17:28.849 --> 17:29.782
I got it.

17:32.655 --> 17:34.556
Have fun.

17:34.591 --> 17:37.757
You're most welcome to venture
anywhere within the estate.

17:37.792 --> 17:39.990
Except the library.
We're renovating.

17:42.962 --> 17:46.095
Are these all real?

17:46.130 --> 17:50.308
I can assure you
everything is authentic, ma'am.

17:50.343 --> 17:52.475
The master is a great supporter
of the arts.

18:03.147 --> 18:06.192
Allow me to introduce you
to your lady's maid,

18:06.227 --> 18:07.325
Mrs. Swift.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.525
I get a maid?

18:09.560 --> 18:11.890
Of course.
Hi, I'm Evie.

18:15.302 --> 18:16.631
Welcome, miss.

18:16.666 --> 18:17.962
Right this way.

18:33.353 --> 18:34.814
This is my room?

18:34.849 --> 18:36.948
Is it to your liking, miss?

18:36.983 --> 18:38.114
Uh...

18:38.149 --> 18:39.555
Yeah.

18:42.890 --> 18:44.824
Oh, wow.

18:44.859 --> 18:48.124
That is something.

18:48.159 --> 18:51.160
A gift from the maids of honor.

18:51.195 --> 18:54.603
There's more than one?
Yes, it's a De Ville tradition.

18:55.936 --> 18:57.507
The mirror broke last week,

18:57.542 --> 18:59.641
but we've ordered a new one.

18:59.676 --> 19:01.214
Isn't that seven years
bad luck?

19:08.553 --> 19:10.014
What's with the bars?

19:10.049 --> 19:13.050
The shrikes are quite
aggressive this time of year.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.183
Shrikes?

19:14.218 --> 19:16.427
Local carnivorous birds, miss.

19:16.462 --> 19:19.056
They exhibit
a peculiar strain of brutality.

19:19.091 --> 19:22.928
They impale their prey
on thorns.

19:22.963 --> 19:25.700
Legend has it one
plucked out a stable boy's eye

19:25.735 --> 19:27.702
and stuck it on a fence spike.

19:27.737 --> 19:29.836
Gave the maids quite a fright.

19:29.871 --> 19:30.771
Holy shit.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.913
Miss?
Yeah?

19:40.948 --> 19:43.256
This is the service bell.

19:43.291 --> 19:45.918
Just pull it
if you need assistance.

19:47.152 --> 19:48.459
Yes, like that.

19:49.825 --> 19:51.088
Please, don't.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.298
Sorry.

19:59.340 --> 20:00.273
Who's that?

20:01.804 --> 20:04.310
A former lady of the house.

20:04.345 --> 20:06.279
Well, she looks thrilled
to be here.

20:07.612 --> 20:09.414
She was a woman
of great depth.

20:10.582 --> 20:12.615
She passed away recently.

20:14.146 --> 20:15.750
Oh.

20:15.785 --> 20:18.291
I'm so sorry.

20:19.921 --> 20:22.086
I know the pain
of losing someone

20:22.121 --> 20:24.495
never really quite leaves you.

20:27.533 --> 20:29.929
Is there anything else
you'll be needing, miss?

20:29.964 --> 20:31.260
No.

20:31.295 --> 20:34.967
I promise, I'll be
your easiest customer yet.

20:36.135 --> 20:37.035
Thank you, miss.

20:56.859 --> 20:58.760
GRACE
<i>Is that a four-poster bed?</i>

20:58.795 --> 21:00.960
G, this place is insane.

21:00.995 --> 21:03.468
They got drawing rooms
and service bells.

21:03.503 --> 21:05.195
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Well, don't get lured in.</i>

21:05.230 --> 21:07.604
<i>Next thing you know, you'll be</i>
<i>posing for nude portraits.</i>

21:07.639 --> 21:10.343
Oh. And I made a total ass
of myself

21:10.378 --> 21:12.169
with the "lord of the manor."

21:12.204 --> 21:14.270
<i>Did you overdo it</i>
<i>on the bubbly again?</i>

21:14.305 --> 21:16.679
Maybe. But in my defense,

21:16.714 --> 21:18.879
his butler was being
an entitled douchebag,

21:18.914 --> 21:22.784
and then the lord swooped in
and saved the day.

21:22.819 --> 21:24.885
Did I mention he's hot?

21:24.920 --> 21:26.788
<i>Wait. The butler or the lord?</i>

21:26.823 --> 21:28.185
The lord, Walt.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.396
And you'd think he'd be
like 100 years old,

21:30.431 --> 21:32.321
but he's our age.

21:32.356 --> 21:33.465
<i>Hold up.</i>

21:34.732 --> 21:35.665
Hang on a sec.

21:42.234 --> 21:43.376
Oh.

21:43.411 --> 21:45.235
Hi.
Hi, Walt.

21:45.270 --> 21:46.808
Sorry to bother you so late.

21:46.843 --> 21:48.579
I saw the light on
under your door.

21:48.614 --> 21:50.141
What's up?

21:50.176 --> 21:52.308
I just wanted
to apologize again.

21:52.343 --> 21:55.751
Our butler,
he's a bit old-fashioned.

21:55.786 --> 21:57.181
I hope you weren't offended.

21:57.216 --> 21:58.853
Um...

21:58.888 --> 21:59.953
I was, actually.

22:01.121 --> 22:02.428
Oh. Um...

22:02.463 --> 22:03.858
I am sorry.

22:03.893 --> 22:07.829
I'm sorry. I'll...
I'll talk to him.

22:07.864 --> 22:11.767
Is there any chance we can
erase the memory and start over?

22:11.802 --> 22:13.538
I don't know
if that's possible,

22:13.573 --> 22:17.872
but you could maybe make
a better second impression.

22:18.908 --> 22:19.940
Right, okay.

22:19.975 --> 22:23.515
And how am I doing with that?

22:23.550 --> 22:26.078
Solid seven and a half.

22:28.885 --> 22:30.522
Maybe-maybe an eight.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.986
Okay, well,
that's a start at least.

22:35.727 --> 22:38.860
I trust your accommodation
meets your high standards?

22:38.895 --> 22:41.126
I mean, I can live with this.

22:41.161 --> 22:42.127
Yeah?
Yeah.

22:42.162 --> 22:43.700
Are you sure?
Yeah.

22:43.735 --> 22:45.262
Thank you for tolerating it.

22:46.397 --> 22:48.133
Thank you for apologizing.

22:50.577 --> 22:52.478
I am gonna let you
get some rest.

22:54.405 --> 22:58.044
I'm glad that you decided
to make the trip over.

22:58.079 --> 23:00.585
I'm looking forward
to getting to know you better.

23:01.489 --> 23:02.422
Me too.

23:03.623 --> 23:05.051
Good night, Evie.

23:05.086 --> 23:06.525
Night, Walt.

23:07.957 --> 23:09.385
- <i> Mmm!</i>
Shh.

23:09.420 --> 23:10.958
<i>I do believe our Miss Evelyn</i>

23:10.993 --> 23:12.795
<i>is gonna get some</i>
<i>destination-wedding D.</i>

23:12.830 --> 23:15.666
Stop, all right?
He is just being a good host.

23:15.701 --> 23:17.668
<i>Are you seriously gonna deny</i>
<i>that accent?</i>

23:17.703 --> 23:19.395
What happened to
"don't trust anyone"?

23:19.430 --> 23:21.639
<i>Anyone with goatees.</i>
<i>He's a lord.</i>

23:21.674 --> 23:23.168
<i>And you and I both know</i>

23:23.203 --> 23:24.334
<i>it's been a minute</i>
<i>since you had some.</i>

23:24.369 --> 23:26.237
Okay, I'm gonna go for a jog.

23:26.272 --> 23:27.711
<i>You better snog him.</i>

24:12.989 --> 24:13.889
<i>...ends here.</i>

24:16.421 --> 24:17.992
<i>It all ends here.</i>

24:21.668 --> 24:22.568
<i>With me.</i>

24:38.410 --> 24:39.552
VOICE
<i>Evie.</i>

25:13.786 --> 25:16.413
We must wait here
for your assignment, ladies.

25:18.318 --> 25:19.757
Should be any moment now.

25:55.696 --> 25:58.895
Jesus, you scared me.

25:58.930 --> 26:00.633
Miss, you should return
to your room.

26:00.668 --> 26:02.261
It's not safe in the dark.

26:02.296 --> 26:03.999
I just wanted some water.

26:09.633 --> 26:10.533
Two.

26:11.536 --> 26:12.876
You're to clean the library.

26:14.209 --> 26:16.011
The rest of you
return to your quarters.

26:16.046 --> 26:17.012
Yes, sir.

26:20.688 --> 26:22.314
What are they doing down there?

26:22.349 --> 26:24.382
Final cleaning rounds, miss.

26:26.452 --> 26:28.793
Please, go back to bed.

26:28.828 --> 26:31.796
I'll make you a chamomile tea
to help with the jet lag.

26:36.330 --> 26:37.362

Excuse me, miss.

29:12.651 --> 29:15.025
I believe your family reunion
is starting.

29:15.060 --> 29:16.587
Oh, shit.

29:28.634 --> 29:30.205
There she is.

29:30.240 --> 29:33.043
Hi. I'm so sorry. I overslept.

29:33.078 --> 29:35.045
"Party late, sleep late,"
I say.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.772
I'm your Uncle Julius.

29:36.807 --> 29:40.050
And, you know, we're all
so delighted that you're here.

29:40.085 --> 29:41.381
I'm delighted too.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.353
A toast.

29:46.388 --> 29:48.861
Great-Uncle Alfred, patriarch.

29:50.722 --> 29:54.163
Just wanted to take this moment

29:54.198 --> 29:58.904
to welcome Evelyn
to the family.

29:58.939 --> 30:04.041
I was overjoyed when Oliver
told me of your existence.

30:04.076 --> 30:06.208
What a gift!

30:06.243 --> 30:09.046
We are so blessed.

30:09.081 --> 30:11.279
It truly means more to me...

30:12.414 --> 30:13.545
to us...

30:14.955 --> 30:16.988
than you can ever know.

30:17.023 --> 30:20.552
So many boys...

30:21.753 --> 30:23.423
...we thought we were done for.

30:31.136 --> 30:32.564
Oh, uh--

30:32.599 --> 30:34.203
My turn? Um...

30:35.470 --> 30:37.338
Um...

30:37.373 --> 30:40.539
All right, first I'd like
to thank Oliver.

30:40.574 --> 30:42.376
You sure know
how to spoil a girl.

30:44.083 --> 30:46.446
And I'd like to thank
all of you...

30:47.955 --> 30:49.889
for welcoming me
with open arms.

30:51.882 --> 30:56.852
It was always just my mom,
my dad and me.

30:56.887 --> 30:57.787
Now, um...

30:59.626 --> 31:02.396
to learn I have
this whole new family...

31:04.334 --> 31:05.267
Well, it's, um...

31:06.974 --> 31:08.864
It's like a dream, so...

31:08.899 --> 31:10.899
To Evie.
To Evie.

31:10.934 --> 31:12.571
To Evie.

31:15.279 --> 31:17.048
Oh, thanks.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.181
It's Dee, right?

31:20.812 --> 31:23.252
A certain Mr. De Ville

31:23.287 --> 31:25.815
was inquiring
about your whereabouts.

31:25.850 --> 31:27.256
Really?

31:27.291 --> 31:29.456
He seems to be quite charmed
by you.
Mm.

31:29.491 --> 31:32.624
I mean, can you blame him?
Absolutely not.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.628
So, Walt, um...

31:36.663 --> 31:38.729
Mr. De Ville. Uh--

31:38.764 --> 31:42.700
We're not related, right?

31:44.044 --> 31:46.143
Not in the slightest.

31:46.178 --> 31:48.981
Yeah, okay.
I was, you know, just...

31:49.016 --> 31:50.444
making sure.

32:04.823 --> 32:06.427
You.

32:06.462 --> 32:07.395
Follow me.

32:18.540 --> 32:24.115
The master of the house has
requested the 1897 Vino Cruor.

32:24.150 --> 32:26.018
You need both of us
to go get it?

32:27.714 --> 32:29.912
You have a propensity
to break things.

32:45.699 --> 32:47.732
What's his problem?

32:47.767 --> 32:49.668
Let's just find it
and get out of here.

32:50.770 --> 32:52.539
Okay.

33:20.107 --> 33:21.040
Shit.

33:27.807 --> 33:29.609
Here.
Thanks.

33:51.633 --> 33:53.237
Your face.

33:53.272 --> 33:54.634
Stop messing about.

34:06.813 --> 34:07.746
I said, quit...

34:15.426 --> 34:16.326
Over here!

34:37.217 --> 34:38.711
It's stuck at the back.

34:41.144 --> 34:42.044
Hey.

34:43.520 --> 34:44.882
Dee, what's wrong?

34:46.886 --> 34:48.457
Dee.

34:48.492 --> 34:49.392
Behind you.

35:00.405 --> 35:01.338
Dee.

35:49.751 --> 35:51.817
<i>So how's the fam?</i>

35:51.852 --> 35:53.225
Very white.

35:53.260 --> 35:54.523
<i>Oh, so you fit right in?</i>

35:54.558 --> 35:56.085
Ha, ha.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.395
Actually,
they were really sweet.

35:58.430 --> 36:01.563
Great-Uncle Alfred
even shed a tear.

36:01.598 --> 36:03.598
<i>That is so cute.</i>

36:03.633 --> 36:05.600
<i>I love when old men cry.</i>

36:05.635 --> 36:08.504
<i>Did you flirt with the lord</i>
<i>of the manor today?</i>

36:08.539 --> 36:12.475
Not yet. But he gave me
this dress to wear tonight.

36:15.414 --> 36:18.943
<i>Wow! Evie,</i>
<i>that's quite the gesture.</i>

36:18.978 --> 36:21.352
I know. I wonder what he expects
in return.

36:21.387 --> 36:22.881
<i>You know what they say.</i>

36:22.916 --> 36:24.751
<i>"When a man</i>
<i>buys you a dress..."</i>

36:24.786 --> 36:26.181
What do they say?

36:26.216 --> 36:29.327
<i>Oh! What happened?</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

36:31.628 --> 36:33.298
<i>Evie? Hello?</i>

36:33.333 --> 36:34.992
Yeah, I-I'm fine. Uh...

36:36.336 --> 36:37.764
It was just a shrike.

36:37.799 --> 36:39.964
<i>What the fuck is a shrike?</i>

36:39.999 --> 36:40.965
<i>Evie.</i>

37:06.256 --> 37:07.299
Announcing...

37:08.467 --> 37:11.567
Miss Evelyn Alexander.

37:22.547 --> 37:25.009
I was not expecting that.

37:25.044 --> 37:26.813
You look divine.

37:26.848 --> 37:29.618
Own it. You're an Alexander now,
remember?

37:29.653 --> 37:31.917
That seems to be official, huh?

37:31.952 --> 37:34.392
Would you like some champagne?
Thank you.

37:36.286 --> 37:37.494
Beef carpaccio, miss?

37:37.529 --> 37:40.497
Oh, God, no.
Thank you though.

37:40.532 --> 37:43.335
- That dress is gorgeous.
- Thank you. It was a gift.

37:44.371 --> 37:45.733
Announcing...
Cheers.

37:46.901 --> 37:48.802
...the maids of honor:

37:48.837 --> 37:51.607
Viktoria Klopstock

37:51.642 --> 37:53.972
and Lucy Billington.

38:00.013 --> 38:01.980
Wow. They're popular.

38:04.050 --> 38:05.489
We finally meet.

38:05.524 --> 38:07.018
You must be Evie.

38:07.053 --> 38:08.085
Yeah, hi.

38:09.154 --> 38:10.054
You're American.

38:11.596 --> 38:13.431
I was expecting something else.

38:14.533 --> 38:16.797
Well, this is what you get.

38:16.832 --> 38:18.502
What were your names again?

38:18.537 --> 38:20.064
I'm Lucy, and this is...

38:20.099 --> 38:21.197
Viktoria.

38:22.574 --> 38:24.904
We just wanted to extend
a warm welcome.

38:24.939 --> 38:27.137
So thrilled
to have you join us.

38:27.172 --> 38:28.578
Stop trying so hard.

38:30.747 --> 38:31.977
Thank you, Lucy.

38:32.012 --> 38:34.914
I'm equally thrilled
to be here.

38:34.949 --> 38:35.915
You're very pretty.

38:39.624 --> 38:41.250
Thank you.

38:41.285 --> 38:42.889
So are you.

38:42.924 --> 38:45.320
Oliver has told us
so much about you.

38:45.355 --> 38:47.894
Don't believe a word.
He has a penchant for flattery.

38:49.128 --> 38:50.468
So how do you know Cecile?

38:52.604 --> 38:53.669
The bride.

38:53.704 --> 38:55.407
Oh. Heh. Uh--

38:55.442 --> 38:58.366
Cece, we have known her
for years.

38:58.401 --> 39:01.446
All of our families have served
the De Villes for generations.

39:01.481 --> 39:04.042
My family, the Billingtons,
handle their legal affairs.

39:04.077 --> 39:06.451
The Klopstocks
manage their finances.

39:06.486 --> 39:08.552
And as I'm sure you know,

39:08.587 --> 39:11.885
the Alexanders find them
these incredible homes.

39:11.920 --> 39:15.757
Your life in New York,
it sounds terribly humdrum.

39:15.792 --> 39:18.760
How fortunate that your cousin
plucked you out of thin air

39:18.795 --> 39:20.762
and brought you here to us.

39:26.737 --> 39:28.363
I'm gonna get a refill.

39:28.398 --> 39:30.167
It was nice to meet you, Lucy.

39:42.280 --> 39:43.422
Champagne, please.

39:46.955 --> 39:48.691
I've always wanted
to visit New York.

39:50.024 --> 39:52.420
I'll take the<i> rouge privé.</i>

39:52.455 --> 39:54.158
It's only a hop over the pond.

39:55.535 --> 39:58.965
Yes, I don't travel much,
I'm afraid.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.507
Well, you should.
I'll show you around.

40:02.542 --> 40:04.740
You would?
Of course.

40:04.775 --> 40:07.402
I'll take you
to the secret spots.

40:07.437 --> 40:09.404
I-I would love that.

40:09.439 --> 40:12.110
That would be unbelievable.

40:12.145 --> 40:14.750
Thank you, in advance.

40:14.785 --> 40:17.181
You're welcome, in advance.

40:18.690 --> 40:22.318
The Lord of New Carfax Abbey,

40:22.353 --> 40:24.661
Walter De Ville.

40:46.212 --> 40:47.552
Wait. What are you doing?

40:47.587 --> 40:49.851
It's customary
that I have the first dance.

40:49.886 --> 40:51.446
I don't know any dances.

40:51.481 --> 40:53.624
It's fine.
Just follow my lead.

40:53.659 --> 40:54.592
Oh, my God.

40:57.696 --> 40:58.926
Get out of your head.

41:01.667 --> 41:03.194
Ready?

41:03.229 --> 41:06.329
No.
Two, three, one, two, three...

41:07.365 --> 41:09.233
Oh, no. Ahem.

41:11.743 --> 41:13.006
Are you enjoying yourself?

41:14.537 --> 41:16.372
I am.

41:16.407 --> 41:20.046
But I can't shake the feeling
that everyone is staring at me.

41:21.511 --> 41:22.752
Can you blame them?

41:34.392 --> 41:36.194
Don't gloat.

41:36.229 --> 41:38.933
You must admit, she has
a certain<i> je ne sais quoi.</i>

41:38.968 --> 41:42.431
Yes, her accent gets
right into the inner ear canal.

41:42.466 --> 41:45.104
You even make jealousy
look radiant, Viktoria.

41:47.405 --> 41:49.647
I suppose congratulations
are in order.

41:50.980 --> 41:52.408
A female Alexander.

41:54.280 --> 41:57.116
And here I thought
you were all dried up.

42:02.420 --> 42:04.596
Do you want to get out of here?

42:04.631 --> 42:06.928
Don't you have to host
your party?

42:08.261 --> 42:09.161
Yeah.

42:10.329 --> 42:11.933
There's too many sycophants.

42:13.002 --> 42:14.573
I prefer real conversation.

42:27.313 --> 42:29.445
Got it.
There you are.

42:29.480 --> 42:30.413
Thank you.

42:31.757 --> 42:34.285
So do you ever get bored here?

42:34.320 --> 42:36.122
Yeah, more often
than you'd think.

42:36.157 --> 42:40.555
Ugh. I just don't see
how that's physically possible.

42:40.590 --> 42:44.064
Well, even a life of indulgence
has its drawbacks.

42:44.099 --> 42:45.428
Are there wolves in England?

42:46.530 --> 42:48.299
Americans. Wolves?

42:48.334 --> 42:51.467
We've not had wolves
in over 400 years.

42:53.273 --> 42:57.407
Knowledge or nudity? Mm.
What's it gonna be, Eve?

42:57.442 --> 43:01.312
This is 17th century?

43:01.347 --> 43:03.820
Well done. 1632.

43:03.855 --> 43:05.481
It's beautiful.
Hm.

43:07.793 --> 43:09.760
And what's that building?

43:09.795 --> 43:11.795
The icehouse.
From a bygone era.

43:13.128 --> 43:14.490
Before refrigeration.

43:14.525 --> 43:16.833
But I have something better
to show you.

43:31.817 --> 43:32.981
Is this yours?

43:33.016 --> 43:34.510
Mm-hm.

43:34.545 --> 43:38.118
But sadly,
not all of us have talent.

43:38.153 --> 43:39.955
Want to give it a spin?

43:39.990 --> 43:41.220
In this dress?

43:41.255 --> 43:43.728
It's fine.
I'll just buy you a new one.

43:45.358 --> 43:47.732
Sorry, I know how that sounded.

43:47.767 --> 43:49.657
It's okay, I get it.

43:49.692 --> 43:51.626
You're Rockefeller rich
or whatever.

43:51.661 --> 43:53.364
It's fine.

43:53.399 --> 43:55.564
So, what drew you to pottery?

43:55.599 --> 43:57.335
Ceramics.

43:57.370 --> 43:58.677
Apologies. Ceramics.

44:00.043 --> 44:03.209
My mom.
It was one of her hobbies.

44:03.244 --> 44:08.049
When I was a kid, she taught me
how to make bowls and mugs,

44:08.084 --> 44:10.282
goofy clay sculptures.

44:12.352 --> 44:15.551
It must have moved her to know
you grew up to be an artist.

44:15.586 --> 44:18.092
I'd use the term
"artist" loosely.

44:18.127 --> 44:21.062
But, yeah, I think it did.

44:23.099 --> 44:24.296
Now that she's gone,

44:25.695 --> 44:27.101
it keeps me close to her.

44:31.701 --> 44:32.810
What about your parents?

44:34.242 --> 44:36.715
Uh, they are--
They're no longer with us.

44:38.741 --> 44:40.081
It was a...

44:40.116 --> 44:41.478
It was a long, long time ago.

44:42.789 --> 44:43.722
Look at us.

44:44.747 --> 44:46.956
Couple of orphans.

44:46.991 --> 44:49.585
Dickens would have a field day.

44:49.620 --> 44:51.895
I'm not the type
that he writes about.

44:51.930 --> 44:53.358
Oh, why's that?

44:53.393 --> 44:55.591
I have zero
redeeming qualities.

44:56.759 --> 44:58.099
Stop playing a type.

44:59.399 --> 45:01.872
What type? What type is that?

45:01.907 --> 45:04.402
A mysterious, self-deprecating,

45:04.437 --> 45:07.944
"Oh, I can't help it,
I have so much money" bad guy.

45:09.343 --> 45:11.816
It's a front. I can tell.

45:11.851 --> 45:13.983
Yeah? How can you tell?

45:14.018 --> 45:19.285
Well, for one, you didn't blow
your whole inheritance on blow.

45:19.320 --> 45:21.925
Quite the achievement.
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

45:21.960 --> 45:26.160
And you went out of your way
to apologize to me.

45:27.757 --> 45:28.690
That's redeeming.

45:30.661 --> 45:33.530
I did that 'cause I'm trying
to impress you.

45:36.700 --> 45:41.912
Anyway, are you showing me all
this just to torture me, or...?

45:41.947 --> 45:45.344
Ah, yes. No, what do you mean?

45:45.379 --> 45:47.511
I just--
I can't imagine what it's like

45:47.546 --> 45:49.315
to wake up and have all this

45:49.350 --> 45:52.153
at your fingertips
every single day.

45:52.188 --> 45:54.617
Well, maybe you should
imagine it.

45:56.654 --> 46:00.128
When are you going to stop
saying things like that?

46:00.163 --> 46:01.690
When are you going to kiss me?

46:03.496 --> 46:05.331
What makes you think
I wanna kiss you?

46:11.405 --> 46:13.845
Well, now it's cliché.

46:13.880 --> 46:16.111
Mm.

46:16.146 --> 46:18.047
Would you like me
to turn them off?

46:53.777 --> 46:55.513
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

46:55.548 --> 46:56.448
Thank you.

47:00.960 --> 47:03.686
Did your girl
turn into a pumpkin?

47:03.721 --> 47:05.820
She's recovering from jet lag.

47:05.855 --> 47:07.932
Looked like you were
enjoying yourself.

47:09.397 --> 47:10.869
She's quite refreshing.

47:12.730 --> 47:13.971
All sparkly and new?

47:15.073 --> 47:16.105
Play nice.

47:16.140 --> 47:17.909
Always.

47:21.409 --> 47:22.408
I mean it.

48:21.040 --> 48:22.435
<i>Evie.</i>

49:11.057 --> 49:13.321
Hey, it's me. It's me, okay?

49:13.356 --> 49:14.949
There's something in here.

49:14.984 --> 49:15.884
What?
There.

49:22.926 --> 49:23.859
Where?

49:28.404 --> 49:30.668
There's nothing here.

49:30.703 --> 49:31.603
No, but...

49:32.771 --> 49:34.045
Hey.

49:34.080 --> 49:36.674
Hey, hey, hey.

49:36.709 --> 49:37.609
It's okay.

49:38.909 --> 49:40.051
It's fine, you're safe.

49:40.086 --> 49:42.449
Look at me. Hey, you're safe.

49:43.584 --> 49:45.089
Yeah.
Come here.

50:00.139 --> 50:03.206
You don't have to do that.
I made the mess.

50:03.241 --> 50:04.504
It's my job, miss.

50:04.539 --> 50:06.275
Can't have your room
in this state.

50:09.148 --> 50:10.873
Oh, damn it. Sorry.

50:10.908 --> 50:11.973
Never mind that.

50:14.450 --> 50:15.878
I feel like I'm going crazy.

50:17.948 --> 50:20.014
Thank you, Mrs. Swift.

50:20.049 --> 50:21.917
Thank you.
I'll see it from here.

50:23.492 --> 50:24.425
Yes, sir.

50:27.826 --> 50:28.957
How are you feeling?

50:30.433 --> 50:32.862
Like a fool.
Don't.

50:32.897 --> 50:35.931
Okay? It's a new environment.
It takes time to adjust.

50:40.938 --> 50:43.675
If you like, I could stay
with you till you fall asleep.

50:46.108 --> 50:50.121
I... Yeah, that would be nice.

50:50.156 --> 50:51.584
Thank you.
Yeah.

50:53.621 --> 50:55.016
Do you have a preference?

50:56.195 --> 50:57.656
For what?

50:57.691 --> 51:00.461
Side of the bed.
I've kind of been sprawling.

51:00.496 --> 51:02.298
Oh.
Just everywhere.

51:02.333 --> 51:03.794
Yeah, no.

51:03.829 --> 51:05.697
I mean, whatever works.

51:07.173 --> 51:08.106
Okay. Um...

51:09.604 --> 51:10.504
Let's...
Okay.

51:22.320 --> 51:23.220
Talk to me.

51:24.289 --> 51:25.717
It'll help me fall asleep.

51:29.393 --> 51:32.020
There is actually something
I am curious about.

51:34.123 --> 51:37.498
But I don't quite know
how to ask it.

51:37.533 --> 51:38.862
Oh?

51:38.897 --> 51:41.667
Yeah, it's a little forward.

51:41.702 --> 51:45.440
Well, you are lying in my bed,
so...

51:47.213 --> 51:50.478
I'm wondering, what is it
that you want with your life?

51:50.513 --> 51:52.007
Oh, wow.

51:52.042 --> 51:54.548
We're going there.
Oh, yeah.

51:54.583 --> 51:56.781
I never mastered small talk.

51:56.816 --> 51:57.749
I've noticed.

51:59.423 --> 52:03.194
Okay, so I'm tempted to say
I wanna be a working artist.

52:03.229 --> 52:05.790
Say something important.
And all that.

52:05.825 --> 52:09.728
But truthfully,
I've been treading water.

52:10.764 --> 52:12.434
Barely scraping by.

52:14.405 --> 52:15.998
I wanna live life fully.

52:17.243 --> 52:19.342
You know?
Throw caution to the wind.

52:20.708 --> 52:22.180
That's what I really want.

52:23.447 --> 52:25.216
Great answer.

52:25.251 --> 52:26.283
And what about you?

52:27.385 --> 52:29.715
What do you want for your life?

52:29.750 --> 52:31.387
I think about this quite a lot.

52:31.422 --> 52:32.652
I can tell.

52:32.687 --> 52:34.918
I have a great life,
and I know that.

52:34.953 --> 52:36.194
But you know what?

52:38.022 --> 52:41.760
Having all the money
in the world, it means nothing.

52:41.795 --> 52:44.697
You know that's something
only rich people say, right?

52:44.732 --> 52:45.731
I know.

52:47.229 --> 52:48.734
I just...

52:51.376 --> 52:55.279
I just want to share all this.
Someone to enjoy it with.

52:55.314 --> 52:57.380
I'm tired of the facade

52:57.415 --> 53:00.174
and constantly keeping up
appearances.

53:00.209 --> 53:03.254
Yes, it's a grand life, but...

53:04.785 --> 53:05.949
it's isolating.

53:10.120 --> 53:12.890
I want someone to see me
for who I truly am.

53:15.125 --> 53:18.434
Doesn't try and change me
into an idea or into a concept.

53:20.570 --> 53:22.801
Or an itch
that they need to scratch.

53:26.268 --> 53:27.674
Someone that accepts me.

54:03.173 --> 54:04.480
Hello, sleepy head.

54:05.978 --> 54:07.318
What time is it?

54:07.353 --> 54:10.618
It is time for our spa day.

54:10.653 --> 54:12.246
We've arranged a day
of pampering

54:12.281 --> 54:13.819
for ladies
of the bridal party.

54:13.854 --> 54:15.821
We heard you had quite
the evening.

54:15.856 --> 54:19.253
Oh, yes.
Don't worry about that.

54:19.288 --> 54:20.628
Took me a while to get used

54:20.663 --> 54:22.762
to this rickety,
old place myself.

54:22.797 --> 54:24.258
You can leave that thing here.

54:24.293 --> 54:26.502
There's no service
where we're going.

54:30.167 --> 54:31.067
Come on.

54:35.909 --> 54:37.381
All right.

54:37.416 --> 54:38.745
Spa day.

54:54.323 --> 54:56.059
This is Evie.

55:06.874 --> 55:08.104
Sit, relax.

55:09.338 --> 55:10.271
Hello.

55:14.750 --> 55:17.982
So I'm excited to finally meet
the bride and groom tonight.

55:18.017 --> 55:21.249
Oh, yes, they really are
the perfect match.

55:22.923 --> 55:24.824
Would you like
to get married one day?

55:24.859 --> 55:27.222
Oh, God.
I don't know.

55:27.257 --> 55:29.697
Uh, I feel so young.

55:31.734 --> 55:33.767
But what if you met
the right person?

55:33.802 --> 55:35.901
Age is but a number.

55:35.936 --> 55:39.234
Mm, maybe one day.
But I like my independence.

55:40.105 --> 55:41.038
I see.

55:43.042 --> 55:45.108
Do you have any siblings?

55:45.143 --> 55:47.748
No, one was enough
for my parents.

55:47.783 --> 55:49.112
And they probably would've

55:49.147 --> 55:51.455
requested a refund
if they could.

55:51.490 --> 55:53.424
No, I very much doubt that.

55:54.988 --> 55:57.054
It was a joke.

55:57.089 --> 55:58.429
Oh.

55:58.464 --> 56:00.222
Right, of course.

56:00.257 --> 56:02.961
Well, I have older brothers,
but, um...

56:04.800 --> 56:06.261
always wanted a sister.

56:07.737 --> 56:09.737
Do leave the poor girl alone,
Lucy.

56:09.772 --> 56:11.640
You're like a little
Pomeranian.

56:11.675 --> 56:12.608
Yap, yap.

56:14.942 --> 56:16.744
I always wanted a sister too.

56:20.145 --> 56:22.783
You and Walter seem
to be getting close, Evie.

56:24.248 --> 56:26.886
We're just getting to know
one another.

56:26.921 --> 56:29.152
You don't have to play coy
with me, honey.

56:29.187 --> 56:30.428
I am curious though.

56:31.860 --> 56:33.794
What has he told you about us?

56:35.600 --> 56:37.391
Nothing much.

56:37.426 --> 56:39.096
But I'm sure he will tell me

56:39.131 --> 56:40.999
if there is something
worth telling.

56:43.509 --> 56:45.641
I'm sure he'll fill you in
at the right time.

56:46.809 --> 56:48.435
How well can you know someone

56:48.470 --> 56:51.108
if you don't know their past?

56:51.143 --> 56:53.275
I think you should
take people as they are,

56:53.310 --> 56:54.947
you know?
People change.

56:54.982 --> 56:56.949
No point digging up skeletons.

56:56.984 --> 57:00.348
I call bullshit.

57:00.383 --> 57:02.955
Nobody has that much virtue.

57:02.990 --> 57:05.287
Given the opportunity,
we'd all snoop.

57:05.322 --> 57:08.499
Read their diaries,
texts, e-mails.

57:08.534 --> 57:11.425
Can't help it.
It's in our nature.

57:11.460 --> 57:14.538
I guess we'll just have to agree
to disagree.

57:16.168 --> 57:18.465
So you're not even
a teeny bit curious

57:18.500 --> 57:21.204
what he gets up to
behind those locked doors?

57:21.239 --> 57:22.975
What is your problem?

57:23.010 --> 57:24.174
Ow!

57:24.209 --> 57:25.846
I'm sorry, miss.

57:25.881 --> 57:28.343
I'm so sorry.
No, it's okay, honestly.

57:29.720 --> 57:31.280
Oh, Evie, you're bleeding.

57:31.315 --> 57:34.151
I'm fine. It's nothing.
- You poor thing.

57:35.154 --> 57:36.219
Let me see.

57:38.520 --> 57:40.564
What the fuck?

57:40.599 --> 57:42.324
Oh, my God.

57:42.359 --> 57:45.327
Evie, I'll come with you.
It's okay. I'll see you later.

57:45.362 --> 57:47.428
Just teasing you, baby doll.
Lighten up.

57:49.003 --> 57:51.740
You'll learn to love me.
Promise.

58:47.831 --> 58:48.797
Shit.

59:21.458 --> 59:23.161
Evie?

59:23.196 --> 59:24.327
You okay?

59:24.362 --> 59:25.295
I'm leaving.

59:26.870 --> 59:28.562
Why? Did Viktoria
say something?

59:28.597 --> 59:30.498
I do not care about Viktoria.
Hey, hey.

59:34.680 --> 59:36.746
Okay, look, I can explain this.

59:36.781 --> 59:38.407
What, that you were stalking me?

59:38.442 --> 59:40.013
Mm, that's a bit of a stretch.

59:40.048 --> 59:42.345
You have a file on your desk
with my name on it.

59:42.380 --> 59:44.248
If you let me explain--
I knew this was

59:44.283 --> 59:45.953
too good to be true.
Here's the evidence.

59:45.988 --> 59:47.350
Evidence of what?
You said

59:47.385 --> 59:48.758
you wanted to get to know me,

59:48.793 --> 59:50.485
but it's all here
in black and white.

59:50.520 --> 59:53.587
My mom's name, where I grew up,
my school. You knew everything.

59:53.622 --> 59:55.325
Let's not jump to conclusions.

59:55.360 --> 59:57.096
Do you vet everyone
who comes here,

59:57.131 --> 59:59.802
or is that reserved
for people like me?

59:59.837 --> 1:00:01.364
That's nothing to do with it.

1:00:01.399 --> 1:00:03.597
Smart thinking, getting
my criminal record checked.

1:00:03.632 --> 1:00:07.172
By the way, I had my tonsils
removed when I was 13 years old.

1:00:07.207 --> 1:00:09.306
Might wanna add that
to your little dossier.

1:00:09.341 --> 1:00:11.341
You're being obstinate.
You're being arrogant.

1:00:11.376 --> 1:00:13.849
You don't know what it's like
to have people use you

1:00:13.884 --> 1:00:15.785
and take advantage of you
all the time.

1:00:15.820 --> 1:00:17.886
Really? I don't know
what that's like?

1:00:17.921 --> 1:00:20.614
I wanted to know
a few things about you

1:00:20.649 --> 1:00:22.220
before I let you sleep
under my roof.

1:00:22.255 --> 1:00:23.859
Would you not have done
the same?

1:00:28.228 --> 1:00:30.195
When Oliver asked if he could
invite his long-lost cousin

1:00:30.230 --> 1:00:31.801
to the wedding,

1:00:31.836 --> 1:00:34.837
I asked if he could send
some information over on you

1:00:34.872 --> 1:00:37.741
to make sure that you weren't
an opportunist.

1:00:37.776 --> 1:00:39.908
It wouldn't be the first time.

1:00:39.943 --> 1:00:42.339
I despise technology,
and he knows that,

1:00:42.374 --> 1:00:44.539
so he printed out
a few pages for me.

1:00:44.574 --> 1:00:46.145
That is the extent of it.

1:00:46.180 --> 1:00:48.917
I do want to get to know you.

1:00:48.952 --> 1:00:52.283
The real you, not some bullet
points on a piece of paper.

1:00:53.352 --> 1:00:55.154
And, yes, I would be lying

1:00:55.189 --> 1:00:58.553
if I said I wasn't intrigued
by what I saw.

1:01:00.964 --> 1:01:02.194
I am guilty of that.

1:01:08.037 --> 1:01:10.334
You should've just asked me.

1:01:10.369 --> 1:01:12.908
I know, and I'm sorry.

1:01:12.943 --> 1:01:14.107
And I made a mistake.

1:01:15.275 --> 1:01:16.439
It's just, I'm not...

1:01:17.475 --> 1:01:19.376
I'm not used to this.

1:01:19.411 --> 1:01:22.049
And I wasn't expecting you
to be you.

1:01:23.745 --> 1:01:25.283
I didn't expect you either.

1:01:31.258 --> 1:01:32.895
Did we just have
our first fight?

1:01:32.930 --> 1:01:34.127
Don't be charming.

1:01:35.801 --> 1:01:38.527
Do you think you're the only one
scared of getting hurt?

1:01:38.562 --> 1:01:41.871
Please, nothing frightens you.
Oh, yeah?

1:01:41.906 --> 1:01:44.907
When I saw you packing
your things, that scared me.

1:01:48.506 --> 1:01:49.813
Please, don't run away.

1:01:52.576 --> 1:01:53.476
Okay.

1:01:56.514 --> 1:01:57.711
No more secrets.

1:02:59.918 --> 1:03:02.116
We should get ready
for the rehearsal dinner.

1:03:03.218 --> 1:03:04.679
It's that time already?

1:03:04.714 --> 1:03:06.483
Mm-hm. I'm afraid so.

1:03:09.158 --> 1:03:13.259
Well, I can't wait to see
the wedding of the century.

1:03:15.098 --> 1:03:16.790
We should make it
a double wedding.

1:03:19.201 --> 1:03:21.069
Very funny.
Why not?

1:03:22.369 --> 1:03:24.732
Why not have a shotgun wedding?

1:03:24.767 --> 1:03:26.173
Yeah.
Oh, God.

1:03:26.208 --> 1:03:28.978
I mean, our families are here.

1:03:29.013 --> 1:03:31.343
All the arrangements
have been made.

1:03:31.378 --> 1:03:33.642
You are high on sex.

1:03:33.677 --> 1:03:36.887
We should live in the moment.
Throw caution to the wind.

1:03:38.253 --> 1:03:39.516
Okay, fine. I accept.

1:03:55.204 --> 1:03:57.864
I have left you a dress
in the wardrobe,

1:03:57.899 --> 1:03:59.371
in case you need
something to wear.

1:03:59.406 --> 1:04:01.043
Ugh. More gifts?

1:04:01.078 --> 1:04:02.275
Mm-hm.

1:04:10.318 --> 1:04:11.251
Walt.

1:04:12.419 --> 1:04:14.056
You know I was joking, right?

1:04:53.922 --> 1:04:55.757
Ah, there she is!

1:05:06.506 --> 1:05:08.077
Darling, please, sit down.

1:05:08.112 --> 1:05:10.310
The festivities
are about to start.

1:05:10.345 --> 1:05:11.278
Okay.

1:05:14.151 --> 1:05:16.646
Someone surely does
look the part.

1:05:18.188 --> 1:05:19.847
My dear friends.

1:05:19.882 --> 1:05:21.684
My comrades.

1:05:21.719 --> 1:05:23.356
I would like to formally welcome

1:05:23.391 --> 1:05:26.524
the three great families
to New Carfax.

1:05:26.559 --> 1:05:28.229
The Billingtons of Whitby.

1:05:29.727 --> 1:05:33.267
Klopstocks, Budapest.

1:05:33.302 --> 1:05:36.402
And the Alexanders of London.

1:05:38.967 --> 1:05:41.275
Let the feast begin.
Hear, hear.

1:05:46.843 --> 1:05:49.844
You are a vision.

1:05:51.650 --> 1:05:53.716
So that was intense.

1:05:53.751 --> 1:05:55.993
You know the English
and their traditions.

1:05:58.096 --> 1:06:01.757
I'm so glad that we can finally
be honest with each other.

1:06:03.761 --> 1:06:04.694
Me too.

1:06:06.170 --> 1:06:08.401
So where are
the bride and groom?

1:06:13.672 --> 1:06:15.903
Mm!

1:06:20.382 --> 1:06:22.910
If you'll all indulge me
for one more moment.

1:06:27.455 --> 1:06:30.885
Our four families have served
each other for generations.

1:06:31.789 --> 1:06:33.228
But as you all know,

1:06:33.263 --> 1:06:36.330
there has been someone
missing from this table,

1:06:36.365 --> 1:06:39.663
someone vital to our alliance.

1:06:39.698 --> 1:06:43.700
And we've all felt
the strain of this imbalance.

1:06:43.735 --> 1:06:47.902
But tonight, that once-broken
bond will be renewed,

1:06:47.937 --> 1:06:49.442
refortified...

1:06:54.944 --> 1:06:57.846
...when Evelyn Alexander and I
are wed.

1:06:57.881 --> 1:06:58.913
Congratulations!

1:07:02.787 --> 1:07:04.556
What are you doing? Walt.

1:07:07.825 --> 1:07:10.727
Refreshments, please.
Walt, Walt.

1:07:14.667 --> 1:07:17.239
Oh, finally.
I was getting obscenely bored.

1:08:22.207 --> 1:08:23.239
My lord.

1:08:25.672 --> 1:08:27.705
For as long
as I care to remember,

1:08:27.740 --> 1:08:30.136
you lovely mortals
have provided me

1:08:30.171 --> 1:08:32.281
with the gift of wives.

1:08:32.316 --> 1:08:33.975
Three brides.

1:08:34.010 --> 1:08:36.714
Three. The magic number.

1:08:36.749 --> 1:08:40.322
And in return, you and your
families enjoyed safety

1:08:40.357 --> 1:08:42.115
and prosperity,

1:08:42.150 --> 1:08:43.985
for generations.

1:08:44.020 --> 1:08:47.461
We are at our strongest
when there are three.

1:08:47.496 --> 1:08:51.366
We can thrive
when there are three.

1:08:51.401 --> 1:08:54.061
When Emmaline,
my Alexander bride,

1:08:54.096 --> 1:08:57.207
chose to leave us,
our union was compromised.

1:08:57.242 --> 1:08:59.506
<i>Emmaline, my Alexander bride.</i>

1:08:59.541 --> 1:09:02.740
In 1925, your great-grandmother,
Emmaline...

1:09:02.775 --> 1:09:04.907
<i>Your great-grandmother...</i>
- Who's that?

1:09:04.942 --> 1:09:06.348
Former lady of the house.

1:09:06.383 --> 1:09:08.009
<i>She passed away recently.</i>

1:09:10.387 --> 1:09:15.049
Tonight, we celebrate
our eternal bond,

1:09:15.084 --> 1:09:18.789
the pact that your ancestors
made many, many moons ago.

1:09:20.298 --> 1:09:21.429
Charge your glasses.

1:09:23.862 --> 1:09:24.927
To Evie.

1:09:26.436 --> 1:09:29.096
My new bride.
- To Evie.

1:09:29.131 --> 1:09:31.670
You have brought new life...

1:09:31.705 --> 1:09:33.936
to these four walls.

1:09:33.971 --> 1:09:36.873
Maybe even enough to make
this old heart beat again.

1:09:38.140 --> 1:09:40.943
May the bridemaidens rejoice.

1:09:40.978 --> 1:09:43.286
The bridemaidens rejoice.

1:09:47.886 --> 1:09:50.425
I believe congratulations
are in order, dear cousin.

1:09:50.460 --> 1:09:52.460
I have to go.

1:09:52.495 --> 1:09:53.428
I have to...

1:10:03.341 --> 1:10:05.308
Please, let me go.

1:10:06.740 --> 1:10:08.201
I'm begging you, please.

1:10:08.236 --> 1:10:09.136
Evie.

1:10:11.679 --> 1:10:13.316
My love,
whatever is the matter?

1:10:16.849 --> 1:10:18.255
Hm?

1:10:19.753 --> 1:10:21.148
I want to go home.

1:10:22.591 --> 1:10:25.328
But this is your home.

1:10:25.363 --> 1:10:27.264
We are your family.

1:10:29.532 --> 1:10:33.765
Evie, I thought we agreed that
we were done with this charade.

1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:34.700
Hm?

1:10:35.604 --> 1:10:36.669
Secrets.

1:10:38.673 --> 1:10:41.311
We are now free
to be our true selves.

1:10:41.346 --> 1:10:42.279
No?

1:10:43.876 --> 1:10:46.580
Why are you all
just sitting there?

1:10:46.615 --> 1:10:49.319
Do something. Help me.

1:10:51.950 --> 1:10:54.456
You're all monsters. All of you!
Miss.

1:10:54.491 --> 1:10:55.490
You're sick!

1:10:57.362 --> 1:10:58.922
Don't take her words to heart.

1:10:58.957 --> 1:11:00.792
You know how difficult
brides can be.

1:11:02.026 --> 1:11:02.992
Help!

1:11:04.402 --> 1:11:05.500
Help me.

1:11:09.165 --> 1:11:11.297
You're embarrassing me.

1:11:11.332 --> 1:11:12.672
Hey.

1:11:12.707 --> 1:11:15.070
Hey, shh.
Hey, hey. Hey, it's me.

1:11:16.909 --> 1:11:17.842
No.

1:11:24.081 --> 1:11:26.686
Get her prepared.
Tonight is yours.

1:11:26.721 --> 1:11:28.556
Tomorrow is mine.

1:11:28.591 --> 1:11:30.888
Welcome our new bride
to the family.

1:11:32.188 --> 1:11:33.396
Eat. Come on, eat.

1:12:11.062 --> 1:12:13.766
Welcome to your bachelorette
party, Evie.

1:12:13.801 --> 1:12:15.933
Hey, no, no, no.

1:12:15.968 --> 1:12:17.165
Don't cry.

1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:19.002
We'll soon be just like sisters.

1:12:19.037 --> 1:12:22.071
Three perfect little dolls
for the master.

1:12:22.106 --> 1:12:24.546
Please, let me go.
- Enough already.

1:12:24.581 --> 1:12:27.549
Even your great-grandmother
wasn't this difficult.

1:12:27.584 --> 1:12:29.782
Till she refused
to feed on the help.

1:12:29.817 --> 1:12:31.751
Truly selfish act.

1:12:31.786 --> 1:12:33.456
She put us all in jeopardy.

1:12:33.491 --> 1:12:34.952
Emmaline was lovely.

1:12:34.987 --> 1:12:37.856
And we were such great friends.
She just...

1:12:37.891 --> 1:12:39.627
Well, she became confused.

1:12:39.662 --> 1:12:41.629
But you...

1:12:41.664 --> 1:12:44.093
You won't let us down
like she did, will you, Evie?

1:12:46.328 --> 1:12:48.031
That thing...

1:12:48.066 --> 1:12:49.967
in my room, that was you?

1:12:50.002 --> 1:12:52.607
Apologies.
I was in a playful mood.

1:12:54.270 --> 1:12:55.302
Why?

1:12:55.337 --> 1:12:57.711
Why are you doing this to me?

1:12:57.746 --> 1:12:59.614
For your blood, of course.

1:12:59.649 --> 1:13:01.748
Our bloodlines are rare.

1:13:01.783 --> 1:13:03.211
They're special.

1:13:03.246 --> 1:13:04.784
And the combination of them

1:13:04.819 --> 1:13:07.721
makes the four of us
all-powerful.

1:13:07.756 --> 1:13:10.053
Immune to the effects of time.

1:13:10.088 --> 1:13:12.495
Look, we were both once
in the exact

1:13:12.530 --> 1:13:14.563
same position as you are,
Evie.

1:13:14.598 --> 1:13:18.259
Though choices were limited
for women back then.

1:13:18.294 --> 1:13:20.767
Viktoria has been with him
for 500 years.

1:13:20.802 --> 1:13:22.835
Me, only a hundred.

1:13:22.870 --> 1:13:26.003
At the ceremony,
you'll be bound to the master.

1:13:26.038 --> 1:13:27.576
And to us.

1:13:27.611 --> 1:13:29.303
But to make the bond permanent,

1:13:29.338 --> 1:13:31.305
you must first consume
his blood.

1:13:31.340 --> 1:13:33.406
When you drink,
you will absorb his power.

1:13:33.441 --> 1:13:35.584
You will gain the strength
of a hundred men.

1:13:35.619 --> 1:13:38.015
But only after the master
drinks your blood

1:13:38.050 --> 1:13:40.820
will we all be granted
eternal life.

1:13:40.855 --> 1:13:44.021
You'll enjoy your powers
for as long as he lives.

1:13:49.963 --> 1:13:51.358
No.

1:13:51.393 --> 1:13:53.129
No, no, no, no, no.

1:13:57.641 --> 1:14:00.466
No, don't! Don't.

1:14:00.501 --> 1:14:01.544
You like this one?

1:14:05.011 --> 1:14:06.516
Dee.

1:14:08.883 --> 1:14:12.049
Clean this one up.
Hold it for the ceremony.

1:14:12.084 --> 1:14:15.118
The new mistress
has taken a shine to it.

1:14:16.891 --> 1:14:18.726
Look, Evie.

1:14:18.761 --> 1:14:19.694
Your new home.

1:14:21.225 --> 1:14:22.697
Please, don't put me in there.

1:14:22.732 --> 1:14:24.699
No, no, no. Don't worry.

1:14:24.734 --> 1:14:27.064
You can still be outside
during the day.

1:14:27.099 --> 1:14:30.067
There are so many
misconceptions about our kind.

1:14:37.340 --> 1:14:38.306
Please.

1:14:38.341 --> 1:14:39.373
Say good night.

1:14:39.408 --> 1:14:41.177
No. No! No, stop!

1:14:41.212 --> 1:14:42.310
Help!

1:14:44.182 --> 1:14:45.786
No, no.

1:14:49.055 --> 1:14:51.418
No! Stop!

1:14:54.731 --> 1:14:56.291
No, don't leave me in here.

1:14:59.197 --> 1:15:00.361
No!

1:15:03.872 --> 1:15:05.608
No!

1:15:05.643 --> 1:15:07.236
No, help.

1:15:12.408 --> 1:15:13.308
Help!

1:15:34.595 --> 1:15:35.495
Shit.

1:15:58.256 --> 1:15:59.156
Quickly now.

1:16:01.963 --> 1:16:03.325
You have to be quiet.

1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:04.964
Wait.

1:16:04.999 --> 1:16:07.131
Diya.
You'll have to send help.

1:16:07.166 --> 1:16:09.265
Why are you helping me?

1:16:09.300 --> 1:16:11.432
Your great-grandmother
was a dear friend.

1:16:12.710 --> 1:16:14.006
She held out
as long as she could,

1:16:14.041 --> 1:16:15.601
for everyone's sake.

1:16:15.636 --> 1:16:17.570
But in the end,
being married to a monster

1:16:17.605 --> 1:16:19.440
was too much to bear.

1:16:20.850 --> 1:16:21.915
Move quickly.

1:16:21.950 --> 1:16:23.609
If you see one, a stake,

1:16:23.644 --> 1:16:26.018
beheading or fire
are the only ways to kill them.

1:16:26.053 --> 1:16:29.450
Don't stop running till you're
on a plane out of England.

1:16:29.485 --> 1:16:30.891
What'll happen to you?

1:16:32.059 --> 1:16:33.388
I'll get what I deserve.

1:16:34.996 --> 1:16:36.864
Go, go, go.

1:16:53.916 --> 1:16:56.378
Let's go! Lock those doors!

1:16:57.579 --> 1:16:58.754
Move, move!

1:17:25.211 --> 1:17:27.046
You men, over there!
Right.

1:18:12.258 --> 1:18:13.796
Scour the grounds.

1:18:14.964 --> 1:18:16.458
She won't get far.
Sir.

1:18:58.040 --> 1:19:01.173
We will hunt you down!

1:19:45.153 --> 1:19:47.450
Help me. Help me, please.

1:19:47.485 --> 1:19:49.650
I'm sorry,
we don't have any money.

1:19:49.685 --> 1:19:50.992
Please.

1:19:51.027 --> 1:19:53.588
They're coming for me, please.
De Ville.

1:19:56.329 --> 1:19:58.659
Jonathan,
there's a girl out here.

1:20:15.414 --> 1:20:16.347
Here, dear.

1:20:18.285 --> 1:20:20.021
You're shaking.

1:20:21.057 --> 1:20:23.783
Chamomile. Soothes the soul.

1:20:25.358 --> 1:20:26.720
Yes, hello.

1:20:26.755 --> 1:20:28.392
Mr. Harker here.

1:20:28.427 --> 1:20:30.823
Yeah, there's a young lady here

1:20:30.858 --> 1:20:33.067
who seems quite distressed.

1:20:33.102 --> 1:20:34.761
Yes.

1:20:37.238 --> 1:20:39.804
I can't quite hear them, dear.
Could you try?

1:20:42.870 --> 1:20:44.881
Hello, this is Mina Harker.

1:20:46.984 --> 1:20:52.647
Yeah, well, the girl says she,
well, escaped from New Carfax.

1:20:55.652 --> 1:20:58.092
Well, I know.
It's terribly alarming, yeah.

1:21:01.295 --> 1:21:02.492
Oh, yes, I know.

1:21:04.265 --> 1:21:06.562
I've just made her
a cup of tea.

1:21:10.436 --> 1:21:12.370
Have a sip, my dear.

1:21:12.405 --> 1:21:14.636
It's good for the nerves.

1:21:15.980 --> 1:21:17.276
Yes, of course.

1:21:17.311 --> 1:21:19.641
Oh, it's our honor, really.

1:21:24.318 --> 1:21:25.482
They're on their way.

1:21:30.654 --> 1:21:33.094
You really should
drink your tea.

1:21:50.047 --> 1:21:52.839
Don't fuck this up
for all of us, my dear.

1:22:43.727 --> 1:22:46.266
It was a gallant attempt.
I'll give you that.

1:22:50.701 --> 1:22:53.207
I trust you have it
out of your system now.

1:22:54.672 --> 1:22:55.704
Who are you?

1:22:55.739 --> 1:22:57.046
Mm...

1:23:09.192 --> 1:23:15.889
In the old country, they called
my kind<i> strigoi</i> or<i> nosferatu.</i>

1:23:15.924 --> 1:23:21.532
And in Wallachia, they called me
Son of the Dragon.

1:23:21.567 --> 1:23:23.732
A sobriquet I rather enjoy.

1:23:25.472 --> 1:23:27.208
Are you telling me you're...?

1:23:32.413 --> 1:23:36.481
Evie, Evie, Evie. Think about
what you're gaining here.

1:23:38.749 --> 1:23:41.123
Wealth, power.

1:23:41.158 --> 1:23:44.016
Great strength, life eternal.

1:23:44.051 --> 1:23:46.227
No more sickness,
like your mother had.

1:23:46.262 --> 1:23:48.262
No struggle. No longer confined

1:23:48.297 --> 1:23:51.694
by the frailty
of human existence.

1:23:51.729 --> 1:23:54.169
A life of privilege.

1:23:56.470 --> 1:23:58.569
A sense of belonging.

1:23:58.604 --> 1:24:01.473
And a family
entirely dedicated to you.

1:24:01.508 --> 1:24:03.145
Isn't that why you came here?

1:24:04.577 --> 1:24:06.808
Isn't that what you want?

1:24:06.843 --> 1:24:08.007
Hmm?

1:24:10.319 --> 1:24:12.319
For someone of your...

1:24:12.354 --> 1:24:14.387
mm...

1:24:14.422 --> 1:24:15.586
background,

1:24:15.621 --> 1:24:17.423
surely this is more than
a leg up.

1:24:34.871 --> 1:24:38.147
It would make your life
so much easier...

1:24:39.843 --> 1:24:41.381
if you came willingly.

1:24:48.324 --> 1:24:50.456
Regardless, you have
no say in the matter.

1:24:50.491 --> 1:24:53.855
You already agreed
to my proposal.

1:24:53.890 --> 1:24:56.088
You tricked me.

1:24:56.123 --> 1:24:58.860
Fortunately for me,
the fine print's irrelevant.

1:25:08.806 --> 1:25:09.706
Excuse me.

1:25:30.861 --> 1:25:32.201
Mmm!

1:25:34.161 --> 1:25:36.271
The fibula is so underrated,
in my opinion.

1:27:17.132 --> 1:27:18.098
Stop smiling.

1:27:43.026 --> 1:27:47.292
I'm so glad you've come
to your senses, my love.

1:27:47.327 --> 1:27:50.196
We are gathered here
this evening

1:27:50.231 --> 1:27:54.640
to sanctify the union
between our benevolent master

1:27:54.675 --> 1:27:58.545
and his new bride
from the Alexander bloodline.

1:28:00.076 --> 1:28:02.274
Long may they flourish.

1:28:02.309 --> 1:28:05.211
May the bridemaidens rejoice.

1:28:06.489 --> 1:28:07.587
Master.

1:28:09.250 --> 1:28:11.591
Do you take this woman
to be your bride?

1:28:14.189 --> 1:28:15.221
I do.

1:28:16.356 --> 1:28:20.028
And do you, Evelyn Alexander,

1:28:20.063 --> 1:28:23.405
take the master to love, honor,

1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:27.101
serve, and obey, for all
the days of your eternal life?

1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:40.719
<i>It all ends here.</i>

1:28:43.086 --> 1:28:45.152
<i>With me.</i>

1:28:45.187 --> 1:28:46.989
<i>Just know</i>
<i>that when things are hard,</i>

1:28:47.024 --> 1:28:49.431
<i>you're stronger</i>
<i>than you think you are.</i>

1:28:49.466 --> 1:28:52.258
<i>You will absorb his power.</i>

1:28:52.293 --> 1:28:53.765
<i>...absorb his power.</i>

1:28:57.100 --> 1:28:58.033
Yes.

1:29:01.368 --> 1:29:04.105
May you now exchange blood.

1:29:32.069 --> 1:29:34.036
Slow down, dear.

1:29:34.071 --> 1:29:35.972
There's plenty more to come.

1:30:56.384 --> 1:30:57.922
I want her next.

1:31:23.081 --> 1:31:24.179
No!

1:31:24.214 --> 1:31:25.213
No.

1:31:25.248 --> 1:31:26.621
No, no, no.

1:31:38.129 --> 1:31:39.832
Evie, please, Evie...

1:31:46.203 --> 1:31:47.136
No.

1:32:36.660 --> 1:32:40.728
You think you can change
thousands of years,

1:32:40.763 --> 1:32:42.290
just like that?

1:32:42.325 --> 1:32:45.128
I killed him. It's over.

1:32:45.163 --> 1:32:46.558
You silly girl.

1:32:46.593 --> 1:32:48.670
It was just a flesh wound.

1:32:48.705 --> 1:32:50.430
If he were dead,

1:32:50.465 --> 1:32:52.333
I wouldn't be able to do this.

1:33:05.150 --> 1:33:07.117
No. Diya, go get help.

1:33:11.651 --> 1:33:13.288
You're pathetic.

1:33:13.323 --> 1:33:15.422
You're not one of us.

1:33:15.457 --> 1:33:16.698
You're a halfling.

1:33:18.460 --> 1:33:19.525
That all you got?

1:33:21.969 --> 1:33:23.397
You're nothing.

1:33:35.642 --> 1:33:38.148
What do you think you're doing?

1:33:38.183 --> 1:33:40.986
It's enough, Viktoria. Please.

1:33:41.021 --> 1:33:42.889
You get back in line.

1:33:43.892 --> 1:33:44.957
No.

1:33:44.992 --> 1:33:45.892
No?

1:33:48.160 --> 1:33:50.028
No.

1:33:50.063 --> 1:33:51.898
You don't tell me
what to do anymore.

1:35:20.087 --> 1:35:22.252
I told Master
that you were subpar

1:35:22.287 --> 1:35:23.990
the moment
he mentioned you.

1:35:24.025 --> 1:35:28.764
That you were so beneath
our standards.

1:35:30.493 --> 1:35:33.395
I should have slit that baby's
throat, your grandfather,

1:35:33.430 --> 1:35:35.760
when I had the chance.

1:35:35.795 --> 1:35:39.808
I am going to enjoy
cutting your head off

1:35:39.843 --> 1:35:42.668
and feeding it
to the fucking wolves!

1:35:58.961 --> 1:35:59.861
Asshole.

1:36:51.211 --> 1:36:53.882
I was doing you a favor.

1:36:53.917 --> 1:36:58.216
Saving you from your miserable
excuse for existence.

1:36:58.251 --> 1:37:00.416
Giving you a family.

1:37:00.451 --> 1:37:02.154
Status, privilege.

1:37:02.189 --> 1:37:04.992
All the power in the world.

1:37:05.027 --> 1:37:08.193
I would rather die
than be a part of this.

1:37:08.228 --> 1:37:12.461
You modern women
are so ungrateful.

1:37:13.464 --> 1:37:15.860
All those women.

1:37:15.895 --> 1:37:16.938
You're a monster.

1:37:16.973 --> 1:37:19.039
I am a god!

1:37:20.372 --> 1:37:22.306
I hope you all burn.

1:37:38.291 --> 1:37:39.719
You...

1:39:09.877 --> 1:39:11.514
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

1:39:11.549 --> 1:39:14.484
We've paid off the cops.
It's bought us some time.

1:39:14.519 --> 1:39:18.224
We have to destroy the evidence
and get the fuck out of town.

1:39:18.259 --> 1:39:20.061
Don't worry, she's mortal.

1:39:22.263 --> 1:39:23.856
She doesn't have any powers.

1:39:26.399 --> 1:39:29.037
All right, all right.
I'll get back to you.

1:39:32.537 --> 1:39:34.966
Still the whitest man
I've ever seen.

1:39:35.001 --> 1:39:37.177
Mm-hm.
I gotta say,

1:39:37.212 --> 1:39:39.179
I'm loving
this whole look on you.

1:39:39.214 --> 1:39:41.082
Well, thank you.
Mm-hm.

1:39:41.117 --> 1:39:43.051
Out with the old,
in with the new.

1:39:46.353 --> 1:39:47.814
You know the plan?

1:39:47.849 --> 1:39:50.157
Yep, we go in there
and take him the F out.

1:39:50.192 --> 1:39:52.390
Exactly.
But let me take the lead.

1:39:52.425 --> 1:39:53.721
Mm-hm.

1:39:53.756 --> 1:39:55.822
Don't wanna be relegated
to the sidekick?

1:39:55.857 --> 1:39:58.957
Please, I have always been
your sidekick.

1:40:03.106 --> 1:40:05.370
All right, sis. Ready?

1:40:06.571 --> 1:40:09.000
For you? Always.

1:40:17.076 --> 1:40:19.351
Wait, where did you get a bat?

1:40:19.386 --> 1:40:20.715
It's ironic, right?

1:40:20.750 --> 1:40:22.948
Bat, vampire.

1:40:22.983 --> 1:40:25.225
