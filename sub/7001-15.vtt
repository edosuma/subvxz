01:12.970 --> 01:15.039
We were on a manly mission today, honey.

01:15.130 --> 01:18.160
I initiated Mark. I took him
down to Kelley's Hardware Store.

01:18.250 --> 01:20.119
We went through every inch of that.

01:20.210 --> 01:24.240
- Mark, where are the router bits?
- Aisle 2-A.

01:24.329 --> 01:26.519
All right. Screwdrivers?

01:27.730 --> 01:28.710
Aisle 3-B.

01:28.809 --> 01:31.640
- What's on the top shelf?
- Phillips head.

01:31.730 --> 01:36.119
- What kind of handle do they have?
- Square-shanked, slotted?

01:36.210 --> 01:37.960
Yeah.

01:38.490 --> 01:40.279
Yeah.

01:41.130 --> 01:43.000
You are a man today, Mark.

01:43.089 --> 01:47.000
And, you know, a man just
isn't a man without his own...

01:47.089 --> 01:49.920
Hank the Handyman drill.

01:51.130 --> 01:54.279
- Thanks. Dad.
- Honey, you should've been there with us.

01:54.369 --> 01:57.480
It was the winter warehouse sale.
Everything was half off.

01:57.569 --> 02:00.680
Yeah, and I suppose
yo4 only got the essentials.

02:00.769 --> 02:05.359
You bet. Butterfly hinges,
casing knife, point driver...

02:05.450 --> 02:11.119
Well, every house needs a point driver.
What is this essential thing?

02:13.450 --> 02:16.039
This is the ultimate power tool.

02:16.130 --> 02:19.519
Binford's best 4000 series...

02:19.609 --> 02:21.990
reciprocating saw.

02:22.089 --> 02:26.000
Three-quarter-horse motor. No tool arsenal
is complete without this thing.

02:26.089 --> 02:30.240
Pure power. You could saw through
the refrigerator with this thing.

02:30.329 --> 02:33.279
Wouldn't it be easier to open the door?

02:33.369 --> 02:35.200
- Mom. Dad.
- Yeah, honey?

02:35.289 --> 02:39.519
Jennifer Sudarsky wants to take me to her
parents' anniversary party tomorrow night.

02:39.609 --> 02:43.759
- Wow. That sounds like fun.
- first date. Hot stuff.

02:43.849 --> 02:45.640
It's not a date.

02:45.730 --> 02:49.039
Me and Jennifer are just gonna go
to her country club and have dinner.

02:49.130 --> 02:55.640
Not a date. So when she introduces you,
it'll be. "Hi, this is Brad, my eating partner."

02:55.730 --> 02:56.839
Dad.

02:56.930 --> 03:00.359
The country club.
You're gonna get to get all dressed up.

03:00.450 --> 03:03.640
- But you know what? You need a new tie.
- What's wrong with the tie I've got?

03:03.730 --> 03:07.799
Nothing, except I don't think
the Slurpee stains go with your shirt.

03:07.890 --> 03:11.589
- Karen and I will pick you up a new one.
- OK. Thanks. Mom.

03:11.690 --> 03:15.279
- Karen's coming over here?
- Yes. She'll be here any minute.

03:15.369 --> 03:19.119
Every time she comes over, she twists
everything I say into a feminist argument.

03:19.210 --> 03:23.039
- Why don't you meet her at the store?
- Come on, Tim. She's my good friend.

03:23.130 --> 03:25.119
I like her.

03:25.210 --> 03:29.240
- She just comes over to make fun of me.
- That's why I like her.

03:29.809 --> 03:32.799
- Hi.
- You look so pretty.

03:32.890 --> 03:34.839
- I love your skirt.
- Thanks.

03:34.930 --> 03:37.359
So, you wanna have some coffee
and fat food before we go?

03:37.450 --> 03:41.039
- Yes, yes. Let's do.
- Tim is so looking forward to seeing you.

03:41.130 --> 03:43.880
And me him. Hello, Tim.

03:43.970 --> 03:48.640
- Hi. Karen. How's work?
- Good. What in the world is that?

03:48.730 --> 03:52.720
Come on. Karen. Don't you know
a reciprocating saw when you see one?

03:52.809 --> 03:57.799
It cuts through any thick surface -
refrigerator, walls, Tim's head.

04:01.210 --> 04:03.720
I think we know why Tim bought that.

04:03.809 --> 04:07.319
OK, here we go.
What are we gonna make fun of today?

04:07.410 --> 04:10.240
My show? No. Grunting? Tools.

04:10.329 --> 04:14.519
Well, Tim. I mean,
it is a very big, powerful tool.

04:14.609 --> 04:18.480
I see. You think I've got to have this
just to prove my manhood.

04:18.569 --> 04:20.480
You said it. I didn't say that.

04:20.569 --> 04:26.079
I bought the saw because it saws.
That's what saws do. Karen. They saw.

04:26.170 --> 04:28.160
It certainly is a large saw.

04:29.890 --> 04:32.269
Well, thank you very much.

04:33.849 --> 04:36.150
I'll be in the garage where I belong.

04:36.250 --> 04:39.759
Men get so insecure
when you make fun of their tools.

04:39.849 --> 04:41.599
Tell me about it.

04:43.009 --> 04:45.720
I am not insecure.

04:45.809 --> 04:50.519
Honey, when we say "men",
we're not talking about yo4.

04:52.250 --> 04:56.029
You gals go ahead and laugh. I just
want you to know I'm a very secure man.

04:56.130 --> 05:01.359
You know, Jill. I can understand why
men like all these big, powerful tools.

05:01.450 --> 05:03.750
Do tell.

05:03.849 --> 05:05.759
All right.

05:05.849 --> 05:09.720
They feed right into their destructive
and aggressive...

05:10.730 --> 05:12.319
tendencies.

05:12.410 --> 05:15.240
Well, thank you. Oprah.

05:16.329 --> 05:19.440
Come on, Tim.
Look at all the wars you've started.

05:19.529 --> 05:21.910
Jill, how many wars have I started?

05:22.009 --> 05:24.599
She just means that
most wars are started by men.

05:24.690 --> 05:29.519
Women start wars, too.
Did you see the film. War of the Amazons?

05:30.369 --> 05:33.759
- Whoa. He's got us there.
- Oh, boy, does he ever.

05:34.490 --> 05:36.950
I'll have you know
those were very fierce soldiers.

05:37.049 --> 05:38.759
I had nightmares
about that movie.

05:38.849 --> 05:43.119
So you're intimidated by strong women?
Is that what you're saying, Tim?

05:44.130 --> 05:46.690
When they're in groups and naked, yeah.

05:49.609 --> 05:53.200
Now that we've sanded down our table top,
it's time to apply the decorative laminate.

05:53.289 --> 05:55.480
Al, you wanna spread
the glue for me, please?

05:55.569 --> 05:57.559
I live to laminate, Tim.

05:59.849 --> 06:03.160
While Al does that.
I'd like to speak to you, if I could.

06:03.250 --> 06:04.839
I'm a little cheesed.

06:04.930 --> 06:08.359
Some people say the reason men are
into tools is because we're insecure.

06:08.450 --> 06:11.279
These same people say
that men are into more power

06:11.369 --> 06:13.559
because we're destructive
and aggressive.

06:13.650 --> 06:17.640
Well, let me explain something to you.
We're neither destructive or aggressive.

06:17.730 --> 06:20.720
What we are is creative.

06:20.809 --> 06:24.880
Let's look at some of the things
built over time using tools.

06:25.890 --> 06:29.119
The great pyramids of Egypt.

06:29.210 --> 06:33.119
The Great Wall of China.

06:33.450 --> 06:35.440
Indy.

06:37.569 --> 06:39.359
of Indy.

06:39.450 --> 06:41.240
The Leaning Tower of Pisa.

06:41.329 --> 06:46.349
Tim. I believe the Leaning Tower was
considered a huge structural mistake.

06:48.970 --> 06:51.799
Look at that.
That's an accomplishment.

06:51.890 --> 06:56.480
This tower's been leaning for
over 800 years, and it hasn't fallen over.

06:56.569 --> 06:59.359
Kind of reminds me of my mother-in-law.

07:00.369 --> 07:02.039
I'm kidding. Nana.

07:02.130 --> 07:05.720
- Well, the glue is spread, Tim.
- Is it, Al? OK.

07:06.609 --> 07:10.309
Before we get to gluing. I want to
introduce Binford's new Miracle Glue.

07:10.410 --> 07:14.109
Tim, you might wanna remind our viewers
to be careful when using this glue.

07:14.210 --> 07:17.079
because it will bond instantly to your skin.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.799
Al...

07:18.890 --> 07:23.359
We learned in the first grade
you're not supposed to play with glue.

07:23.450 --> 07:28.039
Well. I was just worried about our viewers'
welfare, as well as your welfare.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.799
Al, these negative thoughts

07:30.890 --> 07:34.279
- can hurt people on the job site.
- I don't have negative thoughts.

07:34.369 --> 07:35.640
- You do too.
- No. I don't.

07:35.730 --> 07:36.759
- Do too.
- Do not.

07:36.849 --> 07:38.680
Do.Not.

07:43.250 --> 07:45.599
Maybe it would be better
if I just swept up here, then.

07:45.690 --> 07:48.960
Maybe it would be better
if you just swept up. Mr Negativity.

07:49.049 --> 07:51.039
Not.Do.

07:52.089 --> 07:55.869
You wanna set your laminate securely
on your shimmies, front and back...

08:05.170 --> 08:08.319
Al. Al!

08:10.210 --> 08:14.440
We'll be right back
after these messages from Binford.

08:15.529 --> 08:18.960
Al? Al. I know you're back there.

08:23.210 --> 08:25.440
- Dad's home.
- I'd better go.

08:25.529 --> 08:27.519
I don't think Tim wants to see me.

08:27.609 --> 08:30.170
No, no, stay.
We'll just take it easy on him.

08:30.250 --> 08:33.679
OK. No more making fun.

08:46.569 --> 08:48.920
What is this thing on your head?

08:49.009 --> 08:51.000
It's a little piece of table.

08:53.769 --> 08:54.910
What happened?

08:55.009 --> 08:59.079
Old Mr Negativity, Al, distracted me
and I got my head cemented to this table.

08:59.170 --> 09:02.200
He had to take a sabre saw
to get me off of that table.

09:02.289 --> 09:04.319
Don't you think
you should go to the emergency room?

09:04.410 --> 09:07.400
I was just there.
They said I wasn't a priority.

09:08.650 --> 09:12.000
Why? Was there a guy
with a whole table stuck to his head?

09:16.769 --> 09:19.839
I'm sorry, honey.
We'll be good.

09:19.930 --> 09:22.519
- You notice I'm not laughing.
- Yeah. We'll be good.

09:22.609 --> 09:26.119
Come on, come on. Right.
Randy, set the table.

09:26.210 --> 09:28.440
OK. Dad, bend over.

09:39.210 --> 09:41.960
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- Yes.

09:42.049 --> 09:45.750
The hospital said that nail-polish remover
would soften the glue.

09:45.849 --> 09:48.640
You must have felt pretty silly
walking in there like that.

09:48.730 --> 09:49.920
Nonsense. Karen.

09:50.009 --> 09:53.880
There were a lot of people in there
with furniture stuck to their heads.

09:53.970 --> 09:57.319
- I still don't understand how you did this.
- I did it because of you mo.

09:57.410 --> 09:59.119
- Us?
- What did we do?

09:59.210 --> 10:00.799
I was trying to make a point on the show

10:00.890 --> 10:04.480
that men don't just destroy things
with hammers and nails and tools.

10:04.569 --> 10:07.079
No, they also glue.

10:08.170 --> 10:12.240
I'm sorry, honey. We shouldn't make fun -
although I did hear a great joke today.

10:12.329 --> 10:14.359
Knock, knock.

10:17.690 --> 10:21.390
The point I was trying to make
is that men don't just start wars.

10:21.490 --> 10:25.720
They build things with tools,
like this house, your car, office buildings...

10:25.809 --> 10:28.880
- Of course they do. They have all the jobs.
- Here we go.

10:28.969 --> 10:31.269
Come on, Tim, face it.

10:31.369 --> 10:35.480
It's a male-dominated society, and women
have to make all the compromises.

10:35.570 --> 10:37.559
I don't know what world you live in.

10:37.650 --> 10:41.190
but here at the Taylor household
we have an equal relationship.

10:41.289 --> 10:43.719
Do you really believe that, Tim?

10:43.809 --> 10:47.400
We're a '90s couple. We share everything
50-50, right down the middle.

10:47.489 --> 10:50.440
- Come sit down.
- OK. OK. Let me give you a little test.

10:50.530 --> 10:55.469
- Jill gets a high-paying executive position.
- I like this test already.

10:55.570 --> 10:58.159
- Do I get to have a male secretary?
- You got him.

10:58.250 --> 11:01.320
- Can't type, but he looks cute in jeans.
- Perfect.

11:01.409 --> 11:04.159
OK. So, Tim, should she take this job?

11:04.250 --> 11:06.400
If he's gay.

11:12.409 --> 11:14.760
Yeah, absolutely.

11:14.849 --> 11:18.519
- The job's in Seattle.
- That's fine. It's fine.

11:18.610 --> 11:21.280
Well, maybe Jill
doesn't wanna uproot the kids.

11:21.369 --> 11:25.119
No, no. The kids love the idea.
Do we move, Tim?

11:25.210 --> 11:28.719
- Karen, this is stupid.
- OK. Let me ask you another question.

11:28.809 --> 11:33.119
Tool Time goes national, but you have
to move to New York. Do you go?

11:33.210 --> 11:36.199
Yeah. It's my job.
It'd be the perfect op...

11:37.210 --> 11:39.800
If it's OK with Jill.

11:39.889 --> 11:43.360
So you're saying that your job
is more important than hers?

11:43.449 --> 11:45.719
- She doesn't have a job.
- Answer the question.

11:45.809 --> 11:47.800
Do you move to New York or Seattle?

11:47.889 --> 11:50.880
I think a lot depends on
where you'll be living.

11:51.769 --> 11:55.280
- Which is it, Tim?
- Look, she's just trying to confuse me.

11:55.369 --> 11:57.829
- You're avoiding the question.
- I am not avoiding the question.

11:57.929 --> 12:01.000
- Is it Seattle or New York, Tim?
- Detroit.

12:01.090 --> 12:04.239
Hey, that's not answering the question.
New York or Seattle?

12:04.329 --> 12:05.519
New York, Seattle...

12:05.610 --> 12:09.480
You know, I don't care where we live.
Just leave... leave me...

12:09.570 --> 12:12.199
Leave me alone.

12:12.289 --> 12:14.320
That had to hurt.

12:14.409 --> 12:16.440
No, it didn't.

12:24.610 --> 12:29.469
- Mom. I'm not gonna go to the party.
- What's the matter, honey?

12:29.570 --> 12:33.920
I just found out there's gonna be
an orchestra. That means I have to dance.

12:34.010 --> 12:37.480
- That'll be fun.
- No, it won't.

12:37.570 --> 12:41.719
- I'll have to do old-people dancing.
- Old-people dancing?

12:41.809 --> 12:43.960
Yeah, the kind you and Dad do.

12:45.409 --> 12:49.599
You mean really old,
like where you have to touch and junk?

12:49.690 --> 12:51.159
Yeah.

12:51.250 --> 12:56.719
Well, what if I teach you how to do that
old-people, touching-dancing-junk thing?

12:56.809 --> 12:59.480
Would you go to the dance then?

12:59.570 --> 13:01.400
I guess.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.949
Well, it's really very simple.

13:04.050 --> 13:07.559
I can't believe I get to teach
my oldest son how to dance.

13:08.969 --> 13:11.559
OK. Come here. Come on. Come on.

13:13.929 --> 13:18.639
Come on. You're gonna have to stand up
real straight, like a soldier. OK?

13:18.730 --> 13:21.559
Put this hand here on my back
and this left hand in my hand here.

13:21.650 --> 13:25.159
I can't dance with my mother.

13:26.449 --> 13:31.039
I used to change your diaper and
powder your butt. Now, get over here.

13:31.130 --> 13:34.639
Just follow me. It's a real simple box step.
Real easy. OK?

13:34.730 --> 13:39.280
Go left together, left together,
right together...

13:39.369 --> 13:43.199
- What's going on?
- Mom's teaching me how to dance.

13:43.289 --> 13:47.199
He's got to slow-dance tonight.
He's a little scared, but he's doing great.

13:47.289 --> 13:49.519
- I'm doing awful.
- You'll be great.

13:49.610 --> 13:52.320
You got a real good teacher.

13:52.409 --> 13:54.119
Ready?

13:54.210 --> 13:58.239
Left together, left together,
right together, right together.

13:58.329 --> 14:01.079
- That's very good.
- Left together, left together.

14:01.170 --> 14:03.679
- right together, right together.
- Very good.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.159
Wilson, do you think
I'm a peace-loving guy?

14:07.250 --> 14:08.639
Well, definitely, Tim.

14:08.730 --> 14:10.760
You ever known me to start any wars?

14:11.289 --> 14:14.480
No, but I was out of town
that one weekend.

14:15.610 --> 14:18.440
Every time Jill gets together
with her friend Karen.

14:18.530 --> 14:21.719
they accuse me of being aggressive
and destructive, starting wars.

14:21.809 --> 14:23.480
They blame me for everything.

14:23.570 --> 14:28.079
Well, Tim, that's just the burden you bear
for living in a patriarchal society.

14:28.170 --> 14:31.119
Yeah, patriarchal - dominated by men.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.199
That's right, Tim,

14:39.289 --> 14:42.039
from the Latin <i>pater</i>,
which means "father".

14:42.130 --> 14:46.159
Well, shiver my timbers.
Tim, I am impressed.

14:46.250 --> 14:50.480
Well, don't be.
I saw it on a rerun of <i>Mannix</i>.

14:50.570 --> 14:55.320
The point is, it's not my fault
that women have not ruled the world.

14:55.409 --> 14:59.559
- men have ruled the world.
- Well, that hasn't always been true, Tim.

15:00.170 --> 15:03.000
There was a time
when we had a matriarchal society.

15:03.090 --> 15:06.239
A matriarchal society.

15:07.690 --> 15:10.199
Run by maÃ®tre d's?

15:11.329 --> 15:15.079
No, Tim.
It's when women ruled the world.

15:15.170 --> 15:19.360
Get outta here. Where they didn't
have wars, they had Bake-Offs?

15:19.969 --> 15:22.480
No, Tim. You'd be surprised.

15:22.570 --> 15:26.400
Actually, the female of the species
can be very aggressive.

15:26.489 --> 15:30.030
So, what you're saying is
that when women ruled the world.

15:30.130 --> 15:33.880
- things weren't all that peaceful and nice.
- No. No, no, no, no, Tim.

15:33.969 --> 15:38.559
Absolute power corrupts absolutely,
with women as well as men.

15:38.650 --> 15:41.719
In ancient Africa,
they had entire female armies.

15:41.809 --> 15:45.349
In Babylon, they would burn
a man at the stake every spring

15:45.449 --> 15:48.519
to ensure the fertility of the crops.

15:49.610 --> 15:53.519
That's a hell of a price
to pay for zucchini.

15:54.530 --> 15:59.440
Well. I don't know. Maybe one day, men
and women will learn to share the power.

15:59.530 --> 16:01.800
to cooperate rather than dominate.

16:06.929 --> 16:10.920
Tim, honey, this is Jennifer Sudarsky.

16:11.010 --> 16:13.389
Jennifer, this is Brad's father.

16:13.489 --> 16:17.030
- So you're Jennifer.
- Hi. Mr Taylor. It's nice to meet you.

16:17.130 --> 16:19.800
- Nice to meet you. Sit down.
- Thank you.

16:24.769 --> 16:27.119
What's the matter with her?

16:32.809 --> 16:35.639
- Jennifer. I love your dress.
- Thank you.

16:35.730 --> 16:38.289
And your little coat.

16:40.610 --> 16:44.480
My dad watches your show. Mr Taylor.
He's a real big fan.

16:44.570 --> 16:48.840
- Hey. I'll get him an autographed picture.
- That would be great.

16:48.929 --> 16:52.550
Could you make it of Al?
He really loves Al.

16:58.570 --> 17:01.639
We all do.
Brad! Get on down here, will ya?

17:03.769 --> 17:06.150
I'll be down in a minute, father!

17:06.250 --> 17:08.519
"father"?

17:09.409 --> 17:11.400
Bradley's so polite.

17:12.650 --> 17:15.109
Mom. Dad,
guess what happened to Brad.

17:15.210 --> 17:19.239
- What is it?
- He got his tie stuck in his zipper.

17:21.569 --> 17:23.400
I'll be right back.

17:23.489 --> 17:25.719
Brad, don't fiddle with that.

17:27.489 --> 17:28.880
Son, are you all right?

17:28.969 --> 17:32.079
I got it out of my zipper,
but I can't get this tie straight.

17:32.170 --> 17:34.469
Come on, relax.
Come here, come here.

17:35.650 --> 17:37.840
It's just a simple tie. You did a good job.

17:37.929 --> 17:41.039
The old Windsor knot
always gives you trouble.

17:41.130 --> 17:44.750
Dad... I'm scared.

17:46.969 --> 17:49.429
It's good to be scared.
All guys are scared.

17:50.090 --> 17:51.639
- They are?
- Yeah.

17:51.730 --> 17:53.920
It goes way back to Babylon.

17:54.010 --> 17:58.920
when men were scared of being burned
at the stake by a bunch of maÃ®tre d's.

18:01.570 --> 18:08.119
Dad. I'm just scared when I hold her
my hands will get all sweaty and gross.

18:09.559 --> 18:12.069
Simple trick I used to do.

18:12.160 --> 18:15.470
Wad these up,
put 'em in your pants pockets.

18:15.559 --> 18:20.549
At the first hint of dampness, shove
your hands in your pockets, dry 'em off.

18:20.640 --> 18:24.470
bring 'em out
and you're back in the ball game.

18:24.559 --> 18:28.549
But what if I lead with the wrong foot
or step on her toes?

18:28.640 --> 18:33.390
- Dancing's not about who's leading.
- Mom says the man always leads.

18:33.480 --> 18:38.029
Well, when men and women
are dancing correctly, no one's leading.

18:38.119 --> 18:39.509
You just move with the music.

18:39.599 --> 18:42.309
You don't know how you get there,
but you just get there.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.670
That's kind of like how your mom drives.

18:52.039 --> 18:54.789
Brad, you look so handsome.

18:54.880 --> 18:59.029
You got a very excited young lady
waiting downstairs for you.

19:01.480 --> 19:04.349
Brad? Go get 'em, tiger.

19:10.240 --> 19:13.509
Good evening. Jennifer.
You look real good.

19:15.079 --> 19:17.539
You know, pretty. I mean.

19:17.640 --> 19:22.759
Thanks. So do you.
Not pretty, but, you know, handsome.

19:25.119 --> 19:27.109
Come here, you.

19:29.279 --> 19:32.190
I guess we should get going.
My father hates to wait.

19:32.279 --> 19:34.789
His stomach gets upset
and then he starts to burp.

19:34.880 --> 19:38.910
- OK, well. I just want to take one picture.
- Mom.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.950
Better hurry up, honey.
Mr Sudarsky's in the car getting gassy.

19:44.359 --> 19:47.549
- OK. Give me big smiles. Say "cheese".
- Cheese.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.630
- It's stuck.
- Honey, you always do this.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.710
I know. I...

19:53.279 --> 19:56.670
OK. This time for sure.

19:56.759 --> 19:58.950
- Say "cheese".
- Cheese.

19:59.039 --> 20:01.599
- That was great. OK.
- You kids get going.

20:01.680 --> 20:05.190
ALL right, now, listen.
You mo have a great time.

20:05.279 --> 20:07.579
we will.Bye
- b y e ,

20:24.440 --> 20:27.789
Tim, what you said upstairs
was very nice.

20:28.440 --> 20:31.910
Well. I was just trying
to remember my first dance.

20:38.279 --> 20:41.750
Wanna dance?
I promise I won't lead.

20:41.839 --> 20:44.630
Me either.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.670
ALL right.

20:53.279 --> 20:55.549
This isn't working.
Somebody's gotta lead.

20:55.640 --> 20:59.869
ALL right. Together, on three.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.069
One,

21:01.160 --> 21:02.269
mo.

21:02.359 --> 21:04.069
three.

21:06.119 --> 21:08.549
Oh, boy. Isn't this fun?

21:09.960 --> 21:12.150
ALL right, now I'll lead.

21:12.240 --> 21:14.619
- ALL right.
- It's a beautiful rhythm.

21:16.119 --> 21:19.150
Hands and tools. Hands and tools.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.829
Ever looked in the eyes
of a man who was building something

21:21.920 --> 21:26.069
like a bamboo fly rod, a mahogany boat,
or a billeted steel piece for a hot rod?

21:26.160 --> 21:29.829
Do you see aggression and destruction?
No, you see contentment.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.630
Hands and tools, hands and tools
can change the world.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.950
from building the smallest hobbyist train

21:35.039 --> 21:38.950
to the largest outboard-motor engines.
Look at this bad boy.

21:39.039 --> 21:41.789
Most of you see just
a hunk of metal. Not me.

21:41.880 --> 21:45.869
This is hundreds of parts working at high
rpm. 800 horsepower, tolerances of 1000.

21:45.960 --> 21:50.069
Machined by hand,
blueprinted and polished.

21:51.599 --> 21:54.349
But men aren't just into power and steel.

21:54.440 --> 21:58.190
Craftsmanship,
like this exquisite artwork here.

21:58.279 --> 22:00.430
Not Al, the panel.

22:01.799 --> 22:04.470
This antique Chinese privacy screen.

22:04.559 --> 22:07.230
on loan to us from
the Detroit Institute of Arts.

22:07.319 --> 22:12.339
is composed of intricate carvings...
I think 2.000 man-hours. Correct?

22:12.440 --> 22:15.390
2.000 man-hours. Imagine that.

22:15.480 --> 22:20.339
Intricacy beyond belief. Every delicate
little nuance is as delicate as crystal.

22:20.440 --> 22:24.710
Each piece is so delicate,
it could be snapped off just like that.

22:29.079 --> 22:33.509
Very often they made a few movable
pieces in these pieces...

22:34.920 --> 22:39.109
kind of like those little Chinese boxes
that you don't know how to open 'em.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.349
They're movable parts.

22:41.440 --> 22:44.549
Al, do you suppose this is movable,
this piece?

22:46.279 --> 22:48.430
I don't think so, Tim.

22:48.519 --> 22:50.670
Go get me that glue.

22:51.799 --> 22:55.190
What for? Are you gonna
glue it to your forehead?
