14:15.679 --> 14:17.338
Okay, first of all, the school board

14:17.339 --> 14:20.759
is making you read The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer, so...

14:21.339 --> 14:22.878
It's so basic.

14:22.879 --> 14:24.857
Yeah, that's the problem with

- I think Viv is homeless.

15:20.139 --> 15:22.548
She is shoveling food in her mouth

15:22.549 --> 15:24.678

dirty clothes in her backpack.

15:24.679 --> 15:26.928
Okay, well, a lot of girls
bring extra clothes to school.

15:26.929 --> 15:29.074
- She's just taking them home to wash...
- No. I was homeless, okay.

15:29.098 --> 15:32.215
Trust me. Something's going on,
here. You need to call child services.

story is with her dad,

15:34.404 --> 15:35.428
if there even is one.

15:35.429 --> 15:37.298
She could be in trouble.

15:37.299 --> 15:39.588

15:39.589 --> 15:42.338

really mess things up for them.

their real home lives are like.

15:50.549 --> 15:52.428

15:52.429 --> 15:54.088

15:54.089 --> 15:56.298
Should I go get a book and
figure it out for myself,

15:56.299 --> 15:58.758
or should I wait patiently
for your next lecture?

15:58.759 --> 15:59.907
Why you gotta get defensive?

15:59.932 --> 16:01.546

me when I am just...

16:03.259 --> 16:04.774

I can do to convince you of that.
