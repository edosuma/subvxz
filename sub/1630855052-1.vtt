09:16.510 --> 09:18.260
- It's my life.
- Oh, let's talk about her life.

09:18.460 --> 09:19.910
Let's talk about it.

09:20.110 --> 09:22.260
She told me that
she wanted to take a gap year.

09:22.460 --> 09:24.260
Now, do you know what that is?

09:24.460 --> 09:25.790
'Cause I damn sure didn't know.

09:25.990 --> 09:27.350
It's a year
where you don't do shit.

09:27.550 --> 09:29.270
SAM:
Oh, here we go again.

09:29.470 --> 09:30.840
- I was working on my music.
I was being productive. -Oh, no.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.970
Promised me that
she'd apply to colleges.

09:33.170 --> 09:35.100
Showed me
filled-out applications.

09:35.300 --> 09:36.410
She never turned them in.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.450
The devil's in the details.

09:38.650 --> 09:40.060
Oh, yeah,
and then she got arrested.

09:40.260 --> 09:42.020
- It was a misdemeanor.
- Oh, was it?

09:42.220 --> 09:44.460
How many times do I have to tell
you André is my music producer?

09:44.660 --> 09:45.940
Oh, so the studio got raided
for what, songs?

09:46.140 --> 09:47.630
What, do you think
that I'm stupid?

09:47.830 --> 09:49.110
Yes, I do.
It's written right there.

- [arguing]

09:50.840 --> 09:51.990

Why don't we just focus on
the positive here, all right?

09:58.060 --> 09:59.650
There's no positive here.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.520
- We've come up with a plan.
- LIZ: Mm-hmm.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.000
- You want to tell them, baby?
- Yeah, babe.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.740
Right, so you know
I work at Georgia State.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.920
Well, I called in a few favors,

10:09.120 --> 10:12.090
and they're willing to admit you
in the spring.

10:12.290 --> 10:13.830

10:17.210 --> 10:19.270
Well, [sighs] Sam,
just think about it.

10:19.470 --> 10:20.930
You'd be near Jess at Spelman.

10:21.130 --> 10:22.630
Maybe you two could even get
an apartment together.

10:22.830 --> 10:23.840
Oh, no.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.790
Jess could finally move out.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.590
Put some of her masterpieces
on her own walls.

10:29.790 --> 10:31.640
Painting is how I process grief

10:31.830 --> 10:34.060
from my beloved
departed cat Cheddar.

10:35.590 --> 10:36.940
Look, you are grown.

10:37.140 --> 10:38.560
And I can't force you to stay.

10:38.750 --> 10:40.430
Plus, I know you.

10:40.630 --> 10:43.340
You gonna get your money up
and do what you want to anyway.

10:43.540 --> 10:46.260
But I'm telling you, L.A. is not
for you right now, Sam.

10:46.460 --> 10:48.260
Guess what.

10:48.460 --> 10:50.740
You're not for me either.

10:50.940 --> 10:52.180
Yeah.

10:52.380 --> 10:54.140
- Sam, listen-- Sam.
- Goodbye.

10:54.340 --> 10:55.780
Whatever.

10:57.430 --> 10:59.010
Um, where's my room?

10:59.210 --> 11:01.700
It's upstairs. I'll show you.
[chuckles]

11:06.920 --> 11:08.760

11:08.960 --> 11:10.370

Sam, wait.

11:14.760 --> 11:17.860
Welcome, welcome, sister-cousin.

11:18.050 --> 11:19.680
This is my room,

11:19.880 --> 11:23.430
but I want you to think of it
as one communal safe space.

11:23.630 --> 11:24.850
Oh.

11:26.590 --> 11:27.780
[chuckles]

11:27.980 --> 11:31.780
And the best part is
we are connected.

11:31.980 --> 11:32.780

11:39.640 --> 11:42.230
I'm sort of
a multitalented artist.

11:42.430 --> 11:44.530
Drums aren't really my strength.

11:44.730 --> 11:47.540
So, this is your room.

So...

12:35.180 --> 12:37.940
I unpacked your stuff.

12:38.130 --> 12:40.370

all your clothes.

- Huh?

or do you write poetry or--

18:05.330 --> 18:06.180
And who's that?

18:06.380 --> 18:07.920
JESS:
Oh, that's Aaron.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.790
He used to be a big, you know,

18:09.990 --> 18:11.880
[whispers]: marijuana cigarette
dealer here in Atlanta.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.530
- Really?
- Then he suddenly

18:13.730 --> 18:16.970
and mysteriously stopped
and gave his life to the Lord.

18:17.170 --> 18:18.750
I'd leave that one alone.

18:18.950 --> 18:21.230
Melissa, the daughter
of our big donor,

18:21.430 --> 18:22.540
swears he's her soulmate.

18:22.740 --> 18:24.060
I'm not one to gossip,

18:24.260 --> 18:26.590
but she only came to this church
following him.

18:26.790 --> 18:28.150
I don't know what he put on her,

18:28.350 --> 18:31.510
but they call him Big Love
in the streets.

18:31.710 --> 18:32.640
Big Love, huh?

18:32.840 --> 18:34.330
- JESS: Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

18:34.530 --> 18:35.470
[gasps] That's her.

18:35.670 --> 18:39.080
Hey, sis. God bless. [chuckles]

18:39.280 --> 18:40.950
Hey, everyone.

18:41.150 --> 18:42.860
This is my cousin-sister Sam.

18:43.060 --> 18:44.690
She's from L.A.,
staying with me now.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.690
Sam, this is Jackie
and Jermaine.

BOTH:
Hi, Sam. Nice to meet you.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.920
[quietly]:
The twins are oddly close,

18:51.120 --> 18:52.870
- but they have a sixth sense.
- Hmm.

18:53.070 --> 18:54.610
And that's KiKi.

18:55.870 --> 18:58.450
KiKi! My cousin-sister Sam.

18:58.650 --> 19:00.800
Okay, dang, Jess, calm down.

19:03.780 --> 19:05.320
- What's up, Sam?
- Hmm.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.370
Welcome to our church.
Welcome to Atlanta.

Nice to meet you, Sam.
Have a seat. Have several.

19:26.280 --> 19:28.080
- Okay.
- I know that b...

19:28.280 --> 19:30.430
Don't worry about her.
Just come and sit down.

19:35.650 --> 19:38.000
Oh, I'm-a have a seat all right.

Can we make a joyful noise
in here, please?

- Yes.

19:45.950 --> 19:48.800

a-a number from our praise team,

19:54.400 --> 19:55.850
but we're excited.

is going to be performing

20:06.540 --> 20:08.390

championships again this year.

20:08.580 --> 20:10.040
[scattered applause]

20:10.240 --> 20:12.520
[chuckles] You guys
must've thought I lost faith

20:12.720 --> 20:14.000
after what happened last year.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.570
Not gonna lie.

20:15.770 --> 20:17.830
I was shook.

20:18.030 --> 20:19.870
But we're going back.

20:20.070 --> 20:21.180
We have to.

We can't let fear
have the victory.

And, Jess...

[chuckles softly]

20:37.180 --> 20:39.110
Thank you, Pastor.

20:39.310 --> 20:41.370
As team captain,
I am excited to lead

20:41.570 --> 20:44.120
and confident that God is going
to anoint my arrangements...

and I didn't want
to go out there,

26:38.890 --> 26:40.120
but he made me go out there
against my free will,

[PG grunts]

1:22:40.290 --> 1:22:42.090
Evidently,
the Promise Ringtones' church

1:22:42.290 --> 1:22:44.880
will not allow Kelly to sing,
and, uh,

1:22:45.080 --> 1:22:48.360
the rest of the Ringtones
will not compete without her.

1:22:48.560 --> 1:22:50.050
Wait, what happened?

1:22:51.050 --> 1:22:52.620
There's a tape.

1:22:52.820 --> 1:22:55.240
Uh, apparently Kelly and
one of the guys from church...

Oh, tea! A sex tape?

- KiKi.
- [stammers] You right, PG.

1:22:59.530 --> 1:23:03.200
I'm-a mind my own business,
but I'm-a start tomorrow.

1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:04.630
Thank you.

their church rules,

1:23:08.580 --> 1:23:12.080

to perform with the team.

1:23:15.890 --> 1:23:18.730
So, you have been invited
to nationals.

1:23:20.470 --> 1:23:22.260
Sam.

1:23:22.460 --> 1:23:24.830

1:23:25.030 --> 1:23:27.050
Yeah. Uh...

I'm sorry to hear about Kelly.

She was really nice to us.

So what do you think
about competing?

1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:38.150
You guys still want me
on the team?

- Duh. -Of course.
- Duh.

- What? -[laughter]
- [blows raspberry]

1:23:50.660 --> 1:23:53.030
Or the right one,
depending on how you look at it.

I stole a car that belonged
to a pastor, and I got caught.

In exchange for
not pressing charges,

- Oh, wow.
- Mm-hmm.

Now, that first Sunday was
my first time at church ever.

1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:11.660
But I knew that my life was
gonna change from that day on.

1:24:11.860 --> 1:24:14.050

♪ These are my confessions.

1:25:00.260 --> 1:25:02.060
First of all,
I can't judge Kelly

1:25:02.260 --> 1:25:06.020
because the footage that is
out there on me... whew!

1:25:06.220 --> 1:25:07.800
Damn.

1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:12.500
And I know God has covered
a pregnancy stick or two,

1:25:12.700 --> 1:25:14.640
- because when I say...
- Mm-hmm.

...your girl has been reckless,
she has been reckless.

1:25:17.620 --> 1:25:19.120
Come on, now.

And that night that
I blacked out off the D'USSEÉ

and the car got me home...

To this day,
I still don't know how.

But now I know it was you, God.
I know it. I feel it. I know it.

this wild faith in me.

1:25:41.990 --> 1:25:43.450
And in God, too.

how it all connects,

and how we love each other.
