No, but you can't do that.
You signed an NDA.

14:28.076 --> 14:31.037
And in that NDA, you handed
over rights to all ideas

14:31.037 --> 14:32.414
discussed at this dinner.

14:32.414 --> 14:33.707
[sighs] The hell?

14:33.707 --> 14:35.166
First rule of business:

14:35.166 --> 14:36.668
Don't let anyone
steal your ideas.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.211
- That's the first rule?
- Yes.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.170
Come on, man.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.505
Pleasure meeting you, Sherman.

14:40.505 --> 14:41.798
Sherman?

14:41.798 --> 14:43.633
Only my mama calls me Sherman.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.343
You're not my mama.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.265
Bro, where have you been?

14:50.265 --> 14:51.641
For a second there, we
thought you were skipping out.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.018
No, I'm good.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.436
There's this woman here
who's a speechwriter.

14:54.436 --> 14:55.895
I paid her for one
of her old speeches.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.188
Let me see it.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.527
- Have you read this?
- I skimmed it. Why?

15:02.527 --> 15:05.113
Because the first line is,
"As a strong Black woman."

15:05.113 --> 15:07.240
It's fine.
I'll make adjustments up there.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.992
You know, it's not too late
to just speak from your--

15:08.992 --> 15:10.869
Heart?
I'm good.

15:10.869 --> 15:12.328
This isn't a rom com.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.581
Yo.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.707
How was dinner with Zeb?

15:15.707 --> 15:17.375
- Zeb was trash.
- Really?

15:17.375 --> 15:19.044
They should be auctioning
off a dinner with you.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.420
How could that
possibly be true?

15:20.420 --> 15:22.047
Well, I signed an NDA,
so thankfully,

15:22.047 --> 15:23.923
I can't talk about it.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.593
[groaning]

15:26.593 --> 15:28.428
This tastes like spicy tires.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.721
- Give up?
- No.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.514
I never give up.
[retches]

15:31.514 --> 15:33.350
OK.
OK, that's enough.

15:33.350 --> 15:34.434
She's done.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.602
Sorry.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.020
I did not do good today.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.271
- Pay up.
- All right.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.565
- Give me my purse.
- Wait, Nicky, no.

15:40.565 --> 15:42.984
What?

15:42.984 --> 15:47.072
Look, I've lived in four
different countries.

15:47.072 --> 15:49.240
I've been married,
I've been divorced,

15:49.240 --> 15:51.910
I've lived in silence
in a Buddhist monastery.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.411
Wait, what?

15:53.411 --> 15:56.206
This bottle of wine is
not just any bottle of wine.

15:56.206 --> 15:58.249
It's a symbol of
our friendship.

15:58.249 --> 16:01.961
And I need it so that we can
drink it together

16:01.961 --> 16:04.172
before I, um--

16:05.465 --> 16:07.759
Nicky, I'm moving back
to New York.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.469
I didn't know how
or when to tell you,

16:09.469 --> 16:11.971
and I felt awful
lying to you all day.

16:14.307 --> 16:18.353
So please, if you can find it
in your heart to give us back

16:18.353 --> 16:20.814
this bottle, I want us
to drink it together

16:20.814 --> 16:23.191
before I leave Los Angeles.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.485
Just take it.
It's fine.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.655
Damn, girl.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.324
I taught you well.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.494
My God, that part about leaving
Los Angeles was so good.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.454
And those tears? Meryl who?

16:38.790 --> 16:39.958
Wait.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.084
You're not sweating.

16:41.084 --> 16:43.837
'Cause it's not a lie.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.213
I'm leaving.

16:51.011 --> 16:51.511
What time is it?

16:52.053 --> 16:53.972
all: Time to win!

16:53.972 --> 16:55.557
We had fun last year.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.684
But tonight's not about me.

16:57.684 --> 17:04.149
I am so excited to introduce
this year's Young Alumnus

17:04.149 --> 17:07.610
of the Year,
Mr. Anthony Holmes!

17:07.610 --> 17:11.197
- [cheers and applause]
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

17:15.744 --> 17:17.871
Thank you, Reggie.

17:21.207 --> 17:25.503
As a strong Black man,

17:25.503 --> 17:28.506
I am excited
to accept this award.

17:28.506 --> 17:31.926
To many people, I'm often seen
as nothing more than my full

17:31.926 --> 17:33.595
breasts and hips and my lips.

17:33.595 --> 17:34.679
- Oh, boy.
- Nope.

17:34.679 --> 17:36.473
- Oh, boy.
- Damn, damn,

17:43.063 --> 17:44.481
I'm sorry, y'all.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.232
I spent most of the
night stressing out,

17:46.232 --> 17:48.068
trying to figure out
the right words to say.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.446
But I think I should just
speak from the old ticker.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.739
He said it.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.532
Look, I'll be honest.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.951
I didn't think I deserved
this award because I was

17:56.951 --> 17:58.703
comparing myself to my peers.

17:58.703 --> 18:01.790
And I've been doing
that most of my life.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.626
You see, when you're young,

18:04.626 --> 18:08.338
success is just
an abstract destination.

18:08.338 --> 18:11.508
You work towards the future,
but it could be hard to tell

18:11.508 --> 18:13.385
when you've arrived.

18:13.385 --> 18:17.013
But luckily, you don't have
to figure it out on your own

18:17.013 --> 18:19.724
if you have the right people
around you.

18:19.724 --> 18:22.560
Look, I've done some things
that I am really proud of.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.896
I'm the first
Black Vice President

18:24.896 --> 18:26.356
- of Joseph & Philips.
- Hey, now.

18:26.356 --> 18:27.399
- Tell 'em.
- Yep.

18:27.399 --> 18:28.942
I started a mentorship program

18:28.942 --> 18:30.235
for Black and Brown kids

18:30.235 --> 18:31.653
to help with
financial literacy.

18:31.653 --> 18:34.239
And I hit a home run at
the company baseball game.

18:34.239 --> 18:36.574
You know he did, baby.
[laughter]

18:36.574 --> 18:38.660
No, wait, hold on,
I'm not playing.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.245
I mean, I whopped that thing.

18:40.245 --> 18:42.580
It's outta here!
[laughter]

18:42.580 --> 18:44.499
But seriously,

18:44.499 --> 18:48.586
I am incredibly grateful
for this honor.

18:48.586 --> 18:51.548
In a world where success is
just an abstract destination,

18:51.548 --> 18:54.134
it's nice to feel like
I finally arrived.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.428
[cheers and applause]

18:56.428 --> 18:58.972
Yay, yay!

19:00.348 --> 19:02.058
So wait, you're leaving?

19:02.058 --> 19:03.768
Like, for real, for real?

19:03.768 --> 19:05.311
For real, for real.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.771
Amir's opening up
a new bar in New York,

19:06.771 --> 19:08.273
and asked me to manage it.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.233
It just seems like
a really amazing opportunity.

19:10.233 --> 19:11.276
I mean, I guess
it makes sense.

19:11.276 --> 19:12.652
We sold all of your belongings.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.112
And now we know what
you and Amir were

19:14.112 --> 19:15.280
talking about the other day.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.115
I mean, I'm so
excited she said yes.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.950
I guess I could hop
on a plane for you.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.493
Oh, thanks.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.328
There'll always be
a spot on my couch for you.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.830
Couch?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.498
When I come, I want the bed.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.750
That's fair.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.793
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.545
[laughs]

19:32.380 --> 19:34.674
Oh, there he is,
the man of the hour.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.634
Yo, you killed that
speech, my guy.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.219
Yeah, man, once you got
past all that breast stuff,

19:38.219 --> 19:39.596
- you was rolling.
- For real.

19:39.596 --> 19:42.307
Thanks. Honestly, I could
not have done this

19:42.307 --> 19:44.017
- without y'all here with me.
- Like I said before,

19:44.017 --> 19:45.310
when one of us eats,
we all eat.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.853
Yay, yay!
all: Yay, yay!

19:46.853 --> 19:49.147
Well, look, the night's still
young, so shall we mingle?

19:49.147 --> 19:50.565
- Absolutely. Let's roll.
- Let's get it, yeah.

19:50.565 --> 19:51.983
- Yo, Sherm.
- Hey, I'ma catch up

19:51.983 --> 19:53.985
with y'all.
Hey. What's good, man?

19:53.985 --> 19:55.528
It was a crazy night.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.655
Hey, look, I'm sorry about
what happened with Zeb earlier.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.741
Ah, man, it's all good.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.701
I'll come up with new ideas.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.328
At least I got to
drink wine like I was

20:03.328 --> 20:06.414
- a part of the 1% tonight.
- [laughs] Yes, sir.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.667
Hey, look, I actually wanted
to talk to you about that.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.377
You got a great palate.

20:10.377 --> 20:11.836
You ever thought about
becoming a sommelier?

20:11.836 --> 20:13.546
- A sommelier?
- Yeah.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.507
Nah, man, I mean,
I love drinking wine,

20:15.507 --> 20:17.384
but I never thought
about going pro.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.344
Plus that world feels
a little stuffy for me, man.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.221
I'm a real grits and gravy
type of dude.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.389
I feel that.

20:22.389 --> 20:23.932
Well, look, you're a natural.

20:23.932 --> 20:28.103
So if you ever change
your mind, give me a call.

20:29.187 --> 20:30.271
