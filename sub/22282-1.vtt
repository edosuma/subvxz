SUSAN AIKENS: You know, it's
a beautiful time of year.

00:17.700 --> 00:20.833
And any excuse to get
Little Red out for a little...

00:20.967 --> 00:23.167
A buzz-buzz is kind of nice.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.433
I must stay profitable
to keep my lease,

00:28.500 --> 00:31.467
and I'm gonna have to open up
this winter to inundate myself

00:31.533 --> 00:34.200
with people to make up the
difference and be profitable.

00:36.467 --> 00:37.767
My name is Susan Aikens,

00:37.833 --> 00:40.667
and I am the sole resident
of Kavik River Camp,

00:40.733 --> 00:44.533
which is located 197 miles
north of the Arctic Circle.

00:45.167 --> 00:47.033
I am the only
refuelling station

00:47.100 --> 00:48.633
on the eastern side
of the North Slope.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.200
That's the size of a third
of the state of California.

00:51.300 --> 00:54.800
I bought the camp because
what I see is not an oil camp.

00:54.867 --> 00:56.867
What I see
is not a hunting camp.

00:56.933 --> 00:59.800
What I see is an ecotourism
camp and a place to visit

00:59.867 --> 01:02.033
this incredible place
we call the Arctic.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.067
You know,
when I was very little,

01:05.133 --> 01:07.633
people always ask you what you
wanna be when you grow up.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.167
And in the mid-'60s
for a girl,
it's supposed to be wife,

01:10.233 --> 01:12.600
mother, stewardess,
maybe even nurse.

01:13.067 --> 01:15.767
But I always had the same
answer, lighthouse keeper.

01:17.767 --> 01:20.900
I crave extreme isolation
and my personality thrives

01:20.967 --> 01:22.433
so that's how I'm living.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.367
I don't live by anybody
else's rules but my own.

01:26.933 --> 01:29.767
I've been hearing
the clients talk about

01:29.933 --> 01:32.767
a tonne of new bear scat
close in to camp.

01:33.167 --> 01:34.733
This is around where they say,

01:34.900 --> 01:37.533
I should start seeing where
they're digging things up

01:37.600 --> 01:39.033
and pooping all over.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.267
I've got one bear
out here that,

01:41.333 --> 01:43.167
for years I've called
a Monster Bear.

01:43.233 --> 01:44.833
He is 12 to 14 foot.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.667
Straight-up anomaly bear
for the inland grizzly.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.667
He's more like
a Kodiak bear size.

01:49.833 --> 01:51.933
The goal is to, er,

01:52.000 --> 01:54.633
maintain a secure perimeter
around camp.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.633
There's some.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.133
Oh, wow.

01:59.633 --> 02:02.200
Yeah, this is like,
totally really fresh.

02:03.267 --> 02:05.300
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

02:27.200 --> 02:29.667
Well, this is definitely
a nice little

02:30.367 --> 02:32.067
spring of dookie.

02:32.433 --> 02:34.200
Some of the things
you can tell,

02:34.500 --> 02:35.900
it's fresh

02:37.067 --> 02:39.400
and he's been eating
the berries.

02:39.633 --> 02:41.033
It's a juvenile bear.

02:41.167 --> 02:43.533
If you look at the size
of what's coming out,

02:44.067 --> 02:46.700
it's not that big
of, er, aperture.

02:48.367 --> 02:49.967
That bear has every right to
go be as happy

02:50.033 --> 02:51.600
as he wants to be
five miles out.

02:51.667 --> 02:52.833
One or two miles
close to camp,

02:52.900 --> 02:54.933
I'm gonna try
to persuade him to leave.

02:58.333 --> 03:00.833
You don't go
pushing the issue.

03:01.033 --> 03:02.900
You don't push
a confrontation.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.800
I think that's some ptarmigan.

03:07.867 --> 03:10.200
My food supply is getting a
little bit lower than I like.

03:10.267 --> 03:12.067
Ptarmigans are tasty
little meals.

03:12.133 --> 03:13.933
Maybe she doesn't see me.
Shit!

03:14.000 --> 03:15.567
She's getting ready to fly.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.900
I got a little ptarmy.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.633
Damn, there's a ton of them.

03:43.967 --> 03:45.767
(GUNSHOT)

03:53.100 --> 03:54.100
(GUNSHOT)

03:59.400 --> 04:00.967
(GUNSHOT)

04:08.300 --> 04:09.833
I got two here.

04:11.767 --> 04:13.500
The original mission

04:14.400 --> 04:16.133
was to check for predators.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.800
That was worth it though.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.300
I got some birdies.

04:20.367 --> 04:23.433
Just a nice little addition
for my food supply.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.533
And I've got a tasty
little meal for dinner.

04:26.933 --> 04:30.033
Today I found out about
the animals in my area.

04:31.133 --> 04:33.267
Right now I'm seeing
bear activity.

04:33.967 --> 04:36.033
I need to take notice.
I need to pay attention.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.133
Until it gets within a mile,
half-mile of camp,

04:38.200 --> 04:39.667
I don't need to worry.

04:39.967 --> 04:41.533
But I need to be aware.

JESSIE HOLMES:
I'm a man building a lifestyle

04:50.367 --> 04:52.100
and a life out here
for myself.

05:07.533 --> 05:09.833
Bailing the old wood boat
out here.

05:10.067 --> 05:13.533
It's been raining for a week,
and this thing

05:13.767 --> 05:15.300
has taken on a lot of water

05:15.367 --> 05:17.467
in the last few days
of heavy rain.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.600
I've got so much to do I can
hardly keep up

05:22.667 --> 05:23.900
on everything, you know?

05:28.733 --> 05:31.400
My name is Jessie Holmes,
I live in Nenana, Alaska

05:31.467 --> 05:33.567
with my team of 55 sled dogs.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.733
I love dogs,
I love the loyalty

05:37.800 --> 05:40.567
and the work ethic
of the Alaskan husky.

05:40.633 --> 05:43.133
I appreciate their tough
feats, their big hearts,

05:43.200 --> 05:44.733
and their athleticism.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.567
I build my own structures,
I hunt, I fish,

05:47.633 --> 05:49.433
I live
a subsistence lifestyle.

05:50.500 --> 05:51.967
I made a lot of mistakes
in my life

05:52.033 --> 05:55.100
and I fucked up a lot, and I'm
trying to like make up for it.

05:55.433 --> 05:57.400
That's what I would
tell you about me.

06:02.100 --> 06:05.567
It's gonna continue to rain
and it's gonna get cold.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.233
Perfect for moose hunting.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.533
If I get a moose,
it saves me a lot of time,

06:10.600 --> 06:13.200
because one shot at getting
hundreds of pounds of meat

06:13.267 --> 06:16.300
as opposed to killing
a hundred critters

06:16.367 --> 06:18.300
to get by during the winter,
you know?

06:18.533 --> 06:21.167
(ENGINE ROARING)

06:21.233 --> 06:23.867
Well, I'm here in the main
channel of the big river,

06:23.933 --> 06:26.267
and I'm about to dip
into a slough back here.

06:27.300 --> 06:28.367
Head a few miles up,

06:28.433 --> 06:30.567
and try to find a meadow
to hunt tonight.

06:30.667 --> 06:33.100
My plan's to get out there and
set up a little camp,

06:33.167 --> 06:35.933
and then head down to a meadow
and call moose in.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.100
See if I get any response.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.633
You always gotta keep
your eyes open

06:41.700 --> 06:43.467
when you're out here,
because you never know

06:43.567 --> 06:45.133
when a moose is gonna come.

06:48.667 --> 06:50.500
I'm gonna set up camp now.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.533
I'm gonna rig up
a tarp here so,

06:54.600 --> 06:56.133
got a place to get out
of the rain,

06:56.200 --> 06:57.567
stay dry tonight.

06:57.633 --> 07:01.367
Keep it simple, man, it just
keeps it more peaceful to me.

07:01.433 --> 07:03.267
Five-star accommodations.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.133
Get this done, now I can head
on out and hunt.

07:14.467 --> 07:15.733
It's getting late.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.533
I'm hoping that this
will be productive,

07:17.600 --> 07:20.167
but the only way to find out
is to go get quiet

07:20.233 --> 07:21.767
and start calling moose.

07:22.667 --> 07:24.667
My moose-call here is the
moose shoulder blade

07:24.733 --> 07:26.867
I scrape and use
to call the moose in.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.867
I'm looking for like,
some sign of moose activity.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.467
(WHISPERING)
I see a lot of spots
where a moose bed down,

07:41.533 --> 07:44.000
so this is a meadow
that moose come to.

08:07.567 --> 08:09.067
I can't reliably

08:09.667 --> 08:12.367
even see for a good shot, so,

08:13.067 --> 08:15.400
gonna head on,
come back in the morning.

08:15.467 --> 08:17.233
But good start.

EDWARD HAILSTONE:
Boating. Hunting.

08:26.233 --> 08:27.667
Fishing, camping.

08:27.733 --> 08:29.300
I wouldn't trade this life
for anything.

-Wonder what we got.

I'm married, I've got five
daughters, couple sons.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.000
We live here
in Noorvik, Alaska

08:51.067 --> 08:52.433
for a good chunk of the year,
then I live in camps

08:52.500 --> 08:55.167
for probably good seven,
eight months of the year.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.033
And, er, we all work together

08:57.100 --> 08:58.600
and we like to show our kids
what to do.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.167
And if our kids
choose to live this way,

09:00.233 --> 09:01.333
they've got
good knowledge in it,

09:01.400 --> 09:02.467
and if they don't choose
to live this way,

09:02.533 --> 09:04.500
they're well-versed
in other stuff.

and we hunt, fish,

09:13.500 --> 09:15.767
and gather pretty much
year-round.

a subsistence lifestyle.

09:23.567 --> 09:24.900
What is that?

09:24.967 --> 09:27.467

from your mom and your dad.

AGNES HAILSTONE:
I've acquired some property.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.867
It was passed down to me
from my mother,

09:31.933 --> 09:34.333

to some lands

09:44.900 --> 09:46.267

she had inherited,

years for the courts

from Selawick,

09:57.133 --> 09:58.533
and we'll take him down
to Emonakrov,

09:58.600 --> 09:59.933
that's the name
of the camp down there,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.200
have him pick out a place and
he can give me a hand

10:02.267 --> 10:04.400
and maybe start developing
a taste for the area.

of the river.

We own both sides.

The Hailstones' new land
allows greater access

10:19.700 --> 10:21.533
to resources for survival,

10:22.067 --> 10:23.833
but with the onslaught
of winter storms

10:23.900 --> 10:26.500
and freezing temperatures
rapidly approaching,

10:26.700 --> 10:29.133
building a permanent
structure is a priority.

10:30.467 --> 10:32.400
My legs are too short
for this!

10:32.467 --> 10:34.600
(LAUGHING)

10:35.000 --> 10:36.933
This is my train of thought.

10:37.733 --> 10:39.233
Everybody that was here didn't
come here to play

10:39.300 --> 10:41.833
in the willows,
they came here to fish.

10:42.667 --> 10:43.933
So, they're definitely gonna
put a place where,

10:44.000 --> 10:45.700
they could park their boat or
find it easy

10:45.767 --> 10:47.667
with a dog team
or snow machine.

10:48.267 --> 10:50.533
So my thought is they
can't get in with a boat,

10:50.900 --> 10:52.100
I'm gonna stick with the creek
and go find

10:52.167 --> 10:53.567
a camping spot along it.

10:57.900 --> 10:59.333
Look at that, tent pegs.

10:59.900 --> 11:02.333
Somebody tented here, until
the bush grew through it.

11:03.167 --> 11:04.433
-Yeah, this is the place...
-Yup, look.

11:04.500 --> 11:05.633
-Tent's peg, look at that.
-...we were talking about.

11:05.700 --> 11:08.733
Whoopa-whoopa-whoopa, hot dog.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.400
This'll be the place, and now
we can knock that off

11:10.467 --> 11:12.733
with a chainsaw real easy,
open this up a little bit.

11:13.433 --> 11:15.300
Look how flat and level
this ground is.

11:15.367 --> 11:16.733
This is just wonderful.

11:16.967 --> 11:19.300
We're gonna take the cue of
my wife's grandparents,

11:19.667 --> 11:21.200
and we're gonna use this spot

11:21.633 --> 11:23.933
to develop, instead of having
just a tent on the ground

11:24.000 --> 11:25.233
like those folks used to do,

11:25.300 --> 11:26.533
we're gonna put something
a little more permanent.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.667
We're gonna put
some posts down

11:27.733 --> 11:29.167
and we're gonna put
some crossbeams.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.867
We gotta start with something,
I can't start with a house.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.367
Can't just land a house here
or have it parachuted in.

11:34.667 --> 11:35.767
We gotta start with
a little bit of shelter,

11:35.833 --> 11:37.600
and then we can build
from there.

I had to figure things out.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.833
I had to learn things,
it takes time.

11:45.900 --> 11:47.333
In my case, it took years.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.500

here for a week

11:56.567 --> 11:59.167
just waiting to get out
of town. It's crummy weather.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.900

to the Brooks Range

12:08.867 --> 12:10.133
for dark winter.

12:12.133 --> 12:13.900
Bad weather has him stranded,

12:14.133 --> 12:15.933
and a break in the storm is
his only chance

12:16.000 --> 12:17.167
to return home.

12:17.433 --> 12:19.300
I gotta get a float plane here
and get up to the lake.

12:19.367 --> 12:21.267
It's 200 miles north
of Fairbanks,

12:21.967 --> 12:24.367
and between here and there,
there's a bunch of mountains.

12:24.467 --> 12:26.300
Here's the airport right here,
oh, my gosh!

12:26.367 --> 12:27.767
Look at the clouds.

12:28.167 --> 12:29.933
Right down to those hills.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.267
That's not good.

12:32.467 --> 12:34.833
But the pilot thought that
we might be able to make it.

12:34.900 --> 12:36.400
We're gonna give it
a try anyway.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.933
It doesn't look very good.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.633
-Morning, Myles.
-Morning.

12:45.733 --> 12:47.033
Any chance of getting
up there today?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.367
I think there's a chance.

12:48.433 --> 12:49.900
We'll give it a try.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.567
GLENN: I used
to live in Vermont.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.033
And I used to like being out
in the woods a lot,

12:54.100 --> 12:56.167
ever since I was little, so
when I got to thinking about

12:56.233 --> 12:57.900
where I wanted to live
the rest of my life,

12:57.967 --> 13:00.167
I was looking at a map
and I thought, "Hey,

13:00.367 --> 13:02.667
"Alaska, that looks like
a good place to go."

13:05.300 --> 13:08.067
Even if there's only a small
chance of getting up there,

13:08.133 --> 13:10.533
I wanna get up there so bad
I'd like to try it.

13:10.667 --> 13:12.800
To fly a small plane,
you gotta be able to see
where you're going.

13:12.867 --> 13:14.667
We can't fly
on instruments, so,

13:15.000 --> 13:16.867
if we can't see where we're
going, we can't get there.

13:16.933 --> 13:18.500
On a clear day,
you can see mountains

13:18.567 --> 13:21.100
all across the horizon down
there, big mountains.

13:22.867 --> 13:24.600
Can't see anything
down there now.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.167
What about just getting over
to the flats though?

13:26.233 --> 13:27.400
That might be
a little tricky too.

13:27.467 --> 13:28.600
Yeah.

13:45.933 --> 13:48.300
GLENN: It's time
for me to get headed
back to the Brooks Range.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.400
It's about a 60-mile walk
from the nearest road,

13:51.467 --> 13:53.467
200 miles from town.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.133
I live out here 'cause I just
feel really well living out
in the mountains like this.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.233
This is my favourite place
in the world.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.900
There's this veneer
of civilisation

14:05.967 --> 14:07.700
that's weighing people down,

14:07.867 --> 14:09.967
and there's something inside
waiting to get out

14:10.033 --> 14:12.667
and you get out here in the
woods and you can live it.

14:14.933 --> 14:17.233
You can get as primal
as you wanna get.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.233
It's different out here.

14:24.433 --> 14:26.433

MYLES: We're here.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.733

14:28.800 --> 14:31.367
Looks like I went straight
from fall to winter.

-There you are.
-Okay, Myles.

14:35.367 --> 14:36.800

-Okay, Glenn, sure.

15:14.633 --> 15:17.133
Found a meadow, but I didn't
see a lot of sign there

15:17.200 --> 15:19.533
so now I'm gonna try
to find another meadow.

15:19.633 --> 15:20.867

from nearby predators,

15:40.433 --> 15:42.533
finding a moose won't be easy.

Wow, that's a bear den
right there.

16:02.900 --> 16:05.033
Doesn't look like
it's habituated now,

16:05.100 --> 16:07.933
but come time winter comes
a bear's gonna come

16:08.000 --> 16:10.067
and crawl in here
and den up here.

16:10.233 --> 16:12.400
This is definitely
bear country out here.

16:12.700 --> 16:13.900
If I found a bear,

16:13.967 --> 16:15.267
I would definitely go for it,

16:15.333 --> 16:16.900

right here

16:30.100 --> 16:31.833

16:32.433 --> 16:34.067
Definitely found a place where
the moose

16:34.133 --> 16:35.800
are active, you know.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.033
You can get a moose by luck,

The Hailstones plan to develop

wood and build a foundation

is basically,

18:27.433 --> 18:28.633
what we call "river logs".

of their branches.

18:33.033 --> 18:34.233
They've been tumbled.

18:34.300 --> 18:35.567
Maybe they've gone through
a couple breakups

18:35.633 --> 18:36.967

had at them.

They're stripped of branches.

they get buried in the snow
and I can't utilise them,

for standing dead timber.

22:58.933 --> 23:00.533

something else.

24:00.567 --> 24:02.367
It's gonna cook my food,
it's gonna heat my cabin,

24:02.433 --> 24:04.000
it's gonna heat my hot water.

24:09.533 --> 24:10.733
Got my wood.

24:11.933 --> 24:13.167
Mission accomplished.

24:17.333 --> 24:20.400
SUE: Just feeling
happy that I'm
in the middle of nature.

24:33.033 --> 24:35.933
I gotta get the Argo, bring it
around to the other shed,

24:36.000 --> 24:37.433
and then I'll get the, er,

24:37.933 --> 24:38.933
sled out.

24:39.767 --> 24:41.933
NARRATOR:
With hunting clients
staying at Kavik,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.367
Sue must remove
the carcasses of their kill.

24:44.433 --> 24:45.800
If not done immediately,

24:45.867 --> 24:48.367
hungry predators may breach
the camp's perimeter

24:48.433 --> 24:51.300
and threaten the safety
of herself and her guests.

24:51.367 --> 24:52.867
People come,
they'll hang their meat.

24:52.933 --> 24:55.367
Age it, whatever,
wait till they can work on it.

24:55.433 --> 24:57.433
But as soon as you can,
you get it out,

24:57.500 --> 25:00.633
and the state tells me how far
I need to go and dump it.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.067
And, er, that's what
I'm doing now.

25:03.967 --> 25:06.633
This is what bears and
predators eat

25:06.767 --> 25:08.367
to get their fat for winter.

25:09.067 --> 25:11.800
I don't want them to come
through my building to get it.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.933
The goal is to get
this out of camp,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.400
so the predators don't see
Sue's Diner

25:16.467 --> 25:18.233
written on the side
of my tents.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.467
The grizzlies are the ones

25:20.533 --> 25:22.300
that I'm most concerned
about here.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.967
One's called Monster Bear.

25:24.233 --> 25:26.967
The first time I saw him,
he dwarfed the trailer.

25:27.033 --> 25:29.167
All's I did was get up
and out of his way.

25:29.233 --> 25:31.033
Whatever he wanted
he could take.

25:33.967 --> 25:36.433
So I just want to see what
the river looks...

25:38.967 --> 25:40.533
There's bear prints there.

25:42.367 --> 25:44.767
We'll get out and take a
look-see at what kind

25:44.833 --> 25:47.900
of prints we have
going on here.

25:47.967 --> 25:51.000
You really want to see what's
running around your turf.

25:51.067 --> 25:53.167
Start checking out the mud.

25:53.433 --> 25:55.133
Yeah, pad

25:55.200 --> 25:56.533
and claws.

25:57.867 --> 25:59.900
Pad, claws.

26:00.433 --> 26:01.800
Not Monster Bear.

26:03.100 --> 26:04.633
Sometimes,

26:04.900 --> 26:06.633
it's the smaller bears

26:06.733 --> 26:09.367
that are more of a threat
than the bigger bears.

26:15.033 --> 26:16.200
What is that?

26:16.767 --> 26:19.000
About a mile, mile and a half
out that way,

26:19.400 --> 26:21.133
I can't tell you what I see.

26:22.767 --> 26:24.033
There's a moose.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.733
I cannot shoot a moose.

26:27.100 --> 26:29.500
Go back a couple of years,
they shut down the hunting.

26:29.567 --> 26:31.100
Probably never to reopen it.

26:31.700 --> 26:34.067
But damn is that
a happy fucking sight.

26:34.133 --> 26:35.600
Here's a bull moose,

26:35.667 --> 26:37.467
in his prime, looking awesome.

26:37.533 --> 26:40.167
Probably made out
with the girl down the road.

26:40.233 --> 26:41.500
Procreating.

26:41.700 --> 26:44.500
And here he is just strutting
his stuff looking awesome.

26:45.300 --> 26:46.967
All right, time to go.

26:48.300 --> 26:50.367
I got a little marshy
area here.

26:50.467 --> 26:52.833
I got to be able to dump off
the bones

26:53.600 --> 26:55.333
far enough away from camp.

26:57.633 --> 26:59.467
(ENGINE STOPS)

27:02.000 --> 27:03.800
Okay, make sure that's secure.

27:03.967 --> 27:05.533
You want that close by.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.600
And then I'm just gonna take
this and,

27:08.667 --> 27:10.600
get rid of it. (GRUNTS)

27:16.033 --> 27:17.633
(THUDS)

27:33.900 --> 27:36.133
All right. (GRUNTS)

27:36.233 --> 27:38.833
I'm just gonna take
your little hoof.

27:39.933 --> 27:42.133
You use what's around ya.

27:45.033 --> 27:46.833
This is antibacterial,

27:46.900 --> 27:48.967
and, er, antimicrobial.

27:50.100 --> 27:53.200
And I'm just trying to get
some of the skunky blood off.

27:53.500 --> 27:54.800
We'll just clean it up.

27:55.367 --> 27:56.467
Here we go.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.967
The predators have
what they need.

28:01.033 --> 28:03.233
I have what I need. (SNIFFS)

28:03.300 --> 28:04.733
Time to get back home.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.333
CHIP: I don't want to sit at
the house and do nothing.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.100
I don't want to be stuck in
some camp doing nothing.

28:12.167 --> 28:14.533
There's so much to do
out here, it's crazy.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.133
All we gotta do
is dig holes and,

28:22.200 --> 28:25.800
put those posts in and put the
three top pieces, huh?

28:25.867 --> 28:27.200
NARRATOR:
The Hailstones have returned

28:27.267 --> 28:29.000
to their recently
inherited property.

28:29.067 --> 28:31.967
Chip, Agnes, and Jon will
begin building a foundation

28:32.033 --> 28:34.633
for a structure that will
allow the family to maximise

28:34.700 --> 28:36.633
the resources
at their new grounds.

28:36.700 --> 28:38.400
CHIP: I'm gonna eventually
have a camp here.

28:38.467 --> 28:39.733
Just have to start
with something and, er,

28:39.800 --> 28:42.300
this is gonna be the
foundation of our something.

28:45.833 --> 28:49.900
AGNES: Emonakrov is a pretty
good place to go fishing.

28:49.967 --> 28:52.233
It's a pretty good place
to go birding.

28:54.133 --> 28:57.067
Even if it didn't really have
anything, just you know,

28:57.133 --> 28:58.867
having it from my mother

28:58.933 --> 29:01.267
and grandmother
is pretty good with me.

29:02.933 --> 29:04.600
CHIP: That post is all the
way down.

29:04.667 --> 29:06.800
It's about two and a half feet
in the ground.

29:06.933 --> 29:08.267
Couple of them are irregular,

29:08.333 --> 29:09.933
and I don't know how deep
each hole is gonna be,

29:10.000 --> 29:11.633
so the best thing to do is put
the posts in first

29:11.700 --> 29:13.267
and then we'll trim them to
the size we want them,

29:13.333 --> 29:14.967
which is gonna be
about two feet up.

29:35.167 --> 29:36.867
We're gonna put
the crosspieces, gables,

29:36.933 --> 29:38.533
and the flooring later.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.533
We're just doing a foundation
today, nothing more.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.267
And this is an excellent one.

29:44.733 --> 29:46.133
-Cool, huh?
-Yeah.

29:46.200 --> 29:49.367
Water will flow under here,
snow can blow under here.

29:49.733 --> 29:51.367
We'll be good up top here.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.633
We better just call it
a day now.

29:53.700 --> 29:55.667
I think there's not much more
we can do here anyway.

29:55.733 --> 29:57.400
AGNES: Ready?
CHIP: Yep, ready.

29:58.300 --> 30:00.633
We'll bring the girls back
and let them see
what we've done, huh.

30:00.700 --> 30:03.267
This is awesome.
Something we can come down
here and stay here

30:03.333 --> 30:05.633
when we work instead
of driving back home.

30:13.467 --> 30:16.033
JESSIE: Nature pretty
much provides
everything you need,

30:16.100 --> 30:18.633
you just have to learn
the skills, and adapt to it.

30:25.033 --> 30:28.200
NARRATOR:
Jessie Holmes is hunting moose
along the Nenana River.

30:28.267 --> 30:29.300
But this time of year,

30:29.367 --> 30:31.467
he can only legally hunt
bull moose.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.433
With hunting season
coming to an end,

30:33.500 --> 30:36.167
Jessie must wait patiently
for a chance at the animal.

30:37.400 --> 30:40.367
JESSIE: Moose-hunting
season ends
at midnight tonight.

30:40.767 --> 30:42.900
I need to get one
before it gets dark.

30:44.600 --> 30:45.933
You gotta be patient,

30:46.000 --> 30:48.733
for moose hunting, but you
also gotta be persistent.

30:49.333 --> 30:50.333
(GRASS RUSTLING)

30:54.333 --> 30:55.533
There's a cow.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.367
Cow and a calf, so,

31:16.667 --> 31:18.867
where there's a cow,
usually there's a bull.

31:18.933 --> 31:20.700
I think it's the same one
I saw last night.

31:20.767 --> 31:23.067
There was a bull travelling
with her, so...

31:23.400 --> 31:24.867
Hopefully he's around
here somewhere.

31:24.933 --> 31:26.933
I haven't heard him
anywhere though.

31:39.300 --> 31:42.000
She might not be in heat.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.933
There's a slough up
around this bend

31:44.000 --> 31:46.233
that goes and cuts in here.

31:46.300 --> 31:47.600
I'm gonna go check it out,

31:47.667 --> 31:49.800
see if there's another
entrance to this meadow

31:49.867 --> 31:51.467
and check it out over there.

31:58.367 --> 32:00.033
This is the whole thicket
in between

32:00.100 --> 32:01.333
the moose and the slough,

32:01.400 --> 32:03.800
so they're travelling
through this area.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.033
I just gotta keep trying.

32:06.100 --> 32:07.567
I gotta get some meat,
you know?

32:07.767 --> 32:09.100
This is my opportunity.

32:14.333 --> 32:17.033
I'm gonna go and check
this side of the scene out.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.933
When I've gotten a moose
in the past,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I feel like it's more out
of luck than skill,

32:24.067 --> 32:25.433
so coming out here,

32:25.500 --> 32:28.167
moose hunting is a real
opportunity for me to build

32:28.233 --> 32:29.967
a skill that's gonna be a

32:30.033 --> 32:32.733
very good life skill
to have in Alaska.

32:32.933 --> 32:34.367
(WHISPERS) There's
more fresh shit.

32:49.267 --> 32:51.200
Just can't see nothing.

32:52.233 --> 32:53.467
Damn it.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.667
It's kind of a bummer
to not get a moose,

32:57.733 --> 33:00.533
but, you know, I'm not angry
or I'm not like discouraged.

33:00.600 --> 33:02.567
Like, I'm not gonna like,
stop trying.

33:02.633 --> 33:05.267
I'm gonna continue to come
out here in this land,

33:05.333 --> 33:07.833
and develop an intimate
relationship with it.

33:08.467 --> 33:10.300
That doesn't all
happen overnight.

33:15.800 --> 33:16.967
Some grouse.

33:17.900 --> 33:19.233
There's some grouse!

33:24.033 --> 33:25.867
(GUNSHOT)

33:31.333 --> 33:32.767
Got him, right in the neck.

33:36.367 --> 33:39.200
Man, nice breast there,
not damaged.

33:43.900 --> 33:46.167
I'm just, er, filleting out
the breast meat here,

33:46.300 --> 33:48.100
the prime part of the grouse.

33:52.067 --> 33:54.200
I realised there was no moose
where I was at,

33:54.267 --> 33:56.967
so figured I may as well not
come home empty-handed.

34:01.567 --> 34:03.433
Look at that good
fat on there.

34:06.033 --> 34:08.400
I'm, er, really into hunting
small game, you know?

34:08.467 --> 34:10.633
Like I've always
really enjoyed it,

34:10.700 --> 34:13.700
and always considered myself
to be pretty good at

34:13.867 --> 34:15.767
hunting the small game,
you know?

34:16.367 --> 34:18.567
This is where they process
their stomach,

34:18.633 --> 34:20.533
and they have to eat rocks
and gravel.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.900
This is one of my favourite
parts right here.

34:22.967 --> 34:24.200
It's like, I think last year,

34:24.267 --> 34:26.267
I probably killed
about 30 grouse.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.533
Because, bam!
One grouse, one meal.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.867
Simple guy like me who only
needs one meal a day,

34:30.933 --> 34:33.167
you know?
Like, goes a long way.

34:33.833 --> 34:35.633
Well, no moose yet,
but at least

34:35.700 --> 34:37.333
I got something to eat here.

34:38.233 --> 34:41.167
Now I can go back and have
myself a delicious breakfast.

34:47.567 --> 34:50.033
Still got some embers going
to this fire and I

34:50.600 --> 34:52.600
have a fresh grouse
to cook up.

34:53.100 --> 34:54.800
Just got back
from hunting this morning.

34:54.867 --> 34:56.967
Little bit of action,
saw a cow and a calf.

34:57.033 --> 34:58.333
No bull came out.

34:59.700 --> 35:00.900
Saw a grouse,

35:00.967 --> 35:03.033
I figured may as well take
this opportunity.

35:04.167 --> 35:06.100
Best to always be ready
for something like that,

35:06.167 --> 35:08.100
because it just pops up
really quick.

35:09.100 --> 35:10.100
(INHALES DEEPLY)

35:11.233 --> 35:13.433
Nothing more pleasurable than
being out here camping,

35:13.500 --> 35:14.633
and like eating food
that's like,

35:14.700 --> 35:15.967
actually come from the land,
you know,

35:16.033 --> 35:17.767
I don't wanna come out here
with MREs

35:17.833 --> 35:20.300
like a lot of guys do.
That's disgusting to me.

35:21.600 --> 35:22.633
Go.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.200
Whole reason I'm out here
trying to get a moose

35:30.267 --> 35:32.133
is because I enjoy
eating like

35:32.200 --> 35:33.900
natural food that comes
from the land.

35:33.967 --> 35:35.500
That's part of my lifestyle.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.967
I'm just gonna let this
cook here

35:38.167 --> 35:39.167
in this water.

35:40.433 --> 35:42.067
That way I'll have myself
a nice broth

35:42.133 --> 35:43.467
for my boat trip home.

35:45.433 --> 35:47.300
I didn't get a moose,
but what I did

35:47.367 --> 35:49.333
is invested in my knowledge
of the country

35:49.400 --> 35:51.433
and knowledge of the
moose's characteristics,

35:51.500 --> 35:53.000
and how to better hunt them
in the future,

35:53.067 --> 35:54.967
and I feel like I learned
a lot, you know?

35:55.067 --> 35:56.667
It's hard not to learn
a lot, I mean,

35:56.733 --> 35:59.000
your eyes are closed
if you're not learning.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.600
Not getting a moose
just means like,

36:02.667 --> 36:04.100
I'm gonna have to snare
a lot of rabbits,

36:04.167 --> 36:05.700
shoot a lot of grouse,

36:05.933 --> 36:07.067
and eat a lot
of fish this winter.

36:07.133 --> 36:08.367
That's all right
with me though.

36:08.433 --> 36:11.000
I appreciate any food that
comes from the land.

36:13.733 --> 36:15.300
You can't lose out here.

36:15.633 --> 36:17.300
This is a lifestyle
that's like a blessing

36:17.367 --> 36:18.567
to be able to live.

36:24.067 --> 36:25.533
CHIP: I work for myself
and I work for my family.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.600
I work for my wife,
I work for my kids.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.633
CHIP: This is pretty
cool, huh? All this snow.

36:36.133 --> 36:38.167
(LAUGHING)

36:38.633 --> 36:40.533
AGNES: Careful with that
chainsaw, son.

36:40.967 --> 36:44.467
CHIP: Oh, what a day.
Look, it's snowing like
crazy across the river.

36:45.033 --> 36:47.633
You girls are gonna like what
we've cleared out down there.

36:47.967 --> 36:50.567
You'll like the different
little places that we made.

36:50.633 --> 36:53.100
AGNES: Today is the first day
of winter, so, erm,

36:53.167 --> 36:56.267
we have a couple inches
of snow overnight, and, er,

36:56.567 --> 37:00.033
it's kind of put a thin layer
of ice all over everything.

37:00.567 --> 37:02.367
Crazy how the weather
changes, eh?

37:02.433 --> 37:03.833
-AGNES: Yeah!
-(LAUGHING)

37:04.367 --> 37:07.633
I love it! Winter's arriving,
it's knocking on the door.

37:07.733 --> 37:09.500
It's saying, "Get
your shit together."

37:09.867 --> 37:11.500
(LAUGHING)

37:12.733 --> 37:14.000
We're heading downriver,
all right.

37:14.067 --> 37:15.867
We're gonna go down
to Emonakrov and, erm,

37:15.933 --> 37:18.100
we're going to show the girls
the progress we've made,

37:18.167 --> 37:19.600
me and Jon and Agnes.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.633
CHIP: You guys make
yourselves comfortable.

37:25.933 --> 37:28.467
I want these girls to know
that this is gonna be there,

37:28.533 --> 37:30.433
and where it is, and start
to familiarize themselves

37:30.500 --> 37:31.700
with the territory
around there,

37:31.767 --> 37:34.100
so that even in the winter,
they'll find it.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.800
You girls will like it.
Keep watching these
channels so you'll learn

37:36.867 --> 37:38.033
your way down here.

37:38.100 --> 37:39.767
In the springtime when
we're sheefishing,

37:39.833 --> 37:41.467
we'll come down here lots.

37:41.533 --> 37:43.400
The snow's kind of getting
wet now, huh?

37:43.467 --> 37:45.700
-It's almost turning to rain.
-Yeah.

37:46.400 --> 37:49.033
We're gonna be doing pretty
good down here I think.

37:50.867 --> 37:52.033
Oh! A seal ahead of us!

37:54.800 --> 37:55.833
There he is.

37:56.333 --> 37:57.700
Oh, he's a big one.

38:00.133 --> 38:01.333
See him right there?

38:01.400 --> 38:02.600
Coming at us?

38:12.200 --> 38:14.233
I think we're not
gonna get any closer.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.833
(CHIP SPEAKING)

38:19.733 --> 38:21.800
We're almost there,
let's keep going in.

38:26.967 --> 38:28.500
There you go, kiddos.

38:31.367 --> 38:32.867
(LAUGHING)

38:33.933 --> 38:35.667
So what you girls
think of this?

38:36.767 --> 38:38.067
AGNES: Nice spot, eh?

38:38.433 --> 38:40.667
This right here
is the start of,
what we're gonna do.

38:40.733 --> 38:41.933
And I want to get
a tent in here,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.167
and then once we got a tent,
we can start working on

38:44.333 --> 38:46.267
bigger projects
like a log cabin,

38:46.367 --> 38:48.533
tower, caches,
things like that.

38:48.600 --> 38:51.067
AGNES: I've been fishing
down here lots with my mom.

38:51.167 --> 38:53.733
I'm sure she was fishing
down here with her mom.

38:53.800 --> 38:56.467
Now you girls get to come down
here and go fish with me.

38:56.833 --> 38:58.067
-Pretty cool, huh?
-Yeah.

38:58.967 --> 39:00.833
We'll eat a little something
before we head home.

39:00.900 --> 39:03.367
We're way far away
from help. Whoo!

39:03.433 --> 39:06.200
Even though it's snowing,
it's a beautiful day.

39:06.267 --> 39:09.167
We're sitting here warming up
to this little smoky fire,

39:09.233 --> 39:12.100
trying to have our, erm,
nice dinner.

39:12.567 --> 39:15.200
Wow, that meat is soft, huh?

39:15.267 --> 39:16.533
Well, we really scored,
look, we got it in

39:16.600 --> 39:18.067
before winter's setting in.

39:18.133 --> 39:19.700
But now we got
these foundations.

39:19.900 --> 39:23.167
We can start with the tent
and go off something
to camp out of that.

39:24.033 --> 39:25.533
Well, it's a good start.

39:31.967 --> 39:34.500
GLENN: You have some
agency out here
that gets taken away

39:34.567 --> 39:37.233
from you in society,
it's a powerful feeling.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.533
One thing I really miss when
I'm down in Fairbanks

39:47.600 --> 39:49.667
is just being able to jump in
the lake and go for a swim

39:49.733 --> 39:51.100
any time I want to.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.767
I tell you, when I'm feeling
tired, dirty,

39:53.833 --> 39:55.533
after cutting that wood, ugh.

39:55.600 --> 39:56.733
There's nothing
like jumping in that lake,

39:56.800 --> 39:58.700
really wakes me up.

39:58.767 --> 40:00.200
I'm gonna go for a swim.

40:06.367 --> 40:09.333
I believe that the cold water
is very therapeutic.

40:09.400 --> 40:10.667
Conditions the body.

40:10.733 --> 40:11.967
Whoo!

40:12.033 --> 40:13.667
Human body's capable of a lot.

40:13.733 --> 40:14.900
People just don't realise it

40:14.967 --> 40:17.100
because they don't come
anywhere near

40:17.300 --> 40:18.567
pushing their limits.

40:19.367 --> 40:21.133
That's ice-cold water!

40:21.200 --> 40:22.333
That feels good!

40:26.300 --> 40:29.400
To live this lifestyle,
you have to be strong.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.067
You have to go out there
and make things happen.

40:33.267 --> 40:35.267
Nobody else
is gonna do it for you.

40:35.900 --> 40:38.600
But on the other hand,
you're also insignificant,

40:38.800 --> 40:40.100
irrelevant,

40:40.767 --> 40:43.100
and really puny compared to

40:43.167 --> 40:45.300
the forces
that are around you.

40:48.500 --> 40:49.833
Very invigorating!

40:49.967 --> 40:51.533
You can't be arrogant,

40:51.633 --> 40:53.967
but at the same time
you have to be strong.

40:54.533 --> 40:56.567
Then you'll do okay,
you'll survive.

40:56.700 --> 40:57.800
As long as you can.

40:57.900 --> 40:59.633
I gotta go in and warm up.

41:00.500 --> 41:01.767
Whoo!

41:04.600 --> 41:06.400
It's great to be
up here again.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.433
SUE: I'll always make it
no matter what I do.

41:14.500 --> 41:16.200
Sometimes I come out
a little skinnier

41:16.267 --> 41:18.433
and sometimes I come out
a little heavier.

41:28.100 --> 41:29.800
Getting a little nicer out.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.633
NARRATOR:
With hunting clients in camp,

41:33.700 --> 41:36.667
and reports of bear scat on
the outskirts of Kavik,

41:36.900 --> 41:40.033
Sue must remain vigilant
in protecting her territory.

41:40.600 --> 41:43.600
When it snows, you're gonna
see who's walking around.

41:43.867 --> 41:46.900
This is not a location you
wander into by accident

41:46.967 --> 41:48.500
and check to see
if there's rentals.

41:48.567 --> 41:50.933
This is an area
you plot, plan,

41:51.000 --> 41:53.267
lease, spend a lifetime

41:53.333 --> 41:55.233
dedicated to overcoming
the hurdles.

41:55.300 --> 41:57.133
And then enjoy
the hell out of it.

42:00.367 --> 42:03.167
This is one of my little high
points I like to come to.

42:03.233 --> 42:06.133
I've got at least
10 miles that way.

42:06.200 --> 42:08.000
You got about
three miles that way,

42:08.067 --> 42:09.133
and maybe a mile that way.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.633
That's a lot of, that's a lot
of real estate

42:11.833 --> 42:13.367
for me to be looking at.

42:14.100 --> 42:17.600
With my super eye sockets,
I can tell you that I do see

42:17.667 --> 42:19.033
what I think is a bear.

42:20.833 --> 42:23.100
I think this is that little
juvenile bear

42:23.167 --> 42:24.700
that I was talking about.

42:25.500 --> 42:27.133
These apex predators,

42:27.200 --> 42:28.533
they do what
I'm doing right now.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.267
They get up on high ground and
they kind of look around.

42:31.400 --> 42:32.967
That little dude
is over there,

42:33.033 --> 42:35.167
and he's on high ground
looking back at me.

42:35.233 --> 42:38.033
That's the way it works to,
to be top dog.

42:38.100 --> 42:39.500
You gain a little elevation,

42:39.567 --> 42:41.000
you see what's out there,

42:41.433 --> 42:44.300
and then you hang it out and
piss all over your territory.

42:46.133 --> 42:47.833
Might be a good idea

42:47.900 --> 42:51.133
to take my gun and just
pop off a couple of rounds.

42:54.633 --> 42:56.467
(GUNSHOT)

42:57.233 --> 42:59.567
That's the warning
to all the predators.

43:02.800 --> 43:04.700
Might seem silly,

43:05.400 --> 43:09.300
but the animals know, boom
means something's going down.

43:09.367 --> 43:12.967
Now, there's not a predator
in this area

43:13.033 --> 43:15.867
that doesn't know
I've got some firepower.

43:17.167 --> 43:21.500
So... But it is time for me
to be get myself back home,

43:24.767 --> 43:26.900
get things buttoned up
for the night.

43:26.967 --> 43:28.367
Brand-new day tomorrow.
