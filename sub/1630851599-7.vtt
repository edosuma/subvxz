WEBVTT

00:00.901 --> 00:01.934
[kevin] when I
designed this car,

00:01.969 --> 00:05.671
I designed it
like the original,
just smoother.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.339
[rick] he was just
putting down your thoughts.

00:07.375 --> 00:08.874
Okay, this has to be
between us.

00:08.909 --> 00:11.210
[dave]<i> we're building</i>
<i> our very first</i>
<i> production vehicle</i>

00:11.245 --> 00:15.080
<i> here at kindig design,</i>
<i> our take on a 1953</i>
<i> chevy corvette.</i>

00:15.116 --> 00:16.982
[foundry man]
<i> light it up.</i>
<i> Up a little.</i>

00:17.018 --> 00:18.550
[dave] oh, man,
that looks good.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.252
I'm watching you.

00:20.287 --> 00:22.021
[kevin]<i> I think</i>
<i> that we're probably</i>
<i> just going to lift</i>

00:22.056 --> 00:23.188
<i> this off with</i>
<i> a bunch of hands.</i>

00:23.224 --> 00:24.690
[dave]<i> we've actually</i>
<i> got potentially</i>

00:24.725 --> 00:26.125
<i> our very first customer.</i>

00:26.160 --> 00:27.359
[rick]
I don't want one.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.128
-So you don't want a car?
-No.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.665
[dave]<i> when I look</i>
<i> at a blank canvas,</i>

00:33.701 --> 00:36.702
<i> I see endless possibilities.</i>

00:36.737 --> 00:40.773
<i> As the ideas come to mind,</i>
<i> the lines start</i>
<i> to fall into place.</i>

00:40.808 --> 00:43.976
<i> And before you know it,</i>
<i> we have a bitchin' ride.</i>

00:44.011 --> 00:45.477
[car engine roaring]

00:45.513 --> 00:47.746
<i> a bitchin' ride</i>
<i> has intense colors...</i>

00:47.782 --> 00:49.214
-[laughs]
<i> -[man</i> 1]<i> this is gorgeous.</i>

00:49.250 --> 00:50.349
<i> ...Performance...</i>

00:50.384 --> 00:52.151
[man 2]<i> it's fantastic.</i>

00:52.186 --> 00:54.119
<i> ...Stance, wheels,</i>

00:54.155 --> 00:55.654
<i> -...Sound.</i>
-[car engine revving]

00:55.689 --> 00:58.090
<i> there's one thing that</i>
<i> makes our car stand out.</i>

00:58.125 --> 01:00.592
<i> -Ours are</i> bitchin rides.
-[car engine roaring]

01:00.628 --> 01:02.127
[kevin]
<i> oh, it never gets old.</i>

01:02.163 --> 01:03.195
[man laughs]

01:04.832 --> 01:06.865
[dave]<i> last year, we took</i>
<i> an opportunity that we had</i>

01:06.901 --> 01:08.967
to build our first
production vehicle

01:09.003 --> 01:10.235
here at kindig-it design.

01:10.271 --> 01:13.672
<i> It's a 1953 corvette</i>
<i> roadster and it's bitchin'.</i>

01:13.707 --> 01:16.608
<i> We took all the parts that it</i>
<i> took to make a 1953 corvette</i>

01:16.644 --> 01:18.143
<i> and made</i>
<i> our own body shape.</i>

01:18.179 --> 01:19.578
<i> Then we pulled</i>
<i> the mold off of it.</i>

01:19.613 --> 01:21.080
-[banging]
-[will]<i> here goes.</i>

01:21.115 --> 01:22.848
It came out awesome.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.817
<i> Super smooth.</i>
<i> A lot of work, but</i>

01:24.852 --> 01:25.918
damn, it looks good.

01:25.953 --> 01:28.253
We send them up to crc,
up in washington,

01:28.289 --> 01:30.656
and our good friend
doug graf started
building us

01:30.691 --> 01:31.990
<i> the carbon fiber bodies.</i>

01:32.026 --> 01:34.960
[doug]<i> there's 30</i>
<i> separate parts, at least.</i>

01:34.995 --> 01:36.195
The first of these cars

01:36.230 --> 01:38.163
we actually lovingly
called it frankenstein

01:38.199 --> 01:40.632
because it took so many
pieces to make it work.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.734
[doug] hard as you try to
make the first one perfect,

01:42.770 --> 01:44.169
the second one
is usually better.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.304
You're right,
right. And that's why

01:45.339 --> 01:48.207
-I picked number three.
-There you go. Smart guy.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.842
After they brought
frankenstein down,

01:49.877 --> 01:52.111
we had an opportunity
to not only put
that car together

01:52.146 --> 01:53.779
and glue it together,
but also we made

01:53.814 --> 01:56.482
all of the little templates
and jigs to make sure that

01:56.517 --> 01:58.016
<i> every one of the</i>
<i> cars come out perfect.</i>

01:58.052 --> 02:00.152
Now that we've proved that
this car is going to work,

02:00.187 --> 02:03.021
we've actually got potentially
our very first customer,

02:03.057 --> 02:05.324
<i> and he's going</i>
<i> to come by the shop</i>
<i> and take a look at it.</i>

02:05.359 --> 02:07.759
Well, I came up to
see the 53 corvette

02:07.795 --> 02:09.695
that dave kindig and I

02:09.730 --> 02:12.598
had been working on
for about five years.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.833
Well, dave told me,
you were coming.

02:14.869 --> 02:17.035
He's sorry he couldn't
be here today,
but he said that

02:17.071 --> 02:19.738
you wanted
to put your eyes on
one of these bodies...

02:19.773 --> 02:21.173
-I did.
-...Before

02:21.208 --> 02:22.708
-you pulled the trigger.
-That's true.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.743
The good thing
about flying up here

02:24.778 --> 02:28.247
all the way is dave's
had a few molds made,

02:28.282 --> 02:30.582
so I'm here to
be able to see,

02:30.618 --> 02:31.984
is this really
what I want to do?

02:32.019 --> 02:33.185
Do I want to spend
money on this?

02:33.220 --> 02:34.353
Let's take a look.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.388
[rick] well, the last time
you just kind of had

02:36.423 --> 02:37.856
pieces glued together,
right? So is this--

02:37.892 --> 02:40.025
yeah. The other
one was kind of just

02:40.060 --> 02:41.326
like, proof of concept.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.628
This is the real thing.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.863
This is an actual carbon body

02:44.899 --> 02:46.465
that we're actually
manufacturing now.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.066
-This is really cool.
-It is really cool.

02:48.102 --> 02:49.902
This is really cool.

02:49.937 --> 02:52.337
My goodness. I mean,
I can picture it.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.173
So what do you think?
Would you want one?

02:54.208 --> 02:55.507
Let's look at it
a little more.

02:55.543 --> 02:56.742
-Okay.
-Come on.

02:56.777 --> 02:59.077
That's fair. I'm working on...
We're working my salesman.

02:59.113 --> 03:00.546
<i> When I was asked</i>
<i> to sell these corvettes,</i>

03:00.581 --> 03:02.848
I was like, hey, kevin,
you're a good looking guy.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.717
If dave can do it,
how hard could it really be?

03:05.753 --> 03:07.786
[rick] what are we going to
do around the lights?

03:07.821 --> 03:09.821
They had wires right,
in the old one.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.490
Yeah, it's going to
have a like a cover,

03:11.525 --> 03:13.692
like an acrylic cover,
and it might have

03:13.727 --> 03:15.494
something
resembling the old one.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.762
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

03:16.797 --> 03:17.996
Mm-hmm. Oh, that's
going to be nice.

03:18.032 --> 03:19.298
But more importantly,
do you want one?

03:19.333 --> 03:20.132
[scoffs]

03:20.167 --> 03:21.166
[rick]<i> I'm listening</i>
<i> to kevin,</i>

03:21.202 --> 03:23.502
it's like he's a car salesman.
Are you serious?

03:23.537 --> 03:25.270
So do you want to buy it?
So you want to buy the car?

03:25.306 --> 03:26.905
You want to buy the car.
Do you want to buy the car?

03:26.941 --> 03:28.674
You want to buy the car?
So what do you think?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.309
Do you want to buy the car?
You want to buy the car?

03:30.344 --> 03:32.010
So you want to buy the car?
Who wants to buy the car?

03:32.046 --> 03:33.512
Do you want to buy the car?
So what do you think?

03:33.547 --> 03:36.014
-Do you want to buy the car?
-Kev, stick
to your day job, all right?

03:36.050 --> 03:37.616
Just build the cars.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.585
The deal is,
I really want to see

03:39.620 --> 03:41.286
how you've been
able to fit it together.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.621
Okay, well,
we can keep going.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.756
Some of
the really cool features
is you can see

03:44.792 --> 03:46.992
how deep
the seat well is.

03:47.027 --> 03:50.429
That allows us to put
the seat back and down.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.064
So instead of
sitting more like

03:52.099 --> 03:53.198
you're sitting in a chair,

03:53.234 --> 03:55.500
right, you're sitting
more like you're in, like,

03:55.536 --> 03:56.969
a semi
lazy boy position.

03:57.004 --> 03:57.869
-Does that make sense?
-Cool, yeah.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.004
That's how
I like to dr

03:59.039 --> 04:00.739
[kevin] yeah, obviously you
can see the gauge,

04:00.774 --> 04:02.841
all the places
where we're going
to cut the holes out.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.376
-Air conditioning?
-Air conditioning

04:04.411 --> 04:05.277
-and heater.
-Power steering?

04:05.312 --> 04:06.712
-Power steering.
-And heater, okay.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.880
650-ish horsepower,

04:08.916 --> 04:10.816
four speed automatic
transmission.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.050
Wow, nice.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.385
Okay, I was
a little aggressive

04:13.420 --> 04:15.687
coming out of the gate,
but I think rick's
coming around.

04:15.723 --> 04:18.590
-You know, I like it.
I think it's so cool.
-Yeah, do you want to buy one?

04:18.626 --> 04:20.025
Uh, let's look
at some more stuff.

04:20.060 --> 04:20.792
Okay.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.194
He knows corvettes,

04:22.229 --> 04:23.762
he knows
what he wants.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.731
He doesn't like
to mess around.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.733
That's probably the
most important thing.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.736
<i> Working trunk. It's not huge,</i>
<i> but it is definitely working.</i>

04:30.771 --> 04:33.472
You can put some bags
like if you go shopping for me

04:33.507 --> 04:35.674
because you have my sizes.
Actually, I'm selling you.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.075
-You want to buy one?
-[chuckles]

04:37.111 --> 04:39.845
you're not a salesman, kev,
just do your mechanics.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.713
Wow. I have
your size, like,

04:41.749 --> 04:43.348
what am I supposed
to carry for you?

04:43.384 --> 04:45.183
Like, if you buy me
a present or something.

04:45.219 --> 04:47.552
-Right, yeah.
-Look, rick,
we go way back.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.122
-We do, yeah. Yeah.
-So, do you want to buy one?

04:51.091 --> 04:52.858
-Wow.
-I feel like you're right

04:52.893 --> 04:54.059
-there on the edge.
-Dave's put

04:54.094 --> 04:56.795
a lot of pressure on you
to get me to say yes.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.363
-Maybe.
-Are you getting a bonus?

04:58.399 --> 04:59.564
We haven't talked about that,

04:59.600 --> 05:01.066
but I don't want
to let him down.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.868
-All right.
-But listen,

05:02.903 --> 05:06.204
what if I did you
a rendering of the car

05:06.240 --> 05:08.307
and threw it in
on the deal free of charge?

05:08.342 --> 05:10.809
If he does a drawing
for me, it's over.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.312
An original kev dog rendering.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.314
I don't want one.
I'm going to...

05:15.349 --> 05:16.882
-So you don't want a car?
-No.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.283
-Or a rendering?
-No.

05:18.319 --> 05:19.951
[chuckles]
no, no, no, no. Stop. Okay.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.520
-Rendering's off the table.
-We're done.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.055
-No. Come on.
-We're done.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.424
-Are you sure?
-Well, are you serious?

05:25.459 --> 05:27.492
-Yeah.
-A kev dog rendering?

05:27.528 --> 05:29.628
People make t-shirts
out of my renderings.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.463
-They do?
-You don't see no t-shirts

05:31.498 --> 05:33.065
-made out of that.
-I've never seen one.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.600
Well, yeah, because
they've sold out so quickly.

05:35.636 --> 05:36.902
-[laughs]
-wow.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.037
I may have almost
ruined things here,

05:39.073 --> 05:40.072
but I can save it.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.412
Hey, rick, how are you?

05:47.448 --> 05:49.181
<i> I'm doing good, sir,</i>
<i> how are you doing?</i>

05:49.216 --> 05:51.183
I'm doing fantastic.
You look sharp today.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.151
Thank you. I missed you,
by the way.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.619
Well, and I apologize.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.321
I was a little
under the weather,

05:56.357 --> 05:58.156
but I understand
that you got in here.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.524
I'm really glad
you made it up.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.027
Kevin was trying to sell me
on the car, right? Like?

06:02.062 --> 06:03.762
[chuckles]
oh, god,

06:03.797 --> 06:05.597
I think he was just trying
to impress me because

06:05.632 --> 06:08.800
I was out sick and he wanted
to send me good news.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.903
And but did he do a good job
of selling you on the car?

06:11.939 --> 06:13.138
[chuckles]

06:15.342 --> 06:17.342
do I need to finish
the job? Okay.

06:17.378 --> 06:18.643
-[laughs]
<i> -let's go, let's go</i>

06:18.679 --> 06:20.545
<i> with he did, yeah,</i>
<i> it was wonderful.</i>

06:20.581 --> 06:22.547
<i> -Let's go with that.</i>
-[laughs]

06:22.583 --> 06:24.850
<i> you know, I just wanted</i>
<i> to talk to you about it</i>

06:24.885 --> 06:27.386
<i> -because, look,</i>
-oh, cool.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.789
<i> You and I talked about</i>
<i> this for a few years, right?</i>

06:30.824 --> 06:32.491
-Yeah.
<i> -And so this has been</i>

06:32.526 --> 06:35.761
<i> a long time thing</i>
<i> that I wanted,</i>

06:35.796 --> 06:39.464
<i> you know,</i>
<i> corvette starts in 53,</i>

06:39.500 --> 06:41.366
<i> I was born in 53.</i>

06:41.402 --> 06:43.268
<i> It's something</i>
<i> I wanted to do.</i>

06:43.303 --> 06:45.904
<i> I said I've</i>
<i> seen the rendering,</i>
<i> which is amazing.</i>

06:45.939 --> 06:47.272
-Thank you.
<i> -Now I've been able</i>

06:47.307 --> 06:49.741
<i> to see the car.</i>
<i> And I like it. But I said,</i>

06:49.777 --> 06:51.643
<i> kevin, I really want</i>
<i> to talk to dave.</i>

06:51.678 --> 06:53.812
<i> "why can't you tell me</i>
<i> that it's okay?</i>

06:53.847 --> 06:55.180
<i> Come on, rick."</i>

06:55.215 --> 06:57.015
<i> -he was working hard.</i>
-[laughs]

06:57.050 --> 06:58.450
he's been
working on you.

06:58.485 --> 07:00.685
<i> Seriously, I wanted</i>
<i> to talk to you because</i>

07:00.721 --> 07:02.587
<i> I wado the deal.</i>

07:02.623 --> 07:03.855
-Okay.
<i> -I want the car.</i>

07:03.891 --> 07:05.490
You get
car number one.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.058
<i> But I kind</i>
<i> of have a condition.</i>

07:07.094 --> 07:08.393
-What would that be?
<i> -Well,</i>

07:08.429 --> 07:10.862
<i> I'm going to invite</i>
<i> a friend of mine in here.</i>

07:10.898 --> 07:12.931
<i> Come on over,</i>
<i> mr. Jones.</i>

07:12.966 --> 07:14.633
Mr. Jones?
Well, hi, dave.

07:14.668 --> 07:17.469
<i> -How are you doing today?</i>
-I'm good.

07:17.504 --> 07:19.037
<i> Sorry to have</i>
<i> surprised you</i>
<i> like this.</i>

07:19.072 --> 07:20.272
Yeah. That is a surprise.

07:20.307 --> 07:23.074
<i> So here's the deal.</i>
<i> I'll take the car,</i>

07:23.110 --> 07:26.378
<i> but I want two. I want one.</i>
<i> Dave wants one.</i>

07:26.413 --> 07:29.014
You guys are going
to make me cry. Wow.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.082
<i> The only thing that's</i>
<i> going to make rick cry,</i>

07:31.118 --> 07:32.551
<i> is when you</i>
<i> build my car</i>

07:32.586 --> 07:34.453
<i> and it's going</i>
<i> to be better than his.</i>

07:34.488 --> 07:36.855
-[laughs]
<i> -well, you know, we'll see.</i>

07:36.890 --> 07:39.424
<i> Yeah, I mean,</i>
<i> that's what kevin told me.</i>

07:39.460 --> 07:42.394
Kevin sold you
on another car. So, oh god.

07:42.429 --> 07:43.795
<i> -Here we go.</i>
-You know what?

07:43.831 --> 07:46.364
I'm not in any position
to say no to this.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.400
<i> -Can you do two?</i>
-My plan is to do more

07:48.435 --> 07:50.335
than one,
and I would be so honored.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.003
I think that's awesome.
So, rick,

07:52.039 --> 07:54.372
you get car number one and
dave you're car number two.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.476
<i> Well, as long as</i>
<i> I get number one.</i>

07:57.511 --> 07:59.511
-[laughs]
<i> -if number two is better</i>

07:59.546 --> 08:02.481
<i> than number one.</i>
<i> We'll all be good.</i>

08:02.516 --> 08:04.816
Well, we got to do it
a different color, dave.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.251
<i> I don't want a plain</i>
<i> old white thing.</i>

08:06.286 --> 08:07.686
<i> I was thinking</i>
<i> more of a</i>

08:07.721 --> 08:10.622
<i> kind of a silverish with</i>
<i> maybe some blue on it.</i>

08:10.657 --> 08:15.894
<i> You know, rick's has got</i>
<i> 670 horsepower, I want 680.</i>

08:15.929 --> 08:18.563
Okay. A jet pack,
it is for you.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.165
Let me write
this stuff down.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.399
[laughs]

08:21.435 --> 08:24.503
<i> my poor little white car</i>
<i> with red interior,</i>

08:24.538 --> 08:26.571
<i> and you're going</i>
<i> to get a better one.</i>

08:26.607 --> 08:28.974
<i> Well, anybody can do</i>
<i> white and red, rick.</i>

08:29.009 --> 08:30.108
<i> Hmm.</i>

08:30.143 --> 08:32.077
I love you two guys
so much.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.913
But you right now,
are reminding me
of the two muppet guys

08:34.948 --> 08:36.248
up in the top
balcony.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.583
[laughs]

08:38.619 --> 08:40.986
-I know, right?
-Another small request.

08:41.021 --> 08:44.890
-Shoot.
-What if you unveiled them
both on the same show?

08:44.925 --> 08:48.960
Let's do it. Let's see
what we can do.
But I am all in.

08:48.996 --> 08:51.563
No. The only real
problem with that

08:51.598 --> 08:54.199
is that if you do take these
to some kind of show thing

08:54.234 --> 08:56.468
-and his wins over mine...
-Well, you know it will.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.370
...I will burn his
to the ground.

08:58.405 --> 08:59.804
[laughs]

08:59.840 --> 09:01.106
you know
it's going to win.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.141
Carbon fiber
doesn't burn like that.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.877
-Oh, well, you know--
-I'm just making it up, but--

09:05.913 --> 09:08.680
oh, you did?
I'll use aviation fuel.

09:08.715 --> 09:12.417
Yeah, that will
burn anything.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.319
That's a no brainer, really.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.054
Speaking of no brainer,
hang on one second.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.656
Let's hold that,
kevin's in here.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.425
What's up, guys?

09:20.460 --> 09:23.061
<i> He calls me and says, "hey,</i>
<i> buddy, this kevin called me."</i>

09:23.096 --> 09:25.430
<i> and he goes, "he wants</i>
<i> to know if I wanted a 53.</i>

09:25.465 --> 09:27.866
<i> Now you need to talk</i>
<i> to kindig, and--"</i>

09:27.901 --> 09:29.834
so it's you. It's you.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.237
<i> He goes, "why?" and I said,</i>
<i> "because I did that."</i>

09:32.272 --> 09:35.040
<i> and I said, "I think</i>
<i> he's a little bugger."</i>

09:35.075 --> 09:36.308
-yeah.
-And you just couldn't

09:36.343 --> 09:38.443
-close the deal, kevin.
-What do you mean?

09:38.478 --> 09:40.745
You're not a closer
is what he said.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.281
I think it's you
guys' bedtime.

09:43.317 --> 09:45.717
Take your guys' medicine
before you go to bed.

09:45.752 --> 09:46.851
[laughs]

09:46.887 --> 09:47.986
don't talk
to the clients like that.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.321
-[kevin] I'm sorry, I forgot.
-[laughs]

09:49.356 --> 09:51.489
do you guys want one
of my renderings still?

09:51.525 --> 09:56.094
-It's still...
The offer still stands.
<i> -Well, I think I'm good.</i>

09:56.129 --> 09:57.562
-Okay, I really, please--
-[cross-talk]

09:57.598 --> 10:00.332
[laughs]

10:00.367 --> 10:02.334
<i> yeah. I think I'd like to see</i>

10:02.369 --> 10:04.069
<i> what I'm going to</i>
<i> get out of this deal.</i>

10:04.104 --> 10:05.170
[kevin]
yeah, I mean, I agree.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.239
I'll do some
renderings for you guys.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.808
[laughs]
I'll send them down to you.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.610
Rick, don't worry,
you already got yours.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.578
I really think that you guys
need to get some supper

10:13.614 --> 10:16.381
and go ahead
and head for the bed.

10:16.416 --> 10:19.117
I'm just concerned
that if dave sees
the rendering,

10:19.152 --> 10:20.518
he's going to have
to go to therapy.

10:20.554 --> 10:22.320
I take two green ones
in the morning

10:22.356 --> 10:23.755
and then a yellow one
late at night,

10:23.790 --> 10:25.557
and I don't even pay
attention to it anymore.

10:25.592 --> 10:26.925
-[kevin]<i> see?</i>
-I'm numb.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.360
That's why I can't
talk to you guys.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.295
You guys are all pilled up,
every single one of you.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.596
You and you
and you,

10:31.632 --> 10:33.898
all of you guys
are all on pills
just to put up with me,

10:33.934 --> 10:35.367
and I don't think
that's very nice.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.135
Hang on, let me take
another one real quick here.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.837
I got a whole
baggie full of them.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.872
-I got to go.
-[laughs]

10:40.907 --> 10:43.308
gentlemen,
thank you so much.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.011
Super excited, dave,
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.245
Rick, thank you again.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.413
You guys are making
a dream come true,

10:48.448 --> 10:49.714
-so thank you.
-You are welcome. Thank you.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.586
[dave]<i> so when the 1953</i>
<i> corvette came out,</i>

10:54.621 --> 10:56.521
<i> they were all available</i>

10:56.556 --> 10:58.556
in whatever color you wanted
as long as it was

10:58.592 --> 11:01.726
polo white with red interior.
[chuckles]

11:01.762 --> 11:05.563
and rick, was born in 1953,
so he is my original.

11:05.599 --> 11:08.233
I developed a white color
a while back.

11:08.268 --> 11:11.202
It's no strings white. It's
part of my modern classic,

11:11.238 --> 11:14.039
<i> and I think it's going to</i>
<i> look exceptional with this</i>

11:14.074 --> 11:17.108
<i> really cool,</i>
<i> orangish red interior.</i>

11:17.144 --> 11:20.045
<i> Dave has a really</i>
<i> great collection of cars</i>

11:20.080 --> 11:22.547
<i> if I put another</i>
<i> vehicle in his garage,</i>

11:22.582 --> 11:24.382
<i> I want it to be</i>
<i> unique and different.</i>

11:24.418 --> 11:26.951
<i> So I'm kind of thinking</i>
<i> a pearl silver</i>

11:26.987 --> 11:30.488
<i> with a periwinkle</i>
<i> blue leather.</i>

11:30.524 --> 11:32.457
<i> And maybe what I'll do is</i>
<i> I'll add a little bit of that</i>

11:32.492 --> 11:34.592
<i> blue color into the silver</i>

11:34.628 --> 11:36.461
creating peri-silver.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.229
Peri-silver.
Yeah, that's what.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.931
So I'm going to
do a peri-silver.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.800
<i> When I first started building</i>

11:41.835 --> 11:43.868
<i> this whole concept</i>
<i> of a corvette,</i>

11:43.904 --> 11:46.104
<i> I really thought</i>
<i> that it would take</i>
<i> a little bit longer,</i>

11:46.139 --> 11:47.772
<i> and might be a little bit</i>
<i> more of a challenge</i>

11:47.808 --> 11:49.207
<i> to get a couple</i>
<i> of these sold.</i>

11:49.242 --> 11:51.009
<i> And to be honest with you,</i>
<i> for two of them</i>

11:51.044 --> 11:52.243
<i> to already be sold,</i>

11:52.279 --> 11:54.145
<i> if this is any tell tale</i>
<i>of where we're going to end up</i>

11:54.181 --> 11:56.448
with these cars.
Um...

11:56.483 --> 11:58.183
Yeah,
this will be pretty cool.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.718
<i> It's the perfect car.</i>

11:59.753 --> 12:02.287
<i> It's the perfect color</i>
<i> for the perfect client.</i>

12:02.322 --> 12:04.155
And what is cooler than that?

12:04.991 --> 12:06.157
Doing two.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.359
<i> You know,</i>
<i> with the bodies being built</i>

12:08.395 --> 12:09.861
<i> and everything else,</i>
<i> there's a lot of other things</i>

12:09.896 --> 12:11.496
that need to be checked off.
So I'm going to get with

12:11.531 --> 12:13.131
all of the departments,
all of the guys,

12:13.166 --> 12:14.599
and get their
brainstorms to see

12:14.634 --> 12:15.734
how we can do this

12:15.769 --> 12:18.369
over and over
and over again.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.039
These are car one
and two.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.474
And they're going
to be awesome.

12:28.648 --> 12:29.481
<i> I know that there's</i>
<i> a few details</i>

12:29.516 --> 12:30.448
<i> that still need</i>
<i> to be figured out,</i>

12:30.484 --> 12:31.750
so I'm going to get
the guys together.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.218
We're going to have a
meeting and make sure that

12:33.253 --> 12:35.120
we can get all of
this into production.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.422
Guys, how are we
doing on this car?

12:37.457 --> 12:39.691
Still just working out
the tidbits. It's coming.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.526
Everything that we're
putting together right now

12:41.561 --> 12:42.794
needs to be able to be

12:42.829 --> 12:44.696
replicated over
and over again.

12:44.731 --> 12:47.565
<i> I am so excited to see</i>
<i> our very first cf1 roadster</i>

12:47.601 --> 12:48.633
<i> go to rick cox.</i>

12:48.668 --> 12:50.735
I know he's going to be
super excited to have it.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.470
<i> And I'm so excited</i>
<i> to build it for him.</i>

12:52.506 --> 12:54.906
So how many corvettes
have we done for him now?

12:54.941 --> 12:57.242
-One, two...
-Three.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.511
This one is going
to be awesome, and

13:00.213 --> 13:01.746
he was born in 1953.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.748
I think the biggest
thing at this point

13:03.784 --> 13:06.251
that me and jason and will
have been talking about is,

13:06.286 --> 13:08.520
I mean, how many do
you think that you can sell?

13:08.555 --> 13:11.122
-And the reason that
we ask that is because...
-Well, why is that?

13:11.158 --> 13:13.224
...There's a lot of parts.
Obviously, we make

13:13.260 --> 13:14.926
one-off parts here
all day long for cars.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.728
-We make them one time.
-Right.

13:16.763 --> 13:19.664
If we're going to make
five of these cars,

13:19.699 --> 13:20.932
ten of these cars,

13:20.967 --> 13:22.834
we probably
should look
into making

13:22.869 --> 13:24.068
these parts
a little bit different.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.337
Well, that was
the entire idea
of the entire project,

13:26.373 --> 13:28.573
so that's genius
of you to bring it up.

13:28.608 --> 13:29.808
We just haven't
done that yet.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.543
Well, no, and that's
what we need to do.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.911
That's why we made
a mold so we can have

13:32.946 --> 13:35.079
the exact same body
get popped out
every single time.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.548
There's a couple of changes
that greg and I

13:36.583 --> 13:39.684
are going to get to
on the windshield
and the door trim.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.486
And then simple
stuff like plumbing,

13:41.521 --> 13:43.655
like the transmission
cooler lines,

13:43.690 --> 13:45.557
brake lines
that are custom
for this car.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.225
Right. I know that you guys
kind of brought that up.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.593
So this car
realistically,

13:48.628 --> 13:50.328
there's still a lot
of prototype pieces.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.530
So let's do brake lines,
fuel lines, trans lines,

13:52.566 --> 13:54.232
all of that stuff
that we would need.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.434
Let's send them out
and get them all built

13:56.469 --> 13:58.636
by somebody else,
if that's more reasonable.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.605
I want to try and keep
the costs down
on these cars.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.073
Okay. No, I'm all about it.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.708
I think we're probably
about a month out

14:03.743 --> 14:05.109
from having all
this stuff completed.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.277
I think
that's a wrap.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.646
Jason, is your list
as long as this one?

14:08.682 --> 14:10.381
-Mine is longer.
-Mine's short.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.016
These are just things
I'm taking care of.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.218
We're talking
about list stuff?

14:13.253 --> 14:14.752
-Where's your list?
-Where's your list?

14:14.788 --> 14:17.188
-All right here.
-[scoffs]

14:17.224 --> 14:19.390
-yup.
-Can we get that
in paper?

14:19.426 --> 14:20.658
Can you print that out for me?

14:20.694 --> 14:22.026
Hit the print button,
please.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.929
[imitating clicking sound]

14:24.965 --> 14:26.064
[laughs]

14:26.099 --> 14:28.132
it's an old one too.
It's an older one.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.934
It's older list
but it's reliable.

14:29.970 --> 14:33.004
It's ink and paper,
all between my ears.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.372
-Oh, that's funny.
-Like, I need to have

14:34.407 --> 14:36.040
everything written down here.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.809
I know what I'm doing,
and I know

14:37.844 --> 14:38.977
this car is going
to be bitchin'.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.512
-This is going to be fast.
-Yeah.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.214
Speaking of fast.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.750
Get to work.
You want to hang that.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.720
[tutting]

14:48.755 --> 14:50.488
I'm watching you,
wrinkle man.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.857
I'm going to take
some notes off of it.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.360
I'll be kicking your ass
if you wrinkle that paper.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.428
All right. I got to go.
That's enough one-liners.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.699
<i> We're building</i>
<i> our very first</i>
<i> production vehicle</i>

15:01.735 --> 15:05.203
<i> here at kindig design, our</i>
<i>take on a 1953 chevy corvette.</i>

15:05.238 --> 15:07.672
<i> One of the biggest tasks</i>
<i> at this time is to make sure</i>

15:07.707 --> 15:09.874
that we're making parts
that can be replicated

15:09.910 --> 15:11.409
over and over again
so that everything

15:11.444 --> 15:13.177
isn't one off
for every single car.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.046
[greg]<i> so I've been</i>
<i> tasked with basically</i>

15:15.081 --> 15:17.682
<i> managing all the production</i>
<i> for the trim,</i>

15:17.717 --> 15:20.118
<i> and the bumpers,</i>
<i> and the windshield,</i>

15:20.153 --> 15:23.655
things like that.
So I'm trying
to make them repeatable.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.624
What I'm doing here is,
this is a production
casting pattern.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.326
This portion is

15:28.361 --> 15:30.662
the piece of trim
that goes around
the back of the seat.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.231
I'm doing it a little
unconventionally.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.133
So I 3d printed
the pieces.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.269
This is stratasys nylon,

15:38.305 --> 15:40.138
which is super strong,
super rigid.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.472
I had to print it
in two pieces,

15:41.508 --> 15:42.941
so it'd fit
in our printer.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.376
That's where
they'll pour
the aluminum in,

15:45.412 --> 15:49.314
and then it goes
down these pieces
into our final piece.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.449
So there's
a lot of waste there,
it'll get cut off.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.918
Then our trim pieces are,
you know,

15:53.954 --> 15:55.586
95% of the way there.

15:55.622 --> 15:56.921
The aluminum that these

15:56.957 --> 15:58.823
will be cast out of
is still malleable.

15:58.858 --> 16:01.292
I can still bend it
and tweak it
and make it perfect,

16:01.328 --> 16:04.262
but I think it'll, you know,
be a really nice head start.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.298
These 3d printed
pieces are going

16:07.334 --> 16:09.233
<i> to be used to make an</i>
<i> impression in the sand,</i>

16:09.269 --> 16:11.035
and that negative space
is going to be filled

16:11.071 --> 16:13.404
with molten aluminum
to make our castings.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.073
Now that I have
the pieces printed,

16:15.108 --> 16:18.910
I'm going to cut
some pieces of steel rod
that will go in these.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.845
So once I glue these
two pieces together,

16:20.880 --> 16:23.247
I'm going to glue them
onto some pieces of wood

16:23.283 --> 16:25.183
and then those pieces
are just ready to go,

16:25.218 --> 16:28.152
so the foundry can make me
ten of these at a time,

16:28.188 --> 16:31.622
<i> rather than having</i>
<i> to hand carve</i>
<i> the sand for each one,</i>

16:31.658 --> 16:33.324
<i> which would be expensive.</i>
<i> Kind of a cool process,</i>

16:33.360 --> 16:35.093
<i> this is something I'm pretty</i>
<i> passionate about,</i>

16:35.128 --> 16:36.561
<i> so I was</i>
<i> pretty excited,</i>

16:36.596 --> 16:37.462
<i> when we got</i>
<i> to get into it.</i>

16:40.533 --> 16:42.967
So the way I printed these,
I didn't just cut it in half,

16:43.003 --> 16:44.335
I put a step,

16:44.371 --> 16:46.838
so that it will have
a little bit
of strength there.

16:46.873 --> 16:49.540
And then to make sure
that it doesn't buckle,

16:50.076 --> 16:51.709
I'm putting pins in here

16:51.745 --> 16:54.779
that will align everything
and it'll give it
some strength.

16:54.814 --> 16:57.081
I'm using two different
types of glue.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.550
I'm using
the power bond stuff
that we use,

16:59.586 --> 17:02.086
like, to glue quarter
panels onto the cars

17:02.122 --> 17:03.588
to glue this
to the boards.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.057
<i> I'm not going to get it</i>
<i> as easy as I was hoping,</i>

17:06.092 --> 17:07.658
<i> but to glue the boards</i>
<i> together because</i>

17:07.694 --> 17:09.060
<i> I'm going to</i>
<i> sandwich it in there,</i>

17:09.095 --> 17:10.495
<i> I'm just using</i>
<i> regular wood glue.</i>

17:19.973 --> 17:21.572
These boards have
to be smooth so that

17:21.608 --> 17:24.809
when they take
the sand impressions
from both sides,

17:24.844 --> 17:27.412
they have
nice flat surfaces
to mate together.

17:27.447 --> 17:28.880
<i> So I'll just cut off</i>
<i> all the screw heads</i>

17:28.915 --> 17:31.783
<i> and just sand everything</i>
<i> and then it's good to go</i>
<i> to the foundry.</i>

17:31.818 --> 17:33.418
<i> I picked</i>
<i> the easy ones first.</i>

17:33.453 --> 17:35.820
But this next one's
going to be really big

17:35.855 --> 17:36.921
and I'm going
to need a hand with it.

17:48.134 --> 17:49.967
What are you doing?

17:50.003 --> 17:52.203
You want to take a break
and help me lift
something heavy?

17:52.238 --> 17:54.505
-Sure.
-Cool.
[chuckles]

17:55.141 --> 17:56.874
yeah. It's not that heavy.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.242
We're just going
to set it right on top,

17:58.278 --> 18:00.478
and these little tabs
will kind of sit in there.

18:04.150 --> 18:05.583
Right on. Thanks.

18:05.618 --> 18:06.684
Oh wait, while you're here,

18:06.719 --> 18:07.952
you want to help
me do one more?

18:07.987 --> 18:09.153
This is the top.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.760
Cool. I think that's good.
Awesome, thank you.

18:15.795 --> 18:19.097
This perimeter is
the windshield frame.

18:19.132 --> 18:21.766
And then this is all the
gating and the runners

18:21.801 --> 18:23.634
that the molten
aluminum will go through.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.838
So it's pretty big.
I used aluminum plates

18:26.873 --> 18:28.606
in the center
rather than all wood,

18:28.641 --> 18:29.907
so that it's a little stiffer.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.676
<i> And then it screws together</i>

18:31.711 --> 18:34.112
<i> rather than</i>
<i> gluing it together.</i>

18:34.147 --> 18:36.881
-[drilling sound]
-[banging]

18:36.916 --> 18:38.049
<i> greg has just wrapped up</i>

18:38.084 --> 18:39.984
on the final pattern
for the foundry.

18:40.019 --> 18:42.687
Now the big question
here is will it actually work?

18:44.858 --> 18:48.693
[music plays]

18:51.231 --> 18:53.498
[rattling]

18:57.353 --> 18:59.854
today, all of our really good
friends out at state brass

18:59.889 --> 19:01.455
are going to get
a special delivery.

19:01.491 --> 19:03.558
This is all of the parts
it's going to take to make

19:03.593 --> 19:05.126
<i> one of our cf1 roadsters.</i>

19:06.296 --> 19:08.095
<i> Any first time</i>
<i> you do something,</i>

19:08.131 --> 19:09.864
<i> the big question is</i>
<i> will it work?</i>

19:09.899 --> 19:12.099
<i> We've done a lot</i>
<i> of this casting</i>
<i> with these guys.</i>

19:12.135 --> 19:13.501
They certainly
know their job.

19:13.536 --> 19:15.603
I think we got
a pretty good idea
of what we're doing.

19:15.638 --> 19:17.138
<i> So let's see how it does.</i>

19:17.173 --> 19:19.473
[foundry man]
<i> it's called nix stix.</i>

19:19.509 --> 19:21.242
<i> Slather it on.</i>

19:21.277 --> 19:23.277
It's just
a release agent,

19:23.313 --> 19:25.479
so I'm going
to face it with

19:25.515 --> 19:27.949
a mix of new and
reclaimed sand.

19:27.984 --> 19:29.617
So this is the mix

19:29.652 --> 19:32.520
between new and
reclaimed sand,

19:32.555 --> 19:34.488
kind of looks like
a salt and pepper.

19:34.524 --> 19:36.958
Once the entire pattern
is based

19:36.993 --> 19:38.860
I'm going to switch over
to reclaim only,

19:38.895 --> 19:40.428
it's a cost saver,

19:40.463 --> 19:42.463
but it will
set up the same

19:43.199 --> 19:45.433
as the new
or reclaimed sands.

19:45.468 --> 19:48.169
Switch over to reclaim only,
and this is

19:48.204 --> 19:50.238
pretty much black.

19:50.273 --> 19:52.840
<i> Should take</i>
<i> about five minutes</i>
<i> to fill this in and</i>

19:53.443 --> 19:54.475
pack it down tight.

19:57.313 --> 19:59.647
I got a little bit too much
on there, obviously,

19:59.682 --> 20:03.184
you see that, but I
just want to leave a nice

20:04.254 --> 20:06.687
level surface
here on the box,

20:06.723 --> 20:08.055
so none of this
will go to waste.

20:08.091 --> 20:11.425
We'll just throw it back
in the reclaimer

20:11.461 --> 20:13.361
and use it again
tomorrow.

20:13.396 --> 20:16.297
Now we're going to poke
some vents into the sand.

20:16.332 --> 20:18.599
As the metal goes in
and heats up the sand,

20:18.635 --> 20:21.002
it releases gas

20:21.037 --> 20:23.170
and you don't want
that stuck in there.

20:23.206 --> 20:25.573
It can leave some
imperfections in your casting.

20:25.608 --> 20:28.042
And I'm going to take
a mallet and kind of

20:28.077 --> 20:29.744
vibrate the board
just a little bit.

20:29.779 --> 20:32.380
Make it settle nice,
so there's no voids

20:32.415 --> 20:35.216
or imperfections
in the packing of the sand.

20:35.251 --> 20:36.384
Once they set the sand,

20:36.419 --> 20:37.852
they can now
remove the buck that

20:37.887 --> 20:39.654
greg built
out of the metal.

20:39.689 --> 20:41.856
[foundry man] whenever
you're pulling a box
off a pattern

20:41.891 --> 20:44.659
or the pattern out of the box,
you want to do it

20:44.694 --> 20:47.161
<i> as steadily and straight up</i>
<i> as possible.</i>

20:49.399 --> 20:52.566
So it's a pretty clean draw,
you can see over here,

20:52.602 --> 20:55.236
it's going to create
an extra fin on the casting,

20:55.271 --> 20:57.271
shouldn't be a problem.
We can just

20:57.307 --> 20:59.640
clean that off
in the clean-up room.

20:59.676 --> 21:03.444
And that may be
due to a lack of draft
on the pattern.

21:03.479 --> 21:06.380
It may be because
when I came up,
I wasn't exactly

21:06.950 --> 21:07.982
square.

21:08.885 --> 21:10.217
It should be okay.

21:11.888 --> 21:15.156
So this other side is
just a runner and contact,

21:15.191 --> 21:17.758
set this aside
over here.

21:17.794 --> 21:19.460
So with that,
we'll blow it off.

21:20.430 --> 21:22.029
It's just called
gray wash,

21:22.065 --> 21:25.333
as if you were
starting with some
really fine clean mud

21:25.368 --> 21:28.636
and mix it with alcohol
to be able to spray with it.

21:28.671 --> 21:30.137
Kind of like a paint,

21:30.173 --> 21:32.740
and it just fills in the grit
of the sand,

21:32.775 --> 21:35.943
creates a nice, smooth surface
on your cast.

21:35.979 --> 21:37.845
Once the gray wash
has been applied
to the molds,

21:37.880 --> 21:39.580
they then burn off
the alcohol.

21:39.615 --> 21:42.817
We're going to light it up
so that it'll dry

21:44.187 --> 21:46.954
and, uh, bake it in.

21:46.990 --> 21:48.889
[whooshing sound]

21:48.925 --> 21:51.559
this is a great activity
in the wintertime,

21:51.594 --> 21:54.528
helps warm the building,
but not so much in the summer.

21:54.564 --> 21:56.597
[dave]<i> they're now ready</i>
<i> to pour the molten aluminum.</i>

21:56.632 --> 21:58.366
<i> Of course, they're going</i>
<i> to have to get it molten.</i>

21:58.401 --> 22:00.201
So what they're going to do
is go ahead and throw

22:00.236 --> 22:05.439
everything into this kick ass
electromagnetic melting kiln.

22:05.475 --> 22:09.744
[western classical music
playing]

22:21.791 --> 22:23.958
once the aluminum
is in a liquid form,

22:23.993 --> 22:25.593
they're going to pour it and
we're going to have parts.

[clanking sound]

22:31.601 --> 22:33.868
[foundry man]<i> now, it's just</i>
<i> sticking a degassing pipe</i>

22:33.903 --> 22:36.504
<i> down there and</i>
<i> it's got nitrogen gas,</i>

<i> which is heavier than oxygen,</i>
<i> so it forces the oxygen</i>

22:39.609 --> 22:42.276
<i> and gas bubbles up</i>
<i> out of the aluminum.</i>

22:42.311 --> 22:43.477
Up a little.

Man, I'm stoked.

24:15.471 --> 24:17.438
So this kind of gives us
a little bit of a head start.

24:17.473 --> 24:18.973
You know, we can just

24:19.008 --> 24:21.142
fine tune the fitment
on these and...

24:21.177 --> 24:22.610
Can we set
the windshield frame on?

24:22.645 --> 24:24.411
I am so stoked to see what
that looks like on the car.

24:24.447 --> 24:26.614
Let's go. The one part that
might have been the trickiest

24:26.649 --> 24:29.316
would be the windshield frame
simply for the size of it,

24:29.352 --> 24:32.353
the amount of cast aluminum
that has to go into the play

24:32.388 --> 24:34.388
and how much space
is between there.

24:34.423 --> 24:35.756
All right. Let's see
how this thing looks.

24:35.791 --> 24:36.991
Yeah, moment of truth.

24:37.026 --> 24:39.126
[singing]
na, na, na, na, na.

24:39.162 --> 24:41.395
And the winner is... Oh,
man, look at that.

24:49.539 --> 24:51.071
Oh, man, that looks good.

24:52.175 --> 24:54.642
[happy music plays]

24:54.677 --> 24:56.043
<i> and this is going</i>
<i> to be exciting.</i>

24:56.078 --> 24:58.412
Every time another
piece goes on this car,

24:58.447 --> 25:00.447
I just get one more
goose bump, maybe three.

25:00.483 --> 25:02.483
-Yeah, yeah.
-This is rad.

25:03.119 --> 25:04.518
You know,
looking at it now

25:04.554 --> 25:05.786
and with this step in here,
I'm just

25:05.821 --> 25:07.388
really starting to see
the car come alive.

25:07.423 --> 25:09.657
It's really got some
good character.

25:09.692 --> 25:11.959
And I think when this car
is sitting down on the ground

25:11.994 --> 25:13.360
all painted, this is chrome,

25:13.396 --> 25:15.930
the windshield is in, and the
leather is in there and stuff,

25:15.965 --> 25:17.998
I think it's just
going to look fantastic.

25:18.034 --> 25:19.300
You know,
I think doing it this way

25:19.335 --> 25:20.901
is going to save
so much time.

25:20.937 --> 25:22.403
-Exactly.
-And then, you know,

25:22.438 --> 25:24.338
the car comes in,
we can just take

25:24.373 --> 25:26.574
maybe a week to
fit all the bumpers,

25:26.609 --> 25:29.843
fit all the trim, and just
get it to the next stage.

25:29.879 --> 25:31.512
-Right.
-This is a cool process.

25:31.547 --> 25:34.415
Yeah. I'm glad you kind of
just let me loose on it, and

25:34.450 --> 25:35.749
it seems like
it's working out pretty well.

25:35.785 --> 25:37.985
I'm pumped.
Looks wonderful, greg.
Good job.

25:38.020 --> 25:39.153
Right on. Thanks, dave.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.656
[dave]<i> we just got all of the</i>
<i> parts back from the foundry,</i>

25:42.692 --> 25:44.325
<i> and we know that the</i>
<i> windshield is going to fit,</i>

25:44.360 --> 25:46.727
<i> but we need to really</i>
<i> pre-fit everything else.</i>

25:46.762 --> 25:48.162
Assuming that this works,

25:48.197 --> 25:50.231
this will be great because
now we can make a pattern

25:50.266 --> 25:51.532
for every one of these parts

25:51.567 --> 25:53.434
and repeat it over
and over again.

25:53.469 --> 25:56.337
[greg]<i> I just need to kind of</i>
<i> go over all these pieces.</i>

25:56.372 --> 25:59.240
<i> I put these little dimples</i>
<i> for where they get drilled</i>

25:59.275 --> 26:01.675
<i> -and tapped for the mounting.</i>
-[clanking sound]

26:01.711 --> 26:03.210
<i> let's go see</i>
<i> how this stuff fits.</i>

26:05.348 --> 26:06.580
Oh, it fits pretty good.

26:06.616 --> 26:08.349
The nice thing
about the aluminum

26:08.384 --> 26:11.085
that they cast it out of
is still a little malleable,

26:11.120 --> 26:13.387
so we can kind of
tweak it and make it fit

26:13.422 --> 26:16.090
exactly perfect. Needs
a little bit of tweaking.

26:16.125 --> 26:18.592
Oh, I think it might
actually just be this.

26:18.628 --> 26:20.394
And I stand off the gating.

26:20.429 --> 26:21.962
<i> I think it will</i>
<i> sit right here.</i>

26:21.998 --> 26:23.864
<i> You can see it's a</i>
<i> little high right there.</i>

26:23.899 --> 26:26.000
And this one,
if you look from the side,

26:26.035 --> 26:27.401
<i> you can see</i>
<i> it's a little taller</i>

26:27.436 --> 26:28.535
<i> than the edge of the bumper.</i>

26:28.571 --> 26:30.604
<i> And I did those because</i>

26:30.640 --> 26:31.939
<i> when you mount it,</i>

26:31.974 --> 26:34.241
<i> it leaves a little bit</i>
<i> of a bump or gap.</i>

26:34.277 --> 26:35.843
Yeah,
I'm really excited about that.

26:35.878 --> 26:37.044
It fits really well.

26:37.079 --> 26:40.247
Then the last one I've got
right here is the door spears.

26:40.916 --> 26:43.250
So these ones are

26:43.286 --> 26:44.952
going to go right about here.

26:44.987 --> 26:47.288
I just need to sand
this little piece off.

26:47.323 --> 26:49.657
<i> That's just part</i>
<i> of the casting process,</i>

26:49.692 --> 26:51.925
<i> and it'll sit</i>
<i> right into there.</i>

26:51.961 --> 26:53.527
And then the front piece

26:53.562 --> 26:56.363
goes right here and goes up
along the front fender.

26:56.399 --> 26:57.498
<i> Turned out really good, and</i>

26:57.533 --> 26:59.300
<i> this is going to</i>
<i> work well to make</i>

26:59.335 --> 27:00.534
<i> a bunch of versions.</i>

27:00.569 --> 27:02.836
You know, we could
make this stuff by hand, but

27:02.872 --> 27:04.872
making it by hand
five times in a row

27:04.907 --> 27:06.140
doesn't sound like
a lot of fun to me.

27:06.175 --> 27:07.641
I'm extremely happy with

27:07.677 --> 27:09.810
how everything is
fitting on this car,

27:09.845 --> 27:11.812
and this is awesome because
we'll be able to repeat this

27:11.847 --> 27:15.115
over and over again, and it
makes our life a lot simpler.

27:15.151 --> 27:17.418
All right. I got a lot of work
to sand these things off.

27:21.857 --> 27:25.859
[music plays]

27:26.329 --> 27:30.798
[whooshing sound]

27:38.140 --> 27:41.909
[whooshing sound]

27:44.880 --> 27:46.980
[dave]<i> once greg</i>
<i> finishes sanding and fitting</i>

27:47.016 --> 27:48.449
<i> all of these aluminum pieces,</i>

27:48.484 --> 27:49.750
it's time to get
them off to chrome.

27:49.785 --> 27:51.719
<i> But that just opens up</i>
<i> a little bit more time</i>

27:51.754 --> 27:53.120
<i> for all of the rest</i>
<i> of the stuff that still</i>

27:53.155 --> 27:54.388
<i> needs to happen with the car.</i>

27:56.659 --> 27:57.825
[whooshing sound]

27:57.860 --> 27:59.560
there's a lot of
stuff still to do,

27:59.595 --> 28:01.161
but it's getting
exciting in the kitchen.

28:01.197 --> 28:03.731
Okay, well,
we got rick's car here.

28:03.766 --> 28:06.533
Compared to the
non-production car,

28:06.569 --> 28:08.969
our car over there.
What are we missing?

28:09.004 --> 28:11.605
I know we need the
under cowl structure.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.707
<i> We need the center</i>
<i> console glued in.</i>

28:13.743 --> 28:15.509
We were noticing
some spots that we need

28:15.544 --> 28:17.845
-to glue in the front, still.
-Okay.

28:17.880 --> 28:21.181
Just seeing this isn't
glued yet,
this to the firewall.

28:21.217 --> 28:22.916
To the firewall. Okay.

28:22.952 --> 28:24.084
And that will be dictated by

28:24.120 --> 28:25.652
the windshield at this point,
yeah?

28:25.688 --> 28:26.954
-Yes.
-I'm kind of looking

28:26.989 --> 28:28.088
at this too.

28:28.124 --> 28:30.224
The gap right here on
the back of the doors,

28:30.259 --> 28:32.359
<i> kevin looked at it earlier</i>
<i> and he's thinking that</i>

28:32.395 --> 28:34.261
<i> we're a little bit low.</i>
<i> Do you think we need more</i>

28:34.296 --> 28:35.763
<i> shims in the</i>
<i> back to tilt that up?</i>

28:35.798 --> 28:36.997
Because that would
change that, too.

28:37.032 --> 28:38.365
I'd like to get
it up on a lift,

28:38.401 --> 28:40.501
because there is some kind of
misalignments in the floor

28:40.536 --> 28:42.002
that's not like the
other one. I'd just like

28:42.037 --> 28:43.537
<i> to kind of see what's</i>
<i> going on in there just</i>

28:43.572 --> 28:45.272
<i> to see if maybe</i>
<i> it's just a...</i>

28:45.307 --> 28:46.940
It was our first
one and maybe

28:46.976 --> 28:48.742
we may have fumbled a little
bit or what the deal is.

28:48.778 --> 28:50.010
Or maybe they are
missing some shims,

28:50.045 --> 28:51.412
but just kind of like
to see what's going on.

28:51.447 --> 28:53.647
Howard cauliflower,
has spent so much time

28:53.682 --> 28:55.983
on the cf1 projects
that I have to tell you.

28:56.018 --> 28:58.318
<i> Car number zero,</i>
<i> he had a lot of hands on,</i>

28:58.354 --> 29:00.020
<i> to make all of the patterns</i>
<i> of everything</i>

29:00.055 --> 29:02.556
<i> that goes under the dash.</i>
<i> The inner door structures,</i>

29:02.591 --> 29:05.159
<i> basically the entire car,</i>
<i> how it can come apart,</i>

29:05.194 --> 29:06.326
<i> how it goes back together and</i>

29:06.362 --> 29:07.694
<i> how it should be</i>
<i> glued together.</i>

29:07.730 --> 29:10.664
<i>He's got a finger on the pulse</i>
<i> of every last square inch</i>

29:10.699 --> 29:12.933
<i> of this car,</i>
<i> and he's done an awesome job.</i>

29:12.968 --> 29:14.435
So good job there, howard.

29:14.470 --> 29:16.670
What I'm looking at is
I'm looking at the process.

29:16.705 --> 29:18.839
In my mind, I feel like
the other car needs

29:18.874 --> 29:20.574
to be taken
apart at this point.

29:21.010 --> 29:22.843
Put this body on

29:22.878 --> 29:24.845
<i> -the finished frame.</i>
-The finished new chassis.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.747
<i> The one that has</i>
<i> everything on it.</i>

29:26.782 --> 29:28.682
I would hate to start
shimming on this

29:28.717 --> 29:31.618
on this chassis if it's
just a little bit different.

29:31.654 --> 29:33.320
-You know what I'm saying?
-Well, it gives us a chance

29:33.355 --> 29:35.155
as we separate them,

29:35.191 --> 29:37.624
to check what
they've done on this one.

29:37.660 --> 29:41.662
That it goes hand in hand
with what we want them to do.

29:41.697 --> 29:44.097
Because this car, once you get
this stuff kind of lined up

29:44.133 --> 29:45.232
and get it reshimmed,
and stuff,

29:45.267 --> 29:46.667
should be able to be blocked.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.101
-One more primer.
-Done.

29:48.137 --> 29:50.103
Sand the block down
and we're going to painting.

29:50.139 --> 29:52.105
This one's going white
with the red interior?

29:52.141 --> 29:54.741
-White with red. That's--
-like a super classic, cool.

29:54.777 --> 29:56.910
Well, all original 53s

29:56.946 --> 29:58.879
were wimbledon
white and red interior.

29:58.914 --> 30:01.949
Rick's an original.
He's born in 1953, so

30:01.984 --> 30:03.383
-he gets the original.
-Cool.

30:03.419 --> 30:04.885
So he's only two years
older than you?

30:04.920 --> 30:08.322
-Stop.
-[laughs]

30:08.357 --> 30:10.023
I don't think your
math's anywhere...

30:10.059 --> 30:13.527
You know what, I think I just
heard my brain cells popping.

30:13.562 --> 30:15.596
-Do you even do math, kev?
-No.

30:15.631 --> 30:17.831
-Math is hard.
-[laughs]

30:17.867 --> 30:18.999
all right,
guys. Cool. Thanks.

30:19.034 --> 30:20.100
All right, awesome.

30:22.671 --> 30:24.938
A lot of [bleep] around here

30:24.974 --> 30:27.774
for not working on these
cars or not doing enough work.

30:27.810 --> 30:30.110
Let the truth be told, when
he actually is going to help.

30:31.347 --> 30:32.679
[sighs]
he's a handful.

30:32.715 --> 30:34.648
I can't tell you
how excited I am

30:34.683 --> 30:36.617
working on this
project. Finally.

30:36.652 --> 30:38.819
Most don't have the
heart to tell their boss

30:38.854 --> 30:40.554
they are kind of
hard to manage.

30:40.589 --> 30:41.989
And I just don't
have the heart either.

30:42.024 --> 30:43.156
I mean, it's been a while.
We've been

30:43.192 --> 30:45.392
working on it for now,
two years.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.828
But to see it going
along the way it is now

30:47.863 --> 30:49.863
and being this close
to actually having

30:49.899 --> 30:52.332
our first two cars at a show,

30:52.368 --> 30:54.301
it's going to go
crazy after that.

30:54.336 --> 30:56.537
You know, I think kevin's
actually the handful here.

30:56.572 --> 30:58.305
Sometimes his
communication skills

30:58.340 --> 31:00.908
need a little polishing.
You said right?

31:01.810 --> 31:06.213
-Left. Left, right?
-Right, but, left.

31:07.049 --> 31:10.951
-It goes right here.
-Right. Left?

31:10.986 --> 31:12.886
Seriously, like a handful.

31:12.922 --> 31:14.421
Where did dave go?

31:16.959 --> 31:18.292
Dave take my tools?

31:18.327 --> 31:20.694
When dave decides he's
going to work  pct,

31:20.729 --> 31:22.296
it's like the first day
of school, you know,

31:22.331 --> 31:23.931
<i> everyone's kind of</i>
<i> bumping into everybody.</i>

31:23.966 --> 31:25.699
Nobody knows
where their pencil is.

31:25.734 --> 31:27.167
You know,
you can't really... It's like

31:27.202 --> 31:28.235
herding kittens.

31:31.273 --> 31:33.507
-He's going to kill me.
-[laughs]

31:33.976 --> 31:38.412
[clanking sound]

31:41.317 --> 31:43.517
that's all right,
I got a screwdriver.

31:43.552 --> 31:45.819
I don't know why kevin's
really complaining.

31:45.854 --> 31:48.422
I mean, it seems to me that if
you've got more tools than I

31:48.457 --> 31:49.523
and I need to borrow one,

31:49.558 --> 31:50.924
you should leave
your toolbox unlocked.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.459
Yeah, his toolbox
isn't locked.

31:53.228 --> 31:54.761
See those three,
those two drawers

31:54.797 --> 31:56.129
down there, maybe three,

31:56.165 --> 31:57.264
there ain't no
tools in there.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.067
Not for him.

32:00.102 --> 32:02.102
Lookjust hit it
like right here, like this.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.236
There's no keys.

32:04.440 --> 32:05.572
[clanking sound]

32:05.608 --> 32:07.674
there ain't no tools in here.

32:07.710 --> 32:09.309
Just my prive sth.
[bleep]

32:11.213 --> 32:13.080
that's why.

32:13.115 --> 32:14.414
Here he comes.

32:16.318 --> 32:19.086
You know, kevin is not willing
to share his tools with me,

32:19.121 --> 32:21.021
I guess I can find some
tools somewhere else.

32:21.056 --> 32:23.090
I mean, it's not like I
don't own the place.

32:23.125 --> 32:24.691
I mean, I really I guess if I
was going to be down here

32:24.727 --> 32:26.360
all the time, I'd just go
buy some more tools.

32:26.395 --> 32:27.327
I don't really need them,
though.

32:28.864 --> 32:30.364
I'vi hd time
finding the other end of this.

32:30.399 --> 32:34.334
Is it because the plate
in front of it or something?

32:34.370 --> 32:35.602
I can't see the
other side of that--

32:35.638 --> 32:37.404
well if it's easier let's just
take it off the engine then.

32:37.439 --> 32:40.440
That's what I was going
to do because I haven't
been able to find it.

32:40.476 --> 32:41.975
I don't want you making
fun of me when I have

32:42.011 --> 32:43.977
this cable sticking
off the front of here.

32:43.979 --> 32:45.345
Oh, I don't make
fun of you, da

32:45.381 --> 32:47.547
ain. Can I borrowcking
off that sec? Of here.

32:47.583 --> 32:48.882
I don't make fun
of anymore, dude.

32:48.917 --> 32:52.085
-Oh, you don't?
-Or any less.

32:52.955 --> 32:54.688
Okay, I see what you did,
there is

32:55.557 --> 32:56.857
a play on words and stuff.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.291
I got to give
dave some credit.

32:58.327 --> 32:59.459
When he decides to work,

32:59.495 --> 33:01.395
he works hard and
at the end of the day,

33:01.430 --> 33:02.763
it's really nice to
have him in the shop.

33:02.798 --> 33:05.132
I'm going to get the shim out,
okay? Get you ready?

33:05.167 --> 33:07.434
-Yeah.
-Okay.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.155
[dave]<i> one of the things</i>
<i> that the guys have done now</i>

33:12.191 --> 33:13.390
is take the frankenstein car,

33:13.425 --> 33:14.691
which we've
obviously perfected,

33:14.727 --> 33:16.293
made sure everything
opened and closed,

33:16.328 --> 33:17.761
<i> the gaps were perfect.</i>
<i> What we're going to do</i>

33:17.796 --> 33:19.129
<i> to save a little bit</i>
<i> of time on rick's car</i>

33:19.164 --> 33:20.797
is we're going to go ahead
and take it apart.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.766
Therefore, we can make
all of our patterns,

33:22.801 --> 33:23.967
all of our templates,

33:24.003 --> 33:26.403
and we have
a little bit more work

33:26.438 --> 33:27.971
already finished
on this chassis

33:28.007 --> 33:29.873
to actually put rick's
car on that chassis.

33:33.345 --> 33:36.747
[music plays]

33:36.782 --> 33:39.616
[clanking sound]

33:41.754 --> 33:45.422
[whooshing sound]

33:46.225 --> 33:47.424
[clanking sound]

33:48.727 --> 33:51.428
so basically, this was
the first car that we had,

33:51.463 --> 33:53.930
this car had to be
cut into a lot of pieces

33:53.966 --> 33:55.665
and it had to be
glued together.

33:55.701 --> 33:59.436
We went and built the entire
car as far as systems go.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.671
<i> Cooling lines, fuel lines,</i>

34:01.707 --> 34:05.208
<i> special brake lines, special</i>
<i> charcoal canisters, exhaust.</i>

34:05.244 --> 34:07.811
We went ahead and
built all that into this car.

34:07.846 --> 34:08.845
Now that we have

34:08.881 --> 34:10.480
the first body,
whh I call it,

34:10.516 --> 34:12.849
which is really the
second one of ric's list,

34:12.885 --> 34:14.518
which is a seamless body.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.053
We're going to
take this car apart.

34:16.088 --> 34:18.688
Get rick's car on this chassis
because it's completed.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.991
In doing that,
we're also going to

34:21.026 --> 34:23.260
just make a list to
order four of everything.

34:23.295 --> 34:24.895
For right now,
we have four of these cars

34:24.930 --> 34:26.229
that we're building
right out of the gate.

34:26.265 --> 34:27.898
So we're going to kind
of systematically take

34:27.933 --> 34:30.067
this thing apart and
start making notes.

34:30.102 --> 34:31.168
And I'll go from there.

34:31.203 --> 34:33.070
This corvette roadster
has been a dream of mine

34:33.105 --> 34:34.204
for many years,

34:34.239 --> 34:36.106
and it's time for me to
put some skin in the game

34:36.141 --> 34:37.808
-and get dirty.
-Okay, dave,

34:37.843 --> 34:39.609
I'm super excited.
It's a great day.

34:39.645 --> 34:40.811
-You are?
-Yeah.

34:40.846 --> 34:43.613
I see you're working on the
corvette. I'm super excited.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.449
So the goal of this
is to try to take it apart

34:45.484 --> 34:47.918
-in as big pieces as we can.
<i> -Okay.</i>

34:47.953 --> 34:49.953
We don't want to take
apart a ton of stuff. I mean,

34:49.988 --> 34:52.122
steering, a couple of hoses
here and there,

34:52.157 --> 34:53.590
we got some
hoses in the back.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.859
Make sure some
lines are cleared

34:55.894 --> 34:58.061
and we should be able
to really lift this thing off

34:58.097 --> 34:59.563
with not too many problems.

34:59.598 --> 35:00.997
You need stuff
labeled in that?

35:01.033 --> 35:02.265
That way you
can just efficiently,

35:02.301 --> 35:05.202
we can have this thing
apart in a couple of hours.

35:05.237 --> 35:07.471
That's my middle name. Two
hours or less. It's perfect.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.106
<i> Is that...? Really?</i>

35:09.141 --> 35:10.574
How many middle
names do you have?

35:17.716 --> 35:19.116
It's about 12, maybe 13.

35:19.151 --> 35:20.784
-Is that legal?
-Sure.

35:22.154 --> 35:24.988
-[blowing]
-[background banging]

35:25.023 --> 35:27.524
this line can go with
the body. That's undone.

35:27.559 --> 35:28.792
We've removed
all of the hardware

35:28.827 --> 35:30.227
from the mounting points,
and now it's time to

35:30.262 --> 35:33.196
very carefully get this body
off the frame without damage.

35:33.232 --> 35:35.031
How does it feel?
Does it feel heavy?

35:35.067 --> 35:36.933
-No.
-Do you think
we can just pick it up?

35:36.969 --> 35:39.870
I would say four guys
would be smarter than two.

35:39.905 --> 35:41.538
Carbon fiber
is really strong,

35:41.573 --> 35:42.939
but it still could crack

35:42.975 --> 35:45.275
if you apply pressure
in the wrong areas.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.110
I think that we're probably
just going to lift this off

35:47.146 --> 35:48.245
with a bunch of hands.

35:48.814 --> 35:49.946
Hey, so okay, listen.

35:49.982 --> 35:53.049
The support ends
about right here,

35:53.085 --> 35:55.619
so I don't want to
pick up on the nose.

35:55.654 --> 35:56.953
I'm only going
to support this.

35:56.989 --> 35:58.088
I'm not going to be lifting.

35:58.123 --> 35:59.756
We're going to go. All
right. Nice and easy, okay?

35:59.791 --> 36:02.359
One, two, three. Okay, we're
good. That was a shifter.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.495
Up. Good. Good.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.397
Okay, everybody kind of walk,
we've got,

36:07.432 --> 36:09.266
if you have a problem,
just speak up.

36:13.205 --> 36:14.638
Okay, dave, you want
to line up to that first.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.439
Line up one side,
just line yours up.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.808
Okay, just go ahead
and set it down
on that corner.

36:18.844 --> 36:19.943
We need to make sure that

36:19.978 --> 36:21.845
everything is
set in correctly.

36:21.880 --> 36:25.081
We don't want this thing
to warp or bend in any way.

36:26.418 --> 36:29.152
This way. Come towards me.
There you go. Down.

36:29.188 --> 36:31.087
I think yours is
too far right now.

36:31.123 --> 36:32.889
To start with.
Well, you got it.

36:32.925 --> 36:34.090
There you go. Good.

36:37.796 --> 36:39.329
Far out.

36:39.364 --> 36:40.931
[kevin]<i> I'm glad that went</i>
<i> really smooth,</i>

36:40.966 --> 36:42.766
<i> we're this much</i>
<i> closer to finishing.</i>

36:42.801 --> 36:44.234
So now we're going
to take this chassis

36:44.269 --> 36:45.669
and we're going to
reverse engineer it so

36:45.704 --> 36:47.204
we can make many
of these chassis.

36:47.239 --> 36:49.105
We're going to have
everything lined out

36:49.141 --> 36:50.874
all the way to fuel
and brake lines.

36:50.909 --> 36:52.375
Nothing is completed yet,

36:52.411 --> 36:54.477
but we're a lot further
along by separating

36:54.513 --> 36:55.812
<i> the frankenstein body off</i>

36:55.847 --> 36:57.948
<i> of the first</i>
<i> production chassis.</i>

36:57.983 --> 36:59.983
We're making notes of
everything that has to happen

37:00.018 --> 37:01.618
with all the rest
of the chassis, like

37:01.653 --> 37:03.720
these tabs for

37:03.755 --> 37:07.857
the fender well liners and
stuff you see off that side.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.459
<i> Got some brake lines</i>
<i> we have to make from</i>

37:09.494 --> 37:11.494
<i> the bulkhead</i>
<i> up to our master.</i>

37:11.530 --> 37:14.731
We should be able to
take a template off of this

37:14.766 --> 37:17.000
on the next chassis, be
able to lay the template up,

37:17.035 --> 37:19.636
mark where the new ones,
the tabs go, weld them on.

37:19.671 --> 37:22.572
We're done. We don't
have to prefit everything.

37:22.608 --> 37:25.442
And then, yes,
put that body back on here.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.644
Bolt it down,
double check everything.

37:27.679 --> 37:28.712
Make sure it's good.

37:29.648 --> 37:31.181
Pull it back
off and paint it.

37:32.751 --> 37:33.783
Pretty much like that.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.953
[drilling sound]

37:36.989 --> 37:39.256
we've made a ton of
progress on the cf1.

37:39.291 --> 37:41.591
Our client, rick, wants to
check out what we've done.

37:41.627 --> 37:43.760
We are getting a lot closer.

37:43.795 --> 37:46.229
We're waiting on dave and
waiting on dave, and then

37:46.265 --> 37:48.231
he's not going to make it.

37:48.267 --> 37:49.866
Really, I'm going
to shoot this with kev.

37:49.901 --> 37:51.401
-Are you serious?
-In fact,

37:51.436 --> 37:54.104
we're getting so close.
It's in the body shop.

37:54.139 --> 37:56.206
-I guess.
-Well, what do you think?

37:56.241 --> 37:57.274
Well...

37:59.678 --> 38:01.211
[dave]
<i> today is a huge day for us,</i>

38:01.246 --> 38:03.380
rick cox is coming by to
check out car number one

38:03.415 --> 38:06.049
of our cf1 roadsters
before it goes over to paint.

38:06.084 --> 38:07.417
All right, rick.
[clapping hands]

38:07.452 --> 38:08.551
-wow.
-It has been

38:08.587 --> 38:10.186
a long time coming.

38:10.222 --> 38:11.988
I've seen the nditions
that dave's done

38:12.024 --> 38:15.925
and what I really want to see

38:18.430 --> 38:20.864
<i>  n, w eshear</i>
afiar theyy
likebuilt corvettes 53.

38:20.899 --> 38:24.634
And it's really the first
corvette I ever wanted. But

38:24.670 --> 38:27.437
I've driven original
53s and they don't drive.

38:27.472 --> 38:29.839
You don't really
see all the nuances

38:29.875 --> 38:31.841
of a body when

38:31.877 --> 38:34.244
you're looking at
a drawing versus

38:34.279 --> 38:36.246
when you get to see it
and you touch it.

38:36.281 --> 38:38.048
Put your hands on it.
And that to me,

38:38.083 --> 38:39.949
is what's exciting. That's
what I want to see today.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.051
What do you think?

38:41.086 --> 38:43.153
Well, I don't know.
I got hair standing up

38:43.188 --> 38:45.455
in the back of my head right
now, dude, I'm telling you.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.997
What I really like about it,
the first one he had

38:54.032 --> 38:55.332
<i> -was really low.</i>
<i> -I agreed.</i>

38:55.367 --> 38:56.766
And this is a little higher,
so

38:56.802 --> 38:58.601
it kind of looks
more like a corvette.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.136
I do love the lines.

39:00.172 --> 39:01.671
<i> Oh my god. What a difference.</i>

39:01.707 --> 39:04.174
<i> Will this have a bubble</i>
<i> over it? Seriously?</i>

39:04.209 --> 39:06.242
Yep. Yep, that's the
way that it's going to be,

39:06.278 --> 39:07.744
and it'll be lighted
on the inside.

39:07.779 --> 39:09.512
-Exhaust?
-The exhaust comes out here.

39:09.548 --> 39:11.214
-Chrome?
-All chrome

39:11.249 --> 39:13.316
<i> and the tail lights are</i>
<i> getting cut right now.</i>

39:13.352 --> 39:15.385
-Really?
-Yeah. Out of acrylic,

39:15.420 --> 39:16.553
and then we'll
paint them red.

39:16.588 --> 39:18.054
And then this
side's really cool.

39:18.090 --> 39:20.824
This is actually where you
put the gas in.

39:20.859 --> 39:23.827
That is amazing.
That is cooler than anything.

39:23.862 --> 39:27.330
The car, the lines,
everything. They're beautiful.

39:27.366 --> 39:28.865
[kevin]<i> this is the</i>
<i> actual windshield.</i>

39:28.900 --> 39:30.767
<i> It'll be framed</i>
<i> and then glued in.</i>

39:30.802 --> 39:32.936
-Check out the front.
-I got to see this.

39:32.971 --> 39:35.839
The headlights are hids,
so they'll be super bright.

39:35.874 --> 39:38.041
And then you have
a daytime running on the top.

39:38.076 --> 39:40.977
Really? They'll
bubble like that. Really?

39:41.012 --> 39:42.879
<i> Because the original</i>
<i> had the wire.</i>

39:42.914 --> 39:44.214
-Yep, exactly.
-And this looks like it has

39:44.249 --> 39:45.882
a wire in it. So
you kind of mixed?

39:45.917 --> 39:47.317
-Yeah.
-That is killer.

39:47.352 --> 39:49.119
This is a first year, so

39:49.154 --> 39:52.255
<i> you know, they had the teeth.</i>
<i> And you've taken that out.</i>

39:52.290 --> 39:53.857
-Yup.
-This is better.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.992
It actually looks like it's
smiling instead of growling.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.961
-Yup. That's a stock.
-Oh, really? Okay.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.929
We basically just cut
it back a little bit and

39:59.965 --> 40:01.765
took all the notches out
where the teeth normally go.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.299
Right. And that
all will be chromed.

40:03.335 --> 40:05.235
Yep,
everything will be chromed.

40:05.270 --> 40:07.937
-Wow. Dude, you're killing it.
-It's going to be exciting.

40:07.973 --> 40:09.205
You killed it.

40:09.241 --> 40:11.975
<i> The car is</i>
<i> absolutely amazing.</i>

40:12.010 --> 40:13.777
I can picture in my head

40:13.812 --> 40:16.212
exactly how it's
going to look painted,

40:16.248 --> 40:19.149
<i> with the interior, it's going</i>
<i> to be an amazing car.</i>

40:19.184 --> 40:20.316
I'm really excited.

40:20.352 --> 40:21.684
You tell me there's
some things here.

40:21.720 --> 40:22.952
I haven't seen this

40:22.988 --> 40:24.888
that are different
from the original right?

40:26.224 --> 40:29.692
It's kind of like, you know,
when I designed this car.

40:29.728 --> 40:32.629
Yeah, I designed this
and I did that.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.164
I designed it

40:34.199 --> 40:35.932
like the original.
It's just smoother.

40:35.967 --> 40:38.968
So when dave
sent me that picture,

40:39.004 --> 40:40.670
he was just putting
down your thoughts?

40:40.705 --> 40:42.539
Okay, this has to be
between us.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.207
-Oh, all right.
-That's how it went.

40:44.242 --> 40:46.075
All right. I'm with you.
I'm with you.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.912
Did you see one one of
my design things over here?

40:48.947 --> 40:50.613
I got all this
stuff going on.

40:50.649 --> 40:51.948
And the design that I did is

40:51.983 --> 40:53.183
I just like to play off
the original,

40:53.218 --> 40:55.185
just make it look th
does that make sense?

40:55.220 --> 40:57.253
That does make sense
because you're amazing.

40:57.289 --> 40:58.488
-Yeah.
-You're a genius.

40:58.523 --> 41:00.223
Yeah, I know.
I get that all the time.

41:00.258 --> 41:01.491
Kevin comes up
with these thoughts.

41:01.526 --> 41:02.859
I don't know where
he comes up with them.

41:02.894 --> 41:04.194
-I got to tell you something.
-All right.

41:04.229 --> 41:05.795
It was really dave's design.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.197
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

41:07.232 --> 41:08.665
-You told me it was you.
-I know.

41:08.700 --> 41:11.968
But I just need to
come clean because if

41:12.003 --> 41:13.803
if I keep the charades up,
it's going to cost a lot more.

41:13.839 --> 41:15.205
-He's going to see it?
-[laughs]

41:15.240 --> 41:16.806
he's going to see it?
Yeah, he's going to see it.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.174
And both of us are
going to be in trouble

41:18.210 --> 41:19.809
-because I bought it.
-Yeah.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.211
[laughs]

41:21.246 --> 41:22.412
he's is going to kill me.

41:22.447 --> 41:23.580
You're going to show me
the engine?

41:23.615 --> 41:26.115
-Oh, 100%.
<i> -Wow.</i>

41:26.151 --> 41:28.518
[kevin]<i> it's all going</i>
<i> to be decked out.</i>

41:28.553 --> 41:31.554
<i> Shined, chromed, it's just</i>
<i> going to look amazing.</i>

41:31.590 --> 41:34.524
It's going to look amazing.
This is one of the challenges

41:34.559 --> 41:36.559
that we had with the car.

41:36.595 --> 41:40.096
Because the design called
for us to kind of section it,

41:40.131 --> 41:42.332
so you lose all this height.
So we had to

41:42.367 --> 41:44.501
<i> really watch our height</i>
<i> through here, you know,</i>

41:44.536 --> 41:45.635
to clear the
build. That's why

41:45.670 --> 41:47.103
these are a
little bit shorter.

41:47.138 --> 41:48.438
But like you said,
it's just going to be--

41:48.473 --> 41:50.373
-I think it looks amazing.
-It's going to be crazy.

41:50.408 --> 41:51.708
And there's way
more horsepower

41:51.743 --> 41:53.176
-than you'll ever need.
-Oh, I bet.

41:53.211 --> 41:56.579
-Wow. This is numero uno.
-[laughs]

41:56.615 --> 42:00.116
-yeah, number one.
-And, jones?

42:00.151 --> 42:01.684
Yeah, he's number two.

42:01.720 --> 42:04.487
Number two, you're
going to get number two.

42:04.523 --> 42:06.856
I have number one.

42:06.892 --> 42:08.057
-Let's close this.
-All right.

42:08.093 --> 42:11.861
And I got something else to
show you while you're here.

42:14.366 --> 42:17.667
Look at this
super vinyl white.

42:19.170 --> 42:20.503
-Okay.
-I know a little bit

42:20.539 --> 42:23.373
about paint, I know a little
bit less about upholstery.

42:23.408 --> 42:25.642
It's so awesome, right?
It's called no strings white.

42:25.677 --> 42:26.776
-No strings.
-It's actually

42:26.811 --> 42:29.746
in the akzonoble line.
It's an amazing white.

42:29.781 --> 42:31.014
-It looks awesome.
-So really,

42:31.049 --> 42:32.482
at the end of the day,
I'm just going to bs

42:32.517 --> 42:34.484
my way through this.
And it normally works.

42:34.519 --> 42:35.785
-That's awesome.
-What I want you to do

42:35.820 --> 42:37.253
is I want you. Let's
go outside and see

42:37.289 --> 42:38.688
how amazing these
colors look in the sun.

42:38.723 --> 42:40.590
Let's do that.

42:40.625 --> 42:45.528
Look at this. Look at this
color combo in the sun.

42:45.564 --> 42:48.031
Wow, that's going
to be amazing, dude.

42:48.066 --> 42:50.600
Look at the contrast.
That's amazing.

42:50.635 --> 42:52.168
And how clean the white is.

42:52.203 --> 42:53.303
Dude,
this is going to be a killer.

42:53.338 --> 42:55.371
Mine will be number one.
It will still be

42:55.407 --> 42:56.973
the only car like it.

42:57.008 --> 43:00.610
It will still be the number
one car that's made.

43:00.645 --> 43:02.412
And it really pays
homage to the first one.

43:02.447 --> 43:04.781
-It does.
-They only sold them

43:04.816 --> 43:06.082
-in white, right?
-That was it, dude.

43:06.117 --> 43:07.317
Mine is number one.

43:07.352 --> 43:08.885
That's what
I'm excited about.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.353
And I think that's
pretty darn cool.

43:10.388 --> 43:12.255
-I like it. I like it.
-I do like it.

43:12.290 --> 43:14.791
I'm so ecstatic that he's
been able to come down here,

43:14.826 --> 43:17.093
<i> check out the car,</i>
<i> and he's so excited about it.</i>

43:17.128 --> 43:18.361
That makes me excited,

43:18.396 --> 43:20.630
and to have him as
car owner number one.

43:20.665 --> 43:21.965
Now that's perfect.
