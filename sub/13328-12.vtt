WEBVTT

00:16.417 --> 00:18.792
( theme music playing )

00:26.625 --> 00:28.041
( whistles )

00:52.291 --> 00:54.125
Man:
Well, needless to say,

00:54.125 --> 00:56.041
people are still talking
about me in Barcelona.

00:56.041 --> 00:57.959
( Murray laughing )
I bet they are.

00:57.959 --> 01:00.792
Man: Yeah.
Oh, hey, guys.
Come in.

01:00.792 --> 01:03.125
Murray:
Good timing.

01:04.375 --> 01:06.125
All right,
let's get started.

01:06.125 --> 01:08.291
Band meeting, Jemaine.

01:08.291 --> 01:09.625
Yes.
Bret?

01:09.625 --> 01:11.417
Yeah.
Murray, present.

01:11.417 --> 01:13.959
And Todd.
Present.

01:13.959 --> 01:15.250
Good,
very professional.

01:15.250 --> 01:17.125
( whispering )
Murray, who's this guy?

01:17.125 --> 01:20.583
Murray: Eh?
Who's this guy
that's on my chair?

01:20.583 --> 01:22.083
I'm getting to that,
Jemaine, all right?

01:22.083 --> 01:24.000
That's in the agenda
under Todd.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.500
All right?
Just stop jumping the gun.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.166
You're always trying
to get ahead of things.

01:28.166 --> 01:31.667
Item one: Todd.
He's the new band member.

01:31.667 --> 01:33.500
Hi.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.000
Okay, item two,

01:35.000 --> 01:37.667
Interview
with "Rolling Stones."

01:37.667 --> 01:39.166
Now I wasn't sure
whether that was

01:39.166 --> 01:40.834
the magazine
or the band.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.875
I've heard from both,
I've got a no from the band--

01:42.875 --> 01:46.250
Murray, what do you mean
new band member?
Well, that's item one.

01:46.250 --> 01:48.500
What are you
talking about, Bret?
We're on to item two now,

01:48.500 --> 01:50.500
"Interview confusion."
Do you want me to go
back to item one?

01:50.500 --> 01:53.667
Yeah, go back to item one.
Yeah?  Okay.

01:53.667 --> 01:56.041
( exhaling )

01:56.041 --> 01:58.417
Item one: Todd.

01:58.417 --> 02:00.000
Yeah, he's the new
band member.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.041
Hi.

02:01.041 --> 02:03.667
Hi.
Right.
Item two--

02:03.667 --> 02:05.667
I didn't know
we were looking
for a new band member.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.917
Well, we weren't, Bret.
But then I just found one.

02:07.917 --> 02:10.792
Todd, just show them
what you showed me
yesterday at the dentist.

02:10.792 --> 02:13.041
Sure.

02:13.041 --> 02:15.708
( drumming )

02:22.875 --> 02:24.542
Whoa!

02:26.792 --> 02:29.000
Even better than yesterday.
You could see all the details

02:29.000 --> 02:30.625
when your fingers
bounce off the skins.

02:30.625 --> 02:33.625
Pigskin, is it?
Really good.

02:33.625 --> 02:35.291
I'll just tell you
straight up

02:35.291 --> 02:38.542
that all I'm really interested
in is kicking some grooves,

02:38.542 --> 02:40.041
banging some tunes,

02:40.041 --> 02:42.708
I don't know,
just basically
getting it on.

02:42.708 --> 02:44.333
Let me just
get that down.

02:44.333 --> 02:45.959
Getting down.
Murray.

02:45.959 --> 02:49.417
Can we have a private
band meeting, please?
Private band meeting?

02:49.417 --> 02:51.875
Yeah, can we go
somewhere else and have
a private band meeting?

02:51.875 --> 02:54.583
Okay, all right, sure.

02:55.959 --> 02:58.333
Come on, Todd, we're having
a private  band meeting.

02:58.333 --> 03:00.917
No, I mean
without Todd.

03:02.083 --> 03:04.166
Murray, what's this?
We turn up and there's

03:04.166 --> 03:05.583
some other guy
in the band apparently.

03:05.583 --> 03:08.792
Yeah, what?
You know, we've
got to discuss it.

03:08.792 --> 03:12.250
This is a decision I made
as a band manager,
all right?

03:12.250 --> 03:14.083
You guys have got
to trust me sometimes.

03:14.083 --> 03:16.083
Sometimes I have
good ideas.
When?

03:16.083 --> 03:19.291
Like that time I saw you
for the first time onstage.

03:19.291 --> 03:21.333
I said "Face the front,"
and you did.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.083
We've never looked back
since, have we?

03:23.083 --> 03:24.959
Still not sure about that.
You've got to go in there

03:24.959 --> 03:27.667
and you've got to tell Todd
he's not in the band.

03:27.667 --> 03:29.792
It's too late,
Jemaine, all right?

03:29.792 --> 03:31.208
I think I promised him.

03:31.208 --> 03:33.041
I'd just been given
nitrous oxide.

03:33.041 --> 03:35.625
I was at the dentist.
I didn't know what I was
talking about.

03:35.625 --> 03:37.291
I think I'm going
to his brother's wedding.

03:37.291 --> 03:40.041
All I want you guys
to do is just give him
a chance, all right?

03:40.041 --> 03:43.208
He knows his stuff.
Murray, we don't
need a bongo player.

03:43.208 --> 03:45.125
Have you seen him
on the bongos?
Yes.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.291
Yeah? Is he any good?

03:48.291 --> 03:49.792
Of course he's good.
He's great!

03:49.792 --> 03:51.834
Isn't he? Is he?
He's all right.

03:51.834 --> 03:53.959
He's okay.
Yeah, well, you can
say that again.

03:53.959 --> 03:55.708
And now there's
three of you in a band.

03:55.708 --> 03:58.667
You're like a proper band.
You're like the Policemen.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.959
Yeah, but you can't add members
to our band willy-nilly.

04:00.959 --> 04:03.417
Look, guys, I had to.
No one else was gonna do it.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.875
You guys weren't
gonna come up with
that idea, were you?

04:05.875 --> 04:08.583
Murray, I'm on a...

04:08.583 --> 04:10.208
call here with
the Secretary of State.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.959
Could you-- how much
longer are you gonna be?

04:11.959 --> 04:15.166
Oh, not much longer, Greg.
Sorry. Okay?

04:15.166 --> 04:18.500
Look, all I want you to do
is give Todd a chance.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.667
Like the song.
Which song?

04:21.667 --> 04:23.041
The John Lennon one,
you know.

04:23.041 --> 04:25.667
"Give Peace a Chance."
Give Pete  a Chance.

04:25.667 --> 04:27.125
Okay?

04:27.125 --> 04:29.500
Peace.
Yeah.

04:32.291 --> 04:34.458
( drumming )

04:46.250 --> 04:48.125
( sighs )
Good, well--

04:48.125 --> 04:49.667
Wow.
Yeah.

04:49.667 --> 04:51.792
But, um, not every song

04:51.792 --> 04:53.375
should end
with a bongo solo.

04:53.375 --> 04:56.375
Sure, no problem.
Is that cool?

04:58.708 --> 05:01.417
Maybe he could--
Maybe just a little solo...

05:01.417 --> 05:03.083
You could start off with--
...in the middle.

05:03.083 --> 05:05.125
Yeah, and we'll have
a little solo in the middle.

05:05.125 --> 05:07.500
Great.
Hey, you know what?

05:07.500 --> 05:09.208
Can we try a song
that I wrote real quick?

05:09.208 --> 05:10.750
Mm-hmm.
No.

05:10.750 --> 05:13.417
All you guys'll do,
you'll put your
guitars and bass down

05:13.417 --> 05:14.959
and you just
go, "Arf! Arf!"

05:14.959 --> 05:17.208
in the background,
like dogs.

05:17.208 --> 05:18.875
Like bad dogs.
Arf! Arf!

05:18.875 --> 05:21.208
Mmm, I don't--
You get to dance
and go "Arf, arf"

05:21.208 --> 05:24.000
while I'm playing-- Arf arf.
I'm not sure about one.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.875
You don't like dancing?
I like dancing, I just--

05:25.875 --> 05:27.834
You don't--
you don't like dancing.

05:27.834 --> 05:29.417
I dance all the time.
Really?

05:29.417 --> 05:31.375
Yeah, I dance
at parties.

05:31.375 --> 05:33.542
I dance when I'm angry.
I dance--

05:33.542 --> 05:35.834
When you're angry?
Who dances when
they're angry?

05:35.834 --> 05:38.667
I guess that's about it.
I've never seen you dance
when you're angry.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.917
Guys!
Focus, guys.

05:40.917 --> 05:42.708
Well,
I dance often.

05:42.708 --> 05:44.750
Let's kick into this one.
Am I right?

05:44.750 --> 05:46.208
Arf, arf!

05:46.208 --> 05:47.750
Uh, the thing is,

05:47.750 --> 05:50.625
uh, we've been
practicing for
56 minutes and...

05:50.625 --> 05:52.708
that's how long
we practice for.

05:52.708 --> 05:55.333
( men chattering )

05:55.333 --> 05:56.917
Hey, guys!
Hi, Mel.

05:56.917 --> 05:59.125
Whoa-ho!
What are the chances?

05:59.125 --> 06:00.667
We're always
bumping into each other.

06:00.667 --> 06:03.583
About one in one.
Ha ha!

06:03.583 --> 06:05.208
Hey.
Oh, hi, my name's Mel.
I don't think we've met.

06:05.208 --> 06:07.625
I'm Todd.
Nice to meet you.
Todd's a new band member.

06:07.625 --> 06:10.250
What?
I'm the third
Conchord.

06:10.250 --> 06:11.500
Yeah.
But...

06:11.500 --> 06:13.500
Why would you
even have that--
Oh!

06:13.500 --> 06:15.750
You're the fan,
right?
Yeah.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.834
Murray told me
all about you.

06:17.834 --> 06:20.917
Actually, he, um,
neglected to tell me
what a hottie you are.

06:20.917 --> 06:22.375
Stop it.

06:22.375 --> 06:25.000
Looks like
the race is on.
( giggles )

06:25.000 --> 06:28.291
Gentlemen, start
your engines.

06:28.291 --> 06:29.708
Vroom!

06:29.708 --> 06:31.583
Vroom!
Oh my God.

06:31.583 --> 06:33.792
( giggling )
Am I right?

06:34.792 --> 06:36.667
What do you play,
Todd?

06:36.667 --> 06:38.500
I'll give you
a clue.

06:39.750 --> 06:41.834
The bongos.
Oh!

06:41.834 --> 06:44.125
Rhythmic.
Yeah, tribal.

06:44.125 --> 06:47.500
Powerful.
Very physical, if you
know what I mean.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.250
Oh, I know what
you mean, Todd.

06:49.250 --> 06:51.417
We got to go.
Good to see you.

06:51.417 --> 06:53.333
Oh, all right, bye.
See you later, Mel.

06:53.333 --> 06:54.875
Bye, guys.

06:54.875 --> 06:57.208
Sweet dreams, baby.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.000
( giggles )

07:02.458 --> 07:04.291
So what's she like?

07:04.291 --> 07:06.291
She's a maniac.

07:06.291 --> 07:07.959
In the sack?
Really?

07:07.959 --> 07:09.667
No.
What?

07:09.667 --> 07:11.166
You guys have both
done her, right?

07:11.166 --> 07:13.708
Oh, no.
Oh, I thought you had
a threesome with her.

07:13.708 --> 07:15.500
No,
she's just a fan.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.083
Never had
a threesome with her.

07:17.083 --> 07:19.417
Well, if you two homo sapiens
aren't gonna make the move,

07:19.417 --> 07:21.166
guess what?
I'm gonna.

07:21.166 --> 07:22.667
I'm definitely
gonna do it with her.

07:22.667 --> 07:24.166
Oh no,
she's married.

07:24.166 --> 07:27.208
Who cares?
I'm a bongo player
in a band.

07:27.208 --> 07:28.667
She's hot to trot.

07:28.667 --> 07:30.792
I'm gonna make it happen.
I'm gonna give it to her.

07:30.792 --> 07:32.834
Am I right?
Damn.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.875
Hey, am I right?

07:34.875 --> 07:36.500
I don't know.
Am I right?

07:36.500 --> 07:39.542
Possibly.
Possibly? I'm right.

07:45.125 --> 07:47.417
( crowd shouting, hooting )

08:00.667 --> 08:04.041
( cheering, shouting )

08:07.000 --> 08:09.291
Well, he did all right.
Was like a 10-minute solo.

08:09.291 --> 08:12.083
I know!
He's the new guy
in the band.

08:12.083 --> 08:13.542
Wow, amazing.

08:13.542 --> 08:16.834
What a gig. I declare this
the best Conchords gig ever.

08:16.834 --> 08:18.291
Murray, you have
to fire Todd.

08:18.291 --> 08:20.375
Fire Todd?!
Keep your voice down.
What do you mean?

08:20.375 --> 08:23.375
He might hear you.
He's the best thing that's
happened to this band.

08:23.375 --> 08:26.500
Why do you want
to get rid of him?
Bret, tell him.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.959
He's not cool.
Yes, Bret's right.

08:28.959 --> 08:31.458
He's not cool like us.
We're cool.

08:31.458 --> 08:32.834
He's way cool!

08:32.834 --> 08:34.625
He's cooler than
both of you put together.

08:34.625 --> 08:37.500
Go! Go! Go! Go!
( all cheering )

08:37.500 --> 08:40.250
Look at him with
all his friends.
They're following him.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.625
He's like
the Pied Piper of cool.

08:42.625 --> 08:44.750
Pied Piper was a good
musician, wasn't he?

08:44.750 --> 08:46.625
He was cool.
He wasn't cool.

08:46.625 --> 08:50.375
Yes, he was.
He took all those
kids into a cave.

08:50.375 --> 08:52.542
No, before that phase,
when just the rats
followed him--

08:52.542 --> 08:55.291
Listen, the Pied Piper's
not cool and Todd's not cool.

08:55.291 --> 08:57.500
Hey, guys.
What's up?

08:57.500 --> 08:59.125
I thought that went
pretty well, huh?

08:59.125 --> 09:00.750
Yeah, went-- went okay.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.166
There was maybe
one problem though.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.917
And that is, uh--
Your solos were too long?

09:04.917 --> 09:06.792
No no no,
the band name is too long.

09:08.083 --> 09:09.583
You have the too long
part right,

09:09.583 --> 09:11.125
but it's not my solo.
It's the band name.

09:11.125 --> 09:13.291
What is it?
Flight of the Con--

09:13.291 --> 09:15.792
Con-- Conchords--
Blah blah blah.

09:15.792 --> 09:17.959
Too long,
too boring.

09:17.959 --> 09:19.750
We need something
that'll stick.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.125
I think I got it.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.750
Get ready...
The Crazy Dogggz.

09:23.750 --> 09:26.333
Three Gs and a Z.

09:26.333 --> 09:29.000
I like it.
You guys are crazy,
you're like dogs.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.875
We're like,
yeah, crazy dogs.

09:30.875 --> 09:33.125
We all are.
Including you.
Murray: Me?

09:33.125 --> 09:34.667
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, I don't
know, but...

09:34.667 --> 09:37.000
Yeah, oh, I know.
Yeah? Awesome.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.417
Can I get you a drink, Todd?
I'd love one.

09:39.417 --> 09:41.000
I don't want that drink,
but I'll take a drink.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.834
Yeah, love a drink.
Murray: Yeah?

09:47.959 --> 09:49.667
Okay, I'm just gonna
go over there and say,

09:49.667 --> 09:51.125
"Dear Todd,
thank you very much,

09:51.125 --> 09:52.875
but you can't be
in the band anymore."

09:52.875 --> 09:54.834
Mmm. I don't think
you should do it, man.

09:54.834 --> 09:56.875
You're too
easily offended.

09:56.875 --> 09:59.041
I can't believe
you just said that.

09:59.041 --> 10:00.667
Look, I'm gonna do it.

10:01.583 --> 10:03.333
All right, yeah,
you better do it.

10:03.333 --> 10:06.166
"Dear Todd."
Make sure you say
"Dear Todd."

10:15.792 --> 10:17.500
( shouting )

10:19.041 --> 10:21.500
( grunting )

10:38.542 --> 10:40.166
( sighs )
Hey, how'd it go?

10:40.166 --> 10:42.083
Bad. Bad.

10:42.083 --> 10:44.208
I told him he was fired,
he pushed me.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.708
Ooh.
Yeah.

10:45.708 --> 10:47.375
Then he said that
you should be fired

10:47.375 --> 10:48.917
because you're the one
holding us back.

10:48.917 --> 10:50.875
That's what he said.
What'd you say to that?

10:50.875 --> 10:53.500
Well, I hit him.
You know, he can't say that.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.500
You hit him?
Yeah, I hit him.
Hit him in the face.

10:55.500 --> 10:58.291
In the face?
Yeah, hit--
hit him right in the face.

10:58.291 --> 11:01.291
Wow.
Yeah, I'm not gonna
let him talk about
you like that.

11:01.291 --> 11:02.917
Thanks, man.
Yeah.

11:02.917 --> 11:04.542
Well, we got rid of him.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.041
Mmm.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.917
What do you mean,
"mmm"?

11:09.917 --> 11:11.000
I mean... no.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.291
Well?
Is he fired or not?

11:13.291 --> 11:15.458
Well, you see,
while I had him in a headlock,

11:15.458 --> 11:18.583
he sort of explained
why he thought you
shouldn't be in the band.

11:18.583 --> 11:20.500
And after a while
it kind of made sense.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.542
You were only over there
for like 20 seconds.

11:22.542 --> 11:24.667
Yeah, after about 20 seconds
it kind of made sense.

11:24.667 --> 11:27.291
It's hard to fire a guy
who's in a headlock.

11:27.291 --> 11:30.291
It's easy for me
to fire you, Bret,
because you're my friend.

11:30.291 --> 11:31.583
So what are you saying?
You're fired, Bret.

11:31.583 --> 11:35.417
I'm  fired?
Yeah.

11:35.417 --> 11:37.750
But you can't do that--
Listen, we'll talk
about it later.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.542
I've gotta go
to band practice now.

11:39.542 --> 11:41.250
Todd's very strict.

11:44.250 --> 11:45.875
Flup!

11:45.875 --> 11:48.917

music playing )

13:07.291 --> 13:09.333
( music stops )

13:22.083 --> 13:25.458
Okay, man. More enthusiasm
this time, all right?
( drum machine thumping )

13:25.458 --> 13:26.583
It's "The Doggy Bounce."

13:26.583 --> 13:28.458
Todd, how about you
get down on all fours

13:28.458 --> 13:30.208
and wag your tail like
you just can't fail

13:30.208 --> 13:32.125
and I'll just play
bass, huh?

13:32.125 --> 13:33.792
What?
It's "The Doggy Bounce."

13:33.792 --> 13:35.500
You have to do
"The Doggy Bounce" bounce.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.917
It's a phenomena.
( sighs )

13:36.917 --> 13:38.834
Okay? Now, let's
count this shit off.

There is no guitar
in this song, all right?

13:56.250 --> 13:57.917
There's
no guitar, okay?

13:57.917 --> 14:00.417

No, not even a little bit.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.291
So don't do that.
Okay.

14:21.291 --> 14:23.166
Thank you.
Thank you.
Sure.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.291

14:25.291 --> 14:26.750
Todd, I don't like
this kind of music.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.917
Oh, you don't like
this kind of music?

14:28.917 --> 14:30.750
I didn't know that.
It's stupid dance music.

14:30.750 --> 14:33.291

So why do you
care about the music?
Well...

14:39.667 --> 14:41.375
Do you guys need
to borrow my amp?

14:41.375 --> 14:44.208
Bret, you're pathetic, man.
We don't need a roadie, okay?

14:44.208 --> 14:46.500
I could carry
your bongos.
My what?

14:46.500 --> 14:49.083
No one's touching my bongos.
You know that.

14:49.083 --> 14:51.375
Do you need someone to carry
your guitar, Jemaine?

14:51.375 --> 14:54.667
Well, I don't really
need you to, Bret.

14:54.667 --> 14:56.792
Okay.

14:56.792 --> 14:58.625
I get it.

14:58.625 --> 15:00.792
Not needed.

15:00.792 --> 15:04.542
You know what?
We got to rock out "The Doggy
Bounce" this Saturday night.

15:04.542 --> 15:06.291
It's not ready.
It's totally ready.

15:06.291 --> 15:08.125
It's not ready, Todd.

15:09.792 --> 15:11.708
All right, you're right.
Let's get it perfect.

15:11.708 --> 15:14.291
Yeah, let's get it perfect
and then we'll maybe do it
another time.

15:14.291 --> 15:15.917
Yeah, am I right?

15:15.917 --> 15:17.291
Yes.

15:21.333 --> 15:25.000
Two of you?
But that's going backwards.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.667
I thought we had a proper
three-person band.

15:27.667 --> 15:28.875
That's what you agreed on.

15:28.875 --> 15:30.458
Jemaine and Todd,
they fired me.

15:30.458 --> 15:32.375
So I started a new band.
This is Demetri.

15:32.375 --> 15:34.333
Hey.
I met him running.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.583
Look, I don't think
Jemaine can fire you.

15:36.583 --> 15:38.500
They need my authorization,
don't you?

15:38.500 --> 15:40.000
It's too late.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.667
I'm pretty sure you need
my authorization for firing
and hiring.

15:42.667 --> 15:45.959
Don't you think?
I mean, what am I doing?

15:45.959 --> 15:48.083
I'll check on that.

15:48.083 --> 15:50.083
"Authorization needed...

15:50.083 --> 15:53.834
Bret kicked out...
question mark."

15:56.166 --> 15:58.083
Okay.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.250
So, Demetri, what exactly
is this thing?

16:00.250 --> 16:02.041
It's a guitboard.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.708
No, man, keytar.
Keytar.

16:03.708 --> 16:05.500
Yeah, he took the wrong
parts of the words.
A keytar.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.542
It's half keyboard
and half guitar.

16:07.542 --> 16:09.458
So is a guitar
or a keyboard?

16:09.458 --> 16:12.542
Exactly.
It's the best of both worlds.

16:12.542 --> 16:15.959
So it starts out as a keyboard
and ends kind of as a guitar.

16:15.959 --> 16:17.875
I don't like it.
It's weird.

16:17.875 --> 16:19.125
It's not
the right shape.

16:19.125 --> 16:21.708
Play him something.
Sure.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.542
Could you
hold that please?
Mm-hmm.

16:26.542 --> 16:29.041
( playing notes )

16:30.959 --> 16:33.375
No, don't like it.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.291
Ugh, no.
Weird.

16:35.291 --> 16:38.208
( continues playing )

16:38.208 --> 16:40.208
Oh, that bit's good.

16:41.708 --> 16:44.083
( stops playing )
Who's this?

16:44.083 --> 16:47.000
Murray:
Oh, here we go.
The Fonzies have arrived.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.708
This is Demetri.
This is my new band.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.708
Good luck.
Murray: Oh, great.

16:50.708 --> 16:52.625
Another awkward
situation.

16:52.625 --> 16:55.125
So what's your band
going to be called, Bret?

16:55.125 --> 16:57.208
Can't be called
Flight of the Conchords,
that's our name.

16:57.208 --> 16:59.917
It's not.
It's called the Original
Flight of the Conchords.

16:59.917 --> 17:02.083
You guys can be called
Flight of the Condors,
or whatever.

17:02.083 --> 17:03.917
We're gonna be
the Crazy Dogggz.

17:03.917 --> 17:05.250
Shut up, Todd.

17:05.250 --> 17:07.125
Don't tell me to shut up
in front of people.

17:07.125 --> 17:11.083
Well, don't say
what out name's gonna be.
We haven't discussed it.

17:11.083 --> 17:13.500
Okay, Jemaine, Bret.
Can I have a quiet word?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.250
Sure.
Come on, Demetri.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.250
No no, private.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.291
I'm just gonna play
some more.

17:23.291 --> 17:26.125
Stop talking.
What do you play,
the leather jacket?

17:26.125 --> 17:28.458
I play
the bongos, man.

17:28.458 --> 17:30.208
What the hell's
going on, guys?

17:30.208 --> 17:31.917
Why did you fire Bret,
Jemaine?

17:31.917 --> 17:34.792
Well, I was trying to fire Todd
but he did a sad face at me.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.625
I don't know if you
can fire Bret.

17:36.625 --> 17:39.333
You're equal band members.
It's got to come from
a higher authority.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.125
Are you sure?
Ye-- no.

17:41.125 --> 17:42.583
I'll have to check,
but it doesn't sound right.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.583
Yeah, I told him
he couldn't fire me.

17:44.583 --> 17:46.500
What do you care
for anyway, Bret?
You're always quitting.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.667
Probably just quit
in half an hour anyway.

17:48.667 --> 17:51.792
So I've got two bands now.
Just manage us both.

17:51.792 --> 17:54.250
No, I can't.
I'm not even suppose
to manage one band.

17:54.250 --> 17:56.625
I'm supposed to be working at
the New Zealand Consulate, Bret!

17:56.625 --> 17:59.083
Murray, do you think
you could find another cubicle?

17:59.083 --> 18:01.291
Oh, sorry, Greg.
Yeah, all right.

18:01.291 --> 18:02.792
Let's just calm down,
all right?

18:02.792 --> 18:04.417
We shouldn't even be arguing
in front of the map.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.959
It's not right.
Yeah, you're right.

18:06.959 --> 18:09.792
You'll be okay, Jemaine.
You've got a good band.
You've got Todd.

18:09.792 --> 18:11.583
I just don't know
about your guy, Bret.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.500
Does he play
any other instruments?
No.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.458
Demetri:
Come on, what?
Is that what you want?

18:15.458 --> 18:17.708
Todd:
I'm gonna break your keytar.
I'm gonna break your keytar.

18:17.708 --> 18:19.959
Demetri:

sounding good, though.
The bongos sound tight.

We're doing a lot better
than you and I were doing.

19:29.333 --> 19:32.250

are doing pretty well.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.792

there and come over.

20:30.792 --> 20:32.667
Okay, Bret.

20:32.667 --> 20:33.834
Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

Present.

20:40.458 --> 20:41.959
Nice.
Good one.

20:41.959 --> 20:43.875
And Murray, present.
Okay.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.959
Went really good tonight.
Really good, you two.

20:45.959 --> 20:47.667
Thank you.
And good, you two too.

20:47.667 --> 20:50.667
But I think in the future
I won't put you all on
the same night

20:50.667 --> 20:53.500
because you're playing
the same songs, okay?

20:53.500 --> 20:57.166
Actually, Jemaine, what about
that song of Todd's?

20:57.166 --> 20:59.542
You could do
the one about the dogs.
"The Doggy Bounce."

20:59.542 --> 21:01.625
Bring that one in.
I like that one.
Arf arf.

21:01.625 --> 21:03.959
Yeah, it's not
ready though.
You know it's ready.

21:03.959 --> 21:06.458
When it's ready,
we'll do it.
It's ready!

21:06.458 --> 21:08.375
Oh, hey hey hey, guys!
( arguing )

21:08.375 --> 21:11.542
Chill out!
It's been ready!
It's been ready!

21:11.542 --> 21:13.667
Come on, listen.
Look, shake hands.

21:13.667 --> 21:15.792
We're not having this.
All right?

21:15.792 --> 21:18.000
Ow! He's squeezing
my hand a little bit.
Are you?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.625
Just my regular handshake.

21:19.625 --> 21:22.166
There's no squeeze there.
What a wuss.

21:22.166 --> 21:24.625
Right, I'm glad
you're all here

21:24.625 --> 21:27.083
because I've got a crazy idea.
It could be big.

21:27.083 --> 21:29.500
But what about if we put
the two bands together

21:29.500 --> 21:30.667
to make one superband?

21:30.667 --> 21:33.417
A four-man
supergroup?
Yeah.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.875
So we've got
bongos, bass,

21:35.875 --> 21:37.792
guitar and...

21:37.792 --> 21:40.208
the keytar thing.

21:40.208 --> 21:43.208
Todd, what do you think?
Well, actually, Murray,

21:43.208 --> 21:45.792
um, Demetri and I have been
talking and we--

21:45.792 --> 21:50.041
we think it would be better
if we just go it alone.

21:50.041 --> 21:51.250
What?
What?

21:51.250 --> 21:52.667
I'm sorry.
What are you talking about?

21:52.667 --> 21:54.125
Todd and I are going
to start a group--

21:54.125 --> 21:56.208
our own group
without Bret and Jerome.

21:56.208 --> 21:58.125
We're the Crazy Dogggz.

21:58.125 --> 22:00.041
Arf.
Arf. See that?

22:00.041 --> 22:04.417
Are you crazy?
What, the bongos
and the keytar?

22:04.417 --> 22:05.792
Todd!

22:05.792 --> 22:09.542
Murray, I-- I really
appreciate you
giving me a shot

22:09.542 --> 22:11.208
and I just--

22:11.208 --> 22:13.291
I just think
we're more compatible.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.583
I'm flabbergasted.

Hey, Mel.

Oh hey, guys.

23:49.333 --> 23:52.542
How's it going?
Good. You know,
just really busy.

23:52.542 --> 23:55.000
Just crazy life...

23:55.000 --> 23:58.083

23:58.083 --> 24:00.208
Hey, you got one
of the Crazy Dogggz T-shirts.

24:00.208 --> 24:02.166
No.

24:03.667 --> 24:05.500
It says
Crazy Dogggz on it.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.417
I've got to go, actually.
I'm pretty late.

24:07.417 --> 24:10.250
Oh.
Yeah.
It was great seeing you.

24:10.250 --> 24:13.750
Oh...
uh... okay.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.000
Hey, Mel, you didn't make it
to our gig the other--

24:15.000 --> 24:16.166
Oh, yeah.

24:16.166 --> 24:18.333
There was
no one there...

Well, sorry I haven't
been in touch.

24:35.708 --> 24:38.125
I've just been so busy,
man, you know?

24:38.125 --> 24:40.291
How are the Crazy Dogggz?
They're a phenomenon.

24:40.291 --> 24:41.667
Number one
in 24 countries.

24:41.667 --> 24:43.834
They say hi?
No.

24:43.834 --> 24:46.041
Have you seen
the music video?

24:46.041 --> 24:47.333
Yeah.
Yeah, terrible.

24:47.333 --> 24:49.208
I helped direct it.
It was good.

24:49.208 --> 24:51.333
Know the dog?
It was my idea.
Really?

24:51.333 --> 24:53.458
It's Toby.
How was South America?

24:53.458 --> 24:56.667
Oh, awesome.
Really good, thanks.
Yeah.

24:56.667 --> 24:58.917
We did one gig--
98,000 people.

24:58.917 --> 25:00.542
That was in Rio.

25:00.542 --> 25:03.792
Then the president of Peru
invited us to like a dinner.

25:03.792 --> 25:05.792
We had parfaits.

25:05.792 --> 25:09.083
I got like a big sun lounger.

25:09.083 --> 25:10.834
Do we have any gigs,
Murray?

25:10.834 --> 25:12.750
Yeah.
Yeah, you've got the library.

25:12.750 --> 25:14.542
They want you back
for the bingo night.

25:14.542 --> 25:16.667
That was good the first
time, wasn't it?
Yeah.

25:16.667 --> 25:20.125
Actually that's the same
night that the Crazy Dogggz
have got a big gig.

25:20.125 --> 25:22.792
Giant Stadium.
How giant is it?

25:22.792 --> 25:25.834
That's what it's called-- Giant.
So I'm guessing pretty big.

25:25.834 --> 25:27.458
So I'm gonna go there first,
set them up,

25:27.458 --> 25:29.417
and then come back to
the library, help you guys out,

25:29.417 --> 25:32.041
and then probably to
and fro between the library
and the stadium.

25:32.041 --> 25:35.708
Yeah, Murray, it seems like
you're spending a lot more time
with the Crazy Dogggz than us.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.041
No, equal time.

25:37.041 --> 25:38.750
Check my schedules,
it's equal.

25:38.750 --> 25:40.083
Really?
Yeah.

25:40.083 --> 25:41.917
I can't discuss it now
'cause I've got to go.

25:41.917 --> 25:43.458
I've got lunch
with Tori Amos.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.583
( car alarm beeps )
