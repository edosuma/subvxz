WEBVTT

00:08.926 --> 00:11.010
It's basically Party Central.

00:11.052 --> 00:12.888
The booze, the drugs.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.850
Honestly, Mom, it's a lot of work having so much fun.

00:15.891 --> 00:18.018
<i> Thanks for taking one</i> <i>for the team, honey.</i>

00:18.059 --> 00:19.687
<i></i> -Oh, fine.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.856
Biggest problem here is the noise.

00:21.897 --> 00:25.359
Life with Liv and Peyton is pretty much like living

00:21.897 --> 00:25.359
in a brothel.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.111
You're probably having a hard time even hearing me

00:25.400 --> 00:28.111
with all the

00:28.153 --> 00:30.906
wild sex that's going on.

00:30.948 --> 00:34.660
I mean, yeah, now that Curtis is a zombie,

00:30.948 --> 00:34.660
Chase Graves can't eat

00:34.702 --> 00:36.745
his brain and uncover all the railroad's secrets,

00:36.787 --> 00:39.373
but he can do other things to get him to talk.

00:39.414 --> 00:42.710
And that's all Curtis's pregnant girlfriend

00:39.414 --> 00:42.710
can think about.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.753
It's all I'm thinking about.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.755
Your parents are gonna love me,

00:46.797 --> 00:49.174
all parents do.

00:49.216 --> 00:52.302
I'm like a tall stuffed animal with a medical

00:49.216 --> 00:52.302
degree, you'll see.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.513
I hope so.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.348
It would be great if you could check in on them while

00:54.555 --> 00:56.348
I'm in DC.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.308
Wait, you're...

00:58.350 --> 00:59.935
You're going to DC?

00:59.977 --> 01:01.770
Yeah, in a couple days.

01:03.856 --> 01:06.274
Did I forget to mention it?

01:06.316 --> 01:08.109
Yeah, you did.

01:10.612 --> 01:13.073
By the way, your voice goes up an entire octave when

01:10.612 --> 01:13.073
you're being sneaky.

01:13.114 --> 01:14.783
I'm not being sneaky.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.117
That's two octaves.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.870
You know how I used to be afraid of needles?

01:18.871 --> 01:19.997
What?

01:20.039 --> 01:21.957
You're making that face again.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.000
<i>Your nose.</i>

01:26.169 --> 01:27.713
Oh, um...

01:27.755 --> 01:30.799
This? This is nothing.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.968
It's just a regular bloody nose,

01:33.010 --> 01:35.012
not the certain death kind.

01:35.054 --> 01:36.805
<i>How long have you been</i> <i>getting these?</i>

01:37.973 --> 01:39.808
Um, first time.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.227
It's nothing, really. Gotta run.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.227
Talk later, love you.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.270
<i>Honey?</i>

01:47.649 --> 01:49.860
Isobel, are you hungry?

01:49.902 --> 01:54.031
'Cause I'm in a waffle kind of mood.

01:54.073 --> 01:56.366
What's wrong?

01:59.954 --> 02:01.914
Oh, my God, is she... Dead

02:05.709 --> 02:07.711
No, gotcha.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.799
You should see your faces right now.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.218
So angry.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.012
So drained of blood.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.597
Why would you do that?

02:18.639 --> 02:19.974
Are you out of your mind?

02:21.433 --> 02:23.852
This bloody nose, is it real?

02:27.522 --> 02:29.984
Look, I know you're pissed,

02:30.025 --> 02:32.235
but if you just saw my bloody nose,

02:32.277 --> 02:34.404
you'd freak because of the whole

02:32.277 --> 02:34.404
"I'll be dead soon" thing.

02:34.446 --> 02:37.074
But since you thought I was already dead,

02:37.116 --> 02:38.867
and it turns out I'm not,

02:38.909 --> 02:40.619
you're relieved.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.287
Right?

02:42.329 --> 02:43.872
It's all about context.

02:46.541 --> 02:47.501
Right?

02:57.886 --> 02:59.721
We have to check Isobel into a hospital.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.682
Her opinion on the matter is irrelevant.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.725
She's right about one thing.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.478
All they're gonna do there is put her in a bed until

03:03.767 --> 03:06.478
she dies.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.022
And how are we gonna get her there?

03:08.063 --> 03:09.481
Conk her on the head?

03:10.440 --> 03:11.900
Mornin'!

03:11.942 --> 03:14.069
Time to solve some murders.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.822
We're burnin' daylight.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.866
Sounds like someone didn't get his flu shot.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.743
And maybe turn into a werewolf? No, thanks.

03:23.162 --> 03:25.539
The murder happened last night around 11:00

03:25.580 --> 03:27.541
in the parking lot of Sick Puppies.

03:27.582 --> 03:28.625
Sick Puppies?

03:28.667 --> 03:29.918
It's a bar off 5th.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.586
It shares a building with a pet hospital.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.507
Looks like blunt force trauma to the head.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.217
Oh, thank you, Doctor.

03:37.258 --> 03:39.219
Do you mind if I render an opinion so all those years

03:39.260 --> 03:40.929
at medical school don't feel wasted?

03:40.971 --> 03:43.891
Man, she's got pretty big hair.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.768
And a pretty big penis.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.771
I guess all that medical schooling did pay off.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.356
Meet Vince.

03:51.398 --> 03:54.151
He was at an office retirement party for his boss,

03:54.193 --> 03:56.277
where some of the workers did a little "skit".

03:56.319 --> 04:01.241
He played the part of Sheila, the very real head of HR.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.368
Apparently, he got a lot of laughs.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.121
And enough blunt force trauma to tear his carotid

04:03.410 --> 04:06.121
artery in half.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.956
What did Sheila think of his performance?

04:07.998 --> 04:10.375
His co-workers said that she was not amused.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.335
Sounds like we have our first suspect.

04:21.136 --> 04:25.807
More than 40% of our brains aren't making it to our

04:21.136 --> 04:25.807
distribution centers.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.559
The theft happens after the trucks

04:27.601 --> 04:29.937
with the brain tubes leave the packaging plant,

04:29.978 --> 04:32.898
but before they get to the distribution centers.

04:32.940 --> 04:36.068
We may, however, have a solution.

04:37.027 --> 04:37.945
What are those?

04:37.986 --> 04:39.988
High-tech crates.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.991
Manufactured by a Japanese security firm.

04:43.033 --> 04:46.120
If breached, they signal their location.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.955
They look expensive.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.957
They are. Major.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.208
Test them out in the field.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.333
If they work, we'll make the switch.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.919
Yes, sir.

04:53.961 --> 04:59.841
I said I want camera two on sticks, not handheld!

04:59.883 --> 05:02.385
And when he walks to stage left,

05:02.427 --> 05:05.388
I want him backlit like Ripley in<i> Aliens,</i>

05:05.430 --> 05:08.892
when she says "Get away from her, you bitch!"

05:10.144 --> 05:12.312
Just 'cause you ate the brain

05:12.353 --> 05:14.982
of some jackass who directs music videos does not make

05:12.353 --> 05:14.982
you a director.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.817
Actually, that's exactly what it means.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.026
That's how it works.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.737
What's all this?

05:20.779 --> 05:25.075
This is for you, Mr. Number One on the call sheet.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.952
We are taking you global.

05:26.994 --> 05:30.622
These walls are not big enough to hold you.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.750
You sermonize, I will film-atize.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.586
And then we will put it out there and you will become

05:36.628 --> 05:39.798
the spiritual leader of the New World Order.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.050
I'm already the spiritual leader of the New World Order.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.094
We're just letting everybody else know that.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.641
Lieutenant, I know you're busy,

05:49.683 --> 05:51.143
but just one more time, please.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.812
Okay, but, seriously, last time.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.231
Oh, thanks. It is just so

05:53.854 --> 05:56.231
damn funny.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.987
<i> You and Michelle</i> <i>knockin' boots yet?</i>

06:02.029 --> 06:03.404
No, not this.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.699
The part where Liv beats the dude with the fish.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.826
<i> I'm not doing</i> <i>this dance with you, Liv.</i>

06:07.868 --> 06:09.494
<i> Hand stuff?</i>

06:09.536 --> 06:12.206
<i> Look, we kissed,</i> <i>the night of the lockdown.</i>

06:12.247 --> 06:13.123
<i> I knew it.</i>

06:13.165 --> 06:14.791
<i> It's complicated.</i>

06:14.833 --> 06:17.211
<i>Look, I love Dale, but...</i>

06:17.252 --> 06:20.214
I just realized, I'm late for a thing.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.174
Show me later.

06:25.260 --> 06:28.055
<i> I've also been thinking</i> <i>about how every future</i>

06:28.096 --> 06:30.891
<i>I've imagined for myself</i> <i>had kids in it.</i>

06:33.476 --> 06:35.062
<i>I wanna be a dad, Liv.</i>

06:35.103 --> 06:37.814
<i>With a human like Michelle,</i> <i>that can happen.</i>

06:37.856 --> 06:40.192
<i>They're not letting zombies</i> <i>adopt, so, you know,</i>

06:40.234 --> 06:46.656
<i>with Dale, that'd</i> <i>mean no kids... Ever.</i>

06:52.287 --> 06:54.331
Look, I love to laugh.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.291
I just didn't think Vince was funny.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.584
I'm an easy target.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.794
I run HR, everybody hates HR,

06:59.836 --> 07:01.880
but I don't hold grudges.

07:01.922 --> 07:05.508
Although, I will say Vince is certainly a cheeky

07:01.922 --> 07:05.508
one to make fun of people,

07:05.550 --> 07:07.052
with all his problems.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.305
-He's a crazy germophobe.

07:10.347 --> 07:13.892
The guy won't touch a doorknob,

07:13.934 --> 07:16.686
and then there's the constant hand scrubbing.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.148
And with this flu going around?

07:20.190 --> 07:22.483
Please, if Vince was here, he'd be crawling out

07:20.190 --> 07:22.483
of his skin.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.652
Sorry I'm late.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.738
With all the hacking and sneezing,

07:26.780 --> 07:29.449
trying to get through town is like ice-skating on

07:26.780 --> 07:29.449
a Petri dish.

07:31.326 --> 07:33.536
What did I miss?

07:33.578 --> 07:35.747
Sheila here was expressing her displeasure

07:33.578 --> 07:35.747
with Vince's portrayal of her.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.125
But not enough to kill him, my God!

07:38.166 --> 07:42.170
Listen, you look like me, you get pretty used to guys

07:38.166 --> 07:42.170
staring at your boobs.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.300
-Come on.

07:46.341 --> 07:49.094
If you're not gonna let me buy you a shot, then let me

07:46.341 --> 07:49.094
buy you a beer.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.221
Come on, be a little friendlier.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.224
Dude, that's a dude.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.184
Bet you think

07:56.226 --> 07:59.104
you're real funny, don't you, huh? You piece of--

08:00.688 --> 08:01.689
What?

08:01.731 --> 08:03.108
We need to talk to number 25

08:03.150 --> 08:04.692
on the Sick Puppies softball team.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.445
I'll track down a roster.

08:09.114 --> 08:11.532
There's a lot of love out there.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.329
And you're the man with the plan.

08:15.370 --> 08:18.748
You're gonna kill tonight, baby, but don't actually

08:15.370 --> 08:18.748
kill anybody,

08:18.790 --> 08:21.084
because people are gonna see this.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.919
That was a joke, of course.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.338
But seriously, don't.

08:24.379 --> 08:25.880
Don't kill anyone.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.466
-Let's begin. -I love that enthusiasm.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.134
Just one small thought.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.178
Instead of starting at a ten,

08:31.219 --> 08:35.140
maybe you can start at a three or four,

08:35.182 --> 08:38.518
and then build to a ten.

08:41.146 --> 08:42.730
Just one man's opinion.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.358
Yes, Mr. E?

08:44.399 --> 08:46.193
Hit it.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.362
-New theme music. My idea.

08:51.323 --> 08:52.615
You're welcome.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.381
Answer me this, brothers and sisters.

09:07.422 --> 09:10.425
Does the rabbit tell the wolf when it can be eaten?

09:10.467 --> 09:12.219
No!

09:12.260 --> 09:14.388
Or you can start on a ten.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.805
Medical examiner, huh?

09:15.847 --> 09:17.932
That must be a tough gig right now.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.310
Everyone's dead, but nobody's dying.

09:20.352 --> 09:23.604
If those damn zombies have their way, you're gonna be

09:20.352 --> 09:23.604
out of work really soon.

09:25.606 --> 09:27.317
The spaghetti is

09:27.359 --> 09:28.651
so good, isn't it, Bill?

09:28.693 --> 09:31.238
Yes, dear, it is.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.156
And you don't have to redirect my conversation like

09:31.279 --> 09:33.156
I'm some kind of toddler,

09:33.198 --> 09:34.324
Emily.

09:34.366 --> 09:37.202
Look, I like you.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.580
You're a hell of a lot more engaging and personable

09:37.244 --> 09:40.580
than Peyton's usual boyfriends.

09:40.621 --> 09:43.375
Okay. Dad, we're not doing this, okay?

09:43.417 --> 09:45.835
My God, Peyton, I'm giving the man a compliment.

09:45.877 --> 09:48.338
I'd much rather you settle for an ME with personality

09:48.380 --> 09:50.173
than an actual doctor with none.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.594
-Judge Charles...

09:54.635 --> 09:57.389
I am an actual doctor, and you're not giving me

09:54.635 --> 09:57.389
a compliment.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.766
You're taking a dig at me to get a rise out

09:57.431 --> 09:59.766
of your daughter,

09:59.807 --> 10:01.935
and I want it to stop. Now.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.237
These meatballs sure are tasty.

10:12.279 --> 10:15.031
<i>And you can bet when</i> <i>the time arrives,</i>

10:15.073 --> 10:16.491
<i>they'll come with</i> <i>their pitchforks,</i>

10:16.533 --> 10:19.327
<i>they'll come</i> <i>with their torches--</i>

10:19.369 --> 10:22.289
Are you crying because of the medical condition,

10:19.369 --> 10:22.289
or because

10:22.330 --> 10:23.873
it moved you to tears?

10:23.915 --> 10:27.252
The condition, but I did think that Angus was powerful.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.421
And the cut

10:29.463 --> 10:31.672
The zoom in the last shot felt unmotivated.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.635
Unmotivated zoom--

10:36.470 --> 10:38.638
Screw you.

10:38.679 --> 10:44.519
I'm not gonna sit here and take film criticism from

10:38.679 --> 10:44.519
some weeping monster.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.354
You asked my opinion.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.982
I'm sorry, I'm just fragile. This is my baby.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.734
It's upload time.

10:51.776 --> 10:55.738
Right after we add some hashtags.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.450
Hashtag zombie, hashtag apocalypse.

10:58.492 --> 10:59.826
Sure.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.869
I mean, we want people to see it.

11:02.537 --> 11:03.497
So...

11:03.538 --> 11:07.542
Hashtag lesbians, hashtag twins,

11:07.584 --> 11:13.131
hashtag badonkadonk, hashtag bodacious tatas.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.674
It's disrespectful, Don E.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.969
Women with large breasts are born that way.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.554
Yeah, some of them.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.350
Fine.

11:23.391 --> 11:28.480
Forgot your progressive views on such things, but

11:23.391 --> 11:28.480
badonkadonk is fine.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.775
We're live.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.363
Well, I'll be back in a few days.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.532
While I'm gone, Ravi said he'll pop over and see

11:36.404 --> 11:38.532
how you're doing.

11:38.573 --> 11:41.117
Feed us our formula, change our diapers,

11:38.573 --> 11:41.117
that kind of thing?

11:41.159 --> 11:44.162
Exactly, although I draw the line at burping.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.330
You may just have to remain gassy.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.084
And, hey, with Mom, you know, volunteering, and your back...

11:50.126 --> 11:51.878
Remember what happened last time your back went out?

11:51.919 --> 11:53.547
I do, I do.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.340
-And you refuse to wear a-- -Of course, I didn't.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.715
Don't even say it. You think I'll wear a medical...

11:56.757 --> 11:58.510
-I'm not an old man. -Okay.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.430
It's very nice of you to offer, Ravi.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.474
Yes, thank you.

12:04.516 --> 12:07.018
You know, Peyton, um... I'm glad you brought up

12:04.516 --> 12:07.018
your trip to DC,

12:07.060 --> 12:08.687
because actually, um...

12:08.727 --> 12:10.438
Your mother and I...

12:10.480 --> 12:11.898
We want to talk to you about it.

12:11.939 --> 12:14.733
Guys, it's my job, I have to go.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.444
I'll be perfectly safe.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.029
We're not asking you to cancel the trip.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.947
Oh.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.824
-Good. -We came here to tell you

12:19.989 --> 12:21.824
that when you get to DC...

12:21.866 --> 12:24.118
Stay.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.746
Just don't ever come back to Seattle.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.207
Why in the world would I do that?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.042
Because there is a faction out there

12:31.084 --> 12:34.421
that wants to stop all the brain shipments

12:31.084 --> 12:34.421
to this city.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.340
They want the humans and monsters to

12:34.462 --> 12:37.340
fight it out,

12:37.382 --> 12:39.800
and they say if the humans win, great.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.596
But if the zombies win, they're gonna nuke

12:39.842 --> 12:42.596
the city.

12:42.637 --> 12:46.474
So either way, you are better off anywhere

12:42.637 --> 12:46.474
outside those walls.

12:46.516 --> 12:49.561
I know that, Dad. I'm going to DC

12:46.516 --> 12:49.561
to try and prevent that

12:49.603 --> 12:50.811
from happening.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.439
This is going to end badly.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.399
-Stay away. -I appreciate

12:52.480 --> 12:54.399
your concern...

12:54.441 --> 12:56.651
But this is out of the question!

12:56.693 --> 12:57.860
With the Mayor dead--

12:57.902 --> 13:00.572
Killed by a zombie, no doubt.

13:00.614 --> 13:03.617
Until a new mayor is elected, I am, for all intents

13:00.614 --> 13:03.617
and purposes, running the city.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.826
Ravi, talk some sense into them.

13:08.580 --> 13:12.375
Honestly, I agree with them.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.085
Once you leave, I don't think you should come back.

13:15.545 --> 13:16.546
It's not safe here.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.633
That's my boy.

13:19.674 --> 13:22.469
-I told you this man was a keeper.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.387
Listen to him, Peyton, please.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.648
So, I'll grab some food before you go home?

13:34.689 --> 13:38.025
I was thinking Al-Shabaz kebabs.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.487
Come in, please close the door.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.534
"Close the door."

13:47.494 --> 13:48.911
Sounds serious.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.289
You must really hate kebabs.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.127
We need to end this thing, Clive.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.128
Break up?

13:59.922 --> 14:01.341
We gave it our best.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.926
We really did.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.345
Dale...

14:05.386 --> 14:06.471
I met someone else.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.268
That was against the rules.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.313
Yeah, um...

14:15.355 --> 14:17.524
Well...

14:17.565 --> 14:21.486
Do you have something that

14:17.565 --> 14:21.486
you could do?

14:21.528 --> 14:24.113
For a couple of hours, so I could go over to your place

14:21.528 --> 14:24.113
and clear out my stuff?

15:01.150 --> 15:02.569
I'm a boob man,

15:02.610 --> 15:05.238
what can I say?

15:05.279 --> 15:07.615
I'd had a few too many, I thought I was talking

15:05.279 --> 15:07.615
to a hot chick with a big rack.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.201
You're a guy, you know how it goes.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.079
Clive?

15:15.373 --> 15:17.375
Oh, I'm sorry, I was just, um...

15:17.417 --> 15:19.460
What were you saying?

15:19.502 --> 15:21.087
Someone broke up with you?

15:21.128 --> 15:22.839
Uh, no.

15:22.881 --> 15:25.550
We were talking about how Ron

15:22.881 --> 15:25.550
was hitting on Vince,

15:25.592 --> 15:27.886
until your buddies started razzing you about it.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.846
Were you feeling humiliated?

15:31.931 --> 15:33.933
Which is why you called the victim a piece of--

15:33.974 --> 15:35.894
Ah, ah...

15:35.935 --> 15:37.395
No. No.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.152
God.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.914
I think her point is you had motive to kill Vince.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.290
I wasn't that motivated.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.751
Besides, I saw the guy that punched Vince.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.920
That's probably your killer.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.922
Vince was killed by a blow to the head.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.005
Oh.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.176
Well, in that case, I saw the murder.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.887
Yeah, I was headed out to my car,

16:10.929 --> 16:12.305
and I see the son of a bitch that I just hit on,

16:12.346 --> 16:15.809
and then I see his or her exact double.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.604
He must've seen Vince and Sheila.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.607
Are you mansplaining the case to me, Detective?

16:22.649 --> 16:23.942
I'm up to speed.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.112
-Ugh.

16:28.154 --> 16:28.988
Go on.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.490
At first, I thought

16:30.531 --> 16:32.032
I was seeing double 'cause, you know, beers.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.743
One of them was your dead guy

16:33.785 --> 16:35.202
trying to get into his car.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.747
And the other was, I guess, a real lady.

16:37.789 --> 16:41.292
Real Lady was getting picked up by a big dude

16:37.789 --> 16:41.292
in a Cutlass.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.337
He sees your victim and he yells out,

16:41.334 --> 16:44.337
"It's not funny,

16:44.378 --> 16:45.755
you bleeping bleep.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.340
It's demeaning."

16:47.381 --> 16:49.843
Dead Guy gets in his car real quick.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.928
He did not wanna mess with Big Guy.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.513
Big Dude and Big Guy?

16:53.554 --> 16:55.139
Same person.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.933
Then, when Dead Guy is safely in his car,

16:56.975 --> 16:59.853
he flipped off Big Dude in the Cutlass.

16:59.894 --> 17:03.063
Big Dude gets out of his car, marches over

16:59.894 --> 17:03.063
to Dead Guy

17:03.105 --> 17:04.732
while he's trying to get the engine turned over

17:04.774 --> 17:07.485
and punches him through the window.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.030
Through the window.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.406
Probably a zombie raging out.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.741
Did you see his eyes?

17:13.783 --> 17:16.285
No, I was behind him.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.329
Well, it says here that Sheila is married.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.456
We should see how big that husband is.

17:20.498 --> 17:24.210
Are you ready to visit our next culinary

17:20.498 --> 17:24.210
destination?

17:24.251 --> 17:28.047
Yesterday, pizza took us to the mob-ruled

17:24.251 --> 17:28.047
shores of Sicily.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.633
Today, we visit the mysterious Orient.

17:32.259 --> 17:33.093
Isobel.

17:36.848 --> 17:40.267
You are so easy.

17:40.309 --> 17:44.188
Yeah.  Hilarious.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.984
Look, I know this is just your coping mechanism,

17:48.026 --> 17:51.571
but would you mind picking one not quite so heart attack-y

17:48.026 --> 17:51.571
for me?

17:51.612 --> 17:53.447
I'm almost out of time.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.824
No.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.285
He's out of time.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.079
You're still movin' and groovin'.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.798
Look,

18:10.840 --> 18:13.718
think of me as your, uh, personal genie

18:13.760 --> 18:17.847
with no magical abilities, of course.

18:17.889 --> 18:20.140
Tell me your heart's fondest desire.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.020
Teach me how to drive?

18:24.062 --> 18:25.312
Oh.

18:25.354 --> 18:28.733
The genie was not expecting that.

18:28.775 --> 18:33.237
But, in spite of the fact that putting a teenager with very

18:28.775 --> 18:33.237
little to lose

18:33.279 --> 18:35.531
in charge of a 4,000-pound vehicle

18:35.573 --> 18:38.367
with me inside is objectively terrifying...

18:41.412 --> 18:42.538
Your wish is my command.

18:46.918 --> 18:47.961
Oh.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.924
Oh, and unlimited wishes.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.300
Damn.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.969
Should've thought of that first.

18:57.762 --> 18:59.722
So has our friend Russ Roche taken the bait?

18:59.764 --> 19:01.307
He has.

19:01.348 --> 19:02.976
He says it's time for me to meet his boss.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.186
Be careful.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.776
Commander. You need to see this.

19:13.778 --> 19:16.322
<i>The only creature more</i> <i>despicable than a human</i>

19:16.363 --> 19:19.450
<i>is a zombie who</i> <i>murders other zombies!</i>

19:19.492 --> 19:24.246
<i>These infidels go by</i> <i>the name of Fillmore Graves,</i>

19:24.288 --> 19:27.583
<i>because they want to fill</i> <i>more graves with you,</i>

19:27.625 --> 19:29.251
<i>brothers and sisters.</i>

19:30.377 --> 19:32.672
<i>They have the guns,</i>

19:32.713 --> 19:35.174
<i>but we've got</i> <i>God on our side.</i>

19:36.425 --> 19:37.802
This went up last night.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.303
It's blowing up.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.639
Oh, boy.

19:41.681 --> 19:47.478
<i> We'll treat humans</i> <i>like chattel and slaughter them</i>

19:41.681 --> 19:47.478
<i>like cattle.</i>

19:47.520 --> 19:53.151
<i>We'll breed them</i> <i>like cattle and bread</i>

19:47.520 --> 19:53.151
<i>them like cutlets.</i>

19:53.192 --> 19:55.069
<i>If there's a zombie out there</i>

19:55.111 --> 19:57.571
<i>who's feeling sorry</i> <i>for himself,</i>

19:57.613 --> 20:00.825
<i>you don't deserve the honor</i> <i>of joining the ranks</i>

19:57.613 --> 20:00.825
<i>of the undead!</i>

20:00.867 --> 20:04.453
<i>We are stronger.</i> <i>We are faster.</i>

20:04.495 --> 20:06.246
<i>And we are blessed by God.</i>

20:06.288 --> 20:09.249
<i>It's time to take what's ours.</i>

20:09.291 --> 20:11.961
<i>Humans may look</i> <i>like us, but they are not us</i>

20:12.003 --> 20:13.546
<i>because they were</i> <i>born to die.</i>

20:13.587 --> 20:15.548
Hey, just wanted to say goodbye.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.425
I'm headed off on my little goodwill trip

20:15.589 --> 20:18.425
to Washington.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.511
<i> They paint</i> <i>"Z's" on our doors.</i>

20:22.555 --> 20:25.391
<i>They do it because they're</i> <i>waiting, too.</i>

20:25.432 --> 20:29.187
And you can bet, when the time arrives, they'll come

20:25.432 --> 20:29.187
with their pitchforks.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.397
<i>They'll come</i> <i>with their torches</i>

20:29.228 --> 20:31.397
<i>and their shotguns.</i>

20:31.438 --> 20:34.400
<i>And God speaks to me,</i> <i>and he says, "Why</i>

20:31.438 --> 20:34.400
<i>wait for that day?</i>

20:34.441 --> 20:36.443
<i>Take the fight</i> <i>to them!"</i>

20:36.485 --> 20:38.571
-<i> Take it to them!</i>

20:38.612 --> 20:40.364
<i>Take it to them!</i>

20:40.406 --> 20:43.409
Enjoy your goodwill trip, honey.

20:43.450 --> 20:47.329
This certainly puts a kink in my "we can all live

20:43.450 --> 20:47.329
in harmony" speech.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.426
Knock 'em dead.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.182
Uh, just...

21:06.224 --> 21:07.641
Germophobe brain, so...

21:10.603 --> 21:11.729
Okay.

21:22.489 --> 21:24.575
Really, you two?

21:25.743 --> 21:28.621
I'm coming back, I swear.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.081
You'll hardly know I'm gone.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.596
Isobel?

21:45.638 --> 21:48.599
Peyton left you a gift for your first driving lesson.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.936
It's a lucky rabbit's foot key chain

21:51.978 --> 21:53.520
from a very unlucky rabbit.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.575
Fine.

22:06.617 --> 22:08.286
I'll just throw out the key chain.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.664
Have I gone to the well too many times?

22:11.705 --> 22:15.126
You're just lucky I have a soft spot for dark,

22:11.705 --> 22:15.126
repetitive humor.

22:23.217 --> 22:25.427
Have you been to the processing plant

22:25.469 --> 22:27.638
where they turn the brains into mush?

22:27.680 --> 22:30.599
-I have. -I don't want that for me.

22:30.641 --> 22:33.019
I want you to have it

22:33.060 --> 22:35.688
so that my memories can live on,

22:35.729 --> 22:38.983
even for just a little bit.

22:39.025 --> 22:42.611
There's nothing too exciting in there, but I'll...

22:42.653 --> 22:45.156
I'll have more peace of mind if you...

22:49.660 --> 22:51.829
Congratulations.

22:51.871 --> 22:55.666
You set a precinct record for most tasers required

22:51.871 --> 22:55.666
to subdue a suspect.

22:55.708 --> 23:00.754
And still managed to put two of your officers in the hospital.

23:00.796 --> 23:03.257
It's almost not your fault.

23:03.299 --> 23:08.512
To a zombie like you, humans are but weak little rag dolls,

23:03.299 --> 23:08.512
<i>n'est</i>

23:08.554 --> 23:10.681
Yeah, let's wrap this up.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.017
You've been arrested for assault seven times.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.727
You're married to the woman the victim offended.

23:14.768 --> 23:17.146
And we have an eyewitness who saw you punch him,

23:17.188 --> 23:19.773
likely the fatal blow. So why don't

23:19.815 --> 23:22.318
you just be a man and admit you killed him?

23:22.360 --> 23:25.905
Take your time. I understand that this must be

23:22.360 --> 23:25.905
upsetting for you.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.449
Oh, hell.

23:29.491 --> 23:31.035
I'm not upset.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.703
These tears are a medical condition.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.705
A man insults another man's wife,

23:34.747 --> 23:37.708
and that man cold cocks him for it.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.668
In what world is that a crime?

23:39.710 --> 23:40.711
This world.

23:40.753 --> 23:41.712
You killed the guy. Good.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.842
Well, that was easy.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.886
-This case is closed.

23:50.512 --> 23:53.307
Why don't you take some acetaminophen

23:53.349 --> 23:56.643
while I escort our killer to the Fillmore Graves

23:56.685 --> 23:58.938
freezer section?

23:58.979 --> 24:02.524
I will put him between the ice cream and the

23:58.979 --> 24:02.524
leggo

24:02.566 --> 24:04.402
Uh-huh.

24:16.414 --> 24:18.832
Where is the thimblewit that screwed up

24:16.414 --> 24:18.832
my steak dinner?

24:18.874 --> 24:20.793
I'm Corporal Benito, ma'am. And you are?

24:20.834 --> 24:22.544
Who am I

24:22.586 --> 24:24.338
I'm the single busiest woman in Seattle,

24:24.380 --> 24:26.799
and I did not have time for this little detour tonight.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.842
I'm sorry, ma'am.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.636
I still don't know who you are.

24:30.677 --> 24:32.221
I'm Peyton Charles,

24:32.263 --> 24:34.807
chief of staff to the late, great Mayor Floyd Baracus.

24:34.848 --> 24:36.600
Now I'm the de facto acting mayor,

24:36.642 --> 24:38.436
and I had better things to do tonight

24:38.476 --> 24:40.604
than visit a checkpoint outside the wall.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.231
Of course. Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

24:44.900 --> 24:45.943
You're wearing the same outfit.

24:47.485 --> 24:48.779
Good catch, Sherlock.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.906
You broke the case wide open.

24:50.948 --> 24:53.826
Guess what? I don't throw away blouses every time

24:50.948 --> 24:53.826
I wear one.

24:53.867 --> 24:57.955
Now, where's the genius down here who won't let my forensic

24:53.867 --> 24:57.955
accountant back into the city?

24:57.997 --> 24:59.497
Follow me this way.

25:03.710 --> 25:04.837
Ms. Escovido.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.380
Come on. The city needs you back.

25:06.422 --> 25:07.923
This is the last time we lend you out.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.633
-Yes, ma'am. -Is that...

25:09.675 --> 25:11.844
Yeah, that's the acting mayor, all right.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.137
It's the mayor.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.763
It's time to go get your daughter.

25:14.805 --> 25:16.182
Ms. Mayor, I've been here for three days.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.683
I have a brother inside the wall.

25:17.724 --> 25:19.477
Do you have any candy?

25:21.645 --> 25:23.022
-Ms. Mayor. -I really gotta go.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.398
Ms. Mayor.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.774
Visit the Rock and Roll Museum.

25:25.816 --> 25:27.360
You won't regret it.

25:27.401 --> 25:28.819
Mayor, please. -Don't forget to vote.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.571
Space Needle. Best view in the city.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.199
I really gotta go.

25:35.533 --> 25:36.994
Uncool, Russ.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.079
I thought I was a valued employee.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.914
This seems like overkill.

25:40.956 --> 25:41.957
We're here.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.754
That was fun.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.926
Sorry about the bag, it's just...

25:52.968 --> 25:54.636
until we get to know each other.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.263
-That's him.

25:56.305 --> 25:59.392
Name's Major, I'm ready to be rich.

25:59.433 --> 26:01.519
Russ says you're looking for a man who has

25:59.433 --> 26:01.519
Chase Grave's ear

26:01.559 --> 26:02.853
to make all your dreams come true.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.230
Whoa, there.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.440
You may be rich before you leave this room,

26:06.482 --> 26:08.234
but not until I know I can trust you.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.903
I'm also ready to be uncuffed and offered a drink.

26:12.863 --> 26:14.532
Patience, dude.

26:14.572 --> 26:16.450
First, you gotta pass a little test.

26:20.287 --> 26:23.665
This brain is from a Russian gang member,

26:23.707 --> 26:26.710
a rival, who we captured and questioned.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.546
Every time he told a lie, we gave him

26:26.752 --> 26:28.546
the old...

26:32.341 --> 26:38.013
We did this for weeks, until his brain was rewired.

26:38.055 --> 26:39.848
By the time he died, he was, like,

26:39.890 --> 26:42.560
literally incapable of lying.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.311
Just like you're about be.

26:47.064 --> 26:48.815
It's never failed us.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.570
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

26:57.533 --> 27:00.453
Am I gonna have to break your teeth with a hammer

26:57.533 --> 27:00.453
to get you to eat this,

27:00.494 --> 27:02.079
or will you be a big boy?

27:06.292 --> 27:08.043
I'll eat it.

27:08.085 --> 27:10.129
Just seems inhospitable, that's all.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.220
Now chew.

27:18.929 --> 27:21.014
And swallow.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.391
You know how to swallow, don't you?

27:22.433 --> 27:23.517
Just close your lips and--

27:23.559 --> 27:24.518
Now, what?

27:25.936 --> 27:26.979
Hmph.

27:27.854 --> 27:30.023
Now we wait.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.942
And then we find out whose side you're

27:30.065 --> 27:31.942
really on.

27:34.403 --> 27:35.988
Bring it on.

27:44.204 --> 27:46.415
Has it crossed my mind?

27:46.457 --> 27:48.834
Yeah. I mean, look how he's built.

27:48.875 --> 27:51.128
Where does he even find the time to work out?

27:51.170 --> 27:54.465
But, hey, it's not like I have pictures of Chase Graves

27:51.170 --> 27:54.465
taped up in my locker.

27:56.674 --> 27:58.636
Okay, I think it's safe to say the truth brain's

27:56.674 --> 27:58.636
kicked in.

27:58.676 --> 28:00.220
Then let's get right down to it,

28:02.055 --> 28:05.184
Are you with us or Fillmore Graves?

28:06.935 --> 28:08.437
Fillmore Graves.

28:09.313 --> 28:11.898
Duh.

28:11.940 --> 28:17.029
Oh, yeah. I've been pretending to be on your side the whole

28:11.940 --> 28:17.029
time, just playing Russ,

28:17.070 --> 28:19.948
gaining his trust, hoping he'd eventually

28:17.070 --> 28:19.948
bring me to you.

28:19.990 --> 28:23.827
Which he did, because he's not exactly

28:19.990 --> 28:23.827
Ivy League material.

28:23.869 --> 28:27.247
Like, maybe Brown, if he's got connections.

28:28.915 --> 28:31.043
It's actually kind of interesting how he did it.

28:31.084 --> 28:35.005
See, Chase and I figured if he announced that

28:31.084 --> 28:35.005
I was in charge of

28:35.047 --> 28:37.508
deciding whether or not to buy the fancy security

28:35.047 --> 28:37.508
measures,

28:37.550 --> 28:39.510
which never even existed, by the way,

28:39.552 --> 28:42.596
we just made them up, then Russ would

28:39.552 --> 28:42.596
bring me to you

28:42.638 --> 28:44.723
so you could convince me to veto it,

28:44.764 --> 28:48.977
which is exactly what Russ did, because Russ

28:44.764 --> 28:48.977
is a, um...

28:49.019 --> 28:50.896
Oh, what did Chase call him?

28:52.565 --> 28:53.899
"A dolt."

28:56.735 --> 29:01.865
So, yeah.  Short version,

28:56.735 --> 29:01.865
I'm here to take you down.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.493
-AJ, I had no idea. -Shut up!

29:06.036 --> 29:07.496
Well...

29:10.123 --> 29:13.502
Too bad things won't work out the way you planned, Major.

29:13.544 --> 29:16.838
Looks like you'll never get that gondola ride with

29:13.544 --> 29:16.838
Chase Graves

29:16.880 --> 29:18.424
in the Grand Canal.

29:21.134 --> 29:24.304
Actually, things worked out exactly as I'd planned because

29:21.134 --> 29:24.304
I swallowed a tracking device

29:24.346 --> 29:26.515
before coming here.

29:26.557 --> 29:27.891
And I've got cotton in my ears.

29:35.524 --> 29:37.943
Hey, guys. Great work.

29:37.984 --> 29:39.737
My squad's top-notch.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.572
Three of the four of them at least.

29:41.614 --> 29:42.948
Major, zip it.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.924
So how do you feel?

30:06.138 --> 30:09.433
I feel great. You were great, that was...

30:10.643 --> 30:11.977
Great.

30:12.018 --> 30:14.271
You sure everything's great?

30:18.233 --> 30:20.778
I mean, I should probably go, though,

30:18.233 --> 30:20.778
right?

30:20.819 --> 30:22.571
Early morning.

30:22.613 --> 30:25.115
You could go. But that seems like a dumb idea

30:22.613 --> 30:25.115
to me.

30:26.450 --> 30:28.452
-Mmm-hmm.

30:31.121 --> 30:35.208
Do I need to mail you a formal invitation?

30:35.250 --> 30:39.129
Come here. I request the pleasure of your company.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.991
Knock it off already. I know you're joking.

31:09.993 --> 31:12.538
Isobel, I swear, if you're playing around...

31:12.579 --> 31:15.248
Isobel Katherine Bloom, get your ass up off

31:12.579 --> 31:15.248
that floor!

31:16.458 --> 31:18.043
Mom?

31:18.084 --> 31:20.546
-I can't believe you came! -Oh, baby.

31:20.587 --> 31:22.840
It's so good to see you.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.384
-Psst, you're in my shot. -I've missed you so much.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.345
I'm so glad you're here.

31:28.387 --> 31:29.763
My little girl.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.058
I told you not to do this.

31:33.099 --> 31:35.018
Yeah, well... Tough.

31:36.854 --> 31:39.398
Why are you dressed like Peyton?

31:39.439 --> 31:40.733
It doesn't matter.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.693
Nice work.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.493
This, my friends,

31:51.535 --> 31:54.747
is what it looks like when a plan

31:51.535 --> 31:54.747
comes together.

31:55.664 --> 31:56.956
I know what some of you cynics

31:56.998 --> 31:58.542
might be saying. "A hundred cases

31:56.998 --> 31:58.542
of brain tubes?

31:58.584 --> 32:01.002
Is that all we have to show for this operation,

31:58.584 --> 32:01.002
Commander?"

32:01.044 --> 32:05.048
Well, you cynics would be forgetting about the traitors

32:01.044 --> 32:05.048
we've ferreted out.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.760
You're forgetting about your zombie brothers

32:05.090 --> 32:07.760
and sisters who will sleep

32:07.801 --> 32:09.845
with fuller bellies.

32:09.887 --> 32:13.390
But most of all, you don't know what's

32:09.887 --> 32:13.390
in these cases.

32:17.102 --> 32:18.854
So tonight,

32:18.896 --> 32:20.856
and just tonight,

32:20.898 --> 32:23.442
we've got you covered. Eat what you want!

32:23.483 --> 32:27.279
Drink what you want. It's all on Cobra Kai.

32:23.483 --> 32:27.279
Wait. That's not right.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.240
What were they called Where's Major?

32:27.320 --> 32:30.240
The man of the hour?

32:30.282 --> 32:32.992
-The Blue Cobras. -The Blue Cobras! That's it.

32:33.034 --> 32:35.412
Let's hear it for Lillywhite. He gets the job done.

32:39.249 --> 32:42.335
Hey, DJ! Play something from the aughts for this

32:39.249 --> 32:42.335
old soldier.

32:44.254 --> 32:45.422
Good job, man!

32:46.298 --> 32:47.716
Thank you.

32:53.889 --> 32:55.808
So, what do you say we get a picture with your team

32:55.849 --> 32:57.476
in front of the spoils of war, huh?

32:57.517 --> 32:59.185
We'll hang it up in the lounge.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.652
-There they are. -Get 'em, and let's do this.

33:12.491 --> 33:15.076
Your boys are asking for the good stuff.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.120
And I mean, like, the really good stuff.

33:17.162 --> 33:18.831
Whatever they want.

33:18.872 --> 33:20.499
I like your style.

33:32.761 --> 33:35.722
Sir, there's... There's been an incident.

33:35.764 --> 33:37.265
During the transport,

33:37.307 --> 33:39.726
Russ Roche managed to get his hands on a weapon,

33:39.768 --> 33:41.186
and he escaped.

33:41.227 --> 33:42.395
He what?

33:42.437 --> 33:43.563
Sir, I swear to you,

33:43.605 --> 33:44.940
I will personally find him and bring him--

33:44.982 --> 33:46.775
And whose weapon did he take?

33:46.817 --> 33:48.986
This is my squad, sir. It's my responsibility.

33:49.027 --> 33:52.280
-I will handle the discipline

33:49.027 --> 33:52.280
internally, sir.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.534
I said, whose weapon was it, Lillywhite?

33:58.119 --> 33:59.830
Mine, sir.

34:05.210 --> 34:08.338
Sir, I swear, I will find Roche and I will drag his ass right

34:05.210 --> 34:08.338
back to your office.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.716
Yes, you will.

34:24.479 --> 34:25.480
No!

36:45.120 --> 36:46.496
Tucker!

36:48.081 --> 36:50.792
Tucker! Please!

36:52.752 --> 36:53.670
Help me!

36:53.712 --> 36:54.796
Thank you, my son.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.342
What's he to you?

37:01.553 --> 37:03.055
Just...

37:04.931 --> 37:07.600
Just food, that's all.

37:16.317 --> 37:19.487
If you're wondering why I'm dressed like this,

37:16.317 --> 37:19.487
here's the reason.

37:19.529 --> 37:21.823
Isobel, driving lesson time.

37:32.584 --> 37:33.752
Oh, no.

37:46.139 --> 37:48.016
She's in the bedroom now.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.411
Isobel?

38:11.915 --> 38:13.959
It's not funny anymore.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.711
You're scaring us.

38:22.425 --> 38:23.927
You know...

38:26.888 --> 38:29.682
You might have them fooled.

38:29.724 --> 38:31.601
Two of them aren't even doctors.

38:35.605 --> 38:36.856
Now, come on.

38:42.487 --> 38:43.863
Eyes open.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.453
We've got work to do.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.003
Please.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.734
I never got to say goodbye.

39:56.978 --> 39:59.272
There's something I shot you two should see.

40:03.068 --> 40:05.486
<i> Levon?</i>

40:05.528 --> 40:09.241
<i>How you think these guys'll</i> <i>take it when I bite</i>

40:05.528 --> 40:09.241
<i>the big one?</i>

40:09.282 --> 40:13.786
<i> Honestly? I think</i> <i>they're gonna take it</i>

40:09.282 --> 40:13.786
<i>very, very hard.</i>

40:17.498 --> 40:19.918
<i>-Tell them not to--</i> <i>-You tell them.</i>

40:30.970 --> 40:33.973
<i>Liv, Ravi.</i>

40:35.183 --> 40:37.143
<i>Try not to be sad.</i>

40:37.185 --> 40:40.105
<i>Nobody's been</i> <i>luckier than me.</i>

40:40.146 --> 40:42.523
<i>I got to meet</i> <i>the two of you.</i>

40:42.565 --> 40:47.987
<i>And what did they say on</i> Zombie High<i> when</i>

40:42.565 --> 40:47.987
<i>Cornelia died?</i>

40:48.029 --> 40:50.782
"I'm just meat with a spark."

40:48.029 --> 40:50.782
<i>-"I'm just meat with a spark."</i>

40:50.907 --> 40:54.327
-"And then I'm not." <i>-"And then I'm not."</i>

40:54.369 --> 40:56.829
<i> Hits you right here,</i> <i>doesn't it?</i>

41:03.962 --> 41:05.338
<i>I love you guys.</i>
