00:41.340 --> 00:42.974
There are
three things that are absolute

00:43.007 --> 00:44.343
and cannot be destroyed.

00:45.010 --> 00:48.248
Awareness, being, and love.

00:49.447 --> 00:50.648
Rumi once wrote,

00:50.682 --> 00:54.520
"Gamble everything for love
if you're a true human being.

00:54.553 --> 00:56.788
Half-heartedness does
not reach into majesty."

00:58.389 --> 00:59.624
My mother would say,

00:59.657 --> 01:01.727
"The grass is only green if you
water it."

01:05.731 --> 01:07.734
At the beginning, everything
made sense.

01:09.001 --> 01:11.504
Your love, my love, our love.

01:14.772 --> 01:16.842
It had been 10 years since our
last visit.

01:18.477 --> 01:20.779
The previous one was to
celebrate our marriage.

01:21.546 --> 01:23.815
This one is an attempt
to heal the part of us

01:23.849 --> 01:25.050
that we'd lost.

01:31.490 --> 01:33.893
The beauty of an Italian
countryside hadn't changed

01:33.925 --> 01:35.627
but we had.

01:35.660 --> 01:36.895
We reached the point where truth

01:36.928 --> 01:39.031
became more important than
feelings,

01:39.064 --> 01:41.467
and winning became more
important than truth.

01:43.502 --> 01:44.370
But in truth,

01:46.638 --> 01:47.573
it was always love.

01:48.874 --> 01:49.742
Hmm.

01:51.710 --> 01:52.578
Here we were.

01:53.879 --> 01:56.883
I thought it would be
therapeutical.

02:00.918 --> 02:01.787
So.

02:02.820 --> 02:03.789
This is us.

02:05.490 --> 02:07.894
Is therapeutical
even a word?

02:14.566 --> 02:17.704
It's a therapeutic
substance.

02:19.505 --> 02:21.806
So that's what we are,
substance.

02:21.839 --> 02:23.342
As in a matter of thought.

02:24.108 --> 02:25.811
You know the point I was making.

02:26.911 --> 02:28.413
Trying to make.

02:28.447 --> 02:30.549
Yeah, always with the quixotic
words.

02:30.582 --> 02:31.517
Could have taken the easy route.

02:31.549 --> 02:34.452
Yeah well,
keeps 'em on their toes.

02:34.486 --> 02:35.488
Yes, you do.

02:38.891 --> 02:39.959
I need to pee.

02:41.793 --> 02:42.862
How long have we got?

02:42.894 --> 02:45.163
How long have we got until
what?

02:45.197 --> 02:46.031
Till I have to go?

02:46.064 --> 02:47.667
That's right now.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.934
Or until I pee myself, I don't
know.

02:49.968 --> 02:53.706
Last time that happened,
well, I was 12, so.

02:55.441 --> 02:56.709
You peed yourself at 12?

02:56.742 --> 02:57.943
Yeah I'd been drinking.

03:04.149 --> 03:06.151
We've only been on the road
for an hour,

03:06.185 --> 03:08.921
I mean you couldn't have
done it at the airport?

03:08.953 --> 03:09.821
I did.

03:12.691 --> 03:14.994
So we have to empty every
hour?

03:15.026 --> 03:16.428
I'm sorry, are we on a time
crunch?

03:16.462 --> 03:17.095
I wasn't aware.

03:17.129 --> 03:18.631
We are not, no.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.769
Just baffles me.

03:24.803 --> 03:26.572
You know, in fact it
baffles every man on earth.

03:26.605 --> 03:29.208
We pee before we hit the road.

03:29.240 --> 03:33.511
It saves us from stopping for
around four hours at least.

03:33.544 --> 03:35.947
You know, keeps the journey
moving.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.552
And your skin is looking 10
years older

03:39.584 --> 03:41.553
because you're never properly
hydrated.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.490
You just had the basics of
evolutionary differences.

03:46.892 --> 03:48.894
When's the last time you
had more than eight ounces

03:48.927 --> 03:50.196
of water in a day?

03:50.228 --> 03:52.064
Does coffee count?

03:52.096 --> 03:52.964
No.

03:56.635 --> 03:58.036
Can you hold it?

04:42.748 --> 04:44.950
You know, silence is

04:44.983 --> 04:47.887
the more regenerating, peaceful
option.

04:48.954 --> 04:49.989
It's pleasurable too.

04:50.022 --> 04:51.223
No.

04:51.255 --> 04:53.659
Isn't it great just to
hear the perfect song?

04:55.226 --> 04:57.562
Or a foreign voice just
sound like everything

04:57.596 --> 05:00.132
is from a Fellini film?

05:00.164 --> 05:02.567
Have you ever sat for
an entire Fellini film

05:02.601 --> 05:03.636
in your life?

05:03.668 --> 05:04.536
Be honest.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.839
Do you know any other Italian
director

05:07.873 --> 05:08.707
of classic cinema, huh?

05:08.740 --> 05:09.876
You be honest.

05:11.310 --> 05:16.281
Bertolucci, Zeffirelli,
Chabrol.

05:16.315 --> 05:18.216
The last one was French, but
well played

05:18.250 --> 05:19.151
on the other two.

05:20.618 --> 05:22.554
Man, you know me well.

05:22.587 --> 05:23.755
Better than anyone.

05:26.724 --> 05:28.693
Please, it's static.

05:28.726 --> 05:30.628
Just give me a minute, okay?

05:30.661 --> 05:33.132
If I don't find anything
that accents this view,

05:33.164 --> 05:34.732
it's the wind in your ears, I
promise.

05:34.765 --> 05:37.769
But I'm, I don't know, I'm
feeling it.

05:38.670 --> 05:39.572
Feeling something.

05:41.373 --> 05:42.575
Come on, FM.

05:43.642 --> 05:44.944
Gimme a sign.

05:44.976 --> 05:46.012
Gimme the perfect!

05:48.380 --> 05:49.248
Aha!

05:51.183 --> 05:52.817
Come on, huh?

05:52.851 --> 05:53.819
Right?

06:45.137 --> 06:46.005
Grazie.

06:48.940 --> 06:50.375
You'll inevitably eat my fries.

06:53.045 --> 06:54.080
Do you ever think that
they might be right,

06:54.113 --> 06:57.683
or that they are unequivocally,
hands down right?

06:57.716 --> 06:59.718
What, about us?

06:59.750 --> 07:03.856
About this, about this
whole thing we're doing.

07:03.889 --> 07:05.190
I guess if there were a
mandate

07:05.223 --> 07:06.993
for a couple who are no more,

07:07.793 --> 07:10.262
it may imply that statistically
this

07:11.762 --> 07:13.065
ain't even on the table, yeah.

07:13.098 --> 07:14.767
I mean, they might have a point.

07:15.767 --> 07:17.835
But we were never the
go-to couple for normal.

07:17.868 --> 07:18.936
Hmm, thank god.

07:18.969 --> 07:21.974
Thank god.

07:22.007 --> 07:24.910
Yeah, we were amazing.

07:24.942 --> 07:25.577
We were good.

07:25.611 --> 07:28.014
I don't know about amazing.

07:32.317 --> 07:33.719
My favorite thing to do

07:34.553 --> 07:36.288
was to go to some up your ass
event

07:36.320 --> 07:39.157
that neither of us wanted
to get out of sweats for.

07:39.190 --> 07:40.758
And you'd be taken away from me

07:40.791 --> 07:43.027
for just whatever reason.

07:43.060 --> 07:45.397
I could always find you
in a room full of people

07:45.430 --> 07:46.799
no matter who you were talking
to,

07:46.832 --> 07:49.735
you would look at me and wink.

07:49.767 --> 07:51.769
The wink is so underrated.

07:51.803 --> 07:53.805
People flee from the wink so
easily.

07:54.906 --> 07:56.242
Yours could change my world.

08:01.913 --> 08:04.450
Ugh, it just made me feel like

08:04.483 --> 08:07.219
we're the most important
people to each other.

08:08.786 --> 08:11.156
In that moment, no one else
mattered.

08:14.392 --> 08:16.028
I stand by it, we were amazing.

08:17.295 --> 08:18.931
People did envy our marriage.

08:20.164 --> 08:20.998
Did they?

08:21.031 --> 08:22.034
They did, yeah.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.269
'Cause you were that girl.

08:25.837 --> 08:28.272
You were the template
for all my friends' wives

08:28.305 --> 08:30.375
and girlfriends to match up to.

08:30.408 --> 08:32.044
Impossible task I tell them.

08:33.410 --> 08:35.914
Of course, any time a
conversation

08:35.946 --> 08:38.049
arose about the grievances of
the women,

08:39.251 --> 08:40.953
I would just sit there and
smirk,

08:40.985 --> 08:42.787
didn't feel the need to say
nothing.

08:44.488 --> 08:46.392
They all knew I had perfection
in you.

08:49.227 --> 08:51.329
That's why I fell so
hard when we derailed.

08:55.967 --> 08:59.038
Yeah, maybe that perfection
was hard to live up to.

09:00.104 --> 09:01.507
Yeah, maybe.

09:01.540 --> 09:02.408
We tried, Ryan.

09:04.441 --> 09:06.411
Both of us gave it everything we
had.

09:06.444 --> 09:07.313
I did.

09:08.847 --> 09:09.815
That's not fair.

09:09.848 --> 09:10.516
What? I did.

09:11.682 --> 09:14.519
The fundamental fact that
we all seem to miss is that

09:15.520 --> 09:16.889
when a man falls in love,

09:16.921 --> 09:19.291
that's genuinely it for him.

09:20.425 --> 09:21.926
No exceptions, actually.

09:23.094 --> 09:24.363
I mean if I'd ever cheated on
you

09:24.396 --> 09:25.930
or walked out the door,

09:25.964 --> 09:27.800
I wouldn't have been in love,
period.

09:29.935 --> 09:33.071
When I'm in love, I will
fight for everything.

09:34.439 --> 09:37.009
Now, it might not be pleasant at
times,

09:37.041 --> 09:38.344
perhaps a little murky, but

09:39.110 --> 09:41.312
the truth is if I can call you
baby

09:41.345 --> 09:43.414
in front of anyone and not give
a damn

09:43.448 --> 09:46.518
how stupid that sounds,

09:46.550 --> 09:48.853
there isn't much I wouldn't do

09:48.887 --> 09:49.988
to keep her,

09:53.592 --> 09:54.560
it, alive.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.402
You don't think I fought?

10:07.238 --> 10:08.339
I think you gave way.

10:12.209 --> 10:14.546
I never replaced you, Ryan.

10:16.013 --> 10:16.882
I know.

10:18.083 --> 10:20.118
You just leaned to someone else.

10:20.151 --> 10:21.020
I get it.

10:23.021 --> 10:24.289
I was absent.

10:24.321 --> 10:25.456
I got distracted and

10:26.590 --> 10:28.293
my feelings were denied somehow.

10:31.429 --> 10:34.099
It's hard not to feel a
swelling rage because of it.

10:36.468 --> 10:39.103
Feels like you found a
better choice, you know?

10:41.473 --> 10:42.141
It's easier to love a stranger

10:42.174 --> 10:44.476
than someone you actually know.

10:45.977 --> 10:47.179
Maybe.

10:47.211 --> 10:49.981
I know what
the wrongs are here.

10:50.015 --> 10:51.583
I would hope so.

10:51.616 --> 10:52.985
Look, it's not a matter of me

10:53.017 --> 10:54.652
trying to convince you of my
opinions,

10:54.685 --> 10:59.325
but I do have reasons, and
they're valid, entitled.

11:02.927 --> 11:06.430
With a stranger, you can
put all of these ideals

11:06.464 --> 11:09.233
and ideas onto a blank canvas

11:09.267 --> 11:11.435
without any of the hurtful
nuances

11:11.469 --> 11:14.138
that you've grown to
despise in your partner.

11:16.141 --> 11:20.279
But when you sit and
breathe and look at it

11:20.311 --> 11:22.914
from a rational space,

11:22.948 --> 11:26.351
you realize what an unbelievable
expectation that is.

11:26.383 --> 11:27.652
It's impossible.

11:29.353 --> 11:30.922
Maybe.

11:30.955 --> 11:32.224
Because we all have stuff.

11:32.257 --> 11:33.559
- Right.
- Right.

11:34.292 --> 11:36.394
We all are raised in different
ways

11:36.427 --> 11:39.998
and taught extreme truths.

11:40.031 --> 11:44.569
I mean how are you supposed
to love, marry, fuck

11:44.602 --> 11:47.472
someone from a completely
different world

11:47.504 --> 11:49.340
and assume it's gonna be an easy
ride?

11:49.373 --> 11:51.243
I mean you gotta be high.

11:53.511 --> 11:57.382
But if you're still holding
on to that hurt feeling,

11:59.150 --> 12:00.552
that swelling rage,

12:02.653 --> 12:04.088
babe, you gotta let it go.

12:07.592 --> 12:09.061
I didn't do it to hurt you.

12:10.561 --> 12:11.729
It was me.

12:11.762 --> 12:15.300
It was my things, my demons,

12:15.333 --> 12:18.704
my feelings of inadequacy.

12:24.142 --> 12:26.078
I know it sounds so trite to say

12:26.110 --> 12:27.511
that it didn't mean anything,

12:27.545 --> 12:32.117
but it didn't mean anything.

12:38.055 --> 12:39.190
And I'm sorry.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.064
I'm sorry for how it made
you feel, I really am.

12:59.076 --> 13:01.012
Didn't think we'd ever be back
here.

13:04.581 --> 13:06.417
Guess I thought we lost it.

13:06.450 --> 13:07.319
Yeah, me too.

13:08.619 --> 13:09.654
Glad we did not.

13:12.556 --> 13:14.425
How the fuck could we afford
such a decadent honeymoon

13:14.459 --> 13:15.292
in our 20s?

13:15.325 --> 13:16.661
Decadent?

13:16.694 --> 13:17.695
You didn't think so?

13:17.728 --> 13:20.565
It was a good honeymoon.

13:20.598 --> 13:21.599
It was a great honeymoon.

13:21.632 --> 13:24.402
Well, a great honeymoon
would have consisted

13:24.435 --> 13:26.537
of actual decadence.

13:26.570 --> 13:27.772
Wow, tough crowd.

13:29.339 --> 13:32.543
We did what we could.

13:32.576 --> 13:34.211
I wanted more.

13:34.244 --> 13:35.513
Yeah, like what?

13:35.546 --> 13:37.416
Crushing grapes beneath our
toes

13:37.449 --> 13:41.453
and bike rides to the pasticeria
for fresh baked pastry.

13:41.485 --> 13:43.454
Or falling
asleep under the stars?

13:43.488 --> 13:45.290
That was on the hood of the
car.

13:45.323 --> 13:46.391
Well at least it was warm.

13:46.424 --> 13:48.260
Well, we slept in that
car for like half the week.

13:48.292 --> 13:50.228
It was one night.

13:51.463 --> 13:52.731
We were getting older than we
wanted

13:52.763 --> 13:54.132
even in the earliest years.

14:00.371 --> 14:01.473
I found the letters.

14:13.251 --> 14:15.320
You never sent them to him.

14:15.353 --> 14:16.221
How come?

14:18.489 --> 14:19.690
I don't know.

14:20.892 --> 14:22.694
I knew how you would feel, I
guess.

14:24.796 --> 14:25.830
How I would feel.

14:31.268 --> 14:33.404
That's all I have for you.

14:34.472 --> 14:35.740
You think he was in love?

14:35.772 --> 14:36.841
- No.
- No?

14:38.575 --> 14:41.512
He knew it would never
get past infatuation.

14:41.546 --> 14:44.349
It was almost imaginary, to be
honest.

14:46.584 --> 14:48.752
He was just someone that
I could project onto,

14:48.786 --> 14:51.123
someone I thought would
encourage me,

14:51.790 --> 14:55.560
support me, congratulate me,

14:55.593 --> 14:58.229
applaud me to order as much
off a menu as I wanted.

15:01.199 --> 15:05.303
He was a non-smoker, he
loved yoga, I don't know.

15:05.335 --> 15:07.472
I don't know what else to tell
you, Ryan.

15:08.672 --> 15:10.908
It was just an impulse.

15:10.941 --> 15:13.778
It was a fantasy.

15:16.580 --> 15:17.483
It was an escape.

15:20.318 --> 15:22.221
And that's the truth, that's my
truth.

15:25.455 --> 15:26.325
It's all I got.

15:47.411 --> 15:49.547
Last time we were here,
you were 22 years old.

15:49.580 --> 15:51.282
Oh man, I remember her.

15:52.349 --> 15:53.317
That ass.

15:54.419 --> 15:55.720
She never lost that ass.

15:55.752 --> 15:56.954
All right, relax.

16:03.927 --> 16:04.796
Newman?

16:14.305 --> 16:15.540
Room number 117.

16:15.573 --> 16:17.309
Breakfast is come six.

16:17.342 --> 16:18.410
Perfect, Grazie.

16:19.410 --> 16:20.512
Ooh, they have bocce!

16:21.546 --> 16:22.781
They have a what now?

16:22.814 --> 16:23.714
Bocce!

16:23.748 --> 16:24.616
What, you never played?

16:24.648 --> 16:26.350
Where have you been hiding?

16:27.719 --> 16:28.719
Is there a bar?

16:28.752 --> 16:30.189
I seem to remember a bar.

16:31.022 --> 16:32.523
Ah, it's closed.

16:32.556 --> 16:33.425
What?

16:34.492 --> 16:36.294
Ah, well.

16:36.326 --> 16:38.296
Would have earned some money
out of me tonight, my friends.

16:38.329 --> 16:40.265
Oh yeah, with one shot Ryan

16:40.297 --> 16:43.767
I'm sure they'll be devastated
with the loss of revenue.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.470
You should be grateful
I don't drink that much.

16:46.503 --> 16:48.772
It's a passage of rites where I
come from.

16:48.805 --> 16:49.874
Where, Connecticut?

16:50.575 --> 16:52.411
Don't deny me my Irish roots.

16:53.344 --> 16:54.546
Okay, Oscar Wilde.

16:54.579 --> 16:55.447
Oscar?

16:56.613 --> 16:57.882
Was he Irish?

16:57.915 --> 16:59.384
Yeah, he was.

16:59.416 --> 17:00.285
Huh.

17:01.084 --> 17:03.421
Couldn't have gone with Bono,
hmm,

17:03.454 --> 17:05.457
or Liam Neeson perhaps.

17:05.489 --> 17:07.459
Eh, more fun to compare you to
Wilde.

17:07.491 --> 17:08.459
I could see that.

17:09.693 --> 17:10.560
Okay.

17:12.863 --> 17:13.731
This is us.

17:16.300 --> 17:16.969
Us?

17:18.670 --> 17:20.571
Relax, you're not that
irresistible.

17:22.507 --> 17:24.810
This isn't what the
trip was about, you know?

17:25.742 --> 17:26.611
I do.

17:30.047 --> 17:30.915
So?

17:34.986 --> 17:35.853
So.

17:37.721 --> 17:38.989
Do you think you can sleep next
to me

17:39.023 --> 17:41.426
without tearing my clothes off?

17:41.459 --> 17:44.962
Or do I have to pay for a
separate room?

17:46.530 --> 17:47.598
No spooning.

17:49.534 --> 17:51.637
My hands will remain
by my side all night.

17:53.004 --> 17:53.872
I know.

18:00.010 --> 18:01.812
I'm gonna wash 'em.

18:44.622 --> 18:45.489
Claudia?

19:10.448 --> 19:12.016
Good morning, handsome.

19:12.048 --> 19:12.917
Morning.

19:14.852 --> 19:16.521
You don't seem to be
very good at this game

19:16.554 --> 19:17.988
I've never heard of.

19:18.021 --> 19:18.822
Now how would you know?

19:18.855 --> 19:20.092
I'm awesome at it.

19:27.198 --> 19:28.166
What do you say we get out of
here

19:28.199 --> 19:29.500
before you're arrested?

19:30.668 --> 19:31.536
Yeah.

19:40.944 --> 19:43.881
I mean I don't blame her really.

19:43.914 --> 19:47.418
I think it's kind of normal
for them to fuck you up.

19:47.451 --> 19:48.519
It's their duty.

19:49.353 --> 19:51.088
Amazing set of parental
skills you'll have.

19:51.122 --> 19:52.056
Yeah, right?

19:53.557 --> 19:55.593
Look, I love my mom, I do.

19:55.625 --> 19:59.797
But just, the realistic
relationship that we have

19:59.831 --> 20:01.733
is not mother-daughter.

20:01.766 --> 20:02.667
It's?

20:02.700 --> 20:04.736
It's narcissist enabler.

20:04.768 --> 20:05.569
Hmm.

20:05.603 --> 20:06.804
I wish it wasn't true.

20:06.837 --> 20:10.408
I wish that we had a middle
of the road relationship, but,

20:11.709 --> 20:13.611
I mean I'm not even
asking for Margaret March,

20:13.643 --> 20:15.846
just someone that I can
learn something from.

20:16.713 --> 20:19.983
Okay two things, first,
Margaret who?

20:20.017 --> 20:21.052
March.

20:21.084 --> 20:22.554
The mom from Little Women.

20:23.388 --> 20:26.458
Yeah, that reference is always
gonna be a stretch for me.

20:26.490 --> 20:29.727
And second, I'm not buying
the lack of life lessons

20:29.759 --> 20:30.895
your mother taught you.

20:31.828 --> 20:34.065
You're this amazing woman who

20:34.097 --> 20:37.134
glides through life
apparently effortlessly.

20:37.168 --> 20:38.236
Mhm, sure.

20:38.268 --> 20:39.938
And thank you.

20:39.970 --> 20:41.940
And I'm not saying that she
didn't have any influence

20:41.972 --> 20:43.740
on how I become.

20:43.774 --> 20:47.111
She's just the last person
I would ever turn to

20:47.143 --> 20:48.747
for help or for anything.

20:50.248 --> 20:51.982
But she did show me
how to not be a parent,

20:52.016 --> 20:53.618
so there's that.

20:53.651 --> 20:54.952
Well, that's something.

20:54.986 --> 20:56.755
Yeah, that is something.

21:00.024 --> 21:02.594
Is anyone's being really
designed

21:02.626 --> 21:04.495
to be shaped, to morph and
evolve

21:04.528 --> 21:07.231
into the exact same
fabric as their parents?

21:07.265 --> 21:08.132
Who knows?

21:09.734 --> 21:11.870
'Cause I had a happy
childhood, I think.

21:12.769 --> 21:15.940
You know, dad is my hero,
mom was an angel, but

21:16.973 --> 21:18.542
I couldn't be more different.

21:19.776 --> 21:20.644
I hope so.

21:22.212 --> 21:23.714
Wow.

21:23.748 --> 21:24.582
Where do you wanna take that?

21:24.615 --> 21:26.651
I love your parents, but you
know,

21:26.683 --> 21:29.019
I would hope that the apple,
you,

21:29.053 --> 21:32.556
fell miles away from
that tree, your father.

21:32.590 --> 21:33.591
Poor guy.

21:33.623 --> 21:34.526
Why poor guy?

21:34.558 --> 21:36.661
Because, he's a good man, Cee.

21:37.961 --> 21:40.131
He's a great man, that's my
point.

21:40.163 --> 21:40.964
I love him, but you know

21:40.998 --> 21:43.535
he's made some choices in his
life

21:43.567 --> 21:44.768
that had been interesting,

21:44.803 --> 21:48.106
and I think you can see that
if you'd followed that example

21:48.139 --> 21:49.507
it could be a problem.

21:52.142 --> 21:53.010
For who?

21:54.144 --> 21:55.913
Anyone.

21:55.947 --> 21:56.715
So let me get this straight.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.549
My father cheats, and that puts
me

21:58.583 --> 21:59.584
on a watch and advise list?

21:59.617 --> 22:03.654
You were presented
with that at a young age.

22:03.688 --> 22:06.190
The formative years leave a big
footprint.

22:06.222 --> 22:09.594
We'll so does watching
it tear your mother apart.

22:09.626 --> 22:10.761
It's a personal choice, see.

22:10.795 --> 22:12.863
I am not my father.

22:12.896 --> 22:14.164
You're not your mother, so.

22:14.931 --> 22:16.668
So why spend time fighting the
fact

22:16.700 --> 22:18.937
that we both seem to be scared
to death

22:18.969 --> 22:19.637
of that being the case?

22:19.671 --> 22:23.575
I mean, if we are, we catch it.

22:23.607 --> 22:24.408
We become aware of it,

22:24.441 --> 22:27.077
and hopefully we're one step
closer

22:27.111 --> 22:28.813
to figuring that out than they
were.

22:28.845 --> 22:31.549
I mean, that's my gameplan.

22:32.248 --> 22:34.685
Living in the so be it?

22:34.719 --> 22:36.019
No.

22:36.053 --> 22:37.287
But not grabbing it by the
throat

22:37.321 --> 22:39.958
and shaking the air out of it
either.

22:39.990 --> 22:42.093
No, by letting go.

22:43.326 --> 22:44.228
It's not so be it.

22:44.260 --> 22:47.298
So be it is to acquiesce.

22:49.065 --> 22:51.769
I just don't let it have
that much of a hold over me.

22:53.069 --> 22:54.972
Anyway, could be worse.

22:55.006 --> 22:55.840
Could it?

22:55.873 --> 22:56.708
Absolutely.

22:56.740 --> 22:57.875
I could be my Grandpa.

22:58.843 --> 22:59.677
What, Frank?

22:59.709 --> 23:00.344
Oh, no, no, no, no.

23:00.378 --> 23:01.780
No, Frank, he's off limits.

23:02.813 --> 23:03.748
He's a sweetheart.

23:04.582 --> 23:07.118
No, William Deeks Newman, dad's
dad.

23:08.686 --> 23:10.388
We've never talked about him
much.

23:10.421 --> 23:12.023
How come?

23:12.055 --> 23:14.057
I don't know.

23:14.091 --> 23:15.727
He died when dad was a teen.

23:18.362 --> 23:19.764
You know I don't really remember
seeing

23:19.796 --> 23:22.033
more than one picture
of him around the house.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.002
I never met him, obviously.

23:25.702 --> 23:27.671
Heard he was a complete
scoundrel.

23:28.605 --> 23:33.010
And cloth merchant, gambling
man, perpetual philanderer.

23:33.745 --> 23:36.414
Now those are genes you
don't want bequeathed.

23:36.447 --> 23:39.250
I am sure, like all
the Newman men I have met

23:39.283 --> 23:41.185
he has his charms.

23:41.218 --> 23:42.987
I have no doubt, no.

23:43.019 --> 23:45.757
But that bloodline, had to be
diluted

23:45.789 --> 23:49.993
otherwise we'd all end up living
alone.

23:50.026 --> 23:51.929
Yeah, women's lib was
brought to the surface

23:51.961 --> 23:53.698
because of men like Grandpa
Bill.

23:55.098 --> 23:55.966
Could be worse.

24:16.453 --> 24:18.055
You see that?

24:18.088 --> 24:20.023
A private vineyard?

24:20.056 --> 24:21.892
You like spontaneity.

24:21.926 --> 24:24.229
Yeah, I also like not being
shot at.

24:24.929 --> 24:27.431
2018, Claudia, not the civil
war.

24:36.907 --> 24:38.309
Now this is Italy.

24:39.876 --> 24:41.812
We're trespassing.

24:41.845 --> 24:44.281
It's worth every moment
in solitary confinement.

24:49.886 --> 24:51.988
Where are we going?

24:52.021 --> 24:53.390
We, Mrs. Newman,

24:54.091 --> 24:56.094
are gonna have the great
honeymoon.

24:56.794 --> 24:58.329
I'm not living my life with the
regret

24:58.362 --> 24:59.797
of having just a good one.

25:00.530 --> 25:01.398
Are you in?

25:02.499 --> 25:05.069
That's sweet, but,

25:07.004 --> 25:07.872
But what?

25:10.874 --> 25:14.045
I thought that we agreed
that this isn't about this.

25:15.546 --> 25:16.413
It's not.

25:17.413 --> 25:19.517
But can't we at least enjoy

25:19.549 --> 25:21.219
and celebrate our lives
together?

25:23.254 --> 25:24.289
We're not together.

25:27.458 --> 25:28.325
I know.

25:30.561 --> 25:33.898
But I also know that most
people travel through this world

25:33.930 --> 25:35.065
living in that regret.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.203
Like I said, I don't wanna do
that.

25:41.404 --> 25:43.540
Just because we're not together

25:43.574 --> 25:45.942
doesn't mean we can't creatively
cull

25:45.976 --> 25:47.311
new experiences with one
another.

25:47.344 --> 25:50.248
I mean, memories are
all we'll have one day.

25:53.918 --> 25:54.786
Hey.

25:55.819 --> 25:57.254
This doesn't mean any more

25:57.287 --> 26:00.024
than two people who've spent 30
percent

26:00.056 --> 26:01.858
of their lives together

26:01.892 --> 26:03.827
enjoying and celebrating that
fact.

26:05.429 --> 26:07.430
We can go back to the car,

26:07.463 --> 26:10.300
turn around, continue the
journey if you prefer, or,

26:12.001 --> 26:14.305
we put all that shit that
we carry to one side,

26:15.038 --> 26:17.808
and actually enjoy each other's
company,

26:17.842 --> 26:19.209
doing the things that
we never paid attention

26:19.242 --> 26:20.911
to not doing in the first place.

26:23.380 --> 26:26.017
So you wanna crush grapes
between your toes or not?

26:28.017 --> 26:28.886
Where?

26:29.953 --> 26:30.821
Here.

26:32.122 --> 26:33.024
Here?

26:33.056 --> 26:33.924
Yeah.

26:38.495 --> 26:41.498
Unfortunately science
has taken over the world.

26:41.532 --> 26:43.267
So the only place you can stomp
now

26:43.299 --> 26:46.002
without a tour guide or losing a
toe is

26:46.036 --> 26:49.340
somewhere private, somewhere
quiet,

26:51.307 --> 26:52.176
somewhere here.

26:55.880 --> 26:58.315
Look, I can't guarantee we'll
make anything worth drinking

26:58.348 --> 26:59.983
but what I can guarantee is

27:02.052 --> 27:03.353
you'll remember the moment.

27:06.623 --> 27:07.491
Ready to Pigeage?

27:11.562 --> 27:13.264
Smooth talker, Ryan Newman.

27:14.398 --> 27:15.399
You're a real smooth talker.

27:15.431 --> 27:16.300
Mhmm.

28:30.574 --> 28:31.441
Mhmm.

28:39.415 --> 28:40.951
Feels good, right?

28:40.985 --> 28:43.254
Yeah, like all my
birthdays rolled into one.

28:44.388 --> 28:47.124
If that's some gentle sarcasm,
go easy.

28:47.157 --> 28:50.061
If not, I'll take it as
the highest compliment

28:50.094 --> 28:52.563
from the girl who
celebrates their birthday

28:52.595 --> 28:53.964
the entire month.

28:53.998 --> 28:55.199
Greatest month ever.

28:55.232 --> 28:58.335
You never saw the upside of
the celebratory birthday month.

28:58.369 --> 29:00.939
I don't know how you
have the energy, honestly.

29:01.838 --> 29:03.573
An hour into any party I'm
involved with

29:03.606 --> 29:05.675
and I'm looking for the fire
exit.

29:05.709 --> 29:10.014
Plus, in my house, it's
plethoric as Christmas.

29:10.046 --> 29:12.482
Mine lasted until noon.

29:12.516 --> 29:15.085
I feel like you made up for it
though.

29:15.119 --> 29:16.587
What's that mean?

29:16.620 --> 29:17.988
Now how do I say this?

29:19.390 --> 29:24.061
You ladies tend to be
celebrated a little excessively.

29:24.094 --> 29:29.033
Okay, tread careful,
Jean Jacque misogynist.

29:29.065 --> 29:30.601
Ooh, squishy, ooh.

29:30.633 --> 29:31.469
Is it cold?

29:31.501 --> 29:32.335
Yeah.

29:32.369 --> 29:33.237
Let me in.

29:37.807 --> 29:39.344
That feels nice.

29:51.587 --> 29:52.489
So you don't think

29:53.690 --> 29:55.293
we need more of a celebration?

29:56.727 --> 29:58.463
I think it's important.

29:59.630 --> 30:01.565
To celebrate all of them?

30:01.597 --> 30:04.768
Birthdays, anniversaries,
Valentines.

30:04.802 --> 30:07.138
I mean you can literally
buy me a shot of rye

30:07.171 --> 30:08.238
and a baseball ticket,

30:08.271 --> 30:10.540
throw in a steak and you're
golden.

30:10.574 --> 30:12.209
But a celebration weekend with
the girls,

30:12.241 --> 30:14.277
that takes a lot of
pre-planning.

30:15.179 --> 30:18.482
You got e-vites, balloons,

30:18.515 --> 30:20.785
paper bags overflowing with
all that matching tissue,

30:20.817 --> 30:22.185
I've never understood it.

30:22.219 --> 30:24.354
And if you're really dealing
with a pro,

30:24.388 --> 30:26.324
handpicked invite cards with
the,

30:27.557 --> 30:28.725
the raised type, what's that
called?

30:28.758 --> 30:29.660
What?

30:29.693 --> 30:32.195
You know, on the
invites, on the letters,

30:32.228 --> 30:33.163
it feels like Braille.

30:33.197 --> 30:34.098
It's embossing.

30:34.132 --> 30:35.632
Nothing like Braille but please
continue.

30:35.665 --> 30:37.167
Yeah, embossed lettering.

30:38.199 --> 30:39.702
And then of course, travel
arrangements.

30:39.736 --> 30:42.739
Hotel reservations, dinner
reservations.

30:42.773 --> 30:44.842
Show tickets, Pilates classes.

30:44.874 --> 30:46.776
All strategically planned to the
minute.

30:46.809 --> 30:50.613
We literally raise a glass,
done.

30:50.646 --> 30:52.615
Our birthdays, as adults,

30:52.649 --> 30:54.151
they're over by midnight.

30:54.183 --> 30:55.485
Now the party itself might not
be

30:55.518 --> 30:59.222
but the celebration of the
birthday, done.

30:59.256 --> 31:03.094
Well, your gender is missing
out.

31:03.126 --> 31:05.128
I'm sure your parents
made a big deal about it.

31:05.161 --> 31:06.430
What, as a kid?

31:06.462 --> 31:07.330
Yeah.

31:08.065 --> 31:11.501
Sure, but, it stopped in high
school.

31:11.535 --> 31:12.402
Yours?

31:13.769 --> 31:15.439
I remember a solid couple.

31:15.471 --> 31:16.706
There's a cake occasionally.

31:16.739 --> 31:17.740
I mean you've been
around for a few of them.

31:17.774 --> 31:20.844
It's a phone call.

31:22.246 --> 31:24.315
A card maybe.

31:24.347 --> 31:26.883
If you're really lucky you get
the

31:26.917 --> 31:30.288
"go get yourself something and
I'll send a check" routine.

31:31.921 --> 31:36.094
I must have been about nine or
10.

31:38.929 --> 31:39.831
And I woke up,

31:42.266 --> 31:44.767
I was so excited, it
was just the best day.

31:44.801 --> 31:47.605
It didn't matter if you
had to go to school,

31:47.638 --> 31:49.440
bring your birthday gift and

31:49.472 --> 31:51.875
teacher would make a big fuss
over it

31:51.909 --> 31:56.380
and just felt like you
could accomplish anything.

31:56.412 --> 31:57.914
So I get up that morning and I
run

31:57.948 --> 31:59.083
into my parents' room.

31:59.115 --> 32:03.121
Dad's already at work and
mom is laying in bed awake.

32:03.953 --> 32:06.123
And she says so sweetly,

32:07.790 --> 32:09.126
"Happy birthday, baby."

32:11.795 --> 32:13.397
And then she goes on to say that

32:13.430 --> 32:16.167
you know, things are tight that
month

32:16.200 --> 32:18.568
and can they get me my
present in a couple of weeks

32:18.602 --> 32:22.339
when finances are more balanced.

32:22.372 --> 32:24.507
I was crushed.

32:24.540 --> 32:25.708
But I was a sweet kid

32:25.741 --> 32:27.443
and I wanted to understand.

32:27.477 --> 32:29.880
And I thought if I was just
patient

32:29.912 --> 32:30.980
and I could understand,

32:31.014 --> 32:35.152
that maybe in a couple weeks
I would end up with some

32:36.786 --> 32:39.422
really wonderful present.

32:39.456 --> 32:43.627
And so I counted down the days,
or weeks.

32:43.660 --> 32:45.930
And then the morning came and

32:47.463 --> 32:48.431
there was nothing.

32:49.932 --> 32:51.902
Just no mention of it at all.

32:53.670 --> 32:56.673
They'd completely forgotten this
promise

32:56.707 --> 32:59.477
that they made to a little girl.

33:00.876 --> 33:01.945
I was destroyed.

33:05.582 --> 33:06.851
And they had no idea.

33:08.919 --> 33:12.456
I guess my self-healing
mechanism

33:12.488 --> 33:14.558
was engrained at a pretty young
age.

33:17.628 --> 33:19.263
That's a sad story, Cee.

33:21.030 --> 33:24.000
You ever ask them about it?

33:24.034 --> 33:24.869
No.

33:25.869 --> 33:26.971
Took it on the chin.

33:28.805 --> 33:31.941
I thought that they would
maybe eventually remember.

33:31.975 --> 33:33.510
Or not, I don't know,

33:33.543 --> 33:36.247
some sort of weird self-pity.

33:36.279 --> 33:38.315
Oh, I know that.

33:38.347 --> 33:40.217
Where it almost feels good to
suffer.

33:40.984 --> 33:42.253
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

33:50.794 --> 33:53.331
I guess if you were to
look at it rationally,

33:54.597 --> 33:56.366
your parents were probably
heartbroken

33:56.400 --> 33:59.303
when they couldn't afford to
buy their kid a toy, you know?

33:59.335 --> 34:00.970
Yeah, they were kids
themselves.

34:01.004 --> 34:03.707
I mean it was that
generation where everyone

34:03.739 --> 34:05.308
had children in their 20s.

34:05.342 --> 34:07.745
They had a mortgage and two
girls.

34:07.777 --> 34:10.947
Now I feel sorry for them.

34:10.980 --> 34:14.384
That makes sense to me though.

34:14.417 --> 34:15.451
Now I know why you get pissy

34:15.484 --> 34:16.985
when you get gifts you don't
like.

34:17.020 --> 34:18.422
I don't, that's not,

34:18.455 --> 34:19.757
okay, it's not that I don't like
it.

34:19.790 --> 34:22.293
It's that I give them options

34:22.326 --> 34:23.893
when they ask me what I want.

34:23.926 --> 34:25.527
And then the day comes,

34:25.562 --> 34:27.498
and it's something
completely off the radar

34:27.531 --> 34:29.699
from somewhere just, you know,
convenient.

34:30.966 --> 34:32.568
My family likes the easy
purchase.

34:32.601 --> 34:34.304
God forbid that they have to
walk

34:34.337 --> 34:36.572
to the far end of the mall.

34:36.605 --> 34:37.908
On the plus side, it has made
you

34:37.940 --> 34:39.542
an excellent gift giver.

34:39.576 --> 34:40.444
Oh, I know.

34:42.779 --> 34:43.914
You too, though.

34:43.946 --> 34:45.081
Yeah?

34:45.114 --> 34:47.551
Yeah, you always seem to
know what's needed and when.

34:48.984 --> 34:50.587
And you know romance.

34:53.589 --> 34:54.725
Where'd that come from?

34:56.625 --> 34:57.495
I don't know.

34:58.527 --> 35:00.763
I grew into it, I guess.

35:00.797 --> 35:02.033
I had a lot of charm.

35:07.536 --> 35:08.471
Your proposal.

35:10.774 --> 35:12.042
Ugh, still takes my breath.

35:12.075 --> 35:13.710
Yeah?

35:13.743 --> 35:15.613
I love to hear you tell that
story.

35:16.812 --> 35:17.681
Tell me.

35:19.049 --> 35:19.984
Really?

35:21.484 --> 35:22.719
Yeah, tell me your version.

35:22.752 --> 35:25.622
I don't think I ever
heard you talk about it.

35:26.756 --> 35:27.957
'Cause it was mine.

35:29.459 --> 35:30.527
It was my version.

35:34.131 --> 35:36.701
I wanted to keep that one for
myself.

35:56.852 --> 35:59.456
You
said you had a business trip.

36:00.924 --> 36:02.860
You said you'd be back in two
days.

36:04.828 --> 36:06.663
When you called, I felt guilty.

36:07.497 --> 36:09.565
I was happy that you were
frustrated,

36:09.598 --> 36:11.468
happy that you wanted to come
home.

36:15.105 --> 36:16.607
You told me you were tired.

36:18.073 --> 36:18.974
Tired of it all,

36:19.009 --> 36:21.078
and the one thing that can make
you smile

36:21.111 --> 36:22.747
was to spend the night with me.

36:25.181 --> 36:26.049
I glowed.

36:27.984 --> 36:29.686
You asked me to meet you at the
airport

36:29.718 --> 36:31.621
but you only had one request.

36:36.826 --> 36:37.895
Wear the red dress.

36:41.163 --> 36:43.433
There
never was a conference.

36:43.466 --> 36:45.535
There never was a business trip.

36:47.937 --> 36:50.006
At first I thought it was a
mistake.

36:50.040 --> 36:51.909
A woman is walking towards me

36:51.942 --> 36:53.744
as I stood waiting in the
terminal.

36:54.777 --> 36:56.113
She looked at no one else.

36:57.547 --> 36:59.450
Her smile was bright and warm.

37:00.350 --> 37:03.554
She said nothing as she
handed me my favorite flower.

37:06.656 --> 37:07.525
Peonies.

37:13.997 --> 37:15.732
It made
sense to me.

37:17.801 --> 37:18.701
I watched her walk away

37:18.736 --> 37:22.105
as I held the flower, knowing it
was mine.

37:24.241 --> 37:26.877
Then an older gentleman
walked the same path

37:26.910 --> 37:31.181
and gave me another,
a third, and a fourth.

37:32.216 --> 37:35.553
It took until the fifth
person for me to become aware.

37:38.721 --> 37:40.957
My tears poured down my face.

37:40.991 --> 37:44.061
Undoubtedly the single most
beautiful moment of my life.

37:47.864 --> 37:52.069
133 flowers were put into my
arms from complete strangers

37:52.102 --> 37:55.071
who offered nothing more but a
smile.

37:57.741 --> 37:59.543
And then it happened.

38:02.145 --> 38:04.147
The moment I knew I met the man

38:04.180 --> 38:06.049
I wanted to spend my life with.

38:14.323 --> 38:16.859
I hadn't seen my dad in over six
months.

38:16.893 --> 38:20.030
I didn't, not for one
moment think it wasn't him.

38:22.832 --> 38:23.701
I knew.

38:25.167 --> 38:28.971
And I knew that you had brought
him to me.

38:29.004 --> 38:33.042
Mom had the greatest smile
I had seen on her for years.

38:34.777 --> 38:36.013
Daddy was still.

38:37.113 --> 38:39.116
A tear on his face showed me his
love.

38:41.951 --> 38:43.553
The world stopped.

38:44.988 --> 38:47.190
My face ached with elation.

38:52.194 --> 38:53.062
Hi, Daddy.

39:04.774 --> 39:05.843
And there you were.

39:08.678 --> 39:10.013
My heart slowed.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.716
The world became silent.

39:14.917 --> 39:17.555
That very moment was as it
should be.

39:19.055 --> 39:20.857
I didn't even wait for you to
ask.

39:23.759 --> 39:26.229
- I just said yes.
- You just said yes.

39:29.332 --> 39:31.000
He
had contacted my family

39:31.033 --> 39:32.368
two days prior.

39:32.402 --> 39:36.140
He flew in and asked my father
for my hand in marriage.

39:38.073 --> 39:40.142
He had spoken with the airline
in advance

39:40.176 --> 39:41.844
and told them of his plan.

39:42.645 --> 39:45.349
He asked if the stewardess
could make an announcement

39:45.381 --> 39:48.084
to all of the passengers in
flight.

39:48.118 --> 39:50.087
Of course everyone knew it was
special.

39:52.422 --> 39:54.057
The stewardess told the
passengers

39:54.089 --> 39:56.692
that a young man was going
to propose to his girlfriend

39:56.725 --> 39:59.061
when they landed, and that
he had her parents with him

39:59.094 --> 40:00.830
after asking for her hand.

40:03.899 --> 40:05.368
She explained that the girl in
question

40:05.402 --> 40:07.771
would be waiting at the arrival
gate

40:07.803 --> 40:08.972
wearing a red dress.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.975
Each person would be given one
stem.

40:13.009 --> 40:15.112
All they had to do was
walk toward the girl

40:15.145 --> 40:16.747
and without saying a word,

40:18.814 --> 40:19.882
hand her the flower.

40:21.817 --> 40:22.986
Everybody loves romance.

40:24.988 --> 40:26.256
Everybody loves love.

40:28.792 --> 40:29.893
One by one they came.

40:32.995 --> 40:34.631
And the girl in the red dress,

40:36.899 --> 40:38.434
she will never forget what the
man said

40:38.468 --> 40:40.803
as they walked away
toward their happiness.

40:45.040 --> 40:48.077
"Turns out, it was all about a
girl."

41:03.792 --> 41:05.995
Hey I'm gonna go down to the
bar.

41:06.029 --> 41:07.797
You want me to order you
anything?

41:17.339 --> 41:19.343
I'll see you downstairs.

42:41.123 --> 42:42.459
Hi.

42:42.491 --> 42:43.359
Hi.

42:46.462 --> 42:48.132
Cabernet, please.

42:50.933 --> 42:52.002
You have kind eyes.

42:53.002 --> 42:54.270
I do, huh?

42:54.303 --> 42:55.171
You do.

42:55.971 --> 42:59.209
They change colors too, did you
know that?

42:59.241 --> 43:00.176
No.

43:00.210 --> 43:01.078
They do.

43:01.745 --> 43:04.114
During the day they're deep
brown

43:04.147 --> 43:07.284
then in the evening, just
as the temperature drops

43:07.317 --> 43:10.020
they have almost a green hue to
them.

43:11.154 --> 43:12.189
Green, I've never heard that.

43:12.221 --> 43:13.489
Mhmm, green.

43:13.522 --> 43:14.390
Hazel green.

43:17.060 --> 43:18.328
How was your shower?

43:18.361 --> 43:20.564
Oh, everything I ever dreamed
of.

43:22.165 --> 43:23.233
Not drinking?

43:24.399 --> 43:27.203
I think that we possibly
turned those grapes into wine,

43:27.236 --> 43:29.872
I wanna sit back and let
others enjoy our work.

43:34.977 --> 43:35.845
You okay?

43:36.946 --> 43:38.381
I am, yeah.

43:38.413 --> 43:39.283
You?

43:46.890 --> 43:47.558
Grazie.

43:49.392 --> 43:54.064
I don't know, one moment I'm
fine, then,

43:54.096 --> 43:55.098
Then what?

43:57.466 --> 44:00.002
Then the reality puts
its foot on my throat

44:00.035 --> 44:01.070
and I can't breathe.

44:02.906 --> 44:04.274
I literally can't breathe.

44:07.210 --> 44:08.645
Sometimes I'm strong about it,

44:08.678 --> 44:10.480
I'm so fucking strong and I'm

44:11.948 --> 44:14.551
ready to move on, I'm happy to
move on.

44:18.520 --> 44:20.189
But then there's moments where
I'm just,

44:22.524 --> 44:26.128
covered in grief, and I feel
panic.

44:29.131 --> 44:31.634
Like I was just in a car
accident panic.

44:34.404 --> 44:36.306
And I don't know what to do,
Claudia.

44:38.308 --> 44:39.276
I know that pain.

44:40.643 --> 44:41.511
You do?

44:43.546 --> 44:44.480
It burns.

44:47.049 --> 44:48.584
That's a good way of
describing it, yeah.

44:48.618 --> 44:50.353
It does, it burns.

44:51.321 --> 44:55.625
Shame, regret, wishful thinking.

44:58.393 --> 45:00.562
All of it erodes your insides.

45:00.596 --> 45:02.099
I feel it too.

45:10.038 --> 45:12.008
Why didn't you begin the process
sooner?

45:15.410 --> 45:16.279
I'm not sure.

45:18.580 --> 45:20.416
I guess that's why we're here,
right?

45:21.417 --> 45:24.054
Yeah.

45:24.087 --> 45:25.589
Will you be eating with us
tonight?

45:27.189 --> 45:28.624
Hi.

45:28.658 --> 45:29.526
Hi.

45:30.526 --> 45:32.062
I'm sorry.

45:32.094 --> 45:35.031
No, I'm just here for the
drinks, I think.

45:35.064 --> 45:36.165
I see.

45:36.198 --> 45:37.700
If you change your mind, I'm
Annie.

45:37.734 --> 45:39.268
We know where to find you.

45:45.341 --> 45:46.310
She's beautiful.

45:49.277 --> 45:50.147
She is, yeah.

45:51.781 --> 45:53.183
You should talk to her.

45:54.384 --> 45:55.185
What are you doing?

45:55.218 --> 45:56.053
- You should.
- Claudia, come on.

45:56.085 --> 45:59.022
Hey, you don't owe me
anything, Ryan.

45:59.055 --> 46:00.357
This is... you know?

46:03.792 --> 46:06.997
Look, I had a wonderful day
today, truly.

46:07.029 --> 46:08.131
Perfectly fitting.

46:09.064 --> 46:10.200
But we shouldn't dwell.

46:11.634 --> 46:14.371
It's part of our evolution,
it's part of our healing.

46:17.406 --> 46:19.408
You know that feeling that you
just got?

46:21.243 --> 46:24.213
The excitement that you felt

46:24.247 --> 46:26.450
and a new beginning just
starting to blossom?

46:29.285 --> 46:31.053
Well those are feelings
that you should hold onto.

46:31.087 --> 46:33.090
Those are the ones that matter
the most.

46:35.290 --> 46:38.227
Just go talk to her.

46:38.261 --> 46:43.266
I understand.

46:44.533 --> 46:47.269
There's nothing to understand.

46:48.069 --> 46:50.372
Look, I'm wise enough to know
the meaning

46:50.406 --> 46:51.608
of a fleeting emotion.

46:52.808 --> 46:54.343
And we are old enough to be able

46:54.377 --> 46:55.712
to recognize its truth, so,

46:57.580 --> 46:59.181
can you stop, please?

47:01.817 --> 47:03.520
I loved you for 10 years.

47:05.321 --> 47:07.257
I'm sure I'll love you for many
more.

47:09.257 --> 47:11.761
But, for now,

47:13.096 --> 47:17.067
I'm gonna take my aged wise
truth

47:17.100 --> 47:18.134
and go to bed.

47:55.270 --> 47:56.138
Cee.

48:30.473 --> 48:31.808
Morning.

48:31.841 --> 48:32.709
Morning.

48:36.279 --> 48:37.547
You're up early.

48:37.580 --> 48:38.848
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

48:39.881 --> 48:41.417
Wanted to catch the sunrise.

48:43.185 --> 48:44.620
Did you?

48:44.654 --> 48:46.156
In all its glory.

48:50.393 --> 48:51.361
How was your night?

48:55.263 --> 48:56.799
What do you think?

48:58.768 --> 49:02.506
I want to think I'm open,
evolved,

49:03.638 --> 49:05.642
mature and wise.

49:05.674 --> 49:09.845
That I have accepted everything,
moved on

49:09.879 --> 49:10.714
above it all.

49:12.781 --> 49:13.649
I'm not.

49:18.654 --> 49:20.590
Nothing happened.

49:20.622 --> 49:21.690
Ryan, it's okay.

49:23.692 --> 49:24.560
I know.

49:25.594 --> 49:26.930
Nothing happened.

49:29.799 --> 49:30.667
Come on.

49:34.370 --> 49:35.572
Is everything okay?

49:35.605 --> 49:37.273
I'm a little raw.

49:37.306 --> 49:40.210
The memories hurt on this fine
morning.

49:40.243 --> 49:41.777
I'll be okay.

49:41.810 --> 49:43.779
You don't wanna talk about it?

49:43.812 --> 49:44.646
I do.

49:44.680 --> 49:45.515
But not yet.

49:45.547 --> 49:46.415
Why not?

49:47.616 --> 49:48.450
Come on, Claudia.

49:48.484 --> 49:49.485
No, why?

49:49.518 --> 49:51.955
Because, I have emotions
attached

49:51.988 --> 49:54.591
and if I spoke about it right
now,

49:54.623 --> 49:56.792
we'll end up in a fight
and I don't wanna do that.

49:56.826 --> 49:59.429
How do you
know it'll end up there?

49:59.462 --> 50:01.331
Because you'll get defensive.

50:01.364 --> 50:02.932
You're prophesying.

50:02.964 --> 50:05.567
No, no, I'm going on
experience,

50:05.600 --> 50:08.337
very factual proven experience.

50:08.370 --> 50:09.605
That's not fair.

50:13.875 --> 50:15.946
Okay, you want in, here goes.

50:17.513 --> 50:20.650
I still feel the need to
talk about the letters.

50:22.585 --> 50:25.655
I need to dig deep and try to
make peace.

50:26.888 --> 50:28.890
Maybe if I can learn a little
more

50:28.924 --> 50:29.893
I can heal from it.

50:31.560 --> 50:33.029
Yeah well I can't guarantee
healing

50:33.062 --> 50:34.931
but if we open it up

50:34.964 --> 50:37.400
maybe I can help you understand.

50:39.567 --> 50:40.437
Maybe.

50:41.636 --> 50:43.539
Guess I just need to hear what I
did.

50:44.473 --> 50:46.409
You know what you did.

50:46.442 --> 50:47.344
You disappeared.

50:48.343 --> 50:49.311
As did you.

50:49.344 --> 50:51.814
Not when you needed me most.

50:51.846 --> 50:52.848
That's not true.

50:52.881 --> 50:53.715
Really?

50:53.748 --> 50:55.285
Yeah.

50:55.317 --> 50:57.821
I needed you most when my
fucking heart was broken.

50:58.654 --> 51:00.422
I needed you most when you would
come home

51:00.455 --> 51:01.857
and our stubbornness was on full
tilt

51:01.890 --> 51:03.459
and you refused to give me a
reason.

51:03.491 --> 51:06.995
I needed you most when you
were in the hospital bed

51:07.029 --> 51:09.032
and I was the only one making
decisions.

51:09.931 --> 51:11.700
And it's through all
of that you disappeared

51:11.734 --> 51:12.736
and where were you?

51:14.469 --> 51:16.638
You were lost reading love poems

51:16.672 --> 51:20.376
from some guy who didn't
know a damn thing about you,

51:20.408 --> 51:23.779
some jerkoff who wanted to play
house.

51:24.881 --> 51:29.419
You'll never truly understand
how that felt for me.

51:29.451 --> 51:30.886
So by you saying that I
disappeared

51:30.919 --> 51:31.820
when you needed me most,

51:31.855 --> 51:34.991
and by disappeared you meant I
withdrew, W

51:35.024 --> 51:37.426
and you were mad at me for not
hearing you on certain things

51:37.460 --> 51:39.529
then yeah, you're right, I did
do that.

51:39.562 --> 51:41.864
But only because I was
desperately trying

51:41.897 --> 51:43.433
to figure out our next step.

51:45.701 --> 51:47.370
So then what, huh?

51:47.402 --> 51:48.305
You get scorned.

51:49.772 --> 51:51.474
And you show me you
have a killer left hook

51:51.506 --> 51:52.374
with a payback?

51:53.808 --> 51:54.810
You win, Cee.

51:56.411 --> 51:57.547
I'm not fully present,

51:57.580 --> 52:00.350
then you'll show me withdrawal,
right?

52:00.382 --> 52:01.683
- No.
- Really?

52:01.716 --> 52:05.754
No, his letters made
something in me bloom.

52:05.788 --> 52:08.791
It was fleeting.

52:08.823 --> 52:11.059
I wrote them back to him in a
space

52:11.093 --> 52:12.562
of my own heartbreak.

52:13.928 --> 52:15.997
It eased that, my heart,
the one that you broke.

52:16.031 --> 52:17.799
I knew that we were coming to
the end

52:17.832 --> 52:20.803
and his attention felt
like comfort, just comfort.

52:23.439 --> 52:24.841
Look, I'm a smart person.

52:24.873 --> 52:26.709
And I know the difference
between real feelings

52:26.741 --> 52:28.777
and a band aid, it's temporary.

52:28.810 --> 52:32.381
Exciting, maybe, but
temporary nonetheless.

52:33.948 --> 52:35.851
And I can't speak for him,
because...

52:37.620 --> 52:40.089
Look, he wrote what he wrote
and those words were his.

52:41.424 --> 52:42.092
But mine?

52:43.759 --> 52:46.396
Those letters were never about
Paul.

52:46.428 --> 52:47.730
It's why I never sent them.

52:48.730 --> 52:51.868
They were about me, you, us, it.

52:54.002 --> 52:56.138
They may have had his
name on them but they,

52:58.006 --> 52:59.142
they were all about us.

53:06.448 --> 53:08.483
Well it felt like a betrayal.

53:08.517 --> 53:10.152
An unexpected betrayal.

53:10.185 --> 53:11.653
I know that raw feeling.

53:12.988 --> 53:13.955
How was she?

53:13.989 --> 53:16.126
Everything you wanted, imagined?

53:19.661 --> 53:20.529
Okay.

53:22.730 --> 53:25.401
Pulling from my own previous
experiences,

53:26.902 --> 53:31.507
the first time with someone
new is always strange.

53:31.540 --> 53:33.009
You know, everything's
different.

53:33.042 --> 53:37.980
Her body, her smell,
her touch, her tastes.

53:38.013 --> 53:39.783
How she wakes, sleeps.

53:40.716 --> 53:41.884
Her choice of lingerie.

53:44.752 --> 53:46.021
That comfort you mentioned?

53:47.223 --> 53:49.558
It can never be there that
early, ever.

53:51.026 --> 53:52.094
You can't get to that moment

53:52.127 --> 53:55.064
where you share the silence
as you brush your teeth.

53:55.096 --> 53:57.065
You know, that moment where
you both stop brushing

53:57.098 --> 53:58.667
just to stare at one another.

53:59.902 --> 54:03.006
An impeccable smile when you
both realize it's worth more.

54:04.239 --> 54:05.540
It's unobtainable to reach there

54:05.573 --> 54:07.576
unless you heal, fully heal.

54:09.978 --> 54:10.913
I'm not there yet.

54:11.881 --> 54:12.949
I can't be there yet,

54:12.982 --> 54:16.453
and the funny thing is I
don't want to be there yet.

54:18.053 --> 54:19.589
Is it everything I imagined?

54:21.823 --> 54:22.959
Nothing happened.

54:31.200 --> 54:34.169
I never thought we wouldn't
make it.

54:34.203 --> 54:35.071
Does anyone?

54:36.939 --> 54:38.841
I was shocked, frozen.

54:43.279 --> 54:44.714
I never thought that I would
hear you say

54:44.747 --> 54:45.815
that you were done.

54:50.886 --> 54:52.688
I wanted to reach you
before that point but

54:52.721 --> 54:54.524
I guess by then it was too late.

54:54.556 --> 54:56.859
I was so fucking angry, Cee.

54:56.892 --> 54:57.759
I'm still angry.

54:58.794 --> 55:00.129
Because we failed.

55:00.161 --> 55:01.029
We.

55:02.230 --> 55:03.765
Shame on us, right?

55:07.268 --> 55:10.239
You always said that you
never wanted to divorce.

55:11.272 --> 55:12.274
You made me promise,

55:12.308 --> 55:16.246
promise our marriage
before you even proposed.

55:21.250 --> 55:24.786
I don't know where that came
from, my feelings on that.

55:24.819 --> 55:26.855
God knows it wasn't in the
family.

55:26.888 --> 55:28.524
We did better than most.

55:29.526 --> 55:31.727
Divorcing after 30
years is a bigger failure

55:31.759 --> 55:33.028
than lasting four.

55:35.064 --> 55:37.700
No, my parents were not my
inspiration.

55:39.301 --> 55:41.203
I always believed, I mean, truly
believed

55:41.236 --> 55:43.306
that when I got married, it was
for life.

55:45.140 --> 55:47.743
I didn't wanna commit to
something through habit,

55:47.776 --> 55:48.978
I mean it had to be real.

55:51.180 --> 55:52.915
The thought of divorce made me
walk

55:52.948 --> 55:54.716
a couple of times before I met
you.

55:56.352 --> 55:57.152
Then of course there was you,

55:57.185 --> 56:00.756
I mean you had it, you had a
thing.

56:02.123 --> 56:03.058
You had me.

56:04.993 --> 56:06.194
What did I know?

56:08.230 --> 56:09.098
We settled in.

56:10.232 --> 56:11.834
Eventually, yeah.

56:11.866 --> 56:14.769
Yeah I like to think it
took a few years but yeah.

56:14.803 --> 56:16.005
We did.

56:16.038 --> 56:17.707
That's why it hit like a
sledgehammer.

56:17.739 --> 56:20.308
When you backed away, I felt
this instant disconnect,

56:20.341 --> 56:21.944
just a destructive disconnect.

56:22.844 --> 56:23.712
I know.

56:25.881 --> 56:27.248
All I wanted was to spend time
with you

56:27.281 --> 56:28.182
and do things with you.

56:28.216 --> 56:29.985
Every time I would get my
feelings hurt

56:30.018 --> 56:31.353
and I start to feel rejected.

56:33.888 --> 56:35.825
It can't be a love story
without it.

56:50.439 --> 56:53.408
You never held my feelings
with any real worth.

56:53.442 --> 56:55.378
Anytime I would show you that I
was hurt

56:55.410 --> 56:56.945
you'd just push them to the
side.

56:56.978 --> 57:02.084
I really, really resented that.

57:02.116 --> 57:03.752
That was the problem.

57:03.785 --> 57:05.687
You never showed me
anything other than anger.

57:05.721 --> 57:09.025
I mean, I'd only find out about
the hurt

57:09.058 --> 57:10.860
once you came out of the mist.

57:10.893 --> 57:12.661
If you knew that I was hurt,

57:12.694 --> 57:14.963
why couldn't you show some
compassion?

57:14.997 --> 57:15.864
Pfff.

57:16.998 --> 57:18.834
That's a tough thing to ask,
Claudia,

57:18.866 --> 57:21.169
when you live under a veil of
rage.

57:22.071 --> 57:24.140
Look, when you fired a shot,

57:24.172 --> 57:25.674
my defenses, they shot back.

57:25.707 --> 57:27.108
Now that's my shit.

57:27.142 --> 57:28.710
I know that, I own that,

57:28.743 --> 57:30.912
I take my responsibility in
that.

57:30.946 --> 57:31.881
And I didn't?

57:31.913 --> 57:33.149
Not usually, no.

57:33.181 --> 57:34.283
Usually you would find a way

57:34.315 --> 57:35.451
of making me hear your point

57:35.484 --> 57:37.186
and you didn't let it go

57:37.218 --> 57:38.421
until you thought that I got it.

57:38.453 --> 57:41.056
But the truth was, I always got
it.

57:41.089 --> 57:43.325
But only after your destructive
actions.

57:43.357 --> 57:44.993
You always got it?

57:45.027 --> 57:46.129
Once explained, yeah.

57:47.495 --> 57:48.329
Then why couldn't you get it

57:48.364 --> 57:51.067
before it reached the
destructiveness?

57:51.100 --> 57:52.268
Because I wasn't a mind
reader.

57:52.301 --> 57:54.270
Yeah but you weren't blind,
either.

57:54.303 --> 57:55.237
If my feelings were hurt,

57:55.270 --> 57:57.073
you knew that pushing them aside

57:57.105 --> 58:00.308
or saying that they weren't
justified

58:00.341 --> 58:02.143
just aggravated the situation.

58:02.176 --> 58:04.913
Instead of easing them, you made
me...

58:04.946 --> 58:06.781
You judged me for having them.

58:06.814 --> 58:07.715
No.

58:07.750 --> 58:09.251
I judged you for
exploding, big difference.

58:09.283 --> 58:11.052
And that hurt you?

58:11.085 --> 58:12.087
Absolutely.

58:12.120 --> 58:13.488
And would you then explode?

58:13.522 --> 58:14.355
Sure.

58:14.388 --> 58:15.056
Right.

58:15.089 --> 58:16.424
So you would hurt my feelings

58:16.457 --> 58:18.960
and I would react, which would
cause you

58:18.993 --> 58:19.928
to have the same reaction.

58:19.962 --> 58:22.098
You do the same thing,
we're both to blame.

58:22.131 --> 58:24.200
My reaction only ignited when
yours did.

58:24.232 --> 58:26.835
And mine only ignited
when you ignored my pain.

58:26.868 --> 58:28.437
Oh, good god.

58:28.469 --> 58:30.071
All you ever had to do

58:30.105 --> 58:31.340
was say that you were hurt.

58:31.372 --> 58:33.308
I would have comforted
you every single time.

58:33.341 --> 58:36.344
But you hated ever showing
vulnerability.

58:36.377 --> 58:38.780
You saw that as a weakness
and that was the problem.

58:38.814 --> 58:40.348
And you know what, sometimes,

58:40.381 --> 58:43.818
sometimes it's okay to keep
your feelings to yourself.

58:43.852 --> 58:45.221
That saves us both.

58:45.254 --> 58:47.323
That way you can ignore the
vulnerability

58:47.355 --> 58:49.058
and I don't have to take
the swings you throw.

58:49.091 --> 58:50.460
What does that even mean?

58:51.194 --> 58:54.096
There's nothing wrong with
having feelings

58:54.129 --> 58:54.997
and expressing them.

58:55.029 --> 58:57.298
Yes, yes there is, there
totally is.

58:57.332 --> 58:59.201
You know what, sometimes it's
okay

58:59.234 --> 59:01.804
not to voice every little
fucking emotion,

59:01.837 --> 59:03.139
that's the cause of today's
drama.

59:03.172 --> 59:05.507
So I should just keep it all
in,

59:05.540 --> 59:06.776
bottle it all up?

59:06.808 --> 59:07.642
I do.

59:07.676 --> 59:09.178
I know, and look where that
got us.

59:10.212 --> 59:12.982
I don't feel the need to
tell you every little thing,

59:13.015 --> 59:14.116
I just don't.

59:14.149 --> 59:16.352
You know, sometimes it's okay to
sit

59:16.384 --> 59:18.453
with your own damn feelings
and not give them the power

59:18.486 --> 59:19.454
by being spoken.

59:19.488 --> 59:22.223
Sometimes you drive me
to the point of insanity

59:22.256 --> 59:25.059
and I feel like punching you in
the face!

59:25.093 --> 59:27.196
But I don't feel the
need to tell you that.

59:27.228 --> 59:28.797
I don't, because it's not true.

59:28.830 --> 59:31.366
Not every feeling has a
fiber of truth within it.

59:31.399 --> 59:33.001
I'm sorry, but they don't.

59:33.035 --> 59:35.270
Sometimes it's okay to feel
something

59:35.303 --> 59:36.471
and to keep it to your fucking
self.

59:36.504 --> 59:39.040
Yeah, what do you do with
your psychotic anger issues?

59:39.073 --> 59:39.907
I deal with them.

59:39.942 --> 59:41.243
How, by punching a hole in the
wall?

59:41.276 --> 59:42.111
Hah.

59:42.143 --> 59:43.279
You know what, fun fact,

59:43.312 --> 59:45.346
every man in the world has
put his fist through a wall.

59:45.379 --> 59:47.048
It's better than putting it
close to you.

59:47.082 --> 59:48.417
So chivalry is not dead.

59:48.450 --> 59:49.118
You know what I mean.

59:49.151 --> 59:50.252
No, I'm not sure that I do.

59:50.285 --> 59:53.422
I like to think that if I
feel something, anything,

59:53.455 --> 59:55.891
I can share that with the
person that I'm married to.

59:55.924 --> 59:58.326
Yeah, except when you
feel like writing letters.

01:00:07.402 --> 01:00:08.271
Cheap shot?

01:00:10.538 --> 01:00:11.406
No.

01:00:15.544 --> 01:00:20.549
It just makes
me sad, that's all.

01:00:21.515 --> 01:00:22.450
That you wrote them,

01:00:22.484 --> 01:00:24.286
or that I found them?

01:00:28.623 --> 01:00:31.359
A little bit of both, I guess.

01:00:32.627 --> 01:00:34.564
Look, can we just stop?

01:00:37.299 --> 01:00:38.434
I do not feel great

01:00:38.466 --> 01:00:42.904
and I'd really like to feel
nice at some point today.

01:03:53.661 --> 01:03:56.665
Hey, feel like joining
me for a drink, Annie?

01:04:00.468 --> 01:04:01.336
I don't drink.

01:04:03.404 --> 01:04:05.473
Well, pretend you do and join
me anyway?

01:04:10.212 --> 01:04:12.514
How much longer are
you gonna be in town?

01:04:12.547 --> 01:04:14.315
I'm leaving tomorrow.

01:04:14.348 --> 01:04:17.085
Head north for the day
before we come back through.

01:04:18.319 --> 01:04:19.354
Why you are here?

01:04:21.223 --> 01:04:22.391
It's family business.

01:04:26.761 --> 01:04:28.096
Of course, sorry.

01:04:28.129 --> 01:04:29.531
No, no, no.

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.469
Is everything okay?

01:04:34.502 --> 01:04:35.736
Yeah.

01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:37.172
Yeah, I think so.

01:04:40.174 --> 01:04:41.310
You sure I can't tempt you?

01:04:41.343 --> 01:04:43.411
- Just a-
- I can't.

01:04:43.444 --> 01:04:44.846
Not here.

01:04:44.879 --> 01:04:46.481
No, my rules, not theirs.

01:04:47.848 --> 01:04:48.716
I understand.

01:04:50.718 --> 01:04:53.488
But I know a coffee
place not far from here.

01:04:53.522 --> 01:04:54.756
It's actually close to my house
too.

01:04:54.788 --> 01:04:59.127
I don't know if you want.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:04:59.894
Or tea?

01:04:59.928 --> 01:05:00.761
Or tea.

01:05:00.794 --> 01:05:01.863
You do tea?

01:05:01.897 --> 01:05:02.765
Both?

01:05:03.665 --> 01:05:06.401
You know what, that
would be great, Annie.

01:05:06.433 --> 01:05:09.437
That would be beautiful, really
great.

01:05:12.707 --> 01:05:14.343
I like you remember my name.

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:18.714
I'd be crazy not to.

01:05:25.687 --> 01:05:26.555
Grazie.

01:05:27.522 --> 01:05:28.757
So you're the one, huh?

01:05:30.225 --> 01:05:32.328
Yes, born and raised.

01:05:33.627 --> 01:05:36.531
I mean most people leave
to larger cities but

01:05:37.399 --> 01:05:38.299
I missed it here.

01:05:39.801 --> 01:05:40.669
This is home.

01:05:42.203 --> 01:05:42.872
I'm happy here.

01:05:43.971 --> 01:05:46.542
You like it at the
hotel?

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:47.509
Mhmm, ci.

01:05:50.477 --> 01:05:53.214
Well, I like to see new faces
every day.

01:05:55.283 --> 01:05:56.418
Say hello, goodbye.

01:05:58.652 --> 01:05:59.522
Well.

01:06:00.689 --> 01:06:02.924
I mean it's fleeting but it's
real.

01:06:07.562 --> 01:06:09.732
Actually, it's rare to
see someone like you.

01:06:10.765 --> 01:06:11.933
Like me, what do you mean?

01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:18.507
I meant someone who is
not on his nature hike?

01:06:21.276 --> 01:06:24.547
Or one of those, what's
the name in English,

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.917
how do you call the
things that you walk with?

01:06:30.785 --> 01:06:32.421
The motorbike, skillet?

01:06:32.453 --> 01:06:33.287
No.

01:06:33.321 --> 01:06:34.523
The horse.

01:06:34.556 --> 01:06:35.591
How do you call it in English?

01:06:35.623 --> 01:06:38.893
You know the one that you
use like the canes, or,

01:06:40.962 --> 01:06:41.830
- Canes?
- Cane?

01:06:43.497 --> 01:06:44.399
- What?
- A walker?

01:06:45.134 --> 01:06:47.803
The walker, with the
tennis balls on the bottom?

01:06:47.835 --> 01:06:48.904
That's what you mean?

01:06:48.937 --> 01:06:49.571
Yeah.

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:50.639
For the older generation.

01:06:50.672 --> 01:06:51.506
Yes.

01:06:54.408 --> 01:06:56.911
So what, you're saying
that only bearded hikers

01:06:56.944 --> 01:06:58.713
and old people visit the
village?

01:07:01.482 --> 01:07:02.350
Yes.

01:07:03.518 --> 01:07:05.721
That's cute, but that's not
true.

01:07:05.754 --> 01:07:06.955
Why not?

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:11.360
Well, 10 years ago, I came
through here on my honeymoon.

01:07:11.393 --> 01:07:13.929
We were both young and freshly
shaved,

01:07:13.962 --> 01:07:15.497
not a hiking boot in sight.

01:07:17.431 --> 01:07:18.600
Okay, good point.

01:07:18.632 --> 01:07:20.502
So maybe it's just my experience
then.

01:07:20.535 --> 01:07:21.370
Perhaps.

01:07:21.402 --> 01:07:22.370
- Perhaps.
- Yeah.

01:07:22.404 --> 01:07:24.739
I just have to open my
mind a little bit more.

01:07:27.975 --> 01:07:30.245
So tell me, this place here.

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:34.915
Is this the highlight of the
local fare?

01:07:34.948 --> 01:07:38.352
I mean the beautiful lady over
there

01:07:38.386 --> 01:07:41.623
looks like she could still
take me in an arm wrestle.

01:07:41.656 --> 01:07:44.593
I mean is this where it all goes
down?

01:07:46.828 --> 01:07:47.863
No.

01:07:47.895 --> 01:07:49.464
This is just a place.

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:53.035
And then it's up to the
individual to be creative.

01:07:54.636 --> 01:07:56.538
But there's so much stuff to do
here.

01:07:57.471 --> 01:07:58.339
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:04.578
You know there's a pool at the
hotel.

01:08:04.611 --> 01:08:05.613
No one ever uses it.

01:08:06.413 --> 01:08:08.984
Well at night, no, it's too
cold.

01:08:09.017 --> 01:08:10.986
But also during the day.

01:08:11.018 --> 01:08:11.886
Too old.

01:08:16.523 --> 01:08:17.660
Wanna go swim with me?

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:21.763
Now?

01:08:21.795 --> 01:08:23.631
Right now, yeah.

01:08:23.665 --> 01:08:25.734
I mean we can't do it when
any of the staff are around.

01:08:25.767 --> 01:08:27.068
Your rules, I'm just...

01:08:29.737 --> 01:08:31.372
Well.

01:08:31.406 --> 01:08:34.975
Thank you so much for your
cavalier attitude, but,

01:08:35.009 --> 01:08:38.046
no, Ryan, I'm not going
swimming with you now.

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:40.048
Why not?

01:08:41.648 --> 01:08:42.983
Well.

01:08:43.017 --> 01:08:45.354
I don't have my swimming
suit, first of all.

01:08:46.086 --> 01:08:47.988
Yeah, we'll improvise.

01:08:48.022 --> 01:08:49.457
It's too cold.

01:08:50.524 --> 01:08:51.794
You'll adjust in no time.

01:08:54.528 --> 01:08:55.430
You're crazy.

01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:58.901
A little bit, yeah.

01:08:59.901 --> 01:09:00.769
It's too far.

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:09.411
I don't know of one closer,
so.

01:09:11.045 --> 01:09:11.912
I do.

01:09:17.618 --> 01:09:18.487
This way.

01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:23.959
I hope you know the
owners.

01:09:23.992 --> 01:09:25.527
What happened to cavalier?

01:09:26.227 --> 01:09:28.063
I thought about the risk of
trespassing.

01:09:30.898 --> 01:09:32.968
The risk of apathy far
outweighs that.

01:09:34.602 --> 01:09:35.470
That's true.

01:09:50.652 --> 01:09:51.687
No peeking.

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.790
No touching, just swimming.

01:09:54.822 --> 01:09:55.690
Deal?

01:09:57.192 --> 01:09:58.060
Deal.

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:03.098
And no peeing.

01:10:05.632 --> 01:10:07.702
I can't guarantee that.

01:11:00.854 --> 01:11:02.123
We're waiting.

01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:04.593
We?

01:11:06.961 --> 01:11:09.531
Me, the sky,

01:11:10.797 --> 01:11:11.733
the universe.

01:11:13.201 --> 01:11:14.069
We.

01:11:17.639 --> 01:11:19.808
So you're gonna give
me the same courtesy?

01:11:21.108 --> 01:11:22.643
Absolutely not.

01:11:40.894 --> 01:11:41.897
Oh.

01:11:42.996 --> 01:11:43.864
It's cold.

01:11:43.898 --> 01:11:45.767
Mhmm, it's freezing.

01:11:52.806 --> 01:11:54.209
Tell me about her.

01:11:57.612 --> 01:11:58.279
Why?

01:12:01.582 --> 01:12:02.783
Just because.

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:09.257
I don't think I can.

01:12:11.059 --> 01:12:12.661
Why not?

01:12:23.337 --> 01:12:24.805
I'm not ready.

01:12:25.872 --> 01:12:27.841
It will get better.

01:12:27.875 --> 01:12:29.144
I know.

01:12:33.947 --> 01:12:35.349
It will get better.

01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:41.790
Why not?

01:13:32.407 --> 01:13:33.775
Hey, it's me.

01:13:37.111 --> 01:13:38.345
It's good.

01:13:38.379 --> 01:13:39.348
Yeah, yeah, good.

01:13:44.919 --> 01:13:45.787
A little.

01:13:46.987 --> 01:13:48.022
It's tough, you know?

01:13:51.059 --> 01:13:52.160
Yeah, kind of.

01:13:57.297 --> 01:13:59.800
And they make me feel weird
sometimes.

01:14:02.403 --> 01:14:03.905
They give me strange dreams.

01:14:06.073 --> 01:14:06.907
Maybe, I don't know,

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:11.880
it's given me time, I guess, to
think.

01:14:14.014 --> 01:14:15.149
About everything.

01:14:17.218 --> 01:14:18.286
Well, like everything.

01:14:20.455 --> 01:14:22.256
My marriage, my childhood.

01:14:23.724 --> 01:14:24.759
You, dad.

01:14:26.094 --> 01:14:27.395
Life, my life.

01:14:28.962 --> 01:14:31.065
It's just that I'm starting to
see this,

01:14:31.099 --> 01:14:34.403
this common need for me
to make sense of it all.

01:14:35.303 --> 01:14:36.738
And that need is becoming

01:14:38.272 --> 01:14:39.774
more and more obvious.

01:14:44.178 --> 01:14:45.046
Letting go.

01:14:46.179 --> 01:14:49.316
The fear, anger, the pain.

01:14:49.349 --> 01:14:52.453
It also means letting go
of all the good stuff too.

01:14:52.487 --> 01:14:56.391
You know, just, letting it come
and pass.

01:14:58.859 --> 01:15:00.461
I don't know, just feel the
emotion

01:15:02.529 --> 01:15:04.232
of it all and just

01:15:05.099 --> 01:15:05.967
let it be.

01:15:11.205 --> 01:15:14.375
It feels easy actually.

01:15:14.407 --> 01:15:16.844
As long as I'm paying
attention it feels easy.

01:15:21.948 --> 01:15:24.219
It's about forgiveness, Mom.

01:15:25.419 --> 01:15:27.488
We'll have to forgive, right?

01:15:27.522 --> 01:15:29.825
I guess that's what I'm trying
to say.

01:15:33.059 --> 01:15:33.961
I forgive you.

01:15:36.797 --> 01:15:37.866
For anything.

01:15:38.565 --> 01:15:40.135
For everything, I don't know.

01:15:41.269 --> 01:15:44.873
Anything you've ever felt
guilty about as a mother.

01:15:48.009 --> 01:15:49.277
Well, it doesn't matter.

01:15:54.215 --> 01:15:57.418
I'm not trying to make
you feel bad, mom, okay?

01:15:57.451 --> 01:15:59.386
Every kid is shaped in some way

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:01.890
by something that happened
in their earlier life.

01:16:01.922 --> 01:16:04.459
I'm just letting you know

01:16:04.492 --> 01:16:07.195
and freeing myself in
the process, that's all.

01:16:09.095 --> 01:16:10.297
Yeah but, do you hear me?

01:16:12.433 --> 01:16:14.102
I love you and I forgive you.

01:16:22.609 --> 01:16:24.411
I'm sorry about that.

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.849
Maybe you can forgive me too.

01:16:31.452 --> 01:16:34.456
Mom, hey, it's not about
punishment.

01:16:36.389 --> 01:16:37.258
No.

01:16:39.292 --> 01:16:41.295
It's all about love, actually.

01:16:52.273 --> 01:16:53.141
Not yet, no.

01:16:56.210 --> 01:16:57.846
Today.

01:16:57.879 --> 01:16:58.546
Uh-huh.

01:17:00.915 --> 01:17:04.385
Yeah, I will.

01:17:04.417 --> 01:17:05.353
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:06.953 --> 01:17:08.156
I love you too.

01:17:09.489 --> 01:17:10.892
All right, bye.

01:17:25.005 --> 01:17:25.873
Hey.

01:17:25.907 --> 01:17:26.575
Hey.

01:17:27.942 --> 01:17:28.609
You okay?

01:17:30.176 --> 01:17:31.513
Yeah, you know.

01:17:33.648 --> 01:17:35.483
Where've you been?

01:17:35.515 --> 01:17:37.251
I took a long walk

01:17:38.452 --> 01:17:40.388
somewhere beyond the olive
groves.

01:17:41.621 --> 01:17:43.257
What happened to your face?

01:17:48.461 --> 01:17:52.334
I think I'm gonna try
to come off the pills.

01:17:53.233 --> 01:17:54.102
It's time.

01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:03.979
Only you can tell.

01:18:06.447 --> 01:18:08.483
I think I gotta take it as it
comes.

01:18:10.417 --> 01:18:12.152
Face it head-on, you know?

01:18:12.853 --> 01:18:16.056
It's a lot to deal with
head-on.

01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:20.962
Are you gonna discuss it with
your doctor?

01:18:23.464 --> 01:18:25.198
He'll continue pushing
pills down my throat

01:18:25.232 --> 01:18:26.533
for as long as I'm insured.

01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:32.072
I just don't wanna live
in the fog anymore.

01:18:34.675 --> 01:18:37.145
The other way might
not be that much clearer.

01:18:38.479 --> 01:18:40.015
At least I'll know it's real.

01:18:41.715 --> 01:18:43.617
Medicated, I walk a thin line.

01:18:46.354 --> 01:18:49.224
I'll support you, you know
that.

01:18:55.429 --> 01:18:56.965
I'm just tired.

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:00.669
Tired of being sad.

01:19:13.113 --> 01:19:13.982
Okay.

01:19:15.049 --> 01:19:16.151
So what say you, hmm?

01:19:19.553 --> 01:19:20.453
Ready to take our last trip

01:19:20.487 --> 01:19:22.656
down our lane of memories, hit
the road?

01:19:26.059 --> 01:19:26.727
Yeah.

01:19:29.229 --> 01:19:30.598
I can be ready in about five.

01:19:32.265 --> 01:19:33.734
Might take me a little longer.

01:19:35.368 --> 01:19:36.336
Overpacked?

01:19:36.370 --> 01:19:37.238
Yeah.

01:19:38.138 --> 01:19:41.509
Why I feel the need to
pack more than two jackets

01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:45.012
is a mystery, a slightly
embarrassing mystery.

01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:48.482
It's easy to love perfect.

01:19:51.652 --> 01:19:53.755
It's the little annoyances that
take time.

01:20:03.730 --> 01:20:05.198
Hey.

01:20:07.367 --> 01:20:08.236
Yeah?

01:20:11.604 --> 01:20:12.473
I love you.

01:20:26.487 --> 01:20:27.355
You ready?

01:20:36.831 --> 01:20:37.799
Yeah, I think so.

01:21:29.183 --> 01:21:30.551
For our anniversary last year,

01:21:30.584 --> 01:21:32.252
this trip was always on my mind.

01:21:34.188 --> 01:21:37.358
To walk back in the footsteps of
two kids

01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:38.326
who fell in love

01:21:39.425 --> 01:21:40.727
and decided to take in the
majesty

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:42.696
of a country we both felt
connected to.

01:21:46.834 --> 01:21:50.572
10 years ago, I married
the woman of my dreams.

01:21:52.907 --> 01:21:55.110
And I promised to love her,
protect her.

01:21:55.943 --> 01:21:57.445
To live and to die with her.

01:22:00.313 --> 01:22:02.749
Now we chose to come
to this village because

01:22:02.782 --> 01:22:06.153
we heard this is where your
grandma married grandpa, right?

01:22:06.187 --> 01:22:09.422
And for years you were told
that there were no records,

01:22:09.456 --> 01:22:12.226
no proof, no definite guarantee

01:22:12.259 --> 01:22:14.529
that this is where they shared
their vows.

01:22:14.562 --> 01:22:15.697
Now, as a 25 year old,

01:22:16.397 --> 01:22:18.498
my sources relied on
stories from your folks

01:22:18.532 --> 01:22:20.501
and I didn't think of digging
much deeper,

01:22:20.533 --> 01:22:21.902
so we decided not to go.

01:22:23.604 --> 01:22:24.472
10 years on,

01:22:26.372 --> 01:22:27.642
I thought it would be a shame
not to.

01:22:29.609 --> 01:22:30.478
So.

01:22:32.313 --> 01:22:33.748
Wanna see where they said I do?

01:22:35.582 --> 01:22:36.951
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:22:36.983 --> 01:22:38.451
Yes.

01:23:24.364 --> 01:23:25.366
Wait here.

01:23:37.711 --> 01:23:38.580
Psst.

01:24:01.035 --> 01:24:03.371
You're out of your mind.

01:24:05.406 --> 01:24:08.343
We both know that to be the
case.

01:24:34.033 --> 01:24:35.569
It's beautiful.

01:24:39.605 --> 01:24:40.474
Thank you.

01:24:53.886 --> 01:24:55.889
But it's too late, baby.

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:00.828
All of it.

01:25:09.502 --> 01:25:10.772
You're too late.

01:25:13.005 --> 01:25:18.011
I'm so sorry.

01:27:05.685 --> 01:27:07.421
This is it.

01:27:09.223 --> 01:27:10.491
This is it.

01:27:32.278 --> 01:27:36.049
So many memories.

01:27:42.523 --> 01:27:44.926
This was one of the happiest
moments of our lives.

01:27:57.770 --> 01:27:59.840
We have to talk about it, right?

01:28:05.912 --> 01:28:07.514
I don't want to.

01:28:08.782 --> 01:28:10.251
I know.

01:28:12.251 --> 01:28:13.653
But we have to.

01:28:24.931 --> 01:28:26.567
I just miss you so much, Cee.

01:28:45.952 --> 01:28:47.120
You died on a Saturday.

01:29:01.801 --> 01:29:05.139
They gave us enough time to
process, but,

01:29:06.273 --> 01:29:08.576
I didn't believe them.

01:29:08.608 --> 01:29:09.276
I couldn't.

01:29:12.345 --> 01:29:13.747
Out of nothing.

01:29:16.215 --> 01:29:17.617
Out of nowhere.

01:29:25.759 --> 01:29:27.962
I held on to you every day.

01:29:32.032 --> 01:29:35.236
And I pushed through my guilt,
my pain,

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:40.708
my hate,

01:29:43.710 --> 01:29:44.845
my resentment.

01:29:51.084 --> 01:29:52.019
You were my everything, kid,

01:29:52.051 --> 01:29:55.922
and I don't know how
to do this without you.

01:30:13.706 --> 01:30:15.776
We've come this far, huh?

01:30:19.379 --> 01:30:21.881
I have to say goodbye
and it breaks my heart.

01:30:45.237 --> 01:30:46.106
Hey.

01:31:59.179 --> 01:32:00.080
In your will,

01:32:00.113 --> 01:32:01.748
you requested to have your ashes
scattered

01:32:01.782 --> 01:32:04.218
in the one place you call
paradise.

01:32:04.251 --> 01:32:06.220
The trip was what I needed.

01:32:06.252 --> 01:32:08.889
It gave me strength, time.

01:32:11.190 --> 01:32:13.393
Know that I can never fully
heal.

01:32:13.425 --> 01:32:15.028
The truth is, I don't want to.

01:32:16.095 --> 01:32:17.997
I always want to feel
like something is missing

01:32:18.031 --> 01:32:18.899
because it is.

01:32:20.099 --> 01:32:21.201
And all I can promise

01:32:21.902 --> 01:32:24.171
is that every time your face
appears,

01:32:24.203 --> 01:32:25.339
I won't feel sorrow.

01:32:26.305 --> 01:32:29.175
I will smile as big as I can.

01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:32.779
For you were the greatest
teacher,

01:32:32.813 --> 01:32:33.480
friend,

01:32:34.447 --> 01:32:36.150
foe,

01:32:36.183 --> 01:32:37.051
lover.

01:32:39.385 --> 01:32:40.254
Wife.

01:32:46.593 --> 01:32:47.461
And now,

01:32:59.339 --> 01:33:00.207
I let go.
