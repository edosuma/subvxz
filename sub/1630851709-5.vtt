<i>Tonight, on Bachelor in
Paradise Canada.</i>

00:14.881 --> 00:18.518
There is this rose ceremony on
the horizon and,

00:18.585 --> 00:21.321
I'm like very confused.

00:21.388 --> 00:23.957
Men are all about respect
coming into Paradise.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.826
I had a blast. I wanted to
explore that more.

00:26.893 --> 00:29.729
And I feel like pulling Illeana
was a big mistake for him.

00:29.796 --> 00:32.432
No disrespect, bro.
I don't give a

00:32.499 --> 00:34.734
Bro, what are you doing?!

00:34.801 --> 00:39.339
To finding yourself and
finding love.

00:39.406 --> 00:42.976
Everybody's like...
banking on me.

00:43.042 --> 00:44.844
If you give me
the rose tonight,

00:44.911 --> 00:47.380
I will have your back
the next time.

00:47.447 --> 00:50.016
I am absolutely so
torn right now.

00:50.083 --> 00:53.019
Everyone's watching the
show. Where's the popcorn?

00:53.086 --> 00:54.421
It's fine.

00:54.487 --> 00:56.723
It's real, bro, it's not
watching a show.

00:58.625 --> 01:00.493
Kamil is just on a
downward spiral

01:00.560 --> 01:02.328
on his way out
of Paradise.

01:02.395 --> 01:03.897
You're a rooster,
I'm a gorilla, like,

01:03.963 --> 01:05.365
sit your ass down.

01:05.432 --> 01:06.699
I'm just gonna be
straight up with you.

01:06.766 --> 01:08.668
I want to take you on a date.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.337
I'm here to get in
people's lanes.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.572
I'm Mac Truck Mike.

01:12.639 --> 01:15.842
And, if you don't move over,
I'm gonna run you off the road.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.912
Are we all getting played?
Like, who's safe?

01:18.978 --> 01:22.582
It feels, like, horrible.

01:22.649 --> 01:24.417
I just feel like
I'm not enough.

01:24.484 --> 01:25.919
My intuition was right.

01:25.985 --> 01:27.921
I'm just
so sick of this.

01:27.987 --> 01:32.125
I'm so sick of it. Why
don't I get my happiness?

02:57.076 --> 03:00.847

I don't feel like it's
always gonna be

03:02.248 --> 03:05.485
this quiet here
in Paradise.

03:05.552 --> 03:06.853
Hey, how are you?

03:06.920 --> 03:10.990
Ugh... I'm okay.

03:11.057 --> 03:13.526
With Adam and Illeana
on that date,

03:13.593 --> 03:16.796
I'm just being the lone wolf
at the bar with Kevin.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.032
Cheers to an epic sunset with
the bartender, buddy.

03:19.098 --> 03:20.199
Geez, thanks, man.

03:20.266 --> 03:21.034
Thanks for being
my date tonight.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.569
- You got it.
- I appreciate that.

03:22.635 --> 03:24.003
I'm hurting a little bit
and I'm sad.

03:24.070 --> 03:26.239
I don't know,
it's a weird scenario.

03:26.306 --> 03:28.608
I get sometimes mistaken
for being weak

03:28.675 --> 03:30.143
'cause I'm open and stuff.
But like, don't take me

03:30.210 --> 03:31.811
for granted 'cause I
could be that guy

03:31.878 --> 03:33.880
that says, "I won't give
you a chance again.

03:33.947 --> 03:34.747
See you later."

03:34.814 --> 03:35.548
Like, even though it's
okay she went,

03:35.615 --> 03:37.550
aren't you curious
why she went?

03:37.617 --> 03:39.185
'Cause she'd be having
sunset with you right now.

03:39.252 --> 03:41.721
Like, majority of people here
are coupled up and,

03:41.788 --> 03:42.789
that could've
been us tonight.

03:42.855 --> 03:44.524
Yeah, so, I think you have
the right to ask why.

03:44.591 --> 03:45.959
Yeah, for sure.

03:46.025 --> 03:48.595
I just hope Illeana is thinking
about me on that date.

03:53.833 --> 03:54.968
Look at this.

03:55.034 --> 03:57.236
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my God.

03:57.303 --> 03:59.906
I'm not here to compete
with other people.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.008
I know what I have
to offer and,

04:02.075 --> 04:05.578
I am definitely ready to show
what I got to Illeana.

04:05.645 --> 04:07.547
What's your
favourite holiday?

04:07.614 --> 04:10.650
Favourite holiday,
ooh.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.285
Getting real deep here.

04:12.352 --> 04:15.254
Adam and I, we had that like
serious conversation

04:15.321 --> 04:17.790
last night, but I wanted
to see if he can be

04:17.857 --> 04:19.959
like the fun,
playful guy too.

04:20.026 --> 04:21.894
Do you celebrate your
birthday every year?

04:21.961 --> 04:25.665
Ah... yeah, sometimes,
I don't know.

04:25.732 --> 04:28.868
But, Adam wasn't giving me
a lot to work with.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.871
What's like one of your
favourite experiences that

04:31.938 --> 04:34.907
you've had thus far,
in life? Like something-

04:34.974 --> 04:35.908
In life?

04:35.975 --> 04:38.978
Yeah, something that just
stands out to you.

04:39.045 --> 04:43.016
Something that
stands out to me...

04:43.082 --> 04:45.018
We're sitting
under the stars.

04:45.084 --> 04:47.887
It should be a really
romantic setting,

04:47.954 --> 04:50.256
but it does feel a bit forced.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.625
- Do you like heights?
- Ah...

04:52.692 --> 04:55.862
I, I don't like them.
But I'm not,

04:55.928 --> 04:58.298
I don't have a fear of them,
necessarily.

04:58.364 --> 05:01.334
Instead of talking,
we're just kissing.

05:04.904 --> 05:10.343
Which isn't bad, but it's
not getting us anywhere.

05:10.410 --> 05:11.878
I feel like I've got
like a bullseye,

05:11.944 --> 05:15.581
like a target on her.
And I'm hitting my mark.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.817
I'm know I'm really
attracted to him,

05:17.884 --> 05:22.355
but I'm like very confused.

05:22.422 --> 05:24.190
- So?
- So...

05:24.257 --> 05:27.794
-
- So?

05:27.860 --> 05:30.096
Um, yeah.

05:35.768 --> 05:37.070
...I'm okay with all
that stuff, right?

05:37.136 --> 05:38.705
- Hello.
- Hey, guys, how are ya?

05:38.771 --> 05:40.239
- How are you guys doing?
- Good, how are you?

05:40.306 --> 05:41.307
- Looking good, bro.
- Thank you, man.

05:41.374 --> 05:42.975
- I appreciate that.
- Looking sharp.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.044
- Can I speak to you?
- Yeah, of course.

05:45.111 --> 05:46.979
See you in a bit.

05:47.046 --> 05:48.348
So, tell me about the date, man.
I want to know.

05:48.414 --> 05:50.917
Dude, it was fire. It was
like, it was unbelievable.

05:52.819 --> 05:55.121
I just want to let you know,
I miss you.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.390
I'm sad deep down when
I'm not with you.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.125
But like, I'm a grown man.
Like, I can take it.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.193
It's fine.

06:00.259 --> 06:02.295
So, went on the date and,

06:02.362 --> 06:04.697
I'm super glad I
went because...

06:04.764 --> 06:06.365
him and I did have
fun yesterday.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.835
And I felt like I owed it to
him since he has

06:08.901 --> 06:10.403
limited time here.

06:10.470 --> 06:13.673
There is this rose ceremony
on the horizon and,

06:13.740 --> 06:16.242
I know that I am inevitably
going to have to

06:16.309 --> 06:17.643
make a decision.

06:17.710 --> 06:20.646
Difficult conversations
need to be had.

06:20.713 --> 06:21.681
So, the date went well.

06:21.748 --> 06:23.783
- The date went very well.
- Okay, that's good.

06:23.850 --> 06:24.584
Yeah.

06:24.684 --> 06:26.719
So, your connection
is like, dope?

06:26.786 --> 06:29.088
It's... yeah.
It's real dope.

06:29.155 --> 06:32.325
It's dope as
Dope AF, yeah.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.693
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.895
Adam is overly confident.

06:35.962 --> 06:39.365
He's got this shit-eating
grin on his face 24/7.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.167
He's a douchebag.

06:43.002 --> 06:45.171
So, I was like, I already
feel something

06:45.238 --> 06:47.073
really strongly towards you.

06:47.140 --> 06:50.209
But let me see this through
with Adam and see,

06:50.276 --> 06:53.946
can my heart...
or head go somewhere else.

06:54.013 --> 06:55.314
- So, I went.
- Yeah, of course.

06:55.381 --> 06:56.816
And it was a nice time.

06:56.883 --> 07:00.086
But, I was just
thinking about

07:00.153 --> 07:04.924
coming back and
being with you.

07:04.991 --> 07:08.895
And, I'm going to
have to tell him that

07:08.961 --> 07:10.997
my heart is somewhere else.

07:11.063 --> 07:14.700
I knew that, but I wouldn't
have known it for sure

07:14.767 --> 07:16.469
had I not gone
a second time.

07:16.536 --> 07:17.670
- Right.
- So...

07:17.737 --> 07:20.973
I thought you might like that
information, I don't know.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.341
I do, I'm happy.

07:22.408 --> 07:24.977
It's like 200 pounds
lifted off my chest.

07:25.044 --> 07:28.881
I feel like this is gonna be
better for us moving forward.

07:28.948 --> 07:32.051
And, we're gonna get
even stronger.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.187
That's all you can
ask for in Paradise.

07:34.253 --> 07:35.188
I missed you.

07:35.254 --> 07:38.791
I missed you too.

07:38.858 --> 07:40.293
Talk to us, man.
How'd it go?

07:40.359 --> 07:42.228
It was amazing, bro.
It was like...

07:42.295 --> 07:44.297
dial, yeah.
It was so good.

07:44.363 --> 07:45.731
We went ice skating, bro.

07:45.798 --> 07:46.933
- Hey.
- Yeah, hey.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.201
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

07:48.267 --> 07:49.368
- Can I chat with you?
- Yeah.

07:49.435 --> 07:50.470
You can definitely
chat with me.

07:50.536 --> 07:52.205
- Alright, boys.
- Talk to you later.

07:52.271 --> 07:54.340
- See you in a few?
- Yeah? Alright, cool.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.010
He's going home.

07:58.077 --> 08:01.113
That body language
isn't good.

08:01.180 --> 08:04.016
Yeah, she...
like, I mean.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.152
You... you guys know
how I carry myself.

08:06.219 --> 08:10.256
Look at this guy!
Look at this guy!

08:10.323 --> 08:11.991
That's the first time I've
seen this smile!

08:12.058 --> 08:14.827
I've seen all of his pearly
whites like that, bro.

08:14.894 --> 08:17.129
Like, hey, so what's up?
So, what happened?

08:17.196 --> 08:19.131
- Look at you, bro!
- Chill, chill, chill.

08:19.198 --> 08:22.802
Yo, "chill,
chill, chill, chill".

08:25.538 --> 08:27.540
I wanted you to know
that I had a blast.

08:27.607 --> 08:28.875
Yeah, it was amazing.

08:28.941 --> 08:31.043
But I have to be
honest with you.

08:31.110 --> 08:32.144
Okay.

08:32.211 --> 08:35.314
Like, I feel incredibly
grateful that you chose me.

08:35.381 --> 08:38.317
And I appreciated how
vulnerable you were with me.

08:38.384 --> 08:41.921
And so, that's why today,
I felt like today I owe it

08:41.988 --> 08:45.057
to us, as a
potential couple,

08:45.124 --> 08:46.959
to like explore that more.

08:47.026 --> 08:50.296
But I do just feel
like my heart...

08:50.363 --> 08:53.799
- Yeah?
- Is more with Brendan S.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.401
And I want you to
know that now,

08:55.468 --> 08:59.405
so you have an opportunity to
talk and meet other girls

08:59.472 --> 09:03.175
because I think you're
an incredible guy.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.845
- Ha, alright.
- Like, you're so cool.

09:05.912 --> 09:08.080
But I think my heart is
somewhere else.

09:08.147 --> 09:10.116
And it's like, I've never
done this before.

09:10.182 --> 09:13.286
- Yeah, totally.
- And I am not good at it.

09:13.352 --> 09:14.487
Mhm.

09:14.553 --> 09:16.322
I was surprised
how shook I was.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.357
It definitely rocked me
to my core.

09:18.424 --> 09:20.927
Yeah, bit of, bit of a slap in
the face, I guess.

09:20.993 --> 09:22.194
No! And it's-

09:22.261 --> 09:23.596
You know what,
you know what, I get it.

09:23.663 --> 09:28.901
But obviously, I guess your
mind's in a different...

09:28.968 --> 09:30.202
different headspace.

09:30.269 --> 09:34.407
It's not easy at all to talk
to Adam about this.

09:34.473 --> 09:37.310
I don't want to ever seem like I
took that date for granted.

09:37.376 --> 09:38.544
It sucks.

09:38.611 --> 09:40.980
Yeah, I mean, it sucks.
It really does suck.

09:41.047 --> 09:43.950
Well, I mean, I hope...

09:44.016 --> 09:48.554
Ah... yeah.

09:48.621 --> 09:52.024
Yeah, that's,
yeah. Cheers.

09:52.091 --> 09:55.161
Cheers.

09:55.227 --> 09:57.096
Well, [beep]!

10:06.973 --> 10:09.475
- Let's go together.
- Ugh. That's awkward.

10:09.542 --> 10:12.144
I mean, at least let's
do it as a team.

10:12.211 --> 10:14.447
I saw that Illeana and Adam
were speaking again

10:14.513 --> 10:16.382
after the date and then
he was alone.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.018
And, he like was spiralling.

10:19.085 --> 10:20.286
- How you doing, man?
- I'm good.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.054
- How are you guys doing?
- Alright.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.389
Just wanted to
check up on you.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.191
Yeah? I'm okay.

10:25.257 --> 10:27.960
I mean, if you have other
plans, by all means.

10:28.027 --> 10:29.328
No, there's no plans.

10:29.395 --> 10:32.064
I just had a conversation
with Illeana.

10:32.131 --> 10:35.634
She is into,
ah... Brendan.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.169
We could have told you
that from the start.

10:37.236 --> 10:38.571
Like, like don't,
like, okay.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.407
Men are all about respect
coming into Paradise,

10:41.474 --> 10:43.009
and talking about
who's with who,

10:43.075 --> 10:46.045
what girl is possibly like,
off limits.

10:46.112 --> 10:48.014
It's a sign of respect.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.417
And I feel like pulling Illeana
was a big mistake for him.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.286
No disrespect, bro.
I don't, I don't give a

10:54.353 --> 10:57.056
Like straight up don't
say that to me.

10:57.123 --> 10:58.691
'Cause like, that makes
no difference to me.

10:58.758 --> 11:00.459
- I'm just saying.
- I don't give a shit.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.595
This guy doesn't know what
he's talking about and

11:02.662 --> 11:04.430
has my blood boiling.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.166
Like, I respect whatever
the women want.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.401
If they want to see
somebody or

11:08.467 --> 11:09.935
don't want to see
somebody, that's cool.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.137
That's fantastic.

11:11.203 --> 11:15.274
Kamil made a comment about how
Adam should've come in and

11:15.341 --> 11:18.177
asked the guys where they were
at with their women.

11:18.244 --> 11:20.479
That annoyed me because...

11:20.546 --> 11:22.481
like, we have a voice too.

11:22.548 --> 11:24.116
You know, you did what
you wanted to do.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.018
You followed your heart
in the moment and

11:26.085 --> 11:29.522
it said to go for Illeana.
We're close with Brendan S.,

11:29.588 --> 11:32.558
but it would have ruffled
feathers for anyone here.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.394
I respect that you
wanted to, like,

11:35.461 --> 11:36.996
fight for it and go all in.

11:37.063 --> 11:39.265
You did what you
wanted to do.

11:39.331 --> 11:42.134
When you stay true
to what you want,

11:42.201 --> 11:45.304
how could you ever
leave with any regrets?

11:45.371 --> 11:46.639
Truly, you have to
follow your heart and

11:46.706 --> 11:47.873
just go for what you want.

11:47.940 --> 11:51.010
There could literally be a rose
ceremony coming up tomorrow.

11:51.077 --> 11:52.278
I'm not giving up.

12:04.123 --> 12:05.758
Tonight's the rose ceremony,
and that means that the

12:05.825 --> 12:08.227
girls get to decide who gets
to continue this journey.

12:08.294 --> 12:09.995
I'm honestly
really stressed.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.064
I just feel like there's so
many people going home and

12:12.131 --> 12:14.567
I'm obviously the last one
to form any connection here.

12:14.633 --> 12:17.269
Josh seems really genuine,
just the way he treats me

12:17.336 --> 12:18.270
and the things
he says to me.

12:18.337 --> 12:20.506
And like, we've obviously
kissed and stuff.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.608
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Talk about the kiss.

12:22.675 --> 12:23.676
It was the in the hot tub
and it wasn't

12:23.743 --> 12:25.244
the only thing
that was hot.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.646
Oh, okay!

12:27.713 --> 12:29.715
People have to understand,
I'm the wildcard here and

12:29.782 --> 12:31.784
people could be totally
faking feelings because

12:31.851 --> 12:34.120
they said, "Well, Lisa's
the only option.

12:34.186 --> 12:36.455
And I don't want to be
anyone's second choice,

12:36.522 --> 12:40.292
third choice,
tenth choice".

12:42.328 --> 12:45.030
So, we have the rose
ceremony coming up.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.333
Here's exactly how I see it.
If I had to guess,

12:47.399 --> 12:49.435
Lisa would be giving
you her rose.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.070
The only person
I could possibly

12:51.137 --> 12:53.139
get a rose from
is also Lisa.

12:53.205 --> 12:54.206
- So...
-

12:54.273 --> 12:55.441
I'm rooting for you, but
there's a small part of me

12:55.508 --> 12:58.677
that's like, "Oh, God, Lisa,
throw this guy under the bus".

12:58.744 --> 13:01.147
The sad part is, Chris is
going for that rose and

13:01.213 --> 13:02.314
Jeremy's going
for that rose.

13:02.381 --> 13:03.415
And that's the thing, man.

13:03.482 --> 13:04.517
Everyone's throwing a pitch
and to be honest, like,

13:04.583 --> 13:07.119
there's no context where
my situation's locked in.

13:11.423 --> 13:13.092
Every day is full of
beautiful opportunities,

13:13.159 --> 13:15.361
and I have an endless
amount of opportunities

13:15.427 --> 13:17.296
in front of me right now.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.298
You got this.
I'm not giving up.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.566
I follow through to
the end and

13:20.633 --> 13:24.170
work my butt off to
get what I want.

13:24.236 --> 13:27.239
And, nothing's
stopping me.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.441
Hey. Can I steal you
for a second?

13:38.651 --> 13:39.485
There's a rose
ceremony tonight.

13:39.552 --> 13:40.686
I'm not going home.
I'm not giving up.

13:40.753 --> 13:44.623
I'm looking for the future
with one person specifically.

13:45.624 --> 13:47.927
I'm going after her and
I'm gonna get her.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.461
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good, how are you?

13:49.528 --> 13:50.529
I'm good.

13:50.596 --> 13:52.831
From the first time I saw
Caitlin on the beach,

13:52.898 --> 13:54.466
I was drawn to her.

13:54.533 --> 13:57.670
After my date with Illeana,
I had like a gut wrenching

13:57.736 --> 13:59.605
feeling that I had made
the wrong choice and

13:59.672 --> 14:02.408
wanted to take Caitlin.

14:02.474 --> 14:04.476
Ah, first of all,
these are for you.

14:04.543 --> 14:06.378
Aw, thank you!

14:06.445 --> 14:08.814
I'm shocked to
see Adam here.

14:08.881 --> 14:11.283
And he brought
some flowers.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.653
I just wanted to say thank
you for being so

14:14.720 --> 14:16.789
amazing and kind
to me last night.

14:16.855 --> 14:20.593
Caitlin deserves the world.
She's just so beautiful and,

14:20.659 --> 14:22.194
I feel like Caitlin
hasn't had

14:22.261 --> 14:23.929
her special moment here
in Paradise yet.

14:23.996 --> 14:26.632
And, I want to
give that to her.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.668
I know I only have a little bit
of time left, potentially.

14:29.735 --> 14:33.739
But, I hope I can
spend it with you.

14:33.806 --> 14:37.443
I have had all this time with
Kamil and not once has

14:37.509 --> 14:39.979
he made an effort to do
something like this.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.947
And then, I have Adam
coming in and

14:42.014 --> 14:44.316
he's already making moves.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.685
I appreciate you coming
over here and doing this.

14:46.752 --> 14:47.853
Absolutely.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.623
No one's really made any sort
of gesture like this yet

14:50.689 --> 14:51.924
while I've been here,
so...

14:51.991 --> 14:54.426
I'm just a little, like,
skeptical about it.

14:54.493 --> 14:56.962
Like, is he doing this because
he wants to hang out here and

14:57.029 --> 14:58.664
spend more time
on the beach?

14:58.731 --> 15:02.401
Or, is he doing it because he's
actually interested in me?

15:02.468 --> 15:04.837
The rose ceremony, like,
I know it's tonight and

15:04.903 --> 15:06.405
there's pressure, but-
- Yeah, yeah.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.741
It's not why
I'm doing this.

15:08.807 --> 15:11.644
I'm like actually
interested in you and,

15:11.710 --> 15:13.412
would love to get to
know you today.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.547
- This is so cute.
-

15:15.614 --> 15:17.283
I'm glad,
I'm glad you like it.

15:17.349 --> 15:18.951
Caitlin's what I want and
I'm gonna go for it.

15:19.018 --> 15:21.754
And, I'm gonna get
that rose from her.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.689
I know that you had
something with Illeana,

15:23.756 --> 15:26.959
and I know that you're like
trying to explore other options.

15:27.026 --> 15:28.694
But I also don't
want to discount

15:28.761 --> 15:30.029
what I've had with Kamil.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.264
And I guess I'm just...

15:32.331 --> 15:33.766
worried about how-

15:33.832 --> 15:36.869
It's not really other options.
It's really just you.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.571
I'm curious about him.
I'm intrigued by him.

15:39.638 --> 15:40.806
I do have a lot to
think about now.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.041
Yeah.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.876
I respect his efforts.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.444
Okay.

15:45.511 --> 15:49.014
This is just, you know, another
bump in the road and...

15:49.081 --> 15:50.983
we'll see how it goes.

15:51.050 --> 15:53.352
- Thank you.
- Alright.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.020
It's cute. Ah, killing me.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.822
- I'll see you later.
- Okay, sounds good.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.624
Bye.

16:04.730 --> 16:05.998
Just follow your heart
and like, literally,

16:06.065 --> 16:07.800
whatever's supposed to
happen will happen.

16:07.866 --> 16:09.401
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.704
- How are you?
- I am so good, man.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.305
Can I steal you for
a second, Caitlin?

16:13.372 --> 16:14.873
Okay, how are you?

16:14.940 --> 16:18.043
I'm a little on edge right now,
but I'm feeling okay.

16:18.110 --> 16:20.746
- How you feeling, man?
- I feel really good.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.083
Yeah, I feel really,
really amazing.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.452
So, you, you're confident,
going into the rose ceremony?

16:29.588 --> 16:32.057
Ah, I'm, I'm
confident enough.

16:32.124 --> 16:33.959
Oh, yeah?
With, with who?

16:34.026 --> 16:35.494
Ah, with Caitlin.

16:39.031 --> 16:40.466
When did that happen?

16:40.532 --> 16:44.503
I was so shocked!
Adam just got off this whole,

16:44.570 --> 16:46.939
"I'm only focused on
Illeana situation",

16:47.005 --> 16:49.475
and now all of a sudden, he's
all about Caitlin, and...

16:49.541 --> 16:52.077
Is he genuine?

16:52.144 --> 16:53.579
So, tell me about your day.

16:53.645 --> 16:54.780
I mean, I haven't
seen you yet.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.349
And I feel like a lot of things
are happening to you and,

16:57.416 --> 16:59.985
I'm just like, kind of
unaware of what's going on.

17:00.052 --> 17:01.854
I am getting a little into
my head, but-

17:01.920 --> 17:02.788
which I shouldn't be.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.857
I may have thrown
like a little- well,

17:04.923 --> 17:06.925
no, not a little curveball.
A heavy curveball here.

17:06.992 --> 17:09.895
Illeana and I had this talk
last night and she told me

17:09.962 --> 17:11.497
she wanted to be with
Brendan S. And I was like,

17:11.563 --> 17:12.898
"Thank you
so much for telling me.

17:12.965 --> 17:14.767
I respect that.
I really appreciate that".

17:14.833 --> 17:17.870
And then, the first person
to walk up was Caitlin.

17:17.936 --> 17:19.738
And, 'cause she
was just amazing.

17:19.805 --> 17:23.475
She was like so kind
and thoughtful.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.477
I feel a little threatened
by another guy.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.713
He went after your best
friend yesterday.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.015
And, today's a new day and
he's picking a new girl.

17:30.082 --> 17:31.884
It's like, new flavour of
the week, you know.

17:31.950 --> 17:34.620
And I want to tell you, like,
that I'm in it for you.

17:34.686 --> 17:36.889
Like, no matter what girl
walks in, it's just you.

17:36.955 --> 17:40.392
I feel like Caitlin hasn't
been getting the attention

17:40.459 --> 17:41.360
and love and support
that she deserves-

17:41.427 --> 17:43.862
- That's true.
- I want to do that for her.

17:43.929 --> 17:46.432
And I don't just mean for
the rose ceremony.

17:46.498 --> 17:47.499
Yeah.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.867
I just want to know, like,
where I'm at with you.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.536
And, like, I'm having
trouble right now

17:50.602 --> 17:51.603
just figuring that out.

17:51.670 --> 17:54.506
I still care about you, and
I think I've made that

17:54.573 --> 17:56.842
like so incredibly clear.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.178
And, we just talked
and told her I was

17:59.244 --> 18:02.581
very much interested
in her and...

18:02.648 --> 18:04.116
yeah, it was great.
- Okay.

18:04.183 --> 18:06.685
Wow, this place never
seizes to shock me.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.786
It's a lot for me.

18:07.853 --> 18:09.421
Like, I've had all this
time with you.

18:09.488 --> 18:11.190
And like, I, I like
what we have.

18:11.256 --> 18:12.958
I haven't gone on a
date with anyone.

18:13.025 --> 18:16.128
I haven't had anyone really
express interest in me.

18:16.195 --> 18:18.697
Let me, let me,
let me figure this out.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.632
Caitlin, she's like my
ride or die chick.

18:20.699 --> 18:23.102
And, like I feel like a girl
like Caitlin deserves a guy

18:23.168 --> 18:25.070
with class instead of a
guy that's still stuck

18:25.137 --> 18:26.872
in his frigging
college years.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.148
Honestly, so I, I like-
I didn't want to be too,

18:36.215 --> 18:38.183
I didn't want to be too forward.
I want to be forward,

18:38.250 --> 18:39.918
but I want to
respectful as well.

18:39.985 --> 18:42.054
- What?!
-

18:42.121 --> 18:43.856
You spent like your entire date
making out with Illeana.

18:43.922 --> 18:45.657
Now you're scared
to kiss this girl?

18:45.724 --> 18:48.961
I don't know how snug things
are with Caitlin and Kamil.

18:49.027 --> 18:53.532
I don't put it past either of
them to kind of just drop it

18:53.599 --> 18:56.902
like a bad habit,
to be honest with you.

18:56.969 --> 19:00.539
Alright, go do your thing.
I'll be around.

19:02.741 --> 19:05.177
Alright, see you later.

19:05.244 --> 19:06.879
- We should chat.
- We should chat.

19:06.945 --> 19:08.046
I would love that.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.182
I feel the need to talk to
Adam because

19:10.249 --> 19:12.584
there's not a lot of time
before the rose ceremony

19:12.651 --> 19:14.586
and I think I owe
it to him to get to

19:14.653 --> 19:16.788
know a little bit
more about him.

19:16.855 --> 19:18.757
I would love to get a drink.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.492
What is your drink of choice,
by the way?

19:20.559 --> 19:21.527
You never said that.

19:21.593 --> 19:23.695
Ah, I've been
drinking mules.

19:23.762 --> 19:26.131
He made the effort to show
that he was interested.

19:26.198 --> 19:27.366
And, I know Kamil.

19:27.432 --> 19:30.569
But today I wanted to focus a
little bit more on Adam and

19:30.636 --> 19:33.572
see if there was anything...

19:33.639 --> 19:36.041
that sparked my interest.

19:36.108 --> 19:39.244
Alright, bartender.
What's up, buddy?

19:40.245 --> 19:42.247
Let's get a couple
Moscow mules, please.

19:42.314 --> 19:43.348
Thanks, dude.

19:43.448 --> 19:46.251
Wait, she's in the middle of
both of them right now?

19:46.318 --> 19:50.522
Oh, this is hella awkward.

19:50.589 --> 19:51.623
- Super awkward.
- Awkward.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.625
Yeah.
It's okay.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.227
This is interesting.

19:55.294 --> 19:58.297
Now Adam needs to
win over Caitlin.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.033
Like, one more time I hear
"Caitlin" and "Adam",

20:01.099 --> 20:01.967
I'm gonna explode.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.902
It's like, everyone's
watching the show.

20:03.969 --> 20:05.804
Where's the popcorn?

20:05.871 --> 20:08.674
No, it's not like that.
It's fine.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.310
It's real, bro.
It's not watching a show.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.212
Me and Chris had a bro game
today about how many times

20:14.279 --> 20:16.148
we'll hear Adam
say "bro" and

20:16.214 --> 20:18.016
it's up over 100
at this moment.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.252
- 217.
- Huh?

20:20.319 --> 20:22.020
- Nothing.
- What's that?

20:22.087 --> 20:24.690
"Bro. Hey, bro".
Like, "What's up, bro?"

20:24.756 --> 20:26.959
- I said, "217".
- 217.

20:27.025 --> 20:28.227
It's an inside joke
with Kamil and I.

20:28.293 --> 20:29.895
I like inside jokes.

20:29.962 --> 20:32.097
I usually like to be a part
of them, but it's okay.

20:32.164 --> 20:33.332
That's cool.

20:33.398 --> 20:36.068
He's just trying to like come
here with his chest up high,

20:36.134 --> 20:37.302
even though he has
a small chest.

20:37.369 --> 20:40.138
Just coming in all hot
and ready to go at it.

20:40.205 --> 20:41.974
Then it wouldn't be an inside
joke anymore, would it?

20:42.040 --> 20:45.210
- That's a, that's a fact.
- You guys, stop.

20:45.277 --> 20:47.679
You're all acting like
children right now.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.748
It's banter.
It's boys being boys.

20:49.815 --> 20:50.983
These guys.

20:51.049 --> 20:53.619
It's just like a claiming of
territory kind of thing and...

20:53.685 --> 20:55.354
it's not hot.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.823
As a gentelman,
I'll walk away.

20:57.889 --> 21:00.192
Let boys hang out.
Chris, come on.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.962
Hey, you can navigate social
scenarios with grace,

21:04.029 --> 21:06.598
or you can be a
about it.

21:06.665 --> 21:08.333
Adam's a about it.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.335
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to make
you uncomfortable.

21:10.402 --> 21:11.770
I don't mean to do that.

21:11.837 --> 21:13.205
That probably made you
so uncomfortable.

21:13.271 --> 21:15.040
Yeah, that wasn't ideal.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.709
How annoying
is that guy, man?

21:17.776 --> 21:18.610
Do you want to go
somewhere else?

21:18.677 --> 21:19.911
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.949
We should probably take
one of those off and

21:24.016 --> 21:25.050
put it in your hair though.

21:25.117 --> 21:25.917
In my hair?

21:25.984 --> 21:27.719
I think it would look
super pretty.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.022
Does Caitlin like the attention?
- I don't think so.

21:30.088 --> 21:33.725
I think she's just...
entertaining it.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.694
Entertaining it, eh?

21:38.430 --> 21:40.065
- Beautiful.
- Will it stay?

21:40.132 --> 21:41.767
Oh...

21:41.833 --> 21:46.805
Adam, Kamil, and Caitlin's
little situation is...

21:46.872 --> 21:48.140
very interesting.

21:48.206 --> 21:52.811
It looks like Adam has the
winning ticket here.

21:52.878 --> 21:55.180
And, Kamil is just on a
downward spiral

21:55.247 --> 21:57.115
on his way out of Paradise.

21:57.182 --> 22:00.052
Cute.

22:00.118 --> 22:02.821
Are they kissing?

22:02.888 --> 22:04.156
Not right here,
no, no.

22:04.222 --> 22:07.059
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, my God.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.927
That was awkward.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.262
I hope everyone saw that one.

22:10.328 --> 22:11.296
I saw it.

22:11.363 --> 22:15.801
Adam is a wild card.
Guy's all over the place.

22:15.867 --> 22:19.371
And then, he tries to make a
move on the beach

22:19.438 --> 22:21.339
right in front
of Kamil.

22:21.406 --> 22:23.942
Bro, what are you doing?

22:24.009 --> 22:25.110
Bam!

22:25.177 --> 22:28.146
He's like a wrecking ball.
He looks like a total clown

22:28.213 --> 22:30.082
trying to kiss her right
in front of me.

22:30.148 --> 22:33.118
And, that just shows
desperation on his end.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.353
He just got turned
down on a kiss, like,

22:34.419 --> 22:38.457
how far is this guy willing to
go before he gets the boot?

22:38.523 --> 22:40.926
If I went for a kiss with a
girl and she turned me down,

22:40.992 --> 22:42.227
you would back off.

22:42.294 --> 22:44.363
He just keeps going,
and going, and going.

22:44.429 --> 22:46.365
I feel like you should have a
flower in your hair every day.

22:46.431 --> 22:47.999
Oh, thanks.

22:48.066 --> 22:49.968
Going, and going, and going.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.136
Let me just get you
like a blanket and

22:51.203 --> 22:52.771
some pillows
and stuff, okay.

22:52.838 --> 22:54.206
I don't know when his
batteries are gonna run out,

22:54.272 --> 22:57.109
but hopefully they run out at
rose ceremony so, like,

22:57.175 --> 22:59.144
he can just be on his way
out to get a recharge and

22:59.211 --> 23:01.380
work his bro magic in
the real world.

23:01.446 --> 23:03.281
I mean, he's, he's going
home tonight.

23:03.348 --> 23:04.983
He has to.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.821
You grabbed the
whole couch?

23:09.888 --> 23:11.423
I was thinking about taking
the couch, I'm not gonna lie.

23:13.425 --> 23:15.460
Yeah, he's pulling all his
tricks out of his bag.

23:15.527 --> 23:18.930
It's like, everywhere I go,
I can't escape him.

23:18.997 --> 23:20.298
Feeling better?

23:20.365 --> 23:22.000
I think you just gotta like
let it out a little bit.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.002
I know what I have
with Caitlin,

23:24.069 --> 23:27.239
and I know this tool
bag won't change anything.

23:27.305 --> 23:29.307
Like, you're a rooster,
I'm a gorilla.

23:29.374 --> 23:30.909
Like, sit your ass down.

23:37.048 --> 23:39.451
It's nice to be
tucked away in here.

23:39.518 --> 23:41.987
I really want to spend some
time with Caitlin.

23:42.053 --> 23:44.222
This connection is
new and it's fun,

23:44.289 --> 23:46.291
and it's given me a
new passion and

23:46.358 --> 23:47.993
a new, a new drive.

23:48.059 --> 23:49.494
I just feel like there's,
there's so much

23:49.561 --> 23:51.897
more to her than even
meets the eye.

23:51.963 --> 23:54.366
And I can't wait to dive in
and dig a little deeper.

23:54.432 --> 23:55.333
That was awkward.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.235
I did want to kiss you,
but not right there.

23:57.302 --> 23:58.103
That's okay.

23:58.203 --> 24:01.406
It's risky spending this
time with Adam.

24:01.473 --> 24:03.108
Can I kiss you?

24:05.076 --> 24:06.611
But, maybe risk is good.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.251
Oh, my God!
Adam knows how to kiss.

24:13.318 --> 24:16.454
He's like very sensual.

24:16.521 --> 24:17.923
It's hot.

24:17.989 --> 24:20.091
But he's also like a
vortex when he...

24:20.158 --> 24:21.359
makes out with you.

24:21.426 --> 24:24.029
I'm very free and very-

24:24.095 --> 24:26.431
My entire face came
off on his face.

24:26.498 --> 24:28.066
I like your face on my face.

24:30.235 --> 24:31.369
- I think it suits me.
- Mhm.

24:31.436 --> 24:33.638
I feel like I just have so
much to get to know about you

24:33.705 --> 24:35.507
in like such a short
amount of time.

24:35.574 --> 24:37.476
I'm not gonna lie.
I was hopping to relationship,

24:37.542 --> 24:39.177
to relationship,
to relationship my whole life.

24:39.244 --> 24:42.013
When I finally realized that
I needed to take the time

24:42.080 --> 24:44.583
for myself and
work on me, I did.

24:44.649 --> 24:47.285
Like, my buddy...

24:47.352 --> 24:50.322
his passing was like, like...

24:50.388 --> 24:52.591
- You don't have to.
- No, no!

24:52.657 --> 24:56.027
I, I, I'm good, I'm good.
Like, it woke me up.

24:56.094 --> 25:00.599
And like, I need to live for me
and my best life.

25:00.665 --> 25:03.301
And to just really
relish and enjoy

25:03.368 --> 25:04.970
every single moment
that we have.

25:05.036 --> 25:08.139
He's a pretty deep guy.
He's been through

25:08.206 --> 25:10.242
some pretty traumatic
things in his life

25:10.308 --> 25:12.711
that have shaped him
to be who he is and,

25:12.777 --> 25:15.180
I think it's pretty like
commendable that

25:15.247 --> 25:17.549
he pulled himself out of a
really tragic moment and

25:17.616 --> 25:21.186
was able to push himself to
be a better version of him.

25:21.253 --> 25:23.121
Well, I mean, I'm glad it
made you who you are

25:23.188 --> 25:25.290
'cause you seem like a
pretty cool person.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.993
Thank you. You are pretty
amazing, yourself.

25:32.230 --> 25:34.399
As hard as it was for me to let
Kamil know that I needed to

25:34.466 --> 25:37.102
spend some time with Adam,
I'm happy I did it.

25:37.168 --> 25:41.506
And now I honestly just need to
think about what's going to be

25:41.573 --> 25:44.009
the best choice for me,
moving forward.

25:53.485 --> 25:55.453
Hey, hey, hey!

25:59.157 --> 26:00.425
Jesse! Woo!

26:00.492 --> 26:02.494
- Here we go!
- Yes, sir!

26:02.560 --> 26:04.296
I like that, I like that.

26:04.362 --> 26:06.231
Good evening, everybody.
How you doing tonight?

26:06.298 --> 26:07.599
- Good!
- So good!

26:07.666 --> 26:09.134
Okay, that's good.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.003
Well, it's been
a crazy week.

26:12.070 --> 26:15.140
With four new faces who've
joined the scene.

26:15.206 --> 26:17.008
Josh, you're one of them.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.510
How's Paradise
treating you so far?

26:18.576 --> 26:21.713
- It's fantastic, my man.
-

26:21.780 --> 26:24.583
That's good, that's good.
And Adam, how about you?

26:24.649 --> 26:27.052
It's been a dream, man.
It's been a whirlwind, but...

26:27.118 --> 26:28.553
yeah, it's, it's been magical.

26:28.620 --> 26:29.721
And you're ready for more?

26:29.788 --> 26:31.122
I'm definitely
ready for more.

26:31.189 --> 26:33.124
Well, listen, we've had
our fair share

26:33.191 --> 26:34.392
of romance on this beach.

26:34.459 --> 26:38.263
And we've also had our
fair share of drama.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.298
And I'm sure you're dealing
with the highs and lows.

26:40.365 --> 26:43.702
The ups and downs and the
emotional rollercoaster that

26:43.768 --> 26:46.504
comes with finding love,
here in Paradise.

26:46.571 --> 26:51.109
But, I'm encouraged because it
would seem like many of you

26:51.176 --> 26:53.778
are building some
incredibly strong bonds.

26:53.845 --> 26:55.614
That's a good thing.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.083
And for those of you
who haven't yet,

26:58.149 --> 27:00.452
or maybe you have,
but you're feeling like that

27:00.518 --> 27:03.254
bond is being tested
over the past few days,

27:03.321 --> 27:05.390
the cocktail
party tonight...

27:05.457 --> 27:07.726
is gonna mean
that much more.

27:07.792 --> 27:12.197
And for my 11 gentlemen who are
sitting here, sharply dressed,

27:12.263 --> 27:16.468
unfortunately, four of you will
be heading home this evening

27:16.534 --> 27:18.436
after our rose ceremony.

27:18.503 --> 27:21.239
So, the stakes are high.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.241
That means every moment
you have tonight,

27:23.308 --> 27:25.210
every second you
have tonight,

27:25.276 --> 27:28.646
you'll have to use wisely
and make it count.

27:28.713 --> 27:30.615
So, it's a cocktail party.

27:30.682 --> 27:32.550
I don't want to get too,
too up in it,

27:32.617 --> 27:34.119
but have some fun tonight.

27:34.185 --> 27:37.789
And remember,
do not hold back.

27:37.856 --> 27:39.557
This is Paradise.

27:39.624 --> 27:41.393
Jesse, thank you!

27:42.794 --> 27:45.497
- Wow, look at us!
- Yo, man!

27:45.563 --> 27:47.198
Thanks, Jesse...

27:47.265 --> 27:50.535
Going into tonight, I'm
searching for some clarity.

27:50.602 --> 27:53.772
There have been some red flags
with both Adam and Kamil.

27:53.838 --> 27:56.374
So, I just need to
talk to both of them

27:56.441 --> 27:57.876
to try and figure this out.

27:57.942 --> 28:01.312
Been a super long day for me,
being away from you.

28:01.379 --> 28:03.715
I had a lot to think
about and, it really,

28:03.782 --> 28:06.718
really did hurt seeing you,
like, with another guy and...

28:06.785 --> 28:07.685
Mhm.

28:07.752 --> 28:09.354
You know, like, the rose
ceremony is tonight,

28:09.421 --> 28:12.524
and I know what we have.
I just didn't want that

28:12.590 --> 28:14.592
to interrupt a
night like this.

28:14.659 --> 28:16.694
Kamil needs to put in

28:16.761 --> 28:18.563
a little bit more work.
He's been coasting.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.298
I think he's been
comfortable with me.

28:20.365 --> 28:25.470
I just have to think about what
could translate into the future.

28:27.772 --> 28:32.410
To finding yourself and
finding love in Camp Paradise.

28:32.477 --> 28:33.878
That was a good one,
I like that.

28:37.515 --> 28:39.884
- Mm-mm-mm!
- That was actually really good.

28:39.951 --> 28:41.352
You want to take
a walk, Lise?

28:41.419 --> 28:42.854
Sure.

28:42.921 --> 28:46.491
Josh is the only person showing
me any romantic side here and

28:46.558 --> 28:48.326
it genuinely means a lot.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.461
Alright, time to find out if
we're pizza compatible.

28:49.527 --> 28:50.495
I'm just gonna be
honest here, too,

28:50.562 --> 28:52.797
because I can't lie about
my favourite pizza.

28:52.864 --> 28:54.766
The important
questions in Paradise.

28:54.833 --> 28:56.801
A lot of people
don't like this-

28:56.868 --> 28:59.504
- Pineapple?
- Hawaiian.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.872
You're okay with
pineapples on pizza?

29:00.939 --> 29:02.373
Hell, yeah!

29:02.440 --> 29:03.608
Oh,
that's a relief.

29:03.675 --> 29:05.610
I know, I'm like these
are the important questions.

29:05.677 --> 29:07.479
Who do I want to be with in
the old folk's home,

29:07.545 --> 29:09.347
a guy that wants to share
the Hawaiian pizza?

29:09.414 --> 29:12.517
Some dude being like, "Yeah,
I loved you 25 years ago".

29:16.721 --> 29:19.390
I feel like I hadn't really
talked to anybody else

29:19.457 --> 29:22.293
in any sort of like
romantic capacity.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.263
And, I don't want
to feel like I'm

29:25.330 --> 29:26.898
pushing you to be
someone you're not.

29:26.965 --> 29:27.866
You're not, at all.

29:27.932 --> 29:30.969
By wanting, like, just
small reassurances.

29:31.035 --> 29:34.439
Like, even just telling me I'm
pretty, like, all those things.

29:34.506 --> 29:37.776
Like, I think that's something,
like I'm kind of looking for.

29:37.842 --> 29:39.944
You know, I am making an
effort and I feel like

29:40.011 --> 29:41.913
I want to make a bigger
effort every day.

29:41.980 --> 29:43.848
And like, things like this
today kind of like offset

29:43.915 --> 29:45.750
like what I really
wanted to do.

29:45.817 --> 29:48.253
And I know how it is to have a
relationship that I care about,

29:48.319 --> 29:50.855
and I want to show you
that I'm here for you.

29:50.922 --> 29:52.590
And I'll always
be here for you.

29:52.657 --> 29:54.459
Well, that's what I
want to hear.

29:54.526 --> 29:57.362
Yeah. Come here.

30:05.603 --> 30:08.640
I genuinely think about that.
I'm like, if I had kids...

30:08.706 --> 30:10.708
Do you mind if I steal you
away, Lisa?

30:10.775 --> 30:12.677
- Alright.
- Okay. Bye!

30:12.744 --> 30:14.412
David, step into my office.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.713
If I'm gonna get a
rose this week,

30:15.780 --> 30:17.248
my best chance is Lisa.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.716
You're in a
unique situation.

30:18.783 --> 30:19.984
Here's my outlook.

30:20.051 --> 30:21.819
If you do happen to
give me a rose,

30:21.886 --> 30:24.489
it would just mean you
forgive me and that

30:24.556 --> 30:25.690
would be really nice.

30:25.757 --> 30:28.426
As of right now, there is no
better place to be in Canada

30:28.493 --> 30:29.861
than here at Paradise.

30:29.928 --> 30:31.996
So, staying here would
give me an opportunity

30:32.063 --> 30:33.464
to meet someone special.

30:33.531 --> 30:35.533
If you need me for
anything, I'm here.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.401
Shit.

30:36.467 --> 30:38.002
Can I get Lisa for two
minutes, please?

30:38.069 --> 30:40.538
I'm gonna let the office
continue over here.

30:40.605 --> 30:42.807
I'm not sure where my rose
is coming from tonight,

30:42.874 --> 30:45.476
so I need to talk to Lisa if
I want to stay in Paradise,

30:45.543 --> 30:47.378
I need to get a friendship
rose from her.

30:47.445 --> 30:48.680
Just want to be real with
you and I have been

30:48.746 --> 30:49.914
real with you since
the beginning.

30:49.981 --> 30:52.517
I know that we might not have
worked out, but I feel like,

30:52.584 --> 30:54.552
just like you might feel
like a guy might walk in

30:54.619 --> 30:55.653
and might be your one-

30:55.720 --> 30:57.589
So, you're asking for a chance,
is what you're saying.

30:57.655 --> 30:58.723
Absolutely.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.758
I want Jeremy here,
but at this point,

31:00.825 --> 31:02.760
it's super platonic.
I love the guy,

31:02.827 --> 31:04.329
but would he
keep me safe next week?

31:04.395 --> 31:05.496
I don't know.

31:05.563 --> 31:09.734
I feel very confused and...

31:09.801 --> 31:11.636
I don't like it.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.805
Lisa, I've been trying to
talk to you all day.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.841
Alright, give me some love
'cause this man is waiting.

31:16.908 --> 31:18.943
I'm getting so many pitches
by so many guys last minute

31:19.010 --> 31:20.979
that I'm just like,
what do I do?

31:21.045 --> 31:23.882
Let me ask you about Josh.
- Okay.

31:23.948 --> 31:26.751
Do you think that
he's your guy?

31:26.818 --> 31:27.852
I don't know.

31:27.919 --> 31:29.554
Every guy that is coming to
me vying for the rose

31:29.621 --> 31:31.022
is honestly making
me emotional.

31:31.089 --> 31:32.223
I don't know if he's
being genuine.

31:32.290 --> 31:35.593
I don't know if this is like,
Lisa's the easy target and

31:35.660 --> 31:38.062
he has done the best at
giving me attention.

31:38.129 --> 31:39.397
Right, right, right.

31:39.464 --> 31:41.866
I would rather you
find love than me.

31:41.933 --> 31:44.068
If you give me
the rose tonight,

31:44.135 --> 31:46.804
I will have your back
the next time.

31:46.871 --> 31:48.973
I just feel like you can't
guarantee that.

31:49.040 --> 31:53.444
Literally, I will have
your back.

31:53.511 --> 31:55.480
Pinky promise.

31:55.546 --> 31:57.949
- You're being genuine?
- Yep.

31:58.016 --> 32:00.118
God, you guys are giving me so
much to think about.

32:00.184 --> 32:00.985
I hate it.

32:01.052 --> 32:02.020
You can take me to
the bank on this.

32:02.086 --> 32:04.555
Can I really bank on a pinky
promise that Chris

32:04.622 --> 32:06.658
would keep me
safe next week? Enh.

32:06.724 --> 32:07.859
I really do appreciate you.

32:07.925 --> 32:09.827
And like, I know, I know
the experience that

32:09.894 --> 32:10.795
you want to have here.

32:10.862 --> 32:12.730
And you know the experience
I want to have.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.004
I don't know what I'm
gonna do at this point.

32:20.071 --> 32:22.507
I am absolutely so
torn right now.

32:27.578 --> 32:28.546
What's up, buddy?
How are you?

32:28.613 --> 32:30.148
I'm doing good.
How are you?

32:30.214 --> 32:31.482
When we were on the
beach together,

32:31.549 --> 32:33.117
and I put that flower
in your hair,

32:33.184 --> 32:35.553
I really wanted to kiss you.
And I'm sorry for that.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.021
I'm sorry if that made you
uncomfortable.

32:37.088 --> 32:38.990
He's still trying.

32:39.057 --> 32:40.425
I think it's three strikes
you're out.

32:40.491 --> 32:41.893
That's the name of the game.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.129
I wasn't trying to throw
shit in Kamil's face.

32:45.196 --> 32:47.598
It was like, just, like I
really wanted to kiss you.

32:47.665 --> 32:51.436
Mhm. The whole like spiel
between the two of you at

32:51.502 --> 32:53.571
the bar, it was like,
I wasn't standing there,

32:53.638 --> 32:55.006
and you guys were just
doing this like-

32:55.073 --> 32:55.940
I'm sorry, yeah.

32:56.007 --> 32:58.443
Showboat thing, and like,
that's not hot.

32:58.509 --> 33:03.481
Thank you for telling me that.
Just, I'm sorry. Truly.

33:03.548 --> 33:04.782
This guy's like
relentless, man.

33:04.849 --> 33:06.451
Like, he won't stop.

33:06.517 --> 33:09.721
And I just hope like he, he
leaves as fast as he got here.

33:09.787 --> 33:11.589
I think it was important to
chat so I could get to

33:11.656 --> 33:12.824
know you a little
bit better.

33:12.890 --> 33:14.726
And I know it's hard
for you to articulate

33:14.792 --> 33:17.729
how you're feeling without
it coming across as like

33:17.795 --> 33:20.698
disingenuine because
you've had so little time.

33:20.765 --> 33:24.635
Honestly, I want to spend
like the rest of the time at

33:24.702 --> 33:26.804
Paradise getting to
know you even more.

33:26.871 --> 33:30.141
And, laying on the couch and
hugging and kissing,

33:30.208 --> 33:33.211
and getting to know the
deepest, darkest secrets...

33:33.277 --> 33:34.779
that you have.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.914
He's just taking time away
from me and her and,

33:36.981 --> 33:38.716
and time is valuable
here in Paradise.

33:38.783 --> 33:40.451
I want you to feel special.

33:40.518 --> 33:45.022
I want you to feel like
you should feel.

33:45.089 --> 33:47.725
Like you're in a fairy tale
all the time.

33:47.792 --> 33:50.762
As soon as I got to the beach,
I saw Kamil and just had that

33:50.828 --> 33:53.965
feeling in my gut that
that's what I wanted.

33:54.031 --> 33:56.968
But then I see Adam and I'm
confused because

33:57.035 --> 33:59.871
I see how hard he's
trying in this moment.

33:59.937 --> 34:03.674
And, I'm hoping that what
he's saying is real.

34:03.741 --> 34:05.109
I mean, I want
you to be happy.

34:05.176 --> 34:06.677
Again, like I said,
no matter what.

34:06.744 --> 34:09.480
- Oh, lord.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.683
- You're killing me.
- I will make you happy.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.519
I'm telling you that.

34:14.585 --> 34:18.122
This is just, it's so much
for me to handle right now.

34:18.189 --> 34:22.794
To process. Okay, well.
I'm here.

34:22.860 --> 34:25.129
I wonder what that's about.

34:25.196 --> 34:27.265
I have to talk to Illeana
right now because

34:27.331 --> 34:30.134
I need advice from
my best friend.

34:30.201 --> 34:33.171
I don't know
what to do, man.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.272
What happened?

34:34.338 --> 34:37.241
When I sat down, I knew I
wanted to be with Kamil.

34:37.308 --> 34:40.211
And then, Adam was sitting
there talking to me, and like,

34:40.278 --> 34:42.880
like saying all the
right things.

34:42.947 --> 34:43.948
I don't know.

34:44.015 --> 34:45.883
Tomorrow, who do you want to
spend the day with?

34:45.950 --> 34:49.220
What does your gut say?

34:49.287 --> 34:51.088
I don't, I don't know.

34:51.155 --> 34:54.192
Like Adam's worked so
hard the last,

34:54.258 --> 34:55.793
not even 24 hours.

34:55.860 --> 34:59.030
Like, I feel like I'd be
like silly to like say,

34:59.097 --> 35:02.066
to say no to someone
who's trying that hard.

35:02.133 --> 35:05.536
It's a lot for her right now
because 24 hours ago

35:05.603 --> 35:09.106
Adam was telling me how
deeply he feels for me and

35:09.173 --> 35:11.576
how he hasn't felt this way
in such a long time.

35:11.642 --> 35:13.611
And, after I tell him
I'm not interested,

35:13.678 --> 35:15.847
he's telling Caitlin
that he feels

35:15.913 --> 35:17.715
such a strong
connection to her.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.184
How do you even know
if he's genuine?

35:20.251 --> 35:23.287
It's either like getting rid of
someone that you already have a

35:23.354 --> 35:26.157
connection with because
you feel like he hasn't

35:26.224 --> 35:27.225
stepped up to the plate.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.627
Or, getting rid of someone
who's worked really hard

35:29.694 --> 35:31.729
in the past 24 hours...

35:31.796 --> 35:35.733
and trusting that Kamil is
gonna now step up to the plate?

35:35.800 --> 35:38.236
I don't want someone that
I have doubts with.

35:38.302 --> 35:42.139
And right now, I'm having
doubts about

35:42.206 --> 35:44.642
both Adam and Kamil.

35:44.709 --> 35:46.210
I'm so confused.

35:46.277 --> 35:49.347
I know. But what does
your heart say?

35:49.413 --> 35:52.650
- You don't know.
- No.

35:52.717 --> 35:55.253
I feel like I'm just like
stuck between

35:55.319 --> 35:56.921
a rock and a hard place.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.991
Like, how can I trust
someone after one day?

36:00.057 --> 36:01.792
I just don't want to make
the wrong choice.

36:01.859 --> 36:03.561
I know.

36:25.116 --> 36:28.719
Good evening, everyone.
18 of you stand before me.

36:28.786 --> 36:31.789
All in search of true love.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.324
And I know that your
connections have grown

36:33.391 --> 36:35.026
stronger each and every day.

36:35.092 --> 36:38.162
But unfortunately,
for some of you...

36:38.229 --> 36:41.199
those connections will not
be strong enough

36:41.265 --> 36:44.435
to keep you here
in Paradise.

36:44.502 --> 36:48.306
Ladies, you'll be handing out
the roses this evening.

36:48.372 --> 36:51.876
Going into the rose
ceremony, I'm confused.

36:51.943 --> 36:54.011
Like, so much has been
thrown at me.

36:54.078 --> 36:57.782
It's really just gonna come
down to that gut feeling.

36:57.848 --> 37:02.086
Gentlemen, 11 of you will
be looking for a rose.

37:02.153 --> 37:05.156
There are only 7 here beside me.

37:05.222 --> 37:07.725
I really want that rose from
Caitlin tonight and I'm feeling

37:07.792 --> 37:10.161
really, really confident,
but there's always

37:10.228 --> 37:13.364
that 1% chance that I
might not get it.

37:13.431 --> 37:15.266
Heading into this
rose ceremony,

37:15.333 --> 37:20.271
I feel super confident.
Straight up, that rose is mine.

37:20.338 --> 37:22.440
The 4 of you who do
not receive one

37:22.506 --> 37:25.376
will be leaving
Paradise... tonight.

37:28.846 --> 37:32.283
Good luck.
And if you're all ready...

37:32.350 --> 37:34.418
Let's get started.

37:34.485 --> 37:36.354
Vay.

37:42.293 --> 37:45.529
Joey...

37:45.596 --> 37:47.031
Joey, will you accept this rose?

37:47.098 --> 37:49.333
You betcha.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.436
Angela.

37:56.107 --> 37:59.910
Brendan M.?

37:59.977 --> 38:02.179
Brendan, will you
accept this rose?

38:02.246 --> 38:04.482
- Absolutely.
- Good.

38:07.451 --> 38:09.253
Stacy.

38:18.362 --> 38:22.099
Mike.

38:22.166 --> 38:24.835
I want to have the full
Bachelor in Paradise Canada

38:24.902 --> 38:27.004
experience, and I
haven't had that yet.

38:27.071 --> 38:29.140
It's been a struggle for me
the whole way through.

38:29.206 --> 38:31.042
Mike, will you
accept this rose?

38:31.108 --> 38:32.877
Damn right I will.

38:36.147 --> 38:39.583
I do want to stay here.
I'm not ready to go home.

38:39.650 --> 38:41.252
Illeana.

38:45.256 --> 38:47.358
Brendan S.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.296
Brendan, will you
accept this rose?

38:52.363 --> 38:54.298
Yes.

38:54.365 --> 38:57.168
I'm definitely stressed.
I'm not ready to go home

38:57.234 --> 38:59.870
'cause I feel like my one
could come at any time.

38:59.937 --> 39:03.240
Kit.

39:03.307 --> 39:05.476
Alex.

39:08.446 --> 39:10.014
Will you accept this rose?

39:10.081 --> 39:11.849
Indubitably.

39:16.287 --> 39:18.255
Lisa...

39:20.458 --> 39:22.326
I have made my
peace with Lisa.

39:22.393 --> 39:25.496
I have explained and showed
her who I am. And,

39:25.563 --> 39:29.900
if one of those guys comes in
and swoops her off her feet...

39:29.967 --> 39:32.203
so be it.
Bye, bye to me.

39:37.541 --> 39:40.277
Last week, I gave Lisa
a rose as kind of

39:40.344 --> 39:42.113
a token of an apology.

39:42.179 --> 39:44.048
I would really
love to stay here.

39:44.115 --> 39:45.616
If she gave me a
rose this week,

39:45.683 --> 39:47.585
it would show that
she's forgiven me.

39:54.992 --> 39:56.460
Josh.

40:01.031 --> 40:03.634
- Will you accept this rose?
- Absolutely.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.603
Josh is the only guy I've
kissed in Paradise

40:05.669 --> 40:07.104
that has meant anything.

40:07.171 --> 40:08.973
And, I have to think
about myself and

40:09.039 --> 40:10.574
what I want from this.

40:13.644 --> 40:19.416
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
the final rose for the evening.

40:19.483 --> 40:21.485
Caitlin.

40:24.422 --> 40:27.425
I am very close with Caitlin,
and I feel for her.

40:27.491 --> 40:31.629
She's so overwhelmed and
conflicted right now.

40:31.695 --> 40:33.931
And if I'm being
100% honest,

40:33.998 --> 40:38.202
I'm not sure either
Adam or Kamil...

40:38.269 --> 40:40.337
are a great fit for Caitlin.

40:46.410 --> 40:48.312
Kamil.

40:52.550 --> 40:53.751
Hey.

40:53.818 --> 40:56.554
I told myself that I would go
into this and follow my heart.

40:56.620 --> 41:00.124
And, my heart's with you.
So, will you accept this rose?

41:00.191 --> 41:03.460
Of course, yes.

41:03.527 --> 41:07.164
Sometimes you just look at
somebody and you just know.

41:07.231 --> 41:10.401
I saw Kamil and like,
just had that,

41:10.467 --> 41:15.339
that feeling in my gut that,
that's what I wanted.

41:15.406 --> 41:19.610
Gentlemen, if you did not
receive a rose this evening,

41:19.677 --> 41:21.579
please say your goodbyes.

41:23.614 --> 41:26.217
Bro, so much love,
my man.

41:26.283 --> 41:30.120
Oh, yeah!
Lots of love, my man.

41:30.187 --> 41:33.157
I didn't get either of the
girls I set out for.

41:33.224 --> 41:34.992
But, I left it all out there.

41:35.059 --> 41:37.094
I was me, I was genuine,
I was real.

41:37.161 --> 41:40.130
I'm happy for Caitlin.
But, I know that

41:40.197 --> 41:45.302
there is one really special
girl out there for me.

41:45.369 --> 41:47.338
I will not falter,
I will not fall,

41:47.404 --> 41:48.472
and I'm gonna keep
moving forward.

41:48.539 --> 41:50.207
And I'm gonna thrive to be
the best version of myself

41:50.274 --> 41:54.411
that I can be. If not for me,
but for my future one.

41:54.478 --> 41:56.080
I'm gonna find her.
I'm gonna find her.

41:56.146 --> 41:58.015
She can't hide for long.

41:58.082 --> 42:01.085
Honestly,
everyone's so fake.

42:01.151 --> 42:03.621
I'm like this.

42:03.687 --> 42:07.324
Get me out of here.

42:07.391 --> 42:10.694
I've learnt so much in such
a short period of time.

42:10.761 --> 42:13.063
It's not over.

42:13.130 --> 42:16.233
I feel sad right now.
I feel disappointed.

42:16.300 --> 42:20.437
But, I mean, she just
wasn't here this time.

42:20.504 --> 42:26.577
I'm a stronger person today.
The guy who leaves here...

42:26.644 --> 42:29.713
is not the same guy
that walked in.

42:29.780 --> 42:31.582
This isn't the end.

42:31.649 --> 42:34.652
This is when I truly
get to live my life.

42:34.718 --> 42:37.121
Look out.

42:39.356 --> 42:40.424
<i>Coming up...</i>

42:40.491 --> 42:42.459
Caitlin, do you mind if I talk
to you just for a sec?

42:42.526 --> 42:43.594
To me?

42:43.661 --> 42:48.465
I'm not here to cater to
another man's insecurities.

42:48.532 --> 42:50.100
Like, my heart is just pounding.

42:50.167 --> 42:52.069
I don't want people
coming at us.

42:52.136 --> 42:53.337
He had us all fooled.

42:53.404 --> 42:56.507
Are we all getting played?
Like, who's safe?

42:56.574 --> 42:59.209
I'm Mac Truck Mike.
If you don't move over,

42:59.276 --> 43:00.644
I'm gonna run you
off the road.

43:09.586 --> 43:10.921
- Ha!
- Hup!

43:12.423 --> 43:13.390
- Oh!
- Brendan!

43:13.457 --> 43:15.926
Oh, oh! I should 'a
had that. I know, I know.

43:15.993 --> 43:17.461
It is a new day in Paradise.

43:17.528 --> 43:19.597
We had the rose ceremony
last night.

43:19.663 --> 43:22.399
We lost some good soldiers.

43:22.466 --> 43:25.202
I just felt really bad about,
basically, sending home Jeremy.

43:25.269 --> 43:26.470
But, I've gotta
think of myself.

43:26.537 --> 43:27.438
Yeah.

43:27.504 --> 43:29.740
Really just excited to
take a breath and...

43:29.807 --> 43:31.775
see where the day takes me.
Spend some time with Lisa.

43:34.745 --> 43:36.947
Ange, what was that?

43:37.014 --> 43:38.716
- Hey.
- Hi.

43:38.782 --> 43:39.950
What's up?

43:40.017 --> 43:43.320
The rose ceremony is
finally behind us and,

43:43.387 --> 43:46.924
I woke up feeling so happy
that I chose Kamil.

43:46.991 --> 43:48.525
...Do they?

43:48.592 --> 43:49.760
Pfft! We missed.

43:49.827 --> 43:53.664
We just lost 4 guys which means
new girls are coming in and,

43:53.731 --> 43:55.232
the guys have
power this week.

43:55.299 --> 43:58.435
Here we go again.
Here we go again.

43:58.502 --> 44:00.204
I'm really, really worried
about the girl coming in

44:00.270 --> 44:01.472
and then, you know,
stealing our men.

44:01.538 --> 44:02.373
Mhm.

44:02.439 --> 44:03.841
As much as all the
girls are confident

44:03.907 --> 44:05.909
in their relationships...

44:05.976 --> 44:07.711
we're still all very worried.

44:07.778 --> 44:09.480
Right now, everyone's
kind of coupled off.

44:09.546 --> 44:11.515
As soon as those
new girls walk in,

44:11.582 --> 44:13.784
the tension will be in the air.

44:13.851 --> 44:16.820
And, all hell will break
loose, I'm sure.

44:19.657 --> 44:20.724
Oh, I see someone.

44:20.791 --> 44:22.960
I'm assuming she's
gonna be cute.

44:23.027 --> 44:24.661
Everyone's hot, so...

44:26.930 --> 44:29.533
I'm Bianka.
I'm 37 years old and

44:29.600 --> 44:33.637
I was on Brad's season
of The Bachelor Canada.

44:33.704 --> 44:35.973
That was 9 years ago.

44:36.040 --> 44:39.243
I have to like, do the math
'cause it was so long ago.

44:39.309 --> 44:41.679
And it didn't really go
anywhere so,

44:41.745 --> 44:44.915
going back into this,
at my age, at 37,

44:44.982 --> 44:46.917
I'm not here for games.

44:46.984 --> 44:48.085
Hi!

44:48.152 --> 44:51.021
The first thing I see when I
walk into the beach is...

44:51.088 --> 44:53.457
couple, couple, couple, couple.

44:53.524 --> 44:55.492
- Hi, I'm Bianka.
- Hey, welcome. Illeana.

44:55.559 --> 44:57.327
- Illeana, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

44:57.394 --> 44:58.729
- It's Bianka.
- Who's Bianka?

44:58.796 --> 45:00.531
Season 1 of Canada.

45:00.597 --> 45:01.598
- How are you?
- Bianka.

45:01.665 --> 45:02.866
Good.
Nice to meet you too.

45:02.933 --> 45:07.871
- She's 37.
- She's 37? 37?

45:07.938 --> 45:10.941
Don't know much
about Bianka.

45:11.008 --> 45:15.779
I do know she's in
her later 30s.

45:17.414 --> 45:19.783
- Hi, I'm Vay. Welcome.
- Vay? Everyone's so hot!

45:19.850 --> 45:22.352
- Yeah, welcome.
- Hi, I'm Stacy!

45:22.419 --> 45:25.289
My first impression of
Bianka is, she's 37.

45:25.355 --> 45:28.025
So, immediately,
I'm like... okay.

45:28.092 --> 45:29.126
- I'm Josh.
- Josh?

45:29.193 --> 45:32.963
- Nice to meet you.
- Bianka, nice to meet you too.

45:33.030 --> 45:38.001
In my experience, the older
a woman is, normally,

45:38.068 --> 45:42.673
they're more serious and they
want a guy who's very serious.

45:42.739 --> 45:44.374
And I'm 28 and I
can be serious,

45:44.441 --> 45:47.010
but to most
37-year-old women,

45:47.077 --> 45:49.046
I probably look like
a child to her.

45:49.113 --> 45:51.348
I was on the show before,
I'm Angela.

45:51.415 --> 45:54.518
I didn't say she was old.
I said she was older.

45:54.585 --> 45:55.519
- Bianka.
- Nice to meet you.

45:55.586 --> 45:56.720
Nice to meet you too.

45:56.787 --> 45:59.490
I can't say shit.
I'm in my 30s, too!

46:02.025 --> 46:03.994
We have a great bartender.

46:04.061 --> 46:05.762
He'll make you
most anything.

46:05.829 --> 46:07.931
Do you have tequila?
Yeah, I think-

46:07.998 --> 46:09.766
Can I get a
tequila soda?

46:09.833 --> 46:10.968
Okay.

46:14.505 --> 46:16.340
Guys, guys,
we have a new one.

46:16.406 --> 46:17.307
- We got a new one!
- Oh, shit!

46:17.374 --> 46:18.642
- We have a new girl!
- My God, a new one!

46:18.709 --> 46:19.710
Oh, she's coming in.

46:19.777 --> 46:22.746
I don't even know
who to expect.

46:22.813 --> 46:24.715
I'm Nicole, I'm 25,

46:24.782 --> 46:26.550
and I'm from
Mississauga, Ontario.

46:26.617 --> 46:27.918
I know that I'm
not that old,

46:27.985 --> 46:31.021
but I'm here to find
love in Paradise.

46:31.088 --> 46:35.926
A lot of people see this like
sweet, innocent Nicole.

46:35.993 --> 46:38.095
But it's like, once you
get to know me,

46:38.162 --> 46:41.565
there's a wild side.

46:41.632 --> 46:45.402
- Hello, I'm Nicole.
- Hey, Illeana.

46:45.469 --> 46:46.436
Nice to meet you.

46:46.503 --> 46:49.439
So, we have Bianka coming
down the beach and,

46:49.506 --> 46:51.642
5 minutes later...

46:51.708 --> 46:54.811
new girl walks in all cute and
smiley and all adorable.

46:54.878 --> 46:55.979
- Hi.
- How you doing?

46:56.046 --> 46:57.414
- I'm Mike.
- Nicole, nice to meet you.

46:57.481 --> 46:58.849
Nicole?
Good to meet you.

46:58.916 --> 47:00.484
- Hey, Nicole, I'm Josh.
- Hello.

47:00.551 --> 47:01.818
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

47:01.885 --> 47:03.720
Nicole's young, so
it's the complete

47:03.787 --> 47:06.890
polar opposite of Bianka. And,
she caters to an entirely

47:06.957 --> 47:08.525
different market
than Bianka does.

47:08.592 --> 47:09.993
Nicole, nice to meet you.

47:10.060 --> 47:11.428
- I'm Angela.
- Angela.

47:12.696 --> 47:14.798
I don't envy the new girls
coming in today on the beach.

47:14.865 --> 47:17.935
I could not imagine walking
into a group of people

47:18.001 --> 47:20.804
that are literally all
partnered off.

47:20.871 --> 47:21.772
How do you feel?

47:21.838 --> 47:24.141
I'm good, I'm excited,
but I'm really nervous.

47:24.208 --> 47:25.509
- Oh, that's okay.
- Yeah.

47:25.576 --> 47:26.577
Everyone's super cool.

47:26.643 --> 47:28.645
I'm coming into this, and
I want to get to know

47:28.712 --> 47:30.581
everybody and see
where everyone's' at.

47:30.647 --> 47:33.183
So, I'm gonna pull all the guys
and talk to them one on one.

47:33.250 --> 47:35.652
- Do you have any siblings?
- Yeah, I have three siblings.

47:35.719 --> 47:37.921
I have an older sister
and two older brothers.

47:37.988 --> 47:42.459
I'm here in Paradise to be
open to all of my options and,

47:42.526 --> 47:44.761
I just want to explore and
see where things go.

47:44.828 --> 47:45.929
Like, how old are you, if
you don't mind me asking?

47:45.996 --> 47:47.197
- I'm 25.
- 25?

47:47.264 --> 47:49.466
Oh, so you'll be the
youngest person here, eh?

47:49.533 --> 47:50.801
- Oh, really?
- I think so, yeah.

47:50.867 --> 47:51.969
Ow, wow.

47:53.103 --> 47:54.838
Like, how do you feel about
coming to Paradise?

47:54.905 --> 47:56.873
Anything, I can help you in,
in any way.

47:56.940 --> 47:58.575
I've done Paradise
before in the pat.

47:58.642 --> 47:59.776
- Okay.
-

47:59.843 --> 48:00.911
Oh, so you're not,
you're not new here.

48:00.978 --> 48:02.012
That's why I'm
the mayor here.

48:02.079 --> 48:04.448
That's funny.

48:04.514 --> 48:07.651
I'm talking to Kamil, and I
am very attracted to him.

48:07.718 --> 48:09.753
My advice to you is like,
just explore and

48:09.820 --> 48:11.455
see who you
really bond with.

48:11.521 --> 48:12.789
Like, you are, like,
really beautiful, so-

48:12.856 --> 48:14.591
Oh, thanks.

48:14.658 --> 48:16.693
I've heard he's feeling a
connection and

48:16.760 --> 48:17.961
it's pretty serious.

48:18.028 --> 48:19.129
Are you paired
up with anyone?

48:19.196 --> 48:22.966
Yeah, I've been with Caitlin
since day one, basically.

48:23.033 --> 48:24.968
But I mean,
we are in Paradise.

48:25.035 --> 48:27.037
That's why I'm
here to explore.

48:27.104 --> 48:28.839
So, we'll see.

48:45.222 --> 48:47.891
You worry me
sometimes, I swear.

48:47.958 --> 48:50.627
- Why?
- I don't know.

48:50.694 --> 48:51.662
No more drama.

48:51.728 --> 48:53.797
I'm excited to have another
night with Kamil.

48:53.864 --> 48:56.133
Yesterday was a good day
for the most part.

48:56.199 --> 48:57.334
Our time is limited here.

48:57.401 --> 48:59.703
Like, we want to spend all the
time we can get with that

48:59.770 --> 49:02.005
person so we can get to know
them and get to see if

49:02.072 --> 49:03.674
there is a future
beyond this.

49:03.740 --> 49:05.776
Have I been bouncing
around the beach, like,

49:05.842 --> 49:07.811
being super chummy
with everyone?

49:07.878 --> 49:12.983
No. I'm here to
find my person.

49:13.050 --> 49:14.651
Oh, I don't believe in
growing apart.

49:14.718 --> 49:17.621
I think a relationship takes
a lot of work and you really

49:17.688 --> 49:21.224
do have to, like, give time
to your relationship.

49:21.291 --> 49:22.993
I do feel like a lot of
people here are

49:23.060 --> 49:24.728
very, very, very
comfortable.

49:24.795 --> 49:28.732
Even with, like, the newbies...
-

49:28.799 --> 49:30.000
Coming in...

49:30.067 --> 49:33.770
I, even that aside, like,
why not mix it up?

49:33.837 --> 49:36.340
You know, do we have to
wait for a game?

49:36.406 --> 49:39.810
Things are getting very
comfortable in Paradise.

49:39.876 --> 49:42.079
And, I'm not here to
comfortable.

49:42.145 --> 49:45.248
I'm here to find my true match
through discomfort. Like,

49:45.315 --> 49:46.416
there's a beauty
in discomfort.

49:46.483 --> 49:49.586
I am for sure into Stacy.
I think she's super awesome.

49:49.653 --> 49:51.621
In order to make our
relationship even stronger,

49:51.688 --> 49:54.291
there's spending time together,
and there's isolating ourselves

49:54.358 --> 49:56.360
away from everybody
if we want.

49:56.426 --> 49:59.796
But, to put the irons
in the fire,

49:59.863 --> 50:02.799
comes out even stronger,
more tempered if...

50:02.866 --> 50:07.037
we kind of go on dates, come
back and say, you know what...

50:07.104 --> 50:09.072
- Not my person.
- That wasn't my person.

50:09.139 --> 50:11.641
Small part of me was actually
excited to have girls in 'cause

50:11.708 --> 50:13.844
some people here have
been very closed off.

50:13.910 --> 50:15.612
Like Caitlin and Kamil,
for example.

50:15.679 --> 50:16.780
And I never know
where those two are.

50:16.847 --> 50:18.915
Do you want to go hang
out with them?

50:18.982 --> 50:21.685
No, not at all.

50:21.752 --> 50:24.955
Caitlin, specifically,
at this point,

50:25.021 --> 50:29.226
I don't know anything about her
other than she rides horses.

50:29.292 --> 50:31.395
Therefore, I don't know if
she's a match for me or not.

50:31.461 --> 50:32.896
As individuals,
they aren't social

50:32.963 --> 50:33.764
with the rest of the group.

50:33.830 --> 50:34.798
It's a very closed off
kind of thing.

50:34.865 --> 50:38.034
The way I see it is, if you
want something or

50:38.101 --> 50:40.003
you're thinking something,
even if it's like,

50:40.070 --> 50:42.639
25% thinking about this...

50:42.706 --> 50:44.107
just go, go do it.

50:44.174 --> 50:46.810
I think Kamil saying,
"Stay in your own lane,"

50:46.877 --> 50:49.646
I think it did piss a lot
of people off.

50:49.713 --> 50:51.047
It pissed me off.

50:51.114 --> 50:55.085
I'm not here to cater

50:55.152 --> 50:58.722
to another man's
insecurities.

50:58.789 --> 51:01.425
I'm here to get in
people's lanes,

51:01.491 --> 51:03.994
figure out my best match.

51:04.061 --> 51:06.063
And, as far as I see it,

51:06.129 --> 51:08.965
Kamil is a bicycle in
a bicycle lane.

51:09.032 --> 51:12.235
And I'm Mac Truck Mike.
And if you don't move over,

51:12.302 --> 51:14.004
I'm gonna run you
off the road.

51:14.070 --> 51:16.373
And that's why I'm gonna ask
Caitlin on a date.

51:20.777 --> 51:24.414
Whoa, best spot in the
house right here.

51:24.481 --> 51:26.349
- Hi, Mike.
- Hi!

51:26.416 --> 51:28.118
Caitlin, do you mind if I talk
to you just for a sec?

51:28.185 --> 51:29.319
- To me?
- Yeah.

51:29.386 --> 51:31.254
- Sure.
- Okay.

51:34.758 --> 51:35.926
- What's up?
- Nice outfit.

51:35.992 --> 51:37.828
- Thanks!
- Is it leather?

51:37.894 --> 51:40.764
- It sure is.
- Oh, boy!

51:40.831 --> 51:42.399
I actually haven't really
spoken with you.

51:42.466 --> 51:45.469
Like, obviously, I think
you're very pretty.

51:45.535 --> 51:47.137
- Thank you.
- But I don't know you.

51:47.204 --> 51:48.738
I'm just gonna be
straight up with you.

51:48.805 --> 51:51.842
- I want to take you on a date.
-

51:51.908 --> 51:55.712
Um...
Oh, man.

51:55.779 --> 51:57.481
Mike, you're throwing me
for a loop.

51:57.547 --> 52:02.919
- I hope so.
- Um, ah...

52:02.986 --> 52:03.787
How about this.

52:03.854 --> 52:05.388
You don't have to
answer right now.

52:05.455 --> 52:06.389
I put a lot of
pressure on you.

52:06.456 --> 52:10.160
I think it would be really-
I'd be honoured

52:10.227 --> 52:13.296
if you'd come on a date
with me at some point.

52:13.363 --> 52:14.464
I'd love to take
you on a date.

52:14.531 --> 52:17.434
Okay.
Well, shit, Mike.

52:17.501 --> 52:21.137
I need, I need some time,
definitely, to think about it.

52:21.204 --> 52:22.772
I'll tell you what.
I'll walk you back.

52:22.839 --> 52:25.775
Okay. Oh, my gosh.

52:25.842 --> 52:28.912
I'm confused as to where
all of this is coming from.

52:28.979 --> 52:30.280
I thought everything between

52:30.347 --> 52:32.949
Mike and Stacy
was pretty solid.

52:33.016 --> 52:35.352
I've been tested so much
while I've been here.

52:35.418 --> 52:39.155
It's like every day there's
something new.

52:39.222 --> 52:43.226
Kamil?
Can you come here?

52:43.293 --> 52:48.832
- Okay. Are you good?
- Yeah. What's up?

52:48.899 --> 52:51.001
Mike tried to
ask me on a date.

52:51.067 --> 52:54.404
Wow, everyone just keeps
coming at us, huh?

52:54.471 --> 52:57.774
I told everyone in Paradise
to stay in their own lane.

52:57.841 --> 53:01.545
And, if Mike wants to talk to
Caitlin romantically,

53:01.611 --> 53:03.346
he should talk to me first.

53:03.413 --> 53:06.149
Like, I don't get how like he
could do that at this point

53:06.216 --> 53:09.019
and not see what we're
having together and try to,

53:09.085 --> 53:10.253
like, jeopardize everything

53:10.320 --> 53:13.123
he's been building
up with Stacy.

53:13.190 --> 53:15.192
He knows what
I have with Caitlin.

53:15.258 --> 53:18.228
So, why are you trying to
ask her on a date?

53:18.295 --> 53:20.463
You could've done that when you
first got here to Paradise.

53:20.530 --> 53:21.998
Like, why are you doing it now?

53:22.065 --> 53:23.867
Like, my heart is
just pounding. Feel it.

53:23.934 --> 53:24.868
Why?

53:24.935 --> 53:26.436
'Cause, like, this shit's
stressing me out.

53:26.503 --> 53:28.271
I don't want people
coming at us.

53:28.338 --> 53:31.241
I know, but as long as we're
confident in what we have,

53:31.308 --> 53:35.378
we just have to like shoo all
of these external distractions

53:35.445 --> 53:36.980
and factors away.

53:37.047 --> 53:38.381
- Come here.
- I just want you.

53:38.448 --> 53:40.483
I don't want any
other distractions.

53:40.550 --> 53:43.453
- I know.
- I just want you.

53:43.520 --> 53:45.121
So do I.

53:51.494 --> 53:53.496
I wonder how Stacy's
gonna react to all this.

53:58.602 --> 54:00.904
So, I wanted to tell you
straight up about

54:00.971 --> 54:03.273
what's going on.
- Mhm.

54:03.340 --> 54:05.842
I really don't know
Caitlin, at all.

54:05.909 --> 54:09.045
Because Kamil has
taken her away and...

54:09.112 --> 54:12.482
nobody sees them.
So, to be concise,

54:12.549 --> 54:17.854
I asked her if she'd like to go
on a date with me.

54:17.921 --> 54:21.257
Um... she hasn't said yes.

54:21.324 --> 54:23.093
She hasn't said no either.

54:23.159 --> 54:25.495
What did Mike do?

54:28.064 --> 54:31.601
I know that we have
something good.

54:31.668 --> 54:36.373
But I want to confirm
a few things to turn it to-

54:36.439 --> 54:40.377
from something good,
into something great.

54:40.443 --> 54:42.178
What are your
thoughts on all this?

54:48.284 --> 54:50.654
Can I get a bigger eye roll?

54:50.720 --> 54:52.355
I mean, obviously,
this is Paradise.

54:52.422 --> 54:54.224
I want you to go
explore your options.

54:54.291 --> 54:56.259
I want you to figure it out.

54:56.326 --> 54:59.229
I do find it quite
interesting that you had

54:59.295 --> 55:04.567
a lot of time to get
to know women...

55:04.634 --> 55:07.137
before you're in power
with the rose.

55:07.203 --> 55:10.440
So, I find the timing a little
bit hard to grasp.

55:10.507 --> 55:12.942
Well, you took
this better than

55:13.009 --> 55:16.513
I thought you were
gonna take it.

55:16.579 --> 55:21.685
Obviously, it feels,
like, horrible.

55:21.751 --> 55:23.053
Yeah.

55:23.119 --> 55:26.056
I mean, I want him to
go explore things.

55:26.122 --> 55:27.691
But at the end of the day,
a girl just wants someone

55:27.757 --> 55:30.460
to just like love them for
them. And right now,

55:30.527 --> 55:37.667
it's just like- Sorry, is
Caitlin more than me?

55:37.734 --> 55:41.071
Like, I just feel like
I'm not enough.

55:41.137 --> 55:43.973
Um, yeah.

55:44.040 --> 55:45.642
What can you do?

56:00.390 --> 56:03.526
- What's going on?
- Ah, let me tell you.

56:03.593 --> 56:05.428
So, Mike just
pulled me aside.

56:05.495 --> 56:08.565
And he said he wants to explore
things with, with Caitlin.

56:08.631 --> 56:11.501
- You're, you're with me?
- I literally kid you not.

56:13.369 --> 56:14.604
Mike?

56:14.671 --> 56:16.573
Can I chat with you for
like 3 seconds?

56:16.639 --> 56:18.174
You bet.
Why?

56:18.241 --> 56:20.243
He said that before, it was
just so coupled up,

56:20.310 --> 56:22.579
he couldn't get in. You had
multiple days when,

56:22.645 --> 56:23.847
when I had the
power of the rose.

56:23.913 --> 56:26.249
We spent all day every day
with these people.

56:26.316 --> 56:27.183
Every day on the beach.

56:27.250 --> 56:28.618
He did not have a
chance to talk to her?

56:28.685 --> 56:30.387
He felt like Kamil was
suffocating her.

56:30.453 --> 56:31.821
No, that's bullshit.

56:31.888 --> 56:34.791
I feel as blindsided as Stacy.

56:34.858 --> 56:37.894
Because if this is actually
what Mike has been thinking

56:37.961 --> 56:41.131
this entire time, he had
us all fooled.

56:41.197 --> 56:43.666
I'm sorry, I'm actually
shocked right now.

56:43.733 --> 56:46.236
Like, I, I don't get it.
How are you feeling?

56:46.302 --> 56:47.470
Shit!

56:47.537 --> 56:50.240
I felt like I've been like the
second choice this entire time.

56:50.306 --> 56:53.343
I'm actually speechless.
Like, I want to go smack him.

56:53.409 --> 56:54.878
Good job, Mike.

56:54.944 --> 56:56.413
This is not okay.

56:56.479 --> 56:58.681
This is, this is,
this is too much.

56:58.748 --> 57:01.551
There's no way Caitlin's
gonna step away from Kamil.

57:01.618 --> 57:04.420
I just feel like it's better
to chat about it now before-

57:04.487 --> 57:06.689
- True.
- Everything starts circulating.

57:06.756 --> 57:10.593
If we don't go on a date,
there's- then I'm not gonna

57:10.660 --> 57:14.564
get to know you on any other
level than friendship.

57:14.631 --> 57:17.534
But, the dates are there for
that reason of

57:17.600 --> 57:19.436
exploring something
past friendship.

57:19.502 --> 57:20.637
Yeah.

57:20.703 --> 57:22.639
Am I being too emotional?

57:22.705 --> 57:27.243
No, you are reacting the
exact way you're supposed to

57:27.310 --> 57:28.945
because you
know your worth.

57:29.012 --> 57:33.216
And, if you've been blindsided
by this guy this entire time,

57:33.283 --> 57:35.185
honestly, him.

57:35.251 --> 57:36.486
Stacy deserves the world.

57:36.553 --> 57:38.521
This is the third guy that
blindsides her

57:38.588 --> 57:39.722
and it's not okay.

57:39.789 --> 57:43.293
I am so pissed off right now
that he's doing this to you.

57:43.359 --> 57:46.262
Because now I feel like
everything he's done this far-

57:46.329 --> 57:50.834
- Is disingenuine.
- That's scary.

57:50.900 --> 57:52.569
It's just been like,
honestly,

57:52.635 --> 57:54.704
a whirlwind the
last like few days.

57:54.771 --> 57:58.908
And, I think it's super
flattering that you asked.

57:58.975 --> 58:01.544
But at this point, I just
think I need some time to like

58:01.611 --> 58:05.682
focus on where my heart
has been taking me.

58:05.748 --> 58:09.552
Rather than like continuing to,
you know, explore other things.

58:09.619 --> 58:14.624
I totally understand and...

58:14.691 --> 58:18.261
I, I get that you're under
a lot of pressure.

58:18.328 --> 58:19.562
Yeah, it's just, honestly,

58:19.629 --> 58:20.997
like after the
whole Adam thing,

58:21.064 --> 58:22.532
like, that was just
too much for me.

58:22.599 --> 58:23.900
I appreciate your honestly.

58:23.967 --> 58:28.605
- Okay.
-

58:28.671 --> 58:30.940
- Alright.
- Alright.

58:31.007 --> 58:35.478
Who's safe? Like, are we
all getting played?

58:35.545 --> 58:40.383
Like, who's safe?
That's really messed up.

58:40.450 --> 58:42.318
I don't know at
this point, man.

58:45.588 --> 58:49.025
- Speak of the devil...
- Hi.

58:49.092 --> 58:50.393
I'm the devil?

58:50.460 --> 58:51.928
Ah! No, that's
just a saying.

58:51.995 --> 58:55.632
Hey, I'm gonna... chat with
you, if that's alright?

58:55.698 --> 58:57.000
- Chat with me?
- Yeah.

58:57.066 --> 58:58.434
Okay.

58:58.501 --> 59:00.637
- We'll walk away, guys.
- Hold on, we'll-

59:00.703 --> 59:03.640
- No, it's okay, it's okay.
- It's all good.

59:03.706 --> 59:05.275
Stacy, come get us
if you need us.

59:05.341 --> 59:07.277
Okay.

59:07.343 --> 59:11.447
Um, so, We had just
spoken about all that.

59:11.514 --> 59:13.583
Yeah.
You bring new news?

59:13.650 --> 59:16.552
- I bring new news.
- Who else you going after?

59:16.619 --> 59:19.822
Well... yeah.
Let's see, here.

59:19.889 --> 59:21.624
No, ah...

59:21.691 --> 59:25.595
Caitlin pulled me aside and
she explained to me that

59:25.662 --> 59:27.730
she's committed to Kamil.

59:27.797 --> 59:32.468
So, I got my answer much
quicker than actually

59:32.535 --> 59:34.003
going on a date 'cause
I got rejected.

59:34.070 --> 59:37.674
I know that she
is now a friend.

59:37.740 --> 59:40.476
And that is all that
it will ever be.

59:40.543 --> 59:42.812
I want to just let you know,

59:42.879 --> 59:46.683
I was doing that from a
place of discovery.

59:46.749 --> 59:50.853
It wasn't a place of,
"I can do better,

59:50.920 --> 59:53.856
now what else is out there?"

59:53.923 --> 59:55.959
Mike has been very honest
with me, and like,

59:56.025 --> 59:58.561
all I've asked for someone is
to be honest and open and

59:58.628 --> 59:59.796
that's what he's done.

1:00:04.033 --> 1:00:07.837
I need to see from him
that he's being real.

1:00:07.904 --> 1:00:09.973
I think, for me, the biggest
shock was the fact that

1:00:10.039 --> 1:00:11.107
she's been here previously,

1:00:11.174 --> 1:00:14.043
and you had a little bit of
time to get to know her.

1:00:14.110 --> 1:00:15.912
So, it's like, I don't need
to know names,

1:00:15.979 --> 1:00:17.947
but is there anyone
else you're,

1:00:18.014 --> 1:00:19.916
that's been here before?
You know?

1:00:19.983 --> 1:00:21.784
No, yeah, that's a
fair question.

1:00:21.851 --> 1:00:25.121
And I'll answer it for you.
Um...

1:00:25.188 --> 1:00:29.392
No.
You are my love interest.

1:00:29.459 --> 1:00:32.996
And,
potentially, out of this...

1:00:33.062 --> 1:00:35.832
my girlfriend or more.

1:00:35.898 --> 1:00:41.871
I don't know.
I mean, agh, I don't know.

1:00:53.182 --> 1:00:54.684
Everyone's saying that
you're 25, yeah?

1:00:54.751 --> 1:00:56.552
Yeah, apparently,
I'm like young here.

1:00:56.619 --> 1:00:57.520
You're the youngest
one here in Paradise.

1:00:57.587 --> 1:00:59.956
Which I'm stoked about,
yeah.

1:01:00.023 --> 1:01:02.158
I feel good I'm not the
oldest one here in Paradise.

1:01:02.225 --> 1:01:06.729
I'm not one for going after
men who are seemingly taken,

1:01:06.796 --> 1:01:10.900
but if I see a man who has
wandering eyes and

1:01:10.967 --> 1:01:12.135
they're checking me out,

1:01:12.201 --> 1:01:14.704
I am tempted to
explore that.

1:01:14.771 --> 1:01:17.040
Do you have any
questions for me,

1:01:17.106 --> 1:01:19.642
since they call me the
mayor here in Paradise?

1:01:20.710 --> 1:01:23.513
Nicole is really pretty.
Her natural beauty is

1:01:23.579 --> 1:01:25.581
turning a lot of heads
here in Paradise.

1:01:25.648 --> 1:01:29.752
I mean, I, I looked, and my
neck is killing me today, so...

1:01:29.819 --> 1:01:31.054
I want to know more
about her, you know,

1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:32.522
I just want to scratch
at the surface.

1:01:32.588 --> 1:01:33.723
Okay, here's a question.

1:01:33.790 --> 1:01:35.725
What are you looking for
in a person?

1:01:35.792 --> 1:01:39.028
Ah, somebody that has like
their life figured out

1:01:39.095 --> 1:01:40.763
in a way.
I, like, I have a house.

1:01:40.830 --> 1:01:41.764
I have a good job.

1:01:41.864 --> 1:01:44.133
Like, I have all, like,
the groundwork laid out.

1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:45.935
And I just want somebody
to like, you know,

1:01:46.002 --> 1:01:48.671
fit my kind of lifestyle.

1:01:51.774 --> 1:01:53.710
Testing a relationship
here in Paradise,

1:01:53.776 --> 1:01:55.111
it's tested by a date.

1:01:55.178 --> 1:01:57.947
By a new person coming in.
By, by a kiss.

1:01:58.014 --> 1:02:00.483
By, you know, somebody
trying to pull you aside.

1:02:00.550 --> 1:02:03.953
And, basically, that's what
Caitlin did with Adam yesterday.

1:02:04.020 --> 1:02:06.055
What do you think is
going on right now?

1:02:06.122 --> 1:02:07.790
It's okay, he's fine.

1:02:07.857 --> 1:02:09.826
I guarantee something's
going one right now.

1:02:09.892 --> 1:02:12.595
Guarantee it because she,
she wanted to talk to him.

1:02:12.662 --> 1:02:14.931
You said that when she
got to the beach.

1:02:14.997 --> 1:02:16.566
- Who said?
- Who, Nicole?

1:02:16.632 --> 1:02:17.733
Yeah.

1:02:17.800 --> 1:02:19.702
I mean, of course, everyone
here is coming in with the

1:02:19.769 --> 1:02:22.038
intention of leaving with
someone and, naturally,

1:02:22.105 --> 1:02:23.773
I'm going to be a bit
protective of

1:02:23.840 --> 1:02:25.808
what we've got
at this point.

1:02:25.875 --> 1:02:28.878
I'm so over it, man.
I'm so over it.

1:02:38.087 --> 1:02:39.722
Like, I understand that
there are challenges

1:02:39.789 --> 1:02:41.757
we have to go through in
relationships in life.

1:02:41.824 --> 1:02:44.193
And like, I have moments
where I'm so incredibly

1:02:44.260 --> 1:02:45.895
happy and then it's like-

1:02:45.962 --> 1:02:46.963
It's a rollercoaster.

1:02:47.029 --> 1:02:50.233
I'm just waiting for the
time for it to all derail.

1:02:50.299 --> 1:02:52.602
I don't get to breathe here.

1:02:52.668 --> 1:02:54.570
It's like a, I always say,
ride or die chick, you know.

1:02:54.637 --> 1:02:56.005
Yeah, exactly,
that's important.

1:02:56.072 --> 1:02:58.074
Like, no matter like how
hard like times get,

1:02:58.141 --> 1:03:00.877
like you'll always have someone
in your corner just, yeah,

1:03:00.943 --> 1:03:03.179
I got you, like Kamil, like
that's what I'm looking for.

1:03:03.246 --> 1:03:05.715
Somebody like also that's
really into family.

1:03:05.782 --> 1:03:07.850
Like family's huge for me.

1:03:07.917 --> 1:03:10.653
I'm just gonna go to
the bathroom too.

1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:12.789
I don't want to feel
like I'm crazy.

1:03:12.855 --> 1:03:14.791
No, you're
not crazy, dude.

1:03:14.857 --> 1:03:16.726
Oh, wow, you got something.
There you go.

1:03:16.793 --> 1:03:18.027
- Bugs are everywhere.
- It was huge.

1:03:18.094 --> 1:03:19.662
I don't know what it was.

1:03:19.729 --> 1:03:21.864
See, this is exactly what I
knew they were doing.

1:03:21.931 --> 1:03:23.232
My intuition was right.

1:03:27.303 --> 1:03:30.606
What the is going on?
- I'm shook.

1:03:32.208 --> 1:03:34.210
I'm like shaking.

1:03:34.277 --> 1:03:36.078
I get where Caitlin
is coming from.

1:03:36.145 --> 1:03:37.980
It's honestly up
day after day after day.

1:03:38.047 --> 1:03:41.684
It's every day.
Like, why?

1:03:41.751 --> 1:03:43.853
I'm just so sick of this.

1:03:43.920 --> 1:03:45.788
- Well, it was a pleasure.
- Thank you for this talk.

1:03:45.855 --> 1:03:46.956
Thank you.

1:03:47.023 --> 1:03:49.992
Why don't I
get my happiness?

1:03:50.059 --> 1:03:53.029
And my love story?
I've had enough.

1:03:59.936 --> 1:04:02.939
<i>Next time, on Bachelor in
Paradise Canada.</i>

1:04:03.005 --> 1:04:05.708
A storm is definitely on
its way to Paradise.

1:04:07.210 --> 1:04:10.146
There are so many girls here.

1:04:10.213 --> 1:04:11.747
There's new girls that are
walking in and

1:04:11.814 --> 1:04:13.683
I'm getting scared
to lose you.

1:04:15.051 --> 1:04:16.886
Naturally, I'm gonna be a
hit protective of

1:04:16.953 --> 1:04:18.154
what we've got.

1:04:18.221 --> 1:04:19.155
Better not steal my man.

1:04:19.222 --> 1:04:22.124
Campers!

1:04:22.191 --> 1:04:24.427
What's gonna get
thrown my way today?

1:04:24.493 --> 1:04:28.097
It's the Camp Paradise
bonfire.

1:04:28.164 --> 1:04:29.999
But, with a little bit
of a twist.

1:04:30.066 --> 1:04:31.234
- Always a twist.
- Of course!

1:04:31.300 --> 1:04:33.369
I think there are some
people that are thinking

1:04:33.436 --> 1:04:35.805
they're gonna take
some serious heat.

1:04:35.871 --> 1:04:37.773
Kamil, I don't want to pick
on you, buddy, I swear.

1:04:37.840 --> 1:04:39.709
Sounds like you are.

1:04:39.775 --> 1:04:42.245
Both Kamil and I have
a target on our back.

1:04:42.311 --> 1:04:43.746
You're in love?

1:04:43.813 --> 1:04:45.715
Enough is enough
and I'm over it.

1:04:45.781 --> 1:04:46.782
They can't win here.

1:04:46.849 --> 1:04:49.218
Paradise is going
up in flames.

1:04:49.285 --> 1:04:51.387
A little drama can be
exciting, right?

1:04:51.454 --> 1:04:53.456
I'm definitely open.

1:04:53.522 --> 1:04:55.925
I'm not closed off to
meeting new people.

1:04:55.992 --> 1:04:57.293
What the hell is he doing?

1:04:57.360 --> 1:04:59.128
I go after what I want.

1:04:59.195 --> 1:05:01.163
I don't' think she's afraid
to step on toes.

1:05:01.230 --> 1:05:03.766
Nope, I don't think
she gives

1:05:03.833 --> 1:05:05.835
I don't know how you, like,
wouldn't be able to

1:05:05.902 --> 1:05:07.937
see why that would
upset somebody.

1:05:08.004 --> 1:05:10.039
Alright, Caitlin!

1:05:10.106 --> 1:05:11.707
I just feel stupid.

1:05:11.774 --> 1:05:14.810
Part of me just wonders, like,
is the whole thing like ruined?

1:05:14.877 --> 1:05:16.345
Sorry.

1:05:19.815 --> 1:05:22.151
This PSA is for

1:05:22.218 --> 1:05:25.321
all the ladies and gentlemen
here in Paradise.

1:05:25.388 --> 1:05:28.424
I don't know, like, I don't
want to see disingenuine.

1:05:28.491 --> 1:05:31.927
They're so disingenuine,
it's disgusting.

1:05:31.994 --> 1:05:34.030
Disingenuine has to be one
of the most commonly

1:05:34.096 --> 1:05:37.066
misused non-words, words.

1:05:37.133 --> 1:05:39.769
I know it's hard for you to
articulate how you're feeling

1:05:39.835 --> 1:05:43.072
without it coming across
as like, disingenuine.

1:05:43.139 --> 1:05:45.041
It's not that they're
being disingenuine.

1:05:45.107 --> 1:05:46.976
But the way other people
perceive him is that

1:05:47.043 --> 1:05:49.211
he's trying to hide something
or he's disingenuine.

1:05:49.278 --> 1:05:52.014
Now I feel like everything
he's done this far...

1:05:52.081 --> 1:05:53.749
Is disingenuine.

1:05:53.816 --> 1:05:55.952
Disingenuine is not a word.

1:05:56.018 --> 1:06:00.056
It is disingenuous.
Use it wisely.

1:06:00.122 --> 1:06:04.160
Why has no one corrected
me my entire life?!
