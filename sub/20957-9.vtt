WEBVTT

00:00.124 --> 00:01.698
Previously on Wynonna Earp.

00:01.701 --> 00:03.250
You fell asleep entwined.

00:03.253 --> 00:04.620
It's a new thing. It's casual.

00:04.623 --> 00:05.601
My DNA test.

00:05.604 --> 00:06.968
You can't unsee the result.

00:06.971 --> 00:08.632
I'm not a child, Nicole.

00:08.635 --> 00:11.122
I should've known you two had
something to do with the curse.

00:11.125 --> 00:12.995
- What do these Widows want?
- Time.

00:12.998 --> 00:14.380
That little Tucker is dead.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.815
Hands on your head! Now!

00:16.817 --> 00:19.485
- Tucker!
- We need to work fast

00:19.487 --> 00:22.688
- until we find the last seal.
- The third seal? It's Doc's ring.

00:22.690 --> 00:26.054
A wedding ring, on the finger
of the best gunslinger alive.

00:26.057 --> 00:29.810
If those bitches in black break
it, Clootie the demon will rise.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.505
Hee-yeah!

00:39.507 --> 00:42.323
- I don't want to hurt you.
- Oh, relax. Mama came to play.

00:42.326 --> 00:44.019
Well... I got a big stick in each hand.

00:44.022 --> 00:46.073
Been there, done that.
Ended up with tennis elbow.

00:46.076 --> 00:48.891
Nice. Solid. Keep the enemy in mind.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.687
Bitches in black. Demon Clootie.

00:54.689 --> 00:56.889
- Kegels.
- Oh, nice!

01:03.196 --> 01:04.904
- Ha!
- Woo! High five!

01:04.907 --> 01:07.131
Good, good, good, good. Now,
visualize someone you hate.

01:07.134 --> 01:09.501
- Nicole Haught, two days ago?
- What?!

01:09.503 --> 01:11.637
I don't hate Nicole!
We just had a fight.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.503
Mm! Let your opponent get

01:14.506 --> 01:16.542
into your head. This
happens, you're a goner. Boom!

01:16.544 --> 01:19.678
Baby bump apology.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.947
Hey.

01:21.949 --> 01:24.316
You need to learn this, OK?

01:24.318 --> 01:26.081
'Cause the Widows are
not playing to lose.

01:26.084 --> 01:28.787
Well, hell hath no fury like
two bitches whose demon husband

01:28.789 --> 01:30.422
got shot by your...

01:30.424 --> 01:32.391
ancestor. Sounded a
lot snappier in my head.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.586
You know, I still can't get
over Constance being their

01:34.589 --> 01:37.396
sister-wife. Her outfits were
so fiercely non-polygamous.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.365
And turns out she was the nice one.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.533
Demon Clootie rises, the other two

01:41.535 --> 01:44.196
are going to wreak
havoc. So much revenge.

01:44.199 --> 01:46.099
We have to find the third seal.

01:48.037 --> 01:49.904
Uh... yeah, I'm going
to put a pin in that.

01:49.907 --> 01:51.996
What?! We don't have time
to put a pin in anything.

01:51.999 --> 01:53.538
- Just the tip.
- Hey, I think

01:53.541 --> 01:56.281
it's best that we stick...
I mean, focus on the Widows.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.684
- Do that. I need a favor.
- Yeah. Anything.

01:58.687 --> 02:00.871
- What's up?
- Uh... the night off.

02:00.874 --> 02:03.321
Why? Is it because of the whole...

02:03.324 --> 02:05.591
Dying and coming back to life?
No, I'm just glad I didn't

02:05.593 --> 02:07.582
- reincarnate as a dung beetle.
- Yeah. Me too.

02:07.585 --> 02:10.996
Yeah. And I'm gonna need the house too.

02:10.997 --> 02:12.931
More nesting?

02:12.933 --> 02:14.833
I just think we've
reached maximum capacity

02:14.835 --> 02:16.572
in the decorative pillow department.

02:16.575 --> 02:19.438
OK, fine. Listen. Everyone
will have the evening off.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.508
Boom, shakalaka!

02:22.510 --> 02:25.244
Hey!

02:25.246 --> 02:27.886
After we finish training, quitters!

02:27.889 --> 02:29.515
Come on.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.417
With great belly comes
great responsibility.

02:31.419 --> 02:33.952
Eyes on the prize, peeps.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.388
Eyes on the prize.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:47.368 --> 02:49.079
Afternoon, sir.

02:49.082 --> 02:51.603
Your sign boasts of
antiques and libations.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.605
If the latter includes whiskey,

02:53.607 --> 02:55.741
I'll have one of those.

03:02.616 --> 03:05.384
Sakes alive!

03:05.386 --> 03:08.993
Sir, that ring is a rarity

03:08.996 --> 03:11.230
Bring good coin if you're selling.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.792
I am not.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.894
- Surely you'll want to hear my offer?
- Not in the least.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.567
Now here's a lovely piece

03:21.569 --> 03:23.324
for any wall,

03:23.327 --> 03:25.938
if you're looking for a gift.

03:25.940 --> 03:28.740
I have not come for anything but the...

03:28.742 --> 03:32.044
I'm partial to its homeyness.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.046
Its whimsy.

03:34.048 --> 03:36.982
Always pictured it in a
bedroom. Perhaps a child's room.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.618
Wrap it up.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.653
I'll come back for it.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.669
Wrap it up?

03:57.671 --> 04:00.305
But Mr. Holliday, we're only

04:00.307 --> 04:03.041
just getting started.

04:03.214 --> 04:07.589
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

04:25.002 --> 04:27.032
Blood pressure's good.
Heart rate is good.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.934
Temperature... still a little high,

04:28.936 --> 04:31.537
but other than that, kind of perfect.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.639
Better than anything Black
Badge has ever given me.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.575
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean, I guess

04:36.578 --> 04:39.745
you can give me at least like,
six months' worth now, right?

04:39.747 --> 04:41.747
- Nuh-uh.
- Because me coming here

04:41.749 --> 04:44.083
once a week isn't convenient
for either one of us, right?

04:44.086 --> 04:46.585
The serum goes bad after eight days.

04:46.587 --> 04:49.606
This is the winning formula.

04:49.609 --> 04:52.575
Hey, I hate to pull rank, but...

04:52.578 --> 04:54.452
Since when?

04:54.455 --> 04:56.728
You need to accept this.

05:02.036 --> 05:04.469
"Forever Eternity."

05:04.471 --> 05:06.605
I know you guys think
the apocalypse is nigh,

05:06.607 --> 05:08.574
but a gift card to a funeral home?

05:08.576 --> 05:10.642
Kind of weird.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.579
A spa, OK? Massages,
facials, those type of things.

05:13.581 --> 05:15.881
Also, 30 percent off

05:15.883 --> 05:17.849
all services on Wednesdays.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.751
You two have done a lot for me.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.720
So... here.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.462
It's stupid.

05:24.465 --> 05:26.858
Look, I'm not really
good at these things.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.860
So can you please take
the God damn gift card,

05:28.862 --> 05:30.596
grab Doc Holliday and just...

05:30.598 --> 05:32.564
stick him in a hot tub. You're welcome.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.900
Can you really see Doc at a spa?

05:34.902 --> 05:36.969
Yeah. With you I can.

05:36.971 --> 05:38.971
Also some pretty sweet blackmail photos.

05:38.973 --> 05:40.572
Oh... yeah.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.076
I knew you had an ulterior motive.

05:43.079 --> 05:45.177
- Got me.
- Hm.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.846
Thank you.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.915
See you later.

05:57.091 --> 05:59.124
That is beyond disturbing.

05:59.126 --> 06:02.884
- Sorry I was a no-show.
- Just try not to miss

06:02.887 --> 06:04.563
- the actual birth.
- Could I do that?

06:04.565 --> 06:06.832
- Physically impossible.
- Well figure it out, slacker.

06:06.834 --> 06:10.168
- I thought you were good.
- Oh, I'm phenomenal.

06:10.170 --> 06:13.983
So... are you gonna do it naturally?

06:13.986 --> 06:15.807
Through... through my...

06:15.809 --> 06:18.931
Yeah, that's where it... Right?!

06:18.934 --> 06:22.022
No! I mean... are you
gonna do it drug-free?

06:22.025 --> 06:25.017
What medieval misogynist
lets a woman go drug-free?

06:25.019 --> 06:26.985
I need all the drugs, yesterday.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.721
Well, I could mix you up a cocktail

06:29.723 --> 06:32.124
that will make birth feel like
you're on a giant swan floatie

06:32.126 --> 06:34.059
being handfed chocolate by Chris Evans.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.961
Ooh! Captain, my Captain!

06:37.931 --> 06:39.831
Hey, handsome.

06:39.833 --> 06:43.035
You know you don't have
to rock a straight razor

06:43.037 --> 06:44.870
- anymore, right?
- He claimed

06:44.872 --> 06:48.173
that he "tripped" on
something at the salt flats.

06:48.175 --> 06:51.571
- Some... thing?
- And now I am going for dinner.

06:51.574 --> 06:53.845
At Wynonna's.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.715
Oh!

06:56.717 --> 06:59.551
Cool. Awesome.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.721
I'll see you soon. And
I'll be in my truck.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.958
Well, feel free to lock up early.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.261
Sure.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.697
Aren't you gonna say goodnight?

07:11.699 --> 07:13.732
Goodnight.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.712
- She's very fit.
- Yeah,

07:26.714 --> 07:28.547
one of the best cricket
players on the Women in Blue.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.649
Yeah. She played an innings of 240. Yes!

07:30.651 --> 07:33.615
What?! There are 240
innings in cricket? Whoa.

07:33.618 --> 07:34.953
No.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.922
Yeah.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.091
Yeah. Duh! Come on.

07:39.093 --> 07:41.059
Since when do you care about cricket?

07:41.061 --> 07:42.745
I don't! But the boss
man loves all sports

07:42.748 --> 07:43.962
and I want him to love me.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.064
- Professionally.
- Subtle.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.633
Ugh! You know, I'm too hangry
to have this conversation.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.769
- Who emptied out the kitchen?
- Who do you think?

07:50.771 --> 07:52.771
She even brought her own grocery bags.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.173
Oh... right. Big dinner with Doc tonight.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.908
- Hey!
- Oopsie.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.617
Um...

07:58.620 --> 08:01.218
So, where's Nicole?
She's usually off by now.

08:01.221 --> 08:03.254
Hm! Speak of the devil.

08:03.257 --> 08:05.851
- Hey! Come on in.
- Hey.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.887
Sorry to interrupt... whatever this is.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.856
A body's been found.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.991
Oh! You sure it wasn't
someone else's body that you

08:12.993 --> 08:14.760
stole and hid because you
thought you had the right

08:14.762 --> 08:16.567
to make that utterly-not-your decision?

08:16.570 --> 08:18.597
Why would Nicole steal a body?

08:18.599 --> 08:20.799
Shut up, Jeremy.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.223
- Yup, got it.
- You think this is a BBD case?

08:23.226 --> 08:25.452
I think it's an everyone case.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.712
Oof. Poor thing.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.048
Hey, you recognize this?

08:37.049 --> 08:39.763
And that. He's allergic to penicillin?

08:39.765 --> 08:42.586
Yeah, I'm 99 percent sure
that's not what killed him.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.856
There's usually a name...

08:49.830 --> 08:52.864
- Oh.
- What?

08:52.866 --> 08:55.087
- I think you mean, "Who?"
- It's Tucker.

08:55.090 --> 08:57.090
Tucker Gardner.

09:00.839 --> 09:02.667
Oh no, no! No can touch,

09:02.670 --> 09:05.075
'cause that is not
appropriate or allowed.

09:05.077 --> 09:06.977
- His body is evidence.
- Mhm.

09:06.979 --> 09:09.146
- Yeah.
- Was he alive when he...

09:09.148 --> 09:11.348
Yeah.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.844
It's OK. It's better
that I know the truth.

09:13.847 --> 09:15.780
He did this to himself.

09:16.919 --> 09:18.989
Why would you think that?

09:18.991 --> 09:21.310
Tucker had many dark... proclivities.

09:21.313 --> 09:23.213
Fire was just one of them.

09:23.216 --> 09:26.609
I remember poor Blaze... our cat.

09:26.612 --> 09:28.332
Unfortunate name.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.868
Tucker always had it
out for the poor thing.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.903
Father buried the body

09:32.905 --> 09:35.406
and mother just pretended
it never happened.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.307
Mercedes always used to say,

09:37.309 --> 09:40.587
"One day that boy is gonna
light himself on fire."

09:40.590 --> 09:42.079
- Wow.
- Regardless, can you think

09:42.081 --> 09:43.881
of anyone who would
have wanted to hurt him?

09:43.883 --> 09:45.949
Can you think of anyone who wouldn't?

09:45.951 --> 09:48.819
When can we take him home?

09:48.821 --> 09:51.255
Oh, uh... a few days.
The autopsy procedure

09:51.257 --> 09:53.123
on a burn victims is
much more extensive.

09:53.125 --> 09:55.552
Death by fire is like the...

09:55.555 --> 09:58.294
Can I at least take
his personal effects?

09:58.297 --> 10:00.162
Mercedes will want to plan a service.

10:00.165 --> 10:01.680
Oh, I'm sorry, but it's...

10:01.683 --> 10:03.649
- Evidence.
- Yep, you got it.

10:03.652 --> 10:06.003
- Of course.
- But, um...

10:06.005 --> 10:08.539
Look, Ms. Gardner...

10:08.541 --> 10:12.071
I know this is a very difficult
time for you right now, but

10:12.074 --> 10:13.844
when you're ready, of course...

10:13.846 --> 10:16.113
Tucker was associating
himself with a couple of women

10:16.115 --> 10:17.948
that we've been looking for...

10:20.453 --> 10:23.320
- Just get water. Water. Water. Yep.
- Yes. OK.

10:26.859 --> 10:28.292
Hey.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.981
Am I the biggest cliché ever?

10:31.984 --> 10:33.497
No.

10:33.499 --> 10:35.399
I know what you're going through.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.367
Of course you do.

10:37.369 --> 10:40.126
Your father, your sister...

10:40.129 --> 10:42.005
How are you not bitter?

10:42.007 --> 10:45.175
Mm... I have my moments.

10:45.177 --> 10:47.177
You're so lovely.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.282
Thank you.

10:52.284 --> 10:54.118
I'm sorry

10:54.120 --> 10:55.953
that Tucker was so awful to both of you.

10:55.955 --> 10:57.988
- It's fine.
- No, it's not.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.869
Well, you of all people should
understand why Tucker was drawn

11:00.872 --> 11:05.160
to Waverly. Love takes on many
forms. What's deviant to some

11:05.163 --> 11:06.351
is normal to others.

11:06.354 --> 11:08.655
What are you trying to say?

11:08.658 --> 11:10.934
I know that Tucker was... odd.

11:10.936 --> 11:14.204
But in his own way, he loved Waverly.

11:14.206 --> 11:16.540
- That's no excuse.
- Nicole, stop.

11:16.542 --> 11:18.475
You're right.

11:18.477 --> 11:21.536
- I should go.
- If you need anything,

11:21.539 --> 11:23.764
at all, let me know. OK?

11:23.767 --> 11:25.934
You're an exceptional girl.

11:36.295 --> 11:38.996
I cannot believe she'd
try to rationalize

11:38.998 --> 11:41.331
- her brother's behavior.
- He's lying on a table,

11:41.333 --> 11:43.400
burnt beyond recognition.

11:43.402 --> 11:45.536
Sometimes lying is a kindness.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.604
Yeah, I tried that.

11:47.606 --> 11:50.140
With you. And look at us now.

11:50.142 --> 11:52.976
Waverly, that girl

11:52.978 --> 11:54.711
Tucker kidnapped and
brought to your room?

11:54.713 --> 11:57.347
He wanted it to be you.

11:57.349 --> 12:00.484
Trust me, OK? If you had seen the
look in his eyes, you would never...

12:00.486 --> 12:02.953
You know what I'd never do?

12:02.955 --> 12:06.156
Tell you what to think or feel.

12:20.568 --> 12:22.311
You shouldn't have.

12:22.314 --> 12:24.374
It looked more pleasing in the shop.

12:24.376 --> 12:27.010
How could it look more
pleasing than that?

12:27.012 --> 12:30.514
Dinner! Oh, no!

12:30.516 --> 12:33.350
I think it's burning! I
call this, "Shitty Day,

12:33.352 --> 12:35.419
Go Away!"

12:35.421 --> 12:37.721
Love me a one pot meal.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.464
Mm. Mm!

12:47.466 --> 12:50.000
Good, right?

12:50.002 --> 12:52.469
Scrumptious.

12:52.471 --> 12:55.038
It's better with the ketchup glaze.

12:57.643 --> 12:59.643
You gonna tell me
about that... that cut?

12:59.645 --> 13:02.485
Oh, I paid a visit to our
witchy friend at the salt flats.

13:02.488 --> 13:04.248
Because you're a masochist?

13:04.250 --> 13:05.691
Just not myself.

13:05.694 --> 13:07.746
Turned out to be a quick reunion seeing

13:07.749 --> 13:09.685
as Constance has been decapitated.

13:09.688 --> 13:11.743
You killed her?!

13:11.746 --> 13:14.493
If I had, I'd be dead. Mutually
assured destruction, remember?

13:14.496 --> 13:17.275
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well,
somebody destructed her.

13:17.278 --> 13:19.368
A witch, no less. So who? And why?

13:24.036 --> 13:26.503
This is sweet.

13:26.505 --> 13:28.639
Yeah. Waverly.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.008
Who buys one maraca?

13:31.010 --> 13:32.542
Don't they usually come as a set?

13:32.544 --> 13:35.512
Well, I believe it is
a rattle. For the baby.

13:35.514 --> 13:37.648
Oh...

13:37.650 --> 13:39.683
They shake things.

13:39.685 --> 13:42.653
- Oh God, it's gonna have hands.
- Yes.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.088
Two of them.

13:44.091 --> 13:46.089
And I thought that is
why you brought me here,

13:46.091 --> 13:47.852
to talk about the plan for the baby?

13:47.855 --> 13:49.601
No. No. But soon.

13:49.604 --> 13:52.429
Those goddamned Widows nearly
killed you just a day ago.

13:52.431 --> 13:55.098
There is no more "soon,"
there is only now.

13:57.303 --> 13:59.236
I know how you got the cut.

13:59.238 --> 14:01.138
Something demonic attacked you.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.173
- There will be more.
- And I suppose

14:03.175 --> 14:06.510
my next questions are, "And
how do you know?" And, "Why?"

14:06.512 --> 14:08.771
Because they're drawn to the
same thing we're looking for.

14:08.773 --> 14:10.017
The third seal.

14:12.117 --> 14:14.084
And you've got it.

14:19.325 --> 14:21.358
What are we waiting for?

14:21.360 --> 14:23.794
I can get you something else.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.830
I never drink alone.

14:26.832 --> 14:29.967
- Mm.
- It's sad and depressing.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.938
That's why we add the cherry.

14:32.941 --> 14:35.639
Thanks.

14:35.641 --> 14:38.642
No, thank you. You're buying.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.811
As you have been, all day long.

14:40.813 --> 14:43.280
I think the Virgil brothers
may have maxed you out.

14:43.282 --> 14:45.182
Hm?

14:46.584 --> 14:48.851
You forgot this at the baby shower.

14:50.189 --> 14:52.856
I guess blind rage can do that to you.

14:52.858 --> 14:55.158
Oh, God. Was it bad?

14:55.160 --> 14:57.427
More than classic, less than epic.

14:58.764 --> 15:01.098
Guess you two are still in your

15:01.100 --> 15:03.894
post-fight lull? That's the worst.

15:03.897 --> 15:06.169
No. The worst is going for round two,

15:06.171 --> 15:08.305
and then three, and I can't even go home

15:08.307 --> 15:09.840
because Wynonna and Doc are...

15:09.842 --> 15:11.641
Oh, fudgenuggets.

15:11.643 --> 15:13.577
Sorry.

15:13.579 --> 15:17.114
- It's all good.
- Mm...

15:17.116 --> 15:19.168
You're not a fairy godmother, are you?

15:19.171 --> 15:20.704
Mm... no.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.488
Terribleness is coming
but I would do anything

15:24.490 --> 15:27.290
to get out of here, just for one night.

15:27.292 --> 15:28.692
Huh.

15:29.959 --> 15:31.407
What?

15:33.727 --> 15:35.693
Bibbity boppity boo!

15:35.696 --> 15:38.269
Sorry, it's all I had.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.240
Well, luckily I'd already

15:43.242 --> 15:46.065
lost my appetite. Now,
what is this third seal

15:46.068 --> 15:48.268
I supposedly have on my person?

15:48.271 --> 15:50.347
It's your ring.

15:50.349 --> 15:53.034
And I need it.

15:53.037 --> 15:54.851
Ask to borrow anything else.

15:54.853 --> 15:56.183
Anything at all.

15:56.186 --> 15:58.206
I don't want to borrow it. I w...

15:58.209 --> 16:00.898
- I've decided I want to break it.
- Break the third seal?

16:00.901 --> 16:03.160
- Yes. Yes.
- Clootie will rise.

16:03.162 --> 16:05.128
The demon responsible
for the Earp Curse.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.464
The curse I'm also gonna
break when I kill him.

16:09.735 --> 16:13.471
Say something. Preferably encouraging.

16:13.474 --> 16:16.208
Like, "What? Sick plan!"

16:16.211 --> 16:17.908
Or "Go, Earp!"

16:17.910 --> 16:19.576
Are you completely insane?

16:19.579 --> 16:21.678
I like my ideas better.

16:38.515 --> 16:40.652
They had seven different infused waters.

16:40.655 --> 16:42.803
I didn't know what you'd
like so I got strawberry,

16:42.805 --> 16:44.605
lemon and cucumber.

16:44.607 --> 16:46.306
What, they didn't have peach?

16:46.308 --> 16:48.575
Oh, damn it! They did have peach.

16:48.577 --> 16:50.577
- I'm...
- Oh.

16:50.579 --> 16:53.580
OK. Good one. Here.

16:53.582 --> 16:55.883
Thanks.

16:55.885 --> 16:57.985
Are you cold?

17:00.222 --> 17:02.256
We're in a hot tub. Hot.

17:02.258 --> 17:03.915
Right.

17:03.918 --> 17:06.160
Maybe I should get us
some towels. They're like,

17:06.162 --> 17:08.095
- an inch thick.
- Waverly.

17:08.097 --> 17:11.381
Well... this feels weird!

17:11.384 --> 17:13.767
OK, what if the Widows come back? Huh?

17:13.769 --> 17:16.203
What if... what if
we find the third seal

17:16.204 --> 17:17.896
and I'm not there to help?

17:17.898 --> 17:20.295
Is this your thing? Cute but annoying?

17:22.077 --> 17:24.278
Sorry.

17:24.280 --> 17:25.878
You know, I'll leave you alone.

17:25.881 --> 17:27.915
OK. Just...

17:27.916 --> 17:30.884
Look, keep calm and drink champagne.

17:32.288 --> 17:34.855
Just take care of yourself for once.

17:37.693 --> 17:39.326
Close your eyes.

17:45.327 --> 17:47.427
- The towels really are great.
- I know.

17:47.430 --> 17:49.764
I shoved a couple in my bag already.

17:53.809 --> 17:56.977
Oh my God!

17:56.979 --> 17:58.812
I saw it with my own eyes,

17:58.814 --> 18:00.481
in the vision quest.

18:00.484 --> 18:02.749
Constance created her
seal, the third seal...

18:03.819 --> 18:05.473
That ring is it.

18:05.476 --> 18:07.187
This ring is the key to my immortality.

18:07.189 --> 18:08.738
Agelessness.

18:08.741 --> 18:10.717
- Beg pardon?
- You're not immortal, right?

18:10.720 --> 18:13.360
You just don't get old.

18:13.362 --> 18:15.028
Isn't that getting boring?

18:15.030 --> 18:16.858
You dare be so glib with my life?

18:16.861 --> 18:18.022
No. I dare to try

18:18.025 --> 18:20.313
to make mine and my family's safer.

18:20.316 --> 18:23.303
I saw the Widows
destroy the second seal.

18:23.305 --> 18:26.240
It requires a devilry I'm not
certain even you can muster.

18:26.242 --> 18:28.909
Well, you've seen me
before coffee, right?

18:28.911 --> 18:30.944
And if you break it,
and if Clootie rises,

18:30.946 --> 18:33.280
how do you propose to
kill the mighty demon

18:33.282 --> 18:35.616
Wyatt himself could not put in the grave

18:35.618 --> 18:37.117
- for good?
- We'll figure it out,

18:37.119 --> 18:39.186
and then we'll end the curse.

18:39.188 --> 18:41.054
Doc, we'll end it!

18:41.056 --> 18:42.656
Together.

18:42.658 --> 18:45.709
Not like this. The risk is too great.

18:45.712 --> 18:47.861
I may have betrayed Wyatt,

18:47.863 --> 18:50.764
but I vowed to spend the rest
of my life protecting the Earps.

18:50.766 --> 18:54.067
Well, how convenient. When did you
supposedly make this sacred vow?

18:54.690 --> 18:56.289
The moment I laid eyes on you.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.710
- Oh.
- I cannot protect

19:01.713 --> 19:03.631
- you if I am dead.
- If I believed this would

19:03.634 --> 19:06.199
- kill you, I wouldn't ask.
- You break the seal,

19:06.202 --> 19:07.366
then I start to die!

19:07.369 --> 19:09.116
Only as much as any of us.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.440
You don't want to be one of us.

19:14.443 --> 19:16.529
You think you're better than that.

19:22.932 --> 19:24.731
You don't think

19:24.733 --> 19:27.223
I would have done anything
to get out of that well?

19:27.226 --> 19:29.793
Better than think. I know. I was there.

19:29.796 --> 19:32.363
You can't rewrite history
anymore, Doc. Someone gave you

19:32.366 --> 19:34.981
a chance, and you turned him down.

19:34.984 --> 19:38.474
This devil that left me to rot.

19:38.477 --> 19:40.747
- You saw who it was?
- Mhm.

19:40.749 --> 19:42.716
You ready for this?

19:42.718 --> 19:44.217
Robert Svane.

19:44.219 --> 19:47.321
Old Bobo himself.

19:47.323 --> 19:49.756
You were selfish then
and you're selfish now.

19:49.758 --> 19:51.425
Oh....

19:51.428 --> 19:53.794
You are one to talk.

19:53.796 --> 19:55.796
I think I need to leave.

19:55.798 --> 19:57.864
Doc.

19:57.866 --> 20:00.067
You can't run away from this.

20:03.038 --> 20:05.939
You drove me here yourself.
You insisted on it.

20:05.941 --> 20:07.874
Well, give me your keys!

20:07.877 --> 20:09.877
Give me your keys!

20:10.846 --> 20:12.045
Fine.

20:20.456 --> 20:22.489
- They were in here!
- Oh, I guess they just

20:22.491 --> 20:25.392
walked off on their own. I think
I'll take a page from that book.

20:25.394 --> 20:27.995
What are you going to do? Walk
all the way back to Purgatory?

20:27.997 --> 20:30.177
Yes! Because it is far
less painful than being here

20:30.180 --> 20:31.680
with you.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.569
Cops are dumb. Stealing is fun.

20:35.571 --> 20:38.338
My sister wife is pretty much done.

20:40.843 --> 20:42.867
Once true to her,

20:42.870 --> 20:45.489
now be true to me. The one that I seek

20:45.492 --> 20:47.114
please help me to see.

20:48.542 --> 20:50.745
Where are you really, traitor?

21:00.139 --> 21:02.529
Will wonders never cease.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.333
I'm headed out.

21:08.337 --> 21:10.170
Try and get your beauty sleep.

21:10.172 --> 21:11.711
You certainly need it.

21:11.714 --> 21:14.038
I thought you already
examined this seal.

21:14.041 --> 21:16.101
Yeah. but now that know
the Widows are the brides

21:16.104 --> 21:19.406
of the demon who cursed the Earps,
I'm like, why not? Fresh eyes...

21:19.409 --> 21:22.062
- Oh! Detective work.
- Yeah!

21:22.065 --> 21:25.152
Need another set of peepers
on the gin mill, do you, Ace?

21:25.154 --> 21:27.487
Duck soup for a jobbie
like me, long as you don't

21:27.489 --> 21:30.331
- gum the sting, know what I mean?
- No, I don't know what

21:30.334 --> 21:32.113
- you mean. What does that mean?
- Alright, daddy. Cool down.

21:32.115 --> 21:34.703
- I ain't your daddy.
- You're not my daddy. No.

21:34.706 --> 21:36.196
Uh...

21:36.198 --> 21:38.031
So you think the Widows killed Tucker?

21:38.033 --> 21:40.000
Yeah. They do like to
play with fire, so...

21:40.002 --> 21:41.568
So do you, you flameballer.

21:44.878 --> 21:47.174
Oh, hey, I've been working
on a vapor guard to protect us

21:47.176 --> 21:48.766
- from the venom they spray.
- OK.

21:48.769 --> 21:51.978
Because the whole paralysis
thing, you know. I'm not a fan.

21:51.980 --> 21:54.081
Um, hey, man, uh, I'm pretty sure

21:54.083 --> 21:56.083
- that's private.
- I'm just taking a look. Relax.

21:56.085 --> 21:58.712
Yeah. It's just, a...
scientist's journal is like

21:58.715 --> 22:01.021
a diary. There's a lot
of sensitive information.

22:01.023 --> 22:02.574
Formulas, test subjects...

22:02.577 --> 22:05.025
Yeah, but what if
you're the test subject?

22:06.895 --> 22:09.129
Here. Can you replicate that?

22:10.899 --> 22:13.066
Yeah. Totally. Just, uh...

22:13.068 --> 22:14.657
you know, I'm not...

22:14.660 --> 22:16.570
- I'm not gonna plagiarize, dude.
- Really?

22:16.572 --> 22:18.405
'Cause that serum keeps me from going...

22:18.407 --> 22:20.474
- From going Lizard King, yeah.
- Yeah, exactly.

22:20.476 --> 22:23.376
I know. But... man,
that's why we have Rosita.

22:23.378 --> 22:26.012
Well, Rosita isn't what you
think she is, bud. Sorry.

22:26.014 --> 22:28.482
Neither were you. You know, you fought

22:28.484 --> 22:29.975
to keep me in BBD

22:29.978 --> 22:32.418
even though they said I
didn't have the gonads for it.

22:32.421 --> 22:34.092
You're one of the good guys, Dolls.

22:34.095 --> 22:35.920
Yeah, but there are grey areas.

22:35.923 --> 22:38.069
Ow! Ow!

22:38.072 --> 22:40.039
OK, yeah, get it out, it's gonna bleed!

22:40.042 --> 22:42.596
- OK, OK. Count to five. Ready?
- OK.

22:42.598 --> 22:44.965
One... two...

22:44.967 --> 22:47.000
Hm. That's a good one.

22:47.002 --> 22:49.436
Holy Stephen Hawking.

22:49.438 --> 22:51.972
- What is it?
- Not human, that's for sure.

22:51.974 --> 22:54.141
It's a... it's a fingernail.

22:56.293 --> 22:59.045
Beth Gardner had a bandage
on the tip of her finger!

22:59.789 --> 23:01.823
I think we just found Widow number one.

23:06.077 --> 23:08.377
Step aside or I will
physically remove you.

23:08.380 --> 23:10.080
Two against one, Doc.

23:10.083 --> 23:12.325
Hey! Wynonna, your condition.

23:12.327 --> 23:14.461
That's not what this is about.

23:14.463 --> 23:16.396
Give me the ring.

23:16.398 --> 23:19.082
It's mine. I was destined to have it.

23:19.085 --> 23:21.535
You made a bad deal
and it went even badder.

23:21.537 --> 23:23.403
You think getting tossed
down that well, that dark,

23:23.405 --> 23:24.843
enclosed space, was arbitrary?

23:24.846 --> 23:27.040
No! Constance chose
that particular torture

23:27.042 --> 23:29.509
- especially for me.
- How you figure that?

23:32.648 --> 23:34.481
When I was 14 years old,

23:34.483 --> 23:36.583
my mama lay sick with tuberculosis.

23:36.585 --> 23:38.451
It was contagious,

23:38.453 --> 23:40.353
so they kept me from her side.

23:40.355 --> 23:44.024
I crawled into a space
beneath the house,

23:44.026 --> 23:46.159
under her room.

23:46.161 --> 23:48.089
And do you know what I did,

23:48.092 --> 23:50.807
- night after night?
- No.

23:50.810 --> 23:53.066
I listened to her cry.

23:53.068 --> 23:55.738
And beg. And pray.

23:57.417 --> 23:59.217
She died anyway.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.040
And I never again

24:03.043 --> 24:05.266
could stand tight quarters.

24:09.384 --> 24:11.218
What was her name?

24:11.220 --> 24:12.719
Alice.

24:14.712 --> 24:16.671
Stay with me.

24:16.674 --> 24:19.059
I'm pregnant, not helpless. Split up.

24:19.061 --> 24:22.095
Just don't shoot any of
my decorative pillows.

24:22.097 --> 24:24.097
I'll never find the right
colour combination again.

24:25.367 --> 24:27.300
You repeat this convo, you die.

24:30.894 --> 24:32.272
You do not!

24:32.274 --> 24:35.208
- Three?! Three PhDs?
- Well, technically two.

24:35.210 --> 24:37.444
Engineering and biochemistry.

24:37.446 --> 24:40.146
The... the astrology was
just an online certification.

24:40.148 --> 24:42.716
I was dating a Scorpio. I panicked.

24:42.718 --> 24:44.227
So you come from

24:44.230 --> 24:46.519
a rocket scientist, super model family?

24:46.521 --> 24:48.071
No.

24:48.074 --> 24:50.257
Well, they must be pretty proud.

24:50.259 --> 24:52.225
They aren't around anymore.

24:53.395 --> 24:56.162
It's OK. It was a long time ago.

24:59.099 --> 25:01.468
I... ugh. Can you answer her already?

25:01.470 --> 25:03.370
No! No.

25:03.372 --> 25:05.238
That's exactly what
Nicole wants me to do.

25:05.240 --> 25:06.700
So controlling.

25:06.703 --> 25:08.770
I'm trying not to look, but...

25:08.773 --> 25:11.778
- I'm seeing a lot of "sorrys."
- I know. It's just...

25:11.780 --> 25:13.780
This wasn't a squabble

25:13.782 --> 25:15.715
over a borrowed shirt.

25:15.717 --> 25:17.550
Well, what...

25:17.552 --> 25:19.519
- What was in those papers anyway?
- Stuff that made me

25:19.521 --> 25:22.122
realize that my whole
life has been a lie.

25:22.124 --> 25:23.970
Yeah, which makes the people

25:23.973 --> 25:26.626
that supposedly cared about me, liars.

25:26.628 --> 25:28.662
Wow, there it is.

25:28.664 --> 25:30.530
- What?
- Backbone.

25:34.358 --> 25:35.523
Fine.

25:39.077 --> 25:41.641
- Dear Control Freak.
- Uh...

25:41.643 --> 25:43.254
I will talk to you

25:43.257 --> 25:45.278
when I want to talk to you.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.181
- Oh...
- Until then,

25:48.183 --> 25:50.216
have a nice life

25:50.218 --> 25:52.645
hurting the people that you love.

25:52.648 --> 25:53.853
No! I, uh... don't

25:53.855 --> 25:56.323
send... like that. OK.

25:56.325 --> 25:58.591
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. What did I do?

25:58.593 --> 26:01.428
A little too much backbone.
But it's gonna be OK.

26:01.430 --> 26:04.097
Nicole was right to hide
those papers. I never

26:04.099 --> 26:06.299
should have looked at them.

26:06.301 --> 26:09.536
I messed up. We had it so perfect.

26:09.538 --> 26:11.116
Perfect is overrated.

26:11.119 --> 26:14.607
If everything was perfect, then
champagne wouldn't have bubbles.

26:14.609 --> 26:15.663
Hm.

26:17.579 --> 26:19.264
Bubbles are made up of carbon dioxide

26:19.267 --> 26:21.201
rising from nucleation points.

26:21.204 --> 26:23.116
And nucleation points
are these small defects

26:23.118 --> 26:25.481
in the glass that trap these tiny,

26:25.484 --> 26:27.754
vibrating pockets of the carbon dioxide.

26:28.887 --> 26:31.884
So, no defect, no bubbles,

26:31.887 --> 26:33.626
no magic.

26:47.142 --> 26:49.122
I'm... I'm with Nicole!

26:49.125 --> 26:50.328
I'm with Doc.

26:52.890 --> 26:55.382
I'm gonna... go get changed.

27:03.028 --> 27:04.824
Rosita? I'm so sorry.

27:04.826 --> 27:07.494
You were being so cool
and so nice and I...

27:10.632 --> 27:12.499
Tucker?

27:14.131 --> 27:15.170
Waverly!

27:21.589 --> 27:24.022
You were burned to
death. I saw your body.

27:24.024 --> 27:27.287
I'm the reason people
shouldn't pick up hitch-hikers.

27:28.829 --> 27:30.963
Rosita...

27:30.965 --> 27:32.998
What did you do?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.300
What did I do? I got frostbite.

27:35.302 --> 27:37.636
I almost froze to death
coming back here for you!

27:38.672 --> 27:40.939
It's OK. I'm here to save you.

27:40.941 --> 27:43.008
- From her?
- No.

27:43.010 --> 27:45.911
From those bitches who
call themselves my sisters.

27:47.982 --> 27:49.848
Backyard,

27:49.850 --> 27:51.467
four occupants in sight.

27:51.470 --> 27:53.537
Fingernail may not be enough for...

27:53.540 --> 27:56.040
probable cause, but tonight
I do not give a shit.

27:56.043 --> 27:58.522
Wynonna knew something was
off with those Gardner women.

27:58.525 --> 28:01.425
- I should have listened to her.
- I'm sending you a mental hug,

28:01.428 --> 28:03.195
- buddy.
- Not now, Jeremy.

28:03.197 --> 28:05.197
Not while I'm in tactical, OK?

28:05.200 --> 28:08.400
- Sorry. You sounded sad.
- Hey! Stay put and be quiet.

28:08.402 --> 28:10.669
Easy for you to say!
The more nervous I get,

28:10.671 --> 28:12.804
the more I talk. The more
you tell me not to talk,

28:12.806 --> 28:14.973
the more nervous I get.
It is a vicious cycle.

28:14.975 --> 28:17.142
Ack! Shut up!

28:17.144 --> 28:18.944
Hello?

28:27.855 --> 28:29.821
She's in a better place.

28:34.228 --> 28:36.261
You're shaking.

28:36.263 --> 28:38.363
- You killed my friend.
- She wasn't your friend.

28:38.365 --> 28:40.226
She was trying to corrupt you.

28:40.229 --> 28:42.334
- And you were letting her.
- What?

28:43.544 --> 28:45.477
I saw her kiss you.

28:47.520 --> 28:49.741
Don't lie to me, Waverly.

28:49.743 --> 28:51.843
You and me, we're good people.

28:51.845 --> 28:53.779
The others? They want to change us,

28:53.781 --> 28:56.048
blame us, make us their puppets.

28:56.050 --> 28:58.217
Please let me go.

29:00.688 --> 29:02.721
Why in the world would I do that?

29:06.860 --> 29:08.927
No one is upstairs but I swear

29:08.929 --> 29:10.585
someone is in this house.

29:10.588 --> 29:12.447
Clear down here.

29:12.450 --> 29:14.445
Found Peacemaker though.

29:14.448 --> 29:16.834
In the pocket of your coat.

29:16.837 --> 29:18.737
Oh! You think I...

29:18.739 --> 29:21.273
Well darlin', I'll take
your adorable magic gun,

29:21.275 --> 29:23.802
and I raise you a pair of
pistols and two gifted hands.

29:23.805 --> 29:27.012
Doc, shut up. Do you really think
that I would shoot you to get the ring?

29:27.014 --> 29:29.549
Yeah, I've been reading about
hormones. Unstable buggers.

29:29.552 --> 29:31.783
Oh ho! So you think that
because I'm... I'm...

29:31.785 --> 29:33.852
I'm the size of a giant cheeseburger

29:33.854 --> 29:35.754
with a baby cheeseburger inside me

29:35.756 --> 29:37.990
and maybe really hungry right now,

29:37.992 --> 29:40.359
you think that I can't handle my job?

29:40.361 --> 29:42.995
Things are different. You are
mere weeks from giving birth.

29:42.997 --> 29:45.030
No! Stop! Do not

29:45.032 --> 29:46.792
ever forget

29:46.795 --> 29:49.301
that I am the heir of
this God damn curse.

29:49.303 --> 29:51.470
And you know what? That means

29:51.472 --> 29:54.253
that anything that has
to do with the curse

29:54.256 --> 29:56.724
is mine. That ring included.

29:56.727 --> 29:58.543
- You think so?
- I know so.

29:58.545 --> 30:00.779
Then come and get it.

30:05.085 --> 30:06.888
Being a Gardner was suffocating.

30:08.023 --> 30:10.457
Mercedes and Beth were
always telling me what to do.

30:12.192 --> 30:14.092
Then one day, they changed.

30:14.094 --> 30:16.094
Gave me freedom, supported
me. Do you know why?

30:16.096 --> 30:18.422
They saw something unique in you.

30:18.425 --> 30:20.096
Yes! It felt like

30:20.099 --> 30:22.367
I finally had the family I wanted.

30:22.369 --> 30:24.836
I felt like... I could be...

30:24.838 --> 30:26.872
me.

30:26.874 --> 30:29.538
I guess you've always
known what that feels like.

30:29.541 --> 30:31.507
Not so much.

30:34.448 --> 30:36.381
I used to think you
were too good for me.

30:38.385 --> 30:40.319
Now I see how alike we are.

30:40.321 --> 30:42.421
Two lost souls.

30:42.423 --> 30:44.389
You said you found your family.

30:44.391 --> 30:46.193
I said I felt like I found my family.

30:46.196 --> 30:48.062
You have to listen.

30:48.065 --> 30:50.299
We can work on that.

30:54.159 --> 30:56.401
Mercedes and Beth
believe that you're dead.

30:56.403 --> 30:58.581
They'll... they'll be so happy.

30:58.584 --> 31:00.517
I want to be there when you tell them...

31:00.520 --> 31:01.953
That's not gonna happen, Waverly.

31:03.596 --> 31:06.211
Those things that look
like Mercedes and Beth?

31:06.213 --> 31:09.181
Aren't. It's gonna sound crazy,

31:09.183 --> 31:11.216
but inhuman creatures,

31:11.218 --> 31:12.984
demons, took their place.

31:12.986 --> 31:15.053
- They're possessed?
- No.

31:15.055 --> 31:16.555
The creatures have their own bodies.

31:16.557 --> 31:19.591
So your real sisters are OK?

31:19.593 --> 31:22.561
Hey, it's OK! Look,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

31:22.563 --> 31:24.596
I think one is still hanging on...

31:27.816 --> 31:29.883
But without a face, what's a girl to do?

31:29.886 --> 31:31.503
Oh, man...

31:35.476 --> 31:37.476
You're right. It's not funny.

31:40.981 --> 31:42.948
If these new sisters are so wonderful,

31:42.950 --> 31:45.517
- why would fake your death?
- Because it turns out

31:45.519 --> 31:47.285
they were the fakers.

31:47.287 --> 31:49.321
All their praise, approval.

31:50.257 --> 31:52.190
All lies.

31:55.562 --> 31:57.462
You wouldn't use me
like that, would you?

31:59.400 --> 32:01.299
Never.

32:01.301 --> 32:03.301
I'm gonna get you out of here.

32:03.303 --> 32:06.071
Whoa. OK.

32:06.073 --> 32:09.040
Hey, listen.

32:09.042 --> 32:11.209
I'm gonna get you out of here, OK?

32:17.017 --> 32:19.418
I'll be back.

32:19.420 --> 32:22.921
We don't need anyone else.

32:22.923 --> 32:25.223
We'll be each other's family.

32:26.346 --> 32:28.279
That's so sweet.

32:30.507 --> 32:32.874
- Oh, shoot.
- What?

32:34.233 --> 32:36.601
Well, my... my old family.

32:36.603 --> 32:38.537
Wynonna. She'll...

32:38.539 --> 32:41.129
She'll look for me, right?

32:41.132 --> 32:42.715
She'll never stop.

32:42.718 --> 32:45.343
But if... if I call her

32:45.346 --> 32:48.625
and tell her that I'm going
out of town for a while, then...

32:50.073 --> 32:51.940
we won't have to be fugitives.

32:52.719 --> 32:54.619
You're a clever girl.

32:54.621 --> 32:56.521
One call.

32:56.523 --> 32:58.623
I'll be listening.

33:00.125 --> 33:02.694
- I can smell you.
- More Burberry,

33:02.696 --> 33:05.196
less burnt-in-a-church than you'd hoped?

33:05.199 --> 33:07.499
Didn't know your department
delivered. Fantastic.

33:07.501 --> 33:09.360
- I'm starving.
- Ooh, is that why

33:09.363 --> 33:11.477
you killed Tucker? 'Cause
you couldn't barbecue us,

33:11.480 --> 33:12.946
so you got yourself a kids' meal?

33:12.949 --> 33:15.440
Why does everyone assume it was me?

33:15.442 --> 33:17.686
Surrender now and I might
give you some leniency.

33:17.689 --> 33:20.178
Like the time Black
Badge kept us in a box?

33:27.187 --> 33:29.354
I heard that we piped in
some pretty good muzak.

33:29.356 --> 33:31.990
- Don't mock me.
- Where's your sister?

33:31.992 --> 33:34.459
Give her up, I might be able to provide

33:34.461 --> 33:36.089
some sanctuary.

33:36.092 --> 33:39.003
- Tempting... but no.
- You said you'd do

33:39.006 --> 33:41.700
anything, you'd give anything
to ensure my happiness.

33:41.702 --> 33:43.735
You are one greedy girl.

33:43.737 --> 33:47.072
Oh, you! Yeah, I saw who you
were! You're a cruel, hard man

33:47.074 --> 33:49.174
whose pleasures came
from other people's pain.

33:49.176 --> 33:50.962
Sometimes I think you
really must hate me.

33:50.965 --> 33:52.997
Sometimes I do.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.113
Give me the God damn ring.

34:02.189 --> 34:04.155
Voicemail.

34:05.392 --> 34:07.392
Hey, sis. Uh...

34:07.394 --> 34:09.594
Things with Nicole are a bit tense

34:09.596 --> 34:12.120
so I'm... gonna skip town.

34:13.467 --> 34:15.433
Do some soul-searching.

34:15.435 --> 34:17.768
I might not see you for a while.

34:19.867 --> 34:21.766
I love you, Wynonna.

34:26.782 --> 34:28.679
We should go.

34:29.583 --> 34:31.049
Wait. Um...

34:31.051 --> 34:33.978
Wait. Can we go to my jeep first?

34:33.981 --> 34:35.981
I... Well, I need some clothes.

34:35.984 --> 34:37.656
I can buy you anything.

34:37.658 --> 34:39.690
Maybe some more modest skirts.

34:39.693 --> 34:41.760
Your hemline's been
creeping up over the years.

34:41.762 --> 34:44.763
Wrong, Douche-B.

34:44.764 --> 34:47.699
If a girl wants to flash some thigh,
ain't no one's business but her own.

34:47.701 --> 34:49.568
You're alive!

34:49.570 --> 34:51.636
Funny thing about being a revenant.

34:51.638 --> 34:54.205
It's really hard to get dead.

34:56.264 --> 34:58.700
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

34:58.702 --> 35:00.768
When my husband rises

35:00.770 --> 35:02.737
he will rule with me by his side

35:02.739 --> 35:05.707
in my true form, feeding off the vassals

35:05.709 --> 35:08.142
eternally bound to serve him.

35:09.713 --> 35:12.780
- Including you.
- I'm not much of a joiner.

35:12.782 --> 35:15.249
Say goodbye, Agent Dolls.

35:19.055 --> 35:20.621
Bye.

35:22.412 --> 35:24.012
- Watch out!
- Jeremy!

35:27.297 --> 35:30.131
It worked! This is the vapour guard

35:30.133 --> 35:32.266
I've been working on.
You know, with it I can...

35:32.268 --> 35:34.669
Oh, shit crumbs.

35:42.078 --> 35:44.178
Dude, next time I say

35:44.180 --> 35:46.760
Stay in the truck, stay in the truck!

35:47.817 --> 35:50.184
- Go ahead and shoot me!
- Come on!

35:50.186 --> 35:52.720
- What are you so afraid of?
- Damn it, woman, I just

35:52.722 --> 35:54.922
- told you to shoot me.
- Doc, listen to me!

35:54.924 --> 35:57.643
If I don't break the seal,
the Widows will find it

35:57.646 --> 35:59.544
and they will kill you anyway.

35:59.547 --> 36:00.862
Fine!

36:00.864 --> 36:03.211
I always knew you'd be
the death of me anyway!

36:15.778 --> 36:17.644
Somebody's a little

36:17.647 --> 36:19.814
over-dressed for dinner. Sorry,

36:19.816 --> 36:21.183
we already have a Dolls.

36:49.813 --> 36:52.246
You were right.

36:52.248 --> 36:54.882
Demonic forces are drawn to the seal.

36:55.919 --> 36:58.052
Those things I said...

36:58.054 --> 37:00.597
- Yeah, I meant what I said too.
- But it was the doll

37:00.600 --> 37:02.723
- that made us say them aloud.
- Was it?

37:07.230 --> 37:08.996
Doc, this is...

37:10.767 --> 37:12.667
it's about something bigger than us.

37:12.669 --> 37:15.036
- The demon Clootie.
- Our baby.

37:19.705 --> 37:22.076
I mean, I need to do
that on my own terms,

37:22.078 --> 37:24.011
but I promise I won't

37:24.013 --> 37:25.980
break the seal. Not until after.

37:27.050 --> 37:29.016
We... we need a plan.

37:29.019 --> 37:31.535
But when that plan is in place,

37:31.538 --> 37:34.793
I will break it... with you

37:34.796 --> 37:36.745
by my side.

37:52.075 --> 37:54.108
Do you swear?

37:56.791 --> 37:58.112
I do.

38:13.941 --> 38:15.908
You kept the receipt, right?

38:21.304 --> 38:23.371
Waverly!

38:23.974 --> 38:25.907
Waverly!

38:29.779 --> 38:31.946
Brother.

38:31.948 --> 38:33.848
It's time to come home.

38:42.025 --> 38:44.025
You truly love that girl, don't you?

38:44.027 --> 38:46.807
She's my angel.

38:46.810 --> 38:50.378
There is something. She's special.

38:51.799 --> 38:54.500
Too special for an abomination like you.

38:58.574 --> 39:01.108
Betrayal has consequences, Tucker.

39:02.445 --> 39:04.378
You wanted a girl?

39:06.950 --> 39:09.183
Well, I'll be your girl.

39:39.244 --> 39:41.144
I have been arrogant.

39:42.247 --> 39:44.459
When I first stepped out of that box...

39:44.462 --> 39:47.117
Oh, the freedom!

39:47.119 --> 39:49.862
Now Beth has abandoned
me, my craft has faded.

39:49.865 --> 39:51.521
Please. Please,

39:51.523 --> 39:54.191
I just need one more miracle.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.487
Myself to you

40:02.490 --> 40:04.649
I eternally give.

40:06.786 --> 40:09.052
Blood from myself

40:09.055 --> 40:10.907
spilled as I live.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.044
Reveal to me

40:14.046 --> 40:16.947
the seal of three.

40:16.949 --> 40:19.316
Command you by these rings.

40:19.318 --> 40:22.152
Be you forever my King.

40:22.154 --> 40:23.587
Husband,

40:23.589 --> 40:25.989
grant that which I seek!

40:25.991 --> 40:27.958
Constance's seal.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.665
The deed shall be done.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.634
I swear it.

40:37.636 --> 40:39.536
It is the law.

40:47.383 --> 40:50.151
You know, you lock shit up,
you think that people would

40:50.154 --> 40:52.616
- stay out of it.
- What, boyfriend people?

40:52.618 --> 40:55.129
Decidedly non-boyfriend people.

40:55.132 --> 40:57.087
Never mind.

41:00.741 --> 41:03.093
Either stop staring at me
like a midway attraction,

41:03.095 --> 41:05.095
or pony-up five bucks for admission.

41:05.097 --> 41:06.930
Sorry, that's rude.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.933
OK. Here's to you,

41:09.935 --> 41:12.298
who saved my life.

41:12.301 --> 41:14.969
Who... happens to be a...

41:16.241 --> 41:17.981
Say it.

41:17.984 --> 41:20.377
A r... revenant.

41:20.379 --> 41:22.112
God, that's so weird!

41:23.282 --> 41:25.315
You're just such an awesome person.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.953
So, you gonna give me a head start?

41:31.223 --> 41:33.189
Before you tell Wynonna about me.

41:33.191 --> 41:35.125
Oh, no, I don't...

41:36.461 --> 41:38.495
I'm not going to.

41:38.497 --> 41:41.031
Because then I'd have
to tell her about me.

41:41.033 --> 41:43.460
What, that you're annoyingly sweet?

41:43.463 --> 41:45.763
I think I'm half revenant.

41:46.753 --> 41:48.853
Wow, that's the first time I've said it

41:48.856 --> 41:52.241
out loud to... anyone.

41:52.244 --> 41:54.277
Even Nicole?

41:56.145 --> 41:58.315
Oh, God! Nicole...

41:59.918 --> 42:02.218
Ugh, that text was so nasty.

42:02.220 --> 42:04.354
She's going to need some space.

42:04.356 --> 42:06.356
Screw space. Look, you need to get up

42:06.358 --> 42:09.059
in her face and make
things right. I gave a guy

42:09.061 --> 42:11.127
space once. Took up
with his best friend.

42:11.129 --> 42:13.383
And that friend was
on Wyatt's shit-list.

42:14.351 --> 42:16.762
Yeah. Worst second date ever.

42:18.791 --> 42:21.191
Do you think she's up yet?

42:21.194 --> 42:24.734
Ms. Pleat-in-her-pants is probably
doing a sun salutation as we speak.

42:26.178 --> 42:28.278
But she'll open the door for you.

42:28.280 --> 42:29.679
No matter what time.

42:34.286 --> 42:35.687
Waves?
