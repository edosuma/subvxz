32:17.316 --> 32:20.723
You get more out of it.

32:23.061 --> 32:28.137
♪ Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo... ♪

32:31.578 --> 32:34.585
Too bad your luck
isn't as good as your eyesight,

32:34.618 --> 32:36.555
because you were right.

32:36.588 --> 32:39.160
There was someone
in my back seat, but...

32:39.193 --> 32:40.429
he wasn't a killer,

32:40.462 --> 32:42.399
he was a victim.

32:42.432 --> 32:44.571
My sixth, to be exact.

32:44.604 --> 32:47.577
The media hasn't caught up yet,
but that's okay,

32:47.610 --> 32:49.715
'cause some people
just aren't missed.

32:49.748 --> 32:52.554
I'm not doing this
for the likes,

32:52.587 --> 32:54.791
I am doing this
as a public service.

32:54.824 --> 32:58.666
I am ridding the world
of entitled assholes

32:58.699 --> 33:00.737
who think they're all that.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.807
And now, they're all buried
in my wine cellar,

33:02.840 --> 33:07.349
including that waste of space
that you saw in my back seat.

33:07.382 --> 33:09.287
Although he was a real prize.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.757
Textbook misogynist.

33:10.790 --> 33:12.561
From the bottom
of my heart, Cowboy,

33:12.594 --> 33:14.698
there is just one thing
I want from you.

33:14.731 --> 33:17.604
-Just one thing.
-Yeah. Here it comes.

33:17.637 --> 33:20.475
Get the fuck out of my car.

33:20.509 --> 33:23.816
-Fuck you, then.
-MARCI: Dihydroetorphine.

33:23.849 --> 33:27.089
This, vets use to paralyze
large animals.

33:27.122 --> 33:30.362
-(handle clicks)
-What the fuck is wrong
with this thing?

33:30.395 --> 33:32.433
I must have the child lock on.

33:32.466 --> 33:34.504
Although it can be tricky
at times,

33:34.537 --> 33:35.740
it's hard to get
the right exact dose,

33:35.773 --> 33:37.510
because you have to do it
in the neck

33:37.543 --> 33:39.748
so it goes
straight to the brain.

33:39.781 --> 33:42.787
Even then, sometimes it works
fast, sometimes it works slow.

33:42.820 --> 33:45.660
Sometimes, it doesn't seem
to work at all.

33:45.693 --> 33:49.166
Can you just stay the fuck down?

33:50.235 --> 33:53.208
And then...

33:53.241 --> 33:54.744
you show up.

33:56.380 --> 33:58.451
And now I've got a problem,

33:58.484 --> 33:59.755
because I have this guy

33:59.788 --> 34:02.359
-in my back seat...
-(horn honking)

34:02.392 --> 34:03.663
Stay the fuck down

34:03.696 --> 34:05.667
or I'll kill you in this car
right fucking now.

34:05.700 --> 34:08.405
...and I've a Good Samaritan
flashing his lights,

34:08.438 --> 34:11.076
-ramming me.
-(loud thud)

34:12.446 --> 34:13.816
(muffled shout)

34:13.849 --> 34:18.257
By the way, you caused
$700 damage to my car.

34:19.360 --> 34:21.765
(muffled scream)

34:24.771 --> 34:26.542
But that's besides the point.

34:26.575 --> 34:30.783
The point is,
I got my shit together.

34:31.785 --> 34:33.556
You almost ruined everything.

34:33.589 --> 34:36.361
You almost ruined
the one reason I have

34:36.394 --> 34:40.101
for being on this Earth...

34:42.807 --> 34:47.717
...the species of you
that made my life

34:47.750 --> 34:52.225
an endless shit-fest.

35:00.175 --> 35:05.419
Do you know what it's like
going through high school

35:05.452 --> 35:08.157
with this on your face?

35:08.759 --> 35:10.530
And there were so many people,

35:10.563 --> 35:13.468
so many people
that made fun of me.

35:13.502 --> 35:16.407
And who joined in?

35:16.440 --> 35:19.548
People like you.

35:19.581 --> 35:20.750
Winners.

35:20.783 --> 35:24.691
Top of the food chain
type of people.

35:24.724 --> 35:29.166
You led the charge
and you kept me in hell.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.343
WINOWSKI:
Uh-uh.

35:34.376 --> 35:36.915
(muffled grunting)

35:40.523 --> 35:42.359
(muffled grunting)

35:42.392 --> 35:44.564
No, no, no, no.

35:44.597 --> 35:47.937
(screams)

35:53.615 --> 35:55.753
You want to know
how I got out of it?

35:55.786 --> 35:58.526
How I came out
on the other side?

35:58.559 --> 36:01.732
'Cause I found the right partner

36:01.765 --> 36:06.941
who always was there for me,
knew exactly how I felt.

36:08.010 --> 36:14.222
It's... the most important
thing, it's everything.

36:16.561 --> 36:19.299
(whimpering)

36:21.705 --> 36:24.309
(muffled shout)

36:26.548 --> 36:27.884
Nice balance.

36:27.917 --> 36:30.790
A good knife should feel like
an extension of your hand.

36:30.823 --> 36:33.863
Anyways, you're in luck tonight,
Mr. Good Samaritan.

36:33.896 --> 36:37.737
because usually,
I'd work on you for a while,

36:37.770 --> 36:40.008
but my throat hurts,
thanks to you,

36:40.041 --> 36:42.747
so I'm just gonna skip
right to the end.

36:42.780 --> 36:45.018
Plus, it's my husband's job
to bury you,

36:45.051 --> 36:48.925
and he's earned himself
an early night.

36:55.739 --> 36:58.277
This is wrong.

37:00.749 --> 37:03.254
This is all wrong.

37:06.595 --> 37:07.897
It's just been...

37:07.930 --> 37:11.403
It's been wrong for a while.

37:13.675 --> 37:15.278
Don't go anywhere.

37:17.082 --> 37:19.855
CHAZ:
That was fast.
I'll be right down.

37:19.888 --> 37:21.725
You're gonna have to start
thinking about using

37:21.758 --> 37:22.794
the backyard, you know,
'cause the cellar's

37:22.827 --> 37:24.497
getting pretty full.

37:24.898 --> 37:27.970
Chaz, I-I want to start over.

37:30.475 --> 37:32.614
Start over?

37:32.647 --> 37:34.316
I'm serious.

37:34.349 --> 37:38.692
I don't, I don't want to do this
anymore without you.

37:38.725 --> 37:40.730
I want you to come with me,

37:40.763 --> 37:44.704
I want you to do more
than just bury the bodies.

37:44.737 --> 37:47.543
That's a big step.

37:48.579 --> 37:51.585
I know. It's okay.

37:51.618 --> 37:53.756
I can help you.

37:53.789 --> 37:56.862
And it can be something
we can share.

37:56.895 --> 38:00.067
-How can I say no?
-(laughs softly)

38:01.938 --> 38:06.480
And I think I know the perfect
person to start with.

38:17.536 --> 38:19.540
(muffled screams)

38:28.625 --> 38:29.761
Okay.

38:29.794 --> 38:32.600
Let's do this.

38:32.633 --> 38:34.771
I love you.

38:34.804 --> 38:36.642
-I love you, too.
-(muffled scream)

38:36.675 --> 38:39.045
(muffled screaming)
