you're probably
due an upgrade, huh?

Here you are.

-No need to thank me!
-He doesn't talk. Jude!

00:28.403 --> 00:30.697
-Jude, I said don't run off!
-Hey,
can I help you with that?

Hey, you've got
your hands full, huh?

00:34.158 --> 00:35.368
Good plan.

00:35.452 --> 00:36.953
-You should kick off.
-I did.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.289
The guy at the office thought
the walk would do me good.

00:39.372 --> 00:43.918
-Arsehole.
-Dan? My flatmate,
massive arsehole.

about our hot date?
-Um...

02:25.311 --> 02:27.605
You were going to help me find
the staff records, remember?

02:28.606 --> 02:30.066
Well, I'm needed here. I mean,

02:30.150 --> 02:32.193
you think just
anyone can pour nuts
into a bowl?

02:32.277 --> 02:34.487
You don't know
where to start, do you?

If you hadn't have
closed down my blog,
my only point of contact...

02:37.157 --> 02:39.117
That bald man that
I keep seeing in my visions,

02:39.200 --> 02:41.369
I think he used to work here
in the hospital days.

02:41.453 --> 02:44.581
Max, I know that
he's done something
awful to Eve.

02:44.664 --> 02:48.209
It's really nice
when you call in
to talk about child murder.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.379
I found something.

02:51.463 --> 02:55.425
This guy, local historical
society, reckons he's got
old staff photos.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.845
-He's sending them through.
-Thanks, Max.

02:58.928 --> 03:01.348
Why do you put up with me?

03:01.431 --> 03:05.226
I don't know.
If you find out,
please let me know.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.828
I've asked you nicely now.

Jude!

03:28.583 --> 03:31.336
-You okay?
-Who's that boy?

03:31.419 --> 03:35.173
Scott and Jude.
They've just moved in.
He doesn't talk. Why?

03:36.216 --> 03:37.717
Can I get the bill, Max?

03:39.010 --> 03:40.303

I'll talk to you later, okay?

03:53.983 --> 03:56.736
Actually, I'm going to go,
I don't feel great.

03:57.987 --> 04:00.031
Come on, we're leaving.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.784
I knew moving him in with me
was a bad idea.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.036
-So how come you...
-Our mum died.

-You tell me.
-Well, I can't keep
doing this every day

04:45.535 --> 04:48.204
so just let's forget about
what happened, okay?

04:48.288 --> 04:49.956
You think I don't
see what's going on?

04:50.038 --> 04:52.000
-What?
-You and him.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.295
Max? (SCOFFING)

04:58.340 --> 05:01.051
That night we had.
Was that about screwing with
his head or mine?

05:01.134 --> 05:04.429
Thank you for reminding me
why I think
you're such a prick.

05:04.512 --> 05:07.640
Look, I can't forget about it.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.435
Ellie, come on,
there's no way
you're shutting me out

05:10.518 --> 05:13.063
because I went with some girl.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.107
Really, you don't want to get
mixed up with me.

05:34.834 --> 05:38.338

-I have to finish this.

-Sorry. He's in a meeting.
-Kiera...

06:21.965 --> 06:25.552
I thought you and her dad
were supposed to be friends?

06:25.635 --> 06:30.348
It's funny, though,
because Kate goes and suddenly
she's all over you.

06:30.432 --> 06:33.268
-I wonder why?
-Hey, you are that
far away from a slap.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.936
I know what she's like.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.813
She's getting
her claws into you
for your money.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.940
-The money you built
up for your family.
-Enough!

06:39.024 --> 06:40.650
I know you want a bit of fun,
but why her?

06:40.734 --> 06:43.236
That's not what it is.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.031
She's good for me.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.033
Really?

06:49.950 --> 06:51.786
She'll be waiting.

-Cheers, man.

I think he's
beginning to suspect.

You get that, right?

'cause every other haunting
has been so ordinary.

Please, it wasn't me.

Jude know the names of staff
members from 1958?

guidelines, pushed through
safe limits, yeah?

who survived his experiments

might have ended
up in the asylum.

could be happening.

the revenant might recognize
another kid just like him.

want to hurt Scott?

I'll be honest.
I thought, "He's loaded.
I'll have some of that."

36:19.387 --> 36:21.639
That's why you work
here for six months
and say nothing.

36:21.723 --> 36:24.476
You'd have had me out of here
before I
finished the sentence.

36:25.352 --> 36:26.561
Now...

36:27.520 --> 36:28.980
you need me.

36:29.814 --> 36:31.107
You cocky little shit.

36:31.191 --> 36:33.735
And that's another way
you know I'm yours.

36:33.818 --> 36:35.028
What do you want?

36:35.111 --> 36:38.448
I grew up with nothing.
Less than nothing.

36:38.531 --> 36:41.201
My mum worked two jobs
and there were
four kids to support.

36:41.284 --> 36:43.953
What do you want?

36:44.037 --> 36:47.832
Like I said, you're loaded.
And I want my share.

36:47.916 --> 36:51.002
I want to be a part of this
but only when I've earned it.

36:52.170 --> 36:54.839
I want you to be my dad.

36:57.884 --> 37:00.804
Well,
you haven't earned it yet.

37:06.601 --> 37:08.311
SCOTT: Jude!
MAX: Jude!

37:09.479 --> 37:11.314
ELLIE: Jude?
MAX: Jude!

37:13.775 --> 37:16.236
-Jude!
-Jude!

37:16.319 --> 37:18.154
SCOTT: Jude, stop!

37:20.281 --> 37:21.908
-Wait, Jude!
-Wait, there's lightning.

37:21.991 --> 37:23.827
It's not safe out there!

37:23.910 --> 37:26.413
There's a little boy in there.
The same little boy!

37:26.496 --> 37:28.123
-No, but Ellie...
-He's there!

37:35.463 --> 37:37.882
(CHANTING)

37:39.551 --> 37:42.095
-Go inside and get help!
-I am the help!

37:42.178 --> 37:43.847
-(CHANTING CONTINUES)
-Jude!

37:46.683 --> 37:47.767
Jude!

37:48.685 --> 37:49.853
Jude!

37:51.771 --> 37:53.314
My God!

37:53.398 --> 37:57.027
-Scott, get back!
-Oh, my God.

37:57.110 --> 37:59.529
-I can't just leave him.
-He's going to
kill you, Scott!

37:59.612 --> 38:01.031
Give me my brother back.

38:01.114 --> 38:02.532
(CHANTING IN LATIN)

38:06.411 --> 38:08.747
(PRIEST GIVING LAST RITES)

38:11.291 --> 38:13.835
(CHANTING CONTINUES)

38:13.918 --> 38:16.296
He died from the ECT!

38:18.381 --> 38:20.383
He's just a kid.
Leave him alone!

38:21.468 --> 38:22.886
Give me my brother back!

38:22.969 --> 38:24.679
Scott, talk to Jude!

38:24.763 --> 38:26.348
Not the spirit. Jude.

38:29.059 --> 38:31.144
Jude...

38:31.227 --> 38:35.273
-I know you can hear me.
-Scott,
tell him you want him back.

38:35.357 --> 38:39.861
I'll never,
ever send you away.
All we've got is each other.

38:39.944 --> 38:42.614
I resented being with you.
And I know that was wrong.

38:44.115 --> 38:45.241
I'm sorry.

38:47.369 --> 38:49.245
I love you.

38:54.918 --> 38:56.753
SCOTT: I love you.

39:03.510 --> 39:05.261
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

39:12.811 --> 39:15.563
Here you go, mate.
Let's get you dried off.

39:15.647 --> 39:18.191
I'll be there for
you and the baby.

39:19.401 --> 39:21.236
Whatever Dan decides.

39:22.529 --> 39:23.905
But if he doesn't
stick by you...

39:23.988 --> 39:27.867
I don't know if
I'm going to keep it.

39:27.951 --> 39:31.830
Well, how can I bring a baby
into this world
who could be like me?

39:33.248 --> 39:35.250
It's not such
a bad thing, is it?

39:39.421 --> 39:43.508
The ghost is still
in the building, it could come
back at any time.

39:43.591 --> 39:45.427
I have to live with that.

40:08.658 --> 40:12.162
I hope he appreciates you
protecting him.

40:12.245 --> 40:15.457
I hope he
doesn't leave you out
in the cold, too.

40:45.320 --> 40:46.321
(SNIFFS)

41:32.117 --> 41:33.284
Eve?

41:42.460 --> 41:44.462
These people hurt you,
didn't they?

41:48.091 --> 41:50.343
Tell me what they did, Eve.

41:51.344 --> 41:52.512
Tell me.

41:53.722 --> 41:55.515
(SCREAMING)

42:09.654 --> 42:10.864
(GASPS)

42:17.662 --> 42:18.830
It's okay.

42:19.748 --> 42:22.208
Ellie? It's okay.

42:23.168 --> 42:24.502
It's okay.
