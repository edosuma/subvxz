MOVE IT OUT.

00:29.190 --> 00:31.124
LISTEN, FRANKS...

00:33.830 --> 00:35.752
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
NOT TO GET SHOT.

00:35.800 --> 00:39.395
MAKE THE WRONG MOVE,
YOU LOSE THAT RIGHT.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.396
PUT DOWN THE BOMB.

00:51.450 --> 00:53.418
GOOD MOVE.

00:53.450 --> 00:54.815
[reporters chattering]

00:54.850 --> 00:57.648
WE RECENTLY OBTAINED
INTELLIGENCE OF A BOMB PLOT

00:57.690 --> 00:59.487
BY AN ANTIGOVERNMENT RADICAL.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.227
HIS INTENDED TARGET
WAS THIS VERY BUILDING.

01:02.260 --> 01:04.649
WE OWE THE SUCCESS
OF THIS INVESTIGATION

01:04.690 --> 01:08.524
AND, INDEED, OUR VERY LIVES
TO SERGEANT HENRY SPENCER.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.528
[applause]
WELL DONE.

01:10.570 --> 01:13.539
SERGEANT SPENCER, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS?

01:13.570 --> 01:15.128
UH, NO.
NO, THANKS, CHIEF.

01:15.170 --> 01:17.809
A POLICE OFFICER DOESN'T
DESERVE ANY SPECIAL ATTENTION

01:17.840 --> 01:19.671
FOR JUST DOIN' HIS JOB.

01:24.350 --> 01:26.545
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SENSE
THE ELECTRICITY IN THE ROOM.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.548
THAT'S BECAUSE OUR ARRIVAL
USUALLY SIGNALS

01:28.580 --> 01:30.218
THAT A HUGE CASE
IS GOING DOWN.

01:30.250 --> 01:31.285
STEP IN HERE PLEASE,
GENTLEMEN.

01:31.320 --> 01:32.514
THAT'S THE CHIEF.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.516
SHE LIKES THE TWO OF US
VERY MUCH.

01:34.560 --> 01:37.154
I'M SORRY, YOU ARE?

01:37.190 --> 01:38.487
OH, SORRY, CHIEF.

01:38.530 --> 01:41.124
I GOT ROPED INTO DOING A SILLY
INTERVIEW WITH THE INDEPENDENT.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.866
THEY'VE BEEN CALLING
AND BEGGING FOR WEEKS,

01:42.900 --> 01:44.424
AND I FINALLY RELENTED.

01:44.470 --> 01:45.767
YOU CALLED ME.

01:45.800 --> 01:49.406
AND YOU CALLED ME BACK.
WHICH MEANS WE'RE BOTH RIGHT.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.862
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT
YOU GOT YOUR COVER STORY.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.231
ACTUALLY, IT'S PAGE 64.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.531
REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW
YOU FOLD IT, DOESN'T IT?

01:54.580 --> 01:56.775
SHE CAN'T BE IN HERE,
SO GET HER THE HELL OUT.

01:58.250 --> 02:00.138
UH, COME TO THINK OF IT,

02:00.180 --> 02:01.716
I THINK YOU'LL PROBABLY
GET A BETTER SHOT HERE

02:01.750 --> 02:02.910
THROUGH THIS WINDOW.

02:02.950 --> 02:05.145
NOW, TRY TO CATCH ME
WITH A GOOD EXPRESSION,

02:05.190 --> 02:06.851
PREFERABLY
WITH THIS EYEBROW RAISED...

02:06.890 --> 02:08.551
LIKE SO.

02:08.590 --> 02:10.751
OR MY SERIOUS FACE.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.726
BEST-CASE SCENARIO,

02:14.760 --> 02:17.297
SNAP A SHOT WHEN
MY SIGNATURE LOOK COMES UP.

02:17.330 --> 02:18.888
I CALL IT
SENOR GOTCHA!

02:18.930 --> 02:20.363
OH!

02:20.400 --> 02:22.231
HOW WILL I KNOW
WHAT THAT IS?

02:22.270 --> 02:23.305

I NEED YOU...HERE.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.741
THANK YOU.

02:33.950 --> 02:35.178
CHIEF, WHAT'S UP?

02:35.220 --> 02:37.541
MR. SPENCER,

02:41.520 --> 02:42.726
ARE YOU OKAY?

02:42.760 --> 02:44.250
RIGHT AS RAIN.

02:45.390 --> 02:46.891
LONG STORY SHORT,

02:46.930 --> 02:50.229
A HANDFUL OF CONVICTIONS,
SOME OF THEM DECADES OLD,

02:50.270 --> 02:52.329
HAVE BEEN RECENTLY
CALLED INTO QUESTION.

02:52.370 --> 02:54.736
UN FORTU NATELY,
THE BIGGEST ONE

02:54.770 --> 02:56.965
WAS A SANTA BARBARA

02:57.010 --> 02:58.500
SO WE'RE REOPENING
THE CASE

02:58.540 --> 02:59.973
AND LAUNCHING
A NEW INVESTIGATION.

03:00.010 --> 03:01.773
NOW WE'RE HIRING Y--

[camera shutter clicking]

03:02.750 --> 03:05.275
YOU TO PROVIDE US
WITH ANY PSYCHIC LEADS

03:05.310 --> 03:06.242
THAT YOU MAY HAVE.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.212
NOW, NORMALLY,

03:07.250 --> 03:09.980
WE DON'T DEVOTE
DEPARTMENT RESOURCES TO THIS,

03:10.020 --> 03:12.955
BUT THESE ARE
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

03:12.990 --> 03:15.686
OH, COULD YOU DO
THE HANDOFF AGAIN, CHIEF?

03:18.430 --> 03:20.421
THAN KS.

03:23.870 --> 03:24.996
OH, NO.

03:25.030 --> 03:25.997
WHAT IS IT?

03:26.030 --> 03:29.261
IT'S MY DAD'S BIGGEST CASE.

[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

03:39.680 --> 03:44.515
*

03:44.550 --> 03:47.986
* IN BETWEEN THE LINES
THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY *

03:48.020 --> 03:51.421
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

03:51.460 --> 03:54.623
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT
THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG *

03:54.660 --> 03:58.323
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG? *

03:59.670 --> 04:00.637
* YOU'D RATHER RUN

04:00.670 --> 04:03.230
* WHEN YOU CAN'T CRAWL

04:04.840 --> 04:07.308
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

THE TRUTH *

* I KNOW YOU KNOW

04:10.980 --> 04:12.049
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

04:12.080 --> 04:14.275
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

* LEARN HOW TO BEND

IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING,
MR. SPENCER,

04:25.990 --> 04:27.423
THAT YOUR FATHER
IS IN NO WAY

04:27.460 --> 04:29.325
TO PARTICIPATE
IN THIS INVESTIGATION.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.462
HE'S NO LONGER
ON THE FORCE,

04:30.500 --> 04:32.639
AND HIS MEDDLING COULD
COMPROMISE THE CASE IN COURT.

04:32.670 --> 04:33.739
DO I MAKE MYSELF
CLEAR?

04:33.770 --> 04:34.930
YES, YOU DO, CHIEF.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.961
WHAT ISN'T CLEAR
IS WHY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY,

04:37.010 --> 04:38.363
"IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING,"

04:38.410 --> 04:39.968
YET STILL FEEL COMPELLED
TO SAY THE THING

04:40.010 --> 04:41.409
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO
WITHOUT SAYING.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.646
DOESN'T THAT BOTHER YOU?

04:42.680 --> 04:45.444
NO. AND FRANKLY,
I COULD CARE LESS.

04:45.480 --> 04:46.913
NOW, THAT'S THE ONE
THAT BOTHERS ME.

04:46.950 --> 04:48.679
WHY DO PEOPLE SAY,
"I COULD CARE LESS"

04:48.720 --> 04:50.517
WHEN THEY REALLY MEAN
"I COULDN'T CARE LESS"?

04:50.550 --> 04:54.418
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
HOW TO PROPERLY SAY THIS:

04:54.460 --> 04:56.325
IF YOU SHARE ANY OFFICIAL
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CASE

04:56.360 --> 05:00.319
WITH YOUR FATHER OR LET HIM
ANYWHERE NEAR ANY NEW EVIDENCE,

05:00.360 --> 05:02.328
THEN THE TWO OF YOU
WILL HAVE TO FIND

05:02.370 --> 05:04.326
ANOTHER POLICE DEPARTMENT
TO WORK FOR.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.338

SEE TO IT

ELOCUTED.

WHEN HE SEES THIS.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.382
WE HAVE TO GO INTO
STEALTH MODE.

NO TAKING HIS CALLS.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.050
THIS WON'T HIT THE NEWS
TILL TOMORROW.

05:28.090 --> 05:30.024

A 24-HOUR HEAD START.

I KNOW CHIEF VICK JUST GAVE YOU
THE NEW FRANKS CASE.

05:45.810 --> 05:47.129
SO WHY DON'T YOU
LET ME TAKE A LOOK

05:47.180 --> 05:48.704
AT WHAT YOU'RE HIDING
IN THAT LITTLE FOLDER THERE

05:48.740 --> 05:50.105
SO I CAN GET MOVING ON THIS?

05:50.150 --> 05:52.516
OKAY, FINE, YOU'RE RIGHT.
CHIEF VICK DID JUST HIRE US.

05:52.550 --> 05:53.710
BUT THERE IS NO WAY
NOPE.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.479
THAT I'M SHOWING YOU
WHAT'S IN THIS FOLDER.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.612
YOU'RE LUCKY I'M EVEN
ASKING YOU, SHAWN.

05:56.650 --> 05:57.787
I COULD DO THIS
THE SIMPLE WAY.

05:57.820 --> 05:59.048
I COULD GRAB IT FROM YOU,

05:59.090 --> 06:00.648
CLEAN UP ANY EVIDENCE
OF A STRUGGLE

06:00.690 --> 06:02.555
BEFORE YOU AND YOUR LITTLE
FRIEND HERE KNEW WHAT HIT YOU.

06:02.590 --> 06:04.023
IN SOME STATES,
THAT'S CALLED CHILD ABUSE.

06:04.060 --> 06:05.379
I THINK ALL OF THEM.

06:05.430 --> 06:06.590
LOOK, CHIEF VICK
MADE IT VERY CLEAR

06:06.630 --> 06:08.029
THAT YOU, SPECIFICALLY,

06:08.060 --> 06:10.096
WERE TO COME NOWHERE
NEAR THIS CASE.

06:10.130 --> 06:11.893
THIS SHOULDN'T EVEN
BE A CASE, SHAWN.

06:11.930 --> 06:13.636
THE SON OF A BITCH
WAS LET OUT

06:13.670 --> 06:15.695
ON SOME MICROCRAP PROBLEM
WITH MY SEARCH WARRANT.

06:15.740 --> 06:17.537
EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES.

06:17.570 --> 06:19.709
THERE WAS NO MISTAKE!

WHOA.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.546
(Henry)
IT WAS THE '705.
WE DID WHAT WE HAD TO DO.

06:26.580 --> 06:28.639
BUT ONLY WHEN WE KNEW
WE HAD THE RIGHT GUY,

06:28.680 --> 06:30.113
AND I GOT THE RIGHT GUY.

06:30.150 --> 06:31.447
PERIOD.

06:31.490 --> 06:34.414
OKAY.
YOU GOT THE RIGHT GUY.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.587
STILL DOESN'T MEAN
I'M GONNA PUT YOU ON THIS CASE.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.621
NOR WOULD I EVEN WANT TO.

06:38.660 --> 06:40.890
DAD, YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW
GUS AND I ROLL--GUS, TELL HIM.

06:40.930 --> 06:42.124
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:42.160 --> 06:43.593
YOU GO AHEAD AND HANDLE
THIS HALF-ASSED

06:43.630 --> 06:44.767
LIKE YOU DO EVERYTHING ELSE.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.633
BUT YOU BEAR THIS IN MIND.

06:47.670 --> 06:50.639
THIS CASE IS IMPORTANT TO A LOT
OF PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE DIED

06:50.670 --> 06:52.706
IF HE HAD BLOWN UP
OUR HEADQUARTERS.

06:56.140 --> 06:58.643
IT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT
TO THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS TOO.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.748
WHOA.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.051
NEVER SEEN MY DAD
BEG BEFORE.

07:10.090 --> 07:11.728
THAT'S HOW HE BEGS?

07:11.760 --> 07:13.819
HE'S CLEARLY
NOT GONNA LET THIS GO.

07:13.860 --> 07:14.622
SO LOOK, IF WE'RE GONNA

07:14.660 --> 07:16.594
INVESTIGATE THIS THING
UNDISTURBED,

07:16.630 --> 07:18.598
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO JUMP
AHEAD A FEW STEPS,

07:18.630 --> 07:20.791
FILL IN THE BLANKS
WHEN WE'RE DONE.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.568
WE SHOULD GO STRAIGHT
TO THE D.A.'S OFFICE.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.739
BEAT YOU BY EIGHT MINUTES.

07:34.780 --> 07:36.042
NOT TOO EMBARRASSING.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.581
DAD, I KNEW
YOU WOULD COME

07:37.620 --> 07:39.713
AND TRY TO INVESTIGATE
THIS ON YOUR OWN.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.058
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW DANGEROUS THIS IS?

07:42.090 --> 07:43.819
WHY? I'M A TAX PAYING,
VOTING CITIZEN.

07:43.860 --> 07:46.226
THEREFORE, I HAVE A RIGHT TO
SPEAK TO ANY ELECTED OFFICIAL,

07:46.260 --> 07:47.591
SUCH AS THE D.A., I PLEASE.

07:47.630 --> 07:49.791
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A...

07:49.830 --> 07:51.866
TAX PAYING, VOTING CITIZEN,
THOUGH, DO YOU?

07:51.900 --> 07:53.492
MAY I HELP YOU?

07:53.540 --> 07:56.168
YES. MY NAME
IS SHAWN SPENCER.

I AM THE HEAD PSYCHIC

08:00.110 --> 08:01.998
YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S HIS
PARTNER, METHUSELAH HONEYSUCKLE,

08:02.040 --> 08:03.576
WHICH MAKES ME
OLD SCRATCH JOHNSON.

08:03.610 --> 08:04.941
LISTEN,
WE NEED TO SEE COPIES

08:04.980 --> 08:06.572

08:06.620 --> 08:08.508
FOR THE EUGENE FRANKS CASE.

08:08.550 --> 08:10.040
I'M NOT SURE
I CAN RELEASE THOSE.

08:18.660 --> 08:20.025
AH, AH, AH.

08:20.060 --> 08:23.962
I'M GETTING A VERY SOFT,
CUDDLY VIBE HERE.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.968
IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU AND YOUR WIFE ARE--

08:26.000 --> 08:27.661
YEAH, YEAH, THEY'RE
GONNA HAVE ANOTHER KID.

08:27.700 --> 08:30.567
IT'S A BOY.
CONGRATULATIONS.

08:30.610 --> 08:31.907
DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR.

08:31.940 --> 08:33.703
DON'T CALL IT SHAWN.
PROBLEMS.

08:33.740 --> 08:35.139
MORE IMPORTANTLY,

08:35.180 --> 08:37.603
ACCORDING TO THE FREEDOM
OF INFORMATION ACT,

08:37.650 --> 08:39.299
THOSE TRANSCRIPTS ARE NOW

GOOD POINT.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.589
I'LL HAVE OUR RECORDS
DEPARTMENT MAKE COPIES.

08:44.620 --> 08:46.759
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

08:46.790 --> 08:48.212
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE REALLY
PUTTING A DAMPER

08:48.260 --> 08:49.727
ON THE PROCEEDINGS HERE.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.648
YOU CALL IT A DAMPER.
I CALL IT WORKING.

08:51.690 --> 08:54.090
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
COME HERE.

08:54.130 --> 08:55.688
ALL RIGHT, I NEED YOU
TO HEAR ME, OKAY?

08:55.730 --> 08:58.790
IF YOU INSIST ON STAYING
INVOLVED IN THIS CASE,

08:58.830 --> 09:00.263
THEN THERE ARE
GOING TO BE RULES.

09:00.300 --> 09:02.734
I WAS HIRED
BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

09:02.770 --> 09:04.135
THEREFORE,
IT IS MY ASS ON THE LINE,

09:04.170 --> 09:05.808
AND THOSE RULES
WILL BE MADE BY ME.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.068
[lowers voice]
YOU ARE NO LONGER A COP.

09:07.110 --> 09:08.839
AND UNLESS YOU PLAN
ON GOING BACK TO THE ACADEMY

09:08.880 --> 09:11.098
AND CLIMBING THE HIGH WALL
AND DOING THE OBSTACLE COURSE

09:11.150 --> 09:12.947
WHERE YOU SHOOT THE BAD GUYS,

09:12.980 --> 09:14.117
BUT NOT THE OLD LADY
WITH THE SACK

09:14.150 --> 09:16.641
OR THE BLIND GUY WITH THE CANE
OR THE CUTE LITTLE SQUIRREL

09:16.690 --> 09:18.749
WITH THE BUSHY TAIL
AND THE BIG, FAT NUT...

09:18.790 --> 09:19.779
THAT STARTED OFF WELL.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.287
IT REALLY FELL APART
AT THE END.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.823
YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD A NAME
FOR THE WALL OR SOMETHING.

09:23.860 --> 09:25.782
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT
YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO ME,

09:25.830 --> 09:27.297
IS WHAT I'M SAYING.

09:27.330 --> 09:30.788
ALL RIGHT, SHAWN.
POINT TAKEN.

09:30.830 --> 09:32.730
YOU GOT A DEAL.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.161
THAT MEANS
YOU'RE WORKIN' FOR ME NOW.

09:39.210 --> 09:40.837
WHY DON'T YOU GRAB
SOME COFFEE FOR US?

09:40.880 --> 09:41.835
BLACK.
TWO SUGARS.

09:41.880 --> 09:42.869
TWO SUGARS.

09:46.380 --> 09:48.348
I DON'T UNDERSTAND--YOU GUYS
HAD TO HANDWRITE EVERYTHING?

09:48.380 --> 09:49.916
WHAT IF YOU NEEDED
MULTIPLE COPIES?

09:49.950 --> 09:51.679
WELL, WE HAD ONE COMPUTER,

09:51.720 --> 09:53.256
BUT IT TOOK UP
THE ENTIRE SECOND FLOOR.

09:53.290 --> 09:56.623
GENERALLY, WE WOULD USE
THE MIMEO MACHINE.

09:56.660 --> 09:58.651
(Shawn)
HOW LONG DID THAT TAKE,
A WEEK?

09:58.690 --> 10:00.658
YOU KNOW, ALL THE HIGH-TECH
FANCY GADGETS THEY USE TODAY

10:00.700 --> 10:02.622
DON'T SOLVE CRIMES
ANY BETTER THAN WE DID.

10:02.670 --> 10:03.466
A GOOD DETECTIVE IS BORN

10:03.500 --> 10:05.388
WITH ALL THE TOOLS
HE NEEDS RIGHT HERE.

10:05.430 --> 10:06.692
[telephone rings]

10:09.140 --> 10:13.679
HELLO. CHIEF,
WHAT'S THE GOOD W--

10:13.710 --> 10:16.099
MY DAD,
DOWN AT THE D.A.'S OFFICE?

10:16.140 --> 10:19.769
NO, I-I DON'T THINK SO.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.641
AH, I THINK I CAN
CLEAR THIS UP FOR YA, CHIEF.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.715
THAT WASN'T MY DAD.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.418
THAT WAS PHIL COLLINS.

10:28.460 --> 10:31.122
YEAH, WE SAW PHIL
DOWN AT THE COURTHOUSE.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.651
MY DAD GETS MISTAKEN
FOR HIM ALL THE TIME.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.258
[whispers]
I DON'T LOOK--SHAWN--
SHH!

10:35.300 --> 10:37.666
I DON'T LOOK ANYTHING
LIKE PHIL COLLINS.
[Shawn and Gus shushing]

10:37.700 --> 10:40.339
NO, I'M--I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN
ABOUT THIS, CHIEF.

10:40.370 --> 10:43.828
HE WAS HUMMING INVISIBLE TOUCH,
IF THAT HELPS YOU.

10:43.870 --> 10:45.167
NO.

10:45.210 --> 10:46.734
I-I WASN'T AWARE

10:46.780 --> 10:50.341
THAT PHIL COLLINS
LIVES IN SWITZERLAND.

10:50.380 --> 10:52.712
HOW DOES SHE KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT PHIL COLLINS?

10:52.750 --> 10:53.717
I DON'T KNOW.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.718
YES. I DO HEAR YOU.

10:55.750 --> 10:58.412
I WILL MAKE SURE
HE STAYS AWAY.

11:00.760 --> 11:01.749
LOVE YOU TOO.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.155
DO YOU SEE?
DO YOU SEE?

11:05.190 --> 11:07.055
WE HAVE TO BE
MORE CAREFUL.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.091
OKAY, HOTSHOT.
ALL RIGHT, I GET IT.

11:09.130 --> 11:11.826
TELL ME WHAT YOU CAN
GLEAN FROM THIS.

11:11.870 --> 11:13.735
YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT I CAN GLEAN?

11:13.770 --> 11:14.862
(Henry)
GLEAN.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.704
THE D.A. ARRESTED AFTER ONLY
SUBMITTING THE INITIAL EVIDENCE?

11:22.750 --> 11:23.603
CORRECT -A-MUNDO.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.709
THE EVIDENCE I UNCOVERED
IN THAT DEPARTMENT

11:25.750 --> 11:26.842
WAS SO STRONG,

11:26.880 --> 11:28.916
THE D.A. DIDN'T NEED ANYTHING
ELSE TO GET A CONVICTION.

11:28.950 --> 11:30.486
BUT ALL THE EVIDENCE
IS POISONOUS FRUIT

11:30.520 --> 11:32.488
BECAUSE OF THE SEARCH WARRANT.
THIS EVIDENCE, YES.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.715
GOOD THING I GOT A DIFFERENT
WARRANT FOR THE SECOND ROUND.

11:34.760 --> 11:35.886
THE D.A. DIDN'T SUBMIT
ANY OF THAT STUFF,

11:35.920 --> 11:37.751
WHICH MEANS
WE CAN USE THAT NOW.

11:37.790 --> 11:40.156
ALL THE HIGH-TECH GADGETS
IN THE WORLD

11:40.200 --> 11:41.724
WON'T TELL YOU THAT,
WILL IT?

11:41.760 --> 11:44.194
WE GOTTA GET THE CHIEF TO LET US
INTO THE COUNTY ARCHIVES

11:44.230 --> 11:45.766
SO WE CAN TAKE A LOOK
AT THAT EVIDENCE.

11:45.800 --> 11:46.892
GUS, GIMME YOUR KEYS.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.862
THAT WOULD BE A NO.
OGLETREE'S CHECKING MY MILEAGE.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.868
WE'LL TAKE MY TRUCK.
NO, WE WON'T.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.834
THAT RAISES THE CHANCES
OF YOU BEING SEEN AGAIN.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.939
WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE
MY MOTORCYCLE.

11:55.980 --> 11:58.744
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO TRY THREESIES.

11:58.780 --> 12:01.214
WHO WANTS THE HANDLEBARS?
GUS, FEELS LIKE YOU.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.343
NO.
YEAH, THAT SHOULDN'T
DRAW ANY ATTENTION.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.414
WE'LL CAB IT.

12:04.450 --> 12:06.145
FINE.
IT'S FUNNY.

12:06.190 --> 12:08.454
IT'S USUALLY ME WHO CAN'T
SHOW MY FACE IN PUBLIC.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.788
JUST THINK, THE CONTENTS
INSIDE THESE BOXES

12:13.830 --> 12:15.195
COULD DETERMINE WHETHER
SOMEONE SPENDS

12:15.230 --> 12:16.891
THE REST OF THEIR LIFE
IN JAIL.

12:16.930 --> 12:18.090
CATCH .

12:18.130 --> 12:20.928
BETTER HOPE THEY DON'T REOPEN
THE HANDYMAN KILLER CASE.

12:20.970 --> 12:22.767
YOUR FINGERPRINTS ARE ALL OVER
THE MURDER WEAPON.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.801
[hammer thuds]
THAT'S NOT FUNNY, SHAWN!

12:24.840 --> 12:26.774
DUDE, I'M KIDDING.
IT'S NOT REALLY EVIDENCE.

12:26.810 --> 12:28.368
IT WAS JUST LYING HERE.
WELL, STOP IT.

12:28.410 --> 12:30.446
YOU KNOW I'M AFRAID
THAT BEING WRONGFULLY CONVICTED

12:30.480 --> 12:32.072
IS THE TRAGIC WAY
MY STORY ENDS.

12:32.110 --> 12:33.111
WOULD YOU TWO GIRLS
STOP BITCHING

12:33.150 --> 12:34.117
AND SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE?

12:34.150 --> 12:35.515
WHAT IS THIS STUFF?

12:35.550 --> 12:37.780
VARIOUS POSSESSIONS,
PERSONAL EFFECTS OF EUGENE'S

12:37.820 --> 12:40.050
WE FOUND
AFTER HE WAS ARRESTED.

12:40.090 --> 12:41.887
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?

12:41.920 --> 12:44.980
PAWN TICKET
MADE OUT TO EUGENE

12:45.030 --> 12:47.396
A FEW DAYS BEFORE
HE WAS ARRESTED.

12:47.430 --> 12:48.499
(Shawn)
"GOLDSTEIN'S PAWN."

12:48.530 --> 12:49.792
ANYBODY?

12:49.830 --> 12:51.821
WAIT. THAT PLACE
IS STILL AROUND.

12:51.870 --> 12:53.838
DESPERATE PEOPLE
PAWN THINGS.

12:53.870 --> 12:58.307
LET'S SEE WHAT EUGENE PAWNED
AND NEVER GOT BACK, HUH?

13:00.340 --> 13:01.432
TWO NEW CASES
JUST CAME IN.

13:01.480 --> 13:04.176
ONE INVOLVES AN INTERNATIONAL
DIAMOND SMUGGLING RING.

13:04.210 --> 13:05.871
SWEET!
BINGO!

13:05.910 --> 13:08.242
THE OTHER INVOLVES FRAUDULENT
PERMITS AT A PLASTICS FACTORY.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.508
EEH.
EEH.

13:09.550 --> 13:11.916
WELL, I'LL LEAVE IT
UP TO THE TWO OF YOU

13:11.950 --> 13:13.850
TO DECIDE WHO GETS WHICH.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.928
I AM THE HEAD
DETECTIVE.
WHO OWES ME.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.894
I COVERED YOUR BUTT
ON LAST MONTH'S PAPERWORK.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.966
DAMN IT.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.088
FOLLOW MY LEAD.
MCNAB!

13:26.130 --> 13:27.791
GET OVER HERE!

13:29.640 --> 13:31.858
I DON'T KNOW, O'HARA.
I DON'T THINK HE'S READY.

13:31.910 --> 13:35.107
YEAH, I...I DON'T
THINK HE IS EITHER.

13:35.140 --> 13:36.368
NO. I'M READY.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.006
ALL RIGHT.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.040
MCNAB, HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE TO DO

13:41.080 --> 13:43.048
SOME REAL POLICE WORK?

13:43.090 --> 13:44.387
I'D LOVE TO.

13:44.420 --> 13:46.081
NOW, TECHNICALLY,
YOU'LL BE WORKING

13:46.120 --> 13:48.350
UNDER DETECTIVE O'HARA
AND MYSELF,

13:48.390 --> 13:50.119
BUT WE'LL LET YOU
TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.993
IT WILL BE SUCH
A GOOD EXPERIENCE FOR YOU.

13:53.030 --> 13:57.865
IT MIGHT EVEN EARN YOU A SPOT
ON THE DETECTIVE BUREAU SOMEDAY.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.492
WOW! THAN KS, GUYS.

13:59.530 --> 14:00.667
THIS MEANS A LOT.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.634
THE FACT THAT YOU THINK
SO HIGHLY OF ME TO TRUST ME--

14:02.670 --> 14:04.831
YEAH, YEAH, WE LOVE YOU.
GET BACK TO WORK.

14:10.010 --> 14:13.411
THIS TICKET IS FROM
30 YEARS AGO

14:13.450 --> 14:15.475
WHEN MY DAD RAN THE SHOP.

14:18.050 --> 14:20.450
I'LL HAVE TO GO LOOK
THROUGH THE BOX.

14:20.490 --> 14:21.980
(Shawn)
BOX?

14:22.020 --> 14:23.487
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE BOX IS?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.919
A GIANT ROOM
LIKE IN RAIDERS?

14:25.960 --> 14:27.097
I THINK IT'S A BOX.

14:27.130 --> 14:28.995
SECRET CATACOM BS
UNDERNEATH THE BUILDING

14:29.030 --> 14:29.689
LIKE IN NATIONAL TREASURE?

14:29.730 --> 14:31.493
SHAME ON YOU
FOR KNOWING THAT.

14:31.530 --> 14:33.031
(man)
THIS IS WHERE WE KEEP

14:33.070 --> 14:35.891
ALL THE OLD UNCLAIMED STUFF
FROM OVER THE YEARS.

14:35.940 --> 14:37.407
AS I SAID, A BOX.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.305
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
INSIDE THE BOX?
WILL YOU CALM DOWN?

14:39.340 --> 14:40.500
I CAN'T, MAN!
THERE'S STUFF IN THERE!

14:40.540 --> 14:42.405
ALL KINDS OF STUFF,
OLD STUFF, SHINY STUFF,

14:42.440 --> 14:44.601
SECRET STUFF--HOW COME
YOU'RE NOT AS EXCITED AS I AM?

14:44.650 --> 14:46.914
BECAUSE I'M NOT
A RACCOON.
YOU LOOK LIKE A RACCOON.

14:46.950 --> 14:48.577
(man)
HEY, YOU'RE IN LUCK.

14:48.620 --> 14:53.956
THIS TICKET HERE...
MATCHES THIS OLD RECEIPT.

14:53.990 --> 14:55.582
NOT A LOT OF INFO ON IT,
I'M AFRAID.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.325
I KNOW WHAT THAT--
SHH!
[mutters]

15:04.370 --> 15:05.962
RIGHT. YOUR CASE.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.365
OH, I'M GETTING
SOMETHING HERE.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.288
OH, THIS IS INTENSE.
I CAN SEE EUGENE.

15:09.340 --> 15:10.705
HE'S DESPERATE
AND HE'S SWEATING NERVOUSLY.

15:10.740 --> 15:13.402
HE'S STINKY, HE WANTS
TO GET RID OF SOMETHING,

15:13.440 --> 15:14.998
COVER HIS TRACKS,
HIDE WHERE HE'S BEEN.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.678
SO HE BRINGS IN
THE TITLE TO HIS CAR.

15:16.710 --> 15:18.405
THAT MUST BE THE VEHICLE
IDENTIFICATION NUMBER

15:18.450 --> 15:19.439
RIGHT IN THERE.

15:19.480 --> 15:22.244
RIGHT. WHOSE BENEFIT
WAS THAT FOR?

15:22.280 --> 15:24.009
DON'T EVER QUESTION
MY METHODS

15:24.050 --> 15:26.689
IN FRONT OF A CIVILIAN,
OKAY?

15:26.720 --> 15:28.017
NEVER DO THAT.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.049
COME HERE.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.384
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT EUGENE

15:32.430 --> 15:33.988
WAS GONNA USE THE CAR
IN THE BOMB PLOT.

15:34.030 --> 15:35.497
THAT WAS A COMMON
M.O. BACK THEN.

15:35.530 --> 15:37.998
HE PROBABLY PAWNED THE TITLE
TO COVER HIS TRACKS.

15:38.030 --> 15:39.520
(man)
IF NOBODY RECLAIMED THE TITLE,

15:39.570 --> 15:41.037
WE WOULD HAVE SOLD IT.

15:43.040 --> 15:46.066
WE COULD USE THE VIN NUMBER
TO TRACK WHERE IT ENDED UP.

15:46.110 --> 15:47.236
THAT COULD TAKE US
ALL OVER THE CITY

15:47.280 --> 15:49.578
OR THE STATE, FOR THAT MATTER,
THUS INCREASING THE CHANCES

15:49.610 --> 15:51.999
THAT YOU'LL BE SEEN
BY SOMEONE YOU WORK WITH,

15:52.050 --> 15:54.211
AND YOU BEING CAUGHT
BY THE POLICE.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.678
UNLESS...

16:03.590 --> 16:05.956
NOBODY RECOGNIZES US.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.295
I FEEL RIDICULOUS.

16:12.330 --> 16:14.491
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.
I'VE GOT THIS SHIRT AT HOME.

16:14.540 --> 16:15.996
HIS MOTHER
USED TO LOVE IT.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.200
YEAH, LIKE 30 YEARS AGO.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.037
KID, I WORE IT
TO LUNCH LAST WEEK.

16:22.340 --> 16:24.604
(Henry)
THERE IT IS.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.402
IT'S BEEN SITTIN' IN SOME
OLD LADY'S BACKYARD

16:26.450 --> 16:27.644
FOR DANG NEAR 30 YEARS.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.477
YOU GOT THE KEYS?
LET'S TAKE A LOOK INSIDE.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.147
MAKE ME AN OFFER,
AND IT'S YOURS.

16:31.190 --> 16:33.249
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN'.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.289
JUST GIVE US
A SECOND HERE.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.528
ALL RIGHT, HOW MUCH MONEY
DO WE HAVE BETWEEN US?

16:41.560 --> 16:44.620
WHAT? UH...
I THINK I GOT ABOUT...

16:44.670 --> 16:46.422
50 BUCKS.

16:46.470 --> 16:48.563
I GOT ABOUT 400 BETWEEN
MY WALLET AND MY SOCK.

16:53.610 --> 16:55.407
IT'S MY "JUST IN CASE"
MONEY.

16:55.440 --> 17:00.218
ALL RIGHT. ADD IN WHAT I HAVE,
AND WE'VE GOT ABOUT...

17:00.250 --> 17:01.444
450.

17:02.650 --> 17:04.208
ALL RIGHT,
LET ME GO TALK TO HIM.

17:04.250 --> 17:05.444
AH, AH, AH.
YOU STAND DOWN, POPEYE DOYLE.

17:05.490 --> 17:07.708
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

17:10.660 --> 17:12.218
GOT ABOUT $450 HERE.

17:12.260 --> 17:14.228
NOW, HOW MUCH
IS THIS GONNA COST ME?

17:14.260 --> 17:16.057
$450.
DONE.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.260
[keys jangle]

17:17.300 --> 17:18.267
[laughs]
HE'S GOOD!

17:18.300 --> 17:21.428
NICE GOIN', SHAWN.
THAT WAS ALL OF OUR MONEY.

17:21.470 --> 17:23.768
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU SEND IN THE ONE GUY

17:23.810 --> 17:25.266
WHO'S NEVER BOUGHT
A CAR BEFORE.

17:25.310 --> 17:26.459
WE HAD EXACTLY ENOUGH.

17:26.510 --> 17:28.478
ALL RIGHT, LOOK AT IT
THIS WAY, GUS.

17:28.510 --> 17:29.772
IT ISN'T A CAR.

17:29.810 --> 17:32.608
IT'S A TIME MACHINE.

17:32.650 --> 17:35.278
THIS LITTLE KITTY'S
GONNA TELL US ABOUT EUGENE

17:35.320 --> 17:36.446
30 YEARS AGO.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.584
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
A CAR TO ME.

17:38.620 --> 17:40.417
AND IF I BOUGHT IT,
I'M DRIVIN' IT.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.587
THAT MEANS MY SAME
CAR RULES APPLY.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.850
WIPE YOUR SHOES
BEFORE ENTERING.

17:44.890 --> 17:47.393
NO SLAMMING DOORS.
NO FOOD.

17:54.900 --> 17:57.232
LOOKS GOOD UP HERE.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.653
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
FACTORY SOLDERING.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.699
SMUGGLER'S HATCH.

18:30.670 --> 18:32.763
GOTTA GET THIS DOWN
TO THE CRIME LAB.

18:32.810 --> 18:34.630
AH, AH, AH.
LET ME GUESS.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.170
THIS IS WHERE WE TAKE
ONE STEP BACK

18:36.210 --> 18:37.404
BEFORE INVOLVING
THE POLICE.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.771
WE NEED TO SEE WHAT'S
ON THAT FILM FIRST.

18:42.850 --> 18:44.579
THAT'S HOW WE ROLL.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.566
[clears throat]

19:00.670 --> 19:02.865
I THINK I NEED
A TETANUS SHOT.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.668
GOT IT.

19:05.710 --> 19:07.769
MIRACLE ANYTHING
CAME OUT.

19:12.910 --> 19:15.470
THIS GUY REALLY
LOVED HIS CAR, HUH?

19:15.520 --> 19:16.873
WELL, AFTER SEEING IT
ALL CLEANED UP,

19:16.920 --> 19:18.410
I LIKE IT TOO.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.714
IN FACT, I LOVE IT.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.228
(Shawn)
BINGO--YOU THINK
THESE TWO OTHER ONES

19:23.260 --> 19:25.387
COULD HAVE HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THE BOMBING?

19:25.430 --> 19:26.624
(Henry)
FROM THE AK-47s
THEY'RE HOLDING,

19:26.660 --> 19:28.298
THEY HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH SOMETHING.

19:28.330 --> 19:29.592
I THINK IT'S WORTH
CHECKIN' OUT.

19:29.630 --> 19:31.188
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHERE THEY ARE,

19:31.230 --> 19:32.720
IF THEY'RE EVEN
STILL AROUND.

19:32.770 --> 19:34.931
YOU KNOW, BACK THEN, I USED TO
HAVE THIS SNITCH WORKING FOR ME.

19:34.970 --> 19:36.699
HIS NAME WAS POOKIE.
REAL WEASEL.

19:36.740 --> 19:39.538
THE GUY WOULD TURN ON
HIS SIAMESE TWIN FOR A BUCK.

19:39.570 --> 19:41.504
IF THESE TWO HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THIS,

19:41.540 --> 19:42.609
POOKIE'S THE GUY
WHO WOULD HAVE KNOWN.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.608
AHEM. SORRY.
WHAT--WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

19:44.650 --> 19:45.799
POOKIE.

19:45.850 --> 19:46.942
[Gus snickering]

19:46.980 --> 19:49.744
DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE
CAN FIND THIS, UH...

19:49.780 --> 19:51.816
POOKIE?

19:51.850 --> 19:53.659
YEAH, HIS NAME IS--
HIS NAME IS POOKIE WIGGINGTON,

19:53.690 --> 19:55.555
AND, YEAH, I KNOW
WHERE TO FIND HIM.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.489
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

19:58.530 --> 19:59.679
STOP, PLEASE!

19:59.730 --> 20:00.992
NOTHING'S FUNNY,
YOU JUST--

20:01.030 --> 20:02.918
BUT YOU'RE KEEPIN' IT
REAL RIGHT NOW, DAD.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.461
RIGHT ON.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.593
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
IF WE CAN FIND POOKIE.

20:06.630 --> 20:07.790
[laughing]

20:07.840 --> 20:10.195
SEE IF HE STILL
REMEMBERS THE '705.

20:12.840 --> 20:16.332
[brakes screeching]

20:21.480 --> 20:22.742
IF THAT HAD BEEN
ON PURPOSE,

20:22.780 --> 20:24.680
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
TOTALLY COOL.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.608
I NEED TO GET THAT
POWER STEERING FIXED.

20:26.650 --> 20:28.857
NOT TO MENTION THE SEAT IS
JAMMED ALL THE WAY TO THE FRONT

20:28.890 --> 20:31.427
AND MAKES MY
ENTIRE LEFT SIDE FALL ASLEEP.

20:42.770 --> 20:45.898
(D.J.)
AND REMEMBER, TOMORROW NIGHT
WILL BE LADIES' NIGHT

20:45.940 --> 20:47.532
AT THE TOP FLIGHT DANCE CLUB,

20:47.580 --> 20:50.276
WHERE IT'S THE '70s
EVERY NIGHT!

20:51.680 --> 20:52.578
DON'T WORRY!

20:52.610 --> 20:55.738
I THINK POOKIE REMEMBERS
THE '705 JUST FINE.

20:55.780 --> 20:58.681
AND BY THE WAY,
I'M JUST PUTTIN' THIS OUT THERE.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.881
ONCE WE RE-SOLVE THIS CASE,

21:00.920 --> 21:02.808
PRESERVE YOUR LEGACY
AS A DETECTIVE,

21:02.860 --> 21:04.748
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY
THANK YOU.

21:04.790 --> 21:06.758
NO BIGGIE.
COURSE IT IS.

21:06.790 --> 21:08.929
HECK, LET ME
SAY IT RIGHT NOW.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.291
THANK YOU, GUS.

21:10.330 --> 21:12.366
YOU'RE WELCOME.

21:13.770 --> 21:15.533
(Henry)
THAT'S POOKIE.
LET'S GO.

21:21.110 --> 21:22.975
OFFICER SPENCER.

21:23.010 --> 21:25.843
LONG TIME NO SEE.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.815
WHAT BRINGS YOU GENTLEMEN
TO MY ESTABLISHMENT?

21:28.850 --> 21:30.738
WELL, MR. POOKIE.

21:30.790 --> 21:31.745
[snickers]

21:31.790 --> 21:33.041
AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD,

21:33.090 --> 21:35.012
THE D.A. RECENTLY
OVERTURNED THE CONVICTION

21:35.060 --> 21:38.086
ON THE EUGENE FRANKS
BOMBING CASE.

21:38.130 --> 21:41.554
MAYBE I HEARD.
MAYBE I DIDN'T.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.589
RIGHT.

21:43.670 --> 21:44.819
WELL, WE'RE LOOKIN'
FOR INFORMATION

21:44.870 --> 21:47.088
ON A FEW PEOPLE THAT MIGHT HAVE
USED TO RUN WITH OLD EUGENE.

21:47.130 --> 21:49.837
SORRY. I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT.

21:49.870 --> 21:51.508
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I KNOW HOW THIS WORKS.

21:51.540 --> 21:53.405
GUS, HIT THE OTHER SOCK.
GIVE HIM SOME MONEY.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.738
NO OFFENSE, GUYS, BUT I DON'T
NEED YOUR POCKET CHANGE.

21:55.780 --> 21:56.678
MR. POOKIE,

21:56.710 --> 21:58.974
I CAN SEE TWO OF EUGENE'S
PARTNERS IN CRIME,

21:59.010 --> 22:00.819
A MAN AND A WOMAN--

22:00.850 --> 22:04.013
DANGEROUS, HIGHLY SKILLED
WITH MILITARY WEAPONS.

22:04.050 --> 22:05.779
BUT NOT U.S. MILITARY.

22:05.820 --> 22:08.459
SMUGGLED WEAPONS.

22:08.490 --> 22:10.355
I USED TO TRIP LIKE THAT.

22:10.390 --> 22:12.585
ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR THE ESCAPE.

22:12.630 --> 22:13.699
(Henry)
POOKIE, HE'S COOL.

22:13.730 --> 22:15.755
HE'S, UH...

22:15.800 --> 22:17.665
PSYCHIC.

22:19.470 --> 22:20.437
REALLY?

22:20.470 --> 22:21.630
THEN I CAN DIG IT.

22:21.670 --> 22:22.967
SPIRITUAL.
YEAH.

22:24.540 --> 22:25.632
THIRD EYE.

22:25.670 --> 22:26.762
THAT'S WHERE IT IS.

22:26.810 --> 22:29.938
HEY, YOU GUYS ARE DEEP.
LIKE ME.

22:29.980 --> 22:31.072
GIMME FIVE.

22:31.110 --> 22:32.543
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

22:32.580 --> 22:34.571
SO LISTEN,

22:34.620 --> 22:35.848
YOU WERE DEAD ON IT.

22:35.880 --> 22:36.869
CHECK THIS OUT.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.548
THE CATS YOU WERE DESCRIBING

22:39.590 --> 22:41.615
RAN WITH EUGENE, ALL RIGHT.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.389
MM-HMM. THERE WERE
TWO OF 'EM.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.853
DEREK FORD,
WHITE GUY, STRINGY HAIR,

22:45.890 --> 22:47.699
AND HIS OLD LADY MELANIE.

22:47.730 --> 22:48.924
REALLY FINE.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.167
I GOT SHOT OVER
A WHITE GIRL LIKE THAT ONCE.

22:51.200 --> 22:54.067
ANYWAY, THEY WERE TOGETHER

22:54.100 --> 22:57.638
IN A MILITANT ORGANIZATION
WITH EUGENE CALLED S.A.G.

22:57.670 --> 22:59.900
SOLDIERS AGAINST GOVERNMENT.

22:59.940 --> 23:01.635
THEY WERE INTO ALL KIND
OF RADICAL STUFF.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.545
WHY WOULD EUGENE
GO ALL THOSE YEARS

23:03.580 --> 23:05.104
AND NOT RAT THEM OUT?

23:05.150 --> 23:08.779
WORD ON THE STREET WAS
THAT S.A.G. WAS RUTHLESS.

23:08.820 --> 23:11.914
NOBODY DARED CROSS THEM,
NOT EVEN ONE OF THEIR OWN.

23:11.950 --> 23:14.919
(Shawn)
SO EUGENE WAS
JUST A PATSY?

23:14.960 --> 23:18.487
YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT FROM ME.
NO, THEM SUCKERS ARE DANGEROUS!

23:21.960 --> 23:23.461
HE HAD PARTNERS.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.866
MY BIGGEST BUST...

23:25.900 --> 23:36.037
AND I WAS WRONG.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.547
EVERYTHING HURTS.

23:37.580 --> 23:40.140
YOU HAD TO BE A TOUGH
GUY AND GO IN FIRST.

23:40.180 --> 23:42.148
LET'S JUST FILL OUT
THE INCIDENT REPORT

23:42.180 --> 23:44.614
AND BE DONE WITH THIS
FIASCO. OW.

23:47.690 --> 23:49.681
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU GUYS?

23:49.720 --> 23:51.153
THE DIAMOND
SMUGGLING CASE

23:51.190 --> 23:53.499
THAT DETECTIVE O'HARA
WANTED TO TAKE

23:53.530 --> 23:55.088
DIDN'T GO
QUITE AS PLANNED.

23:55.130 --> 23:56.495
THAT I WANTED
TO TAKE?

23:56.530 --> 23:57.963
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO INSISTED ON IT,

23:58.000 --> 23:59.627
MR. HEAD DETECTIVE.

23:59.670 --> 24:02.639
BASICALLY, WE CONDUCTED
A STAKEOUT

24:02.670 --> 24:03.864
TO CATCH THE SMUGGLERS
RED-HANDED,

24:03.910 --> 24:06.128
BUT WHEN WE OPENED
THE CARGO CONTAINER

24:06.170 --> 24:07.637
TO SEIZE THE EVIDENCE,

24:07.680 --> 24:09.978
WE DISCOVERED
WE HAD THE WRONG ONE.

24:10.010 --> 24:13.047
THIS ONE BELONGED
TO EXOTIC ANIMAL SMUGGLERS.

24:13.080 --> 24:16.641
AND IT WAS FILLED...
WITH WILD MARMOSETS.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.545
I HATE MARMOSETS.

24:18.590 --> 24:20.217
APPARENTLY, THEY DON'T
LIKE BEING SHOT AT.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.059
NO, APPARENTLY NOT.

24:22.090 --> 24:23.648
ALL I CAN REMEMBER
AFTER THAT

24:23.690 --> 24:27.626
ARE HUNDREDS OF THOSE
TINY, RAZOR-SHARP CLAWS

24:27.660 --> 24:29.127
AND TEETH!

24:29.160 --> 24:30.866
LOWER PRIMATE, MY ASS.

24:30.900 --> 24:33.630
I RECOGNIZE A MILITARY
FORMATION WHEN I SEE ONE.

24:33.670 --> 24:35.194
YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW
THAT CASE YOU GAVE ME

24:35.240 --> 24:36.935
TOOK A FUN TURN.

24:36.970 --> 24:38.699
THAT'S GREAT!

24:38.740 --> 24:40.571
IT TURNS OUT
THAT PLASTICS FACTORY

24:40.610 --> 24:43.943
WAS A FRONT
FOR REAL-LIFE SEA PIRATES.

24:43.980 --> 24:45.572
YOU'RE KIDDING.

24:45.610 --> 24:47.919
THEY'VE BEEN USING
HIGH-TECH BOATS AND GPS

24:47.950 --> 24:49.713
TO ROB FREIGHTERS
IN THE SHIPPING LANES.

24:49.750 --> 24:51.684
NOW I'M TEAMING UP
WITH THE COAST GUARD

24:51.720 --> 24:53.813
FOR A SHOWDOWN
OFF THE SANTA BARBARA COAST.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.555
ON THE HIGH SEAS?

24:55.590 --> 24:57.251
APPEARS SO.

24:59.330 --> 25:01.218
AH, GOSH,

25:01.260 --> 25:02.898
I'M SORRY, BUZZ,

25:02.930 --> 25:05.023
BUT YOU NEED A CERTAIN
LEVEL OF CLEARANCE

25:05.070 --> 25:06.628
TO WORK WITH
THE COAST GUARD.

25:06.670 --> 25:08.661
IT'S...
IT'S DEPARTMENT RULES.

25:08.700 --> 25:10.702
REALLY?

25:10.740 --> 25:12.628
YEAH. YEAH, I'M AFRAID
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO...

25:12.670 --> 25:14.672
TAKE OVER FROM HERE.

25:14.710 --> 25:17.304
BUT GOOD WORK ON GETTING
US TO THIS POINT.

25:17.340 --> 25:19.649
OH.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.978
WELL...

25:22.020 --> 25:24.045
IT WAS FUN
WHILE IT LASTED.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.648
YEAH.
YEAH.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.658
GOOD WORK, BUDDY.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.052
WE'RE GONNA CAPTURE
PIRATES!

25:32.090 --> 25:34.126
I KNOW! OW!

25:34.160 --> 25:36.299
ALMOST MAKES UP
FOR THE RABIES SHOTS.

25:36.330 --> 25:37.661
ALMOST.

25:39.070 --> 25:41.698
(Henry)
LET'S FACE IT, SHAWN.
I BLEW THE CASE.

25:41.740 --> 25:43.560
YOU'RE QUITTING ON ME?

25:43.610 --> 25:44.599
I'M NOT QUITTING.

25:44.640 --> 25:46.665
I JUST REALIZED
THAT MAYBE CHIEF VICK IS RIGHT.

25:46.710 --> 25:47.904
I SHOULD STAY OUT OF IT.

25:47.940 --> 25:49.805
DAD, THIS WAS YOUR BIG CASE.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.343
[chuckles]
MY BIG CASE.
MY BIG BUST.

25:52.380 --> 25:53.972
YOU SEE, THAT'S
THE PROBLEM RIGHT THERE.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.840
THAT'S HOW I STARTED
SEEING IT.

25:55.880 --> 25:58.815
BUT IN REALITY,
IT'S A SANTA BARBARA P.D. CASE

25:58.850 --> 26:00.818
AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.213
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

26:02.260 --> 26:04.683
A GOOD DETECTIVE KNOWS
WHEN TO LET IT GO, SHAWN.

26:04.730 --> 26:05.549
THAT'S A LESSON

26:05.590 --> 26:08.024
BOTH YOU AND I
COULD LEARN RIGHT NOW.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.334
WHERE'S YOUR DAD?
HE'S NOT COMING.

26:14.370 --> 26:15.837
HE SAYS
IT'S TO PROTECT THE CASE,

26:15.870 --> 26:17.838
BUT I CAN TELL
IT'S REALLY BUMMING HIM OUT

26:17.870 --> 26:19.963
THAT HE GOT FOOLED
30 YEARS AGO.

26:24.310 --> 26:26.198
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M ABOUT TO SAY THIS,

26:26.250 --> 26:28.741
BUT INSTEAD OF LORDING OVER HIM
THAT THIS IS OUR CASE,

26:28.780 --> 26:30.213
OUR RULES...

26:30.250 --> 26:31.808
I THINK WE
HAVE TO CONVINCE HIM

26:31.850 --> 26:33.784
THAT WE CAN'T SOLVE
THIS THING WITHOUT HIM.

26:33.820 --> 26:34.650
HOW DO WE DO THAT?

26:34.690 --> 26:37.113
MOST LIKELY,
THROUGH THE USE OF TRICKERY.

26:38.860 --> 26:41.693
(Henry)
so WHAT KIND OF WOOD
ARE WE GONNA USE

26:41.730 --> 26:42.822
FOR THESE BOOKSHELVES, GUS?

26:42.860 --> 26:43.929
UH. . .CYPRESS?

26:43.970 --> 26:45.926
CYPRESS? REALLY?

26:45.970 --> 26:47.221
IT'S A GOOD WOOD.

26:47.270 --> 26:48.430
IT'S WHAT NOAH'S ARK
WAS MADE OF.

26:48.470 --> 26:50.961
NAH, YOU WANNA USE SOMETHING
THAT BREATHES A LITTLE MORE,

26:51.010 --> 26:53.160
BUT DON'T WORRY, WE'LL HIT
A LUMBERYARD ON THE WAY THERE.

26:53.210 --> 26:56.338
AT LEAST I GET A CHANCE
TO USE MY NEW LASER LEVEL.

27:02.050 --> 27:04.280
GUS, WHY ARE WE
STOPPING HERE?

27:04.320 --> 27:05.685
NO REASON--I JUST
RANDOMLY SELECTED THIS SPOT.

27:05.720 --> 27:07.187
DON'T BE A SMART-ASS.

27:07.220 --> 27:08.778
YOU'RE READING AN ADDRESS
OFF A PIECE OF PAPER,

27:08.820 --> 27:09.718
AND WE'RE SITTING
IN SOMEBODY'S DRIVEWAY.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.853
WHOSE HOUSE IS THIS?

27:11.890 --> 27:12.857
OKAY, LOOK, DAD, ACTUALLY,

27:12.890 --> 27:14.391
WE'RE DROPPING IN ON SOME PEOPLE
THAT WE KNOW.

27:14.430 --> 27:16.819
[tires squealing]

27:16.860 --> 27:18.862
(Gus)
SHAWN, I THINK THAT'S THEM!

27:18.900 --> 27:20.162
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

27:20.200 --> 27:21.667
DON'T LOSE 'EM.
GO, GO, GO!

27:21.700 --> 27:23.736
COME ON!

27:24.740 --> 27:29.200
[tires squealing]

27:45.030 --> 27:46.782
[honking]

28:02.010 --> 28:03.705
[rewing engine]

28:12.050 --> 28:13.984
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

28:14.020 --> 28:15.009
I DON'T KNOW.

28:15.060 --> 28:17.449
I'VE NEVER
CORNERED ANYONE BEFORE.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.769
OOH! THEY BETTER HOPE
THEY'RE NOT UNEVEN IN THERE.

28:27.800 --> 28:30.030
I'M GONNA BLIND 'EM
WITH THE LASER, SHAWN.

28:39.380 --> 28:41.143
MAY WE HELP YOU?

28:41.180 --> 28:43.819
UH...

28:43.850 --> 28:45.943
DEREK AND MELANIE FORD?

28:45.990 --> 28:50.108
[chuckles]
OR SHOULD I SAY
SOLDIERS AGAINST GOVERNMENT?

28:54.430 --> 28:56.955
YOU SURE YOUR FATHER
DOESN'T WANT TO COME INSIDE?

28:57.000 --> 28:58.490
OH, NO, NO, NO.
HE'S CLINICALLY INSANE.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.760
AND A BITER.

29:00.800 --> 29:01.835
SORRY AGAIN ABOUT
RUNNING FROM YOU GUYS,

29:01.870 --> 29:04.031
BUT WHEN WE SAW THE MERCURY
COUGAR IN THE DRIVEWAY,

29:04.070 --> 29:06.163
WE JUST FIGURED
IT WAS EUGENE

29:06.210 --> 29:07.973
COMING AFTER US
FOR REVENGE.

29:08.010 --> 29:09.409
REVENGE FOR WHAT?

29:09.440 --> 29:10.839
HE THINKS THAT

29:10.880 --> 29:12.177
WE SET HIM UP
TO TAKE THE RAP

29:12.210 --> 29:13.973
FOR THE POLICE
HEADQUARTERS BOMBING.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.908
WE KNOW HE'S BEEN
ASKING AROUND TOWN ABOUT US,

29:15.950 --> 29:18.384
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
OUR WHEREABOUTS.

29:18.420 --> 29:20.081
WE THOUGHT HE'D FINALLY
FOUND US.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.917
WELL, DON'T YOU
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.416
YOU HELP US WITH
THIS INVESTIGATION,

29:23.460 --> 29:25.087
WE WILL MAKE SURE
THE POLICE PROTECT YOU

29:25.130 --> 29:26.256
FROM YOUR OLD PAL
EUGENE.

29:26.290 --> 29:27.279
THANK YOU.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.055
TELL HIM EVERYTHING,
HONEY.

29:32.570 --> 29:34.128
OKAY.

29:34.170 --> 29:36.092
AFTER EUGENE GOT ARRESTED
30 YEARS AGO,

29:36.140 --> 29:39.200
WE FREAKED OUT, AND WE
STOPPED OUR RADICAL WAYS.

29:39.240 --> 29:41.379
WE BECAME SOLDIERS
FOR GOVERNMENT.

29:41.410 --> 29:44.049
WE BUILT THIS GREAT LIFE.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.206
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE US.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.241
WE HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH SETTING EUGENE UP.

29:47.280 --> 29:50.215
I MEAN, WE WERE
ALL BRAINWASHED.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.342
WE WERE ALL CAUGHT UP
IN THE MOVEMENT.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.039
DO YOU KNOW OF ANYONE ELSE

29:53.090 --> 29:55.058
WHO WOULD HAVE WANTED
TO SET HIM UP?

29:55.090 --> 29:56.057
OH!

29:56.090 --> 29:58.285
HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

29:58.330 --> 30:00.025
OH, YEAH. OH!

30:00.060 --> 30:01.322
I CUT MYSELF PRETTY GOOD.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.191
I, UH--EXCUSE ME.

30:03.230 --> 30:05.892
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
GO PUT SOMETHING ON THIS.

30:16.110 --> 30:17.873
SORRY.

30:17.910 --> 30:19.343
WE SHOULD GET GOING.
OH, NO.

30:19.380 --> 30:20.916
NO, NO, NO.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION.

30:20.950 --> 30:22.417
AND REST ASSURED,
EUGENE WILL NOT LEARN

30:22.450 --> 30:23.439
OF YOUR WHEREABOUTS.

30:23.480 --> 30:24.583
THANKS AGAIN.
NICE MEETING YOU.

30:24.620 --> 30:26.178
(Shawn)
HOPE YOUR FINGER
FEELS BETTER!

30:26.220 --> 30:27.346
(Melanie)
THANK YOU!

30:27.390 --> 30:28.516
GOOD NEWS, POP!

30:28.560 --> 30:29.879
THE TRAIL IS HOT AGAIN.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.421
LIKE I SAID,
COUNT ME OUT.

30:31.460 --> 30:34.156
DAMN IT, DAD, DO YOU
HAVE TO BE SO PRIDEFUL

30:34.200 --> 30:35.451
ALL THE TIME?

30:35.500 --> 30:37.991
SO YOU MADE A MISTAKE
30 YEARS AGO.

30:38.030 --> 30:39.224
NOBODY CARES.
JUST GET OVER IT.

30:39.270 --> 30:42.137
NOT EVERYBODY'S AS COMFORTABLE
SCREWIN' UP AS YOU ARE, KID.

30:42.170 --> 30:44.263
WELL, MAYBE THE REASON I'M SO
COMFORTABLE IS BECAUSE

30:44.310 --> 30:47.006
MY MISTAKES IS THE ONLY THING
THAT WAS EVER POINTED OUT TO ME.

30:47.040 --> 30:49.201
[chuckling]
HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO.
WOULD YOU PUT AWAY THE VIOLIN?

30:49.240 --> 30:50.229
I POINTED OUT
THE GOOD STUFF, SHAWN.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.009
BUT USUALLY, YOU WERE TOO BUSY

30:52.050 --> 30:54.314
BRAGGING AND SHOWING OFF
TO TAKE NOTICE.

30:54.350 --> 30:56.318
ENOUGH. I'M SICK OF YOU TWO
FIGHTING ALL THE TIME.

30:56.350 --> 30:58.443
LISTEN, MR. SPENCER,
SHAWN NEEDS YOU ON THE CASE

30:58.490 --> 31:00.139
BECAUSE, FRANKLY,
YOU'RE OLD,

31:00.190 --> 31:02.249
AND WE WERE BARELY
EVEN ALIVE DURING THE '705.

31:02.290 --> 31:04.383
AND SHAWN, YOUR DAD
NEEDS YOU ON THE CASE

31:04.430 --> 31:06.227
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN
BE EXTREMELY ANNOYING,

31:06.260 --> 31:09.229
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A BRILLIANT
IDEA EVERY NOW AND THEN.

31:09.260 --> 31:10.056
BUT YOU'RE BOTH
TOO DAMN STUBBORN

31:10.100 --> 31:11.624
TO ADMIT THAT YOU NEED
EACH OTHER.

31:11.670 --> 31:14.161
NOW CAN WE GO, PLEASE?
THANK YOU.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.168
IS HE ALWAYS
SUCH A KNOW-IT-ALL?

31:17.200 --> 31:19.236
[scoffs]
YOU DON'T KNOW THE HALF OF IT.
VERY PREACHY.

31:21.410 --> 31:22.968
ALL RIGHT,
SO TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE.

31:23.010 --> 31:24.602
WELL, I THINK THERE'S
ANOTHER S.A.G. MEMBER OUT THERE.

31:24.650 --> 31:25.446
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

31:25.480 --> 31:27.300
DID YOU SEE MELANIE
WHEN WE ASKED HER

31:29.180 --> 31:31.182
SHE CUT HERSELF RIGHT THERE,
RIGHT THERE ON THE SPOT.

31:31.220 --> 31:32.448
NO, NO, MAYBE THEY WERE
TELLING YOU

31:32.490 --> 31:33.980
WHAT THEY WANTED YOU
TO KNOW,

31:34.020 --> 31:35.214
NOT WHAT YOU NEEDED TO KNOW.

31:35.260 --> 31:37.956
I THINK THEY'RE PROTECTING
SOMEBODY FROM EUGENE.

31:37.990 --> 31:39.651
BUT THERE WERE ONLY
THREE PEOPLE IN THE PICTURE.

31:39.690 --> 31:41.157
NO, THERE WAS FOUR.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.089
THE THREE OF THEM
AND WHOEVER TOOK THE PICTURE.

31:44.130 --> 31:46.121
MAYBE THEY'RE PROTECTING
AN OLD MENTOR.

31:46.170 --> 31:48.263
WELL, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
EUGENE MET DEREK AND MELANIE

31:48.300 --> 31:50.962
WHEN THEY WERE ALL STUDENTS
AT SANTA BARBARA UNIVERSITY.

31:51.010 --> 31:54.969
LET'S SEE IF THEY SHARED ANY
PROFESSORS OR ADVISORS OR R.A.s.

31:55.010 --> 31:56.307
R.A.--THAT'S A THING,
RIGHT?

31:56.340 --> 31:57.170
IT IS.

31:57.210 --> 32:00.407
OKAY, LET'S DO THIS.
BACK TO UNDERCOVER.

32:00.450 --> 32:02.975
GOT IT.
THANK YOU, JULES.

32:03.020 --> 32:05.238
ALL RIGHT,
ACCORDING TO JULIET,

32:05.290 --> 32:08.214
UNIVERSITY RECORDS SHOW
THAT OUR S.A.G. MEMBERS

32:08.260 --> 32:09.511
ONLY SHARED ONE PROFESSOR,

32:09.560 --> 32:12.688
AND THAT IS
DR. RICHARD COLBERT.

32:21.270 --> 32:23.090
DR. COLBERT!

32:52.670 --> 32:59.735
I THINK EUGENE GOT HERE
BEFORE WE DID.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.476
HEY, I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR YOU GUYS.

33:01.510 --> 33:03.432
YEAH, WE GOT YOUR CALL WHEN
WE WERE OUT ON THE OPEN OCEAN

33:03.480 --> 33:04.742
CHASING DOWN OUR SEA PIRATES
AT FLANK.

33:04.780 --> 33:07.101
THAT'S A NAUTICAL TERM
FOR MAXIMUM SPEED.

33:07.150 --> 33:09.744
WE CORDONED THE PRIVATE VESSEL
BEFORE THEY COULD CLUB HAUL--

33:09.780 --> 33:12.146
THAT'S THE NAUTICAL TERM
FOR EVASIVE MAN EUVER--

33:12.190 --> 33:13.782
AND MAKE IT TO
INTERNATIONAL WATERS.

33:13.820 --> 33:15.151
THAT SOUNDS AWESOME.

33:15.190 --> 33:16.748
WHAT DO MODERN-DAY
SEA PIRATES LOOK LIKE?

33:16.790 --> 33:17.654
WE HAVE NO IDEA.

33:17.690 --> 33:19.351
APPARENTLY,
ONCE YOU GET THREE MILES OUT,

33:19.390 --> 33:20.584
IT'S OUT OF OUR JURISDICTION,

33:20.630 --> 33:22.257
SO THE COAST GUARD
HAS US SEQUESTERED

33:22.300 --> 33:23.597
TO A TINY, WIN DOWLESS CABIN
ON THE LUBBER DECK.

33:23.630 --> 33:25.461
YEAH, APPARENTLY
THAT'S A NAUTICAL TERM

33:25.500 --> 33:26.626
FOR PLACE THEY SEND YOU
TO PUKE.

33:26.670 --> 33:29.434
HAD TO WASH MY HAIR
TH REE TIMES.
STILL SORRY ABOUT THAT.

33:29.470 --> 33:31.062
LET'S DO THIS.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.669
SO, WHAT DO WE HAVE
HERE?

33:37.710 --> 33:40.508
WELL, THE DECEASED
IS ONE DR. RICHARD COLBERT.

33:40.550 --> 33:43.815
MALE, 60 YEARS OLD,
PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY.

33:43.850 --> 33:45.647
APPARENTLY, HE DIED
FROM A LAB ACCIDENT

33:45.690 --> 33:48.716
INVOLVING POISONOUS
HYDROCHLORIC ACID FUMES.

33:48.760 --> 33:49.749
WHEN WILL PEOPLE
EVER LEARN

33:49.790 --> 33:52.156
THAT ALCOHOL AND HYDROCHLORIC
ACID DON'T MIX?

33:52.190 --> 33:53.782
(Gus)
TECHNICALLY, THEY DO.

33:53.830 --> 33:55.718
SEE, THE HYDROGEN ATOMS
IN THE ACID

33:55.760 --> 33:57.694
FORM A LOOSE BOND
WITH THE CHLORINE AND--

33:57.730 --> 33:59.664
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU WEARING?

33:59.700 --> 34:01.167
OOH!

34:01.200 --> 34:02.690
I'M GETTIN' SOME SERIOUS JIVE,

34:04.110 --> 34:06.135
BZZ!

34:06.170 --> 34:07.728
(Shawn)
I CAN SEE THE STRUGGLE.

34:07.770 --> 34:09.476
THERE'S A RAG
ON COLBERT'S FACE.

34:09.510 --> 34:13.276
IT WAS HIM WHO MASTERMINDED
THE BOMBING 30 YEARS AGO.

34:13.310 --> 34:15.141
HE SET EUGENE UP.

34:15.180 --> 34:17.273
AND EUGENE HAS MURDERED HIM...

34:17.320 --> 34:19.140
IN REVENGE.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.716
BUT. . .WAIT!

34:23.760 --> 34:26.251
THERE'S MORE.

34:26.290 --> 34:28.690
OOH, YEAH!

34:29.700 --> 34:31.793
THE FIELD IS STRONG.

34:32.830 --> 34:36.459
OOH!
I AM GETTIN' IT.

34:36.500 --> 34:37.637
AND IT IS A BAD MOTHER--

34:37.670 --> 34:39.228
SHUT YOUR MOUTH!
I'M HAVIN' A VISION.

34:39.270 --> 34:40.305
I CAN DIG IT.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.544
OOH, IT'S A--

34:47.450 --> 34:49.111
IT'S A BIG
BIRTH DAY CAKE.

34:49.150 --> 34:50.117
(Gus)
OOH!

34:50.150 --> 34:51.686
MAKE A WISH!
WHAT?

34:52.790 --> 34:53.540
BOMB.

34:53.590 --> 34:54.887
EUGENE'S BUILT
ANOTHER BOMB!

34:54.920 --> 34:56.581
HE BUILT IT HERE IN THE LAB!

34:56.620 --> 34:58.759
THAT'S HOW HE'S GOING
TO EXACT HIS REVENGE

34:58.790 --> 34:59.779
ON THE REMAINING MEMBERS
OF S.A.G.!

34:59.830 --> 35:02.526
WE'VE GOTTA STOP HIM NOW!

35:02.560 --> 35:04.460
THAT'S ALL I GOT.
THE JIVE'S OVER.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.661
WE SHOULD GO
BEFORE PEOPLE EXPLODE.

35:08.540 --> 35:11.532
[sirens wailing]

35:24.550 --> 35:25.642
FOUND HIM LOOKIN'
AROUND OUT BACK.

35:25.690 --> 35:27.578
MUST HAVE HIDDEN THIS
UNDER THE HOUSE.

35:32.260 --> 35:33.887
WE GOT A BOMB!

35:33.930 --> 35:37.559
WHICH...HASN'T BEEN ACTIVATED.

35:37.600 --> 35:38.669
CALL THE BOMB SQUAD.

35:39.770 --> 35:41.260
WELL, EUGENE,

35:41.300 --> 35:43.165
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE
BEEN UP TO YOUR OLD TRICKS.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.509
I'M ONLY HERE BECAUSE
THEY CALLED ME

35:45.540 --> 35:47.337
SAYING THEY WERE FINALLY
READY TO COME CLEAN.

35:47.370 --> 35:49.577
INVITED GUESTS DON'T GO
SNOOPIN' AROUND THE BACK,

35:49.610 --> 35:50.634
NOW, DO THEY?

35:50.680 --> 35:53.308
I WAS JUST CHECKING
TO SEE IF ANYBODY WAS HOME.

35:53.350 --> 35:54.669
I SWEAR!
SAVE IT FOR THE TRIAL.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.210
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR
THE MURDER OF RICHARD COLBERT.

35:56.250 --> 35:58.889
WAIT, WAIT!
COLBERT'S DEAD?

35:58.920 --> 36:01.753
AND THE ATTEMPTED MURDER
OF DEREK AND MELANIE FORD.

36:01.790 --> 36:02.916
THANK GOD

36:02.960 --> 36:04.450
YOU STOPPED HIM IN TIME.

36:11.430 --> 36:12.966
I CUT MYSELF PRETTY GOOD.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.434
I NEED TO, UH, GO PUT
SOMETHING ON THIS.

36:15.470 --> 36:17.938
MAYBE THEY WERE TELLING YOU WHAT
THEY WANTED YOU TO KNOW, SHAWN,

36:17.970 --> 36:19.938
NOT WHAT YOU NEEDED TO KNOW.

36:19.970 --> 36:22.279
WHOA.

36:22.310 --> 36:24.540
LIES, LIES, LIES!

36:24.580 --> 36:25.808
LIES!

36:25.850 --> 36:28.410
YEAH !

36:30.580 --> 36:32.889
YOU TWO.

36:32.920 --> 36:35.718
YOU WERE TWO YOUNG KIDS
IN WAY OVER YOUR HEAD

36:35.760 --> 36:37.512
WITH THE MILITANT S.A.G.

36:37.560 --> 36:41.451
SO YOU USED EUGENE
AS A SCAPEGOAT, DIDN'T YOU?

36:41.500 --> 36:43.821
SET HIM UP TO TAKE THE FALL FOR
THE POLICE HEADQUARTERS BOMBING

36:43.860 --> 36:46.897
SO YOU COULD MAKE A CLEAN BREAK.

36:46.930 --> 36:48.932
BUT THEN YOU HEARD
HE GOT OUT EARLY,

36:48.970 --> 36:50.335
AND YOU WERE AFRAID
HE'D COME TRACK YOU DOWN

36:50.370 --> 36:51.564
AND EXPOSE
YOUR CRIMINAL PAST.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.407
WE KNOW HE'S BEEN
ASKING AROUND TOWN ABOUT US,

36:53.440 --> 36:55.738
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
OUR WHEREABOUTS.

36:55.780 --> 36:57.600
WE THOUGHT
HE'D FINALLY FOUND US.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.346
BECAUSE OF THE FOUR MEMBERS
OF S.A.G.,

36:59.380 --> 37:02.611
ONLY TWO OF YOU ARE DOIN'
OKAY FOR YOURSELVES.

37:02.650 --> 37:04.880
EUGENE HAS LOST 30 YEARS,

37:04.920 --> 37:07.445
AND HE WILL BE MARKED
AS A CRIMINAL FOREVER.

37:07.490 --> 37:09.913
AND DR. COLBERT, WELL, HIS
DRINKING DESTROYED HIS CAREER.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.951
BUT YOU TWO...

37:11.990 --> 37:14.754
WELL, YOUR LIFE
IS PICTURE-PERFECT.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.553
AND YOU WOULD KILL
TO PROTECT IT.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.659
FIRST, IT WAS DR. COLBERT.

37:19.700 --> 37:21.998
HIS GUILT-RIDDEN CONSCIENCE
AND DRUNK MOUTH

37:22.040 --> 37:24.508
WOULD CAUSE HIM TO CONFESS
EVERYTHING TO EUGENE.

37:24.540 --> 37:26.508
AND THEN THE PLAN WAS SIMPLE.

37:26.540 --> 37:29.930
FRAME EUGENE FOR THAT MURDER,
AND THEN BLOW EUGENE UP

37:29.980 --> 37:32.448
RIGHT ALONG WITH ALL
THE TRACES TO YOUR PAST

37:32.480 --> 37:35.472
SO YOU COULD MOVE ON
TO A VERY BRIGHT, WHITE

37:35.520 --> 37:36.669
PICKETY FUTURE.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.642
THAT'S A PREPOSTEROUS
THEORY.

37:38.690 --> 37:39.839
PREPOSTEROUS!

37:39.890 --> 37:40.948
YOU HAVE NO PROOF.

37:40.990 --> 37:41.786
OH, REALLY?

37:41.820 --> 37:44.755
WHAT IF I DID
SOMETHIN' LIKE THIS?

37:50.460 --> 37:52.018
SPENCER, WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU JUST DO?

37:52.070 --> 37:53.389
IN EXACTLY ONE MINUTE,

37:53.430 --> 37:55.864
WE WILL ALL BE BLOWN
TO SMITHEREENS.

37:55.900 --> 37:56.798
OR THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE

37:56.840 --> 38:00.901
FOR MAKING THAT BOMB
WILL DEACTIVATE IT.

38:00.940 --> 38:02.498
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
HE'S CRAZY.

38:02.540 --> 38:04.030
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO DO IT EITHER.

38:04.080 --> 38:07.402
I DEMAND THAT SOMEONE
DISARM THIS BOMB RIGHT NOW!

38:10.020 --> 38:11.885
(man)
JUST DO WHAT THEY SAY.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.388
(man #2)
LET'S GO, LET'S GO!
COME ON.

38:27.830 --> 38:28.967
ARREST THEM.

38:30.500 --> 38:33.060
COME ON.

38:33.110 --> 38:34.338
GO.

38:36.410 --> 38:38.344
SPENCER, I'D APPRECIATE IT
IN THE FUTURE

38:38.380 --> 38:39.904
IF YOU JUST PLAYED
WITH YOUR OWN LIFE.

38:39.950 --> 38:41.508
OH, COME ON, LASSIE.

38:41.550 --> 38:43.108
IF DEREK HADN'T CAVED,

38:43.150 --> 38:44.788
I WOULD HAVE JUST
DEACTIVATED IT MYSELF.

38:44.820 --> 38:45.844
IT'S VERY EASY.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.084
YOU JUST CLIP THE RED WIRE

38:47.120 --> 38:49.816
AND THE GREEN WIRE
AT THE SAME TIME.

38:49.860 --> 38:50.918
UH, SHAWN,

38:50.960 --> 38:53.588
THERE IS NO GREEN WIRE.

38:53.630 --> 38:55.951
REALLY? HUH.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.854
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
WE ALL WOULD HAVE DIED.

39:00.570 --> 39:02.595
I...AM STARVING.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.528
WHO'S UP FOR FAJITAS?
MY TREAT.

39:04.570 --> 39:07.937
OH, COME ON, YOU GUYS.
NOT EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE DIED.

39:07.970 --> 39:10.609
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE
WOULD HAVE LIVED.

39:10.640 --> 39:13.848
THOSE ARE THE--
THE ODDS ARE THAT AT LEAST ONE--

39:13.880 --> 39:15.518
GUS WOULD HAVE MADE IT.

39:18.650 --> 39:23.986
[mouthing words]

39:24.020 --> 39:25.180
IT'LL ONLY TAKE A FEW MINUTES

39:25.230 --> 39:27.152
FOR ME TO FINISH MY INTERVIEW
WITH THE INDEPENDENT.

39:27.190 --> 39:29.988
I STILL DON'T SEE WHY
YOU HAVE TO DRAG ME INTO THIS.

39:30.030 --> 39:32.396
I TOLD YOU--THEY'RE GONNA
WANT TO HEAR ABOUT MY LAST CASE,

39:32.430 --> 39:33.988
WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY YOUR CASE,
AND WITHOUT YOU,

39:34.030 --> 39:35.634
IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
SOLVED AGAIN.

39:35.670 --> 39:37.934
INTERVIEWS, PRESS, HAIR--
THOSE ARE YOUR THINGS.

39:37.970 --> 39:39.938
A LITTLE ATTENTION
ISN'T GONNA KILL YOU, DAD.

39:39.970 --> 39:41.107
ONE MORE THING.
WHAT?

39:43.640 --> 39:44.800
THANK YOU.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.849
(Lassiter)
AS THE BOMB TICKED
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ZERO,

39:56.890 --> 39:58.187
WE HELD OUR GROUND.

39:58.220 --> 40:00.029
AND I LOOKED THOSE
CULPRITS IN THE EYE,

40:00.060 --> 40:02.096
AND THEY KNEW THAT
THEIR TIME WAS UP.

40:02.130 --> 40:05.497
(Juliet)
WE DON'T SEEK OUT
THE HIGH-PROFILE CASES.

40:05.530 --> 40:08.499
THEY JUST HAVE A WAY
OF FINDING US.

40:08.540 --> 40:10.098
WELL, WE SHOULD
JUST SHOW HER.

40:10.140 --> 40:12.062
(Lassiter)
OH, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.066
YEAH, SO, UH...
YOU WERE THERE.

40:14.110 --> 40:15.805
YOU WERE HERE.
OH, I WAS HERE?

40:15.840 --> 40:18.070
NO, WE WALKED UP,
AND THEN THEY WALKED OUT.

40:18.110 --> 40:19.941
THEY DID?
YEAH, THEY CAME OUT
WITH THE--

40:19.980 --> 40:21.743
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
SO THEY HAD THE BOMB.

40:21.780 --> 40:22.917
NO, THEY REALLY DID.

40:22.950 --> 40:25.510
THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A BOMB.
NO ONE KNEW IT WAS A BOMB.

40:39.770 --> 40:42.159
[engine rumbles loudly]

40:45.140 --> 40:47.961
[engine sputtering
and knocking]

40:58.790 --> 41:01.782
