"Going out for a meal
isn't just about the food,
it's about the experience."

23:15.089 --> 23:18.092
[chuckles] And
singing clearly enhances
the Pop's experience.

23:18.135 --> 23:19.441
-Agreed.
-Mmm-hmm.

23:19.485 --> 23:20.921
Toni, thank you so much

23:20.964 --> 23:22.705
for dropping in
on such short notice.

23:23.837 --> 23:26.927
Also, what, pray tell,
is in that bag?

23:26.970 --> 23:31.018
The most adorable baby jeans
from Old Navy you've ever seen.

23:31.061 --> 23:32.585
-[Veronica gasping]
-[chuckles]

23:32.628 --> 23:34.282
-And thanks for asking me.
-[bag rustling]

23:34.325 --> 23:36.980
I thought
it would induce labor,
but no such luck.

23:37.024 --> 23:38.460
[both chuckle]

23:38.504 --> 23:40.549
-[Toni] Bye.
-Bye.

23:40.593 --> 23:43.857
So, Xandra, do we have a deal?

23:43.900 --> 23:45.728
Almost.

23:45.772 --> 23:48.601
The creative is there,
but now I need to see
your books and finances.

23:48.644 --> 23:51.952
Everything from the last...

23:51.995 --> 23:53.257
twenty years.

23:53.301 --> 23:58.132
Sure. I can make that happen.

24:03.311 --> 24:04.355
[sighs]

24:04.399 --> 24:06.401
[sniffles]

24:06.445 --> 24:07.968
[crying] Mom...

24:10.753 --> 24:12.668
[crying softly]

24:18.152 --> 24:20.154
What are you doing
in Riverdale?

24:21.460 --> 24:23.810
-How did you even know?
-Mmm.

24:23.853 --> 24:25.899
A mother always knows.

24:27.509 --> 24:30.773
When I heard
you had disappeared,

24:30.817 --> 24:35.125
I had a hunch you might
find your way to Riverdale,

24:35.169 --> 24:36.475
Ms. Newmar.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.218
What happened, Josie?

24:48.574 --> 24:51.054
When I got your call
with the news about Dad,

24:51.098 --> 24:52.665
I was in Berlin,

24:54.014 --> 24:56.146
seconds from
stepping onto a stage

24:56.190 --> 25:00.194
in a stadium
filled with 80,000 people.

25:02.022 --> 25:05.025
-[Josie] Mom? What's going on?
-[people cheering]

25:05.068 --> 25:10.334
[Sierra] I just got word.
Your dad passed away, baby.

25:10.378 --> 25:13.686
[voice shaking] Um,
it was sudden. A heart attack.

25:16.036 --> 25:18.168
Oh, my God. Mom.

25:18.212 --> 25:22.477
[voice shaking] I'm in Berlin,
in the middle of a world tour.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.435
[Sierra] I know,

25:24.479 --> 25:25.872
and that's why I don't
want you to worry
about anything.

25:25.915 --> 25:28.744
We'll meet up right after.

25:28.788 --> 25:30.746
[Sierra] It'll go by
in a flash.

25:35.751 --> 25:38.624
[crying hysterically]

25:41.627 --> 25:42.889
[Josie] After that call,

25:42.932 --> 25:45.544
I... couldn't perform.

25:45.587 --> 25:49.548
I just turned around
and walked away
from everything.

25:49.591 --> 25:52.986
And you came
to Riverdale. [chuckles]

25:53.029 --> 25:55.118
I hadn't been back in years.

25:55.162 --> 25:58.687
Uh... I just thought
I could disappear here.

26:00.776 --> 26:02.169
Like in high school.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.649
Josie, I...

26:05.912 --> 26:08.001
I brought your father's ashes.

26:08.044 --> 26:10.046
[both sigh]

26:10.090 --> 26:11.395
His last request

26:11.439 --> 26:14.094
was that they be scattered
around the country.

26:14.137 --> 26:16.705
All the little spots
he toured and loved.

26:17.706 --> 26:19.099
Sounds about right.

26:20.796 --> 26:22.232
And that's not all.

26:24.670 --> 26:28.804
Some songs he wrote
or re-orchestrated

26:28.848 --> 26:30.937
but never got a chance
to record.

26:46.300 --> 26:48.607
[cries softly]

26:48.650 --> 26:50.739
-[Melody] Val?
-Hey.

26:50.783 --> 26:52.959
Do you have a minute to talk?

26:53.002 --> 26:54.525
Sure, Mel. What's up?

26:54.569 --> 26:59.269
Well, [sighs] I've been
thinking a lot about Josie

26:59.313 --> 27:02.011
and how
she didn't do right by us.

27:03.186 --> 27:05.928
And how I wanna
do right by you, Valerie.

27:05.972 --> 27:09.453
But that means
being honest with each other.

27:09.497 --> 27:14.763
I don't think we'll be
making Summer Storm
into a movie anytime soon.

27:14.807 --> 27:18.680
-What happened?
-Tyler Perry wants
a star to play the lead.

27:18.724 --> 27:22.379
I mean, that makes sense.

27:22.423 --> 27:24.686
And of course,
if it means your movie's
gonna get made,

27:24.730 --> 27:26.079
I wouldn't want
to hold you back.

27:26.906 --> 27:29.125
I told him no.

27:29.169 --> 27:31.301
-What do you mean "no"?
-[Melody chuckles]

27:31.345 --> 27:32.868
I just sent Tyler an email

27:32.912 --> 27:35.654
that said I wasn't interested

27:35.697 --> 27:38.700
in making
Summer Storminto a movie

27:38.744 --> 27:40.397
[chuckling] unless
it starred you.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.836
Val, the role is yours.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.534
We'll get it done, Valerie.

27:46.577 --> 27:50.277
The two of us together.
The right way. [chuckles]

27:50.320 --> 27:53.846
-[chuckles]
-[cell phone ringing]

27:54.760 --> 27:56.544
Oh, is that Josie again?

27:56.587 --> 27:57.850
It's her mom.

27:59.329 --> 28:02.158
Well, I've dug
through your books,

28:02.202 --> 28:05.727
and, um, first off,
we literally need
to re-price everything.

28:05.771 --> 28:10.384
I think
bringing prices up-to-date
is totally doable, right?

28:10.427 --> 28:11.515
[sighing] Yeah.

28:11.559 --> 28:13.735
And then there's the milkshake.

28:13.779 --> 28:15.694
Oh, it's divinity in a glass.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.696
You're losing money on them.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.741
However, if we
adjust the recipe

28:19.785 --> 28:22.918
to replace real milk
with instant milk,

28:22.962 --> 28:24.180
we can save a ton of money.

28:24.224 --> 28:26.835
Pop's milkshakes
are our signature product

28:26.879 --> 28:28.750
developed by
my great-great-grandfather.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.186
I can't change the recipe.

28:30.230 --> 28:32.188
Girl, relax.
It is just a milkshake.

28:32.232 --> 28:37.237
Uh, Alexandra,
you may not know this,

28:37.280 --> 28:41.371
but Pop's started off
selling one thing:
chocolate milkshakes.

28:41.415 --> 28:43.678
Hence the name
Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.158
That was back when this was

28:45.201 --> 28:48.335
the first and only
Black-owned business in town.

28:48.378 --> 28:49.728
It was open 24/7.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.904
A safe place for people like us

28:51.947 --> 28:54.210
when those were few
and far between.

28:54.254 --> 28:56.125
So no,
it's not "just a milkshake,"

28:56.169 --> 28:58.562
and this isn't
"just a business."

28:58.606 --> 29:00.260
It's a legacy.

29:00.303 --> 29:02.523
And I can't give that up
for a bottom line.

29:05.961 --> 29:09.878
This doesn't
feel right anymore. Sorry.

29:09.922 --> 29:14.056
[clicks tongue] Well, Veronica,
I'm assuming you're prepared

29:14.100 --> 29:16.885
for me to withdraw my money
from your portfolios ASAP.

29:16.929 --> 29:19.235
If that's what you wanna do.

29:19.279 --> 29:23.544
But the banks are closed
so you'll have to wait
until tomorrow.

29:23.587 --> 29:25.851
See you bright and early.

29:27.461 --> 29:29.202
[sighs softly]

29:29.245 --> 29:31.291
[Valerie] Thought
you'd be here.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.556
What are you guys doing here?

29:35.599 --> 29:37.166
Your mom called us.

29:37.210 --> 29:40.082
-We're so sorry
about your dad, Josie.
-[sighs]

29:40.126 --> 29:41.518
Why didn't you tell us?

29:41.562 --> 29:43.129
If we'd have known, Josie,

29:43.172 --> 29:46.262
we would have never had said
any of those things to you.

29:46.306 --> 29:47.786
It's okay, Mel.

29:49.831 --> 29:52.312
You both were 100% right.

29:55.837 --> 29:59.928
You know, sometimes I think

29:59.972 --> 30:05.499
watching my dad
spend his entire career
just outside of the spotlight

30:05.542 --> 30:10.852
is why I became so obsessed
with getting it for myself.

30:10.896 --> 30:13.072
[crying]

30:13.115 --> 30:16.292
[voice breaking]
But now I would give anything

30:16.336 --> 30:19.426
[sobs] to play with him
just one more time...

30:19.469 --> 30:21.341
[sobbing]

30:22.168 --> 30:25.040
With you guys one more time.

30:26.389 --> 30:28.348
-[Josie sniffling]
-Then let's do it, Josie.

30:29.175 --> 30:30.524
That's why we came.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.309
To tell you...

30:33.353 --> 30:36.269
if you still wanna record
that song together,
we're totally down.

30:37.792 --> 30:40.142
[crying]

30:40.186 --> 30:43.450
Oh, my gosh.
[sniffles] That's amazing.

30:44.799 --> 30:46.018
[both] What?

30:46.061 --> 30:48.107
Nothing, nothing. I just--

30:48.150 --> 30:49.848
How would you feel

30:49.891 --> 30:53.199
about playing
a one-night-only concert?

30:53.242 --> 30:57.986
That would be incredible,
Josie, but what's the occasion?

30:58.030 --> 31:00.249
You guys giving me another shot

31:00.293 --> 31:04.645
makes me think that
maybe some other people
might deserve one, too.

31:06.516 --> 31:08.736
[Archie] Josie,
Melody and Valerie.

31:08.779 --> 31:11.217
[chuckles] I feel like
I'm in sophomore year again.

31:11.260 --> 31:13.219
-[Josie, Melody and Val laugh]
-What's going on, guys?

31:13.262 --> 31:15.003
-Hi, Archie.
-Hey, Archie.

31:15.047 --> 31:17.658
We're gonna help you
and the gang save Riverdale.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.878
Are you sure? I mean,
I know you didn't exactly--

31:19.921 --> 31:21.183
[shushes] Please.

31:21.227 --> 31:23.011
When a superstar
offers to help,

31:23.055 --> 31:25.231
you don't try
to talk them out of it.

31:25.274 --> 31:27.059
-[Melody chuckles]
-So what are you guys thinking?

31:27.102 --> 31:30.540
Well, we're thinking
a one-night-only

31:30.584 --> 31:32.673
Josie and the Pussycats
reunion concert.

31:32.716 --> 31:34.109
At the Whyte Wyrm.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.981
With all the proceeds
going to benefit a fund

31:36.024 --> 31:38.287
-to reincorporate
the former town of Riverdale.
-[Melody] Mmm-hmm.

31:38.331 --> 31:41.247
Josie and the Pussycats
reunited.

31:42.596 --> 31:46.382
If that doesn't save Riverdale,
nothing will.

31:53.085 --> 31:55.478
Toni, how overdue are you?

31:55.522 --> 31:57.219
A week [sighs],

31:57.263 --> 31:59.743
but I thought
it'd be good for the baby
to see the Cats live.

31:59.787 --> 32:01.484
Plus I wouldn't miss this.

32:02.616 --> 32:05.619
[clears throat]
Dr. Curdle Jr.? Hey.

32:05.662 --> 32:07.229
Did someone die?

32:07.273 --> 32:10.667
-No, Ms. Cooper.
I'm a huge Josie fan.
-We both are.

34:47.041 --> 34:49.739
Dodger Stadium, the Apollo.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.915
Whoo! [laughs]

34:51.959 --> 34:55.919
But there is no better spot
to play music than here.

34:55.963 --> 34:57.834
Riverdale nourishes artists

34:57.878 --> 35:01.577
like myself
and Valerie and Melody,

35:01.621 --> 35:04.450
and heck, even Jughead Jones.

35:07.235 --> 35:11.631
So, this next song is something

35:11.674 --> 35:15.548
my dad wanted
to hear me perform.

35:15.591 --> 35:19.117
It's originally sung
by one of his favorite artists.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.335
Nina Simone.

35:20.988 --> 35:22.250
This is for him.

Toni?

37:25.417 --> 37:26.722
I'm sorry, Josie.
I think I'm having my baby.

37:27.288 --> 37:28.811
Oh, crap.

37:28.855 --> 37:30.552
Um, okay. Uh,

37:30.596 --> 37:32.380
is there a doctor in the house?

37:32.424 --> 37:35.253
-I'm a doctor.
-I can do it.

37:35.296 --> 37:36.471
We prepared for a home birth,

37:36.515 --> 37:38.081
I just need
another pair of hands.

37:38.125 --> 37:40.649
-I'll do it.
-[Fogarty] Let's go.
Go, go, go.

37:40.693 --> 37:41.911
[Cheryl] Excuse me. Excuse me.

37:45.350 --> 37:46.873
[sighs]

37:46.916 --> 37:48.962
[Alexandra] Well, as exciting
as a random birth

37:49.005 --> 37:51.747
in the back of a diner is,
not to mention the coincidence

37:51.791 --> 37:55.316
of crossing paths with Josie
in Riverdale,

37:55.360 --> 37:58.363
my mind naturally turns back
to business,

37:58.406 --> 38:00.800
-as always.
-Oh, really?

38:00.843 --> 38:03.324
Well, Josie's little speech
got me thinking.

38:03.368 --> 38:06.849
With her celebrity endorsement
of Pop's,

38:06.893 --> 38:10.375
a franchise seems
like an even more
lucrative prospect.

38:10.418 --> 38:13.508
We're not changing
the milkshake recipe,
Alexandra.

38:13.552 --> 38:16.294
Pop's original milkshake recipe
and all.

38:17.512 --> 38:19.166
[Melody sighing]
Typical Riverdale.

38:19.209 --> 38:22.909
The Pussycats always
getting upstaged by something.

38:22.952 --> 38:25.346
Better a new baby
than a dead body.

38:25.390 --> 38:27.305
Still, it felt pretty great

38:27.348 --> 38:28.915
performing together again,
didn't it?

38:28.958 --> 38:30.395
[exhales] Agreed.

38:30.438 --> 38:31.961
Well, would you ladies

38:32.005 --> 38:34.442
ever consider going on tour
with me?

38:34.486 --> 38:36.836
I wanna
drive around the country

38:36.879 --> 38:38.794
and visit
all the small, cool places

38:38.838 --> 38:42.058
my dad played.
To honor his final wish.

38:43.451 --> 38:45.714
-What do you say?
-Intriguing.

38:45.758 --> 38:47.020
But, wait. What? Would we be

38:47.063 --> 38:49.022
like your opening act
or something?

38:49.065 --> 38:51.285
No, all three of us
would be headlining.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.591
I can't believe this.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.071
I mean...

38:55.115 --> 38:59.075
I have to talk to Alan
about a lot of things,

38:59.119 --> 39:01.469
including the fact that
I'm not ready to get married.

39:01.513 --> 39:03.471
-Wait. What?
-I'll fill you in later.

39:03.515 --> 39:05.168
[Melody scoffs]

39:05.212 --> 39:07.345
But, Josie, I'm in.

39:07.954 --> 39:09.651
Yes. Yes.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.873
Melody?

39:13.916 --> 39:14.917
[chuckles]

39:14.961 --> 39:16.528
I mean, I...

39:16.571 --> 39:18.138
I have to talk
to Nancy about it,

39:18.181 --> 39:20.619
but I mean, now that my movie's
on the back burner,

39:20.662 --> 39:22.403
I guess it could
kind of be like a book tour.

39:22.447 --> 39:24.362
-Absolutely.
-[Melody laughs]

39:24.405 --> 39:26.407
-Are we doing this?
-Yes.

39:26.451 --> 39:27.539
-[Melody] Okay.
-Yes!

39:27.582 --> 39:29.454
[all laughing]

39:32.674 --> 39:35.155
-Well?
-It's a boy.

39:35.198 --> 39:36.156
[gasps]

39:36.199 --> 39:37.984
[all exclaiming]

39:39.246 --> 39:41.422
Finally, some good news
in this crazy town.

39:48.168 --> 39:50.213
[Kevin] Not gonna lie,
Josie,
we were

39:50.257 --> 39:52.215
kind of hoping you'd stay
and be Riverdale High's
new music teacher.

39:52.259 --> 39:55.218
[chuckles] Uh,
my destiny lies elsewhere.

39:55.262 --> 39:56.698
Have an amazing tour, Josie.

39:56.742 --> 39:58.483
And I'm gonna call you, okay?

39:58.526 --> 40:00.920
And I'm gonna
live vicariously through you.

40:00.963 --> 40:02.312
Deal.

40:02.356 --> 40:04.358
But you guys should come out
and see me sometime.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.925
We will 100%, Josie.

40:05.968 --> 40:08.406
Especially if we
can get backstage passes.

40:08.449 --> 40:10.146
Uh, hell yes, you can.

40:10.190 --> 40:12.540
Look who came to say bye.

40:12.584 --> 40:16.414
Oh, my God.

40:16.457 --> 40:19.025
What is this
cutie-patootie's name?

40:19.460 --> 40:20.722
Tony.

40:20.766 --> 40:23.682
Anthony. After my grandfather.

40:23.725 --> 40:25.553
Congratulations again, Toni.

40:25.597 --> 40:28.469
Fangs. Kevin.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.558
He's really beautiful.

40:30.602 --> 40:31.907
[chuckles]

40:33.909 --> 40:37.086
You know, Alan,
you don't have to come with us.

40:37.130 --> 40:39.306
I still love you, Val.

40:39.349 --> 40:42.048
I'm in it for the long haul,
married or not.

40:42.091 --> 40:44.833
In case
I haven't told you today,

40:44.877 --> 40:47.706
I'm crazy about you,
Alan Mayberry.

40:49.142 --> 40:52.101
See? Plenty of time.

40:52.145 --> 40:53.233
[sighs]

40:53.276 --> 40:54.713
God, I don't know how
I'm gonna handle

40:54.756 --> 40:57.019
being on the road
without you, Nance.

40:57.063 --> 40:58.717
You'll be fine.

40:58.760 --> 41:00.458
We'll check in every night.

41:01.546 --> 41:03.069
I know. I just...

41:05.680 --> 41:07.639
just not gonna
be the same,
you know.

41:11.381 --> 41:12.905
[Sweet Pea] Hey, Josie?

41:12.948 --> 41:15.342
-Hi.
-Can I talk to you
for a second?

41:15.385 --> 41:16.648
Uh, yeah.

41:19.172 --> 41:22.175
So I've been thinking
and, uh...

41:23.829 --> 41:26.962
is there any chance
that I can tag along with you?

41:27.006 --> 41:29.095
You know,
I'd pull my weight.
I could...

41:29.138 --> 41:32.272
-I could drive the bus,
or I could be your roadie.
-[Josie laughs]

41:32.315 --> 41:33.491
I could be your...

41:35.580 --> 41:36.842
I could be your anything.

41:40.367 --> 41:42.935
It'll be a tight squeeze,
but, yes.

41:42.978 --> 41:45.894
Great. I'll, uh,
I'll load my stuff.

41:48.680 --> 41:49.637
You almost ready, honey?

41:49.681 --> 41:51.117
I think so.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.336
Unless this town has
any more surprises for me.

41:53.380 --> 41:54.642
[man] Josie McCoy?

41:55.164 --> 41:56.426
Yes?

41:56.470 --> 41:57.863
My name is Toots Sweet.

41:57.906 --> 41:59.995
I am a musician
that toured with your father.

42:00.039 --> 42:02.345
We've always had
each other's backs.

42:02.389 --> 42:04.391
That's why I'm here.

42:04.434 --> 42:07.220
I was with Myles in New Orleans
before he passed.

42:08.656 --> 42:10.571
He was mixed in bad stuff.

42:10.615 --> 42:15.881
Debts, petty crimes,
even voodoo.

42:15.924 --> 42:18.840
Josie, I don't believe
your father died
of natural causes.

42:18.884 --> 42:21.887
Are you saying that
my father was murdered?

42:21.930 --> 42:24.454
I'm sorry, I realize
this must come as a shock.

42:24.498 --> 42:25.717
Mr. Sweet,

42:25.760 --> 42:27.196
we've lived long enough
in Riverdale

42:27.240 --> 42:29.459
to know that
when someone passes away,

42:29.503 --> 42:31.723
foul play
is always on the table.

42:35.509 --> 42:38.599
Well, I know where
the first stop on my tour
is gonna be.

42:39.165 --> 42:40.470
New Orleans.

42:40.514 --> 42:41.950
It is.

42:41.994 --> 42:43.212
Let's get the hell out of here

42:43.256 --> 42:44.692
before we run out of room
on the bus.

The story of three young women,
old friends who found their way

43:10.283 --> 43:12.938
back to each other
and who set off together

43:12.981 --> 43:16.942
towards magical,
musical mysteries unknown.

43:21.294 --> 43:24.514
Do yourself a favor
