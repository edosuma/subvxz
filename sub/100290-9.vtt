00:06.000 --> 00:08.160
PREVIOUSLY...

00:08.960 --> 00:09.800
Hi, Akel.

00:09.880 --> 00:10.960
I ship this already.

00:11.120 --> 00:13.520
#RaKel. Send.

00:15.640 --> 00:18.120
Holy mother of God!

00:18.200 --> 00:21.920
How about you become my sister wives?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.160
-Aw!
-He's so cute!

00:24.240 --> 00:25.560
Wake up!

00:26.480 --> 00:27.440
Stop that.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.840
JP?

00:30.840 --> 00:32.440
I don't agree with you.

00:32.520 --> 00:35.240
Akel deserves to stay in the game,
not Lucas.

00:35.320 --> 00:37.880
#YouOweMeOne.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.240
ALERT!

00:39.320 --> 00:40.160
Alert!

00:40.240 --> 00:42.840
We have decided to block...

00:43.920 --> 00:45.000
Fuck!

00:45.080 --> 00:46.200
BLOCKED

00:49.720 --> 00:51.120
Are you satisfied?

00:56.720 --> 00:58.320
No way!

01:02.000 --> 01:04.080
My name is Rafael, but in <i>The Circle,</i>

01:04.520 --> 01:06.560
I'm Ana Paula, my best friend.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.600
Circle, open Ana's photo.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.280
I love those boobs.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.680
I really want to talk to Ana.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.240
It's time to pretend I like everybody.

01:18.560 --> 01:21.000
Drum roll, please!

01:22.000 --> 01:22.880
Nope.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.360
-Victory!
-Victory.

01:28.440 --> 01:29.520
I have no idea.

01:29.600 --> 01:30.800
Shit!

01:32.960 --> 01:34.680
Pizza...

01:36.720 --> 01:38.200
I wanna die!

01:42.800 --> 01:45.320
-Those sons of...
-That's heavy!

01:46.480 --> 01:47.720
Holy shit.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.280
She Fights is over for real.

01:55.360 --> 01:59.760
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:03.160 --> 02:05.760
<i>I can hardly wait for the decision.</i>

02:05.840 --> 02:08.920
<i>Whoever gets blocked can say bye-bye</i>
<i>to the prize of 300,000 reais.</i>

02:10.760 --> 02:12.760
So, having made the decision,

02:13.160 --> 02:15.720
I would like to announce it
to the group, okay?

02:15.800 --> 02:16.880
Send.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.520
Circle, message.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.840
This moment is all yours.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.120
Good luck.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.520
ALERT!

02:25.600 --> 02:27.480
-Alert.
-Alert. It's time.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.560
"The influencers
have made their decision."

02:30.640 --> 02:32.040
Oh, no.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.840
I think it's me.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.840
The person we've decided to block is...

02:44.560 --> 02:45.400
It's me.

03:00.320 --> 03:03.880
My heart can beat again.
Thank you, Lord!

03:11.000 --> 03:13.800
Gosh, they took away my doc.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.640
AKEL HAS BEEN BLOCKED FROM <i>THE CIRCLE</i>

03:16.000 --> 03:20.200
I played, I had fun.
I didn't want this experience to end.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.040
I didn't want Akel to go.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.880
Akel's got a big mouth, stirs shit up.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.080
Akel being blocked

03:28.160 --> 03:30.360
weakens Lorayne.

03:32.680 --> 03:33.720
This is good for me.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.040
I liked it.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.080
It hurts...

03:43.320 --> 03:44.960
to block someone like that.

03:45.240 --> 03:48.920
But like my mother used to say,

03:49.200 --> 03:50.720
"Better them than me."

03:57.000 --> 03:59.160
ALERT!

03:59.240 --> 04:00.520
Alert!

04:00.600 --> 04:03.480
Circle, I've lost count
of how many alerts we had already.

04:04.520 --> 04:07.080
"Akel has been blocked from <i>The Circle."</i>

04:07.160 --> 04:10.760
Thanks for confirming it,
but I crossed him off my list already.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.360
"Before leaving,

04:13.760 --> 04:16.880
Akel can meet one player in person."

04:17.760 --> 04:18.840
Here we go.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.560
He might come here.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.560
He might go to JP.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.440
"Akel is on his way
to one of the apartments."

04:29.520 --> 04:31.240
I'm not ready for this.

04:31.320 --> 04:33.600
<i>Holy mother of God.</i>

04:34.440 --> 04:35.360
Doc,

04:35.440 --> 04:38.160
if you wanna knock on my door,
bring it on.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.880
If you show up here,
you'll see the state I'm in.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.680
My heart is beating fast.

05:07.160 --> 05:10.160
Oh, my God!

05:11.040 --> 05:13.360
Holy shit, you're real.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.480
My goodness.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.200
-Nice to meet you.
-Sorry.

05:18.280 --> 05:21.280
I look like I've been crying.
I cried like crazy.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.800
I know what you mean.
I feel the exact same way.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.320
You have no idea
how happy I am to meet you.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.880
Me too, dude. Lord help me.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.680
This game is crazy. Fuck.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.920
I have two things to tell you.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.440
One is good. The other one, not so much.

05:37.520 --> 05:38.600
Okay.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.720
The not so good one
is that I'm not a doctor.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.880
I suspected that from the beginning!
Go ahead.

05:45.960 --> 05:49.080
And I'm not 30. You can tell by my face.

05:49.160 --> 05:50.760
-I can't pass as a 30-year-old.
-No!

05:50.840 --> 05:53.000
I can't, right? Since the first day,

05:53.560 --> 05:58.000
I liked you so much that I wanted you
to keep me company in the game.

05:58.280 --> 06:01.320
I made a little doll of you.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.520
-I'm very happy...
-Damn!

06:03.600 --> 06:04.440
…to meet you.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.400
I'd never...

06:06.680 --> 06:08.120
go against my principles.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.280
Ray talked to me earlier.

06:10.720 --> 06:13.240
She said that she likes me

06:13.320 --> 06:15.160
and that she shipped RaKel.

06:15.240 --> 06:18.160
I stood my ground,
and she kind of took a step back.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.280
Since he isn't coming here anyway,

06:24.360 --> 06:26.560
it's time for bed, right, princess?

06:27.360 --> 06:28.600
In our first date chat,

06:28.680 --> 06:31.200
she asked me if I had "someone."

06:31.280 --> 06:33.600
And I told her, "Dude, I talk to Akel.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.880
I think he's very cute."

06:35.960 --> 06:38.480
-I told her that.
-That's crazy.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.240
Wow. I need to show you something, too.

06:41.320 --> 06:43.160
I also made a doll of you.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.320
No way. Don't just get any...

06:45.400 --> 06:48.360
-Here.
-A mermaid? It looks like me.

06:48.440 --> 06:51.480
The pink hair is different.
I'm not sure if it looks good.

06:51.560 --> 06:54.520
I call you Lolo. I couldn't figure out
how to pronounce your name.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.440
-It's hard.
-The Circle got used to it.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.000
I'm leaving in good spirits, happy.

06:59.080 --> 07:02.480
Because I can't imagine leaving here

07:02.560 --> 07:03.640
without kissing you.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.400
Oh, my God!

07:05.480 --> 07:06.920
Can you hear it?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.280
-Can you hear it?
-What?

07:08.360 --> 07:09.680
They're asking for a peck.

07:09.760 --> 07:13.360
Calm down, people.
That's not how it works, for God's sake.

07:13.440 --> 07:14.280
Just a peck.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.760
Thank you so much for coming over, really.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.400
From the bottom of my heart.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.440
I went for it.

07:29.520 --> 07:32.040
I'm flirty. We don't need to talk.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.560
Just be bold and cheerful.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.600
Good luck. Rock this thing.
I'm very happy to know...

07:36.960 --> 07:39.720
that you are real.
I wanna get to know you after this.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.240
Did the fact that I got close to Lolo,

07:42.320 --> 07:45.240
that I was so attached to her,
result in my elimination?

07:45.320 --> 07:48.120
Maybe, but I don’t regret it,
and I wouldn’t change it.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.320
Knock 'em dead, win this shit.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.240
-Get ready. Kisses, see ya.
-Okay.

08:02.360 --> 08:06.280
If I was just like I am in real life,

08:06.360 --> 08:08.400
I don't know if it'd be interesting.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.920
I think some people
wouldn't have approached me.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.080
Even though he was a catfish,

08:14.600 --> 08:19.000
he was a great friend, an ally...

08:19.440 --> 08:22.240
for whom I fought tooth and nail.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.400
And dude...

08:27.280 --> 08:28.120
I'm so happy.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.760
<i>How does one sleep after that?</i>

08:31.040 --> 08:34.200
Damn, today was drama after drama.

08:34.560 --> 08:36.640
Wake up, Marina.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.640
And keep an eye on <i>The Circle.</i>

08:38.720 --> 08:41.760
Nice Lo is no more, for real.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.560
<i>And while our little angels sleep,</i>

08:45.640 --> 08:48.640
<i>a new player sneaks in the next morning.</i>

09:01.160 --> 09:03.720
Holy shit, man.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.760
Awesome. This is so cool.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.480
My name is Renan, I'm 30 years old.

09:14.560 --> 09:17.640
I have a degree in Phys Ed,
a graduate degree in Physiology,

09:17.720 --> 09:19.680
and I'm a cryptocurrencies enthusiast.

09:22.920 --> 09:25.560
I consider myself a proactive person.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.520
Wanna go? Let's go.
People like this type of energy.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.000
The in-game Renan
will be the real-life Renan.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.680
The usual. That person is really me.

09:36.760 --> 09:39.480
And in the game, I'll adapt to people.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.880
<i>The Circle</i> is a big challenge for me.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.120
I express myself much better in person

09:45.200 --> 09:46.200
than via text.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.400
I'll have to be careful in this exchange,

09:48.480 --> 09:50.520
while I try to show emotion,

09:50.600 --> 09:52.440
while I try to be empathetic.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.520
Losing patience
is not part of my strategy.

09:54.600 --> 09:58.240
I'll be chill. "Calm down, guys."
I'll be the peacemaker. "Calm down."

10:00.680 --> 10:04.400
If somebody flirts with me,
I'll flirt back a little bit

10:04.480 --> 10:07.440
to help with the romantic vibe
people are creating,

10:07.520 --> 10:08.480
since this is a game.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.640
For those who only care about looks...

10:14.080 --> 10:16.560
Watch out. I'll show you
that I'm a lot more than that.

10:22.360 --> 10:23.720
This is to celebrate, right?

10:26.640 --> 10:28.040
"Welcome to <i>The Circle."</i>

10:29.680 --> 10:31.680
"Set up your profile." Let's go.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.480
Circle, open that photo...

10:36.040 --> 10:37.520
in the car, shirtless.

10:38.160 --> 10:42.000
I picked this photo
because it's more about the smile,

10:42.080 --> 10:46.600
rather than an athletic,
shirtless man stereotype.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.840
It can help, but it's not a priority.

10:48.920 --> 10:51.560
Circle, add this photo to my profile.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.920
Very nice. I like it. "Age."

10:55.720 --> 10:58.000
I'm 30 years old,

10:58.080 --> 11:01.280
but as a strategy, here in my profile

11:01.360 --> 11:03.320
I'm gonna be 26.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.440
"Relationship status."

11:06.520 --> 11:08.960
I've been in a relationship
for over three years,

11:09.040 --> 11:12.440
but as a strategy here,
I prefer being single.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.680
"About me."

11:14.760 --> 11:17.320
I'm gonna say I'm an athlete,

11:18.280 --> 11:19.640
a Capricorn,

11:20.480 --> 11:23.240
and a cryptocurrencies enthusiast.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.880
#BeYourBestSelfEveryDay.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.760
Circle, post my profile.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.240
ALERT!

11:33.600 --> 11:34.640
Alert.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.800
"You must prepare a special breakfast

11:38.880 --> 11:41.640
for one of the female players."

11:42.560 --> 11:45.560
"Check the players' profiles
to make your choice."

11:48.480 --> 11:50.200
Circle, open Ana's profile.

11:51.440 --> 11:53.160
"Feminist and writer.

11:53.240 --> 11:57.080
I like men a lot, but that doesn't stop me
from going both ways."

11:58.960 --> 12:00.440
"Lorayne, 22 years old,

12:00.520 --> 12:02.800
single, Virgo countryside girl..."

12:03.120 --> 12:04.320
Nice, I like it.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.800
I think we can get along,
have a nice talk.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.320
Holy shit.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.280
Dude, what's with that photo?

12:12.880 --> 12:14.720
Hold on, I'm gonna try to do it, too.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.600
"Raised on <i>tacacá </i>and <i>açaí."</i>

12:18.040 --> 12:20.400
I have no idea what <i>tacacá </i>is.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.240
"Don't pull my weave."

12:23.280 --> 12:24.640
Very nice.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.240
"Made in the Manaus Industrial Zone."

12:27.920 --> 12:29.360
I like creative people. Nice.

12:30.720 --> 12:33.480
I'm gonna gift somebody right away.
I think that's cool.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.560
The problem is,
we only get to know each other

12:36.640 --> 12:37.800
through our profiles.

12:37.880 --> 12:40.040
So, I think I'm gonna pick...

12:41.280 --> 12:44.600
somebody who I relate to
the most, energy-wise.

12:45.320 --> 12:48.160
<i>Besides being a complete stud,</i>
<i>can he also cook?</i>

12:55.280 --> 12:56.560
ALERT!

12:56.640 --> 13:00.160
-Whoa!
-Whoa there! The alerts have started!

13:00.240 --> 13:02.360
Not this early in the morning!

13:02.440 --> 13:04.400
I haven't even brewed the coffee.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.840
For the love of God,
I hope it's not a blocking.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.080
-Whoa!
-What the hell?

13:11.160 --> 13:13.960
"A new player has entered <i>The Circle."</i>

13:14.360 --> 13:16.640
For Christ's sake...

13:16.960 --> 13:18.680
Is it a man?

13:19.040 --> 13:21.080
Who might this fighter be?

13:22.600 --> 13:27.400
"He is preparing a surprise
for one of you."

13:28.200 --> 13:29.040
Only one?

13:29.120 --> 13:31.440
He started with a lot of reassurance.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.440
I'll add some eggs, orange juice,

13:34.520 --> 13:35.640
roses, a note...

13:35.720 --> 13:37.240
If it's a date, then I want it.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.960
Whoa! Renan.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.480
Open Renan's profile.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.480
Why do you have your tits out?

13:46.760 --> 13:50.080
Jesus Christ!

13:55.760 --> 13:57.080
I want him.

13:57.160 --> 14:01.320
"Cryptocurrencies enthusiast."

14:01.400 --> 14:03.640
What the hell is that?

14:03.720 --> 14:05.280
A typical bro.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.040
Crypto as in kryptonite?

14:07.120 --> 14:09.400
Inside the car, no shirt on.

14:09.480 --> 14:13.840
One playmaker is out,
another one is in for the boy's team.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.400
He looks gay to me.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.720
Like those gay jocks, you know?

14:22.800 --> 14:24.720
Those who wear a polo shirt to the club.

14:24.800 --> 14:28.080
It's a good profile. He looks...

14:28.360 --> 14:29.320
Smart.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.600
Better than any food I've ever cooked.1

14:32.600 --> 14:34.280
<i>I wouldn't post that on Instagram.</i>

14:34.360 --> 14:36.320
He and Luma can be...

14:37.000 --> 14:38.240
an official couple.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.760
Not official. They can have some fun.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.000
Look, Renan. Welcome.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.720
Do I want you to be here?

14:44.800 --> 14:47.680
No. But since you're here, welcome.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.680
Bring me a nice surprise.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.960
A card right here in the corner, right?

14:52.040 --> 14:53.480
Man...

14:53.560 --> 14:55.040
I think the least

14:55.400 --> 14:58.200
I should get right now is a surprise.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.360
<i>Who's going to eat this egg toast?</i>

15:01.440 --> 15:03.320
I hope it's for me.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.000
Whoa, come in.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.720
Is anybody there?

15:08.800 --> 15:09.680
Hello?

15:10.480 --> 15:12.720
Is Renan knocking on the door?

15:17.720 --> 15:19.920
Oh, my God.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.600
I did well. Positive thinking.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.400
This can't be serious.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.120
Whoa.

15:31.440 --> 15:34.720
Oh, Lord. Akel's body isn't even cold yet.
What's going on?

15:36.280 --> 15:38.720
Dude, this is so cute!

15:38.800 --> 15:41.320
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed. Jeez.

15:41.720 --> 15:42.680
Okay.

15:43.080 --> 15:44.720
There's a little card.

15:45.360 --> 15:49.600
"Good morning. A special breakfast
for the small-town princess.

15:49.920 --> 15:52.480
It's hard to please a Virgo.

15:52.560 --> 15:55.200
I hope I was successful.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.480
Kisses, Renan."

15:57.000 --> 15:59.520
I picked Lorayne

15:59.600 --> 16:02.280
because besides her great energy,

16:02.360 --> 16:06.520
she's someone I'd be attracted to,
someone I could talk to.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.240
Akel just left,

16:09.320 --> 16:11.240
and there's already another boy...

16:11.640 --> 16:13.040
hitting on me.

16:13.120 --> 16:16.000
<i>Yeah, it looks like Lorayne is moving on.</i>

16:18.440 --> 16:20.400
I don't think the surprise is for me.

16:20.760 --> 16:22.480
It must have gone to Lorayne.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.640
I'm really curious

16:29.720 --> 16:32.120
to know if she liked.

16:32.480 --> 16:35.120
Both the surprise and the breakfast.

16:35.200 --> 16:38.240
Circle, open private chat with Lorayne.

16:39.680 --> 16:42.480
"Renan has invited you to a private chat."

16:42.560 --> 16:45.560
Good morning, honey!

16:46.520 --> 16:49.560
The strategy is to make a connection.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.760
If we flirt, it should happen naturally.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.960
Circle, open chat with Renan.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.200
PRIVATE CHAT

16:56.280 --> 16:57.360
Message.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.200
Good morning. How are you?
So, did I do well?

17:02.280 --> 17:03.240
Send.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.000
Circle, message.

17:06.080 --> 17:08.320
If you think you can bribe me with food,

17:08.400 --> 17:11.040
you're absolutely right.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.440
Welcome, dude.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.520
Just so you know, <i>The Circle</i> is on fire.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.440
"People are skittish right now."

17:19.120 --> 17:21.920
Tell me more about it. #TellMeEverything.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.040
Circle, send.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.640
Okay, so he wants it straight.

17:25.720 --> 17:27.560
I'm gonna give it to him straight.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.080
Circle, message.

17:30.160 --> 17:35.160
Considering everything that happened,
JP is my main concern right now.

17:35.240 --> 17:39.440
I hate phonies. And that punk
has proven that his game is dirty.

17:39.520 --> 17:43.880
I think Marina and Dumaresq
play a fair game.

17:43.960 --> 17:44.920
Send.

17:46.320 --> 17:49.200
If she thinks Marina and Dumaresq
play a fair game,

17:49.280 --> 17:50.880
it's because they're her allies.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.120
Circle, message.

17:52.640 --> 17:56.000
Thanks for the information.
That will help me a lot, for sure.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.480
If you hate phonies, #WeAreInThisTogether.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.320
Kisses. Until we talk again.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.840
Circle, send.

18:03.440 --> 18:04.960
Circle, message.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.720
You can count on me. #ILovedTheBreakfast.

18:07.800 --> 18:08.840
Send.

18:11.000 --> 18:11.840
Score.

18:13.480 --> 18:16.840
I really hope he takes
the information I gave him

18:16.920 --> 18:21.600
into consideration
when he makes his decisions.

18:21.680 --> 18:22.800
Gotta be watchful.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.200
<i>I like that. He just got here</i>
<i>and wants all the privileges.</i>

18:35.280 --> 18:37.120
"The newsfeed has been updated."

18:37.200 --> 18:38.520
Okay, let's go.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.960
Circle, open my newsfeed.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.240
NEWSFEED

18:42.320 --> 18:45.600
"Before leaving, Akel left a message."

18:46.080 --> 18:48.760
I wonder if this message will have

18:48.840 --> 18:50.240
any advice.

18:50.320 --> 18:53.120
I wonder if Akel was a catfish.

18:53.200 --> 18:57.240
I don't think so. I think
I'm gonna fall in love with him.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.360
Let's see what the <i>mineirinho</i> has to say.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.560
Circle, play Akel's video.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.880
Akel, what did you say, huh?

19:09.960 --> 19:11.440
Oh, my God...

19:12.520 --> 19:13.480
It's time.

19:15.360 --> 19:16.320
Hey, everybody.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.800
Nice to meet you. I'm Akel, in the flesh.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.200
<i>With a few distinctions. I'm not a doctor.</i>

19:22.280 --> 19:25.040
I even pass out when I see blood.
I can't handle that stuff.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.840
<i>And I'm not 30 years old.</i>

19:26.920 --> 19:30.320
Look at this baby face.
I'm 20 years old. I'm in my prime.

19:30.840 --> 19:34.640
He's 20! Oh, my God!

19:35.080 --> 19:36.760
I kissed a child.

19:36.840 --> 19:39.000
But damn, he lied by ten years.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.120
Ten years is a lot.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.200
This game was nuts.

19:43.280 --> 19:46.520
<i>Some people say different things</i>
<i>in different chats,</i>

19:46.600 --> 19:48.920
<i>but in the end,</i>
<i>they want your head on a spike.</i>

19:49.000 --> 19:50.880
It's a dirty game. Be careful!

19:50.960 --> 19:52.840
That's an important message.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.320
If that hint was directed at me, bro...

19:56.040 --> 19:57.200
I didn't get it.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.880
Well, I'm rooting...

19:58.960 --> 20:01.360
<i>for you, Lolo, as expected.</i>

20:01.440 --> 20:02.280
<i>Knock 'em dead.</i>

20:02.720 --> 20:05.040
Skyrocket, poof! Go, Araxá!

20:05.120 --> 20:09.200
You big fool!
Why weren't you yourself in here?

20:10.160 --> 20:13.160
Nice warning. I'll keep my eyes peeled.
Thank you, Akel.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.760
Your issue was with JP.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.480
So, if I'm friends with JP,

20:18.840 --> 20:20.120
I'm good.

20:20.200 --> 20:25.120
Skyrocket out of <i>The Circle!</i>

20:25.480 --> 20:27.200
Thanks for rooting for me.

20:27.280 --> 20:30.280
I'll do my best to win this

20:30.360 --> 20:32.440
for the both of us. And that's it.

20:32.920 --> 20:36.520
<i>Well, Lorayne, it's high time</i>
<i>for you to be more flexible in this game.</i>

20:45.480 --> 20:47.840
<i>Because what's not lacking here</i>
<i>is flexible players.</i>

20:47.920 --> 20:50.920
Children, eat your vegetables.

20:51.400 --> 20:55.200
Oh, I feel so alone!

20:56.480 --> 20:57.480
Circle,

20:57.560 --> 21:01.640
open the She Fights Chat!

21:02.880 --> 21:06.240
"Dumaresq has invited you
to the She Fights Chat."

21:06.320 --> 21:08.000
Oh, my God.

21:08.360 --> 21:10.400
Dumaresq, you better stop.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.680
Lorayne was in last place,

21:12.760 --> 21:15.320
so it must have been a strategy.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.680
Oh, sweet Jesus.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.280
SHE FIGHTS

21:19.360 --> 21:21.760
Circle, message.

21:22.040 --> 21:26.680
Good morning, girls!

21:26.760 --> 21:30.600
We have a new member!

21:31.040 --> 21:34.120
Come on in, Ana!

21:34.480 --> 21:35.800
Send!

21:36.480 --> 21:38.280
"Come on in, Ana!"

21:39.800 --> 21:40.840
Boring.

21:40.920 --> 21:43.400
My suspicion radar is like...

21:45.000 --> 21:46.640
Circle, message.

21:46.720 --> 21:47.800
Good morning, girls.

21:47.880 --> 21:51.200
I went all Matrix on the blocking.
#Relieved.

21:51.280 --> 21:54.280
Let's be watchful, girls.
<i>Fakery</i> is prevailing.

21:54.360 --> 21:55.360
Send.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.000
It really is prevailing because...

21:57.520 --> 21:59.040
I'm being fake to you.

21:59.120 --> 22:01.560
That wasn't for me, right?
We've talked already.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.680
Girl...

22:03.400 --> 22:04.520
You're next.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.320
I'm gonna talk about the new player.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.600
Circle, message.

22:07.680 --> 22:10.000
It's always nice to be among women,

22:10.080 --> 22:13.320
but it's also nice
when a hottie joins the group!

22:13.400 --> 22:14.440
Exclamation mark.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.800
What do you think about Renan?

22:16.880 --> 22:19.040
Gosh, Ana!

22:19.640 --> 22:21.200
Dirty girl.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.640
Circle, message!

22:24.080 --> 22:27.240
Renan is hot indeed.

22:27.320 --> 22:29.160
What about the surprise, huh?

22:29.680 --> 22:34.360
"I stayed home and even used moisturizer,
but he didn't show up."

22:35.400 --> 22:36.560
Circle, message.

22:36.640 --> 22:38.840
Did anyone receive that surprise?

22:38.920 --> 22:42.720
I was so naive,
waiting for breakfast in bed.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.760
Laugh emoji. Send.

22:46.520 --> 22:49.880
Just the fact that Ray
is in the group chat weighs...

22:50.240 --> 22:51.840
on whether...

22:52.200 --> 22:54.520
I'll share the information
about the breakfast.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.640
Because I consider him an ally,

22:57.320 --> 23:01.000
and I don't want him to know
about this yet.

23:01.680 --> 23:02.920
Circle, message.

23:03.320 --> 23:05.280
I still had boogers in my eyes...

23:05.360 --> 23:07.840
"...and waited for a strip tease,
but nothing happened.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.800
#Disappointment."

23:09.880 --> 23:12.800
There's no way that no one here
received that surprise.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.080
You better stop, girls.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.560
I hate lies,

23:18.000 --> 23:21.520
but in the game, with all the girls here,

23:21.960 --> 23:25.600
it's complicated to share this.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.520
If Lorayne was the one
who received the surprise,

23:28.880 --> 23:30.280
I understand.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.240
Because now she's leery of people,

23:32.320 --> 23:34.360
she doesn't know who to trust.

23:34.440 --> 23:37.480
Lorayne said she was waiting
with boogers in her eyes.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.920
Luma asked who received it.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.880
Ray didn't say a word.
Neither did Ana or Marina...

23:43.480 --> 23:45.280
Was it JP?

23:45.360 --> 23:46.920
Circle, message.

23:47.280 --> 23:52.400
But who received that surprise, after all?

23:52.480 --> 23:53.720
Was it JP?

23:53.800 --> 23:54.840
Send.

23:55.440 --> 23:57.080
Circle, message.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.720
Dumaresq, good thinking.

23:59.800 --> 24:03.960
Maybe Renan realized
that the men are a minority

24:04.040 --> 24:05.720
and gave JP the surprise.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.160
Send.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.240
Imagine JP saying he didn't get it.

24:10.320 --> 24:12.880
We'll be like, "What?

24:13.640 --> 24:15.040
Someone is lying!"

24:15.120 --> 24:16.680
Circle, message.

24:16.760 --> 24:18.480
JP is freaking lucky.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.560
Laugh emoji. Send.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.120
I'm thinking

24:22.200 --> 24:24.480
of 15 thousand ways

24:24.560 --> 24:28.360
people can find out I just lied.

24:28.440 --> 24:30.800
So, in my head, this can come...

24:31.440 --> 24:33.240
to light and...

24:34.160 --> 24:35.760
Circle, message.

24:35.840 --> 24:38.760
Lorayne, tell us.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.520
Did Akel visit you?

24:41.920 --> 24:43.520
"Did you guys kiss?"

24:44.080 --> 24:46.440
-You think?
-Is she going to say anything?

24:46.800 --> 24:49.920
Don't say anything! It's a trap!

24:50.880 --> 24:52.400
Circle, message.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.120
Oh, God. Yes, he came over.

24:54.200 --> 24:55.320
Laugh emoji.

24:55.400 --> 24:58.560
About the kiss, #ThatIsASecret.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.720
Laugh emoji. Send.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.080
<i>She's keeping secrets</i>

25:04.160 --> 25:06.160
<i>She's on the fence</i>

25:06.240 --> 25:08.920
Lorayne, Little Lorayne...

25:09.280 --> 25:13.520
You're not in a position
to be keeping secrets from us.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.760
Circle, message.

25:15.840 --> 25:18.760
It's always great talking to you here.

25:18.840 --> 25:21.880
Good morning to you all. #GirlPower.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.600
Kiss emoji and red heart emoji.

25:24.680 --> 25:25.680
Send.

25:26.680 --> 25:27.800
Circle, message.

25:27.880 --> 25:29.400
See you soon, girls.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.560
#LetsGetThem.

25:31.640 --> 25:32.680
Send.

25:33.040 --> 25:35.760
Once again, comma, thanks, Dumaresq.

25:35.840 --> 25:40.480
Kisses to you all!
Exclamation mark. Red heart emoji.

25:40.560 --> 25:41.640
Send.

25:43.080 --> 25:46.840
Mystery is in the air on <i>The Circle.</i>

25:47.280 --> 25:51.960
Who did Renan give the surprise to?

25:52.040 --> 25:54.920
The first chance I get, I'll ask,
"JP, what about the surprise?"

25:55.480 --> 25:56.320
Pow!

25:58.080 --> 26:01.760
<i>Will this secret ever be revealed?</i>

26:02.880 --> 26:05.320
Circle, open private chat with JP.

26:06.960 --> 26:09.120
"Renan has invited you to a private chat."

26:09.480 --> 26:12.320
Let's talk, let's get to know each other.
Welcome.

26:12.400 --> 26:15.320
Circle, open private chat with Renan.

26:16.160 --> 26:19.960
<i>The definition of "whatever"</i>
<i>has been updated.</i>

26:20.040 --> 26:22.920
Lorayne said JP was phony.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.160
But there are a lot of girls in the game.

26:25.240 --> 26:27.080
He's one of the few men left.

26:27.160 --> 26:30.160
My first strategy would be
to make a connection with him,

26:30.240 --> 26:33.320
since the men are the ones leaving.

26:33.400 --> 26:34.760
Circle, message.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.760
Hey JP, what's up?

26:36.840 --> 26:39.920
So, the women are dominating
around here? Circle, send.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Circle, message.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.880
Yeah, bro. The ladies have taken over.

26:44.960 --> 26:46.720
Laugh emoji with tears.

26:47.240 --> 26:50.520
What about that surprise?
Who did you send it to? Circle, send.

26:51.600 --> 26:53.800
If he sent the surprise to...

26:54.240 --> 26:55.880
one of my girls from the North,

26:55.960 --> 26:58.000
I wouldn't be too happy because...

26:58.720 --> 26:59.720
they're like...

27:00.560 --> 27:02.200
my sister wives, right?

27:02.560 --> 27:03.920
Circle, message.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.120
I came to strengthen the men's team.

27:06.200 --> 27:09.120
The surprise was a breakfast.
I made it for Lorayne.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.360
I think you get it.

27:10.440 --> 27:11.600
Circle, send.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.560
He sent her the breakfast and stuff.

27:13.640 --> 27:15.960
I think she talked about me,

27:16.040 --> 27:18.520
she must have told him
that I'm playing dirty.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.000
Circle, message.

27:20.360 --> 27:22.200
Did Lorayne say anything about me?

27:22.760 --> 27:24.520
Thinking emoji.

27:24.600 --> 27:26.000
Circle, send.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.640
Yes, JP, she did.
But I'm not gonna tell you.

27:31.720 --> 27:33.800
Let's see if he's gonna be honest.

27:34.560 --> 27:35.440
Not really.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.920
But she said good things
about Dumaresq and Marina.

27:39.480 --> 27:42.320
What did you think
of Akel being blocked? Circle, send.

27:43.280 --> 27:45.920
I applaud her for this attitude,

27:46.000 --> 27:49.960
for not wanting to make intrigues
and talk behind my back.

27:50.040 --> 27:52.000
Just so I don't create any intrigues,

27:52.360 --> 27:55.000
I rather not say anything,

27:55.080 --> 27:57.640
but hear what he has to say about them.

27:58.320 --> 27:59.720
Circle, message.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.560
Bro, Akel being blocked
was taken into consideration

28:02.640 --> 28:05.160
when Lorayne and I were influencers.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.080
Among all the players at the time,

28:07.160 --> 28:09.120
he was the least deserving to stay.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.360
But Lorayne and Akel were a couple.

28:11.440 --> 28:15.920
Anyway, because of that,
I think she holds a grudge against me.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.600
But life goes on.

28:17.880 --> 28:18.960
Send.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.880
"But Lorayne and Akel were a couple."

28:23.120 --> 28:24.440
I'm talking to the right guy.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.000
Circle, message.

28:26.240 --> 28:28.600
If she holds a grudge,
then she didn't reveal it yet.

28:28.680 --> 28:29.800
That's part of the game.

28:29.880 --> 28:32.280
#LifeGoesOn. Circle, send.

28:33.080 --> 28:34.680
There's always the chance

28:34.760 --> 28:37.920
that he might share real information.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.680
Something that she might have talked
to him about

28:41.760 --> 28:43.560
and asked him to keep a secret.

28:43.640 --> 28:44.840
We never know, right?

28:45.200 --> 28:46.520
Circle, message.

28:46.920 --> 28:48.280
So that's it, bro.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.520
Little by little,
you'll get to know who is who,

28:50.600 --> 28:52.760
and you'll make alliances
with the right people.

28:52.840 --> 28:55.480
We're playing fair,
and I hope you join this team.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.280
#LetsGetThem,

28:57.360 --> 28:59.280
#Welcome,

28:59.360 --> 29:00.960
#WeAreInThisTogether.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.400
She was the one
who talked about other people,

29:03.800 --> 29:07.120
I didn't even have to ask.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.200
She said, "Look, be careful with him."

29:09.280 --> 29:11.280
Was it because she's nice?

29:11.360 --> 29:14.520
<i>I don't know about nice,</i>
<i>but don't step on her toes.</i>

29:14.600 --> 29:17.720
There is no excuse for what you did.

29:17.800 --> 29:19.600
TWO-FACED

29:30.400 --> 29:32.000
ALERT!

29:33.120 --> 29:34.040
Oh, God.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.840
Alert!

29:36.920 --> 29:39.200
The alert gives me all kinds of fear.

29:39.680 --> 29:40.800
Ready to be alerted.

29:42.120 --> 29:46.240
"Renan was the last player
to enter <i>The Circle."</i>

29:46.320 --> 29:47.480
It's me. <i>Yo.</i>

29:47.560 --> 29:49.120
So? What about it?

29:50.320 --> 29:52.360
"The winner of the game

29:52.440 --> 29:53.880
is among you."

29:53.960 --> 29:55.640
No spots left.

29:56.800 --> 29:57.760
That's true.

29:57.840 --> 29:59.240
That makes me feel like...

30:00.840 --> 30:03.120
Let's celebrate!

30:05.600 --> 30:07.480
I even baked a cake to celebrate.

30:09.280 --> 30:11.440
Oops, I screwed up. No!

30:11.520 --> 30:14.040
Whoa! I've just understood the message!

30:14.120 --> 30:17.600
<i>I'm close to the final</i>

30:19.520 --> 30:20.920
Hell yeah!

30:24.240 --> 30:25.760
I dropped everything!

30:26.080 --> 30:27.680
PARTY

30:27.760 --> 30:29.800
-Party time!
-Party!

30:29.880 --> 30:31.600
-No way!
-Cool!

30:31.680 --> 30:33.080
-Party!
-What do you mean?

30:33.160 --> 30:35.720
Nice! Party is my middle name!

30:38.720 --> 30:40.720
"Sun, beach..."

30:40.800 --> 30:41.720
"...summer..."

30:41.800 --> 30:43.280
What does it mean?

30:43.360 --> 30:45.080
Did anybody say, "sun?"

30:47.360 --> 30:49.800
"That's right, inside the apartment."

30:50.280 --> 30:51.720
You can wear a bikini.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.400
I want to see the boys in Speedos!

30:55.400 --> 30:58.320
"Go to the door

30:58.400 --> 31:03.920
and get the items
that are waiting for you!"

31:04.000 --> 31:05.640
Hey! Wait for me, you brat!

31:05.720 --> 31:08.600
<i>Party, let's go</i>

31:08.680 --> 31:10.040
<i>There's a party today</i>

31:11.000 --> 31:13.960
Oh, my God!

31:14.040 --> 31:15.840
Holy...!

31:15.920 --> 31:17.840
Oh, my God!

31:22.800 --> 31:24.360
No way.

31:25.160 --> 31:29.800
There's a giant unicorn
coming through my door!

31:29.880 --> 31:31.200
Oh, my God!

31:31.680 --> 31:33.440
This is wonderful.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.000
I don't know what to do with it.

31:40.680 --> 31:42.600
I'm gonna get ready for this party.

31:42.680 --> 31:45.760
Excuse me, before my guests arrive.

31:46.280 --> 31:47.600
Let's put this sunblock on.

31:47.680 --> 31:50.120
Let's take care of ourselves, everybody.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.800
I'm ready.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.200
Hurry up, bro. Fill it up.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.120
I want to get in the pool.

32:01.200 --> 32:04.880
Gin and tonic.
That's what I'm talking about!

32:04.960 --> 32:07.040
Wave incoming!

32:09.600 --> 32:10.840
Yippee!

32:13.160 --> 32:16.200
Dude, what an awesome party.

32:17.400 --> 32:20.800
Yikes! The water is so cold!

32:20.880 --> 32:23.320
I'm very famous now, my dear.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.680
No way!

32:40.120 --> 32:41.520
I'm shook!

32:48.200 --> 32:49.400
The party's starting.

32:56.720 --> 32:57.720
Hey!

32:58.760 --> 32:59.680
Ouch!

33:26.320 --> 33:27.960
There's no one to kiss.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.160
I think I'm drunk!

33:53.840 --> 33:55.600
I'm a great dancer, man.

33:55.680 --> 33:57.120

34:03.480 --> 34:05.920
This is so cool!

34:06.000 --> 34:08.920

34:09.640 --> 34:11.880
Send that photo

That one is 100% me.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.240
#ByTheRiver.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.280
Because there's no beach
in the countryside.

34:17.360 --> 34:19.040
Laugh emoji. Send.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.200
Dude, you are all back
in the game, blondie.

34:23.280 --> 34:26.000
Guys, I'm shocked.

34:26.480 --> 34:28.960
She's super skinny. I did not expect that.

34:29.040 --> 34:32.240
We're not very close now.
I don't know if I should say anything.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.600
Circle. Wow, #NicePic.

34:35.040 --> 34:37.120
Winking face emoji. Send.

34:37.400 --> 34:40.520
Yikes! Renan's first message

34:40.800 --> 34:42.560
for an entire group is,

34:42.640 --> 34:44.920
"Wow, #NicePic?"

34:45.000 --> 34:48.440
Gosh. If there is one thing

34:48.520 --> 34:50.800
I really dislike

34:50.880 --> 34:53.000
is this whole hetero persona.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.760
Circle, select that photo

34:56.040 --> 34:58.400
of me at the beach with Tobias.

34:58.480 --> 35:01.400
Guys, Tobias is also enjoying the party.

35:01.760 --> 35:04.840
#PoolParty. #RaySlays.

Send.

35:07.480 --> 35:08.800

35:08.880 --> 35:11.360

35:12.160 --> 35:14.360
#RayBarks.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.480
"#RayBarks."

35:17.600 --> 35:19.760
Did you call me dog?

35:19.840 --> 35:21.280
Are you crazy?

35:21.360 --> 35:26.440
Circle, open the "Fierce" gallery.

35:27.160 --> 35:30.080
I'm going to use that one.
Caption for my photo...

35:30.800 --> 35:33.680
"Plastic cups, no more."

35:34.120 --> 35:35.320
Circle, send.

35:35.400 --> 35:36.840
Oh, I got it. Write it down.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.080
Circle, message.

35:38.160 --> 35:41.000
I was just doing the same thing
with my pineapple cup.

35:41.080 --> 35:43.480
"I was just doing the same thing..." How?

35:43.560 --> 35:46.480
Is his chest that big
for him to manage to do that?

35:49.040 --> 35:50.400
I can't even do that.

35:50.480 --> 35:53.360
Circle, I'm picking that photo

35:53.440 --> 35:55.920
where I'm holding a rod.

35:56.520 --> 35:57.760
Summer comes...

35:57.840 --> 36:00.360
"...summer goes, and I'm still hot."

36:00.640 --> 36:02.640
"#HoldTheRod."

36:03.240 --> 36:04.080
No thanks.

36:04.440 --> 36:05.960
Circle, open the "Hobbies" album.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.440
The first one, in white Speedo.

36:09.760 --> 36:10.840
I'm gonna use that.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.040
Caption for my photo...

36:12.600 --> 36:15.160
"Raise your hand if you like waterfalls."

36:15.480 --> 36:16.360
Send photo.

36:17.520 --> 36:19.120
Holy shit!

36:19.640 --> 36:21.560
JP, wow...

36:21.640 --> 36:23.040
Don't look, Nelson.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.960
Circle, zoom in.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.040
The dude...

36:38.200 --> 36:40.360
The dude shows his dick on TV.

36:44.920 --> 36:46.800
And he's wearing a life jacket...

36:47.600 --> 36:49.360
I see something there.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.280
When he posted the photo, I...

36:51.920 --> 36:53.520
Leave the photo zoomed in.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.160
No need to take it down.
Leave it zoomed in.

36:56.240 --> 36:59.000
Circle, open "Believe in Yourself" album.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.160
The one with her mom would be great.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.800
Circle, send this photo.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.800
That's quite a woman, Brazil.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.120
And her mom is gorgeous, too.

37:12.200 --> 37:13.360
All fancy.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.280
I want to use this comment
before everyone does.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.440
Circle, message.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.240
"The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree."

37:21.640 --> 37:23.200
Wow. Renan...

37:23.480 --> 37:25.840
He can't make a good comment, can he?

37:26.320 --> 37:29.080
Circle, select the first photo.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.960
Sea tigress.

37:33.840 --> 37:36.880
#FromMéierToCalifornia.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.200
Nice!

37:43.640 --> 37:46.080
She's incredible!

37:46.160 --> 37:48.280
Oh, my God!

37:48.360 --> 37:49.760
Circle, message.

37:50.160 --> 37:53.200
Oh, God. Someone bring me a napkin
because I'm drooling.

37:53.280 --> 37:54.880
That's my girl.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.960
#MyWoman. Send.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.040
Look at that.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.480
You two made up, huh?

38:01.320 --> 38:03.600
Circle, open the "Travel" album.

38:05.360 --> 38:06.920
I found the perfect photo.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.120
Circle, post the photo
where I'm laying on a pineapple.

38:11.280 --> 38:12.440
Come on over, guys!

38:12.520 --> 38:14.760
#PoolParty. #GoodVibes.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.120
Send.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.000
Circle, message.

38:19.440 --> 38:21.560
Renan, my man, you really know what to do.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.960
You seduced Lorayne with a breakfast,

38:25.040 --> 38:27.120
and now you want to seduce
the other girls.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.520
#SeductiveRenan.

38:30.520 --> 38:31.400
Send.

38:36.640 --> 38:39.400
Shit, now I'm fucked.

38:41.840 --> 38:44.240
The son of a bitch gave me away!

38:46.000 --> 38:48.520
I'm in shock!

38:48.600 --> 38:51.320
Lorayne didn't say anything!

38:51.400 --> 38:52.800
Lorayne lied!

38:53.320 --> 38:55.960
What a phony!

38:56.040 --> 38:57.680
Yeah, now I'm screwed.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.680
Circle, message.

38:59.760 --> 39:03.480
Lorayne, you're full of secrets.

39:03.800 --> 39:04.880
Send.

39:04.960 --> 39:07.520
Whoa!

39:08.200 --> 39:10.000
Yes!

39:10.080 --> 39:13.360
The masks are falling!

39:13.880 --> 39:17.520
Lorayne didn't say anything
because she doesn't trust the girls.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.240
Circle, message.

39:19.600 --> 39:22.520
Shoosh, JP. It was supposed
to be a secret. Laugh emoji.

39:22.600 --> 39:25.240
Dumaresq, Akel just left.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.600
I was feeling embarrassed. LOL. Send.

39:28.680 --> 39:31.400
What a pitiful excuse for an answer.

39:32.320 --> 39:34.320
She's tricky.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.040
Circle, message.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.600
#TruthBeingTold.

39:39.440 --> 39:42.040
And a laugh emoji. Send.

39:42.440 --> 39:44.360
I fucked up today.

39:44.440 --> 39:46.680
I have zero allies right now.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.880
Tomorrow can't come soon enough.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.600
This was the best party, no doubt.

39:53.680 --> 39:57.080
-Silence prevails.
-And the chat became silent.

39:58.320 --> 40:01.520
<i>For a good player, silence suffices.</i>

40:11.240 --> 40:13.680
ALERT!

40:13.760 --> 40:15.680
-Alert!
-Alert.

40:15.760 --> 40:18.560
Oh, my God!

40:18.640 --> 40:20.080
Gosh.

40:20.200 --> 40:24.240
My heart can't take another hit today.

40:26.360 --> 40:27.560
Finally.

40:28.040 --> 40:30.200
"It's time for the ratings."

40:35.600 --> 40:38.160
Now what? I'm eating.

40:39.920 --> 40:43.160
"Rank the players from favorite

40:43.240 --> 40:44.800
to least favorite."

40:44.880 --> 40:47.200
I just got here.
How am I supposed to do that?

40:47.280 --> 40:51.840
You need to captivate people
just like that, overnight.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.360
"Since he's a new player, Renan can rate,

40:55.440 --> 40:56.800
but cannot be rated."

40:56.880 --> 40:58.120
Whew!

41:02.880 --> 41:04.040
"Ratings."

41:04.120 --> 41:05.920
Circle, Dumaresq in first place.

41:06.800 --> 41:09.960
Because he got a great rate last time.

41:10.040 --> 41:15.480
And Luma can feel Dumaresq is being honest
on what he says and does.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.480
Dumaresq is a very articulate person.

41:18.560 --> 41:21.360
He's gonna get fifth place.

41:22.640 --> 41:24.920
I will rate Ray in fifth place.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.520
Because of what happened with Akel.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.760
She tried to "couple up" with him

41:30.840 --> 41:32.640
to have an ally.

41:32.720 --> 41:34.280
I was really upset about it.

41:34.360 --> 41:36.320
In third, I'm gonna place Luma.

41:36.400 --> 41:40.000
She has great potential
to be my friend in the game.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.840
She compliments me a lot, too.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.960
That's very important for my needy side.

41:44.040 --> 41:46.120
Fourth place goes to Ana.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.840
She's a bit sarcastic.

41:47.920 --> 41:50.320
She's full of jokes. She's great at that.

41:50.400 --> 41:52.400
But she's been...

41:53.120 --> 41:54.920
butting heads lately.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.520
-And...
-Some comments that are more serious.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.200
Circle, in sixth place,

41:59.640 --> 42:00.560
Luma.

42:01.920 --> 42:02.920
That's mean.

42:04.920 --> 42:06.960
But anyway, everybody here is playing.

42:07.040 --> 42:09.520
The first place, of course...

42:10.080 --> 42:11.040
goes to Marina.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.840
I could count on her, I could trust her.

42:13.920 --> 42:16.840
She told me to change my attitude
in the game.

42:16.920 --> 42:19.520
I'm gonna keep Lorayne in sixth.

42:19.600 --> 42:22.160
She hasn't been playing in a nice way.

42:22.240 --> 42:23.200
She plays dirty.

42:23.560 --> 42:26.240
And in last place, I'm gonna put JP.

42:26.600 --> 42:29.280
I got the impression
that the dude is a phony,

42:29.360 --> 42:31.480
from the talk I had with Lorayne.

42:31.840 --> 42:34.560
I didn't feel that way until he exposed me

42:34.640 --> 42:36.120
in front of everybody.

42:36.200 --> 42:39.120
Circle, send my ratings.

42:41.480 --> 42:44.480
"Ratings complete."

42:49.240 --> 42:51.520
<i>These ratings are very important.</i>

42:51.600 --> 42:55.200
<i>The race for a prize of 300,000 reais</i>
<i>is getting fierce.</i>

42:59.280 --> 43:01.960
Dude, I think I should talk to Marina.

43:02.040 --> 43:05.680
There are many things she doesn't know,
and I want her to know.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.960
Circle, open chat with Marina.

43:10.840 --> 43:13.640
"Lorayne has invited you
to a private chat."

43:17.200 --> 43:18.800
Oh, shit...

43:18.880 --> 43:20.720
Circle, message.

43:21.360 --> 43:24.280
Sis, I didn't talk about the breakfast
in the group chat

43:24.360 --> 43:25.800
because I don't trust Ray.

43:25.880 --> 43:27.480
When Akel came over...

43:27.560 --> 43:30.200
"...he told me she private messaged him

43:30.280 --> 43:33.160
saying she shipped RaKel."

43:36.960 --> 43:38.720
Heavy stuff!

43:41.320 --> 43:43.520
I have been saying that over and over.

43:44.280 --> 43:46.840
Ray is too available.

43:47.320 --> 43:48.680
Circle, message.

43:48.760 --> 43:51.080
Dude, I knew something was wrong.

43:51.160 --> 43:55.000
I realized you didn't entirely trust
all of them.

43:55.080 --> 43:56.200
Send.

43:56.280 --> 43:57.720
Circle, message.

43:57.800 --> 43:59.800
The fact that I lied,

43:59.880 --> 44:02.040
almost in desperation,

44:02.120 --> 44:03.920
to try and change things,

44:04.000 --> 44:06.720
that was wrong.
I shouldn't have done that.

44:06.800 --> 44:08.160
I regret it deeply.

44:08.240 --> 44:11.280
#MyFriend. #ITrustYou.

44:11.360 --> 44:12.200
Send.

44:12.560 --> 44:14.040
You can trust in ourselves.

44:14.480 --> 44:16.000
You can trust in ourselves.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.040
Everything will work out.

44:18.400 --> 44:22.760
Sis, take a deep breath
and stop clowning around.

44:22.840 --> 44:26.400
I want you in the final with me,
and I believe it'll happen.

44:26.480 --> 44:27.600
Send.

44:29.760 --> 44:32.680
I feel happy just reading her message.

44:32.760 --> 44:37.680
Wow, I really needed that.

44:39.120 --> 44:40.600
<i>In this very moment,</i>

44:40.680 --> 44:45.520
<i>the Circle's algorithms are calculating</i>
<i>the fate of our players.</i>

44:46.240 --> 44:48.200
ALERT!

44:48.280 --> 44:49.320
Alert!

44:49.400 --> 44:50.880
Oh, my God!

44:51.920 --> 44:53.760
-It's time.
-Lord help me.

44:55.520 --> 44:58.560
"The rating results are in."

44:58.640 --> 45:00.880
Oh, my God!

45:00.960 --> 45:02.240
I'm nervous again.

45:02.320 --> 45:05.040
-I try to stay calm.
-There's no way you cannot be nervous.

45:05.400 --> 45:06.280
There's no way.

45:06.360 --> 45:09.080
HOWEVER, THE RESULTS
ARE NOT GOING TO BE DISCLOSED

45:10.920 --> 45:12.920
"The results are not going
to be disclosed."

45:13.000 --> 45:15.160
Circle! What's your deal?

45:15.240 --> 45:16.960
My mind is blown right now.

45:18.760 --> 45:21.080
Will it be immediate once again?

45:22.680 --> 45:25.960
"The most popular player is now a..."

45:26.040 --> 45:28.280
-"...superinfluencer."
-Superinfluencer?

45:30.720 --> 45:32.760
It's not going to be two anymore.

45:32.960 --> 45:34.760
If an influencer has power,

45:35.320 --> 45:36.720
a superinfluencer...

45:37.120 --> 45:38.400
has a superpower.

45:38.800 --> 45:39.800
Right?

45:40.640 --> 45:42.600
"Wow, JP! You're a genius!"

45:42.680 --> 45:45.120
It might not be good
to be a superinfluencer.

45:45.200 --> 45:47.440
Because you can't discuss...

45:48.920 --> 45:51.840
with someone else who will be blocked.

45:51.920 --> 45:53.440
You can't share the blame.

45:55.080 --> 45:57.760
"This player is going to decide
by themselves

45:57.840 --> 45:59.800
who will be blocked from <i>The Circle."</i>

45:59.880 --> 46:01.720
I don't think anyone saw that coming.

46:01.800 --> 46:05.760
If the influencer doesn't like you,

46:06.680 --> 46:07.520
you're screwed.

46:07.800 --> 46:10.440
I think since I joined the game,

46:11.520 --> 46:14.200
this is the first time I ever got nervous.

46:24.480 --> 46:27.680
So, who do you think
is the superinfluencer? Tell me.

46:28.040 --> 46:29.040
Whisper it in my ear.

46:30.400 --> 46:31.280
I want...

46:32.040 --> 46:33.760
this Pizza Circle...

46:34.160 --> 46:36.600
to block Lorayne.

46:40.120 --> 46:41.920
Now it's up to you, Universe.

46:50.800 --> 46:51.800
Alert!

46:52.960 --> 46:54.680
Oh no...

46:54.760 --> 46:56.480
ALERT!

46:57.000 --> 46:58.520
YOU ARE THE SUPERINFLUENCER

47:11.160 --> 47:14.120
But if the results are not going
to be disclosed, how come...

47:14.440 --> 47:15.880
I'm waiting for them?

47:16.560 --> 47:17.480
Geez.

47:19.960 --> 47:22.120
Oh, my God!

47:23.080 --> 47:24.320
Luma!

47:24.400 --> 47:26.920
-My goodness.
-Call Luma! Call her over!

47:27.000 --> 47:28.160
Call Luma!

47:28.240 --> 47:32.040
Luma is a superinfluencer, dude.

47:34.600 --> 47:36.200
"You must decide

47:36.280 --> 47:39.400
which player will be blocked
from <i>The Circle."</i>

47:41.680 --> 47:43.160
Let's go over everyone.

47:43.240 --> 47:44.320
Ray, for instance.

47:44.880 --> 47:46.760
Why would we block her?

47:47.680 --> 47:49.200
Because Ray, in the future,

47:49.280 --> 47:52.560
is a profile that Luma would not miss.

47:52.920 --> 47:54.640
-She is Luma's competition.
-Yeah.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.800
Dumaresq in the game now...

48:00.240 --> 48:01.920
is proving to be a player...

48:03.040 --> 48:05.520
who is friendly, honest,

48:05.960 --> 48:07.120
and open.

48:08.720 --> 48:11.360
I think the focus is on other people.

48:11.640 --> 48:15.120
But you never know.
I thought about it once before,

48:15.200 --> 48:16.600
and I was shaking with fear.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.800
Ana still isn't a threat to Luma,

48:20.880 --> 48:22.720
but in the future...

48:26.560 --> 48:30.400
What about Lorayne?
Why would she be an option?

48:30.480 --> 48:33.840
-For lying in the chat.
-That would be the main reason.

48:33.920 --> 48:35.640
Lying about a breakfast?

48:36.000 --> 48:38.040
-Marina.
-Too self-absorbed.

48:38.120 --> 48:40.920
At the same time, great player.

48:41.400 --> 48:43.080
So, who will it be?

48:48.760 --> 48:49.880
I'm glad I'm safe.

48:54.200 --> 48:55.960
ALERT!

48:56.040 --> 48:57.040
Alert.

48:59.480 --> 49:01.080
The time has come.

49:02.920 --> 49:07.720
"The superinfluencer has made a decision."

49:07.800 --> 49:11.480
I still had hope I would be
the superinfluencer.

49:11.560 --> 49:13.480
Who could it be?

49:13.560 --> 49:14.520
Things are...

49:15.280 --> 49:16.680
very dark and unclear.

49:16.760 --> 49:19.120
I'm so lost.

49:20.840 --> 49:24.560
"But the decision will not be announced
in the Circle Chat."

49:24.640 --> 49:27.040
Oh, my God. Now what?

49:27.120 --> 49:29.280
-Let's go.
-I have a headache.

49:29.360 --> 49:30.240
Wig off.

49:35.720 --> 49:37.640
"You will not announce

49:37.720 --> 49:40.440
the blocking in the Circle Chat."

49:42.080 --> 49:44.360
-What?
-Whew. That's great.

49:44.440 --> 49:46.520
We'll not announce it in the Circle Chat.

49:46.600 --> 49:49.040
Wait. We don't know where it will be.

49:49.480 --> 49:53.120
YOU MUST GIVE THE NEWS IN PERSON

49:53.200 --> 49:55.800
"You must give the news in per..."

49:57.320 --> 49:58.680
No!

50:00.080 --> 50:00.960
Hey.

50:07.080 --> 50:09.840
"They'll give the news..."

50:10.280 --> 50:12.000
Wow!

50:12.080 --> 50:14.640
"They'll give the news in person."

50:15.640 --> 50:18.240
How stressful.

50:18.320 --> 50:20.960
Let's go. This is what it means
to be a superinfluencer.

50:28.560 --> 50:31.480
"The superinfluencer is on their way
to one of the apartments..."

50:31.560 --> 50:33.640
"...to announce their decision."

50:33.720 --> 50:35.600
Oh, my God! Lock the door!

50:44.880 --> 50:45.840
Oh, God.
