(laughing)

00:02.878 --> 00:05.046
My turn.

(making flatulent sound)

00:06.715 --> 00:08.759
(laughs)

00:10.135 --> 00:11.762
(making flatulent sound)

00:11.804 --> 00:13.054
(laughs)

00:13.096 --> 00:14.473
Wait, wait, wait.

00:15.975 --> 00:16.934
(making loud flatulent sound)

00:16.976 --> 00:18.978
(laughing)

00:19.019 --> 00:21.772
I had no idea homework

00:19.019 --> 00:21.772
could be so funny.

00:27.486 --> 00:29.989
It's suicide.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.491
I don't care,

00:30.030 --> 00:32.491
I'm going in.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.616
I just got back from the doctor.

01:14.658 --> 01:16.284
My spine is curved!

01:16.326 --> 01:17.953
How bad?

01:16.326 --> 01:17.953
No gym for two years.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.329
This is brilliant.

01:19.371 --> 01:22.791
I wonder if my third nipple

01:19.371 --> 01:22.791
can get me out of wrestling.

01:22.833 --> 01:23.751
DABNEY:

01:22.833 --> 01:23.751
It's worth a shot.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.044
Here comes...

01:25.084 --> 01:26.712
her royal...

01:26.754 --> 01:28.213
bitchiness.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.636
Cynthia just got back

01:32.217 --> 01:34.636
from a semester in New York

01:34.678 --> 01:36.137
and she's totally changed.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.598
She always used to be so happy.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.516
Now it's like

01:37.639 --> 01:39.516
she's given up on life.

01:39.558 --> 01:41.351
She's bitter and sarcastic.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.144
I mean, I could pull it off,

01:43.186 --> 01:44.396
but on her

01:43.186 --> 01:44.396
it's really unpleasant.

01:44.438 --> 01:49.150
Malcolm, can you ask

01:44.438 --> 01:49.150
your lemmings to move the herd

01:49.192 --> 01:51.319
an inch to the left

01:49.192 --> 01:51.319
so I could get past?

01:51.361 --> 01:54.155
I'm sorry,

01:51.361 --> 01:54.155
did you say "inch"?

01:54.197 --> 01:56.324
Don't you mean

01:54.197 --> 01:56.324
2.54 centimeters?

01:56.366 --> 01:58.326
Or .254 decimeters?

01:58.368 --> 02:01.329
Or 25.4 million nanometers?

02:01.371 --> 02:03.082
Come on, guys,

02:01.371 --> 02:03.082
stop teasing her.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.165
You stink at it.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.334
Don't defend her, Malcolm.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.795
If I wanted

02:06.376 --> 02:07.795
this kind of abuse,

02:07.836 --> 02:10.756
I'd have a conversation

02:07.836 --> 02:10.756
with my oboe teacher.

02:10.798 --> 02:15.803
She's... dead... to us.

02:18.221 --> 02:21.767
Hey, are you okay?

02:21.809 --> 02:24.352
What are you talking about?

02:21.809 --> 02:24.352
What do you mean?

02:24.394 --> 02:26.688
Well, you've been acting

02:24.394 --> 02:26.688
kind of strange lately.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.190
Malcolm, look around you

02:29.232 --> 02:32.360
and reconsider your

02:29.232 --> 02:32.360
definition of strange.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.405
Over 12% deviation

02:32.402 --> 02:35.405
from vertical.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.532
Fair enough.

02:40.035 --> 02:42.203
Dad, look how high my kite is.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.205
Oh, that's great, son.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.457
That's terrific.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.126
You want to try?

02:47.167 --> 02:49.210
Uh, no.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.210
Why not?

02:49.252 --> 02:50.587
I don't like kites.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.840
What do you mean

02:50.629 --> 02:52.840
you don't like kites?

02:52.881 --> 02:55.092
I don't like kites

02:52.881 --> 02:55.092
and they don't like me.

02:55.134 --> 02:56.135
We-we just don't get along.

02:56.175 --> 02:58.219
You'd like it

02:56.175 --> 02:58.219
if you tried it.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.638
Come on. Just try it.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.222
Hold the string.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.475
(Hal groaning)

03:15.988 --> 03:17.114
(yelps)

03:17.156 --> 03:18.157
Hey, Lois.

03:18.197 --> 03:20.951
Karen, what are you

03:18.197 --> 03:20.951
doing out there?

03:20.993 --> 03:22.828
Come on in.

03:22.870 --> 03:23.829
I'm sorry.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.539
I didn't mean to lurk.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.875
I was working up the nerve

03:25.580 --> 03:27.875
to talk to you.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.417
Are you okay?

03:29.459 --> 03:32.087
You look different.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.254
I'm sober.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.464
Oh.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.717
Yeah, after I drove across

03:34.506 --> 03:36.717
that miniature golf course,

03:36.758 --> 03:39.260
they made me get into

03:36.758 --> 03:39.260
a 12-step program, so...

03:39.302 --> 03:40.261
Good for you.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.139
Yeah, thanks.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.139
I'm doing really great.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.264
Anyway, I'm up to the part

03:43.306 --> 03:45.266
where I'm supposed

03:43.306 --> 03:45.266
to make amends

03:45.308 --> 03:46.852
to the people that I've hurt.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.645
What did you

03:46.894 --> 03:48.645
ever do to me?

03:48.687 --> 03:50.480
Remember New Year's

03:48.687 --> 03:50.480
at Deb and Rich's

03:50.522 --> 03:53.108
where everyone was kissing

03:50.522 --> 03:53.108
at midnight?

03:53.150 --> 03:54.109
Yeah.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.569
Well, when I kissed

03:54.151 --> 03:55.569
your husband,

03:55.610 --> 03:58.572
I kind of...

03:55.610 --> 03:58.572
stuck my tongue in his mouth.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.281
I mean,

03:58.613 --> 04:00.281
I felt really terrible.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.282
And then after that

04:01.324 --> 04:03.118
I put my cigarette out

04:01.324 --> 04:03.118
in Rich's toupee.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.286
And those things go up

04:03.160 --> 04:05.286
so quickly, I had...

04:05.328 --> 04:07.915
You were French-kissing

04:05.328 --> 04:07.915
my husband?

04:07.956 --> 04:09.083
Don't be mad at him, Lois.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.334
He pushed me away

04:09.124 --> 04:11.334
after like five or six seconds.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.461
Well, it was definitely

04:11.376 --> 04:13.461
no more than ten.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.588
And I'm sure

04:13.503 --> 04:14.588
the only reason

04:14.629 --> 04:15.881
he was moving his tongue around

04:15.923 --> 04:17.883
was because he was trying

04:15.923 --> 04:17.883
to say something.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.093
That's enough, Karen.

04:19.134 --> 04:20.219
I-I-I get it.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.887
I'm sorry.

04:21.929 --> 04:22.763
(Karen sighing)

04:22.804 --> 04:24.305
Now I have to go

04:22.804 --> 04:24.305
over to Stephanie's

04:24.347 --> 04:26.934
and tell her she can take

04:24.347 --> 04:26.934
down those lost dog posters.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.146
Come on, Francis.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.355
It's Friday night.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.315
Can we please go out

04:32.397 --> 04:34.315
and get hammered?

04:34.357 --> 04:36.317
Is getting drunk all

04:34.357 --> 04:36.317
you ever think about?

04:36.359 --> 04:37.318
I mean, look at us.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.695
We work like dogs all day.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.989
We drink and then we work

04:38.737 --> 04:40.989
like hungover dogs.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.324
Is this really how

04:41.031 --> 04:43.324
you pictured your life?

04:43.366 --> 04:44.910
Ever since I was little.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.327
Why, what'd you picture?

04:46.369 --> 04:47.328
I don't know.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.164
There's just got

04:47.370 --> 04:49.164
to be more to life

04:49.206 --> 04:50.498
than getting

04:49.206 --> 04:50.498
falling-down drunk

04:50.540 --> 04:51.959
and behaving

04:50.540 --> 04:51.959
like a jackass.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.418
(laughing)

04:53.460 --> 04:55.545
Just looky what we found.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.135
You stole a totem pole?

04:59.216 --> 05:01.135
No, no, no,

05:01.176 --> 05:02.343
he asked to

05:01.176 --> 05:02.343
come with us.

05:02.385 --> 05:05.180
He hasn't shut up

05:02.385 --> 05:05.180
for an hour.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.431
You can't leave

05:05.222 --> 05:06.431
this here.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.391
People worship these things.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.935
It's like a sacred object.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.979
Do I have something in my teeth?

05:12.020 --> 05:13.396
Be honest.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.396
(laughing)

05:13.438 --> 05:14.940
What is wrong with you people?!

05:14.982 --> 05:17.358
You see a symbol

05:14.982 --> 05:17.358
of a world

05:17.400 --> 05:19.444
beyond scraping grease,

05:17.400 --> 05:19.444
and your first thought is,

05:19.486 --> 05:21.404
let's profane it

05:19.486 --> 05:21.404
in our cabin?

05:21.446 --> 05:24.616
Don't you have any respect

05:21.446 --> 05:24.616
for anything?!

05:25.408 --> 05:26.785
Look, a penny.

05:26.827 --> 05:27.953
It's mine!

05:27.995 --> 05:29.163
I saw it first!

05:29.204 --> 05:30.622
(arguing continues)

05:30.664 --> 05:32.373
CYNTHIA:

05:30.664 --> 05:32.373
Is my coffee ready yet?

05:32.415 --> 05:34.793
I can't believe you

05:32.415 --> 05:34.793
only have instant.

05:34.835 --> 05:38.088
I'm sorry our "Fol-gérs"

05:34.835 --> 05:38.088
isn't up to your standards.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.380
And I'd be a little

05:38.130 --> 05:39.380
more impressed

05:39.422 --> 05:41.300
with your coffee-drinking

05:39.422 --> 05:41.300
sophistication

05:41.340 --> 05:43.218
if you weren't wearing

05:41.340 --> 05:43.218
a kitty sweater.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.970
I'm supposed to take style tips

05:45.012 --> 05:47.889
from someone who keeps track

05:45.012 --> 05:47.889
of wrestling feuds.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.599
You know,

05:47.931 --> 05:49.599
ever since you've been back,

05:49.641 --> 05:50.684
you've been mean to everyone.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.393
I know you think

05:50.725 --> 05:52.393
you're better than us.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.854
Even if that's true,

05:53.895 --> 05:55.314
it doesn't give you

05:53.895 --> 05:55.314
the right

05:55.396 --> 05:56.315
to be nasty.

05:56.355 --> 05:57.398
If you keep this up,

05:57.440 --> 05:58.692
you're not going

05:57.440 --> 05:58.692
to have any friends.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.402
You think you know

05:58.733 --> 06:01.402
what everybody's problem is?

06:01.444 --> 06:02.403
Well, guess what,

06:01.444 --> 06:02.403
you don't.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.698
You think you're so smart

06:02.445 --> 06:04.698
and together

06:04.739 --> 06:07.909
and that no one notices

06:04.739 --> 06:07.909
what an unhappy little person

06:07.951 --> 06:09.244
you are.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.411
I'm sorry.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.412
I'm not going to stroke

06:11.454 --> 06:14.208
your fragile ego

06:11.454 --> 06:14.208
by confiding in you.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.250
Oh, yeah?

06:15.292 --> 06:17.252
Well, you're on fire.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.837
(screaming)

06:27.054 --> 06:28.930
(gasps)

06:28.972 --> 06:30.974
Mommy.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.647
CYNTHIA:

06:36.063 --> 06:37.647
How could you

06:36.063 --> 06:37.647
do that to me?

06:37.689 --> 06:39.691
You were on fire.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.691
I was just trying to help.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.526
How does yelling,

06:39.733 --> 06:41.526
"Oh, my God,

06:41.568 --> 06:43.653
where did those

06:41.568 --> 06:43.653
come from?" help?

06:43.695 --> 06:44.654
I'm sorry.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.073
It just...

06:46.114 --> 06:47.241
you scared me.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.075
They scared me.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.450
I mean, they don't scare me.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.660
They startled me. I...

06:50.702 --> 06:51.536
I hate this.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.454
Everyone looks at me

06:51.578 --> 06:53.454
like you did.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.290
Like I'm some kind of freak.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.125
I was surprised, that's all.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.459
It's just really different.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.503
I mean, I would react

06:58.501 --> 07:00.503
the same way

07:00.545 --> 07:02.130
if you had a new haircut.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.464
A giant haircut.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.884
No one can know

07:03.506 --> 07:05.884
about this.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.719
You can't tell anyone!

07:07.761 --> 07:08.970
What are you talking about?

07:09.012 --> 07:10.180
Promise me.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.180
But...

07:10.222 --> 07:11.348
Promise.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.349
All right. All right.

07:12.391 --> 07:13.474
I promise.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.394
Come on. You're fine.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.521
This is just a change

07:15.435 --> 07:18.521
on the outside.

07:18.563 --> 07:21.400
I mean, inside

07:18.563 --> 07:21.400
you're the same.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.111
If you give people a chance,

07:22.525 --> 07:24.111
they'll see that.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.280
Will you stop staring at them?

07:26.321 --> 07:28.531
Am... am I staring?

07:28.573 --> 07:29.908
Dad, I've been thinking

07:29.950 --> 07:32.493
about how to fix

07:29.950 --> 07:32.493
your kite problem.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.080
I don't have a kite problem.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.206
It's okay, Dad.

07:36.248 --> 07:37.498
Maybe we could start

07:37.540 --> 07:40.127
with you explaining

07:37.540 --> 07:40.127
why you hate kites.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.505
Let me try it. I want to try.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.507
Fine. Here, jerk.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.846
(gasps)

07:55.392 --> 07:56.935
Help me! Help!

08:01.564 --> 08:04.985
I just do! There doesn't need

08:01.564 --> 08:04.985
to be a reason.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.528
(clicking tongue)

08:07.570 --> 08:09.530
Doesn't Dewey

08:07.570 --> 08:09.530
ever have any homework?

08:09.572 --> 08:10.615
He seems to have

08:10.657 --> 08:12.533
an awful lot of time

08:10.657 --> 08:12.533
on his hands.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.535
Something wrong?

08:12.575 --> 08:14.535
Yesterday I had

08:14.577 --> 08:17.164
the most interesting

08:14.577 --> 08:17.164
conversation with Karen.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.539
She's in this program

08:18.581 --> 08:20.541
where you have to apologize

08:18.581 --> 08:20.541
to your loved ones,

08:20.583 --> 08:22.543
and it got me thinking...

08:22.585 --> 08:26.214
do I have anything that

08:22.585 --> 08:26.214
I need to apologize for?

08:26.256 --> 08:27.424
Okay, by you, you mean me.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.384
And since you're phrasing it

08:27.466 --> 08:29.384
as a question,

08:29.426 --> 08:31.052
it means you already

08:29.426 --> 08:31.052
know the answer.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.472
Karen told me that

08:31.094 --> 08:33.472
you French-kissed her

08:33.513 --> 08:34.555
on New Year's Eve.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.391
What? I did not.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.559
I can't believe it.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.396
You-You're actually accusing me

08:38.601 --> 08:41.396
of this?

08:41.438 --> 08:42.939
Why would Karen lie?

08:42.981 --> 08:43.815
Why would  I  lie?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.484
Lois, for the past 20 years

08:45.525 --> 08:46.567
yours has been

08:45.525 --> 08:46.567
the only tongue

08:46.609 --> 08:47.819
that's been in my mouth.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.447
Now, you're just going

08:47.861 --> 08:50.447
to have to believe that.

08:50.489 --> 08:51.572
I don't lie.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.658
So, are we going

08:51.614 --> 08:53.658
to fly kites tomorrow?

08:53.700 --> 08:56.577
Sorry, son, I have

08:53.700 --> 08:56.577
to testify at a

08:53.700 --> 08:56.577
murder trial.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.787
But darn it, you're my son

08:57.829 --> 08:59.789
and I want to go to

08:57.829 --> 08:59.789
the park with you.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.291
Thanks, Dad.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.417
The kids don't count.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.877
Hal, it wouldn't be

09:02.459 --> 09:03.877
such a big deal

09:03.918 --> 09:05.212
if you would just admit it.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.754
Oh, come on, Lois.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.466
What possible reason would

09:06.796 --> 09:09.466
I have to kiss Karen?

09:09.508 --> 09:10.591
You're a man.

09:10.633 --> 09:11.676
What is that

09:10.633 --> 09:11.676
supposed to mean?

09:11.718 --> 09:13.845
You have been with the same

09:11.718 --> 09:13.845
woman all these years.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.098
It's only natural

09:13.887 --> 09:17.098
to be a little... curious.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.433
About what?

09:18.475 --> 09:19.434
You mean to tell me,

09:19.476 --> 09:20.852
after all these years

09:19.476 --> 09:20.852
of marriage,

09:20.894 --> 09:23.646
you've never even so much

09:20.894 --> 09:23.646
as thought about another woman?

09:23.688 --> 09:26.024
What are you talking about?

09:26.066 --> 09:27.608
If you are just going

09:26.066 --> 09:27.608
to be ridiculous,

09:27.650 --> 09:31.112
there is no point in carrying on

09:27.650 --> 09:31.112
this conversation.

09:31.154 --> 09:34.491
But you are on notice.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.832
Wait! I want to talk to you!

09:47.670 --> 09:49.464
You are unhappy.

09:49.506 --> 09:50.882
Yes, I am.

09:50.924 --> 09:51.674
Why?

09:51.716 --> 09:53.676
I think

09:51.716 --> 09:53.676
I may have ruined my life.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.054
I left my family and friends

09:53.718 --> 09:56.054
to come up here.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.139
I was supposed

09:56.096 --> 09:58.139
to be finding myself,

09:58.181 --> 10:00.808
but all I feel is empty.

10:00.850 --> 10:04.062
I have the answer

10:00.850 --> 10:04.062
to your suffering, Francis.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.480
The answer is...

10:05.522 --> 10:06.814
PETE:

10:05.522 --> 10:06.814
Francis!

10:06.856 --> 10:07.732
Oh.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.443
Who was that spiky-head kid

10:09.484 --> 10:11.236
that was friends

10:09.484 --> 10:11.236
with Little Lulu?

10:11.278 --> 10:12.237
What?

10:12.279 --> 10:13.488
Ah, don't worry.

10:13.530 --> 10:16.783
Maybe it'll come to you

10:13.530 --> 10:16.783
if you sleep on it, hmm?

10:22.497 --> 10:23.664
Everything's ready.

10:23.706 --> 10:24.832
The kite tail is set.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.042
It's a windy day.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.668
Now, say it.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.670
I am not cursed.

10:29.712 --> 10:30.713
Good. Now, run

10:30.755 --> 10:33.758
and don't stop

10:30.755 --> 10:33.758
until it's in the air.

10:36.636 --> 10:40.056
I am not cursed.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.683
(whimpering)

10:42.725 --> 10:43.893
(angry chatter)

10:43.935 --> 10:45.312
Come on, get out

10:43.935 --> 10:45.312
of the field.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.523
Oh, excuse me.

10:49.732 --> 10:50.733
Sorry.

10:52.444 --> 10:53.570
(laughing)

10:53.612 --> 10:56.531
It's flying!

10:56.573 --> 10:59.033
(grunts)

11:00.160 --> 11:01.286
(nasal laughter)

11:01.328 --> 11:02.870
I can't believe

11:02.912 --> 11:05.499
you guys threw refrigerator

11:02.912 --> 11:05.499
magnets at Dabney's back brace.

11:05.540 --> 11:06.625
Come on. It was great.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.708
He was walking

11:06.666 --> 11:07.708
around all day

11:07.750 --> 11:09.710
with "Florida is for

11:07.750 --> 11:09.710
Lovers" on his back.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.172
(laughing shrilly)

11:12.213 --> 11:13.965
That laugh is so not cute.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.717
I'm sorry my laugh

11:14.007 --> 11:16.717
isn't as melodious

11:16.759 --> 11:18.719
as your lovely, cracking voice.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.721
"My name's Malcolm.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.724
I have all the answers,

11:20.763 --> 11:23.724
but no one to listen to me."

11:23.766 --> 11:24.725
Oh, that's funny.

11:24.767 --> 11:25.726
(laughs and snorts)

11:25.768 --> 11:28.729
(laughing)

11:28.771 --> 11:30.565
This was fun.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.734
Hi, Reese.

11:35.278 --> 11:36.363
What a pig.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.323
What?

11:36.404 --> 11:38.323
What happened

11:36.404 --> 11:38.323
to your friend?

11:38.365 --> 11:40.741
She was never that

11:38.365 --> 11:40.741
great, but now, geez.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.743
It's like she's

11:40.783 --> 11:42.743
trying to be ugly.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.037
Shut up.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.037
Someone

11:42.785 --> 11:44.037
should tell her

11:44.078 --> 11:46.373
she's not in

11:44.078 --> 11:46.373
Euro-pee-uh anymore.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.748
In America

11:46.414 --> 11:47.748
we take showers.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.750
Drop it, Reese.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.750
She doesn't smell.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.752
Well, she dresses

11:49.792 --> 11:51.752
like a bag lady.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.004
Oh, oh, I know.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.840
Her butt is gigantic, and

11:53.046 --> 11:55.840
she's trying to hide it.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.050
This is so great.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.801
I have so much

11:57.091 --> 11:58.801
material for that.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.387
I have a "wide load"

11:58.843 --> 12:00.387
sticker

12:00.428 --> 12:02.763
and I can make

12:00.428 --> 12:02.763
the truck noise

12:00.428 --> 12:02.763
when she backs up.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.683
Beep, beep, beep...

12:04.723 --> 12:07.561
Reese, when exactly

12:04.723 --> 12:07.561
is she going to back up?

12:07.602 --> 12:08.687
You're right.

12:08.727 --> 12:09.770
Okay, when's her

12:08.727 --> 12:09.770
lunch period?

12:09.812 --> 12:11.772
I think I'll sneak in

12:09.812 --> 12:11.772
and throw bacon at her.

12:11.814 --> 12:12.815
Then she'll back up.

12:12.857 --> 12:13.816
Beep, beep, beep...

12:13.858 --> 12:15.985
Look, moron,

12:13.858 --> 12:15.985
she's not hiding her butt.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.154
She's hiding her big boobs,

12:16.027 --> 12:18.154
okay?

12:18.196 --> 12:22.367
So, if you tease her,

12:18.196 --> 12:22.367
you're just going

12:18.196 --> 12:22.367
to look like a...

12:22.409 --> 12:25.412
You are a good,

12:22.409 --> 12:25.412
good brother.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.954
No.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.249
I lied.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.249
Her butt  is  huge.

12:35.714 --> 12:36.797
I think it helped Cynthia

12:36.839 --> 12:37.965
to tell me

12:36.839 --> 12:37.965
what was bothering her.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.800
She's been in a much better mood

12:38.007 --> 12:39.800
at school.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.802
She even stuck her homework

12:39.842 --> 12:41.802
up on Dabney's back.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.638
(screams)

12:43.680 --> 12:45.640
What are you doing?!

12:43.680 --> 12:45.640
Algebra.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.395
What did he say to you?

12:50.437 --> 12:51.521
Malcolm, calm down.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.814
I'm just helping him

12:51.563 --> 12:53.814
with his homework.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.983
You know Reese doesn't

12:53.856 --> 12:55.983
care about school.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.193
That's what  I  thought,

12:57.235 --> 12:59.820
but when he asked

12:57.235 --> 12:59.820
me for help,

12:59.862 --> 13:03.866
he sounded so pathetic,

12:59.862 --> 13:03.866
I couldn't say no.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.620
How are you doing

13:03.908 --> 13:06.620
on number five?

13:06.661 --> 13:09.414
Awful. I'm never going

13:06.661 --> 13:09.414
to get this.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.831
I'm such an idiot.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.459
No, you're not.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.545
Everyone says I'm an idiot

13:12.500 --> 13:15.545
all the time.

13:15.587 --> 13:16.879
Well, he is.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.548
Malcolm!

13:18.590 --> 13:20.007
It's not his fault.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.218
Someone at some point

13:20.049 --> 13:22.218
decided I was dumb,

13:22.260 --> 13:24.137
and that's all

13:22.260 --> 13:24.137
anyone ever sees of me.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.306
Why do they always focus

13:24.178 --> 13:26.306
on one detail?

13:26.347 --> 13:29.850
They can never look

13:26.347 --> 13:29.850
at the whole person.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.395
I don't know.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.025
Francis, man,

13:36.274 --> 13:38.025
Lavernia's going to kill you

13:38.067 --> 13:39.860
if you miss another shift.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.280
Let her. I'm not

13:39.902 --> 13:42.280
walking away from this

13:39.902 --> 13:42.280
totem pole right now.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.864
Not when I'm this

13:42.322 --> 13:43.864
close to figuring out

13:43.906 --> 13:45.116
what it is it's

13:43.906 --> 13:45.116
trying to tell me.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.076
Have you even eaten anything?

13:47.118 --> 13:48.035
No. I'm fasting.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.370
It helps my meditation.

13:49.412 --> 13:50.871
I can't explain it,

13:49.412 --> 13:50.871
but there's some kind

13:50.913 --> 13:52.332
of an energy running

13:50.913 --> 13:52.332
through this thing.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.500
It gave me that dream.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.876
It's trying to help me

13:53.541 --> 13:55.876
get to something.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.504
That's it. We're getting rid

13:55.918 --> 13:57.504
of this thing,

13:57.545 --> 13:59.673
and we're putting you back

13:57.545 --> 13:59.673
on corn dogs and porn

13:59.714 --> 14:01.257
for your own safety.

14:01.299 --> 14:02.509
(grunts)

14:03.510 --> 14:05.720
Back away from the pole.

14:05.762 --> 14:10.391
So... you guys want to go...

14:10.433 --> 14:12.393
shoot some eagles?

14:12.435 --> 14:15.188
Nothing else to do.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.822
What are you going

14:23.863 --> 14:24.698
to do to her?

14:24.739 --> 14:26.783
I don't know what you're

14:24.739 --> 14:26.783
talking about.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.909
Okay, I've been dying

14:26.825 --> 14:28.909
to tell someone.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.829
Malcolm,

14:28.951 --> 14:30.829
I'm going to see them.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.121
What?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.121
I'm going to be nice

14:30.870 --> 14:32.121
to her,

14:32.163 --> 14:35.333
make her my girlfriend,

14:32.163 --> 14:35.333
and get her to take her top off.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.292
You're crazy.

14:36.334 --> 14:37.918
That's what  I  thought

14:36.334 --> 14:37.918
at first,

14:37.960 --> 14:39.754
but I've got it

14:37.960 --> 14:39.754
all figured out.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.174
I've been working on this

14:41.548 --> 14:43.174
for days.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.719
Tomorrow I'll reveal

14:43.216 --> 14:45.719
an embarrassing secret

14:45.760 --> 14:47.094
that makes her feel trusted.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.930
Friday I'll sneak a kiss

14:47.136 --> 14:49.930
and then apologize.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.932
Three days later

14:49.972 --> 14:51.932
I actually ask her out,

14:51.974 --> 14:54.185
she catches me crying,

14:51.974 --> 14:54.185
make-out session,

14:54.227 --> 14:56.229
she discovers a love letter

14:54.227 --> 14:56.229
in my back pocket,

14:56.270 --> 14:59.940
heavier make-out session,

14:56.270 --> 14:59.940
all culminating in March 8:

14:59.982 --> 15:01.693
Double-D Day.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.363
You're pure evil!

15:05.405 --> 15:06.614
Who's more evil?

15:06.656 --> 15:08.449
Me or the person who told me?

15:08.491 --> 15:10.951
You!

15:08.491 --> 15:10.951
Yeah, but  you'd  still be

15:08.491 --> 15:10.951
in trouble.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.953
I bet she'd never

15:10.993 --> 15:12.953
forgive you.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.330
Now, if you'll excuse me,

15:14.372 --> 15:16.457
I have to go make

15:14.372 --> 15:16.457
a mix tape.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.461
Okay, so we had

15:18.418 --> 15:20.461
a little setback,

15:20.503 --> 15:21.962
but don't give up.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.883
(howling):

15:22.004 --> 15:24.883
Oh, forget it!

15:24.924 --> 15:26.384
I'm sick of this!

15:26.426 --> 15:27.176
I hate kites!

15:27.218 --> 15:29.637
I have always hated kites!

15:29.679 --> 15:32.973
Dad, don't freak out

15:29.679 --> 15:32.973
in front of the other kids.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.975
No! I'm never

15:33.015 --> 15:34.975
going to get this

15:35.017 --> 15:36.603
and I don't want to!

15:36.644 --> 15:38.145
You can't just give up.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.481
I can give up

15:38.187 --> 15:40.481
whenever I want

15:38.187 --> 15:40.481
to, and I give up!

15:40.523 --> 15:41.816
That's it!

15:41.858 --> 15:42.983
I'm tired of your attitude.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.151
I'm going home.

15:44.193 --> 15:47.488
Dewey! Dewey,

15:44.193 --> 15:47.488
come back here.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.990
It's too far

15:47.530 --> 15:49.990
for you to walk.

15:50.032 --> 15:50.991
Oh!

15:51.033 --> 15:53.661
Dewey!

15:53.703 --> 15:56.664
Dewey, stop!

15:56.706 --> 15:58.583
Dewey!

15:58.625 --> 16:01.252
Don't you ever run

15:58.625 --> 16:01.252
away like that again!

16:01.294 --> 16:04.714
There's something

16:01.294 --> 16:04.714
on the back of your pants.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.010
(laughs)

16:10.052 --> 16:12.847
I'm flying a kite!

16:12.889 --> 16:15.683
I'm flying a kite!

16:15.725 --> 16:17.017
Lois, I did it!

16:17.059 --> 16:18.102
I did it!

16:18.144 --> 16:19.854
I actually flew a kite!

16:19.896 --> 16:22.816
I can't believe

16:19.896 --> 16:22.816
I actually thought

16:19.896 --> 16:22.816
these were evil.

16:22.857 --> 16:23.858
I love this kite.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.693
Why don't you kiss it?

16:25.735 --> 16:27.445
Oh, for God's sake.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.864
Are you still

16:27.487 --> 16:29.864
obsessing about that?

16:29.906 --> 16:31.825
I want a straight answer

16:29.906 --> 16:31.825
out of you.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.033
Lois, I swear,

16:33.075 --> 16:34.452
from the moment

16:33.075 --> 16:34.452
I laid eyes on you,

16:34.494 --> 16:36.913
you were the only woman

16:34.494 --> 16:36.913
in the world for me.

16:36.955 --> 16:37.914
So you mean to tell me

16:37.956 --> 16:39.206
that unlike

16:37.956 --> 16:39.206
any other man alive,

16:39.248 --> 16:40.959
you don't even have

16:39.248 --> 16:40.959
a glancing interest

16:41.000 --> 16:42.042
for other women?

16:42.084 --> 16:44.879
You and you alone stand

16:42.084 --> 16:44.879
outside the dictates

16:44.921 --> 16:46.631
of millions of years

16:44.921 --> 16:46.631
of evolution?

16:46.673 --> 16:49.550
Why is that so hard

16:46.673 --> 16:49.550
for you to believe?

16:49.592 --> 16:52.553
Because I look at other men!

16:53.888 --> 16:55.431
Not seriously

16:55.473 --> 16:57.099
and I would never

16:55.473 --> 16:57.099
do anything about it,

16:57.141 --> 17:00.102
but, God, Hal, I notice.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.939
And if you don't,

17:00.144 --> 17:02.939
it means that...

17:04.190 --> 17:06.275
...it means that

17:04.190 --> 17:06.275
you love me

17:06.317 --> 17:08.068
more than I love you.

17:08.110 --> 17:11.071
Well, honey, that's

17:08.110 --> 17:11.071
always been true.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.073
Of course I love you more.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.451
And you're okay with that?

17:15.493 --> 17:16.744
Oh, yeah.

17:16.786 --> 17:17.912
I mean, think about it.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.497
If you loved me

17:17.954 --> 17:19.497
as much as I loved you,

17:19.539 --> 17:21.081
we'd never leave the bedroom.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.375
Nothing would get done.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.084
We'd die of starvation.

17:24.126 --> 17:27.087
(chuckling):

17:24.126 --> 17:27.087
I love you!

17:27.129 --> 17:29.340
Oh...

17:30.174 --> 17:32.802
Not as much

17:30.174 --> 17:32.802
as I love you.

17:32.844 --> 17:35.262
I have fasted, I have meditated,

17:35.304 --> 17:38.182
I got frostbite spending a night

17:35.304 --> 17:38.182
in the wilderness.

17:38.224 --> 17:41.101
I just want to know what to do.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.102
What am I missing?

17:42.144 --> 17:44.522
Okay, let's see, there's a wolf.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.982
What's that?

17:46.024 --> 17:47.400
Loyalty.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.693
And the eagle.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.738
Keen insight. Insight.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.113
And the frog is...

17:53.155 --> 17:55.408
bug-eating.

17:55.449 --> 17:58.118
But what does it have to do

17:55.449 --> 17:58.118
with anything?!

17:58.160 --> 18:02.999
Please, just give me a sign

17:58.160 --> 18:02.999
or-or a signal or-or something!

18:05.835 --> 18:07.003
Oh, my God!

18:07.045 --> 18:10.631
You the dirtbag

18:07.045 --> 18:10.631
that took my pole?

18:07.045 --> 18:10.631
Huh?

18:10.673 --> 18:12.132
That's my pole.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.634
I want it back.

18:13.676 --> 18:14.969
Oh, of course.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.512
I'm so sorry.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.765
Look, I didn't take it,

18:16.554 --> 18:18.765
but, please, I'm going crazy.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.516
Can you tell me what it means?

18:20.558 --> 18:22.060
Well, if I hit it,

18:22.101 --> 18:24.353
it means I'm five inches away

18:22.101 --> 18:24.353
from the back of my carport.

18:24.395 --> 18:27.857
What?! You use this

18:24.395 --> 18:27.857
as a wheel stop?

18:27.899 --> 18:30.192
This beautiful, sacred thing?

18:30.234 --> 18:31.945
Sacred? It's a decoration.

18:31.986 --> 18:34.405
You know, like a coat

18:31.986 --> 18:34.405
of arms or a storybook.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.033
It's a pretty chunk of wood

18:34.447 --> 18:37.033
that my kids helped me carve

18:37.075 --> 18:38.743
on a nice Saturday afternoon.

18:38.785 --> 18:42.162
But you can't tell me that

18:38.785 --> 18:42.162
you can't feel the energy...!

18:42.204 --> 18:44.164
You white boys are all the same.

18:44.206 --> 18:47.251
I've got dark skin,

18:44.206 --> 18:47.251
so I must dance with the bears

18:47.293 --> 18:49.837
and listen to the spirit

18:47.293 --> 18:49.837
of the wind.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.171
I've got news for you.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.423
I work for a living.

18:52.465 --> 18:56.218
I'm a Baptist,

18:52.465 --> 18:56.218
and I'm proud of it.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.845
But...

18:57.887 --> 18:59.097
are you sure?

18:59.138 --> 19:03.559
And by the way,

18:59.138 --> 19:03.559
I have only one word for snow:

19:03.601 --> 19:06.104
snow.

19:09.231 --> 19:12.359
(girl giggling)

19:12.401 --> 19:13.193
No!

19:13.235 --> 19:13.820
Stop!

19:13.861 --> 19:15.613
Malcolm...

19:15.655 --> 19:17.907
Don't do this.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.907
He's not who you think he is.

19:17.949 --> 19:19.199
I didn't want

19:17.949 --> 19:19.199
to tell you,

19:19.241 --> 19:20.200
but the only reason

19:20.242 --> 19:21.285
Reese has shown

19:20.242 --> 19:21.285
any interest in you

19:21.327 --> 19:23.037
is because I told him

19:21.327 --> 19:23.037
you have big breasts.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.204
What?

19:23.079 --> 19:24.204
It just happened.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.790
I'm really sorry.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.208
But he only wants you

19:25.832 --> 19:28.208
for your boobs.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.251
Stop saying that!

19:29.293 --> 19:31.211
He planned all this.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.006
I can prove it.

19:33.047 --> 19:34.715
He wrote it all down.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.216
This isn't it.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.885
Where's your real calendar?

19:37.927 --> 19:39.637
That  is  my calendar.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.098
All the proceeds went

19:39.679 --> 19:42.098
to an animal shelter.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.474
He's just using you.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.225
And what's worse is

19:43.516 --> 19:45.225
you're falling for it.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.227
Leave me alone!

19:47.269 --> 19:48.646
You heard her!

19:48.688 --> 19:50.857
But...

19:50.898 --> 19:52.525
What's her name?

19:52.566 --> 19:54.110
What?

19:54.152 --> 19:57.113
What's... her... name?

20:00.366 --> 20:02.869
I know what her name is.

20:02.910 --> 20:06.246
And I am not going

20:02.910 --> 20:06.246
to dignify that with a response.

20:06.288 --> 20:10.668
I know what her name is,

20:06.288 --> 20:10.668
and her name... is...

20:13.587 --> 20:14.755
Uh...

20:15.214 --> 20:16.256
(groans)

20:16.298 --> 20:18.885
How can you be so creepy?!

20:18.926 --> 20:19.886
Don't you even have

20:19.927 --> 20:21.470
the remotest sense

20:19.927 --> 20:21.470
of decency

20:21.512 --> 20:23.556
towards a fellow

20:21.512 --> 20:23.556
human being?

20:23.597 --> 20:25.141
I have feelings!

20:25.183 --> 20:28.268
I will be treated

20:25.183 --> 20:28.268
with respect!

20:25.183 --> 20:28.268
(Reese yelling)

20:28.310 --> 20:30.188
I will not be

20:28.310 --> 20:30.188
objectified!

20:30.229 --> 20:33.273
I will not be humiliated

20:30.229 --> 20:33.273
or demeaned!

20:33.315 --> 20:34.775
Now kiss my shoe!

20:34.817 --> 20:35.776
(Reese screams)

20:35.818 --> 20:37.904
Kiss... my... shoe!

20:37.945 --> 20:39.279
HAL:

20:37.945 --> 20:39.279
The private says,

20:39.321 --> 20:41.281
"But, General, I didn't

20:39.321 --> 20:41.281
touch your toast!"

20:41.323 --> 20:42.366
(both laughing)

20:42.408 --> 20:43.283
(snorts)

20:43.325 --> 20:44.368
So, Cynthia,

20:44.410 --> 20:46.162
something's

20:44.410 --> 20:46.162
different about you.

20:46.204 --> 20:47.496
Did you get

20:47.538 --> 20:48.372
a haircut?

20:48.414 --> 20:49.790
Oh, very stylish.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.084
(chuckling)

20:51.125 --> 20:52.292
LOIS:

20:51.125 --> 20:52.292
Cynthia,

20:52.334 --> 20:53.293
did you like Europe?

20:53.335 --> 20:54.294
I did.

20:54.336 --> 20:55.504
I forget sometimes

20:55.546 --> 20:57.882
that there's a whole

20:55.546 --> 20:57.882
world out there

20:57.924 --> 21:01.135
that's not full

20:57.924 --> 21:01.135
of prurient,

20:57.924 --> 21:01.135
adolescent boys.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.887
There's sophisticated people

21:02.929 --> 21:05.806
who treat me nicely and

21:02.929 --> 21:05.806
keep their mouths shut.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.725
I get it.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.725
Oh...

21:08.768 --> 21:09.810
Yes?

21:09.852 --> 21:11.311
Is-Is Lois here?

21:11.353 --> 21:12.980
Honey?

21:11.353 --> 21:12.980
Oh, my God.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.190
Are you Lois' husband?

21:14.232 --> 21:15.315
Uh-huh.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.317
So, who is married

21:15.357 --> 21:17.317
to the bald guy

21:17.359 --> 21:18.318
with the earring?

21:18.360 --> 21:19.904
That's Donna.

21:19.946 --> 21:23.741
Darn it! I thought that was one

21:19.946 --> 21:23.741
house I didn't have to go to.

21:24.575 --> 21:26.368
Excuse me.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.328
Oh, yeah, and by the way,

21:28.370 --> 21:29.413
I lived in your house

21:29.455 --> 21:31.331
while you were on vacation

21:29.455 --> 21:31.331
last month.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.042
We didn't go on vacation.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.042
Darn it!
