As long as the Ambassador
refuses to allow an attack

00:16.245 --> 00:19.245
on the Justice meat
guarding the Key Chamber,

00:19.375 --> 00:22.575
the Crystal Key is useless to us,

00:24.250 --> 00:28.250
and the Warworld will never
truly belong to the Reach.

00:29.645 --> 00:31.545
Mongul is to blame.

00:31.642 --> 00:36.067
By bring the Warworld to Earth,
he cost us half our fleet.

00:36.145 --> 00:39.045
67.3%, actually.

00:39.215 --> 00:44.400
Rawr. And alerted the human meat
to our hidden invasion force.

00:44.475 --> 00:47.870
The Ambassador has ways
of handling the humans.

00:48.012 --> 00:50.337
And though we have
endured our setbacks,

00:50.400 --> 00:53.600
the Earth heroes
have lost so much more.

00:59.895 --> 01:03.195
All considered,
things progressed quite well.

01:03.291 --> 01:05.952
Except for one loose end.

01:06.020 --> 01:10.520
That loose end
will soon be cut off.

01:21.925 --> 01:25.425
Arsenal to Team. Come in.
Code Red, Code Red.

01:33.043 --> 01:35.683

And in addition to our joint
scientific advancements,

01:58.968 --> 02:02.995
the Earth has also gained
a new hero.

02:03.062 --> 02:07.079
One part human individual,
one part Reach technology.

02:07.126 --> 02:09.817
Blue Beetle

02:09.884 --> 02:13.615
of the peaceful union
between our peoples.

02:13.682 --> 02:17.290
Plus, he saved us all
from the Warworld.

02:17.337 --> 02:19.373
Not too shabby.

02:19.411 --> 02:21.910
[cheers and applause]

And this is only the beginning.

02:38.723 --> 02:42.384
Greetings, young one.
Do you have a question?

02:42.452 --> 02:46.579
Uh, I thought the Justice League
protected the Earth.

02:46.647 --> 02:49.386
Why didn't they stop
the Warworld?

02:49.441 --> 02:52.639
[sighs] I wonder about that, too.

02:52.707 --> 02:55.688
Just as I wonder
why they seem to attract

02:55.727 --> 02:59.098
so many outer space bullies
to your planet.

02:59.166 --> 03:03.826
Maybe the Warworld was a bully
too big for the League to handle.

03:03.893 --> 03:08.254
Good thing your new friends,
The Reach, were here to protect you.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.319
[cheers and applause]

03:12.317 --> 03:14.870
[squeaks]

03:14.901 --> 03:19.773
The threat that was the Warworld
is now a new hope for mankind;

03:19.808 --> 03:22.712
a weapon to defend your planet.

03:22.780 --> 03:27.071
We, The Reach, will safeguard
this weapon without boarding it,

03:27.102 --> 03:31.951
until such time as humanity
is ready to assume control.

03:32.014 --> 03:36.140
The Warworld is our gift to you.

Oh, nice one, Tye! You are seriously
getting a handle on your power.

04:20.834 --> 04:23.219
Thanks, Virgil.
But I'd rather get a handle

04:23.235 --> 04:27.297
on the scarab that turned my man Jaime
into The Reach's little blue puppet.

04:27.364 --> 04:29.776

04:29.935 --> 04:32.843

04:32.880 --> 04:35.362
<i>of their own creations
working against them.</i>

04:35.400 --> 04:38.957
Hey, they did not create us.
They kidnapped us.

04:38.988 --> 04:41.439
And experimented on us
against our will.

04:41.493 --> 04:45.593
<i>And with that in mind, if you truly
want to hit The Reach where it hurts,</i>

04:45.633 --> 04:48.221
<i>I believe
I can show you the way.</i>

04:53.946 --> 04:55.543
Anything?

04:56.012 --> 05:00.939
[sighs] No. I'm sorry.
I can't sense any of them.

05:00.963 --> 05:04.366
But the Warworld is so big,
they could easily be out of range.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.890
We've been flying this surface
grid pattern for hours.

05:06.928 --> 05:10.194
- And... and you're exhausted.
- I'm fine. I... I can do this.

05:10.230 --> 05:14.568
Of course. But there's no need to over-tax
yourself so soon after your kidnapping.

05:14.613 --> 05:16.714
Besides, we're not giving up.

05:16.762 --> 05:18.938
We'll start over where
the Team first disappeared.

05:19.006 --> 05:23.365

- All right. If you think it best.

Ha! That's what you get.

05:47.996 --> 05:49.268

Never!

06:18.819 --> 06:22.585
<i>It can open a Boom Tube, or gateway

06:22.616 --> 06:25.693
<i>It has also been programmed
to locate Kryptonian DNA.</i>

06:25.761 --> 06:29.597
Kryptonian? You mean you're
sending us after Superman?

- Those guys saved us from The Reach!
<i>- Precisely. Care to return the favor?</i>

06:39.632 --> 06:42.583
<i>And in the process, strike
a critical blow against The Reach?</i>

06:42.606 --> 06:46.914
Dude, you're asking us to go inside
the Warworld and rescue superheroes.

06:46.982 --> 06:49.417
If they got caught,
what chance do we have?

06:49.485 --> 06:52.119
[speaking native language]

06:52.155 --> 06:53.782
I'm in.

06:54.589 --> 06:56.654
There's no way
The Reach expects us.

06:56.686 --> 06:59.107
With the element of surprise
and our powers,

06:59.131 --> 07:01.360
we're the only ones who might
actually stand a chance.

07:01.361 --> 07:03.228
Besides, we owe 'em.

07:03.296 --> 07:04.923
<i>My thoughts exactly.</i>

07:04.949 --> 07:08.593
- [exhales] Fine.
- You had me at "We owe 'em".

07:10.037 --> 07:13.160

07:13.199 --> 07:16.209
How does work, please?

07:16.277 --> 07:18.746
<i>The Warworld shielding

<i>but it can Boom Tube you

<i>Once you're inside, it will lead you
directly to Superboy and the others.</i>

07:28.758 --> 07:31.678
<i>And when you're ready,

07:31.733 --> 07:34.663
<i>Simply ask, Asami,
and it will obey.</i>

Oh, we give up, we give up,
please don't hurt us!

08:09.717 --> 08:12.652
It was stupid to come here!
It was stupid, stupid, stupid!

08:12.720 --> 08:15.355
I knew this wouldn't work!
We are so sorry.

08:15.422 --> 08:16.777
He's right.

08:16.815 --> 08:19.520
We don't want any trouble.
We just want to go home.

Raw power. Now we're talking
the same language.

09:27.715 --> 09:30.815
And that's what you get
for blasting my board!

09:38.066 --> 09:42.666

long shadow was laser-proof?

09:42.731 --> 09:45.333
Ugh, more like laser-resistant.

[beep]

09:54.304 --> 09:55.904
This way.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.883
Haven't you already scanned
every inch of this place?

10:12.008 --> 10:15.483
Yeah, but I'm obviously capable
of missing obvious clues.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.075
I totally should have spotted
evidence of Blue Beetle's defection

10:18.095 --> 10:20.220
after Green Beetle
fixed his scarab.

10:20.260 --> 10:23.523
That's my fault. You asked
me to scan Green's mind,

10:23.530 --> 10:25.930
and I vouched for him
without delving deep.

10:26.022 --> 10:29.622
I was so afraid to use my powers
after what I did to Aqualad.

10:29.793 --> 10:32.729
I allowed Green Beetle
and his scarab to feed me

10:32.796 --> 10:35.506
exactly what The Reach
wanted us to believe.

10:35.555 --> 10:38.450
So Blue trusted Green
and was turned by him,

10:38.485 --> 10:40.686
then somehow abducted the Team.

10:40.904 --> 10:42.429
All on me.

10:42.570 --> 10:44.969
Except you never would've been
in that position

10:44.995 --> 10:48.095
if I had trusted you have with the
secret of Aqualad's deep cover mission.

10:48.120 --> 10:53.775
I put you, Aqualad, Artemis,
the whole Team, in unacceptable danger.

10:53.985 --> 10:56.630
So, this is our guilt-off.

10:56.719 --> 10:59.919
I say I messed up, then you
say you messed up worse.

11:00.091 --> 11:05.761
Dick, we both made mistakes,
and we both need to get over ourselves.

11:05.929 --> 11:08.684
Save the Team, then save Blue.

11:08.765 --> 11:11.817
As a certain 13-year-old
was once fond of saying,

11:11.839 --> 11:13.839
"That's just what we do."

11:15.505 --> 11:19.140

to Superboy?

11:36.058 --> 11:38.527
[revving]

11:41.398 --> 11:43.163
I think that's a "yes".

11:43.800 --> 11:48.838
<i>The meat-designated "Arsenal" continues
to elude Black Beetle soldiers.</i>

11:48.906 --> 11:51.174
<i>But of greater interest,</i>

<i>four of our former test subjects
are inside the Warworld</i>

11:54.915 --> 11:56.735
<i>and attacking our patrols.</i>

11:56.808 --> 11:58.318
What?! How did they get...

11:58.325 --> 12:01.825
- [knock on door] One minute, Mr. Ambassador.
- I'll be right with you.

12:01.900 --> 12:08.000
Tell Black to terminate both situations,
with extreme prejudice.

12:09.857 --> 12:13.732
<i>And now, an old friend
of our program...</i>

12:13.760 --> 12:16.710
<i>The Reach Ambassador.</i>

12:18.300 --> 12:23.400
<i>- Welcome back to the show, Ambassador.</i>
- Always a pleasure, G. Gordon.

12:31.814 --> 12:33.739
Oh, man.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.756
There they are.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.642
<i>Looks like they're frozen...</i>

12:40.521 --> 12:42.966
<i>They're in stasis.</i>

12:46.577 --> 12:49.832
And you will join them
soon enough.

12:59.355 --> 13:02.955
Guys, I saw this freak take down
all these heroes back on The Reach ship.

13:02.975 --> 13:06.875
<i>Please, don't let that
stop you from attacking me.</i>

13:06.900 --> 13:09.400
I could use the exercise.

13:20.151 --> 13:21.751
Aah!

13:23.400 --> 13:27.300
Please tell me he did not just take
our big gun in three seconds flat.

13:27.547 --> 13:29.047
Scatter!

13:29.672 --> 13:30.972
Aah!

13:32.037 --> 13:34.837
[all grunting]

13:36.505 --> 13:38.692
So much for exercise.

13:39.831 --> 13:44.536
All right, meat. Might as well
teleport yourself into a stasis cell

13:44.571 --> 13:47.273
and save me the trouble.

14:10.375 --> 14:13.839
<i>- Gracias, amigo.</i>
- Um, who are you?

14:13.855 --> 14:16.110
The guy who will save your
butts if you listen carefully.

14:16.127 --> 14:17.827
You can't beat
Black Beetle head on,

14:17.878 --> 14:20.678
but keep him off balance and we
might just stand a chance.

14:24.038 --> 14:29.476
So you see, G. Gordon, The Reach
is all about intergalactic brotherhood.

14:29.543 --> 14:31.812
A lovely sentiment.

14:31.879 --> 14:35.382
So, please explain
to the good folks at home

14:35.449 --> 14:38.808
how it squares with the lies
you told us

14:38.847 --> 14:43.356
and the fleet of warships
you hid beneath our oceans!

14:44.196 --> 14:47.994
I think you're forgetting
that those ships

14:48.062 --> 14:50.537
helped Blue Beetle
save the Earth from...

14:50.555 --> 14:54.175
<i>Unfortunately, The Reach
only has this single ship,</i>

14:54.269 --> 14:57.303
<i>designed for peaceful
exploration and diplomacy</i>

14:57.330 --> 14:59.999
<i>and unequipped
with any weapons.</i>

15:00.106 --> 15:05.378
Now, I don't know how you'd call that
on your world, Ambassador,

15:05.445 --> 15:10.355
but on planet Earth,
we call it a bold faced lie!

15:10.450 --> 15:14.290
How many more lies are you
hiding beneath our seas,

15:14.310 --> 15:19.430
and how much more propaganda
will you ask the human race to swallow

15:19.555 --> 15:23.629
and wash down
with a nice, cold <i>Reach?</i>

16:19.088 --> 16:21.743
I am starting to get annoyed.

16:26.025 --> 16:28.535
[computer dinging]
- Ugh, I really hate that sound!

16:28.610 --> 16:32.230
We're throwing everything we've got at
this desperado and barely holding our own.

16:32.235 --> 16:34.360
Shouldn't we be
freeing some of the good guys?

16:34.368 --> 16:35.668
No.

16:43.050 --> 16:45.050
[growls]

16:46.320 --> 16:50.320

on who we're here to rescue.

16:51.886 --> 16:54.184
Trust me, I'm clear.

Mongul!
This is all your fault!

[both grunting]

17:09.566 --> 17:12.665
You guys free the Team.
There's something else I need to get.

17:18.576 --> 17:20.844
[Spanish:]
<i>Free Superboy!</i>

17:45.605 --> 17:47.605
Let's go, move!

17:50.080 --> 17:51.680
Ok, get ready.

17:51.781 --> 17:54.881
There's a squad of Reach
soldiers waiting for us.

18:08.638 --> 18:10.938
Hey, fearless leader.
Better late than never.

18:10.986 --> 18:13.808
- Everyone safe?
- For now.

18:13.976 --> 18:18.286
- The crystal key?
- Gone. And we better get gone, too,

18:18.305 --> 18:19.960
before one of them
declares a winner.

18:19.992 --> 18:21.692
Right. Move out.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.900
<i>All aboard.
We're almost home free.</i>

18:30.381 --> 18:32.556
I think congratulations
are in order.

18:32.624 --> 18:36.003
No training, no guidance,
and yet you pulled it off.

18:36.034 --> 18:38.663
When we get back,
after a debrief,

18:38.730 --> 18:41.730
there might be a place
for all of you with the Team.

18:41.885 --> 18:43.585
Wow, really?

18:43.625 --> 18:45.350
So now that
we saved your butts,

18:45.375 --> 18:47.975
you're cool with us not being
S.T.A.R. Lab's guinea pigs.

18:48.073 --> 18:49.473
Dude, chill.

18:49.525 --> 18:51.894
Before we head back, we need
to talk about Blue Beetle.

18:52.019 --> 18:54.544
- He betrayed us.
- Look who's talking.

18:54.559 --> 18:57.694
Last thing I remember is you blowing
an airlock without warning.

18:57.762 --> 19:01.300
Nearly got us all killed and
absolutely guaranteed our capture!

19:01.347 --> 19:04.838
Hey! After 8 years on ice, there's
no way I was getting grabbed again.

19:04.867 --> 19:06.368
And in case you hadn't noticed,

19:06.435 --> 19:10.138
my escape resulted in you being free
now to stand here and complain.

19:10.206 --> 19:13.207
- So how about a "thank you"?
- You're right, Arsenal.

19:13.275 --> 19:14.809
Thank you.

19:14.877 --> 19:16.477
And after we get back to Earth,

19:16.545 --> 19:19.508
you're off the Team.

19:20.773 --> 19:22.733
- Well, wait a minute!
- If it wasn't for Arsenal,

19:22.742 --> 19:24.076
we wouldn't have rescued anyone.

19:24.143 --> 19:28.046
That may be. But this isn't the first
time he's pulled this kind of stunt.

19:28.114 --> 19:30.249
Intentionally endangering
the lives of teammates

19:30.316 --> 19:31.984
in order to further
his own agenda

19:32.052 --> 19:34.354
or guard against
his own personal demons.

19:34.421 --> 19:38.168
It's unacceptable. So until you
prove yourself a team player,

19:38.193 --> 19:40.772
you have no place on this Team.

19:40.828 --> 19:42.847
now let's get aboard
you and get out of here.

19:42.886 --> 19:46.072
We can discuss this further
when we're not behind enemy lines.

19:47.035 --> 19:50.138
Sounds like there's
nothing left to discuss.

19:50.205 --> 19:52.474
See, we don't need
your help getting back to Earth,

19:52.541 --> 19:54.676
<i>or your offer to join the Team.</i>

19:54.744 --> 19:57.012
We have our own way
of doing things.

19:57.080 --> 19:59.649
What do you say, bro,
want to ride with us?

19:59.716 --> 20:01.480
Sounds like a plan.

20:02.853 --> 20:04.987
- Wait, is that a...
- Home, please.

20:05.055 --> 20:06.456
[beeps]

20:15.433 --> 20:18.533
[all groaning]

20:18.637 --> 20:22.906
<i>So, am I right in thinking
congratulations are in order?</i>

20:23.073 --> 20:25.575
- Luthor!
<i>- Ahh...</i>

20:25.643 --> 20:28.028
<i>You brought home a souvenir.</i>

20:28.111 --> 20:31.036
Lex Luthor's got you running
his errands on the Warworld?!

20:31.167 --> 20:35.867
This guy's the reason I'm missing 8 years
of my life and my arm! Don't you get it?

20:35.952 --> 20:39.421
<i>He didn't care if you rescued the Team.
He was using you...</i>

20:39.889 --> 20:43.826
As a distraction to lure Black Beetle
away from the Crystal Key

20:43.893 --> 20:45.728
so one of his other pawns
could steal it.

20:45.795 --> 20:48.464
<i>Hmm, Deathstroke's
more of a bishop, actually.</i>

20:48.531 --> 20:51.033
<i>But I'm not sure
I understand the problem.</i>

20:51.100 --> 20:53.702
<i>You rescued the heroes
and dealt a blow to The Reach.</i>

20:53.770 --> 20:56.241
<i>Isn't that exactly
what I promised you?</i>

21:03.814 --> 21:06.214
No more promises.
