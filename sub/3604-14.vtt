00:15.308 --> 00:16.423
Mmm.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.927
Hello, Governor.

00:20.396 --> 00:22.978
Really? Is he on now?

00:25.484 --> 00:29.944
There are people who are
frank/y stunned by your
seeming/y meteoric rise.

00:30.031 --> 00:33.819
In the Senate less than three
months and already close/y
allied with the President on

00:33.910 --> 00:36.151
what many people
are calling
unprecedented access

00:36.245 --> 00:38.657
to the average American’s
most private details.

00:39.498 --> 00:42.240
Steve, I’m just
a humble junior senator
from New York.

00:42.335 --> 00:44.621
But as Chairman of
the Senate Commission
on Homeland Security,

00:44.712 --> 00:47.203
it’s my duty to
protect and serve
the people of America.

00:47.298 --> 00:50.756
I can assure you, Governor,
I don't know any more
about this than you do.

00:50.843 --> 00:53.175
Trust me,
that's ancient history.

00:53.262 --> 00:56.345
Haven't spoken to him
in close to two months.

00:57.642 --> 01:01.806
Now, if you don't mind,
I do have to get some sleep.

01:02.063 --> 01:03.052
(CHUCKLES)

01:05.650 --> 01:09.563
The rumors in Washington
are of frequent private
meetings at the White House,

01:09.654 --> 01:13.238
and the question on
everyone’s mind is,
"What are you discussing?"

01:13.324 --> 01:16.487
Well, again,
these are matters
of national security.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.364
We ’re protecting
the American people from
a very serious threat.

01:19.455 --> 01:20.865
Are we talking
about terrorism?

01:20.957 --> 01:23.164
Let me assure you,
the threat is real.

01:23.251 --> 01:24.741
We’re not out to alarm
the American public,

01:24.835 --> 01:27.372
but it’s important
that we take
precautionary measures.

01:31.801 --> 01:33.211
Senator, / don’t mean
to belabor this.

01:33.302 --> 01:36.794
Of course,
but the questions remain,
"Why you, why now?"

01:36.889 --> 01:39.096
Well, I’d love to go
into specifics with you,
Steve,

01:39.183 --> 01:41.344
but these are highly
classified discussions.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.808
There are those
that fear that what
you’re really talking about

01:46.899 --> 01:50.187
is taking away
civil liberties,
relaxing FlSA policies,

01:50.278 --> 01:52.269
expanding the reach
of the Patriot Act.
What about that?

01:53.322 --> 01:54.311

01:54.407 --> 01:56.568
Anyone who knows
my record and my career

I’ve devoted my life
to protecting people.

01:58.744 --> 02:01.451

passion for the protection
of an entire nation.

02:22.768 --> 02:23.883
Screw you.

02:23.978 --> 02:26.310
Is this about
your religious calling?

02:27.189 --> 02:28.975
I don't beg for anyone.

02:35.531 --> 02:37.817
After your
assassination attempt,
you made claims that

02:37.908 --> 02:39.694
God has a mission
for you.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.070
What do you want?

02:45.458 --> 02:48.074
Yes. / stand by
those comments.

I can do this.

at a normal life.

a chance at a normal life

out there?

there's some explanation.

away for days at a time,
going on "business trips."

about, protecting the country

talking about rounding up

in Memphis, he disappeared...
