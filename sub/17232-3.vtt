00:01.787 --> 00:03.404
Previously on <i>Nashville</i>

00:03.524 --> 00:05.273
You and Deacon should go out
on the road together...

00:05.393 --> 00:07.785
You and Deacon sleeping
on the same tour bus?

00:07.905 --> 00:09.371
You want me to say
I'm comfortable when I'm not?

00:09.491 --> 00:11.428
You know, we could do
a whole lot more of this

00:11.460 --> 00:13.046
if you'd just come on tour with me.

00:13.068 --> 00:14.764
You know I can't.
I'm going out with Rayna.

00:14.805 --> 00:17.393
You gotta focus on what your future holds.

00:17.425 --> 00:19.267
I saw these two kids
singing at the Bluebird.

00:19.294 --> 00:20.596
You get three songs together.

00:20.620 --> 00:22.558
I'll cut the demo for you myself.

00:22.927 --> 00:25.211
I think something about you
makes me want to grow up.

00:25.605 --> 00:27.671
I got a friend out there tonight,

00:27.711 --> 00:28.901
and I'd like to ask her to come up here

00:28.925 --> 00:29.906
and do a number with us.

00:29.941 --> 00:32.909

Hey, you got a sec?
What is going on with

01:17.738 --> 01:20.156
getting Deacon Claybourne on my tour?
That's probably not gonna happen.

01:20.190 --> 01:21.524
He and Rayna all but launched their tour

01:21.542 --> 01:23.026
last night at the Bluebird.

01:23.044 --> 01:25.212
Glenn, I want him, under contract.

01:25.246 --> 01:26.913
An exclusive contract.
Okay, we're gonna make him

01:26.964 --> 01:29.132
another offer...
an exclusive offer,

01:29.166 --> 01:30.584
but listen for a second.
I just got off the phone

01:30.635 --> 01:32.869
with the label.
Your mother showed up there.

01:35.339 --> 01:37.057
What are you talking about?

01:37.091 --> 01:39.676
When? A little while ago.

01:39.710 --> 01:42.095
She's looking for your address,
your phone number.

01:42.146 --> 01:44.481
I mean, nobody gave her
any information, but...

01:44.515 --> 01:45.999
But what?

01:47.768 --> 01:49.769
They gave her 100 bucks to leave.

01:54.108 --> 01:56.042
My mother is a drug addict.

01:56.077 --> 01:58.111
Nobody can give her anything, <i>ever.</i>

01:58.145 --> 02:00.797
Miss Barnes, they are ready on set.

02:00.831 --> 02:02.249
Okay.

02:04.518 --> 02:06.486
You are my manager.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.338
Deacon, my mom...

02:08.372 --> 02:09.940
Manage it.

02:15.313 --> 02:18.548
Maddie, get down here right now!
Your breakfast is getting cold.

02:18.583 --> 02:20.216
It's yogurt, mom.
It's <i>supposed</i> to be cold.

02:20.251 --> 02:21.301
Warm, then.

02:21.335 --> 02:22.552
Baby, have you seen my tie?

02:22.587 --> 02:24.954
The one with the little u's on it?
Maddie, now!

02:24.972 --> 02:26.456
Those are horseshoes, dad.
I knew that.

02:26.474 --> 02:27.924
What do you need a tie for,
honey? It's Joe.

02:27.958 --> 02:29.426
Yeah, I guess you're right.

02:29.460 --> 02:31.478
I have no idea what I'm gonna
wear for the talent show.

02:31.512 --> 02:32.738
Told you not to waste your
allowance on jeggings.

02:32.739 --> 02:33.963
Can we go to the mall?

02:33.981 --> 02:35.315
The mall? What do you
need to go to the mall for?

02:35.349 --> 02:36.816
Didn't your mama just buy you
a bunch of clothes?

02:36.851 --> 02:38.518
Brianna told me I needed to stop dressing

02:38.569 --> 02:39.736
like a sixth grader.

02:39.770 --> 02:41.955
She said seventh graders
show belly <i>and</i> side boob.

02:41.989 --> 02:45.191
Side <i>what</i> the hell did you just say?
That's a dollar.

02:45.226 --> 02:46.359
You know what?
No more side boob,

02:46.394 --> 02:48.995
no more ties. We gotta go <i>now.</i>

02:49.046 --> 02:50.380
All right. Have a good day
at school. Love you.

02:50.414 --> 02:51.815
Yours.

02:52.594 --> 02:54.561
My phone. Can you grab that
for me, babe, please?

02:54.579 --> 02:56.197
It's Deacon.

02:56.231 --> 02:58.482
Shoot.
Probably about the tour.

02:58.517 --> 03:00.534
You know what? I'll take the girls.

03:00.568 --> 03:02.436
Joe gets here before me, just tell
him I'll be right back. Okay.

03:02.471 --> 03:04.455
Hey.

03:04.489 --> 03:05.790
Hey. Is it a bad time?

03:05.824 --> 03:06.891
I can't really talk right now.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.208
It's... I got the girls and...

03:08.226 --> 03:09.777
Sorry. I was...

03:09.811 --> 03:12.121
Hell. That's my lawyer.

03:12.158 --> 03:14.042
You... you should get that.
Get... I'll call you later.

03:14.060 --> 03:15.110
All right, bye.

03:15.145 --> 03:17.079
No. No, no. I... Ray?

03:25.056 --> 03:26.256
Hey.

03:26.290 --> 03:27.757
Deacon. Hey, Wally.

03:27.791 --> 03:30.227
Juliette Barnes' manager's
been calling about the tour.

03:30.261 --> 03:33.130

04:29.887 --> 04:30.987
No, no, we were writing at Gunnar's,

04:31.021 --> 04:32.672
but his dog wouldn't stop barking, so...

04:32.723 --> 04:35.458
My dog hates blondes. Who knew?

04:36.450 --> 04:38.384
W-we've got
the meeting with Watty tomorrow.

04:38.402 --> 04:41.220
Right. Watty White. Yep.

04:41.255 --> 04:42.721
Hey, you killed it at
the 5 spot the other night.

04:42.739 --> 04:45.441
That guitar tone reminded me of Link Wray.

04:45.476 --> 04:46.609
Thanks, man.

04:49.296 --> 04:51.247
Well... good luck, then.

04:51.281 --> 04:55.451
I'll just be, In the bedroom.

04:55.502 --> 04:57.019
I'll try not to bark.

05:05.057 --> 05:06.908
Well, I wish I had better news for you,

05:06.942 --> 05:09.027
but you're still digging out
from the hit you took

05:09.061 --> 05:11.329
when Teddy's development went bust.

05:11.363 --> 05:13.431
You add to that recent campaign costs

05:13.465 --> 05:15.266
and expenses you won't be able to recoup

05:15.284 --> 05:16.935
without the income from the bigger tour.

05:16.969 --> 05:18.353
So bottom line, Joe.

05:18.387 --> 05:19.787
Stop spending money.

05:19.822 --> 05:21.873
Now at least the way you used to.

05:21.907 --> 05:24.792
You're gonna have to cut
your monthly nut in half,

05:24.827 --> 05:26.578
and if you don't, in a couple of months,

05:26.603 --> 05:28.020
you won't be able to cover it.

05:28.055 --> 05:31.824
You got assets.
They're just not liquid.

05:31.858 --> 05:33.749
Now another option
is to borrow on the house.

05:33.774 --> 05:36.993
You take out a line of credit.
That's a long shot.

05:37.027 --> 05:38.143
Hey, look, I-I'm in the middle
of a campaign.

05:38.162 --> 05:39.962
How's that gonna look to voters?

05:39.997 --> 05:41.814
Lot better than declaring bankruptcy.

05:43.050 --> 05:43.950
That's a joke.

05:43.984 --> 05:46.419
Well, we won't be doing <i>that.</i>

05:46.453 --> 05:48.120
I mean, there's this,

05:48.155 --> 05:49.639
and I hate to sound like a broken record

05:49.673 --> 05:51.224
about joining Juliette's tour...

05:51.258 --> 05:53.192
then don't be, Bucky.
No, Rayna, listen to me.

05:53.210 --> 05:55.578
You are just as valuable to her
as she is to you.

05:55.612 --> 05:57.613
Alone, she can sell out
one night at the garden.

05:57.648 --> 05:59.698
Together, you sell out three.

05:59.716 --> 06:00.800
Well, you know what?
I'm just really interested

06:00.834 --> 06:02.518
in hearing our other options, Bucky.

06:02.569 --> 06:05.371
Well, there's always
borrowing money from your daddy.

06:08.634 --> 06:12.620
Boy, y'all <i>really</i> need to get
some new material.

06:12.654 --> 06:13.938
Tea?

06:18.644 --> 06:20.278
What time again?

06:20.312 --> 06:21.529
Next time, can you make sure that you get

06:21.563 --> 06:22.813
the little individual cheeses?

06:22.847 --> 06:24.982
Like the square kind,
not the big ol' block.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.984
You mean the plastic,
processed kind, right?

06:27.002 --> 06:29.036
I mean the good kind, okay?

06:29.087 --> 06:31.806
Baby? Jolene.

06:31.890 --> 06:32.924
My God, baby, I'm so glad I found you.

06:32.925 --> 06:33.958
Hey, hey, why don't you come
talk to me for a second?

06:33.992 --> 06:35.193
- How you doing? All right?
- Yeah. I... yeah, I...

06:35.227 --> 06:36.777
Come on. Let's go.

06:36.812 --> 06:37.862
I just wanna talk to my daughter.

06:37.896 --> 06:39.013
I've come a really long way.

06:39.047 --> 06:40.464
I wanna tell you things
that's been going on.

06:44.219 --> 06:46.604
What do you wanna do?

06:46.638 --> 06:48.172
Let's just go.
Let's get outta here.

07:12.992 --> 07:14.576
All right, that's 14 solid tracks,

07:14.627 --> 07:15.794
but we still need to decide
about the other six.

07:15.828 --> 07:19.748
I'm not gonna lie.
I look <i>pretty good.</i>

07:19.799 --> 07:23.201
Those whitening strips really worked.
All right, I talked to Bo.

07:23.219 --> 07:25.036
We're upping your security team.
Hey, nothing about her schedule

07:25.071 --> 07:28.256
should be put in writing.
Just heard back from Deacon.

07:28.307 --> 07:29.874
Can't commit to anything exclusive.

07:29.892 --> 07:32.427
So given your terms,
sounds like a "no."

07:32.478 --> 07:34.763
Do you even know me?

07:34.797 --> 07:36.931
The answer is never "no."

07:36.966 --> 07:39.317
Why do I pay you if I have to do
everything myself?

07:39.352 --> 07:41.552
<i>This is Deacon.
Leave a message.</i>

07:41.570 --> 07:43.405
Deacon, it's me.
We're in the studio,

07:43.439 --> 07:45.357
and we're choosing tracks for the album,

07:45.391 --> 07:48.576
so if you want "undermine" on it,

07:48.611 --> 07:50.111
we really have to record it today.

07:50.162 --> 07:52.364
It's now or never.

08:01.257 --> 08:03.341
Joe Cocker, Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson...

08:03.376 --> 08:05.427
these people all really recorded
right here.

08:05.461 --> 08:06.711
On this very spot.

08:06.745 --> 08:07.962
My goodness.

08:08.014 --> 08:09.764
Step a little closer.
A little closer.

08:09.799 --> 08:11.433
Thank you. Here's
your headphones.

08:11.467 --> 08:12.467
Thank you.

08:14.186 --> 08:15.387
All right.
Let's make some music.

08:15.421 --> 08:17.389
Just tell me when you're ready.

08:17.423 --> 08:18.690
All right.

08:24.647 --> 08:25.780
You nervous?

08:25.815 --> 08:27.982
I'm shaking like a leaf on a tree.

08:40.462 --> 08:42.380
No. Wait. That was...

08:42.414 --> 08:43.498
I thought...

08:43.549 --> 08:44.582
<i>it's all right. Let's go again.</i>

08:44.616 --> 08:45.950
<i>No problem.</i>

08:54.844 --> 08:57.795
So we'll, kick it off
in Nashville at the Ryman,

08:57.813 --> 08:59.180
overnight on to Raleigh,

08:59.231 --> 09:02.567
then Richmond, D.C.,
Baltimore, Philly,

09:02.601 --> 09:03.985
two nights in New York at the beacon,

09:04.019 --> 09:05.987
and then Boston, Syracuse, Cleveland.

09:06.021 --> 09:07.272
We end that run in louisville,

09:07.306 --> 09:08.690
start the Western run the following week.

09:08.724 --> 09:11.309
So, lot of overnights,
long time away from home,

09:11.343 --> 09:13.812
long time for you to be away
from the girls, for you.

09:13.846 --> 09:15.663
But on the upside,

09:15.698 --> 09:17.382
we do have a brand-new bus,

09:17.416 --> 09:20.685
a nice master suite,
and... and decent bunks,

09:20.719 --> 09:22.837
so...
I guess that's about it.

09:22.872 --> 09:24.105
You guys good?

09:24.140 --> 09:26.124
Yeah, I'm good. Okay, great.

09:26.158 --> 09:28.343
Well, I will let you guys
get back to your set list.

09:28.394 --> 09:29.360
Thank you, buck.

09:29.395 --> 09:30.795
Thanks, babe. Yeah.

09:30.830 --> 09:33.138
Well, I'll check in with you
later, all right? Okay.

09:33.995 --> 09:36.864
All right. So, that's actually
pretty easy.

09:36.898 --> 09:38.749
I thought we'd just start by, you
know, going deep...

09:38.800 --> 09:40.467
And starting with some of
those early ones stripped down

09:40.485 --> 09:42.887
like, "don't leave without me,"

09:42.921 --> 09:44.438
"that could be us."

09:44.473 --> 09:47.558
What if we were to just
throw it on its ear

09:47.592 --> 09:48.676
with something...
Completely different.

09:48.694 --> 09:50.628
Focus on the big songs,

09:50.662 --> 09:52.229
like "already gone"
or "last stand," you know.

09:52.264 --> 09:54.215
I mean, yeah, we can do anything

09:54.249 --> 09:56.484

Don't got any backup singers,

09:59.938 --> 10:01.389
so I just think we'd do better

10:01.423 --> 10:03.891
just doing the things
like we did the other night

10:03.925 --> 10:06.594
and "no one will ever love you"
type thing.

10:07.696 --> 10:09.797

21:24.728 --> 21:28.197

22:03.118 --> 22:04.135
Think about how good it would be

22:04.170 --> 22:07.472
to just leave everything here behind.

22:07.507 --> 22:09.140
I mean, we'd be out on the road

22:09.175 --> 22:11.743
and playing for sold out venues.

22:11.794 --> 22:13.712
Screaming fans.

22:13.763 --> 22:16.915
And then when we weren't,
we could be writing songs.

22:16.949 --> 22:19.201
I mean...

22:19.235 --> 22:22.487
That song today...
that wasn't just any old song.

22:25.111 --> 22:28.613
No. It wasn't.

22:28.647 --> 22:32.466
You know, that could be
just the beginning.

22:32.485 --> 22:37.438
I mean, if you had
to make a decision right now.

22:37.473 --> 22:38.790
Right now?

22:38.824 --> 22:39.874
<i>Right</i> now.

22:39.909 --> 22:41.276
Right now.

22:41.310 --> 22:43.595
Well...

22:43.629 --> 22:46.264
Right now it doesn't sound half bad.

22:46.298 --> 22:47.816
No?

22:47.850 --> 22:50.018
No.

22:54.056 --> 22:57.192
Very nice.

So I heard that daddy offered
to give you and Teddy a loan.

24:38.842 --> 24:40.460
I hate it. I hate
the whole idea of that.

24:40.494 --> 24:41.611
And you know,

24:41.645 --> 24:43.646
now this whole thing
with daddy and my career.

24:43.697 --> 24:46.933
What is his problem with me and my career?

24:46.967 --> 24:52.271
He hates your career because of mom.

24:52.305 --> 24:55.291
Why because of mom?

24:55.342 --> 24:57.627
Mom had a friend.

24:57.661 --> 25:00.096
A singer/songwriter friend.

25:04.392 --> 25:05.892
You mean like an affair?

25:08.045 --> 25:09.846
It was more than an affair.

25:09.864 --> 25:12.248
They were together for over ten years.

25:12.283 --> 25:14.768
They were together right up
until the time she died.

25:14.819 --> 25:16.836
How do you know this?

25:16.871 --> 25:18.872
I read some letters after she died.

25:18.906 --> 25:20.389
I think her relationship with him

25:20.408 --> 25:23.460
is what made her marriage
to daddy work. It was like...

25:23.494 --> 25:27.247
The two men together
somehow made a whole marriage.

25:27.281 --> 25:29.499
How...

25:29.517 --> 25:31.818
How could you not have ever told me this?

25:31.852 --> 25:34.187
'Cause I didn't wanna
hurt your memory of mom.

25:36.465 --> 25:39.384
So your career and all of this...

25:39.418 --> 25:42.120
it just...

25:42.154 --> 25:44.272
It just pushes a button in him.

25:57.820 --> 26:01.038
Baby, just a few minutes. Gotta punch out.

26:01.057 --> 26:03.358
Take your time.

26:03.392 --> 26:05.760
Hey, man. You want a beer?

26:05.795 --> 26:07.495
Ll, if you're buying.

26:11.867 --> 26:14.419
So she still seems a little shaken up,

26:15.788 --> 26:17.288
About the Watty thing.

26:17.306 --> 26:18.773
What Watty thing?

26:18.808 --> 26:20.675
She didn't tell you?

26:20.710 --> 26:22.260
Didn't tell me what?

26:22.294 --> 26:24.028
She choked in the session.

26:24.046 --> 26:26.181
What happened?

26:26.215 --> 26:28.817
Well, to be honest, just to say it,

26:28.851 --> 26:30.518
I think it might have
something to do with you.

26:30.553 --> 26:33.722
I think she feels like if
she really goes after it,

26:33.756 --> 26:37.258
you might, you know, leave her.

26:37.293 --> 26:39.027
That's ridiculous.

26:39.061 --> 26:40.945
I know.

26:51.440 --> 26:55.210
I bet you did.

26:55.261 --> 26:58.430
Really?

26:59.901 --> 27:01.218
Knock, knock.

27:02.604 --> 27:05.589
Yeah, yeah, the... the 22nd
oughta work out fine.

27:05.623 --> 27:07.057
Listen, let... let me,

27:07.091 --> 27:09.109
let me call you back, all right?

27:12.247 --> 27:15.515
Well... I didn't expect
to see you

27:15.549 --> 27:17.501
after that... display
last night.

27:17.535 --> 27:20.270
You're not... carrying
any weapons, are you?

27:20.305 --> 27:21.955
No, I'm unarmed.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.276
All right. So...

27:26.311 --> 27:27.527
What can I do for ya?

27:27.545 --> 27:30.581
Well... I had a conversation
with Tandy,

27:30.615 --> 27:33.784
and she told me about mom.

27:37.655 --> 27:39.840
And her affair.

27:41.619 --> 27:43.187
And I wish I had known.

27:43.221 --> 27:45.339
I wish you had told me. Now
what is there to talk about?

27:45.373 --> 27:46.857
What is the point?

27:46.891 --> 27:48.559
Well, the point is that you disappeared.

27:49.577 --> 27:51.778
As soon as mama died, you were gone.

27:51.829 --> 27:53.413
You were out the door. You were
off on some business trip,

27:53.448 --> 27:55.582
or you were overseas,
anywhere but at home.

27:55.616 --> 27:57.517
You've been absent my whole life

27:57.552 --> 28:00.036
except for being just furious at me

28:00.071 --> 28:01.304
for the choices that I've made,

28:01.339 --> 28:02.723
for the road that I've gone down.

28:02.757 --> 28:06.876
You have never been supportive,
and I have never understood why.

28:06.894 --> 28:08.145
Unless I'm mistaken,

28:08.179 --> 28:10.247
I did pay for your first record, didn't I?

28:10.281 --> 28:12.849
I mean, some people
might call that supportive.

28:12.884 --> 28:14.452
I never knew that you did that.

28:14.572 --> 28:16.973
You told me about it 20 years later.

28:17.007 --> 28:19.742
Rayna...
You are still my daughter,

28:19.760 --> 28:21.695
and believe it or not,
I care about your happiness.

28:21.729 --> 28:25.215
I only wish you didn't put it
ahead of your own family's.

28:25.249 --> 28:27.801
That's a similarity that
you seem to unfortunately

28:27.835 --> 28:29.519
have inherited from your mother.

28:29.553 --> 28:31.755
You've proven to have the same disregard

28:31.789 --> 28:36.176
for your marriage that she did for ours.

28:38.896 --> 28:41.831
I am so sorry that she hurt you, daddy.

28:41.849 --> 28:44.784
But I have to say,
if you... treated her

28:44.819 --> 28:47.687
the way you've treated me...

28:48.959 --> 28:51.060
I don't see how she would have
had any choice

28:51.094 --> 28:52.962
but to do what she did.

28:56.916 --> 28:59.568
Thanks for this reminder.

28:59.603 --> 29:01.670
I'd never take a penny from you.

29:14.117 --> 29:16.168
What?

29:16.202 --> 29:18.437
This is security at the front gate.

29:18.471 --> 29:21.290
Someone's here insisting she's your guest.

29:27.847 --> 29:30.232
Is that right?
There's my baby right there.

29:32.293 --> 29:34.828
Get off of me.

29:34.846 --> 29:36.163
There's my ba... baby!

29:36.197 --> 29:37.864
Can't do it. She's my daughter.
Get off of me!

29:37.898 --> 29:39.733
Mom? Thank God, baby.

29:39.751 --> 29:41.885
You've gotta tell 'em I'm your mama.

29:41.919 --> 29:43.920
You've got to go home. You can't
just show up here like this.

29:43.971 --> 29:45.272
Baby, I'm clean.
I swear to God.

29:45.306 --> 29:46.990
It's been over two weeks.
I'm clean.

29:47.041 --> 29:49.559
Come on. I've heard that
a million times.

29:49.594 --> 29:52.362
Baby, look, Tyler and I got into a fight.

29:52.413 --> 29:54.581
He took all the money I had,
and he just left.

29:54.615 --> 29:57.601
I had to hitchhike to get here.
I've got nowhere to go.

29:57.652 --> 30:00.587
You can't stay here.
Do you understand that?

30:00.621 --> 30:01.672
I can't do this.

30:01.706 --> 30:04.107
You can't help your mama?
I raised you!

30:04.142 --> 30:05.442
No, not when you were still using.

30:05.476 --> 30:07.861
I can tell just by looking at you.

30:07.879 --> 30:09.596
I'm not using!

30:11.649 --> 30:14.451
Listen to me. I do not
wanna cause a scene.

30:14.485 --> 30:15.602
You've gotta go.

30:15.620 --> 30:16.903
Baby, I am begging you.

30:18.539 --> 30:22.576
I got no one else.
I got nowhere to go!

30:22.610 --> 30:24.578
I'm your mama.

30:26.297 --> 30:29.115
I need... I need you.

30:29.133 --> 30:32.219
Yeah, well, there was a time

30:32.253 --> 30:34.588
when I needed you, too.

30:37.141 --> 30:39.459
Please put her on a bus.
Send her home. Something.

30:39.477 --> 30:41.895
She cannot stay here. Got it.

30:41.929 --> 30:46.800
Let go. I'm your mama!
I'm your mama! I'm your mama!

30:46.818 --> 30:50.937
And I need you to leave.
Get off of me. Get...

31:09.148 --> 31:10.414
Hey.

31:10.433 --> 31:12.667
Hey. All good?

31:12.701 --> 31:14.302
It's all great.

31:18.941 --> 31:20.525
Thank you.

31:34.490 --> 31:36.458
You want some breakfast?

31:36.509 --> 31:37.875
I could make something.

31:37.893 --> 31:39.310
Or order something.

31:43.215 --> 31:44.315
Actually,

31:44.350 --> 31:47.051
I have to get goin'. Gotta...

31:47.085 --> 31:48.686
got a bunch of phone calls
I gotta make, stuff like that.

31:48.720 --> 31:50.188
But... All right.

31:50.222 --> 31:52.474
Thanks for everything, though.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.003
Hey.

32:13.021 --> 32:14.305
Hey.

32:14.339 --> 32:16.907
I would really love to talk
if you still, you know...

32:16.942 --> 32:18.759
If that's cool.

32:18.794 --> 32:19.794
Sure.

32:19.845 --> 32:21.779
In person? Yeah, sure.

32:28.970 --> 32:30.654
Teddy freakin' Conrad.

32:30.689 --> 32:32.189
Future mayor of Nashville.

32:32.223 --> 32:34.025
Well, that's the plan.

32:34.059 --> 32:35.259
How the hell have you been?

32:35.293 --> 32:36.660
I'm doing all right.
You're looking good.

32:36.694 --> 32:37.694
So how's Elaine?

32:37.713 --> 32:38.962
Fourth time's a charm.

32:38.980 --> 32:40.314
I'm glad to hear it. Yeah?

32:40.365 --> 32:41.665
Rayna and the girls...
they good?

32:41.699 --> 32:43.467
Fantastic. Growing like weeds.
You know how that goes.

32:43.485 --> 32:45.886
Yeah. So... what can I do
for you, my man?

32:45.921 --> 32:49.156
Well... I'd like to look into
taking out a line of credit.

32:50.207 --> 32:52.459
Campaigns... you know,
they can suck you dry.

32:52.493 --> 32:54.361
Gotta warn you, qualifying these days...

32:54.395 --> 32:56.146
bigger bitch than my third wife.

32:56.180 --> 32:58.031
But I'll do what I can,

32:58.082 --> 32:59.349
Appreciate that.

32:59.383 --> 33:00.767
Only thing... we're,
we're backlogged a little.

33:00.818 --> 33:03.520
Our friends, the feds,
decided to waste everyone's time

33:03.554 --> 33:04.821
with an audit.

33:06.040 --> 33:07.123
An audit?

33:08.859 --> 33:10.827
How far back?

33:10.861 --> 33:11.994
All the way back to '08.

33:12.012 --> 33:14.447
You remember the good old days.

33:14.482 --> 33:16.716
The good old days.
Yeah. For you, maybe.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.866
So let's get you started
on some paperwork.

33:20.900 --> 33:24.186
Listen, I...
I hate to waste your time,

33:24.220 --> 33:25.404
but, now that I'm thinking about it,

33:25.438 --> 33:27.422
I should probably talk to Rayna first.

33:27.457 --> 33:29.891
'Nuff said.
I'm here when you're ready.

33:29.909 --> 33:32.611
I appreciate that.
I'll give you a shout.

33:32.645 --> 33:34.730
Well, I hope you'll be hungry
for the same thing

33:34.764 --> 33:36.982
I've made every night this week.

33:37.033 --> 33:39.585
You know what? Forget dinner.
What?

33:39.619 --> 33:41.987
Come on. What are you doing?
Stop it.

33:42.038 --> 33:43.889
Stand right there. What?

33:43.923 --> 33:45.474
This.

33:45.508 --> 33:49.044
Just stand there.

33:50.332 --> 33:51.632
Sing to me.

33:51.650 --> 33:53.701
No. Come on.

33:53.735 --> 33:55.803
No. In the middle
of the living room with a whisk.

33:55.838 --> 33:56.788
You gone crazy?

33:56.822 --> 33:58.039
No crazier than Watty White

33:58.073 --> 34:00.141
thinking anyone but you should
be singing on that demo.

34:00.159 --> 34:02.177
You've been talking to Gunnar?

34:02.211 --> 34:03.695
He may have mentioned it in passing.

34:03.729 --> 34:05.029
All right.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.848
The water is boiling.

34:06.882 --> 34:08.433
I don't care. Let it boil.
No. Would you please stop?

34:08.467 --> 34:09.617
Don't make me do this.
It was horrible.

34:09.652 --> 34:10.885
I was horrible.
That's not possible.

34:10.902 --> 34:12.402
No, awful. Ask Gunnar.
Everybody was staring.

34:12.454 --> 34:14.255
That's what people do, Scarlett.

34:14.273 --> 34:16.373
They stare. I mean, everyone was
staring at you at the Bluebird,

34:16.408 --> 34:18.592
and you did just fine. This
felt completely different.

34:18.627 --> 34:19.878
I was standing on the spot

34:19.911 --> 34:22.530
where everybody who is anybody
has recorded,

34:22.565 --> 34:24.599
and I'm thinking, what...
what am I doing here?

34:24.617 --> 34:26.751
I don't belong here. Who...
who am I to get to stand here

34:26.784 --> 34:27.886
and try to do this?

34:27.937 --> 34:29.320
That... that's your first mistake
right there.

34:30.755 --> 34:33.174
This isn't about you.

34:33.208 --> 34:37.728
Look, the songs came from you.

34:37.763 --> 34:39.563
But getting 'em out there...

34:39.598 --> 34:41.431
that's about somethin' bigger.

34:41.483 --> 34:46.054
It's... it's a piece of you
that you're, like,

34:46.088 --> 34:48.339
obligated to share.

34:49.795 --> 34:52.047
Baby, you've gotta take the pressure off.

34:52.065 --> 34:54.882
All you are is the way
the music gets heard.

34:54.917 --> 34:56.851
Now come on.
Just forget everyone else.

34:56.886 --> 34:59.988
Imagine it's just you and me
in that studio.

35:00.022 --> 35:02.007
Hell, I'll even be there if you want.

35:03.609 --> 35:06.745
Now come on. Forget about
doing it for yourself.

35:08.231 --> 35:10.415
Do it for me.

35:21.748 --> 35:24.616
So the good news is
Deacon's got the contract.

35:24.650 --> 35:28.804
All right.
And what's the bad news?

35:28.838 --> 35:31.807
The bad news is that
your mom got picked up

35:31.841 --> 35:34.042
downtown near the bus depot.

35:34.077 --> 35:36.812
Apparently, she got
into some kind of altercation,

35:36.846 --> 35:39.247
stole some food. I don't know.

35:39.282 --> 35:42.033
They found a handful of oxy on her.

35:42.068 --> 35:43.952
Now look, I know that this is
probably the last place

35:43.986 --> 35:45.771
that you want her,

35:45.805 --> 35:47.038
but until we can figure out a way

35:47.073 --> 35:50.358
to either get her into rehab
or ship her back to Alabama,

35:50.393 --> 35:53.628
I feel like she's gonna cause
a lot more trouble out there

35:53.679 --> 35:55.847
than she could in here.

36:01.192 --> 36:03.077
I'm not avoiding you.

36:03.128 --> 36:05.246
I just don't know what to say.

36:05.297 --> 36:06.981
It's my fault. I don't know
why I'm forcing you to say it

36:07.015 --> 36:09.083
in the first place.

36:09.117 --> 36:11.419
Say what? Why don't you say it?

36:13.088 --> 36:16.023
The only thing you <i>can</i> say, Ray.

36:17.943 --> 36:20.144
That it's all over.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.968
I feel like that's what
I need to be saying, you know?

36:27.019 --> 36:29.020
I need to...

36:29.054 --> 36:32.289
Be letting you go, move on with your life.

36:32.307 --> 36:33.624
Go do that damn tour if you want to.

36:33.642 --> 36:37.378
You know, whatever. I'm just...

36:37.429 --> 36:40.915
So why don't you, Ray?

36:40.949 --> 36:46.603
Because you and music...

36:46.622 --> 36:48.239
There's no difference, you know.

36:48.273 --> 36:51.442
It's the same.

36:51.476 --> 36:53.995
And I feel like I'm holding
these hearts in my hands,

36:54.029 --> 36:57.214
and I'm trying real hard not to break 'em.

37:00.686 --> 37:03.654
But my heart's in pieces.

37:09.618 --> 37:11.335
And I'm trying to do the right thing,

37:11.370 --> 37:15.106
but none of it feels right to me.

37:18.694 --> 37:20.394
Okay.

37:24.333 --> 37:26.567
