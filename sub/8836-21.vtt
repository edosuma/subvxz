27:11.923 --> 27:13.425
GOOD DAY.

27:13.591 --> 27:14.676
CAN I HELP YOU,
MR. WHIPPLE?

27:14.843 --> 27:17.095
UH, YES. I WAS LOOKING
FOR THE MORPHINE.

27:17.262 --> 27:19.931
OH, I'M AFRAID
WE DON'T HAVE ANY.

27:20.098 --> 27:22.434
UH, SOME LAUDANUM, THEN.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.145
WELL, WE HAVEN'T STOCKED
ANY HEAVY PAINKILLERS--

27:25.312 --> 27:28.982
NO OPIUM OR MORPHINE--
FOR MORE THAN A YEAR NOW.

27:29.149 --> 27:31.443
WELL, I NEVER HEARD OF A STORE
THAT DIDN'T CARRY MORPHINE.

27:31.609 --> 27:33.820
NOW, WHAT DO PEOPLE
AROUND HERE DO FOR PAIN?

27:33.987 --> 27:35.780
YOU HAVE TO SEE
DR. BAKER NOW.

27:35.947 --> 27:39.034
HE'S THE ONE THAT ASKED US TO
TAKE THOSE DRUGS OFF THE SHELF.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.661
SAYS THAT FOLKS
THAT USE THAT STUFF

27:41.828 --> 27:43.288
ARE LIABLE TO HURT
THEMSELVES WORSE

27:43.455 --> 27:45.123
THAN WHAT WAS PAINING THEM
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

27:45.290 --> 27:47.917
AND, UH, WHERE-- WHERE
WOULD I FIND HIM?

27:48.084 --> 27:50.462
HIS OFFICE IS DOWN
BEHIND THE POST OFFICE.

27:50.628 --> 27:52.839
I SAW HIM EARLIER,
SO HE OUGHT TO BE THERE.

27:53.006 --> 27:54.674
WELL, LISTEN, IF
YOU'RE NOT TOO BAD OFF,

27:54.841 --> 27:56.301
I GOT SOME HEADACHE
POWDERS HERE.

27:56.468 --> 27:57.886
SOME FOLKS SAY
THEY'RE PRETTY GOO--

28:09.314 --> 28:11.816
MR. WHIPPLE,
I WOULD LIKE TO PLAY--

28:11.983 --> 28:12.984
I THOUGHT
I MADE IT CLEAR.

28:13.151 --> 28:15.653
I DON'T INTEND
TO TEACH THE BUGLE.

28:15.820 --> 28:17.364
WELL, I JUST WANT TO SHOW
IT TO YOU, THAT'S ALL.

28:17.530 --> 28:18.698
I THOUGHT MAYBE
THAT YOU'D--

28:18.865 --> 28:20.825
NOW, LISTEN, I DON'T
CARE WHAT YOU THOUGHT.

28:20.992 --> 28:23.578
I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

28:30.835 --> 28:32.128
I'M SORRY.

28:33.380 --> 28:36.549
ROY, ROY, ROY,
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

29:01.491 --> 29:03.410
NO INFLAMMATION.

29:03.576 --> 29:06.704
APPEARS THE SURGEON
DID A FINE JOB.

29:06.871 --> 29:07.831
SHRAPNEL?

29:07.997 --> 29:09.916
UM, YES--AT SHILOH.

29:10.083 --> 29:13.461
I HANDLED A FEW
OF THOSE MYSELF.

29:13.628 --> 29:15.213
YOU CAN PUT
YOUR SHOE BACK ON.

29:20.343 --> 29:24.722
THAT'S A LONG TIME FOR IT
TO BE CAUSING YOU PAIN.

29:24.889 --> 29:26.683
WHAT DO YOU USE FOR IT?

29:26.850 --> 29:27.976
UH--UH, MORPHINE.

29:30.186 --> 29:32.689
THAT'S A HEAVYWEIGHT
PAINKILLER FOR A LEG ACHE.

29:32.856 --> 29:37.735
WELL, I--l-- I HAVEN'T TAKEN
ANY IN ABOUT 9 MONTHS.

29:37.902 --> 29:39.904
GOOD.

29:40.071 --> 29:41.531
I'LL GET YOU
SOMETHING FOR IT.

29:45.702 --> 29:49.247
THIS IS A NEW PRESCRIPTION THEY'VE
BEEN USING UP IN ROCHESTER,

29:49.414 --> 29:52.083
HANDLES MOST PAIN
PRETTY WELL.

29:52.250 --> 29:53.626
IT'S NOT MORPHINE.

29:53.793 --> 29:57.297
NO, NO, BUT IT DOESN'T CAUSE
THE PROBLEMS MORPHINE DOES.

29:57.464 --> 29:59.007
I TOLD YOU I NEED--I
NEED MORPHINE.

29:59.174 --> 30:01.509
YOU ALSO TOLD ME YOU HADN'T
TAKEN ANY FOR 9 MONTHS.

30:01.676 --> 30:03.386
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.
I HAVEN'T HAD ANY.

30:03.553 --> 30:05.513
MR. WHIPPLE,

30:05.680 --> 30:09.851
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH DEPENDENCE
ON DRUGS TO READ THE SIGNS.

30:10.018 --> 30:11.186
LOOK AT YOUR HAND.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.607
ABOUT THE ONLY WAY YOU'LL
STOP THAT TREMBLING FOR GOOD

30:15.773 --> 30:18.276
IS TO FIGHT IT THROUGH
WITHOUT MORPHINE.

30:18.443 --> 30:20.195
YOU DON'T CARE.
YOU DON'T CARE.

30:20.361 --> 30:22.489
YOU DOCTORS CAUSE IT,
AND YOU DON'T CARE.

30:22.655 --> 30:24.574
OH, I CARE.

30:24.741 --> 30:26.201
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:26.367 --> 30:29.370
WE DIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT
MORPHINE, AND WE STILL DON'T,

30:29.537 --> 30:32.874
BUT I DO KNOW WHAT lT'LL DO FOR
YOU IF YOU TAKE IT LONG ENOUGH.

30:34.751 --> 30:36.794
YOU CAN'T KNOW.

30:36.961 --> 30:38.129
YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN THERE.

30:42.383 --> 30:44.302
TAKE THIS.

30:44.469 --> 30:46.137
TRY.

30:46.304 --> 30:47.597
AND I'LL HELP YOU
ANY WAY I CAN.

30:47.764 --> 30:49.891
UH-HUH, NOW KEEP YOUR
MEDICINE, DOCTOR.

30:50.058 --> 30:51.518
I'LL GET--
I'LL GET MY OWN.

31:04.822 --> 31:06.407
Charles: MARY?

31:06.574 --> 31:08.993
BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU.
TIME FOR SUPPER.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.870
ALL RIGHT, PA.

31:11.037 --> 31:13.206
WHERE'S YOUR LITTLE PIANO?
DID YOU FORGET IT?

31:13.373 --> 31:15.124
I LEFT IT
AT MRS. WHIPPLE'S.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.043
I'M NOT GOING
TO PLAY ANYMORE.

31:18.378 --> 31:19.796
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO PLAY? WHY NOT?

31:21.172 --> 31:22.924
I'D JUST AS SOON
NOT TALK ABOUT IT, PA.

31:26.135 --> 31:28.846
ALL RIGHT. GET
YOUR BOOKS AND COME ON.

31:29.013 --> 31:30.640
PA?

31:30.807 --> 31:32.475
WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN
YOU LIKE SOMEONE

31:32.642 --> 31:34.644
AND IT TURNS OUT THEY JUST
DON'T LIKE YOU AT ALL?

31:38.815 --> 31:40.024
WELL, MARY, I MIGHT
BE ABLE TO TELL YOU

31:40.191 --> 31:42.986
IF I HAD SOME IDEA
WHO THIS SOMEONE WAS.

31:45.613 --> 31:47.532
MR. WHIPPLE.

31:47.699 --> 31:49.367
HE JUST HATES ME.

31:49.534 --> 31:50.535
COME ON.
YOU CAN'T MEAN THAT.

31:50.702 --> 31:53.037
HE TOLD ME YOU WERE
HIS PRIZE STUDENT.

31:53.204 --> 31:55.331
NOT ANYMORE.

31:55.498 --> 31:57.500
I MADE A MISTAKE
ON THE MUSIC SHEETS,

31:57.667 --> 32:00.044
AND I TRIED TO TELL
HIM I WAS SORRY.

32:00.211 --> 32:03.047
HE WOULDN'T
EVEN LISTEN!

32:03.214 --> 32:06.384
HE NEVER WANTS TO
SEE ME AGAIN--EVER.

32:06.551 --> 32:08.177
ARE YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T
MISUNDERSTAND HIM?

32:08.344 --> 32:10.096
YOU DIDN'T
SEE HIM, PA.

32:10.263 --> 32:11.556
HE WAS SO ANGRY.

32:15.268 --> 32:16.227
WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU, MARY.

32:16.394 --> 32:18.187
WE ALL HAVE
OUR BAD DAYS SOMETIMES,

32:18.354 --> 32:20.565
AND DAYS WE JUST
CAN'T GET ALONG.

32:20.732 --> 32:22.483
WE SAY AN AWFUL LOT
OF THINGS WE DON'T MEAN.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.862
YOU DON'T THINK
HE MEANT IT?

32:26.029 --> 32:28.281
I'M SURE HE DIDN'T.

32:28.448 --> 32:30.700
MR. WHIPPLE'S GONE THROUGH AN
AWFUL LOT OF SADNESS IN HIS LIFE,

32:30.867 --> 32:32.535
WHAT WITH THE WAR.

32:32.702 --> 32:36.581
HE'S MOVED TO A NEW TOWN. HE'S
TRYING TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS.

32:36.748 --> 32:40.501
I THINK THOSE NEW FRIENDS ARE GOING
TO HAVE TO BE PATIENT WITH HIM.

32:40.668 --> 32:42.253
I WANT TO BE HIS FRIEND.

32:42.420 --> 32:43.880
AND HE WANTS
TO BE YOURS.

32:44.047 --> 32:45.840
I'LL BET YOU HE TELLS YOU
FIRST CHANCE HE GETS.

32:48.051 --> 32:49.427
THINK SO?

32:49.594 --> 32:50.678
I KNOW IT.

32:54.932 --> 32:56.809
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE SMILE
BEFORE SUPPER, HUH?

32:59.270 --> 33:00.521
THAT'S BETTER.
COME ON.

33:13.117 --> 33:14.202
[DOOR BANGS]

35:23.915 --> 35:24.999
UHH!

35:57.490 --> 35:59.700
GRANVILLE? SON?

36:07.625 --> 36:08.709
GRANVILLE.

37:07.143 --> 37:09.437
MAMA, DON'T.

37:09.604 --> 37:10.688
DON'T...

37:13.691 --> 37:15.610
PLEASE?

37:15.776 --> 37:17.737
OH, GRANVILLE!

37:24.076 --> 37:26.203
L--l NEED IT, MA.

37:40.593 --> 37:43.387
NOW WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO?

37:43.554 --> 37:46.807
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
TO FIND THE BLAME.

37:46.974 --> 37:48.809
YOU WERE DOING SO WELL.

37:50.561 --> 37:52.688
IT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU, MA.

37:54.899 --> 37:58.903
IS IT--IS IT
YOUR LEG, SON?

37:59.070 --> 38:00.947
IT MUST BE
IN TERRIBLE PAIN

38:01.113 --> 38:04.075
TO THROW AWAY
9 MONTHS OF TRYING.

38:04.241 --> 38:07.787
UH-HUH. MAMA,
I'M SORRY, BUT I, UH...

38:07.954 --> 38:11.248
MAMA, I GOTTA--I GOTTA
GO AWAY.

38:11.415 --> 38:13.084
GO AWAY?

38:13.250 --> 38:16.420
YOU WERE SO HAPPY HERE.

38:16.587 --> 38:19.173
L--l WA--I WAS
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.301
WELL, THERE
MUST BE A REASON.

38:22.468 --> 38:25.596
MA, I--PLEASE.

38:25.763 --> 38:28.891
YOU TELL ME I'M GOING
TO LOSE MY SON AGAIN,

38:29.058 --> 38:31.936
AND YOU WON'T EVEN
TELL ME THE REASON WHY?

38:32.103 --> 38:34.814
HEY, MA--
MA, THIS.

38:34.981 --> 38:35.898
THIS SHOULD
BE ENOUGH.

38:36.065 --> 38:37.024
YES, THAT!

38:37.191 --> 38:40.736
THAT LITTLE
WHITE POWDER!

38:40.903 --> 38:44.115
SON...

38:44.281 --> 38:46.909
YOU HAD THE COURAGE
TO WIN THIS.

38:47.076 --> 38:50.037
NOW, IF YOU'LL STAY HERE,
THEN I'LL HELP YOU.

38:54.959 --> 38:56.794
UH,

38:56.961 --> 38:59.630
I DIDN'T EARN
THIS MEDAL, MA.

39:02.883 --> 39:05.302
I'M NO HERO,
AND I NEVER WAS.

39:07.513 --> 39:11.976
I WAS JUST THE
ONLY ONE LEFT ALIVE.

39:12.143 --> 39:15.229
THAT WAS GOD'S CHOOSING.

39:15.396 --> 39:16.814
NOW IT'S
GOD'S CHOOSING?

39:19.984 --> 39:22.653
MAMA...

39:22.820 --> 39:25.072
I'M ALIVE
BECAUSE I RAN!

39:28.117 --> 39:30.036
WHEN THE CANNONS
STARTED THAT DAY,

39:30.202 --> 39:34.081
I JUST--
I RAN AND RAN,

39:34.248 --> 39:37.293
AND THEN I--THEN I--l HID
TILL IT WAS ALL OVER.

39:42.548 --> 39:44.550
C-COWARD.

39:44.717 --> 39:47.720
COWARDICE, MA.

39:47.887 --> 39:49.346
THAT'S PUNISHABLE
BY DEATH.

39:49.513 --> 39:53.517
NO. THERE'S NO MEDALS
IN IT, NO BUGLES.

39:53.684 --> 39:58.189
GRANVILLE, EVERYONE
IS AFRAID SOMETIME.

40:01.400 --> 40:06.363
ROY COLLINS
WASN'T AFRAID.

40:06.530 --> 40:09.867
HE TRIED TO STOP ME.

40:10.034 --> 40:12.036
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND,

40:12.203 --> 40:13.579
AND I RAN OUT ON HIM.

40:16.791 --> 40:19.085
AND WHEN I CAME BACK,
HE WAS JUST--HE WAS JUST

40:19.251 --> 40:21.629
LYING THERE
AND LOOKING AT ME.

40:23.714 --> 40:25.925
AND I COULD FEEL
THE DEATH ON HIS HAND.

40:30.554 --> 40:32.181
AND THEN--AND THEN--
AND THEN

40:32.348 --> 40:33.808
WHEN I SAW HIS SON...

40:39.730 --> 40:43.234
THE ONLY WAY TO STOP
RUNNING FROM A SHAME

40:43.400 --> 40:45.569
IS TO FACE IT.

40:45.736 --> 40:49.448
NOW, THERE'S NO SHAME
IN TRUTH.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.992
WE ALL GET SCARED
IN THIS LIFE.

40:55.371 --> 40:58.582
OH, I LOVE YOU.

40:58.749 --> 41:00.584
I NEED YOU.

41:00.751 --> 41:04.004
AND I WANT MY SON
WHOLE AGAIN.

41:13.264 --> 41:14.431
I GOT TO TELL HIM.

41:18.269 --> 41:23.607
MA, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I GOTTA TELL HIM.

41:23.774 --> 41:26.861
ROY'S SON HAS--HAS TO KNOW.

41:27.027 --> 41:30.447
THEN I WON'T EVER
HAVE TO HIDE ANYMORE.

41:32.741 --> 41:33.784
HE LOOKS JUST LIKE HIS PA.

41:33.951 --> 41:36.120
LT'D BE LIKE I WAS
TELLING ROY.

41:36.287 --> 41:37.413
L--l GOTTA DO IT NOW.

41:37.580 --> 41:39.623
LET ME GO WITH YOU.
NO, MA.

41:39.790 --> 41:41.709
NO, IT'S GOTTA BE
JUST LIKE THAT--

41:41.876 --> 41:43.544
THAT DAY.

41:43.711 --> 41:47.631
ALONE.
ALL ALONE.

41:47.798 --> 41:50.467

41:53.596 --> 41:54.722

MORNING, CHARLES.

42:32.927 --> 42:34.678
CHARLES!
YEAH.

42:34.845 --> 42:36.096
WILL YOU
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS?

42:41.393 --> 42:42.394
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

42:42.561 --> 42:44.480
SOMEONE BROKE INTO
MY OFFICE LAST NIGHT.

42:44.647 --> 42:45.731
WHAT?

42:53.614 --> 42:55.866
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TOO MUCH
TROUBLE FIXING THIS LOCK.

43:00.246 --> 43:01.956
HMM! MORPHINE.

43:05.584 --> 43:08.921
YOU KNOW MRS. WHIPPLE AND HER
SON FAIRLY WELL, DON'T YOU?

43:09.088 --> 43:10.881
SURE. GRANVILLE?

43:11.048 --> 43:13.550
YEAH. I'D APPRECIATE IT IF
YOU'D GO OVER THERE WITH ME.

43:16.053 --> 43:17.304
SHE MAY NEED SOMEONE.

43:22.393 --> 43:24.561
I KNOW WHAT HE DID
WAS A TERRIBLE THING,

43:24.728 --> 43:26.855
BUT EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT NOW.

43:27.022 --> 43:30.192
AND HE'LL PAY THE DAMAGES,
DR. BAKER.

43:30.359 --> 43:32.903
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE DAMAGES, MRS.
WHIPPLE.

43:33.070 --> 43:34.905
IT'S GRANVILLE
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT.

43:35.072 --> 43:36.740
YOU SAID HE RODE OUT
TO THE COLLINS' PLACE.

43:36.907 --> 43:39.368
YES, EARLY
THIS MORNING.

43:39.535 --> 43:41.412
THAT TRIP SHOULDN'T TAKE
MORE THAN AN HOUR BOTH WAYS.

43:41.578 --> 43:45.541
WELL, AND I'VE BEEN EXPECTING HIM
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS.

43:45.708 --> 43:47.293
I THINK I OUGHT
TO TAKE A RIDE OUT THERE.

43:47.459 --> 43:50.254
IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE
TO GO WITH YOU, MR. INGALLS.

43:50.421 --> 43:52.131
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

43:52.298 --> 43:53.924
I'LL BE AT THE OFFICE
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

43:54.091 --> 43:55.175

GRANVILLE'S HORSE.
