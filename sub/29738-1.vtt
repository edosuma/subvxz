Hey, if you play this song,

00:32.540 --> 00:35.083
I guarantee motherfuckers'll
start hopping and squirming.

00:35.166 --> 00:38.416
When I used to play this record live,
motherfuckers would actually faint.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.700
They would faint on the floor.

00:39.750 --> 00:42.430
I'd have to call the amba-lance
and pick all these motherfuckers up.

00:42.458 --> 00:45.101
Every time I played this.
They start callin' the hospital in advance

00:45.125 --> 00:47.125
and tell them,
"Rudy gonna be singing tonight.

00:47.208 --> 00:50.328

carrying motherfuckers out the club."

00:52.208 --> 00:53.625
"Buggy Ride"?

00:53.708 --> 00:55.750
Hey, that ain't no small-time shit, man.

00:56.666 --> 01:00.333
Goddamn, Rudy. I got Marvin Gaye
singing "Let's Get It On."

01:00.416 --> 01:02.875
I can't be playin' no "Buggy Ride."

01:02.958 --> 01:05.916
- I got 60 seconds to get to the next tune.
- Okay, man, how about this?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.541
This a nice R&B single.

01:07.625 --> 01:09.875
It's a catchy thing
called "Step It Up and Go."

01:09.958 --> 01:11.583
Heh. Come on, are you for real?

01:11.666 --> 01:14.000
Hey, man,
that shit right there was monumental.

01:14.083 --> 01:16.166
That's my number one selling single.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.930
Put the shit in rotation,

01:18.000 --> 01:21.500

01:22.375 --> 01:24.583

01:24.666 --> 01:26.916
Okay, man.

01:59.166 --> 02:02.166

Promote the shit out of the thang,

02:02.250 --> 02:04.125

that fucking James Brown.

02:04.208 --> 02:07.250
He come out jumping around,
doing splits and shit

02:07.333 --> 02:10.250

and sucked up all the attention.

02:10.333 --> 02:15.541
Say, man, do you think I wanna work at
a ghetto record store as a DJ?

02:15.625 --> 02:17.583
Sometimes our dreams

02:17.666 --> 02:19.000

02:21.625 --> 02:24.291

so I stretched it out a little bit.

06:09.166 --> 06:10.750

06:23.708 --> 06:26.333
Know what I mean? 'Cause
I'm a total entertainment experience.

06:26.416 --> 06:28.333
I sing, I do comedy, and I dance,

06:28.416 --> 06:30.625
and I do a dance called <i>adagio</i> dancing

- Rudy, that's 1950.

That's some funny shit.

07:24.541 --> 07:27.125
He ain't that funny.
He just cussing up a storm.

07:27.791 --> 07:29.208
He ain't cussing.

07:29.291 --> 07:32.333
It's clever. I don't know. See...

07:33.250 --> 07:37.208
My Dick ain't his dick.
My Dick is actually his horse.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.416
I know what My Dick is.
I ain't a fucking imbecile.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.958
He's just using a double entendre
so the police don't come get his ass.

07:43.041 --> 07:45.083
You know, I used to work with Redd Foxx.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.458
- You knew Redd Foxx?
- Oh, yeah.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.666
We was in the kitchen
washing dishes together,

07:51.750 --> 07:53.625
but I worked with the motherfucker.

07:53.708 --> 07:57.125
One day, he went up in front of
the right promoter, got his big break.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.375
Oh, here go that fucking Ricco.

08:01.625 --> 08:05.083
Ah, man, he smells like urine.
He be touching the door.

08:05.166 --> 08:07.791
- Man, go stop him.
- I'm not stopping shit, man.

08:07.875 --> 08:09.750
I'm assistant manager.
I'm delegating to you.

08:09.833 --> 08:11.291
You deal with stinking-ass Ricco.

08:11.375 --> 08:14.041
I'm not going
anywhere near them germs, man.

08:14.125 --> 08:17.916
Ricco responds best to authority,
so the manager should do it.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.750
Oh, shit, man.

08:21.833 --> 08:23.416
Hell, no, Ricco. Not today.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.125
I was born in a barrel of butcher knives.

08:26.208 --> 08:28.750
Been shot in the ass by two Colt .45s.

08:28.833 --> 08:29.750

08:29.833 --> 08:33.582

08:33.666 --> 08:37.166

08:37.250 --> 08:38.875
All right, nigga, let's go. That's it.

08:38.957 --> 08:41.707
Jumped in the ocean
and swallowed a whale.

08:41.791 --> 08:45.708
Handcuffed lightning,
throwed thunder's ass in jail.

08:45.791 --> 08:48.375
Look, Ricco, this ain't no place
for your hobo stories.

08:48.458 --> 08:50.250
Whoa, I ain't no hobo.

08:50.333 --> 08:53.750
I am a repository
of Afro-American folklore.

08:54.625 --> 08:57.916
Come on. Lookit, brother. I just need
some money to get something to eat.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.375
I ain't got no teeth.
All I can do is sip on some soup.

09:00.458 --> 09:01.833
Come on, give me a quarter.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.375
Ricco, I'm gonna give you a quarter.
You go get you some soup.

09:05.458 --> 09:08.041
Then you just got to get up out of here.
Let's go, man.

09:08.125 --> 09:11.166
- Get my black ass on.
- Go on now. All right, okay.

09:11.250 --> 09:14.500
First, I'm gonna tell you one of the
funniest fuckin' things you ever did hear.

09:14.583 --> 09:17.625
- Oh, come on, man.
- Some people think that Willie Green...

09:17.708 --> 09:19.916
was the baddest man
the world had ever seen.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
But I want you to light up a joint,
screw your wig on tight,

09:24.083 --> 09:27.416
and let me tell you about
a little bad motherfucker

09:27.500 --> 09:29.000
called Dolemite.

09:33.083 --> 09:35.083
Man, I haven't heard those
in a long time.

09:35.166 --> 09:38.250
- Dolemite, Signifying Monkey.
- He did all of them ones.

09:38.333 --> 09:40.666
'Cause I had a uncle that was in jail,

09:40.750 --> 09:43.208
and they was doing that shit
all the time, telling jokes,

09:43.291 --> 09:45.208
'cause they had nothing else to do.

09:45.791 --> 09:47.041
You could fuck.

09:47.125 --> 09:49.958
Yes, Toney, you could fuck,
but we ain't talking about that right now.

09:50.041 --> 09:51.708
Hey, you know what I was thinking, man.

09:52.666 --> 09:56.041
What y'all think would happen
if somebody took those jokes...

09:56.916 --> 10:00.708
a professional, and polished them,
and turn it into a act?

10:00.791 --> 10:03.291
Yeah, and did it on a stoop.

10:03.375 --> 10:05.541
- In a barbershop?
- Yeah, in a barbershop.

10:05.625 --> 10:08.708
- Rudy, that's a good idea.
- Yeah, man, that shit could work.

10:08.791 --> 10:12.041
Say, Rudy man, all them slave jokes,
that shit not gonna work.

10:12.125 --> 10:14.041
I wouldn't put it in my act, personally.

10:14.125 --> 10:16.684
- Hey, man, funny is funny.
<i>- </i> They're not ready for the big time.

10:16.708 --> 10:19.416

10:27.500 --> 10:31.708
Before I go out, I always keep
"The Morning After" in my hip pocket,

10:31.791 --> 10:34.958
- just in case there's any white faces.
- What the hell is "The Morning After"?

10:35.041 --> 10:38.208

We was just havin' a little fun.

11:29.375 --> 11:32.666
Hey, man, how'd my life get so damn small?

11:34.291 --> 11:36.625
I came out here
with some big plans, Jimmy.

11:36.708 --> 11:39.625
I was gonna do it all,
just like Sammy Davis Jr.

11:39.708 --> 11:42.166
Movies, concerts, TV. Everything.

11:43.083 --> 11:46.416
This job at Dolphin's supposed to be
my temporary day job.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.000
Cut to a million years later,
it's all I got.

11:51.041 --> 11:55.083
- You still got the Californian Club.
- Oh, man. That ain't gonna lead to shit.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.375
I ain't got nothing nobody want.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.875
- Man, he got somethin'.
- Yeah.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.583
Man, who the... Who is this?

12:11.416 --> 12:13.125
I don't know, man. You ever seen him?

12:13.208 --> 12:15.017
- No, I ain't never seen any...
- Hey, brothers.

12:15.041 --> 12:17.583
How y'all doing tonight?
I'm trying to find Ricco.

12:17.666 --> 12:19.916
Ricco? Who in the fuck is that?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.708
That's a old bum with no teeth.

12:21.791 --> 12:23.791
You mean like this?

12:23.875 --> 12:26.583
Oh, shit. Guess that
ain't narrow it down at all, did it?

12:26.666 --> 12:28.250
It ain't like it used to be.

12:28.333 --> 12:32.208
This neighborhood been went to shit, man.
It's sad, sad, sad.

12:32.291 --> 12:36.666
You see this building over here?
That's the Dunbar Hotel.

12:36.750 --> 12:40.666
That used to be the center
of black arts entertainment.

12:40.750 --> 12:43.708
I saw Duke Ellington there,
Billie Holiday,

12:43.791 --> 12:48.083
but now it's just filled with
a bunch of junkies and winos.

12:48.166 --> 12:51.166
- Junkies and winos.
- Tony, I'm gonna pay your money. Shit.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.958
Oh, shit. There he go right there.

12:53.041 --> 12:55.625
- Ricco. Hey, man.
- That what you been talking about?

12:55.708 --> 12:57.583
Hey, brother! How you doing, Ricco?

12:57.666 --> 12:59.500
- What's going on, man?
- I don't know you.

12:59.583 --> 13:02.125
Yeah, man. I'm your friend
from Dolphin's Records.

13:03.875 --> 13:05.916
Ain't you the son of a bitch
that throws me out?

13:06.000 --> 13:08.208
Oh, no, Ricco. That's that other guy, man.

13:08.291 --> 13:11.208
Hey, man, look. Look here, man.
I got some money, and I got some hooch.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.458
How you like to sit down
and tell me your stories?

13:13.541 --> 13:16.625
Cocaine Shorty's my name.
Fuckin' is my claim.

13:16.708 --> 13:21.291
You can line 98 hos up against a wall,
I bet you a dollar I can fuck 'em all.

13:21.375 --> 13:24.291
- I can top that.
- Oh, no, you can't top that.

13:24.375 --> 13:25.583
Hey, neither can he.

13:25.666 --> 13:29.208
- I'm the funniest motherfucker out here.
- Hey, don't need to argue, fellas.

13:29.291 --> 13:31.166
Hold on now. I got some more money.

13:31.250 --> 13:34.166
I wanna hear
from all the liquor store wise men.

13:34.250 --> 13:35.750
Okay, let's go now. What's next?

13:36.458 --> 13:39.125
<i>I fucked an elephant and her mother.</i>

13:39.208 --> 13:42.208
I fucked the bull, the cow,
and her brother.

13:44.333 --> 13:46.333
I need a better punchline.

13:46.416 --> 13:49.541
Fucked a... cow... bull, a cow.

13:50.833 --> 13:54.375
Fucked a elephant.
Dared her to mutter.

13:56.291 --> 14:00.791
I could look up a bull's ass
and tell you the price of butter.

14:02.666 --> 14:03.875
That is funny.

14:04.916 --> 14:08.166
Fucked an elephant down to a coon.

14:08.250 --> 14:12.750
Even fucked the same...
Yes, I fucked an elephant down to a coon.

14:15.291 --> 14:17.750
I fucked a elephant down to a coon!

14:19.375 --> 14:22.916
Yes, I fucked a elephant down to a coon.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Even fucked the same cow
that jumped over the motherfucking moon.

14:28.333 --> 14:31.000
<i>I got kicked out of South America
for fucking steers.</i>

14:31.083 --> 14:34.541
I fucked a she elephant
till she broke down in tears.

14:37.125 --> 14:40.250
I got thrown out of South America
for fucking steers.

14:42.583 --> 14:45.666
I fucked King Kong's mama
till she broke down in tears.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.708
Dole-Dolemite is my...

14:52.791 --> 14:54.791
Dolemite is my name.

14:57.625 --> 14:59.750
Way down in the jungle deep,

14:59.833 --> 15:01.500
lion stepped on the s...

15:02.625 --> 15:04.666
Way down in the jungle deep...

15:06.666 --> 15:09.875
a lion stepped on
a signified monkey's feet!

15:11.333 --> 15:15.958
Dolemite is my name,
and fucking up motherfuckers is my game!

15:28.833 --> 15:31.000
All right.

15:31.083 --> 15:34.208
How it is that he can take you
beautiful people with him?

15:35.416 --> 15:37.333
That's my kinfolk. Come on now.

15:37.416 --> 15:39.708
Stay right here. Yes, sir.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.755
The fuck is you in tux? What'd you do
to your hair? You look like a pimp.

15:45.833 --> 15:48.208
I come up with a new character
and all new material, too.

15:48.291 --> 15:50.291
Well, actually, it's old material.

15:50.375 --> 15:51.708
I don't need this.

15:54.041 --> 15:55.916
Just stick to your regular set.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.166
It's always somethin'.

16:27.208 --> 16:29.708
Way down in the jungle deep...

16:31.708 --> 16:34.750
the lion stepped on
the signified monkey's feet.

16:36.375 --> 16:39.541
The monkey said,
"Motherfucker, can't you see...

16:40.291 --> 16:43.000
you standing on my goddamn feet?"

16:44.583 --> 16:47.125
The lion said,
"I ain't heard a word you said.

16:48.166 --> 16:51.541
If you say three more, I'll jump off
on your motherfucking head."

16:54.125 --> 16:55.958
Man, don't give me
that Buddy Hackett shit.

16:56.041 --> 16:58.208
Make that shit swing.
Put your weight on it.

16:59.875 --> 17:03.041
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

17:10.083 --> 17:13.125
But the monkey got wise
and started using his wit.

17:15.540 --> 17:18.665
Said, "I think I'm gonna bring an end
to all this ass-kicking shit."

17:24.040 --> 17:26.665
He ran up on the lion the very next day.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.416
He said, "Oh, Mr. Lion,

17:29.500 --> 17:32.833
there's a big, bad, burly motherfucker
coming your way."

17:34.500 --> 17:37.166
He said, "And he's somebody
that you don't know...

17:38.208 --> 17:40.750
'cause he just broke-a loose
from Ringling Brothers' show."

17:44.125 --> 17:46.583
Said, "He talked about your people
in a hell of a way.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.166
Yes, he talked about your people
till my hair turned gray."

17:59.208 --> 18:01.875
He said, "Your daddy's a freak,
and your mama's a whore."

18:04.625 --> 18:08.416
Said, "He spotted you in the jungle
sellin' your black ass from door to door."

18:15.125 --> 18:18.041
He said, "Your sister got down
and did a hell of a trick.

18:21.666 --> 18:24.000
She got so low,
she sucked a earthworm's dick."

18:30.750 --> 18:35.750
He said he corn-holed your uncle,
fucked your auntie and your niece,

18:35.833 --> 18:39.708
and the next time he see your grandma,
he gonna get him another good piece.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.625
I ain't lying!

19:02.166 --> 19:03.958
Smells good.

19:04.041 --> 19:06.166
- Just like back home, right?
- Yes, Lord.

19:06.250 --> 19:08.875
Say, when's the last time
you been back to Arkansas?

19:08.958 --> 19:12.750
Oh, a long time. I ain't got
a lot of good memories from back home,

19:12.833 --> 19:15.208
so I don't be thinking about
back home much.

19:15.291 --> 19:18.958
Basically, when I think about back home,
I think, "Fuck back home."

19:19.041 --> 19:20.291
Hey, you know, Auntie?

19:20.375 --> 19:21.375
Mm-hmm?

19:21.458 --> 19:24.708
You know, I was thinking about
maybe putting out another record.

19:25.500 --> 19:29.125
Another record? Why don't you help me
get rid of some of that shit

19:29.208 --> 19:32.708
that's stacked up over there
in the corner? "Another record."

19:32.791 --> 19:34.875
This time, I'm gonna put out
a comedy record.

19:35.791 --> 19:40.291
Comedy? You've been a singer,
you've been a shake dancer,

19:40.375 --> 19:43.250
and one time, I think
you even called yourself a fortune teller.

19:43.333 --> 19:46.750
You know it's real hard to break in.
I'd do whatever it takes to get in.

19:46.833 --> 19:49.791
Is it gonna be like that
cute lil' Bill Cosby?

19:49.875 --> 19:51.833
He's so sweet.

19:51.916 --> 19:57.750
He tells those family tales
about the kids playing in the street,

19:57.833 --> 19:59.791
playing jacks and such. I like that.

19:59.875 --> 20:01.958
Yeah, there's gonna be stories
about family and kids

20:02.041 --> 20:04.291
- and a grandma and grandpa.
- Oh, that's nice.

20:04.375 --> 20:07.750
So, yeah, it's gonna be stories,
but listen. Here's what the thing is.

20:07.833 --> 20:11.708
- I'm trying to be entrepreneurial on this.
- Oh, let us bow our heads and pray.

20:11.791 --> 20:15.041
Father God, I wanna thank you
for giving me the strength

20:15.125 --> 20:17.250
to make this meal for my beloved family.

20:17.333 --> 20:21.416
Let us nourish our body
in Jesus' name. Amen.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.916
- Thank you, Lord.
- All right, then.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.375
Thank you for this pork chop.
Now, as I was saying...

20:26.458 --> 20:28.578
- You want some hot sauce?
- Come on now, Auntie, now.

20:28.625 --> 20:32.166
I wanna be entrepreneurial on this thing,
and I need you to loan me some money

20:32.250 --> 20:34.375
- so I can get some recording equipment.
- No, no.

20:34.458 --> 20:36.708
- Mm-mmm.
- Come on, Auntie. You rich, woman.

20:36.791 --> 20:38.625
I'm not rich.
What make you think I'm rich?

20:38.708 --> 20:41.416
What happened to all that money you made
when you fell off that bus?

20:41.500 --> 20:44.833
Uh, that is my money
to do with what I want to,

20:44.916 --> 20:46.833
and I only got $250.

20:46.916 --> 20:49.958
That's exactly how much I need
to be a star.

20:50.041 --> 20:53.500
- Come on, woman. Loan me...
- I got my coat on layaway...

20:53.583 --> 20:56.250
- Please...
- I'm already into 'em for $50...

20:56.333 --> 20:57.666
She gonna give me the money.

20:57.750 --> 21:01.083
'Cause you about to cut off my air supply.
Get up from around my neck.

21:01.166 --> 21:04.041
- Why you so fucking stingy, then?
- Ain't this a bitch?

21:04.125 --> 21:05.750
Give me the money, woman.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.625
Why the hell is there a line?
You told me we were going to a party.

21:11.708 --> 21:14.916
We are going to a party.
We're making a party record.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.333
Come on in. Come on in. Watch your step.

21:17.416 --> 21:19.166
- Watch your step.
- Gimme some skin, baby.

21:19.250 --> 21:21.041
Come on in. Watch your step.

21:23.958 --> 21:26.958
Fedco gin?
I didn't even know they made alcohol.

21:27.041 --> 21:29.000
Nigga, we ain't going for flavor.

21:29.083 --> 21:32.166
Look, I don't see how this can work.
We should be in a real club.

21:32.250 --> 21:35.041
I don't wanna hear that shit.
We got what we got. Gotta make it work.

21:35.125 --> 21:37.291
- You're my producer, right?
- I am?

21:37.375 --> 21:39.750
What do you think we're doing here?
We producing an album.

21:39.833 --> 21:42.083
- Okay.
- Okay, all right? Come here, man.

21:42.166 --> 21:43.166
Okay.

21:44.750 --> 21:47.000
Hey, man,
get these people limber and loose.

21:47.083 --> 21:49.125
Right, right, right, right.

21:49.625 --> 21:50.708
Producer.

21:51.625 --> 21:53.250
Oh, guess I'm producing.

21:59.291 --> 22:02.750
All right, y'all know what it is.
Y'all know what time it is.

22:02.833 --> 22:04.666
It's show time, y'all. Come on now.

22:06.291 --> 22:08.000
Give yourself a round of applause.

22:08.916 --> 22:11.208
Okay, I want everybody
to have a good time tonight.

22:11.291 --> 22:14.750
We doing a album this evening,
a live recording.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.375
We got a engineer back there.
He's professional.

22:17.458 --> 22:21.375
That nigga done been on <i>Leave It to Beaver</i>
and <i>Gunsmoke.</i> All kinds of shit.

22:22.333 --> 22:25.791
Okay. Yeah, all right, y'all.
The time we've been waiting for.

22:25.875 --> 22:28.791
The man of the hour. The man, the myth.

22:28.875 --> 22:30.583
You love him, and I love him.

22:30.666 --> 22:35.166
Put your hands together
for Rudy Ray Moore.

22:54.583 --> 22:55.916
All right now.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.125
Some folks say Willie Green...

23:03.666 --> 23:07.083
was the baddest motherfucker
that the world had ever seen.

23:08.708 --> 23:11.208
I want you to light you up a joint,
take a real good shit,

23:11.291 --> 23:12.541
and screw your wig on tight.

23:14.708 --> 23:18.041
And let me tell you about that
bad motherfucker called Dolemite.

23:18.125 --> 23:19.708
Dolemite. Come on, Rudy.

23:20.541 --> 23:22.958
<i>Now, Dolemite was born in San Antone.</i>

23:24.125 --> 23:26.666
<i>A rambling, gambling,
scrambling motherfucker</i>

23:26.750 --> 23:28.041
<i>since the day he was born.</i>

23:29.166 --> 23:32.500
<i>On the day he was dropped
from his mammy's ass...</i>

23:33.166 --> 23:35.458
<i>he slapped his pappy in the face,
and said,</i>

23:35.541 --> 23:38.083
<i>"From now on, cocksucker,
I'm running this place."</i>

23:38.750 --> 23:42.041
<i>- At the age of one...</i>
- Okay, I've heard enough.

23:42.125 --> 23:46.375
- Hey, but you haven't even got to the...
- It's filthy. And I know filthy.

23:46.458 --> 23:49.250
Jesus, you can't play that over the radio.

23:49.333 --> 23:52.416
And you can't sell it over the counter
in most cities.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.666
Record stores, they don't wanna be raided.

23:54.750 --> 23:57.625
Raided? Hey, come on, man.
The world has changed.

23:57.708 --> 24:01.458
<i>Deep Throat</i> is a big-ass hit movie,
and the lady sucks a cock in every scene.

24:01.541 --> 24:04.416
Yeah, in porno houses.

24:04.500 --> 24:07.208
Record stores, they're a family business.

24:07.291 --> 24:08.541
Kids go in.

24:08.625 --> 24:13.416
Uh, look, on vinyl,
you can call a guy a cocksucker,

24:13.500 --> 24:15.875
but you can't say he sucks a cock.

24:17.250 --> 24:19.958
- Can you grasp the distinction?
- No, I do not.

24:20.041 --> 24:23.041
If I want to say
that a woman's pussy is so hot,

24:23.125 --> 24:26.583
it makes a motherfucker's asshole burn,
then I'm gonna say it!

24:28.500 --> 24:29.625
Then say it.

24:30.583 --> 24:35.416
But you've got a product here
that you can't sell or promote.

24:39.375 --> 24:41.208
What'd he say?

24:41.291 --> 24:45.250
Shit, man, we just got into some legal
semantic argument about cocksucking.

24:49.416 --> 24:53.416
You know what, man? Fuck him.
We gonna put this shit out ourself.

24:54.833 --> 24:55.833
Come on.

25:11.833 --> 25:16.291
- Say, Rudy. What's with the devil faces?
- I want it to look illegal.

25:16.375 --> 25:19.000
Real naughty. Like some shit
they ain't supposed to have.

25:24.791 --> 25:28.791
<i>Yes, I rode across the ocean
on the head of my dick.</i>

25:28.875 --> 25:32.166
<i>Ate nine tons of cat shit
and ain't never got sick.</i>

25:34.041 --> 25:35.041
Rudy.

25:35.166 --> 25:37.500
<i>I fucked bitches and paid my rent.</i>

25:38.375 --> 25:41.791
<i>I don't owe a living ass
a motherfucking cent.</i>

25:45.833 --> 25:48.625
<i>So, motherfuckers, can't you see?</i>

25:48.708 --> 25:51.458
<i>I pity the son of a bitch
that fucks with me.</i>

25:55.125 --> 25:58.541
<i>I can walk the desert sand
and never leave a track.</i>

25:58.625 --> 26:00.375
<i>Fuck the hump out of a camel's back.</i>

26:00.458 --> 26:04.958
Hey, man. All right, wait for a second.
Wanna buy one of these ashtrays, nigga?

26:05.041 --> 26:06.916
<i>Welcome back
to the Californian Club</i>

26:07.000 --> 26:09.916
<i>Mr. Dolemite himself... Rudy Ray Moore.</i>

26:10.000 --> 26:13.250
Yes, I want you to listen and listen well.

26:13.333 --> 26:16.583
'Cause I'm that bad motherfucker
that drove the devil out of hell.

26:17.750 --> 26:21.958
I once walked from New York City
to the deep, deep South

26:22.041 --> 26:25.000
just to slap a son of a bitch
in his motherfucking mouth.

26:30.291 --> 26:31.541
All right.

26:31.625 --> 26:35.083
Mules have kicked me,
and they didn't bruise my hide.

26:36.333 --> 26:39.166
<i>A rattlesnake bit me
and then just crawled off and died.</i>

26:40.708 --> 26:45.291
<i>'Cause Dolemite is my name,
and fucking up motherfuckers is my game.</i>

26:50.166 --> 26:52.966
<i>He said, "Your daddy's
a freak, and your mama's a whore."</i>

26:55.375 --> 26:59.333
<i>Said he spotted you in the jungle
selling your black ass from door-to-door.</i>

26:59.416 --> 27:00.791
Quiet. Listen.

27:00.875 --> 27:03.500
<i>Said your sister got down
and did a hell of a trick.</i>

27:04.291 --> 27:07.083
<i>She got so low
she sucked a earthworm's dick.</i>

27:07.166 --> 27:09.875
- What the hell is this?
- Every black hipster is listening to it.

27:09.958 --> 27:12.583
You go down Crenshaw,
South Central, Baldwin Hills...

27:12.666 --> 27:14.500
this is blasting out of every door.

27:15.166 --> 27:16.166
It's insane.

27:16.250 --> 27:18.583
The guy is actually selling it
out of his car trunk.

27:20.041 --> 27:21.958
And you think this can cross over?

27:22.791 --> 27:25.250
To who? Whites?

27:25.333 --> 27:27.958
No. To blacks
who don't shop out of car trunks.

27:30.291 --> 27:32.708
I just want to say
to all you Bihari brothers

27:32.791 --> 27:34.166
that I am ecstatic.

27:34.250 --> 27:35.666
Anything y'all want me to do, man.

27:35.750 --> 27:38.958
Whatever it takes to make this record
go up the charts, I'm ready to do it.

27:39.041 --> 27:40.625
Okay, Rudy. We're glad to hear that.

27:40.708 --> 27:42.916
If y'all need me on the Chitlin Circuit,
I can do that.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.142
I know all the clubs.
I could hit the radio stations...

27:45.166 --> 27:46.333
Right, right.

27:46.416 --> 27:49.000
We have a crack marketing promotion team.
We'll figure this out.

27:49.083 --> 27:51.500
All my life, I've been wanting
to be famous, you know?

27:51.583 --> 27:54.375
But this is more than that.
This is about connecting with the people.

27:54.458 --> 27:55.791
You know, this is my moment.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.958
So anyway, the name of the album
is "Eat Out More Often," right?

27:59.041 --> 28:01.121
So I'm thinking we got the girl
lying on the day bed,

28:01.166 --> 28:03.666
you're sneaking up on her,
you're peering over spread legs.

28:03.750 --> 28:04.666
See what I'm saying?

28:04.750 --> 28:06.916
Lemme show you
what me and Crystal worked out.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.125
Crystal, honey,
show 'em what we worked out.

28:11.875 --> 28:14.875
I'm like Muhammad Ali.
We getting ready to shock the worlds.

28:14.958 --> 28:16.875
I got to be totally outrageous.

28:16.958 --> 28:18.541
That's what I'm talking about.

28:18.625 --> 28:21.666
Hey, give me that. Crystal,
lay out here for a second for me, honey.

28:21.750 --> 28:24.267
- How do you want me?
- Just lay out on the thing here.

28:24.291 --> 28:27.541
Uh, yeah, I like that.
Put that over just a little bit.

28:27.625 --> 28:31.625
Just... Gimme... You know, gimme somethin'.
Yeah. And hold on to this.

28:32.583 --> 28:33.875
Oh, shit now.

28:34.708 --> 28:36.083
Yeah, something like this.

28:51.208 --> 28:53.958
<i>Yes, it sure is good
to be here in Mississippi.</i>

28:55.833 --> 28:58.250
<i>The only place
where the ducks fly upside down,</i>

28:58.333 --> 29:00.208
<i>'cause it ain't nothing worth shitting on.</i>

29:00.833 --> 29:03.916
<i>I used to know a fella from Mississippi.
He was so dumb.</i>

29:04.000 --> 29:07.750
<i>This motherfucker was so dumb,
he thought manual labor was a Mexican.</i>

29:08.708 --> 29:12.625
He was so dumb, he thought
that Kotex was mattress for mice.

29:14.208 --> 29:17.458
This motherfucker was so dumb,
he turned down a blow job

29:17.541 --> 29:20.541
'cause he thought they'd stop giving him
his unemployment check.

29:21.625 --> 29:24.458
I ain't lying.
This was a dumb motherfucker.

29:26.083 --> 29:28.123
I'm sitting here
with Mr. Rudy Ray Moore,

29:28.166 --> 29:31.458
who will be appearing here
in Macon, Georgia, this Saturday night.

29:31.541 --> 29:33.166
Yes, at Jasper's on Fifth Street.

Woman, you better close your legs
'fore I eat off your drawers.

29:52.416 --> 29:55.496
The other day, I was with a young lady.
I said to her, "Do you have a cherry?"

29:55.541 --> 29:57.625
<i>She said,
"Rudy, of course I have a cherry.</i>

29:57.708 --> 30:01.833

this microphone smell like ass.

31:50.041 --> 31:51.041
Yeah.

32:01.791 --> 32:04.333
Hey, bartender, how about a drink
for the pretty girl?

32:05.833 --> 32:07.583
Come on now. I know what the hell I am.

32:07.666 --> 32:10.708
I ain't pretty, and I sure as hell
ain't no goddamn girl.

32:14.791 --> 32:16.208
I'll have a daiquiri.

32:16.291 --> 32:19.750
Your ass should be headlining here
tomorrow with that right hand you got.

32:19.833 --> 32:21.708
- That was a hell of a fight.
- Fight? Shit.

32:21.791 --> 32:24.291
You know, she can go on ahead
and have his sorry ass

32:24.375 --> 32:26.291
and his dangling ball sack.

32:26.375 --> 32:29.500
Fucking breath smell like
mildewed goddamn garlic.

32:33.250 --> 32:36.666
He shouldn't be spending that paycheck
for all his run-around hussies

32:36.750 --> 32:40.500
when we got our son out here
with holes in his britches and shoes.

32:42.208 --> 32:43.333
How about that?

32:51.875 --> 32:52.875
I'm Rudy.

32:57.291 --> 32:59.625

- Lady Reed.

32:59.708 --> 33:01.416
You ever been up onstage, Lady Reed?

33:01.500 --> 33:03.083
Nah, I ain't show folk.

33:03.166 --> 33:05.583
Oh, shit. Yeah, you are. I could tell.

33:05.666 --> 33:08.750
Some people walk around
with their own little personal spotlight.

33:08.833 --> 33:11.875
I noticed that in you right 'fore
you knocked that nigga on his ass.

33:14.041 --> 33:16.208
I used to be a backup singer
in New Orleans.

33:16.291 --> 33:17.458
I knew it. I told you.

33:18.375 --> 33:20.166
- You sure do.
- Singer, huh?

33:20.250 --> 33:21.458
I'd get so nervous,

33:21.541 --> 33:24.166
I had to hang on to the mic
from not falling over.

33:24.250 --> 33:28.375
Butterflies all in my stomach.
Once, I even shit on the goddamn stage.

33:28.458 --> 33:29.916
Yeah.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.625
You're funny.
You should be doing stand-up.

33:32.708 --> 33:33.958
Nigga, you trying to hit on me?

33:34.041 --> 33:36.875
Because I just broke up five minutes ago
on my cheating-ass man.

33:36.958 --> 33:39.625
- I'm really not in the fucking mood.
- No. I'm serious.

33:40.208 --> 33:42.083
Maybe you should be onstage like me.

33:43.083 --> 33:44.541
Sweet Jesus.

33:49.833 --> 33:52.666
I mean, I can make my son laugh.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.291
But what... what would I do?

33:58.333 --> 34:00.083
I'm not really no pimp.

34:00.166 --> 34:02.958
I ain't got no stable of whores.
I just created a character.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.375
I do it all the time.
I been Prince DuMarr.

34:05.458 --> 34:09.291
I been the Harlem Hillbilly.
And tonight, look at this here.

34:11.625 --> 34:13.958
- Tug on my shit.
- Tug on what?

34:14.041 --> 34:16.375
- Tug on my sh... Just tug on me.
- Tug on this?

34:16.458 --> 34:18.916
Mm-hmm. Just give a little tug.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.333
Don't tug too hard.
Don't take the motherfucker off.

34:21.416 --> 34:25.416
- Oh, shit. That's a motherfucking wig.
- That's right.

34:25.500 --> 34:29.416
It's all pretend. Put on a cape
and turn into a fucking superhero.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.541
Leave the real you behind.

I'm gonna have 'em with the boots.

Merry Christmas to all of y'all.

Oh, I know damn sure you is.
Shit, all that money he getting.

Y'all wanna see something?
Lemme treat y'all to a picture show.

38:38.875 --> 38:41.416

- Oh, I wanna see <i>Shaft in Africa.</i>

38:41.500 --> 38:42.820
Hey, how about <i>Front Page?</i>

38:42.875 --> 38:45.625
The newspaper said it was the best,
funniest thing in town.

38:45.708 --> 38:47.791
I feel like laughing. Let's go laugh.

40:02.041 --> 40:04.750
Nobody even got naked.
Was that even a real movie?

40:04.833 --> 40:06.593
I told him
let's go see <i>Blackenstein.</i>

40:06.625 --> 40:09.208
Why do these creaky old people
get to star in movies?

40:09.291 --> 40:11.731
- White folks get all the breaks.
- Say, Rudy.

40:12.541 --> 40:14.666
Since when you ain't saying shit?

40:14.750 --> 40:16.208
I was just thinking, man.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.166
This movie's playing
'cross the whole country.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.666
It ain't got no titties,
no funny, and no kung fu.

40:23.333 --> 40:25.583
I was watching at that light
that come out the projector.

40:25.666 --> 40:27.506
They shine that motherfucker
across the theater

40:27.541 --> 40:30.250
onto a 80-foot-tall screen
and then bam... it's like magic.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.267
Know how many mule miles
I had to drive cross this country

40:33.291 --> 40:34.916
to get my name in people's mouth?

40:35.000 --> 40:36.708
I got to get up on that light.

40:37.375 --> 40:40.625
If I get up in that light,
with my own movie,

40:40.708 --> 40:42.541
I could be everywhere.

40:42.625 --> 40:44.875
I could be everywhere all at once.

40:47.500 --> 40:49.875
I have a gigantic fan base.

40:49.958 --> 40:52.083
Just did a national tour,
just got back from it.

40:52.166 --> 40:56.416
And I had two albums
hit the <i>Billboard </i> charts at the same time.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.500
That's why I feel it's time for me
to make my move to the big screen.

41:00.541 --> 41:04.041
Right. If I could just
shoot straight with you?

41:04.125 --> 41:08.500
When we say gigantic fan base,
aren't we really just talking about

41:08.583 --> 41:11.063
a small group of passionate
brothers and sisters here or there?

41:11.125 --> 41:13.041
I mean, your appeal is limited.

41:13.125 --> 41:15.291
It's not exactly
like you're playing the Apollo.

41:16.375 --> 41:19.541
Now, surely you wouldn't suggest
for American International

41:19.625 --> 41:25.083
to invest the likes of $300,000
to turn this into a major production.

41:25.166 --> 41:27.458
Yeah, but come on, man.
I see all y'all's posters here.

41:27.541 --> 41:28.708
I fit in perfect.

41:28.791 --> 41:30.041
Black folks love me.

41:30.625 --> 41:32.791
Yeah, you see,
that's the thing here, Rudy.

41:32.875 --> 41:35.875
Here, we do
a certain type of black picture.

41:35.958 --> 41:41.166
The actors we hire
are like, uh, Fred Williamson, Jim Brown.

41:41.250 --> 41:46.500
Now, see, you on the other hand,
you're a bit doughier than them, you see?

41:47.250 --> 41:48.250
Doughier?

41:53.041 --> 41:55.458
Well, hey, man, I put on a girdle.
What I got to do?

41:55.541 --> 41:58.375
Come on, brother.
They waiting on Dolemite movie.

41:58.458 --> 42:00.083
Let's bring Dolemite to the screen.

42:00.166 --> 42:02.875
I don't know how much longer
we can do these pictures, Rudy.

42:02.958 --> 42:05.125
You see,
that's why we changing our approach.

42:05.208 --> 42:07.250
We got a new one coming.
I bet you gonna like this.

42:07.333 --> 42:08.958
You really gonna dig this one.

42:09.041 --> 42:14.041
Check this out.
It's called <i>Cornbread, Earl and Me.</i>

42:14.125 --> 42:15.500
It's about a kid from the ghetto

42:15.583 --> 42:18.463
that's the first from the neighborhood
to get out and make it to college.

42:18.500 --> 42:21.333
Now, don't that make you feel good
on the inside, Rudy?

42:23.375 --> 42:27.166
Brother, don't nobody wanna see
no shit like that.

42:28.208 --> 42:31.041
Come on, Rudy.
Be realistic.

42:31.958 --> 42:34.541
You're not a movie star.
You're not an actor.

42:34.625 --> 42:36.500
You're not Billy Dee Williams.

42:36.583 --> 42:39.333
You're a comedy star. Be happy with that.

42:39.416 --> 42:42.625
Man, I want more. All my life,
people been telling me no.

42:42.708 --> 42:45.208
My daddy always told me
I was a piece of shit.

42:45.291 --> 42:48.250
Just another dumb-ass country-poor nigga.

42:48.333 --> 42:50.500
Thought I was gonna be a sharecropper
like he was.

42:50.583 --> 42:53.250
I can't imagine you
plowing fields.

42:54.833 --> 42:56.750
He wasn't my real daddy nohow.

42:56.833 --> 42:58.833
Dirty rotten motherfucker
always beating on me.

42:58.916 --> 43:02.333
That's why I left home when I was 15,
go and make something of myself.

43:02.416 --> 43:04.208
Look, man. We all had shitty childhoods,

43:04.291 --> 43:07.958
but that don't mean you can just
will yourself into being a movie star.

43:08.041 --> 43:11.875
Well, why not, Toney? Shit,
I willed myself into being a comedian.

43:11.958 --> 43:13.666
I willed myself into being a singer.

43:13.750 --> 43:16.250
I even made my own album
in my goddamn living room.

43:16.333 --> 43:18.041
How come I can't be in the movies?

43:23.291 --> 43:25.416
I want the world to know I exist.

43:31.750 --> 43:33.916
How much money you planning on
spending on this thing?

43:34.000 --> 43:37.125
Well, I figure, you know, with money
I got from my records, and...

43:37.208 --> 43:40.166
I go ask the label for some money,
I probably get about $70,000.

43:40.250 --> 43:41.541
That's good, Rudy.

43:41.625 --> 43:44.041
Well, hey, Rudy, how much money
you gonna pay Jimmy

43:44.125 --> 43:47.416
- for doing his shit since you know him?
- We ain't discussed that stuff yet.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.666
But you know my man
don't work for free, right?

43:49.750 --> 43:52.309
- You gon' fuck my money up.
- You know you're not working for free?

43:52.333 --> 43:55.333
Is that really enough to pay
for all the people you gonna need?

43:55.416 --> 43:57.616
At the movies, I always sit through
the closing credits,

43:57.666 --> 44:01.458
and that's a lot of folk.
Key grip, best boy.

44:01.541 --> 44:04.083
- Wish I had me a best boy.
- Okay, honey.

44:04.166 --> 44:06.833
Oh, damn, Toney, don't nobody
wanna hear all that shit, man.

44:06.916 --> 44:08.833
We having a pleasant barbecue.

44:08.916 --> 44:12.416
And besides, ain't nobody gonna be
getting called "boy" on my set.

44:12.500 --> 44:15.333
Hey, look now.
If we gonna do this shit,

44:15.416 --> 44:17.708
we gonna all have to chip in together
and help out.

44:17.791 --> 44:20.666
Now, Toney, your receipts
always add up to the penny, man,

44:20.750 --> 44:22.791
so you gonna be in charge of the money.

44:22.875 --> 44:25.333
Jimmy, your act got all them
great props and costumes,

44:25.416 --> 44:27.083
so you gonna do all that shit.

44:27.166 --> 44:31.166
And, Ben, you write the funkiest songs,
so will you please do the music?

44:31.250 --> 44:33.791
But, um, who gonna write this movie, Rudy?

44:33.875 --> 44:39.416
'Cause at the Oscars, they always say,
"It starts with the word."

44:39.500 --> 44:41.166
So who gonna write that word, Rudy?

44:41.875 --> 44:43.458
My baby!

44:44.250 --> 44:47.166
The needle took my baby!

44:49.083 --> 44:52.500
Sweet Jesus, when will this stop?

44:52.583 --> 44:54.208
I'm gonna kill that pusher.

44:54.291 --> 44:56.583
- I'm gonna make him pay!
- No!

44:57.708 --> 45:00.208
More death won't solve our problems!

45:00.291 --> 45:01.666
Well, then what will, Mom?

45:02.375 --> 45:05.500
I am not about to lose another son.

45:05.583 --> 45:08.250
What, you gonnna sit here and pray?
And cry?

45:08.916 --> 45:11.458
That's what made him turn to that junk
in the first place.

45:12.583 --> 45:14.166
Keeping it inside.

45:16.708 --> 45:19.916
It wasn't about the text,
it was about the emotions.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.625
Hey, sister. Sorry to bother you.
You is a bad motherfucker.

45:22.708 --> 45:24.500
What you did tonight, I really enjoyed it.

45:24.583 --> 45:26.750
- Oh, thank you.
- Some of the best acting I seen.

45:26.833 --> 45:29.059
I'm trying to find Jerry
that wrote the play. Where's he?

45:29.083 --> 45:30.123
Uh, right here. I'm Jerry.

45:30.166 --> 45:32.875
Hey, man! How you doing, brother?
Good to meet you.

45:32.958 --> 45:35.559
Yeah, I called you just recently,
and I sent you some of my albums.

45:35.583 --> 45:38.625
- I'm Rudy Ray Moore.
- Yes. Oh, yes, yes. A pleasure, Mr. Moore.

45:38.708 --> 45:42.083
Yeah, man. Look, I ain't even know about
this theater. It's mighty fine, though.

45:42.166 --> 45:44.333
A lot of talented brothers
and sisters wanna act,

45:44.416 --> 45:46.096
but nobody's hiring them,
know what I mean?

45:46.125 --> 45:49.375
No TV, no movies. So this is where
they come to show off their craft.

45:49.458 --> 45:50.916
That's beautiful, man.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.625
So, regarding your albums.

45:52.708 --> 45:55.291
- Right.
- I gotta be honest. I listened to them.

45:55.375 --> 45:56.875
They're not really my bag.

45:57.916 --> 45:59.875
Oh, well, brother,
you ain't got to be funny.

45:59.958 --> 46:02.916
All I want you to do is write a story
for me, all the things that happen.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.840
The good guys and the bad guys,
the cops and robbers. Them kinda things.

46:05.875 --> 46:09.500
- I'm gonna supply all the comedy.
- Oh...

46:10.250 --> 46:15.416
I can be humorous. But my work
has to inform as well as entertain.

46:15.500 --> 46:18.166
For example, my next play
is called <i>The Devil's Cotton Field.</i>

46:18.250 --> 46:22.666
It's a piece of black history
set in the country town I grew up in.

46:22.750 --> 46:24.166
It's called Varner, Arkansas.

46:24.250 --> 46:27.916
Varner. You from Varner?
Shit, I'm from Fort Smith, nigga.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.101
- All right, we got something in common.
- What, that we're both from Arkansas?

46:31.125 --> 46:33.708
That we both knew to get our black asses
out of Arkansas.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.851
Ain't nothing but canned mutton
in that motherfucker.

46:35.875 --> 46:37.000
You got that right.

46:37.083 --> 46:41.625
Rudy, I admire your tenacity,
but... I'm about my art.

46:41.708 --> 46:44.583
I write my plays,
I teach at an acting school.

46:44.666 --> 46:48.041
- I'm trying to uplift the community.
- Come on with all that bullshit, man.

46:48.125 --> 46:51.750
We both left Arkansas for L.A.,
and we doing the same hustle now.

46:51.833 --> 46:53.291
And I dig what you're doing here.

46:53.375 --> 46:55.775
This is beautiful,
bringing the people together and all that.

46:55.833 --> 46:59.250
That's what I aspire to do.
But I'm talking about something bigger.

46:59.333 --> 47:03.333
I'm talking about the opportunity
to get your message to all the people

47:03.416 --> 47:04.708
through movies.

47:06.541 --> 47:08.416
Jerry Jones movies.

47:11.541 --> 47:14.833
We want this thing to be raw.
Tell it like it is on the streets.

47:14.916 --> 47:17.625
Yeah, lots of pimps and whores
and cussing and all that shit.

47:18.666 --> 47:21.416
And kung fu, karate.
Brothers love all that kung fu.

47:21.500 --> 47:25.291
Gotta have all the kung fu and karate
and that Bruce Lee shit. They love that.

47:25.375 --> 47:27.583
I'm sorry, do... do you know karate?

47:27.666 --> 47:30.750
No, but I'm a fast learner.
I can learn how to chop me a motherfucker!

47:34.166 --> 47:35.750
You know what we should have?

47:35.833 --> 47:38.000
A all-girl kung-fu army.

47:39.250 --> 47:41.000
Um, you know, there's...

47:41.083 --> 47:43.750
...there's plenty
of story opportunity, Rudy.

47:44.375 --> 47:47.666
Across this nation, inner cities
are bein' plagued by violent crime.

47:47.750 --> 47:52.041
- I feel the government hasn't stepped up...
- That's it. It's whitey's fault.

47:52.541 --> 47:54.291
It's a corrupt government. They corrupt.

47:54.375 --> 47:57.015
The motherfucker don't care about
the people. The mayor is corrupt.

47:57.083 --> 48:00.083
He one of them Nixon motherfuckers.
And there's a exorcism.

48:00.166 --> 48:02.958
- Goddamn it, an exorcism?
- Yeah, you know, all that...

48:03.041 --> 48:05.791
"Your mother sucks cocks in hell."

48:05.875 --> 48:08.333
They love that shit.
That's they favorite dish right now.

48:08.416 --> 48:12.958
Okay. Um, I don't know how that
fits into our urban motif.

48:14.708 --> 48:18.416
Maybe you're right. I don't wanna be
cleaning up green vomit off the set.

48:18.500 --> 48:20.416
We'll put the devil in another movie.

48:21.708 --> 48:28.041
Rudy, um, in storytelling,
it's always best to, um...

48:29.166 --> 48:30.708
you know, write what you know.

48:33.125 --> 48:35.625
Now what do you mean
when you say "write what you know"?

48:35.708 --> 48:38.208
What do I... I mean...

48:38.916 --> 48:41.875
You've lived a life, you know?
You... Things you've done.

48:42.625 --> 48:45.500
So you tell stories
about your own experience.

48:45.583 --> 48:48.500
It ain't nothing talk about
my personal life whatsoever, man.

48:48.583 --> 48:51.500
Nothing interesting happen there.
I deal with the professional.

48:51.583 --> 48:53.625
- Okay, good.
- Yeah, that's the night life.

48:53.708 --> 48:55.791
And it's clubs and club owners
and promoters

48:55.875 --> 48:58.875
and mobsters, and the money
be disappearing all the time,

48:58.958 --> 49:04.416
and you got the pimps and whores
turning tricks in the walk-in freezer.

49:04.500 --> 49:05.500
That's good.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
Okay, then.

49:08.875 --> 49:11.333
Yeah. We could use all that.

D'Urville Martin? I'm Rudy Ray Moore.
You probably don't recognize me,

50:38.750 --> 50:41.375

a big afro wig,

50:41.458 --> 50:43.208

50:44.208 --> 50:45.708
Oh, well, that must be it, then.

50:46.833 --> 50:49.233

52:22.500 --> 52:24.166
Insult?

52:24.250 --> 52:26.708
- Get to truckin', baby.
- Trucking.

52:30.333 --> 52:31.791
What if we let you direct?

52:33.458 --> 52:38.166
We have got the great D'Urville Martin

52:38.250 --> 52:40.000
We got Jerry Jones writing the script,

a theme song for me

52:43.125 --> 52:46.250

What y'all think of that?

53:09.625 --> 53:12.750
Uh, Rudy, you're very persuasive.
We admire your passion.

53:12.833 --> 53:16.583
You gotta understand, Rudy.
You're not just asking for a loan here.

53:16.666 --> 53:19.875
You're asking for an advance
on future royalties.

53:19.958 --> 53:22.750
We'll do it, it's no risk to us,
but if you blow it,

53:22.833 --> 53:25.083
we're gonna own your records
till the end of time.

53:27.958 --> 53:30.666
Well, I know all that, but...

53:32.041 --> 53:35.166
I'm gonna bet on myself. Ain't nobody
gonna put me on the screen 'cept for me,

53:35.250 --> 53:37.708
and everybody I talked to
say they wanna see a Dolemite movie.

53:37.791 --> 53:40.750
Well, you understand
you're not supposed to make a movie

53:40.833 --> 53:42.833
for the five square blocks
of people you know.

53:44.583 --> 53:46.583
Well, that's fine with me,

53:46.666 --> 53:50.125
'cause every city in America
got them same five blocks,

53:50.208 --> 53:52.375
and those folks is gonna love it.

54:00.791 --> 54:01.958
This is the spot?

54:05.875 --> 54:07.541
Man, wait till you see this.

54:09.416 --> 54:12.500
Behold. The Dunbar Hotel.

54:12.583 --> 54:13.583
Holy shit.

54:22.708 --> 54:26.250
- This place is overrun with junkies.
- But we gonna clear 'em all out, man.

54:26.333 --> 54:29.458
Look, they had Universal Studios,
you got MGM Studios,

54:29.541 --> 54:32.333
and this is gonna be Dolemite Studios.

54:32.416 --> 54:34.333
- What?
- Yeah, man. Look at this.

54:34.416 --> 54:37.625
It got rooms for days. It just keeps
all over the place. Look at that.

54:37.708 --> 54:39.833
Everything we need.
We could build all our sets here.

54:39.916 --> 54:44.208
We could do Willie Green's massage parlor,
Queen Bee's whorehouse.

54:44.291 --> 54:46.416
Man, they even got a fucking club in here.

54:47.916 --> 54:50.791
- Rudy, you can't afford this place.
<i>- </i> I ain't gonna buy it.

54:50.875 --> 54:52.458
I ain't gonna have to rent it, neither.

54:52.541 --> 54:55.333
I went to the landlord and found out
that he got the BVDs up his ass

54:55.416 --> 54:58.416
about all these dopeheads in here.
I offered to clear 'em all out.

54:58.500 --> 55:01.541
I said I'd come on and do it for free
as the caretaker.

55:04.083 --> 55:06.250
Get that mattress up there

55:06.333 --> 55:09.125
and get that blanket up off there
and get all that.

55:09.208 --> 55:11.875
Get all that dust and shit
up off the ground, too.

55:11.958 --> 55:14.583
Y'all left a whole lot of shit up there
up on that counter.

55:14.666 --> 55:16.875
Did I ask about the dough I never got?

55:23.041 --> 55:24.166
One, two.

55:32.666 --> 55:35.500
Uh-uh. We ain't going shoppin'.
That's for the movie.

55:35.583 --> 55:37.416
Come on now.
Put that shit back on the rack.

55:37.500 --> 55:40.416
Hey, make sure you do
the Dolemite bedroom on the second floor.

55:40.500 --> 55:42.208
Make sure you do that kind of stylish.

55:42.291 --> 55:45.166
With red carpets and red drapes,
red bedspread, you know?

55:45.250 --> 55:46.916
Make it real comfortable in there, too.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.560
'Cause after we shoot in the day,
I'm gonna be sleeping in there.

55:50.208 --> 55:53.208
- Come again. You gon'...
- Man, after I pay for the film and camera,

55:53.291 --> 55:56.833
I can't afford my apartment no more.
I got to move in this motherfucker.

56:04.583 --> 56:07.375
- You said we were going to a sound stage.
- I know. I...

56:08.041 --> 56:09.875
I don't know what the hell this is.

56:11.125 --> 56:13.791
- Jerry.
- Hey, you made it.

56:13.875 --> 56:17.166
Hey, Rudy. Rudy, man, these are the kids
I was telling you about.

56:17.250 --> 56:19.708
- Oh.
- Good to see you, Nick. Glad you made it.

56:19.791 --> 56:20.958
Hey.

56:21.541 --> 56:24.875
Dolemite is my name,
and fuckin' up motherfuckers is my game.

56:24.958 --> 56:26.500
Oh, right. Right.

56:26.583 --> 56:31.750
Nick von Sternberg is my name,
and UCLA Film... Film School

56:31.833 --> 56:34.041
is the place that I... It's my school.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.916
- Jerry I met at the acting class.
- I was his acting teacher.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.333
I gotta tell you,
you gotta see this kid's short films.

56:40.416 --> 56:41.656
He's amazing, man. Outstanding.

56:41.708 --> 56:44.625
He look like one of them
Alfred Hitchcock motherfuckers.

56:44.708 --> 56:47.125
That's very kind of you. Um...

56:47.208 --> 56:49.833
um, currently, though,
we're looking for the... the UPM or an AD.

56:49.916 --> 56:52.208
I'm curious, are we filming
on Panavision or Arri?

56:52.291 --> 56:53.875
Oh, son.

56:53.958 --> 56:57.333
We don't know all that technical stuff.
We don't know a lot about that stuff.

56:57.416 --> 56:59.458
We got a really dedicated crew here,
you know,

56:59.541 --> 57:01.916
but the truth is, ain't nobody
been on a movie set before,

57:02.000 --> 57:06.250
so we don't know all that technical stuff
like lights and sound and camera.

57:06.333 --> 57:08.541
- You know, we don't know that.
- Of course.

57:08.625 --> 57:10.458
All right, let me show you
Dolemite Studio.

57:10.541 --> 57:12.916
Come on over here.
Look at Dolemite Studio, y'all.

57:13.000 --> 57:16.625
This where it all happen.
Yeah, this the epicenter, nucleus.

57:16.708 --> 57:18.708
Why we need these white boys
tellin' us what to do?

57:18.750 --> 57:22.000
Use your head, Ben. Don't none of us
know what the fuck we're doing.

57:22.083 --> 57:24.043
If we're gonna make a movie,
we need movie people.

57:24.083 --> 57:26.375
Don't matter
if they black, white or polka-dot.

57:26.458 --> 57:28.333
Well, I ain't takin' orders from them.

57:28.416 --> 57:31.708
You don't have to. You're the caterer.
So just feed the honkies, okay?

57:41.291 --> 57:42.375
You're welcome, sweetie.

57:43.291 --> 57:45.000
Lights already set up, fellas.

57:50.500 --> 57:54.125
Mirrors on every wall.
Where am I supposed to hide my lights?

57:58.791 --> 58:02.833
Ceiling is eight foot tall.
This is... This is impossible.

58:02.916 --> 58:05.708
Nick? There's no juice.

58:06.750 --> 58:10.208
Okay, check the downstairs panels,
see if there's juice down there.

58:10.291 --> 58:13.000
Oh, no, no, no. Ain't no electricity.

58:13.083 --> 58:16.184
Ain't no running water, neither. That's
how I got a good deal on this building.

58:16.208 --> 58:18.250
So how do I power my lights, Rudy?

58:20.083 --> 58:22.666
Why come somebody can't just
climb up this pole here

58:22.750 --> 58:24.166
and steal it from next door?

58:25.500 --> 58:26.500
I'm on it.

58:31.500 --> 58:33.041
Rudy. Rudy.

58:34.791 --> 58:36.166
Is that the DP?

58:38.125 --> 58:41.041
- Is that the what?
<i>- </i> The DP. Director of photography.

58:41.125 --> 58:43.708
Oh, yeah, that's him.
That's our director of photography.

58:43.791 --> 58:45.750
How old is that cat, man?

58:45.833 --> 58:46.875
I don't know.

58:47.791 --> 58:48.791
Sixteen.

58:49.291 --> 58:52.000
- Twenty.
- Oh, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.

58:52.750 --> 58:55.333
Do you have any idea
what you doing, man?

58:56.416 --> 58:59.458
Look, man, you need a DP
that knows how to shoot black peoples.

58:59.541 --> 59:03.041
Whoa. Whoa, man. That's some
racist shit you talking about.

59:03.125 --> 59:05.666
No, it's not. It's not racist.
It's a fact.

59:05.750 --> 59:09.291
Look, look, look.
Black people absorb light.

59:09.916 --> 59:12.083
White people reflect light.

59:13.500 --> 59:15.791
This is cinemagical reality.

59:18.250 --> 59:22.083
Another reality is this room is giving me
a headache. What else we got?

59:24.458 --> 59:26.250
- Oh.
- Shit.

59:26.333 --> 59:28.291
Goddamn.

59:28.375 --> 59:30.708
Yeah, we gotta
get these floors fixed, Jimmy.

59:31.416 --> 59:33.708
I mean, is anything around here useful?

59:35.166 --> 59:36.166
Anything?

59:45.791 --> 59:46.875
Oh, shit.

01:00:06.416 --> 01:00:08.708
- Yeah.
- You did it.

01:00:08.791 --> 01:00:11.500
All right, man, we in production.

01:00:11.583 --> 01:00:14.291
It just feels like too much.
There's a cop on every page.

01:00:14.375 --> 01:00:16.416
- I gotta do some cuts.
- All right, get some sleep.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:18.333
We'll take care of it tomorrow.

01:00:18.416 --> 01:00:20.351
- All right.
- We're gonna kill this shit tomorrow.

01:00:20.375 --> 01:00:21.735
Absolutely. I'll see you tomorrow.

01:00:21.791 --> 01:00:24.125
We gonna have a good first day
tomorrow. Go get some sleep.

01:00:24.208 --> 01:00:26.500
- Good night.
- All right, good night, mama. <i>Arigato.</i>

01:00:27.166 --> 01:00:28.166
'Night, man.

01:00:29.458 --> 01:00:30.791
Ah, shit.

01:00:31.833 --> 01:00:35.666
Rudy, um, I'm scared about tomorrow.

01:00:36.875 --> 01:00:39.958
Oh, don't be scared. It's gonna be
just like when we went up onstage.

01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:42.958
No, it ain't, Rudy. I don't even like
getting my picture taken.

01:00:43.041 --> 01:00:45.375
I'm always trying to suck in
my motherfucking gut

01:00:45.458 --> 01:00:46.875
so I can look the best I can.

01:00:46.958 --> 01:00:50.750
And I talked to that, uh,
long-haired boy with the camera.

01:00:50.833 --> 01:00:51.916
He said in the movies,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.250
it's like they taking a picture
24 times per second.

01:00:56.333 --> 01:00:59.250
- Yeah, but that...
- No, 24 times, Rudy?

01:00:59.333 --> 01:01:02.541
And then that picture
fucking lasts forever and ever,

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:04.041
long past you dead and gone.

01:01:04.125 --> 01:01:06.125
I don't know about this shit, nigga.

01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:18.458
"Twenty-four hours
to get out of town, Willie Green.

01:01:19.416 --> 01:01:22.958
Willie Green, I'm giving you 24 hours
to get out of town.

01:01:24.416 --> 01:01:26.583
And... And 23 of 'em is already gone.

01:01:26.666 --> 01:01:29.916
Willie Green, I'm giving you 24 hours
to get out of town.

01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:33.125
And 23 of 'em is already gone."
That's good.

01:01:34.166 --> 01:01:37.541
"You got 24 hours to get out of town,
and twenty...

01:01:38.541 --> 01:01:39.625
twenty-three..."

01:01:41.625 --> 01:01:46.791
You got 24 hours to get out of town,
and 23 is already gone, motherfucker.

01:01:48.791 --> 01:01:50.041
Twenty-three is...

01:01:59.208 --> 01:02:00.875
You dirty motherfucker.

01:02:01.791 --> 01:02:05.958
You told me I wasn't shit, huh?
You the one that ain't shit.

01:02:06.041 --> 01:02:07.833
Look at me now, motherfucker.

01:02:09.708 --> 01:02:12.000
Wanna know who I am? I'm Dolemite.

01:02:13.708 --> 01:02:15.041
Fucking farmer.

01:02:15.916 --> 01:02:20.333
Dolemite is my name,
and fucking up motherfuckers is my game,

01:02:20.416 --> 01:02:25.583
you no-business-born,
rat-soup-eating, insecure motherfucker.

01:02:34.958 --> 01:02:39.000
Dolemite is my name,
and fucking up motherfuckers is my game.

01:02:41.166 --> 01:02:47.458
No-business-born, insecure,
junkyard-rat-soup-eating motherfucker!

01:03:00.333 --> 01:03:02.583
So, how'd you find yourself
on this production?

01:03:02.666 --> 01:03:06.916
- Oh, well, actually, I'm Rudy's protegée.
- Ah.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.708
Yeah. I think, um,
what they call in Hollywood, um...

01:03:10.791 --> 01:03:12.458
an ingenue.

01:03:12.541 --> 01:03:14.208
- Ah.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.125
How did you become a part of this film?

01:03:16.208 --> 01:03:17.125
Well...

01:03:17.208 --> 01:03:21.875
I sort of specialize in playing
the bad white guy around town.

01:03:21.958 --> 01:03:24.666
- Mm-hmm.
- All the black shows need a heavy.

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:28.166
I played the plantation owner
at the Ebony Showcase.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:31.333
I played a Southern lyncher
at the Cultural Center.

01:03:31.416 --> 01:03:35.333
And I played a rapist
at the Wilshire Ebell.

01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:41.208
Okay. So you just basically figured out
what you're good at, huh?

01:03:43.541 --> 01:03:45.208
This scene makes no fucking sense.

01:03:45.291 --> 01:03:46.666
Why don't it make sense?

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:50.916
Why would the warden release the prisoner
so that he can go undercover?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.625
Because there is a drug issue
in the neighborhood.

01:03:53.708 --> 01:03:55.668
We're dealing with society.
We're keepin' it real.

01:03:55.708 --> 01:03:58.750
Aw, come on, man. Come on.

01:03:59.625 --> 01:04:01.291
Look, you cats is pretending.

01:04:01.958 --> 01:04:06.583
You pretending like the warden
is a policeman, but he ain't.

01:04:06.666 --> 01:04:08.291
Wardens don't investigate.

01:04:08.375 --> 01:04:11.875
You forgetting that the warden
is working with the governor!

01:04:11.958 --> 01:04:14.125
- Thank you.
- Who gives a shit?

01:04:14.208 --> 01:04:15.541
How's it make any sense?

01:04:15.625 --> 01:04:18.625
Because the governor
is friends with Queen Bee.

01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:23.666
Jibber. Jabber.

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:25.291
- What?
- Jibber-jabber.

01:04:25.375 --> 01:04:27.083
- How is it jibber-jabber?
- How is that?

01:04:27.166 --> 01:04:29.083
You telling me
that just because the governor

01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:31.833
is tight with the woman
that own the whorehouse

01:04:31.916 --> 01:04:34.541
that he make the prison
release her friend?

01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:35.750
Yes!

01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:40.208
Fuck it. Y'all do what you wanna do.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.240
- What do you think about the lighting?
- Why don't we turn off all of the lights?

01:04:44.291 --> 01:04:46.166
That way, we don't have to
look at the scene.

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.416
- Hey, man, that ain't cool.
- Ow. Ow.

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.125
I know you Mr. Big Time,

01:04:50.208 --> 01:04:52.750
but the rest of us ain't never done
no shit like this before.

01:04:52.833 --> 01:04:55.976
I'm paying for this whole goddamn thing,
and I ain't got no fucking ego about it.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.750
If a box need to get moved,
I will move the box,

01:04:58.833 --> 01:04:59.913
and if the crew get hungry,

01:04:59.958 --> 01:05:02.083
I go downstairs
and start making sandwiches.

01:05:02.875 --> 01:05:06.041
'Cause we are here to work together
to make a movie!

01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:11.458
It's cool, baby. No smoke, man.
Everything cool.

01:05:13.375 --> 01:05:16.916
Scene two... warden's office.
Take one marker.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Action.

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:21.000
Sit down, Dolemite.

01:05:22.958 --> 01:05:25.333
You know Mama Queen Bee here,
I'm sure.

01:05:26.291 --> 01:05:27.541
For damn near two years,

01:05:27.625 --> 01:05:30.000
she's been bugging me
about your innocence.

01:05:30.666 --> 01:05:32.750
And you know the funny thing?

01:05:32.833 --> 01:05:33.875
I believe her.

01:05:34.916 --> 01:05:38.791
We've stumbled onto some facts
that may set you free.

01:05:43.791 --> 01:05:46.375
Now, you're a gambling man, aren't you?

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.208
It depends on the game, Warden,
and how high the stakes are.

01:05:52.666 --> 01:05:54.791
Well, I might as well level with you.

01:05:54.875 --> 01:05:59.666
The game is rough,
and the stake is your life.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.583
Damn, that was so real!

01:06:09.666 --> 01:06:12.458
You see how he was staring at me?
I got a chill down my back.

01:06:12.541 --> 01:06:14.333
Man, that was some good shit.

01:06:14.416 --> 01:06:17.666
This gonna be a good scene.
Man, I can't wait to watch this movie.

01:06:17.791 --> 01:06:19.166
Hey, when can we watch the movie?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.625
- Cut.
- Cut!

01:06:21.708 --> 01:06:23.041
Cut! Cut!

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.625
Scene three... take one marker.

01:06:28.708 --> 01:06:30.250
Action.

01:06:31.625 --> 01:06:32.625
Hold it, Dolemite.

01:06:35.041 --> 01:06:36.041
What do you want?

01:06:36.791 --> 01:06:37.916
FBI.

01:06:39.916 --> 01:06:41.833
What do you want, man?
Where's your warrant at?

01:06:41.916 --> 01:06:44.666
This badge is my warrant.
Open up the trunk.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.041
There's nothing in my trunk, man.

01:06:49.125 --> 01:06:50.375
Open the trunk!

01:06:54.125 --> 01:06:56.565
That shit ain't mine.
I don't know how it got in there.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.458
You going to jail for a long time.

01:07:01.541 --> 01:07:03.333
You gonna have to take me!

01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:17.666
Cut! Cut. Cut.

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:26.416
Is there any angle
that you could shoot this

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.541
where it looks
like he's actually kicking him?

01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:31.708
There's no such angle.

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:36.333
Roll it.

01:07:37.375 --> 01:07:38.583
Goddamn it.

01:07:39.416 --> 01:07:40.416
Action!

01:07:45.833 --> 01:07:47.708
I don't understand this cat.

01:07:48.291 --> 01:07:50.416
He pretending like he know karate.

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:53.666
Pretending like he could be a sex machine.

01:07:53.916 --> 01:07:56.708
Like a little kid playin' dress-up.

01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:04.458
- What planet is this cat on?
- That's for fucking with me,

01:08:04.541 --> 01:08:09.750
you no-business-born, insecure,
junkyard-rat-soup-eating motherfuckers!

01:08:21.457 --> 01:08:23.166
Cut!

01:08:30.625 --> 01:08:31.666
How was that?

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.041
I see no reason to do... it again.

01:08:38.707 --> 01:08:40.166

- <i>♪ Dolemite, Dolemite, Dolemite ♪</i>

01:11:39.625 --> 01:11:41.458
Fuck a dead duck!

01:11:41.541 --> 01:11:42.791
<i>♪ Dolemite, Dolemite ♪</i>

01:11:42.875 --> 01:11:45.708
- Payday, man. Have a happy Fourth of July.
- <i>♪ Dolemite, Dolemite ♪</i>

01:11:45.791 --> 01:11:48.208
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, man. Happy Fourth.

01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:51.125
Happy Fourth, man. All right.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.750
Tomorrow's the big day.

01:11:56.541 --> 01:11:58.000
What you talking about, Ben?

01:11:58.083 --> 01:12:00.083
Tomorrow... your big sex scene.

01:12:00.791 --> 01:12:02.666
You slick, man,
putting that scene in the movie

01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:05.375
- just so you could fuck the white girl.
- Don't be nervous.

01:12:06.458 --> 01:12:08.708
Guess that's why you the boss.

01:12:09.333 --> 01:12:12.000
Ben, you know, we ain't really fuckin'.
It's, you know, pretend.

01:12:12.083 --> 01:12:13.416
Whatever you say, boss.

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.791
- Good night, Mr. Moore.
- 'Night, ladies.

01:12:27.125 --> 01:12:28.125
Yeah.

01:12:29.583 --> 01:12:32.416
Don't let that fire hit...

01:12:35.208 --> 01:12:37.291
Why in the fuck did Jerry
have to put this sex scene

01:12:37.375 --> 01:12:38.495
in the middle of this movie?

01:12:38.541 --> 01:12:42.875
Because you the leading man, nigga,
and you have all these half-naked girls.

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:45.958
Shit, the folks gonna wanna see you
fuck one or two of 'em at least.

01:12:46.666 --> 01:12:51.125
I could put my foot in somebody's ass,
and I could be funny, but...

01:12:51.208 --> 01:12:54.875
I ain't no Billy Dee Williams, you know?
I got this big ol' belly.

01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:58.375
Everybody gonna be standing around.
I don't know what to do.

01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:02.291
When my ex used to try to
climb on top of me to bust a nut,

01:13:02.375 --> 01:13:05.000
I would check the fuck out
till the shit was over.

01:13:05.083 --> 01:13:07.125
And in the meantime,
I tried to amuse myself,

01:13:07.208 --> 01:13:10.625
so I'd just pretend that he was fuckin'
some mangy-ass donkey we had,

01:13:10.708 --> 01:13:14.041
and I be just sitting there
laughing and laughing...

01:13:14.125 --> 01:13:17.666
and his dumb ass
didn't even know the goddamn difference.

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:19.666
Lady Reed, that ain't help me at all.

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:25.791
I don't know. Maybe I'm just saying
it don't have to be all sexy and serious.

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:28.208
You know, maybe it could...

01:13:30.541 --> 01:13:31.541
It can be funny.

01:13:32.416 --> 01:13:34.458
Exactly. It could be funny.

01:13:42.791 --> 01:13:44.416
Sex scene... take one.

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.708
Act-ion.

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:23.875
Ooh.

01:14:23.958 --> 01:14:25.458
Give it to me, Dolemite.

01:14:26.166 --> 01:14:27.625
Oh, yeah.

01:14:28.375 --> 01:14:29.375
Ooh.

01:14:30.083 --> 01:14:31.083
Yes.

01:14:31.958 --> 01:14:35.291
Dolemite. Oh.

01:14:35.375 --> 01:14:36.833
Oh, give it to me.

01:14:38.208 --> 01:14:39.958
Yes! Oh!

01:14:41.125 --> 01:14:42.500
Oh, give it to me.

01:14:45.958 --> 01:14:49.291
Oh. Oh, Dolemite. Oh, yes.

01:14:49.375 --> 01:14:52.250
- Put your weight on it!
- Ooh, Dolemite, give it to me.

01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:55.208
Oh, Dolemite. Yes!

01:14:58.583 --> 01:14:59.583
Oh, yes.

01:15:00.958 --> 01:15:02.875
- Yes.
<i>- </i> Put your weight on it!

01:15:07.625 --> 01:15:08.750
Yes!

01:15:11.041 --> 01:15:12.125
Blow that shit up.

01:15:24.958 --> 01:15:25.958
Cut.

01:15:32.625 --> 01:15:33.625
Yes!

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.791
What... What happened?

01:15:39.291 --> 01:15:43.125
I wrote a tender,
realistic love scene, okay?

01:15:43.208 --> 01:15:46.083
My whole goal with this movie
was to tell it like it is.

01:15:46.166 --> 01:15:48.625
I dunno if it was tender,
I dunno if it was sexy,

01:15:48.708 --> 01:15:50.916
but it was funny as fuck.

01:15:55.958 --> 01:15:56.958
Ooh, Lord.

01:15:57.833 --> 01:15:59.208
Two!

01:15:59.291 --> 01:16:00.458
- Three!
- Hyah.

01:16:00.541 --> 01:16:01.583
- Four!
- Hyah.

01:16:01.666 --> 01:16:02.666
Five.

01:16:03.083 --> 01:16:04.500
- One!
- Hyah.

01:16:04.583 --> 01:16:05.750
- Two!
- Hyah.

01:16:05.833 --> 01:16:08.500
- Three! Four!
- Rudy? We... We gotta talk.

01:16:08.583 --> 01:16:12.500
- Man, I'm trying to memorize this kung fu.
- I know. We got a real problem.

01:16:12.583 --> 01:16:13.666
Hyah.

01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:15.041
- One!
- Hyah.

01:16:15.125 --> 01:16:16.125
- Two!
- Hyah.

01:16:16.208 --> 01:16:17.375
- Three!
- Hyah.

01:16:17.458 --> 01:16:18.583
- Four!
- Hyah.

01:16:18.666 --> 01:16:19.875
We ran out of film.

01:16:21.208 --> 01:16:23.958
Man, what you talking about?
What happened to all them little pieces?

01:16:24.041 --> 01:16:26.500
I know. The short ends.
We used them all and...

01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:27.625
Hyah. Hyah.

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:29.041
Look, I spoke to the crew.

01:16:29.125 --> 01:16:31.708
They've been working under their rate
for a few weeks now.

01:16:31.791 --> 01:16:33.958
And I've been working for free
for a few days,

01:16:34.041 --> 01:16:37.875
and we're... we're on your side,
but if there's no film in the camera...

01:16:38.666 --> 01:16:40.916
- there's... there's no movie.
- One!

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.208
- Hyah.
- Two!

01:16:42.291 --> 01:16:43.625
- Hyah.
- One!

01:16:43.708 --> 01:16:44.750
- Hyah.
- Two!

01:16:44.833 --> 01:16:45.958
- Hyah.
- One!

01:16:46.041 --> 01:16:47.291
Hyah!

01:16:47.375 --> 01:16:50.750
Another ten grand's not that simple, Rudy.
It's a lot of fucking money.

01:16:50.833 --> 01:16:53.708
If this thing flops, you're working
for free for the rest of your life.

01:16:53.791 --> 01:16:56.041
Oh, like I'm-a be y'all's slave then, huh?

01:16:56.125 --> 01:16:58.750
- Oh, come on.
- Don't go there, Rudy.

01:16:58.833 --> 01:17:01.833
You created this situation.
Don't you go there.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.166
Did you put in any contingency
for overruns?

01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:07.916
Editing? Post?

01:17:10.291 --> 01:17:13.083
If that means mo' money,
then, no, I'm busted.

01:17:14.208 --> 01:17:17.625
But I can't go back there and tell 'em
to stop now. It'll crush everybody.

01:17:18.458 --> 01:17:21.208
Everybody put so much
into this fucking movie, man.

01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:24.541
I don't wanna let 'em down like that.
Come on, man. We just an inch away.

01:17:24.625 --> 01:17:26.958
Let us finish this fucking movie, please.

01:17:32.541 --> 01:17:33.666
Okay, Rudy.

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:38.125
- All right. Okay.
- Rudy. You all right?

01:17:38.208 --> 01:17:40.041
Okay, yeah, that's pretty good.

01:17:41.041 --> 01:17:42.041
Straight.

01:17:49.875 --> 01:17:53.333
You know, I worked with this actor once
on <i>Rosemary's Baby.</i>

01:17:53.416 --> 01:17:55.041
It's John Cassavetes.

01:17:56.125 --> 01:17:57.583
He makes movies, too.

01:17:58.750 --> 01:18:01.125
Down and dirty just like you, man.

01:18:01.208 --> 01:18:02.875
Yeah, I get it, D'Urville. You big time.

01:18:02.958 --> 01:18:05.500
Yeah, man, he put up his last dime
to get it done.

01:18:05.583 --> 01:18:07.708
Whatever it take to get it done.

01:18:07.791 --> 01:18:09.291
Yeah, man, we gonna get it done.

01:18:09.375 --> 01:18:11.375
No, look, man. You ain't listening to me.

01:18:12.833 --> 01:18:16.708
Whatever you've been feeling
about me, about the money men,

01:18:16.791 --> 01:18:19.291
about anybody who's ever doubted you...

01:18:20.458 --> 01:18:22.500
I want you to use it.

01:18:24.791 --> 01:18:26.833
Connect to it, man.

01:18:26.916 --> 01:18:31.083
Dig down inside, connect to it,
and use it.

01:18:31.166 --> 01:18:32.208
Put it on camera.

01:18:34.208 --> 01:18:36.583
Yeah. Use it, baby.

01:18:37.458 --> 01:18:38.500
Use it.

01:19:29.125 --> 01:19:30.291
Dolemite.

01:19:31.291 --> 01:19:32.625
Come sit down.

01:19:34.458 --> 01:19:35.833
Have a drink with us.

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:41.791
Willie Green, I'm giving you 24 hours
to get out of town,

01:19:41.875 --> 01:19:43.833
and 23 done already passed.

01:19:45.791 --> 01:19:46.916
You cheated me.

01:19:48.125 --> 01:19:49.625
I want a new deal.

01:19:50.375 --> 01:19:51.375
Partners.

01:19:53.083 --> 01:19:55.375
You're really good at your business.

01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:59.250
You handle the business,
I'll handle the heat.

01:20:00.083 --> 01:20:01.666
What do you say?

01:20:02.291 --> 01:20:03.291
Fuck you, man.

01:20:11.041 --> 01:20:13.291
Give me the gun.

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:14.500
Give me the gun!

01:20:16.375 --> 01:20:18.541
I'm gonna kill Dolemite!

01:20:19.791 --> 01:20:21.333
Don't want no sweat?

01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:23.041
Turn this sucker out!

01:20:29.916 --> 01:20:32.541
Fuck 'em up, girls!

01:20:32.625 --> 01:20:35.041
- Hyah!
<i>- </i> Fight scene... take one.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.291
- Ah-yah.
- Fifty-five alpha, take one.

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:04.083
Alpha... take one.

01:21:06.916 --> 01:21:08.000
Oh, yeah!

01:21:16.666 --> 01:21:18.291
And stay down, motherfucker.

01:21:18.958 --> 01:21:21.291
Yeah, come on, Willie.
Come on, Willie Green.

01:21:27.041 --> 01:21:28.041
No, Willie Green!

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.125
Damn it. Cheap-ass...

01:21:54.958 --> 01:21:57.166
Goddamn, Dolemite.

01:22:06.958 --> 01:22:09.958
Now it's off of you. It's on me.

01:22:20.625 --> 01:22:23.041
And cut.

01:22:27.291 --> 01:22:28.541
We done?

01:22:28.625 --> 01:22:29.625
Mm-hmm.

01:22:33.416 --> 01:22:34.416
We done.

01:22:37.125 --> 01:22:40.458
That's it, y'all. We're done.
Thank God for that shit.

01:22:40.541 --> 01:22:42.708
Oh, Lord, this was a living hell.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:45.833
I don't know how I got myself into this,
but they say sometimes you...

01:22:45.916 --> 01:22:48.041
got to go through hell to get to heaven.

01:22:48.125 --> 01:22:51.958
And that's exactly where I'm going.
I just got a call from <i>Black Caesar.</i>

01:22:52.041 --> 01:22:54.333
Fred Williamson. He's my friend.

01:22:54.416 --> 01:22:55.916
We're gonna do a real movie.

01:22:58.583 --> 01:22:59.583
Damn.

01:23:00.958 --> 01:23:03.625
So I wanted to say y'all did a good job.

01:23:05.166 --> 01:23:07.541
Crew, stunt peoples...

01:23:08.208 --> 01:23:09.208
whores.

01:23:10.875 --> 01:23:15.125
I'm going on now. I'll see y'all
at the... at the premiere. Okay.

01:23:22.375 --> 01:23:25.541
No, no, no.
Probably won't be a premiere, so...

01:23:29.166 --> 01:23:30.666
Some bullshit.

01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:36.333
- Man, fuck him.
- Yeah.

01:23:36.416 --> 01:23:37.750
I like the movie.

01:23:37.833 --> 01:23:41.458
Yeah, me too. Fuck,
I think the motherfucker was a four-star.

01:23:41.541 --> 01:23:44.375
- Rudy, you did it. We made a movie.
- That's amazing shit.

01:23:44.458 --> 01:23:45.500
Yeah, we did.

01:23:45.583 --> 01:23:48.916
Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's not over
until you say, "That's a wrap."

01:23:52.166 --> 01:23:53.625
All right, y'all, that's a wrap.

01:23:53.708 --> 01:23:56.958
- No, no, no, no.
- Give us a Dolemite wrap.

01:23:59.875 --> 01:24:02.166
That's a motherfuckin' wrap!

01:24:04.916 --> 01:24:07.250
That's a no-business-born!

01:24:07.333 --> 01:24:08.333
Insecure!

01:24:08.416 --> 01:24:11.916
Barnyard motherfuckin' wrap!

01:24:12.625 --> 01:24:13.625
Yeah!

01:24:22.916 --> 01:24:25.916
I'm a bad motherfucker, dude.
We made a hell of a movie.

01:24:27.125 --> 01:24:30.416
Congratulations, y'all.
We made this motherfucking movie!

01:25:12.375 --> 01:25:14.375
Comedian International.
How may I help you?

01:25:15.875 --> 01:25:18.208
Oh, no, Mr. Moore is available.
One second, please.

01:25:23.125 --> 01:25:25.500
Yes, this is Rudy Ray Moore.
Who am I speaking with?

01:25:26.375 --> 01:25:30.125
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Did you get a chance
to review my production?

01:25:31.625 --> 01:25:34.541
You did? Yes, okay. What...

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.583
Well, yes, it was a real movie.

01:25:37.666 --> 01:25:40.666
It is a actual real movie,
and everybody got paid, yes.

01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:43.458
Yes, very professional production. Right.

01:25:44.083 --> 01:25:46.791
No, I learned-I learned kung fu
for the movie.

01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:49.208
I didn't know kung fu
before I started the movie.

01:25:49.958 --> 01:25:54.958
Yes. Oh, no, you... Yeah, you're right.
This was Lady Reed's first production.

01:25:55.041 --> 01:25:58.583
Right, this was her motion-picture debut.

01:25:58.666 --> 01:25:59.666
Uh-huh.

01:26:01.833 --> 01:26:02.833
Really?

01:26:03.666 --> 01:26:04.708
Oh, well.

01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:09.416
Well, you know, we was gonna do
a fresh new edit on

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:13.500
and was gonna change a couple of things
and a re-shoot for-for the ending.

01:26:13.583 --> 01:26:14.958
Change the ending ar...

01:26:15.958 --> 01:26:16.958
Right.

01:26:18.375 --> 01:26:19.375
Okay.

01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:23.750
All right, well, yeah.
No, we totally understand.

01:26:24.875 --> 01:26:27.708
Yeah, man, thank you so much
for your consideration.

01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:46.666
Well... at least we had a good time.

01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:48.458
You know what, Ben? Fuck you, man.

01:26:48.541 --> 01:26:51.083
Your ass had fun 'cause you ain't
have to pay for all this shit.

01:26:51.166 --> 01:26:52.750
I'm in debt up to my ears.

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:55.476
I gave all my record royalties
to the Bihari Brothers,

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:57.333
and don't nobody want this damn movie.

01:26:58.041 --> 01:26:59.541
Nigga, you got a whole lot of nerve

01:26:59.625 --> 01:27:01.958
ordering a extra side of greens
at a time like this.

01:27:02.041 --> 01:27:03.625
Pay for these fucking greens yourself.

01:27:03.708 --> 01:27:05.958
In fact, you're gonna all start paying
for your own shit,

01:27:06.041 --> 01:27:08.333
'cause I ain't no fucking endless faucet
of fucking money.

01:27:08.416 --> 01:27:10.625
Here, you pay for them waffles,
you pay for that burger,

01:27:10.708 --> 01:27:12.666
you pay for your shit,
your extra greens, nigga.

01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:13.875
You're having strawberries.

01:27:13.958 --> 01:27:16.791
You pay for your motherfucking
strawberries your damn self.

01:27:16.875 --> 01:27:19.291
I don't understand your attitude.

01:27:19.375 --> 01:27:22.750
I mean, it ain't like you ain't
never been told no before, Rudy.

01:27:22.833 --> 01:27:26.208
- I mean, you're the comeback king, man.
- Yeah, when we doing stuff I know about.

01:27:26.291 --> 01:27:28.833
Nightclubs and records.
Those is my world, okay?

01:27:28.916 --> 01:27:31.958
A man slam a door in my face,
I just find another door.

01:27:32.041 --> 01:27:33.333
Thought anybody could be a star.

01:27:33.416 --> 01:27:37.791
But apparently don't nobody wanna see
our ugly black ass up on the screen!

01:27:37.875 --> 01:27:40.041
Strawberry shortcake-eating motherfucker.

01:27:40.125 --> 01:27:42.791
- Hey, man, I like strawberry... Rudy!
- Come on, Rudy!

01:27:43.708 --> 01:27:46.958
<i>Yes, I was born
in a barrel of butcher knives,</i>

01:27:47.041 --> 01:27:50.375
then shot in the ass twice
with two Colt .45s.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:55.250
Yes, I been slapped by a bear
and bit by an eel.

01:27:56.125 --> 01:27:59.375
I chew up railroad iron,
and I shit out steel.

01:28:04.625 --> 01:28:07.958
Yes, I was kicked out of South America
for fucking steers.

01:28:08.708 --> 01:28:11.791
<i>I fucked the she-elephant
till she broke down to tears.</i>

01:28:15.625 --> 01:28:18.333
<i>I just can't believe
I'm back here on this grind.</i>

01:28:19.625 --> 01:28:21.500
<i>I'm actually worse off than I was before,</i>

01:28:21.583 --> 01:28:23.458
'cause I don't even own my records
no more.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.916
Now what kind of fool works so hard
to build something up like that

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.500
and just throw the shit all away?

01:28:30.583 --> 01:28:31.916
Ah-ah. Mm-mm.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.708
No, Rudy. You ain't no fool now.
Watch your mouth.

01:28:37.083 --> 01:28:39.083
I thought that movie
was gon' change everything,

01:28:39.166 --> 01:28:40.875
make me a fucking star.

01:28:45.375 --> 01:28:47.458
Well, you're still a star to me.

01:28:51.375 --> 01:28:52.791
Okay.

01:28:53.875 --> 01:28:55.125
Good night, Lady Reed.

01:28:55.791 --> 01:28:56.791
<i>Good night, Rudy.</i>

01:29:05.583 --> 01:29:10.625
<i>Bobby Vale in the Morning,</i>
WFKK, Indianapolis.

01:29:10.708 --> 01:29:14.625
And we are so excited
to have Mr. Rudy Ray Moore,

01:29:14.708 --> 01:29:18.083
the man, the legend,
the phenomenon in studio.

01:29:18.166 --> 01:29:22.541
I'm looking right at him.
I'm sittin' with him right now,

01:29:22.625 --> 01:29:26.625
and he's gonna be in Indianapolis
all week performing at Gordy's Lounge,

01:29:26.708 --> 01:29:28.208
so give it up for Mr. Rudy Ray Moore.

01:29:28.291 --> 01:29:30.833
All right, man.
Really happy to be here today.

01:29:30.916 --> 01:29:34.125
Now, Rudy, I gotta ask you this
'cause I'm a hell of a fan.

01:29:34.208 --> 01:29:35.208
Yeah, man.

01:29:35.291 --> 01:29:39.375
There's a rumor
that you made a Dolemite movie.

01:29:39.458 --> 01:29:41.750
Is that true? And if it is,
when can we see this movie?

01:29:41.833 --> 01:29:43.583
I wish I could answer the question, y'all,

01:29:43.666 --> 01:29:47.541
but I really can't answer the question
at this time, 'cause I just don't know.

01:29:48.791 --> 01:29:50.375
You're not gon' give us nothing?

01:29:50.458 --> 01:29:54.291
I-I really can't really
give y'all the date...

01:29:54.375 --> 01:29:55.416
A hint.

01:29:56.041 --> 01:29:58.583
If I had a hint, I give it to y'all, man.
You know me.

01:29:58.666 --> 01:30:00.083
You know if I had a date,

01:30:00.166 --> 01:30:02.958
I'd tell y'all right now,
but I don't know nothin'.

01:30:04.125 --> 01:30:08.416
Hey, we'll be right back
with Rudy Ray Moore.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:13.083
This is Bobby Vale, WFKK, Indianapolis.

01:30:20.958 --> 01:30:23.291
What the fuck is your problem, man?

01:30:23.375 --> 01:30:25.416
I'm tryin' to help you out.

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:28.458
I'm in here promoting you, and you won't
even answer my fuckin' questions.

01:30:28.541 --> 01:30:31.041
Hey, look, Bobby.
I can't answer your goddamn question

01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:34.000
'cause the movie
ain't never comin' out, okay?

01:30:34.083 --> 01:30:37.166
- That don't make no sense.
- Yeah, but it's true. It's done.

01:30:37.250 --> 01:30:40.958
Don't nobody wanna show the motherfucker.
I don't know what to do, man.

01:30:41.958 --> 01:30:43.333
You know what?

01:30:44.916 --> 01:30:47.125
I got a cousin

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:50.416
that manages a movie theater
called Uptown.

01:30:51.291 --> 01:30:52.458
Maybe...

01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:55.041
should give him a call.

01:30:58.750 --> 01:30:59.791
But what's he gonna do?

01:30:59.875 --> 01:31:03.583
I don't know. Maybe run it.
Play your damn movie. Fuck it. Can't hurt.

01:31:04.375 --> 01:31:06.000
And we are back.

01:31:14.791 --> 01:31:17.041
Now, we don't have
a midnight movie on Friday,

01:31:17.125 --> 01:31:20.000
so I suppose we could do it then.

01:31:20.083 --> 01:31:21.791
How does $500 sound?

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.916
That sounds fair. Perfect.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.791
So, when can I receive my advance?

01:31:27.875 --> 01:31:30.666
- What? Advance?
- The money. When you gonna pay me?

01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:34.166
No. You see,
this is what they call four-walling.

01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:38.541
Yeah. You pay me,
and then you get all the ticket sales.

01:31:39.166 --> 01:31:40.916
We did it with <i>Billy Jack.</i>

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.166
And I think we even did it
with <i>Grizzly Adams.</i>

01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:46.666
Man, you could clean up
if you successful.

01:31:48.083 --> 01:31:50.416
So I got to pay to show my movie?

01:31:54.375 --> 01:31:57.250
Well, goddamn. Am I gonna get
some of the popcorn money?

01:31:57.333 --> 01:32:01.291
Oh, that's mine.
But you get all the box office.

01:32:01.375 --> 01:32:04.875
Now, if you promote the shit
out the movie...

01:32:04.958 --> 01:32:07.000
aw, you could make some serious bread.

01:32:30.833 --> 01:32:33.875
Toney. I need you to break
into a hotel right now.

01:32:33.958 --> 01:32:35.500
The Dunbar, man!

01:32:35.583 --> 01:32:38.083
Look, I need you to go up
into my bedroom in the Dunbar

01:32:38.166 --> 01:32:41.666
and get all five reels
and put 'em on a plane tonight!

01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:43.500
I need that movie in Indianapolis
right now!

01:32:44.666 --> 01:32:46.791
Hey, my man. Hey, brother,
don't miss it. This Friday.

01:32:46.875 --> 01:32:49.208
Uptown Theater.
Dolemite in person, live in person.

01:32:49.291 --> 01:32:52.291
That's me, Rudy Ray Moore, baby.
Come on down and check me out.

01:32:52.375 --> 01:32:54.083
Ladies, come on down
to the Uptown Theater.

01:32:54.166 --> 01:32:56.934
Shit, we don't want you all up
into any damn movie with your tight ass.

01:32:56.958 --> 01:32:58.375
You got the cutest little baby.

01:32:58.458 --> 01:33:02.416
Hi, little baby. Jibbee, jibbee.
Come down to Dolemite Theater, all right?

01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:05.541
Can't bring the baby, though.
Brother, come to the theater tomorrow.

01:33:05.625 --> 01:33:11.291
<i>If you crave satisfaction,
this is the place to find that action.</i>

01:33:11.375 --> 01:33:14.958
<i>Coming to the Uptown Theater
as its next attraction!</i>

01:33:15.041 --> 01:33:18.791
<i>A movie guaranteed

01:33:18.875 --> 01:33:21.583
<i>Dolemite! Dolemite!</i>

01:33:21.666 --> 01:33:24.750
Hey, baby! Make sure
you get down there, mama!

01:33:25.916 --> 01:33:28.250
Bobby Vale, WFKK.

01:33:28.333 --> 01:33:32.750
We're givin' out two tickets
to the tenth caller to the Dolemite movie.

01:33:32.833 --> 01:33:35.791
<i>Tonight. Midnight screening. That's right.</i>

01:33:35.875 --> 01:33:38.416
<i>The </i> Dolemite <i>movie. It's like Christmas,</i>

01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:41.375
except your daddy ain't drunk,
and your mama ain't cryin'.

01:34:07.166 --> 01:34:08.166
Can I help you?

01:34:08.250 --> 01:34:09.791
One ticket for <i>Dolemite.</i>

01:34:11.166 --> 01:34:12.083
Come on, bro.

01:34:12.166 --> 01:34:15.333
Okay, okay. Let me get six tickets.

01:34:15.416 --> 01:34:17.791
Tired of paying
for y'all broke asses, man.

01:34:17.875 --> 01:34:19.625
And here's your change.

01:34:22.166 --> 01:34:24.500
Okay, let's see...

01:34:40.333 --> 01:34:41.333
Huh.

01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:44.416
You about to make a whole lot of green.

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:48.208
Man, you about to sell
all your popcorn, nigga.

01:34:53.958 --> 01:34:55.791
<i>My women is right on time.</i>

01:34:55.875 --> 01:34:59.208
<i>You've been gone for so long.
Got a lot of warming up to do.</i>

01:34:59.291 --> 01:35:02.291
<i>- No shit, baby.
- I can dig it.</i>

01:35:02.375 --> 01:35:04.583
<i>Look at the shit they gave me
to get out of prison, man.</i>

01:35:04.666 --> 01:35:06.708
<i>Glad y'all brought my clothes.</i>

01:35:06.791 --> 01:35:09.671
<i>You bring me fucking cotton drawers.
I don't wear fucking cotton drawers.</i>

01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:11.958
Yeah.

01:35:12.041 --> 01:35:15.125
<i>Quick! Burn some rubber
'cause we gonna deal with this prick.</i>

01:35:15.208 --> 01:35:17.000
<i>Drive, nigga, drive!</i>

01:35:18.041 --> 01:35:20.041
<i>Drive, nigga, drive!</i>

01:35:22.666 --> 01:35:26.666
<i>I've been wantin' to see me

Rudy.

01:35:37.666 --> 01:35:42.333
I'm a little confused.
Now, is this movie supposed to be funny?

01:35:42.416 --> 01:35:44.916
I was expecting a <i>Shaft </i> kind of a thing.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.541
Of course it's supposed to be funny.
They get it. That's why they're laughin'.

01:35:48.625 --> 01:35:51.333
It's a comedy
and it's sexy and it's action.

01:35:51.416 --> 01:35:53.375
It's a total entertainment experience.

01:35:54.041 --> 01:35:55.458
<i>He made me do it!</i>

01:35:55.541 --> 01:35:57.291

the mad genius who four-walled
the Uptown in Indianapolis,

01:37:11.541 --> 01:37:13.416
- set a new house record?
<i>- Hey, man, hurry up.</i>

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.250

01:37:15.333 --> 01:37:16.625
- What's going on?
<i>- Hang on.</i>

01:37:16.708 --> 01:37:19.916
You know how hard it was for me
to find this number? Is this your office?

01:37:21.583 --> 01:37:22.625
Yeah, this my office.

01:37:22.708 --> 01:37:24.833
<i>Well, I'm delighted
to finally speak with you.</i>

01:37:24.916 --> 01:37:28.541
My name is Lawrence Woolner,
and I run Dimension Pictures.

01:37:28.625 --> 01:37:30.250
<i>Dimension Pictures?</i>

01:37:30.333 --> 01:37:32.813
Ain't y'all the rat soup-eating
motherfuckers that rejected me?

01:37:32.875 --> 01:37:36.125
Uh, that's right. That's right.
We did, but, uh, well...

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:41.708
Hollywood is a fickle mistress,
and we got a pitch for you that I...

01:37:41.791 --> 01:37:44.166
I think is gonna knock you
out of your seat.

01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:48.375
Dimension Pictures International
would like to buy <i>Dolemite.</i>

01:37:50.041 --> 01:37:51.416
What?

01:38:10.541 --> 01:38:11.958
Yeah, we got appointment.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.041
Hey, so, what we supposed to say?

01:38:18.125 --> 01:38:21.083
Nothing. Nobody say a fucking word.
Just keep your mouths shut.

01:38:21.166 --> 01:38:24.086
Only reason you're here is to make me
look like a legitimate organization.

01:38:25.333 --> 01:38:28.375
You got hot sauce on your shirt.
Man, clean that shit off, nigga.

01:38:28.458 --> 01:38:30.958
- Come on, get the shit together.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:32.791
It's cool.

01:38:36.458 --> 01:38:40.375
Gentlemen, ma'am,
we're thrilled to have you here.

01:38:40.458 --> 01:38:42.708
I've brought the whole
Dimension Films team.

01:38:42.791 --> 01:38:46.041
Yes, and these are my esteemed colleagues
from Generation International.

01:38:46.125 --> 01:38:50.375
This is Miss Reed, Mr. Taylor,
Mr. Toney, and Mr. Lynch.

01:38:50.458 --> 01:38:51.541
Pleasure.

01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:55.625
Uh, sorry, I'm confused.
What is Generation International?

01:38:55.708 --> 01:38:58.708
I thought you said your production company
was Comedian International.

01:38:58.791 --> 01:39:02.625
Comedian International is
a subsidiary of Generation International.

01:39:02.708 --> 01:39:05.625
Comedian International handles
my live bookings and audio recordings,

01:39:05.708 --> 01:39:06.541
things like that.

01:39:06.625 --> 01:39:10.958
Generation International,
they handle my cinematic output.

01:39:11.916 --> 01:39:15.625
Okay, well...
We're here to talk about your movie.

01:39:15.708 --> 01:39:18.041
We think
there's a golden opportunity here.

01:39:18.125 --> 01:39:21.625
Look, one thing you need to explain to me
is why for come I need you?

01:39:21.708 --> 01:39:25.500
'Cause far as I can see, man,
I'm doing pretty fuckin' good by myself.

01:39:25.583 --> 01:39:27.375
Well, now, Rudy,

01:39:27.458 --> 01:39:30.916
there's a certain professional way
to go about distributing a film.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.333
We all know that there's a history
of niggas making some art,

01:39:34.416 --> 01:39:37.291
and the white man come along
and steal all the money.

01:39:37.375 --> 01:39:39.541
And y'all sure in the fuck
ain't finna do to me

01:39:39.625 --> 01:39:41.875
what they did to Chuck Berry, huh? Hmm?

01:39:41.958 --> 01:39:42.958
You know what?

01:39:43.875 --> 01:39:47.333
You wanna do it your way,
you go right ahead.

01:39:47.416 --> 01:39:52.125
You go out there, you introduce your movie
into every theater in the country.

01:39:52.208 --> 01:39:53.368
You know, knock yourself out.

01:39:53.416 --> 01:39:57.333
You're gonna be releasing <i>Dolemite</i>
for the next five years.

01:39:57.416 --> 01:40:00.875
But if you wanna do it right,
well, here we are.

01:40:00.958 --> 01:40:06.125
You know, hey...
Now, we've passed once, so...

01:40:07.125 --> 01:40:08.125
we fucked up.

01:40:08.208 --> 01:40:10.416
- Damn right, you fucked up.
- You knock it down.

01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:12.375
That's the understatement of the year.

01:40:12.458 --> 01:40:14.833
But allow us now to sell ourselves to you.

01:40:14.916 --> 01:40:18.958
Dimension International...
we have two sweet spots.

01:40:19.041 --> 01:40:20.500
Redneck pictures.

01:40:20.583 --> 01:40:21.958
Right? Those are hillbillies

01:40:22.041 --> 01:40:25.416
and moonshine and sheriffs,
and those play at the Southern drive-ins.

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:30.791
Now, the second sweet spot
is blaxploitation films.

01:40:30.875 --> 01:40:35.208
It's films about blacks and for blacks.
And you know where they play?

01:40:35.291 --> 01:40:39.958
They play in
the big beautiful movie showcases.

01:40:40.041 --> 01:40:41.750
And every downtown has 'em.

01:40:41.833 --> 01:40:47.125
They were built in the 1920s.
They seat 2,000, 3,000 people.

01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:48.500
They used to be very popular,

01:40:48.583 --> 01:40:51.458
but then the white audience,
you know, skedaddled out to the suburbs.

01:40:51.541 --> 01:40:54.666
And what's left?
Well, the black urban audience.

01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:55.875
Now, I'll tell you what.

01:40:55.958 --> 01:40:59.583
If we book the right films,
your film, these...

01:41:00.166 --> 01:41:05.291
well, there is no other word for it,
but resplendent movie palaces,

01:41:05.375 --> 01:41:08.208
well, I think we can make a killing.

01:41:10.458 --> 01:41:11.541
You know...

01:41:12.625 --> 01:41:14.166
in my new movie, there's a scene

01:41:14.250 --> 01:41:18.500
where big bad Willie Green
comes back to town, and my club is stolen.

01:41:18.583 --> 01:41:20.875
Takes all my receipts
and all my cash and all the girls.

01:41:20.958 --> 01:41:23.083
Everything I been building up
my whole life.

01:41:23.166 --> 01:41:26.583
He comes along, tries to take possession
'cause he think I don't know no better.

01:41:27.708 --> 01:41:29.583
But that's when I start to take charge...

01:41:31.208 --> 01:41:34.083
and I start showing motherfuckers
who's boss.

01:41:34.166 --> 01:41:37.333
'Cause Dolemite ain't getting ripped off.

01:41:37.416 --> 01:41:38.458
Can you dig it?

01:41:39.916 --> 01:41:41.666
You gonna rip my guts out now?

01:41:44.625 --> 01:41:46.500
We'll talk
after the first profit statement.

01:41:47.333 --> 01:41:48.875
All right!

01:41:50.458 --> 01:41:51.375
All right now.

01:41:51.458 --> 01:41:53.041
We gonna be on Dimension Films.

01:41:53.125 --> 01:41:55.583
<i>Dolemite's</i> gonna be on Dimension Films.

01:41:56.375 --> 01:41:59.833
Opening this Friday at the Avon Theater!

01:42:00.416 --> 01:42:03.833
Opening this Friday night
at the Moonlight Drive-In!

01:42:03.916 --> 01:42:06.416
Opening Friday night at the Cameo!

01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:12.458
Get him on the fucking phone,
and this time, you talk to him.

01:42:12.541 --> 01:42:14.833
You're not gonna believe who paid us back.

01:42:20.291 --> 01:42:25.875
Yes, I put my finger in the ground
and turned the whole world upside down!

01:42:25.958 --> 01:42:26.958
Dolemite!

01:42:27.875 --> 01:42:30.333

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.166
Hey, Rudy.

01:43:05.541 --> 01:43:09.458
Baby, we have come a long way
from that club and that cow pasture.

01:43:09.541 --> 01:43:12.500
Oh, yes, mama, we have. Yes, we have.

01:43:15.791 --> 01:43:17.291
Oh, oh, Rudy, um...

01:43:18.166 --> 01:43:19.875
I wanted to tell you something.

01:43:20.708 --> 01:43:21.875
Uh...

01:43:21.958 --> 01:43:25.166
I just wanted to say
that I'm so grateful.

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:30.583
I'm so grateful
for you putting me in this movie,

01:43:30.666 --> 01:43:34.291
'cause I ain't never seen nobody
that looks like me...

01:43:35.458 --> 01:43:37.291
up there on that big screen.

01:43:39.250 --> 01:43:41.916
You know what I'm saying? Oh, shit.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.083
I may not be sexy, but I'm a real woman...

01:43:46.958 --> 01:43:49.916
and I really appreciate
what you did for me.

01:43:50.791 --> 01:43:51.958

That's what I'm talking about.

01:44:17.333 --> 01:44:18.750
Hey, hey, I found a review.

01:44:18.833 --> 01:44:19.958
What's that say?

01:44:23.625 --> 01:44:25.208
Go ahead, man. Just spit it out.

01:44:26.375 --> 01:44:27.708
Go on, say what is it.

01:44:29.708 --> 01:44:33.000
"Dull-emite is a more apt title."

01:44:34.541 --> 01:44:36.875
What'd you say?
What'd you just say? "Dull" or "Dol"?

01:44:36.958 --> 01:44:38.375
- Dull.
- Oh, really?

01:44:38.458 --> 01:44:41.166
Dull-emite. Dull-emite.

01:44:42.125 --> 01:44:43.375
Um...

01:44:43.458 --> 01:44:46.250
"This could be
the lamest film of the year.

01:44:46.333 --> 01:44:50.208
The plot is vague,
and the actors scream their lines.

01:44:51.375 --> 01:44:55.250
Its only touch of originality
is in the introduction of...

01:44:55.333 --> 01:44:57.416
the fat man as romantic hero."

01:45:03.833 --> 01:45:06.208
- What's wrong with being portly?
- Not a damn thing.

01:45:06.291 --> 01:45:09.011
I don't see nothing wrong with adding
a few extra pounds, personally.

01:45:09.083 --> 01:45:10.809
- Exactly. Ain't nothing wrong...
- Fuck them.

01:45:10.833 --> 01:45:12.553
- ...with being a little heavyset.
- Mm-hmm.

01:45:12.625 --> 01:45:15.750
That's just one review.
What's yours say there, Jerry?

01:45:15.833 --> 01:45:17.291
Um...

01:45:18.833 --> 01:45:24.791
<i>"Dolemite</i> is dreadful, humorless,
and a technically terrible movie."

01:45:24.875 --> 01:45:27.625
Fuck that, Jerry, man.
Critics don't know nothing.

01:45:27.708 --> 01:45:29.833
I don't even know
why they come in the first place.

01:45:29.916 --> 01:45:32.583
They don't even like to have fun.
Nobody care what the critics say.

01:45:32.666 --> 01:45:34.986
And besides, everybody know
when the brothers go to movies,

01:45:35.041 --> 01:45:38.500
they wanna see car crashes,
explosions, and titties.

01:45:38.583 --> 01:45:40.708
- And we've delivered that.
- Sho' did.

01:45:40.791 --> 01:45:42.708
Look at this one right here.
This is perfect.

01:45:42.791 --> 01:45:47.000
<i>"Dolemite</i> isn't fit
for a blind dog to see.

01:45:47.083 --> 01:45:52.666
It is coarse, rude, crude,

01:45:53.291 --> 01:45:56.166
"Perfect"? But why in the world
do you like that one?

01:45:56.250 --> 01:45:58.041
That's gonna make people say,
"I'm going."

01:45:58.125 --> 01:46:01.833
They gonna wanna see just how coarse,
rude, crude, and vulgar <i>Dolemite</i> is.

01:46:02.916 --> 01:46:03.916
I'll be damned.

01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:38.666
Hey, don't nobody worry about nothing.

01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:41.541
No matter what happens,
tonight is a victory already,

01:46:41.625 --> 01:46:43.666
even if don't but five people show up.

01:46:44.375 --> 01:46:46.083
Look how far we came.

01:46:46.166 --> 01:46:50.375
We riding in a limousine on opening night
to see our movie that we made.

01:46:51.291 --> 01:46:54.208
I'm proud of myself. Y'all should
all be proud of y'all selves, too,

01:46:54.291 --> 01:46:56.531
'cause I'm proud of y'all, we family,
and we did a movie.

01:46:56.583 --> 01:46:58.333
- We going to see our movie.
- That's right.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.333
We gotta make a promise
to ourselves.

01:47:01.416 --> 01:47:03.208
- No matter what happens...
- Mm-hmm.

01:47:03.291 --> 01:47:04.583
...we have a great time.

01:47:05.875 --> 01:47:06.875
Hmm?

01:47:06.958 --> 01:47:08.718
- Yeah, you're right.
- Agreed.

01:47:08.791 --> 01:47:09.833
- Okay.
- All right.

01:47:09.916 --> 01:47:11.291
- Yeah, Rudy.
- Thank you, Rudy.

01:47:11.375 --> 01:47:13.291
- You're already a winner.
- We winners.

01:47:13.375 --> 01:47:15.041
- That's right, we're winners.
- Yeah.

01:47:15.125 --> 01:47:17.583
I feel good.

01:47:18.541 --> 01:47:21.208
- What happened? What's going on?
- Sweet Jesus.

01:47:21.291 --> 01:47:23.166
- What happened?
- Rudy! Rudy, look!

01:47:23.250 --> 01:47:24.291
What's going on?

01:47:25.041 --> 01:47:26.833
Hey, let down the window, man!

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.416
Holy fuck.

01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:34.375
Rudy, look at all these people.

01:47:35.833 --> 01:47:36.958
Oh, my God.

01:47:45.708 --> 01:47:48.375
- Well done, everybody. Well done, Rudy.
- That is some crowd.

01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:34.166
Mr. Moore? Mr. Moore.
It's an honor to have you here.

01:48:34.250 --> 01:48:37.291
But we need to move you inside!
We're not equipped for this kind of crowd!

01:48:37.375 --> 01:48:39.833
It's crazy. So if we could
just get you to move inside!

01:48:39.916 --> 01:48:41.291
The four chairs to the right.

01:48:46.708 --> 01:48:51.125
Rudy. Rudy. I am your biggest fan.
I know. I have all your albums.

01:48:51.208 --> 01:48:52.500
- Rudy.
- This is crazy.

01:48:53.416 --> 01:48:56.416
All right, let's all keep walking.
We have to get started.

01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:58.916
We already sold out the 10 p.m.
and the midnight.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.041
And I think we have to add 2 a.m.
just to make everybody happy.

01:49:02.125 --> 01:49:03.833
These people are gonna be here
till 2 a.m.?

01:49:03.916 --> 01:49:06.125
Oh, yes, sir. Your seat's down front.

01:49:06.208 --> 01:49:08.666
Rudy, man. We gonna miss
the opening credits. Come on now.

01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:10.125
Come on, man. My song.

01:49:10.208 --> 01:49:11.291
Give me a minute.

01:49:21.666 --> 01:49:22.666
Autograph?

01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:25.583
- I wanna see the movie.
- I don't know if we can see the movie...

01:49:25.666 --> 01:49:28.625
Say, little man! You sure you old enough
to be up this late at night?

01:49:28.708 --> 01:49:30.791
Oh, he just won't stop talkin' about you.

01:49:30.875 --> 01:49:35.166
- He always doin' your shit.
- I love your rhymin', Rudy. It's so bad.

01:49:35.250 --> 01:49:36.958
No, you the one's that bad.

01:49:37.041 --> 01:49:40.458
I do your rhymin', just like Dolemite.
But then I make it about me.

01:49:40.541 --> 01:49:42.708
Oh, really? Let me hear what you got, boy.

01:49:43.666 --> 01:49:45.791
You heard about Dolemite
and the Titanic.

01:49:45.875 --> 01:49:48.666
There's a new kid around
finna be gi-gan-tic.

01:49:48.750 --> 01:49:52.125
Young boy,
who in the hell do you think you are

01:49:52.208 --> 01:49:54.625
trying to topple
the world's greatest star?

01:49:54.708 --> 01:49:56.833
I use a earthquake to make a milkshake.

01:49:56.916 --> 01:49:58.666
- Hey, that's my line.
- I know more.

01:49:58.750 --> 01:50:01.250
Mighty Donald is my name, and...

01:50:01.333 --> 01:50:04.208
Fuckin' up motherfuckers is my game.

01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:07.458
Boy, you got the gift.

01:50:07.541 --> 01:50:10.181
Don't never let nobody tell you
you can't be anything you wanna be.

01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:11.250
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

01:50:11.291 --> 01:50:13.250
Rudy, come on.
The film 'bout to start.

01:50:13.333 --> 01:50:16.625
Hey, Lady Reed. Why don't you go on
and watch the movie? I seen it already.

01:50:16.708 --> 01:50:19.184
These people gonna be out here
till two o'clock in the morning,

01:50:19.208 --> 01:50:21.000
and they came to see Dolemite, so...

01:50:22.625 --> 01:50:23.916
I'm gonna give 'em Dolemite.

01:50:25.583 --> 01:50:26.833
- All right?
- All right.

01:50:26.916 --> 01:50:27.750
Okay.

01:50:32.541 --> 01:50:33.958
Wow.

01:50:38.250 --> 01:50:39.666
Right on.

01:50:53.041 --> 01:50:55.125
Hello, you motherfuckers!

01:50:56.875 --> 01:50:59.333
- We love you, Rudy!
- Yes, ladies and gentlemen.

01:50:59.416 --> 01:51:02.958
I just wanna say it's a pleasure
to have y'all come out here tonight,

01:51:03.041 --> 01:51:05.625
but I'm sorry to tell you,
it's gonna be a bit of a wait!

01:51:07.250 --> 01:51:09.541
But don't worry. Don't nobody leave,

01:51:09.625 --> 01:51:11.500
'cause I promise you
it's gonna be worth it!

01:51:14.041 --> 01:51:17.041
'Cause like I always say,
Dolemite is my name,

01:51:17.125 --> 01:51:19.083
and rappin' and tappin' is my game.

01:51:19.916 --> 01:51:24.041
Yes, I'm young and free
and just as bad as I wanna be.

01:51:25.250 --> 01:51:26.125
Take a look at me.

01:51:26.208 --> 01:51:28.875
I'm a rare specimen of a man,
don't you agree?

01:51:30.125 --> 01:51:34.500
I want you to live the life that you love
and love the life that you live.

01:51:34.583 --> 01:51:37.791
From the frantic Atlantic
to the terrific Pacific,

01:51:37.875 --> 01:51:40.166
be the best of whatever you are.

01:51:40.250 --> 01:51:44.750
Shoot for the moon, and if you miss it,
cling on to a motherfucking star.

01:52:02.791 --> 01:52:03.791
Dance!

01:52:05.083 --> 01:52:06.083
Dance!

01:52:06.583 --> 01:52:08.250
You should be very proud of her.

01:52:08.333 --> 01:52:11.583
For damn near two years,
she's been bugging me about doing this.

01:52:12.375 --> 01:52:13.625
Drive, nigga, drive!

01:52:18.666 --> 01:52:20.000
Stop you.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.708
I'm gonna let 'em know

01:52:24.791 --> 01:52:29.250
that Dolemite is my name,
and fucking up motherfuckers is my name.

01:52:47.583 --> 01:52:49.541
