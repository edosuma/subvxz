00:34.083 --> 00:37.542
DREW MICHAEL:
It's nice to see you people.

00:37.626 --> 00:41.626
I have a hard time
with people, so here we go.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.334
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

00:43.417 --> 00:45.834
Well, it's always been hard
for me to connect with people

00:45.918 --> 00:47.125
throughout my whole life,

00:47.209 --> 00:49.000
and I think there's, you know,
a lot of reasons for that.

00:49.083 --> 00:53.250
Um, I have a hearing loss
that I've had since I was a kid.

00:53.334 --> 00:54.959
When I was three years old...

00:55.959 --> 00:57.542
I failed a hearing test.

00:57.626 --> 01:00.918
I took a hearing test
and the doctor said,

01:01.000 --> 01:04.792
"You failed the hearing test."

01:04.876 --> 01:07.667
Well, I didn't know
what he said, but...

01:07.751 --> 01:10.083
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

01:10.167 --> 01:12.584
...he said something,
and my parents got upset,

01:12.667 --> 01:15.000
so I assumed
I didn't nail it, and...

01:17.000 --> 01:18.209
So he told my parents,
he said,

01:18.292 --> 01:19.500
"This kid needs hearing aids."

01:19.584 --> 01:23.500
And so instead of doing that,
they didn't. So we just...

01:23.584 --> 01:25.417
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

01:26.209 --> 01:27.500
...coasted until I was 21.

01:27.584 --> 01:28.834
I didn't wear them
till I was 21.

01:28.918 --> 01:31.000
I wore them for like a week
when I was in fifth grade,

01:31.083 --> 01:33.000
but then this girl I had
a crush on asked about them.

01:33.083 --> 01:34.292
She's like,
"What's in your ear?"

01:34.375 --> 01:36.250
I was like, "Well, that's
the end of that forever."

01:36.334 --> 01:39.417
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

01:39.500 --> 01:41.876
"So I'll figure...
I'll figure it out."

01:44.834 --> 01:47.375
It instilled this kinda sense
of shame in me.

01:47.459 --> 01:49.626
You know, I took it
as something was wrong with me.

01:49.709 --> 01:52.709
I put it on myself.
I go, "I must be fucked up."

01:52.792 --> 01:54.709
And then I'm like,
"No, my doctor fucked up."

01:54.792 --> 01:56.626
And then my friends were like,
"No, dude, your parents,

01:56.709 --> 01:59.834
your parents fucked up."

01:59.918 --> 02:02.792
And it's like, "Oh, cool,
well, add it to their tab."

02:02.876 --> 02:04.542
-Like, I don't know...
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

02:04.626 --> 02:06.292
They got a long tab running,
you know.

02:06.375 --> 02:08.125
Also, they got divorced
when I was 12,

02:08.209 --> 02:09.876
which is, like,
the most "fuck you" age

02:09.959 --> 02:11.334
-you could possibly...
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

02:11.417 --> 02:13.709
Like, you guys weren't, like,
killing it when I was five.

02:13.792 --> 02:17.042
You couldn't have done it then?
You had to wait until I was 12?

02:17.125 --> 02:18.417
They did do the thing
where they--

02:18.500 --> 02:19.959
This is a common thing
I think parents do

02:20.042 --> 02:21.584
when they get divorced,
they tell their kids--

02:21.667 --> 02:23.626
They told me,
"It's not your fault.

02:23.709 --> 02:24.918
Don't worry,
it's not your fault."

02:25.000 --> 02:27.542
It's like, "Yeah, first of all,
I wasn't thinking that.

02:27.626 --> 02:28.834
Uh...

02:28.918 --> 02:31.292
I don't know why you thought
I thought it was on me.

02:31.375 --> 02:32.751
Have you seen you guys?

02:32.834 --> 02:34.334
Mom is cripplingly insecure,

02:34.417 --> 02:35.959
and Dad's addicted
to prostitutes.

02:36.042 --> 02:39.417
On what fucking world
is this on me?"

02:39.500 --> 02:41.792
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

02:43.083 --> 02:45.417
I didn't have a good
blueprint...

02:45.500 --> 02:47.167
for what a relationship
should look like,

02:47.250 --> 02:49.959
so, you know,
I've struggled accordingly.

02:50.042 --> 02:51.667
I've had issues
in relationships.

02:51.751 --> 02:53.667
There's other reasons
for that, too.

02:53.751 --> 02:56.500
Like it can't be a good thing...
(CHUCKLES)

02:56.584 --> 02:59.667
It can't be a good thing
that the first...

03:00.876 --> 03:02.083
2,000...

03:03.167 --> 03:05.167
sexual experiences of my life...

03:05.250 --> 03:07.584
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

03:07.667 --> 03:11.209
...were with a Dell computer.
Like that can't be...

03:11.292 --> 03:13.083
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

03:13.167 --> 03:14.792
It can't be helping.

03:14.876 --> 03:16.584
It can't be pushing me
in the right direction

03:16.667 --> 03:19.042
on this pursuit of love
and happiness that I'm on.

03:19.125 --> 03:21.042
Two thousand.
That's the number, by the way.

03:21.125 --> 03:22.959
I didn't, like, write down
a funny number for you.

03:23.042 --> 03:24.834
-I counted.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

03:24.918 --> 03:27.584
It's literally 2,000,
age 12 to 19

03:27.667 --> 03:30.626
was exclusively
that every single day.

03:30.709 --> 03:32.500
I bought a computer
for my family

03:32.584 --> 03:33.626
with my bar mitzvah money,

03:33.709 --> 03:35.959
and then I fucked it
for seven years straight.

03:36.042 --> 03:38.709
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

03:38.792 --> 03:39.918
That's how I began.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.500
That is the origin story
to my sexual identity,

03:42.584 --> 03:45.834
just downloading sexist shit
into my head.

03:45.918 --> 03:47.542
Then waltzing out
into the world like,

03:47.626 --> 03:49.459
"Oh, yeah,
I totally respect people."

03:49.542 --> 03:51.584
How? How is that even possible?

03:51.667 --> 03:55.167
It's so corrosive.
That shit will rot your brain.

03:55.250 --> 03:57.667
And it's certainly,
for a young boy,

03:57.751 --> 04:00.751
like, it's insane.
Even now, it's like...

04:00.834 --> 04:02.417
We like to pretend
like it's fine,

04:02.500 --> 04:04.751
but that's only because
we don't have to acknowledge

04:04.834 --> 04:06.125
what it is that we're doing.

04:06.209 --> 04:09.334
It's like this virtual,
wordless escapade.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.792
You never have to be accountable
for what it is you're doing.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.375
I think before...

04:14.375 --> 04:18.167
you're allowed
to click on a video...

04:18.250 --> 04:21.417
you should have to say
the title out loud.

04:21.500 --> 04:25.042
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

04:29.209 --> 04:31.417
How badly do you want this?

04:31.500 --> 04:32.709
I feel like
most people are like,

04:32.792 --> 04:34.834
"I'm just gonna call my mom
and reconnect...

04:36.375 --> 04:39.375
-the person I need to be."
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

04:41.542 --> 04:44.125
And it's bled in.
Yeah, my relationship dynamics

04:44.209 --> 04:46.626
have always been
somewhat turbulent.

04:46.709 --> 04:47.792
A lot of back and forth,

04:47.876 --> 04:49.918
break up, get back together
kind of things.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.626
A lot of things
that start really quickly.

04:51.709 --> 04:54.000
It's like immediate intensity,

04:54.083 --> 04:56.209
you know? Because usually
I feel like shit about myself

04:56.292 --> 04:57.709
and they feel like shit
about themselves,

04:57.792 --> 04:58.959
and we come together
and we're like,

04:59.042 --> 05:00.042
"Well, we have each other.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.209
And we can do all this stuff!

05:01.292 --> 05:02.542
We can do
all this stuff together

05:02.626 --> 05:03.834
now that we're both here.

05:03.918 --> 05:07.834
We can rub each other's heads.
We can take naps together.

05:07.918 --> 05:09.417
We can, like, slow dance
in the kitchen

05:09.500 --> 05:10.709
while we're waiting
for our cookies

05:10.792 --> 05:13.000
to finish baking." How specific
do you want me to get?

05:13.083 --> 05:15.500
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

05:15.584 --> 05:16.959
But then
when I have all that stuff,

05:17.042 --> 05:18.125
I'm able to see, I'm like,

05:18.209 --> 05:19.876
"Oh, this is a very
codependent relationship,

05:19.959 --> 05:21.042
this isn't healthy.

05:21.125 --> 05:22.834
This isn't the kind of thing
I wanna be in long term.

05:22.918 --> 05:24.667
You're not the person
that's right for me."

05:24.751 --> 05:26.209
So I'll be like,
"Maybe we should break up."

05:26.292 --> 05:29.459
But then they leave,
they take all the stuff!

05:29.542 --> 05:31.667
I'm like,
"I wanna break up with you,

05:31.751 --> 05:33.459
but you should love me still.

05:33.542 --> 05:36.209
Like, you should still
give me all the things,

05:36.292 --> 05:37.667
just don't ask me for anything."

05:37.751 --> 05:39.417
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
-Like, "I need you.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.584
Like, this is all built off
of the back of you.

05:41.667 --> 05:44.375
Like, your love for me
gave me the confidence

05:44.459 --> 05:46.667
to even feel like
I could break up with you."

05:46.751 --> 05:49.167
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

05:50.792 --> 05:54.000
"I never would've broken up
with you if I was by myself."

05:54.083 --> 05:56.626
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

05:59.626 --> 06:01.500
But it's a self-esteem thing.
I don't feel--

06:01.584 --> 06:04.626
I don't feel, like, good enough
for the person that I...

06:04.709 --> 06:07.292
that would be right for me,
you know?

06:07.375 --> 06:09.000
So, what if--
I play this in my head.

06:09.083 --> 06:13.959
What it feels like I need to do
is I need to find a girlfriend,

06:14.042 --> 06:17.250
uh, in order to be
confident enough

06:17.334 --> 06:21.292
to be the type of person
that I would need to be

06:21.375 --> 06:26.751
in order to attract the girl
that I actually want to be with.

06:26.834 --> 06:28.792
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

06:31.751 --> 06:32.751
On my own, I'm nothing,

06:32.834 --> 06:34.709
but in a relationship,
I'm kind of a catch.

06:34.792 --> 06:37.459
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

06:39.417 --> 06:40.584
(CHUCKLES)

06:43.876 --> 06:45.167
I feel like
this is a common phenomenon,

06:45.250 --> 06:48.167
that love at first sight,
that idea, it gets propagated.

06:48.250 --> 06:50.918
We all know what you mean by it,
"love at first sight."

06:51.000 --> 06:53.876
And it's something
that's a really enchanting idea,

06:53.959 --> 06:55.500
you know? 'Cause you're like,

06:55.584 --> 06:57.375
you know,
one minute you're alone,

06:57.459 --> 06:58.792
the next minute
you've found the one.

06:58.876 --> 07:01.167
It's like, "What a...
What a day." (CHUCKLES)

07:01.250 --> 07:04.667
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
-What a day that would be.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.500
And so it's so enticing,
but I've seen--

07:08.584 --> 07:10.417
I've gone
that route so many times,

07:10.500 --> 07:12.334
I know what's
on the back end of it,

07:12.417 --> 07:14.417
so it's hard for me
not to be cynical about it.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.959
Now when I hear people like,
"We knew right away..."

07:17.626 --> 07:19.459
Did you?

07:19.542 --> 07:20.959
'Cause now anytime I hear
someone say

07:21.042 --> 07:22.209
about their own relationship,

07:22.292 --> 07:24.083
"We knew right away,"
all I hear is,

07:24.167 --> 07:26.167
"We were
both abandoned as children."

07:26.250 --> 07:28.250
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

07:29.292 --> 07:30.792
You knew right away?
Your threshold

07:30.876 --> 07:32.709
for loving a person
is you saw them once?

07:32.792 --> 07:35.167
That seems like a low bar
to clear.

07:35.250 --> 07:36.542
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

07:36.626 --> 07:38.083
I feel like maybe
you can't handle

07:38.167 --> 07:39.542
the anxiety of uncertainty,

07:39.626 --> 07:41.709
so you went from zero
to 100 right away

07:41.792 --> 07:43.667
to skip over
that prospect of rejection

07:43.751 --> 07:45.250
and the risk
that they might not be

07:45.334 --> 07:47.209
who you imagine them to be.
Am I close?

07:47.292 --> 07:48.375
Am I fucking close?

07:48.459 --> 07:50.334
-Like, I feel like that...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

07:50.417 --> 07:51.876
...is a more accurate
characterization

07:51.959 --> 07:53.000
of what we're talking about.

07:53.083 --> 07:54.876
If you're drawn to somebody
that quickly,

07:54.959 --> 07:57.792
that strongly, that intensely,
that immediately,

07:57.876 --> 07:59.167
that's not love.

07:59.250 --> 08:01.459
You probably have
unresolved trauma.

08:01.542 --> 08:03.292
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

08:03.375 --> 08:06.083
And the other person probably
represents an embodiment

08:06.167 --> 08:09.292
of the trigger of that trauma,
so you're drawn to them

08:09.375 --> 08:12.167
in this misguided attempt
to retroactively fix

08:12.250 --> 08:14.334
a fucked-up period in your past.

08:14.417 --> 08:16.626
That's not love!
Don't call that love.

08:16.709 --> 08:18.042
Don't rebrand that as love

08:18.125 --> 08:19.500
and make the rest
of us feel bad.

08:19.584 --> 08:22.125
Don't be out in the world like,
"It was love at first sight."

08:22.209 --> 08:24.876
Say something honest like,
"It was 'I felt the way I did

08:24.959 --> 08:26.876
when my dad left'
at first sight."

08:26.959 --> 08:29.334
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-I'll believe that.

08:31.209 --> 08:32.542
I'll believe that, yeah.

08:32.626 --> 08:34.751
"My husband's face
looks just like the back

08:34.834 --> 08:37.167
of my father's head,
so I chased it..."

08:37.250 --> 08:39.667
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-"...to now."

08:39.751 --> 08:42.375
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

08:43.292 --> 08:45.167
You should not be chasing.
Don't chase.

08:45.918 --> 08:47.500
Love should not be chased.

08:48.042 --> 08:49.709
(GASPS)

08:49.792 --> 08:52.042
You shouldn't have that, like,
"Are we gonna make it?"

08:52.125 --> 08:53.459
(CHUCKLES) No!

08:53.542 --> 08:55.918
( AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

08:56.000 --> 08:58.334
If you're wondering, no.
You should not be chasing.

08:58.417 --> 09:00.667
Like in movies, like,
to propagate this idea,

09:00.751 --> 09:02.459
"chase them,"
and that rom-com fantasy

09:02.542 --> 09:04.542
of chasing someone
to an airport.

09:04.626 --> 09:07.459
Chase a therapist to an airport.
Like, don't...

09:07.542 --> 09:09.459
Like, "Don't leave,
we have so much work to do!"

09:09.542 --> 09:12.334
-Like, that's...
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

09:14.375 --> 09:15.500
(CHUCKLES)

09:15.584 --> 09:17.375
No, 'cause movies have
to show you--

09:17.459 --> 09:19.459
They can't show you
what love actually is.

09:19.542 --> 09:23.042
We don't wanna see it.
Love isn't entertaining.

09:23.125 --> 09:25.584
They have to show some dramatic,
conflicted version of love.

09:25.667 --> 09:26.834
They don't...

09:26.918 --> 09:29.250
We don't wanna see love,
actual love.

09:29.334 --> 09:31.542
It's beautiful. I'm not
shitting on the sentiment.

09:31.626 --> 09:33.584
It's an amazing thing
between the two people.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.167
It's not fun to watch.

09:35.250 --> 09:37.292
Think about a couple you know,
maybe you are that couple,

09:37.375 --> 09:39.751
who are truly in love,
in love, like,

09:40.500 --> 09:43.542
together, good, healthy.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.125
We don't wanna watch that.
Like, if you wanna--

09:47.209 --> 09:48.417
-If you--
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

09:48.500 --> 09:51.334
If you watched a movie
about a couple in love,

09:51.417 --> 09:52.959
you would just be on your couch

09:53.042 --> 09:55.417
watching a couple
on their couch,

09:55.500 --> 09:57.125
watching a better movie.

09:57.209 --> 10:00.542
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

10:03.500 --> 10:04.667
You're like, "Why...

10:04.751 --> 10:06.292
What are they watching?
I'll just watch that.

10:06.375 --> 10:08.083
Why don't we cut out...

10:08.167 --> 10:09.959
cut out the middleman?
I don't need..."

10:10.042 --> 10:12.959
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

10:13.042 --> 10:15.918
-AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, my God.
-That's not what they show you.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
'Cause we don't wanna see--

10:17.083 --> 10:18.959
We don't wanna see healthy,
good love.

10:19.042 --> 10:20.834
We wanna see, like,
a manifestation of, like,

10:20.918 --> 10:23.083
our own internal dramas
played out...

10:23.834 --> 10:25.125
for entertainment value.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.751
The problem is
there are people out there,

10:26.834 --> 10:27.959
like when I was a kid,

10:28.042 --> 10:31.834
who are like empty canvases,
who internalized that.

10:31.918 --> 10:33.584
And so it starts
to skew their view

10:33.667 --> 10:34.709
of what love could be.

10:34.792 --> 10:36.000
Like, people who don't have
a healthy blueprint

10:36.083 --> 10:38.459
are gonna absorb that
and take that in.

10:38.542 --> 10:41.876
You know, I was 12 years old
when the movie Titanic came out,

10:41.959 --> 10:43.334
and that was, like,

10:43.417 --> 10:46.459
iconic love story.
Like, here it is,

10:46.542 --> 10:51.042
epic love,
cruelly interrupted by fate.

10:52.459 --> 10:54.042
And I look at that movie now,
I'm like,

10:54.125 --> 10:56.626
"Wait, what were we rooting
for here?

10:56.709 --> 10:59.834
What did we want to happen?
For them to get to New York?

10:59.918 --> 11:03.000
They weren't gonna
make it as a couple."

11:03.083 --> 11:05.209
What did we think?
They're 20 years old,

11:05.292 --> 11:07.167
they've known
each other two days.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.918
I don't know everything
about relationships,

11:09.000 --> 11:10.250
but like, hey, maybe don't marry

11:10.334 --> 11:12.375
the artist you fucked
on a cruise.

11:12.459 --> 11:16.459
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

11:19.125 --> 11:20.709
Maybe that's not the move.

11:21.834 --> 11:24.209
Five minutes after you tried
to kill yourself.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.542
Do you remember
that's how they met?

11:25.626 --> 11:28.918
She was trying to kill herself
by jumping off the boat,

11:29.000 --> 11:30.459
and he was like,
"Hey, I'm pretty hot.

11:30.542 --> 11:32.292
What if you didn't do that?"
And so...

11:32.375 --> 11:35.500
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

11:35.584 --> 11:37.959
That's how they started.
They knew right away.

11:38.042 --> 11:40.292
Like, that's the thing,
is like, what happens?

11:40.375 --> 11:41.375
How is that gonna play out?

11:41.459 --> 11:43.083
Even if they get
to New York, what?

11:44.584 --> 11:47.500
-They have nothing in common.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

11:47.584 --> 11:49.125
You know what I mean?
Like, all they have is

11:49.209 --> 11:51.167
the excitement
that they made it.

11:51.250 --> 11:53.584
That lasts, what?
Six months, a year...

11:54.292 --> 11:56.500
two years, maybe?

11:56.584 --> 11:59.250
What happens five, ten years
down the road?

11:59.334 --> 12:01.459
Just sittin' there.
He's like, "So...

12:03.042 --> 12:05.542
you want me to draw you?"
She's like, "Fuck you!"

12:05.626 --> 12:07.876
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

12:09.876 --> 12:12.167
"I was engaged
to a billionaire.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.417
I had to sell that necklace
to pay the heating bill.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.334
You haven't sold a sketch
in years, Jack.

12:17.417 --> 12:19.959
How's that art gallery going,
Jack?"

12:23.167 --> 12:25.083
He's like, "Oh, come on.
Remember when we danced

12:25.167 --> 12:28.417
-with the common folk?"
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

12:28.500 --> 12:30.667
Terrible.
It would've been terrible.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.626
People are like,
"Oh, it's so sad what happened.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.167
If they
didn't hit the iceberg..."

12:35.250 --> 12:38.334
Fuck that! The iceberg
is the hero of that movie.

12:38.417 --> 12:40.709
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

12:44.167 --> 12:46.167
It might've killed Jack,
but it saved

12:46.250 --> 12:47.959
the rest of Rose's life.

12:48.042 --> 12:50.250
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

12:54.626 --> 12:56.083
I like movies, I do.

12:57.709 --> 12:59.209
I do.

12:59.292 --> 13:00.876
I don't like
movie culture, though,

13:00.959 --> 13:02.250
like Hollywood...

13:02.334 --> 13:04.292
like the culture surrounding it.
And every time I get roped

13:04.375 --> 13:06.209
into watching an award show,
I'm always reminded,

13:06.292 --> 13:08.542
like, who the fuck
makes these things.

13:08.626 --> 13:10.542
It's like, "Oh, my God."
You ever watch an award show?

13:10.626 --> 13:12.459
It's like this shouldn't be
on television.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.709
This should be, like...

13:16.125 --> 13:18.709
like, in an underground cave
at Bohemian Grove.

13:18.792 --> 13:22.792
Like, why is this
in front of the public?

13:22.876 --> 13:25.792
'Cause they try to act
like they're down-to-earth.

13:25.876 --> 13:28.125
Every time an actor
wins an award,
they always give some--

13:28.209 --> 13:29.667
It's not some, like,
normal speech,

13:29.751 --> 13:32.709
it's like a lofty,
sociopolitical response

13:32.792 --> 13:34.250
to the moment.

13:34.334 --> 13:36.751
It's like,
"We need to find a way.

13:36.834 --> 13:38.375
There's a lot of problems
in the world.

13:38.459 --> 13:41.125
We need to find a way
to come together

13:41.209 --> 13:43.500
and not let it divide us."

13:43.584 --> 13:46.334
Like Meryl Streep,
"We need to come together."

13:46.417 --> 13:49.000
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
-"Find unity and strength,

13:49.083 --> 13:52.751
and break down the barriers
that keep us apart.

13:52.834 --> 13:55.709
-And find strength and unity."
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

13:55.792 --> 14:00.542
"Come together as a globe,
as a nation, as a people."

14:02.584 --> 14:04.417
I'm always like,
"Yeah, uh, you're wearing

14:04.500 --> 14:06.292
a diamond dress from Givenchy."

14:06.375 --> 14:11.083
Like, on what fucking planet
are you part of "the people"?

14:11.167 --> 14:13.584
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
-Like, what do you think?

14:13.667 --> 14:15.751
Like, if there was
a true people's revolution,

14:15.834 --> 14:18.209
like a people's uprising,
it's gonna be your blood

14:18.292 --> 14:21.167
-splattered on the sidewalk.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

14:21.250 --> 14:22.334
They're not gonna spare you

14:22.417 --> 14:24.167
'cause they liked
Devil Wears Prada.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.500
They're gonna rip
your fucking head off,

14:26.584 --> 14:27.876
stick it on a stake,

14:27.959 --> 14:30.792
and sell that diamond dress
to a cartel for machine guns.

14:30.876 --> 14:32.209
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

14:32.292 --> 14:34.209
They're not gonna be like,
"Oh, get in the bunker.

14:34.292 --> 14:37.459
We love the nuance
of your artistic choices.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.792
It was so brave of you,
how you dared,

14:40.876 --> 14:43.709
oh, how you dared to be
a middle-class character."

14:43.792 --> 14:46.500
Like, "Oh, how you pretended
to be a thing

14:46.584 --> 14:49.709
people are their entire lives.
How did you do it?

14:51.459 --> 14:52.918
How did you prepare
for the role?"

14:53.000 --> 14:55.500
And they're always like,
"Oh, I lived amongst plumbers

14:55.584 --> 14:58.250
-for eight months."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

14:59.459 --> 15:02.584
"I lived how they lived.
I ate how they ate."

15:02.667 --> 15:05.292
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

15:05.375 --> 15:08.000
No, that's it, you can't.
You can't preach togetherness

15:08.083 --> 15:11.083
and unity when you're that rich.
You just can't do it.

15:11.167 --> 15:14.209
You're rich. You're super rich.

15:14.834 --> 15:16.417
That's why you got rich,

15:16.500 --> 15:18.709
is to get the fuck away
from everybody.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.834
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

15:22.417 --> 15:23.292
That's what money is.

15:23.375 --> 15:25.709
Money is just an escape
from people.

15:26.542 --> 15:27.709
That's why we want it.

15:28.584 --> 15:29.584
Everything money does for you.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.918
Doesn't even have
to be a lot of money.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.667
You'd be like,
"Ooh, I can afford an Uber."

15:33.751 --> 15:36.500
What's an Uber?
That is a bus for one person.

15:36.584 --> 15:39.792
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

15:41.751 --> 15:43.000
It's like,
"Yeah, I like the bus.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.626
I just wish
there were no people on it

15:44.709 --> 15:46.834
and it only went
where I want it to go."

15:46.918 --> 15:48.959
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

15:52.209 --> 15:54.000
Yeah, you can do that.
You gotta pay for it.

15:55.167 --> 15:56.167
You wanna join a gym,

15:56.250 --> 15:57.417
there's different kinds of gyms,
right?

15:57.500 --> 15:59.334
There's a whole spectrum
of gym options.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.042
There's a ten-dollar-a-month gym
on one end.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.709
Two-hundred-dollar-a-month gym
on the other end.

16:02.792 --> 16:04.042
What's the difference?

16:04.125 --> 16:05.834
Two-hundred-dollar-a-month gym,
it's nicer.

16:05.918 --> 16:07.709
It's not 20 times nicer.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.042
It's not like
the ten-dollar-a-month gym,

16:09.125 --> 16:10.209
the walls are falling off,

16:10.292 --> 16:11.459
and you pick up
the ten-pound weight

16:11.542 --> 16:12.542
and it's 100 pounds.

16:12.626 --> 16:13.918
You're like,
"Oh, fuck this gym!

16:15.083 --> 16:16.834
The dumbbells
are Gatorade bottles

16:16.918 --> 16:18.792
filled with rocks,
this gym sucks."

16:18.876 --> 16:21.709
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

16:23.334 --> 16:24.667
No, there's still
equipment there.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.167
The 200-dollar-a-month gym,
you pay 200 dollars a month

16:27.250 --> 16:28.667
so you don't have to
look at people

16:28.751 --> 16:30.417
who can only afford
ten dollars a month.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.542
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-That's what you're paying for.

16:32.626 --> 16:34.167
You wanna be able
to do a pull-up

16:34.250 --> 16:36.083
without being reminded
of the dark underbelly

16:36.167 --> 16:37.918
-of capitalism.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

16:38.000 --> 16:39.417
It's a 190-dollar surcharge

16:39.500 --> 16:41.918
to not have to make eye contact
with the consolation prize

16:42.042 --> 16:44.375
in this fucked-up game
we're all playing here.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.250
That's what you're paying for.
That's the premium.

16:47.334 --> 16:49.167
Everything money does
for you just pushes you

16:49.250 --> 16:51.792
further and further away
from everybody else.

16:51.876 --> 16:53.667
You wanna fly,
you buy a plane ticket.

16:53.751 --> 16:55.667
First-class ticket,
way more expensive.

16:55.751 --> 16:57.918
Why?
There's less people up there.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.334
They won't tell you that.
They'll be like,

16:59.417 --> 17:01.709
"No, you get more space."
It's like, yeah, motherfucker,

17:01.792 --> 17:04.167
space is just the absence
of people.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.959
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-It's not a new entity.

17:07.042 --> 17:09.500
Space is a euphemism
for not anybody.

17:10.626 --> 17:11.709
"No, you get all this legroom."

17:11.792 --> 17:13.292
Yeah, 'cause they're no people
in the way

17:13.375 --> 17:15.042
of where my legs
are trying to go.

17:15.125 --> 17:16.959
We could all have
legroom back here

17:17.042 --> 17:18.918
if we weren't all back here.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.918
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

17:24.542 --> 17:27.125
Now, could you imagine
if two people in economy class

17:27.209 --> 17:28.876
were, like,
fighting over the armrest,

17:28.959 --> 17:30.792
and some asshole
from first class came back

17:30.876 --> 17:33.792
and was like, "Hey!
We need to all work together.

17:33.876 --> 17:37.459
We need to find
unity and strength as a flight.

17:37.542 --> 17:40.751
We're all flight 348,
after all."

17:40.834 --> 17:42.042
Then they swoosh the curtain

17:42.125 --> 17:44.292
and go back to their
apartment in the sky.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.626
How quickly before the back rows

17:46.709 --> 17:48.959
start bundling their
plastic silverware together

17:49.042 --> 17:50.167
to storm the front?

17:50.250 --> 17:51.459
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

17:51.542 --> 17:53.417
Like, "No, no, we're not trying
to hijack the plane,

17:53.500 --> 17:55.918
we're just trying to kill
rows one through five.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.167
Take their hot towels
and orange juice

17:58.250 --> 17:59.334
and spread it around."

17:59.417 --> 18:01.500
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

18:01.584 --> 18:03.125
That's the fantasy.
Everyone fantasizes

18:03.209 --> 18:04.667
about what they would do
when they get rich.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.292
You wanna get away
from everybody.

18:06.375 --> 18:09.959
Nobody fantasizes
about togetherness.

18:10.042 --> 18:13.250
Nobody's like, "Oh, dude,
if I got rich... (CHUCKLES)

18:13.334 --> 18:16.042
I would get
so many roommates."

18:16.125 --> 18:18.626
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

18:20.292 --> 18:23.375
"Oh, it'd be sick, we'd have
like a dishes schedule."

18:23.459 --> 18:25.792
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

18:25.876 --> 18:28.292
No, the fantasy is,
"I'm gonna build a moat

18:28.375 --> 18:30.125
around my house.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.292
People aren't gonna be able
to ring my doorbell

18:32.375 --> 18:34.876
without swimming across
a crocodile-laden river."

18:34.959 --> 18:37.334
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
-Fuck everybody.

18:38.459 --> 18:40.042
And I got nothing
against rich people.

18:40.125 --> 18:41.375
You just can't have it
both ways.

18:41.459 --> 18:43.542
You can't bridge class
with a speech.

18:44.292 --> 18:45.250
You can't have it all

18:45.334 --> 18:46.626
and then have this, like,
faux empathy.

18:46.709 --> 18:50.125
Like, "Aww... it's so sad,
people don't have any money."

18:50.209 --> 18:51.751
It's like, "Well,
you seem to have it."

18:51.834 --> 18:53.709
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

18:53.792 --> 18:56.000
"Try giving it away.
You don't have to have it."

18:57.876 --> 18:59.542
And these phony causes,
every Thanksgiving,

18:59.626 --> 19:00.918
one of them
comes out with, like,

19:01.000 --> 19:02.792
"It's so terrible what happened
to the Native Americans."

19:02.876 --> 19:05.209
It's like,
"Fucking, I don't know,
give 'em the land back."

19:05.292 --> 19:09.667
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING, CHEERING)

19:09.751 --> 19:12.626
(CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY)

19:12.709 --> 19:13.667
"No."

19:13.751 --> 19:16.167
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-"We can't do that.

19:16.250 --> 19:18.667
Where would we put the offices
of DoorDash?"

19:18.751 --> 19:21.751
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

19:25.083 --> 19:26.459
(CHUCKLES)

19:29.667 --> 19:30.918
I swear to God, these fucking...

19:31.000 --> 19:33.584
Like North America could be,
like, falling into the ocean.

19:33.667 --> 19:34.918
We could all be
killing each other

19:35.000 --> 19:37.209
over grain seeds
and fresh water.

19:37.292 --> 19:39.250
These people would be like
on Mars,

19:39.334 --> 19:42.083
-tweeting, "Stop the violence."
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

19:42.167 --> 19:43.584
"Love is stronger than hate."

19:43.667 --> 19:46.000
And changing their
profile picture to a blue circle

19:46.083 --> 19:47.709
to show they still care
about Earth.

19:47.792 --> 19:50.125
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

19:50.209 --> 19:51.876
Going on Jimmy Fallon
to promote it,

19:51.959 --> 19:53.918
like, "Yeah, we're changing
our profile pictures

19:54.000 --> 19:56.417
to blue circles
to raise Earth awareness."

19:56.500 --> 19:59.375
Jimmy's just like, "Oh, my God,
it's genius. Such a good idea."

19:59.459 --> 20:00.626
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

20:00.709 --> 20:02.626
"Oh, my God, how'd you think
of it? It's so important.

20:02.709 --> 20:03.792
You're doing such
important work."

20:03.876 --> 20:06.375
-(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

20:06.459 --> 20:08.959

(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

20:13.292 --> 20:16.709
Jimmy Fallon. I'm sorry,
is there a more Guy Smiley,

20:16.792 --> 20:19.459
useless,
puppet fuck of a person...

20:19.542 --> 20:22.626
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING, CHEERING)

20:22.709 --> 20:24.542
...than Jimmy Fallon?

20:30.959 --> 20:33.542
(GIGGLES SARCASTICALLY)

20:35.250 --> 20:37.000
Dude, I used to think
Leno said nothing.

20:37.083 --> 20:39.584
Fallon makes Leno look like
Malcolm X.

20:39.667 --> 20:41.792
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

20:44.083 --> 20:46.626
Like, "Oh, yeah."
(BABBLES INCOMPREHENSIBLY)

20:49.000 --> 20:51.042
I'll never get asked
to do the show, but...

20:51.125 --> 20:53.667
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-(CHUCKLES)

20:54.792 --> 20:57.459
I... I would wanna do it
just one time,

20:57.542 --> 21:00.584
just to be like, "Hey, Jimmy,
what do you not like?"

21:00.667 --> 21:03.334
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
-"What-- Is there anything--

21:03.417 --> 21:06.250
Do you have a hard stance
on fucking anything?"

21:06.334 --> 21:08.000
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

21:08.083 --> 21:10.709
He'd be like, "Oh, my God,
it's such a cool take."

21:10.792 --> 21:12.125
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

21:12.209 --> 21:15.042
(GIGGLES) "I don't know, I...
I just kinda float around.

I have no discretion,

I mean less to myself.

I'm murdering my identity
up here."

(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

21:27.500 --> 21:28.834
"It's genius." (LAUGHS)

21:28.918 --> 21:32.375
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Like you could literally--

21:32.459 --> 21:35.125
You could put a gun in his mouth
and...

21:35.209 --> 21:36.209
(MIMICS GUNSHOT)

21:36.292 --> 21:37.959
...blow his head off
and he'd be like,

21:38.042 --> 21:40.792
"Oh, my God, my brains are
on the wall! It's so cool!"

21:40.876 --> 21:41.876
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

21:41.959 --> 21:43.375
"How'd you do that?"

21:43.459 --> 21:45.209
He's a horror movie villain.
You can't kill him.

21:45.292 --> 21:47.334
His weapon is just
effusive nothingness.

21:47.417 --> 21:48.417
He just keeps coming.

21:53.626 --> 21:56.626
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING, APPLAUDING)

22:03.751 --> 22:04.751
Nice.

22:06.417 --> 22:07.500
(SIGHS)

22:10.834 --> 22:12.042
Look, I just think

22:12.125 --> 22:13.876
if entertainment
is gonna be this ubiquitous,

22:13.959 --> 22:16.876
it can't be this devoid
of humanity. It just can't. It--

22:17.918 --> 22:18.959
You know, 'cause I grew up,

22:19.042 --> 22:21.584
entertainment was
important to me.

22:21.667 --> 22:23.417
And so, you know,
I looked to it for something,

22:23.500 --> 22:25.918
and to be that devoid
of substance, it feels...

22:27.083 --> 22:28.083
insulting.

22:29.876 --> 22:32.792
The problem with entertainment
is that it's all made...

22:32.876 --> 22:36.459
by the same type of person.
It's made by entertainers.

22:37.417 --> 22:39.042
Right? So it's like...

22:39.125 --> 22:42.751
-Entertainers are psychotic.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

22:42.834 --> 22:45.667
Like, just statistically.
So, look at this room right now.

22:47.250 --> 22:50.542
Almost everybody
in the room is sitting nicely,

22:50.626 --> 22:52.042
looking at this,

22:52.125 --> 22:55.375
and only one person is like,
"Heh, heh, my thoughts."

22:55.459 --> 22:57.000
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

22:57.083 --> 22:59.417
"My thoughts."
And after this is over,

22:59.500 --> 23:01.125
you'll go home
to your respectable lives.

23:01.209 --> 23:02.459
And I'll try
to find another place

23:02.542 --> 23:04.083
to do, "My thoughts."

23:04.167 --> 23:05.792
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

23:05.876 --> 23:07.500
"Soon I'll be full."

23:07.584 --> 23:09.626
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

23:09.709 --> 23:11.167
So you have
to consider the source, right?

23:11.250 --> 23:13.250
I think about that
with all media.

23:13.334 --> 23:15.500
Social media,
for example, like, you know...

23:17.542 --> 23:19.375
You look at like Twitter
or something like that,

23:19.459 --> 23:20.500
it's like...

23:23.292 --> 23:26.417
Like Twitter--
Who's on Twitter? It's just...

23:26.500 --> 23:29.459
It's only people who think
it's like a good idea

23:29.542 --> 23:32.500
-to be on Twitter. Like...
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

23:33.125 --> 23:34.334
It's not everybody.

23:34.417 --> 23:37.042
It pretends to be everybody,
like, "Ooh, everyone's mad."

23:37.125 --> 23:38.209
You look at the trending topics,

23:38.292 --> 23:39.542
"Ooh, what's everyone
talking about?"

23:39.626 --> 23:42.209
It's not.
Most people aren't on it.

23:42.292 --> 23:43.667
Eighty percent of the public
doesn't use it.

23:43.751 --> 23:45.876
Ninety percent, I think,
doesn't use it regularly.

23:46.876 --> 23:49.375
So, like, what's trending?
Like...

23:49.459 --> 23:51.334
Most people aren't there,
so what's really trending

23:51.417 --> 23:53.500
is shutting the fuck up.
Like, most people...

23:53.584 --> 23:54.792
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

23:54.876 --> 23:56.334
Most people are doing that,
but you can't register that.

23:56.417 --> 23:59.667
You can't show somebody
not tweeting. Like you can't...

23:59.751 --> 24:02.500
They should show how much
we don't tweet also.

24:02.584 --> 24:04.334
They should show like a tweet,
and then

24:04.417 --> 24:07.584
you scroll through blank space
for like seven hours.

24:07.667 --> 24:08.792
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

24:08.876 --> 24:10.459
And then you come across
another tweet.

24:10.542 --> 24:13.209
You'd be like, "This is
a barren wasteland
for lunatics."

24:13.292 --> 24:15.375
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

24:21.375 --> 24:23.542
Everyone on Twitter
is somebody on Twitter.

24:24.876 --> 24:27.709
There's an inherent insanity
in the medium.

24:27.792 --> 24:29.792
Right? It's the same reason
I can't trust Yelp.

24:30.584 --> 24:32.751
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

24:32.834 --> 24:34.792
Every time I look at Yelp,
I read a Yelp review,

24:34.876 --> 24:37.626
I'm like, "Yeah, but this person
wrote a Yelp review."

24:37.709 --> 24:39.459
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

24:39.542 --> 24:41.709
"Why am I listening to a person
who logged in

24:41.792 --> 24:44.167
to write three paragraphs
on broccoli rabe?"

24:44.250 --> 24:46.375
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

24:46.459 --> 24:47.834
Everyone on Yelp
is someone on Yel--

24:47.918 --> 24:49.459
Every Yelp review starts
with someone going,

24:49.542 --> 24:50.709
"I'm gonna write a Yelp review."

24:50.792 --> 24:53.167
Like, fuck whoever
that person is.

24:53.250 --> 24:55.709
But that's everyone on Yelp.

24:59.042 --> 25:00.834
Everyone on Yelp is someone
who uses Yelp.

25:00.918 --> 25:02.417
Everyone on Twitter is someone
who uses Twitter.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.751
I want a social media site
where the only way to use it

25:04.834 --> 25:06.375
is to not.

25:06.459 --> 25:07.876
Like, I don't wanna hear
the thoughts

25:07.959 --> 25:10.250
that you want me to think
that you think.

25:10.334 --> 25:11.667
I wanna hear what you think.

25:11.751 --> 25:15.584
I wanna hear what you don't even
let yourself think you think.

25:15.667 --> 25:16.959
You know those thoughts?
You ever have like

25:17.042 --> 25:18.459
a fucking crazy thought
that bubbles up,

25:18.542 --> 25:21.042
and you push it away,
you're like, "Didn't think it!

25:21.125 --> 25:23.000
Didn't think it.
Still a good person.

25:23.083 --> 25:25.459
Didn't-- 'Cause I didn't
think it all the way.

25:25.542 --> 25:27.876
I didn't finish the thought
that I clearly started,

25:27.959 --> 25:29.375
so somehow that's not me."

25:29.459 --> 25:32.417
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
-I want those.

25:32.500 --> 25:34.626
I want you
to cut open your heart

25:34.709 --> 25:35.709
and dump it into my brain.

25:35.792 --> 25:37.792
Intimacy is what
I'm looking for. Which is not--

25:37.876 --> 25:40.876
I shouldn't go to social media
for intimacy, you can't get it.

25:40.959 --> 25:43.125
You ever see someone try
to be intimate on social media?

25:43.209 --> 25:45.751
-It's fucking terrible.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

25:45.834 --> 25:46.959
It doesn't work. It never works,

25:47.042 --> 25:48.792
'cause it doesn't have
the language for intimacy.

25:48.876 --> 25:50.375
'Cause intimacy is amorphous.

25:50.459 --> 25:52.000
It doesn't come
with a character limit,

25:52.083 --> 25:54.667
or a soundtrack, or filter,
it's just...

25:54.751 --> 25:56.459
(GRUNTS)

25:56.542 --> 25:59.167
The language of social media,
is like, snark and division

25:59.250 --> 26:00.709
and attacks and clapbacks

26:00.792 --> 26:04.959
and, "Oh, that? Oh, clearly
you don't even know
about this."

26:05.042 --> 26:06.876
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

26:06.959 --> 26:09.500
That rises.
That gets a lot of attention.

26:12.876 --> 26:15.918
But we're all, like, fucked up,
right? It's like very confusing,

26:16.000 --> 26:18.417
and there's a big market
right now for certainty.

26:18.500 --> 26:21.751
Anyone who has an answer,
even if it's the wrong one,

26:21.834 --> 26:23.500
is in demand.

26:23.584 --> 26:25.375
That's why you get this
whole rash of people

26:25.459 --> 26:26.834
who garner these followings,

26:26.918 --> 26:28.959
'cause they're giving
people a narrative.

26:29.042 --> 26:32.500
All these like, you know,
podcast hosts, demagogue type,

26:32.584 --> 26:35.125
usually a white dude
who's like, "Hey, the media

26:35.209 --> 26:36.792
and the government
are all lying to you,

26:36.876 --> 26:37.834
but you know who's not?"

to sell you CBD oil

26:46.334 --> 26:48.876
I'm your beacon of truth.

26:48.959 --> 26:52.584
Wear me, listen to me."
This is collective narcissism.

26:57.417 --> 26:59.709
It's changed the way we think,
like the way we process

26:59.792 --> 27:02.083
our own language,
like how we sound.

27:03.042 --> 27:04.542
I remember in the '16 election,

27:04.626 --> 27:07.125
they were talking about the Rock
maybe running for president,

27:07.209 --> 27:08.751
and I said that to a friend,
I was like,

27:08.834 --> 27:11.167
"Yo, I heard the Rock
might run for president."

27:11.250 --> 27:13.584
My buddy was like,
"Is the Rock a Democrat?"

27:13.667 --> 27:15.542
And I was like, "Dude,
listen to the sentence..."

27:15.626 --> 27:18.209
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

27:18.292 --> 27:21.042
"...that you just said.
Is the Rock a Democrat?

27:21.125 --> 27:23.792
I don't know. He's a fake
wrestling character.

27:25.209 --> 27:27.334
I don't know where he stands
on healthcare."

27:28.542 --> 27:30.334
Is the Rock a Democrat?
I don't know.

27:30.417 --> 27:32.959
Did the Yellow Power Ranger
support the war in Iraq?

27:33.042 --> 27:34.959
What the fuck
are we talking about?

27:35.042 --> 27:37.918
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

27:38.000 --> 27:41.292
Where does Mickey Mouse stand
on abortion? I don't know.

27:41.375 --> 27:43.709
Is he a "second trimester
or before" kind of mouse,

27:43.792 --> 27:46.459
or more like a hardline...
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) "Life
begins at conception, folks."

27:46.542 --> 27:49.292
Like, I don't know
what Mickey thinks.

27:49.375 --> 27:50.751
Does Mickey think,
or does he just do

27:50.834 --> 27:52.459
whatever the artist
makes him do?

27:52.542 --> 27:53.959
Is there a consciousness
in Mickey?

27:54.042 --> 27:56.000
Do any of us think,
or are we just being guided

27:56.083 --> 27:57.083
by an unseen hand?

27:57.167 --> 27:58.584
Is thinking part
of the illusion?

27:58.667 --> 27:59.834
Is Descartes a fraud?

27:59.918 --> 28:01.417
This is why
I had to get off of Twitter.

28:01.500 --> 28:04.751
I existentially spiral.
I lose who I am.

28:06.292 --> 28:08.584
I did, I deleted my Twitter
a year ago.

28:10.667 --> 28:13.125
I still have Instagram
because I'm stupid.

28:13.209 --> 28:15.083
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

28:15.167 --> 28:19.459
Instagram is... It's like hell.
It's just like hell.

28:19.542 --> 28:22.542
You can download
hell to your phone for free.

28:22.626 --> 28:24.709
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-It's free. Hell is free.

28:26.459 --> 28:28.042
Instagram is just like, "Hey...

28:28.959 --> 28:32.918
uh, are you not feeling
jealous today?"

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

28:35.751 --> 28:37.876
"Come hang out.

28:37.959 --> 28:40.125
Look, there's a beer,
some food you'll never eat.

28:40.209 --> 28:43.334
Go fuck yourself. We hate you.

28:43.417 --> 28:46.626
We are trying to tear you down.
We don't give a fuck.

28:46.709 --> 28:48.000
Here's places you'll never go.

28:48.083 --> 28:49.626
Here's a person
that will never fuck you.

28:49.709 --> 28:52.792
Go fuck yourself. We hate you."

28:52.876 --> 28:54.626
"We are manipulating
your emotions,

28:54.709 --> 28:55.709
and then monitoring them

28:55.792 --> 28:57.584
so we can sell you shit.
You want a bracelet?

28:57.667 --> 29:00.083
Yeah, we knew you would,
motherfucker." Literally.

29:00.167 --> 29:01.709
Literally! Literally.

29:01.792 --> 29:03.584
People are like,
"What do those bracelets mean?"

29:03.667 --> 29:05.209
They mean I'm a fucking moron!

29:05.292 --> 29:06.417
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

29:06.500 --> 29:08.375
They mean I was depressed
and got a targeted ad

29:08.459 --> 29:10.667
and thought these bracelets
would turn it all around.

29:10.751 --> 29:11.834
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

29:11.918 --> 29:13.626
That's what they mean.

29:13.709 --> 29:15.334
"You are nothing.
We have hollowed you out

29:15.417 --> 29:16.542
and emptied you

29:16.626 --> 29:18.334
and filled you with ourselves
and the desire for more.

29:18.417 --> 29:21.125
You are powerless against it.
This is a takeover.

29:21.209 --> 29:23.125
Didn't happen the way
it did in Terminator.

29:23.209 --> 29:25.375
It's a lot more subtle,
with more cat videos

29:25.459 --> 29:27.667
and 14-year-olds twerking.
Is that a crime?

29:27.751 --> 29:29.250
Ha, ha. We'll never tell you."

29:29.334 --> 29:31.709
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

29:34.792 --> 29:35.918
I hate it.

29:36.709 --> 29:37.792
It makes me feel like shit.

29:37.876 --> 29:39.876
The only social media site
that I like...

29:41.792 --> 29:43.751
is, uh, Venmo.

29:43.834 --> 29:48.167
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

29:49.000 --> 29:51.792
That's right. I like Venmo.

29:51.876 --> 29:54.000
Venmo's a money transfer app,
which everybody knows.

29:54.083 --> 29:56.042
But what not everybody knows
is that on Venmo,

29:56.125 --> 29:58.417
there's a feed,
where you can like...

29:58.500 --> 30:00.959
tab over and you can see
all of your friends'

30:01.042 --> 30:03.042
and your contacts'
financial transactions,

30:03.125 --> 30:04.792
which should be illegal,
but it's there.

30:04.876 --> 30:05.959
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

30:06.042 --> 30:08.417
It's right there. And I like it
because it's honest.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.542
It's the only honest
social media site out there.

30:10.626 --> 30:12.334
Every other social media site
is a projection

30:12.417 --> 30:15.876
of a version of yourself
that you wish you were
onto a canvas. Not Venmo.

30:15.959 --> 30:19.417
Venmo is the honest antidote
to the horseshit of Instagram.

30:19.500 --> 30:20.918
Instagram makes you feel bad

30:21.000 --> 30:22.876
because you're aware
of your own fears

30:22.959 --> 30:24.417
and insecurities
and preoccupations,

30:24.500 --> 30:26.042
but you're not seeing
anybody else's.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.542
So you're always
gonna lean that way.

30:27.626 --> 30:30.042
So you see a picture on
Instagram of, like, a couple...

30:30.834 --> 30:33.417
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

30:35.375 --> 30:37.876
Maybe they're on,
like, a beach...

30:37.959 --> 30:39.876
looking at a gorgeous sunset.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.918
Maybe they're eating a pizza.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.792
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

30:46.876 --> 30:49.959
You look at this, you're like,
"What the fuck? What the fuck?

30:50.042 --> 30:51.167
The fuck is wrong with me?

30:51.250 --> 30:53.209
How come
I'm not doing that shit, huh?

30:53.292 --> 30:54.417
Is there something
wrong with me?

30:54.500 --> 30:56.751
Is there a hole here
that everybody can see?

30:56.834 --> 30:59.250
Do I emanate darkness,
do I repel love?

30:59.334 --> 31:01.542
Is there a limit
to my emotional aptitude?

31:01.626 --> 31:03.626
Did my father's genetics
set that limit?

31:03.709 --> 31:05.334
Do I need to go back
on antidepressants?

31:05.417 --> 31:08.167
What the fuck
is going on inside of me

31:08.250 --> 31:10.042
that's not leading me
to that type of bliss?

31:10.125 --> 31:12.334
What do I have to do
to get there?"

31:12.417 --> 31:14.500
But then you look at Venmo
and it's like,

31:14.584 --> 31:17.375
"Oh, no, dude,
they split that pizza."

31:17.459 --> 31:20.125
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

31:20.209 --> 31:24.042
(APPLAUSE)

31:31.792 --> 31:35.125
-"I'm doing just fine."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

31:35.209 --> 31:36.584
"I don't need medication."

31:38.542 --> 31:40.500
(CHUCKLES)

31:40.584 --> 31:42.083
It's not a referendum
on splitting stuff

31:42.167 --> 31:43.000
in a relationship.

31:43.083 --> 31:44.334
I think
if you're gonna split stuff,

31:44.417 --> 31:46.042
just don't split the items.

31:46.667 --> 31:48.250
Go every other.

31:48.334 --> 31:49.751
Does that make sense?

31:49.834 --> 31:51.584
I'll see that on Venmo.
I go on Venmo, I'll see,

31:51.667 --> 31:53.834
"Boyfriend sends girlfriend
money for tacos."

31:53.918 --> 31:55.918
I'm just, like, how the fuck
do you go down on someone

31:56.000 --> 31:57.709
after you just sent them
eight bucks?

31:57.792 --> 32:00.083
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

32:05.209 --> 32:06.459
(SCOFFS)

32:08.918 --> 32:10.918
"You're just bitter, Drew,
that you have no one

32:11.000 --> 32:12.167
to split stuff with."

32:12.250 --> 32:14.000
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

32:15.709 --> 32:16.918
Yeah, I'm single.

32:17.542 --> 32:20.375
I'm 36... and single.

32:20.459 --> 32:22.959
I'm single and 36,
which is fine.

32:23.042 --> 32:26.792
Uh, but it is almost not.

32:26.876 --> 32:29.042
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

32:30.667 --> 32:34.000
Like, it's not bad yet,
but bad is next.

32:34.083 --> 32:36.751
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

32:37.751 --> 32:41.500
Bad is the next stop
on this... train.

32:47.125 --> 32:49.959
A lot of my friends are married.

32:50.042 --> 32:51.292
And it's cool to see.

32:51.375 --> 32:52.959
A lot of them are in, like,
really great relationships,

32:53.042 --> 32:54.876
really healthy, good,
loving relationships.

32:54.959 --> 32:55.959
And it's really amazing to see.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.751
I go to their weddings,
I really enjoy it.

32:57.834 --> 33:00.375
Seeing them come together,
it's a beautiful thing.

33:00.459 --> 33:03.292
And I hear a lot
of the same things in the vows.

33:03.375 --> 33:04.834
There's a common refrain
in the vows,

33:04.918 --> 33:06.334
which is something about,
like, you know,

33:06.417 --> 33:08.584
"I get to marry my best friend."

33:08.667 --> 33:11.500
"I'm so lucky to have found
my best friend."

33:11.584 --> 33:13.667
"I never thought I would spend
the rest of my life

33:13.751 --> 33:15.042
with my best friend."

33:16.042 --> 33:17.042
And I hear that, I'm like,

33:17.125 --> 33:18.876
"That's such
a beautiful sentiment."

33:18.959 --> 33:22.334
Like, the person
you marry should feel...

33:23.167 --> 33:24.918
like your best friend.

33:26.751 --> 33:28.918
I'm in the back,
I'm like, "Well, I'm 36,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.959
so who the fuck
meets their best friend

33:32.042 --> 33:34.000
in their late thirties?"

33:34.083 --> 33:35.250
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

33:35.334 --> 33:37.292
Who's out there like,
"This is my best friend!

33:37.375 --> 33:38.918
We met when were 38!"

33:39.000 --> 33:41.209
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

33:42.042 --> 33:43.292
"Tell him, Doug!"

33:43.375 --> 33:45.959
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

33:48.542 --> 33:50.709
No, it doesn't happen.

33:50.792 --> 33:53.542
They're all having kids, too,
starting families.

33:53.626 --> 33:56.876
My friends starting families,
it's beautiful to see.

33:56.959 --> 33:59.125
I don't have my own family.

33:59.209 --> 34:01.918
I have, like, a family
from which I've come.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.042
I don't have...

34:03.125 --> 34:05.459
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
-...the next line on that.

34:05.542 --> 34:08.292
Like on a family tree,
I'm just a node that ends.

34:08.375 --> 34:10.417
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

34:10.500 --> 34:11.667
It's just like, "Who's that?"

34:11.751 --> 34:13.959
"That's your great Uncle Drew,
nobody loved him."

34:14.042 --> 34:15.459
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

34:15.542 --> 34:16.918
Just a leaf on a twig.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.876
Just a Styrofoam ball
with no toothpicks,

34:18.959 --> 34:20.751
if we're using
school project lingo.

34:20.834 --> 34:22.751
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

34:26.250 --> 34:27.709
"Oh, cool,
you got me a PlayStation

34:27.792 --> 34:29.709
for my birthday.
I love you, Dad."

34:31.334 --> 34:33.500
I just beat God of War
for the fourth time.

34:33.584 --> 34:35.125
(AUDIENCE MEMBER CHEERING)

34:37.459 --> 34:40.375
-It's a good game.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

34:40.459 --> 34:44.834
It's not
"hugging my smiling child" good.

34:44.918 --> 34:47.626
(AUDIENCE LAUGH)

34:48.751 --> 34:50.834
But the gameplay mechanics
are pretty tight.

34:50.918 --> 34:53.792
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

34:58.375 --> 35:01.334
I think part of the reason
I don't... have a family,

35:01.417 --> 35:02.876
well, at least
what I used to tell myself,

35:02.959 --> 35:04.125
is that I do this.

35:04.209 --> 35:06.876
It's something that I chose.
I chose a different path.

35:06.959 --> 35:10.083
I remember I started doing
stand-up when I was 22.

35:10.167 --> 35:13.542
I dropped out of school, and...

35:13.626 --> 35:14.959
at the time,
my mother warned me.

35:15.042 --> 35:16.375
She said, "You know,
it's not very stable.

35:16.459 --> 35:18.459
You're gonna be living
hand-to-mouth, traveling a lot.

35:18.542 --> 35:20.626
You're not gonna be able
to settle down."

35:20.709 --> 35:22.542
And she was right to an extent.

35:22.626 --> 35:24.292
But the problem was,
she was telling this

35:24.375 --> 35:26.709
to a 22-year-old dude.

35:26.792 --> 35:30.626
Like the least likely candidate
on Earth to settle down.

35:32.125 --> 35:33.834
I don't know if you know
any 22-year-old dudes,

35:33.918 --> 35:35.584
but they're
not technically people.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.542
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

35:38.584 --> 35:40.459
Just unprocessed pain and skin.

35:40.542 --> 35:43.500
Like, that's pretty much
the identity there.

35:44.334 --> 35:45.626
So, 22, I'm hearing this,

35:45.709 --> 35:48.334
I'm like, "Settle down?
What are you, a hundred?

35:49.083 --> 35:50.334
I don't give a fuck.

35:51.584 --> 35:53.542
I'm going on the road, Mom.

35:54.334 --> 35:56.751
I'ma follow my dreams!

35:56.834 --> 35:59.083
Nobody is gonna stop me!"

36:00.667 --> 36:02.709
That was my attitude.
Now I'm 36.

36:02.792 --> 36:04.959
Now I see the punchline.
Now it's like...

36:05.042 --> 36:11.375
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

36:14.292 --> 36:17.626
"Nobody is going
to hug me as I die."

36:17.709 --> 36:19.209
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

36:19.292 --> 36:21.834
(CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY)

36:21.918 --> 36:23.125
Is that funny? I don't know.

36:23.209 --> 36:26.417
I structured it as a joke.
Does that make it funny?

36:26.500 --> 36:29.083
I don't know. Does comedy have
the ability to transform

36:29.167 --> 36:31.042
the emotional constitution
of reality,

36:31.125 --> 36:34.709
or is it just adding a layer
to an unfortunate event?

36:34.792 --> 36:37.459
I don't know how the physics
of comedy work.

36:41.209 --> 36:44.000
I used to tell myself that
it was a sacrifice I was making.

36:44.083 --> 36:47.083
I was leaving that on the side
to pursue this.

36:47.918 --> 36:48.834
And I used to look--

36:48.918 --> 36:50.751
It was very easy
to make that argument,

36:50.834 --> 36:53.584
'cause I used to look around
and there were a lot of men

36:53.667 --> 36:57.000
who accomplished things
that I considered to be great,

36:57.083 --> 36:59.959
whose personal life was
kind of left by the wayside.

37:00.042 --> 37:02.459
And so it seemed to me
as a necessary component.

37:02.542 --> 37:05.459
I remember in high school
I learned about Isaac Newton.

37:05.542 --> 37:08.792
And Isaac Newton
invented calculus.

37:10.209 --> 37:11.876
He also died a virgin.

37:11.959 --> 37:14.918
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

37:15.000 --> 37:17.542
Which begs the question,
can you invent calculus

37:17.626 --> 37:18.876
while fucking people?

37:18.959 --> 37:21.626
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

37:22.500 --> 37:23.500
I don't know.

37:25.083 --> 37:26.375
It's never been done.

37:26.459 --> 37:29.000
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

37:38.042 --> 37:40.209
A more modern example,
Steve Jobs.

37:40.292 --> 37:43.125
Steve Jobs was
an incredible innovator...

37:43.751 --> 37:45.876
uh, terrible father...

37:45.959 --> 37:47.584
right, which we know,
it's documented,

37:47.667 --> 37:49.042
but we also just knew.

37:49.125 --> 37:51.459
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

37:52.709 --> 37:53.667
We knew.

37:53.751 --> 37:55.125
Every time we'd go
into our pocket,

37:55.209 --> 37:56.375
if Steve Jobs were a good dad,

37:56.459 --> 37:59.292
we'd pull out a Samsung
or a Motorola.

37:59.375 --> 38:00.834
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

38:00.918 --> 38:02.792
Every time you text someone
and it shows up blue,

38:02.876 --> 38:05.542
that's Steve Jobs not going
to a piano recital

38:05.626 --> 38:09.667
-or a softball game.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

38:09.751 --> 38:11.626
And I don't think
we have the right to judge him.

38:11.709 --> 38:14.209
Like, we are all glad he did it.
Like, we encouraged that.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.417
As a society,
we would all rather

38:16.500 --> 38:18.876
one girl grow up
with a shitty dad

38:18.959 --> 38:21.292
than have to all of us
use Windows.

38:21.375 --> 38:23.334
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

38:23.417 --> 38:25.250
You want us all
to click a Start button

38:25.334 --> 38:27.042
and run clunky .exe files

38:27.125 --> 38:28.709
just so one girl
can open her gifts

38:28.792 --> 38:30.500
next to the guy
who paid for them?

38:30.584 --> 38:32.626
Fuck that! She can get them
from a nanny

38:32.709 --> 38:34.375
while the rest of us
enjoy our...

38:34.459 --> 38:37.292
technological ecosystem
seamlessly integrated.

38:37.375 --> 38:38.876
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

38:38.959 --> 38:41.542
That's what we encourage.
We encourage it.

38:41.626 --> 38:43.584
True happiness
has no societal value.

38:43.667 --> 38:45.792
We want productivity.

38:45.876 --> 38:49.584
Give us... Make something
or shut up! Like, we don't care.

38:49.667 --> 38:52.334
So there's this incentive
to do it.

38:52.417 --> 38:55.250
And it gets even more fucked up.
Someone like Michael Jackson,

38:55.334 --> 38:59.667
who was this incredible popstar
and a horrendous babysitter,

38:59.751 --> 39:00.918
you know,
where it's just like...

39:01.000 --> 39:02.125
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

39:02.209 --> 39:04.375
Yeah, it's an easy one,
but it's fun. It's fun, though.

39:04.459 --> 39:06.209
It's so easy, but it's so fun.

39:06.292 --> 39:09.125
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

39:09.209 --> 39:10.334
No, but even that, like

39:10.417 --> 39:12.334
there's such an instinct
to defend these guys.

39:12.417 --> 39:13.834
Like my first instinct is
to be like--

39:13.918 --> 39:16.500
see it from their side,
because I think we're such...

39:16.584 --> 39:19.125
we're conditioned to like them
on that level.

39:19.209 --> 39:20.417
So even with Michael,
I was like--

39:20.500 --> 39:21.667
you know,
there was a part of me--

39:21.751 --> 39:23.000
I watched that documentary
about him,

39:23.083 --> 39:24.626
I was like,
"Oh, that's fucked up."

39:24.709 --> 39:26.125
But there was a part of me
that was like,

39:26.209 --> 39:27.918
"Yeah, but if not
an eight-year-old boy,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.792
who was Michael Jackson
supposed to date?"

39:30.876 --> 39:33.834
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

39:33.918 --> 39:35.500
You know what I mean?
What is he looking at,

39:35.584 --> 39:38.250
options-wise,
that makes any sense at all?

39:38.334 --> 39:40.042
Somebody his age? He did that.

39:40.125 --> 39:42.459
He was married
to Lisa Marie Presley,

39:42.542 --> 39:47.417
a grown woman,
and that was weirder somehow.

39:47.500 --> 39:50.125
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

39:50.209 --> 39:52.500
That was weirder.
They made out on television.

39:52.584 --> 39:54.459
It was fucking weird.

39:54.542 --> 39:55.959
There was like
an awards show presentation

39:56.042 --> 39:57.626
and at the end,
they like did this kiss,

39:57.709 --> 39:59.209
it was just awful.
Like, "Oh!"

39:59.292 --> 40:01.459
The whole world
was just like, "Oh, my God."

40:01.542 --> 40:02.542
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

40:02.626 --> 40:05.250
"Jesus, will somebody
get this guy a kid?"

40:05.334 --> 40:09.375
-Like, "This is horrible."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

40:09.459 --> 40:11.083
Because Michael Jackson
with a kid,

40:11.167 --> 40:13.542
it upsets us morally,
but it looks right.

40:13.626 --> 40:16.000
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

40:18.334 --> 40:19.500
Michael can't date an adult.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.417
You wouldn't set
your friend up with him.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.626
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

40:23.709 --> 40:25.167
Who's he supposed to...
What is he gonna do,

40:25.250 --> 40:26.292
go on like a blind date

40:26.375 --> 40:28.751
with a 35-year-old
software developer?

40:30.042 --> 40:32.209
How's that gonna go? "Hey,
nice to meet you, Michael."

40:32.292 --> 40:35.459
He's like, "You wanna play tag?
You're it." Like, come on.

40:35.542 --> 40:36.626
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

40:36.709 --> 40:37.751
"Where are your..."

40:38.667 --> 40:40.542
"Tag?
I thought we'd go to dinner."

40:40.626 --> 40:41.834
"Dinner's for dumb-dumbs.

40:41.918 --> 40:44.125
We can eat candy at my house
and stay up as late as we want.

40:44.209 --> 40:45.083
Tee-hee!"

40:45.167 --> 40:47.667
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

40:50.042 --> 40:51.292
Michael can't date an adult.

40:51.375 --> 40:53.918
I don't even know what kind
of adult would be into Michael.

40:55.459 --> 40:58.709
Like you wanna...
you wanna fuck him?

40:58.792 --> 41:00.626
Listen to him sure,
but, like, you wanna...

41:00.709 --> 41:02.918
(IMITATES MICHAEL JACKSON)
You wanna fuck that guy?

41:03.000 --> 41:05.500
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
-You wanna fuck him?

41:05.584 --> 41:08.334
"Here, doo-doo head."
You're gonna fuck him?

41:09.417 --> 41:10.709
Dude, if you're an adult

41:10.792 --> 41:13.417
and you wanna fuck
Michael Jackson...

41:14.292 --> 41:15.667
you're a pedophile.

41:15.751 --> 41:19.584
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

41:26.834 --> 41:28.709
But you look at all these guys,
you know,

41:28.792 --> 41:30.834
Michael Jackson, Isaac Newton,
Steve Jobs,

41:30.918 --> 41:33.626
they were adored by the world

41:33.709 --> 41:35.751
but hated by the people
closest to them.

41:40.751 --> 41:42.584
And I would imagine
that you'd tell yourself

41:42.667 --> 41:44.125
that that's a sacrifice...

41:45.792 --> 41:48.209
that you make, but...

41:48.292 --> 41:50.334
as I get older,
I look at it differently.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.083
I don't know if I look at it
as a sacrifice anymore.

41:54.167 --> 41:55.334
Maybe-- maybe not.

41:56.667 --> 41:57.792
Maybe...

42:00.417 --> 42:02.459
they just ran
from responsibility

42:02.542 --> 42:04.876
into the arms of ambition.

42:04.959 --> 42:06.834
You know,
maybe Apple and Pixar...

42:08.000 --> 42:10.542
are just built off the back
of one man's inability

42:10.626 --> 42:13.209
to be intimate
with the people closest to him.

42:14.500 --> 42:15.709
Or with himself.

42:17.417 --> 42:19.709
And so it recasts my own path,

42:19.792 --> 42:22.000
where I'm like,
maybe this isn't a sacrifice.

42:23.417 --> 42:25.167
I'm not comparing myself to...

42:26.292 --> 42:28.083
Steve Jobs and...

42:28.167 --> 42:30.918
Isaac Newton, you know.
It's a matter of scale.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.792
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

42:33.876 --> 42:35.209
But even in the comedy world,

42:35.292 --> 42:37.459
even the people
that I looked up to...

42:37.542 --> 42:39.792
When I started, all the people
that I looked up to,

42:39.876 --> 42:42.667
they're all either, like,
prematurely dead,

42:42.751 --> 42:45.417
utterly miserable, or, like,
sex criminals.

42:45.500 --> 42:48.292
So... where is this headed?

42:48.375 --> 42:51.083
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

42:52.083 --> 42:53.751
Where is this path going?

42:57.667 --> 43:00.209
Their greatness is predicated
on their accomplishments,

43:00.292 --> 43:02.250
but we fail to recognize
how they failed

43:02.334 --> 43:03.459
in their private moments.

43:03.542 --> 43:07.042
And I think that's a masculine
definition of greatness.

43:07.125 --> 43:09.709
Because, like, I don't look
at that as great anymore

43:09.792 --> 43:12.667
because they couldn't confront
who they were as a person.

43:12.751 --> 43:14.918
They couldn't confront
the emotional reality

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
of their experience.

43:16.083 --> 43:18.292
That is greatness to me.
To do that,

43:18.375 --> 43:21.209
that is a much greater thing.

43:21.292 --> 43:24.959
How great can something be
if it's built on avoidance?

43:28.250 --> 43:29.918
I think you have to...

43:33.209 --> 43:34.250
confront.

43:35.125 --> 43:36.167
And it's scary.

43:36.250 --> 43:38.375
It's a scary fucking thing
to do. Like, I get it.

43:38.459 --> 43:41.167
It's like totally scary
for a lot of reasons.

43:41.250 --> 43:43.209
One, you can find out
that the story you've been

43:43.292 --> 43:45.459
telling yourself about yourself
isn't true.

43:45.542 --> 43:47.334
You can find out that
what you thought was like

43:47.417 --> 43:50.292
the harsh, brutal reality
of yourself,

43:50.375 --> 43:52.751
you're just resting
on an easier narrative

43:52.834 --> 43:55.042
that could be subverted
by something else.

43:55.125 --> 43:57.542
Like I used to tell
myself stories about myself

43:57.626 --> 43:59.042
that have shifted over time.

43:59.125 --> 44:00.876
I used to tell myself
this was a sacrifice.

44:00.959 --> 44:03.000
I used to tell myself
that what I was doing up here

44:03.083 --> 44:05.542
was important,
that it was fearless.

44:05.626 --> 44:06.918
That I was fearless
for doing this.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.751
I had the balls to say shit
that nobody else did.

44:09.834 --> 44:11.334
Things like
that Michael Jackson joke,

44:11.417 --> 44:13.167
I'd be like, "That's fearless.

44:13.250 --> 44:15.459
That's a fearless fucking thing.
You can get mad at me.

44:15.542 --> 44:18.334
That's fearless.
I'm willing to stand that down."

44:18.417 --> 44:20.000
But as I get older, I'm like,
"That's not...

44:20.083 --> 44:22.334
I think it's funny,
but it's not fearless."

44:22.417 --> 44:25.459
Because my emotional experience
is nowhere in there.

44:26.375 --> 44:27.918
I'm nowhere in that joke.

44:29.292 --> 44:30.751
I wasn't molested,

44:31.792 --> 44:33.167
and I'm not a pedophile.

44:33.250 --> 44:35.042
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

44:36.375 --> 44:37.834
That would be fearless.

44:37.918 --> 44:40.876
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

44:43.000 --> 44:44.876
The most fearless pedophile joke
you could tell

44:44.959 --> 44:47.209
is to be one
and admit it publicly.

44:47.292 --> 44:48.959
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

44:50.792 --> 44:53.000
No, worst-case scenario,
worst-case scenario,

44:53.083 --> 44:55.667
the joke bombs
and you don't like it.

44:55.751 --> 44:59.125
You look at me, arms folded,
shaking your head and say, "No."

44:59.209 --> 45:01.209
Fortunately, that didn't happen
this evening,

45:01.292 --> 45:03.417
but it has happened.

45:03.500 --> 45:05.334
It could happen.
You can get mad.

45:05.417 --> 45:08.959
You could think I suck.
You could not like me.

45:11.584 --> 45:13.584
But, counterpoint...

45:15.083 --> 45:16.459
who are you?

45:16.542 --> 45:19.876
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

45:22.209 --> 45:25.125
I can barely see any of you,
and I love none of you.

45:25.209 --> 45:28.834
So what is this power...
that you hold over me?

45:29.709 --> 45:31.167
You're not me.

45:32.709 --> 45:35.000
We are always
our most terrifying audience.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.751
I believe that.

45:37.834 --> 45:39.334
That's why it's so funny
when people say

45:39.417 --> 45:40.959
that, like, public speaking

45:41.042 --> 45:42.584
is the number one fear
of people.

45:42.667 --> 45:43.959
They say, you hear that,
"Public speaking

45:44.042 --> 45:45.209
is the number one fear
of people."

45:45.292 --> 45:46.375
It's like, "Well, I'm sorry,

45:46.459 --> 45:48.542
was confronting yourself
on an emotional level

45:48.626 --> 45:50.584
not on that questionnaire?"

45:50.667 --> 45:52.417
The fuck you talking about,
public speaking?

45:52.500 --> 45:54.375
I'm public speaking right now.

45:55.584 --> 45:56.918
It's fine.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.834
I'm public speaking as a way

45:58.918 --> 46:02.459
to avoid confronting myself
on an emotional level.

46:02.542 --> 46:04.375
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

46:04.459 --> 46:06.000
This is all.

46:06.083 --> 46:07.751
Like, up here it's, like,
"Dopamine!"

46:07.834 --> 46:11.042
And if I were at home,
it'd be like... (SCREECHES)

46:11.918 --> 46:13.584
(SCREECHES)

46:15.792 --> 46:17.500
I have used this
to avoid so many--

46:17.584 --> 46:19.459
I can't tell you how many
relationships I've been in

46:19.542 --> 46:21.417
where I've been like,
"Oh, sorry, I can't hang out
with you tonight.

46:21.500 --> 46:23.709
I have to go do a show."
Or more specifically,

46:23.792 --> 46:25.959
"Sorry, I can't be there
on your birthday.

46:26.042 --> 46:27.334
I need to go do this bit

46:27.417 --> 46:29.667
about how all my relationships
fall apart."

46:29.751 --> 46:32.083
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

46:32.167 --> 46:34.584
It's like just,
"Do I need any of this?"

46:37.626 --> 46:40.083
And I think as men,
we have this tendency

46:40.167 --> 46:42.626
to wanna process everything
in our lives through,

46:42.709 --> 46:46.584
you know, intellect, or logic,
or our thoughts, or our reason,

46:46.667 --> 46:48.459
things that we do,
things that are tactile,

46:48.542 --> 46:50.042
and it's like...

46:50.125 --> 46:53.042
you're ignoring the entire
emotional subset

46:53.125 --> 46:54.375
of your experience.

46:54.459 --> 46:56.959
And this idea that logic
and emotions are separate,

46:57.042 --> 46:58.125
they're not.

46:58.209 --> 47:00.334
Like your thoughts are
not separate from how you feel.

47:00.417 --> 47:01.375
Your thoughts...

47:01.459 --> 47:03.834
Thoughts are just emotions
in drag.

47:03.918 --> 47:07.500

47:07.584 --> 47:09.209
It's the same ecosystem.

47:13.209 --> 47:14.918
It's hard to dive in...

47:15.667 --> 47:16.667
like that.

47:18.167 --> 47:20.459

47:20.542 --> 47:22.626

a lot of people need...

47:23.584 --> 47:26.083
They're men-- all men.

47:26.167 --> 47:27.959

47:28.042 --> 47:29.584
Yeah,
I'm comfortable saying that.

47:29.667 --> 47:32.125
All men need to go

47:32.209 --> 47:33.584

47:34.876 --> 47:36.375

47:43.792 --> 47:46.209

need shit, you pandering pussy."

47:50.375 --> 47:51.459
"What was that?"

47:51.542 --> 47:53.167
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

47:56.709 --> 47:58.209
Women need therapy too.

48:01.209 --> 48:03.042
But usually when a woman
goes to therapy,

48:03.125 --> 48:05.584
it's because
a man in her life didn't.

48:05.667 --> 48:10.792
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

48:12.792 --> 48:16.167
I started going
four times a week.

48:16.250 --> 48:19.542
It's a program, it's called
psychoanalysis, and it's, uh...

48:20.292 --> 48:21.500
The reason you go so often

48:21.584 --> 48:23.375
is so that you don't have time
to close up.

48:23.459 --> 48:26.167
Like, if you go once a week,
you have all week
to just close back up,

48:26.250 --> 48:27.918
so you stay open
throughout the week

48:28.000 --> 48:29.250
so you can access
parts of yourself

48:29.334 --> 48:31.959
that are much harder
to access normally.

48:32.042 --> 48:34.042
And so it's very emotional.
It's very exhausting.

48:34.125 --> 48:37.292
It's very trying. I cry a lot.

48:37.375 --> 48:42.834
I sob-- The other day, I sobbed
for, like, 20 minutes straight.

48:42.918 --> 48:45.375
And this is how fucked up I am.
As soon as I collected myself,

48:45.459 --> 48:46.667
my first thought was,

48:46.751 --> 48:48.792
"That shouldn't count
toward my time."

48:48.876 --> 48:52.584
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

48:54.918 --> 48:57.000
But that's me trying to get out
of that moment.

48:57.083 --> 48:59.792
Like that moment was
hard to swallow, and so...

49:02.375 --> 49:04.834
joke, out, now we're out of it.

49:04.918 --> 49:06.876
But I don't think
that's how progress gets made.

49:06.959 --> 49:08.250
I think
if you wanna make progress,

49:08.334 --> 49:10.042
you can't take that left turn
at a punchline.

49:10.125 --> 49:11.292
You have to go...

49:11.375 --> 49:13.709
You have to sit there
and process it there.

49:13.792 --> 49:15.542
You have to go down.
You have to take that

49:15.626 --> 49:19.334

all the way.

49:19.417 --> 49:21.626

to your emotional core!"

(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

49:23.083 --> 49:25.209
"Look out your left window.
Is that Mom going on a date

49:25.292 --> 49:27.542
instead of hanging out with you?
Yes, it is."

49:27.626 --> 49:32.375
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
-"Process it! Feel it!"

49:34.626 --> 49:37.542
You have to stay there,
and leave it there.

49:37.626 --> 49:39.500
You can't buy yourself
out of the moment.

49:39.584 --> 49:41.834
Otherwise, the progress
won't get made.

49:41.918 --> 49:43.375
It's very hard to do.

49:47.417 --> 49:51.959
And I'm up here and I, like,
I want to bring you in.

49:52.876 --> 49:54.209
Like, that's where
this is going.

49:54.292 --> 49:55.542
Like I want--
That's the next step,

49:55.626 --> 49:59.042
is I want to bring you all
to that place.

49:59.125 --> 50:00.959
But it's hard
because, like, I don't know

50:01.042 --> 50:02.667
if there's a show down there.

50:06.500 --> 50:09.918
But I wanna bring you in,
but I feel conflicted.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.375
I feel like I can't--
I have to like...

50:12.459 --> 50:13.709
I feel like
that's how this works,

50:13.792 --> 50:16.042
is I go in, I mine my own life
for sadness,

50:16.125 --> 50:18.417
and then I contort it
into a balloon animal for you

50:18.500 --> 50:20.083
so you don't feel ripped off.

50:20.167 --> 50:22.584
(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

50:27.792 --> 50:28.876
I tried...

50:30.209 --> 50:31.500
to do that. I wrote...

50:33.626 --> 50:34.876
I wrote a joke...

50:37.876 --> 50:39.250
that tries to do that.

50:56.459 --> 50:58.959
-Why did the chicken...
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)

50:59.042 --> 51:00.417
...cross the road?

51:01.751 --> 51:03.000
AUDIENCE: Why?

51:05.375 --> 51:06.626
Because...

51:08.250 --> 51:09.334
he grew up...

51:10.250 --> 51:12.959
with an untreated
hearing loss...

51:13.042 --> 51:16.417
which deprived him
of a major sensory connection

51:16.500 --> 51:19.209
to the people around him,
and it isolated him

51:19.292 --> 51:21.792
to the point of chronic torture.
And his parents

51:21.876 --> 51:25.167
were too caught up in their
own drama and insecurities

51:25.250 --> 51:27.209
to attend to it,
so he processed it

51:27.292 --> 51:29.751
as though there was something
inherently wrong with him.

51:29.834 --> 51:32.000
And his feelings are a threat
to his relationships,

51:32.083 --> 51:33.584
so he just suffered in silence,

51:33.667 --> 51:36.000
feeling like he was
100 feet underwater,

51:36.083 --> 51:38.250
wondering why nobody
was coming to save him.

51:38.334 --> 51:40.459
And then, he finally started
wearing hearing aids,

51:40.542 --> 51:42.042
which created
this insane sensation

51:42.125 --> 51:43.626
of being able
to participate in a world

51:43.709 --> 51:45.083
that he didn't understand.

51:45.167 --> 51:47.083
But because his self-worth
was predicated

51:47.167 --> 51:48.250
on how special he felt,

51:48.334 --> 51:50.083
he realized
that the trodden path

51:50.167 --> 51:51.250
didn't appeal to him.

51:51.334 --> 51:53.250
So he would get high
and watch stand-up comedy

51:53.334 --> 51:55.626
as a way to numb the agony
of how lost he felt.

51:55.709 --> 51:57.459
And in doing so,
he found a lot of connection

51:57.542 --> 51:59.834
with their points of view,
and he thought, "Wow,

51:59.918 --> 52:02.834
if I could do that, people
could connect to me like that."

52:02.918 --> 52:04.584
So he decided
to drop out of school

52:04.667 --> 52:05.792
and pursue stand-up comedy,

52:05.876 --> 52:07.918
and doing comedy made him
feel better for a moment,

52:08.000 --> 52:10.292
but it never forced him
to address any of the reasons

52:10.375 --> 52:11.876
he actually felt like shit.

52:11.959 --> 52:14.667
He so badly wanted
to feel special and powerful

52:14.751 --> 52:16.209
to make up for
how worthless he felt,

52:16.292 --> 52:18.209
so he would say all sorts
of fucked-up things,

52:18.292 --> 52:21.000
onstage and off,
as a way to separate himself.

52:21.083 --> 52:22.417
And a lot of it he stands by,

52:22.500 --> 52:24.125
but there are
a lot of things he said

52:24.209 --> 52:25.584
that were flagrant
and unnecessary

52:25.667 --> 52:26.792
and hurtful and racist

52:26.876 --> 52:29.584
and sexist and homophobic,
all of which he justified

52:29.667 --> 52:31.584
under the guise of
pushing the envelope,

52:31.667 --> 52:33.918
which he thought was an act
of justified rebellion

52:34.000 --> 52:35.626
against some
arbitrary authority.

52:35.709 --> 52:38.042
But too late, he learned
that a lot of those boundaries

52:38.125 --> 52:41.042
are derived from real people's
feelings and experiences

52:41.125 --> 52:43.292
and he was essentially
exploiting their actual pain

52:43.375 --> 52:46.000
and using it as a traffic cone
to satisfy this story

52:46.083 --> 52:48.167
he was telling himself
where he was a genius.

52:48.250 --> 52:49.626
And just because people laugh
at something

52:49.709 --> 52:51.292
doesn't inherently
make it good.

52:51.375 --> 52:53.375
They could be just as
emotionally immature

52:53.459 --> 52:55.125
or ignorant as
the perspective in the joke,

52:55.209 --> 52:57.626
or they could be responding
to joke structure and timing

52:57.709 --> 52:59.250
more than content.

52:59.334 --> 53:00.584
And then, one day...

53:00.667 --> 53:01.834
(MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING)

53:01.918 --> 53:04.167
...all the world's stages
boarded up, so he sat alone

53:04.250 --> 53:05.959
in a room for a year,
and he did nothing

53:06.042 --> 53:07.876
but talk to the walls
and a therapist.

53:07.959 --> 53:09.709
And with no emotion
to escape into,

53:09.792 --> 53:12.542
he slowly started breaking down
the paradigm he'd constructed

53:12.626 --> 53:15.209
and moved into the feelings
he was running from.

53:15.292 --> 53:17.167
And he discovered how badly
he had been hurting

53:17.250 --> 53:20.042
his entire life, and what it
actually is to hurt so badly.

53:20.125 --> 53:21.876
And he realized
that there was not a single

53:21.959 --> 53:24.500
period of his life
in which he was truly happy.

53:24.584 --> 53:26.125
And through that,
he started to realize

53:26.209 --> 53:27.876
how much pain
he had caused other people.

53:27.959 --> 53:30.042
He instantly regretted
all the ways in which

53:30.125 --> 53:31.876
he's needlessly made people
feel like shit

53:32.000 --> 53:33.542
in order to protect
his own conception

53:33.626 --> 53:35.125
of himself as strong.

53:35.209 --> 53:37.792
Then he wanted to disappear
from the world entirely

53:37.876 --> 53:39.959
because he felt like
such an incredibly bad person

53:40.042 --> 53:41.292
for having done these things.

53:41.375 --> 53:43.542
So his instinct was
to beat himself up about it

53:43.626 --> 53:45.459
and tell himself
what a horrible person he is,

53:45.542 --> 53:47.334
but he's been shaming himself
his entire life,

53:47.417 --> 53:48.876
and all these things he did
were just ways

53:48.959 --> 53:50.792
to push people away
and deprive himself

53:50.876 --> 53:52.125
of any meaningful connection,

53:52.209 --> 53:53.959
because of how badly
he felt about himself,

53:54.042 --> 53:56.626
because it was too scary
and painful to be open enough

53:56.709 --> 53:58.918
to connect to anyone else.
So, while he hurt people,

53:59.000 --> 54:00.584
he was hurting no one
more than himself,

54:00.667 --> 54:02.209
and he doesn't want
to do that anymore.

54:02.292 --> 54:04.000
He has worked so hard
to clear out space

54:04.083 --> 54:06.500
within himself and feel safer
in his own body

54:06.584 --> 54:08.584
and treat himself like
a friend he loves

54:08.667 --> 54:10.167
as opposed to
an enemy he hates,

54:10.250 --> 54:12.667
which means he no longer
tolerates dynamics based on

54:12.751 --> 54:14.584
his own self-destruction,
which has changed

54:14.667 --> 54:16.167
numerous relationships
in his life,

54:16.250 --> 54:18.417
including the one with
the art form that he loves.

54:18.500 --> 54:20.751
The fear has always been
that if he makes peace

54:20.834 --> 54:23.542
with the subterranean feelings
that drive all of this,

54:23.626 --> 54:25.000
he'd lose this piece
of himself

54:25.083 --> 54:27.417
which has helped him
survive and get to this point,

54:27.500 --> 54:29.042
a fear that he won't be
funny anymore,

54:29.125 --> 54:31.292
he won't be special,
he'll just be,

54:31.375 --> 54:32.834
which has been
an intolerable notion

54:32.918 --> 54:34.667
because he doesn't feel
like enough on his own.

54:34.751 --> 54:37.000
He's only known
how to exist by chasing,

54:37.083 --> 54:38.709
or thinking, or running,
or fighting,

54:38.792 --> 54:41.209
or straining, or suffering,
or striving, or analyzing,

54:41.292 --> 54:43.459
anxious energy
which ultimately manifests

54:43.542 --> 54:45.792
the very same emptiness
it's borne out of.

54:45.876 --> 54:48.167
And it keeps him locked
into one side of himself,

54:48.250 --> 54:50.083
but he's making every effort
to find a way

54:50.167 --> 54:51.500
to not give in
to those anxieties

54:51.584 --> 54:53.334
and sit with
the quiet inside of himself

54:53.417 --> 54:57.584
because he wants so badly
to get to the other side.
